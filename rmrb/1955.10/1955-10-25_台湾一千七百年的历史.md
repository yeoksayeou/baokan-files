    Taiwan's 1700-Year History
    Liu Danian
    Taiwan is a province of China. The recorded history of Taiwan has always been an integral part of Chinese history.

    Modern archaeological achievements provide knowledge of Taiwan's early history. As early as the Neolithic Age, it had cultural connections with mainland China. Ancient Chinese documents from several centuries before the Common Era contain various legends about Taiwan. The first formal historical record of Taiwan is found in the "Lin Hai Shui Tu Zhi" by Shen Ying of the Wu Kingdom during the Three Kingdoms period (mid-3rd century AD). Historical records have been continuous since then, spanning 1,700 years.

    In 230 AD, Wei Wen and Zhuge Zhi of the Wu Kingdom led a force of ten thousand people to Taiwan by sea. According to available materials, this was the earliest large-scale arrival of Han Chinese in Taiwan and marked the beginning of the Chinese people's use of advanced cultural knowledge to develop Taiwan. Before this arrival of Han Chinese, the island was inhabited by a portion of the people later known as the Gaoshan (High Mountain) people.

    The Sui Dynasty, established at the end of the 6th century, unified the north and south divisions of Chinese history. In 607 AD, Emperor Yang of Sui sent Zhu Kuan and He Man to Taiwan to "seek out exotic customs." Three years later, he sent Chen Leng and Zhang Zhenzhou with a force of over ten thousand from Guangdong, via Gao Hua Island and ?? Island, to Taiwan. The "Book of Sui" records Taiwan's products and climate, stating that the local area "is suitable for rice, sorghum, millet, glutinous millet, hemp beans, red beans, broad beans, and black beans. The trees include maple, 栝, camphor, pine, 楩, nanmu, fir, catalpa, bamboo, rattan, fruits, and medicinal herbs, similar to the Jiangbiao region. The climate and environment are similar to Lingnan." The Chinese people continued to engage in the development of Taiwan, accumulating rich production knowledge about the local area.

    Economic ties between Taiwan and the mainland, dating from the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, were generally uninterrupted. The Sun Wu, Eastern Jin, Song, Qi, and Liang dynasties all engaged in active maritime trade. Taiwan held a certain position in this extensive maritime trade. The "Book of Sui," in the biography of Chen Leng, mentions that when Chen Leng and his group first arrived in Taiwan, the local residents saw the ships and came to trade, indicating that Taiwan had a long-standing habit of commerce with the mainland. In Taipei, archaeologists discovered a type of palm-sized ancient brick belonging to the Three Kingdoms period. The "Book of Sui" says that the local custom was to "bathe the corpse and wrap it in cloth" after death. Early discoveries in Tainan include Tang and Song dynasty pottery bottles and ancient coins. These cloths and objects were naturally brought to Taiwan by Han Chinese.

    After the Southern Song Dynasty, the number of Han Chinese settling in Taiwan increased. In the early 12th century, the shift of China's political center from the Central Plains to the Jiangnan region objectively promoted the development of Taiwan. At the same time, as most areas of the mainland suffered years of war and social life was turbulent, residents from northern China also migrated to Taiwan. With the increase in the settled Han population, traffic between Taiwan and the mainland became more frequent. The Chinese government first implemented effective administrative management of Penghu, a crucial transportation hub. Zhao Rushi's "Zhu Fan Zhi" of the Southern Song Dynasty stated: "Quan (zhou) has an island called Penghu, which belongs to Jinjiang County." Wang Dayuan's "Dao Yi Zhi Lue" of the Yuan Dynasty and local chronicles of Quanzhou cited in Ming Dynasty notes also state that during the Southern Song Dynasty, Penghu was administered by Jinjiang County, and residents had disputes that were "resolved by Jinjiang County." This shows that at the latest from the 12th century, Penghu was formally administered by the Chinese government and became part of China's administrative territory.

    The Yuan Dynasty government established the Penghu Patrol and Inspection Office in the late 13th century. This marked the beginning of China's establishment of specialized administrative institutions on islands near Taiwan.

    From the mid-16th century onward, the ruling Ming Dynasty's power in China began to decline. Maritime incursions, which began in the Yuan Dynasty, now became a new external threat on China's borders. In addition to Japan, Western colonialists successively arrived in the East. Taiwan and certain ports on mainland China became targets for their seizure and plunder. The people of Taiwan and the mainland had to engage in various struggles to resist foreign aggression. After 1563, there were struggles against Japanese incursions into Taiwan; from 1603 to 1624, there were two struggles against the Dutch occupation of Penghu; from 1624 to 1661, there were struggles against the Dutch occupation of southern Taiwan; and from 1626 to 1642, there were struggles against the Spanish occupation of northern Taiwan. Among these, the struggle against the Dutch lasted the longest and was the most intense. The people of Taiwan and the mainland together achieved victory in each of these struggles.

    In that long and complex struggle, Han Chinese, centered around maritime civilian armed forces, established the earliest regime on the island of Taiwan. Zheng Zhilong, a native of Nan'an, Fujian, became the leader of Taiwan in 1625, resisting the Dutch aggression against Taiwan. The early Han-Chinese established regime in the Taiwan region resisted foreign aggression forces under different circumstances and promoted the development of local production.

    The Han Chinese population migrating to Taiwan increased rapidly during this time. From about 1624 to 1644, during the twenty years, about 25,000 households of Han Chinese people from Fujian and Guangdong went to Taiwan. In 1644, Taiwan had a Han Chinese population of about 30,000 households, totaling about 100,000 people. The large number of Han Chinese people migrating to Taiwan made a decisive contribution to the development of the area.

    Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga, Zheng Zhilong's son) entering Taiwan became a new starting point for the historical development of this region. From the beginning, he waged an active struggle against the Dutch aggressors who were entrenched in Taiwan and constantly plundering Fujian and Guangdong. Zheng Chenggong had high prestige among the people of Taiwan, who regarded him as their liberator. In 1661, Zheng Chenggong personally led a large army of 25,000 men into Taiwan to recover the area occupied by the Dutch. The Dutch colonial army struggled to resist, resulting in over 1,600 casualties, and surrendered to Zheng Chenggong in February 1662.

    Zheng Chenggong, on one hand, rectified the political system, trained soldiers, and eliminated the remaining forces of the aggressors; on the other hand, he encouraged agriculture, established schools, and devoted himself to economic development and cultural advancement. Zheng Chenggong died of illness in 1662, and his son Zheng Jing and grandson Zheng Keshuang continued to rule Taiwan for a total of twenty-three years. Zheng Chenggong is a famous patriotic hero in Chinese history, and he has always been revered by the Chinese people for expelling foreign aggressors in Taiwan.

    Of particular significance were the measures taken by the Zheng regime to improve agricultural production among the Gaoshan people and to develop the cultural life of the Gaoshan people. From the beginning, Zheng Chenggong earnestly protected the interests of the Gaoshan people. He treated the Gaoshan people and the Han Chinese completely equally. When the army reclaimed wasteland, the government issued strict prohibitions, "not allowing the encroachment of indigenous people and the property currently cultivated by the people." At this time, the Gaoshan people did not know about plowing with oxen, nor did they know how to use agricultural implements such as plows, hoes, hooks, and sickles. After the rice matured, they would pick each head individually. Yang Ying, an official of the Zheng regime, proposed that each Gaoshan village be issued a mature ox, a set of iron plows, and a set of iron harrows, and that experienced farmers be sent to each village to teach ox-plowing and the use of advanced agricultural implements. After some Gaoshan people accepted the production techniques of Han Chinese farmers, their lives improved. At the same time, in terms of culture, the Zheng regime also encouraged Gaoshan children to attend school and receive education. The cultural knowledge spread by the Han Chinese unprecedentedly raised the cultural living standards of the Gaoshan people.

    But Taiwan, after all, is a small area, and once it severed contact with the mainland, it was in a completely isolated position, which could not be sustained for long. In 1683, Taiwan returned to the unified regime of the Qing Dynasty.

    Taiwan, under the rule of a unified national regime, had a positive effect on the local and national economic and cultural development. Before the Opium War, it shielded Taiwan from external interference; and ensuring Taiwan also helped to stabilize the peaceful living environment of the coastal provinces. The unification of the Qing Dynasty promoted the rapid development of Taiwan's economy and culture. The people of Taiwan and the people of the whole country were closely related in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life, becoming an inseparable whole.

    Under the rule of the Qing government, a large amount of land in Taiwan was developed, handicrafts and commerce rose, and economic life showed a prosperous scene. According to statistics from 1811, the population of Taiwan had increased to 2,386,161 people. The vast majority of these increased population were working people who migrated from the mainland to Taiwan, mainly farmers. Han Chinese farmers and Gaoshan people were the direct producers of social wealth in the Taiwan region.

    The social life of the Gaoshan people now had further changes and development. Some Gaoshan people used plows and harrows to cultivate the land, similar to the Han Chinese. There were also ox carts among the production tools. There was primitive family handicraft industry, and women could weave wool cloth and linen cloth with wooden machines. According to statistics during the Yongzheng period (1723-1735), the Gaoshan people who paid poll tax to the Qing government every year included 59 large villages and more than 120 small villages. Each village had at least 40 to 50 male adults, and the most had 700 to 800 people. The political, economic, and cultural life of most Gaoshan villages were further linked with the Han Chinese.

    Britain launched the Opium War in 1840, and foreign capitalism began to invade China. Since then, in Chinese history, there has been a sharp struggle between the Chinese people's opposition to imperialism and feudalism, turning China into an independent and prosperous country, and imperialism and feudalism turning China into a colony. Taiwan has always occupied an important position in this life-and-death struggle between the two lines. Because, like other provinces in the southeast coast, it came into contact with foreign capitalist aggressors earlier, suffered deeper disasters directly, and the people have always been at the forefront of the struggle.

    During and after the Opium War, Britain, the United States, Japan, and France continuously launched armed aggression against Taiwan, overturning the Qing government's view of Taiwan as "trouble arises from within, rarely from outside." Especially after 1874, the military attacks of the United States, Japan, and France made the Qing government realize the importance of Taiwan in national defense and began to make the goal of governing Taiwan preventing aggressors from forcibly occupying Taiwan.

    After the end of the Sino-French War, Fujian Governor Liu Mingchuan suggested that the Qing government strengthen Taiwan's defense. In October 1885, the Qing government decided to establish Taiwan as a province, with Liu Mingchuan as governor, and established the provincial capital in Changhua. By the eve of the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Taiwan Province had a total of three prefectures, one directly subordinate prefecture, six sub-prefectures, and eleven counties, totaling 3.2 million people.

    Before and after the establishment of the province, under the proposal of Shen Baozhen, Liu Mingchuan and others, many important measures were taken in national defense, industry, and cultural construction. From 1874, forts were built in Anping, Qi Hou, Keelung, Tamsui, and Penghu, new-style cannons were installed, and troops were stationed. After 1874, more than 1,500 miles of submarine and land electric lines were erected. In 1875, the Keelung coal mine was started to be mined with machines. From 1877, the railway from Taipei to Keelung and Taipei to Hsinchu was built successively, becoming one of the earliest railways in China. In 1877, a new school was established to teach mathematics, physics and chemistry, history and geography, surveying and mapping, and other subjects, and later a telegraph school was established. In 1885, a machine bureau was built, and in 1886, a cannonball manufacturing plant, a gunpowder bureau, and a mine camp were established. At this time, Taiwan was not only an important province in national defense, but also an advanced province in economy and culture.

    April 17, 1895, was a dark day in Taiwan's history. On this day, the Qing government, due to military defeats in the Sino-Japanese War, was forced to send the traitor Li Hongzhang as a representative, under the conspiracy, deception, and threats of the US government, to sign the humiliating Treaty of Shimonoseki with Japan. The Treaty of Shimonoseki stipulated that the Qing government ceded the entire island of Taiwan and all affiliated islands. From then on, the Japanese aggressors took this treaty as the basis for their forcible occupation of China's territory of Taiwan.

    At that time, a sharp opposition was formed between the people of the whole country and the Qing ruling group around the issue of ceding Taiwan. When the bad news of ceding Taiwan reached Taiwan, the compatriots in Taiwan "heard the roar of thunder in the middle of the night... Running around to tell each other, gathering to cry in the city, day and night, the cries reached the four fields" [1], showing unrestrained grief and indignation. The Taiwanese scholars who were taking the imperial examination in Beijing jointly wrote to the Censorate to fight for it. The gentry and people of the whole Taiwan sent telegrams directly to the Qing government, resolutely opposing the negotiation of peace by ceding land. The Qing government ignored them all. On the second day after the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Taipei City sounded gongs to close the market, angrily protesting the Qing government's treasonous crimes. The compatriots in the whole Taiwan were all determined to "live and die with the homeland." The masses "were willing to join the army to kill the bandits, and there were thousands of people every day" [2]. "All were prepared to fight the Japanese to the death, and were unwilling to cede the whole Taiwan to the Japanese. With the united will of the people, there was no second choice but to die" [3]. The people of the mainland also felt "heartache and despair, and there was no way to call for help" [4], and hated the Qing government's treason to the bone. At that time, the "Shen Bao", published in Shanghai, with the title "On the Righteous Indignation of the Taiwanese People, Which Is Enough to Shock Distant People", bluntly stated that "My ruler can be deceived, but my people cannot be deceived; my officials can be played with, but my people cannot be played with"! It clearly pointed out the fundamental difference between the people's line of resistance and the rulers' line of surrender. The voices of the broad masses of the people were also clearly reflected in the words of progressive intellectuals at that time. Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao and others launched the famous "Public Carriage Petition", opposing the cession of Taiwan and advocating the relocation of the capital to resist the war.

    Despite the Qing government's handover of Taiwan, the people have always resolutely resisted and unanimously supported Liu Yongfu, the defending general of Tainan, to lead the resistance against Japan. The people of Taiwan were not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice in order to defend the territory of the motherland, and fought against the Japanese invaders for five months without yielding in hundreds of battles. During this time, the Japanese invaders suffered a serious blow from the people of Taiwan, with a total of more than 32,300 killed and wounded, and nearly half of the main force of the invading army, the Konoe Division, was annihilated. This epic history of the Taiwanese people's resistance against Japan will not diminish its value because of the exhaustion of assistance and defeat.

    Until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, Japanese imperialism implemented fifty years of colonial rule in Taiwan Province of our country. Its main content was a brutal colonial rule order, which was a bone-marrow colonial exploitation. The heroic and unyielding people of Taiwan, in order to return to the embrace of the motherland, in order to oppose the oppression, extraction, and enslavement of the Japanese aggressors, carried out a tenacious struggle against the Japanese rule for a full half-century. During half a century, the armed uprisings against Japan held by the people in various parts of Taiwan almost never stopped for a single day. Among them, the most influential were the Taichung Uprising led by young worker Ke Tie in 1896, the uprisings led by Jian Dashi, Lu Yongchun and others in Taipei in 1899, the Beipu Uprising in 1907, the Lin Qipu Uprising and the Tuku Uprising in 1912, the Miaoli Uprising organized by Tongmenghui member Luo Fuxing in 1913, the Xilai'an Uprising in 1915, and the Wushe Uprising launched by Gaoshan compatriots in 1930. This fact shows the Chinese people's unwavering will to resolutely oppose aggression and demand liberation.

    The National Anti-Japanese National Liberation War broke out in 1937. On December 9, 1941, the Chinese government at that time officially declared war on Japan, stating that "all treaties, agreements, and contracts involving Sino-Japanese relations are hereby abolished." This statement was the result of a long-term struggle by the people of the whole country, including the people of Taiwan, fundamentally denying the Treaty of Shimonoseki and all unequal treaties between China and Japan, and resolutely demanding the recovery of Chinese territories such as Taiwan.

    Based on long-term and complete historical facts, the important international agreements during the Anti-Japanese War reaffirmed that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. The "Cairo Declaration" jointly signed by the governments of China, the United Kingdom, and the United States on December 1, 1943, stipulated that: "The purpose of the three countries is...to return to China the territories that Japan has stolen from China, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands." The "Potsdam Proclamation," jointly signed by China, the United Kingdom, and the United States on July 26, 1945, and later joined by the Soviet Union, once again stipulated that: "The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be implemented, and Japan's sovereignty shall be limited to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and other small islands as we determine."

    Japan was defeated and announced its unconditional surrender on August 14, 1945. On September 2, the Japanese representative signed the surrender document, and the first clause of the surrender document stipulated that Japan accepted "all the clauses in the Potsdam Proclamation." The Chinese government at that time held the Taiwan Province Surrender Ceremony at the Taipei Public Hall on October 25 of the same year. Hundreds of people, including the representative of US President Truman, attended the ceremony. Chen Yi, the chief Chinese surrender officer, delivered a radio address on the spot after the surrender: "From today on, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are formally returning to the territory of China, and all land, people, and political affairs have been placed under the sovereignty of the Chinese government. I hereby report this extremely historically significant fact to the compatriots of the whole country and the world." [5]

    Taiwan has returned to China; after 50 years of arduous struggle and the sacrifice of more than 500,000 lives, the people of Taiwan have finally shaken off the enslavement of Japanese imperialism and returned to the embrace of the motherland!

    After Taiwan returned to China, China carried out political and military management and restored its sovereignty over Taiwan. The Allied governments during the war against Japan also clearly recognized this fact in their subsequent statements. On January 5, 1950, US President Truman said in a statement on Taiwan: The purpose of the Cairo Declaration was "to return to China the territory seized by Japan from China, such as Taiwan. The United States is a signatory to the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945. The Potsdam Proclamation states that the terms of the Cairo Declaration should be implemented immediately. Japan also accepted the provisions of this declaration when it surrendered. ... Over the past four years, the United States and other allies have also recognized China's exercise of sovereignty over the island." [6] On February 9, 1950, the US State Department's public response to the US House Foreign Affairs Committee on the Taiwan issue stated that since the Japanese troops stationed in Taiwan surrendered to China, Taiwan has been administered by China. "It has been included in China and has become a province. ... The allies participating in the war against Japan did not question these steps. The US government did not question these steps either. Because these steps clearly complied with the promises made in Cairo and reaffirmed in Potsdam. In other words, the allies, including the United States, have considered Taiwan to be a part of China in the past four years." [7] On November 21, 1949, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mayhew said in the British House of Commons: "It was on the basis of the Cairo Declaration that the Chinese authorities took control of the island when Japan surrendered, and have since exercised control over the island." [8] On August 25, 1954, a British Foreign Office spokesman admitted: "The Cairo Declaration said that Taiwan should be returned to the Chinese government, and this has been done." [9]

    Taiwan returned to China, China restored its sovereignty over Taiwan, and the people of Taiwan achieved a complete victory in resisting the Japanese aggressors. From 1945, this important historical event has been written and highlighted in the glorious history of the modern Chinese people's resistance against foreign aggression.

    After the Kuomintang reactionary government took over Taiwan, the people of Taiwan did not get the free, equal, and happy living environment they dreamed of. Not long after Japan surrendered, the US imperialism, which had always harbored the ambition to invade Taiwan, quickly infiltrated Taiwan on a large scale from all aspects of politics, military, economy, and culture through its running dog, the Kuomintang traitor government. In a very short period of time, the United States controlled Taiwan's military bases and economic lifeline, and actually replaced Japan's rule in Taiwan. In 1946, the United States obtained the privilege to "freely operate various enterprises" in Taiwan through the "Sino-US Commercial Treaty." In 1948, the United States and the Jiang thief traitorous group signed a "Joint Development of Taiwan" agreement, massively plundering various important resources such as local petroleum, tungsten, aluminum, antimony, copper, gold, and sulfur, and some agricultural products. Under the cruel exploitation of the US and Jiang, the people of Taiwan lived an extremely impoverished life. The exorbitant taxes and levies imposed by the Jiang thief on the people amounted to more than 53 million yuan in counterfeit currency in 1949, and increased to more than 1.98 billion yuan in 1953, an increase of more than 36 times in four years. After the US imperialism and its running dogs were driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people in 1949, the United States tried to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. In June 1950, the United States launched a war of aggression against Korea, and after US President Truman issued a statement on armed intervention in Taiwan, the United States has been using armed force to protect its running dog Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to continue to occupy Taiwan.

    The heroic and unyielding people of Taiwan, after countless struggles against foreign aggressors in different historical periods, now have to make a final fight with the US imperialism and its running dogs, and the disasters they have suffered are extremely profound. However, the struggle of the people of Taiwan against the US imperialism and its running dogs will surely be victorious with the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. 1700 years of facts prove that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the people of Taiwan and the social life of Taiwan have always been inseparably linked with the people of the whole country and the social life of the whole country. At present, the people of the whole country are actively participating in the sacred struggle to liberate Taiwan. The rule of the US imperialism and its running dogs there cannot last for a long time. The Chinese people must complete the cause of unifying their motherland's territorial sovereignty, and the people of Taiwan must return to the embrace of the motherland. This is something that no force can stop and is bound to be realized!

    台湾一千七百年的历史
    刘大年
    台湾是中国的一省。台湾地方的有记载的历史，始终是中国历史的一个组成部分。
    近代考古学的成就，提供了台湾早期的历史知识。远在新石器时代，它就和中国大陆有了文化联系。纪元前几个世纪产生的中国古代文献里，有关于台湾的种种传说。第一次正式记录台湾历史的，是三国（公元三世纪中期）吴人沈莹的“临海水土志”。往后史不绝书，至今已有一千七百年。
    公元二三○年，吴国卫温、诸葛直率众万人，浮海至台湾。据现在所知道的材料，这是汉族人最早的大规模到达台湾的一次，也是中国人民利用先进的文化知识开发台湾的开始。在这次汉族人到达台湾以前，那里居住着后来称为高山族的一部分人民。
    六世纪末建立起的隋朝，统一了中国历史上南北朝的局面。六百○七年，隋炀帝派朱宽、何蛮到台湾“求访异俗”。三年以后，又派陈棱、张镇州率众万余人，从广东出发，经高华屿、??屿到台湾。“隋书”上记载台湾的物产气候说：本地“宜稻、粱、禾、黍、麻豆、赤豆、胡豆、黑豆等。木有枫、栝、樟、松、楩、楠、杉、梓、竹、藤、果、药，同于江表。风土气候，与岭南相类。”中国人民是在继续从事开发台湾的活动，而且积累了关于当地的丰富的生产知识。
    台湾和大陆经济生活的联系，自东汉末年往后大抵没有间断过。孙吴、东晋、宋、齐、梁各朝，都有活跃的海上贸易。台湾在大量的海上贸易中有一定的地位。“隋书”陈棱传说：陈棱等人初到台湾，当地居民看见船舰，都去做生意，说明台湾与大陆早有通商贸易的习惯。在台北，考古学者发现一种属于三国时代的指掌型古砖。“隋书”上说：当地的风俗，人死以后“浴其尸，以布帛裹之”。台南也很早就发现有唐、宋时代的瓦瓶、古钱等器物。这些布帛、器物，自然是汉族人输入台湾的。
    南宋以后，汉族人定居于台湾的增多了。十二世纪初期，中国的政治中心由中原移到江南，对台湾的开发在客观上起了促进的作用。同时，由于大陆大部分地区连年遭受战争破坏，社会生活动荡不安，中国北部居民也有流入台湾的。因定居的汉族人口增加，台湾与大陆的交通日见频繁。中国政府首先对交通要冲的澎湖实施了有效的行政管理。南宋人赵汝适所作“诸蕃志”说：“泉（州）有海岛，曰澎湖，隶晋江县”。元人汪大渊“岛夷志略”和明人笔记引用的泉州地方志中，也说南宋时澎湖归晋江县管辖，居民有争讼，“取决于晋江县”。这说明最晚自十二世纪起，澎湖已正式属中国政府管理，成为中国行政区域的一部分。
    元朝政府于十三世纪后期更在澎湖设立巡检司。中国在台湾附近的岛屿上设立专门的行政机构，自此开始。
    十六世纪中叶往后，统治中国的明朝政权的实力已趋向衰落。从元代开始的海上侵扰，现在成了中国边境上新的外患。日本之外，西方殖民主义者陆续到东方来活动。台湾和中国大陆的某些港口，成了他们抢占、掠夺的对象。台湾和大陆上的人民，此时要进行各种各样的反抗外国侵略势力的斗争。一五六三年以后，有反对日本侵扰台湾的斗争；一六○三年至一六二四年，有两次反对荷兰侵占澎湖的斗争；一六二四至一六六一年，有反对荷兰占领台湾南部的斗争；一六二六至一六四二年，还有反对西班牙占领台湾北部的斗争。其中反对荷兰的斗争时间最久，斗争也最激烈。台湾人民和大陆人民一起，在历次斗争中都取得了胜利。
    在那长期的、复杂的斗争过程中，汉族人以海上民间武装力量为中心，建立起了台湾本岛上的最早的政权。福建南安人郑芝龙于一六二五年为台湾首领，反抗荷兰对台湾的侵略。汉族人早期建立的台湾地区的政权，在不同的情形下反抗了外国侵略势力，推动了当地生产事业的发展。
    移居台湾的汉族人口，此时在迅速增加。大约自一六二四到一六四四年的二十年间，闽、粤一带的汉族人民，到台湾去的有二万五千户。一六四四年时，台湾有汉族人口约三万户，共十万人左右。大量的汉族人民移居台湾，对那里的开发有决定性的贡献。
    郑成功（郑芝龙的儿子）进入台湾，成为这个地区历史发展的一个新的起点。他一开始就同盘踞在台湾，不断寇掠闽粤的荷兰侵略势力作了积极的斗争。郑成功在台湾人民中有很高的威信，人们把他看作是自己的解放者。一六六一年，郑成功亲率大军二万五千人进入台湾，规复荷兰占领的区域。荷兰殖民军挣扎抵抗，结果死伤士兵一千六百余人，于一六六二年二月向郑成功投降。
    郑成功一面整顿政治，训练士卒，肃清侵略者的残余势力；同时奖励农业，兴办学校，努力于经济开发和文化的发展。一六六二年，郑成功病死，他的儿子郑经、孙子郑克塽继续统治台湾共达二十三年。郑成功是中国历史上著名的爱国英雄，他驱除了在台湾的外国侵略势力，一直受到中国人民的崇敬。
    有特别重要意义的，是郑氏政权努力改进高山族的农业生产和发展高山族人民文化生活的措施。郑成功自始即认真保护高山族人的利益。他对高山族人和汉族人，完全同样看待。军队垦荒时，政府颁布严格的禁令，“不准混侵土民及百姓现耕物业”。高山族此时还不知道牛耕，不知道利用犁、锄、钩、镰一类的农具。禾稻成熟后，要逐穗采拔。郑氏户官杨英创议：每一高山族村社发熟牛一头，铁犁、铁耙各一副，派有经验的农民到各社传授牛耕和使用先进农具的方法。一部分高山族人接受了汉族农民的生产技术以后，生活得到了改善。同时，在文化上，郑氏政权也鼓励高山族儿童入学受教育。汉族人传播的文化知识，空前地提高了高山族人的文化生活水平。
    但是台湾毕竟是个很小的地区，它一旦断绝了与大陆的联系，便处于完全孤立的地位，不可能长久支持下去。一六八三年，台湾又回到清朝政府统一的政权之下了。
    台湾处于统一的全国政权的统治下，对于当地和全国的经济、文化发展，均有积极的作用。在鸦片战争以前，它使台湾免受外力的干扰；而确保台湾也有助于沿海各省和平生活环境的稳固。清朝的统一，促进了台湾经济、文化的迅速发展。台湾人民和全国人民在政治、经济、文化生活等各方面息息相关，成为一个不可分割的整体。
    在清政府统治下，台湾土地大量开发，手工业、商业兴起，经济生活呈现出繁荣景象。据一八一一年统计，台湾人口已增加至二百万三千八百六十一人。这些增加的人口，绝大多数是大陆上迁移到台湾的劳动人民，主要是农民。汉族农民和高山族人是台湾这个地区社会财富的直接生产者。
    高山族的社会生活，现在有了进一步的变化和发展。一部分高山族人使用犁耙等农具耕作，与汉族人相同。生产工具中并有牛车。有了原始的家庭手工业，妇女能用木机织毛布、麻布。雍正（一七二三——一七三五）年间的统计，每年向清政府缴纳丁口税的高山族，有大社五十九个，小社一百二十余个。各社最少有男丁四、五十人，最多的有七、八百人。大部分高山族村社的政治、经济和文化生活，是进一步地和汉族人联结在一起了。
    英国在一八四○年发动鸦片战争，外国资本主义开始侵入中国。从此中国历史上出现了中国人民反对帝国主义、封建主义，把中国变为独立富强国家的路线同帝国主义、封建主义把中国变为殖民地的路线的尖锐斗争。台湾在这两条路线的生死斗争中，一直占有重要的地位。因为它和东南沿海的其他省份一样，与外国资本主义侵略势力接触较早，直接受到的灾害较深，人民始终处在斗争的前线。
    鸦片战争中和以后，英、美、日、法各国连续武装侵略台湾，推翻了清政府对台湾的“乱自内生，鲜有外至”的看法。特别是一八七四年以后，美国、日本和法国的军事进攻，使清政府明白认识到了台湾在国防上的重要性，开始以防止侵略者强占台湾为治台的目标。
    中法战争结束，福建巡抚刘铭传建议清政府加强台湾防务。清政府于一八八五年十月决定建台湾为一省，以刘铭传为巡抚，在彰化境内设立省城。到一八九四年中日战争前夕，台湾省共有三府、一直隶州、六厅、十一县，共三百二十万人。
    建省前后，经沈葆桢、刘铭传等人创议，在国防、工业、文化建设等方面采取了许多重要措施。一八七四年起，在安平、旗后、基隆、淡水、澎湖修筑炮台，设置新式大炮，派兵驻守。一八七四年以后，陆续架设水陆电线一千五百余里。一八七五年开始用机器开采基隆煤矿。一八七七年起，先后修筑台北至基隆、台北至新竹的铁路，成为中国最早的铁路之一。一八七七年设新学堂，教授算学、理化、史地、测绘等学科，以后又设电报学堂。一八八五年兴建机器局，一八八六年又开办炮弹制造厂、火药局、水雷营等等。此时台湾不仅在国防上是一个重要的省份，在经济、文化上也是一个先进的省份。
    一八九五年四月十七日是台湾历史上一个黑暗的日子。这一天，清政府因在中日战争中遭到军事上的失败，被迫派卖国贼李鸿章为代表，在美国政府阴谋、诈骗、威胁之下，同日本缔结了屈辱的马关条约。马关条约中规定清政府割让台湾全岛及所有附属各岛屿。日本侵略者从此便拿着这一纸条约，作为他们强占中国领土台湾的根据。
    其时环绕着割台问题，全国人民和清朝统治集团之间形成了尖锐的对立。割台凶耗传到台湾时，台湾同胞“若午夜暴闻轰雷，……奔走相告，聚哭于市中，夜以继日，哭声达于四野”〔一〕，表现了不可抑止的悲愤。正在北京会试的台湾举人，联合上书都察院力争。全台绅民直接打电报给清政府，坚决反对割地议和。清政府一概置之不理。台北市于马关条约签字的第二天鸣锣罢市，愤怒抗议清政府的卖国罪行。全台同胞人人抱定“桑梓之地，义与存亡”的决心。群众“愿投效杀贼者，日有千数百人”〔二〕。“一律预备与倭人决一死战，不愿将全台归与倭人，众志成城，有死无二”〔三〕。大陆人民，同样是人人感到“痛心疾首，呼天无路”〔四〕，对清政府的卖国恨入骨髓。当时在上海出版的“申报”以“论台民义愤亦足以震慑远人”为题，直言“我君可欺，而我民不可欺；我官可玩，而我民不可玩”！明确指出人民抵抗路线和统治者投降路线的根本差别。广大人民的呼声，在当时进步知识分子的言论中也得到清楚的反映。康有为、梁启超等发动的著名的“公车上书”，反对割台，主张迁都抗战。
    尽管清政府交割台湾，人民则始终坚决抵抗，一致拥护台南守将刘永福领导抗日。台湾人民为保卫祖国的领土，不怕流血牺牲，百战不屈，抗击日寇达五个月之久。在这个时间内，日寇遭受了台湾人民的严重打击，毙伤总人数多至三万二千三百余人，侵台主力军近卫师团被歼灭的将近半数。台湾人民这一段可歌可泣的抗日历史，决不因为援竭而败减损其价值。
    直到一九四五年抗日战争胜利，日本帝国主义在我国的台湾省实行了五十年的殖民统治。其主要内容是残暴的殖民统治秩序，是敲骨沥髓的殖民剥削。英勇不屈的台湾人民为归回祖国的怀抱，为反对日本侵略者的压迫、榨取、奴役，对日本统治进行了整整半世纪之久的顽强斗争。半个世纪中，台湾各地人民举行的抗日武装起义，几乎不曾有一天中断。其中影响最大的，有一八九六年青年工人柯铁领导的台中起义，一八九九年简大狮、卢永春等在台北的起义，一九○七年的北埔起义，一九一二年的林屺埔起义、土库起义，一九一三年同盟会员罗福星组织的苗栗起义，一九一五年的西来庵起义，一九三○年高山族同胞发动的雾社起义等等。这个事实，表现出了中国人民坚决反对侵略，要求解放的百折不回的意志。
    一九三七年全国抗日民族解放战争爆发。一九四一年十二月九日，当时的中国政府正式对日宣战，声明“所有一切条约、协定、合同有涉及中日间之关系者，一律废止”。这项声明，是全国人民包括台湾人民在内进行了长期斗争，根本否认马关条约和一切中日不平等条约，坚决要求收复台湾等中国领土所产生的效果。
    根据长期的、全部的历史事实，抗日战争期间的重要国际协定，重新肯定了台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。一九四三年十二月一日，中、英、美三国政府共同签署的“开罗宣言”中规定：“三国之宗旨在……使日本窃取于中国之领土，例如满洲、台湾、澎湖列岛等，归还中国”。一九四五年七月二十六日中、英、美三国共同签署，后来又有苏联参加的“波茨坦公告”中再次规定：“开罗宣言之条件必将实施，而日本之主权必将限于本州、北海道、九州、四国及吾人所决定之其他小岛之内”。
    日本战败，于一九四五年八月十四日宣布无条件投降。九月二日日本代表在投降书上签字，降书第一款规定：日本接受“波茨坦公告中的各条款”。中国当时的政府于同年十月二十五日在台北公会堂举行台湾省受降仪式，出席观礼的有美国总统杜鲁门的代表等数百人。中国受降主官陈仪于受降后即席发表广播演说：“从今天起，台湾及澎湖列岛正式重入中国版图，所有一切土地、人民、政事皆已置于中国政府主权之下。此一极富有历史意义之事实，本人特向全国同胞及全世界报告周知。”〔五〕
    台湾归还中国了；台湾人民艰苦斗争五十年，牺牲了五十万以上的生命，终于摆脱了日本帝国主义的奴役，重新回到祖国的怀抱中来了！
    台湾归还中国后，中国即进行政治、军事上的管理，恢复了在台湾的主权。对日作战期间的同盟国政府，也在它们后来历次发表的声明中，明确承认了这个事实。一九五○年一月五日，美国总统杜鲁门在关于台湾的声明中说：开罗宣言的目的、是
  “使日本所窃取于中国领土，如台湾，归还中国。美国是一九四五年七月二十六日波茨坦公告的签字国。波茨坦公告称：开罗宣言条款应即执行。日本投降时，亦曾接受此宣言的规定。……过去四年来，美国及其他盟国亦承认中国对该岛行使主权”〔六〕。一九五○年二月九日，美国国务院就台湾问题对美国众议院外交委员会的公开答复中说：自从驻在台湾的日军向中国投降以后，台湾就由中国管理。“它已包括在中国之内，成为一省。……参加对日作战的各盟国对这些步骤并未质疑。美国政府对这些步骤也未质疑。因为这些步骤，明显地符合于开罗所作的并在波茨坦重予确认的诺言。换句话说，包括美国在内的各盟国在过去四年中，已认为台湾是中国的一部分。”〔七〕一九四九年十一月二十一日，英国外交部次官梅休在英国下院说：“是根据开罗宣言，中国当局在日本投降的时候，对该岛加以控制，并在此后一直行使着对该岛的控制。”〔八〕一九五四年八月二十五日，英国外交部发言人承认：“开罗宣言说，台湾应归还中国政府，这一点已经做到了。”〔九〕
    台湾归还了中国，中国恢复了对台湾的主权，台湾人民获得了反抗日本侵略者的彻底胜利。从一九四五年起，这个重要的历史事件，便大书而特书，载在近代中国人民反抗外国侵略的辉煌史册上。
    国民党反动政府接收台湾以后，台湾人民并没有得到他们所梦寐向往的自由、平等、幸福的生活环境。日本投降不久，一贯抱有侵占台湾野心的美国帝国主义迅速通过其走狗国民党卖国政府把自己的势力从政治、军事、经济、文化等各方面大规模地侵入了台湾。在很短的时间内，美国就控制了台湾的军事基地和经济命脉，实际上代替了日本在台湾的统治。一九四六年，美国便通过“中美商约”取得在台湾“自由经营各种企业”的特权。一九四八年美国和蒋贼卖国集团签订了一项“共同开发台湾”协定，大规模地掠夺当地的石油、钨、铝、锑、铜、黄金、硫磺等各种重要资源和一部分农产品。在美、蒋残酷压榨下，台湾人民过着极端贫困的生活。蒋贼向人民征收的苛捐杂税，一九四九年税收额为伪币五千三百多万元，一九五三年增加为十九亿八千多万元，四年间增加了三十六倍多。一九四九年美帝国主义及其走狗被中国人民从大陆上赶出去以后，美国力图阻止中国人民解放台湾。一九五○年六月，美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争，美总统杜鲁门发表武装干涉台湾声明之后，美国更一直用武装保护它的走狗蒋介石卖国集团继续盘踞台湾。
    英勇不屈的台湾人民，在不同的历史时期经过了无数次的反对外国侵略势力的斗争，现在还要同美帝国主义及其走狗作最后的搏斗，他们所受的灾难是极其深重的。但是台湾人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，在全国人民的共同努力下，必定获得胜利。一千七百年的事实证明：台湾是中国的领土，台湾人民、台湾的社会生活从来就是和全国人民、全国的社会生活不可分割地联系在一起的。目前全国人民正在积极参加解放台湾的神圣斗争，美帝国主义及其走狗在那里的统治决不能长期苟存下去。中国人民要完成统一自己祖国的领土主权的事业，台湾人民要回到祖国的怀抱中来，这是任何力量都阻止不了的，是必定要实现的！
