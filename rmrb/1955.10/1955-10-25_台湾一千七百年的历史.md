    Taiwan's 1700-Year History
    Liu Danian
    Taiwan is a province of China. The recorded history of Taiwan has always been an integral part of Chinese history.

    Modern archaeological achievements provide knowledge of Taiwan's early history. As early as the Neolithic Age, it had cultural connections with mainland China. Ancient Chinese documents from several centuries before the Common Era contain various legends about Taiwan. The first formal historical record of Taiwan is found in the "Lin Hai Shui Tu Zhi" by Shen Ying of the Wu Kingdom during the Three Kingdoms period (mid-3rd century AD). Historical records have been continuous since then, spanning 1,700 years.

    In 230 AD, Wei Wen and Zhuge Zhi of the Wu Kingdom led a force of ten thousand people to Taiwan by sea. According to available materials, this was the earliest large-scale arrival of Han Chinese in Taiwan and marked the beginning of the Chinese people's use of advanced cultural knowledge to develop Taiwan. Before this arrival of Han Chinese, the island was inhabited by a portion of the people later known as the Gaoshan (High Mountain) people.

    The Sui Dynasty, established at the end of the 6th century, unified the north and south divisions of Chinese history. In 607 AD, Emperor Yang of Sui sent Zhu Kuan and He Man to Taiwan to "seek out exotic customs." Three years later, he sent Chen Leng and Zhang Zhenzhou with a force of over ten thousand from Guangdong, via Gao Hua Island and ?? Island, to Taiwan. The "Book of Sui" records Taiwan's products and climate, stating that the local area "is suitable for rice, sorghum, millet, glutinous millet, hemp beans, red beans, broad beans, and black beans. The trees include maple, цаЭ, camphor, pine, цей, nanmu, fir, catalpa, bamboo, rattan, fruits, and medicinal herbs, similar to the Jiangbiao region. The climate and environment are similar to Lingnan." The Chinese people continued to engage in the development of Taiwan, accumulating rich production knowledge about the local area.

    Economic ties between Taiwan and the mainland, dating from the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, were generally uninterrupted. The Sun Wu, Eastern Jin, Song, Qi, and Liang dynasties all engaged in active maritime trade. Taiwan held a certain position in this extensive maritime trade. The "Book of Sui," in the biography of Chen Leng, mentions that when Chen Leng and his group first arrived in Taiwan, the local residents saw the ships and came to trade, indicating that Taiwan had a long-standing habit of commerce with the mainland. In Taipei, archaeologists discovered a type of palm-sized ancient brick belonging to the Three Kingdoms period. The "Book of Sui" says that the local custom was to "bathe the corpse and wrap it in cloth" after death. Early discoveries in Tainan include Tang and Song dynasty pottery bottles and ancient coins. These cloths and objects were naturally brought to Taiwan by Han Chinese.

    After the Southern Song Dynasty, the number of Han Chinese settling in Taiwan increased. In the early 12th century, the shift of China's political center from the Central Plains to the Jiangnan region objectively promoted the development of Taiwan. At the same time, as most areas of the mainland suffered years of war and social life was turbulent, residents from northern China also migrated to Taiwan. With the increase in the settled Han population, traffic between Taiwan and the mainland became more frequent. The Chinese government first implemented effective administrative management of Penghu, a crucial transportation hub. Zhao Rushi's "Zhu Fan Zhi" of the Southern Song Dynasty stated: "Quan (zhou) has an island called Penghu, which belongs to Jinjiang County." Wang Dayuan's "Dao Yi Zhi Lue" of the Yuan Dynasty and local chronicles of Quanzhou cited in Ming Dynasty notes also state that during the Southern Song Dynasty, Penghu was administered by Jinjiang County, and residents had disputes that were "resolved by Jinjiang County." This shows that at the latest from the 12th century, Penghu was formally administered by the Chinese government and became part of China's administrative territory.

    The Yuan Dynasty government established the Penghu Patrol and Inspection Office in the late 13th century. This marked the beginning of China's establishment of specialized administrative institutions on islands near Taiwan.

    From the mid-16th century onward, the ruling Ming Dynasty's power in China began to decline. Maritime incursions, which began in the Yuan Dynasty, now became a new external threat on China's borders. In addition to Japan, Western colonialists successively arrived in the East. Taiwan and certain ports on mainland China became targets for their seizure and plunder. The people of Taiwan and the mainland had to engage in various struggles to resist foreign aggression. After 1563, there were struggles against Japanese incursions into Taiwan; from 1603 to 1624, there were two struggles against the Dutch occupation of Penghu; from 1624 to 1661, there were struggles against the Dutch occupation of southern Taiwan; and from 1626 to 1642, there were struggles against the Spanish occupation of northern Taiwan. Among these, the struggle against the Dutch lasted the longest and was the most intense. The people of Taiwan and the mainland together achieved victory in each of these struggles.

    In that long and complex struggle, Han Chinese, centered around maritime civilian armed forces, established the earliest regime on the island of Taiwan. Zheng Zhilong, a native of Nan'an, Fujian, became the leader of Taiwan in 1625, resisting the Dutch aggression against Taiwan. The early Han-Chinese established regime in the Taiwan region resisted foreign aggression forces under different circumstances and promoted the development of local production.

    The Han Chinese population migrating to Taiwan increased rapidly during this time. From about 1624 to 1644, during the twenty years, about 25,000 households of Han Chinese people from Fujian and Guangdong went to Taiwan. In 1644, Taiwan had a Han Chinese population of about 30,000 households, totaling about 100,000 people. The large number of Han Chinese people migrating to Taiwan made a decisive contribution to the development of the area.

    Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga, Zheng Zhilong's son) entering Taiwan became a new starting point for the historical development of this region. From the beginning, he waged an active struggle against the Dutch aggressors who were entrenched in Taiwan and constantly plundering Fujian and Guangdong. Zheng Chenggong had high prestige among the people of Taiwan, who regarded him as their liberator. In 1661, Zheng Chenggong personally led a large army of 25,000 men into Taiwan to recover the area occupied by the Dutch. The Dutch colonial army struggled to resist, resulting in over 1,600 casualties, and surrendered to Zheng Chenggong in February 1662.

    Zheng Chenggong, on one hand, rectified the political system, trained soldiers, and eliminated the remaining forces of the aggressors; on the other hand, he encouraged agriculture, established schools, and devoted himself to economic development and cultural advancement. Zheng Chenggong died of illness in 1662, and his son Zheng Jing and grandson Zheng Keshuang continued to rule Taiwan for a total of twenty-three years. Zheng Chenggong is a famous patriotic hero in Chinese history, and he has always been revered by the Chinese people for expelling foreign aggressors in Taiwan.

    Of particular significance were the measures taken by the Zheng regime to improve agricultural production among the Gaoshan people and to develop the cultural life of the Gaoshan people. From the beginning, Zheng Chenggong earnestly protected the interests of the Gaoshan people. He treated the Gaoshan people and the Han Chinese completely equally. When the army reclaimed wasteland, the government issued strict prohibitions, "not allowing the encroachment of indigenous people and the property currently cultivated by the people." At this time, the Gaoshan people did not know about plowing with oxen, nor did they know how to use agricultural implements such as plows, hoes, hooks, and sickles. After the rice matured, they would pick each head individually. Yang Ying, an official of the Zheng regime, proposed that each Gaoshan village be issued a mature ox, a set of iron plows, and a set of iron harrows, and that experienced farmers be sent to each village to teach ox-plowing and the use of advanced agricultural implements. After some Gaoshan people accepted the production techniques of Han Chinese farmers, their lives improved. At the same time, in terms of culture, the Zheng regime also encouraged Gaoshan children to attend school and receive education. The cultural knowledge spread by the Han Chinese unprecedentedly raised the cultural living standards of the Gaoshan people.

    But Taiwan, after all, is a small area, and once it severed contact with the mainland, it was in a completely isolated position, which could not be sustained for long. In 1683, Taiwan returned to the unified regime of the Qing Dynasty.

    Taiwan, under the rule of a unified national regime, had a positive effect on the local and national economic and cultural development. Before the Opium War, it shielded Taiwan from external interference; and ensuring Taiwan also helped to stabilize the peaceful living environment of the coastal provinces. The unification of the Qing Dynasty promoted the rapid development of Taiwan's economy and culture. The people of Taiwan and the people of the whole country were closely related in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life, becoming an inseparable whole.

    Under the rule of the Qing government, a large amount of land in Taiwan was developed, handicrafts and commerce rose, and economic life showed a prosperous scene. According to statistics from 1811, the population of Taiwan had increased to 2,386,161 people. The vast majority of these increased population were working people who migrated from the mainland to Taiwan, mainly farmers. Han Chinese farmers and Gaoshan people were the direct producers of social wealth in the Taiwan region.

    The social life of the Gaoshan people now had further changes and development. Some Gaoshan people used plows and harrows to cultivate the land, similar to the Han Chinese. There were also ox carts among the production tools. There was primitive family handicraft industry, and women could weave wool cloth and linen cloth with wooden machines. According to statistics during the Yongzheng period (1723-1735), the Gaoshan people who paid poll tax to the Qing government every year included 59 large villages and more than 120 small villages. Each village had at least 40 to 50 male adults, and the most had 700 to 800 people. The political, economic, and cultural life of most Gaoshan villages were further linked with the Han Chinese.

    Britain launched the Opium War in 1840, and foreign capitalism began to invade China. Since then, in Chinese history, there has been a sharp struggle between the Chinese people's opposition to imperialism and feudalism, turning China into an independent and prosperous country, and imperialism and feudalism turning China into a colony. Taiwan has always occupied an important position in this life-and-death struggle between the two lines. Because, like other provinces in the southeast coast, it came into contact with foreign capitalist aggressors earlier, suffered deeper disasters directly, and the people have always been at the forefront of the struggle.

    During and after the Opium War, Britain, the United States, Japan, and France continuously launched armed aggression against Taiwan, overturning the Qing government's view of Taiwan as "trouble arises from within, rarely from outside." Especially after 1874, the military attacks of the United States, Japan, and France made the Qing government realize the importance of Taiwan in national defense and began to make the goal of governing Taiwan preventing aggressors from forcibly occupying Taiwan.

    After the end of the Sino-French War, Fujian Governor Liu Mingchuan suggested that the Qing government strengthen Taiwan's defense. In October 1885, the Qing government decided to establish Taiwan as a province, with Liu Mingchuan as governor, and established the provincial capital in Changhua. By the eve of the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, Taiwan Province had a total of three prefectures, one directly subordinate prefecture, six sub-prefectures, and eleven counties, totaling 3.2 million people.

    Before and after the establishment of the province, under the proposal of Shen Baozhen, Liu Mingchuan and others, many important measures were taken in national defense, industry, and cultural construction. From 1874, forts were built in Anping, Qi Hou, Keelung, Tamsui, and Penghu, new-style cannons were installed, and troops were stationed. After 1874, more than 1,500 miles of submarine and land electric lines were erected. In 1875, the Keelung coal mine was started to be mined with machines. From 1877, the railway from Taipei to Keelung and Taipei to Hsinchu was built successively, becoming one of the earliest railways in China. In 1877, a new school was established to teach mathematics, physics and chemistry, history and geography, surveying and mapping, and other subjects, and later a telegraph school was established. In 1885, a machine bureau was built, and in 1886, a cannonball manufacturing plant, a gunpowder bureau, and a mine camp were established. At this time, Taiwan was not only an important province in national defense, but also an advanced province in economy and culture.

    April 17, 1895, was a dark day in Taiwan's history. On this day, the Qing government, due to military defeats in the Sino-Japanese War, was forced to send the traitor Li Hongzhang as a representative, under the conspiracy, deception, and threats of the US government, to sign the humiliating Treaty of Shimonoseki with Japan. The Treaty of Shimonoseki stipulated that the Qing government ceded the entire island of Taiwan and all affiliated islands. From then on, the Japanese aggressors took this treaty as the basis for their forcible occupation of China's territory of Taiwan.

    At that time, a sharp opposition was formed between the people of the whole country and the Qing ruling group around the issue of ceding Taiwan. When the bad news of ceding Taiwan reached Taiwan, the compatriots in Taiwan "heard the roar of thunder in the middle of the night... Running around to tell each other, gathering to cry in the city, day and night, the cries reached the four fields" [1], showing unrestrained grief and indignation. The Taiwanese scholars who were taking the imperial examination in Beijing jointly wrote to the Censorate to fight for it. The gentry and people of the whole Taiwan sent telegrams directly to the Qing government, resolutely opposing the negotiation of peace by ceding land. The Qing government ignored them all. On the second day after the signing of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, Taipei City sounded gongs to close the market, angrily protesting the Qing government's treasonous crimes. The compatriots in the whole Taiwan were all determined to "live and die with the homeland." The masses "were willing to join the army to kill the bandits, and there were thousands of people every day" [2]. "All were prepared to fight the Japanese to the death, and were unwilling to cede the whole Taiwan to the Japanese. With the united will of the people, there was no second choice but to die" [3]. The people of the mainland also felt "heartache and despair, and there was no way to call for help" [4], and hated the Qing government's treason to the bone. At that time, the "Shen Bao", published in Shanghai, with the title "On the Righteous Indignation of the Taiwanese People, Which Is Enough to Shock Distant People", bluntly stated that "My ruler can be deceived, but my people cannot be deceived; my officials can be played with, but my people cannot be played with"! It clearly pointed out the fundamental difference between the people's line of resistance and the rulers' line of surrender. The voices of the broad masses of the people were also clearly reflected in the words of progressive intellectuals at that time. Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao and others launched the famous "Public Carriage Petition", opposing the cession of Taiwan and advocating the relocation of the capital to resist the war.

    Despite the Qing government's handover of Taiwan, the people have always resolutely resisted and unanimously supported Liu Yongfu, the defending general of Tainan, to lead the resistance against Japan. The people of Taiwan were not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice in order to defend the territory of the motherland, and fought against the Japanese invaders for five months without yielding in hundreds of battles. During this time, the Japanese invaders suffered a serious blow from the people of Taiwan, with a total of more than 32,300 killed and wounded, and nearly half of the main force of the invading army, the Konoe Division, was annihilated. This epic history of the Taiwanese people's resistance against Japan will not diminish its value because of the exhaustion of assistance and defeat.

    Until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, Japanese imperialism implemented fifty years of colonial rule in Taiwan Province of our country. Its main content was a brutal colonial rule order, which was a bone-marrow colonial exploitation. The heroic and unyielding people of Taiwan, in order to return to the embrace of the motherland, in order to oppose the oppression, extraction, and enslavement of the Japanese aggressors, carried out a tenacious struggle against the Japanese rule for a full half-century. During half a century, the armed uprisings against Japan held by the people in various parts of Taiwan almost never stopped for a single day. Among them, the most influential were the Taichung Uprising led by young worker Ke Tie in 1896, the uprisings led by Jian Dashi, Lu Yongchun and others in Taipei in 1899, the Beipu Uprising in 1907, the Lin Qipu Uprising and the Tuku Uprising in 1912, the Miaoli Uprising organized by Tongmenghui member Luo Fuxing in 1913, the Xilai'an Uprising in 1915, and the Wushe Uprising launched by Gaoshan compatriots in 1930. This fact shows the Chinese people's unwavering will to resolutely oppose aggression and demand liberation.

    The National Anti-Japanese National Liberation War broke out in 1937. On December 9, 1941, the Chinese government at that time officially declared war on Japan, stating that "all treaties, agreements, and contracts involving Sino-Japanese relations are hereby abolished." This statement was the result of a long-term struggle by the people of the whole country, including the people of Taiwan, fundamentally denying the Treaty of Shimonoseki and all unequal treaties between China and Japan, and resolutely demanding the recovery of Chinese territories such as Taiwan.

    Based on long-term and complete historical facts, the important international agreements during the Anti-Japanese War reaffirmed that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. The "Cairo Declaration" jointly signed by the governments of China, the United Kingdom, and the United States on December 1, 1943, stipulated that: "The purpose of the three countries is...to return to China the territories that Japan has stolen from China, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands." The "Potsdam Proclamation," jointly signed by China, the United Kingdom, and the United States on July 26, 1945, and later joined by the Soviet Union, once again stipulated that: "The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be implemented, and Japan's sovereignty shall be limited to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and other small islands as we determine."

    Japan was defeated and announced its unconditional surrender on August 14, 1945. On September 2, the Japanese representative signed the surrender document, and the first clause of the surrender document stipulated that Japan accepted "all the clauses in the Potsdam Proclamation." The Chinese government at that time held the Taiwan Province Surrender Ceremony at the Taipei Public Hall on October 25 of the same year. Hundreds of people, including the representative of US President Truman, attended the ceremony. Chen Yi, the chief Chinese surrender officer, delivered a radio address on the spot after the surrender: "From today on, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are formally returning to the territory of China, and all land, people, and political affairs have been placed under the sovereignty of the Chinese government. I hereby report this extremely historically significant fact to the compatriots of the whole country and the world." [5]

    Taiwan has returned to China; after 50 years of arduous struggle and the sacrifice of more than 500,000 lives, the people of Taiwan have finally shaken off the enslavement of Japanese imperialism and returned to the embrace of the motherland!

    After Taiwan returned to China, China carried out political and military management and restored its sovereignty over Taiwan. The Allied governments during the war against Japan also clearly recognized this fact in their subsequent statements. On January 5, 1950, US President Truman said in a statement on Taiwan: The purpose of the Cairo Declaration was "to return to China the territory seized by Japan from China, such as Taiwan. The United States is a signatory to the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945. The Potsdam Proclamation states that the terms of the Cairo Declaration should be implemented immediately. Japan also accepted the provisions of this declaration when it surrendered. ... Over the past four years, the United States and other allies have also recognized China's exercise of sovereignty over the island." [6] On February 9, 1950, the US State Department's public response to the US House Foreign Affairs Committee on the Taiwan issue stated that since the Japanese troops stationed in Taiwan surrendered to China, Taiwan has been administered by China. "It has been included in China and has become a province. ... The allies participating in the war against Japan did not question these steps. The US government did not question these steps either. Because these steps clearly complied with the promises made in Cairo and reaffirmed in Potsdam. In other words, the allies, including the United States, have considered Taiwan to be a part of China in the past four years." [7] On November 21, 1949, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mayhew said in the British House of Commons: "It was on the basis of the Cairo Declaration that the Chinese authorities took control of the island when Japan surrendered, and have since exercised control over the island." [8] On August 25, 1954, a British Foreign Office spokesman admitted: "The Cairo Declaration said that Taiwan should be returned to the Chinese government, and this has been done." [9]

    Taiwan returned to China, China restored its sovereignty over Taiwan, and the people of Taiwan achieved a complete victory in resisting the Japanese aggressors. From 1945, this important historical event has been written and highlighted in the glorious history of the modern Chinese people's resistance against foreign aggression.

    After the Kuomintang reactionary government took over Taiwan, the people of Taiwan did not get the free, equal, and happy living environment they dreamed of. Not long after Japan surrendered, the US imperialism, which had always harbored the ambition to invade Taiwan, quickly infiltrated Taiwan on a large scale from all aspects of politics, military, economy, and culture through its running dog, the Kuomintang traitor government. In a very short period of time, the United States controlled Taiwan's military bases and economic lifeline, and actually replaced Japan's rule in Taiwan. In 1946, the United States obtained the privilege to "freely operate various enterprises" in Taiwan through the "Sino-US Commercial Treaty." In 1948, the United States and the Jiang thief traitorous group signed a "Joint Development of Taiwan" agreement, massively plundering various important resources such as local petroleum, tungsten, aluminum, antimony, copper, gold, and sulfur, and some agricultural products. Under the cruel exploitation of the US and Jiang, the people of Taiwan lived an extremely impoverished life. The exorbitant taxes and levies imposed by the Jiang thief on the people amounted to more than 53 million yuan in counterfeit currency in 1949, and increased to more than 1.98 billion yuan in 1953, an increase of more than 36 times in four years. After the US imperialism and its running dogs were driven out of the mainland by the Chinese people in 1949, the United States tried to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. In June 1950, the United States launched a war of aggression against Korea, and after US President Truman issued a statement on armed intervention in Taiwan, the United States has been using armed force to protect its running dog Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to continue to occupy Taiwan.

    The heroic and unyielding people of Taiwan, after countless struggles against foreign aggressors in different historical periods, now have to make a final fight with the US imperialism and its running dogs, and the disasters they have suffered are extremely profound. However, the struggle of the people of Taiwan against the US imperialism and its running dogs will surely be victorious with the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. 1700 years of facts prove that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the people of Taiwan and the social life of Taiwan have always been inseparably linked with the people of the whole country and the social life of the whole country. At present, the people of the whole country are actively participating in the sacred struggle to liberate Taiwan. The rule of the US imperialism and its running dogs there cannot last for a long time. The Chinese people must complete the cause of unifying their motherland's territorial sovereignty, and the people of Taiwan must return to the embrace of the motherland. This is something that no force can stop and is bound to be realized!
