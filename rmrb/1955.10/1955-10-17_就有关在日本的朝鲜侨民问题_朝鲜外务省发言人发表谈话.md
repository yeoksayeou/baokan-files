Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement in Pyongyang on the 15th, saying: According to recent reports, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu stated that Japan would hold talks with the South Korean authorities, using the release of Japanese fishermen detained in South Korea as a "bargaining chip" to send Korean citizens detained in the Omura detention center in Japan to South Korea.

The spokesperson of the DPRK Foreign Ministry pointed out that Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's statement violates the principles and practices of international law regarding the legal status of citizens residing in foreign countries.

It is unfounded and impossible to resolve for the Japanese government to unilaterally discuss with the South Korean authorities any issues related to the interests of Korean citizens in Japan.

The spokesperson of the DPRK Foreign Ministry said that the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always been deeply concerned about the situation of Korean citizens residing in Japan and has consistently safeguarded their legitimate rights and interests.

We will completely not recognize any talks and measures unilaterally taken by the Japanese government with the South Korean authorities on this issue.

We emphasize that the Japanese government should immediately release the Korean citizens who are being unreasonably detained in Omura and other detention centers throughout Japan, and must stop the plan to send them to the South Korean authorities again against the will of the Korean citizens in the Omura detention center.

The spokesperson of the DPRK Foreign Ministry said that according to the materials obtained, the Korean citizens detained in Omura, Okayama, and other detention centers throughout Japan are in a miserable living situation, and their health is continuing to deteriorate.

The spokesperson of the DPRK Foreign Ministry finally said that we maintain that the Japanese government has the obligation, based on humanitarian grounds and international practice, to quickly improve the miserable situation of Korean citizens illegally detained in the Omura detention center. We also believe that it is necessary to send representatives of the Korean Red Cross to Japan in order to properly and satisfactorily resolve various issues concerning the living conditions and repatriation of Korean citizens, and we request the Japanese government to provide various conveniences for this.

    就有关在日本的朝鲜侨民问题
    朝鲜外务省发言人发表谈话
    新华社平壤十六日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人十五日在平壤发表谈话说：根据最近的报道，日本外务相重光葵声明说：日本将和南朝鲜当局举行会谈，以释放被扣留在南朝鲜的日本渔民为“交换条件”，把扣留在日本大村收容所的朝鲜公民遣送到南朝鲜。
    朝鲜外务省发言人指出，日本外务相重光的发言是违反国际法所公认的有关侨居外国的公民的法律地位的各项原则和惯例的。
    日本政府片面地同南朝鲜当局会谈任何有关在日本的朝鲜公民的利益问题，都是毫无根据的，也是不可能得到解决的。
    朝鲜外务省发言人说，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对于居住在日本的朝鲜公民的处境，经常予以深切的关怀，并且始终一贯地维护着他们的合法权益。
    我们将完全不承认日本政府就这个问题同南朝鲜当局片面进行的任何会谈和措施。
    我们强调：日本政府应当立即释放被无理扣留在大村和日本各地收容所的朝鲜公民，并且必须停止违反大村收容所的朝鲜公民的意愿、再度把他们送交南朝鲜当局的计划。
    朝鲜外务省发言人说，根据得到的材料，被扣留在大村和冈山以及日本各地收容所的朝鲜公民正处在悲惨的生活境况中，他们的健康状况正在继续恶化。
    朝鲜外务省发言人最后说，我们主张，日本政府有义务根据人道主义立场和国际惯例，迅速改善被非法扣留在大村收容所的朝鲜公民的悲惨处境。我们并且认为有必要派遣朝鲜红十字会代表前往日本，以便正当地、圆满地解决有关朝鲜公民的生活状况和回国的各项问题，同时要求日本政府对此给予各种便利。
