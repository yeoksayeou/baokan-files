    The Chinese Artists Association and the People's Fine Arts Publishing House are jointly holding the "Rong Bao Zhai Woodblock Watermark Painting Exhibition" at the Art Exhibition Hall from October 2nd, exhibiting more than 380 kinds of woodblock watermark paintings produced by Rong Bao Zhai.

    Woodblock watermark painting is one of the artistic creations of the working people of our country for more than a thousand years, and has a strong national style. Rong Bao Zhai's woodblock watermark paintings have a history of more than sixty years. Since the liberation, especially after being changed to state-owned, the output has greatly increased in quantity and the quality has also improved significantly.

    The exhibits are all carefully selected from Rong Bao Zhai's products since 1950, including New Year pictures, stationery, folk paper-cuts, ancient lacquerware patterns, Dunhuang murals, etc. The most exhibited and most eye-catching are reproductions of famous ancient and modern painters' works, such as Zhou Fang's "Hairpin Lady" of the Tang Dynasty, Qiu Ying's (Shi Zhou) and Lan Ying's (Tian Shu) landscapes of the Ming Dynasty, Wang Yun's (Han Zao) "Moonlit Pavilion" of the Qing Dynasty, Hua Yan's (Xin Luo Shan Ren) flowers and birds, Cai Jia's (Song Yuan) landscapes, Ren Yi's (Bo Nian) "Reed Duck Picture" and "Ren Bo Nian Album", Shen Zhou's (Shi Tian) "Shen Shi Tian Lying You Album", Yun Shouping's (Nan Tian) "Yun Nan Tian Flower Album", modern painter Xu Beihong's "Horse" and "Cat", Qi Baishi's "White Camellia" and "Qi Baishi Painting Collection", Chen Banding's flowers, etc., are all very finely engraved, accurately registered, and can use the characteristics of watercolor paints and woodblock printing to express the brushstrokes and color ink of the original work. The density of the water is like drawing directly on rice paper or silk with a brush.

    In order to make it easier for the audience to understand the printing method of woodblock watermark paintings, the exhibition also displays the working process of original drawing, engraving, and overprinting, as well as materials and tools. There is also a sales department in the exhibition hall to facilitate the audience to purchase the exhibited woodblock watermark paintings.

    中国美术家协会等  
    举办荣宝斋木版水印画展览
    中国美术家协会和人民美术出版社，从十月二日起在美术展览馆联合举办“荣宝斋木版水印画展览”，展出了荣宝斋出品的木版水印画三百八十多种。
    木版水印画是一千多年来我国劳动人民的艺术创造之一，具有浓厚的民族风格。荣宝斋的木版水印画，已有六十多年的历史，解放后特别是改为国营以来，出品在数量上已大大增加，在质量上也有显著提高。
    展览会展出的，都是从荣宝斋一九五○年以来的出品中精选出来的，有年画、笺谱、民间剪纸、古代漆器图案、敦煌壁画等，展出最多和最引人注意的是复制的古今著名画家的作品，如唐代周昉的“簪花仕女图”，明代仇英（十洲）、蓝瑛（田叔）的山水，清代王云（汉藻）的“月夜楼阁图”、华嵓（新罗山人）的花鸟、蔡嘉（松原）的山水、任颐（伯年）的“芦鸭图”和“任伯年画册”、沈周（石田）的“沈石田卧游册”、恽寿平（南田）的“恽南田花卉册”，现代画家徐悲鸿的“马”和“猫”、齐白石的“白茶花”和“齐白石画集”、陈半丁的花卉等，都刻得很精细，套印得很准确，而且能利用水彩颜料和木版印刷的特点，表现出原作的笔意和彩墨的浓淡水分，就像用毛笔直接在宣纸或绢上画出来的一样。
    展览会为了使观众易于了解木版水印画印制的方法，还陈列了从原画描稿、刻版和套印的工作过程以及材料、工具。在展览会场还设有售品部，便于观众选购展出的木版水印画。
