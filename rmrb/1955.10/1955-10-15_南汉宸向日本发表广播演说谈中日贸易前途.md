Xinhua News Agency, October 14th – Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, delivered a radio address to Japan from the Central People's Broadcasting Station on October 14th on the occasion of the opening of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition in Tokyo. The title of the address was: "The Development of Sino-Japanese Economic and Trade Relations Has Broad Prospects."

Nan Hanchen first talked about the Chinese Commodity Exhibition which is about to open in Tokyo. He said that this is a work that is beneficial to mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, and beneficial to the development of economic and trade exchanges between the two countries. He also expressed his heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade to the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, and many groups and people from all walks of life who have enthusiastically assisted in the exhibition.

Nan Hanchen said that the economic exchanges between China and Japan have a long and close history and have played an important role in the economic lives of the two countries. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, through the joint efforts of the people of the two countries, three Sino-Japanese trade agreements and accords have been signed successively, and the economic and trade exchanges between the two countries have been initially restored. However, because the Japanese government has followed the United States in implementing a discriminatory "embargo" policy against China, and China and Japan have not yet established normal relations, the implementation of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement is far from satisfactory, making it impossible to exchange many commodities that can be exchanged between China and Japan, thereby causing the Japanese economy to encounter many unnecessary difficulties.

Nan Hanchen said that there are many commodities that can be exchanged between China and Japan, and the two countries have full conditions for developing economic and trade exchanges. Commodities such as iron sand, coal, salt, soybeans, and rice needed by Japanese industry and people's lives, China used to supply in large quantities. In the future, with the development of China's industrial and agricultural production, the products that can be exported to Japan will continue to increase. At the same time, many commodities produced in Japan, such as steel, machinery, power generation equipment, ships, chemical raw materials, fertilizers, medicines, and rayon, are also needed by China. China is engaged in large-scale economic construction, and the market is huge and reliable. The machinery equipment and industrial raw materials that need to be imported are diverse. In the process of developing industry, foreign economic and trade relations will not be reduced but will increase day by day, and will be multifaceted. With the increasing purchasing power of the Chinese people, the import of daily necessities will also increase. The economic and trade relations between China and Japan have very broad prospects, which is not a fantasy but is based on facts.

Nan Hanchen said that Japan's import of coal, iron sand, soybeans, and rice from China is not only much cheaper, which is beneficial to the Japanese industrial and financial circles and the broad masses of the people, but also Japan's transportation industry can increase several million tons of transportation business every year. If the Japanese side can carry out economic and trade exchanges on the basis of independence, autonomy, equality and mutual benefit, in accordance with the needs and possibilities of both sides, Sino-Japanese trade can exceed the highest record in history, and this kind of trade is beneficial to the economic development and improvement of people's lives in both China and Japan.

Nan Hanchen expressed the hope that this exhibition will be able to comprehensively introduce China's traditional export goods and some new products of the past six years to the Japanese audience, so that the Japanese people can understand China's export commodities and the needs of imports in economic construction, so as to provide conditions for the development of economic and trade relations between China and Japan and for enhancing the friendship between the people of China and Japan.

Nan Hanchen finally said: The Chinese people have always had a sincere desire to enhance friendship and economic and trade exchanges with the Japanese people. The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, with the support and assistance of the Chinese government in recent years, has made unremitting efforts in this regard together with relevant units. I believe that with the joint efforts of the Japanese business community and people from other walks of life in the future, the normalization of economic and trade relations between China and Japan will be improved and developed day by day, and its prospects will be very broad.

    南汉宸向日本发表广播演说谈中日贸易前途
    新华社十四日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸为在日本举办中国商品展览会于十四日在中央人民广播电台向日本发表广播演说。题目是：“发展中日经济贸易关系有着广阔前途”。
    南汉宸首先谈到即将在东京开幕的中国商品展览会。他说，这是一项有利于中、日两国人民间相互了解和友谊的工作，有利于发展中、日两国间经济贸易往来的工作。他并且代表中国国际贸易促进委员会对日本国际贸易促进协会、日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟以及许多热心协助展出的团体和各界人士致衷心谢意。
    南汉宸说，中日两国间的经济往来有着悠久的密切的历史，在两国的经济生活中曾起着重要的作用。中华人民共和国成立以来，经过两国人民的共同努力，先后签订了三次中日贸易协议和协定，两国间的经济贸易往来有了初步的恢复。但由于日本政府追随美国，对中国执行了贸易歧视的“禁运”政策，中日两国还没有建立正常关系，所以中日贸易协议的执行是远远不能令人满意的，使中日两国间许多可以交换的商品不能交换，从而使得日本的经济遭遇到不应有的许多困难。
    南汉宸说，中日两国间可以相互交换的商品是很多的，两国间具有发展经济和贸易往来的充分条件，日本工业和人民生活中需要的铁砂、煤、盐、大豆、大米等商品，在过去，中国曾经大量供应过。今后，随着中国工农业生产的发展，可以输往日本的产品将会不断增加。同时，日本生产的许多钢铁、机器、发电设备、船只、化工原料、肥田料、药品和人造丝等商品也是中国所需要的。中国正从事于大规模的经济建设，市场是巨大和可靠的，需要进口的机器设备和工业原料是多种多样的。在发展工业的过程中，对外的经济贸易关系不是减少而将是日益增加的，并且是多方面的。随着中国人民购买力的日益提高，日用品的进口也将是增加的。中日两国之间的经济、贸易关系有着很广阔的前途，不是空想而是有事实根据的。
    南汉宸说，日本从中国进口煤、铁砂、大豆和大米等物品，不但成品便宜得多，对于日本工业界、金融界和广大人民有利，而且日本运输业每年还可增加数百万吨的运输业务。如果日本方面能在独立自主和平等互利的基础上，按照双方的需要与可能来进行经济贸易往来，中日贸易是可以超过历史上最高纪录的，而这种贸易对于中日两国经济的发展和人民生活的改善都是有益处的。
    南汉宸表示希望这次展览会能够概括地介绍中国传统的出口物资和六年来的一些新产品给日本各界观众，使日本人民了解中国的出口商品和在经济建设中进口的需要概况，为发展中日两国间的经济贸易关系，为增进中日两国人民的友谊提供条件。
    南汉宸最后说：中国人民一向具有同日本人民增进友谊与经济贸易往来的真诚愿望。中国国际贸易促进委员会近几年来在中国政府的赞助与支持下，在这方面曾和各有关单位共同作了不懈的努力。我相信今后在与日本工商界和其他各界人士的共同努力下，中日两国经济、贸易关系的正常化，是会日益改善与开展的，而其前途将是很广阔的。
