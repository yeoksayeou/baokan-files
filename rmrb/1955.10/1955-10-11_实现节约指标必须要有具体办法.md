    To Achieve Savings Targets, Concrete Measures Are Essential
    By our reporter Cao Baoming
    The 417 work section is a key unit of the Fourth Work Area of the Wuhan Fourth Construction Company. The entire section has more than five hundred employees, and they are currently constructing sixteen dormitories. The management work of this section was originally very chaotic. Employees only considered their own convenience in their work, arbitrarily misappropriated materials, and did not pay attention to retrieving them after use. Bricks, lumber, and nails were scattered all over the ground. In June and July alone, there were nearly sixty work-related injuries caused by nail punctures. Because people could take materials from this construction site at will, "as needed," the workers called this construction site a "communist warehouse."
    Starting in late June, this work section underwent a month-long anti-waste inspection, which made all employees deeply aware of the need to earnestly practice thrift. However, how should this work be carried out? Based on the past two years of experience in carrying out savings work in this work section, it was understood that if the savings targets proposed by the leadership were not specific, without clear sources of savings and savings measures, and workers did not understand how to complete the targets, the effect would be minimal. Moreover, the current projects, some of which had just started and some of which were nearing completion, were complex, and a mere general savings figure was even more unworkable.
    In order to make the overall savings plan concrete and provide workers with clear and specific targets, the Fourth Work Section, with the help of the company and the work area, strengthened its work in this area. At that time, the Fourth Construction Company analyzed the project settlement situation for the first three quarters and believed that newly started projects had a wide range of savings and great potential, not only saving a large amount of money but also saving a large proportion; for projects nearing completion, many expenses had already been paid, and the range of savings was relatively narrow. Therefore, savings targets had to be proposed separately according to the different progress of the projects in order to be realistic. Based on the calculation results, the company divided the unfinished projects into four categories: the first category, projects that were newly started or had only completed less than 20% of the project volume, should reduce costs by 5.78%; the second category, projects that had completed more than 20% but less than 60% of the workload, should reduce costs by 4.26% for the unfinished workload; the third category, projects that had completed more than 60% of the workload, should reduce costs by 2.97% for the unfinished workload; the fourth category, projects designed according to the new central standards, should reduce costs by 6.19%. The company also specifically instructed the construction site to further reduce consumption from the loss rate stipulated by the central government to save materials, and to comprehensively achieve the various labor quotas in Central and South China to increase labor productivity in order to achieve the purpose of reducing costs. The work section immediately followed the company's instructions, classified and calculated the material, labor, and expense accounts according to the specific situation of each unfinished project, clarifying that as long as the various labor quotas in Central and South China were fully achieved, labor productivity could be increased by 7.67% on the basis of the central budget quota. At the same time, they analyzed the loss rate of various materials at the construction site and studied various specific indicators for saving materials, which greatly enhanced their confidence in saving. With the help of the company and the work area, they also studied saving methods with veteran workers and broke down the savings targets more specifically according to the specific items of each uncompleted project (such as bricklaying, laying floor slabs, plastering walls, etc.), making it easier for workers to understand and grasp.
    The specific calculations resulted in the discovery of savings potential and specific methods. For example, the central government stipulates that the loss of red bricks is 3.5%. After deducting the loss from off-site transportation and inventory, the loss at the construction site is 1.3%. They require the loss rate to be reduced to 0.7%, that is, saving six bricks per thousand bricks. In addition, the 1954 quota was 1% higher than this year, so they jointly required saving sixteen bricks per thousand bricks. The saving method is to require all employees to cherish bricks, concentrate scattered bricks on the site at any time, not to misappropriate or break them casually, and not to treat half bricks as brick residue; require bricklayers to use half bricks for filling cores, embedding floor pillows, plugging eaves, and open ditches, etc., while ensuring the quality of the project. They analyzed thirteen major materials such as floor slabs, cement, and sand, and proposed savings targets and savings methods. When these indicators were specifically applied to the bricklaying project of the third building of type B, they first calculated that this project required more than 52,000 red bricks, more than 4,000 kilograms of cement, and more than 100 cubic meters of sand. Then, according to the savings targets, they calculated that bricklayers and mortar mixers were required to seriously implement savings measures to save more than 4,000 red bricks, 16 kilograms of cement, and more than 3 cubic meters of sand, saving a total of 256 yuan. They also required workers of all trades to universally promote advanced tools such as mortar spreaders, stone washers, and window installers, as well as advanced experiences such as segmented assembly line operations for roofs, which had been effective in the work section, in order to fully achieve and exceed the labor quotas in Central and South China. They also formulated measures to reduce engineering business expenses and management fees.
    As a result of formulating savings targets according to this classification and breakdown, the savings targets are more in line with the actual situation. This is welcomed by the employees, because in the past their savings targets were only a general percentage, and there was no source of savings or methods. The workers did not know how much they should save or where they should save from. Even the work section chief had to wait until the company made the project settlement before understanding the cost of the project. Therefore, the workers generally believed that saving was the leadership's business and had nothing to do with the workers. Some even said: "To save, then we can only not build so well (referring to reducing project quality); or simply not build." Now, they have specific savings targets for every project they do, with numbers and amounts, and it is clear that they are completing the targets by reducing material consumption and increasing labor productivity. They have a clear idea in their minds and are very energetic. During the discussion of the savings targets, the bricklaying team also proposed to save another five bricks per thousand bricks on the basis of saving sixteen bricks per thousand bricks. The specific method is: in the past, they treated the remaining quarter of the bricks as brick residue, and when making window sills, they broke the whole bricks into quarter bricks, which was a great waste. Now they concentrate the remaining quarter of the bricks to build window sills, saving whole bricks. The carpentry team proposed to save 2% of lumber when laying floor slabs. The method is: in the past, as long as the "tenon" of the prefabricated floor slab was slightly damaged, they would treat it as waste. Now they use these floor slabs to inlay floors, which can not only ensure the quality of the project—the floor slab does not leak ash—but also save wood. Because the targets are specific, all employees have set guarantee conditions, supervise each other, and take active action to complete the savings targets.
    In the past, they also established planning management systems such as "project task orders" and "quota material requisition orders," but the workers believed that the project had to be done well, done quickly, and the work was so "troublesome" that they were unwilling to implement them seriously, causing these systems to become formalities. Now, in order to truly achieve the goal of reducing costs, the work section has incorporated savings targets into the work plan. Before the start of each project, the work section issues "project task orders" and "quota material requisition orders," deducting the materials and labor that should be saved in advance. If overspending occurs during the work, the reasons must be investigated; the workers who have established a savings ideology also demand strict planning management. If the leaders do not issue "project task orders" and "quota material requisition orders," they will not start work. As a result, the work section from top to bottom attaches importance to and improves planning management work. They originally needed ten days to inspect a project, but now they have changed to inspecting and settling each project item as soon as it is completed. Some construction workers who used to dislike planning as troublesome now say: "I have to lead with the task order and the material requisition order." This is an important guarantee for completing the project plan and the savings plan.
    In the past, the work section leaders clearly knew that there was a lot of waste at the construction site, but they did not know how much waste there was or what the cause of the waste was until the company made the project settlement, but by that time the project had been completed and there was no way to remedy it. The Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau once required the company to conduct economic activity analysis, but the company did not know where to start. Now, in the implementation of various savings targets, the quotas for materials, labor, and expenses can be gradually made to conform to the actual situation, creating conditions for formulating advanced quotas. At the same time, through the completion of savings targets, weak links can be identified and ways to improve them can be studied. In the first two weeks of August, their savings targets for plastering walls were not met, so the work section immediately conducted an inspection and found that the main reason was that the surface of the inner walls was uneven and the thickness of the plaster was uneven, so they promptly found a way to correct it. They also learned that the potential for saving wood was great and could be further saved.
    The 417 work section began to implement various savings targets on August 1st. In August, they overfulfilled the planned workload by 100.03%. In the past, each worker could only produce about 20 yuan per work day. In August, the plan was to increase it to 22.23 yuan, but the actual completion was 22.63 yuan, and labor productivity also increased by 1.71% compared to the plan. In the first two weeks of August, their material saving plan was 461 yuan, and the actual completion was 733 yuan, completing 156% of the saving plan. Among them, the floor slab plan was to save 1%, but the actual saving was 3.5%.

    实现节约指标必须要有具体办法
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    四一七工段是武汉市第四工程公司第四工区的重点单位。全段有五百多个职工，现在正在修建十六栋宿舍。这个工段原来的管理工作很混乱。职工们在工作中只图自己方便，随意挪用材料，用后也不注意收回，砖头、木料、钉子丢得遍地都是。六、七两月份被钉子刺伤脚的工伤事故就有近六十起。因为人们可以在这个工地随意拿材料，“各取所需”，所以工人们就叫这个工地是“共产主义仓库”。
    从六月下旬起，这个工段经过了一个月的反浪费检查，使全体职工都深切地感到必须认真厉行节约。但是，如何开展这一工作呢！根据这个工段过去两年开展节约工作的体会，知道如果领导上提出的节约指标不具体，没有明确的节约来源和节约措施，工人不了解怎样去完成指标，效果是不大的。而现时的工程有的刚开工，有的快收尾，情况复杂，仅仅一个笼统的节约数字，更无法行得通。
    为了把全面节约的计划具体化、给工人提出明确而具体的指标，第四工段在公司和工区的帮助下，加强了这方面的工作。当时，第四工程公司曾分析了前三个季度的工程决算情况，认为新开工工程节约的范围宽、潜力大，不仅节约的金额多，而且节约比例也大；快收尾的工程许多费用多已开支，节约的范围就比较窄，因此节约的指标必须按工程不同进度来分类提出，才能切合实际情况。公司根据计算的结果，把未完工程分了四类：第一类，新开工或只完成了工程量百分之二十以下的工程，应降低成本百分之五点七八；第二类，完成工作量百分之二十以上、百分之六十以下的工程，未完工作量应降低成本百分之四点二六；第三类，完成工作量百分之六十以上的工程，未完工作量应降低成本百分之二点九七；第四类，按中央新标准设计的工程，应降低成本百分之六点一九。公司又具体指示工地，应从中央规定的损耗率中进一步降低损耗来节约材料，要从全面达到中南各项劳动定额来提高劳动生产率，以达到降低成本的目的。工段立即根据公司的指示，按照他们每栋未完工程的情况分类计算了材料、人工、费用三笔账，明确了只要全面达到中南各项劳动定额，便能在中央预算定额的基础上提高劳动生产率百分之七点六七，同时分析了工地各项材料的损耗率，研究出节约材料的各项具体指标，大大增强了节约的信心。他们又在公司、工区帮助下，同老工人研究节约办法，并按各项没有完成的工程的具体项目（如砌墙、铺楼板、粉刷墙面等），把节约指标分解得更具体，使工人容易了解和掌握。
    具体计算的结果，找到了节约的潜力和具体方法。举例来说，中央规定红砖的损耗为百分之三点五，扣除场外运输和库存损失外，工地的损耗为百分之一点三，他们要求把损耗率降为百分之零点七，即每千块砖节约六块，再加上一九五四年定额比今年高百分之一，他们共要求每千块砖节约十六块。节约的办法是要求全体职工爱护砖块，随时把零散的砖头集中现场，不随便挪用或打碎，不把半头砖当砖渣处理；要求泥工在保证工程质量的条件下，把半头砖用于填心、嵌楼枕、塞檐、明沟等工程上。他们对楼板、水泥、砂子等十三项主要材料作了分析，提出了节约指标和节约办法。把这些指标具体应用到乙式第三栋的砌墙工程上时，他们首先算出这个工程共需用五万二千多块红砖、四千多公斤水泥、一百多方砂子，然后按照节约指标加以计算，要求泥工和合灰工认真贯彻节约措施，节约四千多块红砖、十六公斤水泥和三方多砂子，共节约二百五十六元。他们还要求各工种工人普遍推行已在工段行之有效的铺灰器、洗石器、装窗器等先进工具和屋面分段流水作业等先进经验，以求全面达到和超过中南劳动定额。他们还订出降低工程业务费和管理费的办法。
    按照这种分类、分项制定节约指标的结果，使节约指标比较符合实际情况。受到职工们的欢迎，因为过去他们的节约指标仅是一个笼统的百分比，也没有节约的来源和办法，工人们不知道自己应该节约多少、也不知道应该从什么地方节约，甚至工段长都得等公司作出工程决算后才了解工程成本高低。因此，工人们普遍认为节约是领导的事，同工人无关。有的还说：“要节约，那就只有不修这么好（指降低工程质量）；或者干脆不修。”现在，他们作哪一个工程项目都有具体的节约目标，有数目、有金额，并且明确了是从降低材料损耗和提高劳动生产率来完成指标，心中有数，劲头很大。在讨论节约指标时，泥工小组还提出要在每千块砖节约十六块的基础上，再节约五块，具体办法是：过去他们都把剩下四分之一的砖头当做砖渣处理，而作窗台时又把整砖打成四分之一的砖头，浪费很大，现在就把剩下四分之一的砖头集中用来砌窗台，节约整砖。木工小组提出在铺楼板时，要节约木料百分之二，办法是：过去只要预制楼板的“子口”稍有损坏，他们就当做废品处理，现在要把这些楼板用来镶地板，既能保证工程质量——楼板不漏灰，又能节约木材。由于指标具体，全体职工都订出了保证条件，互相监督，为完成节约指标积极行动起来。
    过去，他们也曾经建立过“工程任务单”、“限额领料单”等计划管理制度，但工人们认为工程又要作得好，作得快，工作还这么“麻烦”，不愿认真执行，致使这些制度流于形式。现在，为了真正达到降低成本的目的，工段把节约指标纳入了作业计划。在每项工程开工前，工段就签发“工程任务单”、“限额领料单”等，事先把应该节约的材料、人工扣除，工作中如果发生超支现象，就要追查原因；树立了节约思想的工人对计划管理也要求严格，如果领导上不签发“工程任务单”、“限额领料单”等，他们就不开工。这样一来，工段从上到下都重视和改进计划管理工作。他们原来要十天才验收一次工程，现在已改为每个工程项目随完工随验收、结算。一些过去嫌计划麻烦的施工员，现在都说：“我得凭任务单和领料单才能领导。”这是完成工程计划和节约计划的重要保证。
    过去，工段领导人员明明知道工地浪费很大，但究竟浪费多少，浪费原因何在，要等公司作出工程决算后才知道，但到那时工程已经完了，就没法补救。市建筑工程局曾要求公司进行经济活动分析，公司也不知该从何着手。现在，在贯彻各项节约指标中，就能使材料、人工、费用的定额逐步切合实际，为制定先进定额创造条件，同时通过节约指标完成情况，就能找出薄弱环节，研究改进办法。八月上中两旬，他们粉刷墙面的节约指标没有完成，工段就立即进行检查，查出主要是内墙毛面凹凸不平、粉灰厚度不匀，便及时找出了改正的办法。他们同时还了解到节约木料的潜力大，可以进一步节约。
    四一七工段是从八月一日开始贯彻各项节约指标的。他们八月份超额完成计划工作量百分之一百点零三。他们过去每个工人每个工日只能生产二十元左右，八月份计划提高为二十二点二三元，实际完成二十二点六三元，劳动生产率也比计划提高了百分之一点七一。八月上中两旬，他们的材料节约计划是四百六十一元，实际完成七百三十三元，完成节约计划百分之一百五十六，其中楼板计划是节约百分之一，实际上节约了百分之三点五。
