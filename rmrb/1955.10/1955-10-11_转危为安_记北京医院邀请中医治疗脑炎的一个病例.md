Turning Danger into Safety
——A Case of Beijing Hospital Inviting Traditional Chinese Medicine to Treat Encephalitis
Beijing Hospital Internal Medicine Doctor Zeng Zhaoqi

On August 29th of this year, a seriously ill patient was lying in a ward of Beijing Hospital. This was a Soviet expert in his forties. He came to the hospital on August 26th because he felt headaches and fever. When he first entered the hospital, his body temperature was around 38 degrees Celsius. Physical and neurological examinations proved to be basically normal, except that the blood test showed a slight increase in white blood cells. After being admitted to the hospital, the patient had fever and severe headaches, and also experienced vomiting, which led to the suspicion of a nervous system problem. A lumbar puncture was performed, revealing high intracranial pressure and an increased number of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, most of which were old red blood cells, while the chemical composition was normal. At that time, doctors thought it might be hemorrhagic encephalitis after a cold and epidemic Japanese encephalitis. He was immediately injected with penicillin, streptomycin, urotropine, and glucose. The next morning, the patient's headache was still very severe, and he was restless, loved to sleep, and his neck was slightly stiff. In the afternoon, his consciousness became somewhat unclear, and he could not answer questions correctly. Another lumbar puncture was performed at this time, revealing even higher intracranial pressure. The number of cells in the cerebrospinal fluid was still high, mainly white blood cells, reaching as high as 400+, while other chemical components were normal. Therefore, the doctor diagnosed encephalitis. After consultation with Chinese and Soviet experts, the patient began taking aureomycin and undergoing plasma therapy. However, on the third day, the condition continued to deteriorate, with higher fever, loss of consciousness, wild movements, delirium, convulsions, incontinence, hyperesthesia, neck stiffness, and right hemiplegia. On the fourth day, the patient's body temperature rose above 40 degrees Celsius, breathing was very rapid, more than 40 times per minute, and occasionally stopped for a moment, with a rattling sound in the throat. This type of breathing is called "Cheyne-Stokes respiration" in medicine, which indicates that the patient's respiratory center has been damaged and the condition is dangerous.

For this patient with epidemic Japanese encephalitis, Chinese and Soviet experts from the internal medicine and neurology departments inside and outside the hospital conducted multiple consultations. All effective treatments for encephalitis were exhausted, but the condition did not improve at all. In the end, they relied only on continuously supplying oxygen and injecting various cardiotonics such as camphor, coriamyrtin, coramine, and caffeine to prolong life.

At this critical juncture, the hospital leadership still actively sought ways to save him. They heard that traditional Chinese medicine in Shijiazhuang and other places had achieved significant results in treating epidemic Japanese encephalitis, so they immediately requested the Ministry of Health to send traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to treat him. The leaders of the Ministry of Health attached great importance to this and immediately sent Dr. Wei Longxiang and Dr. Gong Zhixian from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Department of the Ministry and Dr. Zhao Xiwu from the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine to the hospital for diagnosis. They also telegraphed Dr. Qian Letian, an experienced traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from another region, to come and assist overnight.

After consultation, the traditional Chinese medicine doctors believed that the patient's current symptoms belonged to "summer-heat febrile disease" in traditional Chinese medicine, and prescribed a decoction based on "Baihu Tang" (White Tiger Decoction) and "Yinqiao San" (Honeysuckle and Forsythia Powder), along with drugs such as "Ju Fang Zhi Bao Dan" (Treasured Pill from the Bureau of Formulas). The patient took the first dose of traditional Chinese medicine at 11:30 pm on the 29th, and then took it every two hours. The body temperature began to drop that night, falling to 37.6 degrees Celsius the next morning. However, the patient was still comatose, convulsing, and the pulse was uneven. The traditional Chinese medicine doctors believed that the condition was still serious and prescribed a second prescription, still based on "Baihu Tang," adding whole scorpion and centipede, which have significant effects in treating convulsions, and also added "Angong Niuhuang San" (Calm the Palace Bezoar Pill). In the afternoon, the patient's body temperature rose again to 39.3 degrees Celsius, there was still a lot of phlegm in the throat, and the convulsions had not stopped. Therefore, a third prescription was given based on the condition, with the main method being the same as before, and adding drugs to resolve phlegm and treat hemiplegia. After that, the patient's body temperature gradually dropped to a normal temperature, convulsions decreased, breathing became regular, phlegm decreased, white blood cells gradually decreased, and lymphocytes gradually increased. These phenomena all proved that the patient had begun to improve.

On the third day after taking traditional Chinese medicine—the morning of September 1st—the patient, who had been in a coma for five days, gradually regained consciousness, opened his eyes, could also turn his head, and could speak simply and answer others' questions. After that, the patient got better day by day.

During the treatment process, all important decisions were made after mutual research between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, demonstrating the close unity of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Although there were some different opinions during the consultation process, they were finally unified. For example, when it was found that there were more rales in the patient's lungs, Western medicine doctors were afraid of complications of pneumonia and suggested continuing to use penicillin and streptomycin. Traditional Chinese medicine doctors were afraid of conflicts between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine and advocated stopping the use, instead using traditional Chinese medicine with antibacterial effects. Finally, everyone considered that these drugs had been used together for several days during the treatment process and there were no adverse reactions, so they agreed to use them. Another example is that for this kind of patient with high fever and weakness, Western medicine doctors paid great attention to the supply of nutrition; while traditional Chinese medicine doctors believed that the patient's various physiological functions were weakened under such circumstances, and the ability to digest and absorb was extremely weak. Forcing chicken soup, meat soup, and other oily foods would increase the patient's burden. They advocated giving the patient juice pressed from several fresh fruits and fresh herbs, which is a light, palatable, nutritious, and easily digestible food, and also a cooling and antipyretic medicine, called "Wuzhi Yin" (Five-Juice Beverage). Western medicine doctors thought it was very good. In addition, during the course of the disease, in order to observe the condition, Western medicine doctors proposed to draw blood, perform lumbar puncture, and take X-rays. Traditional Chinese medicine doctors believed that it was not appropriate to do too much during a critical illness to prevent damage to the vital energy, and Western medicine doctors agreed.

From the entire process of the disease, it can be seen very clearly that before the traditional Chinese medicine treatment, the condition was worsening day by day, until it reached the most dangerous point; while as soon as the traditional Chinese medicine treatment began, the disease began to improve significantly. However, some people raised questions such as: Was the diagnosis correct? Were the conditions for Western medicine treatment good? Would the patient have improved without traditional Chinese medicine treatment? The answer is: Beijing Hospital is relatively good in terms of equipment conditions, technical conditions, and medical style. Regarding this case, the time of onset was during the epidemic season of encephalitis. The patient's symptoms, such as fever, headache, coma, convulsions, and increased white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, with normal chemical composition, were all completely consistent with encephalitis phenomena; currently, serological diagnosis has also confirmed epidemic Japanese encephalitis. After being admitted to the hospital, the treatment and nursing were correct and timely. There were no mistakes or shortcomings. However, the condition still developed to such a serious degree. This shows that if it were not for the traditional Chinese medicine treatment, the patient's consequences would have been disastrous. This is exactly what Professor Huagelarike, a Soviet expert in internal medicine at Beijing Hospital, concluded about this case. He said, "This is a seriously ill patient who was in life-threatening danger, and now there has been a very obvious improvement, and this turning point is due to the result of traditional Chinese medicine treatment." He said, "In the future, we should trust traditional Chinese medicine more and should give them very good conditions so that they can treat early, and not wait until the patient is very critically ill before looking for traditional Chinese medicine."

Some people think that one case is not enough to illustrate the problem, which is also incorrect. As far as I know, this year, traditional Chinese medicine in Shijiazhuang City treated 20 patients with epidemic Japanese encephalitis, more than half of whom were extremely severe, with a cure rate of 90%. This fact shows that this case is by no means isolated, but one of many encephalitis cases treated by traditional Chinese medicine in various epidemic areas across the country over the years.

Some people have seen the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in treating epidemic Japanese encephalitis, but they always feel that there is no theoretical basis, so they are unwilling to admit it. For example, someone said: "Baihu Tang" (White Tiger Decoction) is mainly gypsum (i.e., calcium sulfate), and the solubility of gypsum in water is very small, so how can it be effective?" It should be pointed out that the pharmacological properties of traditional Chinese medicine for treating encephalitis have not yet been satisfactorily answered. In order to fully answer this question, research work is needed, and this is precisely the responsibility that all medical workers across the country, especially Western medicine practitioners, cannot shirk. Therefore, we must correct our attitude towards the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, resolutely criticize bourgeois ideology, and earnestly learn traditional Chinese medicine. This requires not only studying traditional Chinese medicine books, but also cooperating with traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in treating patients, confirming its efficacy through clinical practice, and then using the scientific and technological knowledge we have already mastered to conduct in-depth research, summarize experience, and further improve it. These tasks are quite arduous and complex, so let us dedicate our strength to this great cause!

    转危为安
    ——记北京医院邀请中医治疗脑炎的一个病例
    北京医院内科医生　曾昭耆
    今年八月二十九日，在北京医院的病房里，躺着一个病情严重的病人。这是一个四十多岁的男同志，苏联专家。他是在八月二十六日因为感到头疼和发烧而来医院的。刚进医院时，体温三十八度上下，体格、神经系统经过检查证明基本正常，只是在血液化验时，发现白血球稍微增高。入院之后，病人除发烧和剧烈头痛外，并曾经发生呕吐，因而怀疑他有神经系统的毛病。经作了一次腰椎穿刺，发现脑压高，脑脊液里细胞增多，其中大部分是陈旧的红血球，化学成分正常。那时，医生们认为可能是感冒后的出血性脑炎和流行性乙型脑炎。当时就给他注射了青霉素、链霉素、乌罗托平和葡萄糖。第二天上午，病人头痛还是很厉害，并且不安静，爱睡觉，颈子稍有点发硬。下午，神志就有点不清楚，不能正确地回答问题。这时又作了一次腰椎穿刺，发现脑压更高了，脑脊液中细胞仍多，其中主要是白血球，已高达四百多个，其他化学成分正常。于是医生诊断为脑炎。经中苏专家会诊，开始给病人服用土霉素，并施行血浆疗法。但是，第三天病情继续恶化，体温更高，并有神志昏迷、乱动、说胡话、抽风、大小便失禁、知觉过敏、颈部僵直和右半身麻痹等现象。第四天，病人体温升高到四十度以上，呼吸非常急促，每分钟四十几次，并且时而停止片刻，痰在喉咙里呼噜呼噜地响。这种呼吸在医学上叫作“潮式呼吸”，它说明病人呼吸中枢已受到损害，病情危险。
    对这位流行性乙型脑炎病患者，院内院外的内科和神经科的中苏专家进行了多次会诊，一切对脑炎有效的治疗办法都用尽了，而病情并没有丝毫的好转。最后只依靠不断地供给氧气和注射各种强心剂如樟脑、山梗菜素、可拉明、咖啡因等，来延续生命。
    在这万分危急的关头，医院领导方面仍积极设法来挽救他。他们听到石家庄等地中医治疗流行性乙型脑炎已经有了显著成效，就立即向卫生部请求派中医前来治疗。卫生部领导方面对此非常重视，立即派了该部中医司的魏龙骧大夫、龚智贤大夫和中医研究院的赵锡武大夫来院诊视，并即电请外地治疗脑炎有经验的中医钱乐天大夫连夜赶来协助。
    中医大夫会诊后，认为患者目前病症属于祖国医学中的“暑瘟病”，并对症拟出以“白虎汤”、“银翘散”为主的汤药处方，同时加了“局方至宝丹”等药物。病人在二十九日晚上十一时半服了第一次中药，以后每二小时服一次。当夜体温就开始下降，第二天早上降到三十七点六度。但病人还是昏迷、抽风、脉搏不均匀。中医大夫认为病情仍重，又开了第二次处方，仍以“白虎汤”为主，加入对治疗抽风有显著效果的全蝎和蜈蚣，并加了“安宫牛黄散”。下午，病人体温又上升到三十九点三度，喉咙里仍然有很多痰，抽风还没停止。于是又根据病情给了第三次处方，主要方法同前，并加上了化痰治偏瘫的药。此后，病人体温逐渐下降到正常的温度，抽风少了，呼吸也规则了，痰也少了，白血球逐渐下降，淋巴球逐渐升高。这些现象都证明，病人已经开始好转。
    在服中药后的第三天——九月一日上午，已经昏迷了五天的病人逐渐清醒，眼睛睁开了，头也可以转动了，并且能够简单地说话和回答别人对他的询问。此后，病人一天天地好起来。
    在治疗过程中，各种重要的处理都是经过中西医互相研究以后进行的，表现了中西医的紧密团结。尽管在协商过程中大家曾有过一些不同的看法，但最后都统一了起来。例如：当发现病人肺部出现较多的水泡音时，西医大夫深怕会并发肺炎，建议继续使用青霉素和链霉素。中医大夫则怕中药和西药发生冲突，主张停止使用，而用有抗生作用的中药。最后大家又考虑到在治疗过程中，这些药物已共同使用了几天，并无不良反应，结果同意使用。又如对这种高烧和衰弱的病人，西医大夫极注意营养的供给；而中医大夫则认为病人在这种情况下，各种生理功能减退，消化和吸收能力极弱，强加鸡汤肉汤等含油多的食物，反而增加病人负担，主张给病人服用由几种鲜果和鲜草药压出来的汁水，这是一种清淡可口，营养丰富，容易消化的食物，又是一种清凉解热的药物，名叫“五汁饮”。西医大夫认为很好。此外，在病程中，为了观察病情，西医大夫提出希望抽血、作腰椎穿刺及照爱克斯光，中医大夫认为在病情危重时不宜多作，以防伤害元气，西医大夫也就同意了。
    从病情的整个过程可以非常清楚地看到：在中医治疗之前，病情是逐日加重的，以至达到最危险的地步；而中医治疗一开始，病势就随着有了显著的好转。但是，有人却提出这样的疑问：诊断是否正确？西医治疗条件是否良好？不用中医治疗，病人是否也会好转？回答是：北京医院在设备条件、技术条件和医疗作风方面都是比较好的。就这个病例而论，病人发病的时间，正是脑炎的流行季节。病人的症状如发烧、头痛、昏迷、抽搐以及脑脊液中白血球增高，化学成分正常等，都完全符合于脑炎现象；目前，血清学诊断也已证实为流行性乙型脑炎。入院后，治疗和护理是正确的、及时的。没有任何差错和不到之处。但是，病情仍发展到如此严重的地步。由此说明，如果不是中医的治疗，病人的后果是不堪设想的。这正如北京医院内科苏联专家华格拉里克教授对这个病例所作的结论所说的，他说：“这是一个曾经危及生命的重病患者，现在已经有了极其明显的好转，而这个转折点是由于中医治疗的结果。”他说：“今后应该更多地信任中医，应该给予很好的条件，使他们能早期治疗，不要等到病人已十分危重时才找中医。”
    有人认为一个病例不足以说明问题，这也是不对的。据我所知，今年石家庄市中医治疗了二十个流行性乙型脑炎病人，其中极重型的在半数以上，治愈率达百分之九十。这一事实说明，这个病例决不是孤立的，而是若干年来中医在全国各流行区内治疗许多脑炎病例中的一个。
    有人虽然看到了中医治疗流行性乙型脑炎的疗效，但总觉得没有理论根据，所以还不愿意承认。如有人说：“‘白虎汤’主要是石膏（即硫酸钙），石膏在水中的溶解度是很小的，怎么会有疗效呢？”应该指出：中药对于治疗脑炎的药理性能，直到现在还没有人作出满意的回答。为了完满地回答这一问题，就须要进行研究工作，而这恰恰是我们全国医务工作者，特别是西医不可推卸的责任。因此，必须端正对待祖国医学遗产的态度，坚决地批判资产阶级思想，认真地学习祖国医学。这不仅须要学习中医书籍，而且须要协同中医治疗病人，通过临床实践，肯定其疗效，然后运用自己已经掌握的科学技术进行深入研究，总结经验，进一步地加以提高。这些工作是相当艰巨和复杂的，让我们为这伟大的事业而献出自己的力量吧！
