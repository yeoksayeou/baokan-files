At the banquet, Ulanhu delivered a welcoming speech. He said: The arrival of visiting delegations of various fraternal nationalities in the capital of the motherland – Beijing, and their visits to various places, demonstrate the increasingly consolidated and strengthened close unity of all nationalities in our country. Our country is advancing along the socialist road, and every nationality living in the great family of the motherland has a bright and splendid future of development. With the development of the socialist construction cause of the motherland, the construction undertakings of all fraternal nationalities will also receive greater development. He hoped that everyone would take the opportunity of their visit to learn well from the Han people and other fraternal nationalities, so as to better serve their own nationalities and the motherland.

They unanimously expressed their gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government for their care and concern, and expressed their determination to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Lhalu Tsewang Dorje said: Since the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni came to Beijing last year to participate in the first session of the First National People's Congress and formulated the Constitution, the unity of all nationalities in the motherland has been further strengthened. In the short few years since liberation, thanks to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the strong assistance of the Central People's Government, Tibet has achieved great success in all aspects of construction, especially the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, which has brought happiness to the Tibetan people. In order to achieve greater achievements in the various constructions of the motherland and Tibet, the Tibet Region Visiting Delegation must study hard during this visit.

Also present at tonight's banquet were the heads of the Dalai Lama's Office in Beijing, the Panchen's Office in Beijing, and the Central Institute for Nationalities.
