To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China:

Dear Comrades,

On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, on behalf of all the working people of Germany, extends its heartfelt wishes and fraternal congratulations to the Communist Party of China and the great and heroic Chinese people. Under the leadership of the long-tested Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have achieved a historic victory in the people's revolution, overthrown the forces of foreign imperialism, comprador bourgeoisie, and feudal landlords, established a people's democratic order, and created the prerequisites for building socialism. The great achievements of the Chinese people and their unwavering struggle for peace have decisively changed the balance of world forces in favor of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and have promoted the easing of international tensions. The German Socialist Unity Party and the working people of the German Democratic Republic deeply feel the close connection with the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. They wish the People's Republic of China, as a great socialist power, further achievements in realizing its first Five-Year Plan and in the struggle to safeguard peace in Asia.
Long live the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Germany.
Long live the long-tested Communist Party of China and the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.
Long live the invincible doctrine of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.
The Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party
