Genius Violin and Piano Performers
    ——On the Performances of Soviet Musicians Sobolevsky and Merzhanov
    Ma Sicong, President of the Central Conservatory of Music

Each time Soviet artists come to China for performance tours, they leave us with an unforgettable impression. Each time, they bring much inspiration to our artists and enable us to learn a lot.

The Soviet artists visiting China this time have also brought us great joy with their wonderful performances. Here, I will only talk about the performances of violinist R. N. Sobolevsky and pianist V. K. Merzhanov, although I sincerely praise the performances of other artists as well.

The Soviet violin and piano schools have a glorious tradition. The Soviet Union has produced the world's most outstanding violinists and pianists. They have made outstanding contributions to violin and piano playing techniques. Soviet music education, having absorbed the good experiences of predecessors and added new content, has become more scientifically accurate and more efficient in training students. Many newly emerging Soviet performers have mastered advanced techniques at a young age, and their performances often reach a flawless level.

The performance of the young Soviet violinist Sobolevsky is a case in point. He showed us the superb technique and moving expressiveness of violin playing. Sobolevsky's bowing is bold and powerful, each bow stroke appears so firm, controlled, and full of boldness. The tone is broad and powerful, youthful, optimistic, and bright. I don’t need to talk much about his infallible left hand (because that's superfluous). In the three pieces he played, there were many technically difficult parts, but he played them as if it were effortless. At such a high speed, moving nimbly up and down on the four strings, he actually achieved an almost machine-like absolute accuracy. But this does not mean that a performer only needs to master technical proficiency. On the contrary, mastering technique well is for removing the obstacles that technical difficulties present to the performer's interpretation of the music. Because the performer's ultimate goal is the full and profound expression of the music, excellent performers can make people forget the instrument itself and present the content of the music in the most direct and simple way.

Sobolevsky's performance, because he mastered all the most difficult techniques on the instrument, allows him to express his thoughts and feelings at will. His playing style is youthful, enthusiastic, bold, and lyrical. All three pieces he played were very complete. His interpretation of Khachaturian's "Poem" with its legendary lyrical style was full of beautiful, mythical fantasy; for Tchaikovsky's cheerful and lively "Scherzo-Valse" (although from my personal preference, I felt it might have been played a little too fast); and finally, for Brahms' "Hungarian Dance," with its magnificence and power, I cannot favor one over the other, because all three pieces were played appropriately and movingly. Violinists like Sobolevsky should be ranked among the most outstanding. Pianist Ye. N. Kalinkovichskaya's accompaniment was not only very consistent with the violin performance, but also revealed her talent in piano playing.

The excellent pianist Merzhanov attracted me greatly from the beautiful and strong tone he produced as soon as he placed his fingers on the keyboard. First of all, his most correct key-pressing method gave him a resonant, clear, and elastic tone, like singing. His playing style is complete, and can be said to be classical. When he played Chopin's "Prelude No. 24," the image of revolutionary troops waving flags seemed to appear. Even in such a highly romantic piece, the performer did not use overly exaggerated techniques to express it; everything was just right, what should shine shone, and what should sing sang. In his complete mastery of advanced techniques, the music moved people deeply as it should. In pieces like Scriabin's "Etude," the chords sometimes emerged from softness or darkness; at other times they resembled a bold ensemble of instruments. The handling of the escalating levels of the music was very convincing. What was most exciting was the handling of Tchaikovsky's "Sleigh Ride" (i.e., "Troika" on the program), the joyful mood of the people riding in the sleigh was very realistically portrayed. When the lovely melody was in the left hand, the sixteenth notes in the right hand danced happily. Merzhanov finally played Prokofiev's "March," this humorous march excited the audience with its pushing and shoving rhythm.

The Soviet piano and violin schools are worth learning from. In the Soviet Union, great piano masters emerge in large numbers, now everyone knows the names of Oborin, Gilels, Richter... and rising stars are constantly appearing. This is worthy of our admiration. And young musicians are well cultivated, giving full play to everyone's talents, which is not only the pride of the Soviet people, but also a great encouragement to us.

    天才的提琴和钢琴演奏家
    ——记苏联索波列夫斯基和麦尔热诺夫的表演
    中央音乐学院院长马思聪
    每次苏联艺术家来到我国进行访问演出，都给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。每一次，他们都给我们的艺术工作者带来许多启发，使我们学习到很多东西。
    这次来我国访问的苏联艺术家们，同样以他们的精采的演出，带给了我们极大的喜悦。这里，我只谈谈小提琴家鲁·纳·索波列夫斯基和钢琴家维·克·麦尔热诺夫的演出，虽然其他艺术家们的演出也使我衷心赞许。
    苏联的提琴和钢琴学派，是有着光辉的传统的。苏联产生了世界上最优秀的提琴家和钢琴家。他们在提琴和钢琴的演奏法上作出了卓越的贡献。苏联的音乐教学，由于吸取了前人的好的经验，并增加了新的内容，因而在训练学生上，更加有了科学的准确性，更加提高了效率，苏联许多新起的演奏家们，都是在年纪轻轻的时候就掌握了高度的技巧，他们的演奏常常能达到无懈可击的境界。
    苏联的年青的小提琴家索波列夫斯基的演奏，就是一个例证。他使我们看到了提琴演奏的高超的技术和动人的表现力。索波列夫斯基的弓法是大刀阔斧的，每一弓都显得那样坚定，操纵自如，充满了豪气。音色是广阔而有力、年青、乐观而明朗的。我更不必多谈他那百发百中的左手了（因为这是多余的了）。在他所演奏的三首乐曲中，有许多技术艰深的部分，但他演奏起来，好像并不费力似的。他在那样高的速度下，在四根弦上，上下灵活地动作着，其实是达到了一种近乎机器的绝对准确性。但这绝不是说一个演奏家只要能够掌握技术的高度熟练就可以了，恰好相反，很好地掌握技术是为着能解除技术的困难所给予演奏家对乐曲表演中的障碍。因为演奏家最终的目的正是对于乐曲的充分的深刻的表现，优秀的演奏家能够令人忘记乐器的本身，能够把乐曲的内容最直接最单纯地呈显出来。
    索波列夫斯基的演奏，由于他掌握了一切乐器上最艰深的技术，因此他就能随心所欲地去表达思想感情。他的演奏风格，是年青热烈、豪放而又抒情的。他所演奏的三首乐曲，都是非常完整的，他对于哈恰都良的“长诗歌”的传奇式的抒情风格，充满着美丽的神话般的幻想；对于柴可夫斯基的愉快活泼的“谐谑圆舞曲”（虽然从我个人的爱好，感觉到演奏得可能太快一点），和最后对于勃拉姆斯的“匈牙利舞曲”的壮丽、强劲，我都不能有所偏爱，因为三个乐曲都演奏得很恰当，很动人。像索波列夫斯基这样的提琴家是应该列在最杰出的行列的。钢琴家叶·纳·卡林科维茨卡雅的伴奏不仅和提琴的演出非常一致，同时也显露了她在钢琴演奏上的才华。
    卓越的钢琴家麦尔热诺夫，从他开始将手指按在键盘上所发出的美丽的强健的音色，就给我以很大的吸引。首先他的最正确的按键方法，使他具备了一种洪亮清彻、同时富有弹性、如像歌唱一样的音色。他的演奏风格，是一种完整的、可以说是古典的风格。当他演奏萧邦的“第二十四首前奏曲”时，好像革命的队伍挥动着旗帜的形象，就在这样高度浪漫主义的乐曲中，演奏者也没有用过份夸张的手法去表现，一切是恰到好处，该闪耀的闪耀出来了；该歌唱的也歌唱出来了。在他完整的高度技术的掌握中，音乐以其应有的深入激动人心。在像斯克列宾的“习作曲”中，和弦时而从柔和或阴暗出现；时而又像豪爽的乐器在合奏着。对于乐曲的高涨的层次是处理得很有说服力的。最令人感到兴奋的就是对柴可夫斯基的“雪撬”（即节目单上的
  “三套马车”）的处理，乐曲中那种赶雪撬的人们的愉快心情很真实地被刻划出来了。当那可爱的旋律在左手时，那右手的十六分音符高兴地在跳动着。麦尔热诺夫最后演奏了普罗柯菲耶夫的“进行曲”，这个幽默的进行曲，以其前推后拥的节奏激动着听众。
    苏联的钢琴学派和提琴学派都是值得我们学习的。在苏联，伟大的钢琴大师辈出，现在谁都知道奥波林、纪来斯、里克德尔……这些名字，而后起之秀也正在不断出现。这是值得我们钦羡的。而年青的音乐家们都受到良好的培养，充分地发挥了每个人的才华，这不单是苏联人民的骄傲，对于我们也是莫大的鼓舞。
