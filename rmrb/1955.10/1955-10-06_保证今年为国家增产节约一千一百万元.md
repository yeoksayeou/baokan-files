To the Editors:

We, all the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, would like to report our production situation to the people of the whole country through you.

Our production tasks for September were higher than any month this year and the production plan for the same month in the past five years. Encouraged by the First Five-Year Plan, we overcame all difficulties and created new achievements in production.

In the first few days of September, due to unfavorable blast furnace conditions, pig iron production fell short by more than 900 tons. At this time, the workers of all workshops mobilized to support ironmaking production. The workers of the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office completed the repair work of two small hot blast stoves 113 hours ahead of schedule, enabling the hot blast stoves to be put into production six days in advance; the transportation department supplied railway cars for loading raw materials in a timely manner; the ironmaking workers launched a labor competition in the form of internal linkage within the workshop, and the blast furnace workers adopted a series of technical measures such as furnace washing and stabilizing the charging system to stabilize the furnace conditions. With everyone's concerted efforts, the furnace conditions gradually improved, and pig iron production increased day by day. By September 26, pig iron production had exceeded the plan by 177 tons, including 62 tons of ferromanganese. We were not satisfied with these achievements. In late September, the workers of a certain blast furnace revised the competition targets, raising the original target of guaranteeing an excess production of 200 tons of pig iron to 600 tons; the workers of a certain blast furnace, after reversing the phenomenon of cost overruns at the beginning of the month, proposed a plan to reduce costs by 50,000 yuan and overproduce 200 tons of pig iron (including 80 tons of ferromanganese).

On the eve of National Day, new records continued to appear in our production. The workers of the cast pipe yard produced a maximum of 129 more pipes per shift than originally planned. Wang Liqian, an old sand-turning worker in his fifties, increased his work efficiency by 50%. Lathe operators Zhang Xin and Xu Jihua doubled their work efficiency; the quality fully met the standards. On September 26 and 27, the factory had already completed the September state plan for five products ahead of schedule; the plans for other products will also be completed on schedule or ahead of schedule. At present, according to the nine products proposed by the four workshops of ironmaking, coking, casting, and crude benzene refining in our factory, the excess production value in September will reach more than 270,000 yuan.

In the future, we must also conscientiously implement the instructions in the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' letter to workers across the country, overcome formalism in labor competitions, conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, continuously improve the level of production, ensure the over-fulfillment of this year's plan, and increase production and save 11 million yuan for the country.

### 保证今年为国家增产节约一千一百万元

    保证今年为国家增产节约一千一百万元编辑同志：
    我们石景山钢铁厂的全体职工，愿意通过你们向全国人民报告我们的生产情况。
    我们九月份的生产任务，比今年任何一个月和过去五年来同月的生产计划都要高。我们在第一个五年计划鼓舞下，克服了一切困难，在生产中创造了新的成绩。
    九月份的最初几天，因为高炉炉况不顺利，生铁产量亏产到九百多吨。这时候，各车间的职工们都动员起来支援炼铁生产。总机械师室的工人们提前一百一十三个小时完成了两座小热风炉的修理工作，使热风炉提前六天投入了生产；运输部门及时供应装原料的车皮；炼铁工人们开展了车间内部的联动机形式的劳动竞赛，高炉工人采取了洗炉、稳定装料制度等一系列的技术措施来稳定炉况。在大家一致努力下，炉况逐渐好转了，生铁产量日益上升，到九月二十六日生铁已超产一百七十七吨，其中锰铁超产六十二吨。我们并没有满足于这些成绩，在九月下旬，某号高炉全体工人修改了竞赛指标，把原来保证超产二百吨生铁的指标提高到六百吨；某号高炉的工人们在扭转了月初成本超支的现象以后，又提出降低成本五万元、超产生铁二百吨（其中锰铁八十吨）的计划。
    在国庆节的前夕，我们的生产中不断出现新的纪录。铸管场的工人最高一班曾比原计划多生产了一百二十九根管子。五十多岁的老翻砂工人王立铅提高工作效率百分之五十。车工张鑫和许继华提高工作效率一倍；质量完全合乎标准。在九月二十六日和二十七日，全厂已经有五种产品提前完成了九月份的国家计划；其它产品的计划也一定能够按期或提前完成。目前，根据我厂炼铁、炼焦、铸造、粗苯精制四个车间提出的九种产品，九月份超产价值就达到二十七万多元。
    今后，我们还一定要认真贯彻中华全国总工会告全国职工书中的指示，克服劳动竞赛中的形式主义，认真学习苏联先进经验，不断地提高生产水平，保证超额完成今年计划，并给国家增产节约一千一百万元。
                    石景山钢铁厂全体职工
