To the Editor:

I am writing to you to report on a serious problem in the highway transportation work in Liaoning Province.

Some factories and mining enterprises in Liaoning Province overemphasize self-transportation and are unwilling to use vehicles from state-owned transportation units, blindly increasing the number of trucks they own. According to statistics, in the past two and a half years in the Lüda Municipality, the number of trucks owned by enterprises increased from 394 to 602. The Dalian Chemical Plant purchased 18 new vehicles in two years. Some units already have enough vehicles, but they continue to buy more.

This practice not only results in an excess of vehicles, preventing them from fully utilizing their transportation capacity, but also causes confusion in highway transportation work because many units use surplus vehicles to compete for freight sources everywhere. For example, the Dalian Port Authority, Warehouse Storage and Transportation Company, Municipal Industrial Bureau, Municipal Commercial Bureau, Railway Business Office, Construction Engineering Company, Dalian Steel Plant, and other units in Lüda Municipality all set their own freight rates and rules, openly engaging in transportation business. The external business volume of Dalian Steel Plant's vehicles accounts for 57 percent of its total transportation volume, and the external business volume of the Lüda Municipality Canned Food General Factory's vehicles accounts for as much as 70 percent. The Shenyang Municipal Commercial Bureau, Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, and other units also engage in transportation business. In addition to transporting its own goods, the Shenyang Hardware and Electrical Equipment Company has also signed a transportation contract with the Shenyang Flour Mill, handling 3,000 tons of goods per month. Some units, in order to make use of their own vehicles, even resort to various illegal means to compete with transportation companies for freight sources. For example, the Dalian Port Authority uses the method of prohibiting loading and unloading workers from other units from entering the port to force shippers who transfer goods through the port to rent vehicles from the Port Authority. The Shenyang Municipal Industrial Bureau stipulates that freight rates will be reduced by 10 percent compared to the transportation department's freight rate standards. In order to win the transportation of 2,000 tons of coal from the Coal and Building Materials Company, the Lüda Municipality Supply and Marketing Cooperative even changed the 18-kilometer transportation distance to be calculated as 13 kilometers.

Under these circumstances, the local transportation departments cannot control the freight sources, cannot complete the transportation plan, and cannot reasonably adjust the local transportation capacity. According to my understanding, the highway transportation units in Liaoning Province failed to complete their tasks for several consecutive months in the first half of this year due to the above reasons.

This chaotic situation in highway transportation work should attract the attention of transportation management departments and relevant enterprises. I suggest that the relevant transportation departments conduct thorough research on the local transportation capacity and freight volume, implement unified management of the self-owned trucks of various enterprises, and give full play to the transportation efficiency of existing vehicles.

### 辽宁省不少单位盲目购置运货汽车造成浪费

    辽宁省不少单位盲目购置运货汽车造成浪费编辑同志：
    我向你们反映目前辽宁省公路运输工作中的一个严重问题。
    辽宁省有些厂矿企业过分强调自货自运，不愿意利用国营运输单位的车辆，而盲目增添运货汽车。据统计，旅大市在最近两年半中，企业自用货车就由三百九十四辆增加到六百零二辆。大连化学厂在两年中购买了十八辆新车。有些单位的汽车本来已经够用，但还在继续买。
    这种做法，不但使汽车超过需要，不能充分发挥运输能力；并且还因为不少单位用多余的汽车到处争揽货源，造成了公路运输工作中的混乱现象。例如，旅大市的大连港务局、仓库储运公司、市工业局、市商业局、铁路营业所、建筑工程公司、大连钢厂等单位，都自订运价和章则制度，公然办理运输业务。大连钢厂的汽车对外营业量占总运输量的百分之五十七，旅大市罐头食品总厂的汽车对外营业量竟占总运输量的百分之七十。沈阳市商业局、市建筑工程局等单位也都办理运输业务。沈阳五金器材公司的汽车除运输自己的货物外，还和沈阳制粉厂签订了运输合同，每月揽运三千吨货物。有些单位为了使自己的汽车得到利用，更采取各种非法的手段和运输公司争夺货源。如大连港务局利用禁止其它单位装卸工人入港的办法，迫使经港口转运货物的货主只能租用港务局的汽车。沈阳市工业局规定运价一律比运输部门运价标准降低百分之十。旅大市供销合作社为了争揽煤建公司的二千吨煤的运输，竟然把十八公里的运距改按十三公里计费。
    在这种情况下，当地的运输部门就掌握不住货源，无法完成运输计划，也不能合理地调剂当地的运输力量。据我了解，今年上半年辽宁省公路运输单位因为上述原因竟连续好几个月完不成任务。
    公路运输工作中的这种混乱现象，应该引起交通管理部门和有关企业单位的注意。我建议有关交通部门切实研究当地运力、运量的情况，对各企业单位的自用货车实行统一管理，充分发挥现有汽车的运输效能。          钟子明
