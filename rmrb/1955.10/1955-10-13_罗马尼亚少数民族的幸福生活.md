    The Happy Life of Ethnic Minorities in Romania
    Romania Dá Mǐkèluòshí

    In the Romanian People's Republic, living together with the Romanians, who constitute the majority of the residents, are approximately 2.4 million people from various ethnic minorities.

    Among these ethnic minorities, the largest group is the Magyar (Hungarian) ethnic group. Next are the German, Serbian, Ukrainian, Jewish, Lipovan, Tatar, and Turkish ethnic groups. Their residential areas are distributed throughout the country. In the past, the lives of ethnic minorities were very difficult. They suffered from double oppression—exploitation by the bourgeoisie and landlords, and national oppression. The bourgeois government, supported by fascists, implemented cruel rule over ethnic minorities, primarily characterized by Magyar-chauvinism and anti-Semitism. The purpose of this policy was to conceal the essence of exploiting the people, to provoke ethnic relations, in order to weaken the unity of the working people at home and their strength in the struggle against reactionary rule.

    The cruel rule of the bourgeoisie and landlords can be evidenced by the following facts: the reactionary government forcibly implemented more than 400 laws and decrees that placed ethnic minorities in a humiliating position, with their various rights greatly restricted and violated. At that time, people of ethnic minorities were not allowed to hold civil service positions and were prohibited from teaching in their native languages. Only a small portion of ethnic minorities were allowed to enter Romanian schools. Due to the so-called "Romanian Naturalization Law," thousands of workers and staff were driven into the streets.

    After our country was liberated by the Soviet army, the people seized power, and the lives of ethnic minorities also underwent fundamental changes. The Romanian Workers' Party, adhering to the principles of internationalism and the Leninist-Stalinist national policy, resolutely abolished the policy of national oppression, declaring that ethnic minorities and Romanians enjoy equal rights, in order to realize the great ideal of brotherly friendship among all nationalities. The Party's principles quickly became reality. Today, national equality has been confirmed by the Constitution of the Romanian People's Republic and has become the policy of the state.

    The establishment of the Magyar Autonomous Region is a brilliant embodiment of the national policy of the Romanian People's Republic. This autonomous region is located in the central part of our country, in the Mureș River basin in the western part of the Eastern Carpathian Mountains. Its area is equivalent to one-tenth of the country's territory, with a total of 600,000 residents, of which 500,000 are Magyars.

    In the past, the residents here lived in extreme poverty. The Romanian nationalist government oppressed the Magyar people and showed them no concern. Because the rich underground resources and power resources were not developed and utilized, this area became one of the most backward regions in old Romania. There were only two factories and a few sawmills here, and most of the residents were herdsmen or cultivators of barren land. In this plateau area, grains were difficult to grow, and there were only a few orchards.

    Although the Magyar people are hardworking and capable, they still could not get regular food and clothing. Every autumn, many people had to wander all over the country to find work that could only earn a few lei (Romanian currency). Some who could not endure the suffering emigrated abroad to make a living. But under the rule of the capitalist system, happiness could not be found anywhere.

    Only after liberation did their lives undergo fundamental changes. Today, in the friendly and united family of all nationalities in the Romanian People's Republic, all phenomena of racial discrimination and national oppression have been eliminated. In the Magyar Autonomous Region, administrative affairs in all aspects such as justice, public security, and economic life are managed by the Magyar working people themselves. The prevalence of the native language has greatly promoted the unity between the masses and the government. The administrative organs of the autonomous region also try their best to take care of the characteristics, needs, and customs of other ethnic groups living here. A new and unbreakable friendly relationship between all ethnic groups has been established here.

    An even more obvious fact is that the administrative center, Târgu Mureș, is rapidly developing. This city, which used to be a winter resort for nobles and landlords, is gradually transforming into an industrial area. The largest furniture factory in Southeastern Europe, which can produce a complete set of bedroom furniture every three to four minutes, has been established in Târgu Mureș. The entire production process of this factory is mechanized. Part of its products are also exported abroad.

    The Ensel Nor factory, which assembles and repairs textile machinery, was also established during the years of the People's regime. It completed the Five-Year Plan six months ahead of schedule as early as June this year. Thirty-one enterprises in Szekler County have completed their production plans ahead of schedule. A modern milk powder factory has been established in the Hungarian Autonomous Region, providing the working people here with high-quality dairy products for the first time. Other factories have also been developed during the years of the People's regime; these include the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej Textile Factory, the Andrei Bârseanu Sugar Factory in Târgu Mureș, and the Sándor Petőfi Factory, which produces high-quality tanned leather products. These facts clearly demonstrate that, with the care and support of the state, the Magyar Autonomous Region has also embarked on the road of socialist industrialization. Modern industry has increased employment opportunities for the residents here, and their products have also improved the living standards of the people in the region.

    The Magyar Autonomous Region has also made great progress in agriculture. The laboring peasants have realized the benefits of being organized, and many have joined agricultural production cooperatives. The harvests of collective farms such as Udvárfalva, Corois-Spădaca, and Acățari have reached high records. Members of the collective farms have built new houses and clubs for themselves. At the same time, the government also provides large-scale assistance to individual producers in the form of seed selection, loans, and so on. Kozma Károly, an individual farmer, has won a government medal for his work achievements.

    With the development of industry and agriculture, the Magyar Autonomous Region is carrying out a widespread cultural revolution. Before liberation, there were a total of 60,000 illiterate people here, but now they have disappeared. A dense cultural network with hundreds of libraries and cinemas, theaters, and more than two thousand art groups has been established here. An extremely important cultural facility is the Târgu Mureș Medical-Pharmaceutical Institute, which recently celebrated its tenth anniversary. The institute has well-equipped ear, nose, and throat, pediatric, neurological and other departments. Fifty-seven percent of the students enjoy scholarships, and they can not only get free room and board but also receive monthly allowances from the state. Students in the institute study in their native language. Among the famous professors working here are Dr. Dezső Miskolczy, who has achieved remarkable results in the study of Pavlov's theory, Dr. Magay, who has performed 75,000 operations, Dr. Vince Vándai, who has studied sleep for many years, and many others. In addition to this institute, there are more than 800 schools of all levels in the Magyar Autonomous Region, where students study in their native language while also learning and understanding the national language.

    The Szekler National Theatre here has become famous throughout the country, with several national prize winners and meritorious artists, such as Gheorghe Kovács and Ernő Szabó. Since the establishment of the theater, more than 1.3 million audiences have enjoyed Romanian, Soviet, and Hungarian dramas here.

    The Magyar-language newspaper "Red Flag" and the literary monthly "Truth," whose contributors include outstanding Magyar writers and poets, many of whom are national prize winners, are also published in the autonomous region.

    The sculptor István Gyárfás, who enjoys a high reputation both at home and abroad, lives and works in Târgu Mureș. He won the World Peace Council's Gold Medal for his woodcut "Korean."

    We could cite more achievements made by our region in recent years, but the above examples are powerful enough to show that the Romanian Workers' Party's national policy has guaranteed the all-round development of ethnic minorities in the country. As our economic and cultural undertakings continue to advance, the friendship between the Romanian people and other ethnic minority peoples is also constantly consolidating. They are fighting shoulder to shoulder for the victory of building socialism and striving for peace.

    罗马尼亚少数民族的幸福生活
    罗马尼亚  达·米克洛什
    在罗马尼亚人民共和国，同占居民大多数的罗马尼亚人生活在一起的，还有为数约二百四十万人的各个少数民族。
    这些少数民族中人数最多的是马扎尔族。其次是日耳曼族、塞尔维亚族、乌克兰族、犹太族、利普凡族、鞑靼族和土耳其族。他们的居住区分布在全国各地。在过去，少数民族的生活是十分艰苦的。他们受到双重的压迫——资产阶级地主的剥削和民族的压迫。被法西斯支持的资产阶级政府对少数民族实行了残酷统治，其主要特征是反对马扎尔族的沙文主义和反犹太主义。这种政策的目的是想掩盖剥削人民的本质，挑拨民族关系，以便削弱国内劳动人民的团结和反对反动统治的斗争力量。
    资产阶级地主的残酷统治，可以从下列事实得到证明：反动政府强迫实行了四百多项法律和法令，使少数民族处于屈辱的地位，各项权利受到了极大的限制和侵犯。在那时候，少数民族的人是不许担任文官职务的，并且被禁止用本民族的语言教学。只有一小部分的少数民族才被允许进入罗马尼亚学校。由于所谓“罗马尼亚归化法”，数千名工人和职员被驱逐到街头。
    我国由苏联军队解放后，人民掌握了政权，少数民族的生活也起了根本的变化。罗马尼亚工人党遵循着国际主义和列宁斯大林民族政策的原则，坚决地废弃了民族压迫的政策，宣布少数民族和罗马尼亚人享有平等权利，以实现各民族兄弟友好的伟大理想。党的原则很快地就变成现实。今天，民族平等已经为罗马尼亚人民共和国宪法所确认，并且成为国家的政策。
    马扎尔族自治区的成立，是罗马尼亚人民共和国民族政策的光辉体现。这个自治区位于我国中部，在东喀尔巴阡山脉西部的穆列希河流域，它的面积相当于全国领土的十分之一，共有六十万居民，其中五十万为马扎尔族。
    在过去，这里的居民生活在极端贫苦之中。罗马尼亚的民族主义政府压迫马扎尔族人民，对他们没有丝毫的关心。由于丰富的地下资源和动力资源没有得到开发和利用，这里就成为旧罗马尼亚最落后的地区之一。这里只有两个工厂和几个锯木场，大部居民都是牧民或贫瘠土地的耕种者。在这个高原地区，谷物难以成长，只有很少几个果园。
    虽然马扎尔族的人民是勤劳而能干的，但是仍然不能得到经常的温饱。每逢秋天的时候，许多人不得不流浪到全国各地去寻找只能赚取几个列伊（罗币）的工作。而一些忍受不住困苦的人则移居到国外去谋生。但是在资本主义制度的统治下，任何地方都是找不到幸福的。
    只有在解放以后，他们的生活才起了根本的变化。今天在罗马尼亚人民共和国的各民族友好团结的大家庭里，一切种族歧视和民族压迫的现象都已消除了。在马扎尔族自治区里，司法、治安和经济生活等各方面的行政事务，都是由马扎尔族劳动人民自己管理的。本民族语言的通行，大大地促进了广大群众和政府的团结。自治区的行政机构也尽量照顾到居住在这里的其他民族的特点、需要和风俗习惯。各民族间的牢不可破的新的友好关系，已经在这里建立起来了。
    更明显的一个事实，就是这里的行政中心塔尔古·摩列苏城正在迅速地发展着。从前作为贵族和地主的冬季疗养地的这个城市，逐渐变成为工业区。东南欧最大的、每三四分钟就可以出产一整套卧室用具的家具工厂，已经在塔尔古·摩列苏建立起来了。这个工厂的全部生产过程都是机械化的。它的一部分产品还输出到国外去。
    装配和修理纺织机器的恩塞尔·诺尔工厂也在人民政权的年代创建起来。它早在今年六月间就提前半年完成了五年计划。赛克勒县已有三十一个企业提前完成了生产计划。一个现代化的奶粉工厂已在匈牙利族自治区建立起来了，它第一次供给这里的劳动人民以上等的奶制品。其他工厂在人民政权年代里也得到发展；其中包括乔治乌—德治纺织工厂、塔尔古·摩列苏的安德列·伯拿特制糖厂和生产上等鞣皮制品的山陀尔·裴多菲工厂。这些事实清楚地说明，在国家的关怀和支持下，马扎尔族自治区也已经走上了社会主义工业化的道路。现代化的工业为这里的居民增加了就业的机会，它们的产品也提高了本地区人民的生活水平。
    马扎尔族自治区在农业方面也有很大的进展。劳动农民已经体会到了组织起来的好处，许多人都参加了农业生产合作社。乌德瓦尔伐瓦、科若斯帕达克和阿科斯伐尔瓦等集体农庄的收获量已经达到了高度的纪录。集体农庄庄员们已为自己盖起了新的房舍和俱乐部。同时，政府还以选种、贷款等形式大规模地帮助个体生产者。科兹玛·卡若里——一个个体农民，因为自己的劳动成绩而获得了政府的奖章。
    随着工农业的发展，马扎尔族自治区正在实行着广泛的文化革命。解放前，这里共有六万个文盲，现在已经绝迹了。一个拥有数百个图书馆和电影院、戏院以及两千多个艺术团体的稠密的文化网已在这里建立起来了。一项极重要的文化设施，就是最近才庆祝了它的建校十周年的塔尔古·摩列苏医学——制药学院。学院里有设备完善的耳、鼻、喉科，小儿科，神经科和其他科系。百分之五十七的学生享有助学金，他们不仅可以免费食宿，并且还可以每月从国家得到津贴。学院里的学生是用本民族语言学习的。在这里工作着的有名教授包括在巴甫洛夫学说研究上获有显著成就的德索·米斯科基博士，施行过大小七万五千次手术的马加斯博士，多年来研究睡梦的文斯·温代博士和其他许多人。除了这个学院之外，在马扎尔族自治区还有八百多个各级学校，学生们用本族语言学习着，同时也学习和通晓着国语。
    这里的赛克勒国家剧院已经闻名全国，它拥有几个国家奖金获得者和功勋艺术家，如格奥尔基·科瓦斯和尔诺·沙波等人。自从剧院建立以来，共有一百三十多万观众已在这里欣赏过了罗马尼亚的、苏联的和匈牙利的戏剧。
    在自治区还出版着马扎尔文的报纸“红旗”和文学月刊“实话”，“实话”的投稿者中包括卓越的马扎尔族作家和诗人，他们有很多人都是国家奖金获得者。
    在国内外享有盛名的雕刻家伊斯特万·乔瓦西就在塔尔古·摩列苏生活和工作着。他因自己的木刻作品“朝鲜人”而获得世界和平理事会的金质奖章。
    我们还可以举出我国这一地区这些年来所获得的更多成就，但是以上的例子已经足够有力地说明：罗马尼亚工人党的民族政策已保证了国内各少数民族的多方面的发展。在我们的经济和文化事业不断前进的同时，罗马尼亚人民和其他少数民族人民间的友谊也在不断巩固着。他们正在肩并肩地为建设社会主义和争取和平的胜利而斗争。
