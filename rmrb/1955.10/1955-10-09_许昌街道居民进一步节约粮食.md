    Residents of Xuchang Streets Further Conserve Grain
    After the implementation of the grain rationing system in Xuchang City, Henan Province, residents of the streets, under the leadership of the CCP branch and the street government, held symposiums to exchange experiences in saving grain and further conserve grain. Zhang Xiuying, a woman from Jingyuan Street, has a family of five, with a monthly grain ration of 114 jin. In order to ensure that the whole family eats well, has enough, and avoids waste, she divides the September grain into 30 portions, using 3 jin and 12 liang of grain per day, and carefully regulates the use of the daily grain allocation. Zhao Zhonghai, a resident of Xuexiang Street, and his wife jointly studied methods to save grain during cooking, and their family of four can now save 6 liang of rice and flour per day compared to the past.
    After residents of Xuchang City exchanged their experiences in saving grain, they overturned the idea that saving grain necessarily means eating more vegetables and allayed fears of not having enough to eat. At present, the vast majority of residents have made significant achievements in saving grain. After the implementation of the grain rationing system, the second residents' group of the Market Hou Street saw that 27 out of 42 households saved grain within twelve days, with the maximum savings per household reaching 5 jin and the minimum being half a jin. They plan to use the saved grain to offset the next month's grain consumption or to make adjustments among themselves within the group. (Zhang Xinzheng)

    许昌街道居民进一步节约粮食
    河南省许昌市实行粮食定量供应办法后，街道居民在中共支部和街政府的领导下，都纷纷举行座谈会，交流节约用粮经验，进一步节约粮食。井园街妇女张秀英家五口人，每月评定用粮一百一十四斤。她为了使全家人都吃好吃饱不浪费，把九月份粮食分成三十份，每天用粮三斤十二两，并将每天规定的粮食很好的进行调剂。学巷街居民赵中海和他爱人共同研究做饭节约办法，全家四口人每天就可以比过去节约六两米面。
    许昌市居民经过互相交流节约用粮经验后，扭转了认为节约必得多吃菜，和怕不够吃的思想顾虑。目前绝大部分居民在节约用粮上，做出了显著成绩。市场后街第二居民小组在实行粮食定量办法后，十二天内四十二户中有二十七户都节约了粮食，每户节约最多者达五斤，少者半斤；他们准备把节约下来的粮食，抵作下月吃粮或者在小组内互相进行调剂。（张新政）
