Xinhua News Agency, October 14th -- The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency issued a statement on October 13th regarding two foreign aircraft violating Bulgarian airspace.

    The statement points out that on the night of October 5th of this year, two foreign aircraft successively intruded into the airspace of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and scattered provocative and libelous leaflets. This obviously hostile action, which violates the basic requirements of international law, is undoubtedly the work of those in the West who are not interested in the recent general easing of international tensions, especially the easing of the situation in the Balkans.

    The statement said that in view of the unfortunate incident involving the Israeli passenger plane (the Bulgarian government and all the people have expressed deep regret over this matter), the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria specifically points out that these continuous provocative acts of foreign aircraft scattering provocative leaflets and dropping saboteurs on our territory, as well as the violations of Bulgarian airspace, cannot but arouse deep public indignation and the legitimate desire to punish the invading bandits. If such incidents continue to occur, the organs responsible for protecting our borders and security will take all necessary measures to deal with such sabotage. The full responsibility for these consequences will rest with those who instigate, equip, and dispatch air robbers to invade our country.

    保通讯社就外国飞机侵犯领空事发表声明
    新华社十四日讯　保加利亚通讯社十月十三日就两架外国飞机侵犯保加利亚领空事发表一项声明。
    声明指出，今年十月五日夜间，两架外国飞机相继侵入保加利亚人民共和国的领空，散发了挑衅性和诽谤性的传单。这种显然含有敌意的、并且违反国际法基本要求的行动，无疑地正是西方那些对最近时期国际紧张局势普遍缓和，特别是对巴尔干半岛局势的缓和不感兴趣的人所作的。
  声明说，保加利亚人民共和国政府鉴于曾经有以色列客机的不幸事件发生（保加利亚政府和全体人民曾对此事表示深深的遗憾），特指出，外国飞机在我国领土上散发挑衅性的传单和投掷破坏分子的这种接连不断的挑衅行为和对保加利亚领空的侵犯，不能不引起深深的公愤和要求惩办入侵匪徒的正当的愿望。如果这种事件继续发生，有责任保护我国边界和安全的机关，将采取一切必要的措施来对付这种破坏行为。这种后果的全部责任将落在那些唆使装备和派遣空中强盗侵入我国的人的身上。
