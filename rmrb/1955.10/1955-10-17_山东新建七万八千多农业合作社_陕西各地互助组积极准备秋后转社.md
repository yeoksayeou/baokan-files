Shandong Province had newly established more than 78,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives by the end of September, exceeding the original planned figures of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Including the original old cooperatives, the total number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province has developed to 166,220, with about 5 million farmer households participating, accounting for more than 46 percent of the total number of farmer households in the province. The newly established cooperatives in various regions are now actively engaged in basic farmland construction, purchasing agricultural tools and draught animals, and expanding the area sown for the autumn harvest.

Since the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee and the meeting of county and district Party committee secretaries in late August, county Party committees held Party representative meetings or three-level cadre meetings in the first half of September, and a large number of activists were absorbed to participate. Nearly 200,000 Party members, cadres, and activists attended the meetings throughout the province. The meetings in various regions conscientiously conveyed and studied Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation, formulated plans for the development and consolidation of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and deployed autumn work. After the meetings, various regions, with the township as a unit, systematically disseminated the information to the broad masses of people under leadership.

In Shandong Province, thanks to the long history of mutual aid and cooperation in the old revolutionary base areas and the Party's solid foundation, more than 80 percent of the old cooperatives achieved increased production this year, playing a demonstrative role. Furthermore, early preparations were made since the summer and autumn, the entire Party mobilized, and leadership was strengthened. Therefore, the movement has developed rapidly in a normal and healthy manner. The broad masses of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants have shown unprecedented excitement and enthusiasm in recent years. They describe this cooperative movement as "a heavy rain in a severe drought." They joined agricultural producers' cooperatives in large numbers, and many activists have become the backbone of cooperative management. (Xinhua News Agency)

In Shaanxi Province, a number of mutual aid teams in various counties are actively preparing to build agricultural producers' cooperatives after the autumn harvest. According to incomplete statistics from the three special districts of Weinan, Baoji, and Yan'an, more than 7,000 mutual aid teams and joint teams have recently applied to transition to cooperatives. Among the 69 mutual aid teams in Fuxian County that requested to transition to cooperatives, more than 20 have been brewing and preparing for key cadres such as cooperative directors and accountants. The fourteen mutual aid teams in Nanjie Village, Ba District, Fuping County, recently automatically studied the cooperative charter together and sent people to the old cooperatives to learn about the handling methods of land, livestock, and farm tools when joining the cooperative. Xu Chenghe's mutual aid team in Chenjiahe Village, Yaoxian County, recently formed a joint team with the neighboring mutual aid team in Liujiahe Village, purchased a publicly owned mule, a rake, and a cart, and applied to transition to a cooperative after the autumn harvest. The eleven mutual aid teams in Zhaojiagou Village, Er District, Lantian County, which had previously disbanded, have now been restored and are preparing to build cooperatives this winter.

Currently, the enthusiasm of Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and poor peasants in rural areas of Shaanxi for taking the road of cooperation is also very high. In the twenty-four townships of Chengcheng County, more than 1,330 peasant households have requested to join cooperatives, with poor peasants accounting for more than half. After hearing the propaganda of Chairman Mao's instructions, Yang Debiao and Tian Yuming, poor peasants in Xijiadian Village, Liu District, Bin County, immediately asked the cadres to build cooperatives in their village. More than twenty poor peasants in Weile Village, Ba District, Xunyi County, firmly requested to join cooperatives and actively brewed the leadership backbone of the cooperative and studied the cooperative charter. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation, more than seventy Communist Party members in Er Township, Malan District of the county, expressed that they would play an exemplary role in building cooperatives.

Currently, Party and government organs throughout the province are reviewing the transition conditions of many mutual aid teams and plan to transfer more than 374,000 cadres to go deep into the countryside to help peasants build cooperatives and transition to cooperatives. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山东新建七万八千多农业合作社
    陕西各地互助组积极准备秋后转社
    山东省到九月底为止，已新建农业生产合作社七万八千多个，超过了中共山东省委员会原订的规划数字。加上原有的老社，全省农业生产合作社已发展到十六万六千二百二十个，入社农户五百万左右，占全省农户百分之四十六以上。各地新建社目前正纷纷进行农田基本建设，添购农具耕畜，扩大秋种面积。
    从八月下旬省委召开扩大会议和县、区党委书记会议后，九月上半月，各县党委都召开了党代表会议或三级干部会议，并吸收大批积极分子参加，全省有党员、干部和积极分子近二十万人出席了会议。各地会议都认真传达和学习了毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示，制定了农业生产合作社发展和巩固的规划，并部署了秋季工作。会后，各地以乡为单位，有领导地层层贯彻到广大群众中去。
    山东省由于广大老区有长期互助合作的历史和党的基础，今年百分之八十以上的老社获得增产，发挥了实例示范作用，夏秋以来又早作了酝酿准备，全党动手，加强领导，因而运动得以正常、健康地迅速发展。农村中的广大贫农和新老中农中的下中农，表现了近几年来从所未有的兴奋积极，他们形容这次合作化运动是“大旱的时候下了一场大雨”。他们成批地加入了农业生产合作社，其中许多积极分子都成为办社骨干。（新华社）
    陕西省各县都有一批互助组正在积极准备秋后建成农业生产合作社。据渭南、宝鸡、延安三个专区的不完全的统计，最近已有七千多个互助组和联组申请转社。鄜县要求转社的六十九个互助组中，已有二十多个酝酿、准备好了社主任、会计等主要干部。富平县八区南街村十四个互助组最近自动在一起学习社章，并派人到老社学习入社时土地、牲畜、农具等处理办法。耀县陈家河村徐成和领导的互助组，最近已和相邻的刘家河村互助组成了联组，购买了公有骡子一头、耙一个、车一辆，申请秋后转社。蓝田县二区赵家沟村以前散了伙的十一个互助组，现在都已恢复起来，准备今冬建社。
    现在，陕西各地农村中的共产党员、青年团员和贫苦农民等要求走合作化道路的热情也很高。澄城县的二十四个乡中，要求入社的农民有一千三百三十多户，其中贫农占一半以上。邠县六区席家店村贫农杨德标和田玉明听到宣传毛主席的指示，立即要求干部在他们村里建社。栒邑八区未乐村的二十多户贫苦农民坚决要求入社，并积极酝酿社的领导骨干和学习社章。该县马栏区二乡七十多个共产党员，学习了毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示后，表示要在建社中起模范带头作用。
    现在全省各地党政机关都在审查许多互助组的转社条件，并计划抽调三十七万四千多名干部深入农村帮助农民建社和转社。　（新华社）
