Shandong, Henan, Guangdong, Zhejiang and other provinces are rectifying agricultural producers' cooperatives. The work of rectifying cooperatives in Zhejiang Province has already concluded. The cooperatives in various regions have been further consolidated after rectification, and the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members has also greatly increased.

Shandong Province had newly established more than 83,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives by early October. Together with the farmers who joined the old cooperatives, more than 3.3 million households have joined the cooperatives. Adding the original old cooperatives, the number of farmers in the cooperatives in the province has exceeded 5.3 million households, accounting for more than 49 percent of the total number of farm households, exceeding the original development plan by about 9 percent. Therefore, at present, except for some backward townships and a few areas where the establishment of cooperatives has been slower, development has generally been stopped, and all efforts have been turned to rectification and consolidation. The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires all localities to conduct a general inspection of the newly established agricultural cooperatives and the expanded old cooperatives, and to continue to carry out socialist prospects education and mutual benefit policy education for new cooperative members who have concerns. At present, the Laiyang, Linyi, Liaocheng, and other prefectural committees, as well as most counties, have successively held enlarged meetings of county party secretaries and district party secretaries, and have taken specific measures for rectifying cooperatives based on the specific conditions of each locality. Each special district and county has also sent many working groups to rural areas to specifically help rectify cooperatives.

While developing agricultural producers' cooperatives, Henan Province carried out rectification and consolidation of the original cooperatives. According to statistics from the six special districts of Anyang, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Xuchang, Xinyang, and Nanyang, more than 6,500 cadres were sent to participate in the work of rectifying and consolidating cooperatives. By mid-October, 26,534 cooperatives in the province had been rectified and consolidated or were nearing the end of rectification and consolidation work, accounting for more than 60 percent of the original cooperatives in the province. After rectification, 76 third-class cooperatives in Yuxian, Lin'ying, Luohe, and other places were transformed into second-class or first-class cooperatives. After rectification, 130 cooperatives in the nine counties of Qixian, Anyang, Linxian, Qingfeng, Puyang, Nanle, Tangyin, Yexian, and Bo'ai, cleared more than 100 landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and other elements who had infiltrated the cooperatives, purifying the internal structure. After rectification of five agricultural producers' cooperatives in the first district of Xingyang County, the proportion of poor peasants participating in the cooperative committees and being elected as production team leaders rose from 64.2 percent to more than 70 percent. The unity between middle peasants and poor peasants was further consolidated, forming a solid core force for the cooperative movement. In the work of rectifying and consolidating existing cooperatives, all localities have paid attention to closely integrating with rural party rectification work, starting with production and focusing on autumn income distribution. Some areas have paid attention to the development of new cooperatives while rectifying existing ones.

Since the end of August, nearly 10,000 of the more than 15,000 original agricultural producers' cooperatives in Guangdong Province have undergone a rectification work focusing on improving production, implementing the principle of mutual benefit, and purifying the organization. Most cooperatives have adopted the method of "private ownership, private raising, and leasing" for the draught cattle of the cooperative members; and have retained a small amount of private plots for the cooperative members. In rectifying agricultural cooperatives, all cooperatives have paid special attention to doing a good job in late rice production, carrying out activities to increase production such as pest control and topdressing fertilizer. More than 600 cooperatives in the four counties of Yangshan, Qingyuan, etc., have also launched labor competitions and production appraisals. Now, the late rice of the vast majority of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province is better than that of farmers outside the cooperatives.

The work of rectifying agricultural producers' cooperatives in Zhejiang Province has basically ended. The cooperatives that have been rectified and consolidated have generally implemented the principle of mutual benefit and initially improved management and administration. In the past, many cooperatives in the Jinhua, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and other special districts had low land valuation and land remuneration. After the rectification of cooperatives, all of them were fair and reasonable. In more than 200 cooperatives in Lishui and Lanxi counties, more than 1,800 cooperative members who had previously undervalued their assets had their valuations appropriately increased. More than 20,000 cooperatives in the Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and other special districts have largely cleared their financial accounts and improved their financial management systems during the rectification, and are currently compiling autumn harvest distribution plans. The cooperatives that have been rectified and consolidated have also generally implemented the contract labor system and established reward and punishment systems. After the rectification and consolidation in Zhejiang Province, the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members has greatly increased. More than 20,000 cooperatives in the late rice areas of Ningbo, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, and other special districts are formulating autumn harvest and winter planting plans, actively preparing for careful harvesting and expanding the winter planting area.

    山东、河南、广东、浙江等省
    整顿和巩固农业合作社
    本报讯山东、河南、广东等地正在整顿农业生产合作社。浙江省的整社工作已经结束。各地经过整顿的社都进一步得到了巩固，社员生产积极性也大大提高。
    山东省到十月上旬已新建农业生产合作社八万三千多个，连同参加老社的农户，新入社的农民达三百三十万多户。加上原有的老社，全省入社的农民已有五百三十多万户，占总农户的百分之四十九以上，超过原订发展计划百分之九左右。因此，目前除一部分落后乡和少数建社较迟慢的地区外，一般已停止发展，全力转向了整顿巩固工作。中共山东省委要求各地对新建立的农业合作社和扩大的老社要普遍检查一次，对有顾虑的新社员，要继续进行社会主义前途教育和互利政策教育。目前莱阳、临沂、聊城等地委和多数县都先后召开了县委书记和区委书记扩大会议，根据各地的具体情况，采取了各地具体整社措施。各专区和县还派出许多工作组，到农村具体帮助整社。
    河南省各地在发展农业生产合作社的同时，对原有社进行了整顿巩固工作。据安阳、洛阳、开封、许昌、信阳、南阳六个专区统计，派出参加整顿巩固社工作的干部有六千五百多人。到十月中旬，全省已经整顿巩固或将近结束整顿巩固工作的社有二万六千五百三十四个，占全省原有社的百分之六十以上。禹县、临颍、漯河等地的农业生产合作社经过整顿后，有七十六个三类社变为二类社或一类社。杞县、安阳、林县、清丰、濮阳、南乐、汤阴、叶县、博爱等九个县有一百三十个社经过整顿，清除了混入社内的地主、富农、反革命分子等一百多人，纯洁了内部。荥阳县第一区有五个农业生产合作社经过整顿后，贫农参加社务委员会、当选为生产队长的比例由原来占百分之六十四点二，上升为百分之七十以上，中农、贫农之间的团结更巩固了，形成了一个坚定的合作化运动的核心力量。各地在现有社的整顿巩固工作中，注意密切结合农村整党工作，从生产入手，抓住秋季收益分配，有些地区在整顿同时，注意了发展新社的工作。
    广东省原有的一万五千多个农业生产合作社，从八月底以来已有近一万个社进行了一次以搞好生产、贯彻执行互利原则和纯洁组织为主要内容的整顿工作。大部分社对于社员的耕牛采取了“私有、私养、租用”的办法；并给社员保留了小量的自留地。在整顿农业社中，各社特别注意搞好晚稻生产，开展除虫、追肥等增产活动。阳山、清远等四个县的六百多个社还展开了劳动竞赛和生产评比。现在全省绝大部分农业生产合作社的晚稻比社外农民的好。
    浙江省整顿农业生产合作社的工作已基本结束。经过整顿巩固的社，一般都贯彻执行了互利原则，初步改善了经营管理。金华、温州、宁波等专区原来很多社土地评产和土地报酬偏低，整社后都做到公平合理了。丽水、兰谿两县两百多个社中，有一千八百多户社员原来评产过低的都得到了适当提高。嘉兴、温州、宁波等专区两万多个社在整顿中大部清理财务账目，健全了财务管理制度，目前正普遍编造秋收分配方案。经过整顿巩固的社还普遍推行了包工制，建立了奖惩制度。浙江省经过整顿巩固的社，社员生产积极性大大提高。宁波、嘉兴、温州等专区晚稻地区经过整顿的两万多个社，正纷纷制定秋收冬种计划，积极准备细收细打和扩大冬种面积。
