    Jiangsu Province Holds Sports Meet
    The Second People's Sports Meet of Jiangsu Province was held in Nanjing from October 2nd to 4th. A total of 465 athletes participated, coming from factories, schools, organizations, and military units in 54 cities and counties. During the three-day event, track and field, gymnastics, and cycling competitions were held. Records were broken in 22 events across the province. Cha Jiaqin, a female athlete from Zhenjiang City, broke the national record for the women's 3,000-meter bicycle race with a time of 6 minutes and 16.8 seconds.
    Among the outstanding athletes were many advanced workers and "Three Goods" students. For example, Wang Zuoyou, a porter who attended the Xuzhou City Labor Model Representative Conference, won first place in the 5,000-meter race and second place in the 10,000-meter race at this sports meet. Tao Yiyuan, a "Three Goods" student who attended the Suzhou City Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference, won first place in both the women's 200-meter and 400-meter races, breaking provincial records in both events. Cha Jiaqin, the female athlete from Zhenjiang City who broke the national record for the women's 3,000-meter bicycle race, is an outstanding PLA soldier who has been awarded the Third Class Merit. Wang Zhenzhen, an excellent Young Pioneer from Xuzhou City, won first place in the women's long jump.
    Many new forces have emerged in gymnastics competitions. For example, Yang Jingling, an athlete from Wuxi who only became interested in gymnastics in 1953, won first place in both the women's balance beam and uneven bars events. Many advanced gymnastics moves, which only a few athletes could perform in 1953, are now moves used for fierce competition by more than a dozen athletes.

    江苏省举行体育运动大会
    江苏省于十月二日至四日在南京举行了第二届人民体育运动大会，参加大会的运动员共有四百六十五人，他们来自五十四个市、县的工厂、学校、机关和部队。大会在三天中进行了田径、体操、自行车比赛，有二十二个项目的成绩突破了全省纪录，镇江市的女运动员查家琴以六分十六秒八的成绩打破了女子三千公尺自行车的全国纪录。
    在优秀的运动员中，有许多人是先进的工人、“三好”学生。例如曾出席徐州市劳动模范代表大会的搬运工人王作友，在这次运动会上获得了五千公尺第一名和一万公尺第二名。曾出席苏州市青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的“三好”学生陶贻圆，获得了女子二百公尺和四百公尺两项第一名，两项成绩都打破了全省纪录。打破女子三千公尺自行车全国纪录的镇江市女运动员查家琴，是曾立过三等功的解放军优秀战士。徐州市优秀的少年先锋队队员王珍珍获得了女子跳远第一名。
    在体操比赛中已出现了许多新生力量，如一九五三年才对体操发生兴趣的无锡运动员杨景玲，这次获得了女子平衡木和高低杠两项第一名。体操中许多高级的动作，在一九五三年只是个别运动员会做，现在已是十几个运动员激烈竞赛的动作了。
