Xinhua News Agency Report: Recently, another group of cities and towns has implemented a rationing system. These include major cities such as Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Shenyang, as well as some small and medium-sized cities and towns. In Shandong Province, 101 cities and towns implemented rationing in the first half of October. In Shaanxi Province, 95 percent of the cities and towns that should have implemented rationing by the beginning of October had already done so. In Yunnan Province, the areas that have implemented rationing include the urban areas of 107 counties and cities and 266 market towns. Other areas are also gradually beginning to implement it in county towns and market towns.

  While implementing rationing, many residents have further conserved grain. The situation in various regions proves that: by carefully arranging family life and conserving grain, the supply standard is sufficient for the vast majority of people to eat and use, and some even have surpluses. A few shortages can be resolved through adjustments. According to surveys on the grain consumption of some residents in Shanghai, Nanjing, Xi'an, Wuhan, and other cities, the rationing standard is sufficient for 87 to 90 percent or more of the population. In Shanghai, 6 to 8 percent of residents have a grain surplus.

  Three months have passed in the 1955-1956 grain year. In July, August, and September, the amount of grain sold in 237 large and medium-sized cities across the country decreased month by month compared to the same period last year, and the magnitude of the decrease increased month by month: 4.14 percent in July; 9.01 percent in August; and 11.13 percent in September. According to statistics from six large and medium-sized cities, including Shanghai, Jinan, Xi'an, Nanjing, Fuzhou, and Baoding, the grain sales volume in this year can be reduced by 10 percent compared to the previous year after the implementation of grain rationing. It is estimated that if the national urban grain sales volume decreases by an average of 7 percent compared to the previous year, 2 to 3 billion jin of grain can be saved throughout the year.

    全国许多市镇开始实行粮食定量供应制度
    据新华社讯  最近一个时期，又有一批市镇实行了定量供应制度。其中包括上海、武汉、重庆、沈阳等大城市和一部分中小市镇。山东省十月上半月内，有一百零一个市镇实行了定量供应。陕西省十月初全区应该实行定量供应的市镇，已有百分之九十五开始实施。云南省已实行定量供应的地区，包括一百零七个县、市的城区和二百六十六个集镇，其他各地区也陆续开始在县城和集镇上实行。
  在实行定量供应同时，许多居民进一步节约了粮食。各地的情况都证明：认真安排家庭生活，节约粮食，绝大部分人的供应标准都够吃够用，有些人还有剩余。少数短缺的，可以在调剂中解决。根据上海、南京、西安、武汉等市对一部分居民用粮情况的调查，定量供应标准足以够吃够用的占百分之八十七到九十以上，上海粮食有剩余的居民占百分之六到百分之八。
    一九五五—一九五六这个粮食年度已过去了三个月，七、八、九这三个月，全国二百三十七个大、中城市的粮食销售数量和去年同期比较，不但逐月下降，而且下降幅度逐月增大：七月份为百分之四点一四；八月份为九点○一；九月份为十一点一三。据上海、济南、西安、南京、福州、保定六个大中城市统计，实行粮食定量供应以后，这个年度粮食销售量可比上一年度减少百分之十。据估计，如果全国市镇的粮食销售量平均比上一年度减少百分之七，全年就可以节约二十到三十亿斤粮食。
