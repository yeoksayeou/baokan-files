Respected Chargé d'Affaires, Friends, Comrades!

    Today is the sixth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. On behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, I extend warm congratulations to you, Chargé d'Affaires, and through you to the government of the German Democratic Republic and all the German people.

    The German Democratic Republic is the first truly peace-loving and democratic country in German history. From the day of its founding, it has unswervingly embarked on the road of socialist construction. In recent years, the German Democratic Republic has made great achievements in developing the national economy and improving the people's living standards. It has made significant contributions in the struggle against the revival of West German militarism and for the peaceful reunification of Germany, and is playing an increasingly important role in the struggle to safeguard European and world peace.

    The treaty between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, concluded recently in Moscow as a result of negotiations between the two countries, has brought the friendly relations between the two countries to a new stage. This treaty not only further develops the solidarity and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, but also contributes to the cause of German unification, and is of great significance for maintaining European security and world peace. Therefore, the Chinese people warmly welcome and celebrate the signing of this treaty.

    Rebuilding Germany into a unified, democratic and peace-loving country is first and foremost a matter for the German people themselves, and therefore requires the joint efforts of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Not long ago, the negotiations initiated by the Soviet Union to establish diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, and the agreements reached, provided favorable conditions for the rapprochement between the East and West parts of Germany. The Chinese people welcome the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, and fully support the Soviet Union's correct position on the German question and its various measures to further ease international tensions, establish European collective security and develop international cooperation.

    The Chinese and German people have always had a deep friendship, which has been continuously developed and consolidated in the process of friendly cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic. The Chinese government will further consolidate and develop the fraternal solidarity and friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic.

    Dear comrades, friends, on this momentous festive occasion, let us raise our glasses:

    To the prosperity and development of the German Democratic Republic,

    To the friendship between the Chinese and German people,

    To the health of the respected President Wilhelm Pieck, to the health of Prime Minister Grotewohl,

    To the unity of the entire German people in building a unified, peaceful and democratic Germany,

    To lasting peace in Europe and the world!

    邓小平副总理的讲话敬爱的代办同志，朋友们，同志们！
    今天是德意志民主共和国建国六周年，我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向您，代办同志，并通过您向德意志民主共和国政府和全德意志人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    德意志民主共和国是德国历史上第一个真正爱好和平和民主的国家，它从成立的一天起，就坚定不移地走上了社会主义建设的道路。几年来，德意志民主共和国在发展国民经济和改善人民生活方面获得了巨大的成就，它在反对复活西德军国主义和争取德国和平统一的斗争中作了重大的贡献，在维护欧洲和世界和平的斗争中起着日益重要的作用。
    最近苏联同德意志民主共和国在莫斯科谈判结果所缔结的两国间的关系条约，使两国的友好关系走上了一个新的阶段。这个条约不仅使苏联和德意志民主共和国间的团结友好关系更加发展，而且有助于德国统一的事业，对维护欧洲的安全和世界的和平有着重要意义。因此，中国人民热烈欢迎和庆贺这一条约的签订。
    把德国重新建成为统一的、民主的和爱好和平的国家，首先是德国人民自己的事情，因而需要德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的共同努力。不久以前，由苏联倡议举行的苏联和德意志联邦共和国建立外交关系的谈判和所达成的协议，为德国东西两部分的接近提供了有利的条件。中国人民欢迎苏联和德意志联邦共和国关系的正常化，并完全支持苏联在解决德国问题上的正确主张和进一步和缓国际紧张局势、建立欧洲集体安全和发展国际合作的各项措施。
    中国人民和德国人民一向有着深厚的友谊，这种友谊已在中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的友好合作过程中得到了不断的发展和巩固。中国政府将进一步巩固和发展中华人民共和国同德意志民主共和国之间的兄弟般的团结友好关系。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们，在这个具有重大意义的节日，让我们
    为德意志民主共和国的繁荣和发展，
    为中国人民和德国人民的友谊，
    为敬爱的威廉·皮克总统的健康、为格罗提渥总理的健康，
    为全德人民团结一致来建立一个统一、和平、民主的德国，
    为欧洲和世界的持久和平而干杯！
