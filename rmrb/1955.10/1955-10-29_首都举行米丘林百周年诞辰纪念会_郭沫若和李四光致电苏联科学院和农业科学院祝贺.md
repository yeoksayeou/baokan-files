Xinhua News Agency, October 28th. A grand meeting commemorating the centennial of the birth of the great natural transformer, I.V. Michurin, opened solemnly in Beijing on the 28th. Seated on the rostrum in front of the statue of Michurin were: Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council; Wu Yuzhang and Shen Junru, Vice Presidents of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Zhu Kezhen, Vice President; Chen Kangbai, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies; Liu Ruilong and Yang Xiandong, Vice Ministers of Agriculture; Zhou Jianren, Vice Minister of Higher Education; and well-known biologists such as Bei Shizhang and Tong Dizhou. Also on the rostrum were Academician Yudin, the Soviet Ambassador to China, and Soviet experts.

In his opening speech, Guo Moruo said: The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies are preparing to hold a three-day academic commemorative meeting starting today to commemorate our great scientific mentor. At the same time, we must promote and develop Michurin's theory to cooperate with the socialist construction of the motherland, especially to welcome the upcoming high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement. Guo Moruo pointed out: The agricultural cooperation movement is a large-scale socialist revolutionary movement, which is directly related to the entire national economic construction. Our scientific workers, especially biological scientists, should closely integrate our research work with the current central task of the country. While promoting agricultural cooperation, we must carry out research on transforming nature, improving varieties, improving soil, and increasing yield per unit area. We must take Michurin as an example and Michurin's theory as the foundation to carry out more comprehensive and in-depth research, and contribute our research results to the country in a timely and increasing manner.

Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, made important instructions at the meeting. He encouraged scientific workers to learn from Michurin's innovative spirit and patriotism in scientific research. He hoped that the older generation of scientists would unreservedly contribute their rich knowledge and experience to the people and closely integrate their scientific activities with the people's socialist construction and serve it faithfully. Senior scientists should enthusiastically and patiently cultivate young scientific talents, and young people should also respect the older generation of scientists and not adopt an attitude of opposition and mutual contempt. He believed that free academic debate should be promoted, and academic harmony should not be advocated. In academia, one should be skeptical and allow the expression of different opinions, and humbly accept criticism from others for one's own incorrect views. This is the scientific attitude of obeying the truth. He also pointed out: Free academic debate is not a free market where counter-revolutionary remarks can be freely disseminated. He finally pointed out that biological scientists must invest in the agricultural cooperation movement and serve agricultural cooperation.

Tong Dizhou, Deputy Director of the Department of Biology and Earth Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered a report at the meeting on "Creatively Studying and Applying Michurin's Theory to Serve China's Socialist Construction." The report summarized the achievements of Chinese biological scientists in learning Michurin's advanced theory, transforming academic thought, and applying Michurin's biological science theory in scientific research and agricultural production in the past six years. At the same time, it pointed out the shortcomings in learning and studying Michurin's theory and the direction of future efforts.

Soviet expert Prutskov from Beijing Agricultural University gave an academic report on "The Achievements of Michurin Science in the Soviet Union."

The conference also adopted congratulatory telegrams from Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Li Siguang, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, to Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Academician Lysenko, President of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

The conference received sixty-eight scientific papers collected by nine natural science specialized societies in the biology department on the achievements of studying and applying Michurin's theory, of which twenty-nine will be read and discussed at this commemorative meeting.

More than 1,400 biological scientists from Beijing and other places attended the conference today.

Also attending the conference were Soviet experts from relevant government departments and relevant universities, personnel from the Soviet Embassy in China, and more than 20 Soviet philosophers who are visiting China.

Xinhua News Agency, October 28th. Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Li Siguang, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, sent telegrams on the 28th to Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Academician Lysenko, President of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, to congratulate them on the 100th anniversary of the birth of Michurin, the most outstanding biologist in the Soviet Union. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows: To Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences; To Academician Lysenko, President of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences:

On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Academician I.V. Michurin, the most outstanding biologist and great natural transformer in the Soviet Union, our scientific workers and the broad masses of people, together with our Soviet friends, commemorate Academician Michurin's great contribution to the happy life and academic creation of mankind with high respect.

Our scientific workers are enthusiastically studying Michurin's theory and conducting a sharp struggle against the reactionary Weismann-Morganism. Under the brilliant light of Michurin's theory, we are actively carrying out research work, systematically collecting scientific facts from the rich experience of the vast number of farmers that are helpful to the development of Michurin's theory, sorting them out and applying them to improve agricultural production. Now, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies are holding grand commemorative meetings in Beijing and across the country to further develop and disseminate Michurin's theory. We now extend our warm congratulations to you and the Soviet scientific community in the name of the conference. Let us advance victoriously under the great Michurin banner for the development of science and the happy life of mankind. Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Li Siguang, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, Beijing, October 28, 1955

    首都举行米丘林百周年诞辰纪念会
    郭沫若和李四光致电苏联科学院和农业科学院祝贺
    新华社二十八日讯　伟大的自然改造者伊·弗·米丘林诞生一百周年纪念会二十八日在北京隆重开幕。坐在主席台上米丘林巨像前面的是：国务院副总理陈毅、中苏友好协会总会副会长吴玉章和沈钧儒、中国科学院院长郭沫若和副院长竺可桢、中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会副主席陈康白、农业部副部长刘瑞龙和杨显东、高等教育部副部长周建人以及贝时璋、童第周等著名生物学家，在主席台上的还有苏联驻中国大使尤金院士和苏联专家。
    郭沫若在开幕词中说：中国科学院和中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会从今天起准备举行三天的学术纪念会，来纪念我们这位伟大的科学导师；同时还要推广和发展米丘林学说，用以配合祖国的社会主义建设，特别是迎接即将到来的农业合作化运动高潮。郭沫若指出：农业合作化运动是一项大规模的社会主义革命运动，同整个国民经济建设有直接关联。我们科学工作者，特别是生物科学工作者，应当把我们的研究工作同国家当前的中心任务密切配合起来；和促进农业合作化的同时，我们必须进行改造自然、改良品种、改良土壤、增加单位面积产量的研究工作；我们必须以米丘林为榜样，以米丘林学说为基础，更全面地展开深入的研究，把研究成果及时地、愈来愈多地贡献出来。
    国务院副总理陈毅在会上作了重要指示。他勉励科学工作者要学习米丘林在科学研究上的革新精神和爱国主义精神；他希望老一辈的科学家要把自己丰富的知识和经验无保留地贡献给人民大众，要把自己的科学活动同人民的社会主义建设事业紧密的结合起来，并忠实地为其服务。老科学家要热情地耐心地培植年轻的科学人材，年轻人也要尊敬老一辈的科学家，并不要采取对立和互相轻视的态度。他认为应该发扬学术上的自由争论，不应该提倡学术上的调和主义，在学术上要怀疑和允许发表不同见解，对自己不正确的见解要虚心地接受别人的批评，这样才是服从真理的科学态度。他又指出：学术上的自由争论，并不是什么自由市场可以允许反革命言论的自由传播。他最后指出：生物科学工作者必须投入农业合作化运动，为农业合作化服务。
    中国科学院生物学地学学部副主任童第周在会上作了“创造性地研究和运用米丘林学说为我国社会主义建设服务”的报告。报告中综述了六年来中国生物科学工作者学习米丘林先进学说，改造学术思想以及在科学研究和农业生产中运用米丘林生物科学理论的成绩，同时指出了学习和研究米丘林学说中的缺点以及今后努力的方向。
    北京农业大学苏联专家普鲁茨可夫作了“米丘林科学在苏联的成就”的学术报告。
    大会并通过了中国科学院院长郭沫若和中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会主席李四光给苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫院士和全苏列宁农业科学院院长李森科院士的贺电。
    大会收到了生物学部门九个自然科学专门学会征集的有关学习和应用米丘林学说成就的科学论文六十八篇，其中二十九篇将在这次纪念会上宣读并讨论。
