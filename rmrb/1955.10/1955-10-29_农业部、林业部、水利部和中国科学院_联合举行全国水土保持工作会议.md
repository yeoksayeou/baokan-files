Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences jointly held the first National Soil and Water Conservation Work Conference from the 10th to the 20th. Deputy Prime Minister of the State Council Deng Zihui attended the meeting and gave important instructions. Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Forestry Liang Xi, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Zhu Kezhen, and Director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission Wang Huayun all made reports at the meeting. Representatives from various regions introduced typical experiences in soil and water conservation work in different regions.

The meeting pointed out that soil and water conservation work is of great significance in China's socialist construction. It is a mass-based and large-scale undertaking to transform nature, an effective measure to improve the production and living standards of people in mountainous areas, change the face of mountainous areas, and reduce waterlogging disasters in plains, and a fundamental method for fundamentally controlling river hazards and developing river water conservancy. In recent years, thanks to the leadership of Party and government at all levels, the efforts of the masses and cadres, and with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the national soil and water conservation work has achieved certain results. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1.8 million various check dams, 2,230 large and small silt retention dams, 9.61 million mu of field projects, 73.18 million mu of mountain closure for afforestation, more than 13.57 million mu of afforestation, and more than 4.9 million mu of grass planting have been completed nationwide. The above measures have controlled soil erosion over an area of more than 71,800 square kilometers. According to the soil erosion situation in various regions and the requirements of the Yellow River management plan, the current work should focus on the Yellow River and Yongding River basins. This work is related to the interests of the people throughout the country, especially the safety of the lives and property of cities, industries, mines, and hundreds of millions of people in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. The future policy is: under the principle of unified planning and comprehensive development, closely combining with the cooperative movement, fully mobilizing the masses, strengthening scientific research and technical guidance, vigorously storing water and conserving soil according to local conditions, striving to increase grain production, comprehensively developing agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production, and rationally utilizing water and soil resources to the maximum extent, so as to achieve the socialist construction goal of building mountainous areas, improving people's lives, fundamentally controlling river hazards, and developing river water conservancy. To this end, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy departments should closely cooperate to carry out comprehensive management.

The meeting determined that the task of national soil and water conservation work in 1956 is to control an area of 33,524 square kilometers. Among them, 15,847 square kilometers are in the Yellow River Basin, 2,400 square kilometers are in the Yongding River Basin, and a total of 15,277 square kilometers are in other areas. The meeting required provinces with serious soil erosion to formulate soil and water conservation plans for all mountainous areas in the province and annual implementation plans by the end of 1956.

During the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Deng Zihui pointed out that the broad masses of our country have accumulated rich experience in the struggle against nature and have created various methods adapted to local conditions. We must attach importance to these experiences and scientifically summarize and improve them. In areas without a foundation, pilot projects should be carried out first, and gradually promoted after gaining experience. The support and attention of the state and Party and government leaders at all levels, and the rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement, are favorable conditions for us to carry out our work.

After detailed discussions, the representatives attending the meeting believed that under the circumstances of the advent of the high tide of cooperation, the agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and water conservancy departments will work together to have the confidence to successfully complete the task of building mountainous areas and carrying out soil and water conservation. A total of 180 representatives from agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and scientific research departments from various regions participated in this meeting. After the meeting, the representatives from various regions went to Daquanshan in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, and Tianshui Prefecture in Gansu Province on the 21st to visit the local soil and water conservation work.

    农业部、林业部、水利部和中国科学院
    联合举行全国水土保持工作会议
    新华社二十六日讯　农业部、林业部、水利部和中国科学院在十日到二十日联合举行了第一次全国水土保持工作会议。国务院副总理邓子恢到会作了重要指示。水利部长傅作义、林业部长梁希、中国科学院副院长竺可桢和黄河水利委员会主任王化云都在会议上作了报告。各地区代表分别介绍了不同地区的水土保持工作的典型经验。
    会议指出：水土保持工作在我国社会主义建设中具有重大的意义，它是一项群众性的改造自然的巨大工作，是提高山区人民的生产和生活水平，改变山区面貌和减免平原水涝灾害的有效措施，是根治河流水害开发河流水利的基本方法。几年来由于各级党政的领导，群众和干部的努力，随着互助合作运动的开展，全国水土保持工作已取得一定成绩。根据不完全的统计，全国已完成各种谷坊一百八十万多座，大小留淤坝二千二百三十座，田间工程九百六十一万亩，封山育林七千三百一十八万多亩，造林一千三百五十七万多亩，种草四百九十万多亩。以上措施，共控制水土流失面积七万一千八百多平方公里。根据各地水土流失情况和黄河治理规划的要求，目前工作应以黄河、永定河流域为重点。这一工作关系着全国人民的利益，特别是黄河中、下游城市、工矿和亿万人民生命财产的安全。今后的方针是：在统一规划综合开发的原则下，紧密结合合作化运动，充分发动群众，加强科学研究和技术指导，因地制宜大力蓄水保土，努力增产粮食，全面地发展农、林、牧业生产，最大限度地合理利用水土资源，以实现建设山区、提高人民生活，根治河流水害和开发河流水利的社会主义建设的目的。为此，农、林、牧、水利各部门应紧密配合，进行综合治理。
    会议确定：一九五六年全国水土保持工作的任务为三万三千五百二十四平方公里的控制面积。其中，黄河流域一万五千八百四十七平方公里，永定河流域二千四百平方公里，其他地区共一万五千二百七十七平方公里。会议要求水土流失严重的省份，在一九五六年底作出全省所有山区的水土保持规划和分年实施计划。
    会议中，副总理邓子恢指出：我国广大群众在和自然作斗争中已经积累了丰富的经验，创造了各种因地制宜的办法，我们必须重视这些经验，加以科学的总结和提高。在没有基础的地区，首先应重点试办，取得经验后再逐步推广。国家和各级党政领导的支持和重视，农业合作化运动的迅速发展，是我们开展工作的有利条件。
    出席会议的代表经过详尽讨论后，认为在合作化高潮来到的情形下，农、林、牧、水利各部门一致努力，有信心胜利完成建设山区、开展水土保持的任务。参加这次会议的，有各地农、林、水利和科学研究部门代表共一百八十人。会议结束后，各地代表于二十一日分赴山西省阳高县大泉山和甘肃省天水专区参观当地的水土保持工作。
