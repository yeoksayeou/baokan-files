    Soviet Scientific Achievements
    Eradicating Malaria Completely Within Five Years
    Professor Sergeyev, Director of the Institute of Malaria and Parasitological Medicine of the Soviet Ministry of Health, recently told a TASS reporter that Soviet public health authorities have decided to completely eradicate malaria within the next five years.
    Sergeyev said: Today in the Soviet Union, malaria is no longer a widespread disease. The planned malaria eradication campaign began immediately after the end of the Patriotic War, and in the past ten years, the incidence of malaria has been reduced by more than 99 percent. Even in most residential areas of southern republics such as Armenia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, not a single new malaria patient has been found in the past two years.
    Sergeyev pointed out the importance of the free medical system and planned measures such as mosquito eradication in eliminating malaria. He pointed out that a new drug invented by Soviet scientists, Quinocide, has recently cured thousands of patients. Patients recover after one course of treatment (20 consecutive days). Only a very small number of patients need a second course of treatment.
    Sergeyev concluded by saying that Soviet scientists continue to study new and more effective prevention methods. We believe that, due to the improvement of people's living standards and medical achievements, Soviet public health authorities will be able to eliminate malaria in the Soviet Union.
    Power Plant Utilizing Underground Thermal Energy
    The Soviet Academy of Sciences has begun to study natural geothermal resources—a new source of energy for supplying industry and agriculture.
    Deep within the Earth is stored a large amount of thermal energy, which is continuously formed due to the fission of radioactive elements and other reasons. In mountainous and foothill areas with young volcanic activity, this energy approaches the surface in the form of hot water, steam, and gas. With current drilling technology, it is not particularly difficult to obtain the thermal energy stored at this depth.
    The Soviet Union's Far East, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the far north all contain abundant underground thermal energy resources. The first expedition organized by the Soviet Academy of Sciences has already begun exploration of underground geothermal resources in a certain area of the East. In addition, exploration work is about to begin in Central Asia and the Caucasus, where hot springs with temperatures above 100 degrees have been discovered through drilling.
    Geothermal power plants can be built using underground thermal energy. The design of such a power plant is very simple: steam is extracted from the depths of the earth through boreholes to drive steam turbines, which in turn drive generators to generate electricity.
    Recently, a report on the nation's first geothermal power plant was heard at the Moscow Power Engineers Conference. This type of power plant has great advantages over thermal or hydroelectric power plants. It does not require boiler rooms, fuel depots, dams, sluice gates, or similar equipment. The power plant actually works by relying on free thermal energy from underground. Therefore, the electricity it generates is the cheapest. In addition, in addition to extracting underground thermal energy, some valuable chemicals can also be obtained incidentally. (Xinhua News Agency according to TASS)

    苏联科学成就
    五年内彻底消灭疟疾
    苏联卫生部疟疾病和寄生物医疗研究所所长谢尔盖耶夫教授最近向塔斯社记者说，苏联的公共卫生机关已决定要在今后五年内彻底消灭疟疾。
    谢尔盖耶夫说：今天在苏联，疟疾已经不再是一种普遍的疾病了。在卫国战争结束后马上就开始了计划中的扑灭疟疾运动，在过去十年中，疟疾的发病率已减少了百分之九十九以上。甚至像亚美尼亚、土库曼和乌兹别克等南方共和国的大部居住区内，两年来都没发现过一个疟疾病的新患者。
    谢尔盖耶夫指出了免费医疗制度和消灭蚊子等有计划的措施对消灭疟疾的重要意义。他指出，最近利用苏联科学家所发明的一种新药——奎诺塞德治好了几千个病人。病人经过一个疗程（连续二十天）的治疗后就痊愈了。只有极少数的病人需要经过第二个疗程的治疗。
    谢尔盖耶夫最后说，苏联科学家们继续在研究新的、更有效的预防方法。我们相信，由于人民生活水平的提高和医学方面的成就，苏联的公共卫生机关将能够使疟疾在苏联绝迹。
    利用地下热能的发电站
    苏联科学院已经着手研究天然的热汽液资源——这是供应工业和农业以能量的新来源。
    在地球内部的深处储藏有大量的热能，这种热能是由于放射性元素的分裂和其他的原因而不断形成的。在幼火山活动的山区和山麓地区，这种能以热水、蒸汽和瓦斯的状态向地面靠近。在现在的钻探技术的条件下，要取得藏在这种深度的热能并不特别困难。
    在苏联的远东、高加索、中亚细亚以及极北地区都含有大量的地下热能资源。苏联科学院组织的第一考察队已在东部某一地区进行勘察地下热汽液资源的工作。此外，最近就要在中亚细亚和高加索进行勘察工作，在这两个地方曾经靠钻探发现过温度在一百度以上的温泉。
    利用地下热能可以建造起热液电力站。这种电力站的设计很简单：利用钻井把蒸汽由地球深处引出来推动汽轮机，而汽轮机就可以带动发电机发电了。
    最近在莫斯科动力学家会议上听取了关于全国第一座热液电力站的报告。这种电力站比起火力发电站或水力发电站来有很大优点。它不需要造锅炉房、燃料库、堤坝、水闸和诸如此类的设备。电力站实际上就是靠地下发出的不要花钱的热能来工作。因此，它发出的电力是最便宜的。此外，除去可以吸取地下热能外，还可以附带得到一些有价值的化学品。　（新华社据塔斯社讯）
