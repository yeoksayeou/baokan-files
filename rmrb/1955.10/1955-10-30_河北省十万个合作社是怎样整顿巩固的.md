How Hebei Province's 100,000 Cooperatives Were Rectified and Consolidated
Lin Tie, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

In the agricultural cooperativization movement in Hebei Province over the past few years, we have deeply realized that as long as we follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, cherish any small socialist element, stand at the forefront of the movement, and bravely lead the masses forward, we can achieve victory. Anyone who violates the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, criticizing from behind the masses, will inevitably cause setbacks and losses to the movement.

The agricultural cooperativization movement in Hebei Province has experienced twists and turns. In 1952, there were 1,082 agricultural production cooperatives in the province. In 1953, when the number of agricultural production cooperatives increased to more than 5,800, we underestimated the level of consciousness of the masses and the leadership of the Party, and wrongly implemented the so-called measures to oppose rash advances, "reversing" more than 2,150 cooperatives (accounting for more than one-third of the total number of cooperatives), leaving 3,645. At that time, cadres at the North China, provincial, and district levels "went down to Daming Prefecture three times," blowing away more than 350 of the 400 cooperatives in Daming County in one gust of wind, leaving only 60, which greatly frustrated the socialist enthusiasm of the masses. This lesson was very painful; fortunately, the Party Central Committee pointed it out in time, and this mistake was not allowed to develop further.

In the winter of 1953, the Party organizations in Hebei Province vigorously publicized the Party's general line during the transition period. In the spring of 1954, the number of agricultural production cooperatives increased to more than 31,400 (the number of households joining the cooperatives accounted for 6.1 percent of the total number of farm households). At this time, we put forward the requirement to advance the cooperativization movement a big step forward and adopted the measures of year-round preparation and phased development. This spring, the number of cooperatives increased to more than 105,000, and the number of households joining the cooperatives reached 38.45 percent of the total number of farm households.

During this major development of cooperatives, some farmers who were not willing were indeed forced to join the cooperatives, and some phenomena that violated the policy of mutual benefit occurred. Therefore, some cooperatives had some middle peasants who were unwilling to invest in the cooperatives, some cooperative members were unwilling to actively accumulate fertilizer, some livestock were weak, and some cooperative members requested to withdraw from the cooperatives. At that time, some people, seeing this situation, pointed out that agricultural production cooperatives in Hebei Province had developed too much and were in chaos, advocating "unloading burdens, shrinking greatly, and throwing away a batch." We have not forgotten the painful lesson of making mistakes by blindly opposing rash advances in the first half of 1953. We carefully considered this issue and studied the actual situation. Although we wavered for a time on the issue of whether to develop further, and once included "resolutely stopping development" in the annual work plan, we did not adopt the wrong opinions on the issue of whether the cooperatives that had already been established could be consolidated. We believe that the vast majority of cooperatives are good and can be consolidated. We eliminated that pessimistic and negative sentiment, adopted a positive attitude of treating them with enthusiasm, strengthening leadership, and vigorously rectifying them, and were determined to consolidate the vast majority of cooperatives. After more than half a year of rectification, more than 92 percent of the cooperatives have been consolidated, and the vast majority of cooperatives have increased production. According to incomplete statistics, cooperatives whose output exceeds that of ordinary individual farmers account for more than 80 percent (generally increasing by about 10 to 20 percent), cooperatives whose production is equal to that of ordinary individual farmers account for about 15 percent, and cooperatives whose production is lower than that of ordinary individual farmers account for about 5 percent. In Wanquan County, the number of households joining the cooperatives in the spring of 1954 accounted for only 4.3 percent of the total number of farm households, but this year it has developed to 60 percent, an increase of 13 times. Because such a large development was prepared for year-round, was carried out vigorously by the whole Party, and had a certain mass base, the development was rapid and healthy, and 96 percent of the cooperatives increased production, with the total grain output of the county exceeding the original plan by 10 million jin. After rectification, none of the 408 cooperatives in the county collapsed.

How did we rectify agricultural production cooperatives?

In order to consolidate the vast majority of cooperatives, we classified the cooperatives with different situations and adopted different measures. For the first and second categories of cooperatives, which account for about 70 percent and are consolidated and relatively consolidated, the main task is to inspect and guide them to further improve production management, while producing, while further solving the problems that cooperative members urgently demand to be solved according to the policy of mutual benefit. The third category of cooperatives, which account for about 20 percent, are regarded as the focus of rectification. Relying on Party members, League members, and activists, we made the thinking of the less firm cooperative members firm, and patiently persuaded those cooperative members who asked to withdraw from the cooperatives not to withdraw or to withdraw less. For the fourth and fifth categories of cooperatives, which account for about 10 percent and do not have the conditions for running cooperatives and are manipulated by landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements, we initially decided to let them be converted into mutual aid groups or be disbanded; later, we found that a part of these cooperatives had a few cooperative members (mainly poor peasants) who were determined to continue running them, and we supported them. As a result, these cooperatives became smaller cooperatives and were retained. This classification and differentiated treatment generally avoided the mistake of blindly shrinking and rectified most of the cooperatives well. Our working steps are: first solve the problems of the fourth and fifth categories of cooperatives, then concentrate our efforts on rectifying the third category of cooperatives, while at the same time taking into account the consolidation work of the first and second categories of cooperatives. This comprehensive arrangement and phased rectification generally avoided the possible tendency of "blooming everywhere and dispersing in a rush."

In order to consolidate the vast majority of cooperatives, we firmly grasped the three links of earnestly doing a good job in production, adhering to the policy of mutual benefit, and raising the consciousness of cooperative members in the rectification work. When carrying out these tasks, we relied on Party members, League members, and poor peasants to unite with middle peasants. At the beginning of the rectification work, it was the busy season of spring plowing and sowing, and the cooperative members were worried that production would not be done well; as long as the production was arranged first, the cooperative members would be half at ease, and other problems would be easy to discuss. Then, after further solving the problem of mutual benefit, the cooperative members' enthusiasm for unity and production was even higher. How to discover the issues related to mutual benefit that hinder production and are of most concern to poor and middle peasants? How to solve these problems? The experience of various places has proved that first of all, it is necessary to educate the vast number of Party members, League members, activists, and poor peasant cooperative members to discuss how to run the cooperatives well; in the discussion, a core force can be formed, and good ways to discover problems and solve problems can be obtained; then, after consulting with the middle peasants, the issues related to mutual benefit can be solved one by one. When the rectification work of Rujiao Village in Wu'an County began, the staff only listened to the words of the cooperative director He Ming (branch secretary, family component is upper-middle peasant), and did not find the problem of middle peasants exploiting poor peasants by using livestock and large carts (under normal circumstances, a cart and horse can earn no more than three yuan and five jiao a day for pulling loads outside; however, according to the regulations of this cooperative, a cart and horse can earn 19 yuan a day for delivering fertilizer in the cooperative), and did not rectify the cooperative well. Later, after rectification, the poor peasants were deeply mobilized, and this problem was discovered. In order to unite the middle peasants and run the cooperatives well, the poor peasants expressed "as long as they do not exploit us," actively colluded and persuaded the representative figures of the middle peasants, and after repeated consultations, the problem was reasonably solved. The cooperative director He Ming made a self-criticism and expressed his determination to change his selfish and self-interested habits. The unity between the poor and middle peasants was enhanced, and production was also done well. Some staff only talked about voluntariness and solved the problems of "withdrawing households" and uniting middle peasants in isolation, resulting in more and more withdrawing households and more and more disunity after rectification. The lesson of Chen Village in Luancheng County in rectifying the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative is like this. At the beginning of the rectification of the cooperative, only three households asked to withdraw from the cooperative; later, the number of withdrawals increased to 24 households; but after adopting the correct method, the cooperative was rectified well.

When solving the problem of mutual benefit, it is not enough to just deal with the matter as it stands, and only make economic concessions to the middle peasants without political education; on the contrary, paying attention to political education and earnestly implementing the policy of mutual benefit on the basis of raising the consciousness of cooperative members can solve the problem well. A cooperative in Cheng'an County made concessions to the excessive demands of the middle peasants during the rectification process without carrying out the necessary education. Although the solution to the problems of waterwheels and wells was beneficial to the middle peasants, the middle peasants still withdrew from the cooperative. When Xingtai County's Baiquan Agricultural Production Cooperative was solving the problem of livestock rental prices, the middle peasants demanded that the rental price be set at 120 yuan, and the poor peasants believed that it could only be set at 70 yuan, and the quarrel was very fierce; after carrying out the education of socialism and mutual benefit, the two sides repeatedly negotiated and stipulated that the rental price was 80 yuan according to the principle of mutual benefit, and both the middle and poor peasants agreed, and the problem was solved satisfactorily. This proves that the change of production relations is inseparable from ideological transformation.

In the process of rectification, we focused on solving the problems of cooperative members' methods of using draft animals, remuneration for labor and land, cooperative members' investment, and remuneration for the work of backbone members of the cooperative. Regarding the methods of using draft animals in the cooperative, it should be affirmed that public ownership and public raising are advanced forms; adopting this form in cooperatives that have the conditions is in line with the requirements of developing production and consolidating and improving cooperatives. However, in the first year or two of the establishment of the cooperative, we believe that it is better to adopt the method of private ownership and private raising with the cooperative renting or hiring them. In the initial stage of the cooperative, when the economy is relatively difficult, this can avoid the phenomenon of excessive debt in the cooperative and poor feeding of livestock, which is more conducive to protecting and increasing livestock. After the conditions are met, public ownership and public raising can be gradually implemented. The issue of labor remuneration for labor and land in the cooperative, based on the production level of most cooperatives, we stipulate that in general new cooperatives in general areas, labor remuneration should not be lower than 50 percent of the actual income, and the highest should not be higher than 60 percent. Generally, it will be stabilized for two or three years before gradually increasing. If it is necessary to increase labor remuneration in some areas, it can be approved by the prefectural committee. We also stipulated that cooperative members' private vegetable plots should generally be about one fen per person on average; cooperative members are allowed to engage in household sideline occupations suitable for decentralized management, correcting and preventing inappropriate practices such as unified management by the cooperative. With more cooperatives, the scale of the cooperatives has gradually expanded, and the work remuneration of the backbone members of the cooperatives has become a major issue. This issue has also been preliminarily resolved in the rectification process. According to the specific situation in Hebei Province, two methods are generally adopted for the remuneration of staff in large and medium-sized cooperatives: one is fixed subsidies; the other is fixed distribution with flexible supplements. The standard of subsidies is: to make the remuneration obtained by the backbone members plus their general labor income equivalent to or slightly higher than the income of medium labor, but the highest does not exceed the income of the strongest labor in the cooperative. The number of backbone members subsidized by each cooperative is determined according to the size of the cooperative and the complexity of the affairs. In small cooperatives, the method of temporarily recording work hours for business-related work is mostly used.

In order to consolidate the vast majority of cooperatives, we transferred 14,000 staff members to the countryside this year to assist, guide, and closely rely on the grassroots Party organizations to carry out work. Party secretaries and other responsible personnel at all levels went deep into the grassroots, did a good job in key points, set an example, summarized experience, and guided the movement. This played a decisive role in rectifying and consolidating 100,000 cooperatives; at the same time, it also enabled a large number of cadres to be trained into experts in practical work and effectively improved the style of leadership. This is a great gain.

On the basis of rectifying and consolidating nearly 100,000 cooperatives, the agricultural cooperativization movement in Hebei Province has been further advanced. From the end of August to October 10, more than 1.62 million households of new cooperative members have joined the old and new cooperatives. The province's original plan to reach 58 percent of the total number of farm households joining cooperatives this winter and next spring can be overfulfilled by the end of October. In November, we can fully turn to new rectification work. We believe that as long as we fully utilize past experience and strengthen leadership, these newly built cooperatives will surely be consolidated.

    河北省十万个合作社是怎样整顿巩固的
    中共河北省委书记　林铁
    在河北省几年来的农业合作化运动中，我们深深地体会到：只要按照党中央和毛主席的指示，爱护任何一点微小的社会主义因素，站在运动的前列，勇敢地领导群众前进，就能够取得胜利；凡是违背了党中央和毛主席的指示，在群众的后头指责批评，就必然会使运动受到挫折和损失。
    河北省的农业合作化运动是曾经发生过波折的。一九五二年，全省共有农业生产合作社一千零八十二个。一九五三年，当农业生产合作社发展到五千八百多个的时候，我们对群众的觉悟程度和党的领导力量估计不足，错误地执行了所谓反对急躁冒进的措施，把两千一百五十多个社（占总社数的三分之一以上）“反”掉了，剩下了三千六百四十五个。当时，华北、省、专区三级干部“三下大名府”，把大名县的四百多个社一阵风吹散了三百五十多个，只剩下六十多个，使群众的社会主义积极性受到很大挫折。这次教训是很令人痛心的；幸而由党中央及时指出，没有再把这个错误发展下去。
    一九五三年冬季，河北省的党组织大张旗鼓地宣传了党在过渡时期的总路线。一九五四年春，农业生产合作社增加到三万一千四百多个（入社户占总农户的百分之六点一）。这时，我们提出了把合作化运动向前推进一大步的要求，并且采取了常年准备、分批发展的措施。今年春天，社数增加到十万五千多个，入社户达到总农户的百分之三十八点四五。
    在这次合作社大发展中，确实有一些不自愿的农民勉强入了社，也发生了一些违反互利政策的现象；因此，某些社曾经有一些中农不愿在社内投资，有一些社员不愿积极积肥，有一些牲口瘦弱了，有一些社员要求退社。当时，有人看到这种情形，就指出河北省农业生产合作社发展得太多了，乱了，主张“卸包袱，大收缩，甩掉一批”。我们没有忘记一九五三年上半年盲目反对冒进犯了错误的沉痛的教训。我们慎重地考虑了这个问题，研究了实际情况。虽然，在是不是要再发展的问题上，我们一度动摇了，曾经把“坚决停止发展”列入全年的工作方针；但是，在已经办起来的社是不是能巩固的问题上，我们没有采纳错误的意见。我们认为绝大多数合作社是好的，能够巩固的。我们排除了那种悲观消极的情绪，采取了热情对待、加强领导、大力整顿的积极的态度，决心把绝大多数社巩固下来。经过半年多的整顿，百分之九十二以上的社巩固下来了，绝大多数社都增加了产量。据不完全统计，产量超过一般单干农民的社占百分之八十以上（一般的增产一成到二成左右），同一般单干农民生产相平的社约占百分之十五，低于一般单干农民的社约占百分之五。万全县一九五四年春季入社户还只占总农户的百分之四点三，今年发展到了百分之六十，增加了十三倍。因为这样的大发展是经过常年准备的，是全党动手大力进行的，是有一定的群众基础的，所以发展得迅速而且健康，百分之九十六的社都增产了，全县的粮食总产量超过原定计划一千万斤。全县四百零八个社，经过整顿一个也没有垮。
    我们是怎样整顿农业生产合作社的呢？
    为了把绝大多数社巩固下来，我们把各种不同情况的社分了类，采取了不同的措施。对于约占百分之七十的巩固的和比较巩固的第一、二类社，主要工作是检查和指导他们进一步做好生产管理工作，一面生产，一面进一步根据互利政策，解决社员迫切要求解决的问题。把约占百分之二十的第三类社，作为整顿的重点，依靠党员团员和积极分子，使不太坚定的社员的思想坚定起来，耐心说服那些要求退社的社员不退或少退。对于约占百分之十的不够办社条件的和被地主富农、坏分子操纵的第四、五类社，最初我们确定让他们转为互助组或者解散；后来，发现这类社里的一部分社有少数社员（主要是贫农）坚决愿意办下去，我们支持了他们。结果，这些社变成较小的社，保留了下来。这样分成几类，区别对待，就大体上避免了盲目收缩的错误，把大多数社整顿好了。我们的工作步骤是：首先解决第四、五类社的问题，然后集中力量整顿三类社，同时兼顾第一、二类社的巩固工作。这样全面安排，分批整顿，就一般地避免了可能发生的“全面开花、一轰而散”的偏向。
    为了把绝大多数社巩固下来，我们在整社工作中，紧紧抓住了认真搞好生产、坚持互利政策、提高社员觉悟这三个环节。在进行这些工作的时候，依靠了党员、团员和贫农去团结中农。在整社工作开始的时候，正是春耕播种紧张的季节，社员都担心生产搞不好；只要先把生产安排好，社员便安心了一半，别的问题就好商量了。然后，进一步解决了互利问题，社员的团结生产的情绪就更高了。怎样发现妨碍生产的、贫农中农都最关心的有关互利的问题呢？怎样解决这些问题呢？各地的经验证明：首先要教育广大党员、团员、积极分子和贫农社员，讨论怎样把社办好；在讨论中间，就可以形成核心力量，并且可以发现问题、得到解决问题的好办法；然后，再同中农协商，有关互利的问题就可以一一解决。武安县儒教村整社工作开始的时候，工作人员只听社长何明（支部书记，家庭成分是上中农）的话，没有发现中农利用牲口和大车剥削贫农的问题（按一般情况，车马出外拉脚一天也不过挣三元五角；可是，按照这个社的规定，车马在社里送粪，一天就可以有十九元的收入），没有把社整顿好。后来再整顿，深入发动了贫农，才发现了这个问题。贫农为了团结中农把社办好，表示“只要他们不剥削我们就行”，积极地串连和说服了中农的代表人物，经过反复协商，问题得到了合理的解决。社长何明作了检讨，表示决心改掉自私自利的毛病。贫农中农的团结增强了，生产也搞好了。有的工作人员只是空讲自愿，孤立地解决“退社户”的问题和团结中农的问题，结果，越弄退社户越多，越整顿越涣散。栾城县陈村整顿新民农业生产合作社的教训就是这样的。开始整社，只有三户要求退社；后来退社的增加到了二十四户；而在采取了正确的方法以后，就把社整顿好了。
    在解决互利问题的时候，只是就事论事，对中农只有经济上的让步而没有政治上的教育，是不足以团结中农的；反之，注意进行政治教育，在提高社员觉悟的基础上认真执行互利政策，就能很好地解决问题。成安县一个社在整顿过程中对中农的过分的要求一味让步，而不进行必要的教育，尽管解决水车、水井问题的办法对中农有利，结果中农还是退社了。邢台县百泉农业生产合作社在解决牲口租价问题时，中农要求租价定为一百二十元，贫农认为只可以定为七十元，争吵很激烈；在进行了社会主义和互利两好的教育以后，双方反复协商，根据互利的原则规定租价为八十元，中农贫农都同意了，问题圆满地解决了。这证明生产关系的改变和思想改造是分不开的。
    在整社过程中，我们着重解决了社员耕畜使用办法、劳力和土地的报酬、社员投资、社内骨干分子的工作报酬等等问题。关于社内耕畜使用办法，应该肯定公有公养是高级的形式；在具备条件的社里采取这种形式，是符合发展生产和巩固、提高合作社的要求的。但是，在合作社初办的一两年内，我们认为还是采取私有私养由社租用或雇用的办法为好。在合作社初办，经济比较困难的情况下，这样可以避免使社内负债过多和牲口使喂不善的现象，对保护和增殖牲畜比较有利。待有条件后，就可以逐步实行公有公养。社内劳力和土地的劳酬问题，我们根据大多数社的生产水平，规定在一般地区的一般新社，劳力报酬不得低于实际收入的百分之五十，最高不高于百分之六十，一般的稳定两三年后再逐步提高。有些地区如果需要提高劳力报酬，可经地委批准。我们还规定了社员自留的菜地一般每人平均留一分左右；允许社员经营适于分散经营的家庭副业，纠正和防止了一切归社统一经营的不妥当的做法。社多了，社的规模也逐渐扩大了，社内骨干分子的工作报酬已经成了一个重大的问题。在整社过程中，这个问题也初步地解决了。根据河北省具体情况，在大型中型的合作社里，对于工作人员的报酬大体上采用了两种办法：一是固定补贴；一是死分活补。补贴的标准是：要使骨干分子所得的报酬加上自己的一般劳动收入，相当于或者稍高于中等劳力的所得，但最高不超过本社最强的劳力所得。各社受补贴的骨干分子多少，是根据社的大小和事务的繁简来确定的。在小社里，多采用因社务误工临时记工的办法。
    为了把绝大多数合作社巩固下来，在今年的整社工作中，我们抽调了一万四千名工作人员下乡，协助、指导并紧紧依靠基层党组织进行工作。各级党委书记和别的负责人员，都深入下层，搞好重点，做出样子，总结经验，指导运动。这对整顿巩固十万个合作社起了决定作用；同时，也使大批干部在实际工作中锻炼成为内行，有效地改善了领导作风。这是一个很大的收获。
    在整顿和巩固了近十万个合作社的基础上，河北省的农业合作化运动已经又推进了一步。自八月底到十月十日，加入老社和新社的新社员已达一百六十二万多户。全省原定的今冬明春入社户达到总农户的百分之五十八的计划，于十月底就可超额完成。十一月份，就可以全面转向新的整顿工作了。我们相信，只要充分运用过去的经验，加强领导，这批新建的合作社是一定能巩固下来的。
