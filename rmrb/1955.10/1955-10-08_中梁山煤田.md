    Zhongliangshan Coalfield

    The verdant Zhongliang Mountain, like a barrier to the west of Chongqing, lies between the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. Geological exploration conducted here from 1953 to the present has proven that it is currently the largest coalfield in Southwest China. The coal is of good quality and can be used for coking. Moreover, due to its proximity to Chongqing city, transportation is also very convenient. In the years to come, it will provide abundant and inexpensive fuel to industrial and mining enterprises and residents in Chongqing, along the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, and along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.
    Currently, the exploration of the Zhongliangshan Coalfield is only in its final stages. All exploration tasks will be completed around November. Since June, batches of exploration personnel have been successively departing for new coalfield exploration areas. Over the past three years, the drilling personnel here have grown into a strong exploration team. In 1950, there were only about twenty people, living in a dilapidated temple on the mountain, guarding two dilapidated drilling rigs. Since the large-scale exploration began in 1953, in just three short years, this team has grown to several hundred people, with nearly twenty new drilling rigs. Initially, the personnel came from all directions, and their skills were unfamiliar. However, after a short period of learning and work, they have been able to extract batches of skilled exploration personnel to support newly established exploration teams in various places. By June of this year, they had successively sent out 23 rig supervisors, 102 team leaders, more than 200 drillers, and many technical and management personnel. Over the years, employees have also learned many advanced Soviet experiences, such as the "one-time sand injection method," "mud slurry operation method," and "new drill bit usage method," which have continuously improved work efficiency. For example, comparing 1953 with the first half of this year, the average monthly drilling footage per rig has increased from 90 meters to 171 meters; the average cost per meter has decreased from 60 yuan to 42 yuan. This year, employees have promoted the grouped use of drill rods and strengthened the inspection and maintenance system for drill rods. Previously, at least a hundred drill rods would break each month, but now the entire team breaks at most a dozen drill rods per month. They have overfulfilled their production plans every year. Chen Junjian, a Chongqing Special-Class Industrial Labor Model, leads the No. 3 drilling site, which is a banner for the entire team, maintaining the glorious title of model drilling site year after year.
    On September 5, a modern mine began construction on the Zhongliangshan Coalfield. Now, trucks loaded with various construction materials are continuously speeding towards the construction site along the newly built road. (Picture)

    中梁山煤田
    李策
    翠绿的中梁山，像重庆市西边的一座屏障，横互在长江和嘉陵江之间。从一九五三年到现在，在这里进行的地质勘探资料证明，它是目前西南最大的一个煤田。煤的质量好，可以炼焦。同时，由于靠近重庆市区，交通也很方便。在今后的岁月里，它将给重庆市、长江和嘉陵江沿岸以及成渝铁路沿线各地的工矿企业和居民们，提供丰富而又廉价的燃料。
    现在，中梁山煤田的勘探只剩下煞尾工作了。十一月前后全部勘探任务将要完成。从六月份起，成批的勘探人员已经陆续向新的煤田勘探区域出发了。三年以来，这儿的钻探人员已壮大成为一支有力的勘探队伍。一九五○年，这儿只有二十来个人，住在山上一座破庙里，守着两部破烂不堪的钻机。从一九五三年开始大规模的勘探以来，短短三年的光景，这支队伍已经发展到数百人，有近二十部新式的钻机。起初，人员来自四面八方，业务都是生疏的。但经过短时期的学习和工作后，他们已能抽出一批批熟练的勘探人员，去支援各地新建立起来的勘探队伍。到今年六月，先后向外边输送机长二十三人，班长一百○二人，钻工两百多人，以及许多技术和管理人员。几年来职工们也学会了许多苏联的先进经验，像“一次投砂法”、“泥浆作业法”、“新式钻头使用法”等，不断提高了工作效率。如拿一九五三年和今年上半年作比较，每台钻机每月平均进尺，从九十公尺上升到一百七十一公尺；平均每公尺成本从六十元降到四十二元。今年职工们推行了钻杆分组使用法，加强了钻杆的检修维护制度，以前每月至少要断一百来根钻杆，现在全队每月顶多断十几根。他们年年都超额完成了生产计划。重庆市特等工业劳动模范陈君鉴领导的第三钻机场，是全队的一面旗帜，年年保持着模范机场的光荣称号。
    九月五日，一座现代化的矿井已经开始在中梁山煤田上动工修建了。现在，满载各种建筑物资的卡车，正源源不断地沿着新修好的公路，向工地驰去。（图片）
