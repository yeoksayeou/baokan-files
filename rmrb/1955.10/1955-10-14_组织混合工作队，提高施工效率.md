Organize Mixed Work Teams to Improve Construction Efficiency
Lu Chaoqi

At the design and construction work conference held by the Ministry of Construction Engineering in February this year, Soviet expert A.V. Prokopiev introduced the Soviet construction enterprises' experience in organizing mixed work teams and compiling comprehensive task orders. He said that this is an effective way to improve construction efficiency. For more than half a year, the Sixth Engineering Department of the Northeast First Engineering Company, the Fifth and Seventh Engineering Departments of the Northeast Second Engineering Company, and the Fifth Work Zone of the Southwest First Engineering Company, all under the Ministry of Construction Engineering, have focused on promoting this experience. Practice has proven that organizing mixed work teams and compiling comprehensive task orders are indeed effective methods for strengthening grassroots organizations in construction enterprises, accelerating construction progress, improving project quality, and reducing project costs.

The grassroots labor organization of our state-owned construction enterprises underwent a reform in early 1954, along with the reorganization of construction teams. Work sections were established, and a foreman system was implemented, resolving the issues of dispersed leadership, unclear responsibilities, and lack of accountability among team leaders, captains, construction personnel, and technicians in grassroots organizations. However, the establishment of work sections at that time did not follow the principle of regional management, nor did it organize various workers involved in the construction process (such as machine bases, masonry, roofing, etc.) under the unified leadership and organization of the foreman based on the project objective. Instead, workers were organized separately according to their craft skills (such as carpenters, bricklayers, laborers, etc.), each with its own foreman. At the time, it was believed that only such a labor organization conformed to the principle of specialized division of labor. However, from the perspective of practical results, this is unscientific. For example, in bricklaying projects, bricklayers, scaffolding carpenters, and laborers who transport bricks and mortar to the work site must cooperate closely to do the work well and quickly. However, because the workers of these three trades are led by three different foremen and have separate engineering task orders, each professional trade often prioritizes work that is easy to complete according to its own quota during construction. If the bricklayers' speed increases, but the laborers do not transport bricks and mortar to the work site in time, or the carpenters cannot erect the scaffolding in time, the bricklayer foreman cannot command the laborers and carpenters to catch up. As a result, the bricklayers have to slow down the bricklaying speed or even stop working to wait for other trades. The waste of effective working hours caused by the lack of unified leadership and command of professional trades is quite alarming. According to the verifiable statistics of several work zones of the Northeast First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering last year, the waste in wages alone amounted to 520,000 yuan! The progress of the project was also affected.

The mixed work team organizes various workers involved in the construction process according to the project objective, under the unified leadership and organization of the team leader. The members of the mixed work team are mainly composed of the trades responsible for the main processes and final product. For example, in bricklaying projects, bricklayers should be the main trade of the mixed work team, and other auxiliary workers, such as scaffolding carpenters, laborers who transport bricks and mortar to the work site, and workers who operate relevant construction machinery and transportation tools, are all auxiliary workers. The number of people in each trade is also determined by the main trade. For example, to build 200 cubic meters of brick walls in five days, the number of bricklayers needed should be determined based on labor quotas, and then the number of laborers, carpenters, and other auxiliary workers needed to ensure the smooth work of these bricklayers should be determined. If there are more workers in the main trade, there will be more workers in the auxiliary trades, and if there are fewer workers in the main trade, there will be fewer workers in the auxiliary trades. To facilitate command and leadership in construction, the captain of the mixed work team should be a worker from the main trade with a higher technical level and organizational ability. He should also be familiar with the work of the various auxiliary teams, familiar with quotas, and able to understand construction drawings.

The construction labor organization of the mixed work team does not contradict the specialized construction labor organization, but is developed on the basis of the specialized construction labor organization. This is because: each of our engineering companies is organized in a specialized direction; the mixed work team is also organized according to specific engineering objects, and the various trades that make up the mixed work team are also specialized groups, led by a group leader. The captain of the mixed work team leads the various trades through the group leaders.

Corresponding to the organization of mixed work teams is the compilation and issuance of comprehensive engineering task orders. The engineering task orders currently issued by general construction units are issued to each professional group (such as bricklayer group, carpenter group, laborer group, steel bar worker group, etc.). In addition to the task orders for the main professional group specifying how many finished products are to be completed, the task orders for the auxiliary professional groups do not specify how many finished products are to be completed. For example, the task order for the laborer group specifies that one thousand bricks should be transported to the work site per day. As for whether these one thousand bricks are enough for the bricklayer group's daily use, the laborer group is not responsible. The comprehensive engineering task order takes finished products (such as one cubic meter of concrete machine base, one cubic meter of brick wall, one square meter of plastering project, or decoration project, etc.) as the unit of calculation. In order to complete the prescribed quantity of finished products, it also stipulates the workload of relevant trades. The amount of wages is also calculated based on the quantity of finished products completed. This enables the relevant trades to cooperate closely and makes every member of the work team concerned about improving labor productivity, shortening construction periods, and improving project quality.

In construction, the leadership of relevant trades is unified and centralized, and mutual cooperation is strengthened, which can avoid work stoppages and interruptions caused by inconsistent steps. In addition, every member is concerned about shortening the construction period and improving project quality, so construction efficiency can be greatly improved. Before the Sixth Engineering Department of the Northeast First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering organized mixed work teams and issued comprehensive engineering task orders, the average bricklayer only reached 104% of the current labor quota, the brick carrier only reached 91% of the quota, the mortar carrier only reached 72.3% of the quota, and the scaffolders often failed to meet the quota. After organizing mixed work teams and issuing comprehensive engineering task orders, the average of all professional trades in the team reached 139.7% of the current quota, of which the bricklayers reached 143% of the quota, the brick carriers reached 146.11% of the quota, the mortar carriers reached 139.4% of the quota, and the scaffolders reached 122.8% of the quota. At the same time, due to the increased sense of collective responsibility of the workers, the work site was also cleaner than before, and the mortar and broken bricks falling on the ground were also reduced. This advanced labor organization also promoted workers to pay attention to saving. The mixed work team organized by the Fifth Work Zone of the Southwest First Engineering Company exceeded the quota even when the technical level of the workers was lower than required by the labor quota, and some teams even reached 133% of the quota. The workers all said: Life is better than before.

The Northeast First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, in summarizing the work of the Sixth Engineering Department in experimenting with organizing mixed work teams and issuing comprehensive engineering task orders, pointed out that if the construction preparation work is done better, the average of all professional trades in the mixed work team can reach at least 150% of the current quota. This means that if all construction enterprises in the country seriously promote this advanced experience, we can complete three years' worth of quotas in two years under the existing workers and technical level. This is of extremely great significance for striving to complete the first five-year construction plan ahead of schedule. Therefore, every construction enterprise should attach importance to and promote this advanced experience, and strive to further shorten the construction period, improve project quality, and reduce project costs.

To make the mixed work team and the comprehensive engineering task order fully play their role, the preparation work for construction must be done well. After the Sixth Engineering Department of the Northeast First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering organized mixed work teams and issued comprehensive engineering task orders, the labor efficiency of each trade did not reach the average of 150% of the quota, but only reached 139.7%, because the construction preparation work was not done well at the beginning: the mortar transportation distance was long, and there was no light rail transportation; the ropes for tying scaffolding were not enough; the position of the winch was not appropriate; and the brick transportation distance was not calculated according to the actual situation, resulting in the auxiliary trades not being able to closely coordinate with the main trades. The experience of the Northeast First and Second Engineering Companies and the Southwest First Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering in focusing on organizing mixed work teams shows that when doing construction preparation work, the work team should be prepared with relatively fixed tasks, relatively fixed workers, and team leaders, to ensure the implementation of large-scale assembly line operations and cyclical operations. At the same time, the leadership organization and functional departments of the construction site should be strengthened accordingly to ensure that the mixed work team can play its role.

According to Soviet experience, the work of the mixed work team should be organized according to the work site (commonly known as the flow section), and the following work procedures should be stipulated: when the main work is carried out on the first section, the preparatory work should be carried out on the second section, so that the worker group of the main trade can transfer to the second section that has been prepared after completing the main work on the first section. At this time, the worker group of the auxiliary trade starts to prepare a new work line on the third section. This can ensure that each group can work continuously and evenly.

For the existing grassroots labor organization of construction enterprises, organizing mixed work teams and issuing comprehensive engineering task orders is a major reform. In the past, each trade calculated its own labor results separately, but now several trades jointly calculate labor results; in the past, workers of each trade worked separately, but now they are subject to the unified command of the team leader. In this way, some workers with higher technical level and stronger ability may be afraid that others will affect their income after joining the mixed work team; some auxiliary workers may not be accustomed to the command of the team leader selected from other trades. Therefore, when promoting this advanced experience, it is necessary to educate the workers on collectivism, and educate them on striving to complete the five-year plan; at the same time, explain to the workers that after everyone cooperates well and creates favorable working conditions for each other, work efficiency will not decrease, but will only increase, which is beneficial to the country and to individuals. Of course, from the perspective of administrative leadership departments, wages should be distributed reasonably according to the principle of distribution according to work, so that workers can be concerned about production from the aspect of material interests. Most of our construction workers have studied the Party's general line during the transition period, studied the Constitution, and studied the report on the first five-year plan, and are willing to strive to complete and over fulfill the first five-year plan ahead of schedule. As long as they understand the benefits of this advanced experience, they will actively implement it.

    组织混合工作队，提高施工效率
    陆超祺
    今年二月，在建筑工程部召开的设计及施工工作会议上，苏联顾问亚·华·普洛阔费也夫曾介绍苏联建筑企业组织混合工作队和编制综合任务单的经验。他说，这是提高施工效率的有效方法。半年多来，建筑工程部东北第一工程公司第六工程处、东北第二工程公司第五、第七工程处和西南第一工程公司第五工区，都有重点地推行了这一经验。事实证明，组织混合工作队和编制综合任务单，的确是加强建筑企业基层组织、加速施工进度、提高工程质量和降低工程成本的有效方法。
    我国国营建筑企业的基层劳动组织，在一九五四年初整顿建筑队伍的同时，就进行过一次改革，建立了工段，实行了工长制，解决了基层组织中班长、队长、施工员、技术员领导分散、职责不清、无人负责的问题。但是，当时工段的建立没有实行区域管理制的原则，没有按工程对象（如机座、砌筑、屋面等）把在施工过程中互相关联的各种工人组织在一起，由工长统一领导和组织施工；而是按工艺技术（如木工、瓦工、力工等）把工人分别组织起来，各有自己的工长。当时人们认为只有这样的劳动组织才符合专业化分工的原则。但是，从实际效果来看，这是不科学的。例如砌砖工程，瓦工、搭脚手架的木工和把砖头灰浆运到工作地点的力工，必须密切配合，才能把工作做得好，做得快。但因为这三个工种的工人属于三个不同的工长领导，各有单独的工程任务单。在施工过程中，各专业工种经常先做便于完成自己定额的工作，如果瓦工的速度加快了，力工没有及时地把砖头、灰浆运到工作地点，或者木工不能及时地搭好手脚架，瓦工工长也不能指挥力工和木工，使他们赶上去。这样，瓦工不能不放慢砌砖速度，或者不能不歇工，以等待别的工种。由于专业工种缺乏统一的领导和指挥所造成的有效工时的浪费是相当惊人的。据建筑工程部东北第一工程公司去年几个工区有据可查的统计，仅工资一项，就浪费五十二万元！工程进度也受到影响。
    混合工作队就是按工程对象把在施工过程中所需要的互相关联的各种工人组织在一起，由队长统一领导和组织施工。混合工作队的成员以负责主要工序而又最后制成产品的工种为主。例如在砌砖工程中，瓦工应该是混合工作队的主要工种，其它为砌砖服务的搭脚手架的木工，把砖和灰浆运到工作地点的力工，以及操纵有关施工机械和运输工具的工人，统统是辅助工人。各个工种的人数，也以主要工种来决定。如在五天内砌二百立方公尺的砖墙，就应先根据劳动定额来确定要多少瓦工，然后确定为保证这些瓦工能顺利工作需要多少力工、木工等辅助工人。主要工种的工人多些，辅助工种的工人也多些，主要工种的工人少些，辅助工种的工人也就少些。为了便于指挥和领导施工，混合工作队的队长应由技术水平较高、又有组织能力的主要工种工人来担任，他也应该熟悉各辅助小组的工作，熟悉定额，看懂施工图纸。
    混合工作队的施工劳动组织跟专业化的施工劳动组织并没有矛盾，而且是在专业化的施工劳动组织的基础上发展起来的。这是因为：我们的每一个工程公司都是按照专业化的方向组织的；混合工作队也是按具体的工程对象组织起来，组成混合工作队的各个工种也是专业小组，有小组长领导。混合工作队队长是通过小组长来领导各个工种的。
    跟组织混合工作队相适应的，就是编制和签发综合工程任务单。现在一般施工单位签发的工程任务单，是发给每一个专业小组（如瓦工小组、木工小组、力工小组、钢筋工小组等）的。除了主要工种的专业小组的任务单规定要完成多少成品以外，辅助专业小组的任务单都没规定完成多少成品，如力工小组的任务单规定一天搬运一千块砖到工作地点，至于这一千块砖够不够瓦工小组一天的使用，力工小组就不负责了。综合工程任务单，是以成品（如一立方公尺的混凝土机座、一立方公尺的砖墙、一平方公尺的抹灰工程或装修工程等……）为计算单位，为了完成所规定的成品数量，还规定了有关工种的工作量。工资的多少，也是以完成的成品数量来计算的。这就可以使有关的工种密切配合，使工作队的每一个成员都关心提高劳动生产率、短缩工期和提高工程质量。
    在施工中，有关工种的领导统一和集中了，相互协作加强了，就可以避免因步调不一致而发生的窝工、停歇现象。再加上每一个成员都关心缩短工期和提高工程质量，施工效率就能大大提高。建筑工程部东北第一工程公司第六工程处，在没有组织混合工作队和签发综合工程任务单以前，瓦工平均只达到现行的劳动定额的百分之一百零四，运砖工只达到定额的百分之九十一，运灰工只达到定额的百分之七十二点三，架子工也经常达不到定额。组织混合工作队和签发综合工程任务单以后，全队各专业工种平均达到现行定额的百分之一百三十九点七，其中瓦工达到定额的百分之一百四十三，运砖工达到定额的百分之一百四十六点一一，运灰工达到定额的百分之一百三十九点四，架子工达到定额的百分之一百二十二点八。同时，由于工人集体责任感增加，工作地点也比以前清洁了，掉落地面的灰浆和碎砖也减少了。这种先进的劳动组织也促进工人注意节约。西南第一工程公司第五工区所组织的混合工作队，在工人技术等级低于劳动定额所要求的情况下，都超额完成了定额，其中有的队竟达到定额的百分之一百三十三。工人们都说：生活比已往好做了。
    东北第一工程公司总结第六工程处试验组织混合工作队和签发综合工程任务单的工作时指出：如果施工准备工作做得好一点，混合工作队各专业工种，至少平均达到现行定额的百分之一百五十。这就是说，要是全国的建筑企业都认真推广这一先进经验，我们就可以在现有的工人和技术水平条件下，用两年的时间完成三年的定额。这对于争取提前完成第一个五年建设任务有着极其重大的意义。所以，每一个建筑企业都应该重视和推广这个先进的经验，为进一步缩短工期、提高工程质量、降低工程造价而斗争。
    要使混合工作队和综合工程任务单充分发挥作用，必须做好施工的准备工作。建筑工程部东北第一工程公司第六工程处组织混合工作队和签发综合工程任务单以后，各工种的劳动效率平均没有达到定额的百分之一百五十，而只达到百分之一百三十九点七，就是因为在开始的时候没做好施工准备工作：运灰距离远，没有轻便铁道运输；绑架子的绳子不够用；卷扬机安置的地位不适当；没有按实际计算运砖距离等，结果辅助工种不能跟主要工种情况密切配合。建筑工程部东北第一、二工程公司、西南第一工程公司重点组织混合工作队的经验说明，在做施工准备工作时，应该给工作队准备比较固定的任务、比较固定的工人和组长，以便保证实行大流水作业，循环操作。同时也要相应地加强施工的领导机构和职能部门，才能保证混合工作队发挥作用。
    根据苏联的经验，混合工作队的工作应该按工作地（俗称为流水段）来组织，并应该规定以下的工作程序：当在第一个地段上进行主要工作时，就在第二个地段上进行准备工作，以便主要工种的工人小组在第一个地段上完成了主要工作后，就能转到第二个已经准备好了的地段上去工作。而在这时，辅助工种的工人小组又开始在第三个地段上准备新的工作线。这样才能保证每一个小组可以不间断地均衡地进行工作。
    对于现有的建筑企业的基层劳动组织来说，组织混合工作队和签发综合工程任务单，是一个重大的改革。以前是各个工种单独计算自己的劳动成果，现在是几个工种综合计算劳动成果；以前是各工种工人分散活动，现在要受队长统一指挥。这样，就可能有一些技术水平较高，能力较强的工人，怕参加了混合工作队以后，别人影响他的收入；就可能有一些辅助工人，不习惯于由别的工种挑选出来的队长的指挥。因此，在推广这一先进经验时，就要对工人进行集体主义的教育，进行争取完成五年计划的教育；同时对工人说明大家配合好、相互创造有利的工作条件以后，工作效率就不会降低，而只会提高，对国家，对个人都有利。当然，从行政领导部门来说，应该按照按劳付酬原则，合理分配工资，使工人从物质利益方面关心生产。我国建筑工人大多数都学习过党在过渡时期的总路线，学习过宪法，学习过关于第一个五年计划的报告，都愿意争取完成和提前完成第一个五年计划。只要他们明白这个先进经验的好处，就会积极实行的。
