The Preparatory Office of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region held its first plenary meeting of all staff members on September 30. The meeting was presided over by Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Director of the Preparatory Office. He reported to everyone on the tasks of the organizations under the Preparatory Office and the division of personnel. He said: Under the instructions of the Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and after consultation and research by the Director and Deputy Directors of the Preparatory Office, it has been decided that the Preparatory Office will set up six sections including a Secretariat and Personnel section. The cadres of each section include staff from the Tibet Local Government, the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee, the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee, and the CPC Tibet Work Committee. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme emphasized that the State Council's decision to establish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is based on the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities and internal unity within Tibet. I hope that everyone in the Preparatory Office will work in this spirit, helping each other and working together as a family to strive for the early establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee.

Deputy Directors of the Preparatory Office Lobsang Samdan, Renchen Tanding Tserin Bangjor, Bonda Dorje, and Chen Jingbo all spoke at the meeting. They unanimously pointed out that all staff members of the Preparatory Office must love and unite with each other, and discuss matters together.
