    A Group That Consistently and Comprehensively Completes Plans
    Zhang Yanru
    The Second Work Area, Class B, of the Fine Spinning Workshop of the Second Branch of the State-Run Shanghai Seventeenth Cotton Textile Factory (formerly the Third Group) is one of the best groups in Shanghai's yarn factories in terms of fulfilling state plans. They consistently and comprehensively fulfill all the indicators stipulated by the state. For example, in July of this year, the weather was very hot, and some yellow cotton was mixed into the raw cotton, resulting in many breaks, making the work difficult. However, they were still able to complete the advanced group indicators. Taking the production of white waste as an example, the group with the highest planned output set their target at 11 liang per machine per shift, but they only set theirs at 9.2 liang. Compared to the group with a higher production of white waste, they produced 44 jin less per month. From January to July of this year, the group's actual production of white waste was more than 112 jin less than stipulated by the state plan.
    Their significant achievements are mainly due to doing the following: Grasping Ideology, Grasping the Key
    When formulating the group's plan for July of this year, most group members still had conservative ideas. They believed that July was hotter than June, and it was the yellow plum season. Moreover, yellow cotton was mixed into the raw cotton, so the white waste plan should be set higher than in June, otherwise it would not be completed. The group leaders and activists studied this idea. They recalled that when formulating the group's plan for June, some people had also said that the weather was hot, there was yellow cotton, and the work would be difficult, so the white waste plan was set at 11 liang, but the actual output was only 9.2 liang. Therefore, they believed that based on the situation in June, it was possible to complete the advanced indicators with further effort. After the activists unified their thinking, they took the lead in setting advanced indicators at the group meeting and publicized the results of the analysis to the masses. They pointed out that to build socialism, there could be no slackening, and advanced indicators must be set. After discussion, the group members felt that this was very reasonable, so they set the group's white waste indicator at 9.2 liang, which was no more than the previous month.
    After overcoming the group's conservative ideas, they actively sought ways to reduce white waste and promptly corrected various slackening thoughts. The work in July was indeed difficult. The white waste produced in the second half of the night shift was always more than that produced during the day shift. Later, the doffer discovered that Huang Baomei, the group's model worker, did not produce more white waste during the night shift than during the day shift because she concentrated her mind and did not slacken during the night shift, especially in the second half of the night shift, and insisted on implementing the work method. After the doffer discussed this with other activists, they decided to weigh the amount of white waste produced in the first half of the night shift for each person when eating the midnight meal, so that everyone would have a clear idea of their performance. Cao Guiying knew that she had produced 18 liang of white waste in the first half of the night shift, so she worked hard to implement the work method in the second half of the night shift, resulting in only 2 liang of white waste and not affecting the completion of the group's plan.
    Using All Methods to Improve the Group's Technical Level
    In the past, the group's technical level was relatively poor. Whenever the model worker Huang Baomei went out to attend meetings, the group's plan could not be completed. Some people who often failed to complete the plan said to them, "You complete the plan only because of Baomei, right? Once Baomei leaves, you will be the same as us!" Everyone did not pay much attention to this. In the fourth quarter of last year, the machines in the group spinning 42-count yarn always failed to complete the plan until Huang Baomei, who was responsible for spinning 32-count yarn, was transferred to them, and then the plan was completed. Since then, everyone realized that if the technical level of all the group members was not improved, similar situations would occur in the future. Therefore, various methods were adopted to improve technology.
    The first is to study technology regularly. In addition to attending technical classes on time, they also asked Huang Baomei, the model worker, and other comrades with good technology to take turns explaining operating methods based on the problems in the group's production, and then conduct group-based mutual assistance and practice. For example, the machine operators were divided into three mutual assistance groups, with Huang Baomei, the model worker, and Zhao Xiuying, who had better skills, serving as the leaders of the mutual assistance groups. Those with poor skills were taught by those with good skills, and those with average skills observed each other's operations, reported any shortcomings to the mutual assistance group leader, and then the mutual assistance group leader helped them improve.
    The second is to teach and learn comprehensively. The technical level of group members Chen Liansheng and Cao Guiying was relatively poor, and they often failed to complete the plan in the fourth quarter of last year. Chen Liansheng only completed the plan for four or five days a month. After organizing technical learning, Huang Baomei, the model worker, was responsible for helping her. Huang Baomei found that it took her 11 minutes to patrol the machines once and 45 seconds to patch a roving end, and the patching was not good enough, while others only took 3 minutes to patrol once and 15 seconds to patch a roving end. Huang Baomei taught her how to patch the roving end, enabling her to increase her speed to 6 to 7 ends per minute, with fewer breaks. She also taught her how to patrol and reduce missing ends, etc. In this way, her technical level improved significantly. Cao Guiying also improved her technical level with the help of other comrades in the mutual assistance group. In June of this year, both of them received awards.
    The third is to exchange advanced experience in a timely manner. When the group held meetings to check the implementation of the plan, they always asked those who implemented the plan well to introduce their experience, and those who did not implement the plan well to examine their shortcomings, and then everyone would offer suggestions. In this way, the effect of learning from each other's strengths and making up for weaknesses was achieved. For example, on the first night shift in May of this year, the whole group produced 10.8 jin of white waste (the plan was 9.6 jin), and only Huang Baomei and Fan Xiaomei among the 13 machine operators completed their individual plans. When checking the implementation of the plan at the meeting, Fan Xiaomei introduced her experience. The next night shift, after everyone followed Fan Xiaomei's experience, the white waste was reduced to 9 jin, which was 6 liang less than the plan. Another example is that in July of this year, a new batch of spindles was replaced in the workshop. Every time the yarn was doffed, there were always four or five yarns that could not be pulled out, and sometimes the spindles were even broken. Sometimes they had to wait until the machine was running again before pulling them out, and sometimes even if they were pulled out, they would have three or four broken ends. This increased the number of breaks and the amount of white waste, and the doffing time also exceeded the 40 seconds stipulated by the work method. However, the doffer Lu Jiumei doffed very quickly every time. She could pull out the yarns that others could not pull out with one pull. It turned out that when she pulled the yarn, she held the bobbin firmly with one hand and kept the spindle still with the other hand, and a gentle pull would do the trick. The group immediately exchanged Lu Jiumei's method of pulling yarn, and now there are no more yarns that cannot be pulled out.
    As the technical level improved, the number of people completing their individual plans also increased. In February of this year, only 60% of the group completed their individual plans. By June and July, all members of the group were able to complete their individual plans. In September, although the model worker Huang Baomei attended the Shanghai and National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference and was away from the group for a whole month, thanks to everyone's efforts, the advanced group indicators were still fully completed. For example, the plan was to produce 9 liang of white waste, but the actual output was only 8 liang.
    Mutual Assistance and Solidarity, Good Production
    In July of this year, the weather was hot, the work was difficult, and many people were sick. In order to ensure the completion of the group's plan, it was necessary to reduce absenteeism as much as possible; more importantly, it was necessary to have mutual assistance and solidarity. For example, if a machine operator asked for leave, and there were not enough people in the workshop to make adjustments, one person would be drawn from the doffers to help piece the broken ends; when the roving ends were disconnected, the doffers would take the initiative to help the machine operators piece them. Everyone knew that if the broken ends were not pieced well, the amount of white waste would increase, so as long as there was a broken end on the machine, whoever saw it would go to piece it, regardless of who was responsible. They said: Reducing one broken end is reducing one piece of white waste. Another example is that the doffer Chen Genmei had a lot of reactions whenever she was pregnant. She took a full five months of leave when she was pregnant with her first child. When she was pregnant with her second child, thanks to the mutual assistance and friendship of the comrades in the group, who helped her doff and wipe the machine feet, she did not take a single day of leave from pregnancy to delivery. Wang Guiying and Chen Liudi's families had many members and low incomes, and their lives were relatively difficult. The group helped them apply for subsidies from the leadership on the one hand and solved the problem by means of mutual assistance on the other. At the end of last year, Wang Guiying gave birth to a child. The group comrades knew that her family had added a member and that the Spring Festival was approaching, so her life must be difficult. They helped her apply for a subsidy of 30 yuan from the leadership, bought her rice, coal briquettes, etc. In addition, the group members contributed two jiao and three jiao each, and collected more than three yuan to buy her glutinous rice, sesame oil, pancakes, etc., and sent them to her home. Wang Guiying was very moved. Wang Guiying was originally relatively backward and liked to complain. After this factual education, she realized that only life in the new society is guaranteed, so she worked actively and proactively. In July, she not only completed her individual plan but also won an award.
    Urging Administrative Departments to Strengthen Technical Measures
    In May of this year, the phenomenon of steel travelers flying off the machines was very serious. If a steel traveler flew off, it would break at least three yarn ends, resulting in more white waste and increasing the difficulty of piecing the ends. After discussion at the meeting, it was decided to suggest that the administrative department immediately study and deal with it. The administrative department did not solve the problem in time, and the group urged them several times. Finally, after the administrative department's research, the problem of steel travelers flying off was found. The main reason was that the oil line was too tight. After the oil line was loosened, the steel travelers stopped flying off, and the number of broken ends and white waste was reduced.

    一个经常全面完成计划的小组
    张燕如
    国营上海第十七棉纺织厂第二分厂细纱车间乙班第二工区（原第三小组），是上海各纱厂中完成国家计划最好的小组之一。他们经常全面完成国家规定的各项指标，如今年七月份，天气很热，原棉中又掺了部分黄花，断头很多，活难做，但是他们仍能完成先进的小组指标。以出白花为例，计划订得最高的小组每班每台车是十一两，他们只订了九点二两。跟出白花较多的小组比较，一个月就少出四十四斤。今年一月到七月，小组实际出的白花比国家计划规定的少一百一十二斤多。
    他们能有这样显著的成绩，主要是由于做好了以下几件工作：抓思想、抓关键
    在制定今年七月份小组计划的时候，大部分组员还有保守思想，他们认为：七月比六月热，又是黄霉天，原棉中又掺了黄花，白花计划应该比六月份多订些，否则就完不成。小组领导人和积极分子就针对这种思想进行了研究，他们想起：在制定六月份小组计划时，也有人说过天气热，有黄花，活一定难做，把白花计划订为十一两，但实际上只出九点二两。因此，他们认为根据六月份的情况，如果进一步努力，是可以完成先进指标的。积极分子思想统一后，就在小组会上带头订先进指标，并且把分析的结果向群众宣传。指出：要建设社会主义，不能有一点松懈，一定要订先进的指标。小组组员讨论后，觉得很有道理，就订出了九点二两的小组白花指标，并没有比上个月多。
    在克服了小组的保守思想以后，就积极设法减少白花，及时纠正各种松劲思想。七月份的活的确难做。下半夜出的白花总比白天出的多。后来落纱长发现组里劳动模范黄宝妹做夜班出的白花并不比做日班多，原因是她做夜班思想集中，不松劲，特别是做到下半夜更加注意，坚持执行工作法。落纱长同其他积极分子研究后，决定在吃半夜饭的时候给每人磅一磅上半夜所出的白花，使每个人都心中有数。曹桂英知道自己上半夜出了十八两白花，下半夜就抓紧执行工作法，结果只出了二两白花，没有影响全组计划的完成。
    用一切办法提高小组技术水平
    过去，这个小组的技术水平是较差的，一遇到劳动模范黄宝妹到外面去开会，小组计划就完不成。有些经常完不成计划的人对他们说：“你们完成计划还不是都靠宝妹吗？宝妹一走，你们还不是跟我们一样！”大家听了还不十分在意。去年第四季度，小组内纺四十二支纱的车子老完不成计划，直到把负责纺三十二支纱的黄宝妹调去，才完成计划。从此以后，大家才认识到如果不提高小组全体组员的技术水平，将来还会发生类似情况。于是就采用了各种办法来提高技术。
    首先是定期学习技术。她们除按时听技术课外，还根据小组生产中的问题，由劳动模范黄宝妹等技术好的同志轮流讲操作法，然后分组互助实习。如挡车工分成三个互助小组，由劳动模范黄宝妹和技术较好的赵秀英等分别担任互助组组长。技术差的人由技术好的人包教，技术一般的就互相看对方操作，发现缺点向互助组长汇报，再由互助组长帮助提高。
    其次是包教包学。组员陈连生、曹桂英二人的技术水平较差，去年第四季度经常完不成计划。陈连生一个月内只有四、五天完成计划。在组织技术学习以后，就由劳动模范黄宝妹负责帮助她，黄宝妹发现她巡回一次车要十一分钟，镶一个粗纱头要四十五秒，镶得还不够好，而别人巡回一次只要三分钟，镶一个粗纱头只要十五秒。黄宝妹就教她镶粗纱头，使她提高到每分钟能够镶六根到七根，而且很少断头。又教她怎样巡回和减少漏头等。这样，她的技术水平显著提高了。曹桂英也在别的互助组同志的帮助下提高了技术水平。今年六月份，她们两人都得了奖。
    再次是及时交流先进经验。小组开会检查计划执行情况的时候，总要请执行计划比较好的人介绍经验，让计划执行得不好的人检查缺点，然后再由大家提意见。这样，就收到了取长补短的效果。如今年五月份的头一个夜班，全组出了十斤八两白花（计划是九斤六两），十三个挡车工中只有黄宝妹、范小妹两人完成了个人计划。在开会检查计划执行情况的时候，就由范小妹介绍自己的经验。第二天夜班，大家按照范小妹的经验做了以后，白花减少到九斤，比计划还少六两。又如今年七月份车间里换了一批新锭子，每次落纱总有四、五支纱拔不动，有时甚至把锭子拔断，有时只好等到开车后再拔，有时即使拔下来了，也带着三、四根断头。这样就增加断头，多出白花；每次落纱时间也超过工作法规定的四十秒钟。但是，落纱工陆九妹每次落纱都很快，别人拔不动的纱她一拔就拔了下来，原来是她在拔纱的时候一只手捏牢筒管，另一只手使锭子不动，轻轻一拔就成了。小组就马上交流了陆九妹拔纱的方法，现在再也没有拔不下的纱了。
    技术水平提高了，完成个人计划的人数也就多了。今年二月份小组完成个人计划的只有百分之六十，到六、七月份，小组已全部都能完成个人计划。九月份虽然劳动模范黄宝妹出席上海及全国的青年社会主义建设积极分子大会，整整一个月不在小组；但是由于大家的努力，仍然全面完成了先进的小组指标，如计划出白花九两，实际只出八两。
    互助团结，搞好生产
    今年七月份天气热，活难做，害病的人又多，为了保证完成小组计划，必须尽可能地减少缺勤；更重要的是互助团结。例如有的挡车工请假了，车间人少无法调配，就从落纱工中抽出一个人帮助接头；粗纱头脱节的时候，落纱工就主动地帮助挡车工接好。大家都知道断头不接好，白花就会增多，所以只要车上一有断头，谁看见了谁就去接，不分你我。她们说：减少一根断头，就是减少一朵白花。又如落纱工陈根妹每当怀孕的时候反应都很大。她怀第一个孩子，足足请了五个多月的假，当她怀第二个孩子的时候，由于小组同志发扬互助友爱，帮助她落纱，揩车脚，她从怀孕到生产，没有请过一次假。王桂英、陈留弟二人家里人口多，收入少，生活比较困难。小组内一方面帮她们向领导上申请补助，一方面以互助办法来解决。去年年底，王桂英生小孩，小组同志知道她家中添了人，又快过春节了，生活一定有困难，就帮助她向领导上申请补助三十元，替她买了大米、煤球等，另外，小组中你二角我三角地又凑了三元多钱替她买了糯米、麻油、大饼等，送到她家中，王桂英很感动。王桂英原来是比较落后的，爱发牢骚，经过这次事实教育，她认识到只有新社会生活才有保障，因此工作积极、主动了，七月份不但完成了个人计划，还得了奖。
    督促行政部门加强技术措施
    今年五月份，车子上飞钢丝圈现象很严重。一只钢丝圈飞起来了，起码打断三根纱头，结果就多出白花，增加接头的困难。大家开会讨论后，决定建议行政部门马上研究处理。行政部门没有及时给解决，小组又督促了几次，最后经行政部门研究，终于找出飞钢丝圈的毛病，主要是由于油线太紧。把油线放松后，钢丝圈就不飞了，断头、白花也就减少了。
