Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 1st (TASS dispatch) - Argentine newspapers have published summaries of the Argentine Communist Party's statement on the coup d'état that occurred in Argentina on September 16th. The statement pointed out that this was a military coup instigated by the large landowner groups, big business owners, upper echelons of the church, and American imperialism. The statement said that the actions of the military have now ended victoriously, but the slogan of democratic cooperation remains on the agenda because implementing such a policy can prevent one dictatorship from replacing another, and allow Argentinians to solve their own problems in accordance with the interests of the people, free from foreign interference. The statement pointed out that people with various tendencies are participating in the victorious policy, including democratic and progressive elements who support national independence and advocate the protection of national natural resources, as well as reactionary forces who are pressuring the government to subordinate itself to the church. The statement said that democratic forces must try to get the new government to lift martial law, abolish anti-democratic laws and decrees, guarantee democratic freedoms and the activities of political parties, implement school education separated from the church, sign an agreement with the church based on the separation of church and state, and pursue a foreign policy of peaceful and friendly coexistence with all peoples. The statement emphasized that the implementation of these minimal measures will enable the country to establish a democratic regime and prevent new coups. Otherwise, the country cannot have political stability.

    阿根廷共产党就阿根廷政变发表声明
    新华社四日讯　据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯一日讯：阿根廷各报刊载了阿根廷共产党就九月十六日在阿根廷发生的政变发表的声明的摘要。声明指出，这是一次军事政变，是大地主集团、大企业家、教会上层分子和美帝国主义策动的。声明说，现在军人的行动已经胜利地结束了，但是民主合作的口号仍然留在日程上，因为执行这样的一种政策能够防止以一个独裁统治来代替另一个独裁统治，使阿根廷人在不受外国干涉的情况下按照人民的利益解决他们自己的问题。声明指出，在取得胜利的政策中有各种不同倾向的人参加，包括拥护民族独立和主张保护国家天然资源的民主和进步分子，也包括正在对政府施加压力使它从属于教会的反动力量。声明说，民主力量必须设法使新政府取消国内戒严，废除反民主的法律和命令，保证民主自由和政党的活动，实行和教会分离的学校教育，同教会签订一项以教会同国家分离为基础的协议，奉行同各国人民和平友好相处的外交政策，举行普选。声明强调说，实行这些起码的措施将使国家有可能建立民主的政权和防止新的政变。不然，国家就不可能有政治上的稳定。
