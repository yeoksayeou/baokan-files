    Important Recommendations for Safeguarding European Security

    The Foreign Ministers' Conference of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States began discussing European security and the German question on October 28th. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov presented a proposal on the basic principles of an all-European treaty on collective security; British Foreign Secretary Macmillan, representing the Western three powers, put forward a proposal for "restoring German unity and security." From the proposals of the Soviet Union and the Western three powers, one can see two different directions of effort: the Soviet proposal aims to have all European countries work together to ensure collective European security; while the Western three powers' proposal aims to strengthen existing military blocs in Europe. There is no doubt that, among the above-mentioned proposals, only the Soviet proposal is in line with the interests of all countries, large and small, in safeguarding European security, and is in line with the "Geneva spirit" of the Four Power Heads of Government Conference.

    Establishing a European collective security system involving all European countries and the United States, with China participating as an observer, is the most reliable way to ensure European security and consolidate world peace. For several years, the Western countries' policy of military blocs has caused serious unrest in the world. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western European Union, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact Organization, etc., are deepening international antagonism and distrust everywhere in Europe, Asia, and Africa, increasing the people's economic burden, and subjecting the people to the threat of a new war. Moreover, because Western countries have established military blocs against other European countries, mutually opposed military blocs have emerged in Europe. This situation makes the Soviet proposal particularly significant and urgent. Historical experience has repeatedly proven that the policy of establishing military blocs can only lead Europe and the whole world to the abyss of war. Therefore, replacing the existing mutually opposed military blocs with a European collective security system can not only eliminate the threat of a new war in Europe, but also make a great contribution to safeguarding world peace.

    The Soviet proposal for establishing an all-European collective security system is deeply popular. The peace-loving people of all countries are increasingly supporting the idea of European collective security. Many Asian, African, and European countries, for the sake of their own national independence and development, oppose the policy of creating divisive military blocs and advocate peaceful coexistence. These propositions are fully in line with the spirit of the Soviet Union in establishing an all-European collective security system.

    It should be pointed out that there are great difficulties in establishing European collective security: Western countries are unwilling to abandon the military blocs they have established. In response to this situation, the Soviet proposal advocates implementing the establishment of European collective security in two stages. In the first stage, countries do not have to解除[jiěchú: remove, relieve] the obligations they have undertaken under existing treaties and agreements (referring to the obligations undertaken by members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union, as well as members of the Warsaw Treaty), but they should guarantee to renounce the use of force and resolve all disputes that may arise between them through peaceful means. In the second stage, the obligations undertaken under the European security treaty will take full effect, and the existing treaties and agreements will cease to be effective, and the military blocs established under them will be abolished. It can be seen from this that the Soviet proposal, on the one hand, will guarantee the establishment of genuine European collective security, and on the other hand, it also takes into account the fact that opposing military blocs currently exist in Europe. This proposal will obviously help to bring views closer together on this issue, and once this proposal is accepted, it can guarantee the peaceful coexistence of European countries.

    The Soviet proposal can not only gradually eliminate opposing military blocs, but also eliminate the causes of the division of Germany, thereby helping to promote the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. The Soviet proposal stipulates that the two Germanies should jointly participate in the European collective security system before German reunification to facilitate their mutual rapprochement, which is the most realistic way to unify Germany under the current conditions.

    The establishment of European collective security will fundamentally change the situation in Europe and will also be a major step in strengthening mutual trust and cooperation between countries, especially between major powers. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out in his speech at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on October 28th: "Only when the countries concerned, especially the major powers, take joint action to maintain European peace, can the arms race be ended, international tensions eased, and trust established in international relations. Without such trust, the people of all countries cannot rest assured about their tomorrow." Therefore, the Soviet proposal on establishing a European collective security system is precisely to promote the "Geneva spirit" and promote the resolution of other major outstanding international issues.

    As for the Western three powers' proposal for "restoring German unity and security," it has nothing in common with the goal of safeguarding European security, and it is a retreat from the position of the agreements reached at the Geneva Conference of the Four Heads of Government. The Four Heads of Government, in their instructions to the Foreign Ministers, clearly placed the issue of European security first, and pointed out that "the resolution of the German question and the work of reunifying Germany through free elections should be carried out in a manner consistent with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security." However, the Western three powers' proposal subordinates the issue of European security to the resolution of the issue of German reunification. As is known, as a result of the Western countries' ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements, serious obstacles have been created for the issue of restoring German reunification. Under these circumstances, the Western three powers' foreign ministers' violation of the spirit of the instructions of the Four Heads of Government in putting forward the above-mentioned proposal cannot but be considered an attempt to create difficulties for the discussions at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    The Western three powers' proposal reduces the issue of establishing European collective security to merely providing "security guarantees" to the Soviet Union. Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin once said at the Four Power Heads of Government Conference on this point: "The proposal for guarantees is perfectly understandable in the case of small countries that do not have the ability to defend themselves militarily. But here we are talking about guarantees to the Soviet Union, and it is quite clear that any proposal in this regard has no basis whatsoever to stand on." In order to achieve this unfounded "guarantee," the Western three powers' proposal put forward restrictions and supervision of armaments. However, as is known, such restrictions and supervision have never prevented the countries of the Western European Union from implementing unlimited arms expansion. Therefore, this kind of talk by Western countries cannot even be said to provide any guarantee for the security of the Soviet Union and other European countries.

    The proposal also stipulates that a unified Germany must participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union. This proves that it is not for the purpose of safeguarding European security, but to strengthen and expand the military bloc against other European countries. The Western three powers' proposal stipulates that a unified Germany must join the above-mentioned two military blocs, that is, to take a unified Germany as a tool against other European countries. This approach can only lead to a sharper European situation and an escalation of international tensions.

    The Western three powers' proposal is also very detrimental to the cause of restoring German reunification. According to that proposal, Germany must achieve reunification on the basis of the Paris Agreements, which is to re-militarize the whole of Germany. This is against the will of the entire German people. German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl has repeatedly pointed out: "The attempt to subordinate a unified Germany to the Paris Agreements and drag it into the North Atlantic Treaty is completely unacceptable to the German people." The people and broad public of West Germany are also increasingly firmly opposed to the policy of participating in military blocs, and demand the abolition of the Paris Agreements to eliminate the obstacles to realizing German reunification. The reunification of Germany is primarily a matter for the German people themselves, and this task cannot be accomplished without the consent of the German people and their own efforts.

    The Chinese people fully support the Soviet Union's proposal on the basic principles of the "All-European Treaty on Collective Security." This is a proposal that concerns the vital interests of people all over the world. No matter how Western propagandists embellish the Western proposals and try to obliterate the Soviet proposals, the people have seen that the West is using the empty words of "security guarantees" to cover up their essence of wanting to expand military blocs. The people believe that the Soviet proposal is a true touchstone. Solving problems based on this proposal is the demand of all peace-loving people.

### 保障欧洲安全的重要建议

    保障欧洲安全的重要建议
    法、英、苏、美四国外长会议已于十月二十八日开始讨论欧洲安全和德国问题。苏联外长莫洛托夫在会议上提出了关于欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的基本原则的建议；英国外交大臣麦克米伦代表西方三国提出了“恢复德国统一和安全”的建议。从苏联和西方三国的建议中，人们可看到两种不同的努力方向：苏联建议的目的是使所有欧洲国家一致努力来保障欧洲的集体安全；而西方三国的建议则是为了加强欧洲现有的军事集团。毫无疑问，在上述的两种建议中，只有苏联的建议才符合于一切大小国家要求保障欧洲安全的利益，符合于四国政府首脑会议的“日内瓦精神”。
    建立所有欧洲国家和美国参加，并且有中国的观察员参加的欧洲集体安全体系，是保障欧洲安全和巩固世界和平的最可靠的办法。几年以来，西方国家的军事集团政策已经给世界造成了严重不安。北大西洋集团、西欧联盟、东南亚集团和巴格达条约集团等等正在欧洲、亚洲和非洲到处加深国际间的对立和不信任，加重人民的经济负担，并且使人民生活在新战争的威胁下面。而且，由于西方国家建立了反对其他欧洲国家的军事集团，从而在欧洲出现了互相对立的军事集团。这种情况就使苏联的建议尤其有着迫切的重大意义。历史的经验已经一再证明，建立军事集团的政策只能把欧洲以及全世界引向战争的深渊。因此，用欧洲集体安全体系来代替现有的互相对立的军事集团，不但可以消除欧洲的新战争威胁，并且对于保障世界和平也是一个极大的贡献。
    苏联关于建立全欧集体安全体系的建议深得人心。各国爱好和平人民越来越强烈地支持欧洲集体安全的思想。许多亚洲、非洲和欧洲国家为了自己国家的独立和发展都反对制造分裂的军事集团政策，主张和平共处。这些主张同苏联建立全欧集体安全体系的精神是完全一致的。
    应当指出，在建立欧洲集体安全的道路上存在着很大的困难：西方国家不愿意放弃它们所建立的军事集团。针对着这种情况，苏联的建议中主张把欧洲集体安全的建立分两个阶段逐步实行。在第一个阶段，各国不必解除它们根据现有的条约和协定所承担的义务（这里指的是北大西洋集团和西欧联盟的成员国，以及华沙条约成员国所承担的义务），但是它们应保证放弃使用武力，并通过和平的办法来解决它们之间可能发生的一切争执。在第二个阶段内，根据欧洲安全条约所承担的义务就将完全生效，而现有的条约和协定就将停止生效，根据它们而建立的军事集团将被取消。由此可见，苏联的建议一方面将保证建立真正的欧洲集体安全，另一方面也考虑到了欧洲现在存在着对立的军事集团的这个事实。这个建议显然将有助大家在这个问题上的观点的接近，并且在一旦这个建议被接受的时候，就可以保证欧洲国家的和平共处。
    苏联的建议不但可以逐步取消对立的军事集团，并且也将消除分裂德国的起因，从而有助于促进德国在和平民主的基础上恢复统一。苏联的建议规定，让两个德国在德国统一之前共同参加欧洲集体安全体系，以便利它们相互之间的接近，这是在目前条件之下统一德国的最现实的道路。
    建立欧洲集体安全将根本改变欧洲的局势，并且也是加强国与国间，特别是大国之间的互信合作的重大的一步。莫洛托夫外长十月二十八日在四国外长会议上的发言中指出：“只有有关国家，首先是大国对维护欧洲和平采取共同行动，才能结束扩军，缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际关系中的信任，如果没有这种信任，各国人民对他们的明天就不能放心。”因此，苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，正是为了促进“日内瓦精神”，促进其他悬而未决的重大的国际问题的解决。
    至于西方三国所提出的“恢复德国统一和安全”的建议，不但与保障欧洲安全的目的毫无共同之处，而且是从四国政府首脑日内瓦会议所取得的协议的立场上后退了。四国政府首脑在给外交部长们的指示中，曾明确地把欧洲安全问题列在首位，并且指出“德国问题的解决和通过自由选举重新统一德国的工作应该在符合于德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益的情况下进行”。但是，西方三国的建议却把欧洲安全问题从属于德国统一问题的解决。而人们知道，由于西方国家批准和实施巴黎协定的结果，已为恢复德国统一的问题造成了严重的障碍。在这种情况下，西方三国外长违反四国政府首脑的指示的精神而提出上述的建议，就不能不令人认为是企图给四国外长会议的讨论制造困难。
    西方三国的建议把建立欧洲集体安全的问题归结为只是向苏联提供“安全保证”的问题。对于这一点苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在四国政府首脑会议上就曾经说过：“如果就没有能力在军事上保卫自己的弱小国家而言，关于保证的建议是完全可以理解的。而这里谈的是对苏联的保证，十分清楚，这方面的任何建议都是没有丝毫根据可以成立的。”西方三国的建议为了实现这种毫无根据的“保证”而提出了军备的限制和监督。但是，人们知道，这种限制和监督从来没有妨碍西欧联盟的国家无限制地实行扩充军备。因此，西方国家的这种谈论甚至根本说不上对苏联和其他欧洲国家的安全有任何保障。
    这个建议还规定统一的德国要参加北大西洋组织和西欧联盟。这就证明它不是为了保障欧洲的安全，而是为了要加强和扩大反对欧洲其他国家的军事集团。西方三国的建议规定统一的德国必须加入上述的两个军事集团，也就是说要把统一了的德国拿来做为反对欧洲其他国家的工具。这种做法只能导致欧洲局势的更加尖锐化和国际局势的加剧紧张。
    西方三国的建议对于恢复德国统一的事业也是十分不利的。根据那个建议，德国必须在巴黎协定的基础上实现统一，也就是要使整个德国重新军国主义化。这是违反全体德国人民的意志的。德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥早已一再指出：“打算把统一的德国从属于巴黎协定和把它拖入北大西洋公约的企图是德国人民完全不能接受的”。西德人民和广泛公众也越来越坚决地反对参加军事集团的政策，要求废除巴黎协定来消除实现德国统一的障碍。统一德国主要是德国人民自己的事，没有德国人民的同意和他们自己的努力，这个任务是不可能实现的。
    中国人民完全支持苏联“关于欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”基本原则的建议。这是一个有关全世界人民的切身利益的建议。不管西方宣传家怎样粉饰西方的建议而企图抹煞苏联的建议，人民已经看到西方是在用“安全保证”的空字眼来掩盖他们想扩大军事集团的实质。人民认为苏联的建议是真正的试金石。根据这个建议来解决问题是一切爱好和平人民的主张。
