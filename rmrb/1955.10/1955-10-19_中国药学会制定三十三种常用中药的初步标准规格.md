    The Chinese Pharmaceutical Association formulates preliminary standard specifications for thirty-three commonly used Chinese medicines
    The Chinese Medicine Compilation Committee of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association has formulated preliminary standard specifications for thirty-three commonly used Chinese medicines. By the end of this year, it will continue to formulate standard specifications for sixty commonly used Chinese medicines.
    There are more than 1,800 kinds of Chinese medicines. The Chinese Medicine Compilation Committee has determined that there are 252 kinds of commonly used Chinese medicines for which preliminary standard specifications will be formulated, including Eucommia ulmoides and Dichroa febrifuga. This work will be completed in three to five years, and finally, a preliminary standard draft of commonly used and effective Chinese medicines will be compiled.
    The Chinese Medicine Compilation Committee has held more than 20 symposiums on standard specifications for Chinese medicines, with the participation of people from the Chinese and Western medical communities and various aspects of Chinese medicine production, sales, supply, and management to discuss issues such as drug quality, clinical application effects, market specifications, production and sales conditions, and unified nomenclature.
    Local branches of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association are actively collecting local medicinal plant specimens, and have now sent more than 200 collected specimens and opinions from local traditional Chinese medicine circles to the Chinese Medicine Compilation Committee as information for formulating preliminary standard specifications for commonly used Chinese medicines.
    Currently, the proportion of patients treated with Chinese medicine accounts for 80% of the patients nationwide. Before liberation, because there were no unified standard specifications for Chinese medicines, the phenomenon of merchants passing off fakes as genuine and inferior products as superior ones was very common. The formulation of preliminary standard specifications for commonly used Chinese medicines will be of great benefit to improving medical effects and improving the production, supply, and management of Chinese medicines, and will lay the foundation for further research on Chinese medicines.

    中国药学会制定三十三种常用中药的初步标准规格
    中国药学会中药整理委员会已制定三十三种常用中药的初步标准规格，到今年年底将继续制定六十种常用中药的标准规格。
    中药共有一千八百多种。中药整理委员会确定制定初步标准规格的常用中药计有杜仲、常山等二百五十二种，这项工作将在三、五年内完成，最后将编成常用有效中药初步标准草案。
    中药整理委员会已举行了二十多次中药标准规格座谈会，有中、西医药界和有关中药产销、供应、管理各方面的人员参加，讨论了药物品质、临床应用效果、市场规格、产销情况和统一名称等问题。
    中国药学会各地分会积极采集当地药用植物标本，现在已将采集的二百多种标本和当地中医中药界的意见送到中药整理委员会，作为制定常用中药初步标准规格的资料。
    目前，全国用中药治病的占全国病人的百分之八十。解放前因为没有统一的中药标准规格，药商中以假冒真，以劣充优的现象很普遍。常用中药初步标准规格的制定工作对提高医疗效果和改善中药的生产供应及管理都将有很大好处，并给进一步研究中药工作奠定了基础。（新华社）
