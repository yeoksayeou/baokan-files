    Longyan Iron Mine contains a large amount of iron sand, with a considerable number of thin seams within it. Previously, the mine only extracted thick seams, discarding many thin seams, which caused a great loss of national underground resources. At the end of August this year, following the advice of Soviet experts, they began trial mining of thin seams. After a month of trial mining, it was proven that thin seams could not only be mined, but also with considerable efficiency. A mining team newly established in Pit No. 1 of this mine created a new team record of 71 tons of daily output on October 8.

    龙烟铁矿试采薄矿层成功
    龙烟铁矿储藏着大量的铁砂中，里面有相当数量的薄矿层。以前，这个矿只采厚矿层，丢弃了许多薄矿层，使国家地下资源受到了很大的损失。今年八月底，接受了苏联专家的建议，开始试采薄矿层，经过一个月的试采，证明薄矿层不仅能采，而且效率不低。这个矿一坑新成立的一个采矿队，在十月八日这天创造了日产七十一吨的小组新纪录。
