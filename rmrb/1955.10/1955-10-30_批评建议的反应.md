Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    A letter from the Supervisory Office of the Ministry of Textile Industry: The "Reader's Letters" page on August 3rd published a letter criticizing "Tens of Thousands of Jin of Waste Cotton Were Buried." After our work team, together with relevant authorities, conducted an inspection, it was proven that this criticism was correct. The Northeast Textile Industry Bureau made a self-criticism regarding this incident and put forward suggestions for improving the work of the Jiamusi Textile Factory. Factory Director Ma Zhennong was demoted; First Deputy Factory Director Fan Lun was dismissed; Sun Bojun, the head of the Raw Materials and Finished Products Section (mistakenly referred to as the "Cost Section" in the original criticism), was dismissed and will be prosecuted according to the law.
    The Longfeng Mine of the Fushun Mining Bureau wrote to accept the criticism on the "Reader's Letters" page of September 28th. They examined the causes of the overtime work phenomenon and proposed measures to change this situation.
    A letter from the Jilin Provincial Federation of Trade Unions: The letter "Attention Must Be Paid to the Custody of Confidential Documents" published on the "Reader's Letters" page on September 18th revealed the phenomenon of our organization not paying enough attention to confidentiality work. This is consistent with the facts. We have already convened a staff meeting to conduct confidentiality education, and the personnel involved have also been criticized. It should be noted that the document lost by Comrade Li Shijie of the Capital Construction Office mentioned in the original letter of criticism was actually lost by Comrade Li Lin.
    After the "Reader's Letters" page of June 26th criticized Qin Shoufa, the office director of the First Mechanical and Electrical Installation Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, for taking advantage of public property, the Party Committee of this company conducted an inspection and proved that the situation revealed by the readers was completely true. Qin Shoufa has already made a self-criticism and will repay the borrowed public funds in installments.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    纺织工业部监察室来信：八月三日“读者来信专页”发表了“成万斤废棉被埋掉了”的批评信。经我们派工作组会同有关机关进行检查，证明这个批评是正确的。东北纺织工业管理局对这个事件作了检讨，并且对佳木斯纺织厂的工作提出了改进意见。厂长马振农受到降职处分；第一副厂长范伦受到撤职处分；原料成品科（原批评中误为“成本科”）科长孙伯君受到撤职处分，并将予以法办。
    抚顺矿务局龙凤矿来信接受九月二十八日“读者来信专页”的批评，他们检查了造成加班加点现象的原因，并提出了改变这种状况的措施。
    吉林省工会联合会来信：九月十八日“读者来信专页”发表的“必须注意保管机要文件”的来信中，揭发了我们机关不重视保密工作的现象。这是符合事实的。我们已经召开了工作人员大会来进行保密教育，有关人员也已经受到了批评。应该说明，原批评信中提到的基本建设办公室李世杰同志丢的那份文件，实际上是李霖同志丢的。
    六月二十六日“读者来信专页”批评了建筑工程部第一机电安装工程公司办公室主任秦守法占公家便宜的行为后，这个公司的党委会已经进行了检查，证明读者揭发的情况完全真实。秦守法已经作了检讨，并将分期付还借支的公款。
