The place called Marizhao in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture had just begun its work when an Yi girl named A Jiao was transferred here to establish a national elementary school and spread the seeds of culture. A Jiao was a graduate of Xichang Normal School. When she first arrived in Marizhao, people had great doubts about her. Some closed their doors or ran away when they saw her coming, and wouldn't even sell her firewood.

"The Yi people's doubts are the result of thousands of years of reactionary rule. As long as we deeply publicize the policies of the Party and the government, unite the upper class, and mingle with the Yi people to gain their support, we can gain a foothold and run the school." This was the working path the Party pointed out for A Jiao.

Later, after A Jiao patiently discussed with a headman named Ma Hei, the headman allowed a livestock pen to be divided in half, one half for livestock and the other for A Jiao to live in. Ma Hei's wife had died several years ago, leaving behind three children who he couldn't take care of alone. The children were as dirty as little mud men, and their clothes were ragged and never mended. The day after A Jiao moved in, she became familiar with the three children, washing their faces and feet, mending their clothes, and leading them to sing mountain songs. The children all called her "Limu A Jiao (Sister A Jiao)."

Just as the wife of the Ma Hei chieftain, Shama Luoluo, was ill, A Jiao went to visit her, helping to care for the patient and sewing clothes for the Ma Hei chieftain. The chieftain said gratefully, "You are too good, better than my own daughter!" When the Yi people nearby became ill, A Jiao also took care of them, washing their clothes and sweeping the floor for them. In the winter of 1953, the people's government distributed cloth for winter clothing to the Yi people, but the people here didn't know how to sew. A Jiao taught them and even sewed eighteen sets for them overnight. In this way, A Jiao gained the support of more and more people. Slowly, people began to send their children to school. As the number of students increased, there was no place to stay at night, so A Jiao and the children crowded in the "? Zhuang" to spend the night. Headman Ma Hei A He vacated a floor of the bunker, which he never allowed outsiders to enter, to use as a storage room for the school, and Jiabayu also gave up part of his bedroom to the school to use as a kitchen. In the summer of 1953, when the Yi people nearby learned that school buildings were going to be built, the headmen automatically helped the school buy wood, and more than 20 Yi families donated grass for the roof, and more than 100 Yi people volunteered to help the school, building the roof, tying grass, and moving grass.

The school was established, and the number of students increased to more than 30. At first, the students were not used to school life and often ran home. At this time, A Jiao was very concerned about the students' lives. She mended and washed their clothes for them, gave them her cotton clothes to wear when it was cold, covered them with quilts, and took care of them day and night when they were sick. Once, several students suddenly had headaches and vomiting at the same time. There was no medicine at the time, so A Jiao wiped their bodies all night, fed them boiled water, made a fire, and comforted them. The students said with emotion, "The teacher is better than our parents."

Seeing that the children had a deep affection for the teachers, A Jiao further cultivated the students' interest in learning. According to the characteristics of Yi children who like to sing and dance, she taught them to sing and dance. The children liked to play with small stones, so she used small stones to teach them to spell words. A Jiao carried out political education by teaching songs. When teaching the lyrics of "The East is Red," she combined it with local events such as distributing farm tools and running schools to educate the children. The children said with emotion, "We must study hard, so that we can write a letter to Chairman Mao in the future." A Jiao took this opportunity to inspire the students to make four learning covenants. From then on, she began formal classroom teaching for the students.

When A Jiao and the teachers came into contact with the headmen and parents, they told them about the students' progress. They were very happy to hear that the students were doing well. Some even said to their children, "You must study hard. I will find money to order newspapers for you, buy pens and paper for you to write."

In order to choose teaching materials that were in line with the local situation and suitable for the students' interests, A Jiao and the teachers often worked until late at night before going to bed. The school lacked teaching aids and furniture. There were no classrooms, desks, or benches, so they held classes under the trees on the hillside. There were no sports equipment, so they made balls out of wood shavings and wooden spinning tops for the children to play with. There were no clocks, so they used dried corn tassels to braid into strips and burn them to tell the time. In the past two years, the students have made significant progress. The students said, "If you don't learn Chairman Mao's principles, you are like a fool, and if you don't learn words, you are like a blind person." Second-grade students can now calculate addition and subtraction of hundreds and unit multiplication and division, and can write simple articles and letters in the new Yi language.

In recent years, A Jiao has been working in a difficult environment under the correct leadership of the Party and the cultivation of the Youth League. She joined the Youth League in 1954 and gloriously joined the Communist Party of China in July 1955. (Xinhua News Agency)

    大凉山上的文化播种人
    凉山彝族自治州的马日脚这块地方刚刚开展工作，就调来一位名叫阿角的彝族姑娘来这里创办一所民族小学，传播文化的种籽。阿角是西昌师范学校毕业的学生。她才到马日脚时人们对她存在着很大的疑虑，有的见她来了就关门或跑了，也不卖柴给她烧。
    “彝民的疑虑是千百年反动统治造成的后果，只要深入宣传党和政府的政策，团结好上层，和彝民群众打成一片，取得群众支持，就能站住脚，就能把学校办起来。”这是党指给阿角的一条工作道路。
    后来，阿角同一个叫马黑的头人耐心商量后，这个头人允许把一所牲畜圈隔成两半，一半拦牲畜，一半给阿角住。马黑在几年前死了妻子，丢下三个儿女，一个人照看不过来。孩子脏得像小泥人，衣服破烂了从来没人给缝补。阿角住下的第二天，就和三个孩子混熟了，给孩子们洗脸洗脚，洗补衣服，领着他们唱山歌。孩子们都叫她“立木阿角（阿角姐）”。
    正当马黑土司的老婆沙马罗罗有病的时候，阿角便去看望她，帮助护理病人，还为马黑土司缝补衣服。土司感激地说：“你太好了，比自己的女儿还好！”附近的彝民有了病，阿角也照样去护理他们，为他们洗衣服、扫地。一九五三年冬，人民政府发给彝民做寒衣的布，可是这里的人都不会缝，阿角就教他们，还连夜为他们赶缝了十八套。阿角就这样得到越来越多的人的拥护，慢慢地有人把子弟送来上学了，学生多了晚间没有住宿的地方，阿角就带着孩子们挤在“?庄”里过夜。头人马黑阿和把从来不让外人进去的碉堡腾出一层来做学校的储藏室，嘉巴尤也把卧室让出一部分给学校作厨房。一九五三年夏天，附近彝民知道要兴建校舍，头人们就自动帮助学校买木料，还有二十多户彝民捐助盖屋顶的草，一百多个彝民为学校义务帮工，盖房顶、扎草、搬草。
    学校建立起来了，学生也随着增加到三十多个。学生起初都过不惯学校生活，常跑回家去。阿角这时对学生们的生活非常关心。给他们补洗衣服，天气冷了，拿自己的棉衣给他们穿，拿被子给他们盖，有病时，白天黑夜地照料他们。一次，突然几个学生一齐头痛呕吐，当时没有药，阿角就整夜地给他们擦身，喂开水，烧火，安慰他们。学生们感动地说：“老师比爹妈还好。”
    阿角看到孩子们对教师有了深厚的感情，就进一步培养学生的学习兴趣。她根据彝族儿童喜欢唱歌跳舞的特点，就教他们唱歌跳舞。孩子们爱耍小石子，就用小石子教他们摆字。阿角通过教歌来进行政治教育，教“东方红”的歌词时，她就结合当地发农具、办学校等事情来教育孩子们。孩子们感动地说：“我们一定要努力学习，将来能写封信给毛主席才对。”阿角趁这个时机启发学生订了四条学习公约，从此，便对学生开始了正规的课堂教学。
    阿角和教师们在和头人、家长接触的时候，就把学生的进步情况告诉他们。他们听见学生成绩好都很喜欢。有的还对自己子女说：“你们好好学习，我背石灰瓦都要找钱来给你们订报纸看，买笔买纸来写字。”
    阿角和教师们为了选择切合当地情况和适合学生兴趣的教材，经常工作到深夜才睡。学校的教具、家具都很缺乏，没有教室、桌凳，他们就在山坡上的树下上课，没有运动器具，他们就用木刨花扎成球，用木材做木转转来给孩子们玩。没有时钟，就用晒干的玉米须子编成条辫燃烧记时。两年来，学生有了显著的进步。学生说：“毛主席的道理不学就傻子样，文字不学就瞎子样。”二年级的学生现在已能算百位数加减法和单位乘除法，能用新彝文写简单的文章和信件了。
    这几年来，阿角得到党的正确领导，得到团的培养，在艰苦的环境里工作着。她在一九五四年加入了青年团，一九五五年七月光荣地加入了中国共产党。　（新华社）
