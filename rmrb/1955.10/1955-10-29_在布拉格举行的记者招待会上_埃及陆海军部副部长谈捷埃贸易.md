Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 28th. Egyptian Deputy Minister of Land and Naval Warfare, General Hassani Ragab, who is currently visiting Czechoslovakia, said at a press conference in Prague on the 27th that Czechoslovakia and Egypt are setting "a moderate and practical example that other countries can emulate, demonstrating that coexistence in our world is not such a difficult thing to achieve after all."

Ragab said that Egypt often buys goods from other countries, but these countries do not buy a corresponding amount of Egyptian goods, resulting in a trade deficit.

He said, "The People's Democracies are currently offering Egypt better payment terms and higher prices." Ragab praised the quality of Czechoslovak goods.

Referring to the deal in which Egypt exchanged cotton for arms from Czechoslovakia, he said: "Egypt needs these arms to maintain its freedom and independence. We need arms for self-defense. Egypt needs arms to maintain peace, not for war."

Ragab said that before reaching an arms deal with the Czech side, Egypt had tried to obtain arms "through traditional channels." These arms could only be delivered under conditions that Egypt considered humiliating. Czechoslovakia, on the other hand, agreed to supply arms unconditionally.

Speaking about his impressions of Czechoslovakia, Ragab said, "I am deeply impressed by the great progress made by the Czechoslovak people in all activities."

    在布拉格举行的记者招待会上
    埃及陆海军部副部长谈捷埃贸易
    新华社布拉格二十八日电　目前正在捷克斯洛伐克访问的埃及陆海军部副部长哈萨尼·拉加布将军二十七日在布拉格举行的记者招待会上说，捷克斯洛伐克和埃及正在树立“一个可为其他国家所效法的适度而实际的榜样，说明共处在我们的世界中毕竟不是一种非常难以实现的事”。
    拉加布说，埃及经常在其他国家中购买货物，但是这些国家没有购买相应数量的埃及货物，因而导致了贸易的入超。
    他说，“人民民主国家目前正在向埃及提供较好的支付条件和较高的价格。”拉加布称赞捷克斯洛伐克货物的质量。
    他在提到埃及向捷克斯洛伐克以棉花换取军火的交易时说：“埃及需要这种军火以便维护它的自由和独立。我们需要军火进行自卫。埃及需要军火维护和平而不是为了战争。”
    拉加布说，在和捷方达成军火交易之前，埃及曾设法“通过传统的途径”得到军火。这些军火只有在埃及认为耻辱的条件下才能运来。而捷克斯洛伐克同意无条件供应军火。
    拉加布在谈到他对捷克斯洛伐克的印象时说，“捷克斯洛伐克人民在一切活动方面所取得的巨大进展使我深受感动”。
