Latin American Countries Demand Expansion of International Trade
Qin Benli

As the international situation eases, the movement of the public in Latin American countries to strive for expanded trade relations with peaceful and democratic countries is constantly rising.

As Brazil's "Workers' Voice" recently pointed out: "Now, the majority of industrialists and businessmen across the country, as well as many large landowners, are demanding the restoration of relations with the Soviet Union. They advocate a new policy towards the socialist camp countries. They see the growing difficulties of the national economy under the control of American monopoly capital. Because American monopoly capital is imposing its will for its own benefit, it is pushing the country towards complete bankruptcy." This is not just the economic situation of Brazil alone; other Latin American countries are also suffering the same difficulties. The opinion of Brazil's "Workers' Voice" represents the common demand of Latin American countries.

The United States' trade situation with Latin American countries in 1954 shows that, in an attempt to prevent the approaching economic crisis, American monopoly capital is shifting its burden onto the people of Latin American countries. On the one hand, the United States reduces imports from Latin American countries, and on the other hand, it dumps American "surplus" goods into these countries.

For example, American monopoly organizations control the sales market of thirteen coffee-producing countries in Latin America. In February of this year, the United States deliberately reduced imports, forcing these countries to further cut coffee export prices. According to Chile's "Our Times" magazine, the price reduction caused Colombia's coffee production to suffer losses of 400 million US dollars. Such losses severely undermine the economic foundations of these countries. Because coffee is the main export item of Latin American countries: coffee and cotton accounted for 81 percent of Brazil's total exports in the first half of 1954; coffee accounted for more than 80 percent of Colombia's exports, 76 percent for Guatemala, 88 percent for El Salvador, and 50 percent for Nicaragua.

The difficulties encountered in Cuba's sugar export trade are also a typical example. 75 percent of Cuba's exports are sugar. About half of this is shipped to the United States. In 1951, the United States raised sugar prices due to demand. After Cuba's sugar industry increased production due to rising prices, the United States has drastically reduced purchases in recent years, pushing prices to a very low level. From mid-1951 to 1954, the price of Cuban sugar fell by 56 percent. Under pressure from the United States, unsold Cuban sugar increased 3.6 times in 1954 alone, resulting in a loss of 100 million US dollars.

On the other hand, Latin American countries are forced to lower import taxes, allowing American "surplus" goods to flood the markets of these countries. The Colombian government exempted import taxes on 300 kinds of American industrial products last year, many of which compete with commodities produced in Colombia itself. Eighty factories of Venezuelan textile companies have closed down due to the massive dumping of textiles by the United States.

It is not difficult to understand how serious the consequences of this American policy are for Latin American countries, which mainly rely on foreign trade and have underdeveloped domestic national industries. Latin American countries are experiencing many economic difficulties: inflation, unprecedented increases in the cost of living, production reduction and massive unemployment, and a sharp deterioration in the living conditions of the working people. Taking Uruguay as an example, its cost of living index rose by 252.2 percent between 1953 and June 30, 1955. It is not difficult to understand the current economic situation of Latin American countries based on this background.

It must also be mentioned that American monopoly capital, through its control of Latin American countries' foreign trade, has also grossly interfered in the internal affairs of Latin American countries and obtained various privileges. This is no longer a secret. Former Brazilian President Vargas's Director of the Civil Advisory Bureau, Senator Fontes, recently revealed that Brazil depends on the whims of the American market, and price increases and decreases are entirely controlled by the American market. This artificial price fluctuation is a "political weapon for enslavement and control." This is why the United States forces most Latin American countries to sign bilateral military and trade agreements with it, so that almost all the raw materials exported by these countries are classified as either "strategic" materials or "important" materials.

In order to change this extremely unfavorable situation, the people of Latin American countries have long been struggling to expand international trade and get rid of American trade shackles. Even the governments of some countries, regardless of American pressure and obstruction, have begun to seek a way out in the prosperous markets of peaceful and democratic countries. For example, Argentina signed a huge trade agreement with the Soviet Union in 1953. Furthermore, it has successively signed agreements with Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary. In addition, Mexico with Czechoslovakia, Paraguay with Czechoslovakia, and Uruguay with the Soviet Union and Democratic Germany have also signed agreements respectively. In recent years, Brazil has signed agreements with Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Argentine business people, in order to develop trade relations with our country, sent a delegation to visit our country in 1953 and issued a joint communique. Trade between Latin America and the socialist camp countries is conducted on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. According to the trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Argentina, the Soviet Union shall supply Argentina with equipment and materials for the petroleum extraction industry, railway and electrical technical equipment, tractors, agricultural machinery and other machinery. By the way, according to Argentina's "Objective Report," the United States had "repeatedly refused" to supply Argentina with petroleum industrial equipment.

Many facts prove that the urgent economic interests of Latin American countries require the establishment and development of trade ties with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries. Politicians and public opinion in Latin American countries increasingly believe that developing trade relations with peaceful and democratic countries is an important step in changing the economic difficulties of their own countries. The Chairman of the Council of State of Uruguay, Luis Batlle Berres, in a recent speech, emphasized the need to expand trade relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. He said that we have neglected the markets of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, which is a big mistake on our part.

Now, the movement to strive for the establishment and development of trade relations with peaceful and democratic countries is expanding. In Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, the legislative assemblies and city councils of many states, members of the National Congress of various political parties, members of the legislative assemblies of various states, and representatives of the trade community support this movement. Sao Paulo, the commercial and industrial center of Brazil, held a mass meeting on August 1st, with the participation of members of parliament, business people, trade unions, and student movement leaders, demanding that Brazil establish diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries. In Uruguay, this movement has also received the support of representatives of manufacturers, merchants, agricultural organizations, and various political parties. We believe that with the unremitting efforts of the public in Latin American countries, trade relations between Latin American countries and the socialist camp countries will surely achieve positive results.

    拉丁美洲国家要求扩大国际贸易
    钦本立
    在国际局势有所缓和的情况下，拉丁美洲各国公众争取同和平民主国家扩大贸易关系的运动，正在不断高涨。
    正如巴西“工人呼声报”最近所指出的：“现在，全国大多数工商人士以及许多大土地所有者都要求恢复同苏联的关系。他们主张对社会主义阵营国家采取新的政策。他们看到在美国垄断资本控制下，国民经济的困难情况日益增长。因为美国垄断资本为了自己的利益把他们的意志强加于人，正把这个国家推向完全的破产。”这不只是巴西一个国家的经济情况如此，其他拉丁美洲国家的经济也正遭受着同样的困难。巴西“工人呼声报”的意见，代表了拉丁美洲各国共同的要求。
    美国在一九五四年对拉丁美洲国家的贸易情况表明，为了力图防止日益临近的经济危机，美国垄断资本正在把它的负担转嫁到拉丁美洲国家的人民身上。美国一方面减少由拉丁美洲国家的进口，另一方面又以美国“过剩”商品向这些国家倾销。
    譬如，美国垄断组织控制着拉丁美洲十三个咖啡生产国家的销售市场，今年二月美国故意减低进口，迫使这些国家不得不进一步削减咖啡的出口价格。据智利“我们的时代”杂志说，由于这次的价格降低，使哥伦比亚咖啡生产遭到的损失达四亿美元。这样的损失严重地破坏了这些国家的经济基础。因为咖啡是拉丁美洲各国的主要出口项目：咖啡及棉花在一九五四年上半年占巴西全部出口的百分之八十一；咖啡在哥伦比亚出口中占百分之八十以上，危地马拉占百分之七十六，萨尔瓦多占百分之八十八，尼加拉瓜占百分之五十。
    关于古巴糖的出口贸易所遭受到的困难也是一个富有典型性的例子。古巴出口的百分之七十五是砂糖。其中有一半左右是运往美国的。在一九五一年，美国由于需要糖，曾抬高了糖价。在古巴的糖业由于价格上涨而增产以后，美国近几年来却大量削减收购，把价格压到一个很低的水平。从一九五一年中到一九五四年，古巴糖的价格就下跌了百分之五十六。在美国压价的情况下，古巴卖不出的糖在一九五四年一年内增加了三点六倍，因而遭受的损失达一亿美元。
    另方面，拉丁美洲国家被迫降低进口税，使美国的“过剩”商品充满这些国家的市场。哥伦比亚政府在去年免除了三百种美国工业品的进口税，其中有不少商品是同哥伦比亚本国出产的商品相竞争的。委内瑞拉的纺织公司，由于美国大量倾销纺织品，而关闭了八十个工厂。
    不难了解，美国这种政策，对于主要依靠对外贸易、国内民族工业又不发达的拉丁美洲国家，带来了多么严重的后果。拉丁美洲国家正在经受着许多经济方面的困难：通货膨胀，生活费用空前上升，生产减缩和大批失业，以及劳动人民生活条件的急剧恶化。以乌拉圭为例，它在一九五三年至一九五五年六月三十日之间，生活费用指数上升了百分之二百五十二点二。人们不难根据这种背景来了解拉丁美洲国家目前的经济状况。
    还须提到，美国垄断资本通过对拉丁美洲国家对外贸易的控制，还对拉丁美洲国家的内政进行了粗暴的干涉，并取得各种特权。这已经不是一个秘密。前巴西总统瓦加斯的民政咨询局局长、参议员方台斯最近揭露说，巴西仰承美国市场的鼻息，价格的上涨和下跌全由美国市场来左右。这种人为的价格波动是“进行奴役和控制的政治武器”。这就是为什么美国要强使大多数拉丁美洲国家和它签订双边军事和贸易协定，从而把这些国家输出的几乎一切原料不是列为“战略”物资就是列为“重要”物资的缘故。
    为了改变这种极端不利的情况，拉丁美洲国家人民很久以来就在为争取扩大国际贸易和摆脱美国贸易束缚而进行斗争。甚至若干国家的政府也不顾美国的压力和阻挠，开始向繁荣的和平民主国家市场寻求出路。例如阿根廷便在一九五三年同苏联签订了一个巨额的贸易协定。并且，先后和捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、匈牙利签订了协定。此外，墨西哥同捷克斯洛伐克、巴拉圭同捷克斯洛伐克、乌拉圭同苏联和民主德国，也都分别签订了协定。巴西在最近几年中，同波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利签订了协定。阿根廷工商界人士为了发展同我国的贸易关系，在一九五三年派代表访问了我国，并发表了联合公报。拉丁美洲和社会主义阵营国家的贸易，都是在平等互利的原则下进行的。根据苏联和阿根廷的贸易协定，苏联应供给阿根廷石油开采工业的设备和材料，铁路和电气技术设备、拖拉机、农业机器及其他机器。顺便提一下，据阿根廷“目的报”揭露，美国曾“屡次拒绝”供给阿根廷以石油工业设备。
    许多事实证明，拉丁美洲国家迫切的经济利益，要求同苏联、中国和人民民主国家建立和发展贸易联系。拉丁美洲国家的政界人物和舆论，越来越认为同和平民主国家发展贸易关系，是改变自己国家经济困难状况的重要步骤。乌拉圭国务会议主席路易斯·巴特莱·柏莱斯在最近一次演说中，强调必须扩大同苏联以及各人民民主国家的贸易关系。他说，我们忽视了苏联和各人民民主国家的市场，这是我们很大的错误。
    现在，争取同和平民主国家建立和发展贸易关系的运动正在扩大中。在拉丁美洲最大的国家的巴西，许多州的立法议会、市议会，各政党的国民议会议员，各州立法议会的议员以及贸易界代表都支持这个运动。巴西工商业中心的圣保罗在八月一日举行了有议员、企业界人士、工会和学生运动领袖参加的群众大会，要求巴西同苏联、中国和各人民民主国家建立外交和贸易关系。在乌拉圭，这个运动也得到了制造商、商人、农业团体的代表和各个政党的代表们的支持。我们相信，在拉丁美洲各国公众坚持不懈的努力下，拉丁美洲国家同社会主义阵营国家的贸易关系，一定能取得积极的结果。
