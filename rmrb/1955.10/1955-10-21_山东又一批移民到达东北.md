Another six hundred and twenty-one peasant households, totaling two thousand six hundred and fifty-nine people, from Shandong have moved to the counties of Aihui, Xunke, Sunwu, and Foshan in Heilongjiang Province. They arrived in various parts of the Northeast by train on October 9th and 10th.

These immigrants are mostly residents of the Yellow River floodplains or flood storage areas in Liangshan, Dongping, and Juancheng counties in Shandong Province. They voluntarily signed up and their entire families agreed to go to develop the rich Northeast of the motherland. People's committees at all levels made full mobilization and preparations in advance. On the train, the state provided each person with enough food rations of large pancakes. Train attendants and escorts proposed guarantees such as "safe travel and timely supply of boiling water." After arriving at their destinations, the immigrants unanimously requested to join agricultural production cooperatives and expressed their willingness to unite with local farmers and jointly increase grain production for the country.

    山东又一批移民到达东北
    山东又有六百二十一户农民计二千六百五十九人，移往黑龙江省的瑷珲、逊克、孙吴、佛山等县。他们已经在十月九、十两日，分别乘火车到达东北各地。
    这批移民，大都是山东省梁山、东平、鄄城等县黄河套或蓄洪区的居民，他们都是为了开拓祖国富饶的东北自愿报名全家同意而去的。各级人民委员会在事前都作好了充分的动员和准备工作，在火车上，国家发给每人足够食用的大饼，列车员和护送工作人员提出了“乘车安全，及时供应开水”等保证。移民们到达目的地后，一致要求参加农业生产合作社，并表示和当地农民团结好，共同为国家增产粮食。　（本报驻济南记者）
