Important Measures to Strengthen the Planning of Railway Transportation
Cheng Chang

The Ministry of Railways will implement a unified "Rules for the Compilation and Execution of Monthly Railway Transportation Plans" nationwide from October 1st. This is a major reform in China's railway transportation planning work. The implementation of these rules will further strengthen the planning of railway transportation, help to curb unreasonable transportation, and enable China's railway transportation forces to play a greater role in realizing the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy.

In the past few years, railway transportation plans have played a certain role in meeting the needs of the national economy, saving material turnover costs, rationally using transportation vehicles, and accelerating the turnover of locomotives and vehicles. However, for a long time, there have also been serious shortcomings in the compilation and execution of railway transportation plans. The main problems are the poor accuracy of the plans and the inability to prevent unreasonable transportation through planning, resulting in a serious waste of transportation capacity.

Railway transportation plans are compiled based on the car request plans of various units. However, there have never been clear regulations on what basis these units should compile their car request plans. Annual plans were "estimated," quarterly plans were "roughly outlined," and monthly plans were only required to be "more accurate." There was no reliable basis for ensuring the accuracy of the plans. At the same time, there were no regulations on who should guarantee the completion of the transportation plan after it was compiled, or what responsibilities the carrier and the consignor should bear for the plan. As a result, plans were frequently changed, and the planning of transportation could not be steadily strengthened. In the first half of this year, railway transportation plans fell short by 230,000 cars, and extra-plan additions amounted to as much as 300,000 cars. The new "Rules for the Compilation and Execution of Monthly Railway Transportation Plans" stipulates that railway transportation plans must be compiled based on production, supply, and commodity circulation plans; both the carrier and the consignor must jointly guarantee the completion of the transportation plan, and if one party fails to complete it, they shall be liable for a fine. Strict implementation of this regulation can greatly strengthen the planning of railway transportation and eliminate the waste and confusion caused by frequent changes in transportation plans, such as having goods without cars or cars without goods.

Eliminating unreasonable phenomena such as excessive distances, counter-currents, and duplicate transportation is an important task of railway transportation planning. However, in the past, shipping units (such as the central ministries) only forwarded the original car request plans of their subordinate units, never compiled them according to destination, and therefore could not grasp the flow of goods under their jurisdiction, and could not prevent unreasonable transportation. The Ministry of Railways compiles more than 90,000 original car request plans every month, making it even more difficult to check the rationality of transportation one by one; therefore, the railway transportation plan is actually only a car loading plan, and cannot reflect the flow of goods. In a country as vast as ours, if the central ministries do not grasp the flow of goods under their jurisdiction, and the Ministry of Railways does not grasp the flow of various categories of goods nationwide, despite repeated emphasis on the necessity of rational transportation, it is impossible to eliminate unreasonable transportation, and a large amount of transportation capacity is wasted in vain. In the first quarter of this year, there were more than 90,000 cars of unreasonable transportation. The new "Rules for the Compilation and Execution of Monthly Railway Transportation Plans" requires various departments to include all transportation requirements of their subordinate enterprises in the plans of their own departments for centralized control, and the number of car request plan forms received by the Ministry of Railways every month can be reduced from more than 90,000 to hundreds; and it stipulates the format of the plan forms so that each plan form can reflect the flow of goods, which greatly facilitates the discovery and prevention of unreasonable transportation. In the first half of this year, after the Ministry of Food implemented a unified grain transportation plan, it adjusted unreasonable transportation 178 times, involving more than 600 million catties of grain, avoiding more than 4 million yuan in freight losses.

The new "Rules for the Compilation and Execution of Monthly Railway Transportation Plans" was compiled by the Ministry of Railways based on the experience of past transportation work, with the direct assistance of Soviet experts, and after trial implementation by many central economic departments. This rule is effective and feasible, and has now been approved by the State Council. The Ministry of Railways and various shipping units should work together to implement this rule, overcome various ideas that do not cherish the country's transportation capacity and fear "trouble," and gradually promote the system of unified delivery of main materials by production units and supply units, so as to give full play to the strength of existing railway transportation equipment.

    加强铁路运输计划性的重要措施
    郕昌
    铁道部从十月一日起在全国实行统一的“铁路月度运输计划的编制和执行规则”，这是我国铁路运输计划工作的一项重大改革。实行这个规则，将进一步加强铁路运输的计划性，有利于制止不合理的运输，使得我国的铁路运输力量在实现发展国民经济的第一个五年计划中，能够发挥更大的作用。
    几年来，铁路运输计划在满足国民经济的需要、节省物资的周转费用、合理使用交通运输工具和加速机车车辆的周转上，都起了一定的作用。但长期以来，在铁路运输计划的编制和执行中，也同时有严重的缺点。这主要是计划的准确程度还很差和还不能从计划中来杜绝不合理的运输，因而形成了运输力的严重浪费。
    铁路运输计划是根据各个单位的要车计划来编制的，但各个单位根据什么来编制要车计划，在过去从来没有过明确的规定。年计划是“估”的，季计划是“画个轮廓”，月计划也不过是要求“准确些”；究竟如何保证计划的准确性，并没有可靠的基础。同时运输计划编完后，谁来保证完成计划，承托双方应对计划负什么责任，也没有规定。因此，计划经常变更，运输计划性始终不能稳定地加强。今年上半年，铁路运输计划落空达二十三万车，计划外追加的更多至三十万车。新的“铁路月度运输计划的编制和执行规则”，确定必须根据生产、供应和商品流转计划来编制铁路运输计划；承托双方必须共同保证运输计划的完成，如果有一方不能完成，则应负罚款的责任。严格执行这个规定，就可以大大加强铁路运输的计划性，消除由于运输计划多变所造成的有货无车、有车无货等浪费和混乱现象。
    杜绝距离过远、对流和重复运输等不合理的现象，是铁路运输计划工作的一项重要任务。可是，过去发货单位（如中央各部）只照转所属单位的原始要车计划，从来不按去向汇编，因而不能掌握本单位所管辖的货物的流向，无法制止不合理的运输。铁道部每月汇编九万多份原始要车计划，更难一一查对运输的合理性；因而铁路运输计划实际上只是一个装车计划，也无法反映货物的流向。在我们这样一个幅员广大的国家里，中央各个部不掌握本单位所管辖的货物的流向，铁道部不掌握各种品类的货物在全国范围内的流向，尽管一再强调合理运输的必要，始终无法杜绝不合理的运输，大量运输力被白白地浪费了。今年第一季度，不合理的运输就有九万多车。新的“铁路月度运输计划的编制和执行规则”，要求各个部门把所属企业的全部运输要求一并列入本部门的计划内集中掌握，铁道部每月接到的要车计划表可由九万多份减至数百份；并规定了计划表的格式，使每一张计划表都能反映出货物的流向，这就大大便利了发现和制止不合理的运输。今年上半年，粮食部实行统一制定粮食运输计划后，就调整了不合理的运输一百七十八次，计六亿多斤粮食，避免了四百多万元运费的损失。
    新的“铁路月度运输计划的编制和执行规则”，是铁道部总结了过去运输工作的经验，在苏联专家的直接帮助下，并经过中央许多经济部门试行后才编制成功的。这个规则是有效的，可行的，现在已经国务院批准。铁道部和各个发货单位应该协同一致地来执行这个规则，克服各种不爱惜国家运输力量和怕“麻烦”的思想，并逐步推行主要物资由生产单位和供应单位统一送货的制度，充分发挥现有铁路运输设备的力量。
