    Watching a Japanese Kabuki Troupe Performance
    Mei Lanfang, Director of the Chinese Opera Research Institute

    The Japanese Kabuki troupe, led by Mr. Kunizo Matsuo and Mr. Ennosuke Ichikawa, performed three representative classical dramas on the evening of the 5th of this month in Beijing: "Kanjincho" (The Subscription List), "Keisei Hangonko" (Courtesan's Incense of Rebirth), and "Futari Dojoji" (The Two Butterflies at Dojoji Temple). After watching these three plays, I was very satisfied, and I am writing down my impressions below.

    The first play, "Kanjincho," tells the story of a power struggle during Japan's Genji era: Minamoto no Yoritomo and his younger brother Yoshitsune are in conflict, and Yoshitsune is forced to flee Kyoto with his attendants Benkei and four retainers, disguised as monks. Minamoto no Yoritomo orders all regions to capture these disguised monks. Yoshitsune, Benkei, and their four followers arrive at a checkpoint, where the guard, Togashi, questions them. Because Benkei answers fluently, Togashi is about to let them pass, but a guard notices that the baggage carrier resembles Yoshitsune. Togashi stops them again for further questioning, but he is moved by Benkei's loyalty to his master and finally allows them to pass.

    This play, "Kanjincho," is one of the Kabuki Juhachiban (Eighteen Favorite Kabuki Plays) of the Ichikawa Danjuro family. I remember seeing this play twice during my previous performances in Japan. It is also one of the most frequently performed plays in Kabuki. The creations of countless famous actors have refined everything in this play – the movements, recitations, expressions, singing, and music – to perfection. If this kind of traditional play is not performed well, it often focuses only on the traditional external acting techniques and neglects the depiction of inner emotions. However, Ichikawa Ennosuke's performance not only displayed the exquisite precision of those traditional external acting techniques but also fully embodied the character's inner emotions.

    At the beginning of the play, before the curtain rises, flute and drum sounds paint a picture of the border landscape. When Benkei appears, his dignified posture and style depict a hero of both wisdom and courage. His movements are very slow but weighty as Mount Tai, making the audience feel that he is a strong man who can lift a thousand pounds. During Togashi's questioning, the dialogue between the two was so rigorous that, although I don't understand Japanese, I almost shouted "Bravo!" at the time. Ichikawa Ennosuke's performance depicts a resourceful hero who can calmly handle everything at the most tense moments. When he recites the subscription list, Togashi makes a movement to try to peek, and Benkei flips the scroll into his arms, glaring at him. Togashi is intimidated by this imposing manner, while Benkei is also sweating, secretly rejoicing that the fake subscription list has not been exposed. This conflicting emotion of mutual fear is vividly portrayed. Benkei's small actions, such as unfolding and rolling up the scroll, and even twirling the rosary on his wrist, are all connected to other major movements, recitations, and expressions. These small actions are extracted from real life and artistically processed, completely in sync with the inner rhythm of the entire play.

    When Togashi points out that the porter is Yoshitsune, the entire play reaches its most tense climax. Benkei raises his stick and pretends to beat Yoshitsune, which involves another complex set of expressions and gestures: Ichikawa Ennosuke can perform the part where Benkei has already struck Yoshitsune several times, but the matter is still not resolved, and he cannot really continue to beat him, showing his dilemma. When Togashi suddenly lets them pass, he can show a half-believing, surprised, and delighted inner state. When Togashi offers him a farewell drink, he uses a round cage lid as a wine bowl, and then complains that the guards pour too little wine for him. He holds two wine gourds in one hand and pours the wine himself. After pouring the wine, he puts his hands on the ground, and the two gourds roll on the ground in two semi-circles simultaneously, rolling into the hands of the guards. These small actions are all dramatic and help to express the character of this heroic figure. After drinking, he performs a dance. When he opens the fan with his right hand, his left hand twirls the rosary. When the fan is folded and transferred to the left hand, the five fingers of the right hand are opened to "pull the mountain sleeve." The rosary that was twirled in the left hand naturally wraps around his wrist. He walks in a "circle field" and uses the "high posture" and "low posture" on both sides. This is similar to the drunk fist movements of Lu Zhishen in the "Mountain Gate" scene of our Kunqu Opera. His steadiness and majesty are also very similar to those of our past famous painted-face actors Mr. He Guishan and Mr. Qian Jinfu. This dance is called the "Longevity Dance," and it involves very few steps, but there are no wasted steps. There are not many movements, but they are experienced and accurate. As Benkei is about to leave the stage, he makes a "pose" to show a relieved joy, but joy turns to sorrow, and he thinks of the many dangers and difficulties they have gone through, and that they have actually escaped the net. He cannot help but shed a few tears of a hero, which is the same technique used by Qin Qiong in "Three Blocks" of Kunqu Opera when he exits Tongguan, laughing first and then crying. This can more profoundly depict the character of the hero. Benkei quickly controls his sorrow and rekindles his optimistic enthusiasm, hurrying to catch up with his master Yoshitsune. He raises his feet, making a running motion. The actual pace is quite slow, but the effect is that the audience feels that he is impatient. This realistic exaggeration is also widely used in Chinese classical drama. For example, Liu Mengmei chasing Du Liniang in "The Dream Interrupted" of Kunqu Opera, and Xu Xian's escape in "The Broken Bridge," all use this technique. Benkei's eyes move on stage in a very economical and energetic way. When there is no object to look at, he often stares downwards. When he uses his eyes, he leads the body, follows the music, and precisely focuses his gaze on the target. This use of eye expression is also the highest requirement of our Peking Opera performing arts.

    The structure of "Kanjincho" is also similar to our Chinese Gaoqiang Opera, Kunqu Opera, and Peking Opera. Togashi enters and introduces himself, and four subordinates stand at the door. Then they lead and walk, slantingly in a line to the minor side. Yoshitsune and Benkei enter and stand slantingly in a line to the major side. This is all the same as Peking Opera. Benkei and Togashi look at each other. Benkei holds his Zen staff with both hands, and Togashi holds his sword in one hand. The two alternate positions with the gongs and drums, just like the movements of Huang Chao entering the temple in "Xiangmei Temple" of Peking Opera. The way Benkei holds the Zen staff is exactly the same as our "stick holding." When he raises the stick with his right hand to "lift the sleeve" and crosses it to his left hand to "pull the mountain sleeve," I think every Peking Opera actor would give a "knowing smile." There are many other similarities in recitations and gestures with Gaoqiang Opera and Kunqu Opera, which I will not list here.

    Benkei and his party leave the stage via the hanamichi (flower path), which indeed gives the audience a strong impression. This method is unique to Japan and China. I have previously seen the "Jumping Spirit Official" in Peking Opera, where all the spirit officials on stage would jump down from the stage, circle around, and exit the theater back to the backstage. There was also a general under Niu Miao in the "Flying Fork Array," who was dressed as a foreigner. In the past, this method was occasionally used, walking from the aisle in the audience to the stage. There are also Tibetan and Mongolian Buddhist lamas who, when performing the "Zhabu" dance, always run into the audience after the dance. This method has not been developed as a focus in Chinese drama, but it is widely used in Japanese Kabuki and has achieved good results.

    The second play, "Keisei Hangonko," is about a painter who cannot be named by his teacher because of his stutter. He wants to paint a portrait of himself on a stone in the courtyard as a memorial, and then commit suicide. However, because of this painting, his teacher discovers that he is a talented painter who can inherit his legacy.

    Ichikawa Ennosuke played a role similar to Lu Zhishen just moments earlier and then played a scholar. I cannot but admire his acting genius. This play is different from "Kanjincho." I feel that the recitation in "Kanjincho" is "rhythmic recitation," like what we call "Shangkou" in Peking Opera, while this play is equivalent to "Jingbai" (Beijing dialect recitation). Many of the movements also lack a dance-like quality. The image of the protagonist Ukiyo Matahei in this play is equivalent to Lu Kunjie in "Descend the Mountain in Happiness" of Peking Opera. Ichikawa Ennosuke's portrayal of this character's crying due to his stutter and self-hatred, and his subsequent ecstasy, are all very profound and moving. His style and performance are similar to those of our past famous actor Mr. Cheng Jixian. When his wife pulls him to prevent him from committing suicide, the gestures of falling to the ground both inside and outside, as well as the "one fall" and "two falls" with his senior brother Shuri-no-suke, are similar to Mr. Cheng Jixian's performance.

    The third play, "Futari Dojoji," is a dance drama that preserves many Japanese folk dances and folk songs.

    Many Japanese dances use fans. Poems and lyrics from China's Tang and Song dynasties often have phrases like "singing gowns and dancing fans," indicating that "dancing with fans" has been around for a long time. Today, after watching Benkei's dance with a fan and the dances with fans by the Dojoji dancers Hanako and Sakurako, I feel that many of the styles, gestures, and movements of the fans in Chinese and Japanese dramas are the same, but there are also some styles that are not currently in our Peking Opera. The most obvious is the opening of the fan to another hand, using the fingers to pick up the fan face to make various movements without holding the fan bone. I think this style is very beautiful.

    Among the several dances in this play, the hat dance, the towel dance, and the tambourine dance are the most beautiful. The final transformation into a snake using a large red cloth to block it is also a commonly used method in our Peking Opera in the past. The snake's facial makeup simply outlines two fangs and eye sockets and eyebrows on the original white face. It also wears a "unkempt wig," red trousers, and a gold-threaded tortoise-shell brocade outer garment. This simply and characteristically completes the snake's makeup. Finally, a group of snake hunters is used to connect together, with the last person "picking up and topping" the person in front, symbolizing the raised snake's tail. The snake spirit himself stands on a stool, symbolizing the raised snake's head. A snake catcher holding a green bamboo pole rides on the snake's body. This creates a snake shape, which is the most economical way to handle it on stage, similar to the way Kunqu Opera "Returning to Camp and Hunting" uses four moon banners, eight standard flags, and a large flag to create a boat. The entire play closes after the snake shape is formed, giving the audience a strong impression.

    Japanese Kabuki is a traditional Japanese theatrical art with unique colors and beautiful styles. It is based on realism, but also has some exaggerated elements in its performance. This is similar to our classical Chinese drama. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to find many things worth learning from it.

    看日本歌舞伎剧团的演出
    中国戏曲研究院院长  梅兰芳
    以松尾国三、市川猿之助两位先生为首的日本歌舞伎剧团，于本月五日晚在北京演出了“劝进帐”（化缘簿）、“倾城返魂香”和“双蝶道成寺”三出有代表性的古典戏剧。我看了这三出戏以后，感到非常的满意，现在把我的印象写在下面。
    第一出“劝进帐”的内容是日本源氏时代的一个争权的故事：源赖朝和他的弟弟义经相争，义经被迫率领他的亲随弁庆和四个家臣化装为和尚逃出了京都，源赖朝通令各地，捉拿这几个伪装的和尚。义经和弁庆等主仆六人来到一个关卡，守关的官吏富樫盘查他们，因为弁庆对答如流，富樫正预备放他们过关，忽然有一个守卒发现挑行李的像是义经，富樫又阻住他们，继续盘查，但被弁庆苦心救主的忠忱所感动，终于放他们过关。
    这出“劝进帐”是市川团十郎家的拿手好戏歌舞伎十八番之一。我记得从前两次去日本演出的时候，都看过这出戏。它也是歌舞伎中上演次数最多的剧目之一。无数名演员的创造，使得这出戏一切的动作、念白、表情、歌唱、音乐，都达到了精炼的化境。像这类传统剧目，倘若演不好，往往会失之于只重视传统的外部的演技，而忽略了内心活动的刻划。而市川猿之助的表演，既显示了那些传统的精确的外部演技的精湛，也充分地体现了角色的内在情感。
    这出戏开始时，帘幕未启，先有笛声和鼓声渲染出边关的景象。当弁庆出场的时候，他那严整的工架台风就刻画出一个智勇兼备的英雄形象，举动非常慢而分量却重如泰山，使观众感觉到他是一个力举千钧的好汉。在富樫盘查的时候，两个人对白是那样严谨，我虽然不懂日本语言，但当时我却听得几乎叫出“好”来。市川猿之助的表演，刻划出一个机智的英雄在最紧张的关头能镇静地应付一切的气概。当他朗诵缘簿时，富樫有一个想要偷看的身段，弁庆把卷子往怀里一翻，怒目而视，富樫为他这种气概所吓住，而弁庆同时也捏着一把汗，心里庆幸着假缘簿没有被识破，这种双方害怕的矛盾心情，表现得生动异常。弁庆的小动作，例如双手拉开卷子和卷起卷子，以至绕一绕手腕上数珠等等，都是同其他大的动作以及念白、表情等一线相连的。这些小动作都是从现实生活中提炼出来并经过艺术加工的，同整个戏的内在节奏完全合拍。
    当富樫指出挑夫是义经时，全剧达到了最紧张的高潮。弁庆举棍假装要打义经，又是一段复杂的表情和身段：市川猿之助能演出弁庆已经打了义经几棍，而事情仍不得解决，但又不能真的继续打下去，以致左右为难的神气，等到富樫突然放他们过关，他又能表现出半信半疑，又惊又喜的内心活动。富樫给他饯行的时候，他喝酒用一个圆笼盖当酒碗，又嫌守卒给他斟的酒太少，他一手一个拿着两个酒葫芦自己斟酒，斟完酒接着双手往地下一放，两个葫芦倒在地下同时滚两个半圆形，滚到守卒的手中。这些小动作，都是富有戏剧性的动作，有助于表现这个豪放人物的性格的。喝完酒跳了一回舞，当他右手打开扇子的时候，左手捻着数珠，当扇子并起来转到左手的时候，右手五指张开“拉山膀”，原来左手捻的数珠很自然地绕在腕子上，走着“圆场”，使着两边的“高像”、“矮像”，这和我们昆曲的“山门”里鲁智深醉后使拳的身段是一个类型。他的稳重威严也和我们过去的名花脸演员何桂山先生钱金福先生很近似。这一个舞名叫“延年舞”，走的步很少，但没有一个废步，动作不多，但是老练准确。弁庆在将要下场时，回身使一个“像”，表现出如释重负的愉快，但喜极生悲，想到经过许多危险和艰难，居然逃出罗网，不觉掉下一点英雄泪来，这和我们昆曲“三挡”里面的秦琼，出潼关时先笑后哭，用的是同样的手法。这样就更能够深刻地描绘出英雄性格。弁庆把悲哀的心情很快地控制住，重新鼓舞起乐观的热情，急忙追赶他的主人义经，他抬高了脚步，作着跑的身段，实际尺寸相当慢，但收到的效果却是使观众感觉到他有一种迫不及待的神情。这种现实主义的夸张手法，在中国古典戏剧中也广泛地使用着。如昆曲“惊梦”柳梦梅追赶杜丽娘，“断桥”许仙的逃跑等等都是用这个手法。弁庆的眼睛在台上移动的线路非常经济而有神，在没有注视的对象时，经常是凝目下垂，等到运用眼睛的时候，领着身段，随着音乐，很精确地把视线焦点放到目的上去。这种眼神的用法也是我们京剧表演艺术的最高的要求。
    “劝进帐”的结构组织，也是和我们中国的高腔昆腔皮黄相近的，富樫上场自己通名叙事，有四个手下站门，然后领起来走，归小边斜一字，义经弁庆上场站大边斜一字，这都和京剧一样。弁庆和富樫互相注视，弁庆双手持禅杖，富樫一手按剑，两人随着锣鼓互相换位，和京剧“祥梅寺”黄巢进庙时的身段一样。弁庆手里禅杖的拿法，和我们的“棍把”是分毫不差的。当他右手拿棍“上膀子”交左手“拉山膀”的时候，我想每个京剧演员看了都会发出“会心的微笑”。其余念白，身段，和高腔昆腔近似的地方很多，这里不一一列举了。
    弁庆一行人由花道下场，的确是给观众一个强烈的印象，这种方法是日本和中国所特有的。我从前曾见过京剧里面的“跳灵官”，所有台上灵官跳完都由台上走下来，绕一圈由剧场出去绕回后台。还有“飞叉阵”牛邈手下的一员将官是一个外国人的扮相，从前演的时候，偶尔也采用这个方法，由观众席中的过道走上台去。还有藏族、蒙古族的佛教徒喇嘛，表演跳“扎布”的时候，跳完后也总是跑到观众中去。这种方法在中国戏剧中没有当作重点发展，而在日本的歌舞伎中则广泛地使用着，并且收到了很好的效果。
    第二出“倾城返魂香”的故事是一个画家因口吃不能得到老师的命名，想在院中石头上画自己一幅肖像留作纪念，而后自杀，但由于这幅画，老师发现他是个天才的画家，可以承继他的衣钵。
    市川猿之助在刚刚扮演一个类似鲁智深的角色之后，又扮演一个书生，我真不能不钦佩他的表演天才。这出戏和“劝进帐”不同，我感觉到“劝进帐”的念白是“韵白”，像我们京剧所谓“上口”，而这出戏则相当于“京白”，动作也有很多时不带舞蹈性。这出戏的主角浮世又平的形象相当于京剧“得意缘下山”的卢昆杰，市川猿之助扮这个角色因口吃而自恨的哭，和后来的狂喜，都非常深刻动人。他的风格和表演和我们过去名演员程继先先生的手法差不多，当他妻子拉着他阻止他自杀的时候，里外两个跌坐在地下的身段以及和他师兄修理之介“一扑”“两扑”的身段，都和程继先先生的表演有异曲同工之妙。
    第三出“双蝶道成寺”，是个舞剧，其中保存了许多日本的民间舞蹈和民间歌曲。
    日本的很多舞蹈都使用扇子，我国唐宋时代的诗词，也常常有“歌衫舞扇”的句子，可见得“舞扇”是由来已久了。由于今天我看弁庆的舞扇和道成寺舞姬花子，舞姬樱子的舞扇，我觉得中日两国戏剧中舞扇的式样、手势、身段很多是相同的，但也有些式样是我们现在京剧中所没有的，最明显的莫过于打开的扇子交到另一个手，用手指拈着扇面作各种身段而不拿扇骨，我觉得这一式样是很美丽的。
    这出戏中的几种舞，以花笠舞，手巾舞，铃鼓舞三种最为好看。最后变蛇用一块大红布挡住，也是我们京剧从前常用的方法。蛇的脸谱，只是在原来的粉脸上勾出两个獠牙和眼窝眉子；又戴上“蓬头”穿红裤子，披一件金线龟背锦的袱子，这就简单而又富有特点地完成了蛇的扮相。最后利用一群打蛇的人接连起来，末尾一个人由前面那一个人“抄起一把顶”，象征着翘起的蛇尾，蛇精本人站在凳子上象征着昂起的蛇头，由一个捕蛇人拿着绿竹竿，骑在蛇身上，这样摆成一条蛇形，这是舞台上最经济的处理方法，和昆曲“回营打围”利用四个月华旗八个标旗一个大纛摆成一条船，是一样的手法。全剧在蛇形摆成后闭幕，给观众一个强烈的印象。
    日本歌舞伎是富有独特色彩和优美风格的日本民族的传统戏剧艺术。它以现实主义为基础，同时，在表演上又有某些夸张的成分。这跟我国的古典戏剧相似。因此我们是不难从中发现许多值得学习的东西的。
