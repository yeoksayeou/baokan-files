Another Major Achievement in Tibet's Construction
Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the Communist Party of China

The Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways, running through central Tibet with a total length of 428 kilometers, are now fully open to traffic. This is another major achievement in Tibet's construction following the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways to Lhasa.

The construction of these two highways, along with the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, is a concrete manifestation of our country's First Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy in Tibet. Therefore, the completion of the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways once again demonstrates the care and love of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups in the motherland, Chairman Mao, for the Tibetan people. It shows that the state fully considers the needs of the Tibetan people in its economic and cultural construction. It also specifically illustrates that while focusing on key construction projects, our country also allocates considerable manpower and material resources to help ethnic minorities develop their economies and cultures, in order to gradually eliminate the de facto inequalities between ethnic groups that have been left over by history.

The opening of the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways has brought significant changes to Tibet's transportation situation. From now on, the connection between Tibet and the interior of the motherland will be closer, and the main part of transportation between different regions of Tibet will be replaced by automobiles instead of primitive transportation tools. These two highways connect the three major cities of Tibet, linking the vast northern Tibetan grasslands, the fertile middle reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, and the agricultural area of the Nyang Chu River basin. In the past, it took more than ten days of arduous travel for people to travel between Lhasa and Rikaze and Gyantse. Transporting surplus grain from the agricultural areas in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and the Nyang Chu River basin to Lhasa, transporting animal products and local products from pastoral areas, and trade and transportation between the three cities consumed a huge amount of manpower and animal power every year. After the highways are opened, the journey between Lhasa and Rikaze and Gyantse will only take two days. What used to take sixty livestock more than ten days to transport can now be transported by a single car in two days. These two highways will play a significant role in further strengthening internal unity in Tibet, invigorating Tibet's economy and culture, continuing to strengthen the ties between Tibet and the interior of the motherland, and strengthening the unity between the Tibetan and other fraternal ethnic groups. In particular, this major improvement in Tibet's transportation has greatly shortened the distance between Tibet's major cities—Lhasa, Rikaze, and Gyantse—facilitating mutual visits between representatives from various places, exchanging opinions, and consulting on matters, thereby greatly benefiting the early establishment of the preparatory committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, as well as uniting all parties, uniformly planning various construction undertakings in Tibet, and gradually realizing regional autonomy in Tibet. At the same time, the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways provide favorable conditions for supporting the already started construction of the Gyantse-Pari highway and for the development of the rich resources in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and the Nyang Chu River basin.

The Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways were stipulated to be built in the State Council's decision on transportation issues in Tibet this March. Surveying and design began in the spring, construction started at the end of May, and it was completed ahead of schedule in just a few months. This shows the Central People's Government's concern for the Tibetan people, turning resolutions into practical actions immediately. The newly built section of the Lhasa-Rikaze highway from Yangbajing to the west is 247 kilometers long. The route crosses two large mountains of the Gangdise Mountains in the southern part of the northern Tibetan grasslands, crosses the Yarlung Tsangpo River, the largest river in Tibet, and has an average altitude of about 4,000 meters. When the road construction workers and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army were working on the Xugela (Mountain) at an altitude of more than 5,300 meters, they overcame difficulties such as wind, snow, hail, and thin air with a high degree of enthusiasm and strong will to build the border of the motherland and help the Tibetan people build a better life, and opened up roads from the permanently frozen layer on the top of the mountain.

The Rikaze-Gyantse highway was built by the State Council as a work-for-relief project to help the people along the Nyang Chu River who suffered from floods last year. More than 3,000 male and female Tibetan laborers participating in the road construction, inspired by the warm concern of the central government and the people of the whole country for them and the enthusiasm for building a happy homeland, carried out labor competitions in the muddy rainy season, and with the kind help of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, quickly learned road construction techniques, built this 91-kilometer highway in 102 days, and relied on it to survive the disaster, basically restored production, and rebuilt their homes.

During the road construction process, the Tibetan local government and the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee mobilized the people along the route to vigorously support it, and sent officials to participate in the Rikaze-Gyantse Highway Construction Headquarters, allocated a large amount of grain, and prepared timber for bridge construction. The vast numbers of farmers and herdsmen along the two highways dispatched tens of thousands of livestock to transport road construction materials and supply fuel to road construction personnel. Residents on the northern slopes of the Himalayas transported rice distributed to migrant workers from Pari to Gyantse by manpower, and boatmen on the Yarlung Tsangpo River transported highland barley from the upstream areas to Rikaze to supply migrant workers. In the construction of these two highways, the Tibetan people once again demonstrated their enthusiasm and great strength in creating a happy life, showing their enthusiasm for realizing the country's First Five-Year Plan, and their unified will to build the motherland together with fraternal ethnic groups.

Since the State Council passed the decision on various tasks in Tibet this March, and since the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni returned to Tibet from the capital of the motherland, a new stage in the development of Tibet's work has begun. The preparatory work for the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has begun; hundreds of vehicles allocated by the central government to the Kangzang and Qingzang Highway Administration are continuously transporting industrial products and construction equipment from the interior of the motherland to Tibet; the survey work for various construction projects in the State Council's decision is about to be completed. Hundreds of Tibetan officials, young men and women have gone to the interior of the motherland to visit and study, and hundreds of professional cadres sent by the central government have already taken up their posts and are on their way to Tibet. Now the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways have been successfully built. However, on the way to building a happy and prosperous Tibet, there are still many arduous tasks and new difficulties. We must not be complacent in the slightest because of the beginning of this new development. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, better implement the Party's ethnic policy, be modest and prudent, work diligently, proceed from reality in all work, respect the wishes of the Tibetan people, and serve the Tibetan people loyally and for a long time. We know that imperialism and its running dogs will not be reconciled to the victory of the motherland and the Tibetan people. People of all strata in Tibet and all personnel entering Tibet must maintain a high degree of vigilance, continue to strengthen ethnic unity and internal unity in Tibet, and resolutely implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the decisions of the State Council. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, we will work a hundred times harder to jointly build the motherland and create a happy life on the plateau.

    西藏建设中的又一重大成就
    中国共产党西藏工作委员会副书记　范明
    纵贯西藏中部，总长四百二十八公里的拉（萨）日（喀则）、日（喀则）江（孜）公路全线通车了。这是继康藏、青藏两公路通车拉萨后，西藏建设中的又一重大成就。
    这两条公路，和康藏、青藏公路的筑成，是我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划在西藏的具体表现。因此，拉日、日江公路的建成，再次表明了中国共产党和祖国各民族伟大领袖毛主席对藏族人民的关怀和爱护，说明了国家在经济、文化建设中充分注意了藏族人民的需要。同时也具体说明了我国在重点建设的同时，还拿出相当的人力、物力，帮助少数民族发展经济、文化事业，以求逐步消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等。
    拉日、日江公路的通车，给西藏交通情况带来了重大变化。从此，西藏地方和祖国内地的联系更加密切了，西藏各地区间联系和运输的主要部分也由汽车代替了原始交通工具。这两条公路连接了西藏三个主要城市，沟通了辽阔的藏北草原、富饶的雅鲁藏布江中游和年楚河流域农业区。过去，拉萨和日喀则、江孜人民之间的来往要经过十多天的艰难路程；从雅鲁藏布江中游和年楚河流域农业区调运余粮到拉萨，牧区畜产品、土产品的运出，三个城市间的贸易运输，每年都要费去浩繁的人力、畜力。公路通车后，拉萨和日喀则、江孜间的路程只要两天时间，过去用六十头牲口跋涉十多天运输的货物，现在用一辆汽车两天内就运到了。这两条公路对进一步加强西藏内部团结，活跃西藏的经济和文化，继续密切西藏和祖国内地的联系，加强藏族和各兄弟民族的团结，都将起相当作用。特别是由于西藏交通的这一重大改善，使西藏几个主要城市——拉萨、日喀则和江孜间的里程大大缩短了，便利了各地代表人物互相来往，交换意见，协商办事，从而对早日成立西藏自治区筹备委员会，以及团结各方面，统一筹办西藏各项建设事业，逐步实现西藏区域自治，都有很大好处。同时，拉日、日江公路对支援已经开始修筑的江（孜）帕（里）公路，对雅鲁藏布江中游和年楚河流域丰富资源的开发，也提供了有利条件。
    拉日、日江公路是今年三月国务院关于有关西藏交通运输问题的决定中规定修筑的。从春季开始测量设计，五月底动工，短短几个月就提前修成了。这说明了中央人民政府对西藏人民的关怀，把决议立即变成实际行动。拉日公路从羊八井向西新建工程二百四十七公里，路线翻越藏北草原南部冈底斯山脉的两座大山，跨过西藏第一大河雅鲁藏布江，平均拔海高度在四千公尺左右。筑路职工和人民解放军的指挥员和战斗员在拔海五千三百多公尺的旭格拉（山）上施工时，以建设祖国边疆和帮助藏族人民建设美好生活的高度热忱和顽强意志，战胜了风雪冰雹和空气稀薄等困难，从山顶永久冻层中开出了道路。
    日江公路是国务院为救济去年遭受水灾的年楚河沿岸人民以工代赈修筑的。参加筑路的三千多名男女藏族民工，在感激中央和全国人民对他们的热切关怀和建设幸福家园的热情鼓舞下，在雨季泥泞中开展了劳动竞赛，并在人民解放军战士的亲切帮助下，很快学会了筑路技术，一百零二天修成了这条九十一公里的公路，并且赖此渡过了灾荒，基本上恢复了生产，重建了家园。
    在修路过程中，西藏地方政府和班禅堪布会议厅委员会动员沿线人民大力支援，并派出官员参加日江公路修路指挥部，拨借大批粮食，准备修桥木料。两条公路沿线的广大农民和牧民，出动了上万头牲畜运送筑路物资，供应筑路人员燃料。喜马拉雅山北麓居民用人力把发给民工的大米从帕里运到江孜，雅鲁藏布江上的牛皮船水手把上游地区的青稞运到日喀则，供应民工。藏族人民在修筑这两条公路中，再次显示了他们创造幸福生活的热情和巨大力量，表明了他们对实现国家第一个五年计划的积极性，和与兄弟民族共同建设祖国的统一意志。
    从今年三月国务院通过关于西藏各项工作的决定，以及达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼从祖国首都返回西藏以来，西藏工作发展的新阶段已经开始了。西藏自治区筹备委员会的筹备工作已经展开；中央拨给康藏、青藏两条公路管理局的数百辆汽车正源源地把祖国内地的工业品和建设器材运来西藏；国务院决定中的各项建设的勘测工作即将完成。数百名藏族官员、男女青年赴祖国内地参观学习，中央派来的数百名专业干部已经踏上工作岗位和正在来藏途中。现在拉日、日江公路又胜利建成了。但是，在建设幸福繁荣的西藏的途中，还有着许多艰巨任务和新的困难，我们决不能因这一新发展的开端而有丝毫自满，一定要遵循着毛主席的指示，更好地执行党的民族政策，戒骄戒躁，兢兢业业，一切工作从实际出发，尊重藏族人民意愿，忠诚地、长期地为藏族人民服务。我们知道，帝国主义及其走狗是不会甘心祖国和西藏人民的胜利的。西藏各阶层人民和全体进藏人员一定要保持高度警惕，继续加强民族团结和西藏内部的团结，坚决贯彻和平解放西藏办法的协议和国务院的决定。在党中央、毛主席、中央人民政府领导下，为共同建设祖国，为在高原上创造幸福生活而百倍努力。
