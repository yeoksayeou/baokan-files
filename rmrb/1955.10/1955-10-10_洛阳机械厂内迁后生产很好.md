Production is good at the Luoyang Machinery Factory after relocation inland

    Since the Luoyang Machinery Factory, relocated from the coast inland, began production, it has continuously completed its production tasks in July and August.

    This factory was originally a machinery factory in Shanghai, capable of manufacturing 6-ton to 8-ton road rollers, electric concrete vibrators, cement spray guns, and other important machinery needed in construction projects. These products were sold throughout the country and some were exported.

    This factory moved to Luoyang in November of last year and was fully put into production at the end of May this year. Now, this factory is located in the central area of our country and can better play its role in supporting national economic construction. According to recent statistics, basic construction units in more than ten provinces and cities, including Xi'an, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Wuhan, Luoyang, Xinjiang, and Yunnan, have placed orders with the factory.

    洛阳机械厂内迁后生产很好
    由沿海内迁的洛阳机械厂开工生产以后，七、八两月连续完成了生产任务。
    这个厂原是上海市的一个机械厂，能制造六吨到八吨压力的压路机和电动混凝土震动器、水泥喷枪等建筑工程中需用的重要机械。这些产品曾运销全国各地，并有部分出口。
    这个厂在去年十一月迁到洛阳，今年五月底全面投入生产。现在，这个厂已是处在我国中心地带，能够更好地发挥支援国家经济建设的作用。据最近统计，已有西安、兰州、重庆、武汉、洛阳、新疆、云南等十多个省市的基本建设单位向这个厂订货。　　　　（本报驻郑州记者）
