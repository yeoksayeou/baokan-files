Xinhua News Agency Report: The Tibetan Engineering Survey Team has basically completed the surveying and partial preliminary design work for the first three major construction projects under the "State Council's Decision on Assisting the Tibetan Local Government in Construction Matters." The survey team has completed a preliminary design for expanding the original Lhasa Hydropower Station, and the surveying and geological drilling work for another, better-equipped new Lhasa Hydropower Station will be completed before the end of this month. The planned installed capacity of these two power stations will be twenty times greater than that of the original Lhasa Hydropower Station. The technical design for the Shigatse Small Thermal Power Station has also been completed, and engineering personnel are currently preparing the project budget and purchase orders. Water conservancy personnel have recently completed most of the preliminary survey work for building dikes and dams on the Lhasa River and the Nyang Chu River, and the preliminary design for the Lhasa flood control project can begin in November. Local industrial engineering personnel have collected all the preliminary design data for the Lhasa Small Iron Factory and Leather Factory. It is expected that the preliminary design and some technical and construction organization designs for these projects will be completed in the fourth quarter of this year. The expansion project of the original Lhasa Hydropower Station, the construction project of the Shigatse Small Thermal Power Station, and the construction of some dikes and dams on the Lhasa River and the Nyang Chu River, etc., can commence in the spring of next year.

While carrying out the above work, the survey team assisted the Tibetan local government in building temporary flood control projects in Lhasa during this year's rainy season; and surveyed wasteland and irrigation canals for the planned Lhasa and Shigatse mechanized farms, and collected some preliminary data for the planned Shigatse Hydropower Station. The survey team also surveyed a large hydropower resource upstream of the Yangbajing River, not far from Lhasa, and inspected an iron ore mine in the northern suburbs of Lhasa, which contains more than 70% iron. The survey team also plans to send people to survey hydropower resources along the Yarlung Tsangpo River and Yamdrok Lake in the winter of this year and the spring of next year.

    西藏工程勘察队完成三项建设的勘测工作
    据新华社讯　西藏工程勘察队已基本完成“国务院关于帮助西藏地方进行建设事项的决定”的前三项主要建设的勘测和部分初步设计工作。勘察队已作出了扩建原拉萨水力发电站的初步设计，另一座设备较完善的新建拉萨水力发电站的测量、地质钻探工作将在本月底以前完成。这两个电站的预计装机容量将比原拉萨水力发电站的装机容量大二十倍。日喀则小型火力发电站的技术设计也已作好，工程人员正在编制工程预算和订货单。水利人员最近已完成了修建拉萨河和年楚河河堤、水坝的大部草测工作，拉萨市防洪工程的初步设计十一月即可开始。地方工业工程人员已搜集齐了拉萨小型铁工厂和皮革厂的初步设计资料。预计这些工程的初步设计和部分技术和施工组织的设计将在今年第四季度完成。原拉萨水力发电站的扩建工程、日喀则小型火力发电站修建工程，和拉萨河、年楚河部分河堤、水坝的修筑工程等，明年春季即可动工。
    勘察队在进行上述工作的同时，帮助西藏地方政府修筑了今年雨季拉萨临时性防洪工程；并为筹建拉萨和日喀则两个机耕农场勘测了荒地和灌溉渠道，为筹建日喀则水力发电站搜集了部分初步资料。勘察队还勘测了羊八井河上游距拉萨不远的一处很大的水力资源，察看了拉萨市北郊的一处铁矿，这个铁矿含铁量达百分之七十以上。勘察队还准备在今年冬天明年春天，派人沿雅鲁藏布江和羊卓雍湖进行水力资源的勘察。
