Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: The Indian Republic Film Week, held in twenty cities across the country, concluded successfully on the 23rd. According to incomplete statistics from over 120 cinemas in fourteen cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Shenyang, and Xi'an, a total audience of over two million people attended the 3,192 screenings of films from the 17th to the 21st and 22nd. If we add the audience figures for the last day or two in these fourteen cities, the seven-day audience figures for the six cities of Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Chongqing, and the audience figures for all the cinemas and film projection teams that screened the same four Indian films without formally participating in Film Week, the total will reach more than three million people.

    Tickets for many city cinemas were sold out in advance of the Film Week. Kunming audiences reserved tickets from various cinemas ten days before the start of the Film Week. In Shenyang, over 260,000 people from all walks of life registered for reserved screenings. This number of reserved screenings alone exceeded the total audience figures counted in Shenyang up to the 22nd by more than 30,000 people. In Jinan, one workers' theater alone pre-sold over 8,000 tickets. The Da Guan Cinema in Jinan, with only 1,100 seats, sold over 2,300 tickets for two screenings of "Awara" on the evening of the 20th. In Harbin, each cinema sold an additional fifty to one hundred standing tickets every night. In Dalian, at the request of the audience, all cinemas increased screenings from the original four per day to eight or nine, but still could not meet the needs of the audience. One day, the Sino-Soviet Cinema had already screened nine consecutive shows, but the two to three thousand spectators crowded in front of the door still demanded that the tenth and eleventh shows be continued. Many viewers watched the Indian films once, twice, or even three times. At a workers' theater in Jinan, where "Awara" Parts 1 and 2 were screened, more than 90% of the audience watched both parts consecutively. Many audiences in various cities, unable to purchase tickets, have requested that the cinemas continue to screen the films. Due to the enthusiastic demands of the general audience, "Two Acres of Land" will be re-screened for another week in Chengdu from the 24th. Many other cities will also continue to screen the Indian films at the request of the audience.

    Newspapers and periodicals in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Jinan, Kunming, and other places have published articles on the Indian film industry and reviews, introductions, and impressions of the four films screened in China this time. The authors of these articles include Chinese film directors, actors, and writers who have visited India, film critics, playwrights, artists, university professors, and people from all walks of life. Murong Wan'er, the translator of the film "Two Acres of Land," wrote in Shanghai: "I was often attracted by the moving scenes in the film when translating it." Li Qiao, a Yi ethnic writer from Kunming, published an article entitled "A Touching Film - 'Two Acres of Land'," strongly recommending this excellent film. A film playwright in Xi'an also gave high praise to the music full of national characteristics in this film. After watching "The Storm" workers from Chengdu Paper Mill expressed that they “felt more close to India”. In Nanning, audiences of Han, Zhuang, Miao, Yao, and Dong nationalities all loved "The Storm." A spectator from the Hui Muslim Hospital in Beijing wrote in the cinema's audience comment book: "The film 'Awara' expresses a strong Oriental lyricism and is full of the content of the people, which is really unforgettable." Staff from the Sichuan Provincial Museum of Literature and History in Chengdu believed that watching "Indian Art and Construction" was of great help to their work. Cinemas in Dalian also received many letters from the audience welcoming and praising Indian films.

    Before and after the start of Film Week, enthusiastic publicity work was carried out in various places. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and other units held film lectures to introduce the themes and artistic achievements of Indian films to the general public. Twenty days before the start of Film Week, the Shandong Office of the China Film Distribution Company decorated an art gallery on Jing'er Road, the busiest street in Jinan, and displayed pictures of Indian films in the windows of twenty large stores in batches. Each cinema also exhibited stills from the films. In many units in Harbin, Dalian, and other places, film symposiums were held, where people who had watched Indian films discussed their impressions.

    印度共和国电影周胜利结束
    据新华社二十三日讯　在全国二十个城市举行的印度共和国电影周已在二十三日结束。据北京、上海、天津、武汉、沈阳、西安等十四个城市一百二十多家电影院自十七日到二十一日和二十二日所放映的三千一百九十二场电影中的不完全统计，观众共达二百多万人次。如果加上这十四个城市最后一两天的观众数字和广州、南京、重庆等六个城市的七天观众数字以及未正式参加电影周而放映了同样四部印度影片的各电影院和电影放映队所拥有的观众数字，将达到三百多万人次。
    许多城市电影院的电影票，在电影周举行前即已预售一光。昆明观众在电影周开始前十天，便向各家电影院预订座券。沈阳各界观众预约登记包场人数达二十六万多人。仅这个预约包场的人数便已经比沈阳到二十二日止所统计的观众数字超过三万多人。济南仅一个职工剧院预售的电影票有八千多张。济南大观电影院只有一千一百个座位，在二十日晚放映“流浪者”，两场竟售出二千三百多张票子。哈尔滨各电影院在每晚都增卖了五十到一百张站票。旅大各电影院在观众要求下，都由原来的每天放映四场增加到八、九场，但仍不能满足观众的需要。有一天，中苏电影院已经一连放映了九场，可是挤满在门前的两三千名观众仍要求继续放映第十场和第十一场。许多观众在看了印度电影后，还重看一次、两次甚至三次。济南一个职工剧院放映“流浪者”上下集时，在这剧院连看两场的达百分之九十以上。各城市许多观众由于没有购到电影票纷纷要求电影院继续放映。由于在广大观众的热烈要求下，成都从二十四日起“两亩地”还将重放一周。其他许多城市也将应观众的要求，继续放映各印度影片。
    北京、上海、天津、沈阳、西安、济南、昆明等地各报刊都发表了有关印度电影事业和这次在中国放映的四部影片的评论、介绍和观后感等文章。这些文章的作者，有访问过印度的中国电影导演、演员和作家，有影评家、剧作家和艺术家，有大学教授和其他各界人士。影片“两亩地”的翻译者慕容婉儿在上海著文说：我在翻译这部影片时常被影片中的动人场面所吸引。昆明彝族作家李乔以“一部激动人心的影片——‘两亩地’”为题发表了文章，大力推荐这部优秀电影。西安的一位电影剧作家还对这部片子充满了民族色彩的音乐给予很高的评价。成都造纸厂工人看了“暴风雨”后，纷纷表示“对印度感到更加亲切了”。在南宁，汉、僮、苗、瑶、侗等民族的观众都非常喜爱“暴风雨”。北京市回民医院的一个观众在影院观众意见簿上写道：“流浪者”影片中表现了浓厚的东方抒情风味和充满了人民性的内容，实在使人难以遗忘。成都的四川省文史馆的工作人员看了“印度的艺术与建设”后认为对他们的工作有很大帮助。旅大各电影院还接到了观众寄来的许多欢迎和赞扬印度电影的信。
    在电影周开始前后，各地热烈展开了宣传工作。上海市文化局等单位曾举行电影讲座，向广大群众介绍印度电影的主题思想和艺术成就。中国电影发行公司山东办事处在电影周举行前二十天，便在济南最热闹的经二路装饰了一个画廊，和分批在二十个大商店的橱窗内展出了印度电影的画片，各影院也展出了影片中的剧照。在哈尔滨、旅大等地的许多单位都举行了电影座谈会，由观看过印度电影的人们座谈观后感。
