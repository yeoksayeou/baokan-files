Xinhua News Agency, 12th. In September, the first month of the 1955 cotton year, the amount of cotton purchased nationwide exceeded the purchase plan by more than 124%. Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Henan, Sichuan, Liaoning, Beijing, Tianjin and other twelve provinces and cities had the best purchase situation, all greatly overfulfilling the September purchase plan. In early October, the amount of cotton entering the market in many areas continued to increase. Hebei, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces could purchase 13 million to 16 million jin of seed cotton per day, which is much more than the average daily purchase volume in the monthly plan.

This year, most cotton-producing areas across the country have had good cotton harvests, and the cotton maturity period is generally ten days to half a month earlier than last year. In late August, cotton was generally available on the market in various cotton-producing areas. In the first half of this year, supply and marketing cooperatives carried out cotton pre-purchase work in various cotton-producing areas, and most of the commercial cotton has been pre-purchased by supply and marketing cooperatives. In July and August this year, the Party and government leading organizations and supply and marketing cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas used great efforts to educate cotton farmers to sell cotton to support national construction. After harvesting the cotton this year, cotton farmers in various places have been vying to sell cotton to the state. Since September, the amount of cotton entering the market in various cotton-producing areas has increased rapidly. 1952 was the year with the largest cotton purchase volume in the few years after liberation, but the cotton purchased in September of that year was less than half of the amount purchased in September this year.

At present, supply and marketing cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas are working hard to adapt their purchase, processing, and transportation capabilities to the situation of large quantities of cotton entering the market. Henan Province has further deployed cotton unified purchase work in accordance with the spirit of "quick collection, quick ginning, and quick delivery," and it is expected that commercial cotton will be basically purchased by the end of November. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan Province have more generally adopted the method of "dividing villages into zones and organizing cotton farmers to sell collectively" for purchasing, and it is expected that the annual unified purchase task will be completed by November. Many areas also organize agricultural production cooperatives to send cotton directly to processing plants for sale. Most of the power-driven cotton ginning factories in various cotton-producing areas have adjusted their labor organization and implemented multi-shift production, ginning cotton day and night. The counties in the Luoyang area of Henan Province also widely organized private cotton ginning carts and mobilized agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups to gin cotton, and then purchased their lint cotton and cotton seeds. In areas where supply and marketing cooperatives do not have much processing power and cotton farmers are accustomed to selling lint cotton, it is determined to implement the principle of "adapting to local conditions and acting according to capacity" to collect both seed cotton and lint cotton. Hanchuan, Jiangling and other counties in Hubei Province have carried out mutual adjustments between regions in areas with unbalanced processing capabilities. After these measures were taken in various places, the unreasonable inventory of seed cotton gradually decreased. In terms of transportation, various places have adopted the method of "those who can pull, pull; those who can carry, carry; those who can shoulder, shoulder," to organize various transportation forces to rush transportation vigorously, and strive to transfer cotton as soon as possible to supply textile industry production. Although there was widespread rainfall in various cotton-producing areas in September, which brought difficulties to transportation, the plan to deliver cotton to state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies was still overfulfilled.

### 各产棉区收成良好，棉花大量上市  全国九月份购棉计划超额完成

    各产棉区收成良好，棉花大量上市
    全国九月份购棉计划超额完成
    新华社十二日讯　一九五五年棉花年度的头一个月——九月份，全国收购的棉花超过收购计划百分之一百二十四以上。山东、河北、江苏、河南、四川、辽宁、北京、天津等十二个省市收购情况最好，都大大超额完成了九月份的收购计划。十月上旬，很多地区棉花上市量继续增加，河北、江苏、山东三省每天可收购籽棉一千三百万斤到一千六百万斤，超过月计划中的每天平均收购量很多。
    今年全国大多数产棉区棉花收成良好，棉花成熟期一般比去年提前十天到半个月。在八月下旬，各产棉区就普遍有棉花上市。今年上半年，供销合作社在各产棉区进行了棉花预购工作，绝大部分商品棉已为供销合作社所预购。各产棉区的党、政领导机构和供销合作社，在今年七、八月份以很大的力量对棉农进行了卖棉花支援国家建设的教育，各地棉农今年在收摘棉花以后，都争相把棉花卖给国家。九月以来，各产棉区棉花上市量增加很快。一九五二年是解放后几年中棉花收购量最多的一年，但那年九月份收购的棉花还不到今年九月收购数量的一半。
    各产棉区供销合作社目前正在努力使收购、加工、运输力量适应棉花大量上市的情况。河南省根据“快收、快轧、快交”的精神，进一步布置了棉花统购工作，预计在十一月底以前可把商品棉基本收购完毕。四川省各地供销合作社比较普遍地采用了“分村划片，组织棉农集体出售”的方法进行收购，预计到十一月就可完成全年的统购任务。很多地区还组织农业生产合作社把棉花直接送加工厂出售。各产棉区的动力轧花工厂大都调整了劳动组织，实行多班制生产，日夜不停地轧花。河南省洛阳专区各县还广泛组织民间轧花车并发动农业生产合作社和互助组轧花，然后收购他们的皮棉和棉籽。在供销合作社掌握加工力量不多而棉农又习惯出售皮棉的地区，确定按“因地制宜，量力而为”的原则，实行籽棉、皮棉兼收。湖北省汉川、江陵等县在加工能力不平衡的地区，进行了地区之间的相互调剂。各地采取这些措施以后，不合理的籽棉库存量便逐渐减少。在运输方面，各地采取“能拉的拉、能驮的驮、能扛的扛”的办法，组织各种运输力量大力赶运，争取尽快地把棉花调出供应纺织工业生产。九月份各产棉区虽然普遍降雨，给运输带来了困难，但向国营花纱布公司运交棉花的计划仍超额完成。
