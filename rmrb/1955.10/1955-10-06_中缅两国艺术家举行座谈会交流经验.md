Xinhua News Agency, October 4th: Chinese and Burmese artists held a symposium on the afternoon of the 4th to exchange experiences in the arts.

    The symposium was divided into three groups: music, dance, and drama.

    In the music group, the famous Burmese musician and recipient of the highest national award of the Union of Burma, U Ba Than, introduced the Burmese classical instrument, the harp, which has a history of over two thousand years, and the popular folk instrument, the saung gauk. He and other Burmese musicians also played a Burmese love song, "Song of Anticipation," and a piece called "Chinese Tune." These two pieces aroused great interest among the Chinese musicians. They told their Burmese friends that "Song of Anticipation" was very similar to the Chaozhou tune of southern China, and "Chinese Tune" was full of the unique melodies of northern Chinese music. The Chinese classical instrument qin player, Zha Fuxi, learned the basic playing method of the harp from U Ba Than. Ren Tongxiang, a Chinese folk instrument player, played the sheng, a unique Chinese instrument, which won applause from the audience.

    In the dance group, Chen Jinqing, vice president of the Beijing Dance School, answered questions raised by the Burmese artists about the development of Chinese dance and how to train young dancers. U Dong Sein, a Burmese dancer and teacher at the Yangon National Music and Drama School, introduced the history of Burmese classical dance, which originated from Buddhism, and the characteristics of popular folk dances. He also demonstrated the steps of the folk dance, the long drum dance. This dance is a type of Burmese rural paddy field dance, in which the performer hangs a three-foot-long "elephant foot drum" around their body, and rhythmically beats the drum with their palms, fists, elbows, heels, and knees while dancing. When U Dong Sein learned that the ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province, China, also have this "elephant foot drum" dance, and that it is very similar to the Burmese one, he happily said: This is another proof that China and Myanmar have many common points in culture. He also asked one of his female students, Ma Aye Kyin, to perform the basic steps and training process of Burmese classical dance. Dai Ailian, a Chinese dancer and principal of the Beijing Dance School, told the Burmese dancers that China would send people to accompany them on their performances in various places in order to learn Burmese dance.

    At the symposium of the drama group, the Chinese playwright Ma Yanxiang introduced the development of Peking Opera and local operas since the liberation, and answered questions about the subject matter of Chinese opera. The Burmese playwright U Po Way also gave a detailed introduction to Burmese court and religious dramas, as well as the development of folk drama after Burmese independence.

    At the symposium, the Chinese Musicians Association, the Chinese Dramatists Association, and the Chinese Dance Research Association presented the Burmese Union Cultural Delegation with gifts of Chinese musical instruments, sheet music, Chinese dance models, and stills of Chinese drama performances.

    中缅两国艺术家举行座谈会交流经验
    新华社四日讯中国和缅甸的艺术家们四日下午举行座谈会，交流了两国在艺术方面的经验。
    座谈会分为音乐、舞蹈和戏剧三个小组举行。
    在音乐组里，著名的缅甸音乐家、缅甸联邦最高国家奖章获得者吴巴丹介绍了有二千多年历史的缅甸古典乐器竖琴和民间流行的乐器箧琴，并和其他的缅甸音乐家演奏了缅甸的一首情歌“期待之歌”和一首名为“中国之调”的曲子。这两个曲子引起了中国音乐家很大的兴趣。他们告诉缅甸朋友们，“期待之歌”很像中国南方潮州的调子，“中国之调”充满了中国北部音乐所特有的调子。中国的古典乐器七弦琴演奏家查阜西向吴巴丹学习了竖琴的基本演奏法。中国民间乐器演奏家任同祥演奏了中国特有的乐器——笙，博得了全场的掌声。
    在舞蹈组里，北京舞蹈学校副校长陈锦清回答了缅甸艺术家们所提出的有关中国舞蹈发展情况和如何培养青年舞蹈家等问题，缅甸舞蹈家、仰光国立音乐戏剧学校教员吴东阵介绍了从佛教中产生的缅甸古典舞的历史和流行于民间的舞蹈的特点，他还表演了民间舞蹈长鼓舞的步法。这种舞蹈是缅甸农村稻田舞的一种，表演者身上挂着一面长三尺的“象脚鼓”，一边舞蹈一边以手掌、拳、肘、脚跟和膝盖有节奏地击鼓。当吴东阵知道在中国的云南省的少数民族中也有这种“象脚鼓”舞，而且和缅甸的很相似时，他高兴地说：这就是中缅两国在文化方面有许多共同点的又一证明。他还请他的一位女学生马唉建表演了缅甸古典舞的基本步法和训练的过程。中国舞蹈家、北京舞蹈学校校长戴爱莲告诉缅甸舞蹈家们，中国将派人随从他们到各地演出，以便学习缅甸的舞蹈。
    中国戏剧家马彦祥在戏剧组的座谈会上介绍了京剧、地方戏曲在解放后发展的情况，回答了关于中国戏曲的取材等问题。缅甸剧作家吴坡韦也详细地介绍了缅甸宫庭和宗教戏剧以及缅甸独立后民间戏剧的发展情况。
    在座谈会上，中国音乐家协会、中国戏剧家协会和中国舞蹈艺术研究会，分别向缅甸联邦文化代表团赠送了中国乐器、乐谱、中国舞蹈模型和中国戏剧演出的剧照等礼品。
