During the film week, an Indian documentary short film selection "Indian Art and Construction" and three Indian feature films "Two Acres of Land," "Storm," and "The Vagabond" will be screened.

"Indian Art and Construction" includes seven excellent short documentaries, which respectively introduce the Ajanta Caves, the most famous and magnificent ancient architecture in western India, the beautiful nature and abundant natural resources of Travancore-Cochin State in southern India, the great engineering project of the Indian people to control the Sutlej River, various handicrafts in India, the outstanding achievements of ancient architecture and sculpture on the Seven Pagodas Island on the east coast of India, the water conservancy construction of the Mahanadi River in India, and nearly five thousand years of Indian sculpture, painting, pottery sculpture and casting art.

The feature film "Two Acres of Land" shows the simple, upright, kind qualities and the spirit of friendship, mutual assistance, and unity of the Indian working people.
