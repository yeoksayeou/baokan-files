Xinhua News Agency, October 19th – According to USIS reports: US Secretary of State Dulles answered questions regarding the Sino-American ambassadorial talks at a press conference held in Washington on October 18th.

Dulles said his view on the Sino-American talks was: "The purpose of this meeting is to discuss issues directly related to our (China and the US) two countries. I believe we should fully explore and utilize all the possibilities of this meeting before considering the possibility of a second meeting. And so far, I think we are far from exhausting the possibilities of the current meeting."

When asked about the progress of the talks, Dulles said: The discussion on the first item on the agenda—namely, the repatriation of civilians on both sides who wish to return home—resulted in an agreement. We are now proceeding to discuss the second item on the agenda. However, Dulles also said that the United States "simultaneously reserves the right to reopen discussion on the first item at any time if it appears that the agreement is not being faithfully implemented." Dulles continued: Under the second item, the issue of renouncing the use of force has been discussed, and the embargo issue will also be discussed.

Dulles stated that he could not answer some of the questions raised by reporters, "because we have an understanding that neither party can report the content of what is said at these meetings without the consent of both parties."

One reporter asked if he anticipated that the Sino-American ambassadorial talks would continue during the meeting of the foreign ministers of the four powers in Geneva. Dulles replied: "I anticipate that it will, yes."

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, October 19th (TASS) – US Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference on October 18th, answering questions from reporters, that he would meet with President Eisenhower on October 19th to finalize plans for the upcoming four-power foreign ministers' meeting in Geneva.

Dulles said that on his way to Geneva, he planned to visit Rome and meet with the British and French foreign ministers in Paris. He will then attend a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council.

Answering other questions, Dulles said that he believes there are now more opportunities to take practical steps to resolve major international differences. Dulles said that the upcoming foreign ministers' meeting should be considered the second stage of implementing the "Geneva spirit."

Dulles mentioned Eisenhower's view that the upcoming Geneva meeting would be a "serious test" of the "Geneva spirit." Dulles said that he believes there is now a not-bad chance of creating the hope that progress will be made on all three items on the agenda.

One reporter asked Dulles how to reconcile his talk today with his previous remarks on the Soviet attitude. Dulles said that he does not believe that there is any inconsistency between his hopes today and his previous "warnings" about Soviet policy. He added that people have expressed hopes for the outcome of the Geneva Conference that go beyond the "realistic opportunities" of this meeting. Dulles said that he does not endorse these hopes, but believes that the realistic opportunities for the upcoming meeting are now about as great as the Western countries believed they were at the time of the Geneva Summit of the Four Powers, which should be only the first stage of East-West negotiations. Dulles said he hoped the Geneva Conference would make progress on the issue of German reunification. However, he does not expect German reunification to be "completely achieved or guaranteed" at the upcoming meeting. Dulles reiterated that he hopes that the various proposals aimed at unifying Germany and ensuring European security will help the Western countries and the Soviet Union to come closer together at the upcoming meeting.

    杜勒斯在记者招待会上谈中美会谈等问题
    新华社十九日讯　据美国新闻处消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯十月十八日在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上曾回答了关于中美两国大使级会谈的问题。
    杜勒斯说，他对于中美会谈的看法是：“这次会谈的目的就是要讨论对我们（中美）两国直接有关的问题，我认为应该充分探讨和尽量利用这次会议的各种可能性，然后再考虑可能的第二次会议的问题。而到现在为止，我认为，我们还远没有利用完目前这次会议的可能性。”
    在记者问到会谈的情况时，杜勒斯说：第一项议程——那就是遣返双方愿意回国的平民——的讨论结果是达成了一项协议。我们现在已在进而讨论第二项议程。但是，杜勒斯又说美国还“同时保留权利可以随时重新讨论第一项议程，如果看来协议没有被忠实执行的话。”杜勒斯接着说：在第二项议程下，放弃使用武力问题已经讨论了，禁运问题也将讨论。
    杜勒斯表示他不能答复记者们提出的有一些问题，“因为我们有谅解，除了双方同意外，任何一方都不能报道在这些会议上所讲的话的内容。”
    有记者问他是否预料在四国外交部长在日内瓦开会期间中美两国大使级会谈将继续进行。杜勒斯回答说：“我预料会这样，是这样。”
    新华社十九日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿十九日讯：美国国务卿杜勒斯十月十八日在记者招待会上回答记者的问题时说道，十月十九日他将同艾森豪威尔总统会晤，以便最后讨论有关即将举行的四国外交部长日内瓦会议的计划。
    杜勒斯说道，在前往日内瓦途中，他打算访问罗马以及在巴黎同英法两国外交部长会晤。然后他将参加北大西洋公约组织理事会的会议。
    杜勒斯在回答其他问题时说道，他认为，现在有更多的机会来采取解决主要的国际分歧的实际措施。杜勒斯说道，应该认为即将举行的外交部长会议是贯彻“日内瓦精神”的第二阶段。
    杜勒斯提起艾森豪威尔的这种意见：即将举行的日内瓦会议将是“日内瓦精神”的“严重考验”。杜勒斯说道，他认为，现在有不坏的机会使人产生这种希望：在议程的所有三项问题上将取得进展。
    有一个记者问杜勒斯，怎样把他今天的谈话同以前他就苏联态度所发表的言论调和起来。杜勒斯说道，他不认为，在他的今天的希望和以前对苏联政策的“警告”之间有任何不协调的地方。他又说，人们对日内瓦会议的结果表示了超出这次会见的“实际机会”范围的希望。杜勒斯说，他不赞同这些希望，但是又认为，即将举行的会议的实际机会，现在大约同西方国家在四国政府首脑日内瓦会议时所认为的一样大，而四国政府首脑日内瓦会议应该只是东西方谈判的第一阶段。杜勒斯说，他希望日内瓦会议将在德国统一的问题方面取得进展。但是，他不指望在即将举行的会议上德国的统一“或是完全达到或是得到保障”。杜勒斯重复说，他希望，关于旨在统一德国和保障欧洲安全的各种建议，将有助于西方国家和苏联在即将举行的会议上更加接近起来。
