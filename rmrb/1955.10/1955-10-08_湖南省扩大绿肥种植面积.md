Hunan Province plans to plant 12 million mu of green manure this autumn to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage next spring. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are supplying farmers with green manure seeds in a steady stream. Many areas are also holding training classes or organizing symposiums to impart the cultivation techniques of planting green manure.

The broad masses of farmers are very enthusiastic about planting green manure. After Yintian District in Xiangtan County summarized that green manure played a significant role in this year's bumper harvest, the masses' enthusiasm for planting green manure greatly increased. The district plans to plant more than 30,000 mu of green manure. More than 10,000 mu of early-sown seeds have grown to more than half an inch deep. By early September, farmers in Nan County had planted nearly 7,000 mu of green manure. This year, the county plans to plant 70,000 mu of green manure, an increase of 27 percent over 1953. Shaoyang Prefecture plans to plant 1 million mu of green manure this year, an increase of 42 percent over last year.

    湖南省扩大绿肥种植面积
  　湖南省今年秋季计划种植绿肥一千二百万亩，解决明春肥料不足的问题。各地供销合作社正源源供应农民绿肥种子。许多地区还举办训练班或组织座谈会，传授种植绿肥的栽培技术。
    广大农民对种植绿肥的积极性很高。湘潭县银田区总结出绿肥在今年丰产中起了很大作用后，群众种植绿肥的积极性大为提高，全区计划种绿肥三万多亩。下种较早的一万多亩草子已长有半寸多深。南县农民到九月上旬止，已种下绿肥近七千亩。该县今年计划种植绿肥七万亩，比一九五三年增加百分之二十七。邵阳专区今年计划种植绿肥一百万亩，比去年增加百分之四十二。
