    Ideological Work in Promoting the Group Economic Accounting System
    中共五三工厂第二车间支部 (CPC Fifth Third Factory Second Workshop Branch)
    In April of this year, the Second Workshop of the Fifth Third Factory, following the instructions of the factory's Party Committee and management, began to implement the group economic accounting system. The administration organized relevant staff to study in advance and conducted pilot projects. From May, it was fully implemented in the entire workshop. In the first month, many new aspects appeared in production. First, it reversed the phenomenon of being slack at the beginning of the month, tense in the middle, and rushing at the end, which had occurred in the past few months, ensuring that product progress remained basically balanced and product quality gradually improved. A comparison between April, when the group economic accounting system was not yet implemented, and May, when it was implemented, shows this clearly. In April, the initial quality dropped from 98.18 percent to 97.78 percent, while in May, the quality consistently rose, from 98.22 percent to 98.28 percent. At the same time, intermittent work hours were also greatly reduced in May compared to April; tool consumption in May saved 849 more pieces than in April, greatly exceeding the planned figure. The ideological style of employees has also improved, and everyone is more concerned about production than in the past. After the economic accounting results of each process were announced in early May, the foremen and workers of each work section rushed to see them, some copying down the calculated figures and carefully comparing them, others finding the reasons for not meeting the targets during the comparison and inspection, and proposing solutions. All of this proves that the implementation of the group economic accounting system is the best way to ensure continuous and comprehensive conservation and a good way to ensure the completion of production tasks.
    However, the implementation of the group economic accounting system can never be smooth sailing. The Second Workshop encountered various obstacles in its implementation, the main obstacle being ideological. Therefore, to promote the group economic accounting system, it is necessary to do a good job in ideological work. To do a good job in ideological work, it is necessary to go deep into the masses and discover ideological problems. In the Second Workshop, we discovered the following ideological problems through various channels:
    The first is fear of trouble and difficulty. Some comrades in the workshop's functional groups had this idea when they began to study the instructions and documents on economic accounting issued by higher authorities. For example, it was stipulated that the pilot work should be led by the workshop, but the head of the workshop's business group did not do this work, and at the pilot report meeting, he said: "I have been very busy these days, and I have not done much pilot work. Let the comrades in the section talk about it." Some people in the material supply group said: "There are too many forms and reports at the beginning and end of the month, and now we have to fill in quota registration cards, so there is no time to do accounting work." These people regarded the promotion of economic accounting as a burden. Among the workers, especially the veteran workers, many also lacked confidence in the promotion of economic accounting. Foreman Lin Xiyuan believed that he had little education and was old and could not learn it, so he asked the leadership to transfer him to another job.
    The second is the idea that it has nothing to do with oneself. Some comrades in the technical group regarded the promotion of economic accounting as a matter for the workshop's functional groups. Some workers also believe that "I am in charge of watching the machines and working, and what accounting has nothing to do with me."
    The third is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the economic accounting system. Foreman Guan Wenxiang is an example. One night shift, a worker in Guan Wenxiang's group became ill and could not work. Under these circumstances, a worker should be borrowed from another group to replace him. However, he one-sidedly believed that borrowing a worker would waste the group's man-hour target; therefore, he did it himself. As a result, not only did he not do it well, but he produced more than 190 defective products, which were mixed into a large batch of good products. Because his own group could not handle them the next day, twenty-four workers were borrowed from another process, affecting the quality target of this group which was unable to complete its plan for a month.
    After research and analysis, our branch committee believes that the above ideological problems are mainly caused by insufficient understanding of the significance of promoting the group economic accounting system. Therefore, we decided to adopt various positive educational methods to solve them.
    We held small exhibitions. The exhibitions were in two forms: one was an exhibition for the entire workshop, the content of which was to explain the significance of promoting the economic accounting system with text and charts, and at the same time, to exhibit the actual objects of various wastes in the workshop, so that everyone could see the content and benefits of the economic accounting system from the exhibition; the other was a group exhibition, the content of which was the same as that of the workshop, but with examples from the group itself. These two exhibitions helped the employees to establish the idea that waste must be overcome. For example, after the comrades of Group 301 watched the workshop exhibition, they began to study ways to overcome waste.
    At the same time, we paid attention to solving the objective difficulties in promoting the economic accounting system. Most of the thirty foremen in the Second Workshop only had a primary school education, and some were illiterate. It was more difficult for these people to learn the economic accounting system. If the foremen did not learn well first, it would be impossible to carry out economic accounting in the group. Therefore, training the foremen became the key to whether economic accounting could be carried out well. Secondly, it was also important to train the backbone members and propagandists of the production groups. Only when they mastered the methods of economic accounting could they play a leading role and publicize the benefits of the economic accounting system to the masses. Therefore, at the beginning of the economic accounting work, we cooperated with the administration to hold a training class to organize the above-mentioned personnel to study. Through this study, not only did these people master the methods of economic accounting, but they also had a correct attitude towards economic accounting, and many ideological problems were solved as a result.
    We used the methods of discussion and individual understanding to discover problems in the promotion of economic accounting. Once, we used this method and discovered that because the economic accounting system was not publicized in a popular way, and the economic accounting indicators themselves were difficult to understand, the foremen and workers did not understand the economic indicators that were issued. The workers reflected: "Economic accounting indicators are not easy to understand!" Based on this situation, we and the relevant departments of the administration studied in detail and decided to popularize the indicators, and then explain these popularized indicators to the foremen, which improved the foremen's confidence in learning the accounting methods; finally, we conveyed these popularized indicators to the workers, who understood them at a glance, which helped the promotion of the economic accounting system.
    In this promotion of economic accounting work, we also adopted the method of advanced leading the backward. For example, we asked Foreman Zhang Mingpu, who was old and had little education, to introduce his experience in overcoming difficulties and implementing economic accounting to other foremen at the administrative meeting. In his introduction, he said: "At the beginning of the promotion of economic accounting, I was also worried that I had little education and could not learn it well, but after studying with the group leader, I wrote the numbers on the group competition chart and mobilized everyone to find the reasons why the group's indicators were completed well or badly. In this way, relying on the strength of the collective, I learned while doing, and I learned it." Zhang Mingpu's experience greatly inspired other foremen and increased their confidence in overcoming difficulties.
    Propaganda and mobilization work is an indispensable link in mobilizing the masses. At the beginning of our promotion of the economic accounting system, because we did not grasp this work tightly, many ideological problems occurred among the masses. After the branch committee discovered this problem, it immediately tried to reverse it. In addition to organizing Party and non-Party backbone members to study the indicators, the Party's propagandists strengthened oral propaganda, the workshop's internal newspaper launched commendations and criticisms, the trade union club held lectures, the workshop's broadcasting room broadcasted, and the trade union group leaders were organized to explain how to combine economic accounting work with labor competitions, mobilizing the masses to launch competitions.

    推行小组经济核算制中的思想工作
    中共五三工厂第二车间支部
    五三厂二车间在今年四月份根据本厂党委和厂部的指示，开始推行小组经济核算制。行政方面事先组织有关工作人员进行学习，并进行试点工作，五月份起，在全车间全面推行。第一个月生产上就出现了许多新的气象。首先是扭转了过去几个月中月初松、月中紧和月末突击的现象，使产品进度基本上保持了均衡，产品质量也逐渐提高。拿尚未实行小组经济核算制的四月份和实行了小组经济核算的五月份作一个比较，就可看出这一点。四月份初质量由百分之九十八点一八下降到百分之九十七点七八，而五月份质量却一直是上升的，由百分之九十八点二二，增加到百分之九十八点二八。同时，间断工时五月份比四月份也降低了很多；工具消耗五月份比四月份多节省了八百四十九件，大大地超过了计划数字。职工的思想作风也有了提高，大家比过去更关心生产。五月上旬各工序的经济核算结果公布后，各工段的工长和工人都争先去看，有的将核算出的数字抄下来，认真地进行对照，有的在对照检查中找出了达不到指标的原因，并提出了解决的办法。所有这些，都证明了推行小组经济核算制，是保证经常进行全面节约的最好形式，也是保证完成生产任务的好办法。
    但是，推行小组经济核算制决不可能是一帆风顺的，二车间推行中就遇到了各种各样的障碍，而其中主要的障碍是思想方面的。因此，要推行小组经济核算制，就要做好思想工作。要做好思想工作，就要深入群众，发现思想问题。在二车间，当时我们通过多方面的了解，发现有下面几种思想问题：
    第一种是怕麻烦，怕困难。在开始学习上级有关推行经济核算制指示和文件时，车间职能组一些同志就有这种思想。例如规定试点工作是以车间为主的，但车间业务组负责人却没有去做这一工作，在试点汇报会上就说这样的话：“我这几天很忙，试点工作没有做什么，还是让科里的同志来谈谈。”材料供应组有些人则说：“月初和月末表报太多，这回又加上填限额登记卡片，没有时间做核算工作。”这些人把推行经济核算制当成了负担。而工人中，特别是老工人中，也有不少人对推行经济核算制没有信心。工长林锡元就认为自己文化低，年纪大，学不了，因而向领导提出调动工作的要求。
    第二种是与己无关的思想。技术组一些同志把推行经济核算制看作是车间职能组的事。工人中也有人认为“我是看管机台干活的，什么核算不核算，同我无关”。
    第三种是对经济核算制缺少全面的认识。工长关文祥就是一个例子。有一天夜班生产时，关文祥所属的小组里有一名工人得病不能上班。在这种情况下，应该由别的小组借一名工人来代替。但他片面地认为借入一名工人，组里的工时指标就要浪费；因此，他自己动手来干。结果不但没做好，而且出了一百九十多件废品，这些废品又混到大批良品里去。第二天本组不能处理，就由另外工序借来二十四名工人，影响了本小组的质量指标一个月完不成计划。
    我们支委会经过研究和分析，认为上面这些思想问题，主要是对推行小组经济核算制的意义认识不足造成的。因此，我们决定采取各种正面教育的方法予以解决。
    我们举办了小型展览会，展览会分两种形式：一种是全车间的展览会，内容是用文字和图表说明推行经济核算制的意义，同时展出车间各种浪费的实物，让大家从展览中可以看出经济核算制的内容和好处；另一种是小组展览会，展览的内容同车间相同，不过是本小组的事例。这两种展览，帮助职工们树立了必须克服浪费的思想。如三○一小组同志看完车间展览会后就着手研究克服浪费的办法。
    同时，我们注意解决推行经济核算制中的客观困难。二车间三十名工长，大部分只有高小文化程度，个别的还是文盲，这些人学习经济核算制是比较吃力的。如果工长不首先学好，就无法在小组中进行经济核算工作。因此，训练工长就成为经济核算能否开展得好的关键。其次，训练生产小组骨干分子和宣传员也是重要的，只有他们掌握了经济核算的方法，才能发挥带头作用，才能向群众去宣传经济核算制的好处。为此，当经济核算工作一开始，我们就配合行政举办了一个训练班，组织上列人员进行学习。通过这次学习，不但使这些人掌握了经济核算的方法，而且对经济核算有了正确的态度，不少思想问题因此得到解决。
    我们采用座谈和个别了解的方法，来发现推行经济核算中的问题。有一次我们运用了这个方法，就发现了由于没有通俗宣传经济核算制，加上经济核算指标本身难懂，所以下达的经济指标工长和工人都不很懂。工人反映：“经济核算指标这玩艺不好懂！”根据这一情况，我们和行政有关科具体研究后，决定把指标通俗化，然后对工长讲解这种通俗化的指标，提高了工长学会核算方法的信心；最后把这种通俗化的指标传达到工人中去，工人一看就懂，这就帮助了经济核算制的推行。
    在这次推行经济核算工作中，我们还采用了先进带动落后的方法。例如我们请年纪大、文化低的工长张明普在行政会议上向其他工长介绍他克服困难，贯彻经济核算的经验，他在介绍当中说：“在推行经济核算开始时，我也顾虑到自己文化低，学不好，但和小组长一起研究后，把数字写在小组竞赛图板上，发动大家一起来找小组指标完成好坏的原因。这样依靠集体的力量，一边做，一边学，我也就学会了。”张明普的经验给其他工长有很大的启发，提高了他们克服困难的信心。
    宣传鼓动工作是发动群众不可缺少的环节。我们在推行经济核算制开始时，因为对这一工作抓得不紧，所以群众中发生了不少思想问题。支委会发现这个问题后，立即设法扭转，除组织党内外骨干分子学习指标外，党的宣传员加强了口头宣传，车间机关报展开了表扬和批评；工会俱乐室举办了讲座，车间广播室进行广播，并组织工会组长讲解把经济核算工作同劳动竞赛结合起来的方法，发动群众展开竞赛。
