Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, October 14th: The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council continued its meetings on the evening of the 12th and the afternoon of the 13th.

    On the evening of the 12th, Indian representative D.D. Kosambi spoke. He said that the Indian people and government advocate the peaceful resolution of all disputes through negotiations. Kosambi emphasized that the People's Republic of China should obtain the legitimate right to participate in all international conferences that resolve important international issues. He also said that the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council should take measures to expose, in the face of world opinion, those actions that sharpen the international situation and the threat of war.

    In his speech, Soviet representative Ilya Ehrenburg pointed out that the Geneva Conference laid the foundation for the beginning of the elimination of fear, which is a great victory for the forces of peace. However, many newspapers and radio stations have recently begun to revive the Cold War. Speaking about the German question, Ehrenburg expressed his hope to see Germany become a unified country that does not participate in military alliances and does not threaten its neighbors and peace. He suggested that the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council call on public opinion to do everything possible to ensure that the spirit shown by the Geneva Four-Power Summit is victorious.

    At the afternoon meeting on the 13th, Argentine representative Maria Rosa Oliver spoke first. She said that the Argentine people and the people of all countries in Latin America firmly advocate giving the People's Republic of China its legitimate seat in the United Nations and realizing the principles announced in Bandung.

    Canadian representative James Gareth Endicott pointed out the importance of the results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit. He said that during the future Geneva Conference, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council should mobilize all the strength of the people of all countries to promote the conclusion of an agreement at the conference.

    Italian representative Emilio Sereni emphasized that the main task of the world peace movement lies in mobilizing public opinion to strive for the implementation of a policy of negotiation, to oppose the policy of military blocs, and to oppose the establishment of military bases on the territories of other countries.

    Representative of the Federal Republic of Germany, E. Eckert, emphasized that public opinion should now focus on the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference that will discuss the German question.

    The following also spoke at the meeting: Brazilian representative José Flota Moreira, Australian representative William Morrow, Japanese representative Yoshitaro Hirano, French representative Eugénie Cotton, and Syrian representative Mustafa Amin.
