Xinhua News Agency, October 27th: The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a decision on October 26th regarding the convocation of a Youth Afforestation Conference for the five provinces (autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan. This conference is scheduled to be held on March 1, 1956, in Yan'an, our glorious revolutionary holy land.

This conference is convened in accordance with the needs of the plan formulated by the Party and the government to control the Yellow River's flood damage and develop its water resources. According to the provisions of this plan, not only should a series of large-scale reservoirs and dams be built, but large-scale soil and water conservation work should also be carried out in the middle reaches area. The middle reaches area of the Yellow River in Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan has loose soil and few trees, and soil erosion is very serious. Almost nine-tenths of the Yellow River's large amount of sediment comes from here. Therefore, carrying out a mass afforestation movement in this area has a decisive effect on maintaining soil and water, that is, on reducing the Yellow River's sediment and increasing agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production.

The decision to convene this conference stipulates that in addition to representatives from the five provinces (autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan, other provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government should also send a small number of representatives. The total number of participants in the conference will be one thousand.

The decision also stipulates that the main content of the conference will be to hear reports from representatives of the Communist Youth League committees of the five provinces (autonomous region) on the youth afforestation plans of their respective provinces (autonomous region), the report from the representative of the Communist Youth League Yan'an County Committee on the youth afforestation plan of Yan'an County, as well as speeches from representatives of local Communist Youth League branches, young staff members of afforestation stations and nurseries, and young afforestation activists. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League will also make a report at the conference entitled "Let's Green Our Great Motherland." The conference also plans to pass a proposal to designate one day in spring and autumn each year as National Youth Tree Planting Day.

The decision requires the Communist Youth League provincial committees, autonomous region committees, and municipal committees directly under the central government, as well as the county (city, banner) committees participating in the meeting, to immediately discuss this decision, summarize the experience of youth afforestation in their respective regions, formulate specific afforestation plans for the future, select people to attend the conference, and mobilize the broad masses of young people to greet the convening of the conference with practical actions of tree planting and afforestation.

    团中央决定召开青年造林大会
    新华社二十七日讯　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会二十六日发布关于召开陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古、河南五省（自治区）青年造林大会的决定。这个大会定于一九五六年三月一日在我国光辉的革命圣地——延安举行。
    这个大会，是根据党和政府制定的根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利计划的需要而召开的。按照这一计划的规定，不仅要修建一系列规模巨大的水库和拦河坝，而且要在中游地区开展大规模的水土保持工作。陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古、河南黄河中游地区，土质松散，树木很少，水土流失十分严重，黄河的大量泥砂几乎有十分之九是从这里来的。因此，在这个地区开展群众性的造林运动，对保持水土，也就是对减少黄河的泥砂，增加农业、林业和畜牧业的生产，有着决定性的作用。
    召开这个大会的决定中规定除陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古、河南五省（自治区）派代表出席外，其他各省、自治区、直辖市也各选派少数代表。参加大会的人数共为一千名。
    决定还规定大会的主要内容将听取有关五省（自治区）的青年团委员会代表分别所作的关于本省（自治区）青年造林计划的报告，青年团延安县委员会代表所作的关于延安县青年造林计划的报告，以及各地团支部代表，造林站、苗圃的青年工作人员和青年造林积极分子的发言；青年团中央也将在会上作“把我们的伟大的祖国绿化起来”的报告。大会还准备通过一项在每年春秋两季各选定一日为全国青少年植树造林日的建议。
    决定要求青年团各省委、自治区委、直辖市委及参加会议的各县（市、旗）委立即讨论这一决定，总结本地区青年造林的经验，订出今后的具体造林计划，选定出席大会的人，并且动员广大青年以植树造林的实际行动来迎接大会的召开。
