    An Excellent Friendly Match
    ——A Record of the Indian National Volleyball Team vs. the Beijing Team
    Cheng Zhi
    In the newly built Beijing Gymnasium, yesterday evening (October 26th), the first group of visitors from our friendly neighbor, the Indian National Volleyball Team, was received. More than 6,000 spectators watched the guests' wonderful performance with great excitement and warmly praised their tenacious fighting spirit.

    The match began amid thunderous applause. The Indian team fielded Mankoo, Khalid, Arunachalam, Buchira Maiah, Gupta, and Chopra. Facing the visitors was the Beijing team: Wu Limin, Li Ceda, Zhang Ran, Jiang Zhenhong, Ye Zhuo, and Zeng Rongle. The friendly match adopted the internationally popular six-person volleyball format. The skills of both sides were evenly matched, and the match was tense from the start. The Beijing team scored first after gaining the serve. The Indian team immediately organized an attack. Mankoo scored over the net with a hard spike set by Arunachalam, and the situation on the court became a seesaw, with both sides exerting strong spiking power to compete for the serve. After tying at one point each, the Beijing team blocked too early, and Arunachalam spiked into the gap, giving the Indian team a 2-1 lead. Afterwards, both sides alternated between offense and defense, and the competition became more intense. The Beijing team gradually became more active. Wu Limin's hook shot and Zeng Rongle's hard chop over the net were successful one after another. The score was 8-3, and the Beijing team had gained the initiative. Seeing the opponent's offensive momentum increasing, the Indian team requested a time-out to discuss countermeasures. When the game resumed, the Indian team adopted a spread-out tactic, which immediately proved effective. But the Beijing team was still fierce. At this time, Mankoo's many advantages gradually came into play. Seeing that the Beijing team's spikes and blocks were of considerable level, he used clever dinks and soft spikes into the gaps to try to block the opponent's attack. After the Indian team won the serve, Chopra saved the Beijing team's Ye Zhuo's sharp spike from the sideline, and Khalid lifted it back to Mankoo. Mankoo jumped up, turned around, and spiked straight down, 11-7, the scores between the two sides gradually narrowed. The Beijing team also used spread-out spikes and flexible cover-ups to defend against the opponent's soft spikes. After several contests, the Beijing team finally regained the serve. Zhang Ran served quickly and hard, and Mankoo received it back with a low hand, landing right in front of the Beijing team's net. Ye Zhuo chopped straight down, followed by Wu Limin spiking a very well-placed hard ball. The Beijing team took advantage of the situation to strike hard, winning the first game 15-8.

    After the start of the second game, the situation on the court became even more tense. Mankoo spiked three diagonal hard balls in a row at the net, but they were all saved by Jiang Zhenhong of the Beijing team. The spectators in the stands applauded warmly for the Indian team's spiking skills and the Beijing team's agile saves. But the Indian team had the upper hand. The Beijing team's offensive methods began to diversify. First, Zhang Ran, Wu Limin, and Li Ceda organized a quick set play to win back the serve, but it was taken back by Gupta's spike. The Indian team took advantage of its strong attacking power in the front row to launch a fierce attack, and the score was 7-2, with the Beijing team still at a disadvantage. Then, the Beijing team reorganized its echelon attack, and Zhang Ran scored again with a dink, and the score was 8-8, the first time the two teams were tied. Afterwards, each point cost a great deal of effort, but the Indian team maintained its lead. The Beijing team used more flexible and clever offensive tactics, scoring four points in a row, and finally won another game 15-10.

    In the third game, the Indian team replaced Khalid and Arunachalam with Raji and Sagar, while the Beijing team continued to play with the original players. After the Indian team changed players, the offense was more steady than before. Sagar set the ball at a moderate height. Mankoo was particularly active at the net. Whenever this agile Indian national volleyball player dinked or spiked the ball over the net, the audience applauded warmly. The Beijing team played many good balls using quick-set attacks and echelon tactics. In the end, they won the third game 15-10.

    Although the Indian National Volleyball Team suffered a defeat in the preliminary round, they showed that they are a team with excellent skills, and they have a considerable grasp of spiking and blocking. Due to the players' unfamiliarity with the climate of northern China, the display of their skills was obviously affected, but their spirit of continuous struggle left a deep impression on people.

    一场出色的友谊赛
    ——记印度国家排球队对北京队的比赛

    在新落成的北京体育馆里，昨天（十月二十六日）晚上，接待了来自友好近邻的第一批来访者——印度国家排球队。六千多观众，怀着十分激动的心情鉴赏了客人们的精采表演，并对他们顽强的奋战精神给予热烈的赞扬。
    球赛在雷般的掌声中开始。印度队上场的是：曼库、哈利德、阿鲁纳查兰、布奇拉迈亚、古普塔和乔普拉；接战来访者的是北京队：伍理民、李策大、张然、江振洪、叶灼和曾荣乐。友谊比赛采用国际流行的六人排球。两方球技不相上下，一接战就显得十分紧张。北京队在取得发球权后先开纪录。印度队立即组织进攻。曼库得阿鲁纳查兰举球硬杀过网，场上形成拉锯情况，双方为争夺发球权都发挥了强劲的扣杀力量。在打成一比一平以后，北京队拦网过早，被阿鲁纳查兰杀球进空档，印度队以二比一领先。过后双方互有攻守，竞争更形剧烈。北京队逐渐活跃。伍理民钩臂杀球，曾荣乐硬劈过网都连连得手。场上纪录是八比三，北京队已取得主动权。印度队鉴于对方攻势猛烈增长，场外要求暂停商讨对策。在继续比赛的时候，印度队采取拉开战术，立见功效。但北京队仍然猛勇。这时候，印度队曼库的许多优点渐渐发挥出来，他看见北京队扣杀、拦网都具相当水平，即用机智吊球和软杀进空档的办法竭力阻拦对方进攻。在印度队争得发球权后，乔普拉从边线处救回北京队叶灼猛杀过来的急球，哈利德反举给曼库，曼库跳起转身直线杀下，十一比七，两方比分逐渐接近。北京队也用拉开杀球和灵活补位防御对方软杀。经过几度争夺，北京队终于争回发球权。张然发球又急又硬，曼库低手接回，正落北京队网前，叶灼直线劈下，接着伍理民又扣下一个落点极好的硬球；北京队趁势猛击，先以十五比八获胜第一局。
    第二局开赛后，球场上的景况更加紧张。曼库在网边连杀三个斜线硬球都被北京队江振洪卧地救起。看台观众对印度队的扣杀本领和北京队的敏捷救球报以热烈的掌声。但印度队占着优势。北京队的进攻方法开始多样化，先是张然、伍理民和李策大组织一次快板球争回发球权，却又被古普塔杀球夺回。印度队并趁前排攻击力量强大的时候，连续发动猛烈进攻，场上纪录七比二，北京队仍处劣势。随后北京队再度组织梯次进攻战，张然又吊球得分，纪录是八比八，两队第一次拉成平手。以后两方每长一分都耗费了相当大的力量，印度队却保持领先状态。北京队进攻战术运用得比较灵活、巧妙，一连长了四分，结果以十五比十再胜一局。
    第三局印度队以拉志和萨加尔替换哈利德和阿鲁纳查兰，北京队仍以原有队员应战。印度队换人后，进攻较前稳重。萨加尔举球高低适度。曼库在网边显得分外活跃，每逢这个敏捷过人的印度国家排球选手吊球或杀球过网时，观众都报以热烈的掌声。北京队运用快板进攻和梯次战术打了不少好球。最后以十五比十胜第三局。
    印度国家排球队虽然在初赛中遭受挫败，但显示出了他们是一个具有优良技术的球队，无论扣杀，拦网，都有相当大的把握。由于队员不习惯我国北方气候，技术的发挥显然受了一些影响，但他们始终奋战不息的精神，给人们留下了很深的印象。（附图片）
