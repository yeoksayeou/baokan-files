    New Open Source Power Plant Begins Installing Machinery
    The construction of the main building of the new Open Source Power Plant, the second automated thermal power plant built in the Southwest region, is nearing completion. Major workshops are installing machinery while construction is underway. A dedicated railway line has been built to the power plant, and many machines have been transported to the construction site by rail.
    From design to construction, the Open Source Power Plant is being built with the assistance of Soviet experts. Blueprints were sent from Moscow, and the latest machinery and equipment were sent from Soviet factories. Soviet experts are deeply involved in guiding the work on the construction site every day. In the third quarter, due to the implementation of 199 suggestions from Soviet experts, the progress of various projects has accelerated. Currently, the reinforced concrete work of the main building has been completed more than 85%.
    The people building the Open Source Power Plant come from all over the country. Demobilized soldiers have also come to this construction site, and they are working diligently day and night. At night, the light from arc lamps and electric lights illuminates the construction site as if it were daytime, and the workers are striving to complete the construction of this power plant as soon as possible.

    新建开源电站开始安装机器
    西南地区新建的第二座自动化火力发电站——开源发电站的主厂房的建筑工程已快完工，各主要车间都在进行建筑的同时开始安装机器。一条专用铁路线已修筑到电站，许多机器从铁路运到了工地。
    开源电站从设计到施工，都是在苏联专家的帮助下进行的。从莫斯科送来了图纸，从苏联工厂送来了最新式的机器设备。苏联专家每日深入工地指导工作。第三季度由于执行了苏联专家的一百九十九条建议，各项工程进展加快。现在，主厂房的钢筋混凝土工程已完成百分之八十五以上。
    建设开源电站的人们来自祖国各地，复员军人们也来到这个工地，他们日夜辛勤地劳动着。晚上，弧光灯和电灯的光芒把工地照耀得像白昼一样，工人们正争取早日把这座发电站修建完成。
