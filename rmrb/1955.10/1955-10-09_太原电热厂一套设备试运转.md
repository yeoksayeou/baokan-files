    A set of highly mechanized power generating equipment at the Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant has undergone trial operation. The installation workers are striving to generate electricity ahead of schedule.

    After this set of power generating equipment is put into production, its power generation capacity will be equal to the original power capacity of Taiyuan City. Adding the equipment that has already been put into production last year and this year, the power generation capacity of the Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant has more than doubled the original power capacity of Taiyuan City, and electricity users in Yuci and Yangquan will receive more sufficient power.

    The installation of this set of power generating equipment started in April. With the help of Soviet experts, the installation progress was very fast. The first safe operation was carried out from September 18th to 21st, and the quality of the project fully met the design standards. More than 78,000 yuan was saved during the installation process, completing the cost reduction plan. (Wu Yafeng, Yuan Kuanfu)

    太原电热厂一套设备试运转
    太原电热厂又有一套高度机械化的发电设备进行了试运转。安装工人们正在争取提前发电。
    这一套发电设备投入生产以后，发电能力将等于太原市原有的电力；再加上去年和今年已经投入生产的设备，太原电热厂的发电能力已经超过太原市原有电力的一倍，远在榆次、阳泉的用电户，都会得到更加充足的电力。
    这一套发电设备从四月份开始安装，在苏联专家的帮助下，安装工程进度很快。九月十八日到二十一日进行了第一次安全运转，工程质量完全合乎设计标准。安装过程中还节约了七万八千多元，完成了降低成本的计划。　（吴亚峰　员宽甫）
