Comprehensive Planning in Xiqin Village, Shuangcheng County

Xiqin Village in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province, created advanced experience in the comprehensive planning of the cooperative movement in the summer of 1954, promptly solving a series of problems that arose during the transition of agricultural production cooperatives from the trial stage to a high tide of great development. Now, Xiqin Village has basically achieved cooperativization.

Due to the implementation of unified management, improved farming techniques, the use of new agricultural implements, increased fertilizer application, and the expansion of the planting area of high-yield crops by all agricultural cooperatives in the village this year, the village harvested more than 654,000 jin of grain than last year.

The Xiqin Village Branch of the Communist Party of China often helps nascent cooperatives solve problems in running and producing through mutual aid and cooperation networks. This is the accountants of two old cooperatives and six nascent cooperatives studying the autumn harvest distribution problem through the "accountant mutual aid and cooperation network."

Due to the realization of cooperative management, the labor efficiency of farmers has been greatly improved, which makes it possible to reclaim ten hectares of wasteland this year. This is the members of the First Agricultural Cooperative using new animal-powered farm implements to reclaim wasteland.

During the autumn harvest, some individual farmers voluntarily signed up to join the cooperative. These are individual farmers who want to join the cooperative visiting the fields of the agricultural cooperative. Yu Wenhua (first person on the left), the secretary of the Xiqin Village Branch of the Communist Party of China, is introducing them to the good crops of the agricultural cooperative.

    全面规划后的双城县希勤村
    黑龙江省双城县希勤村，一九五四年夏季创造了合作化运动全面规划的先进经验，及时地解决了农业生产合作社由试办阶段进入大发展高潮时期所产生的一系列问题。现在，希勤村已经基本上实现了合作化。
    今年全村各农业合作社由于实行了统一经营，改进了耕作技术，使用了新式农具，增施了肥料，扩大了高产作物种植面积，全村比去年多收了六十五万四千多斤粮食。新华社记者　胡伟摄

    今天的希勤村
    中共希勤村支部经常通过互助合作网帮助雏型社解决办社和生产中的问题。这是两个老社的会计和六个雏型社的会计通过“会计互助合作网”研究秋收分配问题。
    由于实现了合作经营，农民的劳动效率大大提高，这就有可能在今年开垦十垧荒地。这是第一农业合作社的社员用新式畜力农具在开荒。
    秋收期间，有些个体农民自愿报名入社。这是要求入社的个体农民到农业合作社的田间参观，中共希勤村支部书记于文化（左第一人）给他们介绍农业合作社的好庄稼。
