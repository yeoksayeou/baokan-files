　　In recent years, Indian friends have been constantly visiting our country; we Chinese people also often go to India for friendly visits. They both bring back cordial and unforgettable impressions. Indeed, the people of China and India, with a tradition of friendship spanning over two thousand years, have become even more deeply affectionate in recent years.
　　When I met Mr. Das Gupta, the head of the Indian legal workers delegation to China, his first words were: "The scenery of China is so beautiful, the capital of Beijing is so magnificent, your people and your country have left us with warm and happy memories."
　　Mr. Das Gupta and his delegation have been in China for half a month. They very happily celebrated our National Day with the people of Beijing. Late at night on October 1st, some of their friends even went to Tiananmen Square and joined the festive singing and dancing of the young men and women of Beijing.
　　Mr. Das Gupta and his delegation visited our factories and farms, and toured our places of interest and historical sites. Because they are all famous legal workers of the Republic of India, and Mr. Das Gupta himself is the Vice-Chairman of the All-India Democratic Lawyers Association, they are particularly interested in China's judicial system and judicial work.
　　Mr. Das Gupta believes that strengthening the ties between legal workers of the two countries will help further develop the cause of Sino-Indian friendship. He said: "Judicial workers are the guardians of the law of a country. Strengthening contacts, frequent exchanges, frequent exchanges of views, and frequent discussions of the progress of the two countries and their development along the right path between us, then, of course, we can deepen mutual understanding between the two countries and enhance the friendship between the two countries."
　　Mr. Das Gupta talked about his delegation's impressions of China's judicial system. He said: "Our impression is not only very good, but also very profound. We are very happy to have the opportunity to discuss some interesting issues in the legislative and judicial fields with your judicial workers."
　　"Friends in the Chinese judicial circles," Mr. Das Gupta continued, "often ask us to offer some criticisms of China's judicial work. But at least for now, we cannot offer such opinions. Because we are here mainly to learn, and we have indeed learned a lot. When we have digested what we have learned in China, perhaps in the future, we may offer some opinions like one brother treats another."
　　Our Indian friends once went to an intermediate court in Beijing to observe the trial of a couple seeking a divorce due to incompatibility. Mr. Das Gupta said: "The handling of the entire case left me with a very deep impression. In the process of handling the case, I saw that the judge had sympathy for both parties and tried his best to reconcile them. The judge truly considered the interests of both parties, considered the views of both parties, and then came to a fair conclusion. I feel that the handling of the case was not complicated and was so straightforward, but it was handled correctly and satisfied the wishes of both parties." Mr. Das Gupta praised and said: "Such a court makes it easy for the people to approach, and everyone can come to such a court to get justice."
　　Our Indian friends also visited a prison in Beijing. Mr. Das Gupta was very interested in the Chinese judicial system's policy of educating and reforming prisoners. He said: "I saw everything in the prison. What impressed me the most was the spirit of the Chinese government in dealing with criminals. Most importantly, the Chinese government believes that criminals are also human beings. Therefore, even in prison, criminals are also treated as human beings. They are given various conveniences such as life, entertainment, etc. At the same time, I also saw the prisoners working. I really felt that they were not only working voluntarily, but also happily. I really believe that these prisoners will be reformed through labor. If that is the case, it will be a great achievement."
　　The topic turned to the delegation's impressions of their visit to China. Mr. Das Gupta said:
　　"We saw some construction projects in China, and we gained a deep impression of your country's achievements in construction. We visited a collective farm in the Northeast. We saw the farm members treating their work with enthusiasm. This shows that everything is going in the right direction. 'Cooperativization' is one of the great tasks that your country is undertaking.
　　"At the same time, we have also noticed that the Chinese people not only have a love for their own country, but also have a high degree of organization and discipline. This is a very precious spirit. The Chinese people have a great ideal and enthusiasm for building their own country. I think all of this has made the new China a great country in the short few years since liberation. My delegation and I are convinced that the new China will rise and prosper day by day. Your country will be full of great events, and this country will be a great hope for the world.
　　"Finally, I would also like to talk about the lofty friendship between the people of China and India. In India, I know deeply the love and deep friendship of the Indian people for the Chinese people; now that I have come to China, I feel the love and deep friendship of the Chinese people for the Indian people. This makes me full of hope and optimism for the future. China and India have both suffered the fate of colonial oppression. Now that India has gained independence and China has been liberated, the people of our two countries should naturally be closely related and as close as brothers. Moreover, both of our countries inherit the traditions of ancient cultures. We are both Eastern countries, and we have many, many things in common. In short, the continuous development and strengthening of the friendly relations between the two great countries of Asia—China and India—will be able to make a major contribution to world peace."
　　At the end of our conversation, Mr. Das Gupta specially emphasized to me: "As a concluding remark, I want to say one more sentence: Long live the friendship between the people of China and India!"

    访达斯古普塔先生
    本报记者
    这几年，不断有印度朋友到我们的国家来作客；我们中国人也常常到印度去进行友好访问。他们彼此都带回了亲切的、难忘的印象。的确，有着两千多年友谊传统的中印两国人民，近几年来是更加情谊深笃了。
    当我见到印度法律工作者访华代表团团长达斯古普塔先生时，他的第一句话就是：“中国的景物是太美丽了，北京的都城是太锦绣了，你们的人民，你们的国度都给我们留下了温暖、幸福的记忆。”
    达斯古普塔先生和他的代表团在中国已经有半个月了。他们非常愉快地和北京市民一道欢度了我国的国庆。十月一日深夜，他们中间有些朋友还到天安门前，加入了北京的青年男女们的节日歌舞。
    达斯古普塔先生和他的代表团参观了我国的工厂和农庄，游览了我国的名胜和古迹。因为他们都是印度共和国的著名的法律工作者，达斯古普塔先生本人又是全印民主法律工作者协会的副主席，所以他们对于中国的司法制度及司法工作感到特别的兴趣。
    达斯古普塔先生认为，两国法律工作者的加强联系会有助于中印友好事业的进一步的发展。他说：“司法工作者是一个国家法律的维护者。在我们之间加强联系，经常接触交往，经常交换意见，经常讨论两个国家的进步和沿着正确道路的发展，那末，我们当然能够加深两国之间的相互了解和增进两国的友谊。”
    达斯古普塔先生谈到了他的代表团对中国司法制度的印象。他说：“我们的印象不仅很好，而且非常深刻。我们非常高兴地获有机会和你们的司法工作者座谈关于立法和司法领域内的一些有兴趣的问题。”
    “中国司法界的朋友”，达斯古普塔先生接着说，“常常要我们对中国的司法工作提些批评意见。但是至少在目前，我们还不能够提出这样的意见。因为我们到这里主要是学习来的，我们的确学习了很多。等到我们消化了我们在中国所学习了的东西，将来也许，我们可能像一个兄弟对待另一个兄弟那样地提出一些意见来。”
    我们的印度朋友们曾经到北京市的一个中级法庭，去旁听了一对夫妇因感情不和而要求离婚的案件的审判。达斯古普塔先生说：“整个案件的处理使我获得了极深的印象。在案件的处理过程中我看到法官对双方都抱有同情心，并竭力希望他们和解。法官确实是从双方的利益着眼，考虑了双方的观点，然后得出了公正的结论。我觉得案件的处理方式并不复杂而且是那样的直截了当，但是却使案件得到了正确的处理，并且满足了双方的意愿。”达斯古普塔先生称赞地说：“这样的法庭使得人民易于接近，人人都能到这样的法庭上来得到正义的申诉。”
    我们的印度朋友也参观了北京市的一个监狱。达斯古普塔先生对于我国司法制度中对犯人采取教育改造的方针感到很大的兴趣。他说：“在监狱里，我看到了一切。给我印象最深的，就是中国政府对于处理罪犯的精神。最重要的，中国政府认为罪犯同样是人，因此，即使在监狱里，罪犯也同样得到作为一个人的待遇，他们获得生活，文娱活动等等的各种便利条件。同时，我也看到犯人们在进行着劳动。我的确感到，他们不仅是自愿地劳动着，而且是高兴地劳动着，我也的确相信，这些犯人会通过劳动得到改造。如果是那样，那就会是一件伟大的成就。”
    话题转到了代表团的访华观感。达斯古普塔先生说：
    “我们在中国看到了一些建设工程，我们获得了对你们国家建设上的成就的深刻印象。我们在东北访问了一个集体农庄。我们见到农庄庄员们热情地对待着他们的工作。这就表明，一切事物都按照正确的方向进行着。‘合作化’，这是你们国家正在进行着的伟大工作之一。
    “同时，我们也注意到了，中国人民不仅有着对于自己祖国的热爱，而且有着高度的组织性和纪律性。这是非常宝贵的精神。中国人民怀着建设自己祖国的伟大的理想和热情。我想，这一切使得新中国在解放后的短短几年内就变成了一个伟大的国家。我和我的代表团都深信，新中国将日益上升和日益繁荣。你们的国家将会充满着伟大的事件，这个国家将是世界上的一个伟大的希望。
    “最后，我还要谈到中印两国人民之间的崇高的友情。在印度，我深知印度人民对于中国人民的热爱和深厚的友情；现在到了中国，我感到了中国人民对印度人民的热爱和深厚的友情。这就使我对于未来满怀着希望和乐观。中印两国都遭受殖民主义压迫的命运，现在印度已获得了独立，中国已获得了解放，我们两国的人民自然应该是休戚相关，情同手足的。而且我们两国都继承着古老文化的传统，我们都是东方的国家，我们之间有着许多许多的共同点。总之，亚洲两个伟大的国家——中国和印度之间的友好关系的不断发展和加强，将能对世界和平作出重大的贡献。”
    在结束我们的谈话时，达斯古普塔先生特别着重地向我说：“作为结束语，我要再说一句：中印两国人民的友谊万岁！”
