    Prepare for Winter Construction of Building Installation Projects Early
    Du Enxun, Deputy Director of the Production Bureau of the Ministry of Construction
    Winter construction of building installation projects is an important method for the construction industry to gradually break away from the constraints of natural conditions, overcome the seasonality of construction, and strive for year-round balanced operations. Doing this work well is of great significance for ensuring the nation's construction speed and overcoming waste in basic construction. Now, in the vast areas north of the Yangtze River, winter will arrive in about a month. To ensure that winter construction can proceed smoothly and achieve the expected results, actively preparing for winter construction is an urgent and important task at present.
    In the first half of this year, enterprises affiliated with the Ministry of Construction only completed 76.8 percent of the planned target, accounting for about 30 percent of the annual planned workload. Although the situation gradually improved after July, by the end of September, it was only possible to complete about 72 percent of the annual plan. The remaining approximately 28 percent of the task must be completed in the fourth quarter. For enterprises undertaking key construction tasks, the workload in the fourth quarter is very heavy due to the late start of construction of many important factory buildings and pre-factory area projects this year, as well as the addition of some construction projects this year with money saved by the state. For example, several important factory building projects undertaken by a certain construction bureau only started construction in September, and about 45 percent of the tasks must be completed from September to December. The planned workload in November accounts for about 17 percent of the annual plan, which is 69 percent more than the task in the peak month of the normal construction season. At the same time, in order to create conditions for next year's construction, some projects originally scheduled for construction next year will also be started early this year. Most of these projects are distributed in North China, Northwest China, and Northeast China, and the effective construction period before winter freeze is at most about forty days from now. Based on the above situation, if winter construction is not implemented, it will be impossible to complete the construction plan. At the same time, there may be a serious rush to work before the freeze, causing huge waste of manpower and materials to the state. In the next two years, the state's basic construction workload will account for 48 percent of the entire five-year basic construction workload. Starting in 1956, some large-scale and technically complex projects will be fully launched. If we fail to complete this year's plan, it will increase the workload for next year and the year after, thereby increasing the difficulty of implementing the Five-Year Plan. In order to strive to complete more work this year, reduce the phenomenon of rushing to work before winter and the phenomenon of idleness and inactivity in winter, and avoid possible waste and losses, so as to ensure the comprehensive completion and over-fulfillment of this year's basic construction tasks and welcome the more arduous tasks next year, it is necessary to take active measures to carry out winter construction.
    Several years of winter construction experience have proven that the key to successful winter construction lies in making good preparations for winter construction. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant construction site, when carrying out winter construction last year, was able to complete the workload from November 1954 to February 1955 equivalent to 23.95 percent of the annual planned workload in 1954, exceeding the winter construction plan by 69 percent, because it prepared a series of preparations such as preparing winter construction plans and construction organization designs, formulating operating procedures, preparing equipment and training cadres at an early stage. In terms of quality, the design requirements were also met, and no quality accidents occurred in major structural projects. A total of more than 1.6 million workdays were invested in winter construction. If the average winter idle wage is calculated at 1.4 yuan per day, more than 2.2 million yuan can be saved. However, there are also many units that do not pay attention to the preparation of winter construction. Some units, seeing that winter is approaching, only focus on rushing to work and do not prepare for winter construction. When heavy snow or cold currents suddenly come, they do not have time to prepare various construction insulation facilities and material preparations, and as a result, they have to stop work. Some units have determined winter construction projects and made winter construction plans, but they have not carefully checked the winter construction conditions. As a result, they have included many projects that do not meet the winter construction conditions in the plan, and prepared a large amount of materials and equipment. Because there are no drawings, construction cannot be carried out, resulting in the backlog of raw materials. Some units rush to complete a large number of indoor projects before winter, leaving projects that are not suitable for winter construction to winter construction. The phenomenon of ignoring savings when formulating various technical measures and selecting construction methods is even more serious. Some projects could have been constructed using the freezing method or the heat storage method, but instead, they used the more expensive slow freezing method or steam heating method. Some small projects even used several construction methods. In preparing materials, mechanical equipment, and building temporary facilities, they do not follow the plan and construction organization design and construction budget, and use them widely, greatly increasing the cost of winter construction. According to statistics from four construction sites, including the Northwest Metal Structure Factory and the Central Gymnasium of North China First Company, the additional cost of winter construction accounted for as much as 32 percent of the cost required for the entire winter workload, and the lowest was also 12 percent. Many also neglect safety work in preparing for winter construction. According to statistics from only four units, including the North China, Northeast, and Northwest Engineering Bureaus and the directly affiliated companies of the Ministry, 815 large and small work-related injuries occurred in the two months of November and December last year. Due to the lack of fire-fighting equipment, incorrect technical measures, and technical personnel's irresponsibility in temperature measurement, a fire broke out in the training hall project of the Central Gymnasium construction site of North China First Company, causing a loss of 235,000 yuan and forcing it to stop work for seven days. The Northwest Metal Structure Factory construction site caught fire five times in a row, causing a loss of 15,000 yuan. There are also many units that have not trained temperature measurement personnel in advance, have not made thorough preparations for various insulation technical measures, and have not formulated systems and methods for controlling temperature, resulting in many quality accidents. These shortcomings should be avoided in this year's winter construction.
    This year, most of the winter construction projects are industrial factory buildings, which are technically complex and have strict quality requirements. Any negligence will have serious consequences. Therefore, we must make full preparations. Many units have already arranged preparations for winter construction and are gradually going deep into the site, which is good. However, some units have not yet put this work on the work agenda. Some units are paralyzed and complacent, thinking that "the workload of winter construction this year is not large" and "the technology is not more complicated than in the past," and they are slow to prepare; or a few people in the functional departments are preparing plans and formulating measures, and the site preparation work has not yet begun. Some units emphasize that the task before the freeze is tight and cannot spare the strength, and they shout empty slogans that preparation is important, but no one is actually responsible. These will seriously affect the smooth progress of winter construction and must be improved immediately.
    The main link in the preparation for winter construction is to make a good winter construction plan. When preparing the plan, on the one hand, make full use of the technical and economic possibilities to ensure the overall progress of the plant construction; on the other hand, realistically study and analyze the construction conditions and repeatedly balance the design, equipment, and technical strength. When arranging the construction progress, try to complete all projects that are not suitable for winter construction and permanent projects that can be used for winter construction (such as heating and power pipelines, electrical equipment, roads, fire-fighting water sources and equipment, etc.) before winter. At the same time, we must create the necessary conditions for next year's construction.
    Carefully preparing and implementing the construction organization design and doing a good job in various technical preparations and site layout are also important links in the preparation for winter construction. Construction units must prepare construction organization designs according to the characteristics of winter construction, make good heating and insulation measures, correctly select construction methods, properly arrange site working conditions and employees' living conditions, strengthen the supply of equipment and materials, do a good job in safety technology, labor protection, and fire-fighting measures, and prepare technical operating procedures.
    In order to practice thrift and reduce costs, all temporary facilities, equipment and materials, labor protection supplies, etc. required for winter construction must be based on the winter construction plan and construction organization design, prepare a winter construction budget, pay attention to using existing equipment, rationally use insulation materials and heating equipment, and try to concentrate heating to reduce material and heat consumption. What is especially important is that we must vigorously exert the effect of mechanization and factoryization. At the same time, we must strengthen the education of employees in cherishing state property and fight against all phenomena that ignore thrift.
    At present, our country's winter construction strength is very weak, and the number of personnel who can master winter construction technology is far from meeting the needs. Therefore, doing a good job in training has become an important condition to ensure the smooth progress of winter construction. Last year, the achievements of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant construction site in winter construction were relatively significant, which was closely related to the emphasis on employee training. Therefore, we should promote the existing winter construction experience and improve the technical level of winter construction personnel through summary and exchange experience meetings, technical report meetings, symposiums, short-term training courses, and spare-time night schools, so as to better complete the winter construction tasks.
    All units that undertake winter construction tasks must strengthen the leadership of the preparation for winter construction while carrying out the current tense construction. Before entering winter construction, we must also mobilize employees, especially functional departments, to thoroughly check the preparation for winter construction. Through inspection, we can grasp the situation in a timely manner, discover problems, and improve them in time.
    Winter construction of building installation projects is a very arduous and complex task. Only by doing all the preparatory work can we overcome the severe cold and achieve the expected results. All employees participating in winter construction should strive to create, painstakingly study the existing winter construction experience, learn the methods of winter construction, and strive to comprehensively complete the 1955 building installation tasks, welcome the more arduous construction tasks next year, and promote winter construction on a larger scale in the future, and accelerate the pace of national socialist industrialization.

    及早做好建筑安装工程的冬季施工准备
    建筑工程部生产局副局长  杜恩训
    建筑安装工程的冬季施工，是建筑工业逐步摆脱自然条件束缚，克服施工季节性，争取全年均衡作业的一个重要方法。做好这项工作，对于保证国家的建设速度，克服基本建设中的浪费，有很大意义。现在，长江以北广大地区，再有一个月左右就进入冬季了，为使冬季施工能顺利进行并收到预期效果，积极做好冬季施工准备工作是目前迫不容缓的重要任务。
    建筑工程部所属企业，今年上半年只完成预定计划的百分之七十六点八，约占全年计划工作量的百分之三十。七月以后，情况虽然逐步好转，但是到九月底，也只能完成全年计划约百分之七十二。其余约百分之二十八的任务须在第四季度中完成。担负重点建设任务的企业单位，由于许多重要厂房工程和厂前区工程今年开工晚，以及今年国家用节约下来的钱增加了一些工程项目，所以第四季度的工作量非常重。如某工程局负责施工的几个重要厂房工程，九月份才陆续开工，约有百分之四十五的任务须在九月至十二月完成，其中十一月份计划工作量约占年计划的百分之十七，较正常施工季节的最高月份的任务还多百分之六十九。同时为了给明年施工创造条件，有些原定在明年施工的工程也将提前在今年施工，这些工程大多分布在华北、西北、东北等地区，而这些地区从现在算起，冬前有效施工期最多不过四十天左右。根据上述情况，如果不实行冬季施工，就不可能完成施工计划，同时还可能在封冻前出现严重的突击抢工，给国家带来人力、物力的巨大浪费。今后两年，国家基本建设工作量占整个五年基本建设工作量的百分之四十八。从一九五六年起，一些规模巨大，技术复杂的工程将要全面开工。如果我们今年计划完不成，就会增加明年和后年的工作量，从而给执行五年计划增加困难。为了争取今年完成更多的工作量，减少冬季来临之前突击赶工和冬季窝工、闲工现象，避免可能引起的浪费损失，以保证今年基本建设任务全面完成并争取超额完成，迎接明年更加繁重的任务，都必须采取积极措施，进行冬季施工。
    几年来冬季施工经验证明，顺利进行冬季施工的关键，在于做好冬季施工准备工作。第一汽车制造厂工地，去年冬季施工的时候，就是由于较早地进行编制冬季施工计划和施工组织设计，制定操作规程，准备器材设备和训练干部等一系列的准备工作，从一九五四年十一月到一九五五年二月所完成的工作量，相当于一九五四年全年计划工作量的百分之二十三点九五，超额百分之六十九完成冬季施工计划。在质量方面也达到了设计要求，主要结构工程都没有发生质量事故，投入冬季施工的工作日计一百六十多万日，如每工冬闲工资平均以一元四角计算，可节约二百二十多万元。但是，也有很多单位不重视冬季施工准备工作。有的单位眼看就要进入冬季，仍然只顾赶工，不做冬季施工准备，大雪或寒流突然来临时，各项施工保温设施、材料准备等工作都来不及准备，结果不得不停工。有的单位确定了冬季施工项目，作了冬季施工计划，但是没有认真检查冬季施工条件，结果把许多不具备冬季施工条件的工程也列入计划，准备了大量材料、设备，因为没有图纸不能施工，造成原材料的积压。还有的单位在冬季来临以前，把大量室内工程抢完，而把不宜冬季施工的工程留在冬季施工。在制定各项技术措施和选择施工方法时忽视节约的现象更为严重。有些工程本来可以采用冻结法或蓄热法施工，却采用成本较高的缓遭冻结法或蒸气加热法，一些小工程，甚至采用几套施工方法。在准备材料、机械设备，修建暂设工程方面，更不按计划和施工组织设计及施工预算进行，宽打宽用，使冬季施工的造价大大增高。据西北金属结构厂、华北第一公司中央体育馆等四个工地统计，冬季施工增加的费用最高的竟占整个冬季工作量所需费用的百分之三十二，最低的也达百分之十二。在冬季施工准备工作中，忽视保安工作的也很多。仅据华北、东北、西北等工程局和部直属公司四个单位的统计，在去年十一、十二两个月中，就发生大小工伤事故八百一十五次。华北第一公司中央体育馆工地，由于缺乏消防设备，技术措施错误和技术人员对测温处理不负责任，练习馆工程发生火灾，造成二十三万五千元的损失，并被迫停工七天。西北金属结构厂工地连续五次失火，损失一万五千元。也有不少单位事先没有训练测温人员，没有周密地做好各项保温技术措施，没有制定控制温度的制度和办法等等，以致造成不少质量事故。这些缺点，在今年冬季施工时应避免发生。
    今年冬季施工的工程大都是工业厂房，技术复杂，质量要求严格，任何疏忽大意都会造成严重后果，因此必须充分做好准备工作。目前已有不少单位布置了冬季施工准备工作，并已逐渐深入到现场，这是好的。但也有些单位还没有把这项工作摆到工作日程上来。其中有的单位麻痹大意，骄傲自满，认为“今年冬季施工工作量不大”，“技术上并不比过去复杂”，迟迟不做准备工作；或者职能机构少数人员编计划、制定措施，工地的准备工作还没有开始。有的单位强调封冻前任务紧张，抽不出力量，空喊准备重要，实际无人负责。这些都会严重影响冬季施工的顺利进行，必须立即改进。
    冬季施工准备的主要环节是做好冬季施工计划。在编制计划时，一方面充分利用在技术上和经济上的可能性，以便保证建厂的总进度；另一方面也应实事求是地研究分析施工条件，反复进行设计、设备、技术力量的平衡。在安排施工进度时，要把一切不宜在冬季施工的工程和可供冬季施工利用的永久工程（如热力和动力管道、电气设备、道路、消防水源及设备等），尽量争取在冬季以前完成。同时要为明年施工创造必要的条件。
    认真编制和执行施工组织设计，做好各项技术准备和现场布置工作，也是冬季施工准备工作的重要环节。施工单位必须根据冬季施工特点编制施工组织设计，做好各项加热保温措施，正确选择施工方法，妥贴安排现场工作条件和职工的生活条件，加强器材设备供应工作，做好安全技术劳动保护和消防措施，编制技术操作规程。
    为了厉行节约、降低成本，冬季施工所需要的一切临时设施和设备器材、劳动保护用品等，必须根据冬季施工计划和施工组织设计，编制冬季施工预算，注意利用现有设备，合理使用保温材料和取暖设备，尽量集中供热，以减少材料和热量消耗。尤其重要的是必须大力发挥机械化和工厂化的效果。同时要加强对职工进行爱护国家财产的教育，向一切忽视节约的现象进行斗争。
    目前我国冬季施工力量非常薄弱，能够掌握冬季施工技术的人员，远远不能满足需要。所以，做好培养训练工作就成为保证冬季施工顺利进行的重要条件。去年，第一汽车制造厂工地冬季施工的成绩所以比较显著，跟重视职工的培养训练有密切关系。因此，应通过总结和交流经验会、技术报告会、座谈会、短期训练班、业余夜校等形式，推广已有的冬季施工经验，提高冬季施工人员的技术水平，以更好地完成冬季施工任务。
    凡担负有冬季施工任务的单位，必须在当前紧张施工的同时，加强冬季施工准备工作的领导。在进入冬季施工以前还要发动职工，特别是职能部门，彻底检查一次冬季施工准备工作，通过检查，及时掌握情况，发现问题，及时改进。
    建筑安装工程冬季施工是一件非常艰巨复杂的工作，只有做好一切准备工作，才能战胜严寒，取得预期的效果。参加冬季施工的全体职工，应以创造的精神，刻苦钻研已有的冬季施工经验，学会冬季施工的方法，为全面地完成一九五五年建筑安装任务，为迎接明年更加繁重的建设任务，为今后更大规模地推行冬季施工，加速国家社会主义工业化的建设速度而努力。
