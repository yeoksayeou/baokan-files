    (I) In Order to Promote the Normalization of Japan-Korea Relations
    Kim Ung-gi, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Sadao Furuya, head of the Japanese Diet delegation, issued a joint communiqué announcing that the two sides had reached an agreement on five issues, affirming that both Korea and Japan should make active efforts to achieve the normalization of diplomatic relations. At the same time, the negotiations between the Korean International Trade Promotion Committee and the Japan-Soviet Trade Association on promoting trade between Korea and Japan have also reached a comprehensive agreement. These agreements between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and relevant parties in Japan are an important contribution to improving relations between Korea and Japan and easing the situation in the Far East. It is entirely beneficial to the people of both Korea and Japan.
    The joint communiqué issued in Pyongyang vividly illustrates that the role of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the cause of international peace is growing. The emergence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has opened a new page in the history of the Korean people and is also an important event in the post-war Asian situation. After the United States launched a war of aggression, the Korean people underwent the most severe test, defended their motherland with unparalleled courage, and made a huge contribution to maintaining peace in the Far East. After the end of the war, the Korean people have made brilliant achievements in restoring and developing the national economy, and its industrial output has exceeded the pre-war level. These facts tell people most clearly that it is simply impossible to ignore the existence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    The joint communiqué issued in Pyongyang reflects the common desire of the Korean and Japanese people to improve relations between the two countries. As an Asian country, Japan should never have no contact with its neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Refusing to establish such contact will make it impossible to solve common problems between the two countries, such as trade, expatriates, and fishermen. This is of course detrimental to the Japanese people. Ten years have passed since the end of the anti-fascist war, but diplomatic relations between Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have not yet been established, and trade relations between them are subject to artificial restrictions. Moreover, those in the Japanese ruling group who follow the United States are still unwilling to normalize diplomatic relations between Korea and Japan, and they are not interested in developing trade between the two countries and solving specific problems between them. This approach, of course, does nothing to alleviate Japan's isolated position in Asia.
    From the joint communiqué issued in Pyongyang, it can be seen that the Japanese public is not satisfied with this situation. Like the Korean people, the Japanese public urgently hopes to establish diplomatic relations between Japan and Korea as soon as possible and develop mutual economic and cultural ties. The joint efforts made by the Japanese public and the Korean people to realize this wish will be actively supported by the Chinese people, because every progress made in this regard will help ease the international situation, especially the tense situation in the Far East.

    （一）为了促进朝日关系的正常化
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会副委员长金应基和日本国会议员代表团团长古屋贞雄发表联合公报，宣布双方就五项问题达成了协议，肯定朝鲜和日本两国应当为实现外交关系的正常化作积极的努力。同时，朝鲜国际贸易促进委员会和日苏贸易协会关于促进朝鲜和日本的贸易的谈判也已经达成了全面的协议。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和日本有关方面的这些协议，对于改善朝鲜和日本两国的关系，对于和缓远东局势是重要的贡献。它对于朝鲜和日本两国人民是完全有利的。
    平壤发表的联合公报生动地说明：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在国际和平事业中的作用正在日益增长。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的出现，为朝鲜人民的历史展开了崭新的一页，而且也是战后亚洲局势中的重要事件。在美国发动了侵略战争以后，朝鲜人民经历了最严重的考验，以无比的英勇捍卫了自己的祖国，并为维护远东和平作出了巨大的贡献。在战争结束以后，朝鲜人民在恢复和发展国民经济方面取得了辉煌的成就，它的工业产量已经超过了战前的水平。这些事实最清楚不过地告诉人们：企图无视朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的存在，那是根本不可能的。
    在平壤发表的联合公报，反映了朝鲜人民和日本人民要求改进两国关系的共同愿望。作为一个亚洲国家，日本决不应该同自己的邻国，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国不发生联系。拒绝建立这种联系，就要使两国之间的共同问题，例如贸易、侨民和渔民等等问题无法解决。这对于日本人民当然是不利的。反法西斯战争结束已经十年之久，日本同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之间的外交关系却至今没有建立，它们之间的贸易关系也受到人为的限制。而且日本统治集团中那些跟美国走的人直到现在还不愿使朝鲜和日本两国外交关系正常化，他们对发展两国贸易和解决两国之间的具体问题不感兴趣。这种做法当然无补于日本在亚洲的孤立地位。
    从平壤发表的联合公报可以看出，日本公众对于这种情况并不满意。日本公众和朝鲜人民一样，迫切希望早日建立日本同朝鲜的外交关系以及发展相互间的经济和文化联系。日本公众为实现这一愿望和朝鲜人民所作的共同努力，将得到中国人民的积极支持，因为在这一方面所取得的每一进展，都有助于和缓国际局势，特别是远东地区的紧张局势。
