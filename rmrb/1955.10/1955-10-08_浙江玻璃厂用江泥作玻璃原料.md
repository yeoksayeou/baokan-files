The workers of the Zhejiang Provincial Local State-Owned Zhejiang Glass Factory have successfully used the Qiantang River mud to replace quartz and yellow sand in trial production of bluish-white glass and dark-colored glass.

According to chemical analysis, this kind of river mud contains 82.43 percent silicon dioxide, 7.63 percent aluminum oxide, and components such as calcium, iron, and magnesium oxides. It can replace 70 to 75 percent of the quartz material in the manufacture of bluish-white glass or replace the yellow sand material in the manufacture of dark-colored glass. The bluish-white and dark-colored glassware manufactured using this river mud have been technically assessed and found to meet quality specifications in terms of heat resistance, lack of striations, absence of bubbles, gloss, and toughness. Because the particles of river mud are finer than those of quartz powder and yellow sand, the amount of soda ash flux can be reduced by 25 percent during the melting process, which reduces the cost of bluish-white glass raw materials by 2.2 percent and the cost of dark-colored glass raw materials by 5.7 percent. The factory is now conducting research on using river mud to trial-produce other colored daily-use glassware and white material glass.

    浙江玻璃厂用江泥作玻璃原料
    浙江省地方国营浙江玻璃厂工人利用钱塘江江泥代替石英和黄砂试制青白玻璃和深色玻璃成功。
    这种江泥据化验分析，含有百分之八十二点四三的氧化矽和百分之七点六三的氧化铝，以及钙、铁、镁氧化物等成分。它可以代替制造青白玻璃中百分之七十到七十五的石英用料，或代替制造深色玻璃中的黄砂用料。利用这种江泥制造青白和深色的玻璃器皿，经过技术鉴定，耐热、无纹、无气泡，光亮和韧度等都合乎质量规格。由于江泥比石英粉和黄砂的颗粒细小，在溶制过程中，助溶剂纯碱的用量可以减少百分之二十五，这就使青白玻璃原料的成本降低了百分之二点二，深色玻璃原料的成本降低了百分之五点七。现在这个工厂正在进行用江泥试制其它有色的日用玻璃器皿和白料玻璃的研究工作。
