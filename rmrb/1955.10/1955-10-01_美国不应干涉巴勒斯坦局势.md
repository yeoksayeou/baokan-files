    The United States Should Not Interfere in the Palestinian Situation

    At the United Nations General Assembly, the U.S. Secretary of State once again hawked his plan, announced on August 26th, to "resolve" the Palestinian issue, demanding that the United Nations "take action" according to the U.S. plan. This plan proposes using U.S. loans to solve the Arab refugee problem, concluding a "collective measures" treaty with U.S. participation to "guarantee security," and delineating permanent borders between Israel and Arab countries based on the 1949 armistice lines.

    According to Dulles, these U.S. suggestions appear to be mediating the Palestinian dispute in order to stabilize the situation in the Near and Middle East. However, anyone who understands the facts knows, how can the United States act as a "mediator" in the Palestinian dispute? It was none other than the United States that created and deepened the conflict between Israelis and Arabs after World War II.

    In 1945, just as the Palestinian people's call for an end to British rule was high, the United States rushed to announce a plan for 100,000 European Jews to immigrate to Palestine in order to take the opportunity to intervene. This action exacerbated the situation in Palestine and fueled the fierce struggle between American and British imperialism in Palestine. The United States used the old imperialist method of dealing with backward regions, instigating some people in Palestine against others. On the one hand, it used some Jews to establish their own economic and political power in Palestine, squeezing out Arabs; on the other hand, it courted both sides and provoked both sides. These actions by the United States made the dispute between Arabs and Israelis more complicated and acute. This led to the bloody war in Palestine in 1948 and created a long-term antagonistic situation between Israelis and Arabs.

    To this day, the United States has not abandoned its policy of provocation against Israel and Arab countries. In order to drag the Near and Middle Eastern countries into military blocs and expand U.S. power with Israel as a base, it has taken various steps to threaten and pressure Arab countries to submit to the United States. The Israeli weekly "Homepage" recently wrote that the United States is "turning Israel into a stick to use against Egypt." Even after Dulles's suggestion was published, the United States was still spreading hostile atmosphere and engaging in provocation between Israel and Arab countries. The International News Service declared: "War in the Near and Middle East may break out at any time." United Press International even openly predicted that after the war began, "the Arabs would fail" because Israel is "the second most powerful military power in the Middle East after Turkey." Obviously, these activities of the United States will only deepen the distrust and mutual suspicion between Israel and Arab countries, and deepen the unstable situation in the Near and Middle East. Dulles wants to portray himself as a "mediator" in the Palestinian dispute, something even he himself would not believe.

    In the context of the further easing of the international situation and the rising struggle of the peoples of the Near and Middle East for national independence, the U.S. policy of piecing together military blocs and carrying out colonial expansion in the Near and Middle East has become increasingly unpopular and has been continuously defeated. The broad masses of people in the Near and Middle East see that it is no coincidence that Dulles put forward his "peace" proposal at this time. American newspapers admit that the "prestige" of the United States in the Near and Middle East has fallen to a "new low." This makes it necessary for the United States to whitewash its colonialist policy in order to carry out new deceptions and interventions. However, although Dulles's suggestion is disguised, it cannot conceal its true intention. Palestine is so far away from the United States, why must its affairs be interfered with by the United States, and why must it be "guaranteed" by the United States to be resolved? Isn't this request a manifestation of the United States wanting to further intervene in Palestine?

    It must be pointed out that the United States is not genuinely trying to resolve the Palestinian dispute, but is only using it as a pretext to eliminate certain obstacles and drag more Near and Middle Eastern countries into military blocs. United Press International stated very clearly that Dulles's suggestion "is part of the West's plan to strengthen the defenses of the non-communist world." Washington officials also publicly stated on September 24 that they hoped that Israel and Arab countries would "both" "conclude a security agreement with the West (!)."

    The logic of facts tells us that the reason why the Palestinian dispute has not been resolved for a long time is not because the United States has intervened too little, but just the opposite, it is because the United States refuses to let go and refuses to stop its interference in Palestine. Now, Dulles's suggestion is still a continuation of past policies, and is a further development. This suggestion disregards the legitimate aspirations of the Arab people and runs counter to the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference. If we follow this suggestion, it will of course only create new disputes and make the Palestinian situation and the situation in the Near and Middle East more deteriorated and complicated. This is completely incompatible with the security interests of the Israeli people and the Arab countries, and it is also incompatible with the hopes of all peace-loving people.

    Israelis and Arabs have historically lived in peace for generations, and of course they can live in peace now. There is no irreconcilable conflict of interest between them. The current Palestinian dispute is the result of long-term imperialist provocation, and the tension in the Near and Middle East is caused by imperialist intervention policies. As long as there is no external interference, we believe that the parties concerned can fully conduct consultations on an equal basis and peacefully resolve the Palestinian issue. In peaceful consultations, the rights of the Arab people should be taken into account, and some existing unreasonable situations should be appropriately changed. Only in this way can it be in the fundamental interests of all countries in the Near and Middle East, and it is also in line with the hopes of all peace-loving people.

### 美国不应干涉巴勒斯坦局势

    美国不应干涉巴勒斯坦局势
    在联合国大会上，美国国务卿又来兜售他在八月二十六日宣布的“解决”巴勒斯坦问题的计划，要求联合国按照美国的方案“采取行动”。他这个计划建议利用美国的贷款来解决阿拉伯难民问题，订立一个由美国参加的“集体措施”条约来“保证安全”，并根据一九四九年停战线，来划定以色列和阿拉伯国家间的永久国界线。
    按照杜勒斯的说法，美国的这些建议仿佛是为了调停巴勒斯坦的纠纷问题，以稳定中近东的局势。但是，凡是了解事实真相的人都知道，在巴勒斯坦的纠纷问题上，怎么能谈得上由美国充当“调停人”呢？不是别人，恰恰就是美国，在第二次世界大战以后，制造了和加深了以色列人和阿拉伯人之间的冲突。
    一九四五年，正当巴勒斯坦人民要求结束英国统治的呼声高昂的时候，美国为了乘机插足巴勒斯坦，就匆匆忙忙地宣布了欧洲十万犹太人移居巴勒斯坦的计划。这个行动引起了巴勒斯坦局势的恶化，并推进了美英帝国主义之间在巴勒斯坦的剧烈斗争。美国使用帝国主义对付落后地区的老办法，在巴勒斯坦挑拨一部分人反对另一部分人。它一方面利用一部分犹太人在巴勒斯坦建立了自己的经济和政治势力，排挤阿拉伯人；另一方面又两面拉拢、两面挑拨。美国的这些做法，使阿拉伯人同以色列人之间的纠纷更加复杂更加尖锐化。这样就酿成了一九四八年的巴勒斯坦流血战争，并造成以色列人和阿拉伯人长期敌对的局面。
    直到今天，美国仍然没有放弃它对以色列和阿拉伯国家的挑拨政策。为了把中近东国家都拖进军事集团，并以以色列为基地扩张美国的势力，它曾经采取各种步骤来威胁和压迫阿拉伯国家向美国就范。以色列“首页”周刊最近写道，美国正“把以色列变成一根用来对付埃及的棍子”。就在杜勒斯的建议发表以后，美国也还在以色列和阿拉伯国家之间散布敌对空气，进行挑拨。国际新闻社宣称：“中近东战事可能随时爆发”。合众社更公然预料，战争开始后，“阿拉伯会失败的”，因为以色列是“中东的仅次于土耳其的第二位军事力量最强大的国家”。显然，美国这些活动只会加深以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的不信任和互相猜疑，加深中近东的不稳定局势。杜勒斯想把自己装成巴勒斯坦纠纷的“调停人”，那是连他自己也不会相信的。
    在国际局势进一步趋于缓和的情况下，在中近东各国人民争取民族独立的斗争正在高涨的情况下，美国在中近东拼凑军事集团和进行殖民扩张的政策，已经越来越不得人心，并不断遭到失败。中近东广大人民看到，杜勒斯在这时提出他的“和平”建议，并非偶然。美国报刊承认，美国在中近东的“声望”下降到了“新的低潮”。这就使得美国有必要粉刷它的殖民主义政策，来进行新的欺骗和干涉。但是，杜勒斯的建议虽然披上了伪装，却不能掩盖它的真正意图。巴勒斯坦和美国相距如此遥远，这里的事务为什么一定要由美国来干涉，一定要由美国“保证”才能解决呢？这种要求难道还不是美国想进一步插足巴勒斯坦的表现吗？
    必须指出，美国根本不是真心想解决巴勒斯坦纠纷，而只是以此为名，消除某些障碍，把更多的中近东国家拉入军事集团。合众社说得很明白，杜勒斯的建议“是西方加强非共产党世界防务计划的一部分”。华盛顿的官员也在九月二十四日公开表示，希望以色列和阿拉伯国家“双方”将“同西方一起（！）缔结安全协定”。
    事实的逻辑告诉我们，长期以来巴勒斯坦纠纷问题所以不能解决，不是因为美国插手太少了，刚好相反，就是因为美国不肯撒手，不肯停止它对巴勒斯坦的干涉。现在，杜勒斯的建议还是过去政策的继续，而且是更进一步的发展。这个建议无视阿拉伯人民的正当愿望，并且与亚非会议的决议背道而驰。如果按照这个建议做去，当然只会制造新的纠纷，使巴勒斯坦局势以及中近东局势更加恶化和复杂化。这同以色列人民和阿拉伯各国人民的安全利益是完全不相容的。
    以色列人和阿拉伯人在历史上曾经世世代代地和平相处，现在当然也能够和平相处。他们之间并没有不可调和的利害矛盾。目前巴勒斯坦的纠纷问题，是帝国主义长期挑拨的结果，中近东的紧张局势，是帝国主义干涉政策造成的。只要没有外来的干涉，我们相信，有关方面完全可以在平等的基础上，进行协商，和平解决巴勒斯坦问题。在和平协商中，应该照顾到阿拉伯人民的权利，将现有的某些不合理状况，加以适当的改变。只有这样做，才是符合所有中近东国家的根本利益的，也是符合一切爱好和平人民的希望的。
