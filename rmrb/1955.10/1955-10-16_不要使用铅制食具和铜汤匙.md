　　(I) To the Editor:
　　Among the eating utensils used by the broad masses of the people, some are lead-made, especially lead wine pots. The lead in these utensils will dissolve along with the food and be absorbed by the body through the digestive tract; at the same time, it will also pass through the liver into the small intestine. This can cause severe lead poisoning. Chronic lead poisoning can cause swelling and atrophy of brain tissue, and the disappearance of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord; or it can cause mental sluggishness, dizziness, poor sleep, constipation, abdominal cramps, limb paralysis, muscle tremors, mental confusion, convulsions, and other symptoms. In the later stages, it can also cause high blood pressure and hardening of the renal arteries, leading to disability or death. As an internist, I have encountered patients with this disease continuously.
　　In order to protect the health of the people, I suggest that all localities not manufacture or sell lead utensils, especially lead wine pots. At the same time, I hope that appropriate publicity will be given to this issue in newspapers and periodicals so that the masses can understand the hazards of using lead utensils.

　　(II) To the Editor:
　　Currently, some restaurants still use copper spoons, which I think is inappropriate. On the one hand, copper is a scarce metal raw material in our country and should be used where national construction needs it. On the other hand, copper is easily oxidized by carbon dioxide and moisture in the air, producing copper rust, which is a toxic compound that not only directly damages health but also has a coppery taste, affecting the taste of food. In addition, because copper conducts heat easily, using a copper spoon to scoop soup is far less effective than using a porcelain spoon. Therefore, I suggest that the catering industry in all localities, wherever copper spoons are still in use, should replace them with porcelain spoons.

    不要使用铅制食具和铜汤匙
    （一）编辑同志：
    在广大人民所用的食具中，有一部分是铅制的，特别是用铅酒壶的人较多。这些食具所含的铅会随着食物一并溶解，经消化道而被人体吸收；同时也会经过肝脏到小肠里。这样就会引起严重的铅中毒。慢性型铅中毒，可使脑组织浮肿、萎缩和使脊髓前灰白角细胞的消失；或者引起精神萎靡、头昏、睡眠不良、便秘、腹部绞痛、肢体瘫痪、肌肉震颤、精神错乱、惊厥等症状；晚期还可能引起血压升高和肾动脉硬化，使人残废或死亡。我是一个内科医生，就曾连续遇到这种病的患者。
    为了维护人民健康，我建议各地不要制造和出售铅制的食具，特别是铅质的酒壶。同时希望在报刊上对这个问题进行适当的宣传，使群众了解使用铅制食具的危害性。

    （二）编辑同志：
    目前有些饭馆里还用铜制的汤匙，我认为这是不合适的。因为一方面，铜是我国所缺少的金属原料，应该用到国家建设所需要的地方去。另一方面，铜容易和空气中的碳酸气和水分氧化而生铜锈，这是一种有毒的化合物，不但直接损害健康，而且还有铜腥味，影响食品的味道。此外，由于铜容易传热，用铜匙舀汤远不如用瓷匙好。因此，我建议各地饮食业，凡现在还用铜匙的，最好换用瓷匙。
