The Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee Sends a Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao and the State Council
Respected Chairman Mao and the State Council:
    On the occasion of the victorious opening of the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways, we, the entire staff of the Kanpo Lija Committee and the monks and laypeople under our jurisdiction, express our gratitude and respect to you and the State Council with utmost joy.
    In recent years, under your education, we have fully enjoyed the rights of national equality and freedom of religious belief, and are happily building our homeland. The opening of these two highways will accelerate the transformation of Tibet, especially the political, economic, and cultural landscape of the Rikaze area; our local products will be sold smoothly; and the industrial products and building materials we need will be supplied by the motherland. At the same time, it shortens the distance between Lhasa, Rikaze, and Gyantse, and further increases the internal unity of our Tibetan people. These two highways are the golden bridges leading to happiness for our Tibetan people, and they will bring us infinite happiness.
    Respected Chairman Mao! We will always unite closely around you. We will do a good job in the preparatory work for the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region and work together with the People's Liberation Army to continue our efforts to build Tibet.
            Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee, October 19, 1955
                                  Fourth day of the ninth month of the Wood-Sheep year in the Tibetan calendar

    班禅堪布会议厅委员会向毛主席、国务院
    致敬电敬爱的毛主席并国务院：
    值此拉日、日江两条公路胜利通车之际，我们堪布会议厅委员会全体工作人员及所属僧俗人民以万分愉快的心情，向您和国务院感谢并表示敬意。
    几年来，我们在您的教养下，充分地享受了民族平等权利和宗教信仰自由，愉快地建设着自己的家园。这两条公路的通车，将加速改变着西藏，尤其是日喀则地区政治、经济、文化的面貌；我们的土特产品将得到畅销；我们需要的工业产品、建筑器材将得到祖国的供应。同时缩短了拉萨、日喀则、江孜之间的距离，更进一步地增加了我们藏族内部的团结。这两条公路是我们西藏人民通向幸福的金桥，它将给我们带来无穷的幸福。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们永远紧紧地团结在您的周围。做好成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作，和人民解放军一道，为建设西藏而继续努力。
            班禅堪布会议厅委员会　一九五五年十月十九日
                                  藏历木羊年九月四日
