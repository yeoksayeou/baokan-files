    Demanding the French Government to Promote the Success of the Conference
    According to TASS, Paris, October 17th: French public opinion is eagerly hoping that the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Geneva will promote a further relaxation of international tensions. Many cities in France are holding mass rallies and gatherings, demanding that the French government promote the success of the conference.
    Many such gatherings have recently been held in Marseille. At one such gathering, local residents passed a letter to French Prime Minister Faure. The letter demanded that the French Foreign Minister "clearly advocate effective disarmament and the absolute prohibition of atomic weapons" at the Geneva conference, while "not imposing any preconditions." The letter continued, regarding the German question, "the vast majority of our people are very certain in advocating the establishment of a demilitarized, unified Germany that will not belong to any military bloc."
    The Peace Committees of Marne, Somme, Moselle, Ain, and other provinces have all written to the French government, demanding that the French representatives at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference adopt an attitude that is in accordance with the interests of peace, which is also in accordance with the national interests of the French people.

The meeting elected a joint delegation of West and East German workers, which will go to Geneva to present the demands of the German workers to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.
