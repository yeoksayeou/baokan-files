    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th. The "National Liaison Conference Against Military Bases" of Japan convened a national representative conference against military bases in Tokyo on the afternoon of October 19th.

    Participating in the meeting were representatives of residents near U.S. military bases in Japan, as well as relevant personnel from groups and political parties such as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Socialist Party.

    The meeting focused on discussing the issue of the Japanese government preparing to forcibly measure the land of residents in Sunagawa Town starting from October 25th in order to expand the U.S. Air Force base in Tachikawa. The meeting decided to demand that the government abandon its plan for forced measurement, and called on various mass organizations to support the struggle of Sunagawa Town residents against the expansion of military bases, and to work together to prevent the realization of the government's plan for forced measurement.

    The meeting decided to petition the U.S. House of Representatives Military Committee investigation group, which has arrived in Japan to investigate military facilities, expressing the will of the Japanese people to oppose U.S. military bases. The meeting also decided to convene a national convention against military bases in Tokyo on October 26th.

    At the same time, the residents of Sunagawa Town are also actively preparing to oppose the government's plan to forcibly measure land. All thirty-three farmers who received the government's notice to measure their land refused to accept the government's notice, and expressed their determination to unite around the Sunagawa Town Alliance Against Base Expansion and resolutely fight against the government's forced measurement behavior. The union united organization supporting the residents of Sunagawa Town also decided at a meeting held on the 17th that, when the government conducts the measurement, it will mobilize more union members to support the residents of Sunagawa Town, and when the U.S. House of Representatives Military Committee investigation group arrives in Sunagawa Town, it will hold a sit-down demonstration to protest the expansion of the U.S. military base.
