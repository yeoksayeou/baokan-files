    Hu Zhaokun Found His Position
    Sha Ting
    Under the clear sky, I walked through the terrazzo path connecting each building of the West Suburb Hostel, heading towards Building No. 5. I had arranged the day before to visit Hu Zhaokun. Hu Zhaokun is the director of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shenjia Village, Weixian County, Shandong Province. In 1951, when Shenjia Village established mutual aid teams, he was elected as the team leader. In the winter of 1952, when the mutual aid team transformed into a cooperative, he again served as the director.
    Now, except for four landlord households, three counter-revolutionary households, two cart-driving households, and one merchant household, all agricultural residents of Shenjia Village have joined the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative. This is a gratifying achievement, but attaining it was not easy. In the development process of the Red Star Cooperative, Hu Zhaokun encountered many difficulties and engaged in numerous struggles. In the early stages of the cooperative's establishment, due to limited increased production and a chaotic system, a few members wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. However, he was not discouraged and, with the help of the county party committee, finally consolidated the cooperative.
    When I met Hu Zhaokun for the second time, I remembered that, in our previous conversation, this capable and tall young man had talked to me about his experience in resolving the issue of resuming his studies. Our conversation began by revisiting this issue.
    Due to temporary difficulties in his family life, Hu Zhaokun dropped out of Weifang Middle School in 1950 during his second year of junior high school. He planned to resume his studies in a year or so. This idea was quite persistent. After returning to the countryside, constantly subjected to stimulation and ridicule from some people, he felt that engaging in agricultural labor was not very honorable. That autumn, when the district party secretary mobilized him to participate in grain requisition work, he refused, using the excuse of preparing to resume his studies. When he was elected as the leader of the mutual aid team, he raised the same reason: "I still want to go to school!" However, just as he had treated the district party secretary's mobilization, when he thought about matters concerning the interests of the masses, he still relented and did a good job.
    Relenting, of course, did not equate to a thorough ideological resolution. Therefore, when he was elected as a township people's representative and a township people's committee member in 1951, he reiterated his desire – to still go to school. Moreover, by the autumn of 1952, the temporarily suppressed idea resurfaced. When going to the market, he often heard news such as: this classmate is working on the railway, that one has been promoted to a higher school! Or relatives and acquaintances would ask him why he was not going to school?…
    In order to achieve the goal of resuming his studies, he even deliberately avoided approaching the district party secretary.
    "Why?" He repeated my question with a loud laugh, as if the rhetorical question reminded him of incredibly pleasant past events, "The district party secretary is so good, as soon as you meet him, you will reveal all your thoughts to him. He won't touch you, nor will he laugh at you, but slowly getting pulled in with him, you can't help yourself, and your thoughts will be straightened out!"
    "But the district party secretary still found out!" I interjected jokingly.
    "Yes! Seeing that they couldn't persuade me, Hu Junde, a member of the mutual aid team, went alone to find the district party secretary. One evening, a team member suddenly ran over to call me, saying that the district party secretary was waiting for me at the people's school! When I heard that, I was blown away, constantly calculating in my mind: should I go, or should I not go?…
    "Finally, I thought, an ugly daughter-in-law eventually has to meet her in-laws, so I went to the people's school.
    "When I arrived at the people's school, I realized that it wasn't just the district party secretary, there were several team members sitting with him.
    "As soon as we met, the district party secretary asked, 'I heard you're planning to go to school?'
    "I replied in a daze, 'Yes, do you think it's okay?'
    "The district party secretary said: 'Okay, why not?'
    "I felt a little relieved, breathed a sigh of relief and said, 'That's right! The mutual aid team is doing well, there's a future, and I need to find my own future too.'
    "The district party secretary abruptly cut me off, saying, 'If you want to find a future, you still need to go into deep water!' The district party secretary then slowly started to guide me…'"
    The district party secretary talked about the achievements of the mutual aid team over the years, the trust the masses had in Hu Zhaokun, the struggles of some agricultural labor models, and then pointed out: Hu Zhaokun's future was already clearly laid out there, no need to look for it anymore – this is the great socialist future!
    Hu Zhaokun frankly told me: In the middle of this, he had tried to defend himself, but some words, as soon as he spoke them, felt wrong; some words he couldn't say at all. He said that by the end, he was covered in sweat, and increasingly felt that leaving a work post that the party and the masses urgently needed him to stay at was too selfish!
    Although the district party secretary had stopped speaking, Hu Zhaokun had not yet expressed his opinion. The team members didn't say anything, but they wholeheartedly hoped that Hu Zhaokun could thoroughly sort out his thoughts this time. And in the end, they couldn't bear it any longer and all urged him: "It should be clear now, the district party secretary has been talking for half the night." "What about it? You going to school is also for the socialist future…"
    At this point, Hu Zhaokun finally stood up to express his opinion to everyone: "Let's go into deep water! The party is caring for and cultivating me like this…"
    When Hu Zhaokun was narrating this experience to me, his mood was healthy, because from then on, he no longer reviewed geometry and algebra every night, but devoted all his spare time to the study of agricultural techniques. He had long attached great importance to the improvement of agricultural technology. In 1951, he helped his father summarize his tobacco planting experience and adopted advanced methods, resulting in a doubling of the yield per mu of tobacco compared to 1950. In 1952, he led the team members to improve the entire farming process, changing from three crops every two years to four crops every two years, resulting in an increase of more than 10,000 jin of grain for the whole team.
    These achievements enhanced Hu Zhaokun's enthusiasm for learning technology and promoting advanced experience. He bought many agricultural technical books and read them whenever he had time. Moreover, he often disrupted his life order, eating poorly or getting out of bed in the middle of the night to look up books because he was considering a practical problem. The mole crickets in the paddy fields around Shenjia Village were numerous, causing damage to many crops every year. According to the old method, only mixing millet with "arsenic stone" could resist them; but this was too wasteful. In 1954, he introduced a new method of mixing "666" with wheat bran, which was very effective and reduced waste at the same time. But that summer, there was a temporary shortage of wheat bran, and it couldn't be found anywhere.
    This was a big problem, because there were more mole crickets than in previous years, and if it was delayed, the crops would be damaged.
    "The team members' thinking was also quite confused," Hu Zhaokun recalled the scene at the time: "Many people advocated mixing millet with '666'. They said: 'Anyway, the cooperative still has grain, we can't delay any longer!' But I was always reluctant: it's such a big waste! Later I thought of using rice bran mixed with '666'."
    "What was the result?" I couldn't help but ask.
    "It didn't work at all! The rice bran was mixed dry, the mole crickets wouldn't eat it, and they wouldn't die from the medicine! Now everyone was complaining to me, 'I told you not to mess around! Don't waste your efforts!' But I was still unwilling to give up, and still pondered over the rice bran. One day, feeling bored, I wandered around aimlessly and somehow ended up at the pig farm. This reminded me of something: once when I was fooling around, I tasted pig feed, and the bran was sweet! – Now I found the trick!"
    "This time you must have succeeded!" I interjected, having already guessed the outcome from his expression.
    "Of course I succeeded! Think about it, just like making pig feed, mix the rice bran with '666' with water, put it in a basin and cover it, the taste changes, and the mole crickets are willing to eat it. That night, dozens of them were poisoned. The next night, one or two hundred were poisoned! I strung them together and held them in my hand for everyone to see, 'You didn't believe they could be poisoned, what do you say now?'…"
    He gestured to tell me that by changing millet to rice bran, they saved 500 jin of grain every year.
    Due to continuous technological innovation, by now, the grain yield of the entire Shenjia Village has increased nearly doubled compared to before liberation. But Hu Zhaokun is not satisfied with this, believing that as long as he continues to improve farming techniques and tap the potential of the land, it is possible to produce more grain to support the country's industrialization construction; but he feels that his cultural and scientific knowledge is too insufficient.
    When talking about this, he seemed a little anxious, a sense of solemn responsibility clearly made him feel that things were not very easy.
    At this time, he crossed his legs on the edge of the bed, playing with a rubber band for tying books in his hand.
    "Yes! To engage in socialism, agriculture is a great field of learning." He said enthusiastically and loudly, when I quoted Lenin's words to further illustrate the significant role of scientific knowledge in the agricultural cooperative movement, "Our village's soil has several types: black soil, clay, yellow soil, semi-sandy soil… The old people all know what to plant in this kind of soil, and what is not suitable for this kind of soil. For example, black soil is not good for growing wheat. But what is their chemical composition? How is it appropriate to fertilize? This requires scientific knowledge to figure out!"
    He stopped, showing a contemplative look; opening and closing, his hands pulled the rubber band very large.
    "Now even my father feels he can't do it anymore!" Finally, he looked at me and said: "In 1951, when I adopted new methods of planting tobacco, he opposed me so much! He always said, 'I have been planting tobacco for thirty or forty years, can't I even keep up with you?' It took a lot of talking to do the experiment once. Now he is convinced, and always says to me, 'These two years of studying have been worthwhile, haven't gone to waste!'…"
    He laughed heartily; then told me that his father was an old farmer, with a lot of experience in growing crops.
    I wanted to understand more about the ideological struggle in promoting advanced farming techniques, and I told him my wish.
    "There are many struggles!" He waved his arm excitedly, and involuntarily stood up from the bed, "In 1951, I advocated using 'Xilisheng' to mix with wheat seeds, to avoid growing so much 'wild wheat' – some up to seventy percent! But many people opposed it! They said that the abundance of 'wild wheat' was due to bad 'natural years', where would there be any germs. They also gave me difficult questions to do: 'Take out the germs and let us see!' I said, 'Those are germs! Look at them? Easy to say!' 'How do you know then?' 'It's written in the book!' 'Does the person who wrote the book have the ability to see?' 'They have a microscope!' 'That's right, you should also find a microscope to see and then talk!…'"
    Hu Zhaokun laughed again, but this laugh had no hint of contempt, and was full of sympathy.
    "Farmers believe what they see!" He then continued, "If they haven't seen it, they won't believe it. Finally, I said, 'If you don't believe it, I'll do it for you to see first!' In 1952, everyone saw that it was indeed true, there was very little wild wheat in my wheat field, and only then did some people start to try it."
    Remembering the habits of the older generation of farmers that I knew, I couldn't help but laugh at this time.
    "Do you think they completely believed it?" Hu Zhaokun immediately asked back, obviously misunderstanding my meaning, "No! It wasn't until 1953 that everyone was using it, and there were still people saying to me, 'Let me tell you! You were only convinced in words before, now your thoughts are finally clear.'"
    Finally, we talked about the issue of cadre work style, and at my request, he also told me several things about himself. What moved me the most was something that happened during the New Year of 1954.
    The story is like this: The Red Star Cooperative raised thirty or forty pigs, all of which were very strong, each weighing more than two hundred jin. And they had already signed a contract with the state, preparing to transport them abroad to exchange for machines. Therefore, the entire cooperative attached great importance to this batch of pigs. But the day before the New Year, Hu Zhaokun suddenly noticed that the feeder Hu Honglai's expression was a bit unusual, always smiling at him unnaturally; he seemed to have something to say, but it was difficult to express. Hu Zhaokun determined that he had something on his mind, and asked him why he was always smiling.
    Hu Honglai replied, "Smiling about what, it's going to be New Year tomorrow!"
    Hu Zhaokun said, "Yes! What about it?"
    Hu Honglai said, "What about it? Find someone else! I want to take a few days off…"
    This was an unreasonable request, and it was immediately refuted by other team members.
    "You're not working during the New Year? That's nonsense!"
    "You want to visit relatives, don't others have relatives?"
    "He's afraid of getting his new clothes dirty!…"
    These noisy accusations made Hu Honglai very embarrassed.
    "Okay!" Hu Zhaokun said at this time, looking at the embarrassed Hu Honglai, and patted the other person's shoulder, "You can rest tomorrow, I'll find someone to replace you!"
    "That's too cheap for him!" Someone muttered, disagreeing with Hu Zhaokun's approach.
    "Where are you going to find activists these two days?" Someone also warned Hu Zhaokun.
    "Don't worry! There are plenty of activists, you just wait and see."
    Although Hu Zhaokun said it with confidence, the team members all felt that things were not going well. Therefore, on New Year's Day, those team members who were dressed up and ready to rest for two days, went to the pig farm one after another as soon as they finished breakfast. Because they all wanted to find out as soon as possible, what kind of person the activist that the director found was.
    The scene by the pigsty surprised everyone: Hu Zhaokun, also dressed up, was busy feeding the pigs. They laughed and said: "So the one you found was yourself!" They then walked over and fought to replace the feeder's job…
    The story was just being told here, someone came to urge Hu Zhaokun to go to a meeting. It was very inappropriate to keep him here, we warmly shook hands and said goodbye.

    胡兆坤找到了自己的岗位
    沙汀
    在晴朗的天空下，我穿过连结西郊旅舍每一座楼房的水门汀便道，向五号楼走去。前一天我就约好了要看看胡兆坤。胡兆坤是山东潍县申家村红星农业生产合作社的社长。一九五一年申家村成立互助组时，他就被选为组长。一九五二年冬天互助组转为社，他又担任了社长的职务。
    现在，除了四户地主、三户反革命分子、两户赶车的和一户商贩，申家村全村农业人口，都已经加入了红星农业生产合作社。这是一个可喜的成就，但是得到这个成就可不那么容易。在红星社的发展过程当中，胡兆坤就曾经碰到过不少困难，进行过不少斗争。建社初期，由于增产不多，制度混乱，少数社员就闹着要退社。但他并不气馁，终于在县委帮助下使社得到巩固。
    当我同胡兆坤第二次见面时，我记得，在上次谈话中，这个精干的高个子年青人曾经向我谈到他自己解决复学问题的经过。我们谈话一开始就又接触到这个问题。
    因为家庭生活一时发生困难，胡兆坤一九五○年在潍坊中学读初中二年级时休了学。他准备一年半载后再复学。这个想法是相当顽强的。而在回到农村以后，由于不断受到某些人的刺激和嘲笑，他就更加感觉参加农业劳动不很光彩。这年秋天，当区委书记动员他参加征粮工作时，他就曾用准备复学作理由表示拒绝。成立互助组被选为组长时，他也提出过同一理由：“我还要上学呵！”可是，正同他对待区委书记的动员那样，当一想到这是有关群众利益的事，他还是让步了，而且干得很好。
    让步当然并不等于思想上彻底解决问题。因此当一九五一年他被选为乡人民代表和乡人民委员的时候，他又重复表白他的愿望——还要上学。而且，到了一九五二年秋天，那个暂时压制住的念头，又重新抬头了。在赶集时，他往往会听到这样一些消息：这个同学在铁路上工作，那一个升学了！或者亲戚熟人问他为什么还不上学？……
    为了达到复学的目的，他还故意不同区委书记接近。
    “为什么？”他大笑着重复我的问话，好像我提出的反问使他回忆起了无比愉快的往事，“区委书记那么好，一见面你会什么思想都向他暴露。他不会碰你的，也不会笑话你，可是慢慢同他一拉，就不由得你自己了，思想就通了！”
    “可是区委书记还是知道了！”我打趣地插嘴说。
    “是呀！看见劝我不住，互助组的组员胡君德就一个人找区委书记去了。有一天晚上，一个组员忽然跑来叫我，说，区委书记在民校等我呢！我一听，炸了，心里老是那么盘算：去呢，不去？……
    “最后我想，丑媳妇终归要见公婆，就到民校去了。
    “到民校一看，我才知道，不止是区委书记，还有好几个组员同区委书记坐在一道。
    “一见面区委书记就问，‘听说你准备上学呀？’
    “我懵里懵懂答道，‘是呀，你看行吧？’
    “区委书记说：‘行，怎么不行？’
    “我多少有一点放心了，松口气说，‘这就对！互助组也搞好了，有前途了，我呢，也得找我自己的前途。’
    “区委书记冷不防切断我的话道，‘要找前途，你还得下深水！’区委书记接着慢慢拉起来了。……”
    区委书记从互助组几年来的成就，谈到群众对胡兆坤的信赖，谈到一些农业劳动模范的奋斗经历，然后指出：胡兆坤的前途已经明明白白摆在那里，用不着再找了——这就是伟大的社会主义前途！
    胡兆坤坦白地告诉我：这中间，他也曾经企图替自己辩解，但是，有的话，他刚一说出口，就感觉不对头；有的话始终说不出来。他说，谈到最后他满头大汗，越来越觉得离开一个党和群众迫切需要自己坚持的工作岗位，太自私了！
    区委书记虽然已经停止了讲话，但是胡兆坤还没有表示自己的意见。组员们不吱声，可是他们一心指望胡兆坤这一次能够彻底打通思想。而末了，他们实在耐不住了，就一齐劝说道：“应该通了，区委书记讲了这么半夜。”“怎么样呢？你上学也是为的社会主义前途呵……”
    这时，胡兆坤终于站起来向大家表示自己的意见：“下深水吧！党这样关怀和培养我……”
    当胡兆坤向我叙述这段经历的时候，他的情绪是健康的，因为从此他不再每天晚上复习几何代数，把工余时间全部搁在农业技术的钻研上。他早就非常重视农业技术的改进工作。一九五一年，他帮助父亲总结了种烟的经验同时又采用了先进方法，结果每亩烟的产量比一九五○年增产一倍。一九五二年，他领导组员们改进了整个耕种程序，把每两年种三季改为每两年种四季，使得全组增产一万多斤粮食。
    这些成就提高了胡兆坤学习技术，推广先进经验的积极性。他买了很多农业技术书籍，一有时间就读。而且，常常因为考虑一个实际问题，连生活秩序都打乱了，吃不好饭或半夜从床上爬起来翻书。申家村一带谷田的蝼蛄是很多的，每年都要蹧害不少庄稼。依照旧的方法，只有用小米拌“信石”可以抵制；但这太浪费了。一九五四年他介绍了“六六六”拌麦麸的新方法，成效很好，同时减少了浪费。但是这一年夏天，麦麸一时缺货，哪里都弄不到手。
    这是个大问题，因为蝼蛄比往年多，搞迟了庄稼就会遭到损害。
    “社员的思想也相当混乱”，胡兆坤追述当时的情景道：“好多人都主张用小米拌‘六六六’。他们说：‘横竖社里还有谷子，不能够再拖了！’可是我总不愿意：这浪费好大呀！后来才想到用谷糠拌‘六六六’。”
    “结果怎么样呢？”我忍不住追问道。
    “一点也不管用！谷糠是干拌的，蝼蛄不吃，药不死呀！这下大家都抱怨我，‘我说你乱搞吧！别白费功夫了！’可是我总不死心，还是在谷糠上打谱。有一天，闷得慌，我东荡西荡，不知怎么跑到养猪场去了。这使我想起了一件事：有一次我闹着玩尝过猪食，糠是甜的！——这下我找到窍门了！”
    “这回你一定成功了！”我插嘴道，已经从他的神色猜到了事情的结果。
    “当然是成功了！你想，就像搞猪食样，把谷糠同‘六六六’用水一拌，搁在盆子里一捂，味道变了，蝼蛄也肯吃了。当天晚上，就药死了好几十个。隔了一夜，就药死了一两百个！我把它们穿成一串，提在手里要大家看，‘你们不相信药得死，这下怎么说呢？’……”
    他比比手势，告诉我说，把小米改成谷糠，他们每年要节约五百斤粮食。
    由于技术上的不断革新，到了目前，申家村全村的粮食产量，已经比解放前增长了近一倍了。但是胡兆坤并不因此满足，认为只要继续改进耕作技术，发掘土地的潜力，还可能生产更多的粮食来支援国家的工业化建设；但他感觉他的文化科学知识太不够了。
    当谈到这点的时候，他显得有点着急，一种庄严的责任感显然使他感觉事情并不怎么轻松。
    这时他把两条腿盘在床沿边上，手里舞弄着一根扎书用的橡筋。
    “是呀！要搞社会主义，农业是一门大学问呵。”他热情地高声说，当我引用列宁的话，进一步说明科学知识在农业合作运动中的重大作用的时候，“我们村的土有好几种：黑土、粘土、黄土、半沙土……老年人都懂得这种土该种什么，什么对这种土不适宜。比方黑土，种小麦就不肯出。可是它们的化学成分怎样？怎么喂肥合适？这需要有科学知识才能闹得清楚！”
    他停下来，现出沉思的神气；一张一合的，双手把那橡筋拉得很大。
    “现在连我父亲也感觉他不行了！”最后他望定我说：“一九五一年采用新方法种烟，他好反对我呀！总说，‘我种了三四十年的烟，还赶不上你？’为了试验一次，不知费了多少话。现在算服气了，老向我说，‘这两年书念得值得，没有碰瞎！’……”
    他爽朗地笑起来；随即告诉我说，他父亲是个老农，种庄稼很有经验。
    我想更多了解一些推广先进耕作技术中的思想斗争情形，我向他说出了我的愿望。
    “斗争多呵！”他很激动地挥挥手臂，不由自主地从床边站起来，“一九五一年我主张用‘西力生’拌麦种，免得长起来那么多‘乌麦’，——有的多到百分之七十几呵！可是好多人反对！他们说‘乌麦’多是‘天年’不好，哪里来什么病菌。还出难题给我做：‘把病菌拿出看看吧！’我说，‘那是病菌呀！看看？说得容易！’‘哪你怎么知道的呢？’‘书上写得有呀！’‘写书的人他就有本事看见？’‘人家有显微镜呀！’‘对呀，你也找个显微镜看看说吧！’……”
    胡兆坤又一次失声笑了，但这笑没有丝毫轻视的意思，而且充满了同情。
      “农民都是眼见为实的！”他又接着说，“没有看见过他就不信。最后我说，‘你们不相信，我先来做给你们看吧！’一九五二年大家一看，果然不错，我家麦田里很少有乌麦了，这才有人开始试用。”
    想起了我所知道的老一辈农民的习惯，这时候我也忍不住笑起来。
    “你以为他们就完全相信了吗？”胡兆坤紧接着反问，显然误解了我的意思，“不！一直到一九五三年大家都用开了，还有人向我说，‘告诉你吧！原早是嘴上通，现在思想才算通了。’”
    最后，我们又谈到了干部作风问题，在我的请求下，他还告诉了我好几桩他自己的事情。最使我感动的是一九五四年新年当中发生的一件事情。
    事情是这样的：红星社养了三四十头毛猪，都已经很壮了，每一头有二百多斤。而且已经同国家订了合同，准备运出国换机器。因此全社都很重视这一批毛猪。但是年节的前一天，胡兆坤忽然发觉饲养员胡宏来的神气有点反常，老是对他不很自然地笑；似乎有话想说，但又难以出口。胡兆坤断定他有心事，就问他为什么老是笑。
    胡宏来答道，“笑什么，明天就过年了！”
    胡兆坤说道，“是呀！怎么样呢？”
    胡宏来道，“怎么样？另外找个人吧！我想请几天假……”
    这是一个毫无道理的请求，它立刻遭到了别的社员的反驳。
    “过年你不干了？这不是说瞎话！”
    “你想串亲戚，别人没有亲戚？”
    “他怕把新衣服弄脏了！……”
    这些七嘴八舌的责难弄得胡宏来很窘迫。
    “好吧！”这时候胡兆坤说话了，他望着那个狼狈不堪的胡宏来，又拍了拍对方的肩头，“你明天休息吧，我找个人代替你！”
    “这太便宜他了！”有人嘀嘀咕咕不同意胡兆坤的作法。
    “这两天你到哪里去找积极分子呵？”也有人向胡兆坤提出警告。
    “不要担心！有的是积极分子，你们等着瞧吧。”
    尽管胡兆坤说的满有把握，但是社员们全都感觉事情很不好办。因此，到了新年这天，那些穿戴一新，准备好好休息两天的社员们，刚一吃过早饭，就陆续走向养猪场去。因为他们都想早一点弄清楚，社长找的积极分子是怎样一个人。
    猪圈边的情景使他们每个人都吃了一惊：同样穿戴一新的胡兆坤正在那里忙着喂猪。他们大笑说：“原来找的你自己呀！”他们随即走了过去，争着代替饲养员的职务……
    故事正讲到这里，有人来催促胡兆坤去开会。还要把他留下来是很不合适的，我们热情地握手告别了。
