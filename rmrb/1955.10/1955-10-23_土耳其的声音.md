    The international situation has eased, but Turkey is still following the United States in expanding its military and preparing for war. This policy has increasingly isolated Turkey among its many neighbors, and has also led to economic hardship and popular discontent at home. Turkish public opinion is becoming increasingly vocal in its dissatisfaction.

    A recent article in the Turkish magazine "Akis" entitled "A Glimpse of Our Foreign Policy" pointed out the setbacks Turkey has encountered in pursuing its "Cold War" policy. "Akis" magazine said that Turkey's participation in the Turco-Iraqi Pact "caused unease in Israel and failed to attract Arab countries," and that "Syria and Egypt have also adopted a hostile stance towards it." Regarding the "Balkan Pact" concluded between Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece, the pact's military system has "completely collapsed." And in Turkey's relations with Greece, "enmity has replaced friendship." After describing this unpleasant situation between Turkey and its neighbors, the author of the article said that Turkey's current situation is "far from glorious" because Turkey's ruling group "has not adopted the necessary methods to study the recently changed situation" and has not drawn the correct conclusions from it.

    Turkey's "inglorious" situation exists not only in its diplomacy but also in its domestic affairs. A recent appeal published in the "Balkan and Middle East" bulletin in Beirut by a group of Turkish social figures depicted the tragic situation of Turkey under the burden of military expansion and war preparation. The appeal stated: "Turkey is weakening day by day under the burden of preparing for modern warfare... Turkey is unable to stand upright under the burden of an army of 500,000 men. Half of Turkey's budget is allocated to the military; the country is preparing to send its strong, able-bodied sons to die for the United States... The country has lost its independence and is under the yoke of the United States. Our treasury is empty. We have become the debtors of the whole world. We have been reduced to the status of a colony supplying raw materials to American factories... We have finally reached a dead end."

    The Turkish people, who bear all the dangerous consequences of military expansion and war preparation, demand a way out of this predicament, and all those who cherish their nation's future also demand a way out. The development of the international situation around the Geneva Four-Power Conference has made many Turks realize where the way out lies. The group of Turkish social figures mentioned above pointed out in the appeal: "It is very clear: maintain neutrality and do not get involved in the disputes of the great powers... Only neutrality can guarantee our peace, tranquility, and security." The appeal stated: "If we become a neutral country, we will be able to pursue a genuine policy of peace. Our borders will be guaranteed, which will make it unnecessary for us to maintain a large army and bear huge military expenses. The billions of liras we now spend on the military can be used to improve the living standards of our people, for the people's cultural and health undertakings. Instead of owning tanks, rifles, and military aircraft, we will build schools, hospitals, and factories."

    This sober voice, coming from Turkey, which is suffocating under the "Cold War" atmosphere, fully expresses the Turkish people's desire for peace, and this desire will sooner or later produce an irresistible force.

### 土耳其的声音

    土耳其的声音
    国际局势有了缓和，土耳其却还是跟着美国扩军备战。这种政策使土耳其在它的许多邻国中间越来越孤立，在国内也闹得民穷财尽。土耳其舆论的不满越来越显露了。
    土耳其“阿基斯”杂志最近发表的题为“我国外交政策的一瞥”的文章，就指出了土耳其所奉行的“冷战”政策处处碰壁的情形。“阿基斯”杂志说，土耳其参加土—伊协定“引起了以色列的不安，而且没有能把阿拉伯国家吸引过来”，“叙利亚和埃及对此也采取敌对立场”；在土耳其和南斯拉夫、希腊缔结的“巴尔干公约”方面，公约的军事体系是“完全崩溃了”；而在土耳其和希腊的关系上，“敌对代替了友谊”。文章作者在描述了土耳其和它的邻国的这种不愉快的情景以后说，土耳其目前的处境“远不是光彩的”，原因就是土耳其的统治集团“没有采取应有的方法来研究近来变化了的局势”，没有从中得出正确的结论。
    土耳其的“不光彩”的处境不仅存在于它的外交方面，同样也存在于它的内政方面。土耳其一批社会名流最近在贝鲁特出版的“巴尔干和中东”通报上发表的一篇呼吁书，描绘了土耳其在扩军备战的重担下的悲惨情景。呼吁书说：“土耳其在准备近代战争的重担之下，一天天地衰弱下去……土耳其被五十万人的军队重担压得直不起腰了。土耳其的预算拨款有一半用于军队；国家准备让自己身强力壮的、能够做有益劳动的儿子去替美国送死……国家丧失了自己的独立，处于美国枷锁之下。我们的国库已经空虚。我们成了全世界的负债者。我们已沦落到以原料供应美国工厂的殖民地的地位。……我们终于陷入了绝境。”
    承担着扩军备战的一切危险后果的土耳其人民要求走出这个绝境，一切珍惜自己的民族前途的人也要求走出这个绝境。日内瓦四大国会议前后国际局势的发展，已经使得许多土耳其人认识到出路在哪里。上面提到的一批土耳其社会名流在呼吁书上指出：“十分明显：保持中立，不卷入大国的争论。……只有中立才能保障我们的和平、宁静和安全。”呼吁书说：“如果我们成为一个中立国，我们就能够执行真正的和平政策。我们的国境将得到保障，这就使我们不必要维持大量的军队，负担巨大的军事费用。我们现在花费在军队上面的几十亿里拉，就可以用来提高我们人民的生活水平、用于人民的文化和卫生事业，而不必拥有坦克、步枪和军用飞机，我们将建筑学校、医院和工厂。”
    从被“冷战”气氛压得透不过气来的土耳其传出来的这种清醒的声音，充分表达了土耳其人民的和平愿望，而这种愿望迟早将会产生出不可抗拒的力量。　（德）
