To the Editor:

At present, it is the season for harvesting crops. Seizing the opportunity to extensively educate the masses of farmers on conserving grain is a very important matter. As far as I understand, many regions, especially those that suffered from natural disasters last year, have already attached importance to this work since the summer harvest. In Longyao County, Hebei Province, the eighteen townships and seventy-one villages of the Fourth District, households have made savings plans, advocating methods such as grinding coarse flour mixed with vegetables to save grain, saving a total of more than 147,800 jin of grain. In Cheng Village, Cang County, Twelfth District, 192 households used fine grains for coarse processing and mixing with vegetables, saving 875 jin of grain in ten days. The Fourteenth District of Hengshan County, Hunan Province, also held a special meeting to study ways to save grain. Jiazao Township in this district put forward the slogan "Three Changes and Four Attentions" in terms of conservation, the specific contents of which are: changing fine rice to糙米 (coarse rice), hard rice to thin porridge, changing to using chaff to feed chickens and ducks, and paying attention to not letting children waste food, paying attention to using miscellaneous grains instead of staple grains, paying attention to not holding banquets, and paying attention to rice milling techniques. In addition to advocating mixing bran and vegetables in daily life to save money, many areas have also studied harvesting techniques, and organized the elderly, women, and children to go to the fields to pick up wheat grains and ears of grain, increasing grain income.

However, there are also individual areas where the masses lack long-term planning, eating and drinking extravagantly after the harvest, and even squandering and wasting. For example, in Wangzhuangzi, Cang County, Hebei Province, a family of four harvested 170 jin of wheat and ate 140 jin in nine days; in addition to what people ate, they also used wheat to feed livestock, chickens and ducks. After the early rice harvest, members of the Qunli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xifu Township, Yuanjiang County, Hunan, ate four meals a day. Farmers in Fudong Township generally eat three meals of dry rice a day, and a full laborer consumes about three or four jin of rice per day; some households cook too much rice to eat, so they dry the rice and eat it as snacks. Some households hold lavish banquets and entertain relatives and friends when holding weddings, funerals, and other celebrations. These situations show that promoting grain conservation after the autumn harvest is still a very necessary task. It is hoped that local governments will continue to deeply educate the masses, carefully calculate every grain in the barns, and use resources wisely; at the same time, farmers who do well in conservation should be commended, and farmers who squander and waste should be educated and criticized, so that a good atmosphere of active production and strict economy can be fostered in the countryside.

    秋收后要注意对农民进行节约粮食的教育编辑同志：
    目前正是农作物收获的季节。抓紧时机，广泛地向农民群众进行节约粮食的教育，是非常重要的一件事。据我了解，不少地区，特别是去年遭受自然灾害的地区，在夏收以后，各级人民委员会就已经重视了这一工作。河北省隆尧县四区的十八个乡、七十一个村，户户订了节约计划，提倡以磨粗面掺菜等办法来节约粮食，共节约粮食十四万七千八百多斤。沧县十二区程庄一百九十二户用细粮粗作和掺菜的办法，十天就节省了粮食八百七十五斤。湖南省衡山县第十四区还特别召开了会议研究节约粮食的办法。这个区的甲枣乡在节约方面提出了“三改四注意”的口号，具体内容是：细米改糙米，硬饭改稀饭，改用糠皮喂鸡鸭和注意不让小孩浪费，注意用杂粮代主粮，注意不做酒席，注意碾米技术。除了在日常生活上提倡掺糠拌菜省吃俭用外，不少地区还研究了收割技术，并组织老人、妇女、小孩下地拾麦粒、谷穗，增收了很多粮食。
    但是也有个别地区的群众缺乏长期打算，收割以后大吃大喝，甚至挥霍浪费。如河北省沧县王庄子有一户四口人，打了一百七十斤麦子，九天就吃了一百四十斤；除了人吃的以外，喂牲口、喂鸡鸭都是用麦子。湖南沅江县熙福乡群力农业生产合作社社员在早稻收割以后，每天吃四餐。福东乡的农民一般每天都吃三餐干饭，全劳动力每天大约要吃掉大米三、四斤；有的户饭做得太多吃不了，就将饭晒干当零嘴吃。有的户在做婚丧喜庆等事时，大摆酒席，招待亲友。这些情况说明秋收以后提倡节约粮食仍是十分必要的工作。希望各地政府继续深入地教育群众，在囤尖上精打细算，细水长流；同时对节约好的农民要进行表扬，对挥霍浪费的农民要进行教育和批评，使农村中养成积极生产和厉行节约的好风气。　　　唐履仁
