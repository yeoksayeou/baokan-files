    "Bima No. 1" Wheat Widely Sown in Southern Shanxi
    In recent years, the Jinan area of Shanxi Province, which is rich in wheat, has achieved good results in the trial planting of the "Bima No. 1" wheat improved variety. Farmers in the entire area generally request to expand the planting area. Farmers in the main wheat-producing counties require that the planting area can reach 20 percent of the wheat field area, and the highest counties can reach 70 percent. It is estimated that the area can be sown more than 2.5 million mu, accounting for about 22 percent of the total wheat field area, which is more than ten times higher than the planting area in 1954. The yield of "Bima No. 1" wheat is generally 15 percent higher than that of local wheat. According to this increased yield ratio, the area will be able to increase wheat production by 45 million jin next year only by promoting improved varieties. At present, farmers are actively selecting seeds in preparation for sowing. (Wang Junqi)

    晋南广泛播种“碧蚂一号”小麦
    盛产小麦的山西省晋南专区，近几年试种“碧蚂一号”小麦良种效果良好，全区农民普遍要求扩大种植面积。主要产麦县份的农民要求种植面积可达到麦田面积的百分之二十，最高的县可达到百分之七十，预计全区共可播种二百五十多万亩，占全区麦田面积的百分之二十二左右，比一九五四年种植面积增加了十倍以上。“碧蚂一号”小麦产量一般较当地小麦增产百分之十五，据这个增产比例推算，全区仅推广优良品种一项，明年将可增产小麦四千五百万斤。目前，农民正在积极拣选种籽，准备播种。                     （王俊奇）
