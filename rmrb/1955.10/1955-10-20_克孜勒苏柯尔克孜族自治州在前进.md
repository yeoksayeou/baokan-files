In August, at the height of the agricultural and pastoral harvest, I came to Artush, the capital of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang. This is a young and beautiful city. New buildings are under construction everywhere here. Recently completed are the offices and school buildings of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, the CCP Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture Local Committee, the People's Bank, the Trade Company, the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, and the middle school. There are still a large number of construction projects, including cultural centers, parks, and cinemas, which are also under construction or being prepared for construction.

This area, which six years ago was still called a desolate Gobi desert, has taken on a new look in a very short period of time. This is something that people in the past could not have imagined. In the year or so since the establishment of the autonomous prefecture, great achievements have been made in construction in all fields. This is a vivid example of the rapid development of construction undertakings in minority areas under the glorious illumination of the Communist Party's ethnic policies.

The autonomous prefecture is the main pastoral area in southern Xinjiang. At the time of liberation, animal husbandry production here was in a state of collapse due to the long-term and cruel plunder by reactionary rulers. Uqturpan County, the main pastoral county, had only 20,000 head of small livestock and 9,000 head of large livestock in 1949. After liberation, the Party and the government helped and supported the herdsmen in developing animal husbandry production in all aspects. According to statistics for the first half of this year, the county's small livestock has increased to more than 215,000 head, and the large livestock to more than 28,000 head. The government has established state-owned trading institutions in pastoral areas and opened up sales channels for animal products. In 1954, state-owned trading companies purchased 66 percent more animal products than in 1953, of which wool alone exceeded 200 tons; the production and living materials supplied to herdsmen increased by 55 percent compared with 1953. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels have also vigorously purchased animal products and supplied materials. At present, there are 11 grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, 8 trading stores, 22 mobile sales teams, and 22 farm tool and local product processing plants in the entire autonomous prefecture.

Agricultural production in the autonomous prefecture is also developing rapidly. After the mutual aid and cooperation movement was widely carried out in agricultural areas, the yield per unit area of various crops has been continuously improved. The peasants have all seen the benefits of being organized, and a craze for joining agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups has been formed. In Artush County alone, organized farmers account for more than 36 percent of the county's total number of farmers.

Since liberation, people's hospitals have been established in Artush, Akqi, and Uqturpan counties. Farmers and herdsmen no longer need to travel long distances to Kashgar for treatment when they are sick. In the old society, the children of farmers and herdsmen had no right to education. Now the autonomous prefecture has newly established a middle school that can accommodate more than 400 students, and there are more than 14,000 primary school students. In 1954, more than 1,700 students graduated from primary schools in the entire autonomous prefecture, and more than 100 students graduated from middle schools this year; more than 300 Kirghiz youths are studying in schools in Beijing, Xi'an, Urumqi, Kashgar, and other places. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of farmers and herdsmen participate in literacy classes every year. In order to make school education adapt to the nomadic life of the pastoral areas, tent schools have been experimentally established in Uqturpan and other counties. Herdsmen originally could only study for five months a year, but now they can study for eight or nine months like schools in agricultural areas.

The Kirghiz language has been successfully researched, and cadres of all ethnic groups and Kirghiz herdsmen are actively learning the Kirghiz language.

Since the establishment of the autonomous prefecture, emphasis has been placed on cultivating and promoting local ethnic minority cadres. Kirghiz cadres account for 31 percent of the total number of cadres in the entire autonomous prefecture. The leading staff of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, People's Court, cooperative trade organizations, and public security departments are mostly cultivated from the Kirghiz people. After being tempered in various social reform movements, and under the Party's cultivation and education and the patient assistance of Han cadres, Kirghiz cadres have grown rapidly.

    克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州在前进
    天南
    八月，正是农牧业丰收的时期，我来到了新疆克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州的首府阿图什。这是一个年轻而又美丽的城市。这里，到处都在修建新的建筑物。最近完工的有自治州人民委员会、中共克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州地方委员会、人民银行、贸易公司、邮电局、中学等单位的办公室和校舍。目前还有大批修建工程，包括文化馆、公园和电影院，也正在施工和准备施工。
    这个六年前还被人叫作荒凉戈壁滩的地区，在很短时期内就出现了新的面貌，这是过去人们想也想不到的事情。自治州成立一年多来，各方面的建设事业都获得很大的成就。这是在共产党民族政策的光辉照耀下少数民族地区建设事业得到迅速发展的一个生动的例子。
    自治州是南疆的主要牧区。刚解放时，这里的畜牧业生产由于长期遭受反动统治者的残酷掠夺，已陷于破产。主要牧业县——乌恰县在一九四九年只有小畜两万头，大畜九千头。解放后，党和政府从各方面帮助和扶持牧民发展畜牧业生产。今年上半年统计，全县小畜已增加到二十一万五千多头，大畜有两万八千多头。政府在牧区建立了国营贸易机构，开辟了畜产品的销路。一九五四年国营贸易公司收购的畜产品比一九五三年增加了百分之六十六，其中单是羊毛一项就超过两百吨；给牧民供应的生产、生活资料比一九五三年增加百分之五十五。各供销合作社也大力收购畜产品和供应物资。现在全自治州有基层供销合作社十一处，贸易商店八处，巡回流动推销组二十二个，农具和土产品加工场二十二处。
    自治州的农业生产也在突飞猛进地发展。互助合作运动在农业区广泛开展以后，各种作物的单位面积产量不断提高，农民都亲眼看到了组织起来的好处，参加农业社和互助组已形成热潮。光阿图什一县，组织起来的农户即占全县总农户的百分之三十六以上。
    解放以后，阿图什、阿合奇、乌恰等县先后建立了人民卫生院。农牧民有了病，再不需要远道跋涉到喀什去治疗了。在旧社会，农民、牧民子弟是没有受教育权利的。现在自治州新建立了一所能容纳四百多个学生的中学，小学生有一万四千多人。一九五四年，全自治州有一千七百多个学生从小学毕业，今年有一百多个学生从中学毕业；还有三百多个柯尔克孜族青年正在北京、西安、乌鲁木齐、喀什等地的学校学习。同时，每年还有成千上万的农民、牧民参加识字班。为了使学校教育能适应牧区的游牧生活，在乌恰等县试办了帐篷小学。牧民原来一年只能学习五个月，现在能像农业区学校一样学习八、九个月。
    柯尔克孜族文字，已经研究成功，各族干部和柯族牧民正在积极学习柯尔克孜族文字。
    自治州成立以后，重视了培养和提拔本地民族干部。全自治州柯尔克孜族干部占干部总数的百分之三十一。自治州人民委员会、人民法院、合作贸易机构、公安部门的领导工作人员，大多是由柯尔克孜族人民中培养出来的。柯族干部经过各项社会改革运动的锻炼，在党的培养教育和汉族干部的耐心帮助下，成长得很快。
