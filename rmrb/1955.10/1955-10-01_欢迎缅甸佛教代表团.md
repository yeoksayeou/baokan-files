    Just as the people of the entire nation are joyfully celebrating the sixth anniversary of the founding of our country, the arrival of the Burmese Buddhist Delegation in our capital, Beijing, fills me with particular pleasure and excitement.

    This spring, I participated in the Chinese Buddhist Delegation’s friendly visit to Burma for a month. We visited eleven cities, including Rangoon and Mandalay, paid homage to various sacred sites, visited many famous temples, and exchanged views on Buddhist doctrines and the cause of defending peace. Through the delegation's visit, we expressed the profound friendship of Chinese Buddhists towards the people and Buddhists of Burma. The delegation was warmly received by the Burmese people and Buddhists. I still vividly remember the Venerable Monin, a man of divine appearance and clear spirit, over eighty-three years old, who said when he received the prayer beads we presented to him: "I will use them to recite Buddha's name every day. When I see them, it will be as if I am seeing my Chinese Buddhist friends." I also cannot forget the ancient city of Pagan, which can be called a "sea of pagodas," where we saw thousands of pagodas built hundreds of years ago, preserved to this day, including Chinese-style pagodas and Buddha statues, embodying the long history of friendly exchanges between the people and Buddhists of China and Burma. In Rangoon, we paid our respects to the bronze statue of Venerable U Wisara, who died of starvation in prison in 1930 after being arrested and imprisoned by colonialists for opposing colonial oppression. During the visit, the many kind and moving expressions of friendship from Burmese Buddhists and people from all walks of life, as well as their desire for peace, left a deep impression on me.

    Now, following our Buddhist delegation's visit to Burma, the Burmese Buddhist Delegation has also come to our country. We are very happy about the visit of the Burmese Buddhist Delegation and extend our warm welcome. During their visit to our country, the Burmese Buddhist Delegation will receive a warm and friendly reception from Chinese Buddhists. They will see that Chinese Buddhists are living a happy religious life under the religious freedom policy of the People's Government; they will see that Chinese Buddhists are working actively with the people of the whole country to devote themselves to the great cause of building the motherland and defending world peace.

    The people of China and Burma have a long and profound friendship. The exchanges between Buddhists of the two countries have a history of more than a thousand years. As early as the historical records of our Tang Dynasty, there were records of Buddhism in Burma. In the six years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the friendship between the people of the two countries has been further strengthened and deepened. Now, we feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to meet, interact, and learn from the Burmese Buddhist Delegation. I firmly believe that the mutual visits of the Buddhist delegations of the two countries will definitely make a positive contribution to strengthening the friendship between the people and Buddhists of the two countries and to the cause of defending world peace.

    I wish: Sino-Burmese friendship, world peace!

    欢迎缅甸佛教代表团
    中国佛教协会理事
    中国佛教访缅代表团团员     义方
    正当全国人民欢欣鼓舞地迎接六周年国庆的前夕，缅甸佛教代表团到达了我国首都——北京，使我倍觉愉快和兴奋。
    今年春季，我曾参加中国佛教访缅代表团在缅甸进行了一个月的友好访问。我们先后访问了仰光、曼德勒等十一个城市，朝礼了各处圣迹，参观了许多著名的寺院，访问了高僧长老，并就有关佛教教义及保卫和平事业的问题交换了意见。通过代表团的访问，我们表达了中国佛教徒对缅甸人民和佛教徒的深厚友谊。代表团受到了缅甸人民和佛教徒的热忱接待。我还清晰地记得那位貌古神清、年逾八十三岁的摩宁长老，当他接受我们赠送给他的念珠时说：“我每天要用它念佛，看到它，就如同看到你们中国的佛教朋友一样。”我也不能忘记那个堪称为“塔海”的蒲甘古城，在那里我们看到了保存到现在的远在数百年前兴建的千百座宝塔，其中还有中国形式的佛塔和佛像，体现了中缅两国人民和佛教徒之间悠久的友好往来的历史。我们在仰光瞻仰了一九三○年因反对殖民主义的压迫而被殖民主义者逮捕入狱绝食而死的宇维萨耶法师的铜像。在访问期间，缅甸佛教徒和各界对我们的许多亲切、动人的友好表示以及他们爱好和平的愿望，给我以极深的印象。
    现在，继我国佛教代表团访缅之后，缅甸佛教代表团也来到我国。我们对于缅甸佛教代表团的来访，感到十分欢喜，并表示热烈欢迎。缅甸佛教代表团在访问我国期间，将受到我国佛教徒热忱、友好的接待。他们将看到我国佛教徒在人民政府的宗教信仰自由政策下，过着愉快的宗教生活；他们将看到我国佛教徒正在同全国人民一道，积极致力于建设祖国和保卫世界和平的伟大事业。
    中缅两国人民有着悠久的、深厚的友谊。两国佛教徒的交往已有一千多年的历史。远在我国唐代的史书上就记载有缅甸佛教的情况。中华人民共和国成立六年来，两国人民的友谊更加加强和密切起来。现在，我们有此因缘能同缅甸佛教代表团相见，互相接触，互相学习，感到十分珍贵。我深信：通过两国佛教代表团的相互访问，定能对加强两国人民和佛教徒的友谊与保卫世界和平的事业作出积极的贡献。
    祝愿：中缅友好，世界和平！
