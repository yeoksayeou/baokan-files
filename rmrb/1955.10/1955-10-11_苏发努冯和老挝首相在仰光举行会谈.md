    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, October 10th: Talks between the Lao Royal Government delegation headed by Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith and the Lao Fighting Units delegation headed by Prince Souphanouvong began in Rangoon on October 9th.
    The talks will last for two days and will discuss urgent political issues in Laos, mainly the issue of holding general elections in Laos.
    Personnel from the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Laos have also arrived in Rangoon. These talks are being held at the initiative of the International Commission.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 10th: According to Vietnam News Agency: Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Units, stated upon arriving in Rangoon on the 8th: I sincerely thank the Government of the Union of Burma for agreeing to have Rangoon as the venue for the meeting between the representatives of the Lao Fighting Units and the representatives of the Lao Royal Government, in order to exchange views on correctly resolving the political issues of Laos in accordance with the Geneva Accords. This is a concrete manifestation of the friendship between the peoples of Laos and Burma, and it also proves the Burmese government's enthusiasm for the cause of peace in Asia.
    I hope that with the efforts of both parties and in a spirit of mutual understanding, the meeting between myself and Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith will yield good results.
