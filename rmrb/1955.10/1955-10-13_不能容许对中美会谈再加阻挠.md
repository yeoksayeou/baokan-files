    No Further Obstruction of Sino-US Talks Should Be Tolerated

    American news agencies have recently repeatedly reported that U.S. Ambassador Johnson raised the issue of "missing American soldiers" during the Korean War at the Sino-US talks. The reports also stated that Ambassador Johnson made this issue a major point under the second item on the agenda of the talks.

    People cannot help but feel very strange about these news reports. As everyone knows, at the beginning of the Sino-US talks, both sides reached an agreement that neither side would individually publicize the details of the talks. However, American news agencies are now publicizing information that has never been mentioned in the mutually agreed-upon news releases about the talks. This cannot but raise the question: Is the U.S. side willing to abide by the bilateral agreement on not individually publicizing the details of the talks?

    What is even more surprising is how the issue of missing American soldiers in the Korean War could be brought up at the Sino-US talks.

    As everyone knows, after the Korean armistice, the U.S. side raised the list of missing American soldiers in the Korean War at the Korean Military Armistice Commission to inquire with the Korean-Chinese side. The Korean-Chinese side formally replied to the U.S. side as early as September 1953, stating that some of those on the list provided by the U.S. side had already been repatriated to the U.S. side, some had been notified to the U.S. side as having been released, escaped, or died during the war, and the majority had never been captured or accommodated by the Korean-Chinese side. Therefore, the U.S. side's so-called "issue of missing American soldiers" has already been answered by the appropriate institutions in Korea; so, what reason is there to bring up this issue at the Sino-US talks now?

    There are indeed such people in the United States who fear the easing of tensions between China and the United States, and they use all despicable means to create tensions between China and the United States. They fabricate out of thin air that some American soldiers missing in the Korean War are now in China. This fabrication has no factual basis, and the purpose of raising this fabrication is known to all. However, the Sino-US talks should strive to ease the tension between China and the United States; what does raising such a question in the Sino-US talks have in common with the effort to ease the tension between China and the United States?

    If the issue of military personnel in the Korean War is to be discussed in the Sino-US talks, then the Chinese side has ample reason to raise the issue of the more than 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war forcibly detained by the United States. After the Korean armistice, the United States violated the armistice agreement, disregarded the clear resolution of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission chaired by India, forcibly detained more than 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, and sent them to the Chiang Kai-shek group to serve as cannon fodder. The U.S. side has not yet provided any explanation for this blatant violation of the armistice agreement.

    This is not the first time that the U.S. side has violated the bilateral agreement on news releases during the Sino-US talks. Everyone remembers that when an agreement was reached on the issue of civilians returning home and the talks should have entered the second item on the agenda for discussion, the U.S. side also disclosed the dispute in the talks without authorization, claiming that it was premature to discuss other issues before the agreement on the return of civilians was fulfilled. Because this statement was too absurd, the U.S. side obviously could not completely refuse to discuss the second item on the agenda. However, the U.S. side then fabricated the so-called issue of American soldiers missing in the Korean War. This cannot but raise a more serious question: Is the U.S. side willing to see the Sino-US talks make progress?

    The Chinese side has already proposed that the Sino-US talks should discuss the "embargo issue" and the "issue of preparing for higher-level Sino-US talks." These issues are obviously the practical problems that the Sino-US talks should solve in order to ease the tension between China and the United States. In order to ease the tension between China and the United States, the Chinese side has consistently adopted a positive attitude, but people have reason to demand that the U.S. side should not further obstruct the progress of the talks.

### 不能容许对中美会谈再加阻挠

    不能容许对中美会谈再加阻挠
    美国通讯社最近一再报道说，美国大使约翰逊在中美会谈中提出了朝鲜战争期间“失踪的美国军人问题”。报道还说，约翰逊大使把这一问题作为会谈第二项议程下的一个主要问题。
    对于这些新闻报道，人们不能不感觉到十分奇怪。大家知道，在中美会谈一开始的时候，双方就达成协议，各方不单独对外公布会谈的情况。但是，美国的通讯社现在却公布了双方协议发表的会谈消息中所从来没有提到过的情况。这就不能不引起这样的一个问题：美方究竟是否愿意遵守会谈中关于不单独公布会谈情况的双方协议？
    令人更其感到奇怪的是：朝鲜战争中失踪的美国军人问题如何能够提到中美会谈上来？
    大家知道，美国方面在朝鲜停战以后，曾经在朝鲜军事停战委员会上提出了朝鲜战争中失踪的美国军人的名单，向朝中方面查询。朝中方面早已在一九五三年九月正式答复美方，美方交来名单中一部分已经遣返给美方，一部分已经通知过美方是在战争期间释放、逃亡或死亡的，而大部分则从来没有被朝中方面所俘获收容。因此，美方所谓“失踪的美国军人问题”早已在朝鲜的适当机构得到了答复；那么，现在又有什么理由把这个问题提到中美会谈上来呢？
    在美国的确有这样一种人，他们唯恐中美紧张局势的和缓，他们用尽一切卑鄙的手段来制造中美间的紧张局势。他们凭空捏造说，有些在朝鲜战争中失踪的美国军人现在在中国。这种捏造是没有任何事实根据的，提出这种捏造的目的也是路人皆知的。但是，中美会谈是应该为和缓中美紧张局势而努力的；在中美会谈中提出这样的问题同和缓中美紧张局势的努力有什么相同之处呢？
    如果在中美会谈中要讨论朝鲜战争中的军事人员问题的话，那么，中国方面倒是有充分的理由提出被美国强迫扣留的一万四千余名中国人民志愿军被俘人员的问题。朝鲜停战后，美国违反停战协定，不顾以印度为主席的中立国遣返委员会的明确决议，强迫扣留了一万四千余名中国人民志愿军被俘人员，把他们送交给蒋介石集团充当炮灰。对于这种公然违反停战协定的行为，美国方面至今还没有作出任何交代。
    在中美会谈中美方违反双方关于发布新闻的协议，这已经不是第一次了。大家记得，在双方平民回国问题达成协议、会谈应该进入第二项议程讨论的时候，美国方面也曾经擅自对外透露会谈中的争论情况，声称在双方平民回国协议履行以前，讨论其他问题未免为时过早。由于这种说法太不像话了，美国方面显然已不可能完全拒绝讨论第二项议程。但是，美国方面却又无中生有地提出了所谓在朝鲜战争中失踪的美国军人问题。这就不能不引起一个更加严重的问题：美国方面究竟愿意不愿意使中美会谈获得进展？
    中国方面早已提出，中美会谈应该对“禁运问题”和“准备高一级的中美谈判问题”进行讨论。这些问题显然是中美会谈为和缓中美紧张局势所应予解决的实际问题。为了缓和中美之间的紧张局势，中国方面是一贯采取积极态度的，但是人们有理由要求，美国方面不应该对会谈的进展再加阻挠。
