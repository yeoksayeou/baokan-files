"Al-Ahram" wrote that Said Ghazzi told reporters after meeting with Nasser that the Syrian government and people fully support Egypt's policy of ensuring that the country obtains the necessary armaments.

Ghazzi said that Egypt has the legitimate right to be concerned about its armed forces, and that purchasing weapons is a country's internal affair. It is very natural that Syria supports Egypt's policies, which are beneficial to Egypt itself and to all Arab countries.

Faisal Saud came to Cairo to attend the Arab Foreign Ministers Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, October 9th: Indian newspapers support the recent agreement between Egypt and Czechoslovakia to exchange goods such as cotton and rice for armaments.

"Amrita Bazar Patrika" said that Egypt "is a sovereign and independent country, and it has every right to purchase the armaments it needs for its defense from any country it pleases."

The "Hindustan" on the 8th exposed the imperialists' attempt to blackmail Egypt, saying that they have lowered the price of Egyptian cotton on the world market in an attempt to create economic difficulties for Egypt.
