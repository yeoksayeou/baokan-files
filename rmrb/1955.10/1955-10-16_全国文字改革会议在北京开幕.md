    National Conference on Writing Reform Opens in Beijing

    (Our dispatch) The National Conference on Writing Reform opened in Beijing on the morning of October 15th. This conference was jointly convened by the Ministry of Education and the Chinese Writing Reform Committee. The tasks of the conference are to discuss and resolve two pressing issues: to adopt the draft plan for simplifying Chinese characters and to promote Mandarin Chinese, based on Beijing pronunciation, as the national common language.

    Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, delivered the opening speech. He said: The Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government are deeply concerned about and attach great importance to writing reform work. From 1952, the Chinese Writing Reform Research Committee was established under the Central Cultural and Educational Committee, and in December 1954, it was reorganized into the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, as an institution directly under the State Council. In January this year, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee and the Ministry of Education jointly released a draft plan for simplifying Chinese characters, launching discussions and collecting opinions throughout the country. In addition, the Ministry of Education has also done a lot of work in formulating commonly used characters and unifying pronunciation. But this is just a good start. He called on specialists, scholars, cultural and educational workers, and those enthusiastic about writing reform to unite closely, work actively, move forward steadily, and complete the arduous task of writing reform.

    Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered an important report to the conference.

    Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spoke at the conference on the topic of "Paving the Way for the Fundamental Reform of Chinese Characters." He made a scientific analysis of the development history and reform path of Chinese characters in particular.

    Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture, also spoke at the opening ceremony. He expressed the sincere support of the Ministry of Culture and national cultural and artistic workers for writing reform, and wished the conference a successful completion of its tasks.

    In the afternoon, a plenary session was held. Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, made a report entitled "Writing Must Be Reformed Under Certain Conditions"; Ye Gongchuo, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, made a report on the work of simplifying Chinese characters.
