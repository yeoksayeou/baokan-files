　　The Portuguese authorities in Macau once announced that they would hold a large-scale "celebration" in November to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Portugal's occupation of Macau. This news has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people.
    Macau is Chinese territory. The Chinese people have never forgotten Macau, nor have they forgotten their right to demand the return of this territory from Portugal. Indian Prime Minister Nehru also said in the Indian People's House on September 17 that "Of course, Macau will return to China, and there is no doubt about this." The fact that Macau has not yet been returned to China does not mean that the Chinese people will tolerate the continued occupation of Macau for a long time.
    The Portuguese authorities in Macau apparently mistake the Chinese people's peaceful policy for a sign of weakness. They arrogantly want to use the "celebration" of the 400th anniversary of the occupation of Macau to flaunt their colonialist status to the Chinese people, who have already thrown off the shackles of colonialism. This is something that the Chinese people will absolutely not tolerate.
    The provocative actions of the Portuguese authorities in Macau are not only a challenge to the Chinese people, but also a challenge to the Asian people.
    Faced with the growing anti-colonialist wave of the Asian people, the Portuguese colonialists stubbornly try to hold on to their colonies in Asia. The Portuguese authorities, disregarding the condemnation of the Indian people and broad world opinion, are trying to continue to maintain their colonial rule over Indian territories such as Goa, Daman, and Diu. Now the Portuguese authorities are trying to provoke the Chinese people with the "celebration" of the 400th anniversary of the occupation of Macau. These actions of the Portuguese authorities are not only an insult to the Chinese and Indian people, but also an insult to the Asian people. It can be asserted that no awakened Asian will tolerate this insult.
    We want to warn the Portuguese authorities in Macau: the China of today is not the China of six years ago, let alone the China of four hundred years ago. If the Portuguese authorities in Macau think that they can use China's peaceful policy to provoke the great Chinese people, then they are wrong. The Chinese people never allow provocateurs to succeed, and provocateurs will surely suffer the consequences of their actions.

### 警告澳门葡萄牙当局

    警告澳门葡萄牙当局
    澳门的葡萄牙当局一度宣布要在十一月份大规模“庆祝”葡萄牙侵占澳门四百周年纪念，这个消息引起了中国人民的极大愤慨。
    澳门是中国的领土。中国人民从来没有忘记澳门，也从来没有忘记他们有权利要求从葡萄牙手中收回自己的这块领土。印度尼赫鲁总理九月十七日在印度人民院也说过，“当然，澳门将归于中国，对于这一点是没有疑问的。”澳门至今还没有归还中国，并不等于说中国人民容忍澳门遭受侵占的情况长期继续下去。
    澳门葡萄牙当局显然是把中国人民的和平政策错误地看作软弱的表现，它狂妄地想以“庆祝”侵占澳门四百周年来向已经摆脱了殖民镣铐的中国人民炫耀它的殖民主义地位，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的事情。
    澳门葡萄牙当局的挑衅行动，不仅是对中国人民的挑战，同时也是对亚洲人民的挑战。
    葡萄牙的殖民主义者面对着亚洲人民的日益增涨的反殖民主义的浪潮，顽固地企图守住它在亚洲的殖民地。葡萄牙当局不顾印度人民和世界广大舆论的谴责，企图继续维持在果阿、达曼、第乌等印度领土上的殖民统治。现在葡萄牙当局又企图用“庆祝”侵占澳门四百周年的行动，来对中国人民进行挑衅。葡萄牙当局的这些行动，不但是对中国人民和印度人民的侮辱，而且也是对亚洲人民的侮辱。可以断言，没有一个觉醒了的亚洲人会容忍这种侮辱。
    我们要警告澳门的葡萄牙当局：现在的中国已经不是六年前的中国，更不是四百年前的中国。如果澳门葡萄牙当局以为可以利用中国的和平政策向伟大的中国人民进行挑衅，那它就错了。中国人民从来不容许挑衅者得逞，挑衅者必将自食其苦果。
