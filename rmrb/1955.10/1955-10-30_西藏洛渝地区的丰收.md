    A Bumper Harvest in the Loyu Region of Tibet
    Tian Wen
    In the southern part of the Tibetan Plateau, downstream of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, lies a region of steep mountains and narrow valleys. Here, at an altitude of 600 to over 2,000 meters above sea level, the climate is spring-like year-round, and it abounds in highland barley, wheat, rice, millet, cotton, sugarcane, bananas, mandarin oranges, watermelons, vegetables, and fruits. People call it "the Jiangnan of the Jiangnan on the Tibetan Plateau." This beautiful and fertile place is the "Loyu" region, which in Tibetan means "southern Tibet."

    This year, various crops in the Loyu region are growing better than in previous years. Generally, each rice panicle has seven branches and yields 350 grains; corn cobs are more than 20 centimeters long, and two cobs can produce one *sheng* (approximately 1.5 pounds) of corn; also, *manye* shaped like tiger hooves, foxtail millet-like grain spikes, as well as soybeans and sugarcane, are all growing particularly robust and large. People are saying: This is a rare year of bumper harvest!

    During the autumn harvest season, the Loyu region presents a joyous and busy scene everywhere. Just as dawn breaks, People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers and young farmers helping the masses with the harvest are already in the fields reaping crops. Joyful songs, one after another, spread from village to village:

    The black cloth-like forest has no edge;
    The golden grain cannot be harvested completely!

    Seeing this scene of bumper harvest, everyone cannot help but think of the PLA. When the PLA first arrived here, before the mud on their feet had dried, they picked up tools and started land reclamation and production; the soldiers also helped many farmers who had been wandering for years to repair and cultivate the dilapidated houses and barren land, and sent people to mobilize them to return home for production. Ten households in Hapu Village on the bank of the Yarlung Tsangpo River had all fled to other places, but after liberation, they all moved back to their hometown. This spring, the PLA lent more than 2,000 *jin* of grain produced by themselves to the farmers without interest. In addition, they distributed huge amounts of free agricultural tools and interest-free loans, and taught farmers many advanced production techniques. In Hapu Village, there was a poor old woman named Ciren. This spring, when her son passed away, only her daughter-in-law and two young grandsons were left in the family. Thinking about the difficulties of life in the future, she shed many tears. Later, the PLA lent her seeds and a small hoe and comforted her; several neighbors were moved and volunteered to help the old woman with her work. Now, the grain harvested by the old woman, including rice, wheat, corn, and *manye*, alone amounts to one hundred and five *kuang* (one *kuang* is more than one *dou*), enough for the whole year's consumption. Farmer Ciwang Gongbao learned about the benefits of deep plowing and careful cultivation from the PLA. This year, he plowed the land one more time and weeded one more time, and the crop yield increased by 20% compared with previous years.

    The farmers attribute this year's bumper harvest to the people sent by Chairman Mao. When PLA soldiers and staff members pass in front of their houses, they always enthusiastically invite the soldiers and staff members to come in and sit down, offer bananas, peaches, and sour wine to entertain them, and pull them together to sing and dance. They sing:

    The warm sun,
    Shines on our hometown;
    The crops are especially good this year,
    All because of Chairman Mao's kindness!

### 西藏洛渝地区的丰收

    西藏洛渝地区的丰收
    田文
    在西藏高原的南部，雅鲁藏布江的下游，有一片山陡谷狭的地区，这里拔海六百——两千多公尺，有着四季如春的气候，盛产青稞、小麦、大米、小米、棉花、甘蔗、香蕉、广柑、西瓜、菜蔬和水果。人们称它是“西藏高原江南的江南”。这个美丽富饶的地方就是“洛渝”地区，按藏话解释“洛渝”就是西藏南方的意思。
    今年洛渝地区各种农作物长得比往年好。一般一吊稻穗有七个杈，结三百五十粒籽；玉米棒有二十多公分长，两个棒子便可打一升玉米（一斤半）；还有虎蹄形的蔓加、狼尾巴似的谷穗以及黄豆、甘蔗，都长得特别结实和粗大。人们都说：这是难逢的丰收年成啊！
    秋收季节里，洛渝到处现出欢乐繁忙的景象。天刚曚曚亮，帮助群众收割的解放军战士和青年农民一起，已开始在田野间收割庄稼。欢乐的歌声，一个连一个，一村传一村：
    黑布样的森林没有边哟；
    金黄色的粮食收不完啊！
    看到这种丰收的景象，人人都禁不住想起了解放军。当解放军刚到这里的时候，脚上的泥巴还没有干，便拿起工具，开始开荒生产；战士们还帮助许多常年流浪在外的农民，把倒塌多年的房屋和荒芜的土地重新修盖和耕种起来，并派人去动员他们回家生产。雅鲁藏布江岸哈普村的十户农民，原来全都逃到异乡去了，解放后全搬回了家乡。今年春天，解放军把自己生产的两千多斤粮食，无利贷给农民，此外还发放了巨额无偿农具和无利贷款，教给农民许多先进的生产技术。在哈普村有个名叫次仁的贫苦老大妈，今年春天，当她儿子去世时，家里只剩下儿媳和两个小孙子，她想到今后生活的困难，不知流了多少次眼泪。后来解放军贷放给她种籽和小锄头，并且安慰了她；几户邻居受了感动，也自愿帮助大妈干活。现在，大妈收的粮食，仅稻谷、小麦、玉米和蔓加就有一百零五筐（一筐一斗多），足够全年食用。农民次旺共保从解放军那里知道了深耕细作的好处，今年多犁了一遍地，多锄了一次草，作物收获量较往年增加了两成。
    农民们把今年的丰收，都归功于毛主席派来的人。解放军战士和工作人员打从他们的家门前过时，他们总要热情地请战士和工作人员进房坐坐，端出香蕉、蜜桃和酸酒来招待，还拉着一起唱歌跳舞，他们唱道：
    温暖的太阳，
    照着我们家乡；
    今年庄稼特别好呵，
    都因毛主席的恩情长！
