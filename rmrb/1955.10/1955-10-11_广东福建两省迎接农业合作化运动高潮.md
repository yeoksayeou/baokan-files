Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 7th. Guangdong Province has convened county, district, and township level cadre meetings in approximately one hundred counties. The main content of the meetings was to discuss how to welcome the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement this autumn and next spring. Nearly 100,000 cadres participated in the meetings.

At the meetings, the cadres focused on studying Chairman Mao's instructions "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," and discussed the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China's plan for cooperation throughout the province. The meetings, based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, reviewed the development status of the local cooperative movement, and criticized the erroneous views and right-leaning thoughts of many cadres on the issue of cooperation in the past. Some counties also commended a group of outstanding cadres who actively led the establishment of cooperatives at these meetings.

After the meetings and discussions, the vast majority of cadres recognized the mainstream and essence of the current cooperative movement, and their confidence in running cooperatives greatly increased. After the three-level cadre meetings in various counties in the Eastern Guangdong region, the entire region plans to develop from the existing 3,000-plus agricultural production cooperatives to more than 22,300 cooperatives this autumn and next spring. Zhang Yongyi, a cadre in charge of establishing cooperatives in Daze Township, Xinhui County, originally had three fears about the work of establishing cooperatives: fear of a lack of cadres; fear that the old cooperatives would not be consolidated, making it difficult to establish new cooperatives; and fear that if too many cooperatives were established, there would be no way out for the labor force. After he attended the county's cadre meeting and improved his ideological understanding, the township's cooperative establishment plan was increased from the original nine cooperatives to thirteen cooperatives, and he expressed full confidence that he could complete it.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 9th. Leading organs at all levels in Fujian Province are actively preparing to welcome the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement. At present, the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and its local party committees and county party committees have successively convened expanded cadre meetings, earnestly studied the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on agricultural cooperation, summarized the experience of running cooperatives over the years, criticized the right-leaning thinking of "small steps and over-strict control" in the past, and, based on the actual situation, have initially formulated comprehensive plans for running cooperatives throughout the province, the special districts, and the counties. The province plans to have 65 percent of farmers join agricultural production cooperatives by 1957. This autumn and next spring, the province is required to develop from the existing 19,000-plus cooperatives to more than 38,000 cooperatives, with the number of households joining the cooperatives increasing from 15 percent to more than 35 percent of the total number of farm households. In the major forest areas such as Nanping and Jianyang, farm households joining agricultural, forestry, and agricultural-forestry combined production cooperatives will account for 38 to 46 percent of the total number of farm households in each region. In the Longxi Special District, a major grain-producing area and also a famous overseas Chinese area, the number of farm households joining cooperatives will also increase to 39 percent of the total number of farm households. At present, each county is selecting mutual aid team backbones and activists among the poor and single-handedly working farmers for short-term training, as the backbone for establishing cooperatives during the large-scale development of cooperatives this autumn. More than 90,000 rural work cadres and agricultural production cooperative work team members who have undergone short-term study and training throughout the province have now gone deep into the countryside to publicize the policies, guidelines, and methods for establishing cooperatives to the farmers, and to lead the farmers in each township to formulate comprehensive plans for agricultural cooperation in their respective townships.

    广东福建两省迎接农业合作化运动高潮
    新华社广州七日电　广东省约有一百个县已经召开了县、区、乡三级干部会议。会议主要内容是讨论如何迎接今秋明春的农业合作化运动高潮。参加会议的有近十万干部。
    在会议上，干部们着重学习了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的指示，并讨论了中共广东省委关于全省合作化的规划。会议根据毛主席指示精神检查了当地合作化运动的发展状况，并批判了许多干部过去对合作化问题的错误看法和右倾思想。有些县还在这次会议上表扬了一批积极领导办社的优秀干部。
    经过会议讨论后，绝大部分干部认清了当前合作化运动的主流和本质，办社信心大大提高。粤东区经过各县三级干部会议后，全区计划今秋明春由现有三千多个农业生产合作社发展到二万二千三百多个社。新会县大泽乡办社干部张永怡原来对办社工作有三怕：怕没有干部；怕老社不巩固，难办新社；怕多办了社，劳动力没有出路。在他参加了县的干部会议提高了思想认识后，这个乡的办社计划就由原来办九个社增加到十三个社，他满怀信心地表示一定可以完成。
    新华社福州九日电　福建省各级领导机关积极准备迎接农业合作化运动高潮。目前，中共福建省委员会和所属各地委、县委都已先后召开扩大干部会，认真学习了中共中央关于农业合作化指示，总结了历年来办社经验，批判了过去的“小手小脚、控制过严”的右倾思想，并根据实际情况，初步订出了全省、全专区、全县的办社的全面规划。全省计划到一九五七年有百分之六十五的农户加入农业生产合作社。在今秋明春，要求全省由现有的一万九千多个社发展到三万八千多个社，入社农户由占农户总数的百分之十五增加到百分之三十五以上。南平、建阳等主要林区加入农业、林业和农林业相结合的生产合作社的农户将占各地区农户总数百分之三十八到四十六。主要产粮区、也是著名的侨区龙溪专区入社农户也将增加到占农户总数百分之三十九。现在各县正分别抽调互助组骨干和贫苦的单干农民中的积极分子进行短期训练，作为今秋合作社大发展时的办社骨干。全省经过短期学习和训练的九万多名农村工作干部、农业生产合作社工作队队员，现已深入乡村，向农民宣传办社方针、政策和办法，并领导各乡农民制定本乡农业合作化全面的规划。
