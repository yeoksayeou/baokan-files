Telegram of Respect from the Tibetan Local Government to Chairman Mao and the State Council

To the great Chairman Mao Zedong and the State Council:

Under the unified leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the great leader Mao Zedong, and the Central People's Government, thanks to the support of the people of the whole country and the arduous struggles of the road-building troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, engineering and technical personnel, workers of all ethnic groups, and laborers against high mountains, turbulent rivers, precipitous cliffs, and steep rocks, the Kangzang and Qingzang highways were victoriously opened to traffic to Lhasa on December 25th last year. Not long after, the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways within the scope of the State Council's assistance to Tibet's construction were also completed in a very short period this year. From then on, the three major cities of Tibet have been connected by highways. This has once again made the Tibetan people rejoice and further strengthened the foundation for the development of Tibet's politics, economy, and culture. Furthermore, it has made transportation between the Han and Tibetan regions and within the Tibetan region more convenient. Therefore, cultural exchanges, unity, and mutual assistance between the Tibetan and fraternal ethnic groups, as well as within the Tibetan people, will undoubtedly be more consolidated than before. We firmly believe that you and the State Council are deeply concerned about increasing the happiness of minority ethnic groups, have helped us in the past, and will continue to help us for a long time to come. We will more sincerely unite with the People's Liberation Army in Tibet and working cadres, rely on the help of the Han people and staff, and work tirelessly for the construction of Tibet and the socialist cause of the motherland.

On the occasion of warmly celebrating the opening of the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to you on behalf of all the monks and lay people of Tibet.

    西藏地方政府向毛主席、国务院致敬电伟大的毛泽东主席并国务院：
    在中国共产党、伟大领袖毛泽东和中央人民政府统一领导下，由于全国人民的支援，由于中国人民解放军筑路部队、工程技术人员、各族工人和民工等不辞艰苦地同高山、激流、悬岩、峭壁进行顽强斗争的结果，去年十二月二十五日，康藏、青藏两条公路胜利通车拉萨。不久之后，在国务院帮助西藏建设事项内的拉（萨）日（喀则）和日（喀则）江（孜）两条公路又在今年一个很短时间内建成了。从此，西藏的三个大城市就被公路连接起来了。这又一次使西藏人民欢欣鼓舞，进一步加强了西藏政治、经济、文化各方面发展的基础。并且使汉族地区和藏族地区间以及西藏地区内部的交通更加便利，因此，藏族和兄弟民族间以及藏族内部的文化交流、团结互助，无疑地会比以前更加巩固起来。我们深信您和国务院在深切关怀着增进少数民族的幸福，过去帮助了我们，今后还会长期地继续帮助我们。我们要和进藏人民解放军、工作干部更加真诚地团结起来，依靠汉族人民和工作人员的帮助，为着建设西藏、建设祖国的社会主义事业而努力不懈。
    我们在热烈庆祝拉日、日江公路通车之际，谨代表西藏全体僧俗人民向您们致以衷心的感谢。
               西藏地方政府噶厦一九五五年十月十九日
                      藏历木羊年九月四日
