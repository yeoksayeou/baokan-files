    Guiding Farmers to Reasonably Use Funds
    Mou Lan
    The autumn harvest season has arrived. This year, the country has a bumper harvest of agricultural products, and farmers have a large amount of cash on hand after selling their produce. If this money is arranged properly, it can be used to expand production; if it is arranged improperly, it will cause great waste and affect next spring's production. Therefore, how to help farmers arrange and use this money is a major task in current rural economic work.
    In some cotton-producing areas of Shandong Province, the cotton harvest has been particularly good this year. After farmers sell the cotton to the state, many wasteful behaviors have occurred. Many cotton farmers in the suburbs of Dezhou often ride their bicycles to restaurants in the city for extravagant eating and drinking, which not only wastes money but also delays production. There is a saying among local cotton farmers: "Peaches (cotton bolls) never leave the legs, buns never leave the mouth." This means that when the cotton comes in, eating and drinking a little is nothing. The Party organizations and administrative departments, and mass organizations' staff in the countryside, should actively educate farmers and help them correct this behavior of not planning for the long term and wasting production funds.
    These wasteful phenomena mostly occur among individual farmers or new members who joined the cooperatives this year, especially among middle peasants. Because they do not clearly understand the policy of agricultural collectivization and are afraid of having to invest a lot of money after joining the cooperatives, making it difficult to use the money, they "spend the money as soon as it arrives and eat as soon as the food is available," spending a lot of money. They do not realize that spending a lot of money after the autumn harvest will leave them without money to buy means of production in the spring, and may even affect their lives.
    Such thoughts and emotions among farmers are obviously very detrimental to production. The financial and economic leading departments in various regions should actively lead the local agricultural production cooperatives and credit cooperatives to repeatedly and thoroughly publicize and explain the policies to farmers, dispel their concerns about exposing wealth and being unable to withdraw their investments after investing. By calculating detailed accounts, helping farmers plan production, and formulating production investment plans, in conjunction with the credit cooperatives' collection of overdue loans and cotton advance payments, they should also mobilize them to deposit their funds in the credit cooperatives to facilitate the planned arrangement and use of funds.
    Facts have proven that some agricultural production cooperatives, by reasonably arranging farmers' funds in conjunction with credit cooperatives, can guide farmers to invest in production and can appropriately improve their lives on the basis of developing and expanding production, according to the specific situation of income and expenditure. The Qianjin and Xinsheng production cooperatives in Songguantun Township, Fourth District of Dexian County, had a bumper cotton harvest this year. Because the leaders of the agricultural production cooperatives cooperated well with the credit cooperatives, more than 85% of the cotton sales proceeds have been used to repay agricultural loans, repay cotton advance payments, and make savings deposits. A large portion of this money will be used to expand production next spring, with a preliminary decision to invest approximately 40,000 yuan. After formulating the investment plan, they also plan to help farmers plan sideline production and arrange living expenses on the principle of thrift. This method of leading farmers to arrange the use of money in a planned way is worth promoting.

    领导农民合理使用资金
    牟澜
    秋收旺季已经到来，今年全国农产品丰收，农民在出售农产品后，有大笔现钱在手头。如果这些钱安排得当，就能使资金用于扩大生产；如果安排不当，就会造成很大的浪费，影响明春生产。因此，如何帮助农民安排使用这笔钱，是当前农村经济工作中的一件大事。
    山东省有些棉产区，今年棉花的收成特别好，农民把棉花卖给国家后，发生了很多浪费行为。德州郊区许多棉农，经常骑着自行车上城里饭馆大吃大喝，不但浪费了钱，还耽误了生产。当地棉农有一句谚语：“桃子（棉桃）不离腿、包子不离嘴。”意思就是棉花一下来，吃点喝点不算啥。对于这种不打长谱、浪费生产资金的行为，农村的党组织和行政部门、群众团体的工作人员，应该对农民积极进行教育，帮助他们改正。
    这些浪费现象大多发生在单干农户或今年才入社的新社员中，其中尤以中农为多。由于他们对农业合作化的政策认识不清，怕入社后要大量投资，用钱不易，于是就“钱到手、饭到嘴”，大量地花钱。他们没有想到，秋收后大量花费，到春耕的时候就会没钱购买生产资料，甚至可能影响生活。
    农民中有这样的思想情绪，显然是对生产十分不利的。各地财经领导部门应该积极领导各地的农业生产合作社和信用合作社，向农民反复深入地宣传，交代政策，解除农民怕露富、怕投资后没法取出来使用等顾虑。通过算细账、帮助农民打生产谱、订生产投资计划，结合信用合作社收回到期贷款和棉花预付定金，再动员他们把资金存入信用合作社，以便于有计划地安排使用资金。
    事实证明：有些农业生产合作社由于结合信用合作社合理安排了农民的资金，就能领导农民投资于生产，并能根据收支的具体情况，在发展和扩大生产的基础上，适当地改善生活。德县四区宋官屯乡前进、新生两生产合作社今年棉花大丰收，由于农业生产合作社的领导人员同信用合作社配合得好，已经有百分之八十五以上的售棉款用于归还农贷、归还棉花预付定金和储蓄存款。其中有很大一笔钱将用于扩大明春生产，初步决定投资数约四万元。他们在制定投资计划后，还准备在节约的原则下，帮助农民打谱搞副业生产、安排生活费用，这样有计划地领导农民安排用钱的办法，是值得推广的。
