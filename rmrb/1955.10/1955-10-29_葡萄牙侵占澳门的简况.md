    A brief history of Portugal's occupation of Macau
    I
    Macau has always been Chinese territory. It is located on a peninsula outside the Pearl River Estuary in Guangdong Province, China. In the late Ming Dynasty, it was a trading port under the jurisdiction of Xiangshan County (now Zhongshan County). Today, Macau commonly refers to the area including the islands of Taipa and Coloane near Macau, with a total area of 14 square kilometers and a population of over 130,000.
    In the early 16th century, after Portuguese feudal nobles and merchants occupied Malacca on the Malay Peninsula, they began to arrive on the southeast coast of China, demanding trade on one hand while engaging in piracy, harassing the area. They bribed officials, sold contraband, robbed ships and cargo, and even engaged in the slave trade. These acts of piracy were opposed by the Chinese people, and the Portuguese were expelled from the coasts of Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Fujian.
    In 1535 (the 14th year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty), Portuguese merchants began to arrive in Macau. By bribing local officials, they were able to dock ships at Macau's docks and conduct trade. At the same time, they continued to harass and plunder activities along the southeast coast.
    In 1553 (the 32nd year of Jiajing), Portuguese colonialists, under the pretext of sun-drying waterlogged goods on the shore of Macau, took the opportunity to go ashore and reside there. Later, the Portuguese expanded their residential areas, built city walls and forts, established their own officials, and harassed and plundered the people of the southeast coast. This is how Portugal began its occupation of Macau.
    II
    After the Opium War, the Portuguese colonialists' ambition to occupy Macau became even more rampant. In 1849, they expelled the Qing government officials and customs officers in Macau, and constantly harassed and occupied various places near Macau by force. In 1849, they attacked Wangxia Village in the northeast of the Macau Peninsula, in 1851 they attacked Taipa Island, in 1863 they attacked Shali and Shagang villages in the west of the peninsula, in 1864 they attacked Coloane Island in the south, and in 1879 they attacked Longtian Village in the east of the peninsula.
    In 1887 (the 13th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty), Portuguese colonialists signed the so-called Sino-Portuguese Treaty of 54 Articles with the Qing government, attempting to achieve their goal of "permanently residing and administering Macau." The Chinese people have firmly opposed and refused to recognize this traitorous treaty from the very beginning.
    In 1889, Portuguese colonialists further expanded their aggression and occupied Qingzhou in the northwest of the Macau Peninsula. Thus, the Macau Peninsula and the islands of Taipa and Coloane were all occupied by Portugal. Later, Portugal repeatedly invaded the mainland areas and islands of Dahengqin and Xiaohengqin near Macau, attempting to seize these areas, but failed due to the resistance of local residents. After the occupation, the people of Wangxia Village and other villages also organized armed forces to resist the Portuguese officials' collection of rent per household.
    In 1909 (the first year of Xuantong in the Qing Dynasty), the Qing government held a boundary demarcation conference with Portugal. Portugal took the opportunity to conspire to expand its aggression, demanding the expansion of Macau's territory. The people of Guangdong firmly opposed this move by Portugal and demanded the abolition of the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of 1887, so the conference did not yield any results.
    However, Portugal's ambition to expand its aggression did not end. Even during the Anti-Japanese War, it continued to invade areas near Macau, attempting to expand its area of aggression.
    After the founding of New China, Portugal even repeatedly provoked near the Guan閘 (Border Gate), especially in July 1952, when it launched an armed attack. After we resolutely counterattacked the Portuguese provocateurs, Portugal had to apologize and pay compensation.
    III
    After the Indian people put forward the demand to recover Goa, the Portuguese colonialists, disregarding the condemnation of world public opinion, refused to return Goa to the Indian people. At the same time, in order to consolidate the colonial status of Macau, they illegally changed our Macau territory, which they had illegally occupied, into the Portuguese "Province of Macau" and promulgated the so-called "Organic Law of Overseas Province of Macau" in July 1955. Recently, they even actively planned the so-called "400th Anniversary of the Opening of the Port," attempting to flaunt its sinful history of occupying Macau for hundreds of years. This is clearly a challenge to the Chinese people, and also a challenge to the Asian people. The Chinese people naturally feel great indignation.
    Macau is Chinese territory. The Chinese people have never forgotten Macau, and the compatriots in Macau have never forgotten the great motherland. In the six years since the founding of New China, Macau compatriots have held grand celebrations every National Day. On October 1st this year, in order to give a strong response to Portugal's so-called "400th Anniversary of the Opening of the Port," the compatriots in Macau held even grander National Day celebrations than in previous years. They are proud of the growing strength of the motherland. In order to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their motherland, the Chinese people will never tolerate the long-term continuation of the situation in which Macau is occupied.

    葡萄牙侵占澳门的简况
    一
    澳门历来就是中国的领土。它位于我国广东省珠江口外的一个半岛上，在明朝后期是一个贸易港，属香山县（即今中山县）管辖。今天通称的澳门，还包括澳门附近的凼仔、路环两岛，三处面积共十四平方公里，人口约十三万余人。
    在十六世纪初，葡萄牙的封建贵族和商人侵占了马来亚半岛的麻六甲后，便开始来到中国东南沿海，一面要求通商贸易，一面却从事他们的海盗事业，到处进行骚扰。他们贿赂官吏，贩卖违禁物品，抢劫船只和货物，甚至贩卖人口。这种海盗行为遭到了中国人民的反对，因此葡萄牙人先后从广东、浙江、福建沿海被驱逐出去。
    一五三五年（明嘉靖十四年），葡萄牙商人开始来到澳门，由于贿赂地方官吏，得以在澳门码头停泊船舶，进行贸易。同时他们却在东南沿海继续进行骚扰劫掠活动。
    一五五三年（嘉靖三十二年），葡萄牙殖民主义者借口要到澳门岸上曝晒水浸货物，乘机上岸居住，可是后来，葡萄牙人却得寸进尺地扩大居住地区，建筑城墙、炮台，自设官吏，并且骚扰劫掠东南沿海人民。葡萄牙就是这样开始了侵占澳门的行动。
    二
    鸦片战争以后，葡萄牙殖民主义者侵占澳门的野心就更加猖獗起来。他们在一八四九年驱逐了满清政府在澳门的官吏和海关人员，并且不断四出骚扰，用武力侵占了澳门附近各地，在一八四九年进攻澳门半岛东北的望厦村，一八五一年进攻凼仔岛，一八六三年进攻半岛西方的沙梨头、沙岗等村，一八六四年进攻南面的路环岛，一八七九年进攻半岛正东的龙田村。
    一八八七年（清光绪十三年），葡萄牙殖民主义者同满清政府签订了所谓中葡条约五十四款，企图达到它“永驻管理澳门”的目的。对这个卖国条约，中国人民从一开始就是坚决反对和不承认的。
    一八八九年葡萄牙殖民主义者进一步扩大侵略，占领了澳门半岛西北的青州。这样，澳门半岛和凼仔、路环二岛就全被葡萄牙占领。后来葡萄牙还多次侵入澳门附近的大陆地区和大小横琴岛，企图霸占这些地区，但是由于当地居民的抵抗，没有得逞。望厦村等各村人民在葡萄牙占领后也曾组织武装力量，反抗葡萄牙官吏按户收租。
    一九○九年（清宣统元年）满清政府与葡萄牙举行勘界会议，葡萄牙乘机阴谋扩大侵略，要求扩大澳门属地，广东人民坚决反对葡萄牙这一举动，并且要求废除一八八七年的中葡条约，于是会议没有得到结果。
    但是葡萄牙的扩大侵略的野心并未终止，直到抗日战争期间，还不断侵入澳门附近地区，企图扩大侵略地区。
    新中国成立后，葡萄牙竟还曾屡次在关闸附近进行挑衅，特别在一九五二年七月更发动武装袭击，在我给葡萄牙挑衅者以坚决的反击之后，葡萄牙不得不道歉赔款了事。
    三
    在印度人民提出了收回果阿的要求以后，葡萄牙殖民主义者不顾全世界舆论的谴责，拒绝将果阿交还印度人民；同时，为了企图巩固澳门的殖民地位，他们竟将它非法侵占的我澳门领土改为葡萄牙的“澳门省”，并于一九五五年七月颁布了所谓“澳门海外省组织法”。最近他们更一度积极筹划所谓“开埠四百周年纪念”，企图炫耀它侵占澳门数百年来的罪恶历史。这显然是一种对中国人民的挑战，同时也是对亚洲人民的挑战，中国人民自然感到极大愤恨。
    澳门是中国的领土。中国人民从来没有忘记澳门，澳门同胞也从来没有忘记伟大的祖国。新中国成立六年来，每逢国庆，澳门同胞都有盛大的庆祝活动。今年十月一日澳门同胞为了给葡萄牙的所谓“开埠四百周年纪念”以有力的回答，举行了比往年更加盛大的国庆纪念，他们为祖国的日益强大而感到自豪。中国人民为了维护自己祖国的主权和领土完整，决不能容忍澳门遭受侵占的情况长期继续下去。（新华社）
