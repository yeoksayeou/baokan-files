The Soviet comrades said, "The Urals, this is a golden region." Touring this area, which is no smaller than a major European country, passing through mineral-rich mountains, rivers with powerful water resources, endless grasslands where spring wheat grows, and inexhaustible forests, you can see that the Urals is indeed a golden region. Here, limitless resources are combined. Here, the rational distribution of industry illustrates the planned development of the Soviet national economy. Here, large-scale industrial production using advanced technology demonstrates the high level of Soviet industrialization, the prosperity of the Soviet Union, and the material basis for the Soviet Union's smooth construction of a communist society. All of these are the victory fruits of the Soviet socialist industrialization policy.

The main resources of the Urals are mineral deposits. Among the minerals, metals are the most abundant, and among the metals, iron and copper are the most plentiful. The entire Ural Mountains are distributed with iron and copper deposits. In the early 18th century, during the time of Peter the Great, Russia began to establish mining and metallurgical enterprises in the Urals. It was not until the 1890s that newer mining and metallurgical enterprises that arose in Ukraine surpassed it. However, the Tsarist system and outdated technology were unable to fully utilize the resources of the Urals. Only the emergence of the socialist system made it possible for the Urals to become a golden region in the hands of the people. However, it was not easy to bring the role of the Urals into play. During the Soviet Civil War, the mining and metallurgical enterprises in the Urals were severely damaged by the Kolchak White bandits. Later, these old enterprises were restored. But the Ural deposits had one unfortunate shortcoming: plenty of lignite but a lack of coal for smelting steel. Still using charcoal to produce pig iron, annual production could not exceed one million tons, which could not meet the needs of developing industry in the east and laying railways.

However, the Urals has not only superior conditions and necessity for developing the mining and metallurgical industry but also for the overall heavy industry. First, the deposits of iron, copper, rare metals, chemical raw materials, etc., are diverse and abundant in the Urals. Second, the Urals is far from the border, which is particularly suitable for establishing heavy industry from a national defense point of view. Third, the Urals is located between the European part of the Soviet Union and the east, and is the hub for developing Siberia, Kazakhstan, and the entire eastern economy of the Soviet Union. Fourth, the Urals had established hundreds of small mining and metallurgical enterprises over two hundred years, so it retained a skilled workforce and accumulated a lot of production experience.

The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party wisely assessed all of this and decided to establish the Ural-Kuzbass coal-iron combined base, grasping this central link to solve the overall development of Ural industry and the entire eastern economic problem. Using Kuzbass coal to smelt Ural iron guaranteed the development of the steel industry in the Urals and Siberia. On this basis, a complete set of heavy industries was established in the Urals: mining, metallurgy, machine manufacturing, chemical, timber, and electricity. Besides the Ukrainian coal and iron center, the establishment of the second coal and iron center in the Urals and Kuzbass accelerated the socialist industrialization of the Soviet Union.

The Urals became a modern, comprehensively developed heavy industrial area starting from the first Five-Year Plan period of the Soviet Union. During this period, one hundred and forty-nine large enterprises were established in the Urals and fully or partially put into operation, and eighty large enterprises began construction and nearly one hundred enterprises were renovated. The Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine, the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, and the Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, etc., were all established during this period. The output of large industries in the Urals increased by about two and a half times from 1927-1928 to 1932. During the second Five-Year Plan period, the scale of industrial construction in the Urals was even larger. 21.2 percent of the construction funds of the entire Soviet Union were invested in the Urals heavy industry. Due to the large-scale construction focusing on the development of machine manufacturing, the Urals changed from a coal mining and metallurgy area to one of the largest industrial areas in the Soviet Union mainly engaged in machine manufacturing. In the first three years of the third Five-Year Plan, the output of pig iron and steel in the Urals had reached nearly one-fifth of the total output of the Soviet Union, chemicals were one-fifth, the output of copper, nickel, aluminum, and magnesium ranked first in the Soviet Union, petroleum ranked second, electricity ranked third, and machine manufacturing ranked fourth. The Urals industry is mainly heavy industry, and light industry and food industry only supply the living needs of the Ural residents.

The Urals had already been industrialized in the pre-war Five-Year Plan periods. The industrialized Urals is an example of the Soviet Union's implementation of the principle of rational industrial distribution. This distribution principle requires: developing the country's resources, the multi-faceted development of various regions, promoting economically underdeveloped regions, bringing industry closer to raw material production areas and consumer areas, and strengthening national defense forces. Before the start of the first Five-Year Plan, Soviet industry was concentrated in Moscow, Leningrad, and Ukraine. The establishment of the Urals industrial area made it unnecessary to transport many industrial products from the west to the east from afar. The Urals uses its own production of steel, high-grade steel, copper, machines, petroleum, chemicals, timber, etc., to connect with all regions of the country, especially the east, supporting the development of industry, agriculture, and transportation in the eastern regions. The various industries in the Urals, established based on local resources, are also interconnected and mutually guaranteed. For example: In Nizhny Tagil, I saw the largest Ural Wagon Manufacturing Plant in the Soviet Union. The production of this factory is mechanized, assembly line operated, and large-scale. The factory had already completed the fifth Five-Year Plan in 1954 in terms of increasing labor productivity. It produces wagons, and the New Tagil Steel Plant produces steel rails, which guarantee the development of railway transportation in the east. The rail rolling mill of the New Tagil Steel Plant is supplied by the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant, which in turn obtains steel from steel plants such as Magnitogorsk. The Urals has established many powerful thermal power plants, which transmit the electricity generated by using local coal to the unified power grid of the Urals, which is then uniformly distributed by the dispatcher of the power grid according to the needs of various industrial enterprises. From here, we can see the planning nature of industrial production in the Urals.

The role of the Urals industrial area in national defense was fully proven during the Soviet Patriotic War. During this period, the Urals became a powerful arsenal of the Soviet Union, and its products accounted for 40 percent of the country's military industrial products. The Urals industrial area developed greatly during the war. The industrial products of Sverdlovsk, the largest industrial center in the Urals, increased sevenfold from 1940 to 1944, and many new industrial centers emerged. The proportion of machine manufacturing in industry increased from 42.7 percent in 1940 to 70 percent in 1943. The manufacturing of machine tools, motors, and instruments was particularly developed.

After the war, the industry in the Urals continued to move forward. In 1954, the industrial products produced in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union (the Urals, the Volga region, Siberia, the Far East, Kazakhstan, and the Central Asian republics) accounted for one-third of the total industrial output of the Soviet Union, steel and steel products accounted for more than half, coal accounted for half, petroleum accounted for more than 60 percent, and electricity accounted for more than 40 percent. The total industrial output of the entire Soviet Union in 1954 was 2.8 times that of 1940, while the eastern regions of the Soviet Union in 1954 was four times that of 1940.

The workers of the Urals are striving to overfulfill the fifth Five-Year Plan through socialist competition. Ural industrial enterprises are further and extensively applying new achievements in science and technology and advanced production experience to strengthen specialization and collaboration.

The Soviet Communist Party teaches the Soviet people that they must surpass the major capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in order to obtain abundant products and transition from the first stage of communism to the second stage. Therefore, although the Ural industry is so developed, people are not complacent about it. Not satisfied with the victory fruits already obtained, and continuing to improve the level of industry on the basis of high industrialization - this is the characteristic of the Urals.

    社会主义工业化政策的胜利果实
    ——乌拉尔纪行
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    苏联同志说：“乌拉尔，这是黄金的地区。”在这个幅员不下欧洲一个大国的地方巡回一下，经过矿产丰富的山岭，水力强大的河流，生长春麦的一望无垠的草原，木材取之不尽的森林，你可以看到乌拉尔果然是黄金的地区。在这里，无限的富源都结合在一起了。在这里，工业的合理分布，说明了苏联国民经济的有计划发展的特征。在这里，以高度技术进行的大规模的工业生产，显示了苏联的高度工业化，苏联的富强和苏联顺利地建设共产主义社会的物质基础。所有这些都是苏联社会主义工业化政策胜利的果实。
    乌拉尔的主要富源是矿藏。矿藏当中金属最广，金属当中铁和铜最多。整个乌拉尔山脉都分布有铁矿铜矿。在十八世纪初年彼得一世时代，俄国开始在乌拉尔建立了采矿冶金企业。直到十九世纪九十年代在乌克兰兴起的较新的采矿冶金企业才赶过了它。但是沙皇制度和陈旧的技术，没有办法充分使用乌拉尔的富源。只有社会主义制度的出现，才使乌拉尔有可能成为人民手里的黄金地区，然而要发挥乌拉尔的作用，并不是很容易的。在苏联国内战争时期，乌拉尔的采矿冶金企业，受到了高尔察克白匪的严重破坏。后来这些陈旧的企业恢复了。但是乌拉尔矿藏有一个美中不足的缺点：褐煤很多而缺少冶炼钢铁用的煤。仍旧用木炭炼生铁，一年产量不能超过一百万吨，那是不能满足在东部发展工业和铺设铁路的需要的。
    可是，乌拉尔具有不但是发展采矿冶金工业而且是全盘重工业的优越条件和必要性。第一，铁、铜、稀有金属、化学原料等等矿藏在乌拉尔是多样而且丰富的。第二，乌拉尔远离边界，从国防观点说来，特别适宜于建立重工业。第三，乌拉尔处在苏联欧洲部分和东部之间，是发展西伯利亚、哈萨克斯坦和苏联整个东部经济的枢纽。第四，乌拉尔在二百年间建立过好几百个小型的采矿和冶金企业，所以保持有一支熟练的工人队伍和累积有不少生产经验。
    苏联共产党中央委员会英明地估计了这一切，决定了建立乌拉尔和库兹巴斯的煤铁联合基地，抓住了这个中心环节来解决全盘发展乌拉尔工业和整个东部经济问题。以库兹巴斯的煤来炼乌拉尔的铁，这保证乌拉尔和西伯利亚钢铁工业的发达。在这个基础上，在乌拉尔建立了整套重工业：采矿、冶金、机器制造、化学、木材、电力。在乌克兰煤铁中心以外，乌拉尔和库兹巴斯这第二个煤铁中心的建立，加速了苏联的社会主义工业化。
    乌拉尔成为现代化的综合发展的重工业区，是从苏联第一个五年计划时期开始的。在这个期间有一百四十九个大企业在乌拉尔建立并且全部或局部地开工了，还有八十个大企业开始建设和近百个企业改造。像马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合企业、乌拉尔重型机器制造厂、车里雅宾斯克拖拉机制造厂等等，都是在这个期间建立的。乌拉尔的大工业产量，从一九二七—一九二八年到一九三二年增长了约两倍半。第二个五年计划时期，乌拉尔工业建设的规模更大。全苏联建设的资金百分之二十一点二投在乌拉尔重工业上。由于着重发展机器制造业的大规模的建设，乌拉尔由采煤冶金区变为以制造机器为主的苏联最大工业区之一。在第三个五年计划的头三年，乌拉尔的生铁和钢的产量已经达到全苏联产量的近五分之一，化学品为五分之一，铜、镍、铝、镁的产量占全苏联第一位，石油占第二位，电力占第三位，机器制造业占第四位。乌拉尔工业以重工业为主，轻工业和食品工业只供应乌拉尔居民的生活需要。
    在战前几个五年计划时期，乌拉尔已经工业化了。工业化的乌拉尔是苏联实现工业合理分布的原则的范例。这个分布原则要求：开发国家的富源，各个地区的多方面发展，推进经济不发达的地区，使工业接近原料产地和消费地区，加强国防力量。在第一个五年计划开始以前，苏联的工业集中在莫斯科、列宁格勒和乌克兰。乌拉尔工业区的建立，使许多工业产品不必再从西方老远地运到东方。乌拉尔以自己生产的钢铁、高级钢、铜、机器、石油、化学品、木材等等同全国特别是东部各个地区发生联系，支持东部各个地区的工农业和运输业的发展。依靠当地富源建立起来的乌拉尔各门工业也相互联系和彼此保证。例如：在下塔吉尔我看到了苏联最大的乌拉尔车厢制造厂。这个工厂的生产是机械化的，流水作业的，大规模的。工厂已经在一九五四年在提高劳动生产率方面完成了第五个五年计划。它生产车厢，新塔吉尔钢铁厂生产钢轨，这些产品保证着东部铁路运输的发展。新塔吉尔钢铁厂的轧轨机是乌拉尔重型机器制造厂供给的，而后者又从马格尼托哥尔斯克等钢铁厂取得钢材。乌拉尔建立了许多强大的火力发电站，它们把利用当地的煤发出的电力，都输送到乌拉尔的统一的发电网中去，由发电网的调度员按照各个工业企业的需要再统一分配。从这里可以看出乌拉尔工业生产的计划性。
    乌拉尔工业区对于国防的作用，在苏联卫国战争时期，得到充分的证明。在这个时期，乌拉尔变成苏联强有力的兵工厂，它出产的产品占全国军事工业产品的百分之四十。乌拉尔工业区在战时大大发展了。乌拉尔最大的工业中心斯维德洛夫斯克的工业产品从一九四○年到一九四四年增长了七倍，出现了许多新的工业中心。机器制造业在工业中的比重从一九四○年的百分之四十二点七提高为一九四三年的百分之七十。车床、电机、仪器的制造业特别发达。
    战后乌拉尔的工业不断迈步前进。在一九五四年，苏联东部地区（乌拉尔、伏尔加流域、西伯利亚、远东、哈萨克斯坦和中亚各共和国）生产的工业品，占苏联工业总产量三分之一，钢和钢材占一半以上，煤占一半，石油占百分之六十以上，电力占百分之四十以上。全苏联工业总产量在一九五四年为一九四○年的二点八倍，而苏联东部地区在一九五四年为一九四○年的四倍。
    乌拉尔劳动者以社会主义竞赛争取超额地完成第五个五年计划。乌拉尔工业企业正在进一步地广泛地运用科学技术的新成就和先进的生产经验，以加强专业化和协作。
    苏联共产党教导苏联人民必须在按人口计算的生产量方面超过主要的资本主义国家，以便得到丰足的产品和从共产主义的第一阶段过渡到第二阶段。因此，乌拉尔工业虽然那样发达，人们并没有以此自满。不满足于已经得到的胜利果实，在高度工业化的基础上继续提高工业的水平，——这是乌拉尔的特色。
