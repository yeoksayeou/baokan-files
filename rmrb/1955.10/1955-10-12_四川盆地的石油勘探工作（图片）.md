Oil exploration in the Sichuan Basin
Within the nearly 200,000 square kilometers of the Sichuan Basin, exploration personnel have opened up several exploration areas. In February of this year, a shallow well exploration area was established in a certain location. Drilling results confirmed that the underground oil layers in the Sichuan Basin are in good condition, possessing abundant oil reserves. In a certain exploration area, some oil layers are more than 40 meters thick. Now, the workers have formulated production increase and conservation plans, working hard to complete and over fulfill drilling tasks.

    四川盆地的石油勘探工作
    在四川盆地将近二十万平方公里的地区内，勘探人员开辟了几个勘探区，今年二月又在某地建立了浅井勘探区，钻探的结果证实四川盆地地下油层情况良好，蕴藏着丰富的石油。在某勘探区里，有的油层厚度达四十多公尺。现在，工人们订出了增产节约计划，为完成和超额完成钻探任务而努力工作。
    左图：今年新辟的探区，有良好的石油构造。这是新探区的探井之一。
