Xinhua News Agency, 21st. The effective volume utilization coefficient of iron-smelting blast furnaces nationwide has greatly decreased compared to last year. From January to August this year, the average effective volume of blast furnace occupied per ton of iron produced nationwide decreased by more than 4.7% compared to 1954. As a result, this major economic and technical indicator in the iron and steel industry has exceeded the level stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan. Currently, the vast number of iron-smelting workers are continuing to tap potential and strive to further reduce this indicator.

The reduction in China's blast furnace utilization coefficient indicates that iron-smelting workers are producing more pig iron with the same blast furnaces. In the first eight months of this year, as a result of the nationwide iron-smelting plants reducing the blast furnace utilization coefficient, more than 100,000 tons of pig iron were produced than last year without adding equipment. Currently, in many of China's blast furnaces, the output of two blast furnaces with the same volume is greater than the iron produced by three blast furnaces in the old China period due to the substantial reduction in the utilization coefficient. In the two years and eight months of the first Five-Year Plan alone, the increase in pig iron production by iron-smelting workers nationwide due to the reduction in the blast furnace utilization coefficient is equivalent to building a large blast furnace for the country.

The main reason why the national blast furnace utilization coefficient can continue to decrease is that the vast number of iron-smelting workers have conscientiously learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. At present, iron-smelting plants across the country have universally promoted the ore blending method in blast furnace raw material management, which has greatly reduced the fluctuation range of ore composition, so that the blast furnace iron-smelting situation is often maintained in good condition. In terms of blast furnace operation, the important advanced experience of the Soviet Union in iron-smelting - furnace top regulation and steam blowing - has been promoted. Now, most of China's iron-smelting workers have been able to use the method of combining furnace top regulation and lower regulation to grasp the blast furnace situation, abandoning the old operation method of always using lower regulation in isolation, which has changed the serious situation of frequent collapse and hanging accidents in the past. The use of steam blowing in blast furnace production can also ensure increased pig iron production and reduced coke consumption. After Anshan, Benxi and other iron-smelting blast furnaces initially tried this advanced method, pig iron production has increased to varying degrees. According to the inspection of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the blast furnace utilization coefficient of each factory has been greatly reduced due to the promotion of the above-mentioned advanced experience. For example, the effective volume of blast furnace occupied per ton of iron produced by the blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Company from January to August this year decreased from 0.927 cubic meters last year to 0.863 cubic meters. Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant decreased from 0.901 cubic meters last year to 0.892 cubic meters.

### 全国高炉利用系数超过五年计划规定指标

    全国高炉利用系数超过五年计划规定指标
    新华社二十一日讯　全国炼铁高炉有效容积利用系数比去年有很大降低，今年一月到八月，每炼一吨铁所占用的高炉有效容积，全国平均比一九五四年减少了百分之四点七以上。至此，炼铁工业中的这一项主要经济技术指标，已超过了第一个五年计划所规定的水平。目前，广大炼铁工人正继续挖掘潜力，争取进一步降低这项指标。
    我国高炉利用系数的降低，表示着炼铁工人用同样的高炉炼出了更多的生铁。在今年头八个月内，全国炼铁厂降低高炉利用系数的结果，在没有增添设备的情况下比去年多生产十多万吨生铁。目前，我国很多高炉由于利用系数大大降低，同样容积的两座高炉的产量比旧中国时期三座高炉生产的铁还要多。仅在第一个五年计划的两年零八个月内，全国炼铁工人因高炉利用系数降低所增加的生铁产量，等于为国家增建了一座大型高炉。
    全国高炉利用系数能够不断降低的主要原因，是广大炼铁工人认真地学习了苏联的先进经验。目前，全国炼铁厂在高炉原料管理方面普遍推行了矿石混匀方法，矿石成份波动范围大大减少，使高炉炼铁情况经常保持良好。在高炉操作方面，推广了苏联炼铁方面重大先进经验——炉顶调剂和蒸汽鼓风。现在，我国大多数炼铁工人已能用炉顶调剂和下部调剂结合的方法来掌握高炉情况，抛弃了一向孤立地采用下部调剂的陈旧操作方法，这样就改变了过去经常发生崩料、悬料等事故的严重情况。在高炉生产中采用蒸汽鼓风方法，同样能保证增加生铁产量，减少焦炭消耗。鞍山、本溪等炼铁高炉初步试用了这一先进方法后，生铁产量都有不同程度的提高。据重工业部检查，各厂由于推广了上述先进经验，高炉利用系数都大大降低。如鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂高炉今年一月到八月每炼一吨铁所占用的高炉有效容积，由去年的零点九二七立方公尺降低到零点八六三立方公尺。石景山钢铁厂由去年的零点九零一立方公尺降低到零点八九二立方公尺。
