    Art Should Become a Sharp Weapon for Striving for Peace, Democracy, and Socialism
    Head of the Soviet Artists Delegation, Si Niqishijin

    The fate of our generation of Soviet people is closely linked with the fate of revolutionary China, and with the heroic Chinese people who are resolutely and confidently striving for the freedom and independence of their motherland.

    From the earliest days of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the great Soviet people, having freed themselves from the shackles of their own country's oppressors, extended a hand of friendship to the heroic Chinese people. The great Soviet poet Mayakovsky brilliantly expressed this feeling and thought:

    Tens of millions
      of workers in China,
    Reach out
      your hands
          to forge eternal friendship!

    For decades, the Soviet people have been watching the struggle of the Chinese people with concern and excitement, helping them in this struggle, and firmly believing in their victory.

    The Chinese people, under the leadership of their great Communist Party, have finally won victory!

    China’s great people’s democratic revolution, of worldwide historical significance, has awakened hundreds of millions of Chinese people, and inspired the powerful creativity of the Chinese people who have been bound by oppressors for generations. Therefore, within a few years, China has been transformed into a powerful country confidently striding towards the heights of socialism.

    Socialism is the goal of our arduous struggle. We must reach socialism, because socialism is a cause created by our own hands. - This conviction could be seen on the faces of the hundreds of thousands of working people who marched in Beijing to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We deeply believe in this powerful and purposeful expression of the Chinese people.

    Those people who vividly, sincerely, and unitedly demonstrated their strength, their solidarity, and their boundless trust in their people's government and beloved Communist Party will never deviate from the path of striving for peace, democracy, and socialism. And they will surely achieve complete victory.

    The Chinese revolution and its victory have revived and advanced, on a new basis, China's great and immortal, oldest culture, as well as the outstanding, deeply moving, and very unique art of the Chinese people.

    Soviet literary and art workers have always been interested in Chinese culture and art, studying them, and paying attention to their development.

    However, only from the moment of the establishment of the People's Republic of China has the door been opened and all possibilities created for Soviet and Chinese people to truly and comprehensively study the cultures and arts of the two great nations, and to exchange experiences with each other.

    The six years of Sino-Soviet cultural ties have proven that both China and the Soviet Union have gained much from each other and enriched their spiritual cultures. Because this is the purpose of our cultural ties, this is the purpose of our delegation and other Soviet cultural delegations, as well as the various cultural delegations sent by the Chinese people to the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet people are proud that the creations of their great writers and playwrights are loved by the Chinese people, enriching their knowledge, allowing them to absorb our revolutionary experience, and providing them with aesthetic enjoyment. These writers and playwrights include Tolstoy, Gogol, A. Ostrovsky, Chekhov, Gorky, Mayakovsky, N. Ostrovsky, and other Soviet writers and playwrights.

    We are pleased to see Chinese theaters staging the works of outstanding Russian classical playwrights and representatives of Soviet drama: Tolstoy's "Resurrection," Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment," A. Ostrovsky's "The Forest," Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," Gorky's "The Lower Depths," Sofronov's "Moscow Character," and plays adapted from N. Ostrovsky's novel "How the Steel Was Tempered," etc.

    We are proud that the creations of our excellent singers, musicians, and other actors have been successful and have benefited the spiritual development of the Chinese people.

    We Soviet people also do not reject the outstanding cultural heritage of all nations and all eras, because, as Comrade Zhdanov, a prominent activist of our Communist Party, said, all the outstanding cultural achievements of mankind "inspire the workers of Soviet society to engage in great undertakings in labor, science, and culture"; we are especially pleased to utilize the outstanding cultural heritage of the Chinese people, who are ideologically friendly and close to us.

    The heritage of ancient Chinese culture is also immortal to us: the folk creations of the Yangshao culture reflected in extraordinarily beautiful pottery; the jade, lacquerware, and bronze mirrors of the Han Dynasty; the paintings on silk or paper from the fourth to sixth centuries; the amazing architectural art—all of this inspires us and promotes the birth of new things. Soviet art absorbs the best of your art from recent centuries and the newest art of People's China.

    The Soviet people are very interested in and love the works of Guo Moruo, Lu Xun, Lao She, Hu Ke, and other writers, and our theaters also stage the works of your playwrights. The performance of "The White-Haired Girl" by He Jingzhi and Ding Yi at the Vakhtangov Theater and the Buryat Mongolian Opera House was a great success; Guo Moruo's "Qu Yuan" performed by the Moscow Yermolova Theater, Wang Shifu's "Romance of the West Chamber" performed by the Moscow Satire Theater and the Yaroslavl Volkov Theater, and Hu Ke's "Growing Up in Battle" performed by the Soviet Army Theater, etc., have all been very successful. In this year alone, tens of thousands of Soviet audiences have watched the outstanding and unique Yue opera with great interest, and have seen Chinese acrobatics. The superb skills and appealing techniques of the acrobatic troupe's actors are amazing. All of this shows the great desire to promote the prosperity of culture and art together.

    This mutual enrichment of culture will increase year by year and will bring greater benefits, because both Soviet and Chinese art are based on the inspiring ideology of Marxism-Leninism. In the art of our two countries, there is a common method—socialist realism—and a common goal—to serve our own people, to help them build communism, and to fight for world peace.

    Chinese art, like the great Chinese people, has a bright future. Because the Chinese people love art, because they are wise and hardworking.

    Chinese art has a bright future because the Chinese government has created favorable conditions for the development of art. I was convinced of this when I was received by Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China. Comrade Mao Zedong's cordial and friendly conversation with the leaders of the cultural delegations from five countries—including the Soviet Union—will remain indelibly etched in my memory forever.

    Chinese art has a never-extinguished lighthouse—the great Chinese Communist Party. This lighthouse illuminates its path and will guide it to achieve new accomplishments.

    We wish Chinese art more and more achievements.

    Let Chinese art be inseparable from Soviet art, just like the unbreakable great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    Let the art of our two countries be worthy of our great people.

### 艺术应当成为争取和平、民主和社会主义的锐利武器

    艺术应当成为争取和平、民主和社会主义的锐利武器
    苏联艺术家代表团团长  斯·尼基什金
    我们这一代苏联人的命运是同革命的中国的命运，同那坚决地、满怀信心地争取自己祖国的自由和独立的英勇的中国人民密切联系着的。
    从伟大十月社会主义革命的最初日子起，伟大的苏联人民在摆脱了本国的奴役者的枷锁之后，向英勇的中国人民伸出了友谊的手。苏维埃时代的伟大诗人马雅可夫斯基曾卓越地表达了这种感情和思想：
    千千万万的
      工人的中国，
    伸出
      手来
          结成永远的友谊！
    苏联人几十年来都在关切地、兴奋地注视着中国人民的斗争，帮助他们进行这个斗争，并坚信他们的胜利。
    中国人民在自己的伟大共产党领导下终于获得了胜利！
    中国的伟大的具有全世界历史意义的人民民主革命，唤醒了亿万的中国人民大众，鼓舞了世世代代为压迫者所束缚的中国人民的强有力的创造力，因此，使中国在几年之内就变成了一个满怀信心地向社会主义顶峰大踏步前进的强有力的国家。
    社会主义就是我们艰苦斗争的目标。我们一定要走到社会主义，因为社会主义是我们双手创造的事业。——这种信念，我们在庆祝中华人民共和国建国六周年时从北京游行的数十万劳动人民的脸上都可以看得到。我们深深地相信中国人民这种强有力的和富有目的性的表现。
    那些在广场上鲜明地、真诚地和团结一致地表现了他们的力量、他们的团结和他们对自己的人民政府和亲爱的共产党的无限信赖的人民，是决不会离开争取和平、民主和社会主义的道路的。而且他们一定会获得完全胜利。
    中国的革命和它的胜利，复活了、并且在新基础上向前发展了中国的伟大的和不朽的最古老的文化，以及中国人民的卓越的、深深动人的非常独特的艺术。
    苏联的文艺工作者一直对中国的文化和艺术感到兴趣，研究它们，并注视着它们的发展。
    但是，只是从建立中华人民共和国的那一刻起，才为苏联人和中国人真正地、全面地研究两大国的文化和艺术，为互相交流经验打开了大门并创造了一切可能。
    六年来的中苏文化联系证明，无论是中国或苏联都互相获得了许多东西并丰富了自己的精神文化。因为我们的文化联系的目的就在于此，我们这个代表团和苏联的其他文化代表团，以及中国人民派到苏联去的各种文化代表团的目的，就在于此。
    苏联人民以自己的伟大作家和剧作家的创作享有中国人民的爱戴，丰富了他们的知识，使他们吸取到我们的革命经验并享到美感而自豪。这些作家和剧作家如：托尔斯泰、果戈理、阿·奥斯特洛夫斯基、契诃夫、高尔基、马雅可夫斯基、尼·奥斯特洛夫斯基和其他苏联的作家和剧作家。
    我们高兴地看到中国剧院在自己的舞台上演出了俄罗斯优秀的古典剧作家和苏联戏剧创作代表者的剧作：托尔斯泰的“复活”，陀思妥夫斯基的“罪与罚”，阿·奥斯特洛夫斯基的“森林”，契诃夫的“万尼亚舅舅”，高尔基的“底层”，索弗罗诺夫的“莫斯科性格”，根据尼·奥斯特洛夫斯基的小说“钢铁是怎样炼成的”改编的剧等。
    我们感到自豪的是：我们优秀的歌手、音乐家和其他演员的创作都得到了成功并给中国人民的精神发展带来了好处。
    我们苏联人也不拒绝各国人民、各个时代的优秀文化遗产，因为，正如我国共产党的一个杰出活动家日丹诺夫同志所说的，人类的一切优秀文化成果都“鼓舞着苏维埃社会的劳动者在劳动中、科学和文化中去从事伟大的事业”；我们尤其高兴的是运用在思想上同我们友爱而亲近的中国人民的优秀文化遗产。
    中国古代文化的遗产对于我们说来也是不朽的：反映在异常美丽的陶器上的仰韶期文化的民间创作；汉朝的玉器、漆器、铜镜；四世纪到六世纪的画在绢上或纸上的绘画；令人惊叹的建筑艺术——所有这一切都鼓舞着我们并推动新事物的诞生。苏联艺术吸收了你们最近几百年艺术中最优秀的东西和人民中国最新的艺术。
    苏联人民很感兴趣也很喜爱郭沫若、鲁迅、老舍、胡可和其他作家的作品，我国剧院也上演你们剧作家的作品。贺敬之和丁毅的“白毛女”在瓦赫坦戈夫剧院和布略特蒙古歌剧院的上演，获得了很大的成功；莫斯科叶尔莫洛瓦剧院演出的郭沫若的“屈原”，莫斯科讽刺剧院和雅罗斯拉夫里的沃尔科夫剧院等演出的王实甫的“西厢记”，苏军剧院演出的胡可的“在战斗里成长”等，也都获得了很大的成功。仅在今年一年，成千上万的苏联观众非常感兴趣地观赏了卓越的、独具风格的越剧，看到了中国的杂技。杂技团演员们的精湛的技术和吸引人的技巧使人惊叹不已。所有这一切都表明了相互促进文化和艺术繁荣的伟大愿望。
    这种文化上的互相丰富将一年比一年增长，并将带来更大的利益，因为无论苏联的或中国的艺术，都是以令人鼓舞的马克思列宁主义思想为基础的。在我们两国的艺术中，有着共同的方法——社会主义现实主义，和共同的目的——为自己的人民服务，帮助他们建设共产主义，为全世界的和平而斗争。
    中国的艺术也正像伟大的中国人民一样，是有远大前途的。因为中国人民热爱艺术，因为他们智慧而勤劳。
    中国的艺术前途远大，因为中国政府为艺术的发展创造了有利的条件。我在受到中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志的接待时对这一点确信无疑。毛泽东同志同五个国家——其中包括苏联的文化代表团的领导人员的亲切的、友谊的谈话，将永远不可磨灭地留在我的记忆中。
    中国的艺术有一座永不熄灭的灯塔——伟大的中国共产党。这座灯塔给它照耀着道路，并将引导它取得新的成就。
    我们祝中国的艺术取得更多更多的成就。
    让中国的艺术同苏联的艺术永不可分，就像中苏两国人民的牢不可破的伟大友谊一样。
    让我们两国的艺术无愧于自己伟大的人民。
