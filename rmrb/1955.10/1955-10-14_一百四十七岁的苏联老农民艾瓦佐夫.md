    一百四十七岁的苏联老农民艾瓦佐夫
    不久以前，在莫斯科，来了一位一百四十七岁的老人，他的名字叫马赫姆德·艾瓦佐夫。
    艾瓦佐夫是阿塞拜疆共和国“共青团”集体农庄的庄员和农庄的创建人。他的家乡位于阿塞拜疆的一个拔海两千多公尺的山村中。
    艾瓦佐夫在阿塞拜疆共和国是一个很有名的人物。他已经作了一百多年的牧羊人。在这样漫长的岁月中，他赶着羊群走遍了故乡的高山和峡谷。他还是个务庄稼的能手，他作的木工活和铁工活也很精巧。此外，他还养过蜂和家禽。现在，他仍然继续同他的儿子们一块在集体农庄里劳动。
    艾瓦佐夫是一个有一百五十二口人的大家庭的家长。他有二十三个儿女，大女儿今年已经一百二十岁了。在他的儿子中，有牧羊人、教师、果园种植者和农民，也有石油工人和苏军战士。
    他这一次是到莫斯科参观和旅行的。在莫斯科期间，他参观了苏联农业展览会、克里姆林宫、莫斯科大学和苏联科学院。（新华社）
