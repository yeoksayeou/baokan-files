    The Practice of Disregarding Worker Safety for the Sake of Production Must Be Stopped
    To the Editors:
    The Shenyang Refractory Material Factory does not conscientiously implement internal labor regulations. Many leading staff members frequently and arbitrarily violate operating procedures. The security system and operating procedures clearly stipulate that "the kiln temperature should not exceed 80 degrees Celsius," but the factory's relevant leaders, in order to complete the production task, disregard worker safety and arbitrarily increase the kiln temperature. For example, on May 31, the kiln temperature reached as high as 105 degrees Celsius, but the on-site deputy director Qian Jiatai and foreman Xin Mengxi ordered the workers to get the kiln out earlier before going to work. On July 10, the temperature inside No. 4 square kiln and No. 5 round kiln in the first workshop was as high as 120 degrees Celsius, but in order to rush the task, Factory Director Yang actually approved the kiln opening.
    In order to pursue output, this factory does not pay enough attention to product quality. One day at the end of April, the kiln temperature in the second workshop was very high. In order to accelerate cooling and reduce the temperature, Luo Youtang, the person in charge of the workshop, asked the workers to spray cold water into the kiln (Editor's note: It is wrong to spray cold water into the kiln casually, but the experience of water-cooling temperature reduction in the wheel kiln of the Soviet Ochakovsky Brick Factory can be learned). As a result, many refractory bricks cracked and became waste products, causing losses to the country.
    The leading staff members of this factory should pay attention to these problems and conscientiously implement the internal labor regulations of the enterprise.

### 必须制止为了生产而不顾工人安全的做法

    必须制止为了生产而不顾工人安全的做法编辑同志：
    沈阳耐火材料厂不认真贯彻企业内部劳动规则，许多领导工作人员经常任意违反操作规程。保安制度和操作规程上明确规定“出窑温度不得超过摄氏八十度”，但是厂里的有关领导人员为了完成生产任务，就不管工人的安全，随便提高出窑温度。如五月三十一日，窑内温度高达一百零五度，而现场副主任钱家泰和工长辛孟修竟命令工人在上班前趁早出窑。七月十日，一现场四号方窑和五号圆窑里面的温度高达一百二十度，为了赶任务，杨厂长居然也批准出窑。
    这个工厂为了追求产量，对产品质量也是不够重视的。四月底有一天，二现场窑内温度很高，为了加速冷却，降低温度，现场负责人罗有堂叫工人往窑内喷冷水（编者按：随便往窑内喷冷水是错误的，但是可以学习苏联敖恰科夫斯基砖厂轮窑的水冷却降温经验），结果许多耐火砖都发生裂痕，成为废品，给国家造成了损失。
    这个工厂的领导工作人员应该重视这些问题，认真贯彻企业内部劳动规则。
