To the Editor:

Our Shenguanyao natural village in Lingquan Township has only twenty-six households. Since 1954, many farmers have continuously requested the establishment of a cooperative. After studying Chairman Mao's and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's instructions on agricultural cooperation, which were conveyed by the county committee, the township cadres were filled with confidence and wanted to establish a twenty-household agricultural production cooperative in Shenguanyao. However, when the township leaders held a mass meeting in the village to report on the current new situation of cooperation and the Party branch's plan to establish a cooperative, not many farmers signed up to join; moreover, some of those who had signed up were not fully committed. This showed that we had taken the establishment of the cooperative too simply and launched the membership drive hastily without proper preparation.

After studying the situation, our township branch accepted this lesson and decided to first deeply understand the ideological concerns of the masses. As a result, we found that because Shenguanyao is a mountainous area, farmers spend half the year engaged in sideline occupations such as transporting coal, and many were afraid that joining the cooperative would tie them to the land and prevent them from engaging in sideline occupations. In addition, some households with weak or no labor power were afraid that they would not be able to work and survive after joining the cooperative. Still other farmers were afraid that the cooperative would not be successful because most of those who signed up were poor peasants with "not much of a family fortune." Based on this situation, the branch decided to repeatedly educate the farmers on the advantages of several old cooperatives in our township, and to preliminarily set up the framework of the cooperative based on the households that had already signed up, so as to put it into production in a timely manner, so as to demonstrate the superiority of the cooperative from production and attract farmers to take the road of cooperation.

Therefore, under the leadership of the branch, the twelve households that had signed up were reviewed, and ten households were temporarily confirmed as members. After full deliberation and discussion, five people were selected to participate in the county-level training class for cooperative establishment key personnel, and three people were selected to lead and organize the existing eight male laborers and ten female laborers to put them into production in a timely manner. In just over twenty days, the agricultural production cooperative did three things in production, which greatly demonstrated the superiority of the agricultural production cooperative. The first thing was to quickly complete the wheat sowing task in two days. The ten households had more than forty acres of wheat fields. According to the existing labor force, five plows were organized, and women were mobilized to sow wheat seeds, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient labor. As a result, the wheat was sown in two days (only three plows were used on the afternoon of the second day), five or six days earlier than ordinary farmers, and the quality was also better. The second thing was to organize women to cut wormwood and compost more than 4,000 catties of fertilizer, composting two large piles of fertilizer beside the doors of the village. This event had an even greater impact on the masses. Farmer Han Tianquan said, "The women who joined the cooperative have also changed! They used to be inactive, but now they are really useful." The third thing was to organize the surplus labor from the autumn harvest to plant trees, reclaim wasteland, and engage in sideline occupations. Through discussion, the cooperative ranked the ten households' autumn crops according to the crops and maturity, determined the order of harvesting, and stipulated a unified harvesting and compensation for losses. Because of the unified use of labor and the mobilization of women to participate in labor, it was possible to spare time during the autumn harvest to plant trees, reclaim wasteland, and engage in sideline occupations. As of October 6th, one mu of trees had been planted, six mu of wasteland had been reclaimed, and one green storage cellar had been built; some members also took the time to transport coal. The people at home also helped the families of those who went out for training and sideline occupations with odd jobs such as carrying water and coal.

The above facts not only strengthened the thinking of the members who had already signed up, but also attracted more farmers to request membership. For example, Han Tianquan said, "I didn't sign up a few days ago because I saw that the ten or so households who signed up in the cooperative were not up to the task. I didn't expect the cooperative to be better at production than anyone else, and they still take the time to transport coal and engage in sideline occupations. What about us? We only care about transporting coal, and the millet is ripe but we haven't harvested it yet!" Han Xiusheng, a farmer who was afraid that joining the cooperative would delay his sideline occupations, also decided to sign up after seeing that the cooperative was doing better in sideline occupations than those outside the cooperative without affecting production. Han Xiugen and other households lacking labor also dispelled their concerns. As of October 6th, the number of farmers in the village who signed up to join the cooperative quickly increased to twenty-three households.

### 建社一定要做好准备工作

    建社一定要做好准备工作编辑同志：
    我们岭泉乡的神官窑自然村，全村只有二十六家。一九五四年以来，不少农民不断要求建社。乡干部在学习了县委传达的毛主席和中共中央关于农业合作化问题的指示以后，就满怀信心地要在神官窑建立一个二十户的农业生产合作社。但是，当乡里的领导人员在这个村召开了群众大会报告了目前合作化的新形势和党支部的建社计划以后，农民报名入社的并不算多，两天只有十二户报了名；而且有些已报名入社的农民思想也不完全坚定。说明了我们把建社工作看得太简单了，还没有做好准备工作就仓促发动入社。
    我们乡支部经过研究，接受这个教训，决定先要深入了解群众的思想顾虑。结果发现，由于神官窑是山区，农民一年有半年工夫搞驮炭等副业，很多人都怕入了社缚在土地上，不能搞副业；另外，有些劳力弱和无劳力的农户怕入社后不能劳动活不了，还有些农民看到报名入社的大部是“家底不厚实”的贫农而怕社搞不好。根据这个情况，支部决定一面把本乡几个老社的优越性向农民进行反复教育，一面就在已经报名入社的农户的基础上初步搭起社的架子，及时投入生产，以便从生产中显示社的优越性，吸引农民走合作化道路。
    于是，在支部领导下，对已经报名的十二户进行了审查，暂时肯定了十户社员。经过充分酝酿讨论，选出了五个人参加县上举办的建社骨干训练班，并选出三个人在家领导和组织现有的八个男劳力和十个女劳力及时投入生产。仅仅二十多天工夫，农业生产合作社在生产上就办了三件事情，大大显示了农业生产合作社的优越性。第一件是在两天内迅速完成了种麦任务。十户农民共有四十多亩麦田，根据现有劳力组织了五犋犁，并发动妇女溜麦籽，克服了劳力不足的困难，结果两天就把小麦种好了（第二天下午还只出了三犋犁），比一般农民早种了五、六天，而且质量也好。第二件是组织妇女割蒿沤肥四千余斤，在村里门旁沤下两大堆肥料。这件事对群众惊动更大，农民韩田全说：“入了社的妇女也变啦！原来不动弹，现在真顶事。”第三件是组织了秋收中节余的劳力种树、开荒和搞副业。社里通过讨论，把十户的秋庄稼按作物和成熟情况排了队，确定了收割次序，规定了统一收割、损失包赔的办法。由于劳动力统一使用和发动了妇女参加劳动，因而在秋收中还能够抽出时间种树、开荒、搞副业，到十月六日为止已种树一亩、开荒地六亩、打成贮青窖一个；有的社员还抽空去驮炭。在家的人还帮助外出受训和搞副业的人家干担水、担炭等杂活。
    以上事实，不但使已经报名的社员坚定了思想，而且吸引了更多的农民要求入社。例如，韩田全说：“前几天我不报名，就是看见社里报名的十来家不顶事。想不到社里生产比谁都搞的好，还抽空驮炭搞副业。咱呢？只顾驮炭了，谷子黄了还没收割回来！”以前怕入社耽误副业的农民韩秀生，看到社里在不影响生产的情况下，副业搞得比在社外还好，也下决心报了名。韩秀根等缺乏劳力的农户也打消了顾虑。到十月六日为止，全村报名入社的农户，很快就增加到二十三户。
