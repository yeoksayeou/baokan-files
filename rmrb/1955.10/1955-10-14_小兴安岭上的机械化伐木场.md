    Mechanized Logging Yard in the Lesser Khingan Mountains
    Bing Ruinian
    The Second Logging Yard of the Dailing Forest Industry Experimental School in Heilongjiang Province is the first mechanized logging yard established in the Lesser Khingan Mountains. In the forest farm, electrician Lyu Changji and his two assistants calmly press a button and fell two large trees, 60 centimeters in diameter, in five minutes. This is the amount of work that a handsaw would take an hour to complete. Winch operator Li Shihua and others sat on the operating platforms of two winches, watching the signals, and gently holding the brake levers. The huge logs, like hooked fish, were pulled from the mountains half a mile away along the wire ropes, and then lifted by the winch with gantry frames and loaded onto trucks. Li Shihua said: "When I sit here, combining timber collecting and loading, I do the work of fifteen people and nine oxen in a day."
    Here, mechanized production has completely replaced heavy manual labor. This year, this logging yard is undertaking the production task of 42,000 cubic meters of timber with 110 workers and 10 cadres. If this task were to be completed entirely by manual labor, it would require 420 workers and more than 40 cadres. However, due to the implementation of mechanized production, this logging yard is completing its production tasks on a monthly and quarterly basis.
    These skilled electricians and winch operators were originally manual workers who used handsaws to fell trees and drove oxen to drag logs. In December 1953, they began to learn to operate the machines in the severe cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius. In order to master the winch, Li Shihua did not return to the dormitory for lunch for several noons in a row, staying by the machine to observe and study it. Later, he and the team leader studied and improved the organization of labor, further rationalizing the division of labor, and production efficiency improved day by day. Electrician Lyu Changji and the team workers constantly researched and experimented, increasing logging efficiency threefold. Now, a winch can collect and load more than 40 cubic meters of timber on an area of 250 meters per day, and each electric saw can fell 90 cubic meters of timber per day, with a maximum of 120 cubic meters.

    小兴安岭上的机械化伐木场
    邴瑞年
    黑龙江省带岭森林工业实验学校第二伐木场是小兴安岭上最先建立的一座机械化伐木场。在林场里，电锯手吕长吉和他的两个助手，从容不迫地一按电钮，在五分钟内就伐倒两棵六十公分粗的大树，这是弯把子锯一个小时才能完成的工作量。绞盘机手李世华等分别坐在两台绞盘机的操纵台上，眼睛看着信号，手轻轻地扶着闸把，巨大的原条木就像上了钩的鱼，顺着油丝绳从半里外的山上被牵过来，然后又被绞盘机用架杆架起来，装到车上。李世华说：“我往这一坐，连集材带装车，一天就赶上十五个人和九头牛干的活。”
    在这里，机械化生产已经完全代替了笨重的体力劳动。今年，这个伐木场以一百一十个工人和十个干部担负着四万二千立方公尺木材的生产任务。这个任务如果完全用手工劳动来完成，需要四百二十个工人和四十多个干部。可是由于实行机械化生产，这个伐木场正在按月按季完成生产任务。
    这些熟练的电锯手、绞盘机手原来就是以前那些用弯把锯伐木、拿皮鞭赶老牛套子拖木头的手工业工人。一九五三年的十二月，他们开始在零下四十度的严寒中学习操纵机械。为了掌握绞盘机，李世华曾一连几个午间不回工舍吃饭，一直守在机器旁边观察、琢磨。以后他又和组长研究，改进了劳动组织，进一步合理分工，生产效率一天一天提高了。电锯手吕长吉和小组工人，不断地研究、试验，使伐木效率提高了三倍。现在一台绞盘机一天在二百五十公尺面积上可连集带装四十多立方公尺木材，每台电锯每天伐木九十立方公尺，最高达一百二十立方公尺。
