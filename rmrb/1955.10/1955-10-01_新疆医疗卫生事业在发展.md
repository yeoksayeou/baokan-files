    In 1954, on the Lunar New Year's Eve, everyone was joyfully preparing for the Spring Festival. Jiang Xiumin, from the Tacheng Maternal and Child Health Station, rode her horse through the night, braving the severe cold of minus 25 degrees Celsius, galloping across the heavily snow-covered grassland. She was going to the third village of the third township in the first district of Tuoli County, more than 100 li away, to treat a Kazakh herder woman who was experiencing a difficult childbirth.

    The parturient, Kaxi, had been running a high fever for two or three days, and was already unconscious. The placental tissue had begun to fester, and her life was in great danger. Jiang Xiumin found a few pieces of wood, quickly set up a temporary operating table, and performed a curettage for the parturient. With her patient care, Kaxi was saved from danger. The parturient's family was very grateful to her. Jiang Xiumin also felt immense joy. She was happy along with the parturient's whole family, and she felt that saving a life was much better than staying at home for the New Year.

    In Xinjiang, such stories are no longer uncommon. In recent years, in more remote agricultural and pastoral areas such as Altay and Hotan, one can often hear stories of young medical personnel from the interior, traveling long distances and working tirelessly to serve the health of all ethnic groups. In Xinjiang, it is no longer just people living in cities who can go to hospitals for treatment; the lives and health of working people in villages, pastures, and mountain valleys are also protected by medical and health institutions.

    Currently, every prefecture and autonomous prefecture of all ethnic groups at the prefecture level in Xinjiang has a People's Hospital, and each county also has a health center. Even in the Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County on the Pamir Plateau, and Qinghe County at the southern foot of the Altay Mountains, which has only more than 2,000 Kazakh residents, there are also health centers. In addition, health stations have been established in more than 40 districts and townships. The number of beds in Xinjiang's People's Hospitals, health centers, and some specialized medical institutions has more than doubled compared to before liberation; the number of medical personnel at all levels has increased more than fivefold compared to before liberation. In hospitals, spacious and comfortable wards, treatment rooms, and scientific medical equipment are increasing year by year. In terms of the number of treatments, in the Provincial People's Hospital alone, the number of outpatients and inpatients in 1954 increased more than fivefold compared to 1950.

    On the vast Gobi Desert, relying solely on outpatient treatment cannot fully meet the needs of the people. People live very scattered, and the vast majority of herdsmen still live a nomadic life, moving with the water and grass all year round. Therefore, medical institutions at all levels often send many medical personnel in the hot summer or cold winter, trekking through high mountains or deserts day and night to provide mobile medical services to farmers and herdsmen. The Anti-epidemic Medical Team and the Ethnic Health Work Team led by the Xinjiang Health Department are constantly busy in the Tianshan Mountains, north and south, preventing and treating various epidemic diseases. In order to ensure that poor people receive medical treatment for their illnesses, the central government has allocated a large amount of special funds for subsidized or free medical care over the years, benefiting tens of millions of people.

    Venereal diseases are the most serious diseases left over from the old society that endanger the lives and health of fraternal ethnic groups. After liberation, thanks to the active prevention and treatment by the People's Government, its spread has been basically controlled. In the past two years, the Provincial Ethnic Health Work Team has adopted a method of focusing on comprehensive surveys and treatments in Tacheng Prefecture and Bukesair Mongolian Autonomous County, and in Tuoli, Emin, Usu and other counties, treating more than 10,000 people, achieving good results. For example, in the second village of the third township of the second district of Hebukesair Mongolian Autonomous County, five women who had been infertile for many years have become pregnant or given birth after treatment. A Kazakh woman, Ma'erguwa, holding her baby, said: "I have been married for four years, and this is the first time I have given birth to a baby." In order to further adopt long-term therapies and eradicate venereal diseases, the Skin and Venereal Disease Prevention and Treatment Center built in Urumqi City opened in July of this year.

    The deaths of mothers and infants are a very painful thing to talk about among ethnic minorities. The saying "You only see the mother carrying the child, but you never see the child walking" has been circulating for a long time. The People's Government has included maternal and child health work on the main agenda from the beginning. Now, the People's Hospitals in each prefecture and some county health centers have established obstetrics departments, and 247 provincial maternal and child health centers and maternal and child health institutions at all levels have also been established. Nearly 5,000 new-method midwives and more than 270 maternal and child health workers have been trained, and 300 delivery organizations have been established in the masses in a guided manner. New-method delivery is being vigorously promoted throughout Xinjiang, and in 1954, new-method delivery was used more than 30,200 times. In Urumqi City, the use of new-method delivery accounted for 88.7% of the total number of births. The maternal and child mortality rates have been greatly reduced.

    In some areas of Xinjiang, especially in Hotan and Shache in southern Xinjiang, leprosy is still spreading. Leprosy patients have always been discriminated against, and in the past they were also persecuted by the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, which created a sense of fear among the people. After liberation, the People's Government has also vigorously carried out leprosy prevention and treatment work. According to the principle of on-site management and centralized treatment, a leprosy village and a leprosy hospital were established in Lop County to centrally accommodate nearby patients. This strictly isolates leprosy patients from healthy people, reducing the infection and fear of healthy people. The leprosy hospital has spacious houses, complete equipment, a beautiful surrounding environment, and a refreshing climate, where more than 200 male and female patients who have been discriminated against and persecuted are receiving treatment. The leprosy village is near water and has fertile land. In order to enable patients to settle down here for long-term recuperation, the local government has allocated some new-style walking plows, mowers, and farm animals, and organized them to carry out agricultural production. They can now basically live self-sufficiently.

    Through years of patriotic health campaigns, the sanitation habits of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have been greatly improved. Yanqi Hui Autonomous County, which used to be called the "Black City," has become a clean city; Jiatan Village in Miquan County used to be smelly and poor, but later, because it did a good job in the patriotic health campaign, it also promoted production. Zao'erhan in Aksu County and Xujia Courtyard in Urumqi City, both national health models, have always maintained their honors. After mobilizing the masses to clear garbage, feces, and pests such as mosquitoes, flies, lice, and fleas, the incidence of infectious diseases such as measles, epidemic typhus, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and relapsing fever has been decreasing year by year.

    In order to better serve the health and hygiene of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, improving medical efficiency and training medical cadres has become a central issue facing medical workers. Recently, a wave of learning has emerged in hospitals at all levels. Various advanced Soviet medical methods and advanced medical systems are being gradually implemented. The old tradition of "doctors not going to the door" has been overthrown, and medical prevention work is being carried out more and more deeply in factories, mines, and rural areas. Mobile medical systems, medical contracts, and health organizations have been gradually established in the production workshops of mines and factories and in agricultural production cooperatives; state employees have also universally enjoyed the benefits of free medical care. Unity between Chinese and Western medicine and the promotion of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine have also attracted the high attention of medical workers in the border areas. Acupuncture therapy has special curative effects on some diseases, especially in treating rheumatic arthritis in pastoral areas, vividly educating medical staff to seriously study the medical heritage of the motherland. The work of training ethnic medical cadres has made good progress in the past five years. In addition to the nursing and pharmacy personnel trained in hospitals, as of this summer vacation, the Urumqi Health School has trained more than 700 intermediate medical personnel, midwives, and nurses. Among them, students of Uyghur, Russian, Uzbek, and Xibe ethnic groups account for more than 70%. A modern Xinjiang Medical College is being built in Urumqi City, and it will shoulder the glorious task of training senior medical personnel of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. All medical workers in Xinjiang are confidently contributing their wisdom and strength to the prosperity and development of the autonomous region's economy and culture.

    新疆医疗卫生事业在发展
    吴稚甫
    一九五四年农历除夕，人们都在欢乐地准备过春节。塔城妇婴保健站的蒋绣锦同志，却连夜骑着马，冒着零下二十五度的奇寒，在覆雪很厚的草原上飞跑着。她是到一百华里以外的托里县一区三乡三村，给一个哈萨克族牧民产妇治理难产去的。
    产妇卡喜发高烧两三天了，人已昏迷不醒，胎盘组织开始化脓，性命很危险。蒋绣锦找了几块木板，敏捷地架起一个临时手术床，为产妇作刮子宫手术。在她的耐心护理下，卡喜脱险了。产妇家里人对她非常感激。蒋绣锦也感到莫大的愉快，她和产妇全家人一起高兴，她觉得救活一条性命，比呆在家里过年要好得多。
    在新疆，这样的故事已不算什么稀奇。近两年来在阿勒泰、和阗等更边远的农业和牧业地区，常可以听到来自内地的青年医务人员，长途跋涉，不辞艰苦地为各族人民的健康服务的故事。在新疆，现在不只是住在城市里的人可以进医院治病；在乡村、牧场和山沟里的劳动人民，他们的生命和健康也受到了医药卫生机构的保护。
    目前，新疆每个专区和相当于专区级的各族人民自治州都有了人民医院，各县也有了卫生院。就是在帕米尔高原的塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县，和阿勒泰山南麓，仅有二千多哈萨克族居民的青河县，也有了卫生院。此外，还在四十多个区和乡里建立了卫生所。新疆的人民医院、卫生院和一些专业性的医疗机构的病床数较解放前增加了一倍多；各级医务人员较解放前增加了五倍以上。在医院里，宽敞舒适的病房、诊疗室和科学医疗器械等设备，都在逐年增加。就治疗人数来说，仅在省人民医院，一九五四年的门诊和住院人数，比一九五○年增加了五倍以上。
    在辽阔的戈壁滩上，专门依靠门诊治疗，是不能完全满足人民需要的。人们居住得非常分散，广大牧民还终年过着逐水草而居的游牧生活。因此，各级医疗机构经常在酷暑或严寒的季节，派出很多医务人员，不分白天黑夜跋涉在高山或沙漠里，为农民和牧民进行巡回医疗。新疆卫生厅领导的防疫医疗大队和民族卫生工作队，终年以战斗的姿态奔忙在天山南北，预防和治疗各种流行的疾病。为使贫苦人民疾病得到医疗，中央历年来拨了大批减免费医疗专款，得到减免费医疗的以千万人次计。
    性病是旧社会遗留下来的危害兄弟民族生命健康最严重的疾病。解放后，经过人民政府的积极防治，基本上制止了它的蔓延。近两年省民族卫生工作队在塔城专区和布克赛尔蒙古族自治县和托里、额敏、乌苏等县，采取重点普查普治方法，约治疗了一万多人，取得很好成绩。像和布克赛尔蒙古族自治县二区三乡二村，有五个妇女，多年不生育，经过治疗后，已经怀孕或生育了。哈萨克族妇女马尔古娃抱着她的娃娃说：“我结婚四年，这是第一次生娃娃。”为今后能进一步采用长期疗法，根治性病，在乌鲁木齐市建成的皮肤性病防治所，已在今年七月开诊。
    产妇和婴儿的死亡，在少数民族中谈起来，是一件很惨痛的事。长期流传着“只见娘怀儿，不见儿走路”的说法。人民政府一开始就把妇幼卫生工作列入了主要日程。现在，各专区的人民医院和部分县卫生院都设了产科，还建立了省妇幼保健所和各级妇幼保健机构二百四十七个，培养了近五千名新法接生员和二百七十多名妇幼保健员，有领导地在群众中建立了三百个接生组织。新法接生正在全疆大力推广，一九五四年使用新法接生的已达三万零二百多次。乌鲁木齐市使用新法接生的，占生育总数的百分之八十八点七。妇幼死亡率已大大降低。
    新疆的某些地区，特别是在南疆的和阗、莎车一带，还有麻风病的蔓延。麻风病患者，一贯受人歧视，过去还受到国民党反动统治者的迫害，因此，在人民群众中造成了一种恐惧的心里。解放后，人民政府也大力进行麻风病的防治工作。根据就地管理，集中治疗的方针，在洛浦县建立了麻风病村和一座麻风病院，集中地收容了附近的患者。这样就严密地把麻风病人和健康人隔离开来，减少了对健康人的感染和恐惧。麻风病院房舍宽敞、设备齐全，周围环境幽美，气候清爽，有二百多名曾被歧视和迫害的男女病人在这里疗养。麻风病村近水、土地肥沃，为使病人能安心在这里长期静养，当地政府调拨了一些新式步犁、割草机和耕畜，组织他们进行农业生产，他们现在基本上可以自给自足地生活了。
    经过历年的爱国卫生运动，新疆各族人民群众的清洁卫生习惯已有很大改善。过去被人叫作“黑城”的焉耆回族自治县，变成了清洁市；米泉县夹滩村过去又臭又穷，后来因为搞好了爱国卫生运动，还推动了生产。全国卫生模范阿克苏县的枣尔汉，乌鲁木齐市徐家大院，都一直保持着自己的荣誉。经发动群众清除垃圾粪便和蚊、蝇、虱、蚤等虫害后，使麻疹、斑疹伤寒、白喉、猩红热、回归热等传染病的发病率在逐年下降。
    为了更好地为新疆各族人民的健康和卫生服务，提高医疗效率和培养医务干部已成为摆在医务工作前面的中心课题。最近，在各级医院里普遍出现了学习热潮。苏联各种先进的医疗方法和先进的医疗制度正在逐步推行。“医不上门”的旧传统被打倒了，医疗预防工作正日益深入地在工矿和农村开展。在矿山和工厂的生产间里，在农业生产合作社里，逐步建立了巡回医疗制度、医疗合同和保健组织；国家工作人员也普遍地享受到了公费医疗的待遇。团结中西医和发扬祖国医学遗产，也已引起边疆医务工作者的高度重视。针灸疗法在一些疾病上，尤其在牧区治疗风湿关节炎的特殊疗效，生动地教育了医务工作人员，要认真学习祖国的医学遗产。培养民族医务干部的工作，五年来有很好的进展，在医院训练的护理、药剂人员以外，截至今年暑假，由乌鲁木齐卫生学校培养出的医士、助产士、护士中级人员有七百多名。其中维吾尔、俄罗斯、乌孜别克、锡伯等民族学生占百分之七十以上。乌鲁木齐市已在新建一座近代化的新疆医学院，它将担负起培养新疆各民族高级医务工作人员的光荣任务。新疆全体医务工作人员正满怀信心地为自治区的经济和文化的繁荣和发展，贡献着自己的智慧和力量。
