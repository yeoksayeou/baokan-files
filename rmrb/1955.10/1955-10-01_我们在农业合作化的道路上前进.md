    We Are Advancing on the Road of Agricultural Cooperativization
    Han En, Director of the Happiness Road Agricultural Production Cooperative, Jilin Province

    The sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China has arrived. All members of our Happiness Road Agricultural Production Cooperative are welcoming this great festival with immense excitement.

    In the six years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, with the recovery and development of the motherland's production, millions of farmers have actively participated in various types of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, following the path of "organizing" as instructed by our great leader Chairman Mao. This has greatly developed our country's agricultural production. The farmers of Baotun Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, like millions of other farmers, are also following the path of organizing. Now we have developed from mutual aid teams to fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives. Our production has also greatly developed. In the year the People's Republic of China was founded, we were just a mutual aid team of twenty-odd households. In the spring of 1952, with the help of the Party and the government, we officially established a semi-socialist agricultural production cooperative of twenty-four households. At that time, we only had more than forty hectares of land, twenty-four head of livestock, and four spoke-wheeled carts. In that year, our production took a big step forward: we applied more manure than during the mutual aid team period, improved fifteen hectares of soil, and tended the crops more timely than in previous years, so they grew particularly well. Although we suffered a severe hailstorm that year, through the active rescue efforts of all our members and the application of more than 4,000 jin of fertilizer, we still achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in the autumn. On average, each hectare of our cooperative yielded more than twice as much grain as farmers who suffered the same disaster, more than twice as much as in 1949 during the mutual aid team period, and two and a half times more than before liberation. That year, each labor day was worth 51 jin of grain. Xu Fengshan, the cooperative member who looked after the cattle, received 14 shi of grain, more than double his income during the mutual aid team period. Chang Shougui, a middle peasant cooperative member, and his son used to earn only twenty-odd shi of grain for a year of hard work in the mutual aid team, but after joining the cooperative, they earned forty-nine shi. Farmers outside the cooperative, seeing these facts, all muttered: It has to be said that the strength of the agricultural cooperative is great; if our mutual aid team had encountered this hailstorm, we would have been completely wiped out. In the spring of 1953, before we even started plowing and planting, we bought twenty-two well-fed horses, seven head of cattle, and four brand-new rubber-tired carts. That year, agricultural production increased by 450 jin of grain per hectare compared to the previous year, a total increase of 15,750 jin of grain. Income from sideline occupations increased by 30 percent compared to the previous year. By the end of that year, we had accumulated more than 10,000 yuan in public property. Because our agricultural cooperative increased production and income, farmers in several villages near us all said: Joining the cooperative makes the rich richer, and the poor also become prosperous. In the autumn of 1953, even before we finished threshing, many farmers from nearby villages came every day to request to join the cooperative. Some people even moved from distant counties and districts to join the cooperative. By winter, our cooperative had expanded to forty-seven households. Now our cooperative has expanded to one hundred and forty-five households. With the development of production, the improvement of living standards, and the increase in the awareness of cooperative members, all our members are actively requesting to establish an advanced cooperative. In January of this year, with the help of the Party and the government, our cooperative officially transformed into a fully socialist agricultural production cooperative. Now, our cooperative has a total of sixty-five usable livestock, four rubber-tired carts, fourteen spoke-wheeled carts, two sets of new farm tools, two hundred and seventy hectares of paddy and dry land, and has accumulated more than 27,000 yuan of public property.

    In the six years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have deeply realized that only under the leadership of the Party and by following the path of cooperativization can we live the happiest life and escape the hardships of the past. From the day we established the cooperative, we felt we had strength. In recent years, we have not only overcome various natural disasters for three consecutive years and developed agricultural production, but also developed diversified economies, greatly increasing income. Because organizing saved a lot of labor and animal power, in the spring of the year we established the cooperative, we used more than five hundred man-days to cultivate one hectare and three mu of saplings, preparing to plant forests on the hills south of the village in the future. Our animal husbandry also began to develop from this year. We used the accumulated public accumulation fund and the investment of each cooperative member to buy more than thirty head of livestock. This not only developed livestock production, but also accumulated eight or nine hundred carts of manure each year to apply to the fields, making the crops grow very strong. In 1954, we also used surplus labor to dig more than 7,000 square meters of fish ponds. In the first year, we stocked more than 10,000 fish fry, and it is estimated that after three years, we can sell 10,000 jin of fish, which can generate an income of 2,500 yuan. This year, we also built a warm cellar of twenty-eight meters long and five meters wide, planting various vegetables to supply cities and industrial and mining areas, meeting the winter needs of workers for vegetables. We also grafted more than one hundred fruit tree seedlings (crabapple, apple, pear, etc.), and in a few years, we can produce a large number of fruits.

    In addition, we have also expanded the area of cultivated land and carried out basic land construction. During the thawing period last spring, we reclaimed two or three hectares of wasteland, built paddy fields, and converted five or six hectares of dry land into paddy fields, planting rice.

    With the continuous development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production, the consolidation and expansion of agricultural cooperatives, and the continuous increase in the income of cooperative members, our living standards have also greatly improved. Cooperative members have moved into new houses. Among the one hundred and forty-five cooperative member households in our cooperative, those whose lives are comparable to those of well-to-do middle peasants account for 22 percent. Only 17 percent of the cooperative members, because they joined the cooperative this year, have empty family foundations, weak labor, large populations, and severe famine, are still living a relatively poor life. Now, 85 percent of the cooperative members have an average of two sets of cotton clothes and robes. 62 percent of the cooperative members have sweaters, sanitary clothes, and woolen clothes. More than 80 percent of the cooperative members have put on new-style leather shoes. Now, in addition to sufficient wheat flour, rice, and other grains per month, each person can also eat an average of 2.6 liang of pork and seven eggs per month. We have also begun to stand up culturally. Now all the school-age children in our cooperative attend our own school. Young male and female cooperative members study at home in the morning. In the summer, as soon as the midday bell rings, you can see groups of three or five male and female cooperative members going to school. Some older ladies and gentlemen are not willing to lag behind, and follow behind the young men, carrying books into the farmers' spare-time school. Now, you simply can't find illiterate young people in our cooperative. Whenever we talk about our current lives, everyone has indescribable joy. Old cooperative member Niu Defang often says: "Our 'red-hot' days are getting more and more energetic, and I, an old man, am getting younger and younger!"

    Cooperative members are well aware that our good life today is the result of the Chinese Communist Party leading us on the path of cooperativization. Old production team leader Liang Naitang said: "Things that we couldn't dream of in the past have come true today." This is indeed the case. Since 1950, we have been using horse-drawn farm implements, and this year we have even used tractors to cultivate the land. If we hadn't organized, how could we have done this? When everyone mentions the happy life after taking the path of cooperativization, and thinks about the even better future prospects, they want to run their cooperative even better and produce more grain to support the country's industrial construction. At present, we must do a good job in this year's autumn harvest work in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. Now more than one hundred laborers have started harvesting. The harvesting is more meticulous than in previous years, achieving the goal of not leaving "horse ear stubble" when harvesting soybeans, and not pulling up the plants or losing the ears when harvesting rice. In order not to waste a grain of grain, we have formed three or forty women and children in the cooperative into a picking team, so that they can pick up grain as they harvest. We plan to save 12,000 jin of grain in the cooperative and sell 900,000 jin of grain to the state.

    For the further development of the cooperative, we have initially studied the development plan from next year to 1957. By 1957, our cooperative will expand to 250 households, with 420 hectares of cultivated land (including 400 hectares of grain crops), and the total grain output will reach more than 3.4 million jin, an increase of 16.44 percent compared to the planned output in 1955. In order to meet the needs of national construction for grain, we plan to develop 220 hectares of high-yield rice crops (accounting for 55 percent of the grain crop area), with an average yield of 9,500 jin per hectare. In terms of animal husbandry, excluding the livestock raised by cooperative members individually, the cooperative plans to raise 223 cattle, 60 horses, 270 pigs, and 2 dairy cows. In terms of aquaculture and fruit trees, we will raise 50,000 fish and plant 8,000 various fruit trees. In addition, we will continue to operate sideline businesses such as cutting oily grass bags, reeds, and transportation. The total income can increase by 44.5 percent compared to 1955. After completing this plan, the lives of all cooperative members will be better than they are now. The commercial grain supplied to the state will increase year by year, and a large amount of meat, eggs, and vegetables will also be supplied to the state. In this way, the income of our cooperative members will also increase year by year.

    With the development of cooperative production, the increase in cooperative member income, and the accumulation of public property, the material and cultural living standards of cooperative members will also improve and increase year by year. Within three years, we also plan to erect power lines and install electricity. In addition to using electricity for threshing, rice milling, and cutting grass, 50 percent of the cooperative members will have electric lights installed in their homes. In terms of cultural life, there are currently more than 100 primary school students, 20 middle school students, and 1 college student. By 1957, there will be 200 primary school students, 50 middle school students, and 10 college students.

    After this year's autumn harvest, we will educate the cooperative members to complete the above plan, so that everyone recognizes the great significance of completing this plan for the country and individuals, and consciously implement the plan. We believe that by 1957, our plan will be successfully completed.

    我们在农业合作化的道路上前进
    吉林省幸福之路农业生产合作社主任　韩恩
    中华人民共和国建国六周年的国庆节来到了。我们幸福之路农业生产合作社全体社员以万分兴奋的心情，来迎接这个伟大的节日。
    建国六年来，随着祖国生产的恢复和发展，千百万个农民都按照我们伟大领袖毛主席所指示的“组织起来”的道路，积极参加了各种类型的互助合作组织。这使我国农业生产大大地发展了。我们吉林省蛟河县保安屯的农民，也和千百万农民一样，走着组织起来的道路。现在我们已经从互助组发展到完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。我们的生产也大大发展了。中华人民共和国成立的那年，我们仅仅是个二十几户的互助组。一九五二年春天，在党和政府的帮助下，我们正式成立了二十四户的半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社。当时只有四十多垧地，二十四头牲口，四辆花轱辘车。这一年，我们的生产便进了一大步：比互助组时多上了粪，改良了十五垧地的土壤，庄稼比往年侍弄得及时，也长得格外好。这年虽然遭到了一场严重的雹灾，可是经过我们全体社员积极抢救，追施了四千多斤肥料，秋天仍然获得从来没有过的大丰收。我们全社每垧地平均打粮比同样受灾的农民多打了粮食一倍多，比一九四九年互助组时也多打了一倍多，比解放前多打了两倍半。这年每个劳动日分了五十一斤粮。看牛的社员徐凤山分得十四石粮，比在互助组时多收入了一倍。中农社员常守贵爷儿俩个过去在互助组的时候，一年累死累活才收入二十多石粮，入社后收入了四十九石。社外农民看到了这些事实，都叨咕着：还得说农业合作社的力量大，叫我们互助组摊上这场雹灾，可就真的打完蛋了。一九五三年春天，没等开犁种地，我们就买进了二十二匹膘肥大马，七头大牛和四辆崭新的胶皮车。这年农业生产每垧地比上年增产四百五十斤粮食，总共增产一万五千七百五十斤粮食。副业收入比上年增加了百分之三十。到了这年年底，我们就积累了一万多元的公共财产。由于我们农业合作社增产多，收入多，在我们附近几个屯子里的农民都说：参加社富的更富，穷的也富裕起来了。就在一九五三年的秋天，不等我们打完场，天天就有很多附近屯的农民来要求入社。有的人还远从外县外区搬来，要求参加社。到了冬天，我们社就扩大到了四十七户。现在我们社已扩大到一百四十五户。随着生产的发展，生活的改善和社员觉悟的提高，我们全体社员都积极要求办高级社。今年一月间，在党和政府的帮助下，我们的社就正式转为完全社会主义性质的农业生产合作社了。现在，我们全社共有能使的牲口六十五头，胶皮车四辆，花轱辘车十四辆，新农具两套，水旱田二百七十垧，还积累了二万七千多元钱的公共财产。
    建国六年来，我们深深地体会到，只有在党的领导下，走合作化的道路，才能过上最幸福的生活，才能摆脱过去的苦难日子。从我们成立了社的那天起，我们就感到有了力量。这几年来，我们不仅一连三年战胜了各种自然灾害，发展了农业生产，同时还发展了多种经济，大大增加了收入。由于组织起来节省了不少劳力、畜力，我们在成立社的那年春天，就用了五百多个人工栽培了一垧三亩地的树苗，准备将来在屯南的山岗上造林。我们的畜牧业也就从这年开始有了发展。我们用积累的公积金和各户社员的投资，买了三十多头牲畜。这样，不仅发展了牧畜业生产，而且每年多积了八、九百车粪上到地里，使庄稼长得十分粗壮。一九五四年，我们还利用剩余劳力，挖了七千多平方公尺的养鱼池。头一年就放养了一万多条鱼苗，估计三年后就可以卖一万斤鱼，能收入二千五百元。这一年我们又修了长二十八公尺、宽五公尺的暖窖，种植了各样的蔬菜，供应城市和工矿区，满足工人们冬季对菜蔬的需要。我们还接成了一百多棵果树苗（海棠、苹果、梨等），几年之后，就可出产大批水果。
    此外，我们还扩大了耕地面积和进行土地的基本建设。去年春天的化冻期间，开了生荒二、三垧，修成了水田，又把五、六垧旱地改成了水田，种了水稻。
    随着农、林、牧业和副业生产的不断发展，农业合作社的巩固壮大，社员收入的不断增加，现在我们的生活水平也大大提高和改善了。社员们都住上了新房子。我们社的一百四十五户社员中，生活赶得上富裕中农生活的占百分之二十二，只有百分之十七的社员，因为是今年新入社，家底子空，劳力弱，人口多，饥荒大，还在过着比较贫困的生活。现在，百分之八十五的社员平均每人有两套棉衣和大袍。有百分之六十二的社员有毛衣、卫生衣、呢料子衣服。有百分之八十以上的社员都穿上了新式皮鞋。现在，每人每月除有足够的白面大米等粮食以外，平均每人每月还可以吃到猪肉二斤六两、鸡蛋七个。我们在文化上也开始翻身了。现在我们全社一百多个适龄儿童都上了自己的学校。青年男女社员们在家上午学。在夏季，只要午间钟一响，就可以看到三人一伙，五人一群的男女社员上学校去。有些上岁数的老太太和老头，也都不甘落后，跟在小伙子们的后头，夹着书本走进农民业余学校。现在，不识字的青年人，在我们合作社里，就根本找不到了。只要一谈起我们现在的生活，大家都有说不出来的喜悦。老社员牛德芳常说：“咱们‘火炭红’的日子越过越有劲，我这老头子可越活越年轻了！”
    社员们都清楚地知道，我们今天的生活这样好，是中国共产党领导我们走合作化道路的结果。老生产队长梁乃堂说：“我们过去梦想不到的事，今天都实现了。”的确是这样的。打从一九五零年起我们就使上了马拉农具，今年还使上了拖拉机种地。要不是组织起来，哪能做到这一步呢？大家提起走合作化道路以后的幸福生活，想到将来更美好的远景，就更想把自己的社办得更好，要生产出更多的粮食来支援国家的工业建设。目前，我们要根据增产节约的精神，全力做好今年秋收工作。现在一百多个劳力已在开始收割。割的都比往年细致，做到了割大豆不留“马耳朵槎”，割稻子不拉棵、不丢穗。为了不糟蹋一粒粮食，我们并把全社的三、四十个妇女儿童组成了拣庄稼组，做到随割随拣。我们计划全社要节约粮食一万二千斤，把九十万斤粮食卖给国家。
    为了社的进一步发展，我们已初步研究出从明年到一九五七年的发展计划。到一九五七年，我们社要扩大到二百五十户，耕地达到四百二十垧（其中粮食作物面积达到四百垧），粮食总产量要达到三百四十多万斤，比一九五五年计划产量增长百分之十六点四四。为了适应国家建设对于粮食的需要，计划发展高产作物水稻二百二十垧（占粮食作物面积百分之五十五），每垧平均产量达九千五百斤，牧畜业除社员个人饲养的不算，社内计划养牛二百二十三头，马六十匹，猪二百七十口，奶牛两头。在水产果树方面，养鱼五万条，栽植各种果树八千棵。另外，还继续经营割油包草、苇子和运输等副业。总计收入可比一九五五年增长百分之四十四点五。完成这个计划以后，全社社员生活将比现在更加美好。供给国家的商品粮食将逐年增加，同时还将供给国家大批的肉类、鸡蛋和蔬菜。这样，我们社员的收入也将逐年增加。
    随着合作社生产的发展，社员收入的增加，公共财产的积累，社员们的物质文化生活水平也将逐年改善和提高。在三年内，我们还准备架设电线，按上电力，除引用电力脱谷碾米，铡草等外，将有百分之五十的社员家里安上电灯。在文化生活方面，现有小学学生一百多人，中学学生二十名，大学生一名。到一九五七年，小学生将达到二百名，中学生达到五十名，大学生十名。
    今年秋收以后，我们即将对社员进行完成上述计划的教育，让大家认识到完成这个计划对国家和个人的重大意义，自觉地来执行计划。我们相信，到一九五七年，我们的计划将能胜利完成。
