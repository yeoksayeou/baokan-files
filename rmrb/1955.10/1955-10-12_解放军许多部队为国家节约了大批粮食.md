Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), after studying the state's grain policy, have saved large quantities of grain for the state.

	Grain stations, kitchens, and mess halls of PLA units on the Fujian front are plastered with slogans such as "Saving grain is everyone's responsibility." Many units or individuals have established "Pledges for Protecting and Saving Grain." All grain storage and supply departments strictly compile grain consumption plans for the troops for each period. Warehouse managers have strengthened their work in preventing rats, dampness, insects, and mold. Cooks, in addition to paying attention to not spilling rice and flour during work, also actively improve cooking methods. A certain unit's cooking squad, by improving cooking methods, has saved more than 2,000 jin of rice in more than half a year. Cooks at a certain hospital have been measuring rice according to the number of people since January, and nurses give only as much as patients can eat. So far, they have saved 40,000 jin of grain.

	Food service units of the PLA units stationed in Lanzhou universally pay attention to improving grain storage, establish strict registration systems for grain use, and ensure "fixed quantities per person, weighed before cooking." A certain company and a certain motor vehicle unit implement scientific management methods for stored grain. For more than half a year, there have been no instances of rat bites or dampness and mold in the grain. The grain management staff of a certain hospital conducted specific experiments in the kitchen for more than a week to improve the accuracy of grain planning. Since August, the accuracy of the grain plan implementation has reached over 97%.

	An officers' mess hall of a certain PLA unit stationed in Guangzhou has saved more than 4,000 jin of grain for the state in the past five months. The staff of this officers' mess hall accurately receive grain according to actual consumption, avoiding stockpiling, and carefully check the grain containers for holes and cracks, eliminating losses of grain during transportation and storage. The cooks carefully control the time the rice goes into the pot and maintain the temperature of the stove, making the cooked rice fragrant, soft, and free of scorched rice. The officers who come to the mess hall for meals also buy rice according to their appetite, leaving no leftovers.

    解放军许多部队为国家节约了大批粮食
    新华社十一日讯　中国人民解放军许多部队学习了国家的粮食政策后，为国家节约了大批粮食。
    福建前线中国人民解放军各部队的粮站、伙房和食堂里，到处贴着“节约粮食，人人有责”等标语，许多单位或个人订了“爱护和节约粮食公约”；所有粮食保管和供给部门，都严格编制了每一时期部队的用粮计划。仓库管理人员加强了防鼠、防潮、防虫和防霉烂的工作。炊事人员除在工作中注意不抛撒米面外，还积极改进做饭方法。某部炊事班由于改进了煮饭方法，半年多来节约大米两千多斤。某医院的炊事人员们自一月份开始在煮饭时按人定量下米，护士们也根据病人能吃多少，就给多少，到目前为止，他们已节约粮食四万斤。
    中国人民解放军驻兰州部队的各伙食单位普遍注意改进粮食的保管工作，在用粮方面建立了严格的登记制度，做到“按人定量、过秤下锅”。某连和某汽车部队对库存粮食实行科学管理方法，半年多来粮食没有发生鼠咬和潮湿霉烂的现象。某部医院管理粮食的工作人员为了提高粮食计划的准确性，在伙房作了一个多星期的具体试验。从八月份以来，实施粮食计划的准确性已达到百分之九十七以上。
    中国人民解放军驻广州某部的一个军官食堂，最近五个月来共为国家节约了四千多斤粮食。这个军官食堂的工作人员根据实际用量准确地领取粮食，避免造成积压，并仔细地检查载粮用具有无破洞和裂缝，杜绝了粮食在搬运和储放期间的损耗。炊事员细心地掌握米下锅的时间和保持炉火的温度，使做出的饭又香又软，而且没有锅巴。到这个食堂来用饭的军官，也都根据自己的食量购买米饭，不使有剩饭。
