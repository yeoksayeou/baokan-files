A mechanized coal mine – Nanping Adit – is under construction in the state-owned Zixing Coal Mine in Hunan Province. The construction project officially commenced in late September. Currently, earthwork is proceeding intensely on the surface, and tunneling will begin in early November.

This mine is one of the key construction projects of the national coal mining industry. Its main production processes are entirely mechanized. Coal cutting machines are used to mine coal at the underground working face; pneumatic drills and electric drills are used for tunneling in the roadways, and rock loaders are used to load rock; coal and gangue are transported by trolley wire electric locomotives. After completion, the overall underground production efficiency will increase three to three and a half times compared to the present; coal production will increase by one time compared to the present. The mine's safety protection equipment is very good, with waterproof pipes, rock dust shelves to prevent explosions, and many other explosion-proof electrical equipment underground.

The coalfield of this mine is close to the surface, making it easy to mine, and it has abundant reserves that can be mined for decades. The coal quality is excellent and is most suitable for coking. After this mine is completed and put into formal production, it will mainly support the production of steel joint enterprises such as Wuhan Iron and Steel Company.

    湖南兴建一座机械化矿井
    湖南省国营资兴煤矿正在兴建一座机械化矿井——南平硐，建设工程已于九月下旬正式开工。目前，地面上土石方工程正在紧张进行，掘进工程也将于十一月初开始。
    这座矿井是国家煤矿工业重要建设项目中的一个。它的主要生产过程全部是机械化的。井下工作面是用割煤机采煤；巷道用风钻和电钻掘进，用装岩机装岩；煤碳和矸石用驾线式电机车运输。建成后整个井下的生产效率将比现在提高三倍到三倍半；产煤量将比现在增加一倍。矿井的安全防护设备很好，井下有防水管、防止爆炸的岩粉棚，以及其他许多电气防爆设备。
    这座矿井的煤田距地面较近，开采方便，而且蕴藏量丰富，可以开采数十年。煤质优良，最适于炼焦，这座矿井建成并正式生产后，将主要支援武汉钢铁公司等钢铁联合企业的生产。
