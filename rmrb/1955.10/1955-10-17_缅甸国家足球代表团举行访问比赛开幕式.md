After the start of the match, the Beijing team immediately adopted a comprehensive offensive, getting five or six shooting opportunities in the first ten minutes, but did not score.

The Beijing team scored first. At the fifteenth minute, a melee broke out between the players of both sides about two meters in front of the Burmese team's goal, and the Burmese team's goalkeeper skillfully saved the ball. The Beijing team, which is good at using short passes, constantly pressed into the Burmese team's penalty area. At the twenty-second minute, the right forward passed the ball long to the left forward, who immediately raised his foot and hit the shot, and the score on the field was two to zero, with the Beijing team leading. After that, the Burmese team also launched several offensives, but the ball was blocked by the Beijing team's center back and defenders. In the fierce battle, the Burmese team's defenders and goalkeepers saved many dangerous balls and were unanimously praised by the audience. By the thirty-fourth minute, the Beijing team's forward scored a goal. Until the end of the first half, the Beijing team still led by three to zero.

Less than a minute after the start of the second half, the Beijing team's forward scored a goal. Although the Burmese team lost four points in a row, their offensive did not weaken. They used the method of long passes to make the forwards threaten the Beijing team's goal several times. The Burmese team's forwards ran fast, and their dribbling and ball control were also steady, and they crossed the Beijing team's defenders several times to shoot in the penalty area. In the twenty-fifth and twenty-seventh minutes, the Burmese team scored two points in a row, and the score became four to two.
