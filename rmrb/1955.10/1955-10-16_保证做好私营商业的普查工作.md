To guarantee the success of the national private commerce and catering industry census, under the direct leadership of local Party and government departments, the work has now been generally deployed to the grassroots units. In most areas, pilot work and cadre training have been completed, and a comprehensive census has already begun or is about to begin. Based on the recent experiences of pilot work in various regions, to ensure the success of this census and guarantee that the information obtained is true and reliable, the following two things must be done effectively.

First, we must do a good job in publicity and mobilization to eliminate various ideological concerns of private businesses. As everyone knows, it is the first time in our history to conduct such a large-scale national census of private commerce and the catering industry. The census targets millions of small merchants and vendors, as well as a considerable number of capitalists. Their understanding of this census work is generally vague, and they have many incorrect ideas and concerns. For example, some people worry that the census will lead to "mergers and joint operations," some fear that after the census, "business will be difficult to do, and it will be difficult to change careers," some fear that their business situation will be clarified by the government, and their future business will be restricted, and some people try to ask the government to solve all their difficulties through the census, etc. Therefore, we must fully carry out publicity and mobilization work, explain the purpose and significance of the census clearly, and eliminate their various incorrect ideas and concerns. Only in this way can the census work proceed smoothly.

What should we publicize to private businesses? We should focus on explaining that this census is a necessary and important measure for the country to carry out the socialist transformation of private commerce and the catering industry during the transition period, which is beneficial to both the country and the private commerce and catering industry operators themselves. All patriotic and law-abiding private commerce and catering industry operators should truthfully report their actual business situation to the country according to the contents and requirements of the census form prescribed by the state to ensure the successful completion of the census work. As everyone knows, on the basis of socialist industrialization, gradually transforming private commerce according to socialist principles is one of the great historical tasks that the Chinese people must realize during the transition period. The First Five-Year Plan specifically stipulated that within five years, capitalist commerce should be basically brought into the orbit of various forms of state capitalism; at the same time, private commerce with the nature of independent laborers must be gradually organized through various forms of cooperation to establish a basis for the socialist transformation of private commerce. That is to say, to build a socialist society in our country and ensure that our national economy can develop in a planned and proportionate manner along the socialist road, we must carry out socialist transformation of private commerce through various different forms so that their activities are gradually brought into the orbit of the national plan. To complete such a great historical task, the state has many specific tasks to do, one of the most important of which is to investigate and understand the basic situation of private commerce and the catering industry in various regions across the country. If the state does not know how many households there are in the national private commerce and catering industry, how many employees there are, and how much business is done in a year, it will not be possible to formulate specific arrangements, transformation plans and steps.

In recent years, various regions and departments concerned have done a lot of investigation and statistical work on private commerce and the catering industry, and have achieved considerable results, but analyzing from the data currently available, it is not only not comprehensive and accurate, but also the scope, calculation methods, and classification principles included in the data of various departments are very inconsistent, and cannot meet the requirements of comprehensive arrangement and transformation of private commerce and the catering industry. Therefore, the State Council decided to conduct a census of the basic situation of private commerce and the catering industry throughout the country in September and October this year.

From the perspective of private commerce and catering industry operators, this census is beneficial to them. As mentioned above, since the purpose of this census is for the country to better and more systematically arrange and transform private commerce and the catering industry, and honestly accepting the socialist transformation of the state is precisely the bright future of all private commerce and catering industry operators, then it should be said that it is very beneficial for them to report their actual business situation to the country through the census. We only need to point out the following points. For example, in order to arrange and transform private retailers so that they can continue to serve the expansion of urban and rural commodity circulation and meet the needs of the people's lives under the leadership of state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives, each city and market town will determine a ratio of public and private retail sales based on the local situation and according to the industry, which can stabilize market prices and maintain the operation of private businesses, and try to stabilize this ratio of public and private ownership for a period of time, so that it is possible to make appropriate arrangements for the employees of private commerce and facilitate the socialist transformation of private commerce industry by industry. However, to implement this correct and timely measure of the state, if the state does not understand the number of employees in private commerce and the commodity sales and income of various regions and industries, it is obviously not possible. Furthermore, as the socialist economy grows stronger, the planning of the entire national economy is increasingly strengthened. At present, the source of many important commodities has been entirely or largely controlled by the state. If the business activities of private commerce are not gradually brought into the orbit of the national plan, many difficulties will arise. If private commerce does not report its actual business situation to the state, certain difficulties will also arise in the reasonable allocation of goods by the state. It is precisely in order to better implement the policy of "overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement" that the state decided to conduct a national census of private commerce and the catering industry. Therefore, this census is beneficial to both the country and private commerce and catering industry operators. Personnel participating in the census work in various regions should explain the purpose and important significance of this census with specific examples according to the local situation, educate the broad masses of private commerce and catering industry operators to actively support this census work, dispel various unnecessary ideological concerns, and earnestly and honestly report the true situation of their stores to the country to ensure the successful completion of the census work.

Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the verification of census data. It is by no means easy to get capitalists to truthfully report their business situation without any struggle. Therefore, in addition to explaining to the capitalists the state's policy of arrangement and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and the purpose and significance of this census, and educating them to truthfully report their business situation, we must also fully rely on and mobilize the broad masses of shop assistants and workers, mobilize them to actively help the government do a good job in this census work, and strictly supervise the capitalists to fill in the forms truthfully. As for the vast number of small merchants and vendors, we must also enlighten their class consciousness from all aspects and educate them to report truthfully. The Private Business Census Office of Dongsi District, Beijing, recently conducted a detailed sample survey of all the indicators on the census forms reported by 59 private businesses under the direct leadership of the district's responsible personnel. As a result, there were problems with 38 households, accounting for 64.4 percent of the total number of households surveyed, and 53 problems of various sizes were found. Analyzing the reasons, in addition to a very small number of cases where the private businesses filled in the forms incorrectly due to our lack of specific explanations and assistance during the publication, the vast majority of them were due to the capitalists' intentional concealment and false reporting. Similar situations also exist in other regions. For example, when filling in the number of employees, some capitalists not only fill in children, wives, and parents who do not engage in commercial activities at all, but even count deceased personnel and relatives living hundreds of miles away as employees in the store, and said: "Let the government take care of these poor relatives," intentionally undermining the census work. Some capitalists deliberately provoke the relationship between shop assistants and workers and the government. They said to the shop assistants: "If you actively calculate the accounts, the government will not give you a share," and threatened the shop assistants to "take care of your job," attempting to obstruct the active reporting and strict supervision of the shop assistants and workers and resist the census work. Therefore, we must be vigilant, earnestly strengthen the verification of census data, and conduct serious struggles against all elements who conceal, falsely report, intentionally sabotage, and resist the census work.

According to the experience of pilot projects in various regions, among the five indicators in the census forms filled in by private businesses, the most errors are in the "number of employees" and "commodity sales." After hearing that the government will make further arrangements for private commerce and the catering industry in various industries after this census, they intentionally exaggerate the number of employees in their stores and conceal the true commodity sales, attempting to evade taxes and use this to trick the government into giving them more care. Some people deliberately falsely report past commodity sales, attempting to take advantage of more advantages when the state allocates goods and arranges business volume in the future, and want to take advantage of this census. Some people also deliberately conceal the amount of capital, attempting to withdraw funds and resist the transformation in the future. Therefore, in addition to timely exposing the illegal acts of private businesses in speculation and conducting necessary education and struggles, we must also conduct a detailed and strict review of each item in the report submitted by private businesses. If errors are found, they must be changed and corrected immediately. In the process of verifying the census forms, it is not only necessary to organize a considerable number of capable staff and obtain the close cooperation of relevant business departments such as taxation and industrial and commercial administration departments, but also to fully rely on the broad masses of shop assistants and workers to conduct a careful, serious and comprehensive review. Facts have proved that as long as shop assistants and workers are mobilized and their awareness is raised, any concealment and false reporting by capitalists can be found out. In addition, after receiving the census forms filled in by private businesses, various regions should select a portion of merchants as far as possible to conduct focused re-examination in order to discover problems in a timely manner, summarize experiences, and study solutions.

Doing a good job in the verification of census forms is an important key to ensuring that the data obtained in this census is true and reliable. Census workers in various regions must firmly grasp this link, and any practice of being careless and submitting reports without strict verification must be resolutely opposed.

    保证做好私营商业的普查工作
    杨波
    全国私营商业和饮食业的普查工作，在各地党政部门直接领导下，现已普遍布置到基层单位，大部分地区的试点工作和干部训练工作已经结束，全面的普查已经或即将开始。根据最近各地试点工作的经验，要做好这次普查工作，保证普查所得的资料真实可靠，必须切实做好以下两件事情。
    首先，要做好宣传动员工作，消除私商的各种思想顾虑。大家知道，进行这样全国性的大规模的私营商业和饮食业的普查工作，在我国历史上还是第一次。普查的对象有几百万小商小贩，还有为数很多的资本家，他们对这次普查工作的认识一般是很模糊的，并有许多不正确的想法和顾虑。如有的人顾虑普查后会“并店、联营”，有的怕普查后
  “生意不好做，不好转业”，有的怕自己的经营情况被政府查清后，今后营业会受到限制，也有部分人则企图通过普查要求政府解决他的一切困难等等。因之我们必须充分做好宣传动员工作，把普查的目的和意义讲解清楚，消除他们的各种不正确想法和顾虑。只有这样，才能使普查工作顺利进行。
    要向私商宣传些什么呢？应着重说明：这次普查是过渡时期国家对私营商业和饮食业进行社会主义改造的一项必要的重要的措施，不论对国家或对私营商业和饮食业者自己都有好处。一切爱国守法的私营商业和饮食业者都应该根据国家规定的普查表的内容和要求，老老实实地把自己经营的真实情况向国家报告清楚，保证普查工作的圆满完成。大家知道，在社会主义工业化的基础上，按照社会主义的原则来逐步地改造私营商业，是我国人民在过渡时期中必须实现的伟大历史任务之一。第一个五年计划中曾具体规定：要在五年内基本上把资本主义商业分别纳入各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道；同时又必须用不同的合作形式分别把独立劳动者性质的私营商业逐步地组织起来，建立对私营商业的社会主义改造的基础。这就是说，要在我国建成社会主义社会，保证我国国民经济能够有计划、按比例地沿着社会主义的道路发展，就必须对私营商业分别地通过各种不同的形式进行社会主义改造，使他们的活动逐步纳入国家计划的轨道。要完成这样一个伟大的历史任务，国家要做的具体工作是很多的，其中很重要的一项，就是要把全国各地区的私营商业和饮食业的基本情况调查了解清楚。如果国家不了解全国的私营商业和饮食业究竟有多少户数，有多少从业人员，一年做多少钱的买卖等基本情况，就不可能定出具体安排、改造计划和步骤。
    几年来，各地区、各有关部门对私营商业和饮食业虽已做了不少的调查统计工作，也取得了相当的成绩，但就现已掌握的资料来分析，不但不全面，准确性很差，而且各部门资料包括的范围、计算方法、分类原则等也很不一致，不能适合对私营商业和饮食业进行全面安排、改造的要求。因此，国务院才决定在今年九、十月间在全国范围内进行一次私营商业和饮食业基本情况的普查工作。
    从私营商业和饮食业者方面讲，这次普查对他们是有好处的。上面讲过，既然这次普查的目的是在于国家能够更好地、更有计划有步骤地对私营商业和饮食业进行安排、改造工作，而老老实实地接受国家的社会主义改造，又正是一切私营商业和饮食业者的光明前途，那末，应该说，通过普查把自己经营的真实情况向国家报告清楚，对他们的好处是很多的。我们只要指出以下几点就够了。例如国家为了安排和改造私营零售商，使他们能够在国营商业和供销合作社的领导下，继续为扩大城乡商品流转、满足人民生活需要服务，各个城市、集镇将根据当地情况，按照行业定出一个既能够稳定市场物价、又能够维持私商经营的关于零售额方面的公私比重，并尽可能地使这种公私比重稳定一个时期，以便有可能对私营商业的从业人员作适当的安排，并便于逐行逐业地对私营商业实行社会主义改造。可是要贯彻执行国家这一正确的适时的措施，如果国家不了解各地区各行业私营商业的从业人员数和商品销售额、收益额等基本情况，显然是不行的。再如随着社会主义经济的日益壮大，整个国民经济的计划性日益加强。目前许多重要商品货源已经全部或大部分为国家所掌握，私营商业的经营活动如不逐步纳入国家计划的轨道，就会发生许多困难。私营商业如不把自己经营的真实情况向国家报告清楚，国家在货源的合理分配方面，也会发生一定的困难。正是为了更好地贯彻执行“统筹兼顾，全面安排”的方针，所以国家才决定进行一次全国私营商业和饮食业普查工作。因之这次普查不论对国家或对私营商业和饮食业者，都是有好处的。各地参加普查工作的人员，应根据当地的情况，以具体事例说明这次普查的目的和重要意义，教育广大私营商业和饮食业者积极拥护这次普查工作，解除各种不必要的思想顾虑，认真地、老老实实地把自己店内的真实情况向国家报告清楚，保证普查工作任务的圆满完成。
    其次，要加强普查资料的审核工作。要叫资本家把他们的营业情况据实报告清楚，绝不是一件容易的不经过任何斗争就能办到的事情。因此，除了向资本家讲清楚国家对资本主义工商业安排改造的政策和这次普查的目的和意义，教育他们要老实报告营业情况以外，还必须充分依靠和发动广大店员职工，动员他们积极帮助政府做好这次普查工作，严格监督资本家据实填报。至于对广大的小商小贩，也要从各方面去启发他们的阶级觉悟，教育他们据实报告。北京市东四区私商普查办公室，最近在区的负责人员直接领导下，详细抽查了五十九户私商所报普查表的全部指标，结果有三十八户有问题，占抽查总户数的百分之六四·四，查出大小问题五十三个。分析原因，除极少数是由于我们在发表时缺乏具体的讲解和帮助，致使私商不明了填写方法而填错外，绝大部分是因为资本家有意隐瞒、假报。其他地区类似的情况也是有的。如有的资本家在填报从业人员时，不但把根本不从事商业活动的小孩、老婆、父母等填上，甚至把已经死了的人员和居住在几百里路以外的亲戚也算作店内的从业人员，并说：“让政府把这些穷亲穷戚都包下去”，有意破坏普查工作。有的资本家则故意挑拨店员职工同政府的关系，他们向店员说：“积极算账，政府不会分给你一份”，恐吓店员“要顾住饭碗”，企图以此来阻挠店员职工的积极检举和严格监督，抗拒普查工作。因之，我们必须提高警惕，切实加强普查资料的审核工作，并同一切隐瞒、假报，故意破坏、抗拒普查工作的分子进行严肃的斗争。
    根据各地试点的经验，私商在填报普查表的五个指标中，错误最多的是“从业人员”和“商品销售额”两项。他们听说这次普查后政府将对各个行业的私营商业和饮食业作进一步的安排，就有意夸大自己店内的从业人员数，隐瞒真实的商品销售额，企图偷漏税收，并以此来骗取政府对他们更多的照顾。有的人则故意谎报过去的商品销售额，企图在今后国家分配货源和安排营业额时，自己多占一些便宜，想借这次普查捞一把。也有的人故意隐瞒资本额，企图在以后抽走资金，抗拒改造。因之，我们除应及时揭发私商投机取巧的不法行为，进行必要的教育和斗争外，还必须对私商填报的报表的每一项进行详细的严格的审核，发现错误立即要他更改修正。在审核普查表的过程中，不仅必须组织相当数量的得力工作人员，取得各有关业务部门如税务、工商行政管理等部门的密切配合，并且必须充分依靠广大店员职工进行仔细、认真地全面审查。事实证明，只要店员职工发动起来了，觉悟提高了，资本家任何隐瞒假报都是可以查清的。此外，各地在收到私商填报的普查表之后，应尽可能选择一部分商户，有重点地进行复查，以便及时发现问题，总结经验，研究解决的办法。
    做好普查表的审核工作，是保证这次普查所得资料真实可靠的重要关键。各地普查工作人员要切实抓紧这一环节，任何马虎从事，不经严格审核即行汇总上报的做法，都要坚决反对。
