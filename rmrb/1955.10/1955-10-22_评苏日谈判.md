Commenting on the Soviet-Japanese Negotiations
    Jiang Yuanchun

The negotiations between the Soviet and Japanese governments on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations have been underway in London since June 3rd, lasting for more than four months. Due to the obviously delaying tactics adopted by the Japanese side, the negotiations have not yielded any results even after such a long period. On September 21st, the Soviet-Japanese negotiations were announced to be temporarily suspended. The Japanese negotiator, Shunichi Matsumoto, has returned to Japan to consult with the Japanese government on the future of the negotiations. As pointed out by Kyodo News' London correspondent, the "success or failure of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations from now on depends solely on what the Japanese government intends to do."

The normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations is not only the urgent desire of the Japanese people but also a matter of close concern to peace-loving people in Asia and around the world.

Ten years have passed since the end of World War II, and due to the political situation in Japan under long-term American occupation, the state of war between Japan and its two major neighbors, China and the Soviet Union, has not yet ended. This situation is only beneficial to those who seek to turn Japan into a military base hostile to China and the Soviet Union. For the Japanese people, the continued existence of this situation means great danger and hinders the restoration of Japan's traditional economic and cultural ties with these two major neighbors, deepening the suffering of the Japanese people.

Therefore, the Japanese people universally demand the restoration of normal relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, and this demand has been increasing with the initiatives taken by the Soviet Union and China on this issue. As early as 1953, the Soviet Union explicitly expressed its willingness to restore normal relations with Japan. The joint declaration on relations with Japan issued by China and the Soviet Union on October 12, 1954, aroused a huge response in Japan, further developing the Japanese people's movement to strive for the restoration of normal Sino-Japanese and Soviet-Japanese relations.

Under these circumstances, the Hatoyama government, which succeeded the Yoshida government, expressed its willingness to strive for the restoration of normal relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, starting with relations with the Soviet Union. The Foreign Minister of the Hatoyama government, Mamoru Shigemitsu, specifically stated on December 11, 1954, that Japan was willing to restore relations with the Soviet Union and China under mutually acceptable conditions. Hatoyama himself repeatedly stated during the Japanese general election at the beginning of this year that: "Adjusting Soviet-Japanese relations is the demand of the entire nation"; "Normalizing Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union is the road to world peace."

For the benefit of the Soviet and Japanese people, the Soviet government took the initiative to propose negotiations with Japan on the restoration of normal relations. With the efforts of the Soviet Union, after resolving the differences regarding the location of the negotiations, the Soviet-Japanese negotiations finally began. The holding of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations not only conformed to the wishes of the Japanese people but also to the interests of Asian peace, and therefore received the welcome and attention of people around the world.

However, even before the Soviet-Japanese negotiations began, it was already very clear that certain forces in the international arena and within Japan were hostile to the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations. In order to obstruct the success of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, they exerted strong pressure on the Japanese government from all sides. Kyodo News clearly pointed out who these forces were in a commentary in early June. Kyodo News pointed out that "the mere fact that Japan and the Soviet Union have begun negotiations has made the Japanese people reveal a bright expression as if they have moved slightly away from the whirlpool of the 'Cold War'... For the leaders of the United States, these are by no means gratifying." As a reflection of this American sentiment within Japan, certain Japanese political parties have tried their best to obstruct the success of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, arguing that the issues of the repatriation of Japanese war criminals, fisheries, and the so-called territorial issues must be resolved first, "otherwise, diplomatic relations should not be restored," and therefore disagreeing with holding Soviet-Japanese negotiations.

Obviously, if the Hatoyama government respected the wishes of the Japanese people, fulfilled its promises during the general election, pursued an independent foreign policy, and resisted the interference of these forces that disregarded the interests of the Japanese people, then the Soviet-Japanese negotiations would have all the conditions to quickly achieve success, creating a good start for the restoration of normal Soviet-Japanese relations.

The Soviet Union adopted a reasonable and respectful attitude towards the negotiating partner in the negotiations. The Soviet Union believes that the state of war must be ended first, and the past wars and conflicts between the Soviet Union and Japan should not be investigated. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan and the exchange of envoys, negotiations on various issues between the two countries should be conducted through normal diplomatic channels on the basis of mutual benefit. Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama refuted the arguments against Soviet-Japanese negotiations in January, pointing out that resolving various issues between Japan and the Soviet Union after the restoration of diplomatic relations is "a principle in diplomacy." He believes that the arguments of those who oppose Soviet-Japanese negotiations are "putting the cart before the horse." This fully proves the correctness of the Soviet Union's attitude. Under these circumstances, the smooth progress of the negotiations should not be a problem. The experience of the Soviet Union's negotiations with West Germany proves that as long as both sides show the same concern and willingness to establish normal relations, the problem can be resolved satisfactorily within a few days.

However, surprisingly, the Japanese diplomatic authorities abandoned the position stated by Prime Minister Hatoyama during the specific negotiations and adopted an attitude of putting the cart before the horse. Japan insisted on resolving the issues of the repatriation of Japanese war criminals and the so-called territorial issues as preconditions for the restoration of normal relations between the two countries, thus giving the impression that the Japanese side did not actually want to end the state of war between Japan and the Soviet Union, and therefore was not interested in the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations, and deliberately put forward some unacceptable preconditions to delay the negotiations. Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu also deliberately violated the agreement that the negotiations should be conducted in secret shortly after the start of the negotiations, unilaterally revealing meeting content that was inconsistent with the facts, creating an atmosphere of hostility towards the Soviet Union in the country, and shifting the obstacles to the negotiations to the Soviet Union. He also said that this was to "avoid the loss of direction of public opinion" and "not an act of diplomatic betrayal." Shigemitsu's attitude was clearly instigated and encouraged by the United States. International News Service reported that American officials believed that Japan was "doing it very cleverly." They also said that if Japan agreed to sign a peace treaty and normalize diplomatic relations before all issues were resolved, it "would lose its only strength," in other words, it would lose the opportunity to obstruct the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations.

Despite the Soviet Union's efforts in the negotiations, Japan still maintained a rigid attitude, which led to a long delay in the negotiations. In the words of Japanese journalists in London, "On the Soviet side, there is evidence that they will try to instill the spirit of the Geneva Conference into the London negotiations," while "on the Japanese side, the negotiations with the Soviet Union are entirely a situation of delaying time, and each meeting revolves around the same issue." Obviously, the Japanese diplomatic authorities should bear full responsibility for the delay and lack of progress in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations.

As early as late July, a reporter from Kyodo News in Japan pointed out in a commentary on the Soviet-Japanese negotiations that "the most important thing for the Japanese side is to see the current international situation clearly." This is completely correct. The failure of the American "policy of strength" and the relaxation of the international situation have been welcomed by the Japanese people and Japanese patriotic forces. To correctly see this situation and think for the benefit of Japan, Japanese politicians can only improve Japan's international status and ensure Japan's peace and security by establishing and developing friendly relations with all countries, especially with its close neighbors, the Soviet Union and China. Today, still wanting to closely follow the United States, obeying everything, and trying to rely on the United States to revive Japanese militarism is not realistic thinking for the future of Japan. This attitude is extremely detrimental to Japan. The sweet words sent from across the Pacific about Japan's "leading position" in Asia are actually sugar-coated poison. The purpose of this poison is to lead Japan onto the old road of 1937 and destroy Japan's future. Everyone who cherishes Japan's future and cares about Japan's destiny must be vigilant about this.

The restoration of normal Soviet-Japanese relations has self-evident benefits for Japan. All Japanese people with national self-esteem cannot help but ask: Why shouldn't the Soviet-Japanese negotiations be subordinate to Japan's national interests but should be subordinate to the consideration of relations with the United States? The Japanese people have already felt great dissatisfaction with the Japanese government's delay in the Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Any Japanese political figure who cares about his own political future must seriously consider this sentiment of the Japanese people. Now the Soviet-Japanese negotiations still have a chance of success. The conversations of Bulganin and Khrushchev with the visiting delegation of Japanese parliamentarians to the Soviet Union clearly expressed the Soviet Union's position, attitude, and sincerity in seeking an agreement. The current recess gives the Japanese government enough time to weigh the gains and losses and change its attitude towards the negotiations. People are now closely watching the future trend of the Japanese government on the issue of Soviet-Japanese negotiations, which will help determine whether the Japanese government will embark on the road of serving the American policy of aggression, or whether it intends to return to the big family of Asian peace-loving countries.

    评苏日谈判
    蒋元椿
    苏联政府和日本政府之间关于苏日关系正常化的谈判，从六月三日在伦敦开始举行以来，已经进行了四个多月。由于日本方面采取了明显的拖延的态度，谈判在经过这样长的时间以后仍然没有得到什么结果。九月二十一日，苏日谈判宣布短期中断。日本方面的谈判代表松本俊一已经返回日本，就谈判的前途和日本政府进行磋商。正如共同社驻伦敦的记者所指出的，苏日谈判“今后的成败只是要看日本政府作怎样的打算而定”。
    苏日关系的正常化，不仅是日本人民的迫切愿望，也是亚洲和世界各国爱好和平的人民密切关心的事情。
    第二次世界大战结束已经十年，由于日本在美国长期占领下所产生的政治情势，日本同它的两大邻邦中国和苏联之间的战争状态仍然没有结束。这种情况只是对于那些企图把日本变成敌对中国和苏联的军事基地的人才是有利的。对于日本人民来说，这种情况的继续存在意味着巨大的危险，并且阻碍了日本和这两大邻邦的经济上和文化上的传统联系的恢复，加深了日本人民的痛苦。
    因此，日本人民普遍要求恢复日本和中、苏两国的正常关系，这种要求随着苏联和中国在这个问题上所采取的主动而日益加强。早在一九五三年，苏联就明确表示愿意同日本恢复正常关系。中、苏两国在一九五四年十月十二日发表的关于对日本关系的联合宣言，在日本引起了巨大的反响，使日本人民争取恢复日中、日苏正常关系的运动有了进一步的发展。
    在这种情况下，继吉田政府上台的鸠山政府表示了愿意争取恢复日本和中、苏之间的正常关系，首先是和苏联的关系。鸠山政府的外务相重光葵在一九五四年十二月十一日具体表示日本愿意在彼此可以接受的条件下恢复和苏联、中国的关系。鸠山本人在今年年初日本大选的过程中也一再认为：“调整日苏邦交是全国人民的要求”；“使日本同中苏两国的邦交趋于正常化，也就是通往世界和平的道路”。
    为了苏联人民和日本人民的利益，苏联政府主动地建议和日本进行关于恢复正常关系的谈判。在苏联的努力之下，双方在解决了关于谈判地点的分歧以后，苏日谈判终于开始举行。苏日谈判的举行不仅符合日本人民的愿望，而且也符合于亚洲和平的利益，因此得到了各国人民的欢迎和重视。
    然而，还在苏日谈判没有开始之前，就已经可以看得很清楚，国际上以及日本国内的某些势力，对于苏日关系的正常化抱着敌视的态度。它们为了阻挠苏日谈判的成功，从各方面对日本政府施加了强大的压力。共同社在六月初的一篇评论中明确指出这些势力是谁。共同社指出，“单是日苏开始谈判的事实，就已使日本国民流露出好像已经稍稍远离了‘冷战’漩涡的那种明朗的表情……对美国的领导者来说，这些决不是值得高兴的。”作为美国这种情绪在日本国内的反映，日本的某些政党竭力企图阻挠苏日谈判的成功，主张必须首先解决日苏之间关于遣返日本战犯、渔业以及所谓领土等问题，“否则就不要恢复邦交”，因此不同意举行苏日谈判。
    很明显，如果鸠山政府尊重日本人民的愿望，实践自己在大选时的诺言，奉行独立的外交政策，抵抗这些漠视日本人民利益的势力的干涉，那末，苏日谈判就有一切条件迅速获得成就，为苏日正常关系的恢复造成良好的开端。
    苏联在谈判中采取了合情合理的、尊重谈判对方的态度。苏联认为，首先必须结束战争状态，对苏联和日本两国过去的战争和冲突不究既往。在苏日建立外交关系和交换使节之后，再通过正常的外交途径，在互惠的基础上就两国之间的各项问题进行谈判。日本首相鸠山在一月间驳斥反对苏日谈判的论调时曾经指出，在恢复邦交之后再解决日苏之间的各项问题，“这是外交方面的原则”。他认为反对日苏谈判的人的主张是“本末倒置”。这就充分证明了苏联态度的正确。在这种情况下，谈判的顺利进展应该是不成问题的事情。苏联同西德谈判的经验证明，只要双方对于建立正常关系表现同样的关心和愿望，那末问题在几天之内就能得到圆满的解决。
    但是，令人奇怪的是日本外交当局在具体谈判时，竟然放弃了鸠山首相所表明的立场，而采取了本末倒置的态度。日本坚持以解决遣返日本战犯以及所谓领土等问题作为恢复两国正常关系的先决条件，从而给人这样的印象：似乎日本方面实际上并不想结束日苏之间的战争状态，因而对苏日关系正常化不感兴趣，这才故意提出一些不可接受的先决条件来拖延谈判。日本外务相重光葵并在谈判刚开始不久就故意违反关于谈判应该秘密进行的协议，片面透露同事实不符的会谈内容，在国内制造敌视苏联的气氛，把谈判的障碍推在苏联身上。他还说这是为了“避免舆论迷失方向”，“不是外交方面的背信行为”。重光葵的这种态度明显地受到美国的教唆和鼓励。国际新闻社报道说，美国官员认为日本“做得很巧妙”。他们还说如果日本同意在各项问题解决之前就签订和约和使外交关系正常化，“就会失去唯一的力量”，换句话说，就是会失去阻挠苏日关系正常化的机会。
    尽管苏联在谈判中作了努力，日本却仍然抱着僵硬的态度，因而使得谈判长期拖延。用在伦敦的日本记者们的话来说，“在苏联方面，有证据说明他们将设法把日内瓦会议的精神灌输到伦敦谈判中”，而“在日方说来，对苏谈判完全是拖延时间的局面，每次会谈都围绕着同一个问题打转”。很明显，日本外交当局对于苏日谈判的拖延和没有进展应该担负完全的责任。
    日本共同社的记者早在七月下旬就在评论苏日谈判时指出，日本方面“最重要的是看清目前的国际局势”。这是完全正确的。美国“实力政策”失败，国际局势有了缓和，日本人民和日本爱国力量都表示欢迎。正确地看清这种局势，为日本的利益设想，日本政治家，只有使日本同一切国家，特别是同自己的近邻，苏联和中国建立和发展友好关系，才能提高日本的国际地位，保障日本的和平和安全。在今天还要想紧跟着美国，一切唯命是从，企图依靠美国来复活日本军国主义，就不是现实地为日本的前途作想。这种态度对日本是极其不利的。从太平洋彼岸送来的关于日本在亚洲的“领导者的地位”的甜言蜜语，实际上是包着糖衣的毒药。这味毒药的目的是要把日本引上一九三七年的老路，毁灭日本的前途。一切珍惜日本的前途，关心日本命运的人，对此都不能不有所警惕。
    日苏正常关系的恢复对于日本有着不言而喻的利益。日本一切有民族自尊心的人都不能不问：为什么苏日谈判不应该服从于日本的民族利益而应该服从于同美国的关系的考虑？日本人民对于日本政府拖延苏日谈判已经感到极大的不满。任何关心自己政治前途的日本政治人物都不能不认真考虑日本人民的这种情绪。现在苏日谈判仍然有着成功的机会。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫对日本国会议员访苏团的谈话明确地表示了苏联的立场、态度和谋求协议的诚意。目前的休会使日本政府有足够的时间来衡量得失和利害，改变它对谈判的态度。人们现在正在密切注视着日本政府今后在苏日谈判问题上的动向，这将有助于判明日本政府究竟将走上为美国侵略政策服务的道路，还是有意回到亚洲和平国家的大家庭里面来。
