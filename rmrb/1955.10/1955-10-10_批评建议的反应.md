Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    Letter from the Personnel Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee: The "Reader's Letters" section on August 3rd published the criticism from Comrades Qian Jinfu and Tian Kai regarding our bureau's disapproval of absorbing discharged soldiers into work. After investigation, we found that we did not have any erroneous ideas of discrimination or exclusion against discharged soldiers in our guiding ideology; however, due to focusing too much on the regulations and existing difficulties in cadre work, we lacked the necessary proactive attitude towards absorbing these discharged soldiers into work. We sincerely accept the criticism, and we will definitely do a responsible job in resettling discharged soldiers in the future.

    Letter from the Shulu County Health Center: The criticism in the "Reader's Letters" section on September 11th regarding our hospital's poor hygiene is consistent with the facts. Our hospital has already begun to improve the hygiene situation, stipulating that each department should carry out a cleanup before and after work every day, conduct a major cleaning once a week, and install fly and dust prevention equipment in toilets and kitchens.

    批评建议的反应
    浙江省人民委员会人事局来信：八月三日“读者来信专页”发表了钱金富、田凯两同志对我局不批准吸收复员军人参加工作的批评。经过检查，我们在指导思想上并没有任何歧视、排斥复员军人的错误想法；但是由于过多地看到了干部工作方面的制度及存在的困难，因而对吸收这批复员军人参加工作缺乏应有的积极态度。我们诚恳接受批评，今后一定要认真负责地做好安置复员军人的工作。
