    Heilongjiang Province has mobilized a group of surplus laborers from cities to engage in agricultural production in the countryside. As of mid-September, according to statistics from seven cities including Harbin, more than 62,300 people have been mobilized to go to the countryside and have been settled in rural areas to participate in production. Currently, 75% of these immigrants have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and the rest have joined relatively good mutual aid teams. Many immigrants have written to the people's governments in their original places of residence, expressing their determination to concentrate on production, grow more grain, and support national construction. After 60 immigrant households arrived in Sijiazi District, AiHui County, they immediately engaged in production such as wheat harvesting, wheat picking, and firewood gathering.

    In July of this year, Heilongjiang Province convened a wasteland reclamation and immigration conference. While deciding to reclaim 100,000 hectares of wasteland for immigrants, it also planned to mobilize 18,000 households of residents without occupations but with labor power from seven cities including Harbin in the province to go to the countryside for production. In this way, the province can expand the cultivated area by 32,000 hectares, increase grain production by 64 million catties next year, and also reduce the amount of grain supplied to cities. This measure not only finds a way out for some surplus labor in cities, but also solves the problem of insufficient labor in rural areas with a lot of wasteland. Therefore, it is widely welcomed by the masses, and many residents without occupations and with labor power have asked to go to the countryside for production. (Zhang Xin)

    黑龙江各城市动员剩余劳动力下乡生产
    黑龙江省从城市里动员了一批剩余劳动力下乡从事农业生产。截至九月中旬，据哈尔滨等七个城市统计，已动员下乡并已安置到农村参加生产者达六万二千三百多人。目前，这些移民已有百分之七十五参加了农业生产合作社，其余都参加了较好的互助组。许多移民写信给原住地人民政府，表示一定安心生产，多打粮食，支援国家建设。瑷珲县四嘉子区六十户移民到村后就投入麦收、拣小麦、打柴等生产。
    今年七月，黑龙江省召开了开荒移民会议，在决定为移民开荒十万垧的同时，还计划从省内哈尔滨等七个城市动员一万八千户没有职业而有劳动力的居民下乡生产，这样全省可扩大耕地面积三万二千垧，明年能增产六千四百万斤粮食，同时还减少了城市粮食的供应量。这一措施既为城市里部分剩余劳动力找到出路，又解决了农村荒地多劳动力不足的困难问题。因此，受到群众普遍欢迎，许多没有职业有劳动力的居民纷纷要求下乡生产。（张昕）
