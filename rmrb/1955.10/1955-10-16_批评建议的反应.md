Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the CPC wrote: The People's Daily exposed the crime of Liu Hanyi, Vice President of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Hospital, raping a woman on August 28th. After investigation, it was confirmed. Liu Hanyi has been expelled from the Party and was arrested by the Taiyuan Municipal Intermediate People's Court on September 3rd in accordance with the law. The Party Committee of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has reviewed its past shortcomings in handling this incident in a timely manner. As for the problems of other leaders of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Hospital mentioned in the reader's letter, they are also under investigation.

After the "Reader's Letters" page published the letter "Overcome Bureaucracy and Prevent Corruption Incidents" on September 3rd, the Jinan Railway Administration has written to accept criticism. They have issued a circular to the entire railway system and decided to improve the financial management system and strengthen the review and education of staff in the future.

The relevant personnel who were derelict in their duties in the Wang Zhengke embezzlement case have also been duly punished: The chief of the Xuecheng Engineering Section was demoted to deputy chief, and the chief accountant was dismissed, and they each compensated 35% of the unrecovered losses; the accountant Wei Fukui and the cashier Zhao Yuying each received a major demerit and each compensated 15% of the losses, and the chief of the Engineering Department, who directly led the business of the Engineering Section, was also given a demerit.

After this newspaper published a letter on August 21st criticizing Wang Jiemin, director of the Hubei Dawu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, for discriminating against demobilized soldiers, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Xiaogan Prefectural Committee of the CPC has dealt with the matter and decided to give Wang Jiemin a public warning within the Party, and suggested that an administrative demotion be given (demoted to first deputy director).

After this newspaper published a letter of criticism on September 18th, "Confidential Documents Are Not Allowed to Be Sent by Ordinary Mail," the Raw Materials Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Liaoning Provincial Company of China Minerals Company have written to review their actions and proposed improved methods for sending confidential letters.
