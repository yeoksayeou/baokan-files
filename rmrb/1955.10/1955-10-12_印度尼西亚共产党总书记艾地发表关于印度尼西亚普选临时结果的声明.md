Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, October 11th: The Indonesian "People's Daily" published on October 11th a statement by Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, analyzing the preliminary results of the Indonesian general election.

The statement said that the purpose of the Indonesian Communist Party in participating in the election was to strive for the victory of the Indonesian Communist Party and other democratic parties, and to fight against the anti-unity, anti-democratic, and anti-communist coalition of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party. In short, the Indonesian Communist Party's aim is to fight for the victory of the anti-colonial united front.

The statement pointed out that the Indonesian people have achieved their goals in the general election. Parties that pursue democratic policies and unity policies have defeated the coalition of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party.

The statement announced the Indonesian Communist Party's position after the general election and regarding the future cabinet, saying that the Indonesian Communist Party will not refuse to cooperate with any party and has never refused to cooperate with the Masyumi Party, because the Indonesian Communist Party believes that the main enemy of the Indonesian people at present is the remnants of Dutch colonialism in the economic, political, educational, and cultural fields, and national forces must be united to eliminate this force. Therefore, the Indonesian Communist Party believes that the best government after the election would be a national united government led by the Indonesian Nationalist Party and the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association, with the participation of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Masyumi Party, the Indonesian Islamic Union Party, the Indonesian Christian Party, etc., and implementing the anti-colonialist policies of the Ali-Arifin cabinet. If such a united government is formed, the government will have almost no opposition party, and can concentrate national forces to oppose foreign enemies and carry out domestic construction.

The statement analyzed the victory of the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association, saying that although the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association has always been called conservative, on political issues, especially in the campaign speeches made by its leaders, the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association has demonstrated tolerance and sincerity in implementing anti-colonialist, democratic, and national policies and in cooperating with other democratic parties, including the Indonesian Nationalist Party and the Indonesian Communist Party. Compared with the anti-unity, anti-democratic, and anti-national policies of the Masyumi Party, the policies of the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association are certainly more in line with the wishes of the Muslim masses. The large number of votes received by the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association proves that Muslims are inclined towards democracy.

The statement pointed out that as long as the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association can implement the anti-colonialist unity policy and the democratic and national policies as it demonstrated during the Ali-Arifin cabinet period and as its leaders put forward during the campaign, and can take a clear attitude towards terrorist gangs, then the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association will become the largest and most important Islamic political party in Indonesia.

The statement said that the victory of the Indonesian Nationalist Party is clear evidence of the strong anti-colonialist spirit of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian Nationalist Party is the oldest nationalist party, and opposition to colonialism is its tradition. The Indonesian Nationalist Party believes that in order to oppose colonialism, it must cooperate with all parties that are fighting for national independence—including the Indonesian Communist Party. During the Ali-Arifin cabinet, the Indonesian Nationalist Party showed that its policies were significantly different from those of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party. This is the most important factor that enabled the Indonesian Nationalist Party to win in the election. If it continues to be loyal to the democratic and anti-colonialist tradition, implements the foreign policy produced at the Asian-African Conference, and removes corrupt elements from its ranks, it will continue to be the most important nationalist party.

Aidit's statement said that the victory of the Indonesian Communist Party in becoming one of the major parties in the country is a victory for the policy of striving for national unity. It proves the close connection between the Indonesian Communist Party and the working people. The Indonesian Communist Party's anti-colonialist policy, peace policy, policy of defending and developing the democratic principles of the republic, and policy of striving for national unity have won millions of votes not only among workers and peasants, but also among people from other strata.

The statement concluded by saying that if the victorious democratic parties continue to be loyal to the speeches they made during the campaign, then the cabinet formed after the new parliament emerges will definitely be more progressive and firmer in action than the Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet. The statement said that this is possible and worth fighting for.

    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地发表关于印度尼西亚普选临时结果的声明
    新华社雅加达十一日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”十一日刊载了印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地的分析印度尼西亚普选的临时结果的声明。
    声明说，印度尼西亚共产党参加选举的目的是为争取印度尼西亚共产党和其他民主党派的胜利，为击败马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党的反团结、反民主和反共的联合而奋斗。简单地说，印度尼西亚共产党的目的是为反殖民主义统一战线的胜利而奋斗。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚人民在普选中已经达到了他们的目的。奉行民主的各民族的政策和团结政策的党派击败了马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党的联合。
    声明宣布印度尼西亚共产党在普选后和对将来的内阁的立场说，印度尼西亚共产党将不拒绝同任何党派合作而且从来没有拒绝同马斯友美党合作，因为印度尼西亚共产党认为，印度尼西亚人民目前主要的敌人是荷兰殖民主义在经济、政治、教育和文化方面的残余势力，必须团结全国力量来消灭这种势力。因此，印度尼西亚共产党认为，选举后的最好的政府将是由印度尼西亚国民党和印度尼西亚回教师联合会领导的，有印度尼西亚共产党、马斯友美党、印度尼西亚回教联盟党、印度尼西亚基督教党等参加的，实行阿里—阿里芬内阁的反殖民主义政策的民族联合政府。如果这种联合政府组成，政府就差不多完全没有反对党，而可以集中全国的力量来反对国外的敌人并且进行国内的建设。
    声明分析印度尼西亚回教师联合会的胜利说，虽然印度尼西亚回教师联合会一直被人们称为是保守的，但是在政治问题上，特别是在它的领袖们所发表的竞选演说中，印度尼西亚回教师联合会在执行反殖民主义的民主和民族政策方面和在同包括印度尼西亚国民党和印度尼西亚共产党在内的其他民主党派合作方面表现了容忍和真诚的精神。同马斯友美党的反团结、反民主和反民族的政策相比，印度尼西亚回教师联合会的政策肯定地是比较符合回教徒群众的愿望的。印度尼西亚回教师联合会所得到的大量选票证明，回教徒是倾向民主的。
    声明指出，只要印度尼西亚回教师联合会能够像在阿里—阿里芬内阁时期所表现的和它的领袖们在竞选活动中所提出的那样贯彻执行反殖民主义的团结的政策和民主的、民族的政策，并且能够对恐怖匪帮采取明确的态度，那末印度尼西亚回教师联合会将成为印度尼西亚最大的和最重要的回教政党。
    声明说，印度尼西亚国民党的胜利是印度尼西亚人民强烈的反殖民主义精神的明证。印度尼西亚国民党是最老的民族主义政党，反对殖民主义是它的传统。印度尼西亚国民党认为，为了反对殖民主义，它必须同一切为民族独立而斗争的政党——包括印度尼西亚共产党在内——合作。在阿里—阿里芬内阁期间，印度尼西亚国民党表明，它的政策同马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党的政策有重大的差别。这是使印度尼西亚国民党能够在选举中取得胜利的最重要的因素。如果它继续忠于民主和反殖民主义的传统，执行在亚非会议上产生的外交政策并从它的队伍中清除腐化分子的话，它将继续成为最重要的民族主义政党。
    艾地的声明说，印度尼西亚共产党成为国内大党之一这个胜利是争取全国团结的政策的胜利。它证明了印度尼西亚共产党和劳动人民之间的紧密联系。印度尼西亚共产党的反殖民主义政策、和平政策、保卫和发展共和国的民主原则的政策和争取全国团结的政策，不仅在工人和农民中间，而且也在其他阶层人民中间得到了成百万的选票。
    声明最后说，如果取得胜利的民主党派继续忠于它们在竞选时发表的演说，那末在新国会出现以后成立的内阁在行动方面一定会比阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁更加进步，更加坚定。声明说，这是可能的，也是值得为之奋斗的。
