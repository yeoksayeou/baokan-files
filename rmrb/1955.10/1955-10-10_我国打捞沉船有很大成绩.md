Since its establishment in 1951, the state-owned China People's Salvage Company has salvaged, according to preliminary statistics, more than 100 various types of vessels sunk underwater, totaling nearly 100,000 tons. The vast majority of these have been repaired. The "Jiangxin," a Yangtze River passenger and cargo ship, and the "Zhenghe," a coastal passenger and cargo ship, both sunk by American and Chiang Kai-shek planes in the early days of Liberation; the dredgers "Hankou" and "Changjiang," sunk before the Japanese surrender, have all been salvaged, repaired, and put back into production. The recently salvaged seagoing passenger and cargo ship "Jinan Maru," the Yangtze River passenger and cargo ship "Dehe," and the oil tanker "Tongdan" are also being repaired and will soon be able to participate in transportation. The salvage and repair of these ships have increased the country's transportation capacity and saved foreign exchange. The China People's Salvage Company has also done a great deal of work in clearing navigational obstacles along the coast and at the mouth of the Yangtze River, rescuing ships in distress, assisting certain factories and mines in underwater engineering construction, and supporting national defense construction.

Before Liberation, China's private salvage companies lacked sufficient capital and often lacked fixed workers and tools. The quality of salvage work was very low, and accidents such as damage to ship hulls often occurred. In the past, China had not carried out any large-scale salvage projects, and the technical level of the workers was also very low. In recent years, salvage workers have actively learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and have created many advanced working methods and some salvage tools. For example, the "underwater automatic mud attacker" created by salvage workers Yao Genfu, Jiang Dasheng, Wang Yutian, and others, and the "high-pressure water jet mud flushing method" created by Wang Baofa, overcame the difficulties of threading steel wire ropes under sunken ships and underwater mud flushing; the "double-line multi-cannon blasting method" created by Zhou Zhiming greatly improved the efficiency of underwater explosions and shortened construction time; the "voltage water measuring device" created by Mao Dasheng solved the problem of measuring the water depth of floating compartments of sunken ships. At present, China has the technical capability to salvage large ships of 5,000 tons.

### 我国打捞沉船有很大成绩

    我国打捞沉船有很大成绩
    国营中国人民打捞公司在一九五一年成立以来，据初步统计，已经打捞起各类沉在水底的船舶一百多艘，近十万吨。其中绝大部分已经修复。解放初期被美蒋飞机炸沉的长江客货轮“江新”和沿海客货轮“郑和”，在日寇投降前沉没的挖泥船
  “汉口号”和“昌江号”都已经在捞起后修复投入生产。最近捞起的海上客货轮“济南丸”、长江客货轮“德和”和油轮“桐丹”，也正在修理，不久即可参加运输。这些船舶的打捞修复，为国家增加了运输力量，节约了外汇。中国人民打捞公司在清除沿海和长江口的航道障碍，抢救遇险船舶，协助某些厂矿进行水下工程建筑和支援国防建设等方面也作了不少工作。
    解放以前，我国的一批私营打捞公司既没有足够的资本，又往往没有固定的工人和应用工具，打捞工作质量很低，常常发生破坏船体等事故。过去我国没有进行过比较大的打捞工程，工人技术水平也很低。最近几年来，打捞工人们积极学习了苏联的先进经验，并创造了许多先进的工作方法和一些打捞工具。如打捞工人姚根福、江达生、王玉田等创造的“水下自动攻泥器”，王宝发创造的“高压水苗冲泥法”，克服了在沉船底下穿钢丝绳和水下冲泥的困难；周志明创造的“双线多炮爆破法”，大大提高了水下爆炸的效率，缩短了施工时间；毛达生创造的“电压测水器”，解决了沉船起浮舱水深度的测量问题。目前，我国已经具备了打捞五千吨级大型船舶的技术能力。
