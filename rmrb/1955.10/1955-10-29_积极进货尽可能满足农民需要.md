    Actively Stock Goods to Satisfy Farmers' Needs as Much as Possible
    Mu Lan
    The rural market has now entered its peak season. After selling agricultural and sideline products, farmers urgently need to purchase a batch of daily-use industrial products, in addition to buying means of production. In principle, the staff of rural supply and marketing cooperatives should thoroughly understand the needs of farmers and actively organize the procurement of goods to meet their living needs after the autumn harvest and support the procurement of agricultural and sideline products.

    However, some staff members of supply and marketing cooperatives have a negative mindset of being afraid of stockpiles and unwilling to purchase goods. They believe that it is enough to just purchase a small amount of goods to cope with the situation, regardless of whether the variety of goods is complete or whether they are popular with the masses. They say, "Having some is better than having none," as long as there are some goods, that's enough. They have a theory: "Rather have customers waiting at the door than goods waiting for customers," meaning they would rather have customers waiting and unable to buy things than have goods sitting around waiting to be bought.

    Under the influence of this thinking, out-of-stock phenomena are very common in rural supply and marketing cooperatives, and farmers cannot buy things after the autumn harvest. For example, in De Ping County, Shandong Province, some district supply and marketing cooperatives do not even supply thermos bottles, good socks, towels, or small pieces of hard candy; in Xiajin County, a district supply and marketing cooperative only has about fifty undershirts left over from last year in stock and does not plan to purchase any more. In Qihe County, blue, white cloth, and large and small floral serge have been unavailable for about twenty days. White cloth and large floral serge are generally out of stock in many areas. Some supply and marketing cooperatives adopt the method of selling a little, purchasing a little, and purchasing goods from state-owned companies several times a day. Once state-owned companies are off work, the cooperatives are out of stock. This seriously affects the improvement of farmers' lives after a bumper harvest.

    Obviously, this kind of thinking and practice of not actively supplying the needs of the peak season market is completely wrong. The root cause of this thinking is that some comrades lack analysis and research on this year's peak season market. They blindly believe that they purchased too many goods last year, and the sales situation in the first half of this year was not good. They have already suffered losses from stockpiled funds, and if they purchase more goods, there will be even more stockpiles. Therefore, they feel that purchasing goods later is better than purchasing them earlier, and having fewer goods is better than having more. They even put forward irresponsible statements such as "Having some is better than having none" regarding the supply of the rural market.

    It should be recognized that the first half of this year was the off-season, and some commodities were blindly allocated to rural areas that farmers did not need, resulting in stockpiles of some commodities. Now is the autumn harvest peak season, and this year most areas across the country, except for a very few, have had bumper harvests. This year, the social purchasing power of rural areas in the fourth quarter will increase significantly compared to previous years, and the autumn peak season market will be even more prosperous than in previous years. Especially in technical crop areas, due to the early harvest season this year, the market supply of agricultural products is large and concentrated, the state's purchase funds are invested more, and farmers' purchasing power has increased even more. Therefore, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must expand the supply of industrial products and must not use old perspectives to look at new problems simply because they did not complete the sales plan in the first half of this year. It should be understood that state-owned commercial departments have sufficient commodities this year. As long as supply and marketing cooperatives can actively purchase goods and provide a full supply, they will not only be able to complete the sales plan and improve farmers' lives but also support the needs of peak season purchase funds. This is because more than 80% of the funds needed to purchase agricultural products rely on the money recouped from selling industrial products to farmers.

    The staff of supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must quickly correct the conservative thinking of underestimating the purchasing power of farmers in the peak season and being unwilling to actively purchase goods. They must actively and proactively purchase goods from state-owned commercial departments to meet the needs of rural areas.

    积极进货尽可能满足农民需要
    牟澜
    目前农村市场已进入旺季，农民在出卖了农产品和副产品以后，除了购买生产资料外，还迫切需要购进一批日用工业品。按理讲，农村供销合作社的工作人员，应该深入了解农民的需要，积极组织进货，以满足农民秋收后的生活需要，并支持农产品和副产品的收购工作。
    可是，在部分供销社的工作人员中，有怕积压而不愿进货的消极思想。他们认为只要少进点货应付一下就可以，至于商品的花色品种是否齐全，是否为群众所喜爱，那就可以不管。他们说：“‘有毛不算秃’，只要有一些商品就可以了。”他们有一种论调：“宁叫客拥门，勿叫货等客”，就是宁让顾客等着买不到东西，不能让货物放着等人来买。
    在这种思想的支配下，农村供销合作社的脱销现象很普遍，农民在秋收后买不到东西。如山东省德平县有的区供销合作社连暖水瓶、好袜子、毛巾、小块花糖都没有供应；夏津县有一个区供销合作社库存的卫生衣只有去年剩下来的五十来件，也不打算进货。齐河县有二十来天买不到青、蓝、白布和大小花哔叽。许多地区白布、大花哔叽普遍脱销。有的供销社采取销一点、进一点、每日向国营公司进货数次的办法，国营公司一下班，合作社就脱销。这就严重地影响了农民丰收后对生活的改善。
    很显然，这种不积极供应旺季市场需要的思想和做法，是十分错误的。而产生这种思想的根源是由于某些同志对今年旺季市场缺乏分析研究，他们盲目地认为去年进货多了，今年上半年销售情况不好，已经吃了积压资金的亏，要是再多进货，积压就更多。因此就觉得早进货不如晚进货，货多不如货少，甚至提出“有毛不算秃”等对农村市场供应不负责任的说法。
    应该认识到：今年上半年正值淡季，再加上有些商品是盲目调拨给农村，农民又不需要，因而造成部分商品的积压。而现在正值秋收旺季，今年全国除极少数地区外，大部分地区是丰收。今年第四季度农村的社会购买力比往年有很大的增长，秋后旺季市场将会出现比往年更旺的局面。特别是在技术作物区，由于今年收获季节早，农产品的上市量大又集中，国家收购的资金投放得多，农民购买力有了更大的增长。因此，各地供销合作社必须扩大工业品的供应，决不能因为今年上半年没有完成销售计划而用老眼光来看新问题。要知道，今年国营商业部门的商品是充裕的，供销合作社只要能积极进货，充分供应，不但能完成销售计划，改善农民生活，同时又能支持旺季收购资金的需要。因为收购农产品所需要的资金，有百分之八十以上是依靠向农民销售工业品回笼的货币。
    各地供销社的工作人员，必须迅速纠正对旺季农民购买力估计不足、不愿积极进货的保守思想，积极主动地向国营商业部门进货，以满足农村需要。
