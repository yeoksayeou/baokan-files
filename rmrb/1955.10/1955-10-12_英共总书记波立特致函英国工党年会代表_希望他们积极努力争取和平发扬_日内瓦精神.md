Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th (TASS dispatch) - The British Communist Party press office announced that the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Pollitt, wrote a letter to the representatives attending the British Labour Party annual meeting in Margate, asking them to actively work to consolidate world peace. Pollitt said that the Labour Party has the possibility to launch a broad movement to promote the "Geneva Spirit" and ensure the success of the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The letter pointed out that some influential forces in Britain and the United States are trying their best to nullify the results of the Geneva Four Heads of Government Conference. The letter expressed concern that the Labour Party leadership is not prepared to launch a broad mass movement to ensure the success of the Foreign Ministers Conference. The letter said: "Such a movement will be supported by the united forces of the entire labor movement." The purpose of this movement should be to strive for "a constructive foreign policy and further measures to consolidate world peace" in Geneva. These measures include the establishment of a European collective security system, reaching an agreement on the reduction of armaments, the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs, guaranteeing the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and eliminating obstacles to trade between East and West.

    英共总书记波立特致函英国工党年会代表
    希望他们积极努力争取和平发扬“日内瓦精神”
    新华社十一日讯　据塔斯社伦敦十日讯：英国共产党新闻处宣布，共产党总书记波立特写给出席在马尔加特举行的英国工党年会的代表们一封信，要求他们积极为巩固世界和平而努力。波立特说，工党有可能展开广泛的运动来发扬“日内瓦精神”，并且保证日内瓦四国外长会议获得成功。信中指出，英国和美国的一些有影响的势力正在竭力企图使四国政府首脑日内瓦会议的成果化为乌有。信中对工党领导不准备展开广泛的群众运动来保证外长会议获得成功表示不安。信里说：“这样的运动将会受到整个工人运动的联合力量的支持。”这一运动的目的应该是争取在日内瓦实行“建设性的外交政策和采取巩固世界和平的进一步措施”，这些措施包括建立欧洲集体安全体系，就裁减军备、停止试验核子武器和禁止原子弹和氢弹达成协议，保障人民中国在联合国的权利，消除东西方贸易的障碍等。
