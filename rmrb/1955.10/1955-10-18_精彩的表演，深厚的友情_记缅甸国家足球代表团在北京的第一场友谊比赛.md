    Wonderful Performance, Deep Friendship
    ——A Record of the Myanmar National Football Team's First Friendly Match in Beijing
    Pan Fu
    The first friendly match of the Myanmar National Football Team's visit to China was held on the afternoon of October 16th at the Xianongtan People's Stadium in Beijing. This match attracted more than 20,000 spectators. The game was consistently heated and intense, and the sincere friendship that permeated both inside and outside the stadium left a deep impression on people's hearts. Facing the guest team was the Beijing United Team, and the final score of the match was 5-3, with the Beijing United Team winning.
    The friendly match began amidst the thunderous applause of over 20,000 spectators. After a brief scramble near the midfield, the Beijing United Team launched an organized attack. Attempts by center forward Xing Guifu, left inside forward Quan Zhongshan, and right inside forward Chen Keliang to shoot were all unsuccessful. Next, the Myanmar National Football Team launched an offensive. The Myanmar team's left winger Sheng Pei advanced with the ball extremely quickly. Beijing United Team defender Gao Junshi bravely intercepted, Sheng Pei lofted a cross, passing to center forward Jue Zan to attack the goal, but the ball was caught by goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen. In the back-and-forth battle with no clear offensive, the two sides' offensive tactics gradually became distinct: the Myanmar team adopted the W-formation offensive method, with the forward line cuts having considerable speed. The Beijing United Team played a four-forward system, and their crossover switching was also relatively skilled. As the formation opened up, the offensive and defensive situation and the fierce competition became increasingly clear and intense. Twelve minutes after the start of the match, Beijing United Team's right winger Ha Zengguang received a pass from defender Ren Bin and powerfully shot from outside the Myanmar team's penalty area. The Myanmar team's goalkeeper La Mao punched the ball out, but it happened to land at the feet of Beijing United Team's left winger Cui Hengxie, who was cutting in. Cui unhesitatingly kicked it in. The Myanmar team conceded the first point.
    After conceding a goal, the Myanmar team's defense became even tighter, but it could not stop the Beijing United Team's crossover switching offense. In the nineteenth minute, Ha Zengguang sent another good ball to Cui Hengxie. The Myanmar team's goalkeeper La Mao bravely rushed out to save but made a mistake, Cui volleyed the ball into the net, making the score 2-0. The Beijing United Team became increasingly fierce. In the two sides' efforts to attack and defend, the athletes maintained excellent moral conduct. The Beijing United Team never made physical contact in any situation that could potentially harm the Myanmar team's players, and the Myanmar team also tried to avoid using dangerous moves to harm the opposing players. This high degree of friendly spirit was repeatedly encouraged and praised by the audience with warm applause.
    Thirty-three minutes into the first half, a Myanmar team defender inadvertently fouled in the penalty area, and Beijing United Team's midfielder Wang Xiwu took the penalty kick. The spectators in the stands were worried for the Myanmar team. Wang Xiwu's kick went wide, and this seemingly certain goal failed to break the net, causing great regret for more than 20,000 spectators. But the Myanmar team suddenly increased their spirit of offensive prowess, and they often nimbly sprinted with the ball into the Beijing United Team's defensive zone. Center forward Jue Zan and right inside forward Tu Hua's skilled ball-handling techniques posed a great threat to the Beijing United Team. Their two shots were both caught by goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen. The Beijing United Team then reorganized their attack. At this time, the Beijing United Team's accurate triangle short passing was performed very well. Center forward Xing Guifu received the ball and passed it to the left, and quickly crossed over with right inside forward Chen Keliang. Before the Myanmar team's defenders could closely mark them, Xing Guifu had already passed the ball from the right side in front of Chen Keliang, who was about to rush in from the left corner. Chen Keliang took advantage of the situation and kicked it hard, and the ball broke the net for the third time. This record was maintained until the end of the first half.
    Less than a minute into the second half, the Beijing United Team used a lightning-fast central breakthrough tactic and Xing Guifu kicked in a goal. After conceding four points in a row, the Myanmar team still did not panic. Especially the goalkeeper's calmness and clear judgment of position enabled many of the Beijing United Team's powerful shots to be ineffective. Frequent attacks and clever catches of dangerous balls led the game to a climax. After Beijing team's long offensive failed to succeed, the Myanmar team immediately launched an attack. Pei Qing showed his fast ball-handling skills, dodging the Beijing United Team's center back Wang Xinsheng, who was closely marking him, and quickly approached the Beijing United Team's defensive zone. But when he raised his foot to shoot, the ball went slightly high and grazed the goalpost out of bounds. Soon after, the Myanmar team's forwards once again pressed against the Beijing United Team's defense. Right forward Ba Hadoor's ball was kicked out of the baseline by Wang Xinsheng, resulting in a corner kick for the Myanmar team. Ba Hadoor kicked the ball out, directly falling in front of the Beijing United Team's goal. Huang Zhaowen jumped up to catch the ball, but lost his grip and it fell to the ground. The Myanmar team's right inside forward Tu Hua happened to arrive, and kicked the ball into the net. The entire audience responded to the Myanmar team's first goal and Tu Hua's agile performance with sustained applause. After scoring this goal, the Myanmar team's offensive spirit greatly increased. In less than two minutes, Pei Qing, who had switched to center forward in the second half, evaded the Beijing United Team's defender Ren Bin again and kicked a ball hard into the net near the goal. The score was 4-2, and the audience once again gave enthusiastic applause for the Myanmar team's wonderful performance. The Beijing United Team's counterattack strength was still strong, and conceding two goals instead made them even more determined. Center forward Xing Guifu received the ball near the midline, successively dodged the interceptions of three Myanmar team forwards and defenders, and passed the ball to Quan Zhongshan. Because the defensive line was forcing out to closely press other Beijing United Team forwards, Quan Zhongshan dribbled slightly for two steps, and then calmly kicked the ball into the goal. In order to strive for victory, the athletes on both sides competed even more fiercely. Ten minutes before the end of the match, Myanmar team's Ba Hadoor kicked in the third goal. The Beijing United Team repeatedly pounced and shot, but either went slightly high, slightly wide and out of bounds, or was bravely saved by La Mao. The score of 5-3 was maintained until the end of the match.
    This friendly match fully demonstrated the Myanmar National Football Team's excellent skills. Their forward line's speed and the sophistication of their ball-handling techniques are worthy of praise; and the accuracy of their shots on goal is also relatively high. They scored three goals in less than ten shooting opportunities, which proves that they have a certain degree of accomplishment in shooting techniques. Especially noteworthy is the goalkeeper La Mao's composure and ingenuity. Many of the Beijing United Team's powerful shots failed to break the net, which was due to La Mao's defense. La Mao has a strong ability to judge, can timely close the opponent's shooting angle, and often makes the Beijing United Team forwards unable to succeed despite their powerful shots. The Beijing United Team also played very well in this match. The cooperative collaboration between the forwards and defenders was relatively close. During the ninety-minute match, the Beijing United Team was able to press into the opponent's territory for a relatively long period of time. In addition to the athletes' relatively skilled ball skills, the appropriate use of the four-forward system with the defensive line assisting in the attack was the main reason for winning the victory. The fighting will and new sportsmanship of the athletes of both sides should also be praised, and the more than 20,000 spectators did give appropriate evaluations. The continuous applause rising from the stands not only gave great encouragement to the Beijing United Team's excellent performance, but also celebrated the guests' outstanding skills. Professor Guo Ge Li, the leader of the Myanmar National Football Team, said: We have played matches with many countries in Asia, and have never encountered such a good team as the Beijing United Team. What deeply touches us is the friendship of the Chinese people. We received a warm welcome in the stadium, and we received the same welcome on the way back after the match. This close friendship is the most unforgettable thing in our lives.
    Yes, this friendly match will greatly enhance the friendship between the people of China and Myanmar, and will also enhance our mutual understanding in sports.

    精彩的表演，深厚的友情
    ——记缅甸国家足球代表团在北京的第一场友谊比赛
    潘福
    缅甸国家足球代表团来华访问的第一场友谊比赛，十月十六日下午在北京先农坛人民体育场举行。这场比赛吸引了两万多观众。球赛始终热烈、紧张，洋溢在运动场内外的真挚的友谊，在人们心中留下了深深的印象。迎战客队的是北京联队，全场比赛结果五比三，北京联队获胜。
    友谊比赛在两万多观众轰然的掌声中开始。在中场附近展开为时不久的争夺后，北京联队开始了有组织的进攻。中锋邢桂福、左内锋权重善和右内锋陈克亮先后试射都未中的。接着，缅甸国家足球代表队发动攻势。缅甸队左翼盛佩带球推进极为迅速，北京联队后卫高筠时奋勇拦截，盛佩高球传中，给中锋觉赞冲门，但球已被守门员黄肇文接住。在没有攻势的拉锯战中，两方进攻战术也逐渐鲜明地显现出来：缅甸队采W式进攻方法，锋线切进具有相当高的速度。北京联队打的是四前锋制战术，交叉换位也较熟练。阵势拉开，攻守情况和激烈的争夺就越来越清晰和紧张。开赛后第十二分钟，北京联队右翼哈增光接后卫任彬来球，在缅甸队禁区外猛力射门。缅甸队守门员拉貌将球击出，却恰好落在乘势切入的北京联队左翼崔亨燮脚下。崔毫不犹豫地硬脚踢入。缅甸队先失一分。
    在失掉一个球以后，缅甸队的防守更加严密，但却阻拦不住北京联队的交叉换位进攻。第十九分钟，哈增光又给崔亨燮送来一只好球。缅甸队守门员拉貌奋勇冲出扑救失误，崔凌空踢球进网，场上纪录二比零。北京联队愈战愈猛。在双方的竭力攻守中，运动员们保持了优良的道德作风。北京联队在任何可能伤害缅甸队队员的情况下，从不发生身体接触，缅甸队也尽力避免用危险动作伤害对方球员。这种高度的友好精神，一再受到观众热烈掌声的鼓励和表扬。
    前半场开赛后三十三分钟，缅甸队后卫在禁区不慎犯规，北京联队前卫王锡文主踢十一公尺球。看台观众都为缅甸队担心。王锡文踢球偏出，这个势在必中的球未能破网，使两万多观众都大为惋惜。而缅甸队却陡然增长了攻坚锐气，他们常常敏捷地冲刺带球进入北京联队防区。中锋觉赞和右内锋图华的熟练带球技术曾给北京联队以很大威胁。他们两次攻门都被守门员黄肇文接住。北京联队随即再度组织进攻。这时候北京联队准确的三角短传表演得十分出色。中锋邢桂福得球左递，并迅速同右内锋陈克亮交叉换位。缅甸队后卫还来不及紧盯，邢桂福已从右边把球传在即将从左角冲入的陈克亮面前，陈克亮趁势猛踢一脚，球第三次破网。这个纪录保持到上半场终了。
    下半场开赛不到一分钟，北京联队即以闪电般的中央突破战术由邢桂福踢入一球。缅甸队连失四分后仍然不显慌乱，特别是守门员的镇静和清楚的判定方位的能力，使北京联队的许多次劲射都无法奏效。频繁的攻击和机智地接住险球，把这场比赛引向高潮。北京队久攻不克，缅甸队马上发动进攻。佩庆发挥了他的快速带球技术，闪开了紧迫他的北京联队中卫王新生，迅猛地迫近北京联队防区。但当他举脚射门时，球却稍高擦门柱飞出界外。不久，缅甸队前锋再次紧逼北京联队防线，右锋巴哈杜尔带球被王新生踢出底线，由缅甸队开角球。巴哈杜尔一脚踢出，直落北京联队门前，黄肇文跳起接球，失手落地。缅甸队右内锋图华恰好赶到，一脚踢进网内。全场观众对缅甸队的首次攻入和图华的敏捷表演报以长久不息的掌声。缅甸队在获得这一球后，进攻精神大大高涨。不到两分钟，下半场改踢中锋的佩庆又避开北京联队的后卫任彬，在近门处硬踢一球进网。场上纪录四比二，观众再为缅甸队的精彩表演发出热烈的掌声。北京联队反击力量仍然强大，连失两球反而使他们斗志更旺。中锋邢桂福在中线附近得球，接连避开了三个缅甸队锋卫的拦截，把球传给权重善。由于卫线迫出紧逼住其它北京联队前锋，权重善略带两步，即从容把球踢进大门。为了争取胜利，两方运动员竞争得更加激烈。终场前十分钟，缅甸队巴哈杜尔踢进了第三个球。北京联队一再猛扑、攻门，不是稍高、稍偏越出界外，就是被拉貌奋力救出。五比三的纪录一直保持到终场。
    这场友谊的比赛，充分显示了缅甸国家足球队的优良技术。他们锋线的速度和带球技术的纯熟都是值得赞扬的；而临门一脚的准确性也比较高，在不到十次的射门机会中即攻入三球，正表明他们在射门技术上有一定的素养。尤其值得称道的是守门员拉貌的沉着和机智。北京联队许多次强劲的射门都未能破网，是拉貌防守的功劳。拉貌判断能力较强，能及时关住对方射门角度，常使北京联队前锋虽有劲射，也不能成功。而北京联队在这场比赛中打得也很出色。锋卫之间的协同合作是比较紧密的，九十分钟的比赛，北京联队能较长时期地压进对方腹地，除运动员的比较熟练的球技外，卫线助攻的四前锋制战术运用得比较恰当，是赢得胜利的主要原因。双方运动员的战斗意志和新的体育道德作风，也同样应该受到赞扬，两万多观众也确实给了适当的评价。看台上不断腾起的掌声，不但给北京联队的出色表演以极大的鼓励，同时也是对客人的卓越技术的庆贺。缅甸国家足球代表团领队郭哥礼教授说：我们同亚洲许多国家作过比赛，还没有遭遇过像北京联队这样好的队。而深深地使我们感动的，是中国人民的友谊。我们在运动场上受到热烈的欢迎，在比赛后回来的路上也受到同样的欢迎。这种亲密的友谊，是我们一生中最难忘的。
    是的，这场友谊比赛，将会大大地增进中缅两国人民的友谊，在体育方面也将会增进我们相互之间的了解。
