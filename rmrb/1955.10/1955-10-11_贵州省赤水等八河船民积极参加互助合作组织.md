    Boatmen on Eight Rivers, Including Chishui in Guizhou Province, Actively Participate in Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations
    Under the leadership and assistance of the Party and the People's Government, private wooden boats at stations along eight rivers in Guizhou Province where navigation management stations have been established, including the Chishui River, Qingshui River, Dujiang River, and Liujiang River, are actively participating in cooperatives or mutual aid groups. From June to the end of August this year, according to statistics from navigation management stations in various regions, those who have already joined cooperatives or mutual aid groups account for 25.96% of the existing 2,531 boats.
    Currently, each cooperative or group has formulated autumn transportation plans to increase turnover, shorten travel time, ensure navigation safety, and better serve the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In order to improve transportation efficiency, the members have formed teams with boats of the same tonnage, with strong and weak laborers cooperating with each other, and selecting those with good skills to take charge of command work. To speed up sailing, each team has also established a sand-clearing team. Since the establishment of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the sailing speed has increased by two-fifths of the time; boats that originally carried five tons can now carry more than six tons.
    The 10,882 boatmen and boat people are mostly from ethnic minorities. On the Qing River alone, the Miao and Dong ethnic groups account for more than 80% of the total number of boat people. Before liberation, ethnic minority boatmen suffered extremely painful lives due to the plunder and extortion by feudal gang bosses and Kuomintang secret agents. They were not only unable to support their families, but also had no money to repair their boats. After liberation, with the help of loans from the People's Government, production was restored. Especially in 1953, during the democratic reform of private boats, the waterborne counter-revolutionary elements were severely struck, and the feudal gang boss system was abolished, which raised the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of boatmen.
    In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the wooden boat transportation industry has achieved great development, playing an active role in the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in Guizhou Province, especially in the task of transferring grain out of the province. From January to August 1955, compared with the same period in 1954, the transportation volume has increased significantly: grain increased by 159.63%; edible salt increased by 145.53%; tung oil increased by 164.96%; local specialties and department stores increased by 170.67%; passenger transport increased by 107.71%.

    贵州省赤水等八河船民积极参加互助合作组织
    贵州省已经设立航管站的赤水河、清水河、都江、柳江等八条河流上的各站民营木船，在党和人民政府的领导、帮助下，积极地参加合作社或互助组。从今年六月到八月底，据各地航管站的统计，已经参加合作社或互助组的，占现有二千五百三十一只船数的百分之二十五点九六。
    目前各社或组都订立了秋季运输计划，以提高周转量，缩短航行时间，保证航行安全，更好地为城乡物资交流服务。社员们为提高运输效率，用吨位相同的船只编成组队，队内劳力强弱的互相配合，并选拔技术好的担任指挥工作。为加快航行速度，各队还成立了突沙队。从建立互助合作的组织以来，航行速度加快了五分之二的时间；原来装五吨的船，现在可以装六吨以上。
    船工船民一万零八百八十二人，多数是兄弟民族。光清河，苗族和侗族就占船民总数的百分之八十以上。各民族船民，在解放以前由于受着封建把头和国民党特务分子的掠夺敲榨，生活极为痛苦，他们不但不能养家糊口，更没钱修补船只。解放以后，经过人民政府的贷款帮助，恢复了生产。特别在一九五三年，民船民主改革时，严重地打击了水上反革命分子，并废除了封建把头制度，提高了船工船民的政治觉悟和生产的积极性。
    几年以来，在党和人民政府的领导下，木船运输业获得了巨大的发展，对贵州省城乡物资交流，尤其是粮食外调任务起了积极的作用。一九五五年一月到八月同一九五四年同时期比较，运输量有显著增加：粮食增加百分之一百五十九点六三；食盐增加百分之一百四十五点五三；桐油增加百分之一百六十四点九六；土特产百货增加百分之一百七十点六七；客运增加百分之一百零七点七一。
