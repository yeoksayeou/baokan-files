Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. Young League members and active young people in rural areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shanxi, Hunan and other places are taking the lead in participating in agricultural production cooperatives.

In Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, 228 Young League members in the four townships of Gonghe, Qinhuai, Banchao, and Shuangzha have recently joined local agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for 94.6 percent of the total number of League members. After studying Chairman Mao's report on the issue of agricultural cooperation, young activists in Hongxi Township, Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, actively mobilized poor and lower-middle peasants to establish a new cooperative of 16 households. The number of young people who have recently joined agricultural production cooperatives in Guizhou Province has doubled compared to the past. Up to now, 590,000 rural youths in Yunnan Province have participated in agricultural production cooperatives, of which about 50,000 Young League members have assumed leadership positions such as cooperative directors and committee members. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League will organize and select 4,200 junior and senior primary school graduates to participate in the accounting work of agricultural production cooperatives in mountainous areas. Many junior and senior primary school graduates have recently signed up in response. Some rural youths in some areas are also actively participating in agricultural production cooperative cadre training courses held by the local Party committees.

Many rural youths use various forms to publicize the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives to the local masses. In Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province, 728 Young League members organized 80 cultural and recreational propaganda teams, who widely publicized to the masses through blackboards, storytelling, singing, and other forms. In more than ten counties in Hunan Province, such as Shaodong, Nanxian, and Anhua, over 10,000 Young League members and senior primary school graduates formed youth propaganda teams. In Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, youths in 43 townships formed propaganda groups for the cooperative building movement.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Rural youths in Guangdong, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui and other places are actively carrying out propaganda activities to welcome a new upsurge in the agricultural cooperation movement.

Many young people in various places have organized and established propaganda teams and propaganda stations to publicize the benefits of agricultural production cooperatives to local farmers. The youths in the fourth district of Lechang County, Guangdong Province, organized 26 propaganda teams. Meilian Township in Jieyang County also set up twelve fixed propaganda stations. In Niucun Township, Ding County, Hebei Province, more than 370 Young League members and youths organized a propaganda team. More than 100 young people in Shagou Township, Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, also participated in propaganda activities. These propaganda teams and propaganda stations use broadcasting, blackboards, clapper talk, ballads, slides, and mutual aid cooperation answers to conduct propaganda. The young propagandists in Xiaoli Township, Leling County, Shandong Province, also rehearsed dramas such as "Taking the Bright Road" and "Selling Surplus Grain to the State." Many young people in Hebei Province cited local specific examples to illustrate the benefits of agricultural cooperation in their propaganda.

Through these propaganda activities, the enthusiasm of many farmers in various places to take the road of cooperation has greatly increased. After the youth's propaganda in Jiudian Township, Feixiang County, Hebei Province, 72 farmers applied to join the cooperative.

This newspaper reports that in order to welcome the new upsurge of the socialist mass movement, Shaanxi, Anhui, Inner Mongolia and other places have transferred a large number of cadres from the provincial, special zone, county, and district levels to participate in the work of establishing agricultural production cooperatives. The first batch of more than 1,700 cadres transferred from the provincial level in Shaanxi Province have been organized into work teams according to eight special zones and four directly subordinate counties. After the end of the study, they will go to various places. The work team from provincial-level units to go to the countryside to participate in cooperative building is composed of staff from Party and government departments and students from provincial Party schools, cadre schools, and forestry training classes. Among them, Party and League members account for more than 60%. Most of these staff members, especially students from Party schools and cadre schools, have been tempered by various rural movements, and many have also participated in cooperative building work. Before their departure, they studied the Party Central Committee's instructions and other documents on the issue of agricultural cooperation. Realizing that the upsurge of the rural socialist mass movement is about to arrive, they strengthened their work confidence. Cadres at all levels throughout the province who are transferred to participate in cooperative building will arrive in rural areas before the end of October.

The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is transferring more than 13,000 full-time cooperative office cadres to enrich the leadership of the agricultural cooperation movement. After this group of full-time cooperative office cadres is equipped, in the cooperation movement in Anhui Province, not only the local Party committees and county committees of the Communist Party of China can organize cooperative office work teams, but also each township can set up a cooperative office instructor, and each district can set up a cooperative office work group. At present, the Suzhou Prefecture has equipped more than 1,100 townships with cooperative office instructors, and each district has also equipped more than 170 full-time cooperative office cadres. The first batch of more than 480 townships in Anqing Prefecture has established cooperative office instructors. It is expected that all full-time cooperative office cadres will be equipped by the end of October.

From September to early October, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has newly built more than 900 agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 23,300 households joining the cooperatives. Together with the original old cooperatives, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the region has developed to nearly 8,000. Since the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a mutual aid and cooperation meeting in early August, the League and administrative regions successively convened enlarged meetings of the Party committees, meetings of district committee secretaries, and meetings of township Party branches in late August. The meetings in various places conscientiously conveyed and studied Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperation and the spirit of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China's mutual aid and cooperation meeting, and formulated plans for the development and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives. Various places also trained more than 5,000 cooperative building cadres, mainly composed of Party branch secretaries, cooperative directors, and core members of newly built cooperatives. At present, there are more than 7,000 mutual aid groups in the region applying to transfer to cooperatives, and many farmers are also requesting to join the cooperatives. Party and government organs at all levels are examining the conditions for these mutual aid groups to transfer to cooperatives, and plan to transfer more than 1,000 cadres from directly subordinate organs to go deep into rural areas to help farmers build cooperatives. It is estimated that the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will develop to about 11,000 next year, with about 30% of the farmers joining the cooperatives.

    经过这些宣传活动，各地许多农民走合作化道路的热情大大提高。河北省肥乡县旧店乡经过青年们的宣传后，就有七十二户农民申请入社。
    本报讯　陕西、安徽、内蒙古等地为了迎接新的社会主义群众运动的高潮，从省、专区、县、区级抽调大批干部，参加建立农业生产合作社的工作。陕西省从省级抽调的第一批一千七百多名干部，已按八个专区、四个直属县组织了工作队。等学习结束，他们即将前往各地。省级单位下乡参加建社的工作队，是由党、政部门的工作人员和省党校、干校、林业训练班的学员组成。其中党、团员占百分之六十以上。这些工作人员中的大部分、尤其是党校、干校的学员，都经过农村各项运动的锻炼，不少人还参加过建社的工作。他们在出发前，学习了党中央关于农业合作化问题的指示等文件。认识到农村社会主义群众运动的高潮即将到来，加强了工作信心。全省各级抽调参加建社的干部，都将在十月底前到达农村。
    中共安徽省委员会正抽调一万三千多个专职办社干部，来充实农业合作化运动的领导力量。这批办社专职干部配齐之后，安徽省在合作化运动中，不仅中共各地委、县委都可组织办社工作队，而且每个乡都可设一个办社指导员，每个区都可设一个办社工作组。现在，宿县专区已在一千一百多个乡配备了办社指导员，各区也配备了一百七十多个专职办社干部。安庆专区第一批已有四百八十多个乡设立了办社指导员。全部办社专职干部预计十月底可以配齐。
