To the Editor:

This June, the Geological Department, without approval from the relevant competent authorities, built 36 dormitory rooms and 12 carports in the Sanlihe area outside Fuxingmen, with a total construction area of approximately 800 square meters. Although the Geological Department used some of its own materials for the construction, it still spent more than 17,000 yuan on labor and materials. However, this area has already been subject to an overall plan by the Beijing Municipal Planning Bureau, and the construction land has been uniformly requisitioned by the former Government Administration Council Housing Management Committee (now the Real Estate Department of the State Council机关事务管理局), preparing to build office buildings and dormitories for central-level organizations. The Geological Department's batch of houses happened to be built on the site of two office buildings and one dormitory building. At present, the construction preparation work for building office buildings in this area is all ready, and the original plan was to start construction on September 27th. Because the Geological Department refused to demolish this batch of privately built houses that disrupted the overall plan, construction has not been able to start to this day. The wages lost by the construction unit due to idling every day amount to 360 yuan.

In addition, in this area, the Second Ministry of Machine Building and the State Construction Commission also built many houses without the consent of the relevant competent authorities. These houses were built very haphazardly, which not only damaged the overall plan and the beauty of the entire building complex, but also hindered drainage and power transmission. Therefore, they will also be demolished soon.

Beijing has a large construction task. In urban construction, if certain units do not act in accordance with the overall plan, it will inevitably cause many adverse consequences. It is hoped that all units will pay attention to this issue. The competent authorities and the Beijing Municipal Planning Bureau should also effectively strengthen supervision to prevent all acts of indiscriminately building houses that damage the overall plan.

### 地质部等单位破坏首都建设规划乱盖房屋

    地质部等单位破坏首都建设规划乱盖房屋编辑同志：
    今年六月，地质部没有经过有关主管部门批准，私自在复兴门外三里河区域建筑了宿舍三十六间，汽车房十二间，建筑面积共约八百平方公尺。建筑时虽然用了一部分地质部自有的材料，仍花了人工费和材料费一万七千多元。但是，这个区域，已经由北京市规划管理局做好总体规划，并且已由前政务院房屋管理委员会（现为国务院机关事务管理局房产处）统一征购了建筑用地，准备为中央级机关建筑办公楼和宿舍。地质部这批房屋，却正好建在两个办公楼和一个宿舍楼的位置上。目前这个地段修建办公楼的施工准备工作已经全部就绪，原计划在九月二十七日动工。由于地质部拒绝把这批私自建筑、打乱总体规划的房屋拆除，以致到今天还无法动工。施工单位每天因为窝工而损失的工资就达三百六十元。
    另外，在这个地区，第二机械工业部和国家建设委员会也都没有经过有关主管部门的同意就修建了很多房屋。这些房子盖得非常零乱，不仅破坏了总体规划和整个建筑群的美观，而且彼此妨碍排水和输电，因此，在不久之后也要被拆除。
    北京的建筑任务很大。在都市建设中，如果某些单位不按总体规划办事，必然要造成许多恶果。希望各单位共同注意这个问题。各主管部门和北京市规划管理局也应该有效地加强监督工作，防止一切破坏总体规划而乱盖房屋的行为。伊明
