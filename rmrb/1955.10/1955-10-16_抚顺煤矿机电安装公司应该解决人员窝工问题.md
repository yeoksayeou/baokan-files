To the Editor:

At the Fushun Coal Mine Electrical and Mechanical Installation Company, the ratio of management personnel (not including security and materials staff) to workers is one to three. Many management personnel only work two or three hours a day. In the first half of this year, the company's administrative expenses exceeded the plan by 84 percent.

Why is this the case? The main reason is that the company's construction sites are scattered and the workload is small. The company's three hundred or so workers are scattered in areas such as Hegang, Beipiao, Fushun, Beijing, and Jiaozuo for long-term construction, so administrative management agencies are established everywhere, and management personnel also increase accordingly. The processing plant originally planned to have more than 3,000 tons of work this year, but only completed 240 tons of work in the first and second quarters of this year. This factory has only fifty direct production workers, but it is equipped with more than twenty management personnel.

The higher-level leading authority of the company—the Basic Construction Administration Bureau of the former Coal Mine Management Bureau—should bear the main responsibility for this problem. The task of the Fushun Coal Mine Electrical and Mechanical Installation Company is to contract the equipment installation of various newly built mines. However, the Basic Construction Bureaus of the Coal Mine Management Bureau in various regions have their own installation teams. The installation tasks of many newly built mines are mostly the responsibility of each team. The Fushun Coal Mine Electrical and Mechanical Installation Company can often only contract some odd jobs. This inevitably leads to scattered company construction sites and manpower waste.

We believe that this situation should be changed quickly. It is suggested that the scale of the installation teams of the basic construction bureaus in various regions be reduced, and the task of mine equipment installation be completely handed over to the electrical and mechanical installation company; or the electrical and mechanical installation company be abolished, and the personnel and equipment be supplemented to the installation teams in various regions.

### 抚顺煤矿机电安装公司应该解决人员窝工问题

    抚顺煤矿机电安装公司应该解决人员窝工问题编辑同志：
    在抚顺煤矿机电安装公司，管理人员（保卫、材料工作人员还不算在内）同工人的比例是一比三。许多管理人员每天只做两三个小时的工作。今年上半年，公司的行政管理费的开支超过计划百分之八十四。
    为什么会这样呢？主要是公司的工地分散，工作量小。公司的三百多个工人，长期分散在鹤岗、北票、抚顺、北京、焦作等地区施工，因此行政管理机构随着到处设立，管理人员也就随着增加。加工厂今年原计划有三千多吨的工作任务，结果今年第一、二季度只干了二百四十吨的活。这个厂只有五十名直接生产的工人，却配备了二十多个管理人员。
    对于这个问题，公司的上级领导机关——原煤矿管理总局基本建设管理局是应该负主要责任的。抚顺煤矿机电安装公司的任务是承包各新建矿井的设备安装。但是，煤矿管理总局基本建设管理局所属各地区的基本建设局都设有安装队，许多新建矿井的安装任务大部分都由各队自行负责，抚顺煤矿机电安装公司往往只能承包一些零星工程。这样就必然造成公司工地分散，人员窝工等现象。
    我们认为，这种情况应该迅速改变。建议把各地区基本建设局的安装队规模缩小，把矿井设备安装的任务全部交给机电安装公司；或者撤销机电安装公司，把人员设备充实到各地区的安装队去。
