    Soviet science serves the cause of peace and human progress. Soviet scientists have carried out large-scale work and made significant contributions in order to conquer nature and benefit mankind.
    Thanks to the efforts of Soviet scientists, the world's first nuclear power plant was built in the Soviet Union in June last year. It opened a new century in human history - the atomic age. Mankind has since tamed a new and unlimited source of energy that can be used to develop a high level of civilization. In the year since the nuclear power plant was built, it has generated more than 15 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. Throughout its operation, the situation has been satisfactory. At the same time, atomic energy has also been widely used in various sectors of the Soviet national economy and other fields. It is playing an increasingly important role in the economic life of the Soviet Union and bringing more and more benefits to the Soviet people.
    Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, once summarized the tasks of Soviet scientists in this area: We are on the eve of a great technological and economic revolution, and we have entered the atomic age. Our task is to fully promote the widespread and in-depth application of all the potential offered by current nuclear science and nuclear industry in science, technology, agriculture, and medicine.
    The progress and achievements of the Soviet Union in atomic energy science are of great significance to the people of all countries. Because the Soviet Union does not monopolize advanced scientific knowledge and experience, but is willing to make them public for the benefit of the people of all countries. The Soviet Union has now planned to build an experimental atomic reactor with a heat output of 6,500 kilowatts - which can be increased to 10,000 kilowatts if necessary - for our country. At the same time, the Soviet Union will also design and build experimental atomic reactors with a heat output of 2,000 kilowatts and cyclotron accelerators that can obtain particles with energies up to 25 million electron volts for Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the German Democratic Republic. The design work for these atomic piles has now begun. When building these atomic piles, the Soviet Union will supply all the necessary tools and equipment, Soviet experts will help to start up and put the atomic piles and accelerators into production, and will also help manage them. This assistance from the Soviet Union enables these countries to rapidly develop research on nuclear energy, widely use radioactive isotopes for the needs of medicine, biology, and other sciences and engineering, and train the necessary scientists and technical personnel for the development of the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    The Soviet Union not only provides material and technical assistance to various people's democratic countries in the research work on the peaceful use of atomic energy, but also expresses its willingness to consider providing similar assistance to other countries. At the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy held in Geneva not long ago, the Soviet Union submitted more than 100 reports to many countries - including countries with different social systems - summarizing the work of the Soviet Union in applying atomic energy to physics, biology, engineering, chemistry, technology, medicine, and industrial and agricultural production. The Swedish newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" once wrote: "The Soviet representatives greatly surprised their Western counterparts, reporting on a large number of nuclear fission experiments that were previously considered highly secret." The Soviet representatives' candid and selfless actions and sincere desire to promote international scientific cooperation greatly contributed to the positive results of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, thereby promoting international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy.
    Soviet scientists are not only engaged in extensive work in the research of atomic energy, but also in other scientific fields. They are tirelessly exploring and mastering the secrets of nature in order to benefit mankind and promote the progress of the world. This is evidenced by some important scientific activities of Soviet scientists in the recent period.
    In the sparsely populated Arctic region, Soviet scientists are persisting in their work during the second polar night without daylight, braving snowstorms and the threat of ice hills. In the past year or so, they have collected a large amount of material on the climate, seabed structure, ice and seawater conditions in the newly established drifting scientific stations, and have conducted a large amount of research on Arctic magnetic phenomena, solar radiation heat, and other natural phenomena. The results of these scientific research works will not only create favorable conditions for the development of the Soviet Arctic region's economy, but also for opening up the shortest route from the Eastern Hemisphere to the Western Hemisphere at the northern end of the world.
    In order to participate in the activities of the Third International Geophysical Year (July 1957 to the end of 1958), the Soviet Academy of Sciences is actively preparing and has established a special joint committee headed by Vice President Bardin. As part of its participation in this event, the Soviet Academy of Sciences will soon exhibit a comprehensive scientific expedition team, which will travel across the oceans to Antarctica to conduct geophysical research work. This expedition team, led by the famous Soviet polar researcher Somov, will establish three scientific stations in Antarctica in order to conduct comprehensive scientific research on meteorology, geomagnetism, polar light, ionosphere, solar radiation, cosmic rays, and glaciology. The scientists of the expedition team will also compile the natural geography of Antarctica and materials on the characteristics of Antarctic ice sheets and geology, the history of Antarctica, and the biogeographic characteristics of Antarctica. When conducting research work, Soviet scientists will cooperate with scientists from the United States, Britain, France, and other countries that also have scientific stations in Antarctica. The research and exploration work of scientists will enable mankind to gradually master this continent with an area of 14 million square kilometers, of which many aspects are still unknown.
    In the increasingly attention-grabbing field of interstellar travel, the research work of Soviet scientists is also making rapid progress. The fact that the Soviet Union recently announced the establishment of a permanent committee on interstellar communication shows that in the Soviet Union, the problem of conquering the universe, especially the problem of building "artificial satellites," is about to enter the practical stage from the planning and research stage. The great achievements that the Soviet Union has already achieved in ballistics, gas dynamics, jet engine technology, and directional movement, as well as the progress in the research and development of atomic energy power, have prepared favorable conditions for solving the complex problems of launching artificial satellites.
    For many centuries, people have left the earth to fly to that mysterious and unpredictable space world, which has always been only a bizarre dream and a beautiful myth. Sixty years ago, the great Russian scientist Tsiolkovsky predicted: "Man will not stay on Earth forever, but will explore the world and space, initially cautiously crossing the boundaries of the atmosphere, and then conquering the entire space near the sun." Now, the realization of this human dream predicted by Tsiolkovsky is not far away.
    These fruitful scientific activities of Soviet scientists have enriched the treasure house of human knowledge, tapped the infinite treasures of nature, and opened up a bright and brilliant prospect for the people of all countries to master nature and use the power of nature to benefit themselves.
    But people see that in some other countries, science is pursuing completely opposite goals. An American physicist, Philip Morrison, wrote in 1946: "American science will appear to the world as the creator of a new and more terrible weapon of war." The facts in recent years have proved this. In the United States, the appropriations for the development of atomic energy have exceeded 10 billion US dollars, and the result is only the renewal and expansion of weapons of murder, and the welfare of the people has not been improved in the slightest. The American "Baltimore Sun" also mentioned this fact when reporting on the Geneva International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy not long ago, it wrote: "Many American scientists believe that the United States could and should have made much greater progress in this area than it has achieved. The efforts of the United States are mainly used for the military purpose of atomic energy...too little is used for non-military research."
    When science is still in the hands of those who disregard human welfare and pursue war profits in some countries, the work of Soviet scientists, whose mission is to promote the advancement of human society, improve the welfare of the people, and maintain the cause of peace, becomes even more meaningful.

    苏联科学为和平和人类进步服务
    苏新
    为和平和人类的进步服务，是苏联科学的崇高目标。苏联科学家为了征服自然，造福人类，进行了巨大规模的工作，并作出了重大的贡献。
    由于苏联科学家们的努力，世界上第一个原子能发电站去年六月在苏联建成了。它揭开了人类历史上的新的世纪——原子能世纪的序幕。人类从此驯伏了一种新的无限量的能源，可以用来为发展高度的文明服务。在原子能发电站建成以后的一年多来，它已经发出了一千五百多万瓩时的电力。在它的整个工作期间，情况都是令人满意的。与此同时，原子能在苏联国民经济各部门和其他各个方面也得到了广泛的应用。它在苏联的经济生活中，正起着愈来愈大的作用，并给苏联人民带来了愈来愈多的利益。
    苏联科学院院长湼斯米扬诺夫曾经这样概括了苏联科学家在这方面的任务：我们正处在伟大的技术经济革命的前夕，我们已经进入了原子时代。我们的任务是全力促进目前核子科学和核子工业所提供的全部潜能在科学、技术、农业和医学中得到广泛和深入的运用。
    苏联在原子能科学上的进展和成就，对于各国人民都有重大的意义。因为苏联并不垄断先进的科学知识和经验，而愿意把它们公开出来为各国人民的福利服务。苏联现在已经计划为我国建立一个发热量达六千五百瓩——在必要时可以提高到一万瓩——的实验性原子反应堆。同时，苏联也将为波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚和德意志民主共和国设计和建造具有两千瓩发热量的实验性原子反应堆，和能获得高达二千五百万电子伏特的能量的粒子的回旋加速器。这些原子堆的设计工作现在已经开始。在建立这些原子堆的时候，苏联将供给全部必要的工具和装置，苏联的专家将帮助使原子堆和加速器开动和投入生产，并且还将帮助管理它们。苏联的这种援助，使这些国家有可能迅速地发展对核子能的研究，广泛利用放射性同位素于医学、生物学和其他各门科学和工程学的需要，并为发展原子能和平用途而训练必要的科学家和技术干部。
    苏联不仅对各人民民主国家在原子能和平利用的研究工作方面提供物质的和技术的帮助，而且也表示愿意考虑给予其他国家以类似的帮助。不久以前在日内瓦举行的和平利用原子能国际会议上，苏联曾经向许多国家——包括不同社会制度的国家在内——提出了一百多份报告，分别总结了苏联把原子能应用在物理学、生物学、工程学、化学、工艺学、医学和工农业生产方面的工作。瑞典报纸“瑞典日报”曾经这样写道：“苏联代表使他们的西方同行大为吃惊，苏联代表报告了大量的、至今被认为是非常秘密的关于原子核分裂试验的情况。”苏联代表这种坦率无私的行动和促进国际科学合作的真诚愿望，在很大的程度上促使和平利用原子能国际会议获得积极的结果，从而促进在和平利用原子能方面的国际合作。
    苏联科学家们不仅在原子能的研究工作方面，而且也在其他的科学领域中进行着广泛的工作。他们孜孜不倦地在探测和掌握自然的秘奥，以造福人类和推动世界前进。这从苏联科学家在最近期间的一些重要的科学活动中得到证明。
    在人迹罕到的北极地带，苏联科学家正在第二个没有白昼的北极夜中冒着风雪的袭击和冰丘的威胁而坚持着自己的工作。在过去的一年多内，他们在新建立的几个漂流科学站中已收集了大量有关北极地区的气候、海底结构、冰和海水的情况的材料，并且对北极磁性现象、太阳放射热以及其他的自然现象进行了大量的研究。这些科学研究工作的成果，不仅将为发展苏联北极地区的经济，而且也将为在世界的北端开辟从东半球到西半球的最短的航线创造有利的条件。
    为了参加第三次国际地球物理学年度（一九五七年七月到一九五八年底）的活动，苏联科学院正在进行积极的准备工作，并已成立了以巴尔金副院长为首的一个专门联合委员会。作为参加这次活动的一部分，苏联科学院将在最近展出一个综合性科学考察队，远涉重洋前往南极地区进行地球物理学的研究工作。这个由苏联著名的极地研究家索美夫领导的考察队，将在南极洲建立三个科学站，以便对气象学、地磁学、极地光、电离层、太阳辐射、宇宙线和冰河学等方面的问题进行综合的科学研究。考察队的科学家们还要编写南极的自然地理和关于南极的冰层、地质的特性、南极区的历史、南极的生物地理特性等材料。在进行研究工作时，苏联科学家将同也在南极洲建有科学站的美、英、法等国家的科学家们合作。科学家的研究和探测工作将使人类能够逐渐掌握这个面积广达一千四百万平方公里、迄今有很多方面的情况仍在未知之中的大陆。
    在愈来愈受到人们注意的星际交通方面，苏联科学家们的研究工作也正在获得迅速的进展。不久以前苏联宣布成立星际交通常设委员会的事实说明，在苏联，征服宇宙的问题，首先是建造“人造卫星”的问题，即将从计划、研究的阶段进入实践的阶段了。苏联在射击学、气体动力学、喷气发动技术和定向运动方面所已经获得的巨大成就，以及在原子能动力的研究工作方面的进展，为解决发射人造卫星的各项复杂问题准备了有利的条件。
    许多个世纪以来，人们离开地球飞行到那个神幻莫测的太空世界中去，一直只是离奇的梦想和美丽的神话。六十年前，伟大的俄国科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基预言：“人不会永远停留在地球上，而要去探索世界和空间，最初是小心翼翼地越出大气层的界限，然后便去征服太阳附近的整个空间”。现在，实现齐奥尔科夫斯基预言的这个人类梦想，已经为期不远了。
    苏联科学家的这些富有成果的科学活动，丰富了人类知识的宝库，发掘着自然界的无限宝藏，在各国人民的面前打开了掌握自然、利用自然的力量来为自己造福的光辉灿烂的远景。
    但是人们看到，在别的一些国家里，科学却追求着截然相反的目的。美国的一位物理学家菲利浦·莫利逊在一九四六年这样写道：“美国科学将以一个新的更可怖的战争武器制造者的面目出现于世界。”几年来的事实正是这样证明的。在美国，用于发展原子能的拨款已超过一百亿美元，结果只是杀人武器的更新和扩充，而人民的福利并没有丝毫增进。美国“巴尔的摩太阳报”不久以前在报道和平利用原子能日内瓦国际会议时也提到了这个事实，它写道：“有许多美国科学家认为，美国在这方面本来是能够而且应该取得比目前所取得的大得多的进展的。美国的努力主要是用在原子能的军事用途上了……用于非军事研究方面的太少。”
    当科学在一些国家内还掌握在那些不顾人类福利和追求战争利润的人的手里时，苏联科学家以推动人类社会前进、提高人民福利和维护和平事业为使命的工作就显得更其有意义了。
