Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, October 20th: More than 3,000 people from all walks of life in Lhasa held a grand rally and ribbon-cutting ceremony on the 20th to celebrate the opening of the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways.

    The venue for the rally was west of the Potala Palace, where the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Qinghai-Tibet Highway was held last year. Attending the rally were secular and religious officials of the Tibetan local government, officials and staff of the Panchen Kampot Conference Hall Committee and the Changdu Regional People's Liberation Committee in Lhasa, as well as mass organizations, citizens, lamas and suburban farmers of Lhasa, and cadres of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and troops stationed in Lhasa.

    At 3 p.m., the opening ceremony began. Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Kalon of the Tibetan local government, and Renxi Danlun·Tseren Banjue, of the Panchen Kampot Conference Hall Committee, spoke successively. They warmly congratulated the full opening of the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways and paid tribute to the workers, soldiers, and laborers who built the two highways. Tan Guansan said: The Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways connect the main cities and towns such as Lhasa, Rikaze, and Gyantse, which creates more favorable conditions for strengthening internal unity in Tibet, promoting Tibet's economy, and closely linking the mainland and Tibet. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said: Following the opening of the Kangzang and Qinghai-Tibet highways, the victorious opening of the Lhasa-Rikaze and Rikaze-Gyantse highways has made the Tibetan people more deeply understand the brilliance and correctness of the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, the great leader Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, appreciate the warmth and loveliness of the great family of the motherland where all ethnic groups are united, friendly, and cooperative, and more clearly see the bright future of the Tibetan people, so that they will be more confident in creating their own happy lives.

    Afterwards, the rally read out the congratulatory message from the Tibetan local government to Chairman Mao and the State Council.

    After the rally, the ribbon-cutting ceremony began amidst the band playing the Victory March and the long horns of the lamas. Tan Guansan and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme cut the ribbons in warm applause, and twenty cars participating in the opening ceremony slowly drove out of the ribbon gate. Thirty Tibetan and Han girls and Tibetan elementary school students wearing new clothes and colorful skirts presented Hadas to the portrait of Chairman Mao on the float on behalf of the people of all walks of life and presented flowers to the drivers. Amidst the long cheers of the people, the motorcade, led by the float, drove westward along the Lhasa-Rikaze highway.

    That afternoon, the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army jointly held a celebration banquet. Religious and secular officials of the Tibetan local government, officials and staff of the Panchen Kampot Conference Hall Committee and the Changdu Regional People's Liberation Committee in Lhasa, representatives of the three major monasteries in Lhasa, and mass organizations in Lhasa attended the banquet.

    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, October 20th: At 10 a.m. on the 20th, the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Lhasa-Rikaze highway was held on the banks of the Nyang Chu River in the suburbs of Rikaze. Today, five-star national flags were hung along the streets of Rikaze City, and a flow of people more than one kilometer long gathered along the eastern suburban highway, lined with citizens dressed in festive new clothes, farmers from the surrounding rural areas, officials of the Panchen Kampot Conference Hall Committee and the Tibetan local government stationed in Rikaze, the Buddhist band and honor guard of Tashilhunpo Monastery, and the Yangko team of the People's Liberation Army stationed there, totaling more than 10,000 people.

    When the motorcade from Lhasa drove across the Nyang Chu River, the band and the lamas' drums and horns sounded in unison. Liang Xuanxian, Secretary of the Rikaze Sub-Committee of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Jiantong·Jijinmei, Director of the Panchen Kampot Conference Hall Committee, cut the ribbons.

    Attending the ribbon-cutting ceremony were Xia Zhongyuan, representative of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Renxi Duode·Awang Zeren, representative of the Tibetan local government. After the ribbon-cutting, Kong·Guanjia, representative of the Panchen Erdeni, presented a "Lang Co" Hada (the most honorable Hada) more than ten feet long to the portrait of Chairman Mao on the float. After the Panchen Kampot Conference Hall Committee, officials of the Tibetan local government stationed in Rikaze, and the Tibetan people presented Hadas to the portrait of Chairman Mao on the float, the motorcade passed through the ribbon gate into the venue of the celebration rally amidst colorful confetti and cheering crowds on both sides of the road.
