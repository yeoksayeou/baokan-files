    CCP Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture Representative Conference
    Passes First Five-Year Plan for Developing Agricultural Cooperatives

    By next spring, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture will increase from 376 to more than 2,300, with cooperative member households accounting for 10.4 percent of the total number of households in the prefecture. By the end of 1957, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives will increase to more than 7,600, with cooperative member households accounting for more than 48 percent of the total number of households in the prefecture. This plan was discussed and approved at the First Representative Conference of the Chinese Communist Party Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture held recently.

    The autonomous prefecture completed the reform of the land system in the spring of 1952. By the autumn harvest this year, more than 36,900 mutual aid teams have been established throughout the prefecture, and 376 agricultural producers' cooperatives have been established on a trial basis. The organized farmers have had better harvests every year than ordinary farmers. The harvest of various crops managed by the 376 agricultural producers' cooperatives established on a trial basis this spring was much higher than that of the mutual aid teams, which has greatly promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the area. At present, more than 12,000 Miao and Han farmers in the autonomous prefecture have applied to join the cooperatives. The Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has transferred a large number of cadres to the remote mountains where Miao farmers live to help them establish cooperatives. The Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee is planning to transfer a group of literate Miao farmers for short-term training to help them learn the accounting business of agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    中共湘西苗族自治州代表会议
    通过发展农业合作社的第一个五年计划
    到明年春天，湘西苗族自治州的农业生产合作社将由三百七十六个发展到二千三百多个，入社农户将占全州总农户数的百分之十点四。到一九五七年年底，农业生产合作社就要发展到七千六百多个，入社农户将占全州总农户数的百分之四十八以上。这个计划是在最近召开的中国共产党湘西苗族自治州第一次代表会议上讨论通过的。
    自治州在一九五二年春天完成土地制度的改革，到今年秋收前，全州已建立了三万六千九百多个互助组，试办了三百七十六个农业生产合作社，组织起来的农户已占全州总农户数的百分之六十三点七。组织起来的农民每年都比一般农民的收成好，今年春天试办的三百七十六个农业生产合作社所经营的各种农作物的收获量，又比互助组所经营的高得多，这对促进当地开展互助合作运动影响很大。现在，自治州申请入社的苗、汉族农民已有一万二千多户。中共湘西苗族自治州地方委员会已抽调大批干部深入到苗族农民聚居的深山里，帮助他们建社。自治州人民委员会正计划抽调一批识字的苗族农民进行短期训练，帮助他们学会农业生产合作社的会计业务。（新华社）
