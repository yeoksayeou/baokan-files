    Implementing Non-Stop Runs Through Intermediate Stations, Exceeding Transportation Plans
    Liu Yan
    The employees of the Guye Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, in response to the call of the Ministry of Railways and the China Railway Trade Union, have launched an in-depth campaign of "Full Load, Over-Axle, Five Hundred Kilometers." In August, the bureau's loading task exceeded the original plan by 0.3 percent, and the tonnage of goods sent exceeded the plan by 1.6 percent; the locomotive's daily car kilometers completed 529.4 kilometers, exceeding the plan by 36.4 kilometers. All other indicators were also overfulfilled. Due to these achievements, this branch was awarded the Tianjin Railway Bureau's circulating red flag.
    The Guye Railway Branch's overfulfillment of transportation tasks is inseparable from the implementation of non-stop runs through intermediate stations. On June 4th of this year, locomotive driver Sun Hongduo of locomotive No. 1804 first piloted a non-stop run between Guye and Shanhaiguan. With the support of the dispatchers, the pilot was successful. This proves that non-stop runs through intermediate stations can be fully implemented between Guye and Shanhaiguan. In early July, according to the instructions of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the Guye Branch decided to organize non-stop runs through intermediate stations to accelerate the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock. In late July, a team composed of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the Guye Branch, and the Guye Locomotive Depot formally tested non-stop runs through intermediate stations between Guye and Shanhaiguan. Of the thirty-two trains tested in six days, twenty-four reached the terminal station. Subsequently, the Guye Branch immediately summarized this experience and promoted it.
    The promotion of non-stop runs through intermediate stations aroused the interest of train crews and dispatchers. Many people were preparing to participate in this movement. However, due to the fact that the up trains failed to complete seven times during the trial, some people had ideological concerns, believing that: downhill is possible, uphill is not, the water is not enough. They were afraid that the quality of the vehicles was not good, that the signals were not good, and so on. The Party General Branch Committee studied the above situation and believed that the emergence of this concern was mainly because they were afraid of accidents and being punished. The General Branch Committee decided that in addition to continuing to persuade and mobilize, it would require the administrative side to make the greatest efforts to specifically solve the key problem of water use on the uphill slope from Shanhaiguan to Guye, and to cultivate typical examples for demonstration. The railway branch also instructed various departments to closely cooperate to ensure the success of this work.
    With the specific help of the Party and the administration, locomotive No. 1804 took the lead in the experiment again. The first technical problem they encountered was water consumption. Sun Hongduo's team adopted the Soviet Union's advanced experience of high-temperature water injection to reduce the number of times the water pump was switched on and off, thereby reducing water loss during injection. In the past, about 150 water injections were required for one run between Shanhaiguan and Guye, but now only eight are needed. At the same time, the water tank is filled before departure, and the locomotive departs from the depot immediately, reducing the number of times water and steam are released in the middle to adjust the boiler water and steam. But this was not enough; it was also necessary to improve the quality of the locomotives and the operating skills of the crew to increase travel speed and save water. In this regard, they adopted three advanced operating methods: Xu Xingwang's locomotive maintenance method, Tang Likai's section sampling method, and Wang Yimin's firing method. They also familiarized themselves with the line conditions and train conditions, and were able to use them freely when starting, stopping, going uphill, and downhill, how to inject water and add steam, and how to use inertia. At the end of July, they also took the lead in completing the non-stop run through intermediate stations from Shanhaiguan to Guye, and had more than two tons of water left when they reached the terminal station.
    In August, the Guye Railway Branch comprehensively promoted non-stop runs through intermediate stations on the down line between Tianjin and Guye and the up and down lines between Guye and Xinhe. The results were all successful. Sun Hongduo's crew, in close cooperation with the dispatchers, created the remarkable achievement of starting from Nancang, running 158 kilometers, and passing through two watering stations without stopping to reach Guye Station. These facts educated and encouraged all employees. Now, all the locomotives in the Guye Branch, except for one with poor quality, are implementing non-stop runs through intermediate stations.
    As a result of the Guye Branch's implementation of non-stop runs through intermediate stations, the daily car kilometers in August increased by 44.8 kilometers compared to the average for the first half of the year. The travel speed of non-stop trains increased by 8 kilometers compared to the travel speed stipulated for general section freight trains. The 289 trains tested in August arrived a total of 157.7 train hours early, which is equivalent to a train traveling 6,500 kilometers. In addition, according to preliminary estimates, coal consumption was also reduced by 115 tons compared to before.
    In September, this movement has been popularized to the up and down lines of each section between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan. The number of trains running has exceeded August by 27 percent. At present, in order to prepare for winter transportation, the Guye Locomotive Depot has organized 56 "Five Hundred Kilometers" drivers to study the favorable and unfavorable conditions of winter operation, and has taken some measures to ensure the smooth development of this movement.

    实行中间站不停车运行，超额完成运输计划
    刘岩
    天津铁路管理局古冶分局的职工们，响应铁道部和中国铁路工会的号召，深入开展了“满载、超轴、五百公里”的运动。八月份，全局的装车任务超过了原计划百分之零点三，货物发送吨数超过计划百分之一点六；机车日车公里完成五二九点四公里，超过计划三六点四公里。其它各项指标，也都超额完成了。由于这些成就，这个分局获得了天津铁路管理局循环红旗的奖励。
    古冶铁路分局超额完成运输任务是和推行中间站不停车运行分不开的。今年六月四日，一八○四号机车司机孙鸿铎首先由古冶到山海关间试行中间站不停车运行。在调度员们的支持下，试行成功了。这证明从古冶到山海关间完全可以实行中间站不停车运行。七月初，根据天津铁路管理局的指示，古冶分局决定组织中间站实行不停车运行，以加速机车车辆的周转。七月下旬，由天津铁路管理局、古冶分局和古冶机务段组成的小组，正式在古冶到山海关间试验中间站实行不停车运行。在六天里试行的三十二列车中，有二十四列到达了终点站。接着，古冶分局立即总结了这一经验，加以推广。
    推广中间站不停车运行，引起了乘务员和调度员们的兴趣。许多人都准备参加到这个运动中来。但是，由于试行中上行列车有七次没有完成，一些人有思想顾虑，认为：下行可以，上行不成，水不够用。他们怕车辆的质量不好，怕信号不好，等等。党总支委员会研究了上述情况，认为这种顾虑的产生，主要是他们怕出事故受处分。总支委员会决定除了继续进行说服动员外，要求行政方面尽最大努力，具体解决山海关到古冶上行坡道用水的关键问题，并养培典型，进行示范。铁路分局也指示各部门紧密配合，保证这一工作的成功。
    在党和行政具体的帮助下，一八○四号机车又带头进行了试验。他们在技术上遇到的第一个问题是用水问题。孙鸿铎班采取了苏联高温注水的先进经验，以减少水泵开关次数，从而减少了注水时的溢水损耗。过去在山海关、古冶间运行一次要注水一百五十次左右，现在只须八次。同时做到发车前水柜满水，机车出库立即发车，中途减少为调整锅炉水、汽的放水次数。但这还不够，还必须提高机车质量，提高乘务员的操纵技术，以提高旅行速度，节约用水。在这方面，他们采用了三种先进操作法：徐兴旺的机车保养法、唐立凯的区间采点法，和王宜民烧火法。他们还摸熟线路情况和列车情况，在起车、停车、上坡、下坡时如何注水加汽，如何利用惰力，都运用自如。七月底，他们又首先完成了从山海关到古冶间的中间站不停车运行，到终点站时还剩两吨多水。
    八月份，古冶铁路分局便在天津、古冶间的下行线和古冶、新河间的上、下行线全面推行中间站不停车运行。结果都成功了。孙鸿铎机班在调度员们的密切配合下，创造了由南仓始发，运行一百五十八公里，通过两个给水站而不停车到达古冶站的卓越成绩。这些事实教育并鼓舞全体职工。现在，古冶分局的机车中除一台质量不好的以外，都实行了中间站不停车运行。
    古冶分局开展中间站不停车运行的结果，八月份日车公里比上半年平均提高了四十四点八公里。不停车列车的旅行速度比一般区段货车规定的旅行速度提高了八公里。八月份试行的二八九个列车共计早点到达一百五十七点七个列车小时，等于一个列车旅行了六千五百公里。此外，根据初步估计，用煤量也比以前少用一百一十五吨。
    九月份，这个运动已普及到了天津、山海关间的各区段的上下行线。运行列车数已超过八月份百分之二十七。目前，为了作好冬季运输，古冶机务段已组织了五十六名“五百公里”司机，研究冬季运行的有利条件和不利条件，并采取了一些措施，以保证这个运动顺利发展。
