Congratulating the Opening of "Indian Republic Film Week"
Xia Yan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China

October is a joyous and unforgettable month, and this October's joy is especially memorable for us.

October is the season of harvest, and this year our country has achieved bumper harvests in all aspects, including our artistic garden.

What makes us particularly happy and beneficial is that more than ten art delegations from ten countries are performing in China, with dazzling brilliance, leaving us overwhelmed. Every Chinese artist believes this is a rare opportunity for observation and learning in their lifetime. And in such an artistic season filled with peace and friendship, the film delegation from our friendly neighbor, the Republic of India, has arrived in Beijing, and the Indian Republic Film Week, held simultaneously in twenty major cities in our country, is about to open today.

Because film is the most popular art form and the most expressive art form, introducing the most outstanding films that truly reflect the life, ideals, and struggles of the Indian people to the Chinese people, and allowing hundreds of thousands of Chinese film audiences who harbor love and goodwill towards the Indian people to meet and talk with outstanding Indian film artists, is not only a major event in the cultural life of our two peoples, but also a deeper and more effective promotion of mutual understanding, mutual support, and mutual learning between the Chinese and Indian peoples, thereby strengthening the friendly cooperation between the nearly one billion people of China and India, and defending the peace of Asia and the world, which is a major event in our political life. In this sense, we believe that the Indian film delegation is an artistic envoy, a friendly envoy, and a peace envoy sent to China by the Indian government and people, and the Indian Republic Film Week is also a "Friendship Week" for the nearly one billion people of our two countries.

In this film week, we will screen four excellent Indian films: "The Art and Construction of India," "Two Acres of Land," "The Vagabond," and "The Storm." These four films all have a high level of artistry and distinct and strong national characteristics. For our Chinese film artists, they are all works worth learning from.

The documentary "The Art and Construction of India" introduces the past and present of India, this ancient yet young great country, with vivid images and a lively approach. It not only allows us to see the art of sculpture, painting, pottery, and casting of India with its 5,000-year cultural tradition, hear the songs of South India, and see the magnificent Ajanta temples and the relics of the Seven Pagodas, but also introduces us to the great efforts of the Indian people to fight against natural disasters after independence. India is a great country, and the Indian people are hardworking, brave, and intelligent people. India has its glorious past, and India will surely have an even more splendid tomorrow. This documentary can help us further understand India, because each of its themes is a wonderful travelogue, a gorgeous, poetic prose.

"Two Acres of Land," "The Vagabond," and "The Storm" are three story films with different themes and styles, but they have a common characteristic, that is, they all strive to truthfully reflect the life and aspirations of the Indian people with a lofty humanitarian spirit and a rigorous realistic method. As the Soviet artist G. Roshal said: "These films vividly express the real experiences of people, thereby opposing those things that bind ordinary people from childhood and prevent them from exerting their strength. These are unfair laws, outdated moral standards, and caste divisions, etc. Opposed to all this is the unity of the working people and their mutual help in difficult times." Indian film artists have strengthened and enriched the film's infectious power with vivid images and artistic forms rich in national characteristics. Therefore, when our Chinese audiences see stories that take place in remote places, they will feel exceptionally cordial and excited.

Holding the Indian Republic Film Week in China is the first time, and the four films currently being screened are only the first batch of many excellent Indian films. We hope to see the historical story film "The Queen of Jhansi," which depicts the Indian peasants' anti-British struggle a hundred years ago, and we also hope to see "The Traveler," which depicts the lives of Assam tea plantation workers. Of course, we also hope to often see documentaries that reflect the Indian people's labor and struggle to build their beautiful lives. The holding of the Indian Republic Film Week and the visit of the Indian Republic film delegation should only be said to be the beginning of film and art exchanges between China and India. There is no doubt that with the strengthening and development of friendly cooperation between the governments and peoples of China and India, the exchange of film and art between our two countries will become more frequent and closer day by day and year by year.

We sincerely welcome the visit of the film delegation of the Republic of India, and we warmly wish the Indian Republic Film Week a great success.

    祝“印度共和国电影周”开幕
    中华人民共和国文化部副部长　夏衍
    十月是欢乐的、难忘的月份，今年十月的欢乐特别使我们难忘。
    十月是收获的季节，今年我国在各方面都得到了丰收，包括我们艺术的园地在内。
    特别使我们高兴和得到益处的，是十个国家的十个以上的艺术代表团在中国演出，璀璨光辉，目不暇给，中国的每一个文艺工作者都认为这是自己一生中不可多得的观摩学习的机会。而正在这样一个洋溢着和平、友好气氛的艺术季节中，来自我们友好邻邦——印度共和国的电影代表团已经到了北京，在我国二十个大城市同时举行的印度共和国电影周就要在今天开幕了。
    由于电影是最富于群众性的艺术，是表现力最强的艺术，所以，把最优秀的、真实地反映了印度人民的生活、理想和斗争的影片广泛地介绍给中国人民，让成千上万的、对印度人民怀抱着友爱和善意的中国电影观众和印度卓越的电影艺术工作者们见面和交谈，就不仅是我们两国人民文化生活中的一件大事，而且是更深入、更有效地促进中印两国人民的相互了解、相互支持、相互学习，借以加强中印两国近十亿人民的友好合作，保卫亚洲和世界和平的我们政治生活中的一件大事了。在这个意义上，我们认为印度电影代表团是印度政府和人民派遣到中国来的艺术使者，友好使者，和平使者，而印度共和国电影周也就是我们两国近十亿人民的“友好周”了。
    在这次电影周中，我们将放映“印度的艺术与建设”、“两亩地”、“流浪者”、“暴风雨”四部优秀的印度影片，这四部影片都具有高度的艺术水平，都具有鲜明而强烈的民族色彩，对我们中国的电影艺术工作者来说，也都是值得很好学习的作品。
    纪录片“印度的艺术与建设”以生动的形象和明快的手法，介绍了印度这个古老而又年轻的伟大国家的昨日和今天。它不仅使我们看到了具有五千年文化传统的印度的雕刻、绘画、陶塑和铸造的艺术，使我们听到南印度的歌声，看到壮丽的阿旃陀寺院和七塔岛的遗迹，而且向我们介绍了独立以后的印度人民和自然灾害作斗争的巨大的努力。印度是一个伟大的国家，印度人民是勤劳、勇敢、智慧的人民。印度有它光辉的过去，印度也必将有它更灿烂的明天。这部纪录影片可以帮助我们更进一步地认识印度，了解印度，因为它的每一个主题都是一篇美妙的游记，都是绚烂的、诗一般的散文。
    “两亩地”、“流浪者”和“暴风雨”是三部主题不同，风格不同的故事影片，但是它们有一个共同的特征，这就是它们都以崇高的人道主义的精神，谨严的现实主义的方法，力求真实地反映出印度人民的生活和愿望。正如苏联艺术家格·罗沙里所说：“这些影片生动地表现了人的真实的经历，从而反对那些使普通人从小就受到束缚、就使他们不能施展自己力量的东西。这就是不公平的法律、陈腐的道德标准和种姓的划分等等。同这一切相对立的，那就是劳动人民的团结和他们在艰难时刻的相互帮助。”印度电影艺术家们用鲜明的形象和富有民族色彩的艺术形式，加强和丰富了影片的感染力量，因此，当我们中国观众看到尽管是发生在辽远地方的故事，也就会感到异常的亲切和激动。
    在中国举行印度共和国电影周还是第一次，现在放映的四部影片也只还是许多优秀的印度影片中的第一批。我们希望能看到表现了一百年前印度农民反英斗争的历史故事片“章西女王”，我们也希望看到描写了阿萨姆茶园工人生活的“旅行者”，当然我们也希望经常能看到反映着印度人民为建设自己美好生活而劳动、而斗争的纪录影片。印度共和国电影周的举行和印度共和国电影代表团的来访，只应该说是中印两国电影艺术交流的一个开端。毫无疑问，随着中印两国政府和人民之间的友好合作的加强和发展，我们两国电影艺术的交流一定会一天比一天频繁，一年比一年紧密。
    我们衷心地欢迎印度共和国电影代表团的来访，我们热烈地预祝印度共和国电影周的巨大成功。
