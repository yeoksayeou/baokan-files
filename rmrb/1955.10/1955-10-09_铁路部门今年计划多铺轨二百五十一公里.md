Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    This year, in addition to completing the planned construction of 1,050 kilometers of new railways, the railway department will lay an additional 251 kilometers of railway.
    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was originally scheduled to lay track to Zhangye this year. Now, it has been decided to extend the track westward from Zhangye by 108 kilometers to 4 kilometers west of Xusanwan, only a little over 100 kilometers from Yumen. The northern section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, originally planned to begin construction next year, has now been decided to begin construction earlier this year, laying 26 kilometers of track. The southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was originally scheduled to lay track to Lueyang this year, but it has now been decided to extend it by 16 kilometers northward to Xujiaping. In addition, 59 kilometers of double track will be laid on the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the Changchun-Dalian Railway, and 10 kilometers of forest railway will be built in the Northeast.
    The Ministry of Railways has now issued an order instructing all engineering bureaus to complete this additional task entirely before the end of the year.
