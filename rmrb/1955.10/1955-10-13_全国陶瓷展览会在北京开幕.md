National Ceramics Exhibition Opens in Beijing

The "National Ceramics Exhibition," jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Local Industries, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives, and the Chinese Artists Association, opened on October 3rd in the Hall of Preserving Harmony (保和殿) of the Palace Museum in Beijing.

This is the first national ceramics exhibition since liberation. The exhibition features approximately 2,000 pieces, all products from the past three years, selected from nearly 10,000 new ceramic products sent from more than 40 producing areas in over 20 provinces and cities across the country. There are daily-use ceramics, artistic porcelain, and various ceramic sculptures.

Products from Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province are the most numerous on display. In recent years, the production of Jingdezhen ceramics has improved significantly in both quantity and quality, and precious colored glazes that had been lost for a long time, such as "Jun Red," "Wujin (Black Gold)," "Eel Yellow," and "Tea Dust," have been restored and developed. New products meticulously researched and designed by scientific researchers, art designers, and veteran craftsmen have attracted the attention of visitors. Daily-use porcelain such as tableware and tea sets produced in Fengxi, Gaobei, and Rao Ping in Guangdong, and Liling in Hunan, have improved in styling and colored glaze, and the costs are also lower, making them popular among the people. Production in the famous pottery producing areas of Yixing in Jiangsu and Shiwan in Guangdong has also turned from decline before liberation to prosperity. Yixing pottery has excellent soil quality and is delicate and beautiful. Sculptures of figures, birds, and animals created by art workers in Guangzhou and pottery artists in Shiwan are realistic and moving.

The exhibition has a sales area on-site to facilitate visitors' purchase of various ceramic wares.

    全国陶瓷展览会在北京开幕
    地方工业部、中华全国手工业生产合作社总社筹备委员会和中国美术家协会联合举办的“全国陶瓷展览会”，十月三日起在北京故宫博物院保和殿开始展出。
    这是解放后第一次全国性的陶瓷展览。展品约二千件，都是最近三年来的产品，是从全国二十多个省、市的四十多个产区送来的近万件陶瓷新产品中选出来的。有日用陶瓷、美术瓷和各种陶瓷雕塑品。
    江西景德镇的产品，展出最多。几年来，景德镇陶瓷的生产，在数量和质量上都有了不小的提高，失传很久的“钧红”、“乌金”、“鳝鱼黄”、“茶叶末”等名贵色釉获得了恢复和发展。科学研究工作者、美术设计工作者和老艺人们精心研究和设计创作的新产品，吸引了观众的注意。广东的枫溪、高陂、饶平和湖南的醴陵等地出产的日用瓷器如餐具、茶具等，造型和色釉，都有改进，成本也较低，受到人们的欢迎。著名的产陶地区江苏宜兴和广东石湾的生产，也都由解放前的衰落转入了繁荣，宜兴的陶器土质优良，细致美观；广州市美术工作者和石湾陶器艺人合作的人物、鸟兽等雕塑品，都真实动人。
    展览会在会场设有售品处，便于观众选购各种陶瓷器。
