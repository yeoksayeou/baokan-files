    Inherit the Great Legacy of Revolutionary Martyrs
    ——Speech at the Capital Youth Representatives' Visit to the Ren Bishi Comrade Memorial Hall
    Hu Yaobang
    The 27th was the fifth anniversary of Comrade Ren Bishi's passing. Everyone requested to visit the Ren Bishi Comrade Memorial Hall, wanting to learn something from Comrade Bishi's life. This is certainly a very meaningful thing.
    As everyone knows, our people have gone through an extremely arduous and difficult path from opposing foreign imperialist aggression and the oppression of domestic reactionary forces to the success of the New Democratic Revolution. From the Opium War to now, it has been one hundred and fifteen years. From the birth of the Chinese Communist Party to the founding of the People's Republic of China, there have been exactly twenty-eight years and three months. In these long days, thousands upon thousands of revolutionary martyrs contributed their precious lives for us and for our future generations. When we are cheering for the motherland's present, when we are singing passionately for our own future, we have not forgotten these revolutionary martyrs, and it is of course very proper and absolutely correct to cherish their memory.
    We should not only deeply appreciate them, but also fully understand what great legacy they left us. So what is the great legacy left by the revolutionary martyrs? I think the most important aspects are the following three:
    Revolutionary martyrs left us great revolutionary feats. That is to say, without them, without them and all the revolutionary elders leading the broad masses of our people in heroic struggle, our country would have long become a complete colony, and our people would have long been reduced to the most miserable slaves subjected to oppression, exploitation, and humiliation.
    Revolutionary martyrs left us a great revolutionary spirit. That is to say, they were able to regard the interests of the motherland and the broad masses of the people as the most sacred thing at all times and in all places, and were able to subordinate personal interests to the interests of the revolutionary cause. People always cherish their own lives, but when the interests of the revolution require it, they can unhesitatingly contribute their heads and blood.
    Revolutionary martyrs left us great revolutionary wisdom. That is to say, they were good at constantly pursuing revolutionary truth from actual struggles, and good at seeking the specific laws of the Chinese revolution in accordance with Marxism-Leninism. Comrades all know that it is precisely because of the countless revolutionary experiences of the revolutionary martyrs, which were constantly concentrated and elevated by our great leader Chairman Mao, that they became the science that guides the victory of our country's revolution, a combination of Marxism-Leninism and the specific practice of the Chinese revolution. There is no doubt that this science is of great significance for guiding us to build our country into a great socialist and communist society.
    The name of Comrade Ren Bishi is particularly dear to our generation of youth. Comrade Ren Bishi was an outstanding son of the Chinese people, an excellent leader of our Party, a close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, and a model and mentor for Chinese youth. Therefore, it is very important for us to come here today to learn about the valuable legacy left to us by Comrade Ren Bishi.
    First of all, we should learn from Comrade Bishi's heroic spirit of wholeheartedly and consistently serving the people. As everyone knows, from the age of sixteen until his pulse stopped beating, Comrade Bishi dedicated all his efforts to the revolution. Comrade Bishi never felt that he had contributed to the revolution and bargained for any position, never felt complacent because of his achievements in work, and never slackened in the slightest because of the progress of the revolution, truly for thirty years as one day. This is especially important for our young comrades. As everyone knows, our revolutionary path is still very long, and the Party and the revolutionary elders are hoping that we, these young and energetic youth comrades, can hold high the banner of socialism and communism and march towards the final victory. Therefore, we must always be loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and dedicate our lives to this magnificent cause.
    Secondly, we should learn from Comrade Bishi's high degree of principle that a revolutionary must possess. As everyone knows, Comrade Bishi had the greatest courage to fight against the enemy and against hostile ideas. Comrade Bishi was arrested twice by the enemy and never wavered, remaining firm and unyielding. In the struggle against opportunist tendencies within the Party, Comrade Bishi always stood firmly on the Party's position. Comrade Bishi was very strict with himself in all aspects, and very humble, concerned, and loving towards comrades and the masses. This is also especially important for our young comrades. As everyone knows, we are now in a transitional period with fierce class struggle. Therefore, we must understand the teachings of the Party, firmly stand on the revolutionary position, wage a merciless struggle against all enemies at home and abroad, draw a clear line between ourselves and those ideas and behaviors that are incompatible with socialism, and temper ourselves into a strong communist fighter in actual struggle.
    Furthermore, we should also learn from Comrade Bishi's spirit of tireless study. As everyone knows, the most important reason why Comrade Bishi was able to become an outstanding revolutionary was because of his long-term and assiduous study. Comrade Bishi never interrupted his reading of Marxist-Leninist theoretical works. Comrade Bishi often paid attention to going deep into the masses to conduct investigations, and even when he was critically ill, he was still studying the current situation. Comrade Bishi wrote a profound sentence to his children: "Children should study hard, if you don't learn now, it will be useless in the future." This is also especially important for our young comrades. As everyone knows, the cause we are now engaged in is an extremely great cause that has never been done by our predecessors. If we want to contribute to this glorious cause, we must not only have the greatest enthusiasm and courage, but also have real skills. Therefore, we must study hard, study with the most tenacious spirit, and learn the skills needed for the work assigned to us by the Party and the country.
    Let our generation of youth inherit all the great legacy of Comrade Bishi and all the revolutionary martyrs, and strive to realize the expectations of the Party and the country for us.

    继承革命先烈的伟大遗产
    ——在首都青年代表瞻仰任弼时同志纪念馆时的讲话
    胡耀邦
    二十七日是任弼时同志逝世的五周年。大家要求瞻仰任弼时同志纪念馆，想从弼时同志的生平中学习一些东西，这当然是一件很有意义的事情。
    大家知道，我国人民从反对外国帝国主义的侵略和国内反动势力的压迫到新民主主义革命的成功，走过了极其艰难困苦的道路。从鸦片战争到现在，已经一百一十五年。从中国共产党诞生到中华人民共和国的成立，整整有二十八年另三个月。在这些漫长的日子里，千千万万个革命先烈们，为着我们，也为着我们的万代子孙，贡献出了他们宝贵的生命。当着我们为祖国的今天而欢欣鼓舞的时候，当着我们为自己的前程而纵情歌唱的时候，我们并没有忘记这些革命先烈，时常怀念着他们，这当然是非常应该的，是绝对正确的。
    我们不仅要深深地感激他们，而且要全面地知道他们留给我们什么伟大的遗产。那末什么是革命先烈们留下的伟大遗产呢？我认为最主要的有下面三个方面。
    革命先烈们留给了我们伟大的革命功勋。这就是说，没有他们，没有他们和一切革命长辈们率领着我国广大人民英勇奋斗，我们的国家早已经变成了完全的殖民地，我国人民早就沦为受人压迫、剥削和侮辱的最悲惨的奴隶。
    革命先烈们留给了我们伟大的革命精神。这就是说，他们随时随地能够把祖国和人民大众的利益看作是最神圣的东西，能够使个人利益服从于革命事业的利益。人总是珍贵自己的生命的，但是当革命利益需要的时候，他们就可以毫不犹豫地贡献出自己的头颅和鲜血。
    革命先烈们留给了我们伟大的革命智慧。这就是说，他们善于从实际斗争中不断地去追求革命的真理，善于按照马克思列宁主义去寻找中国革命的具体规律。同志们都知道，正是由于革命先烈们的无数革命经验，经过我们的伟大领袖毛主席不断地集中和提高，就成了指导我国革命胜利的马克思列宁主义和中国革命具体实践相结合的科学。毫无疑义，这门科学对指导我们把我国建成伟大的社会主义和共产主义社会，是具有多么重大的意义。
    任弼时同志的名字对我们这一代青年是特别亲切的。任弼时同志是我国人民的一个杰出的儿子，是我们党的一位优秀的领导者，是毛主席的亲密战友，是中国青年的榜样和导师。因而我们今天特别来学习任弼时同志所留给我们的宝贵遗产是很重要的。
    首先，我们应当学习弼时同志那种全心全意、一贯到底为人民服务的英雄气概。大家知道，弼时同志从十六岁起一直到脉搏停止跳动，他把全部的心血献给了革命。弼时同志从来没有感觉到自己对革命有功而计较过什么地位，从来没有因工作有成绩而感到自满，从来没有因为革命有了进展而有丝毫的懈怠，真是三十年如一日。这一点，对我们青年同志特别重要。大家知道，我们革命的路途还很远，党和革命的长辈们正是希望我们这些年轻力壮的青年同志能够高举着社会主义和共产主义的旗帜走向最后的胜利。因此，我们一定要永远忠实于党，忠实于人民，立志把自己的一生献给这个壮丽的事业。
    其次，我们应当学习弼时同志那种革命者必须具有的高度的原则性。大家知道，弼时同志对敌人和对敌对思想有最大的斗争勇气。弼时同志两次被敌人逮捕都毫不动摇，坚贞不屈。弼时同志在党内反对机会主义倾向的斗争中，总是坚定地站在党的立场上。弼时同志对自己各方面都很严格，对同志、对群众都很谦逊，很关心，很爱护。这一点，对我们青年同志也特别重要。大家知道，我们现在正处在一个有激烈的阶级斗争的过渡时期。因此，我们一定要领会党的教导，牢牢地站稳革命的立场，同国内外一切敌人作无情的斗争，同那些和社会主义不相容的思想行为划清界限，在实际斗争中把自己锻炼成为一个坚强的共产主义战士。
    再其次，我们还应当学习弼时同志那种孜孜不倦的学习精神。大家知道，弼时同志之所以能够成为一位卓越的革命家，最重要的一点就是因为他长期刻苦地用功学习。弼时同志从来没有间断过阅读马克思列宁主义的理论著作。弼时同志经常注意深入群众作调查，就是病危的时候，也还在研究时局。弼时同志写给他孩子的一句意义深长的话说：“小孩子要用心读书，现在不学，将来没用。”这一点，对我们青年同志也特别重要。大家知道，我们现在所从事的事业是前人从来没有做过的极其伟大的事业。我们要对这一个光辉的事业有所贡献，不但要有最大的热情和勇气，而且要有实实在在的本领。因此，我们一定要努力学习，用最顽强的精神去学习，学到党和国家交给我们的工作所需要的本领。
    让我们这一代青年把弼时同志和一切革命先烈们的伟大遗产全部继承下来，努力实现党和国家对我们的期待。
