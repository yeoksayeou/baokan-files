Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, October 23rd. More than 300,000 backbone cadres for establishing cooperatives have grown up in the rural areas of Anhui Province. This group of backbone cadres has been cultivated by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Anhui Provincial Committees at all levels in the agricultural cooperation movement over the past four years. This group of backbones are mainly outstanding rural workers and the leaders and activists of more than 47,000 old cooperatives, many of whom are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. They have now become a huge driving force in the agricultural cooperation movement. For example, in many old cooperatives in Shucheng County, there are 1,494 backbone cadres who know how to run cooperatives. More than 90 percent of the agricultural producers' cooperatives in Huoshan County can spare backbone cadres to help the surrounding masses establish cooperatives. Zhang Huiting, an agricultural labor model of Anhui Province and the director of Xinmin Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Yingshang County, and his wife and daughter have all become experts in running cooperatives.

The CPC Anhui Provincial Committees at all levels have paid more attention to the training of backbone cadres for establishing cooperatives. In the agricultural cooperation movement over the past four years, batches of cadres and rural activists for establishing cooperatives have been trained and cultivated every year. From last year to now, about 200,000 backbone cadres have been trained. The county committees of the CPC at all counties have assigned county committee members to specifically lead training classes. In addition to studying various policies on agricultural cooperation, the content of the training includes the introduction of experience by old cooperatives, and education is conducted using practical examples. In addition, the method of "taking apprentices" has also been adopted in various places, with old cooperatives teaching those who are to establish cooperatives how to do so. When agricultural producers' cooperatives in Anhui Province developed greatly last winter and this spring, the CPC Anhui Provincial Committee especially emphasized mass participation in establishing cooperatives and leadership by Party branches. Therefore, a large number of rural cadres and activists learned the skills of establishing cooperatives and accumulated experience in establishing cooperatives in the actual struggle.

These backbone cadres, who have grown up in actual struggle, are trusted by the peasants because they have set an excellent example for the peasants themselves. After this year's autumn harvest, many peasants took the initiative to ask them to help establish cooperatives. In Shou County, the backbone of more than 260 agricultural producers' cooperatives in just five districts helped peasants establish more than 190 new cooperatives. Chen Youxiang, the director of the Yaoma Township Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Dingyuan County, not only helped mutual aid teams establish seven new cooperatives, but also helped them formulate production plans and promoted production. The CPC Anhui Provincial Committees at all levels cherish this emerging force very much, and are now training them in batches in a planned way and using them boldly.

### 安徽省培养出三十多万名办社骨干

    安徽省培养出三十多万名办社骨干
    新华社合肥二十三日电　三十多万办社骨干已在安徽省农村中成长起来。这批办社骨干是中共安徽省各级党委在四年来的农业合作化运动中培养起来的。这批骨干主要是优秀的乡村工作人员和四万七千多个老社的领导人和积极分子，很多是共产党员和青年团员，他们现在已成为农业合作化运动中的一支巨大的推动力量。如舒城县许多老社中，会办社的骨干就有一千四百九十四人。霍山县百分之九十以上的农业生产合作社，都能抽出骨干来为周围群众办社。安徽省农业劳动模范、颍上县新民农业生产合作社社长张会亭和他的妻子、女儿，都已成了办社的能手。
    中共安徽省各级党委都比较重视办社骨干的培养工作。在四年来的农业合作化运动中逐年都训练和培养了成批的办社干部和农村积极分子。从去年到现在，受到训练的办社骨干分子就有二十万人左右。中共各县县委抽出了县委委员专门领导训练班，训练的内容除学习农业合作化的各种政策外，还由老社介绍经验，用实际事例进行教育。另外，各地还采取了“带徒弟”的办法，由老社教会建社对象去办社。去冬今春安徽省农业生产合作社大发展时，中共安徽省委员会特别强调了群众办社，支部领导，因此大批农村干部和积极分子都在实际斗争中学会了办社的本领，积累了办社的经验。
    这些从实际斗争中成长起来的办社骨干，由于他们自己已为农民树立了优秀的榜样，很得农民信任。在今年秋收后，很多农民主动请他们去帮助办社。寿县仅五个区就有二百六十多个农业生产合作社的骨干帮助农民建了一百九十多个新社。定远县姚马乡农业生产合作社社长陈有香不仅帮助互助组建立了七个新社，还帮助他们订生产计划，推动了生产。中共安徽省各级党委十分珍视这支新生力量，现正有计划地分批加以训练，大胆使用。
