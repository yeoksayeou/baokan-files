The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which occupies one-sixth of China's land area, is a beautiful and rich place. Living here are 13 ethnic groups, including Uygur, Kazakh, Han, Hui, Kirgiz, Mongolian, Russian, Uzbek, Sibe, Tajik, Tatar, Daur, and Manchu, totaling more than 4.87 million people. The Uygur people are the most numerous, accounting for more than 74 percent.

The autonomous region is located in the heart of the Asian continent. The climate is dry, with an average annual rainfall of less than 200 millimeters, and in some places, it does not rain all year round. For thousands of years, farmers of all ethnic groups have utilized the snowmelt from the Altay, Tianshan, and Kunlun mountain ranges to dig canals and wells, diverting water to irrigate the land. They have reclaimed oases in the vast Gobi desert, establishing beautiful villages and cities. In the famous "Flaming Mountain" Turpan Basin, the average annual rainfall is less than 30 millimeters. More than a thousand years ago, farmers of all ethnic groups dug thousands of underground channels called "karez" to bring water to fertile farmland and vineyards. This was a huge project, comparable to the ancient Great Wall and the Grand Canal. After liberation, the People's Government paid more attention to water conservancy construction, leading farmers of all ethnic groups to build water conservancy projects. With the help of the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, they dug thousands of new canals of various sizes. The irrigated area increased by more than 4.87 million mu compared to 1949. In 1954, the total output of various major crops increased by 65.44 percent compared to 1949. This enabled the border region, which originally lacked grain and cotton, to meet local needs.

The Junggar Basin, Tarim Basin, and Turpan Basin are the most suitable areas for cotton planting in China. The fertile land suitable for cotton planting stretches for more than 2,000 kilometers, and the cotton field area is expanding year by year. This year, the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army planted more than 80,000 mu of cotton fields in the Manas River basin on the edge of the Junggar Basin, with an average yield of more than 400 jin of seed cotton per mu, setting a national record for high yield in large-scale cotton fields. Xinjiang's cotton production is not only higher than in general areas, but also of good quality. In 1954, it began to be shipped to Shanghai to support the industrial construction of the interior.

The Hotan and Shache regions at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains have a mild climate and mulberry trees grow into forests. In the sixth and seventh centuries AD, the local silk industry was very developed. The famous ancient Silk Road passed through this area to Western countries. Before liberation, the silk industry here was severely damaged. In 1949, the annual cocoon production was only more than 60 tons. In recent years, the People's Government has airlifted tens of thousands of boxes of high-quality silkworm eggs from Zhejiang and Jiangsu, and sent dozens of silkworm breeding technical cadres from these regions to help local Uygur silkworm farmers improve silkworm breeds. The silk industry in southern Xinjiang has been developed again, and this year, the Uygur silkworm farmers produced more than 10,000 metric tons of fresh cocoons.

The Kazakh, Mongolian, Kirgiz, and Tajik people are engaged in animal husbandry production in the autonomous region. They graze more than 10 million head of livestock on the grasslands of the Altay Mountains, Tianshan Mountains, Kunlun Mountains foothills, and the Pamir Plateau. After liberation, the People's Government did a lot of work to support the development of animal husbandry production by all ethnic groups. In 1954, the total number of livestock in the region increased by 42 percent compared to 1949. Thousands of poor herdsmen who originally had no livestock now have livestock. At present, more than 1,800 mutual aid teams for animal husbandry have been established in the vast pastoral areas, three animal husbandry production cooperatives have been piloted, and 95 state-owned ranches and breeding farms have been established. Under the guidance of Soviet animal husbandry expert Troyitsky, the Gongnais Fine-Wool Sheep Farm in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture has successfully cultivated the only fine-wool sheep breed in the country—the Xinjiang sheep. According to the appraisal of Soviet and Chinese animal husbandry experts, the Xinjiang ram produces 8 kilograms of wool per year, and the ewe produces 6 kilograms. The fineness of the wool can spin 60 to 64 count yarn. In 1954, the wool fabrics woven by the Chongqing Wool Textile Factory with Xinjiang wool were even better than those woven with the world-famous Australian fine wool. Xinjiang sheep have been promoted throughout Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, and Northeast China. Xinjiang wool will be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities this year.

The autonomous region has long been regarded as a mineral-rich area in China, but for many years, these underground treasures have not been exploited. Now, dozens of modern factories and mines have appeared on this wasteland, including non-ferrous metals, petroleum, electricity, coal mines, iron and steel, machinery manufacturing, automobile repair, cement, cotton spinning, silk reeling, printing and dyeing, and flour. The output value of modern industry now accounts for 11 percent of the region's national economy.

According to preliminary surveys in recent years, Xinjiang has abundant reserves of non-ferrous metals, iron, copper, coal, petroleum, oil shale, barite, manganese, and various chemical industrial raw materials. Large-scale exploration work has begun this year. In addition to using the latest instruments for land exploration, aircraft are also used for aerial detection. The Liudaowan Coal Mine, which is currently being mined, has a coal series extending for more than 100 li, with more than 30 layers of minable coal, and the thickest coal seam is more than 40 meters, making it one of the largest coalfields in China.

The 13 ethnic groups living in the autonomous region have had a high level of culture since ancient times, and have made many contributions to the founding of the great motherland. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people of all ethnic groups began a new era, permanently getting rid of their oppressed status and living a free and happy life. With the continuous improvement of economic life, the cultural and educational undertakings of the autonomous region have developed considerably. At present, there are more than 398,000 students in universities, middle schools, and primary schools in the region, an increase of more than 188,000 compared to 1949. The autonomous region has never had a higher education institution. Today, there are Xinjiang College, August 1st Agricultural College, Russian Language College, and the Xinjiang Medical College, which is under construction. Since 1953, various ethnic minorities in the territory have successively implemented regional autonomy, and five autonomous prefectures and six autonomous counties have now been established.

The establishment of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region today marks a new stage in the construction of Xinjiang's various undertakings. People of all ethnic groups are working with full confidence, and they will build the autonomous region to be even more glorious and splendid. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新疆维吾尔自治区介绍
    占中国土地面积六分之一的新疆维吾尔自治区，是一个美丽而又富饶的地方。生活在这里的有维吾尔、哈萨克、汉、回、柯尔克孜、蒙古、俄罗斯、乌孜别克、锡伯、塔吉克、塔塔尔、达呼尔、满等十三个民族，共四百八十七万多人，其中维吾尔族人数最多，占百分之七十四以上。
    自治区处在亚洲大陆的腹地，气候干燥，年平均降雨量不到二百公厘，有些地方甚至终年不下雨。千百年来，各族农民就在这片干旱的土地上，利用阿尔泰山、天山、昆仑山三大山系的山巅融雪，开渠凿井，引水灌田，在浩瀚的戈壁荒野上，开拓了片片绿洲，建立起美丽的乡村和城市。在著名的“火洲”吐鲁番盆地，年平均降雨量不到三十公厘，一千多年以前，各族农民就从地下开凿了成千条地下渠道——坎儿井，把水引入肥沃的农田和葡萄园，工程巨大，堪与古代的长城、运河媲美。解放后，人民政府更加重视水利建设，领导各族农民兴修水利，在中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队帮助下，开凿了成千条新的大小渠道，灌溉面积比一九四九年增加了四百八十七万多亩，一九五四年各种主要作物总产量已比一九四九年增加了百分之六十五点四四。使得原来粮、棉缺乏的边疆，现在都已能满足本地的需要。
    准噶尔盆地、塔里木盆地、吐鲁番盆地是中国最适宜植棉的地区，能够种植棉花的沃土绵延两千多公里，棉田面积正在逐年扩大。中国人民解放军新疆军区生产建设部队今年在准噶尔盆地边缘玛纳斯河流域种植的八万多亩棉田，平均每亩收籽花四百斤以上，首创全国大面积棉田丰产的最高纪录。新疆的棉花产量不仅比一般地区高，而且质量很好，一九五四年已开始运往上海，支援内地的工业建设。
    昆仑山下的和阗、莎车专区，气候温和，桑树成林，公元六、七世纪，当地的蚕丝业就很发达，古代中国有名的丝道就是经过这个地区通往西方各国去的。解放前，这里的蚕丝业遭到严重破坏，一九四九年蚕茧年产量只有六十多吨。几年以来，人民政府从浙江、江苏空运几万盒优良蚕种，并从这些地区派去几十名蚕桑技术干部，扶助当地维吾尔族蚕农改良蚕种，南疆地区的蚕丝业又已发展起来，今年维吾尔族蚕农生产的鲜茧就有一万多公担。
    自治区从事畜牧业生产的有哈萨克、蒙古、柯尔克孜和塔吉克等族人民，他们在阿尔泰山、天山、昆仑山山麓以及帕米尔高原的草原上，放牧着一千多万头牲畜。解放后，人民政府为扶助各族牧民发展畜牧业生产，作了很多工作。一九五四年全区牲畜总数已比一九四九年增加了百分之四十二，成千上万原来没有牲畜的穷苦牧民，今天都有了牲畜。现在，广大牧区已建立了一千八百多个牧业互助组、试办了三个畜牧业生产合作社，建立了九十五个国营牧场、种畜场。伊犁哈萨克族自治州巩乃斯种羊场，在苏联畜牧专家特罗依茨基指导下，培育成功了全国唯一的细毛种羊——新疆羊。经苏联和中国的畜牧专家鉴定，新疆羊公羊年产毛八公斤，母羊产六公斤，毛的细度能纺六十至六十四支纱。一九五四年经重庆毛纺织厂用新疆羊毛织成的毛织品，比用世界著名的澳大利亚细羊毛织的还好。新疆羊已在新疆全境和青海、甘肃、东北等地推广。新疆羊毛今年就将大量运往上海。
    自治区很早就被认为是中国一个矿藏丰富的地区，但许多年来，这些地下宝藏都没有开采。现在，这片荒地上已出现了有色金属、石油、电力、煤矿、钢铁、机器制造、汽车修配、水泥、棉纺、缫丝、印染和面粉等现代化厂矿几十个，现代工业产值已占全区国民经济的百分之十一。
    根据几年来的初步调查，新疆地下埋藏的有色金属、铁、铜、煤、石油、油母页岩、重晶石、锰以及各种化学工业原料等都很丰富。今年已开始了较大规模的勘探工作，除使用最新式的仪器进行陆地勘探外，还用飞机在空中进行探测。正在开采的六道湾煤矿，煤系伸延的长度有百多里，可采煤有三十多层，最厚的煤层有四十多公尺，是中国最大的煤田之一。
    生活在自治区境内的十三个民族，自古以来都有较高的文化，对于伟大祖国的缔造，都有过不少的贡献。中华人民共和国成立后，各族人民开始了一个新的纪元，他们永远地摆脱了被压迫的地位，过着自由幸福的生活。随着经济生活的不断上升，自治区的文教事业已有相当发展。现在，全区有大学、中学和小学学生三十九万八千多人，比一九四九年增加了十八万八千多人。自治区从来没有一所高等学校，今天已有新疆学院、八一农学院、俄文专科学校以及正在修建中的新疆医学院。从一九五三年起，境内各少数民族陆续实行区域自治，现已建立了五个自治州和六个自治县。
    新疆维吾尔自治区今天成立了，它标志着新疆各项建设事业又进入一个新的阶段，各族人民正满怀信心地进行工作，他们要把自治区建设得更加光辉灿烂。　（新华社）
