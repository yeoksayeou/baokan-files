The "Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Townships" have achieved significant results after being implemented in several towns and townships for a month or two. Phenomena such as duplicate supplies, speculative purchases, grain outflow, and waste have been further reduced. According to statistics from 238 cities, grain sales in September decreased by 250 million jin compared to the same period last year. According to comprehensive statistics from six large and medium-sized cities, including Shanghai, Jinan, Xi'an, Nanjing, Fuzhou, and Baoding, grain sales can be reduced by about 10 percent compared to the previous year after the implementation of rationing. If the national grain sales in towns and townships decrease by an average of about 7 percent compared to last year, 2 to 3 billion jin of grain can be saved annually. According to the situation in various towns and townships that have already implemented this method, this figure is possible and should be achieved.

The amount of grain supplied to town and township residents as stipulated by the state has been proven by facts to fully meet actual needs; the reasonable grain needs of town and township residents continue to be reliably guaranteed. According to a typical survey in Shanghai, according to the assessed supply grades and rationing standards, residents who have enough to eat accounted for 88 to 91 percent of the total households surveyed, residents with surplus grain accounted for 6 to 8 percent, and residents with insufficient grain accounted for only 3 to 4 percent, and most of them only lacked one to three jin of grain per month, which can be adequately met through appropriate adjustments. The situation of rationing in other towns and townships is roughly the same as in Shanghai. Some cities, such as Guangzhou, can set various supply standards lower than the state-stipulated amounts based on the actual needs of residents. The vast majority of town and township residents have further recognized the consistency of national and individual interests from the effects of grain rationing, and have recognized the importance of obeying the state plan for building socialism. Therefore, they have enthusiastically supported this measure. The broad masses of farmers are also satisfied to see that the phenomenon of wasting grain in cities has been effectively stopped. A farmer in Hunan Province, seeing the achievements of grain rationing in Changsha City, said with satisfaction: "In the past, people in the countryside were thrifty, while people in the cities were wasteful; now, both urban and rural areas are thrifty, which is reasonable! Our enthusiasm for increasing grain production is even greater." The implementation of the grain rationing measures in towns and townships has obviously played an important role in strengthening urban-rural relations and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

However, some towns and townships did not do enough publicity and education work and preparation work for grain rationing, and the grading of rationing was not appropriate enough; some towns and townships also managed the grain consumption of the grain industry too tightly, so that the supply of cooked food, grain replicas, and non-staple food once became tight. These shortcomings must be corrected. All towns and townships that are preparing to implement grain rationing should learn from these experiences and lessons and avoid similar shortcomings from recurring.

Correctly dividing supply grades and appropriately determining rationing standards are the keys to the smooth implementation of grain rationing measures. Experience has shown that if the supply grades and rationing standards can be divided and assessed more meticulously, then the number of people with surplus and insufficient grain among residents will decrease, and the effect of rationing will be greater. Some town and township residents regard grain rationing grades as a kind of political treatment. Regardless of their actual needs, they insist on being classified into supply grades with higher rationing standards. Some residents have no idea how much grain they use, or they demand to buy more grain, or they blindly buy grain replicas and cooked food, or even blindly buy more potatoes and melons as food. Although these people account for only a very small number of town and township residents, and although this is only a temporary phenomenon that occurred at the very beginning of the rationing work, it is necessary to conduct patient and in-depth persuasion and education on them based on their specific ideological conditions, so that they can adopt a correct attitude towards this significant measure. If the ideological problems of a small number of people cannot be resolved in a timely manner, it will also affect other people and even create a certain degree of tension. This is something that must be paid special attention to in the grain work of towns and townships.

To make the supply grades of various types of residents reasonable, it is necessary to conduct detailed investigations into the occupations and labor conditions of residents on the basis of in-depth publicity and education, and to clarify the grain consumption of various types of residents. Only by carrying out such work can the division of supply grades and the determination of rationing standards be both in accordance with the provisions of the measures and appropriately meet the needs of various categories of town and township residents. For people whose supply grades are not easy to divide, such as unemployed workers, students out of school, temporary workers, demobilized soldiers, independent laborers, etc., supply grades and rationing standards should be stipulated realistically according to their labor conditions and age; it should never be thought that this is a problem for a small number of people and not pay attention to solving it. It should be seen that in towns and townships, especially in larger cities, the occupations and types of work of residents are very complex. Even for the same type of work, there are differences in the degree of labor. Therefore, to make the supply grade of each consumer very appropriate, it is impossible to rely solely on the personnel of the grain organs or work teams. They should be combined with various organs, organizations, enterprises, and residents' organizations, and take the form of division by industry, category, and system to divide residents' supply grades under leadership. The supply grades of organized personnel should be assessed first, and then the supply grades of ordinary residents should be assessed. Among street residents, the supply grades of activists should be assessed first, and then the supply grades of the general public should be assessed. Everyone must be able to fully express their opinions on their supply grade, and the staff of grain organs and work teams should carefully listen to and consider these opinions, so as to check whether the division of supply grades is reasonable and effectively improve the grain rationing work. A small amount of grain adjustment among a very small number of residents is still permissible and necessary. Various towns and townships can take appropriate measures to solve this in organs, organizations, enterprises, and residents' organizations according to their specific local conditions.

After the implementation of grain rationing in towns and townships, the publicity and education of saving grain is still very important. Some town and township residents believe that since grain supply in towns and townships has been rationed per person, it is no longer necessary to save grain. This idea is wrong. These people should be made to understand that the purpose of the state's implementation of grain rationing measures in towns and townships is to more rationally allocate grain consumption and eliminate grain waste. Therefore, under no circumstances should the behavior of wasting grain be continuously opposed.

In terms of grain consumption in town and township industries, we should appropriately meet the needs of town and township residents in all aspects under the principle of rational supply and grain saving. When various towns and townships implement the method of supplying grain products with tickets, appropriate steps must be stipulated: first implement it in the main varieties, then implement it in the secondary varieties; first implement it in replicas, then implement it in cooked food. The scope of implementation should also be gradually increased. All localities must ensure the stability of the entire market, gradually strengthen the source preparation and market management of non-staple food, and properly arrange for various industries related to grain.

The grain rationing measures in towns and townships are continuing to be promoted and implemented. All towns and townships that are about to implement this method must establish special organizations under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, do in-depth investigation and research and other preparatory work, and on this basis, widely and deeply carry out publicity and education, so that the grain rationing measures are combined with political mobilization. This is the decisive condition for doing a good job in grain rationing.

### 市镇粮食定量供应工作要认真做好

    市镇粮食定量供应工作要认真做好
    “市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”在若干市镇实行了一两个月，就获得了显著的成绩。供应重复、投机套购和粮食外流、浪费等现象，已经进一步地减少了。据二百三十八个城市的统计，九月份粮食销售量比去年同期减少了二亿五千万斤。据上海、济南、西安、南京、福州、保定等六个大中城市综合统计，实行定量供应以后，粮食销售量就能比上年度减少百分之十左右。如果全国市镇的粮食销售量比去年平均减少百分之七左右，全年即可节约二、三十亿斤粮食。按照已经实行这个办法的各城镇的情况看来，这个数字是可能和应该达到的。
    国家规定的市镇居民粮食供应数量，已被事实证明完全符合实际的需要；市镇居民合理的粮食需要继续得到可靠的保证。据上海市典型调查，按照评定的供应等级和定量供应标准，粮食够吃够用的居民占调查总户数的百分之八十八至九十一，粮食有剩余的居民占百分之六至八，粮食不足的居民只占百分之三至四，而且他们大都每月只缺一斤到三斤粮食，经过适当的调剂，也能够吃够用。其他市镇实行定量供应的情况，和上海大体相同。有些城市如广州按居民实际需要，各类供应标准还可以低于国家规定的数量。广大市镇居民已经从粮食定量供应的效果上进一步认识了国家利益和个人利益的一致性，认识了服从国家计划对于建设社会主义的重要性，因而，都热烈拥护和支持这个措施。广大农民看到城市浪费粮食的现象已被有效制止，也都表示满意。湖南省一个农民看到长沙市粮食定量供应的成绩，满意地说：“过去乡里人节约，城里人浪费；现在城乡都节约，这才合理哩！我们增产粮食的劲头更大了。”市镇粮食定量供应办法的实施，对于加强城乡关系，巩固工农联盟显然起了重要的作用。
    但是，有些市镇对于粮食定量供应的宣传教育工作和准备工作做得不充分，定量供应的等级划分得不够妥善；也有些市镇对粮食行业的用粮管理过紧，以致熟食品、粮食复制品和副食品一度发生供应紧张的现象。这些缺点都必须加以纠正。所有正在准备实行粮食定量供应的市镇，更应该接受这些经验教训，避免类似的缺点重复发生。
    正确地划分供应等别，适当地确定定量标准，是顺利实行粮食定量供应办法的关键。经验证明，供应等别和定量标准如果能够比较细致地加以划分和评定，那么，居民中粮食多余和不足的人都会减少，定量供应的效果就更大。有些市镇居民把粮食定量供应等级看做一种政治待遇，他们不问实际需要如何，一味要求把自己划入定量标准较高的供应等级。有些居民对自己用粮多少，心中无数，或者要求多买粮食，或者盲目地购买粮食复制品和熟食品，甚至盲目多购薯类和瓜类作食品。这些人虽然只占市镇居民的极少数，虽然只是在定量供应工作刚刚开始的时候发生的暂时现象，但是必须根据他们具体的思想状况，对他们进行耐心的深入的说服教育，使他们能够采取正确的态度对待这个意义重大的措施。少数人的思想问题如果不能及时解决，也会影响其他的人，甚至造成某种程度的紧张现象，这在市镇粮食工作中是要特别加以注意的。
    要把各类居民的供应等别划分得合情合理，就必须在深入的宣传教育的基础上，对居民的职业和劳动情况进行细密的调查，把各种居民的粮食消费情况都弄清楚。只有进行了这样的工作，才能使供应等别的划分和定量标准的确定，既符合办法的规定，又恰当地满足了各种类别的市镇居民的需要。对于供应等别不容易划分的人，如失业工人、失学学生、临时工人、转业军人、独立劳动者等等，应该按照劳动状况和年龄的不同，实事求是地规定供应等别和定量标准；决不应该以为这是少数人的问题，就不注意加以解决。应该看到，在市镇中，特别是在较大的城市中，居民的职业和工种非常复杂，即使同一工种，也有劳动程度不同的差别。因此，要把每一个消费者的供应等别都划分得十分恰当，光靠粮食机关或工作组的人员是不可能的。他们应该同各机关、团体、企业以及居民组织结合起来，采取分业、分类、分系统的方式，有领导地划分居民的供应等别。要先评定有组织人员的供应等别，后评定一般居民的供应等别。在街道居民中，要先评定积极分子的供应等别，后评定一般群众的供应等别。必须使每一个人都能对自己的供应等别充分发表意见，粮食机关和工作组的工作人员，应该认真地倾听和考虑这些意见，借以检查供应等别的划分是否合理，切实改进粮食定量供应工作。在极少数居民中间的小量粮食调剂仍然可以允许，也是必要的，各个市镇可以根据当地的具体情况，在机关、团体、企业单位和居民组织中采取适当的方式加以解决。
    在实行市镇粮食定量供应以后，节约粮食的宣传教育仍然是十分重要的。有些市镇居民认为市镇粮食供应已经按人定量，就可以不必节约粮食了。这种想法是不对的。应该使这些人懂得，国家所以实行市镇粮食定量供应办法，目的就是要更合理地分配粮食消费，消除粮食浪费现象。因此，不管在任何情况底下，浪费粮食的行为都是必须继续反对的。
    在市镇行业用粮方面，我们应该在合理供应和节约粮食的原则下，适当满足市镇居民各方面的需要。各市镇在实行粮食制成品凭票供应办法的时候，必须规定适当的步骤：先在主要品种方面实行，后在次要品种方面实行；先在复制品方面实行，后在熟食品方面实行。实行的范围也应该逐步地增大。各地必须保证整个市场的稳定，逐步加强副食品的货源准备和市场管理，对于同粮食有关的各个行业必须加以妥善的安排。
    市镇粮食定量供应办法正在继续推广实行。凡是即将实行这个办法的市镇，必须在党委统一领导下，建立专门组织，做好深入的调查研究和其他准备工作，并且在这个基础上广泛深入地展开宣传教育，使粮食定量供应办法和政治动员结合起来，这是做好粮食定量供应工作的决定条件。
