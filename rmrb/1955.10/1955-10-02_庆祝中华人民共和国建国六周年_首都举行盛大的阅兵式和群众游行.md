Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: On October 1st, all circles in the capital held a grand military parade and mass procession at Tiananmen Square to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    On this national holiday, Tiananmen Square looked particularly solemn. The national emblem of the People's Republic of China and a giant portrait of the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, were hung on Tiananmen. On the tall red buildings at both ends of the red wall, slogans commemorating National Day were written: "Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the Whole Country!" "Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World!" "Long Live Marxism-Leninism!" "Long Live World Peace!" The various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, wearing newly styled uniforms and bearing rank insignia on their shoulders and collars, were solemnly arrayed under countless fluttering red flags to receive the review.

    Chairman Mao Zedong, along with Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai, arrived at the reviewing stand on Tiananmen before the parade. At this moment, the crowd erupted in a storm of thunderous applause, cheering the leaders of the Party and the state.

    Also on the reviewing stand were: Vice Chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Soong Ching Ling, Deputy Premiers of the State Council Chen Yun and others, the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, heads of the various ministries and commissions of the People's Republic of China, Vice Presidents of the Supreme People's Court, Deputy Procurators-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Standing Committee members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    At ten o'clock, the Mayor of Beijing, Peng Zhen, announced the opening of the National Day celebration rally of the people of the capital. The military band played the national anthem, and the salute was fired.

    The military parade began. Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, set off from Tiananmen in a reviewing car, accompanied by General Yang Chengwu, the commander-in-chief of the parade, to review the various units of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and to extend festive congratulations to them: "Long Live the People's Republic of China!" "Long Live the Communist Party of China!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" At this time, all officers and soldiers responded loudly: "Long Live! Long Live! Long Live!" This sound was filled with love for their motherland and Party, and for their great leader.

    After inspecting the troops, Marshal Peng Dehuai ascended the reviewing stand and issued an order to all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (the full text of the order will be issued separately).

    At 10:25 AM, the march-past began. General Yang Chengwu drove past from the east side of the square in a command car. Behind the command car was the contingent of the Military Academy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. To the tune of a "March," they marched in neat steps into Tiananmen Square. They are officers who, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have undergone long and arduous struggles and revolutionary war training, and have rich experience in armed struggle. Now they are striving for perfection, studying Marxist-Leninist theory and modern military science.

    Next, the contingents of the Infantry School, Artillery School, Engineering School, Tank School, Aviation School, and Naval School passed through Tiananmen Square. They are all outstanding youths of the motherland. Their vigorous strides demonstrated their strong revolutionary will and their spirit of advancing bravely.

    The sailors who defend the territorial waters of the motherland passed through the square, and then the Public Security Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who are a hundred times more vigilant in defending the socialist construction, continued to march forward.

    Well-equipped infantry, motorized infantry, and paratrooper units passed in succession before the reviewing stand in strict formation.

    At this time, a torrent of steel appeared in front of Tiananmen, with various types of large-caliber, long-range artillery pieces towed by tractors, advancing in orderly rows. Finally, the tank units passed through the square.

    After the ground forces passed through the square, the divine eagles of the motherland, swift as the wind and lightning, appeared in the skies above the capital. Behind the lead plane, formations of jet bombers and fighters soared overhead.

    People constantly cheered and saluted these troops receiving the review, who demonstrated a high degree of organization and powerful combat effectiveness.

    Today, on the viewing stands in front of Tiananmen were: representatives of the National People's Congress in Beijing, senior cadres of the various organs of the Government, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, heads of the various directly affiliated departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, heads of the central democratic parties and people's organizations, members of the National Defense Council, generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers, industrial labor models, agricultural labor models, famous scientists, writers, artists, representatives of ethnic minorities and returned overseas Chinese, and heads of the various organs of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, the Beijing organizations of the CCP and the democratic parties, the people's organizations of Beijing, and the various universities and colleges in the capital.

    There were also: more than two thousand foreign guests from more than fifty countries who had been invited to our country to attend the celebrations and who were visiting Beijing.

    Also watching the ceremony were the heads of diplomatic missions and diplomatic officials from various countries in China.

    On the distinguished guests' viewing stand were: experts from the Soviet Union, the various people's democratic countries, and other countries who were helping our country with its construction like brothers.

    A total of more than 12,000 people participated in the viewing.

    Today's review left an indelible impression on people: the Chinese People's Liberation Army has taken another big step forward in its construction. Relying on this modern, regularized, and invincible people's army, the Chinese people will surely be able to accomplish the glorious tasks of liberating Taiwan, defending against imperialist aggression, and safeguarding the socialist construction of the motherland, and will play a major role in maintaining peace in the Far East and world peace.

    The military parade lasted for fifty minutes and was followed by the mass procession.

    Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: Today, in our country's capital, Beijing, 500,000 people participated in the National Day parade.

    Immediately following the military parade, the mass holiday procession began. An honor guard carrying the national emblem and the characters "Celebrating National Day" led the procession. The huge placards of "Supporting the Five-Year Plan," "Liberate Taiwan," and "Long Live World Peace," surrounded by flowers and colored flags, represented the firm will of the people of Beijing and the people of the whole country to struggle for socialism.

    The honor guard carried portraits of the people's beloved leader Mao Zedong and his close comrades-in-arms Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Chen Yun, a portrait of the great democratic revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, portraits of the great revolutionary teachers of the working people of the world Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and portraits of the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government Bulganin, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Pervukhin, Saburov, Khrushchev, Kirichenko, and Suslov, and portraits of the leaders of fraternal countries Kim Il-sung, Ho Chi Minh, Bierut, Zapotocky, Pieck, Gheorghiu-Dej, Rakosi, Chervenkov, Hoxha, and Tsedenbal.

    The cheers of "Long Live the Communist Party of China!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" resounded throughout Tiananmen Square. The people thanked the organizers and inspirers of the socialist construction of the great motherland.

    The parading people shouted "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship!" "Long Live the Socialist Camp of Peace and Democracy!" "Long Live World Peace!" "Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World!" "Long Live Marxism-Leninism!" The people of the capital extended warm greetings to the Soviet people who selflessly helped our country's construction, to the people of fraternal countries who have formed close friendships with the Chinese people, and to all peace-loving people in the world.

    The square was undulating with a sea of flowers. The Young Pioneers marched forward happily with the band. The participants in today's parade were all outstanding members selected by the city's Young Pioneers themselves. They carried a sign that said "Always Ready," expressing their determination to struggle for the realization of communism and the great cause of the motherland.

    Chairman Mao waved to the parading children. Groups of peace doves flew from the children's arms, and countless balloons rose into the high sky. They waved the bouquets in their hands and cheered in unison, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live the Communist Party!" "Long Live World Peace!"

    When the contingent of national youth socialist construction activists appeared, the audience welcomed these advanced sons and daughters loyal to the socialist cause of the motherland with warm applause. This contingent, which has set off a new high tide of the national youth fighting for the realization of socialism, shouted in front of Tiananmen: "Strive to increase production and practice strict economy, and strive to complete the Five-Year Plan!" expressing the determination of the youth of the whole country to advance towards socialism under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao.

    Ahead of the workers' contingent surging forward in eighty columns was a huge propaganda painting of "Supporting the First Five-Year Plan." Metallurgical workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, dressed in white canvas work clothes, and models of huge blast furnaces and coke ovens advanced together. More than one hundred labor models and advanced producers walked at the front of the contingent. They and the workers of the whole plant completed the national production plan for the first three quarters of this year ahead of schedule, and produced 17,000 tons of pig iron more for the country. On a large pig iron model, the metallurgical workers wrote their guarantee - to produce 34,500 tons more pig iron for the country this year. Workers at the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill launched a "Wear Red Flowers to See Chairman Mao" competition in September. Today, 700 workers exceeded the production task for September and wore red flowers to participate in the parade. Over the past year, they have accumulated more than 7.4 million yuan in funds for the country and saved more than 40,000 kilograms of raw cotton. Workers in various industries in the capital reported to the Party and the government with more than 100 charts and models that they had completed the national production tasks year by year since the country entered the Five-Year Plan. In 1954, the total output value of various industries in the city increased by 55.2% compared with 1952. The workers shouted the slogan "Strive to complete the 1955 national construction plan!" They guaranteed that in addition to completing the plan this year, they would also accumulate an additional 62 million yuan in wealth for the country.

    There were many eye-catching models of new industrial products in Beijing in the workers' contingent. After the start of the First Five-Year Plan, the workers in the capital successfully trial-produced hundreds of new products to meet the needs of national construction and the material and cultural life of the people. Workers from the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant carried models of vertical milling machines and surface milling machines. They have trial-produced five new products this year. Workers from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant excitedly carried forward the model of the Stalin No. 6 combine harvester, which they successfully trial-produced this year. This is the sixth product they have successfully trial-produced to support agricultural production. Before National Day, they successfully trial-produced a three-knife mower pulled by a tractor.

    Workers in the capital overcame various difficulties and strived to support the construction of key national projects. Charts and models from the Liulihe Cement Plant and the Fengtai Bridge Factory illustrated that these two factories have successively supplied tens of thousands of tons of multi-labeled cement and bridges for the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Lanxin Railway, and the Guanting Hydropower Station, among other projects. Workers from the Beijing Electric Motor Factory carried a model of electrical switchgear equipment. The products of this local state-owned factory for the past three years can meet the needs of the electrical equipment of more than 40 new factories.

    Many factories have also trained a large number of skilled workers for various places. In the parade contingent of workers from the No. 1 Automobile Accessories Factory, there were the second and third batches of young workers trained by the factory for the No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the Tractor Manufacturing Plant.

    The female worker contingent of the newly built state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill, which was put into production before National Day, was dressed particularly brightly. They completed the national plan every day. The workers' contingent also included employees of the newly built Central Bureau of Metrology Factory and the North China Metal Structure Factory, which will soon be put into production. These are all factories built by the construction workers of Beijing. Since 1953, they have built 13 new factories in Beijing and rebuilt and expanded more than 100 factories. This year, they are building more than 3 million square meters of factories, schools, dormitories, and hospitals. In the construction of the capital of the motherland, 224 youth commando teams have emerged. They also participated in the parade today.

    The peasant contingent was composed of 5,000 agricultural labor models, production experts, and activists. Farmers in the suburbs of the capital greeted the upsurge of cooperation with great enthusiasm. People saw from the chart of the "Beijing Suburban Agricultural Production Cooperative Development Plan" that the rural areas in the suburbs of Beijing could basically become cooperative this year. The number of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives already accounts for 46% of the total number of farmers, and the number of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives this winter and next spring will exceed 60%. In just the past few days, more than 8,000 poor and lower-middle peasant households in the suburbs have signed up to join cooperatives.

    The members of the suburban agricultural production cooperatives participating in the parade carried charts and models of crops, indicating this year's bumper harvest. It was written on them that this year's vegetable production can reach 880 million catties, an increase of 160 million catties compared with last year. The members of the Huayuanzha Township No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative seemed particularly happy in the parade contingent. This is their first autumn harvest since the establishment of the cooperative. The highest corn yield per mu reached 750 catties, breaking the highest unit area yield in the suburbs of Beijing.

    The contingent of party and state organ workers entered the square with cheers. Staff members of the State Planning Commission and the State Statistical Bureau held high charts of the various targets of the First Five-Year Plan and the overview of the implementation of the national plan, clearly indicating that the 600 million people had achieved another major victory in the third year of the First Five-Year Plan construction. The models of rolling mills, coke ovens, and iron-smelting furnaces in the contingent of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the models of the newly put-into-production Hegang New No. 1 Mine and the automated high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power plant in the contingent of the Ministry of Coal Industry and the Ministry of Electric Power, and the model of the huge 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine in the contingent of the First Ministry of Machine Building attracted the attention of the audience. People cheered for the victory of the priority development of heavy industry in the First Five-Year Plan. In the contingent of the Ministry of Water Resources, there was a general plan of governing and developing the Yellow River and a model of the Sanmenxia Reservoir. The viewers applauded enthusiastically to the transformers of the great nature of the motherland.

    The mighty parade demonstrated the iron will to realize the socialist industrialization of the motherland and defend peace. Everywhere in the contingents parading in the urban area were peace dove signs with wings and clusters of green olive leaves. They held up signs that said "Prohibit the Use of Atomic Weapons" and shouted the slogan "Long Live World Peace."

    When the parading masses passed the reviewing stand, they constantly waved to the distinguished guests from various countries and extended their greetings, cheering "Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World!" The distinguished guests also waved to the working people of Beijing who were carrying out peaceful construction.

    The charts of the handicraft production cooperative members' contingent showed that Beijing had achieved new achievements in the gradual socialist transformation of handicrafts. In 1955, compared with 1952, the number of handicraft production cooperatives (groups) in the city had increased to 580%, the number of members was 420%, and the total output value had soared to 821%. The Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative supplied many daily necessities for the people of the capital. Next, the parade contingent of the business community passed through the square. Of the total output value of private industry and commerce in the city, those included in various types of state capitalism accounted for 81%. Of the total sales of private commerce, those included in various types of state capitalism accounted for more than 40%.

    The college and middle school students of the capital entered the square waving bouquets. Four large red and gold gauze lanterns with the words "Celebrating National Day" made of balloons rose to the Tiananmen reviewing stand. In the contingent, there were more than 19,000 college freshmen who had just enrolled this year. They carried various charts and models, expressing their determination to make themselves fully developed talents. In the graduation designs made by the graduates of eight higher engineering schools this year, there are many excellent designs that are of great help to improving factory and mining production and business management. In the days of entering planned construction, Beijing's various universities and colleges have trained nearly 20,000 construction talents for the country. The chart of the five-year talent training development plan of Tsinghua University shows that the number of students in this school now has increased by about twice compared with the early days of liberation. The students of the Beijing Forestry Institute walked past Tiananmen surrounded by a large pattern of "creating forests and curing the Yellow River." The students of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics' model aircraft flew in the sky above the square.

    Middle school students also came to accept Chairman Mao's review with "three good" achievements. In this academic year, the students of various middle schools in Beijing have made great progress in learning knowledge and socialist consciousness. They participated extensively in sports activities.

    The "Jubilant Festival" music played by the 400-member national band attracted the whole audience. This is a new ensemble created by the musicians of the capital for National Day. The largest literary and art contingent in history, composed of 7,000 literary and art workers, entered Tiananmen Square with new achievements.

    Looking from Tiananmen, the entire venue was "a hundred flowers in bloom." On the stage decorated with floats, the actors played vivid scenes from the dramas they starred in, "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains," the opera "Liu Hulan," the Peking opera "The Peach Blossom of Human Face," the Ping opera "Qin Xianglian," the Yue opera "The Western Chamber," and the amateur art troupe's dance "Ten Sisters."

    Next, twelve pairs of "lions" rolled embroidered balls, and nine flying giant dragons performed in Tiananmen Square. This is a traditional Chinese folk celebration dance.

    Thousands of dancers performed the "National Unity Dance." This large-scale dance representing the artistic colors of various ethnic groups is composed of the internationally honored "Lotus Dance," "Fan Dance," "Ordos Dance," and many successful ethnic dances.

    Wearing uniforms of various colors, the athletes participating in the upcoming First National Workers' Sports Games marched at the forefront of the sports contingent composed of 15,000 athletes. Many of these outstanding workers' athletes from all over the country are also advanced figures in production.

    The sports activities of the capital's employees are more active than in previous years. In the sports contingent, there are more than 2,000 male and female athletes from eight factories in the capital. Under the call of Chairman Mao to "develop sports and enhance the people's physique," the employees of the capital have extensively launched various sports activities. The number of employees who regularly participate in broadcast exercises has reached more than 280,000; the number of sports teams and exercise groups and the number of athletes has increased more than threefold compared with last year.

    The gymnastics team composed of student athletes performed colorful silk exercises, rattan ring exercises, stick exercises, and dumbbell exercises. Responding to Chairman Mao's call to be "good in body, good in study, and good in work" and under the training of the "Preparation for Labor and Defense" sports system, the students have made great achievements. They are advancing with great enthusiasm on the basis of labor system training. They have launched various national defense sports activities, and today motorcycle athletes are driving motorcycles to participate in the parade of the sports contingent.

    The military parade and mass procession lasted for a total of three hours and fifty minutes. After the entire parade contingent passed through Tiananmen, the workers, Young Pioneers, and students standing in the southern part of the square waved bouquets and went to Jinshui Bridge to cheer and salute Chairman Mao. At this time, beautiful fireworks flew into the high sky, and many colorful celebration slogans floated up. In the boiling cheers, Chairman Mao walked to both sides of the Tiananmen reviewing stand and frequently waved to the distinguished guests watching the ceremony and to the cheering people.

    The feeling of glory and happiness of being with the Party and the leader made the people firmly believe that our goal will surely be achieved. People guaranteed to use creative labor to build our country into a great socialist republic.

    成八十路纵队汹涌前进的工人队伍前面，是一幅巨大的“拥护第一个五年计划”的宣传画。石景山钢铁厂穿着白色帆布工作服的冶金工人和巨大的高炉、炼焦炉的模型一齐前进。一百多名劳动模范和先进生产者走在队伍的前列。他们和全厂工人一道提前完成了今年三个季度的国家生产计划，为国家多生产了一万七千吨生铁，在一大块生铁模型上，冶金工人们写上了他们的保证——今年要为国家多生产三万四千五百吨生铁。国营北京第一棉纺织厂的工人九月份展开了“戴红花见毛主席”的竞赛，今天七百个工人超额完成了九月份生产任务，戴上了红花来参加游行。一年来他们为国家积累了七百四十多万元资金，节约原棉四万多公斤。首都各产业工人以一百多个图表和模型，向党和政府报告他们在国家进入五年计划后逐年超额完成了国家生产任务。一九五四年比一九五二年，全市各类工业的生产总值增加了百分之五十五点二。工人们高呼：“努力完成一九五五年国家建设计划！”的口号。他们保证在今年除完成计划外，并为国家多积累六千二百万元的财富。
    工人队伍里有许多引人注目的北京市工业新产品的模型。在第一个五年计划开始后，首都工人们为国家建设和人民物质文化生活的需要，试制成功几百种新产品。北京第一机床厂工人抬着立式铣床、平面铣床的模型。他们今年已试制了五种新产品。北京农业机械厂工人兴奋地带着他们今年试制成功的斯大林六号联合收割机的模型前进。这是他们为支援农业生产试制成功的第六种产品。国庆节前他们又试制成功用拖拉机牵引的三刀割草机。
    首都工人克服种种困难，努力支援全国重点工程的建设。琉璃河水泥厂和丰台桥梁工厂的图表、模型说明了这两个厂先后以数以万吨计的多标号水泥和桥梁供应武汉长江大桥、兰新铁路和官厅水力发电站等工程建设。北京市电机厂工人抬着电气开关设备的模型。这个地方国营工厂三年来的产品，可供四十多个新建工厂电气设备的需要。
    许多工厂并为各地培养了大批技术工人。第一汽车附件厂工人的游行队伍里，就有这个厂为第一汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂培养的第二、三批青年工人。
    国庆节前投入生产的新建国营北京第二棉纺织厂的女工队伍，打扮得特别鲜艳。她们每天都完成了国家计划。工人队伍中还有新建的中央度量衡工厂和即将投入生产的华北金属结构工厂的职工。这都是北京市建筑工人亲手建立起来的工厂。他们从一九五三年起，已在北京新建了十三个工厂，改建和扩建了一百多个工厂。今年，他们又在兴建三百多万平方公尺建筑面积的工厂、学校、宿舍和医院。在祖国的首都的建设中，出现了二百二十四个青年突击队。他们今天也参加了游行。
    农民队伍是由五千个农业劳动模范、生产能手和积极分子组成的。首都郊区农民以极大的热情迎接合作化的高潮，人们从“北京市郊区农业生产合作社发展规划”的图表上看到：京郊农村今年就可以基本合作化。现有参加农业生产合作社的农户，已占农户总数的百分之四十六，今冬明春参加农业生产合作社的农户将超过百分之六十。就在这几天，郊区有八千多户贫农和下中农，纷纷报名参加合作社。
    参加游行的郊区农业生产合作社的社员们抬着的图表和农作物模型，表明了今年的丰收，上面写着今年的蔬菜产量能达八亿八千万斤，比去年增加了一亿六千万斤。花园闸乡第一农业生产合作社的社员们，在游行队伍中显得特别高兴。这是他们建社以后的第一个秋收，玉米每亩产量最高达到七百五十斤，突破了京郊最高单位面积产量。

    手工业生产合作社社员队伍的图表，显示了北京在逐步进行手工业的社会主义改造中，又取得了新的成就。一九五五年比一九五二年，全市手工业生产合作社（组）已增加到百分之五百八十，社员人数是百分之四百二十，生产总值激增到百分之八百二十一。北京市手工业生产合作社供应了首都人民许多生活日用品。接着，工商界的游行队伍通过了广场。全市私营业总产值中，纳入各类型国家资本主义的已占百分之八十一。私营商业总销货额中，纳入各类型国家资本主义占百分之四十以上。

    中等学校的学生也带着“三好”的成绩来接受毛主席的检阅。在这一学年中，北京市各中等学校的学生们在学习知识和社会主义觉悟等方面都有很大提高。他们广泛地参加了体育运动。
    四百人的民族乐队演奏的“欢腾的节日”乐曲，吸引着全场。这是首都音乐家为国庆节新创作的合奏曲。由七千名文艺工作者组成的历年来最大的文艺队伍，带着新的成就，进入天安门广场。
    从天安门上看去，全场“百花齐放”。在彩车装成的舞台上，由各演员们扮演着他们主演的话剧“万水千山”、歌剧“刘胡兰”、京剧“人面桃花”、评剧“秦香莲”、越剧“西厢记”和业余文艺团体的舞蹈“十大姐”等生动场面。
