In the grasslands along both banks of the Kaidu River and around Bosten Lake in Xinjiang, three mobile sheep dip pools have appeared this autumn. These are being piloted by the People's Committee of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. Each pool can dip 800 to 900 sheep a day. This year, these three pools will move around the nearby pastoral areas, providing free sheep dipping services to 12,000 sheep for herders of all ethnic groups.

Because the summer and winter pastures in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture are far apart, and the sheep flocks transfer early, the summer and autumn wool shearing cannot be done in the same pasture. Therefore, it is difficult for sheep to be dipped after shearing. In addition, the pastures in this area are relatively humid, and sheep are prone to parasitic diseases, which affects the harvest of wool. With mobile sheep dip pools, it will be possible to ensure that sheep are dipped in a timely manner, ensuring their healthy growth and abundant wool production.

    新疆建立三座流动绵羊药浴池
    在新疆开都河两岸及博斯腾湖周围的草原上，今年秋季开始出现了三座流动式的绵羊药浴池。这是巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州人民委员会试办的。每个池一天可药浴八百到九百只羊。今年内这三个池将流动在附近各个牧区，免费为各族牧民药浴一万二千只绵羊。
    巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州因夏牧场、冬牧场相距很远，羊群转移早，剪收夏秋毛不能在同一个牧场，因此羊只要在剪毛后进行药浴困难很多；加以这一带牧场较潮湿，绵羊容易生寄生虫病，影响到羊毛的丰收。有了流动药浴池，将能保证羊只及时进行药浴，使羊只健壮成长，羊毛丰产。
