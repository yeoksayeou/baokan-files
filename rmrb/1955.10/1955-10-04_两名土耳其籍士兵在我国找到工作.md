    Two Turkish soldiers, Salahattin Akça (military registration number 31506) and Necati Öztürk (military registration number 31069), who crossed the Korean Military Demarcation Line on February 28, 1955, and entered the military control zone of the Korean and Chinese side, have found employment in China with the help of the Chinese Red Cross.
    They originally belonged to the Turkish Brigade in Korea. After entering the military control area of the Korean and Chinese side, although the Korean and Chinese side repeatedly advised them to return to the other side, they firmly stated that they did not want to go back. On September 19, 1955, at the meeting of the secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission, our side stated to the US side: These two Turkish soldiers fled to our side seeking personal protection, and they refused to return to your side, therefore our side cannot hand them over to your side, and will assist them in realizing their wishes.
    Subsequently, these two Turkish soldiers applied through the Chinese Red Cross and were approved to come to China, and arrived in Andong on September 24th. According to their wishes, the Chinese Red Cross has now introduced them to work at the Jinan Paper Mill in Shandong.

    两名土耳其籍士兵在我国找到工作
    新华社三日讯　一九五五年二月二十八日越过朝鲜军事分界线进入朝中方面军事控制区的两名土耳其籍士兵沙拉哈丁·阿克洽（军籍号码三一五○六）和乃加梯·欧斯土鲁（军籍号码三一○六九）已经在中国红十字会的帮助下在中国获得了职业。
    他们原属于在朝鲜的土耳其旅。在进入朝中方面军事控制区后，虽经朝中方面再三劝告他们返回对方，但他们坚决表示不愿回去。一九五五年九月十九日在军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议上，我方向美方表明：这两名土耳其籍士兵逃来我方要求人身保护，他们拒绝返回你方，因而我方就不能将他们送交你方，并将协助他们实现其愿望。
    此后，这两名土耳其籍士兵通过中国红十字会申请获准前来中国，并在九月二十四日到达安东。中国红十字会根据他们的愿望，现已介绍他们到山东济南造纸厂工作。
