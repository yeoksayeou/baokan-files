Our Scientific Community Has Achieved Success in Studying Michurin's Theories

(Dispatch from this newspaper) October 27th marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of the Soviet biologist and great transformer of nature, Michurin. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies will hold a grand commemoration meeting for three consecutive days starting from October 28th. Commemorative activities will also be held in major cities across the country. Scientists will read papers and discuss the achievements of studying Michurin's theories over the past few years at these commemorative meetings.

In recent years, our country has extensively carried out activities to study Michurin's theories and has achieved remarkable results. Many outstanding Soviet biologists have come to China to lecture and conduct research, introducing Michurin's theories. A large number of works on Michurin biology have been translated and published. Biologists across the country, especially agricultural scientists, have successively conducted systematic studies of Michurin's theories. Fifteen provinces and cities, including Guangdong, Hunan, Henan, Heilongjiang, Qinghai, Xikang, and Yunnan, have held "Michurin Agricultural Plant Genetics and Breeding and Improved Seed Propagation Training Classes." Major universities and colleges have also abandoned the teaching of Mendel-Morganism and have established courses in Darwinian and Michurin biology. Michurin's reputation has also spread to the vast countryside, and many organized peasants and agricultural labor models have formed technical groups, which have inspired and enlightened the improvement of agricultural technology.

The most significant achievement of our country's study of Michurin's theories in the past six years is that many biologists have criticized the reactionary influence of Mendel-Morganism they received in the past and have turned to Michurin's theories as the guiding principle for scientific research work. In the past, the results of some biologists' work were not consistent with the theories of Mendel-Morganism, but they tried various methods to conform to this theory, so that many problems could not be solved. Now, using the results of Michurin's theories, correct explanations have been obtained. In the past, for a considerable period, the pure-line theory was the basic principle guiding the work of selecting and breeding fine varieties by agricultural scientists in our country, but in practice, good results could not be obtained for a long time. However, under the guidance of Michurin's theories, achievements have been made in the selection and breeding of fine varieties in a short period of time. For example, before liberation, due to the guidance of the pure-line theory, agricultural scientists in our country could not overcome the degradation of wheat, rice, cotton, etc. However, under the guidance of Michurin's theory, the work of variety rejuvenation is proceeding smoothly. New and excellent varieties have been created by applying asexual hybridization, sexual hybridization, and distant hybridization. The work of changing spring wheat to winter wheat has also achieved results, such as the creation of highly cold-resistant winter wheat varieties in the central part of Northeast China.

The long-term dominance of Mendel-Morganism in China's biological science community has brought about the erroneous research method of theory being divorced from reality, causing China's biological science and agricultural science workers to limit their research to laboratories, not paying attention to problems in production practice, and not paying attention to summarizing the experience of the masses of peasants. Through the study of Michurin's biological science, the working methods of biological science workers and agricultural science workers have undergone good changes. Many agricultural, forestry, and biological science research units have followed the principle of close integration of theory and practice, dispatched work teams to the field for investigation, summarized the experience of the masses of peasants, and discovered various problems in production from various specific environmental conditions to seek solutions, which has yielded good results. For example, Qu Yaoli's experience in selecting large-boll seeds for retention has been summarized and promoted. Many local fine varieties have been identified and promoted.

As a result of studying Michurin's theories, Chinese biologists have changed their understanding of growth and development and have opened up a new field for Chinese biology—the study of staged development. In the past few years, the research work on staged development has made significant contributions to production practice. For example, the research on the staged development of major crops such as rice, wheat, and cotton has provided scientific data for the control of certain characteristics of these crops, selection and breeding, rational cultivation, and seed transportation. The vernalization treatment of upland cotton has increased the yield of pre-frost flowers, increasing its total yield in northern regions.

    我科学界学习米丘林学说有成绩
    本报讯　十月二十七日是苏联生物学家、伟大的自然改造者米丘林的一百周年诞辰。中国科学院和全国自然科学专门学会联合会将从十月二十八日起连续三天举行盛大纪念会。全国各大城市也举行纪念活动。科学工作者们将在这些纪念会上宣读论文和讨论关于几年来学习米丘林学说的成绩。
    几年以来，我国广泛地开展了学习米丘林学说的活动，取得了显著的成就。苏联的许多优秀生物学家曾先后到我国讲学、考察，介绍米丘林学说；米丘林生物学的著作被大量翻译出版；全国各地的生物学者，特别是农业科学工作者，相继集中地进行了米丘林学说的系统学习，广东、湖南、河南、黑龙江、青海、西康、云南等十五个省、市曾经举办了“米丘林农业植物遗传选种及良种繁育传习班”；各大、中学校也先后摒弃了孟德尔—摩尔根主义的讲授，开设了达尔文和米丘林生物学的课程。米丘林的声名还传到了广大农村，不少组织起来的农民和农业劳动模范组织了技术小组，对改进农业技术起了鼓舞和启发作用。
    六年来我国学习米丘林学说最重大的收获是：许多生物学家批判了过去受到的孟德尔—摩尔根主义的反动影响，转而以米丘林学说作为进行科学研究工作的指导原理。过去有些生物学家的工作结果同孟德尔—摩尔根主义的理论并非一致，然而他们却以各种办法去凑合这个理论，以致许多问题都无法解决；现在应用米丘林学说的结果，就得到了正确的解释。过去在不短的期间，纯系理论是我国农业学家指导选育良种工作的基本原则，但在实践上却长期得不到良好的结果；但在米丘林学说的指导下，在不长的时间里，就在选育良种工作上取得了成就。例如解放前由于纯系理论的指导，我国的农学家无法克服小麦、水稻、棉花等的退化；但在米丘林理论指导下，顺利地进行着品种复壮工作。应用无性杂交、有性杂交以及远缘杂交，创造了新的优良品种。改变春小麦为冬小麦的工作也获得成果，如东北中部地区创造了高度耐寒的冬小麦品种。
    孟德尔—摩尔根主义在我国生物科学界的长期统治，带来了理论脱离实际的错误研究方法，使我国的生物科学和农业科学工作者把自己的研究局限在实验室里，不注意生产实践上的问题，不注意总结农民群众的经验。通过对米丘林生物科学的学习，生物科学工作者和农业科学工作者的工作方法有了良好的改变。许多农业、林业、生物科学研究单位，都遵循理论和实践紧密联系的原则，派工作队到现场调查，总结农民群众的经验，并从各种具体环境条件下去发现生产上的各项问题，求得解决的办法，收到了很好的效果。如曲耀离的选大铃留种的经验，在总结后得到推广。许多地方性的良种都得到确定和推广。
    学习米丘林学说的结果，我国生物学家改变了对生长和发育的认识，为我国生物学开辟了新的领域——阶段发育的研究。几年来，阶段发育的研究工作为生产实践作了重大的贡献。例如稻、麦、棉等主要农作物的阶段发育的研究，为这些作物的某些特性的控制、选种和合理栽培以及种子的调运，提供了科学资料。陆地棉的春化处理提高了霜前花的产量，使它在北方地区的总产量有所提高。
