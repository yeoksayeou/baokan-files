    Lanzhou is building three drainage channels and dredging fourteen branch ditches in the industrial zone this year to ensure the safety of large-scale industrial construction starting next year. At present, most of the earthwork, amounting to more than one million cubic meters, has been completed, and the excavation work for slope protection and other projects has begun. Two concrete highway bridges on the drainage channels are under construction.
    The Lanzhou industrial zone is bordered by high mountains and plateaus to the south, some peaks reaching as high as 2,700 meters. After heavy rains, flash floods erupt, heading north towards the factory area. After the completion of the drainage channels and the dredging of the branch ditches, the threat of floods can be eliminated. For example, the Baiya Gou and Hongshui Gou drainage channels can ensure that even the largest flood expected once in a century will not overflow.
    The earthwork for these flood control projects is being undertaken by the First Earthwork Engineering Team of the First Mechanical Construction Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering. They used scrapers, bulldozers and other machinery in the construction process, and the project is progressing rapidly. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)

    兰州工业区修建防洪工程
    兰州市为了保证明年开始的大规模工业建设能安全进行，今年要在工业区修建三条排洪道，疏通十四条支沟。现在，一百多万方的土方工程绝大部分已经完工，护坡等工程的挖基槽工作已经展开。排洪道上的两座混凝土公路桥正在紧张修筑。
    兰州工业区的南边是高山和高坪，有的山峰高达二千七百公尺。大雨之后，山洪暴发，由南向北直逼厂区。修建排洪道和疏通支沟的工程完成以后，可以免除洪水的威胁。如白崖沟、洪水沟两个排洪道，可以使这里百年一遇的最大洪水不至于出槽。
    这些防洪工程的土方工程，由建筑工程部第一机械施工公司第一土方工程队担负。他们在施工过程中，用铲运机、推土机等机械进行操作，工程进展很快。                   （本报驻兰州记者）
