Xinhua Bookstore Shanghai Distribution Office Compiles and Prints "Catalogue of Reading Materials for Children and Young People"
　　The Xinhua Bookstore Shanghai Distribution Office is compiling a "Catalogue of Reading Materials for Children and Young People" for schools, organizations, libraries, and parents to use as a reference when selecting reading materials for children and young people.
　　This catalogue collects children's and young people's reading materials and related books suitable for children and young people, published by various publishing houses nationwide and distributed or sold by Xinhua Bookstore since the founding of New China (October 1, 1949, to the end of September 1955). It is currently a relatively complete national catalogue of children's reading materials. The catalogue includes approximately two thousand titles of books in the categories of literature and art, social history and geography, scientific knowledge, picture stories, extracurricular activity books, learning guidance books, picture albums, picture cards, and comic books, and each is marked with its reading level. Concise content descriptions are also provided for key titles.
　　A total of 150,000 copies of this catalogue will be printed and are expected to be sent to Xinhua Bookstores in various regions from Shanghai starting at the end of October for free distribution to readers. (Xuan)
