Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 26th: London dispatch: The Chinese Art Troupe gave its first performance at the Palace Theatre on the evening of the 24th. The theater was packed with over 1,400 spectators, about 300 of whom were guests invited by Huan Xiang, China's Chargé d'Affaires in the United Kingdom.

Among those who attended the art troupe's performance were Mrs. Eden, the Queen's Private Assistant Secretary Martin Charteris and his wife, the Lord Chamberlain, Maudling of the Supply Department, Assistant Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office, Mr. W. D. Allen, and other government officials, diplomatic envoys from many countries to the United Kingdom, Summerskill, Jennie Lee, Clement Davies, Lady Jeger, Griffiths, Parkin, Silverman and other members of Parliament, Sir Loch of the British Council, Clarke, Chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain, Sir Bliss, the Master of the Queen's Music, Sir Kelly, President of the Royal Academy of Arts, Fernald, Principal of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Armstrong, Principal of the Royal Academy of Music, and other figures in the cultural and artistic circles, Dr. Johnson, the Dean of Canterbury, and prominent scientists such as Dr. Bernal, Professor Bohr, and others.

Also present at the performance were Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and Vice-Chairman Dutt, Dr. Joseph Needham, Chairman of the Britain-China Friendship Association, Dr. Jowett, William Wainwright, Organizing Secretary of the British Peace Committee, Dr. Monica Felton and Mrs. Greenbo, leaders of the British Women's Assembly, representatives of trade unions and other mass organizations.

Every performance by the Chinese Art Troupe won enthusiastic applause, and the audience repeatedly shouted, "Encore!"

As the audience left the theater after the performance, everyone unanimously praised, "Wonderful!" "Excellent!"

All major newspapers in London praised the high artistic level of the Chinese artists on the 25th.

An article in the "Daily Mail" wrote: "Last night at the Palace Theatre, when the performance of the Chinese Art Troupe reached its climax, the stage was filled with running, jumping, and spinning figures... Their speed, coordination, and movement were exciting and dazzling. I believe that after thousands of years of practice, an art will inevitably be tempered quite well... I give 'Crossroads' the highest praise."

A commentary published in the "Daily Worker" said: "The cheers that the audience gave in welcoming the Chinese Art Troupe's dance on this dazzling evening proved that their visit is not only regarded as a remarkable event in the art world, but also as a contribution to Anglo-Chinese friendship."

The "Daily Worker" also said: "This evening was an evening of color, sound, and movement, and the three were combined in a fascinating and perfect whole. It was also a thrilling evening, with fierce and dangerous mock battles, which, if not perfectly coordinated and precise, would put the performers in danger of bloodshed.

"It was a humorous evening, and the humor suddenly broke the tension of the lifelike dance. This humor comes naturally from the dancers' complex and superhuman skills... The saying that Chinese classical dance is difficult to understand immediately collapses. Because this is an art with international and amazing expressiveness."

    我国艺术团在伦敦举行首次演出
    据新华社布拉格二十六日电　伦敦消息：中国艺术团二十四日晚在皇宫剧院举行首次演出。一千四百多个观众把戏院挤得满满的，其中大约有三百人是中国驻英国代办宦乡邀请的客人。
    出席观看艺术团演出的有艾登夫人、女王的私人助理秘书马丁·恰特里斯和他的夫人、钱伯林勋爵、供应部的莫德林、外交部助理次官威·丹·艾伦和其他政府官员，许多国家驻英国的外交使节，萨末斯基尔、珍尼·李、克莱门特·戴维斯、杰格夫人、格里菲思、帕金、锡尔弗曼及其他议员，英国文化委员会的洛赫爵士、英国艺术委员会主席克拉克、女王乐师布利斯爵士、皇家艺术学院院长凯利爵士、皇家戏剧学院院长弗纳尔德、皇家音乐学院院长阿姆斯特朗等文化艺术界人士，坎特伯雷教长约翰逊博士以及名科学家柏贺浦博士、贝尔纳教授等人。
    英国共产党总书记波立特和副主席杜德，英中友好协会会长李约瑟博士、主席裘尔斯博士，英国和平委员会组织书记威廉·温莱特，英国妇女大会的领导者蒙尼卡·费尔顿博士和格林波夫人，工会及其他群众团体的代表，也出席了这次表演会。
    中国艺术团演出的每一个节目都赢得了热烈的掌声，观众一再高呼：“再来一个！”
    演出结束后观众离开剧院的时候，每个人都不约而同地称赞说：“妙极了！”“好极了！”
    伦敦所有重要的报纸二十五日都赞扬中国艺术家的高度艺术水平。
    “每日邮报”的一篇文章写道：“昨晚在皇宫剧院，当中国艺术团的表演达到最高潮的时候，舞台上充满了飞跑的、跳跃的、旋转的人影……他们的速度、配合、运动令人兴奋和眼花撩乱。我认为，经过几千年的实践必然会把一种艺术锤炼得相当好……我给予‘三岔口’以最高的评价。”
    “工人日报”刊载的评论说：“观众在欢迎中国艺术团在这个光彩夺目的晚上的舞蹈时所发出的欢呼，证明了他们这次访问不仅被人们认为是艺术界的一件了不起的大事，而且也被认为是对英中友谊的一个贡献。”
    “工人日报”又说：“这个晚上是一个有色、有声、有动作的晚上，色彩、声音和动作三者引人入胜地组合成一个完美无缺的整体。这也是一个惊险万分的晚上，那里有凶猛险恶的假战，如果不是配合得巧夺天工而无分秒之差，那就会使表演者有头破血流的危险。
    这是一个幽默的晚上，幽默突然打破了栩栩如生的舞蹈的紧张局面。这种幽默很自然地来自舞蹈者的复杂的超人绝技。……中国古典舞蹈很难了解的说法马上就不攻自破了。因为这是一种具有国际性和惊人表现力的艺术。”
