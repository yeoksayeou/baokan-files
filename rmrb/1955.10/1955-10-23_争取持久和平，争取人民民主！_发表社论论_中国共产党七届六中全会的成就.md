    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 22nd - Bucharest Dispatch: The newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, published on October 21st, 1955, issue No. 42, carried an editorial entitled "Major Events in the Life of the Communist Party of China," commenting on the achievements of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

    The editorial said that the extremely important resolutions passed by the Central Committee of the CPC, which were warmly welcomed by all the working people of the People's Republic of China, opened a new historical stage in the cause of building a socialist society in China, and these resolutions are of great international significance. The Chinese people have already made remarkable progress in all economic and cultural sectors in implementing the First Five-Year Plan. They follow the wise policies of the Communist Party, concentrating their main efforts on building a strong and advanced industry, especially their own heavy industry. The powerful movement for the socialist transformation of the countryside, which is being carried out among the rural residents of China, is growing in scale. As the plenary session pointed out, today a strong new driving force can be seen in the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives throughout the People's Republic of China. Actual life shows that the majority of peasants are determined to take the socialist road, and the cooperative movement in the Chinese countryside will soon spread throughout the country.

    The editorial concluded by saying that the Communist Party of China is greeting its Eighth National Congress as a closely united and rock-solid force. It is successfully guiding the great Chinese people to make new and enormous progress in economic development, to realize socialist industrialization in China, and to carry out the socialist transformation of the countryside, improving the material and cultural living standards of the working masses. It is constantly and unswervingly strengthening the unbreakable foundation of the worker-peasant alliance that constitutes the People's Republic of China.
