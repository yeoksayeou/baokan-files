In order to strengthen livestock's physical fitness, resist various animal epidemics, and safely get through the severe winter and spring, the vast number of herdsmen in Inner Mongolia are driving tens of thousands of livestock to graze in areas with alkali, water, and good grass. In the Xilin Gol League, which has the largest number of livestock, the entire league's empty-pregnant livestock have been organized to move pastures every ten to fifteen days since the summer fattening began. Grazing techniques have been improved, and livestock are in better condition than in previous years. In some areas of the Chahar League, livestock are already 90% fattened, and livestock throughout the region are continuously gaining weight. The Hulunbuir League is organizing and mobilizing herdsmen to fully engage in the work of fattening livestock.

    内蒙古开展保护牲畜过冬工作
    为了增强牲畜体力，抵抗各种畜疫，安全度过严寒的冬季和春天，内蒙古广大牧民正赶着成千成万的牲畜选择有碱、有水和好草的地方放牧。牲畜最多的锡林郭勒盟，从抓夏膘起，就组织全盟空胎牲畜每隔十天到十五天移场一次，改进了放牧技术，畜膘比往年较好。察哈尔盟部分地区畜膘已达九成，全区各地畜膘都在不断上升着。呼伦贝尔盟正在组织动员牧民全力投入抓膘工作。
