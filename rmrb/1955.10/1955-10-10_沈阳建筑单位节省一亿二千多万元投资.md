    Shenyang Construction Units Save Over 120 Million Yuan in Investment
    (Our Dispatch) Shenyang city's 140 basic construction units and construction enterprises, by revising project plans and reducing costs and construction costs, had saved the state a total of 122.297 million yuan in investment by the end of August.
    Many expanded and renovated factories actively saved state investment while ensuring advanced technology. In the renovation project of the Shenyang Transformer Factory, the original plan was to build a large No. 5 workshop to produce certain large products. Now, under the guidance of Soviet experts, reasonable arrangements have been made in the original No. 4 workshop, where these products can be produced, thus saving 3 million yuan in investment. The factory also cut a woodworking workshop construction project and now plans to set up the woodworking workshop in the original daily necessities workshop, with the daily necessities workshop moving to an old auxiliary building. The Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory planned to build a building for preparing synthetic paints. After learning that the Shenyang Wire Factory also produces synthetic paints, they cancelled the building. The Shenyang Wire Factory originally planned to renovate a woodworking workshop and a sawmill. After research, it was considered that a Shenyang lumber mill, with slight repairs, could produce the wood products needed by the wire factory, thus reducing this plan and saving 720,000 yuan in investment. The main factory building was originally designed with a metal floor. As suggested by Soviet experts, it was changed to an iron filings concrete floor, reducing the cost per square meter by about 91 percent, without affecting production in the slightest.
    In Shenyang's design units, revising designs according to the spirit of comprehensive conservation has saved the country a total of 58.79 million yuan in investment. The Shenyang branch of the Non-Ferrous Metallurgical Design Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry modified the designs of some dormitories, classrooms, and hospitals, appropriately reduced the thickness of the walls, and eliminated wooden floors and unnecessary equipment, reducing construction costs by an average of 50 percent compared to the original. A hospital design by the Northeast Industrial Construction Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering appropriately reduced "call signal" equipment and eliminated large chandeliers, reducing the construction cost per square meter from 118 yuan to 70 yuan. The designers of this design institute widely absorbed civil construction experience, and after repeated analysis, appraisal, and comparison, made three economic and practical standard dormitory designs.
    The construction management of various units has been continuously improved this year, which has greatly reduced costs. By the beginning of September, two construction companies, one self-operated unit, and 31 construction sites had promoted the experience of economic activity analysis. Thirty-two construction sites and more than 400 groups implemented mass cost reduction activities with team-based economic accounting. The Shenyang No. 3 Construction Engineering Company originally planned to reduce costs by 6 percent, but the average reduction in the first half of the year was 6.4 percent; July saw a reduction of 6.78 percent; and August saw a reduction of 9.13 percent. All groups in the company that implemented team-based economic accounting overfulfilled the cost reduction plan. Youth supervision posts and youth conservation teams in various units have also played a significant role in reducing project costs.
    By the end of August, a total of 14.51 million yuan of internal potential materials such as equipment, tools, and materials in Shenyang were used for construction and production. All basic construction units actively disposed of potential materials. The warehouse of the Shenyang No. 3 Engineering Company had more than 200 waste radiator fins. After welding them with brazing rods, they were all used, saving 74,800 yuan in this one item. The No. 2 Metallurgical and Mining Engineering Company established contact with rural supply and marketing cooperatives and market fairs, where they sold 578 accumulated shovels.

### 沈阳建筑单位节省一亿二千多万元投资

    沈阳建筑单位节省一亿二千多万元投资
    本报讯　沈阳市一百四十个基本建设单位和建筑企业，由于修改工程计划和降低造价、降低工程成本等，到八月末共给国家节省了一亿二千二百九十七万多元的投资。
    许多扩建和改建的工厂，在保证技术先进的前提下，积极节约国家投资。沈阳变压器厂在改建工程中，原来准备修建一所大型的五号厂房来生产某种大型产品，现在经过苏联专家的指导，在原四号厂进行了合理安排，这种产品就可以在这里生产，因而节省了三百万元的投资。这个厂还削减了一个木工车间的建筑项目，现在准备把木工车间设在原有的日用品车间里，日用品车间迁到一所旧的辅助建筑里去。沈阳高压开关厂准备修建一所配制化合漆的建筑，因为了解到沈阳电线厂也生产化合漆，他们就把这所建筑取消了。沈阳电线厂原计划改建一个木工车间和一个锯木场，后经过研究，认为沈阳市现有一个制材厂只要稍加修理，就能生产电线厂需要的木制品，因此就削减了这项计划，节省投资七十二万元。这个厂主厂房原设计为金属地面，按苏联专家建议，改为铁屑混凝土地面，使每平方公尺地面造价降低了百分之九十一左右，生产丝毫不受影响。
    在沈阳市各设计单位，根据全面节约精神修改设计以后，共为国家节约了五千八百七十九万元的投资。重工业部有色冶金设计院沈阳分院对一些宿舍、教室、医院的设计，作了修改，适当地减少了墙的厚度，取消了木地板和不必要的设备，使建筑造价比原来平均降低百分之五十。建筑工程部东北工业建筑设计院的某医院设计，适当地减少了“呼唤信号”设备，取消了大花灯等以后，使每平方公尺的建筑造价由一百一十八元降低到七十元。这个设计院的设计人员广泛地吸收了民间建筑经验，经过反复分析、鉴定、比较，作出了三种经济适用的标准宿舍的设计。
    各个单位的施工管理今年不断改善，因而使成本大为降低。到九月初，全市有两个建筑公司、一个自营单位、三十一个工地推广了经济活动分析的经验。有三十二个工地、四百多个小组实行了班组经济核算的群众性降低成本活动。沈阳市第三建筑工程公司原计划降低成本百分之六，上半年平均降低了百分之六点四；七月份降低了百分之六点七八；八月份降低了九点一三。全公司凡是实行了班组经济核算的小组，都超额完成了降低成本计划。各单位的青年监督岗、青年节约队在降低工程成本上也起了不少作用。
    到八月末，沈阳市全市计有一千四百五十一万元的设备、工具、材料等内部潜在物资用到建设和生产上去。各基本建设单位都积极处理了潜在物资。沈阳市第三工程公司仓库里有二百多片废暖气片，经过他们用生焊条焊补之后，全用上了，这一项就节约了七万四千八百多元。冶金矿山第二工程公司和农村的供销合作社和集市建立了联系，他们在合作社和集市上卖出了五百七十八把积压的铁锹。
