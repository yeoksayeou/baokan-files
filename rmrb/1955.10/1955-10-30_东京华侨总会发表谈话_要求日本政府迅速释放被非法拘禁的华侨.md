Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: According to a report in the "Akahata" on the 19th, the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association issued a statement demanding that the Japanese government "swiftly release the illegally detained Chinese nationals."

As previously reported, the Japanese government, under the pretext of "violating the Immigration Control Order," has illegally detained approximately 200 Chinese nationals for a long period in the Hamamatsu "Accommodation Center" established by the Immigration Bureau of the Ministry of Justice in Yokohama City, subjecting them to inhumane treatment. The Japanese government recently reached an "agreement" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, preparing to illegally send these Chinese nationals to Taiwan.

The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association pointed out that the Japanese government's "Immigration Control Order" is a law that disregards international law and international conventions. There was also a fierce debate in the Japanese Diet, saying that this law violates the Japanese Constitution.

The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association said that as early as this spring, it expressed to the Japanese government that overseas Chinese affairs fall within the scope of consular affairs and need to be resolved by the government in any case. If the Japanese government is sincere and intends to resolve the issue, we will dedicate ourselves to appealing to the Chinese government to conduct consultations between the two governments. In the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on August 16 and in the "People's Daily" editorial on September 14, China clearly stated its position to negotiate with the Japanese government on the issue of overseas Chinese. The Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association said: We believe that the Japanese government ignores the above facts and dares to engage in such illegal activities with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is clearly unfriendly to China.

    东京华侨总会发表谈话
    要求日本政府迅速释放被非法拘禁的华侨
    新华社二十九日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”十九日报道，东京华侨总会发表谈话，要求日本政府“迅速释放被非法拘禁的中国侨民”。
    前已报道，日本政府以“违反出入国管理令”的名义，非法将约二百名中国侨民长期拘留在法务省入国管理局设在横滨市的滨松“收容所”里，使中国侨民遭受着非人道的待遇。日本政府最近还和蒋介石卖国集团达成“协议”，准备把这些中国侨民非法押送到台湾。
    东京华侨总会指出：日本政府的“出入国管理令”是不顾国际法和国际惯例的法令。在日本国会中也曾有激烈的辩论，说这个法令是违反日本宪法的。
    东京华侨总会说：早在今年春天，它就对日本政府表示，侨民问题属于领事事务范围，无论如何需要由政府加以解决，如果日本政府怀着诚意，有意解决，我们将致力于向中国政府申诉意见，使由两国政府进行协商。中国在八月十六日的外交部发言人声明中，在九月十四日的“人民日报”社论中都曾明确表明了中国方面准备就侨民问题同日本政府进行谈判的立场。东京华侨总会说：我们认为日本政府忽视上述事实，敢于同台湾蒋介石集团进行这种非法的活动，显然是对中国不友好的。
