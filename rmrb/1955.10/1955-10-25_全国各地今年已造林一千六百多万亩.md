Afforestation work across the country has achieved results this year. According to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Forestry, over sixteen million mu of land have been afforested nationwide. Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Qinghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces have completed or exceeded their afforestation plans for this year. It is estimated that the country can exceed this year's afforestation plan of eighteen million mu. More than 180,000 mu of seedlings have also been cultivated nationwide this year. Currently, some northern provinces have begun autumn seed collection and afforestation work. In Shandong Province, Wen Deng, Rongcheng, and three other counties alone have collected more than 29,000 jin of black locust seeds. Henan Province had collected more than 700,000 jin of various tree seeds by the end of September. Xinxiang, Kaifeng, and four other special districts have also afforested more than 21,000 mu.

In this year's afforestation efforts, all regions have vigorously cultivated timber forests according to the needs of national economic construction. According to statistics from Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and other provinces, more than 6.5 million mu of timber forests such as pine, fir, and eucalyptus have been planted this year, accounting for more than 76% of the total afforestation area in these seven provinces. The area of fir forests cultivated in Jiangxi Province this spring has increased by more than five times compared to 1954. In order to increase oil production, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and four other provinces have also reclaimed and newly planted more than 920,000 mu of oil-tea camellia forests, an increase of more than seven times compared to 1954. Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi and other provinces have also planted a large number of walnut trees this year. Currently, these trees have grown.

More than 80% of the new forests cultivated in various regions this year were collectively cultivated by cooperatives and mutual aid teams. In Guangdong Province, mutual aid and cooperative organizations cultivated more than 2 million mu of new forests this spring, accounting for more than 90% of the total. In Xinshao, Xiangxiang and other counties in Hunan, the new forests cultivated by mutual aid and cooperative organizations also accounted for more than 80% of the total afforestation area. Most of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the key afforestation areas of Gansu Province have participated in afforestation work. With the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the development of afforestation work, forestry mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various regions have also greatly developed. According to incomplete statistics, more than 8,000 various types of forestry production cooperatives have been newly established nationwide this year. A large number of forestry mutual aid teams have also been developed.

During the afforestation season, Party and government leading departments in various regions have paid more attention to afforestation work than in the past, and many regions have held forestry production meetings or issued relevant afforestation instructions. Sixty-one counties in Hunan Province held forestry production meetings to make arrangements for this year's afforestation work. Zhejiang Province also held a meeting of farmer representatives from mountainous areas to specifically arrange afforestation work. Many regions have also dispatched forestry technicians to rural areas to guide the masses in improving afforestation, land preparation, planting, and other techniques, thereby increasing the survival rate of afforestation.

    全国各地今年已造林一千六百多万亩
    本报讯　今年全国各地造林工作获得成绩。据林业部不完全统计，全国已造林一千六百多万亩。湖南、湖北、安徽、江西、广东、广西、青海、浙江、福建等省完成和超额完成了今年造林计划。据估计全国可以超额完成今年一千八百万亩的造林计划。全国今年还育苗十八万多亩。目前，北方有些省份已开始秋季采种、造林工作。山东省仅文登、荣成等三县已采洋槐种子二万九千多斤。河南省到九月底止已采各种树种子七十多万斤。新乡、开封等四个专区还造林二万一千多亩。
    在今年造林中，各地都根据国家经济建设的需要，大力营造用材林。据福建、湖北、湖南、江西、四川、贵州、广东等省的统计，今年栽种了松、杉、桉等用材林六百五十多万亩，占这七省造林总面积百分之七十六以上。江西省今春营造的杉树林就比一九五四年增加五倍多。为了增产油料，今年江西、浙江等四省还垦复和新栽油茶林九十二万多亩，比一九五四年增加了七倍多。河北、山东、山西等省今年还栽种了大量核桃树。目前这些树都已生长起来。
    今年各地营造的新林，百分之八十以上是合作社和互助组集体营造的。广东省今春营造二百多万亩新林，其中互助合作组织营造的占百分之九十以上。湖南新邵、湘乡等县互助合作组织营造的新林也占造林总面积的百分之八十以上。甘肃省重点造林地区的农业互助合作组织大部分都参加了造林工作，随着农村互助合作运动的发展和造林工作的开展，各地林业互助合作组织也有了很大的发展，据不完全统计，全国今年已新建立了八千多个各种类型的林业生产合作社。还发展了大量的林业互助组。
    在造林季节里，各地党、政领导部门都比过去重视造林工作，许多地区都召开了林业生产会议或发布了有关造林指示。湖南省有六十一个县召开了林业生产会议，对今年的造林工作作了布置。浙江省还召开了山区农民代表会议，具体安排了造林工作。许多地区还抽派了林业技术人员下乡指导群众改进了造林整地、栽种等技术，提高了造林成活率。
