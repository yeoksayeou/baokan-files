Xinhua News Agency, Florence, 7th: According to TASS, the World Mayors Conference held its closing meeting on October 5th. The conference unanimously adopted a resolution drafted by a committee composed of Pira (Mayor of Florence), Yasnov (Moscow), and Wilkinson (London).

The resolution stated: "We, the mayors and representatives of mayors from thirty-seven countries around the world, met in Florence from October 2nd to 5th, 1955, and unanimously agreed to the following resolution:

(1) We affirm that, from a spiritual and material point of view, cities have value as an extremely important legacy of mankind, a legacy passed down from previous generations to the present, which can only be expanded and not destroyed, so that it can be passed on to future generations.

(2) We declare that, in the event that this legacy, created and accumulated by the labor of generations of people, is destroyed due to war, it would be an act of destroying human civilization, causing irreparable material and spiritual losses not only to this generation but also to future generations of mankind.

(3) Precisely for this reason, we urge all leaders who are responsible for the fate of the peoples of all countries to abandon war and, in the spirit of cooperation, to resolve all international disputes solely through peaceful and constructive negotiations.

In addition, we call for the development and strengthening of beneficial relations between countries in order to further develop peaceful ties in the technical, economic, social, political, cultural, and religious fields, thereby establishing a just, stable, and genuine peace for the people of the whole world."

Florence Mayor Pira announced at the conference that this resolution will be sent to the United Nations Organization, the heads of government of the United Nations member states, the four foreign ministers who will meet in Geneva, and the mayors of capitals around the world.

The conference also adopted a motion by S. Balan, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Bucharest People's Assembly: to write a letter to the United Nations Organization, stating: "We fervently hope to establish a stable and lasting peace throughout the world, and we, on behalf of the millions of residents of our respective capitals, urge the United Nations General Assembly to spare no effort to achieve positive results as soon as possible in banning atomic weapons, achieving genuine disarmament, and establishing a collective security system for all European countries and the world based on respect for the independence and national sovereignty of the peoples of all countries."

The mayors attending the conference (except for the absent Mayor Voss of Wichita, USA) all signed a document written in Greek and Latin on parchment. This document stated: "The mayors of various countries gathered in the Salone dei Cinquecento of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence pledge peace and sincere friendship to each other."
