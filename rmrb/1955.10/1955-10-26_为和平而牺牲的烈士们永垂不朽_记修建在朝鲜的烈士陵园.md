    The Martyrs Who Sacrificed for Peace are Immortal
    ——Remembering the Martyrs' Cemetery Built in Korea
    Huang Qian
    For a long time, I have been stirred by this matter, and I feel that I should tell the peace-loving people of the world, the people of the motherland, especially the families of the martyrs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army! That is, in order to forever commemorate the heroes who gloriously sacrificed in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, our Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea, in the days after the war, built solemn and beautiful cemeteries with profound significance for our deceased brothers in various famous battlefields in Korea.
    What I am talking about here is just one place. This is in the area of the heroic Mt. Yuyin battlefield and the famous Wendeng Highway front. This was originally a desolate wilderness, but now a cemetery has been built, becoming a place for people to admire.
    This central cemetery is built in a relatively flat area at the foot of a mountain, with the mountain peaks behind the cemetery like a stern barrier. There is a memorial tower more than ten meters high on the mountainside, and the copper bells on the corners of the tower occasionally emit a crisp sound in the wind. The cemetery is surrounded by a row of red railings, and below the railings is a drainage ditch paved with stones on three sides. The entrance to the cemetery is a three-story bell-tower-style mausoleum gate, with a horizontal plaque hanging on the gate, engraved with the words "Chinese People's Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery." The elegiac couplets hanging on both sides are engraved with: "Mt. Yuyin Wendeng Village, Korean-Chinese heroes win every battle; Martyrs who sacrificed for peace to protect their homeland possess a righteous and overwhelming spirit." Further inside, the mausoleum gate is an arch bridge style. A wooden image of a martyr stands on the top of the gate, holding a red flag majestically in his hand. Inside the gate are six circular flowerbeds on both sides, planted with various flowers and plants. After stepping onto the semicircular stone steps, you can see the vertical and horizontal cemetery paths and the rows of tomb ledges and tombstones. The mausoleum pavilion in the center of the cemetery is built entirely in accordance with our national style, with the surface of the pavilion radiating white light, and six red edges extending into the sky. Inside the pavilion, six semi-circular eaves boards are inlaid on six sides, with the words "Warrior Pavilion" engraved on one eaves board. On the other five eaves boards, talented soldiers carved flying white doves, jumping goldfish, and various vivid flowers and birds. In the pavilion, there is a permanent round table and four coiled-legged stools for visitors to rest here.
    Standing in front of this pavilion and looking forward, the first thing you see is a highway. How many cars are running on this highway day and night now! This is a road to victory! It is only ten li from here to the front line; three years ago, in order to compete for this road, the enemy used hundreds of tanks to charge here, but the heroes, these heroes, blocked them with their blood and lives. People can still see the wreckage of several enemy tanks beside the highway, although their heads are facing south, they did not escape their doomed fate. You can also see how lush crops are growing in the fields now, and how happily the hardworking Korean people are working. Being here, you will especially feel the loveliness of peaceful life, and you will also be unable to help but say: Our martyrs are truly the most beloved people! Yes, the images of the martyrs, pluck at people's heartstrings, making the conscience of all good people shine and their hearts burn. I once asked a soldier: "How many heroes are buried here?" But how clearly that soldier answered: "Which one of them is not a hero! All of them sacrificed for peace!" Yes, it is these martyrs, these heroes, who created the glorious victory.
    Last November, it was already the beginning of winter. On the day when the cemetery was completed, the garrison of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, the local Korean government and the people, jointly held a grand memorial service. People's mood was so heavy, many people lowered their heads and slowly carried wreaths, women carried abundant sacrifices on their heads, and many people shed tears. They used their ancient customs to set up sacrifices and mournfully read elegies. During the memorial service, the originally clear sky suddenly turned gloomy and it started to rain. However, more than a thousand people who attended the gathering did not mind. An old man spoke at the meeting, pointing to the graves in front of him and said: "Our future generations will never forget these heroes!"
    Now, our martyrs have a good resting environment, and it always seems like spring here. Flowers are blooming on the hillside and in the cemetery, and the trees that were bald from shelling have now become lush green again. Whenever people pass by here, they are full of respect, stop, look at these solemn buildings, and silently pray: The martyrs who sacrificed to defend peace, are immortal!

### 为和平而牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽——记修建在朝鲜的烈士陵园

    为和平而牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽
    ——记修建在朝鲜的烈士陵园
    黄茜
    很久以来，我心里一直为这件事情所激动，也觉得应该把这件事情告诉全世界的和平人民，祖国人民，特别是中国人民志愿军的烈属们！这就是我们在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军为了永远纪念在抗美援朝斗争中光荣牺牲的英雄们，我们在战后的日子里，在这朝鲜的各个著名战地，为自己已故的兄弟们修建了有着深远意义的、庄严美丽的陵园。
    我这里所说的只是一个地方。这是在英雄鱼隐山战地和著名的文登公路前沿一带。这里原来是一片荒芜的原野，如今修建起陵园，成为众人瞻仰的地方。
    这个中心陵园建筑在一个山下较平坦的地方，陵园后面的山峰像一座严峻的屏障。山腰中有十多公尺高的纪念塔，塔角的铜铃，随风不时发出清脆的响声。陵园四周架着一排红色的栏杆，栏杆下面有一条三面铺石的排水沟。陵园进口处是一个三层的钟楼式大陵门，门上横悬着匾额，雕刻着“中国人民志愿军烈士陵园”字样。两边挂着的挽联上刻着：“鱼隐山文登里朝中英雄百战百胜，为和平保祖国殉难烈士正气浩炽”。往里一个陵门是拱桥式的。门顶立着一个木制的烈士形象，手中威武地执着红旗。门内两边是六个圆形的花圃，栽种着各种花草。踏上半圆形的石级路后，就看到那纵横的陵路和成行的墓坎、墓碑。陵园中心的陵亭，是完全按照我国民族形式建筑的，亭面放射着白色的光泽，六个红色的棱角伸向天空。亭内六个边镶着六块半月形的檐板，一个檐板刻着“勇士亭”三字，在另五个檐板上，天才的战士们雕刻了飞翔的白鸽，跳跃的金鱼和各种生动的花鸟。亭中有一张永久性的圆桌和四个蜷足形凳子，供来瞻仰的人们在这里休息。
    站在这个亭前你向前眺望，首先看到的是一条公路。现在白天黑夜有多少汽车在这公路上奔跑啊！这是一条胜利的道路！从这里到前沿只不过十华里；三年前，敌人为了争夺这条路，曾用成百辆的坦克向这里冲锋，可是，英雄们，就是这些英雄们以自己的鲜血和生命挡住了它们。人们至今还可以看到公路旁那几辆敌人坦克的残骸，尽管它们的头朝着南方，但是并没有逃脱灭亡的命运。你还可以看到，如今，那田野里长着一片多么茁壮的庄稼，勤劳的朝鲜人民又是怎样愉快地劳动着。置身在这里，你会特别感受到和平生活的可爱，你也会情不自禁地说：我们的烈士们，实实在在是最可爱的人！是的，烈士们的形象，拨动着人们的心弦，使一切善良的人的良心发亮，心胸发热。我曾问过一个战士：“这里埋葬着几位英雄？”可是那战士回答得多么明朗：“他们那一个不是英雄！全是为和平而牺牲的！”是的，正是这些烈士们，英雄们，才创造了光辉的胜利。
    去年十一月，那已是初冬的季节，当陵园落成的那一天，中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的驻军，当地朝鲜政府和人民群众，共同召开了一个隆重的追悼大会。人们的心情是那样的沉重，许多人低着头，缓步地抬着花圈，妇女们顶着丰盛的祭品，许多人流着眼泪。他们用自己古老的习惯，摆设祭礼，哀读祭文。在追悼会中，原来明朗的天空，突然变得阴沉，下起雨来。可是，参加集会的一千多人，谁也没有介意。有一个老大爷在会上讲话，他指着面前的坟墓说：“我们的万代子孙，决不会忘记这些英雄！”
    如今，我们的烈士们有了一个良好的安息环境，这里永远像是春天。山坡上，陵园内开着鲜花，被炮弹打秃了的树木，现在又变得一片葱绿。每当人们在这里经过的时候，都是满怀着尊敬，停下脚步，瞻望一下这些庄严的建筑，并且默默地祷念：为保卫和平而牺牲的烈士们，永垂不朽！
