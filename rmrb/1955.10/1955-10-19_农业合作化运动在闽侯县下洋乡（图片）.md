Agricultural Cooperation Movement in Xiyang Township, Minhou County

    The agricultural cooperation movement in Xiyang Township, Minhou County, Fujian Province is flourishing. Under the leadership of the Party, the township has launched a study of agricultural cooperation issues, held training courses for key personnel in running cooperatives, and gathered outstanding Party members, League members, and local activists to learn the policies and methods of running cooperatives. It has also organized farmers to visit and learn from older cooperatives. The local supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives are also preparing to expand the supply of means of production and other supporting work to welcome the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperation.

    农业合作化运动在闽侯县下洋乡
    福建省闽侯县下洋乡的农业合作化运动正在蓬勃展开。在党的领导下，全乡展开了农业合作化问题的学习，举办了办社骨干训练班，把优秀的党、团员和乡里的积极分子集中起来学习办社的政策和办法，并且组织农民向老社参观访问；当地的供销合作社和信用合作社也正为迎接农业合作化高潮的到来，作好扩大生产资料的供应和其他各种配合工作。
