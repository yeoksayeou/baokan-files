The Bountiful Irrigation Area of Dujiangyan

By our reporter Ji Xichen

In September, on the fertile Chengdu Plain, the ripened rice swayed in the wind with heavy ears, like a boundless ocean with undulating waves. In the golden fields, men and women farmers busily harvesting waved their sickles. On the threshing drums, sheds, mats, and cloth pockets were set up. Newly created wooden hand-cranked threshing machines roared, like small boats traveling in the waves. Every courtyard house surrounded by bamboo fences was filled with piles of sheaves and grain stores.

This year is the sixth consecutive bumper harvest year for the Chengdu Plain. The average yield of rice per mu has increased by more than 120% compared to before liberation. Many agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams have overfulfilled their production increase plans. The original estimate for Gongping Township in Wenjiang County was that it would increase rice production by 300,000 jin compared to last year, but the actual harvest increased by more than 450,000 jin. The Liming Agricultural Cooperative in Qionglai County achieved an average of 718 jin per mu for more than 60 mu of rice. And the early rice fields of the No. 11 Village Agricultural Cooperative in Hedeng Township, Xinfan County, yielded 1,933 jin. The Red Star No. 2 Cooperative in Hexing Township, Pi County, increased production by 19% compared to last year. The four grain-deficient households in the cooperative last year have all become surplus grain households this year, and all 35 cooperative members' families have surplus grain.

"Thousands of miles of fertile land, the Land of Abundance." On this plain covering more than 3,000 square kilometers, the Dujiangyan irrigates more than a dozen counties and cities including Chengdu, Wenjiang, Pi County, Xinfan, Guan County, and Xindu, benefiting more than three million farmers and more than four million mu of cultivated land. On this fertile land, two to three crops can be harvested continuously in a year, with an average grain yield of about 1,200 to 1,300 jin per mu. Wenjiang Prefecture, which is mostly part of the Dujiangyan irrigation area, produces 4 billion jin of grain annually, of which 3 billion jin is rice. People affectionately call it the granary of the motherland.

In addition to grain, the Dujiangyan irrigation area also abounds in more than 200 kinds of industrial crops and medicinal materials such as oil crops, tobacco, hemp, Alisma orientalis, and chuanxiong. Economic and technical crops account for a large proportion of farmers' economic life, in some counties reaching more than two-thirds of total income. Chengdu's exquisite "Shu brocade," Xinfan County's various exquisite palm fiber woven products, and the large quantities of sweet oranges and tangerines produced in Jintang, Guanghan, and other counties sell well throughout the country. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the partially opened Baoji-Chengdu Railway have enabled the large quantities of medicinal materials, hemp, vegetable oil, pig bristles, casings, and other bulk materials that could not be transported out in previous years to be sold smoothly to other places. Due to the development of transportation, the price difference between industrial and agricultural products has narrowed, and rural areas have received a large supply of daily-use industrial products and various new agricultural implements, chemical fertilizers, and other means of production.

The great land reform movement returned the fertile land and convenient water conservancy to the hands of the peasants, and the reform of the agricultural cultivation system further opened up a broad road to increased production on the Chengdu Plain. Potatoes, which had never been grown on the plains before, had their first bumper harvest on the plains in 1954. Fields that had only yielded two crops in previous years can now generally yield three to four crops after the promotion of planting an additional crop. Green manure and forage crops such as vetch and broad beans are planted in the paddy fields, followed by spring potatoes, wheat, rapeseed, tobacco, hemp, and other minor spring crops, and then another crop of rice. After planting broad beans and winter potatoes in dry land, corn and intercropped sweet potatoes are planted, increasing the total yield by 30% to 50% compared to planting two crops. In 1955, Wenjiang Prefecture increased the planting of short-term crops by 1.25 million mu, and it is estimated that it can increase grain production by more than 58 million jin and increase the harvest of green manure and forage by more than 56 million jin. For many years, minor spring crops, which accounted for only a very small percentage of the total annual income, have now jumped to more than half of the total income of farmers.

The vigorous agricultural cooperativization movement has brought infinitely bright prospects to the Dujiangyan irrigation area. With the help of the People's Government, agricultural cooperatives are increasingly adopting new farming techniques. Double-wheeled, double-shared plows have replaced some of the ancient wooden plows, and some are even using seeders. Tractors from state-owned farms in Pi County and other places come and go, helping agricultural cooperatives cultivate the land. Many of the small fields that were once separated by countless field boundaries into strips and blocks have been voluntarily combined by farmers into plots of dozens of mu. The field boundaries that have been removed and the small ditches that have been filled have been used to expand the planting area, all of which guarantee the agricultural cooperatives a rich harvest. The more than 3,000 agricultural cooperatives in the entire irrigation area had a bumper harvest of spring and autumn crops in 1955, with an average increase of about 5%, and the income of cooperative members generally increased. For example, Tang Shoufa, a farmer in Hedeng Township, Xinfan County, had an income of 7,000 jin of grain equivalent before joining the cooperative in 1952, which was only enough for his family to eat. In 1953, after joining the cooperative, he received 8,800 jin of rice and bought three pigs. In 1954, his income totaled more than 10,050 jin of grain equivalent, and in 1955 it increased to 12,000 jin, and his whole family lived a life of increasing prosperity.

Three years ago, when the agricultural cooperative organized by Luo Shifa, a representative of the National People's Congress, appeared on the Chengdu Plain, farmers who came to visit asked the cooperative members with surprise and suspicion: Are you not afraid of fighting? Do you eat from the same pot and sleep under the same quilt? However, only three years have passed, and people's views on agricultural cooperatives have fundamentally changed! By the spring of 1955, more than 118,000 households in Wenjiang Prefecture had joined agricultural cooperatives, accounting for 11.3% of the total number of farm households. Around the autumn harvest, under the active leadership of the local party committees and the demonstration of old cooperatives, a new situation of entire groups, batches, and areas signing up to establish cooperatives appeared in the cooperativization movement on the Chengdu Plain. Many mutual aid teams have imitated the organizational forms and management methods of agricultural cooperatives and organized themselves into more than 12,000 joint teams. The joint teams have not only accumulated public property, but some have also collectively managed land, actively creating conditions for the establishment of cooperatives. In order to meet the masses' demands for joining cooperatives, the Wenjiang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China decided that by the spring of 1956, the number of agricultural cooperatives in the region would be developed to more than 12,000. At that time, in the plain area stretching 130 li from east to west and more than 250 li from north to south, including 800,000 farm households, and the hilly areas close to the plain, agricultural cooperativization could be achieved.

With the development of agricultural production and the improvement of people's economic life, people's demands for cultural life have also become stronger. Almost every village on the plain has a primary school, and the entire region has more than 30 middle schools and normal schools, while farmers' spare-time schools, night schools, and literacy classes are spread all over the area. During the slack farming season, cultural centers and amateur theater troupes often perform and hold various cultural and recreational activities. In villages equipped with radios and wired broadcasting stations, farmers can hear news, dramas, and reports day and night. Every village has farmers' newspaper reading groups and blackboards. Now, cultural activities have become an indispensable part of farmers' lives.

Dujiangyan is the source of happiness for the people of western Sichuan and one of the greatest water conservancy projects in Chinese history, created more than 2,200 years ago. Later, through continuous improvement by the people of all generations, it has developed into its current scale with 656 branch canals and more than 2,600 sub-canals, irrigating more than 4 million mu of land. However, before liberation, this great project was riddled with holes, so that the irrigated area became smaller and smaller, decreasing from the original 3 million mu to 1.9 million mu by 1949. After liberation, Dujiangyan has undergone more than five years of repairs, and its appearance has fundamentally changed. In addition to continuously carrying out annual repairs and restoring the original irrigated area, the People's Government has also newly built projects such as the Guanqu Yian and the Xihie Yian, expanding the irrigated area by more than 1 million mu, turning "dry" Peng County into "water" Peng County, so that places that originally dug ponds to store water and used cattle to pull waterwheels to irrigate fields now have "tap water." Small rivers and ditches that used to have no water at all in a drought now have clear running water all year round, guaranteeing increased agricultural production. The farmland irrigated by the Xihie Canal alone can increase rice production by 13.5 million jin every year. In addition, reinforced concrete gates have been built at the river mouths of Pupai River, Zouma River, and Shidi Dike, new dikes have been added, and irrigation management has been strengthened, so that the vast farmland can get water in time and prevent floods.

In order to fully utilize Dujiangyan's flood control and irrigation functions and fully utilize the abundant water power of the Min River, a large-scale hydroelectric power station is currently being surveyed and built near Dujiangyan. Hundreds of survey team members cross high mountains, wade through rapids, and pass through forests that block out the sun, conducting topographic and geological surveys, collecting hydrological data, conducting economic surveys, and drilling at the dam site of the hydropower station on the Min River for more than 200 li from Guan County to Mao County. According to preliminary calculations, several hydropower stations can be built after the cascade development of the Min River. The completion of the hydropower station near Dujiangyan can not only supply a large amount of electricity to the Chengdu area, but also use the reservoir to control floods and regulate the flow of the Min River, expand the irrigated area, and make the rich Chengdu Plain even more prosperous and beautiful!

    富饶的都江堰的灌溉区
    本报记者　纪希晨
    九月，在富饶的川西平原上，成熟了的稻子，迎风摇曳着沉重的穗子，像一片波浪起伏的无边的海洋。金黄色的田野里，忙着收割的男女农民们，挥舞着镰刀。打谷的拌桶上，架起天棚、围席和布兜，新创造的木质手摇打谷机，轰隆发响，好像行进在波浪中的小艇一样。每一座竹篱环抱的院落房屋里，都堆满着禾垛和谷屯。
    今年是川西平原的第六个丰收年。每亩水稻平均产量较解放前提高百分之一百二十以上。许多农业合作社和互助组，都超额完成了增产计划。温江县公平乡原来估计可比去年增产稻谷三十万斤，实际收成却比去年增产四十五万多斤。邛崃县黎明农业合作社，六十多亩水稻每亩平均达七百一十八斤。而新繁县禾登乡十一村农业合作社二亩多早谷田，则打了一千九百三十三斤。郫县合兴乡红星二社比去年增产百分之十九，社里去年的四户缺粮户，今年都变成了余粮户，三十五户社员家家有余粮。
    “沃野千里，天府之国”，在这面积三千多平方公里的平原上，都江堰灌溉着成都、温江、郫县、新繁、灌县、新都等十数个县、市，受益农民达三百多万，受益耕地达四百多万亩。在这肥沃的土地上，一年可连续收获两次到三次，每亩土地平均产粮一千二三百斤左右。大部属于都江堰灌区的温江专区，每年产粮四十亿斤，其中水稻即三十亿斤，人们亲切地叫她为祖国的粮仓。
    都江堰灌区除出产粮食外，还盛产油料、烟、麻、泽泻、川芎等二百多种技术作物和药材。经济技术作物在农民经济生活中占很大比重，有些县则达总收入的三分之二以上。成都市精美的“蜀锦”，新繁县各种精致的棕丝织品，以及金堂、广汉等县出产的大量甜橙、红橘，畅销全国各地。成渝铁路和部分通车的宝成铁路，使历年不能外运的药材、大麻、菜油、猪鬃、肠衣等大宗物资，都能畅销外地了。由于交通事业的发展，工农产品之间的差价缩小了，农村里得到大批日用工业品和各式新式农具、化学肥料等生产资料的供应。
    伟大的土地改革运动，使肥沃的土地和方便的水利，回到了农民的手中，而农业耕作制度的改革，更给川西平原开拓了广阔的增产道路。从没下过山的马铃薯，一九五四年第一次丰收在平原上，历年来只收获两季的田，在推广增种一季以后，普遍可以收获三次至四次。水田中种了苕子、葫豆等绿肥饲料作物，再种春马铃薯、小麦、油菜、烟、麻等小春作物，然后再种一季水稻。旱地种了葫豆、冬马铃薯以后，再种玉蜀黍和套种甘薯，使全部产量比种两季提高百分之三十到五十。一九五五年温江专区增种短期作物一百二十五万亩，预计可增产粮食五千八百多万斤，多收绿肥和饲料五千六百万斤。许多年来，在全年总收入中只占极少数的小春作物，现在一跃而达农户总收入的半数以上。
    蓬勃的农业合作化运动，给都江堰灌区带来无限美好的前程。农业合作社在人民政府的帮助下，日益增多地采用新的耕作技术。双轮双铧犁代替了一部分古老的木犁，有的还用上了播种机。郫县等地国营农场的拖拉机来往驰骋，帮助农业合作社耕种土地。过去被无数田界隔断成一条条、一块块的小田地，有许多都被农民们自愿联合成几十亩大的田块了。被铲除的地界和被填平的小河沟，都用来扩大种植面积，所有这些都保证农业合作社有丰富的收成。全灌区三千多个农业合作社，一九五五年小春和秋收普遍丰收，平均增产百分之五左右，社员收入普遍增加。例如新繁县禾登乡农民唐守发，入社前，一九五二年收入折谷七千斤，全家仅够吃用。一九五三年入了社，分到稻谷八千八百斤，买上了三只猪，一九五四年收入折谷共有一万零五十多斤，一九五五年又增加到一万二千斤，全家过着日益富裕的生活。
    三年前，当全国人民代表大会代表罗世发组织的农业合作社出现在川西平原上时，前来参观的农民怀着惊喜、怀疑心情，问社员们：你们不怕打架吗？吃大锅饭、盖大被盖吗？可是，时间仅仅过了三年，人们对农业合作社的看法，已根本改变了！到一九五五年春，温江专区已有十一万八千多户加入了农业合作社，入社农户达总农户的百分之十一点三。秋收前后，在各地党委积极领导和老社带头示范下，川西平原合作化运动，出现了整组、成批、成片报名建社的新局面。许多互助组仿照农业合作社的组织形式和经营方法，组织成了一万二千多联组，联组内不但积累了公共财产，有的还集体经营土地，积极为建社创造条件。为满足群众入社要求，中共温江地委决定，一九五六年春，全区农业合作社发展到一万二千多个，那时，在东西宽一百三十里，南北长二百五十多里，包括八十万农户的平原地区，和接近平原的丘陵地区，便可达到农业合作化了。
    随着农业生产的发展，人民经济生活的改善，人们对文化生活的要求也更加强烈起来。平原上几乎每个村庄都有小学，全区共有三十多所中学和师范学校，而农民业余学校、夜校和识字班则遍布各地。在农闲的时候，文化馆、业余剧团，常常演出和举行各种文娱活动。在装置有收音机和有线广播站的乡村里，农民们日夜都可听到新闻、戏剧和报告。每一个村子都有农民的读报组和黑板报，现在文化活动已成为农民不可缺少的生活内容之一了。
    都江堰是川西人民幸福的源泉，是我国历史上最伟大的水利工程之一，创修在二千二百多年以前。后来经过历代人民不断改进，才发展成为现在拥有分渠六百五十六条，支渠二千六百多条，灌溉土地四百多万亩的规模。但在解放前，这一伟大的工程到处千疮百孔，以致灌溉面积愈来愈小，至一九四九年，已由原灌的三百万亩减至一百九十万亩。解放以后，都江堰经过五年多的修治，面貌已经根本改变。人民政府除不断进行岁修，恢复了原灌面积外，并新修了官渠堰、西河堰等工程，扩大灌溉面积一百多万亩，把“干”彭县变成了“水”彭县，使原来挖塘蓄水，用牛马拉水车灌田的地方，都有了“自来水”。从前天一旱就没有一点水的小河沟，现在却成年是清清的流水，保证了农业的增产。仅西河渠灌溉的农田，每年就可以增产大米一千三百五十万斤。此外，还在蒲柏河、走马河、石堤堰等地河口上，修建了钢筋水泥的闸门，增修了新堤坝，加强了灌溉管理，使广大农田及时得到用水，防止洪水的泛滥。
    为了充分发挥都江堰防洪、灌溉作用，充分利用岷江丰富的水力，现在都江堰附近正在勘察修建一个规模巨大的水力发电站。几百个勘察队员，越过高山，涉过激流，穿过遮蔽天日的森林，在从灌县到茂县两百多里的岷江上，进行地形、地质测量，搜集水文资料，进行经济调查和水电站坝址的钻探工作。据初步计算，岷江经过梯级开发后，可以建成好几座水电站。都江堰附近水电站的建成，不但可以供应成都地区大量用电，同时水库还可以用来防洪和调剂岷江的流量，扩大灌溉面积，使富饶的川西平原变得更加繁荣美丽！
