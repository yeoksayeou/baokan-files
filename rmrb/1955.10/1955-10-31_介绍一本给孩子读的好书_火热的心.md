    Introducing a Good Book for Children: "A Fiery Heart"
    By Xie Liming, published by the China Children's Publishing House. By Wei Junyi

    In recent years, the products of our garden of children's literature have been scarce. And in this sparsely cultivated garden, some people are working hard to reap some fruits. I have read a dozen or so children's literature works published this year, and I think there are still some good ones among them. I cannot introduce them all here, but only talk about one that I particularly like, "A Fiery Heart."

    This book, in the tone of a letter from an air force soldier to a child, writes about how this air force soldier, after being seriously injured and disabled, overcame difficulties, persisted in training, regained his flying qualifications, and as a result, shot down enemy planes in air combat and established meritorious service. The story is very touching.

    Gorky once said: "Children are born with a desire for bright and extraordinary things." They have always liked novel stories, vivid and interesting, and thrilling plots. For children in their teens, everything is new. They are always wide-eyed, eager to explore all the novelties in this world, and always have some fantasies, wanting to take risks and create extraordinary heroic deeds. Children hope that literary works can meet this requirement. This requirement cannot be denied and must be satisfied.

    We have read some works that write about the lives of children today, about their daily studies, games, and team activities, etc., which are very beautiful and interesting. The works published this year such as "Little Fatty and Little Song," "Welcome Little Raindrops," and "The Sooner the Better" are all such works. However, children's reading materials are not enough with only this aspect, and there should also be some works that can satisfy children's curiosity, arouse children's hearts, and radiate wonderful brilliance.

    Where are the most extraordinary and newest things? They are in our real life! More than one person has said that our Five-Year Plan, filled with numbers, is actually the most beautiful poem of modern times. It is reality, a scientific plan, and also an ideal, the most precious imagination of our people. The most heart-stirring miracles are created by the ordinary people of this era. The most amazing adventures are the undertakings being carried out on our borders, islands, in the Great Northern Wilderness, and in mountain exploration teams. Our responsibility is to guide children to see these real miracles in real life, which are much more thrilling and interesting than those fabricated martial arts and immortal stories.

    The air force soldier written in "A Fiery Heart" had his leg bone broken into three pieces, treated for nine months, and eventually became disabled. Such a person was able to fly into the sky and shoot down the ace pilot of the American invading army. Isn't this a miracle? Guan Yu scraping his bones to remove poison is a miracle of ancient legends. After being seriously injured, our air force soldier had two doctors pull his leg bone straight in the bandage room, and he still smiled and encouraged them:

    "Pull hard!" Isn't this a miracle? A disabled soldier who had never swam before was able to learn to swim in the stormy sea in a short period of time in a sanatorium. Isn't this a miracle? Although the author has already told us at the beginning of the story that Sun Guorui can fly again, we still cannot help but care about every step of the fate of this child-loving pilot as we read letter after letter. He fell so hard, how could he fly? His broken leg was in a plaster bandage for five months and had not yet healed, how could he train well in the future? He was about to drown in the sea, could he swim back? Reading on, I feel that the story can grab people.

    In addition, the story of this hero is written very kindly. This is a prominent feature of this work. The author writes the heart of this battle-hardened hero so purely and clearly that it can communicate with the heart of a child. The book is full of extremely fierce life-and-death struggles, and at the same time, it is full of revolutionary optimism, which makes children feel that completing heroic deeds is very difficult, but also very happy and natural; they will feel that there is nothing more joyful in the world than taking risks to do heroic deeds. If you were to put the children in that situation, they would probably want to do it that way, and they would do it that way. The sections in the book about Sun Guorui enduring the pain of treatment after being seriously injured, encountering danger at sea, and being examined after his injury healed are all better. Those are all very tense scenes, and reading about Sun Guorui fighting the waves will make the reader anxious. The author did not use a lot of obscure and bizarre psychological descriptions to write about this hero who is fighting. This hero did not have any wild thoughts or psychological distortions in times of crisis, which is completely opposite to the heroes written by the likes of Lu Ling. He only thought for a moment: "I have to muster my strength" to "save a soldier" for the Korean aunt and child. But he does not become a person without character because of this. Some paragraphs, such as writing about him being examined by the doctor, and he pretended not to be in pain when the doctor pinched him hard, even reveal natural humor and wit. These places make children smile happily for this hero who is a bit naughty like them.

    We know that Soviet works such as "The Story of Zoya and Shura," "An Ordinary Soldier," and "Gulia's Road" are welcomed by young readers, and this is not accidental. They write about complex and huge heroic deeds, but at the same time, these deeds and these characters are written so simply, plainly, and clearly that even children can easily understand and approach them. "A Fiery Heart" naturally cannot be compared with these works, it is still too simple and rough. But it does have such an advantage, the simple and clear description makes children feel that they can understand heroes, and that heroes are fundamentally the same as them. – And the fact is originally like this.

    In the progress of the plot, there is one thing that can be criticized, that is, the reason why Sun Guorui almost drowned in the sea. The author handled it as the seaside sanatorium had already posted a notice that the weather was going to change, but Sun Guorui ignored this notice and went into the sea alone, and as a result, the comrades of the seaside sanatorium rescued him with a lifebuoy. Writing about Sun Guorui's bitter struggle at sea is touching, but children will ask after reading it: What if the comrades of the sanatorium couldn't find him? Wouldn't this hero sacrifice himself for his accidental mistake? He shouldn't have ignored the notice and left the group to go into the sea alone! Naturally, heroes are not necessarily free from any accidental mistakes. We certainly do not require him to conduct a "ideological examination" and unfold the struggle of inner contradictions when he is fighting against storms and waves. However, the author and the hero Sun Guorui should have a response to the questions that the children will raise as mentioned above. But in the work, the hero did not feel anything about making this mistake. It seems that he affirmed it. This kind of handling is not good for expressing the hero's character.

    But this does not detract from the main advantages of the work. We urgently need more children's literature works to be produced. At this time, all works that can give children some beneficial nutrition should be encouraged. I think works like "A Fiery Heart" should be encouraged.

    介绍一本给孩子读的好书——“火热的心”
    谢力鸣著　少年儿童出版社出版　韦君宜
    近年来，我们的少年儿童文学园地的产品是很少的。而在这出产很少的园地上，还有些人努力耕耘，收下一些果子来。我读了十来本今年出版的少年儿童文学作品，觉得这里边还是很有些好的。这里不能一一加以介绍，只谈谈自己比较喜欢的一本“火热的心”。
    这本书用一位空军战士给一个孩子的信的口吻，写这位空军战士受重伤残废之后，克服困难，坚持锻炼，又重新取得飞行资格，结果在空战中又打落了敌机，建立了功劳。故事是很动人的。
    高尔基曾经说过：“儿童的天性生来就有一种追求光明的、不平凡的事物的意向。”他们从来就喜欢新奇的故事，喜欢生动有趣的、惊心动魄的情节。对十来岁的孩子来说，一切都是新鲜的。他们时刻大睁着明亮的眼睛想探求这个世界里的一切新奇，时刻都怀着一些幻想，想去冒险，想去创造不平常的英雄事业。孩子们希望文学作品能够满足这个要求。这个要求是不能予以否认，必须给以满足的。
    我们读到了一些写今天儿童生活的作品，写他们日常的学习、游戏和队的生活等等，那是很优美、很有趣味的。今年出版的“小胖和小松”“欢迎小雨点”“越早越好”等就都是这样的作品。但是，少年儿童读物单有这一方面的还不够，还应当有一些能满足儿童的好奇心，能唤起儿童心灵激动的、散发着奇丽的光彩的作品。
    哪里有最不平凡的、最新奇的事物？那就在我们的现实生活里！不止一个人说过，说我们的充满了数字的五年计划，实在是现代最美丽的诗篇。它是现实，是科学的计划，同时又是理想，是我们人民的最珍奇的想像。最能激动心灵的奇迹，就是这个时代的普通人民创造出来的。最惊人的冒险事业，就是正在我们的边疆、海岛上，在北大荒，在山野勘探队中进行着的事业。我们的责任，就是要引导孩子们看到这些现实生活中的真正奇迹，这是比那些假造的武侠剑仙之类的故事更惊心动魄得多，有趣味得多的。
    “火热的心”所写的空军战士，腿骨断成了三截，治疗了九个月，最后还落了个残废。这样的人，竟能够飞上天去，打落美国侵略军的王牌驾驶员。这可不是奇迹？关云长刮骨疗毒，就是古来传说的奇迹了，我们这位空军战士在重伤之后，在包扎所里让两个医生拉正腿骨，还笑着鼓励人家：
  “用劲拉”，这可不是奇迹？一个从来不会游泳的残废军人，能够在疗养院内短期学会在狂风暴雨的大海中游泳，这可不是奇迹？虽然作者在故事一开始的时候就已经告诉了我们，孙国瑞又能飞行了，可是我们一封信一封信地读下去，总还是不能不关心这个爱孩子的飞行员的每一步命运。他摔得那么重，怎么能飞？他的断腿打了五个月石膏绷带还没有接上，以后怎么练得好？他在大海里就快要淹死了，能不能游回来呢？读下去，觉得故事能抓住人。
    此外，这个英雄的故事，是写得很亲切的。这是这篇作品的一个显著特点。作者写这个身经百战的英雄的心，是这样单纯而明朗，能够和孩子的心相通。书里面有着极其激烈的生死斗争，同时又充满了革命的乐观主义，这使孩子们读了，会觉得去完成英雄业迹是十分艰巨，但又是十分快乐、十分自然的；会觉得世界上再没有什么比冒着艰险干英雄事业更快乐的事了。要叫孩子们自己处在那个条件下，大概也就想那么干，会那么干。书中所写的孙国瑞重伤后忍着痛受治疗的一段，海上遇险的一段和伤好后受检查的一段都比较好。那都是很紧张的场面，读到孙国瑞和海浪搏斗的地方是会使读者着急的。作者写这个正在搏斗中的英雄，并没有采用大量艰涩离奇的心理描写。这个英雄在危难的时候并没有什么胡思乱想，心理变态，这和路翎之流所写的英雄完全相反。他只想了一想：“要拿出力量来”，要为朝鲜大娘和孩子“保存一个战士”。而他并不因此而成为没有性格的人。有些段落，例如写他受医生检查，明明医生捏得他很疼，他还装做不疼的地方，更流露出自然的幽默风趣。这些地方，使孩子们读了，会为这个和他们一样有点顽皮的英雄快乐地微笑的。
    我们知道苏联作品“卓娅和舒拉的故事”“普通一兵”“古丽雅的道路”等为少年儿童读者所欢迎，这不是偶然的。它们写的是繁复的巨大的英雄事迹，但同时这些事迹，这些人物又是写得那样单纯平易和明朗，连孩子也很容易理解，容易亲近。“火热的心”自然还不能和这些作品相比，它还是太简单些，粗糙些。但是它却也有这么一个好处，单纯明朗的描写，使孩子们读了之后会觉得他们能够理解英雄，英雄和他们在根本上是一样的人。——而事实原来也正是这样。
    作品在情节进展中间，有一点可以提出批评的地方，那就是关于孙国瑞为什么会在大海里几乎淹死的原因。作者把它处理成为海滨疗养院早已挂牌预告天气要变，孙国瑞却忽略了这个预告，一个人去下海，结果还是海滨疗养院的同志带着救生圈把他救了回来。写孙国瑞的海上苦斗是动人的，但是，孩子们读过了会问：如果疗养院的同志找不到他呢？那这个英雄不是会为了自己偶然的错误而白白牺牲掉吗？他不该不重视预告，离开集体一个人去下海！自然，英雄并不是一定就不会有任何偶然错误。我们也决不要求在他同暴风巨浪搏斗时去让他进行“思想检查”，展开内心矛盾的斗争。但是，作者和英雄孙国瑞对以上所说的孩子们会提出的问题，是应该有答复的。而在作品中，英雄犯了这个错误却是一点儿也不觉得。看来是肯定了它。这样处理对表现英雄性格是没有好处的。
    但这不妨碍作品的主要优点。我们迫切需要有更多的少年儿童文学作品产生。在这时候，凡是能给少年儿童一些有益的营养的作品，都是应当受到鼓励的。像“火热的心”这样的作品，我以为就应当受到鼓励。
