Observer's Commentary:

	DULLES MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO DISTORT THE FACTS

	U.S. Secretary of State Dulles mentioned the issue of fifteen American airmen in his speech on October 10. Dulles went to great lengths to distort this issue, which cannot be allowed to pass ambiguously.

	These fifteen people mentioned by Dulles are the four American airmen, including Fischer, who violated Chinese airspace, and the eleven American airmen, including Arnold, who infiltrated China for espionage activities. If Dulles had any self-awareness, he should know that he'd better not mention this matter that makes the United States very disreputable. However, Dulles, based on the principle of telling big lies if you're going to lie, described China's sentencing of these fifteen American airmen as "violating the Korean Armistice Agreement" and a "serious provocation," and the release of these fifteen American airmen as a result of "relying on the moral pressure exerted by the United Nations."

	Here, one cannot help but think of the special report issued by United Nations Secretary-General Mr. Hammarskjöld on September 12 regarding his contact with the government of the People's Republic of China. This special report is insufficient and not objective in many respects, especially as it stands on the position of the manipulated majority of countries in the United Nations, linking the American airmen who violated Chinese law with the illegal resolution passed by the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1954. Mr. Hammarskjöld did not mention the position repeatedly explained to him by the Chinese government in his special report, but instead published the following so-called "background material" together with the report: "In the talks in Beijing and all subsequent contacts, the People's Republic of China has consistently maintained the attitude towards the facts that it had repeatedly announced publicly. Mr. Zhou Enlai said: The release of the four and eleven airmen was an action taken by the Chinese government on its own initiative based on its sovereignty, unrelated to the United Nations resolution. It was an action taken in accordance with Chinese policy and legal procedures and out of a desire to ease tensions." Mr. Hammarskjöld's special report became an official document of the United Nations, but the so-called "background material" he published was blocked by the Western press. It is this extremely unfair situation that has given Dulles a favorable condition to distort the facts and emphasize the so-called "moral pressure of the United Nations."

	However, the truth of the facts cannot be blocked, and even less can any distortion be allowed.

	The infiltration of China by Arnold and the other eleven, and Donnely and the other two American spies, to carry out subversive activities is an undeniable fact with conclusive evidence. Sentencing American spies captured within China is entirely within China's sovereignty and internal affairs, and the United Nations has no right to interfere according to its charter. Instead of condemning the United States for violating the United Nations Charter by sending spies to infiltrate China for subversive activities, the United Nations General Assembly passed an illegal resolution on December 10, 1954, falsely accusing China of sentencing eleven American spies as a violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This can only greatly damage the moral standing of the United Nations in the eyes of the world's people, and cannot shake China's solemn position of exercising its sovereignty to sentence American spies. This illegal resolution, whether in its form or content, whether in its entirety or in part, is resolutely opposed by the Chinese government. As for Premier Zhou Enlai's expression of welcome to Mr. Hammarskjöld's visit to China on behalf of the Chinese government on December 17, 1954, that was to welcome him in his capacity as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, according to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, to discuss various issues related to peace and the easing of international tensions with the Chinese government. This cannot have any connection with the illegal resolution of the United Nations.

	When Mr. Hammarskjöld held talks with the Chinese government in Beijing, he also first explained the basis on which he contacted the Chinese government. He explained that the United Nations Secretary-General was "acting in accordance with his statutory responsibilities for the general purposes stated in the Charter," and that in acting for this purpose, he "is not and must never be representative of any one nation, group of nations, or majority of member states recorded in a vote of the Assembly." Mr. Hammarskjöld further emphasized that the legal basis for his visit to Beijing for talks was only the United Nations Charter, not the United Nations General Assembly's condemnation of the Chinese government, so he did not forward the United Nations General Assembly's resolution to the Chinese government for reference. Finally, Mr. Hammarskjöld stated that he believed that "it should not be opposed to the independent procedures of the Chinese courts," and that he had not "for a moment doubted or questioned" China's "sovereignty of sentencing."

	It is very clear that the Chinese government and Mr. Hammarskjöld had a common understanding of the basis on which they contacted each other. If Mr. Hammarskjöld had been acting according to the will of the U.S. government at that time, with the aim of putting pressure on the Chinese government, then it can be said with certainty that such contact would never have been established, let alone maintained.

	The Chinese government resolutely opposes the illegal resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, but has not refused to discuss the American spy case and issues related to the American spy case with Mr. Hammarskjöld. On the contrary, in order to safeguard the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and in order to ensure that Mr. Hammarskjöld had more than just one-sided and untrue materials provided by the United States, the Chinese government considered it necessary to draw Mr. Hammarskjöld's attention to the U.S. espionage activities against China and the basic facts related to the Arnold and Donnely spy cases. The Chinese government pointed out that since July 1950, the United States had conducted many espionage activities against China by invading Chinese airspace with aircraft and air-dropping special agents. The Arnold and Donnely spy cases were only two prominent examples. Full evidence and material evidence show that although Arnold and the other eleven and Donnely and the other two nominally belonged to the forces commanded by the United Nations Command, they were not actually carrying out the United Nations Command's combat missions in Korea, but were taking advantage of the Korean War to infiltrate China for espionage activities. Therefore, these thirteen American spies captured in China were not prisoners of war in the Korean War at all, but criminals who violated Chinese sovereignty and carried out subversive activities against China. If the issue of prisoners of war in the Korean War is to be mentioned, then it is the United States and the United Nations Command that violated the Korean Armistice Agreement. The U.S. government condoned the Rhee Syngman clique's blatant violation of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war and forcibly detained more than 27,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in June 1953. In January 1954, the United Nations Command disregarded the decision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission of Korea and seized more than 21,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and incorporated them into the armies of Rhee Syngman and Chiang Kai-shek. These cases have not yet been resolved. The Chinese people and the Korean people will not give up until the United States and the United Nations Command provide an explanation.

	U.S. espionage activities against China have aroused great indignation among the Chinese people. Mr. Hammarskjöld also acknowledged that the American spy case in China "aroused strong emotional reactions" when he met with the Chinese government. However, the Chinese government still expressed to Mr. Hammarskjöld that, in order to ease the tense relations between China and the United States, it was willing to consider taking measures to reduce sentences and release the criminal American airmen early, in accordance with its consistent lenient policy and Chinese legal procedures. In May 1955, after Mr. Menon of India came to Beijing to exchange views with the Chinese government on the international situation, the Chinese government released the four American airmen, including Fischer, who had committed the crime of invading Chinese airspace, on May 31, 1955, as an active contribution to easing international tensions. On August 1, 1955, before the Chinese and American ambassadors held talks, the Chinese government released the eleven American airmen, including Arnold, who had committed espionage crimes, in order to create a favorable atmosphere for the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks. As the Chinese government has repeatedly emphasized to Mr. Hammarskjöld, these actions taken by the Chinese government on its own initiative based on its sovereignty have nothing to do with the illegal resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly or with any report to the United Nations General Assembly. In fact, any attempt to use pressure to force the Chinese government to abandon its sovereignty has proven to be and will continue to prove to be futile.

	The Chinese government's handling of the criminal American airmen vividly illustrates the attitude that China has consistently adopted in international affairs over the past six years. This attitude is very clear and simple: if you are friendly to China, China always responds with greater friendliness; if you consult with China, China is the most reasonable; if you attempt to bully and invade China, China will definitely resist, and will resist to the end. If Dulles's speech on October 10 shows that, after the Korean War, the Geneva Conference, the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks, etc., he still has not understood China's attitude, then we hope that he will realize this as soon as possible.

### 不能容许杜勒斯歪曲事实

    不能容许杜勒斯歪曲事实
    美国国务卿杜勒斯十月十日的演说提到了十五名美国飞行人员的问题。杜勒斯对这个问题极尽歪曲，这是不能让它含混过去的。
    杜勒斯提到的这十五个人就是侵犯中国领空的费席尔等四名美国飞行人员和侵入中国进行间谍活动的阿诺德等十一名美国飞行人员。如果杜勒斯有自知之明，他应该知道，这种使美国很不体面的事，他最好不提。但是，杜勒斯却根据要说谎就说大谎的原则，把中国对这十五名美国飞行人员的判处说成是“违反朝鲜停战协定”和“严重的挑衅”，又把这十五名美国飞行人员的释放说成是“依靠联合国施加道义压力”的结果。
    这里，人们不能不联想到九月十二日联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生所发表的关于他同中华人民共和国政府进行接触的特别报告。这一特别报告在许多方面是不够全面、不够客观的，特别是它站在联合国中被操纵的多数国家的立场，把违反中国法律的美国飞行人员同一九五四年十二月十日联合国大会第九届会议所通过的非法决议联系起来。哈马舍尔德先生在他的特别报告中根本不提中国政府屡次向他说明的立场，而只是同报告一起发表了以下的所谓“背景材料”：“在北京会谈和以后的一切联系中，中华人民共和国一贯保持着以前曾屡次公开宣布的对事实的态度。周恩来先生说：四名和十一名飞行人员的释放，是中国政府根据自己的主权，主动采取的行动，同联合国的决议无关，它是按照中国的政策和法律程序并出于和缓紧张局势的愿望而采取的行动。”哈马舍尔德先生的特别报告成为联合国的正式文件，而他发表的所谓“背景材料”却遭到西方国家新闻界的封锁。正是这种极不公正的情况使杜勒斯获得了有利的条件来歪曲事实，并且强调所谓“联合国的道义压力”。
    但是，事实的真象是封锁不住的，更不能容许任何歪曲。
    阿诺德等十一名和唐奈等两名美国间谍侵入中国进行颠覆活动，是证据确凿、无可否认的事实。判处在中国境内捕获的美国间谍完全是中国的主权和内政，联合国根据它的宪章根本无权过问。联合国大会不去谴责美国违反联合国宪章派遣间谍侵入中国进行颠覆活动，反而在一九五四年十二月十日通过非法决议，诬蔑中国判处十一名美国间谍为违反朝鲜停战协定。这只能使联合国在世界人民眼中的道义地位大大受到损害，而丝毫不能动摇中国行使自己的主权判处美国间谍的严正立场。这一非法决议，不论是它的形式或是内容，不论是它的全部或是一部分，都是中国政府坚决反对的。至于一九五四年十二月十七日周恩来总理代表中国政府表示欢迎哈马舍尔德先生来中国访问，那是欢迎他以联合国秘书长的身份，根据联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，来同中国政府商谈有关和平和和缓国际紧张局势的各项问题。这同联合国的非法决议不能有任何关系。
    哈马舍尔德先生在北京同中国政府进行会谈时，也首先说明了他同中国政府进行接触所依据的基础。他说明了联合国秘书长是“为了宪章所述的总的宗旨，根据他的法定责任而行动的”，在为此目的而行动时，他“不是、也绝不允许是代表任何一个国家、一组国家或者大会的一次表决所记录的一批占多数的会员国家”。哈马舍尔德先生又强调，他来北京进行会谈的法律基础只是联合国宪章，而不是联合国大会决议中对中国政府的谴责，因此他并没有把联合国大会的决议转送中国政府参考。最后，哈马舍尔德先生声明，他认为“不应该同中国法院的独立程序相抗衡”，而且他也没有“一刻怀疑过或者怀疑着”中国的“判处的主权”。
    很显然，中国政府和哈马舍尔德先生对于彼此接触所依据的基础，是曾经有共同的认识的。如果当时哈马舍尔德先生是按照美国政府的意志，抱着对中国政府施加压力的目的，来同中国政府接触，那末，可以肯定地说，这种接触绝对不会建立起来，更谈不到继续维持下去。
    中国政府坚决反对联合国大会的非法决议，但是并没有因而拒绝同哈马舍尔德先生商谈美国间谍案和同美国间谍案有关的问题。相反地，为了维护联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，为了使哈马舍尔德先生所掌握的不只是美国提供的片面的和不真实的材料，中国政府认为有必要提请哈马舍尔德先生注意美国对中国进行间谍活动的情况和有关阿诺德和唐奈两起间谍案的基本事实。中国政府指出，自从一九五○年七月，美国曾以飞机侵入中国领空和空投特务的方式，对中国进行了许多次间谍活动，阿诺德和唐奈两起间谍案只是其中的两个显著的例子而已。充分的人证和物证说明，阿诺德等十一人和唐奈等二人，虽然名义上属于联合国军所指挥的部队，但是实际上并不是执行联合国军在朝鲜的作战任务，而是利用朝鲜战争的机会，侵入中国进行间谍活动。因此，这十三名在中国境内捕获的美国间谍，根本不是朝鲜战争中的战俘，而是侵犯中国主权、对中国进行颠覆活动的罪犯。如果要提到朝鲜战争中的战俘问题，那末，违反朝鲜停战协定的正是美国和联合国军方面。美国政府纵容李承晚集团公然破坏关于遣返战俘的协定，在一九五三年六月强迫扣留二万七千余名朝中被俘人员。在一九五四年一月，联合国军又不顾朝鲜中立国遣返委员会的决定，劫夺二万一千余名朝中被俘人员，编入李承晚和蒋介石的军队。这些案件至今尚未解决。美国和联合国军方面不作出交代，中国人民和朝鲜人民决不罢休。
    美国对中国进行间谍活动，引起了中国人民极大的愤慨。哈马舍尔德先生在同中国政府会谈时，也承认美国间谍案在中国“引起了强烈的感情上的反应”。但是，中国政府仍然向哈马舍尔德先生表示，为了和缓中美之间的紧张关系，愿意根据一贯的宽大政策和中国的法律程序，考虑对犯罪的美国飞行人员采取减刑和提前释放的措施。一九五五年五月，印度的梅农先生来北京同中国政府就国际形势交换了意见以后，中国政府在一九五五年五月三十一日释放了犯有侵入中国领空罪的费席尔等四名美国飞行人员，作为对和缓国际紧张局势的主动贡献。一九五五年八月一日，在中美两国大使举行会谈以前，中国政府又释放了犯有间谍罪的阿诺德等十一名美国飞行人员，以便为中美大使级会谈创造有利的气氛。正如中国政府向哈马舍尔德先生所一再着重指出的，中国政府根据自己的主权主动采取的这些行动，同联合国大会的非法决议或者同对联合国大会的任何报告都毫无关系。事实上，任何以压力来使中国政府放弃主权的企图，都已经证明是、并将继续证明是徒劳的。
    中国政府对犯罪的美国飞行人员的处理经过，生动地说明了六年来中国在国际事务中一贯采取的态度。这个态度是非常明确、简单的：如果对中国友好，中国总是以更大的友好来回答；如果同中国协商，中国是最讲理的；如果企图欺侮和侵犯中国，中国一定抵抗，而且会抵抗到底。假如杜勒斯十月十日的演说表明，经过了朝鲜战争、日内瓦会议、中美大使级会谈等等之后，他仍然没有体会到中国的这一态度，那末我们希望他及早地体会到这一点。
