    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 5th (TASS): Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, sent a telegram on the 4th to the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, congratulating him on the entry into force of the Treaty on Relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic.

    In the telegram, Bulganin said: Due to the ratification by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, the Treaty on Relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic has legal effect. Therefore, relations between our two countries now have a new and solid foundation, which is in line with the fundamental interests of the German and Soviet peoples.

    There is no doubt that this treaty will have a decisive impact on the further development of close cooperation and friendly relations between our two countries, based on equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.

    We are also convinced that the joint efforts of our two countries to promote the consolidation of peace and security in Europe are a major contribution to the historic cause of reunifying Germany into a peace-loving and democratic state.
