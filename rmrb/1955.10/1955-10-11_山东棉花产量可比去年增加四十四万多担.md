Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, October 10th: Shandong Province is experiencing a bumper cotton harvest this year. According to preliminary estimates from the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture, the unit area yield of cotton in the province will exceed the original plan by about 5%, and the total output is expected to increase by more than 442,800 dan of ginned cotton compared to last year. The cotton matured earlier, and the quality is also very good. Currently, in the cotton-producing areas, generally 70% to 80% of the cotton has been picked.

This year, agricultural producers' cooperatives in the cotton-producing areas of Shandong Province have developed rapidly. More than 36,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives in various cotton-producing areas have led mutual aid teams and individual farmers to overfulfill the province's plan for expanding cotton planting. The cotton planting area of these agricultural producers' cooperatives reached more than 3 million mu, accounting for more than 30% of the province's total cotton planting area.

In order to increase the unit area yield of cotton, more than 220 newly built district agricultural technology extension stations in the cotton-producing areas this year have taken agricultural producers' cooperatives as their base and led the broad masses of farmers to launch extensive cotton planting technology reform movements. The planting area of improved cotton varieties in the province has reached more than 8 million mu, and many old cotton-producing areas have basically popularized improved varieties. At the same time, as a result of promoting appropriate close planting, the number of cotton plants per mu in the province has increased by 500 to 1,000 plants compared to last year. In the old cotton-producing areas of Dezhou, Huimin, and other regions, the number of cotton plants per mu has generally reached about 3,500 to 4,500 plants; Heze region, which was accustomed to sparse planting in the past, has also generally increased from about 1,500 plants per mu last year to more than 2,500 plants this year. The close planting alone can increase the yield of ginned cotton by 2 to 5 jin per mu. In addition, the cotton field management work such as topping and pruning in various cotton-producing areas has also been further improved compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, October 6th: Shandong Province has overfulfilled its September new cotton purchase plan, and the amount purchased has increased more than four and a half times compared to the same period last year. As of the end of September, more than 168,000 dan of new cotton had been shipped to cotton textile factories in Qingdao, Jinan, Northeast China, and other places.

    山东棉花产量可比去年增加四十四万多担
    新华社济南十日电　山东省今年棉花丰收。据山东省农业厅初步估计，全省棉花单位面积产量将超过原订计划百分之五左右，总产量可比去年增加皮棉四十四万二千八百多担。棉花成熟较早，质量也很好。现在各产棉区一般已有百分之七十到八十的棉花被采摘下来。
    今年山东省各产棉区农业生产合作社的发展很快，各产棉区的三万六千多个农业生产合作社带动互助组和单干农民，超额完成全省扩大植棉的计划。这些农业生产合作社的植棉面积共达三百多万亩，占全省植棉总面积百分之三十以上。
    为了提高棉花的单位面积产量，各产棉区今年新建的二百二十多处区农业技术推广站，都以农业生产合作社为基点，带动广大农民，展开了广泛的植棉技术改革运动。全省棉花良种的种植面积已达到八百万亩以上，许多老棉区已基本上普及良种。同时，推行适当密植的结果，全省棉田每亩都比去年增加了五百株到一千株。老棉区德州、惠民等专区每亩棉田普遍达到三千五百株到四千五百株左右；过去习惯稀植的菏泽专区也普遍由去年的每亩一千五百株左右增加到今年的二千五百多株。仅密植一项，每亩就可增产皮棉二斤到五斤。此外，各产棉区摘心整枝等棉田管理工作也比去年进一步提高。
    新华社济南六日电　山东省九月份新棉收购计划已超额完成，收购的数量比去年同期增加四倍半以上。到九月底止，运往青岛、济南、东北等地的棉纺织厂的新棉已有十六万八千多担。
