The Sino-American talks have been going on for nearly six weeks since an agreement was reached on the first item on the agenda – the repatriation of civilians from both sides. When the Chinese side initially entered the discussion of the second item on the agenda, it made a proposal at the fifteenth meeting on September 14th, suggesting that the discussion and resolution of the embargo issue and the preparation for holding higher-level Sino-American talks should be addressed under this item on the agenda. World opinion generally believes that the two issues raised by the Chinese side are reasonable and practical. A swift and serious discussion of these two issues and the making of corresponding concrete arrangements will help to improve relations between China and the United States and further ease the tensions in the Far East and the world.

However, the U.S. side has consistently adopted an attitude of obstruction and procrastination in discussing the relevant practical issues in the second item on the agenda over the past six weeks. As early as the fifteenth meeting, the U.S. delegation violated the agreement on news releases at the meeting and disseminated a written statement to the press after the meeting, unilaterally revealing the issues of contention within the meeting, and put forward the so-called "it is too early to discuss the second item on the agenda before the agreement is implemented" argument. This argument has not only been refuted by the Chinese delegation in a public statement on September 19th, but it has also been criticized by various sectors of world opinion. Thus, the press communiqué issued after the sixteenth meeting on September 20th only mentioned that the Chinese and American ambassadors had "exchanged views on the second item on the agenda." It seems that only under these circumstances did the U.S. side have no choice but to enter into the discussion of the second item on the agenda.

After the U.S. delegation could no longer obstruct the discussion of the second item on the agenda by publicly issuing unilateral statements, another situation emerged. At this time, Western news agencies and newspaper reporters constantly revealed the content of the talks. For example, recently American news agencies and newspapers reported that U.S. Ambassador Johnson raised the issue of the whereabouts of the so-called "missing American military personnel" and the issue of so-called "renunciation of the use of force" at the meeting during the Korean War.

As everyone knows, Chinese Ambassador Wang Bingnan, at the beginning of the discussion of the second item on the agenda, put forward two issues that should be discussed and resolved under this item on the agenda based on the Chinese side's position, and officially announced them to the press through the Chinese delegation's spokesman after both sides agreed. The U.S. side has not announced to the press what proposals they believe should be discussed under the second item on the agenda, but American news agencies and newspapers have continuously made various disclosures, even saying that these disclosures came from "sources on the Chinese side." Here, one cannot help but ask: Why should the issues raised by the U.S. ambassador at the meeting be disclosed by the Chinese side and then reported by American newspapers?

One typical example of creating something out of nothing and confusing the atmosphere of the talks is a dispatch by an unsigned "'New York Times' Special Correspondent" published in the "New York Times" on October 15th under the dateline "Geneva, October 14th." This dispatch, after citing the comments of the Observer in the Beijing People's Daily on October 12th and 13th based on "a special dispatch received by the U.S. Consulate General in Geneva from Hong Kong," said: "In fact, the news about Mr. Johnson raising the issue of prisoners of war here came from the Chinese side rather than the American side." However, the newspaper did not mention the specific channels through which this news came from the Chinese side, indicating that this had no factual basis.

Not only that, this newspaper, which is close to the U.S. State Department, also said: "A representative of the New China News Agency said that Ambassador Wang had told Mr. Johnson that he could not discuss the issue of renouncing the use of force in the Far East until issues such as the Seventh Fleet withdrawing from the Taiwan Strait and the lifting of the trade embargo against Communist China are resolved." The "New York Times" then contradictorily said: "However, other sources indicate that this account of the meeting is inaccurate." Reading this, people realize that this "'New York Times' Special Correspondent" also has "other sources" besides the so-called "Chinese sources" or "representatives of the New China News Agency." What this "other source" is, this gentleman did not make a clear explanation. But one cannot help but suspect whether this "other source" truly reflects the truth of the talks and whether it is beneficial to the progress of the talks.

What is the truth? It is necessary to state here that the reporter dispatched by the New China News Agency to Geneva to cover the Sino-American talks has not only never had any conversations with this "'New York Times' Special Correspondent," but since the end of August until now, during the various meetings of the Sino-American talks, there has never been a "New York Times" reporter present among the group of international journalists covering the meeting news in the corridor outside the conference room of the League of Nations Building. Therefore, the identity of the author of this "New York Times" dispatch on October 15th has become a mystery. Judging from the content of this dispatch, there seems to be no doubt that this "'New York Times' Special Correspondent" has close ties with the U.S. Consulate General in Geneva and also has reliable U.S. sources. According to an American reporter here, this dispatch may not have been written by any journalist, and this view seems to be completely justified.

In any case, as far as this dispatch published in the "New York Times" is concerned, the position of this author—whether a professional journalist or a non-professional journalist—is clear: not only has he adopted an unfriendly attitude that is not helpful to the progress of the talks and not beneficial to improving relations between China and the United States, but his approximately one hundred lines of text also show his own disloyalty to the facts and behavior that violates journalistic ethics.

    评中美会谈
    新华社特派记者　陈适五
    中美会谈自从就第一项议程——双方平民回国问题达成协议以来，已经快六个星期了。中国方面在一开始进入第二项议程的讨论时，就在九月十四日的第十五次会议上提出了建议，认为在这项议程下目前应该讨论和解决禁运问题和准备举行高一级的中美会谈问题。世界舆论普遍地认为中国方面所提出的这两个问题是合理的和切合实际的。迅速地和认真地讨论这两个问题并且作出相应的具体安排，将有助于改进中美两国间的关系和进一步缓和远东以及世界的紧张局势。
    但是，美国方面在过去近六周来，却一直采取了阻挠和拖延讨论第二项议程中有关的实际问题的态度。还在第十五次会议时，美国代表团就违反会上关于新闻公布的协议，在会后向新闻界散发书面声明，片面地透露了会内争执的问题，提出所谓“在协议未实施前讨论第二项议程为时尚早”的说法。这种说法不仅已由中国代表团在九月十九日的公开声明中加以驳斥，而且它也受到各国舆论界的非议。这样，九月二十日第十六次会议后发布的会议公报中才提到了中美两国大使已“就第二项议程问题交换意见”。看来只是在这种情况下美国方面才不得不进入第二项议程的讨论。
    在美国代表团方面用公开发表片面声明的办法已无法再阻挠会谈进行关于第二项议程的讨论之后，接着就出现了另外一种情形，这时候，西方通讯社和报纸记者就不断地透露出来会谈的内容。例如，近来美国通讯社和报纸报道，美国大使约翰逊在会上提出了在朝鲜战争中所谓“失踪的美国军事人员的下落”问题和所谓“放弃使用武力”问题。
    大家知道，中国方面王炳南大使在会谈讨论第二项议程一开始时，即根据中国方面的立场提出在这一项议程下应该讨论和解决的两个问题，并且经双方同意后由中国代表团发言人向报界正式宣布。美国方面迄未向报界宣布过它们认为在第二项议程下应该讨论那些问题的建议，但美国通讯社和报纸却又不断作出种种的透露，甚至说成这类透露是来自“中国方面人士”的消息。在这里人们不禁要问：美国大使在会上提出的问题为什么要由中国方面来透露再由美国报纸加以报道呢？
    这种无中生有的混淆会谈气氛的典型例子之一，便是十月十五日“纽约时报”在“日内瓦十月十四日电”的电头下所刊载的不署名的“‘纽约时报’”特派记者”的一篇通讯，这篇通讯在根据“此间（日内瓦）美国总领事馆收到来自香港方面的专电”引述了北京人民日报十月十二、十三两日观察家的评论之后说：“事实上，关于约翰逊先生在此间提出俘虏问题的消息，乃是来自中国方面而不是来自美国方面。”但是，该报却又不提这个消息如何来自中国方面的具体途径，可见这是没有事实根据的。
    不仅如此，这家同美国国务院接近的报纸又说：“一位新华通讯社的代表说，王大使曾告诉约翰逊先生，除非等到例如第七舰队从台湾海峡撤走以及对共产党中国贸易禁运取消这些问题解决之后，他不能讨论在远东放弃使用武力的问题。”“纽约时报”接着却又自相矛盾地说：“可是其他的来源却表示这种对会议的叙述是不确实的。”读到这里人们才明白，原来这位“‘纽约时报’特派记者”先生除了所谓“中国方面人士”或者“新华通讯社的代表”的消息来源之外，还有“其他消息来源”。这个“其他消息来源”是什么，这位先生并没有作明确的交代。但是这个“其他消息来源”是否真正反映了会谈的真象和是否对会谈的进展有所裨益，人们却不能不感到怀疑。
    事实是什么呢？在这里必需说明，新华通讯社派在此间采访中美会谈的记者，不但没有同这位“‘纽约时报’特派记者”先生做过任何谈话，而且自八月下旬直到现在，在中美会谈历次开会时，在国联大厦会议室外走廊上采访会议新闻的一群各国新闻记者中，一直没有“纽约时报”的记者在场。因此，十月十五日“纽约时报”这篇通讯的作者究竟是谁就成了一个疑案。从这篇通讯的内容看来，这位“‘纽约时报’特派记者”先生是与美国驻日内瓦总领事馆既有密切联系，而且又有可靠的美国方面消息来源似乎是没有疑问的了。据这里的一位美国记者说，这篇通讯也许并非出于任何新闻记者之手，看来这种说法是完全有理由的。
    无论如何，就登载在“纽约时报”上的这篇通讯而言，这位作者——无论是职业记者也罢，非职业记者也罢——的立场是明白的，这就是：他不仅采取了对会谈进展没有帮助的、对改进中美两国间关系没有好处的不友好态度，而且他的约一百行的通讯文字还表明了他自己的不忠实于事实的有背于新闻道德的行为。
