Egypt's struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and resist colonialist pressures is gaining strong support from the people of all countries. Its increasingly active role in international affairs has attracted close attention from the world public. This is not accidental. Because Egypt is a major country in the Near East and Middle East Arab countries, located at the junction of Asia, Europe and Africa, it has always occupied an important position in the imperialist plans to invade the Middle East and Near East. The actions of the Egyptian government and people to safeguard their national interests and national peace and security have a major impact on the struggle of the Middle East, Near East Arab countries, and North African people for freedom and national independence.

Ancient Egypt was once one of the world's great powers. It had a brilliant ancient culture. The Egyptian people are hardworking, brave, and intelligent people. They made great contributions to human civilization in mathematics, astronomy, architecture, and art. However, in the history of recent centuries, the Egyptian people have gone through a difficult road. In the early sixteenth century, Egypt was conquered by the Turks. At the end of the eighteenth century, it was ravaged by Napoleon's army. From the end of the nineteenth century, British troops occupied Egypt. The oppression of foreign invaders and endless wars damaged Egypt's strength. This country, once known as the granary of the Mediterranean, gradually became a backward colonial country dependent on food imports.

Economically, Egypt is an agricultural country. But the long-term colonial oppression resulted in the one-sided development of the agricultural economy. Britain turned Egypt into a country specializing in the production of cotton to guarantee the raw materials for the British textile industry. In Egypt, cotton fields account for almost one-third of the cultivated land area. Nearly half of the total agricultural income relies on cotton. Cotton is the main export item of the country, with almost nine-tenths of the cotton being exported abroad. In the past, large British companies monopolized the export of Egyptian cotton at low prices. After the war, the United States' growing influence in the Middle East and Near East is using the cotton trade in the international market as a "tool for blackmailing Egypt and exerting political pressure."

Long-term colonial oppression has also had serious consequences for the development of Egyptian industry. Egypt's industry mainly carries out preliminary processing of agricultural products. Most enterprises are semi-handicraft and small handicraft factories. Although Egypt is one of the world's largest cotton-producing countries, it does not have a developed textile industry. Until now, cotton fabrics are still mainly imported from abroad. Only a small amount of the cotton produced in Egypt is processed domestically. All of Egypt's industries, including oil extraction, oil refining, textiles, and sugar refining, were until recently controlled by foreign capital, mainly British capital.

Politically, Egypt has long been bound by enslaving political treaties, and its territory has been occupied by foreign troops.

The imperialist's endless oppression and exploitation of Egypt are incompatible with the national interests of the Egyptian people, and have aroused the firm resistance of the Egyptian people. In the long period of nearly a hundred years, the Egyptian people have carried out heroic and selfless struggles to win their freedom and national independence. Egypt has repeatedly witnessed uprisings against colonialists. Although imperialism has treated the Egyptian people with the most brutal means, the Egyptian people have never succumbed to the invaders.

The development of the Egyptian people's strength has forced imperialism to consider changing its methods of aggression against Egypt. The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty signed in London in 1936 was still an unequal and aggressive treaty in essence, stipulating that British troops would continue to be stationed on Egyptian territory, but the treaty had to acknowledge Egypt's independence in words. The Egyptian people continued to fight for the abolition of this treaty. Especially after the Second World War, the Egyptian people's movement for national independence rose even higher. In October 1951, the Egyptian parliament approved the decree to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty under the firm demand of the Egyptian people. In October 1954, Egypt and Britain signed an agreement on the British military base in the Suez Canal Zone, stipulating that British occupying forces would completely withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone within twenty months.

The main pillar of imperialism in Egypt was the large landlord class, including the royal family. In the situation of the rising national liberation movement, the struggle of millions of Egyptian peasants for land also developed. In Egypt, the anti-imperialist movement is closely intertwined with the anti-feudal and anti-monarchical movements. This high morale of the people helped the success of the coup d'état launched by the young officers' organization in July 1952 to overthrow the monarchy. This coup ended the rule of King Farouk, confiscated the large estates of the palace clique, abolished social ranks and aristocratic titles, and purged state institutions. The "Revolutionary Guidance Committee" composed of young officers later declared Egypt a republic.

Among the measures taken by the new Egyptian government in recent years, the land system reform law promulgated in September 1952 was supported by the Egyptian people at that time. In Egypt, the land relationship issue is a sharp one. According to the data in 1950, 94 percent of the country's farmers were landless or had little land. This land system reform law stipulates that the land of landlords exceeding 84 hectares will be confiscated with high-price compensation, and the land will be distributed to farmers with installment payments, and the rent will be restricted and reduced to a certain extent. Due to the limitations of this law itself and the resistance of the large landlords, the reform of the land system is not thorough. However, despite this, it is still a progress, and it has powerfully hit the economic and political position of the feudal landlord class in the country. In addition, the Egyptian government has also formulated a program to increase agricultural production, planning to build water conservancy and irrigation projects on the Nile River to expand the cultivated area by two million acres in ten years.

In terms of developing industry, the Egyptian government has established a Ministry of Industrial Production Affairs, responsible for planning industrial production throughout the country. The plan to build power plants has begun. Among the enterprises that have been decided to be built are fertilizer plants, steel plants, paper mills, hemp spinning mills, tire factories, and sugar refineries. At the same time, the Egyptian government is working hard to develop foreign trade and take measures to overcome rising prices.

Before 1952, Egypt's foreign trade often showed a deficit. In recent years, thanks to the Egyptian government's efforts to free the economy from foreign control and find new markets, the situation of foreign trade has begun to improve. The expansion and establishment of trade relations with the Soviet Union, China and other people's democratic countries is of great significance to the development of the Egyptian economy. Because, in these countries, Egypt can find stable and broad markets for its main export commodities such as cotton and other commodities, and these countries can guarantee to supply Egypt with all kinds of industrial equipment and other commodities that it urgently needs. In August this year, Egypt signed a trade agreement with China. China has purchased 91,000 bales of Egyptian cotton successively, while Egypt has imported 60,000 tons of steel from China. China's large-scale purchase of Egyptian cotton has in fact had a favorable impact on Egypt's financial situation. Egypt's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union has been expanding in recent years. In 1952-1953, the Soviet Union ranked fourth among Egypt's cotton exporting countries. The Soviet Union can supply Egypt with large quantities of wheat, flour, gasoline, coal, agricultural machinery and other industrial equipment that it needs. The trade in which Egypt exchanges cotton and rice for Czechoslovakian munitions, recently announced by Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser, will help consolidate and strengthen Egypt's defense forces.

The Egyptian government's foreign policy aimed at supporting peace and strengthening international cooperation has been universally supported by the Egyptian people. Prime Minister Nasser announced the Egyptian government's foreign policy at a press conference with foreign reporters last July. He said that Egypt "is willing to live in peace with all countries and is ready to cooperate with all those who truly want to cooperate." This year, Egypt actively participated in the Asian-African Conference. Prime Minister Nasser's speech at the meeting expressed firm opposition to colonialism, believing that colonialism is the root cause of world instability. Nasser advocated that all countries in the world should respect each other's sovereignty and independence, and that every country should have the right to freely choose its political and economic system.

Egypt refuses to participate in the military aggression groups pieced together by Western countries in the Middle East and Near East regions. Prime Minister Nasser said: "Egypt opposes joining foreign military treaties." The Egyptian people are increasingly aware that participating in such groups is detrimental to their national independence and sovereignty. The Egyptian people's struggle against participating in the military groups of Western countries has enhanced Egypt's prestige in the international community. This is evidenced by the successive visits of Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Yugoslav President Tito, and Indonesian President Sukarno to Egypt this year. Prime Minister Nasser of Egypt will soon visit the Soviet Union at the invitation, which will further strengthen Egypt's international status.

The facts clearly show that the road Egypt has traveled in the past and its current actual situation in international affairs have undergone significant changes. The Egyptian people's struggle for independence and freedom is making progress. Egypt has gradually changed from a colonial country with no rights to a country that plays an active role in international affairs. Needless to say, this is inseparable from its implementation of an independent and autonomous policy, support for peace, and efforts to strengthen international cooperation. Egypt will encounter difficulties on its road to progress, especially the imperialists will exert pressure on it, and domestic enemies will also hinder it. However, the Egyptian people have rich experience in long-term struggle and a firm will, and their desire for freedom and national independence will surely be realized.

    埃及在前进的道路上
    杜波
    埃及政府和人民为维护国家主权、反对殖民主义压力的斗争，正获得各国人民的有力支持。它在国际事务中日益增长的积极作用，已引起了世界公众的密切注意。这不是偶然的。因为，埃及在近东和中东阿拉伯国家中是一个大国，位于欧亚非三洲的衔接地带，在帝国主义侵略中东和近东的计划中，它始终占着重要的地位。埃及政府和人民维护自己民族利益和国家和平安全的行动，对于中东、近东阿拉伯国家以及北非人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争，都具有重大的影响。
    埃及古代曾是世界的强国之一。它有着灿烂的古代文化。埃及人民是勤劳、勇敢和智慧的人民。他们在数学、天文学、建筑学和艺术方面，对人类文明作了伟大的贡献。但是，在近几个世纪的历史中，埃及人民却历尽了艰难的道路。十六世纪初期埃及被土耳其人征服。十八世纪末遭受过法国拿破仑军队的蹂躏。从十九世纪末起，英国军队占领了埃及。外国侵略者的压迫和无休止的战争，毁伤了埃及的力量。这个曾经号称是地中海粮仓的国家，逐渐变成了依赖粮食进口的落后的殖民地国家。
    埃及在经济方面是个农业国家。但长期遭受殖民压迫的后果，是农业经济的片面发展。英国把埃及变成了专门生产棉花的国家，来保证英国纺织工业的原料。在埃及，棉田占耕地面积几乎三分之一。农业总收入的将近一半是依靠棉花。棉花是国家出口的主要项目，差不多有十分之九的棉花要输往国外。过去，英国的大公司用低贱的价格垄断了埃及棉花的出口。战后，美国在中东和近东的势力增长，正利用国际市场上的棉花贸易来作为“对埃及进行讹诈和作为政治压力的工具”。
    长期的殖民压迫，同样对埃及工业的发展产生了严重的后果。埃及的工业，主要是进行农产品初步加工。大多数企业是半手工业和小手工业工厂。埃及虽然是世界生产棉花最多的国家之一，但它并没有发达的纺织工业。直到现在，棉织品还主要靠国外输入。埃及出产的棉花，只有很少量是在国内加工的。埃及的所有工业，包括采油、炼油、纺织和制糖工业，不久以前还是为外国资本，主要是为英国资本所控制。
    在政治上，埃及长期遭受奴役性的政治条约的束缚，它的领土遭受外国军队的占领。
    帝国主义对埃及无止境的压迫和剥削，是和埃及人民的民族利益不相容的，引起了埃及人民的坚决反抗。在近百年来的长时期中，埃及人民为争取自己的自由和民族独立，进行了英勇的忘我斗争。埃及屡次发生反对殖民主义者的起义。虽然帝国主义用最残暴的手段来对待埃及人民，但埃及人民从来没有在侵略者的面前屈服过。
    埃及人民力量的发展，迫使帝国主义不得不考虑改变对埃及的侵略方式。一九三六年在伦敦签订的英埃条约，在实质上仍旧是不平等的侵略条约，规定英国军队继续驻扎在埃及领土上，但条约在字面上不得不承认埃及的独立。埃及人民为废除这个条约继续进行斗争。特别是在第二次世界大战后，埃及人民争取民族独立运动更形高涨。一九五一年十月，埃及议会在埃及人民坚决要求下批准了废除英埃条约的法令。一九五四年十月，埃及同英国又签订关于苏彝士运河区英国军事基地的协定，规定在二十个月内完全撤出苏彝士运河区的英国占领军。
    帝国主义在埃及的主要支柱，是包括王室在内的大地主阶级。在民族解放运动高涨的形势下，埃及千百万农民争取土地的斗争也有了发展。在埃及，反帝国主义同反封建主义和反君主政权的运动是密切交织在一起的。人民群众这种高涨的情绪，有助于一九五二年七月青年军官组织政变推翻君主制的成功。这个政变，结束了国王法鲁克的统治，没收了宫廷集团的大地产，废除了社会等级和贵族称号，清洗了国家机构。青年军官组成的“革命指导委员会”后来宣布埃及为共和国。
    在埃及新政府近几年来所采取的措施中，一九五二年九月颁布的土地制度改革法，得到了当时埃及人民的支持。在埃及，土地关系问题是个尖锐的问题。据一九五零年的材料，全国农民中，百分之九十四属于无地或少地的农民。这个土地制度改革法规定，用高价补偿的办法没收超过八十四公顷的地主土地，而用分期收费的办法把土地分配给农民，并对地租作了一定程度的限制和减低。由于这个法律本身的限制和大地主的反抗，土地制度的改革还不是彻底的。但是，尽管这样，它仍然是一个进步，有力地打击了封建大地主阶级在国内的经济地位和政治地位。此外，埃及政府还制定了提高农业生产的纲领，筹划在尼罗河上兴修水利灌溉工程，使耕地面积在十年后扩大二百万英亩。
    在发展工业方面，埃及政府设立了工业生产事务部，负责计划全国范围内的工业生产。建设发电站的计划已着手进行。决定将要建设的企业中，有肥料厂、炼钢厂、造纸厂、麻纺厂、轮胎厂、制糖厂等。同时，埃及政府正努力发展对外贸易，并采取克服物价上涨的措施。
    在一九五二年以前，埃及的对外贸易还经常出现逆差。近几年来，由于埃及政府努力使经济摆脱外国的控制，寻找新的市场，对外贸易的状况开始有了改善。同苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的贸易关系的扩展和建立，对埃及经济的发展具有重大的意义。因为，埃及在这些国家里可以为自己的主要出口品棉花和其他商品找到稳定而广阔的市场，而这些国家能够保证供给埃及所迫切需要的一切种类的工业装备及其他商品。今年八月，埃及同中国签订了贸易协定。中国先后购买了九万一千包埃及棉花，而埃及则从中国输入了六万吨钢材。中国大量购买埃及棉花，事实表明已对埃及的财政状况产生了有利的影响。埃及同苏联的经济合作关系，近几年来正在扩展。在一九五二—一九五三年，苏联占埃及棉花出口国的第四位。苏联能够大量供给埃及所需要的小麦、面粉、汽油、煤、农业机器和其他工业装备。最近埃及总理纳赛尔宣布的埃及以棉花和大米交换捷克斯洛伐克军火的贸易，有助于埃及国防力量的巩固和加强。
    埃及政府旨在支持和平、加强国际合作的对外政策，得到了埃及人民的普遍支持。纳赛尔总理去年七月在外国记者招待会上宣布了埃及政府的对外政策。他说，埃及“愿和一切国家和平共处，准备和一切真正希望合作的人进行合作”。今年，埃及积极地参加了亚非会议。纳赛尔总理在会议上的发言，表示坚决反对殖民主义，认为殖民主义是世界不稳定的根源。纳赛尔主张世界各国都应尊重彼此的主权和独立，每一个国家都应该有权利来自由地选择它的政治和经济制度。
    埃及拒绝参加西方国家在中东和近东地区拼凑的军事侵略集团。纳赛尔总理说过：“埃及反对参加外国的军事条约”。埃及人民越来越清楚地懂得，参加这种集团对他们的民族独立和主权是不利的。埃及人民反对参加西方国家军事集团的斗争，提高了埃及在国际上的声望。印度总理尼赫鲁、南斯拉夫总统铁托、印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在今年相继访问埃及，就证明了这一点。埃及总理纳赛尔不久将应邀访问苏联，更将促使埃及的国际地位进一步加强。
    事实非常清楚地说明，埃及过去所走过的道路和它今天在国际事务上所处的实际状况，已经发生了显著的变化。埃及人民争取独立和自由的斗争正取得进展。埃及已经从一个毫无权利的殖民地国家，逐渐成为在国际事务中起积极作用的国家。不待说，这同它执行独立自主政策，支持和平，以及对加强国际合作所作的努力是分不开的。埃及在它前进的道路上，是还会碰到困难的，特别是帝国主义还会对它施行压力，国内的敌人也还会进行阻挠。但是，埃及人民有着长期斗争的丰富经验和坚定的意志，他们争取自由和民族独立的愿望是一定能够实现的。
