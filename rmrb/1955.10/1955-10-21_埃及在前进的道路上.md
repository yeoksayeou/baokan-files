Egypt's struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and resist colonialist pressures is gaining strong support from the people of all countries. Its increasingly active role in international affairs has attracted close attention from the world public. This is not accidental. Because Egypt is a major country in the Near East and Middle East Arab countries, located at the junction of Asia, Europe and Africa, it has always occupied an important position in the imperialist plans to invade the Middle East and Near East. The actions of the Egyptian government and people to safeguard their national interests and national peace and security have a major impact on the struggle of the Middle East, Near East Arab countries, and North African people for freedom and national independence.

Ancient Egypt was once one of the world's great powers. It had a brilliant ancient culture. The Egyptian people are hardworking, brave, and intelligent people. They made great contributions to human civilization in mathematics, astronomy, architecture, and art. However, in the history of recent centuries, the Egyptian people have gone through a difficult road. In the early sixteenth century, Egypt was conquered by the Turks. At the end of the eighteenth century, it was ravaged by Napoleon's army. From the end of the nineteenth century, British troops occupied Egypt. The oppression of foreign invaders and endless wars damaged Egypt's strength. This country, once known as the granary of the Mediterranean, gradually became a backward colonial country dependent on food imports.

Economically, Egypt is an agricultural country. But the long-term colonial oppression resulted in the one-sided development of the agricultural economy. Britain turned Egypt into a country specializing in the production of cotton to guarantee the raw materials for the British textile industry. In Egypt, cotton fields account for almost one-third of the cultivated land area. Nearly half of the total agricultural income relies on cotton. Cotton is the main export item of the country, with almost nine-tenths of the cotton being exported abroad. In the past, large British companies monopolized the export of Egyptian cotton at low prices. After the war, the United States' growing influence in the Middle East and Near East is using the cotton trade in the international market as a "tool for blackmailing Egypt and exerting political pressure."

Long-term colonial oppression has also had serious consequences for the development of Egyptian industry. Egypt's industry mainly carries out preliminary processing of agricultural products. Most enterprises are semi-handicraft and small handicraft factories. Although Egypt is one of the world's largest cotton-producing countries, it does not have a developed textile industry. Until now, cotton fabrics are still mainly imported from abroad. Only a small amount of the cotton produced in Egypt is processed domestically. All of Egypt's industries, including oil extraction, oil refining, textiles, and sugar refining, were until recently controlled by foreign capital, mainly British capital.

Politically, Egypt has long been bound by enslaving political treaties, and its territory has been occupied by foreign troops.

The imperialist's endless oppression and exploitation of Egypt are incompatible with the national interests of the Egyptian people, and have aroused the firm resistance of the Egyptian people. In the long period of nearly a hundred years, the Egyptian people have carried out heroic and selfless struggles to win their freedom and national independence. Egypt has repeatedly witnessed uprisings against colonialists. Although imperialism has treated the Egyptian people with the most brutal means, the Egyptian people have never succumbed to the invaders.

The development of the Egyptian people's strength has forced imperialism to consider changing its methods of aggression against Egypt. The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty signed in London in 1936 was still an unequal and aggressive treaty in essence, stipulating that British troops would continue to be stationed on Egyptian territory, but the treaty had to acknowledge Egypt's independence in words. The Egyptian people continued to fight for the abolition of this treaty. Especially after the Second World War, the Egyptian people's movement for national independence rose even higher. In October 1951, the Egyptian parliament approved the decree to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty under the firm demand of the Egyptian people. In October 1954, Egypt and Britain signed an agreement on the British military base in the Suez Canal Zone, stipulating that British occupying forces would completely withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone within twenty months.

The main pillar of imperialism in Egypt was the large landlord class, including the royal family. In the situation of the rising national liberation movement, the struggle of millions of Egyptian peasants for land also developed. In Egypt, the anti-imperialist movement is closely intertwined with the anti-feudal and anti-monarchical movements. This high morale of the people helped the success of the coup d'Ã©tat launched by the young officers' organization in July 1952 to overthrow the monarchy. This coup ended the rule of King Farouk, confiscated the large estates of the palace clique, abolished social ranks and aristocratic titles, and purged state institutions. The "Revolutionary Guidance Committee" composed of young officers later declared Egypt a republic.

Among the measures taken by the new Egyptian government in recent years, the land system reform law promulgated in September 1952 was supported by the Egyptian people at that time. In Egypt, the land relationship issue is a sharp one. According to the data in 1950, 94 percent of the country's farmers were landless or had little land. This land system reform law stipulates that the land of landlords exceeding 84 hectares will be confiscated with high-price compensation, and the land will be distributed to farmers with installment payments, and the rent will be restricted and reduced to a certain extent. Due to the limitations of this law itself and the resistance of the large landlords, the reform of the land system is not thorough. However, despite this, it is still a progress, and it has powerfully hit the economic and political position of the feudal landlord class in the country. In addition, the Egyptian government has also formulated a program to increase agricultural production, planning to build water conservancy and irrigation projects on the Nile River to expand the cultivated area by two million acres in ten years.

In terms of developing industry, the Egyptian government has established a Ministry of Industrial Production Affairs, responsible for planning industrial production throughout the country. The plan to build power plants has begun. Among the enterprises that have been decided to be built are fertilizer plants, steel plants, paper mills, hemp spinning mills, tire factories, and sugar refineries. At the same time, the Egyptian government is working hard to develop foreign trade and take measures to overcome rising prices.

Before 1952, Egypt's foreign trade often showed a deficit. In recent years, thanks to the Egyptian government's efforts to free the economy from foreign control and find new markets, the situation of foreign trade has begun to improve. The expansion and establishment of trade relations with the Soviet Union, China and other people's democratic countries is of great significance to the development of the Egyptian economy. Because, in these countries, Egypt can find stable and broad markets for its main export commodities such as cotton and other commodities, and these countries can guarantee to supply Egypt with all kinds of industrial equipment and other commodities that it urgently needs. In August this year, Egypt signed a trade agreement with China. China has purchased 91,000 bales of Egyptian cotton successively, while Egypt has imported 60,000 tons of steel from China. China's large-scale purchase of Egyptian cotton has in fact had a favorable impact on Egypt's financial situation. Egypt's economic cooperation with the Soviet Union has been expanding in recent years. In 1952-1953, the Soviet Union ranked fourth among Egypt's cotton exporting countries. The Soviet Union can supply Egypt with large quantities of wheat, flour, gasoline, coal, agricultural machinery and other industrial equipment that it needs. The trade in which Egypt exchanges cotton and rice for Czechoslovakian munitions, recently announced by Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser, will help consolidate and strengthen Egypt's defense forces.

The Egyptian government's foreign policy aimed at supporting peace and strengthening international cooperation has been universally supported by the Egyptian people. Prime Minister Nasser announced the Egyptian government's foreign policy at a press conference with foreign reporters last July. He said that Egypt "is willing to live in peace with all countries and is ready to cooperate with all those who truly want to cooperate." This year, Egypt actively participated in the Asian-African Conference. Prime Minister Nasser's speech at the meeting expressed firm opposition to colonialism, believing that colonialism is the root cause of world instability. Nasser advocated that all countries in the world should respect each other's sovereignty and independence, and that every country should have the right to freely choose its political and economic system.

Egypt refuses to participate in the military aggression groups pieced together by Western countries in the Middle East and Near East regions. Prime Minister Nasser said: "Egypt opposes joining foreign military treaties." The Egyptian people are increasingly aware that participating in such groups is detrimental to their national independence and sovereignty. The Egyptian people's struggle against participating in the military groups of Western countries has enhanced Egypt's prestige in the international community. This is evidenced by the successive visits of Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Yugoslav President Tito, and Indonesian President Sukarno to Egypt this year. Prime Minister Nasser of Egypt will soon visit the Soviet Union at the invitation, which will further strengthen Egypt's international status.

The facts clearly show that the road Egypt has traveled in the past and its current actual situation in international affairs have undergone significant changes. The Egyptian people's struggle for independence and freedom is making progress. Egypt has gradually changed from a colonial country with no rights to a country that plays an active role in international affairs. Needless to say, this is inseparable from its implementation of an independent and autonomous policy, support for peace, and efforts to strengthen international cooperation. Egypt will encounter difficulties on its road to progress, especially the imperialists will exert pressure on it, and domestic enemies will also hinder it. However, the Egyptian people have rich experience in long-term struggle and a firm will, and their desire for freedom and national independence will surely be realized.
