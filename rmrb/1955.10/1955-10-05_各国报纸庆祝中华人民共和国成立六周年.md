Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Newspapers in various countries have published editorials or special articles celebrating the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The thirty-ninth issue of the newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy," the organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, published in Bucharest on September 30, published an editorial entitled "The Historic Achievements of the Great Chinese People." The editorial said that the past six years have proven to the world the enormous strength of the People's Republic of China. The editorial emphasized that the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of the Soviet Union, the people of China, and the people of all people's democratic countries is a vivid embodiment of proletarian internationalism. The editorial emphatically pointed out the progressive influence of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the victory of China's building of a new life on the destiny of all Asian people, and the outstanding role played by the People's Republic of China in the struggle for peace in Asia and the world.

On October 1, "Pravda" published an editorial entitled "The Great Holiday of the Chinese People." The editorial said: The founding of the People's Republic of China is a victory of world historical significance for democratic and socialist forces. The appearance of People's China on the world stage has further changed the balance of power in favor of peace and socialism. Now, the People's Republic of China, together with the Soviet Union, is an unbreakable fortress of peace in Asia and the world. The very existence of the People's Republic of China is a powerful factor in the liberation struggle of all oppressed peoples against imperialism and colonial enslavement and for freedom and national independence. The Chinese people are moving forward unswervingly along the path indicated by the heroic Chinese Communist Party. The past six years have shown the world the vitality and great strength of the People's Republic of China. The editorial said: The People's Republic of China is doing its best to strive for a further relaxation of international tensions. It is now impossible to solve international problems without the participation of People's China. The policy of obstructing the People's Republic of China from occupying its legitimate seat in the United Nations is absurd and unreasonable.

The October 1st editorial of Pyongyang's "Rodong Sinmun" stated: "As the Korean people greet the glorious festival of the Chinese people, we would like to sincerely extend brotherly greetings to our closest friends and helpers – the great Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party and its wise leader Comrade Mao Zedong; and warmly congratulate them on the brilliant achievements they have made in the struggle to build a new life." The editorial of "Democratic Korea" wrote: "The achievements made by the Chinese people in the political, economic, and cultural construction in the short period of six years are enormous, and these achievements clearly demonstrate the invincible vitality and consolidation of the People's Republic of China."

The Mongolian "Unen" published an editorial on the 1st entitled "The Glorious Sixth Anniversary of People's China." The editorial said: "The People's Republic of China, together with the Soviet Union, leads the camp of peace and democracy and plays a significant role in the entire international life. The Asian-African Conference and the Geneva Conference have clearly demonstrated that it is impossible to solve major international problems without the participation of a great country like the People's Republic of China."

The title of the editorial of the Czechoslovak "Rudé Právo" is "Six Years of the Glorious Road of People's China." The editorial emphasized, after detailing China's tremendous achievements in socialist construction: The seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored, and the obstacles that hinder the return of the Taiwan islands to the People's Republic of China should be eliminated.

The Indian weekly "Blitz" said in a special supplement recently published to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: "'Blitz' Weekly congratulates the Chinese people on the achievements and development they have gained in the six years since national independence, which are the result of the joint efforts of leaders and people."

    各国报纸庆祝中华人民共和国成立六周年
    据新华社讯　各国报纸发表社论或专文，庆祝中华人民共和国成立六周年。
    九月三十日在布加勒斯特出版的共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主”第三十九期，发表了题为“伟大的中国人民的历史性成就”的社论。社论说，过去的六年已经向全世界证明了中华人民共和国的巨大的力量。社论强调说，苏联人民、中国人民和一切人民民主国家人民间的牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊是无产阶级国际主义的活生生的体现。社论强调指出了中国人民革命的胜利以及中国建设新生活的胜利对所有亚洲人民的命运产生的进步影响以及中华人民共和国在争取亚洲和全世界和平斗争中所起的卓越作用。
    十月一日“真理报”以“中国人民的伟大节日”为题发表社论。社论说：中华人民共和国的成立是民主和社会主义力量的具有全世界历史意义的胜利。人民中国在世界舞台上的出现使力量的对比更加改变得有利于和平和社会主义。现在，中华人民共和国和苏联一道，是亚洲和世界和平的牢不可破的堡垒。中华人民共和国存在这一事实本身就是所有被压迫的人民反对帝国主义和殖民奴役、争取自由和民族独立的解放斗争中的一个强有力的因素。中国人民遵循着英雄的中国共产党所指示的道路坚定不移地前进，过去的六年向全世界表明了中华人民共和国的生命力和伟大的力量。社论说：中华人民共和国竭尽全力来争取国际紧张局势的进一步缓和。没有人民中国的参加，现在是不可能解决国际问题的。阻挠中华人民共和国在联合国占有它的合法地位的那种政策是荒谬无理的。
    平壤“劳动新闻”一日的社论说：“朝鲜人民在迎接中国人民的光荣节日之际，谨向我们最亲近的友人和援助者——伟大的中国人民和中国共产党及其英明的领袖毛泽东同志，衷心地致以兄弟般的敬礼；并且热烈地祝贺他们在建设新生活的斗争中所取得的光辉成就。”“民主朝鲜报”的社论写道：“中国人民在短短的六年间在政治、经济和文化建设中所取得的成就是巨大的，这些成就清楚地证实了中华人民共和国不败的生活力和它的巩固性。”
    蒙古“真理报”一日发表以“人民中国光荣的六周年”为题的社论。社论说：“中华人民共和国和苏联一道领导着和平民主阵营，在整个国际生活中起着重大的作用。亚非会议和日内瓦会议都十分清楚地证明，没有像中华人民共和国这样伟大的国家的参加是无法解决重大的国际问题的。”
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”的社论的题目是“人民中国光辉道路的六年”。社论在详细介绍了中国在社会主义建设方面的巨大成就后强调说：应该恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的席位，应该消除那些阻挠把台湾各岛屿归还中华人民共和国的障碍。
    印度“闪电”周报在最近一期为庆祝中华人民共和国成立六周年而特别出版的增刊中说：“‘闪电’周报祝贺中国人民在国家独立后六个年头中所获得的成就和发展，这些成就和发展是领袖们和人民的共同努力的结果。”
