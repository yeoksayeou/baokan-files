　　Welcoming the United Nations General Assembly's Rational Decision

　　On September 30th, the United Nations General Assembly brushed aside the obstruction of colonial countries, rejected the General Committee's suggestion not to discuss the Algerian issue at this session of the General Assembly, and decided to include the Algerian issue on the agenda. This is a welcome development. This action will help enhance the prestige of this international organization and maintain its dignity. If the United Nations can implement this kind of action, it will be able to play its due role in resolving colonial issues.

　　The Algerian issue was raised to the United Nations by many Asian and African countries in view of the deteriorating situation in Algeria. The United Nations has an unshirkable responsibility to support the legitimate aspirations of the Algerian people. However, under the manipulation of the United States, France, Britain and other colonial countries, the General Committee of the Tenth General Assembly actually refused to include the Algerian issue on the agenda. This practice of the Western powers is, in effect, rejecting the principle of resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation, emasculating the United Nations' role in upholding justice, and attempting to turn the United Nations organization into merely a haven for colonialists. The United Nations General Assembly's rejection of the General Committee's recommendation on September 30th reflects the respect and maintenance of the United Nations Charter by the majority of the United Nations member states, and reflects their hope for further easing of the international situation. Ultimately, this reflects the wishes and determination of hundreds of millions of people around the world.

　　In the process of discussing and voting on including the Algerian issue on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly, the fierce struggle between colonialism and anti-colonialism was vividly reflected. The September 30th decision to put this issue on the General Assembly's agenda is particularly a watershed, making it clear which countries are resolutely safeguarding national independence and which countries are supporters of decadent colonialism. In this struggle, Asian and African countries faithfully implemented the Bandung Conference's resolution on the issue of dependent peoples, strongly condemned the tyranny of the colonialists, and made determined efforts to promote the discussion of the Algerian issue by the United Nations General Assembly. The efforts of Asian and African countries have been supported by countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia, which have consistently advocated the right of colonial peoples to independence. Even in Latin America, which the United States is trying to completely control, six countries, including Mexico, Uruguay, and Bolivia, voted in favor of including the Algerian issue on the agenda. Although the United States, Britain, France and other colonial countries colluded together and held a group of their followers hostage, they still could not prevent the United Nations General Assembly from passing the discussion of the Algerian issue. This situation once again shows that opposing colonialism and advocating national independence has indeed become an irresistible trend of our time. Anyone who tries to resist this trend must be prepared to be submerged by it.

　　The United Nations General Assembly's decision to include the Algerian issue on the agenda also shows a trend within the United Nations: It is becoming increasingly difficult for the United States to control this world organization single-handedly and turn it into a docile tool of the United States. The US attitude on the Algerian issue is very clear. US representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Lodge, publicly stated that the United States believes that Algeria "is an indivisible part of the French Republic under French law." Therefore, the United States opposes including this issue on the agenda. But the US voting machine failed this time, and the United Nations General Assembly did not act according to the will of the United States, which is also a blow to the US policy of trying to weaken the role of the United Nations.

　　It is worth noting that after the United Nations General Assembly decided to include the Algerian issue on the agenda, the French government recalled its delegation to the General Assembly, intending to boycott the United Nations General Assembly. This shows that the French authorities stubbornly refuse to change their colonialist stance on the Algerian issue and are unwilling to see this issue resolved reasonably. This arrogant attitude of the French government can only put itself in an increasingly isolated position.

　　The United Nations General Assembly's decision to discuss the Algerian issue is entirely correct. However, the General Assembly must go further and make effective decisions on this issue, giving the Algerian people who are demanding independence and the right to self-determination the support they deserve. This is truly in line with the wishes of the people of all countries.

    欢迎联合国大会的合理决定
    联合国大会九月三十日排除了殖民国家的阻挠，拒绝了总务委员会提出的在本届大会上不讨论阿尔及利亚问题的建议，决定把阿尔及利亚问题列入大会议程。这是一件值得欢迎的事情。这一行动，有助于提高这一国际组织的威望和维护它的尊严。联合国如果能够把这种行动贯彻下去，它就能够发挥其在解决殖民地问题中应有的作用。
    阿尔及利亚问题，是许多亚非国家有鉴于阿尔及利亚局势的日益恶化而向联合国提出的。联合国在支持阿尔及利亚人民合法愿望上，本来有着不可推诿的责任。但是十届联大总务委员会在美、法、英等殖民国家的操纵之下，竟然拒绝把阿尔及利亚问题列入议程。西方大国的这种作法，实际上是拒绝以和平协商的方式来解决国际纷争的方针，阉割联合国主持正义的作用，而企图把联合国组织变成只是殖民主义者的庇护所。联合国大会九月三十日会议否决总务委员会的建议，反映了联合国大多数会员国对于联合国宪章的尊重和维护，反映了它们对于进一步缓和国际局势的企望。归根到底，这反映了全世界千千万万人民的愿望和决心。
    在本届联大讨论和表决把阿尔及利亚问题列入议程的过程中，鲜明地反映出了殖民主义和反殖民主义两条路线的激烈斗争。九月三十日关于把这个问题列入大会议程的决定特别是一条分水线，它使人清楚地看到那一些国家坚决维护民族独立，那一些国家是腐朽的殖民主义的拥护者。在这个斗争中，亚非国家忠实地执行万隆会议关于附属地人民问题的决议，强烈谴责了殖民主义者的暴政，并以坚定的努力促使联合国大会讨论阿尔及利亚问题。亚非国家的努力，得到了一贯主张殖民地人民独立权利的苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和南斯拉夫等国家的支持。甚至在美国竭力企图完全控制的拉丁美洲，也有墨西哥、乌拉圭、玻利维亚等六个国家投票赞成把阿尔及利亚问题列入议程。美、英、法等殖民国家虽然勾结在一起，并且挟持了它们的一批追随者，仍然无法阻止联合国大会通过讨论阿尔及利亚问题。这种情况再一次说明了，反对殖民主义和主张民族独立，的的确确已成为我们这个时代的不可抗拒的潮流。谁要企图抵拒这种潮流，谁就要准备被这种潮流所淹没。
    联合国大会通过把阿尔及利亚问题列入议程的决定，也表明了联合国内的一个趋势：美国想一手控制这一世界组织，使它成为美国驯服的工具是愈来愈困难了。美国在阿尔及利亚问题上的态度是很清楚的。美国出席联合国大会的代表洛奇就公开说，美国认为阿尔及利亚“根据法国的法律在行政上是法兰西共和国的不可分割的部分”。因此，美国反对把这个问题列入议程。但是美国的表决机器这一次失灵了，联合国大会并没有按照美国的意旨行事，这对于美国力图削弱联合国的作用的政策，也是一个打击。
    值得注意的是，在联合国大会决定把阿尔及利亚问题列入议程后，法国政府召回了它出席联大的代表团，打算对联合国大会进行抵制。这说明，法国当局顽固地不肯改变它对阿尔及利亚问题的殖民主义立场，不愿意使这个问题获得合理的解决。法国政府这种蛮横态度，只能使自己越来越处于孤立的地位。
    联合国大会决定讨论阿尔及利亚问题，是完全正确的。但是大会还必须更进一步在这个问题上作出有效的决定，给予要求独立和自决权利的阿尔及利亚人民以应有的支持。这才是真正符合各国人民的愿望的。
