    Nie Er's Road
    --Commemorating the Twentieth Anniversary of the Death of People's Musician Nie Er
  　Huan Zhi
    I. "Genius is Labor"
    Nie Er was a talented Chinese composer. Nie Er's life was a life of struggle, a life of tenacious labor. Nie Er was a young man from a poor family. He not only had no opportunity to receive formal musical education, but even ordinary education had to be exchanged for his mother's hard work, borrowing money everywhere, and his own diligent study - even hand-copying textbooks.
    A keen sense of advanced ideas and new things, and the courage to pursue them, are excellent qualities that Nie Er showed from his youth. He grew up in the great storm of the people's democratic revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party. The impact of the new era on him was very strong. He was greatly dissatisfied with the limited knowledge he could obtain from school education, so he diligently read various meaningful books. His strong desire for knowledge shows that he was eager to understand the new things in real life, and demanded himself to become a person with advanced ideas and qualities in the great era.
    Learning - improving one's ideological cultivation - became Nie Er's uninterrupted labor habit. Because he realized: "No matter which road you run on, it is difficult to get through if your philosophical foundation is unstable." - (Nie Er's Diary) - "If the brain is not cultivated with correct thinking, no matter how developed it is, this development will always be deformed, then all behaviors will not have a stable and correct foothold." After he left school and went to work in society, no matter how busy he was, he could still often read the classic works of Marxism-Leninism. Because he realized that there is no end to learning, "The cultivation of a new brain is not cast once with a model and a set that will never rot. It is like a small plant that needs reasonable irrigation at any time. If you don't give it the nourishment it deserves every day, or give it unevenly, sometimes hungry and sometimes full, its life will always be withered and incorrect." When he was in the "Mingyue" dance troupe, he was so busy that he couldn't spare time to read, but he never excused himself for this. He asked himself: "I feel that I have really regressed too much in reading recently. Can I just muddle along like this every day?" He was so strict in demanding his own ideological progress, he worked tirelessly and actively participated in the revolutionary struggle, and he finally became a strong fighter of the working class.
    Nie Er showed his artistic talent from an early age, and his talent was multifaceted. He came into contact with his own national music at a very young age, and learned various Chinese musical instruments - flute, erhu, sanxian, and yueqin - at the age of ten. He was also a talented actor, and once (at the age of eighteen) thought he could be a writer! He had a higher interest in music, and he had a keen sense of tone from an early age. His tenacious study and painstaking artistic labor made him a talented composer of the Chinese people.
    Nie Er's creative life officially began at the age of twenty-two. This year was also the year he determined his communist outlook on life and joined the Chinese Communist Party. From then on, his creative life quickly entered an unusually rich and active period. Most of his works - that is, his best works - were only produced from 1934 to before April 1935. In this short period of more than a year, he was able to write so many outstanding songs, which fully revealed that he had rich life experience, sensitivity to new things, and superior creative talent. He engaged in his combative creative labor with an extremely serious, cautious, and highly responsible attitude towards the people and the revolutionary cause. The creation of each song went through careful consideration, and he often walked a long distance to experience and observe the lives of the working people. Once a song was completed, he had to carefully and repeatedly deliberate, solicit and humbly listen to the opinions of friends.
    "Genius is labor" (Gorky), this sentence has been proven in Nie Er's fighting life.
    II. The Glorious Road
    Nie Er's uninterrupted pursuit and study of advanced ideas, and his continuous expansion of his vision of real life, were the foundation for him to become a revolutionary people's composer. The "Preliminary Draft of Nie Er's Chronology" (by Hong Qiu) records: "On the day of his twentieth birthday, he felt very deeply and determined to catch up with the times. He made a ruthless criticism of his life of simply pursuing music and being divorced from actual revolutionary struggle. He asked himself: 'What if I practice so hard and become a violinist in a few years or decades?' 'Can you excite and inspire the emotions of the working masses?' He answered himself: 'No, this road will not work, wake up early!' (Diary of February 7). From this, he put forward an important topic for himself: 'How to make revolutionary music?'" Since then, he has worked hard to show in his artistic thought and artistic creation how he is to put into practice the topic he has put forward for himself.
    He wrote some combative short articles, sharply criticizing the decadent style of yellow art of the "Mingyue Opera Troupe," and put forward: "What we need is not soft tofu, but real swords and guns!" ("A Brief Discussion on Chinese Songs and Dances") Because he witnessed that class contradictions were so sharp: "Capitalists live in high-rise buildings and enjoy their happiness; workers are sweating profusely and crying secretly under the machines." (Ibid.) If art is to reflect this era, it must truthfully and profoundly reflect the sharp class contradictions in real life, and it is far from enough to have only a little anti-feudal consciousness. Where should art go? Nie Er saw it very clearly: "Don't you hear that on this earth, there are endless groups of people shouting and roaring around you; you must go deep into that mass, and here, you will have fresh materials to create fresh art. Hey! Work hard! That is the road of the times!" How loud is this call, how clear is the thought. He wrote in his diary on June 3, 1933: "Music, like other arts, is to shout for the masses. The masses will inevitably demand new content and performance of music, as well as a new attitude from composers. ... Revolutionary composers who accept revolution must compose revolutionary music that maintains a high artistic standard."
    In this year, Nie Er began his fighting creative life with "Song of Hunger and Cold" and "Song of Mining." In the history of modern Chinese music, Nie Er was the first to sing with such enthusiasm and full of glorious conviction to praise the working people and the power of the working class.
    Before Nie Er, which composer dared to hold high the banner of the people's revolution, throw himself into the ranks of the working class vanguard, closely link the cause of music with the cause of revolution, let music serve the needs of revolutionary struggle, and use music as a powerful weapon for class struggle and national liberation struggle? Nie Er used the image of the song to truthfully and profoundly portray the life and struggle of the oppressed working class and the broad masses of people, never standing in the position of an onlooker. Therefore, his works are always full of the heroic working class's sense of ownership, singing proudly like in "Pioneer": "We are the pioneers." Always full of confidence, predicting the victory of the revolutionary struggle, like he sang firmly in "Self-Defense Song": "Today is an oppressed nation, tomorrow everything belongs to us!"
    Nie Er correctly understood the growing strength of the Chinese revolutionary masses led by the working class. His works broadly express the oppressed people of all classes, including the vast poor peasants, urban handicraft workers, coolies, newspaper boys, and singers... and revolutionary educated youths from the same background as Nie Er himself. The fate of the people is connected to a common goal of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. They converge into an invincible, vast, and strong revolutionary team, just like the grand momentum he expressed in "Marching Song" and "March of the Volunteers." In this way, Nie Er's singing became the horn of the times, a powerful force of encouragement and organization in the Chinese people's democratic revolutionary struggle.
    Nie Er's creative road is the road of realism. He always carefully listens to the tones of life, the tones of the lives of the working masses. He wrote in his diary: "Without contact with life, you cannot write for life. Without cultivating your own personality, you cannot produce great works." Therefore, he often went to factories, wharves, and various workplaces of the working people to experience and observe. In Zheng Yili's article "Reminiscences of Nie Er," it is described that Nie Er created "New Woman": "'New Woman's' creation was quite difficult. In order to understand the scene of female textile workers working the day shift, he had to rush from Avenue Joffre to the area of the Big Ben on Route Say Zoong very early in the morning to observe. He needed to go very early, and there was no tram, so he had to take advantage of the stars in the sky and the frost all over the ground on an autumn night, and walk for more than an hour to get near the textile factory. At the same time, he also talked to the female workers he taught to sing, visited their residences, and observed their workshops. Only then did he have a clue in his heart before he began to create."
    Because Nie Er was so eager to pursue the understanding of the broad real life, and had unparalleled enthusiasm for the labor and struggle of the people, he was able to construct the tones of real life into the tonal basis of his works. Furthermore, because he correctly understood the people, and he had already integrated his own thoughts and feelings with those of the revolutionary masses, he successfully created typical images of the revolutionary masses in song music. His melodies essentially embody the heroic and noble qualities and spiritual outlook of the Chinese people in the struggle for freedom and independence.
    III. Profound Popularity
    Nie Er pioneered the road of socialist realism for modern Chinese musical creation. Nie Er was the first composer in China who could correctly inherit the excellent qualities of national musical traditions and creatively develop them. Nie Er came into contact with his own national music from an early age. The more intense his love for music became, the deeper and wider his learning and research on national music became. It can be seen from his diaries and letters that Nie Er consistently valued national music. He studied and recorded folk songs, and he was familiar with the performance techniques of various folk musical instruments. When he worked at the Shanghai Baidai Company, he also compiled four folk instrumental pieces and recorded them into records. In terms of musical temperament, he was deeply rooted in the national musical tradition. Therefore, the tonal system of national music and the aesthetic principles of realism gave him important influences when conceiving musical images.
    If we carefully analyze all of Nie Er's works, we can easily find that the national tonal characteristics are not accidental, but a common and distinct characteristic. Whether it is his combative marches and labor songs, or lyrical folk songs and dramatic solo songs, he can construct distinct national characteristics according to different genres. Nie Er's works extensively use various folk modes -- re mode, ea mode, do mode, and SOL mode, etc. -- and the frequent appearance of rhythms and melodies of folk labor songs are even more prominent phenomena. The mode used in "Road Song" is by no means a reprint of the European-style minor scale. Its diminished fourth interval leap not only constitutes the characteristic of the natural intonation in the labor shout, but also enhances the power of the labor mood. We can also find that many of his tunes are similar to folk songs. The profound influence of folk music on his creation is very obvious.
    The national tonal system is expressed very vividly in Nie Er's creation, with fresh and lively characteristics. We don't need to find too many examples to explain that Nie Er's melody comes from which folk tune. This alone cannot essentially explain his creative work in the national form of music.
    The national tonal system is formed by each nation in a specific historical development. The system itself certainly has some relatively stable factors, such as mode, rhythm, genre, language expression, language decoration, performance techniques and timbre of folk musical instruments, etc., but these factors can only serve as the basis for the tonal system to continue to develop. The system itself is always developing towards more and more rich and colorful aspects. This fact has been fully proven by the historical process of the formation of the tonal system. On the other hand, the tones of national music always take the lives of the people as its infinitely rich source. There are rich and diverse tonal images in real life, which are the sound prototypes that constitute musical images. The people and their musicians of past dynasties, under the conditions of specific economic life, exerted their creative talents to elevate the tones of real life into musical images, and formed a relatively stable tonal system in the long historical development. In this process, the mutual exchange of material and spiritual life among various ethnic groups has also become an important influence on the composition of the national tonal system.
    Nie Er's creative practice proves that he understood very well the aesthetic principles of realism in the national tonal system. He correctly inherited the principles and methods of realism in the Chinese people's musical tradition. On the one hand, he highly respected the musical tradition of his own nation, and on the other hand, he also worked hard to study and learn from the achievements of world revolutionary music and classical music. And the rich tones in the real life of the people's revolution -- including the new qualities of poetic language, the call to fight, the shouts of resistance from laborers, etc. -- are always the tonal basis of Nie Er's song creation. Therefore, Nie Er's creation is not limited by the inherent tonal system of the nation. He absorbs advanced factors from Western Europe in terms of scales, rhythms, and meters, especially the combat-oriented expression methods of Soviet revolutionary songs. In this way, he added new elements to his own national inherent tonal system, created new tones for national combat-oriented marches, expanded the expressive forms of lyrical songs, and at the same time, he found tones that could tap the beauty of poetic language from the passionate language of revolutionary poetry.
    This is how Nie Er excellently inherited the realistic tradition of national music and created a musical style and form that adapted to the new life of the Chinese people. These make Nie Er's songs have profound popularity.
    IV. Clear Musical Image
    Nie Er has a very high talent in melody creation, and his songs all have vivid and moving musical images.
    Nie Er's sense of tone is very keen, and his conception of musical images is therefore very rich. He is good at creating different tonal characteristics according to the different life and emotional contents reflected in different poems, and constructing very clear musical images. Therefore, the character of each of his songs is exceptionally distinct, and the life content it reflects is exceptionally concentrated and prominent. For example, in his many labor songs, it is difficult for us to find that they are mutually similar and fall into a general situation. Just compare "Dock Workers," "Road Song," "Hitting the Yangtze River," "Pile Driving Song," "Brick Making Song," and "Echo Song" in "New Woman," and you can understand how rich Nie Er's musical imagination is. They create the multifaceted nature of the musical image of the working people in terms of both melody and rhythm.
    His combat-oriented marches also have their own characteristics. For example, "March of the Volunteers" has the majestic tonal characteristics of solemnity and inviolability; "Self-Defense Song" has the calm and firm tonal characteristics of cutting through the nail and chopping the iron; "Marching Song" has the momentum of a giant who is indestructible and goes forward courageously; "Pioneer" is a momentum of pride and confidence like a landslide; "Graduation Song" creates an image of enthusiastic, idealistic, and vigorous young people; "Slaves, Arise" expresses the heroic and unyielding, earth-shattering great spirit of the working class.
    Where did Nie Er's excellent melody creation talent come from? I think that in addition to his certain musical literacy, it is because he has rich life practice and a deep observation of life. The creation process of each of his songs is a process of repeated experience and deep observation of life, until he is sure in his heart, and the conception of the musical image has a basis. He likes to listen to the tones of life, and he is good at capturing the essential characteristics of life through various life phenomena, and digging into the depths of people's emotional life. The images of his labor songs all vividly have the tonal characteristics of labor life. For example, the uninterrupted rhythm in "Brick Making Song" (there is not a single rest in the whole song), the heavy footsteps of the "Dock Workers" living under heavy pressure, the call and protest against the exploited life; the life scene and mood of the workers in "Echo Song" in the hazy night before dawn, being urged to go to work by the long whistle, one sound tighter than the other; the tone and rhythm of "Newspaper Selling Song" running and calling for life day and night in the streets and alleys -- these all eloquently prove that life is an incomparably rich source of melody creation.
    Nie Er is good at using concise and refined musical language to shape images. His musical ideas are very clear. He does not casually use too many notes and too wide a range, and the processing of rhythm is also very concentrated and organized. He has also carefully studied and tasted the tones of poetic language. He does not stay in the superficial arrangement of intonation, but uses original and rich musical imagination to more broadly and deeply develop the inherent beauty of poetry. Therefore, the combination of his melody and poetry is seamlessly integrated, but it is not always the same.
    In dealing with the structure of songs, Nie Er also has a high degree of organizational talent. He is good at arranging contrasting musical images according to the development of the emotional content of poetry. Like he unified and varied in "Hitting the Yangtze River," "Pile Driving Song," "Road Song," and "Self-Defense Song." And for some poems that are not very neat in form, he showed his very perfect structural skills. For example, "Graduation Song" is a song without a falling section and repetition, and the words are also of varying lengths, but Nie Er's fluency and completeness in the musical phrasing are very admirable. Nie Er not only never avoids odd-numbered bars or phrases, but uses them very frequently. He will not artificially make odd-numbered bars or phrases into even numbers in order to form a tofu-block-like format. For example, the three phrases in the middle section of "Graduation Song": "We are going to choose war... soar to the sky." This is a section composed of a question and two answers. Due to the proper arrangement of the middle termination, the three phrases appear very balanced. Another example is the three short phrases in the middle section of "Pile Driving Song": "Oh! The sun... pleasant." Its second short sentence uses upward progression as an extension of the first short sentence, and then uses the middle cadence to form a very affirmative tone of pause. There is also the continuous short phrase group in "Dock Workers": "Heavy sacks, steel bars,... for two meals that are not enough to eat." The weight accumulated by the four short phrases is concentrated on two strong fourth tones ("press bar"), and then pauses on the indignant third tone as a middle cadence.
    The treatment of these passages all demonstrates Nie Er's ingenious organizational talent. He realized the simplicity of the unconstrained flow of emotions from the tones of poetic recitation. Therefore, he can effortlessly organize these irregular sentences into very smooth passages.
    Nie Er created a new era of style in song form and genre. He is so highly centralized and unconstrained; he is so free, unrestrained, and not exaggerated. His musical image typically summarizes the simple, straightforward, bright, free, and enthusiastic temperament of the Chinese working people.
    V. Conclusion
    With his short and diligent life, and with his fighting creative labor, Nie Er opened up a road for the Chinese people's revolutionary music cause and set a brilliant example of socialist realism as the creative principle. His more than thirty posthumous works have the unshakeable epoch-making significance and extraordinary value.
    This year is the twentieth anniversary of Nie Er's death. The Chinese people have stood up from the difficult revolutionary struggle and achieved unprecedented brilliant victories. Now they are entering the third year of the first great five-year plan construction. Let us review the growth of the people's revolutionary music cause over the past 20 years -- it was cultivated by the blood and sweat of Nie Er, Xian Xinghai, and many excellent composers and musicians who sacrificed in the revolutionary struggle. And it was built by our vast number of musical workers who are loyal to the people with arduous and tenacious struggles and labor. We should more earnestly follow the path pioneered by Nie Er, strengthen our struggle, and let our creative work be worthy of the achievements of the people's revolutionary music cause over the past 20 years, worthy of the immortal achievements of our predecessors Nie Er and Xian Xinghai, and worthy of the beautiful motherland built by the great Chinese people with immeasurable blood and sweat!

    聂耳的道路
    ——纪念人民音乐家聂耳逝世二十周年
  　焕之
    一、“天才就是劳动”
    聂耳是中国人民的天才的作曲家。聂耳的一生，是战斗的一生，是顽强劳动的一生。聂耳是一个出身穷苦家庭的青年，他不仅没有机会受正规的音乐教育，就连普通的教育也不得不用母亲的辛勤劳动、到处借钱和自己的刻苦学习——甚至手抄课本——换来的。
    对于先进思想和新鲜事物的敏锐感觉和勇敢的追求，是聂耳从少年时代起就表现出来的优秀素质。他生长在中国共产党所领导的人民民主革命的大风暴中，新的时代给他的影响是很强烈的，他大大不满足于从学校教育中所能获得的有限的知识，因此他用功阅读各种有意义的书籍。他的强烈的求知欲望，说明他急切地要认识现实生活中新生的东西，并且要求自己在大时代中成为一个具有先进思想和品质的人。
    学习——提高自己的思想修养——成了聂耳从不间断的劳动习惯。因为他认识到：“不论你从哪一条路跑，你对于哲学的基础不稳定，终于是难得走通的。”——（聂耳的日记）——“脑筋若无正确的思想的培养，任它怎样发达，这发达总是畸形的发达，那么一切的行为都没有稳定的正确的立足点。”当他离开学校到社会上做事情以后，不管工作多么繁忙，他仍然能经常阅读马克思列宁主义的经典著作。因为他认识到学习是没有止境的，“新的脑子的培养不是用一个模型一套便一次铸成永不会腐破的，它正如一棵嫩小的植物随时需要合理的灌溉，你若天天不给它应得的养料，或不平均的给它忽饿忽饱，它的一生总是枯萎不正的。”当他在“明月”歌舞团时，实在忙得抽不出工夫来读书，但他从不因此而原谅自己，他问自己说：“我感觉到我最近在读书方面实在太退步了，是不是一天这样疏懒下去便可了事呢？”他是如此严格地要求自己思想的进步，他不懈的辛勤学习，并积极地参加革命斗争，他终于成为一员工人阶级的坚强战士。
    聂耳从小就显露他的艺术才能，他的天才是多方面的。他很小就接触自己民族的音乐，十岁时就学会了各种中国乐器——笛子、二胡、三弦和月琴。他也是一个天才的演员，而曾经一度（十八岁）还以为自己可以作文学家呢！他对于音乐具有更高的兴趣，他从小就具有对音调的敏锐的感觉力，他的顽强学习、刻苦钻研的艺术劳动使他成为中国人民的天才作曲家。
    聂耳的创作生活是从二十二岁才正式开始的，这一年也正是他确定了共产主义的人生观，参加了中国共产党。从此他的创作生活很快就进入了异常丰富而活跃的时期。他的大多数作品——也就是他最优秀的作品——都只是在一九三四年到一九三五年四月以前产生的。在这短短的一年多的时间里，他能写出这样多卓越的歌曲，就充分显露出他具有丰富的生活体验，对于新鲜事物的敏感和优越的创作才能。他以极严肃的、审慎的、对人民和革命事业的高度责任感来从事他战斗性的创作劳动，每一首歌曲的创作，都经过深思熟虑，而且经常步行很远去体验、观察劳动人民的生活。一曲既成；还得仔细地反复推敲，征求并虚心听取朋友们的意见。
    “天才就是劳动”（高尔基语），这句话在聂耳的战斗的一生里得到了证明。
    二、光辉的道路
    聂耳对于先进思想的不间断的追求、钻研，以及对现实生活的视野的不断扩展，是他成为革命的人民作曲家的基础。在“聂耳年表初稿”（洪遒作）中记载说：“二十足岁的生辰那一天，他感触很深，决心要赶上时代，对于自己单纯追求音乐、脱离实际革命斗争的生活，作了无情的批判。他问自己：‘这样地刻苦练习，几年、几十年后成为一个提琴家又怎样呢？’‘你能够兴奋起、鼓动起劳动群众的情绪吗？’他自己回答自己说：‘不对，此路不通，早些醒悟吧！’（二月七日日记）。从这开始，给自己提出重要的课题：‘怎样去做革命的音乐？’”从此，他在艺术思想与艺术创作上都努力表明了他是如何去实践他为自己提出的课题。
    他写了一些战斗性的短文，尖锐地批评“明月歌剧社”的黄色艺术的颓废作风，提出了：“我们所需要的不是软豆腐，而是真刀真枪的硬功夫！”（“中国歌舞短论”）因为他目睹阶级的矛盾是如此尖锐：“资本家住在高楼大厦大享其福；工人们汗水淋漓地在机械下暗哭。”（同上）艺术要反映这个时代，就必需真实而深刻地反映现实生活中的尖锐的阶级矛盾，仅只有一点反封建意识是大大不够了的。艺术该向何处去呢？聂耳看得十分清楚：“你不听见在这地球上，有着无穷的一群人在你周围呐喊、狂呼；你要向那群众深入，在这里面，你将有新鲜的材料，创造出新鲜的艺术。喂！努力！那条才是时代的大路！”这号召多么响亮，思想多么明确。他在一九三三年六月三日的日记中写道：“音乐和其它艺术一样，是代替大众呐喊，大众必然要求音乐的新的内容和演奏，以及作曲家的新态度。……接受革命的作曲家们，要编出革命的、同时保持高度艺术水准的音乐。”
    就在这一年，聂耳以“饥寒交迫之歌”和“开矿歌”开始了他的战斗的创作生活。在中国近代音乐史上，聂耳是第一个如此充满热情、充满着光辉的信念来歌颂劳动人民，歌颂工人阶级的力量。
    在聂耳之前，有那一个作曲家像他这样勇敢地擎起人民革命的大旗，投身于工人阶级先锋队的行列中，把音乐的事业同革命的事业紧密的联结起来，让音乐服从于革命斗争的需要，以音乐作为阶级斗争和民族解放斗争的有力武器？聂耳用歌曲的形象真实而深刻地刻划了被压迫的工人阶级和广大人民的生活和斗争，从来不是站在旁观者的地位。所以他的作品总是充满了豪迈的工人阶级的主人翁的感情，像在“开路先锋”中那样自豪地歌唱着：“我们是开路的先锋”。总是满怀信心的预示着革命斗争的胜利，像他在“自卫歌”中那样坚定地唱着：“今天是被压迫的民族，明天一切属于我们自己！”
    聂耳正确地理解到以工人阶级为领导的中国革命群众的壮大的力量。在他的作品中是那样广阔地表现了各个阶层的被压迫的人民大众，包括广大的贫苦农民、城市手工业工人、苦力、卖报童和歌女……等。还有像聂耳自己一样出身的革命知识青年。人民大众的命运是连接在一个反帝反封建的共同斗争目标上，他们汇合成一支不可战胜的、广大强壮的革命队伍，就像他表现在“前进歌”和“义勇军进行曲”中那样浩大的气魄。这样，聂耳的歌声成为时代的号角，成为中国人民民主革命斗争中的强大的鼓舞和组织的力量。
    聂耳的创作道路是现实主义的道路，他总是细心地倾听生活的音调，倾听劳动群众的生活音调。他在日记上写道：“不同生活接触，不能为生活的著作，不锻炼自己的人格，无由产生伟大的作品。”因此他经常到工厂和码头及各种劳动人民的工作场所去体验、观察。在郑易里的“回忆聂耳二三事”一文中记述了聂耳创作“新女性”的情况：“‘新女性’的创作是相当艰苦的。他为要体会纱厂女工上日班的情景，不得不在清早从霞飞路赶到沪西路大自鸣钟一带去观察。需要去得很早，又没有电车，他就不得不趁着星星在天、寒霜遍地的秋夜，步行一个多钟头，赶到纱厂附近去。同时，他又找他教歌的女工们谈话，到她们住处去访问，到她们的车间去观察，然后心中有了谱才开始创作。”
    由于聂耳是这样热切地追求对于广阔的现实生活的认识，对于人民的劳动与斗争有着无比的热情，他才有可能把现实生活的音调构成他作品中的音调基础。更由于他正确地理解人民，他已经把自己和革命群众的思想感情融然无间地结合起来，这样，他成功地创造了歌曲音乐中的革命群众的典型形象。他的曲调是本质地体现着中国人民在为争取自由和独立的斗争中，所具有的英雄的、崇高的品质和精神面貌。
    三、深刻的人民性
    聂耳为中国近代的音乐创作开辟了社会主义现实主义的道路。聂耳是中国第一个能够正确地继承民族音乐传统中的优秀素质，并创造性地发展了它的作曲家。聂耳从小就接触自己民族的音乐，他对音乐的热爱越来越强烈的时候，也就是他对民族音乐的学习和研究越来越深、越来越广的时候。从他的日记和书信中可以看出：聂耳是一贯地重视民族音乐的，他学习和记录民间歌曲，他熟悉多种民间乐器的演奏技巧。当他在上海百代公司任职时，他还整理了四首民间器乐曲并灌制成唱片。他在音乐的气质方面，是深深地扎根在民族的音乐传统中的。因此，民族音乐的音调体系和现实主义的美学原则给予他在构思音乐形象时以重要的影响。
    如果把聂耳的全部作品仔细分析一下，我们不难发现民族的音调特征并不是偶然地出现，而是一个普遍而鲜明的特征。不论是他的战斗性的进行曲和劳动歌曲、或者是抒情性的民歌和戏剧性的独唱曲，他都能按照不同的体裁构成鲜明的民族特点。聂耳作品中对各种民间调式——re调、ea调、do调和SOL调等——的广泛的应用，民间劳动歌曲的节奏和音调的经常出现，更是非常突出的现象。“大路歌”所用的调式，绝不是欧洲型小音阶的再版，它的减四度音程的跃进，不但构成了劳动呼声中自然语势的特征，而且增强了劳动情绪的力量。我们还可以找出他的许多曲调是和民歌的曲调近似的。民间音乐对他创作的深刻影响是很显然的。
    民族的音调体系在聂耳的创作中表现得十分富于生命力，具有新鲜活泼的特质。我们不必要过多地寻找例证去说明聂耳的曲调出自那一首民间曲调，仅只这样并不能本质地说明他在音乐的民族形式上的创造性工作。
    民族的音调体系是每个民族在特定的历史发展中形成起来的，体系本身固然有它比较稳定的一些因素，如调式、节奏、体裁、语言的表现、语言的装饰、民间乐器的演奏技巧及音色等，但这些因素只能作为音调体系还要向前发展的基础。体系本身总是向着越来越丰富、越来越多采的方面去发展的。这个事实从音调体系形成的历史过程就已得到了充分的证明。另一方面，民族音乐的音调总是以人民的生活作为它无限丰富的源泉，在现实生活中就存在着丰富多样的音调形象，这是构成音乐形象的声音原型。历代人民及其音乐家在特定的经济生活的条件下，发挥其创造的才能，把现实生活的音调提升为音乐的形象，而在久远的历史发展中形成了比较稳定的音调体系。在这过程中，各个民族在物质生活与精神生活的互相交流，也成为民族音调体系构成上的重要影响。
    聂耳的创作实践，证明了他十分懂得民族音调体系中的现实主义的美学原则，他就是正确地继承了中国人民音乐传统中的现实主义的原则和方法。他一方面十分尊重自己民族的音乐传统，另一方面他也努力钻研并借鉴世界革命音乐及古典音乐的成就。而人民革命的现实生活中的丰富的音调——包括诗的语言的新特质、战斗的号召，劳动者抗争的呼声，……等——总是聂耳歌曲创作的音调基础。因此，聂耳的创作不为民族固有的音调体系所局限，他从音阶、节奏和节拍等方面吸收西欧的先进因素，尤其是苏联革命歌曲的战斗性的表现方法。这样他在自己民族固有的音调体系中增加了新的因素，创造了民族的战斗性进行曲的新音调，扩展了抒情歌曲的表现形式，同时他从革命诗歌的热情的语言中，寻找到能够发掘诗的语言的美的音调。
    聂耳就是这样优秀地继承了民族音乐的现实主义传统，创造了和中国人民新的生活面貌相适应的音乐风格和形式。这些使聂耳的歌曲具有深刻的人民性。
    四、明朗的音乐形象
    聂耳在曲调创作上是有很高的才能的，他的歌曲都有着鲜明动人的音乐形象。
    聂耳对于音调的感觉非常敏锐，他的音乐形象的构思因而也十分丰富。他善于根据不同的诗歌所反映的不同的生活感情内容，去创造不同的音调特征，构成非常明了的音乐形象。因此，他的每一首歌曲的性格是异常鲜明的，它所反映的生活内容是异常集中而突出的。譬如在他的许多劳动歌曲中，我们很难找出它们互相雷同而陷于一般化的状况。只要把“码头工人”、“大路歌”、“打长江”、“打桩歌”、“打砖歌”和“新女性”中的“回声歌”等比较一下，就可以了解到聂耳的音乐想像是多么丰富，它们不论在旋律和节奏方面都创造了劳动人民的音乐形象的多面性。
    他的战斗性的进行曲也都是各具特点，譬如“义勇军进行曲”具有严正不容侵犯的雄伟的音调特征；“自卫歌”具有斩钉截铁的沉着坚定的音调特征；“前进歌”具有巨人般的无坚不摧、勇往直前的气势；“开路先锋”是具有自豪的、有信心的排山倒海般的气势；“毕业歌”创造了热情而富于理想、朝气蓬勃的青年人的形象；“奴隶们起来”却表现了英勇不屈，顶天立地的工人阶级的伟大气魄。
    聂耳的优异的曲调创作才能，是从什么地方得到的呢？我想除了他具有一定的音乐素养之外，就是因为他有着丰富的生活实践，有着对生活的深刻观察力。他的每首歌曲的创作过程都是经过对生活的反复体验和深刻的观察，直到心中有数，音乐形象的构思才有了根据。他喜爱倾听生活中的音调，善于透过种种生活的现象去捕捉生活中本质的特征，去发掘人们感情生活的深处。他的劳动歌曲的形象，都十分鲜明地具有劳动生活的音调特征，譬如“打砖歌”中那种不间断的节奏（全曲没有一个休止符），“码头工人”中那种生活在重压下的沉重的足音，那种对被剥削生活的呼唤和抗议；“回声歌”中那种在黎明前的朦胧夜色中，工人们被那冗长的汽笛声一声紧似一声地催促着上工去的生活景象和心情；“卖报歌”中那种日夜在大街小巷为生活而奔走呼号的音调和节奏——这些都雄辩地证明了：生活是曲调创作的无比丰富的源泉。
    聂耳善于运用简洁精炼的音乐语言来塑造形象，他的乐旨都是十分明了，不随便用过多的音和过广的音域，节奏的处理也十分集中而有组织。对于诗的语言的音调，他也都经过仔细的推敲和体味，他并不停留在表面的抑扬顿挫的安排，而用独创性的丰富的音乐想像来更广阔、更深刻地发挥诗的内在的美。所以他的曲调和诗的结合是融然一体，但却不是千篇一律的。
    在处理歌曲的结构上，聂耳也具有高度的组织才能，他善于按照诗的情绪内容的发展，安排着对比的音乐形象。像他在“打长江”、“打桩歌”、“大路歌”和“自卫歌”等那样统一而富于变化。而对于一些在形式上不很整齐的诗歌，更表现出他的十分完美的结构技巧，譬如“毕业歌”是一首没有落段的重复，词句也长短不一，但聂耳在音乐的章句法上那种流畅性和完整性是十分令人折服的。对于奇数的小节或乐句，聂耳不仅从不忌讳，而却应用得十分频繁，他不会为了要构成豆腐块一样的格式而人为地让奇数的小节或乐句弄成偶数。譬如在“毕业歌”中间乐段的三个乐句：“我们是要选择战……青云直上。”这是用一个问句和两个答句构成的乐段，由于中间终止的妥善安排，使三个乐句显得十分均衡。又如“打桩歌”中间乐段的三个短乐句：“哎哟！太阳……惬意啊。”它的第二个短句以向上的进行作为第一个短句的引伸，继而用中间终止式构成了十分肯定的语气的停顿。还有“码头工人”中的短乐汇群的连续：“笨重的麻袋，钢条，……为了两顿吃不饱的饭。”四个短乐汇所积累下来重量，都集中到两个强硬的第四度音（“压吧”）上，接着停顿在愤慨不平的第三度音上作为中间终止。
    这些乐段的处理，都表现了聂耳的巧妙的组织才能。他从诗的朗诵的音调中，体会到那种感情毫无拘束地奔流的纯朴性，因此，他能把这些不整齐的句子毫不费力地组织成非常流畅的乐段。
    聂耳在歌曲形式和体裁上，创造了新时代的风格。他是这样具有高度的集中性而毫不拘谨；他又是这样自由、奔放而毫不夸大，他的音乐形象是典型地概括了中国劳动人民的纯朴、爽朗、明快、自由而热情的气质。
    五、结语
    聂耳以他短暂的勤奋的一生，以他战斗的创作劳动，为中国人民革命的音乐事业开辟了道路，树立了以社会主义现实主义为创作原则的光辉榜样。他的三十余首遗作是具有着确定不移的划时代的意义和非凡的价值的。
    今年是聂耳逝世二十周年纪念，中国人民已经从艰难困苦的革命斗争中站立起来，取得了史无前例的光辉胜利，现在正进入第一个伟大的五年计划建设的第三个年头。让我们回顾一下二十多年来人民革命音乐事业的成长，——那是聂耳、冼星海以及许多在革命斗争中牺牲了的优秀的作曲家音乐家们的血汗所培育的。还有我们广大的忠实于人民的音乐工作者用艰巨顽强的战斗和劳动所建树起来的。我们应当更加切实地遵循聂耳所开辟的道路，加强我们的战斗，让我们的创造工作无愧于二十多年来人民革命音乐事业所获得的成就，无愧于我们的先行者聂耳和冼星海的不朽的业绩，无愧于伟大的中国人民用无可估量的血汗所建造起来的美丽的祖国！
