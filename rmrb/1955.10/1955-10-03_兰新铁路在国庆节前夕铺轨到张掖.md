    The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway had its tracks laid to Zhangye Station on September 30th, ahead of National Day. The original plan for laying 187 kilometers of track this year has been completed ahead of schedule. In carrying out this year's railway construction task, the railway workers overcame the difficulties of strong winds, sand, and scarce water sources brought about by the harsh climate of the Gobi Desert and grasslands. They built solid roadbeds in the areas of slush on the grasslands. Nail-laying factories and precast concrete bridge factories were established along the construction line, and mechanized and industrialized construction methods were used to build bridges and lay tracks, greatly accelerating the progress of the project.
    The section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to Zhangye has to pass through the natural barrier of the Yellow River and the Wushaoling Mountain, which is 3,000 meters above sea level, before entering the Hexi Corridor. After the railway passes through several Gobi Deserts and grasslands in the Hexi Corridor, it will reach the "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall," a place of abundant fields and rich products.
    Since the Lanzhou-Wuwei section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway opened to traffic in February this year, grain, salt, fur, medicinal materials, and various local and special products produced in this area have been continuously transported out. At present, the railway between Wuwei and Zhangye is being stepped up to lay tracks and ballast, and to build the necessary ancillary facilities for opening to traffic, in preparation for opening to traffic in the fourth quarter of this year. Large numbers of railway workers have successively entered the new construction site west of Zhangye, and new materials needed for the project have also been continuously transported in. It is estimated that by the end of this year, railway workers will lay an additional 104 kilometers of railway tracks west of Zhangye for the country. The original plan to open the railway to Yumen in 1957 can be realized ahead of schedule next year.

### 兰新铁路在国庆节前夕铺轨到张掖

    兰新铁路在国庆节前夕铺轨到张掖
    兰新铁路已经在九月三十日铺轨到张掖车站。今年原订铺轨一百八十七公里的计划，已提前完成。在执行今年筑路任务中，筑路职工克服了戈壁滩和草滩恶劣气候带来的风砂大、水源少的困难。在草滩上的翻浆地带修起了坚固的路基。在沿线工地上建立了钉道工厂和混凝土桥梁成品工厂，利用机械化、工厂化施工方法修桥和铺轨，大大加快了工程进度。
    兰新铁路到张掖这一段铁路要经过黄河天险和拔海三千公尺的乌鞘岭，然后才进入河西走廊。铁路在河西走廊上穿过几处戈壁滩和草滩后，就到田连阡陌，物产丰富的“塞外江南”了。
    自从今年二月兰新铁路兰州到武威段通车营业后，这一带出产的粮食、盐、皮毛、药材和各种土产特产品，已经源源外运。现在，武威到张掖间铁路正在加紧铺设股道和道碴，修筑通车所必需的附属设备，准备在今年第四季度通车营业。大队筑路职工陆续进入了张掖西面的新工地，新增加工程所需器材也已源源运到。预计今年年底筑路职工将在张掖以西为国家多铺一百零四公里的铁轨，原订一九五七年通车到玉门的计划，可在明年提前实现。
