To the Editor:

　　In the spring of 1953, our twelve households organized a temporary mutual aid team. After the establishment of the mutual aid team, we were able to seize the opportune moment in pest control, weeding, and fertilization, and we were also able to initially adopt some advanced techniques. As a result, everyone's production increased compared to when they were working individually, and their lives also improved. In the autumn of 1953, our team transitioned into a permanent mutual aid team.

　　Last year, our township suffered from a once-in-a-century flood disaster. The team members all said that to overcome the disaster, we had to establish a cooperative. However, the higher authorities said that our conditions were not sufficient and did not approve it. Some team members were dissatisfied. For example, team member Xie Huoxiang said, "We have been helping each other for several years, from temporary to permanent. The team's production is not bad, everyone has increased production, and the team members are all willing. Why isn't it approved? I don't know what is considered sufficient conditions?" I myself also had objections to the fact that the transition to a cooperative was not approved. Later, Comrade Cheng Jinjie, the Party branch secretary, educated me not to be discouraged and encouraged me to actively lead the mutual aid team and create the conditions for the transition to a cooperative.

　　This spring, the team members were again inquiring about the news of the transition to a cooperative, but there was no movement at all in the township, and everyone was very disappointed. It turned out that our township had established sixteen agricultural production cooperatives in 1953 and 1954. The team members had all personally witnessed the superiority of the agricultural production cooperatives. For example, our mutual aid team could never solve the problem of seizing the opportune moment during the "four quicks" of wheat harvesting, and there were always opinions about who should weed the cotton first; these were not problems in the cooperative. Furthermore, the crops in the cooperative were always stronger than our team's. Although we had secretly competed with the crops in the cooperative, we could never catch up. The Forward Fourth Cooperative near us had more than twenty bolls of cotton per plant this year, while our team only had more than ten bolls per plant. Judging from the situation, the cooperative's cotton production will increase by nearly double compared to ours.

　　This time, the comrades from the county committee conveyed to us the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the issue of agricultural cooperation. I was indescribably happy. After returning, I conveyed this to the team members, and everyone was very excited. Team member Xie Huoya said, "Chairman Mao in Beijing knew about our request to join the cooperative. We really want to thank him." At the meeting, the team members requested to write an application. Team member Xie Huoxiang was the first to sign up to join the cooperative. He said, "I have been eagerly awaiting the transition to a cooperative day and night, and now it has arrived!" Team members Xie Laiya and Xie Shuiya went back and held a family meeting, explaining the cooperative's policies and benefits to the elderly in their families. Hu Popo, who is over sixty years old in Xie Laiya's family, also signed up to join the cooperative. Individual farmer Xie Songya and others also wanted to join the cooperative. After careful discussion by the team, three individual farming households were admitted into the cooperative.

　　Now, we are about to transition to a cooperative. Accountant Xie Huoxiang has also returned from training in the county. We are making all the preparations for the transition to a cooperative: every night, we send team members to the old cooperatives to learn the "four appraisals," and we are also processing the accounts so that the accounts are clear before joining the cooperative. During the day, the male and female team members are busily picking cotton and selecting seeds in the cotton fields. They happily said in the fields: This year, we will select good cotton seeds, and next year, the cooperative will harvest good cotton.

    日夜望转社，现在望到了编辑同志：
    一九五三年春季，我们十二户人家组织了一个临时互助组。互助组成立后，在除虫、薅草、施肥工作中比较能抢住火色，同时还能初步地接受一些先进技术，因此大家都比单干的时候增了产，生活也有了提高。一九五三年秋季，我们组就转为常年互助组。
    去年我乡遭受了百年未有的大水灾害，组员们都说要战胜灾荒，只有成立合作社。但是上级说我们条件不够，没有批准。有些组员就感到不满意。如组员谢火祥说：“我们互助了好几年，由临时转成了常年，组里生产搞得也不坏，家家都增了产，组员又都愿意，为什么不批准？不晓得要怎么样才算够条件？”我自己对没有批准转社这件事也有意见。后来党支部书记程金阶同志就教育我不要灰心丧气，鼓励我积极把互助组领导起来，创造转社条件。
    今年春天，组员又在打听着转社的消息，但是乡里没有半点动静，大家都感到大失所望。原来我们乡里在一九五三年和一九五四年先后办了十六个农业生产合作社，组员们都亲眼看到了农业生产合作社的优越性。像我们互助组在麦收“四快”中抢火色的问题始终不能得到解决，薅棉花谁先谁后总有意见；这些在社里都不成问题了。再说社里的庄稼块块比我们组的强，我们虽然也曾在暗地里和社里的庄稼比赛，但始终是赶不上。我们附近的前进第四社今年的棉花每棵有二十多个桃，我们组内的每棵只有十多个桃，看情况社里的棉花要比我们增产将近一倍。
    这次县委会的同志向我们传达了中共中央关于农业合作化问题的指示，我心里有说不出来的高兴。回来后我向组员们作了传达，大家都兴奋得很。组员谢火伢说：“毛主席在北京晓得了我们入社的要求，我们真要感谢他老人家。”在会上组员们就提出要求写申请书。组员谢火祥第一个报名入社，他说：“日夜望转社，现在可望到了！”组员谢来伢和谢水伢回去召开了家庭会议，把合作社的政策和好处向家里的老年人讲解。谢来伢家中六十多岁的胡婆婆也报名入社了。单干户谢松伢等也要来参加社，经过组里慎重讨论，共吸收了三户单干农民入社。
    现在，我们快要转社了，会计谢火祥到县里受训也回来了。我们正在作转社的一切准备工作：每天晚上派组员到老社去学习“四评”，另外还在处理账目，以便在入社之前把账搞得一清二楚。白天里，男女组员们正紧张地在棉地里拣花和选种。他们在地里高兴地说：今年选得好棉种，明年社里收好花。
