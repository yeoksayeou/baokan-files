    Strengthen the Supply of Non-Standard Equipment
    Luo Ke
    Among all the machinery and equipment of newly built factories and mines, the majority are standard equipment, that is, manufactured by factories according to established types and sizes. For this part of the equipment, it is only necessary to place an order with the relevant manufacturing factories. The other part of the equipment is called non-standard equipment. This part of the equipment needs to be specially designed and manufactured separately; and under the current situation of China's low technical level and many projects being designed by foreign countries, most of the time, we still need the Soviet Union or other brother countries to help us provide the technical data needed for design, or even directly supply drawings. This part of the equipment also accounts for a considerable proportion of all equipment. For example, non-standard equipment accounts for 19 percent of the equipment to be installed by the First Ministry of Machine Building this year. In some types of equipment, the proportion of non-standard equipment is even greater. For example, 40 percent of various tanks and vessels are non-standard equipment, and 20 percent of various hoisting and transportation equipment are non-standard equipment. Therefore, to ensure the completion of basic construction tasks, it is very important to supply non-standard equipment on time according to plan.
    However, at present, there is a general tendency to neglect non-standard equipment in basic construction work, and there are many problems in the supply of non-standard equipment.
    Some construction units only pay attention to standard equipment and neglect non-standard equipment. They believe that non-standard equipment has many varieties, small quantities, and great difficulties, and has little impact on the plan. Therefore, they have relaxed their work in this area, not studying what problems there are in this work, and not assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible for managing this part of the work, or having dedicated personnel to manage it, but not organizing various management tasks. The non-standard equipment drawings of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant were supplied by the Soviet Union. These drawings arrived long ago, but the plant did not organize people to translate and copy them in time. In the first half of this year, they ordered a batch of non-standard equipment from Dalian Universal Machinery Factory, requiring delivery in September; until now, the drawings have not been completely handed over to Dalian Universal Machinery Factory. At the same time, they do not review the drawings before handing them over to the manufacturing factory, resulting in contradictions between the general drawing and the component drawing or incomplete drawings being discovered during the manufacturing process, and production has to be suspended. During the manufacturing process, they do not respond in time to some technical issues raised by the manufacturing factory, such as whether alternative materials can be used. Because not enough attention is paid to non-standard equipment, orders are often omitted when placing orders, and additional orders have to be placed afterwards. All these seriously delay the delivery time of non-standard equipment.
    Some manufacturing factories do not carefully consider their own technical capabilities when accepting orders, and some accept orders for things they cannot manufacture. In particular, they rarely consider their own design capabilities and rely on the construction units, feeling that the construction units will always solve the drawing problems. As a result, they find that they cannot do it when the time comes, and have to propose that foreign countries manufacture or supply drawings. Although some manufacturing factories have some difficulties in manufacturing, they can undertake the design and manufacturing with effort. They even adopt an attitude of evasion and procrastination. This naturally delays the delivery and installation time.
    At present, most non-standard equipment is manufactured domestically; some accessories, instruments, and special materials still need to be supplied from abroad. Because the requirements for non-standard equipment are put forward late, the drawings are handed out late, and the construction units and manufacturing factories delay for a period of time in signing agreements. By the time the manufacturing factories get the drawings, they find that they still have to order accessories, instruments, and materials from abroad, but time is very tight. Therefore, this part of the order often cannot meet the needs and has become an important factor in the failure to deliver non-standard equipment on time.
    There are also some manufacturing factories that dislike non-standard equipment because of the many varieties, small quantities, small output value, unskilled workers, and troublesome preparation work. Therefore, they are unwilling to accept orders for non-standard equipment. Even if they undertake it, they treat it as a secondary order. In order to complete the total output value plan, they would rather make more standard products that are not very needed than complete the manufacturing tasks of non-standard equipment on schedule. Moreover, the national regulations do not provide enough support for this part of the product. For example, this part of the product is not controlled in the national plan, but only listed in the "other" item of the enterprise product plan, and is not regarded as a formal task; when examining the completion of the variety plan, it is also impossible to check whether this part of the plan has been completed well or badly. At present, most of the non-standard equipment is needed for the 156 key projects. This kind of treatment received by non-standard equipment is obviously extremely disproportionate to the importance of these key projects. In particular, non-standard equipment often needs to be completed by the collaboration of several factories, and this kind of collaborative parts is even less valued. Originally, the state stipulated that the manufacturing factories must give priority to manufacturing orders for the 156 key projects; however, the collaborative parts of these orders do not receive this priority, and as a result, the entire machine still cannot be completed as a set on time. In non-standard equipment, more than one-third is undertaken by local state-owned factories, but the national material allocation agencies only consider the economic type of the enterprise when allocating raw materials, regardless of the importance of the products it manufactures, and often place the raw materials needed for these equipment in a secondary position, so that this part of the equipment cannot be completed on time.
    In addition, some collaborative parts, especially electrical accessories, often cause non-standard equipment to not be supplied in time due to weak manufacturing strength and inability to meet requirements.
    Due to these many problems in the supply of non-standard equipment, the failure to supply non-standard equipment in time has become one of the keys affecting the failure to complete the basic construction plan on schedule. For example, due to the failure to supply non-standard equipment in time, about one-fourth of the installation plan of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in the fourth quarter of this year cannot be completed on schedule; especially the foundry workshop, which will therefore not be able to carry out production adjustments in time. Because some non-standard equipment of Harbin Instrument Factory cannot be delivered for installation in time, it will affect a part of the factory's production cannot be carried out on time; and will also affect the task of making collaborative products for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. Shanghai Turbine Factory has installed all kinds of standard equipment, but one non-standard equipment has not arrived, resulting in a delay of fifteen days in trial production.
    The above-mentioned serious situation shows that improving the supply of non-standard equipment is urgent. To this end, we must immediately correct the idea of ​​not paying attention to non-standard equipment in construction units and manufacturing factories, and quickly take the following measures:
    First, the construction unit should strengthen the organization and management of non-standard equipment and regard it as the focus of the current entire equipment supply work. Designate dedicated personnel to be responsible for managing standard equipment; study the design requirements in detail, and put forward the order for non-standard equipment as a set to avoid omissions; organize the translation and reproduction of drawings in a planned way and in order of priority, and hand them over to the manufacturing factory as a set; strengthen contact with the manufacturing factory, and respond quickly to the technical issues raised by the manufacturing factory, and strengthen the inspection work during the manufacturing process.
    Second, before accepting orders, each manufacturing factory must carefully consider its own technical conditions, especially its design capabilities. If it cannot design by itself, it should propose to the Soviet Union or other brother countries to help provide technical data or drawings as soon as possible. Which accessories, instruments, and special materials need to be supplied from abroad should also be studied and determined as soon as possible. On the other hand, it should vigorously overcome difficulties, enhance design strength, and accept non-standard equipment orders as much as possible. At the same time, it should strengthen production organization and technical guidance and inspection during the manufacturing process to ensure product quality and on-time delivery. Factories undertaking collaborative products should guarantee on-time delivery so that factories manufacturing non-standard equipment can deliver them as a set on time.
    Third, the state and relevant leading organs should stipulate necessary systems to support the manufacturing of non-standard equipment. Non-standard equipment and collaborative products of important projects should be included in the enterprise's production plan to ensure completion on schedule. The leading organs should strictly inspect and provide technical guidance. The materials needed for non-standard equipment manufactured by local state-owned or private factories for important projects should be allocated.
    Fourth, in order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient design strength for non-standard equipment, the existing design drawings of non-standard equipment of various construction units and factory design departments should be compiled into design directories by category and distributed to various units for mutual exchange and selection. The design departments of basic construction should also pay attention to selecting the types that can be manufactured in our country when designing, to avoid being unconventional and increasing the difficulty of product design.
    Fifth, organize specialized non-standard equipment manufacturing factories. Now the First Ministry of Machine Building and other relevant departments have begun to organize three types of non-standard equipment manufacturing factories in the existing state-owned, local state-owned and private factories: foundry, mechanized transportation, and power systems (such as boiler rooms, gas stations, various high-pressure valves, etc.). This will not only allow the complete manufacturing of non-standard equipment but also better ensure quality, reduce costs, and ensure on-time delivery.
    Next year, the installation tasks in basic construction will be more arduous, and improving the supply of non-standard equipment is of greater significance to ensuring the completion of the basic construction plan in 1956. All construction units and manufacturing factories must fully attach importance to this work and do it well.

    加强非标准设备的供应工作
    洛克
    在新建厂矿的全部机器设备当中，大部分是标准设备，即工厂按照既定的型式、尺寸制造的。这部分设备，只要向有关的制造工厂提出订货就行了。另一部分设备，叫做非标准设备。这部分设备需要专门设计，单独制造；而在我国目前技术水平不高、很多工程是由国外设计的情况下，多半还需要苏联或其他兄弟国家帮助我们提供设计所需要的技术资料，甚至直接供应图纸。这部分设备在全部设备中也占有相当的比重。例如第一机械工业部今年需要安装的设备中，非标准设备就占到百分之十九。在有些种类的设备中，非标准设备所占的比重更大。如各种槽和罐中就有百分之四十是非标准设备，各种起重运输设备中，有百分之二十是非标准设备。因此，要保证基本建设任务的完成，按照计划及时地供应非标准设备，是一件非常重要的工作。
    但是，目前在基本建设工作中普遍有忽视非标准设备的倾向，非标准设备的供应工作中有不少问题。
    有些建设单位只重视标准设备，不重视非标准设备。他们认为非标准设备品种多、数量少、困难大，对计划的影响小，因而放松了这方面的工作，不研究这项工作中有什么问题，也不分配专人去负责管理这部分工作或有专人管理，但没有把各项管理工作组织起来。第一汽车制造厂的非标准设备图纸是苏联供给的，这些图纸早已到了，但是厂里没有组织人及时地翻译、复制出来。他们在今年上半年向大连通用机器厂订制一批非标准设备，要求九月交货；直到现在还没有把图纸完全交给大连通用机器厂。同时，把图纸交给承制工厂以前，也不审查，结果在制造过程中发现总图同部件图有矛盾或者图纸不全，不得不中止生产。在制造过程中，承制工厂提出一些技术上的问题，如能否使用代用材料等，他们也不及时答复。因为对非标准设备注意不够，提出订货的时候常有遗漏，事后又要补订。这些都严重地拖延了非标准设备的交付时间。
    有些承制工厂在接受订货的时候不很好地考虑自己的技术能力，有些不能制造的也承应了下来。特别是对于自己的设计能力很少考虑，对建设单位抱着依赖思想，觉得建设单位总要解决图纸问题的，结果事到临头才发现自己干不了，只得又提出请国外制造或由国外供应图纸。有些承制厂虽然在承制上有些困难，但是只要努力是可以承担设计和制造的，他们竟也采取了推却，拖延的态度。这样自然就耽误了交付安装的时间。
    现在一般的非标准设备都由国内制造；有一些配件、仪表和特殊材料还需要国外供应。由于对非标准设备的要求提出得迟，图纸交出得晚，建设单位和承制工厂签订协议又拖延一段时间，等到承制工厂把图纸拿到手，发现还得向国外订购配件、仪表、材料，时间却很紧迫了。因此这部分订货常常赶不上需要，也成为非标准设备不能按时交货的重要因素。
    还有一些承制工厂嫌非标准设备种类多、数量少、产值小，工人不熟练，准备工作麻烦，因此不愿意接受非标准设备的订货。即使承制了，也把它当作次要订货。他们为了完成总产值计划，宁愿多做不很需要的标准产品，也不按期完成非标准设备的制造任务。而且，国家规定的制度，对这部分产品的支持也不够。例如，国家计划中对这部分产品没有控制，只把它列入企业产品计划的“其他”项目中，不作为正规任务；考察品种计划的完成情况的时候，也检查不出来这部分计划完成得好坏。现在一般的非标准设备，绝大部分都是一百五十六项重点工程所需要的。非标准设备所受到的这种待遇显然同这些重点工程的重要性是极不相称的。特别是非标准设备常常要几个工厂协作完成，这种协作部件更得不到重视。本来国家规定一百五十六项重点工程的订货，承制工厂必须尽先制造；但是这些订货的协作部件得不到这种优先权，结果影响整个机器仍然不能成套地按时完成。在非标准设备中，有三分之一以上是地方国营工厂承制的，但是国家的物资分配机关在分配原材料的时候，只考虑企业的经济类型，而不问它所制造的产品的重要性如何，常常把这些设备所需要的原材料放在次要的地位，以致影响了这部分设备不能按时完成。
    此外，还有些协作部件，尤其是电器配件，由于制造力量薄弱，不能满足要求，也常常造成非标准设备不能及时供应。
    由于非标准设备供应工作中有这许多问题，现在非标准设备不能及时供应已经成为影响基本建设计划不能按期完成的关键之一。例如第一汽车制造厂因为非标准设备不能及时供应，今年第四季度的安装计划约有四分之一左右不能按时完成；特别是铸工车间，将因此不能及时进行生产调整。哈尔滨仪表厂因为部分非标准设备不能及时交付安装，将影响工厂的一部分生产不能按时进行；从而也将影响到给第一汽车制造厂制作协作产品的任务。上海汽轮机厂各种标准设备都安装好了，但有一台非标准设备没有到，结果使试生产拖迟了十五天。
    上述的严重情况说明，改善非标准设备的供应工作，是刻不容缓的了。为此，必须立即纠正建设单位和承制工厂中不重视非标准设备的思想，并迅速采取下列一些措施：
    第一、建设单位要加强非标准设备的组织管理工作，把它当作当前整个设备供应工作的重点来掌握。要指定专人负责管理标准设备；详细研究设计要求，成套地提出非标准设备的订货，避免遗漏；要有计划地、分先后缓急组织图纸的翻译复制工作，成套地交给承制厂；要加强同承制厂的联系，承制厂提出的技术问题，要迅速答复，并要加强制造过程中的检查工作。
    第二、各个承制厂在接受订货以前，一方面，必须慎重考虑自己的技术条件，特别是设计能力。如果自己不能设计，要及早提出请苏联或其他兄弟国家帮助提供技术资料或图纸。哪些配件、仪表、特殊材料需要国外供应，也要及早研究确定。另一方面，应大力克服困难，增强设计力量，尽可能地承接非标准设备订货。同时，应该加强生产组织工作和制造过程中的技术指导和检查工作，确保产品质量和按时交货，承担协作产品的厂应保证按时交货，以便承制非标准设备的厂能够成套地按时交货。
    第三、国家和有关的领导机关要规定必要的制度来支持非标准设备的制造工作。重要工程的非标准设备和协作产品，都要列入企业的生产计划，保证按期完成。领导机关要严加检查并给以技术上的指导。地方国营或私营工厂承制重要工程的非标准设备所需要的材料应该予以调配。
    第四、为了克服非标准设备的设计力量不足的困难，对各建设单位和工厂设计部门现有的非标准设备设计图纸，要分门别类编成设计目录，分发各单位互相交流和选用。基本建设的设计部门在设计时也应注意选用我国现在已能制造的型式，避免标新立异，增加产品设计的困难。
    第五、要组织专门的非标准设备制造厂。现在第一机械工业部等有关部门已着手在现有的国营、地方国营和私营工厂中，组织铸工、机械化运输和动力系统（如锅炉房、煤气站、各种高压阀门等）三类非标准设备制造厂。这样不但可以成套地制造非标准设备，而且能更好地保证质量、降低成本和保证按期交货。
    明年基本建设中的安装任务将愈加繁重了，改善非标准设备的供应工作对保证完成一九五六年的基本建设计划有更重要的意义。各个建设单位和承制工厂必须充分重视这件工作，把它做好。
