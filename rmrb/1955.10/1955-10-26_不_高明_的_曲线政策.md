Title: The Not-So-"Clever" "Curve Policy"

The strong anti-colonial sentiment displayed by Asian and African countries at the Tenth United Nations General Assembly has caused Thomas Hamilton, a reporter for "The New York Times," to exclaim in alarm: "The anti-colonial bloc is becoming bolder and bolder."

This alarm is not without reason. In the current situation at the United Nations General Assembly, the United States, which has always portrayed itself as an anti-colonial hero, is facing a real test.

In a dispatch entitled "Colonial Issues Open New Rifts in the United Nations, United States in Difficult Position," Hamilton admitted that the reason the United States is in a "difficult" situation is that on the one hand, it cannot but stand on the common ground of the colonialists, "supporting its colonial allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," and on the other hand, it wants to conceal this position and "win friends in Asia and the Arab countries." In order to get rid of this "dilemma," according to Hamilton, the United States has adopted a "clever curve policy."

Hamilton cited the following as examples of this so-called "clever curve policy": "On the Algerian issue, the United States voted the same way as France... but Mr. Lodge gave such a cold speech." It is said that it was entirely thanks to Mr. Lodge's "cold speech" that "some representatives who would normally have voted the same way as the United States voted differently." In other words, the United States seems to have pleased both sides this time.

What Hamilton was particularly "impressed" with was that the United States supported Britain on the Cyprus issue and abstained on the West Irian issue, "hoping that this would not encounter so much opposition from Asian and Arab countries." But this made the Netherlands "very annoyed." Therefore, Hamilton quickly explained that the General Assembly's discussion of the West Irian issue "was not entirely due to the United States' lack of support for the Netherlands."

Despite how much Hamilton spoke well of the United States, the fact is that on the issues of Algeria, Cyprus, and West Irian, the United States either voted in favor of the colonial powers or abstained, which means it did not support the anti-colonial countries. If this so-called "curve policy" has any "cleverness," it is that it makes many anti-colonial countries see that the United States is hostile to the "Bandung Spirit," and it makes some other countries see that there is no benefit in following the United States completely, and that they must make their own decisions. This is the real reason for Hamilton's alarmed cry.

Doris Fleeson, a reporter for "The New York Post," was obviously more honest than Hamilton. He admitted that those colonial countries are all "old friends" of the United States, and the United States rules the colonies together with them. Fleeson said, "Huge American strategic air bases – from which nuclear bombs can be launched against the Soviet Union… Most of these American bases are on the territory of so-called imperialist countries, including Britain and France. In fact, the main bases are in the colonies." Fleeson believes that this is the reason why the United States supports colonial countries.

Of course, Fleeson did not tell the whole truth about the United States' efforts to maintain colonialism. But just what Fleeson admitted is enough to make people understand why the United States wants to obstruct and suppress the struggle of colonial people for independence and freedom. This also explains why the United States even uses force to support the colonial countries' suppression operations in North Africa. (Dan)

### 不“高明”的“曲线政策”

    不“高明”的“曲线政策”
    第十届联合国大会上亚非国家所表现的强烈的反殖民主义情绪，使得“纽约时报”的记者托马斯·汉密尔顿惊慌地叫道：“反殖民主义集团的胆量越来越大了”。
    这种惊慌并不是没有来由的。在联合国大会目前的情况下面，一向把自己装成反殖民主义英雄的美国，受到了真正的考验。
    汉密尔顿在一篇题为“殖民地问题在联合国中打开了新的裂痕，美国处于困难的境地”的电讯里承认，美国之所以陷于“困难”的境地，是因为它一方面不能不站在殖民主义者的共同立场上，“支持它在北大西洋公约组织中的拥有殖民地的盟国”，另一方面又想掩饰自己的这种立场，“要在亚洲和阿拉伯国家中争取朋友”。为了摆脱这种“左右为难”的困境，据汉密尔顿说，美国采取了一项“高明的曲线政策”。
    汉密尔顿为这种所谓“高明的曲线政策”举例说：“在阿尔及利亚问题上，美国同法国投一样的票……，但是洛奇先生发表了如此冷淡的演说”。据说，全靠着洛奇先生的这一场“冷淡的演说”，才使得“有些在正常情况下完全同美国投一样的票的代表投了不同的票”。换句话说，美国这下子似乎做到了两面讨好。
    使得汉密尔顿尤为“倾倒”的是美国在塞浦路斯问题上支持英国，而在西伊里安问题上弃权，“希望这样不会遭到亚洲和阿拉伯国家那么大的反对”。但是这使荷兰“非常恼怒”。因此汉密尔顿赶紧解释说，大会通过讨论西伊里安问题“并不完全由于美国不支持荷兰”。
    尽管汉密尔顿给美国说了多少好话，事实是美国在阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯、西伊里安这几个问题上不是投票支持殖民国家就是弃权，也就是不支持反对殖民主义的国家。这种所谓“曲线政策”如果有任何“高明”之处，那就是它使许多反殖民主义国家看到美国敌视“万隆精神”，使另外有些国家看到完全跟美国走没有好处，而要自己打主意。这也就是汉密尔顿惊慌叫喊的真正原因。
    “纽约邮报”的记者道里斯·弗里逊显然比汉密尔顿要老实些。他承认那些殖民国家都是美国的“老朋友”，美国同它们一起统治着殖民地。弗里逊说，“巨大的美国战略空军基地——从这些基地上可以对苏联发射核子炸弹。……这些美国基地大部分是在所谓帝国主义国家，包括英国和法国在内的领土之上，事实上，主要的基地是在殖民地。”弗里逊认为，这就是美国支持殖民国家的原因。
    当然，弗里逊并没有说出美国竭尽心力要保持殖民主义的全部真相。但是仅仅弗里逊所承认的这一点，也足以使人们了解，美国为什么要阻挠和镇压殖民地人民争取独立自由的斗争。这也说明了为什么美国甚至要用武力来支持殖民国家在北非的镇压行动。（丹）
