Swiss People Warmly Welcome Chinese Drama
Zhao Feng

The public in the Swiss Confederation warmly welcomes Chinese classical drama. The tour performances of the Chinese Art Troupe in the five major cities of Basel, Zurich, Geneva, Lausanne, and Bern have become a major event in Swiss cultural life. Many people called, wrote letters, or personally went to the Consulate General of the People's Republic of China in Geneva to express their thanks. Many sent flowers and sweets to the hotels where the Chinese Art Troupe stayed. Many shop assistants warmly congratulated the members of the Chinese Art Troupe when they bought odds and ends. After the shows, many people waved to the Chinese artists on the sidewalks (in Basel, hundreds of spectators cheered "Mao Zedong" along the way). People said these were unforgettable and beautiful performances, and some said they were the best dramas they had ever seen in their lives. The "Journal de Genève" said: "Such a great event can only be encountered a few times in a person's life."

Swiss critics pointed out that the comprehensive form of Chinese classical drama, which combines singing, dancing, poetry, and music, is an excellent form of artistic expression. It is different from Western opera, where the actors only sing, while the actors should be performing masters who can sing and dance, people with all-round talents. The "Tages-Anzeiger" of Zurich said: "In Chinese classical drama, there is no distance between music and dance, and no difference between singing and speaking. This is an ideal comprehensive drama." The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" reported: "Here are gorgeous colors, highly detailed dances, thrilling and even breathtaking martial arts, all like in a dream." The "Journal de Genève," "Neue Zürcher Zeitung," "Basler Arbeiter-Zeitung," "Feuille d'avis de Lausanne," and others all unanimously pointed out that Chinese classical drama will have a significant impact on Western European dramatic art, predicting that this unique comprehensive dramatic form of Chinese classical drama will provide beneficial inspiration to Western dramatic styles - from scriptwriting to stage art.

The Swiss public opinion unanimously praised the profound popularity of Chinese classical drama. "Zürcher Zeitung" said: "Chinese classical drama is not only the work of artists, but also the cause of national culture." "Journal de Genève's Workers' Voice" said: "Chinese classical drama is traditional and also realistic. It is traditional because it has a long tradition of several centuries, and it has created a series of programs and symbolic forms; it is realistic because it is closely related to people's lives, making us feel that it is real, possible, close to our hearts, and beautified in an incomparable style."

Swiss drama critics further pointed out the great significance of the stylized and formalized characteristics of Chinese classical drama. "Lausanne Gazette" said: "Chinese classical drama organizes dance, singing, recitation, performance, and superb martial arts into a form, making it reach a high degree of perfection in expressing objects and emotions. The characteristic of this art lies in unifying two seemingly irreconcilable factors, namely reality and symbolism. Realism lies in its ability to accurately express the truth, while stylized, formalized, and canonical movements require that every finger movement have a precise meaning." "Journal de Genève" said: "This is an art that advocates form (in the good sense of the word form, we Western art is losing this aspect), but if we cannot constantly give these forms life and conquer it with all our heart, this form will become dead and boring. Chinese classical drama, on the other hand, is to beautify, strengthen, and exaggerate our daily movements and present them on the stage."

The Chinese Art Troupe's tour performances in Switzerland have begun a new stage in the cultural relations between the Swiss and Chinese people. Political leaders of the Swiss Confederation, the Canton of Basel, the Canton of Zurich, the City of Zurich, the Canton of Geneva, the City of Geneva, the Canton of Lausanne, the City of Lausanne, the Canton of Bern... have all made friendly contact with the leaders of the Chinese Art Troupe. They all mentioned the great significance of strengthening cultural relations between people of all countries to the cause of world peace. The cultural and artistic circles of Switzerland also had friendly meetings with the actors and musicians of the Chinese Art Troupe. As the "Journal de Genève's Workers' Voice" pointed out, "The special greatness of this meeting lies in the establishment of contact between us and China, which is so distant and mysterious to our people. People only know that there is a highly developed ancient culture and a great people, but in addition, they know almost nothing or can only understand it through some dubious books."

    瑞士人民热烈欢迎中国戏剧
    赵沨
    瑞士联邦的公众热烈地欢迎中国古典戏剧，中国艺术团在瑞士巴塞尔、苏黎世、日内瓦、洛桑、伯尔尼五大城市的旅行演出，成了瑞士文化生活中的一件大事。许多人打电话、写信或亲自到中华人民共和国驻日内瓦总领事馆道谢，许多人送花、送糖果到中国艺术团住的旅馆，许多商店的店员在中国艺术团的团员们购买零星用品时热情地祝贺，散戏后许多人在人行道上向中国艺术家招手（在巴塞尔，几百观众夹道欢呼“毛泽东”）。人们说这是难忘的美丽的演出，有人说是一生中所看到的最好的戏剧。“日内瓦报”说：“这样的大事在一个人的一生中只能遇到少数三五次而已。”
    瑞士的评论家指出中国古典戏剧这一熔合歌、舞、诗、乐于一炉的综合形式，是一种卓越的艺术表现形式。它和西方歌剧中的演员只有唱的情形不同，而演员应是一些能歌善舞的表演大师，是些全材的人。苏黎世的“事实报”说：“中国古典戏剧中音乐和舞蹈没有距离，唱歌和说话没有区别，这是一种理想的综合戏剧。”“新苏黎世报”新闻说：“这里显现了华丽的色彩，高度细致的舞蹈，惊险以至令人瞠目结舌、屏息凝神的武功，一切都像在梦中一样。”“日内瓦报”、“新苏黎世报”、“巴塞尔工人之声报”、“洛桑舆论报”等都一致指出中国古典戏剧将对西欧戏剧艺术发生重大的影响，预言着中国古典戏剧特有的这种综合性的戏剧形式定将对西方戏剧风格——从编剧到舞台美术——以有益的启示。
    瑞士的舆论界对中国古典戏剧的深厚的人民性予以一致的赞美。“苏黎世报”说：“中国古典戏剧不仅是艺术家的工作，也是民族文化的事业。”“日内瓦工人之声报”说：“中国古典戏剧是传统的，也是现实的。说它是传统的，因为它有着若干世纪的悠久传统，它创造了一系列的程式和象征形式；说它是现实的，因为它是与人民生活密切联系着的，使我们感觉到这是真的、可能的、贴近我们身心的，而又是用一种不可比拟的风格美化起来的。”
    瑞士的戏剧评论家更指出中国古典戏剧风格化、程式化的特点的重大意义。“洛桑日报”说：“中国古典戏把舞蹈、歌唱、朗诵、表演、卓绝的武功组织在一个形式之中，使之达到了表达物象和情操的高度完美的地步。这种艺术的特色在于把两种似乎不可调和的因素即现实性和象征性统一起来。现实主义在于它能确切地表现真实，而定型的、程式的、典范化的动作却又要求每一个手指的动作都得具有精确的含义。”“日内瓦报”说：“这是一种崇尚形式的艺术（在形式这个字的好的含义上，我们西方艺术正在失去这一方面），但如果不能不断地给予这些形式以生命，并用全身心的力量去征服它，这种形式一定会变成死的，枯燥乏味的。而中国古典戏剧，则正是把我们日常的动作美化、强化、夸张之后，陈现于舞台之上。”
    中国艺术团在瑞士的旅行演出，开始了瑞士和中国人民之间文化关系的新的阶段。瑞士联邦、巴塞尔州、苏黎世州、苏黎世市、日内瓦州、日内瓦市、洛桑州、洛桑市、伯尔尼州……的政治领袖们都和中国艺术团的领导人员作了友好的接触。他们都提及加强世界各国人民文化关系对世界和平事业的重大意义。瑞士的文化艺术界也和中国艺术团的演员、音乐家们作了友谊的会见。正如“日内瓦工人之声报”指出的，“这个会见的特别伟大在于它建立了我们和中国之间的接触，而中国对我们人民说来是那末遥远和神秘，人们只知道那里有着高度发展的古老文化和伟大人民，但此外差不多完全不了解或者只能通过一些令人怀疑的书籍去认识。”
