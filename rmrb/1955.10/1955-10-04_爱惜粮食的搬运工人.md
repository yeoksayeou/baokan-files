On the Xiang River, a large number of ships laden with rice from the Dongting Lake area sail to the Changsha City docks every day. As soon as the ships dock, the dockworkers, carrying sacks and brooms, jump aboard. They fill the sacks with rice from the hold, carry them to the dock, then load them onto flatbed carts and transport them to various warehouses or grain processing factories in Changsha City.

More than 3,000 dockworkers in Changsha City transport seven to eight thousand tons of rice every day. They try every means to avoid spilling grain. When loading sacks on the ships, they usually use brooms to sweep off the grain sticking to the sacks, to prevent it from falling on the road. After the grain is put into the sacks, they tie the sack openings tightly. In the process of transporting grain, some rice always ends up in the dockworkers' pockets every day. At the end of the shift, the dockworkers check their pockets themselves and send the rice that has fallen into their pockets to the warehouse. If someone occasionally forgets to check, others will remind them.

The second team of the dockworkers, in order to prevent the rice stuck to the sacks from falling on the ground, ties a piece of sackcloth under the flatbed carts, so that the rice stuck to the grain sacks falls inside. The sackcloth tied to each flatbed cart can hold an average of two or three liang of rice every day. Now, this method has been promoted in various dockworker teams. The twelfth team of the dockworkers is made up of young lads. In the past, they were greedy for quantity and speed. When loading rice in the hold, they always liked to fill the sacks to the brim. As a result, a lot of rice often flowed out of the sack openings, hit the ship's planks, and rolled into the river. Later, they examined this shortcoming and changed the way they loaded rice, and the phenomenon of spilling grain has been corrected. One day, near the end of the shift, it suddenly started to rain, and the dockworkers rushed home. After dockworker Yang Boxiang of the sixth team got home, he remembered the sacks he had brought home. Because he had originally planned to load more grain, the grains in the bags had not been shaken out. That night, he shook out all the rice from the bags and sent it to the warehouse.

In previous years, dockworkers did not pay attention to cherishing grain, and a lot of rice was spilled during the transportation of grain. There were often piles of rice on the docks, and sparrows often flew in flocks to eat it. Every day, more than a dozen adults and children would sweep up grain on the docks. There was also often spilt rice on the road from the docks to the warehouses.

This year, the situation here is very different. The dockworkers understand the meaning of cherishing grain. They believe that spilling less grain is adding a bit of strength to national construction; not wasting grain is being worthy of our farmer brothers. Now, it is difficult to see spilled grain on the docks and roads; if there is any grain spilled on the ground, the dockworkers always sweep and sweep again, picking and picking again, striving to send every grain of rice into the state grain warehouse.

    爱惜粮食的搬运工人
    永镕　天钧
    湘江上，现在每天都有大批满载着稻谷的船只，从洞庭湖地区驶向长沙市码头。船一靠岸，搬运工人们就背着麻袋，拿着扫帚，跳上船去。他们把满舱的稻谷装进麻袋，运上码头，然后改装板车，运到长沙市各仓库或粮食加工厂去。
    长沙市三千多名搬运工人，每天要搬运七八千吨稻谷。他们想尽一切办法，不抛撒谷子。他们在船上装麻袋的时候，一般都要用扫帚把麻袋上沾着的谷子扫下来，以免稻谷落在路上。谷子装入麻袋以后，他们就把麻袋口子紧紧地扎好。工人们在搬运粮食的过程中，每天总会有一些稻谷落在衣服口袋里。散工时，搬运工人们自己都把衣服口袋检查一遍，把落在口袋里的稻谷送进仓库。有人偶尔忘记了检查，别人就提醒他。
    搬运队第二分队，为了不让沾在麻袋上的稻谷掉在地上，在板车下系上一块麻袋，使装粮麻袋上沾着的稻谷掉在里面。每辆板车上系的麻袋里，每天平均能装上二三两稻谷。现在，这个办法已经在各个搬运队里推广了。搬运队第十二分队里都是些年轻小伙子。过去他们贪多图快，在船舱里装稻谷的时候，总喜欢把麻袋盛得满满的，结果常有许多稻谷从麻袋口流出来，打在船板上，滚到河里去。后来，他们检查了这个缺点，改变了装稻谷的方法，撒谷的现象已经纠正。有一天，将近收工的时候，突然下起雨来，搬运工人们都纷纷赶回家去。搬运队第六分队工人杨伯香到家以后，想起他带回家的那些麻袋，因为原来准备还要装谷，袋子里的谷粒还没有抖干净，他在当天晚上就把麻袋里的稻谷全部抖下来，送到仓库里去。
    往年，搬运工人们不注意爱惜粮食，在搬运粮食的过程中抛撒的稻谷很多。码头上常有一堆堆的稻谷，麻雀经常成群地飞来吃。到码头上扫粮食的大人、小孩，每天总有十几个。从码头到仓库的路上，也经常有撒落的稻谷。
    今年，这里的情况大不相同了。搬运工人们懂得了爱惜粮食的意义。他们认为，少抛撒一粒粮食，就是为国家建设增加一分力量；不浪费粮食，才对得住农民兄弟。现在，在码头上、路途中，已经很难看到撒落的粮食；偶尔有粮食撒在地上，搬运工人们也总是扫了又扫，拣了又拣，争取把颗颗稻谷送进国家粮食仓库。
