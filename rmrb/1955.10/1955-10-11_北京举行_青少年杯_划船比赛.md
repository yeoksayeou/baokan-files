    北京举行“青少年杯”划船比赛
    北京市在九日举行了一九五五年学生“青少年杯”划船运动比赛会。五十二个大、中、小学的一千多名男、女运动员在北京市后海水上运动站进行了青年舢舨、少年舢舨、单人竞赛艇等项目的比赛。
    比赛结果是：北京市第三中学第二小队和北京市第四女子中学舢舨队分别获得青年舢舨男、女组冠军。北京市第七中学第一小队和北京市第四十中学第一小队分别获得少年舢舨男、女组冠军。单人竞赛艇男、女冠军分别由北京市第七中学刘文起和北京师范大学附属女子中学王瑞泉获得。
    这次夺杯竞赛是北京市第一次规模较大的划船运动比赛。凡是连续三次获得青、少年舢舨冠军的队，可以永远保持青、少年杯获得者的荣誉。（新华社）
