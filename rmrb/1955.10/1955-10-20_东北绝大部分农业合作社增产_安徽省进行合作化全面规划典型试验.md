Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch: The more than 90,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe have mostly achieved increased production. Among the more than 23,800 cooperatives established in Heilongjiang Province before this spring, about 95% have achieved increased production. Of the 757 cooperatives in Hulan County, 732 cooperatives increased production by 10% to 40% compared to local mutual aid teams. In the 10th district of Huachuan County, which has already been cooperativized, the yield of 3,600 hectares of rice increased by more than 15% compared to last year. Of the more than 13,000 cooperatives in Rehe Province, more than 11,200 cooperatives have grain yields this year that exceed both last year's yields and the yields of local mutual aid teams and individual farmers. According to a survey of 28,532 cooperatives in 40 counties and cities (suburban districts) in Liaoning Province, 76.2% increased production compared to local mutual aid teams, 18.3% had yields equivalent to local mutual aid teams, and only 5.5% decreased production due to natural disasters and poor management. Among the more than 13,000 cooperatives in 21 counties such as Huaide and Xi'an in Jilin Province, more than 9,970 cooperatives had a relatively large increase in production compared to local mutual aid teams. Most of the 16,000 hectares of newly cultivated paddy fields in the province belong to agricultural production cooperatives, with an average yield of about 8,000 catties per hectare for newly planted rice.

Due to the widespread increase in production in agricultural production cooperatives in various provinces, the income of cooperative members has also generally increased, with the income of poor peasant members and lower-middle peasant members greatly exceeding their income before joining the cooperative. Zhou Fulai, a poor peasant member of the Jinxing First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lishu County, Jilin Province, only harvested four shi (approximately 450 catties per shi) of grain annually from planting 1.2 hectares of land before joining the cooperative. This year, he received more than nine shi in the cooperative. Zhang Wenliang, a poor peasant member of the Tuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengde County, Rehe Province, can earn 8,600 catties of grain this year, a three-fold increase compared to before joining the cooperative. Yang Fenglin, a lower-middle peasant member, can receive 6,000 catties of grain this year, an increase of nearly two-fold compared to before joining the cooperative. After the distribution of profits in the Fifth Fourth Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburban area of Chengde City, the thirteen poor peasant member households that were grain-deficient in the past and the two lower-middle peasant member households that were neither deficient nor surplus have now become surplus grain households.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 19th Dispatch: Anhui Province is currently establishing more than 24,300 new agricultural production cooperatives. At the same time, more than 14,000 old cooperatives have absorbed a large number of new members. According to statistics from the Fuyang and Chuxian districts, more than 100,000 households have been absorbed as new members by more than 6,800 old cooperatives after the autumn harvest. In this round of establishing cooperatives, the old cooperatives played a leading role. Among the more than 1,100 new cooperatives established in Dangshan County, many were established with the help of the directors and committee members of the old cooperatives. Shou County transferred 262 key members from old cooperatives to help surrounding farmers establish 197 new cooperatives.

The peasants of Anhui Province, after a bumper harvest, are actively requesting to join old cooperatives or establish new cooperatives. In the Fuyang district, more than 27,000 mutual aid teams have requested to establish cooperatives. In the Liu'an district, more than 70% of the poor and lower-middle peasants are actively requesting to join cooperatives. According to the peasants' demand to take the road of cooperativization, the Communist Party of China's committees at all levels in Anhui Province have successively trained more than 90,000 district and township cadres, key members of cooperative establishment, and activists to help the peasants establish and expand agricultural production cooperatives.

At present, the work of establishing and expanding cooperatives in various parts of Anhui is still continuing. More than 14,400 mutual aid teams across the province have already set up the framework and are preparing to establish cooperatives. In order to develop agricultural production cooperatives on a large scale in a planned way after the autumn harvest, Anhui Province has conducted pilot projects of comprehensive cooperative planning in 170 townships. Recently, the Communist Party of China's Anhui Provincial Committee is summarizing the experience of planning work based on the characteristics of different regions in order to promote it comprehensively.

    东北绝大部分农业合作社增产
    安徽省进行合作化全面规划典型试验
    新华社十九日讯　辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、热河四省的九万多个农业生产合作社，绝大部分获得增产。黑龙江省今年春季以前建立的两万三千八百多个社，有百分之九十五左右获得增产。呼兰县的七百五十七个社中，有七百三十二个社比当地互助组增产一成到四成。桦川县已经合作化的第十区，三千六百公顷水稻比去年增产百分之十五以上。热河省一万三千多个社中，有一万一千二百多个社今年的粮食产量既超过去年，又高过当地互助组和单干农民的产量。据调查：辽宁省四十个县、市（郊区）的二万八千五百三十二个社中，比当地互助组增产的占百分之七十六点二，产量相当于当地互助组的占百分之十八点三，由于自然灾害和经营不善而减产的只有百分之五点五。吉林省怀德、西安等二十一个县的一万三千多个社中，比当地互助组增产较多的有九千九百七十多个社。全省新开垦的一万六千公顷水田，大部分是农业生产合作社的，新种水稻每公顷平均产量达八千斤左右。
    各省农业生产合作社由于普遍增产，社员收入也普遍增加，贫农社员和下中农社员的收入大大超过入社以前的收入。吉林省梨树县金星第一农业生产合作社的贫农社员周福来，入社前种一点二公顷地，年年只收四石（每石约四百五十斤）粮食。今年他在社内分了九石多。热河省承德县团结农业生产合作社贫农社员张文良，今年可收入八千六百斤粮食，比入社前增加三倍。下中农社员杨凤林今年可分六千斤粮食，比入社前增加近两倍。承德市郊区五四第二农业生产合作社分配收益后，过去是缺粮户的十三户贫农社员和两户不缺不余的下中农社员，现在都成了余粮户。
    新华社合肥十九日电　安徽省正在新建二万四千三百多个农业生产合作社。同时，有一万四千多个老社吸收了大批新社员。据阜阳、滁县两个专区统计，六千八百多个老社秋收后已吸收新社员十万多户。各地老社在这次办社中，发挥了带路的作用。砀山县新办的一千一百多个社中，就有很多社是由老社的社长、社务委员等帮助办起来的。寿县抽调了二百六十二个老社的骨干，帮助周围农民办了一百九十七个新社。
    丰收后的安徽省农民积极要求加入老社或建立新社。阜阳专区有二万七千多个互助组要求办社。六安专区有百分之七十以上的贫农和下中农积极要求入社。中共安徽省各级党委根据农民走合作化道路的要求，先后训练了九万多名区乡干部、办社骨干和积极分子，帮助农民建立和扩大农业生产合作社。
    目前安徽各地办社、扩社工作仍在继续进行。全省已有一万四千四百多个互助组搭好了架子，准备办社。为了在秋后有计划地大规模发展农业生产合作社，安徽省已在一百七十个乡进行了合作化全面规划的典型试验。最近中共安徽省委员会正在根据不同地区的特点，总结规划工作的经验，以便全面推广。
