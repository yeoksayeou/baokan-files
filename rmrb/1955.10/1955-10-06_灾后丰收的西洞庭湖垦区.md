To the Editor:

Recently, I visited the Minzhu Yangcheng Reclamation Area in the West Dongting Lake region of Hunan and witnessed a scene of post-disaster harvest.

This reclamation area is located in the Dongting Lake area, known as one of the "granaries" of the motherland. However, in the past, this was a disaster-prone area. Due to the interference and backwater effect of the Yuan and Li rivers, successive reactionary rulers only cared about exploitation and did not repair the dikes and embankments, so the enclosure dikes often collapsed, causing disasters. The Wufu enclosure dike alone collapsed for five consecutive years from 1945 to 1949. At that time, these words were popular among the local people: "No matter if the North Water (referring to the Li River) or the South Water (referring to the Yuan River) rises, we have to move; if both rivers rise at the same time, we can only run and abandon our homes."

After liberation, under the leadership and support of the Party and the government, local farmers repaired the dikes and embankments. In 1954, due to an extraordinary flood unseen in a century, the dikes and embankments collapsed. However, the Party and the government quickly led the affected farmers to safely relocate to mountainous areas to produce and help themselves, and promptly provided relief and loans to ensure the lives of the farmers in the disaster area. Soon after, the Party and the government mobilized more than 800,000 laborers to repair Dongting Lake, with nearly 200,000 laborers from the Minzhu Yangcheng Reclamation Area alone. After more than four months of repair work last winter and this spring, two modern sluice gates were built to regulate the floodwaters, and five river mouths were blocked. The Yuan and Li rivers each had independent flood channels and no longer interfered with each other. Therefore, although the Yuan and Li rivers rose successively in May and June this year, the farmers living on both sides of the rivers were able to produce with peace of mind, no longer packing their luggage and preparing to flee with carrying poles at the first sign of flooding, as they did in the past. In addition, due to the shortening of the dike line in the reclamation area, the barren isles and lakes near Wuling and Tiejiatui have been turned into fertile land free from floods and droughts.

During this year's autumn harvest season, the Minzhu Yangcheng Reclamation Area is full of the atmosphere of harvest. The average yield of more than 50,000 mu of early rice in the whole area this year is more than 100 jin per mu higher than in 1953. The mid-season rice harvest is even better than the early rice, and the late rice is currently growing very well. The 22 agricultural production cooperatives in the area alone increased the production of grain by more than 1 million jin for the state this year. The Jiqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Haozigang District, Changde County, harvested an average of more than 640 jin per mu on its 270 mu of early and mid-season rice fields, an increase of 76 percent over 1953. The mutual aid team where poor peasant Zeng Dongfu (deputy head of Ren'an Township) is located had an average yield of more than 500 jin per mu on its 160 mu of paddy fields this year; his family's more than 11 mu of paddy fields can harvest at least 6,000 jin of grain. After deducting agricultural taxes and rations for five people, he plans to sell more than 2,000 jin of grain to the state.

People have not only won this year's harvest through labor, but also began to utilize the newly expanded large areas of cultivated land after merging the enclosures and rivers. The plains east of Chongtian Lake have been barren for many years, with reeds growing taller than people. As the lake control work neared its end, a huge change took place on the barren plains. The state-owned West Dongting Farm was established here. More than 1,200 employees of the farm have paid hard work here. When they first arrived at the site, the working conditions were very poor: there were no houses, so they temporarily built some shacks; there were no stoves, so they dug a hole in the ground and set up a pot to cook food. In this way, they opened 35,000 mu of wasteland and sowed seeds in a short period of time; this year alone, they will produce more than 11 million jin of grain, 1 million jin of sorghum, and 40,000 jin of cotton for the state.

Now the farm staff are marching towards the wasteland, with four tractors pulling five-furrow plows towards the depths of the endless grassland, the loose black soil spreading farther and farther....

This winter and next spring, the West Dongting Farm also plans to install two 400-horsepower engines and four water pumps by the side of Baitao Lake. By 1959, the total cultivated area of the farm will reach 90,000 mu. At that time, there will be crops everywhere, lotus and water chestnuts all over the lake, and endless fresh fish in winter; 30 tractors will be cultivating in the fields, and transport vehicles will be running all over the farm.... The vast number of farmers in the lakeside area will see their beautiful prospects from here.

### 灾后丰收的西洞庭湖垦区

    灾后丰收的西洞庭湖垦区编辑同志：
    最近我访问了湖南西洞庭湖区民主阳城垦殖区，看到了一片灾后丰收的情景。
    这个垦殖区在号称祖国“粮仓”之一的洞庭湖滨湖地区。但是，过去这里却是一个多灾多难的地方。由于沅、澧二水的干扰顶托，历来的反动统治者又是只顾搜刮不修堤垸，因此垸子经常溃决成灾。单是五福垸，从一九四五年到一九四九年就连续溃了五年。那时，在当地群众中流行着这样几句话：“不管北水（指澧水）、南水（指沅水）发，我们都得要搬家；要是两水同时发，只有跑人不顾家。”
    解放后，当地农民在党和政府的领导和支持下整修堤垸。一九五四年由于遭到百年来未有的特大洪水，以致堤垸溃决，但是党和政府迅速领导受灾农民安全转移到山区借田生产自救，并及时进行救济和发放贷款，保障了灾区农民的生活。不久，党和政府又动员八十多万劳动大军整修洞庭湖，光是民主阳城垦殖区的民工就近二十万人。经过去冬、今春四个多月的整修工作，由于建立了两座现代化的水闸来调节洪水，堵死了五个河口，沅、澧两水各自有了独立的洪道，不再互相干扰顶托了。因此，今年五、六月份，虽然沅、澧两水先后上涨，住在两水两岸的农民都能安心生产，再也不像过去那样一到汛期就捆起行李，扁担不离手地准备逃荒了。此外，由于缩短了垦殖区的堤线，使五毛岭、铁家咀一带的荒洲湖汊都变成了水旱无忧的良田。
    在今年的秋收季节，民主阳城垦殖区充满了丰收的气息。今年全区五万多亩早稻的平均产量比起一九五三年来每亩要增加一百多斤，中稻年成还胜过早稻，晚稻目前也长得很好。光是全区的二十二个农业生产合作社，今年就为国家增产了一百多万斤谷子。常德县蒿子港区积庆农业生产合作社的二百七十多亩早、中稻田平均每亩收六百四十多斤，比一九五三年增产百分之七十六。贫农曾东甫（仁安乡副乡长）所在的互助组，今年一百六十多亩水田平均产量是五百多斤；他家的十一亩多水田至少可以收六千多斤谷，除去农业税和五个人的口粮外，他计划卖给国家两千多斤谷子。
    人们不仅用劳动赢得了今年的丰收，而且开始利用并垸并流后新扩大的大片耕地。冲天湖以东的平原多少年来一直荒芜着，芦苇长得比人高。当治湖快要结束的时候，荒芜的平原上发生了巨大的变化，国营西洞庭农场在这里建立起来了。农场的一千二百多名职工在这里付出了辛勤的劳动。初来场地时，工作条件是很差的：没有房子，他们临时搭了些草棚；没有灶，他们在地下挖个洞架起锅就煮饭弄菜。就这样，他们在短短的时期内开了三万五千亩荒，播下了种；今年一年将要替国家生产一千一百多万斤粮食，一百万斤高粱和四万斤皮棉。
    现在农场的工作人员们正在向荒地进军，四台拖拉机牵引着五铧犁走向望不到头的草原深处，松软的黑土越展越远……。
    今冬、明春，西洞庭农场还准备在白涛湖边安装两台四百马力的发动机、四台抽水机。到一九五九年，全场耕地面积将要达到九万亩。那时，遍地庄稼，满湖莲、菱，冬天还有打不尽的鲜鱼；三十台拖拉机在原野上耕作着，运输汽车奔驰全场……。湖滨地区广大农民将从这里看到他们的美好远景。
