    Construction of Hengyang Xiangjiang River Bridge Begins
    Construction of the Hengyang Xiangjiang River Bridge has officially commenced. This bridge is over 400 meters long and is a dual-purpose bridge for both railway and highway traffic. The upper level is a highway bridge for large vehicles and pedestrians, while the lower level is a railway bridge for trains. Both ends of the bridge have approach bridges, and the bridge body is quite high, allowing ships to pass underneath even during the flood season.

    The surveying, exploration, and preliminary design of this bridge were carried out by Chinese bridge engineers and technicians with the assistance and guidance of Soviet experts. The construction of the bridge will employ mechanized and semi-mechanized construction methods. This will not only reduce the physical labor of workers but also greatly accelerate the progress of the project. The construction of all piers and abutments will be completed before the arrival of spring floods next year.

    This bridge is expected to be completed and open to traffic in the third quarter of 1956. It will directly connect the Yuehan and Xianggui railway lines. Trains on the Yuehan Railway transferring to the Xianggui Railway will no longer have to detour around the temporary bridge but can pass directly over this bridge, making connections between Northeast, North China, and East China with the Southwest and South China seaports more convenient. This bridge will also connect the Jiangdong and Jiangxi districts of Hengyang City into a unified whole, making Hengyang City even more prosperous. (Reported by our correspondent in Changsha)

    衡阳湘江大桥动工修建
    衡阳湘江大桥已正式动工修建。这座大桥全长四百多公尺，是一座铁路和公路的两用桥，上层是通行大型汽车的公路桥和人行道，下层是通行火车的铁桥。这座桥的两端有引桥，桥身相当高，就在洪水季节，船舶也可以从桥下通过。
    这座大桥的测量、钻探和初步设计，都是由我国桥梁工程师和技术人员在苏联专家的帮助和指导下进行的。大桥的建设将采用机械化和半机械化的施工方法。这不仅可以减轻工人的体力劳动，而且可以大大加速工程进度。全部桥墩、桥台的施工任务将在明年春水到来之前完成。
    这座大桥预计在一九五六年第三季度竣工通车。它将使粤汉、湘桂两铁路干线直接贯通起来，粤汉路转湘桂路的火车，将不再绕便桥行驶，而可直接从这座大桥上通过，这就使我国东北、华北和华东等地同西南和南海海港之间的联系更为方便。这座大桥还能把衡阳市江东、江西两区连成一体，使衡阳市更趋繁荣。（本报驻长沙记者）
