Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th TASS dispatch: Moscow newspapers published the Soviet-Canadian communiqué on the 12th. The full text is as follows:

    From October 5th to 12th, the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Pearson, visited the Soviet Union as a guest of the Soviet government.
    During his stay in Moscow, Mr. Pearson met with leaders of the Soviet government and held talks with the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Molotov, the Minister of Foreign Trade, Mr. Kabanov, and the Acting Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union, Mr. Kaftanov.
    The Canadian side participating in these talks included those accompanying Mr. Pearson: Deputy Minister of Trade Mr. Shappi, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Holmes, and the Canadian Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Soviet Union, Mr. Watkins.
    The Soviet side participating in the talks included the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Mr. Zorin, the Soviet Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Canada, Mr. Chuvakhin, and the Director of the Second European Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Yerofeyev.
    These meetings and talks were conducted in a sincere atmosphere, and many issues were discussed, including specific issues related to both countries and other issues of great international significance. The exchange of views has enabled both sides to better understand each other's viewpoints, which will help the development of good relations between the two countries.
    Both sides believe that as long as there is goodwill and a sincere desire to consolidate peace and friendly relations between countries, there is no problem between countries or groups of countries that cannot be resolved peacefully. Mr. Molotov and Mr. Pearson expressed satisfaction with the fact that the views of the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, in which the Soviet Union and Canada participate, have converged, and they have established a common understanding of the need to promote a prompt solution to the disarmament issue. Both sides agreed that, in order to achieve this goal, it is particularly important to develop trust between countries and strengthen security. Measures to further ease international tension must serve this purpose. Both sides noted with satisfaction that the decisions of the Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Powers in July this year had contributed to the easing of international tension, although many issues remained to be resolved.
    Since Mr. Molotov was one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, and Canada is a participant in the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Indochina, it was possible for both sides to discuss the Indochina issue. Both sides reaffirmed that efforts should be made to implement the Geneva Accords while maintaining the ceasefire and not allowing military action, despite the difficulties in this regard.
    Taking advantage of Mr. Pearson's visit, the possibility of concluding a trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Canada, adhering to the most-favored-nation principle and on a mutually beneficial basis, was also studied. Both ministers believe that it is important to take measures to eliminate various barriers to international trade. The two sides reached a sufficient degree of agreement on the following principle: that negotiations, which began in Moscow, should continue in Ottawa in the near future, and it is hoped that the negotiations will produce good results that are beneficial to both countries.
    During the talks, both sides agreed that mutual visits, both official and non-official, can to some extent eliminate suspicion and misunderstanding. Both sides agreed that efforts must be made to eliminate obstacles to a freer exchange of information and views, and that cooperation between the two countries in culture, science and technology must be expanded as much as possible. In this regard, both sides agreed that measures for cooperation in industry, transportation, and agriculture, and measures for cooperation in the exchange of information on scientific research in the Arctic region must first be studied.
    Both sides also agreed that mutual visits by parliamentary delegations would contribute to a better mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and Canada and help strengthen ties between the two countries.
    The foreign ministers of both countries acknowledged that differences in the views of their governments on some political and economic issues should not prevent them from cooperating on many specific issues based on their mutual interests and the desire to promote peace and good-neighborly relations. All kinds of cooperation will be based on the principle of non-interference by one country in the internal affairs of another, and will be inspired by the desire of both countries to work together to establish world peace and ensure security.

    苏联—加拿大公报
    新华社十二日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十二日电：莫斯科各报十二日刊载了苏联—加拿大公报。全文如下：
    十月五日到十二日，加拿大外交部长皮尔逊作为苏联政府的贵宾访问了苏联。
    在莫斯科期间，皮尔逊曾经同苏联政府的领导人员会见，同苏联外交部长莫洛托夫、对外贸易部长卡巴诺夫和苏联文化部代理部长卡夫坦诺夫举行了会谈。
    加拿大方面参加这些次会谈的有陪同皮尔逊的人员：贸易部副部长夏皮、外交部副部长霍姆斯和加拿大驻苏联特命全权大使华金斯。
    苏联方面参加会谈的有苏联外交部副部长佐林、苏联驻加拿大特命全权大使楚瓦欣和苏联外交部第二欧洲司司长叶罗费耶夫。
    这些会见和谈话是在诚挚的气氛中进行的，并且谈到了许多问题，其中包括和两国有关的专门问题以及具有重大国际意义的其他问题。交换意见使得双方更加明了彼此的观点，这将有助于两国良好关系的发展。
    双方认为，只要有巩固和平和国与国之间的友好关系的善意和真诚的愿望，那么，在国与国或者国家集团之间就没有什么问题不能用和平的方式解决。莫洛托夫和皮尔逊对下列事实表示满意：苏联和加拿大参加的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的观点已趋于接近，并且在促成裁军问题的迅速解决的必要性方面确定了共同的看法。双方同意，为了达成这一目的，发展国与国之间的信任和加强安全感是特别重要的。进一步缓和国际紧张局势的措施必须服从于这一目的。双方满意地指出，今年七月间四国政府首脑日内瓦会议的决定促成了国际紧张局势的缓和，虽然仍旧有许多问题有待解决。
    由于莫洛托夫是日内瓦会议的主席之一，而加拿大是印度支那国际监督和监察委员会的参加者，因此，双方就有可能讨论印度支那问题。双方确认，应当在维持停战和不容许军事行动的情况下力求实现日内瓦协定，尽管在这方面存在着困难。
    趁皮尔逊的访问之便还研究了苏联和加拿大两国之间在遵守最优惠的原则下并在互利的基础上缔结贸易协定的可能性。两国部长都认为，采取消除国际贸易方面的各种障碍的措施是重要的。双方对下列原则达成了足够程度的协议：即在最近时期内在渥太华继续举行在莫斯科开始的谈判，并且希望谈判产生对两国有利的良好结果。
    在会谈过程中双方同意：通过扩大官方的和非官方的互相访问，可以在一定程度上消除怀疑和不了解。双方一致同意：必须努力消除妨碍更自由地交换情报和观点的障碍，必须尽可能地扩大两国在文化、科学和技术上的合作。在这方面双方约定，必须首先研究在工业、运输业、农业方面合作的措施和在交换北极地区的科学研究工作的情报方面的合作的措施。
    双方还一致同意，议会代表团的互相访问有助于苏联同加拿大之间更好的互相谅解，有助于加强两国之间的联系。
    两国的外交部长承认，他们的政府在一些政治和经济问题上的看法的分歧不应该妨碍它们根据彼此的利益和促进和平及睦邻关系的愿望而在许多具体问题上进行合作。各种合作将以一国不干涉另一国内政的原则为基础，将受到两国为确立世界和平和保障安全而共同努力的愿望的鼓舞。
