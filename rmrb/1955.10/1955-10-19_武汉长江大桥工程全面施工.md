The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project has entered full-scale construction. Li Fen, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the most difficult and complex foundation work of the entire Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project now has three bridge piers under construction on the river at the same time; and two to three more bridge piers will also begin construction successively by the end of this year. Since construction began on the left bank approach bridge in July, the pipe piles for five of the seventeen bridge abutments have been driven, and a forest of piles now stands on the left bank of the Yangtze River. The approach bridge on the right bank of the bridge has begun test piling and will soon begin formal construction. At the junction of the Beijing-Hankou and Yuehan Railways on both sides of Hanyang and Wuchang, road builders are building roadbeds towards the ends of the Yangtze River Bridge; the Yuehugang overpass on the Hanyang connection line has already begun pouring concrete for the piers.

Li Fen said that the fourth quarter of this year and the first and second quarters of next year will be a tense and crucial construction season for the foundation engineering of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that the railway section of the Yangtze River Bridge will be open to traffic in 1958, and the highway section will be open to traffic in 1959. In order to ensure the completion of this year's annual plan and the completion of the Yangtze River Bridge on schedule, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau has adopted a variety of organizational and technical measures, and has organized a labor competition between various teams, sections, and stations of the entire bureau since October.

Li Fen said that the water level of the Yangtze River is continuing to fall, which is beneficial to the construction of the bridge, but the strong and frequent winter north wind of the Yangtze River will increase the difficulty of winter construction. In the next two months, we will also need to solve new technical problems such as pouring underwater concrete in the pipe piles and inserting steel sheet pile cofferdams in deep water.

    武汉长江大桥工程全面施工
    武汉长江大桥工程已经全面施工。武汉长江大桥工程局副总工程师李芬对新华社记者说，武汉长江大桥整个工程中最艰巨复杂的基础工程，现在已有三个桥墩同时在江面上施工；还有两个到三个桥墩也将在今年年底陆续开始施工。大桥左岸引桥工程从七月施工以来，十七个桥台中已打完了五个桥台的管桩，树林般的桩群现在已在长江左岸立起。大桥右岸的引桥已开始试桩，不久就要正式施工。汉阳和武昌两岸京汉铁路和粤汉铁路的联络线工地上，筑路人员正向长江大桥两端修筑路基；汉阳联络线上的月湖港跨线桥已经在浇灌墩台混凝土。
    李芬说，今年第四季和明年一、二季，是武汉长江大桥基础工程紧张而有关键意义的施工季节。五年计划规定，长江大桥的铁路部分在一九五八年通车；公路部分在一九五九年通车。为了保证完成今年年度计划和长江大桥按期完工，武汉长江大桥工程局已采取了多种组织措施和技术措施，并从十月份起组织了全局各队、段、站之间展开劳动竞赛。
    李芬说，现在武汉长江水位正在继续下落，这对大桥施工是有利的，但是强劲而经常的长江冬季北风，又将增加冬季施工的困难。未来的两个月里，我们还要解决在管柱内浇灌水下混凝土、在深水中插筑钢板桩围堰等等新的技术问题。
