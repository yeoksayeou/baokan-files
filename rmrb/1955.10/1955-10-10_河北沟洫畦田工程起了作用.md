    Hebei's Ditch-Furrow Raised Field Project Has Taken Effect
    Hebei Province focused on a trial implementation of more than 350,000 mu of ditch-furrow raised field projects this year. After the test of the rainy season, these projects have all played a role in preventing waterlogging and drought. In the area where Mancheng County constructed ditch-furrow raised fields, there was once a rainfall of more than 110 millimeters in four hours (in the past, such rain would cause water accumulation of two chi deep), but there was no water accumulation on the ground, and the crops grew very vigorously. This spring, Hejian County constructed more than 80,000 mu of hardened-soil raised fields, and rainwater was controlled, so the Wudi areas of Linjiawu, Xiejiawu, and Jiaochangwu, which were prone to waterlogging when it rained, did not accumulate water, saving more than 8,000 mu of Wudi from flooding. The increase in production from ditch-furrow terraced fields in Fengrun County and other places is even more obvious, with each mu of terraced field producing 200 jin of seed cotton, an increase of ten times compared to the yield of non-terraced fields.
    Due to the influence of geographical and climatic conditions, Hebei Province experiences heavy rainfall concentrated in July and August, resulting in spring drought and autumn floods, causing serious losses to agricultural production. This year, farmers in various places have seen the good effects of the ditch-furrow raised field projects, and many agricultural production cooperatives have included the construction of ditch-furrow raised field projects as part of their production increase plans.

    河北沟洫畦田工程起了作用
    河北省今年重点试办了三十五万多亩沟洫畦田工程。经过雨季考验，这些工程都起到了防涝防旱作用。满城县修做沟洫畦田的地区，有一次四小时降雨一百一十多公厘（往年下这样雨就要积水二尺深），地面没有积水，而庄稼生长得很茁壮。河间县今春做土硬畦田八万多亩，雨水都被控制起来，因而林家污、解家污、教场污这些有雨就涝的污地，都没有积水，使八千多亩污地免除了水灾。丰润县等地的沟洫台田增产更为明显，每亩台田可产籽棉二百斤，比不是台田地的产量增加十倍。
    河北省因受地理和气候等条件的影响，暴雨多集中在七、八月间，因而春旱秋涝，使农业生产遭受到严重损失。今年各地农民看到沟洫畦田工程的效益很好，许多农业生产合作社把修沟洫畦田工程作为增产计划的内容之一。　　　　　（张鹏）
