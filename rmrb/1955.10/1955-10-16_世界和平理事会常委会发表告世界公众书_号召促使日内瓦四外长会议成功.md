Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, October 15th: According to TASS, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, at its meeting on the 13th, adopted an appeal to the world public in view of the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Geneva.

The appeal to the world public stated: The Geneva Four-Power Heads of State Conference brought about a profound change in the international atmosphere. This conference reflected the aspirations of the people of all countries. The public will never agree to let the initial achievements made be reduced to nothing, nor will the public be satisfied with merely a respite in the "Cold War."

The appeal to the world public pointed out that the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference needs to overcome some serious difficulties, and only through sincere and patient consultation can a solution be found. Even a small agreement can lead to further development. An agreement on security can accelerate disarmament, and an agreement on disarmament can help solve security issues and restore German unification.

The appeal to the world public stated: The views of all parties on disarmament are already so close that disarmament can be achieved now as long as the governments are sincere. As for expanding contact and international exchanges, the first step has already been taken. The public will not allow this situation: if consensus cannot be reached on a certain item on the agenda in Geneva, this should not be used as an excuse to cancel these achievements or cause the conference to fail.

The appeal to the world public pointed out: The people of all countries will not allow the "Cold War" to return. They demand new steps in international cooperation. They demand the abandonment of the policy of military blocs and the replacement of the policy of coercion and cold war with a policy of consultation in all places where it is practiced.

The appeal to the world public finally called on everyone and the people of every country to take action so that the spirit of Geneva can triumph in every country and on every continent.

    世界和平理事会常委会发表告世界公众书
    号召促使日内瓦四外长会议成功
    新华社十五日讯　据塔斯社维也纳十四日讯：鉴于四国外长会议即将在日内瓦举行，世界和平理事会常务委员会在十三日的会议上通过了告全世界公众书。
    告全世界公众书说：日内瓦四国政府首脑会议使国际气氛起了深刻的变化。这次会议反映了各国 人民的愿望。公众永远不会同意让已取得的初步成就化为乌有，公众也不会以仅仅是在“冷战”中的一次喘息为满足。
    告全世界公众书指出，即将举行的四国外长会议需要克服一些严重的困难，只有诚意地和耐心地进行协商，才能求得问题的解决。只要达成那怕是微小的协议，就可以求得进一步的发展。达成关于安全的协议就可以加速裁军，而达成关于裁军的协议就可以有助于解决安全问题和恢复德国统一问题。
    告全世界公众书说：各方在裁军问题上的观点已经是这样地接近，只要各国政府有诚意现在就可以实现裁军。至于扩大接触和国际往来，第一步已经走了。公众不容许这种做法：在日内瓦对议程上的某一项不能得到一致同意，就要以此作为借口来取消这些成果或者使会议失败。
    告全世界公众书指出：各国人民不容许“冷战”重来。他们要求采取国际合作的新的步骤。他们要求放弃军事集团政策，在一切实行强力和冷战政策的地方都改用协商的政策。
    告全世界公众书最后号召每个人和每个国家的人民都行动起来，以便使日内瓦精神在各个国家和各大洲都得到胜利。
