    (Our report) State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are actively strengthening peak season supply work.

    The quantity and variety of peak season goods prepared by state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives this year have increased compared to last year.

The amount of major autumn and winter commodities such as cotton-padded leather shoes, leather hats, cotton-padded clothing, and woolen underwear prepared by the state-owned commercial departments in Liaoning Province has increased by approximately 20% to 60% compared to actual sales last year; small sundry goods such as hairnets, hammer handles, thimbles, buttons, clasps, and tobacco pipe holders, which were difficult to buy in rural markets last year, will also be vigorously supplied this year. The supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are preparing to supply more than 350,000 new-style farm implements, including double-wheeled double-share plows, double-wheeled single-share plows, disc harrows, and seeders in the autumn, which is equivalent to about twice the total national supply last year.

Department stores in Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, Gansu and other provinces have also established sales offices led by managers or deputy managers, responsible for regularly mastering and analyzing market changes and business operations, strengthening supervision and inspection of grass-roots stores, and promptly solving problems hindering the development of sales work.

    加强旺季物资供应工作
    本报讯各地国营商业部门和供销合作社，正积极加强旺季物资供应工作。
    今年国营商业部门和供销合作社准备的旺季物资，数量和品种都比去年增加。全国国营商业部门下半年准备供应绒衣、绒裤、胶鞋、毛巾、袜子等商品的数量，比去年同期增加百分之十六到三十九点四。辽宁省国营商业部门准备供应的棉皮鞋、皮帽、棉衣、绒衣等秋冬季大宗商品，比去年实际销售量增加百分之二十到六十左右；去年农村市场不易买到的发网、锤把、顶针、扣子、卡子、烟袋杆等零星小百货，今年也将大力供应。各地供销合作社准备在秋季供应的双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁、圆盘耙、播种机等主要新式农具，共有三十五万多部，相当于去年全国全年供应量的两倍左右。河北省供销合作社从今年九月到明年二月供应农民的各种生产资料，将比去年同期实际供应量增加百分之二十一以上。
    为了更好地满足城乡人民的需要，中国百货公司最近还根据生产发展的情况，降低了铁壳水瓶、自行车、缝纫机、收音机等商品的价格。铁壳水瓶降低价格百分之十五左右，缝纫机一般降低百分之十二到二十，收音机主要品种平均降低百分之十四左右。
    各地国营商业部门和供销合作社都加强了批发业务，健全了批发网。浙江省的批发机构比去年初增加了百分之三十九，广东省粤西地区的批发门市部比去年增加了一倍多。广东、广西、山东、安徽、河南、湖南、湖北、四川、浙江、黑龙江、甘肃等省的百货公司还成立了由经理或副经理领导的推销办公室，负责经常掌握和分析市场变化和业务经营情况，加强对基层商店的督促和检查，及时解决阻碍推销工作开展的问题。
    目前，各地国营商店和供销合作社正在通过召开物资交流会、送货下乡、赶集摆摊等方式，大力展开旺季物资供应工作。
