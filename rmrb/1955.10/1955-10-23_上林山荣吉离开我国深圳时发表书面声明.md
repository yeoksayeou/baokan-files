Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: Shoji Kamiyama, head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation to China, issued a written statement upon leaving Shenzhen, China.

    We, the Japanese Diet Members Delegation to China, were invited to participate in China's National Day celebrations. We also had the opportunity to visit various parts of China. We were warmly received by the Chinese people and responsible authorities everywhere we went.

    We have seen China forging ahead with economic construction as its focus, and we believe this will play a significant role in world peace and the peace of the Far East. At the same time, we have seen the rapid development of China in education, social welfare facilities, and worker housing construction, and we sincerely hope that China will work harder to complete its Five-Year Plan.

    For the sake of friendship, trade expansion, normalization of diplomatic relations, and peace between Japan and China, we held long talks with Chairman Mao, Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, and others. These talks took place in a friendly atmosphere, and based on the agreements reached, Vice-Chairman and Secretary-General Peng Zhen and I issued a joint communique in Beijing on the 17th of this month.

    We believe that relevant personnel from both Japan and China should actively work towards the implementation of this joint communique in the future.

    As we bid farewell to China, we express our deep gratitude for the friendship of the Chinese side and wish the new China a prosperous future.
        Shoji Kamiyama, Head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation to China

    新华社二十二日讯　日本国会议员访华团团长上林山荣吉在离开中国深圳时的书面声明
    我们日本国会议员访华团应邀参加了中国国庆典礼。我们并得到了在中国各地访问的机会。我们到处都受到中国人民与负责当局的热情的款待。
    我们看到中国在以经济建设为重点而勇往直前的迈进着，我们认为这对世界与远东的和平会起到极大的作用。同时，我们也看到中国在教育、社会福利设施、工人住宅建设方面的飞跃发展，而由衷地希望中国为了五年计划的完成而更加努力奋斗。
    我们为了日中两国间的友好、贸易的扩大、邦交的正常化与和平而和毛主席、刘委员长、周总理等进行了长时间的会谈，这一会谈是在友好的空气中进行的，并且在会谈达成协议的基础上，由彭真副委员长兼秘书长和我于本月十七日在北京发表了联合公报。
    我们认为今后日中两国的有关人员应当为这一联合公报的实现而积极努力。
    当向中国告别的时候，我们对于中国方面的友谊表示深厚的谢意，并祝新中国的日益发展。
        日本国会议员访华团团长　上林山荣吉
