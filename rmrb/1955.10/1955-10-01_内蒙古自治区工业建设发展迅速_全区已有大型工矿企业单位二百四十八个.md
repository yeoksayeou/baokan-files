By August of this year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had successively built 58 new factories and mines. Adding those built before the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan starting in 1953, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region currently has 248 large-scale industrial and mining enterprises. There are hundreds of small and medium-sized enterprises, such as milk processing factories, scattered across the Inner Mongolian grasslands. Baotou, formerly a consumer city, has now built factories serving the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base, including power, machinery, brick and tile, and refractory material factories. In Xilinhot, on the Xilin Gol grasslands, which previously had only an ancient temple and dozens of adobe houses, a wool mill has been put into production this year, following the establishment of a power station last year. This year, in addition to the Baotou Sugar Factory, which will be put into production in October, dozens of newly built factories such as the Ulanhot Power Plant are also under intense construction.

Thanks to the strong support from the central government and all parts of the country, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region now has modern factories. Currently, more than one-third of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's 240-plus large-scale industrial and mining enterprises possess new-style machinery and equipment. Inner Mongolia's forestry industry, with direct investment from the state, has built 390 kilometers of railways in virgin forest areas and added hauling tractors, river-crossing machines, cranes, and power saws. This year, new industrial sectors such as tractor repair plants, lumber mills, and power stations are also being established.

The production capacity of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's industry has increased significantly over the past two years. The total industrial output value in 1952 increased sevenfold compared to 1950, and in 1954 it increased by 1.37 times compared to 1952, reaching 62.9 percent of the planned target for 1957. In the first eight months of this year, the output value of the region's 109 major factories and mines increased by 27.33 percent compared to the same period in 1954.

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's industry has also made great achievements in serving farmers and herdsmen and supporting national industrial construction. In 1953 and 1954, the forestry industry supplied more than 2 million cubic meters of high-quality timber for national industrial construction and transportation construction. Over the past two years, Inner Mongolia's local industries have successfully trial-produced more than 20 new products. Currently, Inner Mongolia's farm implement factories are able to produce new-style farm tools such as double-wheeled double-furrow plows, three-toothed light weeding hoes, shovel plows, and eight-inch walking plows. The Hailar Machinery and Iron Factory has also manufactured new products for herdsmen, such as soybean cake slicers, turnip crushers, and blades for hay cutters.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will also carry out industrial construction on an even larger scale. The state will build China's new iron and steel industrial base—the Baotou Iron and Steel United Enterprise—and other important factories and mines in Inner Mongolia. To fully utilize the autonomous region's livestock products, the state will also invest in building two modern meat joint processing plants and bone meal plants. In addition, 20 projects above the quota and 150 projects below the quota will be newly built and renovated. By 1957, the proportion of industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will increase from 19 percent in 1952 to 36.82 percent. The implementation of the First Five-Year Plan will lay a preliminary foundation for changing the backward economic and cultural conditions of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

    内蒙古自治区工业建设发展迅速
    全区已有大型工矿企业单位二百四十八个
    到今年八月份，内蒙古自治区已相继兴建起五十八座新的工厂和矿山。加上一九五三年开始执行第一个五年计划以前建设起来的在内，目前，内蒙古自治区已有大型的工矿企业单位二百四十八个。中、小型的企业，仅牛奶加工一类的工厂，就有几百个散布在内蒙古草原上。原来的消费城市包头市现在已建设起为包头钢铁工业基地建设服务的电力、机器、砖瓦和耐火器材等工厂。在锡林郭勒草原上的锡林浩特，过去只有一座古庙和几十间土房，继去年建立了发电站后，今年又有毛织厂投入了生产。今年，除了包头糖厂将在十月份投入生产外，乌兰浩特发电厂等几十个新建工厂也正在紧张施工。
    由于中央和全国各地大力帮助，内蒙古自治区已经有了现代化的工厂。现在，内蒙古自治区的二百四十多座大型工矿企业，三分之一以上都拥有新式的机器设备。内蒙古森林工业，经国家的直接投资，已在原始森林地带修筑了三百九十多公里的铁路，增添了搬运拖拉机、出河机、吊车和动力锯。今年又在建立拖拉机修理厂、制材厂和发电站等新的工业部门。
    内蒙古自治区工业的生产能力，两年多以来有显著的增长。一九五二年工业总产值比一九五零年提高了七倍，一九五四年又比一九五二年增加了一点三七倍，达到了一九五七年计划指标的百分之六十二点九。今年前八个月，全区的一百零九个主要厂矿的产值又比一九五四年同时期增长了百分之二十七点三三。
    内蒙古自治区工业在为农牧民服务和支援国家工业建设方面也有很大成就。森林工业在一九五三年和一九五四年，供应了国家工业建设和交通运输业建设的优良木材二百多万立方公尺。两年来，内蒙古的地方工业已试制成功二十多种新产品。现在，内蒙古的农具厂已能够生产双轮双铧犁、三齿轻便耘锄、铲?机和八寸步犁等新式农具。海拉尔机械铁工厂还为牧民制造了豆饼切片机、萝?粉碎机和打草机的刀片等新产品。
    在第一个五年计划期间，内蒙古自治区还将进行规模更加巨大的工业建设。国家将在内蒙古建设我国新的钢铁工业基地——包头钢铁联合企业和其他重要厂矿。为了充分利用自治区的畜牧业产品，国家还将投资兴建两座现代化的肉类联合加工厂和骨粉厂。另外，还将新建和改建二十个限额以上的工程和一百五十个限额以下工程。到一九五七年，内蒙古自治区的工业产值在工农业总产值中所占的比重，将由一九五二年的百分之十九，上升为百分之三十六点八二。第一个五年计划实现后，将为改变内蒙古自治区的经济、文化落后面貌奠定初步的基础。　                                 （新华社）
