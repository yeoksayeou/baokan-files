    Earnestly Learn From Lu Xun
    -- Commemorating the Nineteenth Anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's Death
    Chen Yong

    I

    Twenty-five years ago, when the Chinese Left-Wing Writers League was just established, and the revolutionary literary ranks led by the Chinese proletariat were just beginning to take shape organizationally, Lu Xun presented the urgent task of using proletarian thought to criticize and transform bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thought to Chinese revolutionary literary workers. Lu Xun published his famous speech "Opinions on the Left-Wing Writers League," which has very important significance in modern Chinese literature.

    The important significance of Lu Xun's speech has not passed to this day, because what Lu Xun proposed here is the fundamental, long-term, and extensive task of the Chinese literary struggle.

    In this speech, Lu Xun particularly emphasized the combination of writers and revolutionary practice, emphasized that writers should recognize the long-term and arduous nature of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, emphasized that writers should have a clear and firm understanding of the revolution, emphasized the idea of carrying the revolution through to the end, and opposed wavering and compromise, and opposed giving up halfway. Lu Xun's thought still has profound educational significance for us today.

    Lu Xun's own life shows that he had an increasingly profound understanding of the revolution, and that he was a great example in this regard. Everyone knows that people of Lu Xun's era constantly experienced drastic divisions. Many people who had originally stood on the side of progress gave in to the tests of reality and went over to the side of reaction, or became passive. This is what Lu Xun called "some rose to high positions, some retired..." But Lu Xun always adhered to the revolutionary position. The test Lu Xun underwent was the test of a firm and unyielding revolutionary fighter under the enemy's cruel policy of terror. It is not accidental that Comrade Mao Zedong particularly emphasized Lu Xun's revolutionary firmness, believing that "Lu Xun's bones are the hardest, he has no slavishness or obsequiousness, which is the most valuable character of the people of colonies and semi-colonies."

    Comrade Mao Zedong's words are meaningful. In China, where class struggle has always been very sharp and complex, and in China, where the revolutionary cause is particularly difficult and arduous, a revolutionary's loyalty and firmness to the revolutionary cause are particularly important, and at the same time, they inevitably have to undergo various ruthless tests. Lu Xun was tested in this way, and he did not forget to use his own valuable experience to educate the younger generation.

    Lu Xun said in his speech "Opinions on the Left-Wing Writers League":

    "In the struggle against the old society and the old forces, we must be resolute, persistent, and pay attention to strength. The foundation of the old society is very solid, and the new movement cannot shake it without greater force. And the old society also has good ways to make the new forces compromise, but it will never compromise itself. There have been many new movements in China, but each time the new could not defeat the old. The reason is mostly that the new side does not have resolute and broad goals, and the demands are very small and easy to satisfy."

    Does Lu Xun's view seem to have become a thing of the past today? Of course, the old society and the old forces represented by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism have been overthrown by us. This is fundamentally different from the situation Lu Xun was in at the time. But it is still far from completely eliminating the influence of this old society and old forces, and we still have the enemy of imperialism abroad, and the old forces of capitalism at home. Fighting against these old forces is still a serious task at present. What Lu Xun said twenty-five years ago is still completely applicable to this struggle. Without the spirit of "must be resolute and persistent" that Lu Xun mentioned here, without vigilance against the enemy's constant desire to make the "new forces compromise," and without a correct understanding of the revolutionary task, it is impossible to defeat the old forces of capitalism and impossible to complete our task of socialist revolution.

    But the facts are before us. In recent years, due to the victory of the revolution, due to the achievements of literary and artistic work, and the expansion of its mass influence, and due to the relatively peaceful environment in which writers live, some people have experienced ideological degeneration and deterioration. Among them, the most noteworthy is the idea of pride and complacency. The pride and complacency of a small number of Party member writers has developed to the point of opposing the supervision of the Party and the masses, and refusing criticism from others and self-criticism. This situation should arouse our vigilance.

    Lu Xun said, "The old society also has good ways to make the new forces compromise, but it will never compromise itself." Isn't the degeneration and deterioration of some of our literary and artistic workers the result of the old society making us compromise, isn't it the actual proof of Lu Xun's estimate?

    Lu Xun's idea that the revolution "must be resolute and persistent," the idea of "tenacity," is precisely the idea of carrying the revolution through to the end. It was with the idea of carrying the revolution through to the end that Lu Xun opposed the idea of pride and complacency, and the idea of giving up halfway. According to Lu Xun's idea, we cannot be satisfied and stop moving forward just because the Chinese democratic revolution has been victorious and Chinese literature has achieved some success. China is a culturally backward country, and the contribution in literature and art is far inferior to the actual revolutionary struggle. If China should not be proud even after completing great achievements in the revolution, then isn't it even more unfounded for some literary and artistic workers to become proud because they have achieved some success?

    But those who are proud and complacent always exaggerate their personal role. They not only cannot correctly and calmly estimate their own achievements, but also cannot correctly and calmly estimate all the objective conditions that have enabled them to achieve some success and reputation. These people often think that they have done everything, and do not allow others to criticize them. If such a person is a Party member writer, it is hard to imagine that he will not ideologically leave the Party and develop to the point of confronting the Party.

    Those who are proud and complacent do not seem to consider the difficult and complex nature of literary and artistic work itself, and do not consider that literary and artistic labor is complex labor, and that literary and artistic career is a difficult career. Many great genius writers in history often felt that personal strength was weak, and felt that even if they had given their all, they had not already done everything, and had not made what had already been done perfect. One of the main signs of a great genius writer is the full recognition of the difficult and complex nature of the literary career, and thus a greater recognition of the necessity of diligence and humility. Balzac said, "A small amount of work produces a large amount of conceit, a large amount of hard work produces unlimited humility." Indeed, what makes a great writer colorful is not pride, but humility, and it is often the relatively insignificant talents who are prone to pride and complacency. When we see the following passage from Lu Xun, and see that it is Lu Xun, such an unattainable writer, expressing such sincere humility, we should all feel ashamed:

    "We will be powerless to express too great changes, but this does not need to be pessimistic. Even if we cannot express its entirety, we can express a corner of it. Huge buildings are always stacked up with one piece of wood and one stone. Why don't we do this one piece of wood and one stone? I often do some odd jobs for this purpose." ("Lu Xun Letters," to Lai Shaoqi)

    Of course, "too great changes" should also be expressed, and we should have the confidence to express them after certain conditions are met. However, past facts have proved that it is precisely those humble people like Lu Xun and Balzac who can profoundly express many "too great changes." This fact is very clear.

    II

    In his "Opinions on the Left-Wing Writers League," Lu Xun also emphasized the necessity for writers to establish a revolutionary worldview, and opposed individualistic thinking, and opposed using literature as a tool for personal pursuit of fame and profit. This still maintains profound practical significance for us today.

    Lu Xun resolutely opposed the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois individualism within the revolutionary ranks. Lu Xun clearly saw that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois individualism was the ideological source of speculation, seizing power and profit, creating divisions, and other various bad and vulgar habits. Lu Xun called individualists "tumblers" and "people who step on two boats." Lu Xun saw clearly that they all started from personal interests and had no principles. Lu Xun described them this way: "Those who are quickly radical are also quickly peaceful, and even quickly decadent. If they are literati, they always have a reason to defend their changes, quoting scriptures and allusions. For example, when asking for help, they use Kropotkin's theory of mutual aid, and when they want to argue with others, they use Darwin's theory of survival competition." ("A Glimpse of Shanghai Literature and Art") Similar individualists, of course, have no real enthusiasm for the literary cause. They seize literature only for the purpose of seeking fame or profit. Lu Xun said in his "Opinions on the Left-Wing Writers League":

    "People on the literary front must also be 'tenacious.' The so-called tenacity means not using the method of 'knocking on the door' like writing eight-legged essays in the former Qing Dynasty. The eight-legged essays of the former Qing Dynasty were originally tools for 'entering school' and becoming officials. As long as one could do 'beginning, carrying on, turning, and combining,' and use them to enter the 'scholar's degree,' one could throw away the eight-legged essays, and would never use them again in one's life. So it was called 'knocking on the door,' just like using a brick to knock on the door. Once the door is knocked in, the brick can be discarded, and there is no need to carry it with you. Many people are still using this method to this day. We often see some people who have published one or two collections of poems or novels, and then they disappear forever. Where did they go? It is because they published one or two books, and gained a little or a big name, and obtained a professorship or some other position. Their work is completed and their fame is achieved, so they no longer need to write poems or novels, so they disappear forever."

    Has this kind of "knocking on the door" method disappeared in our literary and artistic circles today? No, since this kind of thinking is ultimately the idea of individualism, then for those who have not eliminated individualistic thinking, this kind of thinking will not completely disappear. In our revolutionary literary and artistic ranks, isn't the phenomenon of using literature as personal capital still need to be cleared with effort?

    If we are not afraid to face reality, then we should say that we also have phenomena similar to those pointed out by Lu Xun more than twenty-five years ago. We also have some writers who have disappeared after writing one or two (or even not one or two books) poems or novels. There are others who are still seen, but treat creation as if they were doing routine work, and have not received the due improvement for a long time. Of course, it would be simplistic and unrealistic to require every work published by a writer to be better than the previous one, but it is generally reasonable to require a writer to constantly improve. But some of our writers are the opposite. Often, over many years, the first work that made him famous is still the best. That is to say, after he wrote the first work that made him famous, he has been going downhill for many years. His work has lost the brilliance it once had, and he can only continue to maintain his position as a writer by relying on the previous work that made him famous.

    Literary labor is complex labor, and the literary career is a difficult career. If you do not have genuine enthusiasm for literature, do not have the determination to put in great labor, and do not have the spirit of "tenacity" required by Lu Xun, you cannot achieve much. Some writers will succeed when they still have full enthusiasm, have sufficient preparation for life, and have put in a lot of hard work in their literary career. Many writers' initial famous works were written under these conditions. But some people become famous, their personal goals are achieved, their past enthusiasm for the literary cause declines, and now if they want to write new works, they need to go back to life again. But going into life, especially going into life for a long time, requires the spirit of "tenacity" required by Lu Xun. If he finally does not have the spirit of "tenacity" required by Lu Xun, his creation will also decline, and his past starting point in creation will also be his peak, which is also very natural.

    Although, according to the needs of the country, our literary ranks still need to be expanded, and according to our current ranks, our achievements, including the achievements of creation and theoretical work, should also be greater. Here, there are naturally various reasons why our achievements cannot be greater, but the lack of the spirit of "tenacity" for the literary cause required by Lu Xun, and the lack of enthusiasm for the literary cause that comes from enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause, is also an important reason.

    认真向鲁迅学习
    ——纪念鲁迅先生逝世十九周年
    陈涌
    一
    二十五年前，当中国左翼作家联盟刚刚成立，中国无产阶级领导的革命文学队伍在组织上刚刚形成的时候，鲁迅便在中国革命文艺工作者面前提出了用无产阶级的思想来批判和改造资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的迫切的任务。鲁迅发表了他的“对于左翼作家联盟的意见”这个有名的讲话，这个讲话在现代中国文学上具有十分重要的意义。
    鲁迅这个讲话的重要意义至今没有成为过去，因为鲁迅在这里提出的，是中国文学斗争的根本的、长远的、广泛的任务。
    鲁迅在这个讲话里特别强调作家和革命实际结合，强调作家应该认识中国革命斗争的长期性和艰巨性，强调作家应该对革命有清醒的坚定的认识，强调把革命进行到底的思想，反对动摇妥协，反对半途而废。鲁迅的这种思想今天对我们还是有着深刻的教育意义的。
    鲁迅自己的一生表明他对于革命有着日益深刻的认识，表明他是这方面的一个伟大的榜样。大家都知道，和鲁迅同时代的人曾经不断地经历剧烈的分化，许多本来也曾经站在进步方面的人物由于经不起现实的考验而投到反动方面去了，或者消极了，这就是鲁迅所说的“有的高升，有的退隐……”，而鲁迅始终坚持着革命的立场。鲁迅所受到的考验是一个坚定不屈的革命战士在敌人残酷的恐怖政策下所受到的考验。毛泽东同志特别着重地指出鲁迅的这种革命的坚定性，认为“鲁迅的骨头是最硬的，他没有丝毫的奴颜和媚骨，这是殖民地半殖民地人民最可宝贵的性格”，并不是偶然的。
    毛泽东同志这几句话是意味深长的。在阶级斗争一向都十分尖锐和复杂的中国，在革命事业特别艰难困苦的中国，一个革命者对革命事业的忠诚、坚定是特别重要，同时又是不可避免地要经受各种无情的考验的。鲁迅是这样被考验过来了，并且他没有忘记用他自己的宝贵的经验教育年青的一代。
    鲁迅在他的“对于左翼作家联盟的意见”的讲话里说：
    “对于旧社会和旧势力的斗争，必须坚决，持久不断，而且注重实力。旧社会的根柢原是非常坚固的，新运动非有更大的力不能动摇它什么。并且旧社会还有它使新势力妥协的好办法，但它自己是决不妥协的。在中国也有过许多新的运动了，却每次都是新的敌不过旧的，那原因大抵是在新的一面没有坚决的广大的目的，要求很小，容易满足。”
    鲁迅这个看法在今天看来是否已经成了过去呢？当然，代表帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的旧社会和旧势力是已经被我们打倒了，这是和鲁迅当时所处的情况根本不同的，但现在距离完全肃清这个旧社会和旧势力的影响也还很远，而且，我们国外还有帝国主义这个敌人，国内还有资本主义这样的旧势力，和这个旧势力作斗争，还是当前一个严重的任务，鲁迅二十五年前说过的这段话，对这个斗争还是完全适用的。没有鲁迅在这里所说的“必须坚决，持久不断”的精神，没有对于敌人随时都想使“新势力妥协”的警惕，没有对于革命任务的正确的认识，是不可能战胜资本主义的旧势力，不可能完成我们的社会主义革命的任务的。
    但事实摆在我们面前，近几年来，由于革命的胜利，由于文艺工作获得了一些成绩，扩大了它的群众影响，由于作家的生活处于相对的和平的环境，有一部人便已经发生了思想上的蜕化和变质的现象，其中特别值得注意的是骄傲自满的思想。有少数党员作家的骄傲自满思想已经发展到反对党和群众的监督，拒绝别人的批评和自我批评的地步了。这种情形，是应该引起我们警惕的。
    鲁迅说，“旧社会还有它使新势力妥协的好办法，但它自己是决不妥协的”。我们一些文艺工作者的蜕化和变质，不正是旧社会使我们妥协的结果，不正是鲁迅这个估计的实际的证明么？
    鲁迅认为对革命“必须坚决，持久不断”的思想，“韧”性的思想，正是要求把革命进行到底的思想。鲁迅正是用把革命进行到底的思想，来反对骄傲自满的思想，半途而废的思想的。按照鲁迅这种思想，我们便不能因为中国的民主革命已经得到胜利，中国文学取得了若干成绩便满足，便停止前进。中国是一个文化落后的国家，文艺方面的贡献比起实际革命斗争来，是大有逊色的。如果中国革命已经完成了伟大的功业还不应该骄傲，那么，有些文艺工作者因为有了一些成绩便骄傲起来，不是更没有根据么？
    但是骄傲自满的人总是夸大自己个人的作用的，他不但不能正确地冷静地估计自己的成绩，而且不能正确地冷静地估计自己所以能够获得一些成绩和声誉的全部客观条件，这些人往往以为自己已经做到了一切了，不容别人再来批评了。这样的人如果是一个党员作家，他不从思想上离开党而发展到和党对抗的地步，这是很难想像的。
    骄傲自满的人似乎也不去考虑文艺工作本身的艰难和复杂的性质，不去考虑文艺的劳动是复杂的劳动，文艺的事业是艰难的事业。历史上许多伟大的天才的作家常常感到个人的力量是微弱的，感到个人即使付出了全部力量，还不是已经做到了一切，还不是使已经做到了的达到十全十美的地步的。伟大的天才的作家的主要标志之一便是充分地认识到文学事业的艰难复杂的性质，因而更加认识到勤奋和谦逊的必要。巴尔扎克便说过这样的话，“很少量的作品产生出多量的自慢心，多量的勤劳产生出无限的谦谨”。的确，使一个伟大的作家有声有色的，不是骄傲，而是谦谨，倒是常常比较渺小的人才容易骄傲自满的。当我们看到下面鲁迅这一段话，看到正是鲁迅这样一个不可企及的作家表现着这样真诚的谦谨，我们都是应该感到惭愧的：
    “太伟大的变动，我们会无力表现的，不过这也无须悲观，我们即使不能表现他的全盘，我们可以表现它的一角，巨大的建筑，总是一木一石叠起来的，我们何妨做做这一木一石呢？我时常做些另碎事，就是为此。”（“鲁迅书简”，致赖少麒）
    当然，“太伟大的变动”也应该去表现，在具备了一定的条件之后也应该有信心去表现的。但是，过去的事实证明，能够深刻地表现许多“太伟大的变动”的，正是那些像鲁迅，像巴尔扎克这样的谦谨的人，这事实是再清楚不过的。
    二
    鲁迅在“对于左翼作家联盟的意见”里也强调作家建立革命的人生观的必要，反对个人主义思想，反对把文学当成个人追求名利的工具，这对于我们今天同样是保持着深刻的现实意义的。
    鲁迅是坚决地反对革命队伍内部的资产阶级和小资产阶级个人主义思想的。鲁迅特别清楚地看到，资产阶级和小资产阶级个人主义思想是投机取巧、争权夺利、制造分裂以及其他各种恶劣庸俗风气的思想上的来源。鲁迅把个人主义者称为“翻筋斗的人”，“脚踏两只船的人”，鲁迅看清楚了他们一切都是从个人利益出发，毫无什么原则性，鲁迅这样描写他们：“激烈得快的，也平和得快，甚至于也颓废得快。倘在文人，他总有一番辩护自己的变化的理由，引经据典。譬如说，要人帮忙时候用克鲁巴金的互助论，要和人争闹的时候就用达尔文的生存竞争说。”（“上海文艺之一瞥”）类似这样的个人主义者，对于文学事业当然是没有真正的热情的，他们抓住文学不过是为了求名或者求利的目的。鲁迅在“对于左翼作家联盟的意见”里说：
    “在文学战线上的人还要‘韧’。所谓韧，就是不要像前清做八股文的‘敲门砖’似的办法。前清的八股文，原是‘进学’做官的工具，只要能做‘起承转合’，借以进了‘秀才举人’，便可丢掉八股文，一生中再也用不到它了，所以叫做‘敲门砖’，犹之用一块砖敲门，门一敲进，砖就可抛弃了，不必再将它带在身边。这种办法，直到现在，也还有许多人在使用，我们常常看见有些人出了一二本诗集或小说集以后，他们便永远不见了，到那里去了呢？是因为出了一本或二本书，有了一点小名或大名，得到了教授或别的什么位置，功成名遂，不必再写诗写小说了，所以永远不见了。”
    类似这种“敲门砖似的办法”，在我们今天的文艺界是否已经绝迹了呢？不，既然这种思想归根结柢是个人主义的思想，那末，在还没有肃清个人主义思想的人，这种思想也是不会完全绝迹的。在我们的革命文艺队伍里，把文艺作为个人的资本这种现象难道不是还需要用力加以清除么？
    如果我们不怕正视现实，那末，应该说，我们也有类似鲁迅还在二十五年以前所指摘的现象，我们也有一些作家写过一二篇（甚至还不是一二本）诗或小说以后，便不见了，另有一些人虽然还见，但对待创作也仿佛对待例行公事，长久没有得到应有的提高。当然如果要求一个作家后出的每一篇作品都比前一篇好，这会是简单化的不现实的，但一般地要求一个作家不断地提高总是合理的。但我们有些作家却相反，往往在许多年内，比较起来还是使他成名的第一篇作品最好，也就是说，在他写了使他成名的第一篇作品以后，他在许多年内都在走下坡路了，他的作品已经失去了先前曾经有过的光彩，他只能继续靠着先前那一篇使他成名的作品维持他的作家的地位。
    文学的劳动是复杂的劳动，文学的事业是艰难的事业。如果对于文学没有真正的热情，没有决心付出极大的劳动，没有鲁迅所要求的“韧”性的精神，是不能有多大成就的。有些作家，当他还有着饱满的热情，还有着足够的生活的准备，在文学事业上还下过一番苦功夫的时候，他是会得到成功的。不少作家最初的成名的作品都是在这种状况下写出来的。但有些人是因为成名了，个人的目的达到了，他过去对文学事业的热情衰退了，原来他有了生活的准备，现在如果要写出新的作品，便需要重新到生活中去，但到生活中去，特别是长期到生活中去，是要有鲁迅所要求的“韧”性精神的，如果他终于没有鲁迅所要求的“韧”性精神，他的创作也跟着衰退，他过去在创作上的起点同时就是顶点，也是十分自然的。
    虽然按照国家的需要说来，我们的文学队伍还是需要扩大的，而按照我们今天的队伍说，我们的成绩，包括创作和理论工作的成绩，也是应该更大的。在这里，使我们的成绩不能更大的自然有各种原因，但缺乏鲁迅所要求的对文学事业的“韧”性精神，缺乏由于对革命事业的热情而来的对于文学事业的热情，这也是一个重要的原因。
