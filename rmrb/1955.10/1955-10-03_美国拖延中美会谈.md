    US Delays Sino-American Talks

    The Sino-American ambassadorial talks reached an agreement on the repatriation of civilians on both sides on September 10th. People hoped that the talks would further discuss and resolve other practical issues on which the two sides have disputes, so as to contribute to the easing of tensions between China and the United States and the cause of maintaining world peace. However, recently, people cannot help but notice more and more signs hindering the progress of the talks.

    After the agreement on the repatriation of civilians on both sides was reached, American newspapers revealed news that "the United States is in no hurry to make further negotiations with Communist China proceed too quickly," and even said that "the United States is not in a hurry, Washington assumes that Communist China is more eager than we are to seek a solution."

    People also remember that US President Eisenhower said after the Four-Power Government Heads Conference that "I know for sure that the people of the world want peace. In addition, everyone else in Geneva also felt this desire of mankind. Therefore, there is a great pressure to make constructive progress, rather than just repeating the lifeless performance of the past, a negative performance."

    People cannot help but ask, how can the attitude of fearing that the Sino-American talks will proceed too quickly be reconciled with the world's people's desire for peace and the demand for the talks to make constructive progress? How can it be thought that this attitude is any different from a lifeless, negative performance?

    In order to promote the constructive progress of the Sino-American talks, the Chinese side has made efforts. In the Sino-American talks, at the first meeting after the agreement was reached on the repatriation of civilians on both sides, the Chinese representative put forward two appropriate topics, "the embargo issue" and "the issue of preparing for higher-level Sino-American negotiations," in accordance with the agenda of the agreement between the two sides. The Chinese representative also pointed out that the talks should enter into the discussion of these issues without delay, in order to contribute to easing the tensions between China and the United States. This is in line with the world's people's desire for peace. But if this positive effort is seen as "anxiety," or even attempted to be used as capital for blackmail, then it is impossible to achieve any other purpose than hindering the constructive progress of the talks.

    Just after the meeting in which the Chinese representative put forward the two topics, the US representative issued a public statement claiming that "it would be premature to discuss other issues before the agreement on the repatriation of civilians is fulfilled." Recently, American news agencies also reported that US diplomatic officials claimed that the US side would not begin actual negotiations on other issues in the talks until all Americans who had violated the law in China were released.

    The agreement statement on the repatriation of civilians on both sides in the Sino-American talks stipulates that each side will take appropriate measures to enable the other side's overseas Chinese to exercise their right to return to their country as soon as possible. Obviously, the cases of Americans who have violated the law in China must be reviewed and handled individually in accordance with Chinese legal procedures, based on the nature of their crimes and their performance. China has always adopted a lenient policy towards Americans who have violated the law. Only when relations between China and the United States are improved can China's lenient policy be even more lenient. For Americans who have violated the law, this is the only possible appropriate measure. American news agencies have revealed that before the Sino-American talks reached an agreement on the repatriation of civilians on both sides, the US side had requested in the talks that all Americans who had violated the law in China be released within a time limit, but this request was firmly rejected by the Chinese side. Such a request could not but be rejected by the Chinese side. It is the inviolable sovereignty of any country to handle foreign nationals who violate the law in accordance with the law. China will never agree to any demands that infringe upon its sovereignty. Since the agreement on the repatriation of civilians on both sides in the Sino-American talks was reached after the Chinese side firmly rejected this request that infringed upon Chinese sovereignty, then after the agreement has been reached, there is even less reason to repeat this request that infringes upon Chinese sovereignty. The threatening rhetoric that the US side will not begin actual negotiations on other issues in the talks until all Americans who have violated the law in China are released will obviously not have any effect on the Chinese side.

    The Chinese side is faithfully implementing the agreement. Law-abiding American overseas Chinese can leave China at any time as long as there are no outstanding civil cases. For those of them who have outstanding civil cases, the Chinese government also provides as much assistance as possible so that they can resolve these cases as soon as possible. For Americans who have violated the law, the Chinese government leniently handles them in accordance with their crimes and their performance during their sentences. This has been the consistent policy of the Chinese government, and this is precisely the spirit of the agreement between the two sides in the Sino-American talks. In the Sino-American talks, the Chinese side has notified the US side of the American overseas Chinese who have been approved to leave the country and the Americans who have violated the law who have been reviewed and granted early release and repatriation. They have also left China one after another. Since the beginning of the Sino-American talks, thanks to the appropriate measures taken by the Chinese side, thirty-three Americans have either returned or are about to return to the United States. As for the small number of remaining Americans who have violated the law, the Chinese side will continue to review them individually in accordance with Chinese legal procedures, and will notify the third country entrusted by the United States, namely the United Kingdom, of the results of the review. If the US side continues to use the implementation of the agreement as an excuse to obstruct the constructive progress of the talks, it will not only make the talks a lifeless and negative performance, but also will not be of any benefit to the implementation of the agreement.

    In fact, it is the US side that should make a positive showing in the implementation of the agreement. For a long time, the US government has prohibited Chinese students and overseas Chinese in the United States from returning to their motherland. Chinese students and overseas Chinese who have requested to return to their country have been subjected to various threats and persecutions. In the Sino-American talks, the US side admitted that many Chinese had applied to return to their country but were prevented from leaving the country by the US government. However, throughout the talks, not a single one of these many people has returned to China. After the Sino-American talks reached an agreement on the repatriation of civilians on both sides, the US State Department authorities claimed on September 20th that three Chinese had left the United States on September 17th. However, the US State Department also claimed at the same time that these three Chinese were the "last group" of Chinese students who had requested to return to their country.

    The US State Department admitted in a public statement on April 2nd this year that "some Chinese students are afraid to apply to the Immigration and Naturalization Service to leave the United States for fear of being rejected." Now, not only are there still many people in the Chinese who the US side admits have applied to return to their country but have been prevented from leaving the country by the US government who have not been able to return to their country, but also, according to the facts admitted by the US State Department itself, there are obviously still many Chinese in the United States who have been threatened and persecuted for a long time and still dare not request to leave the country and return to their country. It is precisely for this reason that it is necessary to stipulate in the agreement on the repatriation of civilians on both sides the arrangement for a third country. China has entrusted the Republic of India to assist Chinese in the United States to leave the country and return to their country. Now the agreement on the arrangement for a third country has just begun to be implemented, but the US State Department has actually said that the three Chinese who left the United States are the last group, which is obviously completely contrary to the spirit of the agreement between the two sides. There are many Chinese overseas Chinese in the United States, and whether they will be able to exercise their right to return to their country in the future will be a test of whether the US side is faithfully implementing the agreement.

    The constructive progress of the Sino-American talks depends on the efforts of both China and the United States. Because the Chinese side understands that the implementation of the agreement takes a certain amount of time, it has not allowed the US side's less than completely satisfactory performance in the implementation of the agreement to become an obstacle to the continuation of the talks. The two topics put forward by the Chinese side, "the embargo issue" and "preparing for higher-level Sino-American negotiations," also show its efforts to ease the tense situation between China and the United States. Lifting the embargo against China is a unanimous demand put forward by countries all over the world in order to develop trade. Preparing for higher-level Sino-American negotiations is not only a unanimous demand of the people of all countries, but also a suggestion of senior figures in American political parties. People have reason to demand that the US side fulfill President Eisenhower's promise in the Sino-American talks and abandon the lifeless and negative performance.

### 美国拖延中美会谈

    美国拖延中美会谈
    中美两国大使级会谈在九月十日对双方平民回国问题达成了协议，人们都希望会谈将进一步讨论和解决中美双方有所争执的其他实际问题，以便对中美之间紧张局势的和缓和维护世界和平的事业有所贡献。但是，最近人们却不能不注意到愈来愈多的阻碍会谈进展的迹象。
    双方平民回国问题达成协议后，美国报刊就透露出这样的消息，说是，“美国就不急于使同共产党中国举行的进一步谈判进行得太快”，甚至于说，“美国并不着急，华盛顿设想共产党中国比我们更急于求得解决”。
    人们还记得，美国总统艾森豪威尔在四国政府首脑会议结束后曾经说过，“我确知世界人民是希望和平的。此外，在日内瓦的其他每一个人同样感到人类的这种渴望。因此有一种很大的压力，要求作出建设性的进展，而不仅仅是重复过去那种无生气的表演，消极的表演。”
    人们不能不问，怎样能够把惟恐中美会谈进行得太快的态度同世界人民要求和平、要求会谈作出建设性进展的渴望调和起来呢？怎样能够认为这种态度同无生气的，消极的表演有任何的不同呢？
    为了促成中美会谈的建设性的进展，中国方面是作了努力的。中美会谈中，中国代表在双方平民回国问题达成协议后的第一次会议上，就根据双方协议的议程提出了“禁运问题”和“准备高一级的中美谈判问题”的两项适当的议题。中国代表并且指出，会谈应该不迟延地进入这些问题的讨论，以便对和缓中美之间的紧张局势作出贡献。这是符合于世界人民要求和平的渴望的。但是如果把这种积极性的努力看作是“着急”，甚至企图以此作为进行讹诈的资本，那末除了阻碍会谈的建设性的进展外，是不可能达到任何其他目的的。
    就在中国代表提出两项议题的会议后，美方代表发表了公开声明，声称“在达成协议的关于遣返平民的声明得到履行之前，讨论其他问题未免为时过早。”最近，美国通讯社还报道说，美国外交官员们声称，在中国犯法的美国人全部获得释放前，美方在会谈中将不开始对其他问题进行实际的谈判。
    中美会谈关于双方平民回国问题的协议声明中规定，各方将采取适当措施使对方侨民能尽速行使返回本国的权利。显然，在中国犯法的美国人的案件必须按照中国的法律程序，根据本人的罪行和表现，逐个审查处理。中国对于犯法的美国人一贯采取了宽大的政策。也只有在中美两国关系有所改进的情况下，才能使中国的宽大政策更为宽大。对于犯法的美国人来说，这是唯一可能的适当措施。美国通讯社曾经透露过，在中美会谈对双方平民回国问题达成协议前，美方曾在会谈中要求限期释放全部在中国犯法的美国人，但是这一要求为中国方面所坚决拒绝。这样的要求也是不可能不遭到中国方面的拒绝的。对于犯法的外国侨民，依法予以处理，这是任何国家不可侵犯的主权。中国决不可能同意任何侵犯自己主权的要求。既然中美会谈中关于双方平民回国问题的协议是在中国方面坚决拒绝了这种侵犯中国主权的要求后达成的，那末，在协议已经达成后，就更没有任何理由来重复这种侵犯中国主权的要求。所谓在中国犯法的美国人全部获得释放前，美方在会谈中将不开始对其他问题进行实际谈判的威胁论调，显然对中国方面不会起任何的作用。
    中国方面是忠实实施协议的。守法的美侨，只要没有未了的民事案件，随时都可以离开中国。对于他们之中有着未了民事案件者，中国政府也尽可能地予以协助，使他们能够早日结束这些案件。对于犯法的美国人，中国政府按照他们的罪行和在服刑期间的表现，从宽予以处理。这是中国政府一贯的政策，这也正是中美会谈中双方协议的精神。在中美会谈中，中国方面曾经通知了美方，已经批准离境的美国侨民和审查完毕予以提前释放和遣送出境的犯法的美国人。他们也已经陆续地离开了中国。自从中美会谈开始以来，由于中国方面所采取的适当措施，三十三名美国人已经或者即将回到美国。至于剩下的人数很少的犯法的美国人，中国方面也将按照协议，根据中国的法律程序，继续逐个予以审查，并将审查有结果者通知美国所委托的第三国，即联合王国。如果美方继续以执行协议为借口来阻挠会谈的建设性的进展，那不仅将使会谈成为无生气的、消极的表演，而且对协议的实施也不会有任何的好处。
    事实上，在执行协议的问题上应该作出积极表现的正是美国方面。长期以来，美国政府禁止在美国的中国留学生和中国侨民回到祖国。要求回国的中国留学生和中国侨民受到了种种威胁和迫害。在中美会谈中，美方承认有许多中国人曾经申请回国而被美国政府阻止不能离境。但是，在整个会谈期间，这许多人中却还没有一个人回到了中国。中美会谈对双方平民回国问题达成协议以后，美国国务院当局在九月二十日声称，三个中国人在九月十七日离开了美国。但是，美国国务院当局同时竟声称，这三个中国人是要求回国的中国学生中的“最后一批”。
    美国国务院在今年四月二日的公开声明中曾经承认：“有些中国学生由于害怕遭受拒绝而不敢向移民归化局申请离开美国。”现在，不仅在美方承认曾经申请回国而被美国政府阻止不能离境的中国人中还有许多人没有能够回国，而且根据美国国务院自己所承认的事实，显然还有许多在美国的中国人由于长期遭到威胁和迫害，至今还不敢提出离境回国的要求。正因为如此，所以有必要在双方平民回国的协议中规定出第三国的安排，中国委托了印度共和国协助在美国的中国人离境回国。现在第三国安排的协议刚刚开始实施，但是美国国务院却竟将三名离开美国的中国人说成是最后一批，这显然是完全违反了双方协议的精神的。中国在美国的侨民很多，今后他们是否能够行使回国的权利，将是对美方是否忠实实施协议的考验。
    中美会谈的建设性的进展，有赖于中美双方的努力。中国方面由于了解到协议的实施需要一定的时间，并没有使美方在执行协议中不能令人完全满意的情况成为会谈继续进行的障碍。中国方面所提出的“禁运问题”和“准备高一级的中美谈判”的两项议题也表现出了它为和缓中美紧张局势而作的努力。解除对中国的禁运是世界各国为开展贸易而提出的一致要求。准备更高一级的中美谈判不仅是各国人民的一致要求，而且也是美国政党高级人士的建议。人们有理由要求美国方面在中美会谈中实现艾森豪威尔总统的诺言，放弃无生气的、消极的表演。
