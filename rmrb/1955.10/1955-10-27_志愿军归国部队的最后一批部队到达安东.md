Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 26th. The last group of six divisions of the third batch of returning troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army arrived at Andong Railway Station at 12:50 on the 26th. More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in Andong City held a welcome meeting at the station.

Xiao Chun, Second Secretary of the Andong Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Tefu, Deputy Mayor of Andong City, and heads of various people's organizations in Andong City all came to the station to greet them.

After the welcome meeting, the welcoming crowd and the commanders and fighters of the returning troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army sang, danced, and celebrated to their hearts' content on the platform.

From October 10th to 26th, approximately 200 units including Andong City’s government organs, enterprises, and people's organizations sent representatives to the station to welcome them every day.

Xinhua News Agency, Sinuiju, 26th. The last group of six divisions of the third batch of returning troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has withdrawn from Korea through the Sinuiju rear port and returned to the motherland on the 26th.

The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission stationed in Sinuiju conducted a full inspection of the last train of the returning troops of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the morning of the 26th. Neutral Nations personnel entered each carriage, counted the departing military personnel, and checked the weapons and ammunition they were carrying. The inspection ended at 11:35 a.m. (Pyongyang time). After verification, the Swiss member serving as chairman on the day announced that the numbers of all personnel, weapons, and ammunition were exactly the same as the numbers on the written materials provided in advance by the Korean-Chinese liaison officer. After the inspection, the Korean-Chinese liaison officer announced to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that the personnel and equipment of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning troops originally planned to be withdrawn via the Sinuiju port had all been withdrawn from Korea.

During the seventeen-day inspection work from October 10th to 26th, the Korean-Chinese liaison officers stationed at the Sinuiju rear port and the personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning troops provided all necessary facilities and full cooperation and assistance to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The inspection work proceeded very smoothly. According to the results announced by the chairman of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission each time the inspection was conducted, no discrepancies in numbers occurred during the seventeen days, and the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission never raised any questions or requested a review.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Sinuiju, 26th. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army returning troops have received a large number of letters and telegrams of gratitude from the military and civilians in various parts of Korea.

The workers of the Sariwon Brick and Tile Factory wrote in their letter: The factory that the Volunteer Army helped us build has produced a large number of bricks and tiles for building houses. In the first few days of October, the production results of our "Korean-Chinese Friendship Group" increased by 17% compared with the same period in September. We must increase production efforts as a gift to welcome the return of the Volunteer Army. Tang Shengzhen, a female worker at the Sariwon Integrated Factory and winner of the national award, told the Volunteer Army returning troops in a letter that she had completed the annual production plan on July 10th this year, and she guaranteed to strive for a production achievement of 220% beyond the annual plan by the end of the year as a gift to the Volunteer Army. Korean children living in the Fengshan Nursery School, which was built with the help of the Volunteer Army, also wrote letters to the Volunteer Army returning troops. They said: "The pair of peace doves that the Volunteer Army comrades gave us on 'June 1st' International Children's Day last year have now grown strong and big. Every time we see it, we think of peace. Thank you to the Volunteer Army for their achievements in defending peace."

Officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army also wrote letters to the Volunteer Army returning troops. Kim I-in, a soldier of the People's Army, said in his letter: "We will always remember the indelible feats you established in our motherland's liberation war. We will more vigilantly strengthen our own power and fight to the end for the peaceful reunification of our motherland."
