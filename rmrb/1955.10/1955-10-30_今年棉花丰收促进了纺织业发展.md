    This Year's Bumper Cotton Harvest Promotes the Development of the Textile Industry
    (Our report) This year's bumper cotton harvest has promoted the production of the textile industry. After the new cotton went on the market, cotton yarn production has significantly increased. Compared with the average output of the first three quarters, the cotton yarn output of state-owned and joint state-private textile factories in the fourth quarter increased by 22%. In the fourth quarter, cotton cloth production will increase by 58 million meters, and printed and dyed fabrics will also increase by 26 million meters.
    In the second and third quarters of this year, due to insufficient raw cotton, factories could only operate 15 shifts per week. After the bumper cotton harvest, factories began to increase operating shifts from late October. Most areas have increased to 17 shifts.纱 mills in Southwest, Tianjin, East China, and Northwest China have increased to 18 shifts, and the operating speed of the machines has also been increased, which has enabled the factories to fully utilize their equipment capacity.
    The new cotton that went on the market this year is of good quality, generally grade four or five cotton, with long fibers and fewer yellow flowers, and the woven cloth has high strength and a white color. At the same time, the good quality and low impurity content of cotton will further improve the quality of cotton yarn and reduce the consumption of raw cotton.
    According to current estimates, due to the bumper harvest of raw cotton, production next year will be further improved. Most factories will be able to operate 18 shifts per week.

    今年棉花丰收促进了纺织业发展
    本报讯　今年棉花的丰收，推动了纺织业的生产。新棉上市后，棉纱产量有了显著的提高。各国营、公私合营纺织厂第四季度的棉纱产量和前三个季度的平均产量比较，提高了百分之二十二。在第四季度内，棉布将增产五千八百万公尺，印染花布也将增产二千六百万公尺。
    今年二、三季度，由于原棉不足，各厂每星期只能开工十五班。棉花丰收后，从十月下旬，各厂开始增加开工班次。一般地区都增至十七班。西南、天津、华东、西北各纱厂已增至十八班，而且提高了机器的运转速度，这就使各厂的设备能力得到充分的发挥。
    今年上市的新棉质量良好，一般都是四、五级棉，纤维长、黄花少，织出的布强力大，颜色白。同时，棉花的质量良好、杂质少，也将进一步提高棉纱质量，减少原棉用量。
    据目前估计，由于原棉丰收，明年的生产将得到更进一步的改善。大部分厂都将做到每星期开工十八班。
