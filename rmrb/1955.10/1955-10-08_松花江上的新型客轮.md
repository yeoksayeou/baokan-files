    New Passenger Ship on the Songhua River
    The "Beijing," the largest passenger ship on the Songhua River recently manufactured, has begun service between Harbin and Jiamusi.
    The cabins of the "Beijing" are more spacious and comfortable, and equipped with bathrooms and recreation rooms. The service personnel on board can also provide thoughtful service to passengers. Other passenger ships take more than thirty hours to travel from Harbin to Jiamusi, while the "Beijing" only takes twenty-four hours. Soviet experts, government workers, and other passengers who have traveled on this ship have expressed satisfaction.
    The "Beijing" is a passenger ship designed by the Harbin Shipbuilding and Repair Plant by studying the latest Soviet designs and using domestically produced steel. This passenger ship can carry more than 720 passengers.

    松花江上的新型客轮
    最近制成的松花江上的最大客轮“北京号”，已经开始在哈尔滨到佳木斯之间航行。
    “北京号”的船舱修造得比较宽畅舒适，并有浴室、游艺室等设备。船上的服务人员也能周到地为旅客服务。其他客轮从哈尔滨到佳木斯需要航行三十多个小时，“北京号”仅航行二十四小时。乘坐这艘客轮的苏联专家、机关工作人员和其他旅客，都表示满意。
    “北京号”是哈尔滨船舶修造厂学习苏联最新式样自己设计，并采用国产钢材制成的一艘客轮。这艘客轮可载旅客七百二十多人。
