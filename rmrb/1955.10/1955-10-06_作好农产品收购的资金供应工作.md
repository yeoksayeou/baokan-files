To do a Good Job in Providing Funds for Agricultural Product Procurement
The mid-season rice and cotton in the country have already entered the market, and the autumn crops are about to be harvested. The peak season for purchasing grain, oil crops, and cash crops has begun. Quickly doing a good job in providing funds for agricultural product procurement is an important guarantee for the smooth completion of agricultural product procurement tasks.

This year, due to the rapid development of agricultural production cooperatives, the implementation of the "three fix" policy for grain, and the promotion of cotton pre-purchase work, coupled with the national bumper harvest, farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain and agricultural products has greatly increased. This is an extremely favorable situation for this year's agricultural product procurement. At the same time, the national banks have prepared more procurement funds this year than in any previous year, and the industrial goods allocated by commercial departments to various places are also much more than last year. The procurement funds and materials have been reliably guaranteed. Therefore, it is not difficult to do a good job in this year's agricultural product procurement. The key issue now is to strive to improve work style and methods, and flexibly allocate and distribute existing funds and commodities, so as to ensure the smooth progress of fund supply and procurement work.

Since the unified purchase of grain in 1953, the Party committees and People's Committees in many places have accumulated a lot of experience in mastering fund supply and organizing procurement work. For example, the method of the Danyang County Committee and People's Committee of Jiangsu Province in leading the finance, banking, and trade departments to make overall calculations in order to meet the procurement peak season is a very good experience. They first calculated the increased monetary purchasing power in the hands of farmers based on typical surveys of the harvests of agricultural production cooperatives and farmers and the quantities of various agricultural products purchased by the state. Secondly, based on typical surveys of changes in farmers' needs, they calculated the overall account of the state's withdrawal of currency, including commodity supply withdrawal, recovery of matured agricultural loans, and absorption of farmers' savings. Finally, based on the above two accounts, they calculated the amount of currency that the bank needs to increase during the procurement peak season, and urged all parties to make comprehensive arrangements for the work. This approach has many benefits, because it checks and arranges the work of all parties through the organization of fund supply, which can not only correctly estimate and arrange agricultural product procurement work, but also make commodity supply work more planned, and also promote the collection of public bonds, the recovery of matured agricultural loans, and the strengthening of rural savings. This working method is worth learning by all localities.

However, in some individual areas, there is still a careless attitude of not paying attention to the supply of procurement funds, and as a result, although all the conditions are very favorable, things are still messed up. For example, the Lizhai cotton collection point in the Third District of Pingyuan County, Shandong Province, collected 1,797 catties of cotton on August 25th and paid out 686 yuan, leaving only 272 yuan in cash. Although the local bank business office and cotton collection station both had ample funds, they should have correctly estimated the procurement plan for the next day based on the characteristics of the rapid cotton market and promptly withdrawn funds from the cotton collection station. But they did not do so. On August 26th, 6,706 catties of cotton came on the market, and their funds were immediately insufficient, forcing twenty or thirty farmers to wait for payment, and finally issued 750 yuan in IOUs. Similar things have happened in other places. This practice is very detrimental to both the state and the farmers and must be stopped quickly, and it is entirely possible to stop it.

Some cadres think: "If we ask the farmers to carry the grain back, they will have to come back to sell it another day." "Farmers are not afraid that we will not be able to pay if the supply and marketing cooperatives issue IOUs." "It doesn't matter if we issue IOUs to agricultural production cooperatives, we are all one family on the socialist road." These ideas are incorrect. It should be pointed out that issuing IOUs is a violation of the state's financial policy and must be strictly prevented. The impact of interrupting procurement is even worse. After the summer and autumn harvests, farmers quickly sell agricultural products, which is a manifestation of supporting the state's unified grain and cotton procurement policy, and at the same time, it is for the need to purchase means of production and living. Agricultural product procurement departments should actively meet this need of farmers and oppose taking a bureaucratic and indifferent attitude towards the suffering of the masses.

The bank bears the primary responsibility for the supply of funds in agricultural product procurement, but to do this work well is not just a matter for the bank. Because the source of procurement funds, in addition to a portion of cash allocated by the bank, also relies on or even mainly relies on the currency withdrawn by state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives, and also relies on the timely recovery of agricultural loans and the absorption of farmers' savings deposits. Therefore, banks, state-owned stores, supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and procurement agencies must cooperate well and act in unison. This is an important issue to ensure the timely supply of procurement funds.

Although the funds decentralized by banks in various places this year are more abundant than in previous years, the distribution locations may not be completely adapted to the procurement situation. Therefore, there should be no relaxation in the allocation and supply of procurement funds. In previous years, the procurement of agricultural products and the supply of commodities in many places were handled concurrently by supply and marketing cooperatives. Supply and marketing cooperatives could use the currency withdrawn from sales to pay for procurement at any time. This year, because the procurement of grain and oil crops is handled by the procurement department itself, the bank should also organize the supply and marketing cooperatives to supply the currency withdrawn to the grain and oil crop procurement department locally. This year, new procurement and lending methods have been implemented for grain and agricultural products. Generally, loans are granted based on the actual procurement quantity. This is a good way to save funds and strengthen credit supervision. However, some local banks have been too strict in controlling advance loans, and the regulations requiring reports for loans are sometimes too mechanical. Some procurement units, after implementing the new lending methods, disregard the objective situation during the procurement period and compress inventory funds, resulting in affecting the supply of funds. These shortcomings should also be quickly overcome.

More than 80% of the funds required for the procurement of agricultural products rely on the currency withdrawn from the sale of industrial products to farmers. Therefore, state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives must check the commodity supply work during the peak season, actively expand the promotion of industrial products and the withdrawal of currency, and support the needs of procurement funds during the peak season. At present, some supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas underestimate the purchasing power of farmers during the peak season and have conservative views. Some places have excessively low inventories and out-of-stock commodities, which cannot withdraw currency in time. Attention should be paid to correcting these situations.

The total amount of agricultural loans issued this year has increased significantly compared to last year, and this year's harvests are better than last year. In order to supply agricultural product procurement funds and support agricultural production increases next spring, the agricultural credit departments of national banks, agricultural banks, and credit cooperatives must seize the recovery of matured agricultural loans. At the same time, national banks and credit cooperatives must promptly launch credit activities and encourage farmers to save. This year, the business of national banks has greatly developed, and the number of rural credit cooperatives has also developed to 150,000. As long as we actively publicize and mobilize among farmers and improve savings work, we will definitely be able to withdraw a large part of the funds through savings.

Strengthening the leadership of Party committees at all levels, especially the financial and economic departments of county committees, over the financial and economic departments is the key to doing a good job in providing funds for agricultural product procurement. The comrades of the financial and economic departments of the county committees must use their main efforts to lead the agricultural product procurement work, the industrial product supply preparation work, and the flexible allocation of procurement funds. Doing these tasks well can drive a series of tasks such as peak season market supply and the arrangement of rural private merchants, and can also create good conditions for further developing the agricultural cooperative movement and preparing for spring plowing production next year.

The conditions for agricultural product procurement and fund supply this year are very favorable. As long as we can overcome the careless and negligent attitude, strengthen cooperation and coordination among relevant departments, and actively improve the work style and methods, we will definitely be able to guarantee the supply of procurement funds and ensure the victorious completion of agricultural product procurement.

### 作好农产品收购的资金供应工作

    作好农产品收购的资金供应工作
    全国的中稻和棉花已经上市，大秋作物也即将收割，采购粮食、油料和经济作物的旺季已经开始了。迅速作好收购农产品的资金供应工作，是顺利地完成农产品收购任务的重要保证。
    今年由于农业生产合作社的迅速发展，粮食“三定”政策的贯彻，棉花预购工作的推广，加上全国大丰收，农民出售粮食和农产品的积极性大为提高，这是今年农产品收购条件极为有利的情况。同时今年国家银行所准备的收购资金比任何一年都充裕，商业部门调拨到各地的工业品也比去年多得多，收购的资金和物资都得到了可靠的保证。因此，作好今年农产品的收购工作是不困难的。当前的关键问题，就是要努力改进工作作风和工作方法，机动而灵活地调拨和分配已有的资金和商品，以便保证资金供应和收购工作的顺利进行。
    一九五三年粮食统购以来，许多地方的党委和人民委员会在掌握资金供应和组织收购工作方面，已经积累了不少的经验。例如江苏丹阳县委和人民委员会，为了迎接收购旺季，领导财政、金融、贸易等部门算大账的方法，就是一个很好的经验。他们首先根据对农业生产合作社和农民收获的典型调查和国家收购各项农产品的数量，算出农民手中增加的货币购买力。其次根据农民需求变化的典型调查，计算国家回笼货币的总账，其中包括商品供应回笼、收回到期农贷、吸收农民储蓄等项目。最后根据以上两笔账算出银行在收购旺季中需要增加投放的货币数字，并督促各方面把工作进行全面的安排。这样的做法好处是很多的，因为它通过资金供应的组织工作，检查和布置了各方面的工作，既可以正确估计和布置农产品收购工作，也可以使商品供应工作更有计划，还推动了催收公债、收回到期农贷和加强农村储蓄的工作。这种工作方法是值得各地好好学习的。
    但是，在个别地区目前也还存在着不重视收购资金供应工作的麻痹大意情绪，结果，虽然各种条件都很有利，仍然把事情办坏了。例如山东省平原县第三区李寨收棉点，八月二十五日收了一千七百九十七斤棉花，付出六百八十六元，只剩下现款二百七十二元。虽然当地银行营业所和收棉站都拥有充裕的资金，他们也本应根据棉花上市很猛的特点，正确估计第二天收购的计划，向收棉站及时取款。但是他们并没有这样作。八月二十六日那天，上市棉花一下到了六千七百零六斤，他们的资金顿时不够了，被迫叫二、三十个农民守候付款，最后还打出了七百五十元的白条子。类似这样的事情，在其它地方也曾发生。这种做法，对国家和对农民都是十分不利的，必须迅速停止，也是完全可以停止的。
    有些干部以为：“叫农民把粮食背回去，他改天还得来卖。”“供销合作社打白条子，农民并不怕我们付不起款。”“对农业生产合作社打白条子更没有关系，都是走社会主义道路的一家人。”这些想法都是不正确的。应该指出，打白条子是违犯国家金融政策的行为，必须严格防止。收购中断的影响则更加不好。农民于夏收、秋收之后，迅速出售农产品，是拥护国家粮食、棉花统购政策的表现，同时又是为了添置生产资料和生活资料的需要。农产品收购部门应该积极地满足农民的这种需要，反对对群众疾苦采取官僚主义的漠不关心的态度。
    农产品收购中的资金供应，银行负有首要的责任，但是要作好这项工作，却不单是银行的事。因为收购资金的来源，除了银行拨付的一部分现金外，还要依靠甚至主要依靠国营商业和供销合作社的回笼货币，也要依靠及时收回农贷和吸收农民的储蓄存款，因此，银行、国营商店、供销合作社、信用合作社和收购机关必须很好配合，行动一致，这是保证收购资金及时供应的重要问题。
    各地银行今年下放的资金虽比往年充足，但是分布地点不一定完全与收购的情况相适应，因此不应该丝毫放松对收购资金的调拨和供应工作。往年许多地方的农产品采购与商品供应工作，都由供销合作社兼办，供销合作社可以随时用销货回笼的货币来支付收购价款，今年由于粮食、油料采购由采购部门自行办理，因此银行还应组织供销合作社将回笼的货币，就地供应给粮食、油料采购部门。今年实行了对粮食和农产品新的采购放款办法，一般的都是根据实际的采购数量来贷放，这是节约资金、加强信贷监督的一个好办法，但是有些地方银行对于预付贷款控制过严，执行贷款必须有表报的规定有时过于机械；有些收购单位，在实行新的放款办法以后，不顾收购时期的客观情况，一味压缩库存资金，结果影响了资金供应。这些缺点，也应该迅速克服。
    收购农产品所需的资金，百分之八十以上是依靠向农民销售工业品回笼的货币。因此，国营商业和供销合作社必须检查旺季的商品供应工作，积极扩大工业品的推销和回笼货币，支持旺季收购资金的需要。目前有些地区的供销合作社对旺季的农民购买力估计不足，存在保守观点，有些地方库存压缩过低，商品脱销，不能及时回笼货币的情况，应该注意纠正。
    今年发放的农贷总额比去年增加很多，而今年年成比去年好，为了供应农产品收购资金，支持明春农业增产，国家银行的农业信贷部门、农业银行和信用合作社，必须抓紧收回到期农贷。同时，国家银行和信用合作社必须及时展开信用活动，鼓励农民积蓄。今年国家银行的业务有很大发展，农村的信用合作社也已发展到十五万个，只要在农民中积极宣传动员，并改进储蓄工作，就一定可以通过储蓄回笼很大一部分资金。
    加强各级党委特别是各县委财经部对财经部门的领导，是作好农产品收购资金供应的关键。各县委财经部的同志必须用主要力量来领导农产品的收购工作、工业品的供应准备工作和收购资金的机动调拨。这些工作作好了，就可以带动旺季市场供应、农村私商安排等一系列的工作，也可以为进一步发展农业合作化运动和准备明年春耕生产创造良好的条件。
    今年农产品收购和资金供应工作的条件是十分有利的，只要我们能克服麻痹大意的情绪，加强有关部门之间的配合协作，积极改进工作作风和工作方法，就一定能保证收购资金的供应，保证农产品收购的胜利完成。
