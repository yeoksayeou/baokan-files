    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 5th -- According to reports in the newspapers, insurgents in the Algerian mountains continue to clash with French troops. Agence France-Presse reported that twenty-five insurgents were killed in a clash in the Djebel Ammar region on September 27. On September 30, armed conflict occurred near El Milia, resulting in casualties as well. Algerian Governor-General Soustelle pointed out at a recent meeting of the government's special committee on North African affairs that the situation in Algeria, particularly in the Constantine Province, is "very turbulent."
    It has been announced in the newspapers that the special committee on North African affairs has decided to reinforce French troops in Algeria. At the same time, the French government has decided to implement some social and economic reforms in Algeria according to Soustelle's plan. French Prime Minister Faure recently announced: "Algeria must be fully integrated into France in the shortest possible time."
    The first part of Soustelle's reform plan has been submitted to the Algerian Assembly for discussion. As is known, the Algerian Assembly is composed of a French committee and a Muslim committee. According to Agence France-Presse, on September 26, forty-two of the sixty members of the Muslim committee resolved to declare their opposition to the policy of merging Algeria with France and to the reform plan proposed by Soustelle. The resolution of these members condemned the actions of blindly suppressing large numbers of innocent people, and pointed out that the so-called merger policy is now outdated, and the vast majority of Algerian residents support the national ideology of Algeria.
    After the members of the Muslim committee passed the above resolution, Soustelle announced the adjournment of the Algerian Assembly meeting. This news caused new controversy in the press and among parliamentary figures. "Combat" stated: "Almost all residents of Algeria oppose the plan to fully incorporate Algeria into the French Federation," and in order to solve the Algerian problem, "another solution should be sought."
    In a recent statement, the French Communist Party pointed out that the French Communist Party firmly advocates implementing a policy in Morocco and Algeria that respects the people's desire for freedom and independence, and implementing a policy that is in line with the true interests of France, which are not consistent with the interests of the colonists.

    阿尔及利亚山地起义者继续抗击法军
    阿尔及利亚议会当地议员反对苏斯戴尔改革计划
    新华社五日讯据塔斯社巴黎讯：据报纸报道，阿尔及利亚山区的起义者同法国军队继续发生冲突。据法新社报道，九月二十七日在江布尔—阿马尔区发生冲突时起义者有二十五人被打死。九月三十日在艾尔—米利附近发生了武装冲突，结果也有伤亡。阿尔及利亚总督苏斯戴尔在最近举行的政府北非事务特别委员会会议上指出，阿尔及利亚，特别是君士坦丁省，局势“十分动荡不安”。
    在报纸上已经宣布，北非事务特别委员会决定加强在阿尔及利亚的法国军队。同时，法国政府已经决定根据苏斯戴尔的计划在阿尔及利亚实施一些社会经济改革。法国总理富尔最近宣布：“在最短期间内要完全使阿尔及利亚成为法国的一个组成部分。”
    苏斯戴尔改革计划的第一部分措施已经提交阿尔及利亚议会讨论。大家知道，阿尔及利亚议会是由法国人委员会和回教徒委员会组成的。据法新社报道，九月二十六日回教徒委员会六十个议员中有四十二个议员决议宣布，他们反对阿尔及利亚同法国合并的政策，反对苏斯戴尔提出的改革计划。这些议员的决议谴责对大批无辜的人进行盲目镇压的行动，并且指出所谓合并的政策现在已经过时，绝大多数阿尔及利亚居民都拥护阿尔及利亚的民族思想。
    在回教徒委员会议员通过了上项决议之后，苏斯戴尔宣布阿尔及利亚议会会议延期。这个消息在新闻界和议会人士中引起新的争论。“义勇军报”说：“几乎阿尔及利亚全体居民都反对使阿尔及利亚完全成为法兰西联邦成员国的计划”，为了要解决阿尔及利亚问题“应当寻找另一种方案”。
    法国共产党在最近所发表的声明中指出，法国共产党坚决主张在摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚执行尊重人民要求自由和独立的愿望的政策，执行符合法国真正利益的政策，这种利益是同殖民者的利益不相符的。
