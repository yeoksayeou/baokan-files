　　Yang Jinquan has been exceptionally busy these past few days, as he is processing parts for the cylinder of the fifth 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine. This year, the Shanghai Turbine Factory completed the trial production of three 6,000-kilowatt steam turbines three months ahead of schedule. Now, all workers in the factory are working intensively to complete the new task of increasing production by two steam turbines this year. Yang Jinquan's enthusiasm is even greater than before. He often says to people with barely concealed joy, "Hey! Such big things, I haven't even seen them before, but now one, two... they are all made from our hands. Overcoming difficulties is victory, that's absolutely right!" Yang Jinquan's words really come from the bottom of his heart. During the trial production of the steam turbine, Yang Jinquan overcame numerous difficulties.
　　It started at the end of 1953. One day, Yang Jinquan was called to the workshop director's office. The workshop director patted Yang Jinquan on the shoulder and said, "Master Yang, sit down! I have good news to tell you: Our factory has accepted a major and glorious task—trial-producing China's first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine. If this steam turbine is successfully trial-produced, the electricity it generates can supply lighting for a city of 300,000 people; it can supply electricity for the production of eight machine factories with 2,000 workers each; it can power all the machines of a large textile factory producing 300,000 bolts of cloth per day. See, isn't this thing powerful!" Without waiting for Yang Jinquan to answer, the workshop director continued, "The steam turbine we are trial-producing is manufactured according to Czechoslovakia's advanced design standards, and the technical requirements are very high. In some places, the tolerance cannot exceed two or three 'si' (one 'si' is equivalent to about one-seventh of a hair's breadth). Now we are entrusting you with the task of processing the cylinder in the steam turbine."
　　Yang Jinquan started learning to be a turner at the age of ten. From his many years of labor, he deeply knows the value of electricity. He was surprised and delighted to hear the workshop director's words, but when he thought about his old vertical lathe and the high technical requirements of the new task he faced, he couldn't help but worry.
　　"Cannot be off by even one 'si'? I have never seen such a machine part. To process such a machine part, we need precision large boring machines and planers. My vertical lathe is old and has many problems. In the past, it took a lot of effort to process machine parts with a tolerance exceeding fifty 'si'. Now, to process a cylinder with a tolerance not exceeding two or three 'si', I'm afraid it's going to be really tough!" Yang Jinquan had a somewhat impatient temperament and spoke his mind as soon as he thought of it, expressing his opinion in one breath.
　　"Master Yang, don't worry! This task is certainly difficult, but we believe you can complete it. As long as you use your brain, old machine tools can also produce good products," the workshop director persuaded him, and gave detailed answers to the specific problems he raised.
　　Whether it was the workshop director's trusting tone that gave him confidence, or the news of manufacturing a 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine itself that gave him strength, when he returned to the vertical lathe from the workshop director's office, his steps were bigger and more forceful than usual.
　　On December 7th, a huge crane delivered a large cylinder weighing three tons and five feet high in front of Yang Jinquan's vertical lathe. From that moment on, he began a tense battle.
　　Before the cylinder was even processed, difficulties arose: the old vertical lathe was too old, the faceplate on the vertical lathe was uneven, and the vertical center split of the cylinder could not be corrected no matter what. Using the old method of using a square and a level to help correct it, it was correct at first, but when it rotated a radius, the tolerance exceeded the specified value again. The difference was only a few 'si'—a few fractions of a hair's breadth—but this was absolutely not allowed by the technical documents. One day passed, three days passed, Yang Jinquan climbed onto the machine, and climbed down from the machine, rotating from one side of the vertical lathe to the other, but there was no solution. At night, the comrades were all asleep, but Yang Jinquan still could not fall asleep.
　　He thought of his father who drifted on the Huangpu River, earning a living by punting a boat, of his wife's thin face when he was unemployed, and of his children's rosy faces now, his wife's hearty laughter from the bottom of her heart, and the trust and entrustment of the Party branch secretary, technical personnel, experts, and many comrades.
　　"Could it be that China's first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine will be held up in my old Yang's hands? No!"
　　"How fast the days are changing, but our production methods are still the same old way, how slow the improvement is. Why can't we think of a way to change it?" After Yang Jinquan posed this question to himself, it was like a shadow, always spinning in his mind, and he could no longer get rid of it. He thought: if the faceplate is uneven, don't use it, can't we modify it with a dial indicator (a type of instrument)? If a cylinder's circumference is 360 degrees, and it's not easy to correct the center split face, can't we do it in several times? If the large pressing plate is not easy to set up, can't we set up fewer of them, and support more underneath? Yang Jinquan told these ideas to the technical personnel, asking for their help. After scientific analysis by the technical personnel, and continuous thinking and improvement by everyone, the cylinder was correctly installed on the vertical lathe, and the tolerance did not exceed two 'si'.
　　The cylinder rotated on the vertical lathe for several months, from the cold winter to the hot summer. Yang Jinquan's work also entered the most intense stage—machining the sealing groove of the cylinder. This sealing groove is inside the cylinder, the groove is narrow, and even the depth of the cut cannot be seen. Working outside is like being blind, how can we guarantee that the work will not go wrong? So Yang Jinquan came up with another trick: use a dial indicator to locate, and use a mirror to reflect, and carefully engage in work based on the shadow reflected by the mirror. Later, he felt that these two methods could not completely guarantee quality, and he couldn't rest assured, so he simply climbed into the cylinder himself. The cylinder was spinning with a whooshing sound, and Yang Jinquan was like a part standing on the cylinder, also rotating. This kind of violent shaking that made him feel dizzy, even the person with the best body would feel dizzy, but he tried his best to calm himself and focused all his energy on watching the work of the turning tool to see if it was turning crooked.
　　In the hot summer of Shanghai, sometimes you still sweat when sitting indoors, let alone in an airtight cylinder. What's more, the cylinder is rotating so violently. Xiao Teng—Yang Jinquan's apprentice, standing on the overpass, saw that his master was in the cylinder, the sweat on his body was flowing like a small river, and his face was very bad. Xiao Teng knew his master's temper: when he was fully engaged in work, you couldn't pull him out even with several cows. But he was afraid that if his master couldn't support it, what would he do? This young man couldn't settle down anymore, so he had to shout anxiously above, "Master Yang, do you want to drink water?" "Master Yang, can I turn off the machine and you come up?" "Can I take over for you for a while?"
　　"Can't be replaced, this is a precise process, I'll come up after I finish this process." Yang Jinquan, squatting in the whooshing cylinder, didn't even lift his head. This old vertical lathe didn't even have an oil pump, so he had to watch the turning tool work and add oil to the machine at any time. Thirty minutes passed, an hour passed, two hours passed, and finally a groove was machined. Yang Jinquan breathed a sigh of relief and notified Xiao Teng to turn off the machine. Yang Jinquan climbed into the cylinder again and again like this. Once, when he climbed out of the hot, steamy cylinder, this strong worker fainted powerlessly. People forced him to go home and forbade him to come to the factory before his health recovered, but the next day, he appeared in the workshop again. It was with his wisdom and perseverance that Yang Jinquan machined the huge cylinder of China's first steam turbine. The new product made by this old machine was inspected by experts and found to be fully qualified.
　　This year, Yang Jinquan participated in the manufacture of the third 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine, and he installed four cutting tools on the vertical lathe, working on both sides, doubling the work efficiency. The vertical lathe has simply become a new type of lathe. Now, not only is Yang Jinquan a skilled operator of the vertical lathe, but even his two apprentices have become second-level technicians operating this machine. They are doing rough turning smoothly, and can also do some of the fine work. Yang Jinquan often said to his apprentices, "Now we can use old vertical lathes to make precision new products. In the future, it will be even easier to operate new machine tools. Don't look down on those old machines, there is no new without the old; without our vertical lathe, where would China's first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine come from?"

    用老机器制造精密的新产品
　　本报记者　习平
    杨金泉这两天格外忙碌，他正在为第五台六千瓩汽轮机的汽缸加工零件。今年上海汽轮机厂提前三个月完成了全年试制三台六千瓩汽轮机的任务，现在全厂工人正为完成今年增产两台汽轮机的新任务而紧张地工作。杨金泉的干劲儿比以前更足了。他常常掩不住内心的欢欣对人说：“嘿！这样大的东西，过去连看也没有看见过，现在居然一台，两台……，都从我们手里造出来了。克服困难就是胜利，这话真是一点也不错！”杨金泉的这句话，确实是从心眼里说出来的。在汽轮机试制过程中，杨金泉克服了重重的困难。
    那是从一九五三年年底开始的。一天，杨金泉被叫到车间主任办公室去了，车间主任拍着杨金泉的肩膀说：“杨师傅，坐下吧！我有件喜事告诉你：我们厂接受了一个重大而光荣的任务——试制我国第一台六千瓩汽轮机。这台汽轮机试制成功，它发出的电力可以供给三十万人口的城市照明；可以供给八个有两千工人的机器厂的生产用电；可以转动日产三十万匹布的大纺织厂的全部机器。你看，这家伙带劲不带劲！”没等杨金泉回答，车间主任接着又说：“我们厂试制的汽轮机，是按照捷克斯洛伐克的先进设计标准制造的，技术要求很高，有的地方公差不能超过二、三丝（一丝相等于一根头发的七分之一左右），现在我们要交给你的是汽轮机里的汽缸的加工任务。”
    杨金泉从十岁就学做车工，从多年的劳动生活中，深知电的宝贵。他听了车间主任的话，又惊又喜，但是当他想到自己的大立车已经老旧，而面临的新任务所要求的技术又这样高，不禁担心起来。
    “不能差一丝？这样的机件我看也没看过，要加工这样的机件，就得有精密的大型搪床、刨床。我的那部立车年纪大，毛病多，过去加工公差超过五十多丝的机件，都得费挺大的劲，现在要加工不超过公差二、三丝的汽缸来，我看实在够呛！”杨金泉的脾气有些急躁，想到哪里就说到哪里，一口气就把自己的意见说出来了。
    “杨师傅，你别急！这个任务当然困难，但是我们相信你能够完成。只要动脑筋，老车床也可以做出好产品来。”车间主任劝说他，又根据他提出的具体问题，作了详细的解答。
    不知道是车间主任十分信任的语气使他产生了信心，还是制造六千瓩汽轮机这个消息本身给他增加了力量，当他从车间主任办公室回到大立车旁的时候，脚步比平常走得更大，更有力。
    十二月七日，巨大的吊车将一个重三吨、高五尺的大汽缸送到杨金泉的大立车前面。从这个时候起，他就开始了紧张的战斗。
    汽缸还没有开始加工，困难就来了：老立车年纪太老了，立车上的花盘高低不平，汽缸的中分垂直怎样也校正不出来。用过去的老办法，使用角尺和水平尺来帮助校正，开始对了，但转一个半径，公差又超过规定了。相差虽只有几丝——一根头发的几分之几，但是，这是技术文件所绝对不允许的。一天过去了，三天过去了，杨金泉爬上机器，又从机器上爬下来，从立车这边转到立车那边，一点办法也没有。夜里，同志们都睡着了，杨金泉还是不能入眠。
    他想起过去漂泊在黄浦江上，依靠撑船营生的父亲，想到自己失业时候妻子黄瘦的脸和现在孩子们的红润的脸，妻子从心底发出来的爽朗的欢笑，以及党支部书记、技术人员、专家和许许多多同志们的信任和嘱托。
    “难道就让新中国的第一台六千瓩汽轮机在我老杨手里搁下来吗？不能！”
    “日子变得多快，可是我们的生产方法还是老样子，改进得多么慢。为什么不能想办法变一变呢？”当杨金泉把这个问题向自己提出以后，它就像影子似的，老是在他脑子里打转转，再也不能摆脱了。他想：花盘不平，不用它，改装一只靠表（一种仪表）不可以吗？一个汽缸圆周三百六十度，不容易校正中分面，分几次来做不可以吗？大压板不容易搭，少搭一些，下面多支撑一些不可以吗？杨金泉把这些主意告诉技术人员，要求他们帮助。经过技术人员科学的分析，经过大伙不断地想法改善，汽缸就被他正确地安到大立车上去了，公差没有超过两丝。
    汽缸在大立车上转了几个月，从严寒的冬天到炎热的夏天，杨金泉的工作也跟着进到最紧张的阶段——车汽缸的封槽。这条封槽在汽缸的内部，槽狭，连吃刀深浅都看不见，站在外边干活，简直就像睁眼瞎子一样，这怎能保证活儿不出错？于是杨金泉又想出一个窍门：用靠表来定位，用镜子去反射，凭着镜子反射出来的影子，小心地从事工作。后来，他感到这两种办法都不能完全保证质量，放心不下，就索性自己爬进了汽缸里。汽缸在呼呼地转，杨金泉就像站在汽缸上的一个零件似的，也旋转起来。这种天旋地转的剧烈震动，身体最好的人也会晕眩，但是他极力地镇定自己，用全副精力注视着车刀的工作，看它是否车歪了。
    上海的盛夏，有时坐在室内还要出汗，何况是在密不通风的汽缸里。又何况汽缸又在这样猛烈的旋转。站在天桥上的小滕——杨金泉的徒弟，看到师傅在汽缸里，身上的汗像小河一样往下淌，脸色很不好看。小滕深知他师傅的脾气：当他全心投入工作后，用几头牛也拉不出来。但他怕万一师傅不能支持了，又怎么办呢？这个年轻人再也安不下心来，只好在上面焦急地喊：“杨师傅你要喝水吗？”“杨师傅我关车你上来好吗？”“我可以代你工作一会儿吗？”
    “不能替换，这是一道精密的工序，我车完这道工序就上来啦。”蹲在呼呼地旋转着的汽缸里，杨金泉头也不抬。这部老旧的立车连油泵设备都没有，他一面看着车刀工作，一面还得随时给机器添油。三十分钟过去了，一点钟过去了，两个钟头过去了，终于一道槽车出来了，杨金泉才松了一口气，通知小滕关车。杨金泉就是这样一次再次地爬进汽缸。有一次，当他从热腾腾的蒸笼似的汽缸里爬出来的时候，这个身体强壮的工人，竟无力地晕倒了。人们强迫他回家，不准他在健康没有恢复以前来工厂，可是第二天，他又出现在车间里。杨金泉就是这样凭着他的智慧和坚毅，车出了我国第一部汽轮机的庞大汽缸。这部老旧机器做出来的新产品，经专家鉴定，质量完全合格。
    今年，杨金泉参加制造第三台六千瓩汽轮机，他又给大立车装上了四把刀子，分成两面工作，工作效率提高了一倍，大立车简直变成了新型的车床。现在，不仅杨金泉是大立车熟练的操纵者，连他的两个徒弟也成为操纵这部车子的二级技工了，他们粗车干得挺顺当，细活也能做一部分。杨金泉经常对他的徒弟说：“我们现在能用老立车做出精密的新产品，以后操纵新工作母机就更顺当了。你们不要看不起那些破旧机器，没有旧的就没有新的；没有我们这部大立车，哪里来我们新中国第一台六千瓩的汽轮机呢？”
