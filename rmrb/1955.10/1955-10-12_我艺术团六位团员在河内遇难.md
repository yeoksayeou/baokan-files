Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th: On the afternoon of the 5th, members of the Chinese Art Troupe were boating on the scenic West Lake in Hanoi when they were struck by a sudden rainstorm, capsizing several boats. Thanks to the valiant rescue efforts of residents along the lake and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army, most of the comrades on the overturned boats were rescued. Tragically, six members of the Chinese Art Troupe, Zhong Xiaonan, Jiang Naihui, Li Cheng, Liu Keqin, Jin Junqiang, and Bai Chunpei, perished.

Following this accident, responsible comrades and representatives from the Vietnamese Labor Party, the government, the National Assembly, and the Fatherland Front personally visited the residence of the Chinese Art Troupe to express their condolences. A solemn funeral was held for the deceased on the afternoon of the 6th. On the evening of the 6th, the Ministry of Culture of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a memorial service for the six comrades, including Zhong Xiaonan.
