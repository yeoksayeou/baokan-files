Xinjiang's various reclamation areas are beginning autumn afforestation

The Xinjiang Agricultural Production Corps is about to start large-scale autumn afforestation work. In the past few years, the Xinjiang Agricultural Production Corps has built more than 12,700 mu of shelterbelts and timber forests in various reclamation areas in southern and northern Xinjiang (including the afforestation area this spring), of which the area of shelterbelts reached 8,100 mu. These shelterbelts, the taller of which are already about ten feet high, are initially playing a role in preventing wind and protecting fields. With the progress of the farm planning work of the corps and the expansion of the cultivated area, the afforestation area this autumn will reach more than 13,000 mu, which is more than the sum of the afforestation area in the past few years. Depending on the different climates of the reclamation areas, it will be started in late October and early November. The corps has prepared more than 21 million seedlings of various types, which is enough for this year. In order to prepare for afforestation, many units have leveled the forest land in conjunction with farm planning, and have conducted deep soil surveys and soil leaching. In order to improve efficiency and save time, the afforestation method of assembly line operation will be promoted. In the three reclamation areas of Urumqi, Manas River Basin, and Yanqi, six tree planting machines will also be used for mechanical afforestation.

    新疆各垦区开始秋季造林
    新疆农业生产部队即将开始大规模的秋季造林工作。过去几年，新疆农业生产部队已经在南北疆各垦区营造防护林、用材林一万二千七百多亩（包括今年春季造林面积），其中防护林面积达八千一百亩。这些防护林，高的已有一丈左右，初步地起着防风护田的作用。随着部队农场规划工作的进展和耕地面积的扩大，今年秋季造林的面积将达一万三千多亩，比过去几年造林面积的总和还要多。根据各垦区气候的不同，分别在十月下旬和十一月上旬着手进行。部队已准备了各种苗木二千一百多万株，足够今年采用。为了作好造林准备工作，很多单位结合农场规划已平整了林地，进行了土地深测和土壤洗碱。为了提高工效，争取时间，将推行流水作业的造林方法。在乌鲁木齐、玛纳斯河流域、焉耆等三个垦区，还将出动六台植树机进行机械造林。
