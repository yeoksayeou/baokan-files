Bumper Harvest Scenes from Agricultural Production Cooperatives

This autumn, across our vast land, there are scenes of bumper harvests everywhere. The vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives have achieved bumper harvests, allowing the broad masses of peasants to see the superiority of agricultural collectivization with their own eyes, and more sincerely support the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural collectivization, further inspiring the broad masses of peasants to advance confidently on the road of agricultural collectivization.

In order to strive for this year's bumper harvest, members of agricultural production cooperatives and the broad masses of peasants, under the leadership of the Party and the government, have made tremendous efforts. This spring, the "State Council's Resolution on Spring Ploughing Production" and the grain three-fixed policy were thoroughly implemented throughout the country; agricultural production cooperatives were universally consolidated and rectified, labor forces were rationally organized, land was effectively utilized, and the area of cultivated land was expanded; the state supplied peasants with a large number of production materials such as agricultural implements and fertilizers; a large number of agricultural loans were issued, and technical extension organizations were established, greatly boosting the production enthusiasm of cooperative members and the broad masses of peasants. Coupled with this year's natural conditions, which were generally better than last year, and the large-scale and effective disaster relief efforts carried out by the broad masses of peasants in some disaster-stricken areas, the disaster area was reduced to a minimum. In this year's autumn harvest, many agricultural production cooperatives adopted new-style threshing machines, and some even organized youth grain-picking teams to increase grain harvest, striving to sell more grain, cash crops, and sideline products to the state to support national industrialization.

The fertile Chengdu Plain, in the years after liberation, the Party and the government vigorously led the people to continuously renovate and expand the Dujiangyan water conservancy project, enabling millions of acres of rice to reap bumper harvests for six consecutive years.

    农业生产合作社的丰收景象
    今年秋天，在我们幅员广大的国土上，到处是一片丰收景象。绝大部分农业生产合作社获得了丰收，使广大农民亲眼看到了农业合作化的优越性，更加衷心拥护共产党和毛主席关于农业合作化的指示，进一步鼓舞着广大农民信心百倍地在农业合作化道路上前进。
    为了争取今年的丰收，农业生产合作社社员和广大农民在党和政府领导下，做了巨大的努力。今年春季，全国各地深入贯彻了“国务院关于春耕生产的决议”和粮食三定政策；对农业生产合作社普遍地进行了整顿巩固工作，合理地组织了劳动力、有成效地利用了土地和扩大了耕地面积；国家大量供应农民所需要的农具、肥料等生产资料；发放了大批农业贷款以及建立了技术推广组织等等措施，大大鼓舞了合作社社员和广大农民的生产积极性。加上今年的自然条件，一般要比去年好，部分受灾地区，由于广大农民进行了规模巨大的有效的抗灾斗争，使成灾面积减缩到最小限度。今年秋收工作中，许多农业生产合作社采用了新式打谷机，有的还组织了青年拣粮队，增加了粮食的收获量，争取把更多的粮食、经济作物和副业产品卖给国家，支援国家工业化建设。
