    Tang Yongqing Creates Rice-Catching Pipe
    Ye Shitao, Yin Chongjing

    Tang Yongqing, a renovation worker at the state-owned Shanghai No. 5 Rice Mill, successfully created a rice-catching pipe.

    In the workshops of the state-owned Shanghai No. 5 Rice Mill, one can see elevators carrying white rice swiftly upwards. Because the elevators rotate too quickly, any rice grains that aren't completely emptied immediately fall back down, dropping into the pulley and being crushed into broken grains or powder. This loss has continued for many years.

    In April of this year, when Shanghai launched a grain conservation campaign, this factory put forward the slogan of increasing the rice yield rate. Tang Yongqing thought about solving the problem of rice grains falling back down from the elevators. He constantly researched with technicians and rice mill workers. After more than a month of effort and three experiments, he created a trunk-like "rice-catching pipe": using two long lead pipes installed at the top of the elevator to catch the rice grains that fall back down, preventing them from falling into the pulley and being crushed. Initial tests showed that after installing the "rice-catching pipe" on each elevator, more than thirty catties of rice could be saved per day and night.

    Now, all twenty-five rice mills in Shanghai are widely promoting this method, and one hundred and eight elevators have already been equipped with "rice-catching pipes." It is estimated that the city can mill over one million catties of rice more for the country each year.

    唐詠清创造的接米管
    叶世涛　尹崇敬
    国营上海第五碾米厂装修工唐詠清创造接米管成功。
    在国营上海第五碾米厂的车间里，人们可以看到一座座升降机带着白米飞快地往上升送。因为升降机回转太快，没有倒净的米粒立刻又回下来，掉进皮带盘里被轧成碎粒或粉末。这个损失，多少年来一直继续着。
    今年四月间上海市开展节约粮食运动，这个厂里提出了提高出米率的号召。唐詠清就想着要解决升降机回下米粒的问题。他不断地和技术员、碾米工人们研究。用了一个多月时间，经过三次试验，他创造出了一种象鼻式“接米管”：用两根长的铅皮管装进升降机的上端，接住那些回下来的米粒，使不再掉进皮带盘被碾碎。经初步试验，每座升降机装上“接米管”以后，一昼夜可以避免损失大米三十多斤。
    现在全上海市二十五个碾米厂，正在普遍推广这种方法，已经有一百零八座升降机装上了“接米管”。估计全市一年可为国家多碾出大米一百多万斤。
