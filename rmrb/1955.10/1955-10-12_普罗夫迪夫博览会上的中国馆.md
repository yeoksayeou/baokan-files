At the Plovdiv Fair, I was told a moving story before I came to Plovdiv:

    One day, the Chinese Exhibition Hall closed early because of a reception. At this time, an old Bulgarian woman came to the door and asked to be allowed to visit. The staff explained the reason and advised her to come back tomorrow.

    However, the old woman refused to leave, saying: "I came from afar. If I don't see it today, it will delay my return home tomorrow. I am old, and if I don't see Chinese things this time, I may never see them again!"

    Her earnest words were touching. The Chinese pavilion reopened for her.

    Who is this Bulgarian mother? Where did she come from? Why does she have such a great interest in China? These questions often circle in my mind.

    After I left Sofia and came to Plovdiv, I immediately went to the comrades of the Chinese Exposition Working Group to inquire. It really excited me that there was more than just this one touching story. For example, an old man from Plovdiv visited the Chinese pavilion three times in a row. He told the Bulgarian translator about his great intentions and instructed him to tell the Chinese comrades.

    Bulgarians from the northern Dobruja Plain, from the southern Rhodope Mountains, and from the eastern Black Sea coast, gathered in Plovdiv by train, bus, and sometimes on foot.

    The number of people visiting the Chinese Pavilion cannot be counted separately. September 10th - the second day of the Bulgarian National Day holiday, there were especially many people, and the ropes protecting the exhibits in the exhibition hall were broken.

    The great interest of Bulgarians in China is understandable. Before leaving the Chinese pavilion, the visitors excitedly wrote their impressions in the guestbook. Every word of these impressions was full of enthusiasm, which was deeply moving. For example, some of them used such short sentences to sing:

    "Good, China!"

    "Excellent, brothers!"

    "Bulgaria is proud to have great Chinese friends!"

    The guestbook records nearly a thousand impressions, but you cannot calculate it by a thousand people, because many impressions are written in the name of groups. If we summarize these impressions, their changes in mood during the visit to the Chinese Pavilion are: "Surprised" by the speed of development of New China in the past three years, "moved" by the diligence, patience, and wisdom of the Chinese working people, and also "reluctant to leave" because of the rich and colorful exhibits in the Chinese Pavilion.

    Here is the Chinese Pavilion. The entrance is decorated with: the national emblem of the five stars shining on Tiananmen, beautiful painted ridges, red pillars, and golden lions, which are the unique style and colors of China that everyone is familiar with.

    Walking through the gate, passing through the Sino-Bulgarian Friendship Hall—where pictures and explanations showing Sino-Bulgarian friendship are hung—we come to a rectangular hall, where 2,700 exhibits are displayed in the hall and on the outer right corridor. Chairman Mao's magnificent half-length statue is placed in the center of the north end of the hall, facing the large embroidered image of Dimitrov from afar. Fifteen large lanterns hanging from the ceiling illuminate the hall, and pleasant Chinese music is constantly playing...

    In the minds of Bulgarians, China is a distant country with a large population, vast land and abundant resources, and an ancient culture. They are concerned about the achievements of New China's socialist construction. People who come to the Chinese Pavilion want to know what new exhibits China has displayed this year.

    People crowded in front of the showcases and machines of heavy industrial products, and they discovered the rapid achievements of New China on the road to industrialization. After seeing it, a machine technician recalled: "Three years ago, I visited your exhibition, and the industrial level was still low. Now I see motors, machine tools, etc., which makes me sincerely happy. I wish you continued rapid development."

    Bulgarians say that the victory of the Chinese people in building socialism is also the victory of the Bulgarian people. They congratulate China on its new achievements. Workers from the famous Lenin Metallurgical Plant warmly congratulated China on the rapid development of steelmaking and machinery manufacturing; miners from the Rhodope coal mining area wrote "Salute to Chinese coal miners!"

    The audience visited the Chinese exhibits with great interest, from machine tools and steel to motorcycles and bicycles, from silk to carpets, from ivory carvings to cloisonné, from rich fruits to the Guanting Reservoir project model...

    For eleven years, the Bulgarian people have been building a socialist mansion, and their material life and cultural needs are constantly improving. This is also an important reason why they are so interested in Chinese exhibits.

    Bulgarians like the silk and fabrics displayed here very much. Fabrics with beautiful patterns and colors can make women, girls, and children look more beautiful. The windows are often crowded with people, gesticulating and praising the exhibits with beautiful words. A group of girls wrote in the guestbook: "How many hearts like ours can't find words to describe the Chinese Pavilion! - We have returned to the door, and then walked back. The beautiful silk of the Chinese Pavilion will always shine and grab our hearts."

    The audience also stopped to admire the ivory carvings, porcelain, embroidery and other handicrafts in the windows. A visitor from Stalin City on the Black Sea wrote: "I brought my family to visit the Chinese Pavilion. I like the carvings and fabrics the most. Their patterns and colors are very natural and artistic." Roupdov, an old man of seventy-four years old, said that he was very moved after seeing the Chinese silk, porcelain, and ivory carvings. Another visitor described the artistic image of China as "inspiring the poet's soul".

    Everyone sees what they like here, for example, Chinese leather shoes or pens, Chinese musical instruments or bicycles. It is impossible to list them one by one. Let me quote a sentence from a philatelist to end. Vasily Tsaikov, Chairman of the Bulgarian Philatelic Science Association, wrote: "I am glad to see the small stamp exhibition. Their themes, artistry and technical quality can satisfy even the most special philatelists."

    The enthusiastic praise of Bulgarians for the Chinese Pavilion cannot be finished, but they also have ardent expectations: hoping to see Chinese-made locomotives and cars at the next expo, and also hoping that China can introduce some ancient culture, or hold a Chinese music exhibition, and be able to sell Chinese records... All these praises and encouragements are growing into the strongest thing, which is the more consolidated and developed brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people.

    Please see the friendship between Chinese spinning mill girls and Bulgarian spinning mill girls. When the spinning wheel displayed in the exhibition hall started to turn, a Bulgarian female worker walked out of the crowd surrounding it and asked Chinese comrades to exchange experience on yarn breakage joining methods. The Chinese female worker Li Guiqin warmly received her and humbly exchanged production experience with her. In order to thank Li Guiqin, the Bulgarian female worker gave her her sun visor. Li Guiqin also gave her a Chinese embroidered handkerchief as a souvenir. The sincere friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian sisters deeply moved people, and the Bulgarian female translator who helped Li Guiqin translate was moved to tears.

    Similarly, here is another thing that reflects the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people. The Chinese Exposition Working Group received a letter written by a Bulgarian who had visited the Chinese Exhibition Hall. His name is Bo Dumanov. Dumanov wrote in his letter on September 12: The achievements of the Chinese Pavilion in industry, economy, culture and art make me happy. Everyone commented that this is the victory of the country with the most people in the world.

    Dumanov attached a small white flower to the letter, which the locals call the "Balkan Star". According to Bulgarian friends who are familiar with this flower, this flower grows in the steep places in the mountains, and people have to go through hardships to pick it. Dumanov not only sent the Chinese comrades this flower with special meaning, but he also prepared to send a bottle of Bulgarian famous plum wine. He said that this bottle of wine has been preserved for twenty-five years.

    This enthusiastic Bulgarian asked the Chinese comrades to tell him the address so that he could send the precious gift.

    When this newsletter was sent out, the Chinese comrades were writing back! (Sent from Plovdiv) (Attached picture)

    普罗夫迪夫博览会上的中国馆
    普金
    在来普罗夫迪夫以前，曾有人告诉我这样一件动人的故事：
    那一天，中国展览馆因为举行招待会，提早时间闭了馆。这时，一位保加利亚的老太婆来到门口，她要求让她进去参观。工作人员说明理由，劝她明天再来。
    但是，那位老太婆却不肯离开，她说：我是从远方来的，今天不看，要耽误明天回家。我年岁老了，这次看不到中国东西，也许看不到啦！
    她的恳切言词，使人感动。中国馆为她重又开放。
    这位保加利亚老母亲是谁呢？她打那儿来的呢？她对中国为什么能有这样大的兴趣呢？这些问题经常在我的头脑中打圈子。
    当我离开索非亚来到普罗夫迪夫以后，我便马上去找中国博览工作团的同志打问。真是使我兴奋，原来像这样动人的故事不只这一个。比如说，普罗夫迪夫市的一位老头儿一连三天来中国馆看了三次，他把自己的这种盛意告诉保加利亚籍的译员，并且嘱咐他转告中国同志。
    保加利亚的人从北部多布鲁查平原，从南部的罗多彼山区，从东部黑海边，坐火车、乘汽车、有时还要步行，汇集到普罗夫迪夫来。
    到中国馆来参观的人数是无法单独统计的。九月十日——保加利亚国庆节假期的第二天，来的人特别多，把展览馆大厅里围护展品的绳子都挤断了。
    保加利亚人对中国的巨大兴趣是可以理解的。来客们在离开中国馆以前，激动地在留言簿上写上了自己的观感，这些观感，每个字都洋溢着热情，使人深深感动。例如，他们有的用这样简短的字句来歌颂：
    “好，中国！”
    “好极了，兄弟！”
    “保加利亚因为有伟大的中国朋友而骄傲！”
    留言簿上记录了将近一千条观感，但是你不能以一千个人来计算，因为有不少观感是以团体的名义写的。如果把这些观感概括一下，他们在参观中国馆过程中的心情变化是：看到新中国近三年来的发展速度而“惊讶”，为中国劳动人民的勤劳、忍耐、智慧而“感动”，也为中国馆丰富多采的展品而“留恋不舍”。
    这里是中国馆。大门口装饰着：五星照耀着天安门的国徽、艳丽的画栋、红色的大柱、金黄色的狮子，这是人人熟悉的中国特有的风格和色彩。
    走进大门，穿过中保友谊厅——这里张挂着表示中保友谊的图片和说明文字——来到长方形的大厅，在这里和外面右廊上陈列着二千七百种展品。毛主席的雄伟的半身塑像放在大厅的北端正中，遥对的是季米特洛夫的大毛绣像。十五盏悬挂在天花板上的大灯笼照亮着大厅，悦耳的中国乐曲在不断放送……
    在保加利亚人心目中，中国是一个遥远的、人口众多、地大物博而有古老文化的国家，他们关心新中国社会主义建设的成就。到中国馆来的人都要知道中国今年展出了什么新展品。
    人们拥挤在重工业产品的橱窗和机器跟前，他们发现了新中国在工业化道路上迅速的成就。一个机器技术员看过以后，回忆道：“三年以前，我曾参观过你们的展览，那时工业水平还低。现在看见了电动机、工具机等，这使我衷心愉快，祝你们继续快速地发展。”
    保加利亚人说，中国人民建设社会主义事业的胜利，也就是保加利亚人民的胜利。他们为中国新的成就祝贺。从著名的列宁冶金工厂来参观的工人，热烈地祝贺中国炼钢和机器制造业的迅速发展；从罗多彼煤矿区来的矿工写着“向中国煤矿工人致敬！”
    观众怀着巨大的兴趣参观中国的展品，从机床、钢铁到摩托车、自行车，从丝绸到地毯，从象牙雕刻到景泰蓝，从丰富的水果到官厅水库工程模型……
    十一年来，保加利亚人民在建设着社会主义大厦，他们的物质生活和文化需要正在不断提高，这也是他们对中国展品如此感到兴趣的一个重要原因。
    保加利亚人很喜欢陈列在这里的丝绸、布匹。图案和色彩好看的织品能够把女人们、姑娘们和儿童打扮得更漂亮。橱窗前常常拥满了人，指手划脚地用美丽的字眼来称赞展品。一群姑娘在留言簿上写道：“有多少颗心像我们一样找不出语言来形容中国馆！——已经回到门口了，又走了回去，中国馆的美丽丝绸将永远发出光芒，抓住我们的心。”
    观众也为看到橱窗中的象牙雕刻、瓷器、刺绣等手工艺品而停下脚步来惊叹着欣赏这些展品。一个从黑海边斯大林城来的参观者写道：“我带着一家人来参观中国馆，最喜欢雕刻和布匹，它们的图案和色彩都很自然和艺术。”鲁普多夫是位七十四岁的老年人，他说他在看过了中国的绸缎、瓷器、象牙雕刻后非常感动，另一位参观者形容中国的艺术形象“使诗人的心灵也要激动”。
    各人在这里看到各人喜欢的东西，譬如说，中国的皮鞋或者钢笔，中国的乐器或者自行车，要一一列出来是不可能的，让我引一段集邮家的话来结束。保加利亚集邮科学协会主席瓦西利·蔡可夫写道：“我高兴能看到小小的邮票展出。它们的主题、艺术性和技术质量能满足甚至最特殊的集邮家。”
    热情的保加利亚人对中国馆的称赞固然是写不完的，他们同时也抱着殷切的期望：希望在下次博览会上能看到中国造的火车头、汽车，也希望中国能介绍一部分古文化，或者举行中国音乐展览会，并且能出售中国唱片……这一切称赞和勉励中成长着一个最坚强的东西，这就是中保人民更加巩固和发展的兄弟般的友谊。
    请看，中国纺纱女工同保加利亚纺纱女工间结成的友谊。当陈列在展览大厅中的纺车转动起来的时候，在围着的人群中，走出来一个保加利亚女工，她要求中国同志交流断纱接头法的经验。中国女工李桂琴亲热地接待她，谦虚地同她交谈生产经验。保加利亚女工为了感谢李桂琴，便把自己的遮光镜送给她。李桂琴也送她一条中国绣花手帕做纪念。中保姐妹间的真挚友谊深深地感动了人们，帮助李桂琴翻译的保加利亚籍女译员激动得掉下泪来。
    同样，这里还有一件反映出中保人民间兄弟友情的事。中国博览工作团收到了一封信，这信是一个参观过中国展览馆的保加利亚人写的，他的名字叫伯·都曼诺夫。都曼诺夫在九月十二日的信中写道：中国馆展出的工业、经济、文化和艺术的成就使我高兴，大家都评论这是在世界上有着最多人民的国家的胜利。
    都曼诺夫在信中附寄来一朵小白花，当地人把这花叫做“巴尔干之星”，据熟悉这花的保加利亚朋友说，这花生长在山上险峻的地方，人们要经历艰险才能摘到它。都曼诺夫不仅给中国同志送来了这朵具有特别含义的花朵，他还准备寄一瓶保加利亚闻名的李子酒来。他说这一瓶酒已经保存了二十五年之久。
    这位热情的保加利亚人要求中国同志把地址告诉他，以便他把珍贵的礼物寄来。
    当这篇通讯寄出的时候，中国同志正在写回信呢！　（寄自普罗夫迪夫市）（附图片）
