Hegang Coal Mine's Xing'antai vertical shaft, currently under construction, has recently adopted reinforced concrete supports instead of I-beam metal supports in its tunnel engineering. This can save the country a significant amount of steel and funds.

The rock tunnels leading from the bottom-hole yard of the Xing'antai vertical shaft to various locations were connected in June of this year. According to the design, I-beam metal supports should be used in the rock tunnels, requiring a large amount of steel. More than one thousand meters of rock tunnels would require more than one thousand five hundred sets of metal supports, totaling three hundred and seventy-five tons of I-beams. During the anti-waste struggle, Assistant Engineer Chen Youji and Technician Liu Xingyi, referring to Soviet experience, proactively proposed a suggestion to trial-produce reinforced concrete supports to save steel. This suggestion received the support of Soviet expert Bogomolov, who also provided technical guidance. In late August, the reinforced concrete supports were successfully trial-produced. After technical appraisal, the reinforced concrete supports could completely replace the I-beam metal supports in terms of technical and quality requirements. Five hundred reinforced concrete supports have now been produced and have begun to be sent into the rock tunnels for erection. According to preliminary calculations, each I-beam metal support requires 120 kilograms of steel, while the reinforced concrete support only requires 36 kilograms of steel. The use of reinforced concrete supports can save about 70 percent of steel, and the cost can also be reduced by 51 percent.

    鹤岗兴安台竖井节约金属支架
    正在兴建中的鹤岗煤矿兴安台竖井，最近在巷道工程中采用钢筋混凝土支架代替工字钢的金属支架，可为国家节约大量钢材和资金。
    兴安台竖井井底车场通往各处的岩石巷道在今年六月间贯通。按照设计，在岩石巷道中应采用工字钢金属支架，需要大量钢材，千多公尺的岩石巷道，就需要金属支架一千五百多付，合工字钢三百七十五吨。在反浪费斗争中，助理工程师陈有继、技术员刘行毅参考苏联经验，主动提出试制钢筋混凝土支架以节约钢材的建议。这项建议得到了苏联专家鲍格莫洛夫的支持，他并进行了技术上的指导。八月下旬，钢筋混凝土支架试制成功，经技术鉴定，钢筋混凝土支架在技术和质量要求上完全可以代替工字钢金属支架。现在已经制成钢筋混凝土支架五百个，并已开始送入岩石巷道进行架设。据初步计算，每个工字钢金属支架需钢材一百二十公斤，钢筋混凝土支架仅需钢材三十六公斤，采用钢筋混凝土支架可以节省钢材百分之七十左右，成本也可以降低百分之五十一。
