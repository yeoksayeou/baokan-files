Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 9th. According to a report by the German News Agency: On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party wrote a letter to President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic, expressing congratulations.

The letter pointed out that the first worker-peasant state on German soil has achieved great successes in internal and foreign affairs. This is the result of the efforts of the united working class and the National Front of Democratic Germany, and the result of a policy of peace and maintaining solid friendship with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries.

The letter stated: "West German workers recognize the German Democratic Republic as a solid bulwark against German militarism and a solid foundation for the national and democratic revival of Germany. This is because the policy of the German Democratic Republic—the only sovereign German state—serves the interests of all German people, and this policy also embodies their future and social progress for the workers of the Federal Republic. We are convinced that the forces of peace and democracy in West Germany and those who advocate easing international tensions will be able to promote negotiations between the Federal Government and the Government of the German Democratic Republic."

The letter continued: "The existence, development, and activities of the German Democratic Republic encourage workers, peasants, and all patriotic forces in West Germany to intensify the struggle against German militarism, and encourage them to strive for a fundamental change in the policy of the Federal Republic, in order to pave the way for the peaceful restoration of German unity on a democratic basis."

    德共中央致函皮克总统祝贺民主德国国庆
    新华社柏林九日电　据德意志通讯社消息：在德意志民主共和国成立六周年的时候，德国共产党中央委员会写信给德意志民主共和国总统皮克表示祝贺。
    这封信指出，在德国国土上的第一个工农国家在内政和外交方面取得了极大的成就。这是团结一致的工人阶级和民主德国全国阵线努力的结果，这是和平和同苏联和人民民主国家保持巩固友谊的政策的结果。
    信中说：“西德劳动者认定德意志民主共和国是反对德国军国主义的巩固堡垒，是争取德国的民族和民主复兴的坚实基础。这是因为德意志民主共和国——唯一有主权的德意志国家的政策是为全体德国人民的利益服务的，这种政策对联邦共和国劳动者来说，也体现了他们的前途和社会进步。我们深信，西德和平和民主的力量以及主张缓和国际紧张局势的人，将能促使联邦政府同德意志民主共和国政府举行谈判。”
    这封信接着写道：“德意志民主共和国的存在，它的发展和活动，鼓舞着西德的工人、农民和所有爱国力量加紧进行反对德国军国主义的斗争，鼓舞着他们争取联邦共和国的政策的根本改变，以便为在民主的基础上和平恢复德国统一的事业扫清道路。”
