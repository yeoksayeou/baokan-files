To the Editor:

    The industrial injury situation at the Jiuda Salt Company, a joint state-private enterprise in Zigong City, Sichuan Province, is extremely serious. In the first half of this year alone, there were 211 accidents, with 201 workers injured, accounting for more than 12% of the total number of workers in the factory. Most of these accidents were caused by unreasonable labor organization, excessive workloads for workers, and poor labor protection.

    The company's leaders have turned a blind eye to the frequent accidents. For example, in July of this year, the First Salt Plant had an electric shock accident, injuring seven people and killing one. Chen Zhimin, the Party Branch Secretary of this workshop, not only did not investigate the cause of the accident but instead blamed the workers for being careless. Among some of the personnel directly in charge of production, there is also a wrong idea that "we will be criticized by the higher authorities if we fail to complete the task, so a few industrial injuries are nothing." Some even say: "If someone gets injured, we'll just spend some money on medical expenses and hire a substitute."

    Certain leaders of the company have also adopted a delaying or even ignoring attitude towards the reasonable demands of the workers. For example, the labor organization in the round-pan salt-making workshop of the Fourth Salt Plant is very unreasonable, and some workers have to work more than twelve hours a day. When the workers raised their opinions, the Party Branch Secretary Zhong Hongwu said, "That's just how it is, no one can solve it." Also, the houses where the workers of the Eighth Brine Well live have very poor sanitary conditions, and even the water they drink is smelly. When the workers raised their opinions, the administration ignored them. When workers requested hot water for haircuts, the administration believed that this would increase production costs and refused to solve the problem. Due to the lack of attention to hygiene, 67% of the workers at the Eighth Brine Well became ill in May, and medical expenses alone amounted to more than 300 yuan.

    I believe that the leaders of the Jiuda Salt Company should quickly correct this erroneous attitude of not caring about safe production and workers' lives.

### 久大制盐公司的领导人员应关心安全生产和工人生活

    久大制盐公司的领导人员应关心安全生产和工人生活编辑同志：
    四川省自贡市公私合营久大制盐公司的工伤事故非常严重，今年上半年就发生事故二百十一次；受伤的工人二百零一人，占全厂工人总数的百分之十二以上。这些事故，大部分是由于劳动组织不合理、工人劳动负荷过重以及劳动保护不好等原因所造成的。
    这个公司的领导人员，对事故频繁的情况却熟视无睹。例如，第一制盐处在今年七月间发生了一次触电事故，七人受伤，一人死亡，这个车间的党支部书记陈智民不但不检查这次事故发生的原因，反而责怪工人粗心大意。在有些直接领导生产的人员中间还有这样一种错误想法，认为“完不成任务要受上级批评，发生点工伤事故没有啥”。有的人甚至说：“受了伤，花点医药费，请个代班的就行了。”
    公司某些领导人员对工人的合理要求也采取了拖延甚至置之不理的态度。例如，第四制盐处圆锅制盐车间的劳动组织很不合理，有一部分工人每天要工作十二小时以上。工人们提出意见，党支部书记钟洪武却说：“就这样，哪个来也解决不了。”又如，八卤井工人们住的房子卫生条件很差，连喝的水也是臭的，工人们提出意见，行政上却不闻不问；工人们要求在理发时准备些热水，行政上认为这会加大生产成本，就不给解决。由于不注意卫生，八卤井在五月份有百分之六十七的工人生了病，医药费就花了三百多元。
    我认为，久大制盐公司的领导人员应该迅速纠正这种不关心安全生产和工人生活的错误态度。
