    How Beitian Township, Yuci County, Prepared for Establishing Cooperatives
    Zhen Yi, Guo Feng
    In the latter half of August this year, the cooperative movement in Beitian Township, Yuci County, Shanxi Province, made further progress: frameworks for four new cooperatives were set up, and six of the seven old cooperatives expanded by a total of fifty-nine households. The proportion of peasant households participating in cooperatives throughout the township has risen from 40 percent to 59 percent.
    Perhaps some people will ask: In such a short period of time, new cooperatives were established and old cooperatives expanded. Does the Beitian Township Party Branch have any "shortcut" in this regard? Or did they adopt coercive measures? Neither is the case. So, how did they establish and expand the cooperatives? In short, in addition to running the original cooperatives well, they mainly conducted thorough preparatory work for establishing cooperatives.

    Planning for the Entire Township

    Last year, Beitian Township established two agricultural production cooperatives, Yangliang and Dajianan. Both were well-run. Yangliang Cooperative's per-mu yield increased by 15 jin of grain compared to the township's average, and Dajianan Cooperative's per-mu yield increased by 12 jin. This increase in production led many people to ask to join the cooperatives. Last winter, the Beitian Township Party Branch, based on the demands of the masses and the specific conditions of the township, led the two old cooperatives to expand their membership on the original basis; also, in the five blank villages of Beitian, Zhanghu, Tianjiao, Xiaoqi, and Nantian, one new cooperative was established in each; in addition, forty-three mutual aid teams were reorganized.

    After expanding and establishing cooperatives, eighteen mutual aid teams signed up and reserved to transition to cooperatives. Based on this situation, the Party Branch adopted the method of proposing targets from top to bottom and deliberating and discussing from bottom to top, and formulated a plan for developing cooperatives this year: In Beitian, Tianjiao, and Zhanghu villages, where the proportion of peasant households participating in cooperatives was less than 30 percent, four new cooperatives would be established; in the three old cooperatives of Dajianan, Yangliang, and Xiaoqi, where the proportion of peasant households participating in cooperatives had reached more than 80 percent of the total number of households in the village, the focus would be on consolidating and improving them, seeking development on the basis of consolidation; the remaining four old cooperatives would each develop about 15 households. The eighteen mutual aid teams that actively requested to transition to cooperatives were cultivated as target groups for this year's transition. In this way, there was a plan for the entire township: how many new cooperatives would be established? How large would they be? Which old cooperative would expand? How much would it expand? Which mutual aid team would join which cooperative? Which mutual aid teams would merge to form a cooperative? Not only did the leadership have a clear idea, but the masses also had a general understanding.

    Leading Teams with Cooperatives

    Last winter, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in Beitian Township increased from two to seven, and more than forty mutual aid teams underwent reorganization, which laid a good foundation for the cooperative movement throughout the township. How to consolidate the established cooperatives and continuously improve the large number of mutual aid teams became a new issue in the Party Branch's leadership methods. In order to adapt to this new situation, the Party Branch conducted multiple studies on leadership methods and unanimously agreed that it was necessary to use the form of a mutual aid and cooperation network to lead, and to adopt the method of leading teams with cooperatives, in order to consolidate and improve mutual aid and cooperation organizations and cultivate target groups for transitioning to cooperatives. Thus, a mutual aid and cooperation network was established. Under the leadership of the Party Branch, meetings were held twice a month, attended not only by the chairmen of the cooperatives, but also by the leaders of the transition target groups. The meetings mainly exchanged work experience and studied work methods. The Party Branch also designated Dajianan Cooperative as the central cooperative, making it take the lead in various tasks, create experience, and promote it comprehensively. In addition, the seven cooperatives and the eighteen mutual aid teams preparing to transition to cooperatives also established a regular contact system. Members of these teams also attended the political lessons held by each cooperative once a month.

    In addition to helping the mutual aid teams politically and ideologically, the cooperatives also frequently provided guidance on production technology. This spring, during the drought resistance and moisture preservation efforts, the Zhang Sini mutual aid team in Zhanghu Village did not know how to use a wooden roller to compress the land, and the Pang Quan mutual aid team in Dajianan did not understand cotton planting techniques. The cooperatives sent technicians to provide specific guidance to these two teams. During sowing, the Chang Gaiwang mutual aid team's fifty mu of millet were planted three times but failed to sprout. The season had reached the summer solstice, and the team members had run out of seeds, facing the risk of barren land. The Zhanghu Village Cooperative lent them 150 jin of seeds, ensuring timely sowing. When the Zhang Sini mutual aid team was harvesting wheat and weeding seedlings, conflicts arose within the team over work allocation and competition for time. Chen Chengyi, the vice chairman of the cooperative in this village, personally went to the mutual aid team to help, allowing everyone to conduct democratic discussions and, based on the urgency of various farm tasks, arranging the order of work. The problem was solved. In addition, in every production activity, the cooperatives used their own exemplary actions to lead the mutual aid teams to carry out competitions, which greatly promoted production. Under the promotion of the mutual aid and cooperation network, the method of leading teams with cooperatives was adopted, which not only consolidated the old cooperatives and strengthened the relationship between cooperatives and teams, but also improved and consolidated the mutual aid teams. Fifteen of the eighteen transition target groups identified last winter have officially transitioned to cooperatives after the efforts of the spring and summer seasons. All seventeen temporary mutual aid teams in the township have been upgraded to year-round mutual aid teams, and five of the eleven year-round mutual aid teams have implemented planned production and small-scale contracting.

    Doing a Good Job in Production

    Leading the mutual aid teams to do a good job in production is a central link in preparing for the transition to cooperatives. Therefore, since the spring of this year, the Party Branch has strengthened its production leadership over the mutual aid teams. At the beginning of spring plowing, many mutual aid teams believed that the spring was long this year and that farm work could be done slowly. The Party Branch mobilized everyone to formulate spring plowing production plans, and also helped the eighteen mutual aid teams preparing to transition to cooperatives to formulate annual production plans. Then, through the mutual aid and cooperation network, the experience of Dajianan Cooperative in carrying out basic farmland construction was introduced, and the teams were organized to conduct on-site observations at Dajianan Cooperative. This promoted the spring plowing production of each team. According to statistics from the eighteen mutual aid teams preparing to transition to cooperatives, this spring they built a total of 1,600 field borders and embankments, dug 16 canals, and created 200 mu of raised fields. Before sowing, the Xu Yongchang mutual aid team in Tianjiao Village spread more than 100 dan of wasteland soil per mu. When the "Xiaoman" solar term arrived, there was a drought and no rain. The cooperative led the mutual aid teams to carry out the work of carrying water to plant cotton. The township's task of sowing more than 1,400 mu of cotton was successfully completed. General mutual aid teams only hoed autumn land twice, while the mutual aid teams and cooperatives preparing to transition to cooperatives hoed it three times. Due to the leadership of the cooperative, the teams also gradually established economic ties. The eighteen mutual aid teams preparing to transition to cooperatives collectively managed 140 mu of high-yield land, jointly purchased 19 buckets, 13 walking plows, 2 waterwheels, 9 sprayers, and 2 carts. The members of the Zhang Jiabao mutual aid team in Zhanghu Village were all willing to buy a double-wheeled double-furrow plow, but their economic strength was insufficient. They consulted with the Zhang Sini mutual aid team to jointly purchase it. The Zhang Sini team agreed, saying, "Let's buy it! After the autumn harvest, we will be one family." In the process of deliberating on establishing a cooperative, the enthusiasm for production in the two teams became even greater. In production, the collectivist ideology and enthusiasm for building cooperatives of the mutual aid team members increased.

    Cultivating Backbone

    In order to run a cooperative well, in addition to the concerted efforts of all members, having a certain leadership backbone is a decisive factor. The Beitian Township Party Branch has paid great attention to cultivating backbone over the past year. The method adopted was to organize all cooperative cadres and mutual aid team backbone to learn how to run cooperatives in daily production activities through the mutual aid and cooperation network. Among the eighteen transition target teams, forty-nine mature backbone members have been cultivated, six of whom meet the requirements for joining the Party. The Party Branch committee members first learned how to run cooperatives. Comrade Wang Ruixiu, the secretary of the Party Branch, did not know how to run cooperatives last year, but directly participated in the work of running cooperatives this year. Through hard study and drilling in practical work, she is now familiar with cooperative business. In order to implement the policy of "the whole Party running cooperatives," the Party Branch committee studies mutual aid and cooperation work twice a month, and Party members study documents related to mutual aid and cooperation once a month. Now all eleven members of the township Party Branch committee have learned how to run cooperatives. Because Beitian Township's work of establishing cooperatives has been relatively fully prepared ideologically, in terms of leadership backbone, and organizationally, the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in cooperatives has gradually increased, and the work of expanding and establishing cooperatives has been done well. But this does not mean that this township has no shortcomings in the work of expanding and establishing cooperatives. There are still many shortcomings in the work. For example, the ideological concerns of the peasants on some specific issues have not been resolved thoroughly, and some people still neglect the reorganization of mutual aid teams. This requires continued hard work to improve.

    榆次县北田乡是怎样进行建社准备工作的
    震一　国峰
    今年八月下半月，山西榆次县北田乡的合作化运动有了进一步的发展：搭起了四个新社的架子，七个老社中有六个社共扩大了五十九户，全乡入社农户已由百分之四十上升到百分之五十九。
    也许有人要问：在短短的时间内既建立了新社，又扩大了老社，是不是北田乡的党支部在这方面有什么“速成法”？或者是采取了强迫命令的作法吧？都不是的。那末，他们是怎样建社和扩社的呢？简单说来，就是他们除了办好原有社以外，主要是进行了充分的建社准备工作。全乡计划
    北田乡去年办了杨梁、大伽南两个农业生产合作社。办得都好。杨梁社每亩产量比全乡每亩平均产量增产粮食十五斤，大伽南社每亩增产十二斤。这一增产事实使广大群众都要求入社。去年冬天中共北田乡支部根据群众的要求和本乡的具体条件，领导两个老社在原有的基础上扩大了户数；又在北田、张胡、田郊、小祁、南田五个空白村各建起一个新社；此外，还整顿了四十三个互助组。
    扩社建社以后，有十八个互助组又报名预约转社。党支部根据这一情况，采取自上而下提出指标，自下而上酝酿讨论的方法，订出了今年发展合作社的计划：入社农户不到百分之三十的北田、田郊、张胡三村再建四个新社；入社农户已达全村农户百分之八十以上的大伽南、杨梁、小祁三个老社，以集中力量巩固提高为主，在巩固的基础上求发展；其余四个老社每社发展十五户左右。十八个积极要求转社的互助组，为今年转社的培养对象组。这样，全乡建几个新社？建多大？哪个老社扩大？扩大多少？哪个互助组加入哪个社？哪几个互助组合并建一个社？都有了计划。这样，不但领导心中有数，群众心里也都有了个底子。以社带组
    去年冬天，北田乡农业生产合作社由两个发展成七个，四十多个互助组经过了整顿，这给全乡的合作化运动打下了良好基础。如何把已办起来的社巩固下来，使大量的互助组继续提高，就成为党支部领导方法中的一个新问题。党支部为适应这一新情况，对领导方法进行过多次研究，一致认为：必须运用互助合作网的形式来领导，采取以社带组的办法，来巩固和提高互助合作组织，培养转社对象组。于是建立了互助合作网，在党支部的领导下，每月召开两次会，除合作社社长参加外，还吸收了转社对象组组长参加。会上主要是交流工作经验，研究工作方法。党支部并确定以大伽南社为中心社，使它在各种工作中走前一步，创造经验，推广全面。此外，七个社和十八个准备转社的互助组还建立了定期的联系制度。各个社每月的一次政治课，这些组的组员也参加听讲。
    合作社除了从政治思想上帮助互助组以外，在生产技术上也经常指导互助组。今春抗旱保墒时，张胡村张四妮互助组不会使用木滚压地，大伽南庞全互助组不懂种棉技术，合作社便派出技术员去具体指导这两个组。在下种时，常改旺互助组的五十亩谷子，种了三次没捉住苗，节令已到夏至，组员们的种籽已经用尽，眼看有荒地的危险。张胡村合作社便借给种籽一百五十斤，保证适时下了种。张四妮互助组割麦锄苗的时候，组内发生了争工抢时的矛盾，这个村的合作社副社长陈成义便亲自到互助组帮助，让大家进行民主讨论，根据各种农活的缓急，排出作活的先后次序，问题得到解决。此外，合作社在每个生产活动中，都以自己的模范行动，带动互助组开展竞赛，这对生产推动作用很大。在互助合作网的推动下，采取了以社带组的方法，不但巩固了老社，密切了社组关系，而且提高和巩固了互助组。去冬确定的十八个转社对象组，经过春夏两季的努力，已有十五个组正式转社。全乡十七个临时互助组，都已提高为常年互助组，十一个常年互助组中，有五个组实行了计划生产和小包工。搞好生产
    领导互助组搞好生产，是做好转社准备工作的中心一环。所以党支部从今年春天以来，便加强了对互助组的生产领导。春耕生产开始，不少互助组认为今年春长，农活可以慢慢来，党支部便发动大家制定春耕生产计划，还帮助十八个准备转社的互助组制定了全年生产计划。接着，又通过互助合作网介绍了大伽南社进行土地基本建设的经验，组织各组到大伽南社进行了实地观摩。这就推动了各组的春耕生产。据十八个准备转社的互助组统计，今春共修边垒埝一千六百道、开渠十六条、起垫地二百亩。田郊村许永昌互助组在下种前刨荒土垫地每亩达一百多担。到“小满”节时，天旱不雨，合作社带动互助组开展了担水点种棉花工作。使全乡一千四百多亩的棉花播种任务顺利完成。一般互助组秋地只锄二次，准备转社的互助组和合作社锄到三次。由于合作社的带动，各组在经济上也逐渐发生了联系。准备转社的十八个互助组，集体经营了一百四十亩丰产地，合伙购置水桶十九担、步犁十三张、水车两辆、喷雾器九架、大车两辆。张胡村张甲保互助组的组员都乐意买一部双轮双铧犁，但经济力量不足，便同张四妮互助组商量联合购买，张四妮组很同意，都说：买吧！秋后咱们就是一家人了。两组在酝酿建社的过程中，生产劲头更大了。在生产中，互助组员的集体主义思想和建社的积极性提高了。培养骨干
    办好一个合作社，除了全体社员齐心努力外，具备一定的领导骨干是决定因素。北田乡党支部一年来十分注意培养骨干的问题。采取的方法是通过互助合作网，组织全体社干部和互助组骨干，在日常生产活动中学习办社。十八个转社对象组中，已经有四十九个培养成熟的骨干，其中有六人具备了入党条件。党支部委员首先学会了办社。党支部书记王瑞秀同志去年不会办社，今年直接参加了办社工作。由于在实际工作中苦学苦钻，现已熟悉了办社业务。为了贯彻“全党办社”的方针，党支委会每月研究两次互助合作工作，党员每月学习一次有关互助合作的文件。现在全乡十一个支部委员全部学会了办社。北田乡的建社工作由于在思想上、领导骨干上、组织上都进行了比较充分的准备，群众参加合作社的情绪逐步提高，扩社、建社工作做得很好。但这并不是说这个乡在扩社建社工作中就没有缺点了，工作中的缺点仍然是不少的。比如，农民对某些具体问题的思想顾虑解决得还不透，有些人还忽视对互助组的整顿等。这都需要继续进行艰苦的工作来加以改进。
