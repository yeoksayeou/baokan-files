Introduction to the Soviet Moscow "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble

    The Moscow "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble is the youngest outstanding female dance troupe in the Soviet Union. It was founded in 1948. Although it has only been around for seven years, it has achieved outstanding artistic success and has become an art group with a high reputation in the Soviet Union and Europe.
    In 1948, a performance of amateur art by collective farm members of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was held at the Moscow State Grand Theater. This performance focused on the rich and diverse Russian folk dances. The young men and women of the collective farms sincerely and enthusiastically performed many beautiful folk dances and ring dances, leaving a very deep impression on the Moscow audience. At this event, the idea of establishing a professional Russian women's dance troupe was born. At that time, the dance director Nadezhdina was entrusted to be responsible for organizing the work of this new dance troupe. The "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble was born in this way. Since then, Nadezhdina has served as the artistic leader of the troupe.
    Nadezhdina is an outstanding artistic activist. She received specialized dance training and worked as a ballet dancer at the Moscow Grand Theater for ten years. With great love, she carefully studied the folk dances of the Moscow Province, Kalinin Province, Molotov Province, and Gorky Province, as well as the rich folk dance heritage of various parts of Siberia, which gave her a wealth of material for her subsequent creations.
    Nadezhdina has superb professional skills, practical work experience, excellent discernment, and the rich imagination of a director. Therefore, she has achieved great success in her work with the young comrades of the dance troupe.
    Due to her outstanding creative achievements in art, Nadezhdina was awarded the honorary title of Honored Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and in 1950 she was awarded the Stalin Prize.
    The dances performed by the "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble, whether ancient and elegant ring dances or cheerful and lively dances from modern Soviet rural areas, strive to present the poetic image of Russian girls to the audience. The name of the dance troupe—"Beryozka" (Little Birch Tree)—was not given to it by the members of the dance troupe, but by the audience after seeing the dance troupe's first work, the Russian girls' ring dance "Beryozka." Because they loved this program, they used it to call the dance troupe. The birch tree growing in the Russian fields is one of the most beloved trees of the Soviet people, and it often appears in Russian folk songs, poems, and dances. In the ring dance "Beryozka," the girls hold tender green birch branches of spring and glide lightly across the stage; they sing songs, symbolizing the arrival of spring on the earth, and also symbolizing the arrival of spring in the hearts of the girls.
    The dance troupe's repertoire includes classical and modern beautiful dances. There is the "Ancient Russian Northern Ring Dance," which reflects the simple, calm, and serious style of the northern people, the "Collective Farm Polka," which expresses the happy and joyful life of the collective farm, the "Swan Dance," in which the dancers wear beautiful costumes, like a group of dignified swans floating leisurely in the blue waves, and the "Snowstorm Dance," danced in the midst of wind and snow, as well as the "Maiden Competition Dance," "Soviet Young Women's Dance," "Cossack Women's Dance," "Merry-Go-Round Dance," "Maiden Cadre Dance," and the slapstick dance "Double Carriage," all showing the girls' passionate youthful vitality. Among the newly added programs are the ancient Russian ring dance "Little Chain Dance" and the lyrical maiden dance performed in the film "Happy Life."
    The dance troupe has thirty-six female dancers, many of whom are graduates of the dance school attached to the Soviet Grand Theater, and the rest are amateur dancers. Among those cultivated in the dance troupe are: Lukyanova, Agafonova, Lyubova, Trenova, Romanova, and Fedyushina.
    The dance troupe's dance and music are organically linked, and the instrumental accompaniment uses folk instruments such as the accordion and balalaika. The accordion soloists are Ye. Kuznetsov, Galkin, Kornev, and Gen. Lvov. The balalaika soloists are Leonid and Vladimirov.
    After participating in the film "Happy Life," the dance troupe began to think that it was necessary to add chorus songs to some dances. The lead singers of the dance troupe's chorus are two young female singers, Brinnikova and Amerikina.
    The broad audiences in many provinces, cities, and republics of the Soviet Union have seen the wonderful performances of the "Beryozka" Dance Ensemble. It has been to Leningrad, Ukraine, the Baltic republics, the Caucasus, Murmansk, the Crimean Peninsula, South Sakhalin Island, and the Donbass.
    The dance troupe has made many foreign performance tours. It has been to Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Austria, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium, and England; it has also recently been to Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. They have been warmly welcomed by audiences everywhere.
    In 1949, the dance troupe won first prize and the title of laureate at the performance competition of the World Youth and Student Festival in Budapest.

    苏联莫斯科“小白桦树”舞蹈团介绍
    莫斯科“小白桦树”舞蹈团是苏联最年轻的优秀的女子舞蹈团。它成立于一九四八年，虽然只有七年的历史，但是由于它在艺术上获得了杰出的成就，已成为苏联和欧洲的一个享有极高声誉的艺术团体。
    一九四八年，在莫斯科国立大剧院举行了一次俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国集体农庄庄员的业余艺术观摩会演。这次会演集中表现了俄罗斯民间舞蹈的丰富多采。集体农庄的男女青年们真挚而热情地表演了许多优美的民间舞蹈和环舞，给莫斯科的观众们留下了极其深刻的印象。在这次会演上产生了要成立一个俄罗斯职业女子舞蹈团的想法。当时就委托舞蹈导演纳杰日金娜来负责组织这个新的舞蹈团的工作。“小白桦树”舞蹈团就是这样诞生的。从那时起，纳杰日金娜就担任该团的艺术领导人。
    纳杰日金娜是一位杰出的艺术活动家。她受过专门的舞蹈训练，在莫斯科大剧院担任过十年的舞剧演员。她怀着无比热爱的心情细心地研究了莫斯科省、加里宁省、莫洛托夫省和高尔基省的民间舞蹈和西伯利亚各地丰富的民间舞蹈遗产，这就使她在此后的创作上有了丰富的材料。
    纳杰日金娜有着高超的专业技巧、实际工作的经验、卓越的鉴别力和导演的丰富想像力。因此在她和舞蹈团的青年同志们共同的工作中获得了巨大的成就。
    由于她在艺术上的创造性的优异成就，纳杰日金娜获得了俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国功勋艺术家的崇高称号，一九五○年并荣获斯大林奖金。
    “小白桦树”舞蹈团所表演的舞蹈，不论是古老的优雅的环舞或现代苏联农村的愉快活泼的舞蹈，都力图在观众面前表现出俄罗斯少女富有诗趣的形象。舞蹈团的这个名称——“小白桦树”，不是舞蹈团的成员给它取上的，而是观众在看到舞蹈团的第一个作品——俄罗斯少女的环舞“小白桦树”以后，因为热爱这个节目，就用它来称呼这个舞蹈团。生长在俄罗斯原野上的白桦树是苏联人民最喜爱的树木之一，它常常出现在俄罗斯的民谣、诗歌和舞蹈之中。在环舞“小白桦树”中，少女们捧着春天的青嫩的白桦枝，轻盈地滑过舞台；她们唱着歌，象征着春天来到大地，也象征着春天来到了少女的心里。
    舞蹈团上演节目中包括有古典的和现代的优美舞蹈。有反映北方人民朴实、沉着和严肃风格的“古老的俄罗斯北方环舞”，有表现出集体农庄幸福和愉快生活的“集体农庄波尔卡舞”，有舞蹈家穿着优美的服装宛如一群庄严的天鹅在蓝色的波浪中怡然浮游的“天鹅舞”和在风雪交加中舞蹈的“风雪舞”，还有表现出少女热烈的青春活力的“少女竞演舞”、“苏维埃女青年舞”、“哥萨克女子舞”、“回转木马舞”、“少女加德利舞”和滑稽舞“双马车”。在新增加的节目中，有古代俄罗斯环舞“小链子舞”以及参加影片“幸福的生活”演出的少女抒情舞。
    舞蹈团拥有三十六位女舞蹈家，其中有很多是苏联大剧院附设舞蹈学校的毕业生，其余的都是业余舞蹈家。在舞蹈团中培养起来的有：卢基扬诺娃、阿加弗诺娃、略包娃、特雷诺娃、罗曼诺娃和费久希娜。
    舞蹈团的舞蹈和音乐是有机地联系在一起的，器乐伴奏使用民间乐器手风琴和三角琴。手风琴独奏者是叶·库兹涅佐夫、加尔金、柯尔涅夫和根·里沃夫。三角琴独奏者是列昂尼德、弗拉吉米罗夫。
    舞蹈团在参加影片“幸福的生活”演出后，开始想到在某些舞蹈中有配加合唱歌曲的必要。舞蹈团合唱领唱者是两位年青的女歌手布林尼科娃和阿美里基娜。
    苏联许多省市和共和国的广大观众都看到过“小白桦树”舞蹈团的精彩演出。它曾到过列宁格勒、乌克兰、波罗的海沿岸各共和国、高加索、摩尔曼斯克、克里米亚半岛、南库页岛和顿巴斯等地。
    舞蹈团不止一次地到国外作访问演出，它到过匈牙利、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、德意志民主共和国、芬兰、瑞典、挪威、奥地利、荷兰、瑞士、比利时和英国；最近还到过保加利亚和南斯拉夫。她们到处受到广大观众的热烈欢迎。
    一九四九年，舞蹈团在布达佩斯举行的世界青年与学生联欢节表演竞赛中荣获了一等奖和得奖者称号。
