    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, October 4th: According to a CTK report on October 3rd: The Government of the Czechoslovak Republic recently signed a trade agreement with the Government of the Egyptian Republic, according to which Czechoslovakia should supply Egypt with arms in exchange for cotton, rice, and other goods. After the signing of this agreement, there followed an intense campaign mainly aimed at pressuring the Egyptian government to cancel the agreement it concluded with Czechoslovakia.
    To this end, the Czechoslovak government deems it necessary to make the following statement:
    The Czechoslovak-Egyptian treaty was concluded on the basis of the inalienable right of sovereign states to conclude treaties that are in accordance with their legitimate interests and do not carry any conditions.
    The Czechoslovak government concluded this treaty within the scope of normal trade relations, and it also took note of the policy of national independence pursued by the Egyptian government and took into account Egypt's legitimate right to obtain the necessary materials to safeguard its national defense.
    The Czechoslovak government is absolutely opposed to any interference in the normal relations between sovereign states, and it will faithfully fulfill the obligations it has undertaken under the Czechoslovak-Egyptian treaty.
    Xinhua News Agency: Egyptian Minister of State Anwar al-Sadat published an article in "Al-Gomhuria" commenting on George Allen's sudden visit to Cairo, saying: "It seems that the West has begun to lose its common sense. The United States is threatening us, Britain is warning us, and all this is simply because we demand freedom. Allen came to Egypt to threaten us that if Egypt changes the current balance of power in the Middle East, the United States will stop providing us with assistance under the economic cooperation plan. The United States wants to act as a guardian in the Middle East and arrange the fate of the people in this region. Who gave it the right to do so? Does the United States still think it can achieve anything by using outdated intimidation and pressure policies?" Sadat said that Egypt is not afraid of any threats or intimidation, and "anyone who wants to establish control over it or wants to put it under its own influence will inevitably encounter its resolute opposition."
    Xinhua News Agency, October 4th: TASS Cairo, October 3rd: Many articles and letters recently published in Egyptian newspapers have expressed support for Nasser's government's policy of maintaining Egypt's independence and national interests.
    "Al-Gomhuria's" editorial wrote: "Every Egyptian welcomes Nasser's decision to purchase arms from Czechoslovakia because it did not impose any conditions on Egypt. Let the West, especially the United States, know that Nasser has the support of all the Egyptian people."
    The newspaper said that the Prime Minister is constantly receiving telegrams and resolutions from public organizations, trade unions, and individuals expressing support for the government.
    Egyptian Minister of State Sadat wrote in "Al-Gomhuria" when discussing the news that the United States is currently "expressing its willingness to sell arms to Egypt": "We are willing to buy American arms, but they must not be attached with conditions. We do not want to be satellites of the United States or Britain, and we do not want to take orders from London or Washington. No force can make us change our position and abandon the policy of safeguarding our complete independence."
    Xinhua News Agency: Cairo News: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs, George Allen, visited Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser on October 1st and held lengthy discussions with him on the issue of Egypt's purchase of arms.
    According to the Egyptian "Al-Ahram" correspondent in New York, citing news published in American newspapers, "The United States threatened Egypt with the cancellation of economic aid." The news said that Nasser made Allen wait for ninety minutes before receiving him. "The reason for this delay was Egypt's dissatisfaction with the news about the United States threatening to cancel economic aid."

    捷克斯洛伐克政府就捷埃贸易协定发表声明
    埃及报纸支持纳赛尔政府维护独立的政策
    新华社布拉格四日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社三日讯：捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府同埃及共和国政府最近签订了一项贸易协定，根据这项贸易协定捷克斯洛伐克应供给埃及军火以换取棉花、大米等货物。这项协定签订之后，接着就展开了一个主要是想用压力来迫使埃及政府取消它同捷克斯洛伐克缔结的协定的激烈的运动。
    为此，捷克斯洛伐克政府认为有必要作下列声明：
    捷克斯洛伐克—埃及条约是在主权国家具有不可剥夺的、签订符合于它们的正当的利益和不带有任何条件的条约的权力的基础上缔结的。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府是在正常的贸易关系的范围内缔结这一条约的，并且它也注意到埃及政府所实行的民族独立的政策和考虑到埃及有获得必要的物资来保障本国国防的合法权利。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府绝对反对对主权国家之间的正常关系作任何干涉，它将忠实履行根据捷克斯洛伐克—埃及条约而承担的义务。
    据新华社讯　埃及国务部长安·萨达特在“共和国报”上发表文章，评论乔治·艾伦突然访问开罗一事说：“看来好像西方已经开始丧失常识。美国在威胁我们，英国在警告我们，而这一切都只是因为我们要求自由。艾伦到埃及来，是为了要威胁我们说，如果埃及改变了中东目前的力量对比，美国就要停止根据经济合作计划给予我们的援助。美国要在中东以监护人自居，并且还要安排这个地区的人民的命运，到底谁给它这样做的权利呢？难道美国到现在还以为能够利用过时的威吓和压力政策来达到什么目的吗？”萨达特说，埃及不怕任何威胁和恐吓，“谁要想对它建立控制或者要想把它置于自己的势力之下，就必将遭到它的坚决反对。”
    新华社四日讯　塔斯社开罗三日讯：近来埃及报纸所刊载的许多文章和信件都表示支持纳赛尔政府的维护埃及的独立和民族利益的政策。
      “共和国报”的社论写道：“每一个埃及人都欢迎纳赛尔的从捷克斯洛伐克购买军火的决定，因为它没有向埃及提出任何条件。让西方，特别是让美国知道，纳赛尔得到全体埃及人民的支持。”
    这家报纸说，总理正在不断接到公众团体、工会和个别人士的表示支持政府的电报和决议。
    埃及国务部长萨达特在“共和国报”谈到关于美国目前正“表示愿意把军火卖给埃及”的消息时写道：“我们愿意购买美国军火，但是不得附有条件。我们不愿做美国或英国的卫星国，我们不愿听命于伦敦或华盛顿。没有任何力量能使我们改变我们的立场和放弃维护我们全部的独立的政策。”
    据新华社讯　开罗消息：美国负责近东、南亚和非洲事务的助理国务卿乔治·艾伦在十月一日访问了埃及总理纳赛尔，就埃及购买军火问题同他作了长时间的商谈。
    据埃及“金字塔报”驻纽约记者援引美国报纸刊载的消息说，“美国以取消经济援助威胁埃及”。消息说，纳赛尔曾经让艾伦等了九十分钟然后才接见他。“这种耽搁的理由是埃及对于关于美国要以取消经济援助为威胁的消息表示不满。”
