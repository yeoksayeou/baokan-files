Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 22nd (TASS): On October 21st, US Secretary of State Dulles departed for Europe to attend the Geneva conference of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. On his way to Geneva, Dulles will visit Rome, then hold unilateral talks with the British and French Foreign Ministers in Paris and attend a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council.

Before leaving Washington, Dulles issued a statement to the press saying: "The purpose of the Foreign Ministers' Conference I am going to attend is, as President Eisenhower said in July this year, to turn the general agreements reached at the Geneva summit meeting into concrete agreements." He said: "This requires genuine reconciliation and some concessions from both sides. The US delegation will act in this spirit."

He said that the United States "will seek the reunification of Germany within a European security system."

He also said that the United States "will seek to advance the disarmament issue being dealt with by the United Nations, and we are willing to promote contact between East and West, which will promote understanding, friendship, and the cause of peace."

Dulles concluded: "I recognize that this conference is of great significance. Its foundation was personally laid by the heads of government. If we cannot build on this foundation, then we will have to abandon many grand hopes. If, as I believe, we can build on this foundation, even if it is not much, it will be good for the whole world, and we can look forward to the future with new confidence."

    前往日内瓦参加四外长会议
    杜勒斯在启程前发表声明
    新华社二十三日讯　塔斯社华盛顿二十二日讯：十月二十一日，美国国务卿杜勒斯启程飞往欧洲参加美、英、苏、法四国外长日内瓦会议。赴日内瓦途中，杜勒斯将访问罗马，然后在巴黎同英法两国外长举行单方面会谈并且参加北大西洋公约组织理事会会议。
    杜勒斯在离开华盛顿前向报界发表声明说：“我前去参加的外长会议的目的，正如艾森豪威尔总统在今年七月所说，是要把日内瓦最高级会议取得的一般协议变为具体协议。”他说：“这是需要真正的和解，需要双方作出一些让步的。美国代表团将本着这种精神行事。”
    他说，美国“将设法寻求德国在一个欧洲安全体系内的重新统一”。
    他又说，美国“将设法推进联合国正在处理的裁军问题，我们愿意促进东方和西方间的接触，这种接触将会促进了解、友谊与和平事业。”
    杜勒斯最后说：“我认识到，这次会议是有重大的意义的。它的基础是由政府首脑们亲自奠定的。如果我们不能在这个基础上有所建树，那末就不得不放弃许多远大的希望。如果像我相信的那样，我们能在这个基础上有所建树，即使是建树不多，这对全世界也都是好的，我们就能够怀着新的信心瞻望未来。”
