Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 8th: According to TASS, the French National Assembly began debating the French government's policy on Morocco on the evening of the 6th. The debate began in a tense atmosphere following the resignation of four "Social Republican" ministers who disagreed with Prime Minister Faure's policy on Morocco. Prime Minister Faure delivered a speech defending the government's policy. Recalling the military measures already taken to suppress the Moroccan national liberation movement, he said that these measures were "in line with the policy of achieving stability by whatever means."

Faure emphasized "the importance of maintaining French influence" in Morocco, and added that this could only be achieved through a "gradual and reform policy." From his speech, it appears he believes these reforms should first include the establishment of a "Council of the Throne" to replace Sultan Arafa, and the formation of a "representative" Moroccan government composed of some nationalist leaders. Morocco's foreign policy and defense issues should remain under French jurisdiction.

As is known, Sultan Arafa has left French Morocco for Tangier, but the other measures planned by the Faure government have not yet been implemented because ministers who defend the interests of the most stubborn colonial groups oppose doing so.

Following Faure's speech, Socialist MP Chawari criticized the "policy of force" implemented in Morocco and the right-wing government leaders who obstruct the implementation of reforms.

    法议会辩论政府对摩洛哥政策
    新华社八日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国国民议会六日晚开始辩论法国政府对摩洛哥的政策。辩论是在不同意富尔的摩洛哥政策的四名“社会共和党”部长辞职以后产生的紧张气氛中开始的。富尔总理发表了一篇演说，为政府的政策辩护。他追述已经采取的镇压摩洛哥民族解放运动的军事措施时说：这些措施是“符合于不管用什么方法以实现安定为目的的政策的”。
    富尔强调指出在摩洛哥“维护法国的影响的重要性”，他又说，这只能通过“循序渐进和改革政策”来实现。从他发表的演说看来，他认为这些改革首先应该包括设立一个“王位委员会”来代替苏丹阿拉法，并且成立一个由某些民族主义领袖参加的“有代表性的”摩洛哥政府。摩洛哥的外交政策和国防的问题应该仍然属于法国的管辖范围。
    大家知道，苏丹阿拉法已经离开法属摩洛哥到丹吉尔，但是富尔政府所计划的其他措施还没有付诸实施，因为维护最顽固的殖民集团利益的部长们反对这样做。
    在富尔发言以后讲话的是社会党议员沙瓦里，他批评在摩洛哥执行的“武力政策”和阻挠实行改革的右翼政府领袖。
