To the editorial comrades, please forward this to all the workers of the Tractor Manufacturing Plant:

We were extremely happy to read in the newspaper that you have officially started construction of China's first tractor manufacturing plant!

We farmers are so eager to use machines for production! In the past, we lived a life of "bran and vegetables for half the year," without enough to eat or wear. After liberation, following the land reform and Chairman Mao's instructions to organize and develop production, our lives gradually improved. However, because we are still using backward production tools, the increase in production is very slow, which cannot meet the needs of national industrial construction and all the people. Therefore, we are constantly hoping that you can quickly build the factory so that we farmers can use tractors for production as soon as possible.

Comrades, we know that if we want to use machines for production as soon as possible, we must actively support the national socialist industrialization cause. Therefore, all of our cooperative members, men and women, are working hard to overcome all difficulties and actively labor to complete the production increase plan. We are also responding to the call of the state to sell as much grain and cotton as possible to the state. For example, last year – the first year after our cooperative expanded – we sold 170,000 jin of cotton to the state. This year, we overcame drought, pests, and floods, and achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. For example, wheat increased from 115 jin per mu last year to 168 jin per mu; cotton is estimated to yield more than 200 jin per mu, an average increase of 55 jin per mu compared to last year; and the late autumn crops are also growing very well. We will continue to work hard to ensure that we can sell 250,000 jin of cotton to the state this year (40,000 jin more than originally planned); use the money from selling cotton to first repay the state loan, and strive to save 30,000 yuan in the state bank for the entire cooperative.

As you build the factory, all of our members express our determination to you that we will apply more fertilizer, improve production technology, build water conservancy projects, and promote improved varieties in the future to ensure increased production every year and sell more grain and cotton to the state. We hope that you will use your wisdom and tap your potential in your work to build the factory as soon as possible.

All members of the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative, Gou Zhao Township, Zhengzhou Suburbs

### 让我们早日使用拖拉机生产  郑州市郊前进农业生产合作社社员写信祝贺建设拖拉机制造厂的职工

    让我们早日使用拖拉机生产 
    郑州市郊前进农业生产合作社社员写信祝贺建设拖拉机制造厂的职工编辑同志请转建设拖拉机制造厂的全体职工同志们：
    我们在报纸上看到了你们正式动工兴建我国第一个拖拉机制造厂的消息，感到无比的高兴！
    我们农民多么渴望使用机器生产啊！过去，我们一直着过“糠菜半年粮”，吃不饱，穿不暖的生活；解放后，经过土地改革，又遵照毛主席的指示走了组织起来发展生产的道路，我们的生活才逐渐得到了改善。但是，由于我们目前还使用着落后的生产工具，产量提高得很慢，这样就满足不了国家工业建设和全体人民的需要。所以，我们时刻盼望着你们能够迅速地把工厂建设好，让我们农民早日用拖拉机生产。
    同志们，我们知道，我们要想早日使用机器生产，就必须积极支持国家社会主义工业化的事业。因此，我们全社男女都努力克服一切困难，积极劳动，来完成增产计划；我们还响应国家号召，把粮食和棉花尽多地卖给国家，像去年——我们扩社后的第一年，就卖给国家十七万斤棉花。今年，我们战胜了旱灾、虫灾和水灾，获得了空前的丰收。例如小麦由去年的每亩一百十五斤提高到每亩一百六十八斤；棉花据估计每亩可以收获二百斤以上，比去年每亩平均增产五十五斤；晚秋作物也长得很好。我们还要继续努力，保证今年能够卖给国家二十五万斤棉花（比原计划多卖四万斤）；把卖棉花的钱首先用来归还国家贷款，同时全社争取在国家银行里储蓄三万元。
    在你们建厂的时候，我们全体社员向你们表示决心，今后要多施肥料，改进生产技术，兴修水利，推广良种，保证年年增产，把更多的粮食和棉花卖给国家。我们希望你们在工作中发挥智慧，挖掘潜力，早日把厂子建设好。
    郑州市郊沟赵乡前进农业生产合作社全体社员
