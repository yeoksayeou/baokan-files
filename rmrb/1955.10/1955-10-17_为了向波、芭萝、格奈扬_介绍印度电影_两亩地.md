    To Bo, Balo, Genayan…
    ——Introducing the Indian film "Two Acres of Land"
    Yuan Shuipai
    Original work by Sai Chaterjee, screenplay by H. Mukherjee, directed by B. Roy, translated and produced by Shanghai Film Studio
    The translation and dubbing of Indian films is something that Chinese audiences have long awaited. People hope that in addition to literature, fine arts, music, and dance, they can also see and further understand the lives of our friendly neighboring people on the screen. The holding of the Indian Republic Film Week has initially satisfied this demand and will surely be widely and warmly welcomed.
    Among the films screened this time, because "Two Acres of Land" is based on the life of farmers, and farmers in India, just like in China, are the largest part of the total population, it will naturally attract more of our attention. This internationally acclaimed film is indeed a masterpiece of Indian progressive film art. The screenwriter H. Mukherjee and director Bimal Roy, and other well-known Indian progressive artists, realistically and movingly depicted important aspects of Indian society, and expressed the Indian working people's desire for a happy life. Through this work, film artists full of a sense of justice sang a painful but confident song for the millions of farmers in India.
    The story of "Two Acres of Land" is not complicated. In order to build a factory, the landlord uses debt collection to rob the farmer Xiang Bo of his only two acres of land. In order to save this piece of land on which his family of four depends for survival, Xiang Bo bids farewell to his father and his wife Balo, and takes his son Genayan to the city to earn money to repay the debt. The father and son pull rickshaws and shine shoes, enduring all kinds of hardships, but still cannot earn enough to repay the debt. Balo comes to the city from the countryside to visit them, but is unfortunately injured by a car, and the savings are used to pay for medical expenses. When they return to their hometown, the two acres of land have been confiscated, and the father has gone mad.
    The original story is based on the poem of the same name by the great poet Tagore. The author is Sai Chaterjee, and the current screenplay is adapted by H. Mukherjee based on Chaterjee's original work. The long-standing tradition of humanism in Indian art, which was carried forward by Tagore, is clearly and excellently inherited here. Throughout the film is the humanistic spirit of the film artists, their deep sympathy for the unfortunate people. This spirit strongly infects the audience, making them have to suffer and rejoice with the development of the plot, and making them have to develop a love for the Indian working people.
    The film begins by showing us the dry land that has not rained for two years and the farmers under the attack of disaster. However, although the farmers are starving, the landlords and capitalists are becoming richer, and the exploitation and oppression of the farmers has not been relaxed at all. The scenes where Xiang Bo, a farmer who owes the landlord money, goes to the landlord's house to plead and repay the debt, and the capitalist and the landlord collude to oppress the farmers, prominently show the sharp opposition between them. On the one hand, it is the life-and-death struggle of the farmers, and on the other hand, it is the landlord lying on the couch leisurely eating grapes. The farmer kneels and pleads, but the landlord turns a blind eye and leaves. Only the exquisite clock on the wall of the landlord's house rings out a series of notes, like a cold and ruthless answer to the damaged and insulted person lying on the ground. On the one hand, the farmers are so happy that they sing and dance and go to the fields to cultivate because it has rained, and on the other hand, the capitalists immediately follow by taking a car to the countryside to forcibly occupy the land. The film uses a sharp contrast to show the brutality of the oppressors and also exposes the ugliness of the clerks who serve the landlords and some of the figures in the court.
    Completely different from the attitude towards such figures is the film's attitude towards the oppressed. The artists portray their kind and upright character with praise. Contrary to the lies fabricated by propagandists with ulterior motives about "inferior races" and "lower classes" being "barbaric," "cruel," and "bestial," here we see the beautiful qualities of the working people, their spirit of sympathy and mutual assistance, and their love.
    The image of the farmer Xiang Bo, created by the outstanding actor Balraj Sahni, leaves a very deep impression, and like the actress Nirupa Roy who plays Xiang Bo's wife Balo, convinces people that they truly embody the kind, honest, and loving character of Indian farmers.
    The repeated depictions of the love life between this farmer couple are very touching. For example, Xiang Bo collects the few remaining copper utensils in the house and goes to sell them to pay off the debt. Balo goes from initial dissatisfaction to finally taking off her earrings to give to her husband. This scene delicately portrays their inner feelings and shows the sweetness and bitterness and the sincerity of love in the love life of poor people. The author understands life very well.
        Xiang Bo: Balo… I…
        Balo: Go ahead and say it…
        Xiang Bo: How can I say it? I have never given you anything…
        Balo: Oh, you want these earrings that my father gave me? I know even if you don't say it.
        Xiang Bo: No, no, Balo, keep them, it will hurt your heart.
        Balo: Are you still afraid of hurting my heart?
        Xiang Bo: Do you think I am not hurting? I have no choice. If the land is preserved, there is still hope. Hmm! For example, some plots depicting Xiang Bo leaving home and parting with Balo, as well as Balo writing letters and waiting for letters, are all beautiful and moving.
    The love between this farmer couple and their child Genayan is also a key focus of the film. Genayan secretly goes to shine shoes to earn a few cents and brings them back, and spends part of it to buy bracelets for his mother. He is misunderstood by his father for spending the money he saved from pulling the rickshaw indiscriminately, so he slaps his son in the face. When Xiang Bo realizes his mistake, he hugs his son tightly, apologizes to him, and asks him to slap him back. ... Another time, in order to save money, Xiang Bo pretends to be uncomfortable and does not eat dinner, and gives the money to his son to let him eat alone. The child runs out of the door and turns back, also pretending to be uncomfortable and not wanting to eat. ... Another time, the child steals money to buy tonics and apples for his injured father. After Xiang Bo asks where the money came from, Xiang Bo endures the heartache and beats the child. The child says: "Hit me, hit me hard, as long as you eat a little, Dad!" ... The above and similar scenes fully express the relationship between this group of people and their noble hearts.
    The young actor Rattan Kumar, who plays Genayan, shows genius acting skills. The innocent and lovely image of the Indian child he created is unforgettable. Our voice actors also used appropriate tones to truly express the thoughts and feelings of the characters. When Genayan is repeatedly worried about his parents' tragic experiences, anxiously calling Dad or Mom, when he reads his mother's letter and cannot restrain his emotions when he reads the sentence that she misses him, the audience cannot help but shed tears for such a young child.
    The film not only portrays the characters of several main characters very realistically and deeply, but also portrays some minor characters vividly and prominently. The author shows the personality and typicality of the characters through the description of contradictions and struggles in real life. Taking a few children as an example, Genayan is a child who has not been contaminated by many evils in the city in the past. The film repeatedly expresses his aversion to stealing and fully portrays his pure and kind character. The thief who instigated Genayan to steal is certainly the worst, but he also has another side of his character. He sympathizes with Genayan and does not ask Genayan to sell the stolen goods, fearing that his inexperience will cause problems. He is willing to go himself. There is also Lelu, the shoe-shining child. Although he is not a bad child, the film describes that he has been deeply damaged by the environment. He initially ridicules and teases Genayan, who has just come from the countryside. He wants Genayan to call him "Grandpa," and he loves to imitate the life promoted in bad movies. But despite this, he still retains the qualities of the working people. Although he does not have a warm attitude on the surface, he actually takes care of Genayan's difficulties in learning to shine shoes, and enthusiastically encourages his companions to help Genayan. These personality traits are in line with the reality of life. The working people are kind and upright, and their class essence is absolutely different from the class essence of the oppressors and exploiters. The working people are the damaged. This artistic portrayal clearly expresses the author's love and sympathy for the masses of people. The author emphasizes the love and unity of the poor people in the city in the film, and their mutual support in times of trouble. Although the huge city with tall buildings and bridges makes a pair of farmer father and son from the countryside feel terrified, they find friendship and assistance in the lower levels of the city.
    Of course, the film also has some aspects that are not completely satisfactory. The Xiang Bo created by the author is a relatively passive farmer with a relatively narrow spiritual world, and his fate seems to be isolated; the final ending of the story is that this farmer who has lost his land leads his wife and children towards the vast horizon. But these shortcomings cannot erase the excellent achievements of "Two Acres of Land." This is a glorious milestone in India's realistic national film industry. We know that Indian film workers are advancing on an uneven road. They must resist the competition from Hollywood and other films with bad tendencies, and they must overcome many difficulties in creating their own national progressive films. In this film by Bimal Roy, we rarely see the influence of bad tendencies from foreign films. On the contrary, we see a strong national color, such as national music, songs and dances, and national styles in performance. The beautiful music closely matches the plot and blends with the character performances, giving people a high degree of aesthetic enjoyment, which is worth mentioning in particular.
    It should also be pointed out that the Mandarin translation of the dialogue in this film is quite successful, and the language used is the language of the masses, which is suitable for expressing Indian farmers. Our dubbing and reproduction work has been successful. Chinese film artists are using their work to strengthen Sino-Indian friendship, which is worthy of everyone's gratitude. Even more worthy of gratitude are the outstanding Indian film artists, who have made valuable contributions to the progressive film industry of their motherland, to Xiang Bo, Balo, Genayan..., to the happy future of the Indian people and the cause of world peace. Chinese audiences bless you! (Picture attached)

    为了向波、芭萝、格奈扬……
    ——介绍印度电影“两亩地”
  　袁水拍
    原著赛·查特赫莱　编剧　赫·穆凯尔吉　导演　比·罗伊　上海电影制片厂译制
    印度电影的翻译复制是我国观众久已盼望的事。人们盼望在文学、美术、音乐、舞蹈等以外，还能够从银幕上看到并进一步了解我们的友邦人民的生活。印度共和国电影周的举行，初步地满足了这个要求，是一定会受到广泛的热烈的欢迎的。
    这次放映的几部影片中，因为“两亩地”取材于农民生活，而农民在印度正如同在中国一样，是全部人口中最大的部分，自然更会引起我们的注意。这部享有国际声誉的影片，的确是印度进步电影艺术中的杰作。编剧赫·穆凯尔吉和导演比马尔·罗伊等印度著名进步艺术家真实地动人地描绘了印度社会的重要方面，表现了印度劳动人民对幸福生活的愿望。富于正义感的电影艺术家们，通过这部作品，为印度千百万农民唱出了一首悲痛的然而有信心的歌。
    “两亩地”的故事并不复杂。地主为了盖工厂，用逼债的方法，来抢劫农民向波仅有的两亩地。向波为了要保全这片一家四口赖以生存的土地，告别了他的父亲和他的妻子芭萝，带了儿子格奈扬到城市里去挣钱以便还债。父子二人一个拉人力车，一个擦皮鞋，吃尽千辛万苦，还是挣不满偿还那笔债款的数目。芭萝从乡下进城来探望他们，不幸被汽车撞伤，积下的钱付了医药费。当他们回乡时，两亩地已经被没收，父亲已经发了疯。
    故事原著的依据是伟大的诗人泰戈尔的同名的诗篇，作者为赛·查特赫莱，现在的电影剧本就是赫·穆凯尔吉根据查特赫莱的原著改编的。由泰戈尔所发扬光大起来的印度艺术的人道主义悠久传统，明显地在这里有着卓越的承继。贯穿着整个影片的，是电影艺术家们的人道主义精神，他们对不幸的人们的深厚同情。这种精神强烈地感染了观众，使观众不得不随着剧情的展开而痛苦而喜悦，使观众不得不对印度劳动人民发生热爱。
    影片一开始就使我们看到已经有两年没有下过雨的干旱的土地和灾难袭击下的农民。可是尽管农民在饥饿，地主、资本家却更加富有，对农民的剥削和压迫丝毫也没有放松。欠了地主债的农民向波到地主家去求情和还债以及资本家和地主合谋压迫农民的几场戏，突出地表现了他们之间的尖锐的对立。一方面是农民的生死存亡的挣扎，一方面是地主躺在榻上悠闲地吃葡萄。农民下跪泣求，地主掉头不顾而去，只有地主家壁上的精巧的挂钟叮当敲出一串乐音，像是对这匍伏在地上的被损害被侮辱者所作的一个冷酷无情的回答。一方面农民刚刚因为下了雨而高兴得唱歌跳舞，下地耕作，一方面紧跟着的是资本家坐着汽车下乡强占土地。影片采用了鲜明的对比的手法表现了压迫者的残暴，也暴露了那些替地主效劳的账房和法庭上的一些人物的丑态。
    和对待这类人物截然不同的是影片对被压迫者的态度，艺术家们满怀着赞扬之心，突出地刻划了他们的善良正直的性格。和别有用心的宣传家们所捏造的“劣等民族”“下流社会”怎样“野蛮”“残酷”“兽性”的谎言完全相反，在这里我们看到了劳动人民的优美的品质，他们的同情互助的精神和他们的爱情。
    杰出的演员巴拉吉·萨尼所创造的农民向波的形象，给人以极深刻的印象，和女演员尼鲁帕·洛埃所扮演的向波的妻子芭萝一样，使人确信他们真实地体现了印度农民的善良、诚实、慈爱的性格。
    一再描写的这对农民夫妇之间的爱情生活，是很动人的。例如：向波搜罗了家中仅剩的一些铜器食具，去变卖抵债，芭萝从最初的不满到最后脱下耳环来送给丈夫，这场戏细致地刻划了他们的心曲，表现了贫苦人们的爱情生活中的甘辛和爱情的真挚。作者是十分懂得生活的。
        向波：芭萝……我……
        芭萝：得……你就尽管说吧……
        向波：叫我怎么说呐？我是从来没给你添过什么……
        芭萝：噢，你是想要我爹给我的这付环子？你不说我也知道。
        向波：不，不，芭萝，你留着，这会伤你的心的。
        芭萝：你还怕我伤心吗？
        向波：你当我不伤心吗？我是没法子。地要保住了，总还有指望。嗯！又如向波离家同芭萝分别以及芭萝写信、盼信等表现他们的爱情的一些情节，都是美妙动人的。
    这对农民夫妇和他们的孩子格奈扬之间的亲子之爱也是影片所着重描写的。格奈扬瞒着父亲去擦皮鞋挣了几毛钱拿回来，并花了一部分去给母亲买镯子，被父亲误会是乱花了他拉车积下的钱，就打儿子的嘴巴。当向波知道自己弄错的时候，他紧紧地搂住儿子，向他认错，并要他打还嘴巴。……又一回，向波为了省钱，推说身子不舒服不吃晚饭，把钱给儿子，让他独自去吃。孩子跑出了门又回头，也推说不舒服不想吃。……又一回，孩子偷了钱给受伤的父亲买了补药和苹果，被向波问出了钱的来历后，向波忍着心疼打孩子，孩子说：“你打吧，使劲地打吧，只要你肯吃一点，爸爸！”……以上的以及类似的一些场面充分地表现了这一群人中间的关系和他们的高尚的心灵。
    演格奈扬的少年演员拉丹·库马尔表现了天才的演技。他所创造的天真可爱的印度儿童的形象是难以忘却的。我们的配音演员也用适当的语气真切地表达了角色的思想感情。当格奈扬一再地为父母的悲痛遭遇而忧虑，焦急地叫着爸爸或是妈妈的时候，当他念着妈妈的来信，念到她惦记自己的一句而不能抑制自己的感情的时候，观众是不能不为这样的幼小者掉下眼泪来的。
    影片不仅是对几个主要人物的性格的描写很真实和深刻，就是对一些次要人物的刻划，也是鲜明突出的。作者通过对现实生活中的矛盾和斗争的描写，显示出人物的个性和典型性来。就拿几个儿童来说，格奈扬是过去没有玷染过城市中许多罪恶的孩子，影片一再地表现了他对于偷窃行为的反感态度，充分刻划了他的纯洁善良的性格。那个唆使格奈扬偷窃的小偷当然是最坏的了，但他也有性格的另一侧面，他同情格奈扬，不叫格奈扬去销赃，怕不老练出毛病，他愿意自己去。还有勒路，那个擦鞋小孩，他虽则不是坏孩子，但是影片描写了他已经较深地受到环境的损害，他最初对格奈扬这刚从农村来的孩子是讥嘲作弄的，他要格奈扬叫他“大爷”，他爱模仿坏电影中所宣扬的生活。但尽管如此，他依旧保留着劳苦人民的品质。他虽则表面上没有温情的态度，可是实际上却照顾格奈扬初学擦皮鞋的困难，并且急公好义地鼓动同伴一起来帮助格奈扬。这些个性的塑造，是符合生活真实的，劳动人民是善良正直的，他们的阶级本质与压迫者剥削者的阶级本质是绝对不同的。劳动人民是被损害者。这种艺术的刻划清楚地表现了作者对人民群众的热爱和同情。作者在影片中强调了城市贫苦人民的友爱和团结，他们在患难中的互相扶持。有着高楼大桥的巨大城市虽则是那样地使一对乡下来的农民父子感到恐惧，但在城市的低层里，他们找到了友谊和援助。
    当然影片也还有使人不完全满足的地方，作者所塑造的向波是一个比较消极、精神世界比较狭小的农民，他的命运似乎是孤立的；故事最后的结局是这个失了土地的农民带着妻子和孩子走向茫然的天边。但这些缺点并不能抹掉“两亩地”的优异的成绩。这是印度的现实主义的民族的电影事业上的一块光辉的里程碑。我们知道，印度电影工作者是在不平坦的道路上前进的，他们必须抵抗着好莱坞的和其他不良倾向的影片的竞争，他们创造自己民族的进步的影片必须克服很多困难。在比马尔·罗伊的这部影片中我们绝少看到有外来影片的不良倾向的影响。相反地，我们看到了浓厚的民族的色彩，如民族的音乐、歌曲和舞蹈以及表演方面的民族风格等。优美的音乐紧紧地配合着剧情，和人物表演打成一片，给人以高度的美的享受，这是值得特别提出的。
    还应该提出的是，本片对白的华语翻译相当成功，所采用的语言是群众化的语言，用来表现印度农民，是相称的。我们的配音复制工作是有成绩的。中国的电影艺术家们用自己的工作来加强中印友谊，这是值得大家感谢的。更值得感谢的是印度的优秀的电影艺术家们，他们为了祖国的进步电影事业，为了向波、芭萝、格奈扬……为了印度人民的幸福前途和世界和平事业，作了可贵的贡献。中国观众祝福你们！（附图片）
