    在访问期间，代表团同苏联有关当局接洽和会谈后，已经就苏联帮助在孟买建立工艺研究所一事达成了协议。
    代表团先后在苏联逗留了近一个月，已经在十二日离开苏联。
    新华社新德里电　据“印度斯坦时报”报道，即将在苏联帮助下建造起来的比莱钢铁厂的建厂准备工作正在钢铁厂所在地进行中。为不久将到达印度的苏联专家建造的住宅已经接近完成。现在正在改善建筑工地的水电供应工作。一条从比莱到杜里—拉杰哈拉的六十英里长的铁路线已经开始修建，以便把铁矿运到钢铁厂。其他的建筑铁路的工作也在进行，其中包括修建一条联接在比莱、罗克拉和塔坦纳加的各个钢铁厂的铁路。
    新近完成的这个钢铁厂的蓝图所规定的生产能力比以前所设计的稍微大一点。这个蓝图将提交印度钢铁部批准。
