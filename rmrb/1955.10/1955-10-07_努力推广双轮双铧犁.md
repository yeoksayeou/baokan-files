    Strive to Promote the Double-Wheel Two-Way Plow
    According to the requirements of the national plan, 400,000 double-wheel two-way plows and double-wheel one-way plows should be sold this year. However, only 82,700 units were sold in the first half of the year, accounting for 20.6 percent of the annual sales plan. The sales plan for the first half of the year was not well completed, resulting in two consequences: on the one hand, the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations in various places could not meet the demand for double-wheel two-way plows; on the other hand, a large number of new plows manufactured by the state were stockpiled. Now, various places are preparing for autumn plowing and winter plowing, which is the peak season for promoting new-style animal-powered farm tools. Supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural departments in various places, especially the relevant departments in some provinces where the sales plan for the first half of the year was poorly completed, must seize this favorable opportunity and strive to achieve the plan for promoting double-wheel two-way plows and double-wheel one-way plows, so that these new-style animal-powered farm tools can be put into autumn and winter plowing as soon as possible, laying the foundation for promoting more new plows next year and the year after.
    It has long been proven by many facts that using double-wheel two-way plows and double-wheel one-way plows for plowing saves labor, produces more work, and deepens the soil to increase production. However, many farmers, including some cadres of agricultural cooperatives, still have some ideological concerns about purchasing this new plow. Their biggest concern is that they are afraid that they will not know how to use it or will not be able to use it well, and that they will not be able to repair the parts if they are broken or will not be able to find replacement parts. This is the result of the units selling farm tools only being responsible for selling finished products and neglecting technical guidance and parts supply. Fuyang County, Anhui Province, "promoted" 177 double-wheel two-way plows, but only 30 percent of them were used by farmers. This spring, the supply and marketing cooperative promoted 20 units in three townships in Wenji District of the county, but only one agricultural cooperative used one new plow to plow more than three mu of land, and the remaining 19 units were idle in the farmers' homes because the farmers did not know how to use them. This kind of forced promotion of new plows not only fails to achieve the goal of deep plowing and increased production, but also causes opposition from farmers, creating greater difficulties for future promotion of new farm tools.
    It is also wrong for some supply and marketing cooperative staff to lack the determination to learn the technology of using new-style farm tools and to not have the courage to help farmers dispel their ideological concerns, and to take a passive and inactive attitude towards this significant task. The Huaiyin County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiangsu Province allocated double-wheel two-way plows to the grassroots cooperatives in the Sanshu District according to the plan, but the staff of the grassroots cooperatives refused to accept them on the grounds that there was no place to put them; this grassroots cooperative did not promote a single new plow during the spring plowing this year.
    The staff of the supply and marketing cooperative must realize that the new-style farm tools operated by the supply and marketing cooperative are tools that farmers have not used before and that require certain skills to master. In order to smoothly promote this tool, it is necessary to overcome various conservative ideas and material constraints. Therefore, managing this kind of commodity requires complex organizational work, such as conducting demonstration education for farmers, imparting usage techniques, and solving problems such as installation, repair, and replacement of parts. Before our country can mass-produce tractors, the improvement of agricultural technology mainly relies on new-style animal-powered farm tools. Whoever does an excellent job in promoting and selling new-style animal-powered farm tools will make a beneficial contribution to agricultural production.
    Promoting new-style animal-powered farm tools must, of course, implement the principle of "technology first, supply second." However, relying solely on the strength of the supply and marketing cooperative cannot completely do a good job in imparting technology; agricultural technology promotion stations at all levels must take on this task. Before this year's autumn harvest, more than 200,000 farm tool operators who use new-style animal-powered farm tools have been trained from farmers across the country. This is a huge and powerful force for promoting new-style farm tools and reforming agricultural technology. They have already played a considerable role in this year's agricultural production. In order to meet the needs of this year's large-scale promotion of new farm tools, various places are also preparing to train hundreds of thousands of new farm tool operators this year. Technology promotion stations in various places should actively participate in the work of training new farm tool operators, and should also establish close ties with existing farm tool operators, answer the questions they raise, and improve their skills, so that they can become workers who impart the technology of using new-style farm tools without being separated from production, and play a greater role among the masses of farmers.
    Some farmers are unwilling to purchase new-style farm tools because some farm tools are not made strong enough. All manufacturing departments of new-style farm tools must strictly abide by the signed agreements, continuously reduce costs, and improve product quality. In the first half of this year, some production units did not deliver goods on time according to the plan, and some of the finished products that have been delivered are of too low quality and have large assembly errors. These shortcomings have caused great difficulties in promoting new-style farm tools and must be overcome with effort. In order to eliminate the phenomenon of shoddy manufacturing, it is necessary to strictly implement the product factory inspection system and resolutely pick out unqualified products. In the future, the repair of new-style farm tools will be the responsibility of the handicraft production department. Handicraft cooperatives and handicraft groups in various places must ensure the timely repair of new-style farm tools, which is an important aspect of cooperating with the promotion of new-style farm tools.
    The sales volume in the first half of the year was too small, and there is a large backlog of tasks in the fourth quarter. However, there are also favorable conditions for completing the task at present. This year, all parts of the country are celebrating a bumper harvest, the agricultural cooperation movement is booming, and in order to support the agricultural cooperation movement and promote agricultural technology transformation, the state has also adopted the method of financial subsidies to reduce the price of double-wheel two-way plows and double-wheel one-way plows by 40 percent. These are all favorable conditions for completing and overfulfilling the sales task. Shanxi, Henan and other provinces have made full use of these favorable conditions, not only will they complete this year's sales plan, but also have timely added sales figures to meet the needs of farmers. All industrial, handicraft, agricultural, supply and marketing, banking, transportation and other departments related to the promotion of new-style farm tools should adopt a positive attitude, conscientiously implement the plan, and ensure the timely completion of their tasks.
    The promotion of double-wheel two-way plows involves production, sales, transportation and other departments, and with the time being tight, it is even more necessary for various departments to accurately divide and cooperate. Therefore, party organizations in various places should strengthen leadership, organize the forces of various departments, and strive to fully complete and over fulfill the annual sales task of double-wheel two-way plows.

### 努力推广双轮双铧犁

    努力推广双轮双铧犁
    根据国家计划的要求，本年度应该推销双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁四十万部。但今年上半年仅仅推销了八万二千七百多部，占全年推销计划的百分之二十点六。上半年推销计划完成的不够好，造成两种结果：一方面，各地农业互助合作组织对双轮双铧犁的要求得不到满足；另一方面，国家制造的大量新犁被积压下来。现在各地正在准备秋耕、冬耕，正是推销新式畜力农具的旺季。各地供销合作社和农业部门，特别是上半年推销计划完成较差的若干省份的有关部门，必须抓紧这一有利时机，努力实现推销双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁的计划，使这些新式畜力农具早日投入秋耕、冬耕，为明年和后年推广更多的新犁打下基础。
    使用双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁耕地，省工出活、深耕增产，这早被许多事实所证明了。但是，有不少农民，包括一些农业合作社的干部，对于购买这种新犁还有一些思想顾虑。他们最大的顾虑是害怕买了来不会用或用不好，害怕零件坏了不能修理和无处补配。这是推销农具的单位只管推销成品，忽视技术指导和零件供应工作的结果。安徽省阜阳县“推广”了一百七十七部双轮双铧犁，农民使用的仅占百分之三十。今年春天，供销社在该县闻集区的三个乡推广了二十部，只有一个农业合作社用一部新犁耕了三亩多地，其余的十九部因为农民不会使用，还在农民家里闲放着。这种勉强推销新犁的作法，不但不能达到深耕增产的目的，而且会引起农民的反对，给今后推销新农具的工作造成更大的困难。
    某些供销社的工作人员缺乏学会新式农具使用技术的决心，没有帮助农民解除思想顾虑的勇气，对于这个意义重大的任务，采取消极怠工的态度，这同样是错误的。江苏淮阴县供销社按照计划把双轮双铧犁调拨到该县三树区基层社，基层社的工作人员竟借口没处放而不肯接受；这个基层社在今年春耕期间一部新犁都没有推广出去。
    供销社的工作人员都要认识，供销社经营的新式农具，是农民没有使用过的、需要一定技术才能掌握的工具。为了顺利地推广这种工具，必须克服各种保守思想的阻挠和物质条件的限制。因此，经营这种商品，就必须进行复杂的组织工作，例如，对农民进行示范教育，传授使用技术，解决安装、修理以及补配零件等问题。在我国还不能大量生产拖拉机以前，改良农业技术主要依靠新式畜力农具，谁在推广、销售新式畜力农具方面做了出色的工作，谁就对农业生产作了有益的贡献。
    推广新式畜力农具，固然必须实行“技术在先，供应在后”的原则。但是，仅靠供销社的力量，绝不能完全作好技术传授工作；各级农业技术推广站一定要把这个任务担负起来。截至今年秋收以前，全国各地已从农民中训练了二十多万名使用新式畜力农具的农具手。这是一支庞大有力的推广新式农具和改革农业技术的力量。他们已在今年的农业生产中发挥了相当的作用。为了适应今年大规模推广新农具的需要，今年各地还准备再训练几十万名农具手。各地技术推广站要积极参加训练新的农具手的工作，并且要同已有的农具手建立密切的联系，解答他们提出的问题，提高他们的技术，使他们成为不脱离生产的传授新式农具使用技术的工作人员，在农民群众中发挥更大的作用。
    有些农民所以不愿意购买新式农具，还因为某些农具制作得不够坚牢。所有新式农具的制造部门，必须严格遵守签订的协议，不断降低成本，提高产品质量。今年上半年，有些生产单位不按照计划及时交货，已经交出的成品，也有的质量太低，装配误差很大，这些缺点都给推销新式农具的工作造成很大的困难，必须努力加以克服。为了杜绝粗制滥造的现象，必须严格执行产品出厂检验制度，把不合格的产品坚决挑剔出来。今后新式农具的修理将由手工业生产部门负责，各地的手工业合作社、手工业小组要保证及时修理新式农具，这就是在一个重要方面配合了新式农具的推销工作。
    上半年推销数量太少，第四季度遗留任务很大。但是，当前也存在着完成任务的有利条件。今年全国各地喜庆丰收，农业合作化运动正在蓬勃开展，国家为了支持农业合作化运动和促进农业技术改造，又采用财政补贴的办法，把双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁的价格降低了百分之四十。这些都是完成和超额完成推销任务的有利条件，山西、河南等省充分运用这些有利条件，不仅将要完成今年的推销计划，而且适应农民的要求，及时追加了推销数字。一切和推广新式农具有关的工业、手工业、农业、供销、银行、运输等部门，都应该采取积极的态度，认真执行计划，保证按时完成自己的任务。
    双轮双铧犁的推广工作，涉及生产、推销、运输等部门，加以时间紧迫，更需要各部门精确地分工合作。因此，各地党的组织应该加强领导，把各部门的力量组织起来，争取全部完成和超额完成本年度双轮双铧犁的推销任务。
