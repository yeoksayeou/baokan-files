    From the Development of Chinese Porcelain to the "National Ceramics Exhibition"
    Chen Wanli
    Porcelain is one of China's great inventions. An important stage in its development was the firing of the porcelain body, transforming it from an opaque to a translucent material. This was achieved through the wisdom and creativity of countless laborers and long periods of arduous and diligent work. However, simply firing a plain porcelain, with only a white glossy surface, could not meet the demands of the people. Thus, colored glazes were invented, with blue glaze being the first.
    Glaze is a type of silicate. Applying glaze to the bisque (the shaped body) and firing it creates a glossy surface that is easy to clean and resistant to dirt or grime. If certain metallic oxides are added to the glaze, firing will result in a specific inherent color. This is how colored glazes are produced. For example, a glaze with iron oxide will appear yellow when fired in an oxidizing atmosphere and blue when fired in a reducing atmosphere, creating a blue glaze. From the late Eastern Han Dynasty to the Six Dynasties period, blue glaze was widely used on semi-porcelain objects, but the technology was not yet fully mastered. It wasn't until the Ru ware of the Northern Song Dynasty and the Longquan kilns of the Southern Song Dynasty that it reached its perfected form. This jade-like, sea-like colored glaze has always been admired and loved by porcelain enthusiasts worldwide. It represents the first extremely important discovery in the history of Chinese porcelain development. Following the firing of blue-glazed porcelain, red glaze was created using copper oxide. This glaze was first seen in the purple-red splashes on Jun ware, resembling a radiant red glow emerging in the vast blue sky. After continuous experimentation during the late Southern Song Dynasty and the Yuan Dynasty, it became the so-called "fresh red" and "gem red" of the Yongle and Xuande periods of the Ming Dynasty. During the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, imitations of this colored glaze led to various names such as Lang kiln red and peach bloom red. The creation of this red glaze, from the late Southern Song Dynasty to the early Qing Dynasty, experienced periods of loss and revival several times, mainly due to the proper control of copper oxide content and the reduction firing process. However, this dazzling glaze color remains one of the most brilliant inventions in the history of Chinese porcelain development. Simultaneously with the discovery of red glaze, underglaze blue was also invented. This involved using cobalt oxide to create a pigment for painting on the unfired bisque, covering it with white glaze, and then firing it in a kiln. The result was a serene and elegant blue painting on the clean, glossy porcelain. This marked the beginning of painted decoration. Moreover, this discovery of underglaze decoration greatly promoted the development of overglaze decoration.
    Furthermore, due to the relatively high level of feudal economy during the Song Dynasty, the organization of handicraft production had a very fine division of labor, and the technology was more advanced than in the Tang Dynasty. Therefore, ceramic craftsmanship in various regions was very developed. In addition to blue glaze, red glaze and underglaze blue were also nurtured and developed during those centuries. Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places all vigorously created many new methods for firing ceramics, each with strong local characteristics and unique styles.
    Chinese ceramic craftsmanship has gained international renown through thousands of years of continuous creation and development. However, in the last hundred years, due to external factors such as imperialist aggression and internal factors such as the reactionary rule of the Qing government, warlords, and the Kuomintang, the domestic ceramic industry has suffered under the dual pressure of exorbitant taxes and the dumping of foreign porcelain. This led to a decline in product quality, and many techniques were lost. At the same time, in order to cater to the tastes of bureaucrats, landlords, and the emerging comprador class, the shapes, colored glazes, and decorative patterns became vulgar, grotesque, and unsightly. Jingdezhen, which had always been famous throughout the country for its porcelain industry, was also riddled with problems and on the verge of collapse.
    Since liberation, thanks to the great care and attention of the Party and the People's Government, the face of the ceramic industry in various regions has gradually changed. Even in remote areas, production has increased to meet the needs of the broad masses of people. This is a crucial turning point for the revival of China's ceramic industry. In this context, the currently held "National Ceramics Exhibition" is of course of great significance.
    Taking Jingdezhen's products as an example, the exhibition reveals several commendable achievements in technology:
    Firstly, the successful firing of red glaze and the scientific recording of its components and content through chemical analysis. We should applaud and congratulate the veteran artists of Jingdezhen on this great accomplishment. In the future, further research is needed on how to grasp and control reduction firing, meaning that we must rely on science for production instead of relying solely on experience to determine the firing temperature.
    Secondly, the raven's wing black glaze, which had been lost for a long time, has also been successfully fired. It is said that the veteran artists of Jingdezhen are willing to contribute their experience gained through years of hard work and collectively research and create. As a result, other lost glazes such as eel skin yellow and tea dust glaze have also been fired quite well.
    Thirdly, great achievements have also been made in the firing of underglaze blue. However, it is said that the proportion of zhūmíng liào (a kind of cobalt material) used is not standardized, resulting in variations in the shade of blue. This is not a significant problem, as the color of blue can be traced back to the standards of the Kangxi era.
    Fourthly, there have been considerable achievements in the production of new varieties in the past year, such as sculpted porcelain figures. Statues of many heroic model figures and historical figures have replaced the old, unhealthy porcelain sculptures of the past.
    The exhibition also includes selected products from various regions. Although not comprehensive, it provides a general overview of the new look of the national ceramic industry since liberation, and many of them are excellent products. For example, the daily-use porcelain from Raoping, Guangdong, features painted flowers, birds, and fish that are relatively simple and not complicated, relatively elegant and not gaudy. The porcelain body is relatively thin and delicate, and the glaze is relatively fine and smooth. At the same time, the one-time firing of underglaze decoration saves materials, manpower, and reduces costs, meeting the requirements of practicality, economy, and aesthetics. These exhibits can provide encouragement and inspiration to ceramic craftsmanship in various regions. Among the pottery from Shiwan, Foshan, Guangdong, there are also many new varieties, and the bright and clear degree of the blue glazed wares is unprecedented since the Tang Sancai. The white-glazed black-decorated products from Fengfeng, Hebei, are also very prominent in this exhibition. There are four imitations of Song Dynasty works in the exhibits. Although they are imitations, they still demonstrate the preservation of the excellent techniques of the Song Dynasty. The pottery from Jieshou, Anhui, has bright colors; the daily-use nesting bowls from Zibo, Shandong, although only decorated with red and green flowers, have extremely bright colors; these are also worth mentioning. Unfortunately, the black glaze from Shanxi, the diverse pottery from the distilleries in Rongchang, Sichuan, and the daily-use porcelain from Dehua, Fujian, did not have time to participate in the exhibition.
    In short, the achievements of China's ceramic industry in recent years are undeniable. How should we further improve in the future? The upcoming National Ceramics Conference will have a comprehensive and important discussion on this. Here, I will only talk about some superficial opinions after seeing this exhibition.
    First, we must restore and inherit the inherent excellent traditional techniques (such as colored glazes, underglaze blue, and other aspects) and develop and improve from the original foundation. For example, there is a vase with intertwined lotus patterns in underglaze red imitating the Qianlong era in this exhibition, which was fired very successfully. Based on this technology, we can produce practical utensils decorated with underglaze red, and we should not be satisfied with merely imitating this intertwined lotus vase. Similarly, we can also produce Kangxi famille rose with gold products. However, in our thinking, we must eliminate the tendencies of restorationism and conservatism. Our purpose is not to imitate the ancients, copy the ancients, or simulate the ancients; it is not imitation for the sake of imitation. Instead, we must create works that meet the requirements of the new era and are loved by the broad masses of people based on mastering this technique.
    Secondly, unnecessary artistic processing wastes manpower and material resources, increases product costs, and the superfluous processing may not be appreciated by the people. As a result, the finished products cannot be sold and become inventory. Taking the large plates and vases with "ten thousand flowers without end" as an example, this costly and vulgar production method originated in the Qianlong era and was designed to serve the court and the privileged class. Originally, porcelain has its own inherent artistic value. If the white glaze is covered with tangled flowers and leaves, and the colors are so complex and cluttered, it loses its sense of beauty. "Ten thousand flowers without end" is just the most prominent example. Similar excessive processing can be found on many other utensils, which is a problem worthy of attention and research.
    What will be the direction in the future? In addition to some art porcelain, we should earnestly work on daily-use porcelain. First, we must improve the quality of the porcelain. The body should be delicate and relatively thin, and the glaze should be white to fully display the beauty of the porcelain itself. This can be achieved as soon as possible in terms of standardizing porcelain clay and glaze materials. Second, we need to require appropriate and beautiful shapes, as well as standardized product specifications, which require careful design and improved tools. At the same time, quality and shape must meet practical requirements. For example, some bowls and vases in Jingdezhen porcelain are imitating the so-called "Guyuexuan" thin-bodied utensils with fake Tang Ying inscriptions from the late Guangxu period, which have no practical value at all. Third, when the quality of the porcelain and the shape of the utensils have been improved to a considerable extent, we should also pay attention to appropriate artistic processing. This artistic processing—painting—must take into account practicality, economy, and the inherent style of the nation, and should never waste manpower and material resources to blindly pursue form.
    Overall, this exhibition features more than 1,200 pieces of Jingdezhen porcelain and 600 to 700 pieces of ceramics from other regions. This is the first national review of ceramics. At this exhibition, various regions have the opportunity to observe and learn from each other, learn from others' strengths and make up for their own shortcomings, correct the past attitude of arrogance and looking down on everything, humbly accept criticism from all parties, bury themselves in research, and work towards improving and popularizing daily-use porcelain. Then, when the second national ceramics exhibition is held in a year or two, it will definitely present a new and even more advanced atmosphere.

    从我国瓷器的发展谈到“全国陶瓷展览会”
    陈万里
    瓷器是我国的伟大发明之一。它发展中的一个重要阶段，就是烧成瓷器的胎质，从不透明体而达到了半透明体，这是经过了无数劳动人民的智慧创造和长时期艰苦辛勤的操作才获得的。但是，只烧成一种素面的瓷器，在器物的表面上呈现的光亮面只有白色的一种，是不能满足人民群众的要求的，于是又发明了色釉，首先发明的是青釉。
    釉是一种矽酸盐。施釉在素地（即成形的胎）上，经过火烧，就成了有釉的光亮面，便于洗拭，不致被尘土或腥秽所污染。在釉药里，要是加上了某种氧化金属，经过火烧以后，就会显现出某种固有的色泽，这就是色釉。例如加了氧化铁的色釉，在氧化火里烧了呈黄色，经过还原火就成了青色，这就是青釉。从东汉末期到六朝时候，在半瓷质的器物上，已普遍使用青釉，但是在技术方面，还掌握得很不够。经过隋唐以至北宋的汝州瓷、南宋的龙泉窑，才达到了完成阶段。这一种碧玉般、海水般的色釉，从来为全世界爱好我国瓷器的人们所企慕和喜爱。它是我国瓷器发展史上第一个极重要的发现。继青釉瓷的烧成，应用氧化铜而烧成了红的色釉，这种釉首先见于钧窑的器物上的紫红斑，仿佛在蔚蓝的万里晴空，涌现出一片红霞那样的灿烂。嗣后经过南宋末期和元代的不断试制，成为明代永乐、宣德时所谓的鲜红和宝石红。清代康熙时仿制这种色釉，就有所谓郎窑红、豇豆红等种种名称。这种红色釉，从南宋末期到清初，其间曾有时失传，有时恢复，断续了好几次，原因主要在于使用氧化铜的含量和还原火的处理是否适当。但是这种绚丽夺目的釉色，始终是我国瓷器发展史上光辉的发明之一。和红色釉发现的同时，又发明了青花。先是用氧化钴配成绘色剂，用来在尚未经过火烧的素地上绘画，罩上白釉，然后进窑去烧，结果在洁白光润的瓷器上，出现了淡雅宁静的一种青色的图画。这就是彩绘的开始。同时，由于这种釉下彩的发见，从而对于釉上彩的发展，也起了极大的推进作用。
    此外，由于宋代的封建经济已经达到了相当高度的水平，手工业生产的组织有了很细的分工，技术也比较唐代提高了，所以各地方的陶瓷工艺，非常发达。除了青釉以外，红色釉和釉下青花，也正在那几百年间孕育滋长。河北、河南、山西、陕西、江西、福建、广东等地，都风起云涌地创造了许多烧造陶瓷的新的方法，并且都带着浓厚的地方色彩和各地特有的风格。
    我国陶瓷工艺，就是这样经过千数百年来继续不断的创造、发展，获得了国际的荣誉。但是近百年来，外因帝国主义的侵入，内因从满清政府以至军阀和国民党的反动统治，国产陶瓷业一直呻吟于苛捐杂税和外瓷倾销的双重压迫之下，产品因之低落，有许多技术失传了。同时，由于为了获取官僚、地主和新兴买办阶级的喜爱，造型、色釉和装饰图案，都流于庸俗怪诞，丑态百出，向来著名全国的景德镇瓷业，也是千疮百孔，奄奄待毙了。
    解放后，由于党和人民政府极大的关怀和重视，各地陶瓷业的面貌已逐渐改观了。即使在偏僻地区，也都踊跃生产，供应广大人民的需要。这是我国陶瓷业起死回生的一个重要的转机时期。在这样的情况下，目前正在举办的“全国陶瓷展览会”，当然有重要的意义。
    以景德镇的产品来说，从这次展览会上就可以看到在技术上有不少可喜的成绩：
    第一是红釉的烧成，并经化学分析，把成分和含量作了科学的记录，我们应该向景德镇的老艺人们欢呼道贺这件大喜事。今后要进一步研究怎样来把握和控制还原火，就是说已往仅凭经验来测定火度的，今后一定要依靠科学来生产。
    第二是失传了很久的乌金釉，也烧成功了。听说景德镇的老艺人们都愿意贡献出自己多年辛勤工作中获得的经验，集体研究、创造，因此，其他失传了的鳝鱼黄、茶叶末等，也已烧得很不错了。
    第三是青花的烧制，也有了很大成就。但据说由于使用珠明料的分量没有标准，因而青色的程度很有差别，这不成什么了不起的问题，因为青的色泽，是可能追踪到康熙时代的标准的。
    第四是最近一年来新品种的生产，如雕塑的瓷像等是有相当成绩的，许多英雄模范人物、历史人物的造像，代替了过去那些陈旧的不健康的瓷雕。
    这次展览会中，还选择陈列了各地的产品，虽不全面，也可以大致看出全国陶瓷工艺在解放以来的一个新的面貌，而且其中有不少优良的产品。例如广东饶平的日用瓷，彩绘的花卉鱼鸟，比较简洁而不繁琐，比较淡雅而不穠俗，瓷胎比较的薄而细致，釉也比较的细而润泽，同时由于釉下彩的一次烧成，省料、省人力而减低了成本，是符合于实用、经济而兼顾到美观的。这些展品，可以给各地陶瓷工艺一种鼓励和启发。广东佛山石湾的陶器中，还有好些新品种，而蓝釉器的显亮明朗的程度，更是从唐三彩以后所未曾见到的。河北峰峰的白地黑花的制品，在这次展览会中也很突出。展品中有仿宋的作品四件，虽系仿制，确能看出依然保存着宋代的优良技巧。安徽界首的陶器，色彩清亮；山东淄博的日用套盆，虽只红绿两色的花卉，色彩却极明快；也都值得提及。可惜山西的黑釉，四川荣昌烧酒坊多种多样的陶器和福建德化的日用瓷，都来不及赶上参加展出。
    总之，这几年来我国陶瓷业的成就是肯定的。此后应该怎样进一步的提高，在即将召开的全国陶瓷会议上，会有全面的和重要的讨论，这里只谈谈我在看了这次展览会以后的一些粗浅意见。
    首先，要恢复和继承固有的优良的传统技术（如色釉、青花等种种方面），并从原有基础上向前发展和提高。举例说，这次展品中有一件仿乾隆时代釉里红的缠枝莲瓶，烧得是很成功的，就可以在这个技术的基础上，来烧制用釉里红为装饰画的实用器皿，决不因仿制成了这件缠枝莲瓶，就可以满足了。同样地，也可以制出康熙五彩加金的成品。但在我们的思想上，必须肃清复古的和保守的倾向，我们的目的，不是仿古、摹古、拟古，不是为仿制而仿制，而是要在掌握了这个技巧的基础上，来创造合乎新时代的要求而为广大人民所喜爱的作品。
    其次，不必要的美术加工，浪费了人力、物力，增高了产品成本，而赘余的加工的结果，又未必为人民所爱好，因而成品销不出去，成了仓底货。以“万花不到头”的大型的盘和瓶为例，这种不计成本而又庸俗的制作方法，倡始于乾隆时代，是专为宫庭和特权阶级服务的。本来，瓷器自有它本身的美术价值，要是在白釉上，涂满了纠缠不清的花叶，色调又是那样错综芜杂，就失去了它的美感了。“万花不到头”不过是一个最突出的例子，其他不少器皿上，也都能发见这种类似的过分加工，这是值得注意研究的一个问题。
    此后的方向，究竟将怎样呢？除了一部分美术瓷以外，应切实的向日用瓷方面下功夫。第一，必须提高瓷的质量，胎要细致，使之比较的薄一些，釉要洁白，使充分发挥出瓷的本身的美，这是在瓷土、釉料求得标准化方面可能及早做得到的。第二，要求造形的适当和美化，以及制品的规格化，那就需要设计的审慎和工具的改进。同时质量和造形必须符合实用的要求，例如现在景德镇瓷器中有一种向光绪末年假冒唐英题款的所谓“古月轩”的薄胎器皿看齐的碗和瓶，是丝毫没有实用价值的。第三，瓷的质量和器皿的造形，有了相当的提高，同时就应注意适当的美术加工。这种美术加工——彩绘，必须照顾到实用、经济和民族的固有风格，绝对不是浪费人力和物力来盲目的追求形式。
    总起来说，这次展览，景德镇瓷器有一千二百余件，其他各地陶瓷也有六、七百件，这是第一次全国陶瓷的检阅。在这个展览会上，各地得有互相观摩学习的机会，取人之长，补己之短，纠正过去自高自大、傲视一切的态度，虚心接受各方面的批评，埋头研究，向提高和普及日用瓷方面进行工作，那么，一年或两年以后举行第二次全国陶瓷展览的时候，定能呈现出更进一步的新气象来。
