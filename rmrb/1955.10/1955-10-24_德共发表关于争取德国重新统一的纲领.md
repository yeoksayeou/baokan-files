Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 22nd: According to a report from Deutsche Presse-Agentur, Dusseldorf: The German Communist Party held a press conference in Dusseldorf on the 20th, announcing the German Communist Party's program on the necessary steps to make Germany reunified into a peace-loving country. The program pointed out that the establishment of a European collective security system and the establishment of a genuine democratic order in West Germany are the prerequisites for German reunification.

The program pointed out that one of the main tasks of the working people and peace forces in West Germany is to make the West German government change its foreign and domestic policies. Further relaxation of the European situation largely depends on West Germany's policies. Any further steps to implement the Paris Agreement must be stopped. The program said that the German Communist Party demands a fundamental change in the policies of the Federal Republic, which will create the prerequisites for the Germans themselves to solve the problem of reunifying Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis.

The program emphasized that Germans who aspire to reunification must support the demand for "Germans to sit down at the same table." The development of economic and cultural relations between the two Germanys will help to approach each other. The responsibility of the German working class for the fate of Germany makes it necessary for the workers and their organizations in both parts of Germany to reach an understanding on joint action.

In its program, the German Communist Party called on all forces opposed to the Paris Agreement, against rearmament, and against the Adenauer government's dictatorial rule to unite in a national and democratic people's movement to fight, and the working class must overcome the state of division. The program expressed the hope that members of the Social Democratic Party would break away from the influence of the Social Democratic Party leaders, listen to the appeal of the German Communist Party, and support the policy of mutual understanding and joint action by the working class to oppose militarism and strive for the establishment of a new democratic order in West Germany.

The program also pointed out the necessity of establishing an alliance with the peasants.

    德共发表关于争取德国重新统一的纲领
    新华社柏林二十二日电　据德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫讯：德国共产党二十日在杜塞尔多夫举行记者招待会，宣布德国共产党关于使德国重新统一成为爱好和平国家的必需步骤的纲领。纲领指出，建立欧洲集体安全体系和在西德建立真正的民主秩序，是德国重新统一的先决条件。
    纲领指出，西德劳动人民和和平力量当前的主要任务之一是要使西德政府改变外交和内政政策。进一步缓和欧洲局势很大程度上要看西德的政策。任何进一步实施巴黎协定的步骤必需停止。纲领说，德国共产党要求根本改变联邦共和国的政策，这将为德国人自己在民主和和平的基础上解决重新统一德国的问题创造先决条件。
    纲领着重指出，渴望重新统一的德国人必需支持“德国人坐到一张桌子旁边来”的要求。两个德国间发展经济和文化关系将有助于相互接近。德国工人阶级对德国命运的责任，使得德国两部分的工人和他们的组织必需在联合行动上获得谅解。
    德国共产党在纲领中号召所有反对巴黎协定，反对重新武装、反对阿登纳政府独裁统治的力量，在一个民族和民主的人民运动中团结起来进行斗争，工人阶级必需克服分裂状况。纲领表示希望社会民主党党员摆脱社会民主党领袖的影响，听取德国共产党的呼吁，支持互相谅解、工人阶级联合行动来反对军国主义和争取在西德建立新的民主秩序的政策。
    纲领并且指出同农民建立联盟的必要性。
