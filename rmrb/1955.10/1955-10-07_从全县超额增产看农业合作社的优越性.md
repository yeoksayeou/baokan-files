    The Superiority of Agricultural Cooperatives Seen from the County's Over-Production
    Song Shudai, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Hejian County Committee

                            (I)
    Hejian County, Hebei Province, is a region that was liberated relatively early, with a high degree of mass awareness, a strong Party organization, and a good foundation for mutual assistance and cooperation. Most of the county's cultivated land is dry land, with irrigated land accounting for less than 19%. This year, in order to achieve large-scale production increases, the CPC Hejian County Committee led the county's farmers in adopting a series of production-increasing measures for various crops. The growth of various crops is as follows: cotton plants are large with many bolls, millet plants are tall with thick stalks and uniform ears, sweet potato vines are small but the tubers are large, and peanut plants are strong with dense fruits. Farmers said: We haven't seen such good crops in years. Judging from the growth, the harvest of various crops will greatly exceed the planned yields. The county planted a total of 1,845,623 mu of grain crops (including wheat) this year, with a planned yield of 116 jin per mu, for a total output of 214,090,000 jin. It is now estimated that the yield per mu will be 130 jin, for a total output of 239,930,000 jin, exceeding the planned total grain output by 12% and exceeding the average grain output of the three years from 1952 to 1954 by 58.4%. The county planted a total of 160,480 mu of cotton, with a planned yield of 94 jin per mu (seed cotton, the same below), for a total output of 15,080,000 jin. It is now estimated that the yield per mu will be 140 jin, for a total output of 22,460,000 jin, exceeding the planned total output by 48.8% and exceeding the average output of the previous three years by 100%. Other economic crops such as peanuts and sesame can also exceed the planned yields. The fact of increased production has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. Many farmers said: Looking at the crops gives us energy to work. Now the county's farmers are actively engaged in the late-stage management of late-maturing crops and the meticulous harvesting of the autumn harvest, striving for over-production.
    The CPC Hejian County Committee's leadership of the county's annual agricultural production increase movement was carried out by relying closely on agricultural production cooperatives to drive the broad masses of farmers. Therefore, it not only guaranteed the over-fulfillment of the county's annual grain and cotton production increase tasks, but also created extremely favorable conditions for further developing mutual assistance and cooperation and implementing county-wide agricultural collectivization.
    In 1953, the county had 743 agricultural production cooperatives, with peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 13.4% of the total peasant households. In the autumn and winter of 1954, the number of agricultural cooperatives increased to 1,656, with 48,109 peasant households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 53.55% of the county's total peasant households. After these cooperatives were established, they were not only consolidated through rectification, but also greatly demonstrated their superiority in this year's agricultural production increase movement. According to a survey of the autumn harvest distribution calculations of agricultural cooperatives, 90.1% of the county's 1,656 cooperatives had yields exceeding those of mutual aid teams and individual farmers; 7.9% of the cooperatives had yields roughly equal to those of mutual aid teams and individual farmers; and only 32 cooperatives had yields lower than those of mutual aid teams and individual farmers due to poor management. Furthermore, from a survey of all the production-increasing cooperatives, those with yields exceeding those of mutual aid teams and individual farmers by about 10% accounted for 38.5% of the production-increasing cooperatives; those with yields exceeding by 20% to 30% accounted for 49.2%; and those with yields exceeding by 40% or more accounted for 12.1%. This year, the county's agricultural production cooperatives can produce a total of 156,430,000 jin of grain and 14,650,000 jin of cotton. This year, 65.2% of the county's total agricultural output was obtained by relying on agricultural production cooperatives. This situation shows that agricultural production cooperatives have occupied an extremely important position in the entire agricultural production movement. It can be seen that concentrating the main force on running agricultural cooperatives well is the only way to achieve a large increase in agricultural production.

                             (II)
    Why can agricultural production cooperatives increase production?

    First, agricultural cooperatives have greatly tapped the potential capacity of the land. In the past, when farmers operated separately, they planted crops according to their own eating habits, which severely restricted the exploitation of soil fertility. This year, each cooperative planted various crops according to the properties of different soil types. Generally, white sandy soil is used to grow cotton, peanuts, and sweet potatoes; black soil is used to grow millet and corn; and low-lying areas are used to grow sorghum and rice. This not only effectively guaranteed the full realization of the state's planting plan, but also greatly tapped the potential capacity of the land. According to surveys, this year, agricultural cooperatives increased yields by an average of 15% by planting according to local conditions, and more than 100,000 mu of land avoided losses from flooding. The two large cooperatives, Hongxing and Mingxing, in Dongshijing Village (a total of 837 households) increased their grain income (economic crops converted to grain) by 500,000 jin due to planting according to local conditions. In the past, when operating separately, some farmers were "outsiders in farming" and some impoverished households lacked labor and livestock, so the land they planted was in a "semi-abandoned" state every year, and the annual harvest was generally about 40% lower than the yield of land with the same soil quality. After these households joined the cooperative, the land was managed by the cooperative, and this year it generally reached the yield level of land with the same soil quality. For example, Sun Guozhong, a member of the Lianmeng Cooperative in Hongyan Village, Fanzhuang District, had three family members and one laborer, and cultivated 13 mu of land. He had been weaving baskets since he was a child and did not understand farming techniques, so he had been planting very poorly year after year. After joining the cooperative, the land was well planted, and the 13 mu of land produced a total of 520 jin more grain than before joining the cooperative. Among the county's 1,656 cooperatives, there are 9,622 households lacking farming techniques and labor, with 100,5842 mu of land. Calculated at an increase of 40 jin of grain per mu, the total increase is 4,230,000 jin. After poor peasants joined the cooperative, they also solved the problems of lacking livestock, farm tools, and extensive cultivation, which delayed farming time, and yields generally increased by 25%. Due to unified land management, many ditches, ridges, boundaries, and headlands were eliminated, expanding the cultivated land area. Agricultural cooperatives in the county increased the cultivated land area by 45,000 mu from this alone, increasing grain production by 5,850,000 jin, calculated at 130 jin of grain per mu. In addition, many agricultural cooperatives reclaimed some virgin or fallow land, which also increased grain production significantly.

    Second, agricultural cooperatives use labor in a unified manner, implement the principle of equal pay for equal work, greatly stimulate the labor enthusiasm of cooperative members, and improve labor efficiency. According to a survey of 1,306 cooperatives, labor efficiency generally increased by more than 20% due to the implementation of different forms of contracted work, such as temporary, seasonal, and permanent contracts. Farm work is done better, faster, and more timely. This avoids losses due to delayed farming time. The benefits of improved labor efficiency are especially evident during the busy farming season. In August of this year, the river rose sharply, and more than 200,000 mu of land in the county was affected by insect pests. Five districts showed severe drought, and cotton and grain crops were in a period of great need for management. Flood control, pest control, drought resistance and other farm work were squeezed together. At this time, all the labor in the agricultural cooperatives was mobilized, with some going to the dike for flood control and some staying at home to produce. Men resisted drought, and women sorted cotton and removed insects. With such a planned and unified distribution of labor, insect pests were promptly eliminated, and grain and cotton crops received timely management, and 35,000 mu of land was irrigated in the five drought-stricken areas. None of the agricultural cooperatives had a single mu of weedy land or seedling deaths due to drought. Last year, in the same season, more than 300,000 mu of crops were affected by weeds and reduced harvests due to poor labor allocation. This year, some individual farmers also suffered from insufficient labor, and the crops could not be managed in time, affecting the harvest.

    Improved labor efficiency has also greatly strengthened the management of various crops compared with previous years. In the past, cotton was generally hoeed four to five times. This year, cooperatives not only hoeed one to two more times, but also implemented fine pruning on more than 80% of the cotton; grain crops were also hoeed one more time. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, 1,159 cooperatives in the county extracted more than 16,000 laborers during the busy summer farming season to carry out high-temperature composting, improving the quality of fertilizer accumulation. The two large cooperatives, Hongxing and Mingxing, in Dongshijing Village accumulated a total of more than 41,610,000 jin of fertilizer this year, applying an average of 3,310 jin of fertilizer per mu, exceeding the fertilizer application rate of 1,510 jin per mu last year.

    Third, agricultural production cooperatives have the conditions for collective management, and production technology has been greatly improved and improved compared with mutual aid teams and individual farmers. In terms of intensive cultivation, all cooperatives in the county generally carried out top-tilting harrowing in early spring, generally harrowing two to three times, and applied different cultivation techniques according to different soil types and previous crops: alkaline land was harrowed early and coarsely, sticky land was harrowed more finely, and sandy land was harrowed late, so that all spring white land in the cooperative retained good moisture and achieved timely sowing and complete emergence. The county has a total of 1,614 seven-inch plows and 418 double-wheeled double-furrow plows; agricultural cooperatives own 1,323 plows, and all double-wheeled double-furrow plows belong to agricultural cooperatives. Plowing with a new-style plow is more than one inch deeper than with an old-style plow. The plowing efficiency of a double-wheeled double-furrow plow is two to three times higher than that of an old-style plow. In terms of promoting improved varieties, more than 80% of the valley land in the county's agricultural cooperatives selected the three improved varieties of Huanong No. 4, Qitoubai, and Laohuwe, which have high yields and strong drought resistance. 1,115 cooperatives planted all 88,752 mu of cotton (accounting for 55% of the county's total cotton mu) with the improved variety of Wuai cotton. The county planted a total of 89,284 mu of sweet potatoes, and 66,963 mu were replaced with the improved variety of Shengli Baihao, of which 60,266 mu were replaced by agricultural cooperatives, accounting for 90% of the county's improved variety area. The yield of Shengli Baihao improved variety generally reaches 3,000 jin per mu, which is more than 150% higher than the yield of local varieties. In terms of appropriate close planting, cotton was generally planted at about 2,300 plants per mu in the past. This year, 72,314 mu of cotton in agricultural cooperatives (accounting for 45% of the county's total cotton field area) were planted with more than 3,000 plants per mu, an increase of about 800 plants per mu. Mutual aid teams and individual farmers only increased by 400 plants per mu. This year, agricultural cooperatives planted 2,800 sweet potato plants per mu, an increase of 600 plants compared to the past, while mutual aid teams and individual farmers only increased by 300 plants per mu. In terms of fertilization, the county accumulated more than 840 million jin of fertilizer in the summer as of the end of August, including 288.8 million jin of high-temperature compost, accounting for 34.4% of the total summer fertilizer accumulation. High-temperature compost is all from agricultural cooperatives. The county sold a total of 2,806,800 jin of fine fertilizer throughout the year, of which agricultural cooperatives purchased 2,169,000 jin. Agricultural cooperatives not only have a large quantity and good quality of fertilizer, but also pay attention to fertilization techniques, generally applying fertilizer in stages, mixing it, and applying it in ditches and holes at the right time. In other aspects, such as strengthening field management and timely irrigation, agricultural cooperatives surpass individual farmers. Due to the improvement of farming techniques by agricultural cooperatives, three characteristics have appeared on the land within the cooperatives: loose soil and fewer weeds, more fertilizer and fewer insects, and more plants, larger ears, and higher yields. For example, the two cooperatives in Dongcun planned a total output (economic crops converted to grain) of 3,267,681 jin of grain, but can actually produce 5,330,927 jin of grain. The average income per cooperative member is 5,611 jin of grain, more than double the income of local individual farmers (average income of 2,851 jin).

    Fourth, the collective property within the cooperative has increased, and the investment strength is great. As of the beginning of September, the county had increased livestock by 2,778 heads, of which agricultural cooperatives purchased 75%. The county increased more than 4,300 pigs in the summer, of which cooperatives purchased 85%. The county sold a total of 33,000 old-fashioned main farm tools such as drills, plows, and harrows throughout the year, of which agricultural cooperatives purchased more than 23,100. This not only promoted increased production in the current year, but also greatly increased the capacity for expanded reproduction.

    (III)
    Due to the significant increase in production of agricultural production cooperatives and the universal increase in income of cooperative members, the enthusiasm and confidence of farmers in running cooperatives have been further encouraged. Many cooperative members reported: I didn't quite believe the benefits of joining the cooperative earlier, but now I have personally experienced it. Some cooperative members who had once wavered said: I won't leave the cooperative even if you beat me with a stick. The increase in production of the cooperatives has had a huge impact on farmers outside the cooperatives, and many people have requested to join the cooperatives. Households that withdrew during the rectification of the cooperative are now approaching the staff of the cooperative and saying: "I didn't figure it out in the spring, please allow me to join the cooperative again!" Many individual farmers are actively establishing relationships with agricultural cooperatives during this year's autumn harvest, saying: "We will be members of the cooperative after the autumn harvest." According to incomplete statistics in the county in early September, more than 200 cooperative frameworks have been set up, and 13,447 farmers have signed up to request to join the cooperative.

    The significant increase in production of agricultural production cooperatives and the fact that farmers are actively requesting to join the cooperatives have also profoundly educated the county and district leaders. Those who originally discussed that "too many cooperatives have been established, the pace has been too fast, exceeding the level of mass awareness, exceeding the level of leadership" have now examined their right-leaning thinking and realized that their original views were wrong. Those who were timid when encountering difficulties during the rectification of the cooperative have now also realized their shortcomings in lacking enthusiasm for the socialist cause. Based on the above situation, the CPC Hejian County Committee convened a county-wide Party representatives meeting on September 9. At the meeting, the right-leaning emotions and various erroneous ideas existing among Party members and cadres regarding agricultural collectivization were systematically examined and criticized; and on the basis of improved awareness, the development plan for mutual assistance and cooperation for the next three years was studied and discussed; it was required that on the basis of the households that have already joined the cooperative accounting for 53.55% of the total number of farmers, the number of households joining the cooperative should be increased to 75% in the autumn and winter of this year, more than 85% in 1956, and 90% of the total number of households in 1957. The meeting also studied the consolidation of old cooperatives, proposing to ensure the completion of two things: autumn production and income distribution of the cooperative, so that all cooperatives in the county will be further improved and consolidated. All Party members and cadres participating in the meeting unanimously stated that they would resolutely implement the central government's policy of "overall planning and strengthening leadership," and that they must run agricultural production cooperatives in the county more and better in the future.

    从全县超额增产看农业合作社的优越性
    中共河间县委副书记  宋书岱
                            （一）
    河北省河间县是解放较早的地区，群众觉悟高，党的组织强，互助合作基础好。全县耕地大部为旱地，水浇地不足百分之十九。今年中共河间县委为达到大面积增产，领导全县农民对各种农作物采取了一系列的增产措施。各种农作物成长情况是：棉花棵大桃多，谷子棵高秆粗穗头齐，甘薯秧小块大，花生秧强果密。农民说：多少年了，没见过这样的好庄稼。从成长的情况看，各种作物的收获量都能大大超过计划产量。全县今年共种粮食作物（包括小麦）一百八十四万五千六百二十三亩，计划每亩产一百一十六斤，共产二万一千四百零九万斤，现估计每亩可产一百三十斤，共产二万三千九百九十三万斤，超过计划粮食总产量百分之十二，超过一九五二年至一九五四年三年的粮食平均产量百分之五十八点四。全县共种棉十六万零四百八十亩，计划每亩产九十四斤（籽棉，下同），共产一千五百零八万斤，现在估计每亩可产一百四十斤，共产二千二百四十六万斤，超过计划总产量百分之四十八点八，超过前三年平均产量的一倍。其它花生、芝麻等经济作物都能超过计划产量。增产的事实大大鼓舞了广大农民的生产积极性，不少农民说：看看庄稼，做起活来就有劲。现全县农民正在积极进行晚熟作物的后期管理和秋收中的精打细收，争取超额增产。
    中共河间县委对全年农业增产运动的领导，是紧紧依靠了农业生产合作社带动广大农民进行的。因此，不仅保证了全县全年粮、棉增产任务的超额完成，而且给进一步发展互助合作、实行全县农业合作化创造了极为有利的条件。
    全县一九五三年有农业生产合作社七百四十三个，入社农户占总农户的百分之十三点四。一九五四年秋、冬，农业合作社发展到一千六百五十六个，入社农户达四万八千一百零九户，占全县总农户的百分之五十三点五五。这些社建成以后，经过整顿，不但全部巩固下来，且在今年农业增产运动中大大显示了优越性。根据对农业合作社秋收分配计算的调查，全县一千六百五十六个社，有百分之九十点一的社产量超过互助组和个体农民；有百分之七点九的社产量大体同互助组和个体农户相等；只有三十二个社因经营管理不善，产量低于互助组和个体农户。再从全部增产社的调查看，产量超过互助组和个体农户百分之十左右的占增产社的百分之三十八点五；产量超过百分之二十至三十的，占百分之四十九点二；产量超过百分之四十以上的，占百分之十二点一。全县农业生产合作社今年共可产粮食一万五千六百四十三万斤，棉花一千四百六十五万斤。今年全县农业总产量中，有百分之六十五点二是依靠农业生产合作社获得的。这一情况说明，农业生产合作社已在整个农业生产运动中占着极为重要的地位。由此可见，集中主要力量办好农业合作社，是实行农业大量增产的唯一办法。 
                             （二）
    农业生产合作社为什么能增产呢？
    第一，农业合作社大大发挥了土地的潜在能力。过去农民分散经营时，都是按着自己的吃用习惯来种植，严重限制了地力的发挥。今年各个社都是根据不同土质的性能种植各种作物的。一般是白沙地种棉花、花生、甘薯；黑土地种谷子、玉米；低洼地种高粱、稻子等作物。这不仅有效地保证了国家种植计划的全部实现，并大大发挥了土地的潜在能力。据调查，今年农业合作社因地种植，一般提高产量百分之十五，并有十多万亩土地避免了受涝的损失。只东诗经村红星、明星两个大社（共八百三十七户）由于因地种植即增加粮食收入（经济作物折粮）五十万斤。过去分散经营时，农民中有一部分“种地外行户”和一部分缺乏劳力、畜力的孤寡户，所种的地每年呈现“半荒”状态，每年收获一般低于同等土质产量的百分之四十左右。这些户入社后，土地由社经营，今年一般达到同等土质地的产量水平。如樊庄区洪雁村联盟社的社员孙国中，三口人一个劳力，种地十三亩，他自小编筐不懂耕作技术，年年种得很不好。入社后种好了，十三亩地比入社前共多产粮食五百二十斤。全县一千六百五十六个社中，共有缺乏耕作技术和缺乏劳力的农户九千六百二十二户，有地十万零五千八百四十二亩，按每亩增产四十斤粮食计算，共增产四百二十三万斤。贫农入社后，也解决了过去缺畜力、缺农具、耕作粗放、贻误农时等问题，产量一般提高四分之一。由于土地统一经营，取消了不少沟垅、地界、地边、横头，扩大了耕地面积，全县农业合作社只这一项，即增加耕地面积四万五千亩，按每亩产粮一百三十斤计算，增产了粮食五百八十五万斤。此外，不少农业合作社开垦了一部分生荒地或熟荒地，都增产了不少粮食。
    第二，农业合作社劳力统一使用，贯彻着同劳同酬原则，大大发挥了社员的劳动积极性，提高了劳动效率。据对一千三百零六个社的调查，由于实行了临时、季节、常年等不同形式的包工制，劳动效率一般提高百分之二十以上。农活做得更好、更快、更及时了。这就避免了因贻误农时而遭受损失的现象。提高了劳动效率的好处，尤其在农事紧张季节表现得特别明显。今年八月，河水猛涨，全县二十多万亩地发生虫灾，有五个区呈现严重旱象，棉花、粮食作物又处在极需管理时期。防汛、除虫、抗旱等农活挤在一起。这时，农业合作社全部劳力一齐出动，一部分上堤防汛，一部分在家生产。男的抗旱，女的整理棉花和除虫。这样有计划地统一支配劳力，虫害及时扑灭了，粮食、棉花作物得到了适时管理，五个旱区浇地三万五千亩。全部农业合作社没有出现一亩草荒和因旱死苗的现象。去年在同一季节里，因劳力支配不好，有三十多万亩庄稼发生草荒，减少了收成。今年一部分单干农民，也因劳力不足，庄稼不能及时管理，影响了收成。
    劳动效率提高，对各种作物的管理也就比往年大大加强了。过去棉花一般都是锄四至五遍，今年各社不但多锄一至二遍，并有百分之八十以上的棉花实行了精细整枝；粮食作物也都多锄了一遍。在积肥上，全县有一千一百五十九个社在夏季农事繁忙季节，抽出了一万六千多个劳力进行了高温堆肥，提高了积肥质量。只东诗经村红星、明星两个大社，今年共积肥四千一百六十一万多斤，平均每亩施肥三千三百一十斤，超过去年每亩施肥量一千五百一十斤。
    第三，农业生产合作社因为具有集体经营的条件，生产技术比互助组和个体农民有了很大的改进和提高。在精耕细作方面，全县所有的社春初普遍开展了顶凌耙地，一般耙过二至三遍，并根据不同土质和前茬应用了不同的耕作技术：碱性地早耙粗耙，粘性地多耙细耙，沙性地晚耙，使社内全部春白地保住了好的墒情，达到适时播种，出苗齐全。全县共有七寸步犁一千六百一十四张，双轮双铧犁四百一十八部；农业合作社占有步犁一千三百二十三张，双轮双铧犁都是农业合作社的。使用新式步犁耕地，比旧式犁深耕一寸以上。双轮双铧犁耕地效率比旧式犁提高二至三倍。在推广优种方面，全县农业合作社百分之八十以上的谷地，选用了产量高、抗旱力强的华农四号、齐头白、老虎尾三种优种。有一千一百一十五个社的八万八千七百五十二亩棉花（占全县总棉花亩的百分之五十五）全部改种五爱棉优种。全县共种甘薯八万九千二百八十四亩，改用胜利百号优种的六万六千九百六十三亩，其中农业合作社改用的占六万零二百六十六亩，占全县优种面积的百分之九十。胜利百号优种每亩产量一般达三千斤，比本地种产量提高一倍半以上。在适当密植上，棉花过去每亩一般种二千三百株左右。今年农业合作社七万二千三百一十四亩棉花（占全县总棉田数的百分之四十五）每亩种植三千株以上，每亩增种八百株左右，互助组和个体农户每亩只增种四百株。农业合作社的甘薯今年每亩种二千八百棵，比过去增加六百棵，互助组和个体农户每亩只增种三百棵。在施肥上，全县截至八月底，夏季共积肥八亿四千万多斤，其中高温堆肥二亿八千八百万斤，占夏季总积肥量的百分之三十四点四。高温堆肥都是农业合作社的。全县全年共出售细肥二百八十万六千八百斤，其中农业合作社购买的占二百一十六万九千斤。农业合作社的施肥不但数量多，质量好，而且注意了施肥技术，一般都是分期施、混合施、适时沟施、穴施。其它如加强田间管理，适时灌溉等，农业合作社都超过个体农民。由于农业合作社改进了耕作技术，使社内土地上出现三个特点：土松草少，粪多虫子少，庄稼棵多、穗大、产量高。如东村两个社，计划总产量（经济作物折粮）为三百二十六万七千六百八十一斤粮，实际可产五百三十三万零九百二十七斤粮。每户社员平均收入五千六百一十一斤粮，超过当地个体农户（平均收入二千八百五十一斤）收入的一倍。
    第四，社内集体财产增加，投资力量大。截至九月初，全县共增加牲畜二千七百七十八头，农业社购买的占百分之七十五。全县夏季共增猪四千三百多口，社内购买的占百分之八十五。全县全年共出售旧式主要农具如耧、犁、耙等三万三千件，农业社购买的占二万三千一百多件。这不仅促使当年生产增加，并大大增加了扩大再生产的能力。（三）
    由于农业生产合作社增产显著，社员收入普遍增加，进一步鼓舞了农民办社的热情和信心。不少社员反映：早些说到社的好处时还有些不相信，现在真是亲身体验到了。有些曾经发生动摇的社员说：用棍打我也不出社了。社的增产对社外农民起了巨大的影响，许多人纷纷要求入社。整社时退出的户现在找社的工作人员说：“春天我没想通，允许我再入社吧！”不少个体农户在今年秋收中积极同农业合作社建立关系，他们说：“我们秋后就是社员了。”据九月初全县不完全统计，已搭起了社架子二百多个，报名请求入社的农民已有一万三千四百四十七户。
    农业合作社的显著增产和农民积极要求入社的事实，也深刻教育了县区领导人员。原来议论“社办多了，步子迈的大了，超过了群众觉悟程度，超过了领导水平”的工作人员，现在检查了自己的右倾思想，知道原来看法错了。整社时遇到困难而畏缩的人，现在也认识到自己对社会主义事业缺乏热情的缺点了。中共河间县委根据上述情况，在九月九日召开了全县党的代表会议。会上系统地检查、批判了在党员干部中对农业合作化存在的右倾情绪和各种错误思想；并在觉悟提高的基础上，研究讨论了今后三年互助合作的发展规划；要求在已入社户占总农户百分之五十三点五五的基础上，今年秋冬两季入社户发展到百分之七十五，一九五六年发展到百分之八十五以上，一九五七年发展到总户数的百分之九十。会议并对巩固老社作了研究，提出保证作好社的秋季生产和收益分配两件事情，使全县所有的社进一步得到提高和巩固。参加会的全体党员干部一致表示，要坚决贯彻中央“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，今后一定要把全县农业生产合作社办得更多更好。
