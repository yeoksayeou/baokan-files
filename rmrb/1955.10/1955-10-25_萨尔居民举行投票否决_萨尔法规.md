Xinhua News Agency, 24th Saar Dispatch: Saar region residents held a referendum on the "Saar Statute" on the 23rd. The voting lasted all day. According to the final official results announced by Saarbrücken, the capital of Saar, 67.7 percent of those who voted opposed the "Saar Statute," while only 32.2 percent voted in favor. The "Saar Statute" was rejected. After the announcement of the voting results, the Saar Hoffmann government, which supported the "Saar Statute," submitted its resignation.

The "Saar Statute" was signed last October by France and West Germany as part of the Paris Agreements. This statute was signed by the West German Adenauer government in exchange for the French ruling group's agreement to rearm West Germany. The "Saar Statute" stipulated that Saar would become a "Europeanized" region, separating the Saar region, part of Germany, from Germany, and placing it under the jurisdiction of a High Commissioner appointed by the Council of the Western European Union. The statute stipulated that France would continue to control Saar economically, and that the economic relations between West Germany and Saar would not harm French interests. This "Saar Statute" was widely opposed by Saar residents who demanded that Saar return to Germany.

The rejection of the "Saar Statute" has caused serious concern on the part of the United States and the United Kingdom. A Reuters report said that diplomatic sources in London "expressed deep concern" over the rejection of the "Saar Statute," arguing that the rejection of the "Saar Statute" could "restore the historical focus of Franco-German tensions" and that "the foundation upon which France agreed to rearm West Germany has also been undermined." The New York Herald Tribune said on the 24th that the Saar vote was a "serious blow" to the United States' "United Europe" cause.

After the "Saar Statute" was rejected, the ruling groups of West Germany and France put forward different claims on the Saar issue. A Reuters report said: Political observers in Bonn believe that "this vote will strengthen Chancellor Adenauer's position in any action to seek new negotiations with France on the Saar issue." West German Minister for All-German Affairs Kaiser immediately demanded on the evening of the 23rd that the Saar Hoffmann government resign and that new national elections be held in Saar.

The French government issued a communiqué on the results of the referendum on the "Saar Statute," saying: "The situation now formed can only be considered within the framework of existing institutions." Paris sources pointed out that this means maintaining the so-called "autonomous" status of Saar since the end of World War II, that is, alliance with France economically and, to a large extent, under French control politically.

### 萨尔居民举行投票否决“萨尔法规”

    萨尔居民举行投票否决“萨尔法规”
    新华社二十四日讯　萨尔消息：萨尔地区居民在二十三日就“萨尔法规”举行了公民投票。投票进行了一整天。据萨尔首府萨尔布鲁根宣布的投票最后正式结果，在投票的人中有百分之六十七点七表示反对“萨尔法规”，投票赞成的仅有百分之三十二点二，“萨尔法规”被否决了。投票结果宣布以后，支持“萨尔法规”的萨尔霍夫曼政府提出辞职。
    “萨尔法规”是去年十月法国和西德签订的，作为巴黎协定的一部分。这个法规是西德阿登纳政府为了换取法国统治集团同意重新武装西德的巴黎协定而签订的。“萨尔法规”规定萨尔成为“欧洲化”的地区，使德国的一部分萨尔同德国分离，而由西欧联盟理事会任命高级专员管辖。法规规定法国继续在经济上控制萨尔，并且规定西德同萨尔的经济关系不能损害法国的利益。这个“萨尔法规”遭到了要求使萨尔回到德国的萨尔居民的广泛反对。
    “萨尔法规”被否决引起了美国和英国方面的严重忧虑。路透社消息说，伦敦外交人士对“萨尔法规”被拒绝“表示深切的关怀”，拒绝“萨尔法规”可能“恢复历史性的法德关系的紧张焦点”，“法国同意重新武装西德的基础也遭到破坏。”“纽约先驱论坛报”二十四日说，萨尔投票结果是对美国的“统一欧洲”事业的“严重打击”。
    西德和法国的统治集团在“萨尔法规”被否决后对萨尔问题提出了不同的主张。路透社消息说：波恩政治观察家认为“这次投票将加强阿登纳总理在争取同法国就萨尔问题举行新的谈判的任何行动中的地位。”西德的全德事务部长凯撒在二十三日晚上马上要求萨尔霍夫曼政府辞职和在萨尔举行新的全国选举。
    法国政府就“萨尔法规”公民投票结果发表公报说：“现在形成的局势只能够在现存的机构的范围内来加以考虑”。巴黎人士指出，这就是要萨尔地位保持从第二次世界大战结束以来的所谓“自治”的现状，即在经济上同法国联盟，在政治上也在很大程度上受法国控制。
