Xinhua News Agency, October 10th. This fourth quarter will see nine newly built sugar refineries across the nation begin production. Among them, the state-owned Baotou Sugar Refinery, and the locally state-owned Jiamusi Sugar Refinery, Xinzhongguo Sugar Refinery, Neijiang Sugar Refinery, and Guangxi Sugar Refinery will each have an annual output of 20,000 to 30,000 tons of sugar. In addition, there are four smaller locally state-owned refineries: Guangdong Qingyuan Sugar Refinery, Xinqiao Sugar Refinery, Longtang Sugar Refinery on Hainan Island, and Guangzhou First Sugar Refinery. The equipment in these sugar refineries is mechanized. Once they are put into production, they can increase sugar production by over 100,000 tons annually.

China's sugar industry has developed rapidly in recent years. Except for Taiwan, Guangdong Province has always been the largest sugar-producing area in China. However, at the time of liberation, most of the large sugar refineries were destroyed, and the province's annual sugar output was only over 86,000 tons. In recent years, the destroyed sugar refineries have all resumed production, and the large-scale state-owned Zini Sugar Refinery was newly built the year before last. From last winter to this spring, Guangdong Province's sugar production has increased to 370,000 tons. Currently, there are more than 10,000 small-scale sugar workshops, 22 locally state-owned sugar refineries, and five larger state-owned sugar refineries operating in Guangdong Province. In 1949, the entire Northeast region only had one beet sugar refinery, the Acheng Sugar Refinery, with an annual output of only 7,000 tons. At that time, farmers in the Northeast region called sugar beets "worry knots." In recent years, with more people consuming sugar, the state has established five large sugar refineries with an annual output of over 100,000 tons. The market for sugar beets is also getting better every day. Now, farmers call sugar beets "golden knots" and "treasure knots."

### 全国新建九个糖厂将在第四季度投入生产

    全国新建九个糖厂将在第四季度投入生产
    新华社十日讯　今年第四季度全国将有九个新建糖厂投入生产。其中年产两万吨到三万吨糖的有国营包头糖厂和地方国营佳木斯糖厂、新中国糖厂、内江糖厂、广西糖厂。另外是四个较小的地方国营广东清远糖厂、新桥糖厂、海南岛龙塘糖厂、广州第一糖厂。这些糖厂的设备都是机械化的，投入生产后每年可以增产十几万吨糖。
    我国的制糖工业近几年发展很快。除台湾外，广东省一向是中国产糖最多的地方，可是刚解放时，大的糖厂多半被毁，全省年产糖只八万六千多吨。这几年来，被毁坏的糖厂都已恢复生产，前年又新建了一个规模相当大的国营紫坭糖厂。去年冬天到今年春天，广东省的产糖量已增加到三十七万吨。现在广东省经营小规模糖坊的有一万多家，地方国营糖厂有二十二个，还有五个较大的国营糖厂。一九四九年，全东北只有一个用甜菜制糖的阿城糖厂，年产才七千吨。那时东北地区的农民把甜菜叫做“愁疙瘩”；近几年吃糖的人多起来，国家开办了五个大糖厂，年产糖十万吨以上，甜菜的销路也一天比一天好。现在农民们把甜菜叫做“金疙瘩”、“宝贝疙瘩”了。
