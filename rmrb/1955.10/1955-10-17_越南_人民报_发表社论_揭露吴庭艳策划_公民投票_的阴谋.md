Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 16th -- The Vietnam "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 15th, exposing the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's conspiracy to stage a "referendum" on October 23rd.

The editorial said that Ngo Dinh Diem is currently stepping up preparations to play a "referendum" trick arranged by the United States, in order to completely grasp power in his own hands and legitimize his dictatorial system. The editorial pointed out that Ngo Dinh Diem did this because his conspiracies and activities to sabotage the Geneva Accords, destroy Vietnam's peace and unification, and turn South Vietnam into an American colony have encountered increasingly strong opposition from the Vietnamese people.

The "People's Daily" further revealed that after this "referendum" trick, which intends to abolish Bao Dai and make Ngo Dinh Diem "Head of State" or "President," the Ngo Dinh Diem clique will further play tricks, such as formulating a constitution and organizing unilateral general elections to create a puppet parliament.

The editorial emphasized that after the Ngo Dinh Diem clique realizes the above plan, it will establish a Syngman Rhee, Chiang Kai-shek-style fascist system in South Vietnam. They will openly declare their refusal to implement the Geneva Accords, then formally join South Vietnam into the American aggressive bloc, realize the conspiracy to split Vietnam, and sell South Vietnam to the United States as a military base for preparing for war.

The editorial called on the Vietnamese people to crush Ngo Dinh Diem's conspiracy to hinder Vietnam's independence and unification.

    越南“人民报”发表社论
    揭露吴庭艳策划“公民投票”的阴谋
    新华社河内十六日电　越南“人民报”十五日发表社论，揭露吴庭艳集团准备在十月二十三日举行“公民投票”的阴谋。
    社论说，目前吴庭艳正在加紧准备耍一个由美国所安排的“公民投票”把戏，以便把政权完全掌握在他一个人手里和使他的独裁制度合法化。社论指出，吴庭艳之所以这样做，是因为他的破坏日内瓦协定，破坏越南的和平和统一，把越南南方变为美国殖民地的阴谋和活动，遇到了越南人民的日益强烈的反对。
    “人民报”进一步揭露，在这个打算废除保大和让吴庭艳当“国长”或“总统”的“公民投票”把戏耍过以后，吴庭艳集团还将进一步玩弄把戏，例如制定宪法以及组织片面普选来制造一个傀儡国会等。
    社论强调指出，吴庭艳集团在实现了以上的计划后，就将在越南南方建立一个李承晚、蒋介石式的法西斯制度。他们将公开地宣布不执行日内瓦协定，然后使越南南方正式加入美国的侵略集团，实现分裂越南的阴谋，并且把越南南方出卖给美国做为准备战争的军事基地。
    社论号召越南人民粉碎吴庭艳这种阻碍越南的独立和统一的阴谋。
