The Yangtze River Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications River Transport Management Bureau, in order to improve the freight transportation work between Shanghai and Chongqing, has allocated two cargo ships to operate direct transportation between Shanghai and Chongqing starting in October. The "People No. 6" vessel loaded more than 300 tons of goods from Shanghai on October 2nd and sailed to Chongqing. The "People No. 2" vessel also loaded grain from Chongqing on October 6th and sailed to Shanghai. From now on, a direct cargo ship will sail between Shanghai and Chongqing every nine days. The sailing time from Shanghai to Chongqing can be shortened from the original twenty days to eleven to thirteen days. This will provide excellent conditions for accelerating commodity circulation and ensuring material supply. (Li Zhenhua)

    上海重庆间开辟直达运输航线
    交通部河运管理总局长江航运管理局为了改进上海到重庆间的货运工作，从十月份起，调配了两艘货轮行驶上海和重庆间进行直达运输。人民六号轮已于十月二日自上海载货三百余吨开往重庆，人民二号轮也在十月六日自重庆载粮食开往上海。今后上海、重庆两港每隔九天就有一艘直达货轮开航，上海至重庆的航行期限可由原来二十天缩短到十一天至十三天。这样将为加速商品流转、保证物资供应提供了优良条件。（李震华）
