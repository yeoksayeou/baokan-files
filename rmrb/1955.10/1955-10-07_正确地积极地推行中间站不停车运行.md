    Correctly and Actively Promote Non-stop Running Through Intermediate Stations
    Zhang Youmin
    Under the active leadership of advanced drivers Ma Yupu and Sun Shigui, and advanced dispatchers Xu Kejun and Zhang Wanjun, of the Harbin Railway Bureau, non-stop running through intermediate stations has become a mass movement in the national railway system. In the Qiqihar, Jilin, Jinzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Shanghai, and Liuzhou Railway Bureaus, it is also being promoted in depth after pilot projects. The practice of promoting this experience proves that it is an effective method for tapping potential. It reduces the operation time of trains at water supply stations, the meeting time on single-track lines, the overtaking and waiting time on double-track lines, and the additional time for train starts and stops, thereby increasing the travel speed of trains and accelerating the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock. It facilitates the adjustment of train operations, reduces single locomotives, and improves the organization of train operation. By making fuller use of inertial running, it can save a large amount of fuel for locomotives and create more favorable conditions for exceeding axle load standards. After this experience becomes a mass practice, it can also save the cost of water supply stations. In addition, it can shorten the working hours of locomotive crew members and improve the operating skills of locomotive crew members and the command skills of dispatchers.
    Precisely for these reasons, it has attracted the attention of the leadership of various railway bureaus for more than half a year, and certain measures have been taken to achieve remarkable results in this work. However, due to incorrect ideological understanding of some comrades and certain shortcomings in organizational work, the above-mentioned effects have not been fully realized. In particular, the purpose of better solving the connection of locomotives and trains in adjacent sections is not clear enough, so the acceleration of locomotive and rolling stock turnover has not achieved the due effect. In order to further promote non-stop running through intermediate stations and give full play to its role, it is necessary to correct the understanding of this work and correct the shortcomings in the work in a timely manner.
    First of all, the leading ideology should be clear that promoting non-stop running through intermediate stations is an active measure in the "full load, super-axle, five-hundred-kilometer movement." At present, some people oppose non-stop running through intermediate stations to the "full load, super-axle, five-hundred-kilometer movement," and neglect and relax the leadership of the "full load, super-axle, five-hundred-kilometer movement," which is wrong. For example, the Changchun Branch is the branch with the most non-stop runs through intermediate stations in the Harbin Railway Bureau, but the daily car kilometers in April were not completed. Some units one-sidedly summarize the role of non-stop running through intermediate stations by shortening the turnover time of rolling stock and the amount of super-axle, which is also wrong, which will weaken people's attention to the "full load, super-axle, five-hundred-kilometer movement" and the organization of train operation, thus creating the phenomenon of simply pursuing the number of non-stop runs through intermediate stations. Some comrades also saw some shortcomings in the current train operation organization work, and doubted the advanced Soviet experience of non-stop running through intermediate stations, which is also wrong. We should not only see that the connection between locomotives and trains in adjacent sections is not good, disrupting the timetable and affecting the order of operation, as well as the decline in the quality of locomotives and the occurrence of some accidents in some units, and think that it is meaningless to promote this experience. We should actively improve the train operation organization work by promoting this experience, and tap potential capabilities in the process of promoting this experience, to lay the foundation for formulating advanced timetables. We should not regard certain shortcomings in the current train operation organization work as an excuse to doubt or not promote this advanced experience.
    Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the planning of non-stop running through intermediate stations, criticize and overcome the practice of not asking for economic effects. At present, there are still phenomena of formalistic promotion and simply pursuing the number of runs in some units. Some only notify the driver to not stop at the intermediate station temporarily based on the running situation on the way. Some dispatchers order the forward train to wait to create the performance of the subsequent train not stopping at the intermediate station. In order for a train to reach "green street" (that is, the green light signal that allows the train to pass all the way), they do not hesitate to make more trains encounter "red street" (the red light signal that does not allow the train to pass). Some even to avoid meeting trains (in some sections of double-track lines and single-track lines) or due to the influence of forward trains, some trains do not operate according to the time specified in the timetable, and the dispatchers temporarily give points, increasing the running time. For example, Harbin Locomotive Depot No. 冖ㄢ1051 ran non-stop between Harbin and Anda twice on May 11, but the technical speed on that day was still 1.3 kilometers short of the plan. As for the phenomenon that trains running non-stop through intermediate stations arrive at the section station early and cannot be quickly connected and locomotives cannot be quickly turned around is not a rare example. For example, Locomotive No. 70 of the Changchun Locomotive Depot pulled a non-stop train from Changchun to Siping, and the trip only took two hours and forty-eight minutes, but the locomotive waited for four hours and twenty-seven minutes after arriving in Siping. These situations not only have no economic significance for accelerating the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock, but also cause confusion in the order of operation.
    In order to eliminate these unreasonable phenomena, in the future, we must criticize the departmentalism of simply pursuing the number of runs, and organize non-stop running through intermediate stations in a prepared and planned manner based on the flow of traffic and the situation of trains running in the two sections, and incorporate non-stop running through intermediate stations into the daily shift plan, to obtain the connection of connecting trains. At the same time, we must overcome the conservatism that the current daily shift plan lags behind the actual situation, further improve the level of the plan, and combine it well with the locomotive turnover chart, so that we can give full play to all aspects of potential and avoid wasting the effects obtained by non-stop running through intermediate stations.
    Again, effective measures should be formulated to strengthen the work of train operation safety and overcome negligence and paralysis of thought. The practice in recent months has proved that non-stop running through intermediate stations does not have any bad impact on the quality of locomotives, but this does not mean that crew members, dispatchers and other relevant personnel should not pay close attention to locomotive quality, fuel, water consumption and signal status. At present, some workers have developed negligent and paralyzed thoughts, and ignore the attention to these aspects, which is wrong. In the past six months, trains running non-stop through intermediate stations have had multiple accidents of water shortage and signal overrun, and individual locomotive crew members have risked refueling on the running board during operation, and some crew members do not carefully check before leaving the depot, do not fully prepare, and do not pay attention to summarizing the experience of operation after leaving the depot. These situations should attract the attention of all units, vigorously carry out education on train operation safety to the masses, help the masses earnestly promote various advanced experiences, strictly abide by rules and regulations, improve the vigilance of crew members and dispatchers, and eliminate all accidents.
    Finally, promoting this advanced experience should start from the actual effect to study specific conditions and overcome blindness. The practice in recent months has proved that this advanced experience can be promoted on both double-track and single-track lines. But in different situations, how to promote it, according to what policies, and what requirements to achieve in order to obtain the greatest economic effect, these issues are urgently needed by the leading organs to further study and solve. For example, in the case of balanced or unbalanced traffic flow in single-track sections, the effect of organizing non-stop running through intermediate stations is a problem worthy of research and comparison. Another example is that after organizing non-stop running through intermediate stations between Taolaishao and Changchun, and between Changchun and Siping, the Changchun Locomotive Depot cannot implement the locomotive cycle system. Which of these two economic effects is greater, and how to solve the contradiction between the two, these problems need to be solved.
    In short, non-stop running through intermediate stations has a great positive effect on further promoting the "full load, super-axle, five-hundred-kilometer movement," accelerating the turnover of locomotives and rolling stock, and increasing the passing capacity of sections. In order to give full play to these effects, it is necessary to clarify the purpose of promoting this experience and resolutely overcome the practice of creating "green street" for the sake of "green street" and sacrificing the running performance of other trains to create a "green street" typical example. Railway workers across the country should actively participate in this movement and push the "full load, super-axle, five-hundred-kilometer movement" to a new climax.

    正确地积极地推行中间站不停车运行 
    张攸民
    在哈尔滨铁路管理局的先进司机马玉谱、孙士贵和先进调度员徐克君、仉万俊等人的积极带头推行下，中间站不停车运行已成为全国铁路系统的群众性运动。在齐齐哈尔、吉林、锦州、北京、天津、济南、上海、柳州等铁路管理局，经过试点之后，也在深入推广中。推行这个经验的实践证明，这是一个挖掘潜力的有效方法。它减少了列车在给水站的作业时间、单线的会议时间、复线的越行待避时间和列车起停的附加时分，提高了列车的旅行速度，加速了机车、车辆的周转。它便于调整列车运行，减少单机，改进行车的组织工作。由于更充分地利用了惰力运行，它可以使机车节省大量燃料，并给超轴创造了更有利的条件。在这一经验成为群众性的实践以后，还可以节省给水站的费用。此外，它还可以缩短机车乘务员的劳动时间，提高机车乘务员的操纵技能和调度人员的指挥技能。
    正是这样，所以半年多以来，它已引起了各铁路局领导方面的重视，并采取了某些措施，使这一工作取得了显著的成绩。但是，也由于某些同志的思想认识不正确和组织工作上的某些缺点，致使上述这些作用还没有充分发挥出来。特别是对更好地解决邻区段机车和列车的衔接这一目的性不够明确，因此在加速机车车辆周转方面还没有获得应有的效果。为了进一步推行中间站不停车运行，充分发挥其作用，必须端正对这一工作的认识，并及时改正工作中的缺点。
    首先，在领导思想上应该明确推行中间站不停车运行，是“满载、超轴、五百公里运动”中的一个积极的措施。目前有些人把中间站不停车运行同“满载、超轴、五百公里运动”对立起来，忽视和放松了对“满载、超轴、五百公里运动”的领导，这是不对的。例如长春分局是哈尔滨铁路管理局中间站不停车运行次数最多的一个分局，但是四月份的日车公里没有完成。有些单位片面地总结由于开展了中间站不停车运行，缩短了车辆周转时间和超轴多少，过分夸大中间站不停车运行的作用，也是错误的，这就会削弱人们对“满载、超轴、五百公里运动”和行车组织工作的注意力，从而造成单纯追逐中间站不停车运行次数的现象。也有些同志看到了目前行车组织工作中的一些缺点，就对中间站不停车运行这一苏联先进经验发生怀疑，这也是不对的。不能只看到目前机车、列车在邻区段的衔接还不好，打乱运行图影响运行秩序，以及某些单位机车质量下降和产生了一些事故，就认为推行这一经验没有意义。应该积极地通过推行这一经验去改进行车组织工作，并在推行这一经验中挖掘潜在能力，为制定先进的运行图打下基础。不应该把目前行车组织工作中的某些缺点，当作怀疑或不推行这一先进经验的口实。
    其次，要加强中间站不停车运行的计划性，批判并克服那种不问经济效果的作法。现在有的单位里还有形式主义地推行和单纯追求运行次数的现象。有的只是根据途中运行情况，临时通知司机在中间站不停车。有的调度人员命令前行列车待避来造成后续列车中间站不停车的成绩，为了一个列车达到“绿街”（就是一路上都给列车可以通行的绿灯信号），不惜使更多列车遇到“红街”（不让列车通行的红灯信号）。有的甚至为了避免交会列车
  （在复线某些区段和单线区段）或由于前行列车影响，有的列车不按运行图规定的时分运转，调度人员临时给点，增加了运行时分。如哈尔滨机务段冖ㄢ一○五一号五月十一日在哈尔滨、安达间往返两次中间站不停车运行，但是当天的技术速度较计划还差一点三公里。至于中间站不停车运行的列车提早到达区段站后，列车不能迅速接运，机车不能迅速折返的现象更不是少见的事例。例如长春机务段七十号机车，牵引中间站不停车列车由长春到四平，途中运行仅用了两点四十八分，但到四平后机车白等了四点零二十七分。这些情况对于加速机车车辆周转不仅没有任何经济意义，而且造成了运行秩序的混乱。
    为了消灭这些不合理的现象，今后必须批判单纯追逐运行次数的本位主义思想，切实根据车流情况和两区段内运行列车的情况，有准备有计划地组织中间站不停车运行，将中间站不停车运行列入日班计划中去，以求得接续列车的衔接。同时要克服目前日班计划落后于实际的保守主义，应该进一步提高计划的水平，并同机车周转图很好地结合起来，这样才能充分发挥各方面的潜力，免使中间站不停车运行所获得的效果白白浪费。
    再次，应制定有效的措施，加强行车安全工作，克服疏忽大意和麻痹思想。几个月来的实践证明，中间站不停车运行对于机车质量并没有任何坏的影响，但是这并不是说乘务员、调度人员和其他有关人员就不应该密切注意机车质量、燃料、用水和信号状态等。目前，有的职工滋长了疏忽麻痹的思想，忽视对这些方面的注意，这是不对的。半年多来，中间站不停车运行的列车已发生过多次缺水和冒进信号的事故，还有个别机车乘务员在运行时冒险在走行板上注油，有的乘务员出乘前既不仔细检查，又不充分做好准备工作，出乘后则不注意总结运行的经验。这些情况应该引起各单位的注意，大力向群众进行行车安全的教育，帮助群众认真推行各种先进经验，严格遵守规章制度，提高乘务人员和调度人员的警惕性，消灭一切事故。
    最后，推行这一先进经验，应该从实际效果出发来研究具体条件，克服盲目性。半年多来的实践证明，无论是复线或单线都是可以推行这一先进经验的。但是在不同的情况下，应该如何推行，根据什么方针，达到什么要求，才能获得最大的经济效果，这些问题是急需领导机关进一步研究解决的。例如单线区段在车流平衡或者不平衡的情况下，组织中间站不停车运行的效果如何，便是一个值得研究比较的问题。又如陶赖昭和长春、长春和四平间组织中间站不停车运行后，长春机务段便无法实行机车循环运用制，这两种经济效果哪一种大，怎样解决两者之间的矛盾，这些问题都需要加以解决。
    总之，中间站不停车运行对于进一步推动“满载、超轴、五百公里运动”，加速机车车辆周转，提高区段通过能力有很大的积极作用。为了充分发挥这些作用，必须明确推行这一经验的目的性，坚决克服那种为“绿街”而“绿街”，牺牲别的列车运行成绩来创造“绿街”典型的作法。全国铁路职工应该积极地投入到这个运动中，把“满载、超轴、五百公里运动”推向新的高潮。
