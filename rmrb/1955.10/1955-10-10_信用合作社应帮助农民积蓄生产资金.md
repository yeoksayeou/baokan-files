Credit Cooperatives Should Help Farmers Accumulate Production Funds
　　Lu Hanchuan

Savings are a good thing to help farmers accumulate production funds, expand production in a planned way, and arrange their lives. After the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sales, farmers sold their agricultural products to the state in a concentrated manner in a short period after the harvest, thereby obtaining a large amount of currency. Some of this money will be used this year, but most of it should be saved for next year's spring plowing and production. Because some means of production do not need to be purchased temporarily, and some means of production are not yet supplied by the state. Therefore, in addition to purchasing the necessary means of production and daily necessities, farmers still have a large sum of cash on hand. How to arrange this money is a major issue. As the saying goes, "Money in hand, food to mouth," if this money is not properly arranged, it will cause waste and make production difficult next year. Only by depositing the money in banks or credit cooperatives can waste be avoided, and the money can be withdrawn next year during spring plowing to purchase means of production to develop production. In the past two years, many farmers have actively participated in savings. During last year's unified grain purchase period, the People's Bank of China absorbed more than 470 million yuan in farmer savings (including the portion of farmer savings absorbed by credit cooperatives and then re-deposited in banks); they were successively withdrawn during this year's spring plowing and production for use in production. This has helped farmers arrange production in a planned way, overcome waste, and avoid excessive tension in the state's supply of materials during the peak season, which is beneficial to both the state and the farmers.

This year's agricultural harvest is abundant, farmers' incomes have increased, and farmers have obtained a large sum of cash after selling their agricultural products to the state in a concentrated manner. However, there are still many farmers who have not developed the habit of saving. Some farmers believe that it doesn't matter if they spend more money after a good harvest and that they don't need to save. It must be estimated that agricultural production cooperatives will develop greatly next year. Agricultural production cooperatives need a lot of funds to increase equipment and expand production. The state will certainly provide strong assistance, but farmers themselves must also work hard to save. Therefore, farmers should be educated to actively participate in savings and prepare funds for next year's production. This is also one of the important preparations for vigorously developing the agricultural cooperativization movement next year.

In the past, some farmers were far away from bank business offices, and it was not very convenient to deposit and withdraw money. This year, there are more than 150,000 credit cooperatives across the country. Most areas have cooperatives in every township, and it will be more convenient for farmers to deposit and withdraw money in credit cooperatives. After this year's rectification, credit cooperatives have established regular and close ties with the broad masses of farmers and are fully capable of helping farmers do a good job in savings. Therefore, rural savings this year are handled by credit cooperatives, and the state bank no longer handles preferential grain sales savings. For credit cooperatives, doing a good job in rural savings during the peak season is a new and arduous task. They should have an in-depth understanding of farmers' income and expenditure, educate members and the broad masses of farmers to actively participate in savings; at the same time, they should improve the system, simplify procedures, facilitate farmer savings, and strictly prevent the occurrence of coercive orders.

Some credit cooperatives still lack experience in rural savings work. Therefore, local banks should strengthen their business leadership over credit cooperatives, assist credit cooperatives in doing a good job in savings, manage accounts well, prevent confusion, and urge credit cooperatives to deposit surplus funds in banks to prevent misuse, so as to avoid payment difficulties next year. Some bank staff think that after rural savings are handled by credit cooperatives, the bank can ignore them, which is wrong.

The peak season has arrived, and credit cooperatives and banks should, under the leadership and support of the Party committees and people's committees, seize the opportunity to carry out publicity and education among farmers and mobilize the broad masses of farmers to actively participate in savings.

    信用合作社应帮助农民积蓄生产资金
    卢汉川
    储蓄是帮助农民积蓄生产资金有计划地扩大生产和安排生活的一件好事。国家实行统购统销政策以后，农民在收获后的短时期内要把农产品集中地卖给国家，从而取得了大量货币。在这些货币中，有一部分是今年就要用的，但大部分都应该留到明年春耕生产时才用。因为有些生产资料暂时不需要购买，有些生产资料国家暂时还不供应。所以农民除了购买目前必需的生产资料和生活用品外，手中还有一大笔现款。如何安排这笔钱是一件大事。俗语说“钱到手、饭到嘴”，如果这笔钱安排得不当，就会造成浪费，使明年生产发生困难。只有把钱存在银行或信用合作社里，才能避免浪费，等明年春耕生产时取出来购买生产资料，以发展生产。两年来，许多农民是踊跃参加储蓄的。去年粮食统购期间，中国人民银行吸收的农民储蓄就有四亿七千多万元（包括信用合作社吸收农民储蓄又转存银行的部分）；今年春耕生产时又陆续取回用于生产。这样既帮助农民有计划地安排生产，克服浪费，也避免了旺季国家物资供应过于紧张，对国家对农民都是有利的。
    今年农产品丰收，农民收入增加，农民把农产品集中地卖给国家后，已取得了大笔现款。但是，目前还有不少农民没有养成节约储蓄的习惯，有些农民认为丰收后多花费些钱不算什么，不必储蓄。必须估计到明年农业生产合作社将有大量发展，农业生产合作社增加设备扩大生产，需要很多的资金，国家固然要给以大力的帮助，但农民自己也要努力节约积蓄。因此应当教育农民踊跃储蓄，为明年生产准备资金，这也是明年大力发展农业合作化运动的重要准备工作之一。
    过去有些农民离银行营业所较远，存款、取款都不大方便，今年全国信用合作社已有十五万多个，大部分地区乡乡有社，农民在信用合作社存款和取款将更加方便。信用合作社经过了今年的整顿，同广大农民建立了经常的密切的联系，完全有可能帮助农民办好储蓄。所以今年农村储蓄都由信用合作社办理，国家银行不再办理优待售粮储蓄。对信用合作社来说，办好旺季的农村储蓄工作，是一件新的艰巨的任务，应当深入了解农民收入和用款情况，教育社员和广大农民积极参加储蓄；同时要改善制度，简化手续，便利农民储蓄，严格防止发生强迫命令现象。
    有些信用合作社还缺乏农村储蓄工作经验，因此，各地银行要加强对信用合作社的业务领导，协助信用合作社办好储蓄，搞好账务，防止错乱，督促信用社把多余的资金转存银行，防止乱用，以免造成明年支付的困难。有些银行工作人员以为农村储蓄由信用合作社办理后，银行就可以不管了，这是不对的。
    旺季已经到来，信用合作社和银行应当在党委和人民委员会领导和支持下，抓紧向农民进行宣传教育，动员广大农民踊跃参加储蓄。
