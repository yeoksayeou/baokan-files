    What is Liang Shuming's so-called "Reason"?
    Wang Ruoshui
    In Liang Shuming's later two works – "The Theory of Rural Construction" and "The Essentials of Chinese Culture" – there is a term used most frequently, and that is "reason." In "The Essentials of Chinese Culture," Liang Shuming himself said that "reason" is "the most important concept in this book." He elaborated a whole set of theories centered on this concept. Liang Shuming announced that "the Chinese national spirit is rational throughout" ("Liang Shuming Education Essays," p. 92), and that whether it is "the guidance of a reasonable attitude towards life, the discussion of practical life issues, or the analysis of historical culture," it should all be centered on this Chinese national spirit – "reason" (ibid.). In the book "The Essentials of Chinese Culture," what Liang Shuming attempts to explain is also such a question. In his view, Chinese culture has an "incomparably great power," which is difficult to grasp, making foreigners feel it is an "unsolvable mystery," and also making Liang Shuming exclaim "Strange! Strange!" But we should thank Liang Shuming. After forty years of life experience and hundreds of thousands of words of hard argumentation, he pointed out this power to us: it turns out that "this is the power of reason." "Reason" is the characteristic and strength of Chinese culture. "The greatness of China is nothing but the greatness of human reason." Liang Shuming in "The Theory of Rural Construction" also repeatedly emphasizes this thing, telling us that "to understand Chinese culture in the past and the future of China, we must first understand this thing – reason" (p. 39).
    Similarly, we say that to understand Liang Shuming's reactionary thought, we must also understand his so-called "reason."
    I
    "Reason" is a solemn term, and materialists respect reason. However, we also know that this term has been given various different meanings by idealists. For example, Kant has his "reason," and Hegel also has his "reason." What is Liang Shuming's "reason"? We still have to listen to his own explanation first.
    According to Liang Shuming, there are two different kinds of "reason," one is "physical reason" and the other is "emotional reason." The "reason" of "physical reason" is the reason of science, the reason of logic; what French rationalists talk about is this "reason." The "reason" of "emotional reason" is the "reason" that Chinese people talk about, which "indicates the direction of people's behavior" and "tells you what you should do," such as "fatherly kindness and filial piety." This is "Chinese-style rationalism." ("Theory," p. 132) Corresponding to these two kinds of "reason," there are also two aspects to the workings of the human mind: "the intellectual aspect is called intellect; the emotional aspect is called reason" ("Essentials," p. 138). "Discerning physical reason relies on intellect, understanding emotional reason relies on reason." ("Theory," pp. 43-44)
    We can see that the "reason" of "emotional reason" that Liang Shuming speaks of is also the "reason" of "ethics." Therefore, his so-called "reason" refers to a kind of moral consciousness. Liang Shuming himself said very clearly: "Morality is a matter of reason" ("Essentials," p. 115), "The so-called reason is nothing more than the ethical sentiments of fatherly kindness and filial piety, and the upward striving of a life of goodness and repentance." ("Theory," p. 44)
    We must pay special attention to the fact that Liang Shuming's "reason" belongs to the emotional aspect and is opposed to intellect. The opposition between them comes from the opposition between "emotional reason" and "physical reason": "Emotional reason comes from human emotions and preferences, leaning towards the subjective; physical reason exists in things, coming from human examination, leaning towards the objective." ("Theory," p. 43) So, what is the relationship between "reason" and intellect? Liang Shuming said: "Strictly speaking, only reason is the master; intellect, instinct, and habit are all tools." ("Essentials," p. 349)
    In this way, Liang Shuming expelled intellect from the realm of morality and placed the former under the independent rule of emotion. For Liang Shuming, objective intellect is not qualified to examine "subjective" "reason" – moral emotion. On the contrary, subjective moral emotion should dominate objective intellect. This "reason," which possesses supreme authority, is actually something non-intellectual and supra-intellectual. Obviously, Liang Shuming's "reason" is not true reason (because reason and intellect are the same thing, and there is no supra-intellectual reason), but an anti-rational imposter. – Liang Shuming is actually insulting the solemn term "reason."
    Reason, according to a correct understanding, is the human ability to use concepts to make judgments and inferences, that is, the ability of logical thinking. Marxists believe that only by relying on reason can people understand the essence and laws of the objective world on the basis of sensory experience, and only by understanding the essence and laws of the objective world can people correctly guide their behavior. Therefore, reason is not only applicable to the natural realm but also to the social and moral realm. Moral concepts are certainly subjective things, but their roots are objective material living conditions. For a moral concept, one should not accept it solely based on emotion, but should examine it through reason, judging whether it is reasonable and whether it should be followed. We acknowledge the importance of emotion. However, excluding the guidance of reason or intellect, emotion becomes a subjective and blind force, which cannot enable people to act correctly. Therefore, emotion must be judged by reason as to whether it is correct. Only in this way is true respect for reason. Liang Shuming limits the scope of intellectual activity and makes intellect a servant and tool of emotion, which only exposes that he is an enemy of reason.
    We must now offend the dignity of this "reason's" master, and use the "tool" of intellect to examine it.
    According to Liang Shuming, this kind of "reason" is inherent in everyone from birth. "Ethics starts from emotion and originally belongs to morality; it is originally in people's own hearts, not added from external legal force." ("Liang Shuming's Educational Writings") "Emotional reason is in people's hearts" ("Essentials," p. 127), "People of the past, people of the present, and people of the future are all people; being able to recognize this human spirit (reason) will never be defeated." ("Liang Shuming's Educational Writings") That is to say, "reason" is innate, it is originally in people's hearts, and everyone can act according to the command of this "reason" in their hearts. Therefore, the source of moral concepts and the standard of morality are not objective but in people's hearts.
    In this way, Liang Shuming's starting point is the human heart. This "human" should not be the concrete, real human, but the abstract, general human; it should not belong to any era or any class, but only a hollow concept of "human." The matter is very clear: as long as we talk about the historical class of people, we cannot find common moral concepts among them. Engels once pointed out in "Anti-Dühring" that the concepts of good and evil are changing; feudal aristocrats, the bourgeoisie, and the proletariat each have their own special morality. Now that Liang Shuming declares that he has found such a universal human morality, we would like to know its content. Regarding this, Liang Shuming talks a great deal in each of his books. We can flip through a few pages at random and see his set of moral teachings: what "fatherly kindness and filial piety," what "keeping to one's place," "being content with one's lot," what "harmonizing and compromising, passively restraining," "being self-denying, yielding to others, learning to take losses," what "loyalty, filial piety, harmony, each fulfilling their duty, and never rebelling"...
    At a glance, it can be seen that this is not the "reason" possessed by "people of the past, people of the present, and people of the future," but only the moral concepts of the Chinese feudal era. Those who advocate this "reason" are not "humanity," but only the feudal class and their slaves. Liang Shuming has not discovered what he thought he discovered; he is only impersonating the feudal morality standards as the common moral standards of all eras, and disguising a feudal lackey as the general "human" who is the same as everyone else.
    This set of moral norms must take a specific society – the economic and political system of feudal society – as a prerequisite. In this society, landlords and aristocrats cruelly exploit peasants, and the emperor is the highest representative of the feudal class; the entire society establishes a set of hierarchical systems according to the principle of patriarchal clan, and the emperor has absolute authority over the people, and the parents have absolute authority over their children. In this society, since the feudal class occupies a ruling position economically and politically, they also use their moral concepts to rule people's thoughts. They declare patience and obedience as virtues, precisely because their oppression and rule make the people unable to bear it. They preach "contentment" to the peasants, precisely because the peasants have been exploited by them and have nothing left. They praise "keeping to one's place," because the emperor no longer has the problem of "keeping to one's place," but needs to make the oppressed content with their status as slaves. As for "loyalty and filial piety," it is to demand absolute obedience to the authority of this patriarchal system, the so-called "the ruler is the guide of the subject," the so-called "there are no wrong parents in the world." – This is the class essence of the set of moral norms that Liang Shuming burns incense and worships.
    Liang Shuming believes that this "reason" produced ancient society, but in fact, his "reason" is precisely a product of the economic base of feudal society. The West also had this kind of feudal moral concepts in the feudal era, but this concept later lost its ruling position and was replaced by the moral concepts of the bourgeoisie. Capitalist large-scale industry destroyed the feudal economic base, and also destroyed the patriarchal system and ethical relations built on this base. Marx and Engels described this process in the "Communist Manifesto":
     The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has
    put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has
    pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man
    to his “natural superiors,” and has left remaining no other nexus
    between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous
    “cash payment.” ...
     The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation
    hitherto honoured and looked up to with reverent awe. It has
    converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man
    of science, into its paid wage labourers.
     The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental
    veil, and has reduced the family relation to a mere money
    relation.
    Although Liang Shuming tries his best to portray feudal ethics and morality as "human reason," he cannot deny the fact that the bourgeoisie, although also human beings, do not respect this "reason." Regarding this point, Liang Shuming can only say that this is the difference between Chinese and Western cultures – the Chinese (actually feudal society) have "early enlightenment of reason," while Westerners (actually capitalist society) have "undeveloped reason." As for further questions: Why is there this difference? Liang Shuming has never given us a satisfactory answer.
    To truly explain the different moral concepts and emotions possessed by different people, it is only possible to study the objective social causes that produce them. Moral concepts do not fall from the sky, and "human emotions and preferences" are not without reason. The feudal class, the bourgeoisie, and the proletariat each have their own morality, and each have their own loves and hates, because they each have different class positions. Liang Shuming's announcement of the corrupt feudal moral dogmas as "human reason" is only to idealize feudal society and to reverse the course of history.
    But the feudal social system has fully exposed its irrationality, and the term "reason" cannot rationalize it. On the Chinese mainland, the feudal class has been eliminated, and the rule of feudalism is gone forever. No matter how Liang Shuming sings loudly about "reason," he cannot recall the souls of the dead class. The feudal moral consciousness is being eliminated, because what it reflects, its foundation, no longer exists. However, "consciousness lags behind existence," and it will not disappear quickly. Representatives of the reactionary class will still desperately cling to it, and Liang Shuming is one of them.
    Marxists fundamentally do not recognize the existence of supra-class morality in class society, and of course deny that a certain kind of morality that reflects the interests of the exploiting class can become the eternal "reason" of mankind. Marxists openly point out the class nature of morality, and at the same time resolutely break off relations with all the hypocritical morality of the past exploiting classes, and establish the moral concepts of their own class – communist morality. Only this kind of morality is truly the highest morality. This morality requires people to consciously abide by it, so it does not want people to blind their intellect, but wants people to develop their intellect. Only by relying on intellect, understanding the laws of social life, and cultivating love for the motherland, the people, and labor in this process, will people consciously abide by this morality. This new type of morality has unlimited prospects, and in the future socialist and communist society, after the elimination of classes, it will become the morality of the whole people.
    II
    According to Liang Shuming, on the basis of this "reason," the ancient Chinese established a "society based on ethics," and "an ethical society is a society that values emotion" ("Essentials," p. 96), "Ethical relations are emotional relations" (ibid., p. 150). In this way, he reached an idealistic conclusion: the basic relationship between people is not an economic relationship, but a relationship between hearts, a relationship of emotions. – According to Liang Shuming, this is "reason." In this way, Liang Shuming turned the real economic and political problems into psychological problems: "The so-called problem of people to people is actually the problem of heart to heart; the mutual appeal between them all relies on the sincerity to move. This is precisely reason in a narrow sense; this is also the purest effort inward." ("Essentials," pp. 293-294)
    Is there a "relationship of emotion" between people? Of course there is. But in addition to the relationship of emotion, there is also an antagonistic relationship between people; in addition to the relationship of hearts, there are also material relations, relations in the production process, and in class society, this is mainly the relationship of exploitation and being exploited, the relationship of ruling and being ruled. Economic relations are the basis of all other human relationships, including "emotional relationships" or "ethical relationships." The oppressed class has class feelings for each other because of their common position and destiny; there is also emotion between the oppressors when their interests are consistent. But if it is said that there is also a universal "relationship of emotion" between the oppressors and the oppressed, it is to obliterate the bloody facts of class struggle, which is deception. Not only that, but there is not always emotion between the rulers. "A history of the Twenty-Four Dynasties is a book of mutual slashing." Who is slashing whom? Landlords want to suppress peasants, and peasants want to resist landlords, so they slash each other; rulers want to fight for power and profit, and compete to be emperors, so they also slash each other. In a society of class confrontation, the exploiting class builds its own happiness on the backs of the exploited class, which is the fundamental reason why there cannot be universal emotion in class society.
    So here there are two viewpoints, and from these two viewpoints, two ways of doing things are produced:
    Our viewpoint and approach: As long as private ownership exists, as long as the fact of class exploitation exists, there will be no emotion between all people; between the exploiters and the exploited, the real problem is definitely not a "heart-to-heart problem," but the economic problem of slavery, the political problem of oppression. For example, the greed, cruelty, and tyranny of the landlord class are determined by their class position as feudal exploiters, and the hatred of the peasants for the landlords is also the inevitable result of the economic fact that the peasants are exploited by the landlords. Therefore, to eliminate the conflict between people forever, it is only possible to rely on class struggle, using the means of class struggle to overthrow the exploiters and to abolish the system of private property.
    Liang Shuming's viewpoint and approach: The relationship between hearts determines other relationships, and the fundamental problem lies not in the actual economic and political system but in the human heart. Therefore, the solution is not class struggle, not revolution, but "putting effort inward," but relying on "reason."
    So Liang Shuming used a "veil of warmth and affection" to cover up the facts of cold class oppression, and tried his best to praise what he called the "reason" of the ancient Chinese. This "reason" is also the second fundamental attitude towards life that Liang Shuming said in "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," that is, "to harmonize the will for oneself, and take moderation as its fundamental spirit." It is said that this is the "spirit" of Chinese culture. The main content of "reason" is "putting effort inward," that is, "selflessness," "non-contention," "harmony," "self-denial," etc.: – The choices of reason vary, but they should be centered on selfless feelings. ("Essentials," p. 138) The ancient Chinese had insight into the harmony of human life. – A person is harmonious in himself, people are harmonious with each other, and the entire universe centered on man is harmonious... This point of harmony is the clear and peaceful mind, that is, reason. (Ibid., pp. 144-145) The meaning of ethics is to value the other party; almost abandoning one's own position and taking the other party's position as one's own... I have never heard of taking struggle as the way, but there is another set of philosophy of self-denial, yielding to others, and learning to take losses. ("Reply to Criticism of Rural Construction") He (Confucius) makes you happy without gaining anything, not satisfied with gaining something; he makes you forget things, forget yourself, and forget everything, not make you distinguish between things and yourself and pursue them. ("The Final Awakening of the Chinese National Self-Salvation Movement," p. 68) Let us try to translate these words according to their essential meaning, which is this: You must give up your own interests and endure the exploitation of the landlords, otherwise you are not taking "reason" as the choice, you are a selfish person; you must forget the opposition between the reactionary rulers and the people, and see the "harmony" between them, otherwise, you will lose the "clear and peaceful mind," that is, lose "reason"; you must respect the enemy, give up your own position and stand in his position, yield to him, and learn to take losses; not only that, but after you give up all this, you should also feel very happy, because you have "forgotten things, forgotten yourself, and forgotten everything," and you are already the most "reasonable" person.
    Such a person who is most "reasonable" in Liang Shuming's eyes is none other than a docile slave who has lost the minimum human dignity and has no spirit of blood. This slave does not need physical shackles, because his heart has already been shackled. This is what Liang Shuming said that "reason" is in people's hearts and does not need to be "added by external legal force"; indeed, this spiritual shackle is much stronger than legal shackles.
    Liang Shuming believes that although "reason" is inherent in everyone, only one kind of person is qualified to represent it, and that is the "scholar" of Chinese feudal society: "Scholars do not engage in production, but they have a great function in society; that is, they represent reason, preside over education, and maintain order" ("Theory," p. 43). The role of scholars is to "work on both sides" for the emperor and the people:
      On the side of the monarch, the more he uses force, the less
    stable he is; it is better to use warmth, promote education, and
    show reason to people.
    On the side of the people, what they need is encouragement of
    diligence and frugality and the strengthening of friendship... At
    this time, it is only by relying on scholars, on the one hand, to
    constantly remind and advise the monarch, ... and on the other
    hand, to constantly teach the common people to be loyal, filial,
    harmonious, each fulfilling their duty, and never rebelling. In
    this way, the needs of both parties are met and their conflicts
    are eased. Otherwise, if the monarch gets angry, the common
    people will not be able to bear it; if the common people rise up
    and rebel, it will be easy. (Ibid., p. 45)
    Liang Shuming describes this kind of "scholar" as a truly impartial third party, but in fact, this kind of person serves the emperor, because their "work" is precisely to consolidate this feudal order, to make the emperor's throne "stable," and to make the common people not "rebel."
    Liang Shuming himself is also this kind of "scholar," a modern Chinese royalist and defender of the way. He represents "reason" to "bestow warmth and promote education" to the people, teaching us to "never rebel." Liang Shuming said that he wants to establish a new social organization, "This social organization is based on ethical emotion, with the aim of upward striving in life, ... this is purely a rational organization, which fully embodies the spirit (reason) of mankind" (ibid., p. 175). Liang Shuming believes that this kind of organization should start from the countryside, so he calls it "Rural Agricultural School." Of course, this kind of organization is not purely a Chinese product. It "absorbs the strengths of Westerners," that is, the so-called "strengths" of capitalist political organizations. In the "Rural Agricultural School," there is also someone who "represents reason," that is, the principal, also known as the school chief, who is also the village chief. Since this school chief represents "reason," "he must supervise and teach everyone" (ibid., p. 247), and "everyone must accept the school chief's scolding" (ibid., p. 251). Needless to say, his purpose is also to make the peasants "never rebel."
    Liang Shuming's so-called "Rural Construction Movement" is based on this so-called "Chinese-style rationalism" as its theoretical foundation. Liang Shuming said: "Chinese ethics extends the feelings of family to all social relations, clearly showing the meaning of mutual regard for each other, always preventing it from becoming an opposition." ("Essentials," p. 226) Liang Shuming himself is also promoting "reason" in this way, always trying to prevent peasants and landlords, the people and the reactionary rulers from "becoming opposed," to make the oppressed tamely endure exploitation without any resistance. Liang Shuming said that he opposes the peasant movement led by the Communist Party, because this kind of "peasant movement first makes a kind of differentiation effort in rural society, making rural society become a situation of separation and confrontation, and struggle occurs within rural society" ("Essays," p. 140). As for Liang Shuming, what he is doing is not a "peasant movement" but a "rural movement," that is, not distinguishing between landlords and peasants, but "seeing the countryside as a whole" (ibid.), and the problems of the countryside "must avoid struggle as much as possible and seek solutions from reason" ("Theory," p. 282). In other words, it is to obliterate class contradictions, to make the peasants give up struggle, to "harmonize" with the landlords, and to unite as "one body." Then the reactionary ruling class's regime will be firmly established, and they can sleep peacefully. This is called "peace in the world":
      The content of peace in the world is that everyone in ethical
    relations does their best (the so-called father is a father, son is
    a son), everyone protects each other in peace, raises the living
    and buries the dead without regret. ("Essentials," p. 91)
    Liang Shuming's "rationalism" is such a spiritual weapon that suppresses the people and opposes revolution. This weapon is not as easy to arouse people's resistance as a bayonet. It does soft work, is a "battle for hearts," and wants to disarm us. Therefore, Liang Shuming's method is even more clever and vicious!
    Wielding this weapon, Liang Shuming shouted against the Communist Party and against violent revolution. He said, "Force is something that hinders reason" ("Reply to Criticism of Rural Construction"). During the Liberation War, he equated Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war with the people's revolution, expressing his attitude: "For any topic of violent revolution, or any topic of internal war, I do not recognize it and oppose it to the end." ("Establish Credit, Strive for Cooperation") He wrote an article "Respectfully Advise the Chinese Communist Party" in February 1949, when the country was about to be liberated, which said: "I have always disapproved of the CCP's abuse of force." "Force and democracy are incompatible; there will be no democracy under the unification of force." "I solemnly request the Chinese Communist Party that you must allow the existence of all dissidents." That is to say, our use of armed revolution to overthrow the Kuomintang's armed counter-revolution is not "democratic" and does not speak of "reason"; to speak of "democracy" and "reason," we must allow the anti-democratic Kuomintang reactionaries to exist. – It is self-evident to whom Liang Shuming's "reason" is ultimately beneficial.
    There is no doubt that if this "theory" is applied to the current problems, it means that we should not eliminate counter-revolutionaries, should not conduct a struggle against the bourgeoisie, and should not carry out a socialist revolution.
    The Chinese Communist Party did not accept Liang Shuming's so-called "respectful advice." It ignored this set of fallacies and executed the will of the people, resolutely carrying the revolution to the end. The people's democracy and the dictatorship over the reactionaries are two inseparable aspects – without the latter, there is no former. Force, as long as it comes from the will of the people, as long as it is used against the reactionaries, will never hinder democracy, but will only guarantee democracy. History has proven that no reactionary class will automatically withdraw from the stage of history, so the people must use force to overthrow them, and after overthrowing them, they must also use force to suppress their resistance. Class struggle is not a matter of who likes it or dislikes it. It is the law of history. To sing loudly about universal "harmony" in class society is to lie with one's eyes closed. Only in the future socialist communist society, in the world of great harmony, can the material source of conflict between people be fundamentally eliminated, can there be a universal close relationship between people – the comradely mutual assistance and cooperation of the whole society.
    III
    In order to thoroughly liquidate this fallacy of "rationalism," we must further criticize the foundation of its worldview. This worldview says that the universe itself is a large life, and that human life is connected with this "universe large life" – the so-called "human life is connected with all things in heaven and earth without separation" ("Essentials," p. 149). Therefore, the "reason" of the "universe large life" is also connected with human psychology. Not only that, but the latter is the highest expression of the former. People can recognize their own lives and the lives of others by virtue of the "reason" in their hearts, and can also recognize the entire "universe large life," thereby reaching the mysterious realm of "the integration of self and others" and "the unity of heaven and man."
      What is called nature? What is called rational? Nature is
    rational; rational is in accordance with the reason of nature. This
    is one sentence, not two sentences. So, what does nature refer
    to? Nature refers to the universe large life; the reason of nature
    is the most vibrant part of the universe large life – human
    psychology. The vitality of the universe large life is only
    entrusted to mankind; apart from mankind, it can no longer
    express the vitality of the universe large life. The so-called
    rational, in essence, is in accordance with the requirements of
    human psychology. This requirement follows the life of the
    universe and is natural. Its strongest requirement is the highest
    point of activity of the universe large life. I often like to say that
    "reason" is this. To sum up, we must recognize mankind,
    recognize the special (reason) of human life; by recognizing this,
    we also know the basis of so-called natural rationality. ("Theory,"
    p. 454)
    This passage expresses Liang Shuming's philosophy very clearly. According to this philosophy, not only do people have life, but also mountains, rivers, land, sun, moon, and stars all have life. And all these lives, from grains of sand to the sun, from the earth under our feet to nebulae hundreds of millions of light-years away, must obey the requirements of Liang Shuming's psychology (which Liang Shuming calls "the requirements of human psychology"), and must revolve around this "reason" in Liang Shuming's heart. – If they do not listen, then it is "unreasonable." The order of morality becomes the law of nature, and the norms of human affairs become the laws of the universe. – In this way, Liang Shuming completed his idealistic system, holding his "reason" to a supreme and sacred position, while also pushing his idealistic philosophy to the apex of absurdity.
    This philosophy has its ideological origins. Liang Shuming only affixed the trademark of "reason" without creating any new products. This philosophy is a combination of the feudal Confucian philosophy of the Wang Yangming school and the vitalism philosophy of the declining period of Western capitalism of the Bergson school.
    Wang Yangming was a subjective idealist, who said: "A man is the heart of heaven and earth; heaven, earth, and all things are originally one with me." ("The Complete Works of Wang Wencheng," the same below) "Heaven, earth, and all things are originally one with man, and the most refined place where they open up is the point of spiritual brightness in the human heart." (In Liang Shuming's words, the most vibrant part of the universe large life is human psychology.) Wang Yangming denied that there are matter and objective laws that exist independently of human consciousness, believing that the "reason" of all things is originally in people's hearts. Therefore, the problem of knowledge is not to reflect the external world as it is, but to return to one's own heart and discover that "reason" from within. He called this "innate knowledge." "The innate knowledge of my heart is what is called heavenly reason." Innate knowledge and heavenly reason are the same thing, and heavenly reason is the norm of morality: "Etiquette is heavenly reason." "The character for etiquette is the character for reason." (This "reason" of "heavenly reason" is also the "reason" of Liang Shuming's "emotional reason," the "reason" of "reason.") This innate knowledge is unchanging, innate, and rules the universe: "The innate knowledge in people's hearts is the same throughout the ages and fills the universe... It is innate and does not violate heaven." This innate knowledge is also something non-rational. It is the innate knowledge of "knowing without thinking" mentioned by Mencius. It is also only a subjective emotion of good and bad: "Innate knowledge is just a heart of right and wrong, and right and wrong is just a matter of good and bad."
    In addition to inheriting this idea, Liang Shuming also accepted Bergson's philosophy. Bergson was an imperialist bourgeois philosopher, a mystic, and a representative of vitalist philosophy. His philosophy is notorious for being anti-rational and anti-scientific. Bergson reversed all scientific conclusions by one hundred and eighty degrees, declaring that the origin of the universe is life, and the evolution of the universe is the impulse of the flow of life. This mysterious "élan vital" resists the resistance of matter and develops as a result to become organisms, and progresses farthest in a certain place, which is man. (This is also what Liang Shuming said that human psychology is the most vibrant place in the large life of the universe.) Bergson said in one of his main works, "Creative Evolution," that the flow of life is the "great heart," and that "the heart of each organism is a branch of the great heart" (according to Zhang Dongsheng's translation, the same below). Therefore, "we are really one with the entire universe."
    But how can we recognize the "noumenon" of life and reach the realm of "being one with the entire universe"? Bergson said that this cannot be done by intellect, because intellect can only recognize the surface of things; to recognize the noumenon of life, one must rely on a mysterious "intuition." The position of intuition is above intellect: "Intuition is closer to life than intellect" ("Mind-Energy," Hu Guoyu's translation), "Intuition is really beyond wisdom" ("Creative Evolution"). Bergson also divided "reason" into two types. He called the objective material law in science "geometric reason," and called the "reason" related to spirit, such as morality and art, "living reason" or "intentional reason" (Liang Shuming's "physical reason" and "emotional reason" come from here). This latter kind of "reason" is fundamental, and science cannot recognize it, only intuition can recognize it. In this way, Bergson openly expressed his hatred for science and intellect.
    Liang Shuming's "reason" is basically (basically speaking, because there are other sources, such as Russell) a combination of Wang Yangming's "innate knowledge" and Bergson's "intuition."
    If we look at Liang Shuming's early work, "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies," we can find that it rarely talks about "reason." Even when it does talk about it, it adopts a rejecting attitude. What this book talks about a lot is "intuition." He praised that Confucius was an intuitionist. "Ordinary people want to be reasonable, but Confucius is unreasonable; ordinary people seek to be clear, but Confucius is simply unclear! However, as a result, the clarity of ordinary people becomes unclear, and the unclearness of Confucius reaches the extreme of clarity. Confucius always relies on his intuition... Our behavior and actions are actually dominated by our intuition, and intellect does not dominate him" (p. 124). He clearly linked the Confucian "innate knowledge" with Bergson's "intuition": "The innate knowledge of knowing without thinking, and the innate ability of being able to do without learning, we call intuition today." (p. 125) This intuition and innate knowledge are opposed to intellect, so Liang Shuming tells people to reject intellect and tells people to be "unreasonable": "What is feared is that intellect comes out to distinguish between things and self, and to weigh and calculate, so that intuition retreats and becomes unkind." (p. 128)
    But Bergson's "intuition" is instinct. Liang Shuming later felt that this statement did not show the idea of "transcending things," and instinct was also somewhat indistinguishable from the so-called "selfish desires" that he opposed. So he found a new name: reason. From then on, he also wanted to "be reasonable," and according to him, Confucius had always been "reasonable." Of course, as mentioned earlier, this "reason" is not the reason of science and the reason of intellect. His "reason" belongs to the emotional aspect, and Liang Shuming said that "all emotions belong to intuition" ("Philosophy," p. 102). From this, it can be seen that his so-called "rationalism" is none other than anti-rationalism.
    This anti-rationalism is also a kind of mysticism. Liang Shuming tells us that by developing this "reason," we can reach a supreme transcendent state, in which all opposition between people, between people and nature, disappears, and "I" also disappears: "At this time, a piece of heavenly reason is flowing, and there is no view of the other or me, which is called 'no opposition'; expressed in consciousness, it is reason." ("Essentials," p. 293)
    Perhaps some people can reach this mysterious state of "no opposition," but not in real life, but in his own hallucinations. He can consider himself to

    梁漱溟所谓“理性”是什么？
    王若水
    在梁漱溟的较后的两本著作——“乡村建设理论”和“中国文化要义”里，有一个用得最多的名词，那就是“理性”。在“中国文化要义”里，梁漱溟自己说，“理性”这个东西，“将是本书一最重要的观念”。以这个观念为中心，他发挥了一整套理论。梁漱溟宣布说，“中国民族精神彻头彻尾都是理性的发挥”（“梁漱溟教育论文集”，页九二），而无论是“合理人生态度的指点，人生实际问题的讨论，乃至历史文化的分析”，都要以这个中国民族精神——“理性”为核心（同上）。在“中国文化要义”这本书里，梁漱溟所企图说明的也是这样一个问题。据他看来，中国文化有一种“无比之伟大力量”，这种力量很难捉摸，使外国人觉得是“不可解之谜”，也使得梁漱溟惊呼“怪哉！怪哉！” 但是我们应当感谢梁漱溟，经过他四十年的生活体验和几十万字的辛苦论证，他把这个力量给我们指明了：原来“这就是理性之力”。“理性”是中国文化的特点和长处所在，“中国的伟大非他，原只是人类理性的伟大”。梁漱溟在“乡村建设理论”里也反复强调这个东西，他告诉我们，“想明白中国过去的文化，及中国未来的前途，都要先明白这个东西——理性”（页三九）。
    同样，我们说，要想明白梁漱溟的反动思想，也必须明白他所谓的“理性”。
    一
    “理性”，这是一个庄严的名词，唯物论者是尊重理性的。不过我们同时也知道，这个名词曾被唯心论者赋予各种不同的内容，例如康德有他的“理性”，黑格尔也有他的“理性”。梁漱溟的“理性”是什么，我们还得先听听他自己的解释。
    据梁漱溟看来，有两种不同的“理”，一种是“物理”，一种是“情理”。“物理”的“理”就是科学的理，逻辑的理；法国理性主义者讲的就是这个“理”。“情理”的“理”是中国人讲的“理”，它是“指示人们行为的动向”的，是“告诉你是应当如何如何”的，例如“父慈子孝”之类。这是“中国式的理性主义”。（“理论”，页一三二）与这两种“理”相应，人的心思作用也有两面：“知的一面曰理智；情的一面曰理性”（“要义”，页一三八）。“辨察物理靠理智，体认情理靠理性。”（“理论”，页四三—四四）
    我们可以看出，梁漱溟所说的“情理”的“理”，也就是“伦理”的“理”，因此他所谓“理性”是指的一种道德意识。梁漱溟自己说得很清楚：“道德为理性之事”（“要义”，页一一五），“所谓理性，要无外父慈子孝的伦理情谊，和好善改过的人生向上。”（“理论”，页四四）
    我们要特别注意梁漱溟的“理性”是属于感情方面的，是和理智对立的。它们之间的对立来源于“情理”和“物理”的对立：“情理出于人情好恶，偏于主观；物理存于事物，经人考验而来，偏于客观。”（“理论”，页四三）那么，“理性”和理智的关系是怎样的呢？梁漱溟说：“严格说，只有理性是主人；理智、本能、习惯皆工具。”（“要义”，页三四九）
    这样，梁漱溟就从道德的领域里驱逐了理智，而把前者放在感情的独立统治之下。对梁漱溟来说，客观的理智没有资格来审查“偏于主观”的“理性”——道德的感情，反而是主观的道德的感情应当支配客观的理智。这个拥有无上权威的“理性”，竟是非理智超理智的东西。很显然，梁漱溟的“理性”并不是真正的理性（因为理性和理智是同一的东西，并没有什么超理智的理性），而是反理性的冒名顶替。——梁漱溟实际上是侮辱了“理性”这个庄严的名词。
    理性，按照正确的了解，就是人的运用概念以作判断和推理的能力，也就是逻辑的思维能力。马克思主义者认为，只有依靠理性，人才能够在感觉经验的基础上认识客观世界的本质和规律，而只有认识了客观世界的本质和规律，人才能够正确地指导自己的行为。所以，理性不仅适用于自然的领域，也同样适用于社会的道德的领域。道德观念固然是主观的东西，可是它的根源却是客观物质生活条件。对于一种道德观念，不能单凭感情去接受，而应该经过理性的审核，判断它是不是合理，是不是应该遵守。我们承认感情的重要性。但是排斥了理性或理智的引导，感情就成为一种主观的盲目的力量，就不能使人正确地行动，因此必须用理性来判断感情是不是正确。只有这样，才是真正地尊重理性。梁漱溟限制了理智的活动范围，而让理智成为感情的奴仆和工具，这不过暴露了他是理性的敌人而已。
    我们现在必须冒犯梁漱溟的这个“理性”的主人的尊严，用理智这个“工具”来把它审查一下。
    据梁漱溟说，这种“理性”是一切人生下来就都具有的。“伦理是从情谊出发，原来就是属于道德的；他是在人类自己心里原来就有的，而不是从法律外力加上去的。”（“梁漱溟先生教育文录”）“情理自在人心”（“要义”，页一二七），“过去的人，现在的人，将来的人，都是人；能够认识人类这种精神（理性），是始终不会被打倒的。”（“梁漱溟先生教育文录”）这就是说，“理性”是先天的，它本来就在人的心中，每个人都可以遵照内心的这个“理性”的命令来行动，所以，道德观念的来源和道德的标准都不在客观而在人的心中。
    这样说来，梁漱溟的出发点是人心。这个“人”应该不是具体的现实的人，而是抽象的一般的人；它应该不属于任何时代和任何阶级，而只是一个空洞的没有血肉的“人”的概念。事情很明白，只要说到历史的阶级的人，我们就找不到他们之间共同的道德观念。恩格斯在“反杜林论”里曾经指出：善恶的观念是变化的；封建贵族、资产阶级和无产阶级都各有它自己的特殊的道德。现在梁漱溟既然宣称他已经找到了这样一种普遍的人类的道德，我们倒想知道一下它的内容。关于这个，梁漱溟在他的每本书里都谈得非常之多，我们随便翻开几页，都可以看到他那一套道德的说教：什么“父慈子孝”，什么“安分守己”“知足常乐”，什么“调和妥协，消极节制”“克己、让人、学吃亏”，什么“忠孝和睦，各尽其分，而永不造反”……。
    一眼就可以看出，这并不是什么“过去的人，现在的人，将来的人”所同具的“理性”，而只是中国封建时代的道德观念，提倡这种“理性”的，也不是“人类”，而只是封建阶级和他们的奴才。梁漱溟并没有发现他自以为发现了的东西；他不过是把封建主义的道德标准冒充为一切时代共同的道德标准，把一个封建奴才假扮为和一切人都相同的一般的“人”而已。
    这一套道德规范必须以一个特定的社会——封建社会的经济制度和政治制度为前提。在这个社会里，地主和贵族对农民实行残酷的剥削，而皇帝就是封建阶级的最高代表；整个社会按照宗法的原则建立了一套等级制度，皇帝对于人民，家长对于儿女，都享有绝对的权威。在这个社会里，封建阶级既然在经济上政治上占统治地位，他们也就用他们的道德观念来统治人民的思想。他们把忍耐和服从宣布为美德，正因为他们的压迫和统治使人民不能忍受。他们向农民宣传“知足”，正因为农民已被他们剥削得一无所有。他们赞美“安分”，因为皇帝已经没有“安分”的问题，而需要使被压迫者安于他们的奴隶的身分。至于“忠孝”，就是叫人绝对服从这个宗法制度的权威，所谓“君为臣纲”，所谓“天下无不是的父母”。——这就是梁漱溟所焚香顶礼的那一套道德规范的阶级实质。
    梁漱溟认为这个“理性”产生了古代社会，其实他这个“理性”倒正是封建社会经济基础的产物。西方在封建时代也有过这种封建道德观念，可是这种观念后来失去了它的统治地位，而被资产阶级的道德观念所代替了。资本主义大工业破坏了封建经济基础，同时也破坏了建立在这个基础上的宗法制度和伦理关系。马克思和恩格斯在“共产党宣言”里曾这样描写过这个过程：
      资产阶级在凡是它已达到统治的地方，都把
    所有封建的，宗法的和醇朴的关系一一破坏
    了。它无情地斩断了那些把人们系缠于其“天
    然尊长”的复杂封建羁绊，它使人与人之间除
    了赤条条的利害关系之外，除了冷酷无情的
    “现金交易”之外，再也找不出什么别的联系
    了。……
      资产阶级撕破了家庭关系上面所笼罩着的温
    情脉脉的纱幕，并把这种关系化成了单纯金钱
    的关系。
    梁漱溟虽然竭力要把封建的伦理道德说成是“人类的理性”，但是他也无法否认这件事实：资产阶级虽然也是人，可是并不尊重这个“理性”。对于这一点，梁漱溟只好说，这是中西文化的不同，——中国人（实际上是封建社会）“理性早启”，而西洋人（实际上是资产阶级社会）“理性”不发达。至于再进一步问：为什么会有这不同？梁漱溟再也没有给我们一个圆满的答案。
    要真正说明不同的人们所具有的不同的道德观念和感情，只有研究产生它们的客观的社会的原因。道德观念不是从天上掉下来的，“人情好恶”也不是无缘无故的。封建阶级、资产阶级和无产阶级各有它们自己的道德，各有它们自己的爱憎，因为它们各有不同的阶级地位。梁漱溟把陈腐的封建道德教条宣布为“人类的理性”，不过是想把封建社会理想化，叫历史开倒车而已。
    但是封建社会制度已经充分暴露了它的不合理，用一个“理性”的名词并不能使它合理化。在中国大陆上，封建阶级已经被消灭了，封建主义的统治也一去不返了。梁漱溟不管怎样高唱“理性”，也不能召回死去的阶级的亡魂。封建的道德意识正在被消灭着，因为它所反映的东西，它的基础已经不存在了。然而，“意识落后于存在”，它也不会很快地消灭。反动阶级的代表还会拚命抓住它，梁漱溟就是其中之一。
    马克思主义者根本不承认在阶级社会里有超阶级的道德，当然也否认某一种反映剥削阶级利益的道德可以成为亘古不变的人类的“理性”。马克思主义者公开指出道德的阶级性，同时毅然决然同一切以往的剥削阶级的虚伪的道德断绝关系，建立起本阶级的道德观念——共产主义道德。只有这种道德才是真正的最高的道德。这种道德要求人们自觉地遵守它，因此它不要人蒙蔽理智，而要人发扬理智。只有凭着理智，认识了社会生活的规律，而在这个过程中培养起爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动的感情，人们才会自觉遵守这种道德。这种新型的道德有无限的前途，在未来的社会主义和共产主义社会里，在阶级消灭之后，它将变成全民的道德。
    二
    据梁漱溟说来，在这个“理性”的基础之上，古代的中国人建立了一个“伦理本位”的社会，而“伦理底社会就是重情谊的社会”（“要义”页九六），“伦理关系，即是情谊关系”（同上，页一五○）。这样他就达到了一个唯心的结论：人与人之间的基本关系并不是经济关系，而是心与心的关系，情感的关系。——据梁漱溟说，这也就是“理性”。这样，梁漱溟就把现实的经济政治问题，化为心理的问题：“所谓人对人的问题，其实就是心对心的问题；彼此感召之间，全靠至诚能动。这正是狭义底理性；这亦是最纯粹地向里用力。”（“要义”，页二九三—二九四）
    有没有人与人之间的“情谊关系”？当然有的。可是在人与人之间除开情谊关系外，还有敌对关系；除了心的关系以外，还有物质关系，生产过程中的关系，在阶级社会里，这主要是剥削和被剥削的关系，统治和被统治的关系。经济上的关系，是其他一切人与人的关系，包括“情谊关系”或者“伦理关系”在内的基础。被压迫阶级由于他们共同的地位和命运，彼此之间是有阶级感情的；压迫者之间在他们利益一致的时候，也是有情谊的。但是如果说，在压迫者和被压迫者之间也有普遍的“情谊关系”，那就是抹杀血淋淋的阶级斗争的事实，那就是欺骗。不但如此，统治者和统治者之间也不是都有情谊的。“一部廿四史是相砍书”，谁和谁相砍？地主要镇压农民，农民要反抗地主，所以相砍；统治者要争权夺利，抢做皇帝，所以也相砍。在阶级对抗的社会里，剥削阶级把自己的幸福建筑在被剥削阶级的痛苦的背上，这是阶级社会不可能有普遍的情谊的根本原因。
    于是这里就有两种观点，由这两种观点产生两种做法：
    我们的观点和做法：只要私有制存在，只要阶级剥削的事实存在，就不会有一切人与人之间的情谊；在剥削者与被剥削者之间，真正的问题决不是什么“心对心的问题”，而是经济上的奴役问题，政治上的压迫问题。例如，地主阶级的贪婪、残暴和专横，是由他们所处的封建剥削者的阶级地位决定的，而农民对地主的仇恨，也是农民受地主剥削这一经济事实的必然结果。因此，要永远消除人与人的冲突，只有依靠阶级斗争，用阶级斗争的手段来推翻剥削者，来废除私有财产制度。
    梁漱溟的观点和做法：心与心的关系决定其他的关系，根本问题不在实际的经济制度和政治制度而在人心，因此解决的方法不是阶级斗争，不是革命，而是“向里用力”，而是依靠“理性”。
    于是梁漱溟就用“温情脉脉的纱幕”来掩盖那冷酷的阶级压迫的事实，竭力歌颂他所谓的中国古人的“理性”。这个“理性”也就是梁漱溟在“东西文化及其哲学”里所说的对人生的第二种根本态度，就是“以意欲自为调和，持中为其根本精神的”。据说这就是中国文化的“精神”。“理性”的主要内容是什么，就是“向里用力”，就是“无私”“不争”“和谐”“克己”，等等：——理性之取舍不一，而要以无私底感情为中心。（“要义”，页一三八）中国古人却正有见于人类生命之和谐。——人自身是和谐底，人与人是和谐底，以人为中心的整个宇宙是和谐底……此和谐之点，即清明安和之心，即理性。（同上，页一四四—一四五）伦理之义，互以对方为重；几于舍自己的立场而以对方的立场为立场……从来未闻有以斗争为道者，却另有一套克己、让人、学吃亏的哲学。（“答乡村建设批判”）他（孔子）使你无所得而畅快，不是使你有所得而满足；他使你忘物忘我忘一切，不使你分别物我而逐求。（“中国民族自救运动之最后觉悟”，页六八）我们试把这些话按照它们的实质上的涵义翻译出来，那就是这样：你要放弃自己的利益而忍受地主的剥削，否则你就不是以“理性”为取舍了，你就是一个自私的人了；你要忘掉反动统治者和人民的对立，而看出他们之间的“和谐”，不然的话，你就丧失了“清明安和之心”，也就是丧失“理性”了；你要尊重敌人，要放弃自己的立场而站到他的立场上去，要让他，要学吃亏；不但如此，你抛弃了这一切之后，还应该觉得很畅快，因为你已经“忘物忘我忘一切”了，你已经是一个最有“理性”的人了。
    这样一个在梁漱溟眼中最有“理性”的人，不是别的，正是一个丧失了起码的人的尊严，没有一点血性的恭顺的奴隶。这个奴隶并不需要肉体上的桎梏，因为他的内心已经套上枷锁了。这就是梁漱溟说的“理性”是在人的心中，并不需要“法律外力加上去”；的确，这个心灵的枷锁比法律的桎梏要牢固得多。
    梁漱溟认为，“理性”虽然是人人具有的，可是只有一种人有资格代表它，这就是中国封建社会的“士”：“士人不事生产，却于社会有其绝大功用；便是他代表理性，主持教化，维持秩序”（“理论”，页四三）。士人的作用，就是向皇帝和人民“这两面作工夫”：
      在君主一面说，他越用武力自己越不容易安
    稳；实不如施温情，兴教化，以理性示人。
    在民众一面说，所需要者原为勤俭的鼓励与情
    谊的敦笃。……此时唯有借重士人，一面常提
    醒规谏君主，……一面常教训老百姓要忠孝和
    睦，各尽其分，而永不造反。如是，就适合了
    双方的需要而缓和了他们的冲突。不然的话，
    君主发威，老百姓固然受不了；老百姓揭竿而
    起，造反亦很容易。（同上，页四五）梁漱溟把这种“士人”说成是真正居间的第三者，但实际上这种人是为皇帝服务的，因为他们的“工夫”正是巩固了这个封建秩序，使君主的皇位“安稳”，使老百姓不“造反”。
    梁漱溟自己也就是这种“士”，是现代中国的保皇党和卫道者，他是代表“理性”来向人民“施温情，兴教化”，教我们“永不造反”。梁漱溟说，他要建立一个新的社会组织，“这个社会组织乃是以伦理情谊为本原，以人生向上为目的，……这样纯粹是一个理性组织，他充分发挥了人类的精神（理性）”（同上，页一七五）。梁漱溟认为这种组织应当从乡村做起，所以他名之曰“乡农学校”。当然，这样一种组织也并不是纯粹的中国货，它是“吸收了西洋人的长处”，即资本主义政治组织的所谓“长处”的。在“乡农学校”里也有一个“代表理性”的，就是校长，又名学长，也就是乡长。这个学长既然代表“理性”，所以“要他来监督教训众人”（同上，页二四七），而“大家要接受学长的训斥”（同上，页二五一）。不消说，他的目的也是叫农民“永不造反”。
    梁漱溟的所谓“乡村建设运动”，正是拿这种所谓“中国式的理性主义”为理论基础的。梁漱溟说：“中国伦理推家人之情以及于社会一切关系，明著其互以对方为重之义，总使它对立不起来。”（“要义”，页二二六）梁漱溟自己也就是这样宣扬“理性”，总要使农民和地主，人民和反动统治者“对立不起来”，使被压迫者驯良地忍受剥削而不作任何反抗。梁漱溟说，他是反对共产党领导的农民运动的，因为这种“农民运动是在乡村社会里首先作一种分化的工夫，使乡村社会成为分离对抗的形势，在乡村社会之内就发生斗争”（“论文集”，页一四○）。至于梁漱溟呢，他搞的并不是“农民运动”而是“乡村运动”，就是不分什么地主和农民，而“看乡村是一个整个的”（同上），乡村的问题“要尽可能的避免斗争，从理性求解决”（“理论”，页二八二）。换句话说，就是抹杀阶级矛盾，叫农民放弃斗争，同地主“和谐”起来，合为“一体”。于是反动统治阶级的江山就坐稳了，他们可以安心睡觉了，此之谓“天下太平”：
      天下太平之内容，就是人人在伦理关系上都
    各自作到好处，（所谓父父子子）大家相安相
    保，养生送死而无憾。（“要义”，页九一）
    梁漱溟的“理性主义”就是这样一种镇压人民，反对革命的精神武器。这种武器不像刺刀那样容易激起人的反抗，它做的是软功夫，是“攻心战”，是要解除我们的武装。因此，梁漱溟这种办法也就更高明，更毒辣！
    挥舞着这个武器，梁漱溟就叫嚷着反对共产党，反对暴力革命。他说，“武力之为物，妨碍理性”（“答乡村建设批判”）。在解放战争时期，他把蒋介石的反人民的内战和人民的革命混同起来，表示态度说：“对于任何题目底暴力革命，或任何题目底对内作战，均不承认，反对到底。”（“树立信用。力求合作”）他在一九四九年二月全国即将解放时写了一篇“敬告中国共产党”的文章，其中说：“我对于中共之滥用武力，却一直是不赞成。”“武力与民主，其性不相容；武力统一之下，不会有民主底。”“我郑重请求中国共产党，你们必须容许一切异己者之存在。”这就是说，我们用武装革命来推翻国民党的武装反革命，那就是不“民主”，不讲“理性”；要讲“民主”和“理性”，就要容许反民主的国民党反动派存在。——梁漱溟的“理性”究竟对谁有利，那是不言自明的。
    毫无疑问，如果把这种“理论”应用在当前的问题上，那就是说，我们不应该肃清反革命分子，不应该向资产阶级进行斗争，不应该进行社会主义革命。
    中国共产党并没有接受梁漱溟的所谓“敬告”，它不顾这一套谬论而执行了人民的意志，坚决把革命进行到底。对人民的民主和对反动派的专政，这是不可分的两面——没有后者就没有前者。武力，只要是出于人民的意志，只要是对反动派用的，那就决不会妨碍民主，而只会保障民主。历史已经证明，一切反动阶级都不会自动退出历史舞台的，因此人民必须用武力推翻他们，在推翻他们之后还要用武力镇压他们的反抗。阶级斗争不是谁喜欢不喜欢的问题，它是历史的规律。在阶级社会里高唱普遍的“和谐”，那是闭眼说谎。只有在未来的社会主义共产主义社会中，在大同世界里，才能根本消灭产生人与人的冲突的物质根源，才能有人与人之间的普遍的亲密关系——全社会的同志式的互助与合作。
    三
    为了彻底清算这种“理性主义”的谬论，我们还须进一步批判它的宇宙观的基础。这种宇宙观是说，宇宙的自身就是一个大生命，而人的生命是和这个“宇宙大生命”相通的，——所谓“人类生命通乎天地万物而无隔”（“要义”，页一四九）。因此，“宇宙大生命”的“理”也是和人的心理相通的，不但如此，而且后者就是前者的最高表现。人凭借自己心中的“理性”，就能认识自己的生命和别人的生命，也能认识整个“宇宙大生命”，从而达到“人我一体”“天人合一”的神秘境界。
      什么叫作自然？什么叫作合理？自然就是合
    理；合理就是合乎自然之理。这是一句话，不
    是两句话。那么，到底所谓自然是何指呢？自
    然是指宇宙大生命说；自然之理即是宇宙大生
    命的最活泼处——人类心理。宇宙大生命的活
    泼唯寄于人类；人类而外已不能表现宇宙大生
    命的活泼了。所谓合理，质言之，就是合乎人
    类心理的要求。此要求是跟着宇宙生命来的，
    是自然的。其最强的要求即是宇宙大生命活泼
    的最高点。我常爱说的“理性”亦就是这个。
    归结下来，我们必须得认识人类，认识人类生
    命的特殊（理性）；认识了这个，亦就晓得所
    谓自然合理的根据了。（“理论”，页四五四）
    这一段话把梁漱溟的哲学表达得很清楚。按照这种哲学，不但人有生命，而且山河大地，日月星辰也都有生命。而这一切生命，从砂粒到太阳，从脚下的地球到几万万光年以外的星云，都要服从梁漱溟的心理的要求（梁漱溟说成是“人类心理的要求”），都要围绕梁漱溟心中的这个“理性”而旋转。——如果它们不听从的话，那就是“不合理”。道德的秩序变成了自然的律令，人事的规范成了宇宙的法则。——这样，梁漱溟就完成了他的唯心论体系，把他的“理性”捧到至高无上的神圣的地位，而同时也把他的唯心论哲学推进到了荒谬绝伦的顶端。
    这种哲学是有它的思想根源的，梁漱溟只是贴上“理性”这个商标，并没有制造出什么新的货色。这种哲学是王阳明一派的封建主义的儒家哲学和柏格森一派的西方资本主义没落时期的生命主义哲学的结合。
    王阳明是主观唯心论者，他说过：“夫人者，天地之心；天地万物，本吾一体者也。”（“王文成公全集”，下同）“盖天地万物，与人原是一体，其发窍之最精处，是人心的一点灵明。”（用梁漱溟的话来说，就是：宇宙大生命的最活泼处即是人类心理。）王阳明否认有离开人的意识而独立存在的物质和客观规律，认为万事万物的“理”本来就在人的心中，因此认识的问题不是去如实地反映外界，而是返回到自己的内心，从内心中去发现那个“理”。他把这个叫做“良知”。“吾心之良知，即所谓天理也”。良知和天理是一个东西，而天理就是道德的规范：“夫礼也者，天理也”。“礼字即是理字”。（这个“天理”的“理”，也就是梁漱溟的“情理”的“理”，“理性”的“理”。）这个良知是亘古不变的，是先天的，是统治宇宙的：“盖良知之在人心，亘万古，塞宇宙，而无不同。……先天而天不违。”这种良知又是非理性的东西，它就是孟子说的那个“不虑而知”的良知，它又只是一种主观的好恶的感情：“良知只是个是非之心，是非只是个好恶。”
    梁漱溟除开继承这种思想外，又接受了柏格森的哲学。柏格森是一个帝国主义资产阶级哲学家，是神秘主义者，生命派哲学的代表，他的哲学是以反理性反科学而臭名昭著的。柏格森把全部科学的结论作了一百八十度的颠倒，他宣称：宇宙的本源是生命，宇宙的进化是生命之流的冲动。这种神秘的“生之冲动”抵抗着物质的阻力而发展，其结果就成为生物，而在某一个地方前进得最远，这就是人。（这也就是梁漱溟说的人的心理是宇宙大生命的最活泼处。）柏格森在他的主要著作之一“创化论”里说，生命之流就是“大心”，而“各生物之心，乃大心之分支”（依张东荪译文，下同），因此，“吾人实与全宇宙相浑一”。
    但是，要怎样才能认识生命这个“本体”，达到“与全宇宙相浑一”的境界呢？柏格森说，这是不能靠理智的，因为理智只能认识事物的表面；要认识生命的本体必须依靠一种神秘的“直觉”。直觉的位置是在理智之上的：“直觉比较理智更近于生命”（“心力”，胡国钰译），“直觉实超乎智慧”（“创化论”）。柏格森也把“理”分为两种，他把科学上的客观物质的规律叫作“几何的理”，把道德和艺术等有关精神的“理”叫作“生命的理”或“意欲的理”（梁漱溟的“物理”和“情理”就是从这里来的）。后面这一种“理”是根本的，而科学不能认识它，直觉才能认识它。就这样，柏格森公开表示了他对科学和理智的仇视。
    梁漱溟的“理性”，基本上（说基本上，因为还有别的来源，如罗素）就是王阳明的“良知”和柏格森的“直觉”的结合。
    如果我们看看梁漱溟的早期著作“东西文化及其哲学”，可以发现其中很少谈“理性”，就是谈到也是采取排斥态度的。这本著作里大谈而特谈的是“直觉”。他赞美地说，孔子是直觉主义者，“一般人是要讲理的，孔子是不讲理的；一般人是求其通的；孔子则简直不通！然而结果一般人之通却成不通，而孔子之不通则通之至。盖孔子总任他的直觉……我们的行为动作，实际上都是直觉支配我们的，理智支配他不动”（页一二四）。他明白地把儒家的“良知”和柏格森的“直觉”联在一起：“不虑而知的良知，不学而能的良能，在今日我们谓之直觉。”（页一二五）这个直觉和良知是和理智对立的，因此梁漱溟叫人排斥理智，叫人“不讲理”：“所怕理智出来分别一个物我，而打量计较，以致直觉退位，成了不仁。”（页一二八）
    但柏格森的“直觉”，就是本能。梁漱溟后来觉得，这种说法还显不出这个观念的“超离于物”，而且本能和他所反对的所谓“私欲”也是有些分不清的。于是他找到了一个新名称：理性。从此他也要“讲理”了，而且据他说，孔子也是一贯“讲理”的了。当然，前面已经说过，这个“理”不是科学的理和理智的理。他的“理性”是属于感情方面的，而梁漱溟说过，“一切情感俱属直觉”（“哲学”，页一○二）。由此可见，他所谓的“理性主义”，不是别的，恰恰是反理性主义。
    这种反理性主义也就是一种神秘主义。梁漱溟告诉我们说，发扬了这种“理性”，就可以达到一种最高的超然的境界，在这种境界里，人和人之间，人和自然之间的一切对立都消失了，“我”也消失了：“此际一片天理流行，无彼我之见存，是曰‘无对’；表现在意识上，即是理性。”（“要义”，页二九三）
    也许有人是能达到这种神秘的“无对”的境界吧，但那不是在现实生活里，而是在他自己的幻觉中。他可以自认为得了这种“洞悟”，可是他的身体还依然处在“有对”的现实世界中。他不过是用一种宗教式的信仰来作自我麻醉罢了。
    而梁漱溟的“理性主义”，在剥去伪装以后，就是赤裸裸的信仰主义。这也是不难了解的。排斥了理智或理性，就必然抬高了盲目的信仰。梁漱溟说，他的“理性”是和愚昧不相容的，其实他正是要使人愚昧。他所要传布的就是一种变相的宗教，一种宗教的代用品。——它的上帝是“宇宙大生命”，它的天国是粉饰过的旧中国社会，它的仪式是礼乐，它的教条是“理性”。梁漱溟发现了，中国古代是“以道德代宗教”，而“伦理有宗教之用”，所以他现在要恢复孔子的礼乐，要传布儒家的福音。他自己给这种宗教取了一个名称：“伦理教”（“要义”，页九五）。
    梁漱溟傲然地说过，“能够认识人类这种精神（理性），是始终不会被打倒的”。我们现在要对他说：不对，梁漱溟先生！你的“理论”已经被人民大革命的胜利的事实所打倒，也不能不被马克思主义驳倒！
