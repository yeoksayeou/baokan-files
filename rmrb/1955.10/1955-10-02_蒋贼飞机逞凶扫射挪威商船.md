Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Planes Commit Atrocities, Strafe Norwegian Merchant Ship

    At 13:40 on September 27th, four American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit F-84 fighter planes brazenly strafed the Norwegian merchant ship "Hai Hou" in the sea area near Shantou City, Guangdong Province, resulting in 11 deaths and injuries on board.

    The American-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes strafed the "Hai Hou" three times, riddling the ship's hull with 410 bullet holes. Two staff members and passengers on board were instantly killed by the gunfire, and nine people were injured. The injured included Captain Hjeldeheim and several foreign crew members. After the incident, the local authorities of Shantou City and the Red Cross immediately sent personnel to the ship to provide first aid and express condolences, and the injured were sent to the hospital for treatment.

    The "Hai Hou" arrived in Hong Kong from Shantou on the afternoon of September 28th. According to Hong Kong news, Ivar Melhuus, the Norwegian Consul in Hong Kong, commented on the strafing of the merchant ship by Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes, saying, "The facts show that the ship was sailing peacefully at the time," and "The Norwegian flag on it was clearly visible." He denounced the atrocities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes, saying, "The attack itself speaks volumes. Isn't this like murder?" (Xinhua News Agency)

    蒋贼飞机逞凶扫射挪威商船
    九月二十七日十三时四十分，美制蒋贼F—八十四型飞机四架，在广东省汕头市附近海面逞凶扫射挪威商船“海后号”，船上死伤十一人。
    美制蒋贼飞机对“海后号”进行了三次扫射，船身被子弹洞穿四百一十处，船上工作人员和旅客二名当场中弹惨死、九人受伤。受伤者中包括船长耶尔德赫姆和外国籍船员多人。事件发生后，我汕头市地方当局及红十字会立刻派人到船上进行急救和慰问，并把受伤人员送到医院治疗。
    “海后号”已在九月二十八日下午由汕头驶抵香港。据香港消息，挪威驻香港领事伊瓦尔·麦尔吴斯就这艘商船被蒋贼飞机扫射一事发表谈话说：“事实表明，这艘船当时是和平航行的”，而且，“上面的挪威国旗是可以清楚地看见的”。他斥责蒋贼飞机的暴行说：“这次袭击本身就说明一切，这还不是像谋杀吗？”　（新华社）
