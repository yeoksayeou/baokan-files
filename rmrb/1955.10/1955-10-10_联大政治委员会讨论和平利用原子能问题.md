Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 8th: According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the peaceful use of atomic energy on the 7th. This issue is divided into two items: (A) International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy – Report of the Secretary-General; (B) Development of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy – Reports of governments.

    Britain, the United States, and Australia submitted a joint proposal on this issue. This proposal refers to the desire expressed in the General Assembly resolution to rapidly establish an International Atomic Energy Agency; and notes with satisfaction the great progress made in negotiations to draft the statute for the establishment of this agency. The proposal expresses satisfaction with the work of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy and recommends that a second international conference be convened under the auspices of the United Nations in about three years.

    India, Burma, Indonesia, and Yugoslavia submitted a proposal on item A of the issue under discussion, expressing satisfaction with the results achieved by the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in promoting the free exchange of scientific knowledge on the production and peaceful use of atomic energy. The proposal recommends declaring that the General Assembly considers it appropriate to continue to convene international conferences on the peaceful uses of atomic energy at appropriate times.

    India, Burma, Indonesia, and Yugoslavia also submitted another proposal on item B of the issue under discussion. This proposal points out that the statute and functions of the International Atomic Energy Agency "should be based on the coordination of the various viewpoints expressed in the General Assembly and the opinions of the governments concerned, and should be approved by the General Assembly." The proposal points out that regarding the relationship between this agency and the United Nations, it should be stipulated that annual reports to the United Nations General Assembly and other information on the work of the agency should be submitted. The proposal recommends the establishment of a committee responsible for achieving the above-mentioned objectives.

    All three of the above proposals advocate maintaining the advisory committee previously established by the General Assembly to prepare for the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy.

    During the discussion, the Indian representative, Menon, suggested that the committee should separately review the two above-mentioned issues concerning the peaceful use of atomic energy and make separate decisions.

    The chairman of the committee suggested postponing the discussion of the proposal put forward by the Indian representative to allow the American representative, Pastore, to speak.

    In his speech, Pastore pointed out the great significance of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy held in Geneva. He said that the United States believes that a second international conference should be held within the next three years. Speaking about the establishment of an international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy, Pastore said that the US delegation hopes to reach a general agreement on the statute of the international agency by the beginning of 1956. He said that a copy of the draft statute of this international agency had been sent to the Soviet Union in July, and that the Soviet Union's comments on this draft had been received and were "being carefully studied." Speaking about the relationship between this agency and the United Nations, Pastore emphasized that the United States believes that the relationship between this agency and the United Nations should be the same as the existing relationship between the United Nations and the specialized agencies.

    After Pastore's speech, the meeting of the Political Committee on the 7th was adjourned. The next meeting is scheduled for the 10th.

    As the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the peaceful use of atomic energy on the 7th, American newspapers published numerous commentaries, commenting on the draft statute of the international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy proposed by the United States and seven other proposing countries. "The New York Times" also published the full text of this draft. The publication by American newspapers of the draft statute of this agency, which was previously considered "secret," caused surprise among United Nations personnel. It is believed here that this fact proves that the United States hopes to draw people's attention to this draft before the United Nations General Assembly has the opportunity to consider the issue of the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    联大政治委员会讨论和平利用原子能问题
    新华社九日讯　据塔斯社纽约八日讯：联合国大会政治委员会七日开始讨论和平利用原子能问题，这个问题分为两项：（甲）和平利用原子能国际会议——总书记的报告；（乙）和平利用原子能方面的国际合作的发展情况——各国政府的报告。
    英国、美国和澳大利亚就这个问题提出一项联合提案。这个提案提到大会决议中所表示的关于迅速建立国际原子能机构的愿望；并且满意地指出，为建立这个机构而进行的关于拟订章程草案的谈判已经取得很大的成就。提案表示对和平利用原子能国际会议的工作感到满意，并且建议大约在三年内在联合国组织主持下召开第二次国际会议。
    印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和南斯拉夫就讨论中的问题的甲项提出一个提案，这个提案对和平利用原子能国际会议在促进关于生产和和平利用原子能的科学知识的自由交流方面所取得的成果表示满意。提案建议宣布，大会认为在适当的时候继续召开和平利用原子能国际会议是适宜的。
    印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和南斯拉夫还就讨论中的问题的乙项提出了另一个提案。这个提案指出，国际原子能机构的章程和职能，“应当以在大会上所表示的各种观点以及有关政府的意见所取得的协调为基础，并且应当由大会批准。”提案指出，关于这个机构同联合国组织的关系，应该规定向联合国大会每年提出报告以及有关这个机构工作的其他情报。提案建议成立一个委员会负责实现上述目的。
    上述三个提案都主张维持大会从前为筹备和平利用原子能国际会议而设立的咨询委员会。
    在会议进行讨论时，印度代表梅农提出建议，主张由委员会分别审议上述两个关于和平利用原子能的问题，并分别作出决定。
    委员会主席建议迟一些讨论印度代表提出的建议，让美国代表帕斯托发言。
    帕斯托在发言中指出了在日内瓦举行的和平利用原子能国际会议的重大意义。他说，美国认为，第二次国际会议应该在最近三年之内举行。帕斯托谈到关于建立和平利用原子能国际机构时说，美国代表团希望在一九五六年年初就国际机构的章程达成总的协议。他说，这一国际机构的章程草案副本已经在七月送交苏联，并且已经收到苏联对这一草案的意见，这些意见“正在加以仔细研究”。帕斯托谈到这一机构和联合国组织之间的关系时着重指出，美国认为，这一机构和联合国的关系应该像联合国和各专门机构之间的现有关系一样。
    在帕斯托发言后，政治委员会七日会议宣告结束。下次会议定于十日举行。
    在联合国大会政治委员会七日开始讨论和平利用原子能问题的时候，美国报纸纷纷发表评论，评论美国和其他七个提案国所提出的和平利用原子能国际机构的章程草案。“纽约时报”还刊载了这个草案的全文。美国报纸把在这以前被认为“秘密的”关于这个机构的章程草案发表出来，在联合国人士中引起了惊奇。这里认为这一个事实证明了美国希望还在联合国大会有机会考虑和平利用原子能问题以前就引起人们对这一草案的注意。
