Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the afternoon of October 19th to continue the election of a non-permanent member of the Security Council, which had not been elected in the previous election, to replace Turkey, whose term is about to expire. As previously reported, at the last plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly, neither Yugoslavia nor the Philippines, the two candidate countries, obtained the required two-thirds majority to be elected.

The atmosphere at the 19th meeting was tense because the U.S. delegation was exerting systematic pressure on certain delegations in an attempt to undermine the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the London Gentlemen's Agreement and forcibly insert the Philippines into the Security Council to occupy a seat that should belong to an Eastern European country. A total of three votes were taken on the 19th, and neither Yugoslavia nor the Philippines obtained the required majority. In the first and third votes, Yugoslavia received 27 votes and the Philippines received 31 votes. In the second vote, Yugoslavia received 28 votes and the Philippines received 30 votes.

Although the election of the Security Council is conducted by secret ballot, representatives, especially journalists, widely discussed outside the meeting that, apart from the United States, only Latin American countries and countries like Iraq and Thailand voted in favor of the Philippines. The Soviet Union, Eastern European countries, the United Kingdom and most other countries in the British Commonwealth, all European countries, and most Arab and Asian countries voted in favor of Yugoslavia, opposing the U.S. attempt.

Seeing that the direct pressure it was exerting was not effective, the U.S. delegation played procedural tricks. It suggested postponing the continuation of the election of Security Council members and proceeding with the election of members of the Economic and Social Council and the Trusteeship Council. Yugoslavia was also among the candidates for the Economic and Social Council. According to U.S. newspapers, the U.S. delegation was playing this procedural trick in order to obstruct Yugoslavia's election to the Security Council once it was elected as a member of the Economic and Social Council.

Norwegian representative Engen expressed opposition to the suggestion made by the U.S. delegation. He proposed postponing the elections of the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, and the Trusteeship Council. This suggestion was supported by the representatives of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the United Kingdom.

However, as a result of the vote, after the General Assembly passed the postponement of the election of Security Council members, it then passed a motion to immediately begin the election of members of the Economic and Social Council and the Trusteeship Council with 26 votes in favor, 20 votes against, and 13 abstentions.

The General Assembly then proceeded to elect six members of the Economic and Social Council to replace Australia, India, Turkey, the United States, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia, whose terms will expire at the end of this year. After five secret ballots, four new members were elected—the United States, Canada, Indonesia, and Yugoslavia. In the voting for the other two new members, none of the candidates obtained the required majority. Greece, Brazil, Afghanistan, and Costa Rica were competing for these two seats.

The General Assembly will continue to hold elections for members of the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, and the Security Council on the 20th.

    联大十九日选举安理会非常任理事国还没有结果
    美国要使菲律宾当选的企图遭到广泛反对
    新华社二十一日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会十月十九日下午举行全体会议，继续选举前次选举中没有选出的一个安全理事会非常任理事国，以接替任期即将届满的土耳其。前已报道，在联合国大会上次全体会议上，南斯拉夫和菲律宾这两个候选国没有一个获得当选所必需的三分之二多数。
    十九日会议情况紧张，因为美国代表团对某些代表团施加了有计划的压力，企图破坏联合国宪章的规定和伦敦君子协定，硬把菲律宾安插进安全理事会去占据应当属于东欧国家的席位。十九日共进行了三次投票，南斯拉夫和菲律宾都没有得到必需的多数。在第一次和第三次投票中，南斯拉夫得到二十七票，菲律宾得到三十一票。在第二次投票中，南斯拉夫得到二十八票，菲律宾得到三十票。
    虽然安全理事会的选举是采取秘密投票的方式进行的，但是代表们、尤其是记者们在会外广泛地谈论说除了美国以外，投票赞成菲律宾的只有拉丁美洲国家和伊拉克、泰国这样一些国家。苏联、东欧国家、英国和英联邦大多数其他国家、所有的欧洲国家以及大多数阿拉伯和亚洲国家都投票赞成南斯拉夫，而反对美国的企图。
    美国代表团看到它施加的直接压力并不发生效果，就在程序上玩弄花样。它建议延期继续选举安全理事会理事国，而着手选举经济及社会理事会和托管理事会理事国。在经济及社会理事会理事国的候选国中也有南斯拉夫。据美国报纸报道，美国代表团玩弄这种程序上的花样是为了在一旦南斯拉夫被选为经济及社会理事会理事国之后，就好阻挠它当选为安全理事会理事国。
    挪威代表恩根表示反对美国代表团提出的建议。他提议把安全理事会、经济及社会理事会和托管理事会的选举都延期举行。这个建议得到苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和英国代表的支持。
    但是，投票结果，大会在通过延期选举安全理事会理事国以后，又以二十六票赞成、二十票反对和十三票弃权通过了立即开始选举经济及社会理事会和托管理事会理事国的动议。
    大会接着就选举经济及社会理事会六个理事国以接替将在今年年底任期届满的澳大利亚、印度、土耳其、美国、委内瑞拉和南斯拉夫。经过五次秘密投票，选出了四个新理事国——美国、加拿大、印度尼西亚和南斯拉夫。在其他两个新理事国的投票中，没有一个候选国获得必需的多数，竞选这两个席位的有希腊、巴西、阿富汗和哥斯达黎加。
    大会将在二十日继续进行经济及社会理事会、托管理事会和安全理事会理事国的选举。
