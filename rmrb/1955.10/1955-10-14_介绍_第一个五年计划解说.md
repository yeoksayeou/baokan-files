Introducing “An Explanation of the First Five-Year Plan”
		Chen Dao
		Edited by Fang Weizhong, published by Workers' Publishing House

	It is an urgent matter to popularly explain the basic contents of the First Five-Year Plan to the broad masses of the people. Because the completion of this plan ultimately depends on the initiative and creativity of all the people, especially the working class. Only when the working people and the broad masses of workers understand the basic content of this plan and the various policies related to it, and understand the great significance of realizing this plan, will they have a high degree of consciousness to strive for the realization of this plan.
	It is not easy to systematically and popularly explain the First Five-Year Plan. The activities of each department of the national economy and the relationship between the various economic departments are unfamiliar to many people; moreover, the plan itself cannot be separated from numbers, and a large number of numbers often make people feel dull. So, how should we explain the First Five-Year Plan clearly to the broad masses of the people? The book "An Explanation of the First Five-Year Plan" makes an attempt.
	The writing characteristics of the book "An Explanation of the First Five-Year Plan" are, first of all, that the language is popular and the narration is visualized. This book can be understood by people with a lower level of education. Although it does not give people as much fun as Ilyin's "Story of the Five-Year Plan," it sometimes uses gold to convert the investment during the Five-Year Plan period, and sometimes takes you around the fourteen Five-Year Industrial Construction Plan Exhibition Halls. In this way, you will not feel the dryness of the numbers during reading, and you will still have a deep impression after reading.
	Secondly, it takes care of people's level of knowledge and makes many explanations. On the role of various industrial sectors, the relationship between light and heavy industry, the relationship between industry and agriculture, the relationship between industry, agriculture and other construction undertakings, and the relationship between developing production and improving the people's material and cultural living standards, the author has made explanations. These explanations are generally more vivid, and you can increase your knowledge after reading.
	Third, it has full of emotion. The author painfully described the poverty, backwardness, and imperialist bullying of old China, excitedly reported the achievements to be achieved in various constructions, and joyfully looked forward to the victory of the First Five-Year Plan and socialist construction. The author's words are closely linked to people's hearts, making people want to finish reading the book in one breath.
	Because of these characteristics, coupled with the help of statistical charts and photos, this book is easily accepted by the vast number of readers, thus helping them to systematically understand the First Five-Year Plan.
	The reason why this book is worth introducing, in addition to its writing characteristics, is more importantly that it has a clear ideological nature. First of all, the whole book is permeated with such a red line, that is: the First Five-Year Plan is a plan to guide our country to advance along the socialist road. Under the subheadings "Socialist Prospects" and "Two Preliminary Foundations and One Foundation," the author focuses on elaborating that the basis for formulating the First Five-Year Plan is the Party's general line during the transition period, and the basic task of this plan is to establish the preliminary foundations for socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, as well as the foundation for socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Such elaboration is also scattered in other chapters. After reading, people understand that the First Five-Year Plan is the concretization of the Party's general line during the transition period, and that "taking the socialist road" is originally taking it this way; thereby encouraging people's love for socialism and transforming this love into the material force for realizing the First Five-Year Plan.
	Another red line running through the whole book is the idea that the main body of our country's socialist construction is socialist industrialization. The author uses more than 40% of the book's length to repeatedly explain that the strong material foundation of socialism is heavy industry, and the construction of 156 enterprises designed by the Soviet Union to help our country is the "center of the center" of the First Five-Year Plan; pointing out that in our country there are three five-year plans, and a happy socialist society can come, and after four or fifty years, we can catch up with or surpass the industrially developed capitalist countries. Many chapters explain this way: the faster socialist industrialization develops, the faster socialist transformation progresses, the faster the exploiting classes are eliminated, and the faster the people's material living standards improve. After reading, people understand that concentrating efforts on developing heavy industry is related to the country's prosperity and the people's happiness; thereby promoting the fine tradition of hard work and overcoming all possible difficulties.
	The last chapter of this book also points out that the realization of the Five-Year Plan is a special form of class struggle. Under the title "Raise Vigilance, Strengthen Unity," the author analyzes the situation of class struggle under the increasing socialist components and the continuous weakening of non-socialist components, pointing out that enemies at home and abroad will not be reconciled to their failure, and requiring to be vigilant at all times and to fight against the sabotage activities of hidden counter-revolutionary elements. After reading, people understand that building socialism is an extremely complex and acute class struggle, and therefore raise vigilance, oppose complacency, and strive to eliminate all hidden counter-revolutionary elements.
	Finally, it should be pointed out that this book also has some shortcomings, the most important of which is that the socialist transformation of agriculture is not explained sufficiently. The author wrote only a few pages on the issue of cooperativization. The Party's class policy in rural areas was not even mentioned. In addition, the idea of class struggle is not sufficiently implemented throughout the book. When talking about industrial development speed, the investment ratio between light and heavy industry, the unified purchase and sale of grain, and the insufficient supply of consumer goods, the author focuses on explaining the positive reasons, and rarely refutes erroneous arguments head-on. These erroneous arguments reflect the views of a certain class, and these many disputes are essentially class struggle. Exposing these disputes would make people feel the actual education of class struggle and realize that there is class struggle on all fronts, in all departments, and in all work positions. It is hoped that the author will correct these shortcomings in the reprinting.

    介绍“第一个五年计划解说”
    陈道
    房维中编著　工人出版社出版
    向广大人民通俗地解释第一个五年计划的基本内容，是一件迫切的事情。因为这个计划的完成，归根到底要依靠全体人民，尤其是工人阶级的积极性和创造性。只有当劳动人民和广大职工晓得这个计划的基本内容和跟它有关的各项政策，了解实现这个计划的重大意义时，他们才会有高度的自觉为实现这个计划而奋斗。
    有系统地、通俗地讲解第一个五年计划，并不太容易。国民经济每个部门的活动和各经济部门之间的关系，对许多人说来是生疏的；而且，计划本身离不了数字，大量的数字也往往令人感到沉闷。那么，到底应该怎样向广大人民群众讲清楚第一个五年计划呢？“第一个五年计划解说”这本书作了一个尝试。
    “第一个五年计划解说”这本书写作上的特点，首先是文字通俗、叙述形象化。这本书是文化程度较低的人能够看懂的，它虽不像伊林在“五年计划的故事”里那样给人们以丰富的趣味，但一会儿给你用黄金折算五年计划期间的投资，一会儿带你走遍十四座五年工业建设计划展览馆，这样，在阅读当中就不会感到数字的枯燥，读完还留着深刻的印象。
    其次，是照顾人们的知识水平，做了许多解释。在工业各部门的作用、轻重工业的关系、工农业的关系、工农业和其他各项建设事业的关系以及发展生产和提高人民物质文化水平的关系等等问题上，作者都作了说明。这些说明一般都较生动，读完了可以增长知识。
    第三，是有充沛的感情。作者沉痛地叙述了旧中国的贫穷、落后和处处受帝国主义欺侮，兴奋地报道各项建设将要达到的成就，欢欣地指望第一个五年计划的胜利和社会主义的建设。作者说的话紧紧地扣住人们的心弦，叫人很想一口气读完这本书。
    因为具有以上这些特点，再加上统计图表和照片的帮助，这本书就容易被广大读者所接受，从而帮助他们系统地了解第一个五年计划。
    这本书所以值得介绍，除了写作上的特点外，更重要的是它具有鲜明的思想性。首先，全书贯串着这样一根红线，就是：第一个五年计划是引导我国沿社会主义道路前进的计划。在“社会主义展望”和“两个初步基础和一个基础”等小标题下，作者集中阐述了制定第一个五年计划的根据是党在过渡时期的总路线，这个计划的基本任务就是建立社会主义工业化和农业、手工业社会主义改造的初步基础，以及对资本主义工商业社会主义改造的基础。这样的阐述也散见于其他章节。叫人读完之后懂得：第一个五年计划就是党在过渡时期总路线的具体化，“走社会主义道路”原来就是这样走；从而鼓舞人们对社会主义的热爱，并把这种热爱转化为实现第一个五年计划的物质力量。
    贯串全书的另一根红线，就是：我国社会主义建设的主体是社会主义工业化的思想。作者用了全书百分之四十以上的篇幅，反复阐明社会主义的强大的物质基础是重工业，苏联帮助我国设计的一百五十六项企业的建设是第一个五年计划“中心的中心”；指出在我国有三个五年计划，幸福的社会主义社会就能到来，经过四、五十年就能赶上或超过工业发达的资本主义国家。许多章节都这样说明：社会主义工业化发展得越快，社会主义改造也进展得越快，剥削阶级也消灭得越快，人民物质生活水平也就提高得越快。使人们读完之后就懂得：集中力量发展重工业关系国家富强和人民幸福；从而发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，克服一切可能遇到的困难。
    这本书的最后一章还指出：实现五年计划是一种特殊形式的阶级斗争。在“提高警惕，加强团结”的标题下，作者分析了在社会主义成份日益增长、非社会主义成份不断削弱下的阶级斗争形势，指出国内外敌人不会甘心于自己的失败，要求时刻提高警惕，同暗藏的反革命分子的破坏活动作斗争。使人们读完之后就懂得：建设社会主义是极复杂而又尖锐的阶级斗争，因而提高警惕、反对麻痹大意，为肃清一切暗藏的反革命分子而努力。
    最后，应该指出，这本书还有一些缺点，其中最主要的是对农业实行社会主义改造讲解得不够充分，作者关于合作化的问题只写了寥寥两页。对于党在农村中的阶级政策甚至没有提到。另外，阶级斗争的思想在全书里也贯串得不足。在讲到工业发展速度、轻重工业投资比例、粮食统购统销、消费品供不应求等等问题时，作者着重讲正面道理，对错误论调很少针锋相对地加以批驳。这些错误论调反映着一定阶级的看法，这许多争论实质上是阶级斗争。揭发这些争论，就使人们感受到阶级斗争的实际教育，认识到在一切战线、一切部门和一切工作岗位上都有阶级斗争。这些缺点，希望作者在再版时加以修正。
