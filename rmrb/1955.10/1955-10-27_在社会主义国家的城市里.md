The Moscow Grand Stadium Under Construction

    Near Lenin Hills in Moscow, on the Rozhnik Peninsula formed by a bend in the Moscow River, a comprehensive sports complex – the Moscow Grand Stadium – is under construction. Many powerful earthmovers are carrying out excavation work here, dumping large quantities of soil in the peninsula's low-lying areas to raise it four or five meters above the river level.

    The construction of the Grand Stadium is a massive undertaking. The construction site covers an area of 165 hectares (2,475 mu), and the technical design documents with drawings comprise 72 large volumes. Many young men and women have volunteered to participate in this construction. The Moscow Communist Youth League organization has already sent 10,000 young people there.

    This comprehensive sports complex will include a large stadium, an indoor sports hall, a handball court, and an outdoor swimming pool. The grand stadium will have 100,000 seats in the stands, and each of the others will have 13,000 to 15,000 spectator seats. In addition, there will be dozens of facilities such as soccer practice fields, tennis courts, pentathlon fields, and children's sports fields. The entire stadium's construction and equipment will be suitable for hosting the Olympic Games.

    The grand stadium resembles a huge teacup, with its stands having eighty tiers. The upper seats are covered with canopies to block the glaring sunlight and strong winds. The total length of the seats reaches forty kilometers. Beneath the stands, there will be rooms for various purposes, such as medical rooms, printing houses, press rooms, television rooms, practice halls, cinemas, restaurants, cafes, and rooms for foreign athletes to reside in. There will also be a display hall for the victories of Soviet athletes.

    Under normal circumstances, continuous rainfall would cause water to accumulate in the stadium, causing the ground to swell and hindering the competition. The Moscow Grand Stadium will have the most convenient and effective drainage system, capable of quickly draining rainwater from the field. The grand stadium is surrounded by spacious parking lots, which can accommodate six to eight thousand cars. Spectators will be able to enter the stadium through ten main gates and many smaller gates.

    This grand stadium will be completed next summer and will serve as the venue for the Soviet National Games. Nearly 10,000 outstanding athletes from the sixteen Soviet republics will compete here.
Leningrad's Underground Tram

    Leningrad's underground tramway underwent a test run on October 8th with good results. It is expected to be officially opened to traffic soon.

    The first phase of the project has a total track length of 11.8 kilometers, greatly shortening the transportation time from Leningrad's factory district to the city center. This journey would take nearly an hour by bus or tram, while the underground tram only takes 15 to 17 minutes. The current underground tramway connects Leningrad's "Baltic," "Warsaw," "Vitebsk," and "Moscow" railway stations and will eventually connect to the "Finland Station."

    Leningrad's underground tramway has eight stations, and the architectural style of each station is themed around Leningrad's past and present. For example, the "Avtovo" station, located on the front line of Leningrad's defense during the Great Patriotic War, is themed around the heroic defense at that time. The "Nava" station, located in one of Leningrad's largest industrial areas, has a simple and dignified architectural style, symbolizing the peaceful labor of the Soviet people. The architecture of the "Uprising Square" station depicts the scene of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

A Beautiful Garden City

    Alma-Ata is the capital of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. Everyone who comes here is attracted by its unique characteristics and beautiful appearance. This city at the foot of the mountains is completely immersed in a sea of green. There is not a street without shade, not a square without lush flowers and grass, and not a courtyard without a garden. If the green areas of Alma-Ata are allocated according to the population, each person can occupy almost sixty square meters on average.

    From early spring to late autumn, Alma-Ata is always full of lush foliage and blooming flowers. Countless flowerbeds and flower paths along the streets, canals, and around fountains create a beautiful picture. Abundant sunshine and fresh air give it a particularly pleasant climate.

    Alma-Ata is a relatively young city. During the Soviet era, it developed from a small provincial town into a large industrial, administrative, and cultural center. Many new factories, residential buildings, and buildings with Kazakh national styles have been constructed here. The City Soviet Building, the new building of the Republic Academy of Sciences, stadiums, cultural palaces, cinemas, and television centers are currently under construction. Alma-Ata, the garden city, is growing and prospering.

    在社会主义国家的城市里
    莫斯科大运动场在建筑中
    在莫斯科列宁山附近，由莫斯科河的河湾所形成的罗日尼克半岛上，正在兴建一座综合性的体育建筑——莫斯科大运动场。许多强大的掘土机，正在这里进行挖土工作。它们把大量的泥土倾倒在半岛的凹处，以便使它高出河面四、五公尺。
    大运动场的建设是一项巨大的工程，它的建筑现场共占地一百六十五公顷（合二千四百七十五亩），附有图纸的技术设计文件共有七十二巨卷。许许多多的男女青年都志愿参加这个建设，莫斯科共青团组织已经派了一万名青年到那里去。
    这个综合体育建筑将拥有一个大运动场，一个室内运动馆，一个手球运动场和一个露天游泳池。大运动场的看台有十万个座位，其他的每一个都设有一万三千到一万五千个观众座位。另外还有足球练习场、网球场，五项全能运动场，儿童体育场等数十个。整个运动场的建筑和设备将适合于举行国际奥林匹克运动会的需要。
    大运动场像一个庞大的茶碗一样，它的看台共有八十层，上层的座位还盖有顶棚，以便阻挡耀眼的阳光和巨风的袭击。座位的总长度达到四十公里。在看台的底下，将设有各种用途的房间，如医疗室、印刷所、新闻记者室、电视室、练习厅、电影院、饭馆、咖啡馆以及供外国运动员居住的房间等等。这里还将设立苏联运动员胜利品的陈列馆。
    在通常情况下，持续不断的雨水将使运动场积水，而使土地膨胀，妨碍比赛进行。莫斯科大运动场将有最便利有效的排水系统，能够使场地雨水很快排干。大运动场四周有广阔的停车场，可以停放六千到八千辆的汽车。观众将可以从十个大门和许多小门进入运动场。
    明年夏天这个大运动场就要建成，并作为苏联全国运动大会的场所。来自苏联十六个加盟共和国的近一万名的优秀运动员将在这里进行比赛。列宁格勒的地下电车
    列宁格勒地下电车道在十月八日试车，结果良好，预计不久就可以正式通车。
    第一部分工程的车道共长十一点八公里，它大大地缩短了列宁格勒工厂区到市中心的交通。这一段路程如果乘坐公共汽车或电车，需要近一小时，而地下电车只要十五到十七分钟就够了。现在的地下电车道连结了列宁格勒的“波罗的海”、“华沙”、“维特勃”和“莫斯科”等火车站，将来还要通到“芬兰站”。
    列宁格勒的地下电车道共有八个车站，各个车站的建筑形式的主题，都是同列宁格勒的过去和现在相关联的。例如，座落在伟大卫国战争年代中列宁格勒保卫战前线的“阿夫托沃”站，就是以当时的英勇保卫战为主题的。位于列宁格勒一个最大的工业地区的“纳瓦”站，建筑形式朴素庄严，象征着苏联人民的和平劳动。“起义广场”站的建筑中表现了伟大的十月社会主义革命的情景。列宁格勒地下电车道一个车站的地下大厅美丽的花园城市
    阿拉木图是哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国的首都。每一个来到这里的人，都会为它的特点和美丽的面貌所吸引。这个位于高山脚下的城市完全沉浸在一片绿色的海洋中。这里没有一条街道没有林荫，没有一个广场不是花草茂盛，没有一座院子里没有花园。阿拉木图的绿化区如果按居民的人口来分配，平均每一个人几乎可以占到六十平方公尺。
    从初春到深秋，阿拉木图一直是浓荫处处，鲜花盛开的。沿着街道、水渠和围着喷泉的无数花坛和花道，构成了一幅绮丽的图画。充足的阳光，清新的空气，使这里具有特别宜人的气候。
    阿拉木图是一个比较年轻的城市。在苏维埃政权的年代里，它才从一个不大的省城发展成为一个巨大的工业、行政和文化中心。这里已经建设了许多新的工厂、住宅和各种具有哈萨克民族风格的建筑物。现在正在兴建市苏维埃大厦、共和国科学院的新楼、运动场、文化宫、电影院和电视中心。阿拉木图，这个花园的城市，正在成长着，繁荣着。
