    A New Beginning for Sino-Japanese Cultural Exchange
    Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries

    The Japanese Kabuki Troupe, headed by Kunizo Matsuo and Ennosuke Ichikawa, arrived in Beijing yesterday. Our cultural circles and people are excited to have the opportunity to appreciate the performance of the Japanese Kabuki Troupe, visiting our country for the first time in history, as we celebrate the sixth anniversary of our National Day. This is of great significance for Sino-Japanese cultural exchange.
    The Japanese Kabuki Troupe's visit to China for performances is arranged according to the agreement reached on August 22nd this year in Beijing between Mr. Kunizo Matsuo, representative of the Japanese Grand Kabuki Company, and Mr. Jiichiro Matsumoto, President of the Japan-China Friendship Association, representing Mr. Tomio Narasaki, and representatives of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. The purpose of the above agreement is to promote cultural exchange between the people of China and Japan through the exchange of theatrical arts performances; the agreement also specifically stipulates that following the Japanese Kabuki Troupe's visit to China, the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe will visit Japan for performances in April and May 1956. Now, the Japanese Kabuki Troupe has undertaken the task of cultural envoys of the Japanese people and come before the Chinese people; we sincerely welcome them and congratulate them on completing this glorious task. At the same time, we firmly believe that through the exchange of performances by the two countries' troupes, the cultural circles and people of the two countries will become closer in thought and emotion, thereby contributing to friendship and unity between them.
    Kabuki is a representative Japanese classical theatrical art. It integrates various ancient Japanese folk arts, and after a long period of development, it has gradually become a beautiful drama with national traditions and folk colors. The growth process of Kabuki is closely linked to the historical development of Japanese society. It has been repeatedly suppressed and devastated by feudal rulers and discriminated against by the so-called upper class; however, with the support of the broad masses of the people, it has finally broken through layers of obstacles and continued to develop, and it is still popular among the masses. There is no doubt that Japanese patriotic artists will continue to defend and develop their national art traditions, and the beautiful theatrical art of Kabuki will shine with new brilliance in the cultural life of the Japanese people.
    The Japanese Kabuki Troupe enjoys a very good reputation in Japan, and its main actors, such as Ennosuke Ichikawa, enjoy international prestige. The troupe is preparing to perform several of its best plays in our country, such as "Kanjincho" (The Subscription List), "Stuttering Yanosuke" and "Spring-Colored Love Suicide at Dojoji Temple". These plays are not only well-known in Japan for their high artistic level, but also because they reflect the Japanese people's tradition of justice, courage to resist old forces, and the spirit of freedom and excellent qualities, and have always been sincerely welcomed by the majority of the audience.
    According to the introduction of Japanese playwrights, Kabuki has successively absorbed the essence of folk arts passed down from China in its development process, so even today there are still some similarities with Peking Opera in terms of makeup and performance techniques. This feature will be of great interest to our art circles and audiences. We believe that our people will appreciate the performances of Japanese Kabuki with sympathetic understanding, and our art circles will learn something from the Kabuki Troupe and exchange experiences with it.
    The cultural connection between the Chinese and Japanese people has almost never been interrupted for two thousand years. The mutual influence of the two cultures is both deep and far-reaching. Their historical origins are still evident in various aspects such as writing, religion, customs, and science and art. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, Japan sent a large number of students to China to study and introduce Chinese culture to Japan. After the Meiji Restoration in Japan, Chinese students also went to Japan to explore modern culture. Some of these outstanding representatives made great contributions to the New Culture Movement in China after returning to China. This spirit of mutual learning is very valuable for the exchange and enrichment of Chinese and Japanese cultures, and we should continue to promote it.
    History proves that cultural exchange can be well developed between countries with different social systems. In the cultural field, all nations equally occupy their own glorious position and make their own unique contributions to the treasure house of human culture. Cultural exchange is one of the best ways to enrich the cultures of all countries and promote mutual friendship among the people of all countries. The traditional friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people is inseparable from Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. In the past sixty years, as a result of Japanese imperialism's policy of aggression against China, two wars have occurred between China and Japan, which have seriously hindered the development of friendship and cultural exchange between the two peoples. This huge loss must be made up for by the people and cultural circles of China and Japan today.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the new conditions of rapid development of our cultural construction and the importance attached to cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries by our government and people, Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges could have been quickly restored and moved towards a new climax. In the past six years, due to the joint efforts of the people and cultural circles of China and Japan, and due to the active assistance of the Chinese government, Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges have achieved certain development. On the Japanese side, the Japan-China Friendship Association, whose main purpose is to devote itself to cultural exchange, was established as early as October 1, 1950. This association has gained widespread support from the Japanese cultural circles and people, and has made significant achievements in promoting mutual contact and exchange of information between the cultural circles of China and Japan. The Japanese cultural circles and the broad masses of the people are particularly interested in the culture and art of New China. They eagerly hope to see more of our films, stage our dramas, translate and read our literary works, and hold exhibitions introducing our culture. Their ardent desire to understand New China should be satisfied.
    The cultural circles and people of New China have great respect for and concern for Japanese culture. In recent years, we have received many friends from Japanese cultural circles to visit our country, including well-known scientists and professors, outstanding writers and artists, as well as journalists and religious figures. At this time last year, the Japanese Academic and Cultural Delegation to China, headed by Professor Yoshishige Abe, participated in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing, and later visited various places. During their visit, they not only established friendly contacts with Chinese cultural figures, but also introduced the current situation of Japanese culture through seminars and other activities, and made some valuable comments on our work in various aspects; after returning to China, they reported their impressions of the visit to the Japanese people and conveyed the friendship of the Chinese people. This kind of visit is of great benefit to cultural exchange. In addition, we also introduce Japanese culture in various ways. For example, from 1950 to recently, we have held Japanese woodcut exhibitions three times; the latest exhibition will be touring seven major cities across the country. The number of Japanese books translated and published in our country since liberation, as of June 1955, has reached 250, with a total of 1.39 million copies printed. The latest published famous Japanese literary works such as "The Crab Cannery Ship", "Quiet Mountains", "Japanese Workers" and classical works "Selected Japanese Kyogen" have been warmly welcomed by our vast readers. At the same time, our audiences are deeply moved by excellent Japanese films such as "A Female Miner", "No, We Want to Live!" and "Mulatto". From these cultural and artistic activities, the Chinese people have seen the life, anger and struggle of the Japanese people. The Chinese and Japanese people stand firmly together in the struggle to defend peace in the Far East and the world. They unanimously demand to create their own happy life and promote the progress of mankind through the path of peace, culture and friendship. They are moving towards this goal.
    Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges have not been without difficulties and obstacles in recent years. However, with the general demands and efforts of the people of China and Japan, especially the Japanese people, these difficulties and obstacles will gradually be overcome. After the Asian-African Conference, cultural cooperation among Eastern countries has been widely advocated and supported, and Sino-Japanese cultural exchange should also show a new atmosphere. We sincerely hope that this visit and performance of the Japanese Kabuki Troupe to our country will become a new beginning. In the future, the contacts and cooperation between the cultural circles of the two countries will make more contributions to the friendly unity of the people of China and Japan and the normalization of relations between the two countries.
    I wish the Japanese Kabuki Troupe a successful performance in China!
    I wish the friendly relations and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese people will continue to develop and consolidate!

    中日文化交流的新开端  
    中国人民对外文化协会副会长  阳翰笙
    以松尾国三、市川猿之助为首的日本歌舞伎剧团已于昨天到达北京。我国文化界和人民在庆祝六周年国庆之际，有机会欣赏历史上第一次来我国访问的日本歌舞伎剧团的表演，这是令人兴奋的事。这对于中日文化交流具有重大的意义。
    日本歌舞伎剧团这次来我国访问演出，是根据日本大歌舞伎一座代表松尾国三先生和日中友好协会会长松本治一郎先生代表楢崎富男先生同中国人民对外文化协会代表于今年八月二十二日在北京达成的协议安排的。上述协议的宗旨是通过戏剧艺术的交换演出以促进中日两国人民的文化交流；协议中并具体规定，随着日本歌舞伎剧团访华之后，中国京剧团将于一九五六年四、五月间赴日本访问演出。现在日本歌舞伎剧团已肩负起日本人民文化使者的任务来到了中国人民面前；我们热诚地欢迎它，并祝贺它完成这一光荣的任务。同时，我们深信，通过两国剧团的交换演出，将使两国文化界和两国人民在思想情感上更加接近，因而有助于彼此间的友好团结。
    歌舞伎是一种具有代表性的日本古典戏剧艺术。它综合了日本古代各种民间艺术，经过长时期的发展，逐渐成为具有民族传统和民间色彩的优美的戏剧。歌舞伎的成长过程是同日本社会的历史发展密切地结合的。它曾经屡次受到封建统治者的压抑和摧残，受到所谓上流社会的歧视；但是在广大人民的支持下，它终于突破层层障碍，不断地发展着，迄今犹为群众所喜闻乐见。毫无疑问，日本的爱国艺术家们将继续卫护和发展自己的民族艺术传统，歌舞伎这一优美的戏剧艺术也将在日本人民的文化生活中发出新的光辉。
    日本歌舞伎剧团在日本国内拥有很好的声誉，其中主要演员市川猿之助等是享有国际声望的。剧团准备在我国演出几个最优秀的剧目，如“劝进帐”（化缘簿）、“口吃的又平”和“春色男女道成寺”等。这些剧目在日本不仅由于高度的艺术水平久已脍炙人口，而且因为它们反映了日本人民富于正义感、勇于反抗旧势力和崇尚自由的传统精神与优良品质，始终受到广大观众的由衷的欢迎。
    根据日本戏剧家们的介绍，歌舞伎在其发展过程中曾陆续汲收从中国传去的民间艺术的精华，因此直到今天在化装和表现手法等方面还有某些同京剧相似的地方。这一特点将使我国艺术界和观众感到很大的兴趣。我们相信，我国人民将怀着同情的理解来欣赏日本歌舞伎的演出，我国艺术界将向歌舞伎剧团学到一些东西，并与之交流经验。
    中国人民和日本人民之间的文化联系，两千年来几乎从未间断。两国文化的相互影响是既深且远的。它们之间的历史渊源关系，至今还明显地表现在文字、宗教、风俗习惯和科学、文艺等各个方面。隋唐时代日本曾派遣大批留学生来中国学习、将中国文化介绍到日本去。日本明治维新后中国学生也纷纷东渡，向日本探取近代文化。其中一些卓越的代表人物，回国以后对中国新文化运动作了很大的贡献。这种相互求教的精神对于中日两国文化的交流和丰富是很可贵的，我们应该继续发扬。
    历史证明，文化交流是完全可以在不同社会制度的国家之间得到很好的发展的。在文化领域中，一切民族都平等地占有它自己的光荣地位，并且对人类文化宝库各自作出独特的贡献。文化交流就是丰富各国文化、促进各国人民相互友好的最好途径之一。中日两国人民的传统友谊是同中日文化交流分不开的。最近六十年内，由于日本帝国主义对华侵略政策的结果，中日两国之间发生过两次战争，严重地阻碍了两国人民的友谊和文化交流的发展，这一巨大损失是今天中日两国人民和文化界所必须竭力弥补的。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，在我国文化建设事业迅速发展和我国政府与人民重视中外文化交流的新的条件下，中日文化交流本来可以很快地恢复并走向一个新的高潮。六年来，由于中日两国人民和文化界的共同努力，由于中国政府的积极协助，中日文化交流有了一定的发展。在日本方面，早在一九五○年十月一日就成立了以致力于文化交流为主要宗旨之一的日中友好协会。这个协会获得日本文化界和人民的广泛支持，在促进中日两国文化界相互接触和交换资料等工作中有了显著的成就。日本文化界和广大人民对于新中国的文化艺术特别感到兴趣，他们热烈地希望看到更多的我国电影，上演我国戏剧，翻译和阅读我国的文艺作品，举办介绍我国文化的展览会。他们这种要了解新中国的热烈愿望，应该得到满足。
    新中国的文化界和人民是十分尊重和关心日本文化的。几年以来我们接待了日本文化界的许多朋友来我国访问，其中有著名的科学家和教授，有优秀的作家和艺术家，也有新闻记者和宗教界人士。去年这时候，以安倍能成教授为首的日本学术文化访华代表团在北京参加了中华人民共和国成立五周年庆祝会，后来又赴各地参观，他们在访问中不但同我国文化界人士建立了友谊联系，而且通过座谈会等活动介绍了日本文化的现况，并对我国各方面的工作提了一些宝贵的意见；回去以后他们又向日本人民报道了访华观感，传达了中国人民的友情。这种访问对于文化交流是有很大益处的。此外，我们还以种种方式介绍日本文化。例如从一九五○年到最近，我们曾三次举办日本木刻展览会；最近这次展览将在全国七大城市巡回展出。我国解放后翻译出版的日本书籍，截至一九五五年六月已达二百五十种，共印行一百三十九万册。最新出版的日本文学名著如“蟹工船”、“静静的群山”、“日本劳动者”及古典作品“日本狂言选”等，受到我国广大读者的热烈欢迎。同时我国观众以深深的同情欣赏着优秀的日本影片，如“一个女矿工”、“不，我们要活下去！”和“混血儿”等等。从这些文化艺术活动中，中国人民看到了日本人民的生活、愤怒和斗争。中日两国人民在保卫远东和世界和平的斗争中坚决地站在一起。他们一致要求通过和平、文化和友谊的道路，来创造自己的幸福生活和促进人类的进步。他们正在朝着这个目标前进。
    几年以来中日文化交流不是没有遇到困难和障碍的。但是在中日两国人民、首先是日本人民的普遍要求和努力下，这些困难和障碍必将逐渐得以克服。亚非会议以后，东方各国之间的文化合作获得了广泛的倡导和支持，中日文化交流也该出现新的气象。我们热诚地希望这次日本歌舞伎剧团来我国的访问演出成为一个新的开端。今后两国文化界的联系合作将为中日两国人民的友好团结和两国关系的正常化，作出更多的贡献。
    祝日本歌舞伎剧团在中国演出成功！
    祝中日两国人民的友好关系和文化交流不断地发展和巩固！
