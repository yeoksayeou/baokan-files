    Farmers in Various Regions Eagerly Purchase Two-Wheel Two-Bottom Plows
    (Our Dispatch) Since the beginning of autumn, farmers in various regions have been enthusiastically purchasing new-style agricultural implements such as two-wheel two-bottom plows. After Shandong Province's Zhucheng County announced a 40% price reduction for two-wheel two-bottom plows, all seventy of the existing two-bottom plows were sold out in two days, and a request was made for an additional one hundred plows. In Huimin County, the agricultural production cooperative chairmen's meeting resulted in the sale of 500 two-bottom plows at once. In addition to completing the planned sales of 10,000 two-bottom plows, the Liaocheng Special District is preparing to increase the number by 2,000. In the first ten days of September, supply and marketing cooperatives in 24 counties of the Xinxiang, Xuchang, and Anyang Special Districts of Henan Province signed supply contracts with agricultural production cooperatives for more than 6,000 two-bottom plows, accounting for 25% of the aforementioned regions' promotion tasks for the second half of the year. In the dry land areas of Jiangsu, the Xuzhou Special District has supplied farmers with more than 2,700 two-bottom plows in the month and a half since August, an increase of one-third compared to the first half of the year. Counties such as Xinyi, Fengxian, and Ganyu have either nearly completed or exceeded their promotion tasks. In Hebei Province, more than 13,000 two-bottom plows were sold in the month and a half from the beginning of August to September 10th, more than three times the number sold in the first seven months of this year; vigorous promotion continues, and it is expected that the province's promotion target of more than 60,000 plows can be completed soon. In addition to being able to complete the annual plan of 20,000 plows, Shanxi Province has also requested an increase of 7,000 plows. Counties in Heilongjiang Province are requesting an increase of more than 30% over the original plan.
    Since the Second National Agricultural Implement Conference in July of this year, all regions have adopted active measures to promote new-style agricultural implements. Under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, industrial, agricultural, supply and marketing, and handicraft departments in various regions have cooperated closely to jointly study and solve problems. All regions have also made appropriate adjustments and revisions to their promotion plans to make the plans more practical and increase the confidence of cadres in completing their tasks. Generally, leading organs in various regions attach great importance to this work and have designated specific personnel to be responsible for resolutely completing the task of promoting 400,000 two-wheel two-bottom plows and two-wheel single-bottom plows this year, and laying the foundation for promoting 500,000 units in 1956.

    各地农民踊跃购买双轮双铧犁
    本报讯入秋以来，各地农民踊跃购买双轮双铧犁等新式农具。山东省诸城县在双轮双铧犁降价百分之四十的消息公布后，两天内将现存七十部双铧犁全部卖完，并要求再增加一百部。惠民县在农业生产合作社社长会议上，一次就推销了双铧犁五百部。聊城专区除完成推销一万部双铧犁计划外，准备再增加两千部。河南省新乡、许昌、安阳三个专区有二十四个县的供销合作社，在九月份的头十天中，就和农业生产合作社订立了六千多部双铧犁的供应合同，占上述地区下半年推广任务的百分之二十五。江苏旱田地区的徐州专区，从八月以来的一个多月中，已供应农民双铧犁二千七百多部，比上半年增加了三分之一。新沂、丰县、赣榆等县已接近或超额完成了推广任务。河北省从八月初到九月十日的一个多月内推售了双铧犁一万三千多部，相当于今年头七个月的三倍多；现在继续大力推广，预计全省六万多部推销任务可在最近完成。山西省除能完成全年计划两万部外，还要求增加七千部。黑龙江各县要求增加原计划的百分之三十以上。
    从今年七月第二次全国农具会议以后，各地对推广新式农具工作都采取了积极措施。在各级党委统一领导下，各地工业、农业、供销和手工业等部门通力协作，共同研究问题和解决问题。各地对推广计划也作了适当调整和修正，使计划更切合实际，增加了干部完成任务的信心。各地领导机关对这一工作一般都很重视，并确定专人负责，坚决完成今年推广双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁四十万部的任务，并为一九五六年推广五十万部打下基础。
