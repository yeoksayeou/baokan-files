Xinhua News Agency, Sinŭiju, October 10th – Starting today, Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) troops returning home began withdrawing from Korea via Sinŭiju. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) stationed in Sinŭiju inspected 2,844 CPV personnel and their accompanying weapons and ammunition who were withdrawing from Korea on two trains this morning and afternoon.

The NNSC received full cooperation and assistance from the Korean and Chinese sides during the inspection. The liaison officers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed at the Sinŭiju rear port notified the NNSC in writing the arrival time, number of personnel, and classified figures for the weapons and ammunition being taken out of the country for each batch of departing military personnel the night before the train arrived.

At 9:30 AM (Pyongyang time) on the morning of the 10th, the first train carrying returning CPV troops entered Sinŭiju Station. A group consisting of the Swiss member, who served as the executive chairman of the NNSC that day, and a Polish member conducted the inspection. They inspected the military personnel in each carriage and randomly checked the weapons and ammunition they were carrying. They did not raise any discrepancies in the figures. At 10:35 AM (Pyongyang time), the Swiss member serving as the executive chairman announced the end of the inspection of this train. In the afternoon of the 10th, a group composed of the Swiss member and the Polish member inspected the second train carrying CPV troops withdrawing from Korea that day. They entered each carriage for inspection, checking the number of returning personnel and weapons and ammunition. The results were in complete agreement with the figures in the written materials provided to the NNSC by the liaison officers of the Korean and Chinese sides.
