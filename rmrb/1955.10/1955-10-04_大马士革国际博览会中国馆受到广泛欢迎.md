    The Chinese Pavilion at the Damascus International Fair in Syria was widely welcomed by visitors during the exhibition period from September 1st to 30th.

    The new and sophisticated machines and other heavy industrial products produced in China particularly aroused great interest among the audience. A large number of spectators watched the demonstrations of these machines in operation every day. Many viewers also inquired in detail about the specifications and performance of these machines, as well as the situation of China's industrial construction. The audience expressed surprise and joy at the achievements of such industrial construction in a country that was still suffering from oppression and exploitation not long ago. A Syrian viewer wrote in the comments book: "The achievements of China's industrial construction prove the great strength of the Chinese people. It also proves that Eastern countries are able to get rid of imperialist control and industrialize their countries." Another viewer said: "I am proud to see an Asian country producing so many new machines. I hope that economic and cultural cooperation between China and the Arab world will develop rapidly."

    Various light industrial products exhibited in the Chinese Pavilion also won enthusiastic praise from the audience. Many viewers waited at the door, striving to buy various Chinese products as early as possible. Business at the retail counters was very good at all times. Women viewers were particularly fond of the gorgeous and colorful Chinese silks and printed fabrics. Many viewers said that these inexpensive and high-quality products show that the living standards of the Chinese people are gradually improving.

    Viewers also loved the world-famous Chinese porcelain, ivory carvings, and other handicrafts that have been imported into Arab countries since ancient times. Many viewers said that after seeing these Chinese products, we felt intimately that our old friendship was being restored and growing.

    The newly printed Chinese Qurans, Bibles, other religious classics, and pictures about Chinese religious life have been particularly noticed by Arab viewers who believe in Islam. They said that these exhibits exposed the lies of the imperialists and clearly illustrate that religion is protected and respected in China.

    Viewers also expressed their fervent hope to strengthen friendly relations with the Chinese people who have stood up. Every day, many viewers take pictures in front of the giant statue of Chairman Mao. Many viewers hope that the Chinese people will make greater achievements in economic construction. They said that the achievements of the Chinese people have strengthened their confidence in defending independence, freedom and peace.

    中国新印刷的可兰经、圣经、其他宗教的经典和有关中国宗教生活的图片特别受到信仰伊斯兰教的阿拉伯观众的注意。他们说，这些展品揭露了帝国主义者的谎言，并且清楚地说明在中国宗教是受到保护和尊重的。
    观众们还表示他们热烈希望同站立起来了的中国人民加强友好关系。每天，都有许多观众在毛主席的巨像前面拍照。许多观众希望中国人民在经济建设方面取得更大的成就。他们说，中国人民的成就加强了他们保卫独立、自由和和平的信心。
