Xinhua News Agency, October 23rd: On September 27th, Italian Foreign Minister Martino announced to the Italian Chamber of Deputies that the Italian government representative in Geneva had contacted the Chinese government representative on the issue of promoting the normalization of relations between China and Italy and expanding trade between the two countries. The reporter learned from authoritative sources that Mr. Feliu, the Italian representative in Geneva, had been instructed by the Italian government to contact Ambassador Wang Bingnan, who is currently in Geneva representing our country. Ambassador Wang Bingnan expressed to Mr. Feliu the Chinese government's views on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Italy and the expansion of economic and cultural exchanges.

According to authoritative sources, the Chinese government has always been willing to develop trade with all countries based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and therefore welcomes the Italian government's expressed desire to develop Sino-Italian trade. The Chinese government suggests that while the Chinese and Italian governments discuss expanding trade between the two countries, negotiations should also be held on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Because it is clear that only when China and Italy have established diplomatic relations can economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries be further developed, and can the wishes of the people of both countries be fully met.

    就促进两国关系正常化和扩大贸易问题
    意大利代表同我国代表在日内瓦进行接触
    新华社二十三日讯　九月二十七日意大利外交部长马蒂诺向意大利议会下议院宣布，意大利政府驻日内瓦代表同中国政府代表就促进中意两国关系正常化和扩大两国贸易问题进行了接触。记者从权威方面获悉，意大利驻日内瓦代表费利奥先生曾奉意大利政府的指示同我国现在日内瓦的王炳南大使进行过接触。王炳南大使向费利奥先生表示了中国政府关于中意两国建立外交关系和扩大经济文化交流的意见。
    据权威方面指出，中国政府一向愿意根据平等互利的原则同各国发展贸易，因此欢迎意大利政府关于发展中意贸易所表示的愿望。中国政府建议，在中意两国政府商谈扩大两国贸易的同时，谈判两国建立外交关系的问题。因为，很显然，只有中意两国建立了外交关系，才能使两国之间的经济和文化交流有更大的发展，也才能够充分地满足两国人民的愿望。
