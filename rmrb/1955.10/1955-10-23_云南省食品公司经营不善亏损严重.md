To the Editor:

    The Yunnan Provincial Food Company's poor management has caused alarming losses to the state. According to preliminary statistics, in the year from its establishment last May to this summer, the company lost over 13,000 head of live pigs alone. Currently, 20% of its stockpiled shrimp and squid have become moldy and deteriorated. A batch of purchased lard was downgraded and sold off, totaling 32,000 jin, due to lax inspection standards. 200,000 jin of preserved meat has already gone bad. In the first half of this year, the company suffered a total loss of 350,000 yuan. As of now, the losses have not stopped.

    The company's management is extremely chaotic. Last winter, it requested its branches in Qujing and Chuxiong to purchase large quantities of live pigs, but lacked the necessary management personnel and pig pens. As a result, the pigs were left on the streets, in alleys, on roadside grasslands, and in open fields. Many pigs froze to death, starved to death, died of illness, or went missing.

    The company also suffers from serious capitalist business practices. In pursuit of profit, they blindly purchased goods from other provinces and signed large purchase contracts, while failing to properly arrange procurement within the province. Yunnan Province can be self-sufficient in pork and egg products, but the food company purchased hundreds of thousands of jin of preserved meat and hundreds of thousands of eggs and preserved eggs from Guizhou. These goods resulted in huge losses due to lack of sales and poor storage. For example, of the 58,000 eggs transferred from Guizhou in January of this year, 93% were lost due to prolonged storage in warehouses.

    I believe that the Yunnan Provincial Department of Commerce should inspect and rectify the company's management.

### 云南省食品公司经营不善亏损严重

    云南省食品公司经营不善亏损严重编辑同志：
    云南省食品公司经营管理不善，给国家造成了惊人的损失。根据初步统计，这个公司从去年五月成立到今年夏季的一年中，仅毛猪就死亡了一万三千多头；目前库存的虾仁、鱿鱼已有百分之二十生霉变质；采购的一批猪油由于验收不严，有三万二千斤降等出售；有二十万斤腊肉已经变了味。今年上半年，这个公司一共亏损了三十五万元。到现在，亏损现象并没有停止。
    这个公司的经营管理十分混乱，去年冬天，要曲靖、楚雄等地支公司收购大批毛猪，可是没有必要的管理人员，又没有猪圈，只得把猪放在大街小巷、路边草坝和旷野里，很多毛猪冻死、饿死、病死和失踪了。
    这个公司的资本主义经营思想也很严重。他们为了贪图利润，盲目到省外购货，签订大批购货合同，而对省内各地区的收购工作却不作妥善安排。云南省的猪肉、蛋品是可以自给的，但是食品公司却向贵州购买了几十万斤腊肉、几十万个鸡蛋和皮蛋。这些货物由于销不出去和保管不好，造成了巨大的损失。如今年一月从贵州调来的五万八千个鸡蛋，在仓库里存放时间过长，竟损失了百分之九十三。
    我认为，云南省商业厅应该检查和整顿这个公司的经营管理工作。
