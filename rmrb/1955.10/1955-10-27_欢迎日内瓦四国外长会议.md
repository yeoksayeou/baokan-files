    Welcome to the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference
    The Four Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France opens in Geneva today. Its task is to continue discussing and proposing concrete solutions to certain major international issues, according to the instructions of the four heads of government, in order to consolidate peace and international security. This conference is a major effort by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to further seek to ease international tensions. The Four Power Summit created the Geneva spirit and mobilized all peace-loving countries and peoples around the world to work for international understanding, trust, and cooperation. International tensions have therefore eased significantly. It is entirely proper for the people of the world to demand that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference follow the "Geneva spirit" and continue to move forward.
    According to the instructions of the Four Power Summit, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will discuss the issues of disarmament, European security and the German question, and the development of contacts between East and West. The current international situation, especially the new developments in the international situation since the Four Power Summit, has created favorable conditions for discussing these issues and reaching agreements that everyone can accept.
    On the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, things are moving in a favorable direction, regardless of the situation at the conference table. The Soviet Union's action to reduce its armed forces by 640,000 and abandon its military bases in Finland is a harbinger. People's democracies have also taken exemplary actions in reducing their armed forces. Britain has announced its readiness to cut its armed forces by about 100,000. According to reports from Western news agencies, Greece and Canada are also considering reducing military spending; Greece's reductions could reach 11 percent of the military budget.
    This situation makes the lack of progress in the negotiations of the United Nations Disarmament Commission's Subcommittee incomprehensible. Everyone knows that, thanks to the Soviet Union's proposal of May 10, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France have come close on the basic components of the disarmament issue, such as the absolute number of armed forces of major countries and the phased prohibition of atomic bombs. Therefore, it is entirely possible to affirm what everyone has approached and gradually lead the progress of the disarmament issue to the end of the arms race. However, on the one hand, the US representative expressed "reservations" about the attitude taken in the past on the issue of measures to reduce armaments and prohibit atomic weapons; on the other hand, it was only willing to discuss the United States' so-called aerial inspection and supervision proposal. In this way, it actually embarked on the road of refusing to make decisions on these major issues. Recently, because the United States was afraid that many countries in the United Nations would express opinions different from its methods on the disarmament issue, it opposed the Soviet Union's proposal to submit the disarmament issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion, saying that this issue would be discussed at the Foreign Ministers Conference. However, on the eve of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the United States once again belittled the importance of the disarmament issue in the Foreign Ministers Conference in propaganda, claiming that this issue is "basically the responsibility of the United Nations and its Disarmament Subcommittee." The United States' self-contradictory attitude of evading discussion of the disarmament issue makes people doubt whether it is willing to disarm. This attitude is not in line with the Geneva spirit, and it should not continue in the Foreign Ministers Conference.
    The Geneva spirit also requires constructive progress in the establishment of a European collective security system to consolidate peace in Europe and the world, and to promote the solution of the German question. This is a practical way to prevent the Paris Agreement from endangering European security and obstructing German reunification. This is also the Soviet Union's proposition. It should be said that the spirit of the Four Power Summit's instructions to the Foreign Ministers Conference also lies in this. But the United States wants to use West Germany to merge with East Germany and pull the merged Germany into the North Atlantic Group. Insisting on this approach will of course obstruct the Foreign Ministers Conference. In fact, more and more people are advocating the maintenance of European peace through the establishment of a pan-European collective security system, thereby seeking German reunification. West German Social Democratic Party member of parliament Metzger once said: "The Social Democratic Party wants to urge the federal government and Western countries to abolish the Paris Agreement and seek a solution to the problem within a collective security system plan." The former head of the West German "Blank Department"'s planning department's proposal on Germany maintaining neutrality and direct negotiations between East and West Germany has also received widespread support. This is an issue that representatives of Western countries participating in the Foreign Ministers Conference cannot ignore.
    The issues of European security and German reunification are closely related to the vital interests of all German people. Solving the issue of German reunification is especially a matter for all Germans themselves. Therefore, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference cannot ignore the existence of the two Germanys and discuss the German question behind the backs of any part of the German people. German Democratic Republic Prime Minister Grotewohl clearly stated that the German Democratic Republic is ready to participate in a pan-European collective security system including all European countries before the establishment of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, and hopes and expects the Federal Republic of Germany to change its policy and agree to participate in the aforementioned security system, thereby creating the prerequisites for the establishment of a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany. There is no doubt that the German Democratic Republic's position is conducive to consolidating peace in Europe and promoting the solution of the German question.
    The progress of the Geneva spirit in increasing East-West contacts is obvious to all. After the Four Power Summit, exchanges and contacts between governments and people of various countries have greatly increased. These contacts provide opportunities for government personnel, parliamentarians, and people from all walks of life to communicate their opinions and feelings and understand each other's common interests. Trade exchanges between countries are also expanding. The bustling East-West exchanges that have taken place under the impetus of the Geneva spirit in recent months are dissolving the tense atmosphere caused by the "Cold War." This proves that developing East-West contacts to strengthen and consolidate peace is a road with broad prospects. People have reason to expect further achievements in this regard at the Foreign Ministers Conference.
    It should be pointed out that there are still many difficulties on the road to consolidating and promoting the Geneva spirit. Some forces in the United States who believe that only tension is profitable have long regarded the achievements of the Geneva spirit as their "disaster." Some powerful figures in the United States have continuously delivered speeches against the Geneva spirit. Many newspapers in the United States have attacked the Geneva spirit in every possible way and openly asserted that "the Geneva spirit has become a thing of the past." Some of the most stubborn enemies of international cooperation have even openly launched a "movement against the Geneva spirit" and demanded the restoration of the "Cold War." All these situations show that some people are trying to make the development of the international situation deviate from the track of the Geneva spirit, especially to create a bad atmosphere for the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, so that this conference will achieve nothing.
    Therefore, the Geneva spirit is putting the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to the test. The Chinese people, like the peace-loving people of the world, sincerely hope for the success of the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Any achievement of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will contribute to further easing international tensions and consolidating world peace. Since the Foreign Ministers Conference still faces difficulties, all peace-loving people must make efforts from all aspects to promote the Geneva spirit, combat all remarks and actions that violate the Geneva spirit, and promote the conference to achieve positive results.

### 欢迎日内瓦四国外长会议

    欢迎日内瓦四国外长会议
    苏美英法四国外长会议今天在日内瓦开幕了。它的任务是根据四国政府首脑的指示，继续讨论和提出某些重大国际问题的具体解决办法，以巩固和平和国际安全。这次会议是苏美英法进一步谋求和缓国际紧张局势的一个重大的努力。四国政府首脑会议创造了日内瓦精神，动员了全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民为谋求国际谅解、信任和合作而努力。国际紧张局势已因此有了显著的缓和。世界人民要求四国外长会议遵循“日内瓦精神”继续前进，这是完全正当的。
    按照四国政府首脑会议的指示，四国外长会议将讨论裁军问题、欧洲安全和德国问题以及发展东西方之间的接触的问题。目前的国际形势，特别是四国政府首脑会议以来的国际局势的新发展，已为讨论这些问题，并达成大家都能接受的协议，造成了有利的条件。
    在裁军和禁止原子武器问题上，不管会议桌上的情形是怎样，事情正在朝着有利的方向发展。苏联裁减武装部队六十四万人，并且放弃在芬兰的军事基地的行动是一个先声。各人民民主国家在裁减武装部队方面也都采取了示范行动。英国宣布准备裁军约十万人。比利时议会关于国防预算的报告说，比利时将在明年把它的三个现役师军队裁减为两个师。根据西方通讯社的消息，希腊和加拿大也在考虑削减军事费用；希腊削减的数字可达军事预算的百分之十一。
    这种情形使联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的谈判缺乏进展的情况，显得不可理解。人人都知道，由于苏联五月十日提出的建议，苏联和美、英、法之间已经在裁军问题的基本构成部分，例如主要国家武装部队的绝对数字和禁止原子弹分阶段等问题上都接近了，因此，完全有可能把大家已经接近之点肯定下来，使裁军问题的进展逐渐导致军备竞赛的结束。然而，美国代表却一方面在有关裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施的问题上，表示“保留”过去所采取的态度；另一方面，它又只肯讨论美国的所谓空中视察监督的建议。这样，它实际上走上了在这些重大问题上拒绝作出决定的道路。最近，美国因为害怕联合国许多国家在裁军问题上表示与它的办法不同的意见，竟反对苏联将裁军问题提交联合国大会讨论的建议，说是因为这个问题将在外长会议上讨论。但是，到了外长会议前夕，美国又在宣传上贬低裁军问题在外长会议中的重要性，声称这个问题“基本上是联合国及其裁军小组委员会的责任”。美国这种自相矛盾、躲避讨论裁军问题的态度，使人怀疑它究竟肯不肯裁军。这种态度不符合日内瓦精神，它不应该在外长会议中继续下去。
    日内瓦精神也要求在建立欧洲集体安全体系方面求得建设性的进展，以巩固欧洲和世界的和平，并促进德国问题的解决。为了不让巴黎协定危害欧洲的安全并阻挠德国的统一，这是一个切实可行的办法。这也是苏联的主张。应该说，四国首脑会议给外长会议指示的精神也在于此。但是美国却想用西德来合并东德，并把合并的德国拉进北大西洋集团。坚持这种做法当然就会对外长会议发生阻挠作用。事实上，主张通过建立全欧集体安全体系来维护欧洲和平，从而谋求德国统一的人越来越多了。西德社会民主党议员麦茨格尔就曾说：“社会民主党要促使联邦政府和西方国家取消巴黎协定，而在一个集体安全体系计划内求得问题的解决。”前西德“布兰克部”计划处处长关于德国保持中立，并由东西德直接谈判的主张也得到了广泛的支持。这是西方国家参加外长会议的代表们不能不注意的问题。
    欧洲安全和德国统一问题同全体德国人民都有切身利害的关系。解决德国统一问题尤其是全体德国人自己的事情。因此，四国外长会议就不能忽视两个德国的存在，而背着任何一部分德国人来谈德国问题。德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥明确表示，德意志民主共和国准备在建成一个统一、和平和民主的德国之前参加包括一切欧洲国家在内的全欧集体安全体系，并且希望和期待德意志联邦共和国改变政策而同意参加上述的安全体系，从而为建立一个和平、民主和统一的德国创造前提。毫无疑问，德意志民主共和国的这种立场是有利于巩固欧洲的和平和促进德国问题的解决的。
    日内瓦精神在增进东西方接触的方面的进展是人所共见的。在四国政府首脑会议之后，各国政府之间和人民之间的往来和接触是大大增加了。这些接触，使各国政府人员、议会人士和各行各业的人们都有机会沟通意见和感情，了解彼此的共同利益。各国之间贸易往来也正在扩大。几个月来在日内瓦精神推动下所发生的熙熙攘攘的东西交流情况正在融解由于“冷战”而造成的紧张气氛。这证明，发展东西方接触以加强巩固和平是一条有广阔前途的道路。人们有理由期待外长会议在这方面能够得到进一步的成就。
    应当指出：在巩固和发扬日内瓦精神的道路上，还存在不少困难。美国的一些认为只有紧张局势才有利可图的势力，早已把日内瓦精神的成就当作他们的“灾难”了。美国一些有势力的人物不断发表反对日内瓦精神的演说。美国不少报纸对日内瓦精神百般进行攻击，并且公然断言“日内瓦精神已成为过去了”。甚至有些最顽固的国际合作的敌人还公开发动“反对日内瓦精神的运动”，要求恢复“冷战”。这一切情形表明，有人力图使国际局势的发展脱离日内瓦精神的轨道，特别是为四国外长会议制造不良的气氛，以便使这次会议一事无成。
    因此，日内瓦精神对四国外长会议正在提出考验，中国人民和世界各国爱好和平人民一样，衷心地希望日内瓦四国外长会议的成功。四国外长会议的任何成就都将对进一步和缓国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平作出贡献。由于外长会议还面临着困难，一切爱好和平的人民必须从各方面努力发扬日内瓦精神，打击一切违反日内瓦精神的言论和行动，来推动会议取得积极的成就。
