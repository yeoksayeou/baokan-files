    Shanxi Province Supplies Granular Fertilizer to Wheat Producing Areas
    The Shanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently transferred the first batch of granular fertilizer made in Taiyuan City to the main wheat-producing areas of Southern and Central Shanxi to supply agricultural producers' cooperatives for use when sowing winter wheat. Another batch of granular fertilizer being manufactured in the three cities of Taiyuan, Yuci, and Yangquan will also be transported to rural areas.
    This fertilizer is made from a mixture of urban garbage, manure, ammonium sulfate, superphosphate, and potassium sulfate. It is easy to use and has good results. Now six small and medium-sized cities and towns including Linfen and Xinxian are also preparing to trial-produce granular fertilizer. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山西省供应产麦区颗粒肥料
    山西省供销合作社最近把在太原市制成的第一批颗粒肥料调往晋南、晋中主要产麦区，供应农业生产合作社播种冬小麦时施用。正在太原、榆次、阳泉三个市制造的另一批颗粒肥料也将运往农村。
    这种肥料是利用城镇的垃圾、粪便等和硫酸铵、过磷酸钙、硫酸钾混合制成的，使用方便，效果很好。现在临汾、忻县等六个中小城镇也准备试制颗粒肥料。　（新华社）
