The Urgent Demands of Peasants in Ruyi Township, Xiangtan County
Yao Li

This summer, the Ruyi Township People's Committee in Yintian District, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, was bustling with people from morning till night. Some were mutual aid team leaders bringing applications from their entire teams requesting the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. Others were individual peasants submitting reports to the township people's committee, requesting to join agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams. The Liu Junquan mutual aid team, with all twenty-three of its members being poor peasants, urgently demanded the establishment of a cooperative. Many team members, not trusting that the team leader had submitted the application to the township people's committee, followed behind him, requesting to join the cooperative. Individual peasant Pang Qimei (a poor peasant), fearing that the township people's committee would say that his family did not agree to join the cooperative, brought his entire family to the township people's committee to express their determination to join the cooperative. In one month, all twelve mutual aid teams in the township submitted thirty-one written applications to the township people's committee requesting to transform into cooperatives, and made twenty-five verbal requests. In early August, when the peasants heard that the district office was transferring key personnel to study cooperative establishment, five groups of people went to the township people's committee on the same day requesting to be transferred for study. Among the peasants applying to establish cooperatives, the poor peasants were the most eager and the most resolute in their actions. Poor peasant Liu Wensheng said, "As poor peasants, we have neither draft cattle, nor fertilizer, nor enough food. How can we farm well?" Last year, he wanted to plant double-cropping rice, but his ten-odd mu of land either had poor irrigation or poor soil quality, making it impossible to plant. He was short of food every year, and this year his family ate green wheat porridge for more than forty days. This year, after seeing the successful trial operation of six agricultural cooperatives in the township, he actively advocated for the establishment of a cooperative within the mutual aid team. When the township people's committee approved their mutual aid team's transformation into a cooperative, he immediately linked up with four peasant households to join the cooperative. He told everyone he met, "We can only achieve complete liberation and live a good life by joining the cooperative."

The upsurge of peasants in Ruyi Township taking the road of collectivization did not arise suddenly. It was formed through four years of mutual aid production, especially after the successful trial operation of agricultural cooperatives, the implementation of the Party's class policy in the countryside, and the state's assistance to agricultural cooperatives.

Last winter and this spring, six agricultural cooperatives, including Shishan and Qiushan, were established in the township. In this year's spring plowing and production, these cooperatives greatly demonstrated the superiority of collective management. At that time, the government promoted the superior Honglanjiao early rice variety in the township, calling on everyone to plant early rice. Many individual peasants and mutual aid team members were afraid to plant it. These six cooperatives immediately trial-planted 65 mu, accounting for 77 percent of the total trial-planting area in the township. The Shishan cooperative planted 17 mu. During the tense drought and the period when grain was running low, many peasants were short of food. The cooperatives all harvested early rice and provided food for their members. The Shishan cooperative harvested more than 6,500 jin of early rice from its 17 mu. After reserving enough food for all cooperative members and leaving 800 jin of rice seeds for the township, it also lent 1,300 jin of rice to two nearby mutual aid teams and twelve individual peasant households, solving their immediate food problems. Seeing the early rice harvest of the cooperatives and the peasants who received help from the Shishan cooperative, everyone deeply realized the benefits of the cooperative. For example, Su Shangde's mother firmly refused to let Su Shangde join the Shishan cooperative when it was established. Now, seeing the fresh example of the Shishan cooperative's successful trial-planting of Honglanjiao early rice, eating the early rice lent by the Shishan cooperative, and seeing that widow Liu Shuhua, who had lived a difficult life in the past, had work to do and food to eat after joining the cooperative, her thinking changed and she actively urged her son to attend the mutual aid team's meeting to strive for transformation into a cooperative. When the Shishan cooperative was considering establishing a cooperative, deputy director Su Ruisheng once mobilized mutual aid team member Su Shousheng to join the cooperative, but Su Shousheng said, "I have enough people, cattle, and farm tools. What's the point of joining the cooperative? The cooperative is just a few people and a few mu of land. I don't believe that joining the cooperative is good." During this year's spring plowing and production, he proposed to compete with the Shishan cooperative. Soon, the weather suddenly turned cold, and the rice seedlings in the paddy fields experienced serious rot. The cooperative immediately re-soaked 300 jin of seeds and applied ammonium sulfate, planting the seedlings on time. The mutual aid team where Su Shousheng was located planted the seedlings ten days later than the Shishan cooperative. Su Shousheng was still not convinced, believing that the cooperative might be good at working in the fields, but not necessarily good at working in the soil. So he proposed to compete with the Shishan cooperative in planting sweet potatoes. Unfortunately, when hoeing the sweet potato seedlings, they encountered a drought, and the people in the mutual aid team were all participating in drought resistance, so they didn't have time to hoe the seedlings. As a result, although the fields were not ruined by the drought, the weeds in the soil grew taller than the potato seedlings. The cooperative had more people and more strength, and not only resisted the drought and hoeed the land, but also harvested the early rice. At this time, Su Shousheng was convinced of the benefits of the agricultural cooperative. Now, whenever he meets a cadre, he asks to join the cooperative. He said, "I didn't want to join the cooperative last year when others asked me, but this year I must join."

There are four dams near the Shishan cooperative that can irrigate 140 mu of land. Before the establishment of the cooperative, due to the imperfect water conservancy system, people dug ditches and diverted water at will, causing artificial droughts even in rainy years like last year. After the establishment of the Shishan cooperative this year, the water conservancy system was established and improved, and the four dams were fully utilized. Although there was a relatively severe drought this year, not only was there no water shortage for the original 100-plus mu of land, but water was also diverted to irrigate more than 20 mu of land. This fact also had a great impact on the peasants of Ruyi Township.

The superiority of the cooperative attracts the vast number of peasants like a magnet. The implementation of the Party's class policy in the countryside has further stimulated the enthusiasm of poor peasants to join the cooperative. Poor peasant Su Biqing said, "The Party relies on us in the countryside. We must take the lead in doing all kinds of work well, especially the work of establishing cooperatives." Poor peasant Zhu Wanquan asked to jump to a different team and join the Qiushan cooperative last year when it was established. The Party branch, considering that the team would lack key personnel after he jumped to a different team, asked him to run the mutual aid team well and strive for transformation into a cooperative. Since then, he has led the mutual aid team very well. Since the beginning of autumn, he has held seven team member meetings to study the issue of transforming into a cooperative.

The state's multifaceted support for the cooperative, especially the granting of more than 900 yuan of poor peasant cooperative funds in the township, has greatly strengthened the confidence of poor and middle peasants in taking the road of collectivization. Poor peasant Pang Faguang eagerly wanted to join the cooperative, but was afraid to raise it because he was worried that he could not afford to pay the cooperative entry fund. Later, when he heard that the government had a poor peasant cooperative fund loan, he excitedly submitted a request to the township people's committee to join the cooperative. Poor peasant Xiao Yisheng was very active when the Gongyi cooperative was established, but later, because he did not have cash to invest, he was discriminated against by the middle peasant members and his mood was once low. Later, the state lent him a 30 yuan cooperative fund loan, and he became even more active than before. This June, some middle peasant members complained of food shortages and were unwilling to work, but he took the lead in working, driving the members to actively carry out production. Seeing that poor peasants could also pay off the cooperative entry fund, the middle peasant members dispelled their concerns about poor peasants taking advantage of them, thus strengthening their confidence in joining and running the cooperative.

In order to lead the collectivization movement well, the Ruyi Township branch of the Chinese Communist Party, with the assistance of the work team, has made a plan for the development of cooperatives throughout the township. In addition to the six cooperatives established last winter and this spring, three new cooperatives were established before this autumn. According to the current new situation in the countryside, the Party branch plans to build two more cooperatives this winter and next spring, three at one time and one at another. At the same time, the six old cooperatives will be expanded, increasing the number of members by 37 households. In this way, the number of peasant households participating in agricultural cooperatives in the township will increase to 281, accounting for more than 68 percent of the total number of households in the township. In the next two years, 84 more individual peasants will be absorbed into the cooperatives. By the spring of 1957, there will be no more individual peasants in the township except for landlords and rich peasants. He Zeqi, the secretary of the Party branch, is full of confidence in this cooperative building plan. He said excitedly, "We are getting closer and closer to the road to socialism."

    湘潭县如意乡农民的迫切要求
    耀黎
    今年夏天，在湖南湘潭县银田区如意乡人民委员会里，从早到晚是川流不息的人。有的是互助组长带来了全组要求建立农业生产合作社的申请书，有的是个体农民向乡人民委员会打报告，要求参加农业生产合作社或者是互助组。刘君泉互助组的二十三户组员全是贫农。他们迫切要求建社。许多组员看到组长拿了申请书到乡人民委员会去还不放心，也跟在后面，向乡人民委员会要求入社。个体农民庞奇美（贫农）怕乡人民委员会说他家里的人不同意入社，便带着家里的人一同到乡人民委员会来，表示全家入社的决心。一个月的时间，全乡十二个互助组，就分别向乡人民委员会写了要求转社的申请书三十一件，口头申请二十五次。八月初，农民们听说区公所要调骨干去学习建社，当天便有五班人到乡人民委员会请求调去学习。在申请建社的农民中，贫农要求最为迫切，行动也最坚决。贫农刘文生说：“我们贫农作田，一无耕牛，二无肥料，三缺口粮，这又如何作得好田。”去年他就想种双季稻；但是他的十亩多田，不是水利不好便是土质不好不能种。他年年缺口粮，今年他一家人便吃了四十多天的青麦粥。今年他看到全乡六个农业合作社试办成功后，在互助组里积极主张建社。当乡人民委员会批准他们的互助组转社时，他立即串连了四户农民一同入社，他逢人便说：“我们只有入社才得彻底翻身，才能有好日子过。”
    如意乡农民走合作化道路的热潮，并不是一下子生长起来的，而是经过四年来的互助生产，特别是经过农业合作社的试办成功和党在农村中阶级政策的贯彻执行，以及国家对农业合作社的援助所形成的。
    去冬今春，全乡成立了狮山、球山等六个农业合作社。在今年的春耕生产中，这些社就大大显示了集体经营的优越性。当时政府在这个乡推广红蓝脚早稻优良品种，号召大家种早稻。许多个体农民和互助组组员都不敢种。这六个社一下就试种了六十五亩，占全乡试种总亩数的百分之七十七。狮山社种了十七亩。在抗旱紧张、粮食青黄不接的时候，许多农民缺口粮。合作社都收了早稻，接上了口粮。狮山社十七亩早稻收了六千五百多斤。除留足了全社社员口粮和给全乡留下八百斤谷种外，还借出了一千三百斤谷子给附近的两个互助组和十二户个体农民，解决了他们当时的口粮问题。眼看合作社的早稻收成和得到狮山社帮助的农民，都深深体会到了合作社的好处。如苏尚德的母亲，在狮山社建社的时候，苏尚德要入社，她坚决不肯。现在看到狮山社试种红蓝脚早稻成功的新鲜事，吃到了狮山社借给的早稻米，又看到往年生活很困难的寡妇刘淑华入社后有了事做，有了粮食，她思想变了，主动催促儿子去参加互助组的会，争取转社。在狮山社酝酿建社的时候，副社长苏瑞生曾动员互助组苏寿生入社，苏寿生说：“我人齐，牛齐，农具齐，入社做什么？合作社也不过是几个现人，几亩现田，我偏不信入社就是好。”今年春耕生产中，他提出要同狮山社比赛。不久天气突然变冷，秧田发生了严重的烂秧现象。社里马上补浸了三百斤种谷，又补施了硫酸錏，按季节插上了秧。苏寿生所在的互助组，插秧却比狮山社迟了十天。苏寿生还不服气，认为合作社田里的功夫搞得好，不一定土里的功夫也搞得好，于是又提出同狮山社比种甘薯。不巧锄甘薯苗时正遇天旱，互助组的人都参加抗旱，顾不上锄苗。结果虽然田没旱坏，土里的杂草却长得比薯苗还高。合作社人多力量大，不但抗了旱、锄了地，还收割了早稻。这时，苏寿生对农业合作社的好处口服心服了。现在他一碰到干部便提出要求入社。他说：“去年别人要我入社我不来，今年我非入社不可。”
    狮山社附近有四座水坝，可灌溉一百四十亩田。建社以前，因水利制度不健全，人们随便挖沟引水，就是像去年那样多雨的年头，还造成了人为的干旱。今年狮山社建成后，建立和健全了水利制度，四座水坝得到了充分利用。今年虽然遭受了比较严重的干旱，不仅原来的一百多亩田不缺水，而且还匀出水来多灌溉了二十多亩田。这一事实，对如意乡农民的影响也是很大的。
    合作社的优越性像磁石一样地吸引着广大农民。党在农村中的阶级政策的贯彻执行，更激发了贫农入社的积极性。贫农苏必清说：“党在农村中依靠的是我们，各项工作，特别是建社工作我们硬要带头做好才对。”贫农朱文全去年在球山社建社的时候，就要求跳组转社，党支部考虑到他跳组后组内缺乏骨干，要他把互助组办好，争取转社。从此以后，他把互助组领导得很好，入秋以来，先后召开了七次组员会，研究转社问题。
    国家对合作社的多方扶助，特别在全乡贷放了贫农合作基金九百多元，大大增强了贫农和中农走合作化道路的信心。贫农庞法广迫切要求入社，但是顾虑缴不起入社基金，不敢提出来。后来听说政府有贫农合作基金贷款，他非常兴奋地向乡人民委员会提出了入社要求。贫农肖义生在公益社建社的时候表现很积极，后来因为没有现金投资，曾遭受中农社员的歧视，情绪一度低落。后来国家贷给了他三十元合作基金贷款，他比以前更积极了。今年六月部分中农社员叫喊缺粮，不愿出工，他却带头出工，带动社员积极搞好生产。中农社员看到了贫农也能缴清入社基金，解除了怕贫农揩油的顾虑，因而也加强了入社和办社的信心。
    为了领导好合作化运动，中共如意乡支部已在工作组的协助下作出了全乡发展合作社的规划。这乡除去冬今春建立的六个社外，今年秋前又新建了三个社。党支部根据当前农村的新情况，准备今冬明春再建两次，一次建三个，一次建一个。同时扩大六个老社，增加社员三十七户。这样全乡参加农业合作社的农户就增加到二百八十一户，占全乡总户数的百分之六十八多。在今后两年内，再把八十四户个体农民吸收进社里来，到了一九五七年春，全乡除了地主和富农外，再也没有个体农民了。党支部书记贺泽奇对这个建社计划充满了信心，他兴奋地说：“我们到社会主义的路一天一天更近了。”
