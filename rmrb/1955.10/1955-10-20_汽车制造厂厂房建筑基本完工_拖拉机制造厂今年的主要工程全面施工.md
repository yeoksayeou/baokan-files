Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 19th. The construction of all factory buildings at the First Automobile Works has entered the completion stage.

The factory buildings, power stations, and other auxiliary buildings of this large-scale automobile manufacturing plant, which began construction in the first year of China's first Five-Year Plan, are now basically completed. More than 30 railway lines, which bear the main transportation tasks of the entire plant, have been laid into the factory buildings. Large-scale power pipelines, tens of thousands of meters long, and cables running across the entire plant have also been connected to the various factory buildings. By the end of October, workers in all workshops throughout the plant will be able to work in warm and comfortable indoor environments.

Currently, a large number of construction workers have begun to transfer to new construction posts, with only a small number of civil engineering workers painting the last layer of paint on the factory buildings, or carrying out minor finishing work such as leveling the factory grounds, laying the foundation, and laying the floor. In order to complete the construction task of the First Automobile Works ahead of schedule, they have launched a vigorous completion competition in various construction areas.

The construction site, which was once filled with noise, now clearly transmits the clang of equipment installation and the sound of machines being adjusted for production. Trains constantly transport large quantities of mechanical equipment from outside the factory into the workshops. Thousands of large and sophisticated mechanical equipment installed according to fixed production lines are shining brightly under the sunlight obliquely entering through the factory skylights. The auxiliary, chassis, metal products, accessories, woodworking, non-ferrous repair casting, and heat treatment workshops, which were the first to have their equipment installed, have successively adjusted production. The number of production personnel entering the workshops instead of civil engineering workers is increasing. They spend all day in the tall and spacious workshops, reading technical data, wiping equipment, or gathering around the machinery in groups, carefully studying operating techniques, and striving to master all the production techniques for manufacturing automobiles before production begins.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 19th. The factory buildings of the auxiliary, non-ferrous repair casting, woodworking, and model workshops, which were the first to be started at the First Automobile Works, as well as three power stations, six warehouses, and eighteen railways, have been handed over. In October, the chassis, forging, and wire drawing workshop buildings, three power stations, and ten auxiliary buildings will also be ready for handover. In addition, the casting, motorcycle, and body pressing workshop buildings and a small part of the auxiliary projects will also be handed over for acceptance at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. The quality of the completed projects has been inspected and meets the design requirements.

The acceptance and handover organization of the First Automobile Works was established at the end of last year. In May of this year, the contracting unit also established a self-inspection and handover committee to lead the various construction areas to check the project quality and the sorting out of various basic data in order to prepare for the handover. Many Soviet experts, although their term of return to their country has arrived, are still working hard in order to smoothly complete the handover and acceptance of this modern large-scale project.

Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The forging workshop building of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant started construction on the 15th. Together with the previously started factory buildings of the auxiliary workshop, the non-ferrous metal repair casting workshop, and the warehouse of a general warehouse, the main projects planned to be built this year have been fully started.

The construction unit undertaking this factory has made preparations in advance, so the construction dates of each workshop are earlier than originally planned. After the start of construction, the workers also launched a labor competition, continuously improving labor organization and operating methods, and the progress of various projects is relatively rapid. After more than ten days of work, the non-ferrous metal repair casting workshop has now completed the excavation of the foundation earthwork and the pouring of the column base concrete.

According to the suggestions of Soviet experts, the construction of this factory will adopt the Soviet advanced integrated hoisting method, using a three-dimensional parallel operation method to hoist the columns, roof beams, roof trusses, purlins, and roof panels onto the factory building at one time. To implement this new method, it is necessary to prefabricate various components simultaneously in advance. For this reason, the relevant processing plants have begun to implement two-shift or three-shift production.

### 汽车制造厂厂房建筑基本完工  拖拉机制造厂今年的主要工程全面施工

    汽车制造厂厂房建筑基本完工
    拖拉机制造厂今年的主要工程全面施工
    新华社长春十九日电　第一汽车制造厂的全部厂房建筑工程，已经进入了完工阶段。
    在我国第一个五年计划头一年开始建设的这座规模宏大的汽车制造厂的厂房、动力站和其他附属建筑，现在都已基本完工。担负着全厂主要运输任务的三十多条铁路线，已铺进了厂房。长达几万公尺的大型动力管道和横穿全厂的电缆，也同各个厂房接通了。到十月底，全厂各车间工人们都可在温暖舒适的室内进行工作了。
    目前，大批建筑工作人员已开始转移到新的建设岗位上去，只有较少的土木建筑工人在厂房上涂饰着最后一层油漆，或在进行平整厂地、打地坪、铺地板等零星的结尾工作。他们为了提前完成第一汽车制造厂的建筑任务，在各个工区里都展开了热火朝天的完工竞赛。
    不久以前充满着一片喧哗声的工地上，现在清楚地传出了安装设备的铿锵声和调整生产的机器的运转声。火车整天不息地把大量机械设备从厂外运进了车间。按照固定生产线安装起来的几千台庞大精良的机械设备，被厂房天窗里斜射进来的阳光照得闪闪发光。最先安装好设备的辅助、底盘、金属品、附件、木工、有色修铸、热处理等车间，已先后调整生产。代替土木建筑工人走进车间的生产人员已愈来愈多。他们整天在高大宽敞的车间内，翻阅着技术资料，擦洗设备，或成群地围着机械，精心地研究操作技术，争取在开工生产以前，把制造汽车的全部生产技术掌握起来。
    据新华社长春十九日电　第一汽车制造厂最先动工的辅助、有色修铸、木工、模型四座工场厂房，以及三个动力站、六个仓库和十八条铁路，已经交工。十月份具备交工条件的还有底盘、锻工、拔丝三座工场厂房，三个动力站和十个附属建筑。另外铸工、摩托、车身压制等工场厂房和一小部分附属工程，也将在今年年底或明年年初先后交工验收。已经交工的工程经过检验，质量都符合设计要求。
    第一汽车制造厂交工验收机构在去年年底就已成立。今年五月，承包单位为了在交工前作好准备工作，还成立了一个自检交工委员会，领导各工区检查工程质量和各项基本资料的整理工作。很多苏联专家虽已到了回国的期限，但为了顺利完成这个现代化大工程的交工验收工作，仍在辛劳地工作着。
    新华社十七日讯　第一拖拉机制造厂锻工场厂房已在十五日动工。连同以前动工的辅助工场、有色金属修理铸件工场的厂房和一个总仓库的库房，计划在今年兴建的主要工程已全面施工。
    承建这个工厂的施工单位由于事先抓紧时间做好了准备工作，使各工场施工日期都比原计划提前了。开工以后，工人们又开展了劳动竞赛，不断地改进劳动组织和操作方法，各项工程的进展都比较迅速。有色金属修理铸件工场经过十多天的劳动，现在已经完成了挖掘基础土方和浇注柱基混凝土的工程。
    根据苏联专家的建议，这个厂的施工将采用苏联先进的综合吊装法，以立体平行作业的方法一次就把厂房上的立柱、屋梁、屋架、檩条和屋面板吊装好。要实行这个新方法，就需要把各种构件同时提前预制出来，为此，有关的加工厂已经开始实行两班或三班制生产。
