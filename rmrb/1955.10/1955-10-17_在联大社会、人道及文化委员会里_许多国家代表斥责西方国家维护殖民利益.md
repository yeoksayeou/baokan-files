Xinhua News Agency, 16th, New York: A fierce anti-colonial debate has recently unfolded in the United Nations General Assembly's Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee.

    When the committee began discussing the review process for the articles of the draft international human rights covenants, Denmark, supported by the United States and Britain, proposed a motion to temporarily suspend discussion of the articles in the draft covenants concerning the recognition of the right to national self-determination. UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, violating the traditional concept of the responsibilities and position of the Secretary-General, also issued a special statement supporting this motion.

    In the three days of debate from October 11th to 13th, the Danish motion and Hammarskjöld's statement were fiercely attacked by representatives of many Asian, Arab, and Latin American countries.

    Saudi Arabian representative Baroody spoke several times, condemning the attempts of colonial countries and the Secretary-General's statement defending the interests of colonial countries. He said, "Every year we find the colonial countries raising the same objections to this principle (of national self-determination)." He said that the United Nations must take a stand on the issue of colonialism, because dependent areas "are still bleeding."

    Indian representative Menon said that the Secretary-General was opposing the majority opinion in the United Nations. He said that the Bandung Conference had already expressed its position on the issue of colonialism.

    Syrian representative Yughi Hakim said: "Bloody struggles are taking place in North Africa for freedom, and people are shedding a lot of blood there. This is because the right to self-determination has not been recognized by those colonial countries that are trying to hinder the progress of history." He said that Hammarskjöld wanted to avoid expressing different opinions in the United Nations, "but this division of opinion already exists." The essence of this division is: "There are those who want to be masters and those who are trying to break their shackles."

    Salvadoran representative Camacho said that it was clear that someone was trying to hinder the discussion of national self-determination, thereby allowing situations that we cannot tolerate to persist for a long time. He said that dependent territories and non-self-governing territories must not be allowed to continue to exist.

    In his speech, the Soviet representative supported the opinions of the Asian and African countries and opposed postponing the discussion of the issue of the right to national self-determination.

    The committee finally rejected the colonial countries' attempt to postpone the discussion of the part of the draft human rights covenants related to the recognition of the right to national self-determination by a vote of thirty-six to eighteen.

    The United Press said that this debate reflects "the anti-colonial movement carried out by Asian and African countries in the United Nations with the support of Latin American countries."

### 在联大社会、人道及文化委员会里  许多国家代表斥责西方国家维护殖民利益

    在联大社会、人道及文化委员会里
    许多国家代表斥责西方国家维护殖民利益
    新华社十六日讯　纽约消息：在联合国大会社会、人道及文化委员会里，最近展开了一场反殖民主义的激烈辩论。
    在委员会开始讨论国际人权公约草案各条款审议程序问题时，丹麦在美英两国支持下提出动议，要求暂不讨论公约草案中关于承认民族自决权的条款。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德违反有关秘书长的职责和地位的传统概念，也出来发表一篇特别声明，支持这项动议。
    在十月十一日到十三日三天的辩论里，丹麦动议和哈马舍尔德声明遭到许多亚洲、阿拉伯和拉丁美洲国家的代表的猛烈抨击。
    沙特阿拉伯代表巴鲁迪几次发言，斥责殖民国家的企图和秘书长维护殖民国家利益的声明。他说，“每一年我们都发现殖民国家对（民族自决）这个原则提出同样的反对”。他说，联合国必须在殖民主义问题上表明态度，因为附属地区“还在流血”。
    印度代表梅农说，秘书长是反对联合国中的多数意见。他说，万隆会议已经对殖民主义问题表明了态度。
    叙利亚代表尤盖·哈金说：“为了争取自由，流血斗争正在北非进行，人民在那里大量流血。这就是因为自决权没有得到那些企图阻挠历史前进的殖民国家的承认。”他说，哈马舍尔德想避免在联合国里表示不同的意见，“可是这种意见分歧已经存在”。这种分歧的本质就在于：“有当主子的人和尽力想打破自己的枷锁的人”。
    萨尔瓦多代表卡马乔说，显然有人在企图阻挠讨论民族自决问题，从而使我们不能容许的情况长期保存下去。他说，决不能容许附属地和非自治领土继续保存下去。
    苏联代表在发言中支持亚非国家的意见，反对推迟讨论民族自决权问题。
    委员会最后以三十六票对十八票否决了殖民国家企图推迟讨论人权公约草案中有关承认民族自决权部分的。
    合众社说，这次辩论反映出“亚非国家在拉丁美洲国家支持下在联合国内进行的反殖民主义的运动”。
