    Agricultural Cooperatives Must Not Engage in Exploitation of Labor
    To the Editor: When Wangxian District, Liling County, Hunan Province harvested early rice at the end of July this year, some members of agricultural production cooperatives, seeing this year's bumper harvest and the low wages for local laborers, hired people to work in their place during the harvest. For example, when the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Shiwang Township was harvesting early rice, the members were idle at home, doing nothing, but hired thirteen people from outside to cut the rice. Similarly, Li Zengnan, a member of the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Huangsha Township, went out to do other work but hired two workers to come to the cooperative to thresh rice for him, which was counted as his own labor work points.
    Semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives are banners leading the broad masses of peasants onto the socialist path. The practice of certain cooperatives in Wangxian District of hiring peasants from outside the cooperative to work for them at low wages is actually a form of exploitation and violates the purpose of establishing the cooperatives. This erroneous practice should be corrected. If certain agricultural production cooperatives do indeed feel that there is a shortage of labor, they should improve and enhance the contract labor system, do a good job of evaluating work and calculating points to stimulate the labor enthusiasm of the members and tap the labor potential within the cooperative. They can also adopt the method of exchanging labor and mutual assistance to coordinate the use of labor with mutual aid teams and individual peasants. If these methods still cannot solve the difficulty of labor shortage, it is permissible to temporarily hire a few short-term workers to ensure production; however, they must be given reasonable compensation, and no exploitation is allowed. Moreover, they should be united and helped with a socialist spirit to establish the prestige of agricultural production cooperatives among the masses and attract peasants from outside the cooperative to take the path of collectivization.

    农业社不能进行雇工剥削
    编辑同志：今年七月底湖南省醴陵县王仙区收割早稻的时候，某些农业生产合作社的社员看到今年丰收了，而当地雇工工资又很低，就在收割中请人来代替自己干活。例如，石湾乡第一农业生产合作社在收割早稻的时候，社员们都在家里闲着，不做事，却到外面请了十三个人割禾。又如，黄沙乡第一农业生产合作社社员李增南自己出外做别的工作，却请了两个工到社里来替他扮禾，算自己的劳动工分。
    半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社是带领广大农民走社会主义道路的旗帜。王仙区某些社采取的用较低的工资雇请社外农民为自己作工的做法，实际上就是一种剥削的行为，违背了办社的目的。这种错误作法应该得到纠正。如果某些农业生产合作社确实感到劳动力不足，就应该改进和提高包工制度，作好评工计分工作，以激发社员的劳动积极性，发掘社内劳动潜力；还可以采取换工互助的办法，同互助组、个体农民调济使用劳动力。如果这些办法还不能解决劳动力缺乏的困难，为了搞好生产，而临时雇请几个短工也是可以的；但是必须给以合理报酬，不许从中进行剥削，而且要以社会主义精神去团结帮助他们，树立农业生产合作社在群众中的威信，吸引社外农民走合作化的道路。
