Correct Understanding, Do a Good Job of Preparations for Building Cooperatives
Yan Jingzhan, Deputy Secretary of the Jiangning County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiangsu Province

After Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, conveyed the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on the issue of agricultural cooperation, some comrades developed a sense of impatience due to insufficient understanding of the spirit of the instructions. They believed that since the masses urgently demanded to establish cooperatives, preparations were unnecessary before establishing cooperatives. It was also unnecessary to explain the principles, policies, and methods of establishing cooperatives to the masses; and in the process of establishing cooperatives, it was unnecessary to deeply mobilize the masses. As long as a few trained key members went back for individual networking, many agricultural production cooperatives could be established. We believe that this idea is harmful. The instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao teach us to "not fight unprepared battles" and "not fight battles without certainty of victory." We must examine the right-leaning conservative thinking in leading the agricultural cooperation movement, and at the same time, prevent the occurrence of impetuous and rash advances. In the face of the new situation in the agricultural cooperation movement, we should be conscientious, overcome difficulties, and fully prepare for building cooperatives. Only in this way can we lead the movement to develop healthily.

In order to correctly implement the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we conducted preparations for building cooperatives in all aspects while examining right-leaning conservative thinking.

In late August, the county party committee, on the basis of earnestly studying documents and improving socialist consciousness, checked the right-leaning conservative thinking manifested in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in light of the specific conditions of the county, as well as the work losses caused by this thinking. In February 1953, the county party committee experimentally established an agricultural production cooperative in Huangnitang Village, Dongshan Town. Due to relaxing political and ideological work, some members, led by middle peasants, demanded to withdraw from the cooperative. At that time, the county party committee did not carefully analyze the situation in the cooperative and concluded that the conditions of the cooperative were too poor, and planned to mobilize for reorganization. It was only under the instructions of the higher authorities that it was barely maintained. It can be seen from this that we lacked confidence and courage in leading the agricultural cooperation movement, and we wavered when faced with the wavering and resistance of some middle peasants. Last July, the provincial party committee asked us to experimentally establish three cooperative zones, but we reluctantly agreed to experiment with two, and even that task was not completed. We established eighty-six cooperatives in Zone 1, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for only 25.5 percent of the total number of farm households; and we established one hundred and thirteen cooperatives in Zone 7, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for only 34.9 percent of the total number of farm households. Even so, many comrades still shouted that Zones 1 and 7 were "advancing rashly" this year. Is it really "advancing rashly"? Taking Zone 7, which has the largest number of cooperatives, as an example, as of August this year, there were still 40 cooperatives spontaneously established by farmers that had not been approved. It can be seen that we have not satisfied the farmers' demand for establishing cooperatives, and it is not "advancing rashly" but conservatism.

In the process of studying the documents, the members of the county party committee also conducted self-examinations. Some comrades were afraid of being labeled as "rashly advancing" and were constrained in their work; some comrades believed that "it is easy to establish cooperatives but difficult to consolidate them" and were afraid of doing arduous work, so they were unwilling to establish more cooperatives; some comrades saw that the production order of some cooperatives had not been established and that there were some chaotic phenomena in production, so they said that "cooperatives are not as good as mutual aid teams, and mutual aid teams are not as good as individual households," and therefore were not enthusiastic about establishing cooperatives. During the examination, everyone realized that these incorrect ideas were the reason why the leadership work could not meet the needs of the masses to establish cooperatives.

While examining thinking, the county party committee summarized the experience of establishing cooperatives in the past few years. The county party committee believes that although there was right-leaning conservative thinking in the leadership of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the past, the work was still successful under the leadership and supervision of the provincial and prefectural party committees. The cooperatives we established in the previous two years were all consolidated. After the general line propaganda was carried out in 1953, not only was the Huangnitang Agricultural Production Cooperative consolidated and expanded, but also fifty-seven new cooperatives were experimentally established. These cooperatives were all consolidated in 1954. In that year, Jiangning County suffered a serious flood, and some affected cooperatives relied on collective strength to carry out production for self-rescue, setting a good example for the masses; some cooperatives that were not affected by the disaster generally increased production, and the yield greatly exceeded that of local mutual aid teams and individual farmers. Therefore, from last autumn to this spring, the number of agricultural cooperatives in the county quickly developed to 570, plus the 100 spontaneous cooperatives approved in this year's autumn harvest distribution, there are now 670 cooperatives in the county, more than ten times the original number, and the vast majority of cooperatives have increased production.

In order to prepare for the development of agricultural production cooperatives, and at the same time to overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking existing in the leadership work and the just emerging impetuous mood, we have further carried out socialist ideological education work for the peasants since the beginning of August this year; we have systematically summarized the production achievements of various cooperatives and widely publicized them to peasants outside the cooperatives. And we organized mutual aid teams and individual farmers to compare with agricultural cooperatives, to see what things mutual aid teams were not as good as agricultural cooperatives. On the basis of the improvement of farmers' awareness, we explained the specific policies of agricultural cooperatives to them so that they could consciously decide whether or not to join the cooperatives and when to join the cooperatives. Whenever this was done, the farmers' enthusiasm for joining the cooperatives was very high. Five mutual aid teams with thirty-two households in Xiaoli Village, Dongshan Town, had thirty-one households asking to establish cooperatives. Ten mutual aid teams in Luo Village all asked to establish cooperatives. In the future, we plan to conduct another in-depth and systematic publicity campaign during the comprehensive planning work of cooperation and the income distribution work of the old cooperatives, so as to lay a solid ideological foundation for the great development of the cooperation movement.

On the basis of ideological mobilization, the county party committee immediately conducted a comprehensive plan for the agricultural cooperation movement in the county. This plan has undergone several discussions and revisions. This plan is: from this autumn to next spring, the number of agricultural cooperatives in the county will be developed to 2,413, with 63,362 peasant households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 51.19 percent of the total number of farm households in the county (the original number of households joining the cooperatives accounted for only 14.38 percent of the total number of farm households); from the autumn of 1956 to the spring of 1957, the number of agricultural cooperatives in the county will be developed to 3,122, with 83,004 peasant households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 65 percent of the total number of farm households; from the autumn of 1957 to the spring of 1958, the number of agricultural cooperatives will be developed to 4,188, with 108,836 peasant households joining the cooperatives, accounting for 85.23 percent of the total number of farm households, reaching the goal of county-wide cooperation. In addition to the county party committee's unified plan for the whole county, the districts and townships must also carry out comprehensive planning. At present, the county party committee has completed the pilot work of comprehensive planning for two townships, and the districts are also carrying out pilot work. According to the experience of the county party committee's typical experiments, when carrying out planning in the township, the party branch must first conduct a thorough investigation of all farm households in the township and rank them into three teams: first, a class foundation ranking, to distinguish who is the force to rely on and who is the object of unity, so that the establishment of cooperatives will not be blind and it will be easy to implement the class policy; second, a mutual aid team ranking, to distinguish which teams have enough conditions and which teams need to create conditions, so that each team has a clear idea and actively creates conditions for joining the cooperatives; third, a farm household ranking for joining the cooperatives, to distinguish who joins the cooperatives first and who joins the cooperatives later, so as to establish cooperatives in batches in a planned and prepared manner. After conducting sufficient investigation and research and determining the comprehensive plan, the masses can be mobilized under leadership to ensure the healthy development of the cooperation movement.

At the same time, the county party committee conducted an understanding and training of rural workers and key members of the cooperatives throughout the county. According to the county party committee's understanding, among the 90 district committee members in the county, 55 fully understand the principles and policies of establishing cooperatives, 24 have a smattering of knowledge, and 11 do not understand. Among the 449 township branch committee members in the nine districts, 252 fully understand, 106 have a smattering of knowledge, and 91 do not understand. It can be seen from this that before establishing cooperatives and in the process of establishing cooperatives, training and cultivating cooperative workers is a very urgent task. From June this year to the present, in addition to having trained 1,918 key members of the old cooperatives and more than 4,700 key members of the new cooperatives through short-term training, the 133 staff members of the work team drawn from the county and district party committees have also been trained and sent to various districts. The members of the county party committee will also go deep into the townships to personally grasp the work of establishing cooperatives and learn from the experience of establishing cooperatives.

Experience has proved that in the preparation work for establishing cooperatives, promoting the mutual union of many mutual aid teams to form joint mutual aid teams and laying a good foundation for establishing cooperatives is an effective way to guide the masses to cooperation. Eight and nine districts established sixty-two joint groups this spring, of which twenty have already formally established cooperatives. In the future, we must plan to develop this kind of joint group.

In order to learn from past lessons and strengthen the leadership of new and old cooperatives and mutual aid teams, so that the development work and consolidation work of agricultural cooperatives are closely combined, under the guidance of the spirit of the secretary taking the lead and the whole party running cooperatives, the county party committee has also decided that the county party committee and the district party committees should carry out division of labor, with special personnel in charge of the following four tasks: guiding the work of establishing cooperatives; preliminary sorting out and consolidating after the new cooperatives are established; consolidating the old cooperatives; guiding the work of mutual aid teams. Doing a good job in establishing cooperatives and consolidating work can ensure the normal and healthy development of the movement.

    端正认识，做好建社准备工作
    中共江苏省江宁县委副书记　颜景詹
    江苏省江宁县传达了党中央和毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示以后，有一部分同志，由于对指示精神领会不够，产生了一种急躁情绪。他们认为既然群众迫切要求办社，那么，在建社以前，就可以不作准备工作，就可以不向群众说明办社的方针、政策和办法，在建社过程中，也可以不必去深入发动群众，只要几个经过训练的骨干回去个别串连就可以办起许多农业生产合作社。我们认为这种思想是一种有害的思想。中央和毛主席的指示教导我们，“不打无准备的仗”，“不打无把握的仗”，我们要检查领导合作化运动的右倾保守思想，同时也要防止发生急躁冒进情绪。在农业合作化运动的新形势面前，我们应当兢兢业业，克服困难，充分做好建社准备工作。只有这样，我们才能领导运动健康地向前发展。
    为了正确地贯彻执行中央和毛主席的指示，我们在检查右倾保守思想的过程中，同时从各方面进行了建社准备工作。
    八月下旬，县委在认真学习文件，提高了社会主义觉悟的基础上，针对本县具体情况，检查了在互助合作运动中表现出来的右倾保守思想，以及由这种思想造成的工作上的损失。一九五三年二月，县委在东山镇黄泥塘村试办了一个农业生产合作社，由于放松了政治思想工作，这个社曾发生了以中农为首的一部分社员要求退社的问题。当时县委没有仔细分析社内各方面的情况，就断定这个社条件太差，打算动员改组，后经上级指示，才勉强坚持办下来。从这件事情可以看出，我们领导合作化运动，缺乏信心和勇气，一碰到某些中农的动摇和抵触，就发生了动摇。去年七月，省委要求我们试办三个合作化区，我们勉强答应试办二个，但也没有完成任务。我们在一区办了八十六个社，入社户数只占总农户的百分之二十五点五；七区办了一百十三个社，入社户数只占总农户的百分之三十四点九。即使如此，今年仍有许多同志喊一、七区“冒进”了。是不是“冒进”了呢？就拿办社最多的七区来说，到今年八月，还有农民自发办起来的四十个社没有批准。可见我们并没有满足农民办社的要求，不是“冒进”而是保守。
    在学习文件当中，县委委员又各自进行了检查。有的同志因为怕戴“冒进”的帽子，在工作当中束手束脚；有的同志认为“建社容易巩固难”，怕做艰苦工作，因而不愿意多建社；有的同志看到某些社生产秩序没有建立起来，生产上有些混乱现象，就说“合作社不如互助组，互助组不如单干户”，因而对建社不热心。检查当中，大家都认识了这些不正确的思想，就是领导工作不能满足群众办社要求的原因。
    在检查思想的同时，县委对过去几年办社工作的经验进行了总结。县委认为过去在互助合作运动的领导工作中虽然存在右倾保守思想，但是在省委和地委的领导督促下，工作仍然是有成绩的。我们前二年所办的社都是巩固的。一九五三年进行总路线宣传之后，不仅黄泥塘农业生产合作社得到了巩固和扩大，而且还试办了五十七个新社。这些社在一九五四年都巩固下来了。这一年江宁县发生了严重的水灾，一部分受灾的社依靠集体力量，进行生产自救，给群众树立了良好的榜样；一部分没有受灾的社普遍增了产，产量大大超过当地互助组和个体农民。因此，从去秋到今春，全县农业合作社很快就发展到了五百七十个，加上今年秋收分配中批准了的一百个自发社，现在全县已有六百七十个社，比原来的增加了十倍多，而绝大部分社都增了产。
    为了做好发展农业生产合作社的准备工作，同时克服在领导工作中存在的右倾保守思想和刚刚露头的急躁情绪，我们从今年八月上旬开始，进一步地对农民进行了社会主义思想教育工作；有计划地总结了各个社的生产成绩，向社外农民作了广泛宣传。并组织了互助组和个体农民同农业合作社对比，看互助组哪些事情不如农业合作社。在农民觉悟提高的基础上，即向他们说清农业合作社的具体政策，使他们能够自觉地决定自己入不入社，何时入社。凡是这样做了的，农民要求入社的情绪就很高。东山镇小李村五个互助组三十二户，有三十一户要求办社。骆村十个互助组，全部要求办社。今后，我们准备在进行合作化的全面规划工作和老社的收益分配工作中，再深入地系统地进行一次宣传工作，为合作化运动的大发展在思想方面打下巩固的基础。
    在进行思想发动的基础上，县委立即进行了本县农业合作化运动的全面规划。这个规划，经过了几次的讨论和修改。这个规划是：从今年秋天到明年春天，全县农业合作社发展到二千四百一十三个，入社农户六万三千三百六十二户，占全县农户总数的百分之五十一点一九（原来的入社农户只占全县农户总数的百分之十四点三八）；一九五六年秋到一九五七年春，全县农业合作社发展到三千一百二十二个，入社农户八万三千零四户，占农户总数的百分之六十五；一九五七年秋到一九五八年春，农业合作社发展到四千一百八十八个，入社农户十万八千八百三十六户，占全县农户总数的百分之八十五点二三，达到全县合作化。除县委对全县有了统一规划外，区、乡也必须进行全面规划。目前，县委已结束了二个乡全面规划的试点工作，各区也正在进行试点工作。根据县委典型试验的经验，在乡进行规划时，党支部首先要对全乡农户进行摸底，排三个队：一是阶级基础排队，分清谁是依靠力量，谁是团结对象，这样使办社不会盲目，便于贯彻执行阶级政策；二是互助组排队，分清哪些组已够条件，哪些组还要创造条件，使各组心中有数，主动创造入社条件；三是入社农户排队，分清谁先入社，谁后入社，作到有计划有准备地分批建社。进行了充分的调查研究，确定了全面规划以后，就可以有领导地发动群众，保证合作化运动的健康发展。
    同时，县委对全县农村工作人员和办社骨干进行了了解和训练。根据县委了解，在全县九十名区委委员中，完全懂得办社方针政策的五十五名，一知半解的二十四名，不懂的十一名。九个区四百四十九名乡支部委员中，全懂的二百五十二名，半懂的一百零六名，不懂的九十一名。由此可见，在办社之前和建社过程中，训练和培养办社工作人员是非常迫切的任务。从今年六月起到目前止，我县除已通过短期训练的方式，训练了老社骨干一千九百十八人、新社骨干四千七百多人以外，对从县委、区委抽调出来的工作队的一百三十三个工作人员，也已进行了训练，派往各区。县委各委员也将深入到乡，亲自掌握办社工作，吸取办社经验。
    经验证明，在建社准备工作中，促使许多互助组互相联合起来，组成互助联合组，打好建社基础，这是一个引导群众走向合作化的有效办法。八、九两个区今年春天已建立了六十二个联组，其中正式建社的已有二十个联组。今后还要有计划地发展这种联组。
    为了接受过去教训，加强对新老社和互助组的领导，使农业合作社的发展工作和巩固工作密切结合，在书记动手，全党办社的精神指导下，县委还决定县委和各区委都要进行分工，专人掌握以下四项工作：建社工作的指导；新社建成后的初步整理和巩固；老社的巩固；互助组工作的指导。这样做好了建社工作和整顿工作，就能保证运动正常地、健康地发展。
