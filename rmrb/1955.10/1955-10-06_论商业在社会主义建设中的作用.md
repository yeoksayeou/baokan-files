    The world socialist economic system is developing and consolidating day by day. Millions of people in the People's Democratic countries of Europe and Asia are working selflessly to create a socialist economic foundation.

    In socialist construction, different countries have many characteristics arising from different historical conditions, but the basic laws of socialist construction are the same everywhere.

    During the period of socialist construction, several components exist economically in all countries. The main ones are the nascent and continuously developing socialist component supported by the working class, and small-scale commodity production supported by the laboring peasants. The fate of socialist construction depends on the relationship between these two classes. Agriculture provides the workers with grain and the light and food industries with raw materials; conversely, agriculture is a domestic sales market for many industrial products. Therefore, the issue of the relationship between industry and agriculture, the issue of the relationship between the proletariat and the peasantry, is the most important issue in building socialism. The production basis upon which the working class relies in the conditions of the transition period is the socialist component (the form of public ownership of the means of production). And the workers' ally—the laboring peasant—is an individual small private owner. Given these different types of ownership, the only possible form of economic connection between town and country is commerce.

    V.I. Lenin directly linked the necessity of utilizing commerce in socialist construction with the problem of the existence of a small-peasant economy in the transition period and with the regulation of the economic alliance between town and country through commerce.

    The experience of the Soviet Union and now the People's Democratic countries in their struggle to build a new social system shows that a new type of commerce emerging on the basis of public ownership—socialist commerce—is fundamentally different from capitalist commerce in nature and function.

    However, because the economy of the transition period is multi-component, commerce also has a dual nature. It can be used for the interests of socialism or for the interests of capitalism.

    The socialist state must fight to control the market and cannot allow complete freedom for private commerce, because under the conditions of multiple economic components, such commercial freedom itself contains the threat of capitalist restoration. If small-peasant economy (private economy) dominates in the economic aspect, then this danger is even greater.

    But, under the conditions of multiple economic components, with millions of individual farmers and capitalist components, can the state control the market?

    To control the market, the state must become the possessor of a large number of commodities, or, in any case, become the regulator of these commodities.

    Lenin said: "The workers' state can only gain a firm footing in the economic sphere when it becomes the actual holder of sufficient grain reserves."

    In the industrial sector, the state holds all the commodities produced by socialist enterprises. At the same time, the state owns the banks used to issue credit, owns the railways and other nationalized means of transportation, and can therefore sign contracts with private capitalist enterprises for the supply and sale of these goods at stipulated prices. With the implementation of a correct procurement price policy, the issuance of deposits, and the provision of various other assistance (fertilizers, production tools, etc.), the state can become the main purchaser and holder of raw materials (cotton, wool, sugar beets, and other agricultural products) needed by the light and food industries. With raw materials in its hands, the state can more effectively influence the development of capitalist industry and commerce, directing it in the direction needed by socialist construction.

    Lenin taught that, under the conditions of the transition period, the organized procurement of agricultural products is not a simple buying and selling, but a form of economic connection between socialist industry and the small-peasant economy.

    The Soviet state did not permit free private trade, waged a struggle for the socialization of commerce and the control of the market, and concentrated large quantities of goods in its own hands. In the first year of the New Economic Policy, nearly three-quarters of the retail commodity turnover was in the hands of private merchants, while the organized market of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce held only one-quarter of the commodities sold to consumers in total. A few years later, in 1926-1927, the state and cooperatives had already controlled nearly seventy percent (67.4) of the total retail commodity turnover, while the private merchant market portion decreased correspondingly to only one-third.

    Having a dominant position in commerce and doing a good job in regulating commodity turnover (including the commodity turnover of private merchants) is very important for controlling the market. Let small shopkeepers and the smallest shopkeepers do business for a period of time. Stalin wrote: "In order to consolidate ourselves in trade, it is not at all necessary to squeeze the last small shopkeeper out of the last village, but only to turn the county into a base for Soviet trade, so that all the small shopkeepers have to revolve around the county's cooperatives and Soviet shops, like planets revolve around the sun."

    In order to better control the market, the Soviet Union had a certain division of labor between state-owned and cooperative commercial organizations. State-owned enterprises mainly consolidated their leading position in large wholesale commerce, connecting industry and cooperatives, organizing the sales of industrial products and supplying enterprises with raw materials. Lenin pointed out that the state should become a shrewd wholesale merchant, learn to do business, and make industry satisfy the needs of the peasants.

    In 1926-1927, the sales of products managed by the state-owned wholesale joint organizations were as follows: 100 percent in oil and salt, 94.5 percent in textiles, 87.5 percent in leather, 82.5 percent in oil extraction, 91 percent in glass, 98 percent in porcelain and enamel, 93.1 percent in matches, and 77.5 percent in metals.

    In retail commerce, consumer cooperatives played a major and increasing role. This is because the state invested most of its capital in the construction and development of industry, especially heavy industry. Of course, this does not mean that the state completely abandoned participation in retail commerce. The network and turnover of state-owned commercial organizations also developed in retail, but they were not the main force in this area. The state helped the cooperatives through credit, preferential freight rates, priority distribution of industrial products needed to supply residents, and other commodities.

    In 1931, cooperatives in the Soviet Union had already controlled more than 70 percent of the nation's retail commodity turnover, with the remainder being sold by state-owned commercial organizations.

    The conditions for building socialism in the Soviet Union were very difficult (economic destruction, without any external economic assistance). It took almost fifteen years for the state and cooperatives to completely control the market. In the People's Democratic countries, this process is much faster.
            ×××
    Because there is commodity production in the transition period, the law of value still exists and functions. When products are produced for sale, the labor paid for producing the product must have the form of value and be expressed through the price of the commodity. Utilizing commerce in socialist construction cannot be done without regulating prices, because freely manipulating prices in the market, just like complete freedom for private commerce, is completely contrary to the principles of planning; they can only promote the growth of capitalism, not the growth of socialism.

    Because the society's economy is multi-component in the period of transition to socialism, the development of the entire economy cannot be directly subordinate to the state plan. The state uses commercial and price agencies to influence the development of small-scale commodity and capitalist components.

    A correct price policy is of great significance for regulating the production of private components. For example, if the procurement price of wool is not high enough, and the retail price of woven wool fabrics is relatively high, then the wool will stagnate in the countryside and be processed into fabrics by crude methods. If the price ratio between rice and other grain crops is more favorable than the price of cotton, then the planting area of cotton will inevitably decrease. If the prices of agricultural products are all much lower than the prices of industrial products, this will damage the purchasing power of farmers and cause industry to lose its domestic market. If the retail prices of private merchants are lower than those of cooperatives, then, no matter how good the signs on the cooperative shops are, customers will still go to the private merchants to buy goods. Therefore, the development of cooperativized commerce, its competition with private merchants, and its role in socialist construction can only be successfully realized when appropriate price standards and price systems are established.

    Properly organizing commerce is an important economic means of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The worker-peasant alliance is not only a political and moral alliance, but also an economic alliance built on the basis of mutual benefit between the two classes.

    In the first few years of the New Economic Policy in Soviet Russia, as J.V. Stalin wrote at the time, there was a task: to win back the peasants anew on the basis of the market and prices. Previously, the peasants fought under the leadership of the working class to obtain land, and then, during the Civil War, they fought to defend these lands against domestic and foreign capitalists and landlords, but after the war, the price problem became the main problem—the prices of grain and raw materials on the one hand, and the prices of industrial products on the other.

    When the Soviet state formulated prices in planning, it certainly considered all the changes that had taken place in the revolutionary years. For example, in 1925, due to the reduction of taxes and the elimination of land rents paid to landlords, farmers saved nearly two billion rubles compared to before the revolution. Therefore, even if agriculture and industry returned to pre-war levels, the farmers' need to purchase industrial products would be much higher than before the revolution.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union waged a sharp and intense struggle against the Trotskyites, Bukharinites, and other capitalist restorationists who attempted to undermine the correct price policy. The Trotskyites proposed to raise the prices of industrial products without limit, which would inevitably bankrupt the peasants, destroy the connection between town and country, and even lead to the failure of socialist construction. The Bukharinites advocated complete freedom in the market for the benefit of capitalist elements, manipulating prices; they completely refused to use prices to absorb large amounts of peasant income as a means of promoting national industrialization.

    The Fifteenth Congress of the Communist Party, in its instructions on formulating the first Five-Year Plan, put forward instructions of great theoretical and practical significance on prices. The instructions stated that it should not be required to use agricultural funds as much as possible for industrial construction, because such use would not only destroy the raw material base of industry and the grain base of cities and the army, but also shrink the domestic market and destroy the worker-peasant connection. The Fifteenth Congress also pointed out that it would also be incorrect to completely refuse to absorb the large amount of increasing funds from the countryside to build industry, because such a refusal would delay the speed of industrialization, disrupt the balance of the market, and be detrimental to our industrialization.

    The Soviet state waged a huge struggle in prices with private capitalist elements. These private capitalist elements tried to obtain high profits by speculating and raising prices of goods in short supply, harming the interests of the working people to enrich themselves. Based on economic laws, the state stipulated fixed wholesale prices for industrial products, and stipulated unified retail prices for the most important commodities such as sugar, kerosene, and salt for various forms of trade. The state stipulated the maximum commercial markup for wholesale prices, and forced private merchants to sell goods at prices not exceeding the maximum limit by means of contracts between state-owned wholesale organizations and private merchants, and by issuing credit to them.

    The interests of various classes in the country are reflected in commerce, and conflicts occur in commerce. All the most important economic and political issues of socialist construction are intertwined in price policy.

    During the period of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, the price problem was particularly complex and acute, because it was necessary to quickly solve the tasks of national industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and strengthening national defense without any external assistance. At present, in the countries building socialism, due to the existence of the world democratic market, the mutual assistance and cooperation of many countries in economic development, and the existing and increasingly developing new socialist international division of labor, many problems are relatively easy to solve.
            ×××
    In the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, commerce is the arena for the sharpest struggle between the new and advanced and the old and reactionary. In order for socialism to win, commerce, as an old form, should be filled with new content and serve the people. Countries in the transition period have objective conditions for this. But turning the possibility of using commerce for the victory of socialism into making commerce actually serve the people depends on the correct policy of the state, the entire economic organizational activities of the state, and the selfless labor of all the working people who are consciously building socialism.

    论商业在社会主义建设中的作用
    苏联玛·马卡洛娃
    世界社会主义经济体系在日益发展和巩固。欧亚两洲人民民主国家中千百万人民正在忘我地劳动，创造着社会主义的经济基础。
    各不同国家在社会主义建设中，都有其因历史条件不同而产生的许多特点，但是社会主义建设的基本规律性，到处都是一样的。
    在社会主义建设时期，各国在经济上都存在有几种成分。其中主要的是，为工人阶级所支持的新生的、不断发展着的社会主义的成分和为劳动农民所支持的小商品生产。社会主义建设的命运，就取决于这两个阶级之间的相互关系。农业给工人以粮食，给轻工业和食品工业以原料，反过来，农业又是许多工业品的国内销售市场。因此，工业和农业的相互关系问题，无产阶级和农民的相互关系问题，是建成社会主义的最重要问题。工人阶级在过渡时期条件下所依靠的生产基础是社会主义成分（对生产资料的全民所有制形式）。而工人的同盟者——劳动农民是个体的小私有者。在所有制具有这些不同类型的情况下，城乡之间唯一可能的经济联系形式就是商业。
    弗·伊·列宁把在社会主义建设中利用商业的必要性同过渡时期在经济上存在有小农经济的问题、同通过商业来调节城乡经济联合的问题直接联系起来。
    苏联和现在人民民主国家为建成新的社会制度而斗争的经验说明，在公有制基础上出现的新型的商业——社会主义商业，在性质上和职能上都和资本主义商业根本不同。
    但是，由于过渡时期的经济是多种成分的，商业也有着两重性。它既可以为社会主义的利益而被利用，也可以为资本主义的利益而被利用。
    社会主义国家必须为掌握市场而斗争，不能容许私营商业有完全自由，因为在多种经济成分的条件下，这种商业自由本身就包含有资本主义复辟的威胁。如果在经济方面占优势的是小农经济（私有经济），那末，这种危险性就更大。
    但是，在多种经济成分的条件下，在有着千百万个体农户和资本主义成分的情况下，国家能不能掌握住市场呢？
    为了掌握市场，国家必须成为大批商品的拥有者，或者，无论如何也要成为这些商品的调节者。
    列宁说过：“工人的国家只有成为充足的粮食储备的实际握有者的时候，才能在经济方面站稳脚步。”
    在工业方面，国家握有社会主义企业所生产的全部商品。同时，国家拥有用以发放信贷的银行，拥有铁路及其他公有化了的交通工具，因此就能同私营资本主义企业签订供应和按规定价格出售这些货物的合同。在实行正确的采购价格政策、发放定金和给予其他各种援助（肥料、生产工具等等）的情况下，国家就能成为轻工业和食品工业所需原料（棉花、羊毛、糖萝卜等农产品）的主要采购者和拥有者。国家手中有了原料，就能更有力地影响资本主义工业和商业的发展，使之走上社会主义建设所需要的方向。
    列宁曾教导说，在过渡时期的条件下，有组织地采购农产品，这并不是简单的买和卖，而是社会主义工业和小农经济的经济联系的一种形式。
    苏维埃国家不许私人贸易自由，进行为商业的社会化和掌握市场的斗争，并且把大批大批的货物集中到自己的手里。在新经济政策的第一年里，几乎四分之三的零售商品流转都在私商手里，而国营商业和合作社商业的有组织的市场总共只握有出售给消费者的商品的四分之一。过了几年之后，在一九二六—一九二七年，国家和合作社已经掌握了几近全部零售商品流转额的百分之七十（六十七点四），而私商市场部分则相应地下降到只占三分之一。
    在商业方面占有统治地位和做好商品流转（包括私商的商品流转在内）的调节工作，对于掌握市场是非常重要的。让小店主和最小的店主在某一时期内做生意吧。斯大林曾写道：“为了在贸易方面巩固起来，完全不需要把最后一个小店主从最后一个乡中挤出去，而只要把县变为苏维埃贸易的基地，使所有的小店主都不得不围绕县的合作社和苏维埃商店转，就像行星绕太阳一样。”
    为了能更好地掌握市场，苏联在国营的和合作社的商业组织之间有着一定的分工范围。国营企业主要是在大的批发商业中巩固自己的领导地位，它把工业和合作社联系起来，组织工业品的销售和供应企业以原料。列宁曾指出过，国家应当成为一个精明练达的批发商人，学会经商，使工业满足农民的需要。
    在一九二六—一九二七年，国营批发联合组织所经营的产品销售情况如下：在石油和盐的方面占百分之百、纺织品占百分之九十四点五、皮革占百分之八十七点五、榨油占百分之八十二点五、玻璃占百分之九一、瓷器、搪瓷占百分之九十八、火柴占百分之九十三点一、金属占百分之七十七点五。
    在零售商业方面起了主要的，日益增长的作用的，则是消费合作社。这是因为国家把大部分资金投入建设和发展工业、首先是重工业方面去了。当然，这并不是说国家完全放弃参与零售商业。国营商业组织网和流转额，在零售方面也发展了，但是它们在这方面不是主要的。国家通过信贷、特惠运价率、对供应居民需要的工业品和其他商品的优先发售等帮助了合作社。
    一九三一年，苏联的合作社已经掌握了全国零售商品流转的百分之七十以上，其余那一部分商品的出售是由国营商业组织来进行的。
    苏联建设社会主义的条件是非常困难的（经济上的破坏，没有任何外部的经济援助）。国家和合作社方面完全握有市场，几乎需要十五年的时间。在人民民主国家中，这个过程要比较快得多了。
            ×××
    由于在过渡时期有商品生产，价值规律也仍然存在着并发生作用。当产品是为出卖而生产时，生产产品所支付的劳动就必然有价值的形式，并通过商品的价格而表现出来。在社会主义建设中利用商业，不对价格加以调节是不行的，因为在市场上自由玩弄价格，也正像私营商业完全自由一样，是同计划原则完全相抵触的，它们只能促进资本主义的增长，不能促进社会主义的增长。
    由于在向社会主义过渡的时期社会的经济是多种成分的，所以整个经济的发展不可能直接服从于国家计划。国家是利用商业和价格机关来影响小商品成分和资本主义成分的发展的。
    正确的价格政策对调节私营成分的生产有着重大的意义。例如，如果对羊毛的采购价格不够高，对织成的毛织品的零售价格又较高，那么羊毛就会在农村停滞下来，被粗陋的方法加工成织品。如果在价格的对比关系上，大米和其他谷物作物的价格比棉花的价格较为有利，那么棉花的播种面积必然减少。如果农产品的价格全部都比工业品的价格低得多，这就会损害农民的购买力，使工业失去国内市场。如果私商的零售价格比合作社的低，那末，尽管合作社商店挂着怎么好的招牌，顾客还是要到私商那里去买商品。因此，合作化了的商业的发展，它同私商进行竞赛，它在社会主义建设中的作用，只有在规定出适当的价格标准和价格制度时，才能顺利地实现。
    正确地组织商业是巩固工农联盟的重要的经济手段。工农联盟，这不仅是政治上和道德上的联盟，而且还是建筑在两个阶级互利基础上的经济联盟。
    苏维埃俄国在新经济政策的最初几年里，正如约·维·斯大林当时所写的，有着这样一项任务：在市场和价格的基础上从新争取农民。以前，农民在工人阶级领导下为获得土地而斗争，其后，在内战时期，又为保卫这些土地，同国内外资本家和地主作斗争，但在战后，价格问题成为主要问题了——一方面是谷物、原料的价格，另一方面是工业品的价格。
    在计划规定价格时，苏维埃国家当然考虑到在革命年代中所发生的一切变化。例如，在一九二五年，由于减少了税和消灭了向地主缴付的地租，农民比革命前节省了几近二十亿卢布。因此，即使农业和工业恢复到战前的水平，农民对工业品的购买需要也会大大地高于革命前。
    苏联共产党同企图破坏正确价格政策的托洛茨基分子、布哈林分子及其他资本主义复辟者进行了尖锐的、紧张的斗争。托洛茨基分子曾提出无限制地提高工业品的价格，这必然会使农民破产，破坏城乡联系，甚而导致社会主义建设失败。布哈林分子曾为资本主义分子的利益主张市场上的完全自由，玩弄价格；完全拒绝利用价格来吸收大量农民收入作为促进国家工业化的一种手段。
    共产党第十五次代表大会在关于拟定第一个五年计划的指示中，对价格方面提出了在理论上和实践上都有着重大意义的指示。指示中说，不应当要求尽量动用农业资金来从事工业建设，因为这种动用不但会破坏工业的原料基地，城市和军队的粮食基地，而且会缩小国内市场，破坏工农联系。第十五次代表大会同时指出，如完全拒绝吸收农村大量增长的资金用来建设工业，这也是不正确的，因为这种拒绝会延缓工业化的速度，破坏市场的平衡而有损于我国的工业化。
    苏维埃国家在价格方面同私人资本主义分子进行了巨大斗争。这些私人资本主义分子力图用投机的抬高缺货价格的方法，捞取高额利润，损害劳动人民的利益来自肥。国家根据经济规律，规定了工业品的固定批发价格，规定了各种贸易形式对最重要的商品如糖、煤油、盐等的统一的零售价格。国家规定出对批发价格的最高限度的商业加价，国家通过国营批发组织和私商之间缔结合同的方法、以及发放给他们信贷等条件，强使他们按照不超过最高限度的价格来出售货物。
    国内各个阶级的利益在商业中反映出来，并且在商业中发生了冲突。在价格政策中交错着社会主义建设的一切最重要的经济的和政治的问题。
    在苏联进行社会主义建设时期，价格问题是特别复杂和尖锐的问题，因为当时需要在没有任何外援的情况下，迅速解决国家工业化、农业集体化和巩固国防等任务。目前，在建设着社会主义的各国里，由于有了世界民主市场，有了许多国家在经济发展方面的相互帮助和配合，在现有的和日益发展着的新的社会主义国际分工的条件下，许多问题都比较容易解决了。
            ×××
    从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时期，商业是新的、先进的同旧的、反动的进行最尖锐的斗争的场所。为了使社会主义获得胜利，作为旧形式的商业，应当充满新的内容，并为人民服务。正处在过渡时期的各国，在这一点上是具有客观条件的。但是把为了社会主义的胜利来利用商业的可能性变成使商业实际为人民服务，则要依靠国家的正确的政策、国家的全部经济组织活动和自觉地建设着社会主义的全体劳动人民的忘我劳动。
