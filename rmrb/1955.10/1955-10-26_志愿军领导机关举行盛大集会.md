Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 25th: The leading organ of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army held a grand gathering on the afternoon of the 25th to solemnly commemorate the 5th anniversary of the Volunteer Army's participation in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

More than 3,000 people attended the meeting, including leaders of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, representatives of various arms and services, and officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army's directly subordinate organs and troops.

Also attending the meeting were all members of the Korean People's Delegation headed by Vice Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Minister of National Defense, Vice Marshal Choi Yong-kun, and actors from the Korean National Choi Seung-hee Dance Institute who accompanied them.

Pan Zili, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was also invited to attend the meeting.

More than 400 representatives from the local Korean government, people, mines, Korean People's Army troops, and overseas Chinese in the area where the Volunteer Army's leading organ is stationed also attended the meeting.

The meeting began with the majestic song of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Li Zhimin, Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, spoke at the meeting. He first extended a warm welcome and high respect on behalf of all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the Korean People's Delegation headed by Vice Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Minister of National Defense, Vice Marshal Choi Yong-kun, who came to attend the meeting. Li Zhimin then said: Over the past five years, our Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in accordance with the entrustment of the people of the motherland, together with the heroic Korean people and the fraternal Korean People's Army, with the sympathy and support of the peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world, has won the victory in the war against our common enemy, the U.S. aggressors, inflicting heavy blows on the rampant aggressors. Since the armistice, we have made many efforts to ease the tension in the Korean region, consolidate peace in Korea, and strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Recently, after the previous thirteen divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were withdrawn to the motherland, we withdrew another six divisions to the motherland, once again expressing our sincerity in actively seeking a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. However, the U.S. aggressive bloc still opposes peace and is massively expanding, equipping, and training the Syngman Rhee bandit army. The South Korean authorities, with the support of the U.S. aggressive bloc, are constantly publicly clamoring to finally tear up the armistice agreement and re-launch a war of aggression. Li Zhimin said: The Korean armistice is still very unstable. All officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army must continue to consolidate and strengthen the unbreakable fighting friendship with the Korean people, vigilantly guard their positions together with the fraternal Korean People's Army, strictly abide by and maintain the armistice agreement, carry forward the army's honor and fine traditions, constantly improve their combat effectiveness, and strive for the final victory in order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, protect the socialist construction of the motherland, and defend peace in the Far East and the world.

Amidst warm applause and military music, Jeong No-sik, member of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland and Chairman of the Presidium, presented a flag to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on behalf of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland. Li Zhimin, Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, accepted the flag on behalf of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Vice Marshal Choi Yong-kun delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting. On behalf of the delegation, he expressed the whole nation's gratitude and honor to the great Chinese people and their government, the glorious Chinese Communist Party, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army for the enormous assistance they gave to the Korean people during the Korean War and after the war. Choi Yong-kun said that the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, nurtured by the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, together with the Korean People's Army, displayed an indomitable heroic spirit and unwavering spirit in the struggle against the common enemy, which not only defended the independence of the Korean state and the freedom of the people but also made a great contribution to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world. The glorious achievements made by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the Korean Liberation War and the noble qualities it displayed will always be respected by the Korean people and will be passed down to future generations along with the prosperity of the Korean nation. We will continue to work hard to strengthen the friendship and unity with the Chinese people and strive to make greater contributions to the cause of defending peace. Finally, Choi Yong-kun wished the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army new achievements in improving their combat strength.

Ambassador Pan Zili also spoke at the meeting, expressing his congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

Actors from the Korean National Choi Seung-hee Dance Institute will perform the Korean folk dance drama "The Story of Sado Castle" for the Volunteer Army officers and soldiers on the 26th.

    参加大会的还有以朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁副首相兼民族保卫相崔庸健次帅为首的朝鲜人民代表团的全体团员和随来的朝鲜国立崔承喜舞踊研究所的演员们。
    中华人民共和国驻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国特命全权大使潘自力也应邀参加了大会。
    志愿军领导机关驻地的朝鲜地方政府、人民、矿山、人民军部队和华侨也派出四百多名代表参加了大会。
    大会在雄壮的中国人民志愿军战歌声中开始。

    崔庸健次帅在会上致祝词。他以代表团的名义向在朝鲜战争期间和在战后给了朝鲜人民巨大援助的伟大的中国人民及其政府、光荣的中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席、英雄的中国人民志愿军致以全民的感谢和荣誉。崔庸健说，由中国共产党和毛泽东主席教养出来的英雄的中国人民志愿军，和朝鲜人民军一道，在抗击共同敌人的斗争中，发挥的不屈的英雄气概和刚毅精神，不仅保卫了朝鲜国家的独立和人民的自由，并且是对保卫亚洲及世界和平事业的莫大贡献。中国人民志愿军在朝鲜解放战争中树立的辉煌功绩和表现的高尚品质，将永远受到朝鲜人民的尊敬，它将和朝鲜国家的繁荣一起，被传颂给子孙万代。我们将继续努力加强和中国人民的友谊团结，争取为保卫和平事业作出更大的贡献。最后，崔庸健祝中国人民志愿军官兵在提高自己战斗力量的工作中，取得新的成就。
