Xinhua News Agency, October 4th. TASS, Paris, October 4th: Agence France-Presse, quoting well-informed sources, reported that the French government intends to postpone the visit of Prime Minister Faure and Foreign Minister Pinay to Moscow.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Paris newspapers generally criticize the French government's decision to postpone Prime Minister Faure and Foreign Minister Pinay's visit to Moscow. Even some right-wing newspapers, while attacking the Soviet Union, also believe that a visit to Moscow by French ministers could be beneficial under any circumstances. For example, "Le Monde" asked: Wouldn't it be better if this visit took place?

"Le Monde" published an article by the famous political commentator Maurice Duverger. This article argues that it is completely unreasonable for French politicians to postpone the visit to Moscow on the pretext of the Soviet Union's proposal at the United Nations to include the Algerian issue on the agenda of the General Assembly. This is merely "posturing" by French politicians.

The October 4th issue of "Paris People's News" also published an article stating that postponing Faure and Pinay's trip to Moscow is an attempt by the French ruling clique to find excuses and divert public opinion.

    法国政府打算推迟富尔访苏行期
    新华社四日讯　塔斯社巴黎四日讯：法新社引用消息灵通人士的话报道说，法国政府打算推迟总理富尔和外交部长比内前往莫斯科的行期。
    据新华社讯巴黎报纸普遍批评法国政府决定推迟总理富尔和外交部长比内访问莫斯科的行期。甚至某些右翼报纸一面在抨击苏联，一面也认为法国部长们访问莫斯科在任何情况下都可能是有好处的。例如“世界报”问道：如果进行这次访问，那不是更好些吗？
    “世界报”发表了著名政论家莫里斯·杜维歇的文章，这篇文章认为，法国政治家借口苏联在联合国主张把阿尔及利亚问题列入大会议程而延期访问莫斯科是完全没有理由的，这不过是法国政治家的“装腔作势”。
    十月四日的“巴黎人民报”也刊载了一篇文章，这篇文章说，推迟富尔与比内的莫斯科之行是法国统治集团寻找口实和转移舆论的一种企图。
