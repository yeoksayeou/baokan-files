To the Editor:

    My name is Li Ji'en, and I am a poor peasant from Sancun Village, Chengbei Township, Chengshan District, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province. There are eight people in my family, including my wife and me, and six children. During the land reform, my family was allocated seven mu of land. Because I am ill, and also because I didn't have a donkey or pig, and lacked farm tools, my production was poor. I could only harvest a little over 20 sheng of grain a year (25 jin per sheng), and had to rely on government relief to survive.

    In the winter of 1953, the village began to set up cooperatives. I had some thoughts about it, and after discussing it with my wife, we decided to join. However, the cadres in charge of setting up the cooperative at that time saw that I was ill and worried that I would not be able to work, so they told me to "wait until next year." A year passed, and the cooperative in our village increased production, strengthening my determination to join. When the old cooperative expanded this spring, I eagerly signed up. After discussion by the cooperative, they approved my joining. After joining the cooperative, although I was ill, I didn't know where the energy came from when I worked, and I didn't feel tired. This year, because the cooperative responded to the call from above and implemented intercropping, selected and replaced improved varieties, and increased the application of fertilizer, all kinds of crops increased production. Take corn as an example, the average yield per mu was 573 jin and 10 liang, an increase of 111 jin compared to last year, and an increase of 148 jin compared to ordinary farmers. Other miscellaneous grains also grew well. This year, I received a total of 1,132 jin of corn, rice, millet, etc., and the soybeans, sweet potatoes, and peanuts I will receive should also be considerable. My ancestors never harvested this much grain. I don’t have to worry about food this year. These are all the benefits that the cooperative has brought me. Without joining the cooperative, how could I earn so much grain! The cooperative is truly a bright path for peasants to go from poverty to prosperity.

### 不参加合作社哪能收入这么多粮食！

    不参加合作社哪能收入这么多粮食！编辑同志：
    我叫李际恩，是个贫农，山东荣成县成山区城北乡三村人。我家里除了两口子外，还有六个孩子。土地改革的时候，我家分了七亩土地。因为我身体有病，再说没驴没猪，农具又缺，所以生产搞不好，一年只能收入二十多升粮食（每升二十五斤），还要靠政府救济过日子。
    一九五三年冬天，村里开始办合作社了。我心里就有些活动，回家同妻子一商量，就拿定了主意要入社。但是，当时领导办社的工作人员见我的身体有病，怕我做不了活，就要我“等着明年再说”。一年的光景过去了，我们村的合作社增了产，我入社的决心更强了。等到今年春天扩大老社的时候，我就急忙报了名。经过社里讨论，通过了让我入社。入社以后，我虽然有病，但是干活时不知道那里来的劲头，也觉不出来累。今年社里由于响应了上级号召，实行了间作，选换良种，增施肥料，各种庄稼都增了产。就拿苞米来说吧，平均每亩产五百七十三斤十两，比去年增产一百十一斤，比一般农民增产一百四十八斤；其他杂粮长的也不错。我今年一共分了苞米、稻子、谷子等一千一百三十二斤，还有大豆、地瓜、花生估计也不能少分了。我老辈也没有打过这些粮，今年吃的就不用愁了。这都是合作社给我带来的好处，不参加合作社哪能收入这么多粮食。合作社真是农民由穷到富的一条必经的光明大道啊。　李际恩
