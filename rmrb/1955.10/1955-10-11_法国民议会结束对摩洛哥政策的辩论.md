Xinhua News Agency, Paris: The French National Assembly concluded on the 9th its debate on the French government's policy towards Morocco, according to TASS.

    French Prime Minister Faure explained the government's policy on the Moroccan issue at the meeting on the 8th. He pointed out that in the two years since Sultan Yusuf was deposed, no reforms had been carried out in Morocco. Faure said, "It is now very clear that political progress in Morocco is impossible without the participation of nationalist forces." Faure advocated the establishment of a Regency Council in Morocco.

    Faure pointed out that now all colonial peoples are demanding independence, but he believes that "independence should be granted to them in stages." Faure believes that the future relationship between France and Morocco should be based on the principle of "independence within the scope of mutual dependence."

    Deputy André Denis (not belonging to any parliamentary group), speaking, asked the government to implement the Aix-les-Bains plan for resolving the Moroccan problem, which it had drafted during negotiations with representatives of some Moroccan nationalist parties.

    Bouber de Chambellan, a member of the "Progressive Republican Union" who spoke next, strongly condemned the policy of colonial oppression. He also pointed out that this policy can only bring adverse consequences. De Chambellan called for an end to the dispatch of French troops to North Africa and advocated a policy of negotiating with representatives of local residents who are entitled to represent these countries.

    After speeches by several deputies, the National Assembly passed a proposal by Socialist Deputy Depreux by 477 votes to 140. This proposal endorsed the Aix-les-Bains Agreement and called for the immediate establishment of a Regency Council in Morocco and the establishment of a representative Moroccan government. Communist deputies also voted in favor of the proposal.

    法国民议会结束对摩洛哥政策的辩论
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国国民议会九日结束了关于法国政府对摩洛哥政策的辩论。
    法国总理富尔在八日会议上说明政府对摩洛哥问题的政策。他指出，在苏丹优素福被废黜后的两年内，摩洛哥没有进行过任何改革。富尔说，“现在十分明显，没有民族主义力量的参加，摩洛哥在政治上的进步是不可能的”。富尔主张在摩洛哥成立王位委员会。
    富尔指出，现在，所有殖民地人民都在要求独立，但是他认为，“应当分阶段来给予他们独立”。富尔认为，法国和摩洛哥今后的关系应当以“在互相依赖的范围内的独立”的原则为基础。
    议员安德烈·德尼（不属于任何议会党团）发言时，要求政府执行它同摩洛哥一些民族主义政党的代表谈判时拟定的解决摩洛哥问题的艾克斯—勒—巴恩计划。
    接着发言的“进步共和联盟”议员布伯尔·德香布兰坚决指责殖民压迫政策。他并且指出，这一政策只能带来不良的后果。德香布兰要求停止派遣法国军队前往北非，并且主张实行同有权代表这些国家的当地居民的代表进行谈判的政策。
    在一些议员发言后，国民议会以四百七十七票对一百四十票通过社会党议员德普勒的提案，这个提案赞同艾克斯—勒—巴恩协定，要求立刻在摩洛哥建立王位委员会和成立代议制摩洛哥政府。共产党议员也投票赞成这个提案。
