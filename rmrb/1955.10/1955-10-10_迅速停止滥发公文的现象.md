    An Important Instruction Without an Official Seal

    Editor:
    On August 20th, the Shenyang Battery Factory received an instruction letter from the Labor and Wage Department of the Electric Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, dated August 19th, regarding the "Reply on the Fourth Quarter Labor Indicators." After the secretary of the factory office read it, he handed it to the factory director. The factory director instructed the secretary to pass the document to the planning section. The head of the planning section read the document several times before giving it to the planning team leader. According to the instructions of the section chief, the planning team leader handed the document to the planner for detailed study to start compiling the fourth quarter labor plan. The head of the Labor and Wage Section, upon hearing that the labor indicators had been approved, happily borrowed the document from the planning section and gave it to the labor organizer to start preparing and compiling the relevant materials for the plan.
    On August 29th, the factory received another notice from the bureau, saying that the document issued on the 19th had no official seal and should be returned to be sealed and reissued. At this point, the comrades in the factory hurriedly checked the document and found that it was indeed without a seal.
    It is a serious act of negligence for the Electric Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building to send an important document without an official seal to its subordinate factories. However, it is also surprising that this document passed through seven checkpoints in the Shenyang Battery Factory—factory director, secretary, head of the planning section, planning team leader, planner, head of the labor and wage section, and labor organizer—without anyone noticing that it had no official seal.

    A Telegram Sent to More Than Two Thousand Units

    Editor:
    Not long ago, the Liuzhou Railway Bureau's Business Section received an urgent telegram from the Jiamusi Branch Bureau of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau. The telegram stated: Due to flood damage between Yichun Station and Wuying Station on the Tanglin Line, passenger and freight transport is suspended. This telegram was not only sent to the Liuzhou Railway Bureau but also to more than two thousand units, including all railway bureaus, branch bureaus, and railway business stations nationwide.
    The purpose of the Jiamusi Railway Branch Bureau in sending this telegram was to notify other stations not to accept goods destined for stations in the flood-affected area. However, the route from Yichun Station to Wuying Station is a very remote one, and few large quantities of goods are transported to Yichun and Wuying from the southern, northwestern, and southwestern regions; moreover, many stations do not yet handle direct railway transport. Therefore, it is obviously unnecessary to send such a telegram universally to all stations nationwide. According to regulations, the Jiamusi Railway Branch Bureau should have reported the flood damage to the higher-level bureau and relevant leading departments for handling, and should not have sent such a telegram to all bureaus and stations nationwide without authorization.
    This practice of abusively sending telegrams has caused a great waste. This telegram contained more than seventy characters, and at an average cost of six fen per character, sending it to more than two thousand units would cost more than ten thousand yuan in telegram fees. Such waste cannot be tolerated.

    Bureaucratic "Notice"

    Editor:
    On August 11th of this year, the General Office of the Ministry of Light Industry issued a notice because the Paper Industry Administration Bureau, the Sugar and Wine Industry Administration Bureau, and the Food Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry moved to new offices. This notice was primarily sent to nearly forty agencies, including the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, various ministries, commissions, offices, and directly affiliated institutions of the State Council, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the People's Committees and Industrial Bureaus of various provinces, and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and various democratic parties. Within the ministry, the receiving units included various directly affiliated units, bureaus, companies, offices, experimental institutes, schools, and enterprises. Furthermore, it was also distributed to the offices and directly affiliated institutions of these units; after receiving the document, each unit had to notify the institutions in various provinces and cities separately. Therefore, if the total number of receiving units is calculated, it will be several hundred.
    Is it necessary to notify so many units mentioned above about the "relocation" of the three bureaus of the Ministry of Light Industry? Obviously, it is not necessary; even if it were necessary, wouldn't publishing a notice in the newspaper be both timely and economical?

    Purchased Enough Stationery for Sixteen Years

    Editor:
    I am a staff member of the Shanxi Provincial Timber Company. Not long ago, while I was working in the warehouse, the Printing Production Cooperative delivered a truckload of stationery, totaling one thousand notebooks. I thought it might have been printed on behalf of subordinate units, but when I picked up a notebook, I saw that it was printed with the words "Shanxi Provincial Timber Company."
    Calculating, our company used a total of five notebooks of stationery in July. Therefore, one thousand notebooks would be enough for sixteen years—not even finished after the completion of three Five-Year Plans. In the past, due to multiple changes in organization and name, our company had already had enough various official papers and stationery left over. Instead of trying to utilize these old papers, the relevant personnel are creating new waste, which cannot be tolerated!

### 迅速停止滥发公文的现象

    迅速停止滥发公文的现象
    没有盖公章的重要指示编辑同志：
    八月二十日，沈阳电池厂接到第一机械工业部电器工业管理局劳动工资处八月十九日发的“关于批复第四季度劳动指标”的指示公函。 厂部秘书看后交给厂长。厂长吩咐秘书把文件批交计划科。计划科长把文件连续看了几遍，才交给计划组组长。计划组组长根据科长的指示，把文件交给计划员详细研究，着手编制第四季度劳动计划。劳动工资科科长听说劳动指标批复回来了，就兴高采烈地到计划科把文件借去，交给劳动组织员开始准备整理编制计划的有关资料。
    八月二十九日，这个厂又接到局里的一个通知，说是十九日发的那件文件没盖公章，要退回加盖公章后重发。这时，厂里这些同志急忙查出文件来看，果然是没有公章的。
    第一机械工业部电器工业管理局把没盖公章的重要文件发给所属工厂，这种疏忽大意的行为是严重的。但是，这个文件在沈阳电池厂经过厂长、秘书、计划科长、计划组长、计划员、劳动工资科长、劳动组织员等七道关口，都没有发现它是没有盖公章，也是令人吃惊的现象。

    发给两千多个单位的电报编辑同志：
    不久以前，柳州铁路管理局商务处接到齐齐哈尔铁路管理局佳木斯分局发出的一份紧急电报。电报内容是：汤林线伊春站至五营站间发生水害，暂停客货运输。这份电报不仅发给了柳州铁路管理局，还发给全国各铁路管理局、分局和各铁路营业车站共两千多个单位。
    佳木斯铁路分局拍发这份电报的目的是为了通知其他车站不承运发往水害地区各站的货物。但是，伊春站到五营站是一段很偏僻的路线，南方、西北、西南地区是很少有大批货物运到伊春和五营去的；特别是有许多车站现在还不办理铁路直通运输，因此向全国各车站普遍发这样的电报显然是不必要的。按规定，佳木斯铁路分局在发现水害以后应该报请上级管理局和有关领导部门处理，不应擅自向全国各管理局和车站发这样的电报。
    这种滥发电报的做法造成了很大的浪费。这份电报共有七十多个字，每个字平均以人民币六分计算，发两千多份就要一万多元的电报费。这种浪费是不能容许的。　　　　             谢特生
    文牍主义的“通知”编辑同志：
    今年八月十一日，轻工业部办公厅因为轻工业部所属的造纸工业管理局、糖酒工业管理局和食品工业管理局迁移到新址办公，就发了一个通知。这个通知主送给全国人民代表大会常务委员会办公厅，人民政协全国委员会，国务院各部、会、各办公室、各直属机构，最高人民法院，最高人民检察院，中国科学院，各省人民委员会和工业厅，中共中央和各民主党派等将近四十多个机关。在本部内受文的单位有各直属单位、各局、各公司、各办事处、各试验所、各学校、各企业，同时还是分送这些单位的各办公室和各直属机构的；各单位收文后，又得分别通知各省市的机构。因此，如果把受文单位总的计算起来，将有好几百个。
    轻工业部所属三个局“乔迁”，是不是有必要通知上述那末许多单位呢？显然，是没有什么必要的；即使必要的话，在报纸上刊登一个通告，不是又及时又节省吗？

    购买了够用十六年的信纸编辑同志：
    我是山西省木材公司的一个工作人员。不久前的一天，我正在仓库工作，印刷生产合作社送来了一车信纸，一共有一千本。我想这可能是给下属单位代印的，但拿起信纸一看，上边都印着“山西省木材公司”的字样。
    计算一下，七月份我们公司共用了五本信纸，那末，一千本信纸足够使用十六年——到三个五年计划完成以后还用不完。我们公司过去由于机构和名称多次变更，剩下来的各种公文纸和信笺已经够多了。有关人员不但不设法利用这些旧纸，相反地还在造成新的浪费，这是不能容许的！
