Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 15th -- A joint communiqué was issued after the talks between the Lao Kingdom government delegation and the Lao Fighting Units delegation in Rangoon on the 13th:

    The talks between the Lao Kingdom government delegation headed by Mr. Kat Sassorith and the Lao delegation headed by Prince Souphanouvong, which began on October 9, 1955, ended on October 13, 1955.

    The heads of both delegations extensively compared and discussed their respective draft resolutions and counter-proposals, which has brought many different viewpoints closer together. In a spirit of mutual understanding, both sides signed an important agreement on October 11, 1955, on the cessation of hostilities in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly.

    Regarding further agreements needed on other issues on the agenda jointly formulated by both parties, both sides agreed to entrust them to the political conference currently working in Vientiane for discussion and finalization. This conference should complete this task in the shortest possible time. If necessary, Mr. Kat Sassorith and Prince Souphanouvong may meet again to reaffirm the spirit of sincere cooperation and strict and full implementation of the Geneva Accords.

    The talks were conducted throughout in an atmosphere of the utmost sincerity, full mutual understanding, and cooperation.

    A large part of these encouraging results is due to the active and valuable assistance given by Ambassador S. Saens and the International Commission, as well as the kind reception by the Government of the Union of Burma, the Burmese people, and the residents of Rangoon, and the care of the Indian Embassy in Burma.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th -- The Lao Fighting Units delegation headed by Prince Souphanouvong arrived in Hanoi by plane at 1:00 PM on the 14th after concluding the Rangoon talks.

    Souphanouvong stated at the airport that some results had been achieved during the five days of talks in Rangoon. The most important was the agreement signed on October 11 on the cessation of military action, which was also a result of the Vientiane military conference. In addition, the talks have brought the opinions of both sides on many issues on the agenda into agreement or closer proximity, and both sides agreed to hand these issues over to the Vientiane political conference for further discussion. The talks were conducted in an atmosphere of closeness, frankness, and sincerity, enabling both sides to better understand each other and see the necessity of close mutual cooperation.

    Souphanouvong said that due to the signing of the agreement, the efforts of the Lao Fighting Units delegation, the support of the entire Lao people, and the cooperation of the Kingdom government, he believed that the situation in Laos would be eased.

    Souphanouvong expressed gratitude to the International Commission, which organized the talks and paid attention to helping the meeting achieve the above results.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th -- The Lao Fighting Units delegation headed by Souphanouvong left Hanoi by plane at 2:30 PM on the 15th to return to Sam Neua, Laos.

    Souphanouvong stated at the airport that the Lao Fighting Units will thoroughly implement the agreement just signed in Rangoon, will strive to implement the Geneva Accords, to achieve the independence and democracy of Laos, and to contribute to the consolidation of peace in Indochina and the world.

    双方代表团长久地比较和讨论各自提出的决议草案和对案，已经使许多不同的观点得到接近，根据互相谅解的精神，双方已经在一九五五年十月十一日就停止桑怒和丰沙里两省的敌对行动签订了一项重要的协议。

    这次会谈自始至终是在最诚挚的和充分的互相谅解和合作的气氛中进行的。
    所获得的这些令人鼓舞的结果很大一部分要归功于斯·塞恩大使先生和国际委员会所给予的积极和宝贵的帮助，以及缅甸联邦政府、缅甸人民和仰光居民的善意接待以及印度驻缅甸大使馆的关怀。

    苏发努冯说，由于协议得到签订，由于寮国战斗部队代表团的努力，由于老挝全体人民的支持和王国政府方面的合作，我相信老挝局势会得到缓和。
    苏发努冯表示感谢国际委员会，它组织了这次会谈并且注意帮助会议得到上述结果。
