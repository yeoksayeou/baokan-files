    Six Years
    Yang Shuo
    October is truly a wonderful season. From the beginning of spring, farmers labor diligently, seeing the stars and wearing the moon. Now the land is covered in gold, it is the time of the great harvest.

    October is also the great harvest of the Chinese people's revolution. The Chinese people, with their lives and sweat, waged a hundred years of struggle, falling and rising again, failing and starting anew, pressing forward wave upon wave, until finally, on this day six years ago, they obtained the harvest we had longed for day and night, and established the new People's Republic of China.

    I cannot forget October 1, 1949, and we should never forget it. On that day, the bright Five-Star Red Flag fluttered and rose into the sky, the salutes boomed, and the military band played the stirring national anthem. Our most beloved Comrade Mao Zedong stood on Tiananmen and solemnly announced to the world: "The Chinese people have stood up!" I could no longer hold back, and tears streamed down my face. I cried—I shed tears of joy.

    The scene in front of Tiananmen is the epitome of modern Chinese history. Look, the endless crowds are like the Yangtze River, flowing towards Tiananmen. On Tiananmen stand the leaders of our Party, stand Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, with a smile, waves to the crowd, and the crowd cheers and advances in the direction he indicates. For decades, it is by relying on the guidance of the Party that the people broke through the darkest period in history and finally achieved victory in the revolutionary war; for six years, the people have been moving towards the goals set for us by the Party, gradually realizing their ideals and building our motherland.

    Every year on October 1st, the flow of people in front of Tiananmen in Beijing advances mightily, and Chinese history also advances.

    I see our powerful army, navy, and air force surge forward, and I feel that I know them. I do know them. I once walked with them for a while, and I understand their yesterday. They came from a very, very distant yesterday. They once wore straw sandals, held guns, crossed snow-capped mountains, and crossed grasslands, fighting as they walked, walking as they fought, some falling, more joining in, until they reached the victorious today. War is not their purpose; freedom and peace are their sincere wishes. I know how high a price our people have paid for freedom and for peace. We must protect the free and happy life we have exchanged with our lives with all our lives!

    At the same time, we also know how to use all our strength to build our own cause. Six years, this is not a simple number, it contains the people's rich creation, contains our precious harvest. In the past six years, we built "Anshan Iron and Steel," harnessed the Huai River, and built the Kangzang Highway. ... Construction projects are truly like the beautiful scenery of spring, blooming everywhere on our land.

    But we are not complacent with this, we have even more beautiful ideals. What we want to build is a large-scale socialist and communist cause—the existing construction is far from enough. How should we realize this most beautiful ideal? The Party has already hung up a guiding light on our way forward. The Party has prescribed the first stage of the road to socialist construction for us. This is the first Five-Year Plan.

    In order to realize this plan, from south to north, from east to west, countless construction experts have emerged everywhere. They are all ordinary workers, farmers, and intellectuals, converging into a mighty construction army.

    In the construction army, there are countless young activists.

    Here is Tong Fengming, a steelmaking expert from Benxi, Northeast China. This capable young man leads the production team, everyone is as united as one, and the technology is high. Even in the difficult autumn rainy season for steelmaking, every furnace produces high-quality pure steel. Not only do they make good steel, but they also make it quickly. What they contribute to the country in excess is the most needed steel, and they themselves are the steel for building the country.

    Here is Moro, a Tibetan youth from the Kangzang Plateau. He is the representative of the Tibetan Youth Shock Team of the Danba Mica Mine. How did this Tibetan, who had previously lived a painful life under the whip of others, greet his new life? It is best to let his own actions answer.

    In the winter of 1954, a landslide occurred at a construction site, which temporarily prevented mining from continuing and seriously affected the annual production task of mica. Moro's shock team was very anxious and repeatedly requested, and finally the Party committee allowed them to transfer to Gaoding Mountain for mining. Gaoding Mountain is more than 4,000 meters above sea level. The mountain is covered with three feet of snow, which completely buries the mine. The air on the top of the mountain is also thin, making it difficult to breathe. As soon as the shock team went up the mountain, they swept the snow to open the road and immediately started production. Everyone's hands and faces were frozen and bleeding, and some people's hands were covered with cracks and covered with tape. But they refused to go down the mountain. For forty days, they braved the strong wind and heavy snow and finally overfulfilled the production task, and even completed it ahead of schedule. What force encourages them to do this? Moro told us a team member's words: "When I think of building socialism, my energy is great..." This is of course Moro's own words.

    Here is also a female surveying team member from Yumen Oilfield on the Gobi Desert in Northwest China, only nineteen years old, named Huang Jinhong. Her surveying team has twenty or thirty people, all of whom are women, and almost all of them are students. The Gobi Desert is not a fun place, full of sand and rocks, no trees, and no people. This female surveying team was not deterred at all. They went deep into the desert, climbed the cliffs of the Qilian Mountains, and collected oil veins for the motherland everywhere. In the Gobi, as soon as the weather changes, a yellow wind suddenly rolls up on the flat ground, followed by a rainstorm, mixed with hailstones. At this time, they are measuring in the wild. What if the hailstones fall on the instruments and damage them? Everyone quickly took off their cotton clothes and wrapped the instruments and charts. As for themselves, who cares whether they are cold or not? If you ask what force supports them to do this, they will surely say the same thing as Moro.

    I just casually pointed out these three people, but in fact, in the ranks of progress, how many thousands upon thousands of people like this are there. These thousands upon thousands of people have the same ideals, come from all ethnic groups, from all walks of life, from factories and mines everywhere, from the vast rural areas of the country. Agricultural production cooperatives are like flowers and plants in spring, which will soon bloom brilliantly everywhere. We can't name those thousands upon thousands of people, but we know that they have a common name, and that is "the people."

    It is the people who created the thousands of years of history of our motherland, and are now creating a new era-making history. The great ranks of people who have been cheering and advancing in front of Tiananmen in Beijing and other places every October 1st for the past six years are precisely the people's army building socialism.

    October 1st, this is not an ordinary day, this is a milestone for the Chinese people to move towards communism. We have been walking for six years, and we will continue to walk year after year. Once a beautiful ideal is realized, we must strive for a more beautiful ideal. The people are always moving forward with ideals.

    六年
    杨朔
    十月真是个好季节。从打春起，农民披星星，戴月亮，辛辛苦苦地劳动。现在是满地黄金，到了大秋的时候了。
    十月也是中国人民革命的大秋。中国人民用生命，用血汗，进行了上百年的斗争，跌倒了爬起来，失败了重新开始，前仆后继，终于在六年前的今天，得到了我们日夜想望着的收成，成立了崭新的中华人民共和国。
    我不能忘记一九四九年十月一日那天，我们永远也不应该忘记。那天，鲜亮的五星红旗飘飘扬扬升到半空，礼炮响了，军乐奏起激昂的国歌。我们最爱的人毛泽东同志站在天安门上，对全世界庄严地宣布说：“中国人民站起来了！”我再也忍不住，眼泪唰地流下来。我哭了——我流的是欢乐的眼泪。
    天安门前的光景就是中国现代历史的缩影。你瞧吧，望不断的人群好像长江大河，冲着天安门流去。天安门上立着我们党的领袖们，立着毛主席。毛主席含着微笑，向人群招手，人群就冲着他招引的方向，欢呼着前进。几十年来，就是靠着党的指引，人民突破了历史上最黑暗的时期，终于取得了革命战争的胜利；六年以来，人民又向着党给我们指出的目标，逐步实现自己的理想，建设我们的祖国。
    每年十月一日北京天安门前的人流在浩浩荡荡地前进，中国的历史也在前进。
    我看见我们强大的海陆空军部队涌过来，我觉得我认识他们。我是认识他们的。我曾经跟他们走过一段路，我懂得他们的昨天。他们是从很远很远的昨天走过来的。他们曾经穿着草鞋，握着枪，翻过雪山，越过草地，一边打一边走，一边走一边打，有的人倒下去了，更多的人参加进来，一直走到了胜利的今天。战争并不是他们的目的，自由、和平才是他们真心的愿望。我知道，我们的人民为着自由，为着和平，曾经付出了多么高贵的代价。我们用生命换来的自由幸福的生活，一定要用全生命去保卫它！
    同时我们也懂得怎样用全力去建设自己的事业。六年，这不是个简单的数目字，这里边包含着人民的丰富的创造，包含着我们的珍贵的收获。六年来，我们建设了“鞍钢”，治了淮河，修了康藏公路。………建设事业在我们的国土上真像三春好景，遍地开花。
    可是我们并不以此自满，我们有更美的理想。我们要建设的是规模宏大的社会主义、共产主义事业，——现有的建设还差的远呢。应该怎样去实现这种最美的理想呢？党已经在我们前进的路上悬起指路的明灯。党为我们规定了社会主义建设的第一段路程。这就是第一个五年计划。
    为着实现这个计划，从南到北，从东到西，到处出现了数不尽的建设能手。他们都是些普普通通的工人、农民、知识分子，汇合成浩浩荡荡的建设大军。
    在建设大军中，有数不清的青年积极分子。
    这里有东北本溪的炼钢好手佟凤鸣。这个能干的小伙子带领着生产小组，大家团结得像一个人似的，技术又高，就是在炼钢顶困难的秋雨季节，每炉出的也都是上好的纯钢。他们不但炼的钢好，还炼得快。他们超额献给国家的是最需要的钢，他们本身就是建设国家的钢材。
    这里有康藏高原的藏族青年莫洛。他是丹巴云母矿藏族青年突击队的代表。这个先前一直在旁人的皮鞭梢下过着痛苦日子的藏民是怎样迎接他的新生活呢？最好让他自己的行动来做回答。
    一九五四年冬天，有个工地发生山崩，一时不能继续开采，严重影响了云母全年的生产任务。莫洛率领的突击队急得很，一再要求，最后党委才许他们转到高顶山上去开采。高顶山拔海四千多公尺高。山上大雪有三尺深，把矿埋得严严实实。山顶空气又稀，喘气都吃力。突击队一上山，扫雪开路，立刻着手生产。大家的手脸冻得出血，有人的双手裂满了口子，贴的净是胶布。可是他们不肯下山。前后四十天，他们冒着大风大雪，终于超额完成生产任务，而且还是提前完成。是什么力量鼓舞着他们这样做呢？莫洛告诉我们一个队员的话：“想起建设社会主义，我的劲头就大……”这当然也是莫洛自己的话。
    这里还有大西北戈壁滩上玉门油矿的一个女测量队员，才十九岁，叫黄金洪。她所属的测量队有二三十人，都是女的，出身差不多全是学生。戈壁滩并非好玩的地方，满眼砂石，不见树木，不见人烟。这个女子测量队一点都不曾被吓退。她们深入大漠，攀登着祁连山的悬崖峭壁，四处替祖国采测油脉。在戈壁上，说声变天，平地忽然卷起黄风，紧接着是一场暴雨，还夹杂着冰雹子。这时她们正在野地测量，冰雹子落到仪器上，万一砸坏，可怎么好？大家赶紧脱下棉衣，把仪器和图表包好，至于她们本身，谁还管冷不冷呢。你要问是什么力量支持她们这样做，她们准会说出像莫洛嘴里一样的话。
    我不过随便指出这么三个人，其实在前进的行列里，像这样的人何止千千万万。这千千万万人都怀着同样的理想，来自各民族、来自各行业、来自各地的工厂矿山，来自全国广大的农村。农业生产合作社正像春天的花草，遍地将要开得一片灿烂。我们叫不上那千千万万人的名字，但我们知道他们有个共同的名字，这就是“人民”。
    是人民创造了我们祖国几千年的历史，现时正在创造着划时代的新历史。那六年来每年十月一日都在北京天安门前和其他各地欢呼前进着的伟大的行列，正是建设社会主义的人民大军。
    十月一日，这不是个等闲的日子，这是中国人民向共产主义迈进的里程碑。我们已经走了六年，我们还要一年一年地走下去。一个美的理想实现了，又得为更美的理想而奋斗。人民是永远怀着理想前进的。
