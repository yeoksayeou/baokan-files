    The Jining-Erlian railway line has entered winter construction. It has already snowed in the Saihantala area, and the temperature has dropped to minus six degrees Celsius. Workers doing roofing and bricklaying at the power plant here are using steam curing to ensure the houses are built well. All employees are confidently guaranteeing the completion of the remaining station track laying, mechanical installation, power equipment, and regional communication projects.
    Currently, the main structure of production houses along the line has been basically completed. The ballast for the entire main line has been laid. Signal installation and mechanical installation are proceeding intensely. In order to install the technically complex machinery well, employees from units such as the Jining Machinery Repair Plant and the Jining Locomotive Depot have formed eleven specialized installation teams or groups for circuit wiring, replacement, locomotive maintenance, and water supply, working intensely along the Jining-Erlian line.

    集二线开始冬季施工
    集二线已进入冬季施工。赛汗塔拉地区已经下雪，气温降到摄氏零下六度。正在这里发电厂做屋面和砌墙的工人，采用蒸汽养生法，保证把房子盖好。全体职工正信心百倍地保证把仅余的站场铺轨、机械安装、动力设备和地区通讯等工程完成。
    现在，沿线生产房屋的主体工程已基本完工。全线正线道碴已经铺好。信号安装和机械安装正在紧张进行。为了把技术复杂的各种机械安装好，集宁机械修配厂和集宁机务段等单位的职工组成电路配线、换装、机务、给水等十一个专业安装队或组，在集二沿线紧张地工作。
