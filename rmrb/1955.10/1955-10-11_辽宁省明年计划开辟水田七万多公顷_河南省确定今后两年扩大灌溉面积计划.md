Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, October 10th: Liaoning Province will continue to open up more than 70,000 hectares of paddy fields next year to expand the planting area of rice. This was determined at the recent Liaoning Provincial Farmland Water Conservancy Work Conference.

Liaoning Province has many rivers and abundant water sources. After each hectare of dry land is converted into paddy fields for rice cultivation, grain production can be greatly increased. Since liberation, with the promotion of the People's Government and the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the area of paddy fields has increased every year. In 1950, the province had only more than 75,000 hectares of paddy fields. Currently, the province has more than 123,000 hectares of paddy fields. Many waterlogged and alkaline wastelands have been turned into high-yielding fields after being opened up as paddy fields.

Liaoning Province opened up more than 31,000 hectares of new paddy fields this year, and the rice planted has generally achieved a bumper harvest. The average yield per hectare of ordinary rice fields can reach 6,000 to 7,000 jin. It is estimated that all the newly opened rice fields can produce at least 80,000 tons of rice, accounting for 26 percent of the province's grain production increase task this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, October 10th: Henan Province has determined that it will expand the water conservancy irrigation area by 10 million mu by 1957. More than 500,000 mu will be expanded this winter.

At present, the water conservancy irrigation area in Henan Province has developed to more than 14.51 million mu, accounting for more than 10 percent of the total cultivated land area in the province. However, the development of farmland water conservancy is far from keeping up with the needs of developing agricultural production. According to the instructions of the State Council and the resolution of the Third Session of the Henan Provincial People's Congress, Henan Province should expand the irrigation area by 10 million mu from now until the end of 1957. In order to complete and overfulfill this task, the Henan Provincial People's Committee convened a provincial water conservancy conference at the end of September and made specific arrangements.

The main method of expanding the irrigation area is to focus on the development of wells and springs with less investment and quick returns, and then cooperate with the excavation of large and small channels, the construction of ponds, weirs, and dams, the construction of small reservoirs, and the addition of water pumps. After the task of expanding the irrigation area by 10 million mu is completed by the end of 1957, the province's irrigation area will reach more than 24.5 million mu, close to 18 percent of the total cultivated land area.

    辽宁省明年计划开辟水田七万多公顷
    河南省确定今后两年扩大灌溉面积计划
    据新华社沈阳十日电　辽宁省明年将继续开辟水田七万多公顷，来扩大水稻的种植面积。这是在最近举行的辽宁省农田水利工作会议上确定的。
    辽宁省境内河流较多，水源充足，每一公顷旱地改成水田种稻后可增产很多粮食。解放后在人民政府提倡和互助合作组织发展的情况下，每年水田面积都有增加。一九五○年全省水田只有七万五千多公顷，目前全省水田已达十二万三千多公顷。许多涝洼地和碱荒地开成水田后，变成了高产田。
    辽宁省今年新开水田三万一千多公顷，所种水稻普遍丰收。一般的稻田每公顷平均可产六、七千斤。全部新开的水稻田估计最少可产稻谷八万吨，占今年全省粮食增产任务的百分之二十六。
    据新华社郑州十日电　河南省确定到一九五七年要扩大水利灌溉面积一千万亩。今冬要扩大五十多万亩。
    目前河南省的水利灌溉面积已发展到一千四百五十一万多亩，占全省耕地总面积的百分之十强。但是，农田水利的发展还远赶不上发展农业生产的需要。根据国务院的指示和河南省人民代表大会第三次会议的决议，河南省从现在起到一九五七年年底，应扩大灌溉面积一千万亩。河南省人民委员会为了完成和超额完成这项任务，在九月底召开了全省水利会议，作了具体部署。
    扩大灌溉面积的主要办法是以发展投资少、收益快的井泉为主，再配合开挖大小型渠道，修筑塘、堰、坝，兴建小型水库，增设抽水机。扩大灌溉面积一千万亩的任务到一九五七年年底完成后，全省的灌溉面积就达到二千四百五十多万亩，接近耕地总面积的百分之十八。
