To all ethnic compatriots and comrades in Xinjiang:

    The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has been solemnly declared established today, the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, according to the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and after discussion and adoption by the Second Session of the First People's Congress of Xinjiang Province. The establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is another great victory for the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policy, a historically significant event for the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland in the cause of socialist construction, a major achievement in the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy by the state in accordance with the Constitution, and a major event in the political life of the Uyghur people and all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, I extend warm congratulations to the Uyghur people and all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

    Over the past six years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the united efforts of the Xinjiang Branch of the CPC Central Committee, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang, and the people of all ethnic groups, significant achievements have been made in all aspects of work, various construction undertakings have developed rapidly, the lives of the people of all ethnic groups have been considerably improved and elevated, and tens of thousands of cadres from all ethnic groups have grown up, actively striving and completing the tasks assigned to them by the motherland and the people in various work positions, fundamentally changing the old ethnic relations in Xinjiang and bringing about tremendous changes in all aspects, transforming the entire old face of Xinjiang.

    The establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is the common aspiration of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Now this aspiration has been realized, and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has been established. We firmly believe that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will certainly make every effort to consolidate and build the autonomous region. Cherishing and building the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is first and foremost the common responsibility of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and it is also the responsibility of all ethnic groups throughout the country.

    The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was established under the close care of our great motherland and Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups, and with the brotherly assistance of the people of all ethnic groups in the great family of the motherland. We firmly believe that after the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will certainly continue to receive the care and support of the motherland and will be able to further strengthen the unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance among the fraternal ethnic groups in the great family of the motherland. Our great motherland, which is increasingly moving towards prosperity and strength, is the most reliable guarantee for the happy life of the people of all ethnic groups.

    The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was established on the basis of unity, mutual assistance, and joint efforts among the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. We firmly believe that after the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will certainly be able to further strengthen unity and mutual assistance within Xinjiang and among the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Unity and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups, unity and mutual assistance within each ethnic group, unity and mutual assistance between ethnic groups with large populations and ethnic groups with small populations, and unity and mutual assistance between ethnic groups with relatively advanced economic and cultural development and ethnic groups with relatively backward economic and cultural development are the strongest forces for building the autonomous region and smoothly carrying out the cause of socialist construction.

    I congratulate the hardworking and brave people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang on achieving even more glorious achievements and a more fulfilling and happy life in the future implementation of regional autonomy and the undertaking of socialist construction in Xinjiang.

    Long live the great motherland!
    Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups!

    中央代表董必武的讲话新疆各民族同胞们、同志们：
    新疆维吾尔自治区根据全国人民代表大会常务委员会的决定，并经过新疆省第一届人民代表大会第二次会议的讨论和通过，在中华人民共和国建国六周年国庆节的今天，庄严地宣布成立了。新疆维吾尔自治区的成立，是中国共产党的民族政策又一伟大的胜利，是祖国各民族人民在社会主义建设事业中的一件具有历史意义的大事，是国家按照宪法规定推行民族区域自治的一个重大成就，是新疆维吾尔族人民和各民族人民政治生活中的大事，我代表中国共产党中央委员会和中央人民政府向新疆维吾尔族人民和各民族人民致以热烈的祝贺。
    六年来，新疆在中国共产党、中央人民政府、毛泽东主席的正确领导下，在中共中央新疆分局、新疆省人民政府、人民解放军驻新疆部队和各民族人民的团结努力下，各项工作都有显著的成绩，各种建设事业都有迅速的发展，各民族人民的生活都得到了相当的改善和提高，成千上万的各民族的干部已经成长起来，在各种不同的工作岗位上，积极努力地执行并完成了祖国和人民所交给的任务，使新疆不仅在根本上改变了旧的民族关系，并且在各方面起了巨大的变化，改变了新疆的整个旧面貌。
    成立新疆维吾尔自治区，是新疆各民族人民共同的愿望，现在这个愿望实现了，新疆维吾尔自治区成立了。我们完全相信新疆各民族人民一定能够尽一切努力来巩固和建设自治区。爱护和建设新疆维吾尔自治区，首先是新疆各民族人民共同的责任，同时也是全国各民族人民大家的责任。
    新疆维吾尔自治区，是在我们伟大的祖国和各民族人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席的亲切关怀下建立的，是在祖国大家庭中各民族人民兄弟般的帮助下建立的。我们完全相信，新疆维吾尔自治区成立之后，新疆各民族人民一定能够继续获得祖国的关怀和支持，一定能够更进一步地加强祖国大家庭中各兄弟民族间的团结合作和互相帮助。日益走向繁荣富强的我们伟大的祖国，就是各民族人民幸福生活的最可靠的保证。
    新疆维吾尔自治区，是在新疆各民族人民团结互助、共同努力的基础上建立的，我们完全相信，新疆维吾尔自治区成立之后，新疆各民族人民一定能够更进一步地加强新疆各民族内部和新疆各民族之间的团结互助。各民族间的团结互助，各民族内部的团结互助，人口多的民族和人口少的民族的团结互助，经济、文化发展较先的民族和经济、文化发展较后的民族的团结互助，就是建设自治区和顺利地进行社会主义建设事业的最坚强的力量。
    我祝贺勤劳、勇敢的新疆各民族人民，在今后新疆实行区域自治和进行社会主义建设事业中获得更光辉的成就，获得更美满幸福的生活。
    伟大的祖国万岁！
    各民族大团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    各民族人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
