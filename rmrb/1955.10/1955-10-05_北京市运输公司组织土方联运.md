Beijing Transportation Company Organizes Joint Earthwork Transportation

Beijing Transportation Company organizes joint earthwork transportation, saving national expenditures.

The amount of ballast and earth needed for various basic construction projects in Beijing is very large, and the transportation capacity occupied is also significant. In the past, some units needed to transport earth outwards but could not find suitable disposal locations; however, some units needed earth but had no place to buy it. Even if they bought earth, it had to be transported from very far away, which not only increased transportation costs but also affected the timely supply of earth. In order to save transportation capacity and costs, and to reduce and eliminate unreasonable transportation, the transportation company, based on the distribution, flow, direction, start, and end points of earthwork transportation for each consigning unit, organized the units that needed earth and the units that needed to dispose of earth which were close to each other and suitable for transfer, to negotiate, inspect the soil quality, and agree on the proportion of transportation costs and transportation dates to be borne by both parties. For example, in February of this year, the Sanlihe construction site outside Xizhimen of the Ministry of Construction Engineering originally planned to buy 5,000 cubic meters of earth outside Deshengmen to lay the foundation, with a transportation distance of 15 li. After the Xizhimen business office of the transportation company took the initiative to contact them, they changed to using the earth that the Handicraft Administration construction site nearby needed to transport outwards. As a result, the transportation distance was shortened by 9 li, saving approximately 6,000 yuan in transportation costs and 2,000 yuan in earth purchasing costs.

Currently, Beijing Transportation Company is vigorously promoting this experience and has listed the organization of joint earthwork transportation as an important measure to practice thrift. According to incomplete statistics, more than 64,400 cubic meters of earthwork joint transportation were organized from July to mid-September. (Chen Yongzhong)

    北京市运输公司组织土方联运
    北京市运输公司组织土方联运，节省国家开支。
    北京市各基本建设工程需用碴土和土方的数量很大，占用的运力也很多。过去有的单位需要向外运土，找不到适当的消纳地点；但有的单位需要用土，却没有地方买，即使买到了土，也要从很远的地方运来，这不但加大了运费开支，而且影响用土的及时供应。为了节省运力、运费，减少和消灭不合理运输，运输公司根据各托运单位土方运输的分布情况、流量、流向以及起止地点，把距离较近，适合拨运的需土和出土单位组织起来，由双方商洽，验看土质，议定双方分担的运费比例和运输日期。如今年二月间，建筑工程部的西直门外三里河工地原计划在德胜门外买土五千方垫地基，运距十五华里，经运输公司西直门营业所主动联系，改用附近的手工业管理局工地需向外运的土方，结果缩短九华里的运距，节省了运费约六千元和购土费两千元。
    目前北京市运输公司正大力推广这一经验，并把组织土方联运列为厉行节约的重要措施之一。根据不完全统计，从七月到九月中就组织了土方联运六万四千四百多方。（陈用中）
