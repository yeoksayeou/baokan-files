Send Large Quantities of Production and Living Materials to Farmers

The peak season for rural markets has arrived. Commercial departments in various regions, especially the supply and marketing cooperative system, should immediately concentrate their main efforts on actively supplying production and living materials to approximately 500 million farmers. This is of vital importance for completing the state's annual agricultural product procurement plan, further improving and raising the living standards of the vast number of farmers, and promoting the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement.

This year, the country has experienced a bumper harvest, and rural purchasing power has generally increased. According to surveys in seven provinces, including Hebei, Hunan, and Guangdong, rural purchasing power has increased by as much as 33%. In areas affected by disasters last year, the purchasing power of many farmers has increased by one to two times. Most of this purchasing power will be invested in the market during the peak season this year. In the coming months, the task of supplying materials by commercial departments will be more arduous than in previous years.

This winter and next spring, the agricultural cooperation movement will see great development. In the past few years, farmers mostly purchased general production materials during the peak season. The increasing number of agricultural production cooperatives will need to purchase more new-style animal-powered farm tools, livestock, carts, and other production materials. At the same time, they will also need many building materials for necessary basic construction (warehouses, sheds, livestock feeding sheds, etc.). Some poor farmers and some young farmers who are about to get married and start families, as well as farmers in areas affected by floods last year, will need to repair or build houses, and supply and marketing cooperatives must also supply large quantities of basic construction materials.

After farmers sell agricultural and sideline products, they will not only purchase a certain amount of production materials, but also purchase various living materials; not only will they purchase many daily consumer goods, but also many cultural living items. The Hexiang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xinfan County, Sichuan, sold 34.5% more fabrics in the first half of this year than in the same period last year, and many farmers also reported that there were too few colors and varieties of fabrics. The sweat shirts, undershirts, soaps, rubber shoes, enamel basins, and flashlights sold by this supply and marketing cooperative in the first half of the year increased significantly compared to the same period last year, and some farmers also reported that there were too few goods. The steel pens and notebooks sold by this supply and marketing cooperative in the first half of the year increased by about two times compared to the same period last year, and the supply of various finished medicines also increased from five types to fifty-six types. If the situation was like this in the first half of the year, then, during the market peak season after the autumn harvest, farmers will certainly demand to buy more and better-quality living materials.

This is the new situation in the rural market this peak season. Many commercial department staff members have grasped this new situation, actively opened up sources of goods, and increased the variety of goods, which is very popular among farmers. However, some commercial department staff members have underestimated the new situation in the rural market and are not adequately prepared, resulting in temporary shortages of certain commodities in some areas. For example, basic-level cooperatives in twenty counties in Jiangsu Province experienced commodity shortages; Shanglin County in Guangxi experienced shortages of fifty-nine types of cotton cloth and fifty-eight types of general merchandise; individual areas experienced shortages of more than one hundred types of commodities. It is worth noting that many of the out-of-stock commodities are commodities that are in sufficient supply or have even been allocated to county-level stores, indicating that there are still some shortcomings in commodity allocation in some areas, which should be resolved quickly.

Some commercial department staff members cannot see the new situation of agricultural harvest, the great development of agricultural cooperation, and the implementation of the "three fixings" for grain. They subjectively believe that the disaster situation was serious last year, and that some farmers will have to repay loans this year, making them unable to purchase more production and living materials. Therefore, they are unwilling to actively expand sources of goods, fearing causing a backlog, resulting in shortages of certain commodities. There are also some commercial department staff members who lack sensitivity to new things, cannot see the changes in rural economic life, and one-sidedly believe that as long as there are "mass-market goods" they can meet the needs of farmers, resulting in some of the commodities they organize not being popular with farmers and being stockpiled, while some of the new varieties needed by farmers cannot be bought in supply and marketing cooperatives or even county stores.

After farmers sell agricultural products, they first need to purchase the production materials needed for winter plowing this year and expanded production next year. Therefore, the primary task of supply and marketing cooperatives is to do a good job in supplying production materials. Supply and marketing cooperatives should actively supply the production materials needed by the vast number of farmers (such as fertilizers, seeds, and small farm tools), and pay more attention to supplying new-style animal-powered farm tools and other large-scale production materials needed by agricultural production cooperatives. The staff of the supply and marketing cooperative system should recognize that if the supply of production materials is not timely, it will affect next year's agricultural output increase, affect farmers' enthusiasm for selling agricultural and sideline products, and may even cause rural purchasing power to impact certain living materials, affecting market and price stability. In addition, it is natural for the vast number of farmers after the harvest to demand to buy more and better living materials. The phenomenon of shortages of non-staple foods and small commodities in some rural markets before the peak season must attract great attention. State-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should continuously investigate and study what kind of industrial products farmers need, open up sources of goods according to the needs of farmers, strengthen the planning of commodity allocation, and overcome certain blind supply phenomena. The season for building houses has not yet arrived, but building materials in many rural markets have already begun to sell well. Supply and marketing cooperatives should pay attention to this trend and actively open up sources of bamboo, wood, bricks, tiles, lime, glass, wire nails, lead wire, and other goods. Most supply and marketing cooperatives did not have time to operate these commodities in the past, but now they should immediately investigate and estimate the types and quantities needed by farmers, and learn to operate these commodities.

Rural small merchants and peddlers are a huge force in supplying retail goods, especially living materials, to rural areas. Supply and marketing cooperatives should make full use of this force. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions pay great attention to carrying out retail business, which is necessary and has played a significant role in stabilizing market prices. However, nationwide, the wholesale plan for rural private merchants was not completed in the first half of the year, indicating that some supply and marketing cooperatives have not paid enough attention to arranging and transforming small merchants and peddlers. Facts have proved that abnormal phenomena will occur in the markets in areas where private merchants have not been properly arranged and transformed. In order to complete the commodity circulation task well, supply and marketing cooperatives must not only do a good job in their own retail business, but also be responsible for arranging and transforming rural private merchants. State-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives should currently combine the work of supplying materials during the peak season to strengthen the leadership of private merchants, on the one hand, give play to their active role, and at the same time, must prevent and stop their illegal acts, so as to fully realize the state's stipulated commodity circulation plan.

### 把大量生产资料和生活资料送到农民手里

    把大量生产资料和生活资料送到农民手里
    农村市场的旺季已经到来，各地商业部门，特别是供销合作社系统，应该立即集中主要力量，积极做好对五亿左右农民的生产资料和生活资料的供应工作。这对于完成国家的本年度农产品采购计划，进一步改善和提高广大农民生活，促进农业合作化运动的大发展，都有十分重要的作用。
    今年全国范围农业丰收，农村购买力普遍上升。根据河北、湖南、广东等七省的调查，农村购买力上升有高达百分之三十三的。去年受灾的地区，许多农民的购买力上升一倍到两倍。这些购买力的大部分要在今年旺季投入市场。在最近几个月中，商业部门的物资供应任务将比往年更加繁重。
    今冬明春农业合作化运动将有大发展。过去几年，农民在旺季多是购买一般的生产资料。日益增多的农业生产合作社就需要购买更多的新式畜力农具、牲畜、大车等生产资料，同时进行必要的基本建设（仓库、车棚、牲畜饲养棚等），也需要许多建筑材料。部分贫农和一些将要成家立业的青年农民、还有去年遭受水灾地区的农民，都需要修理或建筑房舍，供销合作社也必须供应大批基本建设材料。
    农民出售农业、副业产品以后，不仅要购买一定数量的生产资料，而且要购买各种各样的生活资料；不仅要购买许多日常消费用品，而且要购买许多文化生活用品。四川新繁县禾登乡供销合作社今年上半年销售的布匹比去年同期增加了百分之三十四点五，还有许多农民反映布匹的花色、品种太少。这个供销合作社上半年销售的汗衫、背心、香皂、胶鞋、磁盆、手电筒比去年同期增加很多，还有一些农民反映货色很少。这个供销合作社上半年销售的钢笔、笔记本比去年同期增加两倍左右，供应的各种成品药也由五种增加到五十六种。上半年情况是这样，那末，在秋收以后的市场旺季中，农民当然要求买到数量更多、质量更好的生活资料。
    这就是今年旺季农村市场的新情况。许多商业部门的工作人员掌握了这种新情况，积极开辟货源，增加货物品种，很受农民欢迎。但也有一些商业部门工作人员，对农村市场的新情况估计不足，准备不周，以致某些地区一度发生了若干商品脱销的现象。例如，江苏省有二十个县的基层社发生了商品脱销现象；广西上林县有五十九种棉布、五十八种百货脱销；个别地区脱销的商品达百种以上。值得注意的是，不少脱销的商品是货源充足甚至已经下放到县级商店的商品，说明某些地区在商品调拨上还存在着一些缺点，这是应该迅速加以解决的。
    有些商业部门工作人员看不见农业丰收，农业合作化大发展和实行粮食“三定”的新情况，主观地以为去年灾情严重，今年某些农民又要归还贷款，无力购买较多的生产资料和生活资料，所以不愿意积极扩大货源，害怕造成积压现象，以致某些商品就脱销了。也有一部分商业部门的工作人员，缺乏对新鲜事物的感受，看不见农村经济生活的变化，片面地认为只要有“大路货”就能满足农民的要求，以致他们组织的商品有一部分不受农民欢迎而被积压下来，而农民需要的一些新品种，在供销合作社甚至县商店中却买不到。
    农民出售农产品以后，首先要购买今年冬耕和明年扩大生产所需要的生产资料，因此，供销合作社的首要任务就是做好生产资料的供应工作。供销合作社要积极供应广大农民所需要的生产资料（如肥料、种籽、小农具等），更要注意供应农业生产合作社所需要的新式畜力农具和其他大型生产资料。供销合作社系统的工作人员应该认识，生产资料如果供应不及时，就会影响明年的农业增产，影响农民出售农业、副业产品的积极性，甚至会使农村购买力冲击某些生活资料，影响市场、物价的稳定。此外，丰收以后的广大农民要求购买更多更好的生活资料是很自然的。某些农村市场没到旺季就发生了副食品和小百货脱销的现象，这必须引起人们极大的注意。各地国营商业和供销合作社应该不断地调查研究农民需要一些什么样的工业品，根据农民的需要开辟货源，加强商品调拨的计划性，克服某些盲目供应现象。目前还没有到修建房屋的季节，许多农村市场上的建筑材料已开始畅销。供销合作社要注意这种趋势，积极开辟竹、木、砖、瓦、石灰、玻璃、洋钉、铅丝等货源。多数供销合作社过去没有来得及经营这些商品，现在应该立即调查、估算农民需要的品种和数量，学会经营这些商品。
    农村小商小贩是供应农村零售商品，特别是生活资料的巨大力量。供销合作社应该把这支力量充分运用起来。各地供销合作社很注意开展零售业务，这是必要的，对于稳定市场物价，起了显著的作用。但是，就全国范围来说，上半年对农村私商批发计划没有完成，这说明某些供销合作社还没有很好地注意安排和改造小商小贩。事实证明，哪些地区对私商没有进行妥善安排和改造，哪些地区的市场就会发生不正常的现象。供销合作社为了很好地完成商品流转任务，不仅要作好本身的零售业务，而且要负责安排和改造农村私商。国营商业和供销合作社目前应该结合旺季物资供应工作，加强对私商的领导，一面发挥他们的积极作用，同时必须预防和制止他们的不法行为，以完满地实现国家规定的商品流转计划。
