　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th: According to TASS, the UN General Assembly held a secret ballot on October 14 to elect three non-permanent members of the Security Council to replace Brazil, New Zealand, and Turkey, whose terms will expire on December 31.

　　Latin American countries nominated Cuba to replace Brazil. Australia is competing for the seat held by New Zealand. Eastern European countries nominated Poland to take the non-permanent seat that should belong to an Eastern European country according to agreement. However, for this seat, the US delegation violated the principle of fair regional distribution of Security Council seats stipulated in the UN Charter and the 1946 London Gentleman's Agreement, and nominated the Philippines as a candidate. Two years ago, the enemies of international cooperation tried to give this seat, which rightfully belonged to Eastern Europe, to Turkey. Now, they are trying to give this seat to the Philippines, which is thousands of miles away from Eastern Europe. But despite the pressure exerted by the United States on the delegations of several countries, especially Latin American countries, this American conspiracy failed to succeed at the meeting on the 14th.

　　In the first vote, Cuba received 53 votes and Australia received 41 votes, obtaining the necessary two-thirds majority to be elected as non-permanent members of the Security Council. Poland received 34 votes and the Philippines received 33 votes, neither obtaining the necessary majority.

　　In the next three votes, neither Poland nor the Philippines obtained the necessary majority. The pressure exerted by the United States on other delegations during the voting had the opposite effect, as the Philippines received two fewer votes in the fourth vote than in the third.

　　During the break after the fourth vote, the delegations of Eastern European countries decided to nominate Yugoslavia as a candidate to resolve the deadlock. But the United States and some other countries' delegations continued to insist on electing the Philippines. In the fifth vote, the Philippines received 30 votes and Yugoslavia received 25 votes. In the sixth vote, the Philippines received 29 votes and Yugoslavia received 28 votes. Thus, neither of them was able to be elected.

　　After the sixth vote, the British representative, Dixon, moved to postpone further voting until October 18. This motion was supported by the Soviet representative, Kuznetsov, and was passed by the General Assembly.

    联大全会投票选举安理会非常任理事国
    美国要使菲律宾强占东欧国家席位的阴谋受到挫折
    新华社十六日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：十月十四日联合国大会全体会议举行秘密投票，选举安全理事会三个非常任理事国，以接替将在十二月三十一日任期届满的巴西、新西兰和土耳其。
    拉丁美洲国家提名古巴接替巴西。澳大利亚竞选新西兰据有的席位。东欧国家提出由波兰担任按照协议应属东欧国家的一个非常任理事国。然而，对这一席位，美国代表团违反了联合国宪章中规定的安全理事会席位按地域公平分配的原则和一九四六年的伦敦君子协定，提出菲律宾为候选国。两年前，国际合作的敌人设法把这个理应属于东欧国家的席位给予了土耳其，现在，又在设法把这个席位给予离东欧有几千公里的菲律宾。但是，尽管美国对若干国家的代表团、首先是拉丁美洲国家代表团施加了压力，美国的这种阴谋在十四日会议上没有能够得逞。
    在第一次投票中古巴得五十三票，澳大利亚得四十一票，得到了必要的三分之二多数票，当选为安全理事会非常任理事国。波兰得三十四票，菲律宾得三十三票，都没有获得必要的多数。
    在接着的三次投票中，波兰和菲律宾都得不到必要的多数。美国在投票进行的时候对其他代表团施加的压力造成了反而不利的结果，因为在第四次投票中菲律宾所得的票数比第三次减少了两票。
    在第四次投票之后的休息时间内，东欧国家的代表团决定提出南斯拉夫为候选国，以解决僵局。但是美国和某些其他国家的代表团继续坚持要使菲律宾当选。在第五次投票中，菲律宾得三十票，南斯拉夫得二十五票，在第六次投票中，菲律宾得二十九票，南斯拉夫得二十八票。这样，它们都没有能当选。
    在第六次投票之后，英国代表逖克逊动议把进一步的投票推迟到十月十八日再举行。这项动议得到苏联代表库兹涅佐夫的支持，并且获得大会通过。
