    Xinhua News Agency, Margate, October 13th: A TASS correspondent reports from Margate: The British Labour Party's annual conference discussed proposals on foreign policy on the 12th. The conference passed a draft resolution proposed by Johnes, Chairman of the National Union of Mineworkers.
    The resolution stated: The conference, "viewing with extreme disquiet the appearance of the hydrogen bomb and other weapons of mass destruction, specifically calls upon the government to take the initiative again to organize great power negotiations to strive to ease international tensions and eliminate such weapons through universal disarmament implemented under effective international supervision."
    The resolution then emphasized that in order to resolve the Far East issue, it is necessary to allow the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations, while expelling Chiang Kai-shek and his main supporters from Taiwan, so that the residents of Taiwan may freely decide their own future.
    The resolution also called on "Arab countries and Israel to reach a settlement" and demanded that the British government "do everything possible to restore the unification of Germany under peaceful and free conditions through negotiations." The resolution stated: "The conference believes that the realization of these recommendations will be a significant contribution to the cause of easing international tensions and safeguarding international peace and cooperation."
    The conference also passed a proposal requesting the Labour Party to "recommend to the government the restoration of normal trade relations with China and all other countries."
    Noel-Baker, a representative from a Labour Party local organization, spoke in support of this proposal and was greeted with applause from the representatives. He said: Ordinary Labour Party members want to tell the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China that they hope to coexist peacefully and friendly with them, and develop cooperation with them.
    Emrys Hughes, a Labour Party Member of Parliament who had visited the Soviet Union, emphasized in his speech the Soviet Union's commitment to the cause of world peace.
    The annual conference passed without discussion a proposal protesting racial discrimination in the Union of South Africa, a proposal requesting the Labour Party National Executive Committee to pay attention to the issue of helping underdeveloped countries, and a proposal expressing support for the principles of the United Nations.

    通过要求恢复中国在联合国的地位等提案
    新华社十三日讯　据塔斯社马尔加特十三日讯：塔斯社特派记者报道：英国工党年会在十二日讨论关于外交政策的提案。年会通过了全国矿工联盟主席约翰斯提出的决议草案。
    决议说：会议“异常不安地注视着氢弹和其他大规模毁灭性武器的出现，特地呼吁政府再次采取主动，组织大国谈判，争取通过在有效的国际监督之下实行普遍裁军来缓和国际紧张局势和取消这类武器。”
    决议接着强调指出：为了解决远东问题，需要允许中华人民共和国进入联合国，同时把蒋介石和他的主要支持者驱逐出台湾。以使台湾居民有可能自由决定自己的前途问题。
    决议还号召“阿拉伯国家和以色列取得解决”，并且要求英国政府“尽一切可能通过谈判使德国在和平、自由的条件下恢复统一”。决议说：“会议认为，实现这些建议将是对和缓国际紧张局势和保障国际和平和合作的事业的重大贡献。”
    年会还通过一项提案，要求工党“向政府建议恢复同中国和所有其他国家的正常贸易关系”。
    工党地方组织的代表诺尔特·菲德发言支持这项提案，受到了代表们的鼓掌欢迎。他说：工党普通党员希望告诉苏联和中华人民共和国人民，他们希望同他们和平和友好地共处，同他们发展合作。
    曾经访问过苏联的工党议员埃姆里斯·休斯在发言中强调指出苏联致力于世界和平的事业。
