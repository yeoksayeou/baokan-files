Responding to the call made by Sun Shigui and five others at the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists' Congress to save coal, young conductors in the Harbin, Taiyuan, and other locomotive depots under the railway department are enthusiastically participating. By the beginning of October, more than fifty youth train crews in the Harbin Railway Bureau had already set coal-saving plans. The nationally renowned Zheng Xikun train crew of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot No. 105 proposed to guarantee saving 200 kilograms of coal per trip and achieve exceeding axle load. Conductors throughout the bureau have put forward a plan to save 10,000 tons of coal from now until the end of 1955. All young drivers in the Taiyuan North Station Locomotive Depot unanimously responded to the coal-saving initiative, proposing to guarantee a reduction of 12 kilograms in coal consumption per 10,000-ton kilometer in the fourth quarter, saving more than 500 tons of coal for the entire depot, and guaranteeing to exceed weight 1,276 times by the end of the year. The train crew of young driver Jiang Zuotang, who completed the annual transportation task on September 14th, plans to exceed weight by another 40 times and save 16 tons of coal in the fourth quarter. The youth of the 13th train crew of the Taiyuan South Station Locomotive Depot proposed to complete the annual plan two months ahead of schedule and implement the advanced experience of the "fast firing method," saving 51 tons of coal. The enthusiasm of young conductors at the Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot, where Sun Shigui works, to respond to the initiative is even higher. The youth train crews of ㄇㄎ一-type locomotives No. 1008 and No. 168 proposed to save 70 tons of coal in the fourth quarter, run 30 green light trains each, and guarantee to eliminate all accidents. All conductors at the Xifuxin Locomotive Depot, where Liu Jucai, one of the initiators and a youth activist, works, have also joined the upsurge of responding to the initiative. On September 29th, the team of young driver Wang Shixiu saved 763 kilograms of coal on a trip to Shenyang. When people asked him the reason for saving coal, he said, "Comrade Liu Jucai attended the conference, which is an honor for everyone. He spoke for us, so how can I not work harder to fulfill our promise!" Liu Jucai's partner, Comrade Zhou Jiucheng, also saved more than 500 kilograms of coal on a trip on National Day. Many conductors have proposed guarantees to the organization to respond to the initiative at party and Communist Youth League branch meetings. The leaders of the depot organized advanced experience promotion groups to help coal-consuming locomotives and coal-consuming conductors save coal. The entire depot is working hard to save 550 tons of coal in the fourth quarter. Tong Mingxi, the assistant driver of the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Depot, said, "Sun Shigui regards coal as black gold, but I regard it as the capital that the country should provide. He humbly learns from others and overcomes difficulties, while when I waste coal, I don't humbly check myself, but emphasize objective reasons. This time, I will definitely correct my mistakes, actively respond to the initiative, strive to save coal, and learn from the advanced."

    响应全国青年积极分子大会上的倡议
    各地铁路青年乘务员努力节省机车用煤
    铁道部门哈尔滨、太原等地机务段青年乘务员热烈响应孙士贵等六人在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上提出的节省煤炭的倡议。哈尔滨铁路管理局到十月上旬，已经有五十多个青年包车组订了省煤计划。全国闻名的苏家屯机务段一○五号郑锡坤包车组提出保证每趟车省煤二百公斤，并作到超轴。全局乘务员提出了从现在到一九五五年年底要节省一万吨煤的计划。太原北站机务段的全体青年司机一致响应省煤倡议，提出要在第四季度内保证每一万吨公里降低煤耗十二公斤，全段省煤五百多吨，并且保证到年底达到全年超重一千二百七十六次。在九月十四日就完成了全年运输任务的青年司机姜佐棠所在的包乘组，计划在第四季度内再超重四十次，并节约十六吨煤炭。太原南站机务段第十三包乘组的青年提出要提前两个月完成全年计划，并且实行“快速焚火法”的先进经验，节省煤炭五十一吨。孙士贵所在的工作单位——昂昂溪机务段的青年乘务员们，响应倡议的情绪更为高涨。冖ㄎ一型机车一○○八号和一六八号青年包车组提出在第四季度省煤七十吨，各开绿街列车三十列，并保证消灭一切事故。倡议人之一、青年积极分子刘巨才所在工作单位的西阜新机务段的全体乘务员们，也都卷入响应倡议的热潮。九月二十九日，青年司机王士秀班在开往沈阳的一趟车，就省了七百六十三公斤煤，当人们问他省煤原因时，他说：“刘巨才同志出席了大会，是大伙的光荣，他替我们说了话，我哪能不加把劲来实现我们的诺言呢！”刘巨才的伙伴周九诚同志，在国庆节那天，一趟车也省了五百多公斤煤。许多乘务员在党和团的支部大会上，纷纷向组织提出响应倡议的保证；段的领导干部，组织推广先进经验小组，帮助费煤机车和费煤的乘务员节省用煤量。全段正为第四季度省五百五十吨煤而努力着。张家口机务段副司机佟明溪说：“孙士贵把煤看成黑金，而我却看成是国家应该拿出的本钱；人家虚心向别人学习，克服困难，当我费煤时就不虚心检查，而是强调客观原因。这次我一定纠正错误，积极响应倡议，努力省煤，向先进者看齐。”
