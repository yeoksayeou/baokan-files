The participants held five-star red flags and various colored balloons. At the moment of the opening, colorful balloons and fireworks rose into the sky, and cheers rang out.

Also attending the opening ceremony were the head of the Soviet delegation to Tokyo, Domnitsky, and the chairman of the Central Council of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, Han Tok-su. Kang Mingqiu, representative of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and Zhang Jiajue, chairman of the board of directors of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association, were also present.

    After Ito Kesashi, chairman of the Japanese implementation committee of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition, announced the start of the opening ceremony, Cao Zhongshu, head of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation, delivered the opening speech. First, on behalf of the exhibition delegation, he expressed his gratitude to friends from all walks of life in Japan for their assistance and concern in various aspects. He said that the government and people of the People's Republic of China have always advocated developing economic and trade relations with all countries based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Cao Zhongshu then said: We believe that peace-loving people from all walks of life in Japan who are willing to develop peaceful economies with each other and promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese trade share the same desire as us, and hope that the exhibition will contribute to the realization of a new Sino-Japanese trade agreement. Cao Zhongshu pointed out that at the exhibition, people can see commodities that China has historically exported to Japan and that are needed by Japan, such as soybeans, coal, salt, iron sand, and other minerals, native products, animal products, food, etc. Due to the rapid development of China's industry and agriculture, the output and quality of these commodities have been continuously increased and improved, which can not only meet the needs of the domestic people, but also be exported to foreign countries. At the same time, everyone will also realize that China is carrying out large-scale economic construction and needs a lot of construction materials, and many industrial products from Japan are also needed by China. This shows that China and Japan have the material conditions for developing trade. Cao Zhongshu finally said that we sincerely hope that this exhibition will contribute to promoting the friendship between the people of China and Japan and developing Sino-Japanese trade relations.

    Next, Murata Shozo said in his speech: Thanks to the opening of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition, we have finally realized one of the important matters stipulated in the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement today. He emphasized: During this short preparation period, we have deepened our understanding of each other and enhanced our friendship through specific cooperation.

    Ikeda Masanosuke said in his speech: This Chinese Commodity Exhibition is of historical significance not only in the trade relations between China and Japan, but also in the friendly relations between the two countries.

    Takasaki Tatsunosuke said in his speech: “Our country has been greatly influenced by China in various aspects such as politics, economy, and culture since 1,500 years ago. The blood, flesh, and hearts of the Japanese people are connected to the Chinese people. It is regrettable that these two countries, which have deep historical and geographical ties, have not yet been able to shake hands. We hope to restore the old close relationship as soon as possible, which is the responsibility of the Japanese people.”

    Shinomiya Hisakichi said in his speech: "The Chinese Commodity Exhibition has brought great light to the future of Sino-Japanese trade, and I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations on this."

    Nomizo Masaru said in his speech: We have discussed with Mr. Nan Hanchen and Mr. Lei Renmin, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, on the obstacles to the implementation of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. These obstacles are undoubtedly on the Japanese side. We express our heartfelt thanks for the efforts of the Chinese people.

    Then, delegation leader Cao Zhongshu accepted written congratulatory messages from representatives and organizations from all walks of life in Japan. Among them, the congratulatory message from the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations stated: This commodity exhibition will undoubtedly further stimulate economic and cultural exchanges between Japan and China, and become an important step towards the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries. We are working hard to restore normal relations between Japan and China as soon as possible.

    The congratulatory message from the Japan-China Friendship Association stated: China has implemented the Five-Year Plan and is carrying out large-scale economic construction, and its foreign trade is expanding day by day. China and Japan are geographically adjacent and should conduct normal economic and cultural exchanges, but there are artificial obstacles at present. The Chinese Commodity Exhibition will help eliminate the current obstacles.

    Then, representatives of women from all walks of life in Japan presented flowers to Cao Zhongshu and others; at the same time, female members of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation and overseas Chinese women also presented flowers to representatives from all walks of life in Japan.

    Finally, Shinomiya Hisakichi, Chairman of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, cut the ribbon. Representatives from all walks of life in Japan and social celebrities, accompanied by Cao Zhongshu, Feng Tiecheng, Xiao Xiangqian, and other leaders of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation, visited the exhibition hall.

    Japanese guests and overseas Chinese unanimously believed that such a large-scale solo exhibition and grand opening ceremony were unprecedented in Japan. They unanimously expressed their praise and amazement at the great achievements of China's economic construction shown by the exhibits.

    On the evening of the opening of the exhibition, Chinese films were screened for the guests in the newly built cinema and were warmly welcomed by the guests.
