    Regarding the Maintenance Period of the Sanmenxia Reservoir

    Since Vice Premier Deng Zihui's "Report on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Curing the Yellow River's Water Calamities and Developing the Yellow River's Water Conservancy" was published, we have continuously received letters from readers asking about the service life of the Sanmenxia Reservoir. These readers said that the Sanmenxia Reservoir, which is about to be built, is one of the main projects in the first phase of the Yellow River transformation plan and an important part of our country's great socialist construction. It will serve the people for two to three hundred years or even more. However, why did Vice Premier Deng Zihui mention only "fifty to seventy years" when referring to the reservoir's maintenance period in his report?

    Now, we are publishing the Yellow River Planning Commission's response to this question as follows:

    Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report stated: "The Sanmenxia Reservoir can be maintained for at least fifty to seventy years or even longer." The number "fifty to seventy years" mentioned therein is estimated roughly according to the effects of the construction of the trunk and tributary reservoirs and the soil and water conservation work implemented in the first phase plan before 1967. In other words, this is the minimum maintenance period. In fact, after the implementation of the first phase of the plan, we will continue to harness the Yellow River, build more trunk and tributary reservoirs, and further develop soil and water conservation work. The reduction of the effects of sediment will definitely be more effective, and the Sanmenxia Reservoir will certainly be maintained for a longer time.

    In the initial stage, the reservoir will inevitably accumulate some silt, but this is precisely its task—only by blocking the sediment can the downstream river channel no longer be raised by silt, and can breaches and changes of course be avoided! Because the Sanmenxia Reservoir has a very large capacity, it can leave space for sediment to accumulate, and as the work of harnessing the Yellow River continues to develop, the amount of sediment accumulation will decrease year by year. The Sanmenxia Reservoir can still maintain a certain storage capacity to undertake various tasks such as flood control, irrigation, power generation, and navigation.

    When the long-term plan of the Yellow River comprehensive utilization plan is fully realized (Vice Premier Deng Zihui's report pointed out that this will take several decades), the face of the Yellow River will be greatly changed. The turbid Yellow River will become a clear water river, and the Sanmenxia Reservoir will not be afraid of sediment accumulation, and there is no need to worry about its maintenance period anymore.

    Of course, it is a very arduous task to do a good job in soil and water conservation and the construction of trunk and tributary reservoirs. This is not only because its workload is very large, but more importantly because it is a magnificent mass work. Such a great work of transforming nature is completely unimaginable and impossible to realize in capitalist countries. It can only be completed under our superior social system and under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. Therefore, this also requires the joint efforts of our millions of people!

### 关于三门峡水库的维持年限问题

    关于三门峡水库的维持年限问题
    在邓子恢副总理“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的报告”发表以后，我们不断接到读者来信，询问三门峡水库的使用年限问题。这些读者来信说，将要建设的三门峡水库，是改造黄河第一期计划中的主要工程之一，是我国伟大社会主义建设的一个重要组成部分。它将为人民服务二、三百年以至更多的年代。但是在邓子恢副总理的报告中提到这个水库的维持年限的时候，为什么只说是“五十年到七十年”呢？
    现在，我们把黄河规划委员会对这个问题的答复发表如下：
    邓子恢副总理的报告中是这样说的：“三门峡水库至少可以维持五十年到七十年或更长的时间。”其中所提到的“五十年到七十年”这个数字，是大体上按照一九六七年以前实施的第一期计划中修建的干支流水库和第一期水土保持工作的效果进行估计的。也就是说，这是最低限度的维持年限。事实上，在第一期计划实施以后，我们将继续治理黄河，修建更多的干支流水库，更进一步地开展水土保持工作，减少泥沙的作用一定会更加有效，三门峡水库也就一定能维持更长的时间。
    在初期，水库是不免要淤积一些的，但这正是它的任务——只有拦住泥沙，才能使下游河道不再淤高，而能避免决口改道！由于三门峡水库容积很大，可以留下位置让泥沙淤积，而且随着黄河治理工作的不断开展，泥沙淤积量会逐年减少，三门峡水库仍然可以维持一定的库容，来负担防洪、灌溉、发电、航运等各项任务。
    等到黄河综合利用规划的远景计划完全实现时（邓子恢副总理的报告中指出，这需要几十年时间），黄河的面貌将大为改变，浑浊的黄河变成了清水河，三门峡水库就不怕泥沙淤积了，也再不必耽心它的维持年限问题了。
    当然，要做好水土保持工作和干支流水库的修建工作，任务是很艰巨的。这不但因为它的工作量很大，更重要的是因为它是一个宏伟的群众性工作。这样伟大的改造自然的工作，在资本主义国家是完全不可想像和不可能实现的，只有在我们优越的社会制度下，在共产党和人民政府的领导下才能完成。因此，这也更需要我们千百万人民的共同努力！
