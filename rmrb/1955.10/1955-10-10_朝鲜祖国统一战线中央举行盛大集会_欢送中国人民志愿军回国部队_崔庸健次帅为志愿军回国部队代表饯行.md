Now, the Chinese People's Volunteers have decided to withdraw six more divisions after the previous two withdrawals of thirteen divisions, which is another concrete manifestation of this effort."

    Zhang Riqing also said: "We will never forget the warm care and full support given to us by the Korean people in the common struggle against aggression, as if we were their own children. The fighting friendship forged by the blood of the Chinese and Korean people will always inspire us to forge ahead courageously."
