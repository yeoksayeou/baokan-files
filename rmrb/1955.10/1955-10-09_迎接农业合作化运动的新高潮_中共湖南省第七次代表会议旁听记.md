    Ushering in a New Upsurge of the Agricultural Cooperativization Movement
    ——Notes from Attending the Seventh Congress of the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee
    Yin Wen, Shi Jun
    The Seventh Congress of the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee, held from August 20th to September 16th, focused on the issue of agricultural cooperativization. The meeting unanimously agreed that a new upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement was about to arrive; in some townships and districts, this upsurge had already begun, owing to the larger number and better performance of agricultural production cooperatives. To meet the demands of this situation, the meeting decided that this winter and next spring, the number of agricultural production cooperatives should increase to 75,000, including the existing 13,000-plus cooperatives, with cooperative members accounting for 20% of the total farming households; by the spring of 1957, the number should increase to 130,000, with cooperative members accounting for 40% of the total farming households; and by the winter of 1957, the number should increase to 150,000, with cooperative members accounting for 60% of the total farming households.
    The creation of this cooperativization plan involved a very enthusiastic and serious discussion. The representatives attending the meeting, based on the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, criticized the right-leaning ideology in the past agricultural cooperativization movement, and then unanimously adopted this plan.
    At the meeting, some people argued: "We are developing agricultural production cooperatives too quickly and in too great a number. Not only is the masses' awareness unable to keep up, but there are also not enough cadres to lead them." Many representatives immediately cited numerous examples to prove that this view was wrong. Hunan Province began experimenting with agricultural production cooperatives in 1952, with only 25 cooperatives at the time. By the spring of 1954, this number had grown to 430. From last winter to this spring, it further increased to 13,000. Over the past three years, the vast majority of cooperatives have increased production. In particular, this year, with the bumper harvests of early and mid-season rice, 80% to 90% of the cooperatives increased production by 10% to 30%, and the vast majority of cooperative members increased their income compared to before joining the cooperatives. Everyone knows that currently in rural areas, there are still 60% to 70% of poor and non-affluent peasants whose lives are still difficult or not yet prosperous. Therefore, when they see that the collective management of agricultural production cooperatives can solve production difficulties and increase production, many people actively request to join. Many middle peasants who were originally hesitant about the cooperativization movement are also requesting to join under the influence of the poor peasants. This year, around the early rice harvest of the Dongtingwei Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wangjia Township, Xiangyin County, farmers from nearby districts and townships visited and inspected the cooperative in an endless stream, sometimes as many as 60 to 70 people a day. After the visits, many people requested to join the cooperative. Furthermore, according to preliminary statistics from 20 townships in Xiangyin County, 161 mutual aid teams and 1,675 individual peasant households requested to join the cooperative. In Jili Township, Liuyang County, by mid-August, over 60% of poor and non-affluent peasants who had not yet joined the cooperative were actively requesting to join. The facts precisely prove that it is not that the masses' awareness cannot keep up, but that the leadership cannot keep up with the masses.
    Someone also said: "Now is the time to develop so many agricultural cooperatives, but the preparation work cannot keep up, and it is already too late." The representatives pointed out that preparation work is necessary for developing agricultural production cooperatives, but there are still six months from now until February or March of next year, and in such a long time, preparation work can still be done well. There are difficulties in the work, but the difficulties are not insurmountable. Moreover, some areas have already carried out the necessary preparation work. When the Party Central Committee's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperativization were issued, the counties in the Changde Special District convened cadre meetings to initially study the development plan, criticize the cadres' erroneous ideas, and simultaneously carry out large-scale publicity work on the Party's policies and methods on agricultural cooperativization. Soon after, the counties in the Special District held three-level cadre meetings to further study the development plan and improve the cadres' ideological understanding. The original plan for the entire Special District was to develop only 9,000 cooperatives this winter and next spring, but after discussion, this number was increased to 14,000. Those who use the excuse of not having done a good job in preparation and fail to actively develop agricultural production cooperatives are actually failing to see the strength of the masses and are being frightened by the current difficulties.
    In the face of this upsurge, does the Party have the ability to lead this movement? The answer from the meeting was completely affirmative. The meeting pointed out that we have had two or three years of experience in running cooperatives, and many county and district cadres have learned how to build and run cooperatives, and have accumulated a lot of experience. At the same time, the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee is currently taking many measures to strengthen the leadership in rural areas. For example, for a considerable period of time, the leading core members of counties and districts will generally not be changed, and a group of cadres (including some leading core members) will be transferred from provincial, prefectural, and municipal organs to strengthen the leadership in counties and districts. However, more importantly, we have the Party's grassroots organizations to rely on. Party branches have been established in over 85% of the townships in the province, and many Party branches have been fully tempered when they universally experimented with agricultural production cooperatives last winter and this spring. Among the more than 2,800 township Party branches in the Xiangtan Special District, more than 2,100 have experience in building and running cooperatives, accounting for 76% of the branches in the Special District; among the more than 5,200 cadres in the Party committees, governments, and mass organizations in the Special District, more than 4,200 have built or run cooperatives, an average of one or two cadres per township. Many representatives at the meeting also emphasized that although some cadres still have no experience or insufficient experience in building and running cooperatives, how do we acquire this experience? Obviously, we must let cadres and Party members in rural areas immerse themselves in practical struggles, temper themselves and improve themselves in practical struggles, and let them gain experience and lessons and increase their talents in the process of "doing."
    At the meeting, many representatives also examined their own right-leaning conservative ideas. The representatives from the Qianyang area believed that the main reason for the small-minded mistakes in the agricultural cooperativization movement was the lack of concrete analysis of the class nature of farmers of all strata and their different attitudes towards the socialist revolution. They only saw the wavering of a small number of affluent peasants towards the path of cooperativization, but did not see the enthusiasm of the vast majority of poor and non-affluent peasants; at the same time, they did not believe that the Party could lead the masses to run the cooperatives well, and therefore did not dare to boldly lead the movement, but were afraid of too much, too much chaos, and not running it well.
    In the discussion, some people were also concerned that the old cooperatives could not be consolidated. The facts show that the old cooperatives can be consolidated. In 1953, Changsha County had six cooperatives. From last winter to this spring, it developed to more than 600 cooperatives, an increase of more than a hundredfold. Now, the vast majority of the cooperatives have increased production and have been consolidated or can be consolidated. This spring, 11% of the cooperatives in Nanxian County were Type III cooperatives. During the spring plowing and production, the county party committee strengthened its leadership over the Type III cooperatives. By the early rice harvest, the Type III cooperatives, like all the cooperatives in the county, had increased production, and the number of Type III cooperatives had been reduced to 4%, and these 4% of the cooperatives could also be consolidated. These facts fully demonstrate that the masses are willing to run the cooperatives well and have the enthusiasm to consolidate them, and the Party has sufficient strength to consolidate the cooperatives. In some places, the work of consolidating the cooperatives is not done well enough, mainly because some cadres rarely consider the consolidation work of the cooperatives after they are built. At the same time, many cooperatives prematurely and excessively absorbed affluent and relatively affluent peasants into the cooperatives. These people often waver or exclude poor peasants, and even develop capitalism. Many cadres lack the necessary understanding of this and have not mobilized the members to carry out criticism and education; they even repeatedly try to retain those who resolutely demand to withdraw from the cooperative. These are all shortcomings in the work of consolidating the cooperatives. However, many representatives pointed out that with the leadership of the Party, the guidance of advanced cooperatives, and the support of the masses, these shortcomings can be overcome. Failing to see this, and therefore doubting that the old cooperatives cannot be consolidated, and showing hesitation and wavering about the great development of agricultural production cooperatives, is also a manifestation of a right-leaning ideology.
    The meeting also fully discussed how to complete the above-mentioned cooperativization plan. The meeting believed that in order to complete this plan as scheduled, Party organizations at all levels in the province must actively do the following series of preparation work: First, among the cadres, we must seek truth from facts to criticize erroneous ideas and summarize work experience. Second, among the masses of peasants, we must repeatedly publicize the Party's policies and methods on agricultural cooperativization, and pay special attention to using the achievements and experiences of the old cooperatives to carry out publicity. We should not only publicize the benefits of agricultural cooperativization, but also point out the difficulties that may be encountered in the process of agricultural cooperativization, so that peasants have sufficient mental preparation. Third, rectify and consolidate existing agricultural production cooperatives, so that existing cooperatives can become examples for guiding peasants forward. Fourth, according to the specific conditions of various places, adopt practical and feasible methods to do a good job in the construction planning for this winter and next spring, and the overall planning of the entire cooperativization movement. Fifth, according to the plan for the cooperatives that will be newly built, select and train cadres for running cooperatives, leading core members of cooperatives, and activists. Sixth, consolidate and expand the Party's rural organizations and effectively strengthen the Party's leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation committees of townships. Seventh, all aspects of work must actively support the agricultural cooperativization movement.

    迎接农业合作化运动的新高潮
    ——中共湖南省第七次代表会议旁听记
    印文　式军
    八月二十日至九月十六日的中共湖南省第七次代表会议上，曾着重讨论了农业合作化的问题。会议一致认为：一个新的农业合作化运动的高潮很快就要到来了；有些乡、区由于农业生产合作社办得较多较好，这一高潮已首先到来。为了适应这一形势的要求，会议决定：在今冬明春，要求连同原有的一万三千多个农业生产合作社在内发展到七万五千个农业生产合作社，入社农户占总农户的百分之二十；在一九五七年春，发展到十三万个农业生产合作社，入社农户占总农户的百分之四十；到一九五七年冬，发展到十五万个农业生产合作社，入社农户占总农户的百分之六十。
    这个合作化计划的产生，曾经过十分热烈和严肃的讨论。出席会议的代表们，根据党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，以批评和自我批评的精神，用自己亲身经历的经验教训，对过去的农业合作化运动中的右倾思想作了批判，然后一致通过了这个计划。
    会上，曾经有人认为：“我们现在这样发展农业生产合作社，太快太多，不仅群众的觉悟赶不上，而且也没有这么多干部去领导。”当即有不少代表举出许多事例来证明这种认识是错误的。湖南省在一九五二年开始试办农业生产合作社，当时只有二十五个社，到一九五四年春就发展到四百三十个。由去冬到今春又发展到一万三千个。三年来，绝大多数社都增了产，特别是今年，早、中稻丰收，百分之八、九十的社增产一成到三成，绝大部分社员都比入社前增加了收入。大家知道，目前农村中，还有着百分之六十到七十的贫农和非富裕农民，他们的生活还有困难，或者还不富裕。因此，当他们看到农业生产合作社集体经营能够解决生产困难增加生产时，许多人便积极要求入社。许多原来对合作化运动徘徊观望的中农，也在贫农的带动下要求入社。今年，在湘阴县王家乡洞庭围农业生产合作社早稻收割前后，附近区乡的农民络绎不绝地到这个社去参观、访问，有时一天竟多至六、七十人。参观后，许多人要求入社。又据湘阴县二十个乡的初步统计，有一百六十一个互助组和一千六百七十五户个体农民要求入社。在浏阳县集里乡，到八月中旬止，没有入社的贫农和非富裕农民，积极要求入社的在百分之六十以上。事实恰恰证明：不是群众的觉悟赶不上，而是领导赶不上群众。
    还曾有人说：“现在是应该发展这样多农业社，但是准备工作赶不上，现在已来不及了。”代表们指出：发展农业生产合作社是要做好准备工作的，但从现在起到明年二、三月止，还有半年来的时间，在这么长的时间里，还是可以作好准备工作。工作中有困难，但困难不是不可以克服的。何况有些地区已经进行了必要的准备工作。常德专区在党中央关于农业合作化问题的指示下达的时候，各县就分别召开了干部会议，初步研究了发展计划，批判了干部的错误思想，并同时开展了大张旗鼓的关于农业合作化的方针政策的宣传工作。不久，专区各县分别举行了三级干部会议，进一步研究了发展计划，提高干部思想认识。全专区原计划今冬明春只发展到九千个社，经过讨论，增加到了一万四千个。那种借口没有做好准备工作，而不去积极地发展农业生产合作社的人，实际上是看不到群众力量，而被目前的困难所吓倒。
    在这运动的高潮面前，党是不是有能力去领导这个运动呢？会议的答案是完全肯定的。会议指出：我们办社已经有两三年历史，不少县、区干部都学会了建社办社，积累了许多经验。同时，目前中共湖南省委正采取许多措施加强农村领导力量。如：在相当长的时期内，县区领导骨干一般不予变动，并从省、地、市机关中抽调一批干部（其中包括一部分领导骨干），加强县区领导力量。然而更重要的，是我们有着可以作为依靠的党的基层组织。全省百分之八十五以上的乡建立了党的支部，许多党支部在去冬今春普遍试办农业生产合作社时，就得到了充分的锻炼。湘潭专区全区二千八百多个乡的党支部中，具有建社办社经验的就有二千一百多个，占全区支部的百分之七十六；全区党委、政府和群众团体三个部门的干部五千二百多人中，建过社和办过社的就有四千二百多人，平均每乡都有一两个干部。到会的许多代表还着重指出：对于办社建社，固然还有一部分干部没有经验或者经验不足，但是究竟怎样去取得这种经验呢？很显然，我们必须让干部和农村中的党员，投入到实际斗争中去，在实际斗争中锻炼自己，提高自己，让他们在“做”的中间得到经验教训，增长才干。
    会上，许多代表还检查了自己的右倾保守思想。黔阳地区的代表认为：在农业合作化运动中，产生小手小脚的错误的主要原因是：对各阶层农民的阶级本质和他们在社会主义革命中不同的态度缺乏具体分析，只看到了小量富裕农民对于合作化道路的动摇性，而没有看到最大量的贫农和非富裕农民的积极性；同时，不相信党能领导群众办好社，因而对运动不敢大胆去领导，而怕多、怕乱、怕办不好。
    在讨论中，也还有人耽心老社不能够巩固，事实表明：老社是能够巩固的。长沙县在一九五三年有六个社，去冬今春发展到六百多个社，增加一百多倍，现在绝大部分社都增产了，都巩固下来或者可以巩固下来。今年春天，南县有百分之十一的三类型社。在春耕生产时县委加强了对三类型社的领导，到早稻收割时止，三类型社和全县所有的社一样，都增加了生产，三类型社减到百分之四，而这百分之四的社，也是可以巩固下来的。这些事实都充分说明，群众愿意把社办好，有巩固社的积极性，党也有足够的力量来巩固社。有些地方，巩固社的工作做得不够好，主要原因是有些干部在社建成后，很少考虑社的巩固工作。同时，不少的社过早过多地吸收了富裕的和比较富裕的农民入社，这些人经常动摇或者排斥贫农，甚至发展资本主义。许多干部对此缺乏必要的认识，未曾发动社员进行批评教育；对这些人之中的坚决要求退社者，还再三挽留。这些都是巩固社工作中的缺点。但是许多代表指出：有着党的领导，先进社的带动和群众的支持，这些缺点是可以克服的。看不到这一点，因而怀疑老社不能巩固，对农业生产合作社的大发展表现了犹豫和动摇，这也是一种右倾思想的表现。
    会议对于如何完成上述合作化计划亦作了充分的讨论。会议认为：为了如期完成这一计划，全省各级党组织必须积极做好以下一系列准备工作：一、在干部中，要实事求是地批判错误思想，总结工作经验。二、在农民群众中，要反复宣传党关于农业合作化的方针政策和办法，特别要注意利用老社的成绩和经验去进行宣传。不仅要宣传农业合作化的好处，也要指出农业合作化过程中可能碰到的困难，使农民有充分的精神准备。三、整顿巩固现有的农业生产合作社，使现有的社都能成为引导农民前进的榜样。四、根据各地的具体情况，采用切实可行的办法做好今冬明春的建社规划工作和整个合作化运动的全面规划工作。五、按照即将新建社的计划进行挑选、训练办社干部、社的领导骨干和积极分子。六、巩固和扩大党的农村组织，切实加强党对乡的互助合作委员会的领导。七、各个方面的工作必须积极支援农业合作化运动。
