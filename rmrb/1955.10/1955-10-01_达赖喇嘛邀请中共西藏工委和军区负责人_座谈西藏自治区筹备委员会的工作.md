    The Dalai Lama Invites CPC Tibet Work Committee and Military Region Leaders
    To Discuss the Work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region
    On September 26th, the Dalai Lama’s "Cho-yue" festival, the Dalai Lama invited Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Work Committee and Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region, Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Tibet Work Committee and Deputy Political Commissar of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region, and more than 130 leading cadres from all levels of the CPC Tibet Work Committee and the Tibet Military Region to a symposium at his summer residence, Norbulingka, to discuss the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region.
    At the symposium, the Dalai Lama first expressed his heartfelt respect to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and his gratitude to all personnel entering Tibet for the achievements made in various tasks since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. He said: The State Council's various decisions on work in Tibet are being implemented. Among them, the preparatory office for the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been established. In the future, we must work together to strengthen the unity of the Han and Tibetan fraternal nationalities so that the work of building a prosperous and happy new Tibet can be successfully completed.
    The Dalai Lama said that Chairman Mao had instructed us that Tibet currently needs the central government and advanced ethnic groups to provide assistance in various constructions, and after fifteen or twenty years, Tibet will be of great help to the construction of the motherland. Under the correct leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, we will work together to realize this instruction.
    He said: Tibet is located on a plateau, and working conditions are quite difficult. He hoped that Han cadres will continue to help the Tibetan people join the ranks of advanced fraternal nationalities with their unremitting hard work spirit. He hoped that Han cadres participating in the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will vigorously help Tibetan cadres, unite closely with each other, and do a good job together.
    Tan Guansan spoke at the symposium, calling on Han cadres to conscientiously implement ethnic policies, strengthen ethnic unity, humbly accept criticism from the Tibetan people, and consult with Tibetan officials and cadres well.
    After the symposium, a banquet was held. Renxi Danlun·Ceren Banjue, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Office of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and of the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee, and Banda Doji, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Office and Deputy Director of the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee, were invited to attend.
    Also invited to attend were Tibetan local government Kalon So-kang Wangqing Gelei, Dorga·Pengcuo Raojie, Assistant Kalon Xia Su·Jumo Ceren Doji, and Acting Kalon Gazhang·Luosang Renzeng.
    At the banquet, Acting Jicho Khenpo Losang Sandan delivered a speech on behalf of the Dalai Lama, expressing that everyone should work hard for the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Fan Ming, representing the Han cadres working in Tibet, said that they would wholeheartedly serve the Tibetan people in accordance with Chairman Mao's ethnic policy. (Xinhua News Agency)
