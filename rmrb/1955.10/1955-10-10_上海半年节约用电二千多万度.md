Shanghai Saves Over 20 Million Kilowatt-Hours of Electricity in Half a Year

    Shanghai has actively carried out work to rationally conserve electricity. In the first half of this year, the city has already saved more than 29 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.

    In order to scientifically grasp electricity consumption, Shanghai has initially compiled calculation methods for electricity consumption per unit product for more than 20 industrial sectors this year. Other more complex industrial sectors have also strengthened electricity consumption statistics work in order to gradually grasp the laws of electricity consumption. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shanghai Electric Power Administration assisted various industrial supervisory units, held short-term electricity distribution training classes, sorted out and exchanged methods for conserving electricity in various industrial sectors, and introduced the experiences of some factories in "electricity consumption targets down to the workshop" and "electricity consumption quota management". Industrial sectors that were previously considered difficult to save electricity (such as cold storage plants, etc.) also combined with improvements in production to explore ways to save electricity.

    It is estimated that the amount of electricity saved in Shanghai this year can exceed 60 million kilowatt-hours.

    上海半年节约用电二千多万度
    上海市积极开展合理节约用电工作，今年上半年全市已节约电力二千九百多万度。
    为了科学地掌握电力消耗，上海今年初步编制了二十多种工业部门单位产品耗电量计算办法。其他较复杂的工业部门也加强了用电统计工作，以便逐步掌握电力消耗的规律。上海电业管理局在中共上海市委的领导下，协助各工业主管单位，举办了短期的电力分配讲习班，整理和交流了各工业部门节约用电的办法，介绍了一些工厂的“用电指标下车间”、“用电定额管理”的经验。过去认为不容易节约用电的工业部门（如冷藏厂等）也都结合生产上的改进，挖掘了节约用电的办法。
    今年上海节约用电的数量，预计可以超过六千万度。
