Xinhua News Agency, October 26th. Following the conclusion of the National Conference on Writing Reform, the Ministry of Education immediately convened a symposium with representatives of primary and secondary school teachers and teachers from all levels of normal schools, as well as educational administrative cadres, who had participated in the conference.

The symposium, based on the resolutions of the National Conference on Writing Reform, studied the principles for promoting Mandarin Chinese and the steps and requirements for using Mandarin Chinese in teaching in schools. It also discussed important issues such as training teachers and editing Mandarin Chinese teaching materials. The Ministry of Education will incorporate the opinions put forward at the symposium to formulate specific instructions, which will be submitted to the State Council for approval and then promulgated.

Participants in the symposium said in their speeches that primary and secondary schools and normal schools at all levels should be the focus of promoting Mandarin Chinese; the Chinese language course should first use Mandarin Chinese for teaching, and then it should be extended to other courses, so that students can gradually learn Mandarin Chinese. In the process of promoting Mandarin Chinese, appropriate implementation steps and requirements should be determined according to the specific conditions of different regions, schools, and teachers. Speakers at the symposium requested that all Chinese language teachers in normal schools and first-grade teachers in junior high schools and primary schools nationwide be fully trained before the summer vacation of 1956. They also said that teacher training classes in Mandarin Chinese held by provinces (municipalities) and counties (cities) should have different requirements; teachers graduating from provincial (municipal) training classes should serve as lecturers in teacher training classes in Mandarin Chinese in various counties (cities). They also proposed that teachers can be trained through self-study and by organizing teachers who can speak Mandarin Chinese to teach teachers who cannot speak Mandarin Chinese in their spare time. They requested that higher normal schools, in coordination with educational administrative departments, undertake the work of editing Mandarin Chinese teaching materials, training Mandarin Chinese teachers, and investigating dialects. They also requested that relevant units such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central People's Broadcasting Station, and the People's Education Press edit, publish, and supply standard pronunciation vocabulary, Mandarin Chinese charts, books introducing experience, and teaching phonetic recordings.

Dong Chun-cai, Vice Minister of Education, made a concluding speech at the symposium. He called for vigorously promoting the teaching of Mandarin Chinese in primary and secondary schools and normal schools at all levels. Primary and secondary schools, as well as normal schools, spare-time cultural schools for workers and peasants, and cultural refresher schools for cadres should actively adopt simplified characters. He pointed out that educational administrative departments in various regions should formulate specific plans for promoting Mandarin Chinese in schools, and should pay special attention to vigorously training teachers; places that have already run training classes should promptly summarize their experiences. He also said that the Ministry of Education has decided to use simplified characters in official correspondence between educational administrative departments, and to promote horizontal writing and horizontal typesetting; the "Beijing Phonetics Teaching Research Class" is being actively prepared.

The symposium lasted for two days and ended on the 26th.
