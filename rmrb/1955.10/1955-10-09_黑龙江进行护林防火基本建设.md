Heilongjiang is establishing 87 forest management stations in the important forest areas of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains and the Wanda Mountains in the second half of this year. These stations will be equipped with sufficient forest protection and afforestation personnel to strengthen forest management. During the fire season, they will conduct regular patrols and inspections within the forests to prevent forest fires and, if a fire occurs, become the main force for fighting it. During peacetime, they can, in accordance with the national forest management plan, divide forest classes, build forest roads, clear forest areas, and carry out nurturing and renewal work. In addition, 760 kilometers of simple forest roads and 1,200 kilometers of fire prevention telephone lines will be built, and appropriate vehicles and horses will be equipped to facilitate communication and patrol work. An airport will be built in the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area to strengthen aerial patrols, and two chemical fire extinguishing stations will be established in Huma and Yichun to further engage in chemical fire extinguishing work.

The above-mentioned construction can change the state of unattended management of tens of millions of hectares of important forests in the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, and more effectively protect the safety of forest resources. At the same time, it can gradually realize the management of forests using scientific methods, so that the trees can be continuously supplied to meet the needs of national socialist construction.

    黑龙江进行护林防火基本建设
    黑龙江省今年下半年将在大、小兴安岭和完达山脉的重要林区建立森林经营所八十七处，配备足够的护林营林人员，加强森林经营管理工作。在防火期间，他们经常进行林内巡逻检查，防止森林火灾发生，发现火后则成为救火主力；平时可按照国家规定的林区施业方案，进行划分林班，修建林道，清理林场和抚育更新工作。另外还修建简易林区公路七百六十公里、防火电话线路一千二百公里，并适当配备汽车、马匹便于通讯和巡查工作。在小兴安岭林区内修飞机场一处，加强飞机巡护，在呼玛、伊春建立两处化学灭火站，进一步从事化学灭火工作。
    上述建设可以改变大、小兴安岭上千万公顷的重要森林无人管理的状态，更有效的保护森林资源的安全。同时可逐步实现用科学方法经营森林，使林木源源不断地供给国家社会主义建设的需要。
