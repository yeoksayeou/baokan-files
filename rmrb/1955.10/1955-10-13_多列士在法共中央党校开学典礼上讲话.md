Xinhua News Agency, Paris, as reported by TASS: French Communist Party General Secretary Maurice Thorez spoke on the 10th at the opening ceremony of the French Communist Party Central School.

    Speaking about the current international situation, Thorez said that the capitalist camp is full of internal contradictions, while the socialist camp is increasingly consolidated and growing stronger. Following the example of the Soviet Union, the cause of socialist construction is being carried out victoriously on the territory from the Elbe River to the China Sea. Throughout the world, life is confirming the correctness of Marxist-Leninist doctrine.

    Thorez then spoke about the political situation in France. He pointed out that after the liberation of the country, the Communist Party, together with other parties and groups, proposed the establishment of the French Federation, believing that relations between the French people and the people of overseas territories could be established on a new basis within this federation. Thorez continued, saying that since then, the representatives of the French bourgeoisie have done everything possible to destroy this hope. In Vietnam, the colonialists have used every means, even launching a terrible war, in an attempt to rebuild the abhorrent system that has been sanctioned by history. "In South Vietnam, the only result of the policies of French imperialists has been to allow their masters and rivals—American colonialists—to enter there. Even as the Saigon puppet government and the Cambodian government openly express their opposition to the French Federation, the democratic government led by President Ho Chi Minh has announced that it is ready to reach a reconciliation with France."

    Thorez said: Now one cannot help but ask, is it necessary to implement in North Africa the war policy that has already been implemented in Indochina? The only way to solve the problems of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia is to negotiate with the representatives who have the right to represent the people of these countries. Only this way is it possible to unite within the French Federation those people who are enslaved by French imperialists and who, now with the support of French workers and other democrats, are demanding freedom and national independence. The people of all countries in the French Federation, including the Algerian people, should become masters of their own destiny. This is the unwavering position of our party, and our party believes that true patriotism is inseparable from proletarian internationalism.

    Thorez finally pointed out the great significance of the French Communist Party's struggle to establish a united workers' class front.

    多列士在法共中央党校开学典礼上讲话
    新华社十二日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党总书记多列士十日在法国共产党中央党校的开学典礼上讲话。
    多列士在谈到目前的国际局势时说，资本主义阵营充满内部矛盾，而社会主义阵营则日益巩固和壮大。效法着苏联的榜样，社会主义建设事业正在从易北河到中国海的领土上胜利地进行着。在全世界，生活都在证实马克思—列宁主义学说的正确性。
    多列士接着谈到法国的政治局势。他指出，在国家解放后，共产党同其他党派团体一道建议建立法兰西联邦，认为在这个联邦中可以在新的基础上建立法国人民和海外领土人民之间的关系。多列士接着说，从那时起，法国的资产阶级代表尽一切办法来摧毁这种希望。在越南，殖民主义者使用一切办法，甚至竟发动可怕的战争，企图在越南重建起受到历史制裁的可憎制度。“在越南南部，法国帝国主义者的政策的唯一结果就是让他们的主人和对手——美国殖民主义者打进那里。就是在目前西贡傀儡政府和柬埔寨政府公开表示反对法兰西联邦的时候，胡志明主席领导的民主政府宣布，准备同法国取得和解”。
    多列士说：现在不禁要问，是否也要在北非实行在印度支那已经实行过的战争政策呢？解决摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚和突尼斯问题的唯一办法就是同有权代表这些国家的人民的代表进行谈判。只有这个办法才可能把那些受法国帝国主义者奴役的、现在在法国工人和其他民主人士支持下要求自由和民族独立的人民在法兰西联邦之内团结起来。法兰西联邦的各国人民，包括阿尔及利亚人民在内，应该成为自己命运的主人。这就是我们党的不可动摇的立场，我们党认为，真正的爱国主义是同无产阶级国际主义不可分割的。
    多列士最后指出法国共产党人为建立一个统一的工人阶级阵线而奋斗的重大意义。
