Xinhua News Agency, October 24th:

    The people of Taiwan, under the increasingly intensified special agent terrorist rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, are increasingly filled with hatred for the Chiang bandits and yearn for liberation.

    According to Taiwan newspapers, Chiang Kai-shek's special agent organs are ubiquitous in Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek Taiwan Provincial Police Department alone has established more than 5,000 so-called "police service zones" in the 21 counties and cities of Taiwan. Approximately 30,000 Chiang Kai-shek police officers are carrying out more than 90 kinds of "services" that exploit the Taiwanese people, such as urging donations and taxes, forcibly demolishing houses, conducting surprise inspections, arresting people, and escorting young people into the military to serve as cannon fodder. These Chiang Kai-shek police officers run rampant and commit all kinds of evils throughout Taiwan. Not long ago, the Nanrong Road Police Station of the Chiang Kai-shek Keelung City Police Bureau arrested a young man named Sun Pingxiong for the "crime" of "talking and laughing loudly with his girlfriend late at night," and subjected him to torture, causing Sun Pingxiong to suffer serious injuries. Zhan Shibao, a resident of Changhua County, reported the theft of his bicycle to the local Chiang Kai-shek police bureau, but was falsely accused of "falsely reporting the theft," subjected to beatings, waterboarding, and other tortures, and imprisoned. Chiang Kai-shek's police also often take advantage of their power to rape women. Recently, personnel from the Security Team of the Chiang Kai-shek Changhua County Police Bureau committed a crime of holding a gun and raping a woman, and extorting the victim's husband.

    Under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's special agent police, thousands upon thousands of Taiwanese people have been arrested and killed. According to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's "Yearbook," from 1949 to 1953, more than 116,000 people were detained in various prisons and detention centers in Taiwan. This figure does not include the number of people imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps established by Chiang Kai-shek's secret police agencies. Many of the more than 100,000 people who were thrown into prison or even killed by Chiang Kai-shek were accused of violating Chiang Kai-shek's "Regulations for the Punishment of Rebellion," "Regulations for the Suppression of Communist Spies during the Period of Rebellion," "Military Secrets Protection Law," "Regulations on Obstructing Military Service," "Oath Regulations," and other numerous "laws" that persecuted the Taiwanese people. In recent years, Chiang Kai-shek's special agent police agencies have been conducting large-scale arrests more frantically throughout Taiwan. Each time a "surprise inspection" or "general household registration check" is conducted in various counties and cities, thousands of people are arrested. Chiang Kai-shek's "Central Daily News" also admits that Taiwan's "prisons are overcrowded." From January to August of this year alone, more than 10,000 people were arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's Taiwan Provincial Criminal Police Brigade.

    These bloody crimes committed by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in suppressing the people of Taiwan are supported by U.S. imperialism. In recent years, Chiang Kai-shek has continuously dispatched police special agents to the United States to learn so-called "police business" to harm the people; the United States has aided Chiang Kai-shek in establishing a "Criminal Experimental Building" to experiment with various new types of torture to harm the Taiwanese people. According to a Chiang Kai-shek "Central News Agency" New York dispatch, recently Le Gan, the "Principal of the Central Police Academy" of Chiang Kai-shek, went to the United States again to discuss the matter of the United States "training more police officers" for Chiang Kai-shek. The report said that Le Gan also represented Chiang Kai-shek's police personnel in "expressing gratitude" for the "extensive assistance" given by the U.S. government, especially the U.S. police personnel.

    Chiang Kai-shek's bloody rule has strengthened the Taiwanese people's will to resist and their patriotism. In Taipei City, when a large number of Chiang Kai-shek police officers forcibly demolished houses in the name of "cracking down on illegal construction," they were recently resisted by residents in Shulan Street, Xinyi Road, Zhonghua Road, and Andong Street. Incidents of Taiwanese people smashing Chiang Kai-shek's police stations have also occurred. The Taiwanese people's desire for liberation is becoming increasingly urgent. G.K. Reddy, a reporter for the "Indian Times," wrote in "A Trip to Taiwan": The people of Taiwan all "crave news from the mainland." Reddy wrote: In Taiwan, "everyone can discover a kind of pride in the hearts of the Taiwanese people," that is, the motherland "has become a powerful country."

    台湾人民痛恨蒋贼恐怖统治渴望早日解放
    新华社二十四日讯　在蒋介石卖国集团变本加厉的特务恐怖统治下的台湾人民，对蒋贼的仇恨日益加深，渴望解放。
    据台湾报刊透露，台湾蒋贼特务机关林立，其中单是蒋贼台湾省警务处，就在台湾二十一个县市设立了五千多个所谓“警勤区”，由约三万名蒋贼警察执行催捐征税、强拆民房、突击大检查、拘捕人民、押解青年入营当炮灰等九十多种压榨台湾人民的“勤务”。这些蒋贼警察在台湾各地横行霸道，无恶不作。不久前，蒋贼基隆市警察局南荣路派出所竟以“与女友深夜高声谈笑”为“罪名”，逮捕了青年孙平雄，并施用酷刑使孙平雄身受重伤。彰化县居民詹石拔因自行车失窃向当地蒋贼警察局报案，竟被硬指为“谎报失窃”，施以捶打、灌水等酷刑并押进牢中。蒋贼警察还常常仗势强奸民女。最近就发生了蒋贼彰化县警察局保安队人员持枪强奸妇女，并向受害者的丈夫敲诈勒索的事件。
    在蒋贼特务警察统治下，成千上万的台湾人民被逮捕和杀害。据蒋介石卖国集团的“年鉴”透露，从一九四九年到一九五三年，曾被拘押在台湾各监狱和看守所的人，共有十一万六千多名。这个数字还没有包括蒋贼秘密警察机关设立的牢狱和集中营囚禁的人数在内。这十多万被蒋贼投进牢狱甚至加以杀害的人，许多都被指为触犯蒋贼的“惩治叛乱条例”、“戡乱时期检肃匪谍条例”、“军机防护法”、“妨害兵役条例”、“宣誓条例”等多如牛毛的迫害台湾人民的“法令”。近年来，蒋贼特务警察机关在台湾各地更加疯狂地进行大逮捕，各县市每次举行“突击大检查”或“户口总清查”等时，被捕者数以千计。蒋贼“中央日报”也承认台湾“监狱人满为患”。在今年一月到八月，单被蒋贼台湾省刑警总队逮捕的就有一万人以上。
    蒋介石卖国集团这些镇压台湾人民的血腥罪行，是受到美帝国主义的支持的。几年来蒋贼不断派遣警察特务到美国学习残害人民的所谓“警察业务”；美国援助蒋贼建立了“刑事实验大楼”，以实验各种新式的杀人酷刑来残害台湾人民。据蒋贼“中央社”纽约消息，最近蒋贼“中央警官学校校长”乐干又到美国去对由美国替蒋贼“训练较多的警务官员”一事进行洽商。消息说，乐干还代表蒋贼警察人员，对美国政府特别是美国警务人员给予的“广大协助”，“表示感谢”。
    蒋贼的血腥统治增强了台湾人民的反抗意志和爱国心。在台北市，大队蒋贼警察以“取缔违章建筑”为名强拆民房时，最近先后在舒兰街、信义路、中华路、安东街等地遭到赤手空拳的居民的反抗。台湾人民捣毁蒋贼警察所的事件也曾发生。台湾人民渴望解放的心情日益迫切。“印度时报”记者格·克·雷迪在“台湾之行”中写道：台湾人民人人都“渴望着大陆来的消息”。雷迪写道：在台湾，“人人都可以发现台湾人民内心的一种骄傲”，就是祖国“已经变成了一个强大的国家”。
