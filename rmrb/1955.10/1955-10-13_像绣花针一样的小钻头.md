Small Drills Like Embroidery Needles
Li Feng
The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant has produced precision 0.25 mm small drills.

The 0.25 mm small drill is a tool for manufacturing precision instruments, and manufacturing main parts of automobile, airplane, tractor and diesel engines. Without the 0.25 mm small drill, it would not be possible to drill many small holes in the fuel injection pipes of engines; without these small holes, the liquid fuel could not become atomized when entering the cylinder. Therefore, although this kind of drill is small, its impact on the development of China's machinery industry is not small.

This kind of small drill is as thin as an embroidery needle, and it is not easy to find if it falls on the ground. The workers were stunned when they first saw the blueprints and operating procedures. Because most of the workers here are lathe operators, they used to be used to the working methods of large-scale work, and they would use high-speed cutting at every turn. When they started the lathe, it would always be thousands of revolutions, and iron filings would fly straight out. Now, to produce such precision products, the lathe can only turn dozens of revolutions, and the product cannot have an error of even a few tenths of a millimeter, because the entire product is only 0.25 mm in size!

Heat treatment is the first key process in processing small drills. At first, the workers used the method of heating large drills to heat small drills, and 80% of the drills that came out of the first furnace were bent. Ren Zhongyi, the leader of the drill team, was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot. In order to find out the reason, he risked the high temperature of the furnace, dripping with beads of sweat, observing the changes in the furnace, and watched three or four furnaces. Finally, he found that such small drills could not be heated in the same way as large drills. He immediately turned off the power, calmed the boiling chemical liquid, and the drills that came out were indeed less bent. Later, according to this principle, the workers in the drill team also adopted preheating and cooling with warm oil, which increased the yield rate from 20% to 99.5%.

Grinder Li Xianju was the first to start processing. He had just sat on the "fitter's stool," and before the lathe could even run, the material he put on was nowhere to be found. The second time, although it was not lost, because his hand was a little heavy, he actually ground a straight material into an arc. After many tests, it was finally possible to master the weight of the movement, but when grinding the tip, it was always difficult to see clearly when the work was on the lathe, and it was not easy to feel it with his hand, so it was either ground too large, or ground too small, or it was chipped off. After working for a month, he did not produce a single finished product. Later, with the help of Soviet experts Comrades Qiu Wanov and Zakharov, after everyone's painstaking research, the technical problems were solved, and according to the suggestions of the Soviet experts, a 120x microscope was installed on the lathe, which enabled the product to meet the technical standards.

    像绣花针一样的小钻头
    李风
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂已经生产精密的○·二五公厘小钻头了。
    ○·二五公厘小钻头是制造精密仪器，制造汽车、飞机、拖拉机的发动机和柴油发动机的主要零件的工具。没有○·二五公厘小钻头，就不能在发动机的喷油管上钻许多小孔；没有这些小孔，液体燃料进入汽缸时就不能成为雾状。所以，这种钻头虽小，但对我国机械工业发展的影响可不小。
    这种小钻头细得像绣花针似的，掉在地上很不易找到。工人们第一次看到图纸和操作规程时都愣住了。因为这里的工人大都是车工出身，过去习惯了大拉大扯的工作方法，动不动就是高速切削，一开车总是不下千八百转，铁沫子直飞。现在要生产这样精密的产品，床子只能打几十转，产品就是误差零点几公厘也不行，因为整个产品才只有○点二五公厘那么大啊！
    热处理是加工小钻头的第一个关键工序。工人们起初用加热大钻头的办法来加热小钻头，第一炉出来的钻头有百分之八十都弯了。钻头组组长任忠义急得像热锅上的蚂蚁一样，为了找清原因，冒着炉子的高温，流着豆粒大的汗珠子，察看炉子变化情况，一直看了三、四炉。最后，他发现这样小的钻头不能同大钻头一样加热。他马上关上了电门，使沸腾的化学液平静下来，沾出的钻头果然弯的少了。后来，钻头小组的工人根据这个道理，又采取了预热和用温油冷却的办法，使成品率由百分之二十提高到百分之九十九点五。
    磨工李献巨第一个开始加工。他刚刚坐上“钳工凳”，还没等车跑起来，上的料就不知去向了；第二次虽然没丢，可是因为手稍重了一些，竟把一根笔直的料磨成了弧形，经过多次试验，好容易才能掌握动作的轻重了，可是在磨尖时，活上到床子上，总看不清楚，用手摸也不容易感觉出来，所以不是磨大了，就是磨小了，再不就是蹦掉了。干了一个月，没出过一件成品。后来在苏联专家邱万诺夫和查哈洛夫同志的帮助下，经过大家苦心钻研，解决了技术上的问题，并且根据苏联专家的建议，在床子上安上了一架一百二十倍的显微镜，才使产品达到了技术标准。
