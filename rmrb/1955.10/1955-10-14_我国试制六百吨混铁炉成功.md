China Successfully Trials 600-ton Mixer Furnace

China's first domestically produced 600-ton mixer furnace has been successfully trialed by the Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Factory.

The 600-ton mixer furnace is an indispensable and important piece of equipment for the metallurgical industry. Its function is to store molten iron from blast furnaces, adjust the composition of the molten iron, and maintain the high temperature of the molten iron with gas. This can greatly shorten steelmaking time and increase steel production. Its entire parts consist of more than 10,000 pieces, and the main components are welded together with 82 mm thick steel plates. Welding such thick steel plates is a first for China. Under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, the workers of the Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Factory solved many major technical problems, mastered the advanced technology of welding thick steel plates and processing large parts weighing more than ten tons, and produced this new product in nine months.

The development of China's metallurgical industry requires many mixer furnaces. This 600-ton mixer furnace will soon be transported to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company to be put into production. Now, the workers of the Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Factory are confidently starting to produce the second 600-ton mixer furnace.

    我国试制六百吨混铁炉成功
    我国自制的第一台六百吨混铁炉已由大连工矿车辆厂试制成功。
    六百吨混铁炉是冶金工业不可缺少的重要设备。它的作用是容贮高炉化好的铁水，调和铁水的成分，并用瓦斯保持铁水的高温，因而可以大大缩短炼钢时间，提高钢的产量。它的全部零件有一万多件，主要部件都是用八十二公厘的厚钢板焊接起来的。焊接这么厚的钢板在我国还是第一次。大连工矿车辆厂职工在苏联专家的热情指导下，解决了许多重大的技术问题，掌握了焊接厚钢板和加工十多吨重的大部件的先进技术，在九个月中把这一新产品制成。
    我国冶金工业的发展需要很多的混铁炉。这台六百吨混铁炉，即将运往鞍山钢铁公司投入生产。现在，大连工矿车辆厂职工正满怀信心地开始生产第二台六百吨混铁炉了。
