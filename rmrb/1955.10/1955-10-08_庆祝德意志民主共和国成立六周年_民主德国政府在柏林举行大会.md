Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 7th. The government of the German Democratic Republic held a celebration conference for the sixth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic in the German State Opera in Berlin on the evening of the 6th.

The President of the German Democratic Republic, Pieck, Prime Minister Grotewohl, First Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany Ulbricht, First Deputy Chairman of the People's Chamber Matern, Deputy Prime Ministers Stoph, Bolz, Nuschke, Schulz, Loch, and ministers of various ministries, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party Reimann, Chairman of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany Correns, former German Chancellor Wirth, and others attended the conference.

The attendees warmly welcomed the Soviet government delegation headed by Suslov, member of the Presidium and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the representative of the People's Republic of China, Zeng Yongquan, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the German Democratic Republic, as well as government delegations from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Mongolia, and representatives from fraternal communist and workers' parties from France, Italy, Austria, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and many other European countries.

Prime Minister Grotewohl spoke at the conference and the attendees responded with stormy applause.

Grotewohl first pointed out: The years since the founding of the German Democratic Republic have been years of serious and arduous labor. He said that all our work in the past few years has been largely related to domestic and international events. The economic foundation of the German Democratic Republic is constantly strengthening and expanding, and the trust of other countries in it is also increasing.

Grotewohl pointed out that the main effort of the treaty between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union signed in Moscow is to peacefully resolve the issue of the entire Germany. The negotiations held by the foreign ministers of the three Western powers and Brentano in New York will make the Geneva foreign ministers' conference face difficulties. It shows that the old forces that split Germany are active again.

Grotewohl then talked about the characteristics of the domestic situation in the German Democratic Republic, emphasizing that state power has been transferred into the hands of the people. All economic, social, and cultural elements of this country conform to the prerequisites for establishing a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany. The German Democratic Republic is the only country within Germany that truly safeguards the vital interests of the German nation and peace, and is the foundation of a peaceful and democratic Germany.

When talking about the reunification of Germany, Grotewohl pointed out: "Germans sit down at a table together" will be the focus of domestic German policy for a long time to come. The reunification of Germany is impossible without the decisive participation of the Germans themselves. At the same time, assistance from surrounding countries cannot be rejected in the work of reunifying Germany. Therefore, the German Democratic Republic will strengthen relations with all countries, especially with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, based on the principles of mutual recognition, respect for sovereignty, equality, and non-interference in internal affairs.

Grotewohl finally pointed out that the survival of the German Democratic Republic and its future development are fully guaranteed. This guarantee is its own strength, the Warsaw Pact, and the treaty between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union. Grotewohl expressed the hope that the Federal Republic of Germany would change its policy and agree to participate in the pan-European collective security treaty proposed by the Soviet Union, thereby creating prerequisites for establishing a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany.

After Grotewohl's speech, the head of the Soviet government delegation, Suslov, spoke.

Suslov said: The founding of the German Democratic Republic is a major event in the lives of the German people. It marks that after years of struggle, the German people have found the true path to democracy and freedom, and the correct path to peace and friendship and cooperation with the people of other countries. It has already achieved great success on the road of socialist construction.

Suslov continued: The government of the German Democratic Republic pursues a foreign policy of peace and friendship among all nations, and has achieved solid international prestige and the trust of all peoples in the past six years. Those countries with a total population of about one billion have now recognized the German Democratic Republic as an independent sovereign state. The German Democratic Republic has established a particularly close relationship with the Soviet Union, and the recently signed treaty between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic marks a new historical stage in the development of relations between the two countries.

Suslov said that some politicians in Western countries are advocating a view that whether the upcoming Geneva foreign ministers' conference is successful depends on the situation of resolving the issue of reunifying Germany. Suslov pointed out that it cannot be recognized that this view is correct. Due to West Germany's joining the North Atlantic Group and the Western European Union and its having already begun to realize re-militarization, the issue of reunifying Germany has been seriously complicated. The realistic path to solving this problem is to establish a European collective security system and for the two Germanies to cooperate and work together on the basis of peaceful and democratic policies. The German reunification problem cannot be solved by relying on a "position of strength" or by harming the interests of the German Democratic Republic.

Suslov also said that the German Democratic Republic plays an important role in the German people's struggle for peace and national unity, and the Soviet Union has always unswervingly supported the German Democratic Republic in this struggle. Suslov pointed out that in the face of the concerted efforts of the German people, the militarists' conspiracy to force the German people to accept the re-militarization of Germany and maintain the division of Germany will be powerless. The German working class undoubtedly plays a special role in this regard.

Suslov finally pointed out that the German working class has a glorious tradition and rich experience in struggle, and therefore also possesses all the necessary strength to ensure the peaceful and democratic development of Germany. The Soviet people deeply trust the German working class and believe that they are reliable and loyal allies. The road experienced by the German Democratic Republic has convinced people of this, and the leading role played by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the effective activities of the National Front are guarantees of this.

Subsequently, the heads of other foreign delegations attending the celebration ceremony also spoke.

After the conference ended, a grand festive artistic performance was held.

    庆祝德意志民主共和国成立六周年
    民主德国政府在柏林举行大会
    新华社柏林七日电　德意志民主共和国政府六日晚在柏林德国国家歌剧院举行德意志民主共和国成立六周年庆祝大会。
    德意志民主共和国总统皮克，总理格罗提渥，德国统一社会党第一书记、副总理乌布利希，人民议院第一副主席马特恩，副总理斯多夫、博尔茨、努舍克、舒尔茨、洛赫和各部部长，德国共产党中央委员会第一书记雷曼，民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席柯伦斯，德国前总理维尔特等人都出席了大会。
    到会者热烈欢迎以苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员兼书记苏斯洛夫为首的苏联政府代表团和中华人民共和国的代表、中华人民共和国驻德意志民主共和国特命全权大使曾涌泉以及波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古等国政府代表团和法国、意大利、奥地利、芬兰、瑞典、丹麦和其他许多欧洲国家兄弟共产党和工人党的代表。
    格罗提渥总理在会上讲话，到会的人们报以暴风雨般的掌声。
    格罗提渥首先指出：德意志民主共和国成立以来的这些年月是严重和艰苦劳动的年月。他说，我们过去这几年的全部劳动在很大的程度上是同国内和国际的事件联系着的。德意志民主共和国的经济基础在不断加强和扩大，别的国家对它的信任也日益增加。
    格罗提渥指出在莫斯科签订的德意志民主共和国和苏联关系条约的主要努力目标是要和平解决整个德国的问题。而西方三国外长和勃伦塔诺在纽约举行的谈判将使日内瓦外长会议面临困难。它表明分裂德国的那些旧势力又重新活跃起来了。
    格罗提渥然后谈到德意志民主共和国国内形势的特点，他着重指出：国家政权已经转入人民的手中。这个国家的经济、社会和文化的全部因素都符合于建立一个和平、民主和统一的德国的前提。德意志民主共和国是德国内部真正维护德国民族切身利益与和平的唯一的国家，是和平和民主的德国的基础。
    格罗提渥在谈到德国的重新统一问题时指出：“德国人坐到一张桌子旁边来”这句口号在很长的时期内还要作为德国国内政策的中心。没有德国人自己决定性地参加，德国的重新统一是不可能的。同时，在重新统一德国的工作中不能拒绝周围的一些国家的援助。因此，德意志民主共和国将根据互相承认、尊重主权、平等和不干涉内政的原则加强同一切国家的关系，特别是同苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家的关系。
    格罗提渥最后指出：德意志民主共和国的生存和它今后的发展是有充分的保证的。这种保证是，它本国的力量、华沙条约和德意志民主共和国和苏联关系条约。格罗提渥表示希望德意志联邦共和国会改变政策而同意参加苏联建议的全欧集体安全公约，从而为建立一个和平、民主和统一的德国创造前提。
    在格罗提渥讲话以后，苏联政府代表团团长苏斯洛夫讲了话。
    苏斯洛夫说：德意志民主共和国的成立是德国人民生活中的重大事件。它标志着德国人民在多年的斗争后找到了通往民主和自由的真正道路，通往和平和同其他国家的人民友好、合作的正确道路。它在社会主义建设的发展道路上已经取得很大的成就。
    苏斯洛夫接着说：德意志民主共和国政府执行和平和各国人民友好的外交政策，在过去六年中取得了稳固的国际威信和各国人民的信任。一共约有十亿人口的那些国家现在已经承认德意志民主共和国是独立的主权国家。德意志民主共和国同苏联建立了特别亲密的关系，最近签订的苏联和德意志民主共和国关系条约标志着两国关系发展上的新的历史阶段。
    苏斯洛夫说：西方国家的某些政治家正在宣扬一种观点，说即将举行的日内瓦外长会议有没有成就，要看解决重新统一德国的问题的情况怎样。苏斯洛夫指出：不能承认这种观点是正确的。由于西德加入北大西洋集团和西欧联盟并且已经开始实现重新军国主义化，重新统一德国问题已经严重地复杂化了。解决这个问题的现实道路是建立欧洲集体安全体系以及两个德国在和平民主政策的基础上实行合作和共同努力。靠“实力地位”或是损害德意志民主共和国利益的办法，是解决不了德国统一问题的。
    苏斯洛夫又说：德意志民主共和国在德国人民争取和平和民族统一的斗争中起着重要作用，苏联在这个斗争中始终不渝地支持德意志民主共和国。苏斯洛夫指出，在德国人民一致努力的面前，军国主义者强使德国人民接受德国重新军国主义化和保持德国分裂的阴谋将会无能为力，在这方面起有特别作用的，毫无疑问是德国工人阶级。
    苏斯洛夫最后指出：德国工人阶级拥有光荣的传统和丰富的斗争经验，因而也拥有一切必要力量保证德国的和平民主的发展。苏联人民深深信赖德国工人阶级，认为他们是可靠的和忠实的盟友。德意志民主共和国经历的道路使人相信了这一点，德国统一社会党所起的领导作用和全国阵线卓有成效的活动，就是这一点的保证。
    随后，参加庆祝典礼的其他外国代表团团长也都讲了话。
    在大会结束以后，举行了盛大的节日艺术表演。
