Xinhua News Agency, October 25th. Following closely on the heels of the National Conference on Writing Reform, the Academic Conference on Standardization of Modern Chinese opened in Beijing on the 25th. This conference marks the beginning of an organized and systematic study of the standard of Mandarin Chinese—the common language of the Han nationality—with Beijing pronunciation as its standard.

    Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered the opening address, explaining the two main tasks of the conference: to conduct in-depth research and widely publicize the importance of standardizing modern Chinese, and to organize language workers across the country to carry out planned division of labor and cooperation in promoting the standardization of modern Chinese. Guo Moruo said: The issue of modern Chinese standardization that we have raised is to promote the components of the Han nationality's common language to meet certain standards as much as possible; it is to take necessary steps, based on the laws of language development, to reduce divergence and confusion in its phonetics, grammar, and vocabulary, and to enhance its unity. The unification of phonetics is more important, because phonetic differences are the greatest. At the same time, the unification of phonetics is a necessary stage for the fundamental reform of writing. The unification of national languages ​​is an inevitable trend in the process of national development. In the past, we let it develop naturally, but today our country is concentrating its efforts on large-scale production and construction, and the people of the whole country have entered into increasingly broad collective life and common labor in various work positions. This makes a standardized and clear unified national common language even more urgently needed. At the same time, due to the development of culture and education, the importance of standardizing modern Chinese has become even more prominent, so we must promote the standardization of modern Chinese in a planned way.
    Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council, attended the meeting and gave important instructions. He pointed out that simplification of Chinese characters, standardization of modern Chinese, and the implementation of phonetic writing in some minority areas are the main tasks in current linguistic work, and experts should formulate implementation plans through repeated discussions. He also pointed out that at this conference, experts should reach a consensus on the issue of modern Chinese standardization through academic discussions. Only with a consensus among experts can there be a consensus on work plans, which will facilitate implementation throughout the country. He encouraged linguists to eliminate prejudices and sectarianism, respect different opinions, discuss and learn from each other, learn from others' strengths to make up for their own shortcomings, and use their own strengths to make up for others' shortcomings, so as to strengthen mutual unity. He pointed out that it is necessary to vigorously cultivate and develop new forces to do a good job in language research. He said: When we see a new generation growing up, our people's cause will have something to rely on, and we should cultivate new forces with infinite joy and full effort.
    Subsequently, Lü Shuxiang, Deputy Director of the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered a report on "The Standardization of Modern Chinese" at the meeting. Professor Serdyuchenko, Soviet advisor to the Institute of Linguistics, presented a report entitled "The Importance and Some Principles of Standardizing the Chinese Standard Language" to the conference. Lü Shuxiang's report explored three questions: why the issue of standardizing modern Chinese is being raised at this time, what principle issues need to be resolved in the standardization of modern Chinese, and how to carry out standardization work.
    This conference is convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and is scheduled to last for seven days. More than one hundred people are participating in the conference, including language research workers, language education workers, and representatives from literature, drama, film, opera, news, broadcasting, shorthand, translation and other fields that use language and writing from Beijing and other places. Relevant responsible personnel from the Party and government also attended the meeting. The Chinese Academy of Sciences also invited Soviet Chinese experts Professor Oshanin and Professor Golut, Polish Chinese experts Professor Szapszel and Professor Herman-Lewinsky to attend the meeting. Romanian linguist Academician Graur, who is currently visiting China, and Soviet cultural and educational chief advisor to the State Council, Maritsev, were also invited to attend the meeting.

    现代汉语规范问题学术会议开幕
    新华社二十五日讯　紧接着全国文字改革会议之后，现代汉语规范问题学术会议二十五日在北京开幕。这次会议是有组织、有系统地研究以北京语音为标准音的普通话——汉民族共同语的标准问题的开端。
    中国科学院院长郭沫若在会上致开幕词，他说明了这次会议的两个主要任务：深入研究和广泛宣传现代汉语规范化的重要性和组织全国语言工作者在促进现代汉语规范化方面进行有计划的分工合作。郭沫若说：我们所提出的现代汉语规范化问题，就是要促使汉民族共同语的组成成分尽可能合乎一定的标准；就是要根据语言发展的规律，采取必要的步骤，使它在语音、语法、词汇上减少分歧和混乱，增强统一性，其中更主要的是语音的统一，因为语音的分歧最大，同时，语音的统一也是文字根本改革的必经阶段，民族语言的统一是民族发展过程中的必然趋势，以往我们是听其自然漫衍而来，今天我们国家正集中力量进行大规模的生产建设，全国人民在各个工作岗位上进入了日益广泛的集体生活和共同劳动，这就更加迫切地需要一个规范明确的统一的民族共同语，同时由于文化教育的发展，现代汉语规范化的重要性就愈加显得突出，所以我们必须有计划地促进现代汉语的规范化。
    国务院副总理陈毅到会作了重要指示。他指出：汉字简化、现代汉语规范化和在一部分少数民族地区实行拼音文字这三方面，是当前语言学工作中的主要任务，专家们要经过反复讨论去制定出实施的方案。他又指出：在这次会议上，专家们要通过学术上的讨论，对现代汉语规范问题取得一致的意见，有了专家的一致，才有工作方案的一致，这样才便于在全国各地去推行。他勉励语言学工作者要消除成见和宗派主义思想，尊重不同的意见，互相商讨，学习，以别人之长，补自己的不足，以自己所长，补别人的不足，这样来加强互相间的团结。他指出：要大力培植和发扬新生力量，把语言研究工作做好。他说：当我们看见新的一代在长成时，我们的人民事业才算有了依靠，我们应该以无限的欢欣和用全力去培养新生力量。
    接着，中国科学院语言研究所副所长吕叔湘在会议上宣读了“现代汉语规范问题”的报告。语言研究所苏联顾问谢尔久琴柯教授向大会提出了题为“汉语标准语规范化的重要性和一些原则”的报告。吕叔湘的报告探讨了三个问题：为什么在这个时候提出现代汉语的规范问题，现代汉语的规范化有些什么原则性问题需要解决以及怎样进行规范化的工作。
    这次会议是中国科学院召开的，预定进行七天。参加会议的有北京和其他各地的语文研究工作者、语文教育工作者以及文学、戏剧、电影、曲艺、新闻、广播、速记、翻译等使用语言文字的代表共一百多人。参加会议的还有党和政府的有关负责人员。中国科学院并邀请了苏联的汉语专家鄂山荫教授和郭陆特教授、波兰汉语专家夏伯龙教授和赫曼来夫斯基教授参加会议。正在中国访问的罗马尼亚语言学家格拉乌尔院士以及国务院苏联文教总顾问马里采夫也应邀参加会议。
