Conscientiously Do a Good Job in Conserving Coal for Heating

To the Editor:

	The heating season is approaching. During this period, the national consumption of coal for heating will be at least ten million tons.

	According to a survey conducted by the China Coal Industry Building Materials Company in Beijing, there is great potential for saving coal for heating: For example, the average coal consumption of low-pressure heating boilers in various units is 80 jin per square chi of fire bed per day, with the highest reaching 118 jin and the lowest only needing 60 jin; and for heating stoves, according to the government's prescribed expenditure standards, the minimum saving can be 5%, and the maximum can be 42%; it is estimated that the general potential for saving coal in Beijing's institutions during the winter is still 10% to 20%. The situation in other regions is similar. Therefore, saving coal for heating, so that more "industrial grain" can be used in national construction, this work should attract widespread attention.

	In the past, some units did not pay enough attention to the work of saving coal for heating. Some leading staff members believe that since there is an expenditure standard for heating fees, it is enough to not exceed the standard for coal consumption; some managers regard adding more coal as the only way to ensure that the room is warm, and do not seek improvement in combustion technology. Therefore, some units have oversized boilers without reducing the fire bed, and even the phenomenon of "heating with the windows open" has occurred. Some units have thick rust and scale inside and outside the boiler, which is not removed. Some units have excessively wide boiler grates, and a lot of raw coal and slag are leaked and discarded as garbage. These situations should be corrected.

	In order to do a good job in saving coal for heating in major and medium-sized cities, first of all, the expenditure system for heating coal should be rationally stipulated. This requires the administrative departments of various regions to strengthen the review and control of the heating coal expenditure system in their respective regions, so that the system itself can play a role in promoting conservation. Last year, coal construction companies in various regions conducted investigations and studies on various coal consumption situations, and basically grasped the normal standards for heating coal consumption under different circumstances in different regions. This is a good reference material for the administrative departments of various regions to review and revise the heating fee expenditure system. The State Council's Bureau of Government Offices Administration, with reference to the data from the Beijing Coal Construction Company, lowered the expenditure standard for heating coal in Beijing in 1954-1955 by about 16%, and after the Coal Construction Company promoted experiences such as the "three combustion methods," more than 1,500 factories, institutions, and schools consumed 76,000 tons less coal than the lowered standard for the entire season, worth 1.5 million yuan.

	Secondly, due to the rapid increase in various heating boiler equipment in recent years, the number of skilled stoker workers cannot keep up with the demand, and the phenomenon of wasting fuel coal by temporary workers who do not understand technology is very common; therefore, coal-using units should do a good job in training stoker workers, strengthen ideological education for stoker workers, and establish a sound coal combustion management system. Before the heating period in 1954, the General Real Estate Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Company held a stoker training class, inviting veteran workers to spread the technical experience of burning boilers. In half a month, they trained more than 140 stoker workers with certain coal combustion knowledge, saving more than 3,000 tons of coal for the entire season. Seven universities and colleges in Haidian District, Beijing, jointly formed a "Coal Saving and Safety Mutual Aid Group" during the last winter heating season, regularly exchanging boiler combustion technology and conducting inspections, with good conservation results.

	Thirdly, the Coal Construction Company not only undertakes the task of supplying the daily-use coal needed nationwide, but also has the task of guiding consumption; therefore, it should continue to actively do a good job in organizing and publicizing the saving of coal for heating, vigorously disseminate advanced experience, and conduct in-depth technical guidance, so as to promote the saving of coal as a social ethos. During the 1954-1955 heating season, the Beijing Coal Construction Company, in conjunction with the People's Committees of various districts, convened several mobilization meetings for the general affairs personnel and management personnel of various coal-using units, introduced coal combustion technology, and the cleaning team cooperated in holding a "Furnace Ash Exhibition," which greatly promoted the progress of coal saving work. This practice should be widely promoted.

### 认真做好节约取暖用煤的工作

    认真做好节约取暖用煤的工作编辑同志：
    采暖季节快到了。在这个时期内，全国的取暖用煤至少在一千万吨以上。
    根据中国煤业建筑器材公司在北京市的调查，节约取暖用煤的潜力是很大的：如各单位的低压暖汽锅炉平均用煤量为每天每平方市尺火床用八十斤，最高的要用一百一十八斤，最低的只要六十斤就够了；又如取暖火炉用煤，按政府规定的开支标准，最少的可以节余百分之五，最多的能节余百分之四十二；估计北京市各机关冬季用煤一般都还有百分之十到二十的节约潜力。其他地区的情况也是这样。因此，节约取暖用煤，使更多的“工业的粮食”用到国家建设中去，这项工作应该引起普遍的注意。
    过去，某些单位对节约取暖用煤的工作是不够重视的。有的领导工作人员认为烤火费既有开支标准，烧煤量只要不超过标准就行；有些管理人员把多添煤当作保证屋里暖和的唯一办法，而不从烧火技术上求得改进。因此，有的单位锅炉过大，也不去缩小火床，甚至出现了“开着窗子烧暖汽”的现象。有的单位锅炉内外的水锈、烟垢很厚，也不清除。有的单位锅炉炉排过宽，漏下很多生煤和煤渣就当垃圾扔掉。这些情况都是应该纠正的。
    为了在各大、中城市做好节约取暖用煤的工作，首先，应该把取暖用煤的开支制度规定得合理。这就要求各地区的机关事务管理部门加强对本地区烤火煤开支制度的审查和掌握，使制度本身起到促进节约的作用。去年，各地煤建公司对各种用煤情况进行了调查研究，基本上已经掌握了在不同地区不同情况下的取暖煤用量的正常标准，这是各地区机关事务管理部门用以审查修订烤火费开支制度的很好的参考资料。国务院机关事务管理局参照北京市煤建公司的资料，把北京市一九五四—一九五五年烤火煤的开支标准调低了约百分之十六，并由煤建公司推行“三种烧火法”等经验后，光一千五百多个工厂、机关和学校，全季的实际烧煤量比调低后的标准还少七万六千多吨煤，值一百五十万元。
    其次，由于几年来各种暖汽锅炉设备迅速增加，熟练的司炉工人赶不上需要，不少单位临时雇用的工人不懂技术，糟蹋燃煤的现象很普遍；因此，各用煤单位应该做好司炉工人的培养工作，加强对司炉工人的思想教育，建立健全的烧煤管理制度。鞍山钢铁公司总房产处在一九五四年烤火期前，举办了一个司炉训练班，请老工人传播烧锅炉技术经验，半个月里培养了一百四十多名具有一定烧煤知识的司炉工人，全季节约了三千多吨煤。北京海淀区七个大、专学校，在去冬烤火季里共同组成了“节煤安全互助组”，定期交流烧锅炉技术，并进行巡回检查，节约效果良好。
    再次，煤建公司不但担负着供应全国所需的生活用煤的任务，同时也有指导消费的任务；因此应该继续积极地做好节约取暖用煤的组织工作和宣传工作，大力传播先进经验，深入地进行技术辅导，促使节约用煤成为社会风气。一九五四—一九五五年的烤火季中，北京市煤建公司曾经协同各区人民委员会召集各用煤单位的总务人员、管理人员开了几次动员会，介绍烧煤技术，并且由清洁队配合举办了“炉灰展览会”，大大促进了节煤工作的进展。这种做法应该普遍推广。张玉亭
