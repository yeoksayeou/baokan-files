    Indian Film Delegation Widely Interacts with Chinese Film Industry

    The Indian Film Delegation has been in Beijing for several days, engaging in extensive interactions with people in the Chinese film industry.

    On the afternoon of the 17th, the Indian Film Delegation held a forum with Chinese film directors, actors, screenwriters, technical experts, film critics, heads of film studios and film schools, and other film workers. At this forum, Wang Lanxi, Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, and Cai Chusheng, Deputy Director, introduced the organizational structure of China's film industry, film production, and the learning situation of film workers. P.L. Kappar, head of the Indian Film Delegation, Deputy Head B.N. Sircar, and members Krishna Gopal and Jagat Murari, all spoke, introducing the general overview of the Indian film industry and many aspects of technology and documentaries. During the discussion, both hosts and guests expressed their willingness to learn from each other, and both believed that film workers from China and India should further exchange experiences. In their speeches, Chinese film workers not only introduced the development of China's film industry, but also pointed out that there were still many shortcomings in their work, and hoped that Indian friends would offer their guidance. P.L. Kappar said in his speech: "You introduced the situation, but your eyes are always on your own shortcomings, which means that your standards are set very high, and you are determined to go far in the field of art. I congratulate you." He also believed that the Chinese dubbed translated films that the delegation saw after arriving in China "have achieved very high achievements."

    On the afternoon of the 18th, the delegation visited the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio. When the delegation arrived at the studio, the studio staff welcomed them warmly by playing gongs and drums, setting off firecrackers, and presenting and throwing countless flowers and paper flowers. In a studio, they met Mei Lanfang, a famous Chinese Peking Opera artist. On behalf of Indian film workers, the head of the delegation, P.L. Kappar, presented Mei Lanfang with an ivory carving. Then, they watched the performance of Mei Lanfang and Jiang Miaoxiang in the section of "The Goddess of the Luo River" in the color stage documentary "Mei Lanfang's Stage Art". At the studio, they also visited the recording studio and editing room, watched the sound and picture editing work of the film "Indian Cultural Delegation in China"; and watched a section of an Indian film they brought to China, a section of the sample film of "Mei Lanfang's Stage Art", and other Chinese newsreel documentaries.

    On the 19th, the delegation also visited the Great Wall and the Ming Tombs. Prior to this, they also visited the Forbidden City and Beihai Park.

    印度电影代表团同我电影界人士广泛接触
    印度电影代表团连日来在北京同中国的电影界人士广泛接触。
    印度电影代表团在十七日下午曾同中国电影界导演、演员、剧作家、技术专家、影评家、电影制片厂和电影学校负责人以及其他电影工作者举行座谈会。在这个座谈会上，文化部电影事业管理局局长王阑西和副局长蔡楚生介绍了中国电影事业的组织机构、影片的生产及电影工作者的学习情况。印度电影代表团团长普·拉·卡普尔、副团长布·纳·西尔卡和团员克里希纳·戈帕尔、贾加特·穆拉里都发了言，介绍了印度电影事业的概貌和技术、纪录片方面的许多情况。座谈时，宾主们都表示愿虚心向对方学习，并都认为中印两国电影工作者应进一步交流经验。中国电影工作者在发言中除介绍了中国电影事业的发展情况外，并指出在工作中还存在许多缺点，希望印度朋友予以指教。普·拉·卡普尔在发言时说：“你们介绍了情况，但眼睛时刻看着自己的缺点，这就是说，你们标准是放得很高的，你们决心在艺术领域中走得很远，我向你们表示祝贺。”他还认为代表团来到中国后所看到的中国译制的翻译片“达到了很高的成就”。
    十八日下午，代表团曾往中央新闻纪录电影制片厂参观。当代表团到达这个制片厂时，制片厂的员工们曾敲着锣鼓，放着鞭炮，向他们赠献和抛掷着无数的鲜花和纸花，热烈地欢迎他们。在一个摄影棚里，他们会见了中国京剧著名艺术家梅兰芳。团长普·拉·卡普尔代表印度电影工作者向梅兰芳赠送了一个象牙雕刻品。然后，他们观看了拍摄梅兰芳和姜妙香在彩色舞台纪录片“梅兰芳舞台艺术”中“洛神”的一段的表演。在制片厂，他们还参观了录音室和剪接室，观看了影片“印度文化代表团在中国”的音画剪接工作；并观看了他们带来中国的一部印度影片中的一段和“梅兰芳舞台艺术”样片中的一段及其他的中国新闻纪录影片。
    十九日，代表团还游览了长城和明十三陵。在此以前，他们还参观了故宫，游览了北海公园等。
