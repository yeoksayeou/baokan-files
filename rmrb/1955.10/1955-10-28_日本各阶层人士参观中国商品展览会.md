Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: People from all walks of life in Japan enthusiastically visited the Chinese Commodity Exhibition. Many expressed their hope that relations between China and Japan could be normalized soon after the visit.

    Japanese Socialist Party Member of Parliament and former Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama said after the visit: Holding commodity exhibitions to introduce each other's industries and cultures is the foundation of friendship and goodwill between the two countries. He expressed his agreement with the joint communiqué signed by Peng Zhen, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the NationalPeople's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and Sakae Kamabayashi, head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation to China. He pointed out that the issue of normalizing Sino-Japanese relations lies in how to promote the Japanese government. He believes that the Japanese people should make the greatest efforts to promote the Japanese government to normalize Sino-Japanese relations.

    Socialist Party Member of Parliament Toyoaki Ogawa said after the visit: He believes that no force can prevent friendly exchanges and economic exchanges between China and Japan.

    Socialist Party Member of Parliament Akira Kazami said after the visit: People from all walks of life in Japan come to visit this commodity exhibition, which shows the Japanese people's concern for China and the friendship between the two peoples.

    Democratic Party Member of the House of Representatives Tokutaro Kitamura wrote in the opinion book after the visit: The great face of New China is neatly displayed in front of us. The friendship and goodwill between China and Japan will increase day by day.

    Socialist Party Councilor Masaru Nozoe said after the visit regarding the joint communiqué signed by Peng Zhen and Sakae Kamabayashi: This joint communiqué pointed out the minimum conditions for the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. It is only natural to establish this commodity exhibition as a permanent institution in order to expand trade relations between China and Japan. He said: The Socialist Party fully supports this joint communiqué. Keijiro Kamiho, head of the Yokohama Chamber of Commerce and Industry delegation, said after the visit: He believes that in the near future, it will definitely be possible to freely develop mutually beneficial trade with China on an equal footing. Goro Adachi, the mayor of Otaru City from Hokkaido, said after the visit: Visiting this commodity exhibition will make it clear the great development and achievements of China. He also expressed the hope that Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations will be restored soon.

    Sixteen members of the Ibaraki Prefectural Assembly visited the Chinese Commodity Exhibition together on the 26th. Fumitsugu Hata, Chairman of the Commerce and Industry Committee of the Ibaraki Prefectural Assembly, said after the visit: We would like to express our respect to the Chinese people and their leaders who have developed the industrial economy to this level. At the same time, we want to make the greatest efforts to develop friendly exchanges and economic exchanges between China and Japan.

    What is particularly touching is that seventy-eight students from a school for the blind in Tokyo also visited the exhibition under the leadership of Principal Kotsuichi Takahashi. While listening to the teacher's explanations, they touched various exhibits such as mineral sand, agricultural products, and machines with their hands. They said after the visit: When we learned that visiting this commodity exhibition could make us understand the great development of neighboring China, all the students came together. They said: Although we cannot see things, we can also understand with our hands that China has abundant resources and produces excellent machines and various items. They hope to be good friends with the Chinese people soon. (Attached picture)
