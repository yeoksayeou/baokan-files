    The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant Today
    Li Zhongyi
    One day in September, I visited the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, which had been under construction for two years and two months.
    The soft September sun shone on the earth, and the mature sorghum, beans, and corn by the roadside swayed lazily in the breeze. Sitting in the suburban tram, I recalled my first visit to the automobile factory construction site two years ago, when I had stepped through snow that went above my ankles, carefully dodging sorghum stalks, and walking gingerly on the ridges of the fields. Now, tram lines have been laid... At this moment, the tram suddenly crossed a bridge and entered a bustling new street.
    New buildings with auburn brick walls stood on both sides of the street. Here were department stores, Xinhua bookstores, People's Banks, canteens, schools, post and telecommunications offices, laundry and dyeing service stations... Loudspeakers broadcast news and music, and automobiles, horse-drawn carts, bicycles, and pedestrians bustled about.
    From the brightly colored pavilion-style tower on the roof of the department store, I recognized this as the workers' living area of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. However, it was no longer the scene I had seen last time: the glass windows, once covered in white ash stains and dust, were now sparkling clean. The balconies, originally showing iron reinforcement, had been fitted with carved railings, with clothes drying, flower pots placed, and some even had radio antennas. The once-silent empty rooms were now filled with lively men and women workers wearing blue work clothes with a truck logo printed on the left chest, and their families. Every room radiated a cheerful and happy atmosphere. Roads that were once too muddy to walk on after rain were being paved with stones and asphalt, and the road roller made a "putt-putt" sound as it rolled back and forth. The news broadcast by the loudspeakers by the roadside said: The workers of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant will launch enthusiastic voluntary labor, and will build a club in the living area before winter, ready for film screenings and other recreational activities...
    The tram traveled along the new street. When I arrived in front of the factory area, I felt as if I were in a magnificent painting, with huge, towering workshops, corridors soaring in the air, thick black pipes, water towers, chimneys... intertwined together.
    At the end of the wide, stone-paved central avenue was the tallest factory building, its four parallel chimneys towering into the sky. This was the heart of the entire plant—the thermal power station.
    Walking into the thermal power station, a train was pulling into the coal bunker, unloading coal into the underground coal depot. The underground coal conveyor rumbled, loading coal onto the conveyor belt. The coal passed through ball mills and separators, was ground into pure coal powder, and finally was sent to the boiler by automatic devices.
    Inside the boiler room, blowers roared, blowing giant winds into the boilers, and the boilers, tens of meters high, burned fiercely. The workers firing the boilers sat calmly in front of the control panels. By watching the rotation of various instruments on the control panel, they could clearly know the operating conditions of various parts of the boiler. We usually associate boiler workers with smoke, dust, and heavy physical labor, but the workers here operated in a bright, comfortable, and clean environment.
    The heat and power from the boiler propelled the turbo generator. The main shaft of the turbine rotated rapidly. But our naked eyes could not see the main shaft rotating, only the lubricating oil on the main shaft churning like waves in the glass tube. Workers of the Li Runzhou team in the turbine workshop stood in front of the instrument panel, carefully watching the automatic records and various signals. Most of them were young technicians who had been transferred after studying at power plants in various places for about a year. Although their technical level was not high, because they loved their work, they put forward eleven rationalization proposals in half a month in August. For example, they suggested changing the industrial water used for the oil cooler to circulating water from the water tower, saving the country more than one hundred tons of water per hour. The employees of the thermal power station, which was only put into production on July 1st, have made excellent achievements in the short three-month production process. In July, it took 0.861 kilograms of coal to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity, which was reduced to 0.629 kilograms in August.
    I couldn't help but recall the snow-covered thermal power station construction site two years ago, when workers were burning charcoal stoves in grass sheds to begin groundbreaking. Now, it emits huge amounts of heat and electricity every hour.
    I came out of the thermal power station and went to the auxiliary workshops. Here, the workers in the tool, die, and forging die workshops were working intensely. The thermal power station and auxiliary workshops are the main auxiliary production departments that guarantee the production of automobiles. Manufacturing a car requires millions of kinds of cutting tools, measuring tools, auxiliary tools, dies, hot forging dies, and other precision tools, and the workshops of the auxiliary workshop are responsible for manufacturing these precision tools. In April of this year, the workshops of the auxiliary workshop were the first to be put into production, preparing conditions for the formal production of automobiles. In the past few months, they have overfulfilled their tasks. The production of the first batch of automobiles requires 9,101 kinds of self-made tools, and 4,731 kinds have already been made. Guo Jinghua, a grinding worker in the Tool Workshop One, was standing next to a cylindrical grinder, grinding plug gauges. The tolerance for this type of plug gauge is stipulated to not exceed 0.001 mm, which means it must not exceed one-seventieth of a hair. He not only guaranteed the quality but also met the planned target ten days ahead of schedule. However, Guo Jinghua is just a second-level technician who recently graduated from the automobile technical school. The cutting tool section of Tool Workshop One has researched and trial-produced a very complex and precise "broach" that China has never produced before.
    I went to the basic production workshop to take a look. In September, eight basic production workshops have already begun adjusting production.
    In the chassis workshop, which produces automobile chassis, only 70 percent of the machinery and equipment has been installed, but it already looks like a vast ocean of machines. Jiang Zhongmin, a gear machine tool adjuster, was skillfully adjusting a straight bevel gear milling machine. He was originally a fitter. In November 1953, the Party organization sent him to the Stalin Automobile Factory in the Soviet Union to study gear machine adjustment. There, he received enthusiastic help from Soviet teachers. A gear engineer was specifically responsible for teaching him, holding his hand to show him how to operate. When he couldn't understand the Russian names of many machine parts, the engineer patiently wrote the letters on his hand. After he had initially mastered the adjustment techniques, the engineer immediately let him practice repeatedly on the machine tool, carefully watching him from the side. If he found that he had made a mistake in his operation, he immediately pressed down with his finger, told him where the mistake was, and wrote it in his notebook so that he would not forget it again. When Jiang Zhongmin became a skilled gear machine adjuster and returned to China, the engineer also earnestly told him to continue to study hard, and to write to him if he had any questions. Thanks to the sincere and selfless help of the Soviet teacher, he is already an excellent gear machine adjuster in the workshop. Now, he quickly adjusts the various gear machines that have been installed and begins to produce various gears on the chassis. He pointed to a new type of spiral bevel gear milling machine and said: "This is the latest Soviet gear machine tool, and the first one produced was sent to our country." His eyes sparkled with a happy light. Currently, under the guidance of Soviet experts, the chassis workshop has begun to produce some of the main components of the "rear axle" of the chassis.
    In order to speed up production preparation work, many workshops are installing and adjusting one machine tool as conditions permit, and adjusting one production line as soon as it is installed. On September 26, the non-ferrous metal casting workshop started the newly installed aluminum smelting equipment, melted the first furnace of aluminum water, and pressed aluminum pistons with steel molds. The air hammer in the forging workshop was ignited and started hammering after installation, producing forgings.
    For two years, the civil engineering workers, who had victoriously built huge factory buildings on a wilderness, were working hard. However, like making clothes, they were no longer cutting cloth, but sewing on buttons, carrying out finishing projects. The employees building the foundry workshop are carrying out roof, corridor, and wall construction projects. This workshop, which is complex in engineering and started the latest, will be basically completed before winter. Tao Haoran, the head of the technical section of the work area, is arranging construction technical measures after the atmospheric temperature drops. You might think he is an engineer! No, before participating in the construction, he was originally an operations staff officer in the army. At that time, everything about the construction project was unfamiliar to him. However, through the training of the great construction project, he has become a very good construction commander. This is not an isolated case. With the growth of the construction project, a strong construction and installation team has grown and strengthened day by day. The Zhao Chuanlian team of the Electromechanical Installation Company is pulling trolleys to install large special machine tools such as flat forging machines, forging presses, and air hammers in the forging workshop. Some of these machine tools are so large that they look like mountains of steel. The workers of the Zhao Chuanlian team said: We had never seen or even heard of these machine tools before. Because they diligently studied the drawings and learned while doing, they have always excellently completed the installation tasks and become the main force in installing large special machine tools.
    Currently, civil engineering, installation, and pipeline workers are closely coordinating and cooperating in order to create conditions for production and installation after winter, striving to supply gas, electricity, and heating before the end of October. Every day, telephone conferences are held in each work area and headquarters. If you participate in a telephone conference, sitting in front of the radio, you will hear the exciting and boiling voices of each work area, as if you are in a telephone conference described in the novel "Far From Moscow". From those short, excited words, you will truly feel that the great motherland is moving forward every minute and every second.

    今日的第一汽车制造厂
    李中翼
    九月的一天，我去访问已经建设了两年零两个月的第一汽车制造厂。
    九月的柔和的阳光照着大地，路旁成熟了的高粱、豆子、玉米在徐风中懒散地摇摆。坐在郊区的电车里，我想起两年以前第一次去访问汽车厂工地的时候，曾经踏着深没脚踝的雪，小心地躲闪高粱楂子，深一脚浅一脚地走在田埂上。而现在已经敷设上了电车线路……这时候，电车忽然越过桥梁，进入了一条热闹的新街道。
    一幢一幢枣红色砖墙的新楼，林立在街道两旁。这里有百货公司、新华书店、人民银行、食堂、学校、邮电局、洗染服务站……扩音器播送着新闻、音乐、汽车、马车、自行车和行人熙熙攘攘。
    从百货公司屋顶上鲜艳的凉亭式的塔楼，我认出这是第一汽车制造厂的职工生活区。但是，已经不是我上次看到的情景了：原先满是白灰污点和尘土的玻璃窗，现在擦得亮亮堂堂。原先露着铁筋的阳台，已经砌上雕花栏杆，上面晒着衣服，放着花盆，有的还架着收音机的天线杆。原先寂静的空房间，现在住满了生气勃勃的穿着左胸前印有一辆载重汽车标志的蓝色工作服的男女工人和他们的家属。每个房间都洋溢着愉快、幸福的气氛。雨后泥泞得不能行走的道路，正在铺石块、沥青，压路机发着突突的声音来回地辗压。路旁扩音器播送的新闻说：第一汽车制造厂职工将展开热烈的义务劳动，要在冬季以前在生活区盖起一座俱乐部，准备放映电影和作其它文娱活动用……
    电车在新的街道上穿行。到达厂区前面的时候，我好像置身在一幅壮阔的图画中，巨大、巍峨的场房，凌驾在空中的走廊，粗黑的管道、水塔、烟囱……交织在一起，连成一片。
    宽阔的铺着石头的中央大道的末端，是一幢最高的厂房，它那四根并列的烟囱耸入天空。这是全厂的心脏——热电站。
    走进热电站，一列火车正开进煤仓，把煤倾卸到地下煤库里。地下输煤机隆隆地转动，把煤装到输送带上。煤块经过球磨机、分离器，被辗成毫无杂质的煤粉，最后被自动装置送到锅炉里。
    锅炉房内，鼓风机呼呼地向锅炉喷着巨风，数十公尺高的锅炉猛烈地燃烧着。烧锅炉的工人安详地坐在操纵盘前。他只要看着操纵盘上各种仪表的转动，就可以清楚地晓得锅炉各部分运转的情况，我们通常提到锅炉工人就很自然地联想到煤烟、灰尘和繁重的体力劳动，这里的工人们却在光亮、舒畅、洁净的环境中操作。
    锅炉的热和力推动了透平发电机。透平机的主轴迅速地旋转。但是我们的肉眼看不出主轴在旋转，只看到主轴上的润滑油在玻璃管内像浪涛似地翻腾。透平车间李润州小组的工人正站在仪表盘前，仔细地看着自动记录和各种信号。他们大多数都是在各地发电厂学习过一年左右就调来的青年技工。技术水平虽然不高，但是由于他们热爱自己的工作，在八月份的半个月中就提出了十一项合理化建议。例如他们建议把冷油器用的工业水改为用水塔的循环水，一小时就给国家节省一百多吨水。七月一日才投入生产的热电站的职工，在短短三个月的生产过程中做出了优异的成绩。七月份发一度电需要煤○·八六一公斤，八月份减少到○·六二九公斤。
    我不禁回想起前年大雪纷飞的热电站工地，那时工人们在草棚里烧着木炭火炉开始破土奠基，现在它却每小时发出巨量的热和电了。
    我从热电站出来到辅助工场去。这里工具、冲模、锻模等车间的职工正在紧张地工作。热电站和辅助工场都是保证生产汽车的主要辅助生产部门。制造一辆汽车需要千万种刃具、量具、辅具、冲模、热锻模等精密的工具，辅助工场的各车间就担负制造这些精密工具的任务。今年四月间，辅助工场各车间首先投入了生产，为将来正式生产汽车准备条件，几个月来都超额完成了任务。生产第一批汽车需要自制的九千一百零一种工具，现在已经制成四千七百三十一种。工具一车间研磨工郭景华，正站在外圆磨床旁研磨塞规。这种塞规的公差规定不得超过○·○○一公厘，也就是说不得超过一根头发的七十分之一。他不但保证了质量，而且提前十天达到了计划指标。然而郭景华只不过是个不久前才从汽车技工学校毕业的二级技术工人。工具一车间刃具工部已经研究试制出一种非常复杂精密的我国从来没有生产过的“拉刀”。
    我又到基本生产车间去看一看。九月份已经有八个基本生产车间开始调整生产了。
    在生产汽车底盘的底盘工场，机械设备才安装上百分之七十，但是已经像浩荡的机器海洋了。齿轮机床调整工蒋忠民正在熟练地调整直齿伞齿轮铣齿机。他原是一个钳工，一九五三年十一月，党组织派他到苏联斯大林汽车工厂去学习调整齿轮机。在那里，他受到了苏联老师的热情帮助，一位齿轮工程师专门负责教他，把着手告诉他怎样操作。他对许多机器部件的俄文名字弄不懂时，工程师就耐心地把字母记在他的手上。在他初步掌握了调整技术以后，工程师立刻让他反复地在机床上实习，自己站在旁边仔细地看，发现他操作错了，立刻用手指按住，告诉他错在那里，并写在他的笔记本上让他别再忘了。当蒋忠民成为一个熟练的齿轮机调整工回国的时候，工程师还谆谆地嘱咐他继续努力学习，有什么问题写信来问。由于苏联老师真诚和无私的帮助，他已经是车间里优秀的齿轮机调整工了。现在，他把安装完毕的各种齿轮机迅速地调整好，开始生产底盘上各种齿轮。他指着一台新型的螺旋形伞齿轮铣齿机说：“这是苏联最新的齿轮机床，生产出第一台就送给我国了。”他的眼睛里闪耀着一股幸福的光彩。目前，在苏联专家的指导下，底盘车间已经开始生产底盘的“后桥”部分的一些主要部件。
    为了加速生产准备工作，许多车间是在可能的条件下，安装一台机床就调整一台机床，安装一?生产线就调整一?生产线。九月二十六日，有色金属铸件车间把刚安装好的炼铝设备开动起来，镕炼出第一炉铝水，用钢模压制出铝活塞。锻工车间的空气锤，安装后就点火开锤，生产锻件。
    两年来，在一片旷野上胜利地盖起一座座巨大厂房的土建工人，正在紧张地工作。不过，像做衣服一样，他们已经不是裁衣料，而是钉扣子，进行结尾工程了。建设铸工场的职工们，正在进行屋面、通廊、砌墙等工程。这座工程复杂，开工最晚的工场，将在冬季前基本落成。工区技术科长陶浩然正在布置大气温度下降后的施工技术措施。你也许以为他是一位工程师吧！不是的。在参加建设前，他原来是部队的作战参谋，当时，建设工程上的一切，对于他都是生疏的。但是，在伟大的建设工程的锻炼中，他已经成为一个很好的施工指挥员了。这不是个别的事例，随着建设工程的成长，一支强大的建筑和安装队伍已经日益成长、壮大起来。机电安装公司的赵传濂小组在拉着滑车安装锻工车间的平锻机、锻压机、气锤等大型特殊机床。这些机床有的大得简直像一座钢铁的山。赵传濂小组工人说：这些机床我们过去不但没有看见过，甚至没有听说过。由于他们刻苦地钻研图纸，边学边做，一直出色地完成了安装任务，成为安装大型特殊机床的主力了。
    目前，土建、安装和管道工人为了给入冬后进行生产和安装创造条件，正紧密地配合、协作，争取在十月底以前通煤气，通电，通暖气。每天，各工区和指挥部都召开电话会议。如果你参加一次电话会议，坐在收音机前就会听到各个工区激动的沸腾的声音，就像置身在“远离莫斯科的地方”小说所描写的电话会议一样。从那些短促的充满兴奋的话语中，你会切实地感到伟大的祖国每分每秒钟都在前进。
