Xinhua News Agency, October 18th News: According to a dispatch from the Chiang Kai-shek "Central News Agency" in Tokyo on the 17th, the Japanese government has reached an "agreement" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, preparing to "expeditiously" escort Chinese overseas citizens detained in the "detention center" set up by the Japan Ministry of Justice Immigration Bureau in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture, to Taiwan.

As previously reported, this illegal behavior by the Japanese government has aroused protests from Chinese public opinion, and the Chinese people demand that the Japanese government change this improper attitude.

The Chiang Kai-shek "Consulate General" stationed in Yokohama, Japan, revealed on the 17th that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is preparing to forcibly transport a total of 150 overseas Chinese to Taiwan this time. The Japanese government has chartered the "Hakuryu Maru" ship to help the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique realize this sinister plan. The "Hakuryu Maru" is scheduled to carry this group of overseas Chinese to Keelung on November 2nd.

According to the Japan Immigration Bureau, approximately fifty more overseas Chinese will continue to be detained in the Hamamatsu "detention center" because they firmly rejected the Japanese-Chiang "joint proposal" to send them to Taiwan.

The news said that most of the Chinese detained in the Hamamatsu "detention center" are overseas Chinese who have been designated as having entered Japan illegally, and overseas Chinese whose permitted period of residence in Japan has expired and whose extension of residence has been refused by the Japan Immigration Bureau. Among them, many have been detained in this "detention center" by the Japanese government for more than two years. The news also revealed that the overseas Chinese detained in the "detention center" are "subjected to abuse and malnutrition." The Japan Immigration Bureau also admitted that the "food and facilities" in the "detention center" are "poor."

    日本政府同蒋贼集团勾结
    准备把旅日华侨送往台湾
    新华社十八日讯　据蒋贼“中央社”东京十七日电透露，日本政府已经同蒋介石卖国集团达成“协议”，准备“从速”把被拘留在日本法务省出入国境管理局设在静冈县滨松“收容所”里的中国旅日侨民押送到台湾。
    前已报道，日本政府的这种非法行为已激起中国舆论的抗议，中国人民要求日本政府改变这种不正当的态度。
    蒋贼驻日本横滨的“总领事馆”在十七日透露，蒋介石卖国集团这次准备总共强运一百五十名华侨到台湾去。日本政府已经租用“白龙丸”轮船来帮助蒋介石卖国集团实现这个罪恶计划。“白龙丸”预订在十一月二日载运这批华侨前往基隆。
    据日本出入国境管理局透露，还有约五十名华侨因为坚决拒绝把他们送往台湾的日蒋“联合建议”，将被继续拘留在滨松“收容所”。
    消息说：被拘留在滨松“收容所”的中国人，大部分是被指为非法进入日本的华侨和准予在日本居留的期限已满而日本出入国境管理局拒绝延长居留期限的华侨。他们当中，很多人被日本政府拘留在这个“收容所”里已经有两年多。消息还透露，被拘留在“收容所”的华侨“受到虐待和营养不良”。日本出入国境管理局也承认“收容所”的“食物和设备恶劣”。
