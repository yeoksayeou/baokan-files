Xinhua News Agency, Bournemouth Dispatch: The British Conservative Party's annual conference was held in Bournemouth from October 6th to 8th.

    At the meeting on the 6th, the first proposal to be discussed called on the government to strengthen the economic ties and traditional relations between Britain and the members of the Commonwealth. Walker, the representative of the Dartford Conservative Party organization, expressed concern about the instability of Britain's trade ties with the United States when he put forward this proposal, and demanded that the government do its utmost to encourage British capital to invest in various countries of the British Empire.
    Another representative, Richardson, spoke in support of this proposal. He pointed out that American investment in the countries of the British Empire is increasing, which is dangerous for Britain. He said: The United States has squeezed out Britain's leading position in capital exports to Canada, and the United States now controls one-third of all investment in Canada, while Britain's share is shrinking. According to Richardson, the situation in Australia is the same. In Australia, "American capital is flowing in on a large scale."
    The meeting unanimously passed this proposal.
    The meeting then discussed the British economic situation, and in particular a proposal in favor of the government's economic measures.
    Smith said he opposed the proposal because everyone, including members of the government, understood that the country's economic situation had deteriorated significantly. Smith said: In view of rising prices and inflation, voters have expressed concern and dissatisfaction.
    In answering the representatives' speeches, Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler stated that the government intends to stipulate reductions in spending on housing construction and public health undertakings, reduce investment in state-owned industries, and reject demands for wage increases. The government intends to cut domestic consumption in order to encourage exports.
    After some discussion, the proposal passed by a majority (twenty representatives voted against).
    At the meeting on the 7th, the debate on foreign policy began.
    A proposal submitted for consideration by the meeting welcomed the government's achievements in seeking stable peace and security, and expressed its support for all further measures to reduce the threat of war.
    Many speakers in the debate praised the bankrupt policy of proceeding from a "position of strength."
    However, Straubenzee emphasized in his speech that the main achievement at present is the "Geneva spirit." He called for maintaining and consolidating this spirit through patient negotiations between foreign ministers.
    Foreign Secretary Macmillan spoke on behalf of the government in the debate. He said that he would be satisfied if the upcoming Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference could achieve some practical progress. He did not expect amazing results. On the one hand, he expressed his willingness to consider the Soviet Union's opinions on the issue of European security in the spirit of reaching an agreement. On the other hand, he revealed that Western countries are drawing up a plan to try to bring a reunified Germany into the North Atlantic bloc.
    After Macmillan's speech, the meeting passed the proposal.
    British Prime Minister Eden delivered a speech to the representatives attending the Conservative Party's annual conference on the 8th. Eden said: "Our primary task at home is to fight our economic problems." These economic problems "are quite tricky, but they were worse in the past." Eden said that as soon as Parliament convenes, the government's economic plan will be announced. He also said that these economic measures "must mainly reduce excessive domestic demand for our resources."
    Eden praised the leaders of the Trades Union Congress, saying that he eagerly hoped to see the growth of what he called "partnership in industry" in labor-management relations.
    Turning to foreign affairs, Eden repeated what he said at the last meeting of the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference: "If we can continue to work together in the spirit of this conference, then what is hopeful today should become a reliable reality as the situation develops." Eden said, I don’t think it is necessary to change these words, nor to revise its emphasis in any way.
    At the same time, Eden emphasized when assessing the prospects for the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference that "the process of diplomacy is slow." He also expressed his opinion, saying: "It is entirely possible that they will adjourn after several weeks of negotiations without making any progress."
    In analyzing the international situation, Eden said that the international situation had improved in the past year. He said: "Today, the international anxiety in Europe and the Far East is not as intense as it was a year ago."
    Talking about disarmament, Eden said: "The first goal is to ease the tensions at the points of contact between countries. To this end, I put forward a plan in Geneva. The next thing depends on the progress of the German reunification issue."
    Eden continued, on the issue of atomic and hydrogen weapons, "The issue of inspection and supervision is a very important issue. Many proposals have been discussed. But I don't think any country has found a final solution so far. We have made constructive suggestions several times. There is no doubt that these suggestions can be improved. We are ready to discuss them and other suggestions and plans at any time in order to find a solution, which we must do."
    But Eden went on to advocate continuing to pursue a policy of "proceeding from a position of strength" and "strengthening Western military defenses."
    He said: "This does not mean that our defense plan must be immutable... We must take into account our overseas obligations and the cost of our plans."
    Eden finally said that the British government has decided that "by the end of the 1957-58 fiscal year, the number of personnel in the armed services will be reduced by approximately 100,000 from the current number."

    英国保守党年会在菩恩穆斯举行
    据新华社讯　菩恩穆斯消息：英国保守党年会十月六日至八日在菩恩穆斯举行。
    在六日会议上，会议要讨论的第一个提案要求政府加强英国同英联邦各成员国的经济联系和传统关系。达特福德保守党组织的代表华克尔在提出这个提案时，对英国同美国的贸易联系的不稳定情况表示忧虑，并且要求政府尽全力鼓励英国资本在英帝国各国投资。
    另一个代表理查逊发言支持这个提案。他指出，美国在英帝国各国投资在增加，这对英国是危险的。他说：美国已经把英国对加拿大资本输出的第一位排挤掉了，美国现在控制着加拿大全部投资的三分之一，而英国的比重正在缩小。据理查逊说，澳大利亚的情况也一样，在澳大利亚，“美国资本大规模流入”。
    会议一致通过了这个提案。
    会议接着讨论了英国的经济情况，特别讨论了赞成政府的经济措施的一个提案。
    史密斯说，他反对这个提案，因为每个人，包括政府成员在内，都明白国家的经济情况已经大大恶化了。史密斯说：鉴于物价上涨和通货膨胀，选民们都表示忧虑和不满。
    财政大臣巴特勒在回答代表们的发言时，表示：政府打算规定降低住宅建筑和公共卫生事业方面的开支，减少在国营工业方面的投资和拒绝提高工资的要求。政府打算削减国内消费，以便鼓励出口。
    在经过一番讨论以后，这个提案以多数通过（二十个代表投票反对）。
    在七日会议上，开始进行外交政策的辩论。
    提交会议考虑的一个提案表示欢迎政府在谋求稳定的和平和安全方面所获得的成就，并且表示它支持一切足以减少战争威胁的进一步措施。
    在辩论中有许多发言者赞扬从“实力地位”出发的破产了的政策。
    然而，斯特劳本齐在发言中着重指出，当前主要的成就是“日内瓦精神”。他要求通过外长们之间的耐心的谈判保持和巩固这种精神。
    外交大臣麦克米伦代表政府在辩论中发了言。他说，如果即将举行的日内瓦四国外长会议能得出某些实际的进展，他就感到满意了。他并不期望惊人的结果。他一方面表示愿意本着达到协议的精神在欧洲安全问题上考虑苏联的意见，另一方面又透露，西方国家正在拟订一个计划，设法把重新统一后的德国拉入北大西洋集团。
    麦克米伦发言后，会议通过了这个提案。
    英国首相艾登在八日向出席保守党年会的代表发表了演说。艾登说：“我们在国内的首要任务是同我们的经济问题进行斗争。”这些经济问题“是相当棘手的，但是它们在过去更糟糕。”艾登说，一俟议会开会，就将宣布政府的经济计划。他又说，这些经济措施“必须主要是减少国内对我们的资源的过分需求”。
    艾登赞扬职工大会的领袖们，他说，他迫切希望在劳资关系方面看到他所谓的“工业中的合伙关系”的增长。
    艾登在转而谈到外交问题时重复了他在日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议最后一次会议上的话：“如果我们能够本着这个会议的精神继续共同努力，那末，今天还是有希望的东西应当随着局势的发展而成为可靠的现实。”艾登说，我认为不需要改变这些话，也不需要在任何方面修正它的侧重点。
    同时，艾登在估计即将举行的四国外长会议的前景时强调说，“外交的过程是缓慢的”。他并且表示意见说：“他们在经过几个星期的谈判后在没有取得任何进展的情况下休会也是十分可能的。”
    艾登在分析国际局势时说，国际局势在过去一年中已经改善，他说：“今天在欧洲和远东国际上的焦虑情绪已经没有一年前那么剧烈了。”
    谈到裁军问题时，艾登说：“第一个目标是要缓和各国接触点的紧张局势。为此目的，我在日内瓦提出了一个计划。下一回要看德国统一问题的进展如何而定。”
    艾登接着说，在原子武器和氢武器问题上，“监察和监督问题是非常重要的问题。已经讨论过许多建议。但是我不认为任何一个国家到目前为止已经找到一个最后的解决方案。我们好几次提出建设性的建议。毫无疑问，这些建议是有改进的余地的。我们准备随时讨论它们以及其他的建议和计划，以便找到一个解决方案，这是我们必须做的。”
    但是艾登接着鼓吹继续奉行“从实力地位出发”和“加强西方军事防御力量”的政策。
    他说：“这并不是说，我们的防御计划必须是一成不变的……我们必须考虑到我们的海外义务和我们计划的费用。”
    艾登最后说，英国政府已经决定，“到一九五七—五八年财政年度结束时，各军种的人数将从现在的数字裁减约十万人。”
