Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 14th -- News from Tokyo: The left and right wings of the Japanese Socialist Party held a unification conference in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 13th, announcing their re-merger into the "Japan Socialist Party." The Socialist Party split in October 1951 due to differing opinions on the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty."

The unification conference issued a declaration stating that the Japan Socialist Party would oppose all war policies, make every effort to strive for and ensure peace, and strive for Japan's independence. The Socialist Party's program opposes Japan's current rearmament, advocates the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the "Administrative Agreement," the revision of all unequal treaties, and the complete recovery of diplomatic autonomy. The program also advocates concluding a treaty with the Soviet Union with the main purpose of ending the state of war and restoring peaceful diplomatic relations, and striving to realize the normalization of genuine diplomatic relations with the government of the People's Republic of China. The program also advocates "carrying out a peaceful revolution in Japan to realize a socialist society."

The conference elected the leading cadres of the Socialist Party. Suzuki Mosaburo, chairman of the left-wing Socialist Party, was elected chairman of the Socialist Party, and Asanuma Inejirō, secretary-general of the right-wing Socialist Party, was elected secretary-general of the Socialist Party. The new Central Executive Committee is composed of twenty members from each of the two factions of the Socialist Party.

After the merger of the two Socialist Parties, it has become the largest opposition party in the Japanese Diet. In the entire House of Representatives with 467 seats, the Socialist Party occupies 155 seats; in the entire House of Councillors with 250 seats, the Socialist Party occupies 70 seats.

    日本两派社会党重新合并为日本社会党
    新华社十四日讯　东京消息：日本左、右两派社会党十三日下午在东京举行统一大会，宣告重新合并成为“日本社会党”。社会党是在一九五一年十月由于对旧金山和约和美日“安全条约”发生分歧意见而分裂的。
    统一大会发表宣言表示，日本社会党将反对一切战争政策，竭尽全力争取和平和确保和平，并且争取日本的独立。社会党的纲领反对日本目前的重整军备，主张取消日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”，改订一切不平等条约，完全收回外交的自主权。纲领并且主张和苏联缔结以结束战争状态和恢复和平邦交为主要目的的和约，设法实现和中华人民共和国政府真正邦交的正常化。纲领还主张在日本“进行和平革命，实现社会主义社会”。
    大会选出了社会党的领导干部。左派社会党主席铃木茂三郎任社会党主席，右派社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎任社会党总书记。新的中央执行委员会由两派社会党各二十人组成。
    两派社会党合并后，已经成为日本国会中最大的反对党。在众议院全部四百六十七个议席中，社会党占一百五十五席；在参议院全部二百五十个议席中，社会党占七十席。
