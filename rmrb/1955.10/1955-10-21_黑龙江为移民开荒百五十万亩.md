Heilongjiang Province has completed the task of reclaiming 1.5 million mu of land for immigrants. Since the land reclamation began in early August, the broad masses of farmers have displayed their socialist labor enthusiasm, proposing to keep the plows working even when people and horses rest, starting early, and working late into the night to rush the work. Tractor stations and mechanized farms generally implemented two or three shifts, working day and night. Statistics up to October 5 show that the province has victoriously completed the task of reclaiming 1.5 million mu for immigrants. Among them, Anda, Nenjiang, Longjiang, Yian and other ten counties have overfulfilled their tasks. Nenjiang and Anda counties alone exceeded the target by more than 2,500 mu. According to the current situation, it is estimated that another 200,000 mu or so can be reclaimed before the ground freezes. The quality of the reclaimed wasteland is basically good. Machine耕 (machine plowing) reclamation generally adopted one plowing and three harrowing or four harrowing operations, with a depth of 18-22 centimeters, achieving the required standards of combining plowing and harrowing, and making the harrowing fine, even, and thorough. Animal power reclamation mostly combined plowing and harrowing, with a depth of about 13 centimeters. (Ma Qingtan)

    黑龙江为移民开荒百五十万亩
    黑龙江省已完成为移民开荒一百五十万市亩的任务。从八月初开始垦荒以来，广大农民发挥了建设社会主义的劳动热情，提出歇人歇马不歇犁，起大早，贪大黑突击作业。各拖拉机站和机械农场普遍实行二班或三班，昼夜不停，截止十月五日统计，全省为移民开荒一百五十万市亩任务已胜利完成，其中安达、嫩江、龙江、依安等十个县都超额完成任务，仅嫩江、安达两县即超过二千五百多市亩。从目前情况估计，在结冻前还可争取多开二十万市亩左右。开出的荒地，质量基本良好，机耕开荒均采取一翻三耙或四耙，深度达十八——二十二公分，做到了翻耙结合，耙地细、平、透的要求标准，畜力开荒多数做到翻耙结合，深度均在十三公分左右。　（马清潭）
