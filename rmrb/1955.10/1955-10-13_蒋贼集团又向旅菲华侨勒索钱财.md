Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 12th: The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's personnel in the Philippines are using the pretext of "celebrating" the birthday of the traitor Chiang and the so-called "Overseas Chinese Day" to push forward a so-called "military support donation campaign" to blackmail and extort money from the Philippine Overseas Chinese. This extortion "campaign" started in early October and will continue until the end of the month.

Before this, the personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in the Philippines had used the guise of so-called "disaster relief" to extort money from the Philippine Overseas Chinese. Five hundred Philippine Overseas Chinese youths who were lured by the Chiang Kai-shek clique to Taiwan for "military support" and military training were also extorted of much money and valuables.

    蒋贼集团又向旅菲华侨勒索钱财
    新华社十二日讯　马尼拉消息：蒋介石卖国集团在菲律宾的人员，正以“庆祝”蒋贼生日和所谓“华侨节”为借口，在菲律宾华侨中推行所谓“劳军捐款运动”来敲诈勒索。这个勒索“运动”从十月初开始，将延至月底才结束。
    在这以前，蒋介石卖国集团在菲律宾的人员曾以所谓“救灾”为幌子，向菲律宾华侨进行勒索。被蒋贼集团诱骗到台湾去“劳军”和受军事训练的五百名菲律宾华侨青年也被勒索去许多金钱和贵重物品。
