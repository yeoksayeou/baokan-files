Comrade Deputy Chairman, dear comrades, friends!

    First, please allow me to extend my warmest welcome to all the guests attending today's reception celebrating the sixth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.

    The German Democratic Republic is the first worker-peasant state and the first truly peace-loving and democratic state in German history. Its establishment marks a turning point in European history. It has achieved a series of significant accomplishments in the six years since its founding. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, our working people are working with unparalleled enthusiasm to build socialism. The achievements of the German Democratic Republic in politics, economics, and culture are attributable, on the one hand, to the invincible strength of our working class and the unremitting efforts of the working people. On the other hand, the generous and selfless assistance from the powerful Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies, which liberated our country from the shackles of Hitler fascism, is also a decisive factor in achieving these accomplishments.

    Therefore, all peace-loving and genuinely patriotic people in Germany have a deep sense of gratitude and responsibility, first and foremost, to the Soviet Union, which supports the German people and always safeguards their interests. The treaty of relations between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union opened a new stage in the development of relations between our two peoples. This treaty is based on equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. This treaty benefits the German people and the Soviet people, benefits the people of other European countries, helps maintain and consolidate peace and security in Europe, and helps restore Germany to a peaceful and democratic country.

    Restoring Germany's unity has always been the primary task facing the German people, and it is primarily a matter for the Germans themselves. Therefore, on the one hand, we regard October 7th as a day to rejoice in the great achievements of the German Democratic Republic in domestic and foreign affairs, and on the other hand, we also celebrate it as a day to be proud of the great construction achievements and results of the working people and to express patriotic responsibility for the fate of the indivisible German Democratic Republic.

    As we celebrate this day, we extend fraternal feelings to the Chinese people, who celebrated the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1st. Since the founding of our country, our two countries' fraternal cooperation and mutual support in political, economic, and cultural fields have become increasingly close and extensive. The joint communiqué of the talks between the premiers of our two countries in July 1954 and the order of Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, on ending the state of war between China and Germany, are important milestones in demonstrating the development of this relationship. The German people have received full support from the People's Republic of China in their just struggle to safeguard their national interests. The Chinese people have received full sympathy and support from the German people in their struggle to build socialism, strive to realize their just demands, and defend peace. The German working people are excited and equally rejoice and are proud of the great achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of their long-tested Communist Party and their great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China. We would like to wish the Chinese people continued brilliant achievements in building socialism and completing their national tasks.

    We deeply feel the great trust and fraternal friendship of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies towards us, and we also recognize our responsibility. Therefore, we will more resolutely and effectively carry out the struggle for the peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany, against the Paris Accords and the revival of West German militarism, thereby contributing to the maintenance and guarantee of European peace and world peace.

    Long live the legitimate German state, the fortress of democracy, unity, and progress – the German Democratic Republic!

    Long live the powerful People's Republic of China and the unbreakable friendship between our two peoples!

    Long live the great leader of the world peace camp, the loyal friend of our two peoples – the powerful Soviet Union!

    Long live the invincible peace camp and world peace!

### 葛鲁特纳代办的讲话

    葛鲁特纳代办的讲话敬爱的副主席同志，亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    请允许我首先向所有出席今天庆祝德意志民主共和国成立六周年招待会的来宾表示最热烈的欢迎。
    德意志民主共和国是德国历史上第一个工农国家、第一个真正爱好和平和民主的国家。它的成立意味着欧洲历史的转折点。它在成立以来的六年中获得了一系列重大的成就。我国劳动人民正在德国统一社会党的领导下以无比的热情为建设社会主义而工作。德意志民主共和国在政治、经济和文化方面获得的成就，一方面应归功于我国工人阶级的无敌力量和劳动人民不懈的努力。另一方面，把我国从希特勒法西斯枷锁下解放出来的强大苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家所给予的慷慨无私的援助，也是取得这些成就的决定性条件。
    因此，德国所有爱好和平的和真正爱国的人们，首先是对支持德国人民并始终维护他们利益的苏联怀着深厚的感激心情和责任感。德意志民主共和国和苏联关系条约开始了我们两国人民关系发展的新阶段。这个条约是建立在平等、互相尊重主权和互不干涉内政的基础上的。这个条约有利于德国人民和苏联人民，有利于欧洲其他各国人民，并有助于维护和巩固欧洲的和平和安全以及有助于把德国恢复成为和平民主的国家。
    恢复德国的统一始终是摆在德国人民面前的首要任务，它首先是德国人自己的事情。因此，我们一方面把十月七日当作是对德意志民主共和国在内政外交方面的巨大成就感到欢欣鼓舞的日子，另外一方面也把它当作是对劳动人民的巨大建设成就和成果感到自豪和对不可分割的德意志民主共和国的命运表示爱国责任感的日子来庆祝。
    我们在庆祝这一天时，对在十月一日庆祝中华人民共和国成立六周年的中国人民怀着兄弟般的感情。自从建国以来，我们两国在政治、经济和文化方面的兄弟般的合作和相互支援已越来越密切和越开展了。一九五四年七月我们两国总理的会谈联合公报和中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志关于结束中德之间战争状态的命令，是表明这种关系的发展的重要里程碑。德国人民在维护自己民族利益的正义斗争中获得中华人民共和国充分支持。中国人民在建设社会主义和争取实现他们正义的要求和保卫和平的斗争中获得德国人民的充分同情和支持。德国劳动人民怀着兴奋的心情，对中国人民在其久经考验的共产党和他们伟大领袖、中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志领导下所获得的巨大成就同样感到欢欣鼓舞和骄傲。我们谨祝中国人民在建设社会主义和完成他们的民族任务方面继续获得光辉成就。
    我们深深地体会到苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家对我们的巨大信任和兄弟般的友谊，我们也同样认识到我们的责任，因此更坚决更有效地进行争取和平和民主地重建德国的统一、反对巴黎协定和西德军国主义复活的斗争，从而为维护和保障欧洲和平与世界和平作出贡献。
    合法的德意志国家、民主、统一和进步的堡垒——德意志民主共和国万岁！
    强大的中华人民共和国以及我们两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    世界和平阵营的伟大领袖、我们两国人民忠实朋友——强大的苏联万岁！
    不可战胜的和平阵营与世界和平万岁！
