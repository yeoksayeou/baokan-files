After listening to the reports from the youth activists, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of youth in various regions for building socialism has become even higher.

Chen Guangjin, a worker at the Wuchang Rolling Stock Plant in Hubei, said after listening to the report: "The exemplary deeds of the youth activists have deeply moved me and strengthened our determination and confidence in realizing socialism." Liu Kunjie, a first-class model for flood prevention in Wuhan, representing the eight youth shock brigades participating in water conservancy projects, guaranteed to persist in the unremitting struggle to consolidate the dikes and protect Wuhan from flood damage. After putting forward a guarantee to eliminate accidents and increase production, all the young members of the youth supervision post of the No. 5 Power Plant of the Wuhan Metallurgical and Electrical Industry Bureau shortened the number of steam turbine inspections upon returning to the factory. Yue Zhongzhi, the young director of the Weimin Vegetable Production Cooperative in Tangshan District, Nanchang City, after listening to the report, proposed to respond to the three initiatives of launching the "thousands of carts and tens of thousands of dan" manure accumulation movement, the "three kinds" movement, and "suggesting that rural educated youth across the country actively participate in the work of eliminating illiteracy."
