    Congratulating the Sixth Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
    Dalai Lama Sends a Respectful Telegram to Chairman Mao
    To the great Chairman Mao Zedong:
    At this time when people of all ethnic groups across the country are warmly celebrating the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Tibet region is also holding grand celebrations. I would like to express my highest respect to you on behalf of the monks and laypeople of Tibet. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and your great leadership, the victory of the people's revolution has been achieved in a short period. All ethnic groups in China are united and have embarked on the road to happiness, and Tibet has also been peacefully liberated. The People's Liberation Army and staff entering Tibet are sincerely and correctly implementing your ethnic policies, and unprecedented unity has emerged among our fraternal ethnic groups. In order to develop Tibet's political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings, they are providing us with immeasurable assistance. According to the decision on the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region passed at the seventh meeting of the State Council this year, preparatory work has now begun. This is a major event with far-reaching benefits for the current and permanent interests of the Tibetan people, and it is only thanks to the grace of your great leader that we can obtain it. The Tibet local government, the Panchen Kanpo Lija, and the Changdu Area People's Liberation Committee will unite and support the socialist construction of the motherland together with the people of the whole country, thoroughly implement all approved resolutions concerning Tibet, and strive to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet.
    Presented by the Dalai Lama, Tibet Local Government
