The "Locomotive" team achieved excellent results at the First National Workers' Games. In the track and field competition, the "Locomotive" team won first place in both the men's and women's team total scores. In ball games, the "Locomotive" team won the women's volleyball championship and the second place in men's basketball, men's volleyball, and football. Thirty-one of the forty male and female athletes who participated in the track and field competition were ranked, winning first place in fifteen events and second place in ten events, receiving fifty-five gold and silver medals. Excellent athletes Li Zhonglin and Fu Shenghai also broke the national records for the men's 800 meters and 5,000 meters, respectively.

The "Locomotive" team has one hundred and eighteen athletes, selected from the "National Railway Correspondence Games" held from May to August this year. The more than 7,400 athletes who participated in the correspondence games were selected from grassroots sports meets involving more than 140,000 employees. Among the one hundred and eighteen athletes, there are locomotive drivers, stokers, distribution workers, fitters, electricians, loaders, handlers, telephone operators, engineering and technical personnel, trade union workers, political workers, and medical workers. Party members and Youth League members account for 53 percent. Many athletes are also models and advanced workers in production and work. For example, Wang Tingyi, who won second place in the men's 400-meter hurdles, is a demobilized and transferred soldier who received two first-class merit awards and a collective merit award in the army. Zhang Suying, who won second place in the women's 100 meters and fourth place in the 200 meters, was repeatedly awarded the title of advanced worker in the Qiqihar Railway Bureau and is also an advanced worker in Qiqihar City. Li Zhi, who won first place in both the women's 400 meters and 800 meters, received a major merit award in the army in the past. Li Zhonglin, who won first place in both the men's 400 meters and 800 meters, has been rewarded twice by the Ministry of Railways. Li Fenglan, the captain of the women's volleyball team, received two merit awards and was awarded the title of model League member when she worked as a plate dismantler in the printing factory of the Harbin Railway Bureau.

The athletes of the "Locomotive" team not only have excellent results but also have good performance in sportsmanship and style. In the semi-final of the women's 80-meter hurdles at this conference, Huoxing team member Liu Jinrong hit a hurdle and fell on Cui Ailin, a "Locomotive" team member in the adjacent lane, and both fell to the ground. After Cui Ailin got up, she did not rush forward immediately but helped Liu Jinrong up before trying to run to the finish line. However, the first three runners were further ahead, and although Cui Ailin was fast, she only finished fourth. As soon as she came down after running to the finish line, Cui Ailin went to find Liu Jinrong, held her hand tightly, and asked her if she was injured. Afterwards, with the consent of the chief referee, Cui Ailin was allowed to participate in the final. As a result, she won first place in the women's 80-meter hurdles final on the 6th with a time of 14.8 seconds.

The "Locomotive" team's ability to achieve such excellent results is inseparable from the widespread development of mass sports activities among railway workers. The China "Locomotive" Sports Association and more than 1,400 "Locomotive" sports associations at all levels have actively and proactively led and organized sports activities for railway workers since their establishment. They use various methods such as movies, propaganda trains, seminars, reports, and exhibitions to publicize the purpose, significance, and role of sports and inspire the majority of workers to participate in physical exercise. At the same time, they educate athletes on the new sports style. They also regularly hold sports meets and various competitions to promote mass sports activities. In 1954 alone, grassroots sports associations held 1,980 sports meets, with more than 245,000 athletes participating. Sports associations at all levels have also vigorously cultivated amateur sports workers. From 1953 to 1954 alone, they trained more than 9,800 people, who have become the backbone force in promoting sports activities in grassroots units.

Now, the sports movement of railway workers has basically moved towards mass participation and regularity. The most widespread activity is calisthenics. According to statistics in 1954, a total of more than 378,000 railway workers participated. Ball games have also developed rapidly. According to statistics from twenty districts at the end of 1954, there were 5,856 basketball teams, 2,744 volleyball teams, and 280 football teams, with approximately 87,200 people participating. These team numbers and numbers of people only represent the representative teams when units compete with other units. The number of people participating in ball games in grassroots units is much larger. In addition, activities such as skating, swimming, and skiing have also been initially developed, and many employees have also joined the "Labor and Defense System" training groups. With the development of mass sports activities, the sports level of workers has also been continuously improved, and athletes are creating new achievements every day. At this year's National Railway Correspondence Games, ninety-two people broke the all-railway record in six men's and women's cycling events, and forty-one people broke the all-railway record in nine track and field events. Among them, Shen Bingqing, a female athlete from the Harbin Railway Bureau, also broke the national record for the women's 5,000-meter cycling.

Railway leaders at all levels also attach great importance to carrying out mass sports activities for workers. Teng Daiyuan, Minister of Railways and President of the China "Locomotive" Sports Association, and Lu Zhengcao and Liu Jianzhang, Vice Ministers of Railways, not only support the various activities of the "Locomotive" Sports Association but also regularly convene负责人responsible persons of the sports association to listen to work reports and give specific instructions. Before the official opening of the First National Workers' Games, Teng Daiyuan and other comrades also convened a forum with the athletes of the "Locomotive" team, instructing the athletes to "not be arrogant in victory, but continue to consolidate the victory and expand the results; do not be discouraged in defeat, but fight tenaciously and turn defeat into victory." The athletes of the "Locomotive" team participated in the conference competition following this instruction.

The First National Workers' Games has successfully concluded, and the athletes of the "Locomotive" team will return to their work posts, where they will lead more railway workers to participate in sports activities, enhance the physical fitness of workers, and serve socialist construction.

    获得田径赛团体总分第一的火车头代表队
    赵基
    在全国第一届工人体育运动大会上，火车头代表队获得了优异的成绩。在田径赛中，男子和女子的团体总分，火车头代表队都是第一名。在球类比赛中，火车头代表队获得了女子排球的冠军和男子篮球、男子排球、足球的亚军。参加田径比赛的四十个男女运动员中有三十一个人取上了名，共获得十五项比赛的第一名和十项比赛的第二名，得了金质奖章和银质奖章五十五枚。优秀的运动员李中林、傅生海还分别打破了男子八百公尺和五千公尺的全国最高纪录。
    火车头代表队有一百十八名运动员，是今年五月到八月“全国铁路通讯运动大会”中选拔出来的。参加通讯运动大会的七千四百多运动员则又是从有十四万多名职工参加的基层运动会选拔出来的。一百十八名运动员中有机车司机、司炉，有配电工、钳工、电工、装卸工、搬运员、电话员，有工程技术人员有工会工作者、政治工作者和医务工作者，党员和青年团员占百分之五十三。很多运动员还是生产上、工作上的模范和先进工作者，例如这次获得男子四百公尺中栏第二名的王廷义是复员转业军人，在部队时曾立过两次一等功，还立过集体功。获得女子一百公尺第二名和二百公尺第四名的张素英在齐齐哈尔铁路管理局曾连获先进工作者的称号，又是齐齐哈尔市的先进工作者。获得女子四百公尺和八百公尺两项第一的李志，过去在部队中曾立过一次大功。获得男子四百公尺和八百公尺两项第一的李中林曾受到铁道部的两次奖励。女子排球队队长李凤兰在哈尔滨铁路管理局印刷厂当拆版工时立过两次功，并获得模范团员称号。
    火车头代表队的运动员不仅成绩优异，在体育道德、作风方面也有良好的表现。在这次大会的女子八十公尺低栏复赛中，火星队员刘金容撞栏摔倒在邻近跑道上的火车头队员崔爱麟的身上，两人同时倒在地上。崔爱麟爬起之后，没有立即往前赶，还拉了刘金容一把，然后努力向终点跑去。但是，前三人跑得更远了，崔爱麟速度虽快，却只落得个第四名，跑到终点刚刚下来，崔爱麟马上去找刘金容，紧握着刘金容的手，关心地问她受伤了没有？事后，经总裁判长的同意，准予崔爱麟参加决赛。结果，她在六日女子八十公尺低栏决赛中，用十四秒八的成绩取得了第一名。
    火车头代表队能够获得这样优异的成绩，是同铁路职工广泛地开展了群众性的体育活动分不开的。中国火车头体育协会和一千四百多个各级火车头体育协会从成立时起，就积极主动地领导和组织铁路职工的体育活动，通过电影、宣传列车、座谈会、报告会、展览会等多种多样的方式，宣传体育运动的目的、意义和作用，启发广大职工参加体育锻炼；同时对运动员进行新的体育作风的教育。他们还经常举办运动会和各种比赛，推动群众性的体育运动，仅一九五四年各基层体育协会就举办了一千九百八十次运动会，有运动员二十四万五千多人参加。各级火车头体育协会还大力培养了业余体育工作者，仅一九五三、一九五四年就培养了九千八百多人，他们已成为推动基层单位体育运动的骨干力量。
    现在铁路职工的体育运动已基本上走向了群众化和经常化。开展得最普遍的是广播体操，据一九五四年统计，全铁路职工共有三十七万八千多人参加。球类活动也开展得较快，据一九五四年底的二十个区的统计，有篮球五千八百五十六个队，排球二千七百四十四个队，足球二百八十个队，约有八万七千二百多人参加。这些队数和人数，还只是各单位同其他单位比赛时的代表队，在基层单位中参加球类活动的人数还要多得多。此外，滑冰、游泳、滑雪等活动也有初步开展，还有许多职工参加了“劳卫制”的锻炼小组。随着群众性体育运动的开展，职工的运动水平也不断提高，运动员们每天都创造新的成绩。今年全路通讯运动大会上，就有九十二人打破了六项男、女自行车比赛的全铁路最高纪录；四十一人打破了九项田径赛的全铁路最高纪录。其中哈尔滨铁路管理局的女运动员沈冰清还打破了女子五千公尺自行车的全国最高纪录。
    铁路各级领导方面也非常重视开展群众性的职工体育运动。铁道部部长兼中国火车头体育协会会长滕代远、铁道部副部长吕正操、刘建章等领导同志，不仅支持火车头体育协会的各项活动，而且经常召集体育协会负责人听取工作汇报并作具体指示。在全国第一届职工体育运动大会正式开幕前，滕代远等同志还召集了火车头代表队的运动员开座谈会，指示运动员们要“胜不骄，而是继续巩固胜利，扩大战果；败不馁，而要顽强地战斗，转败为胜。”火车头代表队的运动员们正是遵循着这一指示参加大会比赛的。
    全国第一届工人体育运动大会已经胜利闭幕了，火车头代表队的运动员们就要回到本单位的工作岗位上，他们将带动更多的铁路职工参加体育运动，增强职工体质，为社会主义建设服务。
