    钱学森等回到广州
    新华社广州九日电　从美国归来的著名的中国科学家钱学森和物理学家李整武在八日晚到达广州。中国科学院华南植物研究所所长陈焕镛、广东省人民委员会办公厅副主任郑天保、中山大学校长许崇清、华南工学院院长罗明燏、华南医学院副院长梁伯强等到车站欢迎。中国科学院曾派代表到深圳迎接。
    钱学森在一九三五年去美国研究航空工程和空气动力学，得到加利福尼亚工学院博士学位，曾历任这个学校的讲师、副教授、教授及超音速实验室主任等职务，一九四九年起，他是这个学校“古根罕喷气推进研究中心”的负责人。一九五零年钱学森离美返国时，曾被美国当局留难并非法逮捕，并拘禁了十五天以后才给予释放。但此后钱学森便一直被禁止离开美国。当钱学森在今年九月十七日和他夫人以及物理学家李整武博士夫妇等乘“克利夫兰总统号”邮船离开洛杉矶回国时，美国移民局和联邦调查局曾搜查了他的行李和监视着他的离开。
    钱学森博士和李整武博士等到达广州后，游览了广州的名胜古迹，参观了苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会。当晚并应邀出席了中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会广州分会的宴会。（附图片）
