    Hubei Undertakes Drainage Project in Marshland Area
    A large-scale drainage project is underway in the marshland area from Changhu Lake in Jingmen County to Honghu Lake in Honghu County, Hubei Province. This project includes the construction of a reservoir, more than ten water control gates, flood discharge gates, and ship locks, as well as the excavation of irrigation canals totaling over 300 kilometers in length and a canal approximately 30 kilometers long. The total earthwork volume is over 70 million cubic meters, equivalent to the total earthwork volume for dyke maintenance after the major flood in Hubei Province last year. The excavation of the East Main Canal will be completed first this winter and next spring, with an estimated earthwork volume of 10 million cubic meters. Surveying and alignment work is currently underway.

    Once the entire project is completed, this grain and cotton-rich area will be able to avoid waterlogging disasters caused by mountain floods and backflow from the Yangtze River in normal years. It is estimated that the irrigated area can be improved by more than one million mu; and more than one million mu of land will be restored and reclaimed into fertile fields due to the elimination of perennial waterlogging. After the East Main Canal is excavated, more than 300,000 mu of land can be reclaimed. (Yuan Jun)

    湖北兴修湖沼地区排水工程
    湖北省从荆门县长湖到洪湖县洪湖的湖沼地区，正在开始兴修一项规模宏大的排水工程。这项工程包括建立水库一座，节制闸、泄洪闸和船闸一共十多个，以及开凿总长三百多公里的灌溉干渠和一条长三十公里左右的运河。全部工程仅土方就有七千多万立方公尺，相当于湖北省去年大水以后堤防岁修的土方总和，今冬明春将首先完成东干渠的开凿任务，预计土方一千万立方公尺，目前正在进行勘测定线工作。
    全部工程建成以后，这个富产粮棉的地区将能免除一般年份内的山洪和江水倒灌造成的渍水灾害。预计可以改善灌溉面积一百多万亩；并将有一百多万亩土地因为排除了常年渍水而恢复和开垦成为良田，仅东干渠凿成以后，就有三十多万亩土地可以开垦出来。　（袁军）
