An Important Contribution to Promoting a Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue

On September 29th, the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers announced that the Chinese People's Volunteers would once again withdraw six divisions from Korea and return to the motherland. Now, these troops have begun to cross the Yalu River and return to the motherland. The people of the whole country are happily welcoming their relatives and expressing their cordial greetings to them.

When the aggressors in the Korean War pushed to the Yalu River and the security of the motherland was seriously threatened, the Chinese People's Volunteers, entrusted by the Chinese people, undertook the important task of resisting America and aiding Korea. It was an armed force defending peace. It excellently completed its task, coordinating with the Korean People's Army to repel the aggressors, defend the motherland, and defend peace. It also made its due contribution to the recovery work of the Korean people in healing the wounds of war. The Chinese people express their sincere respect for their achievements.

Since the Chinese people's resistance to America and aid to Korea was for the sake of defending peace, when the Korean armistice negotiations began in July 1951, the Korean and Chinese sides proposed the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea. After the Korean armistice, in order to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, China has repeatedly proposed the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, under various circumstances and through various channels. Although this proposal has been obstructed and has not been realized, the Chinese people have taken the initiative to withdraw three batches of troops from Korea one after another. Up to now, the Chinese People's Volunteers have withdrawn nineteen divisions from Korea. The people of the world can see here that the successive withdrawals of their troops from Korea by the Chinese People's Volunteers is a clear manifestation of the consistent sincerity of the Chinese people in striving for further relaxation of the Far East situation and seeking a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Our government and people have always advocated that the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully. Only by withdrawing all foreign troops, including the American troops and the Chinese People's Volunteers, can the people of North and South Korea freely express their will without foreign interference and establish their national unity on the basis of truly free elections. This proposition of the Chinese people is in line with the national interests of the entire Korean people and the interests of peace in the Far East, and is the most correct path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This proposition is also completely consistent with the propositions of the government and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The continued withdrawal of six divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea and their return to the motherland is once again an irrefutable proof of the sincere efforts of the Chinese people to realize these propositions, and it is undoubtedly another important contribution to promoting the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Obviously, the Korean issue has not been resolved peacefully for more than two years since the Korean armistice, and the unification of Korea has not been realized to this day. The responsibility does not lie with the Korean and Chinese sides, but with the South Korean authorities and their supporters. For more than two years since the armistice, the South Korean authorities have been hostile to the Korean armistice, openly clamoring to tear up the armistice agreement, drive away the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and resume the Korean War. According to the Associated Press, on October 8, the South Korean Congress was again clamoring to "dissolve the Korean Armistice Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and abolish the armistice agreement," and could only "hold elections in North Korea under the supervision of the United Nations." The activities of the Syngman Rhee clique to maintain the tense situation in Korea in order to achieve their destructive goals are entirely due to reliance on American military support. It constantly threatens the Korean armistice and causes many difficulties in maintaining peace in the Far East. This situation is enough to show how urgent the need is to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

The United States, which once represented the United Nations forces in signing the armistice agreement, has an unshirkable responsibility for maintaining the Korean armistice agreement and ensuring a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, the facts prove that those groups in the United States who are unwilling to see the situation ease not only do not stop the actions of the Syngman Rhee clique that have consistently threatened peace in Korea, but also often sing in unison and encourage the Syngman Rhee clique to destroy the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, destroy the armistice agreement, and threaten peace in Korea. Just take the facts of the past few days as an example. On the same day that the South Korean Congress clamored that elections could only be "held in North Korea under the supervision of the United Nations," "senior officials" in Washington issued statements opposing "any free elections" in Korea, hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea, and coordinating with it.

American senior officials deliberately repeated the proposition that everyone knows is unreasonable and unacceptable: that the United Nations should preside over and supervise elections in Korea. They further insisted on refusing to withdraw American troops from Korea, and unilaterally demanded that "all communist troops" must withdraw. It seems that after the Geneva Four-Power Summit, the United States still does not know what the Geneva spirit is. After suffering many lessons, it seems that it has not yet woken up, and still thinks that the United States can impose the will of one side of the Korean armistice on the other.

People can understand that these far from accidental lively activities of the United States and South Korea are not without reason just as the United Nations General Assembly is preparing to discuss certain issues related to Korea. The United States not only refuses to withdraw American troops from South Korea, but also continues to strengthen Syngman Rhee's military strength, and is again clamoring to "rely on atomic weapons" in South Korea. These tense activities are clearly intended to influence the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly. However, these activities also inevitably deepen the world's people's understanding that the United States is still unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and still wants to maintain South Korea as an American military base.

The Chinese People's Volunteers continue to voluntarily withdraw troops from Korea, and our government and people have consistently sought a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in order to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea. This is in sharp contrast to the attempts of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique to undermine the Korean armistice and continue to divide Korea in every possible way. All those who sincerely seek the peaceful reunification of Korea and are willing to ease the situation in the Far East sympathize with us. The "Indian Express" said on October 3, commenting on the withdrawal of six divisions of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, that this action "completely conforms to the new atmosphere in international affairs" and that "Beijing maintains the Geneva spirit." The policy of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue is increasingly criticized by all parties. Even some countries that once participated in the war on the American side in Korea cannot fully agree with the policy pursued by the United States in Korea that is not conducive to the peaceful reunification of Korea.

The current international situation has begun to ease due to the positive impact brought by the Geneva Four-Power Summit. This has opened up broad prospects for negotiated solutions to all international disputes. The Korean issue should not be an exception here. If the countries concerned have the sincerity to solve the problem and adopt a spirit of cooperation, then withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea and further seeking the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea is entirely possible. Our government has pointed out more than once that we support the suggestion of holding a Far East conference with the broad participation of Asian countries to discuss the peaceful reunification of Korea. We believe that this is an effective and realistic path.

### 促进和平解决朝鲜问题的重要贡献

    促进和平解决朝鲜问题的重要贡献
    中国人民志愿军总部九月二十九日宣布，中国人民志愿军再一次从朝鲜撤出六个师返回祖国。现在，这些部队已经开始渡过鸭绿江回到祖国来了。全国人民欢欣迎接自己的亲人归来，并向他们表示亲切的慰问。
    在朝鲜战争中的侵略者打到鸭绿江边、祖国的安全受到严重威胁的时候，中国人民志愿军受到中国人民的委托，担当了抗美援朝的重大任务。它是一支保卫和平的武装力量。它卓越地完成了它的任务，协同朝鲜人民军击退了侵略者，保卫了祖国、保卫了和平。它并且在朝鲜人民医治战争创伤的恢复工作中，作了应有的贡献。中国人民对他们的功勋表示真诚的敬意。
    由于中国人民抗美援朝是为了保卫和平，因此，一九五一年七月，当朝鲜停战谈判开始的时候，朝中方面就提出从朝鲜撤走一切外国军队的问题。朝鲜停战以后，中国为了谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，曾经在各种情况中，经过各种途径，一次又一次地提出了从朝鲜撤走一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内的主张。虽然这种提议受到了阻挠没有实现，但是，中国人民已经主动从朝鲜先后撤回了三批部队。迄今为止，中国人民志愿军已经从朝鲜撤出了十九个师。世界人民在这里可以看到，中国人民志愿军接二连三地从朝鲜撤出自己的部队，是中国人民争取远东局势的进一步缓和，并谋求朝鲜问题和平解决的一贯诚意的鲜明表现。
    我国政府和人民一向主张朝鲜问题应当和平解决。只有撤出一切外国军队，包括美国军队和中国人民志愿军在内，在没有外国干涉的情况下，南北朝鲜人民才能够自由地表达他们的意志，在真正自由选举的基础上建立起他们的国家统一。中国人民的这个主张，符合全体朝鲜人民的民族利益，符合于远东和平的利益，是和平解决朝鲜问题的最正确的道路。这个主张并且是同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和人民的主张完全一致的。中国人民志愿军这次继续从朝鲜撤出六个师返回祖国，再一次无可辩驳地证明中国人民实现这些主张的真诚努力，它无疑地是对促进朝鲜问题和平解决的又一个重要贡献。
    很明显，朝鲜停战两年多来，朝鲜问题没有能够和平解决，朝鲜的统一至今不能实现，责任不是在朝中方面，而是在南朝鲜当局和它的支持者方面。停战两年多来，南朝鲜当局一直敌视朝鲜停战，公开叫嚷要撕毁停战协定，赶走中立国监察委员会，恢复朝鲜的战争。据合众社报道，十月八日南朝鲜国会又在叫嚷要“解散朝鲜停战中立国监察委员会并且废除停战协定”，只能“在朝鲜北部由联合国监督举行选举”。李承晚集团为了保持朝鲜紧张局势以达到他们的破坏目的的活动，完全是因为倚靠着美国的军事支持。它使朝鲜停战经常受到威胁，使远东和平的保持遭受许多困难。这种情况足以说明：从朝鲜撤走一切外国军队，和平解决朝鲜问题是怎样迫切的需要。
    曾经代表联合国军在停战协定上签字的美国，对于维护朝鲜停战协定，保证朝鲜问题和平解决负有不可推卸的责任。可是，事实证明，美国那些不愿局势缓和的集团，不但不制止李承晚集团一贯威胁朝鲜和平的行动，而且经常一唱一和，鼓励李承晚集团破坏中立国监察委员会、破坏停战协定、威胁朝鲜和平的行动。就以最近几天的事实来说，在南朝鲜国会叫嚣只能“在朝鲜北部由联合国监督举行选举”的同一天，华盛顿的“高级官员”就发表反对在朝鲜实行“任何自由选举”，阻挠朝鲜和平统一的谈话，与之配合。
    美国高级官员们有意重复人人都知其不合理、不能被接受的主张：要由联合国主持和监督朝鲜的选举。他们更坚持拒绝从朝鲜撤走美国军队，而片面地要求“全部共产党部队”必须撤走。似乎在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议之后，美国还不知道日内瓦精神是什么东西。它在受过了多次教训之后似乎还没醒悟，还以为美国可以把朝鲜停战一方的意志强加于另一方。
    人们可以理解，正当联合国大会准备讨论某些有关朝鲜的问题的时候，美国和南朝鲜的这些远非意外的热闹活动不是出于无因。美国不但拒绝从南朝鲜撤出美国军队，而且还在继续加强李承晚的军事力量，并且又在叫嚷在南朝鲜“指靠原子武器”。这些紧张活动显然是想影响联合国大会的进程。但是，这些活动同时也不可避免地加深世界人民这样的了解：美国仍然不愿和平解决朝鲜问题，仍然想把南朝鲜保持为美国的军事基地。
    中国人民志愿军继续主动地从朝鲜撤出部队，我国政府和人民一贯谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，以促进朝鲜的和平统一，同美国和李承晚集团千方百计企图破坏朝鲜停战，继续分裂朝鲜的做法，是一个强烈的对照。一切真诚谋求朝鲜和平统一和愿意和缓远东局势的人，都是同情我们的。“印度快报”十月三日在评论中国人民志愿军六个师从朝鲜撤出返国时便说，这个行动“完全符合国际事务中的新气氛”，“北京维持着日内瓦精神”。美国和李承晚集团阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的政策，则越来越多地受到各方的责难，就是有些曾经参加美国方面在朝鲜作战的国家，也不能完全同意美国在朝鲜所奉行的不利于朝鲜和平统一的政策。
    目前国际局势，已因四国政府首脑日内瓦会议带来的积极影响，而开始有了和缓。这为协商解决一切国际争端开辟了广阔的前景。朝鲜问题在这里不应该是例外。如果各有关国家具有解决问题的诚意，采取合作的精神，那么，从朝鲜撤走一切外国军队，进一步谋求朝鲜和平统一的实现，是完全可以作得到的。我国政府不止一次指出，我国支持有关国家举行一次有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议来讨论和平统一朝鲜问题的建议，我们认为这是一条有效的现实的途径。
