Ideological Work in the Establishment of Agricultural Cooperatives in Shatang Township, Beiliu County

　　Liang Yaosong, Huang Junguang

Before establishing agricultural cooperatives, Shatang Township in Beiliu County, Guangxi Province, extensively publicized the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives and the Party's specific policies on cooperativization. After the publicity, more than 400 peasant households voluntarily signed up to join the cooperatives. However, due to the rapid progress of the movement and the relatively rough ideological mobilization work, many people, both those who had signed up and those who had not, still had many concerns about joining the cooperatives. Many people joined with impure motives. Among the 162 households in the seven groups that had been determined to switch to cooperatives, 19 households were concerned that production would not increase after joining the cooperatives; 11 households were afraid of hard work and restricted freedom after joining; 20 households joined for the convenience of buying fertilizer and obtaining loans; 12 households mistakenly believed that they could sell less grain after joining; and 36 households joined because they did not understand and were “following the crowd”. Some people wavered after signing up, and the ideological struggle was very intense.

In response to this situation, Shatang Township, in addition to general mobilization calls, focused on carrying out in-depth and meticulous ideological mobilization work to dispel farmers' concerns, correct their misunderstandings about joining the cooperatives, and strengthen their confidence in joining. The ideological mobilization work started from several aspects:

First, calculate and compare accounts. Compare individual farming with mutual aid teams, and mutual aid teams with cooperatives. Through factual comparisons, farmers further recognized the benefits of cooperatives.

Sun Zuzhen of the Shijie Agricultural Production Cooperative, with a family of four and cultivating seven mu of land, signed up when the township called for the establishment of cooperatives. Later, he thought: he had been farming for decades, and life had passed by, so why bother joining the cooperative and being restricted? He was also concerned that there were many poor households in this cooperative and that the foundation was weak. He heard people say that there was no benefit to joining the cooperative and that production could not be increased, so he resolutely refused to join. Five core members of the cooperative went to connect with him one after another, but he still wanted to withdraw. Later, his elder brother, Sun Zuhua, guided him to recall the situation before he joined the mutual aid team in 1953: individual farming meant a lack of manpower, and not much grain could be harvested. His brother and his daughter both died of illness, which further reduced the labor force and made production even worse. He still owed 25 yuan and had not paid it off. His elder brother said to him affectionately: "Zuzhen, I have suffered the same hardships as you from individual farming, and I have suffered the losses of individual farming. I have tasted enough of these hardships. Joining the cooperative will gradually overcome these difficulties. I am advising you to join the cooperative, and I, as your elder brother, would not intentionally deceive you!" He cried when he heard this. At the group meeting that night, he talked about his past difficulties in individual farming and finally stated his position: "I resolutely request to join the cooperative, and my heart is firmer than iron."

At the group discussion meeting, everyone used Chen Jiaping, a member of the Shatang Second Branch, as an example for comparison: his family of four cultivated more than six mu of land. Before 1953, he did not participate in the mutual aid team. Due to the lack of manpower and animal power, production could not keep up with the season, and he only harvested 3,104 jin of rice a year. The family worked hard from morning to night, but life was still not easy. In 1953, he joined the mutual aid team, and the manpower and animal power were solved. Production could also keep up with the season, and he could increase production by more than 600 jin of rice every year. However, the strength of the mutual aid team was ultimately limited, and it could not compare with the agricultural cooperative in terms of increasing production. The First Cooperative (the old cooperative) harvested an average of 244 jin per mu of early rice this year, while the mutual aid team only harvested 233 jin. When the Wangshan Branch was discussing this issue, Chen Erpo, who was 67 years old, also expressed her opinion: "Although joining the mutual aid team has overcome some difficulties, things like watching water and grazing cattle still have to be taken care of by ourselves. There are only me and my 17-year-old daughter in my family. I am really not at ease letting my daughter go to watch water alone in the middle of the night. Joining the cooperative will save me from worrying about this." Later, the Wangshan Old Cooperative, which suffered heavy disasters, was used as a comparison. Although the old cooperative's early rice production decreased this year, the mutual aid team suffered even greater losses in the same disaster-stricken fields. Zhang Yezhen, a member of the mutual aid team, said: "We used to think that if others reduced production, they would collapse. As a result, not only did they not collapse, but they were much stronger than us. Now, four out of the seven households in our group have no rice to eat in August, while all 22 households in the old cooperative still have rice to grind." Through such comparisons, farmers realized that after the land reform, most farmers still had considerable difficulties in production and life. When they suffered serious natural disasters or unexpected accidents, they would inevitably decline, and even go bankrupt. In order to completely get rid of poverty, they must take the socialist road.

Second, deepen farmers' understanding of cooperatives and enhance their socialist enthusiasm through the personal experiences of old cooperative members or visits to old cooperatives. Gan Maoguang, a member of the Pengdong Old Cooperative, used to be a poor household and was short of food every year. He joined the cooperative last year, and in the early rice season this year, he received 2,499 jin (compared to only 1,200 jin last year), and his life has improved. Some people say that August is a famine month, but he recently carried a load of rice to grind, and he still has more than 160 jin of grain stored at home. On the evening of September 22, Gan Maoguang introduced his situation to everyone. Farmer Yi Yuesheng said after listening: "What people are saying is the truth. Even those with a weak foundation can increase production after joining the cooperative." The woman Zhang Yezhen recently went to visit her maiden's family (members of the Xirang Township First Branch) and came back full of energy, spreading the truth everywhere: she had visited her maiden's family in April this year (members of the Xirang Township First Branch). At that time, it was a lean month, and the cooperative's production was not good. Her father looked worried, sighed repeatedly, and regretted joining the cooperative. She also complained that her father had taken the wrong path, and she vowed not to join the cooperative. But this time she went to visit her relatives, the situation was different. Her father was smiling and full of energy, and he forgot to go home for lunch while working in the fields. She tentatively asked if joining the cooperative was good, and her father's answer was beyond her expectations: "The early rice distribution after joining the cooperative, the land dividend alone is more than 1,200 jin. Not counting the labor dividend, it is not much worse than the early spring income in previous years. To tell the truth, joining the cooperative is really good." She saw that there was a load of sweet potato dried food stored at home, and there were still several loads of sweet potatoes that had not been dried. There was no such good year in the past. These many facts powerfully canceled her past oath.

Third, calculate the big picture, find ways, and tap potential to enhance farmers' confidence in running cooperatives. During the ideological mobilization process, ordinary farmers would also have such ideas: they admit that others have benefited, but they doubt that they will not. Therefore, in addition to explaining the Party's policy on agricultural cooperativization, it is also necessary to specifically calculate the favorable conditions and potential strength of the agricultural cooperative that they are about to join or build in terms of production, in order to further dispel their concerns that production cannot be increased after joining the cooperative. For example, when the Wangshan Branch held a meeting of cooperative members, everyone discussed tapping production potential: processing and adding fertilizer, applying 10 jin more of fine fertilizer and 5 loads more of coarse fertilizer per mu than last year, which can increase production by 36 jin per mu, and a total of 3,600 jin of rice can be increased on 100 mu of paddy fields in the entire cooperative; increasing the power of cattle, plowing and harrowing once more, which can increase rice production by 2 jin per mu, a total increase of 200 jin; improving the soil quality of 6 mu, which can increase production by 80 jin per mu, a total increase of 480 jin; removing 8 field ridges, which can increase the area by 0.2 mu, which can increase production by 120 jin. The above four items can increase production by a total of 4,400 jin. By calculating the big picture, finding ways, and tapping potential, some people's concerns in the past that "lean cooperatives" (referring to those with many poor households) cannot increase production were eliminated, and the new cooperative members' confidence in joining the cooperative was further enhanced. Cooperative member Yi Chaotang said: "If we didn't calculate it this way, we wouldn't know that there are so many conditions for increasing production."

In the process of carrying out ideological education work, in addition to widely using various propaganda tools and propaganda teams and using large and small meetings to conduct positive education, special attention was paid to individual connections and visits to old cooperatives, and old cooperative members were mobilized to participate in propaganda activities. Among the old cooperative members, three types of people were mainly selected: First, those who were relatively typical poor households before joining the cooperative; second, those with more labor and less land; and third, those with less labor and more land. Letting these people give their own experiences and conduct propaganda is the most persuasive, and new cooperative members can accept it most easily.

After relatively meticulous ideological education work, many people's concerns and incorrect ideas about joining the cooperative have been initially corrected. According to the inspection, among the 407 cooperative members who have signed up to join the seven groups, 199 have a higher level of awareness, a clear understanding, and resolutely demand to join the cooperative; 208 have a general understanding and voluntarily join the cooperative. As the new cooperative members gradually improve their thinking and increase their confidence in establishing the cooperative, their production enthusiasm has also increased. They are actively carrying out activities such as accumulating fertilizer while preparing to establish the cooperative.

    北流县沙塘乡建社中的思想工作　
　　梁耀松　黄俊广
    广西省北流县沙塘乡在建社前，曾经广泛地宣传了农业生产合作社的优越性和党对合作化的具体政策。宣传后有四百多户农民自动报名要求入社。但是由于运动进展很快，思想发动工作做得比较粗糙，不论已报名入社和未报名入社的，仍有许多人对入社顾虑重重；怀着各种不纯动机入社的人也不少。在已确定转社的七个组一百六十二户中，顾虑建社后不能增产的有十九户；怕入社后做工辛苦、行动受限制的十一户；为了买肥料、贷款方便而入社的二十户；误以为入社后可以少卖粮而入社的十二户；认识不清“随大流”入社的三十六户。有些人在报名之后还动摇不定，思想斗争非常激烈。
    针对这个情况，沙塘乡在普遍的动员号召之外，又着重进行了深入细致的思想发动工作，解除农民顾虑，纠正他们对入社的错误认识，坚定他们入社的信心。思想发动工作从几方面着手：
    一、算账对比。以单干比互助组、互助组比合作社。通过事实比较，使农民进一步认识合作社的好处。
    石界农业生产合作社孙祖珍，全家四人，耕田七亩，在乡里号召建社的时候他报了名。后来他想：自己种了几十年田，日子也过去了，现在何必入社受限制？又顾虑在这个社困难户多，底子薄，听人家说入社没好处，没法增产，于是又表示坚决不入社了。社里的五个骨干先后去串连他，他还是要退出。后来他的大哥孙祖华引导他回忆一九五三年参加互助组以前的情形：单干人手薄，收不了多少谷，他胞兄和他女儿两人又害病死了，从此劳动力更加缺乏，生产更差了，到现在还欠二十五元的债没有还清。他大哥对他亲切地说：“祖珍，我和你同样受过单干的苦，吃过单干的亏，这些苦辣算是尝够了，入了社这些困难就会慢慢得到克服。劝你入社，我做大佬的不会是存心骗你吧！”他听得哭了。当天晚上开小组会，他把他过去单干的困难讲了出来，最后表明态度：“我坚决要求入社，就是铁打的也没有我的心坚。”
    在小组讨论会上，大家拿沙塘二分社社员陈家平做比较的例子：他家四人，耕田六亩多，一九五三年前没有参加互助组，因人畜力缺乏，生产赶不上季节，一年只收三千一百零四斤稻谷，每天从早做到晚，一家人辛苦，日子还不好过。一九五三年参加了互助组，人力畜力算是解决了，生产也能赶上了季节，每年能增产六百多斤稻谷。但互助组的力量终究有限，比不上农业合作社增产多，第一社（老社）今年早稻平均每亩收二百四十四斤，而互助组只收二百三十三斤。旺山分社在讨论这个问题的时候，六十七岁的陈二婆也发表了意见说：“入了互助组虽然克服了一部分困难，可是像看水、放牛这些事也还得自己打理，我家只我和一个十七岁的女儿，半夜三更我真不放心我女儿单独去放水，入了社就用不着我操这份心了。”后来又拿受了重灾的旺山老社作比较，虽然今年老社早稻减了产，但是同样受灾的田，互助组比老社减产还大。互助组组员张业珍说：“以前我们以为人家减产会垮台，结果不但不垮台，还比我们强得多，现在我们组七户有四户到八月就没有稻谷吃，人家老社二十二户还户户有稻谷磨。”经过这样对比，农民认识到：土地改革以后大部分农民在生产和生活上都还有相当困难，受到严重自然灾害或发生意外事故的时候，不免要下降，甚至要破产，为了彻底摆脱贫困，必须走社会主义道路。
    二、通过老社社员的现身说法，或实地去访问老社，加深农民对合作社的认识，提高农民的社会主义积极性。碰垌老社社员甘懋光过去是困难户，年年缺粮，他去年入了社，今年早稻一季就分得了二千四百九十九斤（去年只收一千二百斤），生活好过了。有些人说八月是饥荒，可是他最近还担一担米的谷去磨，家里还有存谷一百六十多斤。九月二十二日晚上甘懋光向大家介绍了自己的情况。农民易悦生听了后说：“人家讲的都是真话，家底薄的入了社也能增产。”妇女张业珍最近去已入社的娘家探亲，回来后劲头十足地到处传播真情：今年四月她去过一次娘家（是西壤乡一分社社员），那时正是荒月，社的生产不大好，她父亲愁眉苦脸，长嗟短叹，后悔不该入社，她也埋怨父亲走错了路，自己还发誓不入社；可是这次去探亲，情况就两样了。父亲嘻笑颜开，精神奕奕，在田里做工也忘了回家吃午饭。她试探地问入社好不好，她父亲的答复竟出她意料之外：“入社后的早稻分配，单土地分红已有一千二百多斤，劳动分红不算，也比往年早春收入不差多少，不说假话，入社确实好。”她看到家里存着一担红薯干，还有几担红薯放着没有晒，往年那有这样年景。这许多事实，有力地把她过去发的誓取消了。
    三、算大账、找门路、挖潜力，增强农民办社信心。在思想发动过程中，一般农民还会产生这样的想法：承认别人得到好处，怀疑自己得不到。因此除了讲清党对农业合作化的政策外，还必须具体算算他将要参加或要建的农业合作社在生产上的有利条件和潜在力量，进一步打消其怕入社不能增产的顾虑。如旺山分社在开社员大会的时候，大家讨论挖生产潜力：加工加肥，每亩比去年加施细肥十斤，粗肥五担，每亩可增产三十六斤，全社水田一百亩共可增产三千六百斤稻谷；增加牛力，多犁一次多耙一次，每亩可增产稻谷二斤，共增产二百斤；改良土质六亩，每亩增产八十斤，共增四百八十斤；铲掉田埂八条，增大面积二分，可增产一百二十斤。以上四项共可增产四千四百斤。通过算大账、找门路、挖潜力，过去一些人认为“瘦社”（指困难户多）不能增产的顾虑就消除了，新社员入社的信心也更为提高了。社员易超棠说：“不这样算，那里知道有这么多条件增产。”
    在进行思想教育工作的过程中，除了广泛运用各种宣传工具和宣传队伍，采用大会、小会进行正面教育外，特别注意了个别串连和到老社访问，发动老社社员参加宣传活动。在老社社员中主要选择三种类型的人：一、入社前是比较典型的困难户；二、劳力多、土地少的；三、劳力少、土地多的。让这些人现身说法进行宣传，说服力最大，新社员最能接受。
    经过了比较细致的思想教育工作，许多人对入社的顾虑和不正确的想法已初步得到纠正。根据检查，七个组已报名入社的四百零七个社员中，觉悟较高、认识清楚、坚决要求入社的有一百九十九人；认识一般、自愿入社的有二百零八人。由于新社员思想逐步提高，建社信心增强，生产情绪也提高了，他们正在一边积极开展积肥等活动，一边准备建社。
