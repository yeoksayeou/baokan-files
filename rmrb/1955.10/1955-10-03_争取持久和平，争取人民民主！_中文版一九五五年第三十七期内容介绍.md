The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1955, No. 37, has been published.

This issue features an editorial titled "For Peace and Security in Europe and the World," commenting on the results of the talks between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany in Moscow. The editorial points out that the positive outcome of this negotiation is a new victory for the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy. The editorial states that the establishment of normal relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany is in the interests of the people of both countries and also in the interests of the people of other countries.

Important articles published in this issue include "The Political Situation and the Tasks of the French Communist Party" by Maurice Thorez, Secretary of the French Communist Party, and "The Brazilian Communist Party's Position in the Presidential Election and Current Tasks" by Luís Carlos Prestes, General Secretary of the Brazilian Communist Party.

Thorez's article analyzes the current domestic and international situation in France. When discussing the atrocities of French colonialists in North Africa, the article points out that Communists must stand at the forefront of mass protest movements, demanding that the ruling group end this crazy policy that can only bring unprecedented disasters to our people and motherland. We stand in solidarity with the just struggle of the people of Algeria and Morocco for the restoration of national independence. We must use all means to actively support the North African working people in France. The article points out that the current situation in France is characterized by the increasing development of the working class's struggle for greatly increased wages, and calls on Communists to pay attention to the opinions and demands of workers, and to pay attention to the issue of unity in trade unions and politics. The article concludes: We must fight to satisfy the workers' economic demands, strive for peace, oppose the French government's repression in North Africa, and strive for the implementation of new policies throughout the country. Prestes's article points out that on October 3rd, Brazil will hold presidential elections. In the current environment in Brazil, the working class, in alliance with other democratic and patriotic forces, can completely elect an honest patriot who can implement a policy of peace and defend national sovereignty to serve as President of Brazil. Therefore, the Brazilian people currently have two urgent and important tasks: one is to isolate and defeat the forces attempting to launch a fascist military coup, and the other is to prevent coup plotters and traitors from being elected president. The main task at present is to unite all forces, groups, and parties that are firmly opposed to plotting coups, defend democratic rights and the constitution, and strive for free elections. This is a broad united front movement, and it has become a new and important factor in the national political life.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版一九五五年第三十七期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第三十七期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“为了欧洲和全世界的和平与安全”为题发表社论，评论苏联和德意志联邦共和国在莫斯科举行的会谈的结果。社论指出，这次谈判的积极结果是苏联和平外交政策的新胜利。社论说，苏联和德意志联邦共和国建立正常的关系是既符合苏德两国人民的利益也符合其他各国人民的利益的。
    本期刊载的重要文章有法国共产党书记马·赛尔文的“政治形势和法国共产党的任务”，巴西共产党总书记路·卡·普列斯特斯的“巴西共产党在总统选举中的立场和当前的任务”等。
    赛尔文的文章分析了目前法国国内外的形势。在谈到法国殖民者在北非的暴行时，文章指出，共产党人必须站在大规模抗议运动的前列，要求统治集团结束这种只能给我国人民和祖国带来空前灾难的疯狂政策。我们声援阿尔及利亚和摩洛哥的人民为了恢复民族独立而进行的正义斗争。我们必须用一切办法来积极声援在法国的北非劳动人民。文章指出，法国国内目前局势的特点是工人阶级争取大大提高工资的斗争的日益发展，并且号召共产党人重视工人的意见和要求，注意工会方面和政治方面的团结问题。文章最后说：我们必须进行斗争，满足工人们的经济要求，争取和平，反对法国政府在北非的高压行动，争取在全国实行新的施政方针。普列斯特斯的文章指出，十月三日，巴西将举行总统选举。在巴西目前的环境下，和其他民主爱国力量结成同盟的工人阶级，完全可以选举出来一个正直的爱国者、能够执行和平和保卫国家主权的政策的人来担任巴西的总统。因此，巴西人民目前有两个迫切的重大任务，一个是孤立并击败企图发动法西斯军事政变的势力，一个是阻止政变策动者和卖国贼当选总统。目前的主要工作是把一切坚决反对策动政变、保卫民主权利和宪法以及争取举行自由选举的力量、团体和政党都团结起来。这是一个广泛的统一战线运动，它已经变成全国政治生活中的一个新的重要因素。
