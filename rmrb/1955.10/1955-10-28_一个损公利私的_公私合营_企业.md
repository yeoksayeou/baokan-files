    A "Public-Private Partnership" Enterprise That Harms the Public to Benefit the Private
    By Our Correspondent Wang Huiping
    Editor's Note: The problems exposed by the "Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory Incident" are extremely serious. On the one hand, it reveals that some lawless capitalists are not honestly accepting socialist transformation but are trying every possible means to achieve their profit-seeking goals by using even more insidious and vicious methods. On the other hand, it also reflects that some state representatives and Party organizations in public-private partnership enterprises have serious right-leaning ideas, have not clearly distinguished between socialism and capitalism, and have seriously abandoned the working-class stance. It must be pointed out that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is an important component of the Party's general line during the transition period and is a long-term, complex, sharp, and profound struggle. Any relaxation of socialist transformation work will harm China's socialist cause. Therefore, Party committees at all levels, relevant departments of the People's Committees, and people's organizations such as trade unions should deeply learn from this lesson and conduct a strict inspection of the work of all public-private partnership enterprises in conjunction with the "Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory Incident" to correctly and forcefully carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.
    The Shanghai Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory is an old factory that became a public-private partnership in 1950. In 1952, the state sent a representative to serve as the general manager of this pharmaceutical factory. However, this state representative, who was supposed to transform the enterprise, abandoned the necessary struggle against the illegal activities of the bourgeoisie, abandoned socialist transformation work, and seriously abandoned their stance. Therefore, for five years, Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory has not only failed to transform the enterprise and the bourgeois elements according to the principles of socialist management but has instead, under the guise of public-private partnership, recklessly sought profits, spread "five poisons," caused enormous losses to the state, while the capitalists made a fortune.
    In public-private partnership enterprises, the principles of socialist enterprise management should be gradually implemented, and state economic policies and the laws of planned development of the national economy should be strictly observed. However, Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory still follows the capitalist management methods of pursuing high profits.
    Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory has always placed its main technical force on the trial production of new products. Trial production of new products, if it starts from meeting the needs of the state and the people, should of course be encouraged. However, the real purpose of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory's trial production of new products is to defraud high profits. Because state-owned pharmaceutical companies do not have pricing standards for new products, they can engage in deception and "ask for the sky-high price." From 1951 to now, Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory has successfully trial-produced a total of forty-eight new products, but twenty-one of them cannot be produced due to insufficient equipment conditions, high costs, and lack of market demand; sixteen have been discontinued due to sluggish sales; and only eleven are currently in actual production. These eleven new products all have high profits to be made. For example, the raw drug "Dihydroxydiphenylhexane," which treats women's diseases, is very valuable, and each kilogram can make 200,000 five-milligram injections, which is not suitable for mass production. However, because the production of this new product can defraud profits of up to 1,000 percent or more, they blindly produced more than 90 kilograms last year, resulting in the vast majority being stockpiled. The "Dapsone" and "Sulfoxone," produced by this factory specifically for the treatment of leprosy, when trial production began in 1951, the capitalist Zhang Penghe entered the most expensive raw materials recorded in the British and American pharmacopoeias into the cost list, but in fact, they were not used. The profit of these two products once reached more than 300 percent, and last year alone, Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory made a profit of 230,000 yuan from these two products, accounting for 38.3 percent of the total annual profit. The selling prices of many other new products produced by Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory are generally more than 50 percent higher than the cost, greatly exceeding the profit standards stipulated by the state. The cost price list of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory is kept secret from state-owned pharmaceutical companies, which is the main means they have adopted to defraud illegal profits from the state for a long time. The product cost of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory is not only higher than that of state-owned enterprises but also higher than that of all private pharmaceutical factories. According to their own inspection: the profit margin of products exclusively produced by Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory is extremely high; the products also produced by other pharmaceutical factories generally lose money at Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory. For example, for injection products, the planned cost is higher than the purchase price of state-owned pharmaceutical companies, and the actual cost is even higher than the planned cost. They themselves said: Stopping production in the injection workshop and paying wages will result in fewer losses than when producing. In principle, if the product loses money, the reasons for the losses should be found, and efforts should be made to improve technology and management. However, Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory does not do this but instead uses high-profit products to compensate for losses and uses the average profit within the enterprise to cover up the shortcomings of enterprise management.
    Zhang Penghe, the capitalist of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory, has always advocated that Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory should produce "products with large output value, high prices, and exclusively produced by Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory" for the purpose of "making big money." It is not surprising that Zhang Penghe has this kind of business thinking because he is a capitalist. What is strange is that this full-fledged bourgeois monopoly thought was actually accepted by Han Baotang, the state representative, and Gao Qianghua, the secretary of the Communist Party branch of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory. Reviewing costs is one of the most important tasks of public-private partnership enterprises. If Han Baotang and Gao Qianghua attached importance to new product trial production work from the perspective of the state's interests and controlled profits, they could achieve the purpose of utilizing its beneficial parts and limiting its harmful parts. But they did not do so. Han Baotang and Gao Qianghua knew about Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory's illegal behavior of defrauding high profits with new products, but Han Baotang ultimately approved one false cost list after another and sent them to state-owned pharmaceutical companies. Their reason is: "The interests of public-private partnership enterprises are the interests of the state," and "making money is also for the state."
    Are "the interests of public-private partnership enterprises the interests of the state" and "making money also for the state?" It is enough to see this from the following incident. The products of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory are exclusively sold by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, obviously, they are earning the money of state-owned companies. And Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory is jointly owned by the public and private sectors, with the capitalists' shares accounting for more than 62 percent. From 1950 to 1954, Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory distributed a total of 120,460 yuan in dividends, of which capitalists received 84,590 yuan, and public shares (including trust shares) only received 35,870 yuan. Can this be said that "the interests of public-private partnership enterprises are the interests of the state" and "making money is also for the state?" Further analysis reveals even more serious problems: the total amount of the capitalists' actual capital in Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory is 83,600 yuan. From 1950 to the end of 1954, the dividends already received by the capitalists plus the appreciation of shares totaled 140,300 yuan. In other words, in just five years, the capitalists have almost taken away twice their investment in Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory. Does this conform to the Party's policy of transforming the bourgeoisie?
    In order to obtain high profits, Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory naturally and completely inherited the speculative management methods of the bourgeoisie. Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory produces "Sulfathiazole" raw drugs. However, for a period of time, they tried their best to buy imported "Sulfathiazole" raw drugs on the market. Originally, in order to save foreign exchange and encourage domestic drugs, the state specifically adopted a subsidy method for the purchase price of "Sulfathiazole" raw drugs. At that time, the black market price of imported "Sulfathiazole" raw drugs on the market was more than 30 yuan per kilogram, and the purchase price of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Pharmaceutical Corporation was originally 58 yuan per kilogram, which was later reduced to 42 yuan. However, in order to take care of public-private partnership enterprises, the products of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory were still purchased according to the original price. The state-owned pharmaceutical company purchased their products at a price of 58 yuan per kilogram and then uniformly allocated them to various pharmaceutical factories at 90 percent of the price of 42 yuan. In order to take care of their production, the state subsidized a lot of money. However, Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory regarded the state's care for them as a good opportunity to make money. On the one hand, they sold their own "Sulfathiazole" raw drugs to the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Pharmaceutical Corporation at high prices. On the other hand, they purchased imported "Sulfathiazole" raw drugs at low prices from the market to manufacture tablets and injections. More seriously, they purchased this product from the market at a black market price of more than 30 yuan per kilogram and then disguised it as their own factory's product and resold it to the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Pharmaceutical Corporation at the preferential price of 58 yuan per kilogram.
    Han Baotang and Gao Qianghua not only did not review this serious behavior that harmed the interests of the state but repeatedly quibbled, saying that Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory's purchase of raw drugs from the black market to manufacture injections and tablets was "completely legal." In fact, the reason why state-owned pharmaceutical companies want to reduce the purchase price of "Sulfathiazole" raw drugs by means of subsidies is to crack down on private merchants using black market prices for speculative activities. Han Baotang and Gao Qianghua understood this. Is it possible to say that consciously destroying the state's economic policies and increasing the state's compensation is "legal?"
    The capitalist business thinking of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory is also manifested in the personnel arrangements within the factory. The Planning Section and the Supply and Marketing Section are the most important functional departments of the factory, and the leading personnel should be politically strong and have a national concept. However, Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory completely abandoned these principles in the selection of cadres.
    The Planning Section is led by Deputy Section Chief Zhong Wenfu. He and the capitalist Zhang Penghe were classmates. Zhang Penghe brought him into the Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory and promoted him to Deputy Section Chief of the Planning Section. How does Zhong Wenfu work? The following facts are the best answers: The selling price of "Dapsone" produced by Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory is two to three times higher than the cost. Someone in the factory once proposed that it should be reduced. However, Zhong Wenfu firmly opposed, saying: "This is a trump card of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory. If the price is reduced, the products with high costs in our factory will have problems." Until now, the selling price of "Dapsone" has not been reduced and continues to defraud high illegal profits from state-owned pharmaceutical companies. Zhong Wenfu has consistently adopted a two-faced approach of outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant in his work. Zhong Wenfu always secretly discussed the production plan and basic construction plan of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory with the capitalist first, and then asked Han Baotang for approval. Han Baotang is nominally the general manager, but in reality, he is just a figurehead. The so-called "approval" is only a formality. The capitalist of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory and the capitalist of Xincheng Chemical Factory are the closest friends. They attempted to merge the two factories to enhance the strength of the bourgeoisie in public-private partnership enterprises. Therefore, Zhang Penghe instructed Zhong Wenfu to persuade Han Baotang to request the Ministry of Light Industry to merge with Xincheng Chemical Factory on the pretext of solving production safety issues. Considering the development prospects of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory, the Ministry of Light Industry did not agree with them doing so. However, these bold capitalists secretly purchased building materials and started construction in the area adjacent to Xincheng Chemical Factory, attempting to create a fait accompli. Due to blind expansion and poor management, the turnover of production funds was seriously affected. Therefore, they used the signboard of public-private partnership to borrow money from the state bank. The total amount of actual capital of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory is 135,000 yuan, while the regular borrowing amount since 1954 has been more than 200,000 yuan. In reality, they are misappropriating the state's useful funds to maintain and expand their enterprises. In their view, this is more "cost-effective" than being counted as state investment, because if it is counted as state investment, they have to share their generous "dividends," while loans only require a small amount of interest.
    The Supply and Marketing Section has no section chief. Deputy Section Chief Yin Jun is a famous rogue in the Chengdu Road area of Shanghai – Little Huangmao, and also the capitalist's confidant. In his supply and marketing work, he has consistently resisted the exclusive sales of state-owned companies, engaged in speculation, and bought and sold short. For example: In the spring of 1953, Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory did not have any conditions for producing "Liuhe Vitamin" tablets. Just because "Liuhe Vitamin" tablets were selling well and had high profits at that time, Yin Jun owed raw materials to private merchants, found outside factories to process them, and then sold the products with the trademark of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory. Soon, there was a surplus of "Liuhe Vitamin" on the market. In order to prevent private merchants from engaging in speculation, the state-owned pharmaceutical company decided to purchase products from various factories at 83 percent of the market price, and raw materials were also purchased at a price. At the same time, it was decided that after the products in progress were completed, all factories should not produce their own products, except for those entrusted to them by pharmaceutical companies for processing. All public and private pharmaceutical factories manufacturing "Liuhe Vitamin" strictly abided by this decision, only Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory refused to sell to the state-owned pharmaceutical company. Yin Jun personally went to Tianjin and sold 25,000 bottles at a price of 4.27 yuan per bottle, with a profit of up to 64 percent per bottle. He sought profit without capital and made a net profit of 20,000 yuan; and violated the regulations of the state-owned pharmaceutical company and continued to produce "Liuhe Vitamin" on his own. Yin Jun was very hostile to the exclusive sales of state-owned pharmaceutical companies and adopted various vicious means to resist them. In 1953, in order to strengthen the planning of market supply, the state-owned pharmaceutical company decided to exclusively sell "Vitamin A, D Pills" and "Vitamin E Pills" produced by Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory. At this time, Yin Jun even asked the pharmaceutical company to exclusively sell other products, deliberately delaying the realization of exclusive sales. In order to oppose the exclusive sales of state-owned companies, Yin Jun also frequently provoked workers to oppose the state. He said to the workers: "We must not let the pharmaceutical company exclusively sell our products. If the pharmaceutical company exclusively sells our products, the purchase price will be much lower than our own sales, the profits will be reduced, and the bonuses for our workers will be less." Yin Jun also adopted the same erroneous attitude towards the processing orders of pharmaceutical companies. In 1954, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Pharmaceutical Corporation entrusted Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory to process a batch of "Liuhe Vitamin." Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory fabricated a very high cost plan of 0.7 yuan per hundred tablets. Later, after the pharmaceutical company verified that 0.24 yuan was enough, when the pharmaceutical company pointed out the error of their falsely reporting the cost to Yin Jun and asked them to correct it based on facts, Yin Jun openly refused to accept the state's processing task, attempting to force the pharmaceutical company to recognize this cost plan, which even they themselves knew was illegal, by means of coercion. Due to the urgency of the task, the pharmaceutical company had to agree to start production according to their cost plan first, and then deduct it based on facts later. Yin Jun used such vicious means to consistently disrupt the exclusive sales of state-owned companies and steal illegal profits.
    Surprisingly, these bourgeois elements who resisted the leadership of the state-owned economy and resisted socialist transformation were actually the people most trusted by Han Baotang and Gao Qianghua. Han Baotang himself admitted: He completely trusts them in business. Why does Han Baotang trust such people? According to Han Baotang himself, it is because: "I don't understand business at all. Although they have serious capitalist business thinking, I have to trust them and rely on them." The business activities of public-private partnership enterprises are dominated by capitalist business thinking, which means that the nature of this enterprise has not actually changed and is still completely capitalist. Since it is known that the leaders of the most important functional departments of the factory have serious capitalist business thinking, why not replace them, rely on workers, and promote worker cadres? Han Baotang said: "Workers are good, but they do not have the ability to work. However, Zhong Wenfu, Yin Jun, and others have strong working ability and are more responsible for their work." Because Han Baotang admires their speculative working ability, when selecting advanced workers in 1954, everyone did not select Zhong Wenfu. Han Baotang was very dissatisfied and finally, ignoring the opposition of the workers, he forced Zhong Wenfu to be "selected" as a second-class "advanced worker."
    For a long time, the capitalists of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory have been carrying out insidious divisive activities against the working class. In August 1952, shortly after the "Five-Anti" movement, the capitalists introduced a production bonus system. The method was to extract 10 percent of the total amount from the enterprise's profits each month and 2 percent each quarter as employee bonuses, which were distributed proportionally according to the employees' wages. While establishing such a bonus system, the capitalists also carried out a series of deceptive propaganda among the employees. They said: "The capitalists run this factory not to make money but have deep feelings for this enterprise like the employees, for the sake of a common cause. Therefore, the capitalists are very concerned about the lives of the employees. And the material life of the employees is closely related to the development of the enterprise." The true meaning of these words is "the higher the profit, the more the bonus, and the higher the personal income." The capitalists cited many facts to prove their point, such as gradually increasing meal allowances, dormitory allowances, and uniform fees for workers as the factory developed. Obviously, this bonus system and other disguised wages are the bourgeoisie's vicious conspiracy to corrupt workers. They use the illegal profits defrauded from the state and the vast number of consumers to undermine the state's correct wage policy and bonus system, deliberately creating differences in wages and bonuses between state-owned enterprises and public-private partnership enterprises, in order to undermine the relationship between workers in various enterprises, between workers and the state, corrupt the thinking of workers, avoid worker supervision of the enterprise, and cover up the illegal activities of capitalists pursuing high profits.
    Although the leading organs had already instructed the state representatives not to accept unreasonable bonuses from public-private partnership enterprises, and later specifically instructed Han Baotang and Gao Qianghua to resolutely abolish this unreasonable bonus system, Han Baotang and Gao Qianghua still looked for various excuses to deliberately delay it, and they themselves also took this bonus. Han Baotang took a total of 787 yuan from April 1953 to the end of 1954; Gao Qianghua took a total of 454 yuan from March 1953 to the end of 1954. This is the main reason why this bonus system has been maintained, and the capitalists have therefore been able to put a legal cloak on all illegal profit-making behaviors and become even more unscrupulous.
    The rampant attack of the bourgeoisie on the working class in Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory is also prominently manifested in the struggle for the leadership of the Technology Section. Zhang Penghe often used the reputation of technical personnel to instill capitalist ideas. Because the Deputy Chief of the Technology Section was close to the Party, under the instigation of the capitalists, the new product research and trial production reports of the technical personnel were given to the capitalists behind the back of the Deputy Chief. Often the Chief of the Technology Section did not know, but a certain new product had already started production.
    Technical work is the most important work in an enterprise. The transformation of technical personnel and senior staff is an important issue related to enterprise transformation and enterprise management. However, Han Baotang has always looked down on technical personnel, rarely approached them, and abandoned ideological education and transformation work for them, and in fact, he has also abandoned the leadership of production.
    Because the state representative of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory actually abandoned socialist transformation work, although it is nominally a public-private partnership enterprise, it is actually completely subject to the interests of the capitalists. For a long time, Han Baotang and Gao Qianghua have believed that Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory has achieved good results in implementing the plan and that production has developed, as if this showed the superiority of public-private partnership. However, does the fact that the production of public-private partnership enterprises has developed to some extent mean that it has become a semi-socialist enterprise? This should be specifically analyzed. The production of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory has indeed increased a lot in recent years, but the more its production increases, the more its speculation also increases, and the greater the losses it causes to the state. And because of the unreasonable bonus system, it has caused the opposition of workers to the Party and the disunity within the workers. Is this a semi-socialist enterprise? A private factory hangs the signboard of public-private partnership. When it is beneficial to itself, it takes out the signboard of cooperation to enjoy the preferential treatment of the state. When it is not beneficial or less beneficial to itself, it goes to the free market and resists socialist transformation. Is this the behavior of a semi-socialist enterprise?
    The sign of whether the work of public-private partnership enterprises is good or bad cannot be viewed in isolation only from the development of its production but must be viewed from what kind of production it is and from the degree to which it obeys the requirements of the state plan and the degree of socialist transformation.
    Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory has a Party branch, but the work of the Party is not visible. In recent years, the Party organization of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory has not adhered to the Party's position and resolutely struggled against behaviors that harm the interests of the state. Even in the face of the rampant attack of the bourgeoisie on the working class, it has not clearly distinguished between socialist and capitalist ideologies and has abandoned the socialist position. A series of illegal activities of the capitalists of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory have almost all been carried out with the consent and support of Gao Qianghua, the secretary of the Party branch. For example, in 1953, Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory formed a consultation group headed by Gao Qianghua and arbitrarily extracted 135,000 yuan from the public accumulation fund to convert it into the appreciation of shares. Because the proportion of private shares in Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory accounts for about 62 percent or more, a part of the public accumulation fund belonging to the enterprise was given to the capitalists in this way. Gao Qianghua's serious abandonment of the Party's position completely safeguarded the interests of the capitalists and harmed the interests of the state and the people. The Party organization of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory did not assist the state representatives in carrying out the dual transformation of the enterprise and the bourgeois elements and completely abandoned the Party's responsibility to guarantee and supervise the economic activities of public-private partnership enterprises. This is the root cause of many major errors.
    The continued development of capitalist management after the implementation of public-private partnership in Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory, the reason why this serious problem has not been interfered with for a long time and cannot be corrected for a long time, is inseparable from the right-leaning thinking of some comrades in the Shanghai Municipal Light Industry Party Committee. The lessons of Minyong Pharmaceutical Factory are profound. The state representatives and Party organizations of all public-private partnership enterprises should understand this lesson well, and the Shanghai Municipal Light Industry Party Committee, which leads this enterprise, should deeply accept this lesson.

    一个损公利私的“公私合营”企业
    本报记者　王惠平
    编者按：“民用药厂事件”所揭发出来的问题是极其严重的。一方面，它揭露了目前某些不法资本家不是老老实实地接受社会主义改造，而是千方百计地采用更加阴险毒辣的手段来达到其唯利是图的目的。另一方面，它也反映了一部分公私合营企业的国家代表和企业的党组织有严重的右倾思想，没有划清社会主义和资本主义的界限，严重地丧失了工人阶级立场。必须指出：对于资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造，是党在过渡时期总路线的一个重要组成部分，是一个长期的、复杂的、尖锐的和深刻的斗争，对于社会主义改造工作的任何一点放松，都会给我国的社会主义事业带来损害。因此，各级党委、人民委员会的各个有关部门，以及工会等人民团体，都应该深刻地接受这个教训，结合“民用药厂事件”对于所有公私合营企业的工作进行一次严格的检查，以便正确地有力地对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造。
    公私合营上海民用药厂，是一九五○年公私合营的老厂。一九五二年，国家派代表去担任这个药厂的总经理。但是，这个代表国家去改造这个企业的公方代表，放弃了对资产阶级的违法行为进行必要的斗争，放弃了社会主义改造工作，严重地丧失了立场。因此，五年来，民用药厂不但没有按照社会主义的经营管理原则来改造企业和改造资产阶级分子，反而在公私合营的招牌掩盖下，肆无忌惮地唯利是图，泛滥“五毒”，使国家遭受了莫大的损失，而资本家却大发其财。
    在公私合营企业中，应该逐步实现社会主义企业的经营管理原则，严格遵守国家的经济政策和国民经济有计划发展的规律。但是，民用药厂仍然沿袭着追逐高额利润的资本主义的经营方法。
    民用药厂向来是把主要的技术力量放在试制新产品上面。试制新产品，如果是从满足国家和人民的需要出发，当然是应该鼓励的。但是，民用药厂试制新产品的真实目的，却是为了骗取高额利润。因为国营医药公司没有新产品计价标准，他们可以弄虚作假，“满天要价”。从一九五一年到现在，民用药厂一共试制成功四十八种新产品，可是有二十一种由于设备条件不够，成本过高，市场不需要，虽然试制成功，也不能生产；有十六种因为销路呆滞而先后停产；目前实际生产的只有十一种。这十一种新产品都是有高额利润可图的。例如治疗妇女病的“二羟二苯已烷”原药，价值很高，每公斤可做二十万支五公丝的针剂，不宜大量生产。但是，由于生产这种新产品可以骗取高达百分之一千以上的利润，他们去年就盲目生产了九十多公斤，结果绝大部分积压了起来。这个厂生产的专治麻疯病的“苯丙砜”、“氨苯砜”，在一九五一年试制成功投入生产的时候，资本家张鹏翮把英美药典上所记载的最贵重的原料开进了成本单，而实际上并没有用。这两种产品的利润，最高曾达到百分之三百以上，去年一年民用药厂仅这两种产品即获利二十三万元，占全年盈余的百分之三十八点三。民用药厂生产的其他许多种新产品，销售价格一般的也都比成本高百分之五十以上，大大超过了国家所规定的利润标准。民用药厂的成本计价单对国营医药公司是保守秘密的，这就是他们长期从国家骗取非法利润所采取的主要手段。民用药厂的产品成本，不仅高于国营企业，而且高于所有私营药厂。根据他们自己的检查：凡是由民用药厂独家生产的产品，利润率都是极高的；凡是其他药厂也生产的产品，民用药厂一般都是赔本的。例如针剂产品，计划成本比国营医药公司收购牌价高，实际成本还比计划成本高。他们自己都说：针剂车间停止生产发工资，赔累数字比生产的时候还要少得多。按理说，产品赔本，就应该找出赔本的原因，设法提高技术，改进管理。但是，民用药厂不这样做，而是以高额利润的产品来补救亏损，用企业内部的平均利润来掩盖企业经营管理的缺点。
    民用药厂的资本家张鹏翮一向主张民用药厂要生产“产值大，价格高，又是民用药厂独家生产的产品”，为的是“赚大钱”。张鹏翮有这种经营思想并不奇怪，因为他是资本家。奇怪的是这种十足的资产阶级垄断思想，竟被公方代表韩保棠和中共民用药厂支部书记高强华所接受。审查成本是公私合营企业最重要的工作之一，如果韩保棠和高强华重视新产品试制工作是从国家的利益出发，在利润上加以控制，就可以达到利用其有利的部分，限制其有害的部分的目的。可是他们没有这样做。民用药厂利用新产品骗取高额利润的非法行为，韩保棠和高强华是知道的，但一张张虚假的成本单仍然被韩保棠最后批准而送进了国营医药公司。他们的理由是：“公私合营企业的利益，就是国家的利益”，“赚钱也是国家的”。
    是不是“公私合营企业的利益，就是国家的利益”，“赚钱也是国家的”呢？这只要看看下面这件事就够了。民用药厂的产品，是由中国医药公司上海采购供应站包销的，显然他们赚的是国营公司的钱。而民用药厂是公私共有的，其中资本家的股份占百分之六十二以上，一九五○年到一九五四年，民用药厂共分发股息红利十二万零四百六十元，资本家分得八万四千五百九十元，公股（包括代管股）只分得三万五千八百七十元。试问，这能说“公私合营企业的利益，就是国家的利益”，“赚钱也是国家的”吗？再进一步分析，我们还可以发现更加严重的问题：民用药厂的资本家实有资本的总额是八万三千六百元，从一九五○年到一九五四年年底，资本家已分得的股息红利加上股本升值共达十四万零三百元，换句话说，只在五年当中，资本家就几乎拿走了等于他们在民用药厂的两倍投资。这难道符合党对资产阶级改造的政策吗？
    为了获取高额利润，民用药厂很自然地完全承袭了资产阶级投机取巧的经营方式。民用药厂是生产“磺胺噻唑”原药的。但是有一个时期他们极力在市场上收买进口的“磺胺噻唑”原药。原来，国家为了节约外汇，鼓励国产药品，对“磺胺噻唑”原药的收购价格特地采取贴补的办法，当时市场上进口货“磺胺噻唑”原药的黑市价格每公斤是三十多元，中国医药公司上海采购供应站的收购牌价原来是每公斤五十八元后来降低到四十二元。但是，为了照顾公私合营企业，对民用药厂的产品仍然按照原来的牌价继续收购。国营医药公司以五十八元一公斤的价格收购他们的产品，然后按四十二元的牌价再打九折统一调拨给各制药厂。为了照顾他们的生产，国家贴补了不少钱。但是，民用药厂把国家对他们的照顾看成了发财的好机会。他们一面把自产的“磺胺噻唑”原药高价卖给中国医药公司上海采购供应站，一面又从市场上低价购进进口“磺胺噻唑”原药来制造片剂和针剂。更严重的是，他们从市场上以每公斤三十多元的黑市价格收买这种产品，然后伪装成自己厂的产品，以每公斤五十八元的优待价格转卖给中国医药公司上海采购供应站。
    对这种严重的损害国家利益的行为，韩保棠和高强华不但不检讨，反而再三狡辩，说民用药厂从黑市买进原药来制造针剂片剂，是“完全合法的”。其实，国营医药公司所以要用补贴的办法降低“磺胺噻唑”原药的收购价格，就是为了打击私商利用黑市价格进行投机活动。这一点，韩保棠和高强华是了解的。这样有意识地破坏国家的经济政策，增加国家的赔累，这难道能说是“合法”的吗？
    民用药厂的资本主义经营思想，也表现在厂内的人事安排上面。计划科和供销科是工厂最重要的职能部门，领导人员应该是政治上很强的，是有国家观念的。但是，民用药厂在干部的选择上，完全放弃了这些原则。
    计划科由副科长锺文甫负责领导。他和资本家张鹏翮是同班同学，是张鹏翮拉进民用药厂并提拔为计划科副科长的。锺文甫是怎样做工作的呢？下面的事实是最好的答案：民用药厂生产的“苯丙砜”，销售价格比成本高二、三倍，厂内曾经有人提出应该降低。但是，锺文甫坚决反对，他说：“这是民用药厂的一张王牌，如果降价出售，本厂其他成本很高的产品就要发生问题。”直到现在，“苯丙砜”的销售价格还没有降低，继续向国营医药公司骗取着高额的非法利润。锺文甫在工作中一贯采取阳奉阴违的两面手法，民用药厂的生产计划和基本建设计划，锺文甫都是事先同资本家暗中商量好，然后再找韩保棠批准。而韩保棠名为总经理，实际上是个空架子，所谓“批准”仅仅是履行手续而已。民用药厂的资本家和信诚化工厂的资本家是最亲密的朋友，他们企图把两个厂合并起来，以增强资产阶级在公私合营企业里的实力。于是，张鹏翮就授意锺文甫，由锺文甫说服韩保棠，以解决生产安全问题为借口，向轻工业部提出要求同信诚化工厂合并。轻工业部考虑到民用药厂的发展前途，不同意他们这样做。但是，这些胆大包天的资本家们，却私自购买建筑材料，选择了同信诚化工厂毗邻地区动工扩建起来，企图造成既成事实。由于盲目扩建加上经营管理不善，严重地影响到生产资金的周转，于是他们又利用公私合营的招牌向国家银行借款。民用药厂实际资本总额共有十三万五千元，而一九五四年以来经常借款额却在二十万元以上，实际上是套用国家的有用资金来维持和扩展他们的企业。这在他们看来，比算做国家投资还要“合算”得多，因为算做国家的投资是要分他们的优厚“红利”的，而贷款只拿少许利息就够了。
    供销科没有科长，副科长殷俊是上海成都路一带出名的流氓——小黄毛，也是资本家的心腹。他在供销工作上，一贯抗拒国营公司包销，投机取巧，买空卖空。例如：一九五三年春季，民用药厂没有生产“六合维生素”片的任何条件，只因为当时市场上“六合维生素”片销路好、利润大，殷俊就向私商赊欠原料，找外厂加工，然后把产品贴上民用药厂的商标出售。不久，市场上的“六合维生素”过剩了，国营医药公司为了防止私商投机取巧，决定按市场价格打八三折收购各厂产品，原料也作价收购。同时又决定各厂在制品完工后，除医药公司委托加工者外，一律不得自产。这个决定，所有制造“六合维生素”的公、私营药厂都严格地遵守了，只有民用药厂拒绝卖给国营医药公司。殷俊亲自出马把产品运到天津，以每瓶四元二角七分的价格卖了两万五千瓶，每瓶利润高达百分之六十四，无本求利，净赚了两万元；并且违反国营医药公司的规定，继续自产“六合维生素”。殷俊十分仇视国营医药公司包销，采取各种恶劣的手段来抗拒。一九五三年，国营医药公司为了加强供应市场的计划性，决定包销民用药厂生产的“维生素甲、丁丸”和“维生素戊丸”，这时，殷俊竟向医药公司提出要求包销其他产品，故意拖延包销的实现。为了反对国营公司的包销，殷俊还经常挑拨工人同国家的关系，他对职工说：“我们决不能让医药公司包销。如果让医药公司包销，收购价格比自销低得多，利润就要减少，我们职工的奖金就要少拿。”对于医药公司的加工订货，殷俊也采取同样错误的态度。一九五四年，中国医药公司上海采购供应站委托民用药厂加工一批“六合维生素”。民用药厂便捏造了一个每百粒七角的很高的成本计划。后来经医药公司核实，只要二角四分就够了，当医药公司向殷俊指出他们虚报成本的错误，并让他们据实修正时，殷俊竟公然拒绝接受国家这批加工任务，企图用要挟的手段强制医药公司承认这个连他们自己也知道是非法的成本计划。由于任务紧急，医药公司不得不同意按照他们的成本计划先行生产，俟后再据实核减。殷俊就是利用这样恶劣手段，一贯地破坏国营公司的包销，窃取非法暴利。
    令人惊奇的是，这些抗拒国营经济领导、反抗社会主义改造的资产阶级分子，居然也是韩保棠和高强华所最信赖的人物。韩保棠自己也承认：在业务上他是完全信赖他们的。为什么韩保棠信赖这样一些人呢？按照韩保棠自己的说法是：“自己对业务根本不懂，虽然他们有严重的资本主义经营思想，也不得不信任，不得不依赖。”公私合营企业的经营活动被资本主义经营思想所支配，这就意味着这个企业的性质实际上并未改变，仍然完全是资本主义的。既然知道工厂最重要的职能部门的领导人员有严重的资本主义经营思想，为什么不撤换他们，依靠工人，提拔工人干部呢？韩保棠说：“工人虽好，但他们没有工作能力。而锺文甫、殷俊等工作能力强，对工作也比较负责。”因为韩保棠赞赏他们投机取巧的工作能力，所以，在评选一九五四年先进工作者的时候，大家没有评选锺文甫，韩保棠非常不满，最后竟不顾工人的反对，硬把锺文甫“选”成了二级“先进工作者”。
    长时期以来，民用药厂的资本家向工人阶级进行着阴险的分裂挑拨活动。一九五二年八月，即“五反”运动过后不久，资本家就搞了一个生产奖励制度。办法是从企业的利润中，每月抽出总额的百分之十每季度再抽出百分之二作为职工奖励金，根据职工的工薪高低按比例分配。在建立这样一个奖励制度的同时，资本家还在职工中间进行了一系列的欺骗宣传。说：“资本家办这个工厂，不是为了赚钱，而是和职工们一样对这个企业有着深厚的感情，为着共同的事业。因此资本家是非常关心职工生活的。而职工的物质生活也同企业的发展切切相关。”这些话的真正意思是“利润高，奖金就多，个人的收入也多”。资本家举出很多事实来证实他的论点，例如随着工厂的发展，陆续给工人增加了饭贴、宿舍贴、制服费等等。显然，这种奖励制度以及其他一些变相工资是资产阶级腐蚀工人的恶毒阴谋，他们利用从国家和广大消费者手中骗取来的非法利润，破坏国家正确的工资政策和奖励制度，故意造成国营企业和公私合营企业之间的工资和奖励上的差别，以破坏各企业工人之间、工人和国家之间的关系，腐蚀工人的思想，避开工人对企业的监督，以掩盖资本家追逐高额利润的非法活动。
    尽管领导机关早已指示公方代表不应接受公私合营企业不合理的奖金，后来又特别指示韩保棠和高强华必须坚决取消这种不合理的奖励制度，可是韩保棠和高强华仍然找寻各种借口故意拖延，而且自己也在拿这种奖金。韩保棠从一九五三年四月到一九五四年年底，共拿了七百八十七元；高强华从一九五三年三月到一九五四年年底，共拿了四百五十四元。这就是这种奖励制度保持下来的主要原因，资本家也就因此能够把一切违法牟利行为披上合法的外衣，而更加肆无忌惮了。
    民用药厂的资产阶级对工人阶级的猖狂进攻，还突出地表现在争夺技术科的领导权方面。张鹏翮经常利用技术人员的名位观念灌输资本主义思想。由于技术科副科长靠近党，在资本家唆使下，技术人员的新产品研究试制报告书，都是背着副科长交给资本家。往往技术科长还不知道，某种新产品却已开始生产了。
    技术工作是企业中最重要的工作，对技术人员和高级职员的改造，是一个关系着企业改造和企业经营管理的重要问题。可是韩保棠一直看不起技术人员，极少同他们接近，放弃了对他们的思想教育和改造工作，实际上也就放弃了对生产的领导。
    民用药厂由于公方代表实际上放弃了社会主义改造工作，虽然名义上是个公私合营企业，实际上是完全服从资本家的利益的。长时期以来，韩保棠和高强华却认为民用药厂执行计划的成绩是好的，生产有了发展，好像这样就表现了公私合营的优越性。但是，公私合营企业生产有了某些发展是不是就是表现了它已成为半社会主义的企业了呢？这应该进行具体分析。民用药厂的生产几年来确实增长了很多，但它生产越增长，投机性也跟着越增长，给国家造成的损失也越大。并且由于有不合理的奖励制度，造成工人同党的对立，造成工人内部的不团结，难道这是半社会主义的企业吗？私营工厂挂上公私合营的牌子，在对自己有利的时候，就拿出合营的招牌享受国家的优待；在对自己无利或少利的时候，就投奔自由市场，抵抗社会主义改造；这难道是半社会主义企业的行为吗？
    公私合营企业工作好坏的标志，不能孤立地只看它的生产发展，而必须看它是什么性质的生产，看它服从国家计划要求的程度和社会主义改造的程度。
    民用药厂有党的支部，但看不见党的工作。几年来，民用药厂的党组织没有坚持党的立场，坚决向损害国家利益的行为进行斗争，甚至在资产阶级向工人阶级猖狂进攻的面前，划不清社会主义和资本主义的思想界限，放弃了社会主义阵地。民用药厂资本家的一系列非法活动，几乎都是在党支部书记高强华的同意和支持下进行的。例如，一九五三年，民用药厂曾以高强华为首组成协商小组，擅自从公积金中提取十三万五千元转为股本的升值。由于民用药厂的私股比重约占百分之六十二以上，这样就把属于企业所有的一部分公积金送给了资本家。高强华这种严重丧失党的立场的作法，完全维护了资本家的利益，损害了国家和人民的利益。民用药厂的党组织没有协助公方代表进行对企业和对资产阶级分子的双重改造工作，完全放弃了党对公私合营企业经济活动的保证监督责任，这是造成许多重大错误的根源。
    民用药厂实行公私合营以后继续发展了资本主义经营，这个严重问题所以长期没有人干涉，长期不能纠正，是同中共上海市轻工业党委中某些同志的右倾思想分不开的。民用药厂的教训是深刻的。一切公私合营企业的公方代表和党的组织都应该很好地领会这个教训，领导这个企业的上海市轻工业党委更应该深刻地接受这个教训。
