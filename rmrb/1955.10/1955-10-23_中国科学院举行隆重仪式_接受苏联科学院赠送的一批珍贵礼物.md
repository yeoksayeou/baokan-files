Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd. The Chinese Academy of Sciences held a grand ceremony on the 22nd to accept a batch of precious gifts from the Soviet Academy of Sciences: paleontological specimens, seismic instruments, spore pollen experimental research equipment, and philosophical books. These gifts were brought by Soviet paleontologists, seismologists, and philosophers who arrived in Beijing on the 16th. They will lecture in China and assist China in scientific work.

At the gift acceptance ceremony, Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, first delivered a speech, expressing his heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Academy of Sciences on behalf of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese scientists. He said, "We must better develop China's scientific endeavors, assist socialist construction, and further join hands with Soviet scientists to jointly safeguard world peace. This is our repayment for the gifts presented by the Soviet Academy of Sciences." Professor Kirpichnikov, Deputy Director of the Paleontological Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, then spoke. He said, "We regard these gifts as a sign of the Soviet Union's friendship towards the Chinese people, and also as a symbol of the Soviet scientists' respect for Chinese scientists." Soviet micropaleontologist Bournovikina, Soviet seismologist Kirnos, and Soviet philosopher Yang Xingxun all spoke at the ceremony. Finally, Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered a thank-you speech. He introduced the valuable value of these gifts and explained their great significance to China's scientific research and economic construction.

Also attending the ceremony were Li Siguang, Zhang Jiafu, Wu Youxun, Vice Presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, as well as more than 60 scientists in geology, paleontology, geophysics, and other fields in Beijing.

The most precious of the ten types of paleontological specimens donated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences by the Soviet Academy of Sciences is a complete fossil of a Karbinginskaya armored dinosaur, 110 centimeters high and 132 centimeters long. The armored dinosaur was a primitive reptile that lived in the late Permian period, about 200 million years ago. It was very large and one of the largest terrestrial animals of the Paleozoic era. It was collected by the famous Soviet paleontologist Amalitsky in the northern European part of the Soviet Union. The species name was named in memory of Academician Karpinsky, the first president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences after the October Revolution and an outstanding geologist and paleontologist. This fossil specimen is one of the best paleontological specimens preserved by the Soviet Academy of Sciences and is a rare scientific data. Therefore, the Soviet Academy of Sciences specially sent paleontological experts to escort this specimen to China. The study of spores and pollen can help solve the problems of stratigraphic correlation and paleogeographic environment. This research is still in its infancy in China. A batch of spore pollen microscope specimens in the gift will provide a standard for Chinese pollen spore research. These gifts have great value in geological and paleontological research. The eleven types of precision seismic instruments are precisely what China urgently needs, including sophisticated instruments suitable for recording strong, weak, distant, and near earthquakes, as well as epicenter locations, the Earth's internal structure, and pulsations; instruments specifically designed for collecting large amounts of weak earthquake data in a short period of time, which are conducive to studying the relationship between earthquakes and geological structures and the causes of earthquakes; and instruments for measuring the intensity of strong earthquakes. These instruments and the philosophical books published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences are of equal importance to the development of China's scientific research.

    中国科学院举行隆重仪式
    接受苏联科学院赠送的一批珍贵礼物
    新华社二十二日讯　二十二日中国科学院举行隆重仪式，接受苏联科学院赠送的一批珍贵礼物：古生物标本、地震仪器、胞子花粉试验研究设备和哲学书籍。这些礼物是由十六日到北京的苏联古生物学家、地震学家和哲学家带来的。他们将在中国讲学和帮助中国进行科学工作。
    在受礼仪式上，中国科学院院长郭沫若首先致词，他代表中国科学院和中国科学家向苏联科学院表示衷心的感谢。他说：“我们要更好地发展中国的科学事业；帮助社会主义建设；并且进一步和苏联科学家携起手来，共同保卫世界和平。这就是我们对苏联科学院赠送礼物的报答。”苏联科学院古生物研究所副所长基尔皮契尼科夫教授接着讲话。他说：“我们把这些礼物看作是苏联对中国人民友好的表示，也看成是苏联科学家对中国科学家尊敬的标志。”苏联微体古生物学家鲍尔诺维金娜、苏联地震学家基尔诺斯和苏联哲学家杨兴顺都在仪式中讲了话。最后，中国科学院副院长竺可桢致谢词。他介绍了这些礼物的宝贵价值并且说明它们对中国的科学研究工作和经济建设的重大意义。
    参加仪式的还有中国科学院副院长李四光、张稼夫、吴有训以及在北京的地质、古生物、地球物理等方面的科学家等六十多人。
    苏联科学院赠给中国科学院的十类古生物标本中最宝贵的是一付完整的卡尔宾斯基头甲龙化石，高一百十厘米，长一百三十二厘米。头甲龙生存在离今约两万万年前即二叠纪后期的一种原始爬行类动物，体积很大，是古生代最大的陆上动物之一。这是苏联著名古生物学家阿玛尔茨基在苏联欧洲部分的北方采集的。种名是为了纪念十月革命后苏联科学院第一任院长、杰出的地质学家和古生物学家卡尔宾斯基院士而订的。这付化石标本是苏联科学院保存的最好的古生物标本之一，是少有的科学资料。所以苏联科学院特地派了古生物学专家一路护送这个标本到中国来。胞子花粉的研究可以帮助解决地层对比与古地理环境问题，这项研究在中国还处在萌芽时期。礼物中的一批胞子花粉显微镜标本将使中国花粉胞子研究工作有了一个标准。这些礼物在地质学与古生物学的研究上有巨大的价值。十一种精密的地震仪器正是中国迫切需要的，其中有适宜于记录强、弱、远、近地震以及震中位置、地球内部构造和脉动的精良仪器；有专为短时期内收集大量弱震资料、有利于研究地震同地质构造的关系和地震发生原因的仪器；有测定强烈地震烈度的仪器。这些仪器以及苏联科学院出版的哲学书籍对发展中国的科学研究都同样有重大的意义。
