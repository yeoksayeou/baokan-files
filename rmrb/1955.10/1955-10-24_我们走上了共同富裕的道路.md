    We Have Embarked on the Road to Common Prosperity
    Lei Guangrong

    Our Shehong Township is located on the banks of the fertile Tuo River in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province. In 1954, the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives in our township reached 65 percent of the total number of households. It is estimated that after the expansion of the cooperatives this winter, the number of member households will reach 88 percent of the total. In the past two years, due to the development of the cooperative movement, the economic and cultural life in our township has changed in every aspect!

    Large-Scale Bumper Harvest

    Our township is rich in sugarcane, flue-cured tobacco, and cotton. Because the majority of farmers in the township have joined cooperatives, we have been able to plant according to local conditions, apply fertilizers rationally, plant at reasonable densities, and select improved varieties. At the same time, we have built nine water conservancy projects, which have generally increased the yield per unit area. Before the establishment of the cooperatives, each mu of cotton field yielded an average of 35 jin of ginned cotton. This year, the total of more than 2,200 mu of cotton in the township can yield an average of 50 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Previously, one mu of sugarcane yielded only 5,000 jin, but now it yields 7,000 jin. In the past, each mu of wheat yielded only 240 jin, but now it has increased to 365 jin. The increased wheat alone exceeds this year's wheat unified purchase quota. Many families in the township could not afford to raise pigs in the past, but now each household raises at least two pigs. Last year, our township sold 80,000 jin of cotton to the state. This year, the cotton harvest is even better, and it is expected that we can sell 100,000 jin. In addition, all 14.6 million jin of sugarcane and more than 20,000 jin of flue-cured tobacco will also be sold to the state.

    Economic Life Rising Together

    Two years of increased production have brought us a prosperous life. In the past two years, the amount of cloth used in our township has increased by 76 percent, and the number of people wearing khaki and foreign cloth has also increased. According to a survey of ten member households of the Liberation Cooperative, before joining the cooperative in 1953, each person wore an average of 4.3 chi of foreign cloth, and only one household wore khaki. This year, each person wears an average of 12.5 chi of foreign cloth, and six out of ten households wear khaki. Now there are also people in the township wearing poplin shirts, and almost all young girls wear printed cloth clothes. Xie Xiandong and his son, members of the Liberation Cooperative, wore cotton-padded jackets for eight years and replaced them with new ones last year. Yang Haijiang, a member of the Shibao Cooperative, used to have three brothers sharing one foreign cloth shirt before liberation. They only took it out to wear when someone got married, worshipped ancestors, or visited relatives. Last year, they each sewed a new set of clothes. The amount of meat eaten in the township has also increased by 68 percent compared to before joining the cooperatives. It was difficult to eat meat even during the New Year and holidays in the past. Last year, the vast majority of members cured bacon during the New Year, and they could eat meat once every ten days to half a month.

    Our lives are improving along the road to common prosperity. Seventy to eighty percent of the poor peasants in the township have risen to the level of middle peasants. Feng Suhua, a member of the Gao Kan Cooperative, used to have very bad harvests due to lack of investment in production. On December 28th of the lunar calendar in 1953, she ran out of food and also incurred a debt of more than 60 yuan. After joining the cooperative in 1954, she earned 118 yuan in the spring season alone, which was 34 percent more than her income for the entire year of 1953. The grain she received was enough to eat until the early spring harvest this year, and she no longer lacks food. This year, she is expected to earn 270 yuan. She plans to pay off all her debts and then sew a new cotton-padded coat for each member of her family.

    Cultural Life Has Become Active

    With the improvement of economic life, cultural life has also become active. There are two public primary schools, one private primary school, and eleven farmers' spare-time schools in our township. During the holidays of the cooperatives, people everywhere are reading books and picture books. Our township has established four libraries, storing more than 1,000 books and picture albums, most of which were given to us by young people from the city. The township subscribes to one copy of the People's Daily, six copies of the Sichuan Daily, one copy of the China Youth Daily, and thirteen copies of the Sichuan Peasants' Daily. Members find readers to read newspapers to them whenever they have time. The township has also organized a club, five cultural and entertainment propaganda teams, including seven small amateur theater groups, six blackboard newspaper groups, seven broadcasting groups, and four slide projection groups. Now, watching movies has become a common occurrence in our township. The two mobile film projection teams in the county often show us movies. We have seen the farmers' favorite films such as "Bumper Harvest," "Spring Breeze Blows to the Nomin River," and "Reconnaissance Across the River." The Sichuan People's Broadcasting Station has also donated four radios to the cooperatives in our township, and we can often hear the voices of Beijing and Moscow.

    New Society, New Atmosphere

    In our township, people have come to regard labor as a glorious thing. The idea of ​​distribution according to work is gradually being established, and labor enthusiasm has been unprecedentedly increased. Women also participate in field production. Nine youth shock brigades have emerged in the cooperatives. During the busy autumn harvest season, groups of female members pick cotton in the cotton fields, old men turn over the seed cotton on the threshing grounds, and seventeen cotton gins hum day and night. Young members have organized a security team to guard the crops day and night. They regard the protection of the autumn harvest as their bounden duty.

    In the cooperatives, people's collectivist ideology is growing. Models of love for the cooperatives and advanced production teams and groups are constantly emerging. Xie Xianzhu, a model of love for the cooperatives and a security guard of the cooperatives who attended the National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists, mobilized members to accumulate 130,000 jin of fertilizer last spring. After the cotton was sown, Li Erniang, a member, became ill and had no time to catch cutworms. He went to catch insects for her for ten consecutive days, so that the two mu of cotton managed by Li Erniang were not damaged by insects. One night, it rained heavily, and he braved the rain to harvest the corn that was placed in the courtyard. Ye Qingshan, a member of the Gao Kan Cooperative, is a cotton production expert. In the past, when others asked him to introduce his experience, he said: "I will not sell the secret for a thousand taels of gold." But after he joined the cooperative, after education, he realized the relationship between the cooperative's production and his own interests, so he passed on his technology and became a technical instructor for the cooperative.

    In our township, orphans, widows, the elderly, and the weak have also been properly taken care of. The Liberation Cooperative has three orphaned households whose lives are entirely taken care of by the cooperative. When it rains, two young people carry water for Tan Mo Niang, who is over sixty years old, to drink. Chen Bingwa, who is fourteen or fifteen years old, lost his parents many years ago. Now the cooperative has designated someone to take care of him, help him arrange housework, and teach him productive labor.

    In order to further develop production and build a better life, in July, on the basis of the great development of cooperativization, we made a production plan for the entire township. By 1957, we require the total output of the township to reach more than 11 million jin of grain, more than double that of 1953, and 35 percent more than in 1955. The amount of cotton sold by the township to the state will increase from the current 100,000 jin to 135,000 jin; sugarcane will increase from 14.6 million jin to more than 24 million jin; flue-cured tobacco will increase from 20,000 jin to 40,000 jin; to further support the country's industrial construction. To ensure the realization of this plan, we will continue to build water conservancy projects, improve the soil, implement rational crop rotation, promote advanced experience, adopt new agricultural tools, and develop various sideline productions, so that our lives will become happier and more prosperous!

    我们走上了共同富裕的道路
    雷光荣
    我们射洪乡，就在四川省简阳县富饶的沱江岸边。全乡一九五四年参加农业生产合作社的农户达到了全乡总农户的百分之六十五。估计今年冬天扩社以后，入社农户将达总农户的百分之八十八。两年来，由于合作化运动的发展，我们乡里的经济文化生活样样都改变了！
    大面积丰收
    我们乡里盛产甘蔗、烤烟和棉花。由于全乡大半数农民参加了合作社，我们在生产方面做到了因地种植，合理施肥，合理密植，选用良种，同时还兴修了九处水利，使单位面积产量普遍提高了。建社前，每亩棉田平均收皮棉三十五斤；今年全乡两千二百多亩棉花，平均每亩可收皮棉五十斤；以前一亩甘蔗只收五千斤，现在收到七千斤；过去每亩小麦只收二百四十斤，现在增加到三百六十五斤，光是增产的小麦就超过了今年小麦统购任务。乡里从前有许多人家喂不起猪，可是现在每户最少都喂有两条猪了。去年，我们全乡卖给国家八万斤棉花，今年棉花收成更好，预计可以卖到十万斤。另外，还有一千四百六十万斤甘蔗和两万多斤烤烟也将全数卖给国家。
    经济生活共同上升
    两年的增产，给我们带来了富裕的生活。两年来我们乡的用布量增长了百分之七十六，穿卡叽、洋布的人也日益增多了。据解放社十户社员的调查，一九五三年入社前每人平均穿洋布四尺三寸，穿卡叽的只有一户，而今年平均每人穿洋布一丈二尺五，十户中间就有六户穿卡叽的。现在乡里穿府绸衬衫的人也有了，年轻的姑娘们差不多也都穿上了花布衣服。解放社社员谢显栋父子俩，穿了八年的棉袄，去年也换了新的。石包社社员杨海江，解放前三弟兄共穿一件洋布衫，谁要结婚拜堂、走亲戚，才拿出来穿，去年就每人缝了一套新衣服。全乡吃肉量比入社前也增长了百分之六十八，以前过年过节都很难吃到肉，去年绝大多数社员过年的时候腌了腊肉，平时十天到半个月还可以吃一次肉。
    我们生活是沿着共同富裕的道路提高的。全乡贫农中有百分之七十到八十已经上升到中农的水平。高坎社社员冯素华过去由于缺少生产投资，收成很坏，一九五三年夏历十二月二十八日就断了口粮，还拉下了六十多元的债。一九五四年入了社，大春一季就收入一百一十八元，比他一九五三年全年的收入还多百分之三十四；分得的粮食够吃到今年接小春，再不缺口粮了。今年预计可收入二百七十元，他准备还清一切债务之后，再给全家每人缝一套新棉衣。
    文化生活活跃了
    随着经济生活的提高，文化生活也活跃起来了。我们全乡有两所公办小学，一所民办小学，十一所农民业余学校。在合作社的休假日，到处都有人在看书、看连环画。我们乡已经成立了四个图书室，贮藏书籍、画册一千多本，大多数是城市青年送给我们的。全乡订有人民日报一份，四川日报六份，中国青年报一份，四川农民报十三份。社员们一有空就找读报员读报。乡里还组织了一个俱乐部、五个文娱宣传队，其中包括七个小型业余剧团，六个黑板报组，七个广播小组，四个幻灯组。现在我们乡里看电影也成为常事了，县里的两个巡回放映队，经常给我们放映电影。我们看到过农民最喜爱的“丰收”、“春风吹到诺敏河”、“渡江侦察记”等影片。省人民广播电台还赠送了四部收音机给我们乡的合作社，我们经常可以听到北京、莫斯科的声音。
    新社会新风气
    在我们的乡里，人们已经把劳动看作光荣的事情了，按劳取酬的思想已在逐渐树立，劳动积极性空前提高，妇女也参加田间的生产了。合作社里，出现了九个青年突击队。在繁忙秋收的季节里，成群结队的女社员在棉田里采摘棉花，老头子在晒场上翻晒籽花，十七架轧花机昼夜不停地响着。青年社员组织了保卫队，熬更守夜地看守着庄稼，他们把保卫秋收当成了自己应尽的义务。
    在合作社里，人们的集体主义思想在增长。爱社人物和先进生产队、组也在不断地出现。我们乡出席全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的爱社模范、社的保卫员谢显洲，去年春天曾带动社员积了十三万斤肥料。棉花播种后，社员李二娘生了病，来不及捉土蚕，他便一连十天点灯去替她捉虫，使李二娘管理的两亩多棉花没有遭到虫害。有一晚下大雨，他冒雨抢收了摆在院坝的玉米。高坎社社员叶青山，是一个棉花生产能手，过去别人找他介绍经验，他说：“我是千两黄金不卖道的。”但是他入了合作社后，经过教育，认识到合作社的生产同自己切身利益的关系，就把技术传出来了，还当了合作社的技术指导员。
    在我们乡里，孤、寡、老、弱也都得到了妥善的照顾。解放社有三户孤人，生活全由合作社照顾。六十多岁的谭么娘，下雨天有两个青年给她担水吃。十四、五岁的陈丙娃，他父母死了多年，现在合作社指定专人照看他，帮助他安排家务，指教他生产劳动。
    为进一步发展生产，建设更加美好的生活，七月间我们在合作化大发展的基础上，作出了全乡的生产规划，到一九五七年，要求全乡总产量达到一千一百多万斤粮食，比一九五三年增加一倍多，比一九五五年增加百分之三十五。全乡卖给国家的棉花，将由现在的十万斤增加到十三万五千斤；甘蔗由一千四百六十万斤增加到二千四百多万斤；烤烟由两万斤增加到四万斤；进一步支援国家的工业建设。为保证实现这个计划，我们将继续兴修水利，改良土壤，实行合理轮作，推广先进经验，采用新式农具，发展各种副业生产，使我们的生活变得更幸福、更富裕！
