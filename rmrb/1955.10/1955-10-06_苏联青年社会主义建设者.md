    Soviet Youth Socialist Builders
    Our correspondent in Moscow
    In the Soviet Union, the Communist Youth League and young workers are a huge force in the further upsurge of industry. More than 3.5 million members of the Communist Youth League work in Soviet factories.
    The Communist Youth League organizations in industrial enterprises are doing a tremendous job in mobilizing Communist Youth League members and all young people to successfully complete national economic tasks.
    This year alone, more than 50,000 Communist Youth League members and young people have been sent to the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station and the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, prefabricated reinforced concrete structure and component manufacturing factories, and railways to participate in construction work, to reclaim wasteland, and to work in coal mines.
    In the nationwide competition to gloriously welcome the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Communist Youth League's main focus is on promoting and applying advanced production experience.
    After the July Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, many discussions on rhythmic production were held in the chassis workshop of the Chelyabinsk Tractor Factory.
    Valentin Videlnikov, a Communist Youth League member in the track gear section, said among his friends:
    "If every machine tool worker in our workshop could do as much as the best workers in their shift, then the indicator chart could be completed every day."
    Section leader Koroshina suggested that Videlnikov teach his classmates to make as many parts as he does himself. Make 150 parts instead of 110-130 parts.
    A school for teaching advanced work experience appeared next to Videlnikov's machine tool. At the Communist Youth League members' meeting, young men and women decided that every young worker should learn the working methods of advanced workers within this year. Communist Youth League member Gennady Ivanov undertook the obligation to help the young workers in his section. In the past, milling machine operator Chepelinko produced no more than 80 parts on her machine in one shift, but after Ivanov taught her how to sharpen the cutter correctly and install the tool at a fixed angle to avoid "disasters" with the parts, Chepelinko began to process 180 parts, and later 200 parts.
    The mastery of advanced working methods by the workers in the workshop quickly showed its effect. In the past, three shifts were needed for grinding work, but now this section only needs two shifts. Two grinding workers were transferred, but the gears made in the section were almost 50% more than before.

    A short, dark-faced young man in a blue work suit carefully watched the work of Excavator No. 66 from the Vakhrushev Coal Trust in Karpinsk. He is Vladimir Petrov, the operator of this excavator. The comrade who just came to replace him was Matveyev, a novice in operating excavators. Petrov quickly climbed into the cab and adjusted the excavator to make its rotation more time-saving. His hands never left the control lever for a second, carefully watching the clamshell, and a continuous and uniform flow of coal poured from the excavator's clamshell onto the conveyor belt. Matveyev watched the work of the old comrade with admiration and envy. And at night, Gennady Yereshev of the third shift held the hand of his former student Petrov for a long time and said:
    "Congratulations on digging more than 3,000 tons – three trains of coal – in one shift, and you remember how we dreamed about this."
    Only a few years ago, Gennady Yereshev, a 17-year-old boy, was still collecting coal that fell from the transporter with a shovel. However, when fitters and excavator operators repaired the machinery, he was reluctant to leave them in order to become familiar with the excavator. Yereshev quickly rose from a motor operator to a machine operator. He was taught by the most experienced machine operator Pankratov – the first among coal miners to start loading 1,000 tons of coal instead of 500 tons in one shift. But his student quickly surpassed his teacher and began to excavate 1,500 tons per shift. Communist Youth League member Yereshev continued to fight for every second. In the past, the production cycle from scooping up coal with the clamshell to placing the coal on the conveyor belt took 33.9 seconds. Yereshev analyzed the work and saw that the machine operators always picked up coal from the nearest place at the beginning, and when they had to pick up coal from the far section, they needed to constantly turn the machine 170 to 180 degrees, so they quickly became tired and could not evenly pour the coal onto the conveyor belt. Yereshev decided to dig one or two clamshells from the near section, and then dig one clamshell from the far section. The machine operators began to be less tired in the new work rhythm, and the load on the conveyor belt was also even... He understood that it was much more beneficial to dig coal with the clamshell at the lowest layer of the exploded coal, and mastered the method of synchronizing the lifting and lowering of the clamshell with the turning of the machine. All of this helped shorten the production cycle to 22-23 seconds.
    Last year, the excavator excavated 1,004,202 tons of coal in the mine. Yereshev called on all machine operators: let everyone excavate one million tons of coal a year. He himself came to the neighboring section. Vasily Valyakin, one of the excellent machine operators and a Communist Youth League member, worked here.
    "Agree, Vasily! It doesn't make sense for us to be million-ton workers alone." Now, there are already two million-ton worker groups in the trust.

    Communist Youth League members are the initiators of many patriotic initiatives. Grigory Pomyadon, a steelworker at the Zaporozhye Steel Plant and a Communist Youth League member, set an example of using oxygen for rapid steelmaking. Together with Communist Youth League members Stepanenko and Onishchenko in his team, he proved that the use of oxygen not only does not reduce but even increases the continuous production period of open-hearth furnaces. The open-hearth furnace looked after by Pomyadon and his friends smelted 540 furnaces of steel without major repairs, instead of the original quota of 350 furnaces, and produced nearly 3,000 tons of metal above the plan.
    This Communist Youth League youth open-hearth furnace team has its own new improvements in every process, saving time. In the past, a lot of iron ore and lime were always loaded into all open-hearth furnaces at one time. Pomyadon and his comrades began to pour loose furnace materials into the furnace in several even portions. In this way, they can heat the furnace materials evenly and melt them quickly. The young steelworkers mastered a more rational method of using oxygen, and they directed it directly into the molten pool. As a result, the smelting time was shortened by another hour. The experience of Pomyadon and his comrades' team has become the wealth of all steelworkers. If all steelworkers could work like Pomyadon, then the increased metal output of the workshop would be equivalent to putting a new 185-ton open-hearth furnace into production. And more than 5 million rubles can be saved in terms of repair materials and refractory materials alone. The saved fuel can allow the entire workshop to work for a whole month.

    Difficulties cannot stop Communist Youth League members. On the contrary, they welcome difficulties with pleasure. Ulyana Svetus, the leader of an excellent Communist Youth League youth work team who came to the construction site with a group of girls, said:
      "In three years, we built a hydroelectric power station on the Svir River. When it was completed, the girls said in unison: We want to go to the Angara River."
    The builders had to build the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station on the Angara River under severe cold conditions. In winter, the soil freezes to a depth of four meters, and the winter lasts for seven months. Therefore, it is necessary to maximize the use of the spring and summer months. On the river bank, from dawn to dusk, you can hear the sound of clamshells and the roar of machines. The main labor front at the hydroelectric power station is building dams and digging foundations. Many young people work in the foundations. The best performers are the youth work teams of Ulyana Svetus, Alexander Smirnov, and Peter Basov. Groundwater gave the construction workers the greatest trouble. And when groundwater made work impossible, the Communist Youth League members engaged in the work of pumping away unwanted water. The entire Communist Youth League drainage team has drained an entire large lake of water from the bottom of the foundation in the last three years alone.

    苏联青年社会主义建设者

    在苏联，共产主义青年团、青年工人是工业进一步高涨中的一支巨大力量。有三百五十万以上的共青团员在苏联的工厂中工作。
    工业企业中的共青团组织在动员共青团员和全体青年顺利完成国民经济任务方面进行着巨大的工作。
    仅在今年就有五万以上的共青团员和青年被派到古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站、装配式钢筋混凝土结构和构件制造工厂以及铁路去参加建筑工作，派到荒地去开荒和派到煤矿去工作。
    在全苏联展开的为光荣迎接苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的竞赛中，共青团的主要注意力集中在推广和运用先进生产经验上。
    苏联共产党中央委员会七月全会以后，在车里雅宾斯克拖拉机工厂的底盘车间中曾进行了多次关于有节奏地进行生产的交谈。
    履带齿轮工段的共青团员瓦连亭·维杰尔尼科夫在朋友们中说：
    “如果我们车间的每一个机床工人在值班中都能做得像最好的工人那样多，那末指示图表就每天都能够完成。”
    工段小组长科罗希娜建议维杰尔尼科夫教会他的同班工人做出像他自己那么多的零件。做一百五十件零件来代替一百一十—一百三十件零件。
    维杰尔尼科夫的机床旁边出现了一所讲授先进工作经验的学校。在共青团员大会上男女青年们决定，每一个青年工人都要在今年内学会先进工作者的工作方法。共青团员根那季依·伊凡诺夫承担了帮助自己工段的青年工人的义务。从前，铣床女工契彼连柯在一班的时间内在自己的机床上生产的零件最多不过八十件，而在伊凡诺夫教会她正确地磨车刀，以固定的角度来装刀具以避免零件的“灾难”以后，契彼连柯开始能加工一百八十件零件，后来能加工二百件零件。
    车间工人们对先进工作方法的掌握很快地表现出了它的效果。从前需要三班来作研磨工作，而现在这个工段只要有两班就足够了。调走了两个研磨工人，可是工段上做的齿轮几乎比从前多了百分之五十。

    一个矮胖的、面色黝黑的穿着蓝色工作服的小伙子仔细地注视着来自卡尔平斯克市瓦赫鲁什采煤托辣斯的第六十六号掘凿机的工作。他就是这个掘凿机的操使者弗拉基米尔·彼得罗夫。刚刚来要替换他的同志——操使掘凿机的新手马特维耶夫的。彼得罗夫很快地爬进驾驶室，并调整掘凿机使它的转动更加节省时间。他的手一秒钟也没有放开操纵杆，仔细地注视着吊斗，而在传送带上则出现了从掘凿机吊斗中倾倒出来的连续不断的均匀的煤流。马特维耶夫带着一种赞美和羡慕的心情注视着老同志的工作。而在夜间，第三班的根那季依·叶雷舍夫长久地握着自己过去的学生彼得罗夫的手说：
    “祝贺你一班就挖了三千吨以上——三列车的煤，而你记得，关于这个是怎样幻想过的。”
    不过是几年以前，十七岁小伙子的根那季依·叶雷舍夫还在用铁锹收集从运输机掉下来的煤。然而，当钳工和掘凿机手们修理机械的时候，他为了想熟悉掘凿机而不愿意离开他们。叶雷舍夫很快地从管理马达的工人升为机器操使者。教他的是最有经验的机器操使者潘克拉托夫——在凿煤手中他是第一个在一班时间内开始装一千吨煤而不是五百吨煤的人。但是，他的这个学生很快赶过了自己的老师，并且开始每班挖掘一千五百吨。共青团员叶雷舍夫继续进行着争取每秒钟的斗争。从前由用吊斗挖起煤到把煤放到传动带上的生产周期需要耗费三十三点九秒。叶雷舍夫分析了工作，并且看到了机器操使者们开始总是从最近的地方拾煤，而当他们不得不从远的地段拾煤的时候，他们就需要不断地把机器转动一百七十度到一百八十度，因此他们很快就累得疲倦了，来不及均匀地把煤倒在传送带上。叶雷舍夫决定从近的部分挖一两吊斗，然后从远的部分挖一吊斗。机器操使者在新的工作节奏中开始不那么累了，而传送带的负荷也均匀了……他了解用吊斗在爆炸了的煤的最低层挖煤要有利得多，掌握了吊斗的升降同机器的转弯并进的方法。所有这一切都帮助缩短生产周期到二十二—二十三秒。
    去年，掘凿机在矿山中挖了一百万又四千二百零二吨煤。叶雷舍夫向全体机器操使者号召：让所有的人一年都掘一百万吨煤吧。他自己来到了邻近的工段。优秀的机器操使者之一、共青团员瓦利雅京在这里工作。
    “赞成吧，瓦西里！光我们单独作百万吨工作者没有意思。”现在，在托辣斯中已经有两组百万吨工作者了。

    共青团员是许多爱国倡议的发起者。萨波罗什炼钢厂炼钢工人、共青团员格里高里·波姆雅东作了利用氧气快速炼钢法的范例。他同本班的共青团员斯切帕年柯和奥尼先柯一起，证明了利用氧气不仅不减低、甚至还能增加平炉的连续生产时期。波姆雅东和他的朋友们看管的平炉没有经过大检修就炼了五百四十炉钢以代替原定额三百五十炉钢，并超计划生产了近三千吨的金属。
    这个共青团员青年平炉小组在每道工序上都有自己的新的改进，都节省了时间。从前，在所有的平炉中一次总是装很多的矿砂和石灰，波姆雅东和同志们开始分几次均匀地向炉中倾入散碎的炉料。这样他们就能够使炉料均匀地加热和迅速熔化。青年炼钢工人们掌握了利用氧气的更合理的方法，他们把它直接引到熔池里面去。结果熔炼时间又缩短了一小时。波姆雅东和他的同志的小组的经验成了所有炼钢者的财富。如果所有炼钢工人都能像波姆雅东那样工作，那末车间所增加的金属产量将等于一个新的一百八十五吨的平炉投入生产。而仅在修理材料和耐火材料方面就可节约五百万卢布以上。节省的燃料能使全车间整整工作一个月。

    困难阻挡不住共青团员们，相反地，他们愉快地迎接困难。一个同一群女孩子来到建筑工地的优秀的共青团员青年工作队队长乌里扬娜·斯维图斯说：
      “三年中我们在斯维尔河上建成了一座水电站，当竣工的时候，姑娘们异口同声地说：我们要到安加拉河去。”
    建设者们不得不在严寒的条件下在安加拉河上建筑伊尔库茨克水电站。在冬季，土地要冻透四公尺，冬季长达七个月。因此，要最大限度地利用春天和夏天的几个月。在河岸上，从天亮到天黑，都可以听得吊斗的哗啦声和机器的轰隆声。在水电站上主要的劳动战线是建筑堤坝和挖掘基坑。许多青年在基坑中工作。表现得最好的是乌里扬娜·斯维图斯、亚历山大·斯米尔诺夫和彼得·巴索夫几个青年工作队。地下水给建筑工作者以最大的麻烦。而当由于地下水使工作变成根本不能进行的时候，共青团员们就从事抽走不需要的水的工作。共青团员全体排水工作者仅在最近三年期间就从基坑底部排走了整整一个大湖的水。
