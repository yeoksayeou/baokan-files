A Textile Worker Who Comprehensively Completes Production Plans Every Year
	Xu Lei
	There is an outstanding female textile worker in Shanghai named Yang Lingying, who is a cone worker in the preparation workshop of the state-owned Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory. Since the first day of China's First Five-Year Plan, she has comprehensively and overfulfilled the state's production plan every year, every month, and every day. Among the cone workers in the preparation workshop, her output is the highest, and she can achieve 100% quality standards. She has never been absent from work except for public holidays and maternity leave in recent years, and her achievements in saving and other aspects are also excellent.
	In modern textile production, turning cotton into cloth involves many processes. When the spun yarn is used for weaving, it must go through the preparation workshop to first make the yarn into cones and then into warp yarns. After warping and sizing, it can be put on the weaving machine. The performance of the cone workshop has a great impact on the quality of the cloth. If there are many defects in the cone yarn, many lumps, small holes, yarn bows, and phenomena of two or three yarns merging will appear on the cloth surface. Yang Lingying has been working in the cone workshop for nearly three years, and not a single defect has ever been found in the cone yarn she made.
	Yang Lingying is 25 years old this year and is already the mother of two children. She doesn't like to talk much and only knows how to bury herself in work. In recent years, although the overall production level has been continuously improving, her output and quality have always been the best: while others make six bags of yarn cones a day, she can make more than eight bags while ensuring 100% quality, and she continues to improve. The administrative target for waste yarn from knots is three inches long, but Yang Lingying's waste yarn is only about two inches, saving one or two inches of yarn per knot. She is also very careful in using tools. Generally, workers change knotting scissors at least once a month, but she can use a pair of scissors for a year. Due to her outstanding achievements in production, she has been awarded the title of Shanghai Textile Industry Labor Model for two consecutive years since 1953; this year, she was also selected as a National Youth Socialist Construction Activist.
	Yang Lingying's production has always been very good. At first, the workers said she was naturally quick, but that was not the case. In 1952, Yang Lingying went to observe and learn the advanced cone working methods of fraternal factories. After returning, she used her own experience to use her brain and made more improvements to the operating methods. In 1953, when Yang Lingying was named a labor model, the workers all said that her production was really good and undeniable; however, Yang Lingying's advanced experience was not summarized and promoted in a timely manner. The secret to her good production was still a mystery. Some workers who were eager to learn enthusiastically ran to ask Yang Lingying: "How do you do your work?" They did not get a satisfactory answer at the time, because Yang Lingying only knew it in her heart but couldn't express it verbally. She could only answer: "Well, look, that's how I do it." This could not satisfy people who were eager to learn, so complaints and dissatisfaction arose. Some people said that the labor model was arrogant and unwilling to teach others.
	The factory's trade union committee learned of this situation and, in early 1954, inspired and helped Yang Lingying summarize her advanced work experience. They discovered that Yang Lingying not only carefully studied and implemented the cone working method, but also had some new creations. Her working method mainly involves operating according to the rules of machine movement, simplifying actions, saving time, coordinating various operations well, being orderly and not flustered, and being meticulous in every action.
	After the experience was summarized, the factory established a special promotion team. During the promotion process, Yang Lingying demonstrated her working methods to everyone and patiently taught each worker how to do it and why to do it. At this time, the workers began to change their views of her, actively learning advanced working methods, and the output and quality of the entire workshop improved significantly. When the quota was revised in the first quarter of 1954, the workshop's quota increased by 20%. As a result, many workers not only admired her good work from the bottom of their hearts, but also saw more of Yang Lingying's advantages, especially her dedicated and meticulous spirit of responsibility, which was unanimously praised by the workers. Everyone said: Yang Lingying is really focused when she is working, and even the loudest noise cannot attract her attention. She always buries her head in her work. Some workers also said that Yang Lingying can actively overcome difficulties. For example, sometimes the yarn cones that are brought in have loose ends and are difficult to work with. Some workers always complain about the yarn workshop, but Yang Lingying not only doesn't complain, but also makes the bad yarn cones well in her hands, and never lowers the quality due to these objective reasons.
	Yang Lingying is not only good at her own production, but also good at learning from the strengths of others. A worker named Wu Amao used the method of pulling two cones with one hand. She thought it was very good because it could reduce one action, so she humbly learned from him. Another time, she heard that a worker named Tang Lanying in another shift used a new knotting method that could reduce waste yarn, and she immediately ran to learn it. When the Shanghai No. 5 Cotton Textile Factory studied the method of using a puller to avoid disconnections, the factory sent her to learn, and she went to learn it happily.
	Yang Lingying is a party member and the leader of the Youth League group. She always actively responds to the calls of the Party and the trade union. In 1953, the factory conducted education on paying attention to quality, mentioning the importance of the quality of the cone workshop to the quality of the entire product. Yang Lingying kept it firmly in her mind and was very concerned about the production quality of the group. She became anxious when the group produced too many bad cones. At the Youth League group meeting, she often mentioned to everyone: if there are many bad cones, there will be more substandard cloth. Every second-class cloth will be sold for 1.3 yuan less, which will cause a lot of losses to the country every year. Another time, Yang Lingying excitedly told everyone that when she was buying cloth in a cloth store, she heard a customer criticize: "Why is this cloth so bad?" She felt very sad, as if she was being criticized herself, and walked out of the cloth store with a red face. She used her personal experience to inspire everyone to ensure quality.
	In recent years, Yang Lingying's life has undergone many changes, from a girl to a mother of two children, but her excellent performance in production has remained unchanged and is constantly improving. A few years ago, when the workers saw that she was working so fast and well, some people tried desperately to catch up but couldn't. Some older workers were both anxious and unconvinced. They were anxious that if they didn't improve production, they would fall further and further behind Yang Lingying; they were unconvinced that Yang Lingying was an unmarried girl who was taken care of by her mother at home, didn't have to sew clothes or cook, and had no family burden, so of course her production would be good! But Yang Lingying soon got married and quickly had children, and her production was still as good as ever. Some workers with more life experience were still not completely convinced, and said: "Although Yang Lingying is married and has children, she doesn't breastfeed, so of course it won't affect her production!" At the end of 1954, Yang Lingying's second child was born, and this time she breastfed herself, bringing the child to the factory's nursery every day. In order not to affect production, she used her meal time to feed the child, always eating quickly and then going to the nursery. By the time she returned to the workshop, at most five minutes had passed, so the output and quality would not be affected due to unskilled preparation workers. This is how she conscientiously and responsibly treated her work. The iron-clad facts finally convinced all the workers, and even the last worker who had been observing had to say: "No argument, Yang Lingying's hard work in production is just good, we can only learn from her."
	Since Yang Lingying's advanced production experience was promoted, the workers have gone from being unaccustomed to being accustomed, from difficult to easy, and now the new working method has been mastered by the vast majority of workers in the workshop. Yang Lingying has become a role model for the cone workers, and the production level of the entire cone workshop has improved significantly. When models were selected in 1954, two new advanced workers emerged in the cone workshop, and Yang Lingying was not the only one who could consistently achieve 100% quality. Some motivated workers further improved production by using their brains. Everyone learns from Yang Lingying, and Yang Lingying also learns from everyone. They learn from each other, use their brains, and constantly improve production to an advanced level.

    一个年年全面完成生产计划的纺织女工
    续磊
    上海有一位优秀的纺织女工，她的名字叫杨玲英，是国营上海第十六棉纺织厂准备车间的筒子工。从我国第一个五年建设计划开始的第一天起，她每年、每月、每天都能全面地、超额地完成国家的生产计划。在准备车间筒子工中，她的产量最高，并能百分之百达到质量标准，几年来除公假产假外从未缺过勤，在节约及其他方面的成绩也是优良的。
    现代化的纺织生产中把棉花变成布，要经过许多工序：把纺出来的细纱用来织布时，必须经过准备车间，先把细纱做成筒子，再做成经纱，然后经过穿扣、浆纱，就可以上织布机了。筒子间工作的成绩好坏，对布的质量影响很大，如果筒子纱的疵点很多，织出的布面上就会出现许多圪塔、小洞洞、纱弓头和两三根纱并在一道的现象。杨玲英在筒子间工作，将近三年，在她所做的筒子纱里从来没有检查出过一个疵点。
    杨玲英今年二十五岁，现在已经是两个孩子的妈妈了。她不大喜欢讲话，只知道埋头工作。几年来，尽管整个生产水平都在不断提高，她的产量和质量成绩总是第一名：别人一天做六袋多细纱管，她能在保证质量百分之百的条件下做到八袋多，而且还在继续提高。接头的回丝行政指标是三吋长，杨玲英的回丝只有两吋左右，接一个头就能节省一二吋纱。她使用工具也很细心，打结头的剪刀一般工人至少一月调换一次，而她一把剪刀可以用到一年。由于她在生产上的突出的成绩，从一九五三年起，接连两年被评选为上海市的纺织工业劳动模范；今年又被选为全国青年社会主义建设积极分子。
    杨玲英的生产一向很好，开始工人们说她是天生的手脚快，当然并不是这样。一九五二年，杨玲英去观摩学习了兄弟厂的先进筒子工作法，回来又根据自己的经验动脑筋，使操作方法有了更多的改进。一九五三年，杨玲英被评选为劳动模范时，工人们都说她的生产是真好，无可非议；可是杨玲英的先进经验没有及时总结推广，究竟她生产好的诀窍在哪里，还是个谜。有些急于学习的工人兴致勃勃地跑去问杨玲英：“你的工作是怎么做法的？”当时没有得到满意的回答。因为杨玲英也只是心里有数、嘴里却说不出，她只能回答：“呶，你看，我就是这样做的。”这是不能满足急于求知的人们的，于是出现了抱怨和不满的话。有人说劳动模范架子大，不肯教给别人。
    厂工会委员会晓得了这一情况，在一九五四年初，启发和帮助杨玲英总结了她的先进工作经验，发现杨玲英不但认真学习和执行了筒子工作法，而且还有一些新的创造。她的工作方法主要是能按机器动作的规律进行操作，简化动作、节省时间，各种操作能很好配合，有顺序、不慌乱，每个动作都一丝不苟。
    总结出经验来以后，厂里专门成立了推广小组。在推广过程中，杨玲英把自己的工作方法表演给大家看，并耐心地教每个工人怎样做和为什么这样做。这时，工人们中间开始改变了对她的看法，积极地学习先进工作法，因而整个车间的产量质量都有了显著提高。一九五四年第一季度修改定额时，车间定额提高了百分之二十。这一来，许多工人不但从心里佩服她工作做得好，也看到了杨玲英更多的优点，特别是她工作专心、一丝不苟的负责精神，得到工人们的一致称赞，大家都说：杨玲英生产时真专心，再大的响动也引不起她的注意，总是埋着头紧张地工作。还有的工人说杨玲英能主动克服困难，比如有时拿来的细纱管纱头松下来很难做，有些工人总是抱怨细纱间，杨玲英不但不抱怨，而且坏的细纱管在她手里照样做得很好，从没有因这些客观原因降低过质量。
    杨玲英不但自己生产好，还善于学习别人的优点。有一个工人邬阿毛采用一只手拔两根筒管的方法，她看了觉得很好，可以减少一个动作，就虚心地向他学习。又有一次，她听说另一个班的工人唐兰英用一种新的接头法可以减少回丝，也马上跑去学习。国营上海第五棉纺织厂有人研究用拉头的方法可以避免脱节，厂里派她去学，她就很高兴地去学了来。
    杨玲英是党员，又是团的小组长，她总是积极响应党和工会的号召。一九五三年厂里进行重视质量的教育，提到筒子间质量的好坏对整个产品质量的重要作用，杨玲英牢牢记在心里，非常关心小组的生产质量，组里出的坏筒子一多，她就着急起来。在团的小组会上，她常向大家提到：如果坏筒子多，就要多出次布。二等布每匹要少卖一元三角，这样一年要给国家造成许多损失。又有一次杨玲英很激动地告诉大家，她在布店买布的时候，听顾客批评说：“这布为什么这么坏？”她听了像批评自己一样，非常难过，红着脸走出布店。她就这样用亲身的体会启发大家保证质量。
    几年来，杨玲英的生活起了许多变化，由一个姑娘成为两个孩子的母亲，但她生产上的优异成绩始终不变，并在不断提高。几年前，工人们看到她工作做得又快又好，有的人拼命追还追不上，有些年纪大的工人又是着急又不服气。着急的是再不提高生产，同杨玲英比起来要越来越落后了；不服气的是，杨玲英是个没结婚的小姑娘，回家后生活上有妈妈照顾，不用缝衣不要烧饭，又没家庭负担，当然生产会好啰！可是杨玲英不久就结了婚，很快又有了孩子，她的生产还是照样好。有些生活经历多的工人还是没有完全服气，又说：“杨玲英虽然结了婚生了孩子，可是自己不喂奶，当然不会影响生产啰！”一九五四年底，杨玲英的第二个孩子又诞生了，这次是她亲自喂奶，每天把孩子带到厂里的托儿所。为了不影响生产，她利用吃饭的时间给孩子喂奶，总是匆匆地吃过饭就到托儿所去，等她回到车间，顶多只开车五分钟，这样就不会因预备工不熟练而影响产量和质量。她就是这样兢兢业业、认真负责地对待着自己的工作。铁一样的事实，终于使所有的工人都服贴了，一直观察到最后的工人也不得不说：“没话讲，人家杨玲英硬碰硬生产就是好，只有好好向人家学习。”
    自从杨玲英的先进生产经验推广以后，工人们由不习惯到习惯，由难变易，现在新的工作法已为车间绝大部分工人所掌握。杨玲英成为筒子工人的榜样，整个筒子间的生产水平有了显著提高，一九五四年评选模范时，筒子间又新出现了两个先进工作者，质量能经常达到百分之百的也不止杨玲英一个人了，有些上进的工人，动脑筋进一步改进了生产。大家向杨玲英学习，杨玲英也向大家学习，她们就是这样互相学习、开动脑筋，把生产不断提高到先进的水平。
