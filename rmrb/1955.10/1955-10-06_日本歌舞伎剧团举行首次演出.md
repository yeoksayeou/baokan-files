    Japanese Kabuki Troupe Holds First Performance
    Xinhua News Agency, October 5th. The Japanese Kabuki Troupe held its first performance in China at the CPPCC Auditorium in Beijing on the evening of the 5th. They performed three Kabuki plays: "Kanjincho," "Keshu Hangonso," and "Futari Dōjōji."
    The Kabuki plays performed tonight, with their strong drama and unique style, and the actors' emotional tone and vivid expressions, won the appreciation and love of the Beijing audience. The first play performed, "Kanjincho," is one of the representative Kabuki plays. It is often performed in Japan and is extremely popular with the Japanese masses. The play depicts the struggle for power between the Genji head Yoritomo and his brother Yoshitsune after the Genpei War between feudal lords in the 12th century. Yoshitsune is protected by his retainer Benkei as he flees. The famous Kabuki actor Ennosuke Ichikawa portrayed Benkei's complex feelings in the play. When Yoshitsune escaped the checkpoint inspection, Benkei, feigning drunkenness, staggered and chased after him on the Hanamichi (a runway through the audience), the entire audience erupted in a storm of enthusiastic applause.
    In the subsequent play, "Keshu Hangonso," Ennosuke Ichikawa also brilliantly portrayed the simple character of the protagonist Ukioya Matahei, showing his despair and surprise. In "Futari Dōjōji," Japanese artists performed dances rich in national characteristics.
    An opening ceremony was held before the performance. People from all walks of life in the capital, including Guo Moruo, Shen Yanbing, Xia Yan, Chen Kehan, Liao Chengzhi, Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Mei Lanfang, Cao Yu, Xie Bingxin, and more than 1,700 literary and art workers, attended the opening ceremony and watched the performance tonight. Yang Hansheng delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Chinese cultural circles, welcoming and congratulating the Japanese Kabuki Troupe on their visit to China, and wishing the friendship and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Japanese people would develop and consolidate day by day. Kunizo Matsuo delivered a reply speech, stating that the Kabuki Troupe's visit to China was to further strengthen the friendship between the neighboring countries of China and Japan, and hoped that the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe could visit Japan soon.
    After the performance, young Chinese literary and art workers presented flowers to the Japanese artists to congratulate them on the success of their performance. The entire audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically for a long time. (Photo attached)
