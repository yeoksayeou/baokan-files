Xinhua News Agency, Paris, October 6th. TASS dispatch from Paris on the 6th: Parisian newspapers published numerous reports about new large-scale conflicts erupting in North Africa. Reports state that the situation is most severe near the border of Spanish Morocco, where French troops are facing vigorous attacks from uprising tribes. Newspapers reported that the insurgents have besieged many French military outposts. In the Bled-Akker-Tigi triangle area, two thousand French soldiers, under the cover of tanks and aircraft, engaged in fierce fighting with the insurgents.

"France-Soir" reported that new uprisings might occur in areas west of Kanour.

According to "Le Monde," another center of conflict is in the central zone, from which insurgent forces are moving southward.

Some newspapers reported on a declaration issued in Cairo by Fassi, leader of the Moroccan nationalist party "Istiqlal," and Khider, leader of the "Algerian National Liberation Front." They announced that the uprising movements in Morocco and Algeria would henceforth be led by a unified command to establish a "North African Liberation Army." The declaration stated, "The North African Liberation Army began military operations on October 1st."

A "L'Humanité" correspondent in Rabat reported that General Pierre Gélard, the French Resident General in Morocco, convened a secret meeting of French military commanders in Morocco to discuss the war situation.

French newspapers pointed out that the events in North Africa have further deepened the divisions among French politicians regarding solutions to the North African issue. For example, "France-Soir" reported that General Gélard has sharp disagreements with the French government regarding plans for action in Morocco.

    摩洛哥许多地方人民武装起义打击法军
    新华社六日讯　塔斯社巴黎六日讯：巴黎报纸刊载了许多消息，报道北非发生了新的大规模的冲突。消息说，西班牙属摩洛哥边界附近的局势最为严重，法军在那里遭到起义部落的有力进攻。报纸报道，起义者包围了许多法国军事据点。在布列德—阿克尔—蒂吉三角地带，法国两千名士兵在坦克和飞机的掩护下同起义者进行了激烈的战斗。
    “法兰西晚报”说，在卡努尔以西的地方，也有可能发生新的起义。
    据“世界报”说，另一个战事中心是中部地带，起义者的部队正在从那里向南移动。
    有些报纸报道了摩洛哥民族主义者政党“独立党”领袖法席和“阿尔及利亚解放阵线”领袖希迪尔在开罗发表的宣言。他们宣布，摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚的起义运动今后将由统一的司令部领导，以便建立“北非解放军”。宣言说，“北非解放军从十月一日起开始军事行动。”
    “义勇军报”记者从拉巴特发出消息说，法国驻摩洛哥总督德拉都将军召集了一次法国驻摩洛哥军队将领的秘密会议，讨论战局。
    法国报纸指出，北非事件使得法国政界人士在对解决北非问题的办法上发生的分歧进一步加深。例如，“法兰西晚报”报道说，德拉都将军同法国政府对于在摩洛哥采取行动的计划有尖锐的分歧。
