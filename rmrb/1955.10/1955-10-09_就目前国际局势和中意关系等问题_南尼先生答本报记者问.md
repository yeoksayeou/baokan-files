    Our Newspaper Report: Mr. Nenni, Vice Chairman of the World Peace Council, Chairman of the Italian National Peace Council, and General Secretary of the Italian Socialist Party, answered the following four questions raised by our newspaper reporter:
    Question: After the Geneva Four-Power Summit, the international situation has generally begun to ease. However, there is a clear concern in public opinion that certain international forces still want to obstruct this trend. In this situation, what do you think countries should do to further promote the relaxation of the international situation? What role can Italy play here?
    Answer: Whether in Europe, America, or even Asia, there are undeniably quite strong forces in the world that oppose the easing of the international situation. We must fight against this force, and the most concrete way to fight is to clearly raise the issue of organizing peace movements and demand that these issues be resolved. Not long ago, in a speech I delivered in Beijing, I already talked about these specific issues. This speech was delivered at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. We must organize the pressure from the people of all countries on their governments and the United Nations in order to reach satisfactory solutions as soon as possible. Only in this way will the "Spirit of Geneva" become a concrete reality, a fact rather than just a hope.
    Question: Please give some opinions on the current situation and future prospects of Sino-Italian relations.
    Answer: The relations between China and Italy are now unfortunately hampered by the fact that our government has not recognized the legitimate government of the People's Republic of China, but maintains relations with the so-called government in Taiwan—although this relationship is completely nominal. I have been conducting a large and public movement to normalize diplomatic, economic, and cultural relations between Rome and Beijing. I have seen very good sentiments and a desire to facilitate this matter in Beijing. I hope to persuade our parliament and government, which are afraid of offending the Americans. As for the Italian people, they have long wanted friendly cooperation with China.
    Question: Do you think a pan-European collective security system can be established? According to the wishes of the European people, especially the Italian people, how can such a security system be established?
    Answer: We should establish a collective security system in Europe as soon as possible. Under the current circumstances, the United States will not be excluded from such a system, because the United States may be able to guarantee this system. The current obstacle is the division of Germany. Moreover, on the other hand, unless a unified Germany stands outside any military alliance, that is, if it does not withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, then people cannot consider Germany's reunification. The fact is that when the United States supports and, to some extent, forces West Germany to be loyal to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it is indirectly opposing the establishment of a European collective security system. However, things are brewing in West Germany as well. If West Germany holds elections, Adenauer and his party are likely to lose a lot of votes, and the Social Democratic Party will gain these votes. In the true sense of the word neutralism, the Social Democratic Party cannot be regarded as neutralist, but it agrees to withdraw from all military alliances so that the reunification of Germany becomes possible.
    Question: What else do you think the world peace movement should do to strive for and maintain lasting world peace?
    Answer: The answer to the fourth question is already included in the answer to the first question. The vigilance of the people of all countries is the decisive factor in maintaining peace and organizing the peace movement.

    就目前国际局势和中意关系等问题
    南尼先生答本报记者问
    本报讯　世界和平理事会副主席、意大利全国和平理事会主席、意大利社会党总书记南尼先生，对本报记者提出的四个问题答复如下：
    问：在日内瓦四国首脑会议后，国际局势开始普遍缓和。但是，舆论有一种明显的担心，即仍然有某些国际势力想阻挠这种趋势。在这种情况下，你认为各国应当如何来促进国际局势的进一步缓和？意大利在这里能够起什么作用？
    答：不论在欧洲、在美洲、甚至在亚洲，现在世界上不可否认都有相当强大的势力在反对国际局势的缓和。我们必须对这种势力进行斗争，而最具体的斗争方式就是很明确地把组织和平运动的问题提出来，并且要求这些问题获得解决。不久以前，我在北京发表的一篇演说，已经谈到了这些具体问题，这篇演说是我在中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会发表的。我们必须把各国人民加于各国政府和联合国的压力组织起来，以便尽快得出圆满的解决办法。只有这样，“日内瓦精神”才会成为具体的现实，成为一个事实而不仅是一个希望。
    问：请您对中意两国关系的现状和前途发表一些意见。
    答：中国和意大利的关系现在不幸被下面这一事实在妨碍着，这一事实就是：我国政府没有承认中华人民共和国的合法政府，反而和那个所谓台湾政府保持着关系——虽然这种关系是完全有名无实的。我曾经进行一个使罗马与北京之间的外交、经济和文化关系趋于正常化的巨大而且公开的运动。我在北京已经看到了非常好的情绪和促成这件事的愿望。我希望说服我国那个害怕触犯美国人的议会和政府。至于意大利人民，他们是早已要同中国友好合作的了。
    问：您认为全欧集体安全体系是能够建立起来的吗？按照欧洲人民特别是意大利人民的意愿，怎样才能够建立起这样一个安全体系？
    答：我们应该尽快在欧洲建立一个集体安全体系。根据目前的情况，美国是不会被撇开在这样的体系以外的，因为美国也许可以对这一制度起担保作用。现在的障碍是德国的分裂。而且在另一方面，若不是统一的德国站在任何军事联盟以外，也就是说，它如果不退出北大西洋条约组织，那末人们就无法考虑德国恢复统一。事实是，美国在支持并且在某种程度上强迫西德效忠于北大西洋条约组织的时候，就是在间接地反对建立欧洲的集体安全体系。然而，在西德内部现在也正有事情在酝酿。如果西德举行选举的话，阿登纳和他的政党很有可能失去很多选票，而由社会民主党把这些选票得去。按中立主义这个词的真正涵义来说，社会民主党不能算是中立主义者，但是它同意退出一切军事联盟，俾使德国恢复统一成为可能。
    问：您认为世界和平运动还应该作些什么来争取和维护世界持久和平？
    答：对于第四个问题的答复已经包括在对第一个问题的答复里面。各国人民提高警惕是维护和平和组织和平运动的决定性因素。
