    Rewarding Creative Labor of Scientific Workers
    Based on the "Provisional Regulations on Science Awards of the Chinese Academy of Sciences" recently promulgated by the State Council, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has adopted the "Provisional Organizational Rules of the Science Awards Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences" and decided to award the first Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Awards in 1956. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has also issued a notice regarding the number of awards, scope of recommendations, recommendation methods, recommendation dates, and announcement dates for the first Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Awards, and the recommendation work has already begun. The establishment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Awards is another important measure to promote the development of China's scientific undertakings. Scientific workers throughout the country will be encouraged by the promulgation and implementation of these regulations, further stimulate their enthusiasm and creativity in scientific research, and make more and greater contributions to the victory of the socialist construction of the motherland.
    Our Party and government fully appreciate the important role of science in the process of socialist construction. Since the founding of the country, they have shown great concern for scientific research work, creating various favorable conditions for the development of scientific research work in all aspects, and continuously improving them. Our Party and government have always regarded scientists as valuable assets of the country and society, believing that they must be valued and respected, and that scientists who have made significant contributions to science should be given high honors and significant rewards. The Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Awards Regulations stipulate that "Science research work or scientific works by citizens of the People's Republic of China, which have made significant achievements in academic terms or have significant significance for the development of the national economy and culture, ... shall be awarded the Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Awards." "The winners of the awards shall be awarded the honorary title of Winner of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Awards." These correctly reflect the Party and government's science award policy. From here, and from the comparison of the status and situation of scientific work and scientists before and after liberation, every scientific worker can deeply appreciate the superiority of the socialist system and the consistency of individual interests with national interests in the new society, thereby further enhancing their patriotic awareness and their enthusiasm for engaging in scientific research for the motherland and the people.
    Since liberation, Chinese scientific workers have made certain achievements. Therefore, awarding the first Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Awards next year is entirely timely and necessary. In order to do a good job in the solemn work of evaluating and awarding the first Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Awards, in addition to the Chinese Academy of Sciences taking on the main responsibility, scientific research institutions, universities, industrial departments, and other institutions outside the Academy must also actively and conscientiously assist. First of all, all research institutions, universities, and other institutions responsible for recommendations should, within the specified time, recommend all valuable scientific research work or scientific works with high academic standards made in various fields throughout the country since the founding of the country without omission, and responsibly provide clear explanations and evaluations of their academic significance and significance to the national economy. Individual scientific workers can also request recommendations according to the work system. The Science Awards Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is about to be established, should, under the leadership of the Standing Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, work with the various departments to earnestly and conscientiously do a good job in review and evaluation within the prescribed time. During the review and evaluation, it should proceed from the actual situation of China's scientific work, fully absorb the opinions of relevant experts, correctly grasp the standards, so that all scientific work and works that have made the greatest contributions to academic and national construction since the founding of the country will first receive the Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Awards, creating a good start for the implementation and development of China's formal scientific award system.
    In order to fully implement the science award policy, it is obviously not enough to simply establish the Chinese Academy of Sciences Science Awards. Research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, research institutions of various industrial departments, universities, and other units should also establish various types of scientific award systems or methods separately when conditions are ripe, so that China's scientific award system will be gradually improved, and more outstanding scientific workers can be appropriately rewarded for their contributions to the motherland. As for inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals related to production, they should be rewarded in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on Rewards for Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production" promulgated in 1954.
    It must be pointed out that the establishment of the science award system is only one of the important measures to encourage the enthusiasm of scientific workers and promote the development of scientific undertakings, and it is by no means all of it. Therefore, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other scientific institutions must also strengthen their work and improve their work in all aspects. Only in this way can the science award system play its due role in promoting the rapid development of China's scientific undertakings.
    Scientific workers throughout the country, in order to respond to the Party and government's deep concern for scientific workers, let us engage in our creative labor more actively and enthusiastically!

### 奖励科学工作者创造性的劳动

    奖励科学工作者创造性的劳动
    根据国务院最近颁布的“中国科学院科学奖金暂行条例”，中国科学院通过了“中国科学院科学奖金委员会暂行组织规程”，并决定在一九五六年颁发第一次中国科学院科学奖金。关于第一次中国科学院科学奖金的奖励名额、推荐范围、推荐办法、推荐日期、公布日期等，中国科学院也已发出通告，推荐工作已经开始。中国科学院科学奖金的设立，是促进我国科学事业发展的又一重要措施。全国科学工作者都将因这个条例的颁布和实施而得到鼓舞，进一步发挥自己在科学研究方面的积极性和创造性，为祖国社会主义建设的胜利作出更多、更大的贡献。
    我们的党和政府充分估计到科学在社会主义建设过程中的重要作用，因而在建国以来，对科学研究工作表现了极大的关心，从各个方面为科学研究工作的发展创造了各种有利的条件，并且在继续不断地改进。我们的党和政府一贯把科学家看成是国家和社会的宝贵财富，认为必须重视和尊敬他们，特别对那些在科学上有重大贡献的科学家更应当给予崇高的荣誉和重大的酬谢。中国科学院科学奖金条例规定：“凡中华人民共和国公民的科学研究工作或科学著作，在学术上有重大成就或对国民经济、文化发展上具有重大意义的，……授予中国科学院科学奖金。”“对奖金获得者授予中国科学院科学奖金获得者的荣誉称号”。这些都正确地体现了党和政府的科学奖励政策。从这里，从解放前后科学工作和科学家的地位和处境的对比中，每一个科学工作者都可以深刻地体会到社会主义制度的优越性，在新社会中个人利益与国家利益的一致性，从而更加提高自己的爱国主义觉悟，提高自己为祖国、为人民从事科学研究的热忱。
    解放以来，我国科学工作者作出了一定的成绩，因此，在明年颁发第一次中国科学院科学奖金是完全适时和必要的。为了做好评选、颁发第一次中国科学院科学奖金这一庄严的工作，除了中国科学院应当担负起主要的责任之外，科学院以外的科学研究机关、高等学校、产业部门及其他机关也必须积极认真地加以协助。首先，一切负责推荐的研究机关、高等学校及其他机关应当在指定时间内，将全国各方面在建国以来所作出的有价值的、具有较高学术水平的科学研究工作或科学著作无遗漏地推荐出来，并对它们的学术上的意义和国民经济上的意义负责地作出明确的说明和评价。科学工作者个人也可以按照工作系统请求推荐。即将成立的中国科学院科学奖金委员会应该在中国科学院院务常务会议领导之下，会同各学部，在规定时间内严肃认真地做好审核、评选工作。在审核评选的时候，应从我国科学工作的实际情况出发，充分吸收有关专家的意见，正确地掌握标准，使建国以来一切在学术上和对国家建设贡献最大的科学工作和著作首先得到中国科学院科学奖金，为我国正规的科学奖励制度的实施和发展创造良好的开端。
    为了充分贯彻科学奖励政策，仅仅设立中国科学院科学奖金显然还是很不够的。中国科学院各研究机构、各产业部门的研究机构、高等学校等单位在条件成熟时也应该分别建立各种各类的科学奖励制度或办法，使我国科学奖励制度逐步完备起来，使更多的优秀的科学工作者都能因为他对祖国的贡献而得到适当奖励。至于有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议，则应按照一九五四年颁布的“有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”进行奖励。
    必须指出，科学奖励制度的建立只是鼓励科学工作者的积极性，促进科学事业的发展的重要措施之一，而决不是它的全部。因此中国科学院和其他科学机关，还必须从各个方面加强工作，改进工作，只有这样，科学奖励制度对我国科学事业的迅速发展才能发挥应有的推动作用。
    全国科学工作者们，为了回答党和政府对科学工作者的深切关怀，更积极地热情地从事自己的创造性劳动吧！
