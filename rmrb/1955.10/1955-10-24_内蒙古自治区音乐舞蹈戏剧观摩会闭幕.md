The first Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region National Folk Music, Dance, and Drama Festival, held in Hohhot, closed on the 20th after twenty days of splendid performances. Among the 282 programs performed at the festival, 136 programs won awards for Best Work, Festival Performance Award, and Art Award. Of the more than 800 performers from eight ethnic groups including Mongolian, Han, Hui, Manchu, Daur, Solon, Korean, and Oroqen who participated in the performances, 322 received certificates of merit and performer awards.

In recent years, the art work of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has developed greatly. There are now 35 professional troupes and more than 1,100 amateur troupes. Of the 136 award-winning programs, in addition to 56 newly created programs such as the Mongolian storytelling "Iron Python Ox" which praises the Jining-Erlian Railway, there are also many excellent works that have been circulating in Inner Mongolia for quite some time. For example, the narrative poem "Gada Meilin," which praises the Mongolian national hero, is a well-known song to everyone in Inner Mongolia.

To meet the demands of the audience, the conference, in addition to 27 festival performances, also gave 12 public performances, with an audience of more than 12,300 people. From the 21st, some of the award-winning programs were publicly performed in Hohhot for three consecutive days. (Xinhua News Agency)

    内蒙古自治区音乐舞蹈戏剧观摩会闭幕
    内蒙古自治区在呼和浩特举行的第一届民族民间音乐舞蹈戏剧观摩演出大会，经过二十天的精彩会演，已在二十日闭幕。这次会演的二百八十二个节目中，有一百三十六个节目分别得了作品奖、大会演出奖、艺术奖。参加演出的蒙、汉、回、满、达呼尔、索伦、朝鲜、鄂伦春等八个民族的八百多名演员，有三百二十二人得了奖状和演员奖。
    几年来，内蒙古自治区的艺术工作有很大发展，现有职业剧团三十五个，业余剧团一千一百多个。这次得奖的一百三十六个节目中，除歌颂集二线的蒙古说书“铁蟒牛”等新创作的五十六个节目以外，还有许多已在内蒙古流传了相当年代的优秀作品。例如歌颂蒙古民族英雄“嘎达梅林”就是内蒙古妇孺皆知的一首叙事诗。
    为满足观众要求，大会除会演二十七场外，还公演了十二场，观众达一万二千三百多人次。从二十一日起，部分得奖节目在呼和浩特连续公演三天。（新华社）
