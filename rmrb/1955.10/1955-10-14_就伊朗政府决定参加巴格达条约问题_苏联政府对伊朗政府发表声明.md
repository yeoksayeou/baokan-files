Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 12th (TASS): The Soviet Government issued the following statement to the Iranian government:

    Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov received Iranian Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to the Soviet Union, Aitsami, on October 12th and issued the following statement to him:

    "The Soviet government learned from news published in newspapers that the Iranian government intends to join the Turkish-Iraqi-Pakistani military alliance, the so-called Baghdad Pact, in which Britain also participates. The Soviet government has not received notification from the Iranian government on this issue, but the Soviet government cannot but consider the aforementioned news to be of serious significance.

    Therefore, the Soviet government deems it necessary to issue the following statement:

    The conclusion of the Baghdad Pact signifies the establishment of a military bloc in the Near and Middle East, and this military bloc is a tool of certain aggressive groups that are not concerned with strengthening peace and international security. Another purpose of establishing such a bloc is to maintain and restore the colonial dependence of the countries in this region.

    Iran's participation in this military bloc is incompatible with the interests of strengthening peace and security in the Near and Middle East, and is in conflict with the good-neighborly relations between Iran and the Soviet Union, as well as the well-known treaty obligations undertaken by Iran."

    Aitsami said that he would immediately convey the above statement to the Iranian government.

    就伊朗政府决定参加巴格达条约问题
    苏联政府对伊朗政府发表声明
    新华社十三日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：苏联政府对伊朗政府发表声明如下：
    苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫在十月十二日接见了伊朗驻苏联临时代办艾特萨米，并向他发表声明如下：
    “苏联政府从报纸上所发表的消息中知道，伊朗政府打算参加土耳其—伊拉克—巴基斯坦军事联盟，即所谓巴格达条约，英国也参加了这个条约。苏联政府在这个问题上没有得到伊朗政府方面的通知，但是苏联政府不能不认为上述消息具有严重的意义。
    为此，苏联政府认为有必要发表声明如下：
    巴格达条约的缔结意味着在中近东建立军事集团，而这个军事集团是不关心加强和平和国际安全的某些侵略集团的工具。建立这种集团的另一目的是要维持和恢复这个地区的国家的殖民地依赖地位。
    伊朗参加这个军事集团是同加强中近东地区的和平和安全的利益不相容的，并且是同伊朗和苏联的善邻关系以及伊朗所承担的人所共知的条约义务相抵触的。”
    艾特萨米说，他将立刻把上述声明转达伊朗政府。
