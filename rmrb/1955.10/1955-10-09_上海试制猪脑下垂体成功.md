    Shanghai Successfully Trials Production of Pig Pituitary Glands
    The Shanghai Supply Station Frozen Meat Processing Plant of the China Food Company has successfully trialled the extraction of pig pituitary glands and has recently begun formal production. The Shanghai Supply Station of the China Food Company has signed a contract with the export department, preparing to export this new commodity in large quantities to earn foreign exchange.
    Pig pituitary glands are the main raw material for manufacturing hormones and medicines for treating rheumatism, and are a best-selling commodity on the foreign market. In the past in China, pig pituitary glands were sold together with pig heads and were not well utilized. (Yu Zhihong, Xi Deyuan)

    上海试制猪脑下垂体成功
    中国食品公司上海供应站冻肉加工厂试取猪脑下垂体成功，最近开始正式生产。中国食品公司上海供应站已经同出口部门签订合同，准备将这一新商品大量出口换取外汇。
    猪脑下垂体是制造荷尔蒙和治风湿痛药品的主要原料，在国外市场上是畅销商品。在我国，猪脑下垂体过去都随猪头一起出售，没有很好地加以利用。　（俞志洪、席德元）
