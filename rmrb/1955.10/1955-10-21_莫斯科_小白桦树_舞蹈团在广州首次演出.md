Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 19th: The Soviet Moscow "Little Birch Tree" Dance Troupe held its first performance of its visit to China at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou on the evening of the 18th. Every program performed by this dance troupe, famous in the Soviet Union and Europe, won lasting and enthusiastic applause from nearly 5,000 spectators. Many programs were repeated once or twice at the request of the audience.

    An opening ceremony was held before the dance troupe's performance. Zhu Guang, Mayor of Guangzhou, first extended a warm welcome to all members of the dance troupe on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the people of Guangzhou. He said: The broad masses of the people of Guangzhou eagerly anticipate seeing the performance of the "Little Birch Tree" Dance Troupe, not only because it brings the glorious Soviet art, but also because through the wonderful performances of its actors, the people of the two countries will be more deeply united as an inseparable whole.

    Nadezhdina, the artistic director of the dance troupe, said in response: The road from Moscow to Guangzhou is long, but we did not feel how far this road was, because it is a road to our friends. After Nadezhdina's speech, young literary and art workers from Guangzhou presented flowers to the dance troupe amidst warm applause.

    The first program performed at the evening party was the Russian girls' round dance "Little Birch Tree." This dance beautifully describes the arrival of spring on the earth and also in the hearts of the girls. The dance troupe often begins its performances with this dance, which symbolizes the breath of spring and the poetic natural beauty of the Soviet motherland. A group of girls holding tender birch branches and wearing long skirts first moved lightly and silently on the stage, as if floating on water, and then the girls danced a lively round dance. Among the programs performed by the dance troupe were also classical and modern beautiful dances. Among them were the "Ancient Northern Round Dance," which reflects the simple style of the Russian northern people, "Maidens' Gadri Dance," "Cossack Women's Dance," "Maidens' Competition Dance," and "Soviet Young Women's Dance," which describe the youthful vitality of the girls, as well as the beautiful and poetic "Swan Dance," and the Maiden Lyric Dance, which Chinese audiences are already familiar with from the film "Happy Life."

    After the dance troupe successfully concluded its first performance, it was immediately invited to attend a banquet hosted by Zhu Guang, the Mayor of Guangzhou. The guests and hosts chatted together until late at night.

    莫斯科“小白桦树”舞蹈团在广州首次演出
    新华社广州十九日电　苏联莫斯科“小白桦树”舞蹈团十八日晚在广州中山纪念堂举行来中国访问的首次演出。这个闻名苏联和欧洲的舞蹈团演出的每个节目，都博得全场近五千观众经久不息的热烈掌声，许多节目应观众的要求重演一次到两次。
    舞蹈团演出前举行了开幕仪式。广州市市长朱光首先代表中华人民共和国文化部和广州人民，向舞蹈团的全体团员表示了热烈的欢迎。他说：广州市广大人民殷切期待看到“小白桦树”舞蹈团的演出，这不仅是因为它带来了光辉的苏维埃艺术，而且将通过它的演员们的美妙的演出，使两国人民更加从心灵深处结成一个不可分离的整体。
    舞蹈团艺术领导人纳杰日金娜代表舞蹈团致答词说：从莫斯科到广州的道路是漫长的，但是，我们并没有感到这条路怎样遥远，因为这是一条通向我们的朋友那里去的道路。纳杰日金娜讲话结束后，广州青年文艺工作者在热烈的掌声中向舞蹈团献了花。
    晚会上表演的第一个节目是俄罗斯少女环舞“小白桦树”。这个舞蹈美妙地描述着春天来到了大地，也来到了少女们的心里。舞蹈团经常以这个象征新春气息和苏维埃祖国富于诗意的自然美景的舞蹈来开始自己的演出。一群拿着青嫩的白桦枝、穿着长裙的少女们首先在舞台上轻盈无声地移动，有如在水上漂游，接着少女们跳起了明快的环舞。舞蹈团表演的节目中，还有古典的和现代的优美舞蹈。其中有反映俄罗斯北方人民纯朴风格的“古代的北方环舞”，有描述少女青春活力的“少女加德利舞”、“哥萨克女子舞”、“少女竞演舞”、“苏维埃女青年舞”，有美丽而富有诗意的“天鹅舞”，还有中国观众从影片“幸福的生活”中已经熟悉了的少女抒情舞。
    舞蹈团成功地结束了第一场演出后，随即应邀出席了广州市市长朱光的宴会。宾主在一起畅叙直到深夜。
