From Farming Team to Cooperative
   ——A Visit to the Xibei Agricultural Cooperative in Caixi Township, an Old Revolutionary Base Area
    Qian Bai

    Caixi Township in Shanghang County, Fujian Province, is one of the famous old revolutionary base areas in western Fujian. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, it was a well-known model township. Those who have read Comrade Mao Zedong's "Investigation of Caixi Township" will still remember the heroic image of the people of Caixi Township. Today, as the people of the whole country are welcoming the upsurge of cooperativization, what is happening to the heroic people of Caixi Township? Recently, I visited an agricultural cooperative in Caixi Township – the Xibei Agricultural Production Cooperative.

      A Glorious Road

    The Xibei Agricultural Cooperative is located in Xibei Village, Caixi Township. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in this village has a glorious historical tradition.

    In 1929, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of Caixi Township launched an uprising and established a worker-peasant democratic government. The peasants fought the local tyrants and distributed land. To protect their fruits of liberation, they actively responded to the Party's call to expand the Red Army. At that time, more than eighty young people from Xibei Village, which had more than one hundred households, joined the Red Army and went to work elsewhere. After a large number of laborers joined the Red Army and revolutionary work, the remaining women, elderly people, and Young Pioneers organized "farming teams" to help the families of Red Army soldiers with production. During these days, the farming teams built water conservancy projects, reclaimed wasteland, and rushed to harvest and plant, playing a significant role in production. The old farmers in the village who participated in the farming team at that time still remember the situation, saying: Since the Communist Party came in the "eighteenth year" (1929), there were five consecutive years of good harvests. All the wasteland in the village was reclaimed, and even miscellaneous grains were planted on the field ridges. The year Chairman Mao came to the township (1933), the harvest was particularly good, it was truly a bumper harvest, and every family had surplus grain.

    In 1934, when the Red Army went north to resist the Japanese, the landlords and bullies followed the Kuomintang reactionaries back to Caixi Township, seized the land distributed to the peasants by the worker-peasant democratic government, and forcibly disbanded the "farming teams." However, the people still maintained the original tradition of mutual aid and cooperation. They supported each other in production. Those with surplus labor helped those with insufficient labor, and they exchanged labor during busy farming seasons to overcome production difficulties.

    In 1949, the people of Caixi Township saw the light of day again, and happy days returned. After the land reform, the Party called on the peasants to organize, and Xibei Village immediately organized four mutual aid groups. In 1953, the poor peasant activists in the four mutual aid groups jointly organized the first agricultural production cooperative in the township, which is now the Xibei Agricultural Cooperative.

    Three Years of Achievements in Running the Cooperative

    Since the establishment of the Xibei Agricultural Cooperative, it has achieved great success in production, setting a brilliant example for the peasants of the whole county, district, and township.

    Xibei Village is an old revolutionary base village. Due to long-term devastation by the enemy, it lacked labor, had insufficient production funds, and the land yield was very low. After the cooperative was established, it still encountered many difficulties. However, the peasants of Xibei Village, from the historical experience of the farming teams, clearly understood that the road of mutual aid and cooperation was a bright avenue. They overcame numerous difficulties, did a good job in the cooperative's production, vigorously processed and fertilized the low-yield fields, and continuously overcame several serious natural disasters. In the autumn of 1953, the soybeans in the cooperative suffered from a serious insect plague. All the cooperative members spent a full eight days removing the insects, rescuing more than sixty mu of soybean fields from the mouths of the insects. That year, the soybeans of many individual farmers were completely lost, but the cooperative achieved more than 80% of the harvest. The drought between spring and summer this year brought particularly great difficulties to the cooperative's production. Nearly one hundred mu of fields in the whole cooperative could not be planted with seedlings. The members came up with various ways to resist drought and rush to plant. The first and second production teams could not find water sources for more than two mu of fields, so they mobilized team members to carry water from streams two or three li away to dissolve the soil. Members Lei Tenghong and Lei Qingzhang cut off the soles of their rubber shoes to make pistons in order to repair the water pump and rescue the drought-stricken fields. Through the active drought resistance of the whole cooperative, more than thirty mu of the original sixty mu of fields planned to be replanted were planted in time.

    Due to a series of technical reforms in production and overcoming natural disasters, the Xibei Agricultural Cooperative has achieved continuous bumper harvests for three years: In 1953, rice production increased by 21.3% compared to 1952, and sweet potato production increased by 40%; in 1954, overall production increased by 12.7% compared to 1953, and increased by 24.8% compared to the better Lei Hongchun mutual aid group in the village; this year, early rice increased by 10.21% compared to 1954. Now the cooperative's autumn crops are growing very lushly: sweet potato vines cover the furrows, soybeans are bearing many green pods, and the red tassels of sorghum are drooping. The members are all smiling and saying: We will definitely be able to increase production by another 10% this autumn.

    Xibei Village is surrounded by hills. In the past two years, the cooperative has opened up mountains to plant tung trees, tea trees, and bamboo forests. Now the tung tree seedlings have grown to be one person tall.

    The cooperative also spent more than two hundred workdays and more than three hundred yuan to build a water-powered rice mill beside the stream, using water power to pound rice, saving a lot of time for all the women in the cooperative to engage in agricultural labor.

    Singing a Happy Life

    With the establishment of the cooperative and the development of production, the lives of the members have generally improved. The head of the cooperative, Lei Fochun, told me the following story:

    During the autumn harvest distribution in 1953, member Qiu Ximei increased her grain income by more than 800 jin. That night, this 58-year-old woman was so happy that she couldn't sleep. She composed a folk song herself and sang it softly:

    Since joining the cooperative, there have been many benefits, I am happy today to sing a folk song
    Last year, the grain was not enough to eat, this year there is a surplus of more than two hundred
    It is really happy to join the cooperative, this year the autumn harvest will increase again
    Not to mention the extra grain, plus eight or nine dan of sweet potatoes
    I won't tell you, you don't know, the cooperative's income is so great
    In the past, everyone had no salt to eat, this year there is money to make new clothes

    This folk song soon spread throughout the township and became one of the folk songs loved by the people in the township. The members all love to sing folk songs. Whenever they are resting from work, on a bright moonlit night, the young girls and young men gather together and sing to their heart's content about their new life.

    从耕田队到合作社
   ——革命老根据地才溪乡溪北农业合作社访问记
    蒨白
    福建省上杭县才溪乡是闽西著名的革命老根据地之一，第二次国内革命战争时期，它是有名的模范乡。读过毛泽东同志“才溪乡调查”的人，都还会记得才溪乡人民的英雄形象。今天，当全国人民正在迎接合作化高潮的时候，英雄的才溪乡人民究竟怎样呢？最近我访问了才溪乡的一个合作社——溪北农业生产合作社。
      光荣的道路
    溪北农业合作社在才溪乡溪北村，这个村子的互助合作运动，有着光荣的历史传统。
    一九二九年，才溪乡人民在中国共产党领导下举行了暴动，建立了工农民主政权。农民们打土豪、分田地，为了保卫自己的翻身果实，纷纷响应党扩大红军的号召，参加红军和赤卫队。当时一百多户的溪北村，就有八十多个青壮年参加红军和出外工作。大批劳动力参加红军和革命工作后，留下来的妇女、老人、少先队员组织了“耕田队”，帮助红军家属生产。在这些日子里，耕田队兴修水利、开垦荒地、抢收抢种，在生产上发挥了很大的作用。现在村上参加当时耕田队的老农民，都还记得当时的情形，他们说：自从“十八年”来了共产党，连续丰收了五年，村里的荒地开尽了，就去开山，田塍上也种上了杂粮。毛主席到乡里来的那年（一九三三年）收成特别好，真是五谷丰登，家家有余粮。
    一九三四年，红军北上抗日，地主恶霸跟着国民党反动派回到才溪乡，夺去了工农民主政权分给农民的土地，强迫解散了“耕田队”的组织。但是人民仍旧保持着原来互助合作的传统，他们在生产上互相扶持，劳动力有余的人，帮助不足的人，农忙时互相进行换工，克服生产上的困难。
    一九四九年，才溪乡人民重见了天日，幸福的日子又回来了。土地改革后，党号召农民组织起来，溪北村立即组织了四个互助组。一九五三年，四个互助组中的贫农积极分子联合组织起全乡第一个农业生产合作社，这就是现在的溪北农业合作社。
    办社三年的成就
    溪北农业合作社办社以来，生产上取得了很大的成绩，为全县、全区、全乡农民树立了光辉的榜样。
    溪北村是一个革命老基点村，由于受到敌人长期摧残，劳动力缺乏，生产资金不足，土地产量很低。合作社办起来以后，依然碰到了很多困难。但溪北村农民从耕田队的历史经验中，就明确了互助合作道路是条光明大道，他们克服重重困难，搞好了社的生产，在低产田里大力进行加工加肥，连续战胜了几次严重的自然灾害。一九五三年秋季，社里的黄豆受到了严重的虫灾，全体社员整整的除了八天虫，把六十多亩田的黄豆从虫子的口里抢救出来。这一年，很多单干农民的黄豆全部失收，合作社却得到了八成多的收获。今年春夏之间的旱灾，给合作社的生产带来了特别大的困难。全社有近一百亩田插不下秧。社员们想出了各种办法来抗旱抢种。第一、第二耕作队有两亩多田找不到水源，就发动队员到二、三里路外的溪里去挑水来溶田。社员雷腾洪、雷庆章为了修理抽水筒，抢救受旱的田地，把自己的胶鞋底剪下来做活塞。经过全社积极抗旱，原来打算改种的六十多亩田有三十多亩及时插上了秧。
    由于在生产上进行了一系列的技术改革和战胜了自然灾害，溪北农业社三年来连续取得了丰收：一九五三年比一九五二年水稻增产百分之二十一点三，甘薯增产百分之四十；一九五四年比一九五三年全面增产百分之十二点七，比村里较好的雷洪春互助组增产百分之二十四点八；今年早稻又比一九五四年增产百分之十点二一。现在社里的秋庄稼长得十分茂盛：甘薯蔓盖满了垅沟，黄豆结着许许多多的青豆角，高粱的红穗头低垂着，社员们都笑嘻嘻地说：今年秋季一定又能增产一成。
    溪北村四周都是山坡，两年来合作社开山种了油桐、茶树和竹林，现在油桐树苗已长得有一人高了。
    合作社还在溪水旁边，花了二百多工、三百多元修了一个水碓，利用水力舂米，使全社妇女节省下很多时间来从事农业劳动。
    歌唱幸福生活
    随着合作社的建立和生产的发展，社员生活普遍得到了改善。社长雷佛春告诉我这样一个故事：
    一九五三年秋收分红的时候，社员邱细妹增加了八百多斤粮食收入。这一天晚上，这位五十八岁的老太婆高兴得睡不着觉，她自己编了一首民歌，一个人轻轻地唱了起来：
    自入社来好处多我今快乐唱民歌
    旧年谷子不够吃　今年剩余二百多
    入得社来真幸福　今年秋季又增产
    多分谷子不说它　加分番薯八九担
    我今不讲你不知　社里收入好大哩
    往年大家没盐食　今年有钱做新衣
    这首民歌不久就传遍全乡，成了乡里人喜爱唱的民歌之一。社员们个个喜爱唱民歌，每当劳动之余，月明风清之夜，年青的姑娘们和小伙子围在一起，尽情地歌唱自己的新生活。
