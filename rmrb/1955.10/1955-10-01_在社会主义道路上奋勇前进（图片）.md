Today, all 600 million people in China are celebrating the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China with joy and enthusiasm.

In the past year, our people have made new and significant achievements on the road of socialist construction. Modern factories and mines have been put into production one after another; a number of new products that our country could not produce in the past have been manufactured batch after batch; new railways and new bridges are being built on a large scale; a new upsurge in the agricultural cooperative movement in the vast countryside is about to arrive, and farmers are selling large quantities of grain, cash crops, and sideline products to support the country's socialist industrialization; the Yellow River, which has caused harm for thousands of years, has begun preparations for fundamental treatment and comprehensive development in the people's era... Our motherland is about to enter a new upsurge of comprehensive socialist construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Yang Limen reports: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company supplied many new products to all parts of the country this year, including steel for building factories; thin steel sheets for manufacturing automobiles; silicon steel for manufacturing generators; and alloy seamless steel pipes for manufacturing ball bearings. Many of the newly built and rebuilt projects of Anshan Iron and Steel are increasingly playing its role as a base in the country's socialist construction. The picture shows the fourth automated blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel that has been put into production.

Xinhua News Agency, Xue Yin reports: The day when our country manufactures its own cars is getting closer and closer. At present, the construction plan of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has completed 87 percent of the total project. The picture shows the exterior view of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.

Wu Yihui reports (Hubei Daily): The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project, which connects China's north-south transportation, has started construction ahead of schedule in the third year of the first five-year plan. Currently, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project is being stepped up.

Li Xi and Wang Yibo reports (Beijing Daily): The mileage of track laying of many new railways across the country is constantly extending forward. The picture shows the Fengtai-Shacheng Railway, which opened to traffic on July 15 this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhang Ruihua reports: The state-owned Jiyu County Mechanical Farm in Shanxi Province harvested 1,285 mu of winter wheat planted last year on saline-alkali land where crops could not be grown in the past. The picture shows farmers near the farm coming to visit during the wheat harvest, and they excitedly said: Agricultural mechanization has great power, and crops can be grown on saline-alkali land.

Xinhua News Agency, Tan Zhiqiang reports: The mechanized and automated Hegang Mining Bureau's No. 1 Mine (formerly Dongshan Vertical Shaft) started production on September 20. The picture shows a train adorned with silk and彩绸 carrying high-quality coal mined by workers from the No. 1 Mine to other places.

Xinhua News Agency, Wang Shaoqing reports: The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has begun producing 1A62 machine tools. This kind of machine tool can be used in general machinery manufacturing plants to process more than half of the parts.

Yu Min reports (Heilongjiang Daily): Most of the machines in the copper mesh factory of China's first modern copper mesh factory, the state-owned Jiamusi Paper Mill, have begun trial production. The commissioning of this factory will play a major role in the development of China's paper industry.

Zhou Xuemeng reports (Agricultural Film Studio): Double-cropping rice in the Liling County area of Hunan Province has had bumper harvests for many years. From 1952 to 1954, the average yield of double-cropping rice in the county was more than 600 jin per mu; this year, the average yield of early rice alone reached about 400 jin per mu. The picture shows members of the No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hejialong Township explaining the experience of selecting early rice seeds to members of the double-cropping rice visiting group from Anhui, Guizhou, Sichuan and other provinces organized by the Ministry of Agriculture.

Xinhua News Agency, Sun Zhongjing reports: This autumn, crops are expected to have a bumper harvest in most parts of the country. Due to the high yields of most agricultural production cooperatives and the increase in the actual income of the members, the vast agricultural areas have seen the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives with their own eyes. Soon, a new upsurge in the cooperative movement will appear in the vast rural areas of the country. The picture shows members of the Feilong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gongping Township, Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, a major rice-producing area, turning over newly harvested grains after a bumper harvest, preparing to sell the dry and clean grain to the state to support socialist construction.
