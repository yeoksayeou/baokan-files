Xinhua News Agency, October 25th. Sun Li-jen, the Chief of Staff of the Chiang Kai-shek "Presidential Office," who was "dismissed" and placed under house arrest by Chiang Kai-shek two months ago, has recently been handed over by Chiang Kai-shek to the pseudo "Ministry of National Defense" for "continuous observation to see the effect," and will continue to be monitored and kept under surveillance.

The Chiang Kai-shek "Central News Agency" recently published the "investigation report" on Sun Li-jen by the "Investigation Committee" headed by Chen Cheng, listing various "sins" of Sun Li-jen and his subordinates such as "contacting each other" and "revealing dissatisfaction." The "report" also revealed some facts about Chiang Ching-kuo and Chen Cheng's "planned attack" on Sun Li-jen. The "report" also revealed that since May of this year, a large number of Sun Li-jen's confidants and former military officers, as well as students of the "Fourth Military Officer Training Class" formerly headed by Sun Li-jen, have been arrested by Chiang Kai-shek on charges of "conspiring to create turmoil" and "attempting to affect morale."

As previously reported, Sun Li-jen was "dismissed" by Chiang Kai-shek due to internal factional strife within the Chiang Kai-shek clique and long-term friction between Sun Li-jen and Chiang Kai-shek and his direct descendants, Chiang Ching-kuo and Chen Cheng.

According to Hong Kong newspaper reports, the large-scale arrests carried out by Chiang Kai-shek in the name of the "Sun Li-jen case" have greatly expanded in recent months. The arrested Chiang army officers include a group of former subordinates of He Yingqin. He Yingqin, who served as a "member of the investigation committee" in the so-called Sun Li-jen case, has gone to Japan under the pretext of "treating eye diseases."

The news also said that before the "Sun Li-jen case" occurred, Bai Chongxi, Xue Yue, Yan Xishan, and others who fled to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek were already under house arrest. Chiang Kai-shek army generals such as Li Yutang were shot by Chiang Kai-shek. At present, Chiang army officers who do not belong to the Chen Cheng faction or the Chiang Ching-kuo faction are even more fearful. Within the Chiang Kai-shek army, the mutual strife between Chiang Ching-kuo's secret service system and Chen Cheng's officer system is also developing.

### 蒋贼集团内部派系倾轧激烈  大批军官被捕人人自危

    蒋贼集团内部派系倾轧激烈
    大批军官被捕人人自危
    新华社二十五日讯　在两个月前被蒋贼“免职”和软禁的蒋贼“总统府”参军长孙立人，最近已被蒋贼交给伪“国防部”“随时考察，以观后效”，继续加以监视看管。
    蒋贼“中央社”最近发表了以陈诚为首组成的“调查委员会”对孙立人的“调查报告书”，历述孙立人和他的部属“联络来往”和“流露不满情绪”等种种“罪愆”。“报告书”也透露了蒋经国、陈诚对孙立人“有计划打击”的一些事实。“报告书”还透露，从今年五月以来，孙立人的亲信干部和旧部军官以及前孙立人主持的“第四军官训练班”的学员，已大批被蒋贼以“阴谋制造变乱”、“企图影响士气”等罪名加以逮捕。
    前已报道，孙立人被蒋贼“罢免”，是由于蒋贼集团内部派系倾轧，孙立人同蒋贼及其嫡系蒋经国、陈诚的长期摩擦。
    据香港报纸消息，几个月来，蒋贼以“孙立人案”为名进行的大逮捕已大大扩大，被捕的蒋军军官中，包括一批何应钦的旧部在内。担任所谓孙立人案“调查委员会委员”的何应钦，已以“医疗眼疾”为理由去了日本。
    消息又说，在“孙立人案”发生以前，跟随蒋贼逃到台湾的白崇禧、薛岳、阎锡山等已处于被软禁的境遇。蒋贼军将领李玉堂等被蒋贼枪毙。目前，不属于陈诚系或蒋经国系的蒋军军官更加人人自危。而在蒋贼军中，蒋经国的特务系统和陈诚的军官系统之间的互相倾轧也在发展中。
