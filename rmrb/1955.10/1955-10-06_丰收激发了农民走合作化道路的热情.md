To the Editor:

    The township of Gongping, Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, is filled with the joy of a bumper harvest. Since the early rice harvest began in August, one piece of good news about high yields has followed another. The average yield of many agricultural production cooperatives reached more than 700 jin, and some high-yield fields reached more than 1,100 jin per mu. People laughingly say: This year's autumn harvest is one where "grain piles grow daily, and yields increase steadily!"

    Across the fields of the township, people are busy harvesting everywhere. The work is intense, but the joy of the harvest encourages everyone, and no one feels tired. All seventy threshing machines in the township are also busy, and the heavy grains pour down with the rotation of the machine wheels, like a golden waterfall. The township used hand-cranked threshing machines last year, but this year they have been turned into foot-operated ones, so many female members can participate in threshing labor. Even the children are not idle during the harvest season. More than 700 young people in the township participated in the grain-picking campaign, and by September 9th, they had picked up 1,162 jin of rice.

    By mid-September, more than half of the township's harvest had been completed. Judging from the harvesting situation, the township will be able to over fulfill the 5% increase in rice production target. According to the results of the distribution trial calculation: the income of the twenty-five agricultural production cooperatives in the nine villages of the township will generally increase by more than 20%, and the highest, the Ninth Village General Cooperative, will reach 48.08%. Among the original 1,105 cooperative members, the vast majority have increased their income, some even more than doubled; individual households with weaker labor or special circumstances whose income has decreased are being taken care of as much as possible during the current rush harvesting by giving them light odd jobs such as collecting grass and drying rice, which can also make up for the shortfall.

    The bumper harvest has greatly inspired people's confidence and enthusiasm for taking the path of cooperation. The members of the agricultural production cooperatives are extremely excited about the increase in their income. Granny Yang of the Ninth Village General Cooperative, who is nearly sixty years old, is so happy that she can't close her mouth, and says to everyone she meets, "Chairman Mao's guidance is definitely correct!" Li Wengen, a poor peasant from the Eighth Village General Cooperative who joined the cooperative this spring, increased his family's income by more than 40%. He happily said to the cooperative director Chen Jizhi, "Individual production can't withstand any wind or rain; if our family hadn't joined the cooperative this year, I don't know what we would have become!" Chen Liangyou, a middle peasant in the First Village Branch Cooperative who used to grow good crops, saw that the average field in the cooperative exceeded his average yield in previous years, and also said convincingly, "Cooperation is definitely different! This road is definitely the right one!"

    The enthusiasm of farmers outside the cooperative to join the cooperative has become even higher! Recently, more than 95% of the farmers in the township who have not joined the cooperative have written applications, urgently requesting to join the cooperative. Li Gongbei, a middle peasant, joined the Eighth Village Second Branch Cooperative when it was established, but because he was worried that his large bull would be undervalued, he finally withdrew from the cooperative at the beginning of March; after withdrawing from the cooperative, he was sick for more than a month, the seedlings were planted four or five days late, and the second weeding was not done at all, resulting in each mu of land yielding nearly two dou less grain than the cooperative. During this expansion of the cooperative, he found the cooperative director Deng Bingquan and said, "As long as the cooperative lets me come back, I won't withdraw from the cooperative again even if you beat me with a stick!" Fifteen farmers including Li Wanjiang, adjacent to the Second Village General Cooperative, have their household registrations in the Sixteenth Village of Wenjia Township, but their fields are next to the cooperative's fields, and their households are connected to the cooperative's households. Last year, when they saw the cooperative's bumper harvest, they couldn't suppress their desire to join the cooperative. This spring, they asked to break the township and village boundaries and let them join the Second Village General Cooperative. At that time, the cooperative did not agree. This time, they again submitted applications to join the cooperative to the CPC Wenjiang County Committee and the Second District Committee; the County Committee and the District Committee, based on their urgent request and the convenience of the terrain, have approved their request. Each of the fifteen farmers smiled happily from the bottom of their hearts. On the day they joined the cooperative, they handed over all the production funds and seeds they had prepared to the cooperative at once. In the recent busy days of rush harvesting and rush planting, they showed enthusiasm and initiative.

    Under the urgent demands of the broad masses of farmers, two new agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the township, and the original twenty-five old cooperatives have expanded and absorbed two hundred and eighty new members. Ninety-two percent of the farmers in the nine villages have become members of agricultural production cooperatives!

    In order to strive for a greater harvest, people are actively increasing various means of production and expanding reproduction with unparalleled enthusiasm and confidence. The agricultural production cooperatives in the township have jointly transported 80,000 jin of the best potato seeds back from Peng County and Mianyang, to prepare for the rush planting of autumn potatoes in front of them and the expansion of spring potatoes next spring. In the month since the early rice harvest began, the total value of collective purchases of production materials within the agricultural cooperatives in the township alone has reached more than 9,000 yuan.

    At present, people are enthusiastically grasping the rush harvesting on the one hand, and actively rushing to plant late autumn crops on the other hand. Now the agricultural cooperatives in the township have sown nearly 1,000 mu of spring sweet potatoes, and rushed to plant more than 200 mu of autumn potatoes, more than 300 mu of red carrots, and more than 400 mu of sweet potato vines. In order to actively support the country's industrial construction, each village and cooperative has assigned special personnel to busy themselves with turning and drying grain, waiting for the government's notice to send the "one dry, two clean, three full" grain to the state's warehouses at once.

### 丰收激发了农民走合作化道路的热情

    丰收激发了农民走合作化道路的热情编辑同志：
    四川省温江县公平乡，到处洋溢着丰收的气息。自从八月开始收割早稻以来，高额产量的喜讯一个接着一个传来。不少农业生产合作社的平均产量达到七百多斤，有些丰产田每亩产量达到一千一百多斤。人们欢笑地说：今年的秋收是“谷堆天天涨，产量节节高”！
    全乡满坝遍野，到处是忙于收割的人们。工作是紧张的，但是丰收的喜悦鼓舞着大家，谁也不感到疲劳。全乡的七十部打谷机也忙碌起来了，沉甸甸的谷粒随着机轮的转动而倾泻下来，像一条黄金的瀑布。这个乡去年用的打谷机还是手摇的，今年已经变成了脚踩的，因此不少女社员都能参加了挞谷劳动。连孩子们在收割的季节里也不闲着。全乡七百多个青、少年参加了捡粮运动，到九月九日为止，已经捡了黄谷一千一百六十二斤。
    九月中旬，全乡收割已经过半了。从收割情况看，全乡能够超额完成百分之五的水稻增产任务。根据分配试算的结果：全乡九个村二十五个农业生产合作社一般都增加收入在二成以上，最高的九村总社达到百分之四十八点零八。原有一千一百零五户社员中，绝大部分都增加了收入，有的甚至增加了一倍以上；个别劳力较弱或特殊情况减少收入的户，在目前抢收调工中尽量通过收草、晒谷子等轻杂活路给予照顾，也可以弥补起来。
    丰收，大大激发了人们走合作化道路的信心和热情。农业生产合作社的社员们为自己收入的增加而感到无比兴奋。九村总社年近花甲的杨婆婆高兴得合不拢嘴，逢人就说“毛主席指引的路子准没错”！八村总社今春才入社的贫农李文根全家增加收入四成多，他高兴地对社长陈继志说：“独户搞生产，那经得起一点儿风吹雨打；如果我们这家人今年没有入社呀，不晓得拖成个啥样儿哪！”一村分社往年做惯好庄稼的中农陈良友，看见社里一般田都超过了他往年的平均产量，也心服地说：“合作化到底不同！这条路硬是走对了！”
    社外农民要求入社的热情更加高涨起来了！最近，全乡百分之九十五以上没有入社的农民都写了申请书，迫切要求入社。中农李公贝在八村二分社建社时曾经入了社，但是因为耽心他的大牯牛被低估了价，终于在三月初退出了社；出社后本人病了一个多月，秧子迟栽四、五天，全部没薅二道，结果每亩田比社里少收了将近三斗谷子。这次扩大社时，他找着社长邓丙全说：“只要社里让我回来，以后用棒棒打我也不再退社了！”二村总社邻近的李万江等十五户农民，户口本在文家乡十六村，可是他们和社里田挨田，户连户，去年看到社里丰收时，就压不住要求入社的热望。今年春天，他们要求打破乡、村界线让他们加入二村总社。那时候，社里没有同意。这次他们又向中共温江县委会和二区区委会提出了入社申请；县委、区委根据他们的迫切要求和地形的方便，已批准了他们的要求。十五户农民一个个高兴得从心窝里笑开了。入社那天，他们一次就把早已准备好的生产资金和种籽一齐交到了社里，在最近抢收抢种的紧张日子里，他们表现得热情和积极。
    在广大农民群众的迫切要求下，全乡又新建了两个农业生产合作社，原有二十五个老社又扩大吸收了二百八十户新社员。九个村的百分之九十二的农户都成了农业生产合作社的社员了！
    为了争取更大的丰收，人们怀着无比的热情和信心，积极增加各种生产资料，扩大再生产。全乡各农业生产合作社已联合从彭县和绵阳运回最好的洋芋种八万斤，为眼前抢种秋洋芋和明春扩大春洋芋作好准备。从早稻开始收割起一个月时间，全乡单是农业社内集体购买生产资料的价款总额就达九千多元。
    目前，人们正热烈地一面抓紧抢收，一面积极抢种晚秋作物，现在全乡各农业社已撒好将近一千亩田的春苕，抢种好两百多亩秋洋芋、三百多亩红萝卜和四百亩红苕藤。为了积极支援祖国工业建设，各村、各社都抽出专人忙着翻晒粮食，只等政府通知一来，就一次把“一干二净三饱满”的谷子，送进国家的仓库。
