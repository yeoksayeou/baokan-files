Xinhua News Agency, October 21st:

    The National Conference on Language Reform began its plenary session this afternoon. Language experts, teachers, education administrators, textbook editors, and writers who spoke at the meeting unanimously supported simplifying Chinese characters and promoting the common language of the Han nationality—Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation as the standard. Through their personal experiences, they illustrated the necessity of simplifying Chinese characters and promoting Putonghua.

    The representatives unanimously pointed out in their speeches that simplifying Chinese characters has become an urgent demand of the masses. Chen Shuhua, acting director of teaching affairs at the No. 2 Workers' Spare-time School in the Sixth District of Tianjin, pointed out in her speech that the shortcomings of Chinese characters have brought great difficulties to the work of eliminating illiteracy, which inevitably affects socialist construction. She said: Workers find it difficult to remember characters when learning to read, and even if they remember them, it is difficult to consolidate their knowledge, so miswritten characters are a serious problem. Because Chinese characters are divorced from the spoken language, living language cannot be fully expressed in writing. Chen Shuhua said that this year she only taught three simplified characters—尽 (jìn), 办 (bàn), 边 (biān)—in one class, and the workers were very satisfied, saying that characters that took a lot of time to memorize in the past can now be memorized with very little effort. Ren Peiding, a rural primary school teacher from Hunan Province, used many concrete examples to illustrate that with the great development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the rising cultural demands of farmers, the farmers' demand for simplified Chinese characters is even more urgent. She said that before coming to Beijing to attend the meeting, many farmers came to her to make sure she would make the meeting a success and bring back the good news of language reform. Chen Heqin, a representative from Jiangsu Province and president of Nanjing Normal College, said that some farmers in Jiangsu Province reflected after discussing the draft of the Chinese character simplification plan: with simplified Chinese characters, we can learn characters faster, and we will no longer "study every winter, starting from scratch every year." Chen Heqin said that not only the broad masses of workers and peasants and students enthusiastically support simplifying Chinese characters and promoting Putonghua, but also Shang Yanliu, an 82-year-old member of the Literary and Historical Research Institute in Nanjing and a "Tanhua" (third place in the imperial examination) during the Qing Dynasty, also supports simplifying Chinese characters and has put forward many valuable suggestions.

    Many representatives spoke about the promotion of Putonghua and the use of phonetic writing. Zheng Yun, director of teaching affairs at the No. 2 Experimental Primary School in Beijing, who has more than 30 years of teaching experience, said that the inconsistency of dialects affects work and study. She said that if Putonghua is promoted, it will be like being at home no matter where you go. Wu Diping, head of the Miao language teaching and research group at the Central Institute for Nationalities, said that students from ethnic minorities also support simplifying Chinese characters and promoting Putonghua. Recently, when teachers and students of twelve ethnic groups at the Central Institute for Nationalities discussed the promotion of Putonghua, everyone agreed that the Beijing dialect spoken by the announcers of the Central People's Broadcasting Station is easy to understand and pleasant to listen to, and this language should become the common language of the Han nationality. Students from ethnic minorities said that in the future, when we return to work in the border areas of the motherland, when we turn on the radio and hear this sound, we will think of Beijing and Chairman Mao. Wang Maoye, a primary school teacher from Dalian, used his practical experience to illustrate the benefits of phoneticizing Chinese characters. Wang Maoye once taught Latinized New Writing to fifty seven-year-old children in a first-grade class. After fifty days, half of the children could write articles in New Writing. However, under normal circumstances, using Chinese characters to teach children of the same age, only a few characters can be recognized in fifty days, and writing articles only starts in the third grade.

    The representatives all expressed their hope in their speeches that the Chinese character simplification plan would be announced and implemented as soon as possible, and that the phonetic scheme would be studied as soon as possible to use phonetic writing to help learn Putonghua. Many representatives said that they are willing to contribute their efforts to the work of language reform. Writer Lao She said: "To prove that I support the promotion of Putonghua, I am willing to do my best in terms of language use." Lao She said: "I have decided to use less local dialect in the future, but I will preserve what is worth preserving in the dialect, refine the dialect, and enrich our language. I will also create language in the future. Putonghua has great potential, which needs to be explored by writers." Chen Heqin, president of Nanjing Normal College, who began working on language reform eighteen years ago, said that only today, when the people are masters of their own affairs, can language reform be truly implemented. As a higher normal education worker, I am willing to use Nanjing Normal College as a base for promoting language reform and complete the teaching of Putonghua as an important political task.

    Since the National Conference on Language Reform opened on the 15th, it has heard reports by Wu Yuzhang, Ye Gongchuo, and Zhang Xiruo on the basic principles, steps, simplification of Chinese characters, and promotion of the common language of the Han nationality—Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation as the standard. All the representatives conducted four days of group discussions, expressed their support for the principles and guidelines put forward in the reports, and put forward several supplementary opinions and suggestions.

    全国文字改革会议开始大会发言
    一致拥护简化汉字和推广普通话
    新华社二十一日讯　全国文字改革会议今天下午开始大会发言。在会上发言的语言文字专家、教师、教育行政工作者、语文课本编辑工作者、文学家等一致拥护简化汉字和推广汉民族共同语——以北京语音为标准音的普通话；并通过切身的体验，说明简化汉字和推广普通话的必要性。
    代表们在发言中一致指出，简化汉字已成为人民群众的迫切要求。天津市第六区第二工人业余学校代理教导主任陈淑华在发言中指出，汉字的缺点给扫除文盲工作带来极大的困难，因而不能不影响到社会主义建设。她说：工人识字时不容易记住，记住了也不容易巩固，因此错别字的现象很严重。由于汉字和语言脱节，活生生的语言不能完全用文字写出来。陈淑华说，她今年在一个班里仅仅试教了三个简体字——尽、办、边，工人们便十分满意地说，过去用许多时间都没记牢的字，现在只用很少的工夫便记住了。湖南省的农村小学教师任培定用许多具体事例说明：随着互助合作运动的大发展和农民文化要求的高涨，农民对简化汉字的要求也更加迫切。她说，来北京开会前，许多农民都跑来嘱咐她一定把会开好，把文字改革的好消息带回来。江苏省代表、南京师范学院院长陈鹤琴说，江苏省有些农民讨论汉字简化方案草案后反映：汉字简化了，我们学字就快了，就不会“年年上冬学，年年从头学”了。陈鹤琴说，不仅广大的工农群众和学生们热烈拥护简化汉字和推广普通话，南京市的八十二岁的文史馆员、满清时期的“探花”商衍鎏也拥护简化汉字，并提出不少宝贵的建议。
    许多代表在发言中说到了推广普通话和使用拼音文字的问题。有三十多年教学经验的北京市第二实验小学教导主任郑芸表示，方言的不一致影响了工作和学习。她说，假如推广了普通话，无论走到那里都好像在自己家乡一样。中央民族学院苗语教研组组长吴涤平说，少数民族的学生也都拥护简化汉字和推广普通话，最近中央民族学院十二个民族的师生讨论推广普通话时，大家都认为，中央人民广播电台广播员说的北京话好懂、好听，这种话应当成为汉民族共同语。少数民族的学生们说，将来我们回到祖国的边疆工作，打开收音机一听到这种声音，就会想到北京，想到毛主席。旅大市的小学教师王茂业用他的实际经验说明，汉字拼音化的好处。王茂业曾在一年级的一个班中，向五十个年满七岁的孩子教授拉丁化新文字，五十天以后已有一半的孩子能用新文字写文章。可是，在一般情况下，用汉字教同样年龄的孩子，五十天只能认很少的字，写文章从三年级才开始。
    代表们在发言中都希望早日公布实行汉字简化方案，并尽早地研究拼音方案，用拼音文字来帮助普通话的学习。很多代表表示，愿为文字改革工作贡献出自己的力量。文学家老舍说：为了证明我拥护推广普通话，我愿从运用语言上尽我的力量。老舍说：我决定今后少用土语方言，但要把方言中值得保存的保存下来，洗炼土语，丰富我们的语言。我今后还要创造语言。普通话有很大的潜力，有待作家去发掘。十八年前就开始从事文字改革工作的南京师范学院院长陈鹤琴说，只有在人民当家作主的今天，才能真正实行文字改革。作为一个高等师范教育工作者，我愿把南京师范学院作为推行文字改革工作的阵地，并把推广普通话教学作为一个重要的政治任务来完成。
    全国文字改革会议从十五日开幕以来，已听取了吴玉章、叶恭绰、张奚若等所作的关于文字改革的基本方针、步骤、简化汉字以及推广汉民族共同语——以北京语音为标准音的普通话等报告。全体代表进行了四天的分组讨论，对报告中所提的方针、原则表示拥护，并提出了若干的补充意见和建议。
