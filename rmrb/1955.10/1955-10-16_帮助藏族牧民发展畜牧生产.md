To the Editor:

    Our animal husbandry and veterinary station in Guinan County, Qinghai Province, has established close ties with the local Tibetan herdsmen. The Tibetan herdsmen affectionately call us "Menba" (doctors) who treat livestock diseases.

    The Tibetan people of Guinan County mainly rely on animal husbandry for their livelihoods. In the old society, when livestock suffered from epidemics, no one provided treatment, and the reactionaries took the opportunity to plunder the herdsmen's livestock. Therefore, when livestock suffered from epidemics, the Tibetan people had no choice but to move their tents to "escape the plague." As a result, livestock epidemics spread for a long time.

    In 1953, the animal husbandry and veterinary station began to go deep into the Tibetan pastoral areas to carry out livestock disease prevention and control work. We helped the herdsmen improve their livestock feeding and management, and in the past two years, we helped the herdsmen build and repair 8,900 livestock enclosures, and cut and store more than 7.5 million catties of pasture and crop straw. In order to reduce the source of disease, we mobilized the herdsmen to collect more than 95,000 catties of animal bones. In addition, we also widely carried out preventive vaccinations for various livestock. If livestock were found to be sick, they were treated in a timely manner. This greatly reduced the incidence of livestock diseases and the losses due to illness and death, and powerfully promoted the development of animal husbandry production in Guinan County.

    In our work, we paid attention to using popular science education and practical observation to disseminate scientific knowledge of animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. The herdsmen did not understand why injecting anthrax vaccine could prevent anthrax, so we let them see the bacteria and vaccines first, and then explained the effect of vaccination in simple terms. The herdsmen did not pay attention to the diseases caused by external parasites, so we put lice under a microscope for the masses to see and explained the harm of parasites to livestock; the herdsmen began to pay attention to the prevention and control of external parasites.

    Our work in carrying out veterinary epidemic prevention and control in Guinan County was not very smooth at the beginning. At first, when veterinarians helped everyone prevent and control livestock diseases, the herdsmen had great doubts, and some even refused to treat their livestock. However, the actual results of our work gradually convinced the herdsmen. For example, when the veterinarian went to herdsman Niangbu Jia's home to vaccinate his livestock, he was very reluctant; in order to save face, he drove a few relatively old and weak livestock to be vaccinated. Later, some of the healthy livestock that had not been vaccinated got sick and died, but the vaccinated old and weak livestock were not affected at all. This made him and the surrounding herdsmen deeply realize the benefits of veterinary epidemic prevention and control work, and they enthusiastically welcomed veterinarians to treat their livestock.

    In the first half of this year, the animal husbandry and veterinary station also trained 56 folk veterinarians. These veterinarians have learned simple treatment techniques and can go deep into the herdsmen's communities to carry out veterinary epidemic prevention and control work, which plays a very important role. The nine Han Chinese staff members in the animal husbandry and veterinary station used to find it very inconvenient to work because of the language barrier with the local herdsmen; thanks to everyone's efforts, most of them have now learned Tibetan and can work independently without translation.

### 帮助藏族牧民发展畜牧生产

    帮助藏族牧民发展畜牧生产编辑同志：
    我们青海省贵南县畜牧兽医工作站已经同当地的藏族牧民建立了密切的联系。藏族牧民们亲切地把我们叫做给牲口治病的“门巴”（医生）。
    贵南县的藏族人民主要依靠畜牧业生活。在旧社会，牲畜发生了疫病，根本没人给治疗，反动派反而乘机大肆掠夺牧民的牲畜。因此，藏族人民在牲畜发生疫病之后，只好用搬帐房的办法来“逃瘟避灾”。这样，牲畜的疫病就长期地传布着。
    一九五三年，畜牧兽医工作站开始深入藏族牧区进行畜疫防治工作。我们帮助牧民们改进了牲畜的饲放管理工作，在去年和前年一共帮助牧民打圈、修圈八千九百个，割牧草和储存庄稼草七百五十多万斤。为了减少病源，我们发动牧民拾拣了兽骨九万五千多斤。此外，我们还广泛地替各种牲畜进行预防注射。发现牲畜有病，就及时给以治疗。这样，就大大减少了牲畜的疾病率和因病死亡的损失，有力地促进了贵南县畜牧生产的发展。
    我们在工作中注意了用通俗性的宣传和实物观察来传播畜牧兽医的科学知识。牧民们不明白注射炭疽疫苗为什么能预防炭疽病，我们就让他们先看病菌和疫苗，然后再通俗地说明打防疫针的作用。牧民们不重视外寄生虫的疫病，我们就把虱子放在显微镜下叫群众看，并说明寄生虫对牲畜的危害；牧民们就开始重视了外寄生虫的防治工作。
    我们在贵南县开展兽疫防治工作，并不是一开始就很顺利的。最初，当兽医帮助大家给牲口防治疫病的时候，牧民们的疑虑很大，有的甚至拒绝给牲口治疗。但是，我们工作的实际效果使牧民们逐渐相信了我们。例如，牧民娘布佳在兽医到他家里去给牲口进行预防注射时，他很不愿意；为了应付面子，就赶了几只比较老弱的牲畜来注射防疫针。后来，没有打针的健壮牲畜有的害病死了，打了针的老弱牲畜却一点没有受病。这一下他和周围的牧民们就深深认识到兽疫防治工作的好处，以后都热情地欢迎兽医们给牲口治病。
    畜牧兽医工作站在今年上半年还培养了民间兽医五十六人。这些兽医学会了简单的治疗技术，就能深入牧民群众进行兽疫防治工作，起的作用很大。畜牧兽医工作站中的九名汉族工作人员，过去因为同当地牧民语言隔阂而工作很不方便；由于大家的努力，现在大部分人都学会了藏语，不要翻译也能够单独进行工作了。
