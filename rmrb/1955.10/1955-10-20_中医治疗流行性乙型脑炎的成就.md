Achievements of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Treating Epidemic Japanese Encephalitis
Assistant Minister of Health, Guo Zihua

In mid-August of this year, I was ordered by the Ministry of Health to lead an inspection team composed of both Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to Shijiazhuang City to inspect the situation of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in treating epidemic Japanese encephalitis, and to examine the teaching work of the short-term training class for treating Japanese encephalitis. Based on the materials obtained through discussions, interviews, and clinical observations, the inspection team affirmed that the twenty cases treated by TCM in Shijiazhuang Infectious Disease Hospital this year were definitely patients with epidemic Japanese encephalitis, and the treatment effect was extremely high.

The twenty cases treated by TCM in Shijiazhuang all had distinct characteristics of Japanese encephalitis. The onset of epidemic Japanese encephalitis is seasonal. According to domestic reports, the three months of July, August, and September are the most prevalent. The onset period of the twenty patients treated in Shijiazhuang this year is consistent with this. The patients included men, women, children, and the elderly, with the youngest being six months old and the oldest being sixty-one years old, indicating that the disease is not limited to certain ages or genders. The symptoms are mostly sudden high fever, headache, vomiting, convulsions, lethargy, irritability, and delirium. Physical signs generally do not show any special changes, and individual patients have complications. Neurological and mental aspects include coma, stiff neck, disappearance of superficial reflexes such as abdominal wall and cremasteric reflexes, positive Kernig's sign, positive Brudzinski's sign, and pathological reflexes such as the appearance of Babinski's sign. In blood tests, it was found that most patients had an increase in white blood cells to 10,000 to 20,000 per cubic millimeter, with an increase in segmented neutrophils in the differential count. The results of cerebrospinal fluid examination were: clear appearance, an increase in cell count to between 10 and 500 per cubic millimeter, positive protein, and normal sugar levels. Serological examination: The results of the serum encephalitis complement fixation test in some cases were positive. In addition, patients with sequelae accounted for 15%; generally, after the patient's body temperature returned to normal, brain symptoms and signs gradually disappeared (excluding sequelae), and the prognosis could be determined in about ten days. The above-mentioned phenomena are all consistent with the symptoms of epidemic Japanese encephalitis.

Epidemic Japanese encephalitis is a highly infectious disease. In 1952, the Central Ministry of Health designated this disease as a statutory infectious disease and standardized its name as "Epidemic Japanese Encephalitis." Prior to this, the name of this disease was very inconsistent, with some calling it Japanese encephalitis B, others calling it summer-autumn encephalitis, and generally calling it cerebral encephalitis. This disease is very harmful to people's health. According to reports from various places, approximately 30 to 50 out of every 100 severe patients die from this disease, and even if they are fortunate enough to survive, they often leave behind sequelae such as inability to speak, mental disorders, dementia, hemiplegia, and impaired memory and intelligence. This disease is transmitted by mosquitoes. When mosquitoes bite people or animals suffering from this disease, they absorb a filterable virus from the blood of the patient or livestock, and then bite healthy people, which will cause the healthy people to contract Japanese encephalitis. This filterable virus has an extremely high affinity for the nervous system, invading the patient's brain and central nervous system tissues, causing lesions such as degeneration and necrosis.

Currently, Western medicine does not have a specific treatment for this highly infectious disease, and prevention is mainly carried out from a proactive perspective. Since liberation, the People's Government has mobilized the masses to prevent and eliminate mosquitoes and vaccinated children against encephalitis to prevent the occurrence of this infectious disease. Western medicine's treatment for Japanese encephalitis is mainly symptomatic, applying general treatments and nursing. For example, if a patient has a high fever, cold compresses are applied, warm water and alcohol are used to wipe the body, or diaphoretic and antipyretic drugs are used to help reduce the fever; anticonvulsant drugs are given for convulsions; when the patient is in a coma, oxygen is only administered for respiratory and circulatory failure, or drugs that stimulate respiration and circulation are given. In recent years, although plasma therapy and immune serum therapy have slightly reduced the mortality rate of patients, the treatment effect is still not high, and the broad masses of people have not been relieved of the threat of this terrible disease.

Thirty years ago, Japan created the name of Japanese encephalitis and summarized its symptoms and symptomatic treatment. After that, many people in our country believed that China had never had encephalitis, and if it did, it was brought in from abroad. However, this is not the case. Chinese medical literature has recorded this disease very early, and our predecessors have developed relatively complete treatment methods in the long-term struggle against this highly infectious disease, only the name of the disease is different in TCM. TCM calls epidemic Japanese encephalitis Summer-Heat Pestilence (or Hidden Summer-Heat, Summer-Heat Wind, Summer-Heat Collapse). Our country's febrile diseases were discussed as early as the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 264 AD) and in earlier works such as the Inner Canon, the Difficult Classic, and Zhang Zhongjing's "Treatise on Febrile Diseases." By the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there were more specialized treatises, such as Wu Youke's "Treatise on Pestilence," Wu Jutong's "Systematic Differentiation of Warm Diseases," and Ye Tianshi, Chen Pingbo, Xue Shengbai, etc. continuously enriched their content; the works of Yu Shiyu, Gu Songyuan, Wang Mengying, Wu Zhibu, etc. concentrated the rich clinical experience of TCM in treating warm-heat diseases, especially Summer-Heat Pestilence.

The main basis for the treatment of Japanese encephalitis by TCM in Shijiazhuang is the medical part of Yu Shiyu's "Experience in Treating Epidemic Rashes" related to Summer-Heat Pestilence. The basic principle of treating Summer-Heat Pestilence is to clear heat, detoxify, and nourish yin. Although TCM does not know the filterable virus, it vaguely points out from argumentation that an external toxin (Summer-Heat Evil - Noxious Qi) invades the human body, causing the patient to develop a fever. TCM first clears heat in treatment. The main medicines used in decoctions, pills, and powders are Qingwen Baidu Decoction, Baihu Decoction, Rhinoceros Horn and Rehmannia Decoction, Angong Niuhuang Pill, Jufang Zhibao Dan, Zixue Dan, Suhexiang Pill, and Zhijing San. Among them, the medicines of the acrid-cool clearing and detoxifying category include raw gypsum, Southern honeysuckle, forsythia, bamboo leaves, and artemisia annua; the aromatic-transforming dampness category includes agastache, patchouli, and turmeric; the orifice-opening category includes rhinoceros horn, antelope horn, musk, and bezoar; the liver-calming and wind-extinguishing category includes whole scorpion, centipede, uncaria, earthworm, Lonicera japonica vine, and Jiang Can; the yin-nourishing category includes raw rehmannia, scrophularia, ophiopogon, anemarrhena, trichosanthes, and raw white peony. These medicines are mainly acrid-cool, clearing heat and detoxifying, and guiding the evil out. In the later stage of the disease, attention is paid to nourishing yin, which is to increase the body's resistance and allow the patient to recover health as soon as possible. TCM does not focus solely on the virus in treatment, but starts from the whole, considering both the patient's physical condition, the development of the disease and other internal conditions, as well as external conditions such as seasonal climate and living environment, closely combining with the changes in the condition to determine treatment measures. The types and dosages of medicines are also increased or decreased according to the changes in the condition.

From the actual effect of TCM's treatment of patients in Shijiazhuang City in 1954 and this year, the above-mentioned TCM treatment methods for Japanese encephalitis have a very high curative effect. From July 4th to August 22nd this year, Shijiazhuang Infectious Disease Hospital treated twenty patients with Japanese encephalitis with TCM, of which nine were extremely severe patients, and eight severe and mild patients have been cured, with only three patients dying. Among the three deceased patients, the symptoms of encephalitis had obviously lessened before one of them died. After checking the medical records, there was a confirmed record of otitis media, but it was not treated concurrently. Therefore, this patient obviously died of otitis media sepsis. The causes of death of the other two patients are still to be analyzed and studied. Even with the two deaths, the cure rate of TCM in Shijiazhuang for Japanese encephalitis has reached 90%. In 1954, TCM in Shijiazhuang City treated thirty-one patients with Japanese encephalitis, more than half of whom were extremely severe, and none died, with a cure rate of 100%. Such a high curative effect cannot be found in foreign medical literature.

Although TCM has such a high curative effect in treating Japanese encephalitis, in the past, due to the fact that the Party's TCM policy has not been better implemented, the emotions of distrust and even discrimination against TCM in practical work and in the thinking of some Western medicine practitioners are quite serious, therefore, the power of TCM has not been fully utilized. Since the Ministry of Health designated epidemic Japanese encephalitis as a statutory infectious disease (this regulation is necessary and correct), patients with Japanese encephalitis have entered hospitals. However, in the past, there were no TCM practitioners participating in hospitals, which invisibly limited TCM's treatment of this disease. Therefore, some problems were exposed in the process of TCM treating this disease in Shijiazhuang and in the teaching work of the short-term training class for treating Japanese encephalitis. For example, some Western medicine practitioners initially adopted a skeptical or negative attitude when faced with the indisputable objective fact of TCM treatment of Japanese encephalitis. They always liked to use modern scientific knowledge to question and challenge TCM, and were unwilling to learn with humility, which hindered the cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine. We say that in terms of treatment and diagnosis, if Western medicine has any doubts, it is perfectly reasonable to adopt a questioning attitude in order to pursue the truth. However, if the fact that TCM treatment of Japanese encephalitis has an extremely high curative effect is ignored, and it is denied simply because TCM cannot explain it theoretically for a while, then this is not a realistic attitude. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that practice is the criterion of truth. The curative effect of TCM in treating Japanese encephalitis has been proven by practice. We should first affirm this curative effect, and then study the reasons behind it. We should adopt this attitude towards the entire national medicine. First, humbly learn this heritage, accept it all, and then use modern scientific knowledge to sort it out and improve it, and better use it to serve the people's health care cause.

Although TCM in Shijiazhuang has achieved great results in treating Japanese encephalitis, some problems, especially in the aspect of medical theory, still need to be further studied and resolved jointly by Chinese and Western medicine practitioners. For example, Western medicine believes that Japanese encephalitis virus is a neurotropic virus, it only exists in the brain and nervous system, it only invades nerve cells, and does not invade other parts; TCM believes that it is unimaginable that the virus only invades the cerebral cortex and does not invade other parts. In terms of treatment, Chinese and Western medicine also have some different views. Western medicine advocates using ice packs for cold compresses during high fever, and using sleeping pills and sedatives during convulsions, while TCM resolutely opposes it. Western medicine uses lumbar puncture to draw spinal cord fluid for diagnosis, and although TCM reluctantly agrees to this in order to diagnose the disease, it believes that lumbar puncture is very harmful to the patient in treatment. Western medicine believes that supplementing the patient's nutrition can enhance resistance to the virus; TCM does not greatly oppose intravenous fluids, but resolutely opposes giving meat and fish foods, believing that this will help heat and nourish toxins. They believe that if the patient is not given intravenous nutrition within a few days and there is the support of yin-nourishing medicines, the patient will have sufficient resistance. Western medicine has great doubts about the effect of gypsum in TCM on treating encephalitis, saying "the chemical composition of gypsum is calcium sulfate, which is insoluble in water"; TCM believes that it has the effect of penetrating the exterior and relieving muscles. As for whether gypsum neutralizes the virus, eliminates the virus, or has other effects, it is not yet known. TCM has four major contraindications when treating this disease: avoid sweating, avoid purging, avoid diuretics, and avoid acrid, dry, stimulating, and exciting drugs; when cooperating with Western medicine in treatment, it also adds avoid sleeping pills, sedatives, and ice packs for cold compresses. These problems are some problems with fundamental principles in treatment. It is hoped that Chinese and Western medicine practitioners will further conduct in-depth practical tests and laboratory research on the premise of affirming the curative effect, so as to explain and demonstrate it with modern scientific knowledge, so that our country's medicine can be more enriched and complete. This is the glorious task of every medical worker.

    中医治疗流行性乙型脑炎的成就 
    卫生部部长助理　郭子化
    今年八月中旬，我奉卫生部的命令，带领一个由中西医共同组成的视察组到石家庄市视察中医治疗流行性乙型脑炎的情形，同时考察治疗乙型脑炎短期训练班的教学工作。根据座谈、访问和临床观察所得到的材料，视察组肯定地认为：石家庄传染病医院中医今年治疗的二十个病例，完全是流行性乙型脑炎病患者，而且治疗效果是极高的。
    石家庄中医治疗的二十个病例，都具有鲜明的乙型脑炎特征。流行性乙型脑炎的发病是有季节性的。根据国内报告材料，以每年七、八、九三个月为最多。石家庄市今年治疗的二十个病人的发病期是与此相符的。患病者包括有男性、女性、幼儿和老年人，发病年龄最小的是六个月，最高的是六十一岁，这说明疾病是不专限于某些年龄、性别的。病症表现多为突发高热、头疼、呕吐、抽风、嗜睡、烦燥、谵妄等。体征一般没有什么特殊变化，个别病人有合并症；神经和精神方面有神志昏迷、颈部僵直、腹壁、提睾等浅层反射消失、克匿氏征阳性、金斯基氏征阳性、病理反射如巴彬斯奇氏征出现等现象。在血液检查中，发现大部分病人白血球增加到每立方毫米一万到二万，分类中显中性分节核白血球增加。脑脊髓液检查的结果是：外观澄清，细胞数增加到每立方毫米十到五百之间，蛋白阳性，糖量正常。血清学检查：部分病例血清脑炎补体结合试验的结果，呈阳性反应。此外，病人有后遗症者占百分之十五；一般患者体温恢复正常后，脑系症状及征候逐渐消失（后遗症除外），十天左右即可决定预后。上述种种现象，都同流行性乙型脑炎症状符合。
    流行性乙型脑炎是一种烈性传染病。中央卫生部于一九五二年把这种病规定为法定传染病，并将这种病的名称规定为“流行性乙型脑炎”。在这以前，这种病的名称很不统一，有称它为日本乙型脑炎的，也有称为夏秋季脑炎的，一般称为大脑炎。这种病对人民的健康危害很大。根据各地报告材料来看，得这种病的人，大约每百个重型病人中，就有三十甚至五十几个要死去，即使幸而不死，也往往留下不会说话、精神失常、痴呆、偏瘫、记忆力和智力减退等后遗症。这种病是由蚊子传染的。蚊子咬了患这种病的人或动物，就吸收了病人或病畜血液中的一种滤过性病毒，再咬健康的人，就会使健康的人患乙型脑炎。这种滤过性病毒和神经系统的亲和力极高，它侵犯病人的脑及中枢神经系统的组织，致发生变性和坏死等病变。
    对于这种烈性传染病，目前西医还没有特效的治疗方法，主要是从积极方面加以预防。解放以来，人民政府为了预防这种传染病的发生，曾发动群众防蚊灭蚊，并给儿童接种脑炎疫苗。西医对于乙型脑炎的治疗，主要是对症施用一般的治疗和护理。如病人发高热即施以冷敷，用温水和酒精擦澡，或用发汗和退烧药，帮助退烧；抽风时给以镇痉药物；病人昏迷时，只能针对呼吸和循环衰竭的现象输以氧气或给以兴奋呼吸和循环的药物等。近年来，虽有血浆疗法和免疫血清治疗，使病人死亡率稍有降低，但治疗效果仍然是不高的，广大人民并未解除这种可怕疾病的威胁。
    三十年前，日本创出乙型脑炎的病名，并且总结了它的症状和对症疗法。这以后，我国有很多人认为中国一向没有脑炎，就是有，也是由外国移来的。其实不然。中国医学文献中很早就有这种疾病的记载，并且我们的前人在长期同这种烈性传染病的斗争中，已有了较完善的治疗方法，只不过是中医对这种疾病的名称叫法不同而已。中医称流行性乙型脑炎为暑瘟病（或名伏暑、暑风、暑厥）。我国的热性病早在汉代（公元前二○六——公元二六四）及其以前的内经、难经和张仲景所著“伤寒论”都曾论及。到了明代、清代更有了专门的论著，如吴又可著“瘟疫论”，吴鞠通著“温病条辨”，叶天士、陈平伯、薛生白等又不断充实其内容；余师愚、顾松园、王孟英、吴芝甫等人的著述，更集中了中医治疗温热病特别是暑瘟病的丰富的临床经验。
    石家庄中医对于乙型脑炎的治疗方法，主要的根据是余师愚所著“疫疹一得”书中有关暑瘟病的医疗部分。其治疗暑瘟的基本方针是清热、解毒、养阴。中医虽不知道滤过性病毒，但从论证上已隐约指出有一种外毒（暑邪——戾气）侵入人体，而致病人发热。中医在治疗上首先是清热。所采用的药物，主要汤剂丸散为清瘟败毒饮白虎汤，犀角地黄汤，安宫牛黄散，局方至宝丹，紫雪丹，苏合香丸，止痉散等。其中药物辛凉清解类有生石膏，南银花，连翘，竹叶，青蒿等；芳香化浊类如佩兰，藿香，郁金等；通灵开窍类有犀角，羚羊角，麝香，牛黄等；镇肝、息风类有全蝎，蜈蚣，钩藤，地龙，忍冬藤，姜蚕等；养阴类有生地，元参，麦冬，知母，天花粉，生白芍等。这些药物以辛凉为主，清温解毒，导邪外出。在病的后期，注重养阴，就是增加人的身体的抵抗力，使病人早日恢复健康。中医在治疗中不是单纯从病毒上着眼，而是从整体出发，在治疗中既考虑到患者身体虚实、病情发展等内在条件，也考虑到季节气候、生活环境等外在条件，紧密地结合病情变化，确定治疗措施。药物种类、剂量也随病情变化有所增减。
    上述中医治疗乙型脑炎的方法，从石家庄市中医在一九五四年和今年治疗病人的实际效果来看，疗效是很高的。石家庄市传染病医院今年七月四日到八月二十二日，中医治疗了二十个乙型脑炎病人，其中有九名极重型的病人、八名重型和轻型病人都已经治好，只有三名病人死亡。这三个死亡的病人中，一个在死前脑炎病状已明显见轻。经检查病历，见有确凿的中耳炎记载，但未兼治。因此，这个病人显然是死于中耳炎败血症。另外两个病人的死因尚待分析研究。姑且以两个死亡病例计，石家庄中医治疗乙型脑炎的治愈率已达到百分之九十。一九五四年石家庄市中医治了三十一个乙型脑炎患者，其中极重型的病人占半数以上，无一死亡，治愈率达百分之百。这样高的疗效，目前在外国的医学文献中是找不到的。
    中医治疗乙型脑炎虽有如此高的疗效，可是，过去由于党的中医政策没有更好地贯彻执行，在实际工作以及在某些西医的思想中，不信任甚至歧视中医的情绪是相当严重的，因而，中医的力量一直没有得到充分发挥。自卫生部将流行性乙型脑炎规定为法定传染病后（这规定是必要的。也是正确的），乙型脑炎患者都进了医院。但过去医院中并无中医参加，无形中就限制了中医对这种病的治疗。所以在石家庄中医治疗这种病的过程中及治疗乙型脑炎短期训练班教学工作中，也就暴露了一些问题。例如某些西医面对中医治疗乙型脑炎这一无可置辩的客观事实，最初也是采取怀疑或否定的态度。他们总喜欢用现代科学知识来向中医质疑问难，不愿虚心学习，这都是妨碍中西医合作的。我们说，在治疗、诊断方面，西医如果有任何怀疑，为了追求真理而采取寻根究底的态度，这是完全应该的。但是，如果不顾中医治疗乙型脑炎有着极高的疗效这一事实，仅仅因为中医一时还不能从理论上说明，就加以否定，这就不是实事求是的态度了。毛泽东同志教导我们说：实践是真理的标准。中医治疗乙型脑炎的疗效，是已经为实践证明了的。我们应当首先肯定这种疗效，然后再研究这里面的道理。对整个祖国医学也应当采取这种态度。首先虚心地学习这份遗产，把它全部接受过来，然后再用现代科学知识加以整理和提高，更好地运用它来为人民的保健事业服务。
    石家庄中医治疗乙型脑炎虽然取得了重大成绩，但有些问题特别是医学理论方面的问题，还需要中西医共同努力进一步研究解决。如西医认为乙型脑炎病毒是一种嗜神经性病毒，它只存在于脑及神经系，只侵犯神经细胞，不侵犯其他部分；中医则认为病毒既侵犯了大脑皮质，而不侵犯其他部分是不可想像的。在治疗方面，中西医也有些不同的看法。西医主张在高热的时候就用冰袋冷敷，痉挛的时候用安眠镇静剂，中医则坚决反对。西医诊断的时候要用腰椎穿刺的方法抽脊髓，中医为了诊断这种病虽然勉强同意，但认为腰椎穿刺在治疗中对病人有很大危害。西医认为补充病员营养，可以增强对病毒的抵抗力；中医对输水输盐虽不大反对，但坚决反对给荤腥食物，认为这会助热资毒。他们认为，在数日内如不给病人输营养而有养阴药的支持，病人即有足用的抵抗力。西医对中药石膏治疗脑炎的作用，有很大怀疑，说“石膏的化学成份是硫酸钙，不溶于水”；中医则认为它有透表解肌的作用。至于石膏究竟是中和病毒，还是驱除病毒，或有其他作用，目前还不知道。中医在治疗这种病的时候，有四大禁忌：忌发汗、忌泻下、忌利小便、忌辛燥刺激兴奋的药物；在同西医合作治疗的时候，又增加了忌安眠镇静剂，忌冰袋冷敷等。这些问题在治疗上都是一些带有原则性的问题，希望中西医师在肯定疗效的前提下，进一步深入地作实践检验和实验室的研究，以便用现代科学知识来解释它、论证它，从而使我们祖国的医学更加丰富完备。这是每个医务工作者的光荣任务。
