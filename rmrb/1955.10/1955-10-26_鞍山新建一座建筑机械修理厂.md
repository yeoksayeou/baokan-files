    New Construction Machinery Repair Plant Built in Anshan
    The newly built construction machinery repair plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company was put into production in early October.
    This construction machinery repair plant is specifically built for repairing all internal combustion construction machinery of Anshan Iron and Steel, such as excavators, tractors, and automobiles. The factory building is designed according to Soviet standards and has twenty-six workshops. All production processes are specialized. In addition to dozens of ordinary machine tools, the factory is equipped with various precision mechanical equipment for making specialized mechanical parts, such as crankshaft grinders, gear shapers, and cylindrical grinders. According to the original design, this factory can repair 500 automobiles a year, with an average of one and a half automobiles being repaired and leaving the factory every day.
    In recent years, the mechanization of construction in Anshan has developed rapidly. The total number of construction machinery in 1955 has reached ten times that of 1952. In the past, due to the lack of a sound repair plant, many machines were broken and could not be repaired for a long time. The commissioning of this repair plant provides favorable conditions for the further development of mechanized construction. Not only can various heavy and complex construction machinery be repaired by this factory, but also more precise automobile and mechanical parts can be manufactured by this factory. (Feng Shiming)

    鞍山新建一座建筑机械修理厂
    鞍山钢铁建设公司新建的建筑机械修理厂在十月上旬投入生产。
    这座建筑机械修理厂是专为修理鞍钢所有内燃建筑机械——挖土机、拖拉机、汽车等而修建的。厂房按照苏联标准设计，拥有二十六个工作间。各项生产工序全部专业化。厂房设备除数十台普通机床外，还有各种精密的专制机械零件的机械设备，如曲轴磨床、插齿床、外圆磨床等。按照原设计规定，这座工厂一年可以修理五百台汽车，平均每天可有一台半汽车修复出厂。
    几年来，鞍山施工机械化发展很快，一九五五年建筑机械的总数，已达到一九五二年的十倍。过去由于缺乏健全的修理工厂，许多机械坏了长期不能修复。这座修理厂的投入生产，为进一步发展机械化施工提供了有利的条件。不仅各种重型复杂建筑机械可以由这座工厂修理，一般较精密的汽车和机械零件也可以由这座工厂制造。（冯世明）
