To the Editor:

    In many villages in the Zhangjiakou Special District, farmers have to worry a lot about drinking water. Take Citiding, a small village in the Ninth District of Chicheng County, for example. All 78 households, with more than 340 people, rely on taking every drop of flowing water from a small stone crevice a mile away for drinking and daily use. If there is a drought, the water in the crevice dries up, and the farmers have to cross mountains and ridges to carry water from Mangniu Gully, five miles away. Carrying water twice a day will delay work for a day. Therefore, local farmers cherish drinking water more than cooking oil. At the beginning of 1954, Comrade Zhong Zhankui, a well-watching technician from the Special Commissioner's Office Water Conservancy Bureau, came to this village. He spent two days locating a well in the middle of the village, and as a result, water was struck. This made all the people in the village overjoyed.

    Zhong Zhankui was originally a peasant who only attended elementary school for a few years. Seeing the difficulty farmers had in obtaining drinking water, he was determined to relieve the masses of this suffering. Therefore, he actively studied in practice and found a set of scientific well-digging experiences. In the winter of 1951, he worked in Heilongshan Village, Baicao District, Chicheng County. At that time, the People's Government called for the development of water conservancy to turn dry land into paddy fields. Heilongshan Village had the task of digging wells, but because there were no technicians, the farmers were afraid that digging wells would not yield water and would be a waste of manpower and money. Zhong Zhankui thought, "Trees have roots, and water must have a source." So he ran around the village for two or three days, and finally found a clear spring at the foot of the Xiaoshiyaogou slope. He saw that the terrain in this area was high in the inner part and low in the outer part, and the water must be flowing westward, so he decided to dig a well behind the Dashiwang at the west end of the village. When digging, the farmers were very worried, and he himself was also very nervous. As a result, water came out before digging to a depth of 25 chi. So the village dug nine more wells according to his judgment, and all of them yielded water.

    Since then, he has continued to learn from practical life, and finally overcome many difficulties, and explored a relatively systematic set of well-watching experience. For example, he mastered the seasonal characteristics of well-watching: in places with water, the grass withers late in autumn and sprouts early in spring; if there is hot air rising in the shady places where the sun does not shine in the winter morning, there is water; for example, when determining the water source, if the mountain has vertical cracks, the water layer is deep, if the mountain has horizontal cracks, the water layer is shallow, if the ground is red sandstone, the water is shallower, and if the ground is white limestone, there is no water. From 1952 to July of this year, he used these experiences to help more than 50 villages in five counties including Chicheng, Guyuan, and Longguan dig 148 wells, solving the drinking water problem for more than 20,000 people, and also expanding the irrigated area by more than 1,000 mu.

    Comrade Zhong Zhankui is busy working to solve the problem of water shortage for farmers in mountainous areas. Everyone affectionately calls him a "well-watching expert." Cheng Wanmin

### 受山区农民欢迎的一个“看井专家”

    受山区农民欢迎的一个“看井专家”编辑同志：
    在张家口专区的不少村庄里，农民为吃水问题要操很大的心。像赤城县九区茨顶这个小村，全村七十八户，三百四十多口人，全靠到一里地以外的一个小石缝里去取一点一滴的流水来吃用；如果天一旱，石缝里水就干了，农民还得翻山越岭到五里地以外的牤牛沟去驮水，一天驮两趟就得误一个工。所以当地农民吃水比吃油都珍惜。一九五四年年初，专署水利局看井技术员锺占魁同志来到这村，他花了两天的时间，在村子当中给看了一面井，结果就打出水来了。这可把全村的人都乐坏了。
    锺占魁原来是个庄稼汉，只念过几年小学。他看到了农民吃水困难，立志要为群众解除这个痛苦，因此在实际工作中积极钻研，才摸到了一套合乎科学的打井经验。一九五一年冬季，他在赤城县白草区黑龙山村工作。这时人民政府号召开发水利，把旱地变水田。黑龙山村就有打井的任务，但是因为没有技术人员，农民们都怕打井不出水，劳民伤财。锺占魁想：“树有根，水一定有源。”于是在村子周围跑了两三天，最后在小石窑沟坡下发现有一个明水泉眼。他看到这一带的地势是里高外低，水一定是向西流的，因此就决定在村子西头的大石王后身打一眼井。在打的时候，农民们都很担心，他心里也是七上八下的。结果，打不到两丈五尺深，就出了水。于是这个村里又照他的判断打了九眼井，也都出了水。
    在这以后，他又不断地从实践生活中学习，终于克服了许许多多的困难，摸索出一套比较系统的看井经验。比如他掌握了看井的季节特点，有水的地方秋天草枯死晚、春天草发芽早，冬天早晨太阳照不着的背阴地方如果有热气上升就有水；又如，确定水源时，山是立缝水层就深，山是卧缝水层便浅，地面是红沙石水更浅，地面是白灰石就没有水。从一九五二年到今年七月，他运用这些经验，就帮助赤城、沽源、龙关等五个县约五十多个村子打了一百四十八眼井，解决了二万多人的吃水问题，而且还扩大浇地面积一千多亩。
    锺占魁同志日日奔忙地为山区农民解决缺水的困难而工作着。大家都亲切地叫他是“看井专家”。　程万民
