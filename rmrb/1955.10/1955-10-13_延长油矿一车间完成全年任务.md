Yan Chang Oil Mine's Yongping Oil Extraction Workshop completed its annual crude oil production plan 108 days ahead of schedule as of September 14.

The main reasons for achieving the above results are, first of all, that the Party organization strengthened the political and ideological education of the workers. Through various political movements, it stimulated and improved the labor enthusiasm of all workers; and at the beginning of the year and each month, after conscientiously implementing the state plan, all workers were clear about the goals, laying an ideological foundation for completing the annual plan; at the same time, the suggestions of Soviet experts were earnestly implemented.

This year, more than 100 new oil wells were drilled in Yongping. Its output accounts for 21.68% of the total output. Some achievements have also been made in terms of production increase measures. For example, after a certain well was blasted, its output increased by 12.5 times, which played a decisive role in the completion of the plan.

    延长油矿一车间完成全年任务
    延长油矿永坪采油车间，截至九月十四日止提前一百零八天完成全年原油生产计划。
    取得以上成绩的主要原因，首先是党组织加强了对职工的政治思想教育工作，通过各项政治运动，激发和提高了全体职工的劳动热情；并在年初和每月初，经过认真地贯彻国家计划，使全体职工做到心中有数，给完成全年计划打下了思想基础；同时认真执行了苏联专家建议。
    今年永坪新钻了一百多口油井。它的产量占总产量的百分之二十一点六八。在增产措施方面，也取得了一些成绩。如某井经爆炸以后，产量提高十二点五倍，这对计划的完成起了决定性作用。
