    Nanyang Silk Weaving Factory Improves Product Quality
    The production costs of the Henan Provincial State-owned Nanyang Silk Weaving Factory have gradually decreased and the quality of its products has steadily improved over the past year. The factory's products include the domestically and internationally renowned tussah silk fabric, Nanyang Silk, which is strong and durable with bright colors and can be used to make beautiful clothing, headscarves, curtains, and bedsheets. Recently, the factory successfully trial-produced new products such as Wanxin Serge, Fushan Serge, and Wax Thread Feather Yarn, which are very popular among the masses. The high-quality silk fabrics are sold throughout the country, as well as exported to the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries. After the factory's workers launched a campaign to conserve resources and study local industrial policies in early May this year, raw material consumption was reduced by 47%, eliminating the waste of approximately 5 kilograms of small knot silk per day, and improving the silk yield from cocoons. At the same time, the adoption of advanced work methods such as frequent inspections, timely patrols, and removal of fluff and knots in the power weaving workshop reduced the number of defective products. The production of first-class silk in August increased by 15% compared to July. The cost of each bolt of silk is now more than half of what it was in 1953. In August alone, the factory exceeded its profit target by more than 5,000 yuan.
    The Nanyang Silk Weaving Factory is located near the Funiu and Tongbai Mountains in Henan Province, which are rich in tussah silkworms. Therefore, the supply of silk raw materials is extremely convenient. Since the factory was built and put into production in 1951, it has accumulated considerable capital for the country. At present, Henan Province has decided to expand the factory in the first Five-Year Plan in order to weave better and more silk to support national economic construction and meet the needs of the people's lives.

    南阳丝织厂产品质量提高
    河南省地方国营南阳丝织厂一年来生产成本逐渐下降，品质日有改进。这个厂的产品有驰名国内外的柞蚕丝织品——南阳绸，质地坚韧，色彩鲜艳，可做漂亮的服装、头巾、窗帘、床单。最近这个厂又试织成功了宛新呢、伏山呢、腊线羽纱等新产品，很受广大群众欢迎。用甲等丝织的绸料，除在祖国各地销售外，并外销苏联和人民民主国家。今年五月上旬这个厂的职工在开展节约和学习地方工业方针以后，使原料消耗降低了百分之四十七，消灭了每日约五公斤小辫丝的浪费，提高了蚕茧出丝率。同时在力织车间推广了勤检查、及时巡回、拉掉毛尾、疙瘩等先进工作法后，减少了次品。八月份出产的甲等绸比七月份增加了百分之十五。现在每匹丝绸的成本比一九五三年降低了一半以上。仅八月份就超额完成了五千多元的上缴利润计划。
    南阳丝织厂靠近河南盛产柞蚕的伏牛山和桐柏山麓。因此丝绸原料的来路极为便利。这个厂自一九五一年建成投入生产后，已给国家积累了不少资金。目前河南省在第一个五年计划中已确定扩建这个厂，以便能织出更好更多的丝绸，支援国家经济建设和满足人民生活需要。（本报驻郑州记者）
