    The Warrior Who Never Retreats
    Tan Tian
    In May 1952, demobilized soldier Li Yuchang returned to his hometown—Xiaochang Township, Bianli Street, Wenshan County, Yunnan Province.

    Tall mountains, clear streams, and boundless green wheat fields, like strips of green velvet carpets. People were happily working on the land they had been allocated, and joyful songs of the mutual aid group's young men and women rose again in the fields. How beautiful his hometown, which had suffered so much pain and humiliation in the past, had become!

    Li Yuchang stared for a long time, a surge of emotion churning in his chest: "Let me use my own hands to build my hometown even better!" But when he lowered his head, he felt a little discouraged. He saw his own hands without fingers! In 1947, during the most difficult period of the Northeast Liberation War, in the freezing cold of minus forty degrees Celsius, he fought fiercely with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops alongside his unit, and all his fingers and toes were frozen off.

    The organization was very concerned and took good care of him.

    Township Head (Party Branch Secretary) Guo Yonggui came to see him and said with concern:

    "Comrade Li Yuchang, try to do less heavy work, and don't let the wounds reopen. If there are difficulties in production, the government and the masses will help you."

    "How can I do that?" Li Yuchang felt the warmth of the Party and the government like a loving mother, but at the same time, he thought that he must continue to contribute to the revolution. He could not "sit and wait for the flowers to bloom" and only rely on government relief!

    The people from the mutual aid group went up the mountain to work, and their songs were transmitted over the hills, singing about the happiness of the new China today and the brilliant prospects of socialism!

    "Am I going to enter socialist society empty-handed? Am I going to sit on other people's shoulders and let them carry me as a burden into socialist society?" Li Yuchang gazed from his doorway, pondering his future work.

    "No, I can't go on like this! Communists never lag behind!" He remembered a conversation with the political commissar and made up his mind.

    The next day, he drove the ox, carrying the plow, and appeared on the land that the masses had originally been tilling for him.

    "Oh my, why are you here! Your hands and feet are so clumsy, how can you work?" The masses discussed animatedly.

    "I will do my best as long as I have a bit of strength. I can't sit around and eat for nothing!" Li Yuchang answered calmly.

    He insisted on having someone tie his right hand to the plow handle, and then wrapped the cow rope around his left hand. Like a child learning to walk, he stumbled and began to plow. Li Yuchang was originally from a farming family and was used to using a plow. Before liberation, when he worked for the wealthy, how many oxen he had commanded! Even the most stubborn ox became docile under his hands. But now the ox didn't listen to him, and the plow crawled crookedly across the field, and the plowshare couldn't dig into the soil. Li Yuchang flushed red, and beads of sweat rolled down his forehead. The masses all advised him: "Forget it, don't bother, we won't treat you unfairly!"

    "Folks, what are you talking about? Do you think I'm afraid you'll treat me unfairly? I'm doing my duty!" Li Yuchang said as he lifted the plow again.

    Li Yuchang, like capturing enemy bunkers one by one in battle, treated each ridge of the field as his battle goal. If his hands couldn't exert strength, he leaned his whole body on the plow handle, using his waist to control it. The furrows gradually became straight, but his jacket was also soaked through.

    The ox also seemed to be listening slowly, obediently pulling the plowshare to turn over the brown, fresh soil. But after all, it felt that the one commanding it was not a pair of strong hands, and the force controlling it was getting weaker and weaker. So, this naughty animal became disobedient, and suddenly pulled the rope and plow handle from Li Yuchang's hands. The wound burst open, and Li Yuchang was in so much pain that he felt dizzy.

    After returning home, his newlywed wife said anxiously.

    "I told you not to go, but you insisted on going, look at you..." His wife couldn't help but blame him.

    Late at night, his eyes could no longer close. The scenes of the day appeared before him. He saw that he only had a pair of weak hands, although his heart was strong.

    "Is that all there is to it?" he asked himself.

    At this time, he suddenly recalled when he was in the hospital, the cultural instructor told such a story:

    There was a Soviet air force hero named Alexei Maresiev. During the Great Patriotic War, after severely attacking enemy aircraft formations, his own plane unfortunately caught fire. He parachuted down, dragging his broken feet through the snow in the forest for eighteen days and nights. He had the tenacious character of a Soviet person. He had prosthetic legs installed in the hospital, and not only learned to walk, but also, because of his boundless enthusiasm for his country, he entered flight school again and regained his flying skills. Later, in air combat with the enemy, he repeatedly and successfully completed combat missions. People respected him and loved him very much, and called him "a real man."

    "Am I more difficult than Alexei?" Li Yuchang asked himself secretly.

    He also recalled fighting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in Meihekou, braving dense bullets, rushing forward with explosives to blow open a gap...

    "Is there such danger and difficulty now?" He severely blamed himself: "My hands are crippled, is my thinking also crippled? Li Yuchang, it seems that all you have is a weak heart!"

    "No, resolutely continue!" He suddenly sat up from the bed, startling his young wife.

    "What are you going to do!" She pressed him back into the quilt.

    The next day, the third day..., Li Yuchang became stronger in labor. Although he suffered a lot, he finally satisfied himself.

    Now, he can not only flexibly master the plow, but also skillfully hold a hoe to hoe the ground. When you see the hoe moving up and down from behind, you won't believe that the one controlling it is only a pair of disabled hands with only half a thumb on the left hand. In 1954, Li Yuchang cultivated his own five mu of land and also opened one and a half mu of wasteland. His model deeds encouraged every demobilized soldier returning home to build, and also encouraged all the people in the countryside. Farmer Gong Fachang said: "Li Yuchang's hands are crippled, but he is still actively engaged in labor and production. If we don't do a good job of farming, then we will be too sorry for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."

    The people love Li Yuchang, saying that he is a good soldier educated by the Communist Party, and elected him as a people's representative of the county. He was also named a first-class model disabled soldier in the county. But Li Yuchang did not have the slightest complacency or pride because of this. He said: "Without the education and cultivation of the Party, where would I have today's honor! I will definitely lead the mule awarded by the government back to cultivate the land well, actively mobilize the group members to establish cooperatives, step up production, support the liberation of Taiwan, and support national industrialization!"

    永不后退的战士
    谭天
    一九五二年五月，复员军人李玉昌回到了家乡——云南省文山县边犁街硝厂乡。
    高高的山，清清的流水，一望无际的碧绿的麦垅，像一条条绿色的绒毡。人们在自己分得的土地上愉快地劳动着，田野里又扬起一片互助组的小伙子和姑娘们欢愉的歌声。过去受尽痛苦的屈辱的家乡变得多么美好了啊！
    李玉昌久久地凝视着，胸中翻腾着一股奔涌的感情：“让我用自己的双手把家乡建设得更美好吧。”但是，当他低下头去时，他感到有些气馁了。他看到的是自己的一双没有指头的手！一九四七年，在东北解放战争最艰苦的时期，零下四十度的冰天雪地中，他随着部队同蒋贼军作着殊死的斗争，手指头和脚指头全部冻掉了。
    组织上是十分关怀和照顾他的。
    乡长（党支部书记）郭永贵来看他，关心地对他说：
    “李玉昌同志，你尽量少做些重活，不要把伤口弄翻了。生产上有困难，政府和群众会帮助你的。”
    “那怎么行啊，”李玉昌一面感到党和政府像慈母一般的温暖，一面又想到自己对革命必须继续作出贡献，他不能“坐地等花开”，光依靠政府的救济！
    互助组的人上山做活了，歌声隔着一重重山坡传过来，歌唱新中国今天的幸福，歌唱社会主义的灿烂远景！
    “难道我空着手走进社会主义社会去吗？坐在别人的肩上让人家作为负担带到社会主义社会去吗？”李玉昌在家门口眺望着，为今后的工作在深思着。
    “不，不能这样下去！共产党员是永远不掉队的！”他记起政委有一次的谈话，暗暗下了决心。
    第二天，他赶着耕牛，扛着犁杖，出现在群众原来给他代耕的土地上。
    “啊哟，你怎么来了！你的手足这样不灵便，还能干活？”群众议论纷纷地说。
    “只要有一分力量就要尽一分力量，我不能坐着白吃呀！”李玉昌沉静地回答着。
    他坚持地请别人帮他把右手绑在犁把上，又把牵牛绳绕在左手上，就像小孩子初学走路似的，跌跌绊绊地开始犁地。李玉昌原是庄稼人出身，使惯犁杖的。解放以前，在他给财主人家扛活的时候，他吆唤过多少条牛啊！最烈性的牛在他手下也变得服服贴贴的。但是现在牛不听他的使唤了，犁杖在地里歪歪斜斜地爬着，犁铧也吃不进土。李玉昌别红着脸，汗珠在他额上滚下来。群众都劝他：“算了吧，别费劲了，我们不会亏待你的！”
    “乡亲们，你们说的是什么话啊？难道我是怕你们亏待了我？我是尽我自己的本份！”李玉昌一面说着，一面又扶起了犁杖。
    李玉昌像在战斗中夺取敌人一个个碉堡似的，把每一垅田地当作他斗争的目标。手使不上劲，他就把全身倚在犁杖上，用自己的胁力来掌握它。犁沟渐渐地平直了，但他身上的夹衫也湿透了。
    牛似乎也慢慢听话了，温顺地拉着犁铧翻开褐色的新鲜的泥土。但是，它毕竟感觉到使唤它的不是一双强壮的手，那操纵它的力量愈来愈软弱。于是，这个调皮的牲口不听话了，一下子，把牵绳和犁把从李玉昌的手上拉脱。伤口挤破了，李玉昌痛得发昏。
    回家后，他的新婚的妻子焦急地说。
    “叫你不要去，你偏要去，你看你……”妻子忍不住责备他。
    夜深了，他两眼却再也闭不拢。白天的情景，一幕幕在他面前出现。他看到自己只有一双软弱的手，虽然他的心是强壮的。
    “难道就这样算了吗？”他问着自己。
    这时，他忽然回忆起住医院的时候，文化教员讲过这样一个故事：
    苏联有个叫阿历克赛·密烈西叶夫的空军英雄。他在卫国战争中，在痛击敌人机群后，不幸自己的飞机也着了火。他跳伞下来，拖着跌坏了的双脚在森林里的雪地上，爬行了十八个昼夜。他有着苏维埃人坚毅的性格。他在医院里安了双假腿，不仅学会了走路，而且，由于他对祖国的无限热情，他又进了飞行学校，重新掌握了飞行技术。后来在同敌人空战中，又屡次出色地完成了战斗任务。人们都非常尊敬他，爱戴他，称他为“真正的人”。
    “难道我比阿历克赛更困难吗？”李玉昌暗暗问着自己。
    他又回忆起了在梅河口同蒋贼军打仗的时候，冒着密集的子弹，抱着炸药猛冲上去炸开缺口……
    “难道现在有那样的危险和艰难吗？”他狠狠责备自己：“我的手残废了，我的思想也残废了吗？李玉昌啊，看来你有的还只是一颗软弱的心啊！”
    “不，坚决干下去！”他一骨碌从床上翻身坐起，把他年轻的妻子也惊醒了。
    “你到底要干啥啊！”她把他按回被窝里。
    第二天，第三天……，李玉昌在劳动中锻炼得更加坚强了，虽然他吃了不少苦，但是终于使自己满意了。
    现在，他不仅能够灵活地掌握犁耙，而且能够巧妙地拿着锄头锄地。当你从背后看到那上下飞动着的锄头，你不会相信掌握着它的只是左手才有半截拇指的残废的双手。一九五四年，李玉昌耕完了自己的五亩地，还开了一亩半生荒。他的模范事迹，鼓舞着每一个复员还乡建设的军人，也鼓舞着农村里所有的人们。农民龚发昌说：“李玉昌双手残废了，还积极劳动生产，我们要再不把庄稼作好，那就太对不起共产党和毛主席了。”
    人民热爱李玉昌，说他是共产党教育出来的好战士，选他为县的人民代表。他又被评为县的一等模范残废军人。但李玉昌并不因此而有丝毫的自满和骄傲。他说：“如果没有党的教育和培养，我哪有今天的荣誉！我一定把政府奖给的骡子牵回去把庄稼种好，积极动员组员们办社，加紧生产，支援解放台湾，支援国家工业化！”
