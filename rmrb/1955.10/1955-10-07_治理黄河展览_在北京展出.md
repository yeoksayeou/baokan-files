    "Harnessing the Yellow River Exhibition" opened on the 6th at the Forbidden City in Beijing. This exhibition was previously displayed in Zhengzhou and at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress. After the Beijing exhibition concludes, it will be successively exhibited in major cities throughout the Yellow River basin.
    The first exhibition hall displays pictures and electric models, briefly introducing the natural overview of the Yellow River basin, the causes of historical river course changes, and the serious disasters they brought. The exhibited pictures and ancient books emphatically illustrate the methods and great achievements of the working people of our country in fighting against the Yellow River disasters throughout history. It also introduces the enormous achievements in harnessing the Yellow River over the past nine years under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. From 1946 to 1954, the People's Government's total investment in harnessing the Yellow River reached 154 million yuan, equivalent to thirty-three times the total funding for harnessing the Yellow River during the eighteen years of reactionary rule from 1914 to 1932. Through dike construction, risk mitigation, cone penetration tests, tree planting, grass planting, and the construction of flood diversion weirs, overflow weirs, and the Yellow River irrigation project to benefit the Wei River, eight major floods were overcome.
    In the second exhibition hall, the various preparatory works done in recent years for the fundamental harnessing project of the Yellow River are centrally introduced. The exhibited pictures and models introduce the content of the comprehensive plan for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River's water hazards and developing the Yellow River's water resources, which was discussed and adopted at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress. The overview of the first phase of the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River and the happy prospects of the Yellow River serving the people are displayed on electric models and huge oil paintings.
