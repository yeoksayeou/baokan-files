    "Meeting in Spring" and Others
    Chen Jinqing, Standing Director of the Chinese Dance Art Research Association
    In 1951, during the Third World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship in Berlin, some of our comrades from the Chinese Youth Art Troupe saw the dance drama "The Red Poppy" starring Lyuba Kolchakova and Asen Gavrilov. This was a dance drama with the theme of China's revolutionary struggle. Lyuba Kolchakova created the beautiful image of Peach Blossom, a kind-hearted Chinese woman with a sense of justice and patriotic ideas. We were deeply attracted by the performances of Lyuba Kolchakova and Asen Gavrilov, as well as the plot development of the entire dance drama. From this performance, we saw the Bulgarian people's concern for the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. That day, after watching the dance drama, we went backstage with excitement to pay our respects to Lyuba Kolchakova and other actors.

    Four years have passed. Today, Lyuba Kolchakova and Asen Gavrilov, along with other Bulgarian artists, have come to China for a performance tour, giving us the opportunity to appreciate their excellent performing arts, which is truly a blessing for Chinese audiences.

    At the opening ceremony's performance gala, Lyuba Kolchakova performed three wonderful ballets for us.

    "Meeting in Spring" is a very creative program that reflects real life using ballet techniques and forms: a young rural couple meets on a bright spring day. The girl gives the young man a rose, and the young man kisses the girl with unrestrained joy. The pas de deux by Lyuba Kolchakova and Asen Gavrilov creates many beautiful scenes. I particularly like the moment when the two of them face each other across a long-handled farm tool and whisper intimately; that scene is like a moving oil painting. In this program, Lyuba Kolchakova created the image of a gentle, quiet, and pure girl, and Asen Gavrilov created the image of a handsome rural youth full of masculine beauty. Due to the excellent performance, they re-performed it at the enthusiastic request of the audience; the beauty lies in the subtle changes in the second performance, which were even more thought-provoking.

    "The Dying Swan" is a work by the French composer Saint-Saëns. This is a traditional solo ballet with very delicate expressions and techniques. A pure white swan is injured and can no longer fly steadily. Due to the pain, she shakes her wings, and gradually, her wings lose strength, and she spirals down from the air. She struggles to take off again but falls. She endures the pain, her breathing is short and tense, and even the feathers on her wings tremble. She finally dies quietly. Lyuba Kolchakova accurately interpreted the theme of the music and created the image of a beautiful swan. Her moving and delicate expressions cannot but evoke people's regret for the swan's death.

    "Youth Waltz" is a pas de deux full of vitality and youthful spirit, with very unrestrained emotions. Strong rhythms, fast jumps, such as the woman jumping from the ground and sitting on the man's shoulders, are all difficult techniques to master in ballet. The young people played by Lyuba Kolchakova and Asen Gavrilov in this pas de deux are a new type of young men and women, who understand work and also understand life, dedicating their youth to socialist construction and never knowing fatigue. This is a very inspiring pas de deux.

    It is commendable that Lyuba Kolchakova created three completely different images in one evening.

    Lyuba Kolchakova has won the Dimitrov Prize for her achievements in dance art. In the Fourth World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship, she and Asen Gavrilov were both winners in the ballet competition.

    Bulgarian ballet art has been reformed and developed after liberation with the strong help of the Soviet Union. Lyuba Kolchakova and Asen Gavrilov both studied at the Moscow Dance School for many years; the Soviet Union also sent the dance drama directing expert Horfin (the director of the children's dance drama "Doctor Aybolit," which the Soviet National Moscow Musical Theatre brought to China last year) to Bulgaria to assist in the work for three years. This situation is similar to the current situation of dance art in our China. We have also hired Soviet experts, and in addition to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and developing traditional national dance art, we must also establish ballet dance art. In ballet, undoubtedly, Bulgaria is a step ahead of us. We should learn well from the Bulgarian dancers. Let us work together in the big family of the socialist camp, under the guidance of the advanced artistic experience of Soviet socialist realism!

    I wish the Bulgarian dancers continuous and even more brilliant achievements!

    “春天里的会见”及其他
    中国舞蹈艺术研究会常务理事　陈锦清
    一九五一年在柏林举行第三届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节时，我们中国青年艺术团的部分同志看到了柳芭·柯尔查柯娃和阿森·加夫里洛夫主演的舞剧“红罂粟花”。这是一出以中国的革命斗争为题材的舞剧，柳芭·柯尔查柯娃创造了一个心地善良、富有正义感和爱国主义思想的中国妇女——桃花的美丽形象。我们被柳芭·柯尔查柯娃和阿森·加夫里洛夫的表演，以及整个舞剧的情节发展深深地吸引住了。从这个演出中，我们看到了保加利亚人民对中国人民的革命斗争的关怀。那天，我们看完舞剧以后，曾怀着兴奋的心情到后台去向柳芭·柯尔查柯娃和其他演员们致敬。
    事隔四年。今天，柳芭·柯尔查柯娃和阿森·加夫里洛夫同其他保加利亚艺术家们一起到中国来作访问演出，使我们有机会欣赏他们的优秀的表演艺术，真是中国观众的幸事。
    在开幕式那晚的演出晚会上，柳芭·柯尔查柯娃为我们表演了三个精采的芭蕾舞。
    “春天里的会见”是一个很有创造性的节目，它是以芭蕾舞的技巧和形式来反映现实生活的：一对农村的青年男女，在春光明媚的日子里相会了，姑娘送给青年一朵玫瑰，青年以不能抑制的喜悦轻吻了姑娘。柳芭·柯尔查柯娃和阿森·加夫里洛夫的双人舞构成许多美丽的画面。我特别喜欢他们二人隔着长柄农具相对而密密私语的那一刹那间，那个场面真像一幅动人的油画。在这个节目里，柳芭·柯尔查柯娃创造了一个温柔、恬静而纯洁的少女的形象，阿森·加夫里洛夫创造了一个英俊的富于男性美的农村青年的形象。由于表演的精采，在观众热烈邀请下，他们又重演了一次；妙在重演第二次中有个别小的变化更耐人寻味。
    “天鹅之死”是法国作曲家圣桑的作品。这是一个传统的、表情和技巧都很细致的单人芭蕾舞。一只洁白的天鹅负伤了，她再也不能稳健地飞翔了，由于疼痛，她抖擞着双翅，逐渐地，双翅失去力量，从空中回旋落地，她挣扎着再起飞，又倒下，她忍着创痛，呼吸短促而紧张，翅膀甚至于羽毛都颤栗着。她终于安静地死去了。柳芭·柯尔查柯娃确切地解释了音乐的主题，创造了一只美丽的天鹅形象。她的动人而细腻的表情，不能不引起人们对天鹅的死的惋惜。
    “青年圆舞曲”是一个充满着生命力，洋溢着青春气息的双人舞，感情非常奔放。强烈的节奏，快速度的跳跃，如女的在地上一跃而坐在男的肩上的动作等，都是芭蕾舞中很难掌握的技巧。柳芭·柯尔查柯娃和阿森·加夫里洛夫在这个双人舞中所扮演的青年，是一对新型的青年男女，是懂得工作也懂得生活，把自己的青春献给社会主义建设而永远不知疲倦的先进青年。这是一个非常振奋人心的双人舞。
    柳芭·柯尔查柯娃在一个晚会中创造了三个完全不同的形象，这是难能可贵的。
    柳芭·柯尔查柯娃由于她在舞蹈艺术上的成就，曾获得季米特洛夫奖金，在第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节中，她和阿森·加夫里洛夫都是芭蕾舞比赛获奖者。
    保加利亚的芭蕾舞艺术在解放后由于苏联的大力帮助而得到改革和发展，柳芭·柯尔查柯娃和阿森·加夫里洛夫都曾在莫斯科舞蹈学校学习多年；苏联还曾派舞剧编导专家霍尔芬（去年苏联国立莫斯科音乐剧院来我国访问演出的儿童舞剧“阿依波利特医生”的编导）赴保加利亚协助工作了三年。这种情况和我们中国今天的舞蹈艺术情况类似，我们也聘请了苏联专家，在学习苏联的先进经验、发展民族传统的舞蹈艺术之外，同时也要建立芭蕾舞蹈艺术。在芭蕾舞方面，无疑的，保加利亚比我们先进了一步。我们应该很好地向保加利亚舞蹈家们学习。让我们在社会主义阵营的大家庭里，在苏联社会主义现实主义的先进艺术经验的指导下，共同携手努力前进吧！
    祝保加利亚的舞蹈家们不断地获得更辉煌的成就！
