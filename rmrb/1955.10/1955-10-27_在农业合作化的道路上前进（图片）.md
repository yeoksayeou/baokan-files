    More than 15,000 agricultural production cooperatives newly established in Sichuan Province before and after the autumn harvest have already begun preparations for autumn plowing and sowing. After the Fifth Loving Eighth Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qingping Township, Pi County, was established, it immediately purchased new-style farm tools.
