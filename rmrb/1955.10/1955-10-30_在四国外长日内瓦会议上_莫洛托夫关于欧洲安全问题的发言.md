    At the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference
    Molotov's Speech on European Security Issues

Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen,

We have begun discussing European security and the German question. Although we have included these two issues in the first item on the agenda, we should not forget that in the instructions of the heads of government, the issue of European security is listed first. This is in line with the essence of the issue, because the issue of European security is of decisive significance to all countries in Europe.

The four countries have always proceeded from this premise when discussing the future of Germany. This consideration has served as the basis for a number of agreements signed by the four countries during World War II and after the war on the German issue. These agreements particularly emphasized the need to prevent the resurgence of German militarism, which could once again threaten the maintenance of European peace. The Soviet delegation believes that any attempt to diminish the significance of such a major issue as European security is unfounded if we are committed to seeking mutually agreeable ways to create conditions for lasting and peaceful cooperation among European countries.

Ensuring European security and preventing Europe from being engulfed in war again are among the most important international issues of our time. Historical experience has proven the great significance of the European situation for the fate of world peace. As everyone knows, wars that broke out in Europe in the past spread to other countries and continents, causing countless sacrifices of human lives and enormous destruction of material resources.

The lessons of history also show that on the eve of the outbreak of the two world wars, military blocs of countries were established in Europe. For example, on the eve of World War I, some military blocs prepared for conflict for several years, expanding their armies and increasing their military budgets. The same was true on the eve of World War II, which was provoked by Hitler's Germany.

All this not only shows how important ensuring European security is for world peace, but also shows that the way to create conditions for a peaceful life for the people of Europe should not be sought on the basis of establishing military blocs, but on the basis of the joint efforts of European countries for the sake of peace. It is in this undeniable spirit that the Soviet government advocates the establishment in Europe of a collective security system in which all European countries (regardless of their social and national systems) and the United States can participate.

The Soviet government has stated its position on European security issues more than once. This issue was fully clarified at the Four Power Summit Conference. However, the heads of the governments of the United States, Britain, and France did not express their attitude towards the Soviet government's proposal to conclude an all-European treaty on European collective security at the last meeting, so we hope to do so at this meeting. We would also like to add some comments.

It is often said that the proposal to establish European collective security seems to cause damage to the security of Western countries, because this proposal stipulates the final abolition of existing blocs and corresponding agreements, according to which some countries have undertaken mutual obligations, including military ones.

We believe that this concern is unfounded. However, taking into account the position taken by some countries on this issue, in order to promote the possibility of reaching an agreement, the Soviet government has proposed a proposal to implement the establishment of European collective security in two stages.

In the first stage, the obligations undertaken by countries under existing treaties and agreements will not be affected by the conclusion of the European Collective Security Treaty. This refers to the obligations undertaken by members of the North Atlantic Group and the Western European Union, as well as the obligations undertaken by members of the Warsaw Treaty. Of course, when transitioning to the second stage, the obligations undertaken under the European Security Treaty will become fully effective, and the existing treaties and agreements will cease to be effective, and the military blocs established under them will be abolished.

We believe that this proposal, which takes into account the current situation in Europe, will help to bring the views of the countries concerned closer together when discussing European security issues.

We have already said that this proposal to establish all-European security has another advantage, that is, it can test in action at the first stage a system based on the joint efforts of all European countries for the maintenance of peace (even if this effort is initially limited in scale). It seems that as long as we truly wish to establish solid guarantees for the peaceful development of the people of Europe, all this should prompt us to reach due agreement.

The idea of European collective security is gaining increasing support. This is not accidental. As everyone knows, some countries that have neither joined the Western military bloc nor participated in the Warsaw Treaty have expressed a positive attitude towards European collective security. According to the remarks of leaders of some countries, there are other countries that will also take a good attitude towards the proposal for European collective security if an agreement is reached between the major powers on this issue.

It is also not accidental that more and more countries are condemning the policy of piecing together military blocs, because they realize that this policy leads to the deepening of new war threats. At the same time, it can be pointed out that not only European countries, but also many countries in Asia, the Middle East, and the Near East correctly believe that attempts to drag them into military blocs are a threat to their security and national independence.

In many countries, the desire to implement a policy of neutrality is strengthening, which is one of the manifestations of a negative attitude towards the policy of piecing together military blocs. The Soviet government has already said that this desire deserves to be supported as much as possible, because it is in line with the interests of easing international tensions and consolidating peace.

Facts have proved that the existence of mutually hostile military blocs inevitably leads to an arms race. And the consequences of the arms race are well known to those people who bear the increasingly heavy burden of military expenditure.

The scale of the military budgets of some countries represented here powerfully illustrates this point. Direct military spending in the United States' 1948-1949 budget year accounted for 33 percent of federal budget expenditures, while in the 1953-1954 budget year, this expenditure had reached 69 percent. In Britain, during this period, the proportion of direct military spending in the total budget expenditure increased from 24 percent to 38 percent. France's direct military spending in 1949 accounted for 24 percent of total budget expenditures, and by 1954 it had almost increased to 33 percent.

The situation that has formed in Europe after the conclusion of the Paris Agreement has forced the Soviet Union to pay closer attention to strengthening its own armed forces. Therefore, the proportion of military expenditure in the Soviet Union in 1955 accounts for about 20 percent of the total budget expenditure.

The danger of the arms race should be paid attention to especially considering the following situation: despite the increasing demands of the people of all countries to ban atomic weapons and eliminate the threat of atomic war, the scale of manufacturing and accumulating atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons is getting larger and larger.

On the other hand, it is becoming increasingly clear that only if the countries concerned, especially the major powers, take joint action to maintain European peace, can the arms race be ended, international tensions be eased, and trust be established in international relations. Without this trust, the people of all countries cannot rest assured about their tomorrow. If proof is needed that this truth is irrefutable, then the Geneva Conference of the Four Power Summit is proof. This conference has had a very significant positive impact on the entire international situation and has deepened the confidence of the people of all countries in the possibility of reaching an agreement on outstanding issues.

If the four countries can reach an agreement on joint measures to ensure European security, it will fundamentally change the situation in Europe. This conclusion should be drawn if the significance of the obligations undertaken by countries under the European Collective Security Treaty is taken into account.

Among these obligations, the first is to renounce the use of force and to resolve all disputes that may arise between the contracting parties by peaceful means. The obligation to take joint measures to eliminate the threat of armed attack in Europe, as well as the obligation to provide mutual assistance, including military assistance, to any contracting party that is subjected to armed attack, is of equal importance. The same is true of the obligation of the contracting parties to consult together on measures to maintain European peace.

As everyone knows, all these important obligations are stipulated in the draft all-European treaty on European collective security proposed by the Soviet government. We are deeply convinced that this collective security treaty, which can be joined by all European countries willing to participate, can serve as a reliable basis for peaceful cooperation among European countries.

The conclusion of this treaty will greatly help to solve other international problems, including the German question. This issue can only be resolved by establishing an effective European security system and gradually bringing the two Germanys that now exist—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—closer together. The European collective security system, in which the two Germanys can participate together with other European countries before German reunification, will help to create the preconditions for Germany to develop into a peaceful country, and will also give the people of all European countries the confidence that Germany's destiny is no longer controlled by the forces that have pushed it more than once onto the destructive path of aggression and war adventures.

As for the German question, the Soviet delegation will explain its more detailed views and put forward corresponding proposals at the appropriate stage of our meeting. Needless to say, at that time we will also consider the question of the participation of representatives of the two Germanys—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany—in our discussions on the German question.

Regarding the discussion of European security issues, the Soviet delegation would like to draw everyone's attention to the following points.

As everyone knows, the discussion on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons has not yet reached a degree of agreement sufficient to make the entire issue have a realistic basis. The current situation is that the expansion of armaments is still continuing, and not only continuing, but also intensifying. Needless to say, every achievement in establishing the real security of European countries will help to establish the necessary trust in international relations, and achievements in resolving the disarmament issue depend on this trust. It is often said that the establishment of a European collective security system and the conclusion of corresponding treaties for this purpose are not a sufficiently effective tool to guarantee the security of European countries. Then may I ask, where is another path that can guarantee the conditions for the peaceful development of the people of Europe? Is it thought that establishing military blocs of countries, inciting hostility, distrust and mutual suspicion among countries, continuing the "Cold War" and unlimited expansion of armaments is this path?

In fact, every day there are more and more facts proving that the road of establishing military blocs is a dangerous road. In contrast, cooperation between countries, especially cooperation between major powers, not only in the anti-aggression cooperation during World War II, but also in the cause of maintaining peace, is a path that meets the requirements of safeguarding international security. Only this path is in line with the "Geneva spirit" that people began to reasonably talk about after the Four Power Summit Conference—the spirit of mutual understanding and the effort to seek mutually agreed ways to resolve outstanding international issues and consolidate peace.

These are the additional comments that we believe are necessary to make on the Soviet government's proposal to establish a European collective security system.

Today, British representative Mr. Macmillan, on behalf of the three countries, put forward a proposal called "Restoring German Unity and Security." We have also listened carefully to Mr. Macmillan's explanation.

The Soviet delegation welcomes the fact that the British, American, and French governments recognize that not only the German question but also the European security issue must be raised. Some of the clauses in this document submitted to us for discussion require further discussion, and we will study them carefully. However, there are already some opinions on this document now. First of all, it must be pointed out that the wording of the proposal itself does not conform to the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries, because the European security issue is listed first in the instructions. In fact, the impression is created that the three-country proposal does not meet the requirements for establishing effective European security, and even on the contrary, the implementation of this proposal will lead to a greater intensification of the European situation and an exacerbation of international tensions.

The reason for drawing this conclusion is first of all because this proposal will actually not only maintain, but also strengthen the existing military blocs in Europe. This proposal directly stipulates that there is only one opportunity for a unified Germany, that is, when the entire Germany embarks on the road of re-militarization, and it also stipulates in advance that such a Germany should be an inevitable member of the North Atlantic Treaty. The accompanying explanation of the defensive nature of the North Atlantic Group in the proposal is not verified in any way and cannot be verified. If that is indeed the case, then there is no reason to refuse the Soviet Union's participation in the aforementioned convention, but the Soviet Union was refused participation.

As for the plan put forward with the purpose of re-militarizing Germany (even if it is implemented in stages), we have already answered this point: whether it is implemented immediately or in stages, we cannot agree to the re-militarization of Germany, because the re-militarization of Germany is incompatible with ensuring all-European security.

One cannot but pay attention to the fact that, on the one hand, the three-country proposal puts forward the so-called "Eden Plan" for free elections throughout Germany. On the other hand, in fact, it is decided in advance that no matter what opinions the German people express in this election, it should be decided immediately that the unified Germany should embark on the road of re-militarization, and should also become an inevitable member of the Western European military bloc.

The conditions put forward by the three countries can be understood in this way: their draft treaty can only take effect "when the unified Germany decides to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union." In this plan, there is absolutely no sign of considering the true free will of the German people, and the will of the German people will be expressed in the all-German elections.

As for the arms limitation and supervision mentioned in the three-country proposal, as everyone knows, such limitations stipulated in the existing agreements of Western countries do not prevent the current unlimited expansion of armaments, especially the manufacture of the most dangerous and destructive weapons. Obviously, under such circumstances, there is no way to seriously talk about any guarantees for the security of the Soviet Union or other European countries, and they have every reason to regard the revival of German militarism and the existence of mutually hostile military blocs in Europe as a threat to their own security.

Finally, according to this proposal, what guarantee can be talked about if one is limited to purely consultations in the event that European peace is disrupted or there is a threat of disruption?

All this shows that if the three-country proposal is adopted, it is equivalent to the Soviet Union and some European countries themselves helping to revive German militarism, handing over the entire unified Germany to the hands of German militarists, and strengthening the military bloc whose spearhead is directed against these countries. However, it is unlikely that anyone would seriously have such expectations.

The above also determines the Soviet Union's attitude towards the following proposal: this proposal is to combine the treaty we proposed with the implementation of the so-called "Eden Plan" for organizing all-German elections. This plan does not meet the purpose of implementing truly free all-German elections. Mr. Macmillan's explanation after the three countries put forward their proposal did not dispel our doubts: what consequences will the implementation of this proposal produce?

Of course, the Soviet delegation does not refuse to study any proposals aimed at establishing true European security, and it is making every effort to promote an agreement on this important issue. We hope that our future discussions will be in line with this purpose.

Finally, the Soviet delegation asks the conference to pay attention to the draft "All-European Treaty on European Collective Security" that I put forward.

### 在四国外长日内瓦会议上  莫洛托夫关于欧洲安全问题的发言

专栏：

    在四国外长日内瓦会议上
    莫洛托夫关于欧洲安全问题的发言主席先生，各位先生们，
    我们已经开始讨论欧洲安全和德国问题。虽然我们把这两个问题并入第一项议程中，不过我们不应该忘记，在政府首脑的指示中，欧洲安全的问题是列在首位的。这是符合问题的实质的，因为欧洲安全的问题对欧洲一切国家具有决定性的意义。
    四国在讨论德国前途问题时，一向就是从这一前提出发的。这种考虑已经作为四国在第二次世界大战期间和战后就德国问题签订的一些协定的基础。在那时签订的各项协定中特别着重指出，必须防止可能重新威胁欧洲和平的维护的德国军国主义复活。苏联代表团认为，如果致力于寻求大家意见一致的途径来为欧洲各国的持久的、和平的合作创立条件，那末任何打算缩小像欧洲安全问题这样一个主要问题的意义的企图都是找不到根据的。
    保障欧洲安全和不许欧洲再次弥漫战火，是现代最重要的国际问题之一。历史经验证明，欧洲局势对世界和平的命运有多么重大的意义。大家知道，过去在欧洲爆发的战争蔓延到其他国家和大陆，引起了无数的人力牺牲和巨大的物力破坏。
    历史的教训还说明了，在两次世界大战爆发的前夕，在欧洲都曾建立过国家军事集团。譬如，在第一次世界大战前夕，当时一些军事集团在好几年中为冲突作准备，扩充自己的军队，增加自己的军事预算。在由希特勒德国所挑起的第二次世界大战的前夕也是这样。
    这一切不仅说明了，保障欧洲安全对世界和平有多么大的意义；而且还说明了，不应该在建立军事集团的基础上去寻求为欧洲人民创造和平的生活条件的办法，而应该在欧洲各国为和平的利益共同努力的基础上去寻求这种办法。正是本着这一不容置辩的道理，苏联政府主张在欧洲建立一个欧洲各国（不问它们的社会制度和国家制度如何）以及美国都可以参加的集体安全体系。
    苏联政府已不止一次地申述过自己在欧洲安全问题上的立场。这一问题在四国政府首脑会议上也得到充分的阐明。但是，美国、英国、法国三国政府的首脑在上次会议上并没有对苏联政府所提出的缔结关于欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议表明自己的态度，因此我们希望在这次会议上做到这一点。我们还想补充一些意见。
    往往有人说，关于建立欧洲集体安全的建议似乎会给西方国家的安全带来损失，因为这个建议规定最终取消现有的集团和相应的协定，而某些国家根据这些协定承担了相互的义务，其中包括军事性质的义务。
    我们认为，这种忧虑是没有任何理由的。不过，考虑到某些国家在这个问题上所采取的立场，为了促进达成协议的可能性，苏联政府提出了一个建议，主张欧洲集体安全的建立分两个阶段逐步实行。
    在第一个阶段，各国根据现有的条约和协定所承担的义务不因缔结欧洲集体安全条约而受影响。这里指的是北大西洋集团和西欧联盟的成员国所承担的义务以及华沙条约成员国所承担的义务。当然，在转入第二个阶段时，根据欧洲安全条约所承担的义务就将完全生效，而现有的条约和协定就将停止生效，根据它们而建立的军事集团就将取消。
    我们认为，这个考虑到欧洲目前形成的局势的建议将有助于在讨论欧洲安全问题时有关国家的观点的接近。
    我们已经说过，这个建立全欧安全的建议还有一个优点，就是它可以在第一阶段在行动中考验以所有欧洲国家为了维护和平所作的共同努力（纵然这种努力在规模上说来起初是有限的）为基础的体系。看来，只要真正本着建立欧洲各国人民和平发展的巩固保障的愿望，那末这一切应该促使我们之间达成应有的协议。
    欧洲集体安全的思想得到越来越广泛的支持。这并不是偶然的。大家知道，某些既没有加入西方军事集团也没有参加华沙条约的国家，已经对欧洲集体安全表示了积极的态度。根据某些国家领导人物的言论来看，还有一些国家也将对欧洲集体安全的建议采取良好的态度，如果大国之间就这一问题达成协议的话。
    越来越多的国家谴责拼凑军事集团的政策，这也不是偶然的，因为它们认识到这种政策导致新战争威胁的加深。同时可以指出，不但欧洲国家，而且亚洲以及中东和近东的许多国家都正确地认为，把它们拉入军事集团的企图是对它们的安全和民族独立的一种威胁。
    在许多国家，实行中立政策的愿望正在加强，这就是对拼凑军事集团政策抱否定态度的表现之一。苏联政府已经说过，这种愿望是值得尽力予以支持的，因为它符合于缓和国际紧张局势的利益，符合于巩固和平的利益。
    事实证明，互相敌对的军事集团的存在不可避免地要引起扩军。而扩军的后果如何，那些肩上担负着越来越重的军费重担的人民是知道得很清楚的。
    有代表在座的某些国家的军事预算的规模有力地说明这一点。美国一九四八—一九四九预算年度中的直接军费开支占联邦预算支出部分的百分之三十三，而在一九五三—一九五四预算年度中这项开支就已占到百分之六十九。英国在这段时期中，直接军费开支在整个预算支出部分中的比重从百分之二十四增加到百分之三十八。法国一九四九年的直接军费开支占整个预算支出部分的百分之二十四，而到一九五四年几乎增加到百分之三十三。
    巴黎协定缔结后在欧洲所形成的局势使苏联不得不加紧注意加强本国的武装力量。因此，苏联在一九五五年的军费开支的比重约占整个预算支出部分的百分之二十。
    考虑到下列情况，就尤其应该注意扩军的危险，这种情况就是，尽管各国人民在加紧要求禁止原子武器和消除原子战争的威胁，但是制造和积累原子武器、氢武器的规模还是越来越大。
    另一方面，越来越明显的是，只有有关国家，首先是大国对维护欧洲和平采取共同行动，才能结束扩军，缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际关系中的信任，如果没有这种信任，各国人民对他们的明天就不能放心。如果需要证明这个道理是不可反驳的，那末四国政府首脑日内瓦会议就是一个证明，这个会议对整个国际局势产生了十分重大的良好影响，加深了各国人民对就悬而未决的问题达成协议的可能性的信心。
    四国如果能就保障欧洲安全的共同措施的问题达成协议，将会根本改变欧洲的局势。如果考虑到各国根据欧洲集体安全条约而承担的义务的意义，那末就应该得出这个结论。
    这些义务中首先就是放弃使用武力，和用和平方法解决缔约国之间可能发生的一切争端。关于采取共同措施来消除在欧洲发生武装进攻的威胁的义务以及一旦某个缔约国受到武装进攻时，给予相互的援助、包括军事援助在内的义务有着同样重要的意义。缔约国共同磋商采取维持欧洲和平的措施的义务也是如此。
    大家知道，在苏联政府提出的欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案中，这一切重要的义务都有规定。我们深深地相信，凡是愿意参加的欧洲国家一律都可以参加的这个集体安全条约是能够作为欧洲各国和平合作的可靠基础的。
    缔结这一条约，就会大大有助于解决其他国际问题，这里也包括德国问题。只有建立有效的欧洲安全体系和使现在存在的两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国逐渐接近，才能求得这一问题的解决。在德国统一之前两个德国可以同其他欧洲国家一起参加的欧洲集体安全体系有助于为德国发展为和平国家创造前提，同时还会使欧洲各国人民产生这样的信心：德国的命运已不再为那些不止一次把它推上侵略和战争冒险的毁灭道路的势力所掌握了。
    至于德国问题，苏联代表团将在我们会议进行的适当阶段说明自己的更为详细的意见并且提出相应的建议。不用说，那时我们还将要考虑关于两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国——的代表们参加我们的会议对德国问题的讨论的问题。
    关于欧洲安全问题的讨论，苏联代表团愿请大家注意以下各点。
    大家知道，在裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的讨论中还没有达到足以使整个问题具有现实基础的那种程度的协议。目前的情况是：扩充军备还在继续进行，而且不仅继续进行，还在加紧进行。用不着多说，在建立欧洲国家的真正安全方面获得的每一个成就都将有助于建立国际关系的必要信任，而在解决裁军问题方面的成就正是取决于这种信任。常常有人说，建立欧洲集体安全体系和为了这种目的而缔结相应的条约，并不是保证欧洲各国安全的充分有效的工具。那末请问，能够保证欧洲各国人民获得和平发展的条件的另外一条道路又在哪里呢？难道认为建立国家军事集团、在各国之间煽动敌意、不信任和互相怀疑、继续“冷战”和无限制的扩充军备就是这条道路吗？
    实际上，每天有越来越多的事实证明，建立军事集团的道路是一条危险的道路。与此相反，各国间的合作，首先是大国间的合作，不但像在第二次世界大战期间的反侵略中的合作，而且也在维护和平事业中合作，是一条符合保障国际安全的要求的道路。只有这条道路才符合人们在四国政府首脑会议后开始合理地谈论的“日内瓦精神”——相互谅解以及为解决悬而未决的国际问题和巩固和平而努力寻求一致同意的途径的精神。
    这就是我们认为有必要就苏联政府提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议所作的补充意见。
    今天英国代表麦克米伦先生代表三国提出了名为“恢复德国统一和安全”的建议。我们还认真听取了麦克米伦先生所作的解释。
    苏联代表团欢迎这一事实：英国、美国和法国政府承认不但必须提出德国问题而且还必须提出欧洲安全的问题。提交给我们讨论的这个文件的某些条款需要作进一步的讨论，我们将认真地研究它们。不过现在对这一文件就已经有了一些意见。首先必须指出，建议的措词本身就不符合四国政府首脑的指示，因为在指示中欧洲安全问题是列在首位的。实际上造成了这种印象，就是三国建议不符合建立有效的欧洲安全的要求，甚至相反，这一建议的实现将导致欧洲局势的更加尖锐化和国际紧张局势的加剧。
    所以作出这种结论，首先是由于这一建议实际上不仅会维持，而且会加强欧洲现有的军事集团。这一建议中直接规定统一德国的机会只有一个，就是在整个德国走上重新军国主义化道路的时候，并且还预先规定，这样的德国还应该是北大西洋公约的必然的成员国。在建议中关于北大西洋集团的防御性质所作的附带说明是没有加以任何证实的，而且也不可能加以证实。如果的确是那样的话，那就没有任何理由拒绝苏联参加上述公约，然而苏联是被拒绝参加的。
    至于提出的目的在于使德国重新军国主义化（那怕是分阶段实行）的计划，我们已经对这一点作了答复：无论是马上实行也好，或者是分阶段实行也好，我们都不能同意德国重新军国主义化，因为，德国重新军国主义化是同保障全欧安全不相容的。
    还不能不注意这一事实。一方面在三国建议中提出关于全德自由选举的所谓“艾登计划”。另一方面，实际上事先就决定，不问德国人民在这一选举中表示什么意见，现在就应该立即决定，统一后的德国应该走上重新军国主义化的道路，此外，还应该成为西欧军事集团的必然成员国。
    对三国提出的条件可以作这样的理解：它们的条约草案只有“当统一了的德国决定加入北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟时”才能生效。在这种计划中，绝对看不出有考虑德国人民真正自由意志的愿望，而德国人民的意志将会在全德选举中表现出来。
    至于三国建议中提到的军备限制和监督，大家知道，在西方国家的现有的协定中所规定的这类限制并不妨碍目前的无限制的扩充军备、特别是制造最具有危险性和毁灭性的各种武器。显然，在这种情况下，说不上认真地谈论对苏联或对其他欧洲国家的安全的任何保障，它们有充分理由把德国军国主义的复活和欧洲存在着彼此敌对的军事集团看成是对自己的安全的威胁。
    最后，根据这个建议，在一旦欧洲和平遭到破坏或者是有破坏的威胁时只限于纯粹的磋商，这能谈到什么保障呢？
    这一切说明，如果通过三国的建议，就等于苏联和一些欧洲国家自己帮助复活德国军国主义，把统一了的整个德国交到德国军国主义者的手里和加强矛头针对这些国家的军事集团。然而未必有谁会认真地有这样的指望。
    以上所述也决定了苏联对下列建议的态度：这个建议要把我们提出的条约同实行关于组织全德选举的所谓“艾登计划”结合起来。这一计划是不符合实行真正自由的全德选举的目的的。麦克米伦先生在三国提出自己的建议后所作的解释并不能打消我们的疑虑：实行这一建议将产生怎样的后果。
    当然，苏联代表团并不拒绝研究任何旨在建立真正的欧洲安全的建议，而且它在尽一切努力，以便促进在这一个重要问题上达成协议。我们希望，我们今后的讨论能够符合这种目的。
    最后苏联代表团请会议注意我所提出的“关于欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案。
