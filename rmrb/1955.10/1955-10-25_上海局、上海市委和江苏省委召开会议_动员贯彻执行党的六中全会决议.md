Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th. The Shanghai Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC held a meeting of leading cadres on the 21st. At the meeting, Ke Qingshi, Secretary of the Shanghai Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, delivered a report conveying the resolutions and spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party.

In his report, Ke Qingshi elaborated in detail on the great significance of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Party for the socialist construction and socialist transformation cause currently underway in our country, as well as the work of Party building. He said that agricultural cooperativization is not only a revolutionary movement involving 500 million rural people, but also closely related to the interests of the people nationwide and all aspects of work throughout the country. Communist Party members in Shanghai, especially leading comrades of the Party, should, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the spirit of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party, examine and improve their work according to socialist principles. Comrade Ke Qingshi criticized and self-criticized the shortcomings in the work of various departments in Shanghai. He emphasized that the "bound feet women" in the agricultural cooperativization movement are not unique to the agricultural sector. In Shanghai's state-owned industrial departments, state-owned commercial departments, transportation departments, the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, mass work, cultural and educational departments, and Party work, without exception, there are "bound feet women" walking with a swaying gait. He demanded that Party members in Shanghai learn from the lessons in the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Party and Chairman Mao's instructions, comprehensively examine their work, strictly criticize complacency, expose the "bound feet women" in all departments and all corners, and resolutely correct this error.

In his report conveying the spirit, Comrade Ke Qingshi especially mentioned that in order to implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Party, leading departments at all levels must make comprehensive plans so that they have a clear understanding; they must strengthen the leadership of the Party and improve their leadership style. He called on all Party comrades to conscientiously study Marxist-Leninist theory and the Party's instructions and documents.

Ke Qingshi also announced that the Shanghai Municipal Committee has decided to hold the Third Congress of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai in late November. The main topic of the conference will be to discuss how to implement the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd. The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of leading cadres from various departments, commissions, and offices, bureaus, and departments of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee on the 22nd, mobilizing all departments to strive for the complete realization of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party.

At the meeting, Jiang Weiqing, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CPC, in accordance with the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party on the issue of agricultural cooperativization and the spirit of Chairman Mao's report on the issue of agricultural cooperativization, and in light of the actual situation in Jiangsu Province, repeatedly explained the great significance of agricultural cooperativization, criticized various erroneous views, and instructed all departments to conscientiously implement the resolution of the Plenary Session in their work. He said: "The high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement in Jiangsu Province has arrived. This autumn, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in the province has increased from more than 35,000 to more than 121,000. The number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has reached 40 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province. It is estimated that another 22,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives will continue to be established this winter and next spring. In the next five months, we must vigorously consolidate the new cooperatives and improve the old cooperatives, in order to lay a reliable foundation for gradually realizing agricultural cooperativization throughout the province."

Jiang Weiqing then said that the most central and urgent task in the countryside at present is to consolidate the new cooperatives and improve the old cooperatives. Before the end of March next year, all new and old cooperatives should be rectified in batches once or twice to initially consolidate the new cooperatives and improve the old cooperatives from their existing foundation. At present, we must seize the central link of autumn harvest and autumn planting, and be sure to do a good job of autumn harvest in a timely manner and complete the autumn planting plan.

    柯庆施同志在传达报告中，特别提到为了贯彻党的六中全会精神，各级领导部门一定要作出全面规划，使心中有数；一定要加强党的领导，改进领导作风。他号召全党同志，要认真学习马克思列宁主义理论，学习党的指示和文件。
    柯庆施并宣布：上海市委已决定在十一月下旬举行中国共产党上海市第三次代表会议。会议的主要议题是讨论如何贯彻执行党的七届六中全会（扩大）的决议。
    据新华社南京二十三日电　中共江苏省委员会在二十二日召开了各部、委和省人民委员会各办公室、厅、局的负责干部会议，动员各部门为完满地实现党的七届六中全会（扩大）的决议而斗争。
    会上，中共江苏省委员会书记江渭清根据党的七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议和毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告的精神，结合江苏省实际情况，反复说明了农业合作化的伟大意义，批判了各种错误观点，指示各部门要在自己的工作中认真贯彻执行全会的决议。他说：“江苏省农业合作化运动的高潮已经到来。今年秋季，全省的农业生产合作社已经由三万五千多个发展到十二万一千多个。入社农户已经达到全省农户总数的百分之四十。预计今冬明春还有两万两千多个农业生产合作社要继续建立。今后五个月内，要大力巩固新社，提高老社，为逐步实现全省的农业合作化打下可靠的基础。”
    江渭清接着说，当前农村中最中心最迫切的任务就是要巩固新社，提高老社。在明年三月底以前，把全部新社、老社，分批整顿一次到两次，把新社初步巩固下来，老社从现有基础上提高一步。当前必须抓紧秋收秋播这一中心环节，务必及时做好秋收，完成秋播计划。
