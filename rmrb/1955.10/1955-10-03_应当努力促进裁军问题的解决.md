At present, the most common wish of people all over the world is that governments of all countries, especially the governments of major powers, should continue to implement the "Geneva spirit" and actively strive to solve international problems and strengthen peace and the security of all peoples. In this regard, the Soviet Union has already done many things since the Geneva Conference. The letter from Chairman Bulganin of the Soviet Council of Ministers to US President Eisenhower on September 19, and the proposals made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the UN General Assembly on September 23 regarding further easing of international tensions and developing international cooperation, are new and significant efforts made by the Soviet Union in a firm adherence to this path.

Both Chairman Bulganin's letter and Foreign Minister Molotov's proposals emphasize the importance of promoting a solution to the problem of arms reduction. The disarmament issue is the most important issue relating to the vital interests of tens of millions of people around the world. Striving to promote the solution of this problem is of great positive significance for further easing international tensions and strengthening trust between countries. The results of the Geneva Four-Power Summit have already created the necessary preconditions for achieving some progress in this regard. In particular, the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries' decision to reduce the number of armed forces, and the recent Soviet Union's action to abandon its naval base in Finland - Porkkala Udd, provide examples for other countries to take corresponding actions.

In order to ease the situation in the Far East and the international situation, the Chinese people have also made a series of efforts. Recently, the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers announced that it will withdraw six divisions from Korea and return to the motherland. This action of the Chinese people has received widespread attention from world opinion, because it conforms to the wishes of the people of all countries, and it is of great help to promoting an atmosphere of international trust, thereby promoting the discussion and resolution of the disarmament issue.

However, people have seen that the UN Disarmament Commission Subcommittee, which is working to seek a solution to the disarmament problem that can be accepted by everyone, has not achieved the results that people expected since its resumption. The reason for this is that the US representative has completely put aside the issue of reducing armed forces and armaments and banning atomic weapons, and only expressed the hope to first and mainly discuss the US proposal regarding the mutual exchange of military information between the Soviet Union and the United States and mutual aerial photography over the territories of the two countries. In this way, the work of the subcommittee has encountered obstacles. This situation is not in line with the wishes of the people of all countries, and this situation should be changed.

Chairman Bulganin's letter and Foreign Minister Molotov's proposals point out the way to break the current deadlock on the disarmament issue. The relevant parties and the UN General Assembly should consider these opinions and suggestions put forward by the Soviet government, so that progress can be made on the disarmament issue.

The people of all countries demand disarmament in order to eliminate the threat of new wars and to reduce the excessive arms burden on them. Therefore, the primary task in this issue is to stop the expansion of armaments, reduce armed forces and armaments. The Soviet Union's disarmament proposal put forward on May 10 is a practical and feasible plan to achieve the above goals. The United States, Britain and France have also put forward their proposals on disarmament. All these proposals should be carefully studied. The US representative in the UN Disarmament Commission Subcommittee only hopes to first and mainly discuss the US proposal. This attitude does not show the spirit of seeking cooperative understanding. Moreover, the US proposal only involves the issue of the exchange of military intelligence between the Soviet Union and the United States and aerial photography over the territories of the two countries, and does not mention the necessity of reducing armaments and banning atomic weapons. Obviously, if the US proposal is implemented without taking direct disarmament measures, it will never stop the expansion of armaments, nor will it eliminate the threat of new wars. Moreover, it will make people relax their vigilance against the threat to peace caused by the expansion of armaments. The US "Newsday" also acknowledged in its September 8th commentary on the US proposal: "This plan is not aimed at disarmament, but to maintain and consolidate the current extreme level of armaments. This plan will not affect the continued development of the massive stockpiling of devastating hydrogen bombs."

Chairman Bulganin pointed out in his letter to Eisenhower: It is necessary for countries to exchange military intelligence with each other at a certain stage, but it is best for all countries, not just the Soviet Union and the United States, to provide such intelligence (including conventional armaments and nuclear armaments) to international supervisory and inspection agencies established through agreement. Moreover, the submission of the above-mentioned intelligence to international supervision and inspection agencies is only meaningful if measures for disarmament and banning atomic weapons are agreed upon. As for the issue of aerial photography over the territories of the two countries, Chairman Bulganin pointed out that this proposal completely omits the armed forces and military facilities outside the Soviet Union and the United States. If this measure is extended to all armed forces and military facilities in the territories of other countries, this will raise a new question: Will other countries allow foreign aircraft to conduct aerial photography over their sovereign territories? Therefore, in the current situation, this is not an issue that can promote effective progress in achieving disarmament.

In order to promote progress on the disarmament issue, a common agreement should be reached on those issues that everyone has already agreed on or are very close to. As everyone knows, after the Soviet Union put forward its proposal on May 10, the Soviet Union and Western countries have a common view on the level of armed forces of major powers and on the issue of banning the use of atomic weapons, and all countries have also recognized that taking measures to help prevent one country from suddenly attacking another country is of great significance for ensuring international peace and security. In this regard, the Soviet Union has also put forward the proposal to establish observation posts in major ports, railway hubs, main highways and airports where large troop formations and combat equipment may be concentrated. It can be seen that if all countries are truly sincere in achieving disarmament, then there should be no difficulty in reaching an agreement on the above issues. In this case, if anyone is unwilling to make serious efforts in this direction, then one cannot help but think that they are unwilling to promote the realization of disarmament. Chairman Bulganin's letter and Foreign Minister Molotov's proposals at the UN General Assembly put the Western countries, especially the United States, to a severe test.

The people of all countries demand that all countries show the "Geneva spirit" not only on the disarmament issue, but also on resolving other pressing international issues. In his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Molotov also put forward opinions on establishing a European collective security system, resolving the outstanding issues in the Far East and Asia, and the task of the United Nations Organization to further ease international tensions. If these issues can be resolved in a spirit of cooperation and understanding, it will greatly contribute to strengthening peace and international cooperation.

The United Nations has a major responsibility for further easing international tensions and strengthening international cooperation. It should speak with weight in resolving the disarmament issue and other outstanding international issues in order to realize the wishes of the people of all countries. The Chinese people warmly support the opinions on the disarmament issue put forward by Chairman Bulganin in his letter to Eisenhower, and fully support the suggestions made by Foreign Minister Molotov at the UN General Assembly on September 23. The UN's adoption of the Soviet proposal will be in line with the vital interests of the people of all countries.

### 应当努力促进裁军问题的解决

    应当努力促进裁军问题的解决
    目前，全世界人民最普遍的愿望，是各国政府，特别是有关大国的政府继续贯彻“日内瓦精神”，积极地为解决国际问题、加强和平和各国人民的安全而努力。在这方面，苏联在日内瓦会议以后已经做了许多事情。九月十九日，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给美国总统艾森豪威尔的信件，和九月二十三日苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在联合国大会上提出的关于进一步和缓国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的措施的建议，都是苏联坚定地沿着这条道路所作的新的重大努力。
    布尔加宁主席的信件和莫洛托夫外长提出的建议，都强调了促进裁减军备问题的解决的重要性。裁军问题是全世界千千万万人们的切身利益有关的最重要问题。努力促进这个问题的解决，对于进一步和缓国际紧张局势和加强国与国之间的信任有着重大的积极意义。日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果已经为争取在这方面取得某种进展创造了必要的先决条件。特别是苏联和人民民主国家决定裁减武装部队人数的措施，和最近苏联放弃它在芬兰的海军基地——波卡拉乌德的行动，更为其他国家采取相应的行动提供了范例。
    为了和缓远东和国际局势，中国人民也已经作了一系列的努力。最近，中国人民志愿军总部又宣布将从朝鲜撤离六个师返回祖国。中国人民的这个行动受到了世界舆论的广泛注意，因为它符合于各国人民的愿望，对于促进国际信任气氛，从而推动裁军问题的讨论和解决，都是有很大的帮助的。
    但是，人们看到，为寻求大家可以接受的裁军问题的方案而进行工作的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会，自从复会以来，却没有获得人们所期待的结果。其中原因，就是由于美国代表把裁减武装部队和军备以及禁止原子武器的问题完全搁在一边，而只是表示希望首先而且主要来讨论美国关于苏联同美国互相交换军事情报以及在两国领土上空互相进行空中摄影的建议。这样，小组委员会的工作就遇到了阻碍。这种情况是不符合各国人民的愿望的，应该改变这种状况。
    布尔加宁主席的信件和莫洛托夫外长的建议，为打开目前在裁军问题上的僵局指出了道路。有关方面以及联合国大会要考虑苏联政府提出的这些意见和建议，这样，才能在裁军问题上求得进展。
    各国人民要求裁减军备，是为了消除新战争的威胁，并减轻压在他们身上的过重的军备负担。因此，在这个问题上首要的任务是停止扩充军备、裁减武装部队和军备。苏联五月十日提出的裁军建议是实现上述目的的切实可行的方案。美国、英国和法国也已提出了它们的有关裁军的建议。所有这些建议，都应该加以郑重研究。美国代表在联合国裁军委员会小组委员会中只希望首先主要讨论美国的建议，这种态度没有表现出寻求合作谅解的精神。并且，美国的建议只涉及苏美两国交换军事情报以及在两国领土上空进行空中摄影的问题，而对于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的必要性只字未提。显然，如果不采取直接的裁军措施而实行美国的建议，是绝不能停止扩充军备，也绝不能消除新战争的威胁的。而且，它还会使人们对由于扩充军备而产生的破坏和平的威胁放松警惕。美国“新闻日报”在九月八日评论美国的建议时也承认：“这个计划不是以裁军为目的，而是为了维持和巩固目前军备的极端水平。这个计划将不会影响毁灭性的氢弹的大量储存的继续发展。”
    布尔加宁主席在他给艾森豪威尔的信中指出：国与国间在一定的阶段相互交换军事情报是必要的，但是最好是所有国家，而不仅是苏美两国，把这类情报（包括常规军备和核子军备）提供给通过达成协议而建立的国际监督和视察机构。并且，只有在裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施达成协议的情况下，上述情报的提交给国际监督和视察机构才是有意义的事情。至于在两国领土上空进行空中摄影的问题，布尔加宁主席指出，这个建议把在苏美两国境外的武装部队和军事设施完全略而不提。如果把这种措施扩大到其他国家领土上的所有的武装部队和军事设施，这就要引起一个新的问题：其他国家是否允许外国飞机在他们拥有主权的领土上空进行空中摄影呢？因此，在目前的情况下，这并不是一个能够促进实现裁军方面取得有效进展的问题。
    为了促进裁军问题的进展，应该在大家已经一致或者大大接近的那些问题上取得共同的协议。大家知道，在苏联五月十日提出建议以后，苏联和西方国家对于大国武装部队的水平问题以及关于禁止使用原子武器的问题是有着共同的观点的，并且各国也都已经承认，现在采取有助于防止一个国家突然袭击另一个国家的措施，对保障国际和平和安全具有重大意义。而在这方面，苏联也已经提出了在可能集中大兵团和战斗装备的大港口、铁路枢纽、公路干线和飞机场建立监察所的建议。由此可见，各国如真正具有实现裁减军备的诚意，那末，在上述的问题上达成协议是不应该有什么困难的。在这种情况下，如果谁还不肯向这个方面认真努力，那就不能不使人认为他们是不愿意促进裁减军备的实现的。布尔加宁主席的信件和莫洛托夫外长在联合国大会的建议，使西方国家，特别是美国面临着严重的考验。
    各国人民不仅要求各国在裁军问题上，而且也在解决其他迫切的国际问题上都能表现出“日内瓦精神”。莫洛托夫外长在联合国大会的演说中也提出了建立欧洲集体安全体系、解决远东和亚洲悬而未决问题以及联合国组织对进一步和缓国际紧张局势的任务的意见。这些问题如果都能够本着合作谅解的精神求得解决，就会大大有助于加强和平和国际合作。
    联合国对于进一步和缓国际紧张局势和加强国际合作负有重大的责任，它应当在解决裁军问题上以及其他悬而未决的国际问题上说出有分量的话，以实现各国人民的愿望。中国人民热烈拥护布尔加宁主席在给艾森豪威尔的信中对裁军问题所提出的意见，并且完全支持莫洛托夫外长九月二十三日在联合国大会上提出的建议。联合国通过苏联的建议，将是符合各国人民的切身利益的。
