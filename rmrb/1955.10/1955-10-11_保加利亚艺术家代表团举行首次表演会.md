Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Bulgarian Artists Delegation held its first music and dance performance tonight at the Tianqiao Theater. Their outstanding performances were warmly welcomed and appreciated by artists and people from all walks of life in the capital.

　　The evening began with a solo by soprano Radeva. Radeva is a winner of the Second Bulgarian Vocalists and Instrumentalists Competition, a winner of the World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship in Bucharest, and a recipient of the "Prague Spring" prize. Tonight, she sang a total of four songs, one of which was the Chinese folk song "Lan Hua Hua" sung in Chinese. After enthusiastic applause from the audience, she sang another song as an encore.

　　Subsequently, the Bulgarian artists performed nine more programs including solo vocals, violin solos, folk instrument solos, and ballet, each of which was a great success.

　　The solo performance by Bulgarian People's Republic People's Artist, Dimitrov Prize winner, and soloist Popov, was received with extremely warm welcome. Popov sang a total of five songs, including Schubert's "The Wanderer," Ivan Susanin's aria from Glinka's opera "Ivan Susanin," and Mussorgsky's "Song of the Flea." Popov, with his superhuman vocal cultivation, accurately conveyed the rich content of the songs he performed to the audience with his spacious and loud voice and beautiful tone. He took seven curtain calls to the enthusiastic welcome of the audience and sang an encore.

　　Popov is one of the most outstanding actors in the People's Republic of Bulgaria. He has played forty-five different roles with different personalities and different tones in operas. He has toured in many cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, Paris, Budapest, Vienna, Prague, and Belgrade.

　　At the evening, the violin solo by Dimitrov Prize winner and World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship in Bucharest winner Lechev, the solo by Second Bulgarian Vocalists and Instrumentalists Competition winner, World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship in Bucharest winner, soprano Venier, the folk instrument solo by Blagoev, and the Bulgarian folk songs sung by Karaymonov all won the appreciation of the audience.

　　The last program of the performance was the ballet "Youth Waltz" performed by World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship in Bucharest winners Korchakova and Gavrilov. This was a youth dance full of the joy of life, which showed that the young people of Bulgaria not only know how to work well, but also know how to have fun. Prior to this program, Korchakova and Gavrilov also performed the ballet "Meeting in Spring." In this dance, the performers vividly portrayed the love of young people in the season of spring with gentle and skillful movements. Korchakova also performed "The Dying Swan" alone. Both dances were performed again after the curtain calls.

　　At the end of the performance, the whole theater resounded with prolonged applause. The Bulgarian artists received flowers presented by young literary and art workers in the capital.
