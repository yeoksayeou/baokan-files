Xinhua News Agency report: Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China received the entire Burmese Buddhist Delegation on the afternoon of the 1st.

Present at the reception were: Chen Yi, Vice Premier of the State Council; Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General; Zhang Zhizhiang, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court; Chen Jiakang, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs; He Chengxiang, Director of the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council; Zhao Puchu, Vice President and Secretary-General of the Chinese Buddhist Association; and Zheng Zhenduo, President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association.

U Hla Maung, Ambassador of the Union of Burma to China, was also present at the reception.

Another report: The Chinese Buddhist Association, the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association jointly held a banquet on the afternoon of the 1st to welcome the Burmese Buddhist Delegation headed by U Tin Maung.

U Win, head of the Burmese Cultural Delegation, Deputy Head U Than Sein, and other members of the delegation, as well as U Hla Maung, the Burmese Ambassador to China, were also invited to attend the banquet.

Zhao Puchu, Vice President and Secretary-General of the Chinese Buddhist Association, delivered a welcoming speech at the banquet, followed by a speech by Head of Delegation U Tin Maung.

Another report: When the Burmese Buddhist Delegation arrived in Beijing, the head of the delegation, U Tin Maung, delivered a speech at the airport. He first said:

    I and my delegation members express our heartfelt gratitude for your warm welcome and accept your kindness.

He then pointed out: The people of Burma and China have consistently held goodwill and friendship. The Premier of the People's Republic of China has visited the Union of Burma twice and held intimate talks and discussions with the President of the Union, Prime Minister U Nu, and other leaders. The Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Nu, has also visited the People's Republic of China and held intimate talks with the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Premier of the State Council, and other national leaders of the People's Republic of China.

He said: The talks and discussions between China and Burma have laid a solid foundation for the friendship between the two countries and for the peaceful and prosperous development of both countries.

He concluded: In the context of mutual understanding between our two countries, the People's Republic of China has sent a Buddhist delegation to visit Burma, and at the same time, I and my delegation members have come to the People's Republic of China to prepare to welcome the Buddha's tooth enshrined in Beijing for veneration in Burma. This not only demonstrates that the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma have reached a further understanding in the above aspects, but also clearly demonstrates that the two countries are fellow Buddhists in their religious beliefs, and that China and Burma are able to advance side by side in developing Buddhist doctrines and using Buddhist doctrines to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

    我国佛教协会等单位宴请缅甸佛教代表团
    据新华社讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来一日下午接见了缅甸联邦佛教代表团全体人员。
    接见时在座的有：国务院副总理陈毅，秘书长习仲勋，最高人民法院副院长张志让，外交部部长助理陈家康，国务院宗教事务局局长何成湘，中国佛教协会副会长兼秘书长赵朴初，中缅友好协会会长郑振铎。
    接见时，缅甸联邦驻华大使吴拉茂也在座。
    又讯　中国佛教协会、中华人民共和国国务院宗教事务局、中缅友好协会在一日下午联合举行宴会，欢迎以吴登貌为首的缅甸联邦佛教代表团。
    缅甸联邦文化代表团团长吴温、副团长吴丹盛及代表团其他人员，缅甸驻中国大使吴拉茂也应邀出席了宴会。
    中国佛教协会副会长兼秘书长赵朴初在宴会上致欢迎词，吴登貌团长接着讲了话。
    又讯　缅甸联邦佛教代表团到达北京时，代表团团长吴登貌在飞机场致词。他首先说：
    我和我的团员对你们给我们这样热烈的欢迎表示衷心感谢并接受你们给我的盛意。
    接着他指出：缅甸人民和中国一贯地怀着善意和友好。中华人民共和国总理曾经到缅甸联邦访问过两次，并且和联邦总统及吴努总理等首长进行过亲密的谈话和讨论。缅甸联邦总理吴努也曾经访问过中华人民共和国，并且和中华人民共和国的主席、副主席以及人民代表大会常务委员会委员长、国务院总理等国家领导人进行过亲密的谈话。
    他说：中缅两国的交谈和讨论对于中缅两国的友谊和两国的和平和繁荣发展奠定了巩固的基础。
    他最后说：在我们两国的互相了解的情况下，中华人民共和国派遣了佛教代表团访问了缅甸，同时我和我的团员们也来到了中华人民共和国，准备奉迎供奉在北京的佛牙到缅甸瞻仰供奉。这不仅说明中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦共和国在以上各方面已经有了进一步的了解，还非常明显地说明了两国在佛教信仰上也是教友，在发展佛教的教义和以佛教的教义来保卫亚洲和世界的和平上，中缅两国是能够并肩前进的。
