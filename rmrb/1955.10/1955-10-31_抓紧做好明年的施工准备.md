Seize the Time to Prepare for Construction Next Year

Zhang Jianfeng, Deputy Director of the Planning and Statistics Department of the Ministry of Construction Engineering

1956 is a year that will play a decisive role in completing the First Five-Year Plan. The vast majority of the 156 projects will commence construction this year. Their scale is vast, their structure complex, and their quality requirements are high. Without seizing the time to prepare for construction, it will be impossible to smoothly complete these arduous construction tasks.

“Make good preparations before construction” was proposed several years ago. However, due to insufficient understanding of the importance of this work by many construction departments, and because the design work each year has failed to meet the needs of construction, the vast majority of construction units have left this practical and specific task at the level of general appeals, or confined to some trivial administrative affairs. They have given little thought to how to ensure timely commencement of construction or advance the start date, or how to guarantee the smooth completion of tasks after construction begins. The First Automobile Factory project is a particularly prominent example. This project involved providing drawings and commencing construction simultaneously. The construction unit was unable to even ascertain the total tasks to be completed throughout the year, so the reserves of materials, the allocation of labor, and the addition of machinery and equipment lacked a solid basis. The project had been underway for a long time, but there was still no overall plan. The setting up of auxiliary processing plants and the on-site water supply, power supply, and drainage could not be uniformly arranged in advance. After construction began, there were shortages of everything. Work was suspended today due to this issue, and tomorrow due to that issue, intermittently disrupting operations. The enterprise's management work fell into a state of chaos and passivity, seriously wasting state funds.

We must not repeat the lessons of the First Automobile Factory project. Unfortunately, some people are now even touting similar lessons as advanced experiences everywhere, saying things like "Construction doesn't need any preparation at all. We completed the task of building such-and-such factory without any preparation work before”; or "Construction preparation doesn't take much time. Today we get the drawings, and tomorrow we can start construction." In reality, this is advocating for the abolition of construction preparation work. If this argument were correct, then how would we explain the famous Soviet saying in construction engineering: "Three years of preparation, one year to complete; one year of preparation, three years to complete"? Those who advocate for abolishing construction preparation work only know how to compress the construction period, but they don't realize that only by fully preparing for construction is it possible to compress the construction period. Otherwise, not only will the construction period not be compressed, but it will also disrupt the enterprise's balanced production and cause serious adverse consequences for the country.

Contrary to the argument of abolishing construction preparation work, some people are mystifying and absolutizing construction preparation work. They believe that all projects, regardless of size, require three months of construction preparation time, even repairing a toilet is no exception, thus extending the construction period and hindering construction units from completing their investment plans on time. This is a conservative ideology. We believe that it is essential to prepare thoroughly before construction and strictly adhere to construction procedures. That is, all projects that commence construction must have a certain reserve of drawings. However, the amount of time required for construction preparation for each project should not be generalized. Some may be shorter, and some may be longer. This depends on the specific circumstances of the construction department and also on the needs of production tasks. Special circumstances can be specially handled with the approval of both competent authorities. In short, each construction unit must accelerate construction preparation work, strive to commence construction ahead of schedule, and complete construction tasks ahead of schedule.

Doing a good job in construction preparation is the common task of both construction units and construction entities. To do a good job in construction preparation for 1956, both parties should immediately carry out the following tasks.

I. Conscientiously compile the annual plan for 1956. The annual plan is the action program for the whole year and the basis for all preparation work. Its accuracy is closely related to the quality of construction preparation work. Every construction and installation enterprise must immediately ascertain the task situation for next year, especially the arrival status of design drawings, as this is the main basis for compiling the annual plan. Many construction and installation enterprises did not ascertain the arrival status of design drawings when accepting tasks for 1955, and were unsure of the overall situation, resulting in frequent changes to the annual plan after it was compiled. In some units, the final revised task was reduced by about 40% compared to the initially determined plan, resulting in a large accumulation of materials, the failure of funds to circulate quickly, the inability to fully utilize machinery and equipment, and a large amount of labor being idle. The main reasons for this phenomenon, apart from some special circumstances in individual projects, from the perspective of the construction entities, was the excessive entrustment of tasks, assigning construction units project tasks for which even the planning task book had not been approved, or even for which the location had not been determined. From the perspective of the construction units, it was a case of "grasping at straws" when accepting tasks, incorporating any task into the plan as long as it was available. To avoid this phenomenon from recurring in 1956, construction and installation enterprises must closely contact construction entities and conscientiously ascertain the task situation. All projects to be constructed next year must be those for which a preliminary design has already been completed this year, with a date for the completion of the technical design, and with construction detailed drawings to be submitted no later than September next year. Otherwise, they will not be included in next year's plan. In order to compile a good plan for next year, construction and installation enterprises must also, in the spirit of neither being reckless nor conservative, propose various recommended indicators for 1956. These indicators should be average advanced ones, achievable through the efforts of the workers. Only a plan compiled on the basis of doing these two tasks well can guide construction.

II. Rectify the organization and adjust forces. The projects to be constructed in 1956 are mostly factory projects belonging to the 156 projects. The organizational form of the old construction and installation enterprises is no longer fully adapted to the needs of the new tasks. All construction and installation enterprises should, in the spirit of streamlining institutions, review the existing enterprise organizational structure and, according to the requirements of the new tasks, merge where necessary, and strengthen where necessary. It is necessary to overcome the shortcomings of too many layers, a large organization, and ineffective command, and replenish the lower levels with the transferred personnel to strengthen grassroots construction organizations. All units must also propose a plan for balancing labor forces based on the task situation. In order to adapt to the needs of large-scale industrial construction next year, it is necessary to further improve the technical and professional capabilities of grassroots cadres, and, without affecting winter construction or the "Suppression of Counterrevolutionaries" work, organize short-term training courses. The content of the training should be concise and精, so that everyone can learn and use it to solve problems next year.

III. Seize the time to arrange the construction site. In the newly built factory areas, construction units should, according to the determined overall progress, urge construction entities and design units to provide relevant information, conduct unified planning, and, according to the unified planning, conduct construction organization design. Clear regulations should be made on issues such as how to supply information and how construction units and design units should cooperate, to avoid the phenomenon of no one being responsible. When carrying out the overall site planning, efforts should be made to utilize formal engineering or municipal construction projects as much as possible, so as to save a large amount of state funds. When carrying out the construction organization design, efforts should be made to make the construction conditions design as early as possible, so as to arrange the site early, and strive to build important processing plants and transportation arteries before the end of the year. At the same time, technical and economic reconnaissance work should be immediately strengthened, and the resources near the base should be utilized as much as possible, which is the key to reducing costs.

IV. Do a good job in the supply of materials and machinery. This is one of the important contents of construction preparation work. In the past, what often affected the progress of projects, in addition to the failure of drawings to arrive on time, was the poor preparation of materials and machinery. Therefore, all units should conduct a comprehensive and thorough inventory of accumulated materials within the year to clarify which are reserve materials for next year and which must be disposed of immediately. All construction units should promptly request local governments to allocate local materials according to the needs of the task, and take advantage of the winter slack season to seize the time to store and transport various materials. Supply plans should be made for all materials according to the needs of construction tasks. The construction machinery and special materials required for factory construction next year are equally important. All units should prioritize the ordering and balancing and dispatching of these two items.

V. In order to act in accordance with construction procedures, construction contracts must be signed as early as possible; in cases where various materials are incomplete but construction must be started quickly, an agreement must be signed. In the past, some projects were almost completed without a contract being signed, so that the responsibilities of both parties were never clear during construction, leading to mutual buck-passing. Next year, a principle must be adhered to: all projects to be constructed must commence construction only after a contract or agreement has been signed. This not only guarantees the completion of the task, but also avoids unnecessary disputes between both parties after construction begins.

1956 is a year of construction on new industrial bases. Construction preparation work is not only urgent in terms of time, but also extremely difficult and complex in terms of conditions. This requires all construction and installation enterprises and all construction entities to give play to their subjective initiative, help each other, supervise each other, and strive to better complete next year's construction plan.

    抓紧做好明年的施工准备
    建筑工程部计划统计司副司长　张剑锋
    一九五六年是对完成第一个五年建设计划起决定作用的一年。属于一五六项的绝大部分工程都要在这一年开工。它们的规模浩大，结构复杂，质量要求高，不争取时间作好施工准备，就不能顺利地完成这些艰巨的施工任务。
    “要作好施工前的准备工作”，这在几年前就提出来了。但由于许多施工部门对这一工作的重要性认识不足，由于每年的设计工作都不能满足施工的需要，绝大多数的施工单位都把这一实际而又具体的工作停留在一般的号召上，停留在一些琐碎的行政事务工作上，对如何保证按期开工或提前开工，如何保证开工后能够顺利地完成任务，考虑得很少。第一汽车厂工程是一个比较突出的例子。这个工程是一面到图，一面施工的。施工单位连全年要完成多少任务都摸不清楚，所以材料的储备、劳动力的调配、机械设备的添置等，都没有切实的依据。工程已经开工很久，还没有一个整体规划，附属加工厂的设置、现场供水、供电、排水等工作都不能在事先统一安排。开工后缺东缺西，今天因这样停工，明天因那样停工，时作时辍，企业的经营管理工作陷于忙乱和被动状态，严重地浪费了国家资金。
    第一汽车厂工程的教训，我们决不能重复了。可惜的是，现在竟然有人把类似的教训当成先进经验到处宣扬，说什么“施工根本不需要准备，我们以前盖某某厂没有准备工作也完成了任务”；说什么“施工准备不需要多少时间，今天到图，明天就可以施工”。实际上，这是取消施工准备工作。如果这种论调是对的话，那末苏联在建筑工程上有一句名言：“三年准备，一年完成；一年准备，三年完成”又作何解释呢？主张取消施工准备工作的人只知道压缩工期，但不知只有充分做好施工准备才有可能压缩工期，否则，不但不能压缩工期，而且还要打乱企业的均衡生产，给国家造成严重的不良后果。
    同主张取消施工准备工作的论调相反，有的人把施工准备工作神秘化，绝对化。他们认为不论大小工程都要三个月的施工准备时间，连修一个厕所也不能例外，因而把工期拉得很长，妨碍建设单位按时完成投资计划。这是一种保守思想。我们认为开工前一定要作好准备，严格遵守施工程序。即凡开工的工程都要有一定的图纸储备量。但是每一项工程的施工准备需要多少时间，决不能一概而论，有的可能短些，有的可能长些，这一方面要看施工部门的具体情况，另一方面也要看生产任务的需要。特殊的情况在得到双方主管部门批准以后可作特殊处理。总之，每个施工单位都必须加速施工准备工作，争取提前开工，提前完成施工任务。
    做好施工准备工作，是建设单位和施工单位的共同任务，为了做好一九五六年的施工准备工作，双方应立即进行以下几项工作。
    一、认真编制一九五六年的年计划。年计划是全年的行动纲领，是一切准备工作的依据，它的准确与否对于施工准备工作的好坏有密切的关系。每一个建筑安装企业都要立即摸清明年任务情况，尤其摸清设计图纸的到达情况，因为这是编制年计划的主要依据。许多建筑安装企业在接受一九五五年的任务时，没摸清设计图纸的到达情况，心中无数，年计划编成后变化频繁。有的单位最后一次修正的任务竟比第一次订的计划减少百分之四十左右，因而造成材料大量积压，资金不能迅速周转，机械设备不能充分利用，劳动力大量窝工。产生这种现象的主要原因，除个别工程有些特殊情况外，从建设单位来说，就是在委托任务的时候贪多，把一些连计划任务书都没有批准的、甚至连地址都没定的工程任务，也委托给施工单位。从施工单位来说，就是在接受任务的时候“饥不择食”，只要有任务就编入计划。为了避免一九五六年再发生这种现象，建筑安装企业必须同建设单位密切联系，认真地摸清任务情况。凡明年施工的工程，必须是今年已经有了初步设计，有完成技术设计的日期，施工详图至迟在明年九月份前交出的工程。否则概不列入明年的计划。为了编好明年的计划，建筑安装企业还要本着既不冒进又不保守的精神，提出一九五六年的各种建议指标，这些指标应该是平均先进的，经过职工的努力所能达到的。只有在作好这两项工作的基础上编出来的计划才能指导施工。
    二、整顿组织，调整力量。一九五六年施工的工程，大都是属于一五六项的厂房工程，旧的建筑安装企业的组织形式已经不能完全适应于新任务的需要了。各建筑安装企业应根据精简机构的精神，检查一次现有的企业组织机构，根据新的任务要求，应该合并的合并，应该加强的加强，要克服层次过多，机构庞大，指挥不灵的毛病，把抽调出来的人员充实下层，加强基层施工组织。各单位也要根据任务情况，提出平衡劳动力的方案。为了适应明年大规模工业建设的需要，必须把基层干部的技术能力和业务能力提高一步，在不影响冬季施工，不影响“肃反”工作的情况下，组织短期的训练班。训练的内容要少而精，使大家学了就能用以解决明年的问题。
    三、抓紧布置施工场地。在新建厂的地区，施工单位应根据已确定的总进度督促建设单位和设计单位提供有关资料，进行统一规划，根据统一规划进行施工组织设计。对于资料如何供应，施工单位和设计单位如何配合等问题，都应该作出明确规定，免得产生无人负责现象。在进行现场总体规划的时候，应该尽量利用正式工程或市政建设工程，这样可以大量节省国家资金。在进行施工组织设计的时候，要争取提早作出施工条件设计，以便早日布置场地，争取年前把重要的加工厂和交通要道修起来。同时应立即加强技术经济勘察工作，尽量利用基地附近的资源，这是降低成本的要道。
    四、作好材料机械的供应工作。这是施工准备工作的重要内容之一。过去，经常影响工程进度的，除了图纸不能按期到达外，就是材料和机械准备不好。因此，各单位应在年内全面地彻底地清理一次积存材料，弄清哪些是明年的储备材料，哪些必须立即进行处理。各施工单位要及时地根据任务的需要请地方政府调拨地方材料，并利用冬闲抓紧各种材料的储运工作。对于全部材料，都要根据施工任务的需要做出供应计划。明年厂房工程所需的施工机械和特殊材料同样重要，各单位应把这两项东西的订货工作和平衡调度工作提到第一位来。
    五、为了按照施工程序办事，必须及早签订施工合同；在各种资料不齐备而又必须迅速开工的情况下，必须签订协议书。过去，有的工程快完工了还没有订立合同，以致在施工过程中，甲乙方的责任始终不清，互相扯皮。明年必须坚持一个原则：凡是要施工的工程，必须是在签订合同或协议书后才开工。这样作不仅对完成任务有保证，而且可以避免甲乙双方在开工后发生一些不必要的纠纷。
    一九五六年，是在新的工业基地上进行施工的一年。施工准备工作不仅在时间上是紧迫的，而且在条件上是极其困难而复杂的。这就需要各建筑安装企业、各建设单位发挥主观能动性，互相帮助，互相监督，为更好地完成明年的施工计划而奋斗。
