    A Revolutionary Disabled Soldier Who Loves the Cause of Agricultural Cooperativization
    Zhu Heting
    Li Dejin, the vice-chairman of the Sangyuan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wanggezhuang Township, Qingdao City Suburbs, Shandong Province, is a revolutionary disabled soldier who is blind in both eyes. Like other revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers, Li Dejin, due to his infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause and his love for the working people, has continuously strived in his new construction post and made excellent achievements.
    Sangyuan Village is located in a mountain ravine on the eastern coast of Laoshan Mountain. In the past, the farmers in this area mostly relied on planting terraced fields and collecting firewood to maintain their livelihoods. At that time, Li Dejin had no land and worked as a shoemaker, supporting himself and his family with his own hands. After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders occupied Qingdao, burning, killing, and looting, making it impossible for him to produce at home. Through a friend's introduction, he went to the Xintai Coal Mine. Life in the coal mine was equally tragic. Workers were forced to labor like slaves, guarded by military police, and surrounded by electric fences. Hunger often took the lives of workers, and accidents were constant. In the summer of 1943, a major plague killed even more workers, and Li Dejin also contracted the disease. His wife cared for him through hunger and cold, but unfortunately, she and their child contracted the plague and soon died. During these days of suffering, the workers often came to ask about his well-being, but the Japanese and the "foreman" never looked at them. A worker named Zhu Yunhan, whose entire family of three died in the plague that year, had a few tattered padded jackets left unsold and gave two of them to Li Dejin to help him get through the severe winter.
    At this time, Li Dejin realized that in this kind of society, workers and peasants could not survive by labor alone; to survive, they needed to struggle. But at that time, he did not have a clear direction for the struggle.
    In 1945, the Japanese invaders announced their surrender to the Chinese people, and the Kuomintang made a comeback, riding on the backs of the people. Li Dejin realized that under the rule of the Kuomintang, he would still be oppressed and enslaved, so he joined the Eighth Route Army with other workers and was soon assigned to the Eighth Column of the East China Field Army. The Party's education and the experience of war rapidly enhanced his class consciousness, and he gradually grew into a true people's soldier, displaying great bravery in battle. In the autumn of 1947, Kuomintang bandits launched a frenzied offensive against the people of Luzhong. In one battle, Li Dejin used a machine gun to strafe the enemy at close range, killing or wounding twenty or thirty of them, until he himself was wounded in the head, lost too much blood, and lost consciousness before stopping the fight. Because of his brave and resourceful performance in this battle, he was praised by the East China Military Region Headquarters and was awarded first-class merit in combat. In the autumn of 1948, he participated in the Huaihai Campaign. By this time, he was a Communist Party member. During a fierce battle in which our army attacked a hilltop, he led a machine gun squad to cover the soldiers' charge. A shell exploded beside him. This injury completely disqualified him from continuing to work in the army. In the hospital, his injured left eye was removed. And before his right eye had fully recovered, he repeatedly requested to leave the hospital. From then on, he ended his military combat life. In several years of fighting, he earned six merits in combat and one merit in work for the people.
    After several transfer procedures, Li Dejin returned to his original workplace—the newly liberated Xintai Coal Mine. The workers warmly welcomed him, and the factory took great care of him. The changes in the factory moved him, and he worked day and night on the work assigned to him. Unfortunately, his right eye became inflamed again, and after rest and treatment, he was finally unable to continue working. He was extremely distressed, feeling that it was wrong to take the people's supplies and receive the organization's care without being able to work. He decided to return to the countryside to participate in production, feeling that his limbs were still sound and he could still vaguely see a little with his right eye, so he could still participate in agricultural production.
    In this way, he firmly declined the factory's attempts to keep him and returned to his long-separated hometown in May 1951. He saw his elderly mother again, but his young son no longer recognized Li Dejin as his father.
    After returning to his hometown, Li Dejin actively participated in various tasks. His active and responsible spirit in his work quickly won the support of the masses and he was elected as the vice director of the Peasant Association. He led the peasants to complete the work of ending the land reform, busying himself day and night mobilizing the masses. The excessive labor of his work caused his left eye to become inflamed frequently, and his right eye's vision deteriorated day by day. But he did not care about these things. In his work, he led the masses to fairly and reasonably resolve the remaining problems in the land reform, and his family was also allotted eight mu of land.
    As soon as the land reform work was completed, he responded to the Party's call and actively organized mutual aid teams. By 1953, the mutual aid team he led had expanded to twenty-five households, and a flour mill had been established to carry out sideline production. This flour mill not only enabled surplus labor within the team to be put into production, increasing the income of the team members, but also accumulated fertilizer for the farmland. That year, the yield of crops in his mutual aid team far exceeded that of ordinary mutual aid teams. Their corn averaged 400 jin per mu, double the yield of ordinary mutual aid teams.
    But in the second half of that year, Li Dejin lost all vision in his right eye; a life of complete blindness loomed before him.
    Li Dejin did not shrink back in the face of this misfortune. He continued to work as usual, attend meetings, and study with the cadres. In 1954, after full study and deliberation, Sangyuan Village established its first agricultural production cooperative. The members elected Li Dejin as the director of the cooperative. But because he lost the ability to lead production in the fields, with the research and approval of the CCP District Committee, he was approved to serve as the vice director. Li Dejin was completely satisfied with this task.
    In leading the production of the agricultural cooperative, he often wondered how he could see the crops in the cooperative like a person with sight, otherwise it would be difficult for him to draw correct conclusions just by listening to others talk about how hard-working the production teams were. One day, he finally came up with a solution. When he heard the cooperative members say that sweet potatoes were being densely planted according to advanced experience, he asked a little girl to lead him to the mountains, groping to check the distance between plants to understand the degree of dense planting of the sweet potatoes. Later, he often went to the fields to feel the density of the grain seedlings, whether the corn seedlings were emerging evenly. By feeling the height of the pea vines, he could roughly judge whether they were growing well or not.
    Not long after the agricultural cooperative was established, phenomena such as wasting time and absenteeism appeared. This was the biggest problem hindering production at the time. How to solve it? Li Dejin was eager to find a solution. Every time he attended the meeting of the directors of agricultural production cooperatives held in the district, he carefully listened to the experience of other cooperatives in solving this problem. Once, he heard the director of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative talk about the experience of implementing contracted work. After returning to the village, he immediately visited the old farmers in the cooperative to study how much manure could be delivered to a certain plot of land in half a day, how much labor was needed to plant certain crops on a certain plot of land, and so on, and sent a production team to conduct field experiments. Finally, the cooperative committee implemented a contracted work system based on the location of the land, the difficulty of cultivation, and other conditions. In this way, the problem of wasting time and absenteeism was solved. In the past, some members were absent from work and did not observe time, but now they go to the fields to work before dawn. In the past, some members earned ten points a day, but now they can earn twelve points. Members can generally complete their tasks on time.
    Li Dejin not only worked hard, but also cared about the lives of the masses. He never forgot what the leaders of the army told him:
  "Communist Party members must unite the masses at all times and become models of caring for the masses and for work." His experiences in the old society gave him a deep class feeling for the working people, and he regarded not caring about the hardships of the masses as a crime. During the Spring Festival in 1952, the village sent pork to comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs, and he gave his share (his eldest son was in the People's Liberation Army) to a poor military family with no labor force. Once, he learned that the widow Li Chenshi had no firewood to cook, so he asked his children to take food from his own home to her. Before the Spring Festival in 1954, he visited each member's family to ask if they had any difficulties during the Spring Festival. The member Li Kesheng lacked three yuan to spend the Spring Festival, and he lent him the three yuan from his pocket. It is precisely because Li Dejin loves and cares for the masses that he enjoys a high prestige among the masses. If some peasant families have disagreements or other problems, they are willing to ask Li Dejin to solve them. In 1952 alone, he mediated ten marriage disputes.
    After Li Dejin became blind, although he continued to work actively for the Party, using Paul Korchagin and Wu Yunduo as his role models, he encountered many difficulties in his work. When the state monopoly of grain purchase and sale was implemented in 1953, Li Dejin had just gone blind and was not used to using a walking stick. When walking or going out, he often bumped his head or fell. One night, he and another demobilized construction soldier went out to work in the rain. On the way, he accidentally fell and cut his leg, which bled profusely. He did not make a sound, got up and continued walking as usual. The road was very muddy at that time, and his shoes were often stuck in the mud. He simply took off his shoes and went barefoot to the peasants' homes to publicize the grain policy. Through the publicity of Li Dejin and other cadres, the peasants actively sold their surplus grain to the state. Usually in his work, he can also unite everyone, and solicit everyone's opinions on any issue.
    Communist Party member and revolutionary disabled soldier Comrade Li Dejin is thus overcoming various difficulties in his body and in his work, and is working actively with the peasants of the whole village for the development of production and for the realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture. Now, out of the seventy-three households in Sangyuan Village, excluding one landlord household, one rich peasant household, and widowed and orphaned people who have lost their ability to work, seventy households of peasants have participated in agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The indomitable and noble qualities of Comrade Li Dejin's struggle for the revolutionary cause illuminates this mountain village.

    一个热爱农业合作化事业的革命残废军人
    朱和亭
    山东省青岛市郊区王戈庄乡桑园村农业生产合作社副社长李德进是一个双目失明的革命残废军人。李德进同其他革命残废军人和复员建设军人一样，由于对革命事业无限忠诚，对劳动人民充满热爱，他在新的建设岗位上不断努力，做出了很好的成绩。
    桑园村座落在崂山东部临海的一个山涧里。这一带的农民过去多是依靠种点梯田、打点山柴维持生活。那时李德进没有土地，当一个鞋匠，用自己的双手养活自己和全家。抗日战争开始以后，日寇侵占了青岛，烧杀掠夺，使他不能在家生产，经朋友介绍，他辗转到了新泰煤矿。煤矿的生活同样是悲惨的，工人像奴隶一样被强迫劳动着，宪兵在一旁看守着，煤矿周围安装着电网。饥饿经常夺去工人的生命，伤亡事故不断发生。一九四三年夏天，一场大瘟疫死亡了更多的工人，李德进也染上了疫病。他的爱人在饥寒交迫中把他护养好了，不幸她自己和孩子又患上了瘟疫，不久她就死去了。在这病苦的日子里，工人们常来问长问短，但日本人和“把头”谁也没有看他们一眼。一个叫朱云汉的工人，在这年瘟疫中全家死去三口人，剩下几件破烂夹衣没有卖完，送给李德进两件，帮助他度过了严冬。
    这时的李德进觉悟到，在这种社会里，工人、农民光凭劳动是不能生活下去的；要活下去，就需要斗争。但是那时他没有明确的斗争方向。
    一九四五年，日寇向中国人民宣告投降，国民党又卷土重来，骑在人民头上。李德进察觉到在国民党统治下，仍然是被压迫被奴役，于是他就和其他工人一起参加了八路军，不久就被编到当时的华东野战军第八纵队。党的教育和战争的锻炼迅速地提高了他的阶级觉悟，他渐渐成长为一个真正的人民战士，在战斗中表现得非常英勇。一九四七年秋天，国民党匪徒向鲁中人民发起疯狂的进攻。在一次战斗中，李德进用一挺机枪在最近距离扫射敌人，杀伤敌人二、三十个，直到他自己头部负伤、流血过多昏迷过去，才停止战斗。由于他在这次战斗中表现得英勇机智，他受到了华东军区司令部的表扬，被评为战斗中的一等功臣。一九四八年秋天，他又参加了淮海战役。这时他已是共产党员。在我军进攻一个山头的激烈战斗中，他领着一个机枪班掩护战士们冲锋。一颗炮弹在他身旁爆炸了。这次负伤使他完全失去了继续在部队工作的条件。在医院里，割去了他被炸伤的左眼。而当右眼还没有痊愈的时候，他又再三请求离开了医院。从此他结束了军事战斗生活。在几年的战斗中，他为人民立了六次战功和一次工作功。
    经过几次的转移手续，李德进回到了原来工作的地方——已经解放的新泰煤矿。工人们热烈地欢迎他，工厂对他照顾得十分周到。工厂的变化感动了他，他不分昼夜地做着分配给他的工作。不幸他的右眼又发炎了，经过休养和治疗，也终于不能再坚持工作。他痛苦极了，觉得自己不能工作而拿着人民的供给，又受到组织的照顾，那是不行的。他决定回到农村去参加生产，他觉得自己四肢还健全，右眼还模模糊糊地能看见一点东西，参加农业生产还是可以的。
    就这样，他坚决谢绝了工厂对他的挽留，在一九五一年五月回到了自己久别的故乡。他重新见到了年老的母亲，但他的小儿子已不认得李德进是自己的爸爸了。
    李德进回到家乡以后就积极参加了各项工作。他在工作中积极负责的精神，很快就得到群众的拥护，并被选为农会副主任。他领导着农民进行结束土地改革的工作，日夜不息地忙着发动群众。工作的过分劳累，使他的左眼经常发炎，而右眼的视力也一天不如一天。但他并没有顾及这些。在工作中，他领导群众公平合理地处理了土地改革中的遗留问题，他家也分得了八亩土地。
    土地改革工作刚刚结束，他就响应党的号召，积极组织起互助组。到一九五三年，他领导的互助组扩大到二十五户，而且建立了一座粉房，进行副业生产。这座粉房一方面可以使组内剩余劳动力投入生产，增加组员收入，而且也为农田积下了肥料。这年他这个互助组作物的产量远远超过了一般互助组，他们的苞米平均每亩产四百斤，比一般互助组多产一倍。
    可是就在这一年的下半年，李德进那只右眼也一点视力都没有了；双目失明的生活出现在他的面前。
    李德进并没有在这种不幸面前退缩，他照常工作，参加会议，同干部一起学习。一九五四年，在经过充分学习酝酿之后，桑园村成立了第一个农业生产合作社。社员们选举李德进当社长。但由于他失去了到田野领导生产的能力，经中共区委研究，批准他担任副社长的职务。李德进对这一任务完全满意。
    在领导农业合作社的生产中，他常想怎样能像有视力的人一样看看社里的庄稼，不然光听别人说各生产小队如何肯干，自己是很难得出正确结论的。一天，他终于想到了办法。他听社员说红薯按照先进经验实行密植了，他就叫一个小女孩领着他到山上去，摸索着检查株同株之间的距离，这样来了解红薯密植程度。以后他经常到地里摸摸谷苗的稀密，苞谷苗是否出得齐，他摸着豌豆秧的高矮，就大体可以判断长得好坏。
    农业合作社成立不久，出现了窝工、旷工现象。这是当时阻碍生产的最大问题。怎样解决呢？李德进迫切想寻找一个解决的办法。他每次参加区召开的农业生产合作社社长会议的时候，都留心细听其他社解决这一问题的经验。一次他听到先锋农业生产合作社主任谈到如何实行包工的经验。他回村以后就立即访问了社内的老农民，研究哪块地一头晌能送多少粪，哪块地种什么庄稼用多少工等等，并且派了一个生产小队实地试验。最后，社委会根据土地的位置，耕作难易等条件，实行了包工制。这样，窝工、旷工的问题解决了。过去有些社员旷工、不遵守时间，现在天不亮就下地干活。过去有的社员每天挣十分，现在能挣到十二分。社员一般都能按时完成任务。
    李德进不仅工作努力，平时也十分关心群众的生活。他一直没有忘记部队首长告诉过他的话：
  “共产党员要时刻团结群众，要成为关心群众和工作的模范。”他在旧社会的遭遇，使他对劳动人民有着深厚的阶级感情，他把不关心群众疾苦看作是一种罪恶。一九五二年春节期间，村中送猪肉慰劳烈军属，他把自己的一份（他的大儿子在人民解放军）送给了一户没劳动力的贫苦军属。有一次，他知道了寡妇李陈氏没柴烧饭，就把自己家里的饭叫孩子送去。一九五四年春节以前，他到每户社员家访问春节期间有没有困难。社员李克胜缺少三元钱过春节，他把自己腰里的三元钱借给了他。正是由于李德进热爱群众，关心群众，因而在群众中享有很高的威信。有的农民家庭发生不和，或是有了其他问题，都愿意找李德进解决。一九五二年，他就调解婚姻纠纷十起。
    李德进双目失明以后，虽然仍旧积极为党工作，以保尔·柯察金和吴运铎作为自己的榜样，但他在工作中遇到的困难是很多的。一九五三年实行粮食统购统销的时候，李德进刚刚瞎了双眼，还不习惯使用引路棍。走路或外出，他时常撞头或跌倒。一天晚上，他和另一个复员建设军人冒着雨出外工作，走在路上，他一不小心倒了，把腿碰得鲜血直流。他一声没响，爬起来照常走路。那时道路很泥泞，鞋子常常被烂泥粘下，他索性把鞋脱掉，赤着脚到农民家里去宣传粮食政策。经过李德进和其他干部的宣传，农民们积极向国家卖出了自己的余粮。平时在工作中，他也能团结大家，不论什么问题都征求大家的意见。
    共产党员、革命残废军人李德进同志，就是这样克服了身体上和工作中的各种困难，和全村农民一起，为了发展生产，为了实现农业的社会主义改造而积极工作着。现在，桑园村七十三户人家，除去一户地主、一户富农和失去劳动力的孤寡之外，七十户农民都参加了农业互助合作组织。李德进同志不屈不挠为革命事业而奋斗的高尚品质照亮了这个山村。
