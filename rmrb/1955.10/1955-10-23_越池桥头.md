    Việt Trì Bridgehead
    By Zhǎn Cháo, Our Correspondent in Vietnam
    Eighty kilometers northwest of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam lies the famous Việt Trì ferry crossing. Here, the main stream of the Red River, the Chử River, merges with two other large rivers—the Black River and the Lô River—before flowing southeast, bypassing the urban area of Hanoi, and surging into the sea.
    Currently, the massive reconstruction of the Việt Trì Railway Bridge is being accelerated. This is a critical project for the full restoration of the Hanoi-Lào Cai railway line, scheduled to be completed within 1956.
    Before even reaching the riverbank, one can see from afar a tall bridge span, erected precariously between two large piers in the middle of the water, unconnected to either bank. According to the bridge engineering team's numbering, these are piers number three and four. The remaining piers, numbers one, two, and five, connecting to both banks, were destroyed during the war, and all the bridge spans had sunk into the water.
    The bridge span that we saw, seemingly erected in mid-air, was salvaged from the water by Vietnamese and Chinese workers not long ago. After being repaired and reinforced, it was then floated into position during a period of suitable high water and erected onto these two remaining piers.
    The distance from the water surface to the top of the bridge is fully twenty meters. A blower temporarily installed on the bridge frame is roaring, as workers are intensely engaged in riveting and welding. A small motorboat constantly shuttles from both sides of the river, carrying workers, technicians, or materials to this construction site on the river. Meanwhile, on both banks of the river, vigorous labor is also underway, with many workers strenuously repairing pier number one and salvaging the fourth bridge span.
    Arriving at the Việt Trì bridgehead, one is immediately and strongly drawn in by the massive scene of peaceful construction. There, one is also quickly drawn in by a resounding name. Whether it's Chinese workers, technicians, or Vietnamese workers, technicians, they frequently mention a person with respect and affection. This person recently sacrificed his young life in the high-altitude floating and erecting of the third bridge span. His name is Chen Guoping.
    Comrade Chen Guoping was a member of the Chinese Communist Party, the leader of the model team of the Chinese Bridge Engineering Team—the Second Lifting and Rigging Team—and a first-class labor model. He was thirty-one years old this year, born into a poor peasant family in Yueyang County, Hunan Province. At the age of nineteen, he began working at the Yuehan Railway Bridge Engineering Office as a worker. In the autumn of 1949, Hunan and the vast areas of the country were liberated, and the young Chen Guoping joyfully participated in the restoration and construction of the people's railway. In four years, he successively participated in the construction of more than ten bridges on the Yuehan Railway, Xianggui Railway, Longhai Railway, Jinghan Railway, and Jingshen Railway, and successively received honorary titles such as third-class advanced worker and outstanding employee awarded by the Liuzhou Railway Administration. In February 1953, Chen Guoping was also admitted as a member of the Chinese Communist Party.
    In the spring of 1955, entrusted by the people of the motherland, Chen Guoping and other comrades came to Vietnam to support the restoration and construction work of the fraternal Vietnamese people. The first task Chen Guoping and the Second Lifting and Rigging Team received in Vietnam was to repair the Phủ Lạng Thương Railway Bridge in the middle section of the Hanoi-Mục Nam Quan Railway. At that time, the time was quite tight, and there was a shortage of manpower and tools. Chen Guoping adopted methods such as rationally organizing labor and "work substitution" to improve labor efficiency and drive the work of other teams. As a result, the first phase of bridge repair was completed nine days ahead of schedule, and six hundred workdays were also saved. The Second Lifting and Rigging Team thus won the title of model team, and Chen Guoping was named a first-class labor model by the Ministry of Railways.
    Shortly after repairing the Phủ Lạng Thương and Lạng Sơn Railway Bridges, the Chinese Bridge Engineering Team accepted the task of rebuilding the Việt Trì Railway Bridge. This was a very arduous and glorious task, a key project determining whether the Hanoi-Lào Cai railway could be restored and opened to traffic as scheduled. Chen Guoping and the comrades of the Second Lifting and Rigging Team, as well as the Bridge Engineering Team, immediately plunged into intense labor as soon as they arrived at the Việt Trì ferry crossing on June 27. They cooperated with Vietnamese bridge workers and technicians to salvage, repair, and reinforce the third bridge span as quickly as possible, and made other preparations so that, during this year's flood season, they could use the high-altitude floating method to erect the bridge span on the two piers in the middle of the river. This was the central link in the reconstruction of the Việt Trì Railway Bridge. If the opportunity was missed, the entire project would have to be postponed for more than half a year, because the river would not begin to rise again until the summer of next year.
    In order to save time, Vietnamese workers, technicians, and Chinese workers, technicians, worked day and night, regardless of sunny or rainy weather. In those days, what people remember most clearly is that a tall, humble, and taciturn young man was always present whenever there were difficulties in the work. After the Second Lifting and Rigging Team under his leadership completed the pile driving task two days ahead of schedule, they immediately took the initiative to help with the work of other sections. Once, the river rose sharply, threatening to wash away more than 8,000 sleepers. This young man immediately convened a meeting of the Youth League members. He was the youth committee member of the Chinese Communist Party branch and also the secretary of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League branch. As soon as the meeting ended, he took the lead in going into the water to rescue them. As a result, not a single sleeper was lost. This young man was Comrade Chen Guoping, who was commonly loved by the Vietnamese and Chinese workers and technicians.
    By late September, everything was generally ready, but a typhoon forced the Bridge Engineering Team to postpone their work plan. According to hydrological data, the last flood of this year would be before October 5. If the floating operation could not be completed before then, they would have to wait expectantly for next year's flood season. This was very distressing. As soon as the typhoon passed, the Việt Trì ferry crossing immediately became busy. Chen Guoping braved the huge waves to lead the work of binding the steel cables. This high-altitude floating operation required a total of six main cables: two head cables pulling the two pontoons carrying the third bridge span from the front, two hawser cables fastened diagonally to both sides of the river to secure both pontoons, and two cables fastened to the downstream banks to increase the force on both sides of the two pontoons.
    By September 30, the two head cables had been completed. At this time, all that was needed was to temporarily block the upstream navigation, and the hawser cables on both sides could be bound and released. Time slowly ticked by, minute by minute. At 2:30 p.m., Comrade Nguyen Tri of the Vietnamese Bridge Engineering Team returned from upstream by motorboat and said that the river transport blockade had been completed. In an instant, Chen Guoping and the Second Lifting and Rigging Team and five Vietnamese worker comrades who were cooperating had completed all the preparations and gone down to the work boat. Chen Guoping, through translator Xiao Pei and the captain, explained the planned driving procedure: the tugboat would first retreat downstream from the embankment where the cable was tied for fifteen to twenty meters, then obliquely proceed upstream to the middle of the river and align with the embankment, and then retreat downstream from between piers number three and four to the vicinity of the pontoons carrying the third bridge span. This would reduce the traction force of the cable and the tugboat. At the same time, Chen Guoping cordially greeted the Vietnamese worker comrades and asked them to leave the bow of the boat, because he was afraid that they were not familiar and it would be easy for accidents to happen.
    At 3:05 p.m., the work boat began to travel according to the planned procedure, and everything was normal. Chen Guoping was worried that the work of tying a gasoline pontoon with a 50-meter cable was not organized properly, so he walked down from the wheelhouse to the bow of the boat to inspect. At this time, an emergency suddenly occurred. The boat was broadsided in the middle of the river, violently impacted by the river water, and the cable was tightened even more. The boat was extremely tilted. In an instant, the thick rope card on the bow of the boat broke, and the cable knocked worker Wan Zhuanyun into the water. Immediately afterwards, the winch was also broken, and worker Jiang Suichu was crushed against the gunwale by the cable. At this time, Comrade Chen Guoping rushed forward, one hand preparing to rescue Jiang Suichu, the other hand vigorously waving to let the Vietnamese workers Vu Quoc Guang and other comrades retreat to a safe place. At this moment, the cable and its mechanism knocked him into the rapids, and he was never seen again….
    After the winch was broken, the cable and the tugboat became disconnected, and the boat immediately regained its balance. At this time, worker Wan Zhuanyun had been swept away more than 200 meters away, where he was rescued by a motorboat. Worker Jiang Suichu was a good swimmer. He came up as soon as he fell into the water, clinging tightly to the side of the boat, and was rescued.
    After this unfortunate accident occurred, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the leaders of the Vietnam Workers' Party were very concerned. The Minister of Transport and Post personally went to the Việt Trì bridgehead to express condolences to the comrades of the Chinese Bridge Engineering Team. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam decided to posthumously award Comrade Chen Guoping the "Labor Medal" to commemorate the achievements of this outstanding young Chinese worker who dedicated his life to the cause of peaceful construction of the Vietnamese people.
    The Chinese and Vietnamese workers of the Việt Trì Railway Bridge vowed to use practical actions to commemorate their closest comrade-in-arms Chen Guoping. They have victoriously completed the high-altitude floating operation of the third bridge span on October 4 and are now working hard to complete the entire reconstruction project of the Việt Trì Railway Bridge on schedule or ahead of schedule.

    越池桥头
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    从越南民主共和国首都向西北行八十多公里，就到了有名的越池渡口。红河的干流滁河，在这里同其他两条大江——黑水江和泸江——汇合，然后指向东南，绕过河内市区，浩浩荡荡地奔流入海。
    现在，那里正在加紧进行着规模巨大的越池大铁桥的重建工作。这是预定在一九五六年内修复的河内—老街铁路全线关键性的工程。
    还没有到达河边，老远就可以看见一孔高大的桥梁，前不靠边、后不靠岸地架设在水中央的两个大型的桥墩上。按照桥梁工程队的编排，这是第三号和第四号桥墩。其余连接两岸的第一号、第二号和第五号桥墩，都在抗战时期被破坏了，桥梁也都全部沉到水里去了。
    我们看到的这孔仿佛是腾空架设着的桥梁，它是越南工人和中国工人不久前从水里打捞起来，经过整修和加固，然后利用适当的水位高架浮运，架设到这两个仅有的桥墩上的。
    自水面到桥顶足足有二十公尺高。一部临时安置在桥架上的鼓风机正轰响着，工人们在那里紧张地进行铆焊工作，一艘小汽船不时地从河两岸驶来，把工人、技术人员或材料载运到这个河上的工地上来。同时，在河的两岸，也展开着热烈的劳动，许多工人正在使劲地修筑第一号桥墩和打捞第四孔桥梁。
    到了越池桥头，你会立刻就被那种巨大的和平建设的场面强烈地吸引住的。在那里，你也会很快地被一个响亮的名字吸引住的。不论是中国工人、技术人员，或者是越南工人、技术人员，经常都怀着敬爱的心情提到一个人，这个人就在最近这次高架浮运第三孔桥梁的工作中献出了自己年轻的生命，他的名字叫陈国平。
    陈国平同志是中国共产党党员，中国桥梁工程队模范班——装吊第二班的班长，一等劳动模范。他今年三十一岁，出生在湖南省岳阳县一个贫农的家里，十九岁那年开始到粤汉铁路桥梁工程处当工人。一九四九年秋天，湖南和全国广大地区获得解放，年轻的陈国平欢天喜地地参加了人民铁路的恢复建设工作，四年里他先后参加了粤汉路、湘桂路、陇海路、京汉路、京沈路十多座桥梁的修建工程，先后得到柳州铁路管理局授予的三等先进工作者和优秀职工等光荣称号。一九五三年二月，陈国平并被吸收为中国共产党党员。
    一九五五年春天，接受祖国人民的委托，陈国平和其他的同志们一起来到了越南，支援兄弟的越南人民的恢复建设工作。陈国平和装吊第二班在越南领受第一个任务，就是修复河内—睦南关铁路中段的府谅商大铁桥。当时时间相当紧迫，人手和工具又很缺乏，陈国平便采取了合理地组织劳动力和“工种代替”等办法，提高了劳动效率，带动了其他班组的工作，结果提前九天完成了第一期桥梁的修复工作，并且还节省了六百个工作日。装吊第二班因此获得了模范班的称号，陈国平被铁道部评为一等劳动模范。
    修复了府谅商和谅山大铁桥后不久，中国桥梁工程队又接受了重建越池大铁桥的任务。这是一项十分艰巨而又光荣的任务，是决定河内—老街铁路能否如期修复和通车的关键工程。陈国平和装吊第二班以及桥梁工程队的同志们，六月二十七日刚一到达越池渡口，就马上投入紧张的劳动中去。他们配合越南桥梁工人和技术人员，以尽可能快的速度打捞、整修和加固第三孔桥梁，并且做好其他准备工作，以便在今年涨水季节里，用高架浮运的办法，把桥梁架设到河心里的两个桥墩上。这是重建越池大铁桥的中心环节，如果错过时机，就要使整个工程推迟半年以上，因为到明年夏天河水才开始上涨。
    为了争取时间，越南工人、技术人员和中国工人、技术人员，不分晴天雨天，不分白昼黑夜，都在突击地工作着。在这些日子里，人们记得最清楚的是，一个个子高高的、态度谦逊的、不多讲话的青年人，当哪里工作有了困难，就有他在场。他领导的装吊第二班提前两天完成了打桩任务之后，马上就主动去帮助其他工段的工作。有一次河水猛涨，眼看就要把八千多根枕木漂走，这个青年人马上召开了团员大会，他是中国共产党支部青年委员，同时也是中国新民主主义青年团支部书记，会刚开罢，他就带头下水抢救，结果一根枕木都没有遭到损失。这个青年，就是越南和中国的工人和技术人员们共同热爱的陈国平同志。
    到九月下旬，一切都大体准备就绪了，可是一阵台风刮过来，迫使桥梁工程队不得不推迟了他们的工作计划。根据水文资料，今年最后一次涨水是在十月五日以前，如果在这之前不能完成浮运工作，那只好眼巴巴地等待来年的涨水季节了。这件事是很令人焦灼的。台风一过去，越池渡口马上就忙碌起来。陈国平冒着巨大的风浪领导着捆缚钢缆的工作。这次高架浮运一共得用六根主要缆绳，这就是两根从正面牵引两只架着第三孔桥梁的浮船的迎头缆，两根缚在河两岸斜放下去以固定两只浮船两侧的八字缆，还有两根缚在下流两岸以增加两只浮船两侧力量的缆绳。
    九月三十日，两条迎头缆已经完成了。这时候，只消等到上游航运暂时封锁，就可以开始捆缚和放送两边的八字缆了。时间一分一秒地慢慢地挨过去。到下午两点半钟，越南桥梁工程队阮治同志乘着汽艇从上游回来，说是河运封锁工作已做好了。刹那间，陈国平跟装吊第二班和五位配合工作的越南工人同志已经完成了所有的准备工作，下到工作船上去了。陈国平经过翻译小裴同志和船长交代了预定计划的驾驶程序：拖轮首先从捆缚缆绳的地垅顺流后退十五到二十公尺，其次再斜斜地逆流行进到中流和地垅取齐，然后再顺流从第三号和第四号桥墩中间退到架着第三孔桥梁的浮船附近，这样可以减除缆绳和拖轮的牵引力。同时，陈国平亲切地向越南工人同志打招呼，请他们离开船头，因为怕他们不熟悉，容易发生意外。
    三时五分。工作船开始按照预定计划行驶，一切情况正常。陈国平担心按五十公尺缆绳缚一个汽油浮桶的工作组织得不够妥善，从驾驶室上走下到船头来察看。这时骤然发生紧急情况，船身在河中间打横，被河水猛烈冲击着，缆绳也愈拉紧了，船身极度倾斜。瞬息间，船头上粗大的绳卡折断了，缆绳把正站在旁边的工人万转运同志打到水里；紧接着绞车又被蹩坏了，工人蒋燧初同志被缆绳压在船弦上。这时，陈国平同志急步赶上去，一只手准备解救蒋燧初，一只手猛力挥动让越南工人武国光等同志退到安全的地方去，正在这个时候，缆绳和其机件却把他打到急流里去了，从此不见任何踪影……。
    绞车被崩坏之后，缆绳和拖轮脱离了关系，船身立即恢复了平衡。这时候，工人万转运已被冲击到二百多公尺远，在那里被汽艇救起来；工人蒋燧初水性好，刚被打落水就上来，一只手紧扒着船梆，被救起来了。
    这个不幸的事故发生后，越南民主共和国政府和越南劳动党首长们非常关心，交通和邮电部部长亲自到越池桥头慰问中国桥梁工程队的同志们，越南民主共和国政府并决定追授陈国平同志“劳动勋章”，以纪念这个为越南人民的和平建设事业献出了自己生命的中国优秀青年工人的功绩。
    越池大铁桥的中、越两国工人誓用实际行动来纪念他们最亲密的战友陈国平，他们已在十月四日胜利地完成了第三孔桥梁的高架浮运工作，现在正在为争取按期或提前完成越池大铁桥全部重建工程而努力。
