Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 5th (TASS): Indian delegation head Menon spoke on the morning of the 4th at the general political debate of the United Nations General Assembly plenary meeting. Menon said that the participants in the Geneva Four-Power Heads of Government Conference reflected the will of the people of all countries standing behind them.

Menon then spoke about the opinions of some delegations that the United Nations Charter must be revised. He said that the Indian government believes that the Charter can only be revised with unanimous consent, primarily the unanimous consent of the permanent members of the Security Council. However, now is not the appropriate time to revise the Charter. Menon also said that the Indian delegation will support any decision made on this issue with unanimous consent, but will oppose the establishment of a large, dedicated body for the purpose of revising the Charter.

Menon reminded the Assembly that one-third of all humanity is still not represented in the United Nations. He emphasized that the United Nations should not be a "closed-door club," and that the United Nations should not be a "holy alliance" of a certain group of countries. When discussing the admission of a country to the United Nations, one should not proceed from likes or dislikes of that country. Menon expressed the hope that discussions in the United Nations and the upcoming Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will reach an agreement on the issue of admitting new member states.

When talking about the economic aspects of the United Nations' work, Menon especially advocated for the establishment of a special international fund for the economic development of underdeveloped countries and called on all countries to expand economic cooperation. Menon suggested that the United Nations take the initiative in solving problems such as preventing floods. In this regard, he mentioned the successful cooperation between the Chinese and Indian governments in preventing the disaster of the Brahmaputra River floods.

When talking about the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, Menon pointed out that this conference should serve as an example of international cooperation in other areas. Menon supported the idea of establishing an international agency for the peaceful uses of atomic energy. He said that this agency should be "most closely linked to the United Nations." He said that the work of the peaceful uses of atomic energy should be organized in such a way that it does not lead to a situation in which industrialized countries exercise colonial oppression over countries that possess atomic raw materials.

Menon then spoke about disarmament. He said that various proposals have been made on this issue, and the Indian delegation sees no reason why these proposals cannot be adopted as steps towards disarmament. India will continue to insist on a complete ban on atomic weapons. The argument that such weapons can be used to "defend against aggression" does not promote universal peace.

Menon opposed the "balance of power" theory. He said that he could not understand those who think that two hydrogen bombs are safer than one hydrogen bomb. Menon said that there is only one wise decision, and that is to eliminate all bombs.

Menon expressed regret that the French delegation responded to the United Nations General Assembly's decision to discuss the Algerian issue by walking out. He hoped that France would reconsider its attitude.

Menon said that the unification of Germany cannot be achieved by only recognizing the regimes of one part or the other of Germany. The fact that the two parts exist simultaneously should be taken into account. It would be best if they could find a common language.

When talking about the Far East issue, Menon said that the Indian government "does not consider the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to be a contribution to guaranteeing peace in the region." He pointed out that to solve the Indochina issue satisfactorily, it is necessary to implement the Geneva Agreement on this issue strictly in accordance with its spirit and terms. When talking about the Korean issue, Menon advocated for negotiations to resolve the Korean issue.

He expressed the hope that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan could achieve satisfactory results.

Menon called on all countries to do their best to bring the People's Republic of China and the United States closer together. He said that some progress has been made in the relations between these two major countries. India firmly believes that the government of the People's Republic of China hopes to peacefully resolve all disputes with the United States, including the Taiwan issue. All these issues can be resolved through negotiations between the United States and the People's Republic of China.

Menon said, "We fully support the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. We advocate the path of collective peace and do not rely on military blocs." Menon finally drew the representatives' attention to the suggestions made by the Indian delegation at the last session of the General Assembly, which advocated stopping the expansion of armaments and the testing of nuclear weapons as the first steps towards reaching a disarmament agreement.

After Menon's speech, the general debate of the Assembly concluded. During the general debate, representatives from a total of forty-five countries clarified their attitudes on international issues.

After the general debate, the Assembly's committees began their work. The work of the Political Committee began on the 5th. Some committees, such as the Special Political Committee, began work on the 4th. The Special Political Committee decided to discuss the South African racial conflict issue, the Palestinian refugee issue, the situation of Indians in the Union of South Africa, and the issue of admitting new member states in turn.

    印度代表梅农在联大一般性辩论中发言
    新华社六日讯据塔斯社纽约五日讯：印度代表团团长梅农四日上午在联合国大会全体会议的一般性政治辩论中发言。梅农说，日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的参加者反映了站在他们背后的各国人民的意志。
    梅农接着谈到一些代表团认为必须修改联合国宪章的意见，他说，印度政府认为，只有在一致同意、首先是安全理事会常任理事国一致同意的情况下，才可以修改宪章。但是，现在还不是修改宪章的适当时候。梅农又说，印度代表团将支持经过一致同意而就这个问题所作出的任何决定，但是将反对为了修改宪章而设立一个专门的庞大机构。
    梅农提醒大会注意，全人类的三分之一到目前为止在联合国中还没有代表。他着重说，联合国不应是一个“关门的俱乐部”，联合国不应当是一个某一国家集团的“神圣同盟”，在讨论接纳某个国家加入联合国的时候，不能从对这个国家的好恶出发。梅农表示希望联合国中的讨论和即将举行的四国外长会议将能就接纳新会员国问题取得协议。
    梅农在谈到联合国工作的经济方面时特别主张为落后国家的经济发展设立一项专门国际基金，并且号召各国扩大经济合作。梅农建议联合国在解决像预防水灾这样一类问题方面采取主动，在这方面，他提到了中印两国政府在防止布拉马普特拉河泛滥的灾害的工作中实行成功的合作的情况。
    梅农在谈到和平利用原子能国际会议时指出，这个会议应当作为在其他方面实行国际合作的范例。梅农支持建立和平利用原子能国际机构的主张。他说，这个机构应当“最紧密地同联合国联系在一起”。他说，和平利用原子能的工作应当组织得不致使它导致让工业比较发达的国家对那些拥有原子原料的国家实行殖民压迫的局面。
    梅农接着谈到裁军问题。他说，人们对这个问题提出了各种建议，印度代表团看不出有什么理由这些建议不能被采纳为裁军的步骤。印度将继续坚持主张完全禁止原子武器。硬说可以利用这种武器来“防御侵略”的那种论据是不能促进普遍和平的。
    梅农反对那种“均势说”。他说，有人认为两个氢弹比一个氢弹更为安全，他对这种人不能理解。梅农说，明智的决定只有一个，这就是消灭一切的炸弹。
    梅农对法国代表团以退席来回答联合国大会关于讨论阿尔及利亚问题的决定表示遗憾。他希望法国重新考虑它的态度。
    梅农说，德国的统一不能用只承认德国这一部分或者是那一部分的政权的办法来实现，应该考虑到两部分同时存在这一事实。如果它们能找到共同的语言，那可能是再好不过的了。
    梅农在谈到远东问题时说，印度政府“并不认为东南亚条约组织是对保障这一地区的和平的贡献”。他指出，要圆满地解决印度支那问题，必须要确切地按照关于这一问题的日内瓦协议的精神和条款履行这个协议。梅农在谈到朝鲜问题时，主张就解决朝鲜问题进行谈判。
    他表示希望苏联同日本的谈判能够得到圆满的结果。
    梅农要求所有国家尽力促使中华人民共和国和美国接近起来。他说，在这两个大国的关系上已经取得了一些进展。印度深信，中华人民共和国政府希望同美国和平解决一切争执问题，其中包括台湾问题。所有这些问题都是可以通过美国同中华人民共和国之间的谈判来解决的。
    梅农说，我们完全支持联合国宪章的宗旨和原则。我们主张集体和平的道路，而不信赖军事集团。梅农最后提请代表们注意印度代表团在上届大会上提出的建议，这些建议中主张以停止扩充军备和停止试验核子武器作为导致达成裁军协议的第一个步骤。
    在梅农发言之后，大会的一般性辩论结束。在一般性辩论中一共有四十五个国家的代表就国际问题阐明了自己的态度。
    在一般性辩论结束后，大会各委员会即开始工作。政治委员会的工作已在五日开始。有些委员会，例如特别政治委员会在四日即已开始工作。特别政治委员会决定依次讨论南非种族冲突问题、巴勒斯坦难民问题、南非联邦印度人处境问题、接纳新会员国问题。
