    The Dynamics of All Classes in the Cooperative Movement in Qimei Township
    Xiangtan Prefectural Committee Work Group, Hunan Province
    The former Qimei Township (now mostly Qimei Township) in Jiangyu District, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, is a hilly township. The township has 401 households, 1,996 people, and more than 3,567 mu of land. This township organized mutual aid teams in the spring of 1951. Mutual aid teams have grown year by year. After the publicity of the Party's General Line during the Transition Period in 1953, the development of mutual assistance and cooperation accelerated. Now the township has 24 mutual aid teams (15 permanent teams and 9 temporary teams) with a total of 236 households, accounting for 58.85% of the total households. Last winter and this spring, Qimei, Yintang and Litang agricultural cooperatives were piloted, with a total of 54 households, accounting for 13.46% of the total agricultural households. The two cooperatives currently being established have 51 households, accounting for 12.7% of the total agricultural households. A total of 341 farm households participate in cooperative mutual aid organizations, accounting for 85% of the 401 households in the township.

    The current three agricultural cooperatives are doing well, and can all increase production. The vast majority of cooperative members can increase their income, which has initially demonstrated the superiority of collective management.

    According to this investigation, the class situation in rural areas has changed greatly since the land reform. Of the 401 households in the township, after research and analysis, 109 households are poor peasants, accounting for 27.2% of the total households in the township. The lower-middle peasants among the new middle peasants are 151 households, accounting for 37.7% of the total households. The lower-middle peasants among the old middle peasants are 20 households, accounting for 5% of the total households. The above three groups total 280 households, accounting for 69.9% of the total households in the township. The upper-middle peasants among the new middle peasants are 6 households, accounting for 1.5% of the total households. The upper-middle peasants among the old middle peasants are 88 households (including the relatively well-off and well-off old middle peasants), accounting for 21.9% of the total households. Small landowners are 2 households, small vendors are 2 households, and workers are 1 household, the three accounting for 1.24% of the total households. Rich peasants are 5 households, accounting for 1.24% of the total households. Landlords are 11 households, accounting for 2.73% of the total households. Other are 6 households, accounting for 1.5% of the total households.

    Due to the different economic ownership of each class, the attitudes towards cooperation are also different. From the perspective of each class: poor peasants, lower-middle peasants of the new middle peasants, and lower-middle peasants of the old middle peasants, their economic conditions require cooperation, so their demand for cooperation is positive and urgent. In particular, the poor peasants' demand is even more urgent. Among the 109 poor peasant households in this township, 78 are active, accounting for 71.6% of the poor peasant households (including 21 households that have joined the cooperative). After the land reform, although they were allocated land, they were still in a state of poverty due to their weak foundation and lack of means of production, and could not withstand natural disasters. Therefore, their demand for cooperation is very urgent. Liu Yunsheng (now a poor peasant) has a family of seven. Before liberation, his grandfather, father, and himself had to beg for food. At the age of twelve, he looked after cattle and worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord. During the land reform, he was allocated 9.5 mu of land and 2 houses, but due to his weak foundation, lack of means of production, and inability to invest, he still needed to borrow money to maintain production and endure the exploitation of paying three dou of interest for every dan of grain borrowed. In 1951, he borrowed 15 dan of grain and sold two dan of new grain to buy lime (selling new grain is similar to selling green seedlings, and farmers only sell new grain when they have no other choice; each shi of current grain can buy 11 dan of lime, while new grain can only buy 6 dan). After paying off the debt in autumn, there was little left. In 1952, he sold 15 dan of new grain and borrowed 10 dan of grain (with an interest of 3 dou per dan) to buy two dan of new grain of lime. In this way, in 1953, it became even more difficult, selling 20 dan of new grain and borrowing 10 dan of grain. After the autumn harvest, he paid 36 dan of current grain. After planting the rice, there was no food to eat. His mother and wife were so anxious that tears flowed down their faces, and the seven members of the family were about to run out of rice and money. At this time, the General Line began to be implemented in rural areas, and the unified purchase and sale of grain was implemented. He actively participated in the unified purchase and sale movement and obtained loans from banks and credit cooperatives, which solved the difficulties in production and life. His life was still difficult in 1954. Liu Yunsheng's request to join the cooperative is the most urgent. He said: "In the past three years, capitalist exploitation has taken away more than 40 dan of grain from me. Our family of seven can't eat all of this grain in a year. Capitalist exploitation makes me hungry and have no food to eat. I will not be reconciled even if I die if I don't eliminate capitalism. I am determined to take the socialist road and must participate in the agricultural cooperative." He actively led the mutual aid team, improved the system, created conditions, and strived to transfer to the cooperative. Since the summer, he has submitted reports six times applying for transfer to the cooperative, and asked the staff whenever he saw them: When will our team be approved to transfer to the cooperative? He also personally went to the district head four times and said to the district head: "The cooperative will be built one day earlier, and there will be one day of benefits. You can't count our shortcomings, and you don't approve it. If the staff is not free, we will build it ourselves, and we guarantee not to mess it up." At the joint meeting of mutual aid team leaders, he also said: "If there are any shortcomings in our team, please point them out so that we can correct them and transfer to the cooperative." He also took the initiative to find the staff in charge of building the cooperative and the militia company commander to lead a meeting in his team. Huang Jinsheng, the leader of the mutual aid team (a poor peasant), applied to the head of the Yintang Agricultural Cooperative six times to join the cooperative, and mobilized all nine poor peasant households in the team to collectively submit a report requesting to join the Yintang Cooperative. Not only do poor peasants actively demand to join the cooperative, but after joining the cooperative, they also actively fight for the consolidation of the cooperative. Tan Fengyi, a poor peasant (head of the Yintang Cooperative), has always resolutely implemented the Party's policies. When the cooperative was being built, Song Youde, a new upper-middle peasant, and Huang Nansheng, a wealthy middle peasant, refused to allow the poor peasants Zhang Zhulin and Wu Hanming to join the cooperative. Tan Fengyi strictly criticized this act of excluding poor peasants and said: "The purpose of building the cooperative is for everyone to become rich. What socialism can be achieved without poor peasants? We can't do without them." After the cooperative was built, he has always paid attention to relying on poor peasants politically and helping them overcome difficulties economically. He often had individual talks with poor peasants such as Wu Hanming to improve their awareness. In June, when poor peasants Zhang Zhulin, Chen Fuhua, etc. had no money to buy rice, he took the initiative to lend 40 yuan to six poor peasant households through the cooperative committee. Song Zonghan, a new upper-middle peasant, also took the opportunity to borrow money from the cooperative to make clothes. The cooperative committee refused, so he threatened the head of the cooperative and said: "My family works a lot and invests a lot (actually not much), and I can't get money, but they (referring to the poor peasants) invest less and borrow more money. Why is this?" Tan Fengyi patiently explained to him: "They (referring to the poor peasants) have difficulties in production and life, and helping them overcome difficulties is also to improve production in the cooperative. Their investment is not small. The loans from the government and credit cooperatives are not lent to everyone in the cooperative, but to support the production of farmers in difficulty. Without them, the cooperative would not be able to be built at all." Although his own family members were sick and life was difficult, he still wholeheartedly ran the cooperative, relying on the poor peasants to constantly fight against capitalist ideas in the cooperative in various issues. Therefore, this cooperative is doing well, production can be greatly increased, and members can increase their income. The surrounding farmers are clamoring to join this cooperative, and currently 25 households have been linked to the cooperative. After joining the cooperative, Wu Hanming, a poor peasant, actively produced. He was ill for three or four consecutive months. As soon as he recovered, he actively went to work, planting rice early and late, transporting manure more, and taking the lead in collecting grain in the valley floor on rainy days. Seeing the yellowed crops falling on the roadside, he automatically tied them up and straightened them. All of the above examples can show that poor peasants are active and determined to participate in agricultural cooperatives. The 27 poor peasant households who are not very active in cooperation account for 24.8% of the poor peasants, and they will soon take active action after mobilization. Only four households, accounting for 3.6% of the poor peasants, expressed their unwillingness to join the cooperative now. Among them, three households are orphans and widows with support, and one household is passive because they are being ostracized (this household will become active).

    The lower-middle peasants among the new middle peasants and the lower-middle peasants among the old middle peasants, although they are economically better than the poor peasants, they are not yet wealthy, their economic status is very unstable, and they still have many difficulties. Therefore, their demand for cooperation is urgent and active. For example, Wu Haizhi (a new lower-middle peasant), who is 58 years old, often went to participate in meetings when the Yintang Cooperative was built last year. He also led the mutual aid team to spontaneously transfer to the cooperative. After being dissuaded, he still actively led the mutual aid team to do a good job in production and prepare to transfer to the cooperative. District Chief Tang probed him: "You are so old, why are you still engaging in cooperative?" He said: "Although I am old and can't live a good life for a few years, I will do my best to run the cooperative well, and my descendants will also say that I have done a great thing for them." Some of these two types of people still have doubts and worries on some issues due to insufficient understanding of the cooperative policy. However, as long as they are educated and mobilized, they will take active action and participate in the cooperative movement. As for those who are not active now, they only account for a small number.

    The upper-middle peasants among the old middle peasants and the upper-middle peasants among the new middle peasants, currently there are eight households who actively request to join the cooperative, accounting for 8.5% of the total number of households in these two groups. However, from the perspective of the entire class, the new and old upper-middle peasants, due to their good economic conditions and affluent lives, are growing capitalist ideas to varying degrees, and are generally wavering, watching, and waiting for cooperation. Some show passivity, and even have resistance. For example, Xu Dehe, a new upper-middle peasant, now has complete cattle and farm implements, and lives a prosperous life. He takes a passive attitude towards cooperation. Last year, when he was the leader of the mutual aid team, he often went out to engage in sideline businesses to earn cash. His fields were mainly planted by team members, and he paid the team members' wages at a low price. When the mutual aid team he was in transferred to the cooperative, he withdrew from the team and found six other individual farmers to organize a temporary mutual aid team, acting as the leader himself. He only held three meetings in half a year and collective labor twice. The mutual aid team is actually his object of exploitation. When the cooperative began to be built this year, he still refused to join the cooperative after repeated mobilization by activists. Not only are these people unwilling to join the cooperative now, but even if they do join the cooperative, they often express dissatisfaction with the cooperative. Huang Guisheng, an old upper-middle peasant (who has joined the Qimei Cooperative), was wrongly classified as a rich peasant during the land reform. When the class policy was promoted during the cooperative building last winter, he mistakenly thought that the class would be reclassified, fearing that he would be classified as a rich peasant again, so he reluctantly joined the cooperative. After joining the cooperative, he was dissatisfied with the cooperative and resisted when dealing with issues related to him, often saying that he wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. The cooperative decided to use his eight fen of land that he had invested in as a seedling field, so he planted spring cabbage in the field. The cooperative committee held a meeting to study this issue and called him several times, but he did not come to participate. When the staff of the cooperative consulted with him, he said: "If you want to use my field as a seedling field, I will withdraw from the cooperative." It turned out that the cooperative stipulated that the spring harvest crops would be "whoever plants them, whoever harvests them." He wanted to take advantage of this loophole and plant a season of spring cabbage and harvest it himself. After much persuasion, he reluctantly agreed. When planting rice seedlings, he had just sold pigs and had 80 yuan at home, but he still wanted to borrow money from the cooperative to buy meat. The cooperative committee did not agree, so he spread dissatisfaction among the cooperative members, saying "How can there be such a thing as planting rice seedlings without eating meat?" While planting rice seedlings, he incited the cooperative members who were planting rice seedlings in front of the cooperative committee and said: "Is there any meat to eat? If there is no meat to eat, go ashore." Under his incitement, the cooperative members dropped the seedlings and prepared to go ashore. They only started working again after the cooperative committee persuaded them. After joining the cooperative, he did not invest a single penny. Song Youde, a new upper-middle peasant, is a member of the Yintang Cooperative. In 1953, he bought 40 shi of new grain and engaged in other minor forms of exploitation. His family has a total of 19 people, 24 mu of land, complete cattle and farm implements, and strong labor force, and lives a very prosperous life. When the cooperative began to be built this spring, he was afraid of suffering losses and did not want the poor peasants Zhang Zhulin and Chen Fuhua to join the cooperative. He only reluctantly agreed after explanation and mobilization. When mobilizing investment, his family had a pile of burnt bricks and wanted to value them at a high price of 30 yuan to invest in the cooperative (actually only worth 15 yuan), otherwise he would not join the cooperative. He only reluctantly accepted after valuing them at 20 yuan. After planting rice seedlings, he rarely invested in the cooperative.

    Currently, the climax of the cooperative movement in Qimei Township has arrived. Most of the poor peasant class has taken active action. They are actively carrying out liaison, driving the broad masses of farmers into the new socialist revolutionary movement. Currently, the farmers who actively participate in agricultural cooperatives in the township have reached 45.66% of the total households. The investigation materials prove that the poor peasant class's demand for the cooperative movement is the most urgent and the most active. After joining the cooperative, they are also determined to run the cooperative well. Therefore, in the cooperative movement, we must firmly rely on the poor peasants (including the new and old lower-middle peasants). Only by relying on the poor peasants can we better unite the middle peasants and fight against the rich peasants. Only in this way can the cooperative movement develop healthily. From the investigation materials, the poor peasants and the new and old lower-middle peasants account for 69.9% of the total number of households in rural areas. Among them, those who have taken active action account for 60.4%, and another 30.4% of the people will soon take active action. This means that the climax of cooperation has a broad mass base. The upper-middle peasants among the new middle peasants and the upper-middle peasants among the old middle peasants, some of them are currently willing to join the cooperative, and the rest of them are largely unwilling to join the cooperative. However, if we can rely on the poor peasants, actively run the agricultural cooperatives well, and strengthen socialist education for them, they will also become aware and demand to join the cooperative after a certain period of time. Therefore, in the movement, we should not force them to join the cooperative, but we should unite them well to move forward together.

    The rural Party branch is the direct organizer and leader in the cooperative movement. Only by relying on the branch and giving play to the organizational strength of the branch can we adapt to the development of the new situation. The investigation materials prove that the branch's leadership ability in running the cooperative has been greatly improved. Among the seven Party members in this township, only one is a formal Party member, but under the leadership of the Party, they study hard, work actively, and run the existing three cooperatives very well. Tan Fengyi, the head of the Yintang Cooperative, is a Party member. He works hard with all the cooperative members to produce and constantly educates the cooperative members, which has improved the socialist consciousness of the cooperative members. We must pay great attention to strengthening the leadership of the branch so that the branch's leadership ability can be continuously improved in the movement. In the future, the branch must run the old cooperatives well to drive the new cooperatives, actively cultivate objects for transferring to the cooperative, and conscientiously implement the Party's class policy in rural areas in all its work. Only in this way can we adapt to the new situation and lead the cooperative movement well.

    棋梅乡合作化运动中各阶层的动态
    中共湖南省湘潭地委工作组
    湖南省湘潭县姜畬区原棋梅乡（现棋梅乡的一大部）是一个丘陵乡。全乡四百零一户，一千九百九十六人，三千五百六十七亩多田。这个乡一九五一年春就组织了互助组。互助组逐年都有发展。一九五三年宣传了党在过渡时期的总路线以后，互助合作的发展更加迅速。现在全乡有互助组二十四个（常年组十五个，临时组九个），共二百三十六户，占总户数百分之五十八点八五；去冬今春试办了棋梅、银塘、犁塘三个农业合作社，共五十四户，占总农户百分之十三点四六；现在还正在建立的两个社有五十一户，占总农户百分之十二点七。参加合作互助组织的农户共三百四十一户，占全乡四百零一户的百分之八十五。
    现在的三个农业合作社办得不坏，都可以增加生产，绝大部分社员可以增加收入，已初步显示了集体经营的优越性。
    据这次调查了解，土地改革以后，农村阶级情况起了很大变化。全乡四百零一户，经研究分析，贫农一百零九户，占全乡总户数的百分之二十七点二；新中农中的下中农一百五十一户，占总户数的百分之三十七点七；老中农中的下中农二十户，占总户数的百分之五。以上三部分人共二百八十户，占全乡总户数的百分之六十九点九。新中农中的上中农六户，占全乡总户数的百分之一点五；老中农中的上中农八十八户（包括比较富裕的和富裕的老中农），占总户数的百分之二十一点九。小土地出租者二户，小贩二户，工人一户，三者占总户数的百分之一点二四。富农五户，占总户数的百分之一点二四。地主十一户，占总户数的百分之二点七三。其他六户，占总户数百分之一点五。
    由于各阶层的经济占有情况不同，对合作化的态度也有所不同。从各阶层来看：贫农和新中农中的下中农、老中农中的下中农，他们经济条件需要合作化，因此对合作化的要求是积极的迫切的。特别是贫农要求更为迫切。这个乡贫农一百零九户，其中积极的有七十八户，占贫农户数的百分之七十一点六（已入社的二十一户在内）。他们在土地改革以后，虽然分得了土地，但因底子薄，缺乏生产资料，经不起自然灾害的袭击，经济情况仍处于贫困的状态，因此，对合作化要求很迫切。刘云生（现贫农）全家七人。解放前祖父、父亲、自己都要过饭。他十二岁就给地主看牛、做长工。土地改革时分得九亩五分田、房子二间，但由于底子薄，缺乏生产资料，无力投资，仍需要借债来维持生产，忍受担谷三斗息的剥削。一九五一年借谷十五担，卖了两担新谷买石灰（卖新谷类似卖青苗，农民在万不得已的情况下才卖新谷；每石现谷可买石灰十一担，新谷只能买六担），秋收还账后，所剩无几。一九五二年出卖新谷十五担，借谷十担（每担息三斗），买了两担新谷的石灰。这样，一九五三年更加困难，卖出新谷二十担，借谷十担，秋收后付出现谷三十六担。扮禾后，就没有饭吃，母亲、妻子急得眼泪双流，七口人眼看无米无钱。这时农村开始贯彻总路线，实行粮食统购统销，他积极参加了统购统销运动，得到银行、信用合作社贷款，解决了生产、生活上的困难问题。一九五四年他生活仍然有困难。刘云生要求入社是最迫切的，他说：“三年来资本主义剥削去我四十多担谷子。这些谷子我们七口人一年也吃不完。资本主义剥削使我饿肚，没饭吃，不消灭资本主义，我死也不甘心。我坚决走社会主义道路，一定参加农业合作社。”他积极领导互助组，改进制度，创造条件，争取转社。自夏季以来，先后六次打报告申请转社，见了工作人员就问：什么时候批准我们组转社？还亲自四次找区长，对区长说：“社早建一天，有一天好处。你数不出我们的缺点，又不批准；如果工作人员不得闲，我们自己建，保证不搞坏。”在互助组长联席会上，他也说：“我们组内有什么缺点，请大家提出来，我们纠正了好转社。”并主动找建社工作人员和民兵中队长到他组去领导开会。互助组长黄金生（贫农）六次向银塘农业合作社长申请入社，并发动了全组九户贫农，集体打报告要求加入银塘社。贫农不但积极要求入社，他们在入了社以后，还积极地为社的巩固而斗争。贫农谭逢怡（银塘社社长），一向坚决地贯彻党的政策。在建社时，新上中农宋友德、富裕中农黄南生拒绝贫农张竹林、伍汉明入社，谭逢怡严格地指责了这种排斥贫农的行为说：“办社是为了大家富裕，不要贫农搞得起什么社会主义，不要他们不行。”社建成以后，他一直注意在政治上依靠贫农，在经济上帮助他们克服困难。经常同贫农伍汉明等个别谈话，提高他们的觉悟。六月间贫农张竹林、陈福华等无钱买米，他主动通过社委借给六户贫农四十块钱。新上中农宋宗汉也趁机要向社借钱做衣服，社委不肯，他就要挟社长说：“我家出工多，投资不少（实际不多），还不能支钱，他们（指贫农）投资少、借钱多，这是为什么？”谭逢怡耐心地向他解释说：“他们（指贫农）生产生活有困难，帮助他们克服困难，也是为了搞好社内生产。他们投资并不少，政府和信用社的贷款，不是贷给社内所有的人的，而是扶持困难农民生产的，没有他们社就根本搞不成。”他自己虽然家里病了人，生活困难，还是一心一意地办社，在各项问题上，依靠了贫农不断地向社内资本主义思想作斗争，所以这个社办得较好，生产可以大大增加，社员都能增加收入。周围农民纷纷要求参加这个社，目前已有二十五户在社里挂了钩。贫农伍汉明入社后积极生产。他三、四两个月连续害病，病刚好就积极出工，插田起早搭晚，运粪多装，下雨天到谷坪里收谷他当先，看见黄了的庄稼倒在路旁，他自动去扎好扶正。以上这些实例都可以说明贫农参加农业合作社是积极的、坚决的。贫农对合作化还不十分积极的二十七户，占贫农的百分之二十四点八，经过动员很快就会积极行动起来。只有四户，占贫农百分之三点六，表示现在不愿入社，其中三户是孤寡有依靠，一户因被排挤表现消极（这一户是会积极起来的）。
    新中农中的下中农和老中农中的下中农，他们虽然在经济上比贫农好一些，但他们还不富裕，经济地位很不巩固，还有不少困难。因此，他们对合作化的要求，是迫切的、积极的。如伍海芝（新下中农），年已五十八岁，去年银塘社建社时，他经常去参加会；并领导互助组自发转社，经劝阻以后，他仍然积极领导互助组搞好生产，准备转社。唐区长试探他：“你这样大年纪还搞么子社？”他说：“我虽然老了，过不了几年好日子，但是我尽力把社搞好了，子孙后代也说我为他们办了一件大好事。”这两种人中有一部分人由于对合作化的政策不够了解，在某些问题上还有怀疑顾虑，但只要经过宣传教育，串连发动，就会积极行动起来，参加合作化运动。至于现在不积极的只占少数。
    老中农中的上中农和新中农中的上中农，现在积极要求入社的有八户，占这两部分人总户数的百分之八点五。但就整个阶层来看，新、老上中农由于经济条件好，生活富裕，程度不同地滋长着资本主义思想，对合作化一般的是动摇观望、等待，有些表现消极，甚至有抵触情绪。如新上中农许德和，现在耕牛农具齐全，生活富裕，对合作化采取消极态度。去年他担任互助组长时，经常出外搞副业赚现钱；他的田主要由组员代种，用低价付还组员工资。他所在的那个互助组转社时他退了组，又另外找了六户单干农民组织一个临时互助组，自任组长，半年只开三次会，集体劳动二次。互助组实际上是他的剥削对象。今年开始建社时，经过积极分子再三发动，他仍拒绝入社。这类人不但现在不愿入社，即使入了社也经常表现对社不满。老上中农黄桂生（已参加棋梅社），土地改革时划阶级被错划为富农，去冬建社时宣传阶级政策，他误认为要再划阶级，怕又被划为富农，勉强入了社；入社后对社不满，处理同他有关的问题就有抵触，经常说要退社。社里决定把他入社的八分田做秧田，他就在田里种上春白菜。社委开会研究这一问题，叫他数次，他不来参加。社的工作人员同他商议时他说：“要把我的田作秧田，我就退社吧。”原来社里规定春收作物“谁种谁收”，他想钻这个空子，自己栽上一季春白菜自己收。经过多方动员，他才勉强同意了。插秧时他刚卖了猪，家里放着八十块钱，还要向社里借钱买肉吃；社委没有答应，他就在社员中散布不满情绪，说“插秧不吃肉，哪有这样事”。正在插秧时，又当着社委煽动插秧的社员说：“有没有肉吃？没有肉吃就上岸。”在他的煽动下，社员丢开秧准备上岸，经过社委说服才又工作起来。他入社后，没有投资一文现钱。新上中农宋友德是银塘社社员。一九五三年买新谷四十石，还有其他轻微剥削。他家共十九口人，二十四亩田，耕牛农具齐全，劳力又多又强，生活很富裕。今春开始建社时，怕吃亏不愿意贫农张竹林、陈福华参加社，后经解释动员才勉强同意。在发动投资时，他家有陈砖一堆要以高价三十元作价入社（实际只值十五元），否则不入社，后作价二十元才勉强接受。插秧以后，他很少向社投资。
    目前棋梅乡合作化运动的高潮已经到来，贫农阶层大部分积极行动起来了，他们积极地进行串连，带动广大农民群众卷入了新的社会主义革命运动。现在全乡积极参加农业合作社的农户已达总户数的百分之四十五点六六。调查材料证明，贫农阶层对合作化运动要求是最迫切、最积极的。他们入社以后，也是坚决要把社办好的。所以，在合作化运动中，我们必须坚决依靠贫农（包括新、老下中农）；也只有依靠贫农，才能更好地团结中农，才能对富农进行斗争，合作化运动才能健康地向前发展。从调查材料来看，贫农和新、老下中农占农村总户数的百分之六十九点九。他们中间已积极行动起来的占百分之六十点四，另外百分之三十点四的人也即将积极行动起来。这就是说，合作化的高潮是有广泛的群众基础的。新中农中的上中农和老中农中的上中农，他们中间目前有一些人是自愿入社的，其余的很大一部分还是不愿意入社。但是，如果我们能依靠贫农，积极把农业合作社办好，并对他们加强社会主义教育，在一定时期以后，他们也是会觉悟起来，要求入社的。所以，在运动当中，不应勉强他们入社，但应当很好地团结他们一同前进。
    农村党支部在合作化运动中是直接的组织者和领导者。只有依靠支部，发挥支部的组织力量，才能适应新形势的发展。调查材料证明，支部在办社中领导能力已有很大的提高。这个乡七个党员中只有一个正式党员，但他们在党的领导下努力学习，积极工作，把现有三个社办得很好。银塘社社长谭逢怡是个党员。他和全体社员一起努力生产，经常教育社员，提高了社员的社会主义觉悟。我们必须十分注意加强对支部的领导，使支部的领导能力在运动中不断提高。今后支部必须办好老社以带动新社，积极培养转社对象，并且在各项工作中，认真地贯彻党在农村的阶级政策。这样才能适应新的形势，领导好合作化运动。
