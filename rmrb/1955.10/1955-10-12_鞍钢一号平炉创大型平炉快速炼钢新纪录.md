Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 11th -- After learning the advanced steelmaking experience of Kolesnikov, an outstanding Soviet steelworker, the No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant set a new record for rapid steelmaking in large open hearth furnaces throughout the plant on the 9th. The steelmaking time was shortened by three hours and ten minutes compared to the planned time per furnace, and by two hours and ten minutes compared to the rapid steelmaking standard time. The quality of the steel was good.

The day before setting the new record, Kolesnikov, a member of the Soviet youth delegation invited to China to participate in the National Conference of Activists in Socialist Construction, and who had been awarded the title of "Nation's Best Steelworker," arrived at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Plant. He and the steelworkers of Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace jointly produced a furnace of steel. The steelworkers operating this open hearth furnace comprehensively summarized Kolesnikov's advanced steelmaking experience and immediately applied his advanced methods of controlling furnace temperature, slag, and heating bulk raw materials and cold materials during the steelmaking process, resulting in the new record for rapid steelmaking in large open hearth furnaces.

    鞍钢一号平炉创大型平炉快速炼钢新纪录
    新华社鞍山十一日电　鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂一号平炉学习了苏联优秀炼钢工人科列斯尼科夫的先进炼钢经验后，在九日创造了全厂大型平炉快速炼钢的新纪录。炼钢时间比规定的每炼一炉钢的计划时间缩短了三小时零十分钟，比快速炼钢标准时间缩短了两小时零十分钟。钢的质量良好。
    创造新纪录的前一天，应邀来我国参加全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的苏联青年代表团的团员、曾经荣获“国家最好的钢铁工人”称号的科列斯尼科夫到了鞍钢炼钢厂。他和鞍钢一号平炉的炼钢工人共同炼了一炉钢。操纵这座平炉的炼钢工人们全面地总结了科列斯尼科夫的先进炼钢经验，并立刻在炼钢过程中运用了他的控制炉温、熔渣和对散状原料、冷料加热的先进方法，结果创造了这次大型平炉快速炼钢的新纪录。
