Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 1st: The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed on September 29th the Soviet delegation's proposal to include the issue of "Measures for Further Easing International Tension and Developing International Cooperation" on the agenda of the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

    Soviet representative Kuznetsov made a speech, requesting that the proposal be included on the agenda.

    US representative Lodge agreed to include the Soviet-proposed item on the agenda. He said that the United States did not object to the great significance of the Geneva Conference of the Four Great Powers and the Bandung Asian-African Conference mentioned in the Soviet proposal, nor did it object to calling on governments of all countries to continue their efforts to further ease international tension in order to strengthen world peace and security.

    The General Committee unanimously recommended that the General Assembly include the item proposed by the Soviet delegation on the agenda and refer it to the First Committee (Political and Security Committee) for discussion.

    The General Committee also discussed the issue of including the West Irian issue on the agenda. Representatives from Indonesia, India, the Netherlands, and Australia participated in the discussion of this issue at their own request, even though they were not members of the General Committee.

    Indonesian representative Soegawijo insisted that the West Irian issue should be included on the agenda. He pointed out that this time the item was not only proposed by Indonesia but also by another fourteen Asian and African countries.

    Soegawijo also recalled that the Bandung Conference, representing half of the world's population, unanimously declared its support for a solution to this issue that takes into account the interests of the Indonesian people.

    This motion was supported by representatives from India, Thailand, Egypt, the Soviet Union, Haiti, and Poland, and opposed by representatives from the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia, and France.

    The General Committee decided by a vote of seven to five to include the West Irian issue on the General Assembly agenda.
