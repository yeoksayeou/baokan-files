The workers constructing the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway are working hard to complete the task of laying tracks 108 kilometers westward from Zhangye, which the state has recently added. Currently, the bridge and culvert subgrade earthwork for these 108 kilometers has fully commenced. The stones needed for the 11-kilometer-long lake beach area are being transported westward around the clock from Dongle, east of Zhangye, by trucks and other transportation means. The filling project for the largest lake beach in the lake beach area—Maojia Lake Beach—is also nearing completion. Most of the sixteen medium and small bridge projects are under construction, and the fastest progress has been made on the Heihe River Bridge, where the first and second piers of the east abutment have been completed. Thousands of young and middle-aged laborers from Wuwei, Jiuquan, and Linze are carrying out subgrade earthwork in sections.

To ensure the progress of the project, a prefabrication plant and a rail spiking plant have been built in Linze and will soon be put into production to supply the required prefabricated concrete bridge and culvert components and prefabricated rail sections. Track laying will begin westward from Zhangye in early November. (Our correspondent in Lanzhou)

    兰新铁路追加工程开始修建
    修建兰新铁路的职工，正以紧张的劳动完成着国家新近追加的从张掖向西铺轨一百零八公里的任务。现在，这一百零八公里的桥涵路基土方工程已经全面开工。十一公里长的湖滩地带所需要的石块，正由汽车和其他运输工具从张掖以东的东乐日夜不停的向西赶运。湖滩地带最大的湖滩——毛家湖滩，填方工程也已经接近完成。十六座中、小桥梁工程大部分都在修建，进展最快的黑河大桥，东台第一、二号桥墩已经完工。来自武威、酒泉和临泽等地的几千个青壮年民工，分段进行着路基土方工程。
    为了保证工程进度，成品厂、钉道厂已在临泽修建厂房，不久就要投入生产，供应这里所需要的桥涵混凝土成品和轨节成品。十一月上旬，从张掖向西就要开始铺轨了。　（本报驻兰州记者）
