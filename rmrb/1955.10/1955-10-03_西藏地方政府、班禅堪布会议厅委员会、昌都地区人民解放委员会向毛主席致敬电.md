To Chairman Mao:

    On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the major cities and towns of Lhasa, Xigaze, and Qamdo in Tibet, along with the monks, laypeople, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, and working personnel, are celebrating with boundless joy. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, our great motherland, after winning the victory of the people's democratic revolution, has achieved brilliant successes in socialist construction over the past six years. The production and lives of the people of all brotherly ethnic groups across the country are showing a thriving new atmosphere. Under the shining light of the general task of the motherland's transition period, the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of our country, adopted by the Second Session of the First National People's Congress, inspires the enthusiasm of all brotherly ethnic groups and our Tibetan people to build the motherland.
    Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central Government and the correct implementation of the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policies by the working personnel and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, the Tibetan and brotherly ethnic groups, especially the Han nationality, and within Tibet itself, have achieved unprecedented unity, which is continuing to be strengthened and consolidated. Tibet's politics, economy, and culture are also developing day by day. Based on national unity, internal unity in Tibet, and achievements in various tasks, the seventh plenary meeting of the State Council adopted the "Decision on the Establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region" and other decisions to assist in the construction of Tibet. This is entirely in line with the present and future interests of the Tibetan people. In order to implement the State Council's decision, we have jointly united and worked hard to establish the Preparatory Office for the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Under the leadership of the Central Government and the direct guidance of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, we have begun the preparatory work for the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Therefore, we are even more joyful this year as we celebrate National Day. In the future, we must further strengthen the unity with all brotherly ethnic groups, strengthen internal unity in Tibet, sincerely love the great motherland, and carry out the socialist construction of the motherland together with all brotherly ethnic groups. We will strive to realize the State Council's various decisions on Tibetan work and to build a happy new Tibet.

    在中华人民共和国成立六周年的纪念日，西藏拉萨、日喀则、昌都各大城镇以及各地僧俗人民，和进藏人民解放军、工作人员一起，以无限欢欣的心情进行庆祝。我们伟大的祖国在中国共产党和你的领导下，在赢得了人民民主革命胜利之后，六年来，在社会主义建设方面又取得了光辉成就，全国各兄弟民族人民的生产、生活各方面都呈现着欣欣向荣的新气象。在祖国过渡时期的总任务的光辉照耀下，第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过的我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，鼓舞着各兄弟民族和我们藏族人民的建设祖国的热情。
    西藏地方自和平解放以来，由于中央的正确领导，由于进藏工作人员和人民解放军正确执行了中国共产党的民族政策，藏族和兄弟民族，特别是和汉族以及西藏内部都达到了空前的团结，这种团结还在继续不断地加强和巩固。西藏的政治、经济、文化也一天天向前发展着。在民族团结和西藏内部团结以及各项工作成就的基础上，国务院全体会议第七次会议通过了关于成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定以及帮助西藏建设等决定。这是完全符合西藏人民现在和将来的利益的。为执行国务院决定，我们共同团结、努力地成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会筹备处，在中央领导下，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和中共西藏工委直接指导下，开始了西藏自治区筹备委员会的筹备工作。因此我们今年在庆祝国庆节之际更加欢乐。今后我们要更加加强和各兄弟民族的团结，加强西藏内部的团结，真诚地热爱伟大的祖国，和各兄弟民族一道进行祖国社会主义建设。为实现国务院关于西藏工作的各项决定，为建设幸福的新西藏而努力。
