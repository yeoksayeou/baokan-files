    Strictly conserving all kinds of metal is an important aspect of practicing economy in units that produce and use metal. Since the Central Committee issued the call for overall conservation, many departments and enterprises have begun to pay attention to this work. In the design of construction projects, attention has been paid to replacing steel structures with reinforced concrete structures. In industrial production, attention has been paid to reducing the amount of steel used and replacing precious metals with other materials; some factories have even launched "no raw material requisition production day" campaigns using the materials saved. The most influential and widely supported by the masses is the youth conservation team activities currently being carried out in various places. They carry out voluntary labor in their spare time, cleaning up accumulated materials, picking up discarded old materials, and recovering and utilizing tens of thousands of tons of various metals. These have produced significant economic results and have initially established an atmosphere of valuing metal conservation.
    However, the achievements made so far are far from meeting the requirements for strict metal conservation. Metal conservation must be a nationwide effort, but until now, not every leading worker in every enterprise, every employee, and all the people have understood the significance of metal conservation. In order to eliminate the phenomenon of wasting metal, there is a need for extensive publicity and organizational work, but we have not done enough in these areas. There are also various ways to conserve metal. In order to make metal conservation work effective, it is also necessary to start from all aspects and take various specific measures. However, this aspect of the work is still very weak.
    In some places, more metal is used than should be. For example, the safety factor of building structures is too large. Some factory buildings could have used reinforced concrete structures but instead used steel structures. Some civil buildings could have used brick and wood structures but instead used reinforced concrete structures. The yield rate of metal casting is too low, and the machining allowance left when machining parts in the machine processing industry is too large. In addition, the phenomenon of using large materials for small purposes and long materials for short purposes is also very common. In 1954 alone, the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company lost more than 2,700 tons of steel due to the two reasons of using large materials for small purposes and excessively high loss rates. In the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry system, the metal utilization rate for manufacturing machine tools and power machinery in 1954 was only 45 to 55 percent, and nearly half of the metal materials became chips. These wastes must obviously be overcome.
    In some places, metal is used extensively even when it should not be; or precious materials are used when ordinary metal materials should be used. For example, doors, windows, railings, fences, and daily-use chairs, pot racks, cabinets, etc. in general buildings could be made of other materials but are made of metal materials; glass can be used to make canned food boxes, but expensive imported tinplate is used; many products can use plastic but metal is used extensively. Also, door and window bolts and hinges could be made of iron but are made of copper; certain machine parts can be made of carbon steel but are made of high-quality steel, or can be made of cast iron but are made of copper. Obviously, there are still many areas where savings should be made in these aspects.
    In addition, the waste caused by irresponsibility and poor management is also very alarming. Since the Anshan Steel Plant started operation after liberation, a large amount of molten steel has often been carried out when pouring steel slag, and it is estimated that more than 97,000 tons of good steel have been discarded successively. In the factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, due to the high scrap rate of castings, 30,000 tons of castings were scrapped in 1954 alone, worth 20 million yuan. These are relatively prominent examples. In terms of management, although there are many saving methods currently adopted by enterprises, they are not strict enough.
    Therefore, enterprises must never be satisfied with the achievements they have already made in metal conservation, and must further strengthen their work and plug the loopholes in waste in all aspects. It must be recognized that metal conservation is an important part of the overall conservation work and an important technical policy in the socialist construction cause. If all units that produce and use metal can find ways to eliminate various phenomena of wasting metal, they can save a lot of funds for the country and promote the speed of socialist construction. Therefore, metal conservation is not only an economic issue, but also a political issue.
    Design workers bear a great responsibility in metal conservation work. Design work is the first step in construction and production. Paying attention to conservation at this level can avoid waste from the very beginning. Recently, the Power Bureau system has prepared to replace iron towers for overhead high-voltage lines with reinforced concrete poles, many civil buildings in Guangzhou have adopted bamboo reinforced concrete structures, and some construction sites have adopted cold-drawn steel bars. These practices have saved a lot of steel bars and steel and are measures worth popularizing in the capital construction sector. In terms of industrial production, efforts should be made to reduce the weight of products (especially various machinery and electrical equipment) and reduce metal consumption without affecting product performance and quality; improve equipment conditions (especially forging and casting), reduce the machining allowance of parts, and try to use substitutes to save rare metals. Because in these areas, the potential for savings is also very large.
    In daily production and capital construction management, each enterprise unit should revise the unreasonable parts of the metal consumption quota according to the specific situation, in order to fundamentally eliminate the behavior of wasting large amounts of metal. At the same time, whether it is a unit that produces metal or a unit that uses metal, it is necessary to pay attention to taking effective technical and organizational measures, promoting advanced production experience, reducing the scrap rate in the production process, and promoting the use of substitutes and metal saving methods under the condition of ensuring quality. Workers at the Tianjin Bicycle Factory used stagnant materials and waste materials to make parts from January to July, saving 150 tons of steel. Local fire protection material factories have made extensive use of pig iron and plastic to replace copper in the production of various fire protection components. There are many such experiences in enterprises in various places. If each industry system can summarize and promote them, the effect will definitely be great.
    Another important task of metal conservation is to vigorously reduce the amount of reserves in warehouses and strictly manage the storage, receipt, and dispatch system of warehouses. According to the statistics of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry in July, the accumulated channel steel and angle steel in the system under the ministry can be used for 209 days, tool steel can be used for 638 days, structural steel can be used for 249 days, purple copper materials can be used for 416 days, boiler steel plates can be used for 700 days, brass materials can be used for 867 days, and galvanized thin iron plates can be used for 1,935 days. This phenomenon is equally serious in the Heavy Industry Department system. In Anshan Iron and Steel Company alone, the value of accumulated materials is as high as 9.8 million yuan, most of which are metal materials. The result of excessive reserves of metal materials is that, on the one hand, national funds are tied up, and on the other hand, convenience is provided for waste. Therefore, all enterprises and units across the country must conduct a thorough inventory of warehouses again, vigorously reduce the amount of reserves, make full use of various metal materials that have been accumulated for a long time, determine reasonable reserve figures, and strictly establish a scientific storage system and quota material distribution system.
    The work of conserving metal is a national effort, and construction and production units should pay particular attention to it. In these units, leading workers must first establish the idea of comprehensive conservation, and educate all workers and technicians to understand the significance of metal conservation, so as to organize the functional organizations in the enterprise and mobilize the broad masses of employees to participate in the struggle for metal conservation. In conservation work, all metal conservation methods and experiences must be summarized and promoted in a timely manner. Conservation work should become a regular system; units and individuals with achievements in conservation should be commended and rewarded in a timely manner. As long as the broad masses of employees are mobilized, the metal conservation work of construction and production units will definitely be effective; and as long as the conservation work of these units is done well, it will further promote other aspects and all the people to pay attention to metal conservation.

### 严格节约金属

    严格节约金属       
    严格地节约各种金属，是生产和使用金属的单位厉行节约的一个重要方面。自从中央提出全面节约的号召以后，很多部门和企业都开始重视了这方面的工作。在建筑工程的设计中，注意了以钢筋混凝土结构代替钢结构。在工业生产中，注意了减少钢铁的用量和用其它材料代替贵重金属；有的工厂还利用节约的材料，发起了“不领原材料生产日”的运动。而影响最大和群众基础最广泛的，是目前在各地展开的青年节约队的活动，他们在业余时间展开义务劳动，清理积压的材料，拣拾废弃的旧料，回收和利用了成千上万吨的各种金属。这些已经产生了显著的经济效果，初步树立了重视节约金属的风气。
    但是，目前已经取得的成绩，同严格节约金属的要求相比较，还是十分不够的。节约金属必须是一个全民的工作，但直到目前，还并不是每一个企业的领导工作人员、每一个职工和全体人民都了解了节约金属的意义了。为了消除浪费金属的现象，还需要进行广泛的宣传工作和组织工作，而这些我们却还做得很不够。节约金属的途径也是各种各样的，为了使节约金属的工作获致成效，也需要从各方面动手，采取各种具体措施。但是这方面的工作现在也还十分薄弱。
    有些地方，不该多用金属的却多用了。例如建筑结构的安全系数太大，有些厂房可以用钢筋混凝土结构而采用了钢结构，有些民用建筑可以用砖木结构而采用了钢筋混凝土结构，金属铸造时的成品率太低，机器加工业加工部件时留的加工余量太大。另外，大材小用、长材短用的现象也很普遍。一九五四年，仅鞍山钢铁建设公司因为大材小用、损耗率太高两个原因，就损失钢材两千七百多吨。第一机械工业部系统，一九五四年制造机床及动力机械的金属利用率仅为百分之四十五到五十五，差不多有一半的金属料变成了碎屑。这些方面的浪费显然还必须设法克服。
    还有些地方，不该使用金属的也大量使用了金属；或者应该用一般金属材料的，却使用了贵重的材料。例如一般建筑中的门窗、栏杆、栅栏以及日常用的椅子、盆架、柜子等，本可以用其他材料却用金属材料制造；做罐头盒可以用玻璃却使用价钱昂贵的进口的马口铁；许多产品可以利用塑料也大量使用金属。又如门窗插销和活叶本可以用铁的而用了铜；某些机器部件可以用炭素钢而用优质钢或可以用铸铁而用了铜。这些方面显然也还有很多应该节约的。
    此外，由于不负责任和管理不善所造成的浪费也十分惊人。鞍山炼钢厂自解放后开工以来，倒钢渣时经常带出大量的钢水，估计先后扔掉的好钢约在九万七千多吨以上。第一机械工业部所属各厂，由于铸件的废品率高，一九五四年一年报废的铸件达三万吨，价值二千万元。这些都是比较突出的例子。在管理方面，目前各企业采取的节约办法虽然比较多，但是也还不够严密。
    因此，各企业绝不应满足在节约金属方面已经取得的成就，必须进一步加强工作，从各方面堵塞住浪费的漏洞。必须认识到，节约金属是全面节约工作中的一个重要内容，也是社会主义建设事业中一项重要的技术政策。如果所有生产和使用金属的单位都能设法消除各种浪费金属的现象，就可以为国家节省大量的资金，促进社会主义建设的速度。所以节约金属不仅是一个经济问题，而且是一个政治问题。
    在节约金属工作中，设计工作人员负有重大的责任。设计工作是建设和生产的第一步，在这一关注意了节约，就可以在一开始的时候就避免浪费。最近，电业局系统已准备用钢筋混凝土柱代替架高压线的铁塔，广州许多民用建筑采用竹筋混凝土结构，某些建筑工地采用冷拉钢筋，这些做法节省了许多钢筋和钢材，都是值得在基本建设部门中加以推广的措施。在工业生产方面，应该在不影响产品性能和质量的条件下设法减轻产品的体重（特别是各种机械、电气设备），降低金属消耗量；改善设备条件（特别是锻压和铸造），减少部件加工的余量，并设法采用代用品，节约稀有金属。因为在这些方面，节约的潜力也是很大的。
    各企业单位在日常生产、基本建设管理工作中，应根据具体情况，修正金属消耗定额中的不合理部分，以求从根本上消除大量浪费金属的行为。同时，无论是生产金属的或使用金属的单位，都要注意采取有效的技术组织措施，推广先进的生产经验，减少生产过程中的废品率，在保证质量的条件下，推广使用代用品和节约金属的办法。天津自行车厂的工人，从一月至七月，利用呆滞材料和废料做零件，节省了一百五十吨钢。各地消防材料厂曾大量利用生铁和塑料代替铜来生产各种消防部件。这样的经验在各地企业中是很多的，各产业系统如能总结、推广，其效果一定是很大的。
    节约金属的又一个重要工作是大力压缩仓库的储备量和严密仓库的保管、收发制度。根据第一机械工业部七月份统计，该部所属系统积压的工槽钢可用二百零九天，工具型钢可用六百三十八天，结构用型钢可用二百四十九天，紫铜材可用四百十六天，锅炉钢板可用七百天，黄铜材可用八百六十七天，镀锌薄铁板可用一千九百三十五天。这种现象在重工业部系统里同样严重，只是鞍山钢铁公司一个单位，积压的材料价值即达九百八十多万元，其中大部分是金属材料。金属材料超额储备的结果，一方面积压了国家资金，一方面给浪费开了方便之门。因此，全国各企业单位，必须对仓库再次进行彻底的清点，大力压缩储备量、充分利用长期积压的各种金属材料，确定合理的储备数字，严格建立科学的保管制度和定额发料制度。
    节约金属的工作是一个全民的工作，而在建设和生产单位中尤其应该注意。在这些单位中，领导工作人员必须首先树立全面节约的思想，并教育全体工人、技术人员认识节约金属的意义，以便组织企业中的各职能机构和发动广大职工群众参加节约金属的斗争。在节约工作中，对一切节约金属的办法和经验，都要及时加以总结、推广。节约工作应当成为经常性的制度；对节约有成绩的单位和个人，要及时地给予表扬和奖励。只要广大职工群众发动起来了，建筑和生产单位节约金属的工作就一定能收到成效；而只要这些单位的节约工作搞好了，就能进一步推动其它方面和全体人民都来注意节约金属。
