    On the Standardization of the Chinese Language
    Wang Li, Director of the Chinese Language Teaching and Research Group, Peking University

    Chinese is the language of the Han people. As everyone knows, a common language is one of the characteristics of a nation. Therefore, the common language of the Han nationality is one of the fundamental symbols of the Han nationality. Bourgeois linguists, on the one hand, have to admit that the population using Chinese ranks first in the world, but on the other hand, they slander our nation, insisting that the name Chinese refers to a group of mutually unintelligible languages [Note]. Their denial that we have a common language is tantamount to denying that we belong to the same nation. This is obviously nonsense. In fact, we have a written language that has been used in common for thousands of years, which marks the stable community of the Han people. Furthermore, it is natural for a nation like the Han people, with a population of over 550 million, to have more dialects and greater divergences. The degree of understanding varies, which is a fact, but when comparing Chinese dialects with each other, the grammar is basically the same, the vocabulary differences are not significant, and the phonetics have corresponding rules. It can never be said that they are many mutually unintelligible languages.

    While affirming the ironclad fact that the Han nationality has a common language, we must also point out that the common language of the Han nationality has not yet completed its final stage of maturity—a stage with full unified norms. We still need to establish a unified spoken language (oral language) on the basis of a unified written language.

    In the process of socialist construction, the Chinese people's demand for a unified language is unprecedentedly urgent. We know that there are many such facts: graduates of universities and colleges are assigned to work in areas with different dialects, and some people feel uncomfortable with the language and often miss their hometown; some people even delay things because they "don't understand the language" and end up having to transfer jobs. In factories and on basic construction sites, the requirement for Putonghua has already been put on the agenda, as workers from various dialect areas often work together. In rural areas, farmers also demand to learn Putonghua because some staff members are from other provinces. As for the army, soldiers come from all directions, and the importance of a unified language is particularly urgent. Moreover, under the people's regime, many "common people" may have the opportunity to speak at national conferences, which also requires the use of Putonghua. Marxists believe that language, in addition to being a tool for people to communicate and exchange ideas, is also a tool for people to coordinate their joint work in all activities. It can be seen that without this tool of communication, it is impossible to coordinate our joint work. In daily life, due to dialect barriers, it is quite common to buy the wrong thing because of mishearing a word. If this misheard word happens to be the most crucial word in production, it will inevitably lead to unnecessary major losses. These are the harms of language disunity. From a positive perspective, as we march toward the road of socialism, we must adopt all effective methods to develop production. Socialist production cannot be separated from collective life, and collective life cannot be separated from a common language. China is a multi-ethnic country, and there should also be a common language used by all ethnic groups in the common cause of nation-building. Therefore, the new Chinese people's demand for a unified language is completely correct and must be satisfied as quickly as possible.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our country's language workers and education workers are carrying out the work of standardizing the Chinese language. Standardization means requiring the national common language to be more explicit and more consistent. In the past, we only required the written language to be readable and the spoken language to be understandable. Now, being readable and understandable is not enough. We also require the Chinese language to have certain norms.

    On the surface, it seems that the common language of the Han nationality has not yet completed its final stage of maturity, and we are already busy with the work of standardization, as if we are in a bit of a hurry. In fact, this is exactly what we should do, because if there are clear norms that everyone understands, it will further promote the common language of the Han nationality to complete its final stage more quickly. Due to the rapid development of national culture and economy, dialects across the country have gradually converged towards Beijing dialect. The work of standardizing the Chinese language does not hinder their concentration, but helps them concentrate, because clear and consistent norms are precisely the manifestation of high concentration.

    In the process of carrying out the work of standardizing the Chinese language, we may encounter some ideological obstacles. Now, let's discuss a few more common thoughts.

    The first ideological obstacle is the fear of taking a loss. A Guangdong child said: "Why don't Beijing people learn Cantonese, but Cantonese people have to learn Beijing dialect?" This child spoke frankly and said what was in their heart. In fact, many people think this way, believing that promoting Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation is a bargain for Northerners, especially Beijingers, and a loss for Southerners. At the same time, some linguists do emphasize unadulterated Beijing dialect, leading to the misunderstanding that standard modern Chinese is Beijing slang with a strong local flavor. We believe that Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation should be a standardized literary language, so it cannot be unadulterated Beijing dialect. If Beijing slang with a heavy local flavor is taken as the standard for Putonghua, then we will be committing the mistake of linguistic naturalism. However, the standard of Putonghua cannot be fabricated out of thin air, and there must be a living dialect as the basis. From the perspectives of politics, economy, and culture, Beijing dialect is sufficiently qualified as the base dialect. From the facts of hundreds of years, especially the objective facts of recent decades, the formation of the common language of the Han nationality has undoubtedly embarked on this path. The language used in broadcasting, movies, dramas, the phonetic notation in dictionaries, and the Chinese language teaching in many primary schools have long adopted Beijing dialect as the standard. Unless we do not require language unity, dialects from all over the country must look to Beijing dialect as the standard. There is no question of taking a loss or not in this matter. The only question is whether or not we want to unify the language.

    The second ideological obstacle is the fear that it won't work. People with this thought mistakenly believe that the work of standardizing the Chinese language will be carried out in the future through compulsory orders. In fact, this concern is unnecessary. Standardization does not mean forcing people to speak rigidly according to certain formats, and punishing them if they say something wrong. It only adopts a subtle and gradual approach, expanding influence through school education, through broadcasting, movies, and dramas, and gradually achieving the effect of standardization. Taking the written language as an example, we should only require the most important books, newspapers, and magazines to play a demonstrative role in the use of language, and we cannot restrict everyone who writes articles from following a certain format. As for all the excellent personal characteristics in rhetoric and style, they should be promoted rather than restricted. In short, we must distinguish between standards and requirements. It is not only impossible, but also completely unnecessary to train the language of all the Han people to be exactly the same. However, our common language must have a clear standard, so that the masses of the people have something to follow. With the development of politics, economy, and culture, transportation is becoming more and more convenient, and geographical restrictions are decreasing day by day. Language unity is entirely possible. The work of standardizing the Chinese language is not the subjective determination of certain formats by a few people, but rather the planned guidance of the Chinese language to embark on the road to unity in accordance with the internal laws of language development. So-called established convention and taking advantage of the situation will definitely work.

    The third ideological obstacle is the fear of hindering language development. This concern is also unnecessary. Originally, language itself has its constraints. If the whole society speaks this way, you have to speak this way, otherwise your words will not be understood and you will lose the function of a communication tool. Zhao Gao once referred to a deer as a horse, but even today, a deer is still a deer, and a horse is still a horse. This social constraint is also a natural norm. At the same time, everything in the world is developing, and language cannot be an exception. Social constraints can never hinder the development of language. In ancient times, the Han people called ducks "鹜" (wù). At that time, if someone said "鸭子" (yā zi, duck), of course, everyone would not understand. However, with the development of society, Chinese, for some reason (such as absorbing dialects or foreign words), finally had to let "鹜" become "鸭子". Language is stable, but also developing. This is the Marxist dialectical view of language. It is certainly wrong to unilaterally insist on the stability of language and deny its development. However, if we only see the variability of language and therefore deny its norms and do not pay attention to the purity and health of language, it is equally wrong. Literary language is, in a sense, opposed to dialects and colloquialisms. However, it constantly absorbs dialects and colloquialisms to enrich itself. This is also a unity of contradictions. The linguistic giants of past dynasties in China have creatively used clear, vivid, and typical language means to enrich and develop our language. However, we must strictly distinguish between the contributions made by linguistic giants to the enrichment and development of language, and the disruptive behavior of unbridled horses in language use. We cannot agree to oppose the standardization of language under the pretext of caring about the development of language.

    As mentioned above, at present, due to the unprecedented unity of the people across the country, coupled with political, economic, and cultural factors, dialects from all over the country are converging at an unprecedented speed. In this case, the work of standardizing the Chinese language is even more important than at any time, because when the phonetics, vocabulary, and grammar of various places meet, we cannot let them "compete freely" and see them "survive or be eliminated"; we should appropriately guide them so that they can develop according to the internal laws of language development, so that the language continues to become precise, accurate, reasonable, easy to say, easy to write, and easy to understand, so as to benefit social life and facilitate the progress of education, science, and the entire culture. People are by no means powerless to influence the development of language.

    In short, we must recognize the great role of language unity in the cause of national construction. At the same time, we must recognize that the standardization of language can promote language unity. The work of standardizing the Chinese language is a work to which everyone among the 600 million people can contribute. The people across the country should vigorously support this work.

    论汉语规范化 
    北京大学汉语教研组主任　王力
    汉语是汉族人民的语言。大家知道，共同的语言是民族的特征之一。因此，汉民族的共同语言正是汉民族的基本标志之一。资产阶级语言学家一方面不得不承认使用汉语的人口在世界上占第一位，另一方面又污蔑我们的民族，他们硬说汉语这个名称指的是许多种互相听不懂的语言合成的语群〔注〕。他们否认我们有共同的语言，就等于不承认我们同属于一个民族。这显然是一种胡说。事实上，我们有几千年来共同使用的书面语言，它标志着汉族人民的稳定的共同体。再说，像汉族这样一个拥有五亿五千万以上人口的民族，方言较多和分歧较大都是很自然的现象。听懂的程度有高低，这是事实，但是拿汉语方言互相比较着看，语法基本上是相同的，词汇的差别是不大的，语音又有对应的规律，决不能说是互相听不懂的许多种语言。
    在肯定汉民族有共同语言这一件铁一般的事实的同时，我们还必须指出，汉族共同语还没有走完它的最后的成熟阶段——有充分的统一的规范的阶段。我们还需要在统一的书面语言的基础上建立统一的有声语言（口头语言）。
    在社会主义建设的过程中，中国人民对统一语言的要求是空前地迫切了。我们知道有许多这样的事实：高等学校的毕业生分配到不同方言的区域去工作，有些人感觉到语言上不习惯，常常想念家乡；有些人甚至因为“不懂话”而耽误了事情，结果只好调职。在工厂里和基本建设的工地上，由于各方言区的工人都常常在一起工作，普通话的要求已经提到日程上来了。在农村里，由于某些工作人员是外省人，农民们也要求学会普通话。至于部队里，士兵来自四面八方，统一语言的重要性，尤其显得迫切。再说，在人民的政权下，很多“老百姓”都有可能在全国性的会议上发言，那也非用普通话不可。马克思主义者对于语言，除了把它认为是人们交际的和交流思想的工具之外，还认为是使人们在一切活动中调整其共同工作的工具。可见如果没有这个交际的工具，就不可能调整我们共同的工作。在日常生活中，由于方言的隔阂，听错了一个字就买错了一样东西，这是相当常见的事。假使这一个被听错了的字恰巧是生产事业上最关重要的字，那就势必招致不应有的大损失。这些都是语言不统一的害处。再从积极方面说，当我们朝着社会主义的大道迈进的时候，我们要采取一切有效的方法来发展生产，社会主义生产离不了集体生活，集体生活离不了共同语言。中国是一个多民族的国家，在建国的共同事业上，也应该有一种民族间共同使用的语言。因此，新中国人民对统一语言的要求是完全正确的，是必须尽可能迅速地加以满足的。
    在中国共产党的领导下，我国的语言工作者和教育工作者正在展开汉语规范化的工作。所谓规范化，就是要求民族共同语更加明确，更加一致。过去我们对书面语言只要看得懂就算了，对有声语言只要求听得懂就算了，现在看得懂听得懂还不算，我们还要求汉语有一定的规范。
    表面上看来，汉族共同语的成熟还没有走完它的最后阶段，我们就忙着搞规范化的工作，好像是急了一点。实际上我们正是应该这样做，因为如果有了人人了解的明确规范，就更能促使汉族共同语加快地完成它的最后阶段。由于全国文化经济的突飞猛进，全国方言已经逐渐向北京话集中。汉语规范化工作不是妨碍它们集中，而是帮助它们集中，因为明确的、一致的规范正是高度集中的表现。
    在开展汉语规范化的工作过程中，我们可能遇到一些思想障碍。现在举出几种比较普遍的思想来谈一谈。
    第一种思想障碍是怕吃亏。一个广东小孩说：“为什么不要北京人学广东话，而要广东人学北京话呢？”这个小孩心直口快，说出了他的真心话。实际上有不少人也这样想，以为提倡北京音的普通话是北方人上算，特别是北京人上算，南方人吃亏。同时也确实有一些语言学者强调不折不扣的北京话，令人误会标准的现代汉语就是地方色彩很浓的北京土话。我们认为北京音的普通话应该是一种规范化了的文学语言，因此它不可能是不折不扣的北京话。如果把地方色彩很重的北京土话拿来作普通话的标准，那就犯了语言上的自然主义的毛病了。但是普通话的标准也不可能是凭空杜撰出来的，必须有一种活生生的方言作为基础。从政治、经济、文化各方面的条件来说，北京话都足够具备基础方言的资格，而从几百年的事实特别是近几十年的客观事实看，汉民族共同语的形成也已经确定无疑地走上了这一条道路。广播、电影、话剧的用语，字典的注音，很多小学校的汉语教学，都早已采用北京话作标准。除非我们不要求语言统一，否则各地的方言必须向北京话看齐。这上头没有吃亏不吃亏的问题，有的只是要不要统一语言的问题。
    第二种思想障碍是怕行不通。怀着这种思想的人们错误地以为将来会用强迫命令的方式来实行汉语规范化的工作。其实这种顾虑是多余的。所谓规范化，决不是强迫人们说话都死板地遵守一定的格式，说错了要处罚；它只是采取潜移默化的方式，通过学校教育，通过广播、电影、话剧来扩大影响，逐渐收到规范化的效果。拿书面语言来说，也应该只要求最重要的书籍、报纸、杂志在语言的运用上起示范作用，并不能限制每一个写文章的人非依照某一个格式不可，至于修辞和文体上的一切优良的个人特点，那更是应当提倡而不应当限制的了。总之，我们必须把标准和要求区别开来。把全体汉族人民的语言训练得一模一样，那不但永远不可能，而且丝毫不必要。但是我们的共同语言必须有一个明确的规范，使人民大众有所遵循。随着政治、经济、文化的发展，交通一天比一天便利，地域的限制一天比一天减少，语言的统一是完全可能的。汉语规范化的工作，不是由少数人主观地规定某些格式，而是有计划地顺着语言发展的内部规律来引导汉语走上统一的道路，所谓约定俗成，因势利导，那绝对是行得通的。
    第三种思想障碍是怕妨碍语言的发展。这种顾虑也是多余的。本来，语言自身就有它的约束性。全社会都这样说，你就不能不这样说，否则你的话别人就不了解，丧失了交际工具的作用。赵高曾经指鹿为马，但是直到今天，鹿还是鹿，马还是马。这种社会约束性也就是天然的规范。同时，世界上一切事物都是发展的，语言也不能是例外；社会的约束决不能妨碍语言的发展。上古时代汉族人民把鸭子叫做“鹜”。当时假使有人说成了“鸭子”，当然大家都不懂；然而随着社会的发展，汉语由于某种原因（例如吸收方言或外来语），终于不能不让“鹜”变成了“鸭子”。语言是稳固的，同时又是发展的，这是马克思主义语言学对于语言的辩证看法。片面地一口咬定语言的稳定性，否定了它的发展，那当然是错误的；但是，如果只看见语言的可变性，因而否定了它的规范，不注重语言的纯洁和健康，那同样也是错误的。文学语言在一定的意义上是和方言、俗话对立的；但是它又不断地吸收方言、俗话来丰富自己。这也是矛盾的统一。中国历代的语言巨匠们曾经创造性地运用明确的、生动的、典型的语言手段来丰富并且发展我们的语言；但是我们必须把语言巨匠们对语言的丰富和发展所作出的贡献，和不受约束的无缰之马在语言使用上的捣乱行为严格地区别开来。我们不能同意借口关心语言的发展来反对语言的规范化。
    上面说过，目前由于全国人民空前的团结，加上政治、经济、文化的因素，各地的方言正在以空前的速度汇合起来。在这种情况下，汉语规范化的工作比任何时期都显得更重要，因为在各地的语音、词汇、语法碰在一起的时候，我们不能让它们“自由竞争”，看它们“优胜劣败”；我们应该适当地加以引导，使它们能够按照语言发展的内部规律来发展，使语言不断地趋向精密、准确、合理、好说、好写、好懂，以利于社会生活，利于教育、科学和整个文化的进步。人们对于语言的发展，决不是无能为力的。
    总之，我们必须认识语言的统一对祖国建设事业的巨大作用；同时，我们又必须认识语言的规范化能够促成语言的统一。汉语规范化的工作是六亿人民当中每一个人都可以贡献力量的工作；全国人民应该用大力来支持这一工作。
