    Late Liberated Areas Can Also Run Agricultural Cooperatives More and Better
    Zhou Tao, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Qujing Prefectural Committee, Yunnan Province
    In the spring of 1953, Qujing Prefecture, Yunnan Province, experimentally established three agricultural production cooperatives in Qujing and Yiliang counties, where land reform had ended earlier. In the spring of 1954, other counties began pilot projects with a focus, and Yiliang and Qujing counties began developing with a focus and a plan. In the autumn of the same year, each county began key development based on direct experience, and the district party committee carried out key pilot projects. By the spring of this year, the entire prefecture had 1,461 agricultural cooperatives, with 32,448 farm households participating, accounting for 5.8 percent of the total farm households in the prefecture. These agricultural cooperatives were distributed in 396 townships in 88 districts (towns) of the prefecture, of which 11 townships had more than 50 percent of their farm households participating in cooperatives. This autumn, under the specific guidance of the provincial party committee, the Qujing Prefectural Committee further implemented the Central Committee's policy of developing the cooperative movement and carried out a large amount of work to develop agricultural cooperatives throughout the prefecture, which greatly advanced the cooperative movement in the prefecture. Now, the number of agricultural cooperatives in the prefecture has increased to 6,942, with 191,177 farm households participating, accounting for 34.3 percent of the total farm households. All townships in the prefecture, except for 30, now have cooperatives; at the same time, Yiliang, Qujing, and Malong counties have basically achieved cooperativization.
    According to the overall plan of the Provincial Party Committee for the cooperative movement in the province, and in light of the situation in the prefecture, the Qujing Prefectural Committee expects to develop 5,555 new cooperatives and expand 2,454 old cooperatives in 1956, increasing the number of farm households participating to more than 318,000, accounting for 57.17 percent of the total farm households. Eight of the thirteen counties in the prefecture will be basically cooperativized. In 1957, 2,285 new cooperatives will be developed and 5,533 old cooperatives will be expanded, increasing the number of farm households participating to more than 407,000, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total farm households. The entire prefecture will then be basically cooperativized. Based on the enthusiasm of the masses to join cooperatives and the practical experience of developing and consolidating cooperatives in recent years, it is entirely possible to complete this task.
    In recent years, under the specific guidance of the Provincial Party Committee, the cooperative movement in Qujing Prefecture has been led by the Prefectural Party Committee and the County Party Committees, which have attached importance to strengthening the specific leadership of agricultural cooperatives, basically implementing the Central Committee's policy of "active leadership, steady progress." The development of the movement has been healthy and has laid a good foundation for the widespread and in-depth development of the cooperative movement in the future.
    Judging from the situation of the original 1,461 cooperatives, 1,242 cooperatives increased production by an average of 20 percent compared to before the establishment of the cooperatives, and by about 15 percent compared to the average of local mutual aid teams. Including sideline income, the actual income of cooperative members increased by an average of about 24 percent compared to before the establishment of the cooperatives. The other 146 cooperatives, although they did not increase or decrease, ensured that the vast majority of cooperative members increased their income due to the development of diversified operations. The 73 cooperatives that suffered reduced production due to disasters still had an average income of about 15 percent more than local mutual aid teams. For example, the agricultural cooperative led by Zhu Guangzhao in Mahuang Township, Qujing County, experienced a 14 percent reduction in rice production due to drought during rice transplanting this year. However, due to the superiority of unified management, it ensured a bumper harvest of other crops, and the cooperative's income was still 20 percent more than local mutual aid teams, and the actual income of cooperative members increased by an average of 4.7 percent compared to before the establishment of the cooperative. The 90 old cooperatives that were the focus of pilot projects by the County Party Committees have all achieved continuous increases in production. None of the 1,461 old cooperatives in the entire prefecture produced any substandard products. Therefore, the cooperative movement has had a widespread and positive impact on the broad masses of farmers, inspiring their enthusiasm for taking the cooperative road.
    Judging from the development of mutual aid teams, in 1953, less than 50 percent of the farm households in the prefecture participated in mutual aid teams; there were only more than 7,000 year-round mutual aid teams. In the winter of that year, after the general line of the Party during the transition period was vigorously publicized throughout the prefecture, and the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain was implemented, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and farmers was greatly enhanced. In the spring of 1954, each county also focused on pilot projects for agricultural cooperatives, which established a clear banner for the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. As a result, mutual aid teams developed more greatly, and the number of farm households participating in mutual aid teams increased to 82 percent of the total farm households, and the number of year-round mutual aid teams increased to 14,048. In these groups, the Prefectural and County Party Committees have always attached importance to cultivating poor peasant activists as leading backbones, and often used methods such as organizing them to visit old cooperatives to publicize the cooperative policy and educate them on the knowledge of running cooperatives. The poor peasants and some lower-middle peasants generally have a high enthusiasm for running cooperatives, and cooperativization has become the center of rural social opinion. The farmers all said: As long as we listen to Chairman Mao and sincerely take the cooperative road, we will not stumble even with our eyes closed. "Do a good job in production, create conditions, and strive to run cooperatives" has become the action slogan of the mutual aid teams. In the early stage of building cooperatives last autumn, the number of mutual aid teams that collectively applied to build cooperatives exceeded the plans of the Prefectural and County Party Committees by more than four times. Some even selected the director and accountant of the cooperative and ran to the county or district from dozens of miles away to request to learn how to run a cooperative. These facts show that under the education of the Party, cooperativization has become an urgent demand of the broad masses of farmers.
    Through the practice of running cooperatives before this spring, the strength of the Qujing Prefecture to lead cooperativization has also been greatly enhanced. The party committees at the prefecture, county, and district levels have gained direct experience in leading the work of running cooperatives, and more than 800 county and district cadres in the prefecture have learned to lead the work of running cooperatives. More importantly, after the vigorous publicity of the general line in 1953, in the implementation of a series of socialist measures, a large number of poor peasant activists and rural grassroots leading backbones who emerged since the land reform were cultivated and improved. At the same time, tens of thousands of new activists emerged in the entire prefecture. Under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, according to the Central Committee's Party building policy of "active and cautious," Qujing Prefecture has developed more than 14,000 rural party members (including 1,680 ethnic minority party members) and more than 36,000 Communist Youth League members. Party branches have been established in all 952 townships in the prefecture, of which about 40 percent have gained direct experience in leading the work of running cooperatives. This provides an extremely strong guarantee for strengthening the Party's leadership over the cooperative movement.
    This spring, for a period of time, some people one-sidedly exaggerated the problems existing in agricultural production cooperatives, fearing that if too many cooperatives were established, they would not be well consolidated, and spread the negative argument of "it is easy to build cooperatives but difficult to consolidate them," hoping to slow down the pace of cooperative development. Even before the development of cooperatives this autumn, some people were still worried about the "weak foundation" and had no confidence in completing the task of building cooperatives. However, the facts of the development of agricultural cooperatives this autumn fully proved that this argument was wrong.
    This autumn, Qujing Prefecture originally planned to develop 5,000 new cooperatives and expand 895 old cooperatives, with the number of farm households participating reaching 28.8 percent of the total farm households. According to this plan, the Prefectural and County Party Committees carried out a series of ideological and organizational preparations: more than 30,000 key activists for running cooperatives were selected and trained; more than 1,800 staff members were drawn from the prefecture, special district, and county-level organs to directly participate in the work of building cooperatives; the experience of running cooperatives was summarized and exchanged in more than 900 party branches in the prefecture; and old cooperative members were organized to carry out publicity by sharing their experiences in the masses. Because the problem of leading backbones in the mutual aid and cooperation movement was solved, the Party's class policy and voluntary and mutually beneficial policy in rural areas were adhered to, and extensive publicity and mobilization and in-depth connections and mobilization were carried out among the masses, a large-scale mass cooperative movement immediately appeared in the prefecture. The construction of cooperatives in the prefecture ended in mid-September, and 5,481 new cooperatives were actually built, exceeding the original plan by 9.6 percent, and the number of farm households participating increased to 34.3 percent of the total farm households, exceeding the original plan by 19 percent. In the case of large-scale development, the enthusiasm of the old cooperative members has also been further improved. The branch also specifically helped the old cooperatives solve the policy legacy issues and cleaned up impure elements that had mixed into the cooperatives. Of the original 183 weak cooperatives in the entire prefecture, after being rectified in conjunction with the construction of cooperatives, only about 5 per thousand of the households withdrew from the cooperatives, thereby ideologically and organizationally ensuring that the old cooperatives were further consolidated.
    In the movement to build cooperatives this autumn, the party committees at all levels in Qujing Prefecture once again used the old cooperative backbones, used the vivid examples and successful experiences of the old cooperatives, and specifically helped the new cooperatives solve various policy issues, promoted the smooth establishment of the new cooperatives, and enabled the new cooperatives to quickly turn to production after their establishment. Although the number of newly built cooperatives this autumn increased by 2.7 times compared to the spring, because the party branch had experience in running cooperatives and had the old cooperatives as an example, the chaos in production in the early stage of the establishment of the new cooperatives was greatly reduced compared to the time of building cooperatives last autumn. For example, in Xishan Township, Qujing County, two cooperatives were built last spring, and this year it has developed to 14, with the number of farm households participating reaching 84.6 percent of the total farm households. At present, the production of 12 cooperatives has been brought into line, and although there are some problems in the production of two cooperatives, they are also better than the new cooperatives last year.
    On the basis of the smooth establishment of new cooperatives and the consolidation of old cooperatives, the counties in Qujing Prefecture, according to the spirit of the instructions from higher levels, convened cadre meetings and representative meetings to further formulate comprehensive plans for the cooperative movement. Through planning, the branch's leadership of the agricultural production movement centered on cooperativization has become more planned, and the socialist enthusiasm of the masses inside and outside the cooperative has been improved. The farmers generally reflect: They have more hope for socialism, and they must work harder, do a good job in production, and run the cooperative well. For example, after planning in Longhai Township, Fuyuan County, a joint cooperative committee was established under the leadership of the branch, and backbones were matched, so that the new cooperatives and the old cooperatives were linked, and the agricultural cooperatives and the mutual aid teams were linked. Under the encouragement of the cooperative planning and production planning, the farmers in the township, led by the old cooperatives, formed a production upsurge of autumn harvest and autumn planting centered on cooperativization. One group reclaimed more than 300 mu of wasteland. Before planning, only more than 30 women in the township went to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer every day. Now, more than 360 women are mobilized to cut grass and accumulate fertilizer every day.
    More importantly, through the cooperative construction movement this autumn, more than 500 branches and more than 4,000 county, district, and township cadres in the district have gained direct experience in building cooperatives. The number of rural activists has increased by an average of one-third compared to before the construction of cooperatives. The number of rural party members in the district has increased to more than 16,000, and the number of Communist Youth League members has increased to more than 40,000. Together with the broad masses of poor peasants who have joined the cooperatives, they have become a huge force for consolidating these agricultural cooperatives. From these situations, as long as the leadership is firm, correctly understands and fully utilizes these favorable conditions, it is entirely possible to do a good job in consolidating the large number of agricultural production cooperatives newly built this autumn.

    晚解放区也可以把农业合作社办得更多更好
    中共云南省曲靖地委宣传部副部长　周涛
    云南省曲靖专区一九五三年春在土地改革结束较早的曲靖、宜良两县试办了三个农业生产合作社；一九五四年春其他各县开始重点试办，宜良、曲靖两县开始了有重点有计划的发展；同年秋各县又在有了直接经验的基础上开始了重点发展，区委进行了重点试办。到今年春天，全专区共有农业合作社一千四百六十一个，入社农户三万二千四百四十八户，占全专区总农户的百分之五点八。这些农业合作社分布在全专区八十八个区（镇）的三百九十六个乡，其中并有十一个乡入社农户已达百分之五十以上。今秋，曲靖地委在省委的具体指导下，进一步贯彻执行了党中央发展合作化运动的方针，在全专区范围内开展了大量发展农业合作社的工作，使全专区的合作化运动又大大前进了一步。现在，全专区的农业合作社已增至六千九百四十二个，入社农户十九万一千一百七十七户，占总农户的百分之三十四点三。全专区除三十个乡外，已乡乡有社；同时，宜良、曲靖、马龙三个县已基本合作化。
    曲靖地委根据省委对全省合作化运动的总规划，结合本专区情况，预计一九五六年发展新社五千五百五十五个，扩建老社二千四百五十四个，入社农户增至三十一万八千多户，占总农户的百分之五十七点一七，全专区十三个县将有八个县基本合作化。一九五七年发展新社二千二百八十五个，扩建老社五千五百三十三个，入社农户增至四十万零七千多户，占总农户的百分之七十以上，全专区即基本合作化。根据群众入社的积极性和几年来发展社巩固社的实际经验，完成这个任务是完全可能的。
    几年来，曲靖专区的合作化运动在省委具体指导下，地委和各县县委一直都重视了加强对农业合作社的具体领导，基本上贯彻执行了党中央“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，运动的发展是健康的，并为今后合作化运动的广泛深入开展奠定了良好的基础。
    从原有一千四百六十一个社的情况看，有一千二百四十二个社较办社前平均增产百分之二十，较当地互助组平均增产约百分之十五，连同副业收入在内，社员实际收入平均较办社前增加百分之二十四左右。另外的一百四十六个社虽然不增不减，但是由于开展了多种经营，也保证了绝大多数社员增加了收入。因灾减产的有七十三个社，收入仍比当地互助组平均多百分之十五左右。如曲靖县麻黄乡朱光照领导的农业合作社，因今年插秧时干旱，稻谷减产百分之十四，由于发挥了统一经营的优越性，保证了其他作物丰收，社的收入仍比当地互助组多百分之二十，社员实际收入平均较办社前增加了百分之四点七。各县委重点试办的九十个老社都获得了连年增产。全专区一千四百六十一个老社，没有出一个废品。因此，合作化运动在广大农民群众中，已发生了广泛的、良好的影响，启发了农民走合作化道路的积极性。
    从互助组的发展看，一九五三年全专区参加互助组的农户不到总农户的百分之五十；常年互助组只有七千多个。当年冬天在全专区范围内大张旗鼓地宣传了党在过渡时期的总路线，贯彻执行了粮食统购统销政策以后，广大干部和农民群众的社会主义觉悟有了很大提高；一九五四年春各县又重点试办了农业合作社，为互助合作运动的发展树立了鲜明的旗帜：这样互助组有了更大的发展，参加互助组的农户增加到总农户的百分之八十二，常年互助组增加到一万四千零四十八个。在这些组内，地委县委一直都重视了培养贫农积极分子作为领导骨干，并经常运用组织他们参观访问老社等办法，向他们宣传合作化政策和进行办社的知识的教育，贫农和一部分下中农，要求办社的情绪普遍很高，合作化成了农村社会舆论的中心。农民都说：只要听毛主席的话，真心真意走合作化的道路，就是闭着眼睛也不会滚石岩。“搞好生产，创造条件，争取办社”已成了互助组的行动口号。去秋建社初期，集体申请建社的互助组超过地委和县委规划的四倍以上，有的甚至选好了社长、会计，从几十里路以外跑到县上、区上请求学习办社。这些事实说明了在党的教育下，合作化已成了广大农民的迫切要求。
    通过今春以前办社的实践，曲靖专区领导合作化的力量也大大增强了，地、县、区各级党委已取得了领导办社的直接经验，全专区已有八百多个县、区干部学会了领导办社工作。更重要的是，一九五三年大张旗鼓宣传总路线以后，在一系列的社会主义措施的实施中，培养和提高了大量土地改革以来涌现的贫农积极分子和农村基层领导骨干，同时在全专区又涌现了数以万计的新的积极分子。曲靖专区在省委领导下，根据党中央“积极慎重”的建党方针，发展了农村党员一万四千多人（其中有少数民族党员一千六百八十人）和青年团员三万六千多人，全专区九百五十二个乡已建立了党的支部，其中百分之四十左右的支部已取得领导办社的直接经验。这就为加强党对合作化运动的领导提供了极其有力的保证。
    今年春天，有一个时期有些人曾片面夸大了农业生产合作社中存在的若干问题，怕社办多了不好巩固，散播“建社容易巩固难”的消极论调，希望放慢合作化发展的速度。直至今秋发展社以前，也还有人顾虑“基础薄弱”，对完成建社任务没有信心。但是，今秋农业合作社发展的事实完全证明了这种论调是错误的。
    今年秋天，曲靖专区原计划发展新社五千个，扩建老社八百九十五个，入社农户达到总农户的百分之二十八点八。地委、县委根据这个计划进行了一系列的思想上组织上的准备工作：选拔和调训了办社骨干积极分子三万多人；从地、专、县级机关抽调了工作人员一千八百多人直接参加建社工作；在全专区九百多个支部中总结交流了办社经验；组织老社社员在群众中现身说法开展宣传等。由于解决了互助合作运动中的领导骨干问题，坚持了党在农村的阶级政策和自愿互利政策，在群众中展开了广泛的宣传动员和深入的串连发动，全专区立即出现了规模宏大的群众办社运动。九月中全专区建社结束，实际建成新社五千四百八十一个，超过原计划百分之九点六，入社农户增加到总农户的百分之三十四点三，超过原计划百分之十九。在大发展的情况下，老社社员的积极性也进一步提高了，支部又具体帮助老社解决了政策遗留问题，清洗了混入社内的不纯分子，全专区原有一百八十三个薄弱社，经过结合建社进行整顿后，退社农户只占入社农户的千分之五左右，从而在思想上、组织上保证了老社得到进一步巩固。
    曲靖专区各级党委在今秋建社运动中又通过老社骨干，运用老社的生动事例和成功经验，具体帮助新社解决了各项政策问题，推动了新社的顺利建立，使新社在建立后能够迅速转向生产。今秋新建社虽较春天增加了二点七倍，但由于党支部有了办社经验，并有老社作榜样，因此新社建立初期生产上的混乱现象已较去秋建社时大为减少。如曲靖县西山乡去年春天建社两个，今年发展到十四个，入社农户达总农户的百分之八十四点六，目前有十二个社生产已纳入正轨，两个社生产上虽然有些问题，但是也比去年的新社搞得好。
    在新社顺利建成和老社巩固的基础上，曲靖专区各县根据上级指示精神，召开了干部会、代表会进一步制定合作化运动的全面规划。通过规划，支部对以合作化为中心的农业生产运动的领导更有计划了，并且提高了社内外群众的社会主义积极性。农民普遍反映：对社会主义更有盼头了，要更加努力，搞好生产，办好社。如富源县龙海乡通过规划以后，在支部领导下建立了联社委员会，进行了骨干搭配，使新社和老社挂上钩，农业合作社和互助组挂上钩，全乡农民在合作化规划和生产规划的鼓舞下，在老社的带动下，形成了以合作化为中心的秋收秋种的生产高潮。一个组就开了荒地三百多亩，规划前全乡每天只有三十多个妇女去割草积肥，现在每天出动割草积肥的妇女就有三百六十多人。
    更重要的是通过今秋建社运动，全区又有五百多个支部和四千多个县、区、乡干部取得了直接的建社经验，农村积极分子较建社前平均增加了三分之一，全区农村党员增加到一万六千多人，青年团员增加到四万多人，加上已入社的广大贫农，就成了巩固这批农业合作社的巨大力量。从这些情况看，只要领导坚定，正确认识和充分运用这些有利条件，做好今秋新建的大量农业生产合作社的巩固工作是完全可能的。
