Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 27th. Members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Guangdong and Guangzhou Municipal Committees, along with representatives from various sectors of the people, held a symposium on the 27th, indignantly condemning the provocative act of the Portuguese colonial authorities in Macau of preparing to "celebrate" the 400th anniversary of the occupation of Macau.

    Lin Liming, Vice Chairman of the CPPCC Guangdong Provincial Committee, said at the symposium: We Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate the colonialists carrying out such provocative activities in Macau, Chinese territory. Macau is Chinese territory that was occupied by the Portuguese as far back as 1553, under the pretext of needing a place to dry their goods after encountering storms at sea. The Chinese people have the right to demand its return. Lin Liming continued: In the hundreds of years after the Portuguese colonial authorities occupied Macau, they carried out extremely brutal political oppression and economic exploitation of the Chinese people. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Portuguese colonial authorities have consistently adopted a hostile attitude towards the Chinese people, such as harboring many remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, allowing Chiang's bandit "foreign ministry" to set up a commissioner's office in Macau, and colluding with, condoning, and sheltering US-Chiang agents to carry out sabotage activities against the Chinese people. What is particularly serious is that in July 1952, Portuguese soldiers opened fire and invaded our territory of Qianshan. He said that the Chinese people cannot tolerate the hostile attitude and actions taken by the Macau Portuguese colonial authorities towards the Chinese people. The fact that Macau has not yet been returned to China does not mean that the Chinese people will tolerate the situation of Macau being occupied for a long time. The Chinese people must take back their territory from the Portuguese colonialists. Lin Liming added: Our country's foreign policy is a peaceful foreign policy. We have always advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful negotiations. Similarly, we also advocate resolving the issue of recovering Macau through peaceful negotiations. Lin Liming finally warned the Macau Portuguese colonial authorities: China is no longer the China of six years ago, but a China that has already shaken off its colonial shackles. Any act of provocation against the Chinese people is bound to reap its own bitter fruit.

    Qiu Zhe, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC Guangdong Provincial Committee, pointed out in his speech: The Portuguese colonialists occupied Macau hundreds of years ago through pirate-like robbery, bribery, deception, and other means. Now, they are taking provocative actions to hold a so-called "400th Anniversary of Opening the Port," which is intolerable to any Chinese person. The Chinese people actively support the Indian people's demand to recover Goa, Indian territory, from the Portuguese colonialists, and the Chinese people must also recover Macau.

    Non-Party personage Zhang ?cun said: Today, we can no longer tolerate the colonialists committing atrocities on Chinese territory. We demand that the Portuguese colonialists withdraw from Macau and Asia. Macau is Chinese territory and must be returned to China.

    Heads of various democratic parties, mass organizations, professors from various universities, and representatives from workers, women, youth, students, overseas Chinese, and industry and commerce also angrily condemned the Portuguese colonialists for continuing their colonial rule in Macau, China and Goa, India, pointing out that this is not only intolerable to the Chinese people, but also intolerable to the Asian people.

    The more than two hundred participants in the symposium unanimously agreed that the Macau Portuguese authorities must immediately stop all provocative actions, and Macau must be returned to China. Speakers at the symposium emphasized that the Chinese people advocate resolving the issue of recovering Macau through peaceful negotiations, but if the Portuguese authorities think this is a sign of the Chinese people's weakness, they are gravely mistaken. If the Portuguese colonialists dare to continue to take provocative attitudes and actions hostile to the Chinese people, they are bound to reap the bitter fruit.

    政协广东省和广州市委员会委员及各界代表举行座谈会
    愤怒抗议澳门葡萄牙当局的挑衅
    新华社广州二十七日电　中国人民政治协商会议广东省和广州市委员会的委员以及各界人民的代表在二十七日召开了座谈会，愤慨地谴责澳门葡萄牙殖民当局筹备“庆祝”侵占澳门四百周年的挑衅行为。
    政协广东省委员会副主席林李明在座谈会上说：我们中国人民是绝对不能容忍殖民主义者在中国的领土澳门进行这种挑衅性的活动的。澳门是远在一五五三年给葡萄牙人借口海上遇到风浪后要借地方曝晒货物为名而侵占去的中国的领土，中国人民有权利要求收回它。林李明接着说：澳门葡萄牙殖民当局侵占澳门后的几百年中，对中国人民进行了极其残暴的政治压迫和经济剥削。在中华人民共和国成立以后，葡萄牙殖民当局一直对中国人民采取敌视的态度，例如收容许多蒋介石残余匪徒，允许蒋匪外交部在澳设专员办事处，勾结、纵容和包庇美蒋特务进行对中国人民的破坏活动。尤其严重的是，一九五二年七月间，葡兵开枪侵犯我国领土前山。他说，澳门葡萄牙殖民当局对中国人民采取这种敌视态度和行动，是中国人民所不能容忍的。澳门至今还没有归还中国，并不等于说中国人民容忍澳门遭受侵占的情况长久继续下去。中国人民一定要从葡萄牙殖民主义者手中收回自己的领土。林李明又说：我国的外交政策是和平的外交政策，我们一贯主张用和平谈判方式解决国际争端，同样，我们也主张采取和平谈判的方式来解决收回澳门问题。林李明最后警告澳门葡萄牙殖民当局说：中国已经不是六年前的中国，而是已经摆脱了殖民镣铐的中国。任何向中国人民进行挑衅的行为，都必然要自食其恶果。
    政协广东省委员会常务委员丘哲在发言中指出：葡萄牙殖民主义者在数百年前以海盗式的抢劫、行贿、欺骗等手段霸占了澳门，现在又以挑衅性的行动要来举行所谓“开埠四百周年纪念”，这是任何中国人民所不能容忍的。中国人民积极支持印度人民从葡萄牙殖民者手中收回印度领土果阿的要求，中国人民也一定要收复澳门。
    无党无派人士张?村说：今天我们再不能容忍殖民主义者在中国领土上为非作恶了，我们要求葡萄牙殖民主义者从澳门和亚洲撤走，澳门是中国的领土，必须归还中国。
    各民主党派、各群众团体负责人，各高等学校教授以及工人、妇女、青年、学生、华侨、工商界等代表都在会上愤怒地谴责葡萄牙殖民主义者在我国的澳门和印度的果阿等地继续它的殖民统治的罪行，指出这不仅是中国人民不能容忍的，同时也是亚洲人民所不能容忍的。
    参加座谈会的二百多人一致认为，澳门葡萄牙当局必须立即停止一切挑衅性的举动，澳门必须交还中国。座谈会发言的人着重指出，中国人民是主张用和平谈判方式来解决收回澳门问题的，但如果葡萄牙当局以为这是中国人民软弱的表现，那就大错特错了。如果葡萄牙殖民者胆敢继续采取挑衅的敌视中国人民的态度和行为，那它一定要自食其苦果。
