    To Carry Out Cooperative Planning, We Must Mobilize the Masses
    A large-scale agricultural cooperation movement has unfolded across the country, with tens of thousands of farmers already joining or about to join agricultural production cooperatives. To actively and systematically guide this movement, local Party committees at all levels, following the principle of "overall planning, strengthened leadership" proposed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, have formulated comprehensive cooperative plans for their respective provinces, special districts, counties, districts, and townships. In Hebei Province, approximately half of the townships have formulated comprehensive cooperative plans for this winter and spring, as well as for the next three years. In Fujian Province, 20 percent of the townships have completed the planning process, and 40 percent are in progress. Provinces like Zhejiang are summarizing the typical experience of township planning experiments, preparing to conduct them in batches across all townships in the province. The situation in many places indicates that the principle of "overall planning, strengthened leadership" has attracted the attention of Party committees at all levels.
    The importance of comprehensive cooperative planning, especially at the township level, has been fully proven in local practices. In places where actions are earnestly taken according to the comprehensive plan, the Party's leadership is combined with the enthusiasm of the masses, the plans of the leading organs are consistent with the actions of the masses, and people of all social strata, under correct planning and arrangements, find their ideological doubts eliminated, and "everyone is where they should be," feeling that the direction is clear. The leading aspects, because they have clarified the situation and grasped the overall situation, are also confident and proactive in their work. Some village and township cadres said, "Cooperation is a road to happiness, and planning is like a signpost." This is very true.
    However, judging from the comprehensive planning situation in various places, the significance of this work has not been fully understood by all rural workers. Some people do not pay attention to comprehensive planning, and some subjectively compile a plan while sitting in their rooms. As a result, serious detachment from reality and formalism have occurred in the comprehensive planning of these areas. When some townships in Guangdong Province formulated comprehensive plans, the staff did not understand the demands of the majority of farmers, especially the poor farmers, and arbitrarily stipulated the scale and steps for developing cooperatives based solely on personal opinions; the conservative thinking of some of them has not been completely overcome. The Party branch secretary of Meilian Township, Jieyang County, is an upwardly mobile wealthy middle peasant. He often listens to the opinions of wealthy middle peasants and rarely listens to the opinions of poor peasants. When planning, he said: "Old co-op members are still asking to withdraw from the co-op, and not a single person outside the co-op is willing to join. How can we start new co-ops?" In fact, the actual situation is not like this, and many poor peasants are urgently demanding to join the co-op. Therefore, it is necessary to criticize the thinking of wealthy peasants and deeply mobilize the masses in order to formulate a more realistic comprehensive plan.
    Mobilizing and relying on the masses to formulate comprehensive plans is a basic principle. Facts in many places have proven that only by fully mobilizing the masses and attracting them to actively participate in this work can the correctness and rationality of the comprehensive plan be guaranteed, and the satisfaction of the masses can be ensured. After the formulation of the comprehensive plan in Hujiazhuang, Laishui County, Hebei, several upper-middle peasants voluntarily requested to join the cooperative. The township cadres did not conduct any investigation or research and said, "There is no plan for you this year," and did not allow them to join. The so-called plan in this township is not practical at all and has not been discussed by the masses from the bottom up, which is certainly unworkable and useless. Only plans formulated based on the opinions of the masses and specific circumstances can be combined with the demands of the masses and effectively guide the actions of the masses.
    An important link in mobilizing the masses to conduct comprehensive planning lies in deeply publicizing policies, doing a good job in ideological mobilization, and letting co-op cadres and the broad masses of farmers understand the policies of cooperation, especially the policy of relying on poor peasants and consolidating the unity of middle peasants, and understand the benefits and necessity of comprehensive planning. The thinking of Party members, League members, and core members should be cleared first, and they should be used to mobilize the masses. Some poor peasants originally urgently wanted to join the co-op, but were afraid of not being able to invest and afraid that others would not accept them, so they were not actively demanding to join the co-op for a while; while some wealthy middle peasants who did not intend to join the co-op, due to not understanding the policies, were afraid of being discriminated against, so although they had concerns, they were superficially actively demanding to join the co-op. If you are blinded by this superficial and untrue phenomenon, no longer deeply publicize policies, dispel the ideological concerns of the masses, and conduct comprehensive planning on the basis of ideological education, it will cause confusion and bad consequences. The ideological work in Longshan Township, Lianjiang County, Fujian Province, was not done well, and many upper-middle peasants who signed up to join the co-op did so reluctantly because of their heavy ideological concerns. In some townships in Tai'an County, Shandong, some poor peasants were afraid that people would say "joining the co-op is trying to take advantage of others," and although they wanted to join the co-op very much, they did not dare to mention it. If in-depth ideological education is not carried out, how can these ideological concerns be dispelled?
    On the basis of ideological education, we must further mobilize the masses and do a good job in class planning. Ideological mobilization that departs from class policy will be empty talk without political content. When some townships in Guangdong Province conducted comprehensive planning, they neglected class planning and forced certain mutual aid teams to transform into cooperatives, which caused some wealthy middle peasants to be forced to join the cooperatives. There are also some mutual aid team leaders who are wealthy middle peasants, and they hide the enthusiasm of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the team to turn to cooperatives. This phenomenon should also arouse vigilance. Correctly conducting class planning often requires complex ideological struggles. When some townships conduct class planning, they first conduct criticism and self-criticism within the Party, examining and criticizing erroneous thoughts such as excluding poor peasants, restricting poor peasants from joining cooperatives, forcibly pulling middle peasants into cooperatives, and infringing on the interests of middle peasants. After the Party members' thinking is unified, they can then carry out publicity and mobilization to the farmers, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants on the basis of class analysis, and conduct comprehensive planning, which can ensure the implementation of the class line.
    In the development process of the agricultural cooperation movement, the ideological situation of the masses is very complex. Poor peasants, middle peasants, core members, general masses, co-op members, team members, and farmers with various different conditions all have their own plans and consider their own problems. It is necessary to understand the specific situation, dispel their ideological concerns, and carry out reasonable planning according to different requirements. Otherwise, the problem of formalism cannot be avoided. It can be said that the entire process of comprehensive planning is a process of implementing the Party's policies and carrying out meticulous ideological education and organizational work. The idea that the climax has arrived, the masses are very enthusiastic, and there is no need to carry out ideological mobilization is very harmful.
    The cooperative planning of a township or village is the foundation of the entire cooperative planning. Therefore, the role of the village and township Party branches as a fortress in the planning work must be brought into play. That is to say, all ideological and organizational work must be carried out relying on the Party branch as the core. Some places do not rely on the Party branch when conducting planning, but are instead contracted and handled by a small number of cadres or work teams; after the cadres leave, the Party branch is clueless, and the comprehensive plan falls through. In some villages in Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang, district cadres contracted and handled the planning instead, and the masses criticized: "As soon as they leave, the plan is taken away too!" This practice must be prevented and corrected.
    Doing a good job in the comprehensive planning of a township or village means drawing a picture of the development prospects and vision for farmers of all strata in a township or village, and also drawing a general outline for the work of the entire township. However, comprehensive planning is by no means just a phased development plan for cooperatives; it also includes plans for developing production and arranging various rural tasks. Therefore, when formulating a comprehensive plan for developing cooperation, a comprehensive plan for developing production should also be studied simultaneously. This plan will point out the direction of construction to the farmers and will have a great effect on the consolidation and development of cooperatives. Anyang Township, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, recently made a comprehensive plan for developing production, and some farmers who were originally preparing to move down the mountain dispelled their thoughts of going down the mountain and decided to build the mountainous area. In areas with a higher degree of cooperative development, a comprehensive plan for developing production is even more important and should be started immediately.
    Although there is some advanced experience that can be borrowed for implementing comprehensive cooperative planning, this is still a new task for most parts of the country. Only by being diligent, studying hard, and constantly summarizing experience and lessons can it be done well. We must go deep into the masses, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of grassroots organizations and core members, do this work well, and promote the victorious advance of the cooperation movement.

### 进行合作化的规划必须发动群众

    进行合作化的规划必须发动群众
    规模巨大的农业合作化运动已在全国范围内展开，成千上万的农民已经或者就要加入到农业生产合作社里来。为着积极地有计划地领导这个运动，各地各级党委根据党中央和毛泽东同志提出的“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，分别拟订了全省、全专区、全县、全区、全乡的合作化全面规划。河北省约有半数以上的乡制定了今冬明春以及今后三年的合作化的全面规划。福建省有百分之二十的乡结束了制定规划的工作，百分之四十的乡正在进行规划。浙江等省正在总结乡的规划典型试验经验，准备在全省各乡分批进行。许多地方的情况都说明，“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，已经引起各地各级党委的重视。
    合作化的全面规划、特别是乡一级的规划的重要性，在各地实践中得到了充分的证明。凡是认真按照全面规划行动的地方，党的领导和群众的积极性结合起来，领导机关的计划和群众行动一致起来，各阶层群众在正确的规划、安排之下，思想疑虑消除，“各得其所”，就都感到方向明确了；领导方面因为摸清了情况，掌握了全局，也就心中有数，工作主动了。有的乡村干部说：“合作化是条幸福大道，规划好像指路标。”这是说得非常对的。
    但是，从各地进行全面规划的情况看来，这个工作的重大意义，还没有被全体农村工作人员完全理解。有些人还不重视全面规划，有些人是坐在屋子里主观主义地编制一通，这些地区的全面规划因此就发生了严重的脱离实际、形式主义的现象。广东省有些乡制定全面规划，工作人员不去了解广大农民特别是贫苦农民的要求，只凭个人意见，随意规定发展合作社的规模和步骤；其中一部分人的保守思想并没有完全克服。揭阳县梅联乡的党支部书记是上升的富裕中农，他经常听信富裕中农的意见，很少听取贫苦农民的意见，进行规划的时候，他说：“老社员还要求退社，社外群众没一户愿意入社，还能再办新社？”其实，实际情况并不是这样，不少贫苦农民是迫切要求入社。因此，必须批判富农思想，深入发动群众，才能定出比较切实的全面规划。
    制定全面规划必须发动群众和依靠群众，这是一条基本原则。不少地方的事实证明，只有充分发动群众，吸引他们积极参加这个工作，才能保证全面规划的正确、合理，保证群众都能满意。河北涞水县胡家庄制定全面规划以后，有几户上中农自愿要求入社，乡干部不进行任何调查研究，就说，“今年没有规划你们”，不让他们入社。像这个乡的所谓规划根本不切实际，没有经过群众自下而上的讨论，这当然是行不通的、没有用的。只有根据群众的意见和具体的情况拟定出来的规划才能和群众要求相结合，有效地指导群众的行动。
    发动群众进行全面规划的重要环节，在于深入宣传政策，作好思想发动工作，让办社干部和广大农民群众了解合作化的方针政策，特别是依靠贫农、巩固地团结中农的方针，并且懂得全面规划的好处和必要性。应该首先打通党员、团员和骨干分子的思想，经过他们去发动群众。有些贫农本来迫切要求入社，但是害怕无力投资，害怕人家不接收，一时表现并不积极要求入社；而有些本来还不打算入社的富裕中农，由于还不了解政策，害怕被人们歧视，虽然心存顾虑，表面上却是积极要求入社。如果被这种表面的不真实的现象所蒙蔽，不再深入地宣传政策，解除群众的思想顾虑，并在思想教育基础上进行全面规划，就会造成错乱，造成很坏的后果。福建省连江县龙山乡思想工作做的不好，有许多报名入社的上中农，就是由于思想顾虑重重，才勉强报名的。山东泰安县有些乡的一些贫农怕人们说“入社想沾别人光”，虽然很想入社，却不敢提出来。如果不进行深入的思想教育，这些思想顾虑怎样能够打消呢？
    要在思想教育的基础上，进一步发动群众，作好阶级规划。离开阶级政策的思想发动将是没有政治内容的空谈。广东省有些乡进行全面规划的时候，忽视了阶级规划，强使某些互助组转为合作社，这就造成部分富裕中农被迫入社的现象。而有些互助组长是富裕中农，他们隐瞒组内贫农、下中农要求转社的热情。这种现象也要引起警惕。正确地进行阶级规划，常常要经过复杂的思想斗争。有些乡进行阶级规划，首先在党内进行批评和自我批评，检查和批判排斥贫农、限制贫农入社和强拉中农入社、侵犯中农利益等等错误思想。党员思想统一了，再向农民进行宣传动员，在阶级分析的基础上依靠贫农和下中农，进行全面规划，这就能保证贯彻执行阶级路线。
    在农业合作化运动发展过程中，群众的思想情况很复杂。贫农、中农，骨干分子、一般群众，社员、组员，各种不同条件的农民，各有各的打算，各人考虑各人的问题。必须摸清具体的情况，解除他们的思想顾虑，按照不同的要求，进行合理的规划。否则，就不能避免形式主义的毛病。可以说，整个全面规划的过程，就是贯彻执行党的方针政策、进行细致的思想教育和组织工作的过程。那种认为高潮已经到来，群众劲头很大，用不着再进行思想发动的说法，是十分有害的。
    乡或村的合作化规划是整个合作化规划的基础。因此，必须发挥乡村党支部在规划工作中的堡垒作用。这就是说，一切思想和组织工作，都要依靠党支部为核心去进行。有些地方进行规划不依靠党的支部，而由少数干部或工作组代替包办；干部离开以后，党支部摸不着头脑，全面规划就落了空。黑龙江双城县有些村由区干部包办代替进行规划，群众批评说：“他们一走，规划也给带走了！”这种作法必须防止和纠正。
    作好一个乡或村的全面规划，就是给一个乡或村的各阶层农民描绘出了发展前途和远景，也是给全乡的工作划出了大体的轮廓。但是，全面规划绝不仅仅是合作社分期分批发展计划，它还包括发展生产和安排农村各种工作的规划。因此，在拟定发展合作化全面规划的时候，应当同时研究发展生产的全面规划，这种规划会给农民指出建设的方向，对合作社的巩固发展有极大的作用。山西省平顺安阳乡最近作了发展生产的全面规划，有些原来准备搬下山去的农民，打消了下山思想，决心建设山区。在合作化发展程度较高的地区，发展生产的全面规划就显得更为重要，应该立即着手作起来。
    实行合作化全面规划，虽然已有一些先进经验可供借镜，但就全国大部地区来说，这毕竟还是一件新的工作，只有兢兢业业，努力钻研，随时总结经验教训，才有可能把它作好。我们一定要深入群众，发挥基层组织和骨干分子的积极性和创造性，做好这个工作，推动合作化运动胜利前进。
