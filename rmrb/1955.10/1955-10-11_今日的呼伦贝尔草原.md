    Today's Hulunbuir Grassland
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Peng Fengye, A. Jianasidi
    The Hulunbuir Grassland in Inner Mongolia is one of China's largest natural pastures. It is connected to Heilongjiang Province in the east, and borders the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic to the northwest and southwest respectively. The Binzhou Railway runs across the grassland, and the international train from Beijing to Moscow passes through the grassland. People traveling on the grassland often cannot reach the end in a few days and nights, whether from east to west or from south to north. The soil of the grassland is fertile, and the Hailar River, Yimin River and other rivers flowing through the grassland from the Greater Khingan Mountains have alluvialized the grassland into fertile pastures. There are also two famous lakes on the grassland - Hulun Lake and Bel Lake. This vast grassland gets its name from these two lakes.
    More than one million head of livestock, large and small, graze on this rich grassland. Among them are the Sanhe horses, famous throughout the country for their tall and handsome bodies and their ability to be used for both riding and draft work, and the Sanhe cattle, which have a high milk yield. In recent years, herdsmen have actively developed animal husbandry production, and the number of livestock has been increasing year by year. This year, the four pastoral banners have had another bumper harvest, with a total of more than 420,000 livestock bred, with a survival rate of more than 95 percent. At present, there are more than 1,000 temporary seasonal mutual aid teams, more than 30 year-round mutual aid teams and two production cooperatives on the grassland. The animal husbandry production cooperative led by Hu Hete, a representative of the National People's Congress and a labor model, conducted its first profit distribution in July this year. The average income of each male and female laborer was 30 to 50 percent higher than the income of ordinary herdsmen in the area.
    The grassland is now in the season of cutting autumn grass, fattening up livestock for autumn, and preparing for winter. Hundreds of horse-drawn mowing machines are running across the grassland all day long. In the winter pastures, wooden fences and sheds have already appeared. When the severe winter arrives, the whole family of herdsmen will settle down here, ensuring the health of both people and livestock. This combination of settled and nomadic life is being gradually promoted. In Chen Barag Banner, there are more than 90 settled areas, and more than 60 percent of the herdsmen in the banner practice settled nomadism.
    Along the railway from the Greater Khingan Mountains to Manzhouli, more than 30 state-owned farms have now been established, with a total of more than 10,000 adult dairy cows and several thousand Sanhe horses. These state-owned farms not only play a demonstrative and promotional role in the development of animal husbandry production by grassland herdsmen, but will also strongly support the country's industrial and agricultural construction.
    After liberation, the People's Government strengthened medical and health care for herdsmen on the grassland. At present, more than 85 percent of the women giving birth on the grassland are using the new method of delivery. In each sumu (district) and baga (village), there are maternal and child health stations and midwives, fundamentally changing the previous situation of the declining population in pastoral areas year by year. There are more than 20 primary schools and one middle school on the grassland, and more than 1,000 children of herdsmen are studying in these schools.
    Hailar, the political, economic and cultural center of the grassland, has local industries that use livestock products for processing, such as dairy products and leather. The dairy chemical factory can collect tens of thousands of kilograms of fresh milk every day during the peak milk production season. Such a factory that purchases milk in such large quantities is still the first in the country. Leather boots, saddles and other products made by the leather factory using new machines are popular among herdsmen. At present, a large-scale meat joint processing plant is under construction. Herdsmen can satisfy their needs in life and culture when they come to this grassland city. They can see movies and dramas here. A herdsman's guesthouse specially for herdsmen from the grassland has recently been completed, and a cinema and a state-owned store are also under construction. This grassland city receives many visitors from all over the country every year.

    今日的呼伦贝尔草原
    新华社记者　彭逢烨　阿·加那斯弟
    内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原是我国最大的天然牧场之一。它的东边同黑龙江省相连，西北和西南分别同苏联和蒙古人民共和国接壤，滨洲铁路横贯草原，从北京到莫斯科的国际列车经草原出境。人们在草原上旅行，不论从东到西或由南向北，往往几天几夜走不到尽头。草原的土质肥沃，从大兴安岭流经草原的海拉尔河、伊敏河等河流，把草原冲积成一片片肥美的草场。草原上还有两个著名的湖泊——呼伦湖和贝尔湖。这个大草原就是从这两个湖得名的。
    在这富饶的草原上，放牧着一百多万头大小牲畜。其中有驰名全国的体躯高大骏美、乘挽兼用的三河马和产奶量较高的三河牛。几年来，牧民们积极发展畜牧业生产，牲畜连年上升。今年四个牧业旗又得到丰收，共繁殖了各种牲畜四十二万多头，成活率达到百分之九十五以上。现在，草原上已有一千多个临时季节性互助组、三十多个常年互助组和两个生产合作社。由全国人民代表大会代表、劳动模范胡和勒泰领导的畜牧业生产合作社，今年七月间进行了第一次收益分配，平均每个男女劳动力的收入比当地一般牧民的收入多百分之三十到五十。
    草原上现在正是打秋草、抓秋膘和准备过冬的季节，几百台马拉打草机整天在草原上奔驰。在冬季牧场上，已经出现了一座座用木材建造的圈棚，到了严冬，牧民全家老小就要到这里定居下来，使人畜健康都有了保障。这种定居和游牧相结合的方式，正在逐步推行，陈巴尔虎旗已有九十多个定居地，全旗百分之六十以上的牧民实行了定居游牧。
    从大兴安岭到满洲里的铁路两旁，现在已建立了三十多个国营牧场，共有一万多头成年乳牛和几千匹三河马。这些国营牧场不仅对草原牧民发展畜牧业生产起了示范和推动的作用，还将有力地支援国家的工、农业建设。
    解放后，人民政府在草原上加强了对牧民的医疗卫生。现在草原上百分之八十五以上的产妇都实行了新法接生，在每个苏木（区）、巴嘎（村）都有了妇幼保健站和接生员，根本改变了从前牧区人口逐年下降的情况。草原上已有二十多个小学和一所中学，有一千多个牧民的子女在这些学校读书。
    草原的政治、经济和文化中心——海拉尔，有利用畜产品加工的乳品、皮革等地方工业。牛乳化学工厂在产乳的旺季里，每天可以收几万斤鲜牛奶，像这样大量收购牛奶的工厂在全国还是第一个。皮革工厂用新机器制成的皮靴、马鞍等产品，受到牧民的欢迎。现在，一所规模宏大的肉类联合加工厂正在建设中。牧民们到这个草原城市来，生活和文化上的需要都可以得到满足。他们在这里能看到电影和戏剧。一所专供从草原上来的牧民住宿的牧民招待所最近已经建成，另外还在修建一座电影院和一座国营商店。这座草原城市每年都接待很多来自祖国各地参观的客人。
