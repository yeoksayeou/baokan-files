    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, during the war of resistance, led the people of the liberated areas in reclaiming mountain forests and wasteland, breeding livestock, and building many small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, striving to carry out agricultural production to supply military and civilian needs, and powerfully supporting the people's liberation war. After the restoration of peace, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam began to restore the entire national economy, especially the restoration of agricultural production.
    The basic situation of agriculture in North Vietnam in the past was: an agricultural population of over ten million; a total land area of about 180,000 square kilometers, with forests accounting for about 48 percent; cultivated land of about 1.96 million hectares, of which 1.82 million hectares could be planted with rice, and the rest could be planted with tobacco, sugarcane, tea, coffee, cotton, vegetables, etc. In the rice paddies, due to suitable terrain and climate, as well as the construction of irrigation and drainage facilities, 680,000 hectares could be planted with two crops of rice per year, while the rest, either due to low-lying terrain and frequent flooding in autumn, or due to high terrain and insufficient rainfall in spring, and the difficulty of diverting river water, could only be planted with one crop of rice or one crop of miscellaneous grains and one crop of rice per year.
    Before the war of resistance, the Vietnamese people had built a total of thirteen large-scale modern irrigation and drainage projects, irrigating an area of over 300,000 hectares, and medium and small-sized canals, reservoirs, wells, waterwheels and other projects irrigating an area of nearly 100,000 hectares, totaling about 400,000 hectares. More than 2,900 kilometers of river dikes and 720 kilometers of sea dikes were built. There were also many tide-blocking sluices and navigation locks in irrigation canals. In this way, the total rice output in the past reached a maximum of more than 4.2 million tons, and at the same time, about 400,000 tons of corn, sweet potatoes and other miscellaneous grains could be harvested.
    However, due to the long and brutal colonial war launched by French imperialism, the Vietnamese countryside suffered serious damage. In the French-occupied areas, the colonial army created many no-man's lands, with bunkers everywhere, villages along the roads were demolished, bamboo forests and banana trees were cut down, and large amounts of land were abandoned. The area of land that could not be cultivated reached more than 150,000 hectares. As for water conservancy projects, the French colonialists, anticipating in 1952 that they would be unable to recover the areas where these projects were located, and realizing that they could no longer use this powerful tool to continue exploiting Vietnamese farmers, launched a strategic bombing in July of that year, destroying all large-scale irrigation project buildings, and almost all important water conservancy buildings were destroyed. This had a serious impact on agricultural production in the entire North Vietnam. In addition, drought, waterlogging, and floods seriously attacked some areas, and the total agricultural output decreased significantly compared to the past.
    The liberated Vietnamese people have boundless potential. They are fully confident of quickly healing the wounds of war. After the restoration of peace, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, while taking over the newly liberated areas, continued to launch rent reduction movements and land reform struggles in the old liberated areas, and continuously expanded them to the new liberated areas. Up to now, land reform has been completed in areas with a population of over two million, rent reduction has been carried out in areas with a population of nearly eight million, and hundreds of thousands of peasant households have received land, cattle and farm implements, and millions of peasant households have recovered grain and money from landlords. The peasants' enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly high. They have organized mutual aid teams to reclaim wasteland and plant rice on time. Due to the restoration of water conservancy projects and the construction of many small-scale water conservancy projects, the planting area of the first crop of rice reached more than 700,000 hectares, an increase over last year. The peasants have also actively renovated fruit trees and tea gardens, expanded the planting of vegetables and miscellaneous grains; the fishermen have actively increased production; and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has restored the coffee plantations, orchards and animal husbandry businesses it has taken over, and established agricultural scientific research institutions. At the same time, the government has also issued agricultural loans to the peasants and led them to widely carry out production competitions. In this way, in a short period of less than a year, the face of the Vietnamese countryside has been completely renewed.
    Although many areas suffered from drought in the first half of this year, due to the restoration of water conservancy projects and the joint efforts of the military and civilians to pump water to fight the drought, the total grain output still increased by half compared to last year.
    Water conservancy work occupies an important position in the restoration of the national economy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is the key to restoring agricultural production this year, and also the main link for developing agricultural production in the future. At the same time, it is related to the safety of farmland, the capital Hanoi, and the lives and property of people in other cities in the vast plain areas. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attaches great importance to the restoration of water conservancy. In the first annual plan after the restoration of peace, the human and financial resources invested in restoring water conservancy work rank first among all economic sectors.
    The Red River Delta is the main area of agricultural production in North Vietnam, but during the flood season of the Red River, the floods are very large. In the event of a flood that occurs once every fifty years, the flow above Hanoi reaches 30,000 cubic meters per second; in Hanoi, the difference between the highest and lowest water levels of the Red River is ten meters, and the general flood level is four to five meters above the ground, while in the dry season, the water level is much lower than the ground, and although the water volume is abundant, it is not easy to divert water for irrigation. Therefore, floods, waterlogging and pre-season droughts often threaten agricultural production in this area. In the past, the French rulers, only wanting to extract grain from the colony, had built some canals and mechanical pumping irrigation, and completely ignored the management of the Red River. In the past, the Red River broke its banks almost every three years. In 1945, the Red River experienced a major flood, with breaches and overflows everywhere, causing huge losses to the lives and property of the people. What is currently facing the Vietnamese people is to actively carry out the restoration of water conservancy projects, and at the same time, to begin the fundamental management of the Red River. This year, it is first necessary to improve the flood defense capacity of the Red River and several major rivers in the central region, which has significant economic and political significance. The governments at all levels of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have made arrangements in response to this situation, leading the masses to launch large-scale water conservancy construction work.
    Starting in October last year, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam established construction sites in the areas of damaged water conservancy projects, first building temporary earthen dams to block the river water and ensure that the first crop of rice could be irrigated, and then began to repair various concrete structures. So far, except for a few that need to be redesigned, almost all key water conservancy projects have been completed or are about to be completed. For example, the Qiaohe irrigation system in Taiyuan Province, which can irrigate 25,000 hectares, and the Tuokuang sluice gate, which is 100 meters long and 6 meters high, was repaired in January. In the Zhujiang irrigation system in Qinghua Province, which can irrigate 50,000 hectares, the Peishang sluice gate, which is 170 meters long and 20 meters high, was constructed underwater and has been repaired and is now being further reinforced. The Dulian irrigation system of the Lanjiang River in Yian Province not only repaired the intake sluice gate, but also redesigned the water diversion sluice gates and backwater culverts in the main canal, turning them into navigable trunk lines. The nine irrigation systems that have been renovated and built supply irrigation needs for 280,000 hectares of farmland. In the process of construction, there were many difficulties. Without lifting equipment, they used manpower to install the gates; without diving equipment, they found farmers familiar with water to go underwater; lacking tools, they used bamboo, steel rails or manpower to replace them. They overcame the difficulties they encountered with collective wisdom and the strength of the masses.
    At the same time, the governments at all levels of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam universally led the work of dredging irrigation and drainage canals, excavating branch canals in the irrigation areas, renovating drainage culverts, and building small-scale water conservancy projects. The workload of this work is huge, involving about 350,000 hectares of farmland. In May and June, the renovation of dikes was universally launched (some provinces started as early as March), all dike sections were raised and thickened, and stone revetments were strengthened at dangerous points. Sub-dikes were built on each river dike, and the height of the Red River dike sub-embankment was half a meter higher than the maximum flood level in 1945. So far, about 30,000 cubic meters of concrete work and 140,000 cubic meters of stonework have been completed. Earthwork has not yet been counted, and the dike repair alone has exceeded 6 million cubic meters. The nearly 20 million cubic meters of earthwork planned for this year will be exceeded. In the past six months, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has achieved great results in water conservancy, which has guaranteed the harvest of the first crop of rice and laid a material foundation for flood prevention in the rainy season.
    In the water conservancy projects in the second half of the year, not only will all the past projects be fully restored, but the irrigation and drainage areas will also be expanded on the original basis, striving to make these ten-odd large-scale water conservancy projects benefit 375,000 hectares of farmland.

    越南民主共和国农业和水利的恢复工作
    张子林
    越南民主共和国政府在抗战时期就已领导解放区人民开垦了山林荒地，繁殖了耕畜，兴修了许多小型农田水利工程，努力进行农业生产，以供给军需民食，有力地支援了人民解放战争。和平恢复后，越南民主共和国即着手进行整个国民经济的恢复工作，特别是农业生产的恢复工作。
    越南北方过去的农业基本情况是：农业人口一千多万；土地总面积约十八万平方公里，林地约占百分之四十八；耕地约一百九十六万公顷，其中可以种水稻的田地有一百八十二万公顷，其余为可以种烟草、甘蔗、茶叶、咖啡、棉花、蔬菜等的田地。在水稻田中由于地势、气候适宜以及修有灌溉、排水工程设备等，每年能种两季水稻的有六十八万公顷，其余或因地势低洼，秋季常受内涝，或因地势高，春季雨水不足，而引用河水又较困难，每年就只种一季水稻，或一季杂粮一季水稻。
    在抗战前，越南人民共修有大型灌溉的、排水的近代化工程十三处，灌溉面积约三十万多公顷，中、小型的渠道、水库、水井、水车等工程的灌溉面积接近十万公顷，共约有四十万公顷。修筑有江河堤防二千九百多公里，海堤七百二十公里。另有挡潮水闸和在灌溉渠道中的通航船闸等多处。这样，过去水稻总产量最高达到过四百二十多万吨，同时还可以收获约四十万吨的玉米、红薯等杂粮。
    但是由于法国帝国主义所发动的长期惨酷的殖民战争，越南农村遭到严重的破坏，在法国占领区，殖民军队制造了许多无人地带，四处碉堡林立，公路两旁的村庄被拆除，竹林、香蕉树被砍伐，大量土地荒废了，不能耕种的田地竟达十五万多公顷。对水利工程，法国殖民者在一九五二年已预感到自己无力收复这些工程的所在地区，意识到再也不能利用这一有力的工具继续剥削越南农民了，就在那年七月间发动了一个战略轰炸，对所有大型灌溉工程建筑物进行破坏，重要的水利建筑物差不多都被毁坏了。这就更使得整个越南北方的农业生产受到了严重的影响。加上旱、涝和洪水灾害对某些地区的严重袭击，农业总产量比过去下降很多。
    解放了的越南人民是有着无穷的潜力的。他们完全有信心迅速恢复战争的创伤。和平恢复后，越南民主共和国政府一面接收新解放区，一面就在老解放区农村里继续发动了减租运动和土地改革的斗争，并不断地扩大到新解放区。到目前为止已有二百万以上人口的地区完成了土地改革，将近八百万人口的地区进行了减租，几十万户农民得到了土地、耕牛和农具，上百万户农民由地主手中追回了粮食和钱财。农民的生产情绪空前高涨，他们组织变工队进行开荒，按时插上了水稻。由于水利工程的修复和兴修了许多小型水利，第一季水稻耕种面积达到七十多万公顷，比去年增加了。农民们还积极地整修果树茶园，扩大蔬菜、杂粮种植；渔民们积极增加生产；越南民主共和国政府则恢复所接收的咖啡园、果木园和畜牧事业等，并建立了农业科学研究机关。同时，政府又向农民发放了农业贷款和领导农民广泛地开展了生产竞赛。这样，在不到一年的短短时间内，越南农村的面貌已经焕然一新了。
    虽然今年上半年不少地区遭受干旱，但由于水利工程的恢复和军民一起车水抗旱，粮食总产量仍然比去年增加了一半。
    水利工作在恢复越南民主共和国国民经济中占着重要的位置，它是今年恢复农业生产的关键，也是今后发展农业生产的主要环节，同时它又关系到广大平原地区的农田、首都河内和其他城市的人民生命财产的安全。越南民主共和国政府对水利的恢复十分重视，在和平恢复后第一年度计划中，投入恢复水利工作中的人力财力在各项经济部门中占第一位。
    红河三角洲是越北农业生产的主要地区，但是在红河汛期，洪水很大，五十年一遇的洪水，在河内以上，达到三万秒立方公尺；在河内红河最高最低水位差有十公尺，一般洪水位高出地面四至五公尺，而枯水时期，水位又远较地面为低，虽水量丰沛，也不易引水灌溉。所以洪水、内涝和前季干旱经常威胁着这一地区的农业生产。过去，法国统治者只为着要从殖民地中榨取粮食，曾修过一些渠道和机械抽水灌溉，根本不管红河治理。红河过去差不多平均每三年决口一次，一九四五年，红河发生了大洪水，到处在决口漫溢，造成人民生命财产的巨大损失。目前摆在越南人民面前的，是积极地进行水利工程的修复，同时还要开始红河的根本治理。今年首先需要提高红河和中部几条较大河流的防御洪水的能力，这是有着重大的经济和政治意义的。而越南民主共和国各级政府也就针对这种情况作了安排，领导群众展开了大规模的水利兴修工作。
    从去年十月开始，越南民主共和国政府就在被破坏了的水利工程地区建立了工地，一面先做了临时土坝，将河水拦住，保证了第一季水稻能够引水，一面就开始了各种混凝土建筑物的修复，到现在为止，除了少数需要重新设计的以外，差不多带有关键性的水利工程都已完工或即将完工。像太原省可灌二万五千公顷的桥河灌溉系统，长一百公尺、高六公尺的拓况水闸在一月里就修复了。在清化省可灌五万公顷的朱江灌溉系统，长一百七十公尺、高达二十公尺的沛上水闸，是在水下施工的，也已修复了，现正进一步加固。而义安省蓝江都良灌溉系统，不仅修复进水闸，而且将干渠中的被破坏了的分水闸、反水涵洞等建筑物重新经过设计，改为通航干线。目前已整顿和修筑完成的九个灌溉系统，供应了二十八万公顷田地的灌溉需要。在施工过程中，困难是很多的，没有起重设备，他们就用人力来安装闸门；没有潜水工具，他们就找熟悉水性的农民下水；工具缺乏，就用竹子、钢轨或人力来代替。他们用集体的智慧，群众的力量，克服了所遇到的困难。
    同时，越南民主共和国各级政府普遍领导展开了灌溉、排水渠道疏濬，灌溉区内斗毛渠开挖，排水涵洞整修和小型水利兴修的工作，这一工作量是巨大的，所涉及的田地约有三十五万公顷之多。五、六月间，普遍展开了堤防的整修（有的省早在三月就开始了），各个堤段都予以加高培厚，在险工处并加强了抛石护岸。各河堤防并筑了子堤，像红河堤子埝的高度高出一九四五年最大洪水位半公尺。到目前为止，所做混凝土工约三万公方，石工十四万公方，土工还没有统计，仅修堤一项已超过六百万公方，今年所计划的近二千万土方，是会超过的。这半年多以来，越南民主共和国在水利方面所获得的成绩是巨大的，它保证了第一季水稻的收获，并为雨季打下了防汛的物质基础。
    在下半年的水利工程项目中，不仅要全部修复过去的工程，而且要在原有基础上扩充灌溉、排水面积，争取这十几处大型水利工程能使三十七万五千公顷的农田受益。
