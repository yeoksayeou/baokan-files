Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 3rd - According to incomplete election results tallied and announced on the 3rd by the Indonesian Nationalist Party Election Committee, the Indonesian Nationalist Party is leading in all of Java, followed by the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association, the Indonesian Communist Party, and the Masyumi Party.

According to reports from local Indonesian Nationalist Party election committees across Java, the Indonesian Nationalist Party has already received 5,614,000 votes, the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association received 3,964,000 votes, the Indonesian Communist Party received 3,494,000 votes, and the Masyumi Party received 2,950,000 votes.

Java is the most densely populated of Indonesia's more than three thousand islands, with 28.5 million registered voters, accounting for approximately 66 percent of the total number of registered voters nationwide, and will produce 168 of the 260 members of parliament (including Jakarta).

The Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association is gaining the position of the most powerful Islamic party in the country, having defeated the Masyumi Party in many regions.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" reported on the 3rd that, according to complete voting results, the Indonesian Communist Party has definitively taken the lead in the following nine cities: Surabaya, Yogyakarta, Solo, Magelang, Semarang, Cirebon, Kediri, Blitar, and Salatiga.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th - In the nearly complete count of parliamentary election votes in Java, the Indonesian Nationalist Party continues to hold the first position in terms of votes received, followed in order by the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association, the Indonesian Communist Party, and the Masyumi Party. Other parties, including the Indonesian Socialist Party, lag far behind in the number of votes received.

The Indonesian Nationalist Party Election Committee announced on the 4th that the vote numbers for each party in Java—excluding Jakarta and four other voting districts—are as follows: Indonesian Nationalist Party, 6.5 million votes; Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association, 5.2 million votes; Indonesian Communist Party, 4.8 million votes; Masyumi Party, 3.6 million votes.

News of election results from other islands is scarce, but the news indicates that the Masyumi Party is leading in the cities of Medan, Bukittinggi, Palembang, Bangka, and Pontianak.

Indonesian Minister of Internal Affairs Sunaryo told Antara News Agency reporters on the 3rd that if the current work can proceed smoothly, the results of the parliamentary elections can be announced in December.

Indonesian Prime Minister Harahap announced that the cabinet will return its mandate to the President at the first meeting of the new parliament. The cabinet will then be in a state of preparation to step down, awaiting the formation of a new cabinet.
