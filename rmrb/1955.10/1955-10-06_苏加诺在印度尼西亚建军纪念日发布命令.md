Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 5th - According to the Indonesian News Agency, the 10th anniversary celebration of the Indonesian Armed Forces was held in front of the Presidential Palace on the 5th.

President Sukarno, as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, accompanied by Vice President Hatta, reviewed the guard of honor composed of troops from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Cabinet ministers, civil and military officials, and foreign military attaches stationed in Jakarta also attended the celebration.

Commander-in-Chief Sukarno issued an order on Armed Forces Day. In his order, Sukarno said that the armed forces are a tool of the state. This tool is merely the executor of government policies and must obey the state. Sukarno said, "Our country has held general elections for the parliament, and soon it will elect a constitutional assembly. These two elections will determine the future purpose, form, and policies of this country. The armed forces are a tool of the state, and they are now at a decisive moment. In this regard, the tenth anniversary of the armed forces is of great importance. On this important day, I believe it is my responsibility to explain how the armed forces should strive to serve the country in realizing the nation's national ideals."

    苏加诺在印度尼西亚建军纪念日发布命令
    新华社雅加达五日电据印度尼西亚新闻社报道：印度尼西亚建军十周年庆祝仪式五日在总统宫前举行。
    作为武装部队总司令的总统苏加诺在副总统哈达陪同下，检阅了由陆海空三军部队组成的仪仗队。参加庆祝仪式的还有内阁部长，文、武官员和驻雅加达的外国武官。
    总司令苏加诺在建军纪念日发布了命令。苏加诺在命令中说，武装部队是国家的工具。这个工具只是政府政策的执行者，它必须服从国家。苏加诺说，“我国举行了国会普选，不久它将选出一个制宪议会。这两个选举将决定这个国家将来的主旨、形式和政策。武装部队是国家的工具，他们现在处于决定性的时刻。在这一方面，武装部队十周年纪念日，大为重要。在这个如此重要的日子，我认为解释一下武装部队在以实现国家的民族理想方面服务国家应如何努力是我的责任。”
