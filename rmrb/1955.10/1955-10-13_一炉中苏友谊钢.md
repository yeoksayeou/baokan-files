    A Furnace of Sino-Soviet Friendship Steel
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Lou Baoheng

    On the morning of October 8th, a Soviet man wearing white work clothes and blue glasses arrived at the No. 1 open-hearth furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works. The factory director, who accompanied him, introduced him to the steelworkers: "This is Kolesnikov, a steelworker from the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works in the Soviet Union. He is a member of the Soviet youth delegation invited to participate in the National Conference of Active Young Builders of Socialism in our country. He has been awarded the title of ‘Best Steelworker in the Country’ in the Soviet Union. Today, he will work with us to make a furnace of steel." When the workers heard that a Soviet worker would be making steel with them, they excitedly surrounded him. Kolesnikov warmly shook hands with each worker and said, "I haven't made steel for two weeks. Now that I've come to China's largest steel plant, I must participate in making a furnace of steel."

    Kolesnikov went to the furnace and first took a spoonful of steel sample to look at, then ran to the instrument room to observe various meters recording temperature and flow. At this time, there were still four or five hours before tapping, and he would not be able to start refining the next furnace of steel until the afternoon. Someone asked him to rest for a while and come back after lunch, but he smiled and said, "No need to rest, steelworkers have good health!" When someone asked him if they should bring him food, he said, "Just give me a piece of bread." In this way, he worked by the open-hearth furnace until late at night before leaving.

    At about 2:00 PM, the No. 1 open-hearth furnace finished tapping, and the steelworkers and furnace repair workers, under the direction of Kolesnikov, began the intensive work of repairing the furnace. Although people did not understand his words, they could understand his every gesture at a glance. The sides of the furnace were full of people visiting and learning. There were Wang Shouwen and Shan Changju, who had just returned from the National Conference of Active Young Builders of Socialism in Beijing, and apprentice technicians who had recently left school. Everyone had a notebook in hand, their eyes fixed on Kolesnikov's every movement. When charging, Kolesnikov directed the charging machine while increasing the temperature and adjusting the flow; he added a very high temperature when adding the ingredients. Some people worried that the temperature was too high and would burn the top of the furnace, but he said, "Just adjust it frequently."

    The steel materials were melting smoothly. The time for the shift ended, and the workers changed shifts, but Kolesnikov was still full of energy, standing by the furnace. Young foreman Wang Linghao immediately ran to the No. 1 open-hearth furnace after getting off work. He looked through his blue glasses at the slagging situation and said, "The slag situation is very good." Li Shangzhong, Kolesnikov's assistant, said, "At first, I was really worried about Kolesnikov. He is not familiar with the furnace conditions, how can he master it? I was transferred from Furnace No. 7 to Furnace No. 1, and I wasn't sure at first, let alone him coming to China from the Soviet Union. Now you see, he really is the elder brother, this time he has embodied the advanced Soviet experience."

    At a little after nine o'clock, the signal for tapping the No. 1 open-hearth furnace sounded, and the steel, which was the embodiment of the friendship of the workers of China and the Soviet Union, rapidly poured into the steel ladle. The smelting time of this furnace of steel was one hour and thirty-five minutes shorter than the standard time for rapid steelmaking.

    The red light of the molten steel illuminated everyone's happy faces, and at this time, everyone happily lifted Kolesnikov up.

    The next day, on the No. 1 open-hearth furnace where Kolesnikov participated in steelmaking, the steelworkers who had learned his advanced experience produced a furnace of fast steel, creating a new record for fast steelmaking in the entire plant's large open-hearth furnaces.

    一炉中苏友谊钢
    新华社记者　楼葆蘅
    十月八日早晨，鞍钢炼钢厂一号平炉上来了一个穿着白色工作服、戴着蓝眼镜的苏联人，陪他来的厂长向炼钢工人们介绍说：“这是苏联马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁工厂的炼钢工人科列斯尼科夫，是应邀来我国参加全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的苏联青年代表团的团员，他曾荣获苏联‘国家最好的钢铁工人’的称号，今天他要和我们一起炼一炉钢。”工人们听说苏联的工人要和自己一起炼钢，兴奋得把他围了起来。科列斯尼科夫一面和每个工人热情地握手，一面说：“两星期没炼钢了，这回来到中国最大的炼钢厂，我一定要参加炼一炉钢。”
    科列斯尼科夫走到炉子前就先拿起勺子取出一勺钢样看了看，又跑到仪器室里观看了记载着热度、流量的各种仪表。这时，离出钢的时间还有四、五个小时，他要到下午才能开始炼下一炉钢。有人请他休息一下，吃过午饭再来，他笑着说：“不需要休息，炼钢工人身体好！”当别人问他是不是要给他送饭来，他说：“给我块面包就行。”这样，他就在平炉旁一直工作到深夜才离开。
    下午两点钟左右，一号平炉出完了钢，炼钢工人和补炉工人在科列斯尼科夫的指挥下，开始了紧张的补炉工作。虽然人们不懂他的话，但他的每一个手势，工人们一看就能明白。炉子两旁，站满了参观学习的人。这里有刚从北京开完全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会回来的王守文、单长巨，有离开学校不久的见习技术员，每个人手上都拿着笔记本，两眼紧盯着科列斯尼科夫的每一个动作。装料时，科列斯尼科夫一面指挥装料机，一面加高温度和调整流量；他在加料时把温度加得很高。有人担心温度太高会烧化炉顶，他说：“只要勤调整就行。”
    钢料在顺利地熔化着。下班的时间到了，工人们换了班，但科列斯尼科夫还是精力充沛地站在炉子旁。青年工长王凌好一下班，立刻跑到一号平炉来。他隔着蓝眼镜看着正在出渣的情景说：“渣子的情况非常好。”给科列斯尼科夫当助手的李尚忠说：“开始我真替科列斯尼科夫担心，他对炉子情况不熟悉，怎样掌握呢？我从七号炉调到一号炉，开始时心里还没底，何况他从苏联来到中国。现在你看，到底是老大哥，这回把苏联先进经验具体化了。
    九点多钟，一号平炉出钢的信号响了，凝结着中苏两国工人劳动的友谊的钢水迅速地倾泻在钢罐里。这炉钢的冶炼时间比快速炼钢的标准时间缩短了一点零三十五分钟。
    钢水的红光照着大家愉快的面容，这时，大家高兴地把科列斯尼科夫抬了起来。
    第二天，就在科列斯尼科夫参加炼钢的一号平炉上，学习了他的先进经验的炼钢工人们炼出了一炉快速钢，创造了全厂大型平炉快速炼钢的新纪录。
