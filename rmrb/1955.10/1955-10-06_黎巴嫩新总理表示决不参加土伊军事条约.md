Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, October 5th:
    Lebanon’s parliament on the 4th, by a majority vote, expressed its confidence in the foreign policy of the new government headed by Prime Minister Rashid Karami.
    Prime Minister Karami assured the parliament that Lebanon would not participate in the Turkish-Iraqi military treaty under any circumstances. He said that his government rejects any proposal to conclude military alliances with foreign countries.
    He also said that Lebanon completely rejects the so-called new plan for utilizing the water of the Jordan River recently proposed by US President’s special envoy to the Middle East, Eric Johnston.
    Middle Eastern newspapers have pointed out that the United States is attempting, through Johnston's plan, to further control the economies and politics of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Israel, thereby ultimately dragging them into the US-planned Middle East aggressive bloc.

    黎巴嫩新总理表示决不参加土伊军事条约
    新华社五日讯贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩议会在四日以大多数票对以拉布德·卡拉米为首的新政府的外交政策表示信任。
    卡拉米总理向议会保证说，无论在什么情况下，黎巴嫩都不参加土耳其—伊拉克军事条约。他说，他的政府拒绝任何同外国缔结军事同盟的主张。
    他还说，黎巴嫩完全拒绝美国总统驻中东特使埃利克·约翰斯顿最近提出的所谓新的利用约旦河河水的计划。
    中东报纸曾指出，美国企图通过约翰斯顿的计划进一步控制黎巴嫩、叙利亚、约旦和以色列四国的经济和政治，从而最后把它们拉进美国策划的中东侵略集团。
