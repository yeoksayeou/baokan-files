    Emphasize the Repair and Supply of Parts for New-Style Farm Tools
    Zeng Yingquan

    In recent years, supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural departments in various regions have promoted a large number of new-style farm tools in rural areas. From 1950 to the first half of 1955, the nation promoted more than 240,000 units of only seven major farm tools, including double-wheeled double-share plows, double-wheeled single-share plows, disc harrows, spike-tooth harrows, seeders, and harvesters. However, many farm tools have become naturally worn or damaged after long-term use, and some are missing parts. These damaged farm tools and those missing parts need to be repaired and have parts replaced. According to a preliminary survey of 785 villages in Hua County, Henan, about 35 percent of the double-share plows need to be repaired, about 40 percent of the walking plows need to be repaired, and about 50 percent of the waterwheels need to be repaired. After new-style farm tools are successively supplied to farmers, failure to continuously supply parts and help farmers with repairs will inevitably lead to some new-style farm tools being left idle, unable to exert their due effectiveness in agricultural production.

    Currently, some regions are doing a very poor job of repairing and supplying parts for new-style farm tools. In the 13th district of Yushu County, Jilin Province, the main axles of the double-wheeled double-share plows of two agricultural production cooperatives broke. Because there were no repair facilities nearby, they had to carry them to the county seat, 90 li away, to be repaired, costing 21 yuan per axle. The farmers said, "It's good to use this kind of farm tool, but it's a waste of time and money when it breaks." In the 13th district of Dunhua County, Jilin Province, there are more than 100 shovel-cultivators and 13 sets of new-style farm tools, but the supply and marketing cooperative in the district does not deal in parts. Jianhua Agricultural Cooperative in the district requested the supply and marketing cooperative to supply parts three times, but the supply and marketing cooperative ignored them. Yonghua Agricultural Cooperative had to dismantle one shovel-cultivator and combine four into three because they could not buy parts. In Xin Juntun, Fengrun County, Hebei Province, the agricultural cooperative led by Yang Yinchun in Yangzhuang had broken parts in its three waterwheels. Because the local supply and marketing cooperative did not have the parts, they sent people to Tangshan, Hancheng, and Laozhuangzi to purchase them, traveling more than 100 li back and forth, but still failed to buy them. In Yingshang County, Anhui Province, the ground wheel axle of a double-wheeled double-share plow in the Ma Shaoshan Agricultural Cooperative was deformed, and because there was nowhere to repair it, they had to leave it there to "sleep"!

    Now that the autumn plowing season is approaching, in order to ensure that all the new-style farm tools that have been promoted can play their role in the autumn plowing, all regions must do a good job in repairing and supplying parts for new-style farm tools. How to do this well? Based on existing experience, some organizational work can be carried out in the following aspects:

    First, in accordance with the promotion, use, and distribution of new-style farm tools and the needs of farmers, small repair stations (groups) should be established in rural market towns by organizing local iron and woodworking production cooperatives, production groups, or individual handicraftsmen (furnaces, bicycle repair shops, iron and woodworking repair workers) in a planned manner, allowing them to engage in farm tool repair services, and using their original tools, equipment, and technology to serve agricultural production. During the spring plowing and summer planting seasons this year, a total of 305 repair stations, 10 repair points, and 422 fixed and mobile repair teams were established in nine special districts, including Handan and Xingtai in Hebei Province. A total of 2,690 handicraft laborers participated in the repairs. They repaired more than 400,000 pieces of various new and old farm tools for farmers, including more than 1,400 pieces of new-style farm tools and tractor parts, totaling more than 217,000 yuan in repair costs. This not only strongly supported agricultural production, but also promoted the consolidation and development of iron and woodworking handicraft production cooperative organizations. According to statistics from 110 counties (cities) in Henan Province, from 1953 to the first half of 1955, a total of 562 new and old farm tool repair stations and 805 mobile rural furnaces were established. Among them, 92 counties repaired more than 1.1 million pieces of new and old farm tools for farmers in the first half of this year alone. Because the repair facilities are widely distributed and repairs are timely, many local farmers said with satisfaction: With repair stations, we don't have to worry about broken farm tools.

    Second, repair methods must be convenient for farmers. Counties in Heilongjiang Province have adopted a "cyclic operation method" to avoid crowding for farm tool repairs, which has been very effective. The method is to concentrate the farm tools in units of districts, with the technical staff of the agricultural technology guidance stations responsible for checking the extent of damage to the farm tools. General minor repairs are handled by local repair stations; larger repairs (i.e., those that handicraftsmen cannot repair) are handled by iron factories in the county seat. Recently, more than 60 new repair stations have been established in Heilongjiang Province. In the past, some farmers had to travel one or two hundred li to repair a part; now they can repair it at a nearby repair station. In some areas of Hebei Province, repair stations (groups) have adopted the method of sending people to the villages in advance to contact the Party organizations, governments, and agricultural cooperatives to understand the types and numbers of farm tools that need to be repaired, and then agree on repair times to make preparations, which is more convenient for farmers. For example, the Qiucheng Wood Industry Cooperative in She County, Handan Special District, repaired farm tools in a planned manner through such contacts, and successively visited 19 villages in the first half of April this year, repairing farm tools for 23 agricultural cooperatives and some individual farmers, which was welcomed by the farmers.

    Third, ensure excellent repair quality and reasonable prices. Some repair stations (groups) have put forward the slogan of "guaranteed quality and quantity, low prices," which has further established their reputation among the masses. The Tieye Cooperative in Nangong County, Hebei Province, brought printed repair appraisal forms when going to the countryside, with columns printed for quality, price, etc. After repairing the farm tools, they handed the appraisal form to the village staff and the director of the agricultural cooperative or the farmers to sign their opinions on the appraisal form. The West Mao Tieye Group in She County provides good repair quality and fair prices, and the farmers even presented it with a banner. The Baliying Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hua County, Henan Province, formulated standard repair prices based on categories, labor, and materials through joint discussions and research with handicraft workers, with average prices for small, scattered jobs generally 10 to 20 percent lower than those of private furnaces.

    Of course, while strengthening the repair of new-style farm tools, the repair of old-style farm tools should not be neglected; the best way is to combine the repair of new and old farm tools. In addition, relevant departments should actively assist in resolving various difficulties encountered by some handicraft production cooperatives (groups) and handicraftsmen in repairs, such as manufacturing, repair techniques, and lack of parts. Recently, the Liaoning Provincial Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation, the Provincial Department of Agriculture, and the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative have jointly held a training course on the repair of new-style farm tools to teach farm tool repair techniques (including the structure, use performance, disassembly, installation of parts, and repair of new-style farm tools) to the staff of the handicraft production cooperative federations in various counties who are responsible for guiding the repair work and the members of the key county iron industry production cooperatives, in order to effectively solve the difficulties of no one to repair and not knowing how to repair. Supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas are preparing to expand the variety and quantity of parts they handle to meet the needs of repair work. The total value of parts planned to be supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives in Henan, Jilin, Liaoning, and Shaanxi provinces this year will reach more than 1.1 million yuan. These practices are correct and necessary.

    重视新式农具的修配和零件供应工作
    曾映泉
    几年来，各地供销合作社和农业部门在农村推广了大批的新式农具。从一九五○年到一九五五年上半年，全国仅推广双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁、圆盘耙、钉齿耙、播种机、收割机等七种主要农具就有二十四万多部。但是，有不少的农具经过长期使用而自然磨损或用坏了，有些农具缺了零件，这些损坏的和缺零件的农具都需要修理和添配零件。据河南滑县七百八十五个村的初步调查，需要修理的双铧犁约占全部双铧犁的百分之三十五，需要修理的步犁约占百分之四十，需要修理的水车约占百分之五十。在新式农具陆续供应到农民手里后，如果不能源源供应零件和帮助农民修理，必然会使一些新式农具闲置起来，不能在农业生产中发挥应有的效能。
    目前有些地区对于新式农具修配工作是做得很差的。吉林省榆树县十三区有两个农业生产合作社的双轮双铧犁的大轴断了，因附近没有修理机构，只好携到距村九十里的县城去修理，每根大轴花了二十一元。农民说：“使用这种农具好是好，就是坏了既耽误工夫又费钱。”吉林省敦化县十三区有一百多台铲?机和十三套新式农具，但区内供销社没有经营零件。区内建华农业合作社三次到供销社要求供应零件，供销社竟置之不理；永华农业合作社因买不到零件，不得不拆开了一台铲?机，将四台并成了三台。河北省丰润县新军屯杨庄杨印春领导的农业合作社的三辆水车的零件坏了，因当地供销社没有零件，曾派人去唐山、韩城、老庄子等地采购，来回跑了一百多里路，结果还是没买到。安徽省颍上县马绍山农业合作社有一部双轮双铧犁的地轮弯轴变形，由于无处修理，只好摆着让它“睡觉”！
    现在秋耕季节迫近，为了使已经推广下去的新式农具在秋耕中全部发挥作用，各地必须做好新式农具的修配和零件供应工作。如何做好这一工作呢？根据已有的经验，可以从以下几方面进行一些组织工作。
    第一、应当按照新式农具推广、使用、分布的情况和农民的需要，在农村集镇组织当地的铁木业生产社、生产小组或个体手工业者（烘炉、自行车铺、铁木业修理工人）有计划地设立小型的修配站
  （组），让它们兼营农具修配业务，利用它们的原有工具、设备和技术，为农业生产服务。河北省邯郸、邢台等九个专区在今年春耕和夏种期间，共建立修配站三百零五个、修配点十个、固定的和流动的修配小组四百二十二个。参加修配的手工业劳动者共有二千六百九十人。他们共替农民修理各种新旧农具四十多万件，其中新式农具及拖拉机零件一千四百多件，计得修理费二十一万七千多元。这不仅有力地支持了农业生产，还促进了铁、木业手工业生产合作组织的巩固和发展。据河南省一百一十个县（市）的统计，从一九五三年到一九五五年上半年，共设立新旧农具修配站五百六十二个，流动下乡烘炉八百零五盘。其中九十二个县在今年上半年就为农民修配新旧农具一百一十多万件。由于修配机构分布广泛，修理及时，当地许多农民满意地说：有了修配站，坏了农具可不发愁了。
    第二、在修配方法上必须便利农民。黑龙江省各县为了避免农具修配拥挤，采取了“循环作业法”，很有成效。它的作法就是以区为单位把农具集中起来，由农业技术指导站的技术人员，负责检查农具损坏程度，一般的小修配由当地修配站负责；较大的修理（即手工业不能修理的）由县城的铁工厂负责。最近黑龙江省还新成立了六十多个修配站，过去有的农民为了修配一个零件，就得跑一两百里路；现在到附近的修配站就能修配。河北省有些地区的修配站（组）采取提前派人到村跟党组织、政府和农业合作社做好联系，了解群众需要修配的农具品种、件数，然后约定修理时间做好准备的方法，更方便了农民。例如邯郸专区涉县邱城木业社通过这样的联系，有计划地修理农具，在今年四月上半月先后串村十九个，为二十三个农业合作社和一些个体农民修理了农具，受到农民的欢迎。
    第三，要保证修配质量优良和价格合理。有些地区修配站（组）提出：“保质保量、价格低廉”的口号，进一步在群众中树立了信誉。河北省南宫县铁业社下乡带着印好的修配鉴定表，表上印着质量、价格等栏，修理完农具后交村的工作人员和农业合作社主任或农民在鉴定表上签署意见。涉县西茂铁业组修配质量好，价格公道，农民还赠送给它一面奖旗。河南滑县八里营供销社通过和手工业工人共同讨论研究的方式，根据类别、用工、用料等情况，定出标准修理价格，一般零星小活平均低于私人烘炉百分之十到二十。
    当然，在加强新式农具修配工作的同时，对于旧式农具的修配，也不应当忽视；最好的办法是把新、旧农具的修理结合起来。另外，对某些手工业生产社（组）和手工业者在修配中的各项困难，如制造、修配技术、零件缺少等，有关部门应积极协助解决。最近，辽宁省手工业生产联社、省农业厅、省供销社已联合举办新式农具修配训练班，向各县手工业生产联社负责指导修配工作的工作人员和重点县铁业生产社的社员传授农具修配技术（包括新式农具的构造、使用性能、拆卸、安装部件和修配），以切实解决没人修、不会修的困难。有些地区供销社正准备扩大经营零件品种、数量，以适应修配工作的需要。河南、吉林、辽宁、陕西四省供销社今年计划供应零件总值即达一百一十多万元。这些做法是正确的、必要的。
