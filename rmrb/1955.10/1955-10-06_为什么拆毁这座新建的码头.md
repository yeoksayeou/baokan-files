To the Editor:

　　Southwest 602 Paper Mill, due to production needs, began construction in February of last year on a 136-meter-long reinforced concrete cable car loading and unloading pier. However, this pier was demolished shortly after its completion. What exactly happened?

　　It turns out that the Southwest Local Industry Bureau's Capital Construction Department, which was responsible for building the pier, did not conduct thorough investigation and research or collect hydrological data before construction. Consequently, they mistakenly built the cable car pier's trestle bridge too far into the river's center. As a result, when the river's water level rose, it was discovered that the obstructed river water had formed a dangerous shoal (also known as "夹马水" or "Pinching Horse Water"), seriously threatening the safety of passing ships. Moreover, near the cable car pier, due to the rapid currents and strong waves, ships unloading materials for the factory were unable to dock at all.

　　After the pier was demolished, large quantities of steel and concrete beams and columns were discarded on the river滩, and no one has paid attention to them until now. As far as I know, the state invested more than 80,000 yuan in this project. Can state property be treated so irresponsibly? I request that the Paper Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry be responsible for investigating and seriously handling this matter.

### 为什么拆毁这座新建的码头

    为什么拆毁这座新建的码头编辑同志：
    西南六○二造纸厂因为生产需要，去年二月开始建造了一座全长一百三十六公尺的钢筋混凝土的缆车起卸码头。但是这座码头建成后不久就被拆毁了。这到底是怎么回事呢？
    原来，负责修建这座码头的西南地方工业局基本建设处在施工之前，没有周密地进行调查研究和收集水文资料的工作，因而错误地把缆车码头的栈桥道修建得伸入了河心。结果到河水上涨时期，才发现被阻拦了的河水在这里形成了一个险滩（又称夹马水），严重地威胁着来往船只的航行安全；而且在靠近缆车码头的地方，因为水急浪猛，为工厂卸运物资的船只也根本无法靠岸。
    这座码头被拆毁后，大批钢筋和混凝土梁柱被扔在河滩上，直到现在无人过问。据我了解，国家为这项工程投资达八万多元。难道对国家的财产可以这样不负责任地处理了事吗？要求轻工业部造纸工业局负责检查，并严肃处理这件事情。汪仲
