Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, October 23rd: According to TASS, the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of Denmark opened in Copenhagen on the 21st. Five hundred delegates and guests from many countries attended the congress.

    Larsen, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Denmark, delivered a welcome speech to the delegates and representatives of fraternal communist parties.

    Jensen, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Denmark, delivered a political report to the congress on behalf of the Party Central Committee: "The Party's Struggle for the Unity of the Working Class, for Peace, and for National Independence." Jensen analyzed the political situation in the period between the 17th and 18th Congresses, and he criticized the Danish government's policy of joining the North Atlantic military bloc. Pointing out the extension of Danish military service and the large increase in military spending and taxes, Jensen said that the Atlantic's "policy of strength" and arms expansion cannot bring security, freedom, and economic development to our country; on the contrary, it is leading Denmark to an economic crisis.

    Jensen emphasized that international political events that occurred this summer, including the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, demonstrated that small countries can remain outside blocs. This points Denmark to a path of reducing military spending and changing its foreign trade policy.

    Jensen also pointed out that the Party's 18th Congress is being held against a backdrop of growing public dissatisfaction with rising prices in Denmark. The people are demanding that the government take resolute measures to address the consequences of the Atlantic policy. The time has come to choose another path. Among the bourgeois parties, the trend advocating that Denmark take advantage of the opportunities offered by the easing of international tensions is growing stronger.

    Jensen continued that the Communist Party believes that Denmark should take measures to restore its independence, abandon the "policy of strength," and withdraw from the bloc. It must adopt an independent foreign policy and participate in the establishment of a European collective security system, which would protect Denmark from the threat of a resurgent German militarism.

    Jensen emphasized that the Communist Party is ready to cooperate with all those who advocate changing national policy. Any government pursuing a policy of peace can count on the support of the Communists. Denmark should not be in the Atlantic Alliance, but among the neutral countries.

    The congress began a discussion on Jensen's report.

    丹麦共产党第十八次代表大会开幕
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社哥本哈根讯：丹麦共产党第十八次代表大会二十一日在哥本哈根开幕。出席大会的有五百名代表和来自许多国家的来宾。
    丹麦共产党中央委员会主席拉荪向代表大会代表和各兄弟共产党代表们致欢迎词。
    丹麦共产党中央委员会副主席任生向大会作了党中央委员会的政治报告：“党争取工人阶级的团结一致、争取和平和民族独立的斗争”。任生分析了在第十七次代表大会和第十八次代表大会之间这段时期中的政治局势，他指责丹麦政府使丹麦加入了北大西洋军事集团的政策。任生在指出丹麦兵役期限的延长和军费以及赋税的大量增加以后说，大西洋的“实力政策”和扩军政策并不能给我们国家带来安全、自由和经济的发展，相反地，却把丹麦引向经济危机。
    任生着重指出：今年夏天发生的国际政治事件、包括奥地利国家条约的签订，说明了小国有可能处在集团之外。这也就为丹麦指出一条减少军费和改变对外贸易政策的道路。
    任生还指出，党第十八次代表大会是在丹麦人民对物价的不断上涨日益不满的情况下举行的。人民要求政府对大西洋政策的这种后果采取坚决的措施。选择另一条道路的时候已经来到了。在资产阶级党派中，主张丹麦利用国际紧张局势缓和所提供的机会的潮流已日益壮大。
    任生继续说，共产党认为：丹麦应当采取措施以恢复自己的独立，摈弃“实力政策”和退出集团。必须采取独立的外交政策和参加建立欧洲集体安全体系，这样就会使丹麦免受正在复活起来的德国军国主义的威胁。
    任生着重说，共产党准备同所有主张改变国家政策的人合作。任何执行和平政策的政府都可以得到共产党人的支持。丹麦不应该在大西洋联盟中，而应该在中立国家之列。 
    代表大会就任生的报告展开了讨论。
