    In January of this year, we received a letter from reader Ge Xin of the Qingyuan Transportation Station in Liaoning Province, criticizing Jiang Baojin (a Communist Party member), the district chief of the Fifth District of Qingyuan County, for not following the rules for taking the company bus, but instead rudely scolding the conductor and preventing the bus from departing. We immediately forwarded this letter to the Qingyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for investigation and handling, requesting them to promptly inform us of the handling result. In March, we sent another letter urging them to do so. On April 1st, the Qingyuan County Committee Secretariat replied, stating, "We did not receive this letter. We have searched for two days, but we cannot find this letter..." At that time, we thought the letter might have been lost in the mail, so we wrote to the Qingyuan County Committee Secretariat, asking them to contact reader Ge Xin nearby to re-verify the situation reflected in his letter. At the same time, we again requested them to promptly handle this matter and reply to us. After that, we sent another letter urging them to do so, but we never received a reply. It was not until September that the Qingyuan County Committee Secretariat sent us a letter replying to the handling result of this matter; and unexpectedly, the original copy of reader Ge Xin's letter (with our newspaper's publication number on it), which the Qingyuan County Committee Secretariat had definitively stated "did not receive," was also sent back with the reply letter.

    It can be seen from the above facts that the Qingyuan County Committee Secretariat's work in handling letters from the people is unsatisfactory. On the one hand, their registration and filing of letters from the people is not sound enough, resulting in situations where they received letters from the people but could not find them, and then suddenly they reappeared later. On the other hand, their handling of letters from the people is not timely enough. The problem reflected by reader Ge Xin was clearly not difficult to solve, and it should not have taken nearly eight months to be handled.

    It should be pointed out that in the work of handling letters from the people, there are units with even more serious problems than the Qingyuan County Committee Secretariat. Some units have adopted a completely irresponsible attitude towards the letters from the people that we forward to them for handling. For example, on January 14th of this year, we forwarded a letter from a reader exposing a staff member of Tanggou Town, Hudong County, Anhui Province, for abusing his power to play with women and beat the masses to the Hudong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (Hudong County has now been changed to Zongyang County) for investigation and reply to us. We have repeatedly urged them seven times since then, but we have not received a reply for more than nine months. Again, on March 17th, we forwarded a letter from a reader criticizing the Sanchazi Forest Industry Bureau for treating sick workers with an incorrect attitude to the Supervision Office of the Jilin Provincial Forest Industry Bureau for investigation and handling and reply to our newspaper. We have urged them five times since then, but we have not received any response for more than seven months. In the letters urging the above two units, we stated that if the problem was complex and difficult to handle completely in a short period of time, we hoped that they would first inform us of the current situation; we also criticized this delaying attitude towards handling letters from the people, and asked them to examine their work in accordance with the spirit of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" and the "Decision of the State Council on Handling Letters from the People and Receiving the People." However, none of this could move them. This bureaucratic attitude towards letters from the people is intolerable.

    In addition, there are also a small number of units that, although they do not delay or ignore the reader's letters forwarded by our newspaper, they are perfunctory and hasty in their replies. For example, in mid-August, we received a letter from reader Xiao Bai, reflecting the situation that the houses of the People's Visit Reception Room in Haikang County, Guangdong Province, had been occupied for a long time, so we asked the Haikang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to investigate this issue. On October 6th, the Mass Service Group of the Haikang County Committee Office gave us a reply, admitting that the situation reflected by the reader was true. Soon after the People's Visit Reception Room was established, half of the house was used as a material storage room, and later the entire house was used for housing and storing cooking utensils, and it is still the same now. So, how to restore the People's Visit Reception Room to carry out the work of receiving the people's visits? The reply said: "We have instructed the County Government to establish the People's Visit Reception Room, but they said that it cannot be established under the current circumstances. This issue will be further resolved in the future." It seems that in their view, although the situation reflected by the reader that the work of receiving the people's visits is not taken seriously is true, it does not need to be corrected immediately.

    Of course, the units that are irresponsible in handling letters from the people are not limited to the ones mentioned above. Therefore, in addition to requiring these units to correct this situation, we hope that units with similar phenomena can also examine and improve their work in handling letters from the people.

    必须重视处理人民来信的工作
    今年一月，我们收到辽宁省清原运输站读者革新的一封来信，批评清原县第五区区长姜宝金（共产党员）在乘运输公司的班车时不遵守乘车规则，反而蛮横地辱骂乘务员，并且阻拦班车的开行。我们当即把这封来信转请中共清原县委检查处理，要求他们迅速把处理结果告诉我们；在三月份又去信催办。四月一日，清原县委秘书室来信答复说：“我们并没接到此信。我们已查找了两天，也没有这件信……。”当时我们认为来信可能在邮途中丢失了，就去信请清原县委秘书室就近找读者革新重新了解他来信中反映的情况，同时再次要求他们迅速处理这个问题后答复我们。在这以后，我们又曾去信催办，但是一直没有得到答复。直到九月份，清原县委秘书室才给我们来信，答复这个问题的处理结果；而出人意外的是，清原县委秘书室曾经肯定地声明“并没接到”的本报转去的读者革新来信原件（上面编有本报的发文号码）也随着答复信寄回来了。
    从上面的事实可以看出，清原县委秘书室处理人民来信的工作是不能令人满意的。一方面，他们对人民来信的登记档案工作是不够健全的，以致发生收到了人民来信后却查不到、而以后又突然出现了的情况。另一方面，他们对人民来信的处理是不够及时的，像读者革新反映的这个问题显然是不难解决的，不应该拖延了将近八个月才得到处理。
    应该指出，在处理人民来信的工作中，问题比清原县委秘书室更严重的还有。有些单位对于本报转请他们处理的人民来信采取了完全不负责任的态度。例如，今年一月十四日，我们把读者揭发安徽湖东县汤沟镇某工作人员利用职权玩弄妇女和打骂群众的一封来信转请中共湖东县委（湖东县现改为枞阳县）检查并答复我们，以后又连续催办了七次，九个多月来我们始终没有得到答复。又如，三月十七日，我们把读者批评三岔子森林工业局用错误态度对待患病工人的一封来信转请吉林省森林工业局监察室检查处理并答复本报，以后催办了五次，七个多月来也是得不到任何回音。在给上述两个单位的催办信中，我们曾说明如果由于问题复杂，一时难于处理完毕，希望他们把目前的情况先告诉我们；也曾对这种处理人民来信的拖延态度提出批评，要求他们根据中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”和政务院“关于处理人民来信和接见人民工作的决定”两个文件的精神来检查工作。但是，这些都不能使他们有动于衷。这种对待人民来信的老爷态度，是令人不能容忍的。
    另外，也有少数单位对本报转去的读者来信虽然并不是拖延不理，但是在答复时却是敷衍塞责，草草了事。例如，八月中旬我们收到读者小白的来信，反映广东省海康县人民来访接待室的房屋长期被占用的情况，就请中共海康县委检查这个问题。十月六日，海康县委办公室群众服务组给我们一个答复，承认读者反映的情况是事实，人民来访接待室建立以后不久，一半房子就被用作物资储藏室，后来全部房子又都用来住人和堆放炊事用具等，直到现在还是这样。那么，怎样来恢复人民来访接待室开展接见人民来访工作呢？答复中是这样说的：“我们曾责成县府把人民来访接待室建立起来，他们说照此情况是建立不起来的。这个问题待今后再继续解决。”似乎在他们看来，读者反映的这种不重视接见人民来访工作的情况虽然是确实的，但是却无需立即纠正。
    当然，对待处理人民来信工作不负责任的单位还不仅仅是上面提到的这几个。因此，我们除了要求这几个单位纠正这种状况以外，希望有类似现象的单位也能检查和改进处理人民来信的工作。
