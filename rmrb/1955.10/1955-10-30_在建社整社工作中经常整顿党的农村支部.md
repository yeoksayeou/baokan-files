The Party's rural branches are the fighting bastions of the Party in the countryside for implementing the general line. In order to correctly implement the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, and to enable this resolution to have a huge impact on the more than 500 million rural people, it is necessary to frequently rectify the Party's rural branches ideologically and organizationally, so that every Party member can become an active fighter in the socialist revolution, and every branch can become a strong bastion of the socialist revolution. This is a major task of decisive significance for promoting the cooperative movement, and a reliable guarantee for the smooth progress of the large-scale socialist revolution movement of more than 500 million people.

Agricultural cooperation is a class struggle that is more complex and more acute than land reform. This struggle is a serious test and practical exercise for rural Party members. The actual work of the agricultural cooperation movement in recent years has proved that the vast majority of existing rural Party members are loyal to the cause of socialist revolution. More than 80 percent of rural Party members across the country have participated in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and nearly half of them are the backbone of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The active participation of rural Party members in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations has not only vigorously promoted and led the agricultural cooperation movement, but also enabled rural Party members to further enhance their collectivist ideology and socialist awareness, and more clearly understand the goal of striving for the socialist revolution. Since Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions "on the question of agricultural cooperation" were issued recently, Party members who were originally active in the cause of socialist revolution have become even more excited and confident; most of the Party members who originally had a vague understanding of the cause of socialist revolution have also become active. The vast majority of rural branches have a firm determination to implement the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) and lead the agricultural cooperation movement well. This is the basic situation of the Party's rural branches at present. Party committees at all levels must enthusiastically cherish and protect the socialist enthusiasm of Party members, and correctly rely on the Party's rural branches to develop and consolidate the agricultural cooperation movement.

However, some Party members, due to their low class consciousness, cannot withstand the erosion of rich peasant ideology and gradually embark on the wrong path. They either have the conditions to participate but are unwilling to participate in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations, or they cannot correctly implement the Party's class policy and mutual benefit policy in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Within the cooperative, they do not abide by labor discipline, demand more work points, refuse to invest, and even guide agricultural production cooperatives to adopt capitalist management methods, collectively conceal output, and engage in speculative trading activities, thus hindering the continued progress of agricultural production cooperatives. In some backward rural branches, because the leadership of the branch is occupied by economically wealthy and ideologically backward Party members, or manipulated by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, the development of the agricultural cooperation movement is even more seriously hindered. These situations show that in the cooperative movement, the class struggle in the countryside is bound to be reflected within the Party. Therefore, it is necessary to closely integrate Party rectification with cooperative rectification.

The purpose of carrying out Party rectification in the countryside is to correct capitalist ideas and behaviors among Party members, and continuously improve the socialist awareness of Party members and the combat effectiveness of branches. Through Party rectification, every rural Party member should be able to actively publicize the Party's principles, policies, and methods for agricultural cooperation, take the lead in leading the masses to participate in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations, modelly implement the Party's various policies in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations, actively labor, obey production commands, and also raise revolutionary vigilance and carry out unremitting struggle against all phenomena that hinder and undermine agricultural cooperation. Through Party rectification, we must continuously purify, consolidate, and strengthen the Party's rural organizations, improve the leadership of the branch committee, improve the branch's working methods, strengthen the Party's democratic life, and make every rural branch a strong bastion for uniting the peasant masses to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. Therefore, in the work of Party rectification, those Party members who are actively responsible for the cause of socialism should be encouraged and helped to do their work well, so that they can always maintain a humble attitude, always maintain close contact with the masses, constantly examine and improve their ideological style, and constantly strive to improve themselves. Those Party members who are not active enough in the cause of socialism should be given enthusiastic and patient criticism and education to help them become active. Those degenerate and deteriorated Party members, Party members who adhere to capitalist ideas and capitalist exploitation behaviors, should be expelled from the Party without any leniency. Those counter-revolutionaries, landlord-rich peasant elements, and speculators who have infiltrated the Party must of course be purged from the Party; those who have committed criminal acts should also be punished according to the severity of their crimes. In the era of socialist revolution, all rural Party members must be educated to thoroughly draw a line between themselves and capitalism in thought and action.

The specific methods of Party rectification may vary depending on the circumstances of Party organizations in various places. For those branches that have formed a leading core and have the ability to independently carry out work and solve problems, the county and district Party committees may, before the work of Party rectification and cooperative rectification, convene the leading backbone of the township branches, give them short-term training, study and deploy the work of Party rectification and the work of cooperative rectification and cooperative building, and then return to their townships, under the leadership of the county and district Party committees, the branch committees will lead the work of Party rectification and cooperative rectification. For those branches that have not yet formed a leading core and have a small number of Party members, the county Party committee may concentrate Party members in batches by county to carry out Party rectification before cooperative rectification and cooperative building, and deploy the work of cooperative rectification and cooperative building, and then return to their townships, under the leadership of the county and district Party committees and the guidance of the work team, the branch leadership will carry out the work of cooperative rectification and cooperative building. For those backward branches, it is necessary to send a stronger work team, combined with the work of transforming backward townships, to thoroughly rectify them this winter and next spring, change their backward state, and then, according to the circumstances, follow the two methods mentioned above, combined with the work of cooperative rectification and cooperative building, to carry out the work of reorganizing the Party organization.

Regardless of which method of Party rectification is adopted, Party leading organs at all levels should unify the planning and deployment of Party rectification work with the work of cooperative rectification and cooperative building, and closely combine them. In the rural work team, a group of Party member cadres should be selected to take charge of Party rectification work, and they should be held responsible for doing both the work of cooperative rectification and cooperative building, and the work of Party rectification and Party building. Each time Party rectification and cooperative rectification are carried out, the leading organs and leaders should first fully carry out ideological education among Party members, adopt a warm and caring and instructive attitude towards Party members, encourage them to consciously overcome their shortcomings, and help them to continuously improve. In the process of inspecting work, the problems existing in the branch's leadership of the cooperative movement, the attitudes and performance of Party members towards the cooperative movement, and the problems existing in the cooperative should be analyzed and studied in a unified and comprehensive manner, grasping the important key. Generally speaking, the problems within the Party should be solved first, so as to rely on the Party's branches to carry out the work of cooperative building and cooperative rectification, and further educate Party members and improve the leadership level of the branch in the work of cooperative building and cooperative rectification. In this way, the Party's branches can be rectified, and the organization of agricultural cooperatives can be rectified and developed. After the Party branch has established regular leadership over the agricultural cooperation movement, the problems that occur within the cooperative can be easily resolved in a timely manner. In addition, in the work of Party rectification and cooperative rectification, attention must also be paid to rectifying grassroots political power and organizations such as the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation, so that they can play their due role in the agricultural cooperation movement.

Many of the Party members in our Party in the countryside have been tested and tempered by several revolutionary wars and land reforms; the new Party members recruited in recent years are also mostly outstanding elements with class consciousness in land reform and socialist transformation. As long as the Party's leading organs seriously and enthusiastically rectify the branches and strengthen the regular leadership of the branches, the Party members in the countryside will be able to correct their mistakes in a timely manner and actively strive for the cause of socialism, and the Party's branches will certainly be able to unite and organize the broad masses of peasants and correctly realize the Party's historical tasks in the agricultural cooperation movement.

### 在建社整社工作中经常整顿党的农村支部

    在建社整社工作中经常整顿党的农村支部
    党的农村支部是党在农村里贯彻执行总路线的战斗堡垒。为了正确地贯彻执行党的七届六中全会（扩大）“关于农业合作化问题的决议”，使这一决议在五亿多农村人口中发生巨大作用，就必须从思想上和组织上经常整顿党的农村支部，使每一个党员都能成为社会主义革命的积极战士，每一个支部都能成为社会主义革命的坚强堡垒。这是对推进合作化运动具有决定意义的重大工作，是五亿多人口的大规模的社会主义革命运动得以顺利进行的可靠保证。
    农业合作化是一个比土地改革更为复杂更为尖锐的阶级斗争。这种斗争对于农村党员，是一次严重的考验和实际的锻炼。近几年来农业合作化运动的实际工作证明了，现有农村党员中绝大多数是忠实于社会主义革命事业的。全国有百分之八十以上的农村党员已经参加了农业生产互助合作组织，其中有近半数是农业生产互助合作组织中的骨干。农村党员积极参加农业生产互助合作组织，不仅有力地推动和领导了农业合作化运动，同时也使农村党员更加提高了集体主义思想和社会主义觉悟，更加明确地认识了为社会主义革命奋斗的目标。最近毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的指示下达以后，原来对社会主义革命事业积极的党员，更加欢欣鼓舞、信心百倍；原来对社会主义革命事业认识还模糊的党员，大部分也积极起来了。绝大多数的农村支部都有贯彻执行六中全会（扩大）决议、领导好农业合作化运动的坚强决心。这是目前党的农村支部的基本情况。各级党委必须热情地珍视和爱护党员的社会主义积极性，正确地依靠党的农村支部去发展和巩固农业合作化运动。
    但是，也有若干党员由于阶级觉悟不高，经不起富农思想的侵蚀，逐渐走上错误的道路。他们或者有条件参加而不愿意参加农业生产互助合作组织，或者在农业生产互助合作组织中不能正确执行党的阶级政策和互利政策，在社内不遵守劳动纪律，多要工分，不肯投资，甚至引导农业生产合作社采取资本主义的经营管理方法，集体隐瞒产量，进行投机买卖活动，因而阻碍着农业生产合作社继续前进。在农村某些落后支部中，由于支部的领导权被经济富裕、思想落后的党员所占据，或者被地主、富农、反革命分子所操纵，更严重地妨碍着农业合作化运动的发展。这些情况说明了，在合作化运动中，农村中的阶级斗争必然反映到党内来。因此，必须使整党工作同整社工作密切地结合起来。
    在农村进行整党的目的，是要纠正党员中的资本主义思想和行为，不断提高党员的社会主义觉悟程度和支部的战斗力。经过整党，要使每一个农村党员都能积极宣传党的农业合作化的方针、政策和办法，以身作则地带领群众参加农业生产互助合作组织，在农业生产互助合作组织中模范地执行党的各种政策，积极劳动，服从生产指挥，而且要提高革命警惕性，同一切阻碍和破坏农业合作化的现象进行不懈的斗争。经过整党，要不断地纯洁、巩固和壮大党的农村组织，健全支部委员会的领导，改进支部的工作方法，加强党的民主生活，使每一个农村支部都能成为团结农民群众实现农业社会主义改造的坚强堡垒。因此，在整党工作中，对于那些对社会主义事业积极负责的党员，应该鼓励他们，帮助他们做好工作，使他们经常保持谦逊的态度，经常保持同群众的密切联系，不断地检查和改进自己的思想作风，不断地努力提高自己。对于那些对社会主义事业还不够积极的党员，应该热情耐心地向他们进行批评教育，帮助他们积极起来。对于那些蜕化变质的党员，坚持资本主义思想和坚持资本主义剥削行为的党员，则应毫不姑息地开除他们的党籍。对于那些混入党内的反革命分子、地主富农分子和投机分子，当然必须清洗他们出党；有犯罪行为的还应按照他们的罪行大小，依法予以惩处。在社会主义革命时期，必须教育所有农村党员从思想上行动上彻底地同资本主义划清界线。
    整党的具体做法，可以随各地党组织情况的不同而有所不同。对于那些领导核心已经形成、有独立进行工作和解决问题能力的支部，县区党委可在整党整社工作之前，召集各乡支部的领导骨干，加以短期训练，研究布置整党工作和整社建社工作，然后回乡，在县区党委领导之下，由支部委员会领导进行整党和整社工作。对于那些领导核心尚未形成、党员数量不多的支部，县委可在整社建社之前，以县为单位分期分批集中党员进行整党，并布置整社建社工作，然后回乡，在县区党委领导和工作队指导之下，由支部领导进行整社建社工作。对于那些落后支部，必须派遣较强的工作队，结合改造落后乡的工作，在今冬明春彻底加以整顿，改变落后状态，然后分别情况，按照上面说的两种做法，结合整社建社工作进行整理党组织的工作。
    不论采取那种办法整党，党的各级领导机关都应该把整党工作同整社建社工作统一规划，统一部署，紧密地结合进行。在农村工作队中，应该选择一部分党员干部担任整党工作，责成他们既要做好整社建社工作，又要做好整党建党工作。每次整党整社的时候，领导机关和领导人员都应该首先在党员中充分做好思想教育工作，对党员抱着热心关怀和谆谆教导的态度，启发他们自觉地克服缺点，帮助他们不断进步。在检查工作的过程中，应该把支部领导合作化运动中存在的问题，党员对待合作化运动的态度和表现，以及合作社内存在的问题，联系起来作统一全面的分析和研究，抓住重要关键。一般地说，应该先解决党内的问题，以便依靠党的支部进行建社整社工作，并在建社整社工作中进一步教育党员，提高支部的领导水平。这样，就可以既整顿了党的支部，又整顿和发展了农业合作社的组织。在党支部建立了对农业合作化运动的经常领导以后，社内发生的问题就容易得到及时的解决了。此外，在整党整社工作中，也必须注意整顿基层政权和青年团、妇女联合会等组织，使它们在农业合作化运动中发挥应有的作用。
    我们党在农村中的党员，很多是经过几次革命战争和土地改革的考验和锻炼的；近几年来接收的新党员，也大都是土地改革和社会主义改造中具有阶级觉悟的优秀分子。党的领导机关只要严肃地满腔热忱地去整顿支部，加强对支部的经常领导，农村中的党员就能够及时地改正错误，积极地为社会主义事业奋斗，党的支部也一定能够团结和组织广大农民群众，正确地实现党在农业合作化运动中的历史任务。
