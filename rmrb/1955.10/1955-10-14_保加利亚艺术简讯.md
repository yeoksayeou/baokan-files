    Bulgarian Art Briefs
    Achievements in Opera Art
    The Bulgarian people love to sing. Their songs are a reflection of their lives. During the five centuries of darkness under Turkish oppression, songs were the best and most intimate friends of the people. They maintained the national conscience, awareness, and confidence in the final victory over the oppressors. Today, Bulgarian men and women, young and old, are singing about their free and happy country. Thousands of amateur and professional choirs, musical groups, and orchestras throughout the cities and countryside inspire working people to strive for their happy future. The widespread love of singing among the masses is the foundation for the development of Bulgarian opera art.
    In the years since liberation, Bulgarian opera art has achieved remarkable success. The number of opera houses has greatly increased, from only one before liberation to six now, and the artistic level has reached a high degree. Although the history of Bulgarian opera is relatively short—only forty-eight years since the first opera performance—Bulgarian opera singers are known both at home and abroad. The most outstanding among them, such as Ilka Popova, Neli Karova, Raina Mikhailova, Mikhail Popov, Hristo Brumbarov, Todor Mazarov, and others, have been welcomed in performances in European capitals. The performances of young Bulgarian musicians at the recent Warsaw Youth Festival also achieved great success. At this festival, a total of forty-five young Bulgarian singers and instrumentalists won awards, fifteen of whom received first prizes.
    In this year's opera season, the repertoire staged in Sofia's theaters has greatly increased, including famous national and foreign classics and modern works such as: the opera "Momchil" by Bulgarian People's Artist Pipkov, the ballet "Haiduk Epic" by Raichev, the Russian ballet "Swan Lake" by Tchaikovsky, the "Taras Family" by Soviet composer Kabalevsky, "Faust" by French composer Gounod, "Fidelio" by German composer Beethoven, "Halka" by Polish composer Moniuszko, "Sly Peter" by Bulgarian composer Veselin Stoyanov, and "Aida" by Italian composer Verdi, and so on.
    The Sofia People's Theatre
    The Sofia People's Theatre was founded in 1904. Before the establishment of the theater, amateur actors had gone through a difficult and rugged road.
    In 1888, an amateur theater group from Plovdiv came to Sofia for a tour performance. The audience in the capital watched their performance with excitement and requested the group to stay in Sofia. The group did not have a building, so the actors had to raise money to build a wooden theater, which was located on the site of the current Sofia People's Theatre. The group was initially named the Bulgarian People's "Core" Theatre, and the simple wooden house was called the "Core" Theatre. The theater opened in December 1888, staging the plays "Beautiful Shedoniya" and "Red Pants."
    In 1890, the group was reorganized into a drama and opera troupe, divided into drama and opera groups. In 1891, the "Core" Theatre became a professional theater and was renamed the "Tragedy and Comedy" Theatre. In February 1892, the "Tragedy and Comedy" Theatre staged Gogol's "Marriage" and Nalbrov's "Misunderstanding."
    With the establishment of the "Tragedy and Comedy" Theatre, the issue of building a more suitable theater was raised. The construction of the theater was finally completed at the end of 1906. A grand opening ceremony was held in 1907.
    Various classical plays have been successfully performed in this theater. Bulgarian drama is an integral part of the theater's regular repertoire. The theater has also successfully staged famous foreign plays.
    The Moscow Art Theatre, the French "Comédie-Française" troupe, the Yugoslavian Horvat Theatre, and the Vienna City Theatre have all performed on the stage of the Sofia People's Theatre. The Sofia People's Theatre, led by K. Saravov, also visited the Americas.
    Many talented young actors have joined the theater, and they are diligently studying the performing arts of the great director N. Masalitdinov.
    After September 1944, broad possibilities for enjoying the treasures of Russian and Soviet culture appeared before the Bulgarian theater world. Bulgarian, Russian, and some Western European and People's Democratic countries' dramas and classical plays have become the basis of the repertoire of Bulgarian theaters. These dramas and classical plays have had a positive influence on the development of modern Bulgarian drama.
    Soviet directors Petrov, Zavadsky, and Babochkin have provided great help in the reform of Bulgarian drama. Their excellent performances at the Sofia People's Theatre are a real school for Bulgarian actors and directors. In recent years, the Sofia People's Theatre has greatly advanced along the path of realistic development by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. It has become an important factor in Bulgarian cultural construction.
    In the ten years since the establishment of the People's government, the Sofia People's Theatre has staged nearly a hundred plays, including classical and modern dramas and operas from Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and Western countries. These performances have attracted hundreds of thousands of viewers and achieved great success.
    Development of Amateur Art Activities
    There are currently more than 11,300 amateur art groups nationwide in Bulgaria, with 300,000 participants, meaning that on average, one in every twenty-four people in the country is a member of an amateur art group. These art groups are located in both urban and rural areas across the country. Enterprises and institutions all have drama, singing, dance groups, and literary groups. Amateur opera companies have also been established in cities such as Vratsa, Sliven, and Burgas.
    Participants in amateur art activities include workers, staff, farmers, students, and soldiers. The talent and wisdom of the working people are fully displayed in these amateur art groups.
    Amateur art groups often receive help and guidance from various professional art groups, and at the same time, they constantly supplement professional art departments with artistic cadres who possess true talent and cultivation. Many famous actors in Bulgaria, such as People's Opera singer Raina Mikhailova, Meritorious Actor I. Yosifov, Dimitrov Prize winner G. Rudalov, director and actor Filippov, Simov, etc., were originally actors in amateur theater groups. Even many professional art groups have been established on the basis of amateur art groups.

    保加利亚艺术简讯
    歌剧艺术的成就
    保加利亚人民热爱歌唱。他们的歌曲就是他们的生活的反映。在遭受土耳其压迫的五个世纪的黑暗年代里，歌曲曾经是人民的最好、最亲密的朋友。它们保持着民族的良知、觉悟，和最后战胜压迫者的信心。今天，保加利亚的男女老少都在歌唱着自己的自由幸福的国家。城乡各地成千成万个业余的和专业的合唱团，音乐团体和管弦乐队，鼓舞着劳动人民为他们的幸福的未来而斗争。广大人民群众的喜爱歌唱，是保加利亚歌剧艺术发展的基础。
    在解放以后的年代里，保加利亚的歌剧艺术获得了显著的成就，歌剧院的数目大大地增加了，解放前只有一所，现在有了六所，艺术水平达到了很高的程度。虽然保加利亚的歌剧历史较短——自从第一次上演歌剧以来只不过四十八年——保加利亚的歌剧演员却是知名于国内外的。其中最杰出的如伊尔卡·波波娃、涅利·卡洛娃、拉伊娜·米哈伊洛娃、米哈伊尔·波波夫，赫利斯托·勃鲁姆巴洛夫、托多尔·马扎洛夫和其他等人，在欧洲各国首都的演出都受到欢迎，而保加利亚年轻的音乐家们在最近华沙青年联欢节中的演出，也获得很大的成就。在这次联欢节上，共有四十五位年轻的保加利亚歌唱家和演奏家得奖，其中十五人获得了一等奖。
    在今年的歌剧季节里，索非亚各剧院上演的剧目大大地增加了，其中包括了本国和外国的古典和现代的名剧如：保加利亚人民艺术家皮普可夫所作的歌剧“蒙契尔”，拉伊切夫所作的芭蕾舞剧“海杜克的史诗”，俄国柴可夫斯基的芭蕾舞剧“天鹅湖”，苏联作曲家卡巴列夫斯基所作的“塔拉斯一家”，法国戈诺的“浮士德”，德国贝多芬的“费台里奥”，波兰作曲家莫纽什科作的“哈尔卡”，保加利亚作曲家维塞林·斯托扬诺夫所作的“狡猾的彼得”和意大利作曲家维尔第的“阿伊达”等等。
    索非亚人民剧院
    索非亚人民剧院成立于一九○四年。在剧院成立之前，业余演员们曾走过一段艰苦而崎岖的道路。
    一八八八年普罗夫迪夫的一个业余剧团来索非亚作巡回演出。首都的观众怀着兴奋的心情看到他们的演出，并要求这个剧团留在索非亚。剧团没有房子，演员们只好自己出钱建造了一所木板房的剧院，地点就是现在的索非亚人民剧院的原址。剧团开始取名保加利亚人民“基干”剧团，那座简陋的木房叫“基干”剧院。一八八八年十二月剧院开幕了，上演了话剧“美丽的谢东尼娅”和“红裤子”。
      一八九○年该剧团改组为话剧及歌剧团，内分话剧组和歌剧组。一八九一年，“基干”剧团已成为职业剧团，改名“悲喜”剧团。一八九二年二月“悲喜”剧团上演了果戈里的“结婚”和纳尔布罗夫的“误会”。
    随着“悲喜”剧团的成立，建立一所更合适的剧院问题便提出来了。剧院的建筑工程在一九○六年底终于完工了。一九○七年隆重地举行了剧院落成典礼。
    在这个剧院成功地演出过各种古典剧作。保加利亚的话剧是该院经常上演的剧目的组成部分。剧院也成功地演出了外国的名剧。
    曾经在索非亚人民剧院的舞台上演出过的有：莫斯科艺术剧院、法国的“法兰西喜剧”剧团、南斯拉夫的霍尔瓦特剧团、维也纳市剧团等。索非亚人民剧院在科·萨拉弗夫的率领下也曾访问过美洲。
    不少年青的天才演员都加入了这个剧院，他们努力地学习着大导演尼·玛萨利丁诺夫的表演艺术。
    一九四四年九月以后，在保加利亚戏剧界面前出现了享用俄罗斯和苏联文化宝藏的广泛可能性。保加利亚的、俄罗斯的、以及某些西欧国家和各人民民主国家的戏剧和古典剧作，已成了保加利亚各剧院剧目的基础。这些戏剧与古典剧作对于保加利亚现代戏剧的发展起着良好的影响。
    在保加利亚戏剧改革方面苏联的导演彼特洛夫、札瓦德斯基和巴保契金曾给了巨大的帮助。他们在索非亚人民剧院的卓越演出对保加利亚演员和导演来说是真正的学校。近几年来索非亚人民剧院由于学习了苏联的先进经验，从而沿着现实主义发展的道路大大前进了一步。它已成为保加利亚文化建设的重要因素。
    在人民政权建立以后的十年多来，索非亚人民剧院共排演了近百个剧本，其中包括保加利亚、苏联、人民民主国家和西方国家的古典的和现代的戏剧和歌剧。这些演出吸引了数十万观众，获得了巨大的成就。
    业余艺术活动的发展
    保加利亚现在全国总共有一万一千三百多个业余艺术团体，参加者达三十万人，即全国人口平均每二十四人中就有一个是业余艺术团的团员。这些艺术团体遍布全国城乡各地。在企业和机关里，都有戏剧、歌唱、舞蹈团体和文学小组。在弗拉查、斯利文、布加斯等城市还成立有业余歌剧团。
    参加业余艺术活动的有工人、职员、农民、学生和战士等。劳动人民的天才和智慧在这些业余艺术团体中得到了充分的发挥。
    业余艺术团体经常受到各个专业艺术团体的帮助和指导，同时它们也不断地以具有真正的天才和修养的艺术干部补充到专业艺术部门去。保加利亚有很多著名的演员，如人民歌剧女演员拉伊娜·米哈伊洛娃、功勋演员伊·约西弗夫、季米特洛夫奖金获得者格·鲁达洛夫、导演和演员菲利波夫、西莫夫等，原来都是业余剧团的演员。甚至许多专业性的艺术团体也都是在业余艺术团体的基础上成立起来的。
