    The establishment of Xikang Province was abolished on October 1st.
    The Xikang Provincial People's Committee announced on September 30th that the Xikang Provincial People's Committee and its affiliated institutions would cease to exercise their functions and be abolished from October 1st. On October 1st, these agencies all complied with and implemented this decision.
    In order to ensure that the work in various parts of the former Xikang Province would not be affected by changes in leadership institutions, the provincial-level agencies of Xikang Province held "linking" meetings with relevant departments of Sichuan Province in September to discuss issues in the merger work and formulate handover plans. At the same time, they carried out cadre deployment, archive sorting, and other work. The people's committees of the autonomous prefectures and the special administrative offices of the former Xikang Province have also established contact with the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee.

    西康省建制撤销
    西康省建制已在十月一日撤销。
    西康省人民委员会九月三十日公告宣布：西康省人民委员会及所属各机构从十月一日起停止行使职权并撤销。十月一日，这些机关都已遵照执行。
    为了使原西康省各地工作不因领导机构变动受到影响，西康省省级各机关九月份内曾分别和四川省各有关部门举行“挂钩”会议，讨论了各项合并工作中的问题，制定了交接方案；同时进行了干部调配、档案清理等工作。原西康省各自治州人民委员会和各专署也都和四川省人民委员会建立了联系。　（新华社）
