Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 14th: According to TASS, Moscow, October 14th, U.S. President Eisenhower replied to a letter from Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin on October 11th, responding to Bulganin's letter of September 19th on the issue of disarmament.

    Eisenhower began his reply by expressing gratitude for Bulganin's letter. He then said, "You have raised many questions, and I will not be able to answer these until my doctors permit me to do more work than I am presently doing. In any event, a detailed reply will require preparatory work by my advisors, which is actively underway."

    Eisenhower stated in the letter, "However, let me say now that I am encouraged by the fact that you are giving such full consideration to the suggestions I made in Geneva. I hope that we can reach agreement on this suggestion, not as a panacea, but, as I said in Geneva, to express the non-aggressive spirit of both sides in order to create a new atmosphere that can eliminate many of the current fears and doubts. That in itself would be worthwhile. I believe that this would make it more likely to make progress on a broad plan for the inspection, supervision and reduction of armaments, which would satisfy the strong hopes of the people of our two countries, indeed the people of the whole world."

    Eisenhower concluded by saying, "I have not forgotten your suggestion regarding the stationing of inspection teams at key points in our two countries, and if you believe that this would help create the kind of good spirit I mentioned, we can also accept this suggestion."

    艾森豪威尔就裁军问题复信给布尔加宁
    新华社十四日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：美国总统艾森豪威尔十一日复信给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁，答复布尔加宁九月十九日就裁军问题写给他的信。
    艾森豪威尔在复信中首先表示感谢布尔加宁的来信。他接着说：“你提出了许多问题，而我要到医生准许我做多于目前所做的工作时才能答复这些问题。无论如何，一封详细的复信需要我的顾问进行准备工作，这种工作目前正在积极进行。”
    艾森豪威尔在信中说：“但是，让我现在说，我因为你对我在日内瓦提出的建议正在作这样充分的考虑而感到鼓舞。我希望我们能够就这个建议取得一致意见，不是作为一种万灵药，而是像我在日内瓦所说的那样，表示双方的非侵略性的精神，以便造成一种可以消除目前的许多恐惧和怀疑的新气氛。这一点本身就是值得做的。我相信，这样就能够使得更有可能在关于军备的视察、监督和裁减的广泛计划方面取得进展，而这就会满足我们两国人民，事实上满足全世界人民的强烈的希望。”
    艾森豪威尔最后说：“我并没有忘记你所提出的关于在我们两国的关键地点驻留视察小组的建议，如果你认为这一点有助于创造我所提到的那种良好的精神，我们也能接受这个建议。”
