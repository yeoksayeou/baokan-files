    Shanghai's Private Cotton Textile Industry Fully Implements Joint State-Private Ownership
    On September 28th, the twenty-three private cotton textile factories in Shanghai held a joint ownership convention to celebrate the full implementation of joint state-private ownership. Now, Shanghai's private cotton textile industry has entirely embarked on the path of the advanced form of state capitalism.
    The private cotton textile industry is the largest industry in Shanghai. As early as 1950 to 1951, nine private cotton textile factories had already implemented joint state-private ownership, with more added gradually afterward. In the first half of this year, the capitalists of twenty-three factories successively submitted applications for joint state-private ownership to the People's Government, and with the approval of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, preparatory work for joint ownership began in August.
    At the joint ownership convention, Rong Yiren, Executive Chairman of the convention and General Manager of Shenxin Textile Printing and Dyeing Co., Ltd., reported on the preparations for the joint ownership of the entire industry. He said: The joint operation of the twenty-three factories is handled in a coordinated manner according to the principles of "reduction, merger, alteration, and combination" to enable the rational use of human, material, and financial resources, and to fully leverage potential strengths, which is conducive to overall planning and unified production arrangements. During the joint ownership preparations, full consultations were conducted between the public and private sides to ensure that the asset verification and share determination work was fair, reasonable, and based on facts. In personnel arrangements, all private-side executives were properly placed.
    At the meeting, Liu Shuzhou, Director of the United Front Work Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave instructions. He explained that joint ownership of the entire industry, compared with individual joint ownership on a factory-by-factory basis, has many advantages in implementing joint ownership and in future production arrangements and administrative management. He pointed out that after the joint operation of enterprises, the task of transforming enterprises and transforming ideology is still a long, arduous, and complex struggle. All employees should actively participate in enterprise reform and transformation under the leadership of the Communist Party, public representatives, and trade unions, and promote and encourage the capitalists to better accept transformation in all aspects. He also hoped that the private-side executives of each factory, on the basis of beginning to accept socialist transformation, will pay more attention to accepting the leadership of public representatives and the supervision of the working masses, and consciously carry out self-transformation.
    At the meeting, Zhang Chengzong, Director of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, gave specific instructions on enterprise reform, transformation, and production work for the fourth quarter of each factory. Zhang Qi, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, called on the employees of each factory to celebrate joint ownership with practical actions to improve production; at the same time, they should be vigilant, strengthen mass production security work, and fight to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries.
    Representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Textile Trade Union, the Shanghai Cotton Textile Industry Association, the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, as well as private representatives, trade union chairmen, and model workers, also spoke at the meeting. As the meeting drew to a close, employees from each factory presented new achievements in production to the conference and put forward concrete guarantees for doing a good job in production, transforming enterprises, and transforming ideology in the future.

    上海市私营棉纺工业全部实行公私合营
    上海市二十三个私营棉纺工厂在九月二十八日举行了全业合营大会，庆祝全业实行公私合营。现在，上海的私营棉纺工业已经全部走上了国家资本主义的高级形式的道路。
    私营棉纺工业是上海市最大的一个行业，早在一九五零年到一九五一年间，就有九个私营棉纺厂实行了公私合营，以后陆续增加。今年上半年，二十三个厂的资本家先后向人民政府提出公私合营的申请，得到了上海市人民委员会的批准以后，就在八月间开始进行合营筹备工作。
    在全业合营大会上，大会执行主席、申新纺织印染股份有限公司总经理荣毅仁报告了全业合营的筹备经过。他说：二十三个工厂合营，是按照“裁、并、改、合”的原则来统筹处理的，使人力物力财力能够合理使用，充分发挥潜在力量，既有利于统筹兼顾，也有利于统一安排生产。在合营筹备过程中，公私双方进行了充分协商，使清产定股工作做到了公平合理、实事求是。在人事安排中，对私方实职人员全部作了妥善安排。
    大会上，中共上海市委统战工作部部长刘述周作了指示。他说明，全业合营比以厂为单位个别进行合营，在实施合营和今后生产安排以及行政管理等工作上有许多好处。他指出：企业合营以后，要完成改造企业和改造思想的任务，还是一个长期的艰苦复杂的斗争过程。全体职工应该在共产党、公方代表和工会的领导下，积极参加企业改革、改造工作，从各方面推动和鼓励资方人员更好地接受改造。他并希望各厂私方实职人员在开始接受社会主义改造的基础上，更加注意接受公方代表的领导和工人群众的监督，自觉地进行自我改造。
    会上，华东纺织管理局局长张承宗对各厂第四季度企业改革、改造和生产工作作了具体指示。上海市工会联合会副主席张祺号召各厂职工用搞好生产的实际行动来庆祝合营；同时要提高警惕，加强群众性的生产保卫工作，为肃清一切反革命分子而斗争。
    在会上发言的还有中国纺织工会上海市委员会、上海市棉纺织工业同业公会、中国民主建国会上海市分会、上海市工商业联合会等的代表以及私方代表、工会主席、劳动模范等多人。会议将结束时，各厂职工纷纷用生产上新的成就向大会献礼，并提出了今后搞好生产、改造企业和改造思想的具体保证。　（本报驻上海记者）
