Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The UN General Assembly Plenary Session continued its general political debate on the 3rd.

    At the morning session, the heads of the Ethiopian delegation, Walde; the Swedish delegation, Unden; the Pakistani delegation, Ali; the Lebanese delegation, Khouri; and the Argentinian delegation, Plate, spoke successively.

    At the afternoon session, Israeli representative Abba Eban and the head of the Syrian delegation, Shukairy, spoke. Subsequently, the General Assembly discussed the report submitted by the General Committee regarding the agenda for the tenth session. The General Assembly decided to include the West Irian question on the agenda by a vote of thirty-one to nineteen. The West Irian question has been submitted to the Political Committee for consideration. The General Assembly also unanimously approved the General Committee's recommendation to include the Soviet delegation's proposal—"Measures to Further Ease International Tensions and Develop International Cooperation"—on the agenda, and it has been submitted to the Political Committee for consideration.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: At the UN General Assembly plenary session on the morning of September 30, British Foreign Secretary Macmillan was the first to speak. He pointed out the obvious improvement in the recent international situation. He said that revising the UN Charter should be done in a spirit of harmony, and the time for revising the Charter may not have arrived yet. He advocated that all countries, "as long as it believes that the rights of the UN member states cannot be seriously opposed by anyone," should be admitted into the UN.

    When talking about the issue of the People's Republic of China's representation in the United Nations, Macmillan said, we believe that the time for considering this issue has not yet arrived. However, this issue must be resolved before comprehensive peaceful relations can be established in the Far East.

    Macmillan then spoke about his views on the issues to be discussed at the Four Foreign Ministers Geneva Conference. He said that one should hope to gradually understand each other's viewpoints better and hope to achieve some agreements reflecting the new spirit after having such mutual understanding.

    Macmillan said, I fully understand that after a war and the terrible damage caused by the Nazi army, Russia very much hopes to be protected by a buffer zone. I sympathetically understand their desire to prevent the sacred Russian territory from ever being ravaged by invaders again. This motive is understandable and worthy of respect. If this is the only difficulty, then I am sure that the Western countries can formulate a plan to satisfy this reasonable unease.

    We believe that we can formulate a plan that all people in the world believe can fully guarantee that a reunified Germany, and one that decides to join NATO (which it is likely to do), will not threaten the Soviet Union. This is the purpose of the various security proposals we are drafting. If there are shortcomings in our proposals, we will be happy to consider any revisions or additions. We are making proposals with a sincere purpose. If the Soviet government can accept such a security system in one form or another, then the knot of difficulty will be untied, and the spirit of Geneva will indeed be something real.

    Macmillan said that the overall tone of Molotov's speech at the General Assembly was exciting. In terms of wording and phrasing, it is in line with the new demeanor appropriate to the spirit of Geneva.

    The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, David, pointed out the importance of establishing a European collective security system in his speech. He said that Czechoslovakia is committed to promoting a peaceful solution to the German question, on the one hand, continuing to strengthen friendly relations with the German Democratic Republic, and on the other hand, also preparing to establish normal good-neighborly relations with the Federal Republic of Germany.

    David expressed the hope that the disarmament issue would be resolved. He condemned the use of procedural means to illegally deprive the People's Republic of China, the largest country in Asia, of its status in the United Nations. He opposed revising the UN Charter.

    联合国大会全体会议继续举行一般性辩论
    西伊里安问题经多数赞成已列入大会议程
    据新华社讯联合国大会全体会议三日继续进行一般性政治辩论。
    在上午会议上，埃塞俄比亚代表团团长沃尔德、瑞典代表团团长恩顿、巴基斯坦代表阿里、黎巴嫩代表扈利、阿根廷代表普拉泰先后发言。
    在下午会议上，以色列代表阿巴·伊班和叙利亚代表团团长舒凯里发言。接着，大会讨论了总务委员会提出的关于第十届会议议程的报告。大会以三十一票对十九票决定把西伊里安问题列入议程。西伊里安问题已经提交政治委员会审议。大会还一致通过了总务委员会提出的把苏联代表团提出的提案——“关于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的措施”——列入议程的建议，并且已经提交政治委员会审议。
    据新华社讯在联合国大会九月三十日上午全体会议上，英国外交大臣麦克米伦第一个发言。他指出最近国际局势的明显改善。他说，修改联合国宪章应当在和谐的精神中进行，修改宪章的时间可能还没有到来。他主张，所有的国家，“只要它认为联合国会员国的权利没有人能够加以认真的反对”，都应当被接纳进入联合国。
    麦克米伦在谈到中华人民共和国在联合国中的代表权问题时说，我们认为考虑这个问题的时间还没有到来。不过，这个问题必须先解决，才能在远东建立全面的和平关系。
    麦克米伦接着谈到他对于要在四国外交部长日内瓦会议上讨论的问题的看法。他说，应该希望彼此能逐步更加了解对方的观点，并且希望彼此在具备这种互相谅解之后，取得一些体现新精神的协议。
    麦克米伦说，我完全能够了解：俄国在经过了一场战争和遭到纳粹军队所造成的可怕损害以后，非常希望以一片缓冲地带来使它得到保护。我同情地理解他们要使神圣的俄国领土永远不再受到侵略者蹂躏的愿望。这种动机是可以理解和值得尊重的。如果这是唯一的困难，那末我确信西方国家能够拟订一个方案来满足这种合理的不安。
    我们相信，我们能够制定一种使得全世界人士都认为可以充分保证重新统一的和决定参加北大西洋公约组织（它很可能这样做）的德国不至威胁苏联的计划。这就是我们正在草拟中的各种安全建议的目的。如果我们的建议有不足之处，我们将乐于考虑任何修正或增添。我们是怀着一种真诚的目的来提出建议的。如果苏联政府能在这一种或另一种形式之下接受这样的安全体系，那末困难之结就会打开，日内瓦精神就会的确是某种现实的东西。
    麦克米伦说，莫洛托夫在大会上的发言的总的口气令人兴奋。就措辞和提法来看，它是符合同日内瓦精神相适应的新风度的。
  捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长戴维在发言中指出建立欧洲集体安全体系的重要性。他说，捷克斯洛伐克致力于促进和平解决德国问题，一方面继续加强同德意志民主共和国的友好关系，同时也准备同德意志联邦共和国建立正常的睦邻关系。
    戴维表示希望解决裁军问题。他谴责用程序上的手段来非法剥夺亚洲最大的一个国家中华人民共和国在联合国的地位。他反对修改联合国宪章。
