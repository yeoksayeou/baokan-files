An Investigation into the Agricultural Cooperation Movement in Three Counties of Hubei Province
Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Recently, I went to Echeng, Huanggang, and Xishui counties, mainly to understand the agricultural cooperation movement, to learn from the grassroots staff about their experiences in running agricultural cooperatives, to jointly examine the problems in the agricultural cooperatives, and to discuss how to lead the agricultural cooperation movement in the future. This was my first time going to the countryside to investigate the agricultural cooperation movement in the past six months. Although the time was only ten days, I benefited a lot. In particular, listening to the reports from three townships (Dushan Township and Linjiang Township in Echeng, and Wangcheng Township in Xishui) and several cooperatives, and seeing the production situation of several agricultural cooperatives, made me very excited. If we want to change the situation where our leadership lags behind the mass movement, and if we want to strengthen specific leadership over the agricultural cooperation movement, we must "share the fate and breathe the same air" with the staff of the counties, districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives, ask them for advice, and discuss with them. The situations in each county, township, and cooperative are not exactly the same. The actual experience of the cooperative movement is very rich. There are many outstanding people among the staff and activists of the counties, districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives. They not only have a high degree of socialist enthusiasm, but are also smart and talented. Our task is to encourage and support them to move forward, affirm and promote their advanced experiences, and lead and help the laggards to learn from the advanced. We should not use countless "rules and regulations" to restrain them, let alone pull them back. However, we made this right-leaning mistake in guiding the agricultural cooperation movement in the first half of this year. Many facts revealed from below have made us further recognize the seriousness of the right-leaning errors and the serious harm of bureaucracy and subjectivism in our leadership style.

I summarize the following based on what I saw and heard during this trip to the countryside, as well as some opinions I discussed with Comrade Jiang Yi, Secretary of the Huanggang Prefectural Committee, Comrade Ren Aisheng, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Committee, the county committee comrades of the three counties, Comrade Rao Xingli, the head of the Wangcheng Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xishui County, and some township staff:

I. Agricultural Production Cooperatives Do Increase Production Compared to Mutual Aid Teams and Individual Farmers

We arrived at Dushan Township in Echeng on the afternoon of September 9th. This is a cotton-producing area, and both agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have switched to growing Dai-character cotton. We saw a mutual aid team member and his son picking cotton in the field. Next to them was a plot of cotton from an agricultural cooperative, which was clearly denser and had more bolls than the cotton of the mutual aid team. In the middle of this large area of Dai-character cotton, there was a plot of local cotton grown by individual farmers. The plants were thin and weak, and the cotton bolls were few and small, and the yield was obviously much lower than that of the Dai-character cotton of the agricultural cooperative. It is said that this individual farmer once beat his own head and said, "Why didn't you grow Dai-character cotton?" On the morning of the 10th, we arrived at Linjiang Township in Echeng. This township has only one sixteen-household agricultural production cooperative, and the members of the cooperative have all increased their income. The cooperative's wheat yield this year averaged 190.5 jin per mu, and the high-yields reached 290 to 300 jin per mu. The wheat yield of the mutual aid teams averaged 145 jin per mu. Individual households (including two rich peasants) averaged 113 jin per mu. This summer, the agricultural cooperative sold a total of 8,460 jin of surplus grain. Poor peasant member Jin Baoqing sold 950 jin of surplus grain; while Jin Peiyu, a farmer outside the cooperative with the same population and land conditions, only sold 450 jin because of his lower income. The agricultural cooperative's cotton is expected to yield about 60 jin of ginned cotton per mu (high-yield cotton fields can yield about 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu). There is a wealthy middle peasant in this township named Jin Langqing, who is a skilled producer. He competed with the agricultural cooperative, saying that the yield of his cotton field would exceed that of a high-yield field of the agricultural cooperative. He once boasted, "My land has a strong base, and it will grow better than the cotton in your cooperative even without fertilizer," and secretly applied fertilizer at night. During a visit and comparison in the spring, his cotton seedlings grew taller and better, and he triumphantly said, "This is the cotton of individual households, not the cooperative's, don't get it wrong." Recently, this township organized another visit and comparison. The cotton in the high-yield field of the agricultural cooperative had thirty or forty bolls per plant, while Jin Langqing's cotton had only twenty-three bolls per plant. This is the most vivid and powerful education for farmers. People who doubted whether agricultural cooperatives could increase production have been convinced by the facts. Linjiang Township is now preparing to build twelve new cooperatives, and many poor farmers are asking to join. They wrote in their applications: Obey the leadership, work actively, treat the cooperative as home, and never withdraw.

The increase in production of agricultural cooperatives has attracted poor farmers to join. At the same time, it has driven mutual aid teams and individual farmers to actively increase production. Many mutual aid teams have put forward the slogan "Do a good job in production and strive to join the cooperative." This fully proves that agricultural cooperation is the main reliance for agricultural production increase. Doubting whether agricultural cooperatives can increase production, and even worrying that the cooperative movement will affect agricultural production, is unfounded.

Overcoming right-leaning conservative thinking, accelerating the development of cooperation, giving better play to the leading role of agricultural cooperatives, relying on agricultural cooperatives to drive mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and striving to overfulfill the agricultural production increase plan in the national Five-Year Plan, this is our determination. The agricultural cooperation movement and the agricultural production increase movement are consistent. The upsurge of the cooperation movement will inevitably promote the upsurge of the agricultural production increase movement. Just as poor farmers demand to participate in agricultural cooperatives in order to overcome difficulties, increase income, and improve their lives, there is no contradiction between the two.

How to better exert the leading role of agricultural cooperatives?

First, in addition to expanding the joint committee of mutual aid and cooperation in the township (representatives of individual farmers should be absorbed to participate), in townships where mutual aid and cooperation organizations are more developed, a branch of the mutual aid and cooperation committee should also be formed with a better agricultural cooperative as the core, and other cooperative leaders, mutual aid team leaders, and representatives of individual farmers should be absorbed to participate. This is convenient for timely exchange of production experience, mutual assistance (should pay attention to compliance with the principle of mutual benefit), overcoming difficulties, and developing production.

Second, production competitions should be organized between cooperatives and cooperatives, teams and teams, cooperatives and teams, and cooperatives and teams and individual households. Agricultural cooperatives should not be afraid to compete with wealthy middle peasants. It is understandable that the average unit area yield of agricultural cooperatives is not as high as that of some wealthy middle peasants in the first year. However, the high-yield fields of agricultural cooperatives can exceed those of wealthy middle peasants. The unit area yield of all the land of agricultural cooperatives will definitely catch up with and exceed that of the wealthy middle peasants in the township after one, two, or three years of effort. This is the current goal of every agricultural cooperative. Only when the production level of agricultural cooperatives catches up with and exceeds that of wealthy middle peasants can the lives of cooperative members be significantly improved and wealthy middle peasants be attracted to voluntarily join the cooperative.

Third, agricultural cooperatives should not only provide technical guidance to mutual aid teams and individual farmers, but also implement exchange of labor assistance with mutual aid teams and individual farmers when necessary. Necessary and possible assistance should be given to poor farmers who are lonely, widowed, old, and weak. This is beneficial to consolidating and developing agricultural cooperatives and developing agricultural production. The agricultural cooperative led by Rao Xingli has done a good job in this regard. For example, Cai Zhongheng is an old middle peasant with a lot of land and little labor. He signed up to join the cooperative led by Rao Xingli in the autumn of 1953, but then withdrew. He helped an agricultural cooperative production team with bookkeeping, and the agricultural cooperative used a water pump to help him rush to plant late autumn crops. Seeing that the cooperative was indeed better than being outside the cooperative, he joined the cooperative again in the autumn of 1954.

Fourth, on the basis of formulating agricultural cooperative plans based on townships, a township's agricultural production development plan should be formulated. Some advanced townships and advanced cooperatives should also formulate longer-term development plans for agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and diversified management (such as five years, ten years) so that the masses of farmers have a vision for development.

II. The Class Situation in Rural Areas and the Party's Class Policy

The central government and Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation have been conveyed at the three-level cadre meetings in these counties. After listening to Chairman Mao's instructions, the broad masses of rural staff, Party members, and activists brightened their eyes and raised their awareness. Many of them said that it was as if Chairman Mao had come to our township. Poor peasant activists said: Chairman Mao sits in Beijing and sees through the situation in our township. We know that Chairman Mao will never forget our poor peasants. He led us in the land reform and then led us to organize and take the socialist road, so that we can completely climb out of the poor pit and live a prosperous life. After studying the Party's class policy, many township branch secretaries and agricultural cooperative leaders reviewed their mistakes of excluding poor peasants, belittling poor peasants, reluctantly pulling wealthy peasants into the cooperative, and even relying on wealthy middle peasants to run the cooperative. They realized that poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants (i.e., poor and not yet wealthy farmers) actively support the socialist revolution. Many of them actively asked to join the cooperative. The poor peasants who had already joined the cooperative were able to work hard without complaining, stand guard, and protect the property of the cooperative. After the harvest, they saved money and repaid the loans from the bank or credit cooperative. However, the wealthy middle peasants, especially those with strong capitalist ideas, have been dissatisfied with the socialist transformation policy of agriculture since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale in 1953. For example, the wealthy middle peasant Guo Shaohuai joined the agricultural cooperative led by Rao Xingli in the autumn of 1952 in order to gain an advantage. He always wanted to earn more work points in the cooperative and did not do heavy work. After the implementation of the unified purchase in the autumn of 1953, he became very dissatisfied. He said, "I used to think the Communist Party was not bad, but now the more I look at it, the more it seems wrong." The reason why Guo Shaohuai does not withdraw from the cooperative now is because the "spontaneous" road has been blocked. Guo Shaohuai's income in the cooperative has increased compared to before, but he is still dissatisfied and wants to find various ways to be opportunistic. The agricultural cooperative is indeed much better for poor farmers who lack the means of production or labor. Among the seventy cooperative members in the agricultural cooperative led by Rao Xingli, except for six difficult households lacking labor, more than forty other poor peasant households have risen to the level of middle peasant living standards. For example, hired laborer Zhang Erlun, nicknamed "Eunuch Taoist" (honest and does not like to talk), has a family of five. Before joining the cooperative in the winter of 1952, he did not have his own cattle and farm tools. He had to help others farm first before he could farm his own land, so the crops did not grow well, and he would be short of food for several months every year. After joining the cooperative, he has surplus grain every year, built two new houses, attended winter school, and became a production model for the cooperative. He loves the cooperative as he loves his home and expresses his opinions at meetings. He is no longer an "Eunuch Taoist."

Rural staff used many vivid examples to illustrate the class situation in rural areas and the high tide of the cooperative movement. In some advanced townships, the number of households voluntarily signing up to join the cooperative has accounted for about 50% of the total number of households in the township. Like Dushan Township and Linjiang Township in Echeng, and Wangcheng Township and Shihe Township in Xishui, the number of households joining the cooperative this winter and next spring will reach more than 70% to 80% of the total number of households. In general townships (accounting for about 60% to 70% of the total number of townships), the number of households joining the cooperative this winter and next spring will also reach about 30% of the total number of households in the township. After analyzing the class situation and the different attitudes of farmers of all classes towards agricultural cooperatives, district and township staff realized that the main reasons why agricultural cooperatives are said to be difficult to run and have many problems, in addition to the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries or bad elements, are because "wealthy middle peasants have many opinions." Some wealthy middle peasants complain about withdrawing from the cooperative all year round, "avoiding heavy work," and when they see that poor peasants need supplies and loans, they also clamor for supplies and loans, and are unwilling to repay the loans even if they have money. Some wealthy middle peasants, when they become the head or deputy head of the cooperative, exclude poor peasants, conceal production, and resist unified purchase. Wang Chonggui (wealthy middle peasant), the deputy head of Shihe Township in Xishui, excluded five poor peasant households from withdrawing from the cooperative, and also let the production team carry the fertilizer accumulated by the cooperative to his own fields. He withdrew from the cooperative before transplanting rice seedlings. Liu Haidong (wealthy middle peasant), the township branch secretary and cooperative leader in a township in Huanggang County, said: "The superiority of agricultural cooperatives cannot be summarized. The more you summarize, the more they collapse. The cooperative catches fish, and each household only gets more than 30 yuan. One upper-middle peasant has his own boat and net and sells fish for more than 100 yuan." This Liu Haidong wants to run his own boat and net alone and get rich alone. Who can afford to buy a boat and net alone besides poor farmers through mutual aid and cooperation? It can be seen that in developing agricultural cooperatives, poor peasants and lower-middle peasants must first be absorbed into the cooperative, and activists among poor farmers (including lower-middle peasants) should form the backbone of the agricultural cooperative. Do not force wealthy middle peasants to join the cooperative, and do not allow wealthy middle peasants (except for individual Party members and activists of the upper-middle peasant component who truly have socialist consciousness) to control the leadership of the cooperative. At the same time, attention must be paid to the issue of class composition in the selection of rural staff and the choice of Party and League member development targets. Only in this way can a strong township branch be built that can lead the cooperative movement, can the policy of relying on poor peasants (including lower-middle peasants) to unite the middle peasants be smoothly realized, and can the rural regime be further consolidated and the victorious advance of the socialist transformation of agriculture be guaranteed.

In order to correctly implement the Party's class policy, the following issues must be noted:

First, we must correctly distinguish between poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and upper-middle peasants (do not re-divide classes). According to the survey of Linjiang Township in Echeng, the total number of households in the township is 688. Among them, in addition to 22 landlords, 32 rich peasants (omitted rich peasants and new rich peasants not included), and 16 small merchants and handicraftsmen, the total number of poor peasants and middle peasants is 618. At the time of the land reform, there were 434 original poor peasant households, and changes have taken place since the land reform. There are now 130 poor peasant households and 269 new lower-middle peasant households. The sum of the two is 399 households, accounting for 91.9% of the total number of original poor peasant households. The upper-middle peasants in the new middle peasants are 35 households, accounting for 8.1% of the total number of original poor peasant households (the population accounts for about 10%). At the time of the land reform, there were 184 original middle peasant households, which are now divided into 115 upper-middle peasant households and 69 lower-middle peasant households. The lower-middle peasants account for 37.5% of the total number of old middle peasants. The current poor peasants, new lower-middle peasants, plus old lower-middle peasants account for 74.1% of the total number of peasant households, accounting for more than 66% of the total number of households in the township. The surveys of Santaihe Township in Huanggang and Wangcheng Township in Xishui are roughly consistent with the above situation. We believe that these surveys are basically in line with the actual situation. For cooperative members, their components should be identified based on their economic status before joining the cooperative. The so-called economic status refers to both the possession of means of production (land, cattle, farm tools, investment) and living conditions. We cannot just look at their living conditions. For example, there is an old hired worker in Wangcheng Township in Xishui, who is more than forty years old and does not have a wife or children. After joining the cooperative, his income is sufficient (except for food and clothing, he has a surplus of 700 jin of rice). Before joining the cooperative, he had difficulties in production and life. Households like this should be counted as poor peasants.

Second, we must cultivate activists from among the poor and relatively poor peasants; develop Party members and League members from among these activists, and select and train cadres. Among the 1,029 cooperative staff recently trained by the Echeng County Party Committee, 326 are prepared to be cooperative leaders, including 247 poor peasants, 54 new lower-middle peasants, and 14 old lower-middle peasants. Among the deputy cooperative leaders, there are 264 poor peasants. Among the 325 accountants, 185 are poor peasants, 65 are new lower-middle peasants, and 62 are old lower-middle peasants. Through the Party consolidation meeting, the Xishui County Party Committee classified and ranked Party members according to their components and attitudes towards the cooperative (i.e., the degree of socialist consciousness). It found that among 1,363 Party members, 96 Party members were not actively taking the road of cooperation. Among 584 branch committee members, 28 were not actively taking the road of cooperation. After listening to Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation, 155 of the 205 township staff in Huanggang County actively supported it. Fifty people were not very active, held skeptical attitudes, or had resistance, of which 29 were of the new upper-middle peasant and old upper-middle peasant components. Those Party members who do not agree with the socialist revolution and still do not correct their mistakes after criticism and education should be expelled from the Party without any leniency. Those poor peasants who have been excluded and suffered blows should be publicly apologized to and their mistakes should be admitted; those poor peasants who have been "mobilized" (actually forced) to withdraw from the cooperative should be welcomed back; those poor farmers who voluntarily join the cooperative should all be absorbed (they cannot be excluded on the grounds that they have some minor shortcomings); those households with special difficulties due to lack of labor should be given special consideration in terms of work assignment, land remuneration, and government loans and relief funds, so that these difficult households (accounting for about 5% to 8% of the total rural population) can gradually get rid of the state of lack of food and clothing with the development of the agricultural cooperation movement and the rise in the living standards of the broad masses of farmers.

When publicizing the Party's class policy, a few Party members who have risen to the new upper-middle peasant component have a misunderstanding. They said: They have risen up but it's gone bad, and the Communist Party still likes the poor. This misunderstanding should be broken, and it should be made clear to them that the Communist Party does not like capitalism and does not like those exploiting elements who only care about getting rich and making others poor. The Party's policy is to restrict capitalism and to enable the broad masses of poor farmers to develop together and become rich together through the road of cooperation. Socialism is to eliminate exploitation, eliminate poverty, and enable the working people to live a prosperous life. Communist Party members are advanced fighters of the working class, and rural Party members must have the determination to rely wholeheartedly on poor peasants, unite with middle peasants, develop agricultural production, support national industrialization, and strive to realize socialism.

Third, the policy towards new and old upper-middle peasants. The current attitudes of poor farmers and wealthy farmers towards the socialist revolution are different in terms of being active and passive, firm and wavering. However, upper-middle peasants are also laboring farmers and allies of the socialist revolution. Their wavering and passive emotions can be gradually overcome under the leadership of the Communist Party and on the premise of the increasing development of socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperation. After their ideological awareness is improved, they can also take the socialist road together with poor farmers. Therefore, we must adhere to the policy of uniting with upper-middle peasants. For those who are temporarily unwilling to join the cooperative, do not force them to join; for those who have joined the cooperative and are willing to withdraw, allow them to withdraw, and tell them that they are welcome to return to the cooperative whenever they are willing to; those who do not want to withdraw can stay; those who truly voluntarily join can be absorbed. For some of the erroneous thoughts and behaviors of some upper-middle peasants (such as saying strange things, making trouble, and making some wrong remarks about unified purchase and sale and mutual aid and cooperation), appropriate criticism should be conducted within the peasants (it is wrong not to criticize). This criticism is for education and for unity. This criticism and education within the laboring people must be strictly distinguished from the struggle against unlawful landlords, rich peasants, or counter-revolutionaries and bad elements. Each township has found that there are indeed a few households that have been omitted as rich peasants or have newly risen to become rich peasants, and some of them have mixed into agricultural cooperatives and have engaged in sabotage activities. These people should be dealt with. However, the number of these omitted rich peasants or newly rising rich peasants is small. We must pay attention not to classify those upper-middle peasants who have exploitation, but the exploitation part does not indeed exceed 25% of their total income, or although it exceeds, it has not been continuous for three years, as rich peasants.

III. We Must Follow the Mass Line

The agricultural cooperation movement is a new socialist mass movement. We must let go of the masses, not use various "rules and regulations" to restrain the masses, and must cherish and support the enthusiasm and creativity of county, district, and township staff. We must not adopt the method of taking over or multiple accusations to restrict and strike their enthusiasm. The right-leaning errors of the Provincial Party Committee in guiding the cooperative movement in the past six months are reflected on the one hand in the insufficient estimation of the enthusiasm of poor farmers to participate in agricultural cooperatives, and the class policy is not implemented specifically and deeply enough; on the other hand, it is reflected in being "afraid of the tiger in front and the wolf behind," being bound hand and foot, and not daring to let go of the masses. This is a painful lesson that we should deeply remember. At the expanded meeting of the Xishui County Party Committee (with the participation of district party secretaries), I made a self-criticism to them on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee.

(1) Some comrades of the Provincial Party Committee criticized the Xishui County Party Committee this spring for having "impetuous and rash advance" emotions. Facts have proved that this criticism is inappropriate. Xishui County already has 867 agricultural cooperatives. Among them, 58 cooperatives have reduced production due to disasters, only 11 cooperatives have reduced production due to work not being done well, and the remaining 798 cooperatives have increased production by about 10% to 20% compared to mutual aid teams and individual households. The experience of Xishui County proves that the province could have run more cooperatives last winter and this spring, and it would have been possible to run them well if more were run.

(2) The Provincial Party Committee's policy of emphasizing the consolidation of newly built cooperatives and carrying out the spring plowing and production movement with all its strength this spring is correct, but problems have arisen in "resolutely stopping development." Because we wanted to stop development, some cooperatives had already been built, but they were not approved. For example, the cooperative led by Xiao Gongzi in Dushan Township, Echeng, has not been approved for half a year (Xiao Gongzi is a Communist Party member and has received two cooperation training sessions). It is not allowed to be called an agricultural cooperative, and it is not allowed to be called a senior group. But in fact, they persevered and did a good job, increasing production. There are many similar situations in other places in the so-called "spontaneous cooperatives." It is wrong not to help them carry out rectification and improvement, but to emphasize returning to the mutual aid team.

(3) The Provincial Party Committee's emphasis on changing large cooperatives into small ones without specific guidance is an important reason for causing the lower levels to mobilize cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperative. For example, the Baishishan Agricultural Cooperative in Wangcheng Township, Xishui, was established in the winter of 1953 and increased production in 1954. In the spring of 1955, because several wealthy middle peasants were making trouble to withdraw from the cooperative and causing disunity, the staff stationed in the cooperative forced the cooperative staff to mobilize 21 cooperative members to withdraw from the cooperative (accounting for half of the cooperative) with the order of "the County Party Committee's decision, obey the organization" (approved by the County Party Committee). Most of these households that withdrew from the cooperative are poor peasants, except for four wealthy middle peasants. For example, poor peasant Hu Liyuan was forced to withdraw from the cooperative in the name of "not actively attending meetings" because he had "night blindness" and it was inconvenient for him to attend meetings at night. Poor peasant Yang Laiqing's mother borrowed 3.6 yuan from the cooperative to buy piglets. The cooperative leader did not lend it to her, and she complained, "It's better to work alone," and was forced to withdraw from the cooperative; she cried several times after withdrawing.

(4) The Provincial Party Committee's several regulations on the specific policies of agricultural cooperatives based on the principle of mutual benefit are basically correct, but lack the necessary flexibility of "adapting to local conditions" and "adapting to the cooperative's conditions." This is because our policy of gradually increasing production investment and increasing the internal public property of the cooperative (including afforestation on barren mountains, collective land reclamation, etc.) in order to gradually transition to complete socialist cooperation on the condition of increasing production and increasing the income of cooperative members in semi-socialist agricultural cooperatives is not clear enough. We often pay too much attention to the immediate interests of the cooperative and the personal interests of the cooperative members, and neglect the long-term interests and collective interests of the cooperative. Because some specific policy regulations lack flexibility, the production development of some cooperatives has been somewhat limited. For example, the cooperative led by Rao Xingli planted a piece of pine forest on a barren mountain in 1952, which has now grown into a lush young forest. Later, due to the emphasis on cooperative members planting trees individually, afforestation on barren mountains was stopped. Therefore, there are still several barren mountains that have not been afforested. Comrade Rao Xingli said: If the agricultural cooperative is allowed to carry out collective afforestation, the barren mountains would have been eliminated long ago.

The above problems show that we must not only overcome right-leaning thinking, but also overcome the bureaucratic and commandist style of work and implement the Party's mass line.

In order to correctly implement the Party's mass line and meet the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, the following points should be noted:

First, the policy of "overall planning and strengthening leadership" instructed by the Central Committee and Chairman Mao must be resolutely implemented. We must not misunderstand letting go of the masses as being able to abandon leadership and let things go. We must make proper arrangements and organization for rural work in an all-round way and do a good job of various preparations before building a cooperative in a planned way.

Second, both the work of building a cooperative and the work of rectifying a cooperative must be carried out relying on the Party's township branch. Facts have proved that more than 90% of our rural Party members are good, and most of the rural staff are also good. Through this year's Party consolidation work, the awareness of Party members will be greatly improved. Some staff who have made mistakes in their thinking and work style have been educated and have expressed their determination to correct them. A few bad elements have been cleaned out. The leading backbone of the township branch has been adjusted. In this way, the leadership ability of the Party's township branch has been enhanced. It should be believed that relying on the township branch can do a good job of building a cooperative and rectifying a cooperative. The staff sent down from above should rely on the township branch and build a cooperative through the township branch, and should not take over. This is the key to implementing the mass line.

Third, adhere to the principle of voluntariness, not only do not force upper-middle peasants to join the cooperative, but also do not force poor peasants to join the cooperative. They must be organized in multiple batches according to the degree of awareness of the poor peasants. When carrying out the township's cooperation plan, the principle of voluntariness should be repeatedly explained to allow farmers to freely decide when to join the cooperative and which cooperative to join (mutual aid team members should voluntarily sign up to join the cooperative as households). Forcing orders is not allowed.

Fourth, the selection of cooperative staff such as cooperative leader, cooperative committee member, accountant, and production team leader must be fully discussed by the cooperative members before being democratically elected or approved by the cooperative members' congress. The method of designation cannot be adopted.

Fifth, the handling of various major issues in the cooperative must be approved by the cooperative members' congress. The cooperative's accounts should be announced to the cooperative members monthly and quarterly.

Sixth, in the movement to develop agricultural cooperatives, we must prevent counter-revolutionaries or other bad elements from organizing fake cooperatives, and we must promptly expose and crack down on the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries. The so-called "spontaneous cooperatives" run by the masses of farmers themselves should be investigated, and the masses should be helped to rectify and approve them. Those landlords, rich peasants, and other bad elements who have mixed into the cooperative should be cleared out after verifying the facts and obtaining the consent of the masses.

Seventh, the size of the cooperative should be specifically determined according to conditions such as residential conditions, personal relationships, and the strength of the backbone. It can be large or small, and should not be forced to be the same. It is a fact that newly built cooperatives with a dozen or twenty households are relatively easy to run well. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee's regulation that newly built cooperatives should not be too large is correct; but if the leading backbone is strong, large cooperatives with forty or fifty households or even sixty or seventy households can also be run well. Large cooperatives have great strength and are superior to small cooperatives. When expanding old cooperatives and preparing to build new cooperatives, each township should pay attention to this issue.

Eighth, the methods by which the county and district party committees lead agricultural cooperatives are, on the one hand, to teach the township branch secretary and branch committee members leadership methods; on the other hand, to use methods such as on-site meetings, cooperative members' representative meetings, visits and comparisons, and exchanges of experience to improve advanced cooperatives, drive general cooperatives, and help backward cooperatives. These two methods should be used to realize the Party's continuous leadership over the cooperative movement and correct the wrong methods of evenly distributing forces and having staff stationed in the cooperative replace the township branch.

    湖北省三个县农业合作化运动的调查
    中共湖北省委第一书记　王任重
    我最近到了鄂城、黄冈、浠水三个县，主要是了解农业合作化运动的情况，向下面工作人员学习办农业合作社的经验，同他们共同检查农业合作社中的问题，共同商议今后如何领导农业合作化运动。这是我半年来第一次下乡调查合作化运动的情况，时间虽然只有十天，但受益不少；特别是听了三个乡（鄂城杜山乡、临江乡、浠水望城乡）和几个合作社的报告，看了几个农业合作社的生产情况，使我非常兴奋。我们要想改变领导落后于群众运动的情况，要想加强对农业合作化运动的具体领导，就必须同县、区、乡、农业合作社的工作人员“共命运，同呼吸”，向他们请教，同他们商议。各县、各乡、各社的情况都不是完全相同的。合作化运动的实际经验是很丰富的。县、区、乡、农业合作社的工作人员和积极分子中，有许多优秀人物。他们不仅具有高度的社会主义积极性，而且是聪明的，有才能的。我们的任务是鼓励和支持他们前进，肯定和推广他们的先进经验，领导和帮助落后者向先进者看齐，不应该用无数的“清规戒律”去束缚他们的手脚，更不应该拉着他们后退。可是我们今年上半年在指导农业合作化运动上，就犯了这种右倾错误。从下边揭发出来的许多事实，使我们进一步认识到右倾错误的严重性，进一步认识到我们领导作风上官僚主义和主观主义的严重危害。
    我把这次下乡所看到的和听到的情况，以及我同黄冈地委书记姜一同志、省委农村工作部副部长任爱生同志、三个县的县委同志、浠水县望城乡农业生产合作社长饶兴礼同志以及一些乡的工作人员所商议过的一些意见，综述如下：
    一、农业生产合作社的确比互助组和单干农民增了产
    我们在九月九日下午到了鄂城杜山乡。这里是产棉区，农业生产合作社和互助组都改种了岱字棉。我们看到了一个互助组的组员父子二人正在地里拾棉花。他们旁边有一块农业合作社的棉花，显然比互助组的棉花株密桃多。在这大片岱字棉中间，有一块单干农民种的本地棉，株叶细弱，棉桃少而小，比农业合作社的岱字棉的产量显然要低得多。据说这户单干农民曾经自己打自己的脑袋说：“你为什么不种岱字棉。”十日上午我们到了鄂城临江乡。这个乡只有一个十六户的农业生产合作社，社员户户都增加了收入。社里今年的小麦每亩平均收一百九十点五斤，产量高的每亩达二百九十到三百斤。互助组的小麦每亩平均收一百四十五斤。单干户（内有两户富农）每亩平均收一百一十三斤。今年夏季农业合作社共卖余粮八千四百六十斤。贫农社员金宝庆卖出余粮九百五十斤；而人口、田地条件和他相同的社外农民金佩玉因收入少只卖出四百五十斤。农业合作社棉花预计每亩可收皮棉六十斤左右（丰产棉田每亩可收皮棉一百斤左右）。这个乡有个富裕中农金朗清，是个生产能手，同农业合作社比赛，说他的棉田产量要胜过农业合作社的一块丰产田。他曾吹嘘说“我的地底子壮，不上粪也比你们社里的棉花长得好”，并在晚上偷偷施肥。春季参观评比时，他的棉苗长得较高较好，他洋洋自得地说：“这是单干户的棉花，不是合作社的，你们可莫搞错了。”最近这个乡又组织了一次参观评比。农业合作社丰产田的棉花每株有三、四十个桃子，而金朗清的棉花每株只有二十三个桃子。这是对农民最生动最有力的教育。怀疑农业合作社能否增产的人，被事实说服了。临江乡现在正在筹建十二个新社，许多贫苦农民都要求入社。他们在申请书上写着：服从领导，积极劳动，以社为家，永不退社。
    农业合作社的增产，吸引贫苦农民纷纷入社；同时带动互助组、单干农民积极增加生产。有许多互助组提出了“搞好生产，争取入社”的口号。这就充分证明了农业合作化是农业增产的主要依靠。怀疑农业合作社能否增产，甚至忧虑合作化运动会影响农业生产，是毫无根据的。
    克服右倾保守思想加速合作化的发展，更好地发挥农业合作社的带头作用，依靠农业合作社去带动互助组和单干农民，为超额完成国家五年计划中的农业增产计划而努力，这是我们的决心。农业合作化运动和农业增产运动是一致的，合作化运动的高涨，必然推动农业增产运动的高涨。这正如贫苦农民要求参加农业合作社是为了克服困难，增加收入，改善生活一样，二者是没有矛盾的。
    怎样更好地发挥农业合作社的带头作用呢？
    第一、除了扩大乡的互助合作联合委员会之外（应吸收单干农民中的代表人物参加），在互助合作组织较为发达的乡，还应根据居住条件以一个较好的农业合作社为核心，吸收其他社长、互助组长、单干农民的代表人物参加，组成互助合作委员会分会。这样才便于及时交流生产经验，便于互相协助（应注意遵守互利原则），克服困难，发展生产。
    第二、应该组织社同社、组同组、社同组、社组同单干户的生产竞赛。农业合作社不应害怕同富裕中农竞赛，农业合作社的平均单位面积产量，头一年不如某些富裕中农高，是可以理解的。但是农业合作社的丰产田，是能够超过富裕中农的。农业合作社的全部田地的单位面积产量，在经过一年、两年、三年的努力之后，是一定可以赶上并超过本乡富裕中农的，这是当前每个农业合作社的努力目标。只有农业合作社的生产水平赶上并超过了富裕中农，社员的生活才能得到较大的改善，才能吸引富裕中农自愿入社。
    第三、农业合作社不仅要在技术上指导互助组和单干农民，而且在必要时应该同互助组、单干农民实行换工互助。对于孤寡老弱的贫困农民，应给予必要的和可能的扶助。这对于巩固和发展农业合作社、发展农业生产都是有好处的。饶兴礼领导的农业合作社在这方面做得比较好。如蔡仲恒是一田地多、劳力少的老中农，一九五三年秋报名入社，后又退社，他帮助农业合作社一个生产队记账，农业合作社用抽水机帮助他抢种晚秋，他眼看社里确实比社外好，一九五四年秋，就又入了社。
    第四、在以乡为单位制定农业合作社的规划的基础上，应制定乡的农业生产发展计划，有些先进乡和先进社还应该制定较为长期的农、林、畜牧业多种经营的发展计划（如五年、十年），使农民群众有个发展的远景。
    二、农村的阶级情况和党的阶级政策
    中央和毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示，这几个县都在三级干部会上作了传达。听了毛主席的指示，广大的乡村工作人员、党员和积极分子，擦亮了眼睛，提高了觉悟。他们许多人都说等于毛主席到咱们乡来了一次。贫农积极分子说：毛主席坐在北京，把咱们乡的情况都看透了。我们知道毛主席绝对不会忘掉咱们贫农的。他领导咱们土改，又领导咱们组织起来，走社会主义的道路，使咱们从穷坑里完全爬出来过富裕生活。许多乡支部书记、农业合作社长学习了党的阶级政策以后，检讨了排斥贫农、轻视贫农和勉强拉富裕农民入社、甚至依靠富裕中农办社的错误，认识到贫农和新老下中农（即贫苦的和还不富裕的农民）对社会主义革命事业是积极拥护的。他们当中许多人积极要求参加社。已经入社的贫农，都能够任劳任怨，不闹纠纷，站岗放哨，保护社的财产；丰收之后，都省吃俭用，偿还银行或信用社的欠款。而富裕中农，特别是那些资本主义思想浓厚的分子，从一九五三年实行统购统销以来，就对农业的社会主义改造政策抵触不满。如富裕中农郭少怀，一九五二年秋为了讨便宜，参加了饶兴礼领导的农业合作社。在社内总想多赚工分，不干重活。到一九五三年秋实行统购之后，则大为不满。他说：“原来看共产党还不错，现在越看越不像话。”现在郭少怀所以不退社，是因为“自发”的路被堵塞住了。郭少怀在社里的收入，是比以前增加的，但他还是不满，想各种办法投机取巧。农业合作社对于缺乏生产资料或缺乏劳动力的贫苦农民，好处确实是大些。饶兴礼领导的农业合作社七十户社员中，除了六户缺乏劳动力的困难户以外，其他四十多户贫农都上升到中农生活水平了。如雇农张二伦，外号“奄道士”（人老实不爱说话），家有五口人。他一九五二年冬季入社以前，自己没有耕牛农具，得先帮别人种田，然后才能种自己的，因而庄稼长不好，每年要缺几个月的粮。入社之后每年有余粮，盖了两间新房，上了冬学，成了社的生产模范。他爱社如爱家，开会发表意见，再不是“奄道士”了。
    乡村工作人员用许多活生生的例子，说明了农村阶级情况和合作化运动的高潮。一部分先进乡，自愿报名入社的农户已占全乡总户数的百分之五十左右。像鄂城的杜山乡、临江乡，浠水的望城乡、石河乡，今冬明春入社农户将达总户数的百分之七十到八十以上。一般乡（约占全部乡数的百分之六十到七十）今冬明春入社农户也将达全乡总户数的百分之三十左右。区乡工作人员在分析了阶级情况和各阶层农民对农业合作社的不同态度之后，认识到所谓农业合作社难办，农业合作社问题多的主要原因，除了反革命分子或坏分子的破坏以外，就是因为“富裕中农的意见多”。有些富裕中农，一年到头闹退社，干活“避重就轻”，看到贫农要供应、要贷款，他也吵供应、吵贷款，欠了贷款有钱也不愿还。有的富裕中农，当了社长或副社长，就排斥贫农，隐瞒产量，抵抗统购。浠水石河乡有一个副社长王崇贵（富裕中农），把五户贫农排斥退社，又把社里积的肥，让生产队担到自己的田里，插秧以前，自己就退了社。黄冈县一个乡支部书记兼社长刘海东（富裕中农）说：“农业合作社优越性总结不得，越总结越垮，合作社打鱼，每户只分到三十多元钱，有一户上中农，自己一条船，一张网，打鱼卖了一百多元。”这个刘海东就是想自己单独搞一条船，一张网，单独发财。而所有的贫苦农民，除了互助合作之外，谁能单独买得起什么船什么网呢？可见在发展农业合作社时必须首先吸收贫农和下中农入社，使贫困农民（包括下中农）中的积极分子形成农业合作社的骨干；不要勉强拉富裕中农入社，不要使富裕中农（个别真正具有社会主义觉悟的上中农成份的党团员或积极分子除外）掌握社的领导权。同时乡村工作人员的挑选，党员团员发展对象的选择，都必须注意成份问题。只有这样才能建设起一个能够领导合作化运动的强有力的乡支部，才能顺利地实现依靠贫农（包括下中农）团结中农的政策，才能进一步巩固乡村政权，保证农业的社会主义改造事业的胜利前进。
    为了正确地贯彻执行党的阶级政策，必须注意以下几个问题：
    第一、要正确区分贫农、下中农和上中农（不要重新划分阶级）。鄂城临江乡的调查，全乡总户数六百八十八户，其中除地主二十二户、富农三十二户（漏划富农和新富农未计入）小商贩手工业者十六户以外，贫农中农合计六百一十八户。土地改革时原有贫农四百三十四户，土地改革后发生了变化。现有贫农一百三十户。新下中农二百六十九户。二者合计为三百九十九户，占原有贫农总户数的百分之九十一点九。新中农中间的上中农三十五户，占原有贫农总户数百分之八点一（人口约占百分之十左右）。土地改革时原有中农一百八十四户，现在分为上中农一百一十五户，下中农六十九户，下中农占老中农总户数的百分之三十七点五。现有贫农、新下中农，加上老下中农共计占农户总数的百分之七十四点一，占全乡总户数的百分之六十六强。黄冈三台河乡和浠水望城乡的调查，同上述情况大体一致。我们认为这些调查是基本上符合实际情况的。对社员，应根据入社前的经济地位来辨别其成份。所谓经济地位，是指生产资料的占有（田地、耕牛、农具、投资）和生活状况两方面而言。不能仅仅看其生活状况。如浠水望城乡有一个老雇工，四十多岁，没有老婆孩子，入社后收入有敷余（除吃穿外，余七百斤米）；入社前，生产生活都有困难。像这样的户，应算做贫农。
    第二、必须从贫苦和比较贫苦的农民当中，培养积极分子；从这些积极分子当中，发展党员、团员，挑选和培养干部。鄂城县委最近训练的一千零二十九个社工作人员中，有三百二十六个是准备当社长的，其中有二百四十七个是贫农，五十四个新下中农，十四个老下中农。副社长中有二百六十四个贫农。三百二十五个会计中，贫农有一百八十五人，新下中农六十五人，老下中农六十二人。浠水县委通过整党会议，根据党员成份和对社的态度（即社会主义觉悟程度）进行分类排队，发现
  一千三百六十三个党员中，有九十六个党员不积极走合作化道路。五百八十四个支部委员中，有二十八个不积极走合作化的道路。黄冈县二百零五个乡的工作人员，听了毛主席关于农业合作化的指示，积极拥护的一百五十五人。不大积极，抱怀疑态度或有抵触情绪的五十人，其中二十九人的成份是新上中农和老上中农。对那些不赞成社会主义革命的党员，经过批评教育仍不改正的，应清除出党，决不姑息。对那些被排斥、受过打击的贫农，应该公开向他们道歉，承认错误；对于被“动员”（实际是强迫）退社的贫农，一律要欢迎他们回来；对于自愿入社的贫苦农民一律要吸收（不能借口他们有些什么小缺点再加以排斥）；对于那些缺乏劳力的特别困难户，应从派工、土地报酬和政府贷款、救济款等方面加以特别照顾，使这些困难户（约占农村总人口的百分之五到八）能够随着农业合作化运动的发展和广大农民生活的上升，逐渐摆脱缺衣缺食的状况。
    在宣传党的阶级政策时，有少数上升为新上中农成份的党员发生了一种误解，他们说：自己上升升坏了，共产党还是喜欢穷人。应该打破这种误解，应该向他们说清楚：共产党是不喜欢资本主义，不喜欢那种只顾自己发财使旁人受穷的剥削分子。党的政策是限制资本主义，是要通过合作化的道路，使广大贫苦农民共同发展，共同富裕。社会主义就是要消灭剥削，消灭贫困，使劳动人民过富裕生活。共产党员是工人阶级的先进战士，农村党员必须具有全心全意依靠贫农、团结中农、发展农业生产、支援国家工业化，为实现社会主义而奋斗的决心。
    第三、对待新、老上中农的政策。贫苦农民和富裕农民，当前对于社会主义革命的态度是有积极和消极、坚定和动摇的区别的。但上中农也是劳动农民，是社会主义革命的同盟军。他们的动摇消极情绪，是可以在共产党的领导下，在社会主义工业化和农业合作化日益发展的前提下，逐步得到克服的。在他们的思想觉悟提高以后，他们也是可以同贫困农民一起走社会主义道路的。因此，对待上中农必须坚持团结的政策。对于他们当中暂时不愿入社的人，不要勉强他们入社；对于已入社而愿意退出的，允许退出，并且应告诉他们什么时候愿意回到社里来还是欢迎的；对于不愿退社的可以留下；真正自愿入社的可以吸收。对于某些上中农的错误思想和行为（如说怪话，闹情绪，对统购统销、互助合作的某些错误言论），应该在农民内部进行适当的批评（不批评是错误的）。这种批评是为了教育，为了团结，必须把这种劳动人民内部的批评教育和对不法地主、富农或反革命分子、坏分子的斗争严格区别开来。各个乡都发现确有几户漏划富农或新上升的富农，他们有的已混入农业合作社并有破坏活动。对这些人应该加以处理。但这种漏划富农或新上升富农为数不多，必须注意不要把那些虽有剥削，但剥削部分确实不超过其总收入的百分之二十五或虽超过但未连续三年的上中农划为富农。
    三、必须走群众路线
    农业合作化运动，是新的社会主义群众运动，必须放手发动群众，不能用各种“清规戒律”去束缚群众的手足，必须爱护和支持县、区、乡工作人员的积极性和创造性，不能采取包办代替或多种责难去限制和打击他们的积极性。省委这半年来，在指导合作化运动上的右倾错误，一方面表现在对贫苦农民参加农业合作社的积极性估计不足，阶级政策贯彻执行得不够具体深入；另一方面表现在“前怕虎、后怕狼”，束手束脚，不敢放手发动群众。这是我们应该深刻记取的沉痛教训。这次在浠水县委扩大会议上（有区委书记参加），我代表省委向他们进行了自我批评。
    （一）省委有几个同志，今春曾经批评过浠水县委有“急躁冒进”情绪。事实证明这种批评是不妥当的。浠水县已有农业合作社八百六十七个。其中因灾减产者五十八个社，因工作未做好减产者只有十一个社，其余七百九十八个社都比互助组、单干户增产百分之十到百分之二十左右。浠水县的经验证明，全省在去冬今春是可以办更多的社的，办得更多一些也是可以办好的。
    （二）今年春季省委强调巩固新建社，全力开展春耕生产运动的方针是正确的，但在“坚决停止发展”上出了问题。因为要停止发展，有的社已经建起来了，也不批准。如鄂城杜山乡萧功梓领导的社，半年来未获批准（萧功梓是共产党员，受过两次合作训练），不准叫农业合作社，又不准叫高级组。可是事实上他们坚持下来了，办得很好，增加了生产。其他各地所谓“自发社”，也有不少类似情况。对于真正的自发社，不去帮助他们进行整顿提高，而强调退回到互助组，这种做法是错误的。
    （三）省委对农业合作社强调以大改小，指导又不具体，这是造成下边动员社员退社的一个重要原因。如浠水望城乡白石山农业合作社是一九五三年冬季建立的，一九五四年增了产。一九五五年春，因几户富裕中农闹退社，闹不团结，驻社工作人员便以“县委决定、服从组织”（经县委同意的）的命令，强迫社的工作人员动员二十一户社员退了社（占全社一半）。这些退社户除四户富裕中农外，多是贫苦农民。如贫农胡立元因“夜盲眼”不便夜晚开会，用“开会不积极”的名义强迫他退社。贫农杨来青的母亲，因买小猪向社里借三元六角钱，社长不借支，说过一句“不如单干”的牢骚话，就被迫退社；退社后曾哭过几次。
    （四）省委根据互利原则，对农业合作社具体政策所作的若干规定，基本上是正确的，但缺乏“因地制宜”“因社制宜”的必要的灵活性。这是由于我们对于半社会主义性质的农业合作社，要在增加生产，增加社员收入的条件下，逐步增加生产投资，增加社内公共财产（包括荒山造林、集体开荒等），以便逐步向完全社会主义合作化过渡的方针不够明确，往往过多地注重社的眼前利益和社员个人利益，而忽视社的长远利益和集体利益。因为一些具体政策的规定缺乏灵活性，使有些社的生产发展受到了某些限制。如饶兴礼领导的社，一九五二年在荒山上种了一片松林，现已长成茂盛的幼林了。后因强调社员个人植树，荒山造林便停顿下来。因而至今还有几片荒山没有造林。饶兴礼同志说：如让农业合作社集体造林，荒山早已消灭了。
    上述这些问题，说明我们不仅要克服右倾思想，而且要克服官僚主义、命令主义的工作作风，贯彻党的群众路线。
    为了正确执行党的群众路线，迎接农业合作化运动的高潮，应该注意下列几点：
    第一、中央和毛主席所指示的“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，必须坚决贯彻。不能把放手发动群众误解为是可以放弃领导，放任自流，必须对农村工作全面进行妥善安排和组织，并有计划地做好建社以前的各项准备工作。
    第二、建社工作和整社工作，都要依靠党的乡支部去进行。事实证明，我们农村党员百分之九十几是好的，乡村工作人员绝大部分也是好的。经过今年的整党工作，党员的觉悟将大为提高。有些思想作风上有错误的工作人员受到了教育，已表示决心改正。少数坏分子已被清洗出去。乡支部的领导骨干已进行了调整。这样，党的乡支部的领导能力就增强了。应当相信，依靠乡支部是可以做好建社和整社工作的。上面派下去的工作人员，应该依靠乡支部、经过乡支部去办社，不应包办代替。这是贯彻群众路线的关键所在。
    第三、坚持自愿原则，不仅不要勉强拉上中农入社，也不要勉强拉贫苦农民入社。必须根据贫苦农民的觉悟程度，分做多批把他们组织起来。在进行乡的合作化规划时，应该反复说明自愿原则，让农民自由决定何时入社，入哪个社（互助组员应以户为单位自愿报名入社）。不准强迫命令。
    第四、挑选社的工作人员如社长、社委、会计、生产队长都必须经过社员充分酝酿之后由社员大会民主选举或通过，不能采取指定办法。
    第五、社内各项重大问题的处理，都必须经过社员大会通过。社的账目应按月按季向社员公布。
    第六、在发展农业合作社的运动中，必须防止反革命分子或其他坏分子组织假社，并应及时揭发打击反革命分子的破坏活动。对于农民群众自己办的所谓“自发社”应该加以调查，帮助群众进行整顿，加以批准。对于混入社的地主富农和其他坏分子，应在查明属实取得群众同意的条件下加以清除。
    第七、关于社的大小问题，应该根据居住条件，人事关系、骨干强弱等条件具体决定，可大可小，不能强求一律。十几户、二十几户的新建社，比较容易办好是事实，因而省委关于新建社不可太大的规定是正确的；但如领导骨干较强，四、五十户甚至六、七十户的大社也是可以办好的。社大力量大，优越性超过小社，各乡在扩大老社筹建新社时，应注意这个问题。
    第八、各县、区党委领导农业合作社的方法，一方面是要教会支部书记、支部委员领导方法；一方面还要运用现场、会议、社员代表会议、参观评比、交流经验等方法提高先进社，带动一般社，帮助落后社。要用这两种方法，来实现党对合作化运动经常不断的领导，纠正那种平均使用力量和驻社工作人员代替支部的错误方法。
