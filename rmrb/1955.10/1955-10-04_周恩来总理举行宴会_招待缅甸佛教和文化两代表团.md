Xinhua News Agency, October 3rd – Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, hosted a banquet on the evening of the 3rd in honor of the Burmese Buddhist Delegation headed by U Tun Maung and the Burmese Cultural Delegation headed by U Win.

At the banquet, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, extended a warm welcome to the friends who had come from afar.

Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Historically, the relationship between China and Burma has been friendly. Our two peoples have long had connections in culture, economy, and religion.  Since the successive establishment of the Union of Burma and the People's Republic of China, the amicable relations between our two countries have seen new developments. Our two governments and peoples are playing an increasingly important role in the common cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. Our cooperation in culture, economy, and other aspects is also gradually expanding. This friendly and cooperative relationship undoubtedly helps us to overcome our respective difficulties and build our respective countries. This year, the Chinese Cultural Delegation and Buddhist Delegation were invited to visit the Union of Burma, and this visit to China by the Burmese Buddhist Delegation and the Burmese Cultural Delegation is a concrete manifestation of this friendly and cooperative relationship."

Premier Zhou Enlai continued: "The mission of the Burmese Buddhist Delegation's visit to China this time is to welcome the Buddha's tooth to Burma for the Burmese people to pay homage to. The Chinese government and the Chinese people are very willing to help our Burmese friends accomplish the mission of welcoming the Buddha's tooth to Burma. The visit of the Burmese Cultural Delegation to China will enable our broad audience to have the opportunity to appreciate the beautiful performances of Burmese artists. I believe that Chinese cultural circles will be able to learn a lot from Burmese art, which is rich in national characteristics."

Subsequently, the head of the Burmese Buddhist Delegation, U Tun Maung, and the head of the Burmese Cultural Delegation, U Win, delivered speeches successively. In his speech, U Tun Maung said that the friendship between China and Burma has a long history, and now it has been unprecedentedly developed. He said that Burma was one of the first Asian countries to recognize the People's Republic of China; she has continuously supported the restoration of the People's Republic of China's seat in the United Nations; the Prime Ministers of China and Burma have paid mutual visits and issued a joint statement on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; at the Bandung Conference, the Prime Ministers of the two countries cooperated for peace in Asia and the world; and recently, Burma also sent three friendship delegations of about one hundred representatives to visit China and participate in China's National Day celebrations. These are all clear proof of the friendship between China and Burma.

U Tun Maung finally expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Chinese government and people for the warm, brotherly hospitality that the delegation received during this visit to welcome the Buddha's tooth.

In his speech, U Win said that the visit of the Chinese Cultural Delegation and the Chinese Buddhist Delegation to Burma enabled the Burmese people to understand China's art and freedom of religious belief. This visit to China by the Burmese delegation will also help promote mutual understanding between the people of China and Burma. He said that after arriving in China, he visited some temples and saw that the Chinese government gave a lot of help to the temples, which made him feel that there is freedom of religious belief in China. He also said that the delegation felt very cordial in China, as if they were in the homes of brothers and friends. He said that after attending the National Day celebrations, he was even more convinced that the Chinese government and people love peace.

Attending the banquet tonight were Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yi and Ulanhu, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen, Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Acting Minister of Culture Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Director of the Bureau of Religious Affairs of the State Council He Chengxiang, President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association Zheng Zhenduo, Vice President of the Chinese Buddhist Association Zhao Puchu, as well as heads of relevant departments of the Central People's Government, and people from religious and literary and art circles in the capital.

After the banquet, the Chinese Cultural Delegation, which had previously visited Burma, and the Burmese Cultural Delegation performed Burmese and Chinese song and dance programs. (Photo attached)

    新华社三日讯　中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来在三日晚举行宴会，招待以吴登貌为首的缅甸联邦佛教代表团和以吴温为首的缅甸联邦文化代表团。
    周恩来总理在宴会上代表中国政府和中国人民，对远道来访的朋友们表示热烈的欢迎。
    周恩来总理说：“在历史上，中国同缅甸的关系是友好的。我们两国人民之间在文化、经济、宗教各方面早就有了联系。自从缅甸联邦和中华人民共和国相继成立以后，我们两国之间的友好关系有了新的发展。我们两国政府和人民在共同保卫亚洲和世界的和平的事业中，正在发挥着日益重大的作用。我们两国在文化、经济各方面的合作也在逐渐扩大。这种友好合作关系无疑地是有助于我们克服各自的困难和建设各自的国家的。今年，中国文化代表团和佛教代表团应邀访问缅甸联邦和这次缅甸联邦佛教代表团和缅甸联邦文化代表团应邀来中国访问，就是这种友好合作关系的具体表现。”
    周恩来总理接着说：“缅甸联邦佛教代表团这次到中国来的使命是迎奉佛牙到缅甸去，供缅甸人民瞻仰，中国政府和中国人民十分愿意帮助我们的缅甸朋友完成迎奉佛牙到缅甸去的使命。缅甸联邦文化代表团的访问中国，将使我国广大观众能够有机会欣赏缅甸艺术家们的优美表演。我相信中国文化界将可以从富有民族特征的缅甸艺术中学到很多东西。”
    接着，缅甸联邦佛教代表团团长吴登貌和缅甸联邦文化代表团团长吴温相继致词。吴登貌在致词中说，中缅友谊有了长久的历史，现在它又得到了空前的发展。他说，缅甸是最先承认中华人民共和国的亚洲国家之一；她不断支持中华人民共和国恢复在联合国的地位；中缅两国总理作了互相访问，并发表了五项原则的联合声明；在万隆会议上，两国总理为亚洲和世界和平进行了合作；最近缅甸并有三个友好代表团约一百位代表来中国访问，并参加了中国的国庆典礼。这些都是显示中缅两国友谊的明证。
    吴登貌最后对代表团这次前来迎奉佛牙所受到的中国政府和人民的亲兄弟般的热情招待，表示衷心感谢。
    吴温在致词中说，中国文化代表团和中国佛教代表团访问了缅甸，使缅甸人民对中国的艺术和宗教信仰自由有了了解。这次缅甸的代表团来到中国访问，同样有助于中缅两国人民的相互了解。他说，他到中国之后，参观了一些寺院，看到中国政府给予寺院以许多的帮助，使他感到中国信教是自由的。他又说，代表团在中国好像在兄弟的和朋友的家里一样，感到非常亲切。他谈到参加中国国庆节观礼以后，更加相信中国政府和人民是热爱和平的。
    出席今晚宴会作陪的，有国务院副总理陈毅、乌兰夫，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、北京市市长彭真，国务院秘书长习仲勋，文化部代理部长钱俊瑞，外交部副部长章汉夫，国务院宗教事务局局长何成湘，中缅友好协会会长郑振铎，中国佛教协会副会长赵朴初，以及中央人民政府有关各部门负责人，首都宗教、文艺界人士。
