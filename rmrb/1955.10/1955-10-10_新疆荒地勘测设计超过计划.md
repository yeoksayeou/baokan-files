Xinjiang's wasteland survey and farm survey and design work, as of mid-September, based on the results of three survey teams of the Wasteland Survey and Design Bureau in the Junggar Basin, Yanqi and Turpan Basins, they completed the survey of more than 9 million mu of wasteland, exceeding this year's wasteland survey plan by 29%; surveyed more than 1,826,000 mu of wasteland, completing 83% of this year's survey plan; and completed all the design of 500,000 mu of state-owned farms and the preliminary design of 300,000 mu in the Manas, Urumqi, Liugou, and Yanqi reclamation areas.

While conducting farm survey and design, the Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region dispatched more than 180 standard tractors and 20 bulldozers for land leveling and reclamation, and at the same time carried out artificial alkali washing. A detachment of a certain unit can reclaim 10 mu of land per hour of operation of each machine. Ma Zhaolong and Peng Youyu, who drove two Stalin 80-type locomotives, exceeded the quota by more than 1,300 mu in completing the reclamation of 5,345 mu, saving more than 2,400 kilograms of fuel. By mid-September, the troops had reclaimed more than 190,000 mu, and a portion of autumn-sown crops had been planted on the newly reclaimed wasteland according to a scientific crop rotation plan. At present, the land reclamation work is in full swing, and it is estimated that more than 640,000 mu of land reclamation tasks can be completed before the freeze.

    新疆荒地勘测设计超过计划
    新疆省荒地调查及农场勘测设计工作，截至九月中旬，据荒地勘查设计局所属三个勘测队在准噶尔盆地、焉耆及吐鲁蕃盆地上进行的结果来说，他们完成了九百多万亩的荒地调查，超过今年调查荒地计划百分之二十九；勘测了荒地一百八十二万六千余亩，完成今年勘测计划百分之八十三；并在玛纳斯、乌鲁木齐、柳沟，焉耆等垦区完成五十万亩国营农场的全部设计和三十万亩的初步设计。
    在进行农场勘测设计的同时，新疆军区农业生产建设部队出动了拖拉机一百八十多标准台、推土机二十台进行整地垦荒，并同时进行人工洗碱。某部支队平均每台机车工作一小时能垦荒十亩。某部马兆龙和彭友玉驾驶的两台斯大林八十型机车，在完成垦荒五千三百四十五亩中，超过定额一千三百多亩，节约油料二千四百多公斤。到九月中旬，部队已垦荒十九万多亩，在新垦的荒地上按照科学的轮作计划已种了一部分秋播作物。目前，垦荒工作正在紧张进行，预计在封冻前，可完成垦荒六十四万多亩的任务。
