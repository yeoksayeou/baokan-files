    Lanzhou Railway Hub Project, A Large-Scale Project, Starts Construction
    (Our Dispatch) The main project of the Lanzhou Railway Hub—the Lanzhou West Station—has commenced construction, with more than thirty scrapers and bulldozers leveling the ground.
    With the development of large-scale economic construction in the Northwest and the increasingly close ties between the Northwest and other parts of the country, a large number of Soviet machinery and equipment will be transported to our country via the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty International Railway, which is under construction. The transportation tasks of the Longhai, Lanxin, and Baolan railway lines will become increasingly heavy in the future. In order to adapt to this situation, the state has decided to establish a railway hub at the intersection of these three railway lines to uniformly handle passenger and freight transport on these three main lines. The hub extends from Jiaojiawan in the east to Hekou in the west, spanning more than 40 kilometers. Lanzhou West Station is the main part of this hub, including a marshalling yard, locomotive depot, rolling stock depot, freight yard, and auxiliary passenger station. In the future, trains from various railway lines will be reassembled here and then transport large quantities of goods and passengers to their destinations through the extensive railway network. Lanzhou West Station is very large in scale, and the layout is completely based on Soviet experience, and the equipment is also the most advanced. For example, the marshalling yard will be laid with dozens of tracks in the future, allowing operations on dozens of tracks simultaneously. The decoupling and marshalling of freight cars after entering the station will be completely operated by electrical machinery, and thousands of freight cars can be marshalled per day and night. In the locomotive depot's washing, repair, and overhaul depot, the heavy parts of the locomotives under repair are moved back and forth by cranes ranging from one ton to ten tons. The coal storage yard in the locomotive depot uses the most advanced "elevated coal unloading line" for unloading coal, and the locomotives use coal grabbers for coaling, which will not only shorten the turnaround time of locomotives and rolling stock, but also greatly reduce manual labor. In order to transport a large number of livestock to the outside, a livestock loading and unloading yard will also be established here.

    规模巨大的兰州铁路枢纽工程动工兴建
    本报讯　兰州铁路枢纽主要工程——兰州西站已动工，三十多台铲运机和堆土机正在平整场地。
    随着西北大规模经济建设的发展和西北同全国各地联系的日益密切，苏联大批机械设备将由正在修建的兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图国际铁路运到我国，陇海、兰新、包兰三条铁路干线的运输任务今后越来越繁重。为了适应这一情况，国家决定在这三条铁路交叉的地方建立一个铁路枢纽，统一办理这三条干线的客运货运。枢纽东到焦家湾，西到河口，长四十多公里。兰州西站是这个枢纽的主要部分，包括编组场、机务段、车辆段、货场及附属客站，将来从各条铁路汇集拢来的列车，要在这里重新编组，然后再通过四通八达的铁路网将大量的货物和旅客运送到目的地去。兰州西站规模很大，平面布置完全是按照苏联经验布局的，设备也是最先进的。如编组场将来要铺设几十条股道，可以同时在几十条股道上作业。货车进站后的解体、编组工作完全用电气机械操纵，一昼夜可编组几千辆货车。机务段的洗修和架修库内，检修的机车笨重零件，都由起重一吨到十吨的吊车来回调动。机务段煤仓卸煤使用最先进的“架高卸煤线”，机车上煤使用攫煤机，不仅会缩短机车车辆的周转时间，而且会大大减少体力劳动。为了向外运送大批牲畜，这里还将设立一个牲畜装卸场。
