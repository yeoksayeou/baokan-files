Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th. The Chinese Goods Exhibition officially opened in Tokyo at 10:00 AM on the 18th.

Thousands of Japanese people and Tokyo residents, who had been eagerly anticipating the event, gathered in front of the exhibition hall an hour before the opening, anxiously waiting for the doors to open. As soon as the doors were opened, the audience poured into the exhibition hall like a flood. Among them were trade merchants, manufacturers, technical experts, laborers, cultural workers, students, citizens, housewives, and people who had come from the outskirts of Tokyo.

Although it had been raining since noon, the enthusiasm of the visitors remained undiminished. According to preliminary statistics, the number of visitors on the first day reached 34,000 to 35,000. The rich exhibits in the exhibition hall aroused great interest among the audience. Many visitors held notebooks, noting down numbers and names in front of the charts of China's First Five-Year Economic Construction Plan, the charts of the Huai River harnessing project, and various agricultural products, industrial products, and art products. Some even took pictures of various treasures.

Since the opening ceremony of the exhibition on the 17th, Japanese audiences have expressed their admiration for the great construction achievements of New China with deep emotion. Former President of Tokyo University, Shigeru Nanbara, said after seeing the exhibits: "Today, I truly feel like I have seen the prototype of New China. This is not only a commodity exhibition but also a combination of friendship between the two peoples." Fujitaro Fujita, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, said after visiting the exhibition: "The strongest impressions for me are the lathes and other machine tools, as well as the exquisite ivory and jade crafts. Such crafts have long been famous, but I was truly surprised by the excellence of the machine tools."

Kuro Kano, Manager of the Hakodate Shipbuilding Company, said: "The Chinese Exhibition Hall is huge, and the various exhibits are purely Chinese things, which gives the Japanese people a deep impression." Masao Nakayama, Deputy Chief of the Fertilizer Department of Toyo Cotton Company, said after seeing the large number of machines on display: "I feel how foolish the 'embargo' on China is."

Other male and female students and housewives expressed great interest and praise for the construction achievements of New China, the rapid development of industry, and the exquisite craftsmanship of handicrafts. One student said, "We are taught in school that China is an agricultural country. But it is truly unimaginable that China can produce such good machines."

After seeing the exhibits, countless audiences flocked to the cinema attached to the exhibition. The place was packed. The audience enjoyed China's excellent films with great pleasure.

The audience was very happy to be able to buy China's famous teas, fruits, and handicrafts at the souvenir shop. At the same time, they were also very happy to go to the "Chinese Restaurant" attached to the exhibition to taste Chinese food.

The grand occasion of the first day of the exhibition was unprecedented, and the Japanese people expressed their deep friendship towards New China.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th. The Chinese Goods Exhibition Delegation held a banquet in Tokyo on the evening of the 18th.

Those invited to the banquet included Shōzō Murata, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association; Kumaichi Yamamoto, Vice President; Kōichi Nakamura, representative of the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade; Hisayoshi Shinomiya, Chairman of the Local Assembly Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade; Kazuo Suzuki, Executive Director of the Japan-China Trade Association; Fusanosuke Kuhara, President of the National Council for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations; Motojirō Sugiyama, Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives of Japan; Hisao Kuroda, Chairman of the Japan Labor-Farmer Party; Yoshio Shiga, member of the Japanese Communist Party; Kazutsura Kawase, Standing Director of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations; Minoru Takano, Standing Secretary of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan; Shiji Yoshida, Chairman of the All Japan Congress of Industrial Organizations; Yoshiyuki Imada, Chairman of the Japan Trade Promotion Agreement Council; Kanzo Uchimura, Vice-Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association; Yūichi Horie, Vice-Chairman of the Japan-Soviet Friendship Association; Kenjuro Yanagida, Deputy Secretary-General of the Japan Peace Committee; Seiichiro Sakai, Secretary-General of the Japan Literary Artists Association; Han Tok-su, Chairman of the Central Assembly of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan; Kang Mingqiu, representative of overseas Chinese in Japan; Zhang Jiajue, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Tokyo Chinese Chamber of Commerce; as well as more than 400 celebrities from all walks of life in Japan and heads of various trade organizations.

Cao Zhongshu, head of the Chinese Goods Exhibition Delegation, spoke at the banquet. He first expressed his gratitude to people from all walks of life in Japan who care about and enthusiastically promote the development of Sino-Japanese trade for their efforts. He pointed out that, with the joint efforts of the peoples of the two countries, despite external artificial obstacles, the two sides have successively reached three Sino-Japanese trade agreements. However, this is still far from the actual level of trade that can be carried out between the two countries.

Cao Zhongshu emphasized that China and Japan have many commodities that can be exchanged and that there is geographical and shipping convenience. If there are no artificial obstacles, and if the Japanese people can fully and independently control the key to their own foreign trade, then many materials can be freely exchanged between them every year. This kind of trade is beneficial to the economic and cultural undertakings of the two countries and to the lives of the two peoples.

Shōzō Murata then delivered a speech. He pointed out the increasing understanding between the peoples of China and Japan in recent years. He expressed his intention to continue to work to make the Chinese Goods Exhibition a success and raised a glass to invite everyone to toast to the success of the Chinese Goods Exhibition.

Kōichi Nakamura, a member of the Socialist Party in the Diet, spoke on behalf of the Diet Members' League for Promoting Japan-China Trade. He expressed his respect for the efforts made by the Chinese side in implementing the Sino-Japanese trade agreement. He expressed his willingness to continue to unite with all parties and factions to overcome artificial obstacles so that Sino-Japanese trade can achieve the development it deserves.

Kanzo Uchimura, Vice-Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, continued to speak. He expressed his full support for the opinion expressed in the joint communique published by Peng Zhen, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Eikichi Kamabayashi, head of the Japanese Diet Members' Delegation to China, which advocated making the commodity exhibitions held in the capitals of China and Japan permanent institutions and expressed his willingness to work to promote its realization. His speech won warm applause from the audience.

Kazuo Suzuki, Minoru Takano, Kimiko Abe, Han Tok-su, and others also gave speeches at the banquet.

The banquet continued for about three hours in a friendly and pleasant atmosphere before the guests and hosts parted with joy.

    盼望已久的日本人民和东京市民有好几千人在展览会开放前一小时就聚集在展览馆门前，焦急地等候展览馆开放，馆门打开之后，观众如同洪流似的涌入展览馆。其中有贸易商人、制造商人、技术专家、劳动者、文化工作者、学生、市民、家庭主妇以及从东京近郊赶来的人们。
    虽然从中午起就下着雨，但是参观的人们依然非常踊跃。据初步统计，第一天参观的人数达三万四、五千人之多。展览馆内丰富的展品引起了观众们莫大的兴趣。许多观众拿着笔记本，在中国第一个五年经济建设计划的图表前，在治淮工程图表前，在各种农产品、工业品、艺术品前面，记着数字和名称。有的还将各种珍品拍成照片。
    从展览会在十七日举行开幕仪式以来，日本观众怀着深厚的情感，表示了对新中国的伟大建设成就的赞佩。前东京大学校长南原繁看到展品后说：“我今天真正像看到了新中国的雏形。这不仅是商品展览会，而且也是两国人民友谊的结合”。日本工会总评议会主席藤田藤太郎看完展览会后说：“给我最强烈的印象是鏇床等工作母机以及精巧的象牙和玉器等工艺品。这样的工艺品虽早已闻名，而对工作母机的优秀，实在感到惊讶。”
    函馆造船公司经理加纳久朗说：“中国展览馆规模巨大，各种展品纯粹是中国的东西，这给予日本人民以深刻的印象”。东洋棉花公司谷肥部次长中山昌生看到展出的大量机械后说，我感到对中国“禁运”是多么愚蠢的事。
    其他男女学生、家庭主妇都对新中国的建设成就，工业的飞跃发展，手工艺品的精巧表示了莫大的兴趣和称赞。有一个学生这样说，“学校里教给我们说，中国是一个农业国。但中国能生产这样好的机械，真是想像不到的。”
    无数的观众们在看完了展览品以后，就涌向展览会附设的电影馆。那里的人拥挤得水泄不通。观众们都以莫大的愉快的心情，欣赏了中国的优秀影片。
    观众很高兴能够在纪念品小卖部买到中国的有名的各种茶叶、果品和手工艺品。同时，他们也很欢喜到展览会附设的“中国饭馆”去尝尝中国饭菜。
    展览会开放第一天的盛况是空前的，日本人民对新中国表示了深厚的友谊。
    新华社东京十九日电　中国商品展览团十八日晚间，在东京举行了宴会。
    应邀参加宴会的有日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏、副会长山本熊一，日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表中村高一，日本地方议员促进日中贸易联盟主席四宫久吉，中日贸易会专务理事铃木一雄，日本恢复日中日苏邦交国民会议会长久原房之助，日本众议院副议长杉山元治郎，日本劳农党主席黑田寿男，日本共产党议员志贺义雄，日本经济团体联合会常任理事川濑一贯，日本工会总评议会常任干事高野实，全日本产业别工会会议主席吉田资治，日本工会促进国际贸易协议会主席今田义之，日中友好协会副会长内山完造，日苏亲善协会副会长堀江邑一，日本拥护和平委员会副总书记柳田谦十郎，日本文艺家协会书记局长酒井诚一郎，在日朝鲜人总联合会中央议长韩德铢，旅日华侨代表康鸣球，东京华侨总会理事会主席张加爵以及日本各界名流和各贸易机构负责人共四百多人。
    中国商品展览团团长曹中枢在宴会上讲话。他首先对关心和热心促进中日贸易发展的日本各界人士所作的努力表示谢意。他指出：在两国人民的共同努力下，尽管有着外来的人为的障碍，双方还是先后达成了三次中日贸易协定。但是，这距离两国之间可以进行贸易的实际程度还很远。
    曹中枢强调说：中日两国有着很多可以交换的商品，并且存在着地理和航运上的便利，如果没有人为的障碍，如果日本人民能够充分自主地掌握住自己对外贸易的大门的钥匙，那末每年有许多物资可以相互自由交换。这种贸易，对于两国的经济文化事业，对于两国人民的生活都是有益的。
    村田省藏接着致词。他在指出中日两国人民之间的了解几年来日益增进的情况。他表示要继续努力使中国商品展览会获得成功，并且举杯请大家为中国商品展览会的成功干杯。
    社会党国会议员中村高一代表日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟致词。他对中国方面在执行中日贸易协定方面所作的努力表示敬意。他表示愿意继续同各党各派团结一起为克服人为的障碍使中日贸易得到应有的发展而努力。
    日中友好协会副会长内山完造继起致词，他对于中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会秘书长彭真和日本国会议员访华团团长上林山荣吉发表的联合公报中主张把在中日两国首都举行的商品展览会作为常设机构的意见表示完全支持，并且愿意努力促其实现。他的发言博得全场热烈的掌声。
    在宴会上致词的还有铃木一雄，高野实，安部君子，韩德铢等。
    宴会在友好愉快的气氛中继续了约三小时，宾主才尽欢而散。
