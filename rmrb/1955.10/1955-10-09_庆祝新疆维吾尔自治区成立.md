    Celebrating the Establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region
    The Second Session of the First People's Congress of Xinjiang Province successfully concluded on September 30th. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China was simultaneously proclaimed.
    All the representatives attending the meeting unanimously adopted the resolution to endorse the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and the abolition of the Xinjiang Province system, and elected the members of the People's Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region by secret ballot.
    The establishment of this autonomous region is a major event in the political life of the Uyghur people and other ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and it is also another significant step forward in our country's implementation of the policy of ethnic regional autonomy.
    On October 1st, 60,000 people of all ethnic groups in Urumqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, held a celebration rally to warmly celebrate the 6th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the establishment of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. (Attached picture)
