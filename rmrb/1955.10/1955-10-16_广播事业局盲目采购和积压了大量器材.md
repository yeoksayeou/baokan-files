    Blind Procurement and Stockpiling of Large Amounts of Equipment by the Bureau of Broadcasting
    To the Editor:
    The Bureau of Broadcasting has had a very serious problem with stockpiling equipment for a long time. Since the beginning of 1953, the Ministry of Finance and relevant departments have repeatedly inspected this situation and put forward opinions; the People's Daily also published a reader's letter criticizing this on April 21, 1953. Although the Bureau of Broadcasting also made self-criticisms, it did not effectively improve its work, so that the old stockpiles had not yet been disposed of, and new stockpiles continued to occur. According to the budget situation, at the end of 1954, the book value balance of the bureau's inventory of maintenance equipment was 7.28 million yuan, which is more than 13 times the actual consumption in the past year. Since many equipments were not valued, and the inventory equipment of each relay station was not included, the actual situation of equipment stockpiling is even more serious. In addition, the bureau also has a large backlog of basic construction equipment.
    The Bureau of Broadcasting only considers the convenience of its own unit in using equipment and blindly procures it regardless of actual needs, resulting in many materials being prepared but not used, and even some being prepared after they are damaged. The situation of their preparing cement for a certain iron tower foundation project is an example. At the beginning of 1954, they bought more than 400 tons of cement. At that time, the project design had not been finalized, and the construction site had not been formally established. The purchased cement was stored at another construction site. During the rainy season, most of it deteriorated and became ineffective due to improper storage. At the beginning of this year, the construction conditions for this project were still not available, and even the arrangement of the iron tower had not been determined, but they bought another 435 tons of cement, resulting in the cement being stockpiled until now. 200 tons of the cement produced in January has exceeded the storage period and deteriorated, and the quality of 235 tons produced in March has also decreased. The stockpiling of cables is also very serious. In recent years, they have blindly ordered a large number of cables from abroad, most of which have been stockpiled. This year, they ordered another batch of cables from abroad, resulting in new stockpiles. For example, they ordered an ammonia machine from abroad last year, without clarifying when it would arrive. They then bought 75 bottles of ammonia in the spring of this year and transported them to the construction site. Until now, there is still no news of the arrival of the ammonia machine. During this period, the rental fee for the bottles alone will be more than 3,400 yuan, and the deposit for renting the bottles is 37,500 yuan.
    The Bureau of Broadcasting's blindly increasing the consumption quota and reserve quota of major maintenance equipment is also a reason for the stockpiling. For example, most of the electronic tubes need to be ordered from abroad, generally once a year; however, they blindly order according to the consumption of four years, resulting in the stockpiles increasing year by year. A certain electronic tube generally does not have problems after 6,000 hours of use, but they calculate it according to a life of 3,000 hours. As a result, 136 electronic tubes were ordered in 1953, and 116 were still stockpiled by the end of last year, worth more than 725,000 yuan. Due to the long storage time of the electronic tubes and poor storage, the phenomenon of deterioration and damage is also very serious.
    The equipment management department of the Bureau of Broadcasting has not taken active measures to deal with the stockpiled equipment. Since the usage departments do not know the situation of the stockpiled equipment in the warehouse, some equipment is stockpiled in large quantities in the warehouse, but the usage departments purchase it everywhere outside. For example, last year a transmitter station needed 16 magnetron sockets, and the equipment department sent someone to Tianjin to buy 16. Because the bayonet was not suitable, they went to Shanghai to buy 15 more. Later, they found that there were more than 90 magnetron sockets in the warehouse that could be used. More seriously, they knew that there was a large backlog of certain equipment, but they still ordered it from outside. For example, when the Ministry of Finance inspected the Bureau of Broadcasting in 1953, it pointed out that a batch of recording tapes had been stockpiled for a long time, so that some of them had blistered and deteriorated. At that time, the director of the equipment department of the Bureau of Broadcasting said that he would make a self-criticism, but more than ten days later, he actually signed a contract to import a batch of recording tapes of the same specifications. Fortunately, this batch of goods was not ordered, otherwise it would have been stockpiled with the original recording tapes until now.
    I think that the relevant leading authorities should check the serious waste of the Bureau of Broadcasting and take effective measures to deal with this batch of stockpiled materials.

### 广播事业局盲目采购和积压了大量器材

    广播事业局盲目采购和积压了大量器材编辑同志：
    广播事业局长期以来积压器材的现象十分严重。从一九五三年初以来，财政部和有关部门对这种情况曾多次进行检查，并提出意见；人民日报在一九五三年四月二十一日也发表了读者的批评信。广播事业局虽然也作了检讨，但是并没有切实改进工作，以致旧的积压还没有处理，新的积压却继续发生。根据决算情况反映，一九五四年年底这个局的库存维护器材的账面价值余额为七百二十八万元，等于去年一年实际消耗的十三倍多。由于有许多器材没有估价，各转播台的库存器材也没有计算在内，因此器材积压的实际情况还要严重。此外，这个局的基本建设器材也有大量积压。
    广播事业局只顾本单位使用器材方便，不根据实际需要盲目采购，结果很多材料备而不用，甚至有的坏了再备。他们为某铁塔基础工程准备水泥的情况就是一个例子。一九五四年初他们就买了水泥四百多吨，当时工程设计还没有确定，工地根本没有正式成立，购买的水泥寄存在另一个工地，到雨季就因为保管不当而大部分变质失效；今年年初，这个工程的施工条件仍然不具备，就连铁塔的布置方位都没有确定，但是他们又买了水泥四百三十五吨，结果水泥积压到现在，一月份出厂的二百吨已经超过存放期而变质失效，三月份出厂的二百三十五吨质量也降低了。电缆的积压也很严重。几年来他们盲目向国外订购大批电缆，大部分都积压下来了；今年他们又向国外订购一批电缆，结果造成新的积压。又如，他们在去年向国外订购了一台氨气机，也没有搞清什么时候到货，就在今年春天购买了氨气七十五瓶运到工地；直到现在，氨气机仍然没有到货消息，在这期间仅瓶子的租金就要支付三千四百多元，租用瓶子的押金付出了三万七千五百元。
    广播事业局盲目提高主要维护器材的消耗定额和储备定额，也是造成积压的一个原因。例如，电子管大部分需要向国外订货，一般的情况是每年订一次；然而他们却盲目按照四年的消耗量订货，结果积压逐年增多。某种电子管一般使用六千小时出不了问题，他们却按寿命三千小时计算；结果一九五三年订了电子管一百三十六只，到去年年底还积压了一百一十六只，价值七十二万五千多元。由于电子管存放日久，保管不善，变质损坏的现象也十分严重。
    广播事业局器材管理部门对于积压器材一直不采取积极措施进行处理。由于库存积压器材的情况并不为使用部门所掌握，因此某些器材在仓库里大量积压着，使用部门却到外面到处采购。例如，去年某发射台需要磁管座十六个，器材处就派人到天津买来十六个，因为卡口不合适又到上海购买十五个，后来发现仓库里存着九十多个磁管座可以使用。更严重的是，某些器材他们明知有大量积压，但是仍然向外面去订货。例如，一九五三年财政部到广播事业局检查的时候，曾提出有一批录音片长期积压，以致有一部分已经起泡变质的情况。当时广播事业局器材处处长表示要作检讨，但是十几天以后，他竟又去签订进口一批同样规格的录音片的合同。幸好这批货没有订到，不然就将同原存的录音片一直积压到现在。
    我认为，有关领导机关应该检查广播事业局的这种严重浪费情况，并采取有效措施处理这批积压的物资。　郝莲承
