　　**Actively Support the Agricultural Cooperative Movement**
　　**More Than 150,000 Double and Single-Share Plows Promoted in Various Regions in Over Three Months**

　　(Our Newspaper News) Workers in state-owned and local state-owned agricultural machinery factories across the country are working hard to produce large quantities of new-style animal-powered farm tools to actively support the agricultural cooperative movement. Agricultural implement factories in various regions plan to produce more than 590,000 new-style animal-powered farm tools from October this year to the beginning of 1956, and to increase production of 110,000 double-wheeled double-share plows and double-wheeled single-share plows.

　　With the rapid development of the agricultural cooperative movement, organized farmers will need more and more new-style animal-powered farm tools. This year is the first year for large-scale production of new-style animal-powered farm tools. Among the more than 30 factories producing agricultural implements in various regions, more than 20 factories had not produced agricultural implements in the past. Therefore, there were great technical difficulties. In the first quarter of this year, most factories were still in the stage of sample trial production and small-batch production, and the quality did not meet the specified requirements. However, thanks to the efforts of the workers in the agricultural implement manufacturing plants, after the second quarter, large-scale production began on the basis of gradually improving quality. Now, the product quality of most agricultural implement factories has reached the specified requirements. By the end of September, 25 factories producing double-wheeled double (single) share plows had produced more than 329,000 double-wheeled double (single) share plows. Chongqing Machinery Iron Factory had never produced agricultural implements in the past, but this year it has produced more than 1,600 double-wheeled single-share plows and more than 9,900 new-style walking plows. Hubei Provincial Agricultural Implement Factory produced more than 5,500 double-wheeled double-share plows this year to supply the countryside. Hefei Agricultural Implement Factory in Anhui Province also began producing more than 2,960 double-wheeled double-share plows for farmers this year. The planned total output value of new-style agricultural implements produced by Gansu Agricultural Implement Factory and Tianshui Agricultural Implement Factory this year will increase by more than six times compared with last year. According to the characteristics of Gansu Province, which has more mountainous areas, these two factories have produced more than 21,000 mountain walking plows, more than 14,000 7-inch walking plows, and a large number of liberation-style waterwheels this year. The output of major new-style agricultural implements such as May 1st walking plow and rice threshing machine produced by Guangdong Agricultural Implement Factory this year has increased more than three times compared with last year. The workers of Songjiang Machinery Factory have sent more than 10,000 ten-row seeders and double-wheeled double-share plows to the countryside this year, and are now manufacturing ten-row strip seeders and preparing to trial-produce granular fertilizer seeders, large double-wheeled double-share plows, wind-powered seed selectors and other new-style agricultural implements according to the opinions of farmers.

　　At present, many agricultural implement factories are enthusiastically launching labor competitions to ensure the completion of new production increase tasks. Workers at the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory are working hard to increase production by 6,000 double-wheeled double-share plows, 70,000 steel plowshares, and 70,000 plow mirrors from October 20th to the end of the year; the double-wheeled double-share plow workshop has seen new production records every day in recent days. Workers at the Kaifeng Machinery Factory in Henan Province are fully launching a labor competition to strive to complete the manufacturing task of double-wheeled double-share plows 40 days ahead of schedule. All the workers in the factory also decided to increase the production of 10,000 double-wheeled double-share plows by the end of the year after completing the annual plan ahead of schedule. Workers at the Xinzhou County Agricultural Implement Factory in Hubei Province launched a labor competition and overfulfilled the production plan for August and September. The new-style walking plows produced by nine agricultural implement factories and handicraft production cooperatives in Guangdong Province this year will exceed the original plan by more than one time. Guangdong Agricultural Implement Factory has decided to manufacture 2,500 more 53 walking plows before the end of this year, and is preparing to manufacture double-wheeled double-share plows in large quantities in December. At present, all workers are enthusiastically launching a labor competition.

　　(Our Newspaper News) From July to the beginning of October, farmers in various regions have purchased more than 158,000 double-wheeled double (single) share plows, which is nearly double the number promoted in the first half of the year. During this period, farmers in Hebei Province purchased more than 42,000 units, which is eleven times greater than the number promoted in the first half of the year in the province. Shanxi and Liaoning provinces have now completed 75% of the annual promotion plan. At present, many regions, in order to meet the current needs of farmers, have requested to increase the number of promotions. Seven provinces including Shanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hebei, and Jiangsu have requested to increase more than 37,000 units before October. It is estimated that the national plan to promote 400,000 units this year can be completed.

　　In order to do a good job in the supply of new-style agricultural implements, the party and government leading departments in many regions have held meetings or issued instructions to make arrangements for the promotion of new-style agricultural implements. After the Anhui Provincial Party Committee held a meeting on agricultural implement work, various regions actively organized forces to carry out technical guidance and sales, and sold more than 2,000 double-wheeled double (single) share plows in less than a month. Hubei Province also allocated more than 570,000 yuan in agricultural loans as special loans for new-style agricultural implements to help farmers purchase double-wheeled double (single) share plows. Supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural and other relevant departments in various regions also actively transferred new agricultural implements. At present, more than 354,000 units have been transferred to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties, accounting for 90% of this year's promotion plan.

　　In the promotion of double-wheeled double (single) share plows, various regions have also paid attention to technical training. According to incomplete statistics from Hebei, Anhui, and Shandong provinces, 60,000 agricultural technicians and agricultural implement operators have been trained. After training, agricultural implement operators generally learn how to use agricultural implements and simple repair techniques. At the same time, various regions have also paid attention to the repair and maintenance of new agricultural implements. More than 600 repair stations, groups, and points have been established in six special zones including Handan, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou in Hebei Province, and more than 2,400 repair workers have been trained. Anhui Province trained more than 500 repair workers from iron production cooperatives, established more than 180 agricultural implement repair stations and repair groups, and helped farmers repair agricultural implements by means of contracting by district and mobile tours, which was very popular among the masses.

    全国各地农具厂生产大批新式农具
    积极支援农业合作化运动
    三个多月各地推广双、单铧犁十五万多部
    本报讯　全国各地国营和地方国营农业机械厂的职工们正在努力生产大批新式畜力农具，积极支援农业合作化运动。各地农具厂计划从今年十月份起到一九五六年年初，除保证完成五十九万多部新式畜力农具的生产任务外，再增产十一万部双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁。
    随着农业合作化运动的迅速发展，组织起来的农民将愈来愈多地需要大量的新式畜力农具。今年是开始大量生产新式畜力农具的第一年。在各地三十多个生产农具的工厂中，有二十多个厂过去没有生产过农具，因此，在技术上发生很大困难。今年第一季度一般厂还处于样品试制和小批生产阶段，质量还达不到所规定的要求。但是，由于农具制造厂职工们的努力，第二季度以后，就在逐步提高质量的基础上，开始大量生产。现在，一般农具厂的产品质量都达到了所规定的要求。到九月底为止，二十五个生产双轮双（单）铧犁的工厂，已经生产了双轮双（单）铧犁三十二万九千多部。重庆机器铁工厂过去从来没有生产过农具，今年已经生产了一千六百多部双轮单铧犁和九千九百多部新式步犁。湖北省农具厂今年生产了五千五百多部双轮双铧犁供应农村。安徽省合肥农具厂今年也开始为农民生产了二千九百六十多部双轮双铧犁。甘肃农具制造厂和天水农具厂今年生产的新式农具总产值计划比去年增加六倍多。根据甘肃省山地较多的特点，这两个厂今年已经生产了山地步犁二万一千多部、七吋步犁一万四千多部，还有大批解放式水车。广东农具厂今年五一步犁和打禾机等主要新式农具的产量都比去年增加三倍以上。松江机械厂的职工们，今年已把一万多台十行播种机和双轮双铧犁送到了农村，现在正根据农民的意见制造十行条播机和准备试制颗粒肥料播种机、大型双轮双铧犁、风车选种机等新式农具。
    目前，许多农具厂正热烈展开劳动竞赛，保证新的增产任务的完成。北京农业机械厂职工正努力争取从十月二十日到年底前增产六千部双轮双铧犁、七万片钢犁铧和七万片犁镜；双轮双铧犁车间最近几天每天都出现了生产新纪录。河南省开封机械厂职工为争取提前四十天完成全年双轮双铧犁的制造任务，正全面展开劳动竞赛。全厂职工还决定在提前完成年度计划以后，到年底再增产双轮双铧犁一万部。湖北省新洲县农具厂职工们开展了劳动竞赛，超额完成了八、九月份的生产计划。广东省九家农具厂和手工业生产合作社今年生产的新式步犁将比原计划超出一倍以上。广东农具厂已经决定在今年年底以前多制造二千五百部五三步犁，并准备在十二月间大批制造双轮双铧犁。目前全体职工正热烈开展劳动竞赛。
    本报讯　从七月到十月上旬止，各地农民已购买了十五万八千多部双轮双（单）铧犁，超过上半年推广的数字将近一倍。在这个期间，河北省农民购买了四万二千多部，比全省上半年推广的数字大十一倍。山西、辽宁两省现已完成了全年推广计划百分之七十五。目前，许多地区为适应当前农民的需要，要求增加推广数目。山西、河南、湖北、河北、江苏等七省共要求在十月前增加三万七千多部。据估计，今年全国推广四十万部的计划可以完成。
    为了做好新式农具的供应工作，许多地区的党、政领导部门召开了会议或发出了指示，对新式农具的推广工作作了安排。中共安徽省委会召开了农具工作会议后，各地积极地组织力量进行技术指导和推销，不到一个月就推销了二千多部双轮双（单）铧犁。湖北省还在农贷中拨出五十七万多元贷款作为新式农具专业贷款，帮助农民购买双轮双（单）铧犁。各地供销合作社和农业等有关部门也积极调运新农具，目前，已调到各县基层供销合作社三十五万四千多部，占今年推广计划百分之九十。
    在推广双轮双（单）铧犁工作中，各地也注意了技术传授工作。据河北、安徽、山东三省不完全统计，已训练农业技术人员和农具手六万名。经过训练的农具手，一般都学会了使用农具和简单的装修技术。同时各地也注意了新农具的修配工作。河北省邯郸、唐山、张家口等六个专区，已建立了修配站、组、点六百多个，训练了修配工人二千四百多名。安徽省训练了铁业生产合作社的修理工人五百多名，建立农具修配站和修配组一百八十多个，用分片包干、流动串乡等方式，帮助农民修配农具，很受到群众的欢迎。
