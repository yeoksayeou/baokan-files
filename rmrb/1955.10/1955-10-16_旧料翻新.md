    Renovating Old Materials
    Yang Guomin, Ding Jianping
    Yarn and cloth are indispensable items in our daily lives. Clothes, shoes, socks, hats, and bedding are all made of yarn and cloth. Yarn and cloth are also important auxiliary raw materials for many industries. Due to the improvement of people's lives and the development of national industrial construction, the demand for yarn and cloth is increasing day by day. Therefore, using yarn and cloth sparingly has broad social significance. In our big country with a population of 600 million, if each person saves one inch of yarn and one inch of cloth each year, it will be a considerable figure. Whether it is to better meet the needs of people's lives or to increase accumulation for the country, it has great benefits.
    There are many ways to save yarn and cloth. In addition to yarn factories and enterprises that use yarn and cloth for production striving to save, there are also many saving methods with universal significance.
    The Shenyang No. 3 Sewing Production Cooperative's method of renovating old clothes is a method worth promoting. From December 1954 to August this year, the cooperative used old clothes, old flour sacks, old canvas, tents, and other materials. After selection, dismantling, washing, tailoring, mending or remaking, dyeing, and other processing procedures, they made more than 34,000 pieces of "renovated clothing." The general wearability of these clothes can reach 60% to 70% of new clothes. Renovated clothes made of canvas are even more durable than new cotton clothes. If calculated according to 65% of the use value, these clothes can save the country the consumption of more than 150,000 feet of cotton cloth, or more than 80,000 yuan of wealth. Because this kind of clothing is durable and inexpensive (the factory price of a set of cotton clothes is only 3.50 yuan at most, and canvas clothes are 4.50 yuan), it is welcomed by the broad masses of working people. In addition to meeting the needs of the people of Shenyang, it is also sold to Siping City, Inner Mongolia, and Penglai and Huang County in Shandong. From January to July this year, due to the development of production, the cooperative not only made up for the loss of more than 1,900 yuan last year, but also had a surplus of more than 10,000 yuan.
    A pair of worn-out socks may seem useless, right? However, the fact is not so. These socks can become useful things in the hands of some unemployed workers in Beijing and some housewives in Wuxi, Jiangsu. Unemployed workers in Beijing have spontaneously organized to purchase old socks from various places, use the sock tube part, dismantle, wash, and dye them, and then weave them into socks and sell them to consumers at low prices. The selling price of these socks is only 20 to 30 cents. It reduces the burden on consumers and also saves cotton yarn. According to the statistics of more than 50 households that have already been organized by the Beijing Cooperative, about 42,500 kilograms of new cotton yarn can be saved each year. In addition, in order to make the socks durable, they also use new yarn for the sock bottom and sock back, and recycled yarn for the sock tube. In Wuxi City, some housewives specialize in mending socks for customers. Two pairs are combined into one pair, long socks are changed to short socks, or large socks are changed to small socks, etc. The wage is two cents per pair. This method is also welcomed by consumers.
    Unifying and reducing the specifications of towels without affecting consumer use can also save a lot of cotton yarn. The towels we usually use are always broken in the middle, but the four sides are still good. If we remake it, for example, on the basis of the 414 towel specification, the country uniformly shortens the length by 3 centimeters and the width by 2 centimeters, then about 1,076,000 kilograms of cotton yarn can be saved in a year (excluding the self-woven and self-sold part).
    Some shops and banks in some cities still use cotton yarn to wrap small general merchandise and banknotes. In the past, Shanghai alone consumed 7,000 to 8,000 kilograms of cotton yarn each year for wrapping. If paper rope is used for wrapping, it will also save the country a lot of cotton yarn.
    In short, there are many ways to save yarn and cloth. Every inch of yarn and every inch of cloth are useful things in our socialist industrialization cause. We should take various measures to use it sparingly.

    旧料翻新
    杨国民　丁建平
    纱和布是我们日常生活中不可缺少的东西。衣服、鞋袜、帽子和被褥等，都是纱布做成的。纱和布同时也是许多工业的重要辅助原料。由于人民生活的提高和国家工业建设的发展，对纱布的需要量日渐增多，所以节约地使用纱布就具有广泛的社会意义。在我们这个拥有六亿人口的大国里，每人每年节约一寸纱、一寸布，就会是一个相当可观的数字，不论从更好地满足人民生活需要，或从为国家增加积累来看，都有很大的好处。
    节约使用纱、布的方法很多。除了纱厂和使用纱布生产的企业要努力节约外，还有许多种具有普遍意义的节约办法。
    沈阳市第三缝纫生产合作社利用旧布翻新装，就是一个值得提倡的办法。从一九五四年十二月到今年八月，这个合作社利用旧衣服、旧面袋、旧帆布、帐篷等材料，经过挑选、拆洗、裁剪、补换或改制、染色等加工过程，制成了三万四千多件“更新服装”。这些服装一般的穿用程度都能达到新衣的六成至七成。利用帆布做的更新衣服，甚至比新棉布衣还经穿。如果按照百分之六十五的使用价值来计算，这些服装就能为国家节约十五万多尺棉布的消耗，或八万多元的财富。由于这种服装耐用和价格便宜（一套棉布服出厂价格最高只三元五角，帆布服四元五角），因此受到了广大劳动人民的欢迎。它除了供应沈阳市人民的需要外，还远销四平市、内蒙古地区和山东的蓬莱、黄县等地。今年一至七月，由于生产的发展，这个合作社除了弥补去年亏损的一千九百多元外，还盈余了一万多元。
    一双破旧的袜子，看来是没有用处了吧？然而事实却不是这样。这些袜子在北京市的某些失业工人和江苏无锡市的一些家庭妇女手里，它都可以成为有用的东西。北京市的失业工人们自动组织起来，向各处收购旧袜，利用袜筒部分，经过拆后洗染，再把它织成袜子，廉价卖给消费者。这种袜子的售价仅两、三角钱。它减轻了消费者的负担，也节约了棉纱。仅据北京市合作社现在已经组织起来的五十多户统计，每年就可以节省新棉纱约四万二千五百多公斤。此外，为了使袜子耐穿，他们还采用了袜底袜背用新纱，袜筒用回收纱的办法。在无锡市，有的家庭妇女，专为顾客并袜。两双并一双，长袜改短袜，或大袜改成小袜等等。每双工资两角。这种办法，也受到了消费者的欢迎。
    在不影响消费者使用的情况下统一缩小毛巾的规格，也能节省出大量棉纱。我们平常用的毛巾，总是中间已破，四边还好。如果把它改制一下，例如在四一四毛巾规格的基础上，全国统一在长度上缩短三公分、宽度缩小二公分，则一年中就可以节约棉纱约一百零七万六千多公斤（不包括自织自销部分）。
    有些城市的某些商店和银行，目前还用棉纱包扎零星小百货和钞票。过去，仅上海一地，每年在包扎上消耗棉纱就有七、八千公斤。如果都改用纸绳扎包，也会给国家节省很多的棉纱。
    总之，节约纱布的办法是很多的。每一寸纱、每一寸布，在我国社会主义工业化的事业中都是有用的东西，我们应该采取各种办法节约地使用它。
