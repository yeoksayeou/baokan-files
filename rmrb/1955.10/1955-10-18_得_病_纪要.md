    "Illness" Memoir
    Wang Guizhen
    The date of the college entrance examination was only a dozen days away. I took the time to go to the designated hospital—the Central Government Affiliated Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Center—for a physical examination. I also registered with the Beijing Examination Area Enrollment Committee and received my admission ticket. All the procedures were completed, and I was just waiting for the exam. I was nervous and excited. A great hope encouraged me. In my imagination, I seemed to already see myself sitting in the medical school classroom, standing next to the operating table in a white coat.... You know, I had worked as a nurse for several years. If I was going to further my education, of course, I would apply to medical school. The state had given me such a rare opportunity for further study, how could I fail to live up to this concern? For half a year, I had been diligently reviewing my lessons, persisting no matter how hot the weather was, reading and calculating, completely immersed in my studies.

    But on July 9th, I received a notice from the Enrollment Committee: "Comrade Wang Guizhen: Because you have infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis, you are unqualified according to the health examination regulations for unified college enrollment. Please come to the registration office to complete the withdrawal procedures after seeing this letter...." After reading the notice, I felt my arms suddenly go limp, and what I held in my hand felt not like a piece of paper, but like a rock weighing hundreds of pounds. I couldn't describe what I felt in my heart. To use a ready-made phrase, it was like falling into the "abyss of sorrow." I also felt listless, as if I were really sick.

    On July 12th, according to the scheduled time, I went to the outpatient department of the Second Hospital of the Central Government Affiliated Organs to request treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis. The doctor first gave me a general examination, and then took a fluoroscopy of my chest. Finally, he told me, "Your lungs are normal, there is no disease." Hearing this, my eyes suddenly blurred with moisture. It's strange, why do tears come when you are happy? I immediately went to the Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Center to tell the doctor about the situation and asked him to re-examine the original diagnosis. Unexpectedly, the doctor said, "Fluoroscopy is unreliable, you need to take an X-ray." He also said that they had sent the physical examination report to the Enrollment Committee, "and have completed their task," and did not care about the rest. I had no choice but to go to the outpatient department of the Second Hospital again to ask the doctor to make a definite diagnosis of whether I was sick or not. The doctor's answer was still affirmative, saying that I did not have pulmonary tuberculosis.

    At this time, it was already 5:00 p.m. on July 14th. Only one hour remained for completing the examination procedures. I thought: Since the two hospitals made two kinds of diagnoses, of course, there was a possibility that I was not sick. In this case, could I ask to be allowed to take the exam tomorrow, and then submit the final re-examination opinions of the two hospitals? If I really had the disease, of course, my admission could be canceled after I was admitted. So, in order to save time, I went to the Higher Education Department nearby to discuss this issue. Unexpectedly, I was stopped at a question-and-answer desk or something like that at the entrance, and the staff there said that they "didn't take care of these things." And at this time, the hands of the clock had already pointed to 6:15, and there was no way to reach the Enrollment Committee before getting off work at 6:30. I called the Enrollment Committee, stated the above situation, and made my request. But the result I heard was just this sentence: "We are off work, we can't do it now." Even the speed of electricity couldn't catch up, what other way could I think of?

    Now that the exam period has passed, the remaining question is just to clarify whether I have "infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis" or not.

    On July 21st, to be "reliable," I took an X-ray of my chest at the Second Hospital, and the results proved that my lungs were indeed free of disease. So I made a phone call to the Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Center, and again requested the doctor there to re-examine the original diagnosis. Whoever answered the phone, his reply was resolute and stern: "It's not necessary." So, what should I, a "suspected" patient with pulmonary tuberculosis, do? The diagnoses of the two hospitals are completely inconsistent. Which one should I believe? Should I treat the disease, or not? Under my repeated and tactful requests, this comrade finally agreed to take a look at the X-ray taken at the Second Hospital.

    On August 8th, I sat in the consultation room of the Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Center.

    Doctor: "Do you work full-time or part-time now?"

    I said: "I originally left my job to prepare for school examinations, and I don't have a job now. However, the examination at the Second Hospital showed that my lungs are free of disease."

    "But according to our examination, you have infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis."

    "But an X-ray taken at the Second Hospital also shows no disease."

    "Maybe it's already healed."

    "What? Can such a disease heal itself in a week or two without treatment?"

    "Because this disease is transient."

    "What does transient mean?"

    "Uh, uh, it's an inflammation of the lungs or a temporary bacterial infection..."

    "Are lung inflammation or temporary bacterial infections of the same type as infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis?"

    "Yes, you could say that."

    "Why can you say that they are of the same type?"

    "That's because the Enrollment Committee was in too much of a hurry at the time, and there was no time for re-examination."

    Look, where did he digress? What logical relationship does this answer have with whether they are "of the same type"? However, since he mentioned re-examination, I continued: "Actually, there was time for re-examination. I asked for a re-examination, but you said it was not necessary."

    "According to our examination, you have infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis."

    "Then can we compare and study the X-rays taken at the Second Hospital?"

    "No need. According to our examination, you have infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis." He repeated it like a record player. I noticed that his breathing suddenly became rapid, and several red veins clearly swelled on his neck, which meant that the doctor was angry. Perhaps this doctor misunderstood my meaning. He must have thought that I was pursuing responsibility. In fact, I just hoped that the diagnostic opinions of the two hospitals would be unified. If I was sick, I would treat the disease; if I was not sick, I could explain it to my original unit and start working again. I told him this. Obviously, it was effective. His breathing gradually calmed down, and he also agreed to take the X-rays from the Second Hospital to compare and study. As for the time, we would not see the "result" until August 18th.

    On August 18th, I sat in the consultation room of the Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Center again. This time, another doctor received me.

    "Do you work full-time or part-time now?"

    "I originally left my job to prepare for school examinations, and I don't have a job now. However, the examination at the Second Hospital showed that my lungs are free of disease."

    "But according to our examination..."

    The conversation was almost a replica of the last time, like a recording. However, at my request, this doctor finally flipped through my "medical record" that was placed on hand, and found that, according to the results of the comparison and study with the photos taken at the Second Hospital, my lungs were free of disease! The doctor fell silent.

    Here, my "illness" was considered cured. After more than forty days, I finally had the opportunity to breathe a sigh of relief. I don't have to be isolated from everyone anymore. I can confidently walk into the collective canteen to eat, and I can take off my mask and talk face-to-face with comrades without hesitation. How happy a healthy person is!

    Thank you to the two doctors at the Central Government Affiliated Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Center. They finally made me—a person who aspires to be a doctor—know how a doctor should and should not act before entering school.

    得“病”纪要 
    王桂珍
    离开高等学校的考试日期只有十几天了。我抽空到指定的医院——中央直属机关结核病防治所检查了身体，又到北京考区招生委员会报了名，领取了准考证。一切手续都办妥了，只等待着考试。我的心情紧张而又兴奋。一个大的希望鼓舞着我。在想像里，我仿佛已经看到我坐在医学院的课堂上了，我穿着白罩衫站在手术台旁边了……。要知道，我原就做过几年护士工作，要升学，当然是考医学院啰。国家给了我这么难得的升学深造的机会，我怎么可以辜负这种关怀呢。半年来我一直紧张地勤奋地复习着功课，不管天气多么热，也坚持着，看呀，算呀，我完全钻到功课里去了。
    可是七月九号那天，我接到了招生委员会的一份通知：“王桂珍同志：因你患有浸润型肺结核，根据高等学校统一招生健康检查规定为不合格，希见信后……来报名处办理退考手续。”看完通知，我觉得胳膊忽然瘫软了，手里拿的仿佛不是一张纸，而是百十来斤重的大石头。我说不出心里是怎样一种滋味，用句现成的话吧，真好像掉进“悲哀的深渊”里了。身上也觉得恹恹的，仿佛真的病了。
    七月十二日，按照预约时间，我到中央直属机关第二医院门诊部要求治疗肺结核。医生先给我作了一般检查，然后又作了爱克斯光胸部透视。最后他告诉我说：“你的肺部正常，没有病。”一听这句话，我的眼睛突然因为润湿而模糊了。真奇怪，为什么高兴也会流泪呢？我马上到结核病防治所去，把这个情况告诉大夫，要求他对原来的诊断加以复查。没想到那位大夫说：“透视是靠不住的，需要照爱克斯光照片。”他还说，他们把身体检查报告送到招生委员会，“已经完成了任务”，其余的事不管。我只好再到第二医院门诊部去请大夫为我确诊一下，倒底有没有病。大夫的答复仍然是肯定的，说我没有肺结核病。
    这时候已经是七月十四日下午五点钟了。办理考试手续的时间只剩下最后一小时了。我想：两个医院既然作出两种诊断，当然我也有无病的可能。在这种情况下，我可不可以要求允许我明天参加考试，然后补报两个医院最后复查的统一意见呢？如果真的有病，当然考取之后也还可以取消我的入学资格的。于是为了赶时间，我就到就近的高等教育部去谈这个问题。不料在门口的一个问事处之类的地方，就被挡住了，那儿的工作人员说，他们“不管这些事”。而这时候，时针已经指向六时十五分，无论如何在六点半下班以前是赶不到招生委员会了。我给招生委员会打了个电话，申述了以上情况，提出了我的要求。但结果我听到的答复只是这样一句话：“我们下班了，现在不能办了。”连电流的速度都赶不上，还能再想出什么办法呢？
    现在考期已过，剩下来的问题，只是要弄清我到底有没有“浸润型肺结核”的病了。
    七月二十一日，为了“靠得住”起见，我在第二医院照了爱克斯光胸部照片，结果证明，我的肺部的确没有病。于是我给结核病防治所挂了个电话，再次请求那里的大夫对原来的诊断加以复查。接电话的不知是什么人，他的答复是果决而又严厉的：“不必要。”那么，我，一个肺结核“嫌疑”患者到底应该怎么办呢？两个医院的诊断完全对不拢来，相信哪一个呢？是治病，还是不治病呢？在我一再婉言恳求之下，这位同志终于答应把我在第二医院照的爱克斯光胸部照片拿来看一下。
    八月八日，我坐到结核病防治所的诊查室里了。
    大夫：“你现在是整日工作，还是半日工作。”
    我说：“我原来是离职准备考学校的功课的，现在还没工作。不过，在第二医院检查，肺部没有病。”
    “可是根据我们的检查，你患有浸润型肺结核。”
    “可是在第二医院照了爱克斯光胸部照片，也看不出有病。”
    “也许已经好了。”
    “怎么？这样的病在一两个星期之内不治也会好吗？”
    “因为这种病是属于一过性的。”
    “什么叫一过性的？”
    “呃呃，就是肺部的发炎或一时的细菌感染……”
    “肺部发炎或一时的细菌感染，是和浸润型肺结核属于一种类型的吗？”
    “是的，可以这样说。”
    “为什么能够说它们是属于同一类型的呢？”
    “那是因为当时招生委员会要的太急，没有时间再进行复查。”
    瞧，他把话岔到哪儿去啦？这个回答和是否“属于同一类型”有什么逻辑关系呢？不过，他既然提到复查，我也就接下去：“其实是有时间进行复查的。我要求复查，可你们说不必要。”
    “根据我们的检查，你得的就是浸润型肺结核。”
    “那么可不可以和第二医院照的爱克斯光照片对照研究一下呢？”
    “用不着。根据我们的检查，你得的就是浸润型肺结核。”他像留声机一样地重复着。我发现：他的呼吸突然急促起来，脖子上也分明地涨起了几道红筋，这就是说，大夫发火了。大概这位大夫是把我的意思误会了，他一定以为我是在追究责任。其实，我只不过希望两个医院的诊断意见统一起来，有病，我就治病；没有病，我也好向原机关作个交代，重新工作。我把这个意思告诉了他。显然有效，他的呼吸逐渐平静下来了，也答应了把第二医院的照片拿来对照研究一下。至于时间呢，要到八月十八日才能见出“分晓”。
    八月十八日，我又坐在结核病防治所的诊查室里了。这次是另一位大夫接待我的。
    “你现在是整日工作，还是半日工作？”
    “我原来是离职准备考学校的功课的，现在还没有工作。不过，在第二医院检查，肺部没有病。”
    “可是根据我们的检查……”
    谈话几乎是上次的翻版，就像录音机录下来的一样。不过这位大夫在我的要求之下，终于把手边放着的我的“病历”翻了翻，结果发现：根据同第二医院所照的照片对照研究的结果，肺部没有病！大夫不作声了。
    到这里，我这场“病”就算好了。四十多天来，我才有机会轻松地喘一口气。我不要同大家隔离了。我可以坦然地走进集体食堂用饭了，我也可以取下口罩，无顾忌地同同志们面对面地说话了。一个健康的人是多么幸福啊！
    感谢中央直属机关结核病防治所的那两位大夫，他们总算使我——一个志愿当医生的人在考入学校之前，就知道了作医生应该怎样，不应该怎样。
