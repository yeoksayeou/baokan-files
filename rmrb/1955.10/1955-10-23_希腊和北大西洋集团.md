Greece and the North Atlantic Group
Hu Sisheng

Recently, Greek public opinion has strongly condemned the arrogant stance of the major powers in the North Atlantic Group, especially the United States and Britain, for putting pressure on Greece, forcing it to abandon its national aspirations, and insulting it. Under these circumstances, the Greek government announced that it would refuse to participate in the upcoming autumn exercises of the North Atlantic Group's armed forces and would not participate in the International Monetary Fund meeting and other meetings held in Turkey. Western newspapers have described this attitude taken by Greece as a "dangerous crack" in the North Atlantic Group. This evolution of relations between Greece and the major powers of the North Atlantic Group cannot but attract people's attention.

This inevitably involves the Cyprus issue and the tripartite British, Greek, and Turkish conference held in London not long ago on this issue. This conference was not in line with the wishes of the people of Cyprus; it did not have representatives of the Cypriot people participating. Moreover, the demand made by the Greek representative at the conference to grant the Cypriot people the right to self-determination was rejected by Britain and Turkey. Turkey also tried its best at the meeting to help Britain threaten Greece. A spokesman for the Turkish delegation openly stated: If Greece insists on demanding the right to self-determination for the people of Cyprus, the Turkish-Greek alliance may be seriously jeopardized.

In order to put pressure on Greece, anti-Greek riots were created in Istanbul and Izmir, Turkey, on the eve of the end of the London conference. Greek expatriates in Turkey were beaten and massacred, and Greek homes, shops, churches, and even the Greek consulate in Izmir were looted and destroyed. According to preliminary newspaper estimates, the loss of Greek property as a result of the anti-Greek riots in various Turkish cities amounted to 500 million U.S. dollars. The background of these purposeful activities is self-evident. Kavaleratos, Chargé d'Affaires of the Greek Embassy in the United States, said at a press conference in Washington that his government had received "definite indications" that Britain had "instigated" the Turks against Greece.

These things most clearly illustrate the position of small countries in the North Atlantic Group. The principle in that group is that the interests of small countries must be subordinate to the interests of big countries, and small countries can only be manipulated by big countries. At the London conference, Britain used the strategic importance of its military bases in Cyprus to the North Atlantic Group as an excuse to force Greece to agree to Britain's continued colonial rule over Cyprus. And the reason why Greece suffered insults and rebukes was precisely because it did not abandon its national aspirations according to the will of the major powers of the North Atlantic Group. This completely exposed the lie that the North Atlantic Group is a "free and voluntary alliance." Facts have proved that it is completely incompatible with the national rights of its member states. This situation naturally cannot but arouse the indignation of people from all walks of life in Greece. Former Greek Foreign Minister Venizelos said: "It seems that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization grants the rights of masters to certain countries and imposes the obligations of slaves on other countries." Archbishop Spyridon of Athens and all of Greece openly condemned these events as reflecting "the interests, hypocrisy, and betrayal of the great powers."

It is worth noting the role played by the United States, which claims to be the leader of the North Atlantic Group, in these matters. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles wrote a letter to the Greek Prime Minister on September 18, blatantly ordering Greece to stop arguing with Turkey in a threatening tone, and to accept British rule over Cyprus in order to "restore" the "unity" of the North Atlantic Group "without delay." Dulles also implied in the letter that if Greece continued to argue with Turkey, the United States would consider stopping "aid" to Greece. That is to say, Greece must accept the will imposed on it by the major powers in the North Atlantic Group and endure the damage to its national interests, and this is the price Greece should pay for the "unity" of the North Atlantic Group. As the "New York Times" reported, this cannot but make "the Greeks feel as if they have been beaten for no reason, and then treated the same as the thugs who committed the crime." A Greek newspaper criticized Dulles' attitude, saying: This "is a repulsive and unacceptable practice, both shamelessly and wickedly distorting the truth, and an arrogant and rude act against an honest nation."

The facts ruthlessly show that Greece's national aspirations not only do not receive any sympathy from the major powers of the North Atlantic Group, but are instead brutally suppressed. Thus, Greece's decision to submit the Cyprus issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion is obviously very reasonable. However, this practice of Greece was again obstructed and opposed by its North Atlantic Group allies, primarily Britain and the United States. They unreasonably demanded that Greece withdraw its reasonable demands to the UN. After Greece refused to withdraw its complaint to the UN, the North Atlantic countries united to obstruct the inclusion of the Cyprus issue on the agenda. The Greek proposal was finally rejected by the "majority" gathered by these countries. The Greeks drew a proper conclusion from this event. The Greek newspaper "Daily News" wrote: "Due to the savage pressure of the United States, the spirit of freedom has been trampled on at the United Nations." The newspaper also said: "The so-called defenders of freedom have become despicable in the eyes of respectable people... If the British have long ceased to be our allies, then the Americans must be told that they can no longer expect the friendship of Greece." The Greek public naturally raised the question: What exactly does the so-called "unity of the North Atlantic Alliance" mean? When all the member states of the North Atlantic Group in the United Nations stand in opposition to Greece, Greece receives sympathy and support from countries outside the North Atlantic Group. No wonder former Greek Foreign Minister Venizelos asked: Is Greece's security fully guaranteed by adopting an absolute policy of alliance with the West? The iron facts have given a negative answer.

Even more strangely, when Greece voted in the United Nations General Assembly in favor of including the Algerian issue on the agenda, this even provoked reprimands from the colonial countries of the North Atlantic Group. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak threatened that the leadership of the Atlantic Group would discuss the issue of Greece and Iceland (note: Iceland abstained in the vote), these two "rebellious" countries. The "New York Times" criticized Greece for "possibly violating the North Atlantic Treaty." This means that as a member of the North Atlantic Group, Greece is not only unable to defend its own national aspirations, but is even prohibited from taking an upright stance when discussing other issues. This experience of Greece typically illustrates the treatment that a small country can receive in the North Atlantic Group. Therefore, is it not natural for Greek public opinion to demand a re-evaluation of the policy of participating in the North Atlantic Group?

Recently, the call for an independent and autonomous policy in Greece has reached an unprecedented high. The first meeting of Greek Friends of Peace, organized by the Greek Committee for Easing International Tensions and Striving for Peace, with the participation of more than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life, passed a resolution saying: "Some recent events in the eastern Mediterranean have made Greeks believe that Greece's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization threatens its independence and cause of peace. In order to protect its own interests, Greece should become a factor for peace. Greece should not join any group, but should firmly maintain friendly relations with all countries that are prepared to respect Greek independence and territorial integrity." The Greek "Evening News" also wrote: "We should leave the path we have taken until now, because this path will deceive us. Now there is a broad road—the road of friendship with all countries. Many countries such as Austria, Yugoslavia, Egypt, the Arab countries, and India are taking this road. Why doesn't Greece take this road? If we take this road, we will be respected by all countries."

It should be said that these propositions reflect the wishes of the broad masses of the Greek people. It is very clear that if Greece pursues an independent policy, it will be possible to safeguard its own national interests and improve its international status.

    希腊和北大西洋集团
    胡思升
    近来，希腊舆论强烈谴责北大西洋集团中的大国，特别是美国和英国对希腊施加压力、迫使它放弃民族愿望并加以侮辱的骄横立场。在这种情况下，希腊政府宣布拒绝参加北大西洋集团武装部队即将举行的秋季演习，并不参加在土耳其举行的国际货币基金组织会议和其他会议。西方国家的报纸把希腊所采取的这种态度形容成为北大西洋集团的“危险的裂痕”。希腊和北大西洋集团大国之间的关系的这种演变不能不引起人们的注意。
    这就必须涉及到塞浦路斯问题和不久前在伦敦就这一问题召开的英、希、土三国会议。这个会议是不符合于塞浦路斯人民的愿望的；它没有塞浦路斯人民的代表参加。而且希腊代表在这个会议上提出的给予塞浦路斯人民以自决权利的要求，也为英国和土耳其所拒绝。土耳其并在会议中竭力帮助英国对希腊进行威胁。土耳其出席会议代表团的发言人公开说过：如果希腊坚持给塞浦路斯人民自决权利的要求，希土联盟可能受到严重危害。
    为了对希腊施加压力，在伦敦会议结束的前夕，在土耳其伊斯坦布尔和伊兹密尔等地制造了反希腊的骚动，在土耳其的希腊侨民遭到殴打和屠杀，希腊人的住宅、商店、教堂，甚至伊兹密尔的希腊领事馆都被抢劫和捣毁。据报纸初步估计，土耳其各城市发生反希腊骚动的结果，希腊财产损失达五亿美元。这些有目的的活动的背景是不言自明的。希腊驻美大使馆代办卡瓦莱拉托在华盛顿记者招待会上说，他的政府得到了“确实的迹象”，表明英国“煽动”土耳其人反对希腊。
    这些事情最清楚不过地说明，在北大西洋集团中小国是处于一种什么样的地位。在那个集团里的原则就是小国的利益必须服从大国的利益，小国只能任由大国摆布。在伦敦会议上，英国就是以英国在塞浦路斯的军事基地对北大西洋集团在战略上的重要性作为借口，来迫使希腊同意英国继续保持它对塞浦路斯的殖民统治。而希腊所以遭受到侮辱和申斥，也正是因它没有按照北大西洋集团大国的意志，放弃它的民族愿望。这就彻底戳穿了所谓北大西洋集团是“一个自由和自愿联盟”的鬼话，事实证明它同各成员国的民族权利是毫不相容的。这种情况自然不能不激起希腊各界人士的愤慨。希腊前外交大臣维尼齐洛斯就说：“好像北大西洋公约组织以主宰者的权利给予某些国家，并且以奴隶的义务强加在另外一些国家身上。”雅典和全希腊大主教斯皮利顿并公开谴责这些事情反映了“大国的利益、伪善和背信”。
    值得注意的是以北大西洋集团盟主自居的美国在这些事情当中所扮演的角色。美国国务卿杜勒斯九月十八日写信给希腊首相，公然以威胁的口吻勒令希腊停止同土耳其的争吵，要希腊接受英国对塞浦路斯的统治，以便“毫不迟延地恢复”北大西洋集团的“团结”。杜勒斯并在信件中暗示，如果希腊继续同土耳其争吵，美国就要考虑停止对希腊的“援助”。这就是说，希腊必须接受北大西洋集团中的大国强加于它的意志，忍受它的民族利益遭到损害，而这就是希腊为了北大西洋集团的“团结”所应该付出的代价。正如“纽约时报”的报道所说的，这不能不使“希腊人觉得好像无故被人打了一顿之后，竟被人同行凶的暴徒同样看待。”一家希腊报纸抨击杜勒斯的态度说：这“是一种令人起反感和不能接受的作法，既无耻、罪恶地歪曲真相，而且又是对一个诚实的民族的傲慢无礼的行为。”
    事实无情地显示：希腊的民族愿望不仅得不到北大西洋集团的大国的任何同情，相反地还遭到了粗暴的压制。这样，希腊决定把塞浦路斯问题提交联合国大会讨论，这显然是十分合理的。但是希腊的这种做法，又遭到它的北大西洋集团的盟国，首先是英国和美国的阻挠和反对。它们蛮横地要希腊撤回它向联大提出的合理要求。在希腊拒绝撤回它向联大的控诉之后，北大西洋国家就联合起来阻挠把塞浦路斯问题列入议程。希腊的提案终于被这些国家所纠集的“多数”否决了。希腊人从这个事件得出了正当的结论。希腊报纸“每日新闻”就写道：“由于美国野蛮的压力，自由的精神在联合国遭到了蹂躏。”这家报纸并且说：“所谓的自由保卫者在可尊敬的人们看来已经低贱不堪了……假如说英国人在很久以前就不再是我们的盟友的话，那么必须告诉美国人，他们也不再能指望希腊的友谊。”希腊公众自然地提出了这个问题：所谓“北大西洋联盟的团结”，究竟意味着什么？当在联合国中所有北大西洋集团的成员国都和希腊站在对立的地位的时候，希腊却从北大西洋集团以外的国家那里得到了同情和支持。怪不得希腊前外交大臣维尼齐洛斯问道：采取同西方缔结联盟的绝对方针，希腊的安全是否会得到充分的保证呢？铁的事实已作了否定的答复。
    更奇怪的是，当希腊在联合国大会中投票赞成把阿尔及利亚问题列入议程的时候，这也竟然惹起了北大西洋集团殖民国家的叱责。比利时外交大臣斯巴克威胁说：大西洋集团领导机构将讨论希腊和冰岛（按：冰岛在投票时弃权）这两个“抗命者”的问题。“纽约时报”斥责希腊“可能违背了北大西洋公约”。这意味着希腊作为一个北大西洋集团的成员国，它不但不能维护它自己的民族愿望，甚至在讨论其他问题时，也被禁止采取正直的立场。希腊的这种遭遇典型地说明了一个小国在北大西洋集团中所能得到的待遇。因此希腊舆论要求重新估价参加北大西洋集团的政策，不是很自然的吗？
    最近希腊国内要求奉行独立自主政策的呼声空前高涨。由希腊争取缓和国际紧张局势和争取和平委员会组织的由各阶层代表一千多人参加的希腊和平之友第一次会议通过决议说：“地中海东部最近发生的一些事件使得希腊人相信：希腊参加北大西洋公约组织这件事使得自己的独立和和平事业受到了威胁。希腊为了保护自己的利益，应当成为和平的因素。希腊不应当加入任何一个集团，而应当坚决同所有准备尊重希腊独立和领土完整的国家保持友好。”希腊“新闻晚报”也写道：“我们应该离开直到现在我们所走的道路，因为这条道路将会使我们受骗。现在有着一条宽广的道路——同所有国家友好的道路。像奥地利、南斯拉夫、埃及、阿拉伯国家以及印度这许多国家都在走这条道路。为什么希腊不走这条道路呢？如果我们走这条道路，我们就将受到所有国家的尊重。
    应该说，这些主张是反映了希腊广大人民的愿望的。十分明显，希腊如果执行独立的政策，它就有可能维护自己的民族利益，有可能提高自己的国际地位。
