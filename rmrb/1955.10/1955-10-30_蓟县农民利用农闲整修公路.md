    Jixian County Farmers Use Slack Season to Repair Highways

    The broad masses of farmers in Jixian County, Hebei Province, have achieved great success in repairing highways by utilizing the slack season. From 1951 to 1954, they repaired thirteen highways and constructed one hundred and fifty-four medium and small-sized bridges and culverts. They reduced the original 60% gradient of Daling to 8.5%, and raised the roadbeds of highways on the plains. More than 130,000 trees were planted along the main lines, and the trees now provide shade on several major routes. At present, the county has more than 260 kilometers of highways passable by automobiles. All thirteen districts and one district-level town in the county, except for the Twelfth District which will be completed this autumn, have highways.

    Due to the repair and restoration of highways, the highway transportation industry has also developed. Now, in the deep mountains, people can not only buy daily necessities, but also fruit farmers can sell their produce to cooperatives, preventing spoilage due to inconvenient transportation.

    The farmers of Jixian County, having personally experienced the benefits of highway construction, not only actively participate in road construction work, but also automatically organize to maintain the highways after they are built. A total of 139 road protection villages have been established, with 650 people participating as regular road maintenance workers. Farmers also use gaps in their time in the fields to maintain the highways.

    蓟县农民利用农闲整修公路
    河北省蓟县广大农民利用农闲季节整修公路，获得很大成绩。自一九五一年到一九五四年四年来，共整修了十三条公路，修建了中小型桥涵一百五十四座。把原来大岭百分之六十的坡度，降低到百分之八点五；平原上的公路都加高了路基。并在干线上植树十三万多株，现在在几条主要路线上已绿树成荫。目前全县已有可通汽车公路二百六十多公里。全县十三个区、一个区级镇，除十二区可在今年秋后修成通车外，其他区、镇都有了公路。
    由于公路的整修恢复，公路运输事业也就跟着发展了。现在在深山里不仅能买到生活日用品，而且，果农生产的果品也能卖给合作社，不致因为交通不便而发生霉烂了。
    蓟县的农民由于亲身体会到修建公路对自己的好处，不但积极参加修建道路的工作；在公路修建起来后，还自动组织起来养护公路。共建立了一百三十九个护路村，参加经常性的养路员有六百五十人。农民们并且还利用下田的空隙进行养护公路。
