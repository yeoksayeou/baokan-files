Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th. The first generator unit of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station, the second largest hydroelectric station on the Dnieper River in the Soviet Union, started generating electricity on October 18th this year, a year ahead of schedule. This is a significant victory for the builders of the hydroelectric station. They are now continuing their efforts to complete the construction of this hydraulic hub entirely in the first half of 1956, enabling the other four generator units to generate electricity ahead of schedule as well.

The Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station is one of the power centers for improving the economic situation in southern Ukraine. It, together with the Dnieper Lenin Hydroelectric Power Station and the Tsimlyansk Hydroelectric Power Station, already constitutes a unified power system.

This hydroelectric station is built on the Dnieper River near the city of Kakhovka. More than five years ago, this was still a muddy swamp, but now majestic dams, navigation locks, power plant buildings, and spillway dams have been erected. Now, the water of the Dnieper River, blocked by the dam of the hydroelectric station, is rising day by day. The waves of the artificial reservoir "Kakhovka Sea", which can store 14 billion cubic meters of water, have already risen all the way to Zaporozhye, more than 240 kilometers away from New Kakhovka.

The water of the reservoir has already driven the first generator unit. According to the original plan, when the hydroelectric station is fully completed, its power generation capacity will be 250,000 kilowatts. However, during the design and construction process, the builders increased its power generation capacity by one-fifth. In normal water level years, its total power generation can reach 1.4 billion kilowatt-hours per year, which is 200 million kilowatt-hours more than previously stipulated. At that time, about 500 collective farms, 120 machine tractor stations, and state farms in Kherson Oblast and Nikolaev Oblast will receive a full supply of electricity, ensuring the electrification of agriculture and promoting the establishment of a permanent feed base for the development of public animal husbandry. Many industrial enterprises will also obtain cheap electricity.

The water from the artificial reservoir "Kakhovka Sea" will also irrigate 1.5 million hectares of land. If we add the South Ukraine and North Crimea canals, which are being built at the same time, they will bring stable harvests to arid land equivalent to the entire area of the Netherlands.

In addition to power generation and irrigation, the Kakhovka hydraulic project can also greatly improve navigation throughout the lower reaches of the Dnieper River south of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, making the entire Dnieper River navigable.

### 苏联卡霍夫卡水电站开始发电

    苏联卡霍夫卡水电站开始发电
    新华社莫斯科十九日电　苏联第聂伯河上第二个最大的水电站——卡霍夫卡水电站的第一台联动机已经比原定计划提前一年而在今年十月十八日开始发电了。这是水电站建设者的重大胜利。目前他们正继续努力，争取在一九五六年上半年全部完成这个水力枢纽的建设工程，使其他四座联动机也提前发电。
    卡霍夫卡水电站是改善乌克兰南部经济状况的动力中心之一。现在它和第聂伯列宁水电站和齐姆良水电站已经构成了一个统一的电力系统。
    这个水电站建筑在第聂伯河上卡霍夫卡城附近，五年多以前这里还是一片泥泞的沼泽，现在已经树立起雄伟的拦河坝、通航水闸、发电厂厂房和溢流坝。现在，被水电站的堤坝堵住的第聂伯河的河水，一天天在升高。能够储水一百四十亿立方公尺的人工水库“卡霍夫卡海”的波涛，已经一直涨到距离新卡霍夫卡二百四十多公里的萨坡罗什。
    水库的水已经推动了第一台联动机。按原定计划，当水电站全部落成的时候，水电站的发电能力是二十五万瓩，但是在设计和建设的过程中建筑者们把它的发电能力增加了五分之一，在水位正常年份它的总发电量可以达到一年十四亿瓩时，即比以前规定的多两亿瓩时。到那时，刻松州和尼古拉耶夫州的约五百个集体农庄、一百二十个机器拖拉机站和国营农场将得到充分的电力供应，保证农业的电气化，并且促进发展公共畜牧业的永久的饲料基地的建立。许多工业企业也将获得便宜的电力。
    人工水库“卡霍夫卡海”的水还将灌溉一百五十万公顷的土地。如果加上和它同时兴修的南乌克兰和北克里米亚两条运河，它们将给相当于荷兰全国面积的干旱土地带来稳固的丰收。
    除了发电和灌溉以外，卡霍夫卡水力工程还可以大大改善从第聂伯水电站以南第聂伯河整个下游的航运，使整个第聂伯河都能通航。
