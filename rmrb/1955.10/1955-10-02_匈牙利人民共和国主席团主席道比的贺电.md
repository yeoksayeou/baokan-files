To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China:

    On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, I extend warm greetings to the great Chinese people and to you personally, Comrade Chairman. The Chinese people have achieved brilliant successes in the short span of six years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, which have won the sincere admiration and praise of peace-loving people of all countries. I wish the fraternal Chinese people further achievements in their victorious creative work, in standing side by side with the Soviet Union, and in their heroic struggle for world peace together with peace-loving countries.

                  István Dobi
                  President of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic
