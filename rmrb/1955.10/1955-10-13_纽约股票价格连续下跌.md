Xinhua News Agency, New York, 12th: New York stock prices have fallen three times in less than half a month. After experiencing the second most severe drop in history on September 26th, New York stock prices fell again on October 3rd. After these two declines, stock prices had rebounded. However, on October 10th, a third decline occurred, and the downward trend continued on the 11th. According to the Associated Press, apart from the decline on September 26th, the most recent drop was the largest price drop since the sharp commercial decline after World War II, which occurred on September 3rd, 1946. This single price drop caused the market value of securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange to fall by five billion US dollars. During this period, stocks of large monopoly companies such as automobiles, steel, mining, airplanes, and railways were all falling.

As of the 11th, the average price of 60 stocks compiled by the Associated Press was 163.4 US dollars, which was 18.1 US dollars per share lower than the highest price reached this year.

The American "Workers Daily" pointed out in its editorial on October 2nd that the decline in stock prices reflects the unstable nature of the American economy. It said that the current American economy is built on the basis of installment sales. Consumer debt has risen to an unprecedented level of 33 billion US dollars, housing mortgage debt has reached 83 billion US dollars, while workers' wages and farmers' income are insufficient to repay these debts, and farmers' income has declined significantly. The "Workers Daily" pointed out that many American financial commentators are worried about the continuous decline in stock prices, believing that this will affect a large reduction in investment in new factories and equipment by industry and commerce, resulting in a significant increase in unemployment.

    纽约股票价格连续下跌
    新华社十二日讯　纽约消息：纽约的股票价格在不到半个月的时间内，发生了三次下跌。纽约股票价格自九月二十六日发生历史上第二次的惨重的下跌之后，接着在十月三日又发生下跌。在这两次下跌以后，股票价格曾经回升。但是到十月十日，又出现第三次下跌，下跌的趋势，在十一日还在继续中。据美联社报道，除九月二十六日的下跌以外，最近的一次下跌，是一九四六年九月三日发生的、第二次世界大战结束后的一次商业急剧下降以来的最大的跌价。单是这一次跌价，使纽约股票交易所挂牌的证券市价跌了五十亿美元。在这一期间，汽车、钢铁、采矿、飞机、铁路等大垄断公司的股票都在下跌。
    到十一日为止，美联社统计的六十种股票的平均价格为一百六十三点四美元，比今年曾经达到的最高价格每股下跌了十八点一美元之多。
    美国“工人日报”在十月二日的社论中指出，股票价格的下跌，反映了美国经济的不稳性质。它说，目前美国的经济是建立在用分期付款销售的基础之上的。消费者债务上升到三百三十亿美元的空前水平，房屋抵押债务已经达到八百三十亿美元，而工人工资和农民收入，不足以偿付这些债务，而且农民的收入已经显著下降。“工人日报”指出，许多美国金融评论员都对股票价格接连下跌表示担心，他们认为这将会影响工商业大量减少对新工厂和装备的投资，结果会造成失业大大增加。
