Fujian Scented Tea Transported and Sold Across the Country

　　A large quantity of various types of scented tea produced in Fujian Province this year has already been transported to other regions. By the end of August, over 24,000 dan of jasmine tea, pomelo flower tea, and other varieties had been shipped out, an increase of 8 percent compared to the same period in 1954. Currently, it is the peak season for scented tea production in Fujian Province. The Fuzhou Tea Factory of the China Tea Corporation and other factories are intensifying their tea production efforts. It is estimated that the scented tea output of this tea factory will increase by approximately 14 percent compared to 1954.

　　Fujian Province is rich in fragrant flowers such as jasmine, magnolia, pomelo, and Michelia alba, with an annual output of over 25,000 dan. These flowers are excellent fragrances for making scented tea. Fujian's scented tea has consistently sold well in North China, Northeast China, and other regions, with some of it also being exported to Hong Kong and Macau.

    福建花茶运销各地
    福建省今年制的各类花茶，已经有大批运往外地。到八月底，运出的茉莉花茶、柚子花茶等，共有二万四千多担，比一九五四年同时期增加百分之八。目前，正是福建省花茶生产的旺季。中国茶业公司福州茶厂等正加紧进行制茶工作。据估计，今年这个茶厂的花茶产量，将比一九五四年增加百分之十四左右。
    福建省盛产茉莉、玉兰、柚子、木兰等香花，年产量约有二万五千多担。这些花都是制花茶的好香料。福建的花茶历年畅销华北、东北等地，部分花茶还运销香港、澳门。
