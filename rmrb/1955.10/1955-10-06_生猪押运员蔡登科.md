    Livestock Escort Cai Dengke
    Liu Guangzhi

    Cai Dengke, a livestock escort from the Huaiyin Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Food Company, escorted pigs from Huaiyin to Zhenjiang 145 times from April 1953 to the end of August this year, a total of 23,179 pigs, without a single death. As a result, he has been repeatedly named an outstanding worker of the Huaiyin Branch.

    Comrade Cai Dengke has a very serious attitude towards his work. Every time he is about to load pigs onto the ship, he always checks first to see if the necessary equipment on the deck is ready and whether it has been disinfected. When loading the ship, he pays attention to checking whether there are any sick pigs being loaded. When the ship starts, he also pays attention to preventing the ship's whistle from startling the pigs. When it is hot in summer, he first uses a watering can to sprinkle water in the hold before the pigs are loaded, and then sprinkles it again after loading. He also regularly washes away the pig manure to keep the hold clean. When it is cold in winter, he checks the rain and wind protection equipment on the ship and prepares for the work, so as not to let the pigs freeze. The characteristics of Huaiyin pigs are that they are impatient and like to jump around. Cai Dengke has mastered this characteristic and uses the method of "gentle shouting" and "nudging while shouting" to disperse the pigs, avoiding the pigs from crowding together, biting each other, causing injuries and casualties, and causing ship accidents.

    During the escort, he also feeds the pigs twice a day. He also adjusts the taste of the feed according to seasonal changes so that the pigs like to eat it. For example, he feeds more melons, fruits and wild vegetables at noon in the summer and mixes it with cold water to quench the pigs' thirst; in the winter, he mixes the feed with warm water.

    It takes two days and two nights to transport pigs from Huaiyin to Zhenjiang each time. Cai Dengke rarely rests during the escort. He has to loosen the pen twice every morning and evening, and he has to get up once in the middle of the night to loosen the pen, drive the pigs up to move around, so that the pigs can excrete feces and urine, which is convenient for cleaning and keeping the hold clean. He cherishes the pigs like "treasures" and never kicks or beats them. Because he knows that being able to raise, feed, and escort pigs well is his contribution to socialism.

    生猪押运员蔡登科  
    刘广志
    江苏省食品公司淮阴分公司押运员蔡登科，从一九五三年四月到今年八月底的二十九个月中，从淮阴到镇江押运生猪一百四十五次，共二万三千一百七十九头猪，没有死过一头。因此，他曾几次被评为淮阴分公司的优秀工作者。
    蔡登科同志的工作态度很认真。在每次将要装猪上船的时候，他总是先检查船舱上的一些必要设备是不是已经准备好了，有没有消毒过。在装船时，他就注意检查有没有病猪装上船来。在开船时，他还注意防止轮船汽笛声惊扰生猪。夏天天热时，他在猪未上船前先用喷水壶在船舱内洒一次水，装好后再洒一次，经常冲洗猪粪，保持船舱的清洁；冬天天冷时，他就检查船上防雨防风设备，作好准备工作，不让猪受冻。淮阴生猪的特点是性情急躁，喜欢乱跳乱蹦。蔡登科掌握这一特点，用“轻呼喊”、“边喊边拨”的办法，把猪疏散开，避免生猪拥挤一堆相互咬啮造成伤亡和翻船事故。
    在押运途中，他还每天给猪饲食两次。并根据季节变化，调剂饲料的口味，使猪爱吃。例如夏天中午便多饲瓜果野菜，并用冷水调食，使猪解渴；冬季就用温水调拌饲料。
    从淮阴运猪到镇江每次需两天两夜，蔡登科在押运途中很少休息，每天早晚他都要松舱两次，半夜还要起来松舱一次，把猪赶起来活动活动，使猪排泄大小便，便于打扫，保持船舱清洁。他把生猪当作“宝贝”般的爱护，从来不肯踢打。因为他知道能把猪喂养押运好，就是为社会主义尽了自己的一分力量。
