The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1955, No. 41, has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "The Working People of Capitalist Countries Fight to Satisfy Their Own Urgent Demands." The editorial states that the working people in capitalist countries are more organized and are intensifying their struggle to satisfy their own basic and urgent demands. This just struggle is a regular and unavoidable phenomenon in capitalist societies, which are divided by sharp social contradictions. In France, Britain, Italy, West Germany, Japan, the United States, and other countries, strikes are constantly occurring. The working class in colonies and dependent countries is also intensifying its struggle for its basic rights, freedom, and national independence. The editorial points out that the current struggle of the working class to satisfy its own urgent demands is organically linked to the struggle of all working people for peace and the easing of international tensions. In the struggle for peace and national independence, for bread and democratic freedom, the working class and the peasants form an alliance, and a people's united front led by the working class is also taking shape. That is why united action by the working class is the key to the unity of all patriotic and progressive forces in every country.

Important articles in this issue include Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, "The Relaxation of the International Situation and the Pressure of the People," and Jerzy Tepicht, Alternate Member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, "The Application of Lenin's Cooperative Plan Principles in Poland," etc.

Duclos's article points out that the French government should bear serious responsibility for deciding to postpone the dates of Faure's and Pinay's visit to Moscow. The foreign ministers' meeting is about to be held in Geneva at the end of this month, and the French government made this decision on the eve of the meeting, which reminds the French working class and all the people that they must fight to promote and consolidate the relaxation of the international situation and force the government to ensure that the Geneva meeting promotes the cause of striving for the relaxation of international tensions to achieve victory. The article says: The victory of the cause of striving to ease international tensions depends first and foremost on the efforts of the masses of the people. The responsibility of us Communists is to stand at the forefront of the organizers of this victory. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版一九五五年第四十一期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第四十一期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“资本主义国家的劳动人民争取满足自己的切身要求”为题发表了社论。社论说，资本主义国家的劳动人民已经更有组织，并且在加紧进行斗争，争取满足切身的基本要求。这种正义的斗争在被尖锐的社会矛盾所分裂的资本主义社会中是合乎规律和不可避免的现象。在法国、英国、意大利、西德、日本、美国和其他国家，罢工事件层出不穷。殖民地和附属国的工人阶级也正在加紧斗争，争取自己的基本权利、自由和民族独立。社论指出当前工人阶级争取满足切身要求的斗争，是和全体劳动人民争取和平和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争有机地联系在一起的。在争取和平和民族独立、争取面包和民主自由的斗争中，工人阶级和农民结成联盟，一个以工人阶级为领导力量的人民统一战线也在形成起来。这就是为什么工人阶级采取统一行动是每一个国家全体爱国和进步力量团结一致的关键。
    这一期刊载的重要文章有法国共产党书记雅·杜克洛的“国际局势的缓和与人民的压力”和波兰统一工人党候补中央委员叶·特皮赫特的“列宁合作社计划的原则在波兰的运用”等。
    杜克洛的文章指出，法国政府对决定推迟富尔和比内访问莫斯科的日期一事，应负严重的责任。外长会议即将于本月底在日内瓦举行，而法国政府竟在会议前夕作出这个决定，这提醒了法国工人阶级和全体人民必须进行斗争来促进和巩固国际局势的缓和，强迫政府保证日内瓦会议促进争取国际紧张局势缓和的事业取得胜利。文章说：争取缓和国际紧张局势这一事业的胜利首先要靠人民群众的努力。我们共产党人的责任就是站在这一胜利的组织者的前列。　（新华社）
