    Interview with Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke, Leader of the Japanese Kabuki Troupe
    Our Correspondent

    On the afternoon of October 2nd, as I approached the residence of the Japanese Kabuki Troupe, I heard the melodious sounds of a zither and the rhythmic beating of drums. In front of a spacious bedroom, I saw a group of Japanese Kabuki actors rehearsing indoors. From afar, I saw an old man with white hair seemingly instructing a young actor. I pondered: perhaps like Peking Opera, even though these Japanese classical artists have performed a play for many years and countless times, they are still constantly rehearsing diligently.

    Not long after, the old man came out. We began to converse. This old man was Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke, a member of the Japan Art Academy, the head of the Kabuki-za Theater in Japan, and the most prestigious Kabuki elder in Japan.

    If it weren't for the strands of silver hair on his head, no one would ever guess that he was already sixty-seven years old. He seemed very energetic and robust. When he noticed my surprise, Mr. Ichikawa said meaningfully:

  "For an artist, one should always be young. Wasn't Mr. Mei Lanfang like that too? On stage, I may have to play a role that is eighteen years old, or even younger."

    The first impression I gained from Mr. Ichikawa during our conversation was the long-standing and close relationship between Chinese and Japanese national cultures. Mr. Ichikawa began by saying, "We are extremely happy to come to China to perform this time. I believe that this unique classical art of Japan will be welcomed by the Chinese people. If we perform in other countries, the difficulties may be greater; but the Chinese people will easily understand Kabuki, and they will very much understand our shamisen."

    Mr. Ichikawa continued, "Peking Opera and Kabuki have had a very deep connection since ancient times. Many historical stories passed down from China have been adapted by Japanese playwrights into Kabuki plays. For example, 'Botan Dōrō' (The Peony Lantern), a play depicting love, was transmitted from China and adapted by playwrights in the late Tokugawa period and early Meiji era into Kabuki. This play is still popular throughout Japan. Japanese Kabuki also performs Liangshanbo (Water Margin), Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and Journey to the West." Mr. Ichikawa told me that he himself had played roles like Li Kui the Black Whirlwind and Lu Zhishen the Flowery Monk, characters well-known to the Chinese people.

    Mr. Ichikawa expressed gratitude to the Chinese people for their hospitality to his troupe. He said, "The Chinese people have made thorough arrangements for our performances." He mentioned that the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe will also perform in Japan next year. He said, "Peking Opera and Kabuki have many similarities. If our performances in China are successful, then Peking Opera will also be equally successful in Japan."

    When the reporter asked about the significance of the Japanese Kabuki Troupe's visit to China and the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe's visit to Japan next year, Mr. Ichikawa said, "Of course, such exchanges will help the friendship between the two peoples. It will definitely help. It would be a lie to say it wouldn't." With that, Mr. Ichikawa laughed. He said, "I don't know much about political matters. But I know that art is loved by everyone, and everyone welcomes it. Since everyone likes it, of course, it can promote friendship!"

    This old Japanese artist believes that artistic exchange should not be limited by national boundaries. The excellent art of every nation will be loved and welcomed by audiences all over the world. Therefore, the strengths of art in every nation should be worth learning. He emphasized more than once, "Art is always better than war." He said, "The common demand of mankind is peace, is art."

    From Mr. Ichikawa's conversation, one can understand his passion for Japanese art and his meticulous spirit. From his grandfather to his grandson, five generations have been engaged in Kabuki. He himself has had sixty years of stage experience. In the 25th year of Meiji in Japan, when he was only five years old, he had already begun to perform on stage.

    Mr. Ichikawa said, "Kabuki is an art with ancient national traditions. It has been painstakingly nurtured and grown with the hard work and efforts of countless actors and playwrights. Kabuki originated from the Japanese people, its roots are in the folk. Successive governments have never supported its development, but the Japanese people love Kabuki. In Japanese history, there have been times when some people wanted to destroy Kabuki. But Kabuki cannot be destroyed. When it is persecuted, there are those brave actors who step forward, one after another, to revive it."

    Mr. Ichikawa's words have profound meaning. Especially at a time when the decadent and degenerate colonial culture of the United States is rampant in Japan, destroying Japanese national culture and poisoning the minds of the Japanese people, the Japanese people love Kabuki even more. Therefore, outstanding Kabuki artists like Mr. Ichikawa are even more respected and loved by the Japanese people.

    When mentioning the Chinese classical artist Mei Lanfang, Mr. Ichikawa expressed deep respect. He told the reporter that he learned from magazines that this outstanding Chinese artist had just passed the fifty years of an extraordinary stage life. He said he would very much like to meet Mei Lanfang, because they have experienced common ground on their roads.

    Finally, Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke spoke about attending the National Day celebrations in our country. He said, "I felt as happy and joyful as all the people who participated in the celebrations. I saw many children's smiling faces in the parade. I felt that the children will become good patriots under peaceful education." At this time, the old artist thought of his fifteen-year-old grandson. He said, "I will also educate him to become an excellent actor and patriot."

    访日本歌舞伎剧团座长市川猿之助先生  
    本报记者
    十月二日下午，当我走近日本歌舞伎剧团的住所时，听得琴声悠悠，鼓声咚咚。在一间宽敞的卧室的门前，我看到一群日本歌舞伎的演员们正在室内进行排练。远远地我看见一位白发老人似乎正在指导着一个年轻的演员。我思忖着：也许像京剧一样，尽管那些日本的古典艺术家们曾经把一出戏演出过多少年和多少遍了；但是他们还是在不断地刻苦排练。
    不多一会儿，那位老人走出来了。我们便交谈起来。这位老人就是日本艺术院会员、日本歌舞伎座的座长、日本最负声望的歌舞伎老前辈市川猿之助先生。
    如果不是他头上的绺绺银发，别人决看不出他已有六十七岁的高龄。他看来还是非常精神而健壮。当他发觉我感到惊异时，市川先生意味深长地说：
  “对艺术家来说，应该是永远年青的。梅兰芳先生不也是这样的吗？我在舞台上也许要扮演一个十八岁、甚至还要更年轻一些的角色哩。”
    市川先生在谈话中使我获得的第一个印象，就是中日两国民族文化的悠久的、密切的关系。市川先生一开头就说：“我们这次到中国来演出，使我感到说不尽的高兴。我相信，日本的这种独特的古典艺术一定会得到中国人民的欢迎。如果在其它国家演出，困难也许会多一点；但是中国人民是会容易理解歌舞伎的，他们会非常懂得我们的三弦琴。”
    市川先生继续说：“京剧和歌舞伎从古以来就有很深的姻缘。从中国流传去的许多历史故事经过日本剧作家的改编已成为歌舞伎的剧目了。例如‘牡丹灯笼’这出描写爱情的戏曲就是由中国传来，经过德川末期、明治初年的剧作家们改编成为歌舞伎的，这出戏至今已流行于全日本。日本的歌舞伎也同样演出梁山泊（水浒）、三国志和西游记。”市川先生告诉我说，他自己就曾扮演过像黑旋风李逵和花和尚鲁智深这些为中国人民所熟知的角色。
    市川先生表示感谢中国人民对他的剧团的接待。他说：“中国人民为我们的演出作了周到的安排。”他谈到中国的京剧团也将在明年到日本演出的事情。他说：“京剧和歌舞伎相像的地方很多，如果说，我们在中国演出会得到成功，那么京剧在日本也将会得到同样的成功。”
    当记者问到日本歌舞伎剧团的访华以及来年中国京剧团的访日的意义时，市川先生说：“当然咯，这样的来往会有助于两国人民之间的友谊的。这是一定会有帮助的，如果说没有，那就撒谎了。”说罢，市川先生笑起来。他说：“政治上的事情，我是不太知道的。但是，我知道，艺术人人喜爱，大家都欢迎。既然皆大喜欢，当然就能促进友谊啊！”
    这位日本老艺术家认为，艺术的交流是不应该受国界的限制的。每一个民族的优秀的艺术都会受到全世界公众的喜爱和欢迎。因此，每一个民族的艺术中的长处都应该是值得学习的。他不止一次地强调：“艺术总比战争要好”，他说：“人类的共同要求就是和平，就是艺术。”
    从市川老先生的谈话中，可以知道他对于日本艺术事业的热爱不苟的精神。从他的祖父起直到他的孙儿，五代都从事于歌舞伎的事业。他本人已经有了六十年的舞台生活经历。日本明治二十五年，也就是他还只有五岁的时候，已经开始登台了。
    市川先生说：“歌舞伎是具有古老的民族传统的艺术。它是经过无数演员和剧作家的辛勤努力，用他们的心血一点一滴地灌溉成长的。歌舞伎是从日本民间产生的，根子在民间。历来的政府从来没有支持过它的发展，但是日本人民热爱歌舞伎。在日本的历史中，也有过这样的年代，有人要毁灭歌舞伎。但是歌舞伎是毁灭不了的，当它受到摧残时，就有那些勇敢的演员们前仆后继地使它复兴起来。”
    市川老先生的这番话是有深刻含义的。特别是正当今天美国的腐朽靡烂的殖民文化泛滥于日本，摧毁着日本的民族文化，毒害着日本人民的心灵的时候，日本人民更加热爱着歌舞伎，因此，像市川先生那样杰出的歌舞伎艺术家也就更加受到日本人民的尊敬和爱戴。
    提到中国的古典艺术家梅兰芳时，市川先生表示了深深的敬意。他告诉记者说，他在杂志上知道了这位中国杰出艺术家才度过了不平凡的舞台生活的五十年。他说他很想会见梅兰芳，因为他们经历的道路有着共同的地方。
    最后，市川猿之助先生谈到我国国庆节的观礼。他说：“我和所有参加观礼的人们一样感到高兴和愉快。我在游行行列中看到了许多孩子们的欢笑的脸。我感到孩子们在和平的教养下将成为很好的爱国者。”这时，这位老艺术家联想到了他的十五岁的孙儿。他说：“我也将教养他成为出色的演员和爱国者。”
