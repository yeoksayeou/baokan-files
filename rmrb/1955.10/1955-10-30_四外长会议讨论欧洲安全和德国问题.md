Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, October 29th: The Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States held their second meeting on the afternoon of the 28th. Macmillan presided over the meeting. The meeting began to discuss the first item on the agenda: European security and the German question.

British Foreign Secretary Macmillan spoke first. He first addressed the second part of the issue under discussion. He said that the British delegation believes that free elections should be held in Germany as soon as possible. Macmillan said that at the Berlin Conference, we had already clarified our views in a document called the "Eden Plan." This plan stipulates that a pan-German conference must be convened promptly after the elections. The primary task of this conference is to formulate a constitution for the new Germany. After this constitution is passed, a pan-German government will be established immediately on its basis. The powers of the Federal Government and the "East German authorities" (the government of the German Democratic Republic - Editor's note by TASS) will be gradually transferred to the new government until the Federal Republic of Germany and "East Germany" can cease to exist as separate entities.

Macmillan then reminded that, according to the "Eden Plan," the pan-German government should have the freedom to decide domestic policies and the right to freely accept or reject all international obligations undertaken by the former Federal Republic and "East Germany" according to its own wishes. According to this plan, in the transitional period between holding free elections and signing a peace treaty, the former occupying powers should retain their rights regarding the stationing of troops, Berlin, issues concerning the whole of Germany, and the signing of a peace treaty.

Macmillan then said that he was very pleased to hear Molotov's statement on the 27th that the Germans themselves should organize the work of restoring their unity. Macmillan said that there is only one possibility for restoring unity, which is to hold free elections. He said that the delegations of Britain, France, and the United States have put forward their suggestions for this purpose. The main purpose of this suggestion is to make the Soviet Union feel secure and enable it to agree to the restoration of German unity.

Macmillan then read out the full text of the three countries' proposal.

The title of the proposal submitted by the French, British, and American governments on the first item on the agenda is "Restoring German Unity and Security." The proposal states that free elections leading to the establishment of a unified pan-German government are the correct path to ensuring the full participation of the German people in resolving the German question. Judging from the Soviet government's statement, it also hopes to do so. If an agreement in principle is reached at the current meeting, it will be possible to resolve the issues related to electoral law and election supervision as quickly as possible. Such elections could be held in 1956.

The Western three governments also pointed out in their proposal that they "do not intend to join the European security system because, according to the Soviet proposal at the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference, this system cannot end the division of Germany."

The Western three countries reiterated the argument that the Atlantic Group and the Western European Union are only "purely defensive organizations," and "if a unified Germany decides to join these two organizations, the restrictions and supervision imposed by these two organizations will certainly strengthen the security of the Soviet Union, rather than weaken it."

The proposal said: "Nevertheless, in order to eliminate any possible reasons for the Soviet Union to refuse the rapid unification of Germany, the governments of France, Britain, and the United States intend to continue to consider the concerns expressed by the Soviet government." For this purpose, the Western three governments suggested that a "treaty containing special guarantees after the restoration of German unity" be concluded at the same time as the treaty on the unification of Germany is concluded according to the "Eden Plan". This guarantee treaty "will finally come into effect when the unified Germany decides to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union." From this, it can be seen that the Western three countries' proposal stipulates that a unified Germany must join the Western military bloc, regardless of whether the German people are willing to do so or not.

The Western three governments' proposal also included two documents: "Draft Treaty on Special Guarantees After the Restoration of German Unity" and "Plan for the Free Restoration of German Unity (Eden Plan)".

The draft guarantee treaty, which is concluded at the same time as the agreement on the restoration of German unity based on the Eden Plan, stipulates: "No use of force," each party undertakes the obligation to "not provide military or economic assistance to any aggressor," and determines the level of armed forces "in areas of similar size, depth, and importance on both sides of the demarcation line between unified Germany and Eastern European countries" in order to "form a military balance, thereby contributing to European security and reducing the burden of armaments."

The article on "the right to individual and collective self-defense" in the draft actually leaves the possibility for Western countries to maintain their bases on foreign territories.

Regarding joint actions to prevent aggression, according to the draft, it is limited to "consultations between the parties to fulfill the treaty."

The draft stipulates that the treaty provisions will come into effect "gradually in accordance with mutually agreed stages."

The draft of the so-called "Plan for the Free Restoration of German Unity (Eden Plan)" pointed out that the issue of the reunification of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with unified Germany through free negotiations should be resolved in the following stages: 1. Free elections throughout Germany; 2. Convening a National Assembly based on the election results; 3. Drafting a constitution (draft) and preparing for negotiations on concluding a peace treaty; 4. Adopting the constitution and establishing a pan-German government responsible for negotiating and concluding a peace treaty; 5. Signing and entry into force of the peace treaty.

The draft stipulates that an electoral law should be drafted not by the Germans themselves, but by the four countries of France, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States in consultation with German experts and taking into account the electoral laws that have already been drafted for this purpose by the Federal Parliament of the Federal Republic and the People's Chamber of the Soviet-occupied zone. In addition, it stipulates that this electoral law "should be agreed upon by the four countries."

The draft stipulates that foreign countries should supervise the elections. Each supervisory committee should be composed of representatives from the four countries, with or without the participation of representatives from neutral countries, and with the participation of German citizens with the right to speak.

The part of the draft on the methods of preparing for elections pointed out that the four foreign ministers should first reach an agreement on the principles mentioned in the current plan. Subsequently, a working group composed of personnel from the four countries' representative offices in Germany will draft the details on electoral issues.

The draft states that the pan-German government established by the National Assembly should have the freedom to decide whether to accept or reject the international rights and obligations undertaken by the Federal Republic and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. It should also be free to conclude other such international agreements at will.

However, the draft also states that the decisions taken by the National Assembly, the temporary pan-German authorities, and the pan-German government aimed at implementing the Eden Plan do not need to be approved by the four countries. These decisions can only be rejected by a majority vote of the four countries.

The draft finally points out that the peace treaty with Germany should be signed by all countries that have been at war with Germany or their successors. The peace treaty should enter into force upon ratification by the four countries and Germany.

Molotov then spoke on the issue of European security. He presented the Soviet delegation's proposal on the basic principles of a pan-European treaty on collective security for consideration by the meeting. Molotov made some comments on the suggestions put forward by Macmillan on behalf of the Western three countries.

Dulles then spoke. He expressed his agreement with Macmillan's speech. After that, Dulles talked about some of the opinions raised by Molotov, especially Molotov's comments on the military groups of Western countries. Dulles said that these groups are "organizations for collective security."

Dulles acknowledged that the four governments have differences on these issues, and it is probably not possible to resolve all these differences at present. Dulles said that, as far as he understands, Molotov's main objections to the Western three countries' proposal are two: First, the proposal requires Germany to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Second, the sanctions stipulated in the draft treaty only provide for consultation. Dulles said that, according to the Eden Plan, the pan-German government will have ample opportunity to accept or reject suggestions regarding participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or participation in the Brussels Treaty or the Warsaw Treaty. Regarding the sanctions stipulated in the treaty, they—according to Dulles—are far more profound than any other international agreement known to date.

Dulles said that the American delegation would certainly carefully study the Soviet delegation's proposal. He said that at least some of the provisions of the three countries' proposal are consistent with the Soviet delegation's proposal. But there is a fundamental difference in perspective. According to Dulles, this difference lies in the fact that the three countries' proposal deals with closely related issues—the issue of German reunification and the issue of European security, while the Soviet proposal—Dulles insisted—is not related to the issue of German reunification. He said that the American delegation would find it difficult to study the Soviet proposal before studying the proposal on German reunification that, as far as they know, the Soviet delegation would put forward.

Pinay then spoke, saying that he believed that the three countries' proposal was a reasonable basis for negotiation and could lead to an agreement that would enable Germany to be reunited. He said that the French government believes that if a reunited Germany participates in the "Western defense organization," it would guarantee security for everyone.

Pinay said that Western countries have put forward a series of further guarantees to the Soviet Union. He believes that the Western countries' proposal provides an opportunity to start negotiations, and the French delegation will study the Soviet proposal with due attention.

The meeting adjourned after Pinay spoke. The foreign ministers will hold another meeting on the afternoon of the 29th.

### 四外长会议讨论欧洲安全和德国问题

    四外长会议讨论欧洲安全和德国问题
    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：法、英、苏、美四国外长二十八日下午举行第二次会议。由麦克米伦担任主席。会议开始讨论议程的第一项：欧洲安全和德国问题。
    英国外交大臣麦克米伦第一个发言。他首先谈到所讨论的问题的第二部分。他说，英国代表团认为，应该尽快地在德国举行自由选举。麦克米伦说，在柏林会议上，我们已经在名为“艾登计划”的这一文件里阐明了自己的见解。这个计划规定在选举以后，必须从速召开全德会议。这一会议的首要任务是制定新德国的宪法。这个宪法通过之后，立刻在它的基础上成立全德政府。联邦政府和“东德当局”（德意志民主共和国政府——塔斯社编者注）的权力将逐渐移交给新政府，直到德意志联邦共和国和“东德”可以停止作为单独的部分而存在的时候为止。
    麦克米伦接着提醒说，根据“艾登计划”，全德政府应该有决定国内政策的自由，应该有权利按照它自己的愿望自由接受或拒绝前联邦共和国和“东德”所承担的一切国际义务。根据这一计划，在举行自由选举和签订和约之间的过渡时期，前占领国对驻扎军队方面、对柏林、对有关整个德国的问题以及对签订和约应该保留自己的权利。
    麦克米伦接着说，他二十七日十分满意地听取了莫洛托夫所说的这句话：德国人本身应该组织恢复自己统一的工作。麦克米伦说，恢复统一只有一个可能，那就是举行自由选举。他说，英、法、美三国代表团为了这一目的提出了自己的建议。这一建议的主要目的就是使苏联有安全感，并且使它能够同意恢复德国统一。
    随后麦克米伦宣读了三国建议的全文。
    法、英、美三国政府就第一项议程提出的建议的标题是“恢复德国统一和安全”。建议中说，导致建立全德统一政府的自由选举是保证德国人民充分参加解决德国问题的正确道路。从苏联政府的声明来看，它也是希望这样做的。如果在目前的会议上达成了原则上的协议，那末就将有可能尽速地解决有关选举法和监督选举的问题。这种选举在一九五六年就有可能举行。
    西方三国政府还在它们的建议中指出，它们“不打算加入欧洲安全体系，因为，根据苏联在四国政府首脑会议上的建议，这个体系并不能结束德国的分裂”。
    西方三国在建议中重申这种论调：仿佛大西洋集团和西欧联盟只是“纯粹防御性的组织”，“如果统一后的德国决定参加这两个组织，这两个组织所具有的限制和监督一定会加强苏联的安全，而不是削弱苏联的安全。”
    建议说：“虽然如此，为了消除苏联提出拒绝迅速统一德国的任何可能的理由，法国、英国、美国三国政府打算继续考虑苏联政府所表示的不安。”为了这种目的，西方三国政府建议在根据“艾登计划”缔结关于统一德国的条约的同时，缔结一个“包含有在德国恢复统一之后的专门保证的条约”。这个保证条约“将在统一后的德国决定参加北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟时最后生效”。由此可见，西方三国的建议规定统一的德国必须加入西方军事集团，不管德国人民愿意不愿意。
    西方三国政府建议还附有两个文件：“在德国恢复统一之后的专门保证的条约草案”和“自由恢复德国统一的计划（艾登计划）”。
    同以艾登计划为基础的恢复德国统一协定同时缔结的保证条约的草案规定：“不使用武力”，每
  一方承担有“不对任何侵略者给以军事援助和经济援助”的义务，“在包括统一后的德国和东欧国家之间分界线两边的大小、深度、重要性相似的领土的区域中”确定武装部队的水平，以便“形成军事上的均力，从而有助于欧洲安全和减轻军备负担”。
    草案中关于“单独和集体自卫权利”这一条实际上是给西方国家留下了在外国领土上维持自己的基地的可能性。
    在谈到防止侵略的共同行动方面，根据草案，只限于“各方为履行条约而进行磋商”。
    草案规定，条约条款将“按照一致同意的阶段逐步”生效。
    所谓“自由恢复德国统一的计划（艾登计划）”草案指出，德国的重新统一以及通过自由谈判的方式同统一的德国缔结和约的问题应当分下列阶段获得解决：一、全德自由选举；二、根据选举结果召开国民议会；三、草拟宪法（草案）和准备关于缔结和约的谈判；四、通过宪法和成立对谈判和缔结和约负责的全德政府；五、和约的签订和生效。
    草案规定不是由德国人自己，而是由法、苏、英、美四国在同德国专家咨商和考虑到联邦共和国的联邦议院和苏占区的人民议院已经为此而草拟的选举法的情况下草拟一项选举法。此外还规定，这一选举法“应得到四国的同意”。
    草案规定由外国对选举进行监督。各监督委员会应当由四国代表组成，有或者没有中立国代表的参加，有有发言权的德国公民的参加。
    草案中关于筹备选举的方法的部分指出，四国外长首先应当就目前计划所提到的原则达成协议。随后由四国驻德国的代表机构的人员组成的工作组拟订关于选举问题的细节。
    草案说，由国民议会成立的全德政府应该有自由决定是接受或者是拒绝联邦共和国和德国苏占区所承担的国际权利和义务。它还应当有自由随意缔结其他的这种国际协定。
    但是草案又说，国民议会、临时的全德当局和全德政府所采取的旨在履行艾登计划的决定，不需要取得四国的同意。这些决定只有四国的大多数票才能予以拒绝。
    草案最后指出，对德和约应当由所有曾经和德国处于战争状态的国家或者它们的继承者签订。和约应当在四国和德国批准时生效。
    莫洛托夫接着就欧洲安全问题发言。他提出了苏联代表团关于欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的基本原则的建议供会议考虑。莫洛托夫对麦克米伦代表西方三国提出的建议提出一些意见。
    杜勒斯接着发言。他表示同意麦克米伦的发言。之后，杜勒斯谈到莫洛托夫提出的某些意见，特别是莫洛托夫对于西方国家军事集团的评论。杜勒斯说，这些集团是“集体安全的组织”。
    杜勒斯承认四国政府在这些问题上有分歧，大概不可能在目前解决所有这些分歧。杜勒斯说，据他了解，莫洛托夫对西方三国建议表示的主要反对意见有两个：第一、建议要求德国加入北大西洋公约组织。第二、条约草案中规定的制裁所提供的仅仅是磋商。杜勒斯说，根据艾登计划，全德政府将有充分机会来接受或拒绝关于参加北大西洋公约组织或参加布鲁塞尔条约或华沙条约的建议。关于条约中所规定的制裁，它们——据杜勒斯说——比迄今所知道的任何其他国际协定深远得多。
    杜勒斯说，美国代表团当然会仔细地研究苏联代表团的建议。他说，至少三国的建议中的某些条款是同苏联代表团的建议一致的。但是在看法上却存在着一个基本的分歧。据杜勒斯说，这个分歧在于三国的建议是在处理密切关联的问题——重新统一德国的问题和欧洲安全的问题，而苏联的建议——杜勒斯硬说——同德国重新统一问题是没有联系的。他说，美国代表团在研究据他们所知苏联代表团将会提出的关于德国重新统一的建议之前很难研究苏联的建议。
    比内接着发言说，他认为三国的建议是一种合理的谈判基础，可能导致使得德国能够重新统一的协议。他说，法国政府相信，如果一个重新统一的德国参加“西方防御组织”，那就会保证对大家都安全。
    比内说，西方国家已经向苏联提出了一系列的更多的保证。他认为，西方国家的建议为开始进行谈判提供了机会，法国代表团将以适当的注意来研究苏联的建议。
    会议在比内发言之后散会。外长们将在二十九日下午再举行会议。
