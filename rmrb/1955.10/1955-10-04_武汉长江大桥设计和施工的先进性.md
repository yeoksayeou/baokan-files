    The Advanced Nature of the Design and Construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge
    by Mao Yisheng, Chairman of the Technical Advisory Committee of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge
    Chinese bridge architecture has a glorious history in the world history of bridge construction. The Zhaozhou Bridge in Hebei, completed more than 1,350 years ago and still in use today, is an outstanding example. This is a stone arch bridge with a clear span of 37 meters; on top of the main arch of this bridge, there are also four small arches, which not only reduced the weight of the bridge but also accelerated the flow of water. Such a scientific design did not appear in Europe until nine hundred years later. China is a country with many bridges, not only in terms of variety but also in terms of wide distribution. The local "Gazetteers" of various provinces all record the bridges built in the local area throughout the ages. They are large in number (for example, Suzhou Prefecture in Jiangsu Province, according to the Jiangnan Prefecture and County Records, has 397 bridges) and high in quality (such as many large bridges in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, Fujian, including the famous Luoyang Bridge). These all illustrate the remarkable technological skills and extraordinary creativity of the broad masses of Chinese working people. However, the development of bridge technology is determined by building materials and construction machinery. Under the long-term backwardness of science and industry in China, it was impossible for the bridge industry to develop independently. In modern times, under the influence of the "Eastern Spread of European Winds," the so-called modern bridges emerged. These modern bridges are made of new materials and new machinery. After the Chinese working people had new materials and new machinery, their wisdom and talent in bridge building have been further developed. Especially after the founding of the People's Republic of China, Chinese bridge technology entered a new stage, and the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is a representative of the rapid progress in technology.
    China's modern bridges came into being with the invasion of China by various imperialist countries. They first appeared in the so-called foreign "concessions" and foreign "invested" railways, and then spread to the railways and highways built by China itself. In chronological order, the larger railway bridges among these include the Luanhe Bridge on the Jing-Shan Railway, the Yellow River Bridge on the Jing-Han Railway, and the Huaihe River Bridge and the Yellow River Bridge on the Jin-Pu Railway. Highway bridges include the Ganjiang Bridge in Jiangxi, the Nenetan Bridge in Hunan, the Luohe Bridge in Henan, the Lancang River Bridge in Yunnan, the Dadu River Bridge in Sichuan, and the Wujiang River Bridge in Guizhou. Urban bridges include the Waibaidu Bridge in Shanghai, the Yellow River Bridge in Lanzhou, the International Bridge in Tianjin, the Zhongshan Bridge in Nanjing, and the Pearl River Bridge in Guangzhou. The railway-highway combined bridge is the Qiantang River Bridge in Hangzhou. These bridges were all completed before liberation. The construction of these bridges was related to various imperialist countries to varying degrees. Some were completely contracted by them, and some were contracted by them for all or part of the project according to the design. However, they all used foreign materials and foreign machinery, and none of them were successfully built entirely relying on China's own manpower, materials, and financial resources. Compared with China's old bridges, these bridges have made progress in science and technology. However, due to the monopoly or aggressive influence of foreign bridge "investment," the technical standards are very chaotic, which not only caused difficulties in maintenance and repair in the past, but also brought us many obstacles in the technical transformation problems today. Therefore, these original modern bridges, except for the individual designs or constructions that still have certain value, generally speaking, followed foreign achievements and did not make any significant contributions to bridge technology.
    The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is different from the many bridges mentioned above. It not only far exceeds any modern Chinese bridge in terms of construction scale and technical complexity, but also demonstrates its scientific and technological advancement in design, construction, and all technical facilities. Even the larger Jin-Pu Railway Yellow River Bridge and Hangzhou Qiantang River Bridge cannot be compared with the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.
    The advancement of a bridge is mainly reflected in the suitability, economy, and aesthetics of its structural form, as well as the quality, speed, cost-effectiveness, and safety of its construction methods. From the perspective of natural conditions such as topography, geology, and hydrology, building a bridge on the Yangtze River in Wuhan is much more difficult than building a bridge on the Yellow River or the Qiantang River. At the same time, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is huge in scale, with a double-track railway, six lanes of automobile roads, and four lanes of sidewalks passing over the bridge, and large ships over ten meters high passing under the bridge at high water levels; it is much larger in scale than the Yellow River Bridge and the Qiantang River Bridge. Therefore, we must adopt the latest achievements in science and technology in all technical facilities to maximize the effectiveness of manpower, materials, and financial resources.
    Of course, it is not enough to measure its superiority only from the size of the bridge or the difficulty of construction. It is also necessary to see how it solves these problems, how much it costs, and whether it is sufficient to serve as a model for future bridge construction. Only in this way can we give it a correct evaluation in science and technology and further promote the development of China's bridge industry. Let us look at the Yangtze River Bridge from this perspective.
    First of all, the survey and design of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge went through a long period of the most thorough preparation. Taking geological drilling as an example, it worked for more than three years from 1950, so that it could have a detailed understanding of the entire picture of the riverbed geology and select the most suitable bridge site line. This is something that no one building any bridge before has done. The Jin-Pu Railway Yellow River Bridge did a very poor job, and although the Qiantang River Bridge did more, the total length of the boreholes was only one-fifth of that of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Due to the mastery of a large amount of important data such as topography, geology, hydrology, and meteorology, the design and construction of the Yangtze River Bridge have a highly scientific theoretical basis.
    The greatest difficulty in bridge construction lies in building the foundation of underwater bridge piers, especially in places like Wuhan with wide river surfaces, strong winds and waves, deep and rapid currents, and much rain and heavy fog. Only by fully understanding all relevant natural conditions can we make the most reasonable technical design and improve the degree of mechanization of construction, and give full play to the effectiveness of labor. The Yangtze River in Wuhan is forty meters deep, the difference between the highest and lowest water levels is nineteen meters, the high water level period lasts for eight months each year, the sediment covering the riverbed varies in depth, and the geology of the rock formation under the sediment is quite complex. Under these many difficult conditions, the use of general construction methods would be ineffective, uneconomical, or too dangerous. The pier construction of the Yellow River Bridge and the Qiantang River Bridge both adopted the method of pneumatic caissons and driving piles under the caissons. (A pneumatic caisson is a device for excavating soil underwater, like a covered box without a bottom placed on the sediment at the bottom of the river, with bridge piers built on the caisson cover. The caisson cover has a cylinder extending out of the water surface, and compressed air is pumped in from this cylinder to drain the water in the caisson, allowing workers to go down to the caisson through the cylinder to excavate soil. The excavated soil is also transported out through the cylinder. The deeper the soil is dug, the slower the caisson sinks, and the higher the bridge piers on the caisson cover are built.) However, the caisson construction method has many shortcomings. First of all, it is very tiring and harmful to the health of the workers to work under high air pressure, and they often get sick. Moreover, the air pressure allowed for working in the caisson is also limited. If the water depth exceeds 37 meters, the workers will not be able to go down, and this method will be ineffective. Therefore, if the Yangtze River Bridge uses this method, it can only be constructed for three months each year, which is obviously not feasible. In addition, the caisson method requires a lot of machinery and equipment and a large number of skilled workers with specialized skills. There are not many such workers in China, which will delay the start date. These shortcomings are very obvious in the Yellow River Bridge and the Qiantang River Bridge, and are even more difficult to overcome in the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Therefore, the Yangtze River Bridge abandoned this old method and created a "pipe pile drilling method." This method is: to sink many hollow reinforced concrete "pipe piles" with a diameter about the size of a round table for twelve people to eat to the rock formation at the bottom of the river, and then use a large drilling machine to drill into the rock formation inside the pipe, creating a hole equal to the inner diameter of the pipe. Fill this hole and the hollow pipe pile above with concrete, so that each pipe pile becomes a concrete cylinder deeply embedded in the rock formation, and then use a circular "cofferdam" with a diameter ten times larger than the pipe pile to surround these many "pipe pile groups," and fill the gaps between the pipe piles with concrete at both the top and bottom of the cofferdam, so that these pipe piles are also connected to become a huge cylinder, which becomes a solid foundation for the lower part of the bridge pier. This method allows all underwater work to be operated by people on the water surface, is not limited by water depth, does not harm the health of workers, and can therefore be constructed year-round; the required machinery and equipment, except for large drilling machines, are relatively simple, so it can be started early. This solves the special difficulties of the Yangtze River Bridge construction and can shorten the construction period. Now, on the river surface between Wuchang and Hanyang, the foundation projects of three bridge piers are under intense construction, and all bridge piers can be completed ahead of schedule, and there will be great savings in terms of project cost. This is a good, fast, economical, and safe construction method. This method is not only suitable for large bridges like the one in Wuhan, but also can be applied to other bridges of all sizes if the size of the pipe piles and the treatment of the pile feet are appropriately changed. The key to this pipe pile drilling method lies in how to sink the pipe piles through the sediment, how to drill into the rock formation inside the pipe, and how to prevent the influx of sediment inside the pipe in order to pour concrete in the water. These can only be achieved by adopting the latest science and technology, and this has been successfully tested in the Yangtze River Bridge. This is the result of the Soviet experts' initiative and guidance, and the hard work of the masses day and night.
    The function of a bridge is embodied in the structure installed on the bridge piers. Its form, materials, and manufacture directly affect the bridge's ability to carry traffic and ships, and its safety. Generally, permanent bridge structures are made of structural steel or reinforced concrete. Due to different designs and manufacturing, the economic value of the bridge, including construction cost, maintenance, and expansion, varies greatly. The Yellow River Bridge on the Jin-Pu Railway adopted two different steel structures. In addition to nine-span simple beams, there are three-span cantilever beams. The middle span is as long as 164 meters, and the structure of the cantilever beams is particularly complex, which is really unnecessary. This not only wastes steel but also increases the difficulty of maintenance. The Qiantang River Bridge adopted a steel structure of sixteen-span simple beams with the same span, but the span of each span is too small, resulting in too many bridge piers, which not only prolongs the construction period but also increases the cost. In addition, the steel beam structures of the above two bridges all adopt members with complex cross-sections, which also increases the cost of manufacturing and maintenance. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge adopts long-span, equal-span steel beams. The length of each span is almost twice that of the Qiantang River Bridge, so there are fewer bridge piers, only half of those of the Qiantang River Bridge. This balances the cost of steel beams and bridge piers, thus achieving the most economical and beautiful purpose. In addition, the steel beams of the Yangtze River Bridge also adopt the method of three spans in one unit and three units in nine spans, so that the load on one span is shared by the other two spans; the structural form of each span is uniformly "lattice truss," and the members constituting the truss all use sections of the same shape; the railway is laid on the lower layer of the steel beam, the highway is laid on the upper layer, and the highway pavement is integrated with the truss "bridge deck system"; there are sidewalks on both sides of the railway and highway; the inclined rods at both ends of the steel beam are equipped with ladders to facilitate climbing up for inspection or repair. All of the above designs are unprecedented in Chinese bridges and are created under the principle of complying with suitability, economy, and aesthetics.
    The above-mentioned pier structure and steel beam design are the main conditions for evaluating any bridge. From these two themes, we can see the advancement of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, and the superiority of all other technical facilities is self-evident.

    武汉长江大桥设计和施工的先进性
    武汉长江大桥技术顾问委员会主任委员　茅以昇
    中国的桥梁建筑在全世界桥梁建筑史上有过极其光荣的历史。在一千三百五十多年以前完成而一直使用到现在的河北赵州桥，就是一个最杰出的例子。这是个净孔长达三十七公尺的石拱桥；在这个桥的大拱上面，还立着四个小拱，不但减轻了桥重，而且还加速过水。像这样科学化的设计，在欧洲是迟至九百年以后才有的。我国是个多桥的国家，不但形式多而且分布很广。在各省的地方“志书”中，都记载有当地历代建筑的桥梁。它们数量大（如江苏苏州一府，据江南府县志载，就有三百九十七座桥梁），质量也高（如福建泉州漳州两地的许多大桥，包括著名的洛阳桥）。这些都说明我国广大的劳动人民，在他们工艺上技术的卓越和非凡的创造性。但是桥梁技术的发展是决定于建筑材料和施工机具的。在我国科学和工业的长期落后的情况下，桥梁事业也就不可能单独地发展。到了近代，受了“欧风东渐”的影响，才有了所谓近代桥梁的产生。这些近代桥梁，就是用新式材料和新式机具所造成的。我国劳动人民在有了新式材料和新式机具以后，造桥的智慧和才能有了进一步的发展，特别是在中华人民共和国成立以后，中国的桥梁技术就进入一个新阶段，武汉长江大桥的建设，就是技术上飞快进步的代表。
    中国的近代桥梁是随着各国帝国主义对中国的侵略而俱来的，它首先出现在所谓外国的“租界”和外国“投资”的铁路上，其后才在我国自己修造的铁路、公路上推广起来。按时间的先后，这些桥梁中比较大的铁路桥有京山线的滦河桥、京汉线的黄河桥、津浦线的淮河桥和黄河桥等。公路桥有江西的赣江桥，湖南的能滩桥，河南的洛河桥，云南的澜沧江桥，四川的大渡河桥，贵州的乌江桥等。城市中的桥梁有上海的外白渡桥，兰州的黄河桥，天津的万国桥，南京的中山桥，广州的珠江桥等。铁路公路城市联合桥有杭州的钱塘江桥。这些桥梁都是在解放以前完成的，这些桥的修建都同各国帝国主义有不同程度的关系，有的是完全由它们一手包办的，有的是根据设计由它们承包全部或一部分工程的，但它们都是用了外国材料、外国机具，没有一个是完全依靠中国自己的人力、物力、财力而修建成功的。这些桥同我国旧有的桥相比，在科学技术上有了进步；但是由于外国桥梁“投资”的垄断或侵略影响，其技术标准非常混乱，不但在过去造成了养护维修的困难，而且直到今天还在技术改造的问题上给我们带来了重重障碍。因此，这些原有的近代桥梁，除去个别设计或施工还有它一定价值外，总的说来，都是沿袭外国成果，并没有对桥梁技术作出如何重大的贡献。
    武汉长江大桥和上述的许多座桥不同，它不但在建筑规模和技术复杂上远远超过了任何一个中国近代的桥梁，而且在设计施工和一切技术设施上都表现出它在科学技术上的先进性。即使规模较大的津浦铁路黄河桥和杭州钱塘江桥，也都无法同武汉长江大桥相比。
    一个桥梁的先进性，主要表现在它的结构形式的适用、经济和美观以及它施工方法的好、快、省和安全。从地形地质水文等自然条件来看，在武汉长江上修桥是比在黄河或钱塘江上修桥困难得多。同时武汉长江大桥的规模巨大，桥上要通过双线铁路、六排汽车道和四排人行道，桥下还要在高水位时通过十几公尺高的大轮船；比黄河桥和钱塘江桥的规模要大得多。因此，要在一切技术设施中采用科学技术上的最新的成就，来发挥人力、物力和财力的最大效果。
    当然，仅仅从桥的规模大小或施工难易的情况还不足衡量它的优越性，还要看它对这些问题是怎样解决的，用了多少代价，是否足以作为将来修桥的榜样，这才能在科学技术上给它一个正确评价，进一步促进我国桥梁事业的发展。让我们从这一个角度上来看长江大桥吧。
    首先，武汉长江大桥的勘测设计是经过了长时期的最充分的准备工作的。拿地质钻探来说，自一九五○年起，工作了三年多，因而能对江底地质的全貌有周详的了解，选出最合适的桥址线。这是以前建筑任何桥梁的人所没有做到的。津浦铁路黄河桥就做得非常不够，钱塘江桥虽然做得多些，但钻孔总长度只及武汉长江大桥的五分之一。由于掌握了大量的地形地质水文气象等重要资料，长江大桥的设计和施工就有了高度科学性的理论根据。
    修桥的最大困难在于建筑水下的桥墩基础，特别是在像武汉这样江面宽、风浪大，水深流急、雨多雾重的地方。必须充分了解一切有关的自然条件，才能针对这些条件，作出最合理的技术设计并提高施工机械化的程度，充分发挥劳动力的效果。武汉长江水深四十公尺，最高最低水位相差十九公尺，高水位时期每年持续八个月之久，江底泥沙覆盖层深浅不一，泥沙下面的岩盘地质又相当复杂，在这许多困难条件下来造桥，用一般的施工方法就会失去效用或太不经济或过于危险。黄河桥和钱塘江桥的桥墩建筑都采用了压气沉箱并在箱下打桩的办法。（压气沉箱是在水下挖土的一种设备，像一个有盖无底的箱子覆在江底泥沙上，箱盖上建筑桥墩。沉箱盖上有个圆筒伸出水面，从这圆筒内打入压缩空气就把沉箱里的水排出，让工人们经过圆筒下到沉箱内挖土，挖出的土也经圆筒运出，土越挖越深，箱子就慢慢下沉，箱盖上的桥墩也越筑越高。）但沉箱施工法有很多缺点。首先，工人们在高气压下工作是非常劳累和有损健康的，往往会得病。而且箱内容许工作的空气压力也是有限度的，如果水深超过三十七公尺，工人们就无法下去，这个方法就失效了。因此，长江大桥如用这个方法，每年就只能施工三个多月，显然是行不通的。再加沉箱法需要很多机具设备和大批专门技术的熟练工人，这样的工人在我国是不多的，这就会推迟开工日期。这些缺点在黄河桥和钱塘江桥都是很明显的，在武汉长江大桥就更难克服。因此，长江大桥就放弃了这个旧方法而创造出一种“管柱钻孔法”。这方法是：把很多直径同十二人吃饭用的圆桌面差不多大的空心圆形钢筋混凝土“管柱”沉到江底岩盘上，再在管内用大型钻机钻进岩盘，打出一个同管柱内径相等的孔，把这个孔连同上面空心的管柱全部用混凝土填满，使每个管柱成为一根深深嵌入岩盘的混凝土圆柱，然后再用一个直径比管柱大十倍的圆形“围堰”，把这许多“管柱群”围起来，并在围堰上下两头用混凝土把各管柱间的空隙填满，使这些管柱又联系成为一个庞大的圆柱，这就成为桥墩下部牢固的基础了。这种方法，使所有水下工作都由人在水面上操纵，不受水深的限制，不损害工人的健康，因而可以常年施工；所需机械设备，除去大型钻孔机外，都比较简单，因而可以提前开工。这就解决了长江大桥施工的特殊困难，还可缩短工期。现在，武昌汉阳间的江面上，已经有三个桥墩的基础工程，正在紧张施工，全部桥墩都可提前完工，在工程造价方面也有很大的节省。这是一个好、快、省和安全的施工方法。这个方法不但适用于像在武汉这样的大桥，如适当地改变管柱大小和对柱脚的处理，还可应用于其他大小桥梁。这个管柱钻孔法的关键在于如何穿过泥沙下沉管柱，如何在管内向岩盘上钻孔，以及如何在管内防止泥沙的涌入，以便在水中灌注混凝土。这些只有采用最新的科学技术才能做到，而这在长江大桥是已经试验成功。这是在苏联专家的创议和指导下，通过群众智慧，日夜辛勤劳动的结果。
    一个桥梁的功用体现于安装在桥墩上面的结构上，它的形式、材料和制作都直接影响到桥梁的通车过船的能力和安全。一般永久性的桥梁结构都是用型钢或钢筋混凝土造成的。由于设计和制造不同，桥梁的经济价值，包括造价、维修和扩建等大有差别。津浦线黄河桥采用了两种不同的钢结构，除了九孔简支梁外，有三孔伸臂梁，中孔长达一百六十四公尺，伸臂梁的构造又特别复杂，实在没有必要，这样不但浪费了钢料而且增加了维修的困难。钱塘江桥采用了同跨度的十六孔简支梁的钢结构，但每孔跨度又嫌过小，因而桥墩过多，不但延长了工期，而且加大了成本。此外，上述两桥的钢梁结构都采用了截面复杂的杆件，也增加了制造和维修的费用。武汉长江大桥是采用了长跨度、等跨度的钢梁，每孔长度几乎等于钱塘江桥的两倍，因而桥墩较少，只及钱塘江桥的一半，这样便使钢梁和桥墩的造价平衡因而达到最经济最美观的目的。此外，长江大桥的钢梁还采用了三孔一联、三联九孔的办法，使一孔上的载重由其他两孔分担；每孔结构形式都一律用了“菱格桁架”，构成桁架的杆件都一律用同形状的截面；钢梁下层铺铁路，上层铺公路，公路路面同桁架“桥面系”结合成整体；铁路公路两旁都有人行道；钢梁两端斜杆上都设有扶梯，以便于登高检查或修理。所有以上这些设计，都是中国桥梁前所未有的，都是在服从适用、经济和美观的原则下创造出来的。
    以上所说的桥墩构造和钢梁设计是对任何一个桥梁的评价的主要条件。在这两个主题上就看得到武汉长江大桥的先进性，在其他一切技术设施方面的优越性也就不言而喻了。
