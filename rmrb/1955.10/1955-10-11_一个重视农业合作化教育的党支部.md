    A Party Branch That Emphasizes Agricultural Cooperativization Education
    Su Shilu
    Chienmin Village in Chiaoho County, Hopeh Province, has a total of 294 households and has established five agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 50% of the farm households joining the cooperatives. After the central government's instructions on agricultural cooperativization and the spirit of the Fourth Hopeh Provincial Party Congress were conveyed to Chienmin Village, the village's Party branch convened a branch committee to analyze and assess the ideological situation of all Party members. The village has a total of twenty-two Party members, eighteen of whom have joined the cooperatives. Their ideological situation is as follows: Fifteen are actively running the cooperatives and resolutely taking the socialist road; three are emotionally negative; the four Party members who have not joined the cooperatives are unwilling to participate in labor or join the cooperatives. Based on this situation, the branch convened a Party member meeting. In addition to carrying out socialist future education, it commended the deeds of Party member Chen Fuqing for his enthusiasm in running the cooperatives, and criticized Party member Li Qingxiang's erroneous thinking of not caring about running the cooperatives. On the basis of further improving the awareness of Party members, criticism and self-criticism were launched. Party member Li Qingxiang confessed, "I have not completely followed the path pointed out by the Party. When the cooperative was being established in the spring, I and my father pretended to separate the family and were unwilling to join the cooperative. This is an undesirable behavior for a Party member. I will resolutely correct this mistake and resolutely join the cooperative after the autumn harvest."
    After unifying thoughts within the Party, the Party branch, according to the principle of "overall planning, strengthening leadership" in running the cooperatives, first started with class analysis and formulated a cooperativization plan for the whole village. Of the 144 households in the village that had not joined the cooperatives, 28 were upper-middle peasants among the old middle peasants, 33 were lower-middle peasants among the old middle peasants, eight were upper-middle peasants among the new middle peasants, 35 were lower-middle peasants among the new middle peasants, 30 were poor peasants, and 10 were landlords, rich peasants, and leaders of the I-Kuan-Tao sect. The thinking of these people was: Poor peasants actively demanded to join the cooperatives, such as the wife of poor peasant Gao Wang, who went to the cooperative several times to request joining. The lower-middle peasants among the new middle peasants and the lower-middle peasants among the old middle peasants generally actively demanded to join the cooperatives, while individual households hesitated and waited. As long as the policies are explained clearly, they will actively demand to join the cooperatives. Some of the upper-middle peasants among the old middle peasants and the upper-middle peasants among the new middle peasants were still unwilling to join the cooperatives. Zheng Detai, an upper-middle peasant among the old middle peasants, asked the village cadres: If I don't join the cooperative, will the higher authorities still sell me salt? Landlords and rich peasants pretended to be honest and wanted to join the cooperative for speculation. Rich peasant element Li Yanxu, who was dissatisfied with the cooperative in the past, is now asking people to vouch for him to join the cooperative. Based on this situation, the Party branch decided to first absorb poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants into the cooperative. This winter and next spring, they plan to absorb 106 households into the cooperative, so that the number of farm households joining the cooperative will reach 87% of the total number of farm households. Education should be strengthened for the upper-middle peasants among the old middle peasants and the hesitant upper-middle peasants among the new middle peasants. Landlords, rich peasants, and bad elements must not be allowed to join the cooperative.
    After the plan was made, all Party members launched propaganda. First, the facts of increased production in the cooperatives were used to educate the masses. According to calculations, the average yield per mu for the five cooperatives in the village was 301 catties of grain. At the same time, ten mutual aid group members and individual farmers were identified, including three households with better cultivation, four households with average cultivation, and three households with poorer cultivation, for crop comparison. The average yield per mu for these ten households was 160 catties of grain, 141 catties less per mu than the land in the cooperatives. The Party branch used this fact to conduct propaganda through mass meetings, group meetings, and at any time and place, pointing out the superiority of the cooperatives. As a result, the thinking of the original twenty-five unstable cooperative members was strengthened, and they actively participated in production. Farmers outside the cooperatives also actively demanded to join the cooperatives.
    When carrying out education comparing the yields of cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and individual farmers, the branch also used specimens of sixteen kinds of crops, such as cotton, corn, and yam, with strengthened technical management and without strengthened technical management, belonging to the cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and individual farmers. These specimens were displayed in the big temple to mobilize the masses to visit the exhibition. Through this fact, it was explained that only by organizing can labor be used reasonably and agricultural technology be improved more quickly to achieve increased production. This point was also very educational for the farmers, who said one after another, "Organizing is like an agricultural school, while working alone is worthless."
    At the same time, the Party branch paid attention to using activists to conduct propaganda through networking. For example, mobilizing cooperative member Xia Zhanjiang to use the fact that he increased production by more than 2,000 catties of grain after joining the cooperative dispelled Guo Tonghan's concerns about suffering losses by joining the cooperative, and Guo Tonghan actively signed up to join the cooperative. In this period of work, more than thirty activists were also cultivated.
    It is precisely because the Party branch actively carried out these propaganda, education, and backbone cultivation work that the cooperativization movement in the whole village has been pushed to a climax. Now, farmers are asking to join the cooperatives one after another, and sixty-one households have already signed up, and are expanding the cooperatives and establishing new cooperatives.
    In order to point out the goal of struggle for the farmers of the whole village, the Party branch also convened a forum of old farmers to summarize the experience of increasing production, and pointed out the production increase goals for next year: First, to expand the cultivated area. After the cooperative establishment plan is completed, 62 threshing grounds can be saved within the cooperative, reducing 2,100 field boundaries, which can expand the cultivated area by 136 mu. In addition, 54 pieces of idle residential land, 31 pieces of graveyard land, 14 ditches, and 14 water pits can be found, expanding the cultivated area by more than 400 mu. These lands can be planted with vegetables, reeds, tobacco, alfalfa, etc., to harvest several thousand catties of grain. Second, to expand the cultivated area of high-yield crops. The two large cooperatives in the village, with a total of more than 3,400 mu of land, plan to plant 1,500 mu of wheat next year, with a yield of 150 catties per mu; 500 mu of corn, with a yield of 400 catties per mu, and plant potatoes on more than 600 mu of river beach land that has been flooded over the years. Mobilize farmers outside the cooperative to also expand the cultivated area of high-yield crops. Third, expand water sources to prevent drought. The whole village plans to dig thirty brick wells and one powered well next year, add thirty waterwheels, and, together with the existing thirty wells, can turn 1,500 mu of dry land into paddy fields; and build two drainage ditches to prevent waterlogging. In this way, not only can the cultivated area be expanded, but also the goal of an average yield of 400 catties of grain per mu can be achieved.

    一个重视农业合作化教育的党支部
    苏世禄
    河北省交河县千民屯村共二百九十四户，已经建立起五个农业生产合作社，入社农户占总农户的百分之五十多。自从中央关于农业合作化的指示和河北省第四次党代表会议的精神传达到千民屯村后，这个村的党支部就召开了支部委员会，对所有党员的思想进行了分析排队。全村共有二十二个党员，其中有十八人入了社，他们的思想情况是：有十五人积极办社，坚决走社会主义道路；有三人情绪消极；没入社的四个党员，因不愿参加劳动，也不愿入社。根据这一情况，支部就召开了党员大会，除进行了社会主义前途教育外，并表扬了党员陈福庆热心办社的事迹；同时批判了党员李庆祥不关心办社的错误思想。并在进一步提高党员觉悟的基础上，展开了批评和自我批评。党员李庆祥检讨说：“我没有完全按照党指出的道路走，在春天办社时，我和我爸爸闹假分家，不愿入社，这是一个党员不应有的行为，我坚决改正这个错误，秋后坚决入社。”
    在党内统一了思想以后，党支部根据“全面规划，加强领导”的办社方针，首先从阶级分析入手，制定了全村合作化规划。全村没入社的共一百四十四户，其中老中农中的上中农二十八户，老中农中的下中农三十三户，新中农中的上中农八户，新中农中的下中农三十五户，贫农三十户，地主、富农和一贯道首十户。这些人的思想是：贫农积极要求入社，如贫农高旺的媳妇，曾几次找到社里要求入社。新中农中的下中农和老中农中的下中农，一般的是积极要求入社，个别的犹豫观望，只要把政策交代清楚，他们就会积极要求入社。老中农中的上中农和新中农中的上中农，还有些不愿入社。老中农中的上中农郑德太问村干部：不入社上级还卖给盐不？地主、富农假装老实，想投机入社。富农分子李延绪，过去对社不满，现在托人打保入社。根据这个情况，党支部决定先吸收贫农、新老中农中的下中农入社，今冬明春计划吸收一百零六户入社，入社农户达到总农户的百分之八十七。对老中农中的上中农和新中农中犹豫的上中农，要加强教育。对地主、富农和坏分子坚决不让入社。
    计划做好后，全体党员就展开了宣传。首先是用合作社的增产事实教育群众。全村五个社，计算的结果平均每亩产粮三百零一斤。同时又找出了十户互助组员和个体农民，其中种地较好的有三户，一般的四户，较差的三户，进行庄稼对比。这十户的地平均每亩产粮一百六十斤，比社里的地每亩差一百四十一斤。党支部就用这一事实，通过群众大会、片会和随时随地进行宣传，指出社的优越性。这样，原来不坚定的二十五户社员思想坚定了，并积极参加了生产。社外农民也积极要求入社。
    在进行社和社外农民产量对比教育时，支部还用了社、互助组和个体农民加强技术管理和没有加强技术管理的棉花、玉米、山药等十六种作物标本陈列在大庙里，发动群众参观展览。通过这一事实，说明只有组织起来才能合理使用劳力，更快地提高农业技术，达到增产。这一点对农民教育也很大，农民纷纷说：“组织起来活像一个农业学校，单干算不沾。”
    同时党支部注意利用积极分子进行串连的办法进行宣传。如发动社员夏占江，用自己入社增产二千多斤粮食的事实，解除了郭同汉入社怕吃亏的顾虑，郭同汉积极报名入社。在这一段工作中还培养出三十多个积极分子。
    正是由于党支部积极进行了这些宣传教育和培养骨干的工作，把全村合作化运动推向高潮，现在农民纷纷要求入社，已有六十一户农民报了名，正在扩大社和建立新社。
    为了给全村农民指出奋斗的目标，党支部还召开了老农座谈会，总结增产经验，指出了明年的增产目标：首先是扩大耕地面积。在完成建社计划后，社内可节省出六十二片场，减少二千一百条地界，可扩大耕地一百三十六亩。此外还可找出闲宅基五十四片、坟场三十一片、道沟十四条、水坑十四个，共可扩大耕地四百多亩。这些地种植蔬菜，栽苇，种烟、苜蓿等，可收获几千斤粮食。第二是扩大高产作物耕地面积，全村两个大社，共三千四百多亩地，明年计划种麦一千五百亩，每亩产一百五十斤；种玉米五百亩，每亩产四百斤，并把历年被水淹的六百多亩河滩地种土豆。发动社外农民也扩大高产作物耕地面积。第三、扩大水源，防止天旱。全村计划明年打三十眼砖井，一眼机井，增添三十辆水车，连现有三十眼井，可把一千五百亩旱田变成水田；并兴修两条顺水沟，防止沥涝。这样，不光扩大耕地面积，并可达到平均每亩产四百斤粮食的目标。
