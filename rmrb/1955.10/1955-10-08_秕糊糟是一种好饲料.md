    Malted Grain Silage is a Good Feed
    Jia Ping
    Malted Grain Silage is made by fermenting agricultural byproducts such as chaff, sorghum shells, and soybean hairs in a cellar. The quality of this feed is similar to distiller's grains. Pigs love to eat it, and it helps them gain weight and produce meat.
    Chen Baochang, a farmer in Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, and Zhang Yu'en, a farmer in Gaiping County, used this feed to solve the problem of pig feed shortages. Zhang Yu'en's mutual aid team (seven farmers) raised eight sows and nine boars last year. This year, Liaoning Province listed the use of Malted Grain Silage as one of four methods in promoting the experience of using coarse feed to feed pigs.
    The method of fermenting Malted Grain Silage in a cellar is relatively simple. Before putting it into the cellar, first sift the chaff, sorghum shells, soybean hairs, etc., mix them together with an appropriate amount of water, and then put them into the cellar and tamp them down firmly. The fermentation time for chaff etc. generally takes four to five months. The fermented chaff etc. is Malted Grain Silage that can be used to feed pigs.
    Many areas in the North are currently harvesting crops. A lot of chaff, sorghum, and soybean hairs will be produced during the autumn harvest and threshing. Areas lacking pig feed can collect these materials and try to make Malted Grain Silage.

    秕糊糟是一种好饲料
    贾屏
    秕糊糟是用农作物的副产物秕谷、高粱壳、豆毛等窖制而成的。这种饲料的质量和酒糟相似，猪很爱吃，吃了也能上膘长肉。
    辽宁省辽阳县的农民陈宝昌和盖平县的农民张玉恩就是利用这种饲料解决猪食缺乏的问题的，张玉恩所领导的互助组（七户农民），去年全组养母猪八口、克郎猪九口。辽宁省今年在推广利用粗饲料喂猪的经验中，就把利用秕糊糟列为四种方法的一种。
    秕糊糟的窖制方法比较简单。入窖以前先把秕谷、高粱壳、豆毛等筛净并搀混一起加入适量的水分，然后入窖踏实。秕谷等发酵的时间一般需四、五个月。发酵后的秕谷等就是可以喂猪的秕糊糟。
    目前北方许多地区正在秋收，在秋收打场中会产生许多秕谷、高粱、豆毛等。缺乏猪饲料的地区，可以搜集这些东西试制秕糊糟。
