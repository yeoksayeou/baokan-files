Hubei Province's grain departments have improved their grain storage work. In the past six months, the province has seen 332 insect-free granaries, 714 mold-free granaries, and 1,534 safe and hygienic granaries. The capacity of these three types of granaries accounts for one-third of the province's total granary capacity. In the past six months, these granaries have saved the state more than 479,500 jin of grain. The amount of mold-damaged grain in the Huanggang County granary in the first half of this year decreased by 55.5% compared with the same period last year, and the amount of grain damaged by insects also decreased by 66% compared with the same period last year. The storage loss of the Qichun County Gaoxinpu Grain Store in the first half of this year decreased by 95.5% compared with the same period last year.

The great achievements in grain storage work are due to the fact that storage personnel have strengthened their concept of saving grain and actively sought ways to improve their work. Storage workers in Hanchuan, Yingshan, Xiaogan and other counties' granaries have created hundreds of rat-catching tools, greatly improving rat-catching efficiency. In the past, the leaders and masses of the Wuhan No. 3 Rice Mill did not pay attention to shaking out the loose grain in the burlap sacks. Now, after the storage worker Liu Jinhua shook out more than 3,000 jin of grain from a batch of burlap sacks, they have attached importance to the work of shaking out the burlap sacks and made this work a regular system. When grain enters and leaves the warehouse in Shashi Granary, they ensure that the bag openings are tightly sewn, unloaded gently, and loose grain is cleaned up in a timely manner, saving the state more than 30,000 jin of grain in six months.

    湖北粮食保管工作大有改善
    湖北省粮食部门改进粮食保管工作以来，半年中，全省出现了无虫粮仓三百三十二个，无霉粮仓七百一十四个，安全卫生粮仓一千五百三十四个。这三种粮仓容量占全省粮仓总容量的三分之一。这些粮仓，半年来为国家节约了粮食四十七万九千五百余斤。黄冈县粮仓今年上半年霉坏粮食的数量，比去年同期降低百分之五十五点五，虫害粮数也比去年同期降低百分之六十六；蕲春县高新铺粮店今年上半年的保管损耗数更比去年同期降低百分之九十五点五。
    粮食保管工作所以获得很大成绩，是因为保管人员加强了节约粮食的观念，积极想办法改进工作。汉川、应山、孝感等县粮仓的保管员创造了数百件捕鼠的工具，大大提高了捕鼠效率。武汉市第三米厂的领导人员和群众，过去都不注意清抖麻袋里的散粮，现在经过保管员刘锦华在一批麻袋中抖出三千多斤粮食的事实教育，他们重视了清抖麻袋工作，并使这一工作成为经常制度。沙市粮仓在粮食进出库时，作到了缝紧包口，轻卸轻放和及时打扫散粮，半年内为国家节约粮食三万多斤。
