Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 30th. The Central Standing Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front held an enlarged meeting in Hanoi on the 29th.

    The meeting heard a report from the Vietnam Fatherland Front's Unified Movement Committee on the struggle for the unification of the country, and a report from the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front on the dissemination of the Vietnam Fatherland Front's program. Important resolutions were made on the South Vietnamese "referendum" and the implementation of the Vietnam Fatherland Front program.

    The resolution pointed out that the Ngo Dinh Diem regime's actions of holding a "referendum," and proceeding to adopt a "constitution" and establish a separate South Vietnamese "National Assembly" are serious violations of the Geneva Accords. This is a conspiracy of American imperialism.

    The resolution also stated that the program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front has been warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in both North and South Vietnam, as well as by overseas Chinese, and has received attention from world public opinion.

    The resolution decided:

    (1) The Vietnam Fatherland Front will continue to support the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in correctly implementing the Geneva Accords, continue to advance the struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs, oppose their conspiracies to formulate a "constitution" in South Vietnam, establish a separate "National Assembly," and drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. It demands that the Southern authorities and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam conduct consultations, correctly discuss the issue of free general elections to unify the country in accordance with the Geneva Accords, and demands that the French government, which signed the Geneva Accords, thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords.

    (2) The various parties, organizations, and individuals within the Vietnam Fatherland Front will continue to widely and deeply promote the program of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, strive to realize this program, in order to establish a strong national united front, and work hard to consolidate North Vietnam.

    (3) The Vietnam Fatherland Front particularly welcomes the heroic spirit of the people of South Vietnam in their struggle for peace, unification, independence, and democracy, and welcomes the support of overseas Chinese for the struggle within the country for the sacred rights of the nation.

    (4) The Vietnam Fatherland Front warmly supports the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference currently being held in Geneva, aimed at further easing international tensions. The Vietnam Fatherland Front expresses the hope that the Geneva Conference will take note of the issues of the Far East, including the Vietnam issue, in order to seek appropriate solutions, so that the situation in the Far East and the world situation can be eased.
