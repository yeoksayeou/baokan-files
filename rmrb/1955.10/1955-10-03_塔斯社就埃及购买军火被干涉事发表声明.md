Xinhua News Agency, October 2nd: TASS, Moscow, October 1st: TASS issued the following statement: It is evident from foreign press reports that recently, some countries have intensified pressure on certain Middle Eastern countries (Egypt), forcing them to purchase weapons necessary for their national defense from Western countries and under conditions stipulated by Western countries.

It can also be seen from the subsequent statement issued by the Egyptian government on this matter that the Egyptian government believes that this pressure exerted on Egypt is an intolerable interference that undermines Egypt's national independence and its legitimate national defense interests.

The Soviet government believes that every country has the legitimate right to be concerned about its national defense and to purchase weapons necessary for its national defense from other countries under normal commercial terms. No foreign country has the right to interfere or to make any unilateral demands that infringe upon the rights or interests of other countries.

Having learned that Egypt and Czechoslovakia recently conducted negotiations on the sale of weapons in exchange for cotton and rice, some people have made unwarranted complaints to the Soviet Union regarding this matter. The Soviet government has notified the governments of Egypt and Czechoslovakia of its aforementioned position, as well as the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, which have issued special statements on this issue.

    塔斯社就埃及购买军火被干涉事发表声明
    新华社二日讯　塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：塔斯社发表声明如下：从外国报纸的消息中可以看出，最近有些国家向中东某些国家（埃及）加紧施加压力，使它们一定要向西方国家并且按照西方国家所规定的条件来购买它们的国防所需要的武器。
    从埃及政府随后就这件事情发表的声明中还可以看出，埃及政府认为这种对埃及施加的压力是损害埃及的民族独立和它的合法的国防利益的一种不能容忍的干涉。
    苏联政府方面认为：每一个国家有关心自己国防和按照通常的商业条件向其他国家购买自己的国防所需要的武器的合法权利，任何一个外国都没有权利加以干涉，也没有权利提出侵犯其他国家的权利或利益的任何片面要求。
    由于获悉最近埃及和捷克斯洛伐克两国进行了关于出售武器以交换棉花和大米的问题的谈判，对这件事情，有人向苏联提出了毫无理由的抱怨，苏联政府已经把自己的上述立场通知了埃及和捷克斯洛伐克的政府，也通知了曾经就这个问题发表特别声明的英国和美国的政府。
