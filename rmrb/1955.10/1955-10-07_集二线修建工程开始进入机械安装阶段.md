    The earthwork, stonework, bridges, culverts, track ballast laying, and civil construction of buildings along the Jining-Erlian railway line were largely completed by the end of September. The construction of the Jining-Erlian railway line has begun to enter the mechanical installation phase.
    Before National Day, the main structure of a number of factory buildings along the Jining-Erlian railway line were completed. Workers from the mechanical installation teams immediately entered the workshops and began installing various machines. The Jining Machinery Repair Plant of the Third Engineering Bureau, the Jining Locomotive Depot, and other units have formed nearly ten specialized mechanical installation teams for circuit wiring, replacement, machinery, and water supply, and have started work on the construction sites along the Jining to Erlian line.
    Signal installation work has been launched throughout the entire line. Tall and conspicuous signal machines have been erected at all stations along the line. The installation of route lock boxes and signal handles that connect the signal machines and turnouts has been completed. At some of the larger stations, formal communication switchboards and power distribution equipment are being installed. In order to prepare for joint operations, workers responsible for maintaining communication lines are both ensuring smooth communication and actively participating in the work of the mechanical installation teams.
    Water supply workers have completed eight well-drilling projects, finding the necessary water source for the Jining-Erlian railway line to open to traffic and conduct joint operations. Currently, each water supply station has laid more than 31,000 meters of water pipes and built six water towers and a mountain reservoir. The installation of pumping machinery has begun at some stations.

    集二线修建工程开始进入机械安装阶段
    集二线全线的土、石方和桥梁、涵管、线路铺碴及房屋工程的土木建筑部分，到九月底已经大部完成。集二线修建工程开始进入机械安装阶段。
    集二线沿线工地在国庆节前夕有一批厂房的主体工程完工，机械安装队的工人随即进入车间，开始安装各种机械。第三工程局集宁机械修配厂、集宁机务段等单位已组成电路配线、换装、机务、给水等近十个专业机械安装队，在集宁到二连的沿线工地开始工作。
    信号安装工程已在全线展开。沿线所有车站都矗立起高大醒目的信号机。联结信号机和道岔的进路锁盒、信号握柄的安装工作已经完成。在一些比较大的车站上，正在装置正式通讯用的交换总机、配电设备等。为了迎接联运，负责维修通讯线路的工人，一面保证电讯畅通，一面积极参加了机械安装队的工作。
    给水工人们已经完成了八处凿井工程，为集二线通车联运找到了必需的水源。现在，各给水站已铺设好三万一千多公尺的水管，筑起了六个水塔和一个山上水库。抽水机械安装工作，已在部分车站上开始进行。（新华社）
