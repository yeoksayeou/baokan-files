    Self-Made Seismograph Shows Good Performance in Testing
    China's first self-made seismograph has been used in the Yumen Oilfield and is performing well.
    This domestically produced seismograph was manufactured by the Xi'an Geophysical Laboratory of the former Petroleum Management Bureau's Geological Bureau. It consists of two parts: an instrument vehicle and detectors. Most of the components used in this instrument, except for a small number of parts such as vacuum tubes, are made in China.
    In mid-August, staff from the Xi'an Geophysical Laboratory brought this seismograph to the 202 Seismological Team of the Yumen Mining Bureau's Geological Survey Department for testing and comparison with Soviet seismographs. This domestically produced seismograph can be used for both reflection and refraction. During the 202 team's refraction testing, twenty days of testing proved that the seismograph met requirements, especially the detectors, which were very sensitive. Currently, staff from the Xi'an Geophysical Laboratory have gone to northern Shaanxi to conduct reflection testing.
    The cost of the domestically produced seismograph is also very low. The Xi'an Geophysical Laboratory plans to begin mass production of seismographs next year to meet the needs of the increasingly developing petroleum exploration work.

    自制地震仪试验效能良好
    我国自制的第一部地震仪，在玉门油矿试用，效能良好。
    这部国产的地震仪是前石油管理总局地质局西安地球物理实验室制造的。它包括仪器车和检波器两部分。这个仪器上用的机件，除了真空管等一小部分零件外，绝大部分都是我国自己制造的。
    八月中旬，西安地球物理实验室工作人员带着这部地震仪到玉门矿务局地质调查处二零二地震队，同苏联地震仪对比着进行了试验。这部国产地震仪可以兼作反射和折射。在二零二队试验折射部分时，二十天的试验证明，这部地震仪合乎要求，特别是检波器，灵敏度很高。现在，西安地球物理实验室的工作人员已经去陕北作反射部分的试验。
    国产地震仪的成本也很低。西安地球物理实验室准备在明年开始大量制造地震仪，以适应日益发展的石油探勘工作的需要。
