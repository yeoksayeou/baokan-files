    "Beijing Shooting Range" Completed
    The "Beijing Shooting Range," which is preparing to host the "1955 International Friendship Shooting Competition" in Beijing in November, was completed on October 8. This shooting range is located at the foot of the Western Hills in the suburbs of Beijing, covering an area of 17.7 hectares. It has three shooting ranges for rifles, small-bore sporting rifles, and pistol silhouette targets, with a capacity of 2,200 spectators.
    The shooting range is equipped with modern and electrical facilities, meeting the requirements of international competitions. Each shooter has a signal controller next to them. Each range judge has a telephone to contact the judges and staff in the target pit at any time. The rifle shooting range and the small-bore sporting rifle shooting range each have 70 target positions. The silhouette targets in the pistol silhouette target shooting range are all electrically operated. During the competition, each shooter must continuously shoot five silhouette targets in four seconds. As soon as four seconds pass, the silhouette targets automatically turn to the side, preventing the shooter from hitting them again.

    “北京射击场”建成
    准备迎接十一月份在北京举行的“一九五五年国际友谊射击竞赛”的“北京射击场”，已在十月八日建成。这座射击场在北京近郊西山脚下，面积达十七点七公顷，场内设有步枪、小口径运动步枪和手枪人像靶三个射击场，能容纳二千二百个观众。
    射击场的设备都是现代化和电气化的，合乎国际比赛的要求。每个射击手的身旁，都有一架信号操纵器。每个地段裁判员，都有一座电话机，可以随时同靶沟里的裁判员、工作人员取得联系。步枪射击场和小口径运动步枪射击场，各有七十个靶位。手枪人像靶射击场的人像靶，全部用电气操纵。在比赛时，每个射击手在四秒钟内，必须连续射击五个人像靶。刚到四秒钟，人像靶就自动地转成侧面，使打靶者没有再射中的机会了。
