Xinhua News Agency, New York, October 26th (TASS dispatch): According to a United Press report, US President Eisenhower issued the following statement regarding the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Meeting:

    "Three months ago, Secretary of State Dulles and I met with the government leaders of France, Britain, and the Soviet Union in Geneva. The purpose of the meeting, as I said when I announced its opening, was 'to establish a new spirit, so that problems within our responsibilities may be resolved in the future.'

    "The whole world hoped that the meeting had indeed created that new spirit.

    "However, as I said to the American people upon my return, it is a 'serious test' when the foreign ministers, based on our Geneva instructions, specifically deal with those problems for which our four countries are responsible and which, if unresolved, will create tension and danger.

    "Tomorrow, the four foreign ministers will meet in Geneva to continue the work we did not complete in July of this year. They will seek solutions. If that new spirit is real, these solutions are possible. Among these measures, the most important is the unification of Germany within the scope of European security.

    "Secretary of State Dulles and I are in agreement on these issues. We have discussed these issues frequently, and in the past two weeks, he and I have twice studied together the proposals and suggestions that the Western countries will put forward in Geneva. These proposals and suggestions are aimed at promoting a just peace, greater security, and welfare for all. They will reflect a genuine spirit of conciliation and reconciliation. If the Soviet Union responds in the same spirit, great progress can be made. This is my personal hope, and I firmly believe it is also the hope of the American people.

    "We will all follow the developments in Geneva with keen interest, because these developments will be sufficient to show whether the 'Geneva spirit' marks a real shift and whether it will truly produce the peaceful progress that the world is hoping for."

    就四外长会议问题
    艾森豪威尔发表声明
    新华社二十七日讯　塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：据合众社报道，美国总统艾森豪威尔就日内瓦四国外长会议发表下列声明：
    “三个月前，国务卿杜勒斯和我同法国、英国和苏联的政府领袖在日内瓦举行了会议。会议的目的，如我在宣布那次会议开幕时所说的，是要‘建立一种新的精神，使得那些在我们责任范围内的问题在将来可能得到解决’。
    “全世界都希望那次会议事实上的确创造了那种新精神。
    “但是，如我在回国后对美国人民所说的，当外长们根据我们的日内瓦指示具体处理我们四国负有责任而且如果不解决就会产生紧张局势和危险的那些问题时，那才是‘严重的考验’。
    “明天四国外长将在日内瓦举行会议，继续我们在今年七月没有完成的工作。他们将寻求解决办法。如果那种新精神是实在的话，这些解决办法是可能找到的。在这些措施中头等重要的是在欧洲安全的范围内实现德国的统一。
    “国务卿杜勒斯和我在这些问题上的意见是一致的。我们经常讨论这些问题，在过去两星期中，他同我曾经两次在一起研究西方国家将在日内瓦提出的主张和建议。这些主张和建议的目的是要促进正义的和平，使大家有更多的安全和福利。它们将反映真正的调和与和解精神。如果苏联报以同样的精神，那就可以得到很大的进展。这是我个人的希望，我深信这也是美国人民的希望。
    “我们大家将以热切的心情注视日内瓦的情况发展，因为这些情况发展将足以表明，‘日内瓦精神’是否标志着真正的转变，是否将真正产生全世界盼望的和平进展。”
