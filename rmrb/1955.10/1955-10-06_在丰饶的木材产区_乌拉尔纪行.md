    A Trip to the Abundant Timber Region - The Urals
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    Anyone who has traveled on the Trans-Siberian Railway and spent days and nights crossing the endless forests can't help but feel: "The Soviet Union has so much forest!" Indeed, the Soviet Union is the country with the most forests in the world, and its total area now exceeds 1.1 billion hectares.

    The mountains and fields of the Urals are also covered with continuous forests. In the southern Urals, you will see forests of broad-leaved trees and coniferous trees such as birch, linden, elm, maple, and pine. In the central and northern Urals, you will encounter larger and denser coniferous forests of pine and fir. The Molotov Oblast of the Urals is one of the regions with the most forests and the most developed timber harvesting and papermaking industries in the Soviet Union. I witnessed the abundant timber resources of the Soviet Union in this Oblast.

    It takes half a day by train from Molotov City north to the chemical center of Berezniki. The train passes through the oldest steel center of the Urals, Chusovoy, and the main coal mining center, Kizel (the coal from Kizel mixed with coal from Kuznetsk can be made into coke for iron smelting). The train crosses the three tributaries of the Kama River on the east bank—the Chusovoy River, the Kosva River, and the Yaiva River. Along the way, forests of pine and fir, one slope after another, the distant ones like city walls, the near ones like screens, without a minute of interruption.

    After arriving in Berezniki, on a clear morning, I took a car to the nearby Volgokalim timber farm, sixty kilometers away. Stretches of fir forests extended along both sides of the road. Umbrella-shaped, straight, and verdant fir trees were interspersed with slender birch trees. Walking into these refreshing and quiet Russian fir forests can eliminate travel fatigue.
  
    The Volgokalim timber farm is located on the banks of the Yaiva River. I went to the central village of the timber farm with the farm director, Alexander Gusev. In addition to the central village, the timber farm also has two villages near the timber harvesting stations. The appearance of the villages is very similar to that of collective farms. One hundred and fifty lumberjack households raise cows and goats. The entire timber farm has 15,000 square meters of housing, and another 6,000 square meters of housing built by individuals with state assistance. A complete secondary school and seventeen seven-year schools have been established on the timber farm. From the central village, we took a large timber truck to the timber harvesting station. The timber farm's own railway is 65 kilometers long and has five steam locomotives, two motor locomotives, and 150 vehicles.

    The timber harvesting station appeared in the fir forest cleared out. All the work is mechanized. One worker used a crowbar to prop up one side of the tree, and another worker put an electric saw at the end of the trunk. In an instant, the embraceable fir tree was sawn off and fell outward. In a little while, a pile of large trees was sawn down. A giant log-pulling tractor drove over. The driver hooked a pile of trees onto the cable and pulled them away. In this corner of the harvesting station, there were several electric saws and several tractors working. In another corner, winches were operating, replacing the tractors, and pulling away all the trees sawn down in the semi-circular area. All the sawn trees were pulled to the site next to the railway. Workers used electric debranchers to quickly cut off the branches. All the electricity used by the electric saws, electric cutters, winches, etc., was supplied by a generator at the harvesting station. The timber with the branches removed was moved to the train by a crane and transported to the riverbank. The work at the harvesting station was non-stop, day and night. At night, the workers worked under the illumination of searchlights. Electric saw workers carried electric lights with them.

    The lumberjacks are adopting advanced working methods. The most noteworthy are: (1) the one-shift-one-cycle method. This method requires workers to process a certain number of trees in a designated area of forest within eight hours: sawing them down, pulling them away, debranching them, and stacking them or loading them onto the train. This method ensures balanced work and systematic and over-fulfilled production plans. (2) The whole-trunk hauling method. This is a clever way to cherish and save timber. Not long ago, timber was cut into sections at the temporary site of the harvesting station, and a lot of the ends were wasted. Now, the entire trunk is transported to the stack on the riverbank before being cut. There, more experienced people are concentrated, who know how to extract timber rationally and economically. (3) The tree-pulling-with-branches method. This method has been implemented for several years, and its advantage is that it is no longer necessary to leave electric cutting workers in the forest; electric saw workers no longer have to be far away from the production team, and the sawn trees are not lost in the forest. Years of experience have proven that this method greatly improves the labor productivity of electric saw and electric cutting workers and reduces tree loss.

    The train transports the timber from the harvesting station to the riverbank. Here, there is a mechanized timber stack and a well-equipped repair shop. The timber is transported from here to the river beach through a conveyor system. Rafts of wood are piled up like mountains on the river beach. The director of the site said: "This winter, 5,300 railcars of timber have already been harvested and piled on the riverbank, ready to be floated down the Kama River to various parts of the Urals, Stalingrad, and Donbas during the spring flood season. The timber farm plans to harvest 7,000 railcars of timber a year. Obviously, it will greatly exceed the plan."

    There are nearly a hundred mechanized timber harvesting enterprises like the Volgokalim timber farm in the Molotov Oblast. The timber harvested annually by the Molotov Oblast accounts for one-tenth of the total timber production of the Soviet Union. If loaded with train cars, these train cars could stretch all the way from Moscow to Vladivostok. The forests of the Molotov Oblast are so lush that, despite such a large amount of harvesting every year, the trees that grow are still more than those that are harvested.

    Ten to fifteen percent of the timber in the Molotov Oblast is used as mine props, ten percent is used as railroad ties, twenty-five percent is used for building houses, and fifteen percent is used for papermaking.

    The largest papermaking enterprises in the Soviet Union, such as the Kama, Solikamsk, and Krasnoyarsk papermaking integrated plants, are all in the Molotov Oblast. I went to the Kama paper mill and the copper mesh factory that serves the entire Soviet papermaking industry. They are located in Krasnokamsk, near Molotov City.

    The Kama integrated plant uses fir trees to make paper. Crushing the debarked timber, adding acid, cooking it, rinsing it, separating the fibers, bleaching it, and obtaining the pulp - all of this is done with machines, boilers, and conveyor systems. Part of the product of the pulp workshop is pressed into cardboard and transported to other paper mills in the Soviet Union, and a considerable amount is also transported to our country. Another part of the pulp is directly transported to the papermaking workshop, where it is pressed into newsprint on train-like paper machines. There are several paper machines here. The estimated capacity of each machine is to rotate 250 meters per minute, but it actually rotates 280 or 290 meters per minute. The entire workshop produces 0.7 tons of newsprint per minute. The newsprint and writing paper produced by this factory are more than the total output of the entire papermaking industry in Tsarist Russia.

    The brownish-yellow liquid filtered from the pulp initially flowed into the river for nothing, but later it was stored in many large barrels for fermentation, from which alcohol was extracted. The method of extracting alcohol from the waste of pulp saves a large amount of grain for the country.

    In the four years and three months of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Kama integrated plant had already over-fulfilled its plan by 27,000 tons of paper, tens of thousands of tons of pulp, and 1.7 million liters of alcohol.

    The paper machine is covered with a large copper mesh when pressing the paper. The pulp flows over the copper mesh. The finer the copper mesh, the thinner the paper produced. The copper mesh factory is a sophisticated industrial enterprise. In the copper mesh factory, there are skilled technicians who use small drilling machines to drill an accurate fine hole in a diamond the size of a green bean, and constantly check whether the diameter is correct with a microscope. These diamonds of different sizes are installed on many sewing machine-like lathes. These diamond cold-drawing lathes draw copper wires very thin, some less than half a hair. The fine copper wires are tempered with electric current and then woven into copper meshes of different thicknesses on looms like weaving cloth. These copper meshes are simply dazzling "gold silk cloths." The difference is that they are very heavy and must be moved by machines. Moreover, the joints of one piece and another can be sewn or welded together. A worker aligns two pieces of copper mesh, puts a silver wire in the middle, turns on the current, and welds them together in one go, truly "seamless." The technicians from our country's paper mills who are interning here have also learned these technologies.

    在丰饶的木材产区——乌拉尔纪行
    本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    凡是经过西伯利亚铁路，几天几晚穿越那望不断的森林的人们，很少不发生这样的感觉：“苏联的森林真多。”是的，苏联是世界上森林最多的国家，它的总面积现在已经超过十一亿公顷。
    乌拉尔的山野也布满连绵不绝的森林。你在乌拉尔南部会见到白桦、菩提、榆、枫、松等阔叶树和针叶树的森林，在乌拉尔中部和北部会遇到更大更密的松、枞之属的针叶树森林。乌拉尔的莫洛托夫州在苏联是森林最多和木材采伐业、造纸业最发达的地区之一。我在这个州见识了苏联的木材的丰饶面貌。
    从莫洛托夫市往北到化学中心别列兹尼奇市，要乘半天的火车。火车经过乌拉尔的最老的钢铁中心楚索沃伊和主要的煤矿中心基泽尔（基泽尔的煤和库兹涅茨克的煤混合起来，可以制成炼铁用的焦炭）。火车越过卡马河东岸的三个支流——楚索沃伊河、科斯瓦河和雅伊瓦河。一路上，松树和枞树的森林，一坡接着一坡，远的像城墙，近的似屏风，没有一分钟中断过。
    到了别列兹尼奇市以后，在一个晴朗的早晨，乘了汽车向附近的六十公里沃尔古卡林场出发。道路两旁伸展着一片又一片枞树林。伞状的笔直的青翠的枞树，中间夹杂着苗条的白桦树。走进这些清爽、安静的俄罗斯的枞林里，能使人消除旅途的疲劳。
  沃尔古卡林场在雅伊瓦河边。我跟林场场长亚历山得尔·古塞夫到了林场的中心村。除了中心村以外，林场在木材采伐站附近还有两个村。村子的外表很像集体农庄。伐木工人中有一百五十户喂着母牛和母山羊。整个林场有一万五千平方公尺住宅，还有六千平方公尺由个人在国家帮助之下盖起来的住宅。在林场设立一所完全中学和十七所七年制学校。从中心村我们乘了运载木材的大车到木材采伐站去。林场自备的铁路长六十五公里，有五部蒸汽机车、两部摩托机车，和一百五十部车辆。
    木材采伐站出现在被伐出一片空地的枞树森林中。工作全部是机械化的。一位工人用杠子顶住树的一面，另一位工人把电锯放在树干尽头。一瞬眼间，合抱的枞树便被锯断，向外面卧倒。不一会，锯倒了一堆大树。驶过来巨型的拉树拖拉机。司机把一堆树挂上拉索后便拉走了。在采伐站的这一角，有好些电锯和几辆拖拉机活动着。另一角，活动着绞车，它代替拖拉机，把半月形内锯倒的树都拉走了。所有锯倒的树都拉到铁路旁边的场子上。由工人用电力切枝器迅速地切掉树枝。所有电锯、电切、绞车等等用的电力，都是由采伐站的一台发电机供给的。去掉了树枝的木材用起重机搬到火车上，运到河边去。采伐站的工作是昼夜不停的。夜间，工人们在探照灯照耀下工作。电锯工人随身带着电灯。
    伐木工人们采用着先进的工作方法。最值得注意的是：（一）一个工作班一循环的方法。这个方法要求工人们在八小时内把划定的一块林地上的一定数量树木都处理了：锯倒，拉走，去枝和堆好或者放上火车。这个方法保证工作的均衡和生产计划的有系统和超额完成。（二）整个树干的运出方法。这是爱惜和节约木材的聪明做法。不久以前，木材在采伐站的临时场子上就截成几段，头头尾尾作废的很多。现在，整个树干要运到河边的堆栈才截断。那里集中着更有经验的人们，他们知道怎样合理地节约地取材。（三）连枝的拉树方法。这个方法已经实行了几年，它的好处在于：不必再把电切工人留在林中；电锯工人不必再远离生产组，锯倒的树不至于遗失在林中。几年经验证明：这个方法大大提高了电锯和电切工人的劳动生产率并且减少树木的损失。
    火车把采伐站的木材运到河边。这里有机械化的木材堆栈和设备齐全的修理厂。木材从这里经过输送装置放到河滩。河滩上木排堆积如山。场长说：“在这个冬天已经采伐了五千三百车厢的木材，堆积在河边，准备在春天发水时期经过卡马河浮运到乌拉尔、斯大林格勒和顿巴斯各地去。林场一年计划采伐七千车厢木材。显然将大大超过。”
    像沃尔古卡林场这样机械化的木材采伐企业，在莫洛托夫州有近百个。莫洛托夫州每年采伐的木材，为全苏联木材产量的十分之一，如果用火车厢来装载，这些火车厢可以一直从莫斯科排列到海参崴。莫洛托夫州的森林这样茂盛，尽管年年这样大量采伐，长起来的树木，还是比采伐掉的多。
    莫洛托夫州的木材百分之十到十五用作矿井支柱，百分之十用作铁轨枕木，百分之二十五用来建筑房屋，百分之十五用来造纸。
    苏联最大的造纸企业当中如像卡马、苏里卡木斯克、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克这些造纸联合工厂，都在莫洛托夫州。我到了卡马造纸厂和为全苏联造纸工业服务的铜网厂。它们在莫洛托夫市附近的克拉斯诺卡木斯克。
    卡马联合工厂是用枞树来造纸的。把去掉树皮的木材弄碎，加酸，煮过，冲洗，分出纤维，漂白，得出纸浆，——这一切都是用机器、锅炉、输送装置来工作的。纸浆车间的一部分产品压成纸板，运到苏联其他造纸厂，也有不少运到我国。另一部分纸浆直接输送到造纸车间，在列车式的造纸机上压制成白报纸。这里造纸机器有几部。每部机器预计能力是每分钟转二百五十公尺，实际转二百八、九十公尺。全车间每分钟出产零点七吨白报纸。这里工厂出产的白报纸和写字纸，比沙皇俄国时代全国造纸工业出产的还多。
    从纸浆滤下的褐黄色的液体，起初白白地流到河里去，后来蓄在许多大桶里发酵，从这里提炼酒精。利用纸浆的废料提炼酒精的方法，为国家节约大量的粮食。
    卡马联合工厂在第五个五年计划的四年又三个月当中已经超计划多产了二万七千吨纸，几万吨纸浆，一百七十万公升酒精。
    造纸机在压制纸张时候，铺着大幅铜网。纸浆流过铜网上面。铜网愈细，产的纸也愈薄。铜网制造厂是精细的工业企业。在铜网厂有高明的技工，他用小钻床在绿豆大的金钢石上钻穿一个口径准确的细孔，不时用显微镜检查口径是否端正。这些口径大小不一的金钢石被装在许多缝纫机似的车床上。这些金钢石的冷拔车床把铜丝拉得很细，有的还不到半根头发那么细。细铜丝用电流锻炼，然后在织机上像织布一般织成粗细不一的铜网。这些铜网简直是一匹匹耀眼的“金丝布”。所不同的是它们很重，要用机器来搬动。而且，一匹和另一匹的接头可以缝起来，也可以焊起来。一位工人把两块铜网对好，中间放上一根银丝，通上电流，一下子就焊接好了，真是“天衣无缝”。在这里实习的我国造纸厂的技工，也学会了这些技术。
