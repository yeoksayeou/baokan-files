    Trade Between West Germany and Peaceful Democratic Countries
    Xi Linsheng
    The results of the recent talks in Moscow between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany have been welcomed by broad sections of the population in West Germany. They believe that the establishment of normal relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union will not only help promote friendship and cooperation between the two countries, but also help restore and develop West Germany's trade with the Soviet Union, thereby opening the way for West Germany to conduct extensive trade with other countries in the socialist camp.

    Germany and the Soviet Union, as well as the countries of Eastern Europe, have a long tradition of economic ties. To name just one example, in 1931, the Soviet Union purchased 35 percent of Germany's total production of machine tools and more than 20 percent of its total production of electrical industry products, while exporting large quantities of food, raw materials, and semi-finished products to Germany. Other Eastern European countries had even closer trade relations with Germany. In 1932, Germany's exports to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries accounted for about 22 percent of its total exports, and imports accounted for about 19 percent. This large-scale trade between Germany and the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries before the war was of great benefit to the development of the German economy.

    However, since the Second World War, the traditional trade relations between Germany and the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries have been artificially disrupted. The division of Germany into two parts has created two different situations in Germany's foreign trade. The German Democratic Republic pursues a policy of developing economic ties with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and now maintains trade relations with nearly one hundred countries, and has concluded long-term trade agreements with twenty capitalist countries. At the same time, its trade with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries is constantly developing. The trade volume between the German Democratic Republic and other countries in the socialist camp has more than doubled from 1950 to 1954, and its trade volume with the Soviet Union reached a huge amount of 4.286 billion rubles in 1954. This extensive trade ensures that the German Democratic Republic obtains the machinery, raw materials, and grain it needs, and provides its industrial products with a broad sales market, which greatly promotes the economic development of the German Democratic Republic. But in West Germany, the situation is different. The traditional trade relations between the two parts of Germany and between Germany and the East have been artificially restricted, and the economy is unilaterally tied to the West. In the Western capitalist market, the general economic crisis, increasingly fierce competition, and mutual resistance are making international trade activities increasingly difficult.

    At present, West Germany's exports to countries in the socialist camp account for only 1.6 percent of its total exports, and imports account for only 1.7 percent. The interruption of traditional trade relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries has certainly caused great damage to West Germany's economy. The raw materials and grain that West Germany could have imported from the Eastern market now have to be sought in the Western market. For example, in 1932, 87 percent of Germany's rye imports came from the Soviet Union and Poland; while today, 94 percent of West Germany's imports of this kind have to be imported from the United States, Canada, and Argentina, which are far away. Germany could have exchanged its manufactured goods for the goods it needed in the Eastern market, but now it has to pay in US dollars. Moreover, West Germany has to pay much higher prices than the world market when it buys grain and raw materials from the United States. For example, the price of one ton of grain on the world market is 84 US dollars, but the United States charges West Germany 130 US dollars. West Germany imports several million tons of coal from the United States every year, and its price is 20 marks per ton higher than West German coal. If West Germany imports the same coal from the Soviet Union, the price would be much cheaper. This one-sided economic relationship in West Germany has greatly affected West Germany's economy. According to Adenauer himself, the losses suffered by West Germany due to restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are nearly 345 million US dollars per year.

    In recent years, West Germany's ever-increasing industrial production capacity requires a broad foreign market. West Germany's continuous expansion of exports has made it the third largest exporting country in the capitalist world. West Germany's exports in 1954 accounted for 6.5 percent of the total exports of the capitalist world. However, this expansion of West Germany's exports has been achieved under fierce competition with other capitalist countries. And the further expansion of West German exports has felt the limitations of the shrinking capitalist world market. West Germany's "German Daily and Economic News" pointed out: "The further expansion of West German exports is limited by Western purchasing power." In this regard, it is worth pointing out that West Germany's exports in the first five months of this year have been stagnant, and in April of this year, there was the first trade deficit since 1951. This situation cannot but cause concern among many bourgeois people in West Germany. Under such circumstances, the voice of West German business people demanding trade with peaceful democratic countries is getting higher and higher. In May of this year, West German Federal Parliament member Rademacher emphasized that West Germany "must trade with the East to maintain our current income level." Hamburg shipping magnate Brenme also said: "Restoring relations with our old trading partners in the East is what our economy needs most." More than 500 West German companies have signed their names to advocate the establishment of trade relations with the Soviet Union.

    The restoration of trade between West Germany and the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries is fully possible. In contrast to the capitalist countries that are constantly attacked by economic crises, the national economies of the socialist camp countries are flourishing, production is constantly growing, and the people's purchasing power is increasing day by day. Therefore, these countries not only have more and more abundant materials available for export, but also have a huge appetite for selling foreign goods. In particular, the Soviet Union, China, and other People's Democratic countries have consistently pursued a trade policy of equality and mutual benefit, which guarantees the broad prospects for them to develop economic ties with all countries. The rapid growth of these countries' foreign trade volume in recent years is a good illustration. In 1953, the total amount of the Soviet Union's foreign trade was almost four times the pre-war level, and during the same period, our country's trade with capitalist countries also increased by 52 percent compared to the previous year. As the Soviet Union is about to implement a new five-year plan, and our country and the People's Democratic countries are also carrying out large-scale economic construction, this will further expand the volume of foreign trade in these countries. The consistent upward development of the economies of the countries in the socialist camp provides the most reliable and stable market, as the West German "Democratic Forum" in Bremen recently pointed out: "The socialist economic structure is free from crises, so it can maintain lasting and solid trade relations, unaffected by the crises of capitalist countries." Any statement that there is no prospect for the development of trade between West Germany and the East is unfounded. And in fact, since last year, although there is no formal agreement between the Soviet Union and West Germany, trade has continued to grow. West Germany's exports to the Soviet Union have increased from 7 million marks in 1953 to 52.8 million marks in 1954. Imports have also increased from 65.7 million marks to 93.1 million marks. At the same time, trade with China and the People's Democratic countries has also increased. However, under the current restrictions, the trade volume is far from the level that could be developed. If West Germany is willing to take positive action, it can greatly expand its trade volume with the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, and rapidly develop this mutually beneficial economic relationship, which is obviously very beneficial to the development of the West German economy, which is facing increasingly serious market problems.

    西德和和平民主国家间的贸易
    席林生
    苏联和德意志联邦共和国最近在莫斯科会谈取得的结果得到了西德各阶层广大人士的欢迎。他们认为西德和苏联之间正常关系的建立不仅有助于促进两国之间的友好和合作，而且也有助于恢复和发展西德跟苏联的贸易，从而打开西德与社会主义阵营其他国家进行广泛的贸易的道路。
    德国和苏联以及东欧各国的经济联系有悠久的传统。远的不说，在一九三一年，苏联就曾经购买了德国机器工具全部生产的百分之三十五以及电气工业全部生产的百分之二十以上，而对德国输出大量食物、原料及半制成品。其他东欧国家同德国的贸易关系则还要密切。一九三二年德国对苏联和东欧国家的输出，约占它出口总额的百分之二十二，输入约为百分之十九。德国同苏联和东欧国家在战前所进行的这种大规模的贸易对于德国经济的发展是有莫大好处的。
    但是从第二次大战以后，德国同苏联和东欧国家的传统贸易关系遭到了人为的破坏。德国的分裂为两部分，使德国的对外贸易形成了两种不同的局面。德意志民主共和国奉行在平等互利的基础上同一切国家发展经济联系的政策，现在已和将近一百个国家保持着贸易的往来，并同二十个资本主义国家订有长期的贸易协定。同时它和苏联、中国及人民民主国家的贸易不断得到发展。德意志民主共和国和社会主义阵营其他国家的贸易额，从一九五○年到一九五四年已增加二倍以上，它和苏联的贸易额在一九五四年达到了四十二亿八千六百万卢布的巨大数目。这种广泛的贸易往来，保证了德意志民主共和国获得所需要的机器、原料和粮食，并使它的工业制成品获得宽广的销售的市场，这大大促进了德意志民主共和国的经济发展。但是在西德却是另外一种情况。原来德国东西两部分之间以及德国和东方的传统的贸易关系被人为地限制，经济片面地系于西方。而在西方资本主义市场上，普遍的经济危机、日益剧烈的竞争和相互抵制，使国际贸易活动愈来愈困难。
    现在西德对社会主义阵营国家的输出仅占其出口总额的百分之一点六，输入仅为百分之一点七。同苏联和人民民主国家的传统贸易关系的中断当然使西德的经济遭到很大的损害。西德本来可以从东方市场进口的原料和粮食，现在必须转向西方市场中去寻求。如在一九三二年德国百分之八十七的裸麦入口是来自苏联和波兰；而今天西德的这种进口，百分之九十四要遥远地从美国、加拿大和阿根廷输入。德国本来可以把它的制成品向东方市场换取它所需要的物品，现在却要用美元来支付。而且西德向美国购买粮食和原料的时候要付出比世界市场高得多的价格。例如一吨谷粒在世界市场上的价格是八十四美元，但美国向西德索价一百三十美元。西德一年要从美国输入几百万吨的煤，其价格比西德煤每吨要高出二十马克。如果西德从苏联输入同样的煤，其价格要便宜得多。西德的这种片面经济联系使西德的经济大受影响。据阿登纳自己承认，由于限制对苏联和各人民民主国家进行贸易而使西德遭受的损失，每年将近三亿四千五百万美元。
    近年来，西德经济日益增大的工业生产能力需要一个广阔的国外市场。西德不断扩大输出，已使它一跃而为资本主义世界中第三个最大的输出国。西德一九五四年的输出额，占了资本主义世界输出总额的百分之六点五。但是西德的这种输出的扩增，是在同其他资本主义国家激烈竞争的情况下取得的。而西德出口的进一步扩大，已感受到日益缩小的资本主义世界市场的限制。西德的“德意志日报与经济报”就指出：“西德出口的进一步扩展已受到西方购买力的限制”。在这方面值得指出的是，西德今年最初五个月的输出一直停滞不前，并且在今年四月出现了从一九五一年以来第一次的贸易入超。这种情况不能不引起西德许多资产阶级人士的忧虑。在这种情况下，西德企业界人士中要求同和平民主国家进行贸易的呼声越来越高。今年五月西德联邦议院议员拉德马赫就曾强调说：西德“必须和东方进行贸易以保持我们目前的收入水平。”汉堡大航运商布伦梅也说：“和我们东方的老的贸易对手恢复关系是我们经济上所最需要的。”西德有五百多家公司签名主张同苏联建立贸易关系。
    恢复西德同苏联、中国和人民民主国家的贸易是有着充分的可能性的。和遭受经济危机的不断袭击的资本主义国家相反，社会主义阵营各国的国民经济在欣欣向荣，生产不断增长，人民购买力日益提高。因此，这些国家不但有着愈来愈充足的物资可供出口，同时也有着销纳外国商品的巨大胃口。特别是苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家一贯奉行平等互利的贸易政策，这保证了它们和一切国家发展经济联系的广阔前途。这些国家的对外贸易额近年来在迅速增长，就是很好的说明。一九五三年，苏联对外贸易的总额几乎为战前水平四倍，在同一期间我国和资本主义国家的贸易也比前一年增加了百分之五十二。由于苏联将开始实行新的五年计划，我国和各人民民主国家也正在进行大规模经济建设，这将使这些国家对外贸易量更加扩大。社会主义阵营国家经济的一贯的向上发展，提供了最可靠和最稳定的市场，正如西德不来梅的“民主论坛报”最近所指出的：“社会主义经济结构是没有危机的，这样就能够保持持久的和巩固的贸易关系，不受资本主义国家的危机的影响。”任何关于西德与东方贸易没有发展前途的说法都是毫无根据的。而且事实上，去年以来苏联和西德的贸易虽然没有正式的协定，它仍然在不断增长。西德对苏联的输出，已由一九五三年的七百万马克增加到一九五四年的五千二百八十万马克。输入也由六千五百七十万马克增加到九千三百一十万马克。同时对中国和人民民主国家的贸易也有增加。不过在目前受限制的情况下，贸易额距离可能发展的水平是很远的。如果西德愿意采取积极的行动，就可以大大扩大它同苏联、中国和人民民主国家的贸易额，并使这种互利的经济联系迅速发展起来，这对于正遭遇日益严重的市场问题的西德经济的发展显然是十分有利的。
