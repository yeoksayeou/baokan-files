After getting off work every day, the workers of the Casting Department of the Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant would gather in front of the team's economic accounting competition bulletin board to see how each team had performed in the past day in terms of output, quality, repair rate, raw material consumption, safety, and other major indicators. On the bulletin board, the completion of each indicator was marked with the value of RMB. At a glance, the workers could see how much wealth their team had created for the country in the past day, whether there had been any waste, and how they compared to other teams. If the bulletin board was all written in white characters (indicating wealth created for the country), everyone would leave the bulletin board with laughter and talk, and fatigue would disappear with the pleasant mood. If red characters appeared on the bulletin board (indicating waste), everyone would seriously ask each other: What happened? The next day at work, they would definitely find the cause of the waste and come up with ways to improve.

This team economic accounting competition board is like a flag, encouraging workers to strive for the comprehensive fulfillment of national plan indicators, to overcome waste, and to create greater accumulation for the country. In the past, the leadership called on workers to comprehensively fulfill the national plan, and the workers also knew that they should comprehensively fulfill the national plan. But in reality, what they thought about most at that time was how to increase production, improve quality, and pay attention to safety. As for reducing costs, the impression in their minds was more abstract, and they even believed that reducing costs was the business of cost accounting personnel and had nothing to do with themselves. Workers often said: Casting a few more iron pipes and producing fewer rejects is all that matters, a little waste is inevitable, it's nothing to worry about. Indeed, if you walked into the production workshops of the first and second pipe fields of the Casting Department at that time, you could see pieces of scrap iron, several meters long of grass rope for winding cores, paper rolls for winding cores, half-new cotton gloves, masks, broom heads, etc. everywhere. In one or two days, dozens of kilograms of molten iron would be spilled on the ground. The furnace ash was mixed with a large amount of unburnt coke. Everyone was accustomed to these wasteful phenomena. Due to the workers' poor cost awareness, the raw material management system was also not strictly enforced. For example, a quota-based material requisition system was stipulated, but workers did not weigh the materials they requisitioned. Even if they did weigh them, they would loosely calculate five and a half jin as five jin or six jin. Therefore, the consumption of raw materials could not be accurately calculated, and the cost fluctuated greatly. Last year, the unit cost of straight pipes in the first pipe field sometimes exceeded the plan by more than 17%, and sometimes it was more than 7% lower than the plan. The cost accounting personnel also did not go deep into the workshops, but sat in the office all day long calculating and using calculating machines. At the end of the month, they would compile the materials reported by each workshop, so they could only understand the "general" reasons for the cost fluctuations, but could not find the real reasons. Except for going to the accounting team to find out if the wages were calculated incorrectly, the workers rarely had contact with the accounting team. Sometimes, when the comrades of the accounting team happened to go to the workshop, the workers would ask strangely: What are they here for?

In October last year, the Casting Department began to promote the team economic accounting competition. The workers saw that this method could calculate their daily labor results in RMB and could also discover problems in production. They felt that they "had a clear understanding in their minds," that "the competition had a clear direction," and that "the evaluation also had a reliable basis." Therefore, they were very enthusiastic and motivated from the beginning. Whether on the road or in the cafeteria, you could hear workers talking about the competition. By November, there had been a significant improvement in production, output had increased a lot, the task of completing the task in terms of the finished product rate was completely reversed in the first four months, and safety accidents were also significantly reduced. But only one thing was the most distressing, that is, the consumption of the main raw material—molten iron—still often exceeded the prescribed quota. The workers of the two pipe fields were worried about this matter, and everyone wanted to break through this link and win the red flag of excellence. The workers of the second pipe field first discovered that the reason for the high consumption quota of molten iron was that when the workers poured molten iron, they sprinkled it on the ground in order to be quick and save trouble. So the workers improved the operation method of pouring molten iron, so as not to spill the molten iron on the ground, and also made a sieve to sieve out the iron beans sprinkled on the ground from the sand every day. In this way, the consumption of molten iron was reduced somewhat, but it still often exceeded the quota. How exactly was the molten iron being wasted? In order to study this problem, everyone started from how much molten iron was received in a day, how many pipes were cast, and how much molten iron was used, and learned that the molten iron actually occupied by the cast pipes only accounted for 82% of the molten iron received. The remaining molten iron was taken up by the pouring gate and the cutting head that needed to be cut off at the upper end of the pipe. After each pipe was cast, a 34-kilogram cutting head had to be cut off. This pipe head had to be cut off. This problem, which no one had thought about in the past, now attracted everyone's attention. The workers of the second pipe field started by improving the operating methods. Foreman Chen Yuda suggested changing the specifications of the core for making iron pipes, shrinking the position of the cutting head (mud core head) at one end by 50 cm, and lowering the position of the mold gate by dozens of centimeters. After research by technicians and workers, it was believed that this suggestion was very good, so the whole field changed to use the new specifications of the core head. As a result, each cutting head of the manufactured pipe saved more than 21 kilograms compared to the past, and the consumption of molten iron quickly dropped. In March of this year alone, the second pipe field saved more than 70 tons of molten iron for the country. The first pipe field produced thin pipes, which could not be changed like the second pipe field, but they also improved the gate mold tool under the inspiration of the second pipe field. As a result, it used about 4 kilograms less molten iron per pipe than the second pipe field's method of reducing the cutting head. Now, the first and second pipe fields can save 164 tons of molten iron every month. The raw material molten iron consumption column on the team economic accounting competition board rarely shows red characters.

This technical improvement also helped to overcome the difficulty of insufficient molten iron raw materials. In the past, the Casting Department's melting furnace could not supply enough molten iron to the first and second pipe casting fields. If the first pipe field used more, the second pipe field would have to use less; if the second pipe field used more, the first pipe field would have to use less. Now, because the molten iron of the first and second pipe fields has been saved, plus the equipment of the melting furnace has also been improved, the molten iron supply is now completely sufficient.

The workers have strengthened their cost awareness in the process of the team economic accounting competition, especially from the solution of the above-mentioned key production problems. They didn't understand cost in the past, but now they understand cost. They didn't care about cost in the past, but now they care about cost. Once the workers care about the cost, they will try their best to block all wasteful loopholes, and will not let go of even the smallest places. If you walk into their workshop again now, you will no longer see several meters long of grass rope thrown around everywhere. The workers even connect the rope ends used for bundling grass ropes to use; masks are washed and reused when they are dirty; cotton gloves are worn out and turned over to use the other side; in the past, the kerosene used for washing hands in a workshop needed two liters a week, but now two liters can be used for a month; in the past, a workshop issued two brooms every day, but now two brooms are enough for a week. The furnace workers carefully sieve out the unburnt coke from the furnace ash and continue to burn it. The output and quality of cast pipes have increased significantly, and the cost has decreased even more significantly. Comparing the six months before the implementation of the team economic accounting with the six months after the implementation of the team economic accounting, the output increased by 2.83% to 4.7%, the finished product rate increased by 2.1%, and the production cost actually decreased by more than 3.5%.

### 工人们有了成本观念以后

    工人们有了成本观念以后
    郝洁
    每天下班以后，北京石景山钢铁厂铸造部的工人们，就都围拢到班组经济核算竞赛公布牌前去，看看每个班在昨天一天内，产量、质量、待修率、原材料消耗、安全等各项主要指标完成的情况。公布牌上，每项指标完成情况都用人民币的价值标示出来，工人们一看，就会知道自己的班组在昨天一天内，到底为国家创造了多少财富，有没有浪费，比起别的班组来又怎样？如果公布牌上都是写的白色字（表示为国家创造的财富），大家就连说带笑地离开公布牌，疲劳也随着愉快的心情而消失了；如果公布牌上出现了红色字（表示浪费），大家就很认真地互相问着：怎么搞的呀？第二天一上班，他们一定找出浪费的原因，想出改进的办法。
    这个班组经济核算竞赛牌像一面旗帜一样，鼓舞着工人为全面完成国家计划指标，为克服浪费、争取给国家创造更大的积累而努力。过去，领导上号召工人全面完成国家计划，工人们也知道应该全面完成国家计划，但实际上，那时候在他们脑子里想得最多的是如何增加产量，提高质量，注意安全，至于降低成本，在他们脑子里的印象就比较抽象了，甚至认为降低成本是成本核算人员的事，跟自己无关。工人们常说：多铸几根铁管，少出一点废品，就什么都有了，浪费一星半点在所难免，算不了什么。的确，如果你在那时候走进铸造部一、二管场的生产车间，随处都可以看到成块的废铁、几公尺长的缠芯子用的草绳子、缠芯子用的纸卷、半新的棉手套、口罩、扫帚头等。一、二天内，洒在地上的铁水，就有几十公斤。炉灰里掺着大量没烧透的焦炭。对于这些浪费现象，大家都习惯了。由于工人成本观念差，原材料管理制度也不认真执行。例如规定了限额领料制度，但工人领料不过秤，即使过了秤，明明五斤半，也会马马虎虎地给算成五斤或六斤。因此，原材料消耗量无法统计得准确，成本忽高忽低。去年一管场的直管单位成本，有时竟由超计划百分之十七多，一下降又比计划节约百分之七多。成本核算人员也不深入车间，整天坐在办公室里打算盘，摇计算机，月终根据各车间上报的材料往一块统计，所以，他们只能了解成本忽高忽低的“大概”原因，却找不出真正原因。工人除了因工资算错了去找核算组以外，平常很少同核算组发生关系，有时核算组的同志偶然到车间去一趟，工人就会奇怪地问：他们是来干什么的？
    去年十月里，铸造部开始推行班组经济核算竞赛。工人们看到这个办法可以把自己每天的劳动成果用人民币核算出来，又可以发现生产中的问题，感到“心中有谱了”，“竞赛有了明确的方向”，
  “评比也有了可靠的根据”。所以，他们一开始情绪就很高，干劲很大，无论在路上，在食堂里，都可以听到工人们谈论着竞赛的事。到十一月份，生产就有了显著的好转，产量提高了很多，在成品率方面完全扭转了前四个月完不成任务的局面，安全事故也显著减少了。但只有一件事最令人苦恼，就是主要原材料——铁水的消耗量还经常超过规定的定额。两个管场的工人都为这事着急，谁都想突破这一环，获得优胜红旗。二管场工人首先发现铁水消耗定额高的原因，在于工人倒铁水时，为了抢快和省事，沥沥拉拉地洒到地上去了。于是工人们就改进了倒铁水的操作方法，不使铁水洒在地上，并且还做了个筛子，每天把撒在地上的铁豆从沙土里筛出来。这样，铁水的消耗量减少了一些，但还经常超过定额。铁水究竟是怎样浪费的呢？为了研究这个问题，大家就从一天领多少铁水，铸了多少根管子，用掉多少铁水算起，知道了铸成的管子实际占用的铁水只占领用的铁水的百分之八十二。其余的铁水是管子上端需要切掉的浇口和切头占去了。每根管子铸好后都要切掉三十四公斤重的切头，这个管头非切不可。这个过去谁也没有想过的问题，现在竟引起大家的注意了。二管场的工人从改进操作方法入手，工长陈玉达建议把制铁管子的芯子规格改变一下，把一端切头（泥芯头）的位置向下缩五十公分，再把管模水口位置降低几十公分。经技术员和工人研究，认为这个建议很好，于是全场就改用了新规格的芯头，结果制成的管子每根切头部分比过去节约了二十一公斤多，铁水的消耗量迅速下降了，只今年三月份，二管场就为国家节约了七十多吨铁水。一管场生产的是细管子，不能像二管场那样改，但他们也在二管场的启示下，改进了水口模工具，结果比二管场缩小切头的办法每根又少用了约四公斤的铁水。现在一、二两个管场每月可节约铁水一百六十四吨。班组经济核算竞赛牌上的原材料铁水消耗一栏就很少出现红字了。
    这项技术改进，同时帮助了克服铁水原料不足的困难。过去，铸造部熔铁炉不能供给一、二两个铸管场以足够的铁水。一管场用多了，二管场就得少用一些；二管场用多了，一管场就得少用一些。现在，由于一、二两个管场的铁水节约了，加上熔炉的设备也有了改进，铁水供应已经完全可以够用了。
    工人们从班组经济核算竞赛的过程中，特别是从以上生产关键问题的解决过程中，加强了成本观念。他们过去不懂成本，现在懂得了成本，过去不关心成本，现在关心成本了。工人们一关心了成本，就会想尽办法把一切浪费的漏洞都堵死，连最细小的地方也不放过。如果现在你再走进他们的车间，再也看不见几公尺长的草绳子随处乱抛了，工人们连捆草绳子用的绳头都接起来使用；口罩用脏了，洗干净了再用；棉手套戴破了，掉过来再用那面；过去一个车间洗手用的煤油，一星期需要两公升，现在两公升可以用一个月；过去一个车间每天发两把扫帚，这会儿一星期两把就够了。烘炉工人在炉灰里细心地把没有烧透的焦炭筛出来继续烧。铸管产量、质量有了显著上升，成本更有显著下降。以推行班组经济核算前的半年间同推行班组经济核算后的半年相比较，产量提高了百分之二点八三到百分之四点七，成品率提高了百分之二点一，而生产成本竟降低了百分之三点五以上。
