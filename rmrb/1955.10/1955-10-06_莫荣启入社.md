Since Xujia Township in Macheng County, Hubei Province, successively established sixteen agricultural production cooperatives in recent years, the poor peasant Mo Rongqi gradually had the idea of joining a cooperative. Whenever he went to the city to buy and sell things and passed by agricultural cooperatives such as "Dawn" and "May Fourth", seeing how well-organized the lives were in the cooperative and how well the crops grew, he always thought: "If I also joined the cooperative and cultivated the fields well, harvested more grain, and improved my own life, and could sell more surplus grain to the country, how great would that be?"

Mo Rongqi still had great difficulties in production and life. He was an old farmer who had worked as a hired laborer for twenty-two years. He could never cultivate the six acres of land he was allocated during the land reform well. The old couple were already over fifty, and their son was not yet twenty and not very strong; moreover, they lacked cattle and farm tools. How could they cultivate the land well? From 1953 to the present, he had participated in a mutual aid group, which was better than working alone, but life was still difficult, so he was a poor peasant during the land reform, and he was still a poor peasant now.

He had been considering the issue of joining a cooperative for two years. From the spring to the summer of this year, he was ninety percent sure that he would join. To be cautious, before harvesting the rice, he personally went to visit his relative, his cousin Liu Yonghu, to inquire in detail about various aspects of the cooperative. Liu Yonghu was the vice-chairman of the May Fourth Agricultural Cooperative. He enthusiastically told his cousin about the various policies within the cooperative and also advised Mo Rongqi to join.

After visiting his cousin, Mo Rongqi made up his mind to join a cooperative this year. However, near the Badouqiu hamlet where he lived, no cooperative had yet been established. If he were to take the lead in organizing a cooperative himself, he did not have the ability, so he had to wait patiently.

When it was time to harvest the rice, he suddenly heard the good news that the Gan Benyou mutual aid group in the neighboring hamlet was going to convert into a cooperative, and he was very happy. His fields were close to the fields of the Gan Benyou mutual aid group, and one large field was even in the middle of their mutual aid group's fields. One day, while he was harvesting rice in the field, he met Gan Benyou, and he asked Gan Benyou with a smile, "I heard that you are going to convert into a cooperative, can I join?" Gan Benyou also said with a smile, "The cooperative door is wide open, if you want to join, how can we not accept you?" Having received Gan Benyou's reply, he was overjoyed and, as he left, he told him, "Let me know when you have a meeting." When he came home, he lectured his son like a member of the cooperative, saying to his son, "The cooperative rewards more work with more pay, do as much as you can. With more people and unified minds, the strength is greater. Cultivating the fields well is good for ourselves and good for the country." He did not hide this pleasant news from his neighbors. In one day, everyone knew that Mo Rongqi was going to join the agricultural cooperative.

II

Since Gan Benyou replied that he could join the cooperative, there had been no news for several days, and Mo Rongqi was very anxious. It happened that Comrade Song from the county committee working group came to work in their electoral district. He made a request to Comrade Song to join the cooperative, and Comrade Song casually said, "You can." Mo Rongqi asked Comrade Song to help him write an application to join the cooperative and send it to Gan Benyou, as he thought this would be more reliable. Comrade Song said, "Just say it, no need to write an application."

However, after Comrade Song agreed, there was still no progress on the matter of joining the cooperative. Mo Rongqi went to see Gan Benyou twice. The first time he went to see Gan Benyou, Gan Benyou was talking to Comrade Song. Gan Benyou casually replied to him, "Come to your house tomorrow night to talk." The next day, he asked his son to exchange two eggs for seven cigarettes at a peddler's stand and waited for Gan Benyou. He waited from dusk until dark, and from dark until late at night, but Gan Benyou did not appear. On the third day, he could not bear it any longer and, despite the fact that he was suffering from malaria, he went to find Gan Benyou with a hoe. Gan Benyou was planting buckwheat in the field. Mo Rongqi still asked politely, "How about my joining the cooperative?" Gan Benyou was very embarrassed. He had previously discussed Mo Rongqi's request to join the cooperative with the group members, but two middle-peasant households disagreed. As they were preparing to convert into a cooperative, he did not dare to make a decision on his own, so he had to deal with Mo Rongqi by saying, "Although your fields are close, you live a little further away, and it will take time to eat and walk later, and it will also be inconvenient to attend meetings." Mo Rongqi said, "Deduct my share for the missed work. Even if it is windy or rainy, I guarantee I will attend the meetings." Gan Benyou had to change the subject and said, "I don't understand some of the policies yet, go ask Comrade Song." "Where is Old Song?"

"Old Song has gone to the county to attend a meeting and will not be back for a month or two."

Mo Rongqi was eager to join the cooperative, and the next day he went to the city to find Comrade Song. When he arrived at the place where the county meeting was being held, he asked everyone he met where Comrade Song was. Others said, "There are many people with the surname Song, which one are you looking for, what's his name?" This stumped him. Although he had seen Comrade Song many times, he had never asked his name. Helpless, he waited at the gate of the meeting hall, seeing many people coming and going at the gate, but he did not see Comrade Song. He waited until noon, with no hope, and then walked back dejectedly.

He was very annoyed, could it really be that he couldn't join the cooperative? His neighbor Xiao Yongda knew about his request to join the cooperative, and now seeing him run into so many snags, he joked with him, "Gan Benyou said the door of the cooperative is open, I see that the cooperative door is now bolted shut, you don't even think about getting in." Xiao Yongda was speaking in jest, but Mo Rongqi took it seriously, and he said stubbornly, "As long as it is a cooperative led by the Communist Party, I will always be able to join."

Comrade Song was not there; Gan Benyou did not give a straightforward answer; and others made fun of him: Mo Rongqi felt that there was really nothing he could do. One day, he heard from someone that Gan Benyou's group would elect Wang Kaiyan as the head of the cooperative in the future. He suddenly found another way and went to find Wang Kaiyan. But Wang Kaiyan also declined, saying, "Twenty households in our cooperative are already enough, we don't want more." Mo Rongqi said anxiously, "Can't you take me in? My field is so close to your field, how great is that!" Wang Kaiyan was an honest man and couldn't tell a lie. Seeing that Mo Rongqi was pressing him, he had to tell the truth. He said that originally some people in their group agreed to him joining the cooperative, but two middle-peasant households disagreed, saying that Mo Rongqi had a bad mouth and liked to speak frankly; Gan Benyou couldn't make up his mind, and the matter had not been decided. This made Mo Rongqi suddenly realize that the reason why the two middle-peasant households disagreed with him joining the cooperative was that, during the unified grain purchase last year, he had reported to the working comrades that these two middle-peasant households had concealed their output and speculated on grain. He thought, "No wonder Gan Benyou didn't reply to my request to join the cooperative, it turns out someone was speaking ill of me behind my back." From then on, he knew that it was not enough to just find the people from the Gan Benyou mutual aid group, he also had to find the working comrades.

Afterwards, he met seven or eight township staff members in his electoral district, including party member Guo Wanxiang, township branch committee member Lan Caishan, and branch secretary Zhou Mingshan. Whenever he met these staff members, he asked them to help him join the cooperative. But each time, he was unable to get his request fulfilled. Some people told him to "wait patiently"; some said that his enthusiasm for joining the cooperative was good; and some told him to discuss it with Gan Benyou again...

Thinking about the difficulty of joining the cooperative, he really felt a little disheartened. He thought, "Joining the cooperative is really more difficult than borrowing grain from people when there's nothing to eat in the spring. I've begged grandpa and grandma, I'm just short of kneeling down and kowtowing." But when he thought that if he didn't join the cooperative this year, he still wouldn't be able to do well in production next year, he mustered up his courage again.

Soon, Xujia Township carried out the "three fixings" (fixing of production, purchase, and sales quotas) for grain, and Mo Rongqi met Comrade Song again. He was overjoyed and asked Comrade Song to help him join the cooperative. However, Comrade Song said coldly to him, "I don't know whether your active request to join the cooperative is real or not, I need to test you in the 'three fixings' work." Mo Rongqi was not angry; after listening to Comrade Song's words, he did indeed help the working group with some work in the "three fixings" work.

III

The "three fixings" work in Xujia Township was nearing its end. The work of converting the Gan Benyou mutual aid group into a cooperative was also progressing actively. The peasants were waiting for the rain to plow the fields and plant wheat. However, Mo Rongqi's joining the cooperative had been forgotten by everyone again.

Mo Rongqi had run into many snags and didn't want to ask anyone for help anymore. He felt very wronged, he thought: "Why don't they want me to join the cooperative? In terms of class background, I have always been a poor peasant; in terms of history, I worked as a hired laborer for twenty-two years. Isn't that enough to meet the conditions for joining the cooperative? Is it just because I am poor that they won't let me join the cooperative?" The more he thought about it, the more unwilling he was, and he was planning one last fight. He calculated: once the Gan Benyou mutual aid group has been converted into a cooperative, he would go to the township government to file a complaint, asking them "why don't you want me to join the cooperative?" If the township government didn't work, he would go to the district office, if the district office didn't work, he would go to the county government, and if the government said "because you are poor, you can't join the cooperative", then he would be satisfied.

Just as Mo Rongqi was full of resentment and had nowhere to vent, on the afternoon of September 19th, he received a notice asking him to go to the township government for a meeting in the evening.

The gas lamp illuminated the large room of the township government brightly. The room was full of people, some from inside the cooperative, some from outside, but all of them were peasants who still had difficulties in life and production. At the meeting, the head of the working group conveyed the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the issue of agricultural cooperativization. The township branch secretary made a self-criticism at the meeting, admitting that the township branch had not well implemented the class policy in running the cooperative in the past, and had made the mistake of excluding poor peasants. He asked everyone to criticize the branch. He also represented all party members in expressing that they would resolutely rely on poor peasants, unite middle peasants, meet everyone's requirements for joining the cooperative, and lead everyone on the road to socialism in future work. The meeting lasted until twelve o'clock at night. Mo Rongqi used to often doze off at meetings in the hamlet, but that night he became more and more energetic as he listened. He felt very strange: Mo Rongqi's concerns were known to Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao had answered his request to join the cooperative. That night, he couldn't fall asleep, the more he thought about it, the happier he became, his heart was warm, and he even threw off the quilt.

After the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the issue of agricultural cooperativization were issued, the staff members of Xujia Township had seen the high enthusiasm of the masses for joining the cooperative, and also clarified the class policy. The twists and turns Mo Rongqi experienced in requesting to join the cooperative was a sharp criticism of them, and also a profound education. Now Mo Rongqi and other poor and impoverished peasants who firmly requested to join the cooperative have had their requests to join the cooperative supported by the party branch, and the names of each of them have been registered. In the more than twenty cooperatives that the branch plans to establish this winter and next spring, they will all be good members playing a backbone role.

    莫荣启入社
    高长任
                              一
    自从湖北省麻城县许家乡几年来陆续办了十六个农业生产合作社以后，贫农莫荣启慢慢地也有了入社的念头。每当他进城去买卖东西，路过“曙光”、“五四”等农业合作社，亲眼看到社里生活做得整齐，庄稼长得那么好的时候，他总是想：“要是我也参加了社，把田种好了，多打了粮食，自己生活好了，又可以多卖些余粮给国家，那有多好？”
    莫荣启在生产上和生活上还是有很大困难的。他是当过二十二年长工的老农民，土地改革时分到的六亩多田，总是种不好。老夫妻俩已经五十开外，儿子不到二十岁，体力也不行；耕牛、农具又不全，怎么能种好田呢？从一九五三年起到现在，他参加了互助组，比单干要强一些，但是生活还是很困难，因此土地改革时是贫农，现在还是贫农。
    对于入社问题，他已考虑了两年，从今年春天到夏天，他入社的决心，十成已下了九成。为了慎重起见，在割稻之前，他又亲自走了一趟亲戚，到表弟刘永湖家里详细探听了社内各方面的情况。刘永湖是五四农业合作社的副社长。他热心地告诉表兄关于社内的各项政策，他也劝莫荣启入社。
    在访问过表弟之后，莫荣启便下定决心，今年一定要入社。可是，在他住的八斗丘塆子附近，还没有成立一个社。要是自己带头组织一个社吧，又没有这个能力，他就只好耐心等待。
    动镰割稻的时候，他忽然听到一个好消息说，他们邻塆甘本友互助组要转社了，他十分高兴。他的田就靠近甘本友互助组的田，而且有一块大田就在他们互助组的田中间。有一天，他在田里割稻，遇见甘本友，他满面笑容地问甘本友：“听说你们要转社，我能不能参加？”甘本友也笑着说：“社门是大开的，你想参加还能不收你。”得到甘本友的答复，他满心欢喜，临走时又叮咛说：“你们哪天开会，告诉我一声。”回家来，他就像一个社员一样，教训起儿子来了，他对儿子说：“社里是多劳多得，你能做多少尽量地做。人多心齐力量大，把田种好了，对自己好，对国家也好。”这个愉快的消息，他也没有对邻居们隐瞒，一天功夫，大家都知道莫荣启要参加农业合作社了。二
    自从甘本友答复他可以入社以后，一连几天没有讯息，莫荣启很焦急。恰好县委工作组宋同志到他们这个选区来工作了。他就向宋同志提出入社的要求，宋同志顺口说道：“可以。”莫荣启要求宋同志帮他写个入社申请书送给甘本友，他想这样做牢靠一些。宋同志说：“说一下就行了，不用写申请书。”
    可是，宋同志答应了以后，入社的事情仍然没有一点动静。莫荣启又连找甘本友两次。第一次找甘本友，甘本友正同宋同志谈话，甘本友顺口答复他：“明天晚上到你家来谈。”第二天，他叫儿子拿两个鸡蛋到小贩那里换了七根纸烟，等着甘本友。从傍晚等到天黑，天黑等到深夜，还不见甘本友的影子。第三天他心里耐不住，不管自己当时正在发疟子，就拄着一个锄头又去找甘本友。甘本友正在田里种荞麦。莫荣启仍然和气地问：“我入社的事怎么办呀？”甘本友非常为难，他上次曾经把莫荣启要求入社的事情同组员们谈过，有两户中农不同意。正在准备转社的时候，他也不敢做主，就只好应付莫荣启说：“你的田虽然近，但是住得远些，以后吃饭、走路要耽误功夫，开会也不方便。”莫荣启说：“误工就扣我的分子。就是刮风下雨，开会我也保证到。”甘本友只好把话岔开说：“有些政策我还不懂，你去问宋同志吧。”“老宋在哪里？”
    “老宋到县里开会去了，要个把月才能回来。”
    莫荣启入社心切，过了一天就进城去找宋同志。到了县里开会的地方，他逢人就打听宋同志在哪里。别人说：“姓宋的很多，你找哪一个，叫什么名字？”这一来可把他难住了。他虽然见过宋同志很多次，可是从来没有问起过他的名字。没有办法，他就在开会的大礼堂的门口等着，看见大门口来来往往倒有不少人，就是没见到宋同志。一直等到中午，没有指望了，才垂头丧气地走回来。
    他心里非常懊恼，难道真的不能参加社了么？他的邻居萧永达知道他要求入社的情形，现在看到他碰到这许多钉子，对他开玩笑地说：“甘本友说社的大门是开着的，我看现在社门又闩上了，你莫想进去了。”萧永达说的是笑话，但莫荣启却认了真，他赌气地说：“只要是共产党领导的社，我总参加得了。”
    宋同志不在；甘本友不干脆答复；别人又取笑他：莫荣启感到真没有办法。有一天，不知听谁说甘本友那个组将来要选王开焱当社长。他忽然找到另一条门路，就去找王开焱。那知王开焱也推托说：“我们社里二十户已经够了，不多要。”莫荣启着急地说：“难道多我一户就不行？我的田靠你们田那么近，有多好！”王开焱是个老实人，说不得一句假话，见莫荣启追问的紧，只好说了实话。他说原来他们组里是有人同意他入社的，但有两户中农不同意，说莫荣启这个人嘴巴不好，爱说直话；甘本友拿不定主意，事情还没有决定。这一来莫荣启才恍然大悟，他知道那两户中农所以不同意他入社，原来是在去年粮食统购的时候，他向工作同志检举过这两户中农隐瞒产量和套购粮食的事情。他想：“怪不得甘本友不答复我入社的要求，原来有人在背后说坏话。”从这时候起，他知道光找甘本友互助组的人是不行的，还得找工作同志。
    以后，他见到过本选区的党员郭万象、乡支部委员蓝彩山、支部书记周明山等七、八个乡工作人员。他见到这些工作人员，就请求帮助他入社。但每一次都没有能满足他的要求。有人叫他“耐心等一等”；有人说他入社的积极性是好的；也有人叫他再找甘本友商量……
    想到入社的困难，真叫他有些灰心，他想：“入社真比春天没吃的向人家借粮还困难，求爷爷，拜奶奶的，就差跪下磕头了。”可是一想到今年再不入社，明年生产还是不能搞好的时候，就又鼓起勇气来了。
    不久，许家乡进行粮食“三定”工作，莫荣启又碰见了宋同志，他喜出望外地请宋同志帮助他入社。可是，宋同志却冷冷地对他说：“你这样积极要求入社，是真是假，我还不知道，要在‘三定’工作中考验你。”莫荣启没有生气；他听了宋同志的话，在“三定”工作中，确实帮助工作组做了一些工作。三
    许家乡的“三定”工作已近尾声。甘本友互助组转社工作也在积极进行。农民已在等着下雨要犁田种麦了。可是，莫荣启入社的事又被大家遗忘了。
    莫荣启碰了许多钉子，也不想再求人帮忙了。他感到非常抱屈，他想：“他们为什么不要我入社呢？论成份，我一直是贫农；论历史，我打了二十二年长工。那样不够入社条件？难道就是因为我穷才不叫我入社吗？”他越想越不甘心，又在计划着最后一场斗争。他盘算着：等甘本友互助组转社转成了，自己就到乡政府去告状，问他们“为什么不要我入社”？乡政府不行到区公所，区公所不行到县政府，如果政府说一声“因为你穷不能入社”，那他才甘心。
    正当莫荣启满腔怨愤无处发泄的时候，在九月十九日的下午，他得到一个通知，要他晚上到乡政府去开会。
    汽灯把乡政府的大屋子照得雪亮，屋里坐满了人，有社内的，有社外的，但都是生活上、生产上还有困难的农民。会上，工作组长传达了中共中央关于农业合作化问题的指示。乡支部书记在会上作了检讨，检讨乡支部过去在办社中没有很好贯彻阶级政策，犯了排斥贫农的错误，他要求大家对支部提出批评。他还代表全体党员表示，在以后的工作中坚决依靠贫农，团结中农，满足大家入社的要求，领导大家走社会主义的道路。会一直开到夜晚十二点钟。莫荣启平常在塆子里开会，常常会打瞌睡的，可是这天晚上越听越有精神。他觉得真奇怪：他莫荣启的心事，被毛主席知道了，毛主席答复了他的入社要求了。这一夜，他没有能睡着觉，越想越高兴，心里热乎乎的，把被子也掀开了。
    在中共中央关于农业合作化问题的指示下达后，许家乡的工作人员已经看到了群众要求入社的高涨情绪，也明确了阶级政策。莫荣启要求入社受到的波折，是对他们一个尖锐的批评，也是一次深刻的教育。现在莫荣启和其他坚决要求入社的贫苦农民一样，他们的入社要求得到党支部的支持，他们每人的名字，已经登记起来。在支部规划的今冬明春建立的二十多个社中，他们都会是起骨干作用的好社员。
