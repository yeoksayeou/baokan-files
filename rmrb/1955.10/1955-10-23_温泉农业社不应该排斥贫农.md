    The Hot Springs Agricultural Cooperative Should Not Exclude Poor Peasants
    To the Editor:
    The Hot Springs Agricultural Cooperative in Baoxia Township, Yushe County, was established in the autumn of last year. At that time, a total of 42 households joined the cooperative, including eight households of poor peasants and new middle peasants, 32 households of middle peasants, and two households of former landlords who had changed their status. However, by the time of spring planting this year, only 32 households of middle peasants and two households of former landlords who had changed their status remained. Originally, Cheng Shuiquan (the deputy secretary of the township's Party branch), a member of the cooperative's committee, and others believed that poor peasants and new middle peasants had meager resources and little to offer, and would not produce much grain for the cooperative; therefore, without going through the county committee or informing the township branch, they quietly expelled eight households of poor peasants and new middle peasants, including Cheng Lao Qiba. This erroneous practice of excluding poor peasants is a complete violation of the Party's class line in rural areas. Cheng Lao Qiba's family has four members, and he is a martyr's family member, with only him being able to work. This spring, his eyes worsened. After being expelled from the cooperative, he had no way to produce, and in addition, the cooperative occupied the ox he and a military dependent family in the cooperative shared, refusing to let Lao Qiba use it even for one day. As a result, his production this year was poor. Lao Qiba weeps with anger whenever he mentions being squeezed out by the cooperative.
    After discovering the erroneous practices of the Hot Springs Agricultural Cooperative, we raised our concerns with Cheng Shuiquan. Not only did he not accept them, but he insisted on his mistakes. Now, our county is rectifying agricultural cooperatives. We suggest that the Yushi County Committee of the Communist Party of China conduct a rectification of the Hot Springs Agricultural Cooperative, provide the necessary education to Cheng Shuiquan, who persists in his erroneous practices, and take appropriate action.

    温泉农业社不应该排斥贫农编辑同志：
    榆社县堡下乡温泉农业社是在去年秋天成立起来的。当时入社的共四十二户，其中有贫农、新中农八户，中农三十二户，改变成分后的富农两户。但是到今年春天种地时却只剩下了三十二户中农和两户改变了成分的富农。原来这个社的社务委员成水泉（乡的党支部副书记）等，认为贫农和新中农家底薄，要啥没啥，在社里也打不下多少粮；因此他们既不通过县委，也没让乡支部知道，就悄悄把成老七保等八户贫农和新中农赶出社了。这种排斥贫农的错误做法，是完全违背党在农村的阶级路线的。贫农成老七保家有四口人，是个烈属，就他一个人能劳动，今春眼睛又坏了。他被赶出社以后，没法生产，再加上他和在社里的一家军属伙有的一条牛，社里天天占着不叫老七保用一天，因此他今年生产搞得不好。老七保一提起社里把他挤出来，就气得流泪。
    我们发现温泉农业社的错误作法以后，曾对成水泉提过意见，他不但不接受，反而坚持自己的错误。现在，我县正在整顿农业社，我们建议中共榆社县委会对温泉农业社进行一次整顿，对坚持自己错误做法的成水泉给以应有的教育，并作适当的处理。　山西省榆社县兵役局　常忠文　常文义
