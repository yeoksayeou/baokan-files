    Complete the task of trial-manufacturing new products and accelerate the technological transformation of enterprises
    Aiding, Director of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant
    From the second half of 1954 to the present, our factory has successfully trial-manufactured and formally manufactured fifteen types of Soviet-style modern grinders. We have also trial-manufactured and manufactured seven kinds of hydraulic transmission system equipment, the "heart" needed for new-style milling machines, planers, broaching machines, shapers, and sawing machines produced by brother factories. Before 1954, the cycle for trial-manufacturing a new product averaged twelve months, but now it has been shortened to seven or eight months. In the past, we could only produce one new variety per year on average, but now we can produce one in less than two months. In the past, our factory only produced two or three varieties of grinders each year, but this year, in addition to collaborative tasks, we are producing seventeen varieties simultaneously.
    In addition to the task of trial-manufacturing new products, the task of increasing production that we are undertaking is also very heavy. In June of this year, the state increased our production target by more than 60 percent over the original annual plan. In the complex situation of organizing the alternating production of new and old products and the successive production of multiple varieties, we have basically been able to complete the plan according to the requirements of the state, and have timely supplied the technical equipment needed for national industrial construction.
    Trial-manufacturing new products and increasing product varieties is an important technological policy of the state. The Party and the state have often pointed out that the machinery industry is the heart of heavy industry, and the machine tool industry is the foundation of the machinery industry, and should continuously supply other industrial production departments with advanced technical equipment. However, in the past, our understanding of this was insufficient. Before the first half of 1954, the machine tools manufactured by our factory were all old products with outdated styles, low quality, and single varieties, and even now there are still many in the warehouse that cannot be sold. The technological transformation within the enterprise was carried out very slowly. We never studied and formulated a factory variety development plan and a new product trial-manufacturing plan, and did not include the trial-manufacturing of new products in the normal production operation plan, but regarded it as an accessory. There was also a lack of organizational leadership for this work.
    The large backlog of old products and the lack of sales forced us to revise the annual production plan from the second half of 1954, reduce old products, and try to increase the production of new varieties.
    Trial-manufacturing new products is a fierce struggle between advanced and conservative ideas. First of all, it is a great difficulty to change the old technical habits that have become familiar and re-learn the advanced Soviet system. Trial-manufacturing new products will inevitably encounter new technical problems. For example, modern grinders mostly use hydraulic transmission devices, but we were used to making gear transmissions in the past. Mastering new technologies involves technical conditions such as equipment, instruments, and tools, especially the fear that the technical force is not enough and the technical level does not meet the design requirements. The leaders of the workshops dislike the low output value of new products, and are afraid of scrapping the work they have never done before. Workers are afraid of not meeting the quota. At first, we emphasized these difficulties, lacked confidence, and did not fully understand the significance of promoting the trial-manufacturing of new products, and we did not talk enough to the employees. Later, under the leadership of the higher-level organs and the local Party committee, we overcame the aforementioned incorrect understanding and practices, strengthened this work, and gradually achieved results.
    The results of trial-manufacturing and manufacturing new products have brought about tremendous changes in all aspects of the enterprise.
    First, the contradiction between production and sales was resolved, and the financial situation of the enterprise improved significantly. When we produced old products in 1953, the annual sales volume only accounted for 65 percent of the production volume. In 1954, we mainly produced new products, and the annual sales volume accounted for 80 percent of the production volume, and most of the backlog was old products. This year's sales situation has become a seller's market. In 1953, the average capital turnover period of our factory was 371 days, in 1954 it was 308 days, and this year's plan is 238 days, which greatly shortened the turnover period of funds such as production, reserves, and finished products. In 1953, we relied on bank credit to live, and paid nearly 200,000 yuan in interest for the whole year; in 1954, it was reduced to more than 21,000 yuan; this year, we have basically not relied on bank loans, and the quarterly financial plan can strive for balance and have surpluses. We expect that the funds accumulated for the state this year will increase by 20 percent compared with last year. In the past, we had never completed the financial plan, but last year and the first half of this year we were able to comprehensively complete the state's production, technology, and financial plan.
    Secondly, it accelerated the technological transformation of the enterprise and improved product quality. In 1953 and 1954, the higher authorities transferred technical personnel from universities and technical colleges who came from our factory accounted for three-fifths of the factory's technical personnel at the time, of which engineers accounted for four-fifths of all engineers, and the skilled technicians who were transferred out were approximately equal to the strength of our main processing workshop. However, the situation of trial-manufacturing new products is: one type was trial-manufactured in 1953, seven types were trial-manufactured in 1954, and nine types will be trial-manufactured this year. Under the circumstances of increased tasks and the transfer of most of the technical personnel, the reason why we were still able to successfully complete the task of trial-manufacturing new products is mainly because we improved the technical level in the trial-manufacturing work, trained and cultivated a group of technical forces, and gradually mastered the modern technology of manufacturing grinders. Last year, we also systematically carried out production technology preparation work, organized the work of the sections, and gave full play to the role of the sections. The work efficiency of the design section has increased eight times than before, ensuring a complete set of drawings for a new product every month. The work efficiency of the construction section has increased nine times, ensuring the supply of process documents and process equipment for five or six varieties to the workshop every month. After the trial-manufacturing of new products, we also had a certain technical level to improve the quality of old products. This spring, we carried out a more thorough improvement on a universal grinder that was made in 1950, changed some of the design, redrew all the drawings, re-formulated the process cards, and replaced the tooling. The workload of these tasks was very large, and in the past, production would have to be stopped to carry them out, but we managed to improve them while producing. Through the trial-manufacturing work, we also strengthened technical management, established a set of production technology preparation work systems, and enriched and expanded the technical organization. The hydraulic workshop of our factory was established to adapt to the manufacturing of new-style grinders, and now it has a history of two years. The factory's research and experimental institutions (such as metrology verification rooms, machine tool test rooms, and construction laboratories) have also begun to be organized.
    The third is the establishment of the basic order of production activities. In 1953, our factory produced very few varieties, the output was large, the tasks were fixed, and the conditions of the cadres were good, so it was possible to promote the operation plan and establish a normal order of activities, but we did not succeed in promoting it, and the production management was very chaotic. Last year, when we revised the plan, we made a unified arrangement for the work of the entire factory, carefully discussed the variety development plan for the next year or two, practically formulated the annual new product trial-manufacturing plan, adjusted the old product production plan, and uniformly formulated the "Annual Commodity Production Plan." The sections compiled the "Comprehensive Plan Table for New Product Preparation Work" according to the above plan, and carried out various specific tasks for production technology preparation; the workshop compiled the monthly production operation plan according to it, and carried out various operation preparations before production. At the same time, the sections and workshops both turned the monthly plan into a personal daily progress plan or a day and night shift operation plan. We also carefully analyzed the structural, part, and process characteristics of new products and series products, and learned that the parts removed from each product in the series can be roughly divided into seven categories according to their shape: shafts, sleeves, large parts, curved parts, standard parts, and hydraulic parts. According to the characteristics that the shape of the parts is similar and the processing methods are also roughly similar, and according to the requirements of the process regulations, we made a more thorough and unified adjustment to the factory's production technology organization, fixed the production activity process of product parts within a more suitable labor organization, in order to clarify the division of labor, familiarize ourselves with the business, be responsible to the end, ensure quality and quantity, avoid excessive entrusted work between each other, and facilitate the control of work in progress. On the other hand, from the beginning of trial-manufacturing samples, we paid attention to the work of setting quotas, especially the management of man-hour quotas, and figured out some methods for setting quotas during sample trial-manufacturing, batch trial-manufacturing, and formal production. In order to make the man-hour quotas both advanced and realistic, we improved the original record system, and according to the characteristics of the new product process route, we implemented the original record of long and short work tickets and other methods to grasp the flow of work in progress on various equipment in the workshop.
    The trial-manufacturing of new products and the organization of multi-variety production have changed the planning, technology, and economic work of the enterprise, and are ultimately reflected in the cost of the products. In the total cost of old products produced by our factory in 1953, management expenses (including enterprise management fees and workshop expenses) accounted for more than 50 percent; in the total cost of trial-manufacturing and manufacturing new products in 1954, management expenses only accounted for 41 percent, a decrease of 32 percent compared with the actual cost level in 1953; in the product cost in the first half of this year, management expenses only accounted for 37 percent, and it is expected that it will be reduced by 20 percent compared with the actual cost level last year due to the development of the production increase and economy practice campaign in the second half of the year. These facts break the misconception of some people that trial-manufacturing new products will raise the cost of the factory.
    According to our experience over the past year or so, we should pay special attention to the following issues when carrying out new product trial-manufacturing work:
    First, the new product trial-manufacturing plan must be combined with the national construction plan and must meet the needs of the current industrial construction. We cannot avoid difficulties and only proceed from how convenient it is for our enterprise. Of course, there are indeed many difficulties in the work of trial-manufacturing new products. However, as long as we fully understand the serious significance of trial-manufacturing new products, these specific difficulties can be overcome. Moreover, with the development of national economic construction, some difficulties will gradually be reduced. For example, sometimes the higher authorities issue the trial-manufacturing plan later, which causes the already weak design force to be idle (we lost a quarter of the time because of this last year); sometimes the plan is changed midway, which makes the enterprise's work passive. Now that the state's first five-year plan has been determined, there is a reliable basis for preparing the trial-manufacturing plan in the future. For example, when there are more varieties, there are new product trial-manufacturing tasks every month, and the required output of varieties varies, and the production of new and old products alternates, and the varieties are constantly rotated, the management is very complicated. However, as long as we correctly grasp the law of alternating development of new and old products, prepare for the rotation of products, attach importance to trial-manufacturing, and turn trial-manufacturing work into a normal work of the entire factory, this difficulty can also be overcome.
    Second, the work of trial-manufacturing new products and developing varieties should be combined with determining the professional direction of the enterprise and the serialization of products. In the past, we have produced many kinds of products such as boilers, drilling machines, grinders, and boring machines, which is not conducive to technical development. Later, the higher authorities determined that the professional direction of our factory was to manufacture grinders and decided to trial-manufacture Soviet grinders. However, at first, we did not pay attention to studying the series of Soviet grinders, did not find the basic styles or representative varieties in the series products, and chose the general-purpose ones with a large demand for trial-manufacturing, which hindered the development of parts standardization work to a certain extent. After the guidance of Soviet experts and our collection of information and research, we found a way to develop series products in our professional direction, and thus carried out the work of parts standardization. According to the technical conditions of our factory, we selected four series of grinders, namely plane, cylindrical, universal, and special, for trial-manufacturing and production in the professional direction of grinders. Among them, plane and cylindrical are the main series. In the parts of various products in these two series, the proportion of standard parts, general parts, and borrowed parts is very high, generally accounting for 35 to 40 percent of the types of machine tool parts. In this way, not only is it convenient for model selection and production organization, but also creates a favorable condition for accelerating new product trial-manufacturing and developing varieties.
    Third, it should be combined with the fundamental transformation of internal management of the enterprise. Trial-manufacturing new products is the starting point for the enterprise to move towards a new technical level. Only by mastering new technologies can the production appearance of the enterprise be completely changed. The primary task in trial-manufacturing new products is to strengthen the specific leadership of technical work. In order to meet the requirements of new products and new technologies, we adjusted the technical institutions and technical organizations and strengthened the technical force of key departments. Last year, we adjusted the design section, strengthened the design force, and the engineers assigned to the section accounted for 61 percent of the engineers in the factory. In order to master the process technology of hydraulic equipment, a hydraulic workshop was specially established. At the same time, we vigorously strengthened the preparation work for production technology. In addition to design work, we also paid attention to the work of the process section, so that process preparation can actively solve the problems that occur in the production process. We especially strengthened the tool workshop, making it the largest processing workshop in the factory, ensuring the timely supply of thousands of sets of tools required for multi-variety production. Another task is to strengthen the unified leadership of production and technology. In the past, our trial-manufacturing work was mainly managed by the chief engineer, and the production work was managed by another deputy director, which weakened the production technology leadership force, which proved to be a harmful method. For the needs of trial-manufacturing, we also improved the work of planning management and financial management to ensure the completion of the trial-manufacturing task.
    Fourth, striving to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and resolutely implementing the suggestions of experts will accelerate the speed of new product trial-manufacturing and quickly master new technologies. Since the second half of 1953, our trial-manufacturing work has been carried out based on Soviet technical data. The trial-manufacturing process is also the process of learning from the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union. We have received specific guidance from Soviet experts. For example, the organization and leadership of trial-manufacturing, the product variety development plan, and other issues were all resolved with the help of Soviet experts. At first, we could only translate or map from Soviet data when designing new products, and we did not know how to make design technical task books, but Soviet experts taught us the method and personally demonstrated how to carry out new product identification and standardization work in our factory. Many major key process problems in production were also solved with the help of experts. For example, the manufacture of hydraulic equipment for grinders is an experience that has been accumulated over a long period of time in the Soviet Union, and we have learned it in just two years. From our personal experience, we realize that learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and implementing the suggestions of experts is a matter of line. In terms of organizational work, we have insisted on taking learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union as a daily life system.
    Fifth, the work of trial-manufacturing new products should be turned into a major event for the entire factory, a major event in the lives of employees, and an action for the entire factory, mobilizing everyone to go all out. We have organized relevant section personnel and workshop workers to study new product data in a planned way. In addition to organizing the study of Russian (workers learn the alphabet, technical cadres learn to read books, and four training classes have been held for this purpose, learning away from production, for a month, and training in batches and in rotation), Soviet mechanical drawing methods, and Soviet standard tolerance systems, etc., when trial-manufacturing each new variety, if it is a mapping sample, we organize visits, and explain the structural, performance, function and other design characteristics of this machine tool and the process methods of important parts in the form of lectures, so as to prepare for trial-manufacturing. At the same time, we include the trial-manufacturing work in the section plan, and the factory functional institutions include the sample manufacturing work in the workshop production operation plan, requiring them to be familiar with the processing requirements, so that the trial-manufacturing is not separated from the production. In the trial-manufacturing process, we especially attach importance to the rationalization proposals of employees, summarize and promote advanced experience, and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of employees. We stipulate that the original Soviet design is not allowed to be changed or altered at will, but in terms of process methods, in order to adapt to the current technical conditions in the factory, and on the premise of not violating quality requirements, we encourage employees to put forward rationalization proposals to solve the problems in construction. For example, in order to accelerate the trial-manufacturing work, high-speed cutting has been promoted on more than 80 percent of the lathes in the factory, increasing the feed rate from 70 meters per minute to 200 meters. 80 percent of the planers have adopted the advanced Soviet "wonderful planer" method, which doubles the efficiency. The surface strengthening method of cutting tools is universally adopted in the factory, which not only improves efficiency, but also saves tools. When processing hydraulic equipment, because we do not have special machine tools, the work efficiency is low and the quality is poor. It takes 211 hours to manufacture a hydraulic equipment, and it takes half a month for assembly and test run. Later, after the workers' initiative, the operation method was improved, and now it only takes 132 hours, and assembly and test run only take 31 hours. For example, the operation box, one of the main parts of hydraulic equipment, has not been able to achieve interchangeability in hole and shaft processing. Last year, the third quarter did not reach the fourth-level tolerance; this year, the first quarter reached the second-level tolerance, and the second quarter reached the first-level tolerance, but it was still a single match and could not be interchanged; after the workers improved the grinding method, the hole and shaft cooperation in August reached interchangeability, and 80 percent of the parts can be interchanged. From last year to July of this year, 308 employees put forward 381 rationalization proposals, which accelerated the trial-manufacturing process and solved many construction problems that occurred in the trial-manufacturing process. In addition, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of employees in trial-manufacturing new products, an incentive policy should be implemented. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this point, lacked praise for employees who have contributed to the trial-manufacturing work, and even less material rewards, which made some employees not care about the trial-manufacturing work, weakened their enthusiasm, and affected their work mood. Now we have formulated a new product reward system to improve this shortcoming.
    Sixth, the technical standards for new products are very strict. In order to ensure quality, we must adhere to the new product trial-manufacturing procedures. In this regard, our factory has had painful lessons in the past. The normal trial-manufacturing process is divided into three steps: product design, sample trial-manufacturing, and small-batch trial-manufacturing. However, several varieties that our factory had successfully trial-manufactured in the past were designed while trial-manufacturing, disrupting the steps, and the results were full of problems in production. After trial-manufacturing the Soviet-style new products, there has been improvement in this regard, but it has not been strictly implemented according to the instructions of the higher authorities. For example, sample identification is not valued in sample trial-manufacturing, and identification is often neglected after the small-batch trial-manufacturing is completed, so that many parts in the new product cannot be finalized in time. Therefore, we feel that in order to reduce problems in the formal production process, we must strictly and conscientiously do a good job in the work of each stage according to the trial-manufacturing steps, because trial-manufacturing is the preparation for formal production. If we put more effort in trial-manufacturing, we can achieve the purpose of improving quality, shortening the cycle, and facilitating management after formally putting it into production.
    Seventh, actively strengthening production cooperation between brother factories is a key issue to ensure the quality of new products and timely completion of the trial-manufacturing progress. Many parts of our factory's new products need to be manufactured by other factories, generally accounting for 15 to 36 percent of the types of parts in the product, such as all electrical equipment, grinder tools—grinding wheels, and rolling bearings that ensure the accuracy of the grinder. Some purchased parts of each new product are new varieties of the manufacturing factory, and they also need to be designed and trial-manufactured, just like the boring rods and hydraulic equipment that our factory manufactures for brother factories are new products that our factory has never made before. There are many technical problems. If it is not managed properly, it will cause the cooperation to be overdue, affect each other, and fail to complete the task. We feel that in order to solve this problem, in addition to overcoming the local point of view with an overall point of view and establishing the idea of attaching importance to cooperation, we should also actively establish a correct relationship with the cooperative factories. For example, providing technical data as early as possible, signing cooperation contracts in a practical way, avoiding changes to the plan midway as much as possible, and strengthening close contact with each other. In the past, the reason why our factory's new products could be made on time was inseparable from the support of brother factories. In the future, we will further strengthen this connection and use the action of ensuring the completion of the orders placed by brother factories in our factory to answer them. (Attached picture)
    The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant successfully trial-manufactured the semi-automatic 345A spline grinder on October 20th. This grinder is used to grind the mandrels on automobile gears. This grinder is very precise, and the allowable tolerance of the division of the grinding workpiece does not exceed one-sixth of a hair's breadth. This is a worker test driving.

    完成试制新产品任务，加速企业的技术改造
    上海机床厂厂长　艾丁
    从一九五四年下半年到现在，我们厂一共试制成功和正式制造了十五种苏联型式的现代化磨床，还试制和制造了七种兄弟厂所生产的新式铣床、刨床、拉床、铡床、锯床等工作母机所需要的心脏——液压传动系统设备。一九五四年以前，我们试制一种新产品的周期平均要十二个月，现在已缩短到七、八个月。过去平均一年才能制出一种新品种，现在平均不到两个月便可以制出一种。过去我厂每年生产的磨床只有两三个品种，今年除协作任务之外，同时生产的达到十七个品种。
    除了新产品试制任务以外，我们所担负的增加产量的任务也是很繁重的。今年六月，国家给我们的增产任务，比原定的全年计划提高了百分之六十以上。在组织新老产品交替生产和多品种轮番生产的复杂情况下，我们基本上能够按照国家的要求完成计划，及时供应了国家工业建设所需要的技术装备。
    试制新产品，增加产品品种，这是国家的一项重要的技术政策。党和国家经常指出：机械工业是重工业的心脏，机床工业又是机械工业的基础，应该不断地以先进的技术设备供应其他工业生产部门。但是，过去我们对这一点认识不足，一九五四年上半年以前，我厂制造的机床全是型式陈旧、质量不高、品种单一的老产品，直到现在还有很多积压在仓库里卖不出去。企业内部的技术改造进行得很迟缓，从来没有研究拟制过工厂品种发展计划和新产品试制计划，没有把试制新产品排入正常的生产作业计划之内，而把它看作是附属品。对这件工作也缺少组织领导。
    老产品大量积压、没有销路。这种情况迫使我们从一九五四年下半年起，不得不修改了年度生产计划，削减了老产品，设法增加新品种生产。
    试制新产品，这是一场先进思想同保守思想的剧烈斗争。首先，要把已经熟悉了的陈旧的技术习惯改掉，重新学习苏联先进的一套，这就是一个很大的困难。试制新产品，必然要遇到新的技术问题，例如现代化磨床多是液压传动装置，而我们过去却做惯了齿轮传动的。掌握新的技术，要涉及技术条件，如设备、仪器、工具等，特别是怕技术力量不够，技术水平达不到设计的要求。车间的领导人员嫌新产品产值低，没有做过的活怕做废。工人则怕达不到定额。起初，我们强调了这些困难，信心不足，对提倡试制新产品的意义认识不够，对职工们讲得更不够。后来，在上级机关和地方党委的领导下，克服了前述不正确的认识和做法，加强了这一工作，才逐步获得了成绩。
    试制和制造新产品的结果，使企业在各方面都发生了巨大的变化。
    首先，解决了产销脱节的矛盾，使企业财务情况显著好转。我们在一九五三年生产旧产品的时候，全年销售量只占生产量的百分之六十五。一九五四年主要是生产新产品，全年销售量占到生产量的百分之八十，积压的多是老产品。今年的销售情况已经变成供不应求。一九五三年我厂资金周转期平均是三百七十一天，一九五四年是三百零八天，今年计划为二百三十八天，使生产、储备、成品等资金的周转期大大缩短。一九五三年我们靠银行信贷过日子，全年付息近二十万元；一九五四年减少到两万一千多元；今年我们已经基本上不依赖银行贷款了，季度财务计划能够争取平衡，并有盈余。我们预计，今年为国家积累的资金将比去年增加百分之二十。以前我们从没有完成过财务计划，去年和今年上半年能够全面地完成了国家的生产技术财务计划。
    其次，加速了企业的技术改造，改善了产品质量。一九五三、一九五四两年上级从我厂调走的大学和专科学校出身的技术人员占当时全厂技术人员的五分之三，其中工程师级干部占全部工程师的五分之四，调出的熟练的技术工人约等于现在我们一个主要加工车间的力量。而试制新产品的情况却是：一九五三年试制了一种，一九五四年试制了七种，今年要试制九种。在任务增大、技术人员抽调了大半的情况下，我们所以还能够顺利地完成试制新产品的任务，主要是由于在试制工作中提高了技术水平，训练培养了一批技术力量，逐渐掌握了制造磨床的现代工艺技术。去年，我们还有计划地进行了生产技术准备工作，把科室工作组织了起来，充分发挥了科室工作的作用。设计科的工作效率比以前提高八倍，保证了每个月出一种新产品的全套图纸。施工科工作效率增长了九倍，保证了每月供应车间五、六个品种的工艺文件和工艺装备。经过新产品的试制，也使得我们有了一定的技术水平，来改进老产品的质量。今年春天，我们把在一九五○年制成的一种万能磨床进行了一次较彻底的改进，更改了一部分设计，重新全部绘制了图纸，重新制定了工艺卡片，改换了工夹具。这些工作量是很大的，在过去是要停止生产来进行的，但是我们做到了一边生产一边改进。经过试制工作，也加强了技术管理，建立了一套生产技术准备工作的制度，充实和扩大了技术组织。我厂的液压车间便是为了适应制造新式磨床成立起来的，现在已经有了两年的历史。工厂的研究、试验室机构（如计量检定室、机床试验室、施工实验室等）也开始组织起来了。
    再次是建立了生产活动的基本秩序。一九五三年，我厂生产的品种很少，产量较大，任务固定，干部条件又好，本可以推行作业计划，建立正常的活动秩序，但是我们没有推行成功，生产管理很混乱。去年我们修改计划的时候，对整个厂的工作做了一次统一的安排，认真仔细地讨论了目前一两年内的品种发展计划，切实地制定了年度的新产品试制计划，调整了老产品生产计划，统一制定了“年度商品出产计划”。各科室根据上述的计划编制了“新产品准备工作综合计划表”，进行生产技术准备的各项具体工作；车间根据它编制了月度生产作业计划，进行生产前的各项作业准备。同时，科室和车间都把月的计划变成个人每日进度计划或昼夜班作业计划。我们还比较仔细地分析了新产品和系列产品的结构、零件和工艺上的特点，了解到系列产品内各产品拆下来的零件，按其形状大致可分为轴、套、大件、曲线件、标准件及液压件等七类。根据零件形状相似、加工方法也大致相近的特点，根据工艺规程的要求，把全厂生产技术组织作了一次比较彻底的、统一的调整，把产品零件的生产活动过程固定在比较适应的劳动组织范围内，以便明确分工，熟悉业务，负责到底，保质保量，避免了相互间过多的委托工作，便于对在制品进行控制。再一方面，从开始试制样品起，我们就注意了定额工作，尤其是工时定额的管理，摸出了样品试制、成批试制以及正式生产的时候制定定额的一些办法。为了使工时定额既先进又切合实际，我们改进了原始记录制度，根据新产品工艺路线特点，实行了长短工票的原始记录以及其他各种方法，将在制品在车间各个设备上的流动情况掌握起来了。
    试制新产品和组织多品种生产，使企业的计划、技术、经济工作都有了变化，最终表现在产品的成本上。我厂一九五三年生产老产品的全部成本中，管理费用（包括企业管理费和车间经费）占百分之五十以上；一九五四年试制和制造新产品的全部成本中，管理费只占百分之四十一，比一九五三年成本实际水平降低百分之三十二；今年上半年产品成本中，管理费用只占百分之三十七，下半年由于开展了增产节约运动，预计将比去年成本实际水平降低百分之二十。这些事实打破了某些人认为试制新产品要抬高工厂成本的错误观念。
    根据我们一年多来的体会，进行新产品试制工作，要特别注意下面几个问题：
    第一，新产品试制计划必须同国家建设计划结合，必须满足当前工业建设的需要。不能避难就易，只从本企业如何方便出发。当然，试制新产品的工作困难确实很多。但是，只要充分认识了试制新产品的严重意义，这些具体困难都是可以克服的。而且，随着国家经济建设的发展，有些困难还会逐步减轻。例如，有时上级颁发试制计划较迟，致使本来就薄弱的设计力量窝工（去年我们曾因此损失了一个季度的时间）；有时又中途改变计划，使企业的工作被动。现在国家的第一个五年计划确定了，今后编制试制计划就有了可靠的依据。又如，品种多了，新产品试制任务每月有，需要的品种产量有多有少，新旧交替生产，品种不断轮番，管理是很复杂的。但是，只要正确掌握新老产品交替发展规律，做好轮番产品的准备，重视试制，把试制工作变成全厂正常的工作，这个困难也是能够克服的。
    第二，要把试制新产品、发展品种的工作同确定企业的专业方向和产品系列化工作结合起来。过去我们曾经生产过锅炉、钻探机、磨床和镗床等许多种产品，这对于技术的发展是不利的。后来，上级确定了我厂的专业方向是制造磨床，决定要试制苏联磨床。但是，我们起先没有注意研究苏联磨床的系列，没有找到系列产品内基本的型式或代表性的品种，选择通用性的、需要量较大的进行试制，结果使零部件标准化工作的开展受到一定阻碍。经过苏联专家指导和我们搜集资料研究，找到了在自己专业方向内发展系列产品的路，从而开展了零部件标准化工作。根据我们厂的技术条件，在磨床专业方向内，选择了平面、外圆、万能及专用等四个系列的磨床进行试制和生产。其中以平面、外圆为主要系列。在这两个系列内的各种产品的零部件中，标准件、通用件、借用件的比例都很高，一般都占到机床零件种类的百分之三十五至四十。这样，不但便利了选型和生产组织工作，也给加速新产品试制和发展品种创造了一个有利的条件。
    第三，要同企业内部管理的根本改造工作相结合。试制新产品是企业向新的技术水平迈进的起点，只有掌握了新的技术才能彻底改变企业的生产面貌。试制新产品时首要的工作是要加强对技术工作的具体领导。为了适应新产品新技术的要求，我们调整了技术机构和技术组织，充实重点部门的技术力量。去年，我们调整了设计科，充实了设计力量，配备到该科的工程师级干部就占全厂工程师的百分之六十一。为了掌握液压设备的工艺技术，专门成立了一个液压车间。同时大力加强生产技术准备工作，除设计工作外，我们还注意工艺科的工作，使工艺准备能较主动地解决生产过程中发生的问题。特别加强了工具车间，使它成为全厂最大的一个加工车间，保证多品种生产所需要的几千套工具的及时供应。再一个工作是加强生产和技术的统一领导。以前我们的试制工作主要由总工程师管，生产工作由另一位副厂长管，结果削弱了生产技术领导力量，证明这是有害的方法。为了试制的需要，我们还改进了计划管理和财务管理的工作，以保证完成试制任务。
    第四，努力学习苏联先进经验、坚决贯彻执行专家建议，将会加快新产品试制的速度，迅速掌握新的技术。从一九五三年下半年起，我们的试制工作都是根据苏联技术资料进行的。试制过程也就是我们学习苏联先进技术经验的过程。我们曾得到苏联专家具体的指导。例如，试制的组织领导问题、产品品种发展方案等问题，都是在苏联专家帮助下解决的。起初我们设计新产品只能照苏联资料译制或实样测绘，不会做设计技术任务书，而苏联专家教给了我们办法，并且还亲自在我厂做了如何进行新产品鉴定和标准化工作的示范。在生产中许多重大关键工艺问题，也是在专家帮助下解决的。如制造磨床液压设备，这在苏联是经过长时期努力积累起来的经验，我们在短短两年中学到了。从我们切身的体验中，认识到学习苏联先进经验、贯彻执行专家建议是一个路线问题。在组织工作上，我们把学习苏联先进经验当成一种日常的生活制度坚持下来。
    第五，要把试制新产品的工作变成全厂的重大事情，变成职工生活中的重大事情，变成全厂的行动，发动大家全力以赴。我们曾经组织有关科室人员和车间工人有计划地学习新产品资料，除组织学俄文（工人学会字母，技术干部学会看书，曾为此举办了四期训练班，脱离生产学习，一月为期，分批轮流训练）、苏联机械图识图方法、苏联标准公差制度等基本知识外，在试制每个新品种的时候，如系测绘实样，则组织参观，并且以上课方式讲解这种机床的结构、性能、功用等设计上的特点及重要零部件的工艺方法，以便做试制的准备。同时，把试制工作列入科室计划内，通过厂部职能机构把样品制造工作列入车间生产作业计划内，要他们熟悉加工要求，不使试制同生产分开。在试制过程中，特别重视职工的合理化建议，总结和推广先进经验，发挥职工的积极性和创造性。我们规定对苏联原设计不许随意更改和变动，但在工艺方法上，为适应当前厂内的技术条件，在不违反质量要求的前提下，提倡职工提合理化建议以解决施工中的问题。例如，为了加速试制工作，在全厂百分之八十以上的车床上推行高速切削，从原来一分钟进尺七十公尺增加到二百公尺。有百分之八十的刨床采用了苏联先进的“奇妙刨刀”法，提高效率二倍。全厂普遍地采用了刀具表面强化法，既提高效率，又节约工具。在加工液压设备的时候，因为我们没有专门机床，工作效率低、质量差，制造一台液压设备要二百十一小时，装配和试车还需半个月。后经工人创议，改进了操作法，现在只要一百三十二小时，装配试车只要三十一小时。又如，液压设备主要零件之一操纵箱，孔轴加工一直达不到互换性，去年第三季达不到四级公差；今年第一季达到二级公差，第二季达到了一级公差，仍是单配，不能互换；经过工人改进研磨方法后，八月份孔轴配合达到互换性，有百分之八十的零件可以互换了。从去年到今年七月份有三百零八个职工提出了三百八十一件合理化建议，加速了试制过程，解决了不少在试制过程中发生的施工问题。此外，为了鼓励职工试制新产品的积极性，应实行奖励政策。这点，过去我们注意得很不够，对试制工作有功绩的职工缺少表扬，更少物质奖励，致使一部分职工对试制工作不在乎，减弱了他们的热情，影响了工作情绪。现在我们已制定了新产品奖励制度来改进这个缺点。
    第六，新产品技术标准要求很严，为保证质量，必须坚持按新产品试制程序工作。在这方面，我厂过去有过沉痛的教训。正常试制过程分产品设计、样品试制、小批试制三步。但是我厂曾经试制好的几个品种都是一边设计，一边试制，打乱了步骤，结果在生产中毛病百出。试制苏联型新产品后，在这方面有了改进，但是还没有根据上级指示严格贯彻执行。例如在试制样品中不重视样品鉴定，小批试制完了也往往忽视鉴定，因而使新产品中许多部件不能及时定型。因此，我们感到要使正式生产过程中问题减少，必须严格认真地按试制步骤，做好各阶段工作，因为试制就是正式生产的准备，在试制中多下工夫，正式投入生产后就可达到改善质量，缩短周期，便利管理的目的。
    第七，主动加强兄弟厂之间的生产协作，这是保证新产品质量和及时完成试制进度的一个关键问题。我厂新产品中有许多零件需要其他工厂承制，一般占到产品中零件种类的百分之十五至三十六，如全部电气设备、磨床的刀具——砂轮以及保证磨床精度的滚动轴承等。每一种新产品都有一些外购件是承制厂的新品种，他们也要设计和试制，正如我厂承制兄弟厂的搪杆、液压设备等都是我厂没有做过的新产品一样，技术问题很多，如果管理不当，就会使协作脱期，相互影响，不能完成任务。我们感到，要解决这一问题，除了必须以全局观点克服局部观点，树立重视协作的思想外，还应该主动地同协作厂取得正确的关系。如尽早地提供技术资料，切实签订协作合同，尽量避免中途变动计划，加强互相间的密切联系。过去我厂新产品所以能按时制成，是同兄弟厂对我们的支援分不开的，今后我们将进一步加强这种联系，并且用保证完成兄弟工厂在我厂的订货的行动来回答他们。（附图片）
