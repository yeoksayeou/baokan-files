    Mancheng County, Hebei Province, received enthusiastic support from the masses when it carried out the "Three Fixes" policy for grain to the household, because it earnestly publicized the policy. Tian Yukong, a surplus grain farmer in Baoyang Village, said to the masses: "The 'Three Fixes' policy is really good. After the three retentions and one deduction, the remainder is considered surplus grain, and the excess production belongs to oneself. The more grain you produce, the more you benefit." Zhang Zhenhai, a grain-deficient farmer in Sujiazhuang, said: "The government's implementation of the 'Three Fixes' policy guarantees grain for grain-deficient households. I will work hard and strive to be self-sufficient next year." After the broad masses clearly understood the policy that "fixed production and fixed purchase" would remain unchanged for three years, and that increased production would not lead to increased purchases, their enthusiasm for increasing production was even higher, and they actively strengthened the later-stage management of grain crops. Han Qi, a farmer in Dabiantuo of the Second District, sent three laborers and a cart to a village more than ten miles away to collect grass and press it into fertilizer in preparation for planting wheat, and has already pressed more than fifty carts of fertilizer. According to statistics from the Second District alone, from August 25th to September 5th, artificial pollination of corn was carried out on more than 1,400 mu, and fertilizer was applied to more than 3,500 mu of yams. The members of the Jiu Yi Agricultural Cooperative in Xinzhangtun are rushing to transport more than 70 carts of manure to the fields. All seventeen agricultural cooperatives in the township have purchased more than 47,000 jin of cake fertilizer, laying a solid foundation for a bumper wheat harvest next year. Farmers throughout the county are generally increasing pig breeding and livestock raising, laying the foundation for long-term increased production. According to statistics from Xiantai and other seven townships alone, they plan to increase pig breeding by 1,490 heads and purchase more than 60 head of livestock. (Ding Gan)

    满城县贯彻粮食政策推动生产
    河北省满城县在进行粮食“三定”到户工作时，由于认真地宣传了政策，受到群众热烈拥护。抱阳村余粮户田玉空向群众说：“三定政策真好，三留一扣剩下的算余粮，超产部分归自己，增产粮食越多越沾光。”苏家庄缺粮户张振海说：“政府实行三定政策，使缺粮人家有了保障，我使把劲，明年争取自给自足。”广大群众明确了“定产、定购”三年不变，增产不增购的政策后，增产情绪更高，积极加强对粮食作物的后期管理。二区大边坨农民韩启每天三个劳力赶了大车到十里以外的村子去打草压肥，准备种麦，现已压肥五十多车。仅据二区八月二十五日至九月五日十天的统计共进行玉米人工授粉一千四百多亩，山药灌肥三千五百多亩。辛章屯九一农业社社员们抓紧往地里运粪七十多车，全乡十七个农业社已买下四万七千多斤饼肥，给明年小麦丰产打下有力基础。全县农民普遍增猪添畜，打下长期增产基础，仅据贤台等七个乡的统计计划增猪一千四百九十口，买牲口六十多头。　（丁干）
