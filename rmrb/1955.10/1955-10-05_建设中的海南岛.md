Hainan Island—this second largest island in our country, standing in the south of the motherland and covering an area of more than 34,000 square kilometers, has always been called the "Treasure Island of the Motherland." Located in the tropics, with abundant rainfall, it can be cultivated all year round, and in some areas rice can be harvested three times a year. The island has various high-quality mineral resources, large tracts of virgin forest, and fertile wasteland. The vast ocean around it contains inexhaustible fishing and salt resources.

According to preliminary surveys, there are approximately 10 million mu of wasteland on the island. Most of this wasteland is suitable for planting dozens of highly valuable tropical and subtropical cash crops unique to Hainan Island that are needed for national industrialization. These include sisal hemp, citronella, coconut, oil palm, quinine, pepper, Sea Island cotton, coffee, pineapple, and other plants. In the past few years, the state has conducted preliminary surveys of the wasteland on the island and has begun planned reclamation and planting of various cash crops. Currently, the hundreds of thousands of mu of tropical cash crops planted by state-owned farms are growing well, and some have already been harvested in large quantities.

Despite the advantageous natural conditions for developing agricultural production here, before liberation, the average yield per mu of rice was only about 150 jin on the island's more than 5 million mu of cultivated land, and it was necessary to import three months' worth of grain from Southeast Asia and other places every year. After liberation, the local Party and government decided to focus on restoring and developing agricultural production as the key to the construction of Hainan Island. After the completion of land reform throughout the island at the end of 1953, an agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation was vigorously launched in various places. By the beginning of September this year, more than 1,300 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 30,000 mutual aid teams had been established throughout the island, and the organized households of all ethnic groups accounted for about 67 percent of the total number of households on the island. In the agricultural production increase movement, the local Party and government also led farmers of all ethnic groups to improve farming techniques, reclaim wasteland, and vigorously build farmland water conservancy projects. The state also issued large amounts of agricultural loans every year to support the production of farmers of all ethnic groups. In the past four years, more than 110,000 farmland water conservancy projects of various types have been built throughout the island, benefiting a total area of more than 1.9 million mu, and 320,000 mu of land that previously yielded one crop per year has been converted to land that yields two crops per year. In 1954, the cultivated area throughout the island increased by 530,000 mu compared with 1952, and the grain output in that year increased by 28.5 percent compared with 1939, which was a year of relatively high grain output before liberation.

Hainan Island's fishing and salt production are also developing year by year. At present, coastal fishermen have organized 32 fishery production cooperatives and more than 400 fishery production mutual aid teams. The number of fishermen's households joining the cooperatives and mutual aid teams accounts for 54 percent of the total number of fishermen's households on the island. The fish output in the first half of this year reached more than 590,000 dan, equivalent to the total output for the entire year of 1950. This summer, the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Aquaculture Company also established a local state-owned seaweed breeding farm spanning more than 60 li along the coast of Qiongshan and Wenchang counties, which can produce more than 15,000 dan of fresh Gracilaria, a raw material for light industry, every year. Salt production along the coast has also far exceeded the highest level in history.

Industrial production on the island is also gradually expanding. The local state-owned Longtang Sugar Factory, which is under construction, will be put into production in November this year. The entire production process will be operated by machines, and it can produce dozens of tons of white sugar every day. Since liberation, Hainan Island has newly built, restored, and expanded more than 40 state-owned and local state-owned factories, including machinery factories, farm implement factories, ice-making factories, power plants, oil presses, brick and tile factories, etc. After the completion and opening of a main highway on the island last winter, the transportation conditions on the island have been greatly improved, promoting the prosperity of the local economy.

The cultural construction of Hainan Island has also developed accordingly. At present, there are a total of 44 middle schools and more than 2,800 primary schools on the island, with more than 335,000 middle and primary school students, an increase of nearly 100% compared with before liberation. Wenchang County, which has a more developed culture, has nine secondary schools and more than 400 primary schools. On average, one in ten people in the county is a student. In addition, each county has established hospitals and health centers. Diseases such as plague, smallpox, and cholera, which were prevalent on the island before liberation, have now been eradicated.

    建设中的海南岛
    冯子平
    海南岛——这个屹立在祖国南方、面积三万四千多平方公里的我国第二大岛，一向被称为“祖国的宝岛”。这里地处热带，雨量充沛，一年四季都能耕作，有些地区的水稻还可一年三熟。岛上有各种质量优良的矿产，有大片的原始森林，有肥沃的荒地，它周围浩瀚的海洋里有取之不尽的渔盐财富。
    据初步调查，岛上约有一千万亩左右的荒地。这些荒地大部分都适宜栽种海南岛特有的、国家工业化所需要的几十种价值很高的热带和亚热带经济作物。这就是剑麻、香茅、椰子、油棕、奎宁、胡椒、海岛棉、咖啡、菠萝等植物。几年来，国家初步勘察了岛上的荒地和开始了有计划的开荒和栽种各种经济作物。目前，国营农场种下的几十万亩热带经济作物，生长很好，有的已大量收获了。
    尽管这里具有发展农业生产的优越的自然条件，但在解放前，全岛五百多万亩耕种面积中，每亩水稻单位面积产量平均只有一百五十斤左右，每年还需要从南洋等地输入三个月的粮食。解放后，当地党和政府决定以恢复和发展农业生产作为海南岛建设的重点。一九五三年底全岛完成土地制度的改革以后，一个以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动就在各地蓬勃展开。到今年九月初，全岛已经建立了一千三百多个农业生产合作社和三万多个互助组，组织起来的各族农户约占全岛总农户百分之六十七。在农业增产运动中，当地党和政府还领导各族农民改进耕作技术，开垦荒地和大力兴修农田水利，国家每年又发放大批农业贷款扶助各族农民生产。在过去四年中，全岛兴修了各种农田水利十一万多宗，共计受益面积一百九十多万亩，还将其中的三十二万亩年收一次的田改为年收两次的田。一九五四年，全岛耕地面积比一九五二年扩大了五十三万亩，这一年的粮食产量比解放前粮食产量较高的一九三九年增长了百分之二十八点五。
    海南岛的渔业和盐业生产也在逐年发展着。目前，沿海渔民已经组织了三十二个渔业生产合作社，四百多个渔业生产互助组，入社、入组渔民户占全岛渔民户百分之五十四，今年上半年鱼产量达五十九万多担，相当于一九五零年全年的产量。今年夏天，广东省水产养殖公司还在琼东、文昌两县沿海建立了一个纵横六十多里的地方国营海藻繁殖场，每年能够生产轻工业原料石花菜一万五千多担鲜品。沿海的盐业生产也远远超过了历史上的最高水平。
    岛上的工业生产也逐渐扩大。正在兴建中的地方国营龙塘糖厂，今年十一月投入生产后，全部生产过程都由机器操作，每天可以生产白糖几十吨。解放以来，海南岛已经新建、恢复和扩建了四十多个国营和地方国营工厂，有机械厂、农具厂、制冰厂、发电厂、榨油厂、砖瓦厂等。去年冬天，岛上一条主干公路修成通车后，已大大地改善了岛上的交通状况，促进了当地经济的繁荣。
    海南岛的文化建设也有相应的发展。现在全岛共有四十四所中学和二千八百多所小学，有中、小学生三十三万五千多人，学生人数比解放前增加近一倍。文化较发展的文昌县，就有九所中等学校和四百多所小学，全县平均每十个人中就有一个学生。此外，各县都设立了卫生院和卫生所。解放前岛上流行的鼠疫、天花、霍乱等疾病，现在已经绝迹了。
