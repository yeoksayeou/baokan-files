    Successful Trial Production of Internal Pressure Water Pipe

    To the Editor:
    Our Zhongnan Cement Pipe Factory has successfully trial-produced internal pressure water pipes and is now systematically putting them into production. Large-scale production of internal pressure water pipes will save the country a great deal of steel and greatly reduce the cost of water pipes.
    Soviet experts had long suggested that we manufacture internal pressure water pipes. In June and July of this year, basic construction units in Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangxi, Hunan, Henan, Wuhan, and other places also wrote to us with such requests. All the workers and staff of our factory realized the significant importance of the trial production of internal pressure water pipes for national construction work and were determined to successfully trial-produce internal pressure water pipes in the comprehensive conservation campaign. We constantly overcame numerous difficulties and studied the technology, finally discovering that the main reasons for the previous failures were insufficient cement in the mixture, inconsistent operating techniques, slow machine speed, and adding cement after the car started rotating, resulting in pipes that were not compact, uneven, and had poor strength. We increased the speed of the centrifugal machine to about 500 revolutions per minute, added cement before the car started rotating, and increased the amount of cement by 50%. The engineer personally participated in the workshop group's pre-shift meetings and worked according to the new regulations. Our hard work yielded results, and this new product was successfully trial-produced on September 20. After repeated tests, the new product did not leak at an internal pressure of 60 pounds and did not burst at 100 pounds, fully meeting general requirements. Currently, this new product has been officially put into production, ready to be supplied in large quantities to meet the needs of basic construction in various places.
    Manufacturing internal pressure water pipes can save 94% of the steel compared to manufacturing steel pipes; the price is also reduced by about 60%; and cement pipes do not rust or corrode, and their lifespan is longer than that of steel pipes. All the workers and staff of our factory are very happy about the successful trial production of internal pressure water pipes and are determined to continue our efforts and create greater achievements in production.

    试制内压力自来水管成功编辑同志：
    我们中南水泥制管厂试制的内压力自来水管已经成功，现在正有计划地投入生产。大量生产内压力自来水管以后，将为国家节约大量钢铁，并且使水管成本大大降低。
    苏联专家早就建议我们制造内压力自来水管；今年六、七月间，上海、南京、广西、湖南、河南、武汉等地的基本建设单位也纷纷来信提出这样的要求。我们全厂职工都认识到试制内压力自来水管对于国家建设工作的重大意义，决心要在全面节约运动中把内压力自来水管试制成功。我们不断克服了重重困难，研究技术，终于发现以前没有试制成功主要是由于配料中水泥少，操作技术不一致、机器速度慢以及在车转动后才装水泥等原因；以致制成的水管不紧密，不均匀，强度差。我们就把离心机器速度加快到每分钟五百转左右，在车没有转动前先装水泥，并增加了百分之五十的水泥。工程师亲自参加了车间小组班前会，按新的规程进行工作。我们的辛勤劳动，获得了结果，在九月二十日这种新产品试制成功了。新产品经过反复试验，内压力到六十磅不渗水，到一百磅不爆破，完全合乎一般要求。目前这种新产品已正式投入生产，准备大量供应各地基本建设的需要。
    制造内压力自来水管，比制造钢铁管能节约百分之九十四的钢铁；价钱也降低了百分之六十左右；而且水泥管不锈不腐，寿命比钢铁管还要长。我们全厂职工对内压力自来水管试制成功这件事感到非常高兴，决心继续努力，在生产中创造更大的成绩。
