Revolutionary disabled veteran Comrade Li Laicai, who lost his legs on the Korean battlefield, has not been at the State-run Bo'ai Farm in Henan Province for very long. However, his abundant energy and resolute will have already been widely praised throughout the farm. He is already an outstanding tractor driver.

Comrade Li Laicai joined the army in 1948. During the Liberation War, he was awarded a Second Class Merit and was named a model party member of the entire brigade. The squad he led was also a model squad of the entire brigade. In 1950, American imperialism extended the flames of war from Korea to the borders of our motherland. Li Laicai joined the Chinese People's Volunteers to resist America and aid Korea. On one occasion, he led a squad in a fierce battle against the enemy on a snow-covered mountain three feet thick. On the position, he swore to the Party: "I will stay with the position, and will never allow the enemy to cross the mountain!" He repelled seven enemy assaults in a row, holding the position for more than four hours, until reinforcements arrived and defeated the enemy. When he finally completed his mission, his feet were frostbitten and, in desperation, he had to have both legs amputated from below the knees.

What made him feel regretful was that he could no longer go to the front lines to eliminate the American-Li bandits, and how would he live after losing his legs? Would he have to be taken care of by the Party and the people for the rest of his life? He was troubled by these questions every day.

Once, the political instructor told him, "The Soviet Union has a legless flying general who can still fly a plane after losing his legs. As long as you have education, technology, and a well-trained body, you can still participate in the construction of the motherland." After hearing this, he was so excited that he couldn't sleep that night. He thought, "If a legless flying general can fly a plane, I want to learn to drive a tractor!" From then on, he wholeheartedly devoted himself to restoring his health. In less than half a year, his health had basically improved. After being fitted with artificial legs, he practiced walking with crutches. He didn't waste a single moment, and didn't want to rest even when his legs were chafed. In a few days, he practiced walking without crutches. At first, he swayed from side to side, and his hands and legs were weak. He fell down and got up, fell down again and got up again, and finally learned to walk without crutches.

From then on, his range of activities expanded. He learned to play table tennis, volleyball, swing on the horizontal bar, fetch water, and hoe the vegetable garden. He learned to ride a bicycle after falling countless times. He took care of his own meals and laundry. When he went abroad in 1950, he weighed 130 pounds, but after being injured, he dropped to 80 pounds. Now he had increased to 138 pounds.

Due to his merits established on the battlefield, he was awarded the title of First Class Meritorious Person and a medal awarded by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. After leaving Korea, he came to the Henan Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School with honor. As the political instructor had told him when he was first injured, there were two tasks before him—to study culture and technology. A miserable childhood had made it impossible for him to attend school. Although he had learned a little culture later, he had almost forgotten it all. He was determined to start from scratch. At that time, the leaders, in order to take care of his health, only allowed him to study for two hours a day. He asked to study for five hours, but the leaders did not approve. If he secretly studied on his own, the doctor would not agree either. But Comrade Li Laicai's mind was always thinking about how to write and use the characters he was learning during his rest time. He studied culture with a thirst for knowledge, three years as one day, never interrupted, and his exam scores in every subject were above 90 points. In 1953, after passing the test, he was transferred from the senior elementary class to the junior high class.

In 1954, the school leaders decided that he and three other comrades should try to learn to drive cars and tractors. How excited he was! He submitted a guarantee to the Party, determined to learn well and never retreat. At this time, a series of hopes appeared in his mind: to become an excellent tractor driver, to cultivate the land for the peasants, so that they could be freed from heavy labor forever.

There were no tractors at the school, so they first learned to drive cars. He understood that it was not enough to have the bravery on the battlefield and the perseverance in the hospital. He had to study technology diligently. In just four months, he completely understood the basic principles of the structure of cars and tractors, the operating methods, and how to troubleshoot problems.

In June, he began his driving internship. The first and biggest difficulty he encountered was that he could not control the speed and amount of fuel with his artificial leg when stepping on the accelerator and clutch. The car did not obey his commands, and he tried for several days without success. He and another comrade jointly studied this problem, and did hypothetical experiments with tables and chairs during rest. After three or four days of hard thinking and experimentation, he found the reason: people with real feet can use their toes to freely operate the accelerator, but he could not aim accurately when he only pressed his artificial leg down with his knee. He thought of a solution: use the strength of his thigh to push his knee, and his knee to push his artificial foot; when his thigh exerted force, he slightly lifted it up, so that his thigh and artificial foot basically formed a straight line. When he tried this in the car, the effect was very good. After three or four days, he quickly learned emergency deceleration gear changes and emergency stops. The technical difficulties brought about by the amputation of both limbs were basically solved. He could freely drive all kinds of cars in the schoolyard.

In May of this year, he was sent to Bo'ai Farm for an internship. May is the busiest season for summer harvesting and planting. Comrade Li Laicai was assigned to be the assistant driver of Tractor No. 28, and was engaged in transporting wheat with flatbed trailers during the wheat harvest. In this farm, the wheat harvested by a combine harvester could never be transported by a single trailer. The combine harvester harvested a seed box every twenty minutes, while the trailer usually took thirty minutes to return to the threshing ground for transportation, so the harvesting and transportation were out of sync. It so happened that the tractor to which Li Laicai was assigned as an assistant was the one with the smallest horsepower and the slowest speed in the entire farm. In order to change the state of transportation lagging behind harvesting, he first discussed with his driver and decided to try to shorten the time in every link of the transportation, and reduce the time of each run to twenty minutes. He cherished the machine as much as he cherished his own eyes, and carefully checked the machine engine, accelerator, and circuit whenever he had a moment. In a short period of time, he created many ways to haul more and run faster. For example, running fast when empty, running steadily when loaded, unloading grain urgently, mastering the law of seed box filling, etc. These methods could save time. The emergency unloading alone was reduced from six minutes to two and a half minutes each time. Therefore, the time for each run was quickly reduced to twenty minutes, and some nearby transports only took ten minutes. The other transport vehicles also learned from Li Laicai's working methods, so that the transportation was no longer out of sync with the harvesting. Li Laicai's tractor did not have a single malfunction during the wheat harvest, and did not delay the combine harvester from unloading grain even once. Therefore, it was rated as the best transport vehicle in the wheat harvest. Li Laicai worked for twelve hours a day in the scorching sun of 107 degrees Fahrenheit, making more than forty round trips, and was never late for a minute. In particular, each time he unloaded grain, he had to spread 3,000 pounds of grain into the truck bed in just over two minutes. This was very intense labor, and he always completed it very well.

This was the first time he had driven a tractor for transportation work, and he drove so fast and steadily. Who could tell that he was fitted with a pair of artificial legs? The wheat harvest passed, and he was already able to master the performance of the tractor very skillfully.

On the morning of June 21st, a few days after the transition to summer planting, this was a day that Li Laicai would never forget. He was about to test-drive the new Stalin No. 80 tractor to plow the land. He stepped into the cockpit, carefully checked the instruments, and tested the control lever, accelerator... The tractor moved forward.

The rising sun shone on the gleaming machine body. He galloped across the vast wilderness, and wherever the tractor passed, black soil could be seen rolling over. A happy smile appeared on his dark face.

His ideal has been realized!

    失去双脚的革命残废军人学会了开拖拉机
    田之川
    在朝鲜战场上失去了双脚的革命残废军人李来财同志，来到河南省国营博爱农场的时间并不算长，然而他那充沛的活力，坚决的意志，已经在全农场传颂着。他已经是一个非常卓越的拖拉机手。
    李来财同志是一九四八年参军的，在解放战争期间立过二等功，被评为全旅的模范党员，他所领导的班又是全旅的模范班。一九五○年美帝国主义把战火从朝鲜燃烧到了祖国的边境，李来财参加了中国人民志愿军出国抗美援朝。一次，他带一个班在三尺厚的雪山上同敌人展开了激烈的战斗。他在阵地上向党宣誓：人在阵地在，决不许敌人越过山头。他一连打退了敌人七次冲锋，坚守阵地四个多小时，终于援军来了，击溃了敌人。当最后完成任务的时候，他的脚被冻坏了，在不得已的情况下，只得从膝盖下边锯去了双脚。
    使他感到遗憾的是：今后不能重上前线消灭美李匪军，而且，失去了双脚后怎样生活下去？难道一生叫党和人民照顾下去吗？每天他为这些问题苦恼着。
    有一次教导员给他谈：“苏联有一个无脚飞将军，失去脚以后，仍然会开飞机。只要有文化、技术，锻炼好身体，一样可以参加祖国建设。”他听了这番话，当天兴奋得睡不着觉，他想：“无脚飞将军能驾驶飞机，我要学会开拖拉机。”从此他就一心一意要恢复身体的健康。不到半年他的身体基本好转了。装上了假脚，他拄着双拐练习走路。他不放松一点时间，腿磨破了也不愿休息。不几天就练习丢开拐杖走路，开始时左右摇摆，手腿无力，跌倒了爬起来，再跌倒再爬起来，最后终于学会了不拿拐杖走路。
    从此，他的活动范围广泛了，打乒乓球、排球，盘单杠，打水，锄菜园，什么都学会了。不知摔了多少跤又学会了骑自行车。打饭洗衣自己都干起来。一九五○年出国时，他的体重是一百三十斤，负伤后瘦到八十斤，这时却增加到一百三十八斤了。
    由于在战场上树立的功勋，他获得了一等功臣的称号和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国颁发的勋章。他离开朝鲜后，带着荣誉来到了河南省革命残废军人学校，正如在刚负伤时教导员对他说的，摆在他面前有两个任务——学习文化和技术。悲惨的童年，没有可能使他上学，后来虽然学过一点文化，几乎都忘了，他决心从头学起。那时领导方面为照顾他的身体，只准每日学二小时，他要求学五个小时，领导上不批准；要是偷偷自学，医生也不答应。可是李来财同志在休息时间脑子里总想着学的字怎样写，怎样用。他如饥如渴地学习着文化，三年如一日，从未间断过，每门功课的考试成绩都在九十分以上，一九五三年经测验合格，从高小班转入了初中班。
    一九五四年学校领导方面决定他和另三个同志试学驾驶汽车和拖拉机。他多么兴奋啊！他向党交了保证书，决心学好，决不后退。这时他脑子出现了一连串的希望：当一个优秀的拖拉机手，给农民耕地，使他们永远摆脱繁重的劳动。
    学校里没有拖拉机，就先学习驾驶汽车。他懂得光有在战场上的勇敢和在医院时的毅力还不够，必须在技术上钻研，不过四个月的时间他完全学通了汽车和拖拉机构造的基本原理、操纵方法和怎样排除故障。
    六月份开始实习驾驶了，首先碰到一个最大困难，就是假脚蹬油门和离合器掌握不了车速和油量，车不听指挥，一连试了几天还是不行。他和另一个同志共同研究这个问题，在休息时就拿桌椅作假设试验。经过三四天的苦思和试验，他找到了原因，就是有真脚的人可以用脚尖运用自如地蹬油门，自己光用膝盖往下压假腿没有准头。他想个办法：用大腿的力量推动膝盖，膝盖推动假脚；大腿用力时稍微抬起，使大腿和假脚基本上形成一条直线。在汽车上这样一试验，效果很好。经过三四天，他就很快地学会了紧急减速换档、紧急停车。由于断了双肢带来的技术上的困难基本解决了。他可以在校院内自由自在地驾驶着各式各样的汽车了。
    今年五月他被派到博爱农场实习。五月是全年农业最紧张的夏收夏种季节。李来财同志被分配当二八号拖拉机助手，在麦收中拖平板车搞运麦工作。这个农场一向是一架收割机收的麦子由一辆拖车运不完。收割机每二十分钟即收一种子箱，而拖车回晒场转运一次通常要三十分钟，收割和运粮脱了节。恰恰李来财被分配当助手的这架拖拉机又是全农场马力最小，行速最慢的一架。为了改变运输落后于收割的状态，他首先同他的车长商量，决定在运输的每一个环节上，都争取缩短时间，把每次运转时间缩短到二十分钟。他爱护机器像爱护自己的眼珠子一样，有一点时间就细心地检查机器引擎、油门、电路。他在短时间内又创造了很多多拉快跑的办法。像空车跑快，重车跑稳，紧急卸粮，掌握种子箱收满的规律等，这些办法都可以节省时间，单是紧急卸粮一项，就每次由六分钟减少到两分半钟，因而每次运转时间迅速降低到二十分钟，有些近处的运输只用十几分钟。其他的运输车也都学习了李来财的工作方法，使得运输同收割不再脱节。李来财同志的拖拉机在麦收中没有出过一次故障，没有误过一次收割机卸粮，因而被评为麦收中最优秀的运输车。李来财在华氏一○七度的炎日下，每天工作十二个小时，运输往返四十次以上，从没有误过一分钟。特别是每次卸粮要在两分多钟内把三千斤的粮食摊到车厢里，这是非常紧张的劳动，他总是完成得很好。
    这是他第一次开拖拉机做运输工作，而且开起车来又快又稳，谁能看得出他安的是一双假脚呢？麦收过去了，他已经能够非常熟练地掌握拖拉机的性能。
    六月二十一日的早晨，转入夏种已经几天了，这是李来财毕生难忘的一天，他将要试开新式的斯大林八○号拖拉机犁地了。他踏进了座舱，细心检查了仪表，试验了操纵杆、油门……拖拉机前进了。
    初升的阳光照在发亮的机身上，他在广阔的原野上驰骋着，拖拉机过处只见黑土滚滚地翻过来。在他那黝黑的脸上现出幸福的微笑。
    他的理想实现了！
