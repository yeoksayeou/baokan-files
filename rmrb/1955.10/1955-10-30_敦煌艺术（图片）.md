Dunhuang Art

Dunhuang was an important hub for cultural exchange between ancient China and the West.

With the eastward transmission of Indian Buddhism, Buddhist art also developed accordingly. The Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang are an unparalleled and great national art treasure created by excellent art craftsmen during the growth period of Chinese Buddhist art. Construction began in the Jin Dynasty (366 AD) on the cliffs between the Sanwei Mountain and Mingsha Mountain, about forty miles southeast of Dunhuang County. From the Northern Wei, Western Wei, Sui, and Tang Dynasties to the Song and Yuan Dynasties, people continued to excavate more than a thousand caves there, creating magnificent murals and tens of millions of exquisite colored sculptures.

After one thousand five to six hundred years of natural and man-made damage, there are still 480 well-preserved caves today. They encompass the evolution and development of Chinese classical art from the 4th to the 14th century, reflecting how the art craftsmen at that time cleverly used traditional techniques to create artistic masterpieces with national style and realism through Buddhist stories.

These precious cultural relics and artworks have been subjected to shameless plunder by imperialists. The American cultural spy Warner was one of the most vicious of them. He not only used adhesive tape to steal 260,000 exquisite murals and transport many sculptures, but also attempted large-scale theft and destruction. Cave 285 in Western Wei was one of his target for theft.

After liberation, thanks to the Communist Party and the People's Government's attention to the cultural relics of Dunhuang, over the past few years, the accumulated sand in front of the caves has been cleared, doors have been installed for important caves, and a lot of important protection work has been done. At the same time, research and introduction work is also underway, and electric lights have been installed, greatly improving working conditions. Most of the works exhibited recently in the Fengxian Hall of the Palace Museum in Beijing are the result of the hard work of more than ten art workers after liberation.

The Mogao Grottoes are located in the sand mountains forty miles southeast of Dunhuang County, Gansu. There are currently 480 caves, arranged like honeycombs on a cliff that stretches for four miles. This is the middle section of the panorama of the Mogao Grottoes, including about 300 caves from the Jin, Northern Wei, Western Wei, Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, Western Xia, and Yuan Dynasties. Mogao Grottoes Cave 285 was built in the fourth to fifth year of the Datong reign of the Western Wei Dynasty (538-539 AD). The cave depicts ancient myths such as Fuxi and Nuwa, as well as Buddhist stories. It is magnificent and well-preserved, making it an extremely valuable resource for studying ancient Chinese culture and art. In 1925, the American imperialist cultural spy Warner carried a large number of adhesive tapes, attempting to steal all the murals in this cave. Fortunately, the local people rose up in opposition, thwarting the bandits' malicious conspiracy and preserving this cave. This is a part of the full-size model of the cave completed by the art workers of the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute after two years of hard work.

Altar Ceiling (Sui Dynasty, Altar Ceiling Pattern of Cave 407 of Mogao Grottoes, Dunhuang) This altar ceiling has a tight structure and rich colors. The center part features flying apsaras and running animals, lively and vivid. It is one of the outstanding altar ceiling patterns of the Sui Dynasty.

The Dunhuang Art Exhibition opened on October 9th in the Fengxian Hall of the Palace Museum in Beijing and has been deeply loved by the people of the capital and international friends. The picture shows a corner of the exhibition venue.

Lady Governor and her Entourage Worshipping Buddha (Tang Dynasty, Mural of Cave 130 of Mogao Grottoes, Dunhuang) This depicts the scene of noble women and their families worshipping Buddha in full attire. The Lady Governor's dignified elegance and the daughters' and maids' diverse postures are vivid portrayals of real people at the time.

Dance and Music Scene (Tang Dynasty, Mural of Cave 112 of Mogao Grottoes, Dunhuang) This is part of a large-scale Sutra Transformation painting, depicting the combination of music and dance. It is a valuable resource for studying the history of music and dance in China.

Vimalakirti Transformation (Tang Dynasty, Mural of Cave 220 of Mogao Grottoes, Dunhuang) This depicts a part of the scene where Vimalakirti and Manjushri are lecturing on Buddhist scriptures - Vimalakirti. The characters are realistic and the expressions are vivid, making it one of the most outstanding murals of the Tang Dynasty.

Plowing Picture (Song Dynasty, Mural of Cave 61 of Mogao Grottoes, Dunhuang) This is part of the "Buddha's Life Story." This picture concretely reflects the agricultural production situation at that time.

After installing electric lights in the Mogao Grottoes, art workers are copying murals under the electric light.

Bodhisattva (Tang Dynasty, Colored Sculpture of Cave 328 of Mogao Grottoes, Dunhuang) This is one of the sculptures in the cave. The posture is graceful and the expression is serene. It is an outstanding work of realism in colored sculpture of the Tang Dynasty. A statue opposite to this one was stolen by American imperialists and is now in the Fogg Museum of Harvard University in the United States.

Musician and Dancer (Yuan Dynasty, Mural of Cave 3 of Yulin Grottoes, Anxi) This is part of a long procession of singing and dancing.

    敦煌艺术
    敦煌是古代中国与西方文化交流的要地。
    随着印度佛教的东来，佛教艺术也相应地发展起来。敦煌莫高窟就是中国佛教艺术成长时期优秀的艺术匠师们所创造出来的无比伟大的民族艺术宝库。从晋代（公元三六六年）开始兴建在敦煌县城东南四十里的三危山与鸣沙山之间的峭壁上，经过北魏、西魏、隋、唐一直到宋、元人民继续地在那里开凿了千余个洞窟，制作了弘伟瑰丽的壁画和数以千万计精美的彩塑。
    经过一千五六百年的自然和人为损害，今天还保存完好的洞窟共有四百八十个，包括以四世纪到十四世纪的一千年间中国古典艺术演变和发展的各个阶段的情况，反映出当时艺术匠师们如何通过佛教故事，巧妙地运用传统技巧创造了富有民族风格和现实主义精神的艺术杰作。
    这些宝贵文物艺术曾遭受过帝国主义者的无耻掠夺，美国文化间谍华尔纳就是其中最凶恶的一个，他不但用胶布粘去精美壁画二十六万，运走塑像多尊，而且还企图大规模的盗窃和破坏，西魏二八五窟就是他要盗窃的目标之一。
    解放后，由于共产党和人民政府对敦煌文物的重视，几年以来已清除了窟前积沙，装设了重要洞窟的窟门，做了很多重要的保护工作；同时研究介绍工作也正在展开，并且架设了电灯，大大地改善了工作条件。最近在北京故宫博物院奉先殿展出的作品大部分都是解放后十余位美术工作者辛勤劳动的成果。
    莫高窟在甘肃敦煌县东南四十里的沙山中，现存四百八十窟，蜂房似地排列在长达四里的断崖上。这是莫高窟全景的中段，包括晋、北魏、西魏、隋、唐、五代、宋、西夏、元等时代洞窟约三百个。莫高窟第二八五窟开建于西魏大统四年至五年（公元五三八至五三九），窟内描绘着伏羲女娲等古代神话和佛教故事，弘伟精丽，保存完好，是研究我国古代文化艺术极珍贵的资料。一九二五年美帝国主义文化间谍华尔纳，曾携带大批胶布，企图把这个洞窟的壁画全部盗走，幸亏当地人民起来反对，才粉碎了匪徒们的恶毒阴谋，保存了这个洞窟。这是敦煌文物研究所的美术工作者经过了两年辛勤劳动才完成的该窟原大模型的一部分。
    藻井（隋，敦煌莫高窟第四○七窟藻井图案）这幅藻井结构紧严色彩沉丽，中心部分天女飞翔，动物奔跑，生动活泼，是隋代杰出的藻井图案之一。
    敦煌艺术展览于十月九日在北京故宫博物院奉先殿开幕后，深受首都人民和国际友人的热爱。图为展览会场的一角。
    都督夫人礼佛图（唐，敦煌莫高窟一三○窟壁画）这是描写贵妇人及眷属盛装礼佛的场面，都督夫人的雍容华贵，女儿侍婢的变化多姿，都是当时现实人物生动的写照。
    舞乐图（唐，敦煌莫高窟第一一二窟壁画）这是大幅经变的一部分，描写音乐与舞蹈结合的情况，是研究我国音乐和舞蹈史的宝贵资料。
    维摩诘变（唐，敦煌莫高窟第二二○窟壁画）这是描写维摩居士与文殊师利讲经论道场面的一部分——维摩诘。人物形象真实，神态生动，是唐代壁画中最杰出的作品之一。
    耕作图（宋，敦煌莫高窟第六一窟壁画）这是“佛传故事”的一部分，此图具体地反映了当时的农业生产情况。
    莫高窟装设电灯后，美术工作者在电灯光下临摹壁画。
    菩萨（唐，敦煌莫高窟第三二八窟彩塑）这是该窟塑群中之一，姿态优美，神情恬静，是唐代现实主义彩塑的杰出作品；与此相对的一尊已被美帝国主义者盗去，现存美国哈佛大学佛格博物馆。
    伎乐图（元，安西榆林窟第三窟壁画）这是长幅歌舞行列的一部分。
