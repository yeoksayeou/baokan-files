    Nanchang Distillery Promotes Cold Water Pulping Method to Save Grain

    Nanchang Distillery has achieved remarkable results in saving grain by promoting the cold water pulping method. In the past, this factory used the old method of brewing, and the wine yield was very low, with only about 54 jin of wine produced per 100 jin of broken rice, and the output was even lower in summer. In the second half of 1954, the factory learned the cold water pulping method for sorghum wine from the Wuhan Experimental Distillery and promoted it in its six sorghum wine factories. After the promotion, the wine yield has been increased to 63 jin, and normal wine yield can be guaranteed even in high-temperature seasons. Based on the factory's annual plan to produce 636 tons of sorghum wine, the use of cold water pulping method can save 414,160 jin of grain, as well as 10,599 workdays and 381,600 jin of coal.

    南昌市酿酒厂推广冷水拨浆法节约粮食
    南昌市酿酒厂推广冷水拨浆法取得节约粮食的显著成绩。这个厂过去采用旧法酿酒，出酒率很低，每百斤中碎米只产酒五十四斤左右，到夏季产量更低。一九五四年下半年该厂学习了武汉实验酒厂的高粱酒冷水拨浆法，即在所属六个高粱酒厂中普遍推广。推广后，出酒率已提高到六十三斤，而且在高温季节还可以保证正常出酒率。以这个厂全年计划产高粱酒六百三十六吨计算，采用冷水拨浆法可以节约粮食四十一万四千一百六十斤，还可节约一万零五百九十九个工作日和三十八万一千六百斤煤炭。               （本报驻南昌记者）
