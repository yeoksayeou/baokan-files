    A Record of the Outstanding Performances of Bulgarian Artists
    Li Ling, Head of the Central Song and Dance Troupe

    Bulgarian vocal art has a glorious tradition. The head of the Bulgarian Artists Delegation to China, Mikhail Popov, a People's Artist of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and a Dimitrov Prize winner, is an outstanding bass soloist. At the premiere in Beijing, his singing won a warm welcome from our Chinese audience. He sang Schubert's "The Wanderer" with depth and precision, and Glinka's "Ivan Susanin's Aria" from "Ivan Susanin" with passion and exuberance.

    "Ivan Susanin's Aria" is relatively familiar to Chinese audiences. This is a song of great weight. M. Popov truthfully and meticulously expressed the emotions of this song. At many emotional turning points, the dramatic effect was extremely strong, especially when the heroic Ivan Susanin prepared to sacrifice himself to save his country and bid farewell to his beloved hometown. The tragic and powerful singing was thought-provoking. M. Popov's singing was so smooth and natural that even extremely high notes could be expressed lightly and beautifully, which is an extremely valuable and rare quality for a bass singer.

    He also performed Mussorgsky's "Song of the Flea" excellently. He solemnly and humorously expressed the profound meaning of this song satirizing the Tsar's favorites. "If it (the flea) dares to bite us, haha! Then we will be impolite." These lines were sung so clearly and decisively, profoundly expressing the spirit of the music. This song is not only rich in social significance, but also requires extremely high vocal skills. He sang it so freely and perfectly, and creatively integrated beautiful sounds into the poetic realm. From this, we can see his extremely high attainments in vocal art.

    This great artist has played forty-five different roles in his artistic creative life. He has repeatedly explored how to express the deepest soul of these characters, and strived to accurately portray these different images. Twenty-five years of artistic exploration and hard work (M. Popov is now fifty-six years old) is the only reason for his great achievements. The achievements of any great artist are not accidental. We must learn this spirit of hard work and exploration.

    The singing of coloratura soprano V. Radeva is very attractive. "Kela's Love" (by Vladigerov) was sung lively and with affection; Tchaikovsky's "Lullaby" was sung warmly and gently, and both were warmly welcomed by the audience. Her performance of "Spanish Song" (by Delibes) was even more moving. This song describes a group of girls mocking a jealous young man. V. Radeva vividly portrayed this interesting scene with her beautiful singing. Her refined technique, crisp singing, and melodious and fluent coloratura are all very admirable.

    She also sang a Shaanbei folk song "Lan Hua Hua", and it can be seen that she put a lot of thought into the treatment of the tune.

    Yu. Wiener is a dramatic soprano singer. Her voice is broad and bright, her technique is mature, her breath control is natural, and she brings the resonance to its maximum effect. Therefore, listening to her, people feel that she sings freely and extremely naturally.

    Her performance of Leonora's aria from the opera "Il Trovatore" (by Verdi) was very successful, showing that she has extremely high talent.

    The audience also greatly liked the performance of Bulgarian folk song singer Yo. Karaimonov. Yo. Karaimonov was originally a law student. He grew up in a rural family of folk song singers, and he has loved singing folk songs since he was a child. After graduating from university, he joined the National Folk Song and Dance Troupe as a folk song soloist. He sang two outstanding Bulgarian folk songs: "Karaza Wants to Marry Gelkina" and "Boicho Said to Boika," and also sang a modern folk song "Hey, Golden Dobruja." The former song tells the story of Karaza, a young Bulgarian man in the feudal era who did not have the freedom to choose his own fiancée. He wanted to marry Gelkina, but his mother forced him to marry another girl, and Gelkina died of grief as a result. Yo. Karaimonov depicted this mood simply and deeply. And when singing "Boicho Said to Boika", he humorously and vividly expressed the shy mood of a girl who dared not sit next to a young man: "Because my mother and sister can all weave, but I can't, others will laugh at me: it's easy to fall in love with a young man, but weaving is much more difficult."

    The greatest characteristics of Yo. Karaimonov's singing are that it is truthful, simple, cordial, vivid and full of life, and the voice is also extremely balanced.

    The instrumental performances of the Bulgarian Artists Delegation also have an extremely high level. In performing Paganini's "Little Sonata", violinist Bo. Lechev showed amazing and profound skills. His tone has the advantages of being firm and bright, and his bowing is even and powerful.

    Although pianist Gelbova did not perform alone, her talent was fully displayed in her accompaniment of "Ivan Susanin" and "Song of the Flea." She is a performer who uses her heart to understand musical ideas.

    The performance of folk music soloist Ts. Blagoev also has its own characteristics. He first played the Bulgarian folk instrument "Kaval", which is very similar to the Chinese flute, but the tone and flavor are close to the Romanian pan flute. He also performed "Festive Song" with "Gaida" (bagpipe, made of lambskin as a windbag). His performance has a strong local color, allowing us to intimately appreciate the cheerful and straightforward life of the Bulgarian people.

    记保加利亚艺术家们的杰出的演出
    中央歌舞团团长　李凌
    保加利亚的声乐艺术是有着光辉的传统的。这次来我国访问的保加利亚艺术家代表团团长、保加利亚人民共和国人民演员、季米特洛夫奖金获得者米哈依尔·波波夫就是一位杰出的男低音独唱家。在北京的首次演出晚会上，他的演唱博得了我国听众的极热烈的欢迎。他深刻而严谨地演唱了舒伯特的“流浪者”；热情扬溢地唱出了格林卡的“伊凡·苏萨宁”中的“伊凡·苏萨宁的咏叹调”。
    “伊凡·苏萨宁的咏叹调”，是中国听众比较熟悉的。这是一首极有份量的歌曲。米·波波夫真实而细致地表达了这首歌曲的情感。在许多情感的转折点，戏剧性的效果是异常强烈的，特别是当英勇的伊凡·苏萨宁准备为挽救祖国而牺牲、向亲爱的家乡告别时，那悲壮苍劲的歌声，是引人深思的。米·波波夫的歌声是那样的圆润自如，甚至极高的音色，都能轻清而柔美地表现出来，这是男低音歌手极宝贵而难能的地方。
    他还极其优异地演唱了穆索尔斯基的“跳蚤之歌”。他庄严而又诙谐地表现了这首讽刺沙皇宠臣的歌曲的深刻含意。“如果它（跳蚤）敢来咬我们，哈哈！那我们就要不客气了。”这几句唱得那样明朗、果敢，非常深刻地表现了乐曲的精神。这首歌曲不仅富有社会意义，而且需要极高的声乐技巧。他演唱得如此自如、完善，并且创造性地使优美的声音，溶入诗的意境之中。从这里，我们可以看出他在声乐艺术上的极高的造诣。
    这位大艺术家，在他的艺术创造生活中，曾扮演过四十五个不同性格的角色。他曾反复地探索如何表现这些角色的最深的心灵，竭力想要准确地刻划这些不同的形象。二十五年如一日的在艺术上的探索和辛勤的创造（米·波波夫现年五十六岁了）是使他达到极高成就的唯一原因。任何大艺术家的成就，都不是偶然得来的。我们必须学习这种刻苦探求的精神。
    花腔女高音瓦·拉德娃的演唱是非常引人的，“凯拉的爱情”（弗拉基格洛夫曲）唱得活泼而有情致；柴可夫斯基的“摇篮曲”则唱得亲切而又轻柔，都受到了听众的热烈欢迎。她演唱的“西班牙之歌”（德里勃曲）更为动人，这首歌曲是描写一群姑娘嘲笑一个好嫉妒的年青小伙子的。瓦·拉德娃以清秀的歌音，尽情地描画了这有趣的情景。她的精炼的技巧，清脆的歌音，以及那婉转、流俐的花腔，都是很令人赞服的。
    她还唱了一首陕北民歌“兰花花”，在情调的处理上，可以看出她是化了许多心思的。
    尤·威聂尔是一位戏剧性的女高音歌手。她的声音宽宏、嘹亮，技巧成熟，气息的控制自然，把共鸣发挥到最大的效果，因之，听起来，使人感到她唱得无拘无束，极其自然。
    她演唱的歌剧“流浪歌手”（维尔第曲）中的莉奥诺拉的咏叹调是很成功的，使人见到她具有极高的才华。
    听众对保加利亚民歌演唱家约·卡拉依蒙诺夫的表演也极为喜爱。约·卡拉依蒙诺夫原来是一个法律系的学生，他生长在一个农村的民歌演唱家的家庭，从小就喜欢唱民歌，他在大学毕业以后，就以民歌独唱者的身份参加了国家民间歌舞团了。他唱了两首保加利亚特出的民歌：“卡拉扎想和格尔基娜结婚”、“勃依乔对勃依卡说”，还唱了一首现代民歌“嗨，金色的多布鲁察”。前一首歌叙述封建时代的保加利亚青年卡拉扎没有自由来选择自己的未婚妻，他要娶格尔基娜，而他母亲却强迫他和另一个姑娘结了婚，格尔基娜因此悲痛得死去了。约·卡拉依蒙诺夫质朴而情深地描画了这种心绪。而在唱“勃依乔对勃依卡说”那支歌时，他又诙谐而生动地表现了一个姑娘不敢坐在青年身边的害羞的心情：“因为妈妈和姐姐都会织布，就是我不会，别人看了会笑话我：和小伙子谈恋爱倒挺容易，织布可就困难得多了。”
    约·卡拉依蒙诺夫的唱歌的最大特点是真实、纯朴、亲切、生动而富生活味，声音也极匀称。
    保加利亚艺术家代表团的器乐表演也有着极高的水平。小提琴家勃·列切夫在演奏帕格尼尼的“小奏鸣曲”中，表现出令人惊异的深奥的技巧。他的琴音带有刚毅、明朗的优点，弓法均匀而有力。
    钢琴家格尔波娃虽然没有单独表演，但她的才华在她伴奏“伊凡·苏萨宁”和“跳蚤之歌”中也充分地显示出来了。她是一位用心灵去体会音乐思想的演奏家。
    民间音乐独奏家茨·布拉郭耶夫的表演也很有特色，他先演奏了保加利亚民间乐器“卡瓦尔”，这种乐器和中国的箫很相像，而音色和韵味则近于罗马尼亚的排箫。他还用“加伊达”（羊皮笛或称风笛，用小羊羔皮做成风袋）表演了“欢宴曲”。他的表演，带有浓厚的乡土色彩，使我们亲切地欣赏了保加利亚人民特有的欢乐的爽朗的生活风貌。
