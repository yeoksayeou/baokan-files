    Guangdong Planting Water Hyacinth as Pig Feed

    Agricultural departments in Guangdong Province have been promoting the use of high-quality green fodder crop, water hyacinth, in more than 100 livestock farms, specialized farms, county demonstration farms, and over 15,000 agricultural production cooperatives, achieving good results.

    Water hyacinth, also known as broadleaf duckweed, originates from freshwater ponds and marshes in the Pearl River Delta, with a shape resembling a blooming lotus flower. In the past, it was an ornamental plant in the gardens of the landlord class. After liberation, some farmers utilized it as pig feed. Its characteristics include rapid growth, prolific reproduction, and extremely high yield, typically producing 150,000 to 160,000 jin per mu of pond area annually, with some reaching over 300,000 jin. When mixed with bran and steamed, it easily breaks down, has a soft and smooth texture, and is rich in nutrients, making it particularly appealing to pigs. The Yuezhong Administrative Office Demonstration Farm planted 8.3 mu of water hyacinth this year, producing over 7,000 jin daily. Besides meeting the feed needs of 681 pigs, it also supplies 3,000 jin to neighboring farmers. More than 130 agricultural production cooperatives in six counties including Zhongshan, Qujiang, and Nanhai have generally reduced pig-raising costs after using water hyacinth as feed. Therefore, not only are farmers in the plains actively planting it now, but also many farmers in the mountainous Yuebei and Xingmei regions are introducing its cultivation. (Li Shaoqiu)

    广东种植水浮莲作养猪饲料
    广东省各地农业部门在一百多个畜牧场、专、县示范农场和一万五千多个农业生产合作社中，推广优良的养猪青饲料作物水浮莲，已取得良好效果。
    水浮莲又名大叶浮萍，原产于珠江三角洲的淡水池沼中，形状如盛开的莲花。过去为地主阶级园圃的欣赏植物，解放后部分农民利用作养猪饲料。它的特点是生长快，繁殖多，产量极高，通常每亩池塘年产十五、六万斤，好的有三十多万斤，用来混合糠料蒸煮，很易糜烂，质地软滑，营养丰富，猪只特别爱吃。粤中行署示范农场，今年种植八亩三分水浮莲，每天能出产七千多斤，除供给六百八十一只猪的饲料需要外，还有三千斤供应给邻近农民。中山、曲江、南海等六个县，有一百三十多个农业生产合作社用了水浮莲作饲料后，普遍降低养猪成本。因此现在不仅在平原地区农民纷纷栽植，在靠山的粤北和兴梅地区，也有许多农民进行引种。　（李少球）
