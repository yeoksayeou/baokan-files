    The People's Bank of China, with the approval of the State Council, has decided to lower deposit and loan interest rates. The purpose of lowering interest rates is to implement strict economy, accumulate funds, and adapt to the needs of national economic construction.
    According to regulations, the loan interest rate for state-owned industry is 4.8 per mille per month; the loan interest rate for state-owned commerce (including grain, foreign trade, and local trade) is reduced from 6.9 per mille per month to 6 per mille, the loan interest rate for supply and marketing cooperatives is the same as that for state-owned commerce. The settlement loan interest rate for state-owned enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives is uniformly set at 3 per mille per month, and the deposit rate is reduced from 2.1 per mille per month to 1.8 per mille.
    In agriculture and handicraft industry, the loan interest rate for agricultural producers' cooperatives is reduced from 7.5 per mille per month to 6 per mille; the loan interest rate for agricultural production mutual aid teams and individual farmers for equipment and disaster areas remains at 7.5 per mille per month; the loan interest rate for agricultural production and sideline production for individual farmers is reduced from 1% per month to 0.9%, and the loan interest rate for poor peasant cooperative funds is set at 4 per mille per month. The loan interest rate for small vendors and organized small merchants is set at 0.9% per month. The loan interest rate for handicraft producers' cooperatives is uniformly set at 4.8 per mille per month; the loan interest rate for handicraft supply and marketing producers' societies and supply and marketing production groups is set at 6 per mille; the loan interest rate for individual handicraftsmen is unified from the current 0.9% to 1.35% per month to 0.9% per month.
    In terms of joint state-private and private enterprises, the loan interest rate for joint state-private industry is uniformly changed to 6.9 per mille per month; the loan interest rate for joint state-private commerce is uniformly set at 8.1 per mille per month; the deposit interest rate for joint state-private enterprises is set at 2.4 per mille per month. The loan interest rate for private industry is uniformly set at 9.9 per mille per month; the loan interest rate for private commerce is set at 1.35% per month; the current deposit interest rate for private enterprises (without checks or passbooks) is uniformly changed to 2.4 per mille per month, and the interest rate for fixed deposits of more than three months is 4.2 per mille.
    In order to urge enterprises to accelerate capital turnover and consolidate the economic accounting system, the People's Bank of China stipulates that overdue loans will be charged interest at 10% more than the original loan interest rate.
    Regarding savings deposit interest rates, it is stipulated that the monthly interest rate for fixed deposits of more than one year is 6.6 per mille, the monthly interest rate for deposits of more than six months is 5.1 per mille, the monthly interest rate for deposits of more than three months is 4.2 per mille; and the monthly interest rate for current deposits (without checks or passbooks) is 2.4 per mille.
    The People's Bank of China also stipulates that the above-mentioned adjusted interest rates will be implemented from January 1956 for deposits and loans of state-owned enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives, and all others will be implemented from October 1 this year. For the adjustment of savings interest rates, deposit certificates issued before the interest rate adjustment (including lump-sum deposit and withdrawal, deposit of principal and withdrawal of interest, and zero deposit and lump-sum withdrawal), regardless of the original deposit period or whether the due date is before or after the adjustment, will be calculated at the original interest rate within the original deposit period, and depositors do not need to go to the bank to replace new certificates before the due date. For current savings with interest payment dates after October 1, the old interest rate will be used for the period before the interest rate adjustment, and the new interest rate will be used for the period after the adjustment. Agricultural loans that have not been recovered by the due date will be calculated in stages: the old interest rate will be used for the period before October 1, and the new interest rate will be used for the period after October 1.

    人民银行适应国家建设需要降低存放款利率
    中国人民银行根据国务院的批准，决定降低存放款利率。降低利率的目的是为了贯彻厉行节约，积累资金，以适应国家经济建设的需要。
    根据规定，对国营工业放款利率是月息四厘八；对国营商业放款利率（包括粮食、对外贸易、地方贸易）由月息六厘九降为六厘，对供销合作社放款利率和国营商业放款利率同。国营企业和供销合作社的结算贷款利率一律定为月息三厘，存款由月息二厘一降为一厘八。
    在农业和手工业方面，规定对农业生产合作社放款利率由月息七厘五降为六厘；对农业生产互助组、个体农民的设备性放款及灾区放款利率仍为月息七厘五；对个体农民的农业生产及副业放款利率由月息一分降为九厘，贫农合作基金放款利率定为月息四厘。对小商贩和组织起来的小商放款利率定为月息九厘。对手工业生产合作社放款利率一律定为月息四厘八；对手工业供销生产社和供销生产小组放款利率定为月息六厘；对个体手工业放款利率由现行的月息九厘到一分三厘五，统一定为月息九厘。
    在公私合营、私营企业方面，规定对公私合营工业放款利率一律改为月息六厘九；对公私合营商业放款利率一律定为月息八厘一；公私合营企业存款利率定为月息二厘四。对私营工业放款利率一律定为月息九厘九；对私营商业放款利率定为月息一分三厘五；私营企业活期存款利率（不分支票、存折）一律改为月息二厘四，三个月以上的定期存款利率为四厘二。
    为了督促企业加速资金周转，巩固经济核算制度，人民银行规定逾期放款在原放款利率基础上加百分之十计息。
    关于储蓄存款利率，规定定期一年以上的存款月息为六厘六，六个月以上的存款月息为五厘一，三个月以上的存款月息为四厘二；活期存款（不分支票、存折）月息为二厘四。
    人民银行又规定：以上规定调整的利率，除国营企业和供销合作社的存放款自一九五六年一月起执行外，其他都从今年十月一日起开始执行。对储蓄利率的调整，利率调整以前开出的存款凭证（包括整存整取、存本取息、零存整取），不论原订存期多久，也不论到期日期是在调整以前还是以后，在原订存期内都照原利率计算，在到期以前储户不必到银行另换新凭证。结息期是在十月一日以后的活期储蓄，调整利率以前的照旧利率计算，调整以后的照新利率计算。对没有到期尚未收回的农业放款实行分段计息，十月一日以前一段按旧利率计息，十月一日以后按新利率计息。
