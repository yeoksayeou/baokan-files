Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Thousands of petroleum geological surveyors, along with more than two hundred geological and topographical surveying teams, geophysical teams, and drilling teams, are currently distributed across more than ten provinces, including Sichuan, Gansu, and Xinjiang, conducting various petroleum geological exploration activities. The amount of work they complete increases year by year. The drilling footage completed from January to August this year alone increased twenty times compared to the entire year of 1950, the first year of petroleum exploration after the nationwide liberation. The surveyed area has also expanded several times compared to the past.

China's petroleum geological exploration teams have developed at a rapid pace. The quality of their work is also continuously improving. Now, they have not only mastered the art of geological structure mapping but have also gradually expanded geophysical and chemical prospecting work, such as gravity, seismic, downhole, and surface electrical measurements. They have also established shallow drilling teams, something China had never had before.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: This year, China's petroleum survey personnel have found many oil-bearing structures, providing data for further expanding petroleum exploration.

In the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province, a key area for petroleum surveys this year, survey personnel have found many oil-bearing structures on the sparsely populated Gobi Desert, discovered a large number of oil seepages in the vicinity of many structures, and smelled a strong petroleum odor in the newly excavated soil layers. According to preliminary surveys, the oil-bearing structures in the Qaidam Basin are distributed very densely, and some structures cover areas as large as hundreds of square kilometers. At the same time, coalfields with large reserves have also been discovered in the basin, providing convenient fuel production sites for the future development of this promising and vast oilfield.

Petroleum survey personnel have also found new oil-bearing structures or oil seepages with oil-bearing value in many provinces and regions such as Xinjiang, Sichuan, and Guizhou, confirming that these regions may contain large amounts of petroleum. In the Sichuan Basin, more oil-bearing structures were discovered this year than at any time in the past, and an oil-bearing sandy area near one structure extends for about ten kilometers. This year, oil seepages were discovered for the first time in the Cretaceous strata formed about 135 million years ago, which are widely distributed within this basin, providing direction for expanding the scope of petroleum surveys in the future. On the North China Plain, physical prospecting has confirmed that the water-formed sedimentary rock layers in this area, which may contain oil, are thousands of meters thick. At the same time, multiple oil seepages have been discovered around the plain. Geological personnel estimate that this is an oil-bearing area with good prospects.

In the Baotou area of ​​Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where people generally believe there is very little hope for oil, widely distributed oil seepages have also been found this year.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: China has recently found resources for artificial petroleum – oil shale and coal mines for oil refining – in many regions. According to preliminary estimates, these resources can already meet the needs for developing artificial petroleum in the next few years.

These newly discovered mines are widely distributed. In the territory of Rehe Province, geological exploration personnel have discovered oil shale with abundant reserves in four locations. A huge oil shale mine has also recently been discovered in the Northwest region. In addition, geological personnel have also discovered valuable oil shale mines in several provinces in the Central and Southern regions.

It has been proven that the coal deposits for oil refining in many regions of China are not only abundant in reserves but also of good quality. A type of coal discovered in the Central and Southern regions is known as the best oil refining coal in the world. Using this coal to refine petroleum, 0.8 tons of artificial crude oil can be refined from each ton of raw coal; adding the coal required for gasification, fuel, etc., an average of 2.5 tons of raw coal can be refined into one ton of crude oil.

### 几千名石油地质普查人员在各地进行勘探  发现蕴藏丰富的储油构造  并在许多地区找到了人造石油资源

    几千名石油地质普查人员在各地进行勘探   
    发现蕴藏丰富的储油构造
    并在许多地区找到了人造石油资源
    据新华社三日讯　现在，我国已有几千名石油地质的普查人员，二百多个地质地形的测量队、地球物理队和钻井队等，正分布在四川、甘肃、新疆等十多个省份，进行着各种石油地质的勘探工作。他们完成的工作量一年比一年增加。仅今年一月到八月完成的钻井进尺，就比全国解放后进行石油勘探的第一年——一九五零年全年的进尺增加了二十倍，勘查的面积也比过去扩大了好几倍。
    我国的石油地质勘探队伍是以飞快的速度发展起来的。他们的工作质量也在不断提高。现在，他们不但学会了地质构造的制图法，还逐步展开了重力、地震、井下和地面电测等地球物理和化学的探矿工作，建立了我国过去从没有过的浅钻队。
    据新华社三日讯　今年以来，我国石油普查人员已找到了很多个储油构造，给进一步扩大石油勘探提供了资料。
    在今年普查石油的重点地区——青海省柴达木盆地，普查人员在人迹罕到的大戈壁滩上找到了许多储油构造，在很多构造的附近地带发现了大批油苗，同时在新扒开的土层里闻到了强烈的石油味。据初步勘测，柴达木盆地储油构造分布得很集中，有些构造的面积大到几百平方公里。同时，在盆地上还发现了有储量很大的煤田，为将来开发这一极有希望的巨大的油田，提供了方便的燃料产地。
    石油普查人员在新疆、四川、贵州等许多省区，也都找到了新的储油构造或有含油价值的油苗，证实这些地区都可能蕴藏着大量的石油。在四川盆地，今年发现的储油构造比往年任何时候都多，有一个构造附近的含油砂地带延长约十公里。在这个盆地内分布极广的约在一亿三千五百万年前形成的白垩纪地层上，今年首次发现了油苗，为今后扩大石油普查范围提供了方向。在华北大平原，经过物理探矿证实这一地区可能储油的水成沉积岩层厚达几千公尺，同时在平原周围发现了多处油苗，据地质人员估计，这是一个具有良好的远景的储油地区。
    在一般人认为有油希望极少的内蒙古自治区包头地带，今年也找到了分布很广的油苗。
    据新华社三日讯　我国最近在许多地区都找到了人造石油的资源——油母页岩和炼油用煤的矿区。据初步估计，这些资源已能满足今后几年发展人造石油的需要。
    这些新发现的矿区分布很广。在热河省境内，地质勘探人员在四个地方都发现了蕴藏丰富的油母页岩。西北地区最近也发现了一个巨大的油母页岩矿。此外，地质人员还在中南地区的好几个省份，也都发现了有价值的油母页岩矿。
    我国许多地区的炼油用煤矿藏，已证明不但储量丰富，质量也好。中南地区发现的一种煤，被称为世界上最好的炼油煤。用这种煤提炼石油，每一吨原煤能炼出零点八吨人造原油；加上造气、燃料等需用的煤炭，平均二吨半原煤就可以提炼一吨原油。
