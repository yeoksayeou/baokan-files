The Meilian Township Party Branch Insists on the Class Line in Formulating Cooperative Plans
Chen Zhanghuai

As soon as the summer harvest ended this year, many poor farmers in Meilian Township, Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, eagerly requested to join cooperatives, having seen their superiority. In September and October, the township's CPC branch, based on the demands and awareness level of the masses, carried out comprehensive planning.

Comprehensive planning was determined through a process of formulating plans from top to bottom and mobilizing the masses for discussion from bottom to top. This was a process of mobilizing the masses and also a process of implementing the class line on the basis of sharp ideological struggle. Speaking of comprehensive planning, Wei Hankun, the deputy secretary of the township party branch, said that his most profound experience in comprehensive planning was: because the Party first opposed rich peasant thought, it was able to implement the Party's class line in rural areas; because it relied on poor peasants and the lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants, the cooperative movement developed rapidly and healthily.

Rectifying the Party Ranks

Just when a large number of poor farmers were requesting to join agricultural production cooperatives, the twenty-one members of the Meilian Township Party Branch had various different ideas and views. The more common one was that they dared not develop cooperatives on a large scale, fearing that too many cooperatives would not be well-managed. After the CPC Yuhu District Committee conveyed the Party Central Committee's instructions on agricultural cooperativization and the higher-level Party Committee's requirements for Meilian Township to promote cooperativization early, Wei Fengquan, the deputy secretary of the branch at the time, had no confidence in establishing fifteen new cooperatives this year. He even asserted: "I think half of the members of the old cooperatives will withdraw, and not a single farmer outside the cooperatives will want to join!" Other Party members echoed Wei Fengquan's views, such as the Youth League branch member Wei Dade and the Party member Zhong Longjing, who also said that at most two more cooperatives could be established. Party branch committee member Lin Shibu said pessimistically: "Let's do it if we have to! It's always a good thing to have more cooperatives, but the higher-ups have to send cadres, otherwise we won't be able to do it." Township head Wei Hankun immediately retorted: "Really not a single person wants to join? I don't believe it!" Branch secretary Wei Jisen said: "You only see two or three farmers who don't want to join and say that everyone doesn't want to join! Don't you see how many people outside the cooperatives are trying to join. As soon as the news of the large-scale development spread, Wei Yanru, Wei Dazeng and the others held mutual aid joint group meetings overnight to request to switch to cooperatives." Wei Jisen was the director of the Liaoyuan Cooperative. Out of the 128 cooperative members, only Wei Linjiang and Wei Dade requested to withdraw, and they were both old middle peasants who were wealthier than the average farmer. He said: "What Wei Fengquan said is completely untrue."

Through the facts presented, it was discovered that those who were making trouble about withdrawing from the cooperatives, those who claimed they would not join, and those who said that no one in their mutual aid team wanted to join were mostly well-to-do middle peasants. It was later found that in the Wei Laocun mutual aid team, only the well-to-do old middle peasant Wei Laocun did not want to join, while the other seven poor peasant households were eager to join.

Wei Fengquan, because he had risen to become a well-to-do middle peasant, was affected and influenced by rich peasant thought. He not only listened too much to the opinions of well-to-do middle peasants and listened less to the opinions of poor peasants, but also deliberately raised prices when agricultural cooperatives in Chao'an County bought late-rice seedlings from farmers in Meilian Township, engaging in capitalist exploitation. Wei Fengquan was not the only Party member who was affected by rich peasant thought. Among them, the more serious ones included Party branch committee member Lin Shibu and Youth League branch member Wei Dade. They wanted to find the shortest and fastest way to seek personal "wealth and prosperity." Wei Dade had repeatedly requested to withdraw from the cooperative and work on his own. Lin Shibu was the deputy township head and the director of the Liaofeng Cooperative in Houzhai Village, but he had repeatedly asked the branch to dissolve the cooperative so that he could go to Fujian and other places to transport and sell local miscellaneous goods, taking the road of personal enrichment.

At the branch meeting, the influence of rich peasant thought that had infiltrated the Party was strictly criticized. Everyone enlightened Lin Shibu to recall his past life. Before liberation, he had worked as a long-term laborer for landlords for six years, without land or property. He only received 1.6 mu of land and a house after the land reform. In the criticism, everyone pointed out that he should not abandon his leadership of the cooperative and not care about the poor farmers in the township simply because the early rice harvest this year was poor, and only think about going to make money by trading goods. Everyone criticized him, saying: "You also ventured out before liberation, why don't you think about what you got when you fled to other places back then? But now, when everyone is suffering from disaster, you are only thinking about taking the road of personal enrichment!" Under everyone's enlightenment and education, Lin Shibu recognized the errors in his thinking and expressed his determination to stand at the forefront of the cooperativization movement, resolutely take the socialist road, and not take the capitalist road.

In the two-and-a-half-day branch meeting, democracy was promoted, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, and rich peasant thought was strictly criticized. At the same time, four Party members were commended, two Party members were rated as models; and finally, the branch committee was re-elected. Wei Fengquan and Lin Shibu both lost the election, and good Party members were elected to the branch committee, forming a new leadership. The branch was rectified, the Party members' thinking was improved, they accepted the task of building cooperatives, and a draft comprehensive plan was formulated.

In-depth Visits to Poor Farmers

Next, after rectifying the Youth League organization and arranging the current production in the township, the Meilian Township Party Branch convened a representative meeting of mutual aid and cooperation in the township. However, due to the lack of publicity and education work before the meeting, and the fact that most of the selected representatives were well-to-do middle peasants, only the opinions of the well-to-do middle peasants were reflected by those who spoke at the meeting. Although the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants actively supported the cooperativization movement, they could not afford the membership fees. Some poor peasants and lower-middle peasants had applied three or four times last year, but had not been approved to join the cooperative, while the cooperative repeatedly reached out to well-to-do middle peasants who originally did not want to join. Therefore, the poor farmers saw that the well-to-do middle peasants spoke a lot at the meeting, so they did not speak much, and therefore, the opinions of the poor farmers were not reflected at this meeting.

Seeing this situation, some Party members were very distressed: Did the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants not want to join the cooperative? Was the conclusion drawn from the typical survey conducted not long ago that about 80% of the poor farmers in the township had the desire to join the cooperative not in line with the actual situation? At this time, the responsible comrade of the CPC Guangdong East District Committee went down to the township and clearly pointed out that this was the result of not mobilizing the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants and relying on the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants to carry out the movement. Therefore, the members of the branch made in-depth visits and found that although some well-to-do middle peasant mutual aid team leaders expressed their unwillingness to switch to cooperatives, the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants in the team were looking forward to joining the cooperative day and night. Branch secretary Wei Jisen reached out to the poor peasant Wei Qiusong and said to Wei Qiusong: "Your team leader said at the meeting that everyone is unwilling to join the cooperative." Qiusong became extremely anxious and said: "Who said we don't want to join the cooperative! I joined the mutual aid team in order to strive to join the cooperative, I will join even if the team leader doesn't!"

The results of the investigation proved that the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants resolutely demanded to join the cooperative, while most of the well-to-do middle peasants expressed their unwillingness to join.

Clarifying Who to Rely On

However, there were different opinions within the Party when discussing who to rely on. Wei Yingxue said: "Who do we rely on if we don't rely on these mutual aid team leaders?" Wei Xilong, director of the Qunxing Agricultural Production Cooperative, said: "It won't be wrong to rely on these people!" But when it came to relying on poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, Yingxue said: "These people are poor and uneducated, they can't manage their own production well, how can they manage the production of the cooperative well?" Wei Ruiquan said: "If we rely on poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, I don't think we will be able to find a statistician for a cooperative in the future!"

At the Party member meeting, a discussion on this issue was launched. The branch explained the Party's class line in rural areas and presented a large number of facts to illustrate how resolute, hardworking, and dedicated the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants were on the road of cooperativization, and that they wanted to run the cooperatives well. The well-to-do middle peasants, on the other hand, often showed wavering, hesitation, or even retreat when they encountered slight setbacks or when they came into conflict with their own interests. Party members also expressed their opinions. Wei Maoshi said: "When our cooperative was established, we repeatedly mobilized two well-to-do middle peasant households to join, hoping that they would have money to invest more and have production experience, and also have cattle. Who knew that after they joined the cooperative, they neither invested nor actively engaged in production. But the poor farmers are not like this, now it seems that we have to rely on the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants."

The branch also examined that in last year's establishment of cooperatives, some Party members only welcomed well-to-do middle peasants to join, and excluded poor farmers, so that even if some poor farmers organized a preparatory committee for the establishment of a cooperative, they were asked to dissolve it; and when poor farmers came to request to join the cooperative, they were evasive and refused. After discussion, everyone clearly realized that they must rely on the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, and not on the well-to-do middle peasants.

Reaching Out and Educating Poor Farmers

At the Party member meeting, the original mutual aid and cooperation backbones were re-examined using the method of class analysis, and ninety poor peasants and lower-middle peasants were identified as backbones. Party members were mobilized to reach out and educate these people. At the meeting of poor peasant and lower-middle peasant backbones and at the meetings of poor farmers in various villages, the branch reviewed its past mistakes of not relying on poor peasants and lower-middle peasants and looking down on poor farmers in its work. The branch also publicized the guidelines and policies of cooperativization. At the meeting, the poor peasant and lower-middle peasant backbones were very enthusiastic, expressed their determination to take the road of cooperativization, and said that they would go deep into every corner to reach out and mobilize poor farmers.

After reaching out and educating them, the vast number of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants recognized the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives and actively participated in the cooperativization movement. The poor peasant Hongmao said: "Those who have grain mills to grind rice in the township now are cooperative members, and those who have sweet potato chips are also cooperative members; every household in the township is short of grain because of the disaster, but the cooperative members are not short." The poor peasant Wei Bihua requested to join the cooperative, she said that joining the cooperative has great benefits, "For example, the A Yang family has two people, they needed government relief before joining the cooperative, but this year they were still allocated 400 catties of grain and more than 1,000 catties of sweet potatoes despite the disaster, so they are not afraid of the autumn harvest famine." After such outreach activities, the ranks of the poor farmers gradually formed and became more inclined to cooperativization. The not-so-wealthy middle peasant Wei Yuchuan said: "Agricultural production cooperatives do have benefits, like me, a middle peasant, I have some funds, but it's only enough for one season, if I encounter a natural disaster, the funds will immediately run into difficulties!"

Half a month passed. The draft comprehensive plan put forward by the branch was fully discussed and approved at the mass meeting. Now the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants have elected a group of backbones they trust to participate in the cooperative building training class, and the work of building cooperatives has begun. The cooperativization movement in Meilian Township is moving forward.

    在拟定合作化规划中坚持了阶级路线的梅联乡党支部
    陈章淮
    今年夏收一结束，广东省揭阳县梅联乡许多贫苦农民，因为看到了合作社的优越性，纷纷要求入社。九、十月间，这个乡的中共支部根据群众的要求和觉悟水平，进行了全面规划。
    全面规划是自上而下拟定计划和自下而上地发动群众讨论而确定下来的。这是一个发动群众的过程，也是在尖锐的思想斗争的基础上贯彻阶级路线的过程。谈到全面规划，这个乡党支部副书记魏汉坤说，他在全面规划中体会比较深刻的是：由于党内首先反对了富农思想，就能够贯彻执行党在农村的阶级路线；由于依靠了贫农和新、老中农中间的下中农，合作化运动便迅速而健康地开展起来了。
    整顿党的队伍
    正当有大批贫苦的农民要求参加农业生产合作社时，梅联乡党支部的二十一个党员中有着各种不同的想法和看法，比较普遍的是，不敢大量发展合作社，怕社多了办不好。在中共渔湖区委传达党中央关于农业合作化问题的指示和上级党委对梅联乡提早合作化的要求以后，当时的支部副书记魏逢泉对今年要建立十五个新社就没有信心，他还武断地说：“我看老社社员有半数人要退社，社外农民一个也不愿入社！”其他党员也有附和魏逢泉的说法的，如青年团支部委员魏大德和党员锺龙井也说最多能再办两个社。党支部委员林石部则消极地说：“要办就办吧！办多总是好事，不过要上级派干部来，不然就办不起来。”乡长魏汉坤马上反驳他们说：“真是一个人也不想入社？我不相信！”支部书记魏基森说：“你单看到三两户农民不入社就说大家不入社！你不看看社外多少人拚着要入社。大发展的消息一传出来，魏炎如、魏大增他们就连夜开互助联组会要求转社了。”魏基森是燎原社主任，社内一百二十八户社员，只有魏林江、魏大德两户要求退社，他们都是生活较一般农民富裕的老中农。他说：“魏逢泉说的完全不符实情。”
    通过摆出来的事实，发现那些闹退社的、扬言不入社的、说他们互助组里没人要入社的，绝大部分是富裕的中农。后来查明：魏老存互助组中，只有富裕的老中农魏老存不想入社，其他七户贫农都迫切要求入社。
    魏逢泉因为已经上升为富裕中农，受到了富农思想的侵蚀和影响。他不但过多听信富裕中农的意见，少听取贫苦农民的意见，而且在潮安县的农业合作社向梅联乡农民买晚造稻秧时，他有意抬高价格，进行资本主义剥削。受到富农思想侵蚀的党员不止魏逢泉一人。其中比较严重的还有党支部委员林石部、团支部委员魏大德。他们想找寻最短捷的道路来求个人“发家致富”。魏大德曾经再三要求退社单干。林石部是副乡长、又是厚宅村燎丰社的主任，但他却几次要求支部把社解散，让他去福建等地贩运土杂货，走个人发财的道路。
    支部大会上，严格批判了侵入党内的富农思想影响，大家启发林石部回忆他过去的生活。解放前他给地主当了六年长工，没田没地，土地改革以后才分到一亩六分田和一间房子。在批判中，大家指出他不该因为今年早造歉收便放弃对社的领导和不关心全乡贫苦的农民，只顾自己去贩货倒卖赚钱。大家批评他说：“解放前你也在外头闯过，你怎么不想一想，那时你逃荒到外头，东奔西走，得到的是什么？而现在，当大家受灾的时候，你却一心想走个人发财的路！”在大家启发教育下，林石部认识了自己思想的错误，表示决心要站在合作化运动前头，坚决走社会主义道路，不走资本主义道路。
    在两天半的支部大会上，发扬了民主，开展了批评和自我批评，严格批判了富农思想。同时，表扬了四个党员，有两个党员被评为模范；最后还改选了支部委员会，魏逢泉、林石部都落选了，好党员选进了支部委员会，形成了新的领导。支部得到了整顿，党员们思想提高了，接受了建社任务，并拟定了全面规划草案。
    深入访问贫苦农民
    接着，在整顿好团组织及布置了全乡当前的生产以后，梅联乡党支部召开了全乡的互助合作代表会。但由于会前缺乏宣传教育工作，而选拔的代表又大多是富裕中农，因而在会上发言的人只反映了富裕中农的意见。贫农和下中农虽是积极拥护合作化运动的，但是他们交不起入社基金。有的贫农和下中农去年三申请、四申请，都没有被批准入社，而社却再三再四去串连原来不想入社的富裕中农。因此，贫苦农民看到富裕中农在会上发言很多，便不大作声，因而在这次会上，贫苦农民的意见就没有反映出来。
    看到这种情形，有的党员很苦闷：难道贫农和下中农不想入社吗？难道不久前进行典型调查得出的全乡有八成左右的贫苦农民有入社的要求这个结论不切合实际情况吗？这时，中共粤东区委员会的负责同志下到乡里来，明确指出这是工作中没有发动贫农和下中农、依靠贫农和下中农开展运动的结果。于是支部的委员们便深入访问，才发现虽然有些富裕的中农互助组组长表示不愿转社，而组内的贫农和下中农却是日夜盼望入社的。支部书记魏基森去串连贫农魏秋松，他对魏秋松说：“你们组长在会上说大家不愿入社。”秋松就急得不得了，说道：“谁说我们不入社！我参加互助组就是为了要争取入社呀，组长不入我也要入！”
    摸底的结果，证明贫农和下中农坚决要求入社，富裕中农则大多表示不愿入社。
    弄清依靠谁
    但是在讨论依靠谁的问题时，党内就有着不同的意见。魏映雪说：“不依靠这些互助组长依靠谁呢？”群星农业生产合作社主任魏锡龙说：“依靠这些人不会错！”而谈到依靠贫农和下中农的时候，映雪说：“这些人又穷，又没有文化，自己生产搞不好，怎能搞好社的生产呢？”魏瑞泉则说：“要是依靠贫农和下中农，我看将来一个社要找一个统计员都找不到！”
    在党员大会上，对这个问题展开了讨论。支部说明了党在农村的阶级路线，并且摆出大量事实来说明贫农和下中农在合作化道路上如何坚决、任劳
  任怨，要把合作社办好。而富裕中农则往往稍有挫折或一碰到和自己利益相冲突的时候就表现动摇、犹疑，甚至退缩。党员们也发表自己的意见。魏茂仕说：“我们社建立时，再三动员两户富裕中农入社，指望他们有钱可以多投资，有生产经验，又有牛，哪知道他们入社后既不投资、又不积极搞生产。可是贫苦的农民则不是这样，现在看来要依靠贫农和下中农才对。”
    支部还检查出：去年建社中某些党员光欢迎富裕中农入社，排斥贫苦农民，以致有的贫农组织了建社筹备会，也要他们解散；碰到贫农来要求入社则又推三推四，加以拒绝。经过讨论，大家明确认识了必须依靠贫农和下中农，而不能依靠富裕中农。
    串连教育贫苦农民
    党员大会上重新用阶级分析的方法审查了原有的互助合作骨干，确定了九十个贫农、下中农为骨干，发动党员们去串连教育这些人。在贫农和下中农骨干会上及各村的贫苦农民会议上，支部检讨了过去工作中没有依靠贫农和下中农，看不起贫苦农民的错误。支部又宣传了合作化的方针政策。会上，贫农和下中农骨干情绪十分热烈，纷纷表示走合作化道路的决心，并且要深入各个角落去串连发动贫苦农民。
    广大贫农和下中农经过串连教育，认识了农业生产合作社的优越性，积极投入合作化运动。贫农红毛说：“全乡现在有谷磨米的是社员，有甘薯干的也是社员；全乡因为受灾，家家户户缺粮，可是社员却不缺。”贫农魏碧花要求入社，她说入社好处大，“比如阿羊一家两口人，入社前要政府救济，今年受灾却还分到四百斤谷、一千多斤甘薯，不怕闹秋荒”。经过这样串连活动，贫苦农民的队伍逐渐形成了，更加倾向合作化了。不富裕的中农魏玉川说：“农业生产合作社的确有好处，像我这样的中农，资金是有的，但只够一造用，如果碰到天灾，资金马上就会发生困难！”
    半个月过去了。支部所提出来的全面规划草案，在群众大会上经过充分讨论通过了。现在贫农和下中农已经选出他们所信任的一批骨干参加了建社训练班，建社工作已经开始了。梅联乡的合作化运动正在向前迈进。
