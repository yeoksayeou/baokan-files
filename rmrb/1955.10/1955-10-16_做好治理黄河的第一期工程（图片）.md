The Yellow River, a giant river that runs through northern China and contains inexhaustible resources, will fundamentally change its appearance in the people's era.

According to the fifteen-year first-stage project plan of the "Resolution on the Comprehensive Plan for Radically Eliminating Yellow River Water Disasters and Developing Yellow River Water Conservancy," it was decided to build two huge reservoirs and hydroelectric power stations at Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia, and at the same time build three water-retaining dams and more than a dozen small and medium-sized reservoirs on the main and tributary streams. After all these projects are completed, the threat of flooding in the lower reaches of the Yellow River can be completely avoided; the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia hydropower stations can transmit 9.8 billion kilowatt-hours of cheap electricity every year; half of the river's water will be used for irrigation, and many new irrigation areas will appear in the provinces along the river; about 1,800 kilometers of the Yellow River channel, where navigation is extremely inconvenient, can be opened to navigation by ships in sections; the soil and water conservation work on the Loess Plateau will double local agricultural production, and the amount of sediment flowing into the Yellow River can be reduced by about half.

In order to ensure the successful completion of the first phase of the Yellow River governance project, with the active support of the people of the whole country and the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the preparations for the first phase of the project are being vigorously carried out. At the Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia construction sites, the mountains and plains are full of white tents and the sound of machine motors that shake the valleys; the preliminary survey of the special railway line from Huixingzhen on the Longhai Railway to the Sanmenxia construction site and the first phase of aggregate exploration for reservoir building materials have been successfully completed.

The Sanmenxia Reservoir and Hydropower Station, the largest in the first phase of the project, is planned to start construction in 1957 and be completed in 1961. In just five years, we will build this reservoir with a dam height of about 90 meters and a volume of 36 billion cubic meters, second only to the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydropower Station.

The great prospect of the Yellow River inspires our people. The dreams that our ancestors could not realize for generations will become a reality in the hands of our generation.

The "Yellow River Governance Exhibition" opened in the Forbidden City in Beijing on October 6. The people of the capital actively went to visit, and were greatly encouraged by the grand prospect of the Yellow River. The picture shows the audience visiting the "Sanmenxia Model".

In the "Yellow River Governance Exhibition," there are many charts and models showing the positive construction of flood control projects and the grand prospect of Yellow River governance after liberation. This is the scene of the audience visiting the "River Section Model." This newspaper reporter Gao Liang

After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of people in the Yellow River basin actively built many flood control projects. This is the Shitou Zhuang Overflow Dam, a large-scale flood detention area between the Yellow River Dam and the North Jin Dam from Changyuan, Henan to Shou Zhang, Shandong.

In order to radically eliminate the water disasters of the Yellow River and develop Yellow River water conservancy, in the first phase of the Yellow River comprehensive planning project, it was decided to build two huge reservoirs and hydropower stations at Sanmenxia and Liujiaxia, and at the same time build many water-retaining dams and small and medium-sized reservoirs on the main and tributary streams. This is the drilling personnel using dynamic water delivery to conduct water pressure tests at the Sanmenxia construction site to understand the water permeability of the rock.

Workers from the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway bridge construction team came to the Liujiaxia construction site to support the ongoing exploration work. Crane workers are erecting a steel cable bridge more than 150 meters above the Yellow River at Liujiaxia, preparing for drilling work in the heart of the river. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Jie

Soviet experts came to the banks of the Yellow River, working tirelessly and enthusiastically helping our people to carry out the great work of conquering the Yellow River. Xinhua News Agency reporter Hua Shan

Large-scale soil and water conservation work is one of the important links in radically eliminating the Yellow River. Through the efforts of scientists and the broad masses of peasants in recent years, a foundation has been laid for soil and water conservation work on the Loess Plateau in Northwest China. This is the terraced field built by farmers in Dengjiabao Village, south bank of the Weihe River, Wushan County, Gansu Province. Xinhua News Agency reporter Min Zhongjie

Many shelterbelts have been built on both sides of the Yellow River. Yellow River Conservancy Commission manuscript On the main and tributary streams of the Yellow River, hundreds of hydrological stations and rainfall stations form the hydrological control network of the entire basin, providing full and reliable data for the radical elimination of the Yellow River. This is the sediment laboratory of the Qinchang Hydrological Substation, where staff are conducting sediment analysis. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sheng Jirun

The Yellow River Conservancy Commission's Mechanical Engineering Team has more than 20 kinds of new construction machinery. The workers are actively learning and improving their skills to meet the large-scale mechanized construction in the Yellow River governance project. This is the engineer explaining the performance and structure of the mountain opener to the workers. Zhang Zhuquan, Henan Daily manuscript

    做好治理黄河的第一期工程
    黄河，这条横贯祖国大陆北方的、蕴藏着无尽资源的巨流，在人民的时代将根本改变它的面貌。
    根据“关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的决议”的为期十五年的第一期工程计划，决定要在三门峡和刘家峡修建两个巨大的水库和水电站，同时还要在干支流上修建三座壅水坝和十几座中小型水库。这些工程全部建成后，黄河下游的水灾威胁即可完全避免；三门峡和刘家峡水电站每年可以输送出九十八亿度廉价的电力；全河水量将有一半用于灌溉，沿河各省将出现许多新的灌溉区；航运极端不便的黄河河道中，约有一千八百公里的距离可以分节通航轮船；黄土高原的水土保持工作，将使当地的农业生产量增加一倍，流到黄河的泥沙可减少一半左右。
    为了保证做好治理黄河的第一期工程，在全国人民的积极支援下，在苏联专家热情的帮助下，有关第一期工程的各项准备工作正在大力进行中。在三门峡和刘家峡等工地上，满山遍野都是白色的帐篷和震撼山谷的机器马达声；从陇海铁路会兴镇到三门峡工地的专用铁路线初测工作和水库建筑材料的第一期砂石勘探工作都已胜利完成。
    第一期工程中规模最大的三门峡水库和水电站，计划在一九五七年开始施工，一九六一年完成。仅仅在五年时间内，我们就要建成这座坝高九十公尺左右，容积达到三百六十亿公方，仅次于世界最大的古比雪夫水电站的水库。
    黄河的伟大远景鼓舞着我国人民。我们祖先世世代代不能实现的梦想，却要在我们这一代人的手里变成现实。
