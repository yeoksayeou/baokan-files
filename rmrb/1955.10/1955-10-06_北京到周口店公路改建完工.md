    Beijing to Zhoukoudian Highway Reconstruction Completed
    The Beijing to Zhoukoudian Highway is 37 kilometers long. The work to improve the roadbed and add pavement, which began in April this year, has now been basically completed.
    In this highway reconstruction project, except for the collection and transportation of sand and gravel, most of the heavy work was done by mechanical construction, with more than 100 pieces of light and heavy machinery mobilized, and a large-scale assembly line construction method was adopted.
    Longgushan in Zhoukoudian is the site where Peking Man fossils were discovered. Over the years, international friends and archaeologists from various countries have continuously visited and studied it. At the same time, the area from the suburbs of Beijing to Zhoukoudian is an industrial and mining area of the capital. The original highway could no longer meet the needs of the increasing traffic volume. The improvement of the Beijing-Zhou Highway will change this situation. (He Shimo)

    北京到周口店公路改建完工
    北京到周口店公路全长三十七公里，从今年四月间开工改善路基加铺路面，截至目前已经基本完工。
    这条公路的改建工程，除砂石的采集、运输以外，大部分笨重工作都采用机械施工，计动用了轻重机械一百多部，并采取了大流水作业施工方法。
    周口店龙骨山是中国猿人化石发掘地，历年来国际友人和各国考古家，曾不断地前往参观研究，同时北京郊区到周口店是首都的工矿地区，原来的公路已经不能满足日益增长的交通量的需要。京周公路的改善将可改变这种情况。（何世莫）
