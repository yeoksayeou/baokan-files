Large-scale Development of Agricultural Cooperatives is Entirely Possible
Shen Changchun, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Hua Chuan County Committee

Hua Chuan County, Heilongjiang Province, began piloting five agricultural production cooperatives in 1952. By the spring of 1954, the county had developed 188 cooperatives, with member households accounting for 18.6% of the total. These cooperatives generally operated well, and the vast majority of member farmers increased their income compared to before. A new atmosphere emerged in the countryside, and collectivization became the central topic of discussion. The broad masses of farmers, especially the poor, placed their hopes on collectivization. During the fallow season of 1954, a high tide of collectivization emerged in the rural areas of Hua Chuan. More than 800 mutual aid teams throughout the county registered to establish cooperatives after the autumn harvest. Among them, more than 550 mutual aid teams had already set up the framework for cooperatives during the fallow season. Mutual aid teams that did not meet the conditions were also actively preparing to strive for the establishment of cooperatives. At the same time, the old cooperatives were also planning to expand. Thus, from the autumn of last year to the spring of this year, another 268 new cooperatives were established in the county, increasing the proportion of member households from 18.6% of the total to 51.4%.

Some people worry that with more cooperatives developing, there will be more problems, making them difficult to consolidate. Can they be consolidated? Judging from the situation of the 268 newly established cooperatives in Hua Chuan, although the autumn harvest distribution has not yet taken place, it is already possible to draw the conclusion that over 97% of the new cooperatives have the confidence to consolidate. The production of the cooperatives is mostly very good, with significant achievements in technical improvement and water conservancy construction. Farmers everywhere sing praises: "Cooperatives have brought a great harvest." The county planted more than 29,000 hectares of wheat, with flat sowing covering more than 15,000 hectares, of which agricultural cooperatives accounted for more than 95%. According to surveys, this flat-sown wheat yields an average of more than 300 *jin* per hectare more than wheat sown using old-fashioned farming methods. The number of new farm implements increased to more than 700 sets, most of which are used by agricultural cooperatives. The 456 cooperatives in the county reclaimed more than 2,500 hectares of wasteland this year. Many cooperatives utilized rivers to build small-scale water conservancy projects, developing about 1,000 hectares of paddy fields. The vast majority of cooperatives accepted state plans and planted a large number of cash crops, with sugar beets alone reaching more than 3,000 hectares. The yields of high-yield and stable-yield crops have increased significantly compared to last year. According to crop growth surveys, among the 456 cooperatives in the county, about 80% to 85% have significantly increased production, about 10% can generally increase production, and about 5% are at risk of reduced production. If these cooperatives do a good job in the current movement to increase production and ensure harvests, they can still strive for increased production, and at the very least, they will not be lower than the mutual aid teams. In the tenth district, the collectivized area of Hua Chuan, the unit area yield of more than 3,600 hectares of paddy fields this year is expected to reach an average of about 10,000 *jin* per hectare, an increase of more than 15% compared to last year.

The success of agricultural cooperatives has profoundly educated the members and farmers outside the cooperatives. The enthusiasm of the poor peasant members for running the cooperatives has been further enhanced. Most of the members who were hesitant when they first joined the cooperative have now stabilized. According to surveys, the vast majority poor peasants, lower-middle peasants among the new middle peasants, and lower-middle peasants among old middle peasants are generally actively seeking to join the cooperatives. Many mutual aid teams have already registered, actively requesting to establish cooperatives, and voluntarily selected key members to learn management experience from the old cooperatives. Some teams that disbanded during the summer hoeing season have now seen how well the cooperatives are run. They have resumed mutual aid, collectively reclaimed wasteland, and are preparing conditions to strive for the establishment of cooperatives. Of course, there are also some unhealthy factors in the existing agricultural cooperatives in Hua Chuan. For example, some cooperatives have not implemented the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, some cooperatives do not have many avenues for production, and some cooperatives have quite chaotic management, etc. These shortcomings can be overcome as long as leadership is strengthened.

Currently, the leadership force in running cooperatives in the rural areas of Hua Chuan County is being strengthened day by day, and a large number of backbone elements are emerging. All 447 Party branch committee members of the 119 rural Party branches in the county have participated in agricultural cooperatives; more than 95% of the branch committee members hold important positions in the cooperatives, and more than half have initially learned how to run cooperatives. There are more than 1,300 rural Party members in the county, of whom 78% have participated in the cooperatives. The policy level and cooperative management ability of Party members have also greatly improved. Most of the county and district staff have learned how to run cooperatives and have become experts. They are generally able to grasp the Party's policies and solve problems in the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives.

The above situation shows that the possibility of continued development of agricultural cooperatives is fully present in Hua Chuan. However, in the previous period, when we analyzed the collectivization situation, we believed that the current development of agricultural cooperatives in Hua Chuan had exceeded the actual possibilities. We neglected the actual situation in the current rural areas of Hua Chuan: in addition to the farmers who have joined the cooperatives, there are still more than 13,800 farm households outside the cooperatives in the county. According to surveys, 60% to 70% of them are households that are not wealthy or are relatively poor. They have the enthusiasm to take the socialist road. Coupled with the impact of increased production in agricultural cooperatives in recent years, they have a clearer understanding that taking the socialist road is the only correct path. In the past, we did not see this objective reality. In essence, we only saw the demands of a few wealthy farmers and did not see the demands of the majority of non-wealthy farmers. Due to the subjectivism of our leading personnel, the lack of thorough investigation and research on the movement, and the failure to recognize the new situation of the movement, many places are still clueless about collectivization, paying attention to one thing while losing sight of another, focusing on consolidation while forgetting development.

Recently, the CPC Hua Chuan County Committee thoroughly studied the Party Central Committee's instructions on the collectivization movement and thoroughly conveyed and discussed the spirit of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee's August Rural Work Conference. It deeply reviewed and criticized the above-mentioned incorrect views and analyzed the current leadership status of the Party in the collectivization movement in Hua Chuan and the attitudes of various classes towards collectivization. It realized the rationale and basis for both consolidating old cooperatives and actively developing new cooperatives, thereby correcting the guiding ideology and formulating a plan for the development of agricultural cooperatives this winter and next spring, and for the next two years. Before the spring plowing of 1956, it strives to achieve about 75% of the farm households joining the cooperatives. On the basis of the improvement of the county committee's ideological understanding, it also convened a three-level Party member and cadre conference in the county to earnestly convey the spirit of the conference and encourage everyone to analyze and study the actual situation in their own districts and villages, so as to complete the consolidation and development plan gradually and with preparation. As a result, the situation has changed greatly, and the ideological understanding of many grass-roots workers has also begun to become clear. For example, in Ping'an Village, Liming Village, Tenth District, there is a perennial mutual aid team with a very good foundation. All members of the team actively requested to establish a cooperative, but the District Committee had never approved it. After this study, the Tenth District Committee realized that it should treat the socialist enthusiasm of the farmers with enthusiasm, and it was wrong to adopt a crude restrictive attitude. After clarifying their thoughts, they actively helped them run the cooperative and promoted the village Party branch to carry out comprehensive planning, planning to expand the old cooperative and establish a new cooperative this winter and next spring.

    农业合作社大发展是完全可能的
    中共桦川县委副书记  申昌淳
    黑龙江省桦川县从一九五二年开始试办了五个农业生产合作社，到一九五四年春全县已发展到一百八十八个，入社农户占总农户的百分之十八点六。这些社一般都办得不错，入社农民绝大多数比以前增加了收入，农村出现了前所未有的新气象，合作化成为人们谈论的中心，广大农民特别是贫苦的农民，都把自己的希望寄托在合作化上。一九五四年挂锄期间，在桦川农村里出现了合作化运动的高潮，全县有八百多个互助组报名挂号秋后建社，其中五百五十多个互助组在挂锄期间就搭起了社架子，不够条件的互助组也在积极准备条件争取建社，同时老社也酝酿扩大。这样，从去年秋天到今年春天全县又建立了二百六十八个新社，入社农户由上一年占总农户的百分之十八点六，提高到百分之五十一点四。
    有些人耽心社发展多了问题多，难以巩固。究竟能不能巩固呢？从桦川新建的二百六十八个社的情况看，目前虽然还没有进行秋收分配，但已能得出结论：新社有百分之九十七以上有把握巩固下来，社的生产多数很好，在技术改良、水利建设等方面有显著成绩。农民到处歌颂：“合作社带来了大丰收。”全县种小麦共二万九千多垧，平播面积达一万五千多垧，农业合作社平播面积就占百分之九十五以上。据调查这种平播的小麦，每一垧地比用旧式耕作法播种的小麦平均要多打三百斤以上。新式农具增加到七百多套，绝大部分是农业合作社使用的。全县四百五十六个社今年开荒面积达二千五百多垧。有不少社利用河流兴修小型水利，开发了水田约一千垧。绝大部分社接受国家计划，大量种植经济作物，仅甜菜一项即达三千多垧。高产稳产作物都比去年增加很多。据作物生长情况调查，在全县四百五十六个社中，有百分之八十到八十五左右的社显著增产，有百分之十左右的社也能一般增产，有百分之五左右的社有减产危险，这部分社如果搞好当前增产保收运动，还能争取增产，最低也不会低于互助组。桦川合作化区——第十区，今年三千六百多垧水田的单位面积产量平均每垧可达一万斤左右，比去年提高百分之十五以上。
    农业合作社办得成功，深刻地教育了社员和社外农民。贫农社员办社的积极性更加提高了。在过去初入社时动摇不定的社员，绝大部分稳定下来了。根据调查，目前社外的广大贫农、新中农中间的下中农和老中农中间的下中农，普遍积极要求入社，有不少互助组已经报名挂号，积极要求建社，并主动选派骨干向老社学习管理经验。有些组在夏锄时期解体了，但现在看见社办得很好，他们重新恢复了互助，集体开荒，准备条件争取建社。当然在桦川现有的农业合作社中，也有某些不健康的因素，比如有些社没有贯彻自愿互利政策，有些社生产门路不多，有些社经营管理相当混乱等等。这些缺点，只要加强领导是可以克服的。
    目前桦川县农村里办社的领导力量正在日益加强，大量的骨干分子正在涌现出来。全县一百一十九个农村党支部的四百四十七名党支委，都参加了农业合作社；其中百分之九十五以上的支委都在社内担任重要职务，有半数以上已经初步学会了办社；全县共有农村党员一千三百多人，其中参加社的占百分之七十八，党员的政策水平和办社能力也有很大提高。县、区工作人员中大部已经学会办社，成了内行，一般都能够掌握党的政策，解决农业合作社经营管理方面的问题。
    以上情况说明：农业合作社继续发展的可能，在桦川是充分存在的。但是前一时期我们在分析合作化情况时，认为目前桦川农业合作社的发展已经超过了实际可能。我们忽略了桦川当前农村的实际情况：除了入社的农民以外，全县社外农户还有一万三千八百多户，据调查其中有百分之六十到七十是生活不富裕或较贫困的户，他们有走社会主义道路的积极性，加上几年来农业合作社增产的影响，使他们更清楚地认识到走社会主义道路就是唯一正确的道路。过去我们不看这一客观实际情况，实质上就只看到少数富裕农民的要求，没有看到多数非富裕农民的要求。由于我们领导人员的主观主义，对运动缺乏周密的调查研究，没认清楚运动的新情况，有不少地方到现在对合作化仍然心中无数，顾此失彼，注意巩固而忘记了发展。
    最近中共桦川县委深入学习了党中央对合作化运动的指示并深入传达讨论了黑龙江省委八月农村会议的精神，深刻检查批判了上述不正确的观点，又检查分析了桦川当前合作化运动中党的领导状况和各阶层对合作化的态度，了解到既需巩固老社又要积极发展新社的道理和根据，从而端正了领导思想，制定了今冬明春和今后二年农业合作社的发展计划。一九五六年春耕前入社农户争取达到百分之七十五左右。在县委思想认识提高的基础上又召开全县三级党员干部大会，认真传达了会议精神，并启发大家分析研究本区本村的实际情况，做到有准备地逐步地完成巩固和发展社的计划。这样做的结果，情况有很大变化，不少基层工作人员思想认识也开始明确了。如十区黎明村平安屯有一个常年互助组基础很好，全体组员积极要求建社，过去区委始终没有批准。经过这次学习，十区区委认识到应该热情对待农民的社会主义积极性，采取粗暴的限制态度是错误的。思想明确后，他们就积极帮助他们办社，并推动这村支部进行了全面规划，计划今冬明春扩大老社再建立一个新社。
