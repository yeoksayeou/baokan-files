Animal husbandry scientists and teachers from the North China Agricultural Science Institute, Beijing Agricultural University, and other scientific research institutions and agricultural colleges have bred excellent Chinese breeds of horses, sheep, and pigs. On the 14th, they held a forum in Beijing to summarize these research achievements.

They identified the Sanhe horse, an excellent breed of horse in China, on the Inner Mongolian grasslands. After surveying more than 700 horses, they measured body size, riding ability, pulling power, etc., and through analysis and research, determined that the Sanhe horse is a good breed in China for both riding and draft purposes. This type of horse is physically strong, has a beautiful appearance, can withstand rough feed, and has strong cold and disease resistance and working ability. It can run 6.4 li in just 4 minutes and 18 seconds, exceeding the highest record in the past Tianjin Racecourse. It also has strong endurance, traveling 200 li in just 7 hours and 10 minutes, and can pull a four-wheeled vehicle carrying 900 kilograms for 80 to 90 li per day for 9 to 10 consecutive days. In forest areas, it can transport an average of 140 kilograms more timber than Mongolian horses.

They improved the wool quality of Mongolian sheep by crossbreeding Soviet "Merino" sheep with Mongolian sheep. In the second generation of hybrid sheep, the wool yield increased threefold compared to Mongolian sheep, and the fineness increased to 56 to 64 count yarn, which can be used to weave high-grade fabrics.

They conducted a survey of Dingxian pigs in Dingxian County, Hebei Province, and determined that the Dingxian pig breed is resistant to rough feed, grows quickly, and has a large body size. They also carried out the breeding work of Dingxian pigs in the Hebei Provincial Livestock Farm and the Zhang Yupu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dingxian County. (Xinhua News Agency)

    畜牧科学工作者和教师们完成了三项畜牧研究工作
    华北农业科学研究所、北京农业大学和其他在科学研究机关、农学院校的畜牧科学工作者和畜牧兽医教师们选育了我国优良的马种、羊种和猪种。十四日他们在北京举行座谈会，总结了这些研究成果。
    他们在内蒙古草原上鉴定了我国马的优良品种——三河马。经过七百多匹马的调查，测定了体型、骑乘能力、挽力等，并经分析研究，确定了三河马是我国乘挽兼用型的良种。这种马体质坚实、外貌骏美、能耐粗饲料，抗寒抗病力和工作能力都较强；跑六点四里只需四分十八秒，超过过去天津赛马场最高纪录；持久力也强，二百里只行七小时十分钟，拉四轮车载重九百公斤日行八、九十里，可继续九天到十天；在森林区运输木料比蒙古马平均多载一百四十公斤。
    他们以苏联“美利奴”羊和蒙古羊配种后，改进了蒙古羊的羊毛质量，杂交第二代羊，羊毛剪毛量比蒙古羊增加到三倍，细度提高到五十六支纱到六十四支纱，可纺织高级织品。
    他们在河北省定县对定县猪进行了调查，确定了耐粗饲料、生长快、体型大的定县猪种，并在河北省畜牧场和定县张玉璞农业生产合作社进行了定县猪的选育工作。　（新华社）
