Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th (TASS): The head of the Soviet delegation to the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Kuznetsov, held a press conference on the 13th regarding the upcoming election of non-permanent members of the Security Council.

At the meeting, Kuznetsov said: Article 23 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that due regard should be paid to equitable geographical distribution in the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council. The Gentlemen's Agreement reached in London in 1946 also stipulated that Eastern European countries should be represented on the Security Council by a country belonging to that region. This principle has been implemented for several years, and the experience gained by the United Nations since its establishment has proven the correctness and appropriateness of this principle. Unfortunately, however, as far as Eastern European countries are concerned, this principle has been violated in recent years, with the result that countries in this region have been illegally deprived of their representation as non-permanent members of the Security Council. In the current routine election of the Security Council, some people are violating international agreements in an attempt to force the Philippines, which is located thousands of miles away from Eastern Europe, into the seat on the Security Council that belongs to Eastern European countries.

Kuznetsov pointed out that some people are exerting strong pressure on some countries in order to win the necessary majority for the Philippines in the election.

Kuznetsov also pointed out that some people are trying to say that the London Agreement only applies to the first few elections of the Security Council. This is unfounded.

Kuznetsov then pointed out Poland's significant contribution to the cause of maintaining international peace and security, and specifically mentioned Poland's active role in promoting the safeguarding of peace as a member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea and as a member of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Indochina. Kuznetsov said: It cannot be ignored that just as the international situation is gradually improving after the Geneva Conference, attempts to obstruct Poland, nominated by Eastern European countries, from being elected to the Security Council will cause the United Nations to regress. This attempt to undermine existing international agreements is not in line with the "Geneva spirit" and will inevitably hinder the United Nations from successfully completing its task of further developing international cooperation.

Kuznetsov concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation will vote in favor of Poland's nomination and expressed the hope that the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter will be strictly adhered to and that this nomination will be supported.

    库兹涅佐夫谈安理会非常任理事国选举问题
    新华社十五日讯　据塔斯社纽约十四日讯：苏联出席联合国大会第十届会议代表团团长库兹涅佐夫十三日举行了一次关于即将举行的安全理事会非常任理事国选举问题的记者招待会。
    库兹涅佐夫在会上说：联合国宪章第二十三条规定，在选举安全理事会非常任理事国时应当充分斟酌地域上的公允分配。一九四六年在伦敦达成的君子协定并规定：东欧国家应当由属于该地区的一个国家代表担任安全理事会的非常任理事国。这个原则已经实施若干年了，联合国自成立以来所获得的经验已经证明了这个原则的正确和适当。然而不幸的是，就东欧国家而论，这个原则在最近几年中被违反了，结果这个地区的国家被非法地剥夺了它们在安全理事会非常任理事国中的代表权。在目前安全理事会的例行选举中，有人正在违反国际协议，企图硬把位于东欧几千英里以外的菲律宾选上安全理事会中属于东欧国家的那个席位。
    库兹涅佐夫指出有人为了要在选举中替菲律宾争取到必要的多数，正在对一些国家施行强大压力。
    库兹涅佐夫并且指出：有人企图说伦敦协定只适用于安全理事会头几次选举。这是没有根据的。
    库兹涅佐夫然后指出波兰对维护国际和平和安全事业的重大贡献，特别提出波兰作为朝鲜中立国监察委员会委员以及作为印度支那国际委员会委员在促进保障和平方面的积极活动。库兹涅佐夫说：不能不看到，正当国际局势在日内瓦会议之后渐趋好转的时候，想阻挠东欧国家所提出的波兰被选入安全理事会的企图将会使联合国后退。这种破坏现有国际协定的企图不符合“日内瓦精神”，不能不妨碍联合国顺利完成自己进一步发展国际合作的任务。
    库兹涅佐夫最后说：苏联代表团将投票赞成波兰的提名，并且表示希望严格遵守联合国宪章中规定的原则和支持这个提名。
