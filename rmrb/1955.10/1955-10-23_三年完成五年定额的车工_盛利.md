Lathe Operator Sheng Li Completes Five Years' Quota in Three Years
	Shao Chengzhi
	After listening to the call from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, “A Letter to All Workers in the Country to Ensure the Completion and Over-fulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy” on the radio, Sheng Li, a lathe operator in the bushing workshop of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, I asked him, "How are you responding to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions?" He said without hesitation: "I am determined to complete the five-year quota in three years!"
	Indeed, Sheng Li's words were based on fact. In the first year of the country's Five-Year Plan, this advanced producer over-fulfilled the quota for one year and eight months. In 1954, he completed the quota for one year, nine months, and twenty-two days. From January to August this year, he completed a little more than one year's quota. In total, in these two years and eight months, he has completed the quota for four years, six months, and fifteen days. It is because of these outstanding achievements that he was awarded the title of Shanghai Municipal Industrial Labor Model in both 1953 and 1954.
	When the National People's Congress passed the country's first Five-Year Plan on July 30, Sheng Li calculated: From now until the end of the year, there are still 1,122 quota work hours left, and he can complete the five-year quota. After the new piece rate quota is revised, he can complete more than 270 quota work hours each month, and with a little more effort, he can increase it to 281 work hours each month. In this way, he will be able to complete the entire five-year quota this year!
	The news that Sheng Li completed the five-year quota in three years is gratifying. However, people are also wondering: How did Sheng Li complete his plan?
	After visiting the Shanghai Municipal Metal Cutting Experts Performance held on July 17, you can find the answer. That day, the visitors were attracted by Sheng Li's very skilled operation. He used automatic stop devices, cutting force clamping tools, and Kolesov tools to perform the operation. When the tool touched the workpiece, it made a "hissing" sound, and the headstock spun rapidly. In an instant, the machine suddenly stopped easily and automatically. In Sheng Li's hands, a piece of 18-inch-long, 2.2-inch-diameter round forged steel became shiny in just five or six seconds. The visitors gently stroked the workpiece and carefully looked at the tool holder and tools. Sheng Li completed the amount of work that others needed a longer time to complete very quickly.
	Speaking of automatic stop devices, there is also a story to tell here. In April this year, at the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievement Exhibition held in Shanghai, Sheng Li saw a universal lathe. This lathe was equipped with an automatic tool-jumping device. He thought: If I install a stop device on my lathe, wouldn't it be possible to ensure quality and increase output when high-speed cutting workpieces with many intervals? After returning to the factory, he made a stop device and tested it on the lathe. The stop device was installed, but the tool could not automatically retract in time, and if it was not done well, it would damage the workpiece. He wanted to imitate the Czechoslovak lathe and install an automatic tool retraction mechanism to correct the shortcomings. He drew a sketch and asked the technicians for their opinions, and the result was successful. Now, the automatic stop device has been installed and used smoothly on his lathe.
	Such a thing is just one example. Over the past few years, Sheng Li has been using various possible conditions in production to continuously improve operations to over-fulfill tasks. From 1954 to August this year, he improved 37 kinds of tools, dies and operation methods, and production efficiency increased from one to five times. The reason why he can do this, according to Sheng Li himself, is that "the most important thing is to learn from advanced experience."
	Sheng Li is not satisfied with his existing achievements. When others say "Sheng Li's production efficiency is very high," he will argue, "What am I? I am far behind the Soviet elder brother!" Yes, Sheng Li is not complacent because of his achievements. After listening to the letter to all workers in the country from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, he came up with specific methods to ensure the completion of the task: First, every month after receiving the plan, he classifies and calculates the workpieces according to the requirements of the plan, analyzes which ones can be over-fulfilled, which ones have difficulties, and what is the key? Then, take effective measures according to the different situations and problems of each job to ensure completion; second, according to the installation principle of the Soviet white porcelain tool, use a cutting force clamping tool holder, which can improve tool life, reduce tool wear, and improve efficiency; third, closely cooperate with inspection personnel, do a good job in the first piece inspection, and improve the quality index from 98.5% to 99%. He also plans to increase the speed of high-speed cutting from the original 367 meters per minute to more than 400 meters. (Attached picture)

### 三年完成五年定额的车工——盛利

    三年完成五年定额的车工——盛利
    邵成滋
    上海机床厂轴套车间车工盛利，从收音机里听了中华全国总工会“为保证完成和超额完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划告全国职工书”的号召以后，我问他：“你怎样响应全总号召呀？”他毫不犹豫地说：“我有这样决心：用三年时间来完成五年的定额！”
    的确，盛利的话是有根据的。在国家五年计划的第一年里，这个先进生产者就超额完成了一年零八个月的定额。一九五四年，他又完成了一年九月零二十二天的定额。今年一至八月，他又完成了一年多一点的定额。总计在这两年零八个月中，他已完成了四年六月零十五天的定额。正是由于这些卓越的成绩，在一九五三年和一九五四年，他都获得了上海市工业劳动模范的称号。
    七月三十日，全国人民代表大会通过了国家第一个五年计划的时候，盛利就盘算着：现在到年底，还差一千一百二十二个定额的工时，就可以完成五年的定额。新的计件定额修正后，他每个月就能完成二百七十多个定额工时，只要稍加努力，每个月就能提高到二百八十一工时，这样，就准能在今年内全部完成五年的定额！
    盛利三年完成五年定额的消息令人高兴。但是，人们也疑惑：盛利是怎样来完成自己的计划呢？
    参观了七月十七日上海市举行的金属切削能手表演会后，就可以找到答案。那天，参观的人们都被盛利的非常熟练的操作吸引住了。他使用自动停刀器、切削力夹固车刀和科列索夫车刀进行操作表演。刀子触到工作物，就“嘶嘶嘶”地响，车头就飞转了起来。一瞬间，车子就突然轻松地自动停止了。短短的五、六秒钟内，在盛利的手里，一根十八吋长二吋二直径圆的锻钢件，就变得亮晶晶了。参观的人们轻轻地抚摸着工作物，又细心地看着刀架和刀具。在别人需要较长时间才能完成的工作量，盛利却很快地完成了。
    说起自动停刀器，还有一段事儿需要在这里讲一下。今年四月间，在上海举行的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会里，盛利看到了一台万能车床。在这台车床上，安装着自动跳刀器的设备。他想：如果在自己的车床上装个停刀器，高速切削间格多的工作物的时候，不就既能保证质量，又能提高产量吗？回厂后，他就做了一只停刀器在车床上试验。停刀器安装起来了，但刀子不能自动地及时地退出去，要是弄得不好，还会把工作物给碰坏了。他又想模仿捷克斯洛伐克车床的样子，再安装上自动退刀机构，好来纠正缺点。他画好了草图，请技术人员提了意见，结果就成功了。现在，在他的车床上，已安上并且顺利地使用了自动停刀器。
    像这样的事儿不过是一个例子罢了。几年来，盛利都是这样利用生产上的各种可能条件，不断地改进操作来超额完成任务的。从一九五四年到今年八月份，他改进的工具刀具和操作方法有三十七种，生产效率提高了一倍到五倍。所以能够这样，照盛利自己的说法：“最主要的是学习先进经验。”
    盛利并不满足于他现有的成绩。当别人说到“盛利的生产效率很高”，他就会争辩说：“我算得了啥，比起苏联老大哥来还差得远哩！”是的，盛利并没有因为他的这些成就而自满。在听了中华全国总工会的告全国职工书后，他又想出了保证完成任务的具体办法：第一，每月接到计划，就根据计划要求，把工作物分类算账，分析一下哪些可以超额完成？哪些有困难？关键是啥？然后针对各项工作的不同情况和问题，采取有效措施，保证完成；第二，根据苏联白瓷刀的装置原理，使用切削力夹固刀架，这样可以提高刀具寿命，减少工具损耗，提高效率；第三，同检验人员密切配合，做好首件检验，把质量指标由百分之九十八点五提高到百分之九十九。他还准备把高速切削的速度从原来的每分钟三百六十七公尺提高到四百公尺以上。（附图片）
