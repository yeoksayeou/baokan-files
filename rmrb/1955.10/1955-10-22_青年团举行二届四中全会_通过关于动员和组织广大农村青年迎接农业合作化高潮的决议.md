Xinhua News Agency, October 21st—The Second Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League held its Fourth Plenary Session from the 4th to the 15th. During the session, the secretaries of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Youth League and the secretaries of the provincial and municipal committees attended the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and studied the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization."

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the Youth League, based on the spirit of the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" passed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, fully discussed the "Resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League on Mobilizing and Organizing Broad Masses of Rural Youth to Welcome the Upsurge of Agricultural Cooperativization" and passed this resolution. The meeting considered that mobilizing and organizing broad masses of rural youth to welcome the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization is the primary task of rural Youth League organizations at present. Rural Youth League members and the broad masses of youth should earnestly study the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," enhance their socialist enthusiasm, enthusiastically and actively stand at the forefront of the agricultural cooperativization movement, and strive to build a new socialist countryside.

The meeting exchanged experiences on how the Youth League conducts propaganda and education among youth in the development and consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives, fully utilizes the labor enthusiasm of youth, and consolidates and develops Youth League organizations.

The meeting also discussed the issue of assisting the Party in accelerating the elimination of illiteracy among rural youth nationwide and the decision of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League on awarding medals and certificates to youth who eliminate illiteracy. The meeting unanimously believed that with the arrival of the upsurge of agricultural cooperativization, the Youth League should coordinate with the education departments to formulate a comprehensive plan for eliminating illiteracy, actively adopt concrete measures, and strive to eliminate a large number of illiteracy in rural areas as soon as possible.

The meeting removed Liu Daosheng from his position as secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Youth League due to a job transfer and elected Liu Xiyuan as secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Youth League.

Sixty-nine members of the Central Committee and twenty-four alternate members attended the meeting.
