    The Shangrao Construction Engineering Office Should Correct the Error of Arbitrarily Appropriating Employee Welfare Funds
    To the Editor:
    The leading staff of the Shangrao Construction Engineering Office in Jiangxi Province do not care about the welfare of the workers and masses, and frequently arbitrarily misappropriate employee welfare funds. They once used the excuse of building a club and bathhouse for the workers to take 11,749 yuan from medical and health subsidies to build cadre dormitories and office buildings. When workers fall ill or are injured not due to work on the construction site, they not only do not provide care and treatment, but instead dismiss these workers. The hardship allowance of this construction engineering office is rarely used for workers who are truly in financial difficulty. According to statistics from September of last year to February of this year, more than 50 percent of the hardship allowance "subsidized" a small number of leading staff who were not in financial difficulty; 40 percent subsidized general staff; and less than 10 percent of the subsidies went to the workers. Director Sheng of the Engineering Office, whose wife also has a job and only has one child, has a relatively comfortable life and did not apply for a subsidy; however, Section Chief Shi of the Political Section, who is in charge of the hardship allowance, proactively "subsidized" him 50 yuan. Section Chief Cha of the Materials Section also has a good life, but surprisingly also received a "subsidy" of 40 yuan. However, many workers who are indeed in financial difficulty have not received any subsidies. In addition, this construction engineering office also took labor insurance funds to buy radios and festival refreshments for a small number of staff to enjoy.
    The workers are very dissatisfied with this phenomenon, and the trade union cadres also disagree with this practice of the administrative leadership. However, this unreasonable phenomenon has not been corrected.

    上饶建筑工程处应该纠正
    任意侵用职工福利费的错误编辑同志：
    江西上饶建筑工程处的领导工作人员，不关心工人群众的福利事业，经常任意侵用职工的福利经费。他们曾经借口要为工人盖俱乐部和浴室，把医药卫生补助金一万一千七百四十九元拿去修建干部宿舍和办公楼。工人在工地生病或非因工负伤，他们不但不给予关怀和治疗，相反地却把这些工人辞退了事。这个工程处的职工困难补助费很少用在生活真正有困难的工人身上。据去年九月到今年二月的统计，困难补助费中有百分之五十以上“补助”了少数生活并不困难的领导工作人员；百分之四十补助了一般工作人员；给工人群众的补助还不到百分之十。工程处的盛处长，夫妇都有工作，只有一个小孩子，生活相当优裕，也没有申请补助；可是掌管困难补助金的政治科石科长却主动地“补助”他五十元。材料科查科长的生活也满好，居然也得到四十元的“补助”。而许多生活确有困难的工人却一直没有得到什么补助。此外，这个工程处还把劳动保险基金拿去买收音机和节日茶点，供少数工作人员享用。
    工人群众对这种现象很不满意，工会干部也不同意行政领导方面这种做法。但是这种不合理现象却一直没有改正。
