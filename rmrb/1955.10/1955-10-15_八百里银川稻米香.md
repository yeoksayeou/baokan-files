　　The Yinchuan Special District of Gansu Province has over 500,000 mu of land sown with rice, making it a famous rice-producing area north of the Great Wall. This year, the rice is generally growing well, with robust stalks, and the heavy ears of rice bend the stems, spreading a rich fragrance. On that 800 li plain, a gentle breeze blows, and the rice paddies are like a golden ocean, undulating in endless waves.

　　The eighth month of the lunar calendar is the harvest season in the north, presenting beautiful autumn harvest scenes everywhere. Farmers are working hard, celebrating this rare bumper harvest. Agricultural production cooperatives have further demonstrated their superiority in increasing production. The Xianfeng Cooperative in Beiyangxian Township, Yongning County, dug a drainage branch ditch this year, draining more than 1,200 mu of swampy land, all planted with rice, increasing production by 430,000 jin. According to statistics from 440 cooperatives in five counties and cities, including Yinchuan, Yongning, Huinong, and Zhongwei, 95% of the cooperatives have increased production compared to last year. The output of agricultural cooperatives is generally 30% higher than that of individual farmers, with the highest cooperative reaching about 70%.

　　Driven by the agricultural cooperatives, extensive production increase movements have been launched in rural areas. Including various miscellaneous grains, the entire special district has increased grain production by more than 70 million jin compared to last year.

　　The bumper harvest has brought joy to the people and laid the foundation for establishing agricultural production cooperatives this year. Currently, more than 2,000 mutual aid teams in the entire special district have signed up to establish cooperatives. The high tide of the cooperative movement has arrived, and it is expected that 1,380 cooperatives will be established this winter, bringing the number of cooperative member households to half of the total number of households in the special district.

    八百里银川稻米香
    育庄
    甘肃省银川专区，水稻播种面积达五十多万亩，是塞上著名的产稻区。今年水稻普遍生长良好，稻禾茁壮，沉甸甸的稻穗压弯了禾秆，散布着浓馥的芳香。在那八百里的平川上，微风吹来，稻田像金黄色的海洋一般，起伏着一望无际的波浪。
    夏历的八月天，正是塞上收稻的季节，到处呈现着秋收的美丽图景，农民们正在紧张的忙碌中，庆幸着这稀有的丰收。农业生产合作社在增产方面更加显示了优越性。永宁县北杨显乡先锋社，今年挖了一条排水支沟，涸出了一千二百多亩湖沼田，全部种上了稻子，增产了四十三万斤。据银川、永宁、惠农、中卫等五个县、市四百四十个社的统计，有百分之九十五的社比去年增加了生产。农业社的产量比个体农民一般的增产百分之三十以上，最高的社达到百分之七十左右。
    在农业社的带动下，农村开展了广泛的增产运动，连同各种杂粮，全专区今年比去年又增产粮食七千多万斤。
    丰收为人们带来了喜悦，也为今年建立农业生产合作社奠定了基础。目前全专区已有两千多个互助组纷纷报名要求建社，合作化运动的高潮已经到来，预计今冬能建立一千三百八十个社，使入社农户达到全专区总农户的一半。
