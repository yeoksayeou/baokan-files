Beijing Gymnasium Completed

The Beijing Gymnasium, a large-scale and well-equipped facility, was completed on the 22nd in the capital city, outside Chongwenmen by Longtan Lake.

This gymnasium is composed of a competition hall, a swimming hall, and a practice hall. Corridors connect the halls. The total area is more than 34,000 square meters. The largest competition hall is in the center, where performances and competitions of sports such as basketball, volleyball, badminton, tennis, and gymnastics can be held. The stepped stands around the hall have more than 6,000 seats, and spectators can clearly see the performances and competitions in the arena from any seat. When basketball or volleyball games are held at night, special lighting is provided so that the athlete's vision is not affected.

The swimming hall is west of the competition hall and can accommodate more than 2,000 spectators. The pool inside the hall is 50 meters long and 20 meters wide; the springboard is 3 meters high, and the diving platforms are 5 meters and 7.5 meters high. In winter, the pool water will be maintained at around 23 degrees Celsius. On the west side of the swimming pool, there are three observation rooms, with the water separated by high-pressure glass. Inside the room, the swimming posture of athletes in the water can be carefully observed and filmed.

East of the competition hall is the practice hall, where athletes can practice basketball, volleyball, badminton, tennis, and various gymnastic exercises.

The gymnasium also has athlete lounges, shower rooms, and changing rooms. On the second floor of the practice hall, there is a billiard room and a social hall, where athletes can participate in various recreational activities. The specially designed solarium in the swimming hall is specifically for swimming athletes to sunbathe.

Currently, ancillary projects such as the parking lot specially set up for spectators next to the gymnasium have also been completed.
