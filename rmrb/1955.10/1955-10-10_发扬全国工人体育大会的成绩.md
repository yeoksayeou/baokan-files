    Carry Forward the Achievements of the National Workers' Games

    The first National Workers' Games concluded victoriously yesterday after eighteen days of heated and intense competition.

    The holding of this conference once again demonstrates the Party and the government's infinite concern for carrying out mass sports activities. On the opening day of the conference, leading personnel of the Party and the government, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, attended the conference. Various government departments gave full support to the holding of the conference in terms of manpower and material resources, and the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China guided the conference from beginning to end. This kind of care from the Party and the government is the decisive factor for the development and achievement of mass sports activities for workers.

    This conference created excellent sports results. Among the athletes participating in track and field, cycling, and weightlifting, ten people broke eight national records, including the men's shot put record, which had been maintained since 1936 for nineteen years. The ball games were well received by the audience, proving that all ball sports have reached a certain level, and the athletes' skills have made considerable progress. The reason why the conference was able to achieve such results is, on the one hand, because various units have initially carried out mass sports activities for workers in accordance with the instructions of the Party and the government; on the other hand, because this conference truly played the role of a communist school, the athletes participating in the conference demonstrated the noble qualities of the working class and promoted the spirit of perseverance, enthusiastic mutual assistance, and humble mutual learning, neither being proud of victory nor being discouraged by failure. Therefore, in the process of the conference, athletes learned a lot in terms of both technology and thought, improved their awareness, and improved the technical level of sports. The athletes' spirit of unity and friendship, preferring to sacrifice their own sports results and give up the right to the finals rather than harm comrades, gave the audience an extremely profound impression.

    The achievements of the conference show that many factories have cultivated many outstanding athletes. Dalian Shipyard is one of them. They accounted for fifteen of the seventeen players in the First Machinery Football Team participating in the conference. The fundamental reason why they were able to provide so many excellent athletes is that they carried out mass sports activities for workers. When Dalian Shipyard held a football league in 1954, 52 football teams from the whole company registered to participate in the competition, and 500 to 600 workers usually participated in football activities. It should be noted that this kind of mass sports activity not only cultivates athletes, but also, and especially importantly, improves the health of workers and promotes the increase in the quantity and quality of products. Many sports athletes are also advanced workers or activists in production. Therefore, all factories and mines should strive to carry out mass sports activities for workers, improve the health of workers, thereby increasing attendance rates and improving labor productivity. This first requires the leadership of factories and mines to attach importance to and support the sports activities of workers, help establish and improve grassroots sports associations, provide sports venues and equipment, carry out a variety of sports activities, and regularly pay attention to organizing competitions, encouraging workers to participate in physical exercise; and in organizing workers' sports activities, always pay attention to fighting against the bourgeois style of sports and cultivate the communist moral qualities of athletes.

    This conference has powerfully attracted the attention of the vast number of workers, improved their understanding of sports, and made them fully aware that regular participation in physical exercise and strengthening physical fitness are important conditions for completing and overfulfilling production tasks. Many of the athletes participating in this conference are advanced workers and activists in production. Some of them used to be weak and sick and often absent from work. But because they persisted in exercising, improved their health, and thereby improved the quantity and quality of products. Therefore, all workers should understand that there are many conditions for guaranteeing the completion of production tasks, not only a high degree of socialist consciousness and skilled skills, but also a strong body, so that the enthusiasm for production can be sustained and skilled skills can be fully utilized. And our great motherland needs millions of builders and defenders who have been trained, have a communist spirit, and have a strong physique.

    The sports results of this conference were achieved under the conditions that workers' sports activities were not yet widespread enough and technical guidance on sports was still very lacking. We believe that under the conditions that workers' sports activities are more widely carried out and receive the necessary technical guidance, more people will create better results. At present, workers' sports activities throughout the country have been initially carried out, and it is necessary to strengthen the organization and planning of sports activities in order to consolidate the existing achievements and push workers' sports activities forward, so that they gradually become regularized and standardized. To this end, we should further study the experience of the Soviet Union in organizing mass sports work, establish and improve sports associations, strengthen the regular activities of sports associations, gradually promote the sports system of "preparing for labor and defending the motherland" in various factories and mines, gradually establish an athlete ranking system, and formulate competition plans, so that various competition activities from the grassroots to the national level can be carried out in a planned manner. In order to improve the technical level of sports, on the one hand, it is necessary to educate athletes to carry forward the spirit of hard work, learn while practicing, organize technical groups, study each other, and actively participate in competitions, learning from each other in the competition. On the other hand, it is necessary to use all possible opportunities to learn from athletes from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries.

    After the closing of the conference, the athletes participating in the conference will return to their posts. It is hoped that they will carry forward the existing achievements, become the backbone in their production units in implementing the Party and government's sports policies and carrying out mass sports activities, play the role of publicity, organization and technical guidance, and continue to work hard to promote the widespread development of workers' sports activities and to improve the level of sports.

### 发扬全国工人体育大会的成绩

    发扬全国工人体育大会的成绩
    全国第一届工人体育运动大会经过十八天热烈紧张的比赛，在昨天胜利闭幕了。
    这次大会的举行，再一次表明了党和政府对于开展群众性体育运动的无限关怀。大会开幕的那一天，以毛泽东同志为首的党和政府的领导人员参加了大会。政府各部门对大会的举行，在人力物力上给予了充分的支持，中华人民共和国体育运动委员会则自始至终指导着大会的进行。党和政府的这种关怀，是职工群众体育运动能够开展并取得成就的决定性因素。
    这次大会创造了优良的运动成绩。参加田径、自行车、举重比赛的运动员中有十个人打破了八个项目的全国纪录，其中包括了从一九三六年以来保持了十九年的男子铅球纪录。球类比赛获得了观众的好评，证明各项球类运动都已经达到一定的水平，运动员的技术有了长足的进步。大会所以能够得到这样的成绩，一方面因为各单位根据党和政府的指示，初步开展了群众性的职工体育运动；一方面因为这次大会真正发挥了共产主义学校的作用，参加大会的运动员表现了工人阶级的高贵品质，发扬了坚韧顽强、热情地互相帮助、互相虚心学习的精神，既不因为胜利而骄傲，也不因为失败而沮丧。因而在大会进行过程中，运动员们不论在技术方面、在思想方面都学习了很多东西，提高了觉悟程度，提高了体育运动的技术水平。运动员们的团结友爱的精神，宁肯牺牲自己的运动成绩，放弃决赛权，而决不伤害同志的动人事例，给予观众以极其深刻的印象。
    大会的成绩表明，不少的工厂已经培养了许多优秀的运动员。大连造船公司就是其中的一个。他们在参加大会的第一机械足球队的十七名队员中占了十五名。他们所以能够提供这么多的优秀运动员，根本原因在于开展了群众性的职工体育运动。当一九五四年大连造船公司举行足球联赛的时候，全公司报名参加比赛的有五十二个足球队，平时参加足球活动的职工达五六百人。应当说明，这种群众性的体育活动，不仅培养了运动员，特别值得注意的是改善了职工的健康状况，促进了产品数量和质量的提高。许多运动健将，同时是先进工作者或者是生产中的积极分子。因此，各个厂矿都应当努力开展群众性的职工体育运动，提高职工的健康水平，从而提高出勤率，提高劳动生产率。这首先须要厂矿领导方面重视和支持职工的体育活动，帮助建立和健全基层的体育协会，提供运动场地和设备，开展多种多样的体育活动，经常注意组织竞赛，鼓励职工群众参加体育锻炼；并在组织职工体育运动中，经常注意同资产阶级的体育作风进行斗争，培养运动员的共产主义道德品质。
    这次大会有力地吸引了广大职工的注意力，提高了他们对于体育运动的认识，使他们充分认识经常参加体育锻炼，增强体质，是完成和超额完成生产任务的重要条件。参加这次大会的运动员，许多是先进工作者和生产中的积极分子。他们当中的一些人，原来也是体弱多病，常常缺勤的。但是由于他们坚持锻炼，改善了健康状况，从而提高了产品的数量和质量。因此，全体职工都应当了解，保证完成生产任务的条件是很多的，不仅要有高度的社会主义觉悟和熟练的技能，而且要有强壮的身体，这样，生产的热情才能持久，熟练的技巧才能得到充分发挥。而我们伟大的祖国，正需要千百万经过锻炼的、具有共产主义精神和壮健体格的建设者和保卫者。
    这次大会的运动成绩，是在职工体育运动开展得还不够十分普遍、运动的技术指导还十分缺乏的情况下达到的。我们相信在职工体育运动更加广泛开展并得到必要的技术指导的条件下，一定会有更多的人创造更优良的成绩。目前，全国职工体育运动已经有了初步开展，必须加强体育运动的组织性和计划性，才能够巩固已有的成绩，并把职工体育运动向前推进一步，使之逐步走向经常化、正规化。为此，我们应当进一步学习苏联组织群众体育工作的经验，建立和健全体育协会，加强体育协会的经常活动，在各厂矿逐步推行“准备劳动和保卫祖国”的体育制度，逐步建立运动员等级制，并制定竞赛计划，使从基层到全国的各种竞赛活动都能够有计划地进行。为了提高体育运动的技术水平，一方面要教育运动员发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，边练边学，组织技术小组，互相研究，并积极参加竞赛，在竞赛中互相学习。另一方面，要利用一切可能的机会，向苏联和各人民民主国家的运动员学习。
    在大会闭幕以后，参加大会的运动员就要回到他们的岗位去。希望他们发扬已有的成绩，在他们的生产单位里面，成为执行党和政府的体育政策、开展群众性的体育活动的骨干，发挥宣传、组织和技术指导的作用，为推动职工体育运动的广泛开展，为提高体育运动的水平而继续努力。
