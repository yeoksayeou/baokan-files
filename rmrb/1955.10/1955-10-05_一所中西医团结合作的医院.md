In July, a patient with severe arthritis of the left upper and lower limbs was admitted to the Western Medicine Internal Medicine ward of the Chengdu First People's Hospital. After consultation between doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, twenty-four acupuncture treatments were carried out, combined with Western medicine examinations and nursing care. Three weeks later, the patient was discharged from the hospital. The Chengdu First People's Hospital established a Traditional Chinese Medicine Department in 1951 and began consultations between doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine in 1952. Up to now, the hospital has recorded over a thousand consultations between doctors of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. Through these consultations, they have cooperatively cured some difficult and complicated diseases.

In the beginning, not many Western medicine doctors in this hospital were willing to cooperate with traditional Chinese medicine. Zhang Jingjie, an attending physician in Western medicine internal medicine, is an example. Initially, influenced by bourgeois ideology, she felt that traditional Chinese medicine was unscientific and unreliable. Once, when Zhang Jingjie was treating a patient with severe nephritis, the patient had edema all over his body, uremia, and had entered a coma. Zhang Jingjie believed that the patient was beyond saving and issued a critical condition notice, but she wanted to let traditional Chinese medicine try, so she invited traditional Chinese medicine doctor Zhang Cheng'an to diagnose and treat him. To her surprise, the patient's condition immediately improved after taking several doses of Chinese medicine, and soon he recovered completely. This fact made her begin to realize her wrong views on traditional Chinese medicine. Later, many diseases that Western medicine doctors in the hospital considered difficult to treat, such as cirrhosis, nephritis, arthritis, etc., were cured under the consultation of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. The hospital also organized Western medicine doctors to study the Communist Party's policy towards traditional Chinese medicine. Many Western medicine doctors began to humbly cooperate with traditional Chinese medicine. Now, more than 80% of Western medicine doctors in this hospital frequently exchange treatment information with traditional Chinese medicine doctors. All the Western medicine doctors and nurses in the hospital also invited traditional Chinese medicine doctors to give two academic reports, and separately organized various research groups with traditional Chinese medicine doctors to select the diseases with the best curative effect of traditional Chinese medicine and jointly sort out clinical experience. In the Western medicine internal medicine ward, patients receiving traditional Chinese medicine treatment and taking Chinese medicine can often be seen; many Western medicine doctors read traditional Chinese medicine books and learn in the diagnosis department of traditional Chinese medicine. Zhou Rongqing, the chief physician of the Western medicine ENT department, began to study traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture therapy to treat patients in 1952. Now he has cured fifteen patients with facial paralysis and eight patients with deafness.

With the help of Western medicine, the traditional Chinese medicine doctors in this hospital have also begun to use Western medicine methods to help diagnose. Many traditional Chinese medicine doctors have also begun to use thermometers and sphygmomanometers to measure patients' body temperature and blood pressure. And adopt Western medicine laboratory methods to check the patient's lungs, stomach, blood and bowel movements, etc. They believe that this kind of examination is very beneficial to helping them diagnose diseases.

    一所中西医团结合作的医院
    新华社记者　朱实
    七月间，成都市第一人民医院西医内科病房里来了一个患左侧上下肢关节炎很厉害的病人。经过中、西医的会诊，进行了二十四次针灸治疗，同时配合西医的检查护理，三个星期后，这个病人就出院了。成都市第一人民医院在一九五一年就成立了中医医疗部，一九五二年开始中、西医会诊到现在，全院已有了上千次的中、西医会诊记录，在这些会诊中，他们合作治好了一些疑难的病症。
    在开始时，这个医院并不是很多西医都愿意同中医合作的。西医内科主治医师张晶洁就是一个例子。最初她受了资产阶级思想影响，觉得中医不科学，不可靠。有一次，张晶洁治疗一个患肾脏炎很严重的病人时，病人全身水肿，尿中毒，已进入昏 迷状态。张晶洁认为这个病人已经无法挽救，就下了病危通知书，但她想让中医来试一试，于是，便请中医师张澄庵来诊治。出她的意料之外，病人服了几剂中药后，病状立刻减轻，并且不久就完全复原了。这个事实使她开始认识到自己对中医的错误看法。以后，医院里许多西医认为难治的病症，如肝硬化、肾脏炎、关节炎等，都在中西医会诊下治好了，医院又组织了西医们学习共产党对待中医的政策。许多西医就开始虚心地同中医合作了。现在，这个医院已有百分之八十以上的西医经常同中医交流治疗情况。全院西医和护士还邀请中医作了两次学术报告，并且分别同中医组织了各种研究小组，选择中医疗效最好的病症，共同整理临床的经验。在西医内科病房里，经常可以看到由中医治疗、服中药的病人；许多西医阅读了中医书籍并到中医诊断处实地学习。五官科西医主任医师周镕清从一九五二年起开始学习中医针灸疗法治疗病人，现在已治好了十五个患神经麻痹的病人和八个患耳聋的病人。
    在西医的帮助下，这个医院的中医也开始用西医的方法来帮助诊断。许多中医也开始用温度计、血压计来量病人的体温和血压。并且采用西医化验方法，检查病人肺部、肠胃、血液和大小便等，他们认为这样检查，对帮助他们诊断病症有很多好处。
