Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, October 10th. About one hundred members of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble, from the Adriatic coast, joined over two hundred People's Liberation Army soldiers and workers from Tianjin in a socialist voluntary labor project at First Island in Tianjin's Water Park on the morning of the 10th. They built the foundation for a 410-meter-long and 9-meter-wide main road in the Water Park.

The members of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble, after arriving in China, were deeply moved by the creative labor of the Chinese people in building their own country. They requested the leadership of Tianjin to participate in a socialist construction voluntary labor project together with the Chinese people, as a gift and memento to the Chinese people during their visit and performances in China.

At a little past eleven o'clock, People's Liberation Army soldiers and workers, along with members of the Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble, divided into three brigades, carrying iron shovels and pushing wheelbarrows, entered the construction site. They began their intense and joyful labor to the tune of "People of the World are of One Mind." At 12:06, news came from the construction site that the first brigade, led by Major Tradetsi and Wu Qingchun and Jiao Zhenliang, had taken the lead in overfulfilling its task.

In one hour of labor, the three brigades completed more than 370 cubic meters of earthwork, exceeding the plan by nearly four times. A foundation for a main road that did not exist before appeared. At this time, gongs and drums sounded at the rest area of the construction site, and Chinese and Albanian laborers embraced each other and began to dance. Then, the Chinese workers and soldiers lifted the Albanian friends high. The guests sang "Song of the Guerrillas" for the Chinese workers and soldiers. After the song, shouts of "Long live Hoxha!" and "Long live Mao Zedong!" resounded throughout the Water Park. It was not until after two o'clock in the afternoon that the Albanian and Chinese friends reluctantly bid farewell to each other.

The Albanian People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble arrived in Tianjin on the 7th, and on the 8th and 9th, they performed wonderful song and dance programs for 5,000 spectators in Tianjin.

    阿人民军歌舞团团员
    参加天津市的义务劳动
    新华社天津十日电　天津水上公园的第一岛上十日上午红旗招展。来自亚得里亚海岸的阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团的约一百名团员在这里同天津市的二百多名解放军战士和工人共同进行了社会主义的义务劳动，修建了一条四百一十公尺长、九公尺宽的水上公园干路的路基。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团的团员们来到中国后，深深为中国人民建设自己祖国的创造性的劳动所感动。他们向天津市的领导机关要求和中国人民共同进行一次社会主义建设的义务劳动，作为在中国访问演出期间给中国人民的献礼和留念。
    十一点多钟，中国人民解放军战士和工人同阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团团员，分成三个大队，扛着铁铣，推着斗车，进入了工地。他们在“全世界人民心一条”的歌声中，开始了紧张而愉快的劳动。十二点六分，工地上传出了特拉德齐少校和吴庆春、焦振良三人率领的第一大队首先超额完成了任务的快讯。
    在一个小时的劳动中，三个大队共完成了三百七十多土方工程，超过计划将近四倍。一条原来还不存在的干路路基出现了。这时，工地上的休息处响起锣鼓声，中国和阿尔巴尼亚的劳动者们拥抱在一起，跳起舞来。接着，中国的工人和战士们把阿尔巴尼亚友人们高高举起。客人们给中国的工人和战士合唱了“游击队之歌”。歌毕，“万岁，霍查”、“万岁，毛泽东”的欢呼声响彻了整个水上公园。到下午二点多钟，阿尔巴尼亚和中国的友人们才依依不舍地互相告别。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军歌舞团是在七日到达天津的，他们在八、九两日已为天津市五千观众演出了精彩的歌舞节目。
