One week after the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic celebrates its sixth anniversary. The German Democratic Republic is celebrating its sixth anniversary at the beginning of a new stage of development. The basis of this new stage is the treaty of relationship between the German Democratic Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Therefore, all German patriots who regard the German Democratic Republic as a strong bulwark in the struggle for a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany celebrate this festival with a deeper sense of gratitude to our common elder brother—the great and powerful Soviet people—than ever before.

Through the historic victory it achieved in the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union liberated the German people from the shackles of Hitlerite fascism. The Soviet Union made it possible for the German working people to establish an anti-fascist democratic system in eastern Germany and to establish the first state of workers and peasants in German history. The Soviet Union is a loyal friend of the German Democratic Republic. It has continuously provided the German Democratic Republic with generous and selfless assistance and has unremittingly safeguarded the national interests of the entire German people on every occasion. The historically significant treaty signed on September 20 helps to further consolidate the friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, helps to restore German unity on the basis of peace and democracy, and helps to promote peace and security in Europe. This is the result of the close and friendly relationship between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union.

The German Democratic Republic is the first country in German history to be ruled by workers and working peasants, and it is supported by all democratic and patriotic forces of the German people. Thanks to the labor enthusiasm of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, thanks to the creative initiative of production innovators, activists, and meritorious technicians and scientists, and thanks to the mutual assistance and friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various people's democratic countries, the working people of the German Democratic Republic have achieved proud accomplishments in building the foundations of socialism under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

In the sixth year since its founding, the German Democratic Republic has also shown significant progress in political, economic, and cultural aspects.

For example, as early as 1954, the total industrial output had already exceeded the pre-war level by one time. This upward trend continued in the first half of 1955. If we compare the second quarter of 1955 with the same period last year, we can see that the total industrial output increased by 12 percent, labor productivity increased by 11 percent, wages increased by 3 percent, and the production of consumer goods increased by 12 percent.

By the end of September 1955, it was already clear that the national economic plan would be overfulfilled. The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic decided on September 29 of this year to increase the industrial production plan targets for 1955 by approximately 360 million marks in terms of product value, and to increase the sales of goods by approximately 600 million marks. This thriving development of the German Democratic Republic is the result of the outstanding work of excellent production workers and engineers, socialist emulation, and the adoption of new production methods in many industrial sectors.

In the rural areas of the German Democratic Republic, 18 percent of the land today belongs to agricultural production cooperatives, 4 percent belongs to state-owned farms, and 57 percent belongs to individual farmers. The large landlords have been driven away. The living standards of the peasants are constantly improving. The working people know that this development in the countryside is only possible after driving away the Junkers and fascists and carrying out democratic land reform. Last month, they proudly celebrated the tenth anniversary of the democratic land reform. Land reform was the greatest and most effective revolutionary mass movement in German history up to that time. It gave the worker-peasant alliance a consolidated material foundation and new content.

The democratic higher education cause of the German Democratic Republic is also celebrating its tenth anniversary this year. Like other fields of cultural life, the cause of higher education also demonstrates the unstoppable progress of the worker-peasant state. Since the 1945-1946 academic year, the number of students in colleges and universities has increased by seven and a half times, not including correspondence courses and worker-peasant colleges. This means that there is one college student for every two hundred and five residents in the German Democratic Republic. In contrast, there is only one college student for every four hundred residents in West Germany. In the German Democratic Republic, children of workers and peasants account for 55 percent of the students in colleges and universities, while in West Germany, they account for less than 5 percent. Academic relations between the German Democratic Republic and countries in the peace and democracy camp are becoming closer, and the scope of exchanging students is also expanding. Not only in education, but also in other aspects of cultural and economic life, the German Democratic Republic has proven to be increasingly attractive to the working people of West Germany.

The growing economic strength and the prosperous development of industry, agriculture, transportation, and trade have led to an increase of more than 600 percent in the exports of the German Democratic Republic by September 1955 compared to 1950. The German Democratic Republic now has trade relations with nearly one hundred countries and has signed long-term agreements with twenty capitalist countries.

The German Democratic Republic has made great progress in domestic and foreign affairs in the six years since its founding. Participating in the Moscow Conference and the Warsaw Conference were important milestones on its path forward. The treaty of relationship concluded between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union has historical significance. Therefore, the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany, which unites all German patriots who are fighting for the restoration of German unity on the basis of peace and democracy, said in its call to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic: "October 7 is a day to rejoice in the achievements of the German Democratic Republic in domestic and foreign affairs, a day to be proud of the great construction achievements and the fruits of the working people, and at the same time, a day to express a patriotic sense of responsibility for the destiny of the indivisible German nation."

In contrast, in West Germany, due to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and remilitarization, the situation of the working people has greatly deteriorated, and the monopoly giants and Junker landlords have intensified their exploitation. But at the same time, the resistance to the increasingly heavy burdens imposed on the working people by remilitarization is also increasing. The working people who actively participated in the recent struggles for wage increases in West Germany—the largest struggles since 1945—numbered about four million. The movement against the Paris Agreement also continues to develop extensively.

In view of the fact that the two parts of Germany are developing in completely different directions, it is necessary for the working people of the German Democratic Republic to work harder to consolidate their achievements in politics, economy, and society, as well as the achievements of democratic reforms and socialist construction. All of this is related to the interests of all the working people of Germany. Therefore, strengthening the worker-peasant regime of the German Democratic Republic and continuing to firmly implement its policies are of the utmost national significance for the entire German people.

The German Democratic Republic is the first truly peace-loving and democratic country in German history. It will never allow the whole of Germany to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the spirit of the Paris Agreement. Restoring German unity is the main task facing the German people, and it is first and foremost a matter for the Germans themselves. However, restoring German unity is only possible after removing the main obstacles on this road—that is, after reaching an agreement on abolishing the Paris Agreement and canceling the European military group. Because the Paris Agreement and West Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization hinder the restoration of German unity on the basis of peace and democracy.

As Comrade Walter Ulbricht, Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, said at the People's Chamber meeting on September 26 this year, the German Democratic Republic is a legitimate German state, and its policy is a symbol of the future of Germany, because it is the only German state with full sovereignty. Only in the German Democratic Republic has a solid foundation been established for developing Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country. In this country, the working class has formed an alliance with the working peasants, intellectuals, and other working people, and has taken state power into their own hands. The German Democratic Republic is an example for the whole of Germany in establishing peaceful and friendly relations with the people of other countries. Its relations with other countries are based on complete equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.

The relationship between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China has also developed on this basis. The six years since the founding of the German Democratic Republic have also been six years of friendship with the People's Republic of China. This friendship between our two peoples is constantly strengthening. The visits of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and Vice Premier Peng Dehuai to the German Democratic Republic, the visit of the government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the People's Republic of China, the joint communiqué of the talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Premier Grotewohl, and especially the order of Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China on ending the state of war between China and Germany, are all milestones marking the development of Sino-German relations.

The friendship between our two peoples is unbreakable and is based on a new type of relationship between countries where the working people are masters of their own affairs. This friendly cooperative relationship not only conforms to the interests of our two peoples and helps the socialist construction of our two countries, but also helps to strengthen the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to defend world peace.

It is of great significance that the representative of the People's Republic of China declared at the Warsaw Conference that the Chinese people are always ready to support the cause of defending peace in Europe. For the German Democratic Republic, which faithfully fulfills its obligations undertaken at the Warsaw Conference, this statement means an increase in its own strength and a valuable source of confidence in the victory of its cause.

The Chinese people have shown on every occasion that they are closely united with the new Germany and have voiced their loud calls for the benefit of the German people. The people of the German Democratic Republic cherish this friendship very much and strive to support the Chinese people in completing their great construction tasks. They are infinitely delighted by the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people.

Like our friendship, the struggles of our two peoples inextricably link us together. The German people are proud that they have friends like the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in the struggle for a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany and in strengthening the only peace-loving and democratic German state—the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, we also celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic on October 7 as a festival of friendship between our peoples, and with brotherly affection, we wish the government of the People's Republic of China and the great Chinese people continued brilliant achievements in socialist construction, in the struggle to achieve their just demands, and in the struggle to defend peace.

    庆祝德意志民主共和国成立六周年
    德意志民主共和国驻华大使馆临时代办阿·葛鲁特纳
    在中华人民共和国成立六周年后的一星期，德意志民主共和国庆祝它的成立六周年。德意志民主共和国是在它开始新的发展阶段的情况下庆祝六周年的。这个新阶段的基础就是德意志民主共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟关系条约。因此，把德意志民主共和国看作为争取一个统一、爱好和平和民主的德国而斗争的坚强堡垒的所有德国爱国人士，比以前更强烈地怀着对我们共同的老大哥——伟大和强有力的苏联人民的深厚感激的心情，来庆祝这一节日。
    苏联通过在伟大的卫国战争中所取得的历史性胜利，把德国人民从希特勒法西斯枷锁下解放了出来。苏联使德国劳动人民有可能在德国东部建立起反法西斯的民主制度，并成立了德国历史上第一个工农国家。苏联是德意志民主共和国的忠实朋友，它不断地给予德意志民主共和国慷慨无私的援助，并在任何场合都不懈地维护全体德国人民的民族利益。九月二十日签订的具有历史意义的条约，有助于进一步巩固德苏两国人民之间的友谊，有助于在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国的统一，并有助于欧洲的和平与安全。这是德意志民主共和国和苏联两国亲密友好关系的结果。
    德意志民主共和国是德国历史上由工人和劳动农民执政的第一个国家，它受到德国人民一切民主和爱国的力量的支持。由于工人、农民和知识分子的劳动热情，由于生产革新者、积极分子以及有功技术人员和科学家的创造积极性，由于同苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家之间的互助和友好合作，德意志民主共和国劳动人民在德国统一社会党的领导下，在建设社会主义基础方面已取得了足以自豪的成就。
    德意志民主共和国在成立以来的第六年中，在政治、经济和文化各方面也显出了重大的进步。
    例如，早在一九五四年工业总产量就已超过战前水平一倍了。一九五五年上半年度继续保持了这种上升的趋势。如果把一九五五年第二季度和去年同时期比较一下，那末就可以看到工业总产量增长了百分之十二，劳动生产率增加了百分之十一，工资增加了百分之三，消费品的生产增加了百分之十二。
    在一九五五年九月底时就已经可以看出，国民经济计划将能超额完成。德意志民主共和国部长会议于今年九月二十九日作出决定，把一九五五年工业生产计划指标按产品价值计算增加约三亿六千万马克，商品销售额增加约六亿马克。德意志民主共和国这种蒸蒸日上的发展是优秀的生产工人和工程师的杰出的工作，社会主义竞赛和许多工业部门采用新的生产方法的结果。
    在德意志民主共和国农村，今天有百分之十八的土地属于农业生产合作社，百分之四属于国营农场，百分之五十七属于个体农民。大地主已经被赶跑了。农民的生活水平在不断提高。劳动人民知道，农村的这种发展只有在赶走容克和法西斯分子以及进行民主土地改革以后才是可能的。他们在上个月份怀着自豪的心情庆祝了民主土地改革的十周年。土地改革是德国历史上到那时为止最伟大最卓有成效的革命的群众运动。它使工农联盟获得了巩固的物质基础和新的内容。
    德意志民主共和国的民主高等教育事业也在今年庆祝十周年纪念。和文化生活其他各个领域一样，在高等教育事业方面也表现出了工农国家的一往直前的进步。从一九四五——一九四六学年以来，高等学校的学生人数已增加了七倍半，这还不包括函授班和工农学院在内。这就意味着，德意志民主共和国每二百○五个居民中就有一个大学生。相反地，在西德每四百个居民中只有一个大学生。在德意志民主共和国，工农子弟占高等学校学生人数的百分之五十五，在西德还不到百分之五。德意志民主共和国和和平民主阵营各国间的学术关系正在日趋密切，交换留学生的范围也在日益扩大。不仅在教育方面，而且在文化和经济生活其他各方面，德意志民主共和国也证实了它对西德劳动人民越来越具有吸引力。
    日益增长的经济力量，工业、农业、交通运输业和贸易等方面的欣欣向荣的发展，促使德意志民主共和国的出口到一九五五年九月止比一九五○年增加了百分之六百以上。德意志民主共和国现在差不多同一百个国家有着贸易关系，同二十个资本主义国家签订了长期的协定。
    德意志民主共和国成立六年来在内政外交方面获得了巨大的进步。参加莫斯科会议和华沙会议，是它前进道路上的重要的里程碑。德意志民主共和国和苏联缔结的关系条约具有历史的意义。因此，团结着为争取在和平民主的基础上恢复德国统一而斗争的全德爱国人士的民主德国全国阵线全国委员会，在它庆祝德意志民主共和国成立六周年的号召中说：“十月七日是对德意志民主共和国内政外交方面的成就感到欢欣鼓舞的日子，是对伟大的建设成就和劳动人民的成果感到自豪的日子，同时也是对不可分割的德意志民族的命运表示爱国责任感的日子。”
    相反的，在西德由于实施巴黎协定，参加北大西洋公约组织和重新军国主义化，劳动人民的状况大大地恶化了，垄断巨头和容克地主加紧了他们的剥削。但与此同时，对重新军国主义化所强加在劳动人民身上的越来越重的负担的反抗也日益加强了。仅是积极参加西德最近几次争取增加工资的斗争——一九四五年以来最大的几次斗争——的劳动人民就有四百万左右。反对巴黎协定的运动也在继续广泛地开展着。
    鉴于德国的两部分朝着完全不同的方向发展，德意志民主共和国劳动人民有必要更加努力地来巩固他们在政治、经济和社会等方面取得的成就以及民主改革和社会主义建设的成绩。这都是关系到德国所有劳动人民的利益的。因此，增强德意志民主共和国的工农政权和继续坚定不移地执行它的政策，对全体德国人民来说都是具有最重大的民族意义的。
    德意志民主共和国是德国历史上第一个真正爱好和平的、民主的国家。它决不允许全德国根据巴黎协定的精神加入北大西洋公约集团。恢复德国统一是摆在德国人民面前的主要任务，它首先是德国人自己的事情。但是，只有在扫除这条道路上的主要障碍以后——也就是说，在废除巴黎协定和取消欧洲军事集团上能达成协议以后——恢复德国统一才是可能的。因为巴黎协定和西德参加北大西洋公约集团阻碍着在和平民主的基础上恢复德国的统一。
    正如德意志民主共和国副总理瓦尔特·乌布利希同志今年九月二十六日在人民议院会议上所说的，德意志民主共和国是一个合法的德意志国家，它的政策是德国未来的象征，因为它是唯一的具有充分主权的德意志国家。只有在德意志民主共和国才建立了把德国发展成为爱好和平与民主的国家的巩固基础。在这个国家里，工人阶级与劳动农民、知识分子以及其他劳动人民阶层结成联盟，把国家政权掌握在自己手里。德意志民主共和国对于全德国来说，是一个同其他各国人民建立和平友好关系的榜样。它同其他国家的关系都是建立在完全平等、互相尊重主权和互不干涉内政的基础上的。
    德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国的关系也在这个基础上得到了发展。德意志民主共和国成立以来的六年，也就是同中华人民共和国友好的六年。我们两国人民之间的这种友谊在不断加强。周恩来总理、陈毅副总理和彭德怀副总理访问德意志民主共和国，德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问中华人民共和国，周恩来总理和格罗提渥总理会谈联合公报，以及特别是中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志关于结束中德之间战争状态的命令，都是表明德中关系发展的里程碑。
    我们两国人民之间的友谊是牢不可破的，是建立在劳动人民当家作主的国家之间的新型关系的基础上的。这种友好合作关系不但符合我们两国人民的利益和有助于我们两国的社会主义建设，同时也有助于增强以苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵营和保卫世界和平。
    中华人民共和国的代表在华沙会议上曾经声明，中国人民随时准备支持保卫欧洲和平的事业，这是具有重大的意义的。对于忠实地遵守它在华沙会议上所承担的义务的德意志民主共和国来说，这个声明意味着自己力量的增强和对于自己事业的胜利的确信的可贵源泉。
    中国人民在任何场合都表明他们和新德国是亲密地团结在一起的，并为德国人民的利益发出他们宏亮的呼声。德意志民主共和国人民十分珍视这种友谊，并努力支援中国人民完成他们的伟大建设任务。他们对中国人民的光辉成就感到无限的欢欣鼓舞。
    如同我们的友谊一样，我们两国人民的斗争把我们不可分地联结在一起。德国人民感到自豪的是，他们在争取一个统一、和平和民主的德国和增强唯一的爱好和平的、民主的德意志国家——德意志民主共和国——的斗争中，有着像苏联和中华人民共和国这样的朋友。因此，我们把十月七日德意志民主共和国成立纪念日同时也当作是我们各国人民之间的友好的节日来庆祝，并以兄弟般的感情预祝中华人民共和国政府和伟大的中国人民在社会主义建设、争取实现他们的正义的要求和保卫和平的斗争中继续获得光辉的成就。
