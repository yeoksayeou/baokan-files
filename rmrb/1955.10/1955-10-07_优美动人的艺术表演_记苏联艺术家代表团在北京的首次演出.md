    Beautiful and Moving Artistic Performance
    -- On the First Performance of the Soviet Artists Delegation in Beijing
    Zhang Fei, Tang He
    We watched the first performance of the Soviet Artists Delegation in Beijing with great happiness and excitement. What we will never forget is the outstanding performance of Vera Davydova, the distinguished mezzo-soprano soloist and three-time Stalin Prize winner, and Pavel Lisitsian, the Soviet People's Artist, recipient of the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize, and famous baritone soloist.

    Davydova's tone is soft, beautiful, and simple, with a wide and balanced range; her singing has profound and rich expressiveness. Her singing of "The Third Shepherd's Song" from Rimsky-Korsakov's opera "The Snow Maiden" is so warm and affectionate, and her singing of the "Warrior's Aria" from Tchaikovsky's "Moscow" grand chorus is so simple, restrained, and powerful. Her singing of Russian folk songs and Bizet's "Arabian Song" is so lively and bright. When she sings, she is completely immersed in the musical image created by her singing, and she is sincerely experiencing the inner emotional experience required by an artistic creation. Every listener can feel that Davydova is striving to skillfully use various vocal art techniques to express the ideological content of the song. When she sings, it can be said that she reaches a state of selflessness. Her singing and her eyes are the mirror of her soul, completely expressing everything she wants to express. We are completely confident that when she plays the main characters in many operas, she will definitely be able to create a series of vivid and typical images.

    Amiranashvili's singing is loud, broad, beautiful, pure, and mellow. In the performance, he sang Georgian folk songs, Italian folk songs, the Duke's aria from Verdi's opera "Rigoletto," and the famous aria from Rossini's opera "The Barber of Seville" ("Make way for the city handyman"). His singing is passionate and full of energy, with a distinct style. Whether in the control and use of breath, the changes in timbre, or the fluency of articulation, it can be said that he has reached a state of perfection. His performance was enthusiastically welcomed by the audience. He immediately became the closest and most respected friend of the audience. The more he sang, the more energetic he became, and the more beautiful and magnificent his voice became. He prominently portrayed the inner contradictions of the jester Rigoletto and the optimistic, intelligent, and playful character of the barber Figaro.

    The extraordinary success of Davydova's and Amiranashvili's performances has various profound reasons. They have both undergone rigorous professional training, they both have more than 20 years of singing experience, and they have successfully played dozens of main characters of different personalities, different eras, and different nationalities in classical and modern operas on the stage. This means that they have put in tremendous creative and arduous labor in singing and performing, and they have inherited and carried forward the excellent traditions of Western European and Russian classical masters of vocal art and the rich experience of contemporary actors. They specifically embody the artistic style of the Russian vocal school, are good at making perfect skills subordinate to the creative requirements of artistic thought; are good at revealing the content of works and conveying it to the broad audience; are good at using vivid, moving, simple, powerful, and profoundly sincere emotional singing, and inner experience performance methods to create a great artistic appeal. The valuable experience of these older generation of outstanding artists has successfully cultivated the younger generation of Soviet singers. In this regard, the young singer of the art delegation, international competition winner Le. G. Kostricha, is a vivid example.

    In the performance, Kostricha used his beautiful and elastic baritone voice to sing Soviet modern songs such as "Soldier's Waltz," "Fire Pot," and "Old Soldier's Song," and sang the Chinese folk song "The East is Red" in Chinese. His meticulous expression, clear articulation, dramatic movements, and simple singing style won him enthusiastic applause.

    The "Feodorova Sisters Quintet" is the most moving performance. They sang so vividly. When they sang "The Field is Quiet," the singing seemed to lead people to the night scene of a beautiful field. Their voices are very mellow and harmonious, as clear as a stream and as delicate as light gauze. When they sang "Tractor Driver Nosov-Seryosha," they were so passionate, unrestrained, lively, and happy! They used strong and simple voices to portray the image of working women in collective farms. When they sang "Seagull," they were so relaxed, humorous, and witty, and sighed very humorously at the end.

    Their singing method is based on the polyphonic chorus art inherent in the famous Russian folk music, and has been improved, and the distinct national style has been preserved. This is of infinite benefit to us.

    The acrobatic performances of A. M. Artamonov and M. V. Olkhovskaya reached a high level of artistry. Their performances were so accurate, clean, and beautiful, with a delicate style and varied changes, often beyond what people could imagine. Their performances were very consistent with the musical accompaniment. K. Ye. Bashkevich's piano accompaniment well supported their amazing skills. In particular, when all the lights in the venue were turned off, various colored small lights appeared on the stage, and the different movements of the small lights wove various beautiful patterns. This was processed and created from the ancient acrobatics of "fire sticks," and they changed the fire sticks into electric light sticks. Naturally, after such an improvement, it is much more difficult to perform. On the completely dark stage, when they pass six electric light sticks to each other, it requires very accurate skills and cannot have the slightest difference. The bold innovative creation of these two artists is a new enlightenment for the development of our country's acrobatic art. In addition, it is worth mentioning that from their performances, we also see traces of the exchange and mutual absorption of acrobatics between China and the Soviet Union. The "ball over the head" movement is very similar to the "over the head" movement of China's juggling of jars; the movement of the ball rotating in the circle formed by the two hands and the chest is also the same principle as the "double embrace moon" movement of our country's "long fork".

    The graceful and soft gymnastics performance completely reached a state of perfection. Skvortsova's and Suli's performances were sometimes unbelievably soft, sometimes soaring into the air, although they used a lot of strength, they seemed so "easy"; sometimes they were very thrilling, requiring great courage, but the performance seemed very calm. Skvortsova achieved such amazing results in just five years. How much perseverance and determination did she use to achieve this? The characteristic of her performance is the successful use of ballet movements in gymnastics performance. She balletized soft gymnastics, giving people an extremely beautiful impression.

    The "Russian Competition Dance" performed by six dancers is a joyful, enthusiastic, and highly skilled dance. It skillfully and naturally brings together the essence of Russian dance. Therefore, this dance is particularly rich.

    We are very grateful to the Soviet artists for giving such a good performance for our people, and at the same time gave our art workers a good opportunity to learn.

    优美动人的艺术表演
    ——记苏联艺术家代表团在北京的首次演出
    张非　唐诃
    我们怀着极大的幸福和激动的心情，欣赏了苏联艺术家代表团在北京的首次演出。首先使我们久久不能忘怀的是杰出的女中音独唱家、三次斯大林奖金获得者维·阿·达维多娃和苏联人民演员、列宁勋章和斯大林奖金获得者、著名的男中音独唱家普·维·阿米拉纳什维利的卓越的表演。
    达维多娃的音色柔美、质朴，音域宽广匀称；歌声具有深刻而丰富的表现力。她歌唱李姆斯基—科萨可夫的歌剧“雪娘”中的“牧人第三首歌”是那样热情、亲切，她演唱柴可夫斯基的“莫斯科”大合唱中的“战士咏叹调”，又是那样淳朴、含蓄而有力。她歌唱俄罗斯的民歌和比才的“阿拉伯女人之歌”却又表现得那样活泼明快。她歌唱的时候，完全浸沉在自己的歌声所创造的音乐形象之中，她真诚地在经历着一次艺术创造所要求的心内感情的体验。每一个听众都可以感觉到，达维多娃在表演的时候力图熟练地运用各种声音的艺术技巧去表现歌曲的思想内容。她歌唱的时候，真可以说达到了忘我的境界。她的歌声和她的眼睛就是她心灵的镜子，把她所想表达的一切都完全表现出来了。我们完全相信，当她扮演许多歌剧的主角的时候，她一定可以创造出一系列的鲜明的典型形象。
    阿米拉纳什维利的歌声宏亮宽厚、优美、纯净而圆润。他在表演会上，演唱了格鲁吉亚民歌、意大利民歌、维尔第的歌剧“弄臣”中的弄臣咏叹调和罗西尼的歌剧“塞尔维亚的理发师”中有名的咏叹调（“给城里的杂役让一个位子”）。他的演唱热情充沛，风格鲜明，无论在气息的控制和运用上，音色的变化和口齿的流利上，都可以说达到了炉火纯青的境地。他的演唱，受到了观众的狂热的欢迎。他立刻成为观众最亲密、最敬爱的朋友。他越唱精神也越充沛，声音也越优美而壮丽。他突出地刻划了弄臣黎哥莱脱的内心矛盾和理发师费加洛的乐观、聪敏、俏皮的性格。
    达维多娃和阿米拉纳什维利的演唱所以获得非凡的成功，是有种种深刻的原因的。他们都经历过严格的专业训练，他们都有着二十多年的演唱的经验，他们在舞台上，成功地扮演过古典的和现代的歌剧的几十个不同性格、不同时代、不同民族的主角。这就是说他们在歌唱和表演上，付出了巨大的创造性的刻苦的劳动，他们继承并发扬了西欧和俄罗斯古典大师的声乐艺术的优良传统和同时代的演员的丰富的经验。他们具体地体现了俄罗斯声乐学派的艺术风格，善于使完美的技巧服从于艺术思想的创造要求；善于揭示作品的内容并把它传达给广大的观众；善于用鲜明动人和质朴有力的富有深刻真挚情感的歌声，和内心体验的表演方法去创造巨大的艺术的感染力。他们这些老一辈的卓越的艺术家的宝贵经验，成功地培养了苏联年青一代的歌手。在这方面艺术代表团的青年歌唱家、国际竞赛获奖者勒·格·科斯特里查便是一个生动的例子。
    在表演会上，科斯特里查用他漂亮的富有弹性的男中音演唱了“士兵圆舞曲”、“火壶”、“老兵之歌”等苏联现代歌曲，并用汉语演唱了中国民歌“东方红”。他的细致的表情，清楚的咬字，富有戏剧性的动作和淳朴的演唱作风，使他获得了热烈的喝采。
      “费奥多罗娃姊妹五重唱”是最动人的表演。她们演唱得生动极了。当她们唱“田野静悄悄”时，那歌声真仿佛把人引到了美丽的田野的夜景里。她们的声音非常圆润而谐和，像溪水一样清、像轻纱一样纤细。当她们唱“拖拉机手诺索夫—谢辽沙”时，又是那样热情奔放、活泼愉快！她们用健壮、纯朴的声音刻划了集体农庄劳动妇女的形象。当她们唱“海鸥”时，又是那样的轻松、幽默而诙谐，结尾时非常幽默地叹了口气。
    她们的唱法是在有名的俄罗斯民间所固有的多声部的合唱艺术的基础上，又提高了一步，并且保存了显明的民族风格。这对我们是有无限的教益的。
    阿·麦·阿尔塔莫诺夫和麦·维·奥利霍夫斯卡雅的杂技表演，达到了高度的艺术水平。他们的表演是那样的准确干净而优美，风格细腻，变化多端，往往不是人们所能意想得到的。他们的表演和音乐伴奏十分吻合。克·叶·巴什凯维奇的钢琴伴奏很好地烘托了他们的惊人技艺。特别是全场灯火熄灭时，在舞台上出现了各种彩色的小灯，小灯的不同的运动，织成了各种美丽的图案。这是从古老的杂技“火棒”中加工创造出来的，他俩把火棒改成了电灯棒。自然，这样一改良，耍起来也就难得多了。在全黑的舞台上，当他俩把六个电灯棒互相传递时，需要非常准确的技巧，而不能有毫厘之差。这两位艺术家的大胆革新的创造，对于我国的杂技艺术的发展，是一个新的启示。此外，值得提出的是，从他们的表演中，我们也看出了中苏两国杂技艺术的交流和互相吸取的痕迹。“皮球过顶”的动作和中国的耍坛子的“过顶”的动作极相似；皮球在两手和胸围成的圆圈中旋转的动作，和我国“长叉”的“双抱月”的动作也是一个道理。
    优美的柔软体操表演，完全达到了炉火纯青的境地。斯克沃尔佐娃和绥拉伊的表演，有时软得令人难以置信，有时腾空而起，虽然使用了很大的力量，但又显得那样“轻而易举”；有时非常惊险，需要有很大的胆量，表演却显得很从容。斯克沃尔佐娃只用五年的工夫就达到了这样惊人的成绩，她是用了多么大的坚忍和毅力求得的呵。她的表演的特点，是把巴蕾舞的动作，成功地运用在体操表演上。她把柔软体操舞蹈化了，给人的印象是极为优美的。
    由六位舞蹈家表演的“俄罗斯竞赛舞”是一个欢乐、热情、具有高度技巧的舞蹈。它巧妙而自然地把俄罗斯舞蹈的精华汇集在一起。因此这个舞是特别丰富的。
    我们非常感谢苏联艺术家们为我国人民作了这样好的表演，同时也给了我们的艺术工作者很好的学习机会。
