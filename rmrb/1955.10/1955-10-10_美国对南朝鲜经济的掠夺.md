    American Plunder of the South Korean Economy
    Zhou Xiuqing
    Under the rule of the Syngman Rhee clique, South Korea's economy has suffered severe devastation and destruction. The people's lives are becoming more and more painful, and unemployment, hunger, and bankruptcy threaten everyone. This situation of the South Korean people is the result of the United States' colonial plunder of South Korea and its instruction to the Syngman Rhee clique to desperately expand its military and prepare for war.
    It is well known that American capital has penetrated all the most important economic sectors of South Korea, controlling South Korea's railway and water transportation industries, electrical industries, and mining industries. The "Oriental Consolidated Mining Company" and other monopoly organizations of the American Morgan Group have manipulated the mining rights of tungsten, molybdenum, manganese, and gold in South Korea. According to the materials of the South Korean "Bank of Korea" monthly report, the production of tungsten in South Korea in March 1953 increased by 789% compared with June 1950, gold production increased by 507.9%, and graphite increased by 5,280%. These are all directly mined by American monopoly capital. South Korea's coal production is self-sufficient, but the United States forced South Korea to import American coal at twice the international market price, and forced the anthracite coal from Samcheok and other places in South Korea to Japan at extremely low prices for military industrial use. As a result, South Korea's coal mining industry had to reduce or stop production. Now South Korea's annual coal production is half of what it was during the Japanese rule. The "Special Economic Survey Team" sent by the United States to South Korea stated in its report to Eisenhower without concealment that South Korea's "mineral potential" is "a great source of dollar earning", and suggested that the United States focus on plundering South Korea's mineral resources.
    In order to facilitate the American plunder of South Korea's economy, the Syngman Rhee clique formulated a so-called "constitutional amendment". According to this decree, the Syngman Rhee clique abolished the provisions of "nationalization" of underground resources and "state-owned" important enterprises, and also formulated the "Foreign Investment and Business Law" aimed at ensuring the maximum profits for American capital. According to the South Korean "Chosun Ilbo" revealed in June this year, more than 200 foreign companies controlled by American monopoly capital have entered various economic sectors of South Korea. When these foreign companies transport goods, they do not pay any tariffs under the pretext of transporting property from their own countries. The surplus commodities imported in this way flood the South Korean market. When American companies remit the huge profits they have seized back to the United States, they do not pay income tax in South Korea. Many factories and enterprises in South Korea are affiliated to American capital and have become semi-finished and processed product factories for American raw materials. In this way, South Korea's economy has been completely reduced to a colonial economy dependent on the United States.
    American colonial plunder of South Korea is carried out under the guise of "aid." The aggressive essence of the American "aid" to South Korea is very clear in this year's so-called "aid" plan. 67% of this year's total amount of American "aid" to South Korea is stipulated to be used only for military purposes, to expand the South Korean army and serve the American aggression. Although the United States has publicized that it will use a part of the "aid" in the industrial sector, according to the South Korean Contract News Agency, the initial six months of "aid" showed: "In addition to consumer goods, there is no industrial equipment at all." Syngman Rhee also admitted in the South Korean pseudo-National Assembly on June 22: "Although the United States started saying that it would 'aid the restoration of South Korea' eight or nine years ago, it has not paid attention to the industrial development that can restore the economy, and the construction of South Korea's factory equipment has not started at all." It is not difficult to see that the United States' often-touted "aid to the Korean reconstruction plan" is just a deceptive trick. South Korean magazine "Law and Economy" pointed out: "That gorgeous reconstruction plan is just an illusion, everything is just a pie in the sky."
    In order to seize huge profits and increase the prices of "aid" commodities that are constantly pouring into the South Korean market, the United States artificially raises the price of the dollar. The United States, according to the "Korean-American Military and Economic Assistance Agreement," controls the exchange rate between the US dollar and the South Korean currency (圜), thereby making South Korea's financial finance subordinate to the United States and manipulating South Korea's market prices. Taking the exchange rate change at the end of 1953 as an example, the United States can seize 2.3 billion more 圜 in profits every year just by exporting fertilizer to South Korea. Recently, under the pressure of the United States, the exchange rate between the US dollar and the South Korean currency (圜) has been re-stipulated to be one to five hundred. Compared with the original exchange rate of one US dollar to one hundred and eighty 圜, the South Korean currency has depreciated by nearly two-thirds. The United States forced the Syngman Rhee clique to yield this time by stopping the supply of oil to South Korea and raising the price of US dollars on the black market.
    In order to completely turn South Korea into a colony of the United States, the United States not only dumps surplus materials and plunders resources in South Korea, but also destroys South Korea's original industrial base in every possible way and prevents South Korea from restoring its industry. The United States first destroyed the machinery manufacturing industry, which is the foundation of industrial development. During the Korean War, the United States, under the pretext of "war evacuation," moved the important industrial facilities in the industrial zone between Seoul and Incheon to Japan and Jeju Island. The remaining South Korean industry is on its last breath due to the lack of raw materials and equipment, and is severely hit by American capital and commodity dumping. In Seoul alone, 308 companies went bankrupt in 1954. According to the materials of the South Korean newspaper, in early 1954, the metal industry was only 7.3% of the pre-war level, the chemical industry was only 11.8%, and the food industry was only 19.7%. The current production level of South Korean industry is only 20% of that in 1945.
    The United States is unwilling for South Korea to develop its own industry. Wood, the person in charge of the so-called "economic aid" sent by the United States to South Korea, repeatedly stated: "South Korea is not yet time to establish an industry," and it "should use the funds of the Foreign Operations Administration to import consumer goods." Former South Korean "Prime Minister" Baek Doo-jin also revealed: "The US delegation believes that spending too much money on basic industries will cause inflation, because the result of industrial development will put more money in the pockets of workers." This completely exposes the US lie of so-called "reconstruction" of South Korea.
    The United States also undermines and destroys South Korea's agricultural economy. In 1954, the area of paddy fields in South Korea had been reduced to 75% of that before "August 15th," and the area of dry land had been reduced to 67%. The average annual grain output is only 68% of the pre-war level. Therefore, South Korea now lacks 3 to 4 million seoks of grain every year. Despite this, the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique still transport a large amount of South Korean grain to Japan every year.
    Under this economic situation, the United States still instructs the Syngman Rhee clique to desperately expand its military and prepare for war. In South Korea's 1955 budget, military expenditure accounted for 53.4%, while expenditure for industrial and agricultural production and construction accounted for only 3.6%. The budget deficit reached half, and even with desperate increases in taxes and currency issuance, it was still not enough to make up for it. South Korea currently has more than 280 kinds of miscellaneous taxes and levies. Former South Korean "Prime Minister" Baek Doo-jin also admitted that South Korea's tax revenue is equivalent to 48.9% of the national income, which is "the highest rate of tax in the world."
    Under this colonial plundering policy of the United States, the lives of the South Korean people are becoming more and more difficult. Before February of this year, the number of unemployed people had exceeded 2 million, and the number of semi-unemployed people was more than 11 million. The income of those who have jobs is not enough to maintain their lives. South Korean prices rose 135 times in 1954 compared with 1947. The farmers, who account for 75% of the South Korean population, also live extremely miserably. In the past year, 460,000 farm households ran out of food, and farmers owed an average of about 9,000 圜 per household. The people hate the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique's bone-sucking plunder.
    In order to maintain its colonial plunder of South Korea, and to control South Korea's politics and economy for a long time, the United States is trying to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement in order to achieve its goal of permanently dividing Korea. The South Korean people resolutely oppose this enslavement policy of the United States and are actively fighting for the independence and unification of Korea.

    美国对南朝鲜经济的掠夺
    周修庆
    在李承晚集团的统治下，南朝鲜的经济遭到了严重的摧残和破坏。人民生活越来越痛苦，失业、饥饿和破产威胁着每一个人。南朝鲜人民的这种状况，是美国对南朝鲜实行殖民掠夺并指使李承晚集团拚命扩军备战的结果。
    人所共知，美国资本已经打入了南朝鲜所有最重要的经济部门，控制了南朝鲜的铁路和水上运输业、电气工业和采矿工业等。美国摩根集团的“东方联合采矿公司”等垄断组织，已操纵了南朝鲜钨、钼、锰和黄金等矿业的开采权。据南朝鲜“韩国银行”调查月报的材料，南朝鲜钨的生产，在一九五三年三月就比一九五○年六月增加了百分之七百八十九，金的生产增加了百分之五百零七点九，黑铅增加了百分之五千二百八十。这些都是美国垄断资本直接进行采掘的。南朝鲜煤的生产是能够自给的，但美国以比国际市场高一倍的价格，强迫南朝鲜输入美国的煤，而以极低贱的价格把南朝鲜三陟等地的无烟煤强迫运往日本，供军事工业之用。这样，南朝鲜的煤矿业不得不缩小或停止生产。现在南朝鲜煤的年产量比日本统治时期减少了一半。美国派到南朝鲜去的“经济特别调查团”在给艾森豪威尔的报告中就曾毫不隐讳地说，南朝鲜的“矿物潜在力”是“一个大赚美元的来源”，建议美国着重掠夺南朝鲜的矿产资源。
    为便于美国掠夺南朝鲜的经济，李承晚集团制定了一个所谓“宪法修正案”。根据这个法令，李承晚集团取消了地下资源“国有化”、重要企业“国营”等规定，还制定了旨在保障美国资本获得最大利润的“外国人投资及营业法”。据南朝鲜“朝鲜日报”今年六月透露，已有二百多家美国垄断资本所控制的外国公司打入南朝鲜的各个经济部门。这些外国公司在运进商品时，借口是从本国运进财产而不付分文关税。这样输入的剩余商品充斥南朝鲜市场。美国公司把攫取的巨额利润汇回美国时，也不在南朝鲜付所得税。南朝鲜的许多工厂和企业，隶属于美国的资本，而成为美国原料的半制品和加工品工厂。这样，南朝鲜的经济便完全沦为依赖美国的殖民地经济了。
    美国对南朝鲜的殖民掠夺，是在“援助”的幌子下进行的。美国对南朝鲜“援助”的侵略实质，在今年的所谓“援助”计划中表现得非常清楚。今年度美国对南朝鲜“援助”总额的百分之六十七规定只能用于军事目的，以扩大南朝鲜部队，为美国的侵略服务。虽然美国曾宣传要把一部分“援助”用在工业部门，但据南朝鲜合同通讯社透露最初六个月“援助”的情况说：“输入的物资除了消费品之外，根本没有什么工业器材。”李承晚六月二十二日在南朝鲜伪国会上也承认：“美国虽然从八、九年前开始说要‘援助复兴南朝鲜’，但实际上由于没有注意可以复兴经济的工业发展，南朝鲜的工厂设备的建设至今连一个也没有着手。”这就不难看到，美国所经常吹嘘什么“援助韩国复兴计划”，只是骗人的把戏。南朝鲜“法律与经济”杂志就曾指出：“那华丽的复兴计划，只不过是一个幻想而已，一切都是画饼充饥。”
    为了攫取暴利并提高不断地涌入南朝鲜市场的“援助”商品的价格，美国人为地提高美元的价格。美国根据“韩美军事经济援助协定”，控制了美元和南朝鲜币（圜）的兑换率，从而把南朝鲜的财政金融附属于美国，并操纵南朝鲜的市场物价。单以一九五三年末那次兑换率的变更来说，仅是美国向南朝鲜输出肥料一项，每一年便可攫取比以前多二十三亿圜的暴利。最近，在美国的压力下，美元和南朝鲜币（圜）之间的兑换率已重新规定为一比五百。这和原来的兑换率一美元比一百八十圜比较起来，南朝鲜币又贬值将近三分之二。美国这次改变兑换率是以停止对南朝鲜的石油供应和抬高黑市美元价格的办法迫使李承晚集团就范的。
    为了要把南朝鲜彻底地变成美国的殖民地，美国不仅在南朝鲜倾销剩余物资和掠取资源，并且百般地破坏南朝鲜原有的工业基础，阻止南朝鲜恢复工业。美国首先破坏了作为工业发展基础的机器制造业。在朝鲜战争期间，美国曾以“战争疏散”为名，将汉城到仁川之间工业地带的重要工业设施撤至日本和济州岛。残存的南朝鲜工业因缺乏原料和设备，且受到美国资本和商品倾销的严重打击，已奄奄一息。仅汉城一地，在一九五四年便有三百零八家企业倒闭。据南朝鲜报纸的材料，在一九五四年初，金属工业只相当于战前水平的百分之七点三，化学工业只相当于百分之十一点八，食品工业只相当于百分之十九点七，而现在南朝鲜工业的生产水平，仅相当于一九四五年的百分之二十。
    美国是不愿意南朝鲜发展自己的工业的。美国派赴南朝鲜主持所谓“经济援助”的负责人伍德屡次表示：“南朝鲜还不到能建立工业的时候”，它“应该用援外事务管理署的款项输入消费品”。南朝鲜前“国务总理”白斗镇也曾透露：“美国代表团认为把太多的钱花费在基本工业上会引起通货膨胀，因为工业发展的结果，会使更多的钱落在工人口袋里。”这就彻底地揭穿了美国所谓“重建”南朝鲜的谎言。
    美国对南朝鲜的农业经济也同样加以摧残和破坏。在一九五四年，南朝鲜的水田面积已减为“八·一五”前的百分之七十五，旱田面积减至百分之六十七。粮食平均年产量仅及战前的百分之六十八。因此南朝鲜现在每年缺乏粮食达三、四百万石。尽管如此，美国和李承晚集团每年仍把南朝鲜的大量粮食运往日本。
    在这种经济情况下，美国仍然指使李承晚集团拼命扩军备战。南朝鲜一九五五年度的预算，军费占百分之五十三点四，而用于工农业生产和建设方面的经费仅占百分之三点六。预算的赤字竟达一半，虽然拼命增加税收，发行通货，仍不足以弥补。南朝鲜现有名目繁多的苛捐杂税二百八十多种，南朝鲜前“国务总理”白斗镇也承认，南朝鲜的税收相当于国民所得百分之四十八点九，是“世界最高比率的税金”。
    在美国这种殖民掠夺政策下，南朝鲜人民的生活越来越困苦。在今年二月以前，失业人数便已超过二百万，半失业人数则在一千一百万人以上。有工作的人，收入也不足以维持生活。南朝鲜的物价，在一九五四年比一九四七年上涨了一百三十五倍。占南朝鲜人口百分之七十五的农民，生活也极悲惨。在过去一年中，断粮农户达四十六万户，农民欠债平均每户约九千圜。人民对于美国和李承晚集团这种敲骨吸髓的掠夺，无不恨之入骨。
    美国为了保持它对南朝鲜的殖民掠夺，长期控制南朝鲜的政治和经济，正力图破坏朝鲜停战协定，以实现其永久分裂朝鲜的目的。南朝鲜人民坚决地反对美国这种奴役政策，正积极为争取朝鲜的独立和统一而斗争。
