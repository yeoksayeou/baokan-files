    How to Educate and Help Demobilized Construction Soldiers Returning to the Countryside
    Zhang Liang
    Strengthening the regular education and ideological leadership of demobilized construction soldiers is the demand of the demobilized construction soldiers themselves, and it is also an important task to consolidate the results of resettlement. Demobilized construction soldiers are accustomed to collective life with ideological leadership in the army. Although their way of life has changed after returning to their hometowns, they still hope that the government can regularly educate them and help them continuously improve their awareness so that they can produce and work better.
    According to the experience of Gesanli Township in Chiping County, Caolou Township in Xin County, Yangji Town in Liaocheng County, and Niujiazhuang Township in Ju County, Shandong Province, to do a good job in uniting and educating rural demobilized construction soldiers, we must first correct the understanding of village and township leading cadres on demobilized construction soldiers. Demobilized construction soldiers have generally been tempered and tested by revolutionary wars and have made certain contributions to the revolution. Properly resettling them, uniting them, and helping them do a good job in production and work are the unshirkable responsibilities of village and township cadres. Only from this understanding and perspective can we educate the broad masses and establish a social atmosphere of respecting and caring for demobilized construction soldiers. For example, after the main township cadres of Gesanli Township in Chiping County learned that some cadres had the mentality of looking down on demobilized construction soldiers, and the masses had thoughts such as "they have government care and concern after returning to their hometowns, which has nothing to do with us" and other thoughts of not caring about demobilized construction soldiers, they combined with the central work and conducted self-criticism in various meetings (such as Party branch committees, township people's committees, agricultural production cooperative member meetings, mass meetings, etc.), reviewed their past erroneous thinking of "comparing merits" with demobilized construction soldiers, and on the basis of self-criticism, they further educated the cadres and the masses on remembering the source of water, analyzed and criticized various erroneous thoughts among ordinary cadres and the masses, thus beginning to establish a trend of "taking care of demobilized construction soldiers as an honor" among the broad cadres and the people; the same public opinion also appeared in mutual aid groups and agricultural cooperatives. This has brought closer the relationship between the people and the demobilized construction soldiers and strengthened unity.
    Secondly, cadres should go deep into the villages, understand the various situations and ideological changes of the demobilized construction soldiers after resettlement, and classify them in order to distinguish the types and use good and bad typical examples for commendation and criticism. After returning to their hometowns, the vast majority of demobilized construction soldiers actively demand progress and are willing to do a good job in production and work. However, there are also a few who feel that "participating in agricultural production has no future," are mentally depressed, and have no energy for production and work. Therefore, it is necessary to educate them positively according to different situations. Caolou Township in Xin County and Yangji Town in Liaocheng County have made specific research and analysis on the performance and ideological situation of demobilized construction soldiers in production, work, and other aspects after returning to their hometowns. At the same time, they have ascertained their difficulties in production and life, and solved the difficulties for those who have them. On this basis, they held a symposium and conducted different education according to different situations, pointing out the direction of progress. The effect of doing so is very good, making the demobilized construction soldiers feel at ease in agricultural production.
    Thirdly, education must be combined with solving practical problems in order to achieve good educational results. In each education, if the problems raised by the demobilized construction soldiers belong to the necessary solution of production and living difficulties, they should be solved after the meeting. If they cannot be solved or cannot be solved temporarily, they should be explained or explained in accordance with the spirit of seeking truth from facts. They cannot be ignored or delayed. Only by removing concerns ideologically and solving specific difficulties practically, combining the two, can we truly encourage them to move forward and make them realize the government's concern for them. For example, Caolou Township in Xin County found that Wang Xiacheng and Wang Shuangyi lacked houses, so they supplemented Wang Xiacheng with three public houses and allocated Wang Shuangyi with one thousand bricks to help build houses. Their difficulties were solved, and they became active in production.
    According to Shandong's experience, there are three main ways to strengthen the unity and education of demobilized construction soldiers.
    First, regularly hold symposiums for demobilized construction soldiers at the township level. There are many benefits to doing so: the area is small, and the participants are common; the meeting time is short, and the problems are solved in a concentrated manner, which does not hinder production; the township is a grassroots administrative organization, close to the masses, understands the problems accurately, and helps solve problems more timely and practically. However, the content of such meetings should not be too much or too complicated. In addition to the responsible cadres of the township explaining to them the current major national events and the work arrangements of the entire township, the main thing is to introduce experience and set examples through good typical figures among them; combine with the current production and work situation to make demands on them, call on them to carry out revolutionary heroism competitions to encourage their progress. For example, Yangji Town in Liaocheng County combined with summer production and put forward the "three checks and five comparisons" at the symposium: check plans, check replanting seedlings and thinning seedlings, check wheat field management, compare patriotism, compare mutual assistance and cooperation, compare production, compare technology, compare actions, and the use of production subsidies, called on them to carry out patriotic competitions between villages and villages, between communities and communities, and between people and people, and introduced the model deeds of Xie Lihai, Lu Zixiang and other demobilized construction soldiers in this township who actively participated in production and assisted the township in doing a good job. On the spot, Qiu Zhenhai of Xielou Village, on behalf of six demobilized construction soldiers in the village, challenged the demobilized construction soldiers in Wanglou Village, guaranteeing to do a good job in checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, thinning seedlings, weeding seedlings, and protecting wheat, actively preparing for summer harvesting and summer planting, and helping the newly returned demobilized construction soldiers to participate in mutual aid groups and agricultural cooperatives and other competition conditions. Because the content of the meeting was clear and the requirements were specific, the educational effect was very good. It was unanimously reflected that "such a meeting is good and solves problems. I hope to hold more in the future." Lu Cunxiao, who usually didn't work hard and squandered waste, also found the township cadres after the meeting to review painfully, expressing his determination to correct himself in the future. However, the convening of township-level symposiums must eliminate the prejudices of township cadres and the ideological concerns of being afraid of not being able to hold them well and the more problems that arise. It must be emphasized that they should treat demobilized construction soldiers with a correct attitude, and at the same time, they must be humble and have a spirit of self-criticism, otherwise the meeting will be difficult to hold well.
    Second, regularly absorb demobilized construction soldiers to participate in various work meetings. By doing so, on the one hand, demobilized construction soldiers can deeply understand various policies and laws and understand the situation of various work carried out in the township, so as to lead the masses to do a good job in production and work; on the other hand, the government can also assign tasks to them through meetings, arrange their work, and put forward specific requirements so that they can assist the government, play an active role, and lead the masses to complete various tasks together. For example, because Niujiazhuang Township in Ju County and Gesanli Township in Chiping County often absorb demobilized construction soldiers to participate in various meetings, they have improved the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the demobilized construction soldiers. With the warm welcome and active assistance of cadres and the masses, all thirty-seven demobilized construction soldiers in the two townships have participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and have also actively assisted cadres in doing a good job in the production work of the masses.
    Third, village and township cadres often take the initiative to strengthen contact with demobilized construction soldiers, conduct individual conversations, carry out ideological mutual assistance, care about their difficulties, and exchange opinions on production and work. This is also an important way to enhance mutual unity and understanding and strengthen education. Demobilized construction soldiers have lived in the army for a long time and have received long-term revolutionary education and the practical tempering of revolutionary struggle. In many places, their class consciousness and political understanding are worthy of learning from village and township cadres. However, because they have been away from production for a long time and are not familiar with local work, they cannot figure out anything when they first come back. If village and township cadres can take the initiative to approach them, unite as one, learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses, learn from each other and help each other, understand their difficulties, and help solve them in a timely manner, they can consolidate their production emotions and inspire their enthusiasm for production. After the cadres of Gesanli Township in Chiping County adopted this method to unite and educate the demobilized construction soldiers, all thirteen demobilized construction soldiers in the township were at ease in production. Cao Shangjie, a demobilized construction soldier in the township, did not like to work when he first returned to his hometown and wanted to go out to find a job. Under the education of the township cadres, he also changed his thinking, actively participated in labor, and joined the agricultural production cooperative.

    怎样教育和帮助回到农村的复员建设军人
    张良
    加强对复员建设军人的经常教育和思想领导，是复员建设军人的要求，也是巩固安置成果的重要工作。复员建设军人在部队中习惯了有思想领导的集体生活，他们回乡以后，生活方式虽然有所改变，但仍然希望政府能够经常对他们进行教育，帮助他们不断提高觉悟，以便更好地生产和工作。
    根据山东省茌平县葛三里乡、莘县曹楼乡、聊城县杨集镇和莒县牛家庄乡等地的经验，要做好对农村复员建设军人的团结和教育工作，首先必须端正乡村领导干部对复员建设军人的认识。复员建设军人一般都经过革命战争的锻炼和考验，对革命有一定的贡献，妥善安置他们和团结他们，帮助他们搞好生产和工作，是乡村干部不容推卸的责任。从这种认识和观点出发，才能教育广大群众，树立尊敬和爱护复员建设军人的社会风气。如茌平县葛三里乡主要乡干部在了解到部分干部有瞧不起复员建设军人的情绪，群众中有“他们回乡有政府照顾和关心，与咱无关”等不关心复员建设军人的思想以后，就结合中心工作，通过各种会议（如党支部委员会、乡人民委员会、农业生产合作社社员会、群众会等），检讨了自己过去同复员建设军人“比功”的错误思想，在自我批评的基础上，进而向干部、群众进行了饮水思源的教育，分析批判了在一般干部和群众中的各种错误思想，从而在广大干部和人民群众中开始树立起“以照顾复员建设军人为光荣”的风气；在互助组、农业合作社中，也出现了同样的舆论。这样就密切了人民同复员建设军人的关系，增强了团结。
    其次，干部要深入到村，了解复员建设军人安置后的各种情况及思想变化，进行分类排队，以便分别类型，运用好坏典型事例进行表扬和批评。复员建设军人回乡后，绝大部分是积极要求进步，愿意搞好生产和工作的。但也有少数人感到“参加农业生产没前途”，思想苦闷，生产和工作都没有劲。因此就必须按照不同的情况对他们进行正面的教育。莘县曹楼乡和聊城县杨集镇都对复员建设军人回乡后在生产、工作等方面的表现和思想情况作了具体的研究分析，同时摸清了他们在生产、生活上的困难，对有困难的予以解决，在此基础上又召开了座谈会，针对各种不同情况，进行了不同的教育，指出了前进方向。这样做的效果很好，使复员建设军人在农业生产上安下心来。
    再次，教育必须同解决实际问题相结合，才能收到良好的教育效果。在每次教育中，对复员建设军人提出的问题，如果属于生产生活困难必需解决的，就应在会后给予解决，不能解决或暂时无法解决的，则应根据实事求是的精神进行解释或说明，不能不管，也不能拖延。只有从思想上解除顾虑，从实际上解决具体困难，把两者结合起来，才能真正鼓舞他们前进，使他们体会到政府对他们的关心。例如莘县曹楼乡发现王协成、王双义缺房屋，就补给王协成公房三间，拨给王双义砖一千块协助盖房。他们的困难解决了，在生产上就积极起来。
    根据山东的经验，加强对复员建设军人的团结教育的方式主要有三种。
    第一，以乡为单位，经常召开复员建设军人座谈会。这样做好处很多：如地区小，参加的人普遍；会议的时间短，解决问题集中，不妨碍生产；乡是基层行政组织，接近群众，了解问题确切，帮助解决问题也较及时、实际。但这种会议的内容不宜太多、太复杂，除了由乡的负责干部向他们讲清目前的国家大事和全乡布置工作的情况外，主要是通过他们中间好的典型人物，介绍经验，树立榜样；结合当前生产、工作情况向他们提出要求，号召他们开展革命英雄主义竞赛，以鼓舞他们的前进心。例如聊城县杨集镇结合夏季生产在座谈会上向他们提出了查计划、查补苗间苗、查麦田管理，比爱国、比互助合作、比生产、比技术、比行动和生产补助金的使用情况的“三查五比”，号召他们开展村和村、社和社、人和人之间的爱国主义竞赛，介绍了本乡复员建设军人谢立海、鲁子香等人积极生产、协助乡村做好工作的模范事迹以后，当场就有谢楼庄邱振海代表本村六名复员建设军人向王楼庄的复员建设军人提出挑战，保证做好查苗、补苗、间苗、锄苗、护麦的工作，积极准备夏收夏种、帮助新回乡的复员建设军人参加互助组和农业合作社等竞赛的条件。由于会议内容明确，要求具体，因此教育效果很好，一致反映“这样的会议好，解决问题，希望今后多开”。平日干活劲头不大、挥霍浪费的鲁存孝，会后还找到乡干部痛心检讨，表示今后决心改正。但乡级座谈会的召开，必须解除乡干部的成见和怕开不好、越开问题越多的思想顾虑，强调他们要用正确态度去对待复员建设军人，同时必须虚心、有自我批评的精神，否则会议是很难开好的。
    第二，经常吸收复员建设军人参加各种工作会议。这样做，一方面可以使复员建设军人深刻领会各种政策法令，了解本乡各种工作开展的情况，以便带领群众搞好生产和工作；另方面，政府也可通过会议交代给他们任务，布置他们的工作，并提出具体要求，使他们协助政府，发挥积极作用，带领群众，共同完成各项任务。例如莒县牛家庄乡和茌平县葛三里乡由于经常吸收复员建设军人参加各种会议，提高了复员建设军人的政治积极性和生产积极性，并在干部、群众的热情欢迎、积极协助下，两个乡三十七名复员建设军人全部参加了互助合作组织，而且还积极协助干部做好群众的生产工作。
    第三，乡村干部经常主动地同复员建设军人加强联系，进行个别交谈，开展思想互助，体贴他们的困难，交换生产上和工作上的意见，也是增强彼此间的团结和了解、加强教育的重要方式。复员建设军人经过长时间的部队生活，受过长期的革命教育和革命斗争的实际锻炼，在阶级觉悟和政治认识上有许多地方是值得乡村干部学习的。但由于他们脱离生产较久，地方工作又不熟悉，乍一回来，什么都摸不到头，如果乡村干部能够主动接近他们，团结一致，取长补短，互学互助，了解他们的困难，及时帮助解决，就可以巩固他们的生产情绪，启发他们生产的热情。茌平县葛三里乡干部采用了这种办法对复员建设军人进行团结教育之后，全乡十三名复员建设军人都安心生产。该乡复员建设军人曹尚杰刚回乡时不爱劳动，想出外找工作，在乡干部的教育下也转变了思想，积极参加劳动，并参加了农业生产合作社。
