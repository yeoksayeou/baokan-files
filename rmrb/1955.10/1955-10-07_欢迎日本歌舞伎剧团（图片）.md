    The Japanese Kabuki Troupe, invited to China by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, gave its first performance at the CPPCC Auditorium in Beijing on the evening of the 5th. They performed three Kabuki plays: "Kanjincho," "Keisei Hankan Kou," and "Futari Dōjōji." The performances of these excellent classical plays, rich in Japanese national tradition and unique style, were appreciated and loved by the Beijing audience. The picture above shows the venue of the evening performance. The audience is attentively watching the Japanese Kabuki Troupe's performance of "Kanjincho."　　
    　　            Our reporter Gao Liang and Wang Zhiyuan took the photos.
    The biggest feature of the "Kabuki" stage is the "hanamichi" (flower path) set up between the stage and the audience. The actors enter and exit from here, and sometimes perform in the "hanamichi." The purpose is to increase the three-dimensional sense of the stage scene and shorten the distance between the actors and the audience. The picture above shows the scene where Musashibo Benkei (played by Ennosuke Ichikawa) from the play "Kanjincho" (Subscription List) walks from the "hanamichi" to the stage.

    欢迎日本歌舞伎剧团（图片）
    应中国人民对外文化协会邀请来我国访问的日本歌舞伎剧团，五日晚在北京政协大礼堂举行了首次演出。上演了“劝进帐”、“倾城返魂香”和“双蝶道成寺”三出歌舞伎剧。这些富有日本民族传统和独特风格的优秀古典剧的演出，获得了北京观众的赞赏和喜爱。上图是演出晚会的会场。观众们正聚精会神地观看日本歌舞伎剧团演出的“劝进帐”。　　            本报记者　高　粮　王志渊摄
    “歌舞伎”的舞台最大的特点是舞台与观众席间设有“花道”。演员们由此上下场，有时且在“花道”中表演。目的在增加剧景的立体感，并使演员与观众缩短距离。上图是“劝进帐”（化缘簿）剧中人武藏坊弁庆（市川猿之助扮演）从“花道”上走向舞台的情形。
