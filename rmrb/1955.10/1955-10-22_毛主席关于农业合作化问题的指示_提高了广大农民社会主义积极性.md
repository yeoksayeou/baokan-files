    Xinhua News Agency, October 21st Chairman Mao's Instructions on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperation Increased the Socialist Enthusiasm of the Broad Masses of Peasants

    This newspaper reports that Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperation have increased the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants.

    In Longchang County, Sichuan Province, more than 90% of the peasants heard the relayed report of Chairman Mao. Cheng Congxian, a poor peasant in Tuanjie Township, said, "Chairman Mao's report really spoke to my heart. We want to establish cooperatives like waiting for rain in a great drought. Now we have finally waited for it!" In Ba County, 400,000 peasants, accounting for half of the county's peasants, heard the relayed report. All 2,100 mutual aid groups and over 50,000 peasant households in the county actively applied to establish cooperatives. Peasants in Tongliang County put forward the slogan of doing a good job in production to welcome the establishment of cooperatives. In the 7th district alone, 52 villages accumulated more than 10 million catties of fertilizer. In Yibin County, mutual aid groups have expanded into joint groups, and more than 2,600 joint groups have begun to study the cooperative's charter and documents for establishing cooperatives.

    After seeing the "Resolution on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperation" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao's "Report on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperation," peasants in various parts of Guangdong expressed their sincere support. When the newspapers carrying these two documents arrived in various districts and townships, peasants rushed to buy them, and some spontaneously gathered to read them. In the central Guangdong region, where Chairman Mao's instructions were relayed earlier, peasants have launched a high tide of joining cooperatives. In some advanced districts and townships, the number of peasant households signing up to join the cooperatives has reached 60% to 70% of the total number of peasant households in the districts and townships. For example, in Gangkou District, Zhongshan County, 76% of the peasant households in the district signed up to join the cooperatives, and in other districts, it was around 50%.

    According to statistics from Lin County, Anyang, Jun County, and Tangyin County in Henan Province, 579,200 people have heard the relay of Chairman Mao's instructions. After hearing this, many people actively requested to join the cooperatives or to run the cooperatives well. Peasants in the vegetable gardening area of Tangyin have built 80 cooperative frameworks and collectively planted wheat. Since September, Xinyang Prefecture has vigorously publicized Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation throughout the region, and the peasants' enthusiasm for joining and running cooperatives has been very high. At present, 596 new cooperatives have been established in the region, and 4,483 are being established. By the end of October, 6,673 cooperatives will be established, exceeding the original plan by 2.6 times. After relaying Chairman Mao's instructions in rural areas of Xuchang, Shangqiu and other prefectures, some peasants who were determined to join the cooperatives even mobilized their entire families to come to the cooperatives, expressing their willingness to join.

    After relaying and discussing Chairman Mao's instructions, Liaoning Province formulated a preliminary plan for the agricultural cooperation movement in 1956 based on the principle of "overall planning and strengthening leadership." After preliminary publicity and deliberation, peasants in some areas have begun to take action to prepare for establishing and joining cooperatives. In the fifth district of Xingcheng County, 30 mutual aid groups have requested to establish cooperatives. In Kaiyuan County, 110 mutual aid groups have signed up, and Shahezi Village in the twelfth district has established a cooperative with more than 30 households. In Haicheng County, more than 31,000 peasant households have requested to join the village party branch, village cadres, and old cooperatives, accounting for 70% of the development plan for this winter and next spring.

    As of October 15, in Zhejiang Province, out of the 5,940 townships in the province other than some non-agricultural townships and small towns, 3,703 townships have deeply relayed and publicized Chairman Mao's report, of which 2,365 townships have announced to the masses the overall plan for the development of the agricultural cooperation movement in their townships in light of the specific conditions of their townships. After hearing the relay of Chairman Mao's report, the broad masses of peasants, especially the broad masses of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants, were delighted and actively prepared to establish cooperatives or join old cooperatives. This spring, due to the implementation of the erroneous policy of "resolute contraction" in various parts of Zhejiang, the socialist enthusiasm of rural party members and the masses was frustrated. After relaying and studying Chairman Mao's report, rural party members and cadres in various places generally reflected that: this time their eyes were brightened, the direction was clear, their minds were clear, and they could boldly and freely lead the cooperative movement in a planned manner.

    Many peasants in the suburbs of Beijing said: Chairman Mao is just like he came to our village and saw it with his own eyes. We must follow the path pointed out by Chairman Mao. Now, whether in vegetable areas or large field areas, whether in plains or hilly areas, joining agricultural production cooperatives has become the focus of farmers' conversations. They all regard joining the cooperative first as an honor. The enthusiasm of farmers in the suburbs of Beijing to join cooperatives is even higher, breaking through the development plans of many cooperatives, making district and township cadres have to revise the plan again and again. The Gaobeidian Township Agricultural Production Cooperative originally planned to develop 50 members, but after four revisions, it was decided to develop 200 households. The Shijingshan District also raised the original plan of developing the number of households joining the cooperative to 70% of the total number of households in the district to 75%.

    In many townships in the suburbs of Tianjin, a upsurge of peasants taking the road of cooperation has begun to appear. After some individual farmers in Wanxinzhuang, Dongjiao District, participated in the symposium held by the Changnianqing Agricultural Production Cooperative, they realized the benefits of taking the road of cooperation. Seventy households have applied to join this cooperative. According to incomplete statistics in the southern suburbs, 4,439 peasant households have applied to join the cooperative.

    毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示
    提高了广大农民社会主义积极性
    本报讯　毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示，提高了广大农民的社会主义积极性。
    四川省隆昌县百分之九十以上的农民，听到了毛主席报告的传达，团结乡贫农程从先说：“毛主席的报告真说到我的心上了，我们想办社，像大旱天盼下雨一样，现在可盼到了”。巴县听到传达报告的农民有四十万人，占全县农民的半数。全县两千一百个互助联组五万多农户积极申请办社。铜梁县农民提出搞好生产迎接建社的口号，七区仅五十二个村庄就积肥一千多万斤。宜宾县互助组纷纷扩大成联组，已有两千六百多个联组开始学习社章和办社的文件。
    广东各地农民看到党的七届六中全会“关于农业合作化问题的决议”和毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告后，都欢欣鼓舞地表示真诚拥护。当登载着这两个文件的报纸到达各区各乡时，农民纷纷争购，有的自动集会阅读。传达毛主席指示较早的粤中地区，农民们已掀起了参加合作社的热潮，一些先进区乡报名入社的农户已达区乡农户总数的百分之六、七十。像中山县港口区，报名入社的占全区农户的百分之七十六，其他各区也在百分之五十左右。
    河南省据林县、安阳、濬县、汤阴四个县的统计，有五十七万九千二百人听过毛主席指示的传达。听了以后，很多人都积极要求入社或把社办好。汤阴菜园区农民已搭起八十个社架子，集体种了麦。信阳专区从九月份以来在全区大力宣传了毛主席关于合作化问题的指示，农民入社办社的热情十分高涨。全区目前已建成新社五百九十六个，正在建立的有四千四百八十三个，十月底可建成社六千六百七十三个，将超过原订计划的二点六倍。许昌、商邱等专区的农村在传达毛主席的指示后，有些入社坚决的农民甚至动员全家老少都到社里来，表明入社心愿。
    辽宁省各地传达和讨论了毛主席的指示后，根据“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，制定了一九五六年农业合作化运动的初步规划。各地经过初步宣传酝酿，有些地区农民已开始行动起来，准备建社、入社。兴城县五区现已有三十个互助组要求建社。开原县已有一百一十个互助组报名，十二区沙河子村已建起一个三十多户的合作社。海城县向村支部、村干部、老社要求入社的农户已有三万一千多户，占今冬明春发展计划的百分之七十。
    浙江省截至十月十五日止，全省除部分非农业的乡和小城镇以外，其他的五千九百四十个乡中已有三千七百零三个乡深入地传达和宣传了毛主席的报告，其中二千三百六十五个乡已结合本乡的具体情况向群众宣布了本乡发展农业合作化运动的全面规划。广大农民群众、特别是广大贫农和新、老中农中的下中农，在听了毛主席的报告的传达以后，欢欣鼓舞，积极准备办社或加入老社。今年春季，浙江各地由于执行了“坚决收缩”的错误方针，挫折了农村党员和群众的社会主义积极性，等到传达和学习了毛主席的报告后，各地农村党员和干部普遍反映：这一下眼睛亮了，方向明确了，头脑清醒了，可以大胆放手地有计划地领导合作化运动了。
    北京市郊许多农民说：毛主席真像到了我们村亲眼看了一样。我们一定按照毛主席指的道儿走。现在，无论是在菜区还是大田区，也无论是在平原还是山坡地带，参加农业生产合作社已经成了农民们谈话的中心。他们都以先入社为光荣。北京市郊区农民入社积极性更高，突破了许多社的发展计划，使得区、乡干部不得不一次一次地修改计划。高碑店乡农业生产合作社原来计划发展社员五十户，经过四次修改，确定发展二百户。石景山区也将原来全区把入社农户发展到占农户总数百分之七十的计划提高到百分之七十五。
    天津市郊区农民们走合作化道路的热潮已经在很多乡开始出现。东郊区万辛庄有些单干农民参加了常年青农业生产合作社所召开的座谈会以后，认识到走合作化道路的好处，申请加入这个社的已有七十户。南郊区据不完全统计，申请入社的农民已有四千四百三十九户。
