To Correctly and Reasonably Issue Poverty-Stricken Peasants' Cooperative Fund Loans

To the Editor:

    In the process of issuing poverty-stricken peasants' cooperative fund loans, the Fifth District of Hejian County, Hebei Province, did not grasp the principle of helping poverty-stricken peasants resolve the difficulties of paying fees to join agricultural production cooperatives, thereby consolidating the unity between poverty-stricken peasants and middle peasants. This led to many problems.

    In some villages, when issuing loans, they were not based on actual needs but were distributed evenly or used by the cooperative as public funds. Some even treated the loans as relief funds. For example, in the thirteen cooperatives of Paihuai and Guotun Townships, when allocating loans, the cooperatives were divided into medium and small categories, with medium cooperatives receiving 300 yuan and small cooperatives receiving 150 yuan. There were three methods for using the loans within the cooperatives: First, public loans, public use, and public repayment. For example, the Fanshen Cooperative borrowed 210 yuan in the name of six cooperative members, which was recorded in the cooperative's accounts and used and repaid publicly. The contract was kept in the cooperative, and the members themselves were unaware of it. Second, loans were distributed equally among all members, regardless of whether they were middle peasants or poverty-stricken peasants. For example, the Shunxing Cooperative borrowed 470 yuan in the name of fifteen cooperative members and bought seven privately owned livestock for every twenty-eight members in the whole cooperative, specifically for pulling stone rollers and grinding mills. Third, cooperative leaders treated the loans as relief funds and used them within the cooperative. For example, the Shuguang Cooperative borrowed 118 yuan in the name of four cooperative members and kept it in the cooperative. Accountant Liu Zhenshan said, "Whoever needs money in the future can borrow from it." The Victory Cooperative of Guotun Village borrowed 225 yuan, and the cooperative head, Zhao Wenxiu, distributed it from a position of bestowing favors. He called cooperative member Zhao Shu? in the evening and said, "Knowing you are in difficulty, I got you a loan of forty yuan, is that enough?" Zhao said, "Not enough," so the cooperative head gave him another twenty yuan.

    There were also some cooperative leaders who deceived their superiors and subordinates and fraudulently obtained loans. For example, the Wang Qinghu Cooperative of Xichenggezhuang Village requested a loan of 670 yuan for sixteen households, which was granted by the bank without review by the district or township. As a result, 340 yuan was loaned to seven middle-peasant households that should not have been eligible, and the cooperative head, Wang Qinghu, who was a well-off middle peasant, also received a loan of 60 yuan. Later, Wang Qinghu and others applied for another loan of 144.7 yuan, claiming that five households lacked down payments. In fact, only four households in this cooperative needed a loan of 57.2 yuan.

    In addition, some district and township staff held a purely task-oriented view, did not conduct in-depth investigation and research, and blindly issued loans, resulting in unreasonable use. The Victory Cooperative of Guotun Village borrowed a total of 225 yuan. Apart from 50 yuan used to buy livestock, the remaining 175 yuan was used to repay living loans and debts, buy grain, or for petty expenses. For example, Guo Gengchen used the loan to repay living loans, livestock loans, and other debts, and also bought wheat and piglets. The Ziyuan Cooperative borrowed 100 yuan in the name of two cooperative members and distributed it to nine households. Seven of them used 60 yuan to buy seven piglets, two households used 19 yuan to solve living problems, and the rest was kept by the cooperative for petty expenses.

    All localities should pay attention to inspecting the work of issuing poverty-stricken peasants' cooperative funds and take care to prevent similar deviations.

### 要正确和合理地发放贫农合作基金贷款

    要正确和合理地发放贫农合作基金贷款编辑同志：
    河北省河间县五区在发放贫农合作基金贷款的工作中，没有掌握帮助贫农解决参加农业生产合作社入社费用的困难、从而巩固贫农和中农之间的团结这一原则，以致发生了很多毛病。
    有些乡村在发放贷款的时候，不是根据实际需要，而是平均发放或由社存作公用，有的甚至把贷款当作救济款使用。如徘徊、郭屯两乡共十三个社，分配贷款的时候，将社划分为中、小两类，中社贷给三百元，小社贷给一百五十元。社内使用贷款的办法又有三种：第一种是公贷、公用、公还。如翻身社用六户社员的名义贷款二百一十元，由社内注账，公用、公还，合同在社内存放，社员本人却不知道。第二种是不论中农、贫农社员，平均按人分配。如顺兴社用十五户社员的名义贷款四百七十元，全社每二十八人买一头自留牲畜，共买了七头，专供拉碾推磨用。第三种是社的领导人员把贷款当救济款放在社内使用。如曙光社以四户社员的名义贷款一百一十八元，在社内存着，会计刘振山说：“将来谁缺钱花借谁。”郭屯村胜利社贷款二百二十五元，社长赵文秀用恩赐观点来进行分配。他晚上把社员赵树?叫去说：“知道你困难，给你贷了四十元，够花吗？”赵说“不够”，社长就又给了二十元。
    还有一些社的领导人员欺上瞒下，骗取贷款。如西程各庄村王清浒社十六户提出要贷款六百七十元，没有经过区、乡审查，就在银行营业所照数贷到了。结果其中七户不应该贷款的中农就贷了三百四十元，社长王清浒是富裕中农，也贷了六十元。此后，王清浒等又用有五户缺底垫为理由再申请贷款一百四十四元七角。事实上，这个社只有四户需要贷款五十七元二角。
    另外有一些区乡工作人员存在着单纯任务观点，不作深入的调查研究，盲目发放贷款，以致发生使用不合理的现象。郭屯村胜利社共贷款二百二十五元，除买牲口用去五十元外，其余一百七十五元，有的归还了生活贷款和债务，有的买了粮食有的零花了。如郭庚辰就把贷款用来归还生活贷款、牲口款和其他债务，还买了小麦和小猪。自愿社用两户社员的名义贷款一百元，分给了九户，其中七户用六十元买了七个小猪，有两户用十九元解决了生活问题，其余的由社内留下作为零花用。
    各地应当注意检查发放贫农合作基金的工作，注意防止类似的偏差。
