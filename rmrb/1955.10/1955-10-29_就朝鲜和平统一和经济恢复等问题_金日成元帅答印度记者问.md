Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, October 28th. The Korean Central Broadcasting Station in Pyongyang broadcast on the 27th the written replies of Marshal Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to questions raised by B.B. Prasard, an Indian journalist representing several Indian newspapers.

In replying to the question about the policy and method of realizing the reunification of Korea, Kim Il-sung said that the unification of Korea must be peacefully resolved by the Korean people themselves. This means that Korea should establish a unified central government based on free elections in both North and South Korea based on the freely expressed will of the people of both North and South Korea. The nature of the state system should also be determined according to the will of the Korean people, and the method of one party imposing on the other should be rejected.

In order to achieve this goal, the path for contact between North and South Korea should first be opened, North and South Korea should conduct consultations and make joint efforts, freedom of political activity should be granted to the broad masses of the people, all foreign troops should be withdrawn from the entire territory of Korea as soon as possible, the armed forces of North and South Korea should be reduced to a minimum, and the Korean armistice should be stabilized and transformed into a solid peace.

As the Indian government supports, the Korean people hope that an Far East conference with the broad participation of Asian countries will be convened by the countries concerned at an early date, and the Korean issue will be discussed at this conference; and believe that it is necessary for the countries concerned about the Korean issue to make efforts for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to assume obligations to ensure peace in Korea.

Kim Il-sung then replied to the question about the progress of Korean reconstruction. He said that the 1954-56 Three-Year Plan for the recovery and development of the national economy is being successfully implemented. The goal of this plan is to restore the main sectors of the national economy to pre-war levels within these three years. Generally speaking, this three-year plan will be completed or overfulfilled ahead of schedule.

Kim Il-sung pointed out that the important factors guaranteeing the success of the Korean recovery cause are: first, due to the Korean people's display of noble patriotic enthusiasm in the recovery and construction cause, and Korea has abundant natural resources; second, due to the selfless great assistance from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and Hungary and many other friendly countries.

In replying to the question about the plan for Korean industrialization, Kim Il-sung said that the three-year plan is a preparatory work for laying the foundation for Korea's future industrialization. It is estimated that the foundation for industrialization can be completed during the five-year plan implemented from 1957.

Kim Il-sung finally said that the Korean people are extremely satisfied with India's implementation of a peace-loving foreign policy based on the well-known Five Principles, especially the great concern and continuous efforts made by the Indian government for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. At the same time, I would like to express my friendly regards to the peace-loving Indian people.

    就朝鲜和平统一和经济恢复等问题
    金日成元帅答印度记者问
    新华社平壤二十八日电　平壤朝鲜中央广播电台在二十七日广播了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成元帅对代表几家印度报纸的印度记者布·布·普拉萨德所提问题的书面答复。
    在答复关于实现朝鲜统一的方针和方法的问题时，金日成说，朝鲜的统一必须由朝鲜人民自己和平地解决。这就是说，朝鲜应当根据以南北朝鲜人民所表示的自由意愿为基础的南北普选，成立统一的中央政府，国家制度的性质也应根据朝鲜人民的意志来决定，而应当排斥一方强加于另一方的方式。
    为了达到这个目的，首先应当开辟南北朝鲜之间进行接触的道路，由南北朝鲜进行协商和共同努力，给予广大的人民群众以政治活动的自由，一切外国军队迅速从全朝鲜地域撤出，把南北朝鲜的武装力量缩减到最小限度，稳定朝鲜的停战并使之转变成巩固的和平。
    如同印度政府所支持的一样，朝鲜人民希望由有关国家早日召开有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议，并在这个会议上讨论朝鲜问题；并且认为关心朝鲜问题的有关国家有必要为朝鲜问题的和平解决进行努力，对保障朝鲜的和平承担义务。
    金日成接着答复了关于朝鲜恢复建设的进行情形的问题。他说，一九五四——五六年人民经济恢复发展三年计划正在成功地实现着。这个计划的目标是要在这三年内把人民经济重要部门恢复到战前水平。总的说来，这个三年计划将提前完成或超额完成。
    金日成指出，保障朝鲜的恢复事业取得这样的成果的重要因素是：第一，由于朝鲜人民在恢复建设事业中发挥了崇高的爱国主义的热忱，并且朝鲜有着丰富的自然资源；第二，由于有着来自苏联、中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利和其他许多友好国家无私的莫大援助。
    金日成在答复了关于朝鲜工业化的计划问题时说，三年计划是为奠定朝鲜将来的工业化基础而进行的准备工作，估计在从一九五七年起实行的五年计划的期间内，可以完成工业化的基础。
    金日成最后说，朝鲜人民对于印度实行以世所周知的五项原则为基础的爱好和平的对外政策，特别是印度政府为朝鲜问题的和平解决所给予的很大关心和所进行的不断努力，感到极大的满意。同时，谨向爱好和平的印度人民表示友谊之忱。
