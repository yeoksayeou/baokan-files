To the Editor:

In some areas of Hunan Province, maritime accidents in water transportation are very serious. For example, from January to July 15 this year, the Shaoyang Port experienced 80 maritime accidents, with a total loss of goods valued at over 34,000 yuan, including a loss of more than 316,000 jin of grain. In the Anjiang area, there were 18 maritime accidents in the first quarter of this year, resulting in a loss of more than 120,000 jin of grain. In the Hengyang area, there were four maritime accidents in May alone, resulting in a loss of more than 13,600 jin of grain. On August 18 this year, Zhou Jiasheng, a boatman from Xiangtan Port, was transporting public grain from Yapotang in Xiangyin to Changsha when his boat capsized at Hongduzhou upstream from Jinggang, resulting in a loss of more than 28,950 jin of rice. This frequent and serious occurrence of maritime accidents causes undue losses to state property and affects the smooth completion of inland river transportation tasks, which is a problem worthy of attention.

Currently, it is the season for autumn grain transfer, and the task of inland river transportation is very heavy. Therefore, preventing maritime accidents and ensuring transportation safety have become an urgent task. However, we have recently discovered that many consigning units, in order to blindly rush tasks, are randomly hiring boats without going through the shipping management department. For example, grain purchasing points in Pengjiawan, Zhoujiaba, and Qiaokou in the Dazhong District of Wangcheng County have all intercepted passing boats to load their goods, and even the boats sent by the Xinkang District of Wangcheng County to Shimatou to transport grain have been intercepted by them. This practice not only disrupts transportation order, preventing the shipping management department from accurately grasping the transportation plan; more seriously, some of the boats hired are of poor quality, and in some cases, people have to bail out the water leaking into the cabin during transportation. The skills of some boatmen are also questionable, which seriously affects transportation safety and increases the possibility of accidents.

Of course, to prevent maritime accidents in inland river transportation, it is more important to rely on the shipping management department to pay attention to safety transportation and strengthen safety education for boatmen. Therefore, I hope that the inland river shipping management departments and consigning units in various places will pay attention to this issue to prevent water transport accidents.

### 湖南省某些地区水上运输事故严重

    湖南省某些地区水上运输事故严重编辑同志：
    湖南省有些地区水上运输中的海损事故非常严重。例如，邵阳港从今年一月到七月十五日先后发生八十次海损事故，损失的物资价值共计人民币三万四千多元，其中粮食的损失有三十一万六千多斤。安江地区今年第一季度发生了十八次海损事故，损失粮食十二万多斤。衡阳地区仅今年五月份就发生了四次海损事故，损失粮食一万三千六百多斤。今年八月十八日，湘潭港的船户周嘉生从湘阴鸭婆塘承运公家的粮食到长沙，船在靖港上游洪都洲翻掉了，损失稻谷二万八千九百五十多斤。这种海损事故频繁的严重情况，使国家财产受到不应有的损失，同时影响了内河运输任务的顺利完成，是一个值得注意的问题。
    目前，正是秋粮调运的季节，内河运输任务很重，因此，防止海损事故，确保运输安全，更成为一件迫切的工作。但是，我们最近却发现不少托运单位为了盲目赶任务，不通过航运管理部门就乱拉船只，例如望城县大众区彭家湾、周家坝和乔口等粮食收购点都曾经拦截过路船只为他们装货，甚至连望城县新康区派往石码头装运粮食的船只也被他们拦住了。这种做法，不仅打乱了运输秩序，使航运管理部门不能准确地掌握运输计划；而更严重的是，由于拉来的船只有的质量不好，个别的船只甚至在运输途中必须有人排除漏进船舱的水，有些船工的技术也成问题，因而严重地影响了运输安全，增加了发生事故的可能性。
    当然，要防止内河运输中海损事故，更主要的要依靠航运管理部门重视安全运输工作，加强对船民的安全教育。因此，我希望各地内河航运管理部门和托运单位共同注意这个问题，防止水上运输事故。
