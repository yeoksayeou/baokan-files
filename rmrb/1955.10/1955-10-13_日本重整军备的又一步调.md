Japan's Further Step in Rearmament
Jiang Yuanchun

Since the Japan-U.S. talks, there have been increasing signs that the pace of reviving Japanese militarism is accelerating. The large-scale military exercises of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force, which started on the 10th in Hokkaido, are another demonstration of the Japanese government's active rearmament.

Although the Japanese Constitution prohibits Japan from rearming, the so-called "Self-Defense Forces" of Japan have long ceased to be an army genuinely established for self-defense purposes. This army is being actively expanded under the support and assistance of the United States, in accordance with the strategic plans of the United States. According to a recent report by Kyodo News, according to the plan of the Japanese "Defense Agency," Japan will have 285,000 troops in the Army, Navy, and Air Force by 1961. If the 100,000-strong "National Guard" that the Japanese government plans to establish is included, the total number will approach 390,000. This actually exceeds the 350,000 demanded by the United States. To this end, the annual military expenditure from the 1961 fiscal year will increase to about two and a half times the current military budget, reaching a huge amount of 215.2 billion yen. According to the results of the Japan-U.S. talks, this huge army will be sent abroad to "contribute" to the U.S. aggression in the Western Pacific, which completely exposes the signboard of "Self-Defense Forces" hung by this army.

The Japanese people and patriotic forces of all strata in Japan are fully opposed to the revival of Japanese militarism and the results of the Japan-U.S. talks. The left and right wings of the Japanese Socialist Party have decided to demand an explanation of the results of the Japan-U.S. talks. At such a time, the Japanese government openly trumpets and conducts this large-scale military exercise, the purpose of which is obviously to incite the war frenzy of militarist elements and force the Japanese people and the broad patriotic forces of Japan to recognize that rearmament and the restoration of Japanese militarism are accomplished facts. This action is actually a provocation against the Japanese people and all forces in Japan that oppose the revival of Japanese militarism.

Japan is China's close neighbor. The Chinese people, like the Japanese people, have always advocated the normalization of relations between China and Japan and the development of normal trade relations between the two countries. The Chinese government has expressed its willingness to negotiate with the Japanese government on these and other issues. However, the Japanese government pretends to be deaf and dumb to China's goodwill. On the other hand, it is actively following the United States in reorganizing its aggressive armed forces, allowing the United States to train Chiang Kai-shek's military personnel in Japan, and holding large-scale military exercises to promote militarism, with the participation of the U.S. Air Force. The Chinese people have the right to know whether the Japanese government is treating China as its hypothetical enemy.

The participation of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Japan in the exercise and the attendance of the U.S. "Military Assistance Advisory Group" stationed in Japan for "observation" are concrete manifestations of the United States incorporating Japan into its strategic plan. This also shows that after the Japan-U.S. talks, the U.S. control over Japan has been further strengthened, Japan's independence and autonomy have been further harmed, and the threat to the safety of the Japanese people has become increasingly serious. Under the military control and strategic arrangements of the United States, the Japanese government seems to be leading Japan down an extremely dangerous path, which is not only intolerable to the Japanese people, but also intolerable to the people of all Asia.

    日本重整军备的又一步调
    蒋元椿
    在日美会谈以后，有越来越多的迹象表明复活日本军国主义的步调正在加紧。从十日起在北海道举行的日本陆、海、空军的战后最大规模的作战演习，就是日本政府积极重整军备的又一个表现。
    虽然日本宪法规定禁止日本重整军备，但是，日本的所谓“自卫队”早就不是一支真正为了自卫目的而建立的军队。这支军队正在美国的支持和援助之下，按照美国的战略计划积极扩充。据共同社最近报道，按照日本“防卫厅”的计划，日本到一九六一年将拥有陆、海、空军二十八万五千人。如果把日本政府计划建立的十万人的“国民兵”计算在内，总数将接近到三十九万人。这实际上超过了美国所要求的三十五万人的数目。为此，从一九六一年度起的每年军事费用将增加为现在的军事预算的两倍半左右，达到二千一百五十二亿日元的巨额。根据日美会谈的结果，这支庞大的军队将被派到国外去对美国在西太平洋的侵略“作出贡献”，这就彻底揭穿了这支军队所挂的“自卫队”的招牌。
    日本人民和日本各阶层爱国力量全力反对日本军国主义复活，反对日美会谈的结果。日本左右两派社会党曾经决定要对日美会谈的结果提出要求解释。在这样的时候，日本政府公然大吹大擂，来进行这次大规模的作战演习，其目的显然是想煽动军国主义分子们的战争狂热，并迫使日本人民和日本广泛的爱国力量承认重整军备、恢复日本军国主义是既成的事实。这个行动实际上是对日本人民和日本一切反对复活日本军国主义的力量的挑衅。
    日本是中国的紧邻，中国人民和日本人民一样，一向主张中日两国关系正常化，主张发展两国的正常贸易关系，中国政府曾经表示准备就这些问题以及其他问题同日本政府进行谈判。但是日本政府对中国的善意表示，假作痴聋。而另一方面，它却积极追随美国重整侵略武装，容许美国在日本训练蒋贼军事人员，举行宣扬军国主义的大规模作战演习，而且有美国的空军参加。中国人民有权利要求了解，日本政府是不是正在把中国当成它的假想敌国。
    美国驻日本的空军参加演习，美国驻日本的“军事援助顾问团”也出席“参观”。这是美国把日本纳入它的战略计划的具体表现。这也说明在日美会谈以后，美国对日本的控制更为加强，日本的独立自主已经受到了进一步的危害，日本人民的安全所受的威胁已经是越来越严重。在美国的军事控制和战略安排之下，日本政府似乎正在使日本走向一条极其危险的道路，这条道路不但是日本人民不能容许的，也是全亚洲人民所不能容许的。
