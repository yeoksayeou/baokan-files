    A Medical Team on the Grasslands of Xinjiang
    Du Baozhu
    On the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, the Imanbai Grassland beside the Tash River, a tributary of the Manas River, is lush with water and grass, and teeming with cattle and sheep. It is a summer pasture beloved by the herders.

    Across the vast grassland, tents are pitched in twos and threes. What particularly draws the attention of the herders are two white tents, set off by the bulrush-like green grass, with red cross flags fluttering atop them.

    The herders are well aware that this is the medical team sent by Chairman Mao, and it is not their first visit.

    Led by the old herder Amai Tuo, groups of warm and sincere Kazakh men, women, and children come to visit their new neighbors.

    The medical team consists mostly of young Han comrades, who are busy organizing their work environment. Language barriers cannot hinder the exchange of feelings, especially since some of them are already acquainted! The old herder Amai Tuo tightly embraces Dr. Wang, who had visited last year, his sincere eyes revealing heartfelt gratitude. It was this Dr. Wang who, last year, stayed up many nights to save Amai Tuo's life when he was in critical condition. A crisp "Comrade! Hello!" rings out, and everyone sees a Han girl running over. Isn't this the little "Kos" (affectionate term for girl) who came last year? Nulina, a Kazakh woman in the crowd, holding her healthy one-year-old child, walks towards the girl who delivered her baby last year.

    It turns out that the fruits of labor are so pleasant. The herders' visits and the affectionate feelings they bring deeply educate the comrades of the medical team.

    Only by working hard can we live up to Chairman Mao's trust. Only through diligent labor can we live up to the expectations of our fraternal nationalities.

    Intense work begins. Every day at sunrise, comrades from the medical team's mobile unit set off on horseback to work in the scattered tents of the herders. The mobile unit carries simple first-aid kits to vaccinate the herders, administer inoculations, carry out health education, and provide general treatment. Their destination is remote mountain gullies. The vastness of the pastoral areas means that they spend most of the day on horseback, traveling from one mountain to another. When hungry, they take out dry rations to satisfy their hunger; when faced with storms, they continue to move forward.

    The medical team's sincere service to the herders enables the fraternal nationalities to deeply appreciate that only in the era of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao will there be doctors who come to their doorsteps in the remote mountain gullies.

    This medical team is the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Anti-Epidemic Medical Team, established in 1951. It consists of more than 80 staff members from Uygur, Han, Hui, Mongolian, Kazakh, Russian, and other ethnic groups, who come from Shanghai, Nanjing, the Northwest, the Northeast, and all parts of Xinjiang. For the past four or five years, they have been fighting infectious diseases that endanger the health of people of all ethnic groups, traveling throughout the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. They have gone south to Hotan at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, and north to Ili, Tacheng, and Altay. They have provided free treatment to farmers and herders approximately 100,000 times, vaccinated over 1 million people, administered various preventive injections approximately 800,000 times, and trained approximately 500 health workers and midwives in various locations who do not leave production.

    Wherever they go, they establish deep feelings with the local people of all ethnic groups, and receive assistance and support from the masses. The villagers actively help them solve their food problems, and some old ladies and old men treat them like their own children.

    Through practical work, the medical team's staff have become very accustomed to marching in the snowy darkness and riding horses and climbing mountains in the desert grasslands. They feel very honored to be able to serve the frontier of the motherland and help the fraternal nationalities in their construction.

    Under the education of the Party and through practical training, the minority ethnic cadres in the medical team have improved significantly in terms of politics, culture, and professional competence. For example, Da Rouzi of the Uygur ethnic group used to be a soldier. After participating in anti-epidemic training classes and working for four years, his cultural level has improved to the junior high school level, and he is able to independently undertake general medical and organizational work. Another example is Basheng of the Mongolian ethnic group, who used to be a hired laborer and semi-illiterate, and is now able to undertake general work.

    新疆草原上的一支医疗队
    杜宝珠
    天山北麓，玛纳斯河流支脉塔什河旁的伊满白草原，水草丰茂，牛羊成群，这是牧民们所喜爱的夏窝子。
    辽阔的草原上，三三两两的帐篷建立起来了。特别引起牧民们注意的，是被水葱一般的青草相衬托着的两顶白帐篷，红十字的旗帜插在帐篷顶上迎风飘扬。
    牧民们十分清楚，这是毛主席派来的医疗队，它已经不是第一次来了。
    热情纯厚的哈萨克男女老少，由老牧民阿买脱带领着成群地来拜访新来的邻居。
    医疗队里年青的汉族同志占多数，他们正在忙碌地整理自己的工作环境。语言不通，阻隔不了感情的交流，更何况其中还有些是认识的呢！老牧民阿买脱一把紧紧地抱住了去年来过的王医生，热诚的眼光，流露出衷心的感谢。就是这个王医生，去年曾经数夜不眠，救活了阿买脱垂危的生命。一声清脆的“同志！你好！”的声音，大家看到了一位跑来的汉族姑娘，这不是去年来过的小“扣斯”（姑娘的爱称）吗？人群中的哈族妇女奴里娜，抱着她健壮的一周岁的孩子，走向去年为她接生的姑娘跟前。
    原来劳动的结果是这样的愉快，牧民们的来访和带来的亲切的感情，深深地教育了医疗队的同志们。
    唯有努力工作，才能对得起毛主席的委托。唯有辛勤劳动，才能对得起兄弟民族的期望。
    紧张的工作开始了。每当旭日初升的时候，医疗队巡回组的同志就骑马出发到分散的牧民居住的帐篷去工作了。巡回组携带着简单的小药箱，去为牧民们种牛痘、打预防针，并作卫生宣传和一般治疗。他们的目的地是偏僻的深山沟。牧区的辽远，使他们一天绝大部分时间都在马上，从这个山头到那个山头。肚子饿了，拿出干饷充饥；暴风骤雨来了，照样前进。
    医疗队的同志们热诚为牧民服务，使兄弟民族深切地体会到：只有在共产党、毛主席的年代里，深山沟中才会有走上门来的医生。
    这个医疗队就是新疆维吾尔自治区防疫医疗队，它成立于一九五一年，有维吾尔、汉、回、蒙、哈萨克、俄罗斯等族的工作人员八十多人，他们来自上海、南京、西北、东北以及全疆各地。四五年来，他们同危害各族人民健康的传染病作斗争，奔驰在天山南北各地。他们往南到过昆仑山脉下的和阗，往北到过伊犁、塔城、阿山等地，他们为农牧民免费治疗了约十万次，种痘约一百多万次，各种预防注射约八十多万次，并在各地培养了不脱离生产的卫生干事、接生员约五百多人。
    他们每到一处，同当地的各族人民就建立了深厚的感情，得到了群众的援助和支持。老乡们主动地帮助他们解决吃食问题，有的老大娘、老大爷把他们当作自己的孩子一样。
    在实际工作的锻炼中，医疗队的工作人员已经非常习惯在冰天雪地的黑夜里行军和在沙漠草原上骑马爬山。他们感到能够为祖国边疆服务，帮助兄弟民族建设，非常光荣。
    医疗队的少数民族干部在党的教育下和实际锻炼中，不论在政治、文化上和业务能力上，都提高了不少。如维吾尔族的大肉孜，解放前是打饷的，参加防疫员训练班学习和工作四年后，文化水平已提高到初中程度，并能单独担负一般医疗和组织工作。又如蒙古族的巴生，过去是雇工，半文盲，现在也能担负一般工作了。
