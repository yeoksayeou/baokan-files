    Eleventh Anniversary of the Liberation of Belgrade
    Gao Ji
    Today marks the eleventh anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, from the occupation of German fascist forces. The liberation of Belgrade was a glorious victory for the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army and the Soviet Army in their joint fight against fascism. Therefore, this day is not only an important page in the history of the Yugoslav people's rebirth in the anti-fascist war, but also an important symbol of the traditional combat friendship cemented with blood by the people of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.
    In April 1941, fascist Germany launched a perfidious attack on Yugoslavia and occupied the country. Under the occupation of fascist Germany and its vassal troops, the Yugoslav people experienced the most terrible years of their lives. Under the leadership of the Yugoslav Communist Party and Marshal Tito, the Yugoslav people launched a heroic guerrilla war against the occupiers. The Yugoslav people's struggle against the enemy developed to a very strong scale and established the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army. By 1944, the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army was a powerful army of 300,000 men, resisting 600,000 German fascist occupation troops and their vassal troops, and liberating large tracts of territory in three years of heroic fighting, killing and wounding 300,000 enemy troops. The Yugoslav People's Liberation Army made significant contributions in the war against fascism and for the liberation of Yugoslavia. The freedom-loving people of all countries, especially the Soviet people, expressed warm sympathy and concern for the heroic struggle waged by the Yugoslav people; the Soviet Union did everything in its power to assist the patriotic Yugoslav patriots.
    The continuous victories of the Soviet army over the German fascist army in the Great Patriotic War were a powerful support and a great encouragement to the Yugoslav people in their arduous struggle. In 1944, the Soviet army inflicted ten annihilating blows on the German aggressors, completely clearing the German aggressor troops from Soviet territory and continuing to pursue the enemy beyond the Soviet border. As a result of the Soviet army's continuous and victorious pursuit of the enemy outside its borders in August, September and October of that year, Romania and Bulgaria were liberated from the oppression of German fascism, and the Soviet army also entered Hungary. This fundamentally changed the situation in the Balkans and greatly facilitated the Yugoslav people's struggle against the enemy. On September 6 of that year, the Soviet army reached the border between Romania and Yugoslavia. Marshal Tito said in his order to the personnel of the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army: "The day of great joy that you and the tens of thousands of martyred heroes have been waiting for during the three and a half years of the most serious test has arrived. On September 6, our great ally—the glorious Red Army—has arrived at the Yugoslav border." He called on the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army personnel to mercilessly strike the enemy and annihilate the enemy's manpower. Under the encouragement of this victory, the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army liberated 98 cities and towns and killed and captured more than 35,000 enemy troops in the operations in early September alone.
    In this situation, the Soviet Union directly aided the Yugoslav people with its armed forces. The Soviet Ukrainian Third Front Army, after clearing the enemy forces in southern Romania and Bulgaria, crossed the border between the two countries at the end of September, entered Yugoslavia, and joined forces with the troops of the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army west of Negotin on October 4. The Yugoslav people, like other European peoples who had suffered under fascist tyranny, greeted the Soviet army with joy. The Soviet army and the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army crushed the enemy's resistance and surrounded Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, in mid-October. Under the city of Belgrade, the soldiers of the Soviet army and the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army went through five days and nights of raids and finally jointly liberated this ancient Slavic city from the hands of the Hitlerite occupiers on October 20. The battle fought by the Soviet and Yugoslav soldiers for the liberation of Belgrade further consolidated the fraternal friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Marshal Tito, commander of the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army, said in a telegram to Stalin, Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army, after the liberation of Belgrade: "The liberation of Belgrade is of historic significance to our people, because in Yugoslavia, in this land where the people have suffered for a long time, the great Soviet children and the Yugoslav children shed blood together. The fraternal friendship between the Yugoslav people and the Soviet people has been strengthened once again."
    In the joint operations, the Soviet army and the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army also liberated many other cities in Yugoslavia, cleared the enemy occupying the northeastern regions of Yugoslavia, and, while pursuing the enemy on Hungarian territory, cut off the remaining Hitlerite troops in Yugoslavia. The brave Yugoslav People's Liberation Army soldiers led by Marshal Tito, with the assistance of Soviet weapons, cleared these remnants, thereby completing the national liberation of Yugoslavia.
    The friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, consolidated during the war years, has developed well in the post-war years, and the closest and most friendly relations have been formed between them. After the war, the Yugoslav working people overthrew the rule of the dynasty, established a People's Democratic Republic, and carried out profound democratic reforms in domestic political and economic life, thereby breaking free from the shackles and oppression of capitalism. The establishment of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and the series of political and economic democratic reforms it carried out were warmly cherished and fully supported by the Soviet people and all socialist camp countries. The Soviet Union also provided selfless and enormous assistance to the Yugoslav people in the first few years after the war. Unfortunately, at the end of 1948, due to the sabotage of the enemies of peace and socialism, a rift occurred in the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The imperialist aggressor bloc had attempted to exploit this situation to create hostility and hatred between the two countries, so as to make the Balkans a "powder keg" of Europe again. But their hope was dashed. Thanks to the continuous measures taken by the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in recent years to normalize relations between the two countries, especially the results of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks held at the end of May and the beginning of June this year, a solid foundation for developing friendly relations and all-round cooperation between the two countries has been re-established. Now, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are developing and consolidating day by day. This is not only of great significance for strengthening the traditional combat friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, but also a major contribution to consolidating European peace and easing international tensions.
    The normalization of Soviet-Yugoslav relations has opened the way for restoring and developing Yugoslavia's friendly relations with other countries in the socialist camp. The People's Republic of China has established formal diplomatic relations with the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, which provides good conditions for promoting friendship between the two peoples and developing economic and cultural ties between them. The Chinese people have always cherished friendly feelings towards the Yugoslav people, and have high respect for their heroic spirit in the struggle against fascism and for national independence and freedom. We believe that, due to the common aspirations of the people of China and Yugoslavia, the friendship between the two peoples will continue to develop and consolidate.

    贝尔格莱德解放十一周年
    高集
    今天，是南斯拉夫首都贝尔格莱德从德国法西斯军队的侵占下获得解放的十一周年。贝尔格莱德的解放是南斯拉夫人民解放军和苏联军队在反法西斯战争中共同作战的辉煌胜利。因此，这个日子不仅是南斯拉夫人民在反法西斯战争中获得新生的历史的重要的一页，并且也是苏南两国人民用鲜血凝成的、传统的战斗友谊的重要标志。
    一九四一年四月，法西斯德国对南斯拉夫发动了背信弃义的进攻，并占领了这个国家。在法西斯德国及其附庸军队的占领下，南斯拉夫人民经过了他们生活上最可怕的年头。南斯拉夫人民在南斯拉夫共产党和铁托元帅的领导下，对占领者展开了英勇的游击战争。南斯拉夫人民的对敌斗争，曾发展到十分强大的规模，并建立了南斯拉夫人民解放军。至一九四四年，南斯拉夫人民解放军已是一支拥有三十万人的强大军队，抗击了六十万人的法西斯德国占领军及其附庸军队，并在三年的英勇战斗中解放了大片的国土，毙伤敌军三十万人。南斯拉夫人民解放军在反对法西斯和解放南斯拉夫的战争中建立了重大的功绩。各国爱好自由的人民，首先是苏联人民，对于南斯拉夫人民所进行的英勇斗争都寄予热烈的同情和关怀；苏联并曾尽一切力量来援助南斯拉夫的爱国志士。
    苏联军队在伟大卫国战争中对德国法西斯军队不断取得的胜利，对于艰苦斗争中的南斯拉夫人民曾是一种有力的支持和巨大的鼓舞。一九四四年，苏联军队对德国侵略者施行了十次歼灭性的打击，从苏联国土上完全肃清了德国侵略者的军队，并在苏联的国境以外继续追击敌人。由于苏联军队在这一年八月、九月和十月连续在国境以外胜利追击敌人的结果，罗马尼亚、保加利亚在德国法西斯的压迫下获得了解放，同时苏联军队并进入了匈牙利。这样，就根本改变了巴尔干的形势，大大地便利了南斯拉夫人民对敌人的斗争。这一年的九月六日，苏联军队到达了罗马尼亚和南斯拉夫的边境。铁托元帅在他给南斯拉夫人民解放军人员发布的命令中说：“你们和成千成万殉国的英雄们经受三年半最严重考验中所期待着的极大快乐的日子已经到来了。九月六日，我们伟大的联盟者—光荣红军—已抵达南斯拉夫边境了。”他号召南斯拉夫解放军人员无情地痛击敌人，歼灭敌军的人力。在这种胜利的鼓舞下，南斯拉夫人民解放军仅在九月初旬的作战中即解放了九十八个城市，毙俘敌人三万五千多名。
    在这种形势下，苏联并以自己的武装部队直接援助了南斯拉夫人民。苏联的乌克兰第三战线军队，在肃清了罗马尼亚南部和保加利亚的敌军以后，于九月底越过了保罗两国边境，进入了南斯拉夫，并于十月四日同南斯拉夫人民解放军的部队在尼哥丁以西会师。南斯拉夫人民同其他遭受过法西斯暴政的欧洲各族人民一样，欢欣鼓舞地迎接了苏联的军队。苏联军队和南斯拉夫人民解放军粉碎了敌人的抵抗，于十月中旬包围了南斯拉夫的首都贝尔格莱德。在贝尔格莱德的城下，苏联军队和南斯拉夫人民解放军的战士经过了五昼夜的突袭，终于在十月二十日共同把这个古老的斯拉夫城从希特勒占领者手中解放出来。苏联和南斯拉夫军人为解放贝尔格莱德进行的战斗，进一步巩固了苏南两国人民的兄弟友谊。南斯拉夫人民解放军统帅铁托元帅在贝尔格莱德解放后给苏联军队最高统帅斯大林的电报中说：“贝尔格莱德的解放对我国人民具有历史性的意义，因为在南斯拉夫，在这个人民长期遭受苦难的国土上，伟大的苏联的儿女和南斯拉夫的儿女共同流了血。南斯拉夫人民和苏联人民之间的兄弟友谊再一次加强了。”
    苏联军队和南斯拉夫人民解放军在共同作战中还解放了南斯拉夫的其他许多城市，清除了占领南斯拉夫东北各地区的敌人，并且在匈牙利领土上追击敌人的同时，截断了在南斯拉夫残存的希特勒军队。铁托元帅率领的勇敢的南斯拉夫人民解放军战士，在获得苏联武器的援助之后，便肃清了这些残敌，从而完成了南斯拉夫的全国解放。
    在战争年代中巩固起来的苏南两国人民的友谊，在战后的年代中曾有良好的发展，并在他们之间形成了最密切、最友好的关系。南斯拉夫劳动人民在战后推翻了王朝的统治，创立了人民民主共和国，并在国内政治和经济生活中进行了深刻的民主改造，从而摆脱了资本主义的束缚和压迫。南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的建立和它所进行的一系列的政治和经济的民主改造的工作，曾得到苏联人民和所有社会主义阵营国家的热情爱护和全力支持。苏联在战后最初几年中并给予南斯拉夫人民以无私的、巨大的援助。可惜在一九四八年底，由于和平和社会主义的敌人的破坏，苏南两国的友好关系发生了裂痕。帝国主义侵略集团曾经企图利用这种情况，制造两国之间的敌对和仇视，以便使巴尔干重新成为欧洲的“火药库”。但是他们的这种指望落空了。由于苏南两国近年来为了使两国关系正常化而不断采取的措施，特别是今年五月底和六月初举行苏南会谈的结果，发展两国之间的友好关系和全面合作的稳固基础又重新奠定了。现在，苏联和南斯拉夫两国的友好关系正在一天天地发展和巩固。这不但对加强苏南两国人民的传统的战斗友谊有着重大的意义，并且对于巩固欧洲和平和缓和国际紧张局势也是一个重大的贡献。
    苏南关系的正常化为恢复和发展南斯拉夫同社会主义阵营其他国家的友好关系打开了道路。中华人民共和国已和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国建立了正式的外交关系，这对于促进两国人民间的友谊和发展彼此间的经济和文化联系提供了良好的条件。中国人民对南斯拉夫人民一向怀着友好的感情，并对于他们在反对法西斯和争取祖国独立和自由的斗争中所表现的英勇精神有着崇高的敬意。我们相信，由于中南两国人民的所怀有的共同愿望，两国人民之间的友谊将不断得到发展和巩固。
