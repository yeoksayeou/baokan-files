Xinhua News Agency, Beirut: George Allen, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs, left Beirut on the 6th to return home after a three-day visit in Lebanon.

Allen said before his departure that he had discussed the U.S. "military aid" program with Lebanese government leaders. According to Beirut newspapers, Allen had suggested providing Lebanon with armaments.

The purpose of Allen's trip was to stop Middle Eastern countries from purchasing arms from People's Democratic countries. According to the Associated Press, although Allen said upon leaving that he believed his visits to Egypt and Lebanon were "fruitful in clearing up misunderstandings about the United States," some Arab leaders expressed doubts about this. It is known that Egypt has already rejected the U.S. proposal to stop Egypt from buying arms from Czechoslovakia.

    艾伦在黎巴嫩活动后回国
    据新华社讯　贝鲁特消息：美国负责近东、南亚和非洲事务的助理国务卿乔治·艾伦在黎巴嫩活动三天后，已在六日离开贝鲁特回国。
    艾伦在行前说，他曾同黎巴嫩政府领袖讨论了美国的“军事援助”计划。据贝鲁特报纸报道，艾伦曾经提出给予黎巴嫩军火的建议。
    艾伦此行的目的是要使中东国家停止向人民民主国家购买军火。据美联社报道，虽然艾伦在离开时说，他认为他的访问埃及和黎巴嫩，“在扫除对美国的误解方面”是“有收获的”，但是，一些阿拉伯国家的领袖却对此表示怀疑。大家知道，埃及已经拒绝了美国要埃及停止向捷克斯洛伐克购买军火的建议。
