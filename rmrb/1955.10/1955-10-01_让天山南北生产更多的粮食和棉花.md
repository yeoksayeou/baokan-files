Let the North and South of the Tianshan Mountains Produce More Grain and Cotton
	Han Jiang

Xinjiang is an extremely rich agricultural region of our country. Here, fertile land stretches as far as the eye can see. The Junggar Basin north of the Tianshan Mountains is the second largest black calcium soil area in our country, second only to the Northeast Plain. Around the Tarim Basin, there is also a large amount of sandy loam soil that can be reclaimed. Although rainfall is scarce and relatively dry, water sources are very abundant here. Inland rivers stretch for thousands of miles, and the melting snow from the towering Tianshan, Altai, and Kunlun Mountains is inexhaustible. The climate here is continental, and many oases are suitable for crop growth for eight months of the year. Common inland grain crops such as wheat, corn, sorghum, and rice can all be grown here with high yields. Xinjiang's soil and climate are also very suitable for growing cotton. The frost-free period in the main cotton-producing areas is more than 170 to 200 days. The shortest frost-free period in the Manas River basin is also more than 130 days. Cotton yields are higher than in general inland areas, and the quality is also good, mostly capable of spinning yarn of 32 counts or higher. With the increasing development of the motherland's socialist construction, this will become an important grain and cotton producing area in our country.

However, before liberation, due to the Kuomintang reactionary rulers and the cruel oppression and exploitation of landlords and despots, the farmers living on this fertile land could hardly maintain even the lowest level of life. Of course, there was no question of expanding reproduction. For many years, farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have been using extremely simple production tools and extensive cultivation methods, and the level of agricultural production has long been stagnant in a backward, primitive stage.

Xinjiang's agricultural production has achieved rapid and comprehensive development since liberation. In 1954, the sown area of various crops had expanded to more than 20.097 million mu. This means that since 1949, about 5 million mu of Gobi desert has been transformed into fertile fields. Grain harvests have been good year after year, and total output has increased by 76.65% compared to 1949. Last year, the 84,000 mu of wheat in Hami County achieved a large-scale high yield of 336 jin per mu. The new national record of 1,700 jin per mu for single-season rice was also created on the land of Xinjiang. The annual grain production here, calculated on the basis of the entire Xinjiang population, averaged 470 jin per person in 1949 (based on a population of 4.2 million), and approached 710 jin per person in 1954 (based on the population surveyed by the general election). In the past, Southern Xinjiang had surplus grain, while Northern Xinjiang did not have enough. Now, with the completion of various water conservancy projects, the grain production in Northern Xinjiang is also increasing year by year. The farmland near Urumqi has rapidly increased from 60,000 mu to more than 300,000 mu, and local residents can now buy cheap grain. Hami, Yanqi, and other places that have historically been short of grain have also had surplus grain since 1952.

The development of cotton production in Xinjiang has been even more rapid. Compared to 1949, although the sown area only exceeded by 74.61%, the total output increased by 217.86%. In particular, the production and construction corps planted more than 20,000 mu of cotton in the Manas River basin, achieving a yield of 402 jin of seed cotton per mu. In 1954, farmers in Turpan also harvested 314.9 jin per mu on more than 40,000 mu of large-scale cotton fields. These facts powerfully refuted the claim that "cotton cannot be grown in Northern Xinjiang" that has been around for many years. It fully demonstrates that Xinjiang has extremely favorable conditions for developing cotton production.

In addition, the sown area and total output of oil crops have been increasing year by year, providing the people of all ethnic groups with a relatively sufficient supply of edible oil and supplying more for industrial needs.

The changes in Xinjiang's agricultural production in the past six years have been astonishing. The sown area and output of various crops have greatly exceeded the highest historical levels. This has strongly supported Xinjiang's industrial construction and other construction projects.

The rapid development of Xinjiang's agricultural production in just a few years is not only due to the active leadership and strong support of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, but mainly due to the fact that farmers of all ethnic groups have actively embarked on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation after land reform. The mutual assistance and cooperation movement in Xinjiang has been steadily advancing in recent years. Through mutual assistance and cooperative organizations, people of all ethnic groups have not only solved the difficulties in individual production, but also continuously improved farming techniques, increased yields, and demonstrated the superiority of being organized in many ways. Taking the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Turpan as an example, in 1952, when they first organized mutual aid teams, the cotton yield per mu increased by an average of 30 jin of seed cotton compared to individual farming. In the first year after becoming a cooperative, the cotton yield doubled again, with 18 mu of high-yield fields reaching 700 jin per mu. Although Xin Zhuangzi in Aya District, Hami County, suffered a severe drought last year, under the leadership of the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative, farmers actively dug wells and installed waterwheels, finally overcoming the disaster and enabling Xin Zhuangzi's wheat to still yield 327 jin per mu. According to statistics from 25 agricultural cooperatives in Southern and Northern Xinjiang in 1954, wheat yields were 11.5% higher than those of surrounding mutual aid teams and 25.1% higher than those of individual farmers.

In the past six years, the progress in agricultural technology reform in Xinjiang has been very significant. Before liberation, in Southern Xinjiang, an average of two households had one "kantuman" (a type of hoe) and six households had one soil plow. In some places, people even used wooden plows to cultivate the land. In many areas, farmers would sow seeds and then wait for the harvest without fertilizing or weeding. Cultivation techniques were extremely backward, so the average yield per mu of various grain crops was only around 100 jin. After liberation, the People's Government vigorously guided farmers to carry out technological reforms and develop production. By the end of 1954, agricultural loans totaling more than 26 million yuan had been issued, and more than 2.3 million pieces of various old-fashioned agricultural implements had been supplied one after another. On average, each farmer household had one "kantuman" and one soil plow, and more than 46,000 pieces of various new-style agricultural implements were promoted. This initially changed the situation of extreme shortage and backwardness of agricultural production tools in rural areas, creating favorable conditions for improving cultivation techniques.

In order to meet the urgent demands of farmers of all ethnic groups after being organized to comprehensively improve cultivation techniques, the government also gradually established agricultural technology extension agencies. In 1955, there were 70 technology extension stations in Xinjiang, and agricultural counties and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral counties basically had a station in each county. Two agricultural machinery stations were established in Urumqi and Suiding as key points. These technology extension agencies have focused on mutual assistance and cooperation in recent years to promote technological reform work. Today, Ukrainian winter wheat and S3173 fine cotton have been planted in many areas of both North and South Tianshan. Fertilization and weeding have become habits for farmers of all ethnic groups. Fallow plowing, winter irrigation, row planting, close planting, and cotton field management are also being widely promoted in many areas. Spring harrowing has also been implemented for winter wheat in some areas.

While reforming agricultural technology, the fight against natural disasters has also begun. In recent years, great achievements have been made in locust control. In addition to chemical and manual locust control, with the support of the Central People's Government and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, aerial locust control was carried out in major locust areas for the first time in Xinjiang's history, starting in 1953. Over the past three years, the Soviet Union has sent 33 aircraft and a large number of locust control personnel to help with locust control. The area of aerial locust control alone reached more than 2,669,000 mu. The flying locusts in Bosten Lake have been basically eliminated, and various types of locusts in Northern Xinjiang have been severely damaged. The victory on the locust control front not only guaranteed the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production but also greatly enhanced the "man will conquer nature" mentality of the people of all ethnic groups.

State-owned farms are a strong socialist force in Xinjiang, and their proportion in agricultural production is constantly increasing. In 1955, the number of various state-owned farms in Xinjiang had grown to 73, and the sown area accounted for 5% of the total sown area in Xinjiang. This will play a major demonstration and promotion role in the cooperation and mechanization of agriculture in Xinjiang. In recent years, not only have military reclamation farms achieved excellent production results, with their degree of mechanization reaching 42% to 60% or more, and achieving large-scale bumper harvests year after year, but also local state-owned farms have made great improvements in business management and cultivation techniques. Advanced technologies such as cross-sowing of wheat, artificial pollination of corn, foliar fertilization of crops, and furrow irrigation have been promoted in many farms. These farms also frequently organize farmers to visit crops, conduct demonstrations of new agricultural implements, impart crop cultivation techniques, and exchange labor for cultivation to specifically guide farmers to improve cultivation techniques.

The prospects for agricultural production development in Xinjiang are infinitely broad. There is enormous potential for both expanding cultivated land area and increasing yield per unit area. According to available statistics, there are approximately 105 million mu of wasteland that can be developed in Xinjiang. With the construction of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty railway and the completion of various large and medium-sized water conservancy projects, these wastelands will be transformed into fertile fields one after another, enabling the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains to increase the production of more grain and cotton for the country.

    让天山南北生产更多的粮食和棉花
    寒江
    新疆是我国一个极其富庶的农业区。这里，肥沃的土地辽阔无边。天山北部的准噶尔盆地是我国仅次于东北大平原的第二大黑钙土区，塔里木盆地周围更有大量砂质壤土可以垦种。这里虽然雨量稀少，比较干旱，水源却非常丰富。内陆河流千里纵横，高峻连绵的天山、阿尔泰山、昆仑山的融雪取用不竭。这里的气候是大陆性气候，很多绿洲全年有八个月适宜于农作物的生长。内地的一般粮食作物如小麦、玉米、高粱、稻谷等，这里都能种植，产量很高。新疆的土壤和气候也非常适宜于种植棉花，主要棉区的无霜期都在一百七十天到二百天以上，玛纳斯河流域的无霜期最短，也有一百三十多天，棉花的产量比内地一般地区要高，质量也好，大都能纺三十二支以上的细纱。随着祖国社会主义建设事业的日益发展，这里将成为我国一个重要的棉粮产区。
    但是，解放前，由于国民党反动统治者和地主恶霸的残酷压榨和剥削，居住在这块肥沃土地上的农民们连最低程度的生活也难以维持。当然更谈不到扩大再生产了，多少年来，新疆各族农民一直用着极其简陋的生产工具和粗放的耕作方法，农业生产水平长期停滞在低落的、原始的阶段。
    新疆农业生产在解放以后得到了迅速的、全面的发展。一九五四年各种作物的播种面积已经扩大到两千零九十七万多亩，这就是说，一九四九年以来，约有五百万亩戈壁沙滩变成了良田。粮食年年丰收，总产量比一九四九年提高了百分之七十六点六五。去年哈密县八万四千多亩小麦，获得了每亩三百三十六斤的大面积丰产。全国单季水稻每亩一千七百斤的新纪录，也是在新疆的土地上创造的。这里每年生产的粮食，若以全疆人口来计算，一九四九年每人平均为四百七十斤（按四百二十万人计算），到一九五四年已接近七百一十斤（按普选调查人口计算）。过去，南疆的粮食吃不完，北疆的粮食不够吃。如今，随着各项水利工程的建成，北疆的粮食也在一年比一年增多了。乌鲁木齐附近的农田已由六万亩迅速增加到了三十多万亩，当地居民已能买到廉价的粮食。历史上一直缺粮的哈密、焉耆等地，从一九五二年开始也都有了余粮。
    新疆棉花生产的发展更为迅速。拿一九五四年和一九四九年相比，播种面积虽只超过百分之七十四点六一，总产量却增加了百分之二百一十七点八六。特别是生产建设部队在玛纳斯河流域种植的两万多亩棉花，获得了每亩四百零二斤籽棉的成绩。一九五四年吐鲁番农民也在四万多亩大面积棉田上，每亩获得了三百一十四点九斤的收成。这些事实，有力地驳倒了多少年来“北疆不能植棉”的说法，它充分说明在新疆有着发展棉花生产的极为良好的条件。
    此外，油料作物的播种面积和总产量都在逐年增加，使各族人民有了比较充足的食油，更多地供应了工业的需要。
    六年来新疆农业生产的变化是惊人的，各种作物，无论是播种面积和产量，都大大超过了历史上的最高水平。这就有力地支援了新疆的工业建设和其他各项建设。
    新疆农业生产能在短短几年里发展这么快，除了新疆生产建设部队的积极带头生产和大力支援外，主要是由于土地改革以后各族农民积极地走上了互助合作的道路。新疆的互助合作运动，几年来一直在稳步前进。各族人民通过互助合作组织，不仅解决了个体生产中的困难，而且不断改进耕作技术，提高了产量，多方面显示了组织起来的优越性。以吐鲁番五星农业合作社来说，一九五二年当他们刚组织互助组时，每亩棉花产量就比单干时平均增加了三十斤籽棉，转社后的第一年，棉花产量又提高了一倍，有十八亩丰产田每亩并达到了七百斤。哈密县阿牙区新庄子去年虽遭了严重旱灾，但在红旗农业合作社带动下，农民积极打井、装水车，终于战胜了灾害，使新庄子的小麦每亩仍收到了三百二十七斤。一九五四年据南北疆二十五个农业合作社的统计，小麦产量要较周围互助组高百分之十一点五，较单干农民高出百分之二十五点一。
    六年来，新疆在农业技术改革方面的进步是非常突出的。解放前，南疆的农民平均每两户才有一把坎土镘，每六户才有一张土犁，甚至有的地方还用木犁耕地。不少地区的农民撒下种子后，不施肥、不除草，就等收割。耕作技术极为落后，因而各种粮食作物每亩平均产量只有百斤上下。解放后人民政府大力指导农民进行技术改革，发展生产。截至一九五四年底，先后发放的农业贷款就有二千六百多万元，陆续供应的各种旧式农具有二百三十多万件，平均每户农民已有了一把坎土镘，一张土犁，而且推广了各种新式农具四万六千多件。这就初步改变了农村生产工具极为缺乏和落后的状况，给提高耕作技术创造了良好条件。
    为满足各族农民组织起来后全面改进耕作技术的迫切要求，政府还逐步建立了农业技术推广机构。一九五五年，全疆已有了七十个技术推广站，农业县和半农半牧县基本上已每县有站。在乌鲁木齐和绥定重点建立了两个农业机器站。这些技术推广机构，几年来以互助合作为重点，推行了技术改革工作。如今，乌克兰冬麦、斯三一七三良棉，在天山南北很多地区都已种植。施肥、除草已成了各族农民的习惯。就是伏耕、冬灌、条播、密植以及棉田的管理工作，也正在不少地区普遍推行。部分地区冬麦还实行了春耙。
    在农业技术改革的同时，同自然灾害作斗争也已开始。这几年来，治蝗工作取得很大成绩。除了药械和人工治蝗外，从一九五三年起，在中央人民政府的支持和苏联无私援助下，在主要蝗区进行了新疆历史上从未有过的飞机治蝗。三年来苏联先后派来飞机三十三架和大批治蝗人员帮助治蝗，仅飞机治蝗面积即达二百六十六万九千多亩。博斯腾湖的飞蝗已基本消灭，北疆各类蝗虫已受到重大杀伤。治蝗战线上的胜利，不仅保证了农牧业生产的发展，并大大提高了各族人民“人定胜天”思想。
    国营农场是新疆一支强大的社会主义力量，它在农业生产中的比重正不断增长。一九五五年全疆各类国营农场已发展到七十三处，播种面积占到全疆总播种面积的百分之五。这对新疆农业的合作化和机械化将起重大的示范和推动作用。几年来，不仅军垦农场获得了优异的生产成绩，他们机械化的程度已达到百分之四十二至六十以上，连年获得了大面积丰收；地方国营农场，无论在经营管理、耕作技术上也都有了很大改进。小麦交叉播种、包谷人工授粉、作物根外追肥以及沟灌等先进技术，已在很多农场推行起来。这些农场还经常通过组织农民参观庄稼，进行新农具操作表演、作物栽培技术传授，变工代耕等方式具体指导农民改进耕作技术。
    新疆在农业生产上的发展前途是无限广阔的。无论在扩大耕地面积和提高单位面积产量方面都有巨大的潜力。据现有资料统计，新疆可以开发的荒地约有一亿零五百多万亩。随着兰州——乌鲁木齐——阿拉木图铁路的修建，随着各项大、中型水利工程的完工，这些荒地将相继变为良田，使天山南北为国家增产更多的粮食和棉花。
