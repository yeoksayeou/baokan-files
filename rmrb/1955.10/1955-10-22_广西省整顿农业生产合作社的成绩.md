Achievements in Rectifying Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Guangxi Province
He Yiran, Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Guangxi Provincial Committee

Last winter and this spring, Guangxi Province established 17,174 agricultural production cooperatives on the basis of 766 old cooperatives, which is more than 22 times the number last year. The proportion of peasant households joining the cooperatives increased from 0.5% to 9.46%. Seventy-eight percent of the province's townships now have cooperatives, and 33 cooperative townships have emerged in the province.

After the establishment of this batch of cooperatives, they encountered severe frost and drought. The newly built cooperatives' crops such as sweet potatoes, potatoes, winter corn, and beans were all damaged by frost; barley, wheat, and buckwheat also suffered severe losses. The planned output of winter crops for the entire province was 748 million jin (converted to grain), but the actual harvest was only 260 million jin. The cooperatives planted the most winter crops, so the losses were also the greatest. During the tense spring plowing season, there was a prolonged drought without rain. At that time, the grain situation in rural areas also became tense. Agricultural production cooperatives encountered serious difficulties, some members' thinking wavered, and cooperative cadres also lacked confidence in running the cooperatives well. At that time, 32 cooperatives collapsed, and more than 10,000 mutual aid teams disbanded. The mutual aid and cooperation movement seemed to be shrouded in shadows.

In this situation, a few comrades doubted whether this batch of newly established cooperatives could be consolidated. At that time, the drought was severe, and well-off middle peasants, seeing that their fields had good water conservancy conditions, were afraid that the members with poor water conservancy conditions would take advantage of them, and they asked to withdraw from the cooperatives one after another. In the fifth agricultural production cooperative of Sande Township and the second agricultural production cooperative of Liumei Township in Rong County, a total of 19 households requested to withdraw from the cooperatives. Seven households finally withdrew. Among the seven households that withdrew, five were well-off middle peasants. Seeing this situation, some comrades believed that the cooperatives did not take good enough care of the well-off peasants. Some comrades said: "The cadres have no experience, and they set up too many cooperatives all at once!" Some comrades even blamed the tense grain situation on the cooperatives!

In view of the above situation, the Guangxi Provincial Committee decided to vigorously rectify the work of the cooperatives, and in the summer, it transferred more than 8,000 cadres to this work.

All 15,538 cooperatives in the province (after the division of the Qinzhou area, the number of cooperatives decreased somewhat) have been rectified. Except for 0.2% of the cooperatives that were transferred to mutual aid teams or disbanded, the rest have been gradually consolidated. The number of first-class cooperatives that have been consolidated has increased from 4,002 before the rectification to 5,203 (i.e., from 25% to over 33%); the number of second-class cooperatives that are basically consolidated but still have some problems has increased from 8,842 to 8,959 (i.e., from 56% to 57%); and the number of third-class cooperatives with many problems has decreased from 2,694 to 1,376 (i.e., from 17% to 8%). Through the implementation of the policy of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, improved management, and strengthened political and ideological work, the ideological awareness of the members has been further improved, and the confidence of the wavering members in taking the socialist road has been strengthened. The number of peasant households withdrawing from the cooperatives accounted for only 1% (including the purging of bad elements).

After the cooperatives were rectified, although they encountered severe drought and insect pests, more than 83% of the cooperatives still increased production during the summer harvest. According to a typical survey of 1,738 cooperatives, only three cooperatives had lower yields than peasants outside the cooperatives. The vast majority of cooperatives showed their superiority in the struggle against disasters. The single rice crop of the second agricultural production cooperative in Xincheng Township, Guiping County, suffered a 24% reduction in production due to the disaster compared with last year, but the well-off peasant Jiang Jinran in the same village, who had four laborers and two large cattle, also suffered a 59% reduction in production. The Dazhang Agricultural Production Cooperative harvested 300 jin of early rice per mu, while the individual peasant Yang Fuxing, who competed with the cooperative, harvested only 150 jin. The masses reflected: The same disaster, but different results inside and outside the cooperative.

Due to the increasingly significant fact that the cooperatives have increased production, and due to the increasing socialist awareness of the vast number of peasants, a high tide of the cooperative movement has appeared throughout the province. According to incomplete statistics, more than 100,000 mutual aid teams in the province have requested to transfer to cooperatives or join cooperatives. In the Baise area of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, more than 21,000 mutual aid teams have applied to transfer to cooperatives or join cooperatives. In Rong County's Third District, 306 mutual aid teams have now requested to transfer to cooperatives, and Zhu Jinhe, the leader of the mutual aid team, has applied to the Hongguang Cooperative six times. In Tan Village Township, Yishan County, only one mutual aid team requested to "register" to transfer to a cooperative in June, but now eight teams have "registered." Xu Xiguang, a peasant who withdrew from the cooperative in Xiangnan Township, Rong County, firmly requested to return to the cooperative, and he said everywhere: "Whenever you call, I will come!" "If you call in the middle of the night, I will come in the middle of the night, if you call in the morning, I will come in the morning!" Liang Fuqiu's mutual aid team in the Third District of Binyang County said after visiting the cooperative across the river: "We will build a bridge across the river to join the cooperative!"

Facts have proved that after the establishment of cooperatives, they can be run well through continuous rectification. As long as the rectification is carried out conscientiously and earnestly, not only can most of the existing cooperatives be gradually consolidated, but also the high tide of the cooperative movement can be promoted to appear earlier.

The several rectification works from the spring plowing season to the summer fully illustrate the following issues:

First, running agricultural production cooperatives well requires constant and hard work. It is wrong to exaggerate the difficulties and think that cooperatives cannot be run more or run well when seeing some difficulties. On the contrary, it is also wrong to think that everything will be fine after the cooperatives are established and not to work hard to consolidate the cooperatives. It should be recognized that changing from a scattered individual economy to a collective economy will inevitably bring many new problems. Although some problems seem serious, in essence, they are problems in development. As long as they are discovered and solved in production, the cooperatives will definitely be gradually consolidated. The problems that may occur after the establishment of the cooperatives are nothing more than the following: The "three appraisals" work and the establishment of management agencies have not been resolved properly; there is a lack of production and management experience, and the labor organization is chaotic; some members are ideologically uneasy due to disasters in production or difficulties in life; counter-revolutionary elements are instigating sabotage; the operation of rich peasants outside the cooperatives is tempting to some well-off members... Solving one of these problems will improve the degree of consolidation of the cooperative. Through continuous efforts, these problems will be solved one by one. Facts have proved that doing sufficient preparations before establishing a cooperative, resolutely implementing the policies of voluntary participation, mutual benefit, and class line during the establishment of the cooperative, and seriously rectifying the cooperative after its establishment to ensure that the cooperative increases production and the members increase income are important conditions for ensuring the healthy development of the cooperative movement.

Second, it is necessary to adapt to the needs of the new situation and improve working methods. In the past, the number of cooperatives was small, and each cooperative was assigned a full-time cadre to run the cooperative and was constantly rectified. Therefore, these cooperatives were generally run well. Now, on the one hand, there are more cooperatives, and there are not so many full-time cadres to dispatch; on the other hand, there is some experience in running cooperatives, and there are a number of good cooperatives that can be used as examples. To adapt to this new situation, the method of organizing a strong force to rectify several times a year should be combined with the method of relying on the Party branch to conduct regular leadership of the cooperative to ensure the consolidation of the cooperative. After the end of the establishment of cooperatives in Guangxi Province this spring, a rectification work was carried out to solve the problems left over from the establishment of cooperatives, and fixed labor organizations were established in the cooperatives, fixed cultivated areas and farming cattle and farm tools were divided, and a responsibility system for the fixed use of farming cattle and farm tools by the production teams was established (fixed is not absolute). In the summer, the province organized 8,223 cadres who were divorced from production to participate in the rectification work in June, July, and August. In the rectification, the implementation of the policies of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, the promotion of short-term arrangements for agricultural affairs and contracting systems, and the improvement of the operation and management of cooperatives have achieved remarkable results. However, due to the extremely heavy tasks of economic work and political work in rural areas, large-scale rectification work can only be carried out two or three times a year; and doing a good job in the production of the cooperatives is a regular task, so it is very necessary to strengthen the regular leadership of the rural Party branches over cooperation. Rectification relies on the branch, and regular work also relies on the regular leadership of the branch. The important way for the branch to run the cooperative is to do a good job in key points and use points to lead the whole area. In order to achieve this, experience can be exchanged through the joint cooperative committee (there are about 5,000 such organizations in the province), and small training courses can be held with the purpose of promoting a specific experience. If a branch finds that a cooperative has serious problems, it should specifically help solve them. The Provincial Party Committee has decided to train 9,000 full-time cooperative instructors to assist the branches in running the cooperatives. In the future, any other work carried out in rural areas should ensure that it does not hinder the consolidation of the cooperatives.

Third, the rectification work should be centered on production. The purpose of establishing and rectifying cooperatives is to do a good job in production. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly discover problems, solve problems, and implement the Party's policies through organizing production. Judging from the situation of this summer's rectification, the basic problems in doing a good job in production lie in: First, adapting to local conditions and grasping the key to increasing production. That is, when formulating a production plan, it is necessary to grasp the key to increasing production throughout the year and formulate specific measures, such as changing one crop to two crops (generally increasing production by 100 to 200 jin), changing dry land to paddy fields, processing and adding fertilizer, improving farming techniques, changing to high-yield crops, and developing diversified operations. Facts have proved that there is a key to increasing production in every cooperative, but they are different from each other. Not only is it necessary to grasp the key to increasing production throughout the year, but also to grasp the key to increasing production at the present time and do a good job in the current production work. The ideological emotions of the members often change with the production of the cooperative. For example, if a cooperative did not accumulate much fertilizer during the spring plowing, the members were afraid of reducing production. If more fertilizer was accumulated, their thinking would be stabilized; if the seedlings of a cooperative were not as good as those of the peasants outside the cooperative, the members would be uneasy. Later, when the production was done well and the seedlings were indeed growing better than those outside the cooperative, their emotions would be stabilized again. The influence of the cooperative on the outside of the cooperative also varies depending on the production of each season. If the production of a season is not as good as that of the outside of the cooperative, it will cause doubts among the peasants outside the cooperative. Another basic problem in doing a good job in production is to improve labor productivity. It is necessary to help the cooperatives establish appropriate labor organizations; reasonably stipulate labor remuneration; establish clear responsibility systems and labor discipline; strengthen production guidance and the planning of work attendance; and strengthen ideological and political work. After the summer rectification in Guangxi Province, 89% of the cooperatives have established agricultural affairs arrangements (short arrangements) of three to five days to one solar term. Now 8,933 cooperatives have implemented temporary contracting, 2,897 cooperatives have implemented seasonal contracting, and about 500 cooperatives have implemented a permanent contracting and overproduction reward system. Some advanced cooperatives have also established an agricultural work "acceptance" system. Therefore, the labor productivity of the cooperatives has been significantly improved.

Fourth, it is necessary to help different types of cooperatives solve different problems separately. Some cooperatives (mainly third-class cooperatives) have weak backbones and impure organizations, which is the root cause of the cooperative's poor production and disunity. These cooperatives must cultivate leading backbones from poor peasants and make appropriate adjustments to the original cadres. For cooperatives with impure organizations, it is necessary to help purify the organizations. For cooperatives that have not implemented the policies well, it is necessary to promote them to correct the policies. All cooperatives that have seriously solved these specific problems can be quickly consolidated. For cooperatives with serious problems, it is necessary to quickly send people to help them and try not to let a single cooperative collapse. The collapse of a cooperative has a very bad impact. When the Chenbu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luocheng County collapsed, the landlords and rich peasants immediately helped the upper and middle peasants who had disbanded, and they shouted everywhere: "Brothers born of the same mother still have to separate their families, how can cooperatives be run!" When the situation of the thirty or so third-class cooperatives in this county was serious, some poor members cried. At this time, the county party committee organized manpower and material resources to vigorously help these cooperatives overcome difficulties, actively helping those who were willing to run the cooperatives, and allowing those who resolutely did not want to run the cooperatives to withdraw. All the collapsed cooperatives were restored. At this time, many cadres of the third-class cooperatives ran to say: Your restoration has also consolidated us! The mutual aid teams reflected: Running the mutual aid teams well and striving to transfer to the cooperatives is our slogan. If the cooperatives collapse and transfer to the mutual aid teams, our hope will also be blown away. This shows that for all the cooperatives that have been established, the leadership must do everything possible to run them well.

    广西省整顿农业生产合作社的成绩
    中共广西省委农村工作部长　贺亦然
    广西省去冬今春在七百六十六个老社的基础上，又建立了一万七千一百七十四个农业生产合作社，为去年的二十二倍多；入社农户占总农户的比例由百分之○·五上升到百分之九·四六。全省百分之七十八的乡有了合作社，省内还出现了三十三个合作化的乡。
    这一批合作社建成之后，却遇到了严重的霜冻和旱灾。新建社种植的甘薯、马铃薯、冬玉米、豆类等作物都冻坏了；大麦、小麦、荞麦也受到了严重的损失。全省冬季作物的计划产量七亿四千八百万斤（折谷计算），实际只收了二亿六千万斤。合作社冬季种的作物最多，所以损失也最大。在紧张的春耕期间，长期干旱无雨。当时农村中的粮食情况也紧张起来。农业生产合作社遇到了严重的困难，部分社员思想动摇，社的干部也对办好社缺乏信心。当时，三十二个社垮台了，一万多个互助组解散了。互助合作运动好像蒙上了一层暗影。
    在这种情况下，少数同志便怀疑这批新建的合作社能不能巩固？当时旱灾严重，富裕中农看到自己的田地水利条件好，害怕水利条件差的社员沾了他们的光，纷纷要求退社。容县三德乡第五农业生产合作社、六美乡第二农业生产合作社等五个社中，共有十九户要求退社。有七户终于退了社。在退社的七户中有五户是富裕中农。有些同志看到这种情况，便认为合作社对富裕农民照顾不够。有的同志说：“干部没有经验，一下子办多了！”有的同志甚至把粮食的紧张情况也归罪于合作社了！
    鉴于上述情况，广西省委决定大力进行整顿合作社的工作，夏季曾抽调八千多干部投入这一工作。
    全省一万五千五百三十八个合作社（划出了钦州专区后，社数减少了些）全部经过了整顿。除千分之二的社转组或解散外，其余都逐步地巩固起来了。已经巩固的一类社由整社前的四千零二个增加到五千二百零三个（即由百分之二十五上升到百分之三十三强）；基本上巩固，但还有某些问题的二类社由八千八百四十二个增加到八千九百五十九个（即由百分之五十六上升到百分之五十七）；问题仍然很多的三类社则由二千六百九十四个减少到一千三百七十六个（即由百分之十七下降到百分之八）。通过贯彻实行自愿互利政策，改进经营管理和加强政治思想工作，进一步提高了社员的思想觉悟，坚定了表现动摇的社员走社会主义道路的信心。退社农户只占百分之一（清洗坏分子在内）。
    合作社经过整顿，虽然遭遇了严重的旱灾、虫灾，夏收的时候仍有百分之八十三以上的社增产。据一千七百三十八个社的典型调查，只有三个社的产量不如社外农民。绝大多数合作社在向灾害作斗争中，显示了优越性。桂平县新成乡第二农业生产合作社的单糙因遭灾比去年减产百分之二十四，但同屯拥有四个劳动力、两条大牛的富裕农民蒋金然也减收了百分之五十九。大章农业生产合作社每亩早稻收了三百斤，而同社比赛的个体农民杨富兴则只收一百五十斤。群众反映：同样受灾，内外不同。
    由于合作社增产的事实日益显著，由于广大农民的社会主义觉悟日益提高，合作化运动的高潮已在全省范围内出现了。据不完全的统计，全省已有十多万个互助组要求转社或入社。桂西僮族自治区百色专区有二万一千多个互助组申请转社或入社。容县三区现已有三百零六个互助组要求转社，互助组长朱锦和曾经六次向红光合作社要求入社。宜山县谭村乡六月间只有一个互助组请求“挂号”转社，现在已有八个组“挂上号”了。容县厢南乡退社农民许喜光又坚决要求回社，他到处说：“何时叫，何时到！”“半夜叫入半夜入，天明叫入天明入！”宾阳县三区梁福球互助组，参观了江对岸合作社后说：“架条桥过江也要参加社！”
    事实证明，社建立起来后，经过不断的整顿，是完全可以办好的。只要切实地认真地进行整顿，不但已有的合作社绝大部分能够逐步巩固起来，而且还可以促使合作化运动高潮提早出现。
    春耕到夏季的几次整社工作，充分说明了下面几个问题：
    一、办好农业生产合作社需要经常努力地工作。夸大困难，看到若干困难便认为合作社不能办多、不能办好的思想，是错误的。相反，认为合作社建立起来，就万事大吉，而不去努力进行各项巩固社的工作，也是错误的。应该认识，由分散的个体经济变为集体经济，必然会带来很多新的问题。有些问题看来虽然严重，但就其本质来说，乃是发展中的问题，只要在生产中随发现，随解决，合作社就一定能够逐步地巩固。合作社建成以后可能发生的问题不外乎下面这些方面：“三评”工作和建立管理机构等问题解决得不尽妥当；缺乏生产和管理的经验，劳动组织混乱；有些社员因生产上遇到灾害或生活上遇到困难而思想不安；反革命分子挑拨破坏；社外富农的经营对某些富裕社员的诱惑……这些问题解决了一个，社的巩固程度便会提高一步。经过不断地努力，这些问题就会一一得到解决。事实证明，建社前做好充分的准备，建社中坚决贯彻执行自愿、互利政策和阶级路线，建成之后认真进行整顿，保证合作社增加生产和社员增加收入，是保证合作化运动健康发展的重要条件。
    二、要适应新的形势的需要，改进工作方法。从前，合作社的数量少，社社派有专职办社干部，又经常不断地进行整社工作，因此，这些社一般办得还好。如今，一方面，社多了，没有那么多专职干部可派遣了；另方面，办社有了一些经验，有了一批好社可做榜样。适应这一新的形势，应当把一年中组织强大的力量整顿几次的办法和平时依靠党支部对社进行经常性的领导的方法结合起来，以保证合作社的巩固。广西省今春建社结束之后；曾经进行了一次整社工作，解决了建社中的遗留问题，并在合作社中建立了固定的劳动组织，划分了固定的耕作区和耕牛农具，建立了生产队固定使用耕牛农具的责任制度（固定也不是绝对的）。夏季，全省又在六、七、八三个月中，组织八千二百二十三个脱离生产的干部参加整社工作。在整社中，贯彻执行自愿、互利政策，推行农事的短期安排和包工制，改善合作社的经营管理等，成绩是很显著的。但是，由于农村中经济工作、政治工作任务极其繁重，大规模的整社工作，每年只能进行两三次；而搞好社的生产，又是经常性的工作，所以加强农村党支部对合作化的经常领导，是非常必要的。整社依靠支部，平时工作也要依靠支部的经常领导。支部办社的重要办法，是搞好重点，以点带面。为了做到以点带面，可以通过联社委员会（全省约有五千多个乡有了这种组织）交流经验，可以举办以推广一个具体经验为目的的小型训练班。发现哪个社问题严重，支部应专门去帮助解决。省委已决定培养九千个专职的合作社辅导员，协助支部办社。今后农村进行任何其他工作，都应保证不妨碍社的巩固。
    三、整社工作要以生产为中心。建社、整社的目的都是为了搞好生产，因此要通过组织生产去不断发现问题，解决问题，贯彻执行党的政策。从今夏整社的情况看来，搞好生产的基本问题在于：第一、因社制宜，抓住增产关键。这就是要在制定生产计划的时候，抓住全年的增产关键，订出具体措施来，如一糙变两糙（一般地可增产一、二百斤），旱田变水田，加工加肥，改进耕作技术，改种高产作物和举办多种经营等。事实证明，增产关键，每社都有，只不过彼此不同罢了。不仅要抓全年的增产关键，还要抓住当前的增产关键，做好当前的生产工作。社员的思想情绪往往是随着社的生产好坏而变化的，比如有的社春耕时肥料积得不多，社员便害怕减产，肥积多了，思想就安定了；有的社禾苗比不上社外农民的，社员思想就不安起来，后来把生产搞好了，禾苗确比社外的生长得好，他们的情绪便又安定下来。社对社外的影响也是因每一季节的生产好坏而有所不同的，哪一个季节生产不如社外，就会引起社外农民的疑虑。搞好生产的另一基本问题是提高劳动生产率。必须帮助合作社建立适当的劳动组织；合理地规定劳动报酬；建立起明确的责任制度和劳动纪律；加强生产指导和出工的计划性；加强思想政治工作。广西省经过夏季整社，已有百分之八十九的社建立了三、五天到一个节气的农事安排（短安排）。现在有八千九百三十三个社实行临时包工，二千八百九十七个社实行季节包工，大约五百个社实行常年包工超产奖励制，有些先进社还建立了农活“验收”制度。因此，合作社的劳动生产率有了显著的提高。
    四、要分别帮助不同类型的社解决不同的问题。有些社（主要是三类社）骨干过弱、组织不纯，这是社的生产不好、团结不好的根源。这类社必须培养贫农的领导骨干，对原有干部作适当的调整。对组织不纯的社，要帮助纯洁组织。对政策贯彻执行不好的社，要推动它端正政策。凡是认真解决了这些具体问题的社都能迅速巩固起来。对问题严重的社，要迅速派人去扶助，尽可能不让一个社垮台。垮了一个社，影响很不好。罗城县陈布农业生产合作社垮台了，地主、富农马上去同散伙的上中农帮工，并且到处喧嚷：“兄弟一母所生，还要分家，合作社怎能办成！”当这个县的三十多个三类社情况严重的时候，有些贫困社员哭了起来。这时，县委组织了人力、物力大力帮助这些社克服困难，对愿意办的积极帮助办下去，坚决不愿办的准许退社，垮台的社又全部恢复起来了。这时不少三类社的干部跑来说：你们一恢复，把我们也巩固了！互助组反映：办好互助组，争取转社是我们的口号，社要垮台转组，我们的希望也一风吹了。这说明：凡是已经建成的社，领导上都要尽一切力量把它们办好。
