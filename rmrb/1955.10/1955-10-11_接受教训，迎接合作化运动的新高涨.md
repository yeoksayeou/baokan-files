    Accept Lessons, Welcome a New Upsurge in the Cooperative Movement
    Wang Maosong, Secretary of the Lin'an County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhejiang Province
    Recently, after studying the central government and Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation, and comparing and examining the development history of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province, I deeply felt that Chairman Mao's instructions are completely correct. In the past few years, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Lin'an County has been moving forward, but the leadership work has always been unable to keep up with the development of the movement. The instructions of the central government and Chairman Mao gave us a profound education, made us realize the right-leaning errors in our leadership work, and boosted our courage to lead the masses to advance on the road to socialism.
    After the completion of the land reform in the spring of 1951 in Lin'an County, the party organization called on the peasants to organize and develop production. The peasant masses actively responded to the call of the Party, and organized 837 mutual aid teams in the first year. More than 3,000 peasant households joined the teams, accounting for 10.5 percent of the total number of households in the county. Although the mutual aid teams in this year were still temporary in nature, many peasants had already experienced the superiority of "getting organized"; in the spring of 1952, some mutual aid teams requested to take a step further and establish agricultural production cooperatives. This was something that our leadership had not anticipated in advance, so when the peasants spontaneously established cooperatives, we followed up and provided leadership, establishing one agricultural production cooperative. This cooperative had nine member households and 94 mu of paddy fields. In the first year of operation, the yield per mu increased from 470 jin in the mutual aid team to 634 jin, creating the highest record of increased production in the county. This fact educated the vast number of peasants, making them begin to see that agricultural cooperation was the road to prosperity. By the spring of 1953, batches of mutual aid teams were requesting to establish agricultural production cooperatives. However, because we did not have enough understanding of the masses' level of consciousness and the Party's leadership strength, although we publicized the superiority of agricultural cooperatives in various forms, we did not meet the needs of the masses in actual work, and only focused on trying out another cooperative. Many mutual aid teams that wanted to switch to cooperatives could not do so, so they set up "black cooperatives," calling them "contracted work and output" mutual aid teams, which were actually agricultural production cooperatives with unified land management. A total of 20 were established in the county. After these cooperatives implemented unified land management, a new atmosphere immediately appeared in production, and the income of the members increased significantly. For example, one "contracted work and output" mutual aid team in Yangling Township distributed 16 jin of grain per labor day in the summer harvest pre-distribution alone. However, after the summer harvest of that year, Lin'an County blindly opposed "rash advances," and actually dissolved these cooperatives that the peasant activists had worked hard to establish for several months. In the winter of 1953, the county vigorously publicized the Party's general line during the transition period. The vast number of peasants saw the happy prospects of socialism and eagerly yearned to take the road to socialism through cooperation. They registered with the district and township governments one after another, requesting to set up agricultural production cooperatives. In some areas, a high tide of mass movement for socialist transformation appeared. According to incomplete statistics, by the spring of 1954, there were 132 mutual aid teams in the county requesting to set up cooperatives. The peasants who requested to set up cooperatives went to the old cooperatives on the first day of the Lunar New Year to "visit teachers and seek advice," and some carried dry food to Xin Deng, Fuyang and other counties to learn from the experience of setting up cooperatives. In principle, at this time, we already had two years of successful experience in trying out cooperatives, and we had the conditions to lead this mass movement. However, we still did not feel the gradually rising socialist enthusiasm of the masses, and we still did not understand how to realize the Party's general line during the transition period in concrete work, and we still did not meet the needs of the peasants. Only nine new cooperatives were established under leadership this year, and the peasants spontaneously established eleven, with a total of twenty-two new and old cooperatives in the county. 351 peasant households joined the cooperatives, accounting for only 1.3 percent of the total number of peasant households. As a result of the autumn harvest distribution, all the cooperatives increased production compared to the local general mutual aid teams and individual farmers, and the members also increased their income. All cooperatives increased production by more than 15 percent compared to 1953. Guangming Cooperative in Guangming Township increased production by 49 percent. These cooperatives were all consolidated. This was a powerful call to the vast number of peasants to take the road of cooperation, and it also provided the leadership with a relatively complete experience in leading the cooperative movement. Therefore, by the autumn of 1954, after further implementing the publicity and education of the general line, the agricultural cooperation movement had a great leap forward. In the first 20 days of October alone, 380 new cooperatives were established in the county, more than 17 times the original number of cooperatives. The 22 old cooperatives were also expanded. 16,555 peasant households joined the cooperatives, accounting for 57.7 percent of the total number of peasant households in the county, an increase of more than 46 times compared to the original number of households. At the same time, an advanced cooperative with a completely socialist nature was established, with 173 members. The remaining cooperatives averaged 41 households per cooperative. Of the 38 townships and towns in the county, 27 had achieved basic cooperation. The vast majority of these newly established cooperatives had a mutual aid foundation of three to four years, and only six cooperatives were established by individual farmers; in terms of leadership backbone, 202 cooperatives had strong leadership backbone, and the remaining 100 cooperatives had weaker leadership backbone, but the vast majority were promising for training; in terms of the process of establishing cooperatives, 290 cooperatives were established with leadership and planning, accounting for 76 percent of the total number of cooperatives, and only 24 percent of the cooperatives had more problems due to insufficient preparation for establishing cooperatives. The above situation shows that the great development of the cooperative movement in our county after last autumn was basically normal and healthy.
    Of course, in the process of the great development of cooperation, some shortcomings and errors were also produced, mainly that the development work in some areas was done relatively roughly. For example, Xilin, Yangling and other townships put forward the requirement of "cooperation within a time limit of ten days," Hengban District put forward inappropriate slogans such as "burning your bottom, spurring your horse," and Tingzi District put forward "adopting the crash method," which led to some phenomena of coercion and commandism in the establishment of cooperatives; the mutual benefit policy was not implemented completely enough, and some cooperatives infringed upon the interests of middle peasants. But these were only local phenomena that occurred in the course of progress. Those who had opinions on the movement were only a small number of rich peasants who were unwilling to join the cooperatives. More than 90 percent of the peasants who joined the cooperatives were happy and actively supported the movement. If the leadership could correctly analyze these situations and strengthen the work from a positive perspective and rectify it in a planned way, at least 95 percent of the cooperatives could be consolidated. However, we lacked a correct analysis of the overall situation of the movement, and in April and May, when some tension arose in the countryside, we blindly believed that it was caused by the great development of cooperation. In the face of the clamor of a few rich peasants, our leading organs showed panic and exaggerated the shortcomings of the movement. Therefore, we adopted the incorrect policy of "all-out consolidation, resolute contraction" for agricultural cooperatives, and in specific work, we used the main force to engage in "contraction." Under the guidance of this wrong policy, some areas looked for the shortcomings of agricultural cooperatives from all aspects as an excuse for the cooperatives to "reorganize." The leading staff of Banqiao Township wanted to change Qiaotou Agricultural Cooperative into a mutual aid team, but they could not find any shortcomings of this cooperative, so they used the fact that this cooperative "did not irrigate the fields well" as the only reason to force this cooperative to change into a mutual aid team. Some places also mobilized party members to take the lead in withdrawing from the cooperatives. After Gao Hong Township failed to mobilize Caiwu Agricultural Cooperative to let the cooperative chairman take the lead in withdrawing from the cooperative, it convened a meeting and ordered the dissolution of the cooperative. Some places even publicized the benefits of withdrawing from the cooperative, and relied on middle peasants who were unwilling to join the cooperative as activists, and let them lead the members to change the cooperative into a mutual aid team. Under this kind of wrong practice of both mobilizing and forcing, 82 agricultural cooperatives were dissolved in the county, accounting for 21.5 percent of the total number of cooperatives. The big cooperatives were also divided into smaller ones. 5,743 peasant households in the county withdrew from the cooperatives and switched to mutual aid teams. Among them, 56 percent of the households were rich peasants, who were generally not completely willing to join the cooperatives in the first place, and they should be allowed to withdraw from the cooperatives if they wanted to; but 44 percent of the households were poor peasants who actively requested to join the cooperatives, and it was very wrong to force them to withdraw from the cooperatives.
    The result of dissolving agricultural cooperatives on a large scale caused significant losses to the socialist transformation of agriculture in Lin'an County. First of all, it greatly dampened the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. For example, Pan Lianghua, a party member and old activist in Jinyuan Township, was very excited when he heard that this township could basically realize cooperation in three years when he was publicizing the general line. He actively set up a "big joint group," and then turned it into a cooperative. In May, because he had to implement the policy of "resolute contraction," the district and township leaders planned to dissolve his cooperative, and he resolutely disagreed. The township party organization used the method of "checking the organizational attitude of implementing the party committee's resolutions" to force him to agree, and finally dissolved the cooperative. Pan Lianghua became discouraged from then on. Although he was nominated and elected as the township head, he has not publicized agricultural cooperation to the masses for four months. Secondly, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and rural capitalist forces took the opportunity to raise their heads and attack socialism. They cursed agricultural cooperatives and attacked activists. For example, Ma Jinxiang, an old middle peasant in Qingshan Township, bought wine, meat, and cigarettes after withdrawing from the cooperative, and sarcastically said to Wang Yuanlai, the chairman of the cooperative and the director of the village peasant association: "Director Wang, look, if you don't withdraw from the cooperative, where would you get these things to eat?" Many rich peasants, after joining the cooperative, relied on the strength of the cooperative to change to planting double-cropping rice. When the early rice was about to be harvested, they used "freedom of withdrawal" as an excuse to request withdrawal from the cooperative, attempting to encroach on the fruits of collective labor in the cooperative. Thirdly, it affected the realization of agricultural production increase plans. Originally, the county planned to change to planting more than 63,000 mu of double-cropping rice according to the original cooperative plan. After dissolving agricultural cooperatives on a large scale, the strength to change the cropping system was greatly weakened, and only 49,000 mu were completed. Calculating the minimum increase of 150 jin of rice per mu of double-cropping rice compared to single-cropping rice, a total of more than 2 million jin of rice was lost. In addition, due to the withdrawal of a large number of cooperative members and the transfer of means of production and production investment, it caused difficulties in settling accounts for agricultural cooperatives and caused confusion in accounts, seriously affecting the production mood of cooperative members. The peasant masses were very dissatisfied with the practice of "resolute contraction." The masses in Hengxi Township criticized the work team engaged in "contraction" work as "drivers of reversing cars." The masses in Hengban Town said: The work team brought evil spirits to the countryside. These criticisms from the masses were righteous and stern, and they pointed out the serious harm of implementing this wrong policy very aptly. However, we were "dizzy with victory" at the time, and we were not educated by these criticisms and accusations from the masses. Chairman Mao taught us that we should cherish any small socialist enthusiasm of peasants and cadres, and should not frustrate it; and he also taught us to "share the fate and breathe the same air" with the members and cadres of the cooperative, but we intentionally or unintentionally frustrated the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses in many ways, causing significant losses in our work. Looking back now, this lesson is very painful.
    Although the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Lin'an County has taken many detours in the past, under the promotion of the masses and the timely guidance of the higher authorities, the achievements of the work are still great. Now, there are 371 agricultural cooperatives in the county, with 11,348 members, accounting for 39.54 percent of the total number of peasant households. These cooperatives have been basically consolidated after rectification, and they have all increased production to varying degrees. More than 300 county, district, and township rural staff members have gained experience in establishing and consolidating cooperatives to varying degrees; more than 5,000 activists among the peasant masses have been trained to become the backbone force of the cooperative movement. This is the basic guarantee for realizing agricultural cooperation in the county's rural areas in the future. Recently, we conducted a bottom-up survey of the dynamics of cooperation among farmers at all levels in key townships, and it is estimated that 61.4 percent of the county's farmers are actively requesting cooperation. It can be predicted that after the central government and Chairman Mao's instructions on cooperation are conveyed, the county's farmers will be greatly encouraged, and the upsurge of cooperation will be even higher. We must accept past experiences and lessons, and with the most firm confidence and determination, follow the central government's policy of "overall planning, strengthening leadership," and prepare and plan to welcome the arrival of a new high tide of socialist mass movement.

    接受教训，迎接合作化运动的新高涨
    中共浙江省临安县委书记　王茂松
    最近学习了中央和毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示，对照检查了我们浙江省临安县互助合作运动发展的历史，深深感到毛主席的指示是完全正确的。几年来，临安县的互助合作运动一直是在向前迈进的，但领导工作总是跟不上运动的发展。中央和毛主席的指示给了我们深刻的教育，使我们认识了领导工作中所存在的右倾错误，鼓起了我们领导群众向社会主义道路前进的勇气。
    临安县在一九五一年春天完成土地改革以后，党组织就号召农民组织起来发展生产。农民群众积极响应了党的号召，第一年就组织了八百三十七个互助组。入组农民三千多户，占全县总农户百分之十点五。这一年的互助组虽然还是临时变工性质的互助组，但是不少农民已从中体验到了“组织起来”的优越性；一九五二年春天，有的互助组就要求提高一步办农业生产合作社。这是我们领导方面事先不曾预料到的，所以当农民自发地建起了社，我们才跟上去加以领导，建立了一个农业生产合作社。这个社有九户社员，九十四亩水田，办社第一年，每亩产量就从互助组时的四百七十斤提高到六百三十四斤，创造了全县增产的最高纪录。这个事实教育了广大农民，使他们开始看到了农业合作化是通向富裕的道路。到了一九五三年春天，就有成批的互助组要求建立农业生产合作社。但我们由于对群众的觉悟程度和党的领导力量认识不足，虽然也通过各种形式宣传了农业合作社的优越性，却没有在实际工作上满足群众的要求，只是又重点试办了一个社。许多要求转社的互助组因为不能转社，便办起了“黑社”，取名为“包工包产”互助组，实际上是土地统一经营的农业生产合作社。全县一共办了二十个。这些社实行土地统一经营以后，生产上立即出现了新气象，社员收入显著增加。如杨岭乡的一个“包工包产”互助组，光在夏收预分中，每个劳动日就分到了十六斤谷。可是，当年夏收以后，临安县盲目反对“急躁冒进”，竟把这些农民积极分子花了几个月功夫，辛辛苦苦办起来的社解散了。一九五三年冬天，全县大张旗鼓地宣传了党在过渡时期的总路线，广大农民看到了社会主义的幸福远景，热烈向往着通过合作化走向社会主义的道路，纷纷向各区乡政府报名挂号，要求办农业生产合作社。若干地区出现了社会主义改造的群众运动的高潮。据不完全的统计，到一九五四年春天，全县要求办社的互助组已有一百三十二个。要求办社的农民，在大年初一就到老社去“访师求教”，有的背着干粮到新登、富阳等县去学习办社经验。按道理，这时我们已有了两年试办合作社成功的经验，领导这个群众运动是具备了条件的。但是我们还感觉不到逐步高涨起来的群众的社会主义热情，还不明确怎样从具体工作上去实现党在过渡时期的总路线，仍然没有满足农民的要求。这年有领导地建立起来的新社只有九个，农民又自发地办了十一个，全县新、老社一共有二十二个。入社农户三百五十一户，只占总农户的百分之一点三。秋收分配的结果，全部社都比当地一般互助组和单干农民增加了生产，社员也都增加了收入。全部社比一九五三年增产一成五以上。光明乡光明社增产达四成九。这批社全部巩固下来了。这对广大农民走合作化道路是一个有力的号召，也给领导方面提供了领导合作化运动的较完整的经验。因此，到一九五四年秋天，在进一步贯彻了总路线的宣传教育以后，农业合作化运动有了飞跃的发展。仅十月的头二十天内，全县办起了新社三百八十个，为原有社的十七倍多。二十二个老社也扩大了。全县入社农户一万六千五百五十五户，占全县农户总数的百分之五十七点七，比原来入社的户数增加了四十六倍多。同时，还办起了一个完全社会主义性质的高级社，社员一百七十三户。其余的社平均每社四十一户。全县三十八个乡、镇中，有二十七个实现了基本合作化。这一大批新办起来的社，从互助基础上看，绝大部分有三年至四年的互助基础，由单干户办起来的社只有六个；从领导骨干上看，有二百零二个社的领导骨干是坚强的，其余一百多个社领导骨干较弱，但绝大部分都是有培养前途的；从建社过程上看，有领导有计划地办起来的社是二百九十个，占总社数的百分之七十六，只有百分之二十四的社由于建社准备不够，问题较多些。以上情况，说明我县去年秋后合作化运动的大发展，基本上是正常的，健康的。
    当然，在合作化大发展的工作过程中，也产生了若干缺点和错误，主要是部分地区的发展工作做得比较粗糙。如西林、杨岭等乡提出了“限期十天合作化”的要求，横畈区提出了“火烧屁股，催马加鞭”、亭子区提出了“采取速成法”等不恰当的口号，以致在建社中发生了一些强迫命令的现象；互利政策也贯彻得不够完整，有些社侵犯了中农利益。但这都只是前进中发生的局部现象。对运动有意见的，只是少数不自愿入社的富裕农民，百分之九十以上的入社农民，对运动都是兴高采烈的，积极拥护的。如果领导上能够正确地分析这些情况，从积极方面去加强工作，有计划地加以整顿，起码有百分之九十五以上的社是能够巩固的。可是，我们对整个运动的情况缺乏正确的分析，四、五月间，当农村中产生某些紧张情况的时候，便盲目地认为是合作化的大发展所引起的。在少数富裕农民的叫嚣前面，我们领导机关表现了惊惶失措，夸大了运动中的缺点。于是，对农业合作社采取了“全力巩固，坚决收缩”的不正确方针，而在具体工作中，又以主要力量去搞“收缩”。部分地区在这种错误方针的指导之下，从各方面去寻找农业合作社的缺点，作为让社“改组”的借口。板桥乡的领导工作人员要把桥头农业合作社改为互助组，但又找不出这个社的缺点，就把这个社“田水未灌好”这一点作为唯一的理由，强迫这个社改成了互助组。有的地方还动员党员带头退社。高虹乡在动员蔡坞农业合作社社长带头退社不成功以后，就召开大会下命令把社解散了。有的地方甚至宣传退社的好处，并把不自愿入社的中农作为积极分子来依靠，由他们带动社员把社改成互助组。在这种种连动员带逼迫的错误作法之下，全县解散了八十二个农业合作社，占总社数的百分之二十一点五。大社也被划小了。全县退社转组的农户五千七百四十三户。其中有百分之五十六的户是富裕农民，这些户一般的原来入社就不完全自愿，他们愿意退社当然应该听其自便；但有百分之四十四的户是积极要求入社的贫困农民，逼迫他们退社就十分错误了。
    大批解散农业合作社的结果，使临安县的农业的社会主义改造事业遭受了重大的损失。首先是大大挫伤了干部和群众的社会主义积极性。如金源乡党员、老积极分子潘良华，在宣传总路线的时候，听说这个乡三年内可以基本上实现合作化，他十分兴奋，积极办起了“大联组”，接着又转成社。五月间，因为要执行“坚决收缩”的方针，区、乡领导计划要解散他这个社，他坚决不同意。乡党组织就用“检查执行党委决议的组织态度”的办法，强迫他同意，终于把社解散了。潘良华从此心灰意冷，虽然被提选为乡长，但四个月来，他一直不曾向群众宣传农业合作化。其次是地主、富农、反革命分子及农村资本主义势力乘机抬头，向社会主义进攻。他们咒骂农业合作社，打击积极分子。如青山乡老中农马金相退社以后，买了酒肉、香烟，拿到社长、村农会主任王元来面前讽刺地说：“王主任，你看看，不退社的话，这些东西哪里有得吃？”不少富裕农民，入社后依靠社的力量改种了双季稻，到早稻即将丰收的时候，就以“退社自由”为借口，要求退社，企图侵吞社内集体劳动的成果。再次是影响了农业增产计划的实现。原来全县按原有社计划，改种双季稻六万三千多亩，大批解散农业合作社以后，大大削弱了改变耕作制的力量，只完成了四万九千亩。以每亩双季稻比单季稻最低增产稻谷一百五十斤计算，共损失稻谷二百多万斤。此外，由于大批社员退社转组，带出生产资料和生产投资，造成农业合作社结算账目的困难，发生账目混乱现象，严重地影响了社员的生产情绪。农民群众对“坚决收缩”的作法是十分不满的。横溪乡群众批评搞“收缩”工作的工作组是“开倒车的司机”。横畈镇群众说：工作组把邪气带到农村来了。群众的这些批评是义正辞严的，它十分中肯地指出了执行这种错误方针的严重危害性。但是我们当时却被“胜利吓昏了头脑”，并没有从群众的这些批评指责中受到教育。毛主席教导我们应当爱惜农民和干部的任何一点微小的社会主义积极性，而不应当去挫折它；又教导我们要和合作社的社员，干部“共命运、同呼吸”，但我们有意无意地从多方面挫折了干部和群众的积极性，造成工作上的重大损失。现在回顾起来，这个教训是十分沉痛的。
    过去临安县的互助合作运动虽然走了不少弯路，但在群众的推动和上级的及时指导下，工作的成绩仍然是很大的。现在，全县有三百七十一个农业合作社，社员一万一千三百四十八户，占总农户百分之三十九点五四。这些社经过整顿以后，基本上都巩固下来了，而且都程度不同地增了产。三百多名县、区、乡农村工作人员，都程度不同地取得了办社和巩固社的经验；五千多名农民群众中的积极分子，已锻炼成为合作化运动的骨干力量。这是今后全县农村实现农业合作化的基本保证。最近，我们在重点乡对农民各阶层对合作化的动态进行了摸底，计全县有百分之六十一点四的农民是积极要求合作化的。可以预计，在中央和毛主席关于合作化的指示传达下去以后，全县农民将受到莫大的鼓舞，合作化的热潮会更加高涨起来。我们要接受过去的经验和教训，以最坚定的信心和决心，遵照中央“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，有准备有计划地迎接新的社会主义群众运动高潮的到来。
