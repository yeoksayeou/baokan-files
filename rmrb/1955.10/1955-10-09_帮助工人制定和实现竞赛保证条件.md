    Helping Workers Formulate and Implement Competition Guarantee Conditions
    Shao Chengzi, Chairman of the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory Trade Union
    In the process of carrying out labor competitions, helping workers formulate and implement individual competition guarantee conditions is an extremely important task for promoting the development of competitions and ensuring the completion of national plans. When workers have formulated competition guarantee conditions, they have specific directions for their efforts and can fully exert their enthusiasm and creativity to complete their tasks outstandingly. For example, Li Yongshun, a fourth-grade milling machine operator at the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, has been formulating guarantee conditions on a monthly basis since March 1954. In one year, he has transformed 17 types of cutting tools and fixtures and mastered rapid cutting methods. In 1954, he completed the workload of one year and eleven months. By August of this year, he had completed ten months and twenty days of work. Therefore, he was named a municipal industrial labor model. Such deeds are no longer isolated cases in our factory. At present, more than 90 percent of the production workers with quotas can formulate individual guarantee conditions according to planned targets. This ensures the timely completion of the national plan. Taking 1954 as an example, our factory completed 107.39 percent of the total output value, 104.16 percent of the total commodity value, 100 percent of the variety plan, 125.25 percent of the profit plan, reduced costs by 2.35 percent compared with the plan, and completed 108.11 percent of labor productivity. The second quarter of this year also comprehensively completed the plan. Looking at the growth figures of labor productivity, August increased by 43.7 percent compared with January.
    In our factory, formulating individual competition guarantee conditions has become an obligation that all employees must fulfill at the beginning of each month. For example, in the casting and woodworking workshop: the workshop planning team sends the planned targets to the work section on the 25th of the previous month, and the work section distributes the specific plans to the workers before the 30th; when various targets are delivered to individuals, the workshop trade union and administrative leaders hold various special meetings to analyze the key problems and weak links in the month's production and propose measures and methods to solve the problems; on this basis, they specifically assign tasks to help production workers carefully calculate according to the targets, and formulate conditions for guaranteeing the completion of the plan before the 5th of the month. At the beginning of 1954, only five workers in the factory made guarantee conditions. At present, most workers can carry out this work on time and are formulating guarantee conditions for teams and work sections on the basis of individual guarantee conditions.
    Individual competition guarantee conditions are formulated based on various indicators of the national plan, such as output, labor productivity, waste product losses, etc. None of the indicators can be missing, otherwise it will be difficult to comprehensively complete the national plan.
    Helping workers formulate individual guarantee conditions is a very complex task. We should constantly cultivate various models and establish banners. At the beginning of 1954, in order to universally promote this work throughout the factory, we took Li Yongshun and Dong Guanquan from the large parts workshop as models and formulated specific guarantee conditions, and then promoted them throughout the factory, which smoothly carried out this work. In October of last year, due to changes in the variety of products produced by our factory and an increase in new product tasks, some jobs had heavy quota tasks, and some jobs had high technical requirements for processing parts. Based on these production characteristics, we summarized the methods and experiences of workers with three different production characteristics, such as lathe operator Sheng Li, milling machine operator Li Yongshun, and driller Huang Genlin, in formulating guarantee conditions, and carried out publicity throughout the factory. Sometimes, because the technical level of some workers is low and they cannot practically formulate specific guarantee conditions, we focus on helping them learn from others. In April of this year, the bushing workshop selected lathe operator Chen Jinxiu and Dai Shihua, who often failed to complete their tasks, as key targets and specifically helped them calculate, resulting in a plan to complete the entire month's task half a day early and achieve a quality of 98 percent. This not only strengthened their confidence in completing the plan but also inspired the enthusiasm of the majority of employees to complete the competition conditions. Some people said: If they can finish half a day early, what reason do we have not to finish early!
    In July of this year, we inspected the guarantee conditions of production workers in several workshops and found that many people's orders were not specific. Some only wrote "Strive to complete." The workshop trade union staff thought ideologically, "We have no way to do it. The tasks are heavy every month, and it is difficult to mobilize the masses. It is better to order than not to order." In order to reverse this formalism, we focused on helping Ding Zhaolan and Wang Shijun, lathe operators in the standard parts workshop, and Lian Tongyi's team in the large parts workshop, to revise the plan. This plan has clear measures to complete the plan and practical and feasible guarantee conditions. Then, a conference was held to make a report, and the workshop trade union committee members were organized to study such a plan, calling on all workers in the factory to learn from them. As a result, the workshops mobilized the masses to revise the plan. In the individual plans of the hydraulic workshop, those with specific measures accounted for 40 percent of the number of people who ordered the guarantee plan.
    When helping workers formulate guarantee conditions, we once organized foremen, technicians, and workers with high technical skills to help workers with low technical skills. For example, construction worker Zhou Gongxiang helped third-level lathe operator Li Huiling calculate and solved the problem of water pump processing. The original calculation was one time behind the quota, but after improving the tool, it could exceed the quota by one time, giving Li Huiling confidence in completing the task.
    When formulating individual guarantee conditions, strengthening ideological education work is of particular importance. When we started to launch this work, there were three fears among the workers: first, fear that the job plan would be disrupted; second, fear that the tools would not be effective; and third, fear of not being sure. At this time, we not only publicized to the workers the significance of completing the national plan, but also organized various workshops to introduce in a timely manner some advanced experiences and advanced ideas of breaking through quotas to complete the plan. In the third quarter of this year, the production tasks increased greatly, and some workers had formalism problems when ordering guarantee conditions, which caused everyone to produce
  The idea that "it's the same whether you order or not, you can always complete it if you can, and you can't always complete it if you can't." At that time, the party branch in the workshop conducted education among party members, asking them to take the lead in doing this work, and used blackboard newspapers and broadcasting stations to promote the advanced ideas of advanced workers such as Chen Dingzhang who ordered good guarantee conditions. This made the workers not only know the importance of ordering individual guarantee conditions, but also understood one point: the more specific the guarantee conditions, the more ways to complete the task. For example, the 5408 lathe in the standard parts workshop adopted the following methods when ordering guarantee conditions: 1. Analyze the production characteristics and key points of the month, knowing that there are many new products in July, many processing types, and because the number of pieces is small, the time for calibration is not sure to reach the quota. According to the above characteristics, it is proposed to strive to exceed the quota only, and to put forward specific measures to further solve the difficulties that each piece number cannot reach the quota; 2. Analyze the piece numbers with different characteristics, study and improve the operation method, and calculate the account for each piece number, whether it can exceed the quota? Can it be overdrawn? What is the reason for the negative amount? How to make it not negative? According to the drawing, how many knives should be installed to complete the quota? How to install? What kind of knife to use? How many times to grind the knife? How many cutting procedures? How much is the car speed? How many minutes for each way? This will enable us to propose practical solutions; 3. Propose a plan to improve the operation method. As a result, this lathe completed 480 hours of quota tasks in 400 hours, completing the entire month's production task two days in advance.
    Trade union staff must not think that everything is fine after helping workers order individual competition guarantee conditions. The more important task is how to help workers realize the guarantee conditions. According to our experience, there are several aspects of work that need to be done:
    First, various forms of production meetings are often held to focus on solving key problems and weak links in production, so as not to affect the normal development of labor competition due to the failure to solve certain production problems in a timely manner. In our factory, there are special production meetings to study key problems, same-type production meetings to learn advanced cutting experience, weekly group production meetings to check guarantee conditions, and work section quality meetings to analyze the causes of defective products and propose ways to improve product quality. Although the specific requirements of the meeting are different, it can give play to the enthusiasm and wisdom of workers and technicians, solve key production problems, and this can actually help production workers realize their guarantee conditions.
    Second, take effective measures to strengthen the collaboration and mutual assistance of workshops and groups, and organize the signing of contact contracts between workshops, departments, departments and workshops, and work sections. Because in production, any workshop, group or individual needs the cooperation of others, and if the collaboration is not good, it will be difficult to complete the task on time. Through contact contracts, organizing mutual collaboration can strengthen the overall concept of the masses, make the masses clear about the impact of their work on the work of others and even on the production of the entire factory, and overcome the wrong practice of only caring about themselves and not caring about others.
    Third, in the competition process, widely carry out various forms of publicity and mobilization work. Encourage the advanced, criticize the backward, raise questions in the competition, and point out the direction of efforts. In October and November of last year, the defective products of production workers in several processing workshops were very serious. Because the defective rate greatly exceeded the target, it also affected the failure to comprehensively complete the plan. At this time, we held a "Reduce Defective Products, Guarantee Quality Propaganda Station," pointing out the losses caused to the country by defective products and proposing five ways to complete the quality target. After visiting the workshops, the workers organized discussions and immediately put forward measures to reduce defective products. In propaganda and mobilization work, it is very useful to introduce the experiences of advanced producers to the whole factory. We have successively introduced the experiences of labor model Sheng Li completing more than one year's production task in six and a half months, and driller Huang Genlin not producing defective products in sixteen months. Each workshop can also pay attention to timely publicizing the achievements of workers who have completed the plan well. For those who cannot keep up with the schedule in the competition, we also criticize him through blackboard newspapers or big-character posters, while pointing out the direction of efforts.
    In order to achieve greater results, administrative departments and offices should be absorbed to participate in this work, relying on them to supply propaganda materials, and through various lively, vivid and easy-to-understand forms such as "Propaganda Station," "Illustrated Magazine," "Broadcast," "Blackboard Newspaper," "Big-Character Poster," and "Exhibition," timely carry out the education of completing the national plan to all employees in the factory. In April of this year, we held a new product exhibition, explaining through physical objects the process of the machine tool factory from manufacturing simple agricultural tools before liberation to manufacturing precision grinding machines at present, explaining that the new products of our factory have supported the basic construction of more than 1,000 factories and mines, and some products have been exhibited in more than a dozen countries, what difficulties have been encountered in the manufacturing of each new product and its solution process (including who solved it), and what are the existing shortcomings, etc. This exhibition gave the workers a profound education.
    Fourth, in the competition process, the results of the realization of the plan should be announced on schedule. Now, our factory newspaper publishes the progress of the workshop's completion of the plan every three days, and each workshop publishes the progress of the work section and individual's completion of the plan every day, so that workers can know their production results in time and inspire them to continuously catch up with the advanced production level. For example, Qinggong Ji Xuezhou in the casting and woodworking workshop failed to complete the quota task for several consecutive days at the beginning of August, while other workers in this work section exceeded the quota. The competition announcement board pointed out that if he could work harder, he could strive for the full section to exceed the quota. He was very excited after reading it. After encouragement and education from the party branch and trade union in the workshop, he caught up with the progress day by day, and finally made the work section exceed the quota.
    Fifth, in order to better realize the guarantee conditions, it is necessary to learn from the Soviet Union in an organized and purposeful manner and promote various advanced experiences created by the workers of the factory, according to the key problems in production technology and technical difficulties. Under the leadership of the party committee, we will cooperate with the administrative department to propose projects to promote advanced experiences, and specifically help each workshop to order a promotion plan. For example, in July of this year, the drilling capacity of the large parts workshop was weak, so we decided to promote the relevant experience in drilling to ensure the completion of the task.
    At the same time, in addition to regular technical learning of the same type, we also often hold "Cutting Expert Performance Meetings" and "Advanced Experience Teaching Meetings." The trade union hires high-level technical workers to give special lectures on advanced experience operation methods, and invites engineering and technical personnel to participate in tutoring.
    These have powerfully promoted the upsurge of the masses learning advanced experiences. The workers are eager to learn and apply various advanced experiences and actively put forward rationalization proposals.
    After the above work, by the end of August this year, 23 people in the factory had completed the annual workload in advance.

    帮助工人制定和实现竞赛保证条件
    上海机床厂工会主席　邵成滋
    在开展劳动竞赛过程中，帮助工人制定和实现个人竞赛的保证条件，是推动竞赛发展、保证完成国家计划的一项极为重要的工作。职工群众制定了竞赛保证条件，就有了具体的努力方向，就能充分发挥自己的积极性和创造性，出色地完成任务。例如上海机床厂四级铣工李永顺，从一九五四年三月份开始按月制定保证条件，一年中改造刀具、夹具十七种，掌握了快速切削法，在一九五四年完成了一年十一个月的工作量；今年到八月份止，已完成了十个月零二十天的工作量。因而，他被评为市的工业劳动模范。这样的事迹在我们厂已不是个别的了，目前在有定额的生产工人中，已有百分之九十以上都能按计划指标制定个人保证条件。这就保证可以按时完成国家计划。以一九五四年为例，我们厂生产总值完成百分之一○七点三九、商品总值完成百分之一○四点一六、品种计划完成百分之百、利润计划完成百分之一二五点二五、成本比计划降低了百分之二点三五、劳动生产率完成了百分之一○八点一一。今年第二季度也全面完成了计划。从劳动生产率增长数字看，八月份比一月份提高了百分之四十三点七。
    在我们厂里，制定个人的竞赛保证条件，已成为全体职工每月月初必须履行的义务。如铸木车间：车间计划组在上月二十五日把计划指标下到工段，工段在三十日前把具体计划分配到工人；车间工会和行政领导人员当各项指标下达到个人时，即召开各种专题会议，分析当月生产中存在的关键问题和薄弱环节，提出解决问题的措施和办法；在这个基础上具体分工帮助生产工人按指标仔细算账，在当月五日前订出个人保证完成计划的条件。一九五四年初，全厂只有五个工人订保证条件，到目前已有大部分工人能够按时进行这一工作，并正在个人制定保证条件的基础上制定小组、工段的保证条件。
    个人竞赛保证条件，是依据国家计划的各项指标，如产量、劳动生产率、废品亏损等制定出来的。各项指标缺一不可，否则很难全面完成国家计划。
    帮助工人制定个人保证条件，是一项很复杂的工作，应该不断地培养各种典型、树立旗帜。一九五四年初，我们为了在全厂普遍推行这一工作，曾以大件车间李永顺、董关泉为典型，订出具体的保证条件，而后在全厂内推广，较顺利地开展了这一工作。去年十月份，由于我们厂的生产品种有变化，新产品任务增多，产生了有些工种定额任务重、有些工种加工零件技术要求高等现象。我们根据这种生产特点，总结了车工盛利、铣工李永顺、钻工黄根林等三个不同生产特点的工人制定保证条件的方法和经验，在全厂内进行宣传。有时，因某些工人的技术水平低，无法切实地订出具体的保证条件，我们就着重帮助他们向别人学习。今年四月份，轴套车间就选择了经常完不成任务的车工陈锦秀和戴世华为重点，具体帮助她们算账，结果订出了提前半天完成全月任务、质量达到百分之九十八的计划。这不仅坚定了她们完成计划的信心，也启发了广大职工完成竞赛条件的热情，有的人就说：她俩能提前半天，我们还有什么理由不能提前呢！
    今年七月份，我们检查了几个车间生产工人的保证条件，发现有许多人订的不具体，有的只写上“争取完成”。车间工会工作人员思想上认为“我们也没有办法，任务月月重，群众难发动，订总比不订好。”为了扭转这种形式主义的毛病，我们又有重点地帮助标准件车间车工丁兆兰、王世俊和大件车间连桐益小组，修订了计划，在这个计划中有明确的完成计划的措施和切实可行的保证条件。接着，召开大会作报告，组织车间工会委员学习这样的计划，号召全厂工人向他们学习。结果，各车间纷纷发动群众，修订计划。在液压车间的个人计划中有具体措施的占订保证计划人数的百分之四十。
    帮助工人制定保证条件时，我们曾经组织工长、技术员和技术高的工人帮助技术低的工人。如施工员周恭祥，帮助三级车工李惠玲算账，解决了水泵加工的问题，原来计算要比定额落后一倍，改进工具后可超额一倍，使李惠玲有了完成任务的信心。
    在制定个人保证条件时，加强思想教育工作有特别重要的意义。我们开始发动这一工作时，在工人中有三怕：一怕作业计划被打乱、二怕工具不灵、三怕没有把握。这时我们不但向工人宣传完成国家计划的意义，同时还组织各车间及时介绍某些突破定额完成计划的先进经验和先进思想。今年第三季度，生产任务大大地增加了，加之某些工人在订保证条件时有形式主义的毛病，使大家产生了
  “订不订一样，能完成总是完得成，不能完成总是完不成”的思想。当时，车间党的支部在党内向党员进行教育，要他们带头做好这一工作，并运用黑板报、广播台宣传先进工作者陈定章等订好保证条件的先进思想。使工人不仅知道订个人保证条件的重要，而且也明白了一点：保证条件越具体，就越有办法完成任务。例如，标准件车间五四○八车床在订保证条件时，即采取了下列办法：一、分析当月生产特点和关键，知道七月份新产品多、加工种类多、因为件数少校刀时间没把握达到定额。根据上述特点，提出争取只只超额的要求，提出具体措施进一步解决各个件号达不到定额的困难；二、分析不同特点的件号，研究改进操作方法，算出每个件号的账，能否超额？是否可以多超？负额的原因是什么？怎样使它不负额？根据图纸分析应装几把刀才能完成定额？如何装？用什么刀子？磨几次刀？切削程序几道？车速多少？每道几分钟？这样就能提出切合实际的办法；三、提出改进操作方法的计划。结果，这台车床以四百小时完成了四百八十小时的定额任务，提前两天完成全月生产任务。
    工会工作人员，绝不能认为帮助工人订好了个人竞赛保证条件就万事大吉了，更重要的工作还在于如何帮助工人实现保证条件，根据我们的体会，有这几个方面的工作需要做：
    第一，经常召开各种形式的生产会议，在会上着重解决生产中的关键问题和薄弱环节，以免因某些生产问题不能及时解决而影响劳动竞赛的正常发展。在我们厂里有专门研究关键问题的专题生产会议，有学习先进切削经验的同工种生产会议，有每周一次检查保证条件的小组生产会议，有分析废品原因提出改善产品质量办法的工段质量会议。虽然会议的具体要求不同，但是能够发挥工人、技术人员的积极性和智慧，解决生产关键问题，而这实际上能够帮助生产工人实现自己的保证条件。
    第二，采取有效的办法加强车间、小组的协作和互助，组织车间之间、科室之间、科室同车间之间、工段之间签订联系合同。因为在生产中，任何一个车间、小组或个人，都需要别人配合，协作得不好，就很难按时完成任务。通过联系合同，组织相互间的协作，能够加强群众的整体观念，使群众明确自己工作对别人工作以致对全厂生产的影响，克服了只顾自己、不顾别人的错误的做法。
    第三，在竞赛过程中，广泛展开各种形式的宣传鼓动工作。鼓励先进、批评落后、提出竞赛中的问题，指出努力的方向。去年十月和十一月，几个加工车间生产工人的废品很严重，由于废品率大大超过指标，也影响到不能全面完成计划。我们在这时举办了“减少废品，保证质量宣传台”，指出出废品给国家造成的损失，提出完成质量指标的五项办法。各车间工人参观后都组织了讨论，立即提出了减少废品的措施。在宣传鼓动工作中，经常向全厂介绍先进生产者的经验有很大作用。我们先后曾介绍了劳动模范盛利六个半月完成一年多生产任务、钻工黄根林十六个月不出废品等经验。各车间也都能注意及时公布完成计划好的工人的成绩。对于在竞赛中赶不上进度计划的人，我们也通过黑板报或大字报向他提出批评，同时指出努力的方向。
    为取得更大的效果，应吸收行政各科、室参与这个工作，依靠他们供应宣传资料，通过“宣传台”、“画刊”、“广播”、“黑板报”、“大字报”、“展览会”等各种生动活泼、简明易懂的形式，及时向全厂职工进行完成国家计划的教育。今年四月，我们举办了新产品展览会，通过实物说明机床厂由解放前制造简单的农具到目前制造精密磨床的过程，说明我厂的新产品曾支援了一千多个工厂矿山的基本建设，有些产品到十多个国家展览过，每个新产品在制造中遇到过什么困难以及它的解决过程（包括什么人解决的），现在还存在的缺点是什么等。这次展览会使工人受到一次深刻的教育。
    第四，在竞赛过程中，要按期公布实现计划的结果。现在，我们厂厂报每三天公布一次车间完成计划的进度，各车间每天公布工段和个人完成计划的进度，使工人及时知道自己的生产结果，启发他们不断地赶上先进的生产水平。例如铸木车间青工季学周在八月初连续几天未完成定额任务，而这个工段其他工人都是超额的，竞赛公布牌上指出如果他能加把劲就能争取工段满堂超额。他看了非常激动，经车间党支部和工会鼓励教育后，他就一天天地赶上进度，终于使这个工段超额完成了任务。
    第五，要根据生产技术上的关键问题及技术上的困难，有组织、有目的地学习苏联的和推广本厂工人创造出的各种先进经验，运用先进经验更好地实现保证条件。我们在党委领导下会同行政部门提出推广先进经验的项目，具体帮助各车间订出推广计划。如今年七月份大件车间钻工能力弱，我们就决定推广钻工方面有关的经验，以保证完成任务。
    同时，我们除定期的同工种技术学习外，还经常举办“切削能手表演会”“先进经验传授会”，由工会聘请高等级技术工人专题讲解先进经验操作法，并请工程技术人员参加辅导。
    这些，都有力地推动了群众学习先进经验的热潮，工人都迫切地要求学习运用各种先进经验，积极提出合理化建议。
    经过了上述工作，到今年八月底止，全厂已有二十三人提前完成了全年的工作量。
