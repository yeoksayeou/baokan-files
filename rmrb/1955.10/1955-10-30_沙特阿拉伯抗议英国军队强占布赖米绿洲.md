    Xinhua News Agency, October 29th, New York dispatch: Saudi Arabia has filed a complaint with the United Nations Security Council, accusing Britain of aggression, following the occupation of the Buraimi Oasis in the border region between Oman and Saudi Arabia on the 26th by armed forces of the Sultanate of Oman led by British officers.
    The Buraimi Oasis is located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula. According to American and British newspapers, it is rich in oil resources. Oman is a British protectorate. Because Oman and Saudi Arabia do not have a clear border in the Buraimi Oasis region, Britain and Saudi Arabia have repeatedly engaged in armed conflicts over the sovereignty of this area for several years. An agreement to submit the Buraimi Oasis to "arbitration" was signed in July of last year. The arbitration tribunal was composed of representatives from Britain, Saudi Arabia, Belgium, Cuba, and Pakistan. However, the British representative announced his withdrawal in September of this year, when the arbitration tribunal was about to make a decision, thus straining relations between the two sides once again.
    Saudi Arabian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Faisal Al Saud, who is currently visiting Egypt, issued a statement to the press on the 27th regarding the occupation of the Buraimi Oasis. He emphasized, "The Buraimi Oasis is part of Saudi Arabian territory." He said that the occupation of the oasis by British forces "is an act of armed aggression. This British action violates international law and international principles and disregards the treaties it has signed with Saudi Arabia."
    He pointed out that until now, the Saudi Arabian government has been using peaceful methods to resolve the dispute. He said that after the issue was submitted to international arbitration, when Britain felt that the arbitration tribunal was not proceeding in accordance with its colonial interests, its representative withdrew from the tribunal on unreasonable pretexts. Just as Saudi Arabia was waiting for Britain to send another representative, Britain launched an attack on the peaceful Buraimi Oasis. The statement said that Britain has thus exposed its colonial ambitions and proved that its so-called friendly intentions towards Arabs are false.

    沙特阿拉伯抗议英国军队强占布赖米绿洲
    新华社二十九日讯　纽约消息：由于英国军官率领的阿曼酋长国武装部队在二十六日占领了阿曼和沙特阿拉伯边界地区的布赖米绿洲，沙特阿拉伯已经向联合国安全理事会提出控诉，指责英国的行动是侵略行为。
    布赖米绿洲在阿拉伯半岛东部。据美英报刊透露，这里蕴藏着丰富的石油资源。阿曼是英国的保护国。由于阿曼和沙特阿拉伯在布赖米绿洲地区没有明确的边界，英国和沙特阿拉伯为了这块地区的主权问题，几年来曾一再发生武装冲突。去年七月间签订了把布赖米绿洲提交“仲裁”的协定。仲裁法庭由英国、沙特阿拉伯、比利时、古巴和巴基斯坦五国各派一名代表组成。但是英国代表在今年九月间仲裁法庭即将作出决定时宣布退出，从而使双方关系又再度紧张。
    目前在埃及访问的沙特阿拉伯首相兼外交大臣费萨尔·沙特二十七日就布赖米绿洲被占领事件对报界发表了声明。他强调指出：“布赖米绿洲是沙特阿拉伯领土的一部分”。他说：英国军队占领这个绿洲，“是一种武装侵略。英国这一行动破坏了国际法和国际原则，并且无视它同沙特阿拉伯所签订的条约”。
    他指出，到现在为止，沙特阿拉伯政府一直用和平方法解决这个争端。他说，这个问题在提交国际仲裁以后，当英国感到仲裁法庭没有按照它的殖民主义利益进行的时候，它的代表就以无理的借口退出法庭。正当沙特阿拉伯等待英国另派代表的时候，英国却向和平的布赖米绿洲发动了攻击。声明说，英国就这样暴露了它的殖民主义野心，并且证明他们所说的对阿拉伯人的友好意向的话是假的。
