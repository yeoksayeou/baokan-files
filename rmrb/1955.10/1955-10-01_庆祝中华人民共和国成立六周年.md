CPI General Secretary Ghosh Writes Article

    Ajoy Kumar Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, published an article entitled "Greetings to People's China, Defender of Asian Peace" in the latest issue of the "New Century" weekly, celebrating the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
    He wrote: "Today, China, amid the acclamation of its revolutionary victory, has regained its position as one of the greatest countries in the world. India and China stand shoulder to shoulder on the great bastion of Asian peace, playing the role of the most reliable foundation for guaranteeing Asian freedom."
    Ghosh reviewed the victory of the Chinese revolution and its great significance to Asia and the world, and called on everyone to wage a resolute struggle against the imperialists' conspiracies to maintain their rule over Asia. He wrote: "The threat to Asian freedom still exists. The Dutch in West Irian, the Portuguese in Goa, and the US attempts to undermine the hard-won armistices in Korea and Indochina are all indicators of the threats that still lurk.
    "This week, as the United States once again resorts to despicable means to prevent China from obtaining its legitimate seat in the United Nations, one cannot but recognize how stubborn the imperialists' attitude is in refusing to recognize this new reality of a free Asia."
    Ghosh concluded by writing: "As advocated by the Bandung Declaration, the unfinished revolution in Asia must be completed. Only by upholding Asian unity and strengthening this unity through close friendship and cooperation between India and China can hundreds of millions of people make Asia a continent of peace and a pioneer of a new era of freedom."

    “本周，当美国又一次通过卑鄙手段来不让中国取得它在联合国中的合法地位时，人们不得不认识到帝国主义者拒绝承认自由亚洲的这个新现实的态度是多么死硬”。
    高士最后写道：“正如万隆宣言所主张的，亚洲尚未完成的革命必须完成。唯有维护亚洲的团结并通过印中两国的密切的和好关系和合作而加强这种团结，千百万人才能使亚洲成为和平的大陆和自由新纪元的先驱。”（据新华社讯）
