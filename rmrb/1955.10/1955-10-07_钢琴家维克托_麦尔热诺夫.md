    Pianist Viktor Merzhanov
    Viktor Merzhanov was born in the city of Tambov, to an accountant's family. At the age of eight, his parents sent him to a music school. He studied very well. After graduating from a music secondary school, Viktor went to Moscow to enter the Conservatory. He was assigned to the class of the outstanding Soviet teacher and pianist, S. Feinberg.
    Viktor graduated from the Conservatory just as the Great Patriotic War began. A few days after taking his graduation exams, he was drafted into the Soviet army.
    Viktor did not engage in music for four years. He only occasionally played some beloved pieces for his comrades during a few hours of short breaks. After the war, not long before demobilization, Viktor participated in the All-Union Competition of Musicians and Performers. At the competition, this former front-line soldier gave an excellent performance. Merzhanov's genuine artistic passion, freshness, and inspiring power in interpreting Russian composers' works, as well as his simplicity and naturalness during performance, immediately caught the attention of the professors. The competition jury unanimously decided to award Viktor the first prize.
    Thus, Viktor Merzhanov became a pianist again, and his moving musical art brought joy to thousands of people.
    Merzhanov's concerts in some cities of the Soviet Union achieved great success. He also gloriously performed Soviet performing arts in the halls of foreign concert halls in Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Norway, and other countries.
    Viktor Merzhanov, this outstanding Soviet pianist, has been widely recognized as one of the most talented interpreters of the works of Soviet composers.

    钢琴家维克托·麦尔热诺夫
    维克托·麦尔热诺夫生于唐波夫城一个会计员家里。八岁时双亲送他进了音乐学校。他学得很好。接着在音乐专科中学毕业后，维克托到莫斯科考进了音乐学院。他被编入了杰出的苏联教师—钢琴家斯·费茵别尔格的那一班。
    维克托在音乐学院毕业时恰逢伟大卫国战争开始。他在参加了毕业考试以后不多几天就应征加入苏军部队。
    维克托有四年没有从事音乐。他只是间或在短期休息的几小时里给自己的同志们奏一些心爱的作品。战争结束后，在复员以前不久，维克托参加了全苏音乐家—演奏家竞赛会。在竞赛会上，这个不久以前的前线士兵作了出色的演奏。麦尔热诺夫解释俄罗斯作曲家的作品时所表现的真正艺术的激情、清新感和鼓舞力量，以及演奏时的纯朴自然，立刻引起了教授们的注意。竞赛评判委员会一致通过了授予维克托一等奖的决定。
    于是维克托·麦尔热诺夫重新成为钢琴家，他的动人的音乐艺术又给成千上万的人带来了快乐。
    麦尔热诺夫在苏联的一些城市举行的音乐会都获得了巨大成就。他也曾在捷克斯洛伐克、奥地利、匈牙利、挪威等外国音乐会的大厅里光荣地表演过苏联的演奏艺术。
    维克托·麦尔热诺夫这个出色的苏联钢琴家，已被广大人士公认为是苏联作曲家作品的最有天才的解释者之一。
