To Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Beijing:

On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, please accept, esteemed Premier, the most heartfelt congratulations from the government and people of Czechoslovakia, as well as from myself personally.

The people of Czechoslovakia follow with joy the achievements that the great Chinese people are making in building their great motherland, successfully realizing the Five-Year Plan, and continuously raising their material and cultural standards. The increasing international prestige of the People's Republic of China, as well as the growing admiration and love for it from all peace-loving countries, clearly demonstrate the correctness of the policies pursued by the government of the People's Republic of China; this country has consistently fought shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union for peace, for friendly relations between all nations, and for the settlement of all disputes through negotiation. The people of Czechoslovakia will continue to strengthen their unbreakable friendship with the Chinese people through the ever-expanding economic, political, and cultural relations between Czechoslovakia and China. The government of the Czechoslovak Republic will continue to pay due attention to this desire, in order to further strengthen and develop friendship and cooperation between our two countries for the benefit of our two peoples.

Premier Comrade, I wish you and the entire Chinese people many new achievements in the cause of building a people's democratic China.

                          Wiliam Široký, Premier of the Czechoslovak Republic
