Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 12th -- Hunan Province, a renowned rice-producing region, is expected to surpass its rice production increase plan for this year. The province's total rice output may increase by approximately five percent compared to the bumper harvest of 1953. The early and mid-season rice crops have already been harvested, and the late-season rice is generally heading and flowering, promising a good harvest.

The Dongting Lake Plain, which suffered from severe flooding last year, is experiencing a particularly good rice harvest this year. The harvest of early and mid-season rice crops increased by 10% compared to 1953. The good harvest is attributed to the rapid restoration of over 4,000 kilometers of dikes protecting the farmland, under the leadership of the Hunan Provincial Party and government organs and with the economic support of the state, after the floodwaters receded. Furthermore, not only was the original cultivated land fully restored, but more than 180,000 mu of new cultivated land was also developed using ditches and vacant land.

Changing single-season rice to double-season rice is one of the main measures taken to increase production in Hunan Province this year. The province has expanded double-season rice to more than 5.4 million mu, an increase of 40% over last year. To develop double-season rice, many areas have improved water conservancy facilities. This year, the province increased and improved the irrigated area of ​​rice fields by more than 4.7 million mu. The state supplied farmers in double-cropping rice areas with five times more insecticides and equipment than last year. Therefore, the areas along the middle and lower reaches of the Xiangjiang River and the Dongting Lake Plain, which planted double-season rice this year, generally achieved a bumper harvest.

This year, the existing 13,000-plus agricultural producers' cooperatives in Hunan Province took the lead in implementing eight production-increasing measures, such as improving rice fields and uniformly dense planting. Ninety-three percent of the cooperatives increased production as a result. Agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places have also promoted agricultural technology reforms among surrounding farmers, achieving great success. The planting area of ​​improved rice varieties in the province has expanded to more than 12 million mu, an increase of 33% over last year; the planting density has been increased in about 60% of rice fields; and many barren fields have been transformed into fertile fields, and low-yield fields have been transformed into high-yield fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 12th -- Farmers in the western and southern mountainous areas of Hunan Province have reaped a bumper harvest of several thousand mu of dry rice planted this year, and harvesting is underway. The farmers in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture and Tongdao Dong Autonomous County are harvesting more than 1,700 mu of dry rice, with a yield of about 300 jin per mu. The dry rice in some agricultural producers' cooperatives yielded more than 500 jin per mu. The average yield of 168 mu of dry rice in Qianyang County is also nearly 300 jin per mu. The average yield of six mu of dry rice in Zaitou Township of this county was 441 jin per mu. Qin Xuemao, a model agricultural worker, harvested more than 500 jin from one mu of dry rice.

Dry rice has strong drought resistance and is suitable for planting on dry land in mountainous areas. In the past, some farmers in the mountainous areas of Hunan Province planted a small amount of dry rice. This year, the people's government called on farmers in various places to develop production in accordance with local conditions and increase grain production, and the planting of dry rice began to be promoted. Now, the bumper harvest of dry rice has further encouraged farmers' confidence in increasing production. Farmers in various places are harvesting while selecting and reserving seeds in preparation for expanding the planting area of ​​dry rice next year. Farmers who did not plant dry rice this year are also exchanging seeds with farmers who harvested dry rice. (Attached picture)

### 湖南省今年稻谷丰收可超额完成增产计划

    湖南省今年稻谷丰收可超额完成增产计划
    新华社长沙十二日电　著名的水稻产区湖南省预计可以超额完成今年稻谷增产计划。全省稻谷总产量可比丰收的一九五三年增加约百分之五。现在早稻、中稻已先后收割完毕，晚稻也普遍抽穗扬花，丰收在望。
    去年遭大水袭击的洞庭湖滨平原，今年水稻收成特别好，早稻和中稻的收获量比一九五三年增加了一成。水稻所以得到丰收，是由于大水退后，当地农民在湖南省党、政机关的领导下，在国家的经济支援下，首先迅速修复了保卫农田的四千多公里长的堤防，然后不仅全部恢复了原有耕地的生产，还利用沟港隙地扩大了十八万多亩新的耕地。
    变单季稻为双季稻，是今年湖南省增产的主要措施之一。全省双季稻已扩大到五百四十多万亩，比去年增加百分之四十。为了发展双季稻，许多地区改善了水利设施。今年全省增加和改善稻田灌溉面积达四百七十多万亩。国家供应双季稻地区农民的杀虫药剂和药械比去年多五倍。因此今年种植双季稻的湘江中、下游两岸和洞庭湖滨平原，普遍获得丰收。
    今年湖南省原有的一万三千多个农业生产合作社带头实行了改良稻田、均匀密植等八项增产措施，有百分之九十三的社因此增产。各地农业生产合作社还推动周围农民进行农业技术改革，取得很大成就。全省水稻良种的种植面积扩大到一千二百多万亩，比去年增加百分之三十三；大约有百分之六十的稻田增加了插秧的密度；还有不少瘦田变成肥田，低产田变成高产田。
    新华社长沙十二日电　湖南省西部和南部山区农民今年试种的几千亩陆稻丰收，收割工作正在紧张进行。湘西苗族自治州和通道侗族自治县农民正在收割的一千七百多亩陆稻，每亩产量都在三百斤左右。部分农业生产合作社的陆稻，每亩产量达到五百斤以上。黔阳县一百六十八亩陆稻每亩平均产量也近三百斤。这个县的寨头乡有六亩陆稻平均每亩收四百四十一斤。农业劳动模范覃学茂的一亩陆稻收了五百多斤。
    陆稻抗旱能力强，适宜在山区旱地上种植。湖南省山区过去就有一些农民种植小量陆稻，今年人民政府号召各地农民因地制宜发展生产，增产粮食，陆稻的种植开始得到推广。现在，陆稻丰收进一步鼓舞了农民增产的信心。各地农民正一边收获，一边选留种子，准备明年扩大陆稻的种植面积。今年没有种植陆稻的农民，也纷纷向收了陆稻的农民兑换种子。（附图片）
