Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Northern Heilongjiang and Northern Jiangsu regions are seeing generally good rice harvests; highland barley and millet in Hebei province, and rice in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hunan province, have all surpassed last year's output.

Heilongjiang province is experiencing a bumper rice harvest, with average yields reaching over 3,500 kilograms per hectare. This year, Heilongjiang province constructed many small-scale water conservancy projects; according to statistics from twenty counties alone, over 300 small-scale water conservancy projects were renovated, expanded, and newly built this year. The province opened up 26,000 hectares of new paddy fields due to water conservancy construction, exceeding the original plan by 2,000 hectares. Many agricultural production cooperatives have made opening up paddy fields one of the main aspects of increasing production. In the Hejiang area, 350 agricultural production cooperatives built 76 small-scale water conservancy projects this year, opening up a large number of paddy fields. The paddy field yields of agricultural production cooperatives in various places are very high. In the tenth district of Huachuan County, the 3,600 hectares of rice planted by agricultural production cooperatives yielded an average of 5,000 kilograms per hectare. The Qunying Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chunsheng Village, Muling County, harvested an average of over 5,300 kilograms per hectare on its 25 hectares of rice.

This year, the over 666,666 hectares of rice in the Lixiahe region of Jiangsu province have yielded an unprecedented bumper harvest, estimated to produce 2 billion kilograms of rice, a 20% increase over the bumper year of 1953. This is due to the effectiveness of the Hongze Lake reservoir project and the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, which were built during the Huai River control project. The continuous development of the irrigation system has created favorable conditions for increased agricultural production in northern Jiangsu. Over the past two years, along the Irrigation Main Canal and the Liyun River, water sources have been abundant and well-controlled, and 20,000 hectares of single-season rice fields have been converted to double-cropping rice-wheat fields, and dry land has been converted to rice cultivation. After this year's autumn harvest, farmers, seeing the significant effectiveness of the water conservancy projects, have formulated production reform plans. In the next two years, six counties including Baoying and Gaoyou will convert 49,333 hectares of single-season rice fields to double-cropping rice-wheat fields. Three counties including Huaiyin and Huaian will convert 18,000 hectares of dry land to rice cultivation, with an estimated increase of over 100 kilograms of grain per mu.

Farmers in Hebei province have now mostly harvested highland barley, millet, beans, and other crops, and are busily transporting and threshing them, and it is estimated that the autumn harvest will be completed by the end of October. According to surveys and estimates, the harvests of twelve counties and banners will be higher than last year. Among them, the total grain output of four counties will be more than 30,000 tons higher than last year. This year, farmers in Hebei province waged a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters, enabling most areas to win a bumper harvest. Twelve counties and banners built more than 10,000 temporary flood control projects this summer, which played a great role in avoiding flood disasters. This summer, farmers in various places also actively watered and combated drought using all water sources. Eighteen counties and banners irrigated more than 22,666 hectares of land. Farmers in some areas lacking water sources used diligent hoeing, fine hoeing, and multiple hoeing methods to promote the rise of moisture in the ground and enhance the drought resistance of crops.

The more than 46,666 hectares of rice in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture can yield an average of over 200 kilograms per mu, estimated to be about 10% higher than in 1954, exceeding the original production plan by 100%. This year, under the leadership of more than 1,000 agricultural production cooperatives throughout the autonomous prefecture, farmers of all ethnic groups actively improved farming techniques, and rice seeds selected with salt water or yellow mud water accounted for more than 60% of the sown area. Appropriate close planting was also carried out in these fields, which greatly increased the yield per unit area.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, October 11th: Farmers in many areas of Hunan province are paying attention to careful harvesting and gleaning, and it is estimated that the province can harvest more than 125 million kilograms of rice as a result. Before harvesting, many agricultural production cooperatives in various places took the lead in formulating careful harvesting and gleaning covenants, requiring light cutting and placing, and light lifting and heavy beating. During the harvest, the Communist Youth League organizations in rural areas actively mobilized children to pick up fallen rice grains. In the Guandu district of Shimen County, seven townships organized a total of 48 grain-picking shock teams, with 249 children participating. They have already picked up 1,120 kilograms of scattered rice grains from the fields. Some areas have carried out rush harvesting in rainy conditions, and the harvesting is relatively rough. Farmers in these areas have begun to turn over and beat the rice stalks to try to bring all the grains home. Thirteen agricultural production cooperatives in the Jubaoxiang district of Changde County, near Dongting Lake, took the lead in turning over and beating rice stalks. Generally, each mu can yield an additional 3 to 5 kilograms of rice, and the entire township can harvest an additional 16,833 kilograms.

    黑龙江苏北等地稻谷普遍丰收
    湖南农民精打细收可多收稻谷两亿多斤
    据新华社讯　黑龙江和苏北地区水稻普遍丰收；热河省的高粱、谷子和湖南省湘西苗族自治州的稻谷也都超过去年产量。
    黑龙江省水稻丰收，每公顷平均产量达七千斤以上。今年，黑龙江省修建了许多小型水利工程，仅据二十个县的统计，今年整顿、扩建和新修的小型水利工程就有三百多处。全省因兴修水利而新开水田二万六千公顷，超过原定计划二千公顷。许多农业生产合作社把开水田当成增产的主要内容之一。合江专区有三百五十个农业生产合作社今年修了七十六处小型水利工程，开了大量的水田。各地农业生产合作社的稻田产量都很高。桦川县第十区由农业生产合作社种植的三千六百公顷水稻，平均每公顷产一万斤。穆棱县纯盛村群英农业生产合作社的二十五公顷水稻，平均每公顷产一万零六百多斤。
    今年，江苏省里下河地区一千多万亩水稻空前丰收，估计可收四十亿斤稻谷，比丰收的一九五三年增产二成。这是治淮工程中修建的洪泽湖蓄洪工程、苏北灌溉总渠等工程所起的效益。灌溉系统的不断发展，为苏北农业的增产创造了有利条件。两年多来，沿灌溉总渠和里运河两岸，水源充足，控制得宜，先后有三十万亩一熟稻田改为稻麦两熟田，旱田改种了水稻。今年秋收后，农民们看到水利工程所起的显著效用，纷纷拟订生产改革计划。在今后两年内，宝应、高邮等六个县将有七十四万亩一熟稻田改为稻麦两熟田。淮阴、淮安等三个县将有二十七万亩旱田改种水稻，每亩预计可增产粮食二百斤以上。
    热河省农民目前已把高粱、谷子、豆子等庄稼大部割完，正在紧张进行拉运和脱粒，预计十月下旬可以全部结束秋收。据调查估计，有十二个县、旗的收成能高过去年。其中四个县的粮食总产量可比去年多三万吨以上。今年热河省农民和各种自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争，使大部地区赢得了丰收。有十二个县、旗在今年夏季共修建了各种临时防洪工程一万多处，对免除洪水灾害起了很大的作用。今夏各地农民又利用一切水源，积极浇水抗旱。十八个县、旗共浇地三万四千多公顷。有些缺乏水源地区的农民用勤铲、细铲和多铲的办法，促使地里水分上升，增强了庄稼的抗旱能力。
    湘西苗族自治州七十多万亩稻谷平均每亩能收四百多斤，估计比一九五四年增产百分之十左右，超过了原订生产计划的一倍。今年自治州各族农民在全州一千多个农业生产合作社带动下，积极改进了耕作技术，采用盐水或黄泥水选种的稻种占播种面积的百分之六十以上，这些田中还进行了适当密植，大大提高了单位面积产量。
    据新华社长沙十一日电　湖南省许多地区农民注意细打细收，全省预计因此可多收稻谷两亿五千多万斤。在收割前，各地很多农业生产合作社带头订出细打细收公约，要求做到轻割轻放，轻举重打。在收割中，农村中的青年团组织纷纷发动少年儿童拣拾遗落的稻谷。石门县官渡区的七个乡共组织四十八个拣粮突击队，有二百四十九个少年儿童参加，他们已从田里拣回抛散的稻谷二千二百四十斤。有些地区在雨多的情况下进行抢收，收割比较粗糙，这些地区的农民已开始翻打稻秆，争取颗粒还家。洞庭湖滨的常德县聚宝乡十三个农业生产合作社带头翻打稻秆，一般每亩可多收稻谷六斤到十斤，全乡可多收三万三千六百多斤。
