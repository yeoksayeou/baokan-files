Xinhua News Agency, Margate, October 11th: According to TASS, the 54th Annual Conference of the British Labour Party opened in Margate on the 10th. A total of 1,246 delegates from 685 trade unions, cooperative societies, and local organizations affiliated with the Labour Party are participating in the conference.

    The summary report submitted by the Labour Party Executive Committee to the annual conference stated that the Labour Party's membership has decreased in the past three years. In 1954, the Labour Party had a total of 933,657 members, 80,867 fewer than in 1953. The report also addressed the Labour Party's defeat in the last parliamentary election. The subcommittee responsible for investigating organizational work, established by the Executive Committee, believes in its report that this defeat was caused by shortcomings in organizational work. However, ordinary Labour Party members, based on resolutions from local organizations and newspaper commentaries, believe that the main reason for the election defeat was that the Labour Party's right-wing leaders abandoned socialist principles and adopted policies in domestic and foreign affairs that were of the same nature as those of the Conservative Party.

    A total of 418 proposals and 115 amendments to these proposals were submitted to the Labour Party's annual conference for discussion. The organizing committee canceled some proposals that were the same as other proposals and merged some proposals into 38 mixed proposals.

    At the beginning of the meeting on the morning of the 10th, the chairman of the Labour Party Executive Committee, Mr. Samuelskir, delivered a speech as usual. Then, after listening to the Organizing Committee's report on the proposals, some delegates protested that their proposals had not been included on the agenda. Representatives of the Joiners' Union expressed dissatisfaction that only seven of the fifty-two proposals concerning the Labour Party's future policies were included on the agenda.

    The meeting then discussed the issue of Labour Party policy, and the annual conference first discussed the proposal put forward by the Govan (Lanarkshire) local organization. This proposal stated that the Labour Party's task should be to build socialism. The proposal advocated nationalizing key industrial sectors without any compensation to business owners as a plan to achieve this goal.

    During the discussion of this proposal, many representatives of Labour Party local organizations spoke. Representative Dalton emphasized in his speech that the main shortcomings of the Labour Party were not insufficient organizational work, but the lack of an independent and genuine socialist policy. Representatives from the Hampstead (London district) local organization said that the main task of the annual conference was to determine the principle of nationalizing key industrial sectors and requested the Executive Committee to formulate a concrete and detailed plan to achieve this goal before the next annual conference.

    英国工党第五十四届年会在马尔加特开幕
    新华社十一日讯　据塔斯社马尔加特讯：英国工党第五十四届年会十日在马尔加特开幕。参加这次会议的共有工党所属的六百八十五个工会、合作社和地方组织的一千二百四十六名代表。
    工党执行委员会提交年会讨论的总结报告中说，在过去三年中，工党的党员人数减少了。在一九五四年，工党共有九十三万三千六百五十七个党员，比一九五三年少八万零八百六十七人。报告还谈到工党在上届议会选举中的失败。执行委员会成立的负责调查组织工作的小组委员会在它的报告中认为，这次失败是组织工作中的缺点造成的。但是工党普通党员根据地方组织的决议和报纸的评论认为，选举失败的主要原因是工党右翼领导放弃了社会主义的原则和他们在内政和外交方面采取了同保守党政策性质相同的政策。
    提交工党年会讨论的共有四百一十八项提案和对这些提案的一百一十五个修正案。组织委员会取消了一部分同其他提案相同的提案，并且把一部分提案合并为三十八个混合提案。
    十日上午会议开始时，工党执行委员会主席萨末斯基尔按照惯例致词。接着，在听取组织委员会关于提案问题的报告以后，一些代表对他们提出的提案没有被列入议程表示抗议。木工联合会代表对有关工党今后政策的五十二个提案只有七个提案被列入议程一事表示不满。
    会议接着讨论关于工党政策的问题，年会首先讨论戈万（拉纳克郡）地方组织提出的提案。这个提案说，工党的任务应当是建设社会主义。提案主张在不对企业主作任何补偿的情况下把主要工业部门收归国有，作为达到这个目标的计划。
    在讨论这个提案时，很多工党地方组织的代表发言。代表多尔顿在发言中着重指出，工党的主要缺点不是组织工作不够，而是缺乏独立的、真正的社会主义政策。罕普斯忒区（伦敦区）地方组织的代表说，年会的主要任务是确定主要工业部门国有化的原则，并且要求执行委员会在下届年会之前拟定达到这个目标的具体而详细的计划。
