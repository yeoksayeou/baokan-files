Xinhua News Agency, Sevastopol, October 15th: According to TASS, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the heroic defense of Sevastopol in 1854-55, awarded the city the Order of the Military Red Banner, commending its great contributions to the motherland.

The award ceremony was held on October 13th at the celebration meeting of the working people's deputies of the city of Sevastopol.

Bulganin, Voroshilov, Kirichenko, Mikoyan, Khrushchev, the Minister of Defense of the USSR, Marshal of the Soviet Union Zhukov, Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union Kuznetsov, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Begov, Secretary of the Crimean Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, Polyansky, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Crimean Regional Soviet, Kuzmenko, Admiral Gorshkov, and others attended the celebration meeting.

Chairman of the Sevastopol City Soviet Executive Committee, Sosnitsky, first addressed the meeting.

Begov then read the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR awarding Sevastopol the Order of the Military Red Banner. All those present stood up, and a storm of sustained applause resounded.

When Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Voroshilov, handed the Red Banner Order to Sosnitsky and First Secretary of the Sevastopol City Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, Korovchenko, warm applause erupted in the hall again.

Afterwards, Voroshilov delivered a speech. He said, "I am very happy to award the Order of the Military Red Banner to the hero city of Sevastopol on the orders of our Communist Party Central Committee, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and the Soviet government. Sevastopol is a hero city, a city with glorious military and revolutionary traditions." Then, Voroshilov described the history of this Black Sea coastal city's several heroic defeats of the enemy, its contributions to the motherland, and the work to be done in construction in the future.

Voroshilov said that the government is very concerned about the needs of Sevastopol and is doing its best to promote its construction and continued development. However, you Sevastopol people must work better, and carry out construction more comprehensively, thoroughly, and without waste. Voroshilov then spoke in detail about some of the important steps recently taken by the Soviet government in the diplomatic field, aimed at further easing international tensions. He pointed out that among all international issues, one of the most pressing and closely related to the people of all countries in the world is the issue of disarmament. The well-known letter from Comrade Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to Mr. Eisenhower, the President of the United States, listed without omission the obstacles on the road to ending the arms race, and put forward detailed and specific suggestions that, if adopted, would make the steps to reduce armaments effective.

Voroshilov said that for the Soviet people, creative labor and peace between all peoples are the great principles and true essence of their entire tireless creative effort. It is our sacred duty to safeguard these principles as we protect the pupils of our eyes. Therefore, when there are hostile forces in the world trying every possible means to prevent us from moving forward along the path we have chosen, we must remain vigilant and always remember the past lessons that our country has paid for at the costly price of the lives, hardships, and sacred blood of the working people. First of all, our armed forces—the Army and Navy of the Soviet Union—must remember this lesson. They must be in a state of full military preparedness at all times, master the latest equipment, and constantly refine their military technology and their military and political knowledge. In other words, they must always surpass anyone who dares to attack the sacred socialist land.

First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, also spoke at the meeting. He first extended warm congratulations on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and on behalf of the Presidium of the Party Central Committee, for the city of Sevastopol receiving the Red Banner Order.

Khrushchev said that the Red Banner Order, which the city of Sevastopol received for its merits, places many obligations on it. This medal obligates it to work even better than before to strengthen the economic power of the Soviet state.

Khrushchev reviewed the great achievements made by the Soviet people in the economic and cultural fields, as well as the measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the Soviet government in the struggle for peace and easing international tensions. He also mentioned the solidarity and strength of the socialist camp, and the consolidation of fraternal relations among the peoples of the people's democratic countries.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet people are actively and enthusiastically preparing for the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Soviet men and women are greeting this great event with full creative energy. Plans for developing industry are being successfully completed. This year, farmers in many republics and regions have achieved bumper harvests. Although some areas in the east have had poor harvests due to drought, the country as a whole has harvested much more grain than in previous years. The public livestock industry is thriving, resulting in a considerable increase in the production and procurement of meat, milk, and other livestock products. There is no doubt that if we adopt a more critical attitude towards shortcomings in our work and resolutely eliminate these shortcomings, then we will surely achieve even greater progress than ever before in all economic sectors.

After the meeting, a grand performance was held.

    英雄的塞瓦斯托波尔城荣获军事红旗勋章
    伏罗希洛夫和赫鲁晓夫在授勋典礼上讲话
    新华社十五日讯　据塔斯社塞瓦斯托波尔十四日讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团在纪念一八五四—五五年塞瓦斯托波尔英雄的保卫战一百周年的时候，奖给这个城市以军事红旗勋章，表扬它对祖国的伟大功绩。
    十月十三日在塞瓦斯托波尔市劳动人民代表苏维埃庆祝会上举行了授勋典礼。
    布尔加宁，伏罗希洛夫，基里钦科，米高扬，赫鲁晓夫，苏联国防部长、苏联元帅朱可夫，苏联海军元帅库兹涅佐夫，苏联最高苏维埃主席团秘书别哥夫，乌克兰共产党克里米亚州委员会书记波利扬斯基，克里米亚州苏维埃执行委员会主席库兹缅科，海军上将戈尔什科夫等都出席了庆祝会。
    塞瓦斯托波尔市苏维埃执行委员会主席索斯尼茨基首先在会上致词。
    别哥夫接着宣读了苏联最高苏维埃主席团授予塞瓦斯托波尔以军事红旗勋章的命令。全体到会的人起立，响起了暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。
    当苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫把红旗勋章交给索斯尼茨基和乌克兰共产党塞瓦斯托波尔市委员会第一书记科罗夫钦科时，大厅里又响起了热烈的掌声。
    接着，伏罗希洛夫发表了演说。他说，我非常高兴地根据我们的共产党中央委员会、苏联最高苏维埃主席团和苏维埃政府的命令，把军事红旗勋章奖给英雄的塞瓦斯托波尔城。塞瓦斯托波尔是一个英雄城、一个具有光荣的军事和革命传统的城市。接着，伏罗希洛夫叙述了这座黑海海滨的城市几次英勇挫败敌人的历史、对祖国的功绩和今后在建设方面所要做的工作。
    伏罗希洛夫说，政府非常关心塞瓦斯托波尔的需要，而且尽力来促进它的建设和继续发展。但是，你们塞瓦斯托波尔人必须更好地工作，更全面、彻底、毫无浪费地进行建设。伏罗希洛夫接着详细地谈到了苏联政府最近在外交方面采取的一些目的在于进一步缓和国际紧张局势的重要步骤。他指出，在所有国际问题中，最迫切和对世界上一切国家的人民关系最密切的问题之一是裁军问题。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁同志写给美国总统艾森豪威尔先生的那封众所周知的信，毫无遗漏地列举了在结束军备竞赛道路上的障碍，并详尽地提出了具体的建议，这些建议如果被采用的话，将使裁减军备的步骤成为有效。
    伏罗希洛夫说，对于苏联人民来说，创造性劳动和各国人民之间的和平，是他们整个不倦的创造性努力的伟大原则和真正实质。像保护眼珠一样地维护这些原则，是我们的神圣职责。因此，当世界上存在着千方百计设法阻挡我们按照我们选定的道路前进的敌对力量的时候，我们一定要保持警惕，时时刻刻记住我们的国家以劳动人民的生命、艰难和神圣的鲜血的昂贵代价换取的以往的教训。首先，我们的武装部队——苏联的陆军和海军——必须记住这个教训。他们必须时时刻刻处于充分作好军事准备的状态，要掌握最新的装备和不断地精通他们的军事技术和他们的军事和政治知识。换句话说，他们必须总是超过那些敢于进攻神圣的社会主义国土的任何人。
    苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫也在会上讲了话。他首先代表苏联共产党中央委员会、代表党中央委员会主席团对于塞瓦斯托波尔城得到红旗勋章致以热烈的祝贺。
    赫鲁晓夫说，塞瓦斯托波尔城因功绩而获得的红旗勋章使它承担了许多义务。这个勋章使它有义务比以前更好地工作，以加强苏维埃国家的经济力量。
    赫鲁晓夫回顾了苏联人民在经济和文化方面所取得的伟大成就以及党中央委员会和苏联政府在争取和平和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中所采取的措施，他还提到了社会主义阵营的团结和力量的强大增长以及人民民主国家的人民之间的兄弟关系的巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人民正在积极热情地为苏联共产党第二十次代表大会进行筹备工作。苏联男女正在以饱满的创造性力量来迎接这个伟大的事件。发展工业的计划正在成功地完成中。今年，许多共和国和地区的农民获得了丰收。尽管东部某些地区由于旱灾而歉收，整个说来，国家还是比过去几年多收了很多的粮食。公有的畜牧业正在蒸蒸日上，结果在肉类、牛奶和其他牲畜产品的生产和收购方面有了相当大的增加。毫无疑问，如果我们对于工作中的缺点采取更多的批评的态度而且坚决消灭这些缺点，那末我们就一定会在一切经济部门中取得比以往更大的进展。
    会后举行了盛大的表演会。
