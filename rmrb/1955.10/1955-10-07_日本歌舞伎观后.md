    After Seeing Japanese Kabuki
    Ouyang Yuqian, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association

    The Japanese Kabuki troupe came to visit China for performances. I had made some introductions based on my limited knowledge. Now I would like to talk about my impressions after seeing the performances.

    I especially like "Kanjincho" (The Subscription List). Generally speaking, this play is healthy, simple, and full of spirit. Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke plays Benkei, the retainer of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, and is very capable of portraying a calm, brave, and resourceful samurai. His dialogue is exceptionally fluent and full of emotion. Also, the dialogue is closely combined with the music. His movements are very dance-like, and each movement is accurate and rhythmically clear, which is commendable.

    In "Kanjincho," the singing, dancing, and plot development are closely integrated. Just watching Benkei drink and pretend to be drunk, dancing a section of Ennen-mai, the audience feels that he is distracting the gatekeeper's attention to achieve the purpose of passing through the gate. This dance does not contradict the overarching action of the play, so it does not appear stiff.

    Togashi is moved by Benkei's loyalty, courage, and talent, and lets them pass, which is in line with the wishes of the Japanese people at the time. The feudal ruling class killed each other for power, causing innocent disasters to the common people. They hoped to stop this senseless private fighting and unify the country so that the common people could also catch their breath. This play reflects this wish and is therefore welcomed. Also, Kabuki, which developed and grew with the support and cultivation of the emerging bourgeoisie, often used good samurai to praise the heroes of the "townspeople class" and used bad samurai to satirize the feudal rulers. Figures like Benkei and Togashi were used to symbolize the righteous actions of the time. This is another reason why "Kanjincho" is welcomed. Furthermore, initially only female roles had dances in Kabuki, and later male dances were introduced. Benkei's dance in "Kanjincho" expresses the spirit of a brave warrior and presents Japanese masculine beauty, which is also worth praising. Mr. Ennosuke's performance of the Ennen-mai is quite moving.

    Kabuki, like Chinese opera, has single acts and complete plays. Sometimes a section is extracted from a complete play, slightly modified and supplemented, to become a complete single act; or a single act can be expanded into a complete play. Therefore, some people say that Kabuki scripts are mostly freely expandable and contractible. "The Stammering Yuranosuke" is a section from "Keisei Hangonkō" (Courtesan's Incense Returns to Life). Originally it was divided into three parts, the story was very long, and the plot was convoluted, but "The Stammering Yuranosuke" as a one-act play still has a complete structure. This play is abbreviated as "Kitsu-Yura," and there are different views on this play in Japan: some people think that the tiger in the painting came alive and ran out, and the painting permeated the stone, which is anti-scientific; others say that this is not a question of whether it is anti-scientific or not, but merely a poet's exaggeration, extremely speaking of the great power of a person's sincerity, so the actor playing Yuranosuke does not just have to learn how to stammer to play the role well, but must express his sincere devotion. Therefore, they think this play is a very good play. After watching this play, I thought: could it be treated as a satirical play? Yuranosuke is a founder of a school of painting, so he must have talent; when he hears that the painter Kano is in trouble, he immediately draws his sword to rescue him, showing that he is brave and promising; just because he stutters, his teacher denies everything about him, and everyone looks down on him. He is so angry that he wants to commit suicide. Before his death, he paints his portrait on a stone in the courtyard, and the ink penetrates the back of the stone. His teacher is amazed at the miracle and immediately allows him to inherit his name, and gives him clothes and two swords, which means that Yuranosuke has social status. This is quite comical. If Yuranosuke's portrait had not penetrated the back of the stone, his teacher would never have discovered his genius, and this teacher can be imagined. Originally, the old painter Tosa Shogen hid an ancient painting of pine trees and never showed it to anyone. Later, because the Bodhisattva indicated in a dream, he took it out to show to a famous painter, Kano, who copied the pine tree and became famous for it, and was therefore framed by another painter. I think the original work by Chikamatsu Monzaemon contains a profound meaning of exposure and satire. The role of Yuranosuke is indeed not easy to play. In feudal society, it is very painful for a person to be unappreciated. Stammering is not a defect for a painter, but it is discriminated against because of this, not only burying his artistic talent, but almost depriving him of his right to survive. Yuranosuke's indignation is understandable. When Yuranosuke wants to say many things in his heart but his mouth does not obey, we only feel sympathy and sadness for him. Mr. Ennosuke's acting is successful in this regard. I especially like the section where he hears that Kano is in trouble, which arouses his full of righteous indignation, and he clutches his sword and kneels in front of the stage without saying a word, waiting for his teacher's order. His inner excitement can be completely seen from his concise movements.

    "Dojoji Temple" is a very beautiful and poetic legend, which can be made into a very good ballet. Kabuki has made great contributions in preserving many of Japan's most outstanding folk dances in this program; at the same time, it has repeatedly processed these dances to make them perfect, becoming a colorful, extremely beautiful, and complete national classical dance art, which is very valuable. When we watch it, it is as if we have entered a garden full of flowers, and we can't take it all in. But as a ballet, I feel that the theme of the play is not clear enough, and many beautiful dances do not seem to be organically linked. I wonder if it is possible to re-choreograph it based on the original legend, so that its content is completely free from the shackles of feudal morality, and that these excellent and beautiful folk dances can exert more of their power, so that it can better gain the understanding of modern audiences and arouse a more intimate resonance. This is my personal amateur opinion, and I should consult Mr. Ennosuke and the members of the Kabuki troupe.

    The three plays performed by Japanese Kabuki this time are all representative works, and we can see the outline of this dramatic art from this; but these three plays alone are not enough to encompass the whole picture of Kabuki. This rich, colorful, deeply accumulated, and highly accomplished Japanese classical dramatic art contains a lot of things. What I have talked about and seen is just a drop in the bucket, and I hope to learn more.

### 日本歌舞伎观后

    日本歌舞伎观后
    中国戏剧家协会副主席欧阳予倩
    日本歌舞伎到新中国作访问演出，我曾根据一点浅薄的知识作过一些介绍，现在我想谈一谈观后感：
    我特别喜欢“劝进帐”（化缘簿）。这个戏总的说起来，健康朴素精神饱满。市川猿之助氏饰源义经的家将弁庆，很能够表现出一个沉着勇敢而富于机智的武士。他的道白异常流利，感情充沛。还有就是道白跟音乐结合得很紧。他的动作舞蹈性很强，每个动作都很准确，节奏鲜明，这是难能可贵的。
    在“劝进帐”这个戏里，歌、舞和剧情的发展是紧密结合着的，只看弁庆饮酒假装醉态跳一段延年舞，观众感觉他是在分散守关兵士的注意力而达到过关的目的，这段舞跟这个戏的贯串动作并不矛盾，因此就不显得生硬。
    富樫为弁庆的忠勇和才干所感动，就放他们过关，这是符合于当时日本人民的愿望的。封建统治阶级因争权而相杀，使百姓遭受无妄之灾，他们是希望停止这种无谓的私斗，把国家统一起来让老百姓也好喘喘气，这个戏反映了这种愿望，也就受到欢迎。还有就是在新兴资产阶级支持培养之下发展壮大的歌舞伎，往往借好的武士来歌颂“町人阶级”的英雄，用坏的武士讽刺封建统治者，弁庆和富樫这样的人物是用以象征当时的正义行动的，这是
  “劝进帐”受到欢迎的又一理由。还有：最初歌舞伎只有旦角有舞蹈，以后才有男性的舞蹈，“劝进帐”弁庆的舞蹈表现着勇士的精神呈现出日本的男性美，这也是值得称道的。猿之助氏表演的延年舞颇为动人。
    歌舞伎也跟中国戏一样，有单出，有整本，有的时候从整本里抽出一段来略加修改补充，便成一个完整的单出；也可以把单出加以扩充成一个整本；所以有人说歌舞伎的剧本多半是可以伸缩自由的。“口吃的又平”就是“倾城返魂香”中间的一段，原来是分三部分，故事很长，情节很曲折，可是“口吃的又平”这一片断作为一个独幕戏看，结构也还是完整的。这个戏简称“吃又”，在日本对这个戏也有不同的看法：有人以为画上的老虎活了跑出去，画像透过石头，这是反科学的；有人说这不是什么反科学不反科学的问题，这不过是诗人的夸张手法，极言一个人的精诚有巨大的力量，所以演又平的并不是只要学会了口吃就可以演好，必须要把他的精诚一念表达出来。因此认为这个戏是很好的戏。我看了这个戏曾经这样想：是不是可以把它当作讽刺戏来处理呢？又平是一个开派的画家，不用说他是有天才的；他一听见画师狩野遭难马上拔出刀来要去援救，可见他是勇敢有为的；就只因为他是个结巴，他的老师就把他的一切都否定了，大家也看不起他，他气得要自杀，在临死以前把自己的像画在庭前的一块石头上，墨痕透过石头的背面，他的老师一看惊为神奇，马上让他承继了自己的名字，送给他衣服和两把剑，这就表示又平有了社会地位了。这是相当滑稽的，如果又平的画像透不过石背，他的老师永远发现不了他的天才，这位老师也就可想而知了。原来土佐将监这位老画家，他藏了一轴画了松树的古画，从来不给人看，后来因为菩萨从梦中指示，他才拿出来给一个名画家狩野看了，狩野把这幅松树临摹出来，以是得名，因此被另一画师陷害，我觉得近松的原作包含着暴露和讽刺是意味深长的。又平这个角色的确不大好演。在封建社会里一个人怀才不遇是很苦的，口吃在一个画家不能算什么缺点，可是竟因此而遭受歧视，不仅埋没了他的艺术天才，几乎剥夺了他的生存权利，又平的愤慨是可以理解的。当又平想把他心里的许多话说出来而他的嘴不听使唤，我们只觉得同情，替他难过，这一点猿之助氏的演技是成功的，我特别欢喜他听见狩野遭难，引起他满腔的义愤，握紧了他的刀向台前一跪一言不发等候他老师的命令的那一段表演。他的内心的激动完全可以从他简炼的几个动作看出来。
      “双蝶道成寺”是一个很美丽很有诗意的传说，可以把它做成一个很好的舞剧。歌舞伎在这个节目里把许多日本最优秀的民间舞蹈保存下来，有很大的功绩；同时把这些舞蹈一再加工，使他们尽善尽美，成为华彩缤纷极其美丽而完整的民族的古典舞蹈艺术，这是非常可贵的。我们看了好像进入万花丛中，目不暇给。但是作为一个舞剧来看，我感觉到戏的主题思想不够明确，许多美丽的舞蹈似乎还没有能够有机的联系起来。不知道是否有可能根据原来的传说重新编制一下，使它的内容完全脱除封建道德的束缚，使这些优秀的、美丽的民间舞蹈更多的发挥它的力量，这样或者更能获得现代观众的理解，引起更亲切的共鸣。这是我个人外行的意见，应当向猿之助先生和歌舞伎剧团的各位先生请教的。
    这一次日本歌舞伎所演的三个戏，都是代表作，我们可以就此看到这一戏剧艺术的轮廓；但是单就这三个戏并不足以概括歌舞伎的全貌，这一个丰富的多色多采的、有深厚积累、有高度成就的日本古典戏剧艺术，所包含的东西是很多的，我所谈到见到的不过是长河一勺，还希望能够更多的学习。
