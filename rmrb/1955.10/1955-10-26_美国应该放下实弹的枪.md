The United States Should Put Down Its Live Ammunition Gun
Jiang Yuanchun
On the 22nd, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride announced that the U.S. military command in Taiwan would be renamed the "U.S. Taiwan Defense Command" from November 1st, from the so-called "Taiwan Liaison Center." As the Associated Press reporter pointed out, this shows that "the United States has established an organization that will be immediately ready to take on the task of a combat command headquarters in the event of hostilities in the Taiwan area."

The measure announced by Pride is one of many steps recently taken by the United States to step up the use of force to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. On the one hand, the United States is delaying the Sino-American talks in Geneva, promoting that China should guarantee not to use force to exercise sovereignty over its own territory of Taiwan. On the other hand, it is actively strengthening its military forces in the Taiwan area. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Taiwan has increased from one squadron to one wing. An aircraft carrier detachment of the U.S. Pacific Fleet has been transferred to the command of the Seventh Fleet. Airports in Taiwan are being expanded and have large reserves of fuel and ammunition. According to the "Washington Post," there are currently 10,000 military personnel in Taiwan, of which 1,500 belong to the U.S. military delegation, and the rest are air force personnel.

The United States is also actively strengthening the military forces of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. In addition to continuing to provide the Chiang Kai-shek clique with warships, aircraft, and expanded military and economic assistance, the United States is also strengthening the Chiang gang's arms industry. With the aid and support of the United States, the Chiang gang's harassment and attacks on the mainland coast have also become more frequent than before. It even scattered a large number of aquatic explosives in coastal fishing grounds, killing fishermen engaged in peaceful labor.

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles likes to talk about "military force should not be used offensively to achieve national purposes." May I ask, isn't the United States' occupation of China's territory Taiwan with armed forces and the establishment of a command headquarters and the strengthening of various military forces there "using military force offensively to achieve national purposes?" Dulles also likes to talk about not wanting people to point guns at the head of the United States. May I ask, is it the United States that has seized China's territory and pointed a live ammunition gun at China, or is it China that has occupied the territory of the United States and done so?

The answer made by the facts themselves is very clear. The United States should use the facts to answer the questions it raises. It should withdraw the armed forces it uses in the Taiwan area; it should put down its live ammunition gun.

    美国应该放下实弹的枪
    蒋元椿
    美国第七舰队司令普赖德在二十二日宣布，美国在台湾的军事指挥机构，将从十一月一日起由所谓“台湾联络中心”改称为“美军协防台湾司令部”。正如美联社的记者所指出的，这表明“美国已经建立了一个一旦在台湾地区发生敌对行动时就将立即准备好担负起作战指挥总部任务的组织”。
    普赖德宣布的这一措施，是美国最近加紧使用武力来阻挠中国人民解放台湾的许多步骤之一。美国一方面在日内瓦拖延中美会谈，宣传要中国保证不使用武力来对中国自己的领土台湾行使主权，另一方面，它却在台湾地区积极加强军事力量。驻在台湾的美国空军由一个中队增加到了一个联队。美国太平洋舰队的一个航空母舰分队已经调归第七舰队指挥。台湾的机场正在扩大，并且储有大量的燃料和弹药。据“华盛顿邮报”透露：目前在台湾的军事人员已经达到一万人，其中一千五百名属于美国军事代表团，其余的是空军人员。
    美国也在积极加强蒋介石卖国集团的军事力量。美国除了继续给予蒋介石集团军舰、飞机和扩大军事、经济方面的援助以外，还在加强蒋贼的军火工业。在美国的援助和支持之下，蒋贼集团对大陆沿海的骚扰袭击也比从前更加频繁。它甚至在沿海渔场撒放大批水上爆炸物，杀害从事和平劳动的渔民。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯喜欢讲什么“不应当进攻性地使用军事力量来达到国家的目的”。试问，美国用武装力量侵占中国领土台湾并且在那里建立司令部和加强各种军事力量，这不是“进攻性地使用军事力量来达到国家目的”是什么？杜勒斯又喜欢讲什么不愿意让人家拿手枪对着美国的头。试问，究竟是美国强占了中国的领土并且拿实弹手枪对着中国，还是中国占着美国的领土，这样做了呢？
    事实本身所做的答案非常清楚。美国出的题目都应该它自己用事实来解答。它应该撤走它在台湾地区使用的武装力量；它应该放下它的实弹的手枪。
