    New Discovery of Prime Coking Coal in Henan Province
    A prospecting team from the Ministry of Geology recently discovered a type of prime coking coal urgently needed by the iron and steel industry in Henan Province, a hundred li away from Pingdingshan. The ash and impurity content of this prime coking coal is below the prescribed standards, with good quality and large quantity, including a layer that is more than thirty feet thick.
    Prime coking coal can be used alone for coking without the need for other blending coal. The coking coal previously explored in the nearby areas was all blending coal, which needs to be used with other corresponding blending coal to form coke. The discovery of prime coking coal greatly improves the mining value of the coalfield in the nearby area.

    河南省新发现主焦煤
    地质部的一个勘探队最近在河南省距平顶山百里外的地方，发现了一种为钢铁工业所急需的主焦煤。这里的主焦煤所含灰分和杂质都低于规定标准，质好量多，其中有一层厚达三丈多。
    主焦煤不需要其它配焦煤配合就能单独炼焦。附近地区过去探明的焦煤，都是配焦煤，需要同其它相应的配焦煤配合才能炼成焦炭。主焦煤的发现，大大提高了附近地区煤田的开采价值。
