The Huoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sihezhuang, Ding County, Hebei Province, is a large cooperative with 177 households, expanded last year, and one of the best key cooperatives in the county. However, due to the sabotage by reactionary rich peasant Yu Lojiu, who infiltrated the Party and the cooperative, the relationships between cadres, between members, and between poor and middle peasants deteriorated day by day. Poor peasants became poorer after joining the cooperative, and the Party's prestige among the people was also weakening.

How Yu Lojiu Infiltrated the Party

When the working farmers of Sihezhuang village mention the vicious methods used by Yu Lojiu in his sabotage, they are filled with endless resentment. As old farmer Yu Luoxin said, "Who in the surrounding villages doesn't know the smiling wolf Yu Lojiu!"

As early as the "July 7th" Incident, Yu Lojiu operated more than 240 mu of land and employed both long-term and short-term laborers. When the Communist Party came, he pretended to "welcome the Communist Party" on the one hand, but secretly engaged in counter-revolutionary activities on the other. In 1938, Communist Party members in the village, in order to implement the government's policy of reasonable burden and support the War of Resistance Against Japan, organized a farmers' association consisting of poor peasants, farm laborers, and some middle peasants led by Yu Luofen; Yu Lojiu colluded with reactionary landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries to organize a fake farmers' association to resist and sabotage the policy of reasonable burden. After the Party organization led the masses in struggle and dissolved his reactionary organization, Yu Lojiu realized that head-on confrontation wouldn't work, so he switched to a despicable and shameless two-faced approach, pretending to be "progressive" and "enlightened," and took the initiative to give away seven sacks of red sorghum as "relief to the poor," deceiving and misleading some backward masses and Party cadres with blurred class viewpoints. He saw that Yu Luochang, a Party branch committee member from a poor peasant background, had a blurred class viewpoint and liked to be flattered, so he often visited Yu Luochang's home, bringing rice when Yu Luochang's family was short of it, and carrying firewood when they had none. Sometimes, when he went to the city or the market, he would bring back things for Yu Luochang without asking for money. As time went on, Yu Luochang fell into the trap of reactionary rich peasant Yu Lojiu. With Yu Luochang's introduction, Yu Lojiu finally infiltrated the Party in 1940 and successively seized important positions such as village chief and deputy secretary of the Party branch.

Playing Two-Faced Tricks

Hidden enemies are accustomed to using two-faced tactics. In the spring of 1952, when the Party called on Party members to lead the broad masses of farmers to take the road of "getting organized" by setting an example, Yu Lojiu "took the lead" in organizing a mutual aid group with five rich peasant households. After spring plowing and sowing, he heard the news of evaluating model mutual aid groups, so he deliberately took out 30 yuan and distributed it to other households in the group as land investment; then he boasted everywhere about his "mutual aid and friendship" spirit in order to deceive the masses and leaders. Sure enough, in the evaluation that year, the mutual aid group led by Yu Lojiu was rated as a "model group," and he himself was rated as a "model cadre." In the winter of the same year, he saw that Party branch secretary Yu Logui, branch committee member Yu Loce, and Party member Lei Ping were preparing to establish a cooperative, he expressed his active support to their faces, but secretly instructed landlords and rich peasant elements to spread rumors and sabotage, saying things like "joining the cooperative means eating from a big pot" and so on. At that time, most of the poor and middle peasants in the village expressed their firm determination to join the cooperative, especially the Party cadres were very confident in running the cooperative. Seeing that his conspiracy was about to fail, Yu Lojiu took the approach of "taking advantage of the situation" and quickly organized an agricultural cooperative with 14 rich peasant households and one poor peasant household. From then on, he pretended even more cleverly and showed even more "enthusiasm" for his work. In 1953, when the government called for growing more cotton and promoting cotton thinning and pruning techniques, Yu Lojiu, in order to show "achievements" and further deceive the trust of the district leaders, "took the lead" in responding to everything, and even planted more than 40 mu of high-yield cotton on both sides of the road with heavy traffic to and from the county and district, and specially processed and fertilized this piece of land. As a result, in the summer of that year, the district leaders organized the heads of agricultural cooperatives, labor models, and production experts from the entire district to visit the "high-yield cotton" of this rich peasant cooperative. From then on, in the eyes of the county and district leaders, Yu Lojiu became a "good cadre" who was "active," "progressive," and "capable." In the autumn, Yu Lojiu used the despicable trick of falsely reporting cotton yields to obtain the glorious title of "labor model" and further seized the important position of deputy secretary of the Party branch. From then on, Yu Lojiu's "model deeds" spread in many villages in Ding County.

Usurping the Leadership of the Agricultural Production Cooperative

In the winter of 1953, the four small cooperatives led by Party members Yu Logui, Yu Loce, and others in Sihezhuang began to prepare to merge into two medium-sized cooperatives. At this time, Yu Lojiu believed that the time had come to collude with landlords and rich peasants to usurp leadership, so on the one hand, he actively absorbed landlords and rich peasants into the cooperative on the basis of his original small cooperative, and on the other hand, he actively worked to merge the entire village into one large cooperative. In order to usurp the leadership of the large cooperative, he spread the argument among the masses that "illiterates cannot lead a large cooperative," and bragged to the district leaders that he had experience in running cooperatives, saying that Communist Party members Yu Logui, Yu Loce, and others from poor peasant backgrounds were "ideologically backward," "illiterate, and incompetent," viciously attacking the prestige of Party members Yu Daoxian, Yu Logui, and others who were loyal to the Party. Zhou Qingfang, the district committee secretary who had a blurred class viewpoint and a bureaucratic work style, not only did not approve Yu Logui and others to establish a medium-sized cooperative, but also mistakenly instructed the village to "only allow the establishment of a large cooperative and not allow the merger of medium-sized cooperatives." In order to implement the Party's policy of mutual aid and cooperation and class policy, Yu Logui, Yu Loce, and others found Du Zhicai, the deputy secretary of the county party committee, and Zhou Qingfang, the secretary of the district party committee, who were helping to build the cooperative in the village at the time, but Du and Zhou had already been blinded by the reactionary rich peasant Yu Lojiu's flattery, "warm hospitality," and "active" work and other despicable two-faced tactics, and said without any class stand: "The class policy can be implemented in other villages, but it must be said differently in your village." In this way, the large cooperative was established under the exclusive control of individual county and district leaders.

When it came to electing the director of the cooperative, most Party members unanimously opposed Yu Lojiu becoming the director. Yu Lojiu secretly mobilized all landlords and rich peasant members to actively participate in the vote to elect himself. As a result of the election, Yu Lojiu's votes were still less than those of branch secretary Yu Logui and branch committee member Yu Loce. In the end, the cooperative construction work team violated the articles of association and the democratic rights of the members and forced Yu Lojiu to become the director in the name of "approval from the county party committee."

After Yu Lojiu, a reactionary rich peasant who has always been hostile to the people, usurped the position of director, in order to systematically and plan to completely destroy the cooperative, he arranged landlords and rich peasant elements from the cooperative committee members to the heads and deputy heads of sections, accountants, and heads and deputy heads of production teams, and even the work recorders of each team. Seven of the eleven accountants in the cooperative were landlords and rich peasants. Yu Lojiu also decided without authorization that he and reactionary landlords Yu Qixiang and Yu Runxiang would be cadres who were detached from production. This meant that the power of the cooperative was completely controlled by the landlords and rich peasants. From then on, the poor and middle peasant members, who accounted for more than two-thirds of the total households in the cooperative, were again in a position of being economically exploited and politically oppressed. Therefore, the poor and middle peasant members in the cooperative criticized our leaders with blurred class viewpoints and said: "The Party's class policy in the countryside is correct, but the county and district cadres working in our village have changed it."

Vicious Sabotage

After the reactionary landlord and rich peasant group headed by Yu Lojiu grasped the leadership of the large cooperative, they felt that the position had been consolidated, and from then on, they launched various sabotage activities.

They used their power to treat poor peasants harshly and reduce their income whenever they had the opportunity. When the large cooperative was merged in 1953, no distribution regulations were made for the autumn wheat planted by the small cooperatives and individual farmers before the merger. When the wheat was harvested, under the manipulation of reactionary landlords and rich peasant elements, it was forcibly stipulated that dividends would be distributed according to the ratio of 80% for land and 20% for labor. Yu Lojiu withheld the 20% of wheat that the members received in the name of "selling patriotic grain," attempting to starve the poor members. This caused some members to be dissatisfied with the state's policy of unified grain purchase. They also used the method of not assigning work or assigning less work to poor peasant members to reduce their income. Poor peasant Wang Jixian was in the fourth production team (mostly landlords and rich peasants), and not only was she not assigned work, but her sixteen-year-old daughter was only given two points of work for breaking clods of earth in the cooperative for a whole day. Poor peasant member Liang Suguo only picked cotton for ten days last year and dug half a mu of Chinese yams. As a result, the lives of many poor peasants and widowed households became increasingly impoverished.

This spring, the government issued 3,360 yuan of cotton pre-sale money to the Huoguang Cooperative to help poor farmers solve their production difficulties, but Yu Lojiu refused to distribute it to the poor members. Later, after the persistent struggle of Communist Party members, a small portion was distributed, but thirteen rich peasant households who should not have enjoyed it also received cotton pre-sale money.

The credit department of the Huoguang Cooperative, because it was controlled by landlords and rich peasants, also became a weapon for landlords and rich peasants to exploit and attack poor peasants. Last winter and this spring, the total amount of loans from state banks and deposits from the masses reached more than 8,300 yuan, of which only more than 300 yuan was loaned to poor peasant members out of the 1,800 yuan loaned to members. Four reactionary rich peasants, headed by Yu Lojiu, who should not have been loaned money, were also loaned money. However, poor peasant member Li Wencai, who had no food at home, went to Yu Lojiu several times, but not only did he not give him a loan, but he also took the opportunity to distort policies and undermine the relationship between the Party and the government and the people, saying: "The bank is afraid that you will not be able to repay, and instructed us not to allow loans to you poor peasants." Li Wencai could not get a loan and was forced to sell his gate. He said: "I just started to live a good life after liberation, but after joining the cooperative, I was bullied by the rich peasants again."

They also took all kinds of despicable and shameless means to sow discord, undermine unity, and attack advanced members and advanced teams. The original fifth team was the best team in terms of unity and production, and had been rated as a model team for the entire cooperative twice. Because of its good production, it played a decisive role in consolidating and improving the cooperative. Therefore, this team became a thorn in the side of the Yu Lojiu reactionary group, and they tried to attack and sabotage it, but they never found an opportunity. Last autumn, when this team was divided into the ninth and tenth teams, according to regulations, a new iron-wheeled cart should have been allocated to the ninth team for use, but the tenth team also wanted it, so the two teams had different opinions. Yu Lojiu felt that this was a good opportunity to sow discord, so he said to the members of the tenth team: "The ninth team is selfish and has too much localism. There is only one new iron-wheeled cart, why should they always get to use it? Don't let them use it! See what they can do!" He turned around and said to the members of the ninth team: "The cart should follow the livestock, and the livestock has been allocated to the ninth team, so the new cart should also belong to you. You should solve it yourselves!" Under his instigation, the contradictions between the two teams became more and more acute, and production was also affected as a result.

The Enemy Failed

Although the two-faced tactics of the reactionary rich peasant Yu Lojiu were very clever, he could not escape the eyes of the people in the end. One day in May this year, Yu Daoxian, the secretary of the township general branch, and others gathered the opinions of the masses and wrote a letter of accusation to the provincial public security organs, accusing Yu Lojiu of his crimes. Like the poor peasants in the land reform who poured out their grievances, the broad masses of the village angrily accused and exposed Yu Lojiu's criminal facts to the staff sent by the public security organs. After more than a month of investigation, it was fully proved that Yu Lojiu was a class enemy who had infiltrated the Party and had been engaged in criminal activities against the Party and the people. The Ding County Party Committee has expelled him from the Party, and the People's Government has also arrested him according to law and given him the punishment he deserved.

    反动富农于洛九是怎样破坏农业生产合作社的
    毛凤恩　赵炳昕
    河北省定县四合庄火光农业生产合作社是去年扩建起来拥有一百七十七户的大社，是全县最好的重点社之一。但因受到钻进党内和社内来的反动富农分子于洛九的破坏，社内干部之间、社员之间、贫、中农之间的关系日益恶化，贫苦农民入社后越来越贫困，党在人民群众中的威信也在日渐削弱。
    于洛九怎样钻进党内
    四合庄村的劳动农民提起于洛九进行阴谋破坏所采取的毒辣手段的时候，都有说不尽的愤恨。正如老农于洛信说的：“十村八乡的人谁不知道笑面狼于洛九啊！”
    早在“七七”事变的时候，于洛九经营着二百四十多亩土地，雇有长工和短工。共产党来了，他一面伪装“欢迎共产党”，一面却暗地干着反革命的勾当。一九三八年，这村共产党员为了贯彻执行政府的合理负担政策，支持抗日战争，于洛芬等组织了贫、雇农并有中农参加的农会；于洛九就纠合反动地主、富农以及反革命分子十六人组织一个假农会进行对抗，破坏合理负担政策。后经党组织领导群众进行斗争，解散其反动组织，于洛九觉得硬碰不行，就转而采取了卑鄙无耻的两面手法，伪装“进步”和“开明”，先后自动拿出七口袋红高粱“赈济贫民”，欺骗和蒙蔽了部分落后群众和阶级观点模糊的党员干部。他看出贫农出身的党支部委员于洛昌阶级观点模糊，喜欢人家奉承，他就常去于洛昌家串门，于洛昌家缺米了他就背点米来，没柴烧了他就扛点柴来；有时进城和赶集给于洛昌捎回东西也不要钱。日子一长，于洛昌就坠入了反动富农于洛九的圈套，经于洛昌介绍，于洛九终于在一九四零年钻进了党内，并且先后窃取了村长、党支部副书记等重要职务。
    玩弄两面派的手法
    暗藏的敌人是惯于使用两面派手法的。一九五二年春，党号召党员要以身作则带动广大农民走“组织起来”的道路，于洛九却“带头”组织起一个有五户富农参加的互助组。在春耕播种后，他听到了评比模范互助组的消息，就故意拿出三十元钱分给组内其他户作为土地投资；然后就到处吹嘘自己的“互助友爱”精神，以此来蒙蔽群众，欺骗领导。果然就在这年评比中，于洛九领导的互助组被评为“模范组”，他本人也被评为“模范干部”。在同年冬天，他看到党支部书记于洛贵、支委于洛策、党员雷平等酝酿建社，他当面表示积极拥护，背地里却指使地主、富农分子进行造谣破坏。说什么“入社吃大锅饭”等等。当时全村多数贫农、中农表示坚决入社，尤其是党员干部办社信心都很足，于洛九眼看自己的阴谋即将破产，便采取了“趁机赶上去”的办法，很快组织起一个有十四户富农一户贫农的农业合作社。从此，他伪装得更巧妙，对工作表示更“积极”了。一九五三年政府号召多种棉花和推广棉花间苗整枝等技术，于洛九为了显示“成绩”和进一步骗取区领导上的信任，事事“带头”响应，还特意在县、区来往人多的大道两旁，种了四十多亩丰产棉花，专在这块地里加工加肥。结果，就在这年夏天，区领导上组织了全区农业合作社社长、劳动模范、生产能手参观了这个富农社的“丰产棉花”。从此，于洛九在县、区领导上的眼睛里成了“积极”、“进步”、“有能力”的“好干部”。秋天，于洛九以假报棉花产量的卑鄙伎俩骗取了“劳动模范”的光荣称号，进而窃取了党支部副书记的重要职务。从此，于洛九的“模范事迹”就在定县的许多村庄传开了。
    篡夺农业合作社的领导权
    一九五三年冬天，四合庄的党员于洛贵、于洛策等领导的四个小社开始酝酿合并两个中社。这时，于洛九认为纠集地主、富农篡夺领导权的时机已到，于是一面在他原来小社的基础上积极吸收地主、富农入社，一面积极活动全村合并一个大社。为了篡夺大社领导权，他在群众中散布“大老粗领导不了大社”的论调，并且在区领导面前卖弄自己办社有经验，说于洛贵、于洛策等贫农出身的共产党员“思想落后”、“大老粗，没能力”，恶毒地打击忠实于党的党员于导先、于洛贵等人的威信。阶级观点模糊、有官僚主义作风的区委书记周清芳，不仅不批准于洛贵等成立中社，并错误地指示这个村“只许成立大社，不准合并中社。”为了执行党的互助合作政策和阶级政策，于洛贵、于洛策等人曾找到当时在这村帮助建社的县委副书记杜志才和区委书记周清芳，但是杜、周已被反动富农于洛九的阿谀奉承“热情招待”和工作“积极”等卑鄙的两面手法所蒙蔽，竟毫无阶级立场地说：“阶级政策在别的村可以贯彻执行，在你们村就得另说。”大社就这样在个别县区领导人员的一手包办下成立起来了。
    酝酿选举社长的时候，多数党员都一致反对于洛九当社长。于洛九就暗中动员所有地主、富农社员积极参加投票选自己。选举结果，于洛九的选票仍少于支部书记于洛贵、支委于洛策。最后建社工作组违反社章和社员的民主权利，竟以“县委批准”的名义硬让于洛九当了社长。
    一贯同人民为敌的反动富农于洛九篡夺了社长的职权以后，为了有组织、有计划地把社彻底搞垮，从社务委员到正副股长、会计、正副生产队长、直到各队的记工员等，都安排上了地主、富农分子。全社十一个会计有七个是地主、富农。于洛九还擅自决定他和反动地主于启祥、于润祥三人为脱离生产的干部。这就使社里的大权完全控制在地主、富农手里了。从此，占全社总农户三分之二以上的贫农、中农社员又处于在经济上受剥削、政治上受压迫的地位。因此，社里的贫农、中农社员批评我们那些阶级观点模糊的领导人员说：“党在农村的阶级政策是正确的，在俺村工作的县、区干部却把它变了样。”
    恶毒的破坏
    以于洛九为首的反动地主、富农集团掌握了大社领导权以后，觉得阵地已经巩固，从此便展开了种种破坏活动。
    他们凭借职权，利用一切机会苛待贫农，减少贫农收入。一九五三年并大社的时候，没有把并社前各小社和个体农民种的秋麦作出分配规定，到麦收的时候，在反动地主、富农分子操纵下，硬性规定按地八劳二比例分红。社员们分到手的二成麦子，于洛九又以“卖爱国粮”的名义扣住不分，企图把贫苦社员饿起来。当时引起了部分社员对国家粮食统购政策不满。他们还用不给贫苦社员派活或少派活的办法，来减少贫苦社员的收入。贫农王纪先在第四生产队（多数是地主、富农），不光不给她派活，她十六岁的姑娘在社里砸了一天土块才给记二分工。贫农社员梁素国，去年一年只摘了十天棉桃，刨了半亩山药。因此，有不少贫农和孤寡户社员生活日渐贫困起来。
    今年春天政府为帮助贫苦农民解决生产困难，发给火光社棉花预定金三千三百六十元，于洛九却不让发放给贫苦社员。后来经过共产党员的坚持斗争，发下了一小部分，但其中有十三户不该享受的富农也得到了棉花预定金。
    火光社的信用部，由于掌握在地主、富农手里，也变成地主、富农剥削、打击贫农的武器了。去冬和今春，国家银行贷款和群众游资存款共达八千三百多元，其中贷给社员的一千八百元中，仅贷给贫农社员三百多元。以于洛九为首有四户反动富农不该贷的也贷了。但贫农社员李文才，家里没有吃的，曾几次找到于洛九，他不仅没有贷给，反而趁机歪曲政策，破坏党和政府同人民群众的关系，说什么：“银行怕你们还不起，指示我们不允许贷给你们贫农。”李文才贷不来款，被迫卖掉了大门，他说：“刚过上了翻身后的好日子，入了社又受上富农的气了。”
    他们还采取一切卑鄙无耻的手段，挑拨离间，破坏团结，打击先进社员和先进队。原来的第五队是团结生产最好的队，曾两次被评为全社的模范队。由于生产搞得好，在巩固和提高社中起着决定性作用。因此这个队成了于洛九反动集团的眼中钉，他们企图进行打击破坏，但总未抓到空隙。去年秋后这一个队划分为第九、第十两个队的时候，按规定有一辆新铁轮车应搭配给第九队使用，可是第十队也想要，因此两个队闹起意见。于洛九觉着这是挑拨的好机会，就对第十队的社员说：“九队自私自利，本位主义太严重，只有一辆新铁轮车，为什么总得归他们使呢？不给使！看他们有啥办法！”他转过脸来又对第九队的社员说：“车随牲口走，牲口配给了九队，新车也就应该归你们，还是你们自己解决去吧！”在他的挑拨下，两个队的矛盾越来越尖锐，生产也因此受到了损失。
    敌人失败了
    尽管反动富农于洛九的两面手法施展得十分巧妙，但是他终归逃不脱人民的眼睛，今年五月的一天，乡总支书记于导先等集中群众意见，写了一份检举信向省公安机关检举了于洛九的罪行。村里广大群众像土地改革中贫苦农民诉苦一样，愤怒地向公安机关派来的工作人员检举和揭发了于洛九的罪恶事实。经过一个多月的调查，完全证明了于洛九是一个钻到党内来一贯干着反党反人民的罪恶活动的阶级敌人；定县县委已把他开除出党，人民政府也依法把他逮捕起来，并且给了他应得的惩处。
