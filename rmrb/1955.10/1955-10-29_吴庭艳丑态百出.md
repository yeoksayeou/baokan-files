Ngô Đình Diệm's Disgraceful Performance
By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent in Vietnam

As expected, with the full support of the United States, Ngô Đình Diệm finally crowned himself "President" on October 26th.

To promote Ngô Đình Diệm, the United States, besides quickly expressing "recognition," has been loudly proclaiming through its propaganda machine that "Ngô Đình Diệm has achieved a brilliant victory."

What kind of "victory" is this exactly? Agence France-Presse, in a dispatch from Saigon on the second day of the so-called "referendum" held by the Ngô Đình Diệm group, stated: "Most observers believe that Ngô Đình Diệm's victory over Bảo Đại is due to a skillfully prepared campaign, the favorable conditions of which were ample resources, especially since his opponent (referring to Bảo Đại) was not in the country." This French news agency "implicitly" and "unintentionally" exposed Ngô Đình Diệm's trickery.

In South Vietnam, there is a radio station that openly proclaims "anti-communism" – the Đại Việt Radio Station. It broadcasts daily reports of the Ngô Đình Diệm group's "referendum." Although these "reports" are far from complete, they have exposed some of the true circumstances of this farce.

Đại Việt Radio Station broadcast that before "seeking public opinion," Ngô Đình Diệm ordered his police and soldiers to disguise themselves and spread throughout the area to monitor the people, threatening them with not allowing them to register for rice rations if they did not vote. These people were also ordered to cast one hundred votes each.

The regulations announced by the Ngô Đình Diệm group stipulated that after "voters" cast their ballots, they had to hand over their identity cards to the polling station to be stamped before completing the task. According to Đại Việt Radio Station, on October 23rd, the Phúc Thọ racetrack polling station in Saigon suddenly announced that the "stamp" was missing. After people cast their votes, they were forced to vote five or six more times continuously. Then, a large truck arrived and transported people to another location to vote, only then were they stamped. People repeatedly acted as voting machines in this way, because if the identity card was not stamped, there was a risk of personal and family harm in the future.

Đại Việt Radio Station said that "concealed houses" were set up in Huế City and Đà Nẵng City, supposedly to facilitate people's "secret" voting. However, these houses were only covered with pieces of cloth, and the cloth was seventy or eighty centimeters above the ground, so the actions of people inside could be seen. The "ballots" issued by the Ngô Đình Diệm group were divided into two halves, one with a red background and an image of Ngô Đình Diệm; the other with a green background and an image of Bảo Đại. During the "voting," half of the ballot was thrown on the ground, and the other half was placed in the box. If anyone threw away the red half, i.e., the one "approving" of Ngô Đình Diệm, they would be immediately arrested or placed on a blacklist. The "concealed houses" in Quảng Trị Province were even more ridiculous, with only one side covered by cloth, and the rest open. Ngô Đình Diệm's police and secret agents stood there, constantly pointing at the voters and saying: "Tear off the green side and throw it on the ground, put the red side in the envelope, do you hear?" The voting place in Thái Bình City, Saigon, was very large, but only three or four people were allowed to enter to vote each time, making them suspect each other of being Ngô Đình Diệm's secret agents. Many school authorities in Saigon and Cholon were ordered to instruct students to vote for Ngô Đình Diệm and "expose" those who did not vote. "Prisoners" held in prisons in Saigon and other parts of South Vietnam were also instructed to vote, gathered together at the time, and the prison guards put the red ballots, which had been torn off in advance, into the boxes. Such things were incredibly strange.

On the day of the vote, many people were arrested because someone threw the red side of the ballot on the ground, or someone threw both the red and green sides of the ballot together into an empty envelope. Ngô Đình Diệm's Ministry of Interior's "Peace News" also admitted on October 24th: "Many people were arrested for disrupting the vote, and one person who threw an empty envelope was arrested."

Although the Ngô Đình Diệm group has taken all kinds of shameless measures, this kind of "voting" has still met with widespread and strong opposition from the people of South Vietnam. In many places, because there were too few people voting, Ngô Đình Diệm's followers had to fabricate the numbers themselves; and they did it very clumsily, resulting in loopholes everywhere. For example, a news item released by the Ngô Đình Diệm group's radio station on October 24th stated: According to preliminary statistics from Saigon, Cholon, and other places, Ngô Đình Diệm has already received votes accounting for 104.75 percent of the total number of votes! According to a report in a dispatch from Agence France-Presse, the number of votes announced in many places was "more than the number of people on the electoral register."

Đại Việt Radio Station said: Saigon and Cholon are the places where the power of the Ngô Đình Diệm regime is most concentrated, but only less than 30 percent of their statistical population were forced to vote, and in other places such as Phan Rang, Quảng Trị, Thừa Thiên, and Tây Nguyên, it was less than 10 percent. However, even in places where there was no voting, Ngô Đình Diệm would soon get the numbers he considered satisfactory.

The more the Ngô Đình Diệm group plays out this ugly drama of "seeking public opinion," the more it exposes its anti-people, anti-democratic, and anti-peace ugly face. The Vietnamese people cannot forgive it. As the Vietnamese People's Daily said: "If he continues to follow this path, he will be more and more deeply hated and resolutely opposed by our people. The true will of our people is: to demand peace, unification, independence, and democracy."

    吴庭艳丑态百出
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    不出所料，吴庭艳在美国的一手支撑之下，终于在十月二十六日自封“总统”了。
    为了替吴庭艳捧场，美国除了赶紧表示“承认”外，它的宣传机器最近大事吹擂，说什么“吴庭艳已经获得辉煌的胜利。”
    这究竟是怎么样的“胜利”呢？法新社在吴庭艳集团举行所谓“公民投票”的第二天，自西贡发出的一则消息中说：“大多数观察家们认为，吴庭艳对保大的胜利，是由于准备得很巧妙的竞选运动的结果，这次竞选运动的有利条件是资力充足，特别是他的对手（指保大）不在国内。”这家法国通讯社“含蓄”而又“不经意”地把吴庭艳的把戏给戳穿了。
    南越有一家公开标榜“反共”的电台——大越广播电台，它每天广播吴庭艳集团的“公民投票”的实况。这些“实况”虽然远不够详尽，但是已经把这幕丑剧的一些真实情况暴露出来了。
    大越电台广播说：吴庭艳在“征求民意”之前，就下令他的警察、士兵改装，散布各处监视人民，并以不投票不准登记买米来威胁人民。这些人并奉命每人投一百张票。
    吴庭艳集团公布的法令规定，“选民”投完票后要把身份证交给投票站盖上图章，才算完成任务。据大越电台说，十月二十三日，西贡福寿跑马场投票站忽然宣布“图章”不见了，人们投完票之后，又被强迫连续投了五、六次票。然后，又开来一辆大卡车，把人们载到另外一个地方去投票，才能给他们盖章。人们就这样反复地充当投票机器，因为身份证上如果未盖章，往后就有身家被害的危险。
    大越电台说，在顺化市和土伦市设有“隐蔽屋”据说是为了便利人民“秘密”投票。可是这种房屋只拿布块遮挡，而且布块离地面都有七、八十公分高，里面人的举动都可以看到。吴庭艳集团制发的“选票”共分两半，一半是红色底版，印有吴庭艳像；另一半是绿色底版，印有保大像。“投票”时是把半张扔到地上，另半张投到箱内。如果有谁把红色的一半，即“赞成”吴庭艳的一张扔了，就马上被抓走或记上黑名单中。广治省的“隐蔽屋”更好笑，只用布块遮住一边，其他地方敞开着。吴庭艳的警察和密探就站在那里，不停地指着投票的人说：“把绿的一边撕下扔到地下，把红的一边放到信封里，听见没有？”西贡所属太平市投票处房子非常大，但是每次只准三、四个人入内投票，使他们互相怀疑是吴庭艳的密探。西贡、堤岸许多学校当局并奉命指令学生给吴庭艳投票和“揭露”不投票的人。关在西贡和南越其他地方的监狱里的“囚犯”，也被指令投票，到时候被集中在一起，由狱卒把事先撕下来的红票投入箱里。诸如此类，无奇不有。
    投票那天，许多人被捕了，原因是有人把票子红色的一边扔在地下、有人把票子红绿两边一起丢掉投空信封。吴庭艳内务部的“和平报”在十月二十四日也承认说：“有许多人因破坏投票被捕，一个投空信封的人叫抓走了。”
    吴庭艳集团虽然采取了种种无耻的手段，但是，这种“投票”仍然遭到南越人民普遍的强烈反对。许多地方因为投票的人太少，吴庭艳分子只好自己来编造数字；而且他们做得非常笨拙，结果处处露出马脚。例如，吴庭艳集团的广播电台十月二十四日发出来的一则消息说：根据西贡、堤岸等地初步统计，吴庭艳已得选票占总票数百分之一百零四点七五！据法新社在一则消息中报道，有许多地方宣布的选票数目“比在选举登记册上的人数多”。
    大越广播电台说：西贡、堤岸是吴庭艳政权力量最集中的地方，但被迫去投票的才占其统计人数百分之三十弱，其他藩郎、广治、承天、西原等地还不到百分之十，但是，即使没有投票的地方，吴庭艳也会很快就得到他认为满意的数目字的。
    吴庭艳集团这种“征求民意”的丑剧愈是扮演下去，它的反人民、反民主、反和平的丑恶面目愈是暴露无遗。越南人民对它是无法宽恕的。正如越南人民报所说的：“倘若他还继续走这一条道路，则将愈加遭到我国人民的深恶痛绝和坚决反对。我国人民的真正意志是：要求和平、统一、独立和民主。”
