Shandong Silk Mill Leaders Disregard Workers' Suffering

To the Editor:

The leadership staff of the local state-owned Shandong Silk Mill exhibit serious capitalist management ideologies. Under the guise of "grasping production," they adopt a cold and ruthless attitude towards the workers' hardships.

According to labor insurance regulations, female workers should be granted 56 days of leave during childbirth, with wages paid during the leave period; however, female workers in this factory cannot enjoy the rest they deserve before and after childbirth. For example, female worker Zhu Xiulan, who was pregnant and about to give birth, had been bleeding for a day on Sunday, but the factory still required her to work the next day. Labor insurance regulations stipulate that female workers who have a miscarriage should be granted a leave of absence of up to 30 days; this factory actually stipulates: "Female workers who have a miscarriage will be granted 15 days of leave, and any period exceeding 15 days will be treated as sick leave." This factory also fails to provide care and consideration for female workers after childbirth. For example, female worker Li Xiaochun was only allowed to lie in the clinic for two hours after giving birth before being sent back to the dormitory; because the dormitory was cold and there was no one to take care of her, she was unable to rest and consequently developed postpartum mental problems.

In this factory, workers are also treated as "violating labor discipline" if they drink water or go to the toilet during production time. The head of the production technology section announced at a meeting: "Except for pregnant women, no one else is allowed to drink water or have a bowel movement after starting the machine; if the machine is stopped because of drinking water or having a bowel movement, it will be considered a violation of operating procedures." The workers said: It's hot, and we can't do without water! The factory director replied: "Drink enough water at mealtimes, and that will be enough!" The management also "mobilized" the workers to include this clause in the "group pledge" and "individual guarantee." This terrible practice has caused the workers undue suffering.

The management staff of this factory also frequently go to the wards to find sick workers to work. They say: Even if two people operate one machine, it's better than not operating the machine at all. Under the influence of this atmosphere, the factory doctors also have a very bad attitude towards sick workers, often arbitrarily saying that the workers are "feigning illness." In April, female worker Lü Lanying gave birth while sick, fainted four times in the workshop, and ate almost nothing for seven consecutive days. When she could no longer persevere, she asked for leave. The doctor suspected that she was lying and gave her an enema to see if she really hadn't eaten anything. As a result, only a small amount of waste was extracted the first time, and nothing came out the second time. As a result, workers are afraid to see a doctor or ask for leave when they are sick.

These bad attitudes of this factory towards the workers have already created a very bad political influence. They should quickly correct these mistakes.

### 山东制丝厂领导人员不关心工人疾苦

    山东制丝厂领导人员不关心工人疾苦编辑同志：
    地方国营山东制丝厂的领导工作人员存在严重的资本主义经营思想。他们在“抓生产”的幌子下，对工人的生活疾苦采取了冷酷无情的态度。
    根据劳动保险条例规定，女工生产时应给假五十六天，产假期间工资照发；可是这个厂的女工在生产前后就享受不到应有的休息。如女工诸秀兰怀孕快要临产，星期日已经流了一天血，第二天厂方还要她上班。劳动保险条例规定女工小产给予三十天以内的产假；这个厂居然擅自规定：“女工小产给假十五天，超过十五天按病假处理”。这个厂对分娩后的女工也丝毫不给以关怀和照顾。如女工李筱春产后只在医务室躺了两小时，就被送回宿舍；因为宿舍冷，无人照顾，得不到休息，结果得了产后疯嘴病。
    这个工厂的工人在生产时间喝水和上厕所，也被当作“违犯劳动纪律”。生产技术科长在大会上宣布：“除孕妇外，其他人在开车后不许喝水和大、小便；如果因为喝水和大、小便而停车，算违犯操作规程。”工人们说：天气热，不喝水不行呀！厂长回答道：“吃饭时水喝足些，完全顶得下来！”管理人员还“发动”工人把这一条订到“小组公约”、“个人保证”中去。这种恶劣的做法，使工人受到了不应有的痛苦。
    这个厂的管理人员还经常到病房去找患病工人上工。他们说：就算两个人开一台车，也比不开车强。在这种风气的影响下，工厂的医生对患病工人的态度也很恶劣，常常武断地说工人“无病装病”。四月间，女工吕兰英带病生产，在车间晕倒过四次，一连七天没有吃什么东西，实在不能坚持工作，才去请假。医生怀疑她撒谎，竟给她灌肠，要看她是不是真的没有吃东西。结果，第一次只灌出少量污物，第二次什么也没有灌出来。这样，工人有病也不敢去瞧病和请假。
    这个工厂对待工人的这些恶劣态度，已经造成很不好的政治影响。他们应该迅速改正这些错误。
