Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 22nd - Preparations are actively underway for construction of China's first modern, huge oil refinery - the Lanzhou Oil Refinery. Currently, a circular railway near the factory area is under intense construction, and the road leading to the factory is also being paved. Drilling workers are drilling sand pits in the vast factory area, and site leveling will begin soon. The construction of this oil refinery will employ mechanized and factory-style methods. More than a dozen processing plants needed for factory-style construction are being designed and will soon commence construction.

The scale of this oil refinery is very large, with more than ten main production workshops. The production process will be highly automated. In the duty room, there will be various automatic control instruments that can reflect production conditions such as flow, velocity, temperature, and pressure. Workers can remotely control production using these instruments.

After the Lanzhou Oil Refinery is completed, it will be able to process a large amount of crude oil annually, refining petroleum products such as aviation gasoline, aviation kerosene, automotive gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil, cylinder oil, spindle oil, etc., to supply the needs of China's transportation industry and industrial production construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 22nd - The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has begun its last winter construction phase.

The civil construction work this winter mainly involves pouring floors, concrete bedding, and laying floors indoors, as well as some scattered finishing work. The amount of earthwork, backfilling, and bricklaying is only about one percent of the winter construction tasks of the past two years.

Winter construction played a decisive role in accelerating the construction progress of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The thermal power plant and auxiliary, chassis, and non-ferrous casting workshops, which were the first to undergo winter construction in 1953, have been put into production or adjusted production. The casting, motorcycle, and body pressing workshops, which underwent winter construction last year, have now also started installing a large amount of mechanical equipment ahead of schedule.

    我国第一座巨大炼油厂在兰州准备施工
    第一汽车制造厂建厂最后一次冬季施工开始
    新华社兰州二十二日电　我国第一座现代化的巨大的炼油厂——兰州炼油厂正积极进行施工前的准备工作。现在，厂区附近的环形铁路正在紧张地施工，通往厂区的公路也在铺设路面。钻探工人们正在广阔的厂区钻探砂坑，不久就将开始平整厂址。这座炼油厂工程将采用机械化、工厂化的方法施工，为工厂化施工所需的十几个加工厂正在设计，很快就可动工建筑。
    这座炼油厂规模很大，共有十多个主要生产车间。生产过程将是高度自动化的，在值班室里有各种能够反映流量、流速、温度、压力等生产情况的自动控制仪表，工人们依靠仪表就可以远距离地操纵生产。
    兰州炼油厂建成后，每年能够处理大量原油，炼制出航空汽油、航空煤油、车用汽油、柴油、润滑油、汽缸油、锭子油等石油产品，供应我国交通运输业和工业生产建设的需要。
    新华社长春二十二日电　第一汽车制造厂已开始建厂中的最后一次冬季施工。
    今年冬季施工的土木建筑工程主要是在室内浇灌地坪、混凝土垫层和铺设地板以及其他一些零星的收尾工程。挖土、填土、砌砖等工程量只等于过去两年冬季施工任务的百分之一左右。
    冬季施工对加速第一汽车制造厂的建厂进度起了决定性的作用。一九五三年第一批进行冬季施工的热电站和辅助、底盘、有色修铸等工场厂房，已投入了生产或调整生产。去年进行冬季施工的铸工、摩托、车身压制等工场厂房，现在也都提前开始安装大量机械设备。
