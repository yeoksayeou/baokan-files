    The Art of Chilean Painter José Venturelli
    Jiang Feng
    An exhibition of works by the famous Chilean painter José Venturelli (including lithographs, watercolors, sketches, oil paintings, etc.) is being held in Beijing. I sincerely congratulate the success of this exhibition.
    After seeing this exhibition, I felt a kind of charm attracting me, urging me to visit it again and again. Among them, many works, especially the two sets of lithographs with woodcut flavor, "January 28th" and "There is Still Hope Today," left a deep impression on me. The former depicts the bloody massacre that occurred on January 28, 1946, when Chilean police shot at a workers' demonstration parade, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries. The latter exposes the crimes of the pro-imperialist Chilean dictators in imprisoning, exiling, and torturing patriotic people. In these works, the author is filled with passionate emotion, powerfully denouncing the cruelty and tyranny of the reactionary rulers, and praising the heroic and unyielding fighting will of the Chilean working people. From these works, we can appreciate that every image, even every black and white area, and every line seems to be issuing a just cry of deep sympathy for the victims and extreme anger towards the executioners. Venturelli's feeling, which is linked to the life and death of the working people, and his profound understanding of life, is the foundation for the success of his creation of these two sets of lithographs, and also the source of the works' touching power.
    Many of Venturelli's works are very intensely moving. In addition to the reasons mentioned above, this should be attributed to the unique expressive techniques he adopted in order to achieve a high degree of generalization of the real life he depicted. The main feature of this technique is that when processing the picture, he boldly omits the dispensable secondary images, and even deletes the characters and backgrounds that are not very relevant to the theme, while emphasizing and exaggerating the most important plot and the most necessary characters, so that the theme of the work is centrally and clearly highlighted on the screen. For example, in one of the "January 28th" series of paintings, "Mother," the foreground is a coffin of the victim placed upright. The coffin lid is painted as a whole piece of white, and the side is a whole piece of black. Close to the back of the coffin stands a woman in black holding a child, with a sad expression on her face. The rest of the screen is blank, with nothing at all. Because of this, the theme of the work appears very simple and concentrated, and the strong black and white contrast further enhances this effect. Venturelli's prints mostly use this technique to shape images and organize the picture to express the theme of the work. This technique of shaping images and organizing the picture shows that the author has a strong ability to generalize life, and is good at selecting the most representative things from complex life phenomena.
    Compact composition is also a characteristic of Venturelli's artistic expression. In order to meet the requirements of compact composition, he often compresses the characters and things in the painting together. For example, in one of the four paintings in the "January 28th" series, titled "Death in the Square," the author deliberately shortened the distance between the shooter and the shot. Although this is not possible in reality, the result of this treatment makes the conflict depicted in the painting more concentrated and tense, and therefore more realistic and moving. Venturelli's compact compositional form was produced under such requirements.
    The above-mentioned expressive techniques are actually just general laws of artistic expression, and there is nothing new or special. However, although these laws are understood and approved by everyone in theory, they are easily forgotten in practice. Some of our painters often do not distinguish between the primary and secondary aspects of the things they depict, do not make choices, and do not dare to exaggerate and emphasize, resulting in complex and flat pictures, which greatly affects the clarity of the theme of the work, lacks the power to attract and move the audience, and opens the door to naturalistic artistic tendencies. This shortcoming exists in our artistic creation today, and it is quite common.
    The many watercolors and lithographs created by Venturelli in China that reflect the life of the Chinese people are somewhat different in style from his previous bold and strong works. Especially the watercolors he painted with ink and rice paper, due to the absorption of certain expressive techniques of Chinese freehand brushwork, appear light, elegant and full of wit. The lotus flowers in the two watercolor paintings, "Sweat and Dream" and "Courtyard in Beijing," although they are hasty depictions with only a few strokes, fully express the fresh and watery feeling of the lotus leaves and flowers. In the two watercolor paintings "Portrait of a Girl" and "Summer Storm," which are praised by many viewers, the author uses concise colors and lines to very smoothly capture the general outline and essentials of the objects. The expressive techniques of being rough but detailed and using natural brushstrokes have reached an astonishing level here.
    Venturelli also has unique features in the use of color. The lithograph "I'm Getting Married Tomorrow" is an example that can be used to illustrate this point. The girl's head, face, hands, and clothes are all beige, and the background is almost all beige. Only the background behind the head is deliberately left blank, so that the head is exposed. The girl is holding a dark red flower in her hand. Due to the blank space and the red flower, not only is the color sense of the picture enriched, but also the girl's head and hands, which the author intends to emphasize, are interestingly highlighted on the picture. The use of color in another lithograph, "Girl," is even more ingenious. On the dark blue background, black is used to paint the hair and the patterns on the clothes. These two dark colors, which are different but not significantly different, vividly set off the girl's yellow face and hands. The two eyes, which are clearly black and white, appear even brighter and become the most eye-catching and lively part of the entire picture, that is, the entire image. After seeing these two paintings, we understand that Venturelli's use of color, like his prints that are good at using black and white, ultimately aims to highlight the theme.
    Venturelli's works have an original style and are loved by people. Because he has only been in China for a short time, and because he is busy with work and not very healthy, he is not familiar enough with the life of the Chinese people, so the energetic and vibrant atmosphere of the Chinese people is not reflected much in his works. In my opinion, this can be said to be a shortcoming of some works. But I believe that Comrade Venturelli will definitely be able to overcome this weakness in his future creative practice.

    智利画家何塞·万徒勒里的艺术
    江丰
    智利名画家何塞·万徒勒里的作品（包括石版画、水彩画、素描、油画等）展览会在北京举行。我衷心祝贺这个展览会的成功。
    看了这个展览会，感到有一种魅力在吸引着我，驱使我一次又一次地去参观，其中有许多作品，特别是“一月二十八日”和“今天仍有希望”那两组带有木刻风味的石版画，留给我的印象很深。前一组描写一九四六年一月二十八日发生的智利警察枪击工人示威游行队伍死伤数百人的血案；后一组揭露亲帝国主义的智利独裁者对于爱国人民的监禁、放逐和施加酷刑的罪恶行为。在这些作品中，作者充满着激动的感情，有力地控诉了反动统治者的残忍和暴虐，歌颂了智利劳动人民英勇不屈的斗争意志。我们从这些作品中可以体会到，每一个形象，甚至每一块黑白和每一根线条，都似乎在发出对于受难者深厚同情和对于刽子手的极端愤怒的正义呼声。万徒勒里这种同劳动人民的生死命运连结在一起的感情，以及对于生活的深刻理解，就是他创作这两组石版画成功的基础，也是作品感人力量的来源。
    万徒勒里的许多作品非常强烈动人，其所以能够如此，除了上述原因之外，应该归功于他为了使他描写的现实生活达到高度概括而采取了独特的表现手法。这种手法主要的特点是：处理画面时，大胆地省略了可有可无的次要形象，甚至删去同主题不很有关的人物背景，而把最主要的情节和最必要的人物强调地夸张地描绘出来，使作品的主题集中地、明确地突出在画面上。例如“一月二十八日”组画之一“母亲”这幅画，前景是直放着的一口受难者的棺材，棺材盖子被画成一整块的白色，侧面又是整块的黑色，紧靠棺材的后面，站着一个怀抱孩子、脸露悲痛情绪的黑衣妇女，画面其余部分则全是空白，一无所有；正因为如此，作品的主题显得非常单纯和集中，并且由于强烈的黑白对比，更增强了这一效果。万徒勒里的版画，大都是用这种手法去塑造形象和组织画面而表现作品的主题的。这种塑造形象和组织画面的手法，说明了作者对生活的概括力很强，善于从复杂的生活现象中选择最有代表意义的事物。
    构图紧凑，也是万徒勒里艺术表现的一个特色。为了达到构图紧凑的要求，他常常把画中的人物和事物压缩在一起。例如“一月二十八日”组画之一、题为“广场上的死”的四幅中的一幅，作者故意将枪击者和被枪击者的距离缩得很短，虽然事实不可能如此，但是这样处理的结果，却使画中所描写的冲突更加集中，更加紧张，因而也就更加显得真实动人。万徒勒里作品的紧凑的构图形式，就是在这样的要求下产生的。
    以上所说的那些表现手法，实际上不过是艺术表现的一般法则，并没有什么新奇和特殊，但这些法则，在理论上固然是大家都懂得和赞成的，而一到实践中就很容易被忘掉，我们有些画家对描写的事物往往不分主次，不加取舍，不敢夸张和强调，致使画面复杂，平板无奇，大大影响了作品主题的明确性，缺乏吸引观众和感动观众的力量，并给自然主义的艺术倾向开了大门。这种缺点，在我们今天的艺术创作上是存在的，而且相当普遍。
    万徒勒里在中国创作的那许多反映中国人民生活的水彩画和石版画，在风格上，同他以前粗壮强烈的作品有些不同，特别是他用水墨和宣纸画成的水彩画，由于吸取了中国写意画的某些表现技巧，显得轻快潇洒并且富有风趣。“汗与梦”和“北京的庭院”两幅水彩画中的荷花，虽是寥寥几笔的急就描写，却把荷叶和花朵的那种鲜嫩含水的感觉充分表现了出来。被很多观众称赞的“女孩像”和“夏天的暴风雨”这两幅水彩画，作者用简练的色彩和线条，非常流畅地抓住了对象的大体和要处，那粗中有细和用笔自然的表现技巧，在这里已达到令人惊叹的程度。
    在用色方面，万徒勒里也有独到之处，石版画“我明天结婚”便是可以用来说明这一点的一个例子。画中少女的头脸、双手和衣服都是米黄色，背景也几乎都是米黄色，只是头部后面的底色故意留出一块空白，这样，把头部显露出来。少女手里拿着一朵深红色的花。由于空白和红花，不仅丰富了画面的色彩感觉，而且作者企图着重表现的少女的头和手，也有趣地突出在画面上了。另一幅石版画“女孩”，用色更是巧妙，在深蓝的底色上，用黑色画成头发和衣服的花纹，这两种有区别而区别不显著的深暗的颜色，把女孩黄色的脸和手鲜明地衬托了出来，黑白分明的那两只眼睛，更显得明亮，成了整个画面也就是整个形象的最触目、最有生命的部分。看了这两幅画，使我们理解，万徒勒里的用色和他善用黑白表现的版画同样，最终目的是为了突出主题。
    万徒勒里的作品有独创的风格，令人喜爱。由于他来到中国还不久，并且由于工作忙碌而身体不大健康的缘故，对中国人民的生活还不够熟悉，所以中国人民那种精力饱满、生气勃勃的气象，在作品上反映出来的还不多。在我看来，这可以说是有些作品美中不足的地方。但是我相信，万徒勒里同志在今后的创作实践中一定能够克服这方面的弱点的。
