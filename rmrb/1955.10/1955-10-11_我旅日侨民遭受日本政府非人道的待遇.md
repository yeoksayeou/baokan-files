Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 10th: According to a report in the "Akahata" newspaper on September 27th, Chinese nationals residing in Japan who are detained in a "detention center" run by the Immigration Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Justice in Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Prefecture, are subjected to inhumane treatment.

The "Akahata" newspaper stated: The so-called "detention center" is actually part of a prison. The internal facilities are extremely poor, and maggots are often found crawling around. The bathing pool is only about three square meters in area, but more than one hundred and several dozen people bathe there, so it is very dirty. There is no full-time doctor in the "detention center." When someone gets sick, they are locked in a single room for isolation, and no one takes care of them. When those "detained" raise questions about food and medical treatment, the "detention center" authorities say "they won't die" and ignore them altogether. Those "detained" are not allowed to send letters to the outside world, nor are they allowed to meet with people from the outside.

The "detention center" authorities also arbitrarily inflict torture on Chinese nationals. One of the "detained" accidentally broke a window baffle. About forty security officers forcibly handcuffed him and the representative who pleaded for him, subjecting them to three weeks of illegal treatment. On one occasion, when the "detained" demanded an end to the beating of a "detainee" named Zheng Jinyuan, the "detention center" authorities dispatched dozens of security officers who brutally beat them with batons, injuring more than ten people. In order to cover up the truth, the "detention center" authorities instructed criminal police to compile investigation reports based solely on information provided by the "detention center" itself, and to publish wildly false so-called "truths" about the matter in the newspapers.

    我旅日侨民遭受日本政府非人道的待遇
    新华社十日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”九月二十七日报道，被拘留在日本法务省出入国境管理局设在静冈县滨松市的一个“收容所”里的中国旅日侨民，遭受非人道的待遇。
    “赤旗报”说：所谓“收容所”，实际上是监狱的一部分。内部设备非常恶劣，时常发现蛆虫在爬。浴池面积仅有三平方公尺左右，但有一百数十人洗澡，所以非常肮脏。“收容所”里没有专职的医生，有了病就被关进单人房间隔离起来，也没有人看护。“收容所”方面碰到被“收容”的人提出关于伙食和诊疗问题时，便说“死不了”，一概不管。被“收容”的人要向外面写信也不给投寄，并且不准和外面的人见面。
    “收容所”当局还任意对中国侨民施用私刑。有一个被“收容”的人因为不小心碰坏了窗户的挡板，竟出现约四十名警备官把他和替他求情的代表二人都强行带上手铐，给予他们三个星期的非法待遇。有一次，被“收容”的人要求停止殴打名叫郑金元的被“收容”者，“收容所”当局竟出动数十名警备官，用警棒凶殴他们，打伤了十多个人。“收容所”当局为了掩盖真实情况，要刑事警察只根据“收容所”方面所说的情况编写调查报告；并且在报纸上胡乱发表事情的所谓“真相”。
