    Large quantities of newly harvested industrial raw materials such as cotton, cottonseed, and tobacco leaves from rural areas across the country have begun to be transported to Shanghai. Shanghai's light industrial production is becoming more active as new raw materials arrive in a steady stream.
    In early October, over 400,000 dan of new cotton had been shipped to Shanghai from cotton-producing areas in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces. Shanghai's cotton textile factories have already begun using the new cotton for spinning. Because this year's new cotton is thoroughly sun-dried, carefully sorted, and has a pure white color, soft texture, and long fibers, the yarn spun from it is of very high quality. Many Shanghai yarn mills have already formulated plans to conserve cotton in the fourth quarter, and strive to increase cotton yarn production by more than 11,000 pieces compared to the same period last year. As of October 14th, over 100,000 bales of new cottonseed had been shipped to Shanghai from Songjiang, Nantong, Haimen, Chongming and other places. Some Shanghai oil mills have already started using the new cottonseed to extract oil. This year's new cottonseed has large and plump kernels, with an oil content of over 18 jin per 100 jin of cottonseed, an increase of more than one jin compared to previous years, but the moisture content is more than one jin lower than last year. Shanghai's cigarette factories have also begun to use new tobacco leaves shipped from Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang and other provinces for production. Workers in various factories have launched inter-factory labor competitions and have taken concrete measures to ensure improved product quality. (Our correspondent in Shanghai)
    Newly harvested industrial raw materials such as cotton, tobacco leaves, hemp, cottonseed, and sesame from economic crop areas in Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Anhui provinces are being steadily transported to Tianjin. Tianjin's textile, cigarette, oil extraction, rope and other factories have successively begun production using the new raw materials since September. The quality of industrial raw materials shipped to Tianjin from various economic crop areas this year is generally higher than in the past. In the past month, more than 110,000 dan of new cotton shipped to Tianjin from cotton-producing areas in Hebei province have had fiber lengths of over one inch, with pure white color and reduced water and impurity content compared to the past. Using such cotton for spinning can reduce yarn breakage in the roving frame. Fine yarns spun from new cotton by the state-owned Tianjin No. 3 and No. 4 Cotton Textile Factories have exceeded the quality indicators stipulated by the state. The oil content of cottonseed this year is also higher than in the past. The new tobacco leaves shipped from Henan and other places have high oil content and uniform thickness.

    各地农村新收的工业原料大批运到上海天津
    各地农村丰收后的棉花、棉籽、烟叶等工业原料已经开始大批运到上海。上海市的轻工业生产正随着新原料的源源到达而更趋活跃。
    十月上旬，从河北、河南、山东等省产棉区运来上海的新棉已达四十多万担。现在上海各棉纺织厂已经开始用新棉纺纱。由于今年的新棉晒得透，拣得净，棉色洁白松软，纤维长，所以纺出的纱质量很高。现在上海许多纱厂已经订出第四季度节约用棉计划，并争取在今年第四季度要比去年同时期增产棉纱一万一千件以上。到十月十四日为止，从松江、南通、海门、崇明等地运来上海的新棉籽已达十多万包。现在上海部分油脂厂已经开始用新棉籽榨油。今年的新棉籽颗粒大而饱满，每百斤棉籽含油量高达十八斤多，比往年增加一斤以上，但水份却比去年降低一斤多。上海市各卷烟工厂也开始用从河南、山东、安徽、浙江等省运来的新烟叶生产。各厂的工人们展开了厂际劳动竞赛，并采取具体措施，保证提高产品质量。（本报驻上海记者）
    河北、河南、山东、安徽等省经济作物地区今年新收的棉花、烟叶、麻、棉籽、芝麻等工业原料，源源向天津调运。天津市的纺织、卷烟、榨油、麻绳等工厂，从九月份以来已经先后开始用新原料生产。今年各经济作物区运来天津的工业原料，质量一般都比过去高。在最近一个月内，从河北省各产棉区运来天津的十一万多担新棉花，纤维长度都在一吋以上，色泽洁白，含水、含杂量比过去减少。用这样的棉花纺纱，可以减少细纱断头。国营天津第三、第四棉纺织厂用新棉纺的细纱，都超过了国家规定的质量指标。今年棉籽的含油量也比过去高。从河南等地运来的新烟叶，油分大，叶片厚薄均匀。
