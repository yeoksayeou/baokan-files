    Editorial: The 1956 Annual Plan Must Be Well-Prepared
    Recently, various departments and provinces/cities are drafting their respective departmental and local plans based on the control figures of the 1956 National Economic Plan issued by the state. The quality of the 1956 annual plan will significantly impact the completion of the Five-Year Plan.
    China's first Five-Year Plan has been underway for nearly three years. During these three years, China's national economy has developed significantly, proving that the various provisions of the Five-Year Plan are correct and its targets are achievable. However, saying that our first Five-Year Plan can be completed does not mean that we can relax our efforts in the future. On the contrary, the tasks of the latter two years of the Five-Year Plan are even more arduous. Only by making significant efforts based on the achievements already made in the first three years can we ensure the timely completion of the Five-Year Plan. When we say that the Five-Year Plan can be completed, it does not mean that the completion of every target is without problems. In the latter two years, we must further improve our work in all aspects, overcome weaknesses, and solve existing problems to effectively ensure the completion and strive for the over-fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan. It is evident that the latter two years of the Five-Year Plan, especially 1956, are crucial for its completion.
    The state plan is a concrete program of action for the people of the whole country. In particular, the annual plan, once approved by the state, is to be implemented immediately. If the 1956 annual plan is well-prepared, we will be able to fully utilize various favorable factors, mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, overcome difficulties in our path, and ensure the realization and strive for the early realization of the Five-Year Plan. Conversely, if this annual plan is poorly prepared, if the plan itself is backward and incompatible with the requirements of the Five-Year Plan, then we will not be able to guarantee the completion of the Five-Year Plan. This is the problem before us. Therefore, the Party and the state have put forward the requirement to all departments and provinces/cities that they must prepare a good draft of the 1956 annual plan.
    The Party and the state require that all departments and provinces/cities must first, as far as possible, set the various targets of the 1956 annual plan more proactively, so that they are adapted to the requirements of the Five-Year Plan.
    It is estimated that the national capital construction investment will complete about 52 percent in the first three years, leaving about 48 percent to be completed in the latter two years. If we add some new projects using the funds saved after practicing strict economy, then the actual investment to be completed in the latter two years will exceed the investment completed in the first three years. The total industrial output value is expected to increase by 62 percent in the first three years. In the latter two years, the production volume must increase by more than 22 percent compared to the estimate for 1955 (some industrial departments, such as the Ministry of Light Industry, must increase by 27 percent) under the conditions of adding new types of products and expanding raw material resources in order to complete the Five-Year Plan. In terms of agricultural production, since grain production only increased by about 28 billion catties and cotton production hardly increased in the first three years, it is necessary to increase grain production by 30 billion catties and cotton by 6.6 million dan in the latter two years in order to complete the Five-Year Plan. In the latter two years, the tasks of some indicators in transportation, commerce, culture, education, and healthcare are also very heavy. Based on the above situation, if we do not actively improve the various indicators of the 1956 plan, then either we will have to reduce the indicators of the Five-Year Plan, or we will have to push many tasks to 1957. Pushing many tasks to 1957 would actually put some indicators of the Five-Year Plan in a potentially unachievable situation. Obviously, these are not permissible.
    Is it possible for us to set the targets of the 1956 plan more proactively? It should be affirmed that such a possibility fully exists.
    Due to the promulgation of the Five-Year Plan and its endorsement by the broad masses of the people, the victorious development of the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, the widespread and in-depth development of the increase production and practice economy movement, the correct implementation of the policy of fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales of grain, as well as other policies of the Party and the state, the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country for completing the Five-Year Plan has been greatly enhanced and will continue to be enhanced. This enthusiasm is the main driving force for promoting the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation. Relying on this enthusiasm, we can overcome various difficulties, eliminate unfavorable factors, and complete relatively proactive plan targets.
    The agricultural harvest in 1955 was better, and the level of industrial technology also improved to some extent. Industrial production in 1956 will likely achieve greater development. With the continued implementation of the principle of comprehensive economy, the increase in fiscal revenue, and the continuous expansion of design and construction forces, capital construction investment in 1956 will likely achieve greater growth. This will not only ensure the timely or early construction of many projects but also promote the development of heavy industry production. The development of industry, the increase in the supply of agricultural production materials, can also promote the development of agriculture. On the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production and the expansion of the scale of capital construction, as well as the potential growth of import and export trade, the market situation will inevitably be active, and transportation will also increase.
    1956 will be a year of great progress in the cause of socialist transformation. The nationwide upsurge of agricultural cooperativization has already begun. Such a great socialist revolution movement in the countryside cannot but have a broad and profound impact on all aspects of the national economy and powerfully promote the development of the national economy. The socialist transformation of private industry and commerce will also make new progress in 1956, which will also play a certain role in the development of the national economy.
    The above are all the basis on which we can set the targets of the 1956 plan more proactively.
    In order to set the plan more proactively, we must criticize various conservative ideas. The main source of conservative ideas lies in the fact that some comrades do not see the new situations that will appear in the economic life of 1956 and do not see various favorable factors. Of course, some difficulties in the economic life of 1956 will still arise. We should have a full estimate and sufficient preparation for the possible difficulties. However, the basic situation that the economic life of 1956 will be relatively active is definite. We have the possibility to utilize various favorable factors, take various active measures, and overcome various difficulties. The ideas and practices of exaggerating difficulties and bowing to difficulties are completely wrong.
    Therefore, all departments and provinces/cities must strengthen the analysis and research of various situations, discover and utilize the positive factors in politics and economy, discover and overcome the weak links in the plan; must carefully examine the various norms, study the possibility of improving the norms, and eliminate the phenomena of norm disorder and norm lagging; must, according to the situation of their own departments or regions, take into account the situation of other departments and other regions, and make overall plans and give consideration to various economic components, do a good job in balancing various plan targets, and avoid disconnections between each other; must formulate specific measures to ensure the realization of the plan targets.
    At the same time, the Party and the state require all departments and provinces/cities to continue to implement the instructions of the Party and the state on opposing waste and practicing strict economy, and at the same time, must strive to improve the quality of capital construction and production, and oppose the wrong practice of saving by reducing quality. When drafting the 1956 annual plan, all departments and all regions should, in accordance with the spirit of comprehensive economy and the actual experience of economy in 1955, carefully calculate and directly stipulate the potential for economy in various aspects within the various plan targets, so as to urge its realization and make economy a regular system.
    A serious problem in current capital construction and industrial production is poor quality. If this problem is not solved, it will not only hinder the development of production but also cause serious social waste, which is contrary to the policy of opposing waste and practicing strict economy. In order to correctly implement the policy of economy, all departments and all provinces/cities must, when drafting the 1956 plan, correctly stipulate the economy plan from a comprehensive perspective and at the same time prepare a plan to ensure quality, so as to ensure that the state's construction funds are saved and the cost of products is reduced under the premise of constantly improving quality.
    The Party and the state also require all departments and all provinces/cities to prepare a plan for the trial production and production of new types of industrial products. At present, there are too few new types of industrial products, which is not only an important problem affecting the speed of industrial production but also an important problem affecting the entire economic and technological development. In 1956, we must earnestly strengthen this aspect of the work and earnestly prepare the plan for the trial production and production of new types of products in 1956.
    The large-scale development of the agricultural cooperativization movement has put forward many new requirements for industry, commerce, transportation, and culture and education. When drafting the plan, all departments should try to effectively organize the forces of all parties and meet the needs of the agricultural cooperativization cause as much as possible.
    In terms of labor, it is necessary to continue to streamline institutions and resettle redundant personnel, strictly control the increase of personnel, and rationally use manpower in accordance with the instructions of the State Council. The employees that various enterprises and institutions need to increase should first be adjusted within the total number of existing employees (including the private industrial and commercial personnel arranged in a unified manner); the personnel graduated from secondary vocational schools and technical worker training classes and the production preparation personnel for the start-up of new enterprises must be included in the labor force plan.
    The drafting time for the 1956 annual plan is very tight. All departments and all provinces/cities must allocate the necessary forces and seize the time to carry it out. All departments and all regions should regard the work of drafting the 1956 plan as an important task, quickly include it in the work agenda, and strengthen the specific leadership over this work.

### 一九五六年的年度计划必须编好

    一九五六年的年度计划必须编好
    最近各个部门、各个省市正在根据国家颁发的一九五六年度国民经济计划的控制数字，编制本部门、本地方的计划草案。一九五六年度计划编制得怎样，将对五年计划的完成起重大的影响。
    我国第一个五年计划已经执行了将近三年。在这三年里，我国国民经济已经有了很大的发展，并且证明了五年计划的各项规定是正确的，各项指标是可以完成的。但是，我们说我国第一个五年计划是可以完成的，这决不是说今后就可以不花什么力气了；恰恰相反，五年计划的后两年，任务是更加繁重的，只有在前三年已经取得的成就的基础上作重大的努力，才能保证五年计划的按期完成。我们说五年计划可以完成，也并不是说每一个指标的完成都没有问题了，我们必须在后两年中进一步地提高各个方面的工作，克服那些薄弱的环节，解决那些存在的问题，才能有效地保证五年计划的完成并争取超额完成。可见五年计划的后两年特别是一九五六年，是完成五年计划极关紧要的年度。
    国家计划是全国人民行动的具体纲领，特别是年度的计划，经国家批准之后，是要立即执行的。如果一九五六年度的计划编制得好，我们就能够充分地利用各种有利的因素，动员全国人民的积极性和创造性，克服在我们前进道路上的困难，保证五年计划的实现，并争取其提前实现。相反，如果这个年度的计划编制得不好，计划本身就是一个落后的、同五年计划要求不相适应的计划，那末，我们也就不能保证五年计划的完成。摆在我们面前的问题就是这样。因此，党和国家向各部门和各省市提出了必须编好一九五六年度的计划草案的要求。
  党和国家要求各部门和各省市首先必须尽可能地把一九五六年度计划的各项指标定得更加积极些，使之适应于五年计划的要求。
    据计算，全国基本建设投资额前三年预计完成百分之五十二左右，还有百分之四十八左右需要在后两年完成，如果把厉行节约以后运用节省出来的资金新增加的一些项目计算进去，那末，后两年实际应该完成的投资额将超过前三年所完成的投资额。工业总产值预计前三年增长了百分之六十二，后两年必须在增加新种类产品和扩大原料资源的条件下，使生产量比一九五五年的预计再增长百分之二十二以上（有的工业部门如轻工业部则必须增长百分之二十七），才能完成五年计划。农业生产方面，由于前三年粮食只增产二百八十亿斤左右，棉花几乎没有增产，因此后两年要增产三百亿斤粮食和六百六十万担棉花，才能完成五年计划。后两年，运输业、商业、文化教育和保健事业等方面的某些指标的任务，也是十分繁重的。根据以上情况，如果我们不去积极地提高一九五六年计划的各项指标，那末，或者就要削减五年计划的指标，或者就要把许多任务推到一九五七年去。而把许多任务推到一九五七年去，这实际上就将使五年计划的某些指标处在可能完不成的情况下面。很明显，这些都是不能容许的。
    我们有没有可能把一九五六年的计划指标定得积极些呢？应该肯定，这种可能性是充分存在的。
    由于五年计划的公布和得到广大人民的拥护，肃清反革命斗争的胜利开展，增产节约运动的广泛深入，粮食定产、定购、定销政策以及党和国家的其他政策正确地贯彻实施，已经大大提高而且将继续提高全国人民对于完成五年计划的积极性。这种积极性是推动社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业的主要动力。依靠这种积极性，就可以克服各种困难，消除不利因素，完成比较积极的计划指标。
    一九五五年农业收成较好，工业技术水平也有某些提高，一九五六年工业生产将有可能得到较大的发展；随着全面节约的方针的继续贯彻执行，财政收入的增加，以及设计、施工力量的不断壮大，一九五六年基本建设的投资将有可能得到较大的增长。这样，不仅可以保证许多工程按期或提前施工，而且可以促进重工业生产的发展。工业的发展，对农业生产资料供应的增加，又可以促进农业的发展。在工农业生产发展和基本建设规模扩大的基础上，以及进出口贸易有可能增长的情况下，市场情况必将活跃，运输也将有所增加。
    一九五六年将是社会主义改造事业大进步的一年。全国农业合作化的高潮已经开始。这样一个伟大的农村中的社会主义革命运动，不可能不对国民经济各个方面起广泛的深刻的影响，有力地推动国民经济的发展。一九五六年私营工商业的社会主义改造的工作也将有新的进步，这对国民经济的发展也将起一定的作用。
    以上这些，都是我们可以把一九五六年计划指标定得积极些的根据。
    为了把计划定得积极些，必须批判各种保守思想。保守思想的主要来源，就是在于有些同志看不到一九五六年经济生活中将要出现的新的情况，看不到各种有利因素。当然，一九五六年经济生活中某些困难也还是会出现的；对可能发生的困难，应该有充分的估计和足够的准备。但是，一九五六年的经济生活比较活跃的这个基本形势是确定了的；我们有可能去利用各种有利因素，采取各种积极的措施，克服各种困难。那种夸大困难，向困难低头的想法和做法，是完全错误的。
    因此，各部门、各省市必须加强对各方面情况的分析研究工作，发现政治和经济的积极因素，加以利用，发现计划中的薄弱环节，加以克服；必须认真审查各项定额，研究改进定额的可能性，消除定额混乱和定额落后的现象；必须根据本部门或本地区的情况，照顾其他部门、其他地方的情况，并统筹兼顾各种经济成份，做好各种计划指标的平衡工作，避免彼此脱节；必须制定具体的措施，以保证计划指标的实现。
    同时，党和国家要求各部门和各省市继续贯彻执行党和国家关于反对浪费、厉行节约的指示，同时必须努力提高基本建设和生产的质量，反对用降低质量的方法来进行节约的错误作法。各个部门、各个地方在编制一九五六年度计划草案的时候，都应该根据全面节约的精神和一九五五年节约的实际经验，精打细算，把各方面节约的潜力直接规定在各种计划指标之内，以督促其实现，并使节约成为经常的制度。
    当前基本建设和工业生产中的一个严重问题是质量不好。这一个问题不解决，不仅将妨碍生产的发展，而且将造成严重的社会性的浪费，这同反对浪费、厉行节约的方针是相违背的。为了正确地贯彻节约的方针，各部门、各省市在编制一九五六年计划草案的时候，必须从全面的观点出发，正确地规定节约计划，同时编好保证质量的计划，以保证在不断地提高质量的前提下，节约国家的建设资金和降低产品的成本。
    党和国家还要求各部门和各省市，必须编好新种类工业产品的试制和生产的计划。在目前，工业的新种类产品太少，不仅是影响工业生产速度提高的一个重要问题，而且是影响整个经济发展和技术发展的一个重要问题。一九五六年必须切实加强这一方面的工作，切实编好一九五六年的新种类产品的试制和生产计划。
    农业合作化运动的大规模展开，向工业、商业、运输业以及文化教育事业各个方面提出许多新的要求，各部门在编制计划的时候，都应该设法有效地组织各方面的力量，尽可能地满足农业合作化事业的需要。
    在劳动方面，必须根据国务院的指示，继续精简机构和安置多余的人员，严格控制人员的增加，合理地使用人力。各企业、事业单位需要增加的职工，首先应该在现有职工总人数（包括统筹安排的私营工商业人员）内进行调剂；必须把中等专业学校和技术工人训练班毕业的人员以及为新企业开工的生产准备人员纳入劳动力计划以内。
    一九五六年度计划草案的编制时间是很紧迫的。各个部门、各个省市必须抽出必要的力量，抓紧时间进行。各部门、各地方应该把编制一九五六年计划草案的工作当作一项重要任务，迅速列入工作日程，并加强对这一工作的具体领导。
