    "Dunhuang Art Exhibition" Opens
    The "Dunhuang Art Exhibition" opened on the 9th at the Fengxian Hall of the Palace Museum in Beijing.

    The exhibits include more than 500 items, such as copied murals, painted sculptures, and photographs. These are all important works of art currently preserved in the Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang.

    The Mogao Grottoes artworks demonstrate the evolution and development of classical Chinese art from the Jin, Wei, to Song, and Yuan dynasties—from the 4th to the 14th centuries. At that time, artists skillfully used traditional artistic techniques through Buddhist stories to create artistic masterpieces that were rich in national style and realism. The murals and painted sculptures of the Tang Dynasty are particularly outstanding, among which the "Vimalakirti Sutra Transformation," "The Contest of Magic Powers between Raudraksha and Śāriputra," "Offering Chariot and Horses," and the patterns of the caisson ceilings are the most outstanding creations of Dunhuang painting art.

    At the exhibition, there is a cave model of six meters square, which is built according to the original state of Cave No. 285 of the Mogao Grottoes, and it took two years for the art workers of the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute to meticulously copy it. In 1925, the American imperialist element Warner attempted to steal all the murals in this most complete existing cave. However, due to the resolute opposition of the local people, these precious artistic heritages were protected. The murals in the cave are representative works of the Western Wei period, and there are inscriptions of the years of painting from the fourth and fifth years of the Datong reign.

    The "Dunhuang Art Exhibition" is jointly organized by the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute and the Palace Museum. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “敦煌艺术展览”开幕
    “敦煌艺术展览”九日在北京故宫博物院奉先殿开幕。
    展品包括临摹的壁画、彩塑和照片等五百多件。这些都是现在在敦煌莫高窟保存的重要艺术品。
    莫高窟艺术品显示了晋、魏至宋、元间——从四世纪到十四世纪——我国古典艺术演变和发展的情况，是当时艺术匠师们通过佛教故事，巧妙地运用传统的艺术技术，创造了富有民族风格和现实主义的艺术杰作。唐代的壁画、彩塑尤为出色，其中“维摩变”、“劳度叉斗圣图”、“供养车马图”和藻井的图案等，都是敦煌绘画艺术最优秀的创作。
    在展览会上有一座六公尺见方的洞窟模型，是按照莫高窟第二八五号洞窟原状装制的，经敦煌文物研究所美术工作者辛勤地摹绘了两年才完成。一九二五年美帝国主义分子华尔纳曾企图将这个现存最完整的洞窟中壁画全部盗走，由于当地人民坚决反对，才保护了这些珍贵的艺术遗产。窟内的壁画是西魏时期的代表作品，并有大统四年和五年绘制时的题记。
