Perfectly Implement the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party

The recently held Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party had two agenda items: one was the issue of agricultural cooperativization, and the other was the issue of convening the Eighth National Congress of the Party. After discussion at the meeting, the plenary session unanimously adopted the "Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperativization" and the "Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Convening the Eighth National Congress of the Party."

The "Resolution on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperativization" was adopted based on the report "On the Issue of Agricultural Cooperativization" by Comrade Mao Zedong on July 31, 1955. In this report, Comrade Mao Zedong correctly analyzed the current situation of class struggle in the country, sharply criticized the right-leaning thoughts in rural work, and provided programmatic instructions and an overall plan for the scale and steps of national agricultural cooperativization. One of the main tasks of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party was to advance the agricultural cooperativization movement to a new stage of development based on the ideological foundation of Comrade Mao Zedong's extremely important report.

Comrade Mao Zedong's report unified the entire Party's thinking on the issue of agricultural cooperativization. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the steps of agricultural cooperativization in our country should be adapted to the steps of socialist industrialization, and that the poor peasants and the less wealthy strata of new and old middle peasants (lower-middle peasants), who account for 60 to 70 percent of the rural population, actively demand to embark on the socialist road. The consistent proposition of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong is: "For the transformation of the individual small-peasant economy and the development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, a positive leadership attitude must be adopted, and a passive laissez-faire attitude must not be adopted." However, some comrades within the Party isolate socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperativization from each other, believing that socialist industrialization can adopt the speed already stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, while agricultural cooperativization should adopt a particularly slow speed. They only see the wavering of a few wealthy peasants on the issue of cooperativization, and do not see the enthusiasm of the vast number of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants in cooperativization. Therefore, as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "They always stand on the position of the bourgeoisie, rich peasants, or wealthy middle peasants with spontaneous capitalist tendencies to plan for a smaller number of people, and do not stand on the position of the working class to plan for the entire country and all the people." Instead of actively, enthusiastically, and systematically leading the cooperativization movement, they always use various methods to pull the movement backward. They look for or even create various excuses to limit the development of the movement, such as saying that agricultural production cooperatives can only develop small, not large; saying that if wealthy middle peasants do not participate, the higher-ups do not send cadres, and there are no agricultural machines, then no cooperatives can be established. They do not see the fact that the development of the movement is basically healthy, and express "infinite worries" about some shortcomings or errors in the work that are not difficult to eliminate, shouting that "the cooperativization movement is advancing rashly," and even saying, "If we do not quickly dismount, there is a risk of destroying the worker-peasant alliance." Therefore, they adopted the practice of disbanding and "resolutely contracting" agricultural production cooperatives that developed rapidly from the winter of 1954 to the spring of 1955, thereby causing great losses to the development of the cooperativization movement. This erroneous practice has a significant and serious divergence from the Party Central Committee's policy. If we implement the Party Central Committee's and Comrade Mao Zedong's policy, our Party will lead China's 500 million peasants onto the socialist road; but if we implement the policies of those comrades, it will in effect be allowing the peasants to move towards the capitalist road, and China's socialist transformation will be impossible to complete.

It should be seen that agricultural cooperativization is not only a fundamental issue for agriculture, but also a fundamental issue for the entire national economy. The backwardness of agricultural development inevitably hinders and has already hindered the development of industry. Conversely, the rapid socialist transformation of agriculture has extremely important significance for the development of production, for the improvement of people's lives, for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and for the elimination of lurking counter-revolutionary remnants in the countryside. Under the conditions that land reform has been completed and new class divisions have occurred in the countryside, only on the basis of cooperativization, that is, socialist transformation, can the national foundation of our country—the worker-peasant alliance—be consolidated. Therefore, the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee on agricultural cooperativization will have great and multifaceted impacts on our country's economic and political life.

Through detailed discussions and profound criticism and self-criticism, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party enabled the leading comrades of provincial, municipal, and regional Party committees across the country to fully recognize the correctness of the Central Committee's policy and filled them with confidence in the great future of agricultural cooperativization. According to the discussions of the representatives of local Party organizations attending the meeting, it is entirely possible for China's 500 million peasants, with the exception of farmers in some border areas, to basically complete cooperativization before 1960, at which time China's agricultural production will have tremendous growth. Based on the experience of agricultural cooperativization movements in various regions, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee made appropriate decisions on many basic policies and working methods of agricultural cooperativization. Perfect implementation of these decisions will ensure that the Party achieves great victories in the high tide of the rural socialist mass movement. However, it must still be seen that in the development of the cooperativization movement, the struggle is complex and the difficulties are numerous, and there must not be any pride, complacency, or rash actions. It is necessary to struggle against class enemies who oppose socialism, to do arduous educational work and meticulous organizational work among the broad masses, to meet both the quantity and quality requirements in development, to exchange experiences and correct mistakes in a timely manner, and to continue to struggle against various erroneous ideas within the Party. Comrade Mao Zedong told us in his report that some people will have to wait and see before they believe that the Party Central Committee's policy is correct, so he said "the work of these two years is very important." We must, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, in the face of a large-scale and profound social reform movement, not only advance with confidence but also work in a down-to-earth manner. Only in this way can we, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and under the policy of "overall planning and strengthening leadership," closely rely on the masses and achieve a complete victory in the agricultural cooperativization movement.

The Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party decided to convene the Eighth National Congress of the Party in the second half of 1956, and decided that the main agenda of this congress would be: (1) the work report of the Central Committee; (2) the report on revising the Party Constitution; (3) instructions on the Second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy; (4) the election of the Party Central Committee.

From now until the convening of the Eighth National Congress, there is still about a year, and 1956 is the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan, which is the most crucial year for the successful completion of the Five-Year Plan. The task of our entire Party is to unite the people of the whole country and continue to work hard on the basis of completing and overfulfilling the 1955 annual plan, strive to better complete and overfulfill the 1956 annual plan, and strive to achieve greater victories on all fronts to welcome the convening of the Eighth National Congress of the Party.

All Party comrades should understand that we are now facing an era of great social change. The construction of socialist industrialization is a great change, agricultural cooperativization and handicraft cooperativization are great changes, and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce is another great change. All comrades of our Party, especially those in charge, must consider how to improve their work in the face of these great changes, and should learn lessons from Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Issue of Agricultural Cooperativization" and the discussions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, and should think about whether their leadership work is keeping up with the needs and not lagging behind the masses, whether they also have right-leaning thoughts, and whether they have implemented the policy of "overall planning and strengthening leadership."

Comrade Mao Zedong told us that the root cause of the error of leadership lagging behind the masses on rural issues is that they fail to grasp the essential aspects and mainstream aspects of the problems, and only see the non-essential aspects and non-mainstream aspects of the problems. Comrade Mao Zedong's report shows us that we must use the Marxist method of class analysis to look at problems, we must always look downward, value the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, we must enthusiastically treat new things, and take protecting and developing new things as the responsibility of leadership. We must seriously learn this method of Comrade Mao Zedong, greatly improve ourselves ideologically and politically, so that we can better fight in all aspects to realize the Party's general line in the transition period.

### 完满地实现党的七届六中全会的决议

    完满地实现党的七届六中全会的决议
    最近举行的党的七届六中全会（扩大）有两个议题，一个是关于农业合作化的问题，一个是关于召开党的第八次全国代表大会的问题。经过会议的讨论，全会一致地通过了“中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议”和“中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）关于召开党的第八次全国代表大会的决议”。
    “关于农业合作化问题的决议”是根据毛泽东同志一九五五年七月三十一日“关于农业合作化问题”的报告通过的决议。毛泽东同志在这个报告中正确地分析了当前国内阶级斗争的形势，尖锐地批评了农村工作中的右倾思想，并对全国农业合作化的规模和步骤作了纲领性的指示和全般性的规划。党的七届六中全会的主要任务之一就是要在毛泽东同志这个极端重要的报告的思想基础上，把农业合作化的运动推进到新的发展阶段。
    毛泽东同志的报告统一了全党关于农业合作化问题的思想。党中央和毛泽东同志指出我国农业合作化的步骤应当和我国的社会主义工业化的步骤相适应，指出占农村人口百分之六十到七十的贫农和新老中农的不富裕的阶层（下中农）积极地要求走上社会主义的道路。党中央和毛泽东同志的一贯主张就是：“对于改造个体的小农经济，发展农业的互助合作，必须采取积极领导的态度，而不能采取消极放任的态度。”但是党内有一部分同志，却把社会主义工业化和农业合作化这两件事互相孤立起来，认为社会主义工业化可以采用五年计划已经规定的速度，而农业合作化则应当采取特别缓慢的速度。他们只看到少数富裕农民在合作化问题上的动摇性，而看不到广大贫农和新、老中农中间的下中农在合作化问题上的积极性，因而正如毛泽东同志所说的：“他们老是站在资产阶级、富农、或者具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农的立场上替较少的人打主意，而没有站在工人阶级的立场上替整个国家和全体人民打主意。”他们不是积极地热情地有计划地去领导合作化运动，而总是用各种办法把这个运动拉向后退。他们寻找以至制造各种借口来限制运动的发展，例如说农业生产合作社只能小发展，不能大发展；说如果富裕中农不参加，上面不派干部去，没有农业机器，就都不能建社。他们看不见运动的发展基本上健康的事实，对工作中的一些不难消除的缺点或错误表示“无穷的忧虑”，叫喊“合作化运动冒进了”，甚至说，“如果不赶快下马，就有破坏工农联盟的危险”。因此，他们对一九五四年冬到一九五五年春迅速发展起来的农业生产合作社，采取了大批解散和“坚决收缩”的做法，从而对合作化运动的发展造成极大的损失。这种错误的做法，同党中央的方针之间存在着显著的严重的分歧。执行党中央和毛泽东同志的方针，我们党就将把我国五万万农民带上社会主义的道路；而如果执行那些同志的方针，在实际上就将是听任农民走向资本主义的道路，而我国的社会主义改造事业就将无法完成。
    应当看到，农业合作化不仅是农业的根本问题，而且是整个国民经济的根本问题。农业发展的落后必然妨碍而且已经妨碍工业的发展。相反，农业的迅速的社会主义化，无论对于生产的发展，对于人民生活的改善，对于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，对于农村中潜伏的反革命残余的肃清，都有极其重大的意义。在土地改革已经完成和农村中已经发生新的阶级分化的条件之下，只有在合作化即社会主义化的基础上，我国的国家基础——工农联盟才能够得到巩固。因此，七届六中全会关于农业合作化的决议，将在我国经济生活和政治生活中产生多方面的伟大影响。
    党的七届六中全会经过详尽的讨论，经过深刻的批评和自我批评，使全国各省市委和各地委的领导同志充分地认识了中央的方针的正确性，并且对农业合作化的伟大前途充满了信心。按照参加会议的各地方党组织代表的讨论，我国的五亿农民，除了一部分边疆地区的农民以外，完全有可能在一九六○年以前基本上完成合作化，那时我国的农业生产将有巨大的增长。根据各地农业合作化运动的经验，七届六中全会对农业合作化的许多基本政策和工作方法都作了妥善的决定。完满地执行这些决定，将使党在农村社会主义群众运动的高潮中有保证取得伟大的胜利。但是仍然必须看到，在合作化运动的发展中，斗争是复杂的，困难是很多的，决不能够有任何的骄傲自满和轻举妄动。必须同反对社会主义的阶级敌人作斗争，必须在广大的群众中做艰苦的教育工作和细致的组织工作，必须在发展中既达到数量的要求，又达到质量的要求，及时地交流经验，改正错误，必须继续同党内的各种错误思想作斗争。毛泽东同志在他的报告中告诉我们，有些人还要看一看，才会相信党中央的方针是正确的，所以他说“这两年的工作很要紧”。我们必须根据毛泽东同志的指示，在巨大规模的深刻的社会改革运动面前，既要满怀信心地前进，更要踏踏实实地工作。只要这样，我们就一定能够在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导下，在“全面规划，加强领导”的方针下，密切地依靠群众，取得农业合作化运动的彻底胜利。
    党的七届六中全会决定在一九五六年下半年召开党的第八次全国代表大会，并决定这次大会的主要议程为：（一）中央委员会的工作报告；（二）关于修改党章的报告；（三）关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的指示；（四）选举党的中央委员会。
    从现在到八次大会的召开，还有一年左右的时间，而一九五六年是五年计划的第四年，这是五年计划能否胜利完成的最关重要的一年。我们全党的任务，就是要在完成和超额完成一九五五年年度计划的基础上，团结全国人民，继续努力，争取更好地完成和超额完成一九五六年的年度计划，争取在各个战线上取得更大的胜利，来迎接党的第八次全国代表大会的召开。
    全党同志应当了解，我们现在正面临着一个伟大的社会变革的时代。社会主义工业化的建设是一个伟大的变革，农业合作化和手工业合作化是一个伟大的变革，资本主义工商业的改造又是一个伟大的变革。我党的全体同志特别是负责同志，在这些伟大变革的面前都必须考虑如何改进自己的工作，都应当从毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会的讨论中得到教训，都应当想一想：自己的领导工作是否赶得上需要而没有落在群众的后面，是否也有右倾思想，是否实行了“全面规划、加强领导”的方针。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们，在农村问题上领导落后于群众的错误在思想方法上的根源就是抓不住问题的本质方面，主流方面，而只看到非本质方面和非主流方面的问题。毛泽东同志的报告使我们看到，必须用马克思主义的阶级分析方法来看问题，必须时时刻刻眼睛向下，重视群众中的积极性和创造性，必须热情地对待新生的事物，把保护和发展新生的事物当作领导的责任。我们必须认真地学习毛泽东同志的这种方法，从思想上政治上把我们自己大大地提高一步，以便我们能够在一切方面更好地为实现党在过渡时期的总路线而斗争。
