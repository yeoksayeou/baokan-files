Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, October 17th: The Burmese Federal Buddhist Delegation returned to Rangoon from China on the 15th with the Buddha Tooth Relic on a special plane. The Chinese Buddha Tooth Relic Escort Delegation also arrived with them.

The President of the Union of Burma, Ba U, and Prime Minister U Nu personally greeted the Buddha Tooth Relic at the airport. A grand welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. Attending the ceremony were the Burmese Minister of Foreign Affairs Sao Khun Hkio, Speaker of the House of Representatives Bo Mu Aung, officials from various ministries, officers from the army, navy, and air force, the Chairman of the Burma Buddhist Association U Tun, as well as senior monks, nuns, and lay Buddhists from Burma, totaling several thousand people.

The Chinese Ambassador to Burma Yao Zhongming and the head of the Chinese Civil Aviation Delegation, General Wu Faxian, also participated in the ceremony.

After the special plane carrying the Buddha Tooth Relic landed, President Ba U was the first to step forward to greet the relic. After the Burmese Federal Buddhist Delegation disembarked, they handed the Buddha Tooth Relic to President Ba U, who then placed it in a specially prepared float.

In his eulogy after welcoming the Buddha Tooth Relic, President Ba U said that for over a thousand years since the Anawrahta Dynasty, Burma had always hoped to receive the Buddha Tooth Relic from China for the people to worship. Now, thanks to the deep friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma, and thanks to the lofty sincerity of Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai towards Burma, Burma was able to receive the Buddha Tooth Relic from China for worship. This is something to be deeply grateful for. President Ba U also said: Worshipping this sacred object will further consolidate the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma, and may the friendship between China and Burma last forever.

The head of the Chinese Buddha Tooth Relic Escort Delegation, Zhao Puchu, said in his speech: The long-cherished wish of Burmese Buddhists to pay homage to the Buddha Tooth Relic has finally been realized today. This is a major event in the history of Sino-Burmese Buddhist relations, and it signifies the further strengthening of Sino-Burmese friendly cooperation. He concluded by wishing Burmese Buddhism prosperity and the people peace and happiness.

After the welcoming ceremony, the float carrying the Buddha Tooth Relic, preceded by a Buddhist ceremonial guard and band, arrived at the Rangoon Peace Pagoda, where the Buddha Tooth Relic was placed in the large stone cave for the people to pay homage. As the Buddha Tooth Relic passed through the main streets of Rangoon, the streets were lined with crowds of Rangoon citizens, welcoming and bowing in reverence, expressing extremely warm emotions.

    新华社十七日讯　仰光消息：缅甸联邦佛教代表团十五日从中国奉迎佛牙乘专机回到仰光。中国佛牙护送团也陪同到达。
    缅甸联邦总统巴宇、总理吴努亲自到机场奉迎佛牙。机场上举行了隆重的奉迎仪式。参加仪式的有缅甸外交部长藻昆卓、国会代表院议长波木昂，各部官员和海陆空军军官，缅甸佛教协会主席吴敦以及缅甸的高僧、尼姑和居士等共数千人。

    运载佛牙的专机着陆后，巴宇总统首先上前奉迎佛牙，缅甸联邦佛教代表团下机后就把佛牙奉交巴宇总统，然后巴宇总统再把佛牙安放在特设的彩车中。
    巴宇总统在奉迎佛牙后致颂词说，缅甸自从阿那律陀皇朝以来的一千余年中，一直希望从中国奉迎佛牙供人民朝拜。现在由于中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦两国之间有了深厚的友谊，由于毛泽东主席和周恩来总理对缅甸的崇高诚意，缅甸才能从中国奉迎佛牙来供奉，这是值得深深感谢的。巴宇总统并且说：朝拜这一圣物，将使中缅两国人民的友谊更进一步巩固，中缅两国友谊万代长存。
    中国佛牙护送团团长赵朴初致词说：缅甸佛教徒很久以来就怀抱着的瞻拜佛牙的愿望，今天终于实现了。这是中缅佛教关系史上一件大事，它标志着中缅友好合作的进一步加强。他最后祝缅甸佛教昌隆，人民安乐。
    奉迎仪式完毕后，安放佛牙的彩车以佛教仪仗队和乐队为前导，到达仰光和平塔，佛牙就被安放在那里的大石窟内，供人民瞻拜。当佛牙经过仰光市的各主要街道时，人山人海的仰光市民，夹道欢迎顶礼，表现了极其热烈的情绪。
