    Promptly Strengthen Market Supply Work During Peak Season
    (Our dispatch) With the widespread bumper harvests of grain, cotton, and other crops this year, the markets in various places are now showing a prosperous scene. State-owned commercial departments in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places have promptly prepared a large number of marketable goods, and are strengthening the supply of goods during the peak season through methods such as organizing visits for promotion, material exchanges, and commodity exhibitions, in order to meet the needs of farmers and urban and mining area residents after the bumper harvest.
    Beijing held a material exchange meeting on October 26. The purpose of this exchange meeting was to adapt to the increase in farmers' purchasing power after the nationwide rural bumper harvest, to promptly organize the supply of urban industrial products and handicrafts to the countryside, and to supply some agricultural and sideline products needed by urban and mining areas. More than 600 representatives from state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives in Beijing and other places participated in this conference. They have formulated purchasing and sales plans based on the characteristics of the peak season market. Forty-six units, including state-owned commercial departments in Beijing, are preparing to supply the countryside with general merchandise, agricultural tools, small hardware, Chinese and Western medicines, and other products with a total value of more than 40 million yuan.
    Since the third quarter, the department stores, chemical industry, and other purchasing and supply stations of state-owned commercial departments in Tianjin have successively dispatched more than 50 visiting promotion groups, carrying a large number of samples, propaganda posters, and product performance descriptions to the vast areas of 15 provinces including Hunan and Shandong to vigorously promote industrial products. By early October, the total value of goods sold by only six purchasing and supply stations such as chemical industry and medicine had reached more than 7.5 million yuan. The state-owned commercial departments in Tianjin also formed two trade delegations, carrying various samples, to participate in material exchange meetings in Baotou, Shijiazhuang, and other places. The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Department Store recently transferred another 180 people to form 38 promotion and visiting groups to promote sales in Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other places.
    The visiting teams and visiting promotion groups organized by relevant departments of state-owned commercial enterprises in Shanghai have gone to rural areas in more than a dozen provinces to conduct visits and promotions. The purchasing and supply stations under the Third Commercial Bureau of Shanghai are coordinating with relevant industrial departments to mobilize factories to tap their potential and increase the output of daily-use industrial products. Eight purchasing and supply stations have decided to expand the processing order plan for the fourth quarter by 4.35 percent and the supply plan by 4.8 percent. In the fourth quarter of this year, the supply of cotton cloth to cotton and grain-rich areas in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Sichuan provinces by Shanghai is sufficient for more than 18 million farmers to add a new piece of clothing each. After the thirteen visiting promotion groups organized by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China National Pharmaceutical Company go to rural areas, they will hold "Exhibitions of Commonly Used Medicines" together with local pharmaceutical companies to expand the supply of medicines.
    More than a dozen wholesale institutions in Chongqing, including state-owned department stores, cotton yarn and cloth companies, hardware and machinery companies, and chemical raw material companies, have also recently dispatched wholesale liaison officers to grassroots sales units in dozens of counties in Sichuan Province to strengthen contact for peak season material supply work. The wholesale liaison officers dispatched by the Chongqing Department Store and its four affiliated wholesale stores helped rural supply and marketing cooperatives in Jiangbei, Nanchuan, and other counties revise their purchase plans based on the needs of farmers. According to the needs of farmers in various places, the Chongqing Wholesale Station of China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company plans to supply more cloth in the fourth quarter, with the cloth produced in Chongqing alone increasing by 50,000 bolts compared with the same quarter last year. According to the contracts signed by various units and transportation departments in Chongqing in October, the volume of goods shipped in and out of Chongqing Port by ships will be equivalent to the annual throughput before liberation.
    State-owned commercial departments in Shandong Province carried out commodity allocation work earlier this year. The materials reserved by state-owned companies in August this year increased by more than 27 percent compared with the same period last year; the inventory of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives also increased by more than 34 percent compared with the same period last year. At present, the wholesale networks throughout the province are expanding, and wholesale institutions have been established in 87 percent of rural grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives.
    The sales promotion team of the Hardware Company of Hohhot City, Inner Mongolia, participated in the primary market material exchange conference with commodities, which was welcomed by the majority of farmers, herdsmen, and grassland cadres. Herdsmen believe that the commodities of state-owned companies and cooperatives are of genuine quality and reasonable price, and hope that the promotion team will often go to the countryside in the future.
    The commercial departments of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region promptly supply various department stores and daily necessities needed by farmers, herdsmen of all ethnic groups, and urban residents for the winter. More than 1,500 tons of materials have been transferred to various places from August to mid-October. It is estimated that the materials transported to parts of Altay Prefecture and Tacheng Prefecture, which have severe climates, before the ice封 by the end of November will be able to supply them until after the thaw next year.
