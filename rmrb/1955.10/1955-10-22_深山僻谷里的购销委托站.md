Purchasing and Sales Commission Stations in Remote Mountain Valleys
　　　　
　　　　Yuan Li

　　　　Rongtang, Rongdi, Heping and other villages in the Sirong District of the Miao Autonomous County of Damiaoshan in Guangxi Province, are located in very remote mountain ridges. The villages are scattered, with one household on the top of a ridge and two or three households on the hillside opposite, within sight of each other. To travel between them, one must cross several high ridges and pass through several mountain valleys. The roads are so narrow that only one foot can be placed on them, and they are covered with slippery moss. It is difficult for peddlers to travel to the villages to do business, and small merchants are unwilling to go there. Miao compatriots who want to buy daily necessities such as oil and salt have to go to Xiangfen Street, forty to fifty li away, which takes a whole day for a round trip.

　　　　Since September of last year, the Sirong District Supply and Marketing Cooperative has established purchasing and sales commission stations in suitable locations in these villages, delivering goods such as oil, salt, fermented soybeans, general merchandise, and small farm tools to the deep mountains. At the same time, it purchases local specialties, thus changing the situation in these villages where “it is difficult to buy goods even with money, and it is impossible to sell goods even if they have wings.” The farthest distance to buy and sell goods at the station is only seven or eight li.

　　　　On the day the Heping Village commission station was established, an eighty-year-old man exclaimed with joy: “Delivery to the door is a first since the beginning of time!” In the long life experience of this old man, he may have been to Changan Town, a hundred li away. Merchants took advantage of the fact that he came from the deep mountains, exchanging a needle for an egg or a jin of salt for a jin of fragrant mushrooms. Now, before his eyes, one egg can be exchanged for twenty needles, and one jin of fragrant mushrooms can be exchanged for four jin of salt, with delivery to his doorstep. How could this change not make the old man shout with excitement?

　　　　Every day at eight or nine o'clock in the morning, or at six o'clock in the afternoon when people are resting from work and returning from the mountains to eat, the commission station begins to get busy. Men, women, old and young come and go, making people forget that this is a remote mountain valley forty to fifty li away from the market. The middle-aged people in charge of the household take three or four jin of palm bark or a jin or so of fragrant mushrooms and wood ear to the purchasing and sales commission station to exchange for oil, salt, fermented soybeans, etc.; the young girls take bundles of light bamboo leaves picked while watching cattle to sell to the commission station, and then carefully select their favorite colored velvet threads or a floral handkerchief; children who have never been to the street can also taste the candies they love to eat. Seafood such as salted fish, kelp, and squid, which are considered treasures in the mountainous areas, are also available. The younger generation who eat these foods no longer worry about developing unsightly "goiter" (a thyroid enlargement disease suffered by people in mountainous areas due to lack of iodine nutrition). Whenever someone suffers from heatstroke or malaria, they can immediately buy Liushen Water, Ten Drops Water, Yixinyou, quinine and other medicines at the commission station.

　　　　The masses have unparalleled love for the commission station. When these commission stations were first established, the masses automatically vacated their houses and took out their own fir trees to repair the houses. Some people volunteered to carry goods into the mountains (still paid). The youth militia taking turns guarding the cargo room every night has become a system. Once, thirty-one jin of brown sugar at the Rongdi Village commission station melted. The masses were distressed to see it, so they automatically took it to process it into sugar cubes and took it to the "Fair" (festival event), where it was sold out in one day, so that their property was not lost.

    深山僻谷里的购销委托站
    远漓
    广西省大苗山苗族自治县四荣区的荣塘、荣地、和平等乡，座落在很偏僻的山岭间，村寨分散，这一户在岭顶上，那两三户在对面岭腰间，咫尺可见。如果来往，就要翻过几个高岭，穿过几个山坳，路窄小得只能踩上一只脚，还长满了滑滑的青苔。靠货郎担来游村做买卖也很困难，小商贩也不愿进去。苗族同胞们要买油、盐等日用品，必须到四五十里外的香粉街上去，来回要花一天时间。
    从去年九月起，四荣区供销社在这几个乡选择适中地点，成立了购销委托站，把油、盐、豆豉、百货、小农具等物品，送到深山里去，同时收购当地的土特产品，从此改变了这些乡“任凭有钱难买货，有货插翅也难飞”的情况。最远的来站买卖东西也只有七、八里路。
    和平乡委托站成立那天，有一位八十多岁的老人高兴得情不自禁地喊起来：“送货上门到这里，是开天辟地第一次哟！”在这位老人漫长的生活经历里，也许到过一百里路外的长安镇，商人欺侮他是深山里来的，拿一根针换他一个鸡蛋，一斤盐换一斤香菌。现今，在他眼前的是一个鸡蛋能换到二十根针，一斤香菌换到四斤盐，还是送货到家门口。这个变化，怎么不叫这位老人激动地欢呼呢？
    每天上午八、九点钟，或者下午六点钟人们歇工从山上回来用饭的时候，委托站就开始忙碌起来。男女老少来来往往，使人忘记了这里是远离墟街四、五十里路的深山僻谷。当家的中年人拿三、四斤棕皮，或斤把香菌、木耳，到购销委托站去换油、盐、豆豉等等；年轻的姑娘们拿着一捆捆看牛时摘到的淡竹叶，卖给委托站，然后再细心选购她们中意的各色丝绒线，或则是一条花手巾；从未上过街的娃子们，也可以尝到他们爱吃的糖果。在山区被视为珍品的咸鱼、海带、鱿鱼之类的海味，也有供应。年轻的一代吃到这些食品，再不耽心自己会长起难看的“泡颈”（山区群众缺乏碘质营养所患的甲状腺肿大的病）。每当有人发痧、发疟病的时候，到委托站可以马上买到六神水、十滴水、一心油、奎寗等药品。
    群众对委托站热爱无比。这几个委托站刚成立的时候，群众都自动腾房子，拿出自己的杉木修理房屋，有的人义务劳动把货物挑进山来（还是给工资）。青年民兵每夜轮班保护货房已成为一种制度。有一次，荣地乡委托站的三十一斤黄糖溶化了，群众看到很心痛，就自动拿来加工做糖块，再拿到“会期”（节日盛会）上，一天工夫就销完了，使自己的财产没有受到损失。
