Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, October 5th: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army wrote a letter on the 3rd to the Chairman of the International Commission for Cambodia, explaining the position of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards the Kingdom of Cambodia. This letter is to be forwarded by the International Commission for Vietnam.

    The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army stated that it has no objections to the exchange of letters between the Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the International Commission for Cambodia regarding the recent events in O'Yadaw, as they mention matters unrelated to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which are entirely internal affairs of Cambodia. The letter from the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army pointed out that the recent rumors spread by the United States, falsely accusing the Vietnam People's Army of invading Cambodian territory in O'Yadaw, are completely unbelievable and will not cause misunderstandings between the Cambodian and Vietnamese peoples. This is an American conspiracy to sow hatred between the Cambodian and Vietnamese peoples, attempting to undermine peace in Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world.

    The letter pointed out that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that there is a good foundation for the Kingdom of Cambodia and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to establish good-neighborly relations based on the wishes of the Cambodian and Vietnamese peoples. At the Fifth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong stated that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to establish friendly relations with Cambodia based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    The letter stated that, according to the instructions of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army believes it is necessary to state that the Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam hope to realize the policy of friendship and good neighborliness at an early date through concrete actions. Therefore, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam welcomes the statement made by Prince Sihanouk on September 13th at a press conference regarding the preparation to exchange political representatives with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and is prepared to directly negotiate with the Cambodian government to enhance mutual trust and understanding.

    The letter also stated that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requests the International Commission for Cambodia to convey the above opinions to the Cambodian government.

    越南人民军总部写信给柬埔寨国际委员会
    说明越南民主共和国对柬埔寨王国的立场
    新华社河内五日电越南人民军总司令部三日写信给柬埔寨国际委员会主席说明越南民主共和国对柬埔寨王国的立场。这封信是请越南国际委员会转交的。
    越南人民军总司令部表示它对于柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨国际委员会就最近在云晒发生的事件交换的信件并没有意见，因为其中提到一些同越南民主共和国政府无关的事情，这完全属于柬埔寨内政问题。越南人民军总司令部的信中指出，最近美国诬蔑越南人民军侵入柬埔寨领土云晒的谣言根本不能使人相信，也不会引起柬埔寨和越南两个民族间的误解。这是美国阴谋挑拨柬埔寨和越南两个民族间的仇恨，企图破坏印度支那、东南亚和世界的和平。
    信中指出，越南民主共和国政府认为，柬埔寨王国和越南民主共和国根据柬埔寨和越南两个民族的愿望来建立两国之间的睦邻关系有着良好的基础。在越南民主共和国国民大会第五次会议上，范文同总理曾经说明越南民主共和国愿意根据和平共处的五项原则同柬埔寨建立友好关系。
    信中说，根据越南民主共和国政府的指示，越南人民军总司令部认为有必要说明，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府希望能够用切实的行动来早日实现友好睦邻的政策。所以，对于西哈努克亲王九月十三日在记者招待会上关于准备和越南民主共和国政府交换政治代表的声明，越南民主共和国政府表示欢迎，并且准备和柬埔寨政府直接商谈，以增进相互间的信任和了解。
    信中还说，越南民主共和国政府请柬埔寨国际委员会把上述意见转达给柬埔寨政府。
