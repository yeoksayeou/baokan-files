After Seeing the Workers' Sports Exhibition
Feng Zhong

The Workers' Sports Exhibition officially opened on October 2nd at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. This is the largest sports exhibition in our country since the founding of the People's Republic. In addition to introducing workers' sports, the exhibition also introduced the new face of sports in our country; introduced sports in the Soviet Union and friendly visits and competitions between our country and the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, as well as the participation of our athletes in international competitions and exhibited some of the gifts exchanged. The exhibition also used models, pictures, and charts to illustrate the relationship between sports and health, introduced the exercise value of various sports, and scientific knowledge of sports medicine and physiological hygiene. The exhibition also displayed more than 700 physical objects, including models of various sports equipment and various sports equipment and books. The precious gifts presented by the Soviet Trade Union Sports Delegation to the First National Workers' Sports Games, the electric glass human body model presented to China by the German Democratic Republic, and the glider presented to Comrade Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense, by the Polish People's Republic were also on display at the exhibition.

The exhibition focuses on the increasingly developing workers' sports in our country.

In recent years, with the restoration and development of the national economy, and the continuous improvement of the material and cultural life of workers, workers' sports in various factories and mines have been widely carried out, and have achieved remarkable results in enhancing workers' physical fitness, reducing diseases, ensuring attendance, and improving labor productivity. The development of workers' sports is inseparable from the attention and care of the Party and the government. Upon entering the entrance of the exhibition hall, the first thing that catches the eye is the excerpt in gold letters on a red background from the Party Central Committee’s instructions on carrying out people’s sports work: “Improving the people’s health and enhancing the people’s physical fitness is an important political task of the Party. Especially now that the country has entered a new historical period of planned economic construction, the people are even more in need of healthy bodies, but the people’s health is still far from meeting the needs of various tasks. In order to change this situation, in addition to strengthening health work and gradually improving labor, learning, and other conditions, carrying out sports is indeed the most active and effective method. Not only that, but sports are also an important means of cultivating the people’s courage, perseverance, collectivist spirit, and carrying out communist education for the working people. At a time when our country is striving to realize the general line and general tasks of the transition period, strengthening sports work is of even greater significance.” This instruction from the Party Central Committee shows that the Party is very concerned about the people's health, and at the same time clearly tells us the important significance of carrying out sports activities.

Establishing sports associations is a basic link in developing and consolidating workers' sports. The Sports Commission and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions have decided to gradually establish sports associations in industrial systems and grassroots factories and mines where conditions permit starting in 1955. At present, there are eight national industrial sports associations (two of which are in the preparatory stage), including the China Railway Sports Association. The exhibition uses pictures and charts to introduce the earliest established China Railway Sports Association. The China Railway Sports Association is an amateur sports organization for railway workers established in Beijing in June 1952. According to statistics in 1954, there were 1,429 railway sports associations at all levels across the country. From 1951 to 1955, nine national railway games were held. Grassroots sports associations also continuously held sports meets. In 1954 alone, 1,980 sports meets were held, with more than 245,600 athletes participating. From the pictures on display, you can see the diverse sports activities of railway workers, such as radio calisthenics, ball games, skating, swimming, tug-of-war, rope skipping, horizontal and parallel bars, track and field, and shooting. The exhibition also introduces the activities of several grassroots sports associations.

In the past six years, trade union organizations in various places have trained a large number of sports cadres and activists, who are the backbone of carrying out workers' sports activities. The charts exhibited show that, according to incomplete statistics from eight cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Shenyang, Harbin, and Fushun, from 1951 to 1954, a total of 53 training courses for workers' sports cadres and activists were held, with 18,847 people participating in amateur learning. This number has been increasing year by year. For example, in 1951, only three training courses were held, with only 462 people participating in learning; in 1954, 29 training courses were held, with 13,937 people participating in learning. From the pictures on display, the content of the training includes not only track and field, gymnastics, and ball games, but also swimming, motorcycles, parachuting, and sampans. The workers' sampan training class held by the Qingdao Sailing Club has trained more than 500 workers from May this year to now.

With the development of workers' sports, the sports equipment and venues of various factories and mines are also gradually increasing. According to the materials exhibited, as of August this year, incomplete statistics from five cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, and Fushun, and the Railway Sports Association, there are a total of 240 football fields, 2,695 basketball courts, 1,032 volleyball courts, 55 skating rinks, 10 swimming pools, 152 track and field fields, and 4,199 pieces of various exercise equipment. Many of these sports fields were opened up by workers in their spare time. The exhibition showcases pictures and models of workers from factories such as Zhejiang Linen Factory and Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory opening up venues in their spare time.

The exhibition introduces various types of worker sports activities in relatively detailed manner. There are radio calisthenics, exercise groups, labor defense system preliminary grade exercises, various ball games, apparatus exercises, swimming, skating, water sports, and various national defense sports activities.

Radio calisthenics are becoming more and more popular among workers. According to incomplete statistics from five cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Harbin, Fushun, and Shenyang, and the Railway Sports Association, the number of workers participating in radio calisthenics in 1954 increased five times compared with 1952. In the Anshan Iron and Steel Electrical Repair Factory, radio calisthenics have become an indispensable part of the workers' lives, and the number of people doing exercises every day reaches more than 95% of the total number of workers in the factory, and has never been interrupted even in the severe winter.

Various ball games are the most popular sports items for workers. According to the charts exhibited, statistics from three cities, 26 provinces, and the Railway Sports Association in 1954, there are 57,414 workers' basketball teams with more than 566,000 players; 21,166 volleyball teams with more than 200,000 players; 4,145 soccer teams with more than 72,300 players. The exhibition introduces two outstanding workers' soccer teams – the Dalian Shipbuilding Company soccer team and the Wuhan "Food Industry" soccer team. The 20 players of the Wuhan "Food Industry" soccer team are all workers from the slaughtering workshop and breeding workshop of the Wuhan Frozen Meat Processing Plant. This year, it represented Wuhan in the national soccer championship in major and medium-sized cities, and successively defeated the representative teams of Chengdu, Chongqing, Changsha, and Zhengzhou. The players also have excellent achievements in production. Six of the players were rated as second-class and third-class merit recipients in production in 1954. In last year's flood control struggle, seven people were included in the list of merit recipients. The entire slaughtering workshop was also rated as an advanced production unit in the factory, and the red flag of excellent production, like the sports trophy, is often hung next to their workbenches.

The exhibition also introduces the development of sports activities in several grassroots units. The sports activities of the Jinzhou Textile Factory in Dalian, which has more than 7,000 workers, have gradually become popular and regular, and workers have a certain amount of time to participate in sports training in various projects. The factory has also created many lively sports games based on workers' living habits and different physiques. There are three radio calisthenics sessions every day, and workers in all three shifts have the opportunity to participate. The factory's sports organization also organizes summer camps, seaside recreational gatherings, night marches, mountain climbing, picnics and other activities according to different seasons. The factory regularly holds worker sports meets in the spring and autumn every year, with the participation of 85% of the total number of workers in the factory. Due to the extensive development of mass sports activities, the health of workers has been ensured and the cultural life of workers has been enlivened. The attendance rate of all workers in the factory reaches more than 95%, and the state's production tasks are completed on time or ahead of schedule. The Shenyang Screw Factory established a sports association and carried out various sports activities. After that, the physical fitness of workers was enhanced, and the morbidity rate decreased from 100 in January this year to 65 in May. The Beijing Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has persisted in holding Sunday ball games from 1952 to the present, with 10 to 15 soccer and basketball games every Sunday.

In order to promote the development of mass sports and continuously improve the level of sports technology, track and field and ball games have been held many times in various places. According to incomplete statistics from five cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Harbin, Fushun, and Taiyuan, and the Railway Sports Association, from 1951 to August 1955, a total of 6,881 sports meets of various types were held, with more than 940,000 athletes participating. The exhibition displays beautiful colorful pictures of worker sports meets in many cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and the sports meets recently held by various industrial units across the country.

The First National Workers' Sports Games has already opened. Through this conference, the sports movement of workers in our country will have further development.

    看了工人体育运动展览会以后
    冯众
    工人体育运动展览会十月二日在北京市劳动人民文化宫正式开幕。这是我国建国以来规模最大的一次体育运动展览会。展览会除介绍了工人体育运动以外，还介绍了我国体育运动的新面貌；介绍了苏联的体育运动和我国同苏联、各人民民主国家先后互派体育代表团进行友谊访问比赛等活动，以及我国运动员参加国际比赛的情况并展览了一部分互赠礼物。展览会还通过模型、图片、图表，说明了体育运动和健康的关系，介绍了各项体育运动的锻炼价值，体育医疗、生理卫生等科学知识。展览会还展出了体育运动的各种设备的模型和各种体育器械、书籍等七百多件实物。苏联工会体育代表团赠给我全国第一届工人体育运动大会的珍贵礼物，德意志民主共和国赠给我国的电动玻璃人体模型和波兰人民共和国赠给我国防部彭德怀部长的滑翔机也都在展览会里展出。
    展览会着重介绍了日益发展中的我国职工体育运动。
    几年来，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，以及职工物质生活和文化生活的不断改善，各厂矿职工体育运动有了广泛的开展，对于增强职工体质，减少疾病，保证出勤率，提高劳动生产率等方面都收到了显著的效果。职工体育运动的开展，是同党、政府的重视和关怀分不开的。一进展览大厅的门口，首先触目的是红底金字的摘录党中央关于开展人民体育运动工作的指示：“改善人民的健康状况，增强人民体质，是党的一项重要政治任务。特别是当前国家已进入有计划的经济建设的新的历史时期，更需要人民有健康的身体，但现在人民健康状况还远不能适应各项工作的需要。为了改变这种情况，除了加强卫生工作和逐步改善劳动、学习等条件外，开展体育运动确是一种最积极的有效的方法。不仅如此，体育运动并且是培养人民勇敢、坚毅、集体主义精神和向劳动人民进行共产主义教育的重要手段之一。当着我们国家正在为实现过渡时期总路线、总任务而奋斗的时期，加强体育工作就有更大的意义。”党中央的这个指示说明了党是非常关怀人民身体健康的，同时也明确地告诉我们开展体育活动的重要意义。
    建立体育协会是发展和巩固职工体育运动的基本环节。体育运动委员会和中华全国总工会决定从一九五五年起逐步在有条件的产业系统和基层厂矿建立体育协会。目前全国已有中国火车头体育协会等八个全国产业体育协会（其中两个在筹备阶段）。展览会用图片、图表介绍了建立最早的中国火车头体育协会。中国火车头体育协会是一九五二年六月在北京成立的铁路职工的业余体育团体。据一九五四年统计，全国已有各级火车头体育协会一千四百二十九个。从一九五一年到一九五五年举行了九次全国铁路运动会。各基层体育协会也不断举行运动会，仅一九五四年一年，就举行了一千九百八十次运动会，有运动员二十四万五千六百多人参加。从展出的图片中可以看到铁路职工多种多样的体育活动，如广播体操、球类、滑冰、游泳、拔河、跳绳、单双杠、田径、射击等。展览会还介绍了几个基层体育协会的活动。
    六年来，各地工会组织培养和训练了大批体育干部和积极分子，他们是开展职工体育活动的骨干。展览会展出的图表说明：据北京、上海、天津、广州、武汉、沈阳、哈尔滨、抚顺等八个市的不完全统计，从一九五一年到一九五四年，共举办了职工体育干部和积极分子训练班五十三次，业余参加学习的有一万八千八百四十七人。这个数字是逐年增加的。如一九五一年举办的训练班只有三次，参加学习的只有四百六十二人；一九五四年就举办了二十九次，参加学习的有一万三千九百三十七人。从展出的图片中看，训练的内容，不但有田径、体操、球类等项目，而且有游泳、摩托车、跳伞、舢板等。青岛航海俱乐部举办的工人舢板训练班从今年五月到现在已训练了五百多名工人。
    随着职工体育运动的开展，各厂矿的体育设备、场地也在逐步增多，据展出的材料，截至今年八月，北京、上海、沈阳、哈尔滨、抚顺五个市和火车头体育协会的不完全统计，共有足球场二百四十个，篮球场二千六百九十五个，排球场一千零三十二个，滑冰场五十五个，游泳池十个，田径场一百五十二个和各种器械操设备四千一百九十九件。其中许多运动场是职工利用业余时间自行开辟的。展览会展出了浙江麻纺厂、唐山华新纺织厂等厂职工利用业余时间开辟场地的图片和模型。
    展览会比较详细地介绍了多种多样的工人体育活动。有广播体操、锻炼小组、劳卫制预备级锻炼，有各种球类、器械操、游泳、滑冰、水上运动，以及各种国防体育活动。
    广播体操在职工群众中一天比一天普及起来了，据北京、上海、哈尔滨、抚顺、沈阳五个市和火车头体育协会的不完全统计，参加广播体操的职工一九五四年就比一九五二年增加五倍。在鞍钢电修厂，广播体操已成为职工生活中不可缺少的一部分，每天作操的人数达到全厂总人数的百分之九十五以上，在严冬也没有间断过。
    各种球类是职工最喜欢的运动项目。根据展出的图表，三个市二十六个省和火车头体育协会的一九五四年统计，职工篮球队有五万七千四百十四个队，队员有五十六万六千多人；排球队有二万一千一百六十六个队，队员有二十万多人；足球队有四千一百四十五个队，队员有七万二千三百多人。展览会介绍了两支出色的工人足球队——大连造船公司足球队和武汉市“食工”足球队。武汉“食工”足球队的二十个队员都是武汉冻肉加工厂宰牲车间和饲养车间的工人。今年它代表武汉市参加全国大中城市分区足球锦标赛，先后战胜了成都、重庆、长沙、郑州等市的代表队。队员在生产上也有很好的成绩，队员中有六个人在一九五四年被评为生产上的二等功臣和三等功臣，在去年防汛斗争中，有七个人被列入功臣榜。整个宰牲车间也被评为全厂一等先进生产单位，生产优秀红旗像运动锦标一样常常挂在他们的工作台旁。
    展览会还介绍了几个基层单位体育活动开展的情况。有七千多职工的旅大金州纺织厂的体育活动已逐步走向普及和经常化，职工有一定时间参加各种项目的体育锻炼。厂里还根据工人生活习惯和不同的体质，创造了许多生动活泼的体育游戏。每天有三次广播体操，三班生产工人都有机会参加。工厂的体育组织还根据不同季节举办夏令营、海滨游艺大会、夜行军、登山、野游等活动，每年春秋两季照例举行职工体育大会，参加大会的职工达全厂职工数的百分之八十五。由于群众体育活动的广泛开展，保证了职工身体健康，活跃了职工文化生活。全厂职工出勤率达百分之九十五以上，并按期或超额完成国家的生产任务。沈阳螺钉厂成立了体育协会，开展了各种体育活动以后，职工体质增强了，生病率以今年一月为一百，五月就降低到六十五。北京长辛店机车车辆修理工厂从一九五二年到现在一直坚持举办星期球赛，每个星期天都有十场到十五场的足、篮球比赛。
    为了推动群众性体育运动的开展和不断提高运动技术水平，各地都举行多次职工田径、球类的运动会。据北京、上海、哈尔滨、抚顺、太原五个市及火车头体育协会的不完全统计，从一九五一年到一九五五年八月，共举办了各种运动会六千八百八十一次，有运动员九十四万多人参加。展览会展出了北京、天津、沈阳、上海、广州等许多城市职工运动会和最近全国各产业单位举行运动会的美丽的五彩图片。
    第一届全国工人体育运动大会已经开幕了，通过这次大会，我国职工的体育运动将有进一步的发展。
