Based on the results of the exchange of views, the two sides reached a consensus on the following issues:
“1. China and Japan should actively strive to realize the normalization of diplomatic relations.
2. In terms of trade relations, due to the regulations of the Paris Coordinating Committee, the number of embargoed goods from Japan to China is increasing. This situation must be changed, and efforts must be made to abolish it quickly.
3. The commodity exhibitions held in the capitals of China and Japan should be established as permanent institutions to handle liaison affairs related to trade between the two sides. The two countries should provide necessary protection to the personnel dispatched by both sides.
4. Cultural exchanges between the two countries are helpful to promoting peace and friendship between China and Japan. In the future, the two countries should strive to enhance them further.
5. China and Japan should actively take care of the expatriates of both sides so that they can freely travel to and from their home countries.
6. China and Japan have previously returned the remains of deceased persons to each other. In the future, both sides should continue to return the remains of deceased persons to their home countries as soon as possible.
7. The Chinese side stated that the handling of war criminals is a matter of Chinese sovereignty and that the results of the handling of war criminals will be announced in the near future.”

The Chinese and Japanese sides affirmed the above-mentioned consensus and agreed to issue a communiqué and are willing to make the greatest efforts for this purpose.

    根据交换意见的结果，双方就下列各项问题，取得了一致的意见：“一、中日两国应该为实现邦交的正常化积极努力。
    二、在贸易关系上，由于巴黎统筹委员会的规定，日本对中国的禁运物品越来越多，这种情况必须予以变更，并且必须以迅速废除它为目标而努力。
    三、把在中日两国首都举行的商品展览会作为常设的机构，以处理有关双方贸易的联络事务，两国应对双方所派遣的人员等互相予以应有的保护等。

    五、中日两国应该积极地照顾双方侨民，使他们能够自由地来往本国。
