The United States' rude interference in Egypt's purchase of weapons from Czechoslovakia has been met with indignant condemnation by Egyptian and many Arab countries' public opinion, and has aroused dissatisfaction among public opinion in various countries. US Assistant Secretary of State Allen, who was sent to Cairo to put pressure on the Egyptian government, also "apparently failed." However, US officials have made unwarranted complaints to the Soviet Union on this issue. In a statement at a press conference on October 4, US Secretary of State Dulles said: "From the perspective of US-Soviet relations, this delivery of arms will not help ease tensions." Dulles's forced connection of matters unrelated to the Soviet Union to the Soviet Union is clearly motivated by ulterior motives.

Egypt and Czechoslovakia's independent and autonomous trade is their own business. The Soviet government stated its position on this issue in a TASS statement issued on October 1. The statement said: "The Soviet government believes that every country has the legitimate right to be concerned about its own national defense and to purchase the weapons it needs for its national defense from other countries under normal commercial conditions. No foreign country has the right to interfere, nor does it have the right to make any one-sided demands that infringe on the rights or interests of other countries." It is clear from this that the Soviet Union respects the legitimate rights of Egypt and Czechoslovakia and opposes other countries interfering in the legitimate trade between Egypt and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union's position is entirely in line with its consistent adherence to the principles of equality and non-interference in internal affairs in international relations, which are necessary conditions for maintaining and strengthening friendly cooperation between countries and easing international tensions. Now, it is the United States, not others, that is interfering in the legitimate rights of Egypt and Czechoslovakia, and is even attempting to extend its pressure tactics to the Soviet Union. This attitude is indeed harmful to the efforts of all countries to ease international tensions.

People know that since the Geneva Four-Power Summit, leaders of the US government have continuously talked about a "new friendly attitude" in international relations, especially between the US and the Soviet Union. When US President Eisenhower spoke about developing friendly relations between the people of the US and the Soviet Union at the Geneva Conference, he specifically emphasized that "this can only be done in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust." But how can people believe that Dulles's forced connection of the issue of legitimate trade between Egypt and Czechoslovakia, which has nothing to do with either the US or the Soviet Union, to US-Soviet relations is a "new friendly attitude"? Needless to say, this does not at all demonstrate the spirit of "mutual respect and trust" emphasized by Eisenhower. It is not intended to enhance understanding and cooperation between the two countries, but to stir up blinding dust in the relations between the two countries, in order to create a tense atmosphere.

Dulles not only deliberately fabricates unwarranted incidents in US-Soviet relations, but also continues to threaten Egypt. In his remarks at the press conference, he said: "The policy of the United States has generally been to avoid participating in things that might turn into an arms race; we still hope that it will be possible to avoid falling into that situation." This is still trying to force Egypt to obey the United States and stop implementing its legitimate trade with Czechoslovakia. Otherwise, the United States will launch an arms race against Egypt. Does Dulles still believe that they can use threats and pressure to achieve their goal of controlling the fate of Middle Eastern countries? Isn't this very outdated?

The United States' so-called "avoiding an arms race" and maintaining the "balance of power" in the Middle East are just empty words that have long been seen through by people of insight. In a speech on October 2, Prime Minister Nasser clearly pointed out that these empty words are a "great deception to confuse world public opinion." He also said that the purpose of this deception "is to attempt to better control us." The so-called "balance of power" proposition is simply a disregard for the independent sovereignty of other countries and a cover for forcibly dividing other countries into their own "spheres of influence." It is something that completely arises from the demands of imperialism. Today, it can no longer have any room for existence.

Both Egypt and Czechoslovakia have stated that they will abide by the recently signed barter agreement, and their firm stand in safeguarding their sovereignty has been met with sympathy and support from the Chinese people and the people of many countries. This support arises from the common interests and common aspirations of the Asian and African people and is completely reliable.

    何故硬扯苏联
    高集  
    美国对埃及购买捷克斯洛伐克武器所采取的粗暴干涉态度，遭到了埃及和许多阿拉伯国家舆论的愤慨斥责，并且引起了各国公众舆论的不满。被派往开罗对埃及政府施加压力的美国助理国务卿艾伦，也“显然失败”了。但是，美国官方却在这个问题上向苏联提出了毫无理由的抱怨。美国国务卿杜勒斯在十月四日记者招待会上发表的谈话中就说：“从美国同苏联关系的观点来看，这种运交军火的事是不会有助于缓和紧张局势的。”杜勒斯把同苏联毫无关系的事情硬扯到苏联的头上，这显然是别有居心的。
    埃及和捷克斯洛伐克进行独立自主的贸易，这是它们两国自己的事情。苏联政府在十月一日塔斯社发表的声明中表明了它对这个问题的态度。这个声明说：“苏联政府方面认为：每一个国家有关心自己国防和按照通常的商业条件向其他国家购买自己的国防所需要的武器的合法权利，任何一个外国都没有权利加以干涉，也没有权利提出侵犯其他国家的权利或利益的任何片面要求。”由此可见，苏联尊重埃捷两国的合法权利，并且反对其他国家干涉埃捷两国的正当贸易。苏联的这种立场是完全符合于它在国际关系中一贯坚持的平等和互不干涉内政的原则的，而这种原则是维持和加强国与国间友好合作和缓和国际紧张局势的必要条件。现在，不是别人，正是美国对于埃捷两国的合法权利横加干涉，并且还企图把它的压力手段扩大到苏联的头上。这种态度倒真是对于各国缓和国际紧张局势的努力有害的。
    人们知道，自从日内瓦四国政府首脑会议以来，美国政府的领袖们曾不断谈论国际关系中，特别是苏美两国之间的“新的友好态度”。美国总统艾森豪威尔在日内瓦会议上谈到发展苏美两国人民友好关系的时候，并曾特别强调指出：“只有在互相尊重和信任的气氛中才能够做到这一点”。但是，人们怎能认为杜勒斯硬把既与美国、也和苏联毫无关系的埃捷两国进行正当贸易的问题扯到苏美关系上来，是一种“新的友好的态度”呢？不用说，这完全没有表现出艾森豪威尔所强调的“互相尊重和信任”的精神，它不是为了增强两国间的谅解和合作，而是为了在两国关系中扬起迷人眼睛的沙土，借以制造紧张气氛。
    杜勒斯不仅在苏美关系上故意制造莫须有的事件，而且还继续对埃及加以威胁。他在记者招待会的谈话中说：“美国的政策大体上一直是要避免参加可能会变成军备竞赛的事情；我们仍旧希望有可能避免陷入那种境地。”这就还是想要埃及听命于美国，停止实施它和捷克斯洛伐克的正当贸易，否则，美国就要对埃及发动军备竞赛了。杜勒斯到现在还以为能够用威胁和压力的手段来达到他们控制中东国家的命运的目的。这岂不是十分不合时宜吗？
    美国所谓要“避免军备竞赛”和维持中东和平的“势力均衡”的这类鬼话，早已为有识之士看穿了。纳赛尔总理在十月二日发表的演说中，就明白地指出，这类鬼话是一个“迷惑世界舆论的大骗局”。他并且说，这种骗局的目的“是企图更好地控制我们”。所谓“势力均衡”的主张根本就是蔑视他国独立主权，把他国强派为自己的“势力范围”的掩盖词。它完全是从帝国主义的要求产生的东西。在今天，它不能再有存在的余地。
    埃及和捷克斯洛伐克双方都已表示它们将遵守最近签订的换货协定，它们坚决维护自己主权的这种立场，得到了中国人民和许多国家的人民的同情和支持。这种支持是从亚非人民的共同利益和共同愿望产生的，是完全可靠的。
