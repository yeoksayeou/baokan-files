    Electromechanical Installation Project at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant Proceeds Intensively
    The electromechanical equipment installation project inside the workshops of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, as well as the cable and pipeline laying project inside and outside the plant area, are proceeding simultaneously with intense construction.
    By the end of September, factory cables had been extended into the interior of four workshops, and the wires extending from the main cable lines of the factory area to each workshop had been connected to each installed machine. Proceeding with the same intensity as the cable project are the equipment installation for the gas station, compressed air station, and thermal power station, as well as the overhead erection of gas pipelines throughout the plant and the welding of steam pipelines in the plant area for power engineering. At present, the main body of the first gas generator has been basically installed and will soon be able to send gas. The first phase of the steam pipeline project, which is needed first, is also about to be completed.
    The electromechanical installation projects in various machining workshops, blank preparation workshops, and auxiliary production workshops are also proceeding intensely. Heavy and precision equipment is now being installed in the casting, forging, and other production preparation workshops, as well as in the body pressing and engine processing workshops, which started construction successively in the second half of this year.
    Since July of last year, the mechanical equipment of the various auxiliary production workshops, chassis, metal products, accessories, woodworking, and other basic workshops of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the thermal power station has been basically installed. A large amount of equipment in these workshops has already been put into trial production and adjustment production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    第一汽车制造厂机电安装工程紧张进行
    第一汽车制造厂厂房内部的机电设备安装工程和厂区内外的电缆、管道敷设工程正同时进行紧张的施工。
    九月底，厂区电缆已经伸到四个厂房内部，由厂区电缆干线伸向各个厂房的电线，已经同安装好的每部机器连接起来。和电缆工程同样紧张施工的还有煤气站、压缩空气站和热电站等的设备安装，以及全厂煤气管道的凌空架设和厂区蒸汽管道焊接等动力工程。目前，第一台煤气发生炉的本体已基本安装完成，不久可发送煤气。最先需用的第一期蒸汽管道工程也就要完成。
    各机械加工车间、毛坯准备车间和辅助生产车间的机电安装工程也在紧张进行。在今年下半年陆续动工的铸工、锻工等生产准备车间，车身压制、发动机等加工车间，现正开始安装重型的和精密的设备。
    自去年七月份以来，第一汽车制造厂各辅助生产车间，底盘、金属品、附件、木工等基本车间和热电站的机械设备已基本安装完成。这些车间有大量设备已进行试生产和调整生产。（新华社）
