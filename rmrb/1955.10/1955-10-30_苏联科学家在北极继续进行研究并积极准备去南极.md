Xinhua News Agency, October 29th—TASS reports: Currently, the Soviet "North Pole-5" drifting scientific station is shrouded in the gloomy weather of the Arctic night. The temperature there is often between minus 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, with snow and wind speeds often reaching 20 meters per second. The ice floe where the scientific station is located has increased its westward drift speed and crossed the Lomonosov underwater ridge. The staff of the scientific station are continuing to carry out normal scientific research activities with the help of new electric heating equipment, lighting equipment, new ventilation and radio equipment, and some observations have even been expanded.

Not long ago, the staff of the "North Pole-5" scientific station successfully completed a half-year research plan. In the six months since the establishment of this scientific station, scientists have collected a lot of new materials related to oceanography, atmospheric science, geomagnetism, the ionosphere, and other phenomena, enriching their understanding of the Arctic nature. They have identified many characteristics of the Arctic Ocean region where the scientific station drifted. In particular, they discovered a large branch of the Lomonosov underwater mountain range that rises 1,500 to 1,700 meters above the seabed. Recently, the staff of the scientific station also discovered an interesting phenomenon: a powerful layer of warm air invaded high-latitude areas, this layer of air floated at an altitude of about 1,500 meters, and the air temperature was about 10 degrees Celsius, but the temperature on the ice floe was below zero. These materials have been sent to the Soviet Arctic Scientific Research Institute for research.

Xinhua News Agency, October 29th—TASS reports: A comprehensive Antarctic scientific expedition team organized by the Soviet Academy of Sciences will depart in November. At present, the preparations for the scientific research of the expedition team are about to be completed soon. The members of the expedition team have been organized, including well-known scientists in various fields and scientific workers with rich exploration experience; the expedition team also includes one hundred construction workers.

The "Ob", an ocean-going vessel with a displacement of more than 12,000 tons used by the expedition team, is about to be equipped with all necessary equipment. Six laboratories, including hydrology, geology, and meteorology, are being set up on board. The construction of the helicopter landing pad has been completed. The work of installing take-off equipment for transport planes on the deck is about to be completed soon. The ship will be equipped with the latest navigation instruments and modern radio equipment, which can enable the expedition team to maintain constant contact with Moscow and other places. The "Ob" will transport tractors, automobiles, power station equipment, a large amount of fuel, and many other working and living utensils. Due to the large amount of cargo, the "Lena" transport ship has been designated to accompany the "Ob" to Antarctica.

Great care has been given to the life, cultural and recreational activities of the expedition members and sailors. Comfortable cabins have been arranged for them. The ship is equipped with a cultural room, film projection equipment, a library, sports facilities, and recreational equipment. Their clothing and food will be manufactured and selected with special care so that they can adapt to the local natural conditions.

    苏联科学家在北极继续进行研究并积极准备去南极
    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社报道：目前，苏联“北极—五号”漂流科学站正处在北极夜的阴沉沉的天气的笼罩下。那里的气温常常在摄氏零下二、三十度，雪花纷飞，风速常常达到每秒二十公尺。科学站所在地的浮冰向西漂流的速度已经增加，越过了洛蒙诺索夫海底山脊。科学站的工作人员正在依靠新的电气保暖设备、照明设备、新的通气和无线电装备的帮助，继续展开正常的科学研究活动，有些观测工作甚至还扩大了。
    不久以前，“北极—五号”科学站的工作人员胜利地完成了半年的研究计划。在这个科学站成立以来的半年中，科学家们已经搜集了许多有关海洋学、大气学，地磁、电离层和其他现象的新材料，丰富了对于北极自然的了解。他们已经辨明科学站漂流过的北冰洋地区的许多特点。他们特别发现了洛蒙诺索夫海底山脉的一个高出海底一千五百到一千七百公尺的大支脉。最近科学站的工作人员还发现了一个有趣的现象：强大的暖空气层侵入了高纬度地区，这层空气大约漂浮在一千五百公尺高空处，空气的温度约为摄氏零上十度，但浮冰上的温度却在零度以下。这些材料已经送交苏联北极科学研究所加以研究。
    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社报道：由苏联科学院组织的一个综合性的南极科学考察队，在十一月间就要出发了。目前，为考察队的科学研究进行的各项准备工作很快就要完成，考察队的人员已经组织好了，其中包括各种专业的著名科学家、有极丰富地考察经验的科学工作者；考察队中还包括一百个建筑工作者。
    供考察队使用的排水量一万二千多吨的“鄂毕号”远洋轮船即将装好一切必要的设备。船上正在设立水文、地质、气象等六个实验室。直升飞机降落场的工程已经完成了。在甲板上安装运输机用的起飞设备的工作很快就要完成。轮船上将配备有最新式的航行仪器和现代化的无线电设备，可以使考察队同莫斯科和其他地方保持经常的联系。“鄂毕号”轮船将运去拖拉机、汽车、电站设备、大量的燃料和其他许多工作和生活上的用具。由于货物很多，已经指定“勒拿号”运输船随“鄂毕号”到南极去。
    考察队人员和海员的生活和文娱活动得到了极大的关怀。已经为他们布置了舒适的船舱。船上设有文化室、电影放映设备、图书馆、运动场所和文娱工具。他们的衣着和食物都将经过特别精细的制造和挑选，使他们能够适应当地的自然条件。
