Xinhua News Agency, 30th — The Japanese Kabuki Troupe, consisting of 57 members, arrived in Beijing by plane on the afternoon of the 30th, invited by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries for a performance tour in China.

The Japanese Kabuki Troupe is led by the head of the troupe, Kunizo Matsuo, the leading actor, Ennosuke Ichikawa, and the deputy heads, Tomio Narasaki and Chusha Ichikawa. The troupe members include many famous Kabuki actors. Kabuki is an excellent classical drama of Japan with national tradition and unique style. This performance in China is the second large-scale performance of Japanese Kabuki abroad.

Those who went to the airport to welcome the Japanese artists today included Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, famous dramatists, dancers, Peking Opera actors Tian Han, Mei Lanfang, Cao Yu, Dai Ailian, Yuan Shihai, Ye Shengzhang, Luo Heru, Japanese people currently in Beijing, Togo Kameda, Kenta Kaneko, and more than 300 young literary and art workers from Beijing.

Kunizo Matsuo, Ennosuke Ichikawa, and the troupe members received flowers from young Chinese literary and art workers after getting off the plane. Yang Hansheng delivered a welcome speech saying: The friendship and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese peoples have a long historical tradition. Now the Japanese Kabuki Troupe has taken on the task of cultural envoys of the Japanese people and come to Beijing. We believe that the Kabuki Troupe's visit and performance in China and the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe's visit and performance in Japan next year will greatly enhance the ties and cooperation between the cultural circles of the two countries and make more contributions to the friendly unity of the Chinese and Japanese peoples and the normalization of relations between the two countries.

Kunizo Matsuo and Ennosuke Ichikawa delivered a reply speech on behalf of the Kabuki Troupe, thanking them for the grand welcome they received in China. Kunizo Matsuo said: This visit to China by the Kabuki Troupe is an unforgettable historical friendly visit between the two countries, and it is also our honor. The grand send-off the Kabuki Troupe received in Tokyo shows that the Japanese people hope to be friendly with China. In their speeches, they expressed that they would do a good job in their performances in China and strive to promote the early visit of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe to Japan. (Attached picture)
