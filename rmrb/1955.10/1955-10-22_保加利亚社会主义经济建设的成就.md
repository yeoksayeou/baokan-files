Achievements of Bulgaria's Socialist Economic Construction
Gé· Zhānkēfū, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria

For eleven years, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people have advanced rapidly along the road of socialist construction. Bulgaria has achieved great successes in economic construction.

Our people are satisfied to see that on the occasion of the eleventh National Day on September 9th this year, the plan for the first two and a half years of our Second Five-Year Plan has been successfully completed.

This victory was achieved on the basis of our completion of the First Five-Year Plan. The basic task of the First Five-Year Plan was to lay the foundations of socialism through national industrialization and the development of electrification, and through the collectivization and mechanization of agriculture. The main aspects of this task were successfully completed within four years.

The First Five-Year Plan stipulated that the industrial production development plan for 1953 was overfulfilled by 20 percent by the end of 1952. Thanks to the establishment of a series of new machine manufacturing plants and the reconstruction of existing factories, we created our own machine manufacturing industry during this period. The construction of the Stalin Chemical Plant and other chemical plants laid a solid foundation for our heavy chemical industry. During the First Five-Year Plan, we appropriately increased the production of lead, zinc, copper, iron, and pyrite, which created favorable conditions for the development of ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting. In 1952, electricity production increased by one and a half times compared to 1948, and coal mining increased by approximately 74 percent.

As a result of the rapid development of the entire industry, by the end of 1952, the proportion of industrial output value in the total value of the national economy had reached 55.9 percent, while agriculture accounted for 26 percent. Bulgaria has changed from a backward agricultural country to an industrial-agricultural country. Capitalist elements in industry, transportation, domestic and foreign trade have been squeezed out.

By the end of 1952, 52.3 percent of peasant households had joined cooperatives, and their cultivated land area accounted for 60.5 percent of the total cultivated land area in the country. One hundred and forty machine tractor stations have been built, owning more than 12,000 fifteen-horsepower tractors, more than 1,300 combine harvesters, and other agricultural machinery. The capitalist economy in rural areas has been restricted and squeezed out, and they are no longer an important part of agricultural production.

All these achievements have created the necessary conditions for further developing the national economy and significantly improving the lives of the working people during the Second Five-Year Plan.

The main tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan put forward by the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party are: to further develop heavy industry, especially the electricity and coal industries, and eliminate the phenomenon that these industries lag behind the needs of the country; to develop large-scale geological exploration work to develop our country's natural resources; to further develop agriculture, especially animal husbandry, and eliminate the backwardness in this area; to greatly increase the production of consumer goods; to carry out a campaign to greatly increase labor productivity, etc.

The Bulgarian people are successfully completing these tasks.

In the first two and a half years of the Second Five-Year Plan, the output of industrial products was almost equal to the output of the entire First Five-Year Plan. The output of industrial products in the first six months of this year alone was 6 percent more than the total output of 1949, and more than two and a half times that of 1939.

The production of means of production has grown faster than the production of consumer goods, which is of great significance for the rapid development of national production capacity. It is expected that by the end of 1955, the total industrial output will increase by 35 percent compared to 1952, and the production of means of production will increase by 50 percent.

In the initial years of the Second Five-Year Plan, the Party and the government took decisive steps to eliminate the deficiencies in electricity and coal production. As a result, electricity production in 1954 increased by approximately 28 percent compared to 1952. Calculated on a per capita basis, our country's power generation this year is expected to reach 270 kWh per person. The achievements in electricity production have largely resolved the contradiction between electricity production capacity and national needs. The phenomenon of insufficient coal supply has also been largely overcome. Coal output in the first half of this year has exceeded more than twice that of 1939. Industry, other sectors of the national economy, and residents will be able to receive normal coal supplies this year. The task of mechanizing coal mine production in the Five-Year Plan is nearing completion.

The directives of the Second Five-Year Plan did not stipulate the production of petroleum. However, based on the oilfields that have been discovered, we have the potential to produce more than 150,000 tons of crude oil and a certain amount of other petroleum products. Currently, the work of exploring oilfields is proceeding at the same rapid pace and on a much larger scale than before.

Our ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting industry is developing rapidly. In the recent two and a half years, two open-hearth furnaces and a rolling mill of the "Lenin" National Metallurgical Plant have been put into production. Therefore, this year, except for a small amount of shaped steel, our country will stop importing steel bars. The construction of our country's first blast furnace at the "Lenin" National Metallurgical Plant is also underway. Our metallurgical industry has laid a solid foundation.

In terms of the production of machinery industry and steel industry, compared with 1952, the increase in 1955 will be no less than 55 percent. During these two and a half years, we have mastered the production of many new machines, including more than 200 new agricultural machines and equipment, coal mining industrial machines and construction machines, such as combine harvesters, beet harvesters and cultivators, traction mowers, single-chain and double-chain conveyors, and 500-meter deep drilling machines, etc.

Our country's achievements in heavy chemical industry are also quite significant. In 1954, the Karl Marx Soda Ash Factory and the Penicillin Factory were put into production. It can now be seen that by the end of this year, the output of soda ash and penicillin will greatly exceed the output stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1957. The production of chlortetracycline is also largely ready. The Stalin Chemical Plant has also achieved important achievements. In 1954, this factory produced more than 2,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, exceeding the output stipulated by the Five-Year Plan for 1957, and also produced some other chemical products during this period. Due to this progress in the chemical industry, our country has not only stopped importing soda ash, penicillin, and other chemical products, but also is able to export a considerable amount of these items. Due to the abundance of raw materials, our country's basic chemical industry will be developed even further.

While constantly realizing the national industrialization, we are fully aware of the fact that our country is an inseparable part of the entire socialist camp. Therefore, we do not need to promote the simultaneous development of all industrial sectors.

In addition to caring about the rapid development of heavy industry, the Party and the government also pay close attention to the development of light industry and the food industry.

The amount of cotton fabrics, wool fabrics, and silk fabrics produced in the first half of this year alone is more than the total production volume of 1948.

Since 1953, our country's annual cotton fabric output, calculated on a per capita basis, has been more than three meters more than that of Greece and almost eight meters more than that of Turkey.

By the end of this year, compared with 1952, it is expected that the output of radios will increase more than six times, metal utensils will increase nearly 1.5 times, and the output of sugar will increase by about 1.5 times. Workers in light industry and food industry enterprises are working hard to improve the quality of products and increase varieties.

Our country's transportation industry, railways, water transport, and road transportation have also achieved corresponding development. Air transport is also advancing.

We have also made considerable achievements in labor productivity. Compared with 1939, labor productivity in 1954 almost doubled.

In the First Five-Year Plan, due to the reduction of product costs in industry, a total of 2.8 billion leva (Bulgarian currency) was saved. In the two and a half years of the Second Five-Year Plan, 2.4 billion leva has already been saved.

However, we believe that our country's labor productivity is still not high, which cannot meet the needs of socialist construction. Recently, we have taken stricter measures to improve this situation and have achieved some success.

One of the major problems that the Party and the government constantly face is the agricultural problem. In the past few years, we have been particularly concerned about further developing agriculture, consolidating agricultural production cooperatives and state farms, and increasing the output of planting and animal husbandry.

In this regard, the resolutions announced by the Party and the government at the beginning of this year are of great significance. According to these resolutions, investment will be made in the mechanization of agricultural work, and the in-kind remuneration for the work done by machine tractor stations will be reduced by an average of half, and the cash portion will be reduced by 35 percent. In addition, many improvements have been made in issues such as loans to cooperative farmers, purchase prices of agricultural products, and freight rates.

Since the end of 1954, more than 2,500 Party cadres and economic workers have been dispatched to rural areas to work, of which 683 have been elected as chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives.

This year, there are 18,350 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower) in our country's agriculture, an increase of about half compared to 1952; there are about 3,379 grain combine harvesters, an increase of about one and a half times compared to 1952.

In 1955, the irrigated area increased by 33 percent compared to 1952.

In the past two and a half years, our country's agriculture has made significant achievements.

In the Second Five-Year Plan, the average annual output of grain, including the estimated output of 1955, will exceed the average annual output of the First Five-Year Plan by 9 percent.

In the past few years, agricultural production cooperatives have achieved higher harvests in all aspects than individual farmers. This brilliantly proves the superiority of the socialist method in agriculture over the capitalist method. The relative output of the socialist sector (state farms and agricultural production cooperatives) has also steadily increased.

Along with the achievements in planting, certain achievements have also been made in the development of animal husbandry, mainly in the socialist sector. Compared with 1952, the number of cattle in agricultural production cooperatives in 1955 is expected to increase by 20 percent, sheep by 23 percent, pigs by one time, and poultry by 74 percent. Greater achievements have been made in improving the productivity of livestock products.

The economic achievements made by agricultural production cooperatives in the past few years have continuously increased its prestige among cooperative households and individual farmers. A new upsurge of working farmers joining agricultural production cooperatives is bound to occur in our country's rural areas. This shows the correctness of our line of developing agriculture and shows the practical achievements of the socialist sector in rural areas.

The achievements in agriculture are obvious when compared with the results of the First Five-Year Plan. The total output of planting and animal husbandry has achieved certain achievements. But from the perspective of completing the resolutions of the Sixth Party Congress, from the perspective of the interests of farmers, supplying residents with food, and supplying industry with raw materials, these achievements are obviously not satisfactory. Agriculture is still lagging behind the needs of the country.

In agriculture, we still need to do a lot of work in the rational use of technology, water conservancy irrigation, fertilization, and in cultivation and animal husbandry, in order to further increase the average yield.

The development of the socialist component of industry and agriculture has not only consolidated our country's finances, but also improved the living standards of our people. By the end of this year, trade will increase by about 60 percent compared to 1952. In the first half of this year alone, the amount of sugar, pastries, rice, lentils, canned food, silk and wool fabrics, cotton and wool fabrics, and many other items purchased by residents is almost equal to the total amount of 1951. This not only shows the increase in the production of daily necessities, but also shows the steady growth of the purchasing power of the working people. At the same time, due to the reduction of retail prices implemented between 1953 and 1955, residents received more than 3 billion leva in benefits.

The increase in the savings of the working people is a true manifestation of the continuous improvement of the lives of the working people. Due to the constantly growing possibility in this regard, it is expected that the savings plan will be exceeded by two times this year. This shows the stability of our country's currency and the trust of our working people in it.

In addition to the housing construction undertaken by the state, due to the state's preferential loans, the construction of private residences by residents has also developed in the past two years. In the past few years, many brand new and comfortable houses have been built in our country's rural areas. Under the care of the state, social welfare and cultural education undertakings have been continuously developed.

All these achievements are primarily the result of the correct policies adopted by the Party for our country's socialist construction and the huge organizational work carried out among the masses, and the result of the heroic and enthusiastic labor of our country's working class, working farmers, and people's intellectuals in completing the plan.

At the same time, these undeniable achievements that our country has made in developing its economy and culture are inseparable from the assistance provided by the Soviet Union to our country in economic, cultural, scientific, and technological aspects, mutual assistance and cooperation with other people's democratic countries, and the common pursuit of a peaceful policy with the countries of the democratic camp headed by the great Soviet Union.

The achievements of our socialist construction prove that our people's democratic system, our socialist new system is becoming more and more consolidated. The unity of the Patriotic Front of the masses of patriotic people around the Bulgarian Communist Party is constantly developing and strengthening. The worker-peasant alliance—the unbreakable foundation of our people's regime—is becoming more and more consolidated.

These pleasant achievements make the Bulgarian people firmly believe that the road the Bulgarian Communist Party is leading them is the only correct road. This road is the road to the comprehensive development and prosperity of our country, the road to happiness and prosperity.

    保加利亚社会主义经济建设的成就
    保加利亚共产党中央委员会政治局委员  保加利亚人民共和国部长会议副主席  格·詹科夫
    保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，十一年来沿着社会主义建设的道路迅速前进。在经济建设方面，保加利亚已经获得了巨大的成就。
    我国人民满意地看到：在今年九月九日第十一届国庆节之际，我国第二个五年计划的头两年半计划已经胜利地完成了。
    这个胜利是在我国完成了第一个五年计划的基础上获得的。第一个五年计划的基本任务是通过国家工业化和发展电气化，并通过农业的合作化和机械化，奠定社会主义的基础。这个任务的主要方面在四年的时间内便胜利地完成了。
    第一个五年计划规定到一九五三年的工业生产发展计划，早在一九五二年底便超额百分之二十完成了。由于建立了一系列新的机器制造厂并改建了原有的工厂，我们在这个时期创立了自己的机器制造业。斯大林化学工厂和其他化学工厂的建成，为我国的重化学工业打下了牢固的基础。在第一个五年计划期间，我们适当地增加了铅、锌、铜、铁和黄铁矿的生产，这就为黑色和有色金属冶炼业的发展创造了有利的条件。在一九五二年，电力生产比一九四八年增加了一倍半，煤的开采量约增加了百分之七十四。
    由于整个工业迅速发展的结果，到一九五二年底，工业产值在整个国民经济生产总值中所占比重已达到百分之五十五点九，而农业占百分之二十六。保加利亚已从一个落后的农业国变成为一个工业—农业国。工业、运输业、国内外贸易中的资本主义成分已经被排挤出去了。
    在一九五二年底，百分之五十二点三的农户已经参加了合作社，它们的耕地面积占全国耕地总面积的百分之六十点五。一百四十个机器拖拉机站已经建成，它们拥有一万二千部以上十五马力的拖拉机，一千三百部以上的联合收割机以及其他农业机器。农村中的资本主义经济受到限制和排挤，它们已经不再是农业生产中的重要部分了。
    所有这些成就都为第二个五年计划期间进一步发展国民经济和显著地改善劳动人民的生活创造了必要的条件。
    保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会提出的第二个五年计划的主要任务是：进一步发展重工业，特别是电力和煤炭工业，消除这些工业落后于国家需要的现象；发展大规模的地质勘探工作，以开发我国的天然富源；进一步发展农业，特别是畜牧业，消除这方面的落后状态；大大地增加消费品的生产；开展一个极大地提高劳动生产率的运动，等等。
    保加利亚人民正在顺利地完成着这些任务。
    在第二个五年计划的头两年半中，工业品的产量几乎等于整个第一个五年计划期间的产量。单是今年头六个月中工业品的产量就比一九四九年全年的产量多百分之六，为一九三九年的两倍半以上。
    生产资料的生产比消费资料的生产获得更快的增长，这对于国家生产能力的迅速发展有着重要的意义。预计到一九五五年底，工业总产量将比一九五二年增加百分之三十五，而生产资料的生产将增加百分之五十。
    在第二个五年计划的最初几年中，党和政府就采取了决定性的步骤以消除电力和煤炭生产的不足现象。结果，电力生产在一九五四年比一九五二年增长了约百分之二十八。按人口平均分配，我国今年的发电量预计将达到每人二百七十瓩时。电力生产方面所获得的成就已经大体上解决了电力生产能力和国家需要之间的矛盾。煤炭供应不足的现象也已经大体克服了。今年上半年的煤产量已经超过一九三九年的两倍以上。工业、国民经济其他部门以及居民在今年都能得到正常的煤炭供应。五年计划中关于煤矿生产机械化的任务已经接近实现。
    在第二个五年计划的指示中，并没有规定生产石油。但是，就目前已发现的油矿来说，我们已有可能生产十五万吨以上的原油和一定数量的其他石油产品。目前，勘探油矿的工作正以同样快的速度和较前大得多的规模在进行着。
    我国的黑色和有色金属冶炼业正在迅速地发展。在最近两年半中，“列宁”国家冶金工厂的两座平炉和一所轧钢场已经投入生产。因此，今年除少量的型钢外，我国将停止钢条的进口。“列宁”国家冶金工厂的我国第一座高炉也正在建设中。我国的冶金工业已经奠定了牢固的基础。
    在机械工业和钢铁工业的生产方面，同一九五二年比较，一九五五年的增加数将不少于百分之五十五。在这两年半的期间，我们已经掌握了许多新机器的生产，包括二百种以上新的农业机器和装备，采煤工业机器和建筑机器，例如联合收割机、甜菜收割机和耕种机、牵引割草机、单链和双链运输机以及五百公尺深的钻孔机等。
    我国重化学工业的成就也是相当巨大的。在一九五四年，卡尔·马克思制碱工厂和青霉素工厂都已投入生产。现在已经可以看出，到今年年底，苏打灰和青霉素的产量将大大超过五年计划为一九五七年规定的产量。金霉素的生产也大致准备就绪。斯大林化学工厂也已经获得重要的成就。在一九五四年内，这个工厂出产了二千吨以上的氮肥，超过五年计划为一九五七年规定的产量，而且在这个期间还生产了一些其他的化学产品。由于化学工业中的这一进展，我国不仅已经停止进口苏打灰、青霉素和其他化学产品，而且能够输出相当数量的这类物品。由于原料丰富，我国的基本化学工业将得到更大的发展。
    在不断地实现着国家工业化的同时，我们并充分注意到我国是整个社会主义阵营中不可分割的一部分的这一事实。因此我们无需促进一切工业部门的同时发展。
    除了关心迅速发展重工业之外，党和政府还十分注意发展轻工业和食品工业。
    只在今年上半年所生产的棉织品、毛织品和丝织品就比一九四八年全年的生产量还要多。
    自从一九五三年以来，我国的棉织品年产量如按人口平均计算，已比希腊多三公尺多，几乎比土耳其多八公尺。
    到今年年底，同一九五二年比较，预料收音机的产量将增加六倍多，金属器皿将增加近一点五倍，糖的产量将增加约一点五倍。轻工业和食品工业企业中的工人们正在努力改进产品的质量和增加品种。
    我国的运输事业，铁路、水运和公路交通也已获得相应的发展。航空运输也在前进着。
    我们在劳动生产率方面也获得了相当的成就。同一九三九年比较，一九五四年的劳动生产率几乎提高了一倍。
    在第一个五年计划里，由于在工业中降低产品成本，共节约了二十八亿利瓦（保币）。在第二个五年计划的两年半里，就已经节约了二十四亿利瓦。
    但是，我们认为我国的劳动生产率还是不高，这就不能满足社会主义建设的需要。近来，我们已经采取了较严格的措施来改进这方面的情况，并已取得了一些成就。
    党和政府经常面临着的重大问题之一，就是农业问题。过去几年，我们特别关怀进一步发展农业、巩固农业生产合作社和国营农场以及增加种植业和畜牧业产量的问题。
    在这方面，党和政府在今年年初所公布的决议有着重大的意义。根据这些决议，将对农业工作的机械化进行投资，对机器拖拉机站所作工作的实物报酬平均将减低一半，现款部分将减低百分之三十五。此外，在对合作社农民们的贷款，农产品收购价格和运费等问题上也采取了许多改进的措施。
    自从一九五四年年底以来，二千五百多个党的干部和经济工作人员，已被派遣到农村中去担任工作，其中有六百八十三人已被选为农业生产合作社的主席。
    今年，我国农业中已有一万八千三百五十台拖拉机（每台以十五马力计算），比一九五二年增加了大约一半；约有三千三百七十九台谷物联合收割机，比一九五二年增加了大约一倍半。
    一九五五年，灌溉面积比一九五二年增加了百分之三十三。
    在过去的两年半里，我国的农业已获得了显著的成就。
    在第二个五年计划里，谷物的每年平均产量，包括一九五五年的预计产量，将超过第一个五年计划每年平均产量百分之九。
    过去几年，农业生产合作社比个体农民在各方面都取得了更高的收获量。这就光辉地证明了农业中的社会主义方式对资本主义方式的优越性。社会主义部分（国营农场和农业生产合作社）的相对产量也稳步地增加了。
    和种植业取得成就的同时，在发展畜牧业方面也取得一定的成就，这主要是在社会主义部分。同一九五二年相比，一九五五年农业生产合作社中牛的头数预计将增加百分之二十，羊百分之二十三，猪一倍，家禽百分之七十四。在提高牲畜产品生产率方面获得了更高的成就。
    过去几年里农业生产合作社中所取得的经济成就，不断提高了它对合作户和个体农户的威信。在我国农村势将出现劳动农民加入农业生产合作社的新的高潮。这说明了我们发展农业的路线的正确性，并显示了社会主义部分在农村中的实际成就。
    在农业方面所获得的成就和第一个五年计划的结果比较起来，是明显无疑的。种植业和畜牧业的总生产量已获得肯定的成就。但是从完成第六次党代表大会的决议的角度来看，从农民的利益、供应居民以粮食和工业以原料的角度来看，这些成就显然是不能令人满意的。农业仍然落后于国家的需要。
    在农业中我们还需要在合理使用技术、水利灌溉、施肥以及在耕种和饲畜方面作许多工作，以便进一步提高平均产量。
    工农业社会主义成分的发展，不但巩固了我国的财政，而且还提高了我国人民的生活水平。到今年年底，贸易将比一九五二年增加约百分之六十。只在今年上半年，居民购买的糖、糕点、大米、扁豆、罐头食品、丝毛织品、棉毛织品和许多其他物品的数量，几乎等于一九五一年全年的数量。这不仅说明日用品工业生产的增加，而且还说明劳动人民购买力的稳步增长。同时，由于一九五三年和一九五五年间实行减低零售价格的结果，居民获得了三十亿多利瓦的好处。
    劳动人民储蓄的增加，是劳动人民生活不断获得改善的一个真实表现。由于这方面不断增长的可能性，预料今年还将要超过储蓄计划的二倍。这说明了我国货币的稳定性和我国劳动人民对它的信任。
    除了国家从事的房屋建设之外，由于国家的优惠贷款，在过去两年中居民的私人住宅建设也获得发展。过去的几年里，在我国的农村里建立了许多崭新舒适的房子。在国家的关怀下，社会福利和文化教育事业得到不断的发展。
    所有这些成就，首先是党为了我国社会主义建设所采取的正确政策和在群众中所进行的巨大组织工作的结果，是我国工人阶级、劳动农民和人民知识分子为完成计划所作出的英勇和热情劳动的结果。
    同时，我国在发展经济和文化方面所获得的这些无可置辩的成就，也是同苏联在经济、文化、科学和技术方面对我国进行的援助，同其他人民民主国家互助合作，以及和以伟大的苏联为首的民主阵营各国共同奉行和平政策分不开的。
    我国社会主义建设的成就证明，我们人民民主制度的国家、我们的社会主义的新的制度越来越巩固了。围绕着保加利亚共产党的爱国主义的人民大众的祖国阵线的团结，正在不断发展和加强。工农联盟——我国人民政权的牢不可破的基础越来越巩固了。
    这些愉快的成就使保加利亚人民深信：保加利亚共产党领导他们走的道路是唯一正确的道路。这条道路就是通向我国全面发展和兴盛的道路，通向幸福和繁荣的道路。
