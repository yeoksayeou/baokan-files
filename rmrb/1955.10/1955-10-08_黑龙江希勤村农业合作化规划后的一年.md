A year has passed since the implementation of the comprehensive agricultural cooperativization plan in Xiqin Village, Shuangcheng County, Heilongjiang Province. What work has the Party organization in this village done in the past year? What changes have taken place in the village?

The first major event encountered by the six new cooperatives before they went into production this spring was the issue of production investment. Initially, members of each cooperative tried their best to report the amount of their investment. The village Party branch was very satisfied with this phenomenon, believing that there would be no problems. But that's when the problems arose. After the leading cadres of each cooperative reported their investments, they generally worried that the poor peasants would not be able to afford it. Some well-off middle peasants said to the poor peasants: "This time, we'll see if you actively want to join the cooperative!" Some cooperatives even estimated the wealth of the poor peasants. As a result, the poor peasants in each cooperative tried their best to invest, some even investing the sorghum stalks they used for burning and the rations they had prepared, and some sold pigs to make up their investment. However, some well-off middle peasants not only invested last, but most of them did not invest completely.

"What is the problem?" The Party branch held a branch committee meeting to discuss it. The branch committee members recognized this as a phenomenon of excluding poor peasants. However, during the cooperativization plan last year, everyone felt that they had paid attention to the issue of relying on poor peasants. After the plan, the poor peasants had in fact joined the cooperative, so the branch committee members felt that the problem of excluding poor peasants in the cooperative would no longer exist, and that the phenomenon of excluding poor peasants would only occur when establishing new cooperatives or expanding existing ones. With the help of the district committee, the branch committee criticized this erroneous thinking and realized that the comprehensive plan was only the beginning of the Party's planned leadership of the cooperativization movement, and that it was still necessary to constantly adhere to the Party's class policy within the cooperative.

The Party branch analyzed that the reason for excluding poor peasants on the issue of investment was that the middle peasants were afraid that the poor peasants would "take advantage." What were they worried about when they thought the poor peasants would "take advantage?" The Party branch found that the rental prices of carts, horses, and farm implements in some cooperatives were unreasonable, and that the cooperatives that had production materials assessed and contributed to the cooperative also had not stipulated how many years the money would be repaid. In light of this situation, the Party branch educated the Party members and members of each cooperative on the principle of "mutual benefit and harm in separation" between poor and middle peasants in running the cooperative well, explaining that it was wrong to exclude poor peasants in investment, and that it was also wrong to let middle peasants suffer losses by not determining reasonable prices for production materials. The branch committee members also went to each cooperative to specifically help solve the problem of unity between poor and middle peasants.

Wen Zhimin, a poor peasant who was excluded from the cooperative when it was established last year, was placed in Yongfeng Cooperative during the planning, and was discriminated against by well-off middle peasants such as Nan Qingfu. Nan Qingfu and others often muttered in front of Wen Zhimin and other poor peasants who joined later: It's appropriate for you to join the cooperative, others have already laid the foundation for your family. The Party branch sent people to this cooperative to study the reasons why Nan Qingfu and others wanted to exclude the poor peasants, mainly because he had a rubber-wheeled cart that was not assessed when he joined the cooperative. Therefore, they helped the cooperative first study and determine the price of the cart and the repayment period, and then told Nan Qingfu that the peasants who joined the cooperative all labored the same, and the production materials were given a reasonable price, so no one would take advantage of anyone, and explained the importance of the poor peasants uniting with the middle peasants to run the cooperative well. Nan Qingfu felt that what he had done in the past was wrong; the poor peasant Wen Zhimin also did not feel wronged, and was very motivated to work.

Li Guocai, a middle peasant in the agricultural production cooperative led by Wen Lianshan, was always worried that poor households would "gnaw" at him. When he saw that the firewood of poor household Wang Guobin was gone, he said to the cooperative director: "Look, his firewood pile is gone, we'll have to give it to him, why not just 'kick' him out!" After hearing these words, the Party branch secretary Yu Wenhua talked to him and said to him: "You used to be a person who suffered a lot. You rented a few hectares of land from the landlord and could not afford to eat or wear every year. You should remember being afraid of the landlord asking for accounts, running away on New Year's Eve, and not having a good New Year every year. Now that your life is better, but there are still some poor peasants who are not doing well because of production difficulties. Isn't joining the cooperative to completely get rid of that root of poverty? Besides, production materials in the cooperative have reasonable prices, how can you suffer losses?" Li Guocai was so sad that he shed tears, saying that he had "forgotten the pain once the scar healed."

After solving these problems, the Party branch also paid attention to helping the poor peasants solve difficulties economically, which further promoted the unity between the poor and middle peasants. After the agricultural production cooperative led by Chang Tai prohibited the new rich peasant Liu Jingshan, who had eight horses, from joining the cooperative, the number of horses in the entire cooperative was reduced by half, and the average burden of each animal power increased from more than seven hectares of land to more than ten hectares of land. However, because the state bank and credit cooperative loaned two horses and some fodder, and the leading cadres of the cooperative mobilized four poor peasants to buy four horses, the problem of plowing animals was solved, and the spring plowing and summer weeding were done very well. In this way, the poor peasants were more convinced that under the leadership of the Party, there were no difficulties that could not be overcome in running the cooperative; the middle peasants also said, "I never dreamed that such a poor cooperative could be run so well," and Li Fenggui, a middle peasant who planned to withdraw from the cooperative after the autumn harvest, did not withdraw from the cooperative.

Because the Party branch further implemented the class policy after the cooperativization plan, the balance of class forces in Xiqin Village has changed greatly in the past year. When the cooperative was established last year, it was competing for rich peasants, and the rich peasants "took control" of the cooperative, the middle peasants hesitated and wavered, and the poor peasants were excluded. The situation this year is just the opposite. The poor peasants have become the backbone of running the cooperative, and the middle peasants have moved closer to the poor peasants and are also actively running the cooperative, which has isolated the rich peasants. Some rich peasants have "asked people to intercede" and "probe the wind," and have repeatedly expressed their "request" to join the cooperative, but they have been rejected. Not to mention the landlords, they often "flatter" and "express their determination" to join the cooperative in front of the poor peasants. The poor peasants smile and say: Be honest and work outside the cooperative, and we'll call you to join the cooperative when it's time!

Although the comprehensive plan for cooperativization in Xiqin Village has allocated the backbone forces, only eight people in the eight cooperatives know how to lead the cooperative, and most of them are leading the cooperative for the first time. Therefore, the Party branch accepted the experience of other places and decided to establish a mutual aid and cooperation network with the old cooperative, Yongfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative, as the focus. During the spring plowing, the Party branch, based on the chaotic work and the inability of the management committee to grasp the situation in each cooperative, studied and formulated the cooperative's quarterly plan and small-section plan in Yongfeng Cooperative, implemented the method of graded contracting, and divided the work of the management committee. Then, through the mutual aid and cooperation network, it convened a meeting of the management committees of each cooperative, introduced the practices of Yongfeng Cooperative, and the Party branch committee members went to each cooperative to help, so that each cooperative arranged production more systematically during the spring plowing, and the members of the cooperative all reflected that they "grasped the situation." By the time of summer weeding, each cooperative felt that they could not grasp the situation, and the directors of each cooperative generally reflected: There is too much work and they are too busy. After the Party branch conducted research in Yongfeng Cooperative, it decided to mobilize the members of the cooperative to discuss and formulate the summer weeding production plan of the cooperative, and then launched a competition to encourage the labor enthusiasm of the members. As a result, the labor efficiency was improved. It was in this way that through the training in actual production, the members of the cooperative gradually "entered the door" of the cooperative. By the time of the end of the hoeing, in just eight or nine months, twenty-two of the thirty-two Party members in the village could independently lead the cooperative, plus the Youth League members and activists among the masses who had learned how to run the cooperative, each cooperative had five or six backbone members who could handle general affairs within the cooperative. Each cooperative reflected: Running the cooperative is no longer a matter of concern for a few people, everyone is involved.

After each cooperative started production in the spring, the Party branch felt that it should give full play to the superiority of the agricultural cooperative. Therefore, it learned from the experience of production planning in other villages, and each cooperative implemented production planning. In the past, the most troubling thing for the village leaders was that no one planted the more than forty hectares of public land in the village, and they had to push it out every spring plowing. But this spring, when the whole village carried out production planning, each cooperative competed to take it, and later the Party branch specially held a meeting to conduct a reasonable distribution before solving the problem. Not only that, but each cooperative squeezed out resources to open up two hectares of wasteland during spring plowing. From the current situation, each cooperative can exceed the measures and requirements put forward in the production plan. It was originally planned that each set of new agricultural tools would sow forty-five hectares of land. As a result, due to the joint use of each cooperative and team, "people and horses rested but the machines did not," each set of new agricultural tools sowed an average of more than fifty hectares of land. It is estimated that the one hundred and fifty-two hectares of wheat, sorghum, and soybeans planted with new agricultural tools this year can increase production by more than 85,000 kilograms of grain compared to those planted with old agricultural tools. The area of ​​fertilizer application in the whole village reached 95% of the total cultivated area, exceeding the plan by 5%. The planting area of ​​corn has also been expanded. According to the current situation, although the corn planting area in the village only accounts for one-third of the planting area of ​​grain crops in the village, the output exceeds one-half of the total grain output in the village. Because each cooperative produces well and the rainfall is moderate, this year the income of the members of the two old cooperatives can be increased by more than 30% compared with last year, and the income of the members of the six new cooperatives can be increased by more than 50% compared with the mutual aid group, which is 20% to 30% higher than the income of the mutual aid group outside the cooperative. Under the leadership of the agricultural cooperative, the farmers in the mutual aid group have done a good job in production, and the income of the group members can also be increased by about 30% compared with last year.

Because the agricultural production cooperatives in the village have good production and increased income, plus the four mutual aid groups were appropriately matched during the planning last year, the leading cadres were separated, and they were respectively linked to the cooperatives within the mutual aid and cooperation network, now, the enthusiasm of the members of the mutual aid group to join the cooperative is increasing day by day. Among the eighty-one farmers outside the cooperative in the village, fifty-five have already requested to join the cooperative.

The prestige of the village Party branch among the farmers is also getting higher and higher. Now, when dealing with various major matters in the village, the farmers have to look at the attitude of the Party branch, saying "do whatever the branch tells them to do." The people's high trust in the Party makes the Party members and branch committee members in the village feel that their responsibilities are greater and more glorious. Yu Wenhua, the secretary of the Party branch, said: "The work in the future is different from before, and it needs more comprehensive planning and stronger leadership."

    黑龙江希勤村农业合作化规划后的一年
    刘万祥
    黑龙江省双城县希勤村实行农业合作化的全面规划已经一年了。一年来，这个村的党的组织做了一些什么工作呢？村内发生了一些什么变化呢？
    今年春天六个新社投入生产以前遇到的第一件大事，就是生产投资问题。最初，各社社员都尽量报投资数目。村的党支部对这种现象很满意，认为不会出现什么问题了。但问题就在这时出现了。各个社的领导骨干自报投资以后，普遍担心贫农报上拿不起。有的富裕中农对贫农说：“这回就看你们是不是积极要求入社了！”甚至有个别的社给贫农估家底。于是各社的贫农都尽自己的最大努力投了资，有的把自己烧火的秫秸和准备的口粮都投到社里来了，有的卖猪投齐了资。可是一些富裕中农不仅投资投在最后，而且大部分还没投齐。
    “这是什么问题呢？”党支部召开支部委员会进行了讨论。支部委员们认清了这是排斥贫农的现象。可是去年合作化规划过程中，大家觉得曾经注意了依靠贫农的问题，经过规划后，事实上贫农也入社了，支部委员们便觉得在社里排斥贫农的问题不会再有了，只有再建社、扩社时才会出现排斥贫农的现象。在区委的帮助下，支委会上对这种错误思想进行了批判，认识到全面规划只是党有计划地领导合作化运动的开始，还必须在社内经常地坚持贯彻党的阶级政策。
    党支部分析了在投资问题上排斥贫农的原因是中农怕贫农“揩油”。他们担心贫农“揩油”的原因又是什么呢？党支部研究的结果，发现有的社车马农具租价评得不合理，生产资料作价入社的社也没有规定几年把款还齐。根据这种情况，党支部向党员和各社社员进行了贫农同中农“合则两利，离则两伤”互相团结办好社的教育，说明在投资上排斥贫农是不对的，生产资料不确定合理代价让中农吃亏也是不对的。支部委员还分别深入到各社具体帮助解决了贫农和中农团结的问题。
    去年建社时，被排斥在社外的贫农文治民，规划时被安插到永丰社，遭到了南庆福等富裕中农的歧视。南庆福等经常当着文治民等后入社的贫农嘀咕：你们入社倒合适，家底子别人都给你们打下了。党支部就派人到这个社研究了南庆福等所以要排斥贫农的原因，主要是他有一台胶轮车入社没作价。于是帮助这个社先研究确定了车价和偿还年限，随后向南庆福讲入社的农民都是一样劳动，生产资料又给合理代价，谁也不会揩谁的油，并说明贫农同中农团结办好社的重要性。南庆福感到自己过去做的不对了；贫农文治民也不觉得理屈了，干活劲头很高。
    文连山领导的农业生产合作社的中农李国才，总担心贫困户“啃”自己，他看见贫困户王国斌的柴禾没有了，就对社主任说：“你看他柴禾垛都没有了，还不得咱们给呀，不如早点把他‘起’出去算了！”听了这些话，党支部书记于文化就找他谈话，向他说：“你过去也是个受苦的人，租地主几垧地年年闹不上吃穿，你该记得怕地主要账，过年那天晚上往外跑，连年都过不好；如今你生活好了，可是还有些贫农因为生产有困难过得还不好，参加社不正是要彻底摆脱那个穷根吗？再说社内生产资料有合理代价，你怎么能吃着亏呢？”李国才难过得掉泪了，说自己“好了疮疤忘了疼”。
    解决了这些问题。党支部还注意了从经济上帮助贫农解决困难，更加促进了贫农同中农的团结。常太领导的农业生产合作社，禁止了有八匹马的新富农刘景山参加社以后，全社的马少了一半，每个畜力从平均负担七垧多地提高到十垧多地。可是，由于国家银行和信用合作社贷给了两匹马和一部分草料，社领导骨干又动员四户贫农买进了四匹马，解决了耕畜问题，春耕夏锄搞得都很好。这样一来贫农更加相信在党的领导下，办社没有克服不了的困难；中农也说“做梦也没想到这么个穷社办得这样好”，打算秋后退社的中农李凤贵也不退社了。
    由于党支部在合作化规划以后进一步贯彻了阶级政策，一年来希勤村的阶级力量的对比有了很大的变化。去年建社的时候，是争富农，富农入社“拿把”，中农犹豫动摇，贫农被排斥。今年的情况恰恰相反，贫农成为办社骨干，中农靠拢了贫农也积极办社，这样就把富农孤立了。有些富农“托人说情”“探风”，几次表示“要求”入社都被拒绝了。地主更不用说，在贫农面前常是“献殷勤”“表示决心”要入社，贫农微笑着说：你在社外老老实实地干吧，多?叫你入社你再入！
    希勤村经过合作化全面规划，虽然把骨干力量调配开了，但是八个社中懂得怎样领导社的也只有八个人，而且绝大部分还都是头一次领导社。因此，党支部接受了别的地方的经验，确定以老社永丰农业生产合作社为重点建立互助合作网。在春耕的时候，党支部根据各社活计乱、管理委员摸不上头插不上手的情况，在永丰社研究并制定了社的季度计划和小段计划，实行了分级包工的办法，管理委员也分了工。然后通过互助合作网召集各社管理委员会议，介绍了永丰社的作法，又加党支部委员分头到各社进行帮助，各社在春耕中都比较有计划地安排了生产，社的委员都反映“摸上头了”。到夏锄时各社又都觉得摸不上头了，各社主任普遍反映：活多忙不过来。党支部到永丰社进行研究后，决定发动社员来讨论制定本社夏锄生产计划，然后发动竞赛鼓舞社员的劳动热情。结果提高了劳动效率。就是这样经过在实际生产中的锻炼，社员对社的事逐渐“入门了”。到挂锄为止，仅仅八、九个月的期间，全村三十二名党员中，已经有二十二名可以独立领导社了，加上学会办社的青年团员和群众中的积极分子，各社足有五、六名能处理社内一般事务的骨干了。各社都反映：办社已不是几个人操心的事，大家都动手了。
    春季各社投入生产以后，党支部感到应当充分发挥农业合作社的优越性，于是学习了外村生产规划的经验，各个社都实行了生产规划。往年，村领导上最搔头的一件事就是村里的四十多垧公有地没人种，年年春耕时都得往外推。可是今年春天全村进行生产规划时，各个社都抢着要，后来党支部专门召开会议进行合理分配才解决了问题。不仅如此，在春耕时各社还挤出力量开了两垧荒地。现在来看，各社都能超额完成生产规划时所提出的措施和要求。原来计划每套新式农具播种四十五垧地，结果由于各社、组联合使用“歇人歇马不歇机器”，平均每套新式农具播种了五十多垧地。据估计，今年用新式农具种的一百五十二垧小麦、高粱、大豆，比用旧式农具种的可增产八万五千多斤粮食。全村上粪面积达到了总耕地面积的百分之九十五，超过计划百分之五。玉米播种面积也扩大了。以现在的情况来估计，全村玉米的播种面积虽仅占全村粮食作物播种面积的三分之一，而产量却超过全村粮食总产量的二分之一。由于各社生产好，加上雨水调和，今年两个老社的社员收入能比去年提高百分之三十以上，六个新社的社员收入可比在互助组时提高百分之五十多，比现在社外互助组的收入高百分之二十到三十。互助组农民在农业合作社的带动下，搞好了生产，组员收入也可比去年增加百分之三十左右。
    由于全村农业生产合作社生产好收入增多，加上四个互助组在去年规划时搭配得合适，领导骨干分开了，又在互助合作网内分别同合作社挂上了钩，现在，互助组员入社的积极性日益高涨，全村在社外的八十一户农民中已经有五十五户要求入社了。
    村党支部在农民中的威信也越来越高了。现在村内各个重大事情的处理，农民都要看看党支部的态度，说“看支部叫怎样办，就怎样办”。农民群众对党的这种高度信任，使村里的党员和支部委员更加感到自己的责任重大和光荣。党支部书记于文化说：“今后工作不同以前了，更需要全面规划和加强领导了。”（原载“黑龙江日报”）
