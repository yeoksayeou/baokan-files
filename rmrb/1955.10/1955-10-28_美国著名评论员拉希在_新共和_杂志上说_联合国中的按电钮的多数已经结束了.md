Xinhua News Agency, Washington: "The 'button-pushing majority' in the UN is over" – this is the title of an article by prominent American commentator James Reston commenting on the current situation of the United States in the United Nations General Assembly. The article was published in the October 24th issue of "The New Republic" magazine.

The article states: "The leadership that the United States once possessed, which was able to gather a majority in the United Nations General Assembly on any issue it considered important, has now suffered some unspeakable defeats in this session of the Assembly."

Reston said that the first defeat was on the Algerian issue, in which the United States incurred extreme dissatisfaction. The majority of anti-colonialist countries condemned the United States for voting in favor of France.

Reston continued that the second defeat suffered by the United States was that, after the Algerian issue, "the American delegation unwittingly tried to push through a comprehensive movement to elect the Philippines to the Security Council seat originally allocated to Eastern Europe. American spokesman Lodge said that our candidate country 'has a good chance of being elected in the first vote.' However, Western European countries, which did not want to give this seat to Asian countries, stood with the Soviet bloc, and Asian countries also opposed electing the Philippines because they were unwilling to use this method to obtain the increased representation they desired."

Reston said that the third defeat "is likely brewing in the discussion on the peaceful uses of atomic energy." On this issue, "the American attempt to prevent the United Nations from interfering in the proposed international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy has aroused widespread opposition, especially from underdeveloped countries... Underdeveloped countries believe that the organizational draft proposed by the United States is a plan to control their atomic development rather than promote it. They want to strive for the United Nations General Assembly to have a decisive say in this agency because they believe that this will provide some guarantees to prevent manipulation by major powers."

Reston pointed out that the Soviet Union's influence in the United Nations is growing, while "American leadership" is "losing its effectiveness." UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld came out to intervene in the discussion on the issue of national self-determination, "and as a result, he was condemned as a lackey of the colonial powers."

### 美国著名评论员拉希在“新共和”杂志上说  联合国中的按电钮的多数已经结束了

    美国著名评论员拉希在“新共和”杂志上说
    联合国中的按电钮的多数已经结束了
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：“联合国中的按电钮的多数已经结束了”——这是美国著名评论员约瑟夫·拉希所写的评论美国目前在联合国大会处境的一篇文章的标题，这篇文章刊载在十月二十四日一期的“新共和”杂志上。
    这篇文章说：“过去美国所掌握的领导权一向能够在联合国大会中在它认为重要的任何问题上纠合一个大多数。现在，在本届大会上，它已经遭到了某些令人吓得连话都讲不出来的失败”。
    拉希说，第一个失败是在阿尔及利亚问题上，美国在这个问题中招致了极度不满。反殖民主义的大多数国家抨击美国投票支持法国。
    拉希接着说，美国遭到的第二个失败是，在阿尔及利亚问题以后，“美国代表团毫没有发觉地要求推动一个全面运动来选举菲律宾取得原来分配给东欧的安全理事会席位。美国发言人洛奇说，我们的候选国‘很有希望在第一次投票中获选’。但是，不希望把这个席位交给亚洲国家的西欧国家却与苏联集团站在一起，而亚洲国家也反对选菲律宾，其理由是他们不愿用这种方法来得到他们希望增加的代表权。”
    拉希说，第三个失败“很可能正在关于和平利用原子能问题的讨论中酝酿。”在这个问题上“美国企图不让联合国干涉拟议中的和平利用原子能国际机构，这一企图已经引起了广泛的反对，特别是落后国家的反对。……落后国家认为美国所提的组织草案是一个控制它们的原子发展而不是促进它们的原子发展的计划。它们所以想力求联合国大会对这个机构有一种决定性的发言权，是因为它们认为这样就会有某些保证来防止大国的操纵。”
    拉希指出，苏联在联合国里的影响在增长，而“美国的领导”在“失去作用”。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德出来干涉关于民族自决问题的讨论，“结果被人家谴责他是殖民国家的一名走卒”。
