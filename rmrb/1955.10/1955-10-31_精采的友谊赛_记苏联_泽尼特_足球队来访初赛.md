    A Wonderful Friendly Match
    ——A Record of the Preliminary Match of the Soviet "Zenit" Football Team's Visit
  　Li Ping
    Yesterday afternoon (October 30th), the Leningrad "Zenit" football team of the Soviet Union played their first friendly match in China against the Central Institute of Physical Education and the First Machine Football Joint Team. The football players of the two brotherly countries performed excellently on the field. After ninety minutes of intense competition, the score was tied, two to two.
    The Leningrad "Zenit" football team is one of the famous football teams in the Soviet Union. This team has achieved considerable success in recent international competitions. Their performance on the field yesterday showed their high level of technical skill.
    After the start of the match, the Joint Team, playing against the wind, launched an offensive first. Forwards Shi Wanchun, Sun Fucheng, and Han Wensong used triangular short passes to bring the ball into the "Zenit" team's defensive zone. After several interceptions, the ball was still controlled by the Joint Team; left-winger Han Wensong received the ball near the baseline and crossed it, and right inside forward Jin Longhu switched positions and shot from the center of the field, 18 meters out, but missed. After this, the "Zenit" team organized an attack. The "Zenit" team's forward line had high speed and very skilled individual basic techniques, so they quickly pressed the ball into the Joint Team's territory with just a few passes. Even Cong Anqing, the Joint Team's most astute midfielder, found it difficult to stop right-winger Ivanov and center forward Kravetz. However, because the Joint Team's forward line quickly retreated to strengthen the defense, the "Zenit" team's two pincer movements failed to achieve anything. At this time, the strengths of both sides were clearly visible to everyone. All the "Zenit" team members not only had good basic skills – passing, stopping, and dribbling were all done perfectly – but also had high speed, close cooperation, and strong attacking spirit; although the Joint Team's basic skills were slightly weaker, their cooperation and fighting will were not inferior.
    Fifteen minutes after the start of the match, "Zenit" team's right inside forward, Teniagin, dribbled the ball rapidly along the sideline. Joint Team's center back, Wang Defa, rushed out to intercept but was bypassed by Teniagin. Just as Teniagin was about to cross the ball to the left winger rushing to the goal, Joint Team's defender Li Changping caught up and kicked the ball out of bounds. The corner kick was taken, and the "Zenit" team's forwards had formed a horseshoe shape around the Joint Team's penalty area. Kravetz headed the ball towards the goal, but it was hooked out of the penalty area white line by Wang Defa, but the ball was blown back to the left side of the penalty area by the wind. Left winger Denisov saw it accurately and volleyed the ball into the net. The audience gave warm applause to the "Zenit" team's fierce offensive and powerful shooting skills.
    The Joint Team conceded a goal first, but their morale was not diminished. The defense tightened their marking even more, and the defensive line formed by the center back and midfielders became more solid. Eight minutes after the kickoff, the Joint Team's five forwards, escorted by the midfielders, launched a blitz from the right side. First, right-winger Li Chaogui dribbled the ball rapidly forward. When he saw the opposing midfielder Karpov rushing to intercept, he immediately passed it to center forward Shi Wanchun, who was supporting him slightly behind. Shi Wanchun dodged center back Samarin and lobbed the ball to Jin Longhu, who was cutting in with all his might; Jin Longhu skillfully dribbled it a few steps, and "Zenit" team's experienced goalkeeper Leonid rushed out to block the opponent's shooting angle. Jin Longhu took the opportunity to pass the ball to the center, and then powerfully kicked the ball from 12 meters to the right of the goal. Leonid was unable to save it, and the ball flew into the bottom of the net from the left corner. The score on the field was one to one, and more than 20,000 spectators congratulated the Joint Team on their successful counterattack.
    After the tie, both sides wanted to win, and the competition on the field became more intense. Before the end of the first half, neither side was able to score.
    The second half began, and the advantage of the attack was still in the hands of the "Zenit" team. Although they were playing against the wind, they repeatedly approached the Joint Team's goal by using accurate triangular low passes. The cross-switching of positions between the wingers was also very flexible and appropriate. As a result, the Joint Team's defense line had loopholes three times. Due to timely covering, several long-range shots by the "Zenit" team failed to break through the net. After about ten minutes, a melee broke out in front of the Joint Team's goal. The "Zenit" team once again approached the Joint Team's goal with a horseshoe-shaped offensive. Left inside forward Bondarenko received the ball and kicked it hard, but it was blocked by Wang Defa. Ivanov hooked the ball back and kicked it into the goal. The score on the field was two to one, and the "Zenit" team took the lead again. In order to increase the attacking power, the Joint Team replaced Li Chaogui with Sun Qiubo. At this time, the forward line was basically retreating to assist in defense. In the thirty-seventh minute, the Joint Team organized a clever attack. Joint Team's left midfielder Wang Liwei received the ball in front of the "Zenit" team's goal and took a powerful long-range shot. Leonid's standing position was slightly to the left, and the ball flew into the net from the right corner. This goal was kicked unexpectedly, causing a burst of cheers from the stands. After the second tie, both sides went all out to win the final victory. The Joint Team's attacking power gradually became stronger, and Han Wensong and Shi Wanchun were very active in the "Zenit" team's defensive zone, but their match experience was not as good as that of the "Zenit" team, so offside fouls often occurred. The "Zenit" team also had many clever collaborations, but the final shot was either wide or bravely intercepted by the Joint Team. The referee's long whistle ended the match, and the result was a two-to-two draw.
    From this match, it can be seen that the "Zenit" team's many advantages in comprehensive attack and comprehensive defense were most prominent. The connection between the forwards and defenders was very close, and there were very few mispasses and excessive dribbling, so they played very lightly. What was especially touching was that when they were fighting for the ball in the goal area, they never used their feet when it might hurt our athletes. This noble sportsmanship was warmly praised by more than 20,000 spectators. (Attached picture)

    精采的友谊赛 
    ——记苏联“泽尼特”足球队来访初赛
  　李平
    苏联列宁格勒“泽尼特”足球队，昨天（十月三十日）下午，同我国中央体育学院和第一机械足球联合队作了来华访问第一场友谊比赛。两个兄弟国家的足球运动员，在球场上表演得十分出色。九十分钟激烈比赛结果，二比二，打成平局。
    列宁格勒“泽尼特”足球队是苏联著名的足球队之一。这个队在近年来的国际比赛中，曾获得相当战绩。他们昨天在运动场上的表演，显示了他们具有的高度技术水平。
    球赛开始后，联队逆风首先发动攻势，前锋史万春、孙福成、韩文松用三角短传把球带进“泽尼特”队防区，几经截夺，球仍被联队控制；左翼韩文松在近底线处得球中传，右内锋金龙湖换位在门前正中十八公尺外试射偏出。这以后，“泽尼特”队组织进攻。“泽尼特”队锋线速度很高，个人基本技术又很熟练，所以不几传即将球压进联队腹地。联队判断能力最强的前卫丛安庆也难于阻挡右翼伊凡诺夫和中锋克拉维茨。但由于联队锋线迅速后退加强防守，“泽尼特”队两次钳形楔入都没有建功。这时候，双方优点都已清楚地显现在人们眼前。“泽尼特”队所有队员，不仅基本技术好——传球、停球、带球都能作到恰到好处，而且速度高，合作紧密，攻坚锐气旺盛；联队基本技术虽然稍差一些，但合作和战斗意志也不差。
    开赛后第十五分钟，“泽尼特”队右内锋捷尼亚根，带球沿边线迅猛推进，联队中卫王德发奔出拦截被捷尼亚根闪过。捷尼亚根正想传中给左边锋线冲门，联队后卫李长平赶上一脚把球踢出底线。角球开出，“泽尼特”队前锋已成马蹄形围住联队禁区，克拉维茨头球攻门，被王德发倒钩出禁区白线，但球又被风送回禁区左侧，左翼杰尼索夫看得准确，凌空一脚射球进网。全场观众对“泽尼特”队的猛烈攻势和猛狠的射门技术，报以热烈掌声。
    联队先输一分，但斗志并不稍馁，卫线紧逼盯人更加严密，中卫和前卫间组成的防线也更稳固。在开球后八分钟，联队五锋得前卫护送，从右侧发动闪击。先是右翼李朝贵带球急进，当他看见对方前卫卡尔波夫冲来截球时，立即拨送给稍靠后策应的中锋史万春。史万春闪过中卫萨马林，挑高球传给并力切进的金龙湖；金龙湖巧妙地略带几步，“泽尼特”队富有经验的守门员列昂尼德冲出封锁对方射门角度，金龙湖趁势中拨，在距门右侧十二公尺处猛踢一脚，列昂尼德扑救不及，球从左角飞入网底。场上记录一比一，两万多观众都为联队成功的反击祝贺。
    打成平手后两方都想争取胜利，球场上的竞争更加激烈。在上半时终场前，双方都无法射球进网。
    下半时开始，进攻的优势仍被“泽尼特”队掌握，他们虽然处在逆风地位，但他们运用准确的三角低传屡次逼近联队门前，锋翼之间的交叉换位也十分灵活、适度，这样，就使联队卫线三度发生漏洞，由于补位及时，“泽尼特”队几次远射都未破网。十分钟左右，联队门前一片混战，“泽尼特”队又一次以马蹄形攻势迫近联队大门，左内锋邦达连科得球猛踢，被王德发挡出，伊凡诺夫顺势钩回一脚踢进门去。场上记录二比一，“泽尼特”队再次领先。为了增加攻击力量，联队以孙秋波替换李朝贵，这时锋线基本上是回防助守。到第三十七分钟，联队组织了一次巧妙的进攻，联合队左前卫王立惟在“泽尼特”队门前得球强劲远射，列昂尼德站立方位偏左，球从右角飞进网底。这个球踢得出其不意，使看台上腾起一片喝采声。第二次打成平手后，两方更全力争取最后胜利，联队攻击力量逐渐显现强大，韩文松、史万春在“泽尼特”队防区十分活跃，但比赛经验到底不如“泽尼特”队，因此，常发生越位犯规。“泽尼特”队也有多次巧妙合作，却在临门时一脚偏出或被联队奋勇截出。裁判员一声长哨，结束了这场比赛，结果是二比二平局。
    从这场比赛中，可以看到“泽尼特”队在全面进攻和全面防守上的许多优点表现得最为突出，锋卫之间的联系十分紧密，误传和过多的盘带是很少的，所以他们打得特别轻巧；而尤其感人的是他们在门区争球时，当可能伤害我国运动员的情况下，他们从不出脚。这种高尚运动道德，受到了两万多观众的热烈赞扬。（附图片）
