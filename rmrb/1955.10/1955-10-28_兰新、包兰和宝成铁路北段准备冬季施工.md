Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, and the northern section of Baoji-Chengdu Railway are stepping up preparations for this year's large-scale winter construction. This winter, the earthwork for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang and Baotou-Lanzhou railways amounts to more than 3.86 million cubic meters, and the concrete pouring for bridges, culverts, and tunnels amounts to more than 46,000 cubic meters. The additional project of extending the track-laying westward from Zhangye for more than 100 kilometers on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is also preparing for winter construction. The number of construction sites planned for winter construction on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has increased several times compared to last year.

The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which is undertaking the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang and Baotou-Lanzhou railways, has already drafted a winter construction plan. A large number of cold-proof materials needed for winter construction and protective equipment needed for workers' work have been fully prepared. Cold-proof sheds are being built on the construction sites. Various construction sites have begun training engineering and technical personnel to improve the labor efficiency of winter construction. All transportation vehicles used in winter construction will also be equipped with steam preheating equipment to ensure the normal transportation of locomotives. On various construction sites north and south of the Qinling Mountains on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, temporary buildings such as workers' sheds, warm sheds, and cold-proof doors are now being renovated. Most of the sand and gravel needed for the winter lining of the Qinling Great Tunnel have been prepared. In order to supply coal, wheat straw, bamboo poles and other materials needed for winter construction, the Sixth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which is undertaking the construction of the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, has contacted or signed contracts with local relevant supply units. The employees of various construction units have also begun to study winter construction rules and related materials.

    兰新、包兰和宝成铁路北段准备冬季施工
    兰新铁路、包兰铁路和宝成铁路北段正在加紧准备今年规模较大的冬季施工。今年兰新和包兰路冬季施工的路基土方工程有三百八十六万多方，桥涵隧道等灌注混凝土工程也有四万六千多方。兰新铁路今年追加的向张掖以西继续铺轨一百多公里的工程，也正在准备冬季施工。宝成路北段计划冬季施工的工点比去年增加了好几倍。
    承建兰新和包兰铁路的铁道部第一工程局已经拟出了冬季施工计划。冬季施工所需要的大量防寒材料和工人工作所需要的保护用品都已经充分准备妥当。工地上已经在搭盖防寒棚。各个工地已经开始训练工程技术人员，以提高冬季施工的劳动效率。冬季施工中所用的运输车辆也将全部安装蒸汽预热设备，以保证机车的正常运输。宝成路北段在秦岭南北的各个工地上，现在也正在整修工棚，盖暖棚、防寒门等临时建筑。秦岭大隧道冬季衬砌需用的沙石大部分已经准备齐全。为了供应冬季施工需用的煤炭、麦草、竹竿等物资，承建宝成路北段的铁道部第六工程局已经和当地各有关供应单位取得联系或签订了合同。各施工单位的职工也已经开始学习冬季施工规则和有关资料。
