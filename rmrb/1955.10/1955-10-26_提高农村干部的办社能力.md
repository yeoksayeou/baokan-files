    Improving the Ability of Rural Cadres to Run Cooperatives
    Ren Tingrui, Zhang Jianfeng
    Since 1953, Lin County, Shanxi Province, has begun experimenting with agricultural producers' cooperatives. At present, it has developed to 1,154 cooperatives, with 40,224 member households, accounting for 57 percent of the total number of households. However, under the new situation of great development of cooperation, the contradiction that the leading force cannot keep up with the development of the movement is becoming increasingly prominent. In 1953, one or several county and district cadres specializing in running cooperatives were stationed in one cooperative. In 1954, the number of cooperatives had increased sixfold, and it had become difficult to universally send cadres to be stationed in cooperatives, but it was still possible to send one cadre to every two cooperatives, or two cadres to every three cooperatives to run the cooperatives. However, since the autumn of 1954, the situation has changed drastically, and the original cadre force capable of running cooperatives has been far from meeting the needs of the great development of cooperatives. Among the 33 county-level leading cadres in the county, only 13 were familiar with the policies of running cooperatives, and among the 359 general county and district cadres, only 101 could run cooperatives. Many cadres were "outsiders" to running cooperatives, and some cadres were afraid that cooperative cadres would ask them to solve problems of the cooperative, so they did not dare to enter the cooperative. On the other hand, the township branches at that time were not yet able to fully shoulder the task of running cooperatives. Among the 1,008 main cadres of township branches in the county, only 334 had initially learned how to run cooperatives.
    This situation presented the county party committee with an important task: it must quickly cultivate and improve the ability of rural work cadres to run cooperatives. In the past year, the Lin County Party Committee has made great efforts in this regard. At present, 323 county and district cadres and 710 township cadres in the county have learned how to run cooperatives. Due to the increase in leadership, the 775 cooperatives established before this spring in the county have basically been consolidated. Among them, 624 cooperatives increased production by 10 to 20 percent compared with farmers outside the cooperatives, 112 cooperatives had the same output as farmers outside the cooperatives, and only 39 cooperatives had lower output than farmers outside the cooperatives. Facts have proved that the cooperative movement has not only improved the socialist consciousness of the masses, but also cultivated and trained a group of cadres in actual work.
    In terms of cultivating cadres, in addition to strengthening the guidance, supervision, and inspection of cadres' learning in ordinary times, the Lin County Party Committee particularly emphasized the cultivation and training of cadres in actual work. To this end, after explaining the policies to the cadres, the county party committee sent a large number of cadres to the grassroots level to "bump" and "delve into" the issues; after a period of time, they were transferred back for concentrated training. Members of the county party committee and general county and district cadres were assigned to contract for areas, going deep into the cooperatives to guide work on the one hand and learn in practice on the other. In actual work, the method of experienced hands leading inexperienced hands was also adopted to cultivate cadres. Therefore, some cadres who "avoided cooperatives" felt that they had a "master" to help them, so they dared to boldly go deep into and solve the problems of the cooperatives. Some cadres encountered specific problems in the initial stage of going down, and were "bumped" back. At this time, they would consult with experienced hands, and then go down to guide the running of the cooperatives. The county and district leading organs also regularly convened resident cooperative cadres to report, check their work, and specifically help them learn the work methods of leading the running of cooperatives. In this way, learning and running at the same time, with more problems "bumped" into, the cadres improved faster, and over time, they gained more experience in running cooperatives, gradually changing from inexperienced hands to experienced hands. For example, when Yang Yuzhi, a cadre of the rural work team, was working in the Nianwu Village Cooperative, the members asked him to solve some specific problems, but he was not very familiar with running cooperatives, and the problems were not solved very reasonably, so the members were not satisfied. When the county party committee learned about this, it specifically explained the method to him. When he went down to help the cooperative solve the problem for the second time, he did a very good job, and the cooperative cadres were satisfied. Wang Yingchang, a district cadre, originally did not know how to run cooperatives. The county party committee sent him to help a cooperative with a chaotic situation. He did not dare to go. Later, Wang Xing, the leader of the work team, took him there, and the two of them jointly solved the specific problems of the cooperative. He also learned some methods from it, and gradually became a cadre who could independently lead the running of cooperatives.
    In order to meet the requirements of the new situation, the county and district leading organs handed over the responsibility of running cooperatives to the township branches, changing the township cadres' thinking of simply relying on county and district cadres to run cooperatives, thereby enhancing the township cadres' sense of responsibility. Except for eleven large cooperatives and three types of cooperatives that have fixed county and district cadres to help lead, the general cooperatives mainly rely on township cadres to "contract" and be responsible. Precisely because they boldly let the rural branches run the cooperatives, a large number of backbones for running cooperatives have grown up from the movement. At present, there are more than 1,000 township cadres in the county who can independently run cooperatives.
    In order to improve the ability of cadres to run cooperatives, the county party committee held seven meetings to discuss mutual aid and cooperation work in one year, with county, district, and township cadres participating each time. Through such meetings, work was summarized, experiences were exchanged, and cadres were educated. After the exercise of actual work, coupled with these few centralized trainings, many cadres were able to more systematically understand the principles, policies, and methods of running cooperatives, shortening the process from inexperienced hands to experienced hands. The cadres generally reflected: "The more training, the clearer the principles and methods, and each training clarifies them once. After the training, our hearts are bright and our courage is strengthened." In addition, according to the progress of the work, the county party committee also convened symposiums of cadres running cooperatives in separate areas and sections, summarizing and exchanging experiences in running cooperatives at any time, so that the cadres' thinking became clear in dealing with some small and specific problems.
    Cooperative networks have played a great role in improving the ability of grassroots cadres to run cooperatives. Lin County has a total of 115 cooperative networks. By exchanging experiences through the cooperative networks, not only were the actual problems in production of each cooperative solved in a timely manner, but also the abilities of the cadres were improved. In particular, the central cooperatives that were focused on guiding by the main cadres of the county, district, and township were one step ahead in their work. By timely disseminating the experience of these advanced cooperatives through the cooperative networks, the knowledge and methods of running cooperatives of the grassroots cadres could be greatly enriched, so as to guide the work of general cooperatives with foresight. Through 117 central cooperatives, 658 general cooperatives have been driven throughout the county. In the past year, eight cooperatives in Seshang Township have cultivated 18 backbones for running cooperatives through the cooperative network. Since their establishment last year, the Zhoujiagou and Wangjiazhuang cooperatives in this township have been relying on the cooperative network to cultivate cadres and improve the operation and management of the cooperatives, and as a result, both have increased production.

    提高农村干部的办社能力
    任廷瑞　张剑锋
    山西省临县从一九五三年开始试办农业生产合作社，到目前已发展到一千一百五十四个社，入社农户达到四万零二百二十四户，占总农户的百分之五十七。但是在合作化大发展的新形势下，领导力量跟不上运动发展进度的矛盾越来越突出了。一九五三年，一个社里驻有一个或几个专门办社的县、区干部，一九五四年合作社的数目已增加了六倍，普遍派干部驻社已开始发生困难，但还可以每两个社派一个干部，或者每三社派两个干部去办社；可是从一九五四年秋天以后，情况大变，原有的能够办社的干部力量已经远不能适应合作社大发展的需要了。全县三十三个县级领导干部中，熟悉办社政策的只有十三个人，三百五十九个一般县、区干部中，会办社的只有一百零一个人。许多干部对办社是“门外汉”，有些干部怕合作社干部要求解决社的问题，不敢进合作社的门。另一方面，当时的乡支部也还不能完全担负起办社的任务。全县有一千零八个乡支部的主要干部，初步学会办社的仅有三百三十四人。
    这种情况给县委提出了一个重要任务：必须迅速培养和提高农村工作干部的办社能力。一年来，临县县委在这方面是作了很大努力的。目前全县已有三百二十三个县、区干部、七百一十个乡干部学会了办社。由于领导力量的增强，全县今年春天以前建立的七百七十五个合作社基本上巩固下来了，其中有六百二十四个社比社外农民增产百分之十到二十，有一百一十二个社的产量和社外农民的产量相等，只有三十九个社的产量比社外农民的产量减少。事实证明，合作化运动不仅提高了群众的社会主义觉悟，而且在实际工作中培养和锻炼了一批干部。
    在培养干部方面，临县县委除平时加强对干部学习的指导、督促和检查外，特别重视干部在实际工作中培养和锻炼。为此，县委在向干部交代政策以后，便把大批干部派到下面去“碰”、去“钻”；过一时期后，再调回来加以集中训练。县委委员，一般县、区干部都分工包片，深入到合作社中去一面指导工作，一面在实际中学习。在实际工作中还采取了熟手带生手的办法，来培养干部，因此，某些“躲社”的干部，感到有“师傅”帮助他，也就敢于大胆深入进去，解决合作社的问题了。有些干部在下去的初期遇上具体问题，又被“碰”回来，这时他就向熟手领教，然后再下去指导办社。县、区领导机关并且定期召集驻社干部汇报，检查他们的工作，具体帮助他们学会领导办社的工作方法。这样，边学边办，“碰”的问题多，干部提高得也快，日积月累，办社经验也多了，逐渐由生手变成熟手。如下乡工作组的干部杨玉芝在碾坞村合作社工作的时候，社员要求他给解决一些具体问题，但是他对办社还不大熟悉，对问题解决得不大合理，社员不满意；县委知道了，就向他具体地交代了办法，当他第二次下去帮助合作社解决问题的时候就做得很好，合作社的干部感到满意。区干部王映昌原来不会办社，县委派他去帮助一个情况混乱的合作社，他不敢去，后来工作组组长王兴带他前去，两个人共同解决了合作社的具体问题，他也从中学会了一些办法，以后就逐渐变成了能够单独领导办社的干部。
    为了适应新形势的要求，县、区领导机关把办社责任交给了乡支部，改变了乡干部单纯依靠县、区干部办社的思想，从而使乡干部提高了责任心。全县除十一个大社和三类社有固定的县、区干部帮助领导外，一般的社主要依靠乡干部“包干”负责。正由于大胆放手让农村支部去办社，大批的办社骨干就从运动中成长起来，目前全县已有一千多个乡干部可以单独办社。
    为了提高干部的办社能力，县委在一年中召开了七次讨论互助合作工作的会议，每次都有县、区、乡干部参加。通过这样的会议，总结工作，交流经验，教育干部。经过实际工作的锻炼，再加上这样几次集中训练，使得许多干部能够比较系统地领会办社的方针、政策和办法，缩短由生手到熟手的过程。干部普遍反映：“越训练，方针、办法越明确，训练一次明确一次，经过训练，心亮了，胆子壮了。”此外，县委根据工作进度，又分区分段召开了办社干部座谈会，随时总结、交流办社经验，使干部在处理一些细小的具体问题上，思想也明确起来。
    在提高基层干部办社能力方面，合作网发挥了很大的作用。临县共有一百一十五个合作网，通过合作网交流经验，既及时解决了各个社生产上的实际问题，又提高了干部能力。特别是县、区、乡的主要干部重点指导的中心社，工作都走在前面一步，通过合作网及时传播这些先进社的经验，就能大大充实基层干部的办社知识和办法，从而做到有预见地指导一般合作社的工作。全县通过一百一十七个中心社带动了六百五十八个一般社。塞上乡有八个社一年来通过合作网培养了十八个办社骨干。这个乡的周家沟和王家庄的合作社，从去年建立时起，一直是依靠合作网培养干部和改进合作社的经营管理，结果都增加了生产。
