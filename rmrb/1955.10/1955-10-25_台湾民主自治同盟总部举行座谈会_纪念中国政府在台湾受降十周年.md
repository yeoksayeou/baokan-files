Xinhua News Agency, October 24th: The headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League held a symposium for league members in Beijing on the 23rd to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Chinese government accepting surrender in Taiwan. The meeting was presided over by Xie Xuehong, Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. Vice Chairman Li Chunqing delivered a report at the meeting.

Attendees pointed out in their speeches: Ten years ago—on October 25, 1945, after Chen Yi, representing the Chinese government, accepted the surrender of Japanese representative Ando Rikichi in Taiwan, Taiwan was returned to China from then on. This ironclad fact proves that Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory, and the United States' forcible occupation and the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique absolutely cannot be allowed to continue.

Everyone unanimously expressed that they would work hard, actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland, and fight to the end to rescue the Taiwan compatriots living in dire straits. Those who participated in the symposium were full of strong confidence, believing that Taiwan must be liberated and Taiwan compatriots will surely return to the big family of the motherland.
