Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 8th. Indonesian Prime Minister Harahap stated on the 7th, while reporting the cabinet's policy program to the plenary session of the parliament, that the government believes it is necessary to fulfill the political principles stipulated during the Asian-African Conference and is considering further steps to implement the conference's resolutions.

Harahap said that the government will study the possibility of concluding treaties of friendship with more countries. Indonesia has already concluded treaties of friendship with Egypt, Syria, Pakistan, India, Burma, the Philippines, Thailand, and Afghanistan.

Harahap said, "Our relationship with the People's Republic of China will continue to be friendly."

Harahap also announced that Vice President Hatta will visit India, Burma, and Ceylon in October and November.

The Harahap cabinet's policy program includes seven points, including quickly organizing a new parliament, re-establishing the government's authority, resolving the army incidents, and striving to recover West Irian.

Harahap assured the parliament: "The cabinet will return its mandate on the day the new parliament begins its session." The Prime Minister said, "Therefore, the government requests that the parliament give it the opportunity to work until the new parliament begins to carry out its tasks."

After Harahap announced the policy program, Parliamentary Speaker Sadono announced that members of parliament could register by the 10th to speak in the general debate to be held during the first reading of the policy program. The first reading will begin on the morning of October 12th.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 9th. According to a report by the Indonesian News Agency on the 9th, Indonesian Minister of Information Makmur announced at a press conference on the 8th that political parties are now permitted to conduct campaign activities for the Constituent Assembly elections. The Constituent Assembly elections are scheduled to be held on December 15th of this year.

Makmur said that it was necessary to make this announcement clear because many electoral districts had written to inquire whether the government's order prohibiting campaign activities from September 25th onwards was still in effect, now that the parliamentary elections had been voted on.

According to the Indonesian Provisional Constitution, one member is elected to form the Constituent Assembly for every 150,000 citizens. According to a survey by the Indonesian Central Election Committee, there are a total of over 77.98 million Indonesian citizens, so the Constituent Assembly elections will elect 520 members. The task of the Constituent Assembly is to formulate the Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia and elect the President and Vice President of the Republic.

    印度尼西亚总理哈拉哈普发表施政纲领
    印度尼西亚各政党参加制宪议会选举竞选活动
    新华社雅加达八日电　印度尼西亚总理哈拉哈普七日在向国会全体会议报告内阁施政纲领时说，政府认为有必要履行在亚非会议期间所规定的政治原则，并且正在考虑为实现会议的决议而采取的进一步的步骤。
    哈拉哈普说，政府将研究同更多的国家缔结友好条约的可能性。印度尼西亚已经同埃及、叙利亚、巴基斯坦、印度、缅甸、菲律宾、泰国和阿富汗缔结了友好条约。
    哈拉哈普说：“我们和中华人民共和国的关系将继续保持友好。”
    哈拉哈普还宣布，副总统哈达将在十月和十一月间访问印度、缅甸和锡兰。
    哈拉哈普内阁的施政纲领包括从速组织新的国会、重新建立政府的权威和解决陆军事件、努力收复西伊里安等七点。
    哈拉哈普向国会保证说：“在新国会开始开会的那天，内阁就将交还它的委任状。”这位总理说：“因此，政府要求国会使它有机会工作到新国会开始执行它的任务时为止。”
    在哈拉哈普发表了施政纲领之后，国会议长沙多诺宣布，国会议员们可以在十日以前报名参加在施政纲领进行一读时举行的一般辩论中发言。一读将在十月十二日上午开始。
    新华社雅加达九日电　据印度尼西亚新闻社九日报道，印度尼西亚情报部长马克慕尔八日在记者招待会上宣布，现在已准许各政党进行参加制宪议会选举的竞选活动。制宪议会选举预定在今年十二月十五日举行。
    马克慕尔说，所以有必要明白宣布这件事，是因为有许多选区来信询问说，现在国会选举已经投了票，政府发布的关于从九月二十五日起禁止竞选活动的命令是否继续有效。
    根据印度尼西亚临时宪法，每十五万名公民中选出一名议员来组成制宪议会。据印度尼西亚中央选举委员会的调查，印度尼西亚公民共为七千七百九十八万多人，所以制宪议会选举将选出五百二十名议员。制宪议会的任务是制定印度尼西亚共和国的宪法并且选举共和国的总统和副总统。
