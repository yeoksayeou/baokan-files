Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 29th: According to TASS, the discussion of the draft budget of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which began in the Chamber of Deputies on the 21st, ended on the 27th.

    Italian Communist Party member Aricata stated why he proposed a motion suggesting that the parliament accept the invitation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to establish direct contact with the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in order to promote mutual understanding and friendship between Italy and the Soviet Union and to promote cultural exchange and economic ties.

    Italian Foreign Minister Martino suggested that the motion be passed. Thus, the motion was passed without a vote.

    Later, Italian Foreign Minister Martino made a speech at the meeting.

    On behalf of the Italian government, Martino expressed satisfaction with the Geneva Four-Power Summit and the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. He emphasized that now it is necessary to continue to move forward in the spirit of Geneva and guaranteed to do his best to promote the movement for lasting peace.

    However, Martino also praised the work of the North Atlantic Alliance, which has sharpened international tensions.

    Martino talked about relations with the People's Republic of China. He said that the Italian government has ordered the Italian Embassy in Switzerland to contact the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China and "to explain to him the Italian government's willingness to gradually normalize trade relations between the two countries." Martino said: Currently, the two sides are discussing the conditions and location for the first meeting of economic experts from both countries.

    Martino assured the Chamber of Deputies: "The government will do everything in its power to expand the scope of Italy's economic ties."

    When talking about the relationship between Italy and the Soviet Union, Martino believed that it was necessary to improve relations between the two countries.

    When talking about the issue of restoring German unification, Martino believed that "the Germans are the most qualified to speak on this issue." He also said: "The restoration of German unification cannot be achieved without a general European security agreement."

    When talking about the relationship between Austria and Italy, Martino said that Austria's permanent neutral status "arises from a requirement that the Italian government fully understands."

    Martino also talked about Italy's relations with Albania. He pointed out that the negotiations that Italy started with Albania not long ago are progressing smoothly. Preserving Albania's independence and integrity is in the interests of Italy and the West.

    The Italian Foreign Ministry budget draft was approved by 260 votes to 182.

    新华社二十九日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利下议院从二十一日开始的外交部预算草案的讨论，已经在二十七日结束。
    意大利共产党议员阿里卡塔申述了他为什么要提出这样一个议案，这个议案建议议会接受苏联最高苏维埃的邀请而同苏联最高苏维埃建立直接的联系，以便促进意大利和苏联的互相谅解和友谊以及促进文化交流和经济往来。
    意大利外交部长马蒂诺建议通过这个议案。于是，这个议案不用表决就通过了。
    后来，意大利外交部长马蒂诺在会上发了言。
    马蒂诺代表意大利政府，对日内瓦四国政府首脑会议和苏联同德意志联邦共和国的谈判表示满意。他强调现在应当本着日内瓦精神继续前进，并且保证要竭力推进建立持久和平的运动。
    但是，马蒂诺又称赞使国际紧张局势尖锐化的北大西洋联盟的工作。
    马蒂诺谈到同中华人民共和国的关系。他说，意大利政府已经命令意大利驻瑞士使馆同中华人民共和国大使接触，并且“向他说明意大利政府愿意逐步使两国的贸易关系正常化”。马蒂诺说：现在，双方正在商讨两国经济专家第一次会晤的条件和地点。
    马蒂诺向下院保证说：“政府将竭尽一切力量争取扩大意大利经济联系的范围。”
    马蒂诺在谈到意大利和苏联之间的关系时，认为有必要改进两国的关系。
    马蒂诺谈到恢复德国统一的问题时，认为“在这个问题上最有资格发言的首先是德国人”。他并且说：“恢复德国的统一离开总的欧洲安全协定是不可能达到的。”
    马蒂诺在谈到奥地利同意大利的关系时说，奥地利永久中立的地位“产生于一种要求，这种要求是意大利政府方面充分了解的”。
    马蒂诺还谈到意大利同阿尔巴尼亚的关系。他指出：意大利不久以前同阿尔巴尼亚开始的谈判进行得很顺利。保存阿尔巴尼亚的独立和完整是符合意大利的利益和西方的利益的。
