Xinhua News Agency, October 4th. Burmese Ambassador to China, U Hla Maung, held a grand reception on the evening of the 4th. This reception was held to welcome the Burmese Federal Buddhist Delegation led by U Tun Maung, the Burmese Federal Cultural Delegation led by U Win, the Burmese Military Goodwill Delegation led by Lieutenant General Ne Win, and the Burmese Postal and Telecommunications Delegation led by U Maung Aung, who are visiting China.

Attending this evening's reception were Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Chen Yun, Peng Dehuai, Chen Yi, Ulanhu, and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Shen Junru, and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Dingcheng, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Marshal Nie Rongzhen, Cheng Qian, Zhang Zhizhong, and Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference He Xiangning and Zhang Bojun, Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Zhu Xuefan, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian.

More than 500 people attended this evening's reception, including members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, directors and deputy directors of the offices of the State Council, ministers and vice ministers of the ministries and commissions, chairmen and vice chairmen of the committees, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, members of Standing Committee of the National Committe of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, heads of democratic parties and people's organizations, heads of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, and representatives from religious, cultural, and other circles in the capital.

Heads of diplomatic missions and diplomatic officials of various countries in China were also invited to attend the reception.

At the reception, Burmese Ambassador to China U Hla Maung and Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai delivered speeches successively.

Ambassador U Hla Maung said in his speech: Today is a very memorable day, and it will become a milestone in the history of our two countries. It is of great significance that the four Burmese delegations are coming to Beijing when China is celebrating the sixth anniversary of its liberation. More importantly, these four delegations are led by the highest-ranking figures in Burma, which clearly shows the depth of friendship between our two countries. Although these four delegations will be conducting their own inspections of different projects in China and working within their respective areas, they have a common goal in China, which is to further consolidate Burmese-Chinese friendship.

Ambassador U Hla Maung explained the significance of the four delegations' visit to China. He said that with China's consent, the Burmese Federal Buddhist Delegation would be able to bring the Buddha's tooth relic to the Burmese Federation. This sacred relic will be like a beacon of Burmese-Chinese friendship, forever radiating the light of our friendship. The performances of the Burmese Federal Cultural Delegation in China will further develop cultural exchanges between Burma and China. The visit of the Burmese Military Goodwill Delegation to China will promote the friendship between the two armed forces that defend freedom and peace. The Burmese Postal and Telecommunications Delegation can shorten the distance between the two countries and bring us closer together.

Ambassador U Hla Maung said: Through mutual visits of goodwill, inspection and trade delegations, our two countries have gained a lot of understanding. I believe that after these four Burmese delegations visit various parts of China, the friendship between our two countries will be strengthened many times over, and the five principles formulated by the Prime Ministers of our two countries for mutual benefit will be realized more concretely.

Ambassador U Hla Maung finally raised his glass and proposed a toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people! To the growing friendship between the people of Burma and China! To peace in Asia and the world!

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his speech that, first of all, on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, he extended a warm welcome to the Burmese Federal Buddhist Delegation, the Burmese Federal Cultural Delegation, the Burmese Military Goodwill Delegation, and the Burmese Postal and Telecommunications Delegation.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that China and Burma have been close neighbors since ancient times. The people of our two countries, especially the residents on the border between the two countries, have had close trade and cultural exchanges since ancient times. This friendly exchange between the peoples has never been interrupted through various historical periods. But only after China was liberated and Burma gained independence could the friendship between our two countries gain truly broad prospects for development on a new basis. In June 1954, the Prime Ministers of China and Burma issued a joint statement, which clearly stipulated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the basic guideline for developing friendly relations between our two countries. Over the past year or so, the friendly exchanges between our two countries in economic, cultural, religious and other aspects have become more frequent and close. This kind of friendly exchange not only greatly helps to further mutual understanding, trust and cooperation between the governments and peoples of the two countries, but also has great benefits for maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

Premier Zhou Enlai said: The ever-developing friendly relations between our two countries are fully in line with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Peaceful coexistence between countries with different systems has not only deeply won the hearts of the people of the world and become the common belief of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people, but has also become a fact existing in international relations. There is no doubt that the development of friendly relations between China and Burma is also fully in line with the spirit of the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference. The resolutions of the Asian-African Conference emphatically pointed out the necessity of strengthening friendly relations between Asian and African countries and the importance of such friendly relations for promoting world peace. It can be said that the development of friendly relations between China and Burma provides an example for the implementation of the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference.

Premier Zhou Enlai finally raised his glass and proposed a toast to the further development of friendly cooperation between China and Burma, and to the health of President Ba U.

During the banquet, Head of Delegation U Tun Maung, Head of Delegation U Win, Head of Delegation Ne Win, Head of Delegation U Maung Aung and others frequently raised their glasses to offer toasts, Vice Premier Chen Yun, Marshal Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier Chen Yi and others also raised their glasses in return. Warm applause and joyful laughter rang out from time to time in the banquet hall. The banquet was conducted in a friendly atmosphere.

After the reception, the Burmese Federal Cultural Delegation performed wonderful programs.

    新华社四日讯　缅甸联邦驻华大使吴拉茂在四日晚举行盛大招待会。这个招待会是为以吴登貌为首的缅甸联邦佛教代表团，以吴温为首的缅甸联邦文化代表团，以奈温中将为首的缅甸军事友好代表团和以吴梅昂为首的缅甸邮电代表团来中国访问而举行的。
    出席今晚招待会的，有国务院总理周恩来，副总理陈云、彭德怀、陈毅、乌兰夫、李先念，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、沈钧儒、陈叔通，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、北京市长彭真，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞，国防委员会副主席聂荣臻元帅、程潜、张治中、傅作义，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席何香凝、章伯钧，国务院秘书长习仲勋，邮电部部长朱学范，文化部部长沈雁冰，外交部副部长张闻天。
    出席今晚招待会的共有五百多人，他们之中还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员，国务院各办公室主任、副主任，各部部长、副部长，各委员会主任、副主任，中国人民解放军高级将领，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员，各民主党派、各人民团体负责人，北京市人民委员会负责人，首都宗教、文艺以及其他各界人士。
    各国驻华使节和外交官员也应邀出席了招待会。
    在招待会上，缅甸联邦驻华大使吴拉茂和中华人民共和国国务院总理周恩来先后讲了话。
    吴拉茂大使在讲话中说：今天是一个非常值得纪念的日子，它将成为我们两国历史上的一个标志，意义重大的是缅甸的四个代表团正值中国庆祝解放六周年纪念时来到北京，更重要的是这四个代表团都由缅甸最高级人物率领，这一切很明显地表示我们两国间友谊的深厚。这四个代表团，在中国虽然将各自考察不同的项目并在各自不同的范围内进行工作，但他们在中国有一个共同的目的，就是更进一步巩固缅中友谊。
    吴拉茂大使对四个代表团访华的意义作了说明。他说，缅甸联邦佛教代表团得到中国的同意，能将佛牙迎奉到缅甸联邦去，这个神圣的遗物将如同缅中友好的灯塔一样，永远使我们的友谊放出光芒。缅甸联邦文化代表团在中国的演出，将会使得缅中两国的文化交流得到进一步的发展。缅甸军事友好代表团的访问中国，将促进保卫自由与和平的两支武装部队之间的友谊。缅甸邮电代表团可以把两国之间的距离缩短，使我们更为亲近。
    吴拉茂大使说：由于亲善、考察和贸易代表团的互相访问，我们两国之间已经获得了很多谅解。我相信，在这四个缅甸代表团到中国各地去访问后，我们两国之间的友谊将因而加强许多倍，由我们两国总理为了相互的利益而制定的五项原则将更具体地实现。
    吴拉茂大使最后举杯提议为中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的健康干杯！为缅甸和中国人民之间日益增长的友谊干杯！为亚洲和世界和平干杯！
    周恩来总理在讲话中首先代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，向缅甸联邦佛教代表团、缅甸联邦文化代表团、缅甸军事友好代表团和缅甸邮电代表团，表示热烈的欢迎。
    周恩来总理说，中缅两国很早以来就是亲密的邻邦。我们两国的人民，尤其两国边境上的居民，从古代起，就有密切的贸易和文化来往。这种人民间的友好往来经过各个历史时期都从没有间断过。但只有到中国获得解放和缅甸得到独立之后，我们两国的友谊在新的基础之上才能够获得真正广阔的发展前途。一九五四年六月，中缅两国总理发表了联合声明，明确规定以和平共处的五项原则作为指导我们两国发展友好关系的基本方针。一年多来，我们两国的经济、文化、宗教和其他方面的友好往来是更加频繁和密切了。这种友好往来，不仅大大有助于两国政府之间和两国人民之间的进一步互相了解、信任和合作，而且对于维护亚洲和世界的和平也有很大的好处。
    周恩来总理说：我们两国之间这种日益发展着的友好关系，完全符合和平共处的五项原则。不同制度的国家和平共处，不仅已经深得世界人心，成为亿万爱好和平人民的共同信念，而且已经是国际关系中存在着的事实。毫无疑问，中缅两国友好关系的发展，也是同亚非会议决议的精神完全一致的。亚非会议的决议，强调地指出了加强亚非各国友好关系的必要性和这种友好关系对于促进世界和平的重要意义。完全可以说，中缅友好关系的发展，为执行亚非会议的决议提供了一个范例。
    周恩来总理最后举杯提议，为中缅两国友好合作的进一步发展，为巴宇总统的健康干杯。
    宴会进行中，吴登貌团长、吴温团长、奈温团长、吴梅昂团长等频频举杯敬酒，陈云副总理、彭德怀元帅、陈毅副总理等也举杯回敬。宴会厅中不时响起热烈的掌声和欢乐的笑声，宴会一直在友好的空气中进行。
    招待会后，缅甸联邦文化代表团演出了精彩节目。
