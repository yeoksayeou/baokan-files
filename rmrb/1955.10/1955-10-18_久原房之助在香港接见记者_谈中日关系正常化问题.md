Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, October 17th: Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" reported on October 17th: Kuzuhara Fusanosuke, Chairman of the National Council for the Restoration of Japanese-Chinese and Japanese-Soviet Diplomatic Relations, arrived in Hong Kong on the 16th on his way back to Japan after visiting China for nearly two months.

When meeting with reporters, Kuzuhara Fusanosuke first told them that the purpose of his visit was to enable the people of China and Japan to understand each other well and to further promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

He said that the friendship and deep understanding between the people of the two countries may not be enough to restore normal relations between the two countries, but we can use this as a basis for promoting the establishment of further relations.

Kuzuhara Fusanosuke believes that the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations largely depends on the international atmosphere. He said that we feel that the Chinese people are sincerely asking to normalize Sino-Japanese relations, and so far, the Japanese people also hope that the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations can be realized. However, due to the international atmosphere and the attitude of the Japanese government, this issue has to remain in its current state.

Kuzuhara told reporters that it is natural for the Japanese people to demand the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. He said that this is not a problem, and the people of the two countries absolutely need to have normalized relations. Japan and China are neighboring countries. More than a thousand years ago, Japan learned a lot from China. Therefore, we should naturally have normalized relations. If anyone says that he does not want the normalization of Japanese-Chinese relations, then he must be crazy. We hope for the normalization of relations because we must be friendly with our neighbors. Economically, we need Japan to have more trade with China, and with the help of trade, Japan's economy can be improved.

    久原房之助在香港接见记者
    谈中日关系正常化问题
    新华社广州十七日电　香港“文汇报”十月十七日报道：恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议会长久原房之助在对中国作了将近两个月的访问后，十六日在返国途中到达香港。
    久原房之助在接见记者时首先对记者们说，他这次访问的目的是要使中日两国人民能够很好地彼此了解，并且进一步促进中日关系的正常化。
    他说，两国人民间的友谊和深刻的了解也许还不能使两国的关系恢复正常，但是，我们能利用这点作为促进建立进一步的关系的基础。
    久原房之助认为，中日关系的正常化在很大程度上取决于国际气氛。他说，我们觉得中国人民是诚心诚意地要求使中日关系正常化的，而且至今为止，日本人民也希望中日关系的正常化得以实现。但是由于国际气氛和日本政府的态度，这个问题只得处于现在所处的状态。
    久原对记者们说，日本人民要求中日关系正常化，这是很自然的。他说，这一点是没有问题的，两国人民绝对需要有正常化的关系。日本同中国是毗邻的国家。远在一千多年以前，日本就从中国学到了很多东西。因此我们自然应有正常化的关系。如果有谁说他不愿意日中关系正常化，那他一定是发疯了。我们希望关系正常化，因为我们必须同邻邦友好相处。就经济而论，我们需要日本同中国进行更多的贸易，通过贸易的帮助，日本的经济才能改善。
