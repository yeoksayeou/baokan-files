    Berlin German State Opera House
    The Berlin German State Opera House is Germany's most famous opera house with a long history. After four years of reconstruction work, it officially reopened on September 4th this year.
    The State Opera House was originally built in 1743, designed by Knobelsdorff, the famous architect who built the Potsdam Palace during the reign of Frederick the Great II. In 1843, the theater was destroyed in a fire. The German people, who loved their national culture and art, rebuilt it according to the original design. During World War II, the theater was destroyed again. In 1951, under the call of the government of the German Democratic Republic and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, workers, students, and office staff in Berlin began a new reconstruction effort. They transported truckloads of broken bricks and tiles. The construction workers used their labor and wisdom to restore it to even greater beauty than before. This restoration made the 200-year-old opera house a true asset of the people for the first time.
    The opera house itself is an integrated whole combining modern equipment and beautiful architectural forms. Its exquisite statues, paintings, and majestic form reflect the style of German national architecture. Its interior decoration and colors give a feeling of comfort and harmony. The rest corridors are paved with green marble, and the walls are ivory-colored. The "Apollo Hall" for relaxation gives a feeling of sunshine and comfort. The walls and railings of the auditorium are decorated with gold and white. The orchestra pit and three floors together have a total of 1,500 seats.
    The stage equipment is highly mechanized. This is a combination of revolving, lifting, and rotating stages, divided into the main stage, back stage, and side stage, which facilitates rapid changes of scenery. The stage is also equipped with various recording, television, and filming equipment. Radio and television stations can broadcast theater programs directly from here. This stage has a total of 260 switches, managed by a central technical control station.
    On the opening night, the opera house staged Wagner's famous German opera "The Mastersingers of Nuremberg." To commemorate the completion of the opera house, many famous plays were scheduled during the opening performance period from September 4th to October 15th, including Beethoven's "Fidelio," Mozart's "Don Giovanni," and Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin."
    Tickets for this period have long been sold out. Long-term tickets for factories and government offices, accounting for 60% of the total tickets, have all been booked until the summer of 1956. Now, there is often a long queue in front of the theater ticket office. People are buying or reserving tickets. Among them are also people from West Berlin and West Germany, who cherish the cultural heritage of the German nation. They believe that German culture and art are unified and indivisible, and are jointly loved by the German people.
    The completion and opening performance of the Berlin German State Opera House is a major event in the life of the German people. "Neues Deutschland" wrote: "The whole country can rightly be proud of this beautiful theater. The work completed by our architects, engineers, and construction workers is proof of our ever-developing culture and a testament to the great role that art plays in the lives of the working masses in our country."

    柏林德国国家歌剧院
    柏林德国国家歌剧院是德国最著名的具有悠久历史的歌剧院。经过四年来的重建工作，它已在今年九月四日正式开幕公演了。
    国家歌剧院最初建于一七四三年，是由腓特烈大帝二世时代建造波茨坦王宫的著名建筑师克诺贝尔斯道夫设计建筑的。一八四三年这座剧院在一次大火中被毁。热爱祖国文化艺术的德国人民又把它按照原来的形式修复起来。第二次世界大战中，剧院再一次被毁。一九五一年，在德意志民主共和国政府和德国统一社会党的号召下，柏林的工人、学生、机关职员开始新的重建工作。他们运走了一车又一车的碎砖破瓦。建筑工人们用他们的劳动和智慧把它修复得比以前更加美丽。而这次的修复使这所具有二百多年历史的歌剧院第一次成为真正属于人民的财富了。
    歌剧院本身是现代化设备和美丽的建筑形式相结合的整体。它的精致的雕像、绘画和宏伟的体形表现了德国民族建筑的风格。它的内部装饰和色彩给人以舒适和谐的感觉。休息走廊铺设着绿色的大理石，墙壁是象牙色的。供休息用的“阿坡罗厅”，使人有一种阳光四射的舒畅之感。观众大厅墙壁和栏杆上全是金色和白色的彩饰。大厅池座和三层楼一起共有一千五百个座位。
    舞台装置高度机械化。这是由轮动、升降和转动舞台构成的一个组合，分为主台，后台，侧台等，便于迅速变换布景。舞台上还装置着录音、电视和拍摄电影的各种设备。广播台和电视台可以直接从这里放送戏院节目。这座舞台一共有二百六十个各种开关，由一个总的技术中心站管理。
    在开幕日的晚上，歌剧院上演了德国著名歌剧华格纳的“纽伦堡的歌手”。为纪念歌剧院的建成，在从九月四日到十月十五日的开幕演出期间，排有许多著名剧目，其中有贝多芬的“费德里奥”，莫扎特的“堂·琼”以及柴可夫斯基的“叶夫根尼·奥涅金”等著名歌剧。
    这一段时间的戏票早已被订完了。占总票数百分之六十的工厂、机关的长期票更已经全部预订到一九五六年夏季。现在在剧院售票处前面，经常排着长长的队伍。人们在购买或预订戏票。这里面也有来自西柏林和西德的人民，他们珍爱德意志民族的文化遗产。他们认为德意志文化艺术是统一而不可分割的，是德国人民所共同热爱的。
    柏林德国国家歌剧院的重建完成和开幕公演，是德国人民生活中的一件重大事情。“新德意志报”这样写道：“整个国家可以正当地以这座美丽的剧院而自豪。我们的建筑家、工程师和建筑工人所完成的工作，是我们的日益发展的文化的证明，也是艺术在我国劳动群众的生活中所起的巨大作用的证明。”
