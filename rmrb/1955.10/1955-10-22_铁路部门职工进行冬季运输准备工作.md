Railway department employees are actively engaged in various preparations for winter transportation as the busy winter transportation season approaches.

Since September, locomotive personnel in the railway department have been working on repairing locomotives. The Andong Locomotive Depot has eliminated all substandard locomotives, and the number of locomotives in good condition has increased by 35% compared to the spring inspection. By the end of September, over 80% of the steam pipelines in the Hohhot Locomotive Depot had been wrapped. The Harbin Locomotive Depot, which undertakes a large amount of transportation tasks, has installed coal pushers on fourteen locomotives. They have also filled the insulation covers for thirty-five locomotives and plan to install snow sweepers on all operating locomotives by the end of October. Many units have also prepared coal and sand for winter use.

To maintain over-axle operation in cold weather, many units have made technical and ideological preparations. Many locomotive depots have conducted climbing demonstrations in difficult sections. The Jilin Railway Bureau printed over 1,700 copies of the "Winter Work Regulations" for locomotive crews and distributed them to each chartered group. In addition to revising the technical operation procedures for difficult sections, the Harbin Locomotive Depot has been educating and training crew members who have not participated in winter transportation and those who had accidents during winter transportation last year. After this training, these personnel have improved their skills and increased their confidence.

Carriage operation personnel have also received cold-proof coats, boots, and gloves. The traffic control rooms, which directly command train operations, and other work rooms are actively preparing heating equipment, some of which is already complete. Car personnel have also made preparations based on their work situations. At the end of September, the Zhangjiakou Railway Station organized a small "Winter Safety Training Class" to educate employees on winter safety operations.

Engineering personnel have been actively eliminating frost damage and areas of mud pumping on the lines since earlier in the year. Because steel rails are prone to fracture in winter, causing train accidents, engineering personnel in various railway administrations are actively inspecting and replacing severely damaged rails. The Beijing Railway Administration inspected and found one hundred and ten severely damaged rails in September and completed their replacement by the end of September. The Jinzhou Railway Bureau also inspected and found two hundred and seventy-one severely damaged rails by the end of September and is actively replacing them.

To ensure the smooth completion of the winter transportation tasks, the railway transportation departments conducted a comprehensive inspection in September. Leading staff members of each railway administration led inspection teams to inspect work in their respective jurisdictions, promptly and specifically proposed measures, and eliminated shortcomings.

    铁路部门职工进行冬季运输准备工作
    繁忙的冬季运输即将到来，铁路运输部门各工种的职工正积极进行冬季运输的各项准备工作。
    铁路部门机务人员从九月份起就着手整修机车。安东机务段已经消灭了不合格的机车，良好状态的机车比春季鉴定时提高了百分之三十五。呼和浩特机务段到九月底，已有百分之八十以上的机车蒸气管路都缠完了。担任大量运输任务的哈尔滨机务段，已给十四台机车安装上推煤机，他们还灌好了三十五台机车灌被，并准备在十月底将全部运用机车装上扫霜器。许多单位还准备好了冬季用的煤和砂。
    为了在寒冷的气候中仍然能做到超轴，很多单位进行了技术上、思想上的准备工作。不少机务段分别在困难区段进行爬坡表演；吉林局印制了一千七百多册机车乘务员“冬季工作细则”发给各包车组；哈尔滨机务段除了修改困难区段的技术作业过程表外，对没有参加过冬季运输的乘务员和去年参加冬季运输而出过事故的乘务员进行教育和培养，这些人员经过教育后，都提高了技术，增强了信心。
    办理车辆作业的车务人员们也都领到了防寒大衣，防寒靴和防寒手套。直接指挥行车的运转室以及其他作业室，都在积极准备取暖用具，有的已准备齐全。车务人员也结合工作情况进行了准备，张家口车站在九月末曾经组织了小型“冬季安全训练班”，向职工进行了冬季安全作业的教育。
    工务人员很早前就积极消灭线路冻害处所、翻浆冒泥地段。由于冬季钢轨容易折断，造成行车事故，各管理局的工务人员都积极地检查重伤钢轨并进行撤换。北京铁路管理局在九月份检查出来一百一十根重伤钢轨，已在九月底全部更换完毕；锦州局到九月底也检查出二百七十一根重伤钢轨，正在积极更换。
    为了保证冬季运输任务的顺利完成，铁路运输各部门在九月份又进行了一次全面的检查。各个管理局的领导工作人员都分别带领检查组到各管辖单位检查工作，及时地、具体地提出了措施，消灭了缺点。（人民铁道报编辑部）
