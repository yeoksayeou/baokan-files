Xinhua News Agency, October 16th: According to TASS, the British Labour Party's 54th Annual Conference, which opened in Margate on October 10th, concluded on the 14th.

At the beginning of the last meeting, many delegates expressed dissatisfaction from ordinary members with the conference organization, as too little time was allocated for discussing important issues related to party policy. These delegates suggested continuing the meeting on the afternoon of the 15th to discuss the parliamentary party group's work report and many other issues in detail. However, the chairman of the organizing committee, Clough, opposed this proposal, and it was rejected.

When discussing the Labour Party parliamentary group's work report, the first to speak was Yates, who vehemently protested the expulsion of six members of parliament from the parliamentary group for voting against the Paris Accords, which stipulated the arming of West Germany. He said that he had opposed and still opposed the Paris Accords. He also expressed his gratitude to the ordinary party members who supported him in opposing the accords. His words were met with applause from the delegates.

Many delegates expressed concern about the difficult situation of the textile industry, and they demanded that the parliamentary party group more resolutely defend the interests of the textile industry in parliament.

Some also criticized the parliamentary party group's position and domestic policy issues.

After Attlee made a brief speech, the meeting passed the parliamentary party group's work report, followed by the report of the Labour Party National Executive Committee.
