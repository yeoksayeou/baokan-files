The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held a banquet on the afternoon of the 2nd to welcome the Japanese Kabuki Troupe led by Kunizo Matsuo and Ennosuke Ichikawa.

The banquet was presided over by Yang Hansheng, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. Among those present were playwrights, writers, and artists from the capital, including Tian Han, Ouyang Yuqian, Mei Lanfang, Shu Sheyu, Chen Baichen, Cao Yu, Zhao Shuli, Xie Bingxin, Dai Ailian, Meng Bo, as well as famous opera performers and young literary and art workers, totaling more than one hundred people.

Yang Hansheng delivered a welcoming speech at the banquet, saying: The Japanese Kabuki Troupe has come to our country for a visit, bringing the precious friendship and beautiful art of the Japanese people, and has been warmly welcomed by our cultural circles and the broad masses of the people. The visit of the Kabuki Troupe will enable the Chinese people to appreciate the excellent classical art of the Japanese people on their own stage. We hope that in the near future, the Japanese people will also be able to see performances of Chinese national art on the stage in Japan. The exchange performances of Chinese and Japanese dramas will bring the thoughts and feelings of the two peoples closer, thereby promoting the friendly unity of the two peoples.

Kunizo Matsuo and Ennosuke Ichikawa delivered speeches in reply, expressing their deep gratitude again for the grand welcome they received in China, and expressing that they would reciprocate with an equally grand welcome to the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe's visit to Japan.

During the banquet, Tian Han, Mei Lanfang, Ouyang Yuqian, and Shu Sheyu, on behalf of the Chinese literary and art circles and drama circles, delivered speeches to welcome the Japanese Kabuki Troupe. (Xinhua News Agency)
