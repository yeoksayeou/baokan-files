More than 500 local state-owned, joint state-private, and private mechanical and electrical factories in Shanghai have successfully trial-produced 3,160 new products in the past year, including 678 complete machines and sets. Among these new products are high-precision petroleum machinery parts to support the petroleum industry in Yumen and other places, "automatic lighting control switches" manufactured for Anshan Iron and Steel to control lighting electricity, as well as threshers, horse-drawn orchard sprayers, and other equipment needed for agricultural production.

In the past, most of these factories mainly manufactured and repaired textile machinery, ordinary lathes, and general parts and accessories. In order to meet the needs of national construction, these factories changed their production direction and trial-produced many new products. For example, based on the increasing development of the national petroleum industry and geological exploration work, from the fourth quarter of last year, the Shanghai industrial leadership departments organized a joint state-private Dalong Machinery Factory, which used to manufacture textile machinery, and private factories such as Lianyi and Qiujing to shift to the production of petroleum machinery parts. This year, ten factories, including the joint state-private Lisheng Factory and the private Antai Factory, will also manufacture such products. Due to insufficient equipment and technical strength, these factories adopted a collaborative production approach, with each factory responsible for different manufacturing tasks.

While organizing these mechanical and electrical factories to manufacture new products, the Shanghai industrial leadership departments also intensified the reform and transformation of these enterprises. This year, 60 factories manufacturing automobile parts, shipbuilding, and manufacturing boilers will undergo joint state-private ownership through separate joint ventures, larger factories leading smaller ones, or mergers. Through these measures, the technical and organizational level of each factory has also improved. For example, carburetors and universal joint cross bearings for automobile parts, which could not be manufactured domestically in the past, have now been successfully manufactured.

    上海市五百多家机电工厂一年来制成三千多种新产品
    上海市五百多家地方国营、公私合营和私营机电工厂，一年来试制成功了三千一百六十种新产品，其中整台、整套的新产品有六百七十八种。这些新产品中，有支援玉门等地石油工业的精密度要求很高的石油机械配件，有为鞍钢制造的控制照明用电的“自动照明控制开关”，也有农业生产中需要的脱粒机、马拉式果园喷雾器等。
    过去，这些工厂大都是制造和修配纺织机械、普通车床和一般零件、配件的工厂。为了适应国家建设的需要，这些工厂改变了生产方向，试制了许多新产品。例如，根据国家石油工业和地质勘探工作日益发展的情况，从去年第四季度起，上海工业领导部门就组织一个制造纺织机械的公私合营大隆机器厂和私营联益、求精等厂转向石油机械配件的生产，今年还将有公私合营力生工厂、私营安泰工厂等十家工厂制造这类产品。这些厂由于设备和技术力量不足，就采取协作生产的方式，分工制造。
    上海市工业领导部门在组织这些机电工厂制造新产品的同时，还加紧进行了对这些企业的改革和改造工作。今年全年有制造汽车配件、造船、制造锅炉等的六十家工厂，分别采取单独合营、以大带小或者合并等方式进行公私合营。经过采取这些措施，各厂的技术组织水平也有了提高。如汽车配件的化油器、万向十字节连轴承等，过去国内不能制造，现在都已先后制造成功。
