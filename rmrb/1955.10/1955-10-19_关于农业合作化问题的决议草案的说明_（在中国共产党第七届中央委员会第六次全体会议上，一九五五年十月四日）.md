Explanation of the Draft Resolution on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperation
    (At the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, October 4, 1955)
    Chen Boda

    Comrade Mao Zedong’s report on the issue of agricultural cooperation, made at the meeting of provincial, municipal, and district party committee secretaries convened by the Central Committee on July 31, 1955, summarized the experience of our country’s agricultural cooperation movement over the years, emphatically criticized the main erroneous idea within the Party at present on the issue of developing agricultural cooperation, namely, right-leaning thought, and gave programmatic instructions on a series of issues such as the necessity and possibility of agricultural cooperation, the specific paths and steps of cooperation, and the working methods of leading cooperation. Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions enabled all comrades in the Party to be ideologically and organizationally prepared to meet the high tide of the socialist mass movement in the countryside, and to avoid major mistakes at this critical historical turning point.

    The Political Bureau of the Central Committee, based on Comrade Mao Zedong’s report, prepared a draft resolution on the issue of agricultural cooperation to be submitted to the plenary session. Because I am working in the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee designated me to give an explanation. I would like to say the following points.

    First, regarding the policy of developing agricultural cooperation.

    (1) The draft resolution points out that the peasant question has different contents in two different revolutionary stages. The Party's policies in the countryside must adapt to the new situation of revolutionary transformation and the new changes in class relations and class struggle in the countryside after land reform. The right-leaning errors of some comrades are due to their failure to see this new situation and new changes. As everyone knows, the Party's general line during the transition period includes three areas: the realization of socialist industrialization, the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. This general line cannot be divided, because the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation includes the entire national economy. The socialist economy must include the two major sectors of production: industry and agriculture. As Comrade Mao Zedong’s report pointed out, socialist industrialization cannot be carried out in isolation from agricultural cooperation; therefore, it is necessary to adopt a policy of adapting the steps of our country’s agricultural cooperation to the steps of our country’s socialist industrialization. We cannot put one foot on the basis of socialist industry and the other foot on the basis of the small-scale peasant economy. If we do not strive to get more than 500 million agricultural people to participate in socialist construction, we cannot imagine the victory of socialism. Therefore, in the current vigorous upsurge of socialist industrial construction, Comrade Mao Zedong's timely raising of the issue of developing cooperation to an important agenda of the Party's work is of great significance.

    (2) Our Party has led the bourgeois democratic revolution for nearly thirty years, and the work of all Party comrades has revolved around striving for the victory of this revolution. Therefore, when transitioning from this revolutionary stage to the socialist revolutionary stage, it is natural that some comrades lack mental preparation. However, our Party is a party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and armed with Marxism-Leninism. When our Party carried out the overthrow of the feudal landlords' land ownership, it also prepared to guide the peasants from realizing land to the tiller to realizing socialist cooperation. Comrade Mao Zedong's report mentions the history of our country's agricultural cooperation movement, and this history is also the history of the Party's policy gradually turning into practice.

    We can recall Comrade Mao Zedong’s writings at various periods, which expounded the Party’s policy. As everyone knows, during the First Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong’s “Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan” already listed the cooperative movement as a major event in the peasant movement, although according to the actual conditions at that time, it only mentioned supply and marketing cooperation and credit cooperation. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the experience of labor mutual aid societies and plowing teams created by the masses in the revolutionary base areas, pointed out the great role of this kind of labor mutual aid organization (that is, agricultural production cooperative organization) in agricultural production (see "Investigation of Changgang Township"). During the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade Mao Zedong gave two famous speeches, "On Cooperatives" and "Get Organized," calling on all anti-Japanese base areas to widely organize this kind of elementary production group of collective mutual assistance on the basis of the voluntary participation of the masses. Subsequently, Comrade Mao Zedong successively raised this issue in other works (for example, "On Coalition Government"). At the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party in 1949, when Comrade Mao Zedong explained the issue of economic construction after the liberation of the whole country, he pointed out: "If we only have the state-owned economy and no cooperative economy, we cannot lead the laboring people's individual economy to gradually move towards collectivization, and we cannot consolidate the proletariat's leadership in the state power. Whoever ignores or belittles this point will commit a great error." After the founding of the People's Republic of China, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's opinion, the Party Central Committee made a resolution on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation in December 1951, and in December 1953, it made another resolution on developing agricultural production cooperatives. All of this shows that the policy of agricultural cooperation is a consistent policy adhered to by the Party, and it is not raised suddenly. Some comrades feel that this policy is relatively sudden because they have not had time to seriously study this issue. The main reason is that many of our comrades joined the Party during the period of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal bourgeois democratic revolution, and they are usually familiar with only the program of the bourgeois democratic revolution in practice (that is, the Party's minimum program), and they have not yet become familiar with the Party's program of the socialist revolution (that is, the Party's maximum program). Therefore, just like with many other major new issues, it is necessary to seriously restudy the issue of agricultural cooperation, and in the course of studying, understand the errors, correct the errors, correctly grasp the Party's policies, and improve the level of one's Marxist-Leninist knowledge. This is the task placed before all of our Party comrades.

    (3) The draft resolution criticized some comrades' illusions of being content with the status quo in the countryside and being content with the small-scale peasant economy. It is very necessary for the Party to criticize such erroneous illusions. The problem is just as Comrade Mao Zedong told us at the Third Mutual Aid and Cooperation Work Conference convened by the Central Committee in October 1953: "If socialism does not occupy the rural position, capitalism will inevitably occupy it. Can it be said that one can neither take the road of capitalism nor the road of socialism?" After overthrowing the feudal land system, the struggle between the two roads of either developing capitalism or developing socialism appeared in the countryside, which is an inevitable law. Either this road or that road, it is either this or that, and there is no middle road. Some comrades are radical in the bourgeois democratic revolution, but after passing through this revolutionary stage, they are satisfied with the peasants having obtained land, and they hesitate at the crossroads between the two roads, and in fact, they are more interested in preserving the small-scale peasant economy than in leading the socialist transformation of agriculture. These comrades have not yet realized that the small-scale peasant economy is not a paradise for peasants, but precisely a garden in which capitalism can develop. Lenin said: "Small production constantly, daily, hourly, spontaneously, and on a mass scale gives rise to capitalism and the bourgeoisie." The so-called contentment with the status quo of the small-scale peasant economy is impossible; it can only be self-deception.

    We have a lot of materials on hand to prove the fact that wherever the mutual aid and cooperation movement develops, the general poor peasants rise faster economically, the class differentiation is smaller, the grain problem is easier to solve, and the countryside shows vitality; on the contrary, wherever the mutual aid and cooperation movement has not yet developed or is developing weakly, although the land ownership of the landlords has been eliminated and the lives of the peasants have improved to varying degrees, there are still many poor peasants who have not risen economically, and new class differentiation has already begun to occur. Some poor peasants have lost their land again, some old middle peasants have declined into poor peasants, and at the same time, some new rich peasants have emerged. In such places, our many tasks are more difficult to carry out, and the landlords, rich peasants, and various counter-revolutionary elements take advantage of this backward gap and attempt to restore their rule.

    Recently, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee reported to the Central Committee: some comrades were afraid that the development of cooperation would cause "trouble" and "give rise to emperors"; but the facts prove that "emperors" do not emerge in areas where the mutual aid and cooperation movement develops, the socialist position expands, and the peasants' awareness is raised faster, but in areas where the peasants' awareness is low, the cooperation movement does not develop, and the anti-feudal struggle is incomplete. From this report of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee, we should draw the conclusion that in order to protect the land fruits already obtained by the peasants, to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance and strengthen the leadership of the working class in this alliance after the land reform, and to fundamentally eliminate the possibility of counter-revolutionary restoration, there is no other way but to develop cooperation.

    (4) It cannot be assumed that the socialist transformation of agriculture will not encounter resistance. Comrade Mao Zedong's report is aimed at breaking this resistance ideologically. Agricultural production cooperatives are a new force, and as we know, any new force will encounter resistance from conservative forces, and the agricultural cooperation movement will certainly not be an exception. The conservative forces resisting agricultural cooperation come from the hostile classes on the one hand, that is, from the landlords, rich peasants, and other capitalist exploiting elements in the countryside, and on the other hand, from the capitalist spontaneous tendencies and the prejudices and habits of long-term individual management contained in the duality of the peasants themselves (mainly the well-to-do middle peasants). Since conservative forces exist in society, they will also be reflected in our Party in various forms, especially the sentiments of a portion of well-to-do middle peasants. The practice of adopting large-scale dissolutions and "resolute contractions" of cooperatives that occurred not long ago was in fact produced by the conservative thinking of some comrades who were content with the status quo of the small-scale peasant economy. This erroneous practice, from a social phenomenon point of view, is not accidental, but reflects the pressure of the bourgeoisie, rich peasants, or well-to-do middle peasants with capitalist spontaneous tendencies. On the one hand, it is the enthusiasm of the peasant masses (first of all, the positive elements of the poor peasants and the lower middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants) to organize cooperatives under the leadership of the Party, and on the other hand, it is the bourgeoisie, rich peasants, or well-to-do middle peasants with capitalist spontaneous tendencies who want to frustrate this enthusiasm. This is the contradictory phenomenon that exists in society now. The comrades who made mistakes did not distinguish between the two aspects of this contradiction, nor did they understand that in order to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, on the one hand, it is necessary to fully develop the enthusiasm of the peasants who are willing to take the socialist road, and on the other hand, it is necessary to further transform and overcome the backwardness of the peasants. These comrades who made mistakes, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "They are always standing on the position of the bourgeoisie, rich peasants, or well-to-do middle peasants with capitalist spontaneous tendencies to make plans for the few people, and they are not standing on the position of the working class to make plans for the entire country and all the people." Therefore, they put themselves in a very awkward position in front of the peasant masses: on the one hand, they publicized the general line to ask the peasants to take the socialist road, and on the other hand, they did not approve the establishment of cooperatives, and used "countless strict rules and precepts" to restrict cooperatives; on the one hand, they wanted to train activists to organize cooperatives, and on the other hand, in some places, there appeared such bizarre things as "cultivating activists to withdraw from the cooperatives" and "convening representative meetings of cooperative members who withdrew from the cooperatives to complete the task of contraction." Some peasants said: "The general line tells us to take the road of cooperation. When we set up cooperatives, you don't approve them, and you don't allow us to take the road of cooperation." "You say that the small-scale peasant economy is not good, and now you want us to develop individualism." Some cadres also said: "I have learned how to run cooperatives, but I have not learned how to disband cooperatives." These criticisms are very reasonable.

    However, new forces are always irresistible. As everyone knows, when our Party was established, when our Party led the peasant revolution, led the guerrilla war, and established base areas, because the strength was still small at the beginning, many people in society were unwilling to recognize it. What was the result? The result was that our Party and the new forces represented by our Party were victorious, and those who did not recognize it failed. Those who did not recognize it still had to recognize it in the end. Now there are many people who take an attitude of non-recognition towards cooperatives, and this is also destined to fail.

    What is the lesson? That is, we should get rid of the influence of conservative forces, we should look forward and see the new and positive things in the masses; we should not look backward, and look and look, and always only see the backward and negative things. As written in the draft resolution, respecting and inspiring the creativity and enthusiasm of the masses, and protecting the growth of new forces, is the task of leadership.

    Second, regarding the practical work of developing cooperation.

    After having a policy, the main thing is how to do a good job.

    (1) It is necessary to act in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on "according to the actual situation," "adapting to local conditions, and timely guidance." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "It must be seen now that a national high tide of socialist transformation will soon appear in the countryside, and this is inevitable." What is a high tide? That is to say, the nature of the movement has a broad mass scale, rather than being limited to the scope of a few activists. The arrival of the high tide cannot be achieved solely by the subjective wishes of the Party's leading organs or a few people, nor can it be forced, but it must have objective conditions, that is, things have not only affected a few people, but also affected the broad masses. Some people say: "The higher level says there is a high tide, so there is a high tide." This is an unanalytical statement, and it is incorrect. Why did Comrade Mao Zedong say at this time that the national high tide of agricultural cooperation is inevitable? From Comrade Mao Zedong’s report, we can learn that there are these three main bases: First, because the great upsurge of our country's national economy under the guidance of the first five-year plan, especially the construction of socialist industrialization and its achievements, is increasingly promoting the enthusiasm of the peasants to organize cooperatives; Second, because our country's mutual aid and cooperation movement has a considerable history, and the widespread mutual aid movement that has developed in various places has in fact prepared the conditions for organizing cooperatives, and the superiority of increased production shown by most of the hundreds of thousands of cooperatives that have been organized is encouraging a large number of peasants; Third, this high tide has already arrived in some places. These are the signs of the national high tide of agricultural cooperation. If one does not see these signs, and does not see the mainstream of this great life, it is inevitable to be thrown behind the masses, and as Comrade Mao Zedong described, become a wobbling small-footed woman in the high tide of the cooperation movement, or be frightened and unable to shoulder the task of leadership. Of course, this does not mean that the national cooperation movement will only develop according to the same model, and will advance at the same speed in all places. The draft resolution states that the development of the movement is uneven, and points out that there are three main types of differences in various places in the country. In the face of the new situation of the upcoming high tide of the national cooperation movement, we must take care of various local differences, and pay attention to these differences appropriately at any time in our work, in order to bring the agricultural cooperation movement into a unified and healthy development track. In May 1948, the Party Central Committee gave instructions on land reform work and Party rectification work: "It is necessary to educate cadres to be good at analyzing specific situations, and to decide the local and current work tasks and working methods based on the specific conditions of different regions and different historical conditions." There is no doubt that this instruction of the Party Central Committee is also fully applicable to leading the current cooperation movement.

    (2) The arrival of the high tide of the cooperation movement is due to objective possibilities on the one hand, and depends on the Party's hard and meticulous work on the other hand, and it will not come spontaneously. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: The central link in doing a good job in the cooperation movement is that the Party's leadership must catch up; the Party's leading organs must have an active, positive, happy, welcome, and all-out spirit, and take the leadership of the entire movement into their own hands (see the preface to "How to Run Agricultural Production Cooperatives"). That is to say, it is necessary to be good at combining the Party's leadership with the enthusiasm of the masses to organize cooperatives. As long as the Party's leadership work is done well, it is possible to promote the high tide of cooperation. Conversely, if the Party's leadership work is not done well, even if there are conditions for a high tide, a high tide may not appear; or even if such a high tide appears, it may suffer setbacks because it does not receive the Party's correct leadership. As everyone can see, haven't some places already had such a high tide, but because they encountered the completely wrong policy of the so-called "resolute contraction," the cadres and the masses were made to feel dejected?

    To do a good job in the Party's leadership, first of all, the Party's leading organs need to avoid blindness and increase foresight. To achieve this goal, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's statement, there must be a complete plan for one province, one county, one district, and one township, and not "just piecemeal work there." (See the preface to "How to Run Agricultural Production Cooperatives")

    Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Practice": "We often hear some comrades say when they cannot bravely accept work tasks: I have no confidence. Why is there no confidence? Because he does not have a regular understanding of the content and environment of this work, or he has never been exposed to this type of work, or he has not been exposed to it much, so he cannot talk about the regularity of this type of work." Now, some comrades, on the issue of cooperation, because they do not understand the situation, or because they only understand a partial situation, and do not understand the overall situation, or they know a lot of materials, but they do not look at the problem with the Marxist-Leninist method of class analysis, so they cannot understand the regularity of the cooperation movement itself, and they cannot see the essential aspect and the mainstream aspect of things, and therefore they lack foresight and lack confidence in their work. As a result, as Stalin said: "They honestly try to row, drift with the tide, and sail downstream, but they not only do not know where the river will take them, but they are also unwilling to know." Recently, a provincial party committee reported to the Central Committee: "In actual work, many organizations of party committees at all levels have not yet diligently studied the work of cooperatives, deeply understood the key issues in the movement, and summarized the experience of the movement's development. Therefore, we have implemented the correct things, and although we have resistance emotions towards the wrong things, we have also accepted them." This is an unconscious state. The reason why the "overall plan for cooperation" can become an important working method for us to change this unconscious state is because the planning work for cooperation will force all Party organs at all levels that are truly responsible for the revolution to make efforts to fully understand the situation, study the situation, and strive to learn to look at the problem with the Marxist-Leninist method of class analysis, so that they can gradually turn things that they were originally unfamiliar with into things that they are gradually familiar with, so that they can gradually understand the regularity of cooperation, which also generates the possibility of foresight. Of course, doing overall planning, especially at the beginning, always has things that are more or less incorrect, and it is necessary to continuously revise them according to the actual situation. However, with a plan, and it is also collectively drafted after practical and repeated investigations and research, and drafted after issuing proposals from top to bottom and discussing and revising them from bottom to top, things are always easier to handle, because this plan will urge us to work actively, and will awaken us to pay attention to and check the problems that occur in various aspects of our work. It will prove what is correct for us in the process of the cooperation movement's development, and it will also prove what is wrong for us.

    (3) Pay attention to the relationship between quantity and quality. Between this spring and summer, some comrades advocated the practice of "cutting off some cooperatives," and their "theoretical" basis was the so-called "too many cooperatives are difficult to manage." This is a "theory" that has completely gone bankrupt. The actual situation in many places is this: where more cooperatives are run, the enthusiasm of the masses is higher, the problems of cooperatives will be fewer, the rectification and consolidation of cooperatives will be easier, and the growth of production will be more effective. Why? Because more cooperatives mean that the whole Party pays more attention to cooperatives, and the cooperatives themselves have comparisons and competitions, and they can exchange experiences with each other, and they can promote backward cooperatives to learn from advanced cooperatives, and the talents of cadres are also easier to improve. At the same time, the principle is very clear that the expansion of the socialist position also reduces the capitalist position, and it can more powerfully resist the development of capitalist spontaneous forces. Assuming that a cooperative may be run very well at the beginning, but if there are no more cooperatives to promote each other in work and cooperate with each other in production, then it will not be possible to expand reproduction on a larger scale, and the improvement of the lives of cooperative members will inevitably be greatly limited. From this, we can draw the conclusion that changes in quantity to a certain extent will cause changes in quality. The improvement of quality cannot be separated from quantity. Separating the consolidation work of cooperatives from the development work of cooperatives, and thinking that the fewer the number of cooperatives, the better the consolidation work is, is purely an erroneous assumption.

    Of course, we cannot draw another conclusion from this, thinking that the development of cooperatives is a purely quantitative issue and does not need to take care of quality. The achievements of cooperation cannot be measured by simply pursuing numbers. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "It must be emphasized to pay attention to the quality of cooperatives, and oppose the tendency to disregard quality and specialize in pursuing the numbers of cooperatives and peasant households." Comrade Mao Zedong not only believes that a series of cooperative rectification works should be carried out after the establishment of cooperatives to strengthen the quality of cooperatives, but also believes that a series of preparatory works should be carried out before the establishment of cooperatives so that the number and quality of cooperative development can be unified. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "Do not fight unprepared battles, do not fight battles without certainty." "To have certainty, one must have preparation, and one must have full preparation." This is to remind us to pay attention: running cooperatives should not be done hastily, nor should we take the method of "forcing seedlings to grow." Some Party members are satisfied with formalism, are impatient to take the mass line to do a lot of preparatory work for establishing cooperatives, and attempt to achieve the purpose of simply pursuing numbers by means of coercion and command. Some even think that as long as they "shout a few slogans, they can achieve socialism in a few days," which of course is also a distortion of the Party's policy, and will similarly frustrate the enthusiasm of the masses to organize cooperatives, which is absolutely not allowed by the Party.

    (4) The plan for cooperation should be combined with the plan for production.

    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that land reform is to break the shackles of feudalist relations of production, which is the first step in the liberation of agricultural productive forces, "this is the first revolution." The socialist cooperation movement is the transformation from individual economy to the relations of production of collective economy, which is to break the shackles of capitalist relations of production, which is the second step in the liberation of agricultural productive forces, "this is the second revolution." Without this second revolution, a great development of productive forces is impossible. The peasants in our country are very diligent, but in the past, because they were subjected to the triple exploitation of foreign imperialism, feudalism, and capitalism, the agricultural productive forces were very backward, and the average yield per unit area of many agricultural products was much lower than that of many capitalist countries. What do we rely on to overcome this backwardness? Some people rely on the small-scale peasant economy, which is impossible, and the Party Central Committee has long criticized this erroneous view. Do we rely on capitalism? The road of capitalist increase in production is an extremely painful road for the vast peasant masses. The Party Central Committee has long pointed out that we cannot take this road. Our only hope can only be to rapidly improve our country's agricultural productive forces with the support of socialist industry through the road of cooperation, so that it can catch up with and surpass capitalist countries. According to many existing materials, after the establishment of cooperatives, if the work is done well and production develops year by year, it is possible to increase the income of peasants by about one time after four, five or six years. This is truly a remarkable event for our peasants who have suffered for thousands of years! The reason is that once the peasants are united in production, they can exert tremendous potential power. Recently, I saw an article in the newspaper published by the Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, summarizing the province's experience: "According to the survey, in the first year of establishment, the labor efficiency of the cooperative generally increased by 15 to 20 percent compared with the mutual aid group, and the efficiency of the use of draft animals increased by 20 to 25 percent compared with the mutual aid group. Due to the improvement of the efficiency of the use of productive materials such as draft animals and agricultural implements of cooperatives, it is possible to draw out a part of the productive forces to invest in new production. Calculated according to the above proportion, if the 22,000 cooperatives in the province are run well, there will be 150,000 laborers, more than 100,000 draft animals, and huge amounts of funds that can be used for expanded reproduction. At the same time, with the continuous development of the agricultural cooperation movement in the future, the trend of increased productivity will become more and more obvious and prominent." This shows that agricultural production cooperatives have a great possibility to fully utilize their superior conditions to achieve the goal of continuous increase in production.

    Therefore, every cooperative should start preparing a plan for developing production at the same time as it is established; every county, district, township (or village)—and especially the township (or village)—should also study the overall plan for developing production there at the same time as it formulates an overall plan for developing cooperation. This overall production plan can provide peasants with the long-term goals of agricultural construction in their township and village on a larger scale, based on the specific conditions of the locality and combined with the common interests of the cooperatives. There is not much specific experience in this regard now, but as cooperatives develop batch by batch and in pieces, the need for this kind of overall production plan will become increasingly apparent. It is very necessary for Party committees at all levels to pay appropriate attention to this issue and rely on the wisdom of the masses to start studying it.

    The explanations on the draft resolution are mainly these. Comrade Mao Zedong's report has already said: "Neither socialist industrialization nor socialist transformation is easy. It is true that there are many difficulties in changing about 110 million peasant households from individual management to collective management and then completing the technical reform of agriculture; but we should believe that our Party is capable of leading the masses to overcome these difficulties." We should not avoid difficulties (such as not daring to ask about cooperatives); nor should we panic in the face of difficulties (such as "cutting off" a large number of cooperatives); but we must be prepared to overcome all possible difficulties in the course of advancement at any time, although this difficulty may also be local, but negligence is always wrong. The policy of cooperation of our Party Central Committee is correct, and the steps of cooperation are reliable. As long as all our Party comrades, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, unite as one, closely contact the masses, and work diligently, will there still be any doubts about completing this great historical task? I think there is no doubt about this.

    关于农业合作化问题的决议草案的说明
    （在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议上，一九五五年十月四日）
    陈伯达
    毛泽东同志一九五五年七月三十一日在中央召集的省委、市委和区党委书记会议上所作的关于农业合作化问题的报告，总结了我国多年的农业合作化运动的经验，着重地批判了目前党内在发展农业合作化问题上的主要错误思想即右倾思想，而就农业合作化的必要和可能、合作化的具体道路和步骤、领导合作化的工作方法等等一系列的问题，作了纲领性的指示。毛泽东同志的指示，使得全党同志能够在思想上和组织上有准备地去迎接农村的社会主义群众运动的高潮，而在现在这个重大的历史转变关头得以避免重大的错误。
    中央政治局根据毛泽东同志的报告，准备了一个向全会提出的关于农业合作化问题的决议草案。因为我在中央农村工作部担任一部分工作，中央政治局指定我来作一个说明。我想说的有下列的几点。
    第一，关于发展农业合作化的方针问题。
    （一）决议草案指出了农民问题在两个不同革命阶段上具有不同的内容。党在农村中的政策必须适应于革命转变的新情况和农村中在土地改革以后的阶级关系、阶级斗争的新变化，有些同志的右倾错误就是由于看不见这种新情况和新变化。大家知道，党在过渡时期的总路线包括了实现社会主义工业化，农业、手工业的社会主义改造和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造这样三个方面。这个总路线是不能够分割的，因为社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业，是包括整个国民经济的。社会主义经济必须包括生产的主要的两个大部门，即：工业和农业。正如毛泽东同志的报告所指出的，社会主义工业化是不能离开农业合作化而孤立地去进行的，因此，必须采取使我国农业合作化的步骤和我国的社会主义工业化的步骤相适应的方针。我们不能够把一只脚踩在社会主义工业的基础上，而把另一只脚踩在小农经济的基础上。如果不争取五亿多的农业人口来参加社会主义建设，我们就不能够设想社会主义的胜利。因此，在目前社会主义工业建设的蓬蓬勃勃的高潮中，毛泽东同志及时地把发展合作化的问题提到全党工作的重要日程上，具有非常重大的意义。
    （二）我们的党曾经在几乎三十年这样长的时间内，领导了资产阶级民主革命，全党同志的工作都围绕于争取这个革命的胜利。因此，在从这个革命阶段转变到社会主义革命阶段的时候，有些同志缺乏精神的准备，这是很自然的。但是，我们的党是以毛泽东同志为首的、由马克思列宁主义武装起来的党。我们的党在进行推翻封建地主的土地所有制的时候，也就准备了引导农民从实现耕者有其田到实现社会主义合作化的道路。毛泽东同志的报告中说到我国农业合作化运动的历史，而这些历史也就是党的这个方针逐步变为实践的历史。
    我们可以回忆一下毛泽东同志在各个时期的著作所阐明的党的这个方针。大家知道，在第一次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志的“湖南农民运动考察报告”已经把合作社运动列为农民运动的一件大事，虽然根据那时实际的条件，还只说到供销合作和信用合作。在第二次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志根据革命根据地群众创造的劳动互助社和耕田队的经验，指出了这种劳动互助组织（也即是农业的生产合作组织）在农业生产上的伟大作用（参看“长冈乡调查”）。在抗日战争时期，毛泽东同志作了“论合作社”和“组织起来”的两次著名讲话，号召各抗日根据地应该在群众自愿的基础上，广泛地组织这种集体互助的初级的生产团体。随后，毛泽东同志在其他著作中又陆续地提出这个问题（例如“论联合政府”）。在一九四九年党的七届二中全会上，毛泽东同志在说明全国解放后经济建设问题的时候指出：“单有国营经济而没有合作社经济，我们就不可能领导劳动人民的个体经济逐步地走向集体化，就不可能巩固无产阶级在国家政权中的领导权。谁要忽视或轻视这一点，谁也就要犯绝大的错误。”在中华人民共和国成立以后，根据毛泽东同志的意见，党中央在一九五一年十二月间做出了一个关于农业生产互助合作的决议，在一九五三年十二月间又做出一个关于发展农业生产合作社的决议。所有这些都说明了：关于农业合作化的方针，是党一贯坚持的方针，并不是突如其来地提出来的。有些同志对于这个方针所以感到比较突然，这是因为他们还没有来得及认真地研究这个问题。主要的，就是因为我们许多同志是在反帝反封建的资产阶级民主革命时期中参加党的，平日在实际中熟悉的只是关于资产阶级民主革命的纲领（即党的最低纲领），而还没有熟悉党的关于社会主义革命的纲领（即党的最高纲领）。因此，正如对待其他许多重大的新问题一样，在农业合作化的问题上也必须认真地重新学习，而在学习中去懂得错误，修正错误，去正确地掌握党的方针、政策，提高自己的马克思列宁主义知识的水平。这是放在我们全党同志面前的任务。
    （三）决议草案批评了有些同志的安于农村现状、安于小农经济的幻想。党很有必要来批评这类错误的幻想。问题正如毛泽东同志在一九五三年十月间中央召开第三次互助合作工作会议的时候所告诉我们的：“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。难道可以说既不走资本主义的道路，又不走社会主义的道路吗？”在推翻封建的土地制度之后，农村中出现了关于或是发展资本主义或是发展社会主义的两条道路的斗争，这是必然的规律。或者是这样的道路，或者是那样的道路，非此即彼，中间的道路是没有的。有的同志对于资产阶级民主革命是急进的，但在走过这个革命阶段之后，却满足于农民已经得到土地，徘徊在两条道路之间的十字街口，而在实际上，对于保留小农经济的兴趣大于领导农业社会主义改造的兴趣。这些同志还没有了解到：小农经济并不是农民的天堂，而正是资本主义能够借以发展的园地。列宁说过：“小生产是经常地，每日每时地，自发地，大批地产生着资本主义和资产阶级的。”所谓安于小农经济的现状，这是不可能的，这只能够是自己欺骗自己。
    我们手头有很多的材料证明这样的事实：凡是互助合作运动发展的地方，一般贫农在经济上就上升得快，阶级分化就小，粮食问题好解决，农村中表现生气勃勃；反之，凡是互助合作运动还没有发展，或者发展得很薄弱的地方，虽然已经消灭了地主的土地所有制，农民的生活有不同程度的改善，但是还有许多贫农在经济上没有上升，而且已经在开始发生新的阶级分化，有些贫农重新失掉土地，有些老中农下降为贫农，同时有些新富农出现了。在这样的地方，我们的许多工作的进行就比较困难，而地主富农和各种反革命分子就钻着这个落后的空隙而企图复辟。
    最近甘肃省委向中央的报告说过：有的同志害怕合作化发展下去会“出乱子”，“出皇帝”；但是事实证明，“皇帝”不是出在互助合作运动发展、社会主义阵地扩大、农民觉悟提高较快的地区，而是出在农民觉悟低、合作化运动不发展、反封建斗争不彻底的地区。从甘肃省委这个报告应该得出这样的结论：要保护农民已经得到的土地果实，要在土地改革之后进一步地巩固工农联盟和加强工人阶级在这个联盟中的领导作用，要根本消灭反革命复辟的可能性，除了发展合作化，再没有别的道路。
    （四）不能设想农业的社会主义改造会遇不到抵抗。毛泽东同志的报告就是为的在思想上打破这种抵抗。农业生产合作社是一种新生的力量，而我们知道，任何新生力量都会遇到保守力量的抵抗，农业合作化运动当然不会是例外。抵抗农业合作化的保守力量，一方面来自敌对的阶级，即来自地主、富农和农村中其他资本主义剥削分子，另方面还来自农民（主要是富裕中农）本身的两重性所包含的资本主义自发倾向和农民长期个体经营的偏见和习惯。保守力量既然在社会上存在，也就会经过各种形式反映到我们党内来，特别是一部分富裕中农的情绪会反映到我们党内来。不久以前发生过的对合作社采取大批解散和“坚决收缩”的做法，这在实际上是由于一部分同志安于小农经济现状的保守思想所产生出来的。这种错误的做法，从社会现象来看，并不是偶然的，而是反映了资产阶级、富农、或者具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农的压力。一方面是农民群众（首先是贫农和新老中农中间的下中农的积极分子）在党领导下组织合作社的积极性，另方面是资产阶级、富农、或者具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农要挫折这种积极性。这就是社会上现在存在的矛盾现象。犯错误的同志没有去辨别这种矛盾的两个方面，也没有懂得要巩固工农联盟，一方面需要充分发扬农民愿意走社会主义道路的积极性，另方面又需要进一步地改造和克服农民的落后性。这些犯错误的同志，正如毛泽东同志所指出的：“他们老是站在资产阶级、富农、或者具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农的立场上替较少的人打主意，而没有站在工人阶级的立场上替整个国家和全体人民打主意。”因此，他们就使得自己在农民群众面前处于非常尴尬的地位：一方面宣传总路线要农民走社会主义道路，另方面又不批准成立合作社，用“数不尽的清规和戒律”来限制合作社；一方面要训练组织合作社的积极分子，另方面在有些地方却又出现了所谓“培养退社积极分子”、“召开退社社员代表会议去完成收缩任务”这类稀奇古怪的事情。有的农民说：“总路线叫我们走合作化的道路，我们办起社来，你们又不批准，又不准我们走合作化的道路。”“你们说小农经济不好，现在又要我们发展个人主义。”有的干部也说：“我学过办社，没有学过散社。”这些批评是很有道理的。
    但是，新生力量总是不可抵抗的。大家知道，当我们党成立的时候，当我们党领导农民革命、领导游击战争、建立根据地的时候，因为在开始的时候力量都还是小的，社会上许多人不肯承认，结果如何呢？结果还是我们的党和我们的党所代表的新生力量胜利了，不承认的人失败了。不承认的人结果也还是要承认了。现在又有许多人对合作社采取不承认的态度，这也是注定要失败的。
    教训是什么呢？这就是我们应当摆脱保守力量的影响，应当向前看，看群众中新生的积极的东西；而不应当向后看，看来看去，总只看落后的消极的东西。如像决议草案上所写的，尊重和启发群众的创造性和积极性，保护新生力量的生长，这是领导的任务。
    第二，关于发展合作化的实际工作问题。
    有了方针之后，主要的是要怎样去做好工作。
    （一）必须遵照毛泽东同志关于“按照实际情况”、“因地制宜、及时指导”的指示去办事。毛泽东同志说：“必须现在就要看到，农村中不久就将出现一个全国性的社会主义改造的高潮，这是不可避免的。”什么是高潮？就是说，运动的性质具有广大的群众规模，而不是只局限在少数积极分子的范围内。高潮的到来，是不能够单凭党的领导机关或者少数人的主观愿望就会出现的，也不能够勉强制造的，而是要有客观的条件，即事情已经不只是牵动了少数人，而且牵动着广泛的群众。有人这样说：“上级说有高潮，就算有高潮。”这是不加分析的说法，是不正确的。为什么毛泽东同志在这个时候说农业合作化的全国性的高潮是不可避免的？从毛泽东同志的报告中，我们可以了解到有这三个主要的根据：第一，因为我国国民经济在第一个五年计划的指导下的巨大高涨，特别是社会主义工业化的建设和它的成就，正在日益促进着农民组织合作社的积极性；第二，因为我国互助合作运动已经有相当的历史，各地方已经发展的广泛的互助运动在事实上是为组织合作社准备了条件，而已经组织起来的几十万个合作社大多数所表现的增产优越性，正在鼓励着大量的农民；第三，这种高潮在有些地方已经到来了。这些就是农业合作化的全国性的高潮的预兆。没有看到这种预兆，没有看到这个伟大的生活的主流，就不可避免地要被抛落在群众的后面，如像毛泽东同志所形容的，在合作化运动高潮中成为摇摇摆摆的小脚女人，或者被吓昏了头脑，而不可能担当起领导的任务。当然，这不是说，全国合作化运动将只会按照一个同样的模型发展起来，在一切地方都将按照同样的速度前进。决议草案说明了运动的发展是不平衡的，指出了全国各地方有主要的三类情况的差别。在全国合作化运动高潮即将到来这个新形势的面前，我们必须照顾各种局部的差别，并且在工作中随时适当地去注意这些差别，才能够把农业合作化运动纳入统一的健康发展的轨道。一九四八年五月间党中央关于土地改革工作和整党工作曾经指示：“必须教育干部善于分析具体情况，从不同地区、不同历史条件的具体情况出发，决定当地当时的工作任务和工作方法。”毫无疑义的，党中央的这个指示也完全适用于领导现在的合作化运动。
    （二）合作化运动高潮的到来，一方面是由于客观的可能性，另方面是依赖于党的艰苦的和细致的工作，而不会是自流到来的。毛泽东同志指出：搞好合作化运动的中心环节，是党的领导要赶上去；党的领导机关要有一种主动的、积极的、高兴的、欢迎的、全力以赴的精神，把整个运动的领导拿到自己的手里来（参看“怎样办农业生产合作社”序言）。这就是说，必须善于把党的领导和群众组织合作社的积极性互相结合起来。只要党的领导工作做得好，就有可能促进合作化高潮。反之，如果党的领导工作做得不好，即使有高潮的条件，也是不能够出现高潮的；或者即使出现这样的高潮，也可能因为得不到党的正确的领导而遭受挫折。大家看，不是有些地方已经有这样的高潮，因为遇到那种所谓“坚决收缩”的完全错误的方针，而使干部和群众弄得垂头丧气吗？
    要搞好党的领导，首先需要党的领导机关避免盲目性，增加预见性。而要达到这样的目的，按照毛泽东同志的说法，就要有一省一县一区一乡的完整的规划，不要“只是零敲碎打地在那里做”。（参看“怎样办农业生产合作社”的序言）
    毛泽东同志在“实践论”中说过：“常常听到一些同志在不能勇敢接受工作任务时说出来的一句话：没有把握。为什么没有把握呢？因为他对于这项工作的内容和环境没有规律性的了解，或者他从来就没有接触过这类工作，或者接触得不多，因而无从谈到这类工作的规律性。”现在有些同志在合作化问题上，因为不了解情况，或者因为只了解片面的情况，而并不了解全面的情况，或者是知道的材料并不少，但不是用马克思列宁主义的阶级分析的方法看问题，所以也就不能够了解合作化运动本身的规律性，不能够看到事物的本质方面，主流方面，因而缺乏预见，缺乏工作上的把握，结果就像斯大林说过的那样：“他们诚实地努力摇桨，随波逐流，顺水驶去，至于河水究竟会把他们冲到何处去，那他们是不仅不知道，并且也不愿意知道的。”最近有一个省委向中央的报告说道：“在实际工作中各级党委的许多组织还没有踏踏实实地钻研合作社的工作，深入了解运动中的关键问题，总结运动发展的经验。所以正确的东西，我们执行了；错误的东西，虽有抵触情绪，也接受了。”这是一种不自觉的状态。“合作化的全面规划”的所以能够成为我们改变这种不自觉状态的一种重要的工作方法，就是因为合作化的规划工作，将迫使各级一切真正对革命负责的党的机关不能不去努力全面地了解情况，研究情况，不能不去努力学习用马克思列宁主义的阶级分析的方法看问题，因而使自己本来不熟悉的东西能够逐渐变为熟悉的东西，使自己能够逐渐了解合作化的规律，这也就产生着预见的可能性。当然，搞全面规划，特别在开始的时候，总是时常有或多或少不正确的东西，需要根据实际情况，不断地加以修正。但是，有了一个规划，并且它又是经过切实的、反复的调查研究而集体地拟定的，经过自上而下发出方案和自下而上讨论修改而拟定的，事情总要好办些，因为这个规划将督促我们去积极地工作，将唤起我们去经常注意和检查工作中各方面所发生的问题。它将在合作化运动发展的过程中证明我们正确的是什么，也将证明我们错误的是什么。
    （三）注意数量和质量的关系。今年春夏之间，在有些同志中发生过主张“砍掉一些合作社”的做法，他们的“理论”根据，是所谓“合作社多了，不好办”。这是已经完全破产了的“理论”。很多地方的实际情况是这样：那里合作社办得多，那里群众的积极性就更高，合作社的问题就会要少些，合作社的整顿和巩固就来得更容易一些，生产的增长也更有成效。为什么？因为合作社多了，就更加吸引全党对合作社的重视，而合作社本身就有了比较，有了竞赛，可以互相交流经验，可以促进落后的合作社向先进的合作社看齐，干部的才干也就更容易提高。同时，道理是很清楚的，社会主义阵地的扩大，也就缩小了资本主义的阵地，也就能够更强有力地抵抗资本主义自发势力的发展。假定有个合作社在开始的时候也可能办得很不错，但是如果没有更多的合作社在工作上来互相促进，在生产上来相互配合，那末，它也就不可能在更大的范围内扩大再生产，合作社社员生活的提高也必然要受到很大的限制。由此可以得出结论：数量的变化到一定程度将引起质量的变化。质量的提高是不能够抛开数量的。把合作社的巩固工作同合作社的发展工作分裂开来，认为合作社的数量越少，巩固工作越好做，这纯粹是一种错误的设想。
    当然，也不能由此得出另一种结论，认为合作社的发展是一个单纯数量的问题，不需要照顾质量。合作化的成绩是不能够用简单追求数字的办法来衡量的。毛泽东同志说：“必须强调注重合作社的质量，反对不顾质量、专门追求合作社和农户的数目字的那一种偏向。”毛泽东同志不仅认为需要在建社之后应该经过一系列的整社工作，来加强合作社的质量，并且认为需要在建社之前应该经过一系列的准备工作，使合作社发展的数量和质量能够统一起来。毛泽东同志告诉我们：“不打无准备的仗，不打无把握的仗。”“要有把握，就要有准备，而且要有充分的准备。”这就是要我们注意：办合作社不应该草率从事，也不能够采取那种“拔苗助长”的办法。有些党员满足于形式主义，不耐烦走群众路线去做建社的许多准备工作，企图用强迫命令的方法去达到单纯追求数字的目的，有的甚至认为只要“喊几个口号，几天就搞到社会主义”，这当然也是歪曲了党的政策，同样地会挫折群众组织合作社的积极性，是党所绝对不许可的。
    （四）合作化的规划要和生产的规划相结合。
    毛泽东同志指出过：土地改革是打破封建主义生产关系的束缚，这是农业生产力的第一步解放，“这是第一个革命”。社会主义的合作化运动是从个体经济转到集体经济的生产关系，是打破资本主义生产关系的束缚，这是农业生产力的第二步解放，“这是第二个革命”。没有这第二个革命，生产力的大发展是不可能的。我国的农民非常勤苦，但过去因为受外国帝国主义、封建主义和资本主义的三重剥削，以致农业生产力很落后，许多农产品的平均单位面积产量比起许多资本主义国家都还要低得很多。我们要指望什么来克服这种落后呢？有些人指望小农经济，这是不可能的，党中央早已批驳了这种错误的观点。难道指望资本主义吗？资本主义增产的道路，对于广大农民群众说来，是一条那末长期的极端痛苦的道路，党中央早已指出，我们不能走这样的道路。我们惟一的指望只能是在社会主义工业的支持下经过合作化这一条道路来迅速地提高我国农业的生产力，使它赶上并超过资本主义国家。根据现有的许多材料看来，合作社建立起来之后，如果工作得好，生产逐年发展，有的经过四年，五年或六年，就有可能使农民增加收入到一倍左右。这对于我们几千年来受苦受难的农民说来，真是一件了不起的大事！原因就是农民一经在生产上联合起来，就能够发挥巨大的潜在力量。最近在报上看到黑龙江省委农村工作部发表一篇总结该省经验的材料：“据调查，建社头一年合作社的劳动效率比互助组一般地提高百分之十五到二十，耕畜运用效率比互助组提高百分之二十到二十五。由于合作社的耕畜、农具等生产资料运用效率提高，就有可能抽出一部分生产力投向新的生产。以上述比例计算，全省两万二千个合作社，如果办的好，将有十五万个劳动力、十万多匹耕畜和巨量资金可以用于扩大再生产。同时，随着今后农业合作化运动的不断发展，生产力增加的趋势将越来越更明显和突出。”这就说明，农业生产合作社有很大的可能来充分利用自己的优越条件，以达到不断增产的目的。
    因此，每一个合作社在它建立起来的时候，就应当同时着手准备发展生产的计划；每一个县、区、乡（或村）——而尤其是乡（或村）在拟定发展合作化的全面规划的时候，也就应当同时研究那里发展生产的全面规划。这种全面的生产规划，能够在更大的范围内，根据本地方的具体条件，结合各合作社的共同利益，给农民提供本乡本村长期的农业建设的目标。现在关于这方面的具体经验还不算多，但是合作社一批一批地和成片地发展，就会日益显出有这种全面生产规划的需要。地方各级党委适当地注意这个问题，依靠群众的智慧着手加以研究，这是很必要的。
    关于决议草案的说明，主要的就是这些。毛泽东同志的报告已经说过：“社会主义工业化和社会主义改造都不是容易的事情。要将大约一亿一千万农户由个体经营改变为集体经营，并且进而完成农业的技术改革，确有很多的困难；但是我们应当相信，我们党是能够领导群众克服这些困难的。”我们不应当回避困难（例如不敢过问合作社）；更不应当在困难面前惊惶失措（例如“砍掉”大批合作社）；而是必须随时准备克服在前进中的一切可能遇到的困难，虽然这种困难也可能是局部的，但是疏忽总是不对的。我们党中央的合作化的方针是正确的，合作化的步骤是可靠的，只要我们全党同志在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的领导下，团结一致，密切地联系群众，勤勤恳恳地工作，那末，完成这个伟大的历史任务还会有疑问吗？我想，这是没有疑问的。
