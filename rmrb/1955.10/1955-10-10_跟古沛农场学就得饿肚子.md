“Following the example of Gupei Farm means going hungry”

The Gupei District Farm in Jiashan County, Anhui Province, has suffered a serious reduction in production this year. The yields of various crops are generally lower than the planned figures, with grain output reaching only 55.2 percent of the plan and oil crop output only 42.1 percent of the plan.

What are the reasons why this farm failed to meet its plan? Was the plan too ambitious? No, the farm's production plan for this year was very conservative. Last year, the average yield of rice was 350 jin per mu, while this year's planned yield was only 320 jin. The planned yields of other crops were also not high compared to last year's actual yields. Was it due to a special natural disaster? No, this year the weather was "favorable," and the dryland crops of ordinary farmers grew very well. So, where exactly is the problem? A look at the farm's production situation will reveal the answer.

After the farm's rice seedlings were planted, no one weeded or hoed them, nor was any topdressing fertilizer applied. As a result, the weeds grew tall and dense, crowding the rice and preventing it from developing fully. The farm's "integrated seedling fields" were only formalistically divided into rows using straw ropes. Although they looked good, no one weeded the weeds, no one treated the insects, and there was no rational irrigation or management.

The farm also blindly interplanted sorghum and rice in the wheat fields. Sorghum is a crop that needs hoeing, but it could not be hoed when crowded with rice plants. When the rice needed water, the sorghum was too small to withstand the water. As a result, tending to one harmed the other, and in the end, both seasons yielded less grain than one season.

The farm had six or seventy mu of land near the stream that could be used to grow rice seedlings with stream water, and it used to yield two crops of rice and wheat. But this year, none of these fields were used to grow rice seedlings; instead, they were all planted with low-yielding lazy rice (i.e., rice sown directly in early spring). High-yielding crops like potatoes were planted in barren soil (i.e., dry soil lacking organic matter) and sticky soil, and later, no one irrigated or fertilized them, so that five mu and five fen of land yielded only one thousand jin, becoming a "low-yielding crop."

The farm's production is so poor that it must be blamed on the serious bureaucratic style of the leadership. Formulating a plan is the key to good production, but the farm's production plan was not studied or discussed by the staff; it was simply formulated by a few leaders, and then everything was considered to be fine, and there was no talk of implementing or inspecting it afterwards. The leaders also had no concrete plans for the usual agricultural arrangements and labor allocation, and some workers were so idle that they simply slept. Wang Bingkui, the farm manager, did not understand production but was unwilling to learn. When the beans needed hoeing, he said, "No need to rush." As a result, he hired people to hoe them only when the ground was dry. There are many more jokes like this.

Such a farm cannot set a proper example for the surrounding farmers. Some farmers sarcastically said, "Following the example of Gupei Farm means going hungry."

### “跟古沛农场学就得饿肚子”

    “跟古沛农场学就得饿肚子”编辑同志：
    安徽省嘉山县古沛区农场今年减产情况严重。各种作物的收获量普遍低于计划数字，其中粮食产量只达到计划的百分之五十五点二，油料产量只达到计划的百分之四十二点一。
    这个农场完不成计划的原因是什么呢？是计划订大了吗？不，农场今年的生产计划是很保守的。去年水稻每亩平均产量三百五十斤，而今年计划产量只有三百二十斤；其他作物的计划产量和去年实际产量比较起来也不算高。是受了特殊自然灾害吗？也不是，今年“风调雨顺”，一般农民的旱粮都长得很好。那末，问题究竟在那里呢？看一下这个农场的生产情况就可以知道了。
    这个农场的水稻种上以后就没有人锄和薅，也不加追肥；结果杂草长得又多又高，挤得稻子不能充分发育生长。农场的“合式秧田”只是形式主义地用草绳分出一行行的畦，样子虽好看，但是杂草没有人薅，虫也没有人治，更谈不到合理的灌溉和管理了。
    这个农场还盲目地在麦地里套种高粱和稻谷。高粱是需要锄的庄稼，挤在稻棵里就不能锄；当稻子需要水的时候，高粱还小得支不住水。于是，顾了这就损了那，结果两头全落了空，两季收的粮食还没有一季多。
    这个农场靠涧边的六、七十亩土地可以引涧水栽秧，本来都是收两季稻麦；但今年这些田都没有栽秧，却全部种上低收成的懒稻（即早直播的稻谷）。而高产作物的马铃薯却被种在马干土（即缺乏有机物的干土）和黏土地里，后来又没有人灌水施肥，以致五亩五分地只收了一千斤，变成了“低产作物”。
    农场的生产这样糟，不能不归罪于领导人员的严重官僚主义作风。订计划是搞好生产的关键，但是这个农场的生产计划并没有经过职工的研究和讨论，只是由几个领导人员订了就万事大吉，以后也谈不到贯彻和检查。领导人员对平时的农事安排、劳力调配也根本没有具体打算，有些工人闲得只好睡觉。农场场长王炳魁不懂生产，但又不肯学习。豆子该锄的时候，他却说“不用忙”；结果等到地干了才又雇人去锄。这种笑话还多得很。
    这样的农场当然不能在周围农民中树立应有的榜样。有的农民讽刺地说：“跟古沛农场学就得饿肚子。”
