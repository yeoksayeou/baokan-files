Since the armistice, the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers soldiers, together with the soldiers of the Korean People's Army, have firmly defended the peaceful frontier of our motherland, actively assisted the Korean people in the post-war restoration and construction of the people's economy, and given great encouragement and inspiration to the Korean people who are striving to realize the peaceful reunification of their country.

We sincerely wish the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers soldiers even greater achievements in guarding the peaceful labor of the Korean people and consolidating the cause of the Korean armistice with high vigilance alongside the Korean People's Army, and in the struggle to strengthen their combat effectiveness.
