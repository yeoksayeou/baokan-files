More than 100,000 new agricultural production cooperatives established
Grassroots Party organizations in Shanxi Province are leading farmers to build cooperatives

(This article is transmitted by) This newspaper reports that the agricultural cooperation movement has begun to form a high tide in some parts of our country. According to incomplete statistics from Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Guizhou and other places, more than 100,000 new agricultural production cooperatives have been built.

In Jiangsu Province, eight special districts including Huaiyin and Yancheng had built more than 44,500 new cooperatives and were building more than 21,000 by the end of September. A total of more than 66,000 new cooperatives have been built or are being built. Together with the original 35,000 old cooperatives, there are more than 100,000 new and old cooperatives in the province, with more than 2.9 million peasant households joining the cooperatives, accounting for about 33 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province. After more than a month of development work, some areas have approached or exceeded their development plans for this winter and next spring. For example, the Huaiyin Special District originally planned to develop more than 12,000 new cooperatives, but more than 13,000 have already been built.

As of September 28, Anhui Province had established 16,735 new cooperatives. The Fuyang Special District is establishing 6,305 new cooperatives, exceeding the first batch of cooperatives planned before the autumn harvest by 26.1 percent; the Suxian Special District has begun to establish 4,420 new cooperatives, exceeding the pre-autumn cooperative establishment plan by more than 33 percent. The expansion of old cooperatives is also being carried out universally. According to incomplete statistics, 55 cooperatives have completed their expansion work, and 7,668 cooperatives are in the process of expanding. It is expected that the first batch of cooperative establishment and expansion work before the autumn planting in the province will be basically completed by mid-October.

More than 20,000 new cooperatives have been built in Hunan Province, and the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the province has increased to more than 30,000. At the same time, mutual aid teams have also developed considerably. After the autumn cooperative establishment, more than 75 percent of the townships have cooperatives, and the impact of cooperation is more widespread and profound. Thousands of peasants in the province are eagerly demanding to join agricultural cooperatives. According to the understanding of typical townships in the lake area of ​​Yuanjiang, Yiyang, Xiangyin and other counties, the peasant households who have verbally or in writing applied to join the cooperatives account for 60 to 70 percent of the peasant households who have not joined the cooperatives, among which the poor peasants have the highest enthusiasm for joining the cooperatives. At present, all localities have further revised the original plans for developing agricultural cooperatives, and are actively making preparations to strive for the development of 75,000 cooperatives in the province by next spring.

From July to the end of September this year, Guizhou Province established more than 25,000 new agricultural production cooperatives, including 1,791 cooperatives established by ethnic minorities in the six special districts of Zunyi, Bijie, Tongren, Xingyi, Zhenyuan, and Anshun, and 4,455 cooperatives established jointly by different ethnic groups. Before July this year, there were more than 6,400 agricultural production cooperatives in the province. With the addition of newly established cooperatives, there are now more than 31,400, basically achieving the goal of having cooperatives in every township. These new cooperatives were built on the basis of year-round mutual aid teams, so the quality is relatively good. Now, the newly built cooperatives have devoted themselves to production. It is understood that the first batch of more than 10,000 agricultural production cooperatives established have actively carried out work such as accumulating fertilizer, fighting disasters, and protecting seedlings, which has greatly demonstrated the superiority of the cooperatives.

Recently, more than 1.44 million peasant households in Shandong Province have joined the long-established and newly established agricultural cooperatives, reaching more than 84 percent of the province's development plan for this winter and next spring. The Huimin Special District has basically completed the task of absorbing more than 220,000 new members this winter and next spring. Laiwu, Sishui, Ningyang, Licheng and other counties have all overfulfilled their plans. In addition, many farmers are actively planning to establish cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, October 8th. Various activities to establish new agricultural production cooperatives and expand old cooperatives have been widely launched in rural areas of Shanxi Province. More than 13,000 rural branches of the Communist Party of China are explaining the cooperative charter to the numerous farmers who have applied to join and establish cooperatives, and leading them to visit old cooperatives and hold small forums with members of old cooperatives. Many areas have begun to establish new cooperatives.

There are more than 3,000 propagandists participating in the propaganda activities in the counties of Yuci Special District. They were all selected from old cooperatives and underwent short-term training. With their own experience, they answered many difficult questions for the vast number of farmers who demanded to join the cooperatives. The Party branch of some townships also used the specific facts of the rich peasants' sabotage of the cooperative movement to educate the peasants to raise their revolutionary vigilance.

Some townships in the three special districts of Changzhi, Yuci, and Southern Jin have now made overall plans for the cooperation of the township, and have begun to help those farmers who are planning to establish cooperatives to establish new cooperatives. Pingyao, Jincheng and other counties have transferred more than 3,300 backbone members from the old cooperatives to the new cooperatives that are being established.

The grassroots Party organizations in rural areas of Shanxi Province play a very important role in leading the cooperative movement. 80 percent of the rural Party branches in the province have five years of experience in leading farmers to run cooperatives, and many rural Party members have become the leading backbone and active members of existing agricultural production cooperatives. In the first half of this year, the rural Party organizations also absorbed more than 12,300 newly emerged advanced farmers into the Communist Party of China in the agricultural cooperation movement. 69.4 percent of the existing cooperatives in the province have established Party branches or groups, and the Party organizations in the cooperatives have played a fortress role in consolidating and running these agricultural production cooperatives well.

    江苏、安徽、湖南、贵州、山东等省  
    新建十多万个农业生产合作社
    山西全省基层党组织正领导农民建社
    本报讯　农业合作化运动在我国有些地方已开始形成高潮。现据江苏、安徽、湖南、贵州等地不完全统计，已新建成农业生产合作社十多万个。
    江苏省淮阴、盐城等八个专区到九月下旬已经建成新社四万四千五百多个，正在建的有二万一千多个，共有六万六千多个新社已经建成或正在建立，加上原有三万五千多个老社，全省已有新老社十万多个，入社农户达到二百九十多万户，约占全省总农户百分之三十三。经过这一个多月的发展工作，有的地区已经接近或超过了今冬明春的发展计划。如淮阴专区原计划发展一万二千多个新社，目前已建成的有一万三千多个。
    安徽省截至九月二十八日止，各地已办了一万六千七百三十五个新社。阜阳专区正在办的新社有六千三百零五个，超过秋前第一批办社计划百分之二十六点一；宿县专区已开始办的新社有四千四百二十个，超过秋前办社计划百分之三十三强。老社的扩大工作也正在普遍展开。据不完全统计，已经结束扩大工作的有五十五个社，正在扩大的有七千六百六十八个社。预计全省秋种前第一批建社扩社工作，到十月中旬即可基本结束。
    湖南省已有二万多个新社建成，全省农业生产合作社已发展到三万多个，与此同时，互助组也有相当的发展。经过秋季建社，百分之七十五以上的乡都有了社，合作化影响更为广泛、深刻。全省成千成万的农民都迫切要求加入农业社，根据沅江、益阳、湘阴等县滨湖地区典型乡的了解，目前口头或书面申请入社的农户占没有入社的农户百分之六、七十，其中贫农要求入社情绪最高。目前各地都进一步修订了原来发展农业社的计划，并积极进行准备，为全省明春发展到七万五千个社而努力。
    贵州省从今年七月起到九月底止，新建了两万五千多个农业生产合作社，其中遵义、毕节、铜仁、兴义、镇远、安顺六个专区的少数民族建立了
  一千七百九十一个社，由不同的民族联合起来建立的合作社有四千四百五十五个。在今年七月以前，全省已有六千四百多个农业生产合作社，加上新建立的社，现在共有三万一千四百多个，基本上达到乡乡有社。这些新社是在常年互助组的基础上建成的，因此质量都比较好。现在，新建社都已全力投入了生产。据了解，第一批建立的一万多个农业生产合作社，都积极进行了积肥、抗灾、保苗等工作，大大地显示了合作社的优越性。
    山东省最近已有一百四十四余万户农民，分别加入成立已久的和新成立的农业合作社，达到全省今冬明春发展计划的百分之八十四以上。惠民专区基本上完成了今冬明春吸收新社员二十二万多户的任务，莱芜、泗水、宁阳、历城等县都超额完成了计划。此外，还有很多农民正在积极酝酿办社。
    新华社太原八日电　山西省各地农村中建立新的农业生产合作社和扩大老社的各种活动已普遍展开。一万三千多个中国共产党的农村支部，正向众多的申请入社和办社的农民讲解社章，并领导他们参观老社、同老社社员举行小型座谈会等。不少地区已着手建立新社。
    榆次专区各县参加宣传活动的宣传员共有三千多人，他们都是从老社挑选出来的，并经过短期的训练。他们以本身的经历，向广大要求入社的农民解答了很多疑难问题。有的乡的党支部还用富农破坏合作化运动的具体事实，向农民进行了提高革命警惕性的教育。
    长治、榆次和晋南三个专区的部分乡里，现在已经作出了乡的合作化全面规划，并且动手帮助那些酝酿建社的农民建立新社。平遥、晋城等县已从老社给现在正在建立的新社调配了三千三百多名骨干分子。
    山西省农村的基层党组织在领导合作化运动中发挥极大的作用。全省百分之八十的农村党支部有五年的领导农民办社的经验，许多农村党员成为现有农业生产合作社的领导骨干和积极分子。今年上半年农村党组织又在农业合作化运动中吸收了新涌现出来的一万二千三百多名先进农民加入中国共产党。全省现有社中百分之六十九点四的社都已建立党的支部或小组，社内的党组织在巩固和办好这些农业生产合作社中起了堡垒作用。
