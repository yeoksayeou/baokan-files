    An Old Prescription
    In his foreign policy speech on October 10, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles boasted about the "prosperity" of the U.S. economy. He depicted the U.S. economy as "an example of an economy with great productivity and fair distribution," claiming that in the U.S., there exists "satisfaction among the people" alongside production, where people "compete with each other and can produce more," and "distribution is widespread, thus continuously raising the standard of living."

    However, not all Americans are as satisfied with the U.S. economic situation as Dulles. Adlai Stevenson of the Democratic Party is one such example.

    In his speech at the University of Texas on September 28, Stevenson acknowledged that there are "serious defects" in the U.S. economy, and that "certain economic trends indicate trouble ahead." He said, "Agricultural operators are not sharing any of the benefits in this period of prosperity." The "prices of agricultural products continue to fall, while the prices of consumer goods do not fall, and manufacturers' profits have increased to unprecedented levels. In the past, such a trend was a warning of ominous prospects."

    Stevenson pointed out that the current "prosperity" of the U.S. economy is false. He noted that in the past year, automobile sales "have not been maintained by current income and people's purchasing power, but by the unprecedented expansion of installment purchases." The same is true for home purchases. In the stock market, "the speculation we have seen on Wall Street this year is the most intense since 1929."

    Stevenson pointed out the signs that an economic crisis is approaching in the United States. However, he could not come up with any solutions. He merely asked U.S. leaders to "talk less about how great the scale of prosperity is, and more about how to make it last longer," that is, to try to delay the outbreak of the economic crisis as much as possible.

    Does Dulles have a better solution? In his foreign policy speech, he stated that in order to find outlets for U.S. productivity, the United States not only "does not intend to disarm itself," but also must build so-called "defensive forces" and "use our military and economic power." He also stated that without doing so, one cannot "have confidence in our future." It can be seen that Dulles can still only offer the old prescription of arms expansion and war preparations. But facts have long proven that this old prescription cannot cure the terminally ill U.S. economy. (Dan)

### 陈旧的药方

    陈旧的药方
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在十月十日发表的外交政策演说中，吹嘘美国经济的“繁荣”。他把美国经济描绘成是“具有极大的生产力并能进行公平的分配的经济的范例”。说什么在美国和生产同时存在着“人们的满足”，人们“互相竞争并且可以生产更多的东西”，“并且分配广泛因而促使生活水准不断上升”。
    但是，并不是所有的美国人都像杜勒斯这样对于美国的经济情况感到心满意足的。美国民主党的史蒂文森就是一个例子。
    史蒂文森九月二十八日在得克萨斯大学的演说中承认美国经济中存在着“严重的缺陷”，“某些经济趋势指明了面前的麻烦”。他说：“农业经营者在这个繁荣的时期完全没有分享任何好处”。农产品的“价格在继续下跌，而消费品的价格则没有下跌，制造商的利润增加到了空前的水平。在过去，这样一种趋势就是前途不妙的警告”。
    史蒂文森指出，目前美国经济的“繁荣”是虚假的。他指出，在过去一年中，汽车的出售“不是靠目前的收入和人民的购买力维持的，而是靠分期付款的购买的空前扩大来维持的”。购买房屋的情况也是如此。在股票市场上，“我们今年在华尔街看到的投机之风是一九二九年以来最烈的一年”。
    史蒂文森指出了美国经济危机越来越近的迹象。但是，他拿不出任何办法来。他只是要求美国的领袖们“少谈一些繁荣的规模有多么大，而应该多谈一些如何使它维持得长远些”，也就是设法尽可能延迟经济危机的爆发。
    杜勒斯有没有更好的办法呢？他在外交政策演说中表示，为了使美国的生产力找到出路，美国不但“不打算使自己解除武装”，而且还要建立所谓“防御力量”和“使用我们的军事和经济力量”。他并且表示，不这样就不能够“对我们的将来有信心”。可见，杜勒斯能够拿出来的还是那一付扩军备战的老药方。但是事实早已证明，这个陈旧的药方是医治不好病入膏肓的美国经济的。（丹）
