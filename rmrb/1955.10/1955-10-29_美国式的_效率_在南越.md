    American-Style "Efficiency" in South Vietnam
    The U.S. State Department felt very "satisfied" with the farce of Ngo Dinh Diem's self-proclaimed "presidential" "referendum," and praised it as "conducted in such an orderly and efficient manner."

    Just how "efficient" Ngo Dinh Diem was can be understood by comparing a few figures. According to Reuters, the Ngo Dinh Diem group registered "3.5 million" "voters," and on the day of the vote, "about 50 percent of the voters abstained." However, in the so-called "official results" announced by the Ngo Dinh Diem group, Ngo Dinh Diem alone received "5,721,735" votes, more than two million more than the total number of "voters." According to Agence France-Presse, in Saigon and Cholon, there were only 400,000 voters, but the number of votes cast was 605,025. Reuters also reported that "in several towns, the votes exceeded the number of voters by 30 percent."

    The reason Ngo Dinh Diem was able to "overfulfill" his "referendum" was because he had made full preparations for an "orderly" vote. Sparse news leaking through a tight news blockade revealed that Ngo Dinh Diem had adopted a series of fascist terror measures to ensure his "victory," including holding so-called "National Army Week," "Petition Week," etc., to intimidate the residents of South Vietnam. On the day of the vote, Ngo Dinh Diem even forced residents to stop work and close their businesses, and used armed force to drive residents to vote for him. According to Agence France-Presse: Saigon "all activities have been stopped under government orders. 'Air Vietnam' has suspended flights for twenty-four hours. All shops are closed except for French restaurants." Even so, the majority of the South Vietnamese people refused to participate in this vote that violated the will of the people. Reuters reported: "Many of them were indifferent, while others disapproved of both Ngo Dinh Diem and Bao Dai." Under these circumstances, the Ngo Dinh Diem group hastily fabricated a large number of votes, resulting in the number of votes exceeding the number of voters, creating a nonsensical situation.

    Regarding this disgraceful farce, the U.S. State Department itself showed no less "efficiency" than the Ngo Dinh Diem group. The so-called election "results" announced by the Ngo Dinh Diem group were only fabricated on the evening of the 25th, but the U.S. State Department announced on the 24th that the Vietnamese people "had made a clear choice" and immediately "recognized Ngo Dinh Diem as the head of state."

    In this way, it is very clear that the reason Ngo Dinh Diem was able to appear so "efficient" was the result of the U.S. directing it "efficiently."

    It can be considered that the U.S. State Department's praise for Ngo Dinh Diem's "efficiency" is actually a self-boast of the U.S.'s "efficiency" in excluding France and undermining the Geneva Accords.

### 美国式的“效率”在南越

    美国式的“效率”在南越
    美国国务院对于吴庭艳自封为“总统”的一幕所谓“公民投票”滑稽戏感到非常“满意”，并且夸奖它“是以如此有秩序和有效率的方式进行的”。
    吴庭艳的有“效率”达到什么程度，只要对照一下几个数目字就明白了。据路透社报道，吴庭艳集团登记的“选民”人数是“三百五十万”，投票那天，“选民中约有百分之五十弃权”。可是，在吴庭艳集团宣布的所谓“正式结果”中，吴庭艳一人就得到了“五百七十二万一千七百三十五”票，比全部“选民”人数还多了二百多万。据法新社报道说，在西贡和堤岸，选民只有四十万人，而选举的票数却出现了六十万五千零二十五票。路透社也说，“在几个市镇里，选票超出了选民数目百分之三十”。
    吴庭艳所以能够“超额完成”他这场“公民投票”，是因为他给“有秩序”地投票进行了充分的准备。透过严密的新闻封锁所透露出来的零星消息表明，吴庭艳采取了一系列的法西斯恐怖措施来保证他的“胜利”，包括举行所谓“国民军周”、“请愿周”等等，向南越居民大施恫吓。投票那天，吴庭艳甚至强迫居民停工歇业，并施行武力威胁来驱赶居民去投他的票。据法新社报道：西贡市“在政府命令之下一切活动都已停止。‘越南航空公司’已停止飞行二十四小时。除了法国人的饭店以外，所有商店都关了门”。虽然如此，南越人民却大多数拒绝参加这场强奸民意的投票。路透社报道说：“其中许多人是漠不关心，其他的则对吴庭艳和保大两人都不赞成。”在这种情况下，吴庭艳集团在匆忙之中捏造了大量的选票数字，结果使得选票的数目超过了选民的数目，搞得牛头不对马嘴。
    对于这场丢丑的滑稽戏，美国国务院自己也表现了不亚于吴庭艳集团的“有效率”。吴庭艳集团公布的所谓选举“结果”，是在二十五日晚上才制造好的，美国国务院却在二十四日就宣布越南人民“已明白无误地作了选择”，并立即“承认吴庭艳是国家元首”。
    这样一来，事情就很清楚了，吴庭艳所以能够表现得有“效率”，是美国有“效率”地导演的结果。
    可以认为，美国国务院对于吴庭艳的“效率”的赞赏，实际上是对于美国在排挤法国和破坏日内瓦协议方面的“效率”的一种自我吹嘘。
