　　Economical and Practical Temporary Processing Plants
　　By our reporter Zhang Jianhong

　　In the vast area adjacent to the east side of the tractor factory, there is a cluster of neat bamboo structures. From afar, people can see the roofs covered with golden yellow straw mats and the smoking chimneys. These are the temporary processing plants serving the construction of the tractor factory, including a wood processing plant, a precast concrete component plant, a sanitary equipment material plant, a metal structure plant, and a foam cement plant.

　　These processing plants are large in scale and well-equipped. For example, the precast component plant is a factory that can accommodate two thousand workers, capable of processing various complex components for the construction of the tractor factory's buildings. Like other modern processing plants with different building material structures, the production process is largely mechanized. The removal of large products from molds and their storage are done using cranes. Each process in the production of each product is linked through the plant's narrow-gauge railway. The prefabrication workshop also has steam curing rooms for maintaining the components.

　　The use of bamboo structures in temporary construction projects is a practice that has been done for a long time in many areas south of the Yangtze River, but the scale was not large, and it was not used for factory buildings. When the construction unit of the tractor factory was preparing to use bamboo structures to build the processing plants, they considered the following issues: Could the bamboo structure processing plants survive the winter on the tractor factory's construction site? Could they be used for the expected number of years? They compared the local climate with that of Shanghai: the coldest midnight temperature in the local winter is minus twenty degrees Celsius, while the daytime temperature is generally around minus five degrees Celsius, while the coldest temperature in Shanghai is also minus five degrees Celsius (like last winter). Although the local midnight is colder than Shanghai, workers do not work at midnight, and the walls of the processing plant can be made of double-layered bamboo walls, coated with mud and lime, and the roof covered with straw mats. With careful attention to sealing doors and windows, the cold resistance is similar to that of a single-layer wooden or brick-and-wood wall. Although there is heavy snow in the local winter, and thick snow often accumulates and cannot melt in time, the roof trusses of the processing plant can be made of wood, and pillars can be installed where needed. In this way, the reinforced bamboo structure processing plant can withstand the pressure of snow accumulation. They also analyzed the main material required for the bamboo structure – bamboo, believing that bamboo's tensile and compressive strength are superior to wood, and it is very tough and not easily腐朽(fǔxiǔ: decay or rot), so it can be used for three to five years without any problems. If attention is paid to quality during construction and annual maintenance is carried out after each rainy season, its lifespan can be extended appropriately.

　　Bamboo is an inexpensive building material. Using bamboo structures to build processing plants can directly reduce project costs. The construction of the tractor factory's processing plants, by using bamboo structures, saved the state 380,000 yuan in investment. The project cost of the metal structure plant alone was reduced by 200,000 yuan compared to the original design budget, accounting for only half of the original design budget. If calculated by the cost per square meter, the original design of the Central Design Institute for a fully wooden structure processing plant was 68.9 yuan per square meter, the brick-and-wood structure processing plant at various construction sites was 54.74 yuan per square meter, while the bamboo structure processing plant of the tractor factory only cost 24.7 yuan per square meter. This is still a processing plant with a relatively complex structure. If it were a general temporary building, such as a warehouse or dormitory, the cost per square meter would only be 14 to 17 yuan, and the lowest would be only 8 yuan.

　　The tractor factory has used bamboo structures extensively in temporary construction projects. They not only successfully built technically complex bamboo structure processing plants, but also used bamboo to build dormitories, cafeterias, offices, and work sheds. In temporary construction projects, they saved the state a total of nearly 6 million yuan in investment. According to past statistics, temporary construction investment generally accounts for 5% of the total basic construction investment, while the temporary construction investment of the tractor factory only accounts for 2.16% of the total basic construction investment.

　　Using bamboo structures to build processing plants can also accelerate construction progress and save labor. Because bamboo is lighter than wood, easier to assemble, and convenient to transport, and the construction content is simple, construction can generally begin as soon as the general layout and overall design are available. Some simple temporary projects such as warehouses, dormitories, and cafeterias can even be constructed without design. Building a 200-square-meter temporary building using a brick-and-wood structure requires 20 laborers per day and takes 14 days to complete; while using a bamboo structure requires only 10 laborers per day and can be completed in 5 days. This facilitates the construction unit to quickly create new construction bases, allowing the construction team to quickly enter the site and start construction early. The processing plants of the tractor factory were able to be put into production on time precisely because they used bamboo structures, even when the Central Design Institute was late in submitting the drawings.

　　China is a country rich in bamboo resources. The Yangtze and Pearl River basins have high bamboo yields and high reproduction rates. If basic construction units in areas with suitable climates throughout the country can use bamboo to build temporary construction projects as much as possible, it will save the state a lot of investment and accelerate project progress. More importantly, it can save a large amount of valuable timber for use in permanent buildings.

    既经济又适用的临时加工厂
　　本报记者　张健虹
    在紧靠着拖拉机制造厂厂区东面的宽阔地带，有一簇整齐的竹结构建筑物。人们老远就可以看到那一片覆盖着金黄色草帘的屋顶和冒着烟的大烟囱。这便是为拖拉机制造厂施工服务的木材加工厂、混凝土预制构件厂、卫生设备材料厂、金属结构厂、泡沫水泥厂等临时加工厂。
    这些加工厂的规模宏大，设备完善。例如预制构件厂，就是一个可以容纳二千人工作的工厂，能为拖拉机制造厂的厂房施工加工出多种样式复杂的构件；跟其他近代化的别种建筑材料结构的加工厂一样，生产过程大部是机械化的。许多大型产品脱去模型和堆放，都是用吊车起重。每件产品制作中的各道工序，都是通过厂区轻便铁道来衔接的。在预制车间还设有养护构件的蒸气养护室。
    在基本建设的暂设工程中使用竹结构，在长江以南的许多地区早就这样做了，但规模不算大，而且没有用来做加工厂厂房。拖拉机制造厂的建筑单位在准备使用竹结构建筑加工厂时，曾考虑到这样一些问题：竹结构加工厂能不能在拖拉机制造厂工地上过冬？能不能使用到预期的年限？他们把当地的气候跟上海作了比较：当地冬季最冷的午夜气候是零下二十度，白天的气候一般都在零下五度，而上海气候最冷的时候也在零下五度（如去冬）。当地午夜虽然比上海冷，但工人并不在午夜里工作，而且加工厂的墙壁可用双层竹笆墙，墙上可涂上柴泥和石灰，屋顶盖上草帘，再注意严密门窗，隔寒能力跟一层木板墙或砖木结构单砖墙的差不多。当地冬季虽然雪大，而且常有很厚的积雪不能及时融化，但加工厂的屋架可以用木材做，需要安柱子的还可以安柱子。这样，经过加固的竹结构加工厂就可以抵抗积雪的压力。他们又对竹结构所需用的主要材料——竹材进行了分析，认为竹材抗拉、抗压强度都优于木材，而且韧性很大，不易腐朽，使用三、五年毫无问题。如果在施工中注意质量，每年雨季后进行一次保养，它的寿命还可以适当延长。
    竹材是价钱低廉的建筑材料。利用竹结构建筑加工厂可以直接降低工程成本。拖拉机制造厂加工厂的建筑，因为利用竹结构，就为国家节约了三十八万元投资，其中仅金属结构厂的工程造价就比原设计预算降低了二十万元，只占原设计预算的一半。如果以每平方公尺的造价来计算，中央设计院原设计的全木结构加工厂每平方公尺为六十八元九角，各基本建设工地的砖木结构加工厂每平方公尺为五十四元七角四分，而拖拉机制造厂的竹结构加工厂，每平方公尺只需要二十四元七角。这还是结构较复杂的加工厂，如果是一般的临时建筑，如仓库、宿舍等，每平方公尺造价只需要十四元到十七元，最低的只要八元。
    拖拉机制造厂在暂设工程中利用竹结构的范围是十分广泛的。他们不仅成功地建筑了技术要求较复杂的竹结构加工厂，而且还用竹材修建了宿舍、食堂、办公室、工作棚等。他们在暂设工程中，总共给国家节约了将近六百万元的投资。根据已往的统计资料，暂设工程投资一般都占基本建设总投资的百分之五，而拖拉机制造厂的暂设工程投资却只占基本建设总投资的百分之二点一六。
    利用竹结构建筑加工厂还可以加速施工进度和节省劳动力。因为竹材比木材轻，搭接容易，搬运也方便，加上施工内容简单，一般只要有了总平面布置和总体设计就可以施工，有些简单的仓库、宿舍、食堂等临时工程甚至不需要设计就可以施工。修建一座二百平方公尺的临时建筑物，如果采用砖木结构，每天要二十个劳动力，十四天才能完成；而采用竹结构，每天只需要十个劳动力，五天就可以完工。这样，就有利于施工单位迅速地创设新的建筑基地，使施工队伍很快进入现场，提早施工。拖拉机制造厂的加工厂，正是由于利用了竹结构，才在中央设计院迟交图纸的情况下，做到了按时投入生产。
    我国是盛产竹材的国家。长江和珠江流域竹的产量多，繁殖率高。如果全国气候适宜地区的基本建设单位都能尽量采用竹材建筑暂设工程，就会给国家节省很多投资和加速工程进度，更重要的是可以省出大批宝贵的木材用在永久性的建筑中去。
