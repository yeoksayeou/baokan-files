    When Chairman Mao's Instructions Meet the Masses
    By our reporter Zhu Bo

    Chairman Mao's instructions "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" have been published. This is a great happy event for the people of the whole country. The peasants of Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, are all encouraged and elated by these brilliant instructions. Here, there are sounds of gongs and drums and shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao" everywhere.

    On October 17th, the number of newspapers distributed in each district of Xianyang County was increased. Some newspapers were delivered to the peasants during the day, others at night. During the day, many peasants who were engaged in the busy autumn harvest returned to their villages to read the newspapers when they heard that the newspapers carrying Chairman Mao's instructions had arrived. This was the case with the peasants of Sunjia North Village in Pujia Township. When they heard that the newspapers had arrived, they stopped their autumn harvest work and hung Chairman Mao's portrait and Chairman Mao's instructions on the blackboard newspaper in the center of the village, surrounded by beautiful flowers. The peasants, their faces flushed with excitement, crowded around the blackboard newspaper, listening quietly as others read Chairman Mao's instructions. After listening to Chairman Mao's instructions, an old peasant shouted "Chairman Mao is here!" (Chairman Mao's instructions) "Socialism is here!" Another woman raised her baby high and cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Communist Party!"

    The peasants of Qicun Village in Chenma Township did not receive the newspapers until night. Some had already closed their doors and rested. When they heard that Chairman Mao's instructions had arrived, they quickly put on their clothes, carried lanterns, and gathered together, asking to read the newspaper again and again, forming an unprecedented mass rally. The peasants excitedly said: This is another great liberation!

    Many villages held mass meetings, grassroots cadre meetings, and agricultural producers' cooperative cadre meetings that night. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, they put forward requirements to re-plan the township's cooperative work, expand old cooperatives, and establish new cooperatives. After reading Chairman Mao's instructions, the cadres of Chenguang First Cooperative in Chenma Township happily said: Now we don't have to worry about running the cooperative well. They proposed: We must run the agricultural producers' cooperative well according to Chairman Mao's instructions. They studied ways to consolidate the cooperative and put forward suggestions for expanding it. The Pujia Township Party branch had not previously put forward a plan for the township to develop agricultural producers' cooperatives. After Chairman Mao's instructions were announced, they held a branch meeting overnight to formulate a plan for the township to develop agricultural producers' cooperatives. The original preliminary plan of the Yancun Township Party branch was to build three new agricultural producers' cooperatives this year, with the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 30 percent of the total number of households in the township. After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, they re-examined the situation in the township and put forward a new plan: to build eight new agricultural producers' cooperatives in the township this year, with the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives reaching more than 60 percent of the total number of households in the township. Baimiao North Village in Baimiao Township held a meeting of grassroots cadres and activists to read Chairman Mao's instructions and hold discussions. At the meeting, poor peasant Li Degui said: "I proposed building a cooperative a long time ago, but you (referring to the district and township cadres) didn't approve it, saying something about shrinking, not allowing us to run a cooperative. Actually, you were binding your own feet. Now Chairman Mao wants you to all let go and quickly lead the peasants to run cooperatives!"

    After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, the peasants of Xianyang County have further raised their awareness and are asking to establish cooperatives one after another. According to incomplete statistics, dozens of villages in the county are asking to establish cooperatives. Under the leadership of the Party branch, the peasants of Sunjia South Village study Chairman Mao's instructions every night. In these few days, except for one landlord household and one rich peasant household, all the other peasants in the village have asked to join the agricultural producers' cooperative. Xiaoyan Village has a total of 29 households, and 28 of them have expressed their willingness to join the agricultural producers' cooperative. The peasants of Zhang Zhenqun's mutual aid team and Chen Youcai's mutual aid team in Longzaoshu Village take time out every day to study Chairman Mao's instructions. These two teams have now formed a joint team, established a cooperative establishment committee, and 32 poor peasant households have already signed up to join the cooperative.

    当毛主席的指示和群众见面的时候
    本报记者　朱波
    毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的指示公布了。这是全国人民的大喜事。陕西咸阳县农民都为这一英明的指示而欢欣鼓舞。在这里，到处都是锣鼓声和欢呼“毛主席万岁”的声音。
    十月十七日这一天的报纸，咸阳县各区都增加了份数。报纸送到农民手里的时候，有的是在白天，有的是在夜里。在白天，很多正在进行紧张秋收的农民，听说登载毛主席指示的报纸来了，都跑回村里来看报。蒲家乡孙家北村的农民就是这样，当他们听说报纸来了，都停止了秋收工作，把毛主席的像和毛主席的指示挂在村中心的黑板报上，周围还挂上了美丽的花朵。兴奋得红了脸的农民们，都挤在黑板报旁边，静静地听别人读毛主席的指示。一个老农民听完毛主席的指示后，高呼“毛主席来了！”（毛主席的指示）“社会主义来了！”另一个妇女就高高举起娃娃，欢呼“毛主席万岁！”“共产党万岁！”
    陈马乡畦村的农民，在夜里才接到报纸，有些人已经关上大门休息了，他们听说毛主席的指示来了，很快都披上衣服，提着灯笼，集合在一起，一次又一次地要求读报，形成了一个空前规模的群众大会。农民们兴奋地说：这是又一次的大翻身！
    很多村庄都在这一天晚上开了群众大会、基层干部会和农业生产合作社干部会，根据毛主席的指示，提出了重新规划全乡合作化工作和扩大老社、建立新社的要求。陈马乡晨光一社的干部们阅读了毛主席的指示后，都高兴地说：这一下可不耽心合作社办不好了。他们提出：一定根据毛主席的指示办好农业生产合作社。他们研究了巩固合作社的办法，并提出了扩社的意见。蒲家乡党支部过去没有提出乡发展农业生产合作社的规划，毛主席指示公布后，就连夜召开支部大会制定全乡发展农业生产合作社的规划。岩村乡党支部原来的初步规划今年新建三个农业生产合作社，入社农户占全乡总农户的百分之三十。他们学习了毛主席的指示后，重新研究了全乡的情况，提出了新的规划：今年全乡新建八个农业生产合作社，入社农户达到全乡总农户的百分之六十以上。白庙乡白庙北村召开基层干部和积极分子会议，阅读毛主席的指示，并进行座谈。在会上，贫农李德贵说：“我老早就提议要建社，你们（指区、乡干部）不批准，说什么收缩哩，不叫办社，其实是你们自己裹住脚了，现在毛主席要你们都放开脚哩，赶快领导农民办社吧！”
    咸阳县农民在学习毛主席的指示以后，觉悟更加提高了，纷纷要求建社。据不完全的统计，全县有几十个村要求建社。孙家南村农民在党支部领导下，每天夜里学习毛主席的指示。就在这几天，全村除了一户地主、一户富农外，其他农民都要求参加农业生产合作社。小阎村共有二十九户，有二十八户表示愿意参加农业生产合作社。龙枣树村张振群互助组和陈友才互助组的农民，每天都抽出时间来学习毛主席的指示。这两个组现在已经成立了联组，成立了建社委员会，并已经有三十二户贫农报名入社。
