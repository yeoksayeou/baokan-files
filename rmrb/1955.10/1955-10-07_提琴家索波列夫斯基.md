    Violinist Rafal Sobolevsky of the Soviet Union was born in 1930 in the city of Kuibyshev, to a tailor’s family. His family members all loved music, and Rafal showed remarkable ear and extraordinary musical talent from a young age. At the age of five, he entered the violin class of the Kuibyshev Music School. Soon after, he moved to Moscow with his parents and entered the Central Children's Music School attached to the Moscow Conservatory, studying in the class of Professor Tsitlin, the most famous teacher in the Soviet Union. In 1948, he transferred to the Moscow Conservatory and graduated with honors in 1953 from Professor Tsyganov's class.

    As a university student, Rafal Sobolevsky participated in the Second World Youth Festival competition held in Budapest in 1949 (winning second prize), and in 1953 he won second prize again at the Jacques Thibaud and Marguerite Long International Violin and Piano Competition in Paris (the Soviet female violinist Nelli Shkolnikova won first prize). After the competition, Sobolevsky performed in Paris and achieved great success. His performances in Iceland, Denmark, Hungary, Greece, and Czechoslovakia were also very successful.

    Currently, Sobolevsky is engaged in extensive performance activities and is also improving his performance skills in the graduate school of the Moscow Conservatory.

    Sobolevsky's performance is characterized by grandeur and magnificence. He has a voice that is rich in emotion and beautiful in tone, as well as brilliant and developed skills. Sobolevsky's musical genius and performing talent enable him to perform a variety of programs. His performance of some classical violin works is unforgettable: Bach's violin solo scores, Brahms's and Beethoven's pieces, Tchaikovsky's "Melancholy Serenade," Schubert's "Ave Maria," and so on.

    When Sobolevsky performed in Budapest, a Hungarian newspaper commented on his performance: Sobolevsky's music is full of sincere and inspiring fire. He is good at expressing the world of emotions with a variety of techniques, from subtle sounds to courageous passion. Great and moving emotions make his performance vivid and powerful.

    提琴家索波列夫斯基
    苏联的青年提琴家拉法尔·索波列夫斯基一九三○年生于古比雪夫市一个裁缝的家里。他家里的人都喜爱音乐，拉法尔从小就显示出具有卓越的耳力和非凡的音乐才能。他五岁时就进入古比雪夫音乐学校的提琴班。不久，他随父母迁居莫斯科，又进入莫斯科音乐学院附属中央儿童音乐学校，跟随苏联最著名的教师齐特林教授的班学习。一九四八年他转到莫斯科音乐学院，并于一九五三年在齐干诺夫教授的班里以优良的成绩读完了音乐学院。
    在大学生时期，拉法尔·索波列夫斯基就参加了一九四九年在布达佩斯举行的第二届世界青年联欢节的比赛（获得二等奖），而在一九五三年巴黎举行的札·蒂博和玛格丽特·朗国际提琴和钢琴比赛中又获得二等奖（苏联女提琴家尼丽·什科里尼柯娃获得一等奖）。在比赛以后，索波列夫斯基曾在巴黎演奏，赢得了极大成功，他在冰岛、丹麦、匈牙利、希腊和捷克斯洛伐克的演奏也同样获得很大的成功。
    目前，索波列夫斯基从事大量的演奏活动，同时还在莫斯科音乐学院的研究院里提高自己的演奏技巧。
    索波列夫斯基的演奏以气魄伟大和风格壮丽为特色。他有感情丰富、音色很美的声音和辉煌发展的技艺。索波列夫斯基的音乐天才和演奏才能使他能够演奏各种节目。他对一些古典的提琴作品的演奏是令人难忘的：巴哈的提琴独奏乐谱，勃拉姆斯、贝多芬的乐曲，柴可夫斯基的“忧郁小夜曲”，舒伯特的“圣母颂”等。
    当索波列夫斯基在布达佩斯演奏时，匈牙利报纸曾就他的演奏评论说：索波列夫斯基的音乐里充满了热诚的、鼓舞人的火。他善于以多种手法来表现感情的世界，由细微的声音起直到勇敢的热情止。伟大的激动的感情使他的演奏生动和有力。
