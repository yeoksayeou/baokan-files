    Guangdong Province's Exports Increasing Daily

    The physical goods and charts at the export commodities exhibition and exchange fair currently being held in Guangzhou show that Guangdong Province is providing an increasing amount of export commodities to support the country's industrial construction.

    As people enter the gate of the exhibition and exchange fair, they can see more than fifty kinds of beautiful silk. The production of Guangdong raw silk, which has a long export history, will reach seven times that of 1950 this year, most of which is supplied for export. Guangdong has more than 300 kinds of handicrafts available for export and more than 100 kinds of industrial products. Among them, exquisite ivory carvings and Chaoshan drawnwork are very popular in the international market. Various fountain pens manufactured in Guangzhou, which began to be exported this year, have become popular in markets in Indonesia and Singapore. Guangdong's specialty cinnamon and rosin have now become best-selling commodities in the international market. Cinnamon has been sold to more than fifty regions and countries, and rosin has also been sold to more than twenty countries. Rosin exports in 1954 increased more than five times compared to 1950. In addition, South China's animal products, various subtropical fruits, and non-staple foods are also increasingly popular in the international market. From January to September this year, Guangdong's fruit exports increased by half compared to the same period last year.

    广东省出口商品日益增多
    广州市正在举行的出口物资展览交流会上的实物和图表显示：广东省为支援祖国的工业建设而提供的出口商品正日益增多。
    人们走进展览交流会的大门，就可以看到五十多种美丽的丝绸。具有悠久的出口历史的广东生丝，今年的产量将达到一九五零年的七倍，其中绝大部分供应出口。广东可供出口的工艺品已有三百多种，工业品有一百多种。其中如精美的象牙雕刻、潮汕抽纱等在国际市场上很受欢迎。今年开始出口的广州制造的各种自来水笔，已风行印度尼西亚和新加坡等地市场。广东特产桂皮和松香，目前已成为国际市场的畅销商品。桂皮销售地区已达五十多个地区和国家，松香也已行销二十多个国家。一九五四年出口的松香比一九五零年增加了五倍以上。此外，华南的畜产品以及各种亚热带水果和副食品，也日益受到国际市场的欢迎。今年一月到九月广东出口的水果比去年同期增加一半。
