The National Conference on Language Reform was held in the capital from October 15 to 23, 1955. Two hundred and seven representatives from twenty-eight provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and central government departments, military units, and people's organizations attended the conference. The conference heard and discussed the report "Language Must Be Reformed Under Certain Conditions" by Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Language Reform Committee, and the report "Vigorously Promote Mandarin Chinese with Beijing Pronunciation as the Standard Pronunciation" by Zhang Xiruo, Minister of Education of the People's Republic of China, and unanimously expressed their agreement.

The conference discussed the "Revised Draft of the Chinese Character Simplification Plan" and the "Draft of the First List of Variant Characters to be Standardized" submitted by the Chinese Language Reform Committee, and heard and discussed the "Report on the Work of Simplifying Chinese Characters" by Ye Gongchuo, Standing Committee Member. After making necessary revisions and additions to the "Revised Draft of the Chinese Character Simplification Plan," the conference unanimously expressed its agreement to the aforementioned documents.

After heated discussions, the conference recognized that Chinese characters must be reformed, and that the fundamental reform of Chinese characters should follow the common phonetic direction of world languages. At present, gradually simplifying Chinese characters and vigorously promoting Mandarin Chinese with Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation—the common language of the Han nationality—are in line with the urgent demands of the people of the whole country and the needs of China's socialist construction. In particular, promoting Mandarin Chinese will prepare important conditions for the fundamental reform of Chinese characters.

The conference resolved:

	1. To suggest that the Chinese Language Reform Committee submit the revised "Chinese Character Simplification Plan" to the State Council for examination, approval, and implementation.
	2. To require all newspapers and periodicals and cultural and educational institutions to widely publicize simplified Chinese characters; schools at all levels to use simplified Chinese characters; and publishing and printing institutions to immediately begin recasting copper molds, quickly adopt simplified Chinese characters, and abolish variant characters in publications in accordance with the List of Variant Characters to be Standardized.
	3. To require the Chinese Language Reform Committee to continue the work of simplifying Chinese characters and standardizing variant characters, and to continue to solicit opinions from the masses extensively, so as to complete the simplification and standardization of Chinese characters as soon as possible.
	4. To suggest that the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China first issue instructions to primary schools, middle schools, and normal schools at all levels across the country to vigorously promote Mandarin Chinese with Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation; and to instruct local educational administrative departments to train language teachers at all levels in batches to learn Mandarin Chinese in a planned way. Regarding the methods for promoting Mandarin Chinese in the military, it is suggested that the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army make a decision.
	5. To suggest that working committees for promoting Mandarin Chinese be established in all provinces and cities across the country to organize social forces, especially radio stations and cultural centers, to vigorously promote the learning and use of Mandarin Chinese.
	6. To suggest that the Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant universities cooperate to conduct a nationwide survey of dialects and compile textbooks and reference books for Mandarin Chinese to facilitate the learning of Mandarin Chinese by people in various dialect areas.
	7. To suggest that the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and relevant departments further promote horizontal typesetting of newspapers, magazines, and books. To suggest that state organs, military units, schools, and people's organizations promote horizontal typesetting and writing of official documents and letters.
	8. To suggest that the Chinese Language Reform Committee formulate a draft plan for a Chinese phonetic writing system as soon as possible and submit it to people from all walks of life across the country for discussion and trial use.
