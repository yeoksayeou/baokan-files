    Shaoxing Winery Trials Machine Production of Yellow Wine
    The famous Shaoxing yellow wine of Zhejiang has begun to be experimentally produced by machine.
    In the past, the production of Shaoxing yellow wine relied on natural climate fermentation and manual operation. In February 1954, the local state-owned Shaoxing Winery, with state investment, carried out basic construction and began installing machinery and equipment. By August of the same year, machinery and equipment such as refrigeration units for fermentation, fermentation tanks, mixing machines, and boilers for steaming wine had been fully installed. In September of this year, trials began on using machines to produce yellow wine.
    There are many advantages to producing yellow wine with machines. In the past, every summer and autumn, due to the hot weather, the fermentation rate of bacterial reproduction was very strong, and it could not be controlled manually. Therefore, yellow wine production could only be carried out in spring and winter each year. Now, with machines and refrigeration equipment, the climate and temperature can be strictly controlled by the machines. The fermentation and mixing of wine-making materials are no longer dependent on natural climate changes or manual operating experience. In this way, not only can production be carried out all year round, but the quality of the wine produced is also better. According to the results of this machine-made wine experiment, the alcohol content of each jin of yellow wine reached 18.8 percent, an increase of 4.8 percent compared to the past. Machine production can also greatly shorten production time. In the past, manual operation of winemaking took more than two months from fermentation to finished product, but now it only takes 18 days. Fully adopting machine winemaking will also significantly reduce the cost of yellow wine. (Shao Zhizhong)

    绍兴酒厂试用机器生产黄酒
    闻名的浙江绍兴黄酒，已开始试验用机器生产。
    过去，绍兴黄酒的生产都是靠自然气候发酵和人工进行操作。一九五四年二月，地方国营绍兴酒厂在国家投资下，进行了基本建设，开始安装机器设备，到同年八月，发酵用的冷气机、发酵池、捣拌机和蒸酒用的锅炉等机器设备等已全部装置好。今年九月间，开始试验用机器生产黄酒。
    用机器生产黄酒优点很多。过去，每逢夏秋季节，因天气炎热，菌类繁殖发酵率很强，人工不能控制，因此，每年黄酒的生产只有在春季和冬季才能进行。现在有了机器和冷气设备后，气候、温度完全可以由机器来严格控制，制酒原料的发酵和捣拌，也再不靠自然气候的变化和凭人工操作经验进行了。这样，不但可以全年地进行生产，而且，做出来的酒的质量还好。根据这次机器制酒试验结果，每斤黄酒含酒精成分达到百分之十八点八，比过去提高了百分之四点八。用机器生产还能大大缩短生产时间。过去手工操作制酒，从发酵到制成成品要两个多月，现在只需要十八天。全面改用机器制酒，黄酒成本也将显著降低。（邵治中）
