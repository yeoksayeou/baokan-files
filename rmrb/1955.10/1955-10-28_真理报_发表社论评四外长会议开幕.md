Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th: "Pravda" published an editorial on the 27th, commenting on the opening of the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

    The editorial stated that strengthening and developing the "Geneva spirit," seeking methods to resolve unresolved international issues to promote trust between nations, further ease international tensions, and consolidate peace—these are the tasks facing the Foreign Ministers Conference. There are great and favorable opportunities, but also certain difficulties, in the path of completing this task.

    The three months since the Geneva Four Government Heads Conference have shown that the "Geneva spirit" has been supported by all peace-loving people.

    Major international events (the center of which, as everyone recognizes, is Moscow) have provided vivid examples of the fruitful development of the "Geneva spirit"—the spirit of cooperation between nations for the sake of peace.

    Due to the same interests of easing international tensions and strengthening the "Geneva spirit," the People's Republic of China has taken a series of measures in diplomatic affairs, and the People's Republic of China is continuing to strive to resolve outstanding issues with the United States and strengthen peace and security in the Far East. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Albania have reduced their armed forces. India, Burma, and Indonesia have repeatedly expressed opposition to the war preparations carried out by military blocs in Southeast Asia. Yugoslavia and other countries have made positive contributions to the consolidation of peace.

    The editorial pointed out that the desire to further ease international tensions has unfortunately not become a universal desire. The blatant remarks of some prominent figures in Western countries show that some people in these countries have not given up their harmful illusions and still believe that they can achieve their goals by relying on the "position of strength" policy. This attitude shows that some people have lost their sense of reality and do not want to consider the fact that the "position of strength" policy only brings failure.

    The editorial stated that the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference must discuss effective measures to resolve major international issues. On the issue of guaranteeing security for all of Europe, the Soviet Union is deeply convinced that only by ceasing to pursue the policy of military alliances, and only by all European countries and the United States working together to strive for peace, can the true security of European countries be guaranteed and must be guaranteed. The reunification of Germany is directly dependent on the solution of the issue of security for all of Europe. Therefore, it is even more perplexing that representatives of some Western countries are now trying to raise the issue in the opposite way, as if the solution of the security issue depends on the solution of the German issue.

    Practical progress in resolving the disarmament issue is of paramount importance to the successful resolution of the European security issue and the German issue. As everyone knows, the four countries have agreed on many important aspects of this issue, and it is only the obstruction of representatives of certain countries that has prevented the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission from making progress.

    Resolving the issue of developing exchanges between East and West in accordance with the interests of the people of all countries is extremely important. Some things have already been done in this regard, but all the possibilities have not yet been fully explored.

    The editorial concluded by saying that if the Foreign Ministers Conference follows the path of strengthening and developing the "Geneva spirit," if all its participants show due willingness to seek decisions that are in line with the interests of easing international tensions, strengthening peace, and the security of the people of all countries, and that can be accepted by everyone, then it can complete the tasks set by the Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Countries.

### “真理报”发表社论评四外长会议开幕

    “真理报”发表社论评四外长会议开幕
    新华社二十七日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”二十七日发表社论，评日内瓦苏、美、英、法四国外长会议开幕。
    社论说，加强和发展“日内瓦精神”，寻求解决还没有解决的国际问题的方法以促进各国之间的信任，进一步缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平——这些就是外长会议所面临的任务。在完成这项任务的道路上有很大的有利的机会，但也有某些困难。
    日内瓦四国政府首脑会议以来的三个月表明，“日内瓦精神”受到了一切爱好和平人民的支持。
    重大的国际事件（如大家所公认的，其中心是莫斯科）提供了“日内瓦精神”——各国之间为了和平而进行合作的精神——富有成果的发展的鲜明榜样。
    由于同样的缓和国际紧张局势和加强“日内瓦精神”的利益，中华人民共和国在外交事务方面采取了一些措施，中华人民共和国正在继续努力，谋求同美国解决悬而未决的问题和加强远东的和平和安全。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利和阿尔巴尼亚裁减了它们的武装部队。印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚一再表示反对东南亚的军事集团所进行的战争准备。南斯拉夫和其他国家对和平的巩固作出了肯定的贡献。
    社论指出，要求进一步缓和国际紧张局势的愿望不幸还没有成为普遍的愿望。西方国家一些著名人物的露骨言论表明，这些国家的某些人士还没有放弃他们的有害的幻想，仍然以为可能凭借“实力地位”政策来达到他们的目的。这种态度表明，有些人已经丧失了现实感，他们不想考虑“实力地位”政策只有带来失败的这一事实。
    社论说，日内瓦外长会议必须讨论解决重大国际问题的有效措施。在保障全欧安全的问题上，苏联深信，只有停止奉行军事联盟的政策，只有一切欧洲国家以及美国共同努力为争取和平而斗争，欧洲国家的真正安全才能够而且一定能够得到保证。德国的重新统一直接有赖于全欧安全问题的解决。因此，某些西方国家代表现在力图把问题提得正相反，好像安全问题的解决有赖于德国问题的解决似的，这就更加令人不解了。
    在解决裁军问题方面的实际进展，对顺利解决欧洲安全问题和德国问题具有头等重要意义。大家知道，四国在这个问题的许多重要方面的意见都是一致的，仅仅是某些国家代表们进行的阻挠才使得联合国裁军委员会小组委员会未能取得进展。
    按照各国人民的利益解决发展东西方之间的往来问题是极其重要的。在这方面已经做了一些事情，但是还没有充分探讨全部的可能性。
    社论最后说，如果外长会议遵循加强和发展“日内瓦精神”的道路，如果它的所有参加者都显示应有的欣然态度来寻求符合缓和国际紧张局势、加强和平和各国人民安全的利益的、可以为大家共同接受的决定，那末它就能完成四国政府首脑日内瓦会议所规定的任务。
