The Creatively Rich Michurin Biology
Vice President of North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, Zu Deming

October 27th of this year marks the centenary of the birth of the great natural reformer, I.V. Michurin. Biologists and agronomists in the Soviet Union-led peaceful democratic camp, as well as progressive scientists in other countries, will commemorate this scientific giant who opened up infinite prospects for mankind's happy life.

The Michurin biology created by Michurin is a further development of Darwinism. Through sixty years of diligent and unremitting work, Michurin revealed many previously unknown universal laws regarding the growth and development of organisms, designed many effective scientific technologies for creating new plant types, and cultivated over three hundred varieties of fruit trees and berries. Michurin's great contribution is unprecedented.

Due to the establishment of the Michurin biology, the Mendelian-Morgan theory, which had dominated biological science for many years, was thoroughly destroyed, and biologists and agronomists were shown the path they should take, so that they would no longer wander aimlessly and waste valuable energy, time, and property. The most basic principle of Michurin biology is that organisms and their living conditions are an indivisible unity. Although this phenomenon was discovered earlier by Lamarck and Darwin, Lamarck's explanation of this phenomenon contained many idealistic elements. Darwin's understanding, although greatly improved compared to Lamarck's, also had erroneous parts. Only Michurin, with a large amount of experimental research results, gave a perfect dialectical materialist explanation of the relationship between organisms and living conditions. The significant meaning of Michurin biology lies not only in its scientific explanation of the relationship between organisms and living conditions, but also in its investigation of the causes of variation. Michurin biology points out that in order to live, organisms must constantly carry out metabolism, and to carry out metabolism, they must assimilate external conditions. After external conditions are assimilated, they become internal factors, that is, they become part of the organism. Therefore, each component of an organism, for its own growth and development, inevitably requires all the external conditions that previously constituted it. Therefore, in Michurin biology, the phenomenon of heredity is seen as the combination of the organism's heritability and the external conditions it needs, rather than the result of a special substance (chromosome or gene) controlling it. Michurin biology believes that heritability is the characteristic of an organism needing certain conditions for its life and development, and also the characteristic of an organism reacting to these or those conditions in a certain way. From this, it is not difficult to understand that when the external conditions required for the normal growth and development of an organism are appropriately changed artificially, the organism will undergo variation due to the assimilation of new external conditions, and due to the difference in the new external conditions, the variation will also be different. Based on these circumstances, Michurin created the method of directed breeding of organisms. The method of directed breeding created by Michurin enables humans to create new plant types according to their own needs. From then on, biological science moved from explaining nature to transforming nature, pushing Darwinism to a higher stage.

Based on the above principles, Michurin also discovered the stages of plant development. Later, Academician Lysenko, under this important inspiration, established the theory of plant stage development. This theory tells people that the entire period from sowing to the maturation of new seeds in annual plants does not require the same external conditions, but requires different external conditions according to the different stages of growth. For example, autumn-sown crops require a comprehensive condition mainly based on a certain low temperature condition in the initial stage of development. When the stage requiring low temperature is completed, it requires a comprehensive condition mainly based on a certain light condition. At this time, high temperature becomes an important condition again. According to Academician Lysenko's research, the former is the vernalization stage, and the latter is the photoperiod stage. Before the former stage is completed, the latter stage cannot begin. Moreover, this characteristic of stage development varies in different degrees depending on the species and variety of plants. This difference is formed in the process of historical development, so even the same crop varies due to the different natural conditions of the variety's origin.

The discovery of the laws of plant stage development not only enables people to know that plant development is composed of various heterogeneous stages, but also provides extremely important references for the selection of hybrid parents and the formulation of cultivation techniques. Moreover, the vernalization method for spring-sown crops researched based on this theory has played a significant role in production.

The conservatism and lability of heredity were also researched by Michurin. Michurin, based on a large number of facts, found that wild species and old varieties have the strongest conservatism of heredity, and their heredity has a strong ability to transmit. From a plant's perspective, the self-rooted nutrition part has a greater ability to transmit heredity than the non-self-rooted nutrition part. From a variety's perspective, the younger the age, the smaller the conservatism, the more suitable the living conditions, the stronger the development, the greater the conservatism. The heredity of hybrids, however, is labile, more plastic, and more susceptible to external conditions. Michurin's method of acclimatization is based on this principle. He believed that if a variety is to survive in areas with very different climates, it must be gradually cultivated by sowing hybrid seeds. Michurin himself and his successors have used this method to extend certain fruit trees and crops from the south to the remote north.

The dominance law revealed by Michurin is a further development of the above theory. If this law can be mastered and the relative relationship between the hereditary conservatism and lability of hybrid parents can be appropriately controlled, and good conditions are given for the development of the desired characteristics and traits in the hybrid embryo and after the embryonic period, the hybrid can be developed with the characteristics and traits we desire, weakening or completely eliminating those characteristics and traits we do not desire. It can be seen that this law is not only very useful for creating new plant types, but also indicates that the Mendelian-Morgan school's disregard for the cultivation conditions of hybrids and its mechanical division of characteristics and traits into recessive and dominant is completely wrong.

Michurin biology greatly advanced the theory of fertilization and its selectivity. It revealed that the fertilization process is a physiological process and a process of mutual assimilation of gametes; at the same time, it has selectivity in the fertilization process. In the case of natural pollination of plants, the maternal plant always selects the most suitable pollen for fertilization in order to produce offspring that are similar to itself and have strong vitality. It also revealed that this ability of selective fertilization varies depending on the species, age, and external conditions of the maternal plant. Generally, the more conservative the heredity, the smaller the range of selection; the more labile the heredity, the wider the range of selection. From the perspective of pollen (sperm in animals), the greater the quantity, the greater the number and species of paternal plants, the wider the range of selection for the maternal plant. Michurin and his successors created the methods of mixed pollination within varieties, mixed pollination between varieties, and distant hybridization based on these principles, on the one hand maintaining the heritability of the maternal variety, and on the other hand improving its vitality. According to the analysis of Michurin biology, the reason why the mixed pollination method can improve the vitality of the variety is not only due to the selection effect, but also because the combination of two different sex cells will form contradictions in the offspring organism. The formation of this contradiction comes from the combination of one egg cell and one male cell (strictly speaking, this is a sperm nucleus), and also from the role of many other male cells participating in the fertilization process (the latter can be proved by the fact that distant hybridization can both improve vitality and maintain the characteristics of the maternal variety). The reason why mixed pollination between varieties can also maintain the heritability of the maternal variety is partly due to the pre-selection of the paternal variety based on the characteristics and traits of the maternal variety, and partly due to the selection effect of the pollen by the maternal variety during the fertilization process.

However, the Mendelian-Morgan school simply believes that such a profound fertilization process is a random combination of sex cells. Therefore, they cannot give a correct explanation for the degradation phenomenon of varieties, let alone propose a solution. On the contrary, based on their argument, they set the maintenance of the purity of varieties as the only goal, and formulated various unreasonable agricultural technical regulations, which often accelerate the degradation of excellent varieties and cause losses in production.

Whether grafting can produce hybrids is a question that has been debated in the biological community for many years. Although Darwin and Timiryazev had made correct expositions on this issue, the establishment of the theory of vegetative hybrids should be attributed to Michurin and Lysenko. Michurin first confirmed the certainty of hereditary variation caused by grafting with a large number of experimental results, and pointed out the reasons why many scholars could not obtain hybrids. According to Michurin's research, in order to obtain vegetative hybrids, first, scions must be taken from plants that are still in the young stage of development; second, the rootstock should be relatively old; third, a large number of branches on the rootstock near the scion must be allowed to grow, while reducing the leaves on the scion, so that the root system and leaves of the rootstock can work together. This is the principle established by Michurin for vegetative hybridization. However, many scholars did not understand these principles when conducting this research. The scions they used were mostly taken from old varieties of plants that had been bearing fruit for many years. The heredity of such scions was very conservative and lacked plasticity, making it difficult to accept the influence of the rootstock. The rootstocks they used were almost all young plants, and their hereditary transmission power was not strong. If the heredity of the scion had reached a stable state, the scion would not easily accept the influence of the rootstock. If the hereditary transmission power of the scion was greater than that of the rootstock, the rootstock would instead accept the influence of the scion. Secondly, after grafting was successful, they did not apply any treatment to force one of the grafting parents to accept the influence of the other parent. Therefore, it was inevitable that they would not get vegetative hybrids.

The famous mentoring method created by Michurin is based on the principle of vegetative hybridization. The role of the mentoring method is to change the heredity of one parent to accept the influence of the other parent through the exchange of plastic substances. Michurin skillfully used this method to create and improve many varieties of fruit trees.

The principle of vegetative hybridization established by Michurin and Lysenko has extremely important significance both in agricultural production and in scientific theory. Because two distantly related plant species or genera that cannot obtain hybrids by sexual hybridization can generally produce hybrids by vegetative hybridization, and through the process of vegetative hybridization, two parents that could not originally produce hybrids by sexual hybridization can become possible, which greatly expands the possibility of creating new plant types. More importantly, the production of hybrids by vegetative hybridization clearly points out that hybrids can also be produced without the combination of chromosomes of two hybrid parents. This gives a fatal blow to the so-called chromosome inheritance theory of the Mendelian-Morgan school and liberates people from idealistic and metaphysical speculation.

The above-mentioned method of first performing vegetative hybridization to bring the heredity of two parents closer in order to make sexual hybridization of two distantly related types possible is the pre-vegetative approach method created by Michurin to overcome the incompatibility of distantly related types. Michurin also created some other methods to overcome the incompatibility of distantly related types. First, he believed that it is necessary to select parent materials with labile heredity, such as selecting the youngest hybrid plants or using types from distant origins for hybridization to break their hereditary conservatism. Among Michurin's many methods is a mediator method, which was created for two distantly related types that cannot be directly hybridized. The method is to first select an intermediate type that is somewhat close to both parents, hybridize it with one of the parents to obtain hybrids, and then hybridize this hybrid with the other parent to produce the desired distant hybrids. Michurin also used the mixed pollination method to overcome the incompatibility of distantly related types. This method is to mix pollen from the maternal plant or pollen similar to the maternal type into the pollen of the distantly related paternal parent to make them interact with each other and produce a physiological stimulation effect, promoting the fertilization of the distantly related paternal pollen. Secondly, based on many years of careful research, Michurin also discovered the fact that the effects of pollen from a plant type in the fertilization process vary due to the different times of production and the different external environmental conditions, thereby creating the multiple repeated pollination method. Because this method increases the opportunity for distantly related paternal pollen to fertilize under favorable conditions, it is also one of the methods to overcome the incompatibility of distantly related types.

In addition to creating many effective methods to overcome the incompatibility of distantly related types, Michurin also created many measures for the infertility of distant hybrids. For example, selecting appropriate pollination plants, mixing pollen from different plants for mixed pollination, providing the most suitable nutritional conditions, enabling the mentoring effect of the rootstock, and extending the age of perennial hybrids, using asexual reproduction methods or delaying the formation of reproductive organs for annual hybrids, etc., can gradually harmonize the physiological functions of the hybrid, thereby gradually improving the fruit setting rate.

Overall, Michurin biology has unparalleled creativity in theory and method, and because these theories and methods are all for the purpose of production practice, or created in production practice, they have invincible power to improve production practice. Everyone knows that Michurin created more than three hundred new varieties of fruit trees and berries by himself, and pushed the cultivation boundary of certain fruit trees hundreds of kilometers north, which is an unprecedented miracle in agricultural history. After Michurin's death, under the leadership of Academician Lysenko, the outstanding successor of Michurin's cause, more excellent varieties were created in crops, vegetables, and fruit trees, and certain plant species were pushed to even more remote northern regions; there were even more brilliant achievements in agricultural technology. After Michurin biology was widely applied, the yield per unit area of certain crops has reached or exceeded the highest level in the world from the low yield of many years. Not only that, Michurin biology has also achieved good results in improving animal husbandry and other related undertakings. All of these provide an extremely powerful guarantee for the high and stable yields of the Soviet Union. In this way, Michurin biology follows dialectical materialism, determines theory through practice; creates methods based on theory; applies methods and improves practice; so that the three elements of practice, theory, and method can be closely interdependent and constantly promote each other, so that the content of Michurin biology can be rapidly enriched and developed. Finally, it should be pointed out that Michurin biology has been fully introduced to our country and has become the leading force in our agricultural science for only a few years, but it has had a huge impact on transforming the relationship between agricultural science and production practice in our country, and it has played an unprecedented role in enabling agricultural scientists to improve agricultural production in our country. It is undeniable that Michurin biology has pushed agricultural science in our country to a new historical stage. Therefore, we believe that the creatively rich Michurin biology is the most reliable and effective scientific weapon for developing socialist agriculture in our country. We must further strengthen its study and application so that Michurin biology can be deeply implemented into agricultural production, so that our biological science and agricultural science can adapt to the needs of socialist construction in our country.

    充满创造性的米丘林学说
    华北农业科学研究所副所长　祖德明
    今年十月二十七日，是伟大的自然改造者伊·弗·米丘林诞生一百周年纪念日。以苏联为首的和平民主阵营内各个国家的生物学家和农学家们，以及其他国家进步的科学家们，都将纪念这位为人类的美满生活开辟了无限前程的科学巨人。
    为米丘林所创立的米丘林学说是达尔文主义进一步的发展。米丘林用自己六十年勤恳不懈的劳动，对于有机体的生长和发育揭明了许多前所未知的普遍规律，在创造植物新类型方面设计了许多行之有效的科学技术，实地培育出了三百个以上的果树和浆果类品种。米丘林的巨大贡献是史无先例的。
    由于米丘林学说的创立，把多少年来在生物科学上占统治地位的孟德尔—摩尔根学说的理论彻底摧毁了，并为生物学家和农学家们指出了所应走的道路，从此不致再在歧路上徘徊不定，大量地浪费宝贵的精力、时间和财产了。米丘林学说最基本的原理是生物体与其生活条件是不可分割的统一体。这种现象虽然早被拉马克和达尔文所发现，但拉马克对于这种现象的解释却有不少的唯心成分。达尔文比拉马克的见解虽大大提高了一步，但也有错误部分。只有到了拥有大量试验研究结果的米丘林，才对生物体与生活条件间的关系，给予了完善的辩证唯物主义的阐明。米丘林学说的重大意义除了在于它能科学地解释生物体与生活条件之间的关系，还在于它究明了变异发生的原因。米丘林学说指出，生物体为了生活，必须不断地进行新陈代谢作用，而进行新陈代谢作用就必须同化外界条件，外界条件被同化了之后，便成了内部因素，也就是变成了生物体的一部分。所以生物体各个组成部分为了本身的生长和发育，必然要求那些以前构成其本身的所有外界条件。所以生物的遗传现象在米丘林学说看来，乃是生物遗传性和其所需外界条件的结合，并不是一种特殊物质（染色体或基因）支配的结果。米丘林学说认为遗传性就是有机体为了自己的生活和发育需要一定的条件的特性，同时也是有机体对于这些或那些条件发生一定反应的特性。由此不难理解，当人为地把生物体为了其正常的生长发育所要求的外界条件加以适当的变更之后，该生物体便会因同化了新的外界条件而发生变异，而且由于新的外界条件的不同，所发生的变异也会不同。根据这些情况，米丘林便创造了生物定向培育的方法。米丘林所创造的定向培育的方法，使得人类可以按照自己的需要，创育植物新类型，从此生物科学便从解释自然达到了改造自然的境地，把达尔文主义推进到了一个更高的阶段。
    在上述原理的基础上，米丘林又发现了植物发育的阶段性。后来李森科院士在这种重要的启示下创立了植物阶段发育的理论。这个理论告诉人们，一年生植物从播种到新种子成熟这一整个期间，并不是要求同一的外界条件，而是按着生长时期先后的不同，分别要求不同的外界条件。例如秋播作物在发育初期要求以一定低温条件为主的综合条件，当要求低温的阶段完成后，便要求以一定光照条件为主的综合条件，此时高温又变成了重要的条件。按李森科院士的研究，前者为春化阶段，后者为光照阶段，在前一阶段未完成以前，后一个阶段便不能开始。而且这种阶段发育特性因植物种类和品种不同，也有不同程度的差异，这种差异是在历史发展过程中形成的，所以同一种作物，也因品种原产地自然条件的不同而有差异。
    植物阶段发育规律的发现，不仅使人们知道植物的发育是由各个异质性的阶段组成的，对于杂交亲本的选择，对于栽培技术的规定，提供了极其重要的参考，而且依据这个理论所研究出来的春播作物的春化法，在生产上已起了重大的作用。
    关于遗传性的保守性和动摇性也是米丘林研究出来的。米丘林根据大量事实究明，野生种和老龄品种遗传性的保守性最强，它们的遗传性具有较强的传递能力。从一个植株上说，自根营养的部分比非自根营养部分遗传的传递能力大。从一个品种来说，年龄越幼，保守性越小，生活条件越适合，发育越健壮，保守性越大。而杂种的遗传性则是动摇的，可塑性较大，容易接受外界条件的影响。米丘林的风土驯化法就是根据这个道理创造出来的。他认为若使一个品种在风土气候相差很大的地区得以生存，必须采用播种杂种种子的方法逐渐培育。米丘林本人及其后继者们就利用这种方法把南方的某些果树和作物扩展到了遥远的北方。
    米丘林所揭露的显性规律是上述理论进一步的发展。如果能够掌握这种规律，恰当地控制杂交亲本遗传保守性和动摇性的相对关系，并在杂种胚期及胚期以后给予所希望的特征特性的发展以良好的条件，便可以使杂种发展我们所希望的特征和特性，削弱或完全消除我们所不希望的那些特征和特性。由此可见，这个规律不仅对于创造植物新类型是非常有用的，同时也在指明，孟德尔—摩尔根学派漠视杂种的培育条件，机械地把特征特性分为隐性和显性是完全错误的。
    米丘林学说对受精过程及其选择性的理论大大地推进了一步。它揭明了受精过程乃是生理学的过程，也是两性细胞相互同化的过程；同时在受精过程中具有选择性。在植物自然传粉的情况下，母本植株为了产生同自己相似的和生活力强的后代，总是挑选对自己最合适的花粉来受精。还揭明了这种选择受精的能力，因母本植株的种类、年龄和所处外界条件的不同，也有不同的表现。一般遗传保守性大的，选择的范围小，动摇性大的，选择的范围广。从花粉（在动物为精子）方面说，数量越多，父本株数和种类越多，则母本植株选择的范围也越大。米丘林及其后继者们就根据这些原理创造了品种内混合授粉法，品种间混合授粉法及远缘混合授粉法，一方面保持母本品种的遗传性，同时提高它的生活力。用混合授粉法之所以能提高品种的生活力，据米丘林学说的分析，除了选择的作用以外，还在于两种有差异的性细胞相结合之后，会形成后代生物体内的矛盾性，而这种矛盾性的形成，一方面来自一个卵细胞和一个雄性细胞（严格说，这是一个精核）的相结合，一方面也来自参与受精过程的其他许多雄性细胞的作用（后一点用远缘混合授粉法既可提高生活力，又可以保持母本品种的性状即可证明）。用品种间混合授粉法之所以也能保持母本品种的遗传性，一方面由于事先对父本品种已按母本品种的特征特性进行了选择，另一方面也在于母本品种在受精过程中对花粉的选择作用。
    但是，孟德尔—摩尔根学派对于这样深奥的受精过程却简单地认为是两性细胞偶然的结合，因而他们对于品种的退化现象不能给以正确的解释，更不能提出解决的办法，相反地却根据他们的论点，以保持品种的纯度为唯一目标，制定种种不合理的农业技术规程，其结果常常是加速优良品种的退化，造成生产上的损失。
    关于嫁接能不能产生杂种，是多年来生物学界争论不休的问题。对于这个问题，达尔文和季米里亚捷夫虽曾作过正确的阐述，但无性杂种理论的确立则应归功于米丘林和李森科。米丘林首先以大量的试验结果证实了因嫁接而引起遗传性变异的确实性，并指出了许多学者不能获得杂种的原因。据米丘林的研究，要想获得无性杂种，第一、必须从发育阶段还在幼龄的植株上采取接穗；第二、砧木应该是比较老龄的；第三、必须使接穗附近所有砧木上的枝条大量生长，同时减少接穗上的叶子，以使砧木的根系和叶子共同发生作用。这就是米丘林对于无性杂交所确定的原理。但是许多学者在进行这项研究时，却不懂得这些原理，他们所用的接穗多是从老龄品种业已结果数年以上的植株上采取的，这样的接穗的遗传性已很保守，缺少可塑性，很难接受砧木的影响；他们所用的砧木差不多都是幼龄植株，它的遗传传递力还不强，如果接穗的遗传性已达到稳定的状态，接穗便不容易接受砧木的影响，如果接穗的遗传传递力大于砧木，砧木反会接受接穗的影响。其次，他们在嫁接成活以后，不再施加任何处理来迫使嫁接亲本之一，接受另一亲本的影响。所以他们得不到无性杂种是势所必然的。
    米丘林所创造的有名的蒙导法，就是以无性杂交的原理为基础的。蒙导法的作用就在于通过可塑性物质的交流，使一亲本接受另一个亲本的影响而发生遗传性上的改变。米丘林曾经巧妙地应用这个方法创造和改良了许多果树的品种。
    由米丘林和李森科所确立的无性杂交原理，不论在农业生产上或在科学理论上都有极其重大的意义。因为用有性杂交法不能获得杂种的两个远缘植物种或属，一般用无性杂交法可以产生杂种，而且通过无性杂交的过程，又会使本来不能用有性杂交产生杂种的两个亲本，变为可能，这就大大地扩大了创造植物新类型的可能性。更重要的是，用无性杂交的方法产生杂种十分清楚地指出，不通过两个杂交亲本染色体的结合也可以产生杂种，这一点给予了孟德尔—摩尔根学派所谓染色体遗传理论以致命的打击，把人们从唯心的、形而上学的臆说中解放了出来。
    上述为了使两个远缘类型的有性杂交成为可能，先进行无性杂交以使两个亲本的遗传性相接近的方法，乃是米丘林为了克服远缘类型不可交配性所创造的预先无性接近法。米丘林对于克服远缘类型的不可交配性还创造了另外的一些方法。首先，他认为必须选择遗传性动摇的亲本材料，例如选取最幼龄的杂种植株，或采用原产地相距遥远的类型进行杂交，以打破其遗传保守性。在米丘林的许多方法中有一媒介法，这是为两个不能直接进行杂交的远缘类型而创造的，其法就是先选择一个与两个亲本都有些接近的中间类型，使其与亲本之一进行杂交以获得杂种，然后再以此杂种和另一亲本杂交，以产生所希望的远缘杂种。米丘林对于克服远缘类型的不可交配性还有混合授粉法，这个方法就是在远缘父本的花粉中混加母本植株的花粉或与母本类型相近的花粉，以使其相互影响，发生生理上的刺激作用，促成远缘父本花粉的授精。其次，米丘林根据多年仔细的研究，还发现了一种植物类型的花粉由于产生时间早晚的不同，以及由于外界环境条件的不同，在受精过程中所发生的作用也有差异的事实，从而创造了多次重复授粉法，这个方法因为增加了使远缘父本花粉能在有利条件下授精的机会，也是克服远缘类型不可交配性的方法之一。　　米丘林除在克服远缘类型的不可交配性方面创造了许多有效的方法外，对于远缘杂种的不孕性也创造了不少的措施。譬如，选配适当的授粉植株，采取不同植株上的花粉进行混合授粉，给以最适宜的营养条件，使受砧木的蒙导作用，以及延续多年生杂种的年龄，对一年生杂种利用无性繁殖法或延缓其生殖器官的形成等等方法，都可以使杂种的生理机能逐渐调和，从而结实性得以逐渐提高。
    综观上述，米丘林学说在理论上和在方法上都有着丰富无比的创造，而且这些理论和方法由于都是为了生产实践的目的，或是在生产实践中创造出来的，对于生产实践的改进，都具有无坚不摧的威力。大家晓得，经米丘林一人之手便创造了三百个以上的果树和浆果类新品种，并把某些果树的栽培界限向北推移了数百公里以上，这在农业史上是空前未有的奇迹。米丘林逝世后，米丘林事业在卓越的继承者李森科院士的领导下，在农作物、蔬菜和果树各方面又创造了更多的优良品种，把某些植物种推到了更遥远的北方；在农业技术方面更有光辉的成就。在米丘林学说被广泛地应用以后，某些作物单位面积的产量已由多年来的低产达到或超过了世界上最高的水平。不仅如此，米丘林学说在改进畜牧事业及其他有关事业方面也都取得了良好的效果。所有这些，都为苏联高额而稳定的产量，提供了极其有力的保证。米丘林学说就这样按照辩证唯物主义，通过实践，确定理论；根据理论，创造方法；应用方法，改进实践；使实践、理论、方法三者能够密切地互相依赖，不断地互相推动，从而使米丘林学说的内容能够迅速地丰富和发展起来。最后，应该指出，米丘林学说全面地传到我国，成为我国农业科学上的主导力量，迄今不过数年的历史，但它在改造我国农业科学和生产实践的关系上面已产生了巨大的影响，它在使农业科学工作者提高我国农业生产上面已起了前所未有的作用。不可否认，米丘林学说已把我国农业科学推上了一个新的历史阶段。因此，我们认为，充满创造性的米丘林学说是发展我国社会主义农业最可靠最有效的科学武器，我们必须进一步地加强对它的学习和运用，以使米丘林学说深入地贯彻到农业生产中去，使我国的生物科学和农业科学能够适应于我国社会主义建设的需要。（附图片）
