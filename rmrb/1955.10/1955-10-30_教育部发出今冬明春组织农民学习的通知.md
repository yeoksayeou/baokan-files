The Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China issued a notice to local education administrative departments on October 24 regarding the organization of farmers to participate in learning from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956.

The notice stated that the current progress of literacy education for farmers is very slow, far behind the agricultural cooperativization movement. This is very detrimental to socialist construction. Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously develop literacy education to meet the needs of agricultural cooperativization.

The notice requires all localities to closely follow the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and regard literacy education as an integral part of agricultural cooperativization. Starting from the winter of 1955, extensively mobilize rural cadres, activists, cooperative members, mutual aid team members, and other qualified farmers to participate in cultural learning. The demand for organizing farmers to study culture this winter should greatly exceed the originally planned number for eliminating illiteracy. All localities should first re-formulate plans for organizing farmers to participate in literacy education from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1956 based on this spirit. At the same time, vigorously promote the establishment of schools by cooperatives and mutual aid teams to organize farmer learning. Learning organizations based on villages should absorb cooperative members and mutual aid team members as much as possible, and rely on the organizations of cooperatives and mutual aid teams to mobilize and inspect the learning of members and team members.

The notice pointed out that farmer literacy education must achieve "learning for practical use," meet the requirements of agricultural cooperativization, and meet the requirements of developing production. Therefore, literacy teaching should first teach farmers to learn the names of people, place names, cooperative names, tool names, farm work names, crop names, names of weights and measures, dates, numbers, and other characters and languages necessary for recording work points in their own villages and townships, and then learn further characters and languages. Literacy textbooks must also be compiled in this way. In terms of political education, the main content should be propaganda on agricultural cooperativization and the First Five-Year Plan. This must be closely integrated with the central work of the local rural areas.

The notice stated that in recent years, many junior and senior high school graduates have returned to the countryside to engage in production, and many farmers and intellectuals who have completed literacy education can be mobilized to work as literacy teachers. People in rural areas who are literate should be called upon to participate in the elimination of illiteracy and serve as literacy teachers.

The notice pointed out that to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy, it is necessary to regularize farmers' spare-time learning. In the past, very few people transferred to year-round people's schools after winter schools, so many people only studied sporadically, resulting in "attending winter school every year and learning from scratch every year." This shortcoming should be corrected in the future so that farmers can persist in learning throughout the year. In order to ensure that production and learning are not hindered, the learning time can be reduced and the teaching progress slowed down appropriately after spring plowing, and classes will only be suspended during the busy farming season. The main ways to solve the problem of learning time: First, the leadership of villages, cooperatives, and mutual aid teams should uniformly arrange the time for production, work (meetings), and learning. The various meetings of villages, cooperatives, and mutual aid teams should be scheduled, and unnecessary or mergeable meetings should be streamlined and merged, and unnecessary participants should not attend. Second, inspire and consolidate farmers' enthusiasm for learning, and encourage them to use all possible time to learn. Third, in terms of organization, various forms such as classes, groups, contracted teaching and learning, and self-study should be adopted according to the agricultural season and the specific circumstances of farmers (including cadres).

The notice finally required education administrative departments to strengthen their leadership over farmer literacy education. The education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities must formulate plans for developing literacy education according to the requirements of the agricultural cooperativization plan of their respective provinces and cities, and submit them to the Party committees and governments so that they can be included in the overall plan for rural work. Only in this way can literacy education progress with the progress of the agricultural cooperativization movement. After formulating the plan, education administrative departments at all levels should also frequently supervise and inspect it, promptly discover problems, summarize experiences, provide specific guidance to subordinates, and help solve problems.
Xinhua News Agency Correction: In the news release "Capital Holds Meeting to Commemorate the Centenary of the Birth of Michurin" (see page one of this newspaper on the 29th), in paragraph three, the phrase "academically, to doubt and allow the publication of different views," "doubt" should be "welcome."

    教育部发出今冬明春组织农民学习的通知
    中华人民共和国教育部十月二十四日向各地教育行政部门发出关于一九五五年冬到一九五六年春组织农民参加学习的通知。
    通知中说，当前农民识字教育进展很缓慢，远远落在农业合作化运动的后面。这对社会主义建设是很不利的。因此，必须大力开展识字教育，以适应农业合作化的需要。
    通知要求各地紧紧跟随着农业合作化运动的发展，把识字教育当成农业合作化的一个组成部分。从一九五五年冬季起，广泛动员乡村干部、积极分子、合作社社员、互助组组员以及其他有条件的农民参加文化学习。今冬组织农民学习文化，要求大大超过原订扫除文盲计划数字。各地首先应根据这一精神重新制定一九五五年冬到一九五六年春组织农民参加识字教育的计划。同时要大力提倡合作社和互助组办学，组织农民学习。以村为单位的学习组织，应尽量吸收合作社社员、互助组组员参加，并依靠合作社、互助组的组织，动员和检查社员、组员的学习。
    通知指出，农民识字教育，必须做到“学以致用”，符合农业合作化的要求，符合发展生产的要求。因此，识字教学应当首先教农民学习本村本乡的人名、地名、合作社名、工具名、农活名、庄稼名、度量衡名、年月日、数字及其他一些记工账所必需的文字和语言，然后再学进一步的文字和语言。识字课本也必须照这样编。政治教育方面，以宣传农业合作化和第一个五年计划为主要内容。这必须和当地农村的中心工作密切结合起来进行。
    通知中说，近年来已有很多初中、小学毕业生回到农村从事生产，还有不少已经受完识字教育的农民和一些知识分子，这些人都可以动员来作识字教师。应当号召农村识字的人都来参加扫除文盲运动，担任识字教师。
    通知指出，要完成扫除文盲任务，必须使农民的业余学习经常化。过去是冬学过后，转入常年民校学习的人很少，因而很多人就是一曝十寒，结果是“年年上冬学，年年从头学”。今后应当纠正这个缺点，使农民能够常年坚持学习。为了做到生产学习两不误，到春耕后可以酌量减少一些学习时间，放缓教学进度，只有在农忙季节才放假停课。解决学习时间问题的主要办法：一是由乡村、合作社、互助组的领导方面统一安排生产、工作（会议）和学习的时间。把农村、合作社、互助组的各种会议，排定日程，不必要的或可合并的会议精简合并，不必要参加的人不参加。二是启发和巩固农民的学习积极性，要他们利用可能利用的一切时间去学习。三是在组织上要根据农事季节和农民的（包括干部）具体情况，采用多种形式，如班级、小组、包教包学、自学等。
    通知最后要求教育行政部门要加强对农民识字教育的领导。各省市教育厅、局必须按照本省、市农业合作化规划的要求，拟订出发展识字教育的计划，提交党委和政府，以便他们把它列入农村工作全面规划之中。只有这样，才能使识字教育随着农业合作化运动的进展而进展。在拟订计划之后，各级教育行政部门，还要经常予以督促检查，及时发现问题，总结经验，予下面以具体指导，帮助解决问题。新华社更正二十九日新闻稿“首都举行米丘林诞生一百周年纪念会”稿（见二十九日本报一版）三段“在学术上要怀疑和允许发表不同见解”句中，“怀疑”应为“欢迎”。
