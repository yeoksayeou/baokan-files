Telegram of Respect to the State Council

Premier Zhou of the State Council:

The Second Session of the First People's Congress of Xinjiang Province has reviewed and summarized the work of the Provincial People's Government over the past six years. It unanimously believes that the work has been remarkable, and these achievements are mainly due to the leadership and special care of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang!

Now, the autonomous organs of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have been established, and the development of the political, economic, and cultural construction of all ethnic groups will enter a new stage. In the future, we will work even harder, under the leadership of the State Council, to build the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and to build our great socialist motherland! We send this telegram to express our respect.

The Entire Body of Representatives of the Second Session of the First People's Congress of Xinjiang Province
