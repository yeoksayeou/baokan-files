Xinhua News Agency, October 28th. The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a supplementary notice on October 28th regarding the convening of the Youth Afforestation Conference in the five provinces (autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan.

The notice stated: The Sanggan River, Hutuo River, and Zhang River basins within Shanxi Province have loose soil, few trees, and severe soil erosion, leading to frequent flooding in the lower reaches of these three rivers—the Yongding River, Ziya River, and Zhang River downstream within Hebei Province—causing significant harm to the Hebei Plain. In order to mobilize the vast youth of the Sanggan River, Hutuo River, and Zhang River basins to plant trees and conserve water and soil, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, it has been decided that thirty-five counties in this area of Shanxi Province will each send three to five people to participate in the Youth Afforestation Conference of the five provinces (autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Henan.

Thus, the total number of participants in the conference has increased to one thousand one hundred and fifty.

    团中央发出召开青年造林大会的补充通知
    新华社二十八日讯　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会二十八日发出关于召开陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古、河南五省（自治区）青年造林大会的补充通知。
    通知中说：山西省境内的桑乾河、滹沱河和漳河流域地区，土质松散，树木很少，水土流失严重，以致这三条河的下游，即河北省境内的永定河、子牙河和漳河下游经常泛滥成灾，对河北平原为害很大。为了动员桑乾河、滹沱河和漳河流域地区的广大青年植树造林保持水土，根据党中央同志的指示，特决定山西省这个地区的三十五个县各派三至五人参加陕西、甘肃、山西、内蒙古、河南五省（自治区）青年造林大会。
    这样，大会的总人数增加到一千一百五十人。
