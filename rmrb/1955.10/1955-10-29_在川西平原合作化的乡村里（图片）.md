    In the Cooperativized Villages of the Western Sichuan Plain
    The Western Sichuan Plain, which has reaped bumper harvests for six consecutive years after liberation, has established more than 5,000 agricultural production cooperatives, with over a thousand cooperativized villages and 101 basically cooperativized townships. These cooperativized villages are rapidly changing the face of the Western Sichuan Plain. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Zhongjing photographed:
    During the autumn plowing season, the tractors of the Pixian Agricultural Machinery Station came to the Xinsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huzhu Township for the first time to plow the fields. The township's amateur drama troupe performed "Picking Tea Leaves Lantern Dance" to welcome the arrival of the tractors.
    Chen Daoqing, a female member of the Xipu Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xipu Township, Pixian County, is driving mechanical farm implements for autumn plowing. She is one of the young farm implement operators and tractor drivers trained by the Pixian Agricultural Machinery Station last year.
    The Xinhua First Agricultural Production Cooperative of the cooperativized Gonghe Village in Pixian County has established a clinic and trained three health workers. This is health worker Hu Chunlan taking the temperature of a sick member.
    The Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative of the already cooperativized Shuanggui Village is actively carrying out basic construction after the autumn harvest. They plan to cut down field ridges and fill unnecessary irrigation ditches this year to expand the cultivated area by 35 mu. This is the members cutting field ridges and filling water ditches.
    This autumn plowing season, the more than 5,000 agricultural production cooperatives on the Western Sichuan Plain can basically use new-style farm implements for plowing. These are young members of the Second Branch of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the cooperativized Jiangjun Village of Pixian County learning to use a disc harrow.
    Zheng Rongguang, a poor peasant member of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shuanggui Village, Pixian County, is watching his wife sew new clothes for their children. Since joining the cooperative, Zheng Rongguang has always had more grain than his family of five can eat each year. This autumn, the whole family has had new clothes made.

    在川西平原合作化的乡村里
    解放后连获六年丰收的川西平原，已经建立了五千多个农业生产合作社，出现了上千个合作化村和一百零一个基本合作化乡。这些合作化了的乡村迅速地改变着川西平原的面貌。新华社记者　孙忠靖摄
    秋耕的时候，郫县农业机器站的拖拉机，第一次来到互助乡新生农业生产合作社代耕，乡的业余剧团为迎接拖拉机的到来演出“采茶灯”。
