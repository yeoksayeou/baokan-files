    Panchen Erdini's Congratulatory Telegram to Chairman Mao

    Respected Chairman Mao:
    On the occasion of the sixth anniversary of the founding of our great People's Republic of China, I, with immense joy, on behalf of the Tibetan monks and lay people, extend my heartfelt respect and congratulations to you—the creator of the happy life of our various ethnic groups.
    Under the wise leadership and kind care of the Chinese Communist Party and you, the lives of our Tibetan people have been greatly improved, and the construction of the Tibetan region is gradually beginning. Since the opening of the Kangding-Tibet and Qinghai-Tibet highways to Lhasa last year, we have received active assistance from the people of the interior in terms of manpower and material resources. Now, the Xigaze-Gyangze highway has been fully completed, and the Lhasa-Xigaze highway is about to be connected to the Xigaze-Gyangze highway. These have inspired our confidence in building the border region a hundredfold. Last year, the people affected by the disaster along the Nianchu River, under your parental care, not only safely survived the disaster period but also generally rebuilt their happy homes. This year, they have achieved a rare bumper harvest after more than ten years. This April, the Tibetan Engineering Survey Team came to Xigaze. They have completed the survey and design work for projects such as urban flood control and thermal power plants, providing favorable conditions for the construction work in the Xigaze area in the future. Under the brilliant light of your great national policy, the State Council passed the decision to establish the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region this March, which is a great joyous event that our Tibetan people have never experienced before. In the past six months, the Dalai Lama and I, as well as the officials and people of all strata under our jurisdiction, have been working hard to implement this decision. The preparatory office of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been established and is actively working for the early establishment of the Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee. Respected Chairman Mao, our Tibetan people have been united as never before, and no conspiracy to provoke discord can shake our will. We will always follow the Chinese Communist Party and march towards the road of happiness, and strive together with all fraternal ethnic groups to build our motherland into a great socialist country. I wish you—the great leader of our various ethnic groups—long life!
    Long live the great People's Republic of China!
    Panchen Erdini
                  September 30, 1955

    班禅额尔德尼向毛主席致敬电敬爱的毛主席：
    值此我们伟大的中华人民共和国诞生六周年的时候，我以万分高兴的心情谨代表西藏僧俗人民向您——我们各族人民幸福生活的缔造者致以衷心的敬意和祝贺。
    在中国共产党和您的英明领导及亲切关怀下，我们西藏人民的生活已得到很大的改善，西藏地区的建设也正在逐步开始，自从去年康藏、青藏两条公路通车拉萨以后，我们得到内地人民在人力物力等方面的积极帮助。现在日（喀则）江（孜）公路已经全线竣工，拉（萨）日（喀则）公路即将与日（喀则）江（孜）公路连接起来，这些更百倍地鼓舞了我们建设边疆的信心。去年年楚河沿岸受灾人民在您的父母般的关怀下，不仅安全地度过了灾期，并普遍重建起幸福家园，今年他们得到了十多年来罕见的丰收。今年四月西藏工程勘察队来到了日喀则，他们已完成了市区防洪、火力发电厂等项工程的勘测设计工作，为今后日喀则地区的建设工作提供了有利条件。在您的伟大的民族政策光辉照耀下，今年三月间国务院通过了成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的决定，这是我们西藏人民从没有过的大喜事。半年来，达赖喇嘛和我以及所属官员和各阶层人民都在为执行这一决定努力。西藏自治区筹备委员会筹备处已成立，正为自治区筹备委员会的早日成立积极工作。敬爱的毛主席，我们西藏人民已经团结的无比牢固，任何阴谋挑拨都动摇不了我们的意志，我们永远跟着中国共产党向幸福的大道迈进，和各兄弟民族一起把我们祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。祝您——我们各族人民的伟大领袖万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！班禅额尔德尼敬上
                  一九五五年九月三十日
                  藏历木羊年八月十四日
