Also present at the reception were: Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China Marshal Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Liu Shaoqi, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier of the State Council Marshal Chen Yi, Deputy Minister of National Defense General Tan Zheng, Naval General Xiao Jingguang, Senior General Li Da of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Senior General Su Yu, Senior General Li Kenong, Air Force General Liu Yalou, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of National Defense Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, and Deputy Military Attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Burma Lieutenant Colonel Xu Yimin.

Also present was the Ambassador of the Union of Burma to China, U Hla Maung.

During the reception, Lieutenant General Ne Win presented four silver bowls to Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai, respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Marshal Zhu De of the People's Republic of China held a banquet on the evening of the 5th to welcome all members of the Burmese Military Friendship Delegation and to bid farewell to Lieutenant General Ne Win, leader of the delegation and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Union of Burma, who will return home ahead of schedule.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended today's banquet.

U Hla Maung, Ambassador of the Union of Burma to China, Military Attaché Major Maung Maung, and military attachés, acting military attachés, and deputy military attachés from India, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Poland, Indonesia, and other countries also attended the banquet at invitation.

At the banquet, Marshal Zhu De and Lieutenant General Ne Win delivered speeches successively.

In his speech, Marshal Zhu De first welcomed the Burmese Military Friendship Delegation headed by Commander-in-Chief Ne Win to visit China. He said, I believe this visit is very meaningful for promoting Sino-Burmese friendship.

Marshal Zhu De said that the people of our two countries both love peace and need international peace, friendship, equality, and cooperation. The people need us to do this, and we should do it, and we should strive to defend peace. However, those who provoke war always try their best to create mutual suspicion and discord between countries that have already achieved independence and sovereignty in order to carry out their colonialist war policies. This policy is always doomed to failure. I firmly believe that the cause of defending peace and promoting friendship will surely be victorious.

Marshal Zhu De expressed his regret at Lieutenant General Ne Win's upcoming departure from Beijing to return to Rangoon. He said, Please convey the friendship and respect of our government, people, and army to the government, people, and army of the Union of Burma.

Marshal Zhu De welcomed other representatives of the delegation to continue to visit various places in our country. He said: You will see more of the determination of our people and army to build peace and defend peace, and you will see more of the friendly feelings of our people and army towards the people and army of the Union of Burma. I hope that the friendly relations between our two countries will be further developed.

Marshal Zhu De concluded by raising his glass and proposing a toast to the safe journey and health of Commander-in-Chief Ne Win and to the health of all the representatives!

In his speech, Lieutenant General Ne Win expressed that he was extremely pleased that the friendship between the Military Friendship Delegation and the Chinese People's Liberation Army could achieve success.

Lieutenant General Ne Win said that you have unreservedly allowed us to visit military schools, troops, military exercises, and related military buildings and factories, and have held symposiums for us, which proves how sincere and trusting the leaders of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are towards our Military Friendship Delegation. Therefore, we are very happy. I am infinitely grateful for the opportunity to learn and discuss.

Lieutenant General Ne Win said that before I came to China, I had doubts about the security of Burma, but after I arrived in China and saw the actual situation in China with my own eyes, my doubts were completely dispelled. After I return to my country, I am willing to work to enhance Burmese-Chinese friendship.

Lieutenant General Ne Win, on behalf of all the members of the delegation, thanked Marshal Zhu De for the banquet. He said that before I return to my country, I would like to take this last banquet as an opportunity to once again express my gratitude to all the friends who have treated us with meticulous care and enthusiasm from the day our Military Friendship Delegation arrived in the People's Republic of China.

Lieutenant General Ne Win concluded by raising his glass and saying, Cheers to the friendship between Burma and China, to the health and longevity of the leaders of the Chinese people, to the prosperity of the People's Republic of China, and to world peace!

Among those present at the banquet were Vice Premier of the State Council Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Commission Marshal He Long, Marshal Nie Rongzhen, Cheng Qian, Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, Long Yun, Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai, Deputy Ministers General Tan Zheng, Naval General Xiao Jingguang, Senior General Wang Shusheng, Senior General Li Da, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen, and Deputy Military Attaché of the Chinese Embassy in Burma Lieutenant Colonel Xu Yimin.

    奈温中将说，在我没有来中国以前，我曾对缅甸的安全发生疑虑，但当我到达中国后，亲眼看到中国的实际情况，我的疑虑完全打消了。我回国后，愿为增进缅中友好而努力。
    奈温中将代表全体团员感谢朱德元帅的宴请。他说，当我还没有回国以前，我要趁此最后的一次宴会，再一次地向为我们军事友好代表团到达中华人民共和国的那一天起就无微不至热忱地招待我们的各位朋友表示感谢。
