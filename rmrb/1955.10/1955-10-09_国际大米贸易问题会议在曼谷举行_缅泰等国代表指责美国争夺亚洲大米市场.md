Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 8th: A conference on international rice trade issues, organized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, was held in Bangkok from September 30th to October 8th.

At a meeting held on October 3rd, representatives from Myanmar and Thailand spoke out against the United States' policy of competing for the Asian rice market. The representative from Myanmar pointed out that the United States' dumping of large quantities of rice into Japan and the Asian market has caused enormous blows and threats to rice-producing countries that rely on selling rice to sustain their national economies and people's livelihoods. Facts have proven that the rice sales of these rice-producing countries are currently in a difficult situation.

Both the Myanmar and Thai representatives pointed out that Asian underdeveloped countries that accept "U.S. Aid" have gained nothing good except for becoming debtors to the United States. They said that if the United States sincerely wants to assist Asian underdeveloped countries, it should not compete for their markets, but should allow these countries to freely sell their rice to achieve economic self-reliance.

Representatives from many countries expressed support for the Myanmar representative's statement.

    国际大米贸易问题会议在曼谷举行
    缅泰等国代表指责美国争夺亚洲大米市场
    新华社八日讯　曼谷消息：联合国粮食和农业组织从九月三十日到十月八日，在曼谷召开了一个讨论国际大米贸易问题的会议。
    在十月三日举行的一次会议上，缅甸和泰国的代表发言指责美国争夺亚洲大米市场的政策。缅甸代表指出，美国以大量米粮向日本和亚洲市场倾销，已经使得依靠出售大米维持国计民生的产米国家受到了莫大的打击和威胁。事实证明，这些产米国家的大米销售目前处在困难的境地。
    缅甸代表和泰国代表都指出，接受“美援”的亚洲落后国家，除了成为美国的债务国以外，没有得到什么良好的结果。他们说，美国如果真诚地要援助亚洲落后国家，就不应该争夺它们的市场，而应该让这些国家能够自由销售它们出产的米粮以求得经济上的自力更生。
    有许多国家的代表表示支持缅甸代表的发言。
