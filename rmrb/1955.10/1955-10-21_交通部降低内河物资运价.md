    The Ministry of Communications, in order to reduce commodity circulation costs, has adjusted the freight rates for twenty-four types of goods with relatively high grades transported upstream from Shanghai, effective from October, with an average freight rate reduction of 41%. For example, the original freight rate for a double-铧 plow transported from Shanghai to Chongqing was 470 yuan per ton, but the adjusted freight rate is only 235 yuan, a reduction of 50%. The original freight rate for a lathe was 109 yuan per ton, and the adjusted freight rate is 76 yuan, a reduction of 30%. (Li Zhenhua)

    交通部降低内河物资运价
    交通部为减低商品流转费用，从十月份起调整了上海上水等级较高的二十四种物资运价，平均降低运价百分之四十一。例如双铧犁，原来由上海运至重庆的运价是每吨四百七十元，调整后的运价仅二百三十五元，降低百分之五十。车床的原运价每吨是一百零九元，调整后的运价是七十六元，降低了百分之三十。　（李震华）
