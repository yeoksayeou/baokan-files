Endless "Unease"

　　Today, the U.S. government feels “more uneasy” about the trend of world affairs than at any time since this spring. This was revealed on October 10th by Reston, a reporter for the American "New York Times".

　　According to Reston, what makes the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense uneasy is the "Bandung Spirit" and the "Geneva Spirit" recently manifested in the United Nations General Assembly and in many parts of the world.

　　At first glance, this seems very strange. People still remember that at the end of the Bandung Asian-African Conference, Dulles thought the results of the Asian-African Conference were "very good" and was "very encouraged" by the hope and confidence expressed in the final communiqué of the conference for the United Nations. In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly on September 22, Dulles also spoke of making the "Geneva Spirit permanent." After praising the "Bandung Spirit" and the "Geneva Spirit" in this way, it seems absurd that the United States is uneasy about the manifestation of these spirits. But Reston's report leaves no doubt about the U.S. government's bleak mood.

　　Reston said that Western countries have only recently discovered "what the 'Bandung Spirit' is all about," "because the countries participating in the Bandung Conference vividly demonstrated their anti-colonial policies at the current United Nations General Assembly meeting, and created sharp dilemmas there not only for Britain, France, and the Netherlands, but also for the United States."

　　As for the manifestation of the "Geneva Spirit," according to Reston, it is even worse. Reston pointed out that although the United States has tried its best to convince people after the Geneva Four-Power Conference that "nothing has happened that would justify Western countries reducing their armed forces," "however, Britain has begun to reduce its standing army, and at the same time, there is widespread speculation that other Western European countries will do the same." On the German issue, "The Federal Republic of Germany has agreed to establish diplomatic relations with Moscow—a decision that makes the Soviet Union the only major power that has direct relations with both East and West Germany." In short, Washington now sees that the socialist camp's efforts to ease the international situation are making the idea of ​​"coexistence" "spread and win support for proposals to resolve world problems according to the status quo."

　　Obviously, anyone who hopes to see the colonial countries of Asia and Africa gain independence, and anyone who hopes to see the international situation further eased, cannot but welcome the manifestation of the "Bandung Spirit" and the "Geneva Spirit," but the United States does not feel the same way about this. According to Reston, this performance has caused the United States to "encounter difficulties in many parts of the world," so Washington has recently been "devaluing" the "Bandung Spirit" and the "Geneva Spirit."

　　However, it is impossible to "devalue" the "Bandung Spirit" and the "Geneva Spirit" that embody the common aspirations of the people of all countries. What should be "devalued" is precisely the U.S. policy of strength and colonialism. As long as the United States does not recognize this, it will have endless "unease."

### 无休止的“不安”

    无休止的“不安”
    今天美国政府对于世界事务的趋向比今年春天以来的任何时候都“更加感到不安”。这是美国“纽约时报”记者赖斯顿十月十日透露的情况。
    据赖斯顿说，使得美国国务院和国防部感到不安的是最近在联合国大会上和世界许多地区所表现出来的“万隆精神”和“日内瓦精神”。
    乍一听来，这似乎是很奇怪的。人们还记得，在万隆亚非会议结束的时候，杜勒斯曾经认为亚非会议的结果“非常好”，并且对于会议的最后公报中对联合国所表示的希望和信心感到“很受鼓舞”。杜勒斯在九月二十二日联合国大会上的演说中也曾经谈到要使“日内瓦精神成为永久的”。在对“万隆精神”和“日内瓦精神”作了这样的歌颂之后，美国对这些精神的表现却又感到不安，这似乎是荒唐的。但是赖斯顿的报道却使得人们对于美国政府的这种黯淡心情不能有任何怀疑。
    赖斯顿说，西方国家直到最近才发现“万隆精神”“到底是怎么一回事”，“因为参加万隆会议的国家在目前联合国大会会议中生动地表演了它们的反殖民主义政策，并且在那里不仅为英国、法国和荷兰，而且也为美国制造了尖锐的窘境”。
    至于“日内瓦精神”的表现，照赖斯顿的看法，那就更糟了。赖斯顿指出，尽管美国在日内瓦四大国会议以后竭力企图使人们相信“并没有发生任何事情可以证明西方国家应当裁减武装力量”，“然而，英国已着手裁减它的常备军，同时这里普遍猜测其他西欧国家也将这样做”。在德国问题上，“西德联邦共和国已同意同莫斯科建立外交关系——这个决定使苏联成了大国中唯一同东西德都发生直接关系的国家”。总而言之，华盛顿现在看出，社会主义阵营和缓国际局势的努力正在使“共处”思想“推广开来并且赢得人们支持按照现状解决世界问题的建议”。
    很明显，凡是希望看到亚洲和非洲的殖民地国家获得独立的人，凡是希望看到国际局势进一步和缓的人，对于“万隆精神”和“日内瓦精神”得到的表现，都不能不表示欢迎，而美国却对此毫无同感。照赖斯顿的话，这种表现使得美国“在世界上许多地方都碰到了困难”，因此华盛顿最近在把“万隆精神”和“日内瓦精神”“予以贬价”。
    但是，要把体现着各国人民的共同愿望的“万隆精神”和“日内瓦精神”“贬价”是办不到的。应该“贬价”的恰恰倒是美国的实力政策和殖民主义。只要美国一天不认识到这一点，它就有无休止的“不安”。
