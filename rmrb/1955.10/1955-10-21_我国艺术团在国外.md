Chinese Art Troupe Visits and Performs in Nghệ An Province

The Chinese Art Troupe, which is currently visiting Vietnam, arrived in Vinh City, the capital of Nghệ An Province, on the afternoon of the 17th for a visit and performance. Ninety percent of the city's residents came out of their homes to welcome the Chinese Art Troupe. The welcoming crowd stretched for two kilometers from the outskirts of the city to the city center. People stood on the muddy roadside after the rain, enthusiastically throwing bouquets of flowers into the hands of the Chinese performers. When the Chinese Art Troupe's motorcade entered the ancient city square of Vinh City, the cheers of tens of thousands of people resounded like thunder.

On the evening of the 18th, the Chinese Art Troupe held its first performance at the Vinh City Grand Theater, with an audience of 23,000. Among them was a local resident named Deng Fang, who was blind in both eyes but still insisted on attending. After the performance, he said to the Chinese actors: "You sang the song praising the victory of Dien Bien Phu so well, because you understand Vietnam and the significance of the victory of Dien Bien Phu."

Chinese Classical Song and Dance Troupe Concludes Visit to Sweden

After two performances at the Gothenburg Grand Theatre in Sweden on the 17th and 18th, the Chinese Classical Song and Dance Troupe has concluded its visit to Sweden.

The Chinese Classical Song and Dance Troupe's performances in Gothenburg were a great success. Gothenburg occupies a particularly important position in Sweden's theatrical life, and many of Sweden's best song and dance drama programs are often performed in Gothenburg first. As can be seen from local newspaper reports, the artistic circles and the public in Gothenburg had long been waiting for the performance of the Chinese Classical Song and Dance Troupe with great interest.

When the Chinese Classical Song and Dance Troupe performed in Gothenburg for the first time on the 17th, the theater's orchestra pit and the entrance were crowded with people who had not bought tickets. As soon as the performance ended, many local theater figures rushed backstage to warmly congratulate the actors. A well-known local actress, Märta Ternstedt, hugged and kissed the Chinese actors tightly. She said that she was completely amazed by the perfection of Chinese classical art. Jörgen, the Speaker of the Gothenburg City Council and Mayor, and Lewitz, the Deputy Chairman of the Gothenburg Grand Theatre Council, presented flowers and gifts to the leaders and actors of the troupe at the end of the performance.

Before leaving Stockholm, the Chinese Classical Song and Dance Troupe, at the invitation of Erikson, the Minister of Social Affairs of Sweden, held a charity performance on the evening of October 15 for the national Swedish blind welfare organization "Association for the Blind." More than 1,800 people watched the performance. City Councilor Mähl of Stockholm gave a speech after the performance, thanking the Chinese Classical Song and Dance Troupe for the charity performance, and believed that the performance was "a valuable contribution to the important social cause represented by the blind organization."

    中国古典歌舞剧团十七日和十八日在瑞典哥德堡大剧院两次演出后，已经结束了它在瑞典的访问。
    中国古典歌舞剧团在哥德堡的演出获得了很大的成功。哥德堡在瑞典的戏剧生活中占有特别重要的地位，许多瑞典最好的歌舞戏剧节目常常首先在哥德堡演出。从当地报纸的报道中可以看出，哥德堡的艺术界和公众早就怀着极大的兴趣在等待着中国古典歌舞剧团的演出。
    中国古典歌舞剧团十七日第一次在哥德堡演出时，剧院的乐队池和门口都挤满了没有买到票的人们。演出刚一结束，就有不少当地戏剧界人士拥到后台向演员们热烈祝贺。当地著名的女演员玛尔达·特恩斯台特使劲抱着中国演员们接吻。她说，她完全被中国古典艺术的完美所惊倒了。哥德堡市议会议长兼市长容根和哥德堡大剧院理事会副主席列维茨在演出结束时向剧团领导人和演员献花和赠礼。
    中国古典歌舞剧团在离开斯德哥尔摩前，应瑞典社会事务部大臣伊里克逊的邀请，在十月十五日晚为瑞典全国性的盲人福利团体“盲人协会”举行了一场义务演出。观看演出的有一千八百多人。斯德哥尔摩市议会议员麦尔在演出结束后讲话，感谢中国古典歌舞剧团的义务演出，并且认为那次演出是“对于盲人组织所代表的重要社会事业的有价值的贡献”。　（据新华社讯）
