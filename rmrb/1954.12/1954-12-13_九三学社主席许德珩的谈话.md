Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" has once again solemnly demonstrated to the world the unshakable will of China's 600 million people to liberate Taiwan, oppose aggression, and safeguard peace. I, on behalf of all members of the Jiusan Society, express our firm support.

The people of the world can see very clearly that the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is a "treaty" that thoroughly prepares for a war of aggression. All ten articles of the "treaty" demonstrate the attempt of the U.S. aggressors to use this "treaty," which it created single-handedly, to "legitimize" its illegal occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, so as to further use Taiwan as a military base to launch a new world war. Although U.S. Secretary of State Dulles shamelessly said that this "treaty" is "defensive in nature," and even used such nonsense as the contracting parties reaffirming their "faith in the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and governments" in the preamble of the "treaty" to conceal its plot to launch a war of aggression, the ironclad facts have already given the U.S. aggressors a resounding slap in the face. In fact, as soon as the U.S.-Chiang treaty was signed, Dulles openly stated that "this treaty will become another link in the collective security system (should be read as collective aggression war system) established by the various collective defense treaties that the United States has concluded with other countries in the Pacific region." That is to say, the U.S. aggressors want to link the U.S.-Chiang treaty with the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" that it pieced together some time ago and the "Northeast Asia Defense League" that it is planning to piece together, in order to form an eastern aggression system, and link this aggression system with the already established European aggression system through a Middle East aggression system, creating a war encirclement around the world. The facts even more specifically illustrate that as soon as the U.S.-Chiang treaty was signed, the U.S. aggressors more wantonly strengthened their war activities around the Taiwan Strait, planned to establish the so-called "Sino-American Military Planning Committee," sent more U.S. armed forces, and used a large number of military materials, including jet fighters and escort destroyers, to "increase the mobility and attack power of Chiang Kai-shek's troops." All this irrefutably proves that the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is by no means "defensive in nature," but a serious war provocation against the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, the greatest mockery and insult to the United Nations Charter, and a direct threat to the peace and security of Asia and the world.

Anyone with a clear mind can see that no country wants to invade the United States and infringe upon the security of the United States; it is the United States that is establishing military bases on Chinese territory Taiwan and Penghu, five thousand miles away from its mainland, sheltering the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who has long been spurned by the Chinese people, and preventing the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan. Everyone knows that occupying the territory of other countries, infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries, and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries is aggression. The U.S. aggressors are so brazen as to call this naked act of aggression "defense," which is truly ignorant of shame!

In his statement, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai solemnly pointed out that historical mistakes must not be repeated. Only by resisting aggression can we safeguard peace. This is the firm position of all peace-loving people in China and the world. People who have suffered the disasters of war due to historical mistakes can never forget the bloody lessons of the past. People should still clearly remember how the Japanese militarists and the fascist bandits such as Hitler and Mussolini launched a worldwide war of aggression with the acquiescence, connivance, and encouragement of some countries. They forcibly occupied the territory of other countries, trampled on the sovereignty of other countries, and interfered in the internal affairs of other countries, supposedly for "self-defense" and "living space." Now, the U.S. aggressors are following the old path of Japanese, German, and Italian fascists, using the same excuses and means to create a new world war. Under this serious situation, instead of learning from the past, the United Kingdom is repeating Chamberlain's policy of appeasement and adopting a policy of acquiescence, connivance, and encouragement towards the U.S.'s unbridled acts of aggression, which not only violates the interests of the people of the world but also violates the interests of the British people. British officials echoed the U.S. aggressors by saying that the U.S.-Chiang treaty is "purely defensive in nature" and that this "treaty" has a "restraining influence" on the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, and intentionally put aside the American robbers who are creating a war of aggression and disrupting world peace, while hypocritically hoping that China will not take so-called "rash actions." This kind of practice of putting the cart before the horse and helping the evildoer cannot but arouse the indignation of the Chinese people. This fact naturally reminds us of the shameful speech made by British Prime Minister Churchill to the voters in his constituency (Woodford) on November 23rd of this year. He admitted without being forced to do so: "Even before the end of the war, when hundreds of thousands of Germans surrendered to us and our streets were filled with joyful crowds, I had already telegraphed Montgomery, instructing him to carefully collect the weapons of the Germans and store them away, so that if the Soviet Union continued to advance, it would be very convenient to reissue this batch of weapons to the German soldiers with whom we must cooperate." This passage has exposed to the people of the world all the secrets of the British ruling group's harmful activities to world peace, such as arming West Germany, arming Japan, and the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," following the U.S. aggressors step by step. For a long time, the British ruling group and some reactionary public opinions have disregarded the solemn international obligations that the United Kingdom once participated in signing the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," spreading extremely absurd arguments such as "Taiwan's neutralization" and "Taiwan's trusteeship by the United Nations." After the U.S.-Chiang treaty was announced, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office openly said: "The future status of Taiwan must be accepted by all parties directly concerned and must be consulted with them." Such remarks that sacrifice China's territory and sovereignty and encourage U.S. aggression are resolutely opposed by the Chinese people.

In their long and victorious struggle against imperialist aggression, the Chinese people have proven with brilliant facts that no war threat can intimidate the Chinese people. We oppose war and advocate peace, but we can never beg for peace at the cost of our territory and sovereignty. In order to safeguard peace, we must resist aggression. The U.S. aggressors are the mortal enemies of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world, and Chiang Kai-shek is a criminal who sells out Taiwan, threatens the security of the motherland, and threatens the peace of Asia and the world. In order to ensure national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in order to strive for genuine and lasting world peace, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. The traitor Chiang Kai-shek is ten thousand times more sinful than the traitor Wang Jingwei. The Chinese people must bring him to justice. Any treaty signed by the U.S. aggressive group and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, including this U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," is fundamentally illegal and therefore invalid.

Liberating Taiwan is the glorious historical task of the Chinese people. Facing this great task, the people of the whole country must unite more closely, strengthen their work in all aspects, and contribute all their strength to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan. All members of the Jiusan Society and the national cultural, educational, and scientific workers must, together with the people of the whole country, be prepared to respond to the call of the government at any time and actively participate in all work to liberate Taiwan. All patriotic cultural, educational, and scientific figures in Taiwan must take active actions to cooperate with the struggle to liberate Taiwan and disintegrate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous regime. We believe that the powerful Chinese people, who have defeated Japanese imperialism and overthrown the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, who was armed to the teeth by the U.S. aggressors, will surely victoriously liberate Taiwan, recover all the territory occupied by the United States, and bury the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" together!

### 九三学社主席许德珩的谈话

    九三学社主席许德珩的谈话
    周恩来外交部长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，再一次向全世界严正地表明了中国六万万人民解放台湾、反对侵略、保卫和平的不可动摇的意志，我代表九三学社全体社员表示坚决拥护。
    全世界人民都看得很清楚：美蒋“共同防御条约”是一个彻头彻尾准备侵略战争的“条约”。“条约”全文十条，没有一条不是表明美国侵略者企图利用这个它一手制造出来的“条约”，使它非法侵占我国领土台湾的行为“合法化”，以便进一步利用台湾作为军事基地来发动新的世界战争。美国国务卿杜勒斯虽然恬不知耻地说这个“条约”是
  “防御性质的”，甚至在“条约”的序言中还以缔约国重申它们“对联合国宪章之宗旨与原则之信心及其与所有人民及政府和平相处之愿望”这类鬼话来掩饰它发动侵略战争的阴谋。但铁一般的事实已经给美国侵略者打了一记响亮的耳光。事实上，美蒋条约一经签订，杜勒斯就公开地表示“这个条约将成为美国同太平洋地区的其他国家已经缔结的各种集体防御条约所建立的集体安全体系（应读为集体侵略战争体系）中的另一环节”。这就是说，美国侵略者要把美蒋条约和它前些时拼凑的“东南亚集体防务条约”以及正在策划拼凑的“东北亚防御联盟”联结起来，以形成东方侵略体系，并使这个侵略体系和已经建立的欧洲侵略体系经过一个中东侵略体系联结起来，造成一道环绕世界的战争包围圈。事实更具体地说明：美蒋条约一经签订，美国侵略者就更加放肆地在台湾海峡周围加强战争活动，筹设所谓“中美军事计划委员会”，增派美国武装部队，并以大批军事物资包括喷气式战斗机和护航驱逐舰，去“增加蒋介石部队的机动性和攻击力量”。这一切都无可辩驳地证明了：美蒋“共同防御条约”绝不是什么“防御性质的”，而是对中华人民共和国和中国人民的严重的战争挑衅，是对联合国宪章的最大的嘲弄和污辱，是对亚洲及世界各国的和平安全的直接威胁。
    任何头脑清醒的人都可以看出：并没有什么国家要侵略美国，侵害美国的安全；倒是美国在远离它本土五千英里以外的中国领土台湾和澎湖建立军事基地，庇护早已为中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石卖国贼，阻挠中国人民去解放自己的领土台湾。大家知道，侵占别国的领土，侵犯别国的主权，干涉别国的内政，就是侵略。美国侵略者竟强词夺理地把这种赤裸裸的侵略行为说成是“防御”，这真是不知人间有羞耻事！
    周恩来外长在他的声明中郑重指出：历史的错误不许重演。只有反抗侵略，才能保卫和平。这是全中国和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的坚决主张。曾经由于历史的错误而受尽战争灾难的人们永远不能忘记过去的血的教训。人们应该还清楚地记得，当年日本军国主义者和希特勒、墨索里尼等法西斯匪首怎样在有些国家的默认、纵容和鼓励之下发动了全世界规模的侵略战争，他们强占别国的领土，蹂躏别国的主权，干涉别国的内政，据说也是为了
  “自卫”，为了“生存空间”。现在，美国侵略者又在走日、德、意法西斯主义者的老路，以同样的借口和手段来制造新的世界战争。在这个严重的局势之下，英国不从过去的历史中吸取教训，反而重蹈张伯伦的绥靖主义的覆辙，对于美国这种肆无忌惮的侵略行为，采取了默认、纵容和鼓励的政策，这不仅违背全世界人民而且也违背英国人民的利益。英国官方附和着美国侵略者说美蒋条约是“纯防御性质的”，说这个“条约”对于蒋介石卖国集团有“抑制影响”，并且有意把制造侵略战争、扰乱世界和平的美国强盗放在一边，而假惺惺地希望中国不要采取所谓“轻率的行动”。这种倒果为因、为虎作伥的作法，不能不引起中国人民的愤慨。这个事实，很自然地使我们联想到英国邱吉尔首相本年十一月二十三日向他的选区（伍德佛）的选民们发表的可耻的演说，他不打自招地供认：“甚至在战争结束以前，在数以十万计的德国人向我们投降、我们的街道上挤满了欢乐的人群的时候，我就已经打电报给蒙哥马利，指示他仔细收集德国人的武器，把它们收藏起来，这样，如果苏联继续前进的话，就可以很方便地把这批武器重新发给我们必须与之合作的德国士兵。”这段话已经向全世界人民暴露了英国统治集团在武装西德、武装日本以及美蒋“共同防御条约”这一系列的危害世界和平的罪恶活动上和美国侵略者亦步亦趋的全部秘密。许久以来，英国统治集团和某些反动舆论就不顾英国曾经参与“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”的签订这一庄严的国际义务，散布“台湾中立化”、“台湾由联合国托管”等等极为荒谬的论调。美蒋条约公布之后，英国外交部发言人又公然说：“台湾未来的地位，必须为直接有关各方所接受，并且必须和他们磋商。”这种牺牲中国领土、主权、鼓励美国侵略活动的言论，是中国人民坚决反对的。
    中国人民在自己长期反抗帝国主义侵略的胜利斗争中，已用光辉的事实证明，任何战争威胁决不能把中国人民吓倒，我们反对战争，主张和平，但决不能拿自己的领土和主权作代价乞求和平。为了保卫和平，必须反抗侵略。美国侵略者是中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的死敌，蒋介石是出卖台湾、威胁祖国安全及亚洲和世界和平的罪犯。为了保障国家主权和领土完整，为了争取真正的持久的世界和平，中国人民一定要解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团。蒋贼介石这个卖国罪犯比汉奸汪精卫还要罪恶深重一万倍，中国人民一定要把他缉拿归案。美国侵略集团和蒋介石卖国贼所签订的任何条约，包括这次美蒋“共同防御条约”，根本是非法的，因而是无效的。
    解放台湾是中国人民光荣的历史任务。全国人民面临着这个伟大的任务，必须更加紧密地团结一致，从各方面加强自己的工作，贡献出一切力量来支援解放台湾的斗争。九三学社全体社员和全国文教科学工作者，必须和全国人民一道，准备随时响应政府的号召，积极参加解放台湾的一切工作。在台湾的一切爱国的文教科学界人士，要以积极的行动来配合解放台湾的斗争，瓦解蒋介石卖国政权。我们相信，曾经打败了日本帝国主义、推翻了被美国侵略者武装到牙齿的蒋介石反动统治的强大的中国人民，一定可以胜利地解放台湾，收复被美国侵占的一切领土，把蒋介石卖国贼和美蒋“共同防御条约”一齐埋葬！　（新华社）
