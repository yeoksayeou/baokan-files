Comrades and friends!

First, please allow me to extend my heartfelt brotherly greetings to you—the participants of the Second National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association—and wish you success in your work.

At the same time, please allow me, through you—the participants of the congress—to extend warm congratulations to all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and wish them even more outstanding achievements in strengthening the brotherly cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and China.

The unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is developing and consolidating year by year. The great vitality of Soviet-Chinese friendship lies in the fact that it is in line with the fundamental interests of the people of the Soviet Union and China, who are united in the common goal of building socialism and communism; moreover, this friendship is a powerful factor in defending peace and ensuring the security of all nations.

The close cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and China is developing smoothly and fruitfully, enriching the cultures of our two peoples.

The cultural cooperation between our two peoples is very multifaceted. The exchange of information between scientific and cultural institutions in the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is being carried out on an increasingly broad scale; the Soviet Union has published four volumes of Comrade Mao Zedong's Selected Works; many works by Chinese scholars have been translated into Russian and published, and a large number of books and pamphlets by Soviet authors have been published to introduce the achievements of the Chinese people in various aspects of political, economic, and cultural life to the Soviet people.

Not long ago, the editorial board of the Soviet Encyclopedia published a special book introducing the situation in China, which was highly praised by all sectors of Soviet society. The editing and publication of this book is the result of the joint creative labor of scholars from the Soviet Union and China, and is also an example of the fruitful scientific cooperation between the two countries, which is developing and consolidating for the benefit of our two peoples.

In the magnificent new buildings of the National Moscow University and in the lecture halls, research rooms, and laboratories of many other Soviet institutions of higher learning, outstanding children of our brotherly Chinese people are studying alongside Soviet students. The young Chinese men and women studying in Soviet universities are all resolute, hardworking, and love their great motherland. They are successfully mastering the high achievements of science and will undoubtedly become outstanding experts in various economic and cultural fields and return to their free and happy motherland.

In People's China, everyone is widely studying and mastering the achievements of Soviet industrial and agricultural innovators. We, the Soviet people, are sincerely pleased that our Chinese brothers are applying the experience and achievements of our advanced industrial and agricultural workers, as well as the experience and achievements of Soviet scholars, cultural, and artistic workers, in the struggle for the economic and cultural prosperity of New China.

The measures of exchanging cultural delegations which are being widely implemented play an important role in strengthening our two countries' cultural ties. We can point out with gratitude that the members of the delegation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, who recently visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, not only learned about the life of the Soviet people, but also actively gave lectures and reports to various sectors of Soviet society, introducing the achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party to the Soviet people.

The members of the delegation of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association who visited the Soviet Union in May and June of 1954 alone, gave more than forty lectures and reports in Moscow, Leningrad, Baku, and Novosibirsk, which were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in the Soviet Union.

Soviet art troupes and individual performers are performing in China more and more frequently, and actors from the People's Republic of China are performing in the Soviet Union. The Song and Dance Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army performed in many cities in the Soviet Union. The high performing skills of all the talented performers of the troupe were warmly welcomed by the Soviet audience. Through the Song and Dance Troupe, the Soviet people expressed warm congratulations to the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army and the brotherly Chinese people.

On December 20, the opening ceremony of the Second Film Exhibition of the People's Republic of China was solemnly held at the "House of Film Workers" in Moscow. Soviet audiences watched new Chinese films such as "Chop off the Devil's Claws," "Chicken Feather Letter," and "Dragon Beard Ditch" with great interest in major cinemas in Moscow. During the Second Chinese Film Exhibition held in Moscow, the capitals of various union republics, and other cities in the Soviet Union, a total of eighteen Chinese feature films and documentaries were screened. Millions of Soviet people who watched these films gained a deeper understanding of the lives of the brotherly Chinese people.

The works of Chinese writers have been translated into Russian and the languages of various Soviet nationalities, and the number of copies issued is increasing day by day. Soviet readers are familiar with, love, and cherish the works of outstanding Chinese writers and poets such as Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Ding Ling, and Zhao Shuli.

In 1954, the immortal work of the great Chinese people's artistic genius—Luo Guanzhong's full-length novel "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"—was published in Moscow. This novel was translated into Russian and published for the first time.

These and many other forms of friendly cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and China are further developing and consolidating the sincere feelings of friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association plays a significant role in strengthening the friendship and cultural cooperation between our two peoples. In the five years since its establishment, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has carried out tremendous and fruitful work in strengthening the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

Here, I would like to especially point out the tremendous work done by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in introducing the peaceful labor, life, and cultural achievements of the Chinese people to all sectors of Soviet society. The Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and other Soviet agencies and organizations regularly receive new literary and artistic works, the most popular Chinese music scores, photographs, exhibition pictures, and other materials introducing the lives of the Chinese people from the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

Currently, the Pushkin Museum in Moscow is holding an exhibition of outstanding Chinese arts and crafts, which was jointly prepared by the headquarters of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China. Muscovites visit this exhibition with enthusiasm and have a great interest in it.

Not long ago, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association presented the Soviet Union with a set of exhibition photos entitled "New China Marching Towards Socialism." The Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries reproduced this set of pictures and exhibited them simultaneously in four cities: Moscow, Leningrad, Minsk, and Baku.

The Soviet people are deeply concerned about all aspects of life in the People's Republic of China. They are sincerely happy whenever they hear new news of the achievements of the great Chinese people in their heroic struggle for their bright and happy future, and they warmly hope that their Chinese brothers will achieve new and great achievements on the road to building socialism.

The Soviet working people are convinced that the Chinese people, under the leadership of their long-tested and battle-hardened Communist Party, will surely successfully complete the task of carrying out socialist transformation in their beautiful motherland, and will raise the material and cultural welfare of the working people in urban and rural areas to an unprecedented height.

Dear Comrades!

Please allow me to read out the congratulatory message entrusted to us by the Council of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to the Second National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association: To the participants of the Second National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Dear friends and comrades!

The Council of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries extends its heartfelt brotherly greetings to the participants of the congress and, through you, to all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association!

An unbreakable brotherly friendship unites the great Soviet people and the great people of the People's Republic of China. This friendship is the source of prosperity for our two peoples and a powerful force guaranteeing world peace.

The tremendous and fruitful work carried out by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in expanding and deepening the brotherly cooperation between our two countries is making a valuable contribution to the cause of further consolidating the unbreakable Soviet-Chinese friendship.

We warmly and sincerely hope that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association will achieve greater success in the noble work it is doing for the happiness of our two peoples.

Long live the increasing prosperity of the great Chinese people!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable brotherly friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China—a powerful factor for world peace—which is developing day by day!

The Council of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries

    苏联对外文化协会理事会副主席
    维兹日林的讲话亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    首先请允许我向你们——中苏友好协会第二次全国代表会的参加者，致衷心的兄弟的敬礼并祝你们的工作获得成功。
    同时，请允许我通过你们——代表会的参加者，向中苏友好协会全体会员致热烈的祝贺，并祝他们在加强苏中两国人民兄弟般的合作事业中获得更卓越的成就。
    苏联和中华人民共和国两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊，在一年一年地发展和巩固。苏中友谊的伟大生命力量，就在于这种友谊是符合于团结在建设社会主义和共产主义的共同奋斗目标之下的苏中两国人民的根本利益的；而且，这个友谊是保卫和平和保证各国人民安全的强有力的因素。
    苏中两国的亲密的文化合作正在顺利地和富有成效地在发展着，这种文化合作使我们两国人民的文化彼此得到了充实和丰富。
    我们两国人民之间的文化合作，是非常多方面的。苏联和中华人民共和国的科学与文化机关之间的资料交换工作，在日益广泛地实行着；苏联已经出版了四卷毛泽东同志的选集；许多中国学者的著作被译为俄文出版，并且还大量地出版了苏联作者所写的向苏联人民介绍中国人民在政治、经济和文化生活各方面成就的书籍和小册子。
    不久以前，苏联大百科全书总编辑部出版了一本介绍中国情形的专著，这本书得到了苏联社会各界的高度评价。这本书的编辑和出版，是苏中两国学者共同从事创造性劳动的成果，也是两国学者富有成效的科学合作的一个范例，这种合作为了我们两国人民的福利正在日益发展和巩固着。
    在富丽堂皇的国立莫斯科大学的新校舍和许多其他苏联高等学校的讲堂里、研究室和实验室里，兄弟中国的人民的优秀儿女同苏联学生在一起学习着。在苏联各高等学校学习的中国青年男女留学生，个个都是坚毅、勤劳，热爱自己伟大的祖国，他们顺利地掌握着科学的高度成就，毫无疑问，他们一定会成为各个经济和文化部门的优秀专家而回到自己自由幸福的祖国。
    在人民中国，大家广泛地学习和掌握苏联工农业革新者所取得的成就，我们苏联人民由于我们中国弟兄在为新中国的经济和文化繁荣的斗争中，运用我国工农业先进工作者的经验和成就，运用苏联学者、文化和艺术工作者的经验和成就，而感到衷心的高兴。
    广泛实行着的互派文化代表团的措施，对于加强我们两国的文化联系事业起着重大的作用。我们可以怀着感谢的心情指出，最近应苏联对外文化协会邀请访问了苏联的中苏友好协会代表团的团员们，不仅对苏联人民的生活进行了了解，而且还积极地向苏联各界做了讲演和报告，向苏联人民介绍中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的领导下所取得的各项成就。
    只是一九五四年五、六月访问苏联的中苏友好协会代表团的团员们，就在莫斯科、列宁格勒、巴库和新西伯利亚等地做了四十余次讲演和报告，深受苏联各界人民的欢迎。
    苏联的艺术团体和个别的演出者到中国演出，中华人民共和国的演员们到苏联演出，都愈来愈频繁了。中国人民解放军歌舞团在苏联许多城市进行了演出。歌舞团全体天才演出者的高度演出技巧，受到苏联观众的热烈欢迎。苏联人民通过歌舞团向英勇的中国人民解放军和兄弟般的中国人民表达了热烈的祝贺。
    十二月二十日在莫斯科“电影工作者之家”隆重地举行了第二次中华人民共和国电影展览的开幕典礼。苏联观众在莫斯科各大电影院怀着巨大的兴趣看了“斩断魔爪”、“鸡毛信”、“龙须沟”等中国新影片。在莫斯科、各加盟共和国的首都以及苏联其他城市举行第二次中国电影展览的期间里，一共放映了十八部中国故事影片和纪录影片。看过这些影片的千百万苏联人民，对兄弟的中国人民的生活有了更加深入的了解。
    中国作家的著作译成了俄文和苏联各民族文字，其发行册数日益增加。苏联读者对鲁迅、郭沫若、丁玲、赵树理等杰出的中国作家和诗人的创作是熟悉、热爱并珍视的。
    一九五四年在莫斯科出版了伟大中国人民艺术天才的不朽的著作——罗贯中的长篇小说“三国演义”，这部小说是第一次译成俄文出版的。
    苏中两国友好文化合作的这几种方式以及其他许多方式，更加发展和巩固着苏中两国人民相互间的真挚的友谊感情。
    中苏友好协会在加强我们两国人民之间的友好和文化合作方面有着重大的作用。中苏友好协会成立五年来，在加强苏联同中华人民共和国的友好关系方面进行了巨大的、富有成果的工作。
    在这里，我想特别指出中苏友好协会在向苏联各界介绍中国人民的和平劳动、生活和文化成就方面所做的巨大的工作。苏联对外文化协会以及其他苏联机关团体，经常从中苏友好协会收到新的文艺作品、最流行的中国音乐歌谱、照片、展览图片以及其他向苏联人民介绍中国人民生活的资料。
    现在，在莫斯科的普希金博物馆正在举行卓越的中国工艺美术展览会，这个展览会是中苏友好协会总会和中华人民共和国文化部共同筹备的。莫斯科人满怀热情参观这个展览会，对它发生巨大的兴趣。
    不久以前中苏友好协会赠送苏联一套“向社会主义迈进的新中国”的展览照片，苏联对外文化协会把这套图片加洗复制，在莫斯科、列宁格勒、明斯克和巴库等四个城市同时进行了展出。
    苏联人民深切关心中华人民共和国生活的各个方面。他们每当听到伟大的中国人民在争取自己的光明幸福的未来的英勇斗争中获得成就的新消息时，就会感到衷心的高兴，他们热烈地希望中国兄弟们在建设社会主义的道路上取得新的伟大成就。
    苏联劳动人民确信，中国人民在自己的久经考验和战斗锻炼的共产党的领导下，必将顺利地完成摆在他们前面的在自己的美丽祖国内进行社会主义改造的任务，并且把城乡劳动人民的物质和文化福利提高到空前的高度。
    亲爱的同志们！
    请允许我来宣读苏联对外文化协会理事会委托我们向中苏友好协会第二次全国代表会转达的贺词：致中苏友好协会第二次全国代表会的参加者们。亲爱的朋友和同志们！
    苏联对外文化协会理事会谨向代表会的参加者，并且通过你们向中苏友好协会全体会员，致衷心的兄弟的敬礼！
    牢不可破的兄弟友谊，把伟大的苏联人民和伟大的中华人民共和国人民团结在一起。这种友谊是我们两国人民繁荣的源泉和保证世界和平的强大力量。
    中苏友好协会在扩展和加深我们两国之间的兄弟般的合作方面所进行的巨大而富有成效的工作，对于进一步巩固牢不可破地苏中友好的事业，作着宝贵的贡献。
    我们热烈地、衷心地希望中苏友好协会，在为了我们两国人民的幸福所作的崇高工作中获得更大的成就。
    伟大的中国人民日益繁荣，万岁！
    苏中两国人民的永恒的牢不可破的兄弟友谊——世界和平的强有力的因素日益发展，万岁！
