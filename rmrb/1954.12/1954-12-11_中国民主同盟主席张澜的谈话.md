I completely endorse Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. Everyone knows that Taiwan is China's sacred territory, Chiang Kai-shek is a public enemy of the Chinese people, and liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the sacred responsibility of the Chinese people to exercise their sovereignty and safeguard their territorial integrity. The US imperialism has abandoned international credibility, violated the "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation" it signed, and vainly attempts to "indefinitely" occupy China's territory Taiwan by concluding a so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This is the most blatant and shameless manifestation of its hostility towards the Chinese people and its preparation to expand its war of aggression.

Since the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, US imperialism has been unwilling to accept the failure of its imperialist policy in China and has adopted a consistent policy of aggression hostile to the Chinese people. In recent years, it has carried out a war of aggression in Korea, occupied our territory Taiwan, and interfered in the colonial war in Indochina, vainly attempting to encircle our country from these three fronts; it has cobbled together aggressive military blocs in the Asia-Pacific region, established military bases, and tried to rearm Japan, making the situation in the Asia-Pacific region increasingly tense. It was only through the joint efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union, and other countries that the flames of the US aggressors were contained, and the wars in Korea and Indochina were peacefully resolved, and the international situation tended to ease. However, the US imperialists have not learned from their failures, and have continued to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea, undermine the implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement, and direct the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to intensify its war activities against our country. Now, they have further disregarded the public anger of peace-loving people all over the world and blatantly signed the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to "legalize" the US imperialist occupation of China's territory Taiwan, use force to support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's criminal actions of invading the mainland, and prepare for a larger-scale war. This clearly makes the Far East situation even more tense. This shows that the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is an open provocation by US imperialism against the Chinese people. It not only threatens peace in the Far East, but also threatens world peace.

The Chinese people love peace, but they are not afraid of war; in order to defend peace, in order to defend their territory and sovereignty, the Chinese people are willing to pay any price to strive for it. The US imperialists vainly attempt to intimidate us with war, but they have not expected that the Chinese people who have stood up will never be intimidated by war. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said well in his statement: "The Chinese people resolutely oppose war, but will never be intimidated by the threat of war." "The Chinese people fervently demand peace, but will never beg for peace at the cost of their territory and sovereignty." This just and stern statement is supported by peace-loving people all over the world. The firm will of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan will not be shaken in the slightest by this arrogant act of aggression by US imperialism, it will only promote the closer unity of our people throughout the country to redouble their efforts to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique!

    中国民主同盟主席张澜的谈话
    我完全拥护周恩来外交部长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明。美国政府同蒋介石卖国集团签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。谁都知道：台湾是中国神圣的领土，蒋介石是中国人民的公敌，解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团是中国人民行使自己的主权和维护领土完整的神圣责任。美帝国主义背弃国际信义，破坏它自己签过字的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”，妄想通过同蒋介石卖国集团缔订所谓“共同防御条约”来
  “无限期”地霸占中国领土台湾，这是它敌视中国人民、准备扩大侵略战争的最露骨最无耻的表现。
    中国人民革命胜利以后，美帝国主义不甘心于它的帝国主义政策在中国的失败，采取了一贯与中国人民为敌的侵略政策。几年来，它在朝鲜进行侵略战争，侵占我国领土台湾，干涉印度支那的殖民战争，妄想从这三个战线上包围我国；在亚洲和太平洋地区拼凑侵略军事集团，建立军事基地，力图重新武装日本，使亚洲和太平洋区域的局势日益紧张。只是由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、中国和苏联以及其他各国的共同努力，遏阻了美国侵略者的凶焰，才使朝鲜和印度支那的战争得以和平解决，国际局势趋于缓和。但是美帝国主义者并未接受失败的教训，仍一贯阻挠朝鲜的和平统一，破坏印度支那停战协议的贯彻实施，指使蒋介石卖国集团加紧对我国进行战争活动。现在更进一步不顾全世界和平人民的公愤，明目张胆地同蒋介石卖国集团签订美蒋“共同防御条约”，企图使美帝国主义对中国领土台湾的霸占“合法化”，用武力支持蒋介石卖国集团进犯大陆的罪恶行动，并准备更大规模的战争。这显然使远东局势更形紧张。这说明美蒋“共同防御条约”是美帝国主义对中国人民的公开挑衅，它不仅威胁到远东的和平，同时也威胁到世界的和平。
    中国人民是爱好和平的，但是决不害怕战争；为了保卫和平，为了保卫自己的领土和主权，中国人民是不惜付出一切的代价去争取的。美帝国主义者妄想用战争来威吓我们，它没有料到已经站了起来的中国人民决不是战争所能吓倒的。周恩来外长声明中说得好：“中国人民坚决地反对战争，但是决不会被战争威胁吓倒”。“中国人民热烈地要求和平，但是决不会拿自己的领土和主权作代价乞求和平”。这一义正辞严的声明是全世界爱好和平的人民所支持的。中国人民解放台湾的坚强意志决不会因美帝国主义这一狂妄的侵略行动而有丝毫的动摇，它只有促进我全国人民更紧密地团结一致，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团而加倍努力！
