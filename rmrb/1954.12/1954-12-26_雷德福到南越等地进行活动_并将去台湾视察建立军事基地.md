    【新华社二十三日讯】根据西方通讯社报道：美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福在二十一日到达印度支那活动。雷德福在到西贡以前，曾在巴黎参加美英法三国关于印度支那政策的商谈。他到印度支那活动，被认为和目前美国加紧把南越变为美国的军事基地的阴谋有关。
    雷德福在二十一日飞到西贡后，即和美国驻南越特使柯林斯、美国驻印度支那军事援助顾问团团长奥丹尼尔进行会谈。当天，他曾飞往柬埔寨首都金边，并在第二天返回西贡继续和美国高级官员商谈。
    雷德福在到西贡之前曾在喀喇蚩和曼谷停留过。在曼谷，他曾和泰国官员会谈，并听取了美国驻泰国军事顾问团的汇报。
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日讯：据“纽约邮报”驻华盛顿记者罗伯特·艾伦报道，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福海军上将在访问台湾时，将要视察和选择建筑美国陆军和空军军事基地的地点。艾伦指出，军事基地的建筑，将根据不久以前美国和蒋介石缔结的条约进行。
    艾伦的报道还说，美国参谋长联席会议还主张同南越和泰国缔结类似美蒋条约的“共同防御条约”。
