    The Crane Operator
    By our reporter, Lu Hao
    Ever since he heard that a large bridge was going to be built over the Yangtze River, Kuang Yongfu began thinking of going there.

    He was originally a crane operator at the Wuchang ferry terminal. There were eighteen people working with him, responsible for managing the flat girder at the dock. Their job was to raise the flat girder when the water rose and lower it when the water fell. If the Yangtze River did not change significantly, there was not much work for them to do. There was very little work in February and August, and even less in winter. The busiest time of the year was only about a month or so.

    It just so happened that the engineering bureau responsible for building the Yangtze River Bridge needed crane operators, and Kuang Yongfu learned of this news.

    Kuang Yongfu's leaders initially agreed that they could consider it, but later said they needed to study it, but there were no results.

    "If you don't let us go, we're going to give you our opinions," Kuang Yongfu requested several times without getting an answer. He said almost angrily.

      "It's not that I'm not letting you go. If you leave, what will happen to the work here?"

      "Of course, the work will not be affected."

      "How can it not be affected?"

    "At least one-third of our people can leave." Kuang Yongfu explained, "If the remaining work gets busy, we can hire temporary workers."

    "If you can really ensure that the work is not affected by your departure, you can go." The person in charge finally agreed.

    During the meeting of the crane operators, Kuang Yongfu said, "Everyone wants to go to build the Yangtze River Bridge, but let's not fight over it. Let's discuss how many people our work needs and how many people can leave. Who can leave should be decided by the higher authorities."

    The result of their discussion was that out of the original eighteen people, seven could leave. For more than a month of the year it would be busier, but the problem could be solved by hiring four temporary workers during that time.

    The seven workers in the crane operator team, including Kuang Yongfu, were finally approved to participate in the construction of the Hanshui Bridge. From the beginning, Kuang Yongfu moved his family to the construction site.

    At that time, the pile driving had just started on the shore of the Hanshui Bridge, and it was winter. The cold air from the Hanshui River could penetrate your cotton coat. The rain was drizzling incessantly. The crane operators climbed on the high iron frames of the universal pile drivers, which were slippery and cold. The thread gloves on their hands would stick to the iron frames in no time.

    At that time, the pile driving record was more than twenty meters per shift.

    Sun Baochai, who worked with Kuang Yongfu, made a plan to drive sixty meters per shift to compete with Kuang Yongfu.

    An old worker who knew about Sun Baochai's new pile driving plan did not believe it. He said, "If they can drive sixty meters, I'll sit on it with my bottom."

    Of course, things were very difficult. The weather was very cold. When joining piles, people had to work in the mud and water rushing out of the water injection pipe. The mud and water were mixed with sand, like small hailstones hitting your head. It soaked all the cotton clothes on people's bodies, and people's faces were covered with mud and water, looking like they had just come out of a coal mine.

    Kuang Yongfu was supposed to start work at eleven o'clock at night, but he always came to the pile driving site at two o'clock in the afternoon. He would come to see how the previous shift was joining the pipes, how they were joining the piles and pouring asphalt, how they were tightening the screws...

    After a few days, Kuang Yongfu's team had already reached a record of fifty-four meters per shift. The union at the construction site saw that Kuang Yongfu's team was determined to drive sixty meters, so they quickly prepared a flag to reward them. As soon as the flag was made, Kuang Yongfu's team really drove sixty meters.

    Just as they were handing over the shift, the comrades from the union sent them a red flag of victory with gongs and drums. Sun Baochai's team had just finished work. When they saw the union sending a red flag to Kuang Yongfu's team, they also applauded together. Sun Baochai even led everyone in excitedly shouting the slogan "Learn from Kuang Yongfu's team."

    Two days later, Sun Baochai's team reached a new record of sixty-two meters of pile driving per shift.

    The new pile driving records kept being broken, and the union almost didn't have enough time to make red flags.

    Soon, Kuang Yongfu's team caught up again, and they reached seventy-two meters of pile driving per shift. When Sun Baochai's team drove eighty-two meters per shift, Kuang Yongfu's team drove ninety-two meters. The entire construction site was buzzing.

    As the pile driving on the shore was coming to an end, Kuang Yongfu's team reached the highest record of one hundred meters of pile driving per shift. Once, after their shift reached the record of one hundred meters, there were still twenty minutes left before the end of the shift. They immediately began to help the next shift, Sun Baochai's team, to prepare for pile driving: they pre-connected the pipe piles and water injection pipes, bundled the jacks, and hung the hoists. When Sun Baochai's team came up to take over, they could lift the steam hammer and start pile driving. This time, Sun Baochai's team also drove one hundred meters.

    Next, the underwater foundation work began.

    Continuous gales and heavy rain, without stopping for a moment, seemed to be coming to join the fun. People wearing two raincoats would be soaked through in no time, and the wind was so strong that it seemed to blow people away. What was particularly annoying was that the flood was about to arrive.

    Just now, you could walk from the springboard to the pier to work. When you came back later, one end of the springboard was soaked in the water by the rising flood. As long as you raised the springboard a little higher, it wouldn't take long before the springboard was washed away again. If you wanted to go to the pier in the afternoon, you had to take a small boat, because the springboard had lost its function.

    The flood was coming soon.

    The wooden caisson of Pier No. 5 was being pumped dry. This huge object, as tall as four or five stories, now stood proudly in the middle of the rapids. The Hanshui River seemed to be using all its strength to frantically impact it. The head of water was two or three feet high, and every square meter was subjected to the pressure of several tons of water.

    People working inside the wooden caisson seemed to have entered another world. They were like in a cave, hearing the howling Hanshui River, making a rushing sound like a waterfall. The sound was so loud that they couldn't hear each other speak. Rainwater and leaks from the wooden caisson were mixed together, and people seemed to be working while soaking in the water.

    As most of the water in the wooden caisson was being pumped out, the pressure of the Hanshui River almost made the entire wooden caisson tremble. Supports thicker than roof beams were deeply driven into the walls of the wooden caisson like drills. Some places were creaking under pressure, and individual pine wood supports larger than railroad ties were broken.

    Where the wood broke, someone immediately reinforced it. Two 300-horsepower pumps were pumping water non-stop. Crane operators, steelworkers, and carpenters were working busily. Sometimes the pump was accidentally blocked by wood chips, and the water in the wooden caisson would flood up in a moment, submerging up to the front of the thighs. Some people had to stand in the water to work.

    Three days after the concrete was poured for Pier No. 5, the flood submerged the eighteen-meter-high wooden caisson. At this time, the pier had just been rescued two meters above the water surface.

    The workers had not had a good rest for a long time. One day, the Wuhan Peking Opera Troupe came to the construction site to perform a consolation show. The leaders of the construction site issued a notice: Everyone must watch the show tonight.

    After Kuang Yongfu received this notice, he made a suggestion. He said that they were moving a wooden cage from one pier to another, and it would only take more than an hour to finish. If they didn't move it, that pier could not start work. They asked to be allowed to finish their work before watching the show.

    The leaders of the construction site found it difficult to refuse this enthusiastic request. So they agreed to them, and at the same time told them: "After you finish, be sure to come and watch the show."

    It was already dark, and the bright lights on the construction site illuminated the muddy Hanshui River, making it transparent and luminous. One crane boat after another was towed over by small steamers, and the steel ropes were released from the crane boats with a whirring sound. The crane operators tied up the wooden cage.

    When the wooden cage was about to come out of the water, suddenly a two-inch thick pine wood cracked. The two crane boats dared not lift it, nor dared to lower it. This shocked the crane operators.

    The wooden cage was suspended on the water, and the Hanshui River splashed high waves as it beat against it. Kuang Yongfu agilely jumped onto the wooden cage to inspect it, and then jumped into the water with everyone. Some took hammers, some sawed wood...

    After the wooden cage was reinforced, the crane boat lifted it onto the iron barge and successfully sent it to another pier before they came ashore. However, the Wuhan Peking Opera Troupe's Peking Opera evening was almost over.

    装吊工
    本报记者　陆灏
    自从听说长江上要造大桥，匡永福就开始想到那里去。
    他本来是武昌轮渡码头上的一个装吊工。和他在一起工作的有十八个人，负责管理着码头上的平板梁。他们的工作是：涨水了，把平板梁起高；水落了，要降低。如果长江的水没有显著的变化，他们能做的工作也就不多。二月八月工作很少，冬季更闲，一年最忙的时间，总共也不过个把月。
    恰巧负责修建长江大桥的工程局正需要装吊工人，这消息被匡永福知道了。
    匡永福的领导人开始答应他们可以考虑考虑，后来又说要研究研究，但一直没有结果。
    “你再不放我们去，我们要给你提意见了。”匡永福连续地请求了几次仍然没有得到答应，他几乎是愤激地说。
      “我不是不让你们去。你们走了，这里的工作怎么办？”
      “当然不会使工作受影响。”
      “怎么能不受影响？”
    “我们的人至少可走三分之一。”匡永福解释说：“剩下的工作如果忙的话，可以请临时工做。”
    “你们如果真能做到走了人不影响工作，你们可以去。”那位负责人总算答应了。
    在装吊工们开会的时候，匡永福说：“大家都想去修长江大桥，可是咱们谁也不要争，咱们商量一下，咱们的工作需要几个人，可以走几个人。谁可以走，由上级去决定。”
    他们商量的结果是：原来十八个人，可以走七个人，一年内有一个多月会忙一些，那段时间再雇四个临时工就可以解决问题。
    装吊班的七个工人，包括匡永福在内，终于被批准参加汉水大桥的建设了。匡永福在一开始，他就把家也搬到工地上来了。
    那时候，汉水桥的岸上刚开始打桩，时间正是冬季，汉水河面上的冷气，还能穿透你的棉袄。雨，缠绵地下着，装吊工们爬在高高的万能打桩机的铁架上，又滑又冻，手上戴着的线手套，一会儿就粘在铁架上了。
    当时，打桩的纪录是每班打二十多公尺。
    和匡永福同时工作的孙宝财，订了一个每班打六十公尺的计划要和匡永福比赛。
    有个老工人知道了孙宝财的打桩新计划，他不相信。他说：“要是他们能打到六十公尺，我一屁股就把它坐下去了。”
    事情当然是很困难的。天气很冷，接桩的时候，人们得冒着射水管里冲激出来的泥水工作，泥水里夹杂着砂子，像小小的冰雹似地打在你的头上，它把人们身上的棉衣全部浇湿了，人们的脸孔被泥水糊得像从煤井里上来的一样。
    匡永福本来应该晚上十一点钟上班，可是他总是在下午两点多钟就到打桩的工地来了。他来看看上一班怎样接管子？怎样接桩浇沥青？怎样上下螺丝……。
    过了几天，匡永福的那个小组每班就已经打到五十四公尺的纪录了。工地的工会看匡永福这个组非打六十公尺不可，他们就赶紧准备一面奖励他们的旗子，等到旗子刚做好，匡永福小组真的已经打到了六十公尺。
    正当他们交接班的时候，工会的同志们就打着锣鼓给他们送去了优胜的红旗。孙宝财那个小组刚刚下班，他们见工会给匡永福小组送来了红旗，也
  一齐鼓掌，孙宝财还领着大家兴奋地喊着“向匡永福小组学习”的口号。
    两天以后，孙宝财的小组每班打桩达到了六十二公尺的新纪录。
    打桩的新纪录，一个赶一个，工会做红旗都几乎有点来不及了。
    不久，匡永福小组又追上去了，他们每班打桩达到了七十二公尺。在孙宝财小组每班打到八十二公尺的时候，匡永福小组又打到了九十二公尺。整个的工地都沸腾了。
    在岸上打桩快要结束的时候，匡永福小组达到了每班打桩一百公尺的最高纪录。有一次，他们那一班打到一百公尺的纪录以后，到下班还有二十分钟，他们马上开始帮助下一班孙宝财的小组做好打桩的准备工作：他们预先把管桩和射水管接好，把千斤捆好，葫芦挂好，等到孙宝财那个小组一上来接班，他们吊起汽锤就可以开始打桩。这一次，孙宝财小组也打到了一百公尺。
    接着，水下的基础工程开始了。
    连续的恶风恶雨，片刻不停，它好像也来赶热闹。人们穿两件雨衣，一会儿就把你淋透了，大风真像要把人都刮走似的。特别讨厌的是眼看洪水就要来到了。
    刚才，还可以从跳板上走过去到桥墩上工作，等一会回来，跳板的一头就被涨上来的洪水浸在水里了。只要再把跳板垫高一点，要不了多少时间，跳板就又被冲走了。下午如果要到墩址上去，就必须坐小船，因为跳板已经失去了作用。
    洪水很快就要来到了。
    五号桥墩的木沉井正在抽水，这个相当四、五层楼那样高的庞然大物现在傲然地矗立在激流的中间。汉水好像是用了全部力量在疯狂地冲击它。水头有两三尺高，每一平方公尺经受着数吨水的压力。
    在木沉井里面工作的人，好像是到了另外一个世界。他们像在一个山洞里，听见呼啸着的汉水，像瀑布般地发出奔腾的声音，这声音喧闹得使彼此说话都听不见。雨水和木沉井的漏水溶在一起，人们好像是泡在水里面工作一样。
    当木沉井里的水大部将被抽掉，汉水的压力几乎把整个木沉井冲击得颤抖起来，比房梁还要粗的支撑，像个钻子那样深深地顶入木沉井的板壁里去了。有些地方被压得格格发响，个别比枕木还要大的松木支撑竟被压断了。
    木头断了的地方，马上有人在加固。两部三百马力的抽水机片刻不停地抽水。装吊工、钢筋工、木工，忙碌地工作着。抽水机有时偶然被木屑堵住了，木沉井里的水一会儿就漫上来，淹到大腿跟前，有的人只好站在水里面工作。
    在第五号桥墩的混凝土浇灌好三天以后，洪水就把十八公尺高的木沉井淹没了。这时候桥墩刚刚抢出了水面两公尺。
    工人们已经很长时间没有好好休息了。有一天，武汉市京剧团来到工地举行慰问演出。工地的领导同志下了一个通知：今天晚上大家一定要看戏。
    匡永福接到这个通知以后，他提了个意见。他说他们正在把一个木笼从一个桥墩移到另外一个桥墩去，只要一个多钟头，就可以结束了。如果不移，那个桥墩就不能开始工作。他们请求让他们结束了工作再去看戏。
    工地的领导同志很难拒绝这种热情的请求。于是就答应了他们，同时嘱咐他们说：“弄完以后，一定都来看戏。”
    天已经黑了，工地上耀亮的灯光把浑浊的汉水照射得透明发光。吊船一只一只被小火轮拖过来了，钢绳从吊船上呜呜呜地放下来，装吊工们把木笼系起来。
    在木笼将出水面还没有出水面的时候，突然间有一根两公寸厚的松木裂开了，两只吊船不敢吊，也不敢放，这把装吊工们惊住了。
    那木笼悬在水面上，汉水拍打着它溅出高高的浪花。匡永福灵捷地跳到木笼上去检查，随即又和大家一齐跳到水里去，有的拿锤子，有的锯木头……
    等到木笼加固好，吊船把它吊到铁驳上顺利送向另外一个桥墩以后，他们才上了岸。可是，武汉市京剧团的京剧晚会已经快结束了。
