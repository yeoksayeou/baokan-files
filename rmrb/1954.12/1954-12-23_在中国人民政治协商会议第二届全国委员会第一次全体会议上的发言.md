At the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Bo Yongbo, a member of the committee, delivered a speech.

Chairman, fellow committee members, and comrades:

I fully agree with the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai and the work report by Vice Chairman Chen Chutong on the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's First National Committee. I have studied the draft of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's charter and found it excellent. From these reports and the charter, we can clearly understand the current international and domestic situations and future tasks and guidelines. With the charter in place, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will be able to better mobilize and unite the people of the entire country to complete the tasks of the transitional period, based on its past experiences of mobilizing and uniting the people to carry out various great reforms and construction projects. I believe this is achievable.

In the past, our Political Consultative Conference adopted the Common Program, which served as a provisional constitution, and exercised the functions of the People's Congress. It established the Central People's Government and founded the People's Republic of China. Simultaneously, it elected its National Committee to carry out its political tasks. Over the past five years, the people of the entire country, under the leadership of the Chinese working class and its party—the Communist Party of China, achieved a complete victory in the War of Liberation. They eliminated the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits on the mainland and, one victory after another, carried out great movements such as land reform, resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Antis" and "Five-Antis," and the restoration of the national economy. Since 1953, we have entered a phase of planned, large-scale socialist economic construction. Consequently, our country's international status and the level of awareness and organization of the people have reached unprecedented heights, and people's lives have significantly improved, making the people's democratic government, led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, even more consolidated. All these great achievements are inseparable from the efforts of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It is particularly worth noting that every member of our People's Political Consultative Conference, after being tempered and tested by various great movements over the past five years, and after five years of planned and organized study of Marxism-Leninism and ideological transformation, has significantly raised their level of awareness and political understanding, making our people's democratic united front even more consolidated. In his closing speech at the Second Plenary Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao pointed out three "passes" we must go through. Today, we can say that the first and second passes have been successfully navigated, and the third pass has begun. I believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we will overcome difficulties and successfully navigate through it.

Now, as we are going through the third pass, it is meaningful to recall how we navigated through the previous passes. Everyone remembers that when the revolutionary people were bravely fighting the War of Liberation and were about to achieve national victory, the imperialists spread rumors that we could not achieve national victory, and even if we did, we could not consolidate it. The imperialists' rumors have been completely exposed in reality; however, what was our collective mindset at that time? Did everyone have unwavering confidence in the Chinese people's victory in the war and the consolidation of that victory? In "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Chairman Mao summarized the experiences of the Chinese people's revolution. Apart from providing clear instructions on the issue of democratic dictatorship, he also pointed out that to achieve victory and consolidate it, we must lean to one side. That is, we must lean towards the side of socialism and oppose the Kuomintang reactionaries who lean towards the side of imperialism. In fact, this is what we did. We have formed a strong peace and democracy front with the Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and the broad masses of other countries, thereby changing the face of the world. If we look at it from an ideological perspective, did everyone have a clear understanding of the need to lean towards the side of socialism at that time? Did everyone have no illusions about the third path? When the U.S. imperialists launched the aggression against Korea, pushing to the Yalu River, attempting to bring the war into our territory, and occupying our territory of Taiwan, we issued the "Joint Declaration of All Democratic Parties" based on the demands of the people of the entire country, launching the great patriotic struggle of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend the motherland. Relying on the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, we quickly exposed the U.S. imperialists' paper tiger, drove their invading army back to the 38th parallel, and finally achieved the victory of the Korean armistice. If we look at it from an ideological perspective, did everyone, at that time, have a clear understanding of the ferocious face of U.S. imperialism? Did everyone have a true understanding of the paper tiger posture of U.S. imperialism? I believe that these questions may have existed to some extent in the minds of some people. Through the People's Liberation War and the People's Democratic Revolution, especially the subsequent resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, through exposing the facts of U.S. imperialism's consistent aggression against our country and hostility towards our people, and through receiving profound patriotic and internationalist education, those who were previously unclear about the enemy lines in their minds gradually recognized that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and understood the principle of "leaning to one side." As the saying goes, "Those who do not forget the past will be teachers of the future." We can benefit greatly from learning lessons from these facts.

Let us recall the ideological situation during the land reform. Everyone knows that land reform is the abolition of the land ownership system of the landlord class, the establishment of the land ownership system of the peasants, the liberation of rural productive forces, the development of agricultural production, and the opening of the way for the industrialization of our country. This is a great revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. We all participated in or observed the land reform movement. In such a great movement, we realized the truth of serving the people, relying on the people, and following the mass line, thereby improving our attitude of serving the people and recognizing that revolutionary practice is the most effective method of transforming thoughts and correcting standpoints. However, in the early stages of land reform in our country, there was such a saying: "China does not have very large landlords." This means that China does not have a land problem. When the land reform movement began, some people were concerned about "excessive" actions here and "leftist" tendencies there. At that time, some people thought that the government should issue a notice, asking landlords to hand over their land, and there was no need for the peasants to take action themselves. This is an illusion that without mobilizing the masses to fight, we can peacefully eliminate the feudal exploitation system that has existed for thousands of years. Such thoughts were not accepted by everyone. Today, land reform, relying on the mobilization of the peasant masses, has been successfully completed nationwide; due to the victory of the land reform movement, productivity has significantly increased, agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation have flourished, rural areas have further democratized, and the worker-peasant alliance has been further consolidated. These are facts that everyone can see. In the face of these facts, let us recall the ideological dynamics and their development process at that time, which will be helpful to us as we navigate through the third pass.

Now we are navigating through the third pass. Chairman Mao once encouraged everyone: "As long as we have passed the war pass and the land reform pass, the remaining pass will be easier to pass." If we deeply understand that "two different revolutionary processes, only after completing the first revolutionary process can we go on to complete the second revolutionary process. The democratic revolution is a necessary preparation for the socialist revolution, and the socialist revolution is the inevitable trend of the democratic revolution," then based on our existing experiences in ideological transformation, we should be able to easily navigate through the third pass through the peaceful transformation path to a happy socialist society. However, we must face the socialist transformation, which is to gradually eliminate the exploitation system in a manner suitable for the development of our national economy. This is not an easy task. Our constitution stipulates that "the state adopts the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce," which is a policy recognized by everyone as correct, but some people think that "utilizing" sounds too bad, "restricting" sounds too unfree, and "transforming" sounds too dishonorable. Again, the constitution stipulates that the state "takes the development of production cooperatives as the main path for transforming individual agriculture and individual handicrafts." Individual economy in the national economy, through mutual aid and cooperation, achieves collectivization. This is the necessary path for individual laborers to get rid of poverty. However, the vast majority of individual peasants and individual handicraftsmen are accustomed to small-scale production and accustomed to the old path. It will take a considerable period of hard work to fully recognize the superiority of collective production, using simple theories and vivid facts to persuade them to believe. Moreover, the basic task of our first five-year plan is to concentrate our main efforts on developing heavy industry. However, some people think that it would be better to develop light industry first; or some people think that the state should develop heavy industry, while private individuals should handle light industry. This shows that our thoughts on these fundamental issues were not completely consistent from the beginning. Through the help of this organization, we have studied and researched, and our thoughts on certain issues, which were not consistent at the beginning, gradually have the possibility of becoming consistent. This means that navigating through the third pass still requires our collective efforts. Under the leadership of the National Committee of the Political Consultative Conference, we have studied the general line and the constitution, especially the practice of socialist transformation over the past two years, and our understanding of the problem of building a socialist society has been further improved.

All experiences prove that political and ideological unity is the foundation of our solidarity. To achieve political and ideological unity, we must go deep into the masses and improve ourselves through practice; we must use the Common Program in the past and the constitution in the future as standards, adopt the method of criticism and self-criticism, insist on truth, correct errors, and seriously carry out self-education and self-transformation work. These are all regulated in the preamble of the charter, and we will surely abide by it after passing the charter.

Due to the promulgation of the constitution, building a happy and prosperous socialist society has become the common goal of the people of the entire country. Therefore, the socialist transformation pass, we are navigating through it and have not yet completed it, the brightness of the future is undoubted. Of course, there will still be many difficulties on our way forward, especially the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices will certainly do everything they can to obstruct and sabotage our great socialist construction. The signing of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty is a very obvious example of attempting to hinder us from building socialism on our complete territory. However, Taiwan is Chinese territory and must be liberated; no difficulties can frighten us, and we must move forward. I hope that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, based on the charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that will be passed, we will have firm confidence, overcome difficulties, continue to work hard on ideological transformation, strengthen unity, and strive to implement the constitution and complete the tasks of the transitional period.

Li Jishen, Vice Chairman, delivered a speech.

Chairman, fellow committee members:

The first plenary session of the second national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was solemnly opened under the personal chairmanship of Chairman Mao. We have listened to the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou and the work report by the first national committee, as well as the explanation of the draft charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I represent the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang to express our complete agreement and support. Regarding the draft charter and the seven common principles in the preamble, we will definitely adhere to and actively implement them.

Over the past five years, the first national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, has broadly united various ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and patriotic democrats from all walks of life. In mobilizing the people to assist the government in completing various tasks, we have done a lot of work and played an important role. The convening of this plenary session of the second national committee marks the further expansion of the unity of all ethnic groups and classes in the country, the concentration of forces, and the further consolidation and development of the broad people's democratic united front.

The preamble of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China points out: "In the future, in the mobilization and unity of the people of the entire country to complete the tasks of the transitional period and the struggle against internal and external enemies, our people's democratic united front will continue to play its role." Now our task is to further mobilize and unite the people of the entire country, assist the government, implement the constitution, and strive to build a great socialist state, defend the integrity of the territory and sovereignty of the motherland, oppose aggressive wars, and strive for peace in Asia and the world.

U.S. imperialism is unwilling to accept defeat on the mainland of China and has consistently been hostile to the Chinese people, supporting the Kuomintang traitor group to occupy Taiwan and harass our mainland. Recently, it has gone even further by signing the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty," openly occupying our territory, violating our sovereignty, interfering in our internal affairs, and challenging the Chinese people.

The Chinese people love peace but will not tolerate aggression; the Chinese people oppose war but are not afraid of military threats. We express great indignation at the serious crimes of U.S. imperialism. We must repel the war provocations of U.S. imperialism, and we firmly oppose the absurd proposals of "Taiwan independence," "Taiwan neutrality," and "trusteeship of Taiwan" that cater to U.S. aggression policies. To maintain peace in Asia and the world, the United States must withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. Any foreign country that dares to obstruct and interfere with the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan will receive the punishment it deserves! The Chinese people have full confidence in successfully completing the tasks of liberating Taiwan and defending peace. We should strengthen our unity, strengthen our work, and exert our strength to fight to the end to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Kuomintang traitor group!

The Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang is a unit participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, together with other democratic parties, we have united our members and the masses we are connected with, and done some work in implementing national policies and laws, participating in various movements, doing our duties, and carrying out ideological transformation. In participating in revolutionary struggles, we have increasingly deeply realized that to be able to consistently follow the correct direction, overcome difficulties, seek progress, do good work, and complete tasks, we must firmly establish the thought of being led by the working class and sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China.

The revolutionary cause of the Chinese people is glorious, but it is also arduous. I believe that strengthening the leadership role of the Communist Party of China in the united front will certainly be the common wish of all units and individuals participating in this conference. We should unite more closely around the Communist Party of China and advance under the glorious banner of the great leader Mao Zedong!

Our struggle to liberate Taiwan will definitely be victorious!

Our great cause of building a socialist society will definitely be successful!

Huang Yanpei, a member of the committee, delivered a speech.

Chairman, fellow committee members, and comrades:

I represent the China Democratic National Construction Association in fully supporting the report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai.

The first plenary session of the second national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was convened shortly after the first session of the first National People's Congress passed and promulgated the Constitution of the People's Republic of China to the people of the entire country. It has a specific historical mission. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the organizational form of the people's democratic united front in our country. The preamble of the Constitution clearly states: "In the future, in the mobilization and unity of the people of the entire country to complete the tasks of the transitional period and the struggle against internal and external enemies, our people's democratic united front will continue to play its role." Therefore, how should the People's Political Consultative Conference work harder in the future according to this track?

In the future, we must—

1. Further expand the force of uniting the people of the entire country.

Chairman Mao said in his opening speech at the first session of the first National People's Congress: "All 600 million people in China should unite and strive for our common cause!" To achieve victory in the struggle against internal and external enemies, we must unite the people of the entire country; to build a great socialist state, to defend the motherland, to defend international peace, and to promote the progress of mankind, we must unite the people of the entire country.

2. More broadly reflect the opinions of the masses.

The Constitution, Article 17, states: "All state organs must rely on the masses, maintain close contact with the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, and accept the supervision of the masses." The members of the National Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference come from the masses. We rely on the masses, and the masses supervise us. On the one hand, we listen to the opinions of the masses, and on the other hand, we must reflect them to the relevant parties. The more correct and universal we reflect, the greater our contribution to the country and the people. Bringing the opinions of the masses to the state organs as much as possible, so that the state organs receive the supervision of the masses, in this way, the masses will surely contribute all their strength, which is to strengthen the work of uniting the masses.

We have come to the central government. The government says: "You are not from the masses?" The masses have opinions, and there are various situations entrusted to you to bring back, have you brought them back? When we go back, the common people say: "You are not from the central government?" The central government has many policies, laws, and measures that we, the common people, should know, and we, the common people, also want to know, have you brought them back? Only by fully reflecting the opinions of the masses can the masses feel the warmth of the government towards us, the common people! The state's affection for us, the common people! The government is our people's government, the state is our people's state, we are one family, in this way, the government and the people, the people and the people, will definitely be closer!

As members of the National Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference, our mouths should be megaphones, and our duties are also messengers. Right? Right. But that's still not enough. All the thoughts and opinions in our minds must also be poured out, we must strive to speak without reservation, speak without reservation. The leadership is expecting us, demanding that we do this, maybe the common people are still complaining about why we don't do this, our "brain box" should not be sealed, thinking that we are cautious and experienced!

We must recognize: the People's Political Consultative Conference has already done this in the past. The people from top to bottom have already treated each other more sincerely. In the future, everyone should do it more thoroughly and fully, with all their heart and soul for the cause of socialist construction.

I am participating as a representative of the China Democratic National Construction Association. From the perspective of the China Democratic National Construction Association, its main mission is:

1. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, unite and educate the Chinese national bourgeoisie, in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state, combine enterprise transformation with personal transformation, and represent their legitimate interests;

2. Maintain close contact with the national bourgeoisie, understand, study, and reflect their opinions and demands, promote their acceptance of socialist transformation, and oppose all illegal acts that harm public interests, disrupt social and economic order, and sabotage national economic plans;

3. Assist the government in propagating and implementing national policies and laws.

These are the specific main tasks of the China Democratic National Construction Association. To transform and develop the national economy and build a new China of socialism, the China Democratic National Construction Association must complete these specific tasks; recently, the government issued the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds to accelerate national economic construction and improve our patriotism, the China Democratic National Construction Association must complete these specific tasks; more importantly, to unite the people of the entire country, exert the irresistible power of 600 million people, to liberate our territory of Taiwan, the China Democratic National Construction Association must also complete these specific tasks.

We must strive to complete the specific tasks! We must strive together for the common cause!

Li Siguang, a member of the committee, delivered a speech.

Chairman, fellow committee members:

First of all, please allow me to represent the scientific workers of the entire country to express our agreement with the work report by Vice Chairman Chen Chutong delivered at the conference yesterday and the explanation of the draft charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference by Commissioner Zhang Boqun. We also express our heartfelt support for the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai and our respect and joy for the great achievements made by our country over the past five years under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government.

Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the government, and under the care of Chairman Mao, the scientific workers of the entire country, to implement the policy of serving the people with science and linking theory with practice, have all participated in the great construction of New China with high enthusiasm for labor in various aspects: in investigating resources on land and underground, planning the construction of industrial bases, controlling floods, improving agricultural and certain industrial production technologies, fighting against bacteriological warfare, improving medicine and hygiene, and training a large number of technical cadres, we have achieved many achievements. At the same time, in the field of scientific theory research, we have also made some contributions. The experiences of the past five years have made us deeply realize that only when the people themselves grasp the power, can the scientific cause develop so rapidly and effectively. However, the speed of its development is still far from meeting the urgent needs of the country at present. The contradiction between the large tasks and small forces is universally existing and cannot be completely overcome in a short time. This requires us, all scientific workers, to better organize and better exert all potential forces. To do these jobs well, first of all, we must clean up our own thoughts and improve our professional level.

Since liberation, we have made great progress in our self-ideological transformation and learning. The sectarianism, individual heroism, and other remnants of the past have been widely criticized in the scientific community. In the future, we still need to continue to work hard, eliminate the possible remaining influences of these bad habits, further strengthen unity, exert collective wisdom, and promote collective creation, so as to concentrate forces to more effectively solve the major and complex scientific problems in our great socialist construction.

Over the years, the Soviet Union has provided us with great selfless aid in our construction, and a large number of excellent Soviet experts have come to our country to help us with various construction work, and at the same time, they have taught us their most advanced scientific and technological experience without reservation. Our many scientific workers have not only learned a lot of advanced knowledge and skills from the Soviet experts but also have a deeper understanding of the enthusiasm of the Soviet experts and the superiority of advanced Soviet science. We must strive to learn, learn real skills to build our motherland, and strengthen the forces to defend peace to repay the sincere and lofty friendship of the Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the government of the Soviet Union.

Learning from the Soviet Union is not only to learn its modern advanced science and technology but more importantly to learn how to grasp its basic spirit. The process of the development of Soviet science tells us that only under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, that is, dialectical materialism and historical materialism, can scientific research work not fall into the wrong path. Fortunately, Chinese scientific workers have discovered this unique correct path through their own scientific research practice. Recently, many natural scientists in Beijing are preparing to organize systematic learning of dialectical materialism on a voluntary basis; at the same time, the criticism of the bourgeois idealist views of the Hu Shi faction has been widely and enthusiastically carried out in various fields of social science. There is no doubt that through this kind of learning method, it will definitely be of great help to the basic theoretical learning of our country's scientific workers; it will definitely play a great role in criticizing hidden and disguised bourgeois thoughts.

We believe that with the progress of this learning, we will definitely be able to gradually open up academic criticism and debates, eliminate the past habit of being careless and trying to sacrifice truth for "harmony," and if we believe in seeking progress through struggle and strengthening unity through struggle, then the idea that "everything is over after being criticized" is wrong.

To thoroughly solve the contradiction between the force not catching up with the task, we must seriously treat all issues related to cultivating the next generation of young cadres. This cultivation issue, to a large extent, is also inseparable from the unity issue. Young people are active, patriotic, and hardworking, but sometimes they may be a bit impatient. Today's old scientists are basically active and patriotic, and they are experienced, but they may have some conservative tendencies. In this situation, only by learning from each other can both sides make progress, and only in this way can we ensure that our unity is increasingly consolidated.

Today, the construction tasks entrusted to us by the motherland are very heavy, and the work of liberating Taiwan, stopping aggression, and defending peace also requires us to accelerate the improvement of our ideological and professional levels in various work departments. Let us, together with the people of the entire country, closely unite around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and advance to victory!

Li Dezhen, a member of the committee, delivered a speech.

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I represent the Red Cross Society of China in fully agreeing with the work report of the first national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the draft charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that will be passed at this conference. I also enthusiastically support the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has completed its historical task of acting as the National People's Congress. In the future, it will continue to play its role as a consultative body of the people's democratic united front. The Red Cross Society of China is willing to firmly abide by the various principles stipulated in the draft charter and strive to build our great socialist motherland.

The Red Cross Society of China is a people's health and rescue organization. In the past, we, based on the spirit of the Common Program, assisted the government's health departments at home to protect people's health and ensure the socialist construction of the country; internationally, we have also made some efforts to maintain world peace.

After the reorganization of the Red Cross Society of China, it immediately obtained legal status in the International Red Cross organization—the Red Cross Society Federation, and drove out the fake representatives of the Kuomintang traitor group. Over the past four years, we have attended a total of thirteen international Red Cross conferences. At each international conference, the proposals and views put forward by the Chinese Red Cross delegation on stopping various atrocities in the Korean War, opposing the use of poison gas, bacteriological weapons, atomic weapons, and hydrogen bombs, advocating the signing of a five-power peace treaty, and calling for a ceasefire in Korea and Indochina have attracted widespread attention from the international Red Cross community.

During the Korean War, the Red Cross Society of China organized seven medical and preventive teams totaling more than 600 people to provide medical and health services to the Korean people, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and prisoners of war. After the Korean ceasefire, the Red Cross Society of China also participated in the joint Red Cross small group to assist in the repatriation of prisoners of war.

In peacetime, the Red Cross Society of China attaches great importance to friendly exchanges with Red Cross societies of various countries. We believe that the mutual aid and cooperation of the Red Cross are helpful for the mutual understanding of the people of various countries. For example, the establishment of the Soviet Red Cross Hospital in Beijing is a concrete manifestation of the deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. In addition, we have donated money to help flood victims in India, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Iraq, and other countries. It is particularly worth mentioning that since last spring, the Red Cross, at the request of the government, has assisted in the return of more than 27,000 Japanese nationals in China to Japan. This matter has caused a widespread movement of thanks in Japan, which has led to the visit of the Chinese Red Cross delegation to Japan.

The Chinese Red Cross delegation to Japan conducted a 12-day friendly visit to Japan, visiting the five major cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe. We participated in various meetings 36 times, talked with 4,500 people, and met with 70,000 people. We met with Japanese royalty such as Prince Mikasa, former Minister of Health and Welfare Kusaoka Ryoken, former Minister of State Ando Masachika, and representatives from various parties, mass organizations, economic circles, cultural circles, news and publishing circles, religious circles, medical circles, overseas Chinese, and Korean residents in Japan. In our contact with various aspects of Japanese people and masses, we conveyed the friendship of the Chinese people to the Japanese people, explained that China and Japan should coexist in peace for a long time, develop economic and cultural exchanges, restore normal relations as soon as possible, and jointly strive for the maintenance of peace in Asia and the world. We received a nationwide warm welcome from the Japanese people. Osaka held a welcoming rally of more than 40,000 people, and in Tokyo alone, more than 30 organizations requested to have a dialogue with the delegation, and more than 60 organizations requested to meet with the delegation. Many regions in Japan that we did not visit also held rallies and made resolutions welcoming the delegation. Wherever the delegation went, tens of thousands of people lined the streets to welcome them, and many housewives, upon hearing the delegation's car passing by, ran out in white work clothes to wave and welcome. It is said that in Kyoto alone, 25,000 Chinese flags were sold in one day. The delegation received more than ten tons of gifts and nearly 4,000 letters from all over Japan. Some letters described their hardships; some expressed their admiration for New China and their love for Chairman Mao; some apologized for the damage caused by Japanese militarism's invasion of China; some hoped to strengthen economic and cultural exchanges between China and Japan; some missed China and hoped for free travel between the two countries. The overseas Chinese's welcome to the delegation was particularly enthusiastic, with 3,500 overseas Chinese holding a welcoming rally in Tokyo; in contrast, the Kuomintang traitor group could only buy a few hundred people to oppose the delegation, and more than half of them were deceived schoolchildren, which made them look even more ridiculous. To protect our safety, many mass organizations formed day and night patrols and guards for the delegation, which moved us greatly.

We believe that the welcome received by the delegation in Japan shows that the Japanese people eagerly look forward to establishing friendly relations with the People's Republic of China and restoring normal relations between the two countries as soon as possible, and our country's peace and friendly spirit and various specific measures have also had a profound impact on the Japanese people. More and more Japanese people are demanding friendship with China and peace.

The visit of the Red Cross Society of China to Japan has increased the Japanese people's understanding and recognition of New China, directly conveyed the friendly wishes of the Chinese people to the Japanese people, and helped to promote friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and created a good beginning for further friendly exchanges between the two countries in the future. These are all conducive to maintaining peace in Asia and the world. In the future, we are willing to work hard to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world.

When our people of the entire country are building a peaceful and happy life with full confidence, our compatriots in Taiwan are still suffering under the tyranny of the Kuomintang bandits. The United States recently signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Kuomintang traitor group, attempting to long-term occupy Taiwan with arms and expand its aggression against our country, preparing for a new war. The Red Cross Society of China, based on the principles of humanitarianism and peace, firmly supports the government's call and is ready to contribute all its strength to the liberation of Taiwan with the people of the entire country.

Chen Jingfu, a member of the committee, delivered a speech.

Chairman, fellow committee members:

After listening to the work report of the first national committee, the explanation of the draft charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, I have a deeper understanding of the great significance of the work of this conference and the great achievements of the past, and I have a deeper understanding of our great motherland's great victories in the struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world and the current direction of our efforts. I fully agree with and enthusiastically support the above reports and the draft charter, and I will strive to implement them in my own position.

We know that with the National People's Congress, the work of the People's Political Consultative Conference will not be reduced. To further unite the people of the entire country more closely to defeat the domestic and foreign reactionary enemies, the People's Political Consultative Conference needs to continue to play its role based on its past foundation. This conference was convened soon after the first session of the first National People's Congress was successfully concluded. More than 500 committee members represent the various ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democrats in the country. This is a conference to fully use the consultative method, strengthen the more consolidated unity of the people of the entire country, further exert everyone's strength, and jointly strive for socialist construction; at the same time, it is also a conference to further expand and strengthen the people's democratic united front on the basis of the consolidated unity of the people of the entire country, and strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the defense of world peace.

Over the past five years, we private industrialists and businessmen have made significant progress under the education and cultivation of the Communist Party of China and the people's government. In particular, the brilliant achievements of our great motherland on various fronts and various specific examples have powerfully educated us, making the ideological understanding of us broad industrialists and businessmen significantly improved to varying degrees. For example, the great flood in Wuhan this year is unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. In 1931, during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, Wuhan's dikes were breached when the water level was much lower than this year, and at that time, industrialists and businessmen and the people of the entire city did not know how many people went bankrupt and died. This year, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, we have successfully overcome the flood. We industrialists and businessmen were able to maintain daily operations even during the most intense period of flood control. This is a miracle to us. Such specific facts have had a profound educational impact on Wuhan industrialists and businessmen. However, it is undeniable that due to the limitations of our class nature, our general progress is still far behind the national situation. For example, although we have all undergone a series of studies on the general line of the transitional period and the constitution, there are still many industrialists and businessmen who have concerns in their minds, and even in their actions, there are illegal behaviors such as withdrawing funds and running down enterprises. This situation is sufficient to seriously affect the unity of the people of the entire country and cause significant losses. Therefore, patriotic industrialists and businessmen must strictly examine their own shortcomings, criticize their various incorrect thoughts and erroneous behaviors, and mutually supervise and help each other to further transform our enterprises and ourselves, and advance with the people of the entire country.

U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang traitor group will certainly not be willing to accept their shameful defeat and will not want our country to become more prosperous and powerful. Now, after a series of failures in its aggressive plots, the U.S. imperialist warmongers, while signing the so-called Paris Agreement and preparing to arm West Germany, have signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Kuomintang traitor group in the Far East, attempting to interfere with our country's liberation of its sacred territory of Taiwan, interfere with our internal affairs, and threaten our security and peace in Asia. We have once again recognized the ferocious face and evil plots of U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang traitor group. This plot has aroused the greatest indignation of the people of the entire country. We will not tolerate the aggressive behavior of U.S. imperialism, and we will definitely liberate Taiwan. Our cause is just, and a just cause will definitely achieve victory. We must educate and unite all industrialists and businessmen with the people of the entire country, enhance the belief in victory, and contribute our greatest strength to the sacred cause of liberating Taiwan and defending the motherland.

Over the past five years, many advanced and active elements have emerged among us industrialists and businessmen. They have approached the Communist Party and the people's government, set an example, promoted broad industrialists and businessmen to love the country and abide by the law, improved management, accepted socialist transformation, and have already played a considerable role. However, the work of many advanced elements in the industrial and commercial circles is not without flaws. With the rapid development of the country, the progress of many advanced elements often lags behind the requirements of the situation, and they cannot lead the broad industrialists and businessmen to advance together. This is my own experience and feeling in my work. Therefore, I believe that under the current situation, for the socialist transformation, for the victory of the struggle against domestic and foreign reactionary enemies, we industrialists and businessmen, especially those of us who are responsible for leading the work of industrial and commercial organizations, must first improve our ideological understanding and further clarify the boundaries between us and the enemy. Only in this way can we help the people of the entire country to further unite and strive for our common cause to achieve victory after victory.

Peng Zhen, a member of the committee, delivered a speech.

Chairman, fellow committee members:

After the National People's Congress formulated the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the first plenary session of the second national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is now being held. This is a matter of great historical significance. This conference will be conducive to strengthening the unity of various ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democrats, and strengthening the high degree of spiritual and political unity of the people of the entire country; it will be conducive to further organizing and mobilizing all members of the people's democratic united front to actively participate in socialist construction and socialist transformation; it will be conducive to promoting the people of the entire country to defend peace and oppose aggression, especially to promote the people of the entire country to liberate Taiwan and completely eliminate the Kuomintang traitor group's solemn struggle.

Title: Speeches at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

The speeches were made at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which was held from June 15 to June 20, 1955. The conference was attended by 1,244 representatives from various political parties, mass organizations, and ethnic groups.

Cheng Yifei, a delegate, spoke first. He said that he fully agreed with and enthusiastically supported the political report delivered by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, the work report delivered by Vice Chairman Chen Chutong, and the explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference by Commissioner Zhang Boqun. He also agreed with the decisions made by the conference regarding the aforementioned reports and the adoption of the constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a guideline for political life and practical work for units and individuals participating in the National Committee and local committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Cheng Yifei emphasized that over the past five years, the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the provincial and municipal consultative committees, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, had followed the provisions of the Common Program and played an important role in various social reforms, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, assisting the government in mobilizing the people to participate in political, economic, and cultural construction, strengthening and expanding the united front, and carrying out ideological transformation work. He believed that the assessment and summary of the work report were appropriate and in line with historical facts.

He noted that the National People's Congress, as the highest organ of state power, had convened, and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China had been formulated and promulgated. The functions originally performed by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference as a substitute for the National People's Congress were no longer necessary. The Common Program, which had served as a provisional constitution, had been replaced by the Constitution. However, due to the broad foundation of the people's democratic united front in the transitional period, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as an organizational form of the people's democratic united front, needed to continue to exist. Its tasks included: on the basis of strengthening the leadership of the working class and consolidating the alliance between workers and peasants, uniting all possible forces under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, struggling to build our country into a great socialist state, fighting against all enemies who attempt to sabotage our country, and fighting to defend world peace and promote the progress of humanity.

Cheng Yifei pointed out that the tasks outlined above clearly showed that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, bore a very heavy responsibility in consolidating and strengthening the unity of the people's democratic united front. This unity of all ethnic groups in the country, led by the Communist Party, was of decisive significance to the development and destiny of our country. Chairman Liu Shaoqi, in his report on the draft constitution of the People's Republic of China, stated: "On the premise of continuing to consolidate the leadership of the working class and the alliance between workers and peasants, the broader the unity among the people within the possible range, the better it is for the socialist cause." Every unit and individual participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should have a sufficient understanding of the importance of consolidating and strengthening unity. This unity must be and can only be a revolutionary unity based on a common struggle goal and a unified political foundation, specifically, a principled unity in the actual struggle to support and implement the Constitution. Therefore, any speech or action that violates the spirit of the Constitution will, in essence, weaken and harm unity.

Cheng Yifei believed that the general provisions of the constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the work report's proposal for future tasks were fully in line with the spirit of the Constitution. Our unshakable duty was to: strictly adhere to the principles of the general provisions and implement the glorious tasks ahead.

Cheng Yifei also mentioned that our country was about to enter the third year of planned economic construction. Everyone knew that we had no intention of invading others; we only needed and strove for a stable international environment and creative peaceful labor. However, the aggressive U.S. imperialists still occupied Taiwan, supported the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique in continuing their evil deeds in Taiwan, and constantly carried out destructive and provocative wars against our country, always attempting to return to the mainland. Recently, the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek had signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty," which aimed to escalate international tensions and provoke aggressive wars. This "treaty" was, on the one hand, a treasonous document signed by the Chiang clique, and on the other hand, a shameless confession by U.S. imperialism to further invade and provoke our country. The U.S. invaders occupied our territory, violated our sovereignty, interfered in our internal affairs, attempted to launch aggressive wars, and endangered peace in East Asia and the world. All of these were intolerable to our people. Various democratic parties and people's organizations in our country had already issued a joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan, and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai had also made a statement on the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The political report once again firmly stated our unyielding attitude. Cheng Yifei expressed his unconditional support. We were ardent lovers of peace but also resolute fighters against invaders. If the "Sino-American Treaty" signed by Chiang Kai-shek on the eve of his downfall could not reverse his fate of being driven out of the mainland, then at this time, when the Chinese people had achieved outstanding victories in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and our country's strength was growing, a piece of paper called the "Mutual Defense Treaty" and a Taiwan Strait could not stop the great power of the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and completing the cause of liberation. The U.S. invaders were now racking their brains to politically blackmail and slander our country, shouting and threatening us with war. However, this would not shake the iron will of our people to defend peace, resist aggression, and not rest until Taiwan is liberated. This would inevitably meet with our just resistance and counterattack. Our people must strengthen their work and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan from all aspects. Our cause is just, and a just cause can unite the people like a rock. The mighty power generated by this unity would definitely liberate Taiwan and sweep away the political garbage of the Chiang clique with the iron broom of the people.

Cheng Yifei concluded by saying, "Long live the great unity of the Chinese people's revolution!"

Chen Tie, a delegate, also spoke. He sincerely supported Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and fully agreed with the work report of the First National Committee and the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He promised to faithfully abide by and implement the seven common principles in the general provisions of the constitution.

Chen Tie said that our country was in a new stage of victorious development. The First National People's Congress had been held, and the second-year construction plan of the First Five-Year Plan had been successfully completed and even exceeded. The convening of this conference was at such an important historical juncture. As an organization of the people's democratic united front that unites all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and all patriotic democrats, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference would continue to play an important role in the socialist construction of our country. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we were full of confidence as we marched towards a brilliant future.

Chen Tie pointed out that U.S. imperialism was the most vicious enemy attempting to sabotage our country. It was unwilling to accept its defeat on the mainland and directed the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique to occupy Taiwan and harass the mainland. Recently, it had even signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty." The treasonous crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in selling out the country's territory and sovereignty were deeply hated; the evil deeds of U.S. imperialism in occupying our territory, violating our sovereignty, interfering in our internal affairs, and threatening our peaceful construction were even more infuriating! Taiwan was part of China, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. U.S. imperialism attempted to use war provocations to obstruct our just actions to liberate Taiwan and would inevitably suffer a humiliating defeat.

Chen Tie shared his personal experience of being deceived and serving the reactionary forces of Chiang Kai-shek. After realizing the truth and distinguishing right from wrong, he resolutely left the Chiang clique and joined the people. Over the years, the Party and the government had kindly cared for him, enabling him to receive profound patriotic education and truly serve the people. Now, with the signing of the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" by the U.S. and Chiang, the treasonous crimes of the Chiang clique were even more shameless. Therefore, he hoped that his former classmates, colleagues, and friends who were still deceived and coerced by the Chiang clique in Taiwan would wake up and repent, make amends for their mistakes, and would definitely be treated leniently by the people.

Chen Tie concluded by saying that he would definitely strengthen his studies, work hard, and contribute his strength to the great cause of building the motherland and defending peace, forever following the great Communist Party of China!

Jiang Lifu, a delegate, spoke as a higher education worker. He was very excited to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Although he was not one to speak much, he wanted to share some of his thoughts after liberation to express his excitement.

Jiang Lifu had been engaged in higher education for thirty-five years. Forty years ago, when he studied mathematics abroad, he had dreamed of cultivating talents and doing some pioneering work in mathematics after returning to China. However, after returning, the department he taught had only one student. Before liberation, students did not want to enter the mathematics department because mathematics graduates usually became middle school teachers, who were not respected or valued at that time. Therefore, his department always had only three or five students per class. His dreams could not be realized. After liberation, the situation changed completely in just a few years. Now, the mathematics department of Sun Yat-sen University had more than 250 students, with 120 in the third year and more than 80 in his classes. The contrast between one and eighty showed the vast difference between old China and new China in their attitudes towards culture, science, and talent cultivation. Now, not only did most students love their majors and study hard, but teachers could also fully utilize their strengths and devote themselves to teaching and scientific research, even feeling that their abilities could not keep up with the development of teaching work. The reality before his eyes surpassed his lifelong dreams. If it were not for the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the establishment of the People's Republic of China, how could such a great and profound change occur! From this, he realized that only when the people held power today could a good environment be created for scientific workers, enabling higher education to develop limitlessly.

However, this realization was not easily gained. In the past, he had taken detours and made mistakes. He wanted to talk about two painful incidents in his life.

Everyone knew that reference materials were very important for scientific research. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, he taught at Nankai University, where the school had limited funds. He spent twenty years collecting many mathematics reference books. After the July 7th Incident, he spent a lot of effort preparing to transport these books to Yunnan. However, just as they arrived in Haiphong, the invading Japanese army entered Vietnam, and most of the books were lost.

Another more painful incident occurred after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. He had helped the puppet Central Research Institute prepare a mathematics research institute, purchasing many mathematics books from abroad. In late 1948, just as they arrived in Nanjing, the People's Liberation Army was preparing to cross the Yangtze River, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was about to collapse. He, not understanding the policies of the People's Liberation Army, thought that chaos would ensue and that the books he had worked hard to find would be lost, and that a quiet environment for studying would be destroyed. Due to his attachment to these books and his desire to find a quiet place for research, he mistakenly fled to Taiwan. Half a year later, he realized that the environment there was very bad and that scientific research work was out of the question. Only then did he try every means to return to Guangzhou. He had always thought that he only taught books and did not involve politics, but he had made mistakes in this regard.

This experience taught him that scientific workers could not be separated from politics; the actual situation of the past few years also told him that only by following the Communist Party and wholeheartedly serving the people could he fully utilize his talents. In the future, he would seriously study Marxism-Leninism, learn from the advanced teaching experience of the Soviet Union, participate in academic research work, and follow the people forever. He remembered the ancient saying: "Learning is like rowing upstream; if you do not advance, you will fall back." Political learning and ideological transformation were the same. If one did not advance with socialism, old diseases would recur, and old mistakes would be repeated. This was his thought on ideological transformation, and he hoped that everyone would correct him.

Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, a delegate, spoke. He first congratulated the convening of the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He said that the First Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, held in September 1949, had exercised the functions of the National People's Congress, formulated the Common Program, and established the Central People's Government. Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people had achieved great successes on various fronts according to the Common Program and had prepared good conditions for the convening of the First National People's Congress in 1955.

The Dalai Lama mentioned that, just as great achievements had been made on other fronts, great achievements had also been made in ethnic work: strengthening unity among ethnic groups, consolidating national unity, and making the great People's Republic of China a big family of ethnic groups united, friendly, mutually supportive, and cooperative.

Taking Tibet as an example, the Dalai Lama said that Tibet was the last region on the mainland to be liberated and had suffered deeply from imperialist aggression. However, due to the correct ethnic policies stipulated in the Common Program, Tibet was peacefully liberated in 1951, freed from imperialist shackles, and returned to the big family of the motherland. The correct implementation of ethnic policies by the People's Liberation Army and the working personnel who entered Tibet had made Tibetan people increasingly feel the warmth of the big family of the motherland and see their bright future, thus increasing their patriotic spirit and wholeheartedly supporting national unity.

However, the Dalai Lama pointed out that we could not be complacent with these achievements. The Chiang Kai-shek clique still occupied Taiwan, and U.S. imperialism did not want to see our country becoming more prosperous and strong. They were trying every means to surround and invade us. We must always be vigilant and further strengthen the unity among ethnic groups in our country and consolidate national unity. If imperialism dared to invade us, we would smash it with the iron fist of united ethnic groups.

The Dalai Lama emphasized that our purpose of unity was not for war but for peace. We urgently needed a peaceful environment to build our motherland, so that the economic and cultural lives of all ethnic groups in our country could be continuously improved. However, U.S. imperialism was trying to support the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique to occupy Taiwan and turn it into a military base to disrupt our peaceful construction. The recently signed U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" was a concrete manifestation of its aggressive policy. We opposed this aggressive behavior because as long as Taiwan was not liberated, our peaceful construction would always be threatened by the U.S. war. At the same time, Taiwan was an inseparable part of our territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. The Tibetan people not only firmly supported this determination but would also provide full support.

Shi Jinmo, a delegate, spoke. He was a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Beijing for over forty years. Although he had treated many patients, he still felt that he had not established a closer connection with the masses and that his spirit of serving the people was far from sufficient. Why was this the case? Because everyone knew that under the reactionary rule, whether traditional or Western medicine, there was no political status. At that time, the reactionary government had never valued the medical heritage of the motherland; to be more precise, it had let it die out naturally. Under such circumstances, it was impossible to talk about fully utilizing the strength of each individual. Now, however, things were completely different. He was able to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which made him feel extremely honored. However, this honor was not for him personally but for all traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in new China. This showed that in the new society led by the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the political status of traditional Chinese medicine had been elevated.

After liberation, under the government's policy of valuing the medical heritage of the motherland, traditional Chinese medicine had received guidance, connection, and organization, enabling traditional Chinese medicine practitioners across the country to have more opportunities to take the initiative and be proactive. Especially after hearing Chairman Mao's great call for traditional Chinese medicine work this year, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were all moved. Currently, many hospitals have set up traditional Chinese medicine outpatient departments. He personally participated in the work of the traditional Chinese medicine departments of the Peking Union Medical College and Beijing Hospital. In various places across the country, many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners had voluntarily disclosed their ancestral secret prescriptions. This action showed that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in new China, encouraged and helped by the government, had realized that they were the masters of the country and that their skills should be fully contributed to the country and the people. The political and technical level of traditional Chinese medicine had improved, and traditional Chinese medicine would definitely redouble its efforts, master scientific knowledge, and better contribute its skills to the country and the people. As for how traditional and Western medicine should exchange knowledge, observe academic exchanges, how traditional Chinese medicine books should be organized and re-edited, how traditional Chinese medicine education should be improved, and how traditional Chinese medicine should be reformed and promoted, he had previously submitted opinions to relevant departments. Now, due to time constraints, he would not elaborate further.

At the same time, after many facts of education after liberation, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners felt that they had greater development opportunities in politics and technology, and their love for the new society had increased day by day. Precisely because of this, they could not help but think of the compatriots in Taiwan who were still suffering in deep water and fire, with the bloody rule of the Chiang clique still weighing on their shoulders. Therefore, the current greatest task of the Chinese people was to liberate Taiwan.

Recently, U.S. imperialism had signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, attempting to long-term occupy our sacred territory. The Chinese people were extremely indignant at this hostile and aggressive act against the People's Republic of China. Taiwan was part of China, and it was only natural for the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. We must liberate Taiwan, and any attempt to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan would definitely be smashed!

Tang Shengzhi, a delegate, spoke. He fully agreed with Vice Chairman Chen Chutong's work report and Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and agreed with the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He was willing to abide by the constitution and strive for the new tasks it outlined.

Tang Shengzhi said that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was the organizational form of the Chinese people's democratic united front and the most important concrete way for the people of the whole country to achieve revolutionary unity. Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the firm unity and common struggle of all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and all patriotic democrats had successfully implemented the Common Program. The First Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and its National Committee had gloriously completed their historical mission. Now, the First Session of the First National People's Congress had been successfully held; we had written the achievements of the past five years and the current work into the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. The basic content of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference had also been included in the Constitution. The task of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to exercise the functions of the National People's Congress had ended. However, in the future, to mobilize and unite the people of the whole country to complete the general tasks of the transitional period and fight against domestic and foreign enemies, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as an organizational form of the people's democratic united front, would continue to play its role in the political life of the country. Because "the revolutionary unity of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the working class is not only necessary for our people's democratic revolution but also necessary for the realization of the socialist cause." As Chairman Liu Shaoqi had said: "Because imperialism still stands before us. At the same time, the choice of paths for our people is actually only two: either to be re-enslaved by imperialism or to realize socialism. China wants to be independent, democratic, and prosperous and can only take the path of socialism. Under these circumstances, all those who do not want to be colonial slaves will have the possibility of uniting under the leadership of the working class to accept the path of socialism. On the premise of continuing to consolidate the leadership of the working class and the alliance between workers and peasants, the broader the unity among the people within the possible range, the better it is for the socialist cause. Therefore, our constitution should be a constitution of the great unity of the people of the whole country to build a socialist society." The main task of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in the future was to unite all possible forces at home and abroad, fully implement the Constitution, and struggle to build our country into a socialist state.

Tang Shengzhi pointed out that the foundation of our unity was very solid, and the scale of our unity was very broad, unprecedented in history. Our unity was established on the Common Program in the past and is now established on the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Although imperialism and reactionaries were still trying every means to sabotage this unity, we believed that there was no force in the world that could obstruct and sabotage the revolutionary unity of the Chinese people. As Chairman Mao had said in his opening speech at the preparatory meeting of the New Political Consultative Conference: "This united front is so solid that it has the strong will and inexhaustible ability to overcome any enemy and any difficulty."

To develop and consolidate our unity, we should, through various democratic parties, people's organizations, and people's consultative bodies, continue to promote and guide the self-education and self-transformation movements of all sectors of the people, strengthen the leadership of all sectors of the people to learn Marxism-Leninism, and learn to use the methods of criticism and self-criticism. This was the method indicated by Chairman Mao for "promoting everyone to insist on truth and correct mistakes." To develop and consolidate our unity, we should advocate and carry forward the democratic style, be good at consulting with people, be good at consulting with those who have different opinions, repeatedly consult, and gather wisdom. This was beneficial to work. To develop and consolidate our unity, the units and individuals participating in the united front should distinguish between enemies and friends, and between right and wrong, and everyone should concentrate their energy on work and things beneficial to the people. We should, in the spirit of sincerity, frankness, seeking truth from facts, speaking without reservation, and exhaustive expression, have suggestions, criticisms, and self-criticisms, and help each other to progress. We should progress ourselves and also help others to progress, and become sincere friends, frank friends, and beneficial friends to each other.

Tang Shengzhi said that we were advancing. We were doing something extremely glorious and great that our ancestors had never done. We were "busy," from the district and township levels to the central level, everyone was busy, because we had to race against time and had to be busy. Being busy was not a problem, but we hoped that everyone could further do a good job of being busy but not chaotic, reducing some unnecessary busyness, being busy with the greatest results, and most importantly, being busy without damaging health. This required everyone to be more strict and planned in doing things, doing things according to the plan.

Tang Shengzhi pointed out that our enemies were not reconciled to our victory and construction. Recently, U.S. imperialism had the audacity to sign the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, which was a thorough and through aggressive war treaty. We would not allow history to repeat itself. We must further strengthen our unity and work in all aspects to fully support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and we would not rest until our goal was achieved.

Chairman Mao had instructed us: "Our cause is just. A just cause is invincible to any enemy." Premier Zhou Enlai had also instructed us: "Our socialist construction and socialist transformation are just, and our cause of liberating Taiwan, defending our sovereignty and territorial integrity, and defending peace in East Asia and the world is also just." "Our just cause not only can unite the people of the whole country but also can obtain the support of all international friends." "We can unite the people of the whole country, and we can also unite with all international friends. This is the basic guarantee for us to build a socialist society."

Let us unite more firmly, under the leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China and our great teacher and leader Chairman Mao, and fight to the end for our common just cause.

Chu Tu'nan, a delegate, spoke. He expressed his heartfelt support for Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and fully agreed with Vice Chairman Chen Chutong's work report and Commissioner Zhang Boqun's explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Chu Tu'nan pointed out that in Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, it was emphasized that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference needed to continue to play its role and strengthen its work in the future, and one of the important tasks was to promote the people of the whole country to strengthen the defense of world peace, promote international cooperation, and peaceful coexistence. This was fully in line with the spirit of the preamble of our country's Constitution, which stipulated that "in international affairs, our country's unshakable policy is to strive for the lofty goal of world peace and human progress." This reflected the great and strong will of all the people of China and was also in line with the common interests and demands of the people of all countries. This was because, after experiencing two world wars in the twentieth century, the people of various countries generally had a deep understanding that war only brought terror and disasters to the people, irreparable misfortunes and losses, while peace could promote the prosperity and progress of humanity, enable the people of various countries to understand each other, cooperate with each other, and conduct economic trade and cultural exchanges, thereby promoting humanity to a future of civilization, progress, and happiness.

However, this peace must be established on the basis of the five principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, in order to be a solid and lasting peace. Facts had proven that people of different social systems and political beliefs could coexist peacefully. For example, our country and the neighboring countries of India and Burma had established new peaceful and friendly relations based on the five principles through the talks between the two prime ministers. This relationship was established not only because of the long-standing cultural and friendly ties between the Chinese, Indian, and Burmese peoples but more importantly because the Chinese, Indian, and Burmese peoples today all needed a peaceful environment. For these countries' peoples, peaceful coexistence was no longer a matter of possibility but a necessity and desire in their real lives. Of course, this need and desire also existed in the real lives of the peoples of other Asian countries and the world, who also demanded peace. Therefore, the joint statement of the Chinese, Indian, and Burmese prime ministers and the establishment of the five principles had already received a warm response from the peoples of other Asian countries and the world. We believed that the peaceful regions of Asia would continue to expand, and the voices of the peoples of the world demanding peaceful coexistence would become even stronger and more powerful.

Facts had proven that promoting friendly relations among the peoples of various countries through trade exchanges and cultural exchanges was an effective way to achieve peaceful coexistence among the countries of the world. Human economic and cultural life was an indivisible whole, and no country could develop in isolation. Therefore, people, starting from their own lives, demanded mutual trade and cultural exchanges, and these activities made their material and spiritual connections closer, increased their mutual assistance, cooperation, sympathy, understanding, and sincere friendship, and could more effectively promote and advance the lasting peace and rapid progress of human culture in the world. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our people had been following the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, carrying forward the fine tradition of the Chinese people's love for peace, and resolutely pursuing a peaceful policy, conducting trade exchanges, cultural exchanges, and other friendly activities with the peoples of various countries. Over the past five years, these activities had been continuously developing. Through these activities, we not only learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries in economic and cultural construction but also helped to strengthen the solid unity of the entire peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp and the peaceful and friendly ties between the peoples of the world, thereby expanding and strengthening the peaceful forces of the world led by the Soviet Union. Just to take the recent facts, during this year's National Day, we invited cultural and friendly delegations from many countries in the East and West to visit and tour China. These delegations of friends, through their visits and contacts with various sectors, not only understood the peaceful nature of the construction of new China but also generally felt that the Chinese people were eager to conduct economic and cultural exchanges with the peoples of various countries and the importance of these exchanges to the material and cultural life of humanity and world peace, and also expressed the wish of the peoples of various countries to be friendly and cooperative with the Chinese people. For example, the British cultural and academic delegation this time brought a letter of greetings from more than 670 famous cultural figures in Britain to the Chinese cultural circle. The delegation leader, Professor Hawks, said when handing over this letter of greetings: "Just as we six people represent more than 600 people, we believe that these more than 600 people represent millions of other people, and these people, like us, are eager to make a real effort to expand the exchange of ideas, promote the flow of knowledge, and promote sympathy and understanding between our two countries." The delegation member, philosopher Professor Ayer, had given a lecture at Peking University and had a heated discussion with Chinese philosophers. Professor Ayer expressed before his departure and after his return to England that these discussions were pleasant because they showed that people of different beliefs could understand each other and be friends. We believed that the peoples and scholars of the world, just like the British people and Professor Ayer, generally hoped to be friendly and cooperative with the Chinese people, to be friends with the cultural circle of China, to realize a world of "better, more understanding, and peaceful happiness" as Mr. Hawks said. For this world, the Chinese people would continue to work hard to strengthen the work of developing friendly relations with the peoples of various countries and promoting cultural exchanges.

It must be pointed out that at a time when the peoples of the world demanded peaceful coexistence, some ruling cliques of certain countries were advocating a policy of force, implementing their conspiracy to launch and expand aggressive wars. Recently, U.S. imperialists had signed an agreement with the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique to expand aggression and prepare for a new war, known as the "Mutual Defense Treaty." This treaty was another link in the entire aggressive system of U.S. imperialism, which aimed to deepen the division of the world, enslave the peoples of the world, and prepare for a new world war after the Manila Pact and the Paris Agreement. The Chinese people were determined to defend the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the motherland and must liberate Taiwan and annihilate the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique. The peoples of Asia and the Pacific would definitely unite to smash the Manila Pact and other war treaties of U.S. imperialism in Asia and the Pacific to defend their peaceful lives, just as the peoples of Europe would smash the Paris Agreement to save their nations from the Nazi iron hoof. Our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said in his statement on the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty": "The Chinese people fervently desire peace, but will not use their territory and sovereignty as a price to beg for peace. Sacrificing territory and sovereignty can only lead to further aggression and will not obtain true peace. The Chinese people understand that only by resisting aggression can peace be defended." These words fully expressed the attitude and determination of the Chinese people. The policy of force and aggressive war was absolutely incompatible with the five principles of peaceful coexistence. We believed that between the two, the peoples of the world would definitely make a wise choice and a brave struggle; strengthening trade exchanges, cultural exchanges, and friendly international activities would be an important way and a powerful means to promote and advance this work. Therefore, we must pay attention to this aspect in our thinking and work hard to do a good job in this aspect.

In summary, the Chinese people would follow the provisions of the Constitution and the work tasks pointed out by this conference, carry forward the spirit of high patriotism and internationalism, improve socialist political awareness, and build our prosperous and powerful motherland, defend the security of the motherland and the lasting peace of Asia and the world. For this sacred and lofty purpose and to complete this arduous and glorious task, we must continue to work hard, actively and positively, from various aspects and through various forms, to strengthen friendly ties and economic and cultural exchanges with the peoples of the world, further consolidate and expand the forces of peace, and thereby guarantee the victory of our great cause of peaceful construction and the beautiful future of human peace, happiness, and cultural progress.

Sheng Puhua, a delegate, spoke. He fully agreed with and supported Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice Chairman Chen Chutong's work report of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Commissioner Zhang Boqun's explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Sheng Puhua said that over the past five years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference had exercised the functions of the National People's Congress; mobilized and united the people of the whole country to resist U.S. imperialist aggression, defend national security, and defend international peace; assisted the government in mobilizing the people to carry out various revolutionary movements and construction work, and promoted and organized the ideological transformation of various sectors, playing an important role in consolidating and expanding the unity of the people of the whole country; thereby making the various construction work of the country proceed more smoothly. Today, the First Session of the First National People's Congress had been held, and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China had been promulgated. The task of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to exercise the functions of the National People's Congress had ended. However, to successfully complete the general tasks of the transitional period, it was even more necessary to unite and concentrate the strength of the people of the whole country. Therefore, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as an organizational form of the people's democratic united front, must further consolidate and develop in the national socialist construction and socialist transformation and the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, and continue to play its role.

Sheng Puhua pointed out that the work of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference had achievements. However, the work report also pointed out that the activities of understanding and reflecting the opinions of various sectors of the people and propagating and explaining various policies and current affairs were not frequent and broad enough. He believed that this was completely correct. This shortcoming, we who were responsible for work in the local areas should take more responsibility. He himself was responsible for work in Shanghai, which was a region where private industry and commerce were relatively concentrated. Shanghai was one of the key areas for the national socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Therefore, further widely and deeply propagating and explaining the general tasks of the transitional period and the relevant policies and laws of the state to the business community; at the same time, timely reflecting the problems arising from the transformation process to the relevant departments and, according to the needs of the situation, providing appropriate suggestions, would help to solve various problems in a timely manner, that is, to make the transformation work proceed smoothly, that is, to make the business community actively accept socialist transformation and the people of the whole country unite more closely. However, in this aspect of work, we had not done enough, especially for the more complex and extensive small and medium-sized industries, we had not done enough, which was something we needed to improve in our future work.

Sheng Puhua said that our country was carrying out socialist construction and socialist transformation. We needed peace, and the experience of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea had proven that we had the strength to defend peace. U.S. imperialism was unwilling to accept its past failures and had recently become even more crazy in creating international tensions, signing the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, attempting to long-term occupy Taiwan, which was something we would never tolerate. We would not be intimidated by the threats of U.S. imperialism. We must continue to strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression, liberate our sacred territory of Taiwan, defend national security, and defend world peace. The current situation required the people of the whole country to unite more closely and work harder. Especially in coastal areas like Shanghai, which were on the front line of the struggle against the enemy, we should be more vigilant and strictly prevent the sabotage, rumors, and incitement of bandits and special agents. We businesspeople, together with the people of the whole country, participated in this great and just anti-aggression struggle, which was glorious. We must all contribute our strength, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, further play the important role of the people's democratic united front, and with the actual actions of actively accepting socialist transformation and participating in socialist construction, support the struggle to liberate the motherland's territory of Taiwan and strive to build our country into a great socialist state!

    在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议上的发言
    董必武委员的发言主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    我对于周恩来副主席的政治报告和陈叔通副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会的工作报告，完全同意。我研究了中国人民政治协商会议章程草案，觉得很好。我们从这些报告和章程里可以明确地了解当前的国际、国内形势和今后的任务方针，并且有了章程，这就使得中国人民政治协商会议在它过去动员和团结全国人民进行国家各项伟大改革和建设事业的经验的基础上，今后继续动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期的总任务，将会更好地发挥它的作用。我相信这是可以预期的。
    过去，我们的人民政治协商会议，通过了临时宪法性的共同纲领，代行了人民代表大会的职权，产生了中央人民政府，成立了中华人民共和国；同时选举出它的全国委员会来执行它所负担的政治任务。五年多来，全国人民在中国工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党的领导下，取得了解放战争的彻底胜利，肃清了大陆上的蒋介石残余匪帮，随着一个胜利接一个胜利地进行了土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、“三反”、“五反”、恢复国民经济等伟大运动，自一九五三年起，我们已进入了有计划的大规模的社会主义经济建设。从而，我国的国际地位和全国人民的觉悟程度与组织程度空前提高，人民生活也已有了显著的改善，使得工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权更加巩固。所有这些伟大成就，是同中国人民政治协商会议的努力分不开的。特别应当指出的，我们人民政治协商会议的每一组织成员，经过了这五年多来各项伟大运动的锻炼和考验，经过了这五年来有计划有组织地学习马克思列宁主义和进行思想改造，大家的觉悟水平更加提高了，政治认识更趋一致了，因而我们的人民民主统一战线更加巩固了。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第二次会议闭幕词中指示我们的过三“关”，今天说来，第一、第二两“关”已经过去了，而且过得很好；第三“关”已开始过了，我相信我们在中国共产党领导下，克服困难，一定会过去的。
    现在当我们正在过第三“关”的时候，大家来回忆一下过去那些“关”是怎样过去的，我想不是没有意义的。大家还记得，当着革命的人民英勇地进行解放战争，并且将要取得全国胜利的时候，帝国主义者造谣，说我们不能取得全国胜利，纵然胜利也不能巩固。帝国主义者的这一造谣在现实面前是完全破产了；可是当时我们大家的思想是怎样的呢？是否当时所有的人对于中国人民取得战争的胜利并巩固这一胜利都有坚定的信心呢？毛主席在
  “论人民民主专政”中，总结了中国人民革命的经验，除了关于民主专政问题给了我们明确指示外，并且指出我们要达到胜利和巩固胜利，必须一边倒。就是倒向社会主义一边，反对倒向帝国主义一边的蒋介石反动派，反对第三条路线的幻想。事实上我们大家是这样作了，我们同苏联、各人民民主国家和其他各国广大人民已结成了强大的和平民主阵线，并且因之改变了世界的面貌。如果我们大家从思想上来看，是否当时所有的人对于必须倒向社会主义一边都有明确的认识呢？对于第三条道路完全没有幻想呢？当美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争，打到鸭绿江边，企图把战争火焰烧进我们国境，并且侵占了我国领土台湾的时候，我们根据全国人民的要求，发布了“各民主党派联合宣言”，发动了伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国的正义斗争。依靠中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军英勇奋发，敌忾同仇，很快就把美帝国主义纸老虎戳穿，把它的侵略军赶回到三八线，终于使朝鲜停战胜利实现。如果我们大家从思想上来看，当时，所有的人，对美帝国主义的凶恶面目是否都有清晰的认识呢？对美帝国主义的纸老虎架势是否都有真正的认识呢？所有这些问题，我想可能在某些人的思想中存在过某种程度的动摇，是合乎实际情况的。经过人民解放战争和人民民主革命运动，特别是以后的抗美援朝运动，经过揭发美帝国主义一贯侵略我国和敌视我国人民的阴谋事实，由于受到了深刻的爱国主义和国际主义的教育，使原来在思想上敌我界线不清的一些人也逐步认清了美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌，并且懂得了“一边倒”的道理。古话说得好，“前事不忘，后事之师”。我们能由这些事实中吸取经验教训，将是获益不少的。
    我们再回想一下土地改革时的思想情况吧。大家知道，土地改革是废除地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制，实行农民的土地所有制，借以解放农村生产力，发展农业生产，为我国的工业化开辟道路。这是中国人民翻天覆地的伟大的革命斗争。我们大家都参加或参观了土地改革运动，在这样一个伟大运动中，我们体会到为了群众、依靠群众、走群众路线的真理，因而改进了为人民服务的态度，也认识了革命实践是改造思想、端正立场最有效的方法。但是在我国要进行土地改革的初期，曾有这样一种说法：“中国没有什么很大的地主。”这就是说中国没有土地问题。土改运动开始，又有人担心这里“过火”，那里“过左”。当时有人想政府出张布告、要地主把土地拿出来，不必要农民自己动手。这是幻想不经过发动群众进行斗争，就可以和和平平地消灭几千年来的封建剥削制度。这类思想没有为大家所接受。在今天来说，土地改革依靠发动农民群众，在全国范围内早已胜利完成了；由于土地改革运动的胜利，生产力显著提高，农业生产互助合作运动蓬勃发展，农村进一步民主化，工农联盟更加巩固了。这是有目共睹的事实。在事实面前，我们大家回忆一下当时的思想动态和它的发展过程，对于我们大家过第三“关”时是有帮助的。
    现在我们正在过第三“关”。毛主席曾经鼓励大家：“只要战争关、土改关都过去了，剩下的一关就将容易过去的”。大家如果深刻体会到“两个性质不同的革命过程，只有完成了前一个革命过程才有可能去完成后一个革命过程。民主主义革命是社会主义革命的必要准备，社会主义革命是民主主义革命的必然趋势。”那么我们在思想改造的已有经验的基础之上，经过和平转变的道路达到幸福的社会主义社会，应该说这是大家容易过得去的。但我们必须正视社会主义改造，这就是要以适合我国国民经济发展情况的方式逐步消灭剥削制度，这便不是一件轻而易举的事情。我国宪法规定，“国家对资本主义工商业采取利用、限制和改造的政策”，这是大家公认的正确政策，但也有人认为：“利用太不好听，限制太不自由，改造太不光荣”。又宪法规定国家“以发展生产合作为改造个体农业和个体手工业的主要道路”。国民经济中个体经济经过互助合作达到集体化，这是个体劳动者摆脱贫困的必经的道路。但是广大的个体农民和个体手工业者习惯于小生产，习惯于走旧路，完全认识到集体生产的优越性，还需要经过相当长时期的艰苦工作，用通俗的理论和生动的事实去说服他们，使他们相信。还有我国第一个五年计划的基本任务是集中主要力量发展重工业。但是有人想首先发展轻工业是否更好些；或者有人想现时国家发展重工业，让私人搞轻工业。这说明在这些基本问题上的想法，我们大家并不是开始就完全一致的。经过政协这个组织帮助我们大家学习、研究，我们开始对某一问题思想不一致，逐渐就有可能趋于一致了。这就是说，过第三“关”，还是要我们大家努力的。我们大家在政协全国委员会领导下经过了关于总路线和宪法的学习，特别是社会主义改造有两年的实践，对于建设社会主义社会问题的认识，已经有了进一步的提高。
  一切经验证明，政治思想上的一致是巩固我们团结的基础。我们大家为了求得政治思想上的一致，必须深入群众，在实践中提高自己；必须在过去以共同纲领、在今后以宪法为标准，采用批评和自我批评的方法，坚持真理，修改错误，认真地进行自我教育和自我改造的工作。这些在章程的总纲中都有规定，我们大家在通过了章程后必能遵守它。
    由于宪法的公布，建成幸福繁荣的社会主义社会，已成为全国人民共同的目标。因此，社会主义改造这一“关”，我们大家正在过而且还没有过完，前途的光明是毫无疑义的。当然在我们前进的道路上还会有许多困难，特别是美帝国主义及其帮凶们必然千方百计地阻挠和破坏我们正在进行的伟大的社会主义建设事业，美蒋条约的签订，即是企图妨害我们在完整的领土上建设社会主义的一个极明显的事例。但是台湾是中国领土，必须解放；一切困难吓不住我们的，我们必须前进。我希望我们大家在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，依据即将通过的中国人民政治协商会议章程，坚定信心，克服困难，继续努力进行思想改造，加强团结，为贯彻宪法、完成国家过渡时期总任务而奋斗。
    李济深副主席的发言主席、各位委员：
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议，在毛主席亲自主持下隆重开幕了。我们听了周副主席的政治报告和第一届全国委员会的工作报告，以及关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明，我代表中国国民党革命委员会，表示完全同意和拥护。关于章程草案和总纲中的七项共同准则，我们一定坚决遵守，积极执行。
      五年多来，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下广泛地团结了各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和各方面爱国民主人士，在动员人民协助政府完成各项任务中，做了很多的工作，起了重要的作用。我们这一届全国委员会全体会议的举行，是标志着全国各民族、各阶级人民的团结更加扩大，力量更加集中，也标志着广泛的人民民主统一战线得到更进一步的巩固和发展。
    中华人民共和国宪法序言指出：“今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线将继续发挥它的作用。”现在我们的任务是更进一步动员和团结全国人民，协助政府，贯彻宪法的实施，为建成伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗，为保卫祖国领土主权的完整，反对侵略战争，争取亚洲和世界的和平而奋斗。
    美帝国主义不甘心于在中国大陆上的失败，一贯与中国人民为敌，豢养蒋介石卖国集团盘踞台湾，侵扰我国大陆。最近，更变本加厉，签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，明目张胆地霸占我国领土，侵犯我国主权，干涉我国内政，向中国人民挑战。
    中国人民热爱和平，但决不能容忍侵略；中国人民反对战争，但决不怕武力威胁。我们对于美帝国主义的严重罪行表示极大的愤怒。我们一定要击退美帝国主义的战争挑衅，我们也坚决反对所谓台湾“独立”、台湾“中立化”和“托管”台湾等迎合美国侵略政策的荒谬主张。要保持亚洲和世界的和平，必须使美国撤退它在台湾及台湾海峡的一切武装力量。任何外国敢于阻挠干涉中国人民解放台湾都将受到应得的惩罚！中国人民有充分的信心，胜利地完成解放台湾、保卫和平的任务。我们应当加强团结，加强工作，发挥力量，为解放台湾消灭蒋介石卖国集团而斗争到底！
    中国国民党革命委员会，是参加中国人民政治协商会议的一个单位，五年多来，在中国共产党领导下同各民主党派一起，团结自己的成员和所联系的群众，在贯彻国家政策法令、参加各项运动、做好岗位工作、进行思想改造等方面，做了一些工作。我们在参加革命斗争的实践中，越来越深刻地体会到，要能够经常遵循正确的方向，克服困难，求得进步，做好工作，完成任务，就只有坚定我们以工人阶级为领导的思想，切实接受中国共产党的领导。
    中国人民的革命事业是光荣的，同时也是艰巨的。我相信，加强中国共产党在统一战线中的领导作用，必然是我们所有参加这次会议的各单位和各个人大家共同的愿望。我们要更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，在伟大领袖毛泽东的光辉旗帜下前进！
    我们解放台湾的斗争一定胜利！
    我们建设社会主义社会的伟大事业一定成功！
    黄炎培委员的发言主席、诸位委员、诸位同志！
    我代表中国民主建国会完全拥护周恩来副主席的报告。
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议是在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议甫经通过中华人民共和国宪法，向全国人民公布之后召开的，它是有特定的历史任务的。中国人民政治协商会议是我国人民民主统一战线的组织形式。宪法序言明白地写着：“今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线将继续发挥它的作用”。那么，人民政协今后应该怎样依照着这条轨道更加努力呢？
    今后必须——
      （一）更加扩大团结全国人民的力量。
    毛主席在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议开幕辞中间说：“全中国六万万人团结起来，为我们的共同事业而努力奋斗！”为了争取反对内外敌人的斗争胜利，必须团结全国人民；为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家，为了保卫祖国、保卫国际和平和发展人类进步事业，必须团结全国人民。
    （二）更广泛地反映人民群众的意见。
    宪法第十七条“一切国家机关必须依靠人民群众，经常保持同群众的密切联系，倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督。”人民政协全国委员会委员从人民群众中来，我们所依靠的是人民群众，监督我们的是人民群众，我们一面倾听人民群众的意见，一面当然要反映给有关各方，反映得越正确、越普遍，就是我们对国家、对人民的贡献越大。
    把人民群众的意见，尽量反映给国家机关，使国家机关受到人民群众的监督，这样，人民群众定将完全贡献出他们的力量，这就是加强了人民群众的团结工作。
    我们来到中央了。政府说：你们不是从人民群众中来么？人民群众有意见，还有种种情况托你们带来，你们带来了没有？到我们回去的时候，老百姓说：你们不是从中央来么？中央有许多政策、法令，还有种种措施，要我们老百姓知道，我们老百姓也正要知道，你们带来了没有？也只有做到尽量地充分地反映人民群众的意见，才会使人民群众感觉到政府对我们老百姓多么温暖！国家对我们老百姓多么亲切！政府是我们人民的政府，国家是我们人民的国家，我们是一家人，这样，政府和人民间、人民和人民间，一定会更加紧密起来！
    作为人民政协全国委员会委员，我们的嘴巴应该是扩音器，我们的职务也就是通讯员。对么？对。但还是不够。我们自己脑海里所有感想，所有意见，也必须倾筐倒箧地贡献出来，总要做到知无不言，言无不尽。领导上正在期望我们，要求我们这样做，可能老百姓还在埋怨我们为什么不这样做，我们的“头脑箱”不要封锁起来，自以为谨慎、老练呢！
    必须认定：人民政协过去已经这样做了。全国上下彼此之间，已经更开诚地对待了。今后大家要做得更尽量、更充分，每一个人全心全力地为社会主义建设事业尽一分责任。
    我是代表中国民主建国会来参加的。从中国民主建国会来说，它的主要使命是：
    一、在中国共产党领导下，团结、教育中国民族资产阶级，在国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造中，结合企业改造进行个人改造，并代表他们的合法利益；
    二、密切联系民族资产阶级，了解、研究、反映他们的意见和要求，推动他们接受社会主义改造，反对危害公共利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划的一切非法行为；
    三、协助政府宣传、推行国家的政策法令。
    这些都是中国民主建国会特定的主要任务。为了改造和发展国民经济，来建设社会主义社会的新中国，就中国民主建国会说来，必须完成这特定的任务；最近政府发行一九五五年国家经济建设公债，为了加速国家经济建设，提高我们爱国主义思想水平，就中国民主建国会说来，必须完成这特定的任务；更重大的，为了团结全国人民，发挥六万万人不可抗的力量，来解放我国领土台湾，就中国民主建国会说来，也必须完成这特定的任务。
    我们必须为了完成特定的任务而努力！我们必须为了发展共同事业而共同努力！
    李四光委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    首先，请允许我代表全国科学工作者对陈叔通副主席昨天在大会上所作的工作报告和由章伯钧委员加以说明的中国人民政治协商会议章程草案表示赞同，对周恩来副主席政治报告表示衷心拥护，对我国五年多以来在中国共产党和中央人民政府正确领导下获得的伟大成就表示欢欣鼓舞和敬意。
    五年多以来，在中国共产党和政府的领导下，在毛主席的关怀下，全国科学工作者，为了贯彻科学为人民服务、理论联系实际的方针，大家都以高度的劳动热情，参加了新中国伟大建设事业的各个方面：在调查地上和地下资源、规划工业基地建设和根治水灾、提高农业和某些工业生产技术水平、反细菌战和改进医药卫生以及大量培养技术干部等等工作方面，获得了不少的成就，同时，在科学的理论研究方面，也提供了一定的贡献。五年来的经验，使我们深深地体会到：只有人民自己掌握了政权，科学事业才能够这样迅速而且切实地进展。但是它进展的速度，现在还远赶不上国家当前迫切的要求。任务大、力量小是普遍存在的矛盾，显然一时还不能完全克服。这样就要求我们全体科学工作者更好地组织起来，更好地发挥一切潜在的力量。为了作好这些工作，首先我们必需清理我们自己的思想，提高我们自己的业务水平。
    解放以来，我们的自我思想改造学习已经有了很大的收获，解放前遗留下来的宗派思想、个人英雄主义等等已经在科学界受到了广泛的批判。今后，我们还需要继续努力，肃清这些恶习可能残留下来的影响，进一步加强团结，发挥集体智慧，提倡集体创造，才能集中力量更有效地解决我国伟大的社会主义建设事业中必须解决的重大而复杂的科学问题。
    几年来，苏联对我国建设提供了伟大无私的援助，大批优秀的苏联专家来到我国帮助我们进行各种建设工作，同时将他们最先进的科学技术经验毫无保留地教给我们。我们的许多科学工作者，不仅跟从苏联专家学得了许多先进的知识和技能，也更深切地体会了苏联专家的热忱和苏联先进科学的优越性。我们只有努力加强学习，学会实在的本领来建设我们的祖国，更加壮大保卫和平的力量，才能酬答苏联人民、苏联共产党和苏联政府的热诚而崇高的友谊。
    学习苏联，不仅要学习它的近代先进科学技术，更重要的是学习如何掌握它的基本精神。苏维埃科学发展的过程告诉我们：只有在马克思列宁主义、也就是在辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义的思想指导之下，科学研究工作才不会陷入错误的途径。值得庆幸的是，中国科学工作者已经通过他们自己的科学研究实践，发觉了这一条唯一的正确道路。最近，北京许多自然科学工作者正准备在自愿自学的原则下组织系统的辩证唯物主义学习；同时，对胡适派资产阶级唯心观点的批判，已经广泛的在社会科学各个领域中热烈地展开。无可怀疑，通过这一类的学习方式，对我国的科学工作者基本理论学习一定有很大的帮助；对批判隐藏的以及加上了伪装的资产阶级思想也一定能起很大的作用。
    我们相信：随着这一学习的进展，一定能够逐步地展开学术性的批评和论争，铲除过去马马虎虎，企图以牺牲真理来换取“一团和气”的恶习。如果我们相信从斗争中求进步，经过斗争来加强团结，那么什么“受了批评一切就完了”的想法是不对的。
    为了彻底解决力量赶不上任务的矛盾，我们必须认真地看待一切有关培养下一代青年干部的问题。这个培养问题，在很大的程度上，也是同团结问题分不开的。青年人是积极的，是爱国的，是爱劳动的，但有时可能有些急躁。老科学家们在今天基本上也是积极的，爱国的，而且他们是经验丰富的，但可能有些保守的倾向。在这种情况下，只有培养者和受培养者互相学习，才能双方同时获得进步，才能保证我们的团结日益巩固。
    今天，祖国交给我们的建设任务是十分重大的，解放台湾、制止侵略、保卫和平的工作，也都要求我们在各个工作部门中加速提高我们的思想和业务水平。让我们同全国人民一起，紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，胜利前进！
  李德全委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我代表中国红十字会完全同意中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会的工作报告和这次会议将要通过的中国人民政治协商会议章程草案，并热烈拥护周恩来副主席所做的政治报告。中国人民政治协商会议已经完成了它代行全国人民代表大会职权的历史任务，今后将作为中国人民民主统一战线的协商机构，继续发挥它的作用。中国红十字会愿意坚决遵守章程草案中所规定的各项准则，为建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国而奋斗。
    中国红十字会是一个人民卫生救护团体。过去我们本着共同纲领的精神，在国内协助政府卫生部门，为保护人民健康和保证国家的社会主义建设做了一些工作；在国际上，对维护世界和平的事业也做了一些努力。
    中国红十字会改组后，立即取得了在国际红十字组织——红十字会协会中的合法地位，把蒋介石卖国集团的伪代表驱逐出去。四年来，我们出席了各种国际红十字会议共十三次。在历次国际会议上，中国红十字会代表团所提出的关于制止朝鲜战争中的各种暴行，反对使用毒气、细菌、原子武器和氢武器，要求缔结五大国和平公约以及呼吁朝鲜和印度支那停战等各项提案和主张，曾经引起国际红十字界人士的广泛注意。
    朝鲜战争中，中国红十字会组织了总数六百余人的七个医防队为朝鲜人民、朝中人民军队和战俘进行医疗卫生服务。朝鲜停战后，中国红十字会又参加了联合红十字会小组，协助战俘遣返工作。
    在平时，中国红十字会重视同各国红十字会之间的友好联系和往来。我们认为红十字会的互助和合作是有助于各国人民的相互了解的。例如，北京苏联红十字医院的建立就是中苏两国人民深厚友谊的具体表现之一。此外，我们曾经捐款救助印度、英国、荷兰、比利时、伊拉克等国水灾灾民。值得特别提到的是自从去年春天以来，红十字会接受政府委托，协助了二万七千余名在华日侨回到日本。这件事在日本引起了普遍的感谢运动，结果促成了中国红十字会代表团访问日本之行。
    这次中国红十字会访日代表团在日本进行了十二天友好的访问，访问了东京、名古屋、京都、大阪、神户五个主要城市。我们参加了各种集会三十六次，同四千五百多人谈了话，同七万多人见了面。我们会见了日本皇族三笠宫等、日本前政府厚生相草叶隆圆，前国务相安藤正纯以及日本各政党、各群众团体、经济界、文化界、新闻出版界、宗教界、医学界、在日华侨和朝鲜侨民等各方面的代表人士。我们在同日本各方面人士和群众的接触中，传达了我国人民对日本人民的友好，说明中日两国应当长久的和平共处，开展经济和文化交流，早日恢复正常关系，共同为维护亚洲和世界和平而努力。我们受到了日本人民全国性的热烈欢迎。大阪召开了四万人以上的欢迎大会，只东京一地就有三十多个团体要求同代表团座谈，六十多个团体要求同代表团见面。日本全国有很多我们没有到过的地区都举行了大会，并作出了欢迎代表团的决议。代表团所到之处，群众夹道欢迎的不下数十万人，很多家庭妇女听到代表团汽车走过，穿着白色工作服跑出来招手欢迎。据说只京都一地一天之内卖出了二万五千张中国国旗。代表团收到了日本全国各地送来的礼品十余吨，信件近四千封。来信中有的诉说他们生活的痛苦；有的表示向往新中国，敬爱毛主席；有的对日本军国主义侵华战争给予中国的损害表示歉意；有的希望加强中日间经济交流和文化交流；有的怀念着中国，要求互相间能够自由来往。华侨对代表团的欢迎尤其非常热烈，东京一地组织了三千五百人的华侨欢迎大会；相反地蒋介石卖国集团所能收买出来反对代表团的却不足三百人，其中还有多一半是受诱骗的小学生，相形之下，更显得丑态百出。为了保护我们的安全，许多群众组织起来昼夜为代表团警卫，放哨，使我们万分感动。
    我们认为代表团在日本所受到的欢迎说明了日本人民热切地盼望着同中华人民共和国建立友好关系和尽速恢复中日两国间的正常关系，同时我国对日本的和平友好精神和各种具体措施亦在日本人民中间产生了深刻的影响。日本人民要求同中国友好，要求和平的愈来愈多了。
    中国红十字会这次访问日本，使日本人民增加了对新中国的理解和认识，直接向日本人民传达了中国人民的友好愿望，对促进中日两国人民的友好有所帮助，并为今后中日两国之间进一步的友好往来造成了一个良好的开端。这些都是有利于维护亚洲和世界和平的。今后我们愿意为加强中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的友谊而努力。
    当我们全国人民正在信心百倍地建设和平幸福的生活的时候，台湾的同胞仍然处在蒋介石匪帮统治的水深火热之中。美国最近更同蒋介石卖国集团加紧勾结，缔结了美蒋“共同防御条约”，企图长久武装占领台湾，并扩大对我国的侵略，准备新的战争。中国红十字会本着人道和和平的宗旨，坚决拥护政府的号召，准备同全国人民一起，为解放台湾贡献一切力量。
    陈经畬委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    听了第一届全国委员会的工作报告，关于中国人民政治协商会议章程（草案）的说明和周恩来副主席的政治报告，使我进一步认识到本会工作的重大意义和过去重大的成就，进一步认识到我们伟大的祖国在保卫亚洲及世界和平斗争中的伟大胜利和目前我们努力的方向。对以上报告和章程（草案），我完全同意，热烈拥护，并保证在自己的岗位上，努力予以贯彻。
    我们知道：有了全国人民代表大会，人民政治协商会议的工作并不是就可减轻。为了全国人民更紧密地团结一致，以战胜国内外的反动敌人，人民政协需要在过去已有的基础上，继续发挥其作用。这次大会是在第一届全国人民代表大会会议胜利闭幕后不久召开的。全体五百多位委员，代表了全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和其它爱国民主人士。这是我国充分运用协商方式，加强全国人民更巩固的团结一致，进一步发挥大家的力量，共同努力于社会主义建设的一次大会；同时，也就是在目前全国人民团结一致的巩固基础上，进一步扩大和加强人民民主统一战线，为解放台湾、保卫世界和平而斗争的一次大会。
    五年以来，我们私营工商业者在中国共产党和人民政府的教育和培养下，已有很多的进步。特别是我们伟大祖国在各个战线上的辉煌成就以及各种具体的事例，非常有力地教育了我们，使我们广大工商业者的思想认识在不同程度上都有了很大的提高。例如今年武汉的大水是近百年来所未见的。在一九三一年国民党反动统治时期，武汉曾在水位低于今年很多时便破了堤，当时工商业者和全市人民不知有多少人因此破产丧命。而今年我们在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下胜利地战胜了洪水。我们工商业者，在防汛运动最紧张的时候，仍能维持日常营业。这对我们说来，不能不是一个奇迹。这种具体事实对于武汉工商业者的教育是非常深刻的。但是，无可讳言，我们工商业者由于阶级本质的限制，一般的进步还是远远地落在国家形势之后。例如对于接受社会主义改造，虽则我们都经过过渡时期总任务和宪法等一系列的学习，但仍有不少工商业者在思想上存在顾虑，甚至在行动上还有抽逃资金、拖垮企业等不应该有的违法行为。这种情况是足以严重地影响全国人民的团结，并招致重大的损失的。所以爱国的工商业者必须严格地检查自己的缺点，批评自己各种不正确的思想和错误的行为，并且彼此督促帮助，进一步地改造我们的企业和改造我们自己，同全国人民一同前进。
    美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团自然是不会甘心于其可耻的失败，不会愿意我们国家日趋繁荣强大的。现在，美帝国主义好战分子在其一系列的侵略阴谋失败之后，与签订所谓巴黎协定、准备武装西德的同时，在远东同蒋介石卖国贼又签订了所谓美蒋“共同防御条约”，妄图干涉我国解放自己神圣的领土台湾，干涉我国内政，并且威胁我国的安全和亚洲和平。我们又一次地认识到美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的狰狞面目和险恶的阴谋。这个阴谋已引起全国人民最大的愤恨。我们决不能容忍美帝国主义的这种侵略行为，我们一定要解放台湾。我们的事业是正义的，正义的事业一定会得到胜利。我们要教育和团结全国工商业者同全国人民一起，提高胜利的信念，并在解放台湾、保卫祖国的神圣事业中贡献我们最大的力量。
    五年来，我们工商业者中间已涌现了不少先进的积极分子，他们靠拢共产党和人民政府，以身作则，推动广大工商业者爱国守法，改善经营管理，接受社会主义改造，并已起了相当的作用。但是，工商界许多先进分子的工作不是没有缺点的。随着国家的迅速发展，许多先进分子的进步也常常落后于形势的要求，因而不能带动广大工商业者一同前进。这在我自己的工作中就有这样的体会和感觉。所以，我认为在目前形势下，为了社会主义改造，为了对国内外反动敌人斗争的胜利，我们工商业者，尤其是我们负责工商业团体的领导工作的人，首先要提高思想认识，进一步划清敌我的界限。这样才能有助于全国人民进一步的团结一致，争取我们共同事业由胜利走向胜利。
    程潜委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    在全国人民代表大会制定中华人民共和国宪法之后，现在又召开中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议，这是具有重大历史意义的事情。这次会议将有利于加强各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和其他爱国民主人士的团结，加强全国人民在精神上和政治上的高度一致；将有利于进一步组织和动员人民民主统一战线的全体成员，积极参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业；将有利于推动全国人民保卫和平、反对侵略的斗争，特别是有利于推动全国人民解放台湾、彻底消灭蒋贼卖国集团的庄严斗争。
    我们的会议已经听到了周恩来副主席所作的政治报告，陈叔通副主席所作的中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告，章伯钧委员所作的关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明。对上述政治报告、工作报告、章程草案和有关说明，我完全同意和热烈拥护；并赞成会议就上述报告作出相应的决议和通过中国人民政治协商会议章程，作为参加中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和地方委员会的单位和个人在政治生活中、在实际工作中共同遵守的准则。
    五年多来，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会和省、市协商委员会，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，按照“共同纲领”的规定，在各种社会改革运动中，在抗美援朝斗争中，在协助政府动员人民参加政治、经济、文化各方面的建设工作中，在巩固和扩大统一战线的组织工作中，在进行思想改造工作中，都发挥了重要的作用。对此，工作报告作出了概括扼要的总结，报告指出，“中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议及其全国委员会已经光荣地完成了自己的历史任务”。我认为，这样的估价和总结是恰当的，是符合历史真实情况的。现在，作为最高国家权力机关的全国人民代表大会已经召开，作为国家根本大法的中华人民共和国宪法已经制定和颁布实施。原先由中国人民政治协商会议代行全国人民代表大会的职权，现在不再需要由它行使；原先起临时宪法作用的“共同纲领”，其基本内容现在已经列入宪法，并已为宪法所代替。但是，由于我国在过渡时期的人民民主统一战线仍然具有广泛的基础，“今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线将继续发挥它的作用”，所以，中国人民政治协商会议，作为人民民主统一战线的组织形式，需要继续存在。其任务是：“在继续加强工人阶级领导和巩固工农联盟的基础上，经过参加中国人民政治协商会议的各单位在中国共产党领导下的团结努力，去团结一切可以团结的力量，为建设我国成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而斗争，为粉碎一切企图破坏我们国家的内外敌人而斗争，为保卫世界和平和发展人类进步事业而斗争。”从上述任务中可以明显看出，中国人民政治协商会议在中国共产党领导下，在巩固和加强人民民主统一战线的团结工作当中，负担着十分重大的责任。这种以共产党为领导核心的全国各族人民的革命大团结，对我们国家的发展命运具有决定性的意义。刘少奇委员长在“关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告”中指出：“在继续巩固工人阶级领导和工农联盟的前提下，在可能的范围内，人民中间的团结越广，对于社会主义事业就越有好处。”每一个参加中国人民政治协商会议的单位和个人，对巩固和加强团结的重要性应该有足够的认识，这种团结必须是、也只能是基于共同奋斗目标和一致的政治基础上的革命团结，具体来说，就是在拥护和贯彻宪法的实际斗争中的有原则的团结，因此，任何违反宪法精神的言论行动，其结果都是在实质上削弱和危害团结。中国人民政治协商会议章程总纲的规定，工作报告中对今后任务的提出，都同宪法精神完全吻合，我们的义不容辞的职责是：切实遵守总纲的准则，贯彻实现今后的光荣任务。
    我们国家即将进入计划经济建设的第三个年头。谁都知道，我们没有任何侵略他人的意图，我们需要和力争的只是：安定的国际环境和创造性的和平劳动。但是，侵略成性的美帝国主义还侵占着台湾，支持蒋介石卖国集团盘踞台湾继续作恶，不断对我国进行破坏性和骚扰性的战争，并且时刻企图回到大陆上来。最近，美蒋还签订了旨在加剧国际紧张局势、挑起侵略战争的所谓“共同防御条约”。这个“条约”一方面是蒋贼集团署押的卖国文契，另一方面也是美帝国主义明目张胆对我国作进一步侵略挑衅的无耻供状。美国侵略者侵占我国领土，侵犯我国主权，干涉我国内政，企图发动侵略战争，危害远东和世界和平。所有这些，都是我国人民所不能容忍的。我国各民主党派各人民团体早已发表了为解放台湾联合宣言，周恩来外长对美蒋“共同防御条约”也已经发表声明，这次政治报告中又一次义正词严地表明了我们的坚定态度，我表示毫无保留的支持。我们是热烈的和平爱好者，但也是坚定的抗击侵略者。如果说，蒋介石在覆灭前夕同美帝国主义所签订的“中美商约”，尚不能挽回其被驱逐出大陆的悲惨命运，那么，时至今日，当中国人民在抗美援朝斗争中取得杰出的胜利，当我们国家的威力日渐加强的情况下，一纸“共同防御条约”，一条台湾海峡，又怎么能阻挡中国人民解放台湾、竟解放事业之全功的伟大力量呢？美国侵略者现在正挖空心思地对我国进行政治讹诈和诽谤，正力竭声嘶地对我国发出战争叫喊和恐吓，但是，这绝不会丝毫动摇我国人民保卫和平、反抗侵略、不解放台湾决不罢休的钢铁意志，这也必然会遭到我们正义的抵抗和反击。我国人民必须加强工作，从各方面支援解放台湾的斗争。我们的事业是正义的，正义的事业就能把人民磐石般地团结起来，而团结起来所产生的磅礴力量，就一定能胜利解放台湾，就一定能用人民的铁帚把蒋贼政治垃圾涤荡尽净。
    中国人民革命大团结万岁！
    陈铁委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我竭诚拥护周副主席的政治报告，完全同意第一届全国委员会的工作报告和中国人民政治协商会议章程草案。章程草案总纲中的七项共同准则，我一定忠实遵守，努力执行！
    我们国家正处在一个胜利发展的新的阶段。全国人民代表大会已经举行。第一个五年计划第二年度的建设计划已经胜利完成和超额完成。这一次会议的召开，是处在这样一个重要的历史时期。作为团结全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和一切爱国民主人士的人民民主统一战线组织的中国人民政治协商会议，对我们国家的社会主义建设事业，今后必将继续发挥重要的作用。在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，我们满怀信心地向着光辉的前途迈进。
    美帝国主义是妄图破坏我们国家的最凶恶的敌人，它不甘心于在中国大陆上的失败，指使蒋介石卖国集团，盘踞台湾，侵扰大陆，最近更签订了所谓“共同防御条约”。蒋介石卖国集团出卖祖国领土主权的滔天罪行，令我们万分痛恨；美帝国主义霸占我国领土，侵犯我国主权，干涉我国内政，威胁我国和平建设的罪恶勾当，更令我们万分愤慨！台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。美帝国主义妄图以战争挑衅来阻挡我们解放台湾的正义行动，必然要遭受可耻的失败。
    我是一个曾受蒋介石卖国贼欺骗，为蒋介石反动武力服务过的人。当我在一九四九年初步认识了真理，辨明了是非后，我就毅然决然脱离了蒋贼卖国集团，投向人民。几年来，党和政府亲切地关怀我，使我受到了深刻的爱国主义教育，得到了真正为人民服务的机会。现在美蒋签订所谓“共同防御条约”，蒋贼的卖国罪行是更加无耻了。因此，我想到被蒋贼欺骗裹胁尚留在台湾的旧同学、旧同事、旧朋友们，已经到了应该憣然悔悟的最后时机，我希望他们下定决心，弃暗投明，立功赎罪，是一定会受到人民的宽待的。
    最后，我坚决保证，要加强学习，努力工作，在建设祖国、保卫和平的伟大事业中，献出自己的力量，永远跟随着伟大的中国共产党前进！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    姜立夫委员的发言
    我是一个高等教育工作者，这次能参加中国人民政治协商会议，感到非常兴奋。我素来不爱多说话，今天也想讲几句解放以后的感想，来说明自己兴奋的心情。
    我从事高等教育工作已经有三十五年了。四十多年前，我在外国学数学的时候，曾经幻想过回国后能培养一批人才，做些数学上的开辟工作，可是回国后我教的那一个系只有一位学生。解放前学生都不愿进数学系，因为当时数学系毕业的学生大多是做中学教师，而当时的中小学教师是得不到尊敬和重视的，所以我的系总是三人五人一班，我的想法无法得到实现。解放以后，短短的几年中，情况完全改变了，现在我所在的中山大学数学系已有二百五十多个学生，其中三年级的学生就有一百二十人，上我的课的也有八十多人。一与八十之比就显示了旧中国和新中国对待文化科学及培养人才方面的绝大的不同。现在不但同学大多热爱专业，努力学习，教师也能充分发挥自己的力量，安心从事教学工作和科学研究工作，甚至感到自己的能力还赶不上教学工作发展的要求。眼前的现实，胜过了我半生的幻想。要不是中国共产党的领导，中华人民共和国的成立，那能出现这样巨大深刻的变化！从此，我体会到：只有人民掌握了政权的今天，才能为我们科学工作者创造良好的条件，使高等教育得到无限的发展。
    但是这点体会也不是容易得来的。过去我曾经走过弯路，犯过错误。我想在这里谈谈平生两件痛心的事。
    谁都知道，参考资料对研究科学的人是十分重要的。抗战前，我在南开大学教书，学校经费不多，我费了二十年的功夫，搜集了不少的数学参考书，“七七”事变发生以后又费了不少心血，准备把这些书籍转运到云南，结果刚运到海防，日本帝国主义的侵略军就侵入越南，这批书籍大部分都损失了。
    另一件事更为痛心。抗战胜利后，我曾代伪中央研究院筹备数学研究所，在外国买了不少数学书，一九四八年年底，刚刚运到南京。那时人民解放大军准备渡江，国民党反动统治已眼看就要崩溃，我因不了解人民解放军的政策，以为这一来天下可能会大乱，费尽心血找来的书籍又将散失，而安静的念书环境也将被破坏。由于一来舍不得这些书，二来想找个安静的地方进行研究，就错误地跑到台湾，到那边半年后，才知道那边的环境十分恶劣，根本谈不到科学研究工作，这样才又想尽方法回到广州来。我平生一向以为自己只管教书不管政治，而结果恰恰在这方面犯了错误。
    这次经验告诉我，科学工作者也不能脱离政治；这几年的实际情况也告诉我，只有跟着共产党前进，全心全意为人民服务，才能发挥自己的所长。今后我还要认真学习马克思列宁主义，学习苏联的先进教学经验，参加学术研究工作，要认清方向，永远跟着人民一起前进。这样做是需要长期努力的，但我记得古人说过：“学如逆水行舟，不进则退”，政治学习和思想改造也是如此。不跟着社会主义前进，老毛病就会发作，旧错误就会重犯，这是我在思想改造中的一点感想，讲出来请各位先生指正。
    达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措委员的发言主席、各位委员、各位先生：
    在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议召开之后，现在接着召开中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议，首先我对这次会议的召开致以衷心的祝贺。
    在一九四九年九月召开的政协第一届全体会议，代行了全国人民代表大会的职权，制定了共同纲领，组成了中央人民政府。全国人民在中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的正确领导下，根据共同纲领，在各个战线上已经取得了伟大的成就，为在今年召开第一届全国人民代表大会会议准备了良好条件。
    正如在其他各个战线上所取得的伟大成就一样，在民族工作方面所获得的成就也是伟大的：加强了各民族间的团结，巩固了祖国的统一，使伟大的中华人民共和国成为各民族人民团结、友爱、互助、合作的大家庭。
    就以西藏来说：西藏是全国大陆最后解放的，过去受帝国主义侵略较深的少数民族地区，但由于共同纲领所规定的民族政策的正确，我们终于在一九五一年获得和平解放，摆脱了帝国主义的羁绊，回到了祖国大家庭，并由于中国人民解放军进藏部队和进藏工作人员正确地执行了民族政策，使西藏人民日益深刻地感受到祖国大家庭的温暖，和看到他们未来的光明前途，因而西藏人民的爱国主义精神日益增长起来，衷心拥护祖国的统一。
    但是我们绝不能满足于这些成就，蒋介石卖国集团还盘踞在台湾，美帝国主义不愿看到我国日益繁荣富强，还在千方百计地想包围和侵略我们。我们必须时刻提高警惕，进一步加强我国各民族间的团结，巩固祖国的统一。如果帝国主义胆敢来侵犯我们，我们就以各民族人民团结统一的铁拳给以粉碎。
    当然我们团结统一的目的绝不是为了战争，而是为了和平。我们亟需要一个和平的环境，从事建设我们的祖国，好使我国各族人民的经济和文化生活得到不断的提高。但是美帝国主义却极力扶持台湾蒋介石卖国集团，霸占我们的台湾，想把台湾变为他们的军事基地来破坏我国各族人民的和平建设。最近签订的美蒋“共同防御条约”，就是它的这一侵略政策的具体表现。我们要反对这种侵略行为，因为台湾一天不解放，我们的和平建设就一天受着美国的战争威胁。同时台湾是我国领土不可分割的一部分，我国人民一定要解放台湾，对这一决心，西藏人民不但坚决拥护，而且一定给以全力的支援。
    施今墨委员的发言
    我是一个在北京行医四十余年的中医，虽然我诊治过不少病人，然而我终觉得还未能更好地同广大群众取得更密切的联系，为人民服务的精神还是非常不够的。何以说呢？因为大家都知道在反动统治下，无论中西医，都是没有政治地位的。在当时，反动政府对于祖国的医学遗产向来是不曾重视的，再说清楚一点，是听其自生自灭的。在这种情形下，对于每一个人的力量，根本谈不到充分的发挥。现在却大大不然了。我这次能够参加中国人民政治协商会议，固然使我个人感到无限的光荣，但是这光荣绝不是给我个人的，而是给予新中国全体中医的。因为这是说明在中国共产党和毛主席领导的新社会里，中医的政治地位是提高了。
    解放后，在政府重视祖国医学遗产政策下，使中医得到了指导、联系和组织，因而全国的中医能有更多的机会发挥主动性和积极性。特别自本年七月间，听到毛主席对中医工作的伟大号召后，中医同人，个个感动。目前许多医院都设立了中医门诊部。我个人就参加了协和、北京等医院中医部门的工作。在全国各地，也有不少中医，都自动地把自己的祖传秘方公开了。这种行动说明新中国的中医，由于受到政府的鼓励和帮助，都认识到自己已经是国家的主人，自己的技能是应该充分提供出来，为国家和人民服务的。中医的思想水平提高了，中医今后一定要加倍努力，掌握科学知识，把自己的技能更好地贡献给国家和人民。至于中医与西医之间，应如何互相交换知识，观摩学术，以及中医书籍如何整理重编，中医教育如何提高改进，中国药物如何改革和推广等，我在不久前曾经向有关部门提出过意见，现在因为限于时间，我不便更多赘述了。
    同时，经过解放后许多事实的教育，中医都感到本身在政治和技术方面，都有了更大的发展机会，中医对新社会的热爱，也因而与日俱增。正是由于这一点，我们不能不想到尚待解放的台湾同胞，今天还处在水深火热之中，蒋贼的血腥统治还压在他们的肩上。所以中国人民的当前最大的任务，就是解放台湾。
    最近，美帝国主义同蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图长期霸占我国的神圣领土。中国人民对于这种敌视中华人民共和国的侵略行动，都表示极端的愤慨。台湾是我国的领土，我国人民解放台湾是理所当然的事情。我们一定要解放台湾，任何阻挠我们解放台湾的企图，都一定要遭到粉碎！
    唐生智委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意陈叔通副主席的工作报告和周恩来副主席的政治报告，完全同意中国人民政治协商会议章程草案，愿意遵守章程并为它所规定的新任务而努力。
    中国人民政治协商会议，是中国人民民主统一战线的组织形式，是全国人民实行革命大团结的一种最重要的具体方式。五年来，由于全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和一切爱国民主人士在中国共产党领导下的坚固团结和共同奋斗，胜利地实行了共同纲领，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议及其全国委员会已经光荣地完成了自己的历史任务。现在，第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议已胜利召开过了；我们已经把过去五年来所获得的成就和现在正在进行的事业写进了中华人民共和国宪法，中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的基本内容也已经列入宪法。中国人民政治协商会议代行全国人民代表大会的职权的任务虽已经结束，但在今后动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对国内外敌人的斗争中，中国人民政治协商会议作为人民民主统一战线的组织将在我国的政治生活中继续发挥它的作用。因为“在工人阶级领导下的全国人民的革命大团结，不只是对于我国人民民主革命是需要的，对于实现社会主义事业也同样是需要的。”正如刘少奇委员长说过的：“因为在我们面前还站着帝国主义。同时，在我国给人们选择的道路，实际上只有两条，或者是重新受帝国主义的奴役，或者是实现社会主义。中国要独立、民主和富强，只有走社会主义一条路。在这种情况下，凡是不愿意做殖民地奴隶的爱国的人们，就有在工人阶级领导下团结起来接受社会主义道路的可能。在继续巩固工人阶级领导和工农联盟的前提下，在可能的范围内，人民中间的团结越广，对于社会主义事业就越有好处。所以，我们的宪法应当是一个全国人民大团结建设社会主义社会的宪法。”而中国人民政治协商会议今后主要的任务，也就是团结国内外一切可以团结的力量，全力贯彻宪法的实施，为把我国建设成为一个社会主义国家而斗争。
    我们的团结的基础是十分巩固的，我们团结的规模是十分广大的，在历史上是空前未有的。我们的团结过去是建立在共同纲领之上，现在是建立在中华人民共和国宪法之上。帝国主义和反动派虽然仍在千方百计地企图破坏这种团结，但是，我们相信，世界上已经没有一种力量能够阻碍和破坏中国人民的这种革命大团结了。正如毛主席在新政协筹备会开幕词中所说的：“这个统一战线是如此巩固，它具备了战胜任何敌人和克服任何困难的坚强的意志和源源不竭的能力。”
    为了发展和巩固我们的团结，我们应当通过各民主党派、人民团体和人民协商机关继续启发和指导各界人民的自我教育和自我改造运动，加强领导各界人民学习马克思列宁主义，学会使用批评和自我批评方法，这是毛主席指示我们的：“是推动大家坚持真理、修正错误的很好的方法。”为了发展和巩固我们的团结，我们应当提倡和发扬民主作风，要善于同人商量办事，要善于同有不同意见的人商量，反复协商，集思广益，对工作是有好处的。为了发展和巩固我们的团结，我们参加统一战线的单位和个人，都应当分清敌友，辨别是非，大家都把精力集中于工作和与人民有益的事情上。我们应当本着诚恳坦白、实事求是、知无不言、言无不尽之义，有建议，有批评，有自我批评，大家互助互勉，自己进步，也要多多帮助别人进步，大家彼此成为直友、诤友、益友。
    “我们正在前进。我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。”我们很“忙”，从区乡一直到中央，都是忙的，因为我们要和时间赛跑，不得不忙，不能不忙。忙不要紧，我们希望大家能进一步做到忙而不乱，减少一些不必要的忙，忙而有最大成绩，最要紧的是忙而不要损害健康。这就要求我们大家要更严格地有计划地来办事，按计划来办事。
    我们的敌人是不甘心我们的胜利和我们的建设的。最近美帝国主义竟敢冒天下之大不韪，同窃踞台湾的蒋贼卖国集团签订“共同防御条约”。这是一个彻头彻尾的侵略性的战争条约。我们绝不容许历史重演，我们更要加强团结，从各方面加强工作，全力支援人民解放军解放台湾，不达目的，誓不罢休。
    毛主席指示我们：“我们的事业是正义的。正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。”周总理也指示过我们：“我们的社会主义建设事业和社会主义改造事业是正义的，我们的解放台湾、维护我国主权和领土完整、保卫远东和世界和平的事业也是正义的。”“我们正义的事业不仅能够团结全国人民，而且能够得到一切国际朋友的支援。”“我们能够团结全国人民，我们也能够同一切国际朋友团结在一起，这就是我们建成社会主义社会的基本保证。”
    让我们更加坚强地团结起来，在伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党和我们伟大的导师和领袖毛主席领导之下，为我们共同的正义事业而奋斗到底。
    楚图南委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我对于周恩来副主席的政治报告表示衷心的拥护，对于陈叔通副主席的工作报告和章伯钧委员的关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明表示完全同意。
    在周恩来副主席的政治报告中，着重地指出今后中国人民政治协商会议需要继续发挥作用，继续加强自己的工作，其中推动全国人民加强保卫世界和平、促进国际合作和和平共处是重要的工作任务之一。这完全符合我国宪法序言中所规定的“在国际事务中，我国坚定不移的方针是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力”的总的精神。这表现了全中国人民的伟大坚强的意志，同时也符合各国人民的共同的利益和要求。这是因为在二十世纪五十年内经历了两次世界大战的各国人民，一般都已深刻地认识到，战争只是带给人民以恐怖和灾难、不可补偿的不幸和损失，而和平则可促进人类的繁荣和进步，使各国人民相互了解，彼此合作，并进行经济贸易和文化交流，从而推动人类进到文明、进步和幸福的将来。
    但是，这种和平必须建立在互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则的基础之上，才会是巩固的和平和持久的和平。事实证明，不同社会制度、不同政治信仰的各国人民，和平共处是完全可能的。例如我国同印度、缅甸这两个邻邦，通过双方总理的会谈已经确立了以五项原则为基础的新的和平友好关系。这种关系的建立不仅由于中印人民、中缅人民之间存在着悠久的文化友好联系，而更重要的是因为中国人民、印度人民和缅甸人民，今天都需要一个和平环境。对于这些国家的人民来说，和平共处已经不是可能不可能的问题，而是生活本身所迫切需要和渴望的。当然，这种需要和渴望也同样存在于亚洲其他国家和全世界人民的现实生活中，他们同样地要求和平。因此，中印、中缅总理的联合声明和五项原则的确立，已经获得亚洲其他各国和全世界人民的热烈反应。我们相信，亚洲和平地区将继续扩大，全世界人民要求和平共处的呼声将越发坚强有力。
    事实证明，通过贸易来往和文化交流来促进各国人民的友好关系，这是达到世界各国和平共处的有效方法。人类的经济生活和文化生活是一个不可分割的整体，无论哪一个国家都不可能孤立起来发展。因此，人们从自己的生活出发，要求相互贸易并交流文化成果，而这些活动又使得他们在物质上和精神上的联系更加密切，使彼此的互助合作、和同情的了解和真诚的友谊更加增进，因此可以更有效地促进和推动世界的持久和平和人类文化的迅速进步。中华人民共和国成立以来，我国人民就一直在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，发扬我国人民爱好和平的优良传统，坚决奉行和平政策，同各国人民进行贸易来往、文化交流和其他友好性的活动。五年来这些活动都在不断地发展。通过这些活动，我们不仅学习了苏联和人民民主国家在经济文化建设上的先进经验，并有助于整个和平民主社会主义阵营的坚强团结和世界各国人民的和平友好联系，因而扩大和加强了全世界以苏联为首的和平力量。就以最近的事实来说，今年国庆节，我们邀请了东西方许多国家的文化友好代表团来我国访问参观。这些代表团的朋友们通过到各地的参观访问和同各方面人士的广泛接触，不但了解到新中国建设的和平性质，普遍地感到中国人民乐于同各国人民进行经济文化交流以及这种交流对于人类物质文化生活和世界和平的重要性，而且也表达了各国人民要求同中国人民友好合作的愿望。例如英国文艺科学界代表团这次携来了英国文化界六百七十余位著名人士对中国文化界致意的签名信。代表团团长霍克斯教授在递交这封致意信时说：“正如我们六个人代表六百多人一样，我们深信这六百多个人代表千万个其他的人，这些人和我们一样地渴望应该作出一个真正的努力来扩大思想交流，鼓励知识流通，促进我们两个国家之间的同情和了解。”代表团团员、哲学家艾尔教授曾经在北京大学讲演，并同我国哲学家进行热烈的讨论。艾尔教授临别以前和返英以后，都表示这些讨论是愉快的，因为它说明不同信仰的人们相互了解和做朋友是完全可能的。我们认为，世界任何不同社会制度、不同政治信仰的各国人民和学者们正如英国人民和艾尔教授一样，一般都希望同中国人民友好合作，同中国文化界人士交朋友，来实现一个如霍克斯先生所说的
  “更好、更互相了解的和平幸福的世界”。为了这个世界，我国人民将继续努力来加强同各国人民发展友好关系和促进文化交流的工作。
    必须指出，在全世界人民要求和平共处的今天，某些国家的少数当权分子却在鼓吹实力政策，实行其发动和扩大侵略战争的阴谋。最近美帝国主义者同蒋介石卖国集团签订了一个企图扩大侵略、准备新的战争的条约，即所谓“共同防御条约”。这个条约，是美国帝国主义继马尼拉条约和巴黎协定之后，妄想加深世界分裂、奴役世界人民和加紧准备新的世界战争的整个侵略体系的另一个环节。中国人民有决心要保卫祖国的领土完整和主权，一定要解放台湾，歼灭蒋介石卖国集团。亚洲和太平洋各国人民一定会团结起来，击破马尼拉条约及美帝国主义在亚洲和太平洋区域的其他战争条约，来卫护自己的和平生活，正如欧洲人民要粉碎巴黎协定来拯救自己的民族不再沦于纳粹铁蹄之下一样。我国周恩来外长在关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明中说：“中国人民热烈地要求和平，但是决不会拿自己的领土和主权作代价乞求和平。牺牲领土主权，只能导致进一步的侵略，决不会得到真正的和平。中国人民懂得，只有反抗侵略，才能保卫和平。”这些话充分说明了中国人民的态度和决心。实力政策和侵略战争，同和平共处的五项原则是绝对不能相容的。我们相信，在这二者之间，全世界人民一定会作出明智的抉择和勇敢的斗争；而加强贸易来往、文化交流和友好的国际活动将是推动和开展这一工作的重要方式和有力手段之一。因此我们必须从思想上重视这方面的工作，并努力做好这方面的工作。
    总之，我国人民将遵循着宪法的规定和这次会议所指出的工作任务，发挥高度爱国主义和国际主义的精神，提高社会主义的政治觉悟，来建设我们繁荣富强的祖国，来保卫祖国的安全和亚洲以及全世界的持久和平。为了这神圣崇高的目的和完成这一艰巨而光荣的任务，我们必须继续努力，有领导而又有计划地、主动而又积极地从各个方面和通过各种形式，来加强同世界各国人民的友好联系和经济文化交流工作，进一步巩固和扩大和平力量，从而胜利地保障我国伟大的和平建设事业和人类和平、幸福和文化进步的美好的将来。
    盛丕华委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我对周恩来副主席的政治报告和陈叔通副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告，以及章伯钧委员关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明，表示完全同意和拥护。
    中国人民政治协商会议五年多来，在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，代行了全国人民代表大会的职权；动员和团结了全国人民反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国安全，保卫国际和平；协助政府动员人民进行各种革命运动及建设事业以及推动和组织各界人士的思想改造运动等各项巨大的工作，发挥了重要的作用，巩固和扩大了全国人民的团结；从而也就使国家的各项建设工作更顺利地进行。今天，中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议已经举行，中华人民共和国宪法已经颁布，中国人民政治协商会议全体会议代行全国人民代表大会职权的任务已经结束。但是为了胜利地实现国家在过渡时期的总任务，也就更需要统一和集中全国人民的力量，因此，中国人民政治协商会议这一人民民主统一战线的组织，在国家进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造以及反对内外敌人的斗争中，就必须进一步地巩固和发展，继续发挥它的作用。
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会的工作是有成就的。但在工作报告中也指出了：了解反映各方面人民意见和宣传解释各种政策时事问题的活动不够经常和宽广。我想这是完全正确的。这一缺点，我们在地方上担任工作的委员更应多负一些责任。我自己是在上海市担负着工作的，上海是一个私营工商业比较集中的地区，上海市是国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作的重点之一。因此，进一步把过渡时期的总任务以及国家有关政策法令广泛深入地向工商界群众宣传解释；同时，及时地把改造过程中所产生的问题，了解反映给有关方面，并依情况需要，提供适当的建议，这就有助于各项问题的及时解决，也就是使改造工作能顺利进行，也就是使工商界群众能积极接受社会主义改造和全国人民更紧密地团结起来。但是在这一方面的工作，我们做得还是有所不足的，尤其是对面广户多、情况较为复杂的中小工商业的工作更有所不足，这是需要我们在今后工作中努力加以改进的。
    各位委员！我们的国家正在进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造。我们需要和平，而且抗美援朝的斗争经验证明，我们是有力量保卫和平的。美帝国主义不甘心于它过去的失败，最近更加疯狂地制造国际紧张局势，同蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”，企图长期霸占台湾，这是我们绝不容忍的。我们绝不为美帝国主义的威胁所吓倒，我们一定要继续加强反对美帝国主义侵犯的斗争，解放我国的神圣领土台湾，保卫祖国安全，保卫世界和平。目前的局势，需要全国人民更加紧密地、努力地动员和团结起来。尤其像上海这些沿海地区，处在对敌斗争的前线，我们更应该提高警惕，严防匪特破坏、造谣、挑拨等活动。我们工商业者同全国人民在一道，参加这个伟大的、正义的反侵略斗争是光荣的。我们大家必须贡献出一切力量，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，进一步发挥人民民主统一战线的重要作用，以积极接受社会主义改造、参加社会主义建设的实际行动，来支援解放祖国领土台湾的斗争，并为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗！
