Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: According to a broadcast from "Voice of Vietnam" radio station: On December 22nd, the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam People's Army, Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote a letter to all officers and soldiers of the People's Army.

The letter stated: On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the army, on behalf of the Party and the government, I commend all officers and soldiers who have continuously strived and completed glorious tasks during the eight or nine years of the war of resistance, growing from a few small guerrilla units at the beginning to the powerful army of today.

The letter stated: In the face of the new situation, your task is to serve as a solid backing for the struggle to consolidate peace, defend the motherland, realize unification, and complete the nationwide independence and democracy. This struggle will involve many hardships, but it will surely be victorious. Your task is arduous, but very glorious.

In the letter, Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on all officers and soldiers to maintain and enhance their fighting will, and strive to compete in learning military and political affairs, so as to make the People's Army increasingly strong in order to complete this glorious task.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 22nd: Vietnam News Agency reported from Hanoi on December 22nd: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, issued an order to all commanders and fighters of the Vietnam People's Army on December 22nd, the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam People's Army.

The order said: The history of our People's Army's fighting and construction is the history of a small country's armed resistance against the aggression of an imperialist country. This is the history of the armed struggle of a vanguard Party, which led the people to rise up against aggression and achieved brilliant victories in building the army and in the national liberation struggle.

The order pointed out: Due to the achievements made during the war of resistance, the armistice agreement was signed in Geneva, and peace has been restored in Indochina on the basis of respecting the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of our country and the two brotherly countries of Laos and Cambodia. Since the entry into force of the armistice agreement, the Vietnam People's Army, like the people of Vietnam, has strictly implemented and respected this agreement.

The order said: However, the U.S. imperialists, the French colonialist war-mongers who are undermining the agreement, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique have engaged in serious and systematic violations of the armistice agreement, such as concluding the Manila Treaty, dragging South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc; forcing many Catholics to go to South Vietnam; persecuting those in the South who participated in the war of resistance and those who love peace; and preparing to equip and train Ngo Dinh Diem's army with American weapons and military personnel. The purpose of these conspiracies by the U.S. imperialists, the French colonialist elements who are undermining the agreement, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is obviously to undermine the Geneva Agreement, undermine peace, and turn South Vietnam into a U.S. military base and colony.

The order said: The above-mentioned conspiracies completely violate the wishes of the people of our country, the people of France, and the peace-loving people of the world, and we must struggle to crush these conspiracies.

General Vo Nguyen Giap then, in the name of the Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, ordered all commanders and fighters to: raise vigilance, consolidate and promote fighting spirit; actively study political and military art, strive to improve political level and awareness, improve strategies and tactics, and implement Chairman Ho Chi Minh's instruction to "strengthen the People's Army to defend the motherland and defend peace"; strictly implement the policies of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and actively participate in local work.

The order concluded: Under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the Party, and the government, our People's Army is determined to complete the following task: "Consolidate peace, defend the motherland, and become a strong pillar for the political struggle of all the people to realize unification, achieve independence and democracy throughout the country."

    越南人民军建军十周年纪念日
    胡志明主席向全军干部战士祝贺
    武元甲总司令向全体指战员发布命令
    【新华社二十二日讯】据“越南之声”电台广播：胡志明主席在二十二日越南人民军建军十周年纪念日写给人民军全体干部和战士一封信。
    信中说：值此建军十周年纪念日之际，我代表党和政府表扬在八、九年抗战中不断努力和完成光荣任务的、从起初一些小的游击队成长为今天这样强大的军队的全体干部和战士。
    信中说：在新的形势面前，你们的任务是要作为巩固和平、保卫祖国、实现统一、完成全国的独立和民主的斗争的稳固后盾。这一斗争要经过许多艰难困苦，然而一定胜利。你们的任务是艰巨的，但是很光荣。
    胡志明主席在信中号召全体干部和战士保持和提高战斗意志，努力竞赛学习军事和政治，使人民军日益强大以完成这一光荣任务。
   【新华社二十二日讯】越南通讯社河内二十二日讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军在二十二日越南人民军建军十周年纪念日，向越南人民军全体指挥员和战斗员发布命令。
    命令说：我们人民军的战斗和建设的历史就是一个小国武装抵抗一个帝国主义国家的侵略的历史。这是先锋的党的武装斗争的历史，这个党领导人民起来反抗侵略并且在建设军队和在民族解放斗争中获得了种种辉煌的胜利。
    命令指出：由于在抗战当中获得的成就，在日内瓦签订了停战协定，和平已经在尊重我国及老挝和柬埔寨这两个兄弟国家的主权、独立、统一和领土完整的基础上在印度支那恢复了。从停战协定生效以来，越南人民军同越南全国人民一样，严格地履行了和尊重了这项协定。
    命令说：但是，美帝国主义者、破坏协定的法国殖民主义战争贩子和吴庭艳集团却从事了严重而有系统的违反停战协定的行为，如缔结马尼拉条约，把南越、老挝和柬埔寨拉入东南亚侵略集团；强迫许多天主教徒到南越去；对南部曾参加抗战的人和爱好和平的人们进行迫害；准备用美国武器和军事人员来装备和训练吴庭艳的军队。美帝国主义者、破坏协定的法国殖民分子和吴庭艳集团的这些阴谋的目的显然是要破坏日内瓦协定，破坏和平，并且把南越变成美国的军事基地和殖民地。
    命令说：上述的阴谋完全违背了我国人民、法国人民和世界上爱好和平的人民的愿望，我们必须进行斗争来粉碎这种阴谋。
    武元甲将军接着以越南人民军总司令的名义，命令全体指挥员和战斗员们：提高警惕，巩固和发扬战斗精神；积极地学习政治和军事艺术，努力提高政治水平和觉悟，改进战略战术，执行胡志明主席提出的“加强人民军以保卫祖国和保卫和平”的指示；严格执行越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的政策，并积极地参加地方工作。
    命令最后说：在胡志明主席、党和政府的领导下，我们人民军决心完成下述任务：“巩固和平，保卫祖国，成为全体人民为在全国实现统一、获得独立和民主所进行的政治斗争的强固支柱”。
