    A Miracle in Road Building History
    —Kang-Tibet Highway Communications
    By our staff reporter Shen Shi
    This is a highway of peace. When the flames of American imperialist aggression burned to the Yalu River, when American imperialism occupied our Taiwan and the Seventh Fleet ran rampant in the Taiwan Strait, the Chinese people continued to engage in peaceful socialist construction with one heart and one mind. The highway built on the Kang-Tibet Plateau will connect the interior of the motherland and Lhasa more closely.
    This is a highway of national unity. The five years of building the highway have been five years of increasingly close unity between the Han and Tibetan peoples. The cars running on this highway carry not only ordinary supplies, but also the unity and friendship between our country's nationalities.
    This is a highway with arduous engineering. It runs across the "Roof of the World," crossing fourteen high mountains, crossing the main streams of the Jinsha River, Lancang River, and Nujiang River, passing through quicksand, glaciers, and cliffs, and passing through forests, earthquake zones, and swampy areas, with an average altitude of more than 3,000 meters. Thousands of workers and soldiers, relying on their hands, relying on steel chisels, iron hammers, iron picks, and explosives, opened up a road of 2,255 kilometers. Who can deny that this is a miracle in road building history?
    At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the great butcher Zhao Erfeng marched into Tibet and also built roads and opened plank roads on the Kang-Tibet Plateau. However, Zhao Erfeng built roads to conquer the Tibetan people. Even today, the Tibetan elders still can't forget Zhao Erfeng's massacres in the Jinsha River and Lancang River areas. Late at night, as long as the mother said "Marshal Zhao is coming," the children would immediately stop crying. The Tibetan people do not need such roads.
    The Kuomintang bandits also built roads in Kangding and Garze. Their roads were destroyed as soon as they were built; their roads were for suppressing and provoking the Tibetan people. "To have a peaceful year, you have to kill the 'barbarians'," "Giving the 'barbarians' an inch is worse than beating them." The Tibetan people do not need such roads.
    Foreign "explorers," such as Sven Hedin and the like, once used the guise of exploration to steal Tibetan cultural relics and treasures and pave the way for aggressors.
    Here, it used to be called "barren," called "poor mountains and bad waters, barren land"; is the Kang-Tibet Plateau really poor in mountains and water? When there are no clouds for miles, the vast blue sky, the towering snow-capped mountains, the green lakes and marshes, the flying springs and waterfalls in the valleys, and the herds of cattle and sheep on the grasslands, can we say it is barren? The inexhaustible mineral deposits underground, the boundless primeval forests, the cold currents containing a large amount of power, and the pear and peach trees full of fruit, can we say it is barren land? In the beautiful rivers and mountains of the plateau, have the feudal dynasties and Kuomintang bandits ever done any construction? Have the hardworking and brave Tibetan people received any help from the reactionary rulers? Just take the road as an example, what kind of roads have they been walking for generations? From Garze to Lhasa, it takes three months to ride a horse, and it is impossible to pass when there is heavy snow. Merchants traveling between Yunnan and Lhasa have to detour through the middle of Tibet. People could have taken the shortcut through Bomi, but the Nujiang River is in the east, the steep Niuchanggou blocks the middle, and the quicksand poses a great threat, making the warm climate of Bomi isolated from the outside world for many years.
    How much the Tibetan people want a wide and flat road in their hometown! When the good news of road construction reached their hometown, many Tibetan men and women drove yaks, mules, and horses, running day and night on that thousand-mile transportation line. When the road reached the foot of Sejila Mountain, Tengba Kanqiong, director of the Gongbu District Transportation Support Committee, rushed to Lulang, opened the engineering blueprint, measured the route, and said happily: "The road is not far from Lhasa." Tengba Kanqiong's words expressed the Tibetan people's longing for a road.
    The Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong deeply care about the Tibetan people. When the People's Republic of China was just established, it was decided to build a highway on the Kang-Tibet Plateau. Comrade Mao Zedong earnestly taught the road construction workers: "In order to help fraternal ethnic groups, do not be afraid of difficulties and work hard to build roads."
    Historically, there are very few materials left. Building roads on the "Roof of the World" is truly an extraordinary thing, and everything has to start from scratch. The highway is to run across the plateau, but there are no detailed maps, no records of hydrology, earthquakes, and temperature, and no data on terrain and geology. What route will it take, how many mountains will it cross, how many rivers will it cross, no one knows! No one has experience in building roads on the plateau. How to excavate cliffs, how to remove frozen soil, how to conquer quicksand... all have to be explored! Some of the road builders grew up in the plains, and some came from low-altitude mountains, and they have to adapt to life on the plateau! And this plateau, the climate changes several times a day, the air is thin, and newcomers always feel short of breath. But with the spiritual encouragement and material support of the people of the whole country, even if there are more difficulties, they must be overcome! Look at what is used on the construction site, what people wear, eat, and live, which one does not come from the far side of the motherland? Look at the bundles and bags of condolences, look at the letters that the girls of Beijing No. 12 Girls' Middle School often send to the Zhang Fulin class of a certain regiment, which one is not full of the feelings of the people of the motherland?
    After five years of experience, what was once a battle team that has repeatedly made meritorious deeds is now a skilled road construction army. The political commissar of the construction headquarters and many veteran cadres who have been tempered by revolution can now be called experts in highway engineering. Surveyors have traveled all over the mountains and rivers, found a reasonable route, and become familiar with the plateau. People have endured hunger and cold and overcome nature, paving the highway on the "Roof of the World."
    For five years, road builders have lived in tents, sometimes pitched on high mountains, sometimes in forests, and sometimes by shallow water. In Que'er Mountain, the tent is pitched on the snow, with a layer of dry branches spread on the snow, which people call "steel wire bed"; when they sleep until midnight, the snow melts, and water flows under the bed, which people call "tap water." Sometimes the tent is crushed by the snow, and it is pitched up again. The sentry has to sweep the snow on the tent every once in a while. In the morning, the quilt is covered with a layer of frost, the clothes are covered with a layer of frost, and even the hair is covered with a layer of frost. People who sleep with hats on will press their heads tightly against the tent cloth, and when they get up in the morning, the hat is frozen on the tent. For five years, from Erlang Mountain to Bahe, east of Tai Zhao, the road builders have carried tents many times and pitched tents many times. Every time the tent moves westward, it means that the highway has progressed.
    For five years, the road builders and steel chisels and iron hammers have become close partners. On the cliffs on the west bank of the Nujiang River, on the banks of the Lengqu River, and under the Anjiula Mountain, they insert steel chisels, tie ropes, and perform aerial work. A two-meter-long steel chisel has to be worn down by more than thirty centimeters in more than forty days. In more than 2,000 kilometers of road, how many cubic meters of stone have been opened, how many steel chisels have been worn, and how much sweat has been soaked in the stones piled on the river bank, rolled to the cliffs, and paved on the road surface.
    A couplet stands at the bridgehead of the Nujiang River: "Heroes come out from both sides of the Nujiang River, and good men are revealed in the deep mountains and valleys." Indeed, in the process of construction on both sides of the Nujiang River, many heroic figures have emerged, such as the river-crossing hero Li Wenyan, the exploration hero Cui Ximing, the engineer Zhang Tianxiang who explored the road on the cliff on the bank of the Lengqu River, and the Tibetan compatriot Zha Xi, all of whom showed incomparable strength and bravery. Not only are there moving deeds on both sides of the Nujiang River, but there are people worthy of praise and moving stories everywhere on the 2,000-kilometer line, from the Qingyi River to the Lhasa River, from Erlang Mountain to Minla.
    If you ask those who are looking for routes on the plateau, which one has not climbed dozens of mountains and waded across dozens of rivers? Which one has not drilled through the jungle thorns, not been stung by Urtica fissa, not been sucked by leeches? When you see someone wearing a dark blue canvas suit, you don't need to ask, it must be a surveyor. It is not difficult to imagine that the hard and thick suit is specially sewn for them. They are the people walking at the forefront of the road construction team, and they are the people who suffer the most. Let's talk about Yu Jiong's survey team! They surveyed another section of the route between Changdu and Lhasa, which lasted one year and four months, traveled more than 10,000 li back and forth, crossed 72 mountains, waded across more than 600 large and small rivers, and surveyed more than 3,200 kilometers of comparative lines. On the road, they lost contact with the team headquarters for three months. Don't think that the above list is all boring numbers, it is not boring, it shows the hardships they have tasted and shows their determination to find routes on the plateau. It is these people who are not afraid of hardships who have found a reasonable route and become familiar with the plateau that is called a "mystery."
    When you meet the person in charge of the highway at the construction headquarters, he will tell you how the people of the motherland are supporting this highway. He will say that, in addition to the food and clothing of the People's Liberation Army participating in road construction, the cost of building this road, if converted into RMB 5,000 yuan notes, each note in a row, arranged in nine rows, can stretch from Tiananmen Square in Beijing to the Potala Palace in Lhasa. If this cost is converted into rice according to the Chongqing price in March this year, and loaded with trucks with a load capacity of 3.5 tons, one car after another, it can be arranged from Manigange at the eastern foot of Que'er Mountain to Lhasa.
    When you are in the construction site and meet those who are wearing blue clothes or light green military uniforms, some of them are holding shovels and steel hammers, and some are carrying iron baskets, digging shovel by shovel, shoveling shovel by shovel, and carrying basket by basket. Every inch of soil, every pinch of mud, every stone has been paid for. They have been exposed to rain and sun, and have eaten wild vegetables and porridge. They are all people who work hard. They have firm confidence and perseverance, Erlang Mountain, Zhedo Mountain, Que'er Mountain..., one after another has succumbed to them.
    If you ask those bridge workers how many bridges they have built in deep water and rapids. In the cold winter, people are sitting around the stove to warm themselves, but what about them? Building bridges on rivers full of floating ice. This summer, floods flooded, and they continuously repaired four steel bridges along the Bolong Zangbu (River) for seven days and seven nights. They issued a vow that "the road will be open and the bridge will be open," and cars drive day and night on the bridges of the Qingyi River, Dadu River, Lancang River, and Nujiang River...
    When you meet those lumberjacks in the towering forest, they will tell you how they walk back and forth in the forest, stepping on moss and swamps; how they are accustomed to the smell of decaying leaves; they cut down large trees one by one and carry them down the mountain one by one. Because the bridgehead crossing, the glacier of Suowaka, the quicksand of Mi Mi area, and the swampy area of Qunima all need wood!
    If you meet the ironworkers who are hammering steel chisels around the stove, the supply workers who are busy allocating and transporting materials all day long, the drivers and Tibetan laborers who are running day and night on the transportation line, the doctors and nurses who are rescuing the wounded and overcoming various "mountain sickness," the postal and telecommunications and bank workers who are constantly advancing with the construction site and serving the construction site..., they will tell you many vivid people and many vivid things.
    Friends! When you start from Ya'an and drive west by car, you can reach Lhasa in just over ten days. You don't have to spend three months riding a horse. In Erlang Mountain, you can see a horizontal plaque on the top of the mountain with the four characters "贯通康藏" (Guan Tong Kang Zang - Connecting Kang and Tibet) inscribed on it. This is the bold statement left by the road builders when they conquered the first mountain, which is also their oath. This oath has become a reality today. When you cross the Dadu River, you will imagine the scene of the Red Army's Long March when they crossed the Dadu River. Today, the large steel and concrete bridge across the two banks is far away from the ancient iron chain bridge. You will think that from the Long March of the Red Army to the present, the Chinese people have experienced thousands of trials and tribulations, overcome countless difficulties and obstacles, have stood up earth-shakingly, and have become a powerful pillar to defend world peace. When you pass the western foot of Que'er Mountain and look at the cemetery of Martyr Zhang Fulin, your heart will surely be filled with sincere respect. You will think that this highway was not easily built. Some lovely people have given their precious lives. When you are on the road and see one road maintenance team house after another, and see some Tibetan compatriots settle down near the road maintenance team house, you will imagine that in a few years, these places will develop into towns. When you see cars loaded with materials driving westward in an endless stream, you will think that the highway has brought happiness to the Tibetan people. When the car climbs the snow line on the high mountain and passes the highway on the cliff, please think about those road builders. They have experienced five years, overcome many difficulties, and paved the highway on the "Roof of the World," creating a miracle in road building history.

    筑路史上的奇迹
    ——康藏公路通讯
    本报记者　沈石
    这是一条和平的公路。当美帝国主义侵略的火焰烧到鸭绿江边的时候，当美帝国主义侵占我国的台湾，第七舰队横行在台湾海峡的时候，中国人民继续万众一心地从事和平的社会主义建设。修筑在康藏高原的公路，将使祖国内地和拉萨更加紧密地联系起来。
    这是一条民族团结的公路。修筑公路的五年，就是汉藏两族人民日益亲密团结的五年，行驰在这条公路上的汽车，装载着的不只是普通的物资，而且是我们国家民族间的团结和友谊。
    这是一条工程艰巨的公路。它横贯“世界屋脊”，翻过十四座大山，越过金沙江、澜沧江、怒江等主流，经过流沙、冰川和悬崖绝壁，通过森林、地震区和泥沼地带，平均海拔高达三千公尺以上。成千上万的工人和战士，凭着双手，凭着钢钎、铁锤、铁镐和炸药，开出一条二千二百五十五公里的路来。谁不承认这是筑路史上的奇迹？
    清末，大屠夫赵尔丰进兵西藏，也曾在康藏高原上修过路，开过栈道。但是，赵尔丰修路，是为了征服藏族人民。直到今天，藏族父老还忘不了赵尔丰在金沙江、澜沧江一带的大屠杀。深夜，母亲只要说一声“赵大帅来了”，孩子们会立刻停止啼哭。藏族人民是不需要这样的路的。
    国民党匪帮也曾在康定、甘孜修过路。他们的路，随修随毁；他们的路，是为着镇压、挑拨藏族人民。“要过太平年，除非蛮杀蛮”，“让蛮一寸，不如打蛮一顿”。藏族人民是不需要这样的路的。
    外国的“探险家”，如斯文赫定之流，曾打起探险的幌子，来盗窃西藏的文物宝藏，为侵略者开路。
    这里，过去被人称为“蛮荒”，称为“穷山恶水，不毛之地”；难道康藏高原真的山穷水恶吗？当万里无云的时候，辽阔的蓝天，巍峨的雪山，碧绿的湖沼，山谷间的飞泉瀑布，草场上成群的牛羊，能说它荒凉吗？那地底下取之不尽的矿藏，那一望无际的原始森林，那含蓄着大量动力的寒流，那果实累累的梨树和桃树，能说它是不毛之地吗？在高原上的锦绣河山，封建皇朝和国民党匪帮有过丝毫建设吗？勤劳、勇敢的藏族人民，反动统治者对他们有过半点帮助吗？仅仅拿路来说，他们世世代代走着什么样的路呢？从甘孜到拉萨，骑马得三个月，碰到大雪封山，还不能通行。来往云南、拉萨间的商人，都得绕道西藏的中路。人们本来可以走波密这一条近路，但是，怒江横在东边，险峻的牛场沟拦在中间，而流沙又造成了大的威胁，使气候温暖的波密，长年和外间隔绝。
    藏族人民多么想望在自己的家乡有一条宽坦的路呵！当修路的喜讯传到他们的家乡，多少藏族男女，赶着牦牛、骡、马，在那千里运输线上日夜奔波。公路通到色齐拉山下，贡布地区运输支援委员会主任籐巴堪穷赶到鲁朗，打开工程蓝图，量量线路，高兴地说：“公路离拉萨不远了”，籐巴堪穷的话，表达着藏族人民盼路的心情。
    中国共产党、毛泽东同志深切地关怀着藏族人民，当中华人民共和国刚成立不久，就决定在康藏高原上修筑一条公路。毛泽东同志谆谆教导筑路员工：“为了帮助兄弟民族，不怕困难，努力筑路。”
    历史上遗留下来的资料少得可怜。要在“世界屋脊”上筑路，真是一件不平凡的事，一切都得从头来起。公路要横贯高原，但没有详尽的地图，没有水文、地震、气温的记录，没有地形、地质等资料。它将走什么样的线路，越过多少山，跨过多少河，都心中无数啊！谁都没有高原上筑路的经验，怎样开凿悬崖绝壁，怎样拨掉冻土，怎样征服流沙……，都得经过一番摸索啊！筑路的人有的生长在平原地区，有的来自海拔低的山地，得适应高原生活啊！而这高原，气候一日数变，空气稀薄，初来的人总是感到呼吸迫促。但有了全国人民在精神上的鼓舞，在物质上的支援，即使困难再多些，也得克服啊！看工地上使用的，人们穿的、吃的、住的，那一样不是来自祖国的远方呢？看那成把成袋的慰问品，看那北京第十二女子中学的姑娘们经常给某团张福林班的来信，那一件不是充满了祖国人民的心情呢？
    经历了五个年头，过去是屡建功勋的战斗队，现在是一支熟练的筑路大军。那饱经革命锻炼的修建司令部的政治委员和不少老干部，现在称得起公路工程的内行了。勘测人员们踏遍万水千山，找出一条合理的线路，熟识了高原人们忍受过饥寒，战胜了自然，将公路铺上了“世界屋脊”。
    五个年头，筑路的人过的是帐篷生活，帐篷有时撑在高山上，有时撑在森林中，有时撑在浅水边。在雀儿山，帐篷撑在雪地里，雪上铺着一层干树枝，人们叫它“钢丝床”；睡到半夜，雪溶化了，床底下流水，人们叫它“自来水”。帐篷有时被雪压垮了，重新撑起来，放哨的人，每隔一阵，得扫一次帐篷上的积雪。早晨，被面蒙上一层霜，衣服蒙上一层霜，连头发也蒙上一层霜，戴帽睡觉的人，将头紧贴着帐篷布，早上起床，帽子就冻结在帐篷上了。五年来，从二郎山到太昭以东的巴河，筑路的人，背过多少次帐篷，又撑过多少次帐篷，每当帐篷向西移动一次，那就是说公路又进展了。
    五个年头，筑路的人和钢钎、铁锤结成为亲密的伙伴。在那怒江西岸，冷曲河边、安鸠拉山下的悬崖边沿，他们插上钢钎，捆上绳索，进行悬空作业。一根两公尺长的钢钎，四十多天，得磨去三十多公分。两千多公里的路，开过多少石方，磨损过多少钢钎，那堆积在河岸上的，滚到悬崖下的，铺在路面上的石块，又浸过他们多少汗水。
    怒江桥头竖着一副对联：“怒江两岸出英雄，深山峡谷显好汉”。真的，在怒江两岸施工过程中，曾经涌现过很多英雄人物，像渡江英雄李文炎、探险英雄崔锡明、冷曲河岸悬崖上探路的工程师张天翔、藏胞扎喜等，都表现了无比的坚强和勇敢。不但是怒江两岸有着可歌可泣的事迹，那长达两千多公里的线路上，从青衣江到拉萨河，从二郎山到敏拉，每一处都有值得歌颂的人，每一处都有动人心弦的事。
    你问问那些在高原上寻找线路的人，哪一位没有爬过几十座山、涉过几十条河流？哪一位没有钻过丛林荆棘、没有被活麻刺肿、被蚂蝗吮吸过？当你看到有人穿着一身深蓝色的帆布衣服时，你不用问，那一定是勘测队员。你不难想像那套又硬又厚的衣服是专为他们缝的。他们是走在筑路队最前面的人，是吃苦最多的人。谈谈余炯那个踏勘队吧！他们踏勘过昌都、拉萨间另一段线路，历时一年零四个月，来回走了一万多里，翻过七十二座山，涉过六百多条大小河流，勘测出三千二百多公里的比较线。在路上，他们曾经有三个月和队部失掉过联系。不要认为以上列举的都是些枯燥的数字，那并不枯燥，那表明了他们尝过的艰苦，显示出他们在高原上找寻线路的决心。就是这些不畏艰苦的人，找出了合理的线路，熟识了被人称为“谜”的高原。
    当你在修建司令部，会见了公路的负责人，他会告诉你祖国人民是怎样来支援这条公路，他会说，除去参加筑路的人民解放军的给养被服等项，建设这条路的费用，如果折成五千元一张的人民币，每行一张，排成九行，可以从北京的天安门，一直到拉萨的布达拉宫。这笔费用如果按照今年三月重庆的牌价，折成大米，用载重三吨半的汽车装载，一辆接着一辆，可以从雀儿山东麓的马尼根果一直排到拉萨。
    当你在工地里，碰到那些穿蓝色服装或者穿浅绿色军服的人，他们有的拿着铁锹、钢锤，有的挑着铁筐，在一锹一锹的挖，一铲一铲的掀，一筐一筐的挑。每一寸土，每一撮泥，每一块石头，都付出了代价。他们挨过雨淋日晒，吃过野菜、稀饭。他们都是些埋头苦干的人。他们有着坚决的信心和毅力，二郎山，折多山、雀儿山……，一座一座的都向他们屈服了。
    你问问那些桥梁工人，他们在深水和急流里，架过多少桥。严寒的冬天，人们在围炉向火，而他们呢？在飘满浮冰的河上架设桥梁。今年夏季，洪水泛滥，他们在泊龙藏布（江）沿岸，七天七夜，连续抢修四座钢桥。他们发出“路通桥通”的誓言，汽车日夜在青衣江、大渡河、澜沧江、怒江……的桥上行驶了。
    当你在那遮天蔽日的大森林里，碰到那些伐木的人，他们会告诉你，他们是怎样踏着苔藓、泥沼，在森林里来来去去；他们是怎样习惯了腐叶发出的气味；他们将大树一株一株地伐倒，一根一根地抬下山去。因为架桥的渡口，索瓦卡的冰川，密密一带的流沙，曲尼玛的泥沼地，都需要木料啊！
    假若你会见了那围着炉火、锤打钢钎的铁工们，那成天忙着调拨、转运物资的供应工作者们，在运输线上昼夜奔忙的驾驶员和藏族民工们，那救死扶伤战胜了各种“高山病”的医生和护士们，那随着工地不断前进、为工地服务的邮电和银行工作者们……，他们会滔滔地向你叙述许多活生生的人，许多活生生的事。
    朋友！当你从雅安出发，坐上汽车向西驶行的时候，只要十多天，就可以到达拉萨。你用不着骑马花上三个月的时间了。在二郎山，你可见到山顶上的一块横匾，匾上题着“贯通康藏”四个大字。这是筑路的人征服第一座山时留下的豪语，也就是他们许下的誓言。这誓言今天已经成为现实。当你过大渡河，你会想像到红军长征时，抢渡大渡河的情景。今天，横跨两岸的钢骨水泥大桥，和那古老的铁索桥遥遥相对，你会想到从红军长征到现在，中国人民经历了千锤百炼，度过了无数的艰难险阻，已经翻天覆地地站立起来，成为保卫世界和平有力的支柱。当你经过雀儿山的西麓，瞻望张福林烈士的墓园，你的心里一定会发出虔诚的敬意，你会想到这条公路不是轻易筑成的，有些可爱的人，已经献出了他们宝贵的生命。当你在路上，见到那一栋一栋的道班房，见到有的藏胞在道班房附近安起家来，你会想像到若干年后，这些地方将发展成为城镇。当你见到满载物资的汽车，络绎不绝地向西驶去，你会想到公路给藏胞带来了幸福。当汽车爬上高山上的雪线，通过悬崖边的公路的时候，请你想想那些筑路的人，他们经历了五个年头，度过了重重困难，才将公路铺上了“世界屋脊”，造成了筑路史上的奇迹。
