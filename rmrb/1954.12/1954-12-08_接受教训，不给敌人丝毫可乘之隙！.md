    The cracking of the "Chinese People's Livelihood Party" counter-revolutionary organization in Benxi City is another warning bell for us. The details of this case show that any negligence and the slightest loophole in our work can be used by the enemy as a gap for sabotage. The reason why the counter-revolutionary organization "Chinese People's Livelihood Party" was able to lurk within the Benxi Iron and Steel Company for a long time and carry out activities wantonly is inseparable from the company's and the iron smelting plant leadership's underestimation of the enemy, their complacency, and their bureaucratic work style. Before this case was cracked, the iron smelting plant had already discovered the serious incident of Ma Enyou, a KMT secret agent from the Central Unification Bureau, infiltrating the Party and becoming the secretary of a branch. The Party and government leaders of the iron smelting plant also made self-criticisms. However, they did not learn from this incident and placed a person who had concealed historical crimes and had been expelled from the Party in an important position, regarding him as an "activist" and "advanced worker," which gave the counter-revolutionaries an opportunity to exploit.
    What lessons should we learn from this case?
    All economic and enterprise departments must establish and improve production management systems. The reason why counter-revolutionaries like Luan Xiaochen were able to steal a large amount of highly potent medicines and some chemical instruments to manufacture explosives was because the internal systems of relevant departments of Benxi Iron and Steel Company were unsound and the accounts were chaotic. A certain highly potent chemical medicine in the laboratory was stolen by 1,000 cubic centimeters, and one of the only two constant flow devices was also stolen, but the leadership was completely unaware. Even after the case was cracked, it was impossible to determine how much medicine was lost by checking the accounts. These loopholes objectively helped the activities of counter-revolutionaries.
    Economic and enterprise departments should investigate any incidents of responsibility, regardless of their size, find the causes, and clarify the responsibilities. If any suspicious points are found, it is necessary to further investigate whether there are other problems. The phenomenon of paying attention only to political incidents and neglecting incidents of responsibility must be corrected. Counter-revolutionaries like Luan Xiaochen had already shown their true colors, deliberately putting the wrong labels on the pockets of test medicines and disrupting the work of the laboratory. However, the leadership still subjectively believed that Luan would not make mistakes. Even when there was solid evidence, they only regarded it as an ordinary incident of responsibility and did not investigate further, which condoned the sabotage activities of the counter-revolutionaries. Of course, in most of our enterprises, due to the temporary lack of experience of cadres and workers, their low technical level, and their weak sense of responsibility and discipline, it is inevitable that some incidents of responsibility may occur frequently. There is a fundamental difference in nature between these types of responsibility incidents and political incidents caused by the deliberate sabotage of counter-revolutionaries. However, these incidents of responsibility must also be investigated. This is not only because we need to find the causes and formulate reliable systems and methods to prevent accidents, but also because without investigation, it is impossible to judge which are responsibility incidents and which are deliberate sabotage by the enemy. It would be impossible to discover the counter-revolutionaries using responsibility incidents as a cover for sabotage. If the Benxi Iron and Steel Company had conducted an investigation based on the clue of Luan Xiaochen's "wrong" pocket incident, it would not have been difficult to discover their counter-revolutionary activities.
    It is necessary to strengthen the personnel system and confidentiality system of economic and enterprise departments, strictly review personnel appointments, and strictly protect all confidential materials. The laboratory of Benxi Iron and Steel Company is an important department, but let us see who is working here? There was a KMT regimental commander, a KMT policeman, and hooligan soldiers, and then Luan Xiaochen, who had concealed historical crimes and had been expelled from the Party, was sent there. This shows how much the personnel work of Benxi Iron and Steel Company has lost its revolutionary stance, and as a result, these elements were given the opportunity to collude and organize a counter-revolutionary group. In addition, the fact that Luan Xiaochen was able to steal personnel materials shows that the confidentiality system of Benxi Iron and Steel Company was poorly implemented.
    These loopholes in the work and systems of Benxi Iron and Steel Company created gaps for counter-revolutionaries to carry out activities. As a result, the people's property was used by counter-revolutionaries to sabotage the people's revolutionary cause. Fortunately, our public security organs solved the case in time, otherwise it would have caused serious consequences.
    We must learn from this incident, raise revolutionary vigilance at all times and in all places, plug all loopholes, and leave no gap for the enemy to exploit.

### 接受教训，不给敌人丝毫可乘之隙！

    接受教训，不给敌人丝毫可乘之隙！
    本溪市破获的反革命组织“中国民政党”案，再一次向我们敲响了警钟。这个案子的经过说明：任何麻痹大意和工作上的一点点漏洞，都可能被敌人利用为进行破坏的空隙。反革命组织
  “中国民政党”所以能够长期潜伏在本溪钢铁公司内部肆无忌惮地进行活动，是同这个公司和公司的炼铁厂领导方面的轻敌麻痹思想和官僚主义作风分不开的。在这个案子被破获以前，炼铁厂已经发现过蒋匪中统特务马恩友混入党内并当了支部书记的严重事件，炼铁厂的党、政负责人也作了检讨；但是他们并没有接受这一事件的教训，又把一个隐瞒历史罪恶已经被开除党籍的分子安置到重要岗位上，并视为“积极分子”、“先进工作者”，结果就给反革命分子以可乘之隙。
    我们应该从这一案中接受哪些教训呢？
    一切经济企业部门都必须建立与健全生产管理制度。反革命分子栾孝忱等所以能够肆无忌惮地盗窃大量烈性药品和一些化学仪器，制造炸药，就是因为本溪钢铁公司有关部门内部制度不健全，账目混乱。化验室里的某种烈性化学药品，被盗走了一千公撮，仅有的两个定流装置也被盗走一个，而领导上竟毫无所知，一直到破案以后，药品丢了多少，竟至查账也无从查起。这些漏洞在客观上就起了帮助反革命分子活动的作用。
    经济企业部门对于任何责任事故，不问大小，都应该检查，找出原因，明确责任；如发现可疑之处，必须进一步追查有无其他问题。只注意政治事故、忽视责任事故的现象必须纠正。反革命分子栾孝忱等本来早已露出了马脚，故意装错化验药品的口袋，破坏化验室的工作就是一例。但是领导上仍然主观地偏信栾犯不会错；直到有了确凿的证据，又只认为这是普通的责任事故，仍不追查，这就放纵了反革命分子的破坏行为。当然在我们多数企业中，由于干部和职工暂时缺乏经验，技术不高，以及责任心和遵守劳动纪律观念不强等原因，不可避免地可能经常发生一些责任事故。这类责任事故和反革命分子的故意破坏所造成的政治事故，在性质上是有原则区别的。但是对这类责任事故也必须追查。这不仅因为要找出原因，并针对它订出防止事故的可靠的制度和办法，而且不进行追查，就无法判断哪些是责任事故，哪些是敌人的故意破坏，反革命分子假借责任事故作掩护进行破坏活动也就无从发现。本溪钢铁公司如根据栾犯孝忱的
  “装错”口袋事件的线索进行追查，是不难发现他们的反革命活动的。
    必须加强经济企业部门的人事制度、保密制度，用人必须严格审查，一切机密材料必须严格保管。本溪钢铁公司化验室是一个重要部门，但是让我们看一看在这里工作的有哪些人呢？有蒋匪建军排长，有蒋匪警察，有流氓兵痞，以后又派去了隐瞒历史罪恶已经被开除党籍的栾犯孝忱。这就说明本溪钢铁公司的人事工作做得多么失掉革命的立场，结果就给这些分子以狼狈为奸组织反革命集团的机会。另外栾犯孝忱所以能够偷看到人事材料，这又说明本溪钢铁公司的保密制度是执行得很坏的。
    本溪钢铁公司在工作上、制度上的这些漏洞，就给反革命分子造成了活动的空隙。结果，人民的财产被反革命分子利用去破坏人民的革命事业。幸我公安机关及时破案，否则必将造成严重的后果。
    我们必须接受这一事件的教训，随时随地提高革命警惕、堵塞一切漏洞，不给敌人丝毫可乘之隙。
