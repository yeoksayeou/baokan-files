Reaction to Criticism and Suggestions

    Ball Skins and Bladders Can Be Sold Separately
    A letter from the China General Merchandise Company: A People's Daily reader's letter suggested that basketball, volleyball, and soccer ball skins and bladders should be sold separately to avoid waste. This suggestion is very good. According to the demands of the masses, we have decided to sell ball skins and bladders separately.

    球皮球胆可以分别出售
    中国百货公司来信：人民日报读者来信希望篮、排、足球球皮和球胆分别出售，以免浪费。这个意见很好，我们已根据群众的要求，决定把球皮和球胆分别出售。
