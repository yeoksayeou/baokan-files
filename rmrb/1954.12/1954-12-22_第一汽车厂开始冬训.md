    First Automobile Works Begins Winter Training
    The construction site of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has successively started winter training work since the beginning of December. Those participating in the training include grassroots management personnel (mainly foremen), engineering and technical personnel, professional cadres, general cadres, and some skilled workers. This year's winter training is to prepare for next year's construction. During the winter training, special attention will be given to training workers in special trades such as electricians, waterproofing workers, and mechanics.
