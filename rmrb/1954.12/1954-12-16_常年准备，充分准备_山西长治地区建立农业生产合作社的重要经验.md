Constant Preparation, Full Preparation
    ——Important Experiences in Establishing Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Changzhi Area, Shanxi
    Chen Guobao
    In order to conscientiously implement the principle of "active leadership, steady progress" in the agricultural collectivization movement, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province has absorbed a major experience from the past four years of developing agricultural production cooperatives this year, which is "constant preparation, full preparation." The core of the preparatory work is to cultivate a group of mutual aid teams in a planned way as a reliable foundation for establishing agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee required that the establishment of cooperatives be combined with the rectification of mutual aid teams, and that each cooperative should be linked to several mutual aid teams. As a result, the production of the mutual aid teams was improved, which aroused great interest in moving towards agricultural production cooperatives. In this situation, in order to further overcome the shortcomings of the general preparatory work for establishing cooperatives, in early June, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee instructed each county to formulate a plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives in 1955 based on possible conditions, and to focus on cultivating a group of mutual aid teams that would be reliable foundations for establishing cooperatives after the autumn harvest, based on the development plan. In early July, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee held a mutual aid and cooperation conference in each county to conduct a review. Each county also convened cadre meetings and cooperative director meetings in mid-July to further implement the policy of leading the teams with cooperatives and making full preparations.

    On this basis, each county selected nearly 10,000 mutual aid teams as key targets for cultivation. After brewing during the summer production campaign, the conditions for establishing cooperatives in many mutual aid teams were largely mature. By August, 157,302 households had preliminarily formed 3,264 new cooperatives (some had signed up to join old cooperatives). This year, a series of new features have emerged in the process of preparing to establish cooperatives:
    First, ideological preparation is relatively mature. This is the result of active education and enlightenment, and allowing farmers to consider it for a long time. For example, among the more than 8,000 farmers who signed up in Tunliu County, 64 percent sincerely felt that cooperatives could increase production and income. They were mostly poor peasants and new middle peasants, and were the main force in developing new cooperatives; 26 percent followed the previous group without any concerns and joined the cooperatives. They were mostly ordinary old middle peasants who actively supported the cooperatives as long as they could improve production; about 10 percent had ideological problems. They were mostly wealthy middle peasants who were forced by the situation (the households in the original mutual aid team had all joined the cooperative, they felt they had labor shortages, and they were afraid of being isolated) to reluctantly sign up. From this point of view, the thinking of 90 percent of the members is basically mature.
    Second, there have been some economic connections and cooperation has been gradually implemented in production. This is the basic sign of ideological maturity and the inevitable result, laying a material foundation for future new cooperatives. The mutual aid teams preparing to establish new cooperatives partially implemented collective management in the spring and summer, jointly reclaiming wasteland, raising pigs, and raising sheep. After the summer harvest, some mutual aid teams had already collectively managed wheat fields, such as 78 teams in Qinshui County that separately implemented collective returning to the stubble, collective autumn sowing, centralized manure accumulation, jointly operating flour mills, and buying livestock. Mutual aid teams preparing to join old cooperatives also extensively cooperated with agricultural production cooperatives. For example, Zhang Qiliang's team in Nanzhang, Changzi County, and the cooperative jointly purchased five waterwheels, and Zhang Guijin's team in Xiaozhonghan gave its pigsty to the cooperative, saying, "We will be one family after the autumn harvest." In Lingchuan County, 356 teams signed cooperative contracts with 214 cooperatives, 12 cooperatives and 14 teams exchanged 46 mu of interspersed land, 39 cooperatives and 75 teams reclaimed 624 mu of wasteland, and collectively planted hemp and other oil crops, and 80 cooperatives and 35 teams jointly bought 535 sheep. In Huguan, 500 mutual aid teams cooperated with cooperatives to repair 480 ditches, build 53 sheepfolds, repair 245 mu of滩地, and sow 440 mu of barren hills. Some had already handed over their wheat fields to the cooperatives for unified management.
    Third, the leaders within the cooperative are selected early and seriously. This is the biggest concern of all cooperative members and an important condition for whether the cooperative can be run well. Therefore, everyone is very cautious when choosing leaders, and even selects them two or three times before finalizing them. When selecting, great attention is paid to the two conditions of fairness and competence.
    Fourth, mutual aid teams are merged in a planned way. This is an inevitable trend and necessary step brought about by the first three characteristics. In Gaoping County, 416 teams were merged into 151 teams in preparation for establishing cooperatives, which facilitated the concentration of idle funds to purchase public means of production; of these, 98 teams accumulated public accumulation funds after the summer harvest to buy 89 head of livestock and 297 pieces of agricultural implements. One mutual aid team in Niujiazhuang wanted to establish a cooperative but did not have an accountant, so it automatically merged with another mutual aid team. Not only did it have a good accountant, but it also had two relatively strong leaders.
    After a long period of brewing in the spring and summer, the important ideological, backbone, and organizational preparations for establishing cooperatives in many villages are completely mature or largely mature, laying a solid foundation directly for developing new cooperatives and expanding old cooperatives after the autumn harvest. Doing so also has many benefits: First, it can resolve the contradiction between establishing cooperatives and current production, so that new cooperatives can steadily and orderly engage in autumn plowing and winter production after the autumn harvest is largely completed; second, it can resolve the contradiction between establishing cooperatives and current urgent tasks (such as the unified purchase and sale of grain), so that other urgent tasks can be carried out smoothly; third, it can resolve the contradiction between establishing a large number of cooperatives and the lack of cadre strength, because putting the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives into the entire production process of spring, summer, and autumn greatly reduces many troubles when establishing cooperatives. Only key assistance and universal inspection are needed; fourth, it can avoid the phenomenon of hastily establishing cooperatives in a few days, without sufficient brewing, without carefully selecting cooperative cadres, and resulting in a crude establishment.
    According to the experience of the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to implement this method of constant preparation, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education for existing cooperatives, do a good job in the operation and management of existing cooperatives, and make existing cooperatives demonstrate their superiority in the summer harvest pre-distribution; it is also necessary to conduct socialist education for the broad masses and improve their awareness in combination with various tasks. In addition to this, leadership should be strengthened in the following aspects:
    First, not only should a development plan be made, but also regular and systematic inspections should be carried out. After the Prefectural Committee led each county to formulate a plan for developing 2,740 new cooperatives in June, it led each county to hold cadre meetings and mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings in July and August to centrally inspect the progress of the preparatory work for establishing cooperatives twice. After the inspection in each county, the Prefectural Committee convened a cadre meeting of the County Party Committee Office to inspect twice. The focus of the inspection was the plan and the actual preparatory work. This overcame the two tendencies of being rough and not paying enough attention to the preparatory work. For example, Qinshui County found that five cooperatives did not meet the conditions, so it guided them to re-seriously prepare the conditions and select backbones; Houquan Village, Licheng County, originally planned to merge three teams of 40 households into one cooperative, but after inspection, it was found that only a few people were active and the majority of the masses had poor awareness, and the conditions for establishing a cooperative were not met, so they were persuaded to continue running the team and create conditions.
    Second, focus on strengthening leadership and overcome the general style of work. It is necessary to fully use agricultural cooperatives to universally drive mutual aid teams, improve the quality of mutual aid teams in production activities, and improve their production technology, ideological awareness, and the ability of backbones to run cooperatives. The following methods can be adopted to use key cooperatives to improve mutual aid teams: (1) Organize mutual aid teams to visit the production and other work of agricultural cooperatives on the spot; (2) Regularly convene joint meetings of cooperative directors and mutual aid team leaders centered on the base point central cooperative to exchange experiences; (3) Summarize and exchange the experiences of each central cooperative in helping mutual aid teams improve by county on a quarterly basis. Facts have proved that these three forms are extremely effective.
    Third, it is necessary to especially grasp the work of cultivating backbones. In addition to improving backbone members through the above-mentioned method of exchanging leadership experience, the Changzhi area generally trained approximately 25,000 cadres including cooperative directors, accountants, and some team leaders and group leaders before autumn, with the county as the unit. The basic principles, policies, and leadership methods of establishing cooperatives were systematically taught to them, enabling them to have the ability to fight independently.
    Fourth, in the entire preparatory work process, in addition to conducting general line education, the members of the mutual aid teams are led to study the model charter of agricultural production cooperatives, so that they can receive charter education and establish the concept of handling affairs in accordance with the charter after the establishment of the cooperative.

    常年准备，充分准备
    ——山西长治地区建立农业生产合作社的重要经验
    陈国宝
    为了在农业合作化运动中认真贯彻“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，中共山西省长治地委今年吸收了四年来发展农业生产合作社的一条主要经验，就是“常年准备，充分准备”。准备工作的中心，是有计划地培养一部分互助组作为建立农业生产合作社的可靠基础。因此，长治地委今年一开始就要求建社和整顿互助组相结合，要求各个社都联系几个互助组。这样做的结果，提高了互助组的生产，引起了互助组向农业生产合作社方向迈进的极大兴趣。在这形势下，为了进一步克服建社准备工作一般化的缺点，长治地委六月上旬指示各县，依据可能的条件，制订一九五五年度发展农业生产合作社计划，并依据发展计划，有重点地培养出一批足以作为秋后建社可靠基础的互助组。七月上旬，长治地委召开各县互助合作会议，进行了一次检查。各县也在七月中旬普遍召开干部会议、社长会议，进一步深入贯彻以社带组、充分准备的方针。
    在这基础上，各县挑选了近万个互助组作为重点培养对象。经过在夏季生产运动中酝酿，有许多互助组建社的条件大体成熟。到八月间，就有一五七、三○二户初步组成三、二六四个新社（有一部分是报名入老社）。今年在准备建社的过程中，表现出一系列新的特点：
    一、思想准备比较成熟。这是积极教育启发和让农民长期考虑的结果。如屯留县报名的八千多农户中，有百分之六十四真心实意感到合作社能增加生产增加收入，他们多系贫农和新中农，是发展新社的主力军；有百分之二十六无顾虑地跟上前一部分人走，也进了社，他们多系普通老中农，只要社能把生产搞好，也是积极拥护者；有百分之十左右思想不通，他们多系富裕中农，为形势所迫（原来互助组的户都入了社，感到劳动力困难，又怕孤立）而勉强报名。这样看来，百分之九十的社员的思想是基本成熟的。
    二、经济上已有一些联系，生产上逐步实行合作。这是思想成熟的基本标志和必有的结果，给未来的新社打下了物质基础。准备建立新社的互助组，在春夏就部分地实行了集体经营，合伙开荒、养猪、养羊；夏收后，有一些互助组已经集体经营了麦田，如沁水有七十八个组分别实行集体回茬、集体秋播、集中积肥、合伙开粉坊、买牲口。准备参加老社的互助组，也广泛地和农业生产合作社合作生产。如长子县南漳张启良组和合作社合置水车五部，小中汉张贵金组把猪圈让给合作社使用，说：“秋后就是一家人了。”陵川县三百五十六个组和二百一十四个社签订了入社合同，十二个社和十四个组调换了插花地四十六亩，三十九个社和七十五个组开荒六百二十四亩，集体播种了大麻等油料作物，八十个社和三十五个组伙买羊五百三十五只。壶关五百个互助组和社合作修渠四百八十条，打羊窑五十三孔，修滩地二百四十五亩，荒山播种四百四十亩，有的已把麦地交给了合作社统一经营。
    三、及早认真挑选出社内的领导人。这是全体社员最关心的大问题，也是社能不能办好的重要条件。因此，大家在选择领导人时十分慎重，甚至挑选两三次才确定了。选择时十分注意考察公道和能干两个条件。
    四、有计划地合并互助组。这是前三个特点带来的必然趋势和必要步骤。高平县四百一十六个组为准备建社合并为一百五十一组，这就便于集中游资购买公共生产资料；其中九十八个组夏收后积累公积金买耕畜八十九头、农具二百九十七件。牛家庄有一个互助组想办社没会计，自动和另一个互助组合并了，不但有了一个好会计，并且有了两个比较强的领导人。
    经过春夏两季长期的酝酿，许多村庄为建立合作社的思想上、骨干上、组织上的重要准备工作，都完全成熟或大体成熟，直接为秋后发展新社扩大旧社奠定了巩固基础。这样做，还有许多好处：一、可以解决建社和当前生产的矛盾，秋收大体结束后新社就可以稳步地有秩序地投入秋耕及冬季生产；二、可以解决建社和当前紧迫任务（如粮食统购统销等）的矛盾，使其他紧迫任务得以顺利进行；三、可以解决大批建社和干部力量不足的矛盾，因为把建社准备工作放到春夏秋三季的整个生产过程中，就大大减少了建社时的许多麻烦，只要重点帮助、普遍检查就可以了；四、可以避免短短几天突击建社、不能充分酝酿、不能认真挑选社的干部以致建社粗糙的现象。
    根据中共长治地委的经验，要实行这种常年准备的办法，就要坚持对现有的社加强思想教育，把现有的社的经营管理工作做好，使现有的社在夏收预分中表现出它们的优越性；还要结合各种工作，经常对广大群众进行社会主义教育，提高群众的觉悟。除此以外，还要从以下各方面加强领导：
    第一、不但要做好发展计划，还要经常地有系统地进行检查。地委在六月份领导各县订出发展新社二、七四○个的计划以后，七、八月份领导各县开干部会议和互助合作代表会议，对于建社准备工作进行的情况集中地检查了两次。在各县检查后，地委又召开县委办公室干部会议检查了两次。检查的中心是计划和实地准备工作。这样做，克服了粗枝大叶和不十分重视准备工作的两个偏向。如沁水县检查出五个社不够条件，就指导他们重新认真准备条件、挑选骨干；黎城县侯泉村原来打算把三组四十户并一社，检查后发现只是少数人活动，多数群众觉悟差，不够建社条件，就说服他们继续办组，创造条件。
    第二、抓住重点加强领导，克服一般化的作风。要充分运用农业社普遍带动互助组，在生产活动中提高互助组的质量，提高他们的生产技术、思想觉悟和骨干的办社能力。运用重点社提高互助组，可以采用这样一些办法：（一）组织互助组就地参观农业社的生产和其他工作；（二）定期地以基点中心社为中心召开社长和互助组长联席会议，交流经验；（三）逐季以县为单位总结和交流各个中心社帮助互助组提高的经验。事实证明这三种形式效果极好。
    第三、要特别抓紧培养骨干工作。除用上述交流领导经验的方式提高骨干分子以外，长治地区今年秋前以县为单位普遍训练社长、会计和部分队长、小组长干部共两万五千人左右，较系统地把建社的基本原则、政策和领导方法等知识教给他们，使他们具备单独作战的能力。
    第四、在整个准备工作过程中，除了进行总路线教育以外，并且领导互助组组员学习农业生产合作社示范章程，使他们接受社章教育，树立建社后按社章办事的观念。
