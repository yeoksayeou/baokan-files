Comrade Chairman, Fellow Representatives:

Please allow me, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, to speak at this conference in the capacity of an observer.

The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that the Soviet Government's proposal in its note of November 13 this year to convene an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system is a major and timely effort to safeguard peace in Europe and the world. The Government of the People's Republic of China fully agrees with and supports the Soviet Government's proposal.

Although the Soviet Government's proposal has received enthusiastic support from peace-loving countries and people around the world, it has been rejected by the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and some other European countries, thus preventing this conference on European collective security from becoming a conference attended by all European countries. This is certainly regrettable, but the responsibility lies solely with the United States and its followers, the British and French governments. Because what they want now is not to establish a European collective security system through negotiations and agreements among the parties concerned to maintain lasting peace in Europe, but to strive for the rapid ratification of the Paris Agreements, to arm West Germany, to strengthen opposing military blocs, to permanently divide Germany and Europe, and to prepare for a new war.

The Chinese government and the Chinese people resolutely oppose the Paris Agreements, which aim to revive German militarism, establish aggressive military blocs, and prepare for a new war. We believe that it violates all international agreements concerning the German question, has nothing in common with the tasks of consolidating European security and restoring German unity, and is clearly a major challenge to world peace by the American aggressive bloc and its British and French followers. It is well known that if this agreement is ratified, if the conspiracy of aggressive forces can succeed, it will seriously undermine the cause of restoring German unity through all-German free elections, seriously hinder the possibility of negotiations among countries to resolve the German question and other European issues, and lead to tense relations between European countries, thereby intensifying the arms race and greatly increasing the military burden on the people of European countries. This will not only worsen the situation in Europe, but also exacerbate the entire international tension.

The American aggressive bloc attempts to dominate the world by relying on the so-called "policy of strength." Its aggression and war plans not only threaten Europe, but also threaten Asia and other places. As everyone knows, in Asia, it is actively arming Japan, establishing military bases, and recently organized the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. It occupies China's territory of Taiwan, interferes in the just cause of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, an exercise of sovereignty, and conspires to sign a so-called "common defense treaty" with the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique. It uses all kinds of conspiracies and tricks to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, opposes the independence and unity of Asian countries, and attempts to consolidate and expand its colonial rule in Asia. Just as in Europe, the American aggressive bloc in Asia is also preparing for a war against China, the Soviet Union, and other Asian countries and peoples.

The aggression and war plans pursued by the American ruling clique and its foreign followers threaten world peace and the security and independence of all countries, not only increasing the military burden and deteriorating the lives of the people of all countries, but also exposing them to the danger of a new war far more cruel, destructive, and devastating than the First and Second World Wars. This plan only benefits a small handful of monopoly capitalists in the United States and certain countries that follow it, but it harms the interests of the people of all countries. The series of actions of actively arming West Germany, pulling West Germany into an aggressive military bloc, and rejecting European collective security show that the American ruling clique and its followers are determined to be enemies of the people of Europe and the world, and insist on their aggression and war plans regardless of everything. This cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world.

The aggressive and war plan that the American ruling clique and its followers are now pursuing is very dangerous and therefore must be stopped and defeated. At the same time, precisely because this aggressive and war plan violates the interests of all countries and peoples, threatens their survival and lives, it has been met with the growing opposition of all peace-loving countries and peoples, and therefore this arrogant plan can also be stopped and defeated. The powerful peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union has become even stronger and more consolidated, and has become a strong bulwark for safeguarding world peace. Their policy of striving for peace and easing international tensions has won the sympathy and support of people all over the world. The peace forces of the people of other countries in the world are developing rapidly. This is no exception in the United States. More and more people and countries are calling for peace, opposing war, and advocating peaceful coexistence. The rising national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are a huge force for upholding peace and opposing war. All of this shows that the peace forces in the world today are powerful. The American aggressive bloc and its British and French followers attempt to use the so-called "policy of strength" to impose their will on others, threaten the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and achieve their aggressive aims. This attempt will not work and is doomed to failure. The Soviet Union and the People's Democracies insist on a policy of peace because these countries need a peaceful environment for construction, because peace is beneficial to the people of all countries, and not because these countries are afraid of the imperialists' so-called "strength." The experience of the Second World War has proven that aggressors cannot conquer countries and peoples who are determined to fight for peace, democracy, and independence with "strength," and it is precisely those aggressors who advocate "strength" who are ultimately crushed.

The American ruling clique's aggression and war plans can not only be defeated, but have been repeatedly defeated. After the Second World War, the American aggressive bloc carried out many subversive activities in the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe, attempting to overthrow the people's democratic regimes in these countries, but the result was failure. During the Chinese People's Liberation War, the American aggressive bloc strongly supported the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique, attempting to turn China into its colony, but the Chinese people finally won victory, and the American aggressive forces were driven out of mainland China. The American aggressive bloc's launched the war of aggression against Korea was also repulsed and forced to sign the Korean Armistice Agreement. Its plan to interfere in and expand the war in Indochina has also been frustrated. Therefore, as long as peace-loving countries and peoples strengthen unity and persist in the struggle, the American ruling clique's aggression and war plans will continue to fail and head towards final bankruptcy.

Now, the American aggressive bloc and its British and French followers hope to use the method of reviving German militarism to make the German army the shock force for their aggressive wars and to make the Germans serve as cannon fodder for them. But they fail to see that Germany today is fundamentally different from Germany before the Second World War. Today, there is already a peace-loving German Democratic Republic, leading the people of all Germany to fight for the country's unity, independence, peace, and democracy. Due to historical lessons, the German people have a great understanding and cannot fail to see that arming West Germany will inevitably bring great suffering to themselves. The First and Second World Wars, which were provoked by German militarists, both resulted in disastrous defeats for Germany, and the German people endured enormous sacrifices and pain. If a third world war breaks out, it will cause even more devastating disasters to the German people. Therefore, the policy of the American aggressive bloc and the West German Bonn government of dividing Germany and preparing for war will inevitably be met with the growing opposition of the German people. At the same time, the American policy of arming West Germany, using European countries as tools of aggression, and profiting from it is extremely detrimental to the people of France, Britain, and the entire Europe, and is also detrimental to many bourgeoisies in Western Europe. Because an armed West Germany will directly threaten the security of European countries, especially its neighbors. The experience of the two world wars proves that the victims of German militarization include not only Eastern European countries, but also Western European countries, especially France. The ruling groups of Britain, France, and other Western European countries follow the United States' policy of aggression and war and help the militarization of Germany. In fact, they are repeating the mistakes before the Second World War, "lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet," and will eventually suffer the consequences. The ruling groups of Britain, France, and other Western European countries can forget the painful lessons of the past, but the people of France and other Western European countries, especially the French people, will not forget these lessons. As for the Soviet Union, it once eliminated the aggressive forces of Hitler's Germany in the Second World War, saved the civilization of Europe and the world, and made great contributions to all mankind. This shows that the Soviet Union, which was supported by the people of the world, was already powerful at that time. The current Soviet Union is even more powerful than in the past, and standing with it is the People's Republic of China with its 600 million people and other People's Democracies, thus creating a powerful, peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, united like a rock, and resolutely supported by all peace-loving people and all progressive mankind. Therefore, if the American aggressive bloc and the West German militarists supported by it dare to provoke a new world war against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, then it can be asserted that they will suffer a more tragic fate than Hitler.

However, the American aggressive bloc and its British and French followers fail to see all these changes in the situation and still insist on arming West Germany and preparing for a new war. In this case, peace-loving countries and peoples must be highly vigilant and fully prepared in order to maintain peace, stop war, and ensure their own security. It is precisely because we want to maintain peace that we must not condone war instigators, and we cannot ignore their conspiracies to create war, otherwise it would be tantamount to encouraging the aggressors and allowing their conspiracies to succeed. This is what we Chinese often say, we want peace, but we are not afraid to resist wars of aggression. We advocate cooperation with all countries willing to coexist peacefully and engage in unremitting struggle for world peace, but we cannot be slightest bit paralyzed and careless about the conspiracies of aggressive forces. If the Paris Agreements are ratified, then it is absolutely necessary and reasonable for peace-loving countries, especially the Eastern European countries directly threatened by West German militarism, to take new measures to ensure peace and their own security. As Comrade Molotov, head of the Soviet delegation, pointed out, under the new circumstances, the measures previously taken in this regard are far from sufficient. This requires the countries of the peace and democracy camp to further strengthen themselves, strengthen their national defense and armed forces, strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation between the countries of the peace and democracy camp, and take joint measures in organizing defense. The entire peace and democracy camp must be as strong and solid as a copper wall, so that the conspiracies and tricks of those aggressors can never succeed.

The Chinese people are concerned not only about peace in Asia, but also about peace in Europe. The Chinese people are familiar with the danger of German militarism. The past two world wars were launched by German militarists. These wars not only caused great sacrifices and pain to the people of European countries, but also the scourge of war extended to Asia and China, bringing disasters to the people of China and Asia. Before and during the Second World War, Hitler's Germany and militarist Japan formed an alliance and jointly carried out wars of aggression in Europe and Asia. Now, the entire plan of aggression and war implemented by the American aggressive bloc focuses on arming West Germany and arming Japan. Therefore, the joint communique of the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and Germany on July 25 this year pointed out that "the struggle against the rearmament of West Germany and Japan has become a common task of all peace-loving people." The Chinese people oppose the American aggressive bloc's arming of Japan in Asia and pushing its policy of aggression and war. The Chinese people are fighting for peace in Asia and the security of their country. At the same time, the Chinese people also oppose the American aggressive bloc's arming of West Germany in Europe and pushing its policy of aggression and war. The Chinese people support the struggle for ensuring peace in Europe. The current struggle for peace in Asia and the struggle for peace in Europe are a unified and indivisible common struggle.

The Chinese people are closely watching the development of the European situation and are firmly standing with the Soviet Union, the People's Democracies, and other peace-loving countries and peoples, vowing to fully support their struggle for European collective security and their own security, and to support the German people's struggle for peaceful reunification. The peace policy pursued by the countries of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and the joint struggle for defending peace are in line with the interests of the people of all countries in the world, and therefore will inevitably be firmly supported by the people of all countries. Our cause of fighting for peace is just, and a just cause will surely win victory.

The issues discussed at this Moscow conference are of great significance not only for European security but also for world peace. The refusal of the United States, Britain, France, and other Western European countries to participate further proves the urgent importance of this conference in the cause of maintaining peace and opposing war. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, I would like to state that the People's Republic of China fully agrees with the statements made by Comrade Molotov, head of the Soviet delegation, Comrade Cyrankiewicz, head of the Polish delegation, Comrade Široký, head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Comrade Grotewohl, head of the German Democratic Republic delegation, and other representatives who spoke at this conference, and will fully support the decisions and all measures taken by this conference to ensure peace and security in Europe. We believe that this Moscow conference will surely successfully complete the historical task before it and further strengthen the world's forces for defending peace. This conference once again showed that the countries in the peace and democracy camp have completely consistent views on various issues in the international situation. This unity and consistency among the countries of the peace and democracy camp is an invincible and huge force for defending peace in Europe, peace in Asia, and peace in the world. Now, the people of the world demand peace. No force in the world can stop the continued rise and growth of the forces of the people who demand peace. The power of the peace-loving people is invincible. Victory will surely belong to the people who are fighting for peace!

### 十二月一日在欧洲会议上  我国代表张闻天的发言

专栏：

    十二月一日在欧洲会议上
    我国代表张闻天的发言主席同志、各位代表同志：
    请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府，以观察员的身份在这个会议上发言。
    中华人民共和国政府认为，苏联政府今年十一月十三日照会所提关于召开全欧会议以讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的建议，是对维护欧洲和全世界和平的重大的和适时的努力。中华人民共和国政府完全同意和支持苏联政府的建议。
    苏联政府的建议虽然获得了各个爱好和平的国家和各国人民的热烈支持，但却遭到了美、英、法和其他一些欧洲国家政府的拒绝，因而使这一个讨论欧洲集体安全问题的会议没有能够成为有欧洲一切国家参加的会议。这固然是令人遗憾的事情，但是这只能由美国和追随它的英法各国政府负责。因为它们现在所要的，不是经过有关方面的谈判和协议以建立欧洲的集体安全体系，维护欧洲的持久和平，而是力求迅速批准巴黎协定，武装西德，加强对立的军事集团，长期分裂德国和欧洲，准备新的战争。 
    中国政府和中国人民坚决反对这一旨在复活德国军国主义、建立侵略性军事集团、准备新战争的巴黎协定，认为它违反有关德国问题的一切国际协议，它同巩固欧洲安全和恢复德国统一的任务毫无共同之点，它显然是美国侵略集团和它的英法追随者对世界和平的重大挑战。尽人皆知，如果这一协定得到批准，如果侵略势力的阴谋能够得逞，那么就会使通过全德自由选举来恢复德国统一的事业遭受到严重破坏，使各国就解决德国问题和其他欧洲问题进行谈判的可能受到严重的妨害，使欧洲国家间的关系趋于紧张，从而引起军备竞赛的加紧和大大增加欧洲各国人民的军事负担。这不仅将使欧洲的形势趋于恶化，而且还会加剧整个国际的紧张局势。
    美国侵略集团妄图依靠所谓“实力”政策称霸世界。它的侵略和战争计划不仅威胁着欧洲，而且也威胁着亚洲和其他地方。大家知道，在亚洲，它积极武装日本，建立军事基地，最近还组织了东南亚侵略集团。它侵占着中国的领土台湾，干涉中国人民解放台湾这一行使主权的正义事业，并阴谋和蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防务条约”。它利用一切阴谋诡计干涉亚洲国家的内政，反对亚洲国家的独立和统一，力图巩固和扩大它在亚洲的殖民统治。同在欧洲一样，美国侵略集团在亚洲也正在准备着反对中国、苏联和其他亚洲国家和人民的战争。
    美国统治集团和它的国外追随者所推行的侵略和战争计划，威胁着世界和平和各国的安全和独立，不仅在使各国人民军事负担增加、生活恶化，而且还使他们有遭受比第一次和第二次世界大战远为残酷、毁灭性和破坏性远为巨大的新战争的危险。这一计划只对美国和追随它的某些国家的一小撮垄断资本家有利，但却危害着一切国家人民的利益。积极武装西德，把西德拉入侵略性的军事集团，拒绝欧洲集体安全等这一系列行动表明，美国统治集团和它的追随者决心同欧洲和全世界人民为敌，并不顾一切地坚持他们的侵略和战争计划。这就不能不引起爱好和平的国家和各国人民的严重警惕。
  美国统治集团和它的追随者现在所推行的这一侵略和战争计划是十分危险的，因此是必须被制止、被击败的。同时正因为这一侵略和战争的计划违反一切国家和人民的利益，威胁着他们的生存和生活，因而就遭到了所有爱好和平的国家和人民日益增长的反对，因此这一狂妄的计划也是能够被制止、被击败的。以伟大的苏联为首的强大的和平民主阵营已更加壮大和巩固，已成为维护世界和平的坚强堡垒。它们争取和平和争取缓和国际紧张局势的政策，得到了全世界人民的同情和支持。世界其他各国人民的和平力量正在迅速发展。在美国，这种情况也不例外。要求和平、反对战争、主张和平共处的人和国家已越来越多。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各地日益高涨的民族独立运动，是拥护和平、反对战争的巨大力量。所有这些都说明，目前世界上的和平力量是强大的。美国侵略集团和它的英法追随者，企图用所谓“实力”政策，把它们的意志强加于对方，威胁苏联和各人民民主国家，达到它们侵略的目的，这种企图是行不通的，是注定了要失败的。苏联和人民民主国家所以坚持和平政策，是由于这些国家需要和平的环境进行建设，是由于和平对各国人民都有好处，而决不是由于这些国家害怕帝国主义者的所谓“实力”。第二次世界大战的经验已经证明，侵略者用“实力”是征服不了决心为和平、民主和独立而斗争的国家和人民的，最后被粉碎的正是那些鼓吹“实力”的侵略者。
    美国统治集团的侵略和战争计划不但能够被击败，而且已经被一再击败过。第二次世界大战后，美国侵略集团曾经在东欧各人民民主国家制造许多颠复活动，企图推翻这些国家里的人民民主政权，但结果是失败了。在中国人民解放战争时期，美国侵略集团曾大力支持蒋介石卖国集团，企图把中国变成它的殖民地，但中国人民终于胜利了，美国侵略势力被赶出了中国大陆。美国侵略集团发动的侵朝战争，也被打退了，并被迫签订了朝鲜停战协定。它干涉和扩大印度支那战争的计划，也同样地遭到了挫败。因此，只要爱好和平的国家和各国人民加强团结，坚持斗争，美国统治集团的侵略和战争计划还会继续遭到失败，而走向最后的破产。
    现在美国侵略集团和它的英法追随者指望以恢复德国军国主义的办法，使德国军队做他们侵略战争的突击队，使德国人替他们当炮灰。但是他们看不到，现在的德国已经和第二次世界大战前的德国根本不同了。今天已经有一个爱好和平的德意志民主共和国，领导着全德国人民为国家的统一、独立、和平和民主而斗争。由于历史的教训，德国人民已有很大的觉悟，他们不能不看到，武装西德必将给自己带来重大的苦难。由德国军国主义者所挑起的第一次和第二次世界大战，都使德国遭到惨重的失败，使德国人民忍受了极大的牺牲和痛苦，如果再爆发第三次世界大战，那就更会使德国人民遭到毁灭性的灾难。因此，美国侵略集团和西德波恩政府分裂德国、准备战争的政策，是必然会遭到德国人民日益增长的反对的。同时，美国武装西德、利用欧洲国家为侵略工具、而自己从中取利的政策，对法国、英国和整个欧洲人民也都是极其不利的，对西欧各国的许多资产阶级也是不利的。因为武装起来了的西德，将直接威胁到欧洲各国、首先是它的邻国的安全。两次世界大战的经验证明，德国军国主义化的受害者不但有东欧的国家，而且也有西欧的国家，特别是法国。英法和其他西欧国家的统治集团，追随美国的侵略和战争政策，帮助德国的军国主义化，实际上就是在重蹈第二次世界大战前的覆辙，“搬起石头打自己的脚”，最终必将自食其果。英法和西欧各国的统治集团可以忘记过去的沉痛的历史教训，但是法国和西欧各国的人民，特别是法国人民，是不会忘记这些教训的。至于苏联，它曾经在第二次世界大战中消灭了希特勒德国的侵略势力，拯救了欧洲和世界的文明，对全人类作了伟大的贡献。这就说明，受到全世界人民支持的苏联，在那时就已经是强大的。现在的苏联则已较过去更为强大，而且同它站在一起的还有六万万人口的中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家，从而使世界上出现了一个以苏联为首的、团结得像磐石一样的、强大的、和平民主和社会主义阵营，并得到了一切爱好和平的人民和全体进步人类的坚决拥护。因此，如果美国侵略集团和它支持下的西德军国主义者胆敢挑起反对苏联和各人民民主国家的新的世界大战，那么可以断言，他们将要遭到比希特勒更加悲惨的命运。
    然而，美国侵略集团和它的英法追随者却看不到形势的这一切变化，还是要坚持武装西德，准备新的战争。在这种情况下，爱好和平的国家和人民，为了维护和平、制止战争和保障本身的安全，就必须有高度的警惕和充分的准备。正是因为要维护和平，所以对于战争煽动者就决不能姑息，就不能对他们制造战争的阴谋置之不理，否则就无异于鼓励侵略者，使他们的阴谋得逞。这就是我们中国人经常所讲的，我们要和平，但我们也不怕反抗侵略战争。我们主张同一切愿意和平共处的国家进行合作，为世界和平而作坚持不懈的斗争，但我们对侵略势力的阴谋却不能有丝毫的麻痹和大意。如果巴黎协定得到批准，那么爱好和平的国家，特别是受西德军国主义直接威胁的东欧各国，采取新的措施以保障和平和自身的安全，就是非常必要和合理的了。正像苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫同志指出的，在新的形势下，以前在这方面所采取的措施就大大的不够了。这就要求和平民主阵营国家进一步壮大自己，加强国防和武装力量，加强和平民主阵营各国间的互助合作，并在组织防御上采取共同措施。必须使整个和平民主阵营坚强和巩固得像铜墙铁壁一样，让那些侵略者的阴谋诡计永远无法得逞。
    中国人民不仅关心亚洲和平，同样也关心欧洲和平。中国人民是熟悉德国军国主义的危险的，过去的两次世界大战都是由德国的军国主义者发动的。这些战争不仅使欧洲各国人民受到重大牺牲和痛苦，而且战祸也曾延及到亚洲和中国，给中国和亚洲人民带来了灾难。在第二次世界大战前和战争期间，希特勒德国和军国主义日本曾经结成联盟，在欧洲和亚洲共同进行侵略战争。现在美国侵略集团所执行的整个侵略和战争计划，又是以武装西德和武装日本为重点。因此，今年七月二十五日中德两国总理会谈公报中曾指出，“反对重新武装西德和日本的斗争，成了所有爱好和平人民的共同任务”。中国人民反对美国侵略集团在亚洲武装日本，推行它的侵略和战争政策。中国人民为亚洲的和平和本国的安全而斗争。同时中国人民也反对美国侵略集团在欧洲武装西德，推行它的侵略和战争的政策，中国人民拥护为保障欧洲和平而作的斗争。目前为亚洲和平而斗争和为欧洲和平而斗争，是统一的、不可分割的共同斗争。
    中国人民正密切注视着欧洲局势的发展，坚决同苏联、各人民民主国家及其他爱好和平的国家和人民站在一起，誓以全力支持他们为欧洲集体安全和本国安全而进行的斗争，支持德国人民为和平统一而进行的斗争。以苏联为首的和平民主阵营各国所执行的和平政策以及为保卫和平所进行的共同斗争，是符合全世界一切国家人民的利益的，因此必然会得到各国人民的坚决拥护。我们为和平而斗争的事业是正义的，而正义的事业一定会获得胜利。
    这次莫斯科会议所讨论的问题，不仅对于欧洲安全，而且对全世界和平都有着极重大的意义。美、英、法和其他西欧国家的拒绝参加，更加证明了这次会议在维护和平、反对战争的事业中有着迫切的重要性。我谨代表中华人民共和国政府申明，中华人民共和国对苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫同志、波兰代表团团长西伦凯维兹同志、捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长西罗基同志、德意志民主共和国代表团团长格罗提渥同志以及其他在本会议上发言的代表同志们的声明表示完全同意，并将充分支持本会议就保障欧洲和平和安全所作出的决定和将采取的一切措施。我们相信，这次莫斯科会议一定能够顺利地完成摆在它面前的历史任务，进一步加强全世界保卫和平的力量。这次会议又一次表示出，和平民主阵营内的各国，对国际形势的各项问题的观点是完全一致的。和平民主阵营各国的这种团结和一致，是保卫欧洲和平、亚洲和平和全世界和平的不可战胜的巨大力量。现在，全世界人民要求和平。世界上没有任何力量能够阻止要求和平的人民力量的继续高涨和壮大。爱好和平的人民的力量是无敌的。胜利一定属于为和平而斗争的人民！
