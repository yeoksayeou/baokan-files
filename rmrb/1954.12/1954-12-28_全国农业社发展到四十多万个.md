Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: Since the beginning of winter, the broad masses of peasants in various regions have actively demanded the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. To date, most regions have completed more than half of their cooperative establishment plans for this winter and next spring. Currently, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide has increased from over 225,000 before the autumn harvest to over 400,000. Hebei and Shanxi provinces have basically completed their cooperative establishment plans and most areas have entered the stage of rectification and consolidation. The work of establishing cooperatives in Shandong, Henan, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang provinces is also progressing relatively quickly.

The enthusiasm of peasants in various regions for establishing cooperatives is generally high. Some peasants in Hebei Province said to working cadres: "Agricultural production cooperatives are good in direction, produce more, and have higher incomes, which is beneficial to both the country and the peasants. We want to actively participate." Peasants in Jintan County, Jiangsu Province, who newly joined agricultural production cooperatives, said to the members: "Even if you tie me up with ropes, I won't go back to working individually; even if you beat me with sticks, I won't leave the cooperative." In Leshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province, most year-round mutual aid teams are carrying out joint team activities, and some mutual aid joint teams are also learning the cooperative's management methods and implementing a small-scale contracting system. In Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, many mutual aid teams have established regular contact with nearby cooperatives, and some teams are even jointly carrying out basic land construction with the cooperatives. In some areas of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, mutual aid team leaders are carrying luggage and food and traveling dozens of miles to agricultural production cooperatives to learn cooperative management experience. In the process of the great development of cooperatives, many peasants have also joined "following the trend," and their thinking still shows varying degrees of wait-and-see and wavering attitudes.

The original agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have played a significant role in leading and helping peasants establish new cooperatives. The more than 500 agricultural production cooperatives in Nanping and Jianyang Prefectures in Fujian Province generally have three or four mutual aid teams and some individual peasants united around them, learning cooperative management from them. Laiyuan County in Hebei Province launched the work of "one cooperative leading two or three teams." Thirty-two old cooperative backbone members in the seventh district helped peasants establish 30 new cooperatives; 69 old cooperatives in Yi County assisted mutual aid teams in establishing 45 new cooperatives. In Huguan, Wuxiang, and other counties in Shanxi Province, old cooperatives helped new cooperatives solve many difficult problems within the cooperatives after their establishment, enabling the new cooperatives to quickly get on the right track. Numerous old cooperatives in Shaanxi, Jilin, Zhejiang, and other provinces not only demonstrated to the surrounding peasants with the facts of their own increased production, increased income, and continuous consolidation and improvement, but also adopted many effective methods to lead mutual aid teams and individual peasants to advance together. For example, they established regular meetings to exchange and disseminate experience, proactively signed contracts with teams to adjust labor, and enthusiastically united mutual aid teams and individual peasants to jointly build water conservancy and basic farmland construction. In addition, the cooperatives also paid attention to providing some peasants in difficulty with material and spiritual help and encouragement at any time, which greatly enhanced the prestige of the old cooperatives. However, there are also a few old cooperatives that have not fully demonstrated their economic stability and prosperity, making local peasants more trusting of agricultural production cooperatives.

In order to adapt to the great development of agricultural production cooperatives, local organizations of the Chinese Communist Party at all levels have extensively carried out socialist education and education on the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives to the peasants, trained cooperative management backbone members and cadres, and strengthened the core organization leading the establishment of cooperatives—the Chinese Communist Party's rural branch. This series of preparations has enabled the development of agricultural production cooperatives to basically advance under the policy of "active leadership and steady progress."

However, according to recent inspections in various regions, some problems still exist in the work of developing cooperatives. This is mainly manifested in the fact that many cadres lack serious investigation and research on the work of developing cooperatives, resulting in blind optimism and impetuousness. They believe that "under the general trend, the peasants' thinking is clear," "following the trend is voluntary," "mobilizing most peasants to join the cooperatives is no longer a problem," and so on. Under the guidance of this erroneous thinking, the plans for developing cooperatives are set too high and too large, and in the specific implementation, they disregard local actual conditions and whether the peasants are voluntary, blindly pursuing cooperativization. As a result, in some places, some people in newly established cooperatives have requested to withdraw from the cooperatives, or mutual aid teams have collapsed after the cooperatives were established, and it has had an adverse impact on agricultural production. Now, local organizations of the Chinese Communist Party at all levels are paying attention to solving this problem.

### 全国农业社发展到四十多万个

    全国农业社发展到四十多万个
    据新华社二十七日讯：入冬以来，各地广大农民积极要求建立农业生产合作社，到目前为止，绝大部分地区已完成今冬明春建社计划的一半以上。现在，全国的农业生产合作社已从秋收前的二十二万五千多个增加到四十多万个。河北、山西两省已经基本完成建社计划，大部分地区已转入整顿和巩固阶段。山东、河南、辽宁、黑龙江等省建社工作进展也较快。
    各地农民要求建社的热情一般是高的。河北省有些农民向工作干部说：“农业生产合作社是方向好，生产多，收入大，对国家对农民都有利，我们要积极参加。”江苏省金坛县新参加农业生产合作社的农民对社员说：“再叫我单干，绳扣我也不去；赶我出社，棒打我也不走。”四川省乐山专区的常年互助组大部分进行联组活动，部分互助联组还学习社的经营管理办法，推行了小包工制。山西省武乡县有许多互助组和附近的社建立了经常联系，有的组还和社共同进行土地基本建设。广东、广西两省的有些地方互助组组长背着行李、带着干粮到几十里以外的农业生产合作社去学习办社经验。在合作社大发展的过程中，也有许多农民是“随大流”进来的，思想上还表现不同程度的观望和动摇态度。
    各地原有的农业生产合作社，在带动和帮助农民建立新社中，起了极大的作用。福建省南平、建阳专区的五百多农业生产合作社，目前一般都有三、四个互助组和一些单干农民团结在它的周围，向它学习办社。河北省涞源县开展了“一社带动二、三组”的工作，第七区三十二个老社骨干分子，帮助农民建立了三十个新社；易县六十九个老社协助互助组建立了四十五个新社。山西省壶关、武乡等县由老社帮助新社解决了建社后社内存在的许多疑难问题，使新社迅速走上正轨。陕西、吉林、浙江等省许许多多的老社，不仅以本身的生产增加、收入增多和不断得到巩固提高的事实向周围农民示范，而且还采取许多有效的办法带动互助组和单干农民一道前进。如建立定期的碰头会来交流和传播经验，主动地和组订立互相调剂劳动力合同，热情地团结互助组和单干农民共同兴修水利、农田基本建设等等。此外，各社还随时注意给予某些有困难的农民在物质上和精神上的帮助与鼓励，这样就大大提高了老社的威信。但也有少数老社还没有充分显示出经济上的稳固与繁荣，使当地农民更加信任农业生产合作社。
    为了适应农业生产合作社的大发展，中共各级地方组织广泛地向农民开展了社会主义教育和农业生产合作社优越性的教育，训练了办社骨干分子和干部，健全和加强了领导建社的核心组织——中共农村支部。这一系列的准备工作使农业生产合作社的发展得以基本上在“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针下前进。
    但据各地最近的检查，发现发展社的工作还存在一些问题。这主要表现在不少干部对发展社的工作缺乏认真的调查研究，产生了盲目乐观和急躁情绪。他们认为“在大势所趋的情况下，农民的思想都通了”、“随大流就是自愿”、“发动大多数农民入社已不成问题”等等。在这种错误思想指导下，就使发展社的计划订的偏高偏大，加之在具体执行中不顾当地实际条件和农民是否自愿，盲目追求合作化，这样某些地方就发生了才建成的社中就有人要求退社或者办了合作社，垮了互助组的现象，并且对农业生产发生不利影响。现在中共各级地方组织正注意解决这一问题。
