    At the Broadcasting Station
    By Our Correspondent Lù Hào
    "Why are you always late getting off work?"
      "It's not time yet."
    "It's long past time! Your clock must be stopped!"
    Foreman Wang Lizhong said to Kuang Yongfu matter-of-factly, "The clock we're looking at can't be wrong. There are still ten minutes before quitting time."
    Kuang Yongfu, the foreman who had been waiting a long time to take over the shift, was hardly convinced. He said almost indignantly, "Many people's clocks say it's time. Only yours runs so special."
    It was really hard to figure out whose clock was right at that moment. Some were three minutes fast, some two minutes slow. One clock, one time. It was hard for anyone to say whose clock was definitely the most accurate.
    Finally, everyone agreed to check the clock of Zhao Xingyun, the announcer. They said, "Zhao's clock must be accurate, just like her broadcasts, always factual."
    At this moment, Zhao Xingyun was walking over. She was tall and slender, with two shiny black braids tied with purple-red woolen yarn at the ends. People could see her from far away.
    "Announcer, say something fair. What time is it really?" Everyone surrounded her, asking.
    Actually, Little Zhao's clock wasn't a standard clock accurate to the second either. However, because of people's trust in the broadcasting station, everyone was willing to let her decide. She looked at her watch and said, "It's two fifty-five in the afternoon now."
    Her words were so powerful that they immediately settled the difficult dispute. No matter how impatient the people going on shift were, they were willing to wait another five minutes after hearing her words. The people leaving shift said, "We'll definitely leave work when it's time, and guarantee not to work any longer."
    The broadcasting station, cherished and cared for by everyone, was located on the left bank of the Han River, in a small hut temporarily built with reed mats. On the side facing the construction site, there were two small glass windows, like two tireless eyes, always watching and encouraging the people building the Han River Bridge with passion and strength, day and night.
    On the day the pile driving for the No. 3 pier was about to end, Foreman Wang Lizhong suggested to everyone when they came to work in the morning: "Let's strive to drive three piles today and create a new record!" Zhao Xingyun, standing on the pier, heard about this and immediately ran back to the broadcasting station. Soon after, they heard her tell the entire construction site about their determination to set a new record.
    The comrades of Wang Lizhong's work team heard that their deed immediately spread throughout the construction site. They said, "The whole construction site is watching us. We can't let the announcer's good intentions down!"
    Those were the last days of winter, with rain and snow falling every day, and the Han River was bitterly cold. People wore raincoats and stood still, and a layer of transparent ice would condense on their raincoats after a while. The frozen nuts on the piles often had to be scalded with warm water before they could be removed...
    Normally, a shift of eight hours would only drive two and a half piles. Wang Lizhong's team overfulfilled their plan in six and a half hours today. Just as they had finished driving the third pile, in an instant, the news about their creating a new record was timely broadcast from the broadcasting station by Little Zhao.
    The underwater foundation work was carried out in bad weather with wind and rain for a considerable period. The constant rain flooded the entire construction site dormitory, and people woke up in their sleep to find small stools, washbasins, and shoes floating on the water. Most of Little Zhao's braid was also immersed in the water. Originally, others saw that she was a girl and, in order to take care of her, did not let her work the night shift, but she refused to agree. From the dormitory to the construction site, there was a long stretch of road where the water was higher than the knees. People stumbled in the water, like doing somersaults in the mud. From the embankment to the boat, one had to go through a high, steep slope, and sometimes Little Zhao would simply slide down like children on a slide. This night, the rain continued to fall. She and another comrade from the broadcasting station went to the No. 4 pier.
    Just as the two of them reached the bottom of the embankment, they saw two cooks from the mess hall carrying two buckets of thin porridge to deliver supper to the site. A basket full of steamed buns was hanging on the side of the porridge buckets. It was dark and slippery, and they were covered in water, walking with difficulty as they slipped.
    Little Zhao was very moved when she saw this. She said, "You're really working hard!"
    One of the older cooks shook his head, disagreeing with her. He pointed to the brightly lit No. 4 pier construction site and said, "We're nothing. They're the ones working hard."
    They went from one iron barge to another. In between, they had to walk across a section of gangplank several feet long on the rapid current of the Han River. The gangplank was very narrow and soft, and had no straw mats on it. It was very slippery, more difficult to walk on than a log bridge. The cooks had only taken a few steps when the buckets of thin porridge started shaking wildly. Little Zhao quickly followed behind them, using both hands to help hold the shaking porridge buckets, step by step, helping them across the gangplank.
    It was past midnight, and most of the people on the construction site, except for the comrades working the night shift, were already asleep. However, Little Zhao felt like she had a lot to say when she saw this situation. Thinking of this, she went back to the broadcasting station alone and told the night shift comrades about the cooks' difficult delivery of food.
    The entire construction site and mess hall were moved by Little Zhao's broadcast.
    She was sometimes seen at the construction site, and at other times her voice was heard speaking to the entire construction site from the broadcasting station. It was like this during the day, and also in the middle of the night. She became the workers' best friend. People would ask, "Where did Little Zhao go?" whenever they couldn't hear her voice for a while.
  "Why isn't Little Zhao broadcasting?"
    After Liu Jinxiang's team completed their pile-driving plan ten minutes before quitting time, they thought of the broadcasting station and immediately called Little Zhao, saying, "We've completed our plan ahead of schedule. Please broadcast it for us."
    Little Zhao agreed to them.
      "Please broadcast it right away. We're all waiting to hear you."
    As soon as Little Zhao finished broadcasting, she immediately came to the site of the No. 5 pier. She saw that the piles had already sunk, and there were more than ten minutes left before quitting time. Some workers were tying the hoisting cables, and some were threading the chain blocks. Little Zhao saw that they were preparing to insert a pile, preparing conditions for the next shift to drive the piles smoothly.
    Little Zhao saw the workers' thoughts and immediately ran back to the broadcasting station to introduce the matter to the entire construction site. The workers of Liu Jinxiang's team said after listening, "Little Zhao's eyes seem to be watching us all day long." They really did insert a pile before quitting time.
    The broadcasting station has become an indispensable partner in the daily lives of the workers.
    One evening, a crane operator walked into the small hut of the broadcasting station.
      "We have a request."
      "What request?"
      "I've written a manuscript for you."
      "You've written a manuscript for us?" The comrades of the broadcasting station asked strangely.
      "Yes, this manuscript is about you," the worker said. "Your work is too hard. You're broadcasting when we're working; we also hear you broadcasting when we're off work; when we lie down to sleep, we know you're still working. You're all doing it for us. Everyone wants me to thank you."
      "We should thank you. Without your labor, we wouldn't be able to do any work," the head of the broadcasting station said politely.
      "We also request to broadcast a manuscript ourselves."
    The broadcasting station certainly had no right to refuse such a request.
    He walked to the microphone in a few steps. It could be seen that his nervousness, because he was standing in such a place for the first time, made the white paper in his hand tremble a little. He was probably too excited, so these words sounded intermittent, and some were even repeated. But as long as anyone heard these words, they would know how much enthusiasm and praise they contained.
      "The comrades of the broadcasting station are very concerned... about us, and are very helpful... to us. Everyone wants to... learn from them... learn."
    The workers used such great honor to evaluate the work of the broadcasting station, which even Zhao Xingyun herself had never thought of.

    Ge Xian Designs New Locomotives for the Motherland
    Engineers from the Locomotive Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, under the guidance of Soviet experts, visited the "Л" type steam freight locomotive at the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition five times in order to provide design data for our country's new locomotives.
    The "Л" type locomotive was designed by the Soviet Union at the end of the Patriotic War to meet the needs of railway transportation after the war. It can not only save a large amount of non-ferrous metals, but also has a lighter axle load and greater traction force, and can run on general lines. The chief designer of the locomotive, Le S. Lebedyansky, and five designers were awarded the Stalin Prize. The design of the "Л" type locomotive fully reflects the socialist country's concern for people, and it has left an indelible impression on the minds of our engineers.
    What impressed the engineers the most was the driver's cab. Engineer Wang Zhongfu said: "Walking into the driver's cab is like being in a comfortable small living room. There are coat hooks, a small mirror, and the doors and windows are very tight." Stepping on a slightly sloping driver's ladder, one can see the smooth, clean floor of the driver's cab, and the leather sofa chairs for the driver and co-driver. Next to the chairs, there is an active leather cushion, which the fireman can sit on when it is placed down. The beige walls and the lights are very harmonious, allowing the crew to concentrate on looking ahead in a very comfortable manner. The locomotive has an automatic coal-feeding device. The fireman only needs to sit in the room and adjust the round handle of the five valves next to him to make the coal continuously shoot into the boiler from the five nozzles. This not only greatly saves manpower, but also enables the coal to burn completely in the fire chamber, burning evenly and cleanly. Engineer Pan Zuyou paid particular attention to the oil supply system of the "Л" type locomotive. He is in charge of thermal power, and although he has been working on railways for more than 20 years, he has never seen such a good automatic oiler. He crawled under the locomotive guide wheel to find the route of the twenty-four oil pipes. He found that with these two automatic oil pumps, even the smallest parts that are most easily neglected can be oiled. As soon as the train moves, the oil is automatically and evenly pressed to all parts. Automatic oil pressure can improve the quality of the friction parts of our locomotives, because manual oiling often causes wear and scratches on cylinders and steam chambers.
    Engineer Wang Zhongfu used to be a locomotive driver. He said: "In addition to driving, crew members have two other jobs: firing and oiling. Automation reduces people's labor and allows crew members to concentrate on looking ahead. Moreover, various operating devices in the room are very convenient. How can there be accidents!" He recalled: "A worker, standing on two cars (one foot on the locomotive and one foot on the tender), shoveling coal one shovel at a time, how strenuous that labor is!" He opened a book on railway transportation and calculated: "If one to one and a half tons of coal are thrown in per hour, then from Guye to Shanhaiguan on the busy Beijing-Shanhaiguan section, a round trip would require two people (fireman and co-driver) to throw about ten tons of coal, and filling the furnace with 10,000 kilograms of coal, including transporting and burning, would require 7,500 shovels!" He thought again: "Manual oiling is also very laborious. When arriving at a large station, the fireman or co-driver must get off the train and hurriedly touch here and there to check whether the moving wheels and axle boxes are hot, and then laboriously press the oil pump one by one." From this, he concluded: to regularize locomotive maintenance and repair work, the unreasonable oil supply situation must be changed.
    Every small part on the "Л" type locomotive aroused great interest among the engineers. Once, Engineer Wang Zhongfu, as if he had discovered a secret, crawled into the locomotive's water tank. He found a special device leading to the driver's cab. That is the instrument for measuring the water level. The crew members can sit in the room and know the depth of the water level in the rear water tank from this instrument. "This is truly a valuable improvement!" he thought. "Every time we arrive at a water supply station, the crew members have to climb to the top of the water tank and use a scale rod to insert into the water tank to measure the water. On cold days, the top of the car is frozen, and it is slippery and difficult to climb." Experienced drivers know this very well. The crew members have to climb from the coal car to the top of the water tank to measure the water before the locomotive arrives at the water supply station, that is, while the locomotive is still running. If they touch the electric wires while climbing, they risk hitting their heads and falling down.
    Technician Zhou Ruilin, who had been a driver for five years, carefully observed the "Л" type locomotive and said at a symposium: "A designer must not only have high technology, but also have advanced design ideas and always think about the workers. The locomotive should have all the conditions that facilitate the crew to operate. For example, it should have a tool room to allow crew members to repair parts in a timely manner; it should have a good obstacle remover device; the door of the driver's cab should open inward instead of outward; the indoor lighting should not be glaring to avoid affecting the driver's vision..."
      "The 'Л' type locomotive is an example for us to improve and manufacture locomotives in the future," was everyone's unanimous comment.

    在广播站
    本报记者　陆灏
    “你们怎么老不下班？”
      “还不到时间。”
    “老早到时间了，你们的表一定是停了！”
    工长王立中对匡永富理直气壮地说：“我们看的表，不会错，还有十分钟才到下班的时间。”
    等待接班很久的工长匡永富，哪里能服气。他几乎是愤激地说：“很多人的表都到时间了，就你们的表走得特别。”
    究竟是谁的表对，一时也实在弄不清。有的快三分，有的慢两分，一只表一个时间，谁也很难说谁的表一定最准确。
    最后，大家一致同意去看看广播员小赵的表。他们说：“小赵的表一定确实，就像她平常广播一样，从来都是实实在在的。”
    这时候，赵兴云正走过来，她颀长的个子，梳着两条黑亮黑亮的辫子，辫梢上系着紫红色的毛线。人们从老远的地方就看到她了。
    “广播员，你来说句公正话，现在实在是几点钟？”大家都围着她，问她。
    其实，小赵的表也并不是什么一分一秒不差的标准表。不过，由于人们对广播站的信赖，所以大家都愿意让她来作决定。她看了看表，说：“现在是下午两点五十五分。”
    她的话竟是这样有力地立刻平息了这场难解难分的争论。不管是上班的人等得怎样急躁，听了她的话，他们就心愿意服地再等五分钟。下班的人说：“我们到时间一定下班，保证不再工作就是了。”
    为大家爱护和关怀的广播站，坐落在汉水左边的堤岸上，那是用苇席临时搭成的一间小屋。在靠近现场这一面，开着两扇小玻璃窗，它像两只不疲倦的眼睛，永远带着热情和力量，朝朝夕夕地望着和鼓舞着建设汉水桥的人们。
    在三号桥墩的打桩工作快要结束的那一天，装吊工们一早上班的时候，工长王立中向大家提议说：“咱们今天争取打三根桩，创造一个新纪录！”站在桥墩上的赵兴云听到了这件事，她马上跑回广播站去，接着，就听见她把他们要创造新纪录的决心告诉了全工地。
    王立中工班的同志们听到了自己的事情立即在工地上传播开来。他们说：“全工地都在看着我们，我们可不能辜负广播员的一片好心啊！”
    那正是冬天最后的一些日子，天天雨雪纷飞，汉水上面冷气逼人。人们穿着雨衣，站着不动，只要一会儿，雨衣上就凝结了一层透明的薄冰。管桩上面冻了的螺丝帽，常常要用温水烫了以后才能把它卸下来……。
    平常一个班八小时只打两根半桩。王立中那个工班今天在六个半小时内就超额完成了自己的计划。当他们刚刚把第三根桩打完不久，一霎间，关于他们创造新纪录的消息，小赵已经又从广播站上及时地传出来了。
    水下基础工程有一段不短的时间是在风雨交加的坏天气里进行的。不停的雨把整个工地宿舍都泡在大水里，人们在睡梦中醒来，房间里的小凳、脸盆和鞋子都浮在水面上了，小赵的辫子也有大半根被浸在水里面。本来别人看她是个女孩子，为了照顾她，不让她上夜班，可是她那里肯答应。从宿舍到工地，有一长段路，水比膝盖还高，人在水里走路，一步一跤，像在烂泥里翻筋斗一样。从堤岸到船上去，要经过高高的陡坡，有时候小赵是像孩子们坐滑梯一样，干脆溜下去的。这一天夜里，雨仍是不停地下着。她和广播站另外一个同志到四号桥墩去。
    两人刚走到堤下，看见伙房里两个炊事员正挑了两桶稀粥给现场送夜饭去，稀粥的木桶边还挂着一篮满满的馒头，天黑，路滑，他们全身是水，一滑一滑地艰难地走着。
    小赵看到这情形，很受感动。她说：“你们真辛苦啊！”
    有一个年纪大一点的炊事员，他摇摇头，表示不同意她的意见。他指着灯火明亮的四号桥墩现场那边说：“我们算不了什么，他们才辛苦呢。”
    他们从这一只铁驳到那一只铁驳去，这中间，在汉水的急流上要走过一段几丈长的跳板。跳板很窄，且软，没有铺上草垫子，滑得厉害，比独木桥还难走，炊事员们刚走几步，挑着的稀粥桶直乱晃。小赵赶紧跟在他们后面，用两只手帮助拉住那乱晃的粥桶，一步一步地帮助他们走过了跳板。
    这是半夜过后，除了夜班的工作同志以外，工地上大多数人都已经睡了。可是，小赵看到这种情形，她觉得好像有很多话要说。她想到这里，就一个人走回广播站，把炊事员们艰难地送饭的情形告诉给夜班的同志们。
    整个工地和伙房，都被小赵的广播感动了。
    她总是一会儿出现在工地，一会儿又听到她在广播站上向全工地说话。白天是这样，半夜也是这样。她成了工人们最好的朋友，人们只要有一段时间听不见她的声音，就要问：“小赵到哪里去了？”
  “小赵怎么不广播？”
    刘进祥小组在下班以前十分钟完成了一天的打桩计划以后，他们想起了广播站，马上打电话给小赵说：“我们已经提前完成计划了，请你给我们广播广播吧。”
    小赵答应了他们。
      “请你马上广播。我们都等着听你的呢。”
    小赵一广播完，她马上就来到了五号桥墩的现场。她看到管桩已经下沉，离下班还有十几分钟，工人们有的在捆千斤，有的正穿葫芦；小赵看到他们正在准备插一根管桩，为下一班顺利打桩准备条件。
    小赵看出了工人们的心思，她马上又跑回广播站去，把这件事情向全工地作了介绍。刘进祥小组的工人们听了以后说：“小赵的眼睛，好像一天到晚在看着我们一样。”他们真的在下班以前插好了一根管桩。
    广播站成为工人们日常生活中不可缺少的伙伴了。
    在一个黄昏，有一位装吊工走进广播站的小屋子来。
      “我们有个要求。”
      “什么要求？”
      “我给你们写了一个稿子。”
      “是给我们写了一个稿子？”广播站的同志们奇怪地问。
      “是的，这个稿子上写的是关于你们的事情。”那位工人说：“你们的工作太辛苦了。我们在工作的时候，你们在广播；我们下班的时候，也听到你们广播；我们躺下睡觉了，知道你们还在工作。你们都是为了我们，大家要我来谢谢你们。”
      “应该谢谢你们。没有你们的劳动，我们是一点点工作也做不成的。”广播站的负责人客气地说。
      “我们还要求自己来播送一篇稿子。”
    广播站对于这样的事情，当然没有权利拒绝。
    他几步走到送话器的跟前，可以看得出来，由于他是第一次站在这样的地方，他的紧张的心情使得他手里拿的那张白纸有些颤动，他大约因为是过于兴奋，所以这些话听来是断断续续的，有的甚至是重复的。但只要任何人听到这些话，就会知道其中包含着多么巨大的热情的赞扬。
      “广播站的同志们，非常关心……我们，对我们……很有帮助。大家要……要向他们……学习学习。”
    工人们用这样大的荣誉来评价广播站的工作，这是连赵兴云自己也从来没有想到过的。为祖国设计新型的机车葛　娴
    铁道部机务局的工程师们，在苏联专家的指导下，五次参观了苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会上的“Л”型蒸汽货运机车，以便为我国的新机车提供设计资料。
    “Л”型机车是苏联在卫国战争末期，为适应战后铁路运输需要而设计的。它不仅可以节省大量有色金属，而且轴重较轻，牵引力大，在一般线路上均能运行。机车总设计师勒·斯·列别姜斯基和五位设计师曾获得斯大林奖金。“Л”型机车的设计，充分表现了社会主义国家对人的关怀，它在我国工程师们的思想上留下了不可磨灭的印象。
    最使工程师们注意和感到兴趣的是司机室。工程师王忠孚说：“走进司机室，就像到了舒适的小客厅，里边有挂衣钩、小镜子，门窗十分严密。”踏上一个微斜的司机梯，人们就可望见司机室内光滑干净的地板，司机和副司机的皮沙发椅子；在椅子的旁边，各有一块活动的皮垫，把它放下来，司炉就可以坐在上面。米黄色的墙壁，和灯光显得很调和，使乘务员能十分安逸地集中精力了望前方。机车上有着自动的投煤装置，司炉只要坐在室内，调整着身旁五个阀的圆把手，就可以使煤从五个喷嘴不断射进锅炉里去。这样，不但大大节约了人力，还能使煤在火室里全面燃烧；烧得既均匀，又干净。潘祖佑工程师特别仔细观察了“Л”型机车的给油系统。他是管热力的，虽然他做铁路工作已二十多年了，但是还没有见过这样好的自动加油机。他钻进机车导轮底，找寻二十四根油管来去的路线。他发现：用这两个自动压油机，连最易使人疏忽的细小部分都能加上油；车一走动，油就自动地、均匀地压向各处。自动压油，可以改善我们的机车磨擦部分的质量，因人工加油常发生汽缸、汽室磨耗和擦伤等现象。
    王忠孚工程师以前当过机车司机，他说：“乘务人员除开车外，还有两个活：一是烧火，二是给油。自动化减轻了人的劳动，使乘务员可以专心注视着前方，而且，室内各种操纵装置又极方便，那里还会出事故呢！”他回想：“一个工人，站在两个车上（一脚踏在机车上，一脚踏在煤水车上），一锹
  一锹地添煤，这是多么费力的劳动！”他翻开一本有关铁路运输的书籍，计算着：如果一小时投一吨到一吨半的煤，那么，从运输繁忙区段京山线的古冶到山海关，往返一次，两个人（司炉和副司机）就要投十吨左右的煤，一万公斤煤连传煤带填烧，要七千五百锹啊！”他又想道：“用人工加油，同样很费劲，一到大站，司炉或副司机就要下车，急忙摸这摸那，检查各个动轮和轴箱等处是不是发热，然后用油泵吃力地一下一下压。”由此他得出结论：要使机车保养和检修工作达到规律化，必须改变不合理的给油状况。
    “Л”型机车上面的每一个细小零件，都引起了工程师们的极大兴趣。有一次王忠孚工程师像发现了秘密似的，钻进机车的水柜里去。他发现有一个特殊装置通向司机室。那就是测量水位用的仪表。乘务员坐在室里，可以从这个仪表知道后面水柜里水位的深浅。“这真是一个可贵的改进！”他想。“我们每到一个给水站，乘务员就得爬到水柜顶上，用尺杆插在水柜里去量水。冷天车顶结冻，滑溜溜地爬都不好爬。”对于这，有经验的司机知道得很清楚，乘务员要在机车未到给水站之前，即机车还在运行时，就从煤车上面爬到水柜顶上去量水，如果在爬行时碰着电线，就有碰伤脑袋摔下去的危险。
    当过五年司机的技师周瑞林，仔细观察了“Л”型机车之后，在一次座谈会上说：“一个设计师，不但要有高度的技术，而且还要有先进的设计思想，处处为工人着想。机车内应该有便利乘务员操纵的一切条件。比如，它应该有工具室，让乘务员及时进行零件检修；应该有良好的排障器装置；司机室的门应该向里开而不应向外开；室内灯光不应刺眼，以免妨碍司机的视力……”
      “‘Л’型机车是我们今后改进和制造机车的范例。”是大家的一致评语。
