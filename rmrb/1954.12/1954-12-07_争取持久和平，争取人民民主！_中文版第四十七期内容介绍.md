The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, Issue 47, 1954, has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "Strive for European Collective Security, Consolidate the Cause of Peace." The editorial points out that the main issue of concern to the people of all European countries is the establishment of a European collective security system. Establishing such a system would maintain and consolidate peace and promote the solution of the most important post-war issue – the German question. The Soviet Union's new note to European countries regarding the convening of an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system puts forward specific measures to guarantee pan-European collective security. However, some powerful groups in Western countries, disregarding the people's firm demand for peace, continue to implement their policies of dividing Europe into opposing military blocs and reviving German militarism. The London and Paris Agreements pose a serious threat to the people of all European countries. Once these agreements are ratified, a new military bloc will emerge in Western Europe, a military bloc manipulated by West German revanchists and the most stubborn aggressors in the United States, which can only further complicate the current situation in Europe, inevitably worsen relations between European countries, trigger a more intense arms race, greatly increase the burden of military spending, and make it impossible to resolve Europe's outstanding issues, primarily the German question. The editorial emphasizes that: currently, an extremely broad movement has been launched in all European countries against the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements. A new stage in the struggle for European collective security and the consolidation of peace has begun, and the will of the people of all countries will surely be realized. The aggressive plans of American imperialists and their Western European partners must and will be shattered.

Important articles in this issue include "Opposition to the Rebuilding of the 'Bundeswehr' is a Vital Concern for the People of All European Countries" by Viliam Široký , Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic and Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Part of Czechoslovakia; "West German Arms Magnates and the Paris Agreement" by A. Norden; "Rural Political Work of the Polish United Workers' Party" by A. Alster, Member of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; and "National Education in New Romania" by I. Murgulescu, Minister of Education of the Romanian People's Republic, and others.

Široký's article first points out that the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an all-European conference is one of the most important events in the struggle for European collective security and the relaxation of international tensions. The article then discusses the threat posed by the Paris Agreements to peace in Europe and the world. The article states that the main purpose of the Paris Agreements is to further intensify tensions in Europe and the world, turn West Germany into a breeding ground for war and a base for aggression in Europe, in order to ultimately drag the people of all countries into another war. If the people of all European countries do not rise up and resolutely oppose these sinister plans, then a new West German "Bundeswehr" armed to the teeth will soon appear. The article says: The people of Czechoslovakia have long fully recognized the true face of German militarism and the criminal nature of this militarism. The government of the Czechoslovak Republic firmly declares that once the agreement on the re-militarization of West Germany is implemented, Czechoslovakia, together with its allies and friends, will take all necessary measures to consolidate and safeguard its own security. All European countries sincerely hope that German militarism will not be revived and that European security will be consolidated, so that the people of all European countries will not be destroyed in a struggle of mutual slaughter. The only correct path is to establish an effective European collective security system on the basis of guaranteeing mutual non-aggression and respecting the interests of all countries, large and small.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第四十七期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平、争取人民民主！”一九五四年第四十七期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“争取欧洲集体安全，巩固和平事业”为题发表了社论。社论指出，目前所有欧洲国家的人民都关心的主要问题就是建立欧洲集体安全体系问题。建立一个这样的体系就能保持并巩固和平，就能促进战后最重要的问题——德国问题的解决。苏联致欧洲各国的关于为讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题召开全欧会议的新照会，提出了保障全欧集体安全的具体办法。但是，西方国家的一些有势力的集团却不顾人民坚决要求和平的意志，继续执行自己的把欧洲分裂成对立的军事集团的政策和复活德国军国主义的政策。伦敦和巴黎协定对于所有欧洲国家的人民都是严重的威胁。这些协定一旦批准，西欧就会出现一个新的军事集团，一个由西德复仇主义分子和美国最顽固的侵略分子操纵的军事集团，就只能使欧洲目前局势更加复杂，就不可避免地会使欧洲国家之间的关系恶化，就会引起更激烈的军备竞争，大大加重军费的负担，使欧洲悬而未决的问题首先是德国问题不可能获得解决。社论强调说：现在，一切欧洲国家都已经展开了极其广泛的运动，反对批准伦敦和巴黎协定。争取欧洲集体安全和巩固和平事业的斗争的新阶段已经开始，各国人民的意志一定会实现。美国帝国主义者和他们的西欧伙伴的侵略计划必须而且一定能粉碎。
    这一期刊载的重要文章有捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理、捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会政治局委员威·西罗基的“反对重建‘国防军’是欧洲各国人民的切身事业”，艾·诺登的“西德军火大王和巴黎协定”，波兰统一工人党中央委员安·阿尔斯特的“波兰统一工人党的农村政治工作”和罗马尼亚人民共和国教育部部长伊·穆古莱斯库的“新罗马尼亚的国民教育”等。
    西罗基的文章首先指出苏联建议召开全欧会议是争取欧洲集体安全和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中最重要的事件之一。文章接着谈到了巴黎协定对欧洲和全世界和平的威胁。文章说，巴黎协定的主要目的是要再度加剧欧洲和全世界的紧张局势，把西德变成欧洲的战争温床和侵略基地，以便最后把各国人民拖进另一次战争。欧洲各国人民如果不奋起坚决反对这些罪恶计划，那么武装到牙齿的新的西德“国防军”很快就会出现了。文章说：捷克斯洛伐克人民早已充分认识德国军国主义的真正面目和这种军国主义的罪恶本质。捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府坚决地宣布：西德重新军国主义化的协定一旦实施，捷克斯洛伐克将同它的盟国和朋友联合采取一切必要的措施以巩固和保障本国的安全。所有欧洲国家都衷心希望不要让德国军国主义复活，希望巩固欧洲的安全，以免欧洲各国人民毁灭在彼此屠杀的斗争中。唯一正确的道路就是在大家保证互不侵略的基础上，在大小国家互相尊重彼此利益的基础上，来建立有效的欧洲集体安全体系。
