    The Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition held in Beijing is about to close today. During the nearly three-month exhibition period, nearly three million people visited, including people from various ethnic minorities thousands of miles away, commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army from afar, and representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. This enthusiastic situation fully demonstrates the enthusiasm of our people to learn from the Soviet Union and their longing for a socialist society. Facts show that the exhibition has achieved huge gains in three months.
    Our people have received a vivid socialist education from this exhibition. In the past few years, our government has sent dozens of delegations in industry, agriculture, culture, science and other fields to visit the Soviet Union for observation and learning; the Soviet government has also sent many delegations and experts to our country to specifically help with our construction. Thanks to their reports and introductions, our people have greatly improved their understanding of the great achievements of the Soviet people in economic and cultural construction and their happy and prosperous lives; however, seeing is believing, and people hope to personally see the achievements of Soviet economic and cultural construction. This exhibition has allowed millions of people to see, and after these millions of people spread it to the broad masses of the people, it will certainly further improve our people's understanding of the Soviet Union and further increase our people's confidence in building socialism.
    At the exhibition, people personally saw the great achievements of the Soviet people bravely struggling under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government. The Soviet people firmly implemented the policy of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and after more than 30 years of efforts, they have built their country into a leading industrial power in the world. The Soviet people have equipped agriculture with the latest machines, mechanized agricultural production, and turned many agricultural laborers into workers operating machines. After establishing and consolidating a strong heavy industry foundation, the light industry and food industry in the Soviet Union have also been greatly developed, enabling everyone to obtain increasingly abundant food, clothing, and various daily necessities. The Soviet people have mastered highly developed culture and science and enjoy an ever-improving material and cultural life. Seeing all this, and thinking of ourselves, we have a deeper understanding that the socialist road led by the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government is the only bright and correct road. A visitor from a minority ethnic group wrote in an inscription: "I must diligently and honestly learn from the Soviet big brother under the education of the Chinese Communist Party. I will dedicate my life to the national cause and build our Kangzang Plateau and Miao Mountains like the Ukrainian and Caucasus regions of the Soviet Union." This lofty mood and strong will are precisely the common mood and will of thousands of viewers.
    The Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition vividly introduced and imparted the advanced experience and science and technology of Soviet construction to our audience. This is urgently needed by our people who are entering the third year of the first five-year construction plan. How rich is the advanced experience and science and technology of the great Soviet Union presented to our audience! This exhibition has simply become a university for our various professional departments and audiences engaged in various tasks to learn specific Soviet experiences.
    Starting from the construction of the Soviet Exhibition Hall, our designers and construction workers, with the help of Soviet experts, learned advanced Soviet construction science. After the opening of the exhibition, the Soviet government sent experts from various fields to impart many advanced experiences and technologies to our audience during the exhibition, including rich content in industry, agriculture, culture, and art. The exhibition also received more than 1,000 questions from various places requesting answers. Soviet experts carefully studied these questions and adopted various methods such as on-site explanations, seminars, on-site guidance, writing letters, and sending instructions to meet the requirements of all parties. Many problems that production units had not solved for a long time have been successfully resolved due to this visit and study. For example, the employees of Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, Shenyang Air Compressor Factory, Dalian Refrigeration Factory, Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory and many other units, with the help of Soviet experts, solved many important problems existing in production. After visiting the Soviet "Л" type locomotive, the engineering and technical personnel of the Ministry of Railways gained great inspiration for the improvement of our locomotive repair and manufacturing work through seminars and discussions. Soviet experts also gave lectures to our engineering and technical personnel who participated in the exhibition; Soviet artists exchanged creative experiences with our art workers; the Soviet State Folk Dance Troupe and the Soviet State Moscow Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre came to our country to hold grand performances in conjunction with the exhibition, and exchanged experiences with our drama, music, and dance circles. These gains are very significant.
    The Soviet government and the Soviet people have given consistent and huge assistance to our country's construction undertakings in many aspects, and the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition has once again allowed the broad masses of our people to personally experience the selfless assistance of the Soviet people to our people. This also has a great effect on further consolidating and developing the close friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. In the year from the preparation to the completion of the exhibition, Soviet experts helped us build a magnificent exhibition hall; the Soviet government and the Soviet people selected more than 10,000 exquisite exhibits from all over the country, including various latest machines, excellent industrial and agricultural products, and the most precious Soviet artworks and paintings. The Soviet government sent more than 170 experts and staff to work for the exhibition and donated 83 machines from the exhibits to our government. The Chinese people sincerely thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their brotherly care and help to our people.
    Our people will make even greater efforts to consolidate and develop the unbreakable great friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and move forward more courageously on the road to socialism.

    三个月的巨大收获
    在北京举行的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会今天就要闭幕了。在这个展览会将近三个月的展览期间，参观的群众将近三百万人，其中有来自数千里以外的各少数民族的人民，有从远道来的人民解放军指挥员和战士，有来自朝鲜的人民志愿军代表。这种热烈的情况，充分表现了我国人民热心学习苏联和向往社会主义社会的心情。事实表明，这个展览会在三个月中的收获是巨大的。
    我国人民从这个展览会中受到了生动的社会主义教育。几年来，我国政府曾派遣了数十个工业、农业和文化科学等方面的代表团先后访问了苏联，进行了参观和学习；苏联政府也曾派遣了许多代表团和专家来我国，具体帮助了我国的建设。由于他们的报告和介绍，我国人民对于苏联人民在经济和文化建设方面的伟大成就和他们的幸福美好的生活的认识有了很大的提高；可是，百闻不如一见，人们都希望亲自看看苏联经济及文化建设的成就。这次展览会使几百万人看到了，经过这几百万人再传播到广大人民群众中去，就一定能够更加提高我国人民对于苏联的认识，更加提高我国人民建设社会主义的信心。
    在展览会中，人们亲眼看到了苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府领导下英勇奋斗的伟大成绩。苏联人民坚定地执行了国家工业化和农业集体化的方针，经过三十多年的努力，已经把自己的国家建设成了世界上头等的工业强国。苏联人民用最新式的机器装备了农业，使农业生产机械化了，许多农业劳动者变成了操纵机器的工人。苏联人民在确立和巩固了强大的重工业基础之后，轻工业和食品工业也已经得到很大的发展，使每人都可获得日益丰富的食品、衣着和各种日用品。苏联人民掌握了高度发展的文化科学，享受着日益提高的物质生活和文化生活。看到了这一切，联想到自己，人们也就更加深刻地体会到中国共产党和人民政府领导我们所走的社会主义道路是唯一光明正确的道路。一个少数民族的参观者在题词中写道：“我一定要在中国共产党的教育下，勤勤恳恳老老实实地向苏联老大哥学习。我将把毕生的精力献给民族事业，把我们的康藏高原、苗岭山地建设得像苏联的乌克兰和高加索一样。”这种崇高的心情，坚强的意志，正是千千万万的观众共同的心情和意志。
    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会生动地向我国观众介绍和传授了苏联建设的先进经验和科学技术。这是进入第一个五年建设计划的第三年度的我国人民所迫切需要的。摆在我国观众面前的伟大苏联的先进经验和科学技术是多么丰富啊！这个展览会简直成了我国各专业部门和从事各种工作的观众们学习苏联各项具体经验的一个大学校。
    从苏联展览馆的建筑开始，我国设计人员和施工人员，就在苏联专家的帮助下，学习了苏联先进的建筑科学。在展览会开幕以后，苏联政府又派来了各方面的专家，在展览期间向我国观众传授了许多先进的经验和技术，包括工业、农业、文化艺术等各方面的丰富内容。展览会还接到各地提出要求解答的问题一千多件，苏联专家们认真研究了这些问题，并采取了当场讲解、座谈、到现场实地指导、写信、寄说明书等各种方法满足了各方面的要求。许多生产单位长期没有解决的问题，由于这次的参观和学习得到了圆满的解决。如北京市第一机床厂、沈阳风动工具厂、沈阳空气压缩机厂、大连冷冻机厂、北京农业机械厂等许多单位的职工，都在苏联专家帮助之下，解决了生产中存在的不少重要问题。铁道部工程技术人员参观苏联“Л”型机车以后，经过座谈和讨论，对我国机车修造工作的改进得到了很大的启发。苏联专家还给参加展览会工作的我国工程技术人员讲课；苏联美术家和我国美术工作者交流了创作经验；苏联国立民间舞蹈团、苏联国立莫斯科斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基与聂米罗维奇—丹钦科音乐剧院配合展览会来我国举行了盛大的演出，同我国戏剧、音乐、舞蹈界交流了经验。这些收获是十分重大的。
    苏联政府和苏联人民对我国的建设事业给了多方面的一贯的巨大援助，而苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会，又使我国广大人民群众再一次亲身体验到了苏联人民对我国人民的无私援助。这对于进一步巩固和发展中苏两国人民的亲密友谊也有很大作用。展览会从筹备到完成的一年间，苏联专家帮助我们建筑了宏伟的展览馆；苏联政府和苏联人民从全国选择了一万多件精美的展览品，其中有各种最新式的机器，有工、农业优良的产品，有最珍贵的苏联艺术品和绘画。苏联政府派了一百七十多位专家和工作人员来担任展览会的工作，并且把展览品中八十三项机器赠送给我国政府。中国人民衷心感谢苏联政府和苏联人民对我国人民这种兄弟般的关切和帮助。
    我国人民将更加百倍努力来巩固和发展中苏两国牢不可破的伟大友谊，更加奋勇地在社会主义的道路上迈进。
