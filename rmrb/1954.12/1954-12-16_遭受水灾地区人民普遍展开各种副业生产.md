Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: People in areas that suffered from floods this year have universally launched diverse sideline production activities, and many areas have achieved significant results.

In areas along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, the People's Government has organized large numbers of disaster victims to engage in fishing. People on both sides of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers in Anhui Province are expected to catch 240 million catties of fish within three months, which can generate an income of over 178 billion yuan. In the Xiaogan Special District of Hubei Province, state purchasing stations have already purchased over 12 million catties of fresh fish from disaster victims. In some flood-affected areas of the Tianjin and Baoding Special Districts in Hebei Province, disaster victims are currently engaged in over 60 types of sideline production activities. Since launching sideline production, some disaster-stricken counties in the Baoding Special District have earned 50.7 billion yuan. In some disaster-stricken counties along the Huai River in Henan Province, many disaster victims have used income from sideline production to purchase grain, making up for the grain shortage.

The People's Governments in disaster-stricken areas have vigorously led and assisted the production of disaster victims. Anhui Province established a sideline production committee early on to guide sideline production in disaster areas. Hebei, Henan, and other provinces have held work conferences on production and disaster relief to deploy sideline production work in disaster areas. To help disaster victims solve production and living difficulties, Hunan Province issued over 340 billion yuan in relief funds and 126.2 billion yuan in loans. As of the end of October, Hebei Province had allocated over 100 billion yuan in loans. Jiangsu Province issued 24 billion yuan in relief funds. Economic departments in various localities actively purchased products from disaster victims. The Anhui Provincial Aquatic Products Company and supply and marketing cooperatives have added 168 fish product purchasing stations in areas along the Yangtze River and near lakes. Some disaster-stricken counties in Hebei Province have also sent cadres carrying sideline samples to major cities to find sales channels. Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Hebei, and other provinces have sent a large number of cadres deep into disaster areas to help disaster victims engage in sideline production. Cadres sent to Henan and Hunan Provinces have also helped disaster victims organize various sideline production groups, and some have also taught production techniques to disaster victims.

In developing sideline production in disaster areas, the method of using mutual aid and cooperation as the center to drive individual farmers has been universally adopted, yielding great results. Gaochun County in Jiangsu Province, close to Danyang Lake, has driven a large number of individual farmers to participate in sideline production by reorganizing ten agricultural production cooperatives and 530 mutual aid teams in disaster areas, and has newly established 32 agricultural production cooperatives and a large number of mutual aid teams. Disaster victims organized by three townships in Quantang District of Wuwei County, Anhui Province, have solved the problem of insufficient fishing tools through mutual assistance and coordination between groups, and have added 11 small boats and 1,500 grappling hooks with government loans. In some disaster-stricken counties in Henan Province, in addition to conducting propaganda and education on the policy of production and disaster relief among disaster victims, meetings of heads of mutual aid and cooperation organizations were held. By finding solutions and calculating detailed accounts, the enthusiasm of cooperative and team leaders for production and self-salvation was greatly encouraged, and the formulation of production plans by each cooperative and team was promoted.

    遭受水灾地区人民普遍展开各种副业生产
    【新华社十五日讯】今年遭受水灾地区的人民，普遍开展了多种多样的副业生产，不少地区已获得了显著成效。
    江、湖沿岸地区，人民政府组织了大批灾民进行捕鱼。安徽省长江、淮河两岸人民预计三个月内可捕鱼二亿四千万斤，约可收入一千七百八十多亿元。湖北省孝感专区，国家的收购站已向灾民收购了一千二百多万斤鲜鱼。河北省天津和保定专区的部分曾遭水灾的地区，目前灾民从事的副业生产达六十多种，保定专区某些受灾县份自开展副业生产以来，已收入五百零七亿元。河南省沿淮地区某些受灾县，有不少灾民用副业收入购买了粮食，弥补了粮食不足的情况。
    受灾地区人民政府大力领导和帮助了灾民的生产。安徽省很早就成立了副业生产委员会，指导灾区副业生产。河北、河南等省都曾召开生产救灾工作会议，布置灾区副业生产工作。为帮助灾民解决生产和生活困难，湖南省发放救济款三千四百多亿元、贷款一千二百六十二亿元；河北省截止十月底已拨发贷款一千亿多元；江苏省发放救济款二百四十亿元。各地经济部门积极收购灾民的产品，安徽省水产公司和供销合作部门，在沿江滨湖地区增设了一百六十八个渔产收购站；河北省有些受灾县份还派出干部携带副业样品赴大城市找寻销路。安徽、湖北、湖南、河北等省都派出大批干部，深入灾区，帮助灾民进行副业生产；河南省和湖南省下去的干部还分别帮助灾民组织各种副业生产小组，有的还向灾民传授生产技术。
    灾区在开展副业生产中，普遍采取了以互助合作为中心带动单干农民的办法，收效很大。江苏省紧靠丹阳湖滨的高淳县，从整顿灾区十个农业生产合作社、五百三十个互助组中，带动了大批单干农民参加副业生产，并新建了三十二个农业生产合作社和大量的互助组。安徽省无为县泉塘区三个乡组织起来的灾民，通过组与组的互助调剂，解决了捕鱼工具不足的困难，并用政府贷款添置了小船十一只、卡钩一千五百只。河南省有些受灾县，除了在灾民中进行生产救灾方针政策的宣传教育外，并召开互助合作组织负责人会议，通过找门路、算细账，大大地鼓舞了社长、组长生产自救的情绪，推动了各个社、组都制订了生产计划。
