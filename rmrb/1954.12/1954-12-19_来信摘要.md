Letter Excerpts

Good Care Should Be Taken of Farm Tools
	Hao Zhenjiang of the Qiqihar Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry in Heilongjiang writes: Last month, we focused on checking the farm tool storage situation in the Gonghe Village of the Dahuodian District and found that some mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives were doing a very poor job of storing farm tools. For example, the Qianjin Cooperative left their farm tools in the courtyard after use, some of the tools had already fallen apart, and parts were missing. Although the farm tools of the Jilin Cooperative had been put away in the house, the bearings of the disc harrows had not been cleaned, some of the tools that should have been oiled had not been oiled, and some of the tools that should have been padded were not padded. It is understood that this situation also exists in other districts and villages. Some people put farm tools in pig, sheep, and livestock pens, burying half of them in manure, and the tools were covered with old red rust; some people used seed boxes of seeders as horse troughs or chicken nests; and some people used nail-tooth harrows to block pigsty doors or used other farm tools as stakes for tethering livestock. If attention is not paid to this problem, the phenomenon of "sharpening spears at the last minute" and "being caught unprepared" will occur during the spring ploughing next year. Therefore, I hope that the relevant departments of local governments will conduct an inspection of the farm tool storage situation and promptly educate agricultural cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers to pay attention to improving farm tool storage work.

Attention to Cold-Proof Packaging of Medicines
	Readers Xie Guixiang and Wang Zhaoxiang write: The Qiqihar Warehouse of the Heilongjiang Provincial Pharmaceutical Company has found that the phenomenon of frozen medicines is very serious when accepting goods from various pharmaceutical units. On November 25th, 34 pieces of injectable medicine sent by the Liaoxi Veterinary Hospital Pharmaceutical Room were all frozen. After being melted in storage, it was found that the injection had deteriorated. On November 30th, 500 bottles of mercurochrome sent by the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Purchasing and Supply Station by "slow mail" were all frozen due to poor packaging, and more than 30 bottles had even cracked. On December 5th, we received 53 pieces of medicine sent by the Sujiatun Warehouse of the Shenyang Pharmaceutical Purchasing and Supply Station. After inspection, it was found that some of the medicines were frozen. In addition, medicines sent to us by the Liaodong Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory and other units were also damaged.
	Since the beginning of winter this year, the China Pharmaceutical Company has repeatedly instructed all localities to pay attention to the cold-proof packaging of medicines, but some pharmaceutical units still have not paid attention to it, especially some units have not strengthened the packaging of medicines according to the different climate conditions in various places. We hope that pharmaceutical units in all localities will pay attention to improving this work.

Do Not Distribute New Year Pictures Unsuitable for Forest Areas to Forest Areas
	Gong Shichang of the Forest Fire Prevention Headquarters in Muling County, Heilongjiang Province, writes: Our province is one of the major forest areas in the country. In order to strictly prevent forest fires, the government has repeatedly issued orders for forest protection and fire prevention, repeatedly emphasizing that all sources of fire and open-air fire activities should be eliminated. However, some New Year pictures and other propaganda posters like to draw an old farmer with a smoking pipe, puffing out wisps of smoke, regardless of the occasion. The distribution units do not consider the regional situation and send them to the forest area, which is not in line with the lives of people in the forest area who are required to pay attention to fire prevention and forest protection at all times. I request that the New Year picture distribution agencies not distribute such paintings to forest areas.

Transportation Departments Should Save Cloth Used for Making "Freight Tags"
	Reader Xu Shulin writes: At present, some transportation departments use cloth-printed labels (commonly known as freight tags) to identify goods when handling freight, and some units use very good quality cloth for the freight tags. If each freight tag requires six square inches of cloth, and each piece of goods hangs two freight tags, then 10,000 pieces of goods will require 12,000 square feet of cloth. If the amount of cloth used by transportation units across the country to make freight tags is added up, the quantity is very alarming. This not only wastes cotton cloth but also increases transportation costs. It is recommended that transportation units pay attention to this issue and consider changing the cloth freight tags to paper ones when transporting goods.

Is It Boasting About Achievements or Supporting Workers' Creativity?
Editor:
	In September, at the Vehicle Hall of the Advanced Workers' Representative Conference Exhibition of the Jilin Railway Bureau, there was a "multi-head screw lathe" on display. The commentator kept explaining to the visitors: "This was created by veteran worker Wang En'gui and others from the Jilin Vehicle Section. In the past, a lathe could only turn one screw rod at a time, but now it can turn eight at a time."
	The railway workers in the Jilin area are already quite familiar with this lathe. Since February of this year, the general party branch and trade union of the Jilin Vehicle Section have constantly mentioned it in summaries, briefings, and special reports. Later, the Jilin Railway Regional Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Organization Section of the Political Department of the Jilin Railway Transportation Bureau, and the Jilin Partition Committee of the China Railway Trade Union also talked about this matter when reporting to higher authorities. From April to the end of July, this lathe was exhibited at the Technical Innovation Exhibition held by the Jilin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. When Jilin Province convened a conference of advanced producers, a material from the Vehicle Section vividly described: "The 'multi-head screw lathe' created by Wang En'gui and others has basically succeeded. Lathe operator Liu Fengming skillfully operates it, and many people gather around to watch the lathe that can thread eight screws at a time. Wang En'gui touches his beloved machine. Engineers Jiang Zhenyu and Chang Jingchen talk next to the lathe: In the past, a threading lathe could only thread one screw at a time, but unexpectedly, it can now thread eight at a time..."
	This lathe must have played a huge role in production, right? No, the fact is not like that. Please see the "internal situation":
	Veteran worker Wang En'gui of the Vehicle Section proposed the idea of manufacturing a "multi-head screw lathe." At the beginning of January this year, the section accepted this suggestion and assigned two fitters to help with the trial production. Especially in March, in order to participate in the exhibition, the trial production work was intensified. The mechanical room regarded this as the main work, and three or four lathe operators worked overtime to help. By the end of March, the "multi-head screw lathe" was produced. The test results showed that eight screws were turned at a time, of which three were defective—that is to say, initial achievements have been made, but further improvements are needed before it can be applied to production.
	The multi-head screw lathe was placed in the exhibition hall, with eight high-quality screws installed on the threading dies. The leading cadres of the Vehicle Section were busy publicizing their achievements, but they forgot that they also had the responsibility to help Wang En'gui improve the lathe and realize this creation. In early June, the Dashitou Forestry Bureau sent six cadres, including engineers, to the Jilin Vehicle Section to learn how to manufacture the lathe. The leading cadres of the Vehicle Section hesitated for a long time and said awkwardly: "It has not been successful yet, it is only on display now." However, until September, the Vehicle Department of the Jilin Railway Bureau still sent this unsuccessful "multi-head screw lathe" as the second exhibit and wrote a material saying: "The multi-head screw lathe has been successfully manufactured, solving the key problem of the supply of screw bolts falling short of demand and ensuring the needs of passenger and freight car maintenance parts."
	At the end of October, the "multi-head screw lathe" returned. But until now, the work of continuing the experiment has not yet started. People want to ask: Is the approach of the Vehicle Department of the Jilin Railway Bureau and the Jilin Vehicle Section boasting about achievements or truly supporting the creativity of the working masses?

专栏：来信摘要

    来信摘要
    农具应该保管好
    黑龙江齐齐哈尔市农林局郝振江来信：上个月我们重点检查了达胡店区共和村的农具保管情况，发现有些互助组和农业生产合作社农具保管工作做得很差。比如前进社在用完农具以后一直放在外面院子里，有的农具已经散开了，零件也丢失了。纪林社的农具虽然已经收拾在屋里，但圆盘耙的轴承没有洗，有的农具该抹油的地方也没有抹油，该垫一些东西的没有垫。这种情况，据了解在别的区、村也有。有的把农具放在猪、羊、牲口圈里，埋了半截粪尿，农具上都生了老红锈；有的把播种机种籽箱做马槽子或母鸡下蛋的窝；有的用钉齿耙挡猪圈门或用其他农具做拴牲口的桩子。这个问题如不引起注意，明年春耕时就会发生“临阵磨枪”
  “措手不及”的现象。因此，我希望各地政府有关部门对农具保管情况作一次检查，并及时教育各农业社、互助组以及个体农民，注意改进农具保管工作。
    注意药品的防寒包装
    读者谢贵祥、王肇祥来信：黑龙江省医药公司齐齐哈尔仓库在接受各地医药单位的进货中，发现药品冻坏的现象十分严重。十一月二十五日，辽西兽医院制药室发来三十四件注射药全部冻了，经入库溶化后发现注射液变了质。十一月三十日，天津医药采购供应站用“慢件”发来的红汞水五百瓶，由于包装不善都冻坏了，并且有三十多瓶连瓶子都已经冻裂了。十二月五日，我们收到沈阳医药采购供应站苏家屯仓库发来的五十三件药品，经检查发现部分药品有冻坏的现象。此外，辽东化学制药厂以及其他单位寄发给我们的药品也有损坏的现象。
    今年入冬以来，中国医药公司就一再指示各地重视药品的防寒包装工作，但是至今仍有一些医药单位没有引起重视，特别是有的单位没有根据各地气候不同的情况，加强药品的包装工作。我们希望各地医药单位注意改进这一工作。
    不要把不适宜于林区的年画发行到林区去
    黑龙江省穆稜县护林防火指挥部宫世昌来信：我省是全国主要林区之一。政府为了严防森林火灾，曾不断发出护林防火命令，一再强调应杜绝一切火源和野外弄火行为。但是有些年画及其他宣传画刊上却不分什么场合都是喜欢画一个老年农民衔着烟袋，冒着缕缕青烟。而发行单位也不考虑地区情况，就送到林区去，这和要求林区人民时刻注意防火护林的生活是不相符的。我要求发行年画机关不要把这类的画发行到林区去。
    运输部门应该节约制“飞子”用的布
    读者徐舒林来信：目前某些运输部门办理运货时，用来识别货物的标签（俗称飞子）是用布印制的，有些单位所用飞子的布质很好。如果每张飞子需六方寸布，每一件货挂两个飞子，一万件货就要用一万二千方尺布。如果把全国各运输单位用在做飞子的布加起来，数量是很惊人的。这不但浪费了棉布，而且也增加了运输成本。建议各运输单位注意这一问题，考虑把运货时的布飞子改成纸制的。
    是吹嘘成绩，还是支持工人的创造编辑同志：
    九月间，在吉林铁路管理局先进工作者代表大会展览会车辆馆里，摆着一台“多头螺丝床子”。解说员不断向参观的人们说明：“这是吉林车辆段老工人王恩贵等人创造的，过去一台床子每回只能镟一根螺丝杆，现在一回能镟八根。”
    对于这台床子，吉林地区的铁路职工们已经相当熟悉了。从今年二月起，吉林车辆段的党总支和工会在总结、简报、专题报告里都不断提到它。以后，中共吉林铁路地区委员会、吉林铁路运输分局政治处组织科和中国铁路工会吉林分区委员会向上级机关报告时也谈到了这件事。从四月份到七月末，这台床子曾经在吉林市总工会举办的技术革新展览会上展出。吉林省召开先进生产者会议时，车辆段的一份材料里面生动地描述道：“王恩贵等人创造的‘多头螺丝床子’已经基本成功，镟工刘凤鸣熟练地操纵着它，许多人都欢欣地围拢来，看这台一次能套八个螺丝的床子。王恩贵手摸着心爱的机器。姜镇宇、常竞忱工程师在床子旁边谈论：从来套丝床一回只能套一个螺丝，想不到一回能套八个了……。”
    这台床子一定已经在生产中发挥了巨大的作用了吧！不，事实却不是这样。请看“内部情况”：
    车辆段老工人王恩贵提出了制造“多头螺丝床子”的建议。今年一月初，段上接受了这个建议，抽出两名钳工来帮助试制。特别是三月份，为了参加展览会，试制工作更加紧了。机械室把这当成主要工作，三、四名镟工加班加点帮助干。到三月末，“多头螺丝床子”制出来了。试验结果，一次镟出八个螺丝，其中有三个是废品——这就是说，初步成绩已经有了，但是还需要作进一步的改进，才能运用到生产中去。
    多头螺丝床子放在展览会的会场里，钣牙上安着八个头等质量的好螺丝。车辆段的领导干部忙着宣传自己的成绩，但是忘记了他们还有责任帮助王恩贵改进床子，实现这个创造。六月初，大石头森林工业局派了工程师等六个干部到吉林车辆段来学习制造床子的办法，车辆段领导干部支吾了半天，尴尬地说：“还没有成功哩，现在只是展览。”但是，直到九月份，吉林铁路管理局车辆处仍然把这台还没有成功的“多头螺丝床子”送去作第二次展品，并且写了一个材料说：“多头螺丝床子制造成功，解决了螺丝栓供不应求的关键问题，保证了客货车检修配件的需要。”
    十月末，这台“多头螺丝床子”回来了。但是直到现在，继续试验的工作还没有动手做。人们要问：吉林铁路管理局车辆处和吉林车辆段的这种做法，是吹嘘成绩呢，还是真正支持工人群众的创造？
