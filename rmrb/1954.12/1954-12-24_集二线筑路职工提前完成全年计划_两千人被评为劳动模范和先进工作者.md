Xinhua News Agency, Jining, December 23rd: The workers of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who are constructing the Jining-Erlian railway line, have completed the 1954 national plan ten days ahead of schedule, and have saved the country 25.2 billion yuan.

The quality of all the main projects completed this year is higher than last year, basically meeting the construction standards. Materials such as sand, stone, water, cement, bricks, and ballast used in the main projects have all been tested in advance. The foundation works have also been load-tested. In terms of roadbed construction, the advanced experience of overall construction and planned soil extraction recommended by Soviet experts was adopted, making the roadbed drainage smooth, tidy and aesthetically pleasing.

Xinhua News Agency, Jining, December 23rd: Among the railway workers constructing the Jining-Erlian railway line, one hundred and thirty-seven were named labor models of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways this year, and more than one thousand eight hundred were named advanced workers. Ding Wanchen, a national railway labor model, was awarded the "Glorious Railway Worker" medal by the Ministry of Railways.

The Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways accepted the suggestions of labor model Ding Wanchen to eliminate temporary bridges and temporary lines, saving the country a total of more than 2 billion yuan in funds. The Second Engineering Section led by Ding Wanchen has overfulfilled all the roadbed earthwork, bridge, culvert, and building construction tasks assigned to it this year. Jia Xin, a first-class labor model of the Third Engineering Bureau, created wooden rollers for bending water pipes and rebars when doing reinforced concrete work, increasing efficiency six times; he also improved the tool for cutting rebars. During winter construction, the hammering team led by Tang Xuelong, an advanced worker of the track-laying team, came up with a method of shortening hammer handles and hammering with the wind, and 95 percent of the spikes they drove were qualified. Li Guangsheng, a tractor driver in the mechanized road construction team, took off his leather coat and covered the water tank in the severe cold of minus thirty degrees in order to quickly troubleshoot the tractor.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 23rd: The bridge-laying project of the Bawang River Bridge, the largest bridge on the Jining to Ulan Bator railway's Jining to Erlian section, was completed on the 23rd. From now on, trains departing from Jining will pass directly through this bridge to Erlian.

A bridge with national style, the whole bridge is more than 130 meters long and 27 meters high. The bridge piers are made of basalt.

In the past few days of bridge-laying, many Mongolian and Han farmers came from afar to visit. When the bridge workers steadily placed the last 50-ton steel beam on the magnificent piers, the bridge project was finally completed, and then the workers slowly left the huge crane and sang "We Workers Have Strength..." joyfully along with the whistle. Construction on the Bawang River Bridge began in March this year. In the past ten months, the workers have overcome severe cold, defeated floods, and completed the entire project on schedule.

    集二线筑路职工提前完成全年计划
    两千人被评为劳动模范和先进工作者
    【新华社集宁二十三日电】修建集宁二连线的铁道部第三工程局职工，已提前十天完成了一九五四年的国家计划，并且为国家节约了二百五十二亿元的财富。
    今年已完成的各项主体工程的质量都比去年高，基本上达到了施工标准。主要工程所用的沙、石、水、水泥、砖、石碴等材料，都事先经过试验。基础工程也作了载重试验。在路基修建方面，采用了苏联专家建议的整体施工、计划取土的先进经验，使路基排水畅通而且整齐美观。
    【新华社集宁二十三日电】修建集宁二连线的铁路职工，有一百三十七人今年被评为铁道部第三工程局劳动模范，有一千八百多人被评为先进工作者。全国铁路劳动模范丁万臣，荣获铁道部颁发的“光荣的铁路工作者”奖章。
    铁道部第三工程局接受劳动模范丁万臣的取消便桥和便线等建议，共为国家节约资金二十多亿元。丁万臣所领导的第二工程段，今年担负的路基土石方工程和桥涵、房屋等建筑全部超额完成。第三工程局甲等劳动模范贾信，在做钢筋混凝土工程的时候，创造弯水管和弯钢筋用的木质滚子，使效率提高六倍；他还改进了裁钢筋的工具。在冬季施工中，钉道队先进工作者唐学龙领导的打锤班，想出缩短锤柄、顺风打锤的办法，打下的道钉有百分之九十五合格。机械筑路队拖拉机驾驶员李广生，为了迅速排除拖拉机的故障，在零下三十多度的严寒中，把自己的皮大衣脱下来盖在水箱上。
   【新华社呼和浩特二十三日电】集宁至乌兰巴托铁路的集宁到二连段最大的一座桥梁——坝王河桥架梁工程，在二十三日全部竣工。至此，由集宁开出的列车将通过这座大桥直达二连。
    一座具有民族风格的大桥，全桥长一百三十多公尺，高二十七公尺。桥墩是用悬武岩石砌成的。
    在架梁的这几天，有很多蒙族和汉族的农民远道赶来参观。当架桥工人们把五十吨的最后一架钢梁平稳地放在雄伟的桥墩上以后，这座大桥工程就最后完成了，随后工人们徐徐离开了巨大的吊车，随同汽笛声欢乐地唱起了“咱们工人有力量……”。坝王河桥从今年三月开工，十个月来，工人们克服了严寒，战胜了洪水，全部工程按预定时间完成。
