To all commanders and fighters, workers, laborers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Tibetan compatriots participating in supporting transportation who built the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet Highways:

    The Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet Highways are simultaneously open to Lhasa today. This great joyous event that the Tibetan people have dreamed of for generations has been realized today under the wise leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao.

    As we celebrate the opening of these two highways to Lhasa with unparalleled joy, we clearly see the bright future of the Tibetan people; we also deeply know that these two highways are not just ordinary highways, but the avenue to prosperity and happiness for our Tibetan people. In countless years to come, suffering and backwardness will never again accompany our lives. Therefore, we also deeply feel that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the guiding lights for us. In the warm family of the motherland with friendly cooperation, they are the reliable guarantee for the development and progress of our ethnic minorities.

    We also clearly see that these two roads are the crystallization of the blood and sweat of thousands upon thousands of people, and the result of the close unity of all ethnic groups. In the nearly five years of construction, you have endured the cold and risked your lives in high mountains, on cliffs, in rushing rivers, on the vast uninhabited grasslands, and on snowy mountains covered with ice and snow, fighting day and night with glaciers, quicksand, sinking ground, and rocks. The world's famous high mountains and great rivers have all been conquered by your working hands and tenacious will. You have made immortal contributions to the motherland and the Tibetan people, and created an unprecedented miracle in the history of world highway construction. Your glory will not only be passed down in the eternal memory of our Tibetan people, but will also be praised and celebrated by the people of the whole country!

    On this day of celebrating the opening of the highways to Lhasa, we would like to express to the people of the whole country: Under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the State Council of the People's Republic of China, we will further strengthen and consolidate the unity between and within ethnic groups, and work together to build our great motherland and a prosperous and happy new Tibet!

    Please accept our cordial greetings and highest respect!

    Eternal glory to the martyrs who gloriously sacrificed themselves in the construction of the highways!

    给全体筑路人员的慰问信修筑康藏公路和青藏公路的中国人民解放军全体指战员、全体职工、民工和参加支援运输工作的西藏同胞们：
    康藏、青藏两条公路今天同时通车拉萨了。我们西藏人民世世代代梦想着的一件大喜事，今天在伟大的中国共产党、毛主席的英明领导下实现了。
    在我们以无比愉快的心情庆祝这两条公路通车拉萨的时候，我们清楚地看到了西藏人民幸福的前景；我们也深深知道，这两条公路，不仅是一般的公路，而是我们西藏民族走向繁荣幸福的大道。在今后无数年代中，苦难和落后将永远不再伴随着我们的生活，因此我们也深深感到共产党、毛主席是我们照路的明灯，在友好合作的温暖的祖国大家庭中，是我们少数民族发展进步的可靠保证。
    我们也清楚地看到，这两条道路，是千千万万人的血汗的结晶，是各族人民亲密团结的成果。在近五年的修筑过程中，你们在崇山峻岭中，在悬崖峭壁上，在湍急的河流里，在荒无人烟的辽阔草原上，在冰天雪地的雪山上，忍受着寒冷、冒着生命危险，日日夜夜地和冰川、流沙、陷地、岩石搏斗，世界有名的高山大河，都一一被你们劳动的双手和顽强的意志战胜了。你们为祖国为西藏人民立下了不朽的功劳，创造了世界公路修筑史上前所未有的奇迹，你们的光荣不仅将流传在我们西藏人民永恒的记忆里，也将为全国人民所赞扬称颂！
    在庆祝公路通车拉萨的今天，我们愿向全国人民表示：在伟大的中国共产党、中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席和中华人民共和国国务院的领导下，更加加强和巩固民族之间以及民族内部的团结，一致为建设我们伟大的祖国和繁荣幸福的新西藏而努力奋斗！
    谨向你们致以亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意！
    在修筑公路中光荣牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽！
