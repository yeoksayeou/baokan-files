He said, "The concept of India-China friendship has taken deep root in the hearts of our people, not only because of our cultural relations over thousands of years, but also because, in the current situation, we firmly believe that the Chinese and Indian people are peace-loving and equally ardent in their support for the peace, freedom, and prosperity of all nations in the world."
