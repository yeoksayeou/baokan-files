    Another New Achievement in China's Electric Power Industry Construction
    The newly built Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant, the largest power plant in North China, officially began partial power transmission on December 28th after more than a year of intense construction. This is another encouraging good news in China's electric power industry construction.
    The Taiyuan area is one of the industrial centers of North China. In recent years, the output of industrial production and basic construction projects have grown rapidly. The total industrial output value has exceeded three times that of the early days of liberation, and many large-scale new factories and mines have been built or are under construction. With the development of production, the urban population has also grown rapidly. Therefore, the supply of electricity is becoming increasingly tight. Now, the start of power transmission from the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant will provide these factories and mines with a powerful new impetus, which will inevitably strongly promote the further development of industrial construction in the Taiyuan area.
    The construction of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant marks a new development in China's electric power industry technology. The Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant is a new type of thermal power plant designed with the latest technical standards with the help of the Soviet Union. After it is fully completed, it will produce a strong electricity equivalent to three times the existing power generation capacity of Taiyuan. It will also use a large amount of steam generated after power generation to supply nearby factories and residences. Therefore, the utilization of coal heat is greatly improved, the cost of electricity is greatly reduced, and other factories and residences reduce many expenses, thereby saving a lot of wealth for the country. At the same time, the construction of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant shows that the construction of China's thermal power industry has a good start.
    The Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant is a new project with very complex technology and high technical requirements. The construction period is short and the preparation work is insufficient, so the task is very difficult. However, thanks to the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts, the active support of local leading organs, and the hard work of all employees, the progress of the project has finally been guaranteed. The completed part of the project has been proven to be of good quality after trial operation. Obviously, this is a great achievement. During the construction process, the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant had serious waste due to poor management. After being criticized by the leading organs, they vigorously improved their work, carried out mass anti-waste campaigns, and improved construction management, basically reversing the waste and chaos. This positive attitude is also welcome. Now the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant has started the second phase of the project. It is hoped that all employees of the engineering company will continue to work hard without pride or impetuosity, and strive for the early and successful completion of all projects of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant. The production personnel of the Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant should work harder to learn Soviet operating techniques, become familiar with operating procedures, ensure that this newly built large-scale power plant in China operates normally, and continuously transmit strong electricity to factories and mines.

### 我国电力工业建设的又一新成就

    我国电力工业建设的又一新成就
    我国华北地区最大的发电厂——新建太原电热厂，经过一年多时间的紧张施工，已于十二月二十八日正式开始部分送电。这是我国电力工业建设上又一个令人鼓舞的喜讯。
    太原地区是我国华北的工业中心之一，几年来工业生产产量和基本建设工程都增长很快，现有工业总产值已超过解放初期的三倍以上，不少规模巨大的新型工厂和矿山，已经建成或正在建设中。随着生产事业的发展，城市人口也迅速增长。因而电的供应日趋紧张。现在，太原电热厂的开始送电，就使得这些工厂和矿山获得了强大的新动力，它必然将有力地推动太原地区工业建设的进一步发展。
    太原电热厂的建设，标志着我国电力工业技术的新发展。太原电热厂是苏联帮助我国以最新的技术标准进行设计的一座新型的火力发电厂，它全部建成以后，将生产出等于太原现有发电能力三倍的强大电力，还将利用发电后的大量蒸汽，供应附近的工厂和住宅。因此就大大地提高了煤的热量的利用，使电的成本大为降低，并使其他工厂和住宅减少许多费用，从而为国家节约大量的财富。同时太原电热厂的建设，表明我国热电事业的建设有了一个良好的开端。
    太原电热厂是一项技术十分复杂的新工程，技术上的要求很高，而施工时期短，准备工作不足，任务是很艰巨的。但由于苏联专家的热诚指导，当地领导机关的积极支持，和全体员工的艰苦劳动，终于保证了工程的进度，已经完成的部分工程经过试运转，证明质量良好，显然，这是一个很大的成绩。太原电热厂在建设过程中由于管理不善，曾经发生过严重的浪费现象，经领导机关批评以后，他们就大力改进工作，开展了群众性的反浪费运动，改进了施工管理，基本上扭转了浪费和混乱现象，这种积极态度也是值得欢迎的。现在太原电热厂已开始了第二期工程，希望工程公司的全体员工，不骄不躁，继续努力，争取太原电热厂全部工程的早日胜利完成。太原电热厂的生产人员，更应当努力学习苏联的操作技术，熟习操作规程，保证这座我国新建的大型发电厂正常地进行工作，把强大的电力不间断地输送到工厂和矿山。
