Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, November 27th: According to TASS, the second diesel-electric icebreaker manufactured for the Soviet Union by the Finnish Wärtsilä Corporation, in accordance with the Finnish-Soviet trade agreement, was launched on the 27th at the Hietalahti shipyard. The ceremony was attended by Finnish Prime Minister Kekkonen, Foreign Minister Virolainen, Minister of Trade and Industry Simonen, and representatives of the shipbuilding company and workers.

The Soviet side was represented by Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikoyan, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Borisov, Head of the Northern Sea Route Administration Bukhanov, Soviet Ambassador to Finland Lebedev, Soviet Trade Representative to Finland Sosunov, as well as personnel from the Soviet Embassy in Finland and trade representatives.

After the launching ceremony, the guests boarded the first icebreaker, the "Captain Belousov," and took a test voyage in the Gulf of Finland. At this time, the Finnish flag on the ship was lowered, and the Soviet flag was raised. Mikoyan inspected the icebreaker.

Wärtsilä Corporation's General Manager Wahlforss welcomed Mikoyan and his entourage in the icebreaker's dining room. He expressed satisfaction with the cooperation in delivering goods to the Soviet Union and hoped to continue developing this cooperation.

Then, after Wahlforss delivered a welcoming speech, Mikoyan delivered a speech. He said: "Almost a year ago, the first ship ordered by the Soviet Union in Finland, the icebreaker 'Captain Belousov,' was launched in this shipyard. Today, we are again participating in the flag-raising ceremony of this icebreaker, the launching of the second ship ordered by the Soviet Union, the icebreaker 'Captain Voronin,' and the commencement ceremony of the third icebreaker 'Captain Melekhov.' We are very pleased and grateful to have accepted the invitation from the Finnish government to attend this ceremony, because this is primarily new proof of the growing good neighborly and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland.

Ships built by Finnish shipyards, like other products of Finnish industry, enjoy a high reputation in our country for their excellent quality.

We express our gratitude to the Finnish workers, engineers, technicians, and all the builders who built these ships for the Soviet Union, for their skill and hard work.

These characteristics of the Finnish people are very dear and understandable to the Soviet people, who regard labor as glorious and attach great importance to the fruits of labor. It is no coincidence that the icebreakers being built in these shipyards will be named after the captains of the Soviet Arctic, the simple, tireless maritime workers.

It is symbolic that Soviet sailors will become the crew of the icebreakers built by Finnish technicians. We now see the friendship between the people of our two neighboring countries growing closer in the process of work and heroic endeavors.

This is actually a form of friendly cooperation in technology and economy between our two countries. This is a good and stable division of labor and frequent commercial exchanges between neighboring countries. These exchanges are possible because the Soviet Union needs ships to navigate its vast sea areas; on the other hand, Finland's shipbuilding industry has great potential. Now we have sufficient reason to say the same for other sectors of the economy. The economic, political, and cultural relations between our two peoples are strengthening year by year, and the relations between the Soviet Union and Finland are a good example of cooperation between countries with different social systems. We in the Soviet Union practice the socialist system, and you in Finland practice the capitalist system.

Good neighborly and friendly relations, and the reason why such relations can develop is that they are based on mutual respect, mutual trust, and complete equality. The development of our relations points the way for the peaceful cooperation of the people of other countries, breaking the ice of mutual distrust and strengthening mutual understanding and genuine friendship.

The good neighborly and friendly relations between our two countries are based on the solid foundation of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed between the Soviet Union and Finland in 1948.

Therefore, not only our annual economic agreements, but also our long-term economic agreements have become a beneficial tradition. The first of these long-term agreements was valid for five years (from 1951 to 1955). This agreement is now being implemented victoriously. Today, the total volume of trade between the Soviet Union and Finland is already 3.5 times that of 1950, which alone shows that long-term trade agreements are beneficial to both sides. Because they provide a clear prospect for commercial relations and allow both countries to know for sure that they can sell or buy a certain amount of goods.

Based on this successful experience, the governments of the two countries, before the expiration of the current five-year trade agreement in 1955, signed another five-year economic agreement this summer, which is valid from 1956 to 1960. This agreement guarantees Finland the opportunity to sell a large number of ships, equipment, timber, and various products of the paper industry in the coming years; on the other hand, this agreement also stipulates that the Soviet Union will export to Finland grain, cotton, oil products, metals, automobiles, complete sets of industrial equipment, and fertilizers.

As everyone knows, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Finnish Parliament has approved the Soviet-Finnish trade agreement (1956-1960) proposed by the Finnish government. In its resolution, the Foreign Affairs Committee pointed out that trade between the Soviet Union and Finland is developing in a direction that is beneficial to both sides. We fully agree with this conclusion: Soviet-Finnish trade is beneficial to both sides.

At the beginning of this year, the Soviet Union granted Finland a loan of 40 million rubles on favorable terms, with a loan period of ten years. The Finnish government can use this loan at will, and it does not have any open or secret conditions attached, unlike other loans granted by some countries.

Precisely because the relations between our two countries are based on mutual respect for each other's interests and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, we can hope to continue to develop our economic and cultural relations and our friendship. In these areas, there is still great potential that has not been utilized.

The Finnish people have a very developed national culture, which our people appreciate and respect.

The Soviet people are very interested in the works of Finnish writers, composers, sculptors, scientists, and other cultural workers. We hope to publish more books by Finnish writers and scientists in the Soviet Union, and more works by Finnish composers.

We are also very happy that Finland is becoming increasingly interested in the cultural achievements of the Soviet people.

We have all the necessary conditions to further expand our developing cultural relations in the coming years. Let more Finnish intellectuals visit the Soviet Union, and let more Soviet cultural workers and scientists visit Finland.

One cannot but admire the role played by Finnish Prime Minister Kekkonen in establishing and implementing the excellent tradition of concluding long-term trade agreements between our two countries.

We also cannot ignore the Prime Minister's efforts in implementing the policy guided by President Paasikivi—a policy of promoting friendly and good-neighborly relations between Finland and the Soviet Union.

The friendly relations between our two countries enable us to make a joint contribution to strengthening world peace and security. The Soviet Union and Finland believe that their most important task is to ease international tensions and take action from the perspective of uniting the efforts of all countries to ensure peace.

The Soviet Union unswervingly implements a policy of strengthening peace, because peace is what the people of all countries desire. Their desire is understandable. Indeed, no issue touches the hearts of the masses more than the issue of war or peace, nothing is more important than the interests of the security of the people of all countries, and the people of all countries have no greater desire than to safeguard the cause of peace. Therefore, the Soviet Union opposes the remilitarization of Germany, opposes the organization of military alliances that divide Europe and the people of the world, and strives to establish an all-European security system that includes countries large and small—regardless of their social and national systems.

The Soviet people have an extremely respectful and friendly attitude towards their neighbor—the hardworking Finnish people. Our common task is to continue to strengthen the friendly and good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland.”

Mikoyan also spoke with the shipbuilding workers. They thanked the Soviet government for the orders to the shipyard, which enabled them to have work and helped further strengthen the friendly relations between Finland and the Soviet Union. They said that they would work hard to complete the Soviet orders.

Mikoyan thanked the workers for their warm welcome and expressed his belief that their work would promote the consolidation of economic ties and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Finland. He thanked these shipbuilding workers and all the Finnish workers on behalf of the Soviet government, the Soviet people, and in his own name. He also conveyed the congratulations of the Soviet workers to the Finnish workers.

    在芬兰参加为苏联制造的破冰船下水典礼
    苏联部长会议副主席米高扬发表演说
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社赫尔辛基十一月二十七日电：依照芬苏贸易协定由芬兰韦齐利有限公司为苏联制造的第二艘柴油电动破冰船二十七日在赫塔拉蒂船坞举行下水典礼。出席典礼的有芬兰总理吉科宁、外交部长维洛莱宁、工商部长西莫宁及造船公司和工人的代表。
    苏联方面出席典礼的有苏联部长会议副主席米高扬、苏联对外贸易部第一副部长波里索夫、北海航线管理局局长布哈诺夫、苏联驻芬兰大使列别杰夫、苏联驻芬兰贸易代表索苏诺夫，以及苏联驻芬兰大使馆人员和贸易代表。
    下水典礼举行后，客人们上了第一艘破冰船
  “别洛乌索夫船长号”，并在芬兰湾试航。这时，船上的芬兰国旗降下来了，升起了苏联的国旗。米高扬巡视了这艘破冰船。
    韦齐利有限公司总经理华尔弗斯在破冰船的餐室里欢迎米高扬和同他一起来的人员。他对在向苏联交货方面的合作表示满意，并希望继续发展这种合作。
    接着，在华尔弗斯致欢迎词后，米高扬发表了演说。他说：“差不多一年前，苏联在芬兰订造的第一艘船只破冰船‘别洛乌索夫船长号’在这个船坞下水。今天，我们又参加了这艘破冰船的升旗典礼、苏联订造的第二艘船只破冰船‘沃罗宁舰长号’的下水和第三艘破冰船‘麦列霍夫船长号’的开工典礼。我们十分高兴地接受了芬兰政府的邀请我们参加这个典礼，并且表示感谢，因为这首先是苏芬两国间睦邻和友好关系日益加强的新的证明。
    芬兰造船厂造的船只，正如芬兰工业的其他一些产品一样，它们的优秀质量在我国享有很高的声誉。
    我们向芬兰工人、工程师、技师和为苏联建造这些船只的所有建造者表示感谢，感谢他们的技艺和辛勤的劳动。
    芬兰人民的这些特点对于把劳动看作是光荣，并十分重视劳动成果的苏联人民说来，是十分亲切和可以理解的。这些造船厂正在建造的破冰船，将用苏联北极的船长，朴实的、不倦的海上劳动者的名字来命名，这不是一件偶然的事。
    苏联水手们将成为芬兰技工所建造的破冰船的船员，这是有象征意义的。我们现在在工作过程和英雄的事业中看到了两个邻国的人民的友谊正在日益密切起来。
    这实际上是我们两国间在技术和经济方面的友好合作的一种形式。这是相邻国家间妥善、稳定的分工，和频繁的商业来往。这种来往之所以能够进行，是因为苏联方面需要船只在我们祖国的广大海面航行；另一方面是由于芬兰的造船工业有很大的潜力。现在对经济的其他部门，我们也有充分的理由这样说。我们两国人民之间的经济、政治和文化关系正在一年年地加强，苏芬之间的关系是不同社会制度的国家进行合作的良好范例。我们苏联实行的是社会主义制度，你们芬兰实行的是资本主义制度。
    良好的睦邻和友好关系，而所以能发展这种关系是因为这种关系是以双方互相尊重、互相信任和完全平等为基础的。我们的关系的发展为其他国家人民指出了和平合作的道路，打破了互不信任的冰块，加强了相互间的谅解和真正的友谊。
    我们两国良好的睦邻和友好关系是建立在苏联和芬兰在一九四八年签订的友好合作互助条约这个坚固的基础之上的。
    因此，不仅我们两国间的年度经济协定，而且我们两国间的长期经济协定已经成为一种有益的传统。这些长期协定中的第一个协定的有效期限是五年（从一九五一—一九五五年）。现在这个协定正在胜利地执行着。今天，苏芬间的贸易总量已经等于一九五零年的三点五倍，单是这一点就表明了长期贸易协定是对双方有利的。因为它们为商业关系提供了一个明确的前景，而且使两国都可以确实知道将可出售或买进一定数量的货物。
    两国政府从这种胜利的经验出发，在目前的五年贸易协定在一九五五年届满以前，今年夏季两国又签订了另一个五年经济协定，它的有效期限是从一九五六年到一九六零年。这个协定保证了芬兰在今后数年中可以出售大量船只、设备、木材和造纸工业的各种产品的机会；另一方面，这个协定也规定由苏联向芬兰输出谷物、棉花、石油产品、金属、汽车、整套工业设备和肥料等。
    大家知道，芬兰议会外交委员会已经批准了芬兰政府建议的苏芬贸易协定（一九五六—一九六○年）。外交委员会在决议中指出，苏联和芬兰的贸易正在沿着有利于双方的方向发展。我们完全同意这个结论：苏芬贸易有利于双方。
    苏联在今年年初以优惠的条件贷给芬兰四千万卢布，贷款时期是十年。芬兰政府可以随意使用这笔贷款，它不像其他某些国家所给予的不同贷款那样附有公开的或秘密的条件。
    正因为我们两国之间的关系是以互相尊重彼此的利益和不干涉彼此内政为基础的，所以我们能够希望继续发展我们的经济和文化关系和我们的友谊，在这些方面，还有很大的潜力没有利用。
    芬兰人民有着很发达的民族文化，这是我们的人民所欣赏和尊重的。
    苏联人民对芬兰作家、作曲家、雕刻家、科学家和其他文化工作者的作品很感兴趣。我们希望在苏联出版更多的芬兰作家和科学家的书籍，更多的芬兰作曲家的作品。
    我们也很高兴：芬兰对苏联人民的文化成就越来越感到兴趣。
    我们具有一切必要的条件来在今后几年中进一步扩大我们的正在发展中的文化关系。让更多的芬兰知识分子访问苏联，让更多的苏联文化工作者和科学家访问芬兰。
    人们不能不赞扬芬兰总理吉科宁在建立和实现我们两国之间缔结长期贸易协定的优良传统方面所起的作用。
    我们也不能忽视总理在贯彻巴锡基维总统所指导的政策——促进芬苏两国友好和睦邻关系的政策方面所表现的努力。
    我们两国间的友好关系，使我们能够对加强世界和平和安全作出共同的贡献。苏芬两国认为它们最重要的任务是缓和国际紧张局势，并从联合一切国家的努力来保障和平出发，采取行动。
    苏联坚持不渝地执行着加强和平的政策，因为和平是各国人民所企望的。他们这种愿望是可以理解的。的确，没有任何一个问题比战争或和平这个问题更打动群众的心弦了，没有任何东西比各国人民安全的利益更重要，各国人民没有比维护和平事业更大的愿望。因此，苏联反对德国重新军国主义化，反对组织分裂欧洲和世界各国人民的军事联盟，并为建立一个包括大小国家——不问其社会和国家制度如何——的全欧安全体系而努力。
    苏联人民对他们的邻邦——勤劳的芬兰人民的态度是极其尊重和友好的。我们共同的任务是继续加强苏芬两国间的友好和睦邻关系。”
    米高扬还同造船工人进行了谈话。他们感谢苏联政府对造船厂的订货，这种订货使他们有工作做，并有利于进一步加强芬兰和苏联的友好关系。他们说，他们将努力工作来完成苏联的订货。
    米高扬感谢工人们的热烈欢迎，并表示相信：他们的工作将促进苏联和芬兰的经济联系和友好关系的巩固。他代表苏联政府，苏联人民并以他个人的名义感谢这些造船工人和芬兰全体工人。他还向芬兰工人们转达了苏联工人们的祝贺。
