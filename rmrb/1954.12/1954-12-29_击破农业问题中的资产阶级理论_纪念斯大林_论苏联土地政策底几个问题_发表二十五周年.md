    Crushing the Bourgeois Theories in Agricultural Issues
    —Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of Stalin's "Concerning the Soviet Land Policy Issues"
    Peng Dazhang
    Published twenty-five years ago, the article "Concerning the Soviet Land Policy Issues" is an important document of Marxist theory. Due to the publication of this work, several bourgeois theories in the socialist transformation of agriculture in the Soviet Union at that time were thoroughly shattered. Understanding the circumstances under which these bourgeois theories arose, how Stalin criticized them, and which of those issues are relevant to us today, is of great help to us in studying the theory of agricultural collectivization.
    Implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture is another revolutionary task after the working class seizes power. The basic requirement of this task is to eliminate capitalism in rural areas, change the old relations of production in rural areas, and establish new socialist relations of production. Therefore, this is an extremely profound and broad revolutionary movement that touches everything and affects everything. This movement is bound to arouse resistance from the rural bourgeoisie and intensify class struggle. The situation in the Soviet Union at that time was precisely like this.
    In 1927, the Soviet Union had already entered the period of socialist transformation of the national economy. Socialist industry had already achieved a decisive victory, but in agriculture, the individual economy still dominated, and polarization had not completely stopped. There were only over a thousand state-owned farms throughout the country, and only 0.8 percent of peasant households participated in collective farms. The socialist forces were still very weak. The strength of the rich peasants had been weakened considerably during a period after the October Revolution, but in the few years of the economic recovery period, there had been new growth in terms of both population and economic strength. They had more than 5.6 million people and produced a total of 600 million poods of grain annually, which was much larger than the 80 million poods produced annually by state-owned farms and collective farms. The rich peasants could transport about 130 million poods of marketable grain to the market, which was also much larger than the 35 million poods of marketable grain that state-owned farms and collective farms could transport to the market. These situations were enough to show that the strength of the rich peasant class was a serious and non-negligible force at that time. Coupled with several bumper years, the rich peasant class accumulated considerable capital, and their strength became even more consolidated.
    Under these circumstances, the capitalist forces in the countryside gradually became rampant, and their resistance to the socialist transformation of agriculture became increasingly fierce. In 1928, just as the country was experiencing food difficulties, large numbers of rich peasants refused to sell their surplus grain to the state. They even resorted to terrorist means to deal with collective farmers, killing Party and Soviet workers in rural areas, slaughtering draught animals, and setting fire to collective farms and state warehouses.
    This resistance of the rural bourgeoisie could not but be reflected in the theoretical and ideological front, and many anti-Marxist-Leninist agricultural theories arose under such circumstances, among which particularly popular views were the "equilibrium" theory, the "self-flow" theory of socialist construction, the "stability" theory of the small-peasant economy, and the "scissors crisis" theory.
    Compared with Bukharin's theory of rich peasants "growing into" socialism on their own, these bourgeois theories differed in their arguments, but their purpose was to oppose agricultural collectivization. Stalin focused on the necessity of agricultural collectivization and criticized various anti-collectivization nonsense. In this paper, in addition to demonstrating, based on Soviet practice, that Marx's principle of the superiority of large-scale economy over small-scale economy applies not only to industry but also to agriculture, he also clarified three main issues:
    (1) Socialist society cannot be built spontaneously, nor can the socialist transformation of agriculture be realized spontaneously. While refuting the "equilibrium" theory, Stalin pointed out that behind the socialist economy and the capitalist economy, there are corresponding classes. During the transition period, these classes are engaged in a life-and-death struggle based on the principle of "who defeats whom." It is fundamentally impossible for them to "coexist peacefully," let alone hope that this parallel development will naturally lead to a socialist society one day. Stalin's argument is based on Lenin's theory. As early as the period of economic recovery, Lenin pointed out: "We will wage this 'final decisive battle' not with international capitalism—there will be many more 'final decisive battles' there—but with Russian capitalism, with Russian capitalism that grows out of small-peasant economy and is supported by small-peasant economy." [1] That is to say, when the socialist economy and the capitalist economy still coexist during the transition period, there is a struggle between two futures: socialist society and capitalist society. The outcome of the struggle can only be one victory and the other defeated.
    While refuting the "self-flow" theory, Stalin analyzed their natural tendencies from the category of economy. He pointed out that the small-peasant economy is based on private ownership, and it is basically an economy of the same type as the capitalist economy, so it can only spontaneously follow the capitalist cities, but not spontaneously follow the socialist cities. Lenin once taught us that when we still live in a small-peasant country, capitalism in Russia has a more solid economic foundation than communism. Because "small production constantly, daily, hourly, spontaneously and on a mass scale engenders capitalism and the bourgeoisie." [2] Since the natural trend of the small-peasant economy is capitalism rather than socialism, it is impossible for it to embark on the socialist path spontaneously. This requires long-term, complex, and arduous educational work. Empty talk about the socialist transformation of agriculture can be realized spontaneously is tantamount to canceling the socialist transformation.
    (2) The socialist cause cannot be built for a long time on the two different foundations of a huge, centralized socialist industrial economy and the most scattered and backward small-commodity agricultural economy. Stalin's argument is based on Marx's theory of reproduction, analyzed from the actual economic situation in the Soviet Union at that time. The reason why socialist large-scale industry can expand and develop at a high speed is because it is developing according to the principle of expanded reproduction, it has its own accumulation, and its capacity is increasing year by year, while the individual small-scale agriculture is based on simple manual labor, with very low productivity. Not only can it not carry out expanded reproduction, but sometimes it cannot even maintain simple reproduction. Once it encounters unexpected disasters, it immediately falls into bankruptcy. This difference between industry and agriculture shows that it is fundamentally impossible for them to develop in a balanced way. In the end, the development of industry itself will also become a problem. Because "agriculture is the foundation of industry, and the growth of agriculture is also the growth of the industrialization's grain base and raw material base. Without the corresponding development of agriculture, the long-term development of industry is objectively impossible." [3]
    In order to enable agriculture to also implement accumulation and expanded reproduction, we must transform the small-peasant economy into socialist collective agriculture.
    (3) Agricultural collectivization is the inevitable path to eliminate the opposition between town and country. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie uses various means to cruelly exploit the peasants, and the relationship of opposition between town and country reaches an extremely sharp stage. In the early stage of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, the problem of opposition between town and country still existed. However, the socialist regime is based on the worker-peasant alliance, and its task is to eliminate classes, eliminate all exploitation, and integrate the countryside and the city into an economic whole, so that the countryside and the city can reach unity. It can be seen that the problem of opposition between town and country can only be a problem that exists within a certain period.
    Therefore, the "scissors crisis" problem, which is one of the contents of the problem of opposition between town and country, can only be a problem that exists within a certain period. Moreover, the nature of the "scissors crisis" problem in socialist society is fundamentally different from that in capitalist society. In capitalist society, the bourgeoisie uses the "scissors difference" method to extract high profits from peasants, while the "scissors difference" under socialist social conditions is a necessary but temporary method that has to be adopted in order to rapidly develop industry. At the same time, the burden imposed on peasants by this method can be completely borne under the condition of continuous improvement of peasants' lives. The right-wing opportunists do not understand this principle, and clamor for "military feudal exploitation" and "the October Revolution did not give the peasants anything," which is completely absurd nonsense.
    Stalin said that the peasants have greatly improved their labor productivity and reduced production costs as a result of obtaining state assistance and jointly organizing collective farms, and they can earn more income when selling grain than before. This alone can make the peasants' economic situation greatly improved compared with before the October Revolution. If the collective farm movement continues to develop at the existing speed with the help of cities, so that the peasants' economic situation can continue to improve and increase, then the peasants will naturally trust the cities and automatically put forward the slogan of "facing the cities," and the opposition between town and country will naturally be eliminated. In this way, Stalin strictly opposed the path planned by the Party to eliminate the opposition between town and country to the path advocated by the Bukharin elements. The path advocated by the Bukharin elements is to maximize the price of agricultural products, restore the "normal state" of the market, allow complete free trade, and allow the rich peasants to freely manipulate prices in the market. Obviously, this only facilitates the development of rural capitalism, which not only cannot eliminate the opposition between town and country, but will inevitably make it more acute.
    Our country's socialist transformation of agriculture has some special historical conditions, so we can take measures to restrict its development and gradually eliminate the rich peasant economy, without taking measures to expropriate it. But this does not mean that we can relax the struggle against the rich peasants. Those classes that will be eliminated will inevitably carry out desperate resistance in order to save their fate of death. The rich peasants are no exception. The various sabotage activities of rich peasants in various parts of the country in the past two years can fully prove this principle.
    At the same time, we must also pay attention to the fact that there are various views and thoughts in our country that reflect the class consciousness of the rich peasants, although these views and thoughts have not yet been concentrated to form a theoretical system. For example:
    1. In the agricultural cooperativization movement, some rich peasants preached to the middle peasants such nonsense as "everyone does their own thing and does not interfere with each other," which is a manifestation of the "maintain the status quo" thought.
    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said when criticizing the thought of "maintaining the status quo": "It is impossible for two opposing relations of production, socialism and capitalism, to develop in parallel in a country without interfering with each other." Why is it impossible? First, the new relations of production open up the road for the development of productive forces, while the old relations of production restrict the development of productive forces. The long-term coexistence of these two different relations of production will inevitably lead to a serious imbalance in production, and even lead to the collapse of the national economy. This is the case within a country, and it is also the case within an economic sector. In the past few years since the land reform in our country, the tension that the supply of agricultural products cannot keep up with the needs of national construction has already occurred due to the dominance of the individual economy in agriculture. If we let the small-peasant economy continue to exist in agriculture for a long time, it will not only hinder the development of agricultural productive forces itself, but also hinder the entire economic construction cause. Second, behind the two opposing relations of production stand classes with conflicting interests, and they demand conflicting directions of development. This principle can be seen very clearly from the specific situation of class struggle in rural areas. Now the vast majority of conscious working peasants, because they realize that the fragility of the small-peasant economy makes them still unable to fundamentally get rid of poverty, so they are actively and enthusiastically participating in and developing agricultural production cooperatives and embarking on the road of socialist construction. However, many rich peasants feel that the development of agricultural production cooperatives poses a threat to them, so they are doing everything possible to sabotage them from the outside and inside. Often some middle peasants are unwilling or dare not participate in cooperatives, or leave cooperatives halfway, and even some cooperatives are ruined or deteriorated by them under their instigation, solicitation, rumor-mongering, and intimidation. This activity of the rich peasants seriously hinders the socialist transformation of agriculture. It can be seen that the rich peasants' remarks of "everyone does their own thing and does not interfere with each other" is precisely an activity that undermines agricultural cooperativization. Therefore, to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, we must refute this fallacy of the rich peasant class.
    2. Some people believe that the situation of peasants has not improved much after liberation, and they clamor that "the peasants' burden is still very heavy." This kind of person appears as a representative of the interests of peasants, demanding immediate and thorough improvement of the peasants' lives. This argument exaggerates certain inevitable differences between the lives of workers and peasants, the lives of cities and villages, and demands the full satisfaction of the peasants' immediate and narrow interests, regardless of the peasants' long-term and fundamental interests. This will only hinder the necessary speed of our socialist industrialization and prolong the life of capitalism.
    We know that after liberation, peasants were relieved of feudal land rent exploitation, abolished the large amount of exorbitant taxes imposed on them by the reactionary rule, obtained various production and relief loans from the government, and implemented mutual assistance and cooperation, etc. All of these have improved the living conditions of most peasants compared with before liberation, which is an undeniable fact. Although there is a certain degree of burden now, it is necessary for building socialism. The completion of socialist society cannot be achieved without paying a considerable price. The working class in the cities launches labor competitions, improves production efficiency, and carries out technological innovations, using selfless labor spirit to build socialist industry; peasants should also endure some temporary difficulties and do their best to support this construction. Only when the construction of socialist industry continues to win victories can the lives of peasants be improved.
    It is undeniable that there are contradictions between town and country now, which are mainly contradictions between socialist large-scale industry and small-peasant economy. The development of socialist industry requires the transformation of urban and rural capitalism, while the small-peasant economy has a spontaneous capitalist tendency and constantly secretes capitalism; the construction of socialist industry requires a rapid supply of a large amount of agricultural products, while the product supply of the small-peasant economy is small and the speed of increase is very slow; the construction of socialist industry requires the planned development of crops, while the scattered small-peasant economy is carrying out unplanned blind production. This series of contradictions must be overcome, and there is only one way to overcome them, that is, to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture and turn agriculture into collective, huge, and mechanized agriculture. In the process of the socialist transformation of agriculture, urban workers supply rural areas with a large number of machines, tractors, technical talents, and various industrial products, which will gradually make the relationship between the working class and peasants, between cities and villages in our country more harmonious.
    3. In addition, there is also the argument of so-called "freedom of buying and selling." This is in opposition to the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of agricultural products, especially grain. People who hold this idea believe that the unified purchase and sale interferes with their freedom of buying and selling and restricts their development, saying: "The government is managing too much, and we can't be our own masters." They use certain shortcomings in the actual work of unified purchase and sale to spread rumors and attack them. They demand complete freedom in the grain market, that is, so-called freedom of the amount of buying and selling, freedom of time, freedom of location, and freedom of price.
    The demand for "freedom of buying and selling" objectively reflects the rich peasants' resistance to socialist transformation. After the implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy, the capitalist elements in the countryside can no longer use grain to speculate and hoard in the market, and can no longer use grain to carry out high-interest exploitation of poor peasants. Therefore, the clamor and resistance of certain rich peasant elements are inevitable.
    The existence of a free grain market is not allowed by socialist industrialization, the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the cause of the worker-peasant alliance. Because, if a completely free market for grain is allowed, the rich peasants and speculators can hoard and speculate, and take the opportunity to arbitrarily raise grain prices. As a result of the increase in grain prices, the prices of other crops used as industrial raw materials have to be increased accordingly, and the wages of workers have to be increased accordingly. Thus, the cost and price of industrial products have to be increased accordingly, which will inevitably shrink the market for industrial products and make it impossible for socialist industry to develop. If a completely free market for grain is allowed, it is equal to indulging the development of rural capitalism, and the continued development of rural capitalist forces will make it impossible to realize the collectivization of agriculture. If a completely free market for grain is allowed, the prices of agricultural products and industrial products will rise continuously in a cycle that is interconnected. As a result of the continuous price increases, cities cannot get cheap agricultural products, peasants cannot get cheap industrial products, and the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance will be seriously threatened.
    Stalin emphasized in "Concerning the Soviet Land Policy Issues" that the reason why this anti-Marxist theory of the rich peasants was able to be openly disseminated at that time was mainly because the theoretical and ideological work in the Soviet Union at that time could not keep up with the practical requirements of socialist economic construction. Therefore, a distance was created between practical achievements and the development of theoretical ideas, giving the class enemies an opportunity to take advantage of it.
    Now, our country has achieved great achievements in socialist construction, but our theoretical and ideological work is quite weak and lags behind the requirements of practice. Moreover, the theoretical and ideological circles have long lacked struggle against bourgeois ideology, and some people have even adopted a capitulationist attitude towards bourgeois ideology, which is very worthy of our vigilance. Therefore, we must strengthen theoretical and ideological work and carry out irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois ideology. Only in this way can we overcome difficulties and smoothly transition to socialist society.

    击破农业问题中的资产阶级理论
    ——纪念斯大林“论苏联土地政策底几个问题”发表二十五周年
    彭达彰
    二十五年前发表的“论苏联土地政策底几个问题”一文，是马克思主义理论的一个重要文献。由于这一著作的发表，当时苏联农业的社会主义改造问题中几个资产阶级理论被彻底粉碎了。了解这些资产阶级理论在什么情况下产生，斯大林对这些理论怎样批判，其中那些问题和我们今天有关，对于我们学习农业集体化的理论，是有很大帮助的。
    对农业实行社会主义改造，这是工人阶级取得政权后的又一项革命任务。这项任务的基本要求，是要消灭农村中的资本主义，改变农村中旧有的生产关系，建立新的社会主义的生产关系。所以这是一个极其深刻广泛、触动一切、影响一切的革命运动。这一运动，必然要引起农村资产阶级的反抗，引起阶级斗争的激烈化。苏联当时的情形正是这样。
    一九二七年苏联已经进入国民经济的社会主义改造时期。社会主义的工业已经获得了预决性的胜利，但在农业中，仍以个体经济占优势，两极分化还未完全停止。国营农场在全国范围只有一千多个，参加集体农庄的农户仅占总农户百分之零点八，社会主义的力量还非常薄弱。富农的力量在十月革命后的一个时期曾削弱不少，可是在经济恢复时期的几年中，无论是人口方面或经济力量方面，都有新的增长。它拥有五百六十多万人口，年产的谷物共达六万万普特，比之国营农场和集体农庄年产八千万普特数量要大得多。富农能运往市场的商品粮食约一万万三千万普特，比国营农场和集体农庄能运往市场的商品粮食三千五百万普特也大得多。这些情形，就足够说明富农阶级的力量在当时是一个严重不可忽视的力量。加上几次丰年，富农阶级聚积了相当的资本，它们的力量更加巩固起来。
    在这种情况下，农村资本主义势力就逐渐嚣张起来，它们对农业的社会主义改造进行日趋激烈的反抗。一九二八年，正当国家粮食发生困难时，大批大批富农拒绝将余粮卖给国家。他们甚至采取恐怖手段对付集体农民，杀害农村中党的和苏维埃的工作人员，杀害耕畜，放火焚烧集体农庄和国家仓库等。
    农村资产阶级的这种反抗，不能不在理论思想战线方面反映出来，许多反马克思列宁主义的农业理论就在这种情况下产生了，其中特别流行的见解是“平衡”论，社会主义建设事业“自流”论，小农经济“稳固”论，“剪刀形态”论等。
    这些资产阶级理论，和布哈林的富农自行“长入”社会主义的理论相比，论点虽各有不同，但其目的都是反对农业集体化。斯大林就以农业必须集体化为中心，针对各种反集体化的胡说进行批判。他在这篇论文中，除根据苏联的实践，论证了马克思的大经济优于小经济的原理不仅适用于工业，同样适用于农业外，还阐明了三个主要问题：
    （一）社会主义社会不能自流地建成，农业的社会主义改造也不能自流地实现。斯大林在驳斥
  “平衡”论时指出，社会主义经济和资本主义经济的背后，各占有相当的阶级，这些阶级在过渡时期，是以“谁战胜谁”为原则进行着你死我活的斗争，根本不可能“和平共处”，更不可能希望这种平行发展到某一天自然地出现社会主义社会。斯大林的这一论断，是以列宁的理论为根据的。列宁早在经济恢复时期，就曾指出：“我们要进行这‘最后的决战’，不是同国际资本主义，——那里将还有多次‘最后的决战’，——而是同俄国资本主义，同那从小农经济中成长起来，并由小农经济支持着的俄国资本主义，进行此种决战”〔一〕。这就是说，当社会主义经济和资本主义经济还同时存在的过渡时期，它就有社会主义社会和资本主义社会两个前途的斗争，斗争的结局，只能是一个胜利，另一个被打败。
    斯大林在驳斥“自流”论时，又从经济的类别来分析它们的自然趋向。他指出，小农经济是以私有制为基础的，它基本上是和资本主义经济同类型的经济，所以它只能自流地跟着资本主义城市走，而不能自流地跟着社会主义城市走。列宁曾经教导我们说：当我们还生活在小农国家时，资本主义在俄国比共产主义有更坚固的经济基础。因为“小生产是经常地，每日每时地，自发地大批产生着资本主义和资产阶级的”〔二〕。小农经济的自然趋势既是资本主义而不是社会主义，所以它就不可能自流地走上社会主义轨道。这里需要有长期的、复杂而艰巨的教育工作。空谈农业的社会主义改造可以自流地实现，那就是等于取消社会主义改造。
    （二）社会主义事业不能长期建立在巨大集中的社会主义工业经济和最散漫落后的小商品农业经济两种不同的基础上。斯大林的这一论断，是依据马克思的再生产论从苏联当时的实际经济状况中分析出来的。社会主义大工业之所以能高速度的扩大发展，是由于它是按照扩大再生产的原则发展着，它有自己的积累，它的容量是逐年增加，而个体的小农业则是建立在简单的手工劳动基础之上，生产率很低，不但不能进行扩大再生产，有时甚至连单纯再生产也不能保持，一遇意外灾难，立刻陷入破产。工、农业中间的这种差别，说明它们根本不可能平衡发展。最后将会使工业本身的发展也成为问题。因为“农业乃是工业的基础，农业的增长，也就是工业化粮食基地及原料基地的增长。如果没有农业的相应发展，工业的长久发展客观上是不可能的”〔三〕。
    为了使农业也能实行积累，实行扩大再生产，我们就必须将小农经济改造成为社会主义集体农业。
    （三）农业集体化是消灭城乡对立的必然途径。在资本主义社会中，资产阶级通过各种手段对农民进行残酷的剥削，城乡对立关系达到了极端尖锐的阶段。苏联在社会主义建设的初期，城乡对立性的问题还仍然存在。但是社会主义政权是以工农联盟为基础的，它的任务就是消灭阶级、消灭一切剥削，把乡村和城市结成为一个经济的整体，使乡村与城市达到一致。可见这时城乡对立问题，只能是在一定时期内存在的问题。
    因此，作为城乡对立性问题内容之一的“剪刀形态”问题，也只能是一定时期内存在的问题。而且在社会主义社会里的“剪刀形态”问题和资本主义社会的“剪刀形态”，其性质也根本不同。在资本主义社会，资产阶级利用“剪刀差”的办法，向农民榨取高额利润，而社会主义社会条件下的“剪刀差”，则是为了迅速发展工业才不得已而采取的一种必要的然而是暂时的办法。同时这种办法所加于农民的负担，在农民生活不断改善的条件下，是完全可以负担得了的。右倾机会主义者不去了解这个道理，而嚷叫什么“军事封建剥削”什么“十月革命没有给农民丝毫东西”，这完全是无稽的谰言。
    斯大林说，农民正是由于获得了国家帮助，由于共同组织集体农庄的结果，劳动生产率大大提高，生产成本降低，农民出售谷物时能比从前有更多的收入。只这一点已可使农民的经济状况比十月革命前大为改善。如果集体农庄运动在城市的帮助之下，按已有速度发展下去，使农民的经济状况获得继续改善和提高，那么农民就自然会信任城市，自动提出“面向城市”的口号，城乡对立性也就自然消灭。这样，斯大林就把党所规划的消灭城乡对立性的道路，严格地和布哈林分子所主张的道路对立起来。布哈林分子所主张的道路，是尽量提高农产品的价格，恢复市场“常态”，允许完全的自由贸易，让富农在市场上自由玩弄价格。显然，这只便利于农村资本主义的发展，它不仅不能消灭城乡对立性，而且必然使之更加尖锐化。
    我国农业的社会主义改造，有某些特殊的历史条件，因而对富农经济可以采取限制其发展和逐步消灭的办法，不必采取剥夺的办法。但这决不是说我们就可以放松对富农的斗争。那些将被消灭的阶级为要挽救它的死亡的命运，必然要进行绝望的反抗。富农也决不例外。两年来全国各地富农的各种破坏活动，完全可以证明这一道理。
    同时我们还必须注意，我国也有各种反映富农阶级意识的观点和思想，虽然这些观点和思想还没有集中地形成一种理论体系。例如：
    一、在农业合作化运动中，有些富农向中农鼓吹“各干各的，互不妨碍”等谰言，这就是“维持现状”思想的一种表现。
    刘少奇同志在批评“维持现状”思想时说：“社会主义和资本主义两种相反的生产关系，在一个国家里面互不干扰地平行发展，是不可能的。”为什么不可能呢？第一、新的生产关系给生产力开辟发展的道路，而旧的生产关系却束缚着生产力的发展。这样不同的两种生产关系长期并存下去，必然导致生产陷入严重的不平衡状态，甚至导致国民经济的瓦解。在一国范围内是如此，在一个经济部门内也是如此。我国土地改革后几年来，由于个体经济在农业中占优势，已经发生农产品的供应跟不上国家建设需要的紧张情势。如果再让小农经济在农业里长期存在下去，那就不仅妨害农业本身生产力的发展，而且妨害着整个的经济建设事业了。第二、两种相反的生产关系背后站着利益相反的阶级，它们要求着相反的发展方向。这个道理，从农村里阶级斗争的具体情况可以看得十分清楚。现在广大有觉悟的劳动农民，由于认识了小农经济的脆弱性使他们仍然不能根本摆脱贫困，所以他们都积极地热烈地参加和发展农业生产合作社，走上社会主义建设道路。而不少的富农却感到发展农业生产合作社对他们的威胁，于是就从外面和里面千方百计地进行破坏。常常有些中农在他们的挑拨、拉拢，造谣、恐吓之下，不愿或不敢参加合作社，或中途离开合作社，甚至有些合作社被他们弄垮或弄得变质。富农的这种活动，严重地妨害着农业的社会主义改造。由此可见，“各干各的，互不妨碍”的富农言论，正是破坏农业合作化的一种活动，因此，要进行农业的社会主义改造，就必须驳斥富农阶级的这种谬论。
    二、有些人认为解放后农民的状况并没有什么改善，他们叫嚷着“农民负担还很重”。这种人俨然以农民利益代表者的姿态出现，要求立即彻底改善农民的生活。这种论调是把工人和农民生活，城市和乡村生活中间的某些不可避免的差异，加以夸大，要求充分满足农民的眼前的狭小利益，不管农民的长远的根本利益。这只会妨碍我们社会主义工业化的必要速度，延长资本主义的寿命。
    我们知道，解放后农民解除了封建地租剥削，取消了反动统治所加在他们身上的大量苛捐杂税，获得了政府的各种生产、救济贷款，实行互助合作等等。所有这些，已使大多数农民的生活状况比解放前获得改善，这是不能抹煞的事实。现在虽然有某种程度的负担，但这是建设社会主义所必需的。社会主义社会的建成，是不能不付以相当代价的。工人阶级在城市里发动劳动竞赛，提高生产效率，进行技术革新，以忘我的劳动精神，来建设社会主义工业；农民也应当忍耐某些暂时的困难，尽自己的力量来支援这一建设。只有社会主义工业建设不断获得胜利，农民生活才能得到改善。
    勿庸讳言，现在城乡之间是有矛盾的，这主要是社会主义大工业和小农经济之间的矛盾。社会主义工业的发展需要对城乡资本主义实行改造，而小农经济却有自发的资本主义倾向，并经常分泌着资本主义；社会主义工业建设需要有大量农产品的迅速供应，而小农经济的产品供应量小，增加的速度很慢；社会主义工业建设需要农作物有计划的发展，而分散的小农经济却进行着无计划的盲目生产。这一系列的矛盾是必须克服的，克服的道路只有一条，就是对农业进行社会主义的改造，使农业变成集体的、巨大的、机械化的农业。在农业的社会主义改造过程中，城市工人供给农村以大量的机器、拖拉机、技术人材和各种工业产品，这样就将使我国的工人阶级和农民间，城市和乡村间的关系日渐融洽。
    三、此外，还有所谓“买卖自由”的论调。这是和国家对农产品特别是粮食的统购统销政策相对抗的。抱有这种念头的人，认为统购统销干涉了他们的买卖自由，限制了他们的发展，说：“政府管得太宽，业不由主啦”。他们利用统购统销实际工作中的某些缺点，大肆造谣攻击。他们要求粮食市场上的完全自由，即所谓买卖数额自由，时间自由，地点自由，价格自由等。
    “买卖自由”这一要求，客观上反映富农对社会主义改造的反抗。在统购统销政策实施后，农村资本主义分子已不能利用粮食在市场上投机倒把了，不能利用粮食对贫苦农民进行高利剥削了。所以某些富农分子的叫嚣与反抗是必然的。
    粮食自由市场之存在，乃是社会主义工业化、农业的社会主义改造和工农联盟事业所不能容许的。因为，如果允许粮食有完全自由的市场，富农和投机商人就可以囤积居奇，伺机任意提高粮价，粮价提高的结果，其他作为工业原料的农作物的价格也不得不随之提高，并且工人的工资也不得不随之提高，于是工业品的成本和价格也就不得不随之提高，这样就必然使工业品的市场日趋缩小，使社会主义的工业无法发展。如果允许粮食有完全自由的市场，就等于放纵农村资本主义的发展，而农村资本主义势力继续发展，就要使农业的集体化无法实现。如果允许有粮食的完全自由市场，农产品和工业品的价格，就要沿着互相牵连的圈子，循环往复不断上涨，不断涨价的结果，城市得不到廉价的农产品，农民得不到廉价的工业品，工农联盟的巩固也将因此受到严重的威胁。
    斯大林在“论苏联土地政策底几个问题”中着重指出：这种反马克思主义的富农的理论之所以能够在当时公开散布，主要是因为苏联当时的理论思想工作赶不上社会主义经济建设的实践的要求，因此，在实践成绩与理论思想发展之间产生了距离，予阶级敌人以可乘之机。
    现在，我国在社会主义建设方面获得了很大的成绩，但我们的理论思想工作却是相当薄弱的，落后于实践的要求。而且，理论思想界长期对资产阶级思想缺乏斗争，甚至有些人对资产阶级思想采取投降主义态度，这是非常值得我们警惕的事情。因此，我们一定要加强理论思想工作，对资产阶级思想进行不调和的斗争。只有这样，我们才能克服困难，顺利地过渡到社会主义社会。
