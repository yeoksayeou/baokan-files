Xinhua News Agency, December 28th, Paris: The French National Assembly reconvened at the Palais Bourbon on the 27th to continue debating the Paris Agreements and held a vote of confidence on the Mendes-France government regarding Articles 2 and 3 of the draft law ratifying the Paris Agreements. Articles 2 and 3 stipulate West Germany's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the so-called "end of the occupation regime" in West Germany. All members of parliament attended the meeting. Not a single seat was empty in the galleries for reporters, guests, and members of the public.

    A tense atmosphere hung over the Palais Bourbon. In the three days of recess after the National Assembly rejected the most important Article 1 of the Paris Agreements—the protocol on arming West Germany within the framework of the "Western European Union"—on the morning of the 24th, an extremely fierce struggle took place between the forces attempting to salvage the Paris Agreements and those continuing to oppose them.

    The United States and British governments frantically and openly exerted crude pressure on France to change its decision to refuse to arm West Germany. According to a Reuters report on the 27th, in the days since the 24th, U.S. President Eisenhower in Augusta and Secretary of State Dulles in Washington had fifty phone conversations to discuss the matter. Frequent consultations also took place between the United States and Britain. From Washington, Augusta, and London, a large number of blackmailing and intimidating messages were sent to France.

    Relying on the crude intimidation from the United States and Britain, Mendes-France also engaged in intense behind-the-scenes activities these past few days, attempting to induce some parliamentarians to change their stance and support the Paris Agreements. According to information revealed on the 27th, the Mendes-France government held negotiations on the 25th with some Gaullist and Socialist parliamentarians who had voted against arming West Germany. Apparently as a result of Mendes-France's activities, the steering committee of the National Center of Independents, composed of several right-wing party groups in France, demanded on the 27th that their parliamentarians not vote against the Paris Agreements.

    In recent days, broad sections of French patriotic forces have strongly opposed the Paris Agreements. On the very day the National Assembly reconvened on the 27th, two thousand people gathered outside the National Assembly, holding placards protesting the rearmament of West Germany. About a thousand representatives from various social groups submitted petitions to the National Assembly protesting the rearmament of West Germany. According to a United Press report, the protest crowd gathered outside the National Assembly was the largest since the establishment of the Fourth Republic of France after the war.

    The impact of the fierce struggle between the two forces was clearly reflected in the debates and votes in the National Assembly on the 27th.

    During the debate, Communist parliamentarian Piéfferal fiercely criticized the United States and Britain for forcing the French parliament to ratify the Paris Agreements. He pointed out that the French people did not want the Paris Agreements, and that the National Assembly's refusal to ratify these agreements was in line with France's highest interests and was a major contribution to negotiations with the Soviet Union.

    Some right-wing parliamentarians also spoke out against arming West Germany. Parliamentarian Vallon asked everyone to vote against Articles 2 and 3 of the draft law on ratifying the Paris Agreements and against confidence in the government. He emphasized that many representatives of the French people were particularly concerned about the plan to absorb West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Democratic Social Resistance Alliance parliamentarian Gaière said: As a Frenchman, my sacred duty is to vote against arming West Germany, which is to say, against confidence in the government. He pointed out that the policies adopted by Mendes-France in Geneva opened the way for broad international negotiations, while the policies of the London Conference, which laid the foundation for the Paris Agreements, closed the door to negotiations, intensified the arms race, and exacerbated competition within the Western camp. He expressed anger at the threats from the United States and Britain, saying that the British Foreign Office's statement showed that the Western allies regarded France as a vassal state of the North Atlantic Alliance.

    Under the threats and inducements of the United States, Britain, and Mendes-France, some right-wing parliamentarians who voted against arming West Germany or abstained on the 24th showed signs of wavering or changed their attitude.

    Parliamentarians Mutet and Lamaroni reproached Mendes-France for asking the parliament to vote on Article 2 of the draft law after Article 1 was rejected.

    Mendes-France spoke. He stubbornly argued that he was legally permitted to do so. He admitted that, for the French people, "rearming West Germany is undoubtedly painful." However, he repeated various arguments used by the United States and Britain to intimidate France, threatening parliamentarians to support the Paris Agreements on arming West Germany. He said it was necessary to maintain the North Atlantic Alliance. He stubbornly argued that the United States and Britain might arm West Germany separately regardless of France, and that rejecting the Paris Agreements would cause France to lose its international standing.

    Parliamentarian Palewski pointed out that Mendes-France's speech was unconvincing, especially regarding the point that the United States and Britain would arm West Germany on their own. He said that after the Paris Agreements came into effect, four-power negotiations would be extremely difficult, and that the best way to prevent the threat of war was for the four powers to meet and jointly resolve the German issue.

    Next, the parliament held a vote of confidence in the government regarding Articles 2 and 3 of the draft law on ratifying the Paris Agreements. The result of the vote was that the motion of confidence passed with 289 votes to 251.

    Mendes-France then asked Palewski and Rousset-Lacordaire to withdraw the two amendments they had proposed, which the government opposed, regarding the postponement of implementation after the Paris Agreements were ratified. He once again invoked the argument of "solidarity of Western countries" to intimidate parliamentarians, saying that there would be an international conference in May, attempting to deceive those parliamentarians who demanded negotiations with the Soviet Union.

    Palewski and Rousset-Lacordaire withdrew the two amendments. The originally planned vote of confidence on rejecting these amendments was therefore not held. Next, the National Assembly raised its hands to vote and passed another amendment proposed by Palewski, which was supported by the government, stipulating that the instruments of ratification of the various treaties of the Paris Agreements (including the Saar Agreement) should be exchanged simultaneously.

    Mendes-France then requested a second reading vote on Article 1 of the Paris Agreements—the protocol on arming West Germany—in an attempt to change the National Assembly's decision to reject Article 1.

    According to the rules of the French National Assembly, the National Assembly recessed for one hour to allow the Foreign Affairs Committee to express its opinion on the second reading vote on Article 1 of the Paris Agreements. The Foreign Affairs Committee voted 20 to 19 (with four abstentions) against holding a second reading vote on Article 1 of the Paris Agreements.

    The Foreign Affairs Committee's adoption of this decision unfavorable to Mendes-France deepened the concerns of French government officials about the second reading vote. According to Reuters, Mendes-France government officials admitted that the result of the vote on Articles 2 and 3 of the Paris Agreements on the 27th "does not mean that the government will naturally win the most important vote on the issue of rearming Germany." The Reuters report went on to say that it was believed that in the vote on Article 1 of the Paris Agreements concerning the arming of West Germany, "the psychology of certain parliamentarians fearing being accused of 'reviving the Wehrmacht' seems to play a greater role, especially in the Paris Agreements where (this) specifically mentions the part about West Germany establishing twelve divisions."

    After the National Assembly reconvened, Mendes-France requested a vote of confidence in the government on the entire Paris Agreements except for Article 1. Next, he also requested a vote of confidence in the government separately on the part of the Paris Agreements concerning the arming of West Germany. He hoped to use the vote of confidence to coerce parliamentarians into supporting the Paris Agreements.

    These two votes will be held on the 29th.

    法国国民议会复会继续辩论巴黎协定问题
    反对和支持巴黎协定的力量斗争非常激烈
    【新华社二十八日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会二十七日在波旁宫复会，继续辩论巴黎协定问题，并就批准巴黎协定法案第二条和第三条举行对孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府的信任投票，第二条和第三条是规定让西德参加北大西洋集团以及所谓在西德“结束占领制度”。全体议员都出席了会议。记者、来宾和社会各界人士的旁听席上没有一个空位。
    紧张的气氛笼罩着波旁宫。在国民议会二十四日清晨否决巴黎协定中最主要的第一条——在“西欧联盟”范围内武装西德的议定书以后休会的三天中，企图挽救巴黎协定和再接再厉反对巴黎协定两种力量间进行了十分激烈的斗争。
    美国和英国政府慌张地公然向法国施加粗暴的压力，要法国国民议会改变拒绝武装西德的决定。据路透社二十七日报道，自二十四日以来的几天里，在奥古斯大的美国总统艾森豪威尔和在华盛顿的国务卿杜勒斯通了五十次电话进行商谈。美国和英国间也频频进行商谈。从华盛顿、奥古斯大和伦敦，大量地发出了各种各样对法国的讹诈和恫吓。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯依靠着美国和英国的粗暴恫吓，这几天中也紧张地进行幕后活动，诱迫一些议员改变态度而支持巴黎协定。据二十七日透露出来的消息说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府二十五日同一些投票反对武装西德的戴高乐派和社会党议员举行了谈判。显然是孟戴斯—弗朗斯活动的结果，由法国几个右翼政党集团组成的独立派全国中心指导委员会在二十七日要求它们的议员不要投票反对巴黎协定。
    这几天，法国广大阶层爱国力量强烈反对巴黎协定。就在二十七日国民议会复会的一天，有两千人集会在国民议会的外面，他们手持着抗议重新武装西德的标语牌。约有一千名各社会团体的代表向国民议会递交抗议重新武装西德的请愿书。据合众社消息说，集合在国民议会外的抗议人群是战后法兰西第四共和国成立以来最多的一次。
    两种力量激烈斗争的影响，明显地反映在二十七日国民议会的辩论和投票中。
    在辩论中，共产党议员皮埃拉尔严厉抨击美国和英国强迫法国议会批准巴黎协定。他指出，法国人民不要巴黎协定，国民议会拒绝批准这些协定是符合法国的最高利益的，而且对于同苏联谈判是一个重大贡献。
    一些右翼议员也发言表示反对武装西德。议员伐隆要求大家投票反对关于批准巴黎协定的法案的第二条和第三条，反对信任政府。他强调指出，法国人民的许多代表都对吸收西德加入北大西洋公约组织的计划特别感到忧虑。民主社会抵抗联盟议员盖埃说：作为一个法国人，我的天职就是投票反对武装西德，也就是反对信任政府。他指出，孟戴斯—弗朗斯在日内瓦采取的政策为广泛的国际谈判打开了道路，而奠定巴黎协定基础的伦敦会议的政策却关闭了谈判的大门，加紧了扩军，并且加剧了西方阵营内部的竞争。他对美国和英国的威胁表示愤怒，他说，英国外交部的声明表明：西方盟国把法国当作北大西洋联盟的一个附庸国。
  　在美国、英国和孟戴斯—弗朗斯的威胁诱迫下，也有某些在二十四日投票反对武装西德或者弃权的右翼议员表现出动摇，或者改变了态度。
    议员缪特和拉马罗尼责备孟戴斯—弗朗斯在法案的第一条被否决后还要求议会表决法案的第二条。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯发言。他硬说，他这样做是法律允许的。他承认，对法国人来说，“重新武装西德无疑是痛苦的”。但是，他重复着美国和英国恐吓法国的各种论调，威胁议员支持关于武装西德的巴黎协定。他说必须保持北大西洋联盟。他硬说美国和英国可能不顾法国而单独武装西德，硬说拒绝巴黎协定就会使法国丧失国际地位。
    议员巴列夫斯基发言指出，孟戴斯—弗朗斯的发言不能使人信服，特别是关于美国和英国径自武装西德一点。他说，巴黎协定生效后，四国谈判就极端困难，而阻止战争威胁临头的最好办法却是四国会谈共同解决德国问题。
    接着，议会就关于批准巴黎协定的法案第二条和第三条进行对政府的信任投票。投票结果，信任案以二百八十九票对二百五十一票通过。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯接着要求巴列夫斯基和鲁斯多诺—拉果收回他们提出的、为政府所反对的两个关于在批准巴黎协定后延期实施的修正案。他再一次搬出“西方国家的团结”的论调来恫吓议员，说什么在五月要举行国际会议，企图来欺骗那些要求同苏联谈判的议员。
    巴列夫斯基和鲁斯多诺—拉果撤回了这两个修正案。原拟举行的关于拒绝这些修正案的信任投票因此没有举行。接着国民议会举手表决通过了政府赞成的巴列夫斯基的另一个修正案，规定同时交换巴黎协定各项条约（包括萨尔协定在内）批准书。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯然后要求就巴黎协定第一条——武装西德议定书进行二读表决，企图来改变国民议会已经作出的否决第一条的决定。
    按照法国国民议会规则，国民议会休会一小时，让外交委员会开会对二读表决巴黎协定第一条表示意见。外交委员会以二十票对十九票（四票弃权）反对就巴黎协定第一条进行二读表决。
    外交委员会通过这种对孟戴斯—弗朗斯不利的决定，加深了法国政府人士对二读表决的担忧。据路透社报道，孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府人士承认，二十七日就巴黎协定第二条和第三条表决的结果“并不意味着政府会自然而然地赢得就重新武装德国问题所进行的最重要的一次表决”。路透社消息接着说，人们认为，在就巴黎协定关于武装西德的第一条进行表决时，“某些议员担心被指责‘使（德国）国防军复活’的心理似乎起更大的作用，特别是在巴黎协定中（这个）具体提到西德建立十二个师的部分”。
    在国民议会复会后，孟戴斯—弗朗斯要求就除第一条外的整个巴黎协定举行对政府的信任投票。接着，他又要求单独就巴黎协定中关于武装西德的部分举行对政府的信任投票。他指望用信任投票来要挟议员支持巴黎协定。
    这两项投票将在二十九日举行。
