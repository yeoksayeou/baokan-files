To the Editor:

    While the people of the whole country are warmly concerned about the resettlement of disaster victims, certain districts in Fanchang County, Anhui Province, have adopted an extremely indifferent and erroneous attitude towards disaster victims transferred from Wuwei County.

    Fanchang County is a mountainous area, separated from Wuwei County only by the Yangtze River. In August this year, after the Yangtze River levee at An'ding Street, Wuwei County, breached, according to the instructions of the Wuhu Special District, more than 20,000 disaster victims from Baiwei, Niwei, Yaogou, and Heba districts along the river in Wuwei County were transferred to Digang District and Jiuxian District in Fanchang County for resettlement. In order to resettle the disaster victims, the Wuhu Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuhu Special Commissioner's Office repeatedly instructed Fanchang County to make preparations in advance, and allocated 50 million yuan to Jiuxian District as resettlement expenses, and sent a working group to provide assistance. However, due to the lack of concern for the suffering of disaster victims from other areas by some responsible cadres in Jiuxian District and Digang District, many difficulties were added to the lives of the disaster victims. After the disaster victims from Wuwei County were transferred to Fanchang, they had no preparations whatsoever. Jiuxian District did not supply grain to the disaster victims from other areas, and told the disaster victims: "If you want to buy grain, Wuwei County is responsible. The grain here is not for you." Not only could the disaster victims not buy grain with money, but they couldn't even find a place to live. Although Liu Qingfeng, Commissioner of Wuhu Special District, personally wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Jiuxian District Party Committee and the District Head, asking them to be responsible for setting up a disaster victim reception station and building sheds for more than 1,000 people, they said that they could not buy bamboo, thatch, and reed mats (in fact, these materials were not lacking at that time, they just didn't go to purchase them). In this way, because the disaster victims did not have proper housing, the number of sick people increased day by day. The Jiuxian District Health Center had no sympathy for the patients. They rigidly emphasized "system" and "medical expenses cannot be reimbursed," and regardless of how serious the condition was, they simply refused the requests of the disaster victims. Some disaster victims planned to buy materials themselves to build thatched sheds, but not only did they fail to provide them, but they also prohibited the disaster victims from buying them at the cooperative, so private merchants took the opportunity to raise prices, and the disaster victims suffered greatly. In Jiuxian District and Digang District, the price of rice straw per bundle rose from 12,000 yuan to 22,000 yuan, the price of bamboo per bundle rose from 15,000 yuan to 38,000 yuan, and the price of firewood also rose from 6,000 yuan to 15,000 yuan per bundle. When the cadres of Wuwei County raised their opinions to the District Head of Jiuxian District, he said: "We can't manage so much, this is a matter for the masses themselves." Allowing the phenomenon of soaring prices to continue.

    The departmentalism of the leading authorities in Jiuxian District and Digang District is extremely serious. They used the excuse that some areas in the local area were also affected by the disaster to shirk their responsibilities, saying: "We are also disaster areas! We also have to take care of our disaster victims!" According to the regulations of the higher authorities, the local government should allocate barren mountains and barren land for the disaster victims to reclaim for production, but they said: "Where can we find barren land for you! We have to reclaim it ourselves!" They allocated a large amount of good land to the local disaster victims, but they could not finish reclaiming it. After repeated requests, they reluctantly gave the disaster victims from other areas a bit of hillside with many stones, and the disaster victims spent a lot of effort to reclaim it, but the harvest was very small. It is even more noteworthy that there were 1,023 disaster victims transferred from Wuwei County to Digang Town. According to the instructions of the higher authorities, 40% of the relief funds in October should be used to relieve the disaster victims in Wuwei County. They insisted that there were only 300 disaster victims in Wuwei County, but they relieved a large amount of money to the local disaster victims. The cadres of Wuwei County requested a reinvestigation, but they said: "We don't have that much time."

    The disaster victims of Wuwei County have lived in Jiuxian District and Digang District for three or four months, and not only have they not received material assistance, but they have not even received spiritual comfort. The district governments of these two districts have never organized condolences to the disaster victims.

    The erroneous attitude of Jiuxian District and Digang District towards the disaster victims of Wuwei County has been able to exist for a long time without being corrected, which is inseparable from the bureaucratic attitude of the leaders of Fanchang County. During this period, members of the Fanchang County Party Committee often helped in these two districts, but they turned a blind eye to these phenomena and did not ask about them. The cadres of Wuwei County and the comrades of the Special District Working Group have repeatedly reported to them the serious shortcomings in the resettlement of disaster victims in Jiuxian District and Digang District. They either turned a deaf ear to it, or promised to check and correct it, but there was no practical action afterwards. This phenomenon cannot be allowed to exist, and I request the relevant parties to check and deal with this issue.

### 安徽省繁昌县旧县区对待外地灾民的错误态度

    安徽省繁昌县旧县区对待外地灾民的错误态度编辑同志：
    当全国人民热忱关怀灾民生活安置的时候，安徽省繁昌县某些区对无为县转移去的灾民采取了极其冷漠的错误态度。
    繁昌县是个多山的地区，和无为县仅隔着一道长江。今年八月间，无为县安定街长江大堤决口以后，根据芜湖专署的指示，无为县沿江的白?、泥?、姚沟、河坝等区有二万多灾民转移到繁昌县荻港区和旧县区安置。中共芜湖地委会和芜湖专署为了安置灾民，事先一再指示繁昌县做好准备工作，并拨发了五千万元给旧县区做为安置灾民的费用，派了工作组进行帮助。但是，由于旧县区和荻港区的一些负责干部不关心外地灾民的疾苦，因而给灾民生活上增加了很多困难。无为县的灾民转移到繁昌以后，他们什么也没有准备。旧县区对外来灾民不供应粮食，并对灾民说：“你们要买粮食由无为县负责，这里的粮食不是卖给你们吃的。”灾民不仅有钱买不到粮食，甚至要找个住处也没有。芜湖专区刘青峰专员虽曾亲自写信给旧县区委书记和区长，要他们负责设立灾民接待站，盖一千多人住的棚子，他们却说买不到毛竹、房草和芦席等材料（实际上当时这些器材并不缺，只是他们不去收购）。这样，灾民们因为没有适当的住处，生病的人日见增多。旧县区卫生所对于病人毫无同情心，他们死板地强调“制度”“医疗费无法报销”，不管病情多么严重，一味拒绝灾民们的恳求。有的灾民打算自己买材料搭草棚，他们不但不设法供应，反而禁止灾民到合作社去购买，于是私商乘机抬高市价，灾民吃亏很大。在旧县区和荻港区，稻草每担由一万二千元涨到两万二千元，毛竹每担由一万五千元涨到三万八千元，烧柴也由每担六千元涨到一万五千元。无为县的干部向旧县区区长提出意见，他说：“我们管不了这许多，这是群众自己的事。”任凭物价暴涨的现象继续下去。
    旧县区和荻港区领导方面的本位主义是极端严重的。他们借口当地有部分地区受灾，就推卸责任说：“我们也是灾区啊！我们还要管我们的灾民！”按照上级的规定组织灾民开荒生产，当地政府应该拨给荒山、荒地，但是他们却说：“哪有荒地给你们！我们自己还要开呢！”他们把大批好的地划给本地灾民开，结果开不完。经过多次要求，勉强给了外地灾民一点石头很多的山坡，灾民们费了很大力气开垦，收获很少。更值得注意的是无为县转移到荻港镇的灾民有一千零二十三人，按上级指示十月份的救济款要百分之四十救济无为县的灾民。他们硬说无为县的灾民只有三百人，却把大量款项救济了本地的灾民。无为县的干部要求重新调查，他们却说：“我们哪有这许多工夫。”
    无为县的灾民在旧县区和荻港区先后住了三、四个月，不但没有得到他们在物质上的帮助，就连精神上的安慰也没有，这两个区的区政府从来就没有组织过对灾民的慰问。
    旧县区和荻港区对无为县灾民的错误态度所以能够长期存在而没有得到纠正，是和繁昌县领导方面的官僚主义态度分不开的。这期间，中共繁昌县委会经常有县委委员在这两个区帮助工作，然而他们对于这些现象却熟视无睹，不加过问。无为县的干部和专区工作组的同志曾多次向他们反映过旧县区和荻港区在安置灾民工作中的严重缺点，他们不是听之任之，就是满口答应检查纠正，事后并没有实际行动。这种现象是不能容许存在的，我要求有关方面检查处理这个问题。
