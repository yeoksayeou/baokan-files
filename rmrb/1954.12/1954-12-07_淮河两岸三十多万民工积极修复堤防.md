More than 300,000 laborers on both banks of the Huai River are actively repairing dikes.

The winter Huai River harnessing projects in various areas along the river have fully commenced, with over 300,000 laborers working on the dikes. The main task of this winter's Huai River harnessing project is to repair the dikes. During the summer flood season this year, the Huai River dikes withstood an exceptionally large flood unseen in a century, ensuring the safety of cities along the river such as Bengbu and Huainan, and greatly reducing the extent of farmland affected in the Huai River areas of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces. However, because the dikes were subjected to long-term impact from the extraordinarily large flood, many places need to be repaired and reinforced. To this end, the Huai River Harnessing Committee has decided that during the construction period this winter and spring, the Huai River dikes should be restored to the state they were in before this year's extraordinarily large flood, and some dikes will be further raised and thickened on the basis of restoring the original dikes.

Farmers in the Huai River area have seen that the Huai River harnessing project has greatly reduced this year's flood damage, and the laborers working on the dikes have very high enthusiasm. In Henan Province, the work efficiency of the dike restoration project is generally around 2.5 cubic meters per person per day. In Anhui Province, the work efficiency of dike restoration by laborers in Funan, Yingshang, and Fengtai counties is approximately 2.48 cubic meters per person per day, which has reached the standard of the predetermined quota. In the Huai River dredging project in Su County, Lingbi, and Si County, although encountering many difficulties, the work efficiency of the laborers still reached 87.8% of the predetermined quota.

    淮河两岸三十多万民工积极修复堤防
    沿淮各地的冬季治淮工程已全面开工，上堤民工达三十多万人。今年冬季治淮工程主要是修复堤防。今年夏汛期间淮河堤防抗拒了百年以来少有的特大洪水，保证了蚌埠、淮南等沿淮城市的安全，大大减轻了河南、安徽、江苏等省沿淮地区农田的受灾程度。但由于堤防经受特大洪水的长期冲击，很多地方需要培修加固。为此，治淮委员会决定在今冬明春施工期间，要把淮河堤防修复到今年特大洪水以前的状态，部分堤防并将在恢复原堤的基础上再加高培厚。
    沿淮地区农民看到了治淮工程大大减轻了今年的水灾，上堤民工劳动热情很高。河南省复堤工程的工作效率每人每天一般达二点五公方左右。安徽省阜南、颍上、凤台等县民工复堤的工作效率每人每天约二点四八公方，已达到预订定额的标准。宿县、灵璧、泗县等县民工在淮河疏浚工程中，虽然遭遇到重重困难，工作效率仍达到预订定额的百分之八十七点八。　（新华社）
