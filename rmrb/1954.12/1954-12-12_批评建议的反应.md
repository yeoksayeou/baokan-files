Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

The General Bureau of Maritime Transport Decides to Handle Five Vessels搁置 in Shanghai

Reader Xu Zhenjia from Shanghai wrote to reflect that five dredgers and small vessels taken over by the Shanghai Port Authority in 1953 had been lying on the beach at the mouth of the Huangpu River, not being utilized. After inspection by the General Bureau of Maritime Transport of the Ministry of Communications, the situation was confirmed. These five vessels were officially taken over by the Shanghai Port Authority in August last year, and it was originally decided to allocate them to departments in need; however, because there were no recipients, the Shanghai Port Authority maintained and kept them. In September this year, cadres from the Shanghai Port Authority in Beijing verbally proposed to the General Bureau of Maritime Transport that they intended to retain two vessels for use, scrap one, and requested the General Bureau of Maritime Transport to assist in transferring the remaining two. However, the problem was not resolved after the discussion.

After receiving Xu Zhenjia's letter, the General Bureau of Maritime Transport reconsidered the handling of these five vessels and decided that two of them would be officially retained by the Shanghai Port Authority; the one to be scrapped would be reported for verification after detailed technical appraisal by the Shanghai Port Authority; and the remaining two vessels would be technically inspected by the Shanghai Port Authority in preparation for external transfer. They also reviewed the shortcomings in the past enterprise management where they did not actively consider how to tap the potential of existing equipment, and are determined to improve their work in the future and overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible for asset management.

The Handan Prefectural Committee Decides to Strengthen Leadership Over the Work of Cultural Centers and Stations

A letter from the office of the Handan Local Committee of the Communist Party of China: We welcome the criticism of our region's cultural centers and stations work in the People's Daily on November 14th. In order to strengthen the leadership over the work of cultural centers and stations and quickly change the backward situation in our region's cultural centers and stations work, the Prefectural Committee has decided to take the following measures:

I. Party committees at all levels should regularly discuss and study cultural work, promptly solve the main problems existing in the work, and frequently and promptly assign tasks to the cultural sections and cultural centers and stations, and conduct inspections and supervision.

II. The organization departments of the Party committees are responsible for quickly staffing the cadres (especially leading cadres) of the cultural sections and cultural centers and stations in each county, and making appropriate adjustments where necessary.

III. Pay attention to establishing the regular work of cultural sections and cultural centers and stations cadres, so that they can serve the central work through cultural propaganda work, in order to exert greater propaganda effects, and correct the phenomenon of arbitrarily transferring cultural centers and stations cadres to do fixed village and other work.

IV. Plan to improve the policy level and professional level of the staff of cultural sections and cultural centers and stations, and strengthen the study of on-the-job cadres. Adopt short-term training, organize demonstrations and other methods to improve professional level.

Finally, the Prefectural Committee instructed the relevant departments to convene a joint meeting of cultural sections and museum directors of each county to specifically explain to them the guidelines, policies, business scope, work tasks and work methods.

Beijing Company of China Food Company is Determined to Improve Food Hygiene Work

A letter from the Beijing Company of China Food Company: The "Reader's Letters" page on November 21st published Comrade Ling Dong's criticism of our company's poor hygiene work. This criticism has helped us to more deeply realize the important significance of doing a good job in food hygiene work in our thinking. In order to improve and improve our work in a timely manner, we convened a meeting of responsible comrades of all affiliated units on November 25th, focusing on reviewing the past situation of insufficient attention to hygiene work, pointing out that in the future, business work and hygiene work must be combined, strengthen the storage and inspection of commodities, and in particular, strictly prevent the sale of corrupt and deteriorated commodities to protect the people's health.

The reason why our company's hygiene work was not done well in the past, from the leadership's point of view, is mainly that there were many calls and many arrangements, but few inspections and less specific help; in addition, there was also the situation of grabbing a handful when there were hygiene inspections and loosening up after the inspections. In the future, we guarantee to change this situation so that hygiene work can be regularized.

We have also put forward some improvement measures for various specific tasks. The meat department has decided to implement a regional, group-based responsible system and a fixed-staff, fixed-quota, fixed-time, fixed-quantity system for livestock (pig, cattle, sheep) breeding work, so that livestock can eat well, eat enough, and reduce disease and death. In addition to strengthening packaging and quality inspection of fresh and live commodities, each business unit is also responsible for assigning a special person to be responsible for storage, and implementing a regional, zone-based, and section-based responsible system. When selling fish, we must take the initiative to encourage customers to add ice to prevent spoilage. In the operation of fresh eggs, we must also pay further attention to improvement.

The Central South Branch of the Nonferrous Metals Bureau Supply and Marketing Department Inspects Work Through the Overpayment of Goods Event

A letter from the Supply and Marketing Department of the Central South Branch of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration: Comrade Binglin's criticism of our department's over-remittance of payment published on the "Reader's Letters" page on November 28th is correct. We overpaid the Longshan Mine Pharmaceutical Factory in Changping County by more than 200 million yuan, and it has not been discovered for more than a year after repeated inquiries from the payment unit and the clearing of transactions at the end of the year. This shows that our department's business system is chaotic, the contact between various units is not close, and the sense of responsibility of some cadres is not strong. The fundamental reason is weak leadership, insufficient organization of various business tasks, and insufficient political and ideological education of cadres. In order to learn from the criticism and improve our work, we have decided to use this incident as a typical example to organize all relevant business departments to conduct a general inspection of the work. In addition to studying and improving the work based on the problems found in the inspection, the results of the inspection will also be announced at the cadre meeting to educate all staff. The accounting department should clear up the claims and debts and accumulated current accounts in order to discover and solve similar problems. Now the business inspection and account checking work has been launched, and a general cadre meeting will be held soon.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    海运管理总局决定处理搁置在上海的五艘船只
    上海市读者许振家来信反映，上海港务局在一九五三年接管的五艘挖泥船和小轮船一直躺在黄浦江口的海滩上，没有被利用。经交通部海运管理总局检查，证明情况属实。这五艘船在去年八月间由上海港务局正式接管，原决定调拨给需要的部门使用；但因为没有承受对象，就由上海港务局维护保管着。今年九月间，上海港务局来北京的干部曾口头向海运管理总局提出，准备留用两艘、报废一艘，其余两艘请海运管理总局协助外调。但是谈过以后问题并没有得到处理。
    海运管理总局接到许振家的来信后，对这五只船的处理办法重新作了考虑，决定其中两艘由上海港务局正式留用；准备报废的一艘由上海港务局详加技术鉴定后报核；其余两船由上海港务局作技术检查，准备外调。他们还对过去企业管理中没有积极主动地考虑如何发挥现有设备潜力的缺点进行了检讨，决心今后改进工作，克服资产管理中的无人负责现象。
    邯郸地委决定加强对文化馆、站工作的领导
    中共邯郸地方委员会办公室来信：十一月十四日人民日报对我区文化馆、站工作的批评，我们极表欢迎。为了加强对文化馆、站工作的领导，迅速改变目前我区文化馆、站工作方面的落后状况，地委会决定采取如下措施：
    一、各级党委要定期讨论和研究文化工作，及时解决工作中存在的主要问题，经常地及时地向文化科和文化馆、站交代任务并进行检查督促。
    二、责成党委组织部门把各县文化科及文化馆、站的干部（特别是领导干部）迅速配齐，需要调整的应加以适当的调整。
    三、注意建立文化科和文化馆、站干部的经常工作，使他们通过文化宣传工作来为中心工作服务，以发挥更大的宣传效果，纠正随便抽调文化馆、站干部做固定村等工作的现象。
    四、有计划地提高文化科和文化馆、站工作人员的政策水平和业务水平，加强在职干部的学习。采用短期训练，组织观摩等方式提高业务水平。
    最后，地委责成有关部门专门召开一次各县文化科、馆长联席会议，具体地向他们交代方针政策、业务范围、工作任务和工作方法。
    中国食品公司北京市公司决心改进食品卫生工作
    中国食品公司北京市公司来信：十一月二十一日“读者来信专页”刊载了凌冬同志对我公司卫生工作做得不好的批评。这次批评，帮助我们在思想上更深刻地认识到做好食品卫生工作的重要意义。为了及时改进和提高工作，我们在十一月二十五日召开所属各单位负责同志会议，着重检查了过去对卫生工作重视不够的情况，指出今后必须使业务工作和卫生工作结合起来，加强对商品的保管、检查，特别应该严格防止出售腐败变质商品，以保障人民身体健康。
    过去我公司卫生工作所以做得不好，从领导方面来检查，主要是号召多，布置多，而检查少，具体帮助更少；此外还存在着遇有卫生检查就抓一把，检查过去就松了劲的情况。今后我们保证要改变这种情况，使卫生工作能作到经常化。
    我们对各项具体工作也提出了一些改进办法。肉食部对牲畜（猪、牛、羊）的饲养工作决定实行分区、分组负责制和定员、定额、定时、定量制度，使牲畜吃得好，吃得饱，减少病伤死亡。对鲜、活商品，除加强包装和质量检查外，并责成各营业单位设专人负责保管，实行分区、分片、分段负责制。在出售鱼类时，我们要主动动员顾客加冰，以防腐坏。在经营鲜蛋方面，我们也要进一步注意改进。
    有色金属局中南分局供销处通过重付货款事件检查工作
    有色金属工业管理局中南分局供销处来信：十一月二十八日“读者来信专页”所刊炳麟同志对我处重汇货款的批评是正确的。我们给昌平县龙山矿药厂付重了二亿多元货款，一年多来经过付款单位多次查询和年终决算时的往来清理还没有发现。这说明我处业务制度混乱，各单位间联系不密切以及部分干部工作责任心不强。而其根本原因则是领导薄弱，对各项业务工作组织得不够严密，对干部的政治思想教育做得不充分。为了从批评中吸取教训，改进工作，我们决定用这个事件作典型，组织各有关业务部门普遍检查一次工作，除根据检查中发现的问题来研究改进工作外，并把检查结果在干部大会上宣布，以教育全体工作人员；会计部门则应清理债权债务和积压的往来账，以求发现和解决类似问题。现在业务检查和查账工作已经展开，不久就可以召开全体干部大会。
