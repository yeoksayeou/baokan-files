Sell Two Hundred More Jin of Grain
Farmer Dong Yongtong, Hesheng Township, Jiexiu County, Shanxi Province

After the land reform, my family was allocated nineteen mu of land. It stands to reason that the grain we harvested should have been enough to eat, but because we had a weak foundation, we couldn't afford fertilizer, so the grain we harvested was still not abundant.

In those days, if we didn't have enough to eat, we had to borrow at high interest rates. But the more we borrowed at high interest rates, the less we had to eat. Last summer, we harvested four shi of wheat, and half of it went to repaying high-interest loans, including the principal and interest. By the time we planted autumn wheat, my family didn't even have wheat seeds. Later, thanks to the government lending us one hundred jin of wheat seeds, we were able to plant the wheat. The credit cooperative also gave me a low-interest loan to buy food and take care of our lives. Otherwise, we would have been cut by the knife of high-interest loans again.

This year, when we were preparing for spring plowing and sowing, my land was short of fertilizer. The government entrusted the supply and marketing cooperative to implement advance grain and cotton purchases from farmers. I signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to pre-sell one hundred jin of grain and one hundred jin of cotton. I used the 80,000 yuan deposit to buy fertilizer and apply it to the land. In addition, this year's rainfall was good, and by the autumn harvest, my 2.7 mu of fertilized land yielded 4.5 shi of grain.

I know that the government's policy of unified purchase and sale is firstly to support national industrialization, and secondly to protect the interests of farmers, so that we will not suffer the hardship of exploitation by unscrupulous merchants and high-interest loans again. Therefore, I fully support the government's policy of unified purchase and sale. During this year's summer harvest, my wife and I estimated the harvest: after paying the public grain and keeping the seeds, we could sell 500 jin of grain to the state this year, and we would have white flour to eat during the New Year. Now, I am preparing to sell another 200 jin of autumn grain to the state.

### 再多卖二百斤粮食

    再多卖二百斤粮食
    山西省介休县河生乡农民　董永通
    土地改革后，我家分到十九亩地，按说打下的粮食是该够吃的，可是因为家底子薄，买不起肥料，所以打的粮食还是不富裕。
    当时不够吃就得借高利贷。但越借高利贷就越不够吃。去年夏天打了四石麦子，光还高利贷连本带利就去了一半。等种秋麦子的时候我家连麦种也没有啦。后来多亏政府贷给了一百斤麦种，才把小麦种上；信用合作社又低利贷给我一部分款，买了口粮，顾住了生活。要不然就又得挨高利贷的刀子了。
    今年春耕下种时，我的地里正缺少肥料，政府又委托供销合作社对农民实行粮食、棉花预购，我就跟供销合作社订了预售一百斤粮食和一百斤棉花的合同，把八万元定金买了肥料下到地里，加上今年这里雨水好，到秋收时，我那二亩七分施用肥料的地就打了四石五斗粮食。
    我知道政府实行统购统销政策一来是为着支援国家工业化，再者也为着保护农民的利益，免得咱们再受奸商和高利贷剥削的苦。所以我完全拥护政府统购统销政策。今年夏收时，我曾和我老婆估计了一下年成：今年收的粮食除交公粮、留种籽外，还可以卖给国家五百斤粮食，剩下的到过年都有白面吃了。现在，我准备再多卖给国家二百斤秋粮。
