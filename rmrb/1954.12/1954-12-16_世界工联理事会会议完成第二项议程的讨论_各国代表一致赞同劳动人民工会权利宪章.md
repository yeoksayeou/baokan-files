Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 15th Dispatch: The World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting completed the discussion of the second agenda item (Charter of Trade Union Rights for Working People and Launching a Worldwide Movement to Defend and Expand Trade Union Rights and Democratic Rights) on the morning of the 14th.

From the 12th to the morning of the 14th, the meeting discussed the report made by World Federation of Trade Unions President Vittorio on this agenda item. All speakers unanimously endorsed the Charter of Trade Union Rights for Working People and expressed their conviction that this charter would help the working class in capitalist, colonial, and semi-colonial countries in their struggle to protect and fight for trade union rights and democratic freedoms.

N.V. Popova, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union, said that the Charter of Trade Union Rights would undoubtedly prove to be a new weapon for the working people in their daily struggle to win their vital interests. She said that the workers and staff of the Soviet Union expressed their greatest support and satisfaction with the Charter of Trade Union Rights. The trade union rights listed in this charter have already been achieved by the Soviet working class and have been legally enshrined in the Soviet Constitution. Popova pointed out that at a time when monopoly capitalists and governments of capitalist countries are frantically attempting to deprive the working class of all social achievements and democratic rights, it is our sacred duty to the workers of the world to use all our influence and the full prestige of our powerful organizations to repel the attacks of aggressive forces, protect and expand the democratic rights and freedoms of the working people, and defend peace and the independence of all nations.

Zhu Xuefan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that the aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism is frantically preparing for new wars, deepening international tensions, and enslaving the people of Asian countries to ensure the maximum profits of monopoly capitalists. It has wantonly trampled on the trade union rights and democratic rights of workers and people in many colonial and semi-colonial countries, and the very existence of these rights is often threatened. He said that the Chinese working class, which has suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialists for many years, fully understands that the working class in colonial and semi-colonial countries must unite with the broadest strata of the people in the fierce struggle for national independence and democratic rights. The struggle for trade union rights and democratic rights must be a fundamental component of the national liberation struggle. Zhu Xuefan concluded by saying that the Charter of Trade Union Rights drafted by the World Federation of Trade Unions reflects the vital interests of the working people of all Asia. We firmly believe that the working people of Asian countries and all trade union organizations will warmly support this charter.

A trade union representative from West Germany said that the adoption of the Charter of Trade Union Rights would be of great significance to the trade union movement in West Germany. In West Germany, trade union rights and democratic freedoms are increasingly under attack by the Adenauer government, which is attempting to revive the forces of monopoly capitalism and militarism.

Latin American trade union representative José Moreira said that the Charter of Trade Union Rights also reflects the basic demands of the working people of Latin America. The attacks by imperialism and the governments that depend on them against the achievements and rights of the working people of Latin American countries are linked to special attacks on our trade union rights.

Argentine trade union representative Rivas said that we will strengthen organizational work in our movement so that the Charter of Trade Union Rights will be accepted by all organized workers and all progressive, democratically-minded people in the country.

Louis, General Secretary of the Algerian Trade Union Liaison Committee, said that the Algerian delegation supports the Charter of Trade Union Rights and believes that it will help the Algerian working people to fight for the improvement of their living and working conditions and for the realization of trade union and democratic rights.

Many other delegates also spoke at the meeting.

Vittorio emphasized at the end of the discussion that all the speeches at the meeting showed that the adoption of the Charter of Trade Union Rights for Working People was necessary and urgent.

    世界工联理事会会议完成第二项议程的讨论
    各国代表一致赞同劳动人民工会权利宪章
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社华沙讯：世界工会联合会理事会会议在十四日上午完成了第二项议程（劳动人民的工会权利宪章和展开一个保卫和扩大工会权利和民主权利的世界范围的运动）的讨论。
    从十二日到十四日上午，会议对世界工联主席维多里奥就这一项议程所作的报告进行了讨论。所有发言的人都一致赞同劳动人民的工会权利宪章，并且表示确信这个宪章能够帮助资本主义、殖民地和半殖民地国家的工人阶级进行保护和争取工会权利和民主自由的斗争。
    全苏工会中央理事会书记尼·瓦·波波娃发言说，工会权利宪章无疑将证明是劳动人民每天进行争取他们切身利益的斗争的新武器。她说，苏联的工人和职员对工会权利宪章表示最大的支持，并且感觉十分满意。这个宪章中所列入的工会权利，是苏联工人阶级已经取得并且已经在苏联宪法中用法律形式固定了下来的。波波娃指出，在这垄断资本家和资本主义国家政府疯狂地企图剥夺工人阶级的一切社会成果和民主权利的时候，利用我们的全部影响和我们强大组织的全部威信来打退侵略势力的进攻，保护和扩大劳动人民的民主权利和自由，保卫和平和各国人民的独立，就是我们对全世界工人负有的神圣责任。
    中华全国总工会副主席朱学范发言说，以美国帝国主义为首的侵略集团正在疯狂地准备新的战争，加深国际紧张局势，奴役亚洲国家的人民，来保证垄断资本家的最大利润。它对许多殖民地和半殖民地国家的工人和人民的工会权利和民主权利横加蹂躏，这些权利本身的存在经常受到威胁。他说，许多年来身受帝国主义者的压迫和剥削的中国工人阶级完全懂得，殖民地和半殖民地国家的工人阶级必须在争取民族独立和民主权利的剧烈斗争中同人民中的最广泛的阶层联合起来。争取工会权利和民主权利的斗争必须是民族解放斗争的基本组成部分。朱学范最后说，世界工联草拟的工会权利宪章，反映了全亚洲劳动人民的切身利益。我们坚信亚洲国家的劳动人民和一切工会组织都将热烈支持这个宪章。
    西德的工会代表说，工会权利宪章的通过将对西德的工会运动有极大的重要意义。在西德，工会权利和民主自由正越来越受到企图复活垄断资本和军国主义势力的阿登纳政府的进攻。
    拉丁美洲工会代表何塞·摩雷拉说，工会权利宪章也反映了拉丁美洲劳动人民的基本要求。帝国主义和依附他们的各国政府对拉丁美洲各国劳动人民的成就和权利的进攻，是同对我们工会权利的特殊的进攻相联系的。
    阿根廷工会代表里瓦斯发言说，我们将在我们的运动中加强组织工作，以便使工会权利宪章为全国一切有组织的工人和所有进步的、有民主思想的人们所接受。
    阿尔及利亚工会联络委员会总书记路易兹发言说，阿尔及利亚代表团支持工会权利宪章并且认为它将帮助阿尔及利亚劳动人民为改善他们的生活和工作条件，为实现工会和民主权利而斗争。
    在会上发言的还有其他许多代表。
    维多里奥在讨论结束的时候着重指出，会议上所有的发言都表明，通过劳动人民工会权利宪章是必要的和迫切的。
