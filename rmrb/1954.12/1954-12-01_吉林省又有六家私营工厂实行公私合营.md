Six more private factories in Jilin Province have implemented joint state-private ownership.

This year, the number of joint state-private enterprises in Jilin Province has continued to increase. From January to October, six private factories in the province implemented joint state-private ownership. According to statistics at the end of October, the province already has eleven joint state-private enterprises, including Changchun Medical Book Printing Factory, Changchun Grain Processing Joint Stock Company, Jilin Zhongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Gongzhuling Xinsheng Repair Factory. The proportion of the total output value of joint state-private enterprises in the province's total industrial output value has increased from 1.1 percent in 1950 to 2.8 percent.

After these enterprises implemented joint state-private ownership, new atmospheres generally emerged in production and management. For example, the predecessor of Changchun Grain Processing Joint Stock Company, Changchun Yifahe Joint Stock Company, had many shortcomings in management and operations in the past, and had long failed to complete the processing tasks entrusted by the state, and the entire enterprise was paralyzed. After joint state-private ownership, all employees launched a movement of "improving production and practicing strict economy," and put forward 42 rationalization proposals in four months, of which 35 could be adopted; at the same time, they also improved 48 kinds of machine parts. As a result, the company's total output value increased by 101 percent compared with the same period last year; productivity has also increased, and the output per machine per hour has increased from 32.5 bags in the past to 67.3 bags. In addition, the entire company also saved more than 100 million yuan worth of wealth. After the joint state-private ownership of Jilin Jiami Can Making and Printing Factory, production has continued to develop, and the number of workers has increased more than four times compared with before the joint state-private ownership. The dividends distributed to the private sector have also increased. With the reform of enterprises and the development of production, the thinking of capitalists and their agents has also been transformed to a certain extent.

    吉林省又有六家私营工厂实行公私合营
    吉林省公私合营企业今年续有增加。从一月到十月，全省有六家私营工厂实行了公私合营。据十月底的统计，全省已经有长春医学图书印刷厂、长春粮谷加工股份有限公司、吉林忠信染织厂、公主岭新生修配厂等十一个公私合营企业。公私合营企业的生产总值占全省工业总产值的比重，已经由一九五零年的百分之一点一增加到百分之二点八。
    这些企业实行公私合营以后，一般都在生产、经营管理等方面出现了新气象。如长春粮谷加工股份有限公司的前身长春益发合股份有限公司，过去由于经营管理等方面存在很多缺点，长期完不成国家委托的加工任务，整个企业陷于瘫痪状态。公私合营以后，全体职工开展了“搞好生产，厉行节约”的运动，四个月提出了四十二项合理化建议，其中有三十五项可以采纳；同时，他们还改进了四十八种机器部件。结果这个公司的生产总值比去年同时期提高了百分之一百零一；生产率也有了提高，每台机器每小时的产量已经由过去的三十二点五袋提高到六十七点三袋。另外，全公司还节省了价值一亿多元的财富。吉林省嘉美制罐印刷厂公私合营以后生产不断发展，工人数目比公私合营前增加了四倍多。私方分得的红利也有了增加。随着企业的改革和生产的发展，资本家及其代理人的思想也得到了一定程度的改造。（本报集体通讯员吉林日报编辑部）
