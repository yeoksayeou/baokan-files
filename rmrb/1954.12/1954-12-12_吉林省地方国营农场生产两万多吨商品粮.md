Jilin Provincial State-Operated Farms Produce Over 20,000 Tons of Commercial Grain

    The thirty-one local state-operated grain farms in Jilin Province have signed sales contracts with the state grain departments, selling 20,197 tons of grain to the state, accounting for 82.5 percent of the total harvest of the farms.

    Although the local state-operated grain farms suffered relatively serious natural disasters this year, they overcame the natural disasters and achieved higher yields than the local areas with the active efforts of all employees. The average yield of paddy rice per hectare in the six larger local state-operated grain farms such as Lishu and Guoqian Banner reached 6,270 jin, which was 1,926 jin more than the average yield per hectare of local farmers. The average yield of paddy rice per hectare in Shuangliao Rongjun Grain Farm was 6,808 jin, exceeding the yield per hectare of the neighboring Guo Hailin Agricultural Production Cooperative by 34 percent. The commodity rate of each local state-operated farm is also higher than that of local farmers and agricultural production cooperatives. The commodity rate of Lishu Local State-Operated Grain Farm reached 84 percent of the total output, which is more than 60 percent higher than that of Zhang Zhen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaobai Village, Lishu 13th District.

    At present, the employees of the local state-operated farms are working hard to thresh grain, and put forward the slogan of "Hand in more first-class grain, eliminate substandard grain," to improve grain quality and deliver the grain to the state granary in a timely manner.

    吉林省地方国营农场生产两万多吨商品粮
    吉林省三十一个地方国营谷物农场，已分别和国家粮食部门签订了售粮合同，卖给国家两万零一百九十七吨粮食，占农场总收获量的百分之八十二点五。
    各地方国营谷物农场今年虽遭受了比较严重的自然灾害，但在全体职工的积极努力下，战胜了自然灾害，获得了较当地为高的产量。梨树、郭前旗等六个较大的地方国营谷物农场每垧水稻的平均产量达六千二百七十斤，比当地农民每垧地的平均产量多一千九百二十六斤。双辽荣军谷物农场每垧水稻平均产量是六千八百零八斤，超过邻近郭海林农业生产合作社每垧产量百分之三十四。各地方国营农场的商品率也高于当地农民和农业生产合作社。梨树地方国营谷物农场的商品率达总产量的百分之八十四，比梨树十三区小白村张珍农业生产合作社高百分之六十还多。
    现在各地方国营农场职工们正紧张地进行脱谷，并提出“多缴一等粮，消灭等外粮”的口号，提高粮食质量，及时把粮食送到国家粮库。
