Letter Excerpts

    Do Not Distribute New Year Pictures Unsuitable for Forest Areas to Forest Areas
    Gong Shichang of the Forest Fire Prevention Headquarters of Muling County, Heilongjiang Province writes: Our province is one of the major forest areas in the country. The government, in order to strictly prevent forest fires, has continuously issued forest fire prevention orders, repeatedly emphasizing that all sources of fire and open-air fire-making behaviors should be eliminated. However, some New Year pictures and other propaganda posters, regardless of the occasion, like to depict an elderly farmer with a pipe in his mouth, emitting wisps of smoke. The distribution units also do not consider the regional situation and send them to the forest areas. This is inconsistent with the requirement that people in forest areas should always pay attention to fire prevention and forest protection. I request that the New Year picture distribution agencies not distribute such pictures to forest areas.

专栏：来信摘要

    不要把不适宜于林区的年画发行到林区去
    黑龙江省穆稜县护林防火指挥部宫世昌来信：我省是全国主要林区之一。政府为了严防森林火灾，曾不断发出护林防火命令，一再强调应杜绝一切火源和野外弄火行为。但是有些年画及其他宣传画刊上却不分什么场合都是喜欢画一个老年农民衔着烟袋，冒着缕缕青烟。而发行单位也不考虑地区情况，就送到林区去，这和要求林区人民时刻注意防火护林的生活是不相符的。我要求发行年画机关不要把这类的画发行到林区去。
