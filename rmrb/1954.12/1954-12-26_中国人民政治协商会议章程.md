Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(Adopted by the First Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on December 25, 1954)

General Program

In the great revolutionary struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the Chinese people formed a people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party of China. In September 1949, on the basis of the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the organization of the Chinese people's democratic united front –– the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, held its first plenary session, exercised the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, formulated the Common Program, organized the Central People's Government, and declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China on behalf of the will of the people.

The First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference elected the National Committee, and the provincial and municipal consultative committees exercised the functions and powers of local committees in various localities. Over the past five years, the National Committee and the provincial and municipal consultative committees have played an important role in various social reform movements, in the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect the country and defend peace, in assisting the government to mobilize the people to participate in political, economic, and cultural construction, in consolidating and expanding the organization of the united front, and in carrying out ideological remolding.

Now, the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China has been convened. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been promulgated. The basic content of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has been incorporated into the Constitution, and this Common Program has been replaced by the Constitution. The task of the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to exercise the functions and powers of the National People's Congress has come to an end. However, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as an organization of the people's democratic united front that unites all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic individuals, still needs to exist. As the preamble to the Constitution states, "In the future, in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general task of the state during the transition period and in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, the people's democratic united front of our country will continue to play its role."

The Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, holding its first plenary session in December 1954, unanimously believes that the people's democratic system led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance has opened up broad avenues for the socialist development of our country. In order to strengthen the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, consolidate the people's democratic system, victoriously realize the general task of the state during the transition period, and enable our country to gradually eliminate the system of exploitation and build a socialist society through peaceful means, it is even more necessary to unite and concentrate the strength of the people of the whole country. Therefore, the Chinese people's democratic united front must be further consolidated and developed, and the core leadership role of the Communist Party of China must be further strengthened. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will continue to unite all ethnic groups in the country more broadly through the unity of the democratic parties and people's organizations, work together, overcome difficulties, and strive to build a great socialist country.

The First Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference formulates this Constitution and decides that the following items shall be the common guidelines for all units and individuals participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:

I. Support the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and fully implement its provisions.

II. Consolidate the people's democratic system led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance; strengthen the leading position of the socialist economy in the national economy.

III. Assist state organs and promote social forces to realize the state's construction plans for socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

IV. Maintain close ties with the masses, reflect their opinions to relevant state organs, and offer suggestions.

V. Strengthen unity among all ethnic groups in the country, promote patriotism, enhance revolutionary vigilance, defend national construction, and persist in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad.

VI. Continue to consolidate and develop the unbreakable friendship between China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and with all people's democratic countries, enhance China's friendship with all peace-loving countries, strengthen the friendship between the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world, oppose wars of aggression, safeguard world peace, and uphold the just cause of mankind.
