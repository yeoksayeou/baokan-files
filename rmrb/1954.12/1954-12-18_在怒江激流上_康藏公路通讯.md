    On the Rapids of the Nujiang River
    — A Communication from the Kangzang Highway
    Su Ce
    The road-building troops were blocked on the eastern bank of the roaring Nujiang River.

    When the engineers of the surveying team passed through here, because they could not carry more road-opening tools, although they tried their best, they could not uncover the secrets of the west bank of the Nujiang River, and could only draw seven kilometers of "unknown" dotted lines on the engineering line design blueprint with difficulty. Now, the task of uncovering the mystery of the west bank falls on the shoulders of soldier Li Wenyan and his four companions.

    Zhang Baode, the battalion commander of the advance battalion, is a battle-tested hero. He had also participated in opening up the highway from Erlang Mountain to the Nujiang River on the Kangzang Plateau, and crossed rapids such as the Dadu River and the Jinsha River. However, facing the Nujiang River in July, with a flow rate of eight to ten meters per second, he could not help but show anxiety. Because his battalion could not cross the Nujiang River, it blocked all the road-building forces. When he handed the task of crossing the river to Li Wenyan, he repeatedly urged: "We must force our way across and put up an iron cable. Although there are too many difficulties, although the Tibetans say that the Nujiang River at this time cannot be crossed at all, we must cross it. Now the eyes of the whole division are on us."

    On the morning of July 10th, before the white mist on the river had completely dissipated, Li Wenyan and his comrades had already inflated the only old rubber boat. There was no stopper on the boat's air valve. They blocked it with a wooden stick wrapped in cloth. Then they found that it was leaking air a bit, but they didn't care about it. They put the boat on the water, tied an oar to the stern as a rudder, tied the two wires to be dragged across the river to a leather buckle behind the boat, one person steered, four people sat in two rows, shouting: "One, two! One, two!" Rowing the oars, they rushed into the raging waves.

    Everyone in the battalion was watching them nervously on the shore. The boat floated in the huge waves like a leaf. It was pushed high by the waves for a while, and then fell into the water depression for a while. The wires were like a long tail, swinging behind the boat. They rowed hard, but they could not reach the center of the river. It turned out that after the wire dropped to the bottom of the river, it got caught on a rock, and the boat could not move. They had to slowly row back to the shore downstream.

    Then, the second forced crossing also suffered the same failure.

    The next day, someone came up with an idea: use an empty boat to carry four strands of wire across the river. There is a small eddy downstream on the opposite bank. The boat will stop there. Then call the Tibetans on the opposite bank to pull the wire ashore. As long as the wire can be dragged across, then the iron wire can be pulled over, and then the steel rope can be pulled over, so that a steel cable can be created, and the troops can slide across.

    This idea was very good, but unexpectedly, before the boat reached the center of the river, the wire was caught on a rock at the bottom of the river again. A huge wave pressed down, and the boat capsized. The wire broke, and the boat was washed away by the rapids. When it reached the small eddy on the opposite bank, it swayed a few times, crossed the eddy, and disappeared around the foot of the mountain in the blink of an eye along with the rapids.

    Everyone was stunned. What should we do? Li Wenyan was even more flustered, "How can we cross the river? This boat is the life of our entire battalion!" He looked at the opposite bank, looking at the swirling water patterns, and thought that there must be eddies below, and even if they couldn't stop the boat, they would slow it down. He hurriedly reported to the battalion commander: "Let me chase the boat! I will try my best to get it back!"

    The battalion commander looked at him, patted him on the shoulder and said: "We only have this one way now. Good comrade, I will send someone to support you immediately."

    The canyon was very hot. Li Wenyan hurriedly took off his coat and ran along the river. After running for a while, a small mountain blocked the road. He couldn't bother to find a road, so he rushed to the mountain. With great difficulty, he climbed to the top of the mountain. Looking, the river flowed windingly in the valley to the distance. Where is the boat? There was no trace of it. So, he rushed to the second mountain next to the river regardless of everything. This mountain was full of thorns and very steep, but he kept climbing up the mountain, grabbing the thorns with both hands. His hands and legs were scratched, his shirt was soaked with sweat, and his respiratory organs were making sounds like bellows. When he climbed to the top of the mountain, he saw that the boat seemed to have sunk to the bottom of the river. There was still no trace. He was disappointed, felt his legs go soft, and really wanted to sit down and have a good rest, but a thought flashed into his mind: "Is this probably what the battalion commander said, called bowing to difficulties? No, I have to go quickly, I must chase it back!" Then he mustered up his courage and ran along the river.

    I don't know how far he ran, he came to a small village. Huge earthen rocks blocked the road, and he couldn't find a way down to the river for a while, so he found a Tibetan villager, gestured for a while, and asked him to lead the way to the river. Before he even reached the river, Li Wenyan saw the rubber boat from afar swirling in a large eddy at the foot of the mountain in front, like a black big fish jumping there. He jumped up happily as if he had seen a long-lost relative, and hurriedly ran to the river. He saw the boat from a distance as if it was very close to the shore, but when he got closer, he saw that it was still two or three zhang away from the shore. What to do? He thought for a while, took off his shoes and went into the water. But the Tibetan grabbed him and said a lot to him, he couldn't understand a word. From his gestures, he was telling him: the water here is too dangerous, you can't go down. The Tibetan villager ran home and brought a rope for carrying firewood, with a stone tied to it, wanting to throw it on the boat and pull the boat over. But this method failed. The rope was thrown into the water, and the water made a horizontal mark, falling more than a zhang away from the boat.

    Li Wenyan took off his shirt and threw it on the shore. He was afraid that going straight over would wash the boat away, so he went into the water facing the direction the boat was turning. Who knew that as soon as his feet touched the water, he couldn't touch the bottom, and a wave knocked him into the water. He struggled desperately to turn upwards, and just when he poked his head out of the water, he was hit by a wave again. He thought: as long as I can grab the boat, that's good. So he struggled and swam, estimating that he had reached the place where he would meet the boat, and when he looked up, the boat had already slipped past him two or three meters and was floating downstream. He was anxious, and swam into the rapids regardless of everything. The huge waves pushed him, chased for ten meters, and finally grabbed the boat. At that time, he was as happy as if he had won some treasure in the river, happily grabbing the boat with one hand and swimming towards the shore. He hadn't swam far when a rope was thrown to his eyes from the shore. It turned out that Cui Ximing, who was sent to support him, had arrived. Cui Ximing threw the end of the old villager's firewood-carrying rope to him, and he hurriedly grabbed the rope. At this time, he felt that all the strength in his body was really completely exhausted. The sun had set, and the river water was bone-chillingly cold.

    Before dawn the next day, Li Wenyan and his companions began preparing to cross the river again. They chose a new ferry three or four miles upstream from the old ferry, changed the failed method of releasing the wire from the ferry twice before, and decided to release the wire from both the shore and the boat, and assigned the task of releasing the wire on the boat to the experienced Cui Ximing who had just been sent. After everything was ready, they untied the cable and set sail.

    The boat swayed gently on the shore as if hesitating a few times, and then rushed into the rapids in a flash under the neat movements of the four oars. When it reached the center of the river, the boat moved horizontally along the rapids, floating on the water like flying. All the people on the shore forgot themselves, and their hearts rose and fell with the small black boat. The people on the boat were all soaked with water, their eyes facing one direction, shouting in unison: "One, two! One, two!" Rowing the oars desperately, it took a long time to slowly row out of the middle of the river.

    At this time, the wires on the slope were released, and the wires in Cui Ximing's hand were also messed up. The wire pulled the boat, and the huge waves became even more crazy, hitting the boat one after another. The boat couldn't bear the pull of these two forces, and swayed violently. Cui Ximing was anxious, and the wires in his hand were messed up. He didn't know how they got caught on Huang Xinpan's oar. With a pull, the oar fell into the water and was washed away. At this moment, the wire at the stern of the boat was also broken by the waves, and the boat spun in the rapids like a kite with a broken string. Someone panicked....

    Cui Ximing shouted loudly: "Don't panic! Sit tight, it doesn't matter if we lose an oar, rush to the opposite bank!"

    Li Wenyan raised a hand and shouted: "Everyone listen to me shout one, two, and work together to row across the river! Those without oars use their hands to row. Come on! One, two!"

    "One, two!" Everyone shouted.

    "One, two! One, two!"……

    The boat finally slowly broke through the rapids and approached the shore. When the six of them climbed onto the west bank dripping wet, they saw everyone on the east bank waving their hands and cheering at them. They also raised their oars and cheered.

    At more than five o'clock in the afternoon, I don't know who came up with the idea of using two thick wooden sticks more than one meter long, tied with a No. 12 thin iron wire, to be washed over with the water. But when it rushed to the center of the river, it couldn't cross the rapids to reach the shore. When Li Wenyan saw it, he hurriedly divided everyone into two shifts. Cui Ximing led two comrades to pull the half of the wire behind the rubber boat, and Li Wenyan himself took two comrades on the boat to salvage the wooden sticks. The wire was released slowly, and the boat slowly moved towards the center of the river, finally meeting the wooden stick. But the boat was originally a flat boat without a side, and if one was not careful while salvaging things on the river, one would slip into the water. So, others held Li Wenyan's waist and let him salvage the wooden stick.

    Everyone was extremely happy when they saw the thin iron wire tied to the wooden stick. How much effort and sweat did everyone spend to pull it across the river! But there was also a cloth bag tied to the wooden stick. What was inside? When they opened it, everyone was stunned. It turned out to be eighteen small steamed buns.

    Although everyone's stomachs had been rumbling for a long time, no one reached out to take a bun to eat. Because everyone thought that the kitchen had no flour, this must have been specially sent by the leader.

    When they thought of the regimental leader and the battalion leader, everyone was a little reluctant to eat them. Although the buns had been battered by the river water, everyone still only ate two and kept one for preservation.

    Night came, and the river wind was even more bone-chilling. When they got on the boat, they were only wearing underpants and vests, and they didn't even have shoes. All three quilts they brought had been soaked by the water. So, they found some grass and spread it on the beach and sat around the campfire all night. Early the next morning, they dragged the iron wire two or three miles upstream to the opposite bank where they took the boat. Everyone pulled the iron wire hard. After the No. 12 iron wire was pulled, the No. 8 thick iron wire followed. They tied the iron wire to a large stone, and then the clothes slipped over from the iron wire, then the food slipped over, and then the leader, fearing that their rubber boat would leak air, also slipped over a small bellows. The Nujiang River could no longer cut off the connection between the heroes on both sides like it had been cutting open the earth.

    On this day, three thick iron wires were pulled over one after another, but because the river water was rapid, there were only six people pulling on this side while there were more than thirty people on the other side. All twelve hands were swollen, and the palms were as fat as steamed buns, unable to open or clench.

    They all slept very soundly that night. The fatigue of the past few days seemed to pour into this day. No matter how the night wind blew, it didn't wake them up. They slept until dawn. But as soon as they opened their eyes, they found that the river water had changed, and they didn't recognize it a bit. It had risen by two meters overnight, and the small bellows they had put on the river bank had also been blown away. The river water was only one meter away from where they were sleeping. Fortunately, the rubber boat was tied tightly, and it was still floating proudly on the water.

    Not long after, a sack slipped over from the wire. It was difficult to tell what was inside from a distance. Everyone was puzzled: "Why did they give us a sack? Is it for spreading? Or for covering?"

    With the sound of the wire, the sack came over. Ah! It turned out to be a telephone. They jumped up happily. Cui Ximing hurriedly put the wire on the iron wire and plugged in the ground wire. All six heads were squeezed in front of the telephone. Li Wenyan shouted: "Shake the bell quickly, ask the company commander to speak!"

    When they shook the bell, it turned out that the other side was also shaking the bell. Everyone calmed down and listened to Cui Ximing asking: "Hello, hello, who is this?"

    A somewhat unfamiliar voice came from the earphone: "Comrades, you have worked hard!"

    "Who is it?" Cui Ximing asked Li Wenyan in a low voice. At this moment, the other party spoke again: "I am Gan Yanlin, I am here to congratulate you!"

    Cui Ximing jumped up holding the earphone and shouted: "It's the division commander! It's the division commander!" He waved his hand to the opposite bank and shouted: "Ah! Division commander! Division commander!"

    Sure enough, everyone saw a person wearing a blue shirt waving his hat and beckoning on the opposite bank. Everyone shouted: "Ah! Division commander! Division commander!"

    The telephone bell rang again, and everyone squeezed on the earphone and listened hard to the division commander's order: "Good comrades, you have opened up the road for my division to advance, you have opened up the road for all the road-building forces to advance! I thank you on behalf of everyone! Thank you, Comrade Li Wenyan, the organizer of the river crossing. I believe that the Tibetan people will also thank you."

    Listening, Li Wenyan's heart was as agitated as the river water, and his eyes were filled with tears.

    The division commander continued: "I order you: continue to work hard to pull the steel rope over, build an iron cable bridge, let the troops cross the river to construct, and let the highway advance to Lhasa!"

    在怒江激流上
    ——康藏公路通讯
    苏策
    筑路部队被阻遏在咆哮的怒江东岸。
    勘测队的工程师们从这里走过的时候，由于不能携带更多的开路工具，虽然费尽了千辛万苦，也无法揭开怒江西岸的秘密，只能为难地在工程线路设计蓝图上划下了七公里“未知”的虚线。现在，揭开西岸之谜的工作落在战士李文炎和他的四个伙伴的肩头。
    先遣营的营长张保德是位身经百战的英雄，在康藏高原上又曾参加过开辟二郎山到怒江边的公路，跨越过大渡河和金沙江等激流，但面对着这流速八公尺至十公尺的七月的怒江，也不能不显露焦躁。因为自己的营不能跨过怒江，就挡住了所有的筑路大军。当他把渡江任务交给李文炎的时候，曾再三叮嘱：“我们一定要强渡过去，拉起一条铁索来。虽然困难太多了，虽然藏民说这时间的怒江是绝对不能渡过的，但我们一定要渡过去。现在全师的眼睛都在看着我们。”
    七月十日的清晨，江上的白雾还没有完全消散，李文炎他们已把那只唯一的旧橡皮船打饱了气。船的气门上没有塞子，他们用木棒缠上布把它堵上，接着又发现它有点走气，但他们顾不得了，把船放在水上，把一只桨绑在船尾当舵，把准备拖过江去的两根电线绑在船后的一个皮扣上，一个人把舵，四个人分两排坐好，喊着：“一二、一二！”摇着桨，朝惊涛骇浪里冲去。
    全营的人都在岸上紧张地注视着他们。船就像一片树叶似的在巨浪中飘着。一会被浪推得高起来，一会又跌落到水凹里，电线就像是一条长尾巴一样，在船后摆来摆去。他们用力地划着，但总冲不到江心。原来电线垂到江底以后，挂在石头上，船走不动了，他们只得在下游慢慢地靠回岸来。
    接着，第二次的强渡也遭到了同样的失败。
    第二天，有人想出一个办法：用空船带四股电线飘过江去，江对岸的下方有一个小回水湾，船到那里会停住的，然后再呼喊对岸的藏民把电线拉上岸，只要电线能拖过去，就可以接着把铅丝拉过去，再把钢绳拉过去，就可以造成一条钢溜索，把部队滑过去。
    这个主意很好，但不料船还没有走到江心，电线又挂在河底的一个石头上了，一个巨浪压下来，船翻了一个身，电线断了，船被激流冲走，到了对岸的小回水湾的时候，它摇摆了几下，就跨过那回水湾，随着激流，一刹眼的功夫，转过山脚不见了。
    所有的人都楞住了，这可怎么办呢？李文炎更是心慌意乱起来，“这可怎么过江呀？这只船是我们全营的命呀！”他望了望对岸，看着那打着旋旋的水纹，想起下面一定也会有回水湾，截不住船也会叫船走慢的。他急忙向营长报告：“让我去追船吧！我一定努力把它追回来！”
    营长看了看他，拍了一下他的肩膀说：“我们现在只有这一个办法了。好同志，我马上派人去支援你。”
    峡谷里很热，李文炎急忙脱掉外衣，沿着江飞跑起来。跑了一阵，迎面一个小山挡住了路，他顾不上找路，就冲向山上去，好容易爬到山顶，一看，江水在山谷里弯弯曲曲流向远方，船呢？没有一点踪影。于是，他不顾一切地冲向江边的第二座山头。这座山满布荆棘，并且非常陡，但他一刻不停地双手抓着荆棘向山上爬，手腿都被划出血了，衬衣全叫汗湿透了，呼吸器官像拉风箱一样地响着，等爬上山头一看，船像是沉到江底去了，仍然没有一点踪迹。他失望了，觉得双腿发软，真想坐下来好好歇歇，但一个思想猛然掠过脑际：“这大概就是营长说的，叫做向困难低头了吧？不行，要快走，一定要把它追回来！”然后就鼓起一把气，沿着江跑起来。
    不知道跑了多远，前面碰到了一个小村庄。巨大的土岩挡住了路，一时找不到下到江边的去路，于是找了一个藏族老乡，作了一阵手势，请他领到了江边。在还没有走到江边的时候，李文炎老远就看到橡皮船在前面山脚下的一个大回水湾里盘旋着，像一条黑色的大鱼在那里跃动着。他像是见了久别的亲人一样，高兴的跳了起来，急忙跑到江边去。远处看见船像是离岸很近，但到跟前一看还离岸有两三丈远。怎么办呢，他想了想，就脱了鞋子走下水去。但那个藏民一把把他抓住了，唠唠叨叨的给他说了许多话，他一句也听不懂。从他手势看来，是告诉他：这里水太险，不能下去。藏民老乡跑回家里拿来了一根扛柴用的绳子，上面绑了一块石头，想丢到船上，把船拉过来。但这个办法失败了，绳子甩到水里，给水打了一条横印，在离船一丈多远的地方落下去。
    李文炎把衬衣脱了下来摔在岸上，他怕正面过去把船冲跑，就迎着船回旋来的方向下了水。谁知脚一下水就触不到底，一个浪把他打到水里去。他拼命向上翻，刚把头探出水面，又被浪打下去。他想：只要能抓住船就好了。就努力挣扎着、游着，估计到了和船碰头的地方，抬头一看，船已经溜过自己二三公尺，浮向下游去了。他着急了，不顾一切向激流游去，巨浪推着他，追了十来公尺，终于把船抓住了。那时他像是夺得了江里什么宝物似的，快乐地一手抓着船，一面向岸边游着。游了没多远，有一条绳子从岸上甩到他的眼前，原来是派来支援他的崔锡明赶到了。崔锡明把老乡扛柴的绳子的一头甩给了他，他急忙抓住了绳子，这时候，他才感到全身力量真是完全用尽了。太阳落了山，江水冷得刺骨。
    第二天天还没有明，李文炎和他的伙伴们又开始了渡江的准备。他们在距旧渡口上方三四里路的地方，选择了新渡口，改变了前两次渡口放电线的失败办法，决定岸上和船上两头放线，并且把船上放线这一工作，交给了新派来的老练的崔锡明来担任。等一切停当后，就解缆开船了。
    船像是犹豫似的在岸边轻轻摇摆了几下，就在四个桨整齐地动作下，一刹那冲进激流去。到了江中心，船顺着激流横走起来，像是飞一样的漂在水上。所有岸上的人都忘掉了自己，心随着这黑色的小船一起一落。船上的人全身都叫水打湿了，眼睛朝着一个方向，齐声喊着：一二、一二！”拼命划着桨，好半天才慢慢划出了中流。
    这时，坡岸上的电线放完了，崔锡明手上的电线也放乱了。电线扯住了船，巨浪更加疯狂，一个连一个打上船来。船耐不住这两个力量的牵扯，一歪一歪颠波得厉害。崔锡明急了，手上的电线一乱，不知怎么挂住了黄新潘的桨，一扯，桨落到水里被冲走了。正在这时，船尾的电线也被浪打断了，船像断了线的风筝在激流中打起转转来，有人慌了……。
    崔锡明大声喊着：“别慌！快坐稳，少一只桨不要紧，朝对岸冲！”
    李文炎举起了一只手，也嚷着：“大家听我喊一二，一齐用力划过江去！没有桨的用手划。来呀！一、二！”
    “一、二！”大家喊着。
    “一、二”“一、二！”……
    船终于慢慢穿出激流，靠近岸边了。当他们六个人浑身湿淋淋的爬上西岸时，看见东岸所有的人都举着手向他们欢呼，他们也举着桨，欢呼起来。
    下午五点多钟，不知道是谁想出的办法，用两根一公尺多长的粗木棍，绑着一根十二号细铅丝顺水冲过来。但是冲到江心却不能越过激流靠岸。李文炎看见了，急忙把大家分了两班，由崔锡明领着两个同志扯着橡皮船后的半截电线，由李文炎自己带两个同志上船去打捞木棍。电线慢慢放着，船慢慢向江中走着，终于和那个木棍碰了头。但船原是个没有船帮的平板，捞江上的东西，人一不小心就会滑到水里去。于是由别人抱着李文炎的腰，让他把木棒捞上来。
    一看到木棒上绑着细铅丝，大家高兴极了。为了把它扯过江来，大家曾费了多少心血，流了多少汗呀！但木棒上还绑着一个布包，这里面是什么呢？打开一看，大家都愣住了，原来是十八个小馍馍。
    虽然每个人的肚子早已骨碌碌的叫了，但却没有人伸手拿馍吃。因为大家想到大伙房是没有面粉的，这一定是首长特意送来的。
    一想起团首长和营首长，大家有点舍不得吃了，虽然馍已经叫江水打得稀巴烂，每个人也还只吃了两个，留一个保存好。
    夜来了，江风更加刺骨，他们上船的时候只穿了裤衩背心，连鞋也没有，带过来的三床被子都叫水打湿了。于是，他们弄了些草铺在河滩上，围着篝火坐了一夜。第二天一清早，他们拖着铅丝向上游走了二三里，到了他们坐船起渡的对岸。大家用力拉着铅丝，十二号铅丝拉完了，后面跟过来了八号粗铅丝。他们把铅丝绑在一块大石头上，于是衣服从铅丝上滑过来了，接着饭又滑过来了，接着首长怕他们橡皮船走了气，又滑过来一个小风箱。怒江再不能像斩开大地一样来斩断两岸英雄的联系。
    这一天连续拉过来三根粗铅丝，但是因为江水急，对岸三十多人放，这边只有六个人拉，十二只手都拉肿了，手掌心像馍馍一样胖了起来，既不能张，也不能拳。
    这一晚他们都睡得很香，几天的疲劳像是涌到这一天来了，不管夜风怎样吹，都没有把他们冻醒，一觉睡到天明。但他们一睁眼，就发现江水变样了，变得有些不认识了。它连夜暴涨了两公尺，把他们放在江边的小风箱也刮走了，江水离他们睡觉的地方只有一公尺远了，好在橡皮船拴得牢，它还骄傲的漂在水面上。
      不久，从铅丝上又滑过一个麻包来。老远弄不清里面是什么东西，大家怪纳闷：“为什么给我们麻包呢？是叫铺呢？还是叫盖呢？”
    随着铅丝的响声，麻包过来了。呀！原来是个电话机。他们高兴的跳了起来。崔锡明急忙把线搭在铅丝上，把地线插好。六个头都挤到电话机的跟前来。李文炎叫着：“快摇铃，请连长讲话！”
    一摇铃，原来对面也在摇铃。大家静下来了，听崔锡明问着：“喂，喂，你是谁？”
    从耳机里传来一个有点生疏的声音：“同志们辛苦了！”
    “谁呀？”崔锡明轻声问着李文炎。正在这时，对方又说话了：“我是干炎林，我来给你们贺功！”
    崔锡明拿着耳机跳了起来大叫着：“是师长！是师长！”他向对岸挥着手喊着：“啊！师长！师长！”
    果然，大家都看见对岸一个穿着蓝衬衫的人挥着帽子在招手。大家都喊着：“啊！师长！师长！”
    电话铃又响了响，大家都挤到耳机上用力听着师长的命令：“好同志们，你们给我师打开了前进的道路，你们给我们全体筑路大军打开了前进的道路！我代表大家感谢你们！感谢你们渡江的组织者李文炎同志。我相信，藏族人民也会感谢你们的。”
    李文炎听着，心里像江水似的激动着，眼里噙满了眼泪。
    师长继续说：“我命令你们：继续努力拉过钢绳去，架起铁索桥来，让部队渡过江去施工，让公路向拉萨前进！”
