Mayor Peng Zhen's Speech

Respected Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen:

    Today, the people of our capital city hold this grand meeting to welcome our distinguished guest, Prime Minister U Nu of the Union of Burma, to visit our country. This is another significant event in the history of friendly relations between the governments and peoples of China and Burma, following our Premier's visit to Burma earlier this year. On behalf of all the citizens of Beijing, I extend a warm welcome to Prime Minister U Nu, and through you, express our heartfelt respect to the citizens of Rangoon and the people of Burma.

    The people of China and Burma have a long and profound friendship, with frequent cultural and economic exchanges. Our two peoples have repeatedly sent their representatives to visit each other with goodwill and friendship. These contacts and exchanges have greatly promoted mutual understanding and friendship between us. Both our peoples have suffered from the aggression and oppression of colonialism, and in our respective struggles for national independence and sovereignty, the understanding and friendship between our two peoples have been further enhanced. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, relations between the two countries have become even closer on a new foundation. Cultural and economic exchanges and other friendly interactions have become increasingly frequent. The people of our capital have received distinguished guests and friends from Burma many times, who have brought the precious friendship of the Burmese government and people. In June of this year, our Premier visited Burma and issued a joint statement with you, Mr. Prime Minister, establishing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This statement provides a good guarantee for the development of friendly relations between China and Burma and for maintaining peace and security in Asia. This statement has been widely welcomed by peace-loving people in Asia and the world.

    Mr. Prime Minister, the Chinese people are peace-loving. From the first day of your arrival in Beijing, you will see the warm welcome shown to you by the people of the capital, and you will also see the strong desire of the people of the capital to maintain peace. We know that the hardworking and intelligent Burmese people are equally peace-loving. While our people are working hard to make their lives better day by day, we also hope that the Burmese people will not be disturbed by external forces and will achieve an increasingly prosperous and happy life.

    Beijing is an ancient city, but also a young city. Here you will see many beautiful buildings created by the working people of past generations, and at the same time, you will see many newly built and under-construction factories, schools, farms, and other municipal and cultural constructions. There are still many shortcomings in our work, and we hope that you will point out our shortcomings after your visit.

    Respected Prime Minister, your visit will surely enhance the friendship and cooperation between China and Burma, and will therefore be conducive to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    Please allow me to once again, on behalf of the people of Beijing, extend a warm welcome to you, Mr. Prime Minister!

    Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!
    Long live peace in Asia!
    Long live world peace!

    彭真市长的讲话尊敬的总理先生：各位女士，各位先生：
    今天我们首都人民举行大会欢迎我们的贵宾、缅甸联邦吴努总理前来我国访问，这是继我国总理今年访问缅甸后，中缅两国政府和人民友好关系史上的又一重大事件。我现在代表北京市全体市民向吴努总理表示热烈的欢迎，并通过您，向仰光市民和缅甸人民表示衷心的敬意。
    中国人民和缅甸人民之间，有悠久而深厚的友谊，在文化上和经济上有频繁的交往。我们两国人民曾多次派遣自己的代表带着善意和友谊彼此访问。这些接触和往来，曾大大促进了我们相互间的了解和友谊。我们两国人民都曾遭受过殖民主义者的侵略和压迫，在我们各自争取民族独立和主权的斗争中，更增进了两国人民间的了解和友谊。中华人民共和国成立后，两国间的关系在新的基础上更加密切了起来。文化经济交流和其他友好来往日益频繁。我们首都人民曾多次接待了来自缅甸的贵宾和朋友，他们带来了缅甸政府和人民的珍贵的友谊。今年六月间，我国总理访问了缅甸，和您、总理先生发表了联合声明，确定了和平共处的五项原则。这个声明对于发展中缅两国的友好关系和维护亚洲和平和安全提供了良好的保证。这个声明获得了亚洲和世界爱好和平人民的普遍欢迎。
    总理先生，我们中国人民是热爱和平的，您从到达北京的第一天起，会看到首都人民所表现的对您的热烈欢迎，也会看到首都人民对维护和平的强烈愿望。我们知道勤劳聪明的缅甸人民同样是热爱和平的。当我国人民正在努力工作，把自己的生活安排得一天比一天美好的时候，同样我们也希望缅甸人民不受外来的干扰，获得日益繁荣幸福的生活。
    北京是一个古老的城市，也是一个年轻的城市。您在这里会看到许多历代劳动人民所创造的美丽建筑物，同时您也会看到许多新建的和正在建设中的工厂、学校、农庄和其他各项市政、文化建设。在我们的各项工作中还有不少缺点，希望您在参观后能对我们的缺点给予指正。
    尊敬的总理先生，您的访问必将增进中缅两国的友好和合作，因而也必将有利于亚洲和世界的和平事业。
    请允许我再一次代表北京市人民向您，总理先生，表示热烈的欢迎！
    中缅友好万岁！
    亚洲和平万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
