Thoroughly Implement the Party's Collective Leadership System
Dong Dong, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee

    The highest principle of the Party's leadership is the collectivity of leadership. Only based on the collective political experience and wisdom can we guarantee the correctness of the Party's leadership, the unity and solidarity of the Party ranks, the unity of the working class, the laboring people, and the entire people, and the victorious realization of great socialist construction.
    To improve the Party's collective leadership, on the one hand, we must oppose decentralism and individual decision-making on issues. Important issues must be collectively studied and discussed by the Party committee, and decisions must be made cautiously before being implemented throughout the Party. On the other hand, we must correctly implement the division of labor and responsibility under collective leadership, so that members of the Party committee and various departments can conscientiously and responsibly undertake their work. This is an indispensable and important aspect of implementing collective leadership. Without a correct, regular, and sound division of labor and responsibility system, it is impossible to achieve strong collective leadership. This is not only because collective decisions require the concentration of everyone's experience and wisdom, but also because the implementation of decisions relies on the conscientious efforts of collective members with their division of responsibilities. Of course, division of labor and responsibility does not mean that individuals or departments can act arbitrarily and independently from the collective leadership. The work of any member or department of the Party committee is carried out under the principles of collective guidance, collective supervision, and responsibility to the collective of the Party committee, and it is also carried out actively under the principle of complete consciousness and initiative of individual Party committee members. A division of labor and responsibility system that is separated from collective leadership will inevitably lead to decentralism; if Party committee members or departments have little or no such consciousness and initiative, collective leadership will be weak or even paralyzed.
    Thanks to the teachings of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party, the CPC Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee has made great efforts in implementing collective leadership and enhancing Party unity. We used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to strictly criticize complacency and individualism, opposed decentralism, further enhanced Party unity, especially the unity among key leading cadres, and improved the Party's collective leadership system.
    In the later stages of studying the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session and examining the issues of collective leadership and unity, the Municipal Party Committee, based on the instructions of higher authorities and the situation in the city, proposed to continue vigorously implementing the principle of collective leadership, overcoming decentralism, and at the same time, preventing and overcoming the phenomenon of not daring to independently take responsibility after decentralism has been opposed.
    Facts have proven that it was absolutely necessary for the Municipal Party Committee to raise this issue.
    Judging from the situation of some Party organizations, especially the Party organizations of some larger units, the spirit of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party has not been correctly and comprehensively implemented in all Party organizations and among Party leading cadres. Some responsible Party cadres have not practiced the Party's collective leadership principle, and the tendency of decentralism still exists in many units. For example, the phenomenon of the vice chairman of the trade union and the secretary of the Communist Youth League committee of the Shijiazhuang State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill seeking independence from the Party organization and violating the principle of collective leadership is serious. They turned a deaf ear to some resolutions and instructions of the Party organization at the same level, and even refused to accept the guidance of the Party organization on important issues. They regarded the workers' and youths' love for the organization as personal honor. The decentralism of the CPC Hebei Provincial Construction Engineering Bureau's Directly Subordinate Second Construction Company Committee is also serious. They rarely hold Party committee meetings. The Party committee is accustomed to letting its members divide up the work, and in reality, they often go their own way with little or no collective leadership. In many grassroots organizations in the city, the phenomenon of key Party committee cadres making decisions on their own is still relatively common. In many Party committees, some Party committee members only care about their assigned work and pay little attention to or are indifferent to the overall work of the Party committee or the work of other departments. They believe that as long as they have completed their assigned work, they have fulfilled all their responsibilities as a Party committee member. In essence, they have forgotten that they are a member of the collective of the Party committee and bear a high degree of political responsibility for all the work of the Party committee and the work of other departments; they also do not understand the organic connection between the various parts of the collective.
    After focusing on criticizing the tendencies of decentralism and individual decision-making on major issues within the Party, a situation that cannot be ignored at present is that not daring to independently take responsibility for solving problems in some leading cadres and work departments is one of the main problems existing in leadership work. It is an important factor causing some shortcomings in current leadership work. There are some leading cadres and work departments who, in order to avoid the mistake of decentralism, have gone to another extreme, that is, regardless of whether it is a major or minor matter, regardless of whether the Party committee has any principled regulations on such issues, they ask for instructions and report on almost everything; some leading cadres even take unimportant issues to the Party committee for discussion; some departments, in order to get "insurance," distribute all kinds of dispensable written reports and secondary or completely unnecessary documents to responsible comrades of the Party committee, seemingly respecting leadership, but in essence, shirking responsibility.
    The serious consequences of this are: the enthusiasm and initiative of some lower-level Party organizations and Party member cadres have been weakened, their dependence has increased, and their ability to work independently cannot be effectively improved. At the same time, the number of meetings of the higher-level Party committee has increased, the agenda items have increased, and the meeting time has also been prolonged. As a result of the increase in agenda items, the discussion time for important issues is occupied by secondary issues, and the depth of discussion on important issues is limited; many leading cadres have to spend a lot of time sitting in the meeting room, and besides attending meetings, most of their time is spent on reading documents, receiving cadres who come to ask for instructions or report problems, or answering questions on the phone. The Party committee secretary is particularly busy, and even ordinary cases of fighting and brawling are referred to the municipal Party committee secretary. As a result, the learning time of leading cadres is reduced, and the time to contact the masses and go deep into work is also reduced. Because the leading organs are mired in bureaucracy, they cannot implement effective guidance on some major issues. This seriously weakens the Party's collective leadership.
    The main reasons for this situation are, first, the Municipal Party Committee's implementation of the Party's collective leadership principle lacked sufficient awareness, prevention, and vigilance in this regard, and it did not emphasize the division of labor and responsibility under collective leadership enough, did not deeply and timely expose and criticize the erroneous ideas related to this aspect, and did not make corresponding resolutions. Second, we did not, on the basis of studying the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session and examining our work, further stipulate the specific system of requesting instructions and reporting to the Party Standing Committee or the Plenary Committee by the Party departments, members of the Municipal Party Committee, especially members of the Party Standing Committee, that is, which issues can be resolved by the Party departments or members of the Standing Committee without requesting instructions, and which issues must be submitted to the Party Standing Committee or the Plenary Committee for discussion and decision. Of course, it is difficult to formulate such a specific and detailed system at once, but we did not timely stipulate what needed to be and could be stipulated, which is indeed a shortcoming of the Party committee's leadership. Some Party committees often only make resolutions without designating the specific executor of the resolution or stipulating it clearly, which is also a reason for the above situation. Some cadres of factories, enterprises, or other work departments lack confidence in the instructions or regulations issued by the municipal-level competent departments regarding certain business issues, as if only obtaining a direct reply or instruction from the higher-level Party committee on these business issues counts as a final decision; and the Party committee's style of taking over everything has not been eradicated, which is also an important factor causing this phenomenon. Another important reason is that after opposing decentralism, an individualistic sentiment has grown in some cadres, and they are unwilling or afraid to take responsibility for their work, and they try to push away problems whenever they can, so that if something goes wrong in the future, they can shirk responsibility. They also call this approach "strengthening collective leadership," without considering that the result of doing so is precisely to weaken the Party's collective leadership. Obviously, these cadres completely do not understand the inseparable relationship between division of labor and responsibility and collective leadership.
    In order to implement the Party's collective leadership principle, we must constantly fight against the two undesirable tendencies of decentralism and irresponsibility. If we do not overcome decentralism, the Party's collective leadership principle will be undermined; similarly, if members and departments of the Party committee are unwilling or afraid to independently take responsibility, the Party's collective leadership principle will inevitably not be implemented. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly educate cadres and take appropriate measures to oppose both the tendency of decentralism and the tendency of irresponsibility, so as to ensure the correct realization of the collective leadership system.

    深入贯彻党的集体领导制
    中共石家庄市委副书记　董东
    党的领导的最高原则是领导的集体性，只有根据集体的政治经验和智慧，才能保证党的领导的正确，保证党的队伍的统一和团结，保证工人阶级、劳动人民和全体人民的团结，保证伟大的社会主义建设的胜利实现。
    健全党的集体领导，一方面要反对分散主义，反对个人决定问题，重大的问题一定要经过党的委员会的集体的研究讨论，慎重地作出决定，而后在全党贯彻执行；另一方面还要正确地贯彻集体领导
  下的分工负责制，使党委会的成员以及各个部门都能认真负责地担负起自己的工作，这是贯彻实现集体领导不可缺少的重要方面。如果没有正确的、经常的、健全的分工负责制，就不可能实现强有力的集体领导。这不但因为集体的决议，需要集中大家的经验和智慧；而且决议的贯彻，又要依靠集体的成员分工负责的认真进行。当然，分工负责决不是说个人或部门可以脱离集体的领导而独断专行。党委的任何一个成员或部门的工作都是在党委的集体指导、集体监督并对集体负责的原则之下进行的，同时也是在党委成员个人完全自觉和主动的原则下积极进行的。脱离了集体领导的分工负责制，必然要出现分散主义；党委的成员或部门没有或很少这种自觉性和主动性，集体领导便会软弱无力甚至瘫痪。
    由于党的四中全会决议的教导，中共石家庄市委员会在贯彻集体领导、增强党的团结方面，作了很大的努力。我们运用批评和自我批评的武器，严格地批判了骄傲自满情绪、个人主义，反对了分散主义，进一步增强了党的团结，特别是主要领导干部中间的团结，健全了党的集体领导制。
    市委在学习四中全会决议，检查集体领导和团结问题的后期，曾根据上级指示和本市情况提出了继续大力贯彻集体领导的原则，克服分散主义；同时，也要防止和克服在反对了分散主义之后可能出现的不敢独立负责的现象。
    事实证明，市委这样提出问题是完全必要的。
    从有些党组织特别是个别较大单位党组织的情况看：党的四中全会决议的精神还没有在所有的党组织和党的领导干部中正确地全面地贯彻，有些党的负责干部还没有身体力行地遵循党的集体领导原则，分散主义的倾向在不少单位还是存在的。如石家庄国营第一棉纺厂工会副主席和青年团委员会书记，向党组织闹独立性，违犯集体领导原则的现象是严重的。他们对同级党组织有些决议指示置若罔闻，甚至在重要问题上拒绝接受党组织的指导，他们把工人和青年群众对组织的爱戴，看成是个人的荣誉。中共河北省建筑工程局直属第二建筑公司委员会的分散主义也是严重的，他们很少举行党的委员会会议，党的委员会习惯于让自己的成员分兵把口，实际上是经常在很少或没有集体领导的状态下各行其是。市里的许多基层组织中，党委主要干部个人擅自决定问题的现象还是较为普遍的。在很多党的委员会中，一些党委委员只顾自己分工的工作，而对于党委的全面工作或其他部门工作不大关心或不闻不问的现象还不是个别的。他们认为只要完成了自己分工的工作，好像就已经尽到了作为一个党委委员的全部责任。实质上，他们忘掉了自己是党的委员会的集体中的一员，对党的委员会的全部工作和其他部门工作都负有高度的政治责任；他们也不了解集体的各部分之间的有机联系。
    在着重批判了党内的分散主义、个人决定重大问题的倾向后，目前一个不容忽视的情况是：在某些领导干部和工作部门中，不敢独立负责地解决问题，是领导工作当中存在的主要问题之一。它是造成当前领导工作中某些缺点的重要因素。有这样一些领导干部和工作部门，他们为了避免分散主义的错误又走到了另一个极端，就是不论大事小事，不管党委对于这类问题有无原则规定，几乎是事事请示，样样报告；有的领导干部甚至把不关重大的问题，也拿到党的委员会上去讨论；有些部门为了挂“保险号”，就把一些可有可无的书面报告和次要的或一些完全不必要的文件，一律分送党委负责同志，表面上好像是尊重领导，实质上是推卸责任。
    由此产生的严重结果是：有些下级党组织和党员干部的积极性和主动性削弱了，依赖思想增加了，独立工作的能力不能有效地提高。同时上级党委的会议次数增加了，议程项目增多了，会议时间也随着拖长了。议程项目增加的结果，使有关重大问题的讨论时间被次要问题侵占了，重要问题的讨论深度受到了限制；许多领导干部不得不用很多时间坐在会议室里，除了开会，多数时间只忙于看文件，接待来请示或报告问题的干部，或是接电话答复问题。其中特别忙的又是党委书记，甚至普通打架斗殴的案件也请示到市委书记那里。结果使领导干部的学习时间减少了，接触群众和深入工作的时间也减少了。领导机关因为陷于事务主义，对有些重大问题不能实行有力的指导。从而就严重地削弱了党的集体领导。
    出现这种情况的主要原因，首先是市委贯彻党的集体领导原则时，在这方面自觉防范和警惕不够，对于在集体领导下的分工负责制还强调得不够，没有深刻地及时地揭发和批判有关这一方面的错误思想，并作出相当的决议。其次，我们没有在学习四中全会决议检查工作的基础上，进一步规定出党委部门、市委委员特别是党的常务委员对党的常务委员会或全体委员会的具体的请示报告制度，即哪些是党委部门或常委个人不必请示即可解决的问题，哪些是属于必须提交党的常委会或全体委员会讨论决定的问题。当然一下拟定这样一个具体的周密的制度是有困难的，但对需要而且可能规定的也没有及时规定出来，这确实是党委领导方面的一个缺点。有些党的委员会常常只作决议，而没有指定决议的具体执行者或规定得不明确，这也是造成以上情况的一个原因。有些工厂企业或其他工作部门的干部，对市级主管部门发布的有关某些业务问题的指示或规定信任不足，好像对这些业务问题只有取得上级党委的直接答复或指示才算定案；而党委包办代替作风没有得到根除，也是造成这种现象的重要因素。另外一个重要的原因是，反对分散主义之后，在部分干部中滋长着一种个人主义情绪，他们对工作不愿或不敢负责，遇到问题能推就推，以便将来工作万一发生问题，自己可以推卸责任。他们把这种作法也叫做“加强集体领导”，而没有考虑到这样作的结果恰恰是削弱了党的集体领导，显然，这些干部完全不懂得分工负责和集体领导二者间的不可分割的关系。
    为了贯彻党的集体领导原则，必须经常对分散主义和不负责任两种不良倾向进行斗争。如果不去克服分散主义，党的集体领导原则就会遭到破坏；同样的，如果党委的成员和部门不愿或不敢独立负责，党的集体领导原则也就必然无法贯彻。因此，必须在干部中经常不断地进行教育，并且采取适当措施，既要反对分散主义的倾向，又要反对不负责任的倾向，以保证集体领导制的正确实现。
