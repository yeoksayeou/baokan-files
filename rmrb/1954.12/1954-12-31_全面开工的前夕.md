On December 13th, I visited the Huangguangtun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Shenyang, which is undergoing reconstruction. According to national requirements, the factory's reconstruction project should be put into production on January 1st of next year. Comrades in charge of capital construction enthusiastically introduced the factory's construction situation and led me to visit the completed factory buildings.

This factory is being reconstructed according to the socialist principles of specialized production. It breaks away from the comprehensive situation of China's railway repair factories, which "can do everything but are not specialized," and begins to move towards the specialization of repairing freight cars. The entire factory's production procedures, equipment arrangement, and technical standards are all centered around the fixed task of "specializing in repairing freight cars." This will allow for the accumulation of experience, the improvement of technical levels, and the guarantee of improved quality and reduced costs. Therefore, after the visit, everyone was excited, and the first pressing question was:

	"When will it be officially put into production!"

	"We can complete the project according to plan, but we cannot put it into production," the person in charge of the management office said bluntly. As I understand it, the factory can fully achieve the goal of officially starting production on January 1st according to plan. In November, the civil engineering, water and gas pipeline projects, and most of the machine installation projects were basically completed. But why can't it be put into production now?

The comrades from the management office raised some issues. These issues may seem small, but if any of them are not resolved in a timely manner, they are enough to disrupt the realization of the plan.

	"Most of the machines have been installed, but the vertical drilling machine allocated to us by the Tianjin Base Material Factory of the Ministry of Railways from a local state-owned factory in Kaifeng was shipped on the 18th to Shenyang, and its whereabouts are still unknown. We are looking for it everywhere now. The Shenyang Base Material Factory is responsible for supplying six transformers, but two of them are already broken, one was damaged during transportation, and the other has a piece of paint chipped off from the porcelain bottle, and repairs have not yet begun.

	"Low-voltage switches are electrical equipment used for lighting, and these were ordered from the Low-Voltage Switch Factory. We requested delivery in December, but they only promised delivery in the first quarter of next year. This will affect the electricity use of the already completed production workshops, and the newly built 14,000 square meters of staff dormitories will also be affected because the electricity bureau refuses to connect the lines.

	"Although the above two things are not good, the biggest problem now is the electricity used for production. In June, we determined to use 6.6 kV voltage. The electricity bureau responsible for erecting transmission lines and supplying electricity signed two agreements with us. Both agreements were signed in the spirit of ensuring that the entire project could use electricity for production on January 1st. However, the electricity bureau only started digging trenches and laying cables on December 6th. Why didn't they start in October? At that time, the ground was not frozen, and work efficiency could have been increased by at least two times. Now, they still cannot fully guarantee electricity before the end of December. The comrades from the electricity bureau often propose to stop the power supply during the New Year to connect the wires, which may disrupt the plan to put the factory into production on January 1st. This matter is now a critical issue."

When the reporter called the electricity bureau, a comrade from the planning team of the electricity bureau's contracting department replied: "We have an agreement between the two parties, which stipulates that electricity will be supplied in the first quarter of next year. It does not specify whether it is at the beginning or the end of the first quarter. We can only act in accordance with the agreement."

What is the truth of the matter?

The electricity bureau's contracted project is to connect the external lines with the internal lines to ensure power supply. The total investment in the project is 600 million yuan, which is a very small amount in the overall project investment. However, this small project has brought great trouble to the entire construction. Let's take a look at the progress of this 600 million yuan project.

From a timeline perspective, they began studying the power supply issue in early May and signed a power supply agreement in June. The agreement stipulated that "the expansion of the North Factory (referring to the newly expanded factory) from the first quarter of 1955 shall be supplied by Party B (referring to the electricity bureau) from the existing Huangtie ordinary line within the load limit specified in the attached table." The attached table "Equipment Expansion Capacity and Completion Year Quarter" specifies the capacity and states that the above power supply project should be "completed in the fourth quarter of 1954." Now the entire project is in danger of not being completed within the year, so some comrades from the electricity bureau have changed their tone and said, "The contract stipulates the first quarter of 1955, and it is not too late for us to complete it within March." In this way, a mutually signed agreement has resulted in two completely different conclusions.

Comrade Wang Hongfei, who is responsible for signing contracts at the factory, said: "I clearly know that the factory will start production on January 1st, how can I ask the other party to supply power during the New Year?" "At that time, we clearly requested power supply in the fourth quarter for partial trial runs. This requirement is clearly printed on the attached table preserved by both parties." "We believe that the phrase 'from the first quarter of 1955' specified in the agreement refers to January 1st. The comrades from the electricity bureau believe that it does not mean January 1st, but any day within the first quarter." This is obviously far-fetched because, first, the attached table clearly stipulates power supply in the fourth quarter of this year; second, the power consumption capacity specified in the attached table for 1955 is exactly the same as that for 1956. If it is not from January 1st, the factory would not need so much capacity of electricity in 1955.

Why did such a dispute occur? The fundamental problem is that the Electricity Bureau's contracting department wasted the good construction time. Now that it is freezing cold and the end of the year is approaching, they have to resort to the ambiguous phrase "from the first quarter of 1955" in the contract.

How was the time wasted?

The two parties signed a power supply agreement in June, and on July 12th, the factory registered the project name and application with the electricity bureau, entrusting them to be responsible for design and construction. The electricity bureau came to investigate in August, which took a total of three and a half months. It was not until October 27th that they submitted the design and bill of materials, and it was not until November 8th that they calculated the money for the factory to pay. After the payment, construction should have started immediately, but it was delayed until November 29th before the agreement to lay the cable project was signed. The agreement stipulated that construction would be completed "from December 3rd to December 27th," but because construction was delayed until the coldest weather, a sentence was added below the completion date: "Working days shall not be recorded when the temperature is below minus 10 degrees Celsius." But, in fact, work did not start on December 3rd. The electricity bureau sent a letter to the factory on the 4th, writing: "After our coordination with the labor bureau, it has been decided to send 30 to 40 people to your factory on the 6th of this month to excavate and lay cables. We hope you can prepare 30 picks and 4 shovels." It turns out that the biggest characteristic of this contracting unit is that it has nothing; the client has to prepare the materials themselves (such as jacks, sleepers, cables), take care of the equipment, and provide the tools. These requirements were not put forward all at once, but one by one, which greatly delayed the construction time.

Now, the Shenyang Electricity Bureau has agreed to supply electricity from January 1, 1955, which is good. We hope that it can be guaranteed.

It should be admitted that the factory construction department itself also has some problems in this regard. The biggest problem is that it did not consider production preparations thoroughly. For example, the high-voltage switch factory notified them in early December to pick up the customized high-voltage switchgear. However, they did not seize the opportunity, and as a result, it was taken away by someone else, leaving them helpless. There is also some disconnect between capital construction and production. Production operators have not yet been transferred to the site, and some technicians still need to be recruited temporarily. Some comrades believe that the production tasks for next year have not been finalized, and therefore they have more or less relaxed their efforts in preparing for production. This is not right. The capital construction department should make all production preparations before completion, which is a guarantee for smooth entry into production.

The comrades of the Huangguantun Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory should continue to work hard and complete the entire project by the prepared date, guaranteeing completion before the end of the year. The factory needs to carefully check all loopholes, consider and solve all problems from a production perspective, and achieve smooth completion and successful production. At the same time, we also ask the low-voltage switch factory and the Shenyang Electricity Bureau to provide them with practical support, because ensuring that the factory is put into production on time is the common responsibility of all relevant departments, and completing the country's construction and production tasks is everyone's common glory.

    全面开工的前夕
    本报记者　安岗
    十二月十三日，我访问了改建中的沈阳皇姑屯机车车辆修理工厂。这个工厂的改建工程按照国家要求，要在明年一月一日投入生产。担任基本建设工作的同志们热情地介绍了建厂情况。领我参观了已经完工的各个厂房。
    这个工厂是按照社会主义组织生产的专业化原则进行改建的；它打破了我国铁路修理工厂“样样皆行，不能专业”的综合性状况，开始走向修理货车的专业。整个工厂的生产程序、设备安排和技术标准都是围绕着“专修货车”这一固定任务来进行的，这样，就可以积累经验，提高技术水平，保证提高质量和降低成本。因此，当人们参观后，心情都是兴奋的，大家第一个迫切的问题就是：
      “什么时候正式投入生产啊！”
    “我们可以按计划完工，但不能投入生产。”管理处的负责同志直截了当地这样说。据我了解，这个工厂完全可以作到按计划，保证在一月一日正式生产。十一月份，基本上完成了土建、风水管工程和大部分机器安装工程。可是现在为什么还不能投入生产呢？
    管理处的同志们提出了一些事，这些事看起来都不大，但他们之中每一件事如得不到及时解决，都足以破坏计划的实现。
    “机器大部分是安装起来了，可是铁道部天津基地材料厂从开封某地方国营工厂拨给我们的立钻车床十八日发车运沈阳，到现在不知去向；现在正到处找。沈阳基地材料厂负责供应六台变压器，现在已经坏了两台，一台是运坏了，一台是瓷瓶掉了一块漆，还没有着手修理。
    “低压开关是照明用的电器设备，这是在低压开关厂订货的。我们要求十二月交货，他们只答应明年第一季度交货，这样一来，现在已经完全完工的生产厂房用电就要受影响，新盖好的一万四千平方公尺的职工宿舍，由于电业局不给接线也影响使用。
    “以上两件事虽然不妙，但现在最大的问题还是生产上的用电问题。我们六月份确定使用六、六千伏的电压，负责架设输电线与送电的电业局和我们订了两次协议，无论那次协议，都是根据保证使全部工程能在一月一日用电生产的精神签订的。到十二月六日，电业局才开始挖沟，铺设电缆。为什么十月份不动手呢？那时地没冻，工作效率至少可提高两倍。现在，他们还不能完全保证在十二月底以前用电，电业局同志经常提出要在过年时停电接火，这样一来，就可能把一月一日投入生产的计划打乱了。这件事，现在已经是一个关键问题了。”
    记者打电话问电业局，电业局承制部计划组的同志回答说：“我们双方订有协议，规定明年第一季度送电，是第一季度季初还是季末，并没有规定。我们只能按照协议办事。”
    事情的真相是怎样呢？
    电业局承装的工程是把外线同内线连结起来，保证送电，全部工程投资额是六亿元，这在整个工程投资额中是一个极小的数目。可是，这个不大的工程却给整个建设带来极大的麻烦。请看这六亿元的工程的进展情形吧。
    从时间上看，他们在五月初起就开始研究电源问题，六月签订了供电协议，协议中规定：“北厂
  （按即新扩建的工厂）扩建部分自一九五五年第一季度起乙方（按指电业局）应允由现有皇铁普通线在附表规定的负荷限度内供电”，协议后面的附表
  “设备扩充容量及完成年份季度”一项中，规定了容量并写明以上供电工程应在“一九五四年第四季度完成”。现在整个工程有在年内完不成的危险，因此，电业局一些同志也就改变口吻说：“合同上规定的是一九五五年第一季度，我们就在三月份内完工也并不晚。”这样一来，一个双方签订的协议却得出了两个完全不同的结论。
    工厂负责订合同的王鸿飞同志说：“我明明知道工厂是一月一日生产，怎能要求对方过年再供电”，“当时我们明明要求四季度供电，进行局部试车，这个要求清清楚楚印在双方保存的附表上”，
  “我们认为协议上规定的‘从一九五五年第一季度起’，就是指的一月一日。电业局的同志认为不是一月一日，而是第一季度内的任何一个日子送电”。这显然是很勉强的，因为，第一，附表内明明规定着今年第四季度供电，第二，附表内规定的一九五五年用电容量同一九五六年是完全一样的，如果不是从一月一日起，一九五五年工厂就不会需要这么多容量的电了。
    为什么发生这么一个争执呢？基本问题是电业局承装部把大好的施工建设时间给浪费掉了。到现在，天寒地冻，年关临头，只好求助于合同上的
  “从一九五五年第一季度起”这一句含糊话了。
    时间怎样浪费的呢？
    六月双方签订了供电协议，七月十二日工厂在电业局登记了工程名目和申请，委托他们负责设计和施工。电业局八月来调查，一共用了三个半月。到了十月二十七日才交出设计和材料明细表，到了十一月八日算出钱来由工厂交款，交款后本应即行施工，结果又拖到十一月二十九日，才签订铺设电缆工程的协议，协议中规定：“从十二月三日到十二月二十七日”施工完毕，可是因为拖到最冷的天气来施工，只好又在竣工日期下面加了一句：“在摄氏零下十度时不得记入工作日”。但，实际上十二月三日并没有动手，电业局四日给工厂来了一封信，写道：“经我们和劳动局调配联系结果，已决定本月六日前往贵厂挖掘电缆敷设备，约计三十人到四十人，希给予准备洋镐三十把，铁锹四把”。原来这个承包单位最大的特点是什么都没有，要甲方自己准备材料（如千斤，道木，电缆），保管设备，代备工具等。这些要求不是一下子提出，而是一个一个地提出，这就大大耽误了建设的时间。
    现在，沈阳电业局已答应从一九五五年一月一日起供电，这是好的，希望能够保证实现。
    应当承认，工厂建设部门本身在这方面也是有些问题的。最大的问题是对生产准备考虑不周。如高压开关厂在十二月初曾通知他们去取订制的高压开关柜。而他们没有抓紧，结果被别人提走，弄得束手无策。基本建设与生产之间也有某些脱节，生产操作工人至今尚未调到现场，有些技术工人还要临时招募。有的同志认为明年生产任务尚未最后确定，因而多多少少放松了对生产准备工作的努力。这是不应该的。基本建设部门完工前应当作好一切生产准备工作，这是顺利进入生产的保证。
    皇姑屯机车车辆修理工厂的同志们应该继续努力毫不懈怠地把整个工程按照准备的日期，保证在年底以前完成。工厂有必要周密地检查一切漏洞，更多地从生产着眼去考虑和解决一切问题，作到顺利完工和胜利生产。同时，我们也要求低压开关厂和沈阳市电业局给他们以实际的支援，因为，保证工厂按时投入生产是一切有关部门的共同责任，完成国家的建设和生产任务是大家共同的光荣。
