    The statement by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai regarding the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" once again solemnly demonstrates to the world the firm will of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, oppose aggression, and safeguard peace. I, on behalf of the national industrialists and businessmen, warmly support this just statement.
    We resolutely oppose the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek with extreme anger. This treaty is the most shameless traitorous treaty in which the Chiang gang openly sells out Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. It is an aggressive treaty by the U.S. aggressor bloc to occupy our territory Taiwan indefinitely, infringe upon our sovereignty, and interfere in our internal affairs. It is a war treaty by the U.S. aggressor bloc that tears up international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, violates the United Nations Charter, and undermines Asian and world peace. We resolutely oppose this treaty that undermines peace and provokes war.
    Taiwan is our sacred territory, and we must liberate Taiwan. We will never allow the United States to occupy Taiwan, nor will we allow the use of so-called Taiwan "independent country," Taiwan "neutralization," or "trusteeship" methods to invade Taiwan and sever our sovereignty and territory. We must liberate Taiwan from the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, complete our complete unification, and safeguard Asian and world peace. We must stop the United States from occupying our territory of Taiwan and oppose the United States from infringing upon our sovereignty and interfering in our internal affairs. The United States must withdraw all aggressive armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait. We will not stop until we achieve our goal.
    Our people love peace and never threaten others, but we are never afraid of the threats of any enemy. We resolutely oppose war, but we are never afraid of resisting aggression. If the U.S. aggressors dare to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan, we will make them suffer a crushing defeat.
    In the great struggle against the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" and for the liberation of Taiwan, our national industrialists and businessmen must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen our confidence, heighten our vigilance, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, resolutely expose and crush all conspiracies and sabotage activities of U.S.-Chiang spies and special agents. At the same time, we should further promote the spirit of patriotism, love our motherland, abide by laws and decrees, actively operate, work hard to produce, and contribute all our strength to resolutely fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan, against U.S. aggression, and to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique!

    全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通的谈话
    周恩来外交部长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，再一次郑重地向全世界表明了我国人民解放台湾、反对侵略、保卫和平的坚强意志，我代表全国工商业者热烈拥护这一正义的声明。
    对于美蒋签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，我们以极大的愤怒坚决反对。这个条约是蒋贼公开出卖台湾和澎湖的最无耻的卖国条约，是美国侵略集团无限期霸占我国领土台湾、侵犯我国主权、干涉我国内政的侵略条约，是美国侵略集团撕毁开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和日本投降条款等国际协议，违反联合国宪章、破坏亚洲和平与世界和平的战争条约。我们坚决反对这个破坏和平挑起战争的条约。
    台湾是我国神圣的领土，我们一定要解放台湾。我们决不容许美国霸占台湾，也决不容许用所谓台湾“独立国”、台湾“中立化”和“托管”的办法来侵占台湾，割裂我国的主权和领土。我们一定要把台湾从蒋介石卖国集团的血腥统治下解放出来，完成我国的完全统一，维护亚洲及世界和平。我们一定要制止美国霸占我国领土台湾，反对美国侵犯我国的主权、干涉我国的内政。美国必须从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走一切侵略武装。不达目的决不休止。
    我们人民是热爱和平的，从来不威胁别人，但我们决不怕任何敌人的威胁；我们坚决反对战争，但我们从来不怕反抗侵略。如果美国侵略者敢于阻挠我们解放台湾，我们一定要使它碰得头破血流。
    在反对美蒋“共同防御条约”和解放台湾的伟大斗争中，我全国工商业者必须更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席周围，坚定信心，提高警惕，分清敌我，坚决揭发和粉碎美蒋间谍、特务的一切阴谋和破坏活动，同时，我们应更高度地发挥爱国主义精神，爱护祖国，遵守法令，积极经营，努力生产，贡献一切力量，为解放台湾、反对美国侵略、消灭蒋介石卖国集团而坚决斗争到底！
