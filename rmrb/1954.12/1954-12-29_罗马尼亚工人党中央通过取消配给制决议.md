Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 27th: According to the Romanian News Agency, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party held a plenary session in Bucharest on the 25th. The meeting discussed and unanimously adopted the resolution proposed by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and the Council of Ministers regarding the abolition of the rationing system starting from December 26th.

The resolution pointed out: Due to the successful implementation of the tasks put forward by the enlarged plenary session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party in August 1953, this year's grain output increased by more than 9 million tons compared with 1953. The consumer goods industry has also made great achievements in terms of output and quality. The turnover of socialist commerce, calculated at comparable prices, has increased from 15 billion lei (Romanian currency) in 1952 to 22 billion lei this year. The total amount of agricultural products supplied to the market by agricultural producers has also increased. Therefore, Romania has the necessary conditions to abolish the rationing system. Starting from December 26, 1954, grain and industrial products will be traded on the market at unified national prices.

The resolution concluded: The transition from rationing to market trade is an event of great significance in the development of Romania's national economy and the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the working people.

    罗马尼亚工人党中央通过取消配给制决议
    【新华社二十八日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特二十七日讯：罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会二十五日在布加勒斯特举行了全体会议。会议讨论并且一致通过了工人党中央和部长会议所提出的关于从十二月二十六日开始取消配给制的决议。
    决议指出：由于胜利执行罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会一九五三年八月扩大全体会议所提出的任务，今年的谷物产量比一九五三年增加了九百多万吨，消费品工业在产量和质量方面也取得了巨大的成绩，社会主义商业的商品流转额，按比较价格计算，已经从一九五二年的一百五十亿列伊（罗币名）增加到今年的二百二十亿列伊。农业生产者供应市场的农产品总量也增加了。因此，罗马尼亚已经具备了取消配给制的必要条件。从一九五四年十二月二十六日开始按照国家统一价格在市场扩大粮食和工业品的贸易。
    决议最后说：从配给制过渡到市场贸易——这是发展罗马尼亚国民经济、提高劳动人民物质和文化生活水平方面的具有重要意义的事件。
