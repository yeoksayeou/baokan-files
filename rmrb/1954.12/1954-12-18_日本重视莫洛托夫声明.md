    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 17th: Tokyo newspapers this morning prominently published on the first page, with banner headlines, the statement by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov regarding relations with Japan.

    Kyodo News, reporting on the reaction of the Foreign Ministry authorities, said: "In sharp contrast to their previous offhand dismissal of similar Soviet proposals as mere 'peace offensive' propaganda, they tend to believe that Molotov's statement has serious significance."  Tokuji Tokonami, Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, believed that the statement offered hope and might pave the way for Japan and the "Communist camp" to develop trade and restore normal relations.  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the statement might become the starting point for adjusting Japanese-Soviet relations. The spokesman also said, however, that Japan must be "cautious" in its diplomatic actions.

    Tadatake Sata, Director of the Left-wing Socialist Party's Foreign Affairs Bureau, said that in response to the Soviet Foreign Minister's statement, Japan should begin negotiations with the Soviet Union to normalize relations.

    Meanwhile, Secretary-General of the Liberal Party, Mitsujiro Ishii, dismissed the statement as "nothing more than propaganda."

    日本重视莫洛托夫声明
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：十七日早晨，东京各报都以通栏标题在第一版显著地位刊载了苏联外交部长莫洛托夫关于对日本关系的声明。
    共同社报道外务省当局的反应时说：“和他们以前轻描淡写地把苏联类似的建议贬为只是‘和平攻势’宣传的态度成一尖锐的对照，他们倾向于认为莫洛托夫声明有认真的意义。”外务省政务次官床次德二认为：这个声明提供了希望，它可能为日本和“共产党阵营”发展贸易和恢复正常联系铺平道路。外务省发言人说：这个声明也许可能成为调整日苏关系的起点。发言人又说：不过，日本在外交行动上必须“谨慎”。
    左派社会党外交局长佐多忠隆说：为响应苏联外交部长的声明，日本应当和苏联开始谈判，以使关系正常化。
    同时，自由党干事长石井光次郎却把这个声明说成“只不过是宣传”。
