Xinhua News Agency, December 7th, Tokyo Dispatch: Currently, the number of signatures collected throughout Japan demanding a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs has reached over nineteen million. This figure was announced by Iku Yasui, Secretary-General of the National Council for the Signature Campaign to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, at a meeting held in Tokyo on the 5th.

The movement to demand a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs has become a nationwide movement in Japan. All local assemblies throughout Japan have, without exception, passed resolutions demanding a ban on atomic weapons. People from all kinds of organizations and social strata in various regions have enthusiastically participated in the signature campaign. For example, in Koga City, Ibaraki Prefecture, with a population of only about 34,000, more than 24,000 people participated in the signature campaign; in Tokyo, the number of participants also accounted for about 30 percent of the total population.

In order to expand the influence of the movement to demand a ban on atomic weapons, the National Council for the Signature Campaign to Ban Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs has decided to start issuing appeals for a ban on atomic and hydrogen bombs to all international conferences from next year.

Xinhua News Agency, December 4th, Tokyo Dispatch: Fishermen in Kisarazu City, Chiba Prefecture, are opposing the US Air Force's plan to reclaim land from the sea to expand the runway of the US military airport there. The expansion area will reach 330,000 square yards. Local fishermen say that this plan of the US Air Force will destroy nearby fishing grounds and threaten the livelihoods of 2,000 fishermen.

At the same time, the Fukuoka City authorities in the Kyushu region and Japan Airlines are also opposing the US Air Force's ban on Japanese civilian airlines from using Itazuke Airport in the future. A statement issued by the US Far East Air Force authorities on the 3rd revealed that this ban is to strengthen Itazuke Air Force Base.

    日本近二千万人签名要求禁止原子武器
    日本渔民和航空公司反对美国空军扩建基地和独占机场
    【新华社七日讯】东京消息：日本全国要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的签名，目前已经达到一千九百多万——这个数字是日本禁止原子弹和氢弹签名运动全国协议会事务局长安井郁于五日在东京举行的一次会议上宣布的。
    要求禁止原子弹和氢弹的运动，在日本已经成为全民性的运动。日本全国所有的地方议会都毫无例外地通过了要求禁止原子武器的决议。各地各种团体和阶层的人，热烈地参加了签名。如人口仅有三万四千人左右的茨城县古河市，参加签名的人就有两万四千多名；东京都参加签名的人数也占全体市民的百分之三十左右。
    为了扩大要求禁止原子武器运动的影响，日本禁止原子弹和氢弹签名运动全国协议会决定，要从明年开始向所有国际性会议发出禁止原子弹和氢弹的呼吁。
    【新华社四日讯】东京消息：日本千叶县木更津市渔民正在反对美国空军想为当地美军飞机场填海扩建通海跑道的计划。扩建的面积将达三十三万平方码。当地渔民说，美国空军的这个计划将破坏附近的渔场，威胁两千个渔民的生活。
    同时，九州地方福冈市当局和日本航空公司也正在反对美国空军禁止日本民间航空公司今后再使用板付飞机场。美国远东空军当局三日发表的声明透露，它的这个禁令是为了加强板付空军基地。
