    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 23rd: TASS reported that on September 25th, N.S. Khrushchev met with British scientist and public figure, Professor John Bernal, winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening International Peace".
    A few days ago, Professor Bernal published excerpts from his conversation with N.S. Khrushchev in the London "Times". The full transcript of the conversation is as follows:
    Q: The Soviet Union's new agricultural policy has aroused various comments abroad, and this policy is often said to be a reflection of a new agricultural crisis and the failure of the collectivization system. The great attention paid to agriculture, many new resolutions, and even the agricultural exhibition itself are all regarded as proof of this view. For example, the rapid land reclamation work in Siberia and Kazakhstan is considered to be evidence of a serious situation. Therefore, I hope that you, as largely responsible for the new approach, will talk about the main political considerations when formulating the new policy.
    A: I think you have read the materials published in the newspapers about the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the further development of Soviet agriculture. These resolutions have aroused many comments abroad. The enemies of the Soviet Union are trying to use our criticism of the shortcomings in agriculture to achieve their own goals and interpret this criticism with their own ideas.
    Indeed, we sharply criticized the shortcomings in our agriculture. But we do not indulge in self-pity arising from some morbid sense of regret. We do this because severe criticism will help all our staff to understand and recognize our weaknesses more clearly, work better and eliminate shortcomings more quickly.
    Based on the achievements in the country's industrialization, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has put forward the task of ensuring a sharp increase in the production of consumer goods in the next two or three years. Needless to say, to increase the production of these consumer goods, it is necessary to accelerate the development of agriculture, especially to greatly increase grain production.
    Many people abroad are talking about the apparent contradiction between what J.V. Stalin said at the 18th Party Congress and G.M. Malenkov said at the 19th Party Congress that our country's grain problem had been solved, and the resolutions passed by the recent plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which pointed out the necessity of increasing grain production and expanding the grain sowing area in wasteland. In fact, there is no contradiction here. It was entirely correct for J.V. Stalin and G.M. Malenkov to say that we already had enough grain to supply the residents with the bread they needed. Our country has met its needs for bread. Now, we also have enough bread, and also the necessary reserves. But people do not live by bread alone. And it is precisely the other needs of the people that indirectly require an increase in grain production.
    The development of the Soviet Union, the consolidation of the Soviet economy, and the growth of the welfare of the working people on this basis, have greatly increased the demand for various goods that we could not produce in large quantities before in recent years. Our country reduces prices every year, the real wages of workers and staff are constantly increasing, and the purchasing power of residents is constantly increasing. Obviously, under such circumstances, the demand for low-quality goods will continue to decrease, while the demand for high-quality goods will greatly increase. More and more people go to stores to buy exquisite items. When prices were still high not long after the war, the supply of consumer goods to residents seemed barely enough. Since prices have been greatly reduced in the past few years, it is felt that some goods are slightly lacking, although in fact the output of all these goods has increased considerably. The broad masses of residents demand goods of better quality. We have the task of meeting this requirement.
    Under the capitalist system, such a situation—an increase in the demand for goods and a shortage of supply—would provide a great opportunity to make profits. However, the situation in our country is different. The socialist path is to develop production and continue to implement the policy of reducing prices. We should look at the apparent shortage of grain from this perspective.
    There is no crisis at all here. In our country, the situation is not worse than ever before, but better. The problem is that as we develop to a higher stage, the demand for consumer goods has greatly increased.
    Our Party has consistently and unswervingly pursued the policy of increasing the production of consumer goods in various ways and maximizing the satisfaction of the growing needs of the working people. In order to improve the level of commodity production, it is necessary to improve the level of grain production. Because, after all, grain is the basis of all other food, and grain is also the basis for the production of many other consumer goods. In order to obtain more grain, it has been decided to utilize the wasteland of Kazakhstan and Siberia—large fertile plains suitable for growing grain.
    These new fields produce the cheapest grain for us. The areas where wasteland is being reclaimed are actually continuous plains. If the people who cultivate the fields there start cultivating the land after breakfast, eat lunch when they start turning around, then it is just right for dinner when they return, this is not an exaggeration. The cost of producing grain there is the lowest, so it is beneficial for us to grow grain in those areas.
    This task will be completed in two years. We originally planned to reclaim 13 million hectares of wasteland. This plan is being fulfilled victoriously: more than 3.5 million hectares of wasteland were sown in 1954, and the total area of wasteland that has been reclaimed and prepared for sowing next year exceeds 17 million hectares. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union have revised the original plan, and taking into account the existing potential, decided to increase the area of wasteland planted with grain to 28 million to 30 million hectares in 1956. As long as there is a yield of at least 10 quintals per hectare, these lands will produce a total of about 300 million quintals or 1.8 billion poods of grain. This is the minimum number, because the yield per unit area of these lands is often three times this number.
    After reclaiming these wastelands, our country will be able to obtain enough grain to meet all the needs of the residents, ensure the development of animal husbandry, ensure exports and establish necessary reserves. We can give greater assistance to friendly countries such as Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic, which cannot produce enough grain on the lands, and Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria, which cannot fully meet their own needs in years of poor harvests.
    After increasing grain production, we can also use more grain as feed for livestock, which will increase the number of pigs and other livestock, and make the livestock fatter, that is to say, turn grain into meat. There is a saying in Ukraine: "There is no better bird than pork sausage." We hope to obtain more of this "bird" by increasing grain production.
    Reclaiming new land will help us increase the production of livestock feed more quickly. We will be able to allocate more land to grow feed crops. This will make it possible to increase milk production, increase the number of sheep and increase wool production.
    Moreover, the increased grain production on wasteland will enable us to allocate a part of the land in other regions of our country that is used to grow grain to grow other important crops.
    I have said that we now need many other products besides bread. We can obtain these products by expanding the sowing area of other crops in the already reclaimed areas.
    Take sugar as an example. We need more sugar, and we will be able to obtain more sugar by allocating about 300,000 hectares of land in Ukraine to grow sugar beets in addition to the land already used to grow sugar beets in Ukraine. The same is true for cotton, vegetables and other crops that require more water and management. Now, it will be possible to expand the sowing area of industrial raw material crops by reducing the sowing area of grain in areas with a relatively small population.
    Therefore, our task is to use new sources of grain to improve the food supply for residents.
    Of course, you can ask: if these treasures—that is, wasteland—have been at our doorstep all along, why didn't we think of them before? The people thought of them long ago—as early as ancient times before the revolution. Even the Tsar planned to utilize this fertile land. But this was impossible. This was also impossible in the first few decades after the establishment of the Soviet regime, when we did not have a fully developed agricultural machinery manufacturing industry. The area of land reclaimed in two years will be equal to the current total sown area of Ukraine, and will be 50 percent larger than its grain sown area. To reclaim these lands requires tens of millions of farmers, but so many people cannot be found.
    Only now, when socialist industry has developed, when the Soviet machinery manufacturing industry has reached its current scale, is it possible to reclaim such vast lands with relatively few people.
    In 1954, 120,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 10,000 combines and many other machines were sent to reclaim wasteland. It should be pointed out that allocating these machines does not require expanding the agricultural machinery production plan. When making the resolution on this plan, we called on people to volunteer to participate in land reclamation work; about tens of thousands of people were needed to reclaim wasteland, but soon after the call was issued, the number of people who volunteered to participate in land reclamation in response to the Party's call greatly exceeded the number we needed. With machines and people, there is nothing that can stop us from getting as much grain as we need.
    We have not forgotten our well-developed areas either. You visited the agricultural exhibition, didn't you? This exhibition is not held for entertainment. We use it to show the achievements of the best collective farms in various regions. The farmers go there to visit, they study there and begin to realize that they can also achieve the same results. Our task is to consolidate the collective farm, which is the unchanging basis of socialist agriculture, by all means. We want to raise ordinary collective farms to the level of the most advanced collective farms. This exhibition is a true people's university.
    Q: One of the striking features of this exhibition is that it attaches great importance to the development of rural power stations. These rural power stations are relatively small, and in my opinion, are uneconomical, because the electricity they produce is much more expensive than the electricity obtained from the large power stations you are now building. Given this, why are you still doing this?
    A: You are absolutely right, the electricity from small power stations is much more expensive than the electricity from large power stations. But despite this, building small power stations is still beneficial to collective farms. It should be considered that in our country, despite the large-scale power station construction in the post-war years, there is still a shortage of electricity. The electricity produced by large power stations is almost entirely used by industry. Obviously, the electricity needs of industry must be met first. Therefore, until now, agriculture has received very little electricity from large power stations.
    Collective farms are building small power stations because the electricity they generate is always cheaper than the electricity obtained from the simple generators used in agriculture.
    Due to the construction of power stations, even small power stations, collective farms can improve the level of agricultural mechanization and electrification, and can not only use electricity to supply household needs, but also, in particular, rely on it to use electricity-powered agricultural machines. Therefore, the practice of building power stations with small generating capacity is correct, because these power stations can meet the urgent needs of collective farms.
    In the future, with the development of the country's electrification cause, large power stations will supply more electricity to agriculture, and they have already begun to do so.
    Q: Your emphasis on land reclamation naturally raises the question: does this mean canceling or at least reducing the huge irrigation projects and other projects in the southeastern region of the Soviet Union to prevent drought? Currently, the development of Asia seems to be given more attention than the development of Europe. To what extent is this correct, and what are the reasons for doing so?
    A: This is a very reasonable question, but the answer is simple. We stipulate that we must not only develop this or that region within the country, but also develop the entire Soviet Union, depending on our current needs and available resources. For example, we want to increase the production of agricultural products. This can be achieved by more finely utilizing the existing sowing area and by reclaiming new land.
    We are trying our best to increase the output of agricultural products in various regions. In order to greatly increase output, we need a large amount of fertilizer, so many new factories must be built. All of this takes time, and we cannot wait. Currently, as I have already said, the economic benefits obtained from utilizing new land are the greatest. Reclaiming these new lands is the best way to quickly increase grain production. But we will not only expand the sowing area, but we will also strive for further intensive cultivation.
    Does this mean that we will cancel or reduce irrigation projects? Absolutely not. Irrigation projects will be carried out, and are being carried out in places where irrigation is most beneficial to the production of important crops (vegetables, cotton and grapes). But, for the time being, we are not preparing to focus on this.
    For the time being, we must concentrate our energy on where we can get the greatest harvest. This is merely a matter of calculating economic benefits and potential. Where is it best for us to send a new tractor today? Should it be sent to the old land, to let it cultivate ten hectares a day, or should it be sent to the new land, to let this tractor cultivate land that is several times larger and can produce another large batch of grain?
    I know that abroad, some people say that the new measures in agriculture mean a fundamental change in the entire economic policy of the Soviet Union. These statements are not true. We do not relax our attention to industrial development, we do not sacrifice industry for agriculture. The various sectors of industry will continue to develop according to the formulated plans, and in the future, the main attention will still be on heavy industry. The crawler tractors, plows, seed drills and other agricultural machines produced by industry this year and next year (1955) will mainly be sent to the newly reclaimed lands, so the number of tractors on the old lands will not increase this year and next year. Cultivating tractors, cultivators and other tillage tools, as well as parts for the original tractors, will be transported there. At the same time, the country's grain production will increase, and we will be able to distribute the produced agricultural machines more evenly again.

    关于苏联农业发展的几个问题
    赫鲁晓夫答英国贝尔纳教授问
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十三日电：九月二十五日，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫接见了英国科学家和公众领袖、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人约翰·贝尔纳教授。
    前几天，贝尔纳教授在伦敦“泰晤士报”上发表了他和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫的谈话的摘录。谈话记录全文如下：
    问：苏联的新的农业政策已在国外引起了各种各样的评论，这个政策往往被说成是新的农业危机和集体化制度的失败的反映。对农业的巨大注意，许多新的决议，甚至农业展览会本身都被当作是这种看法的证明。例如，在西伯利亚和哈萨克迅速进行的开垦新地的工作，就被认为是情况严重的证明。因此，我希望你，由于你在很大程度上是新方针的负责者，谈谈制订新政策时的主要政治考虑。
    答：我想你已经读过报纸上所刊载的关于苏联共产党中央委员会所举行的关于进一步发展苏联农业的全体会议的材料。这些决议在国外引起了许多评论。苏联的敌人正在企图利用我们对农业中的缺点的批评，来达到他们自己的目的，并且用他们自己的想法来解释这种批评。
    的确，我们尖锐地批评了我们农业中的缺点。但是，我们并不沉溺在由于某种病态的悔恨感而产生的自怨自艾之中。我们这样做，是因为严厉的批评将帮助我们所有的工作人员更清楚地了解和认识我们的弱点，更好地工作和更迅速地消灭缺点。
    苏联共产党在国家工业化所取得的成就的基础上，已经提出了在今后两、三年内保证日用消费品生产急剧增长的任务。不用说，要增加这些日用消费品的生产，就必须加速发展农业，特别是大大增加谷物生产。
    国外有很多人在谈论着：似乎约·维·斯大林在第十八次党代表大会上和格·马·马林科夫在第十九次党代表大会上所说的我国谷物问题已经解决的说法，和苏联共产党中央委员会最近几次全体会议所通过的指出增加谷物生产和在荒地上扩大谷物播种面积的必要性的决议之间，存在着矛盾。实际上，这里面并没有什么矛盾。约·维·斯大林和格·马·马林科夫当时说我们已经有足够的谷物来供应居民所需要的面包，这是完全正确的。我们国家满足了它在面包方面的需要。现在，我们也有足够的面包，而且还有必要的储备。但是，人不光是靠面包过活的。而正是人们的其他方面的需要，间接地要求增加谷物生产。
    苏联的发展，苏联经济的巩固和劳动人民的福利在这个基础上的增长，使得最近几年来对各种各样以前我们不能大量生产的货品的需要大大增加了。我们国家每年都减低物价，职工的实际工资不断增加，居民的购买力不断提高。显然，在这种情况下，对质量较差的货品的需要就会不断减少，相反，对质量高的货品的需要则大大增加。越来越多的人到商店里要买精致的物品了。当战争刚结束不久物价还高的时候，对居民的日用消费品供应似乎还勉强够。而既然在过去几年中物价已经大大减低，因此，就感到某些货品稍为缺少了一些，虽然实际上所有这些货品的产量已经有相当大的增加。广大居民群众都要求质量更好的货品。我们有任务来满足这个要求。
    在资本主义制度下，这样一种情况——对货品的需要增加，供不应求——就会提供谋取利润的大好机会。可是，我们国家的情形就不同。社会主义的道路就是发展生产，并且继续执行减低物价的政策。我们正应该从这样的角度来看谷物表面上缺少的现象。
    在这里，根本没有危机这回事。在我们国家内，形势比以前任何时候不是更坏，而是更好了。问题在于，在我们发展到更高的阶段时，对日用消费品的需要大大增加了。
    我们的党一贯坚持不渝地奉行着以各种方法增加日用消费品生产和最大限度地满足劳动人民不断增长的需要的政策。为了要提高商品生产的水平，就必须提高谷物生产的水平。因为，归根结蒂，谷物是其他一切食品的基础，谷物同时又是生产其他许多日用消费品的基础。为了要获得更多的谷物，已经决定利用哈萨克和西伯利亚的生荒地——宜于种植谷物的大片肥沃的平原。
    这些新的田地为我们出产价钱最便宜的谷物。正在开垦生荒地的这些地区，实际上是连绵不断的平原。如果说，那里耕种田地的人在早饭后开始耕田，在开始向后转的地方吃中饭，那么，返回来时正好是吃晚饭的时候，这并没有过分。那里生产谷物的成本是最低的，因此，在那些地区种植谷物对我们是有利的。
    这个任务将在两年内完成。我们原先计划开垦一千三百万公顷生荒地。这个计划正在胜利地履行：在一九五四年播种了三百五十万公顷以上的生荒地，已经开垦好的准备在明年播种的生荒地的总面积超过了一千七百万公顷。苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议已经修改了原来的计划，并且考虑到现有的潜力，决定在一九五六年，使种植谷物的生荒地面积增加到二千八百万到三千万公顷。只要那里每公顷土地至少有十公担的收获量，那么，这些土地就总共将出产约三亿公担或十八亿普特谷物。这是最低的数字，因为这些土地的单位面积产量常常为这个数字的三倍。
    在开垦了这些生荒地以后，我国将可以得到足够的谷物来满足居民的一切需要，并且保证畜牧业的发展，保证出口和建立必要的储备。我们可以给例如不能在它们自己的土地上生产足够的谷物的捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国，以及在歉收年中不能充分满足自己需要的罗马尼亚、匈牙利和保加利亚等友好国家以更大的援助。
    在增加了谷物生产以后，我们也可以利用更多的谷物作牲畜的饲料，这样就能够增加猪和其他牲畜的头数，并把牲畜养得更肥，这就是说把谷物变成肉类。乌克兰有句俗话说：“没有比猪肉腊肠更好吃的鸟儿了。”我们希望用增加谷物生产的办法来取得更多的这种“鸟儿”。
    开垦新地将帮助我们更迅速地增加牲畜饲料的生产量。我们将能调拨更多的土地来种植饲料作物。这样就有可能增加牛奶的产量，增加羊的只数和羊毛的产量。
    而且，生荒地上增产的谷物，将使我们能够把我国其他地区的种植谷物的土地的一部分调拨出来种植其他重要作物。
    我已经说过，我们现在除了面包以外还需要许多其他产品。我们可以采用在已经开垦了的地区扩大其他作物的播种面积的办法，来获得这些产品。
    以糖为例。我们需要更多的糖，而且我们将能够获得更多的糖，办法是：除了乌克兰的已经用来种植甜菜的土地以外，我们还要在乌克兰调拨出约三十万公顷土地来种植甜菜。关于棉花、蔬菜和需要更多的水分和管理的其他作物的情况也是这样。现在，将有可能利用多少减少人口比较稠密的地区的谷物播种面积的办法，来扩大工业原料作物的播种面积了。
    因此，我们的任务就是利用新的谷物来源来改善对居民的食品供应。
    当然你可以问：如果这些财富——就是说生荒地——一直摆在我们的家门口，为什么我们以前没有想到它们呢？人民老早——早在革命以前的古代——就想到它们了。甚至沙皇还打算利用这块肥沃的土地呢。但是，这是办不到的。在苏维埃政权成立以后的头几十年中，这也是办不到的，当时我们还没有充分发展的农业机器制造工业。在两年内开垦的土地的面积，将等于乌克兰现在的总播种面积，并将比它的谷物播种面积大百分之五十。要开垦这些土地需要几千万农民，但是，这样多的人是找不到的。
    只有在现在，当社会主义工业已经发展了，当苏联机器制造工业已达到了它目前的规模的时候，才有可能用比较少的人来开垦这样广大的土地。
  一九五四年，已经送去了十二万台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）、一万台联合机和其他许多机器去开垦生荒地。应该指出，拨出这些机器并不需要扩大农业机器生产计划。在作出关于这个计划的决议的时候，我们号召人们志愿参加开垦工作；大约需要几万人来开垦生荒地，但是，号召一发出不久，响应党的号召志愿参加开垦的人数就大大超过了我们所需要的人数。有了机器又有了人，就没有什么能够阻碍我们得到我们所需要的那样多的谷物了。
    我们也没有忘记我们的有了良好发展的地区。你参观过农业展览会，是么？这个展览会不是为了消遣而举办的。我们是用它来显示各地区最优秀的集体农庄的成就的。农民们到那里去参观，他们在那里研究并且开始认识到他们也能获得同样的成绩。我们的任务是，用一切办法来巩固作为社会主义农业的不变基础的集体农庄。我们要把普通的集体农庄提高到最先进的集体农庄的水平。这个展览会是一个真正的人民的大学。
    问：这个展览会的显著特点之一就是，它很重视农村电力站的发展。这些农村电力站是比较小的，而在我看来，是不经济的，因为它们所生产的电力比从现在你们正在建筑的大型电力站得到的电力要贵得多。既然如此，那么你们为什么还要这样做呢？
    答：你说的完全对，小型电力站的电力是比大电力站的电力要贵得多。但是，尽管如此，建立小型电力站对集体农庄来说，还是有利的。应该考虑到，在我们国家中，尽管在战后年代中进行了大规模的电力站建设，但是，电力仍感缺乏。大电力站所生产的电力差不多完全被工业使用了。显然，必须首先满足工业的电力需要。因此，直到现在，农业从大电力站得到的电力是很少的。
    集体农庄正在建筑小型电力站，因为，它们所发的电力总比从农业中使用的简单的发电机所得到的电力要便宜些。
    由于建设电力站，虽然是小型电力站，集体农庄就可以提高农业机械化和电气化的水平，就可以不仅利用电力来供应家庭需要，而且，特别可以依靠它来使用靠电力发动的农业机器。因此，建设发电能力小的电力站的作法是正确的，因为，这些电力站可以满足集体农庄的迫切需要。
    将来，随着国家的电气化事业的发展，大型电力站就将供给农业更多的电力，它们目前已经开始这样做了。
    问：你们对于开垦新地的重视，自然而然地引起了这样一个问题：这是不是意味着取消或者至少是缩减苏联东南部地区用来防旱的巨大的灌溉工程和其他工程。目前，对亚洲的开发似乎正在给予比对欧洲的开发更多的注意。这究竟正确到什么程度，这样做的原因是什么？
    答：这是一个提得十分合理的问题，但是回答很简单。我们规定不仅要发展国内的这一个或那一个地区，而且要发展整个苏联，这要依我们目前的需要和可能得到的资源而定。例如，我们要增加农产品的产量。通过更加精细地利用现有的播种面积，和通过开垦新地就能够做到这一点。
    我们正在尽力增加各个地区的农产品产量。为了要使产量大大增加，我们需要大量的肥料，因此就必须建筑许多新工厂。这一切都需要时间，而我们又不能等待。目前，就像我已经说过的，利用新地获得的经济利益最大。开垦这些新地是迅速增加谷物产量的最好的办法。但是，我们将不仅扩大播种面积，而且我们还将为进一步精耕细作而努力。
    这是不是意味着我们将取消或缩减灌溉工程呢？完全不是。灌溉工程将要进行，而且正在那些灌溉对于重要的作物（蔬菜、棉花和葡萄）的生产最为有利的地方进行。但是，到目前为止，我们不准备把重点放在这里。
    到目前为止，我们必须把我们的精力集中在我们能够得到最大的收获的地方。这仅仅是一个计算经济利益和潜力的问题。今天，我们把一台新的拖拉机送到哪里去最好呢？是把它送到旧有的土地上去，让它一天耕十公顷呢，还是把它送到新的土地上去，让这台拖拉机在面积大几倍、而且又能生产另外一大批谷物的土地上耕耘呢？
    我知道，在外国，有人说，农业方面的新措施意味着苏联整个经济政策有了根本的改变。这些说法是不符合事实的。我们并不放松对工业发展的注意，我们并不为了农业而牺牲工业。工业各部门将继续根据拟订的计划发展，在将来，主要的注意力还是放在重工业上。工业在今年和明年（一九五五年）生产的爬行拖拉机、犁、种子条播机和其他一些农业机器，主要将送到新开垦的土地上去，因此，在今年和明年，旧有的土地上的拖拉机的数量将不会有所增加。将把中耕用拖拉机、中耕机和其他耕地的工具以及原有的拖拉机的零件运到那里去。同时，国内的谷物生产量将增加，我们将能再度比较均衡地分配生产出来的农业机器。
