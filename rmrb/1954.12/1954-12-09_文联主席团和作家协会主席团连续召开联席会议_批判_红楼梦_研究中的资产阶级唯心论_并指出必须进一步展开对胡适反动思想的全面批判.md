    The Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association held eight extended joint meetings from October 31st to December 8th to discuss the tendency of Hu Shih's bourgeois idealism in the research of "Dream of the Red Chamber," the mistakes of "Wenyi Bao" (Literary Gazette) on the issue of "Dream of the Red Chamber" research, and reviewed the entire work of "Wenyi Bao." The meeting finally made a resolution on "Wenyi Bao," re-stipulated the future direction of "Wenyi Bao," reorganized the editorial organization, and put forward methods to improve the future work of the Chinese Writers Association and other literary and art organizations' publications.
    Those who spoke at these eight extended joint meetings included Feng Xuefeng, Yu Pingbo, Chen Xianghe, Zheng Zhenduo, Lao She, He Qifang, Jian Bozan, Yang Hui, Tan Pimo, You Guoen, Nie Gannu, Chen Qixia, Song Zhi's, Yu Heiding, Zang Kejia, Liu Baiyu, Hu Feng, Luo Binji, Lu Ling, Zhong Jingwen, Wu Zuguang, Kong Luosun, Huang Yaomian, Shi Tianping, Bai Ren, Kang Tuo, Yuan Shuipai, Wu Xue, Li Zhihua, Ding Ling, Zhou Yang, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun and more than thirty others. In their speeches, they pointed out that Yu Pingbo's "Research on Dream of the Red Chamber" and some of his articles on "Dream of the Red Chamber" published in recent years are erroneous works that propagate Hu Shih's bourgeois idealist viewpoints. These works distort and belittle the significance and value of our classical literary works and spread poison among the masses. The meeting pointed out that in order to criticize bourgeois idealism in the research of "Dream of the Red Chamber," it is necessary to further展开 a comprehensive critique of Hu Shih's reactionary ideology. At the same time, the meeting severely condemned the capitulationism towards bourgeois ideology.
    Guo Moruo put forward three important suggestions in his speech: First, resolutely launch an ideological struggle against bourgeois idealism; second, widely展开 free academic discussions and promote constructive criticism; and third, step up support for new forces. He put forward a sixteen-character goal for establishing constructive criticism, which is: distinguish right from wrong, distinguish between enemies and friends, be kind to others, and have substance in speech.
    The meeting's discussion was always conducted in an atmosphere of heated and free debate. All aspects of opinions were fully expressed at the meeting. The meeting also criticized some erroneous speeches. Important speeches will be published in "People's Daily" and other newspapers and periodicals in the capital. The meeting made a good start for展開ing ideological struggle in the literary and art circles in the future, and initially achieved the effect of protecting and promoting Marxist ideology and opposing bourgeois idealist ideology and bourgeois individualism in the literary and art field.

    文联主席团和作家协会主席团连续召开联席会议
    批判“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级唯心论
    并指出必须进一步展开对胡适反动思想的全面批判
    中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团从十月三十一日到十二月八日先后召开了八次扩大联席会议，就反对“红楼梦”研究中的胡适派资产阶级唯心论的倾向、“文艺报”在关于“红楼梦”研究问题上的错误等问题展开了热烈的讨论，并检查了“文艺报”的整个工作。会议最后作出了关于“文艺报”的决议，重新规定了“文艺报”今后的方针，改组了编辑机构，并提出了改进中国作家协会及其他各文艺团体机关刊物今后工作的办法。
    先后在这八次扩大联席会议上发言的，有冯雪峰、俞平伯、陈翔鹤、郑振铎、老舍、何其芳、翦伯赞、杨晦、谭丕谟、游国恩、聂绀弩、陈企霞、宋之的、于黑丁、臧克家、刘白羽、胡风、骆宾基、路翎、钟敬文、吴祖光、孔罗荪、黄药眠、师田平、白刃、康濯、袁水拍、吴雪、李之华、丁玲、周扬、郭沫若、茅盾等三十多人。他们在发言中指出：俞平伯所著“红楼梦研究”和他近年来所发表的一些关于“红楼梦”的文章，是宣传胡适派资产阶级唯心论观点的错误著作。这些著作歪曲了和贬低了我国古典文学作品的意义和价值，在群众中间散布了毒素。会议指出：批判“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级唯心论，必须进一步展开对胡适反动思想的全面批判。同时，会议严厉地谴责了对资产阶级思想的投降主义。
    郭沫若在发言中提出了三点重要建议：一、坚决地展开对于资产阶级唯心论的思想斗争；二、广泛地展开学术上的自由讨论，提倡建设性的批评；三、加紧扶植新生力量。他关于建立建设性的批评，提出了十六个字的目标，那就是：明辨是非，分清敌友，与人为善，言之有物。
    会议的讨论始终是在热烈的自由争论的空气中进行的。各方面的意见都在会上得到了充分的发挥。会议也对一些错误的发言进行了批评。重要发言都将在“人民日报”及首都其它报刊上发表。会议为今后文艺界展开思想斗争作了良好的开端，初步收到了在文艺领域保护和发扬马克思主义思想、反对资产阶级唯心论思想和资产阶级个人主义作风的效果。　　　　（新华社）
