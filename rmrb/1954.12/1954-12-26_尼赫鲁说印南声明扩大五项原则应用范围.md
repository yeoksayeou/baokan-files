Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 25th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a meeting of Indian National Congress workers in Birbhum County, near Santiniketan in Calcutta, on the 23rd that the joint statement he and Yugoslav President Tito issued in New Delhi "was a major step in expanding the scope of application of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

Prime Minister Nehru said that although the wording of this joint statement was not exactly the same as the joint statements of the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers and the Chinese and Burmese Prime Ministers, they affirmed that every country should recognize each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and one country should not commit any aggression against another.

    尼赫鲁说印南声明扩大五项原则应用范围
    【新华社新德里二十五日电】印度总理尼赫鲁二十三日在加尔各答附近的山提尼克坦举行的比尔浦姆县印度国大党工作人员会议上说，他和南斯拉夫总统铁托在新德里发表的联合声明，“是在扩大和平共处原则的应用范围方面走了一大步”。
    尼赫鲁总理说，虽然这个联合声明的措词和中印总理、中缅总理的联合声明不完全一样，但是他们确认，每一个国家都应该承认彼此的主权和领土完整，一国不应该向另一国进行任何侵略。
