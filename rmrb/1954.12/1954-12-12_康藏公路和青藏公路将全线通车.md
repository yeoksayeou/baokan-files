    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 11th: The Kangzang (Sichuan-Tibet) Highway and the Qinghai-Tibet Highway will soon be fully open to traffic.
    The vast construction teams working on the eastern and western sections of the Kangzang Highway met on November 27th on the river滩 (tān, a flat area of sand or mud near a river) west of the Ba River Bridge. That same evening, trucks carrying bridge-building materials drove to the southern bank of the Lhasa River in the outskirts of Lhasa to support the construction of the Lhasa River Bridge. On December 2nd, workers drove the first pile into the ancient Lhasa River, and the Lhasa River Bridge project began. Now, the automatic pile driver is continuously hammering the piles, and the foundation work of the bridge has progressed from the river滩 to the water surface. Every day, trucks carrying materials constantly drive from the east to the bridge construction site. At night, workers continue to work under the electric lights.
    After the Qinghai-Tibet Highway opened to traffic to Heihe (Nagqu) on November 16th, it rapidly advanced towards Lhasa. In half a month, it extended more than 260 kilometers. Now, the construction team has crossed the Yangbajing Grassland and is only dozens of kilometers away from Lhasa.
    In Lhasa, people from all walks of life are actively preparing to welcome the opening of the two highways with joy. The parking lot in front of the Potala Palace and the suburban road connecting the parking lot to the Qinghai-Tibet Highway via the Lhasa River Bridge are under intense construction. Citizens are tidying up the streets, young men and women and students are rehearsing Tibetan folk dances, and the cultural troupe of the Tibet Military Region is also rushing to rehearse literary and artistic programs to be performed at the opening ceremony.

    康藏公路和青藏公路将全线通车
    【新华社拉萨十一日电】康藏公路和青藏公路在最近将要全线通车。
    康藏公路东、西两段浩大的筑路队伍自十一月二十七日在巴河桥西的河滩上会合以后，当天晚上，载着架桥用料的汽车，就开到拉萨市郊的拉萨河南岸，支援拉萨河大桥的修筑工程。十二月二日，工人们在古老的拉萨河上打下了第一根桥桩，拉萨河大桥工程动工了。现在，自动打桩机不停地锤击着桥桩，大桥的基础工程已由河滩推进到水面。每天，运料卡车不断地从东向大桥工地开来。夜晚，在电灯光下，工人们仍不停地施工。
    青藏公路自十一月十六日通车黑河后，迅速向拉萨疾进，半个月内，又前伸了二百六十多公里。现在，筑路队伍已越过羊八井草原，距离拉萨只有几十公里了。
    在拉萨，各阶层人民以欢欣的心情积极筹备迎接两条公路的通车。布达拉宫前的停车场，和从拉萨河大桥经停车场同青藏公路联接的市郊公路正在紧张施工。市民们正整理着街道，男女青年们、学生们正排练着西藏的民族歌舞，西藏军区文艺工作团也在赶排通车时上演的文艺节目。
