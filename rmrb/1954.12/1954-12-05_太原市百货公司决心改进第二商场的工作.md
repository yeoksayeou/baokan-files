    Taiyuan Department Store Resolves to Improve Work at its Second Store
    A letter from Hu Zongzhou, Second Manager of the Taiyuan Department Store, et al.: The letter "Problems Facing the Leaders of the Taiyuan Department Store," published in the "Readers' Letters" column on November 14th, accurately reflects the problems currently existing in our work. After our company's Second Store opened in January of this year, the organization expanded rapidly, and the number of personnel continued to increase. Because political work was not strengthened in a timely manner, coupled with some chaotic phenomena in management and operation, some salespersons had poor service attitudes, verbally abused customers, and committed embezzlement and theft. Although we discovered this situation, because the education work was not done well enough, and individual bad elements were not dealt with in a timely manner, the problems were not completely resolved. We are now determined to redouble our efforts in order to change this situation.
    Our business hours should indeed not be changed arbitrarily. Even if there are special circumstances requiring a change in business hours, it must be submitted to the higher authorities for approval and announced at the door in advance, so as not to waste the precious time of the masses and affect the relationship between the government and the people.

    太原市百货公司决心改进第二商场的工作
    太原市百货公司第二经理胡宗周等来信：十一月十四日“读者来信专页”发表的“摆在太原百货商店领导面前的问题”的来信，确实反映了目前我们工作中存在的问题。我公司第二商场在今年一月开始营业后，机构迅速扩大，人员不断增加。由于政治工作没有及时加强，再加上经营管理方面存在着一些混乱现象，就发生了少数营业员服务态度不好，谩骂顾客和贪污偷盗等现象。我们虽然发现了这种情况，但是因为教育工作做得不够，对个别坏分子也没有及时处理，以至问题没有彻底解决。我们今后决心加倍努力，以期改变这种情况。
    我们的营业时间，确实不应该随意变动，即使有特殊情况，需要变更营业时间，亦须呈请上级批准，并提早在门口公布，以免耗费广大群众的宝贵时间，影响了政府与人民的关系。
