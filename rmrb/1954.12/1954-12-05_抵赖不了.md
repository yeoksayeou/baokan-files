Cannot Deny It

Denial and Playing the Rogue

After the Supreme People's Court of our country announced the sentences of American spies Donaldine and others, the American officials tried their best to claim that these American spies were "innocent" and bit back, making a so-called "strong protest" to our country. The reactionary American congressmen and reactionary newspapers took the opportunity to stir up a hysterical opposition to the People's Republic of China.

For example, the notorious Chiang Kai-shek's mouthpiece, American Senator Knowland, clamored for "strict naval blockade" of the coast of the People's Republic of China and "sinking a few of their (referring to the People's Republic of China) ships." Another American Congressman, Lane, even shouted to use "force" and intensify assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to "counterattack the Chinese mainland," and put forward an "ultimatum" demanding that the People's Republic of China "send these people to the United States by plane within a week."...

People cannot help but ask: How could the announcement of two spy cases make these gentlemen beat their chests and stamp their feet as if mourning their parents?

The reason is simple. A painstakingly managed subversive plan has failed, which is naturally sad for the bosses of the American aggression group. When a thief is caught with one hand, he always tries to deny it first, and then plays a rogue.

Trying to Cover Up, Full of Contradictions

In trying to deny it, the American ruling group is indeed in a ridiculous situation of self-contradiction regarding the case of Donaldine and others.

This can be evidenced by the official statements of the American officials and the military. The U.S. Department of Defense's November 23 statement said that American spies Donaldine and Fecteau were "approved passengers on a plane under military contract with the Far East Air Force" and were "on a routine flight from Seoul to Japan." But two days later, a spokesman for the U.S. Far East Air Force said that "the two men stowed away on a civil aviation transport company plane," "mysteriously disappeared," and "for some unexplained reason," did not reveal that there were these two people on the plane when the plane disappeared. But two days later, United Press International quoted "reliable sources" as saying that Donaldine and Fecteau "may have been kidnapped from South Korea by the Communists." Everyone can see that three contradictory statements appeared in five days.

Even more strange is that the statements issued by the U.S. Department of Defense and the State Department both insisted that "Mr. Donaldine and Mr. Fecteau were civilians employed by the Department of the Army," but the U.S. Far East Command slapped the U.S. Department of Defense and the State Department in the face, saying that "no files could be found regarding their situation, and nothing could be found to indicate that they may have been civilian employees of the Army or Air Force..." (United Press International). These evasive and contradictory statements have already exposed them as spies with special secret missions. Therefore, in the face of the facts, a United Press International dispatch on November 27 has already deviously admitted that the plane Donaldine and others were on had a "possibility" of "indeed flying to China to carry out a mission." And the U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" on November 24 more specifically confessed that "the family of a Massachusetts man who was captured (note: of the thirteen American spies recently sentenced, only Fecteau is from Massachusetts) said: it is understood that he is related to espionage work."

It can be seen that the spy case of Donaldine and others can absolutely not be erased by the chaotic statements of the American officials; however, the facts reflected in the case of Donaldine and others, that the U.S. government is carrying out large-scale subversive activities and blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, are even more ironclad evidence that cannot be denied.

Blatant Subversive Plans

The U.S. government's activities to subvert other countries are primarily targeted at the countries of the peaceful democratic camp. As everyone knows, on October 10, 1951, the U.S. Congress passed the so-called "Mutual Security Act" and the Costantino Amendment, legislating to allocate 100 million U.S. dollars annually to carry out espionage and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries. The blatant interference in the internal affairs of other countries by this bill can be seen from the blatant remarks of Costantino, the drafter of this amendment, who said: "My amendment stipulates the possibility of providing assistance to possible underground organizations in these countries (note: referring to the countries of the peaceful democratic camp), or those that will appear in these countries... This assistance is aimed directly at achieving the overthrow of the current legitimate governments of the above countries." This clearly exposes the U.S. government's sinister intentions.

Not only that, but on the basis of this legislation, the U.S. Congress has successively passed laws expanding subversive activities against peaceful democratic countries. On June 20, 1952, the U.S. Congress passed a law providing supplementary appropriations for sabotage activities in other countries. This law allows the government to use "any supplementary funds" allocated to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the U.S. budget for this purpose. On May 5, 1953, the Eisenhower administration submitted a bill to Congress for review, which stipulated that supplementary funds should be allocated to serve as funds for carrying out sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. In June of the same year, Costantino, the drafter of the above-mentioned "Mutual Security Act" and its amendment, again submitted a series of bills to Congress, "stipulating that private and government agencies should provide such assistance in order to promote the realization of 'rebellion plans' in China, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania" (United States International News Service). Costantino also clamored to "organize" "very good large rebellion plans" in the peaceful democratic countries, so that "more air forces cannot take off," the "many armies" of the peaceful democratic countries "cannot move," and do their best to provoke "the unease and tension of 800 million people" in the peaceful democratic countries.

Look, such blatant interference in the internal affairs of other countries, such systematic instigation of international provocations, and the gathering of social scum and sending them to democratic countries to carry out sabotage activities, such raising the subversive activities against the legitimate governments of sovereign countries to the level of government policy, has truly never happened in the history of international relations.

Never Stopped Sabotage Activities Against China

This can also be evidenced by the speech made by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on November 29. In this speech, Dulles not only declared with ulterior motives that the "political systems" of the peaceful democratic camp countries were "not unchangeable," but also proposed to use "external support" to promote the so-called "liberation" of the peaceful democratic camp countries, and also admitted that "regarding this, we are doing it in many ways." Facts show that the important aspect of the subversive activities that Dulles admitted to "doing in many ways" is clearly aimed at the People's Republic of China.

As everyone knows, after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the United States has never stopped espionage and sabotage activities against our country. And as the People's Republic of China becomes increasingly powerful and consolidated, sending spies and secret agents to our country to carry out subversive activities has increasingly become an important means for the U.S. war-mongering group to oppose our country. The many American spy cases cracked in our country in the past five years, as well as the recently announced case of Donaldine and others, are ironclad evidence of this subversive activity by the United States. In fact, this has long been an open secret. Haven't various American officials and political figures long openly clamored and admitted to sending spies to our country to carry out subversive activities? The "investigation report" of the U.S. Congressional Zhou Yide team published in March this year proposed that "methods must be found to weaken and destroy Communist China" and subvert our country from "within." On January 25 this year, American aggressor Wedemeyer believed that due to the consolidation of the People's Republic of China, "an immediate attack on the mainland is not timely," therefore, this "can first be started by sending secret agents into the country (note: referring to the People's Republic of China)..." And in fact, many American newspapers have long admitted that the United States has consistently carried out espionage and sabotage activities against our country.

The U.S. "Newsweek" on February 2 last year frankly said: "Although this may be denied, the Eisenhower administration does intend to greatly rely on subversive activities and sabotage activities when stepping up the Cold War against the Soviet Union. Although few people know it, the fact is that the United States has already been carrying out such activities on a large scale against the Communists on the Chinese mainland. The reason why this situation has been kept secret in the past is that Washington officials are afraid that if the fact that the United States has already taken this 'dirty' approach is revealed, the American public may be shocked."

In this way, anyone can see clearly that since sending spies and secret agents to peaceful democratic countries (including the People's Republic of China) to carry out subversive activities is the established policy of the United States, and in fact it is also being stepped up day by day, and at the same time it has been proven by the consecutive cracking of human and material evidence by the countries of the peaceful democratic camp, and it has also been publicly admitted by American officials, political figures, and various newspapers, now the American officials want to deny one of the practices of this American policy - the case of Donaldine and others, isn't this a great joke?

For the Safety of the Country and the Interests of Peace,
Resolutely Smash the Subversive Activities of the United States

Facts are the most eloquent. In the face of the facts, the American propagandists' slanders against our country's peaceful diplomatic policy by using the case of American spies Donaldine and others, the so-called argument that our country's sentencing of American spies Donaldine and others seems to contradict the principle of peaceful coexistence announced by our country, can no longer deceive people. Since the U.S. government has consistently allocated funds to support and organize spies to enter our country to conspire to subvert the only legitimate government of our country in accordance with the "Mutual Security Act," it is the inherent responsibility and legitimate means of a sovereign country to protect itself by punishing these spies sent in by our people in accordance with the law.

The Chinese people are willing to coexist peacefully with any other country. However, only when it is built on the basis of non-interference in internal affairs and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty is it true peaceful coexistence. It is also for this reason that resolutely exposing and punishing spies like Donaldine and others, and smashing the subversive activities of the United States, is conducive to the interests of world peace and the safety of all countries. Tell those shameless American aggressors that denial and playing the rogue are of no avail!

    抵赖不了
    胡思升
    抵赖和耍无赖
    我国最高人民法院判处美国间谍唐奈等人的案件发表后，美国官方竭力把这些美国间谍和自己说成是“无罪的”，并反咬一口，向我国提出所谓“强硬的抗议”；反动的美国议员和反动报刊，则乘机掀起反对中华人民共和国的歇斯底里。
    例如，那臭名远扬的蒋贼代言人美国参议员诺兰就叫嚷要对中华人民共和国海岸“实行严密的海军封锁”，并“击沉他们（按：指中华人民共和国）几艘船只”，另一个美国众议员蓝恩更叫嚣使用
  “武力”和加紧援助蒋介石卖国集团“对中国大陆进行反攻”，并提出“最后通牒”，要中华人民共和国在“一个星期时间内用飞机把这些人送到美国”。……
    人们不免要问了：怎么为了两个间谍案子的公布，就惹得这些先生们那样捶胸顿足、如丧考妣一般了呢？
    原因很简单。一个苦心经营的颠覆计划破了产，自然是美国侵略集团的那些老板们所伤心的；当盗贼被捉住了一只手的时候，他总是先图抵赖，而后再耍一番无赖的。
  欲盖弥彰，矛盾百出
    在企图抵赖的时候，美国统治集团围绕着唐奈等的案子，真是陷于自相矛盾的可笑的境地了。
    这可以拿美国官方和军方的正式声明为证。美国国防部十一月二十三日的声明说美国间谍唐奈和费克图是“在一架与远东空军订有军事合同的飞机上的被核准的乘客”，“正在作汉城到日本的例行飞行”。但过了两天，美国远东空军发言人却说这“两人偷乘了一架民用航空运输公司的飞机”“神秘地失踪了”，并且“为了某些仍未说明的原因”，在飞机失踪时没有透露在飞机上有这两个人。但又过了两天，合众社又引“可靠人士”的话说，唐奈和费克图两人“可能是被共产党人从南朝鲜绑架去的”。大家看，五天内竟出现了三种互相矛盾的说法。
    更奇怪的是，美国国防部和国务院发表的声明都一口咬定“唐奈先生和费克图先生是陆军部雇用的文职人员”，但是美国远东司令部又打了美国国防部和国务院一记响亮的耳光，说“无法找到有关他们情况的卷宗，找不到东西来表明他们可能曾是陆军或空军的文职雇员……”（合众社）。这些躲躲闪闪的矛盾说法，就已经暴露出他们是负有特殊秘密使命的间谍分子。因此在事实面前，合众社十一月二十七日的电讯就已经转弯抹角地承认唐奈等人乘的飞机有“的确是飞往中国执行任务的”“可能性”。而十一月二十四日的美国“基督教科学箴言报”就更具体招认“被俘的一个马萨诸塞州人
  （按：最近被判刑的十三名美国间谍犯中，只有费克图一人是马萨诸塞州人）的家属说：据了解，他与谍报工作是有关系的。”
    由此可见，唐奈等人的间谍案件绝对不是美国官方的混乱声明所能抹煞的；但是，从唐奈等人的案件中反映出来的美国政府所进行的大规模的颠覆活动，露骨地干涉其他国家内政的事实，就更是铁证如山，万万抵赖不了的了。
  明目张胆的颠覆计划
    美国政府颠覆其他国家的活动，首先是针对和平民主阵营的国家的。大家知道，一九五一年十月十日，美国国会通过了所谓“共同安全法”及柯斯坦的修正案，以立法的形式规定每年拨款一亿美元对苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家进行间谍破坏活动。这个法案的对于别国内政的明目张胆的干涉，可以从这个修正案的起草人柯斯坦的露骨谈话中看出来，他说：“我的修正案规定了给予这些国家（按：指和平民主阵营各国）可能有的，或在这些国家中将要出现的地下组织以援助的可能……这些援助，是以实现推翻上述国家的现今的合法政府为其直接目的的”。这就清楚地把美国政府的罪恶用心完全端出来了。
    不仅如此，在这个立法的基础上，美国国会接连通过了扩大对和平民主国家进行颠覆活动的法律。一九五二年六月二十日，美国国会通过了在其他国家中进行破坏活动的补充拨款的法律。这个法律允许政府为了这个目的，可以动用美国预算中拨给北大西洋同盟的“任何补充款项”。一九五三年五月五日，艾森豪威尔政府提交国会审查一项法案，这项法案规定拨出补充款项，以充当进行反对苏联和人民民主国家的破坏活动的经费。同年六月，上述“共同安全法”及其修正案的起草人柯斯坦又向国会提出一系列的议案，“规定私人和政府机关来进行这样的援助，以便促进‘叛变计划’在中国、波兰、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的实现”（美国国际新闻社）。柯斯坦并大肆叫嚷在和平民主国家“组织”“很好的大反叛计划”，以便使“更多的空军不能起飞”，使和平民主国家的“许多军队不能动弹”，并尽力挑起和平民主国家“八亿人口的不安和紧张”。
    你看，这样露骨地干涉其他国家的内政，这样有系统地发动国际挑衅、并搜罗社会渣滓、把他们派到民主国家进行破坏活动，这样把对主权国家的合法政府进行的颠覆活动提高到政府政策的水平，在国际关系史上真是从来没有过的。
  从未停止过对中国的破坏活动
    这也可从美国国务卿杜勒斯十一月二十九日发表的演说中得到新的证据。在这篇演说中，杜勒斯不仅别有用心地宣称和平民主阵营各国的“政体”“不是不可改变的”，并且提出要用“外界的支持”来促进和平民主阵营各国的所谓“解放”，同时也承认“关于这一点，我们正在多方面地在做”。事实表明，杜勒斯承认“多方面在做”颠覆活动的重要一方面，显然是针对中华人民共和国的。
    大家知道，中华人民共和国建立后，美国从来没有停止过对我国的间谍破坏活动。而随着中华人民共和国的日益强大和巩固，派遣间谍特务到我国来进行颠覆活动，就越来越成为美国好战集团反对我国的重要手段了。五年来在我国破获的许多美国间谍案，以及最近发表的唐奈等人的案件，就是美国这种颠覆活动的铁的证据。实际上，这早已是公开的秘密了。美国的各种官方人物和政治人物不是早就公开叫嚷和承认派遣间谍到我国进行颠覆活动吗？今年三月发表的美国国会周以德小组的“调查报告”就提出“必须找出削弱和摧毁共产党中国的方法”，从“内部”来颠覆我国。今年一月二十五日，美国侵略分子魏德迈就认为由于中华人民共和国的巩固，“立即进攻大陆是不适时的”，因此，这“首先可以由派遣特务人员进入该国（按：指中华人民共和国）着手……”。而且事实上，美国的许多报刊早就明白承认美国一贯对我国进行间谍破坏活动。
    去年二月二日的美国“新闻周刊”就坦白地说：“尽管这件事可能遭到否认，但是艾森豪威尔政府的确打算在加紧对苏冷战的时候，大大地倚重颠覆活动和破坏活动。虽然很少人知道，事实是美国早已大事对中国大陆上的共产党进行着这种活动。过去这种情况之所以秘而不宣，原因之一就是，华盛顿官方害怕，如果把美国已经采取这种‘肮脏’做法的事实予以透露，那么美国公众可能将因此感到震惊。”
    这样，任何人都看得很清楚，派遣间谍特务到和平民主国家（包括中华人民共和国在内）来进行颠覆活动既然是美国的既定政策，而且事实上也在日益加紧进行，同时被和平民主阵营各国接连破获的人证物证所证明，也为美国的官方人物、政治人物和各种报刊所公开承认，现在美国官方却要来否认美国这种政策实践中的一件——唐奈等人的案件，这不是滑天下之大稽吗？
  为了国家的安全和和平的利益，
    坚决粉碎美国的颠覆活动
    事实是最雄辩的。在事实面前，美国宣传家借美国间谍唐奈等人的案件对我国和平外交政策进行的诬蔑，所谓我国判处美国间谍唐奈等人和我国宣布的和平共处原则似乎相矛盾的论调就更骗不了人了。既然美国政府根据“共同安全法”一贯拨款资助和组织间谍分子进入我国，阴谋颠覆我国的唯一合法政府，我国人民把这些派进来的间谍分子依法惩办，就是主权国家保卫自己的应尽职责和合法手段了。
    中国人民愿意和任何别的国家和平共处。但是，只有建筑在互不干涉内政和互相尊重领土主权的基础上，才是真正的和平共处。也正是为了这个原因，坚决揭露和惩处像唐奈等的间谍分子，粉碎美国的颠覆活动，才是有利于世界和平和各国安全的利益的。告诉那些恬不知耻的美国侵略者们，抵赖和耍无赖，都是无济于事的！
