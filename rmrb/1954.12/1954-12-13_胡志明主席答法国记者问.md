(Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 12th) Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi, December 12th: Chairman Ho Chi Minh answered questions posed to him on November 18th by Jean-Marie Le Pen, special correspondent for the French magazine "L'Observateur Illustré." The questions and answers are as follows:

	Question 1: Mr. Chairman, what are your views on the implementation of the armistice agreement clauses by both sides?

	Answer: We strictly abide by the clauses of the armistice agreement. We regret that the French forces have not correctly implemented these clauses, and are far from doing so! You probably already know these facts.

	Question 2: What general policy does the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam intend to pursue on its territory?

	Answer: We are devoting all our energy to consolidating peace, achieving national reunification, and realizing independence and democracy throughout Vietnam.

	Question 3: What are the main tasks that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has set for itself?

	Answer: We must restore our nation's war-damaged economy and improve the lives of our compatriots, especially the working people in urban and rural areas.

	Question 4: What methods does the government intend to use to accomplish these tasks?

	Answer: Through our own efforts and the fraternal assistance of friendly countries.

	Question 5: Mr. Chairman, what are your views on the situation in South Vietnam?

	Answer: I believe that the current situation in South Vietnam is serious due to the increasingly blatant interference of American interventionists. There is no doubt that our compatriots in the South will rise up against this interference.

	Question 6: Mr. Chairman, what are your views on the issue of Catholic refugees?

	Answer: This is part of the policy of American interventionists to sow discord among our people. I am very saddened to hear about the various hardships suffered by our compatriots who have been forcibly relocated to the South.

	Question 7: What is the nature of the relationship that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is willing to establish with France?

	Answer: We are willing to establish economic and cultural relations with France on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and faithful and trusting cooperation.

	Question 8: What are the relations with other countries, the countries of the democratic camp and other countries?

	Answer: With the countries of the democratic camp, we naturally have fraternal relations. We are also willing to establish friendly relations with all other countries, especially Asian countries.

	I would like to take this opportunity, through you, to extend fraternal greetings to the great French people who have fought valiantly for the cessation of the Indochina War and the restoration of peace.

    答：我们贡献我们的全部精力来巩固和平、实现国家统一和在越南全境实现独立和民主。
    问题三：越南民主共和国政府为自己规定的主要任务是什么？
    答：我们必须恢复我们国家的为战争破坏的经济，改善我们同胞的生活，首先是城乡劳动人民的生活。

    答：靠我们自己的努力和友好国家的兄弟般的帮助。
    问题五：主席先生，您对南越的局势有什么看法？

    问题六：主席先生，您对天主教难民问题有什么看法？
    答：这是美国干涉者力图在我们人民中间散播不和的政策的一部分。我听到被强迫迁往南部的我们的同胞所受的各种苦难，心里非常难过。

    答：我们愿意和法国在平等、互利以及忠实的和信任的合作的基础上建立经济和文化关系。

    答：同民主阵营的国家，我们自然有兄弟般的关系。我们也愿意同一切其他国家、首先是亚洲国家，建立友好关系。
    我愿利用这个机会，通过你向为了争取印度支那战争的停止和和平的恢复而英勇斗争过的伟大的法国人民致兄弟般的敬意。
