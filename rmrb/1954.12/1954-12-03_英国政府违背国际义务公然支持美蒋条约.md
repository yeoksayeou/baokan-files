    British Government Publicly Supports US-Chiang Treaty in Violation of International Obligations
    [Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch] London News: On December 1, a British Foreign Office spokesperson stated regarding the so-called "Mutual Security Treaty" soon to be signed between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, that negotiations "regarding this treaty have been underway for a long time." The British government "has been kept informed of the general situation and has maintained regular contact with the United States government regarding the general situation in the Far East." This proves that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's conclusion of a military alliance has the approval of the British government. The British government has recognized the People's Republic of China, but has actually agreed to the United States occupying China's territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands by concluding a bilateral treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This is an extremely unfriendly act towards the Chinese people. Moreover, Britain is a signatory to the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," which stipulate the return of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to China. Now, the British government actually agrees to the United States' act of aggression in severing China's territory of Taiwan. This is clearly a violation of the international obligations undertaken by Britain.

    英国政府违背国际义务公然支持美蒋条约
    【新华社二日讯】伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人十二月一日就美国和蒋介石卖国集团即将签订所谓“共同安全条约”一事声称，美蒋之间“关于这项条约的谈判已经进行很久了”。英国政府“一直获悉一般的情况，并且就远东一般局势同美国政府经常保持接触。”这就证明美国和蒋介石卖国集团缔结军事同盟是得到英国政府的同意的。英国政府已经承认了中华人民共和国，却竟然同意美国用和蒋介石卖国集团缔结双边条约的办法侵占中国的领土台湾和澎湖列岛，这是对中国人民极不友好的行为。而且英国是规定台湾和澎湖列岛归还中国的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”的参加国，现在英国政府竟然同意美国割裂中国领土台湾的侵略行为，这显然是违背了英国所承担的国际义务。
