    A Serious Problem Violating Price Policies
    Shang Wen
    Currently, the retail prices of some industrial products in many county-level state-owned commercial companies are lower than those in the place of production or large and medium-sized cities; the retail prices of industrial products in many rural grassroots cooperatives are generally lower than the retail prices of state-owned commercial companies in the county towns. This is a very abnormal phenomenon.
    The retail price of a "Red Cloud" brand towel from the Zhengzhou State-owned Commercial Company is 8,800 yuan per towel. After being transported 360 li (approximately 180km) to Nanyang City, it is sold for only 8,700 yuan per towel. The Gongdian Grassroots Cooperative, 18 li from Ye County, has about 90% of its department store goods priced lower than the retail prices of the Ye County State-owned Commercial Company, with the vast majority of goods priced more than 6% lower than the state-owned commercial company's retail prices. The Baidaokou Grassroots Cooperative, 55 li from Daokou Town (Hua County), has about 60% of its goods priced 3% to 9% lower than the Daokou Town State-owned Commercial Company's retail prices, and 26% of its goods priced slightly lower or the same as the state-owned commercial company's retail prices. In Xiting Township Cooperative, Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, each bar of "Guben" soap sells for 3,700 yuan, and each bar of "Lux" soap sells for 4,000 yuan, both 100 yuan lower than in Shanghai (the place of production). Each pair of "Double Coin" high-top boots sells for 39,400 yuan, which is 1,100 yuan lower than in Nantong City and 300 yuan lower than in Shanghai. In Qianwu Township Cooperative, Linhai County, Zhejiang Province (12 li from the county town), each bamboo-shell thermos sells for 16,800 yuan, which is 200 yuan lower than the retail price in the county department store. In Huangtan Township (80 li from the county town), Shaoxing County, the retail price of No. 2 kerosene is 6,960 yuan per liter, which is 740 yuan lower than the retail price in the state-owned store in the county town.
    This phenomenon is not isolated today but is widespread. It completely violates the state's price policy, goes against the normal circulation of goods, and is not conducive to urban-rural material exchange.
    Everyone knows that commodities must incur certain costs when transported from the place of production to the consumers in the place of sale, and commercial turnover should also have a certain profit. If the price of industrial products in rural areas is lower than that in the place of production and large and medium-sized cities, operating such products will not generate the due profit and will even result in losses. This will cause certain industrial products in large cities to be unsalable and pile up; consumers in the place of sale may not be able to buy the goods they need. This situation does not conform to the basic task of commerce serving industrial and agricultural production and serving the needs of the people, and thus does not conform to the long-term interests of the people.
    This phenomenon also reduces the profit accumulation of state-owned commerce and the profit accumulation of cooperative commerce. According to statistics from eight grassroots cooperatives in Nanyang, Hua County, and other places, the average profit rate from the first to the third quarter of 1954 was only 1.69%, and some supply and marketing cooperatives even lost 0.61%. The current profit rate is even lower than the preferential rate granted by the state (the state gives cooperatives a 3% preferential rate for department store goods).
    This phenomenon makes it particularly difficult for private retailers to maintain their businesses, which increases the difficulty for state-owned commerce to arrange the market comprehensively and is not conducive to the state's socialist transformation of private merchants.
    Why is this unreasonable phenomenon occurring?
    First, the difference between the wholesale and retail prices of industrial products in small-city state-owned commercial companies is smaller than that in large and medium-sized cities, and the regional price difference between wholesale prices in the two places is also small, so the retail prices in small cities are lower. For example, the wholesale-retail price difference for绒裤 (rongku, probably thick cloth pants) in Zhengzhou is 16.5%, while in Deng County it is 13%, which is 3.5% less than in Zhengzhou. For towels, the wholesale-retail price difference in Zhengzhou is 16.3%, while in Nanyang City it is 13.7%, which is 2.6% less than in Zhengzhou.
    Second, the retail prices of rural supply and marketing cooperatives are too low. The preferential prices for cooperative members are lower than the retail prices of state-owned companies, and the magnitude exceeds the preferential rate granted to cooperatives by the state.
    Third, state-owned commercial grassroots units and grassroots cooperatives lack full-time cadres to manage price work, and they do not have sufficient understanding of the seriousness and importance of price policies, which has led to the above phenomenon.
    The phenomenon of urban-rural price inversion of industrial products should be reversed, because the source of funds for our country's industrialization basically relies on domestic accumulation, the most important of which is the profits turned over by socialist enterprises. If the price of industrial products in rural areas is lower than that in cities, the country's construction funds will be invisibly lost, which is inconsistent with the general task of the transition period and the long-term interests of the peasants.
    Under normal circulation conditions, the price of industrial products in the place of sale should be higher than that in the place of production, and the price in rural areas should be higher than that in cities. Gradually reversing the urban-rural price inversion of industrial products, and concentrating the extra economic benefits previously obtained by rural consumers into national investment in industrial construction, is beneficial to the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country and also to the interests of the peasants.

    一个违反价格政策的严重问题
    商文
    目前，有许多县城国营商业公司部分工业品的零售价格，低于产地或大、中城市；许多乡村基层合作社工业品的零售价格又普遍低于县城国营商业公司的零售牌价。这是一种很不正常的现象。
    郑州市国营商业公司的红云牌毛巾，零售牌价八千八百元一条，运送到三百六十里外的南阳市后，每条反而只卖八千七百元；距离叶县十八里的龚店基层合作社，约有百分之九十的百货商品低于叶县国营商业公司的零售牌价，其中绝大多数商品低于国营商业公司零售牌价百分之六以上；距离道口镇
  （滑县）五十五里的白道口基层合作社，约有百分之六十的商品低于道口镇国营商业公司零售牌价百分之三至九，有百分之二十六的商品较国营商业公司零售牌价稍低或相平。江苏省南通县西亭乡合作社固本肥皂每条零售价三千七百元；力士香皂每块四千元，都低于上海（产地）一百元，双钱大平靴零售价三万九千四百元一双，低于南通市一千一百元，低于上海三百元。浙江省临海县前吴乡合作社（距县城十二里）竹壳热水瓶零售价一万六千八百元一个，低于县百货商店零售牌价二百元；绍兴县黄坛乡（距县城八十里）合作社二号煤油每公升零售价六千九百六十元，低于县城国营商店零售牌价七百四十元。
    这种现象在今天并不是个别的，而是普遍存在的。它完全不符合于国家的价格政策，违背了商品正常流转规律，也不利于城乡物资交流。
    谁都知道：商品从产地输送到销地的消费者手中，必须花费一定的费用，商业周转也应有一定的利润。如果工业品价格在乡村低于产地和大、中城市，经营这种产品就得不到应得的利润，而且要赔本，这就将使大城市某些工业品无人贩运而形成积压；销地消费者就可能买不到需要的商品。这种情况是不符合商业为工农业生产服务，为满足人民的需要服务的基本任务的，也就是不符合人民的长远利益的。
    这种现象，也缩小了国营商业的利润积累和合作社商业的利润积累。据南阳、滑县等地八个基层社的资料统计：一九五四年第一至三季度平均利润率只为百分之一点六九，个别供销合作社还赔百分之零点六一，目前的利润率尚不及国家给予的优待率（百货商品国家优待合作社百分之三）。
    这种现象，特别使私营零售商难以维持他们的营业，结果增加了国营商业全面安排市场的困难，也不利于国家对私商进行社会主义改造。
    为什么造成这种不合理的现象呢？
    第一、是因为小城市国营商业公司工业品的批零差价比大、中城市小，而两地批发牌价之间的地区差价也小，这样，小城市的零售牌价便低了。如绒裤，郑州市批零差价是百分之十六点五，邓县为百分之十三，小于郑州百分之三点五；毛巾类，郑州市批零差价是百分之十六点三，南阳市百分之十三点七，小于郑州百分之二点六。
    第二、是因为农村供销合作社的零售价格太低。合作社对社员的优待价格，比国营公司的零售牌价低，其幅度超过了国家给予合作社的优待率。
    第三、国营商业基层单位和基层合作社缺乏专职管理物价工作的干部，对价格政策的严肃性和重要性认识不足，因而形成以上现象。
    工业品的城乡倒差现象是应该扭转的，因为我们国家工业化的资金来源，基本上是依靠国内积累，其中最主要的是社会主义性质企业的上缴利润。农村工业品价格低于城市，就是无形中把国家的建设资金消失掉，这是和过渡时期的总任务及农民的长远利益不相符合的。
    工业品价格，在正常流转的情况下，销地应高于产地，乡村应高于城市。逐步扭转工业品城乡价格倒差，把过去乡村消费者额外多得的经济利益，集中起来由国家投入到工业建设中去，这是有利于全国人民的根本利益的，同时也是有利于农民的利益的。
