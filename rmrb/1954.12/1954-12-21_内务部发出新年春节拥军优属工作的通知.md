The Ministry of Interior of the People's Republic of China issued a notice on carrying out activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs during the 1955 New Year and Spring Festival.

The notice said: The 1955 New Year and Spring Festival are approaching. Various localities can carry out various activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs according to the customs of the local people. For example, hold small-scale symposiums for families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers at the township or urban district/street level; hold joint celebrations with local troops, hold New Year's greetings gatherings and visits, etc. Through these activities, publicize the task of liberating Taiwan, strengthen the unity between the army and the people, encourage families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to work hard and actively participate in mutual aid and cooperative production, communicate with soldiers, and encourage each other; educate the people to further improve the work of giving preferential treatment, care for the production and life of families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers, and enthusiastically respond to the state's call for conscription and replenishment of soldiers to support the task of liberating Taiwan. When conducting this education, attention should be paid to publicizing the deeds of local model figures, especially in places where model figures for preferential treatment are being selected, this should be closely integrated with the work of selecting model figures for preferential treatment.

The notice then pointed out: In conjunction with activities to support the army and give preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, counties, districts, and townships should conduct a good review and summary of the work of giving preferential treatment in the past year. The focus of the review and summary should be, in rural areas, the experience gained and existing problems in organizing families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative production and substitute farming; in urban areas, the experience gained and existing problems in organizing families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers to engage in small-scale cooperative production and household handicrafts, as well as rectifying existing production units. At the same time, both in rural and urban areas, the use and effectiveness of preferential treatment funds should be checked. Through review and summary, the situation should be thoroughly clarified, experiences exchanged, existing problems in the work resolved, and the achievements consolidated, and these tasks should be greatly advanced.

The notice requires all provinces (cities) and counties (cities) to formulate a plan for the work of giving preferential treatment for the entire year of 1955 based on the information they have learned, especially on how to centrally use preferential treatment funds to support families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers to participate in mutual aid and cooperative production. Specific arrangements should be made as soon as possible, and work groups should be sent down to help district and township cadres work and identify the targets of subsidies as soon as possible. A comprehensive understanding of the current living conditions of families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers should be conducted. Individual orphans, elderly, sick, and weak people who have real difficulties in life can be given a subsidy before the New Year to ensure that they can celebrate the Spring Festival like the masses.

    通知接着指出：结合拥军优属的活动，县、区、乡应对当地一年来的优抚工作进行很好的检查和总结。检查总结的重点，在农村，应是组织烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加互助合作生产及代耕工作中取得的经验和存在的问题；在城市，应是组织烈属、军属从事合作社性质的小生产和家庭手工业以及对现有生产单位进行整顿中取得的经验和存在的问题。同时，无论农村和城市，都应检查使用优抚事业费的情况和效果，通过检查总结，彻底弄清情况，交流经验，解决工作中现存的各种问题，巩固既得的成绩，并把这些工作再大大地向前推进一步。
