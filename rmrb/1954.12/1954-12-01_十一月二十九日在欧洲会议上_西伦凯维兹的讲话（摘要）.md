　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 30th: Si-Rankiewicz, head of the Polish People's Republic delegation, spoke at the first meeting of the Moscow Conference on Ensuring European Peace and Security on the 29th. He said that the delegation of the Polish People's Republic attended the European countries' conference to discuss, together with other countries that have a vital stake in the new situation, measures to ensure European peace and security. This new situation is caused by the Western countries' governments' conspiracy to rebuild the aggressive new Hitler Wehrmacht by all means.
　　Si-Rankiewicz said that the Polish government attaches great importance to the European countries' conference and is prepared to do its part to implement the principles agreed upon by everyone, so as to coordinate our efforts to ensure the common security of peace-loving countries in the new situation, thereby also ensuring the security of Poland and the Polish border, and the safety of the Polish people.
　　Si-Rankiewicz explained that German militarism is not the first time it has threatened the people of European countries with incalculable disasters. He said that the Soviet Union pointed out a road to peace at the Berlin Conference and in several notes to Western countries in recent months: the road to friendship with a peace-loving Germany free from militarism.
　　Si-Rankiewicz continued, there is a very clear path to a unified Germany. But there is also a completely opposite path, which is the path of ratifying the Paris Accords. This path will produce unprecedented dangerous consequences. First, it means maintaining the division of Germany. However, maintaining the division of Germany will inevitably lead to a sharpening of the international situation in Europe, thus exacerbating the danger of war. Second, ratifying the Paris Accords means establishing new military blocs of some countries against other European countries, including Poland. Si-Rankiewicz emphasized that before the agreement to rearm West Germany is ratified, all avenues for countries to negotiate a peaceful resolution of the German question, with Germany's participation, are still open, and it is possible to achieve the unification of Germany on a democratic and peaceful basis. Ratifying the agreement to rearm West Germany will block these paths.
　　Si-Rankiewicz pointed out that the inevitability of arming Germany is a fabrication, because there were conditions after World War II to eradicate German militarism and eliminate its harm once and for all. Si-Rankiewicz pointed out that the peace camp, with the Soviet Union as the main force, opposes the policy of war, opposes the policy of pursuing war profits and expanding armaments.
　　Si-Rankiewicz continued, the people of Europe earnestly hope that lasting peace and security on our European continent can be guaranteed. The only correct path to achieve this goal is to establish a common collective security system, which can bring the people of all countries closer, eliminate tensions in international relations, and achieve disarmament. This is the program put forward by the Soviet Union and other countries in the peace camp. Si-Rankiewicz said, however, anyone who regards the hand extended by our countries as a sign of weakness or a willingness to abandon sovereignty is greatly mistaken.
　　Si-Rankiewicz said that if Western politicians, disregarding all the historical experience of the people of all countries, disregarding the public opinion of European countries, still insist on ratifying the Paris Accords, it will cause a new situation, prompting peace-loving countries to use new methods and means to protect their security. He pointed out that this new situation undoubtedly requires increasing the defense capabilities of peace-loving countries.
　　Si-Rankiewicz said that when all countries that implement a policy of peace and international security unite their forces to prevent new dangers, when these forces cooperate with each other, and when organizational forms are determined to unite our defense measures, then the effectiveness of the measures we take will be even greater.
　　Finally, Si-Rankiewicz, on behalf of the Polish delegation, expressed his conviction that this meeting can definitely determine the common direction of efforts agreed upon by all participating countries to protect the people of these countries from aggression.

    十一月二十九日在欧洲会议上
    西伦凯维兹的讲话（摘要）
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：波兰人民共和国代表团团长西伦凯维兹二十九日在保障欧洲和平和安全的莫斯科会议第一次会议上讲话。他说，波兰人民共和国代表团出席欧洲国家会议，来跟其他同新的形势有切身利害关系的国家共同讨论保障欧洲和平和安全的措施，这种新形势是由于西方国家的政府企图用一切办法重建侵略性的新希特勒国防军这一阴谋所造成的。
    西伦凯维兹说，波兰政府十分重视欧洲国家会议，并准备尽自己的一份力量，实施大家同意的原则，以便配合我们的力量来在新的形势下保障爱好和平的国家的共同安全，从而也就是保障波兰和波兰边境的安全，保障波兰人民的安全。
    西伦凯维兹说明，德国军国主义并不是第一次以无法估计的灾难威胁欧洲各国人民。他说，苏联在柏林会议上和最近几个月来给西方国家的几次照会中指出了一条走向和平的道路：同一个爱好和平的、摆脱了军国主义的德国友好的道路。
    西伦凯维兹接着说道，有一条非常明确的统一德国的道路。但是也有一条完全相反的道路，这就是批准巴黎协定的道路。这条道路会产生空前的危险后果。首先，它意味着保持德国的分裂。然而保持德国的分裂必然导致欧洲国际局势的尖锐化，因此也就是加剧战争的危险。其次，批准巴黎协定就意味着建立一些国家的新的军事集团来反对另一些欧洲国家，其中包括波兰。西伦凯维兹强调指出，在没有批准重新武装西德的协定之前，在有德国参加的情况下，各国协商和平解决德国问题的所有道路还是打开的，并且能够达到在民主和平的基础上统一德国。批准重新武装西德的协定，就将堵塞这些道路。
    西伦凯维兹指出，武装德国不可避免论是捏造的，因为第二次世界大战后有这样的条件，可以铲除德国军国主义，而且可以一劳永逸地消灭它的危害。西伦凯维兹指出，以苏联为主要力量的和平阵营反对战争政策，反对追求战争利润和扩充军备的政策。
    西伦凯维兹接着说，欧洲人民热烈希望我们欧洲大陆上的持久和平和安全能够得到保证。达到这个目的的唯一正确道路就是建立共同的集体安全体系，它可以使各国人民接近，可以消除国际关系中的紧张局势和达到裁减军备。这就是苏联同和平阵营其他国家所提出的纲领。西伦凯维兹说道，然而，谁要是把我们这些国家伸出来的手看成是软弱的表现或是愿意放弃主权的表现，那就大错特错了。
    西伦凯维兹说，假使西方的政治家不顾各国人民的全部历史经验，不顾欧洲各国的社会舆论，仍然要进行批准巴黎协定的话，那就将引起一种新的局势，促使爱好和平的国家用新的方法和手段来保障它们的安全。他指出，这种新的局势毫无疑问地要求增加爱好和平国家的防御力量。
    西伦凯维兹说，当执行和平和国际安全政策的一切国家把自己的力量联合起来以防止新的危险的时候，当这些力量互相配合起来的时候，当确定了组织形式以联合我们的防御措施的时候，那么，我们所采取的措施的效力就会更大。
    西伦凯维兹最后代表波兰代表团表示，确信现在这个会议一定可以确定所有参加会议国家一致同意的共同努力的方针，以保卫这些国家的人民不受侵略。
