Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 6th: Sources here believe that the statements made by Swedish Representative Solman at the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee meeting regarding the work of the Korean Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) do not conform to the facts.

According to a United Press report, Solman said at the UN General Assembly Political Committee meeting on the 2nd that "the majority of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission's actions have been deadlocked due to two-to-two votes." The fact is that the four member nations of the NNSC have jointly made many resolutions and instructions, carried out a great deal of work, and played an active role in supervising the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Taking the review of the comprehensive reports on rotations and replacements by both sides of the armistice in April, May, June, and July of this year as an example, they were all jointly signed by the four member nations and submitted to the Military Armistice Commission. On November 2nd of this year, the four member nations of the NNSC jointly passed instructions to the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at various rear ports in Korea regarding the improvement of inspection methods. The instructions clearly stipulated the important principles for the teams to carry out their inspection work, which greatly helped the port teams improve their inspection work. As recently as November 24th, the four member nations of the NNSC re-revised the 26 preliminary instructions for the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, making them formal instructions.

Solman also said that the NNSC "lacks supervision over North Korea" and that "the supervision of North Korea is not as 'extensive' as that of South Korea." Opening the records of the NNSC, it can be seen that the opposite is true. The Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at various rear ports in North Korea have fully carried out their inspection work due to the cooperation and assistance of the Korean-Chinese side. The Korean-Chinese side submitted detailed and accurate reports to the teams before each rotation and replacement. The teams could conduct spot checks and inspections day and night, open train carriages and board trains for inspection, and open boxes for inspection. The teams enjoyed full freedom and convenience within the port areas. As of the end of November this year, the teams stationed at various ports in North Korea had conducted 1,721 inspections.

However, the work of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams stationed at various rear ports in South Korea has been subject to various restrictions by the US side, which has virtually rendered the inspection teams unable to perform their tasks. Since the armistice, the US side has consistently refused to implement the agreement that both sides of the armistice should submit prior reports to the teams before carrying out rotations and replacements. Since April 15th of this year, the US side has unilaterally implemented the so-called "new method" to further restrict the work of the teams. In response to this situation, the four member nations of the NNSC jointly passed an instruction to the teams on November 2nd of this year, reiterating the necessity for both sides of the armistice to provide prior reports to the teams. However, the US side still refuses to fulfill this obligation. The instructions given to the teams by the NNSC stipulated that the teams should board ships for inspection and open boxes for inspection. However, the US side has also consistently refused to implement this. During the Geneva Conference and in July and August of this year, the US side wantonly spread remarks undermining the NNSC. Encouraged by the US side, Syngman Rhee, Won Yong-duk and other South Korean warmongers carried out a series of threats, harms, and acts of violence against the personnel of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams, even going so far as to shoot at and throw bombs at the team personnel. The US side, on the one hand, condoned these acts of undermining the agreement, and on the other hand, used the pretext of "protecting" the team personnel to further restrict the activities of the teams. In South Korea, the team personnel not only lack the freedom to inspect, but even lack personal freedom, and their lives are even threatened.

Currently, the Korean people and peace-loving people around the world are striving to implement the Armistice Agreement and quickly resolve the Korean issue peacefully, while American warmongers and the Syngman Rhee clique are painstakingly trying to abolish the NNSC so that they can more unscrupulously prepare for the resumption of war in South Korea. At this time, it is regrettable that the Swedish representative has made statements at the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee meeting that do not conform to the actual work situation of the NNSC and negate the role of the NNSC.

### 中立国监察委员会的纪录就是证明——开城人士评论瑞典代表在联大政委会的发言

    中立国监察委员会的纪录就是证明
    ——开城人士评论瑞典代表在联大政委会的发言
    【新华社开城六日电】　此间人士认为瑞典代表索尔曼在联合国大会政治委员会会议上发表的关于朝鲜中立国监察委员会工作情况的言论并不符合事实。
    据合众社报道：索尔曼二日在联合国大会政治委员会会议上说：“中立国监察委员会大多数的行动都由于二对二的表决而陷于僵局。”事实是，中立国监察委员会四国委员曾经共同作出过许多决议和指示，进行了许多工作，在监察朝鲜停战的实施方面，起了积极的作用。就以今年四、五、六、七月份的关于停战双方轮换替换综合报告的审定来说，都是由四国委员共同签署提交给军事停战委员会的。今年十一月二日中立国监察委员会四国委员共同通过关于改进视察方法问题对驻于朝鲜各后方口岸的中立国视察小组的指示，指示中明确规定了小组进行视察工作的重要原则，这个指示极有助于各口岸小组改进它们的视察工作。就在十一月二十四日，中立国监察委员会四国委员还重新修订了对中立国视察小组的二十六项初步指示，使它成为正式指示。
    索尔曼还说：中立国监察委员会“对朝鲜北部缺乏监督”，“对朝鲜北部的监察不如对南朝鲜的‘广泛’”。翻开中立国监察委员会的记录，可以看出事实正好相反。驻在朝鲜北部各后方口岸的中立国视察小组由于得到了朝中方面的合作和协助，充分地进行了它们的视察工作。朝中方面在每次进行轮换替换以前都向小组提出了详细而准确的报告。小组无论在白天黑夜都可以进行抽查视察，小组可以打开火车厢上火车视察，可以开箱视察。小组在口岸地区内享有充分的自由和便利。驻在朝鲜北部各口岸的小组到今年十
  一月底为止已经进行了一千七百二十一次视察。
    但是，驻在南朝鲜各后方口岸的中立国视察小组的工作，一直受到美方的种种限制，使视察小组实际上陷于不能执行其工作任务的境地。美方从停战以来，就一直拒不执行停战双方应在进行轮换替换以前向小组提出事先报告的协议，从今年四月十五日以后，美方又片面实行所谓“新办法”进一步地限制小组的工作。针对着这种情况，中立国监察委员会四国委员在今年十一月二日共同通过的一项对小组的指示中曾重申了停战双方向小组提供事先报告的必要。但是，美方到现在仍拒不履行此项义务。中立国监察委员会给小组的指示中规定：小组应上船视察，开箱视察。但美方也一直拒不执行。在日内瓦会议期间和今年七、八月间，美方大肆散布破坏中立国监察委员会的言论，在美方的鼓励下，李承晚、元容德等南朝鲜好战分子曾对中立国视察小组的人员进行了一系列的威胁、危害、和暴力行为，甚至发展到向小组人员射击、投掷炸弹。美方一方面纵容这些破坏协定的行为，另一方面又以“保护”小组人员为借口，对小组的活动进一步加以限制。在南朝鲜，小组人员不仅没有视察的自由，甚至没有人身自由，连生命都遭到威胁。
    目前，朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民正力争贯彻停战协定，并迅速地和平解决朝鲜问题，而美国好战分子和李承晚集团却正在处心积虑地要取消中立国监察委员会以便更加无顾忌地在南朝鲜进行恢复战争的准备，在这个时候，瑞典代表竟在联合国大会政治委员会会议上发出了和中立国监察委员会的实际工作情况不相符合并否定中立国监察委员会的作用的言论，这是不能不令人感到遗憾的。
