Shanghai Implements Wholesale Purchase System for All Coal Merchants

The Shanghai branch of the China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company has implemented a wholesale purchase system for all private coal retailers and vendors in the city, starting in November. This marks another step forward in the socialist transformation of private coal merchants in Shanghai. Currently, there are 1,747 retailers and 83 vendors engaged in the retail of coal briquettes and coal in Shanghai. These retailers and vendors have all signed wholesale purchase contracts with the Shanghai Coal Industry Construction Materials Company, submitted wholesale purchase applications and purchase plans, and completed the wholesale purchase procedures. The wholesale purchase contract stipulates that all coal briquettes and coal handled by private retailers must be purchased from the state-owned Coal Industry Construction Materials Company, and must be sold at prices stipulated by the state-owned company. Hoarding, refusal to sell, price gouging, and short weighing are prohibited. The contract also stipulates that private coal retailers and vendors must prepare monthly purchase plans fifteen days before the start of each month and submit them to the state-owned Coal Industry Construction Materials Company for review. The state-owned Coal Industry Construction Materials Company has the right to inspect the business operations of all coal retailers and vendors at any time. Private merchants must actively accept the leadership and supervision of the state-owned company. In order to facilitate the procurement of goods for coal briquette retailers with limited funds, the Shanghai Coal Industry Construction Materials Company has made appropriate adjustments to the starting point for wholesale coal briquettes. The transportation company has also strengthened the transportation of coal briquettes. The People's Bank has also provided loans to vendors with insufficient funds, and more than 290 households have received timely loans. State-owned companies and cooperatives have also made necessary adjustments to coal prices. At present, the source of goods for all private coal retailers and vendors has been fully guaranteed, and the consumption needs of the general public for coal briquettes and coal can be better met.

    上海对全市煤商实行批购
    中国煤业建筑器材公司上海市公司从十一月份起，对全市私营煤业零售商和煤业摊贩实行全行业批购，上海市私营煤商的社会主义改造工作又向前迈进了一步。目前，上海市经营煤球和煤的零售商有一千七百四十七户，摊贩有八十三户。这些零售商贩都先后同上海市煤业建筑器材公司订立批购合约，并提出了批购申请书和购货计划，办理了批购手续。批购合约规定：各私营零售商经营的煤球和煤，必须全部向国营煤业建筑器材公司进货，并应按照国营公司规定的价格出售，不得有囤积、拒卖、抬价和短秤等违法行为。合约中还规定：私营煤业零售商贩要按月在月度前十五天编造购货计划，送国营煤业建筑器材公司审核。国营煤业建筑器材公司有权随时检查各煤业零售商贩的经营情况。私商要主动接受国营公司的领导和监督。上海市煤业建筑器材公司为了便利资金少的煤球零售商进货，已经将煤球起批点作了适当调整。搬运公司也加强了煤球运送工作。人民银行也贷款给资金不足的商贩，现在已经有二百九十多户及时得到了贷款。国营公司和合作社还对煤价进行了必要的调整。现在，各私营煤业零售商贩的货源都得到了充分的保证，广大市民对煤球和煤的消费需要也能更好地得到满足。　（本报上海记者站）
