Guangdong Province Trains Farmer Water Conservancy Technicians

    This winter and next spring, Guangdong Province will undertake more than 18,700 medium- and small-scale farmland water conservancy projects involving irrigation, flood control, and tidal defense. The total benefited area will reach more than 7,310,000 mu, of which about 840,000 mu will be converted from single-crop to double-crop and dry land to paddy fields. At present, the key projects in various regions have mostly completed design, and some have already started construction.

    In order to solve the difficulty of lacking technical guidance in farmland water conservancy construction, most counties have held training classes for farmer water conservancy technicians. These classes train agricultural production cooperative and mutual aid group backbones with primary school education, enthusiastic farmers and activists who are dedicated to water conservancy work, water conservancy models, and junior high school graduates engaged in agricultural production. The regions of eastern Guangdong, Hainan, and central Guangdong alone plan to train more than 5,600 people. (Huang Zhenzhong)

    广东省训练农民水利技术员
    广东省今冬明春将兴办灌溉、防洪、防潮等中、小型农田水利工程一万八千七百多宗，全部受益田将达七百三十一万多亩，其中单造变双造和旱地变水田共约八十四万亩。目前，各地重点工程大部已进行设计，有的已开始施工。
    为了解决农田水利施工中缺乏技术指导的困难，多数县都举办了农民水利技术员训练班，训练一些有小学文化水平的农业生产合作社及互助组骨干、热心水利工作的农民积极分子，水利模范，从事农业生产的初中毕业生等。只是粤东、海南、粤中等地区就计划训练了五千六百多名。　（黄振中）
