Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: In the nine days from the 6th to the 14th, over 26,000 people have visited the “Exhibition of American Espionage Crimes” held in Beijing. Visitors included workers, farmers, state organ personnel, People's Liberation Army soldiers, students, and city residents.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and Dalai Lama Danzeng Jiacuo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, visited the exhibition.

Diplomatic envoys and embassy staff from various countries stationed in China, as well as foreign journalists in Beijing, also visited the exhibition. Visitors carefully viewed the weapons, radios, and other substantial evidence of American espionage activities on display at the exhibition. Many visitors frequently stood around the air retrieval device used by the American spy Downey to take the special agent Li Junying away from the air. People also carefully read the confessions written by the American spies themselves. In Arnold's confession, he admitted that he was the Colonel Commander of the "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing," and that this wing was used to carry out espionage activities against China and the Soviet Far East coastal areas. Visitors viewed the secret Chinese maps distributed by the U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Chart and Information Center, as well as the pistols seized when Downey and Fecteau were captured. Visitors commented that these items seemed very strange in light of the U.S. government's claim that Downey and Fecteau were "two ordinary passengers on a routine flight from Seoul to Japan."

Since the opening of the exhibition, many visitors have left their opinions in the visitors' book. A visitor, Li Bolin, wrote in the exhibition's visitors' book: "Everything in the exhibition is concrete evidence of the American aggressors' attempts to subvert our people's democratic regime and carry out espionage activities, which cannot be denied by any sophistry!" Zhang Jiayu, a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, said with indignation after visiting the exhibition: "Our cause is sacred. As a revolutionary soldier, I must heighten my revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold to defend the socialist construction of our great motherland!" A visitor from Changchun wrote in the visitors' book: "In the dragnet laid by our people's public security organs and all the people, any destructive conspiracy of the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique will come to naught!"

    “美国空投特务罪证展览会”已有两万多人参观
    观众仔细观看了美国间谍活动的真凭实据
    【新华社十四日讯】从六日到十四日的九天时间内，已有二万六千多人参观了在北京市举办的
  “美国空投特务罪证展览会”。前往参观的有工人、农民、国家机关工作人员、人民解放军战士、学生和市民等。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若、全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措曾前往参观。
    各国驻华使节、使馆人员和在北京的外国记者也参观了展览会。观众们都很仔细地观看了展览会陈列的美国进行间谍活动的武器、电台和其他大批物证。在美国籍间谍唐奈用来从空中带走特务李军英的空取器的周围，经常站着许多观众。人们并仔细阅读了美国籍间谍亲笔写的供词。在阿诺德的供词中供认了他是“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的上校司令官，并供认这个联队是被用来对中国和苏联远东滨海地区进行间谍活动的。参观的人观看了美国空军航空地图情报局分发的秘密中国地图，以及在唐奈和费克图被俘获时所缴获的手枪。观众纷纷谈论道：这些东西对美国政府一口咬定唐奈和费克图是“一次从汉城到日本的例行飞行的两位寻常旅客”说来，似乎是很奇异的。
    自展览会开幕以来，许多观众在意见簿上都留下了自己的意见。观众李柏林在展览会的意见簿上写道：“展览会的一切都是美国侵略者妄图颠覆我人民民主政权、进行间谍活动的真凭实据，是任何狡辩不能抵赖的！”人民解放军战士张嘉煜参观展览会后激愤地说：“我们的事业是神圣的，作为一个革命军人，我要百倍地提高革命警惕，保卫我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业！”长春市一个参观者在意见簿上写道：“在我们人民公安机关和全体人民所布的天罗地网里，美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团的任何破坏阴谋都将成为泡影！”
