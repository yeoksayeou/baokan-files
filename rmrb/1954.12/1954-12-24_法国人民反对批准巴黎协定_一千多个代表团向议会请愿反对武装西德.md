Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 22nd: According to TASS, over a thousand delegations from all over France came to Paris on the 21st to petition the National Assembly, demanding that it reject the Paris Accords on rearming West Germany.

Deputy Cochard (Independent Republican) said when receiving a delegation of residents from Longueville (Seine-et-Marne): "I oppose the London and Paris Accords that revive the German Wehrmacht. I advocate convening a Four Power conference. Since the aim of the London and Paris Accords is to oppose the Soviet Union, I understand the recent note presented by the Soviet Union, because we cannot forget that France and the Soviet Union have a mutual assistance treaty."

"l'Humanité" pointed out that the active expression of the French people's wishes has influenced many wavering deputies; a good number of these deputies finally indicated that they will vote against ratification of the Paris Accords. For example, Deputy Croizier (Independent Republican) initially did not offer any definite response when receiving delegations. However, after fifty delegations visited him yesterday, he said: "I have been defeated by the force of public opinion. I will vote against."

A large number of state organ employees, including personnel from the Privy Council, the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, and responsible personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, jointly wrote a letter to the deputies, asking them to "carefully consider the particular gravity of this vote, which may legitimize the arming of West Germany."

"l'Humanité" also published a large list of enterprises that held short strikes on the 21st to protest the new plans to arm West Germany.

    法国人民反对批准巴黎协定
    一千多个代表团向议会请愿反对武装西德
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：法国全国各地有一千多个代表团来到巴黎，在二十一日向国民议会请愿，要求拒绝批准重新武装西德的巴黎协定。
    议员柯夏尔（独立共和党）在接见隆威（塞纳—马恩省）的居民代表团时说：“我反对复活德国国防军的伦敦和巴黎协定。我主张召开四大国会议。既然伦敦和巴黎协定的目的是反对苏联，苏联最近提出的照会我是了解的，因为我们不能忘记法国和苏联订立有互助条约。”
    “人道报”指出，法国人民积极表现的愿望对许多动摇不定的议员起了影响；其中有好些议员终于表示，他们将投票反对批准巴黎协定。例如议员克罗齐埃（独立共和党）起初在接见代表团时，不提出任何肯定的答复。但是，当昨天有五十个代表团访问了他之后，他说：“我被舆论的力量击败了。我将投反对票。”
    有大批国家机关的职员，其中包括枢密院的人员、全国经济统计局的人员以及外交部的负责人员，联名向议员写了一封信，要求他们“慎重考虑这次投票的特别严重性，它可能使西德武装成为合法的事。”
    “人道报”还刊载了一大批曾经在二十一日进行短时间罢工的企业的名单，罢工是为了对武装西德的新计划表示抗议。
