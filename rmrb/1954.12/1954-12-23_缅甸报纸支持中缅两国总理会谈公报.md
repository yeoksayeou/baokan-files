Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 22nd: Burmese anti-fascist People's Freedom League's newspaper "Mandalay Daily" recently published an editorial stating that the Sino-Burmese Prime Ministers' Joint Communiqué not only reflects the common views of the two countries on developing and consolidating friendly relations and matters beneficial to both parties, but also shows that the two countries have reached a common understanding on consolidating world peace and easing international tensions, which is exciting. The editorial supports the common views of the two Prime Ministers on international relations, believing that the consolidation and expansion of the peace zone can ease the current international tensions, thereby reducing the possibility of a new war.

The Burmese newspaper "National Voice" said in its editorial: The agreement reached by the Prime Ministers of China and Burma in their talks is a guarantee for further consolidating and developing the friendship between the two countries. In terms of the spirit of the joint communiqué, China is not only willing to be friendly with Southeast Asian countries, but also willing to cooperate with all countries in the world for the cause of world peace. The editorial said: We hope that other countries can accept the principles of peaceful coexistence proclaimed by the Prime Ministers of China and Burma in the joint communiqué.

The Mandalay "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 15th saying: "Prime Minister U Nu has personally seen that China not only needs to be friendly with the Burmese people, but also deeply loves world peace." The editorial praised Prime Minister U Nu for the friendly assurances he made to China during his visit.
