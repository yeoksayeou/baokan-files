Achievements of the Beijing Materials Exchange Fair

The Beijing Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Fair, which began on November 16th, closed on November 30th. The total transaction value at the fair was over 160 billion yuan. Among them, industrial products and handicrafts sold from the city to the countryside accounted for more than 141 billion yuan, and agricultural and sideline products sold from the countryside to the city accounted for more than 26 billion yuan. More than 1,200 tons of traded goods have already been shipped, and the remaining goods are mostly being organized for shipment.

This materials exchange fair implemented the policy of "giving priority to supplying the countryside with industrial products suitable for rural needs." The Beijing trade delegation sold over 60 billion yuan worth of industrial and handicraft products, many of which were best-selling commodities in Beijing, such as bicycles, sneakers, fruit candies, biscuits, wool yarn, Golden Star fountain pens, and silk fabrics. The fair also discovered many commodities that were overstocked in the city but out of stock in the countryside, such as woolen sweaters, cotton undershirts, and rubber shoes from Changchun and other places, and made reasonable allocations.

The materials exchange fair also paid attention to supporting the production and disaster relief work in some disaster areas. The Beijing Company of the China Native Produce Company and the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased many straw hat braids, washboards, rolling pins, cloth shoes, earth baskets, carrying poles, and small benches produced by disaster victims in the Tianjin and Baoding regions of Hebei Province, and signed an agreement with local supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase carrying baskets, reed mats, and other items worth more than 2 billion yuan. The transaction prices of these commodities were negotiated based on the principle that the purchasing and selling units would not make a profit or would lose less money. The representative of the Xiong County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province happily said after selling more than 16,000 small benches: "Don't think these things aren't worth much money, but they can really solve the livelihood problems of the disaster victims!"

    北京市物资交流会的成就
    北京市从十一月十六日开始举行的城乡物资交流会，已经在十一月三十日闭幕。会上成交总值共有一千六百多亿元。其中城市推销到农村的工业品、手工业品占一千四百一十多亿元，农村销给城市的农业和副业产品占二百六十多亿元。成交物资已经运出一千二百多吨，其余的物资大部分正在组织起运。
    这次物资交流会贯彻了“适合农村需要的工业品优先供应农村”的方针。北京市贸易代表团销出的工业品和手工业品共值六百多亿元，其中很多都是北京市内畅销的商品，如自行车、球鞋、水果糖、饼干、毛线、金星钢笔、绸缎等。会上还发现了不少在城市积压而农村脱销的商品，如长春等地的绒衣、棉毛衫、胶鞋等，都进行了合理的分配。
    物资交流会还注意支援了一些灾区的生产救灾工作。中国土产公司北京市公司和北京市供销合作总社，收购了河北省天津、保定两专区灾民生产的许多草帽辫、洗衣板、赶面杖、布鞋、土筐、扁担、小板凳等物品，并同当地供销合作社签订了收购价值二十多亿元抬筐、苇箔等物品的协议书。这些商品的成交价格，又都是本着购销单位不赚钱或少赔钱的原则商定的。河北省雄县供销合作社的代表在销出一万六千多个小板凳以后愉快地说：“别看这些东西值钱不太多，可是真能解决灾民们的生活问题！”　（晏振陵）
