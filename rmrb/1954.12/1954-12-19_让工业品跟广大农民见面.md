Let Industrial Products Meet the Broad Masses of Farmers
By our reporter Zhang Chao

    At the same time as the national campaign to purchase agricultural products was launched, the Shanghai state-owned commercial departments organized thirty-three visiting sales teams for general merchandise, cotton cloth, medicine, chemicals, transportation and electrical appliances, hardware, etc. They carried samples, brochures, instruction manuals, slides, and other promotional materials to rural areas and mining areas. Through methods such as typical surveys, mobile commodity exhibitions, consumer forums, and individual visits, they introduced industrial products produced in Shanghai to the broad masses of consumers.

    Fifteen general merchandise visiting sales teams, mainly visiting rural areas, were a major force among them. Starting in October, in just over a month, their footprints extended north to Heilongjiang, west to Urumqi, and south to Yunnan, covering more than half of the provinces and cities in the country. While promoting and selling, they also specifically learned about the consumption habits and needs of farmers, and humbly listened to farmers' criticisms and opinions about Shanghai industrial products.

    In the past, many industrial products from Shanghai were sold throughout the country, but the Shanghai state-owned commercial departments did not fully understand the needs and habits of the vast rural consumers. After these general merchandise visiting sales teams went to the countryside, they saw a new picture: with the great development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, farmers' purchasing power has greatly increased, and their consumption habits have also changed significantly.

    In Jiaotan Township on the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang Province, before liberation, not a single farmer's household used a thermos bottle; now, 90 percent of the households have thermos bottles. Before liberation, only 20 percent of the people wore undershirts (all landlords and rich peasants), now that number has risen to 60 percent. People who used to wear cloth socks now wear cotton socks. Men wear a pair a year for working in the fields, and women wear three pairs a year. Before liberation, people wore wooden-soled shoes in the rain, now everyone has a pair of rubber shoes.

    In Lingchuan County, Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, only ten mimeograph machines were sold last year. With the great development of agricultural producers' cooperatives this year, sixty machines were sold in less than a year, and sales of ink, stencils, and steel plates also increased. Alarm clocks are sold out as soon as they arrive in stores. Bicycle sales in Shanxi Province have exceeded all previous records.

    When the general merchandise visiting sales team arrived at the Oriental Red Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Shaanxi Province, all six pairs of rubber shoes, three open-front undershirts, one woolen blanket, and one set of children's clothing they brought were bought by the cooperative members. Mauve socks have become a bestseller in Yan'an because their color harmonizes with the color of the loess plateau in northern Shaanxi.

    The consumption habits of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang Province have also changed significantly. Herdsmen who did not use "foreign soap" in the past now love Gu Ben soap. They are very satisfied with the batch of large rubber shoes that Shanghai has trial-produced for them, and they also love the small hand-cranked sewing machines.

    The general merchandise visiting teams also figured out many sales patterns in rural areas. In the Northwest, "June is big, May is small," because May is the wheat harvest season, when people are both busy and have less money. In June, when the wheat is threshed, farmers have spare money and free time, and they go to the market to buy some daily necessities. In the Zhoushan Islands of Zhejiang Province, there is another pattern: in the first and fourth quarters, open-front cotton sweaters and pants, and undershirts and pants, sell particularly well. Fishermen wear these cotton textiles when they go out to sea to fish in cold weather, which is both convenient and warm. In the second quarter, undershirts, towels, and soap are necessities for fishermen. In the third quarter, fishermen have to prepare for winter, and wool yarn becomes a bestseller again. In Jiangxi Province, there are many rainy seasons throughout the year, so rubber shoes have become a bestseller all year round.

    After the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth and grain, a new consumption pattern has emerged in rural areas: on the one hand, farmers have expanded their demand for daily necessities, transferring part of their purchasing power to daily necessities; on the other hand, they are able to rationally allocate their income. For example, in a village called Nandongye in Anyang County, Henan Province, farmers deposit 20 percent of the money they get from selling agricultural products to the state in the bank, use 50 percent to buy means of production, and the remaining 30 percent to buy consumer goods.

    These situations show that deeply understanding the rural market situation, figuring out farmers' purchasing power, consumption habits, and consumption patterns is an important key for state-owned commerce to improve the quality of its work and better serve farmers.

    In the farmer forums held in various places and the visits to individual farmers, the general merchandise visiting sales teams heard farmers' criticisms and opinions about Shanghai industrial products.

    Farmers have the most criticisms and opinions about the following industrial products:

    Ball rubber shoes: The toe and sole are too narrow (especially Double Coin and Warrior brand ball rubber shoes). A farmer from Henan Province stretched out a foot wearing ball rubber shoes at a forum for the team members to see. The cloth surface of the toe of the ball rubber shoe had already broken after being worn for only a short time. The farmer said: "We peasants go up and down the mountains and fields every day, and our feet are particularly wide. Factories should consider the actual situation and make more larger shoes for us peasants, and the toe and sole must be wider."

    Undershirts and pants: The shirts are not open-front, the sleeves are all with elastic cuffs, and the waist and armpits are too narrow. Farmers find it troublesome to put on and take off, and it is especially inconvenient to work in the fields. The crotch and trouser legs of the pants are too small, and the trouser legs also have elastic cuffs, which do not meet the needs of farmers. Farmers in many places in the north have the habit of squatting on the ground to eat, chat, and rest. Once they squat down, the crotch of their pants will break. Therefore, farmers are asking for a change in the style.

    Thermos bottles: The glass liners of bamboo-cased thermos bottles are not strong and often explode; there are no handles, making them inconvenient to carry when going up and down the mountains and fields.

    Farmers also criticized the lack of variety and colors in various industrial products.

    The general merchandise visiting sales teams carefully compiled these criticisms and opinions into reports and sent them to the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National General Merchandise Corporation, which then passed them on to relevant industrial departments for research and improvement. Some of the staff members of the Shanghai state-owned factories were also in the general merchandise visiting sales team, and they directly reported the farmers' criticisms and opinions to the factories. Some of the shortcomings of the industrial products were quickly improved. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National General Merchandise Corporation first changed most of the existing Western-style undershirts to fully open-front undershirts, which were very popular among farmers. Farmers in Yugou Town, Huaiyin County, Jiangsu Province, said with great emotion: "In the past, factories and stores did not care about the needs of farmers. Now the People's Government brings daily necessities to us and asks for our opinions. They really care about us!"

    The commodity mobile exhibitions held by the general merchandise visiting sales teams in various places aroused the interest of the vast rural consumers and also showed that many industrial products had not met the farmers in the past.

    A comrade from the Industry and Commerce Section of the Shangzhi County People's Government in Heilongjiang Province wrote after visiting the commodity exhibition: "We rarely see these commodities in our county, which shows that many industrial products in our country have not directly met the vast rural consumers. I hope you will make suggestions to the higher-level general merchandise wholesale station, sign contracts according to the varieties and specifications proposed by our county's state-owned department stores and farmers, so that our county can fully stock up and promote the timely sale of industrial products to the countryside."

    When a commodity exhibition was held in Jiadian Township, Anyang County, Henan Province, many farmers from nearby came to visit. They said happily: "The goods are beautiful, plentiful, and cheap. This time we have broadened our horizons." Many old women and young women stood in front of the exquisite samples, looking at them again and again, and were reluctant to leave for a long time.

    In various places, after the general merchandise visiting sales teams' exhibitions, forums, surveys, and visits, local department stores, cooperatives, etc. have proposed purchasing plans based on the farmers' demands. By early December, the general merchandise visiting sales teams had completed sales tasks worth more than 153 billion yuan.

    At the same time, the sales teams found that some industrial products could be increased in production this year, and some slow-selling goods such as batteries, soap, and yarn scarves could become bestsellers, and the "brand name goods" mentality was also broken (this mentality is especially not in line with the actual situation in rural areas). These facts show that state-owned commerce still has a broad foundation for expanding sources of goods. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National General Merchandise Corporation plans to organize various production units to increase the production of goods worth more than 150 billion yuan in the fourth quarter and increase several new varieties according to the needs of rural consumers.

    This visit to the countryside by the Shanghai general merchandise visiting sales teams is not only conducive to completing this year's state-owned commercial plan, but more importantly, it promotes the fine style of the state-owned commercial workers and sets an example for state-owned commerce to further serve production and the vast rural consumers.

    让工业品跟广大农民见面
    本报记者　张潮
    在全国展开农产品收购工作的时候，上海国营商业部门组织了百货、棉布、医药、化工、交通电器、五金等三十三个访问推销队，携带样品、样本、说明书、幻灯等宣传资料，到农村和矿区，用典型调查、商品巡回展览、消费者座谈会、个别访问等方式，向广大消费者介绍上海出产的工业品。
    十五个以访问农村为主的百货访问推销队，是其中的一支主力。从十月间出发，一个多月光景，他们的足迹北至黑龙江、西至乌鲁木齐，南至云南，遍及全国半数以上的省、市。他们一边宣传推销，指导消费；一边具体了解农民的消费习惯和需要，虚心倾听农民对上海工业品的批评和意见。
    过去，上海有不少工业品行销全国，可是，上海国营商业部门并不完全了解广大农村消费者的需要和习惯。这次百货访问推销队下乡后，看到了一幅新的图景：在互助合作运动大大发展之后，农民购买力有了很大的提高，消费习惯也有很大变化。
    浙江省舟山群岛上的礁潭乡，解放前没有一个农户用热水瓶，现在百分之九十的农户有了热水瓶；解放前穿卫生衫的人只有百分之二十（都是地主、富农），现在上升到了百分之六十；解放前穿老布袜的人，现在都改穿线袜，男人要下田每年穿一双，妇女每年穿三双；解放前人们下雨穿木板底鞋，现在每人有一双橡胶鞋。
    山西省长治专区陵川县，去年只销出十架油印机，今年农业生产合作社大发展，不到一年，就销了六十架，跟着，油墨、腊纸、钢板等的销路也广了。闹钟一到商店，就立刻销光。自行车在山西全省的销路超出了历年记录。
    百货访问推销队到了陕西东方红农业生产合作社，他们带去的六双胶鞋、三件开襟卫生衫、一条线毯、一套童装，全被社员们买去了。雪青色的袜子在延安成了畅销品，因为它的颜色跟陕北黄土高原的色彩相调和。
    新疆省少数民族的消费习惯也大有变化，过去不用“洋皂”的牧民，现在爱上了固本皂。他们对上海为他们试制的一批大型胶鞋很满意，也爱上了小巧玲珑的手摇缝纫机。
    百货访问队还摸清了许多在农村的销售规律。西北是“六月大、五月小”，原因是五月是麦收季节，既不闲、钱也不多；六月麦子上场，农民有了余钱和闲空，就要到市集上去买些日用品。在浙江省的舟山群岛，另有一种规律：第一、四季度，开襟的棉毛衫裤、卫生衫裤销路特别大，渔民们在寒冷天气出海捕鱼，穿上这种棉织品，又灵便、又暖和。第二季度汗衫、毛巾、肥皂是渔民的必需品，第三季度渔民要过冬，毛线又变成了畅销品。在江西省，全年雨季多，胶鞋便成了全年的畅销品。
    在棉布、粮食等实行统购统销后，农村中出现了一种新的消费规律：一方面，农民们扩大了对日用品的要求，把一部分购买力转移到了日用品上面；另一方面，他们能够合理地支配收入。比方河南省安阳县有一个叫南洞冶的村子，农民把农产品卖给国家所得到的钱的百分之二十存入了银行，拿百分之五十去买生产资料，其余的百分之三十去买生活资料。
    这些情况说明：深入地了解农村市场的情况，摸清农民的购买力、消费习惯和消费规律，是国营商业提高工作质量、更好地为农民服务的重要关键。
    在各地召开的农民座谈会和对个别农户的访问中，百货访问推销队听到了农民们对上海工业品的批评和意见。
    农民们对下面这些工业品的批评和意见最多：
    球胶鞋：鞋头和鞋底太窄（尤其是双钱牌和力士牌球胶鞋）。一位河南省的农民在座谈会上当场伸出一只穿着球胶鞋的脚来让队员们看。球胶鞋穿上还不久，鞋头布面已破裂。这位农民说：“俺庄稼汉天天上山下地，脚板特别宽。工厂应该考虑实际情况，多给俺庄稼汉做些大号鞋，鞋头鞋底一定要宽些。”
    卫生衫裤：衫子都不开襟，袖筒都是罗口，腰身和脥下太窄，农民都感到穿脱麻烦，特别是下地操作不灵便。裤子的裤裆和裤脚太小，裤脚也是罗口，不合农民的需要。北方许多地方的农民都有蹲在地上吃饭、谈天、休息的习惯，一蹲下，裤裆便绷破了。因此，农民们都要求改变一下形式。
    热水瓶：竹壳热水瓶瓶胆不结实，常炸裂；没有提手，上山下田，携带不方便。
    农民们还批评各种工业品的品种、花色不多。
    百货访问推销队把这些批评和意见都认真地整理成报告，送交中国百货公司上海采购供应站，再转告有关工业部门研究改进。在百货访问推销队里，也有一部分上海国营工厂的工作人员，他们就把农民们的批评和意见直接报告工厂。有些工业品的缺点很快就改进了，中国百货公司上海采购供应站首先把现存的西式卫生衫大部改为全开襟的卫生衫，很受农民欢迎。江苏省淮阴县渔沟镇的农民很感动地说：“过去工厂和商店不关心农民的需要，现在人民政府将日用品也带到我们这里来，还征求我们的意见，真太关心我们了！”
    这次百货访问推销队在各地所举行的商品巡回展览，引起了广大农村消费者的兴趣，也说明了过去还有不少工业品没有和农民见面。
    黑龙江省尚志县人民政府工商科的一位同志参观商品展览会后写道：“我县很少看到这些商品，说明我们国家很多工业品还没有直接跟广大农村消费者见面。希望你们向上级百货批发站提意见，根据我县国营百货公司和农民们提出的品种、规格，签订合同，让我县充分进货，促使工业品能及时销到农村中去。”
    在河南省安阳县贾店乡举行商品展览时，附近农民来参观的很多。他们高兴地说：“货品又美又多又便宜，这回大开眼界了。”许多老婆婆和青年妇女站在精致的样品跟前，看了又看，好久不肯走。
    在各地，经过百货访问推销队展览、座谈、调查、访问，当地百货公司、合作社等根据农民要求，纷纷提出进货计划。到十二月上旬，各路百货访问推销队已完成了一千五百三十多亿元价值的推销任务。
    与此同时，推销队发现了一部分工业品今年还可以增产，一部分滞销货如电池、肥皂、线围巾等可以变成畅销货，“名牌货”思想也被打破了（这种思想尤其不切合农村的实际情况）。这些事实说明了国营商业还有着扩大货源的广泛的基础。中国百货公司上海采购供应站计划组织各生产单位在第四季度内增产价值一千五百多亿元的商品，并根据农村消费者的要求，增加若干新品种。
    这次上海百货访问推销队的下乡，不仅有利于完成今年国营商业计划，而且更重要的是发扬了国营商业工作者的优良作风，树立了国营商业进一步为生产和为广大农村消费者服务的榜样。
