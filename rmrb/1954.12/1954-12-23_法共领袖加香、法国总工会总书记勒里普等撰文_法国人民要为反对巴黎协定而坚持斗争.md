Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 22nd: "Pravda," "Izvestia," and "Trud" published articles by French Communist leader Cachin, French General Confederation of Labour Secretary-General Le Léap and Frachon, and French General Confederation of Labour Secretary Montmousseau. In their articles, they stated that the French people must persist in the struggle against the Paris Agreements.

Cachin, in an article titled "We Must Uphold the Cause of Peace" published in "Pravda," said: The French Communist Party will use all its strength to wage a heroic struggle against France's perfidious policy. The French Communist Party protests the destruction of the Franco-Soviet treaty, the destruction of guarantees for peace and the future of our freedom.

Cachin said: The question of which path France will take will be decided in the coming days. No matter what may happen in the near future, the true people of France will still remember the teachings of Lenin and Stalin and stand on the side of the Soviet Union.

Le Léap, in an article published in "Pravda," pointed out: Mendès-France is unwilling to allow people time to organize a broad patriotic movement against the Paris Agreements. However, in factories, the protest movement against the Paris Agreements is more extensive and active than the movement against the "European Defence Community."

Le Léap said: The working people recognize that the reactionary line of French domestic and foreign policy is mainly the result of increasing American interference in French affairs. This is the main reason for expanding the scale of the struggle. Having recognized that the results of the people's struggle have ended the Vietnam War and led to the rejection of the "European Defence Community" plan, the working masses have great confidence in themselves and their strength, and the French people are increasingly powerfully expressing their will and demand to reject the Paris Agreements.

Frachon pointed out in "Izvestia": Never has such mad deception, slanderous propaganda, and extreme hypocrisy appeared simultaneously as today in implementing a traitorous policy. But the Moscow European Conference has dealt a heavy blow to the deceptive propaganda of the planners of the London and Paris Agreements.

Frachon said: French workers' organizations are mobilizing the broad masses to participate in the movement against the Paris Agreements, bringing it to the peak it reached during the Geneva Conference and the National Assembly's discussion of the "European Defence Community" treaty. The French working class must play a decisive role in the struggle against the aggressive plans to revive the "Bundeswehr" and for peace and collective security in Europe.

Montmousseau, in an article published in "Trud," pointed out: The French people have not forgotten the obligations of the Franco-Soviet treaty. We fully understand the full significance of the warnings issued by the Soviet government in its note of December 16. The ordinary people of France are prepared to do their utmost to turn that treaty concluded with the Soviet Union into a cornerstone of European peace.

    法国人民要为反对巴黎协定而坚持斗争
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”、“消息报”和“劳动报”登载了法国共产党领袖加香、法国总工会总书记勒里普和弗拉商、法国总工会书记蒙慕梭等人的文章。他们在文章中表示：法国人民要为反对巴黎协定而坚持斗争。
    加香在“真理报”上发表题为“我们必须维护和平的事业”的文章说：法国共产党要用一切力量对法国背信弃义的政策进行英勇的斗争。法国共产党抗议破坏法苏条约，破坏对和平和我们自由的未来的保证。
    加香说：法国走上哪条道路的问题就将在今后几天内决定。不管在最近的将来可能发生什么情况，真正的人民的法国仍然会记住列宁和斯大林的教导，站在苏联一边。
    勒里普在“真理报”上发表的文章指出：孟戴斯—弗朗斯不愿意让人们有时间来组织广泛的反对巴黎协定的爱国运动。但是，在工厂中，反对巴黎协定的抗议运动比反对“欧洲防务集团”的运动更加广泛和活跃。
    勒里普说：劳动人民认识到，法国内政和外交政策的反动路线主要是美国对法国事务愈来愈多地进行干涉的结果。这是使斗争规模扩大的主要原因。由于认识到人民斗争的结果已经使越南战争结束，使“欧洲防务集团”计划被拒绝，工人群众对他们自己和他们的力量抱着很大的信心，法国人民正愈来愈有力地表示他们拒绝巴黎协定的意志和要求。
    弗拉商在“消息报”上指出：在实行一个卖国政策时，从来没有像今天这样同时出现这种疯狂的欺骗、诽谤宣传和极端的伪善。但是莫斯科欧洲国家会议已经给了伦敦和巴黎协定策划者的欺骗宣传以沉重的打击。
    弗拉商说：法国工人组织正在动员广大群众参加抗议巴黎协定运动，使它达到在日内瓦会议期间和国民议会讨论“欧洲防务集团”条约期间所达到的那种顶点。法国工人阶级必须在反对复活“国防军”的侵略计划和争取和平和欧洲国家集体安全斗争中起决定作用。
    蒙慕梭在“劳动报”上发表的文章指出：法国人民并没有忘记法苏条约的义务。我们十分了解苏联政府在十二月十六日的照会中所发出的警告的全部重要意义。法国的普通人民准备尽力把那个同苏联缔结的条约变成欧洲和平的基石。
