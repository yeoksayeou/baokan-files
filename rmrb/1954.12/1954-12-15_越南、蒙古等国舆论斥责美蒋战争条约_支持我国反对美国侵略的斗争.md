Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 14th: Vietnamese people from all walks of life have issued statements expressing their approval and support for the statement by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, regarding the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty."

	Nguyen Cong Hoa, Standing Committee member of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, said that the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is a war treaty by which American imperialists attempt to permanently occupy Taiwan and expand their aggression against China. This treaty is part of the overall aggressive conspiracy of American imperialists to prepare for a new world war. In Europe, the United States is intensifying its efforts to revive West German militarism and drag West Germany into an aggressive bloc. In Asia, after the United States gathered its puppet states to establish the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc, it signed this war treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. These situations show that American imperialists are stepping up preparations to ignite a new war and undermine world peace. Nguyen Cong Hoa said that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair. This treaty signed by the American imperialists with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has been abandoned by the Chinese people, is illegal. Nguyen Cong Hoa said that Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is a serious warning to the American imperialists who are attempting to expand their aggression against China and prepare for a new war. Vietnamese workers and the Vietnamese people welcome and support this solemn statement. They believe that the Chinese people, who possess a powerful force, will surely be able to liberate Taiwan and complete the reunification of their motherland.

	Le Dat, a Vietnamese literary and art worker, said that the "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique not only threatens the peace and security of China, but also threatens the peace and security of Asia and the world. We warmly support Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang treaty and firmly support the Chinese people's struggle against American aggression.

	Le Van Chat, a youth representative from the Fifth Interzone of Vietnam, said that the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," like the "Southeast Asia Defense Treaty," threatens the peace and security of China and Asia. We Vietnamese youth warmly endorse Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang treaty. We firmly believe that the Chinese people's struggle to defend their motherland and defend peace will surely be victorious.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 14th: The "Nhan Dan" newspaper published an editorial on the 14th, stating that in the statement issued on December 8th by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on behalf of the People's Republic of China regarding the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," he exposed the aggressive plot of American imperialism and demonstrated the Chinese people's firm will to liberate Taiwan, defend the independence and unity of their motherland, and defend peace in Asia and the world. The Vietnamese people, the Asian people, and all peace-loving people around the world warmly support Zhou Enlai's statement.

	The editorial stated: Taiwan is Chinese territory, and liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair. This is an irrefutable fact. The Chinese people's desire to liberate Taiwan is very legitimate. The Vietnamese people warmly welcome and support the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan. The Vietnamese people, who sympathize with the Chinese people's cause of reunifying their motherland, firmly believe in the victory of the Chinese people.

	The editorial pointed out: After the American imperialists signed an agreement with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, they further implemented their plan to invade China and disrupt peace in Asia. In Vietnam, American imperialism has also further implemented its conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords. It sent Collins to South Vietnam, and its ulterior motive is to turn South Vietnam into a US military base. It is very clear that the US-Chiang aggressive treaty, the Manila Treaty, and the actions of American imperialism in South Vietnam are inseparable parts of a unified aggressive plan by American imperialism aimed at enslaving Southeast Asian countries, attacking China, disrupting peace, and provoking a new war.

	The editorial concluded: The Vietnamese people resolutely condemn the actions of American imperialism and its lackeys in undermining the Geneva Accords. The Vietnamese people will closely unite with the Chinese and Asian people, determined to defeat the plans of American imperialism to undermine the Geneva Accords and contribute to defending peace in Asia and the world.

Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: Ulaanbaatar Dispatch: The Mongolian "Unen" newspaper published an editorial on the 12th entitled "Taiwan Must Be Returned to China," strongly condemning the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The editorial pointed out that the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the American aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has actually turned Taiwan into a US colony and a military base for aggression against the People's Republic of China, seriously threatening peace in Asia and the world. The editorial said that the Chinese people have the strength and determination to liberate Taiwan. Liberating Taiwan is the just cause of the Chinese people, and no country has the right to interfere. The peace-loving Mongolian people fully support the just actions of the Chinese people and warmly endorse the statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai on December 8th.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 14th: The Hungarian "Szabad Nép" published an article on the 12th, refuting the absurd arguments of Western newspapers defending the American occupation of Taiwan, which is Chinese territory. The article said that many Western newspapers frighten people by saying that liberating Taiwan is dangerous and will lead to war throughout Asia or even the world. These newspapers attempt to make people believe that it is not dangerous to accept the status quo and tolerate the American occupation of Taiwan. Obviously, this is a deliberate distortion of the facts. In reality, the real danger is turning Taiwan into a military base and using this base to conduct military provocations against the People's Republic of China. The American imperialists occupy Taiwan in order to use it as a springboard against the 600 million Chinese people. The article said that the American provocative actions against China cannot frighten the Chinese people. People's China is closely united with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. The peace-loving people of the whole world stand on the side of New China.

    越南、蒙古等国舆论斥责美蒋战争条约
    支持我国反对美国侵略的斗争
    【新华社河内十四日电】越南各界人士发表谈话，表示赞同和支持中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明。
    越南总工会常务委员阮功和说，美蒋“共同防御条约”是美帝国主义者企图永久侵占台湾并扩大侵略中国的战争条约。这个条约是美帝国主义者准备新的世界战争的整个侵略阴谋中的一部分。在欧洲，美国正在加紧策划复活西德军国主义，并且把西德拖入侵略集团中去。在亚洲，美国在纠集它的仆从国家建立了东南亚军事侵略集团以后，又同蒋介石集团签订了这个战争条约。这些情况说明，美帝国主义者正在加紧准备燃起新的战火，破坏世界的和平。阮功和说，台湾是中国的领土，解放台湾是中国的内政，美帝国主义者同已被中国人民唾弃的蒋介石集团签订的这个条约是非法的。阮功和说，周恩来关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，是对企图扩大侵略中国，准备新战争的美帝国主义者的一个严重的警告。越南劳动者和越南人民欢迎并且支持这个严正的声明。他们相信，拥有强大力量的中国人民一定能够解放台湾，完成祖国的统一。
    越南文艺工作者黎达说，美国同蒋介石集团签订的“共同防御条约”，不仅威胁了中国的和平和安全，而且威胁了亚洲和世界的和平和安全。我们热烈拥护周恩来关于美蒋条约的声明，并且坚决支持中国人民反对美国侵略的斗争。
    越南第五联区青年代表黎文质说，美蒋“共同防御条约”像“东南亚防务条约”一样，威胁着中国和亚洲的和平和安全。我们越南青年热烈地赞同周恩来外交部长关于美蒋条约的声明。我们坚信，中国人民保卫祖国，保卫和平的斗争一定能够获得胜利。
      【新华社河内十四日电】“人民报”十四日发表社论说，周恩来外长代表中华人民共和国在十二月八日发表的关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明中，揭露了美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，并表明了中国人民解放台湾，保卫祖国的独立和统一、保卫亚洲和世界和平的坚强意志。越南人民、亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民热烈支持周恩来的这一声明。
    社论说：台湾是中国的领土，解放台湾是中国人民的内政，这是不可辩驳的事实。中国人民解放台湾的愿望是非常正当的。越南人民热烈欢迎并支持中国人民对解放台湾的决心。同情中国人民统一祖国事业的越南人民坚信中国人民的胜利。
    社论指出：美帝国主义同蒋介石匪帮签订协定以后，更进一步地实行了它侵略中国和破坏亚洲和平的计划。在越南，美帝国主义也更进一步地实行它破坏日内瓦协定的阴谋。它派柯林斯到南越来，它的不可告人的阴谋就是变南越为美国的军事基地。非常明显，美蒋侵略条约、马尼拉条约和美帝国主义在南越的行动，是美帝国主义旨在奴役东南亚各国、进攻中国、破坏和平和挑起新战争的一个统一的侵略计划中不可分割的部分。
    社论最后说：越南人民坚决控诉美帝国主义及其走狗破坏日内瓦协定的行为。越南人民将同中国和亚洲人民紧密地团结在一起，决心击败美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协定的计划，并为保卫亚洲和世界和平作出贡献。
      【新华社十三日讯】乌兰巴托消息：蒙古“真理报”十二日发表了题为“台湾必须归还中国”的社论，严厉谴责美蒋“共同防御条约”。社论指出，美国侵略集团和蒋介石匪帮签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，实际上把台湾变成了美国的殖民地和侵略中华人民共和国的军事基地，严重地威胁着亚洲和世界和平。社论说，中国人民有力量有决心解放台湾。解放台湾是中国人民的正义事业，任何国家都无权干涉。爱好和平的蒙古人民完全支持中国人民的正义的行动，并且热烈拥护周恩来总理十二月八日发表的声明。
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】匈牙利“自由人民报”十二日刊载了一篇文章，驳斥西方报纸为美国侵占中国的领土台湾辩护的荒谬论调。文章说，许多西方报纸吓人说，解放台湾是危险的，它会导致全亚洲的战争甚至是全世界的战争。这些报纸企图使人相信，安于现状，容忍美国侵占台湾才是不危险的。显然，这是故意歪曲事实。实际上，真正的危险是使台湾变成一个军事基地，并且从这个基地对中华人民共和国进行军事挑衅。美国帝国主义者侵占台湾，就是为了把它用来作为反对六万万中国人民的跳板。文章说，美国对中国的挑衅行动是吓不倒中国人民的。人民中国同苏联和人民民主国家紧紧地团结在一起。全世界和平人民都站在新中国的一边。
