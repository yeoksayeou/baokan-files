"Post-Trial Conversation" Educated Me
To the Editor:
	Every time it's the holiday for picking up and dropping off students, I see a constant stream of cars, big and small, at the gates of some elementary schools for the children of cadres in Beijing.

	As I understand it, the general cadre children's schools have relatively complete facilities, and the students eat, dress, live, and sleep very comfortably. Our children have such a good learning environment, we should work harder to do our jobs well; at the same time, we should cooperate with the school to pay more attention to our children's learning and moral education, and should focus on such a comfortable environment to educate our children to be hardworking and industrious, so that they can develop frugal habits from an early age. Because some comrades do not pay attention to this point, their children have begun to develop the bad habit of being greedy for enjoyment. It is said that some children are so used to riding in cars that they do not want to ride in jeeps or buses, let alone public buses. This is a problem that deserves the attention of parents.

	I have seen some units use group buses to pick up and drop off children. This organized collective method of picking up and dropping off children is worth promoting; some parents even use public buses and pedicabs to pick up and drop off their children, and this spirit of thrift is worth learning from. Of course, taking public buses also has its inconveniences. Some places have too few buses and the vehicles are too crowded, and some schools are in the suburbs, where public bus lines have not yet extended. Therefore, I suggest that organs and groups try to adopt collective pick-up and drop-off methods as much as possible. At the same time, public bus companies should also appropriately increase the number of trips before and after the week-long holidays; in the suburbs, extend the lines to the vicinity of schools as much as possible to relieve the difficulty of parents picking up and dropping off their children.

	The criminal facts of Vladimir and the conversation of his father after the trial educated me, and made me also examine the problems that exist in my own education of my children. I am determined to pay attention to strengthening labor education for my children in the future, and I hope that other parents will pay attention to this issue together.

	Note: Vladimir was an only child, and his father was a famous Soviet engineering economist. Vladimir was very smart when he was young, and his parents doted on him very much. When he was old enough to go to school, his parents sent him to a "special" school. Because his father was busy with work, he completely handed over the responsibility of educating his child to his mother and the school. From then on, the father only listened to his mother's good news every day. One day, the father learned from his mother that his son had made friends with a student with hooligan behavior, and felt that something was not right, but he did not try to prevent this "friendship." Later, he discovered that his son had secretly changed the scores on his report card. The father was very angry and did not give his son any patient education, but beat him up. Soon after, he discovered that his son had stolen. The father originally wanted to take care of it, but he let it go because of his mother's partiality. His son was about to graduate from a ten-year school. From his son's problem of alcoholism, the father realized that his son was not a member of the Communist Youth League, and even the Young Pioneers' red scarf was gone. This problem made the father determined to talk to the principal and the secretary of the Communist Youth League. The result of the conversation was very bad, because the school and the Communist Youth League organization believed that they could not supervise students' actions outside the school, and could not be responsible for those bad behaviors. The secretary of the Communist Youth League even believed that there was no need to care about those backward students. The father realized that the views of the school and the Communist Youth League were incorrect, but he did not pursue this issue to the end. His son graduated from middle school, and his mother secretly bought him a car. As a result, Vladimir drove his car everywhere every day. Because of his mother's doting, because his father did not earnestly take responsibility for educating his son, and because of the incorrect views of the school and the Communist Youth League, Vladimir degenerated from a smart child into a hooligan who deceived, stole, drank, and had indiscriminate relationships with men and women, and was finally sentenced to twenty years in prison for robbery and attempted murder. "Post-Trial Conversation" is the conversation his father gave to reporters after walking out of the courtroom.

### “审判后的谈话”教育了我

    “审判后的谈话”教育了我编辑同志：
    每逢接送学生的假日，我看到北京有些干部子弟小学的大门口，大小汽车来往不绝。
    据我了解，一般的干部子弟学校，设备比较完善，学生吃的、穿的、住的、睡的都很舒服。我们的子女有了这样好的学习环境，我们应该更加努力作好自己的工作；同时配合学校更加注意自己子女的学习和品德教育，而且应该针对着这样舒适的环境，教育子女艰苦勤劳，使子女从小就能养成勤俭朴素的习惯。由于有些同志不注意这一点，他们的子女已开始滋生着贪图享受的恶习。据说有的孩子坐惯了小轿车就不愿意坐吉普车和大汽车，更不愿意坐公共汽车，这是很值得引起家长注意的一个问题。
    我看到有的单位用团体大汽车来接送儿童，这种有组织的集体接送孩童的办法是值得提倡的；有的家长更用公共汽车和三轮车接送自己的子女，这种节约精神是值得我们学习的。当然，坐公共汽车也有不方便的地方，有的地方车次太少，车辆太挤，有的学校在郊区，公共汽车线路还没有伸展到那里。因此，我建议机关团体尽量采取集体接送的办法，同时，公共汽车公司在星期假日前后，也应该适当增加行车班次；在郊区尽可能把线路伸展到学校附近，解除学生家长接送孩子的困难。
    弗拉基米尔的犯罪事实和他的父亲在审判以后的谈话教育了我，使我也检查了一下自己在对子女教育中所存在的问题，决心今后注意对孩子加强劳动教育，同时希望其他家长共同注意这个问题。

    注：弗拉基米尔是一个独生子，他的父亲是苏联著名的工程经济学家。弗拉基米尔小时很聪明，父母对他非常宠爱。到他应该入学的时候，父母就把他送进了一个“特殊的”学校。父亲因为工作忙，就把教育孩子的责任完全交给母亲和学校了。从此父亲只是天天听着母亲报告的好消息。一天，父亲从母亲口中知道儿子和一个有流氓行为的学生交了朋友，觉得有点不大对，但是并没有设法阻止这种“友谊”。以后又发现儿子偷改成绩单上的分数，父亲很生气，没有对儿子进行任何耐心的教育，就把他打了一顿。不久又发现儿子有偷窃行为，父亲本来想管一管，因为母亲的偏袒也就撒手不问了。儿子快要在十年制的学校里毕业了，父亲从儿子酗酒的问题上，才发现儿子还不是青年团员，而且连少先队的红领巾也没有了。这个问题使父亲决心要去找校长和青年团书记谈谈。谈话的结果很不好，因为学校和青年团组织都认为他们不能监督学生在校外的行动，不能对那些坏行为负责，青年团书记更认为用不着去关心那些落后的同学。父亲觉察到学校和青年团的观点不正确，但是并没有一直把这个问题追到底。儿子中学毕业了，母亲偷偷地给他买了一辆小汽车。于是弗拉基米尔就天天开了汽车到处撞，由于母亲的溺爱，由于父亲没有认真负起教育儿子的责任，由于学校和青年团的不正确观点，以致弗拉基米尔一天一天由一个聪明的孩子堕落成为欺骗、偷窃、酗酒、乱搞男女关系的流氓，最后竟因抢劫和企图杀人罪被判处了二十年徒刑。“审判后的谈话”是他的父亲走出法庭后对记者发表的谈话。
