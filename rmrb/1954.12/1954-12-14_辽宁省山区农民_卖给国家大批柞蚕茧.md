    Mountain Farmers in Liaoning Province
    Sell Large Quantities of Tussah Silk Cocoons to the State
    Farmers in the mountainous areas of Liaoning Province are enthusiastically selling tussah silk cocoons to the state to support the production of the silk industry. The total output of tussah silk cocoons in the province this year is estimated to be twenty billion cocoons. The Liaoning Province Tussah Silk Company has been purchasing through supply and marketing cooperatives since October 1st. As of December 10th, according to incomplete statistics, 18.2 billion cocoons have been purchased, more than one and a half times the amount purchased last year.
    This spring, the state issued 10 billion yuan in tussah silk loans to farmers in Liaoning Province. Before the autumn purchasing work began, the Liaoning Province Tussah Silk Company and the supply and marketing cooperatives of relevant counties trained a large number of cadres and technical personnel to master purchasing policies and techniques. During the purchasing process, various localities paid attention to improving purchasing methods and overcoming the shortcomings of overly strict or lenient quality inspection in the past. This year, the state also reasonably increased the purchase price of cocoons. The enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers for silkworm rearing is high, and they have expressed their determination to raise more silkworms next year to support the country's development of silk production.

    辽宁省山区农民
    卖给国家大批柞蚕茧
    辽宁省山区农民踊跃地把柞蚕蚕茧卖给国家，支援制绸工业的生产。今年全省柞蚕茧总产量，据初步估计有二十亿粒。辽宁省柞蚕丝绸公司从十月一日起通过供销合作社进行收购，到十二月十日止，据不完全的统计，已经购进十八亿二千粒，比去年的收购量增加一倍半以上。
    今年春季，国家就发放给辽宁省农民一百亿元的柞蚕贷款。在秋季收购工作开始以前，辽宁省柞蚕丝绸公司和有关县的供销合作社集训了大批干部和技术人员，使他们掌握了收购政策和收购技术。在收购过程中，各地注意改进了收购方法，克服了过去验质偏高或偏低的缺点。今年蚕茧收购价格，国家也合理地加以提高。广大农民养蚕情绪高涨，纷纷表示来年一定要多养蚕，支持国家发展蚕丝生产。　（本报集体通讯员安东市报编辑部）
