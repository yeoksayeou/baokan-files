Xinhua News Agency: The Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China issued a directive on the 11th, requiring state-owned commercial departments in all provinces and cities to organize and plan the supply of essential goods for the upcoming New Year and Spring Festival in 1955.

The directive points out: For the upcoming New Year and Spring Festival, we should not only continue to attach importance to and appropriately ensure the supply of essential goods in large cities and mining areas, but also pay more attention to arranging the supply of essential goods in rural areas. To do this work well, commercial administrative departments at all levels must uniformly lead state-owned commerce, cooperatives, and private commerce, refer to past experience in holiday supply work, uniformly formulate purchasing and sales plans, strengthen the organization of goods sources, and make timely transfers.

The directive put forward specific suggestions on how to supply the main materials such as meat, sugar, daily necessities and other non-staple foods needed by the people during the festival. The directive requires state-owned oil companies to sell all the edible oil that was not sold in October and November in December, and also to increase the amount of edible oil allocated to various provinces, and requires all regions to ensure that it is distributed to consumers before the festival.

    商业部指示各省市国营商业部门
    做好明年新年和春节必需物资的供应工作
    中华人民共和国商业部十一日发出指示，要求各省、市国营商业部门有组织和有计划地做好一九五五年新年和春节必需物资的供应工作。
    指示指出：明年的新年和春节不仅应继续重视和适当保证大城市工矿区的必需物资供应，更需要注意安排农村的必需物资供应。要做好这一工作，各级商业行政部门必需统一领导国营商业、合作社和私营商业，参照过去节期供应工作经验，统一制定购销计划，加强组织货源，及时调运。
    指示对节期人民需要的肉食、食糖、日用品和其他副食品等主要物资应如何供应，提出了具体意见。指示要求国营油脂公司除把十、十一两月未销完的食油加到十二月份全部售出外，还给各省增调一部分食油，并要求各地保证在节前分配给消费者。
