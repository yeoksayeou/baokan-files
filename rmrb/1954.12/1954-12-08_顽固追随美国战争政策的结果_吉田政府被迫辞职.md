    Stubbornly Following US War Policies Results in
    Yoshida Government Forced to Resign
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese cabinet, headed by Liberal Party Prime Minister Yoshida, was forced to resign en masse on the afternoon of the 7th, due to its inability to overcome opposition both inside and outside the Diet. At the same time, Yoshida also resigned from the presidency of the Liberal Party. Yoshida's forced resignation is the inevitable result of his government's persistent pursuit of US occupation and rearmament policies over the years. After returning from a recent visit to the United States, Yoshida had been trying to maintain the Liberal Party's ruling position and repeatedly threatened to dissolve the Diet. However, his pleas in Washington only intensified the wave of domestic opposition.
    On the 6th, the newly formed Japan Democratic Party, in conjunction with the left and right wings of the Socialist Party, submitted a motion of no confidence in the Yoshida cabinet to the House of Representatives, demanding the cabinet's immediate resignation. In stating the reasons for demanding the Yoshida cabinet's resignation, the motion of no confidence accused the Yoshida cabinet of "continuing to implement the evil policies of the occupation, adopting secret diplomatic policies externally, and adopting erroneous economic policies internally." The motion of no confidence also accused the Yoshida government of involvement in corruption and trampling on the spirit of the constitution.
    The day before, Japan's three major newspapers, "Mainichi Shimbun," "Asahi Shimbun," and "Yomiuri Shimbun," all published articles or editorials criticizing Yoshida and demanding his resignation. Their unanimous demand reflected the trend of Japanese public opinion. The motion of no confidence was originally scheduled to be put to a vote in the House of Representatives on the afternoon of the 7th. The Japan Democratic Party, together with the left and right wings of the Socialist Party, controlled more than 250 seats in the House of Representatives, exceeding the majority required to pass the motion. Because the passage of the motion of no confidence was a foregone conclusion, the Yoshida cabinet had to choose between resigning en masse or dissolving the Diet and holding a general election. The Yoshida cabinet and the leaders of the Liberal Party had been holding tense meetings for days to discuss countermeasures, but ultimately had to submit their resignation due to the pressure of the situation.

    顽固追随美国战争政策的结果
    吉田政府被迫辞职
    【新华社七日讯】东京消息：由于无法克服国会内外的反对，以自由党首相吉田为首的日本内阁已经在七日下午被迫实行总辞职。与此同时，吉田还辞去了自由党的总裁的职务。吉田的被迫辞职是他的政府几年来顽固地追随美国的占领和备战政策的立场的必然结果。吉田在新近访问美国归国后，还一直竭力想保持自由党的执政地位，并一再以解散国会作为威胁。但是他在华盛顿的乞求只是使国内反对浪潮更加高涨。
    在六日，新近组成的日本民主党联合了左、右两派社会党向国会众议院提出了对吉田内阁的不信任案，要求内阁立即辞职。不信任案在提出要求吉田内阁辞职的理由时，指责吉田内阁“继续推行占领下的恶政，对外采取秘密外交政策，对内则采取了错误的经济政策”。不信任案还指责吉田政府牵涉贪污事件并蹂躏宪法精神。
    在前一天，日本三大报纸“每日新闻”、“朝日新闻”和“读卖新闻”都发表文章或社论，指责吉田，要求他辞职。它们的一致表示的要求反映了日本舆论的趋势。不信任案原定在七日下午在众议院提付表决。日本民主党加上左、右两派社会党一共在众议院控制着二百五十多个议席，超过了为通过议案所必需的半数。由于不信任案的被通过已成定局，吉田内阁必须在总辞职或解散国会举行大选二者之中作一选择。吉田内阁和自由党的首脑们连日来曾紧张地举行会议商讨对策，但终究迫于形势而不得不提出辞职。
