Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 19th: Following the announcement of the US-Chiang treaty, Indian newspapers have successively published commentaries condemning this aggressive treaty.

    The "New Century" published an editorial on December 5th stating that the United States violated international agreements recognizing Taiwan as an integral part of China. The editorial said that American imperialists regard all these agreements as a pile of waste paper and violate any agreement that hinders them from achieving their imperialist goals. The editorial stated that interfering in the internal affairs of other countries has almost become a profession for American imperialists. Their Seventh Fleet is stationed in Chinese waters. Their planes intrude into Chinese airspace. American imperialists have been plotting to overthrow the government of the People's Republic of China. The editorial said that American rulers have no right to interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China from thousands of miles away. This action by the United States has deepened tensions in Southeast Asia.

    The "Freedom Daily" published an editorial on December 4th entitled "Down with the US-Chiang War Treaty," stating that the American rulers are devising all means to achieve their aggressive goals, and the new war treaty signed between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek is a despicable example. The editorial stated that the American rulers' practice of dragging Taiwan into their sinister embrace seriously violates even their own statements and promises. The editorial said that the US government deliberately chose this time to sign this war treaty hostile to China with Chiang Kai-shek. The Korean War and the Indochina War, despite the United States' strong opposition, have finally ended. Therefore, American warmongers have picked Taiwan as a new base for their new aggression and the launching of new wars. The editorial stated that the Five Principles announced by the Prime Ministers of China and India have won the sincere support of the world. By strengthening and expanding the friendship and cooperation between India and China, and by strengthening and expanding the peace zone, it will surely be possible to shatter the conspiracy of the American warmongers.

    The "Assam Tribune" published an editorial on December 8th stating that "From a linguistic, cultural, and geographical point of view, Taiwan is an integral part of China. The People's Republic of China's intention to liberate Taiwan is justified. The Chiang Kai-shek government is nothing more than a puppet manipulated by the United States, and it does not even represent a fraction of the vast Chinese people." The editorial condemned the United States, saying, "It is now very clear that the United States has only verbally respected the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of any country in the world. If this were not the case, why would the United States be so determined to form an alliance with him when the People's Republic of China intends to exercise its legitimate right to liberate Taiwan from the illegal occupation of the despised Chiang Kai-shek, who is now practically a bandit chief? Unfortunately, the American rulers, who have not seen the reality of the world situation, have not yet realized that China is a resolute country, and no threat, no matter how great, from any country or group of countries, can subdue them." The editorial said, "The rapidly developing situation surrounding the Taiwan issue not only seriously endangers the peace of China, but also the peace of Asia and the world."

    The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on December 10th stating, "To this day, there has been no argument put forward by the US State Department to refute Beijing's claim that Taiwan is an integral and inseverable part of Chinese territory. In fact, there is simply no argument to defend the attitude of the United States. Public opinion in other countries cannot regard as justified the open American protection of Taiwan and the islands adjacent to it." Commenting on Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," the editorial said, "The grave consequences so anxiously and solemnly suggested by Mr. Zhou Enlai threaten not only China alone but the whole of Asia, for whatever happens in China must inevitably affect its neighbors. The mutual defence treaty between Formosa [Taiwan] and Washington is a supplement to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation which is already causing uneasiness in many Asian countries."

    The "Jugantar" commented in its December 5th editorial on Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" that the Chinese Premier had expressed his opinion in terms that any national leader with self-respect would inevitably use. Mr. Zhou Enlai stated in the clearest terms China's attitude towards Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 19th: The Indonesian weekly "Sunday Courier" published a commentary on the 19th stating that only the firm unity of all peace-loving Asian people can overcome the situation in Asia caused by the US-Chiang treaty. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence agreed upon by the People's Republic of China, India, and Burma have laid the foundation for this unity. Expanding the scope of application of these Five Principles will become a torrent that extinguishes the flames ignited by American imperialism.

    The commentary pointed out that the United States and Chiang Kai-shek's conclusion of a so-called defense treaty is an attempt to legalize the US occupation of Taiwan, and the United States has violated the Potsdam Proclamation and the United Nations Charter it participated in signing. This is an act of direct interference in China's internal affairs.

    The commentary said that Dulles's claim that the US provocative attack on mainland China would not constitute a war exposed the US intention to launch a provocative attack on the People's Republic of China. The commentary said that people still remember that when Japan invaded Manchuria, it also claimed that it was not a war but a "punitive expedition." Every Asian can remember the result of that "punitive expedition" and still feels the pain of the unhealed wounds of war.

    The commentary said that in preparation for war, the United States sent spies into the territory of the People's Republic of China. Some of these American spies have been captured while engaging in espionage activities in China, and they themselves have admitted that they were sent to China by the US Central Intelligence Agency to carry out subversive activities. However, the United States claimed that these spies were prisoners of war and raised the issue at the United Nations. The commentary said that the United Nations has no right to interfere in this matter, because every country has the right to punish spies, and there is no provision in international law for the release of spies. The commentary pointed out that just as the Republic of Indonesia has full right to punish foreign spies, the People's Republic of China has full right to deal with any subversive activities.

    The commentary said that the United Nations' acceptance of the US request to discuss this issue is a disgrace to the United Nations. The commentary said that if issues are to be discussed in the United Nations, the first issue that should be discussed is the status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: Wellington news: The New Zealand "People's Voice" published a commentary on December 8th. The commentary said that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory, just as the Chatham Islands are part of New Zealand territory. The People's Republic of China believes that Taiwan must return to China, and this decision is justified. The commentary said that the US attempt to control Taiwan through the US-Chiang treaty is naked colonialism. The US-Chiang treaty is a war alliance against China. The commentary said that Taiwan has always been a base for Chiang Kai-shek's troops to conduct air raids, bombardments, send special agents, and intercept ships against China under the protection of the US Navy. It is only because of this action by the United States that there is tension in the Taiwan region.

### 印度、印度尼西亚、新西兰的报刊发表评论  谴责美蒋条约加深了东南亚紧张局势

    印度、印度尼西亚、新西兰的报刊发表评论
    谴责美蒋条约加深了东南亚紧张局势
    【新华社新德里十九日电】在美蒋条约公布之后，印度报纸陆续发表评论，谴责这个侵略性的条约。
      “新世纪报”十二月五日发表社论说，美国违反了承认台湾是中国的不可分割的一部分的国际协定。美帝国主义者把所有这些协定看作是一堆废纸，并且违反任何阻碍它达到它的帝国主义目标的协定。社论说，干涉别国的内政，差不多已成了美帝国主义者的一种职业。他们的第七舰队驻扎在中国的海面上。他们的飞机侵入中国领空。美帝国主义者一直在进行阴谋活动，企图推翻中华人民共和国政府。社论说，美国统治者无权到离美国几千英里的地方来干涉人民中国的内政。美国的这种行动加深了东南亚的紧张局势。
    “自由报”十二月四日以“打倒美蒋战争条约”为题发表社论说，美国的统治者们想出一切办法来达到他们的侵略目的，美国同蒋介石签订这个新的战争条约就是一个卑鄙的例子。社论说，美国的统治者们把台湾拖入他们罪恶的怀抱中去的这种做法，甚至也严重违反了他们本国的声明和诺言。社论说，美国政府故意挑选了这个时候和蒋介石签订这个敌视中国的战争条约。朝鲜战争和印度支那战争不顾美国极力反对终于结束了。因此，美国战争贩子们就挑上了台湾作为他们进行新的侵略和发动新的战争的新基地。社论说，中、印两国总理所宣布的五项原则已经赢得了全世界的衷心拥护。通过加强和扩大印度和中国之间的友谊和合作，通过加强和扩大和平地区，一定能够粉碎美国战争贩子的阴谋。
    “阿萨姆论坛报”十二月八日发表社论说，“从语言上、文化上和地理上来看，台湾都是中国的不可分割的一部分。中华人民共和国宣布解放台湾的意图，乃是理所当然的。蒋介石政府不过是美国操纵的傀儡，它甚至连广大中国人民的零头也代表不了。”社论谴责美国说，“现在看得很明显，美国一直只是在口头上尊重关于不干涉世界上任何国家内政的原则。如果不是这样，当人民中国打算行使它的合法权利，要把台湾从现在简直是盗匪头子的被唾弃的蒋介石的非法占领下解放出来的时候，为什么美国一心要同他结成联盟呢？不幸的是，没有看清世界现实局势的美国统治者们，竟然还没有认识到中国是一个坚决的国家，任何国家或任何国家的集团对他们发出任何多大的威胁，都是不能使他们屈服的。”社论说，“围绕台湾问题迅速发展的局势，不仅严重地危及中国的和平，而且也危及亚洲和全世界的和平。”
    “甘露市场报”十二月十日发表社论说，“至今为止，根本没有为美国国务院进行辩护而对北京的关于台湾是中国领土整体的不可分割的一部分的要求进行辩驳的言论。事实上，根本没有为美国的态度进行辩护的论据。其他国家的舆论都不能认为美国明目张胆地保护台湾及它邻近的岛屿的举动是正当的。”社论在谈到周恩来外交部长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明时说，“周恩来先生如此忧虑和郑重地提出的那种严重后果，不仅威胁着中国一国，而且威胁着整个亚洲，因为，无论中国发生些什么事，都必然会影响及它的邻国。台湾和华盛顿之间的共同防御条约是那个已经在许多亚洲国家内引起了不安的东南亚条约组织的补充。”
      “快乐市场报”在十二月五日的社论中评论周恩来外交部长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明说，中国总理已经用任何具有自尊心的国家领袖必然会采用的措辞表达了他的意见。周恩来先生以最明确的措辞表示了中国对台湾的态度。
    【新华社雅加达十九日电】印度尼西亚“星期日信使”周刊十九日发表评论说，只有一切爱好和平的亚洲人民坚决团结起来，才能克服美蒋条约所造成的危害亚洲的局势。中华人民共和国、印度和缅甸所一致同意的和平共处的五项原则已替这种团结打下了基础。扩大这五项原则的适用范围，就将成为一支扑灭美帝国主义所燃起的火焰的巨流。
    评论指出，美国和蒋介石缔结所谓防御条约是企图使美国占领台湾合法化，美国已经违反了它参加签订的波茨坦公告和联合国宪章。这是直接干涉中国内政的行为。
    评论说，杜勒斯曾声称，美国对中国大陆的挑衅性进攻并不会构成战争，这暴露了美国打算向中华人民共和国发动挑衅性进攻的意图。评论说，人们仍然记得，日本在侵略满洲时也曾声称那不是战争而是讨伐。每一个亚洲人都能记得那次讨伐的结果，并且对还未恢复的战争创伤仍感余痛。
    评论说，为了准备战争，美国派遣间谍到中华人民共和国境内去。这些美国间谍当中有些人在中国境内进行间谍活动时已被捕获，他们自己已承认，他们是被美国中央情报局派到中国去进行颠覆活动的。但是，美国竟说什么这些间谍是战俘，并把这个问题提到联合国。评论说，联合国无权干涉这个问题，因为每一个国家都有权惩办间谍，而国际法中也没有释放间谍的规定。评论指出，正如印度尼西亚共和国有充分权利惩办外国间谍一样，中华人民共和国有充分权利处理任何颠覆活动。
    评论说，联合国接受美国的要求讨论这个问题，是联合国的耻辱。评论说，如果要在联合国中讨论问题，首先应当讨论的就是中华人民共和国在联合国的地位问题。
    【新华社十九日讯】惠灵顿消息：新西兰“人民之声报”十二月八日发表评论。评论说，台湾是中国领土的一部分，正像查塔姆群岛是新西兰的领土的一部分一样。中华人民共和国认为，台湾必须重归中国，这个决定是正当的。评论说，美国企图通过美蒋条约控制台湾是赤裸裸的殖民主义。美蒋条约是一个针对中国的战争同盟。评论说，台湾一直是蒋介石军队在美国海军的保护下对中国进行空袭、炮轰、派遣特务和拦劫船只的基地。只是由于美国的这种行动，台湾地区才存在着紧张的局势。
