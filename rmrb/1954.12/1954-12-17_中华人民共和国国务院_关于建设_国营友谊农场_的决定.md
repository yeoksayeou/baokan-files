    Decision of the State Council of the People's Republic of China
    on the Construction of "State-owned Friendship Farm"
        (Passed by the State Council Standing Committee on December 7, 1954)
    The Soviet government delegation, representing the Soviet people, presented our country with the machinery and equipment necessary to organize a state-owned grain farm with 20,000 hectares of cultivated land, and sent a group of experts to help us establish this farm, so that we can learn the advanced experience of large-scale land reclamation and large-scale farm management in the shortest possible time. This is an important, huge, and friendly assistance from the Soviet Union to our country. In order to quickly establish this large-scale state-owned grain farm, the following decisions are made:
    1. This large-scale state-owned grain farm will be located in Sandao Gang, Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, and named "State-owned Friendship Farm" as a memorial to the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union.
    2. Wang Caoli is appointed as the director of "State-owned Friendship Farm," and a construction committee consisting of Wang Caoli, Wei Zhenwu, Zhang Shengsan, Chen Jianfei, Hong Shu, and Han Yu is established to be responsible for the farm's preparation work. The construction committee will work under the dual leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government.
    3. The "State-owned Friendship Farm" will mainly plant grains such as wheat, soybeans, and corn, based on local soil, climate, and other conditions, and gradually develop animal husbandry on the basis of developing grain production. It is required to complete the main basic construction projects of the farm and the reclamation of 20,000 hectares of wasteland within 1955.
    4. The central and Heilongjiang provincial water conservancy, transportation, railway, and other relevant departments should vigorously and actively support the construction of the "State-owned Friendship Farm." The Ministry of Agriculture and the construction committee should immediately and proactively contact the relevant departments.
    5. The construction committee should pay special attention to strengthening the political work of the farm, unite all employees, learn diligently from Soviet experts, strive to master new technologies and management methods of large-scale grain farms, and establish close ties with the residents around the farm, so as to play a due exemplary role in the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country.

    中华人民共和国国务院
    关于建设“国营友谊农场”的决定
        （一九五四年十二月七日国务院常务会议通过）
    苏联政府代表团代表苏联人民赠给我国以组织拥有两万公顷播种面积的国营谷物农场所必需的机器和设备，并派来一批专家帮助我们建立这个农场，使我们在最短期间内学会大量开垦荒地和经营大型农场的先进经验。这是苏联对我国一项重要的、巨大的、友谊的援助。为了迅速地建立这个大型国营谷物农场，特决定：
    一、这个大型国营谷物农场设在黑龙江省集贤县三道岗，命名为“国营友谊农场”，作为中苏伟大友谊的纪念。
    二、任命王操犁为“国营友谊农场”场长，并由王操犁、魏震五、张省三、陈剑飞、洪澍、韩玉等六人组成建场委员会，负责农场的筹建工作。建场委员会在农业部和黑龙江省人民政府的双重领导下进行工作。
    三、“国营友谊农场”根据当地土壤、气候等条件以种植小麦、大豆、苞米等谷物为主并在发展谷物生产的基础上逐步发展畜牧业。要求在一九五五年以内，完成农场的主要基本建设工程和两万公顷荒地的开垦任务。
    四、中央和黑龙江省的水利、交通、铁道以及其他有关部门应大力积极支援“国营友谊农场”的建场工作。农业部和建场委员会应即主动地和各有关部门取得联系。
    五、建场委员会应特别注意加强农场的政治工作，团结全体职工，勤勤恳恳地向苏联专家学习，努力掌握新的技术和大型谷物农场的管理方法，并和农场周围的居民群众建立密切联系，在我国农业的社会主义改造事业中，起应有的示范作用。
