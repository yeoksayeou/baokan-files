Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 11th: Sichuan Province, the largest grain-producing province in the country, has successfully completed this year's grain purchase plan. By December 4th, the amount of rice purchased and stored by the state had reached 106% of the original purchase plan. Some areas and a small number of surplus grain households that have not yet sold enough grain are continuing to sell their surplus grain to the state.

Beginning in late August, various parts of Sichuan Province began to prepare for grain purchases in a planned way. First, cadres were briefed on the policies related to unified purchase and sale, and the experiences and achievements of implementing unified purchase and sale of grain last year were summarized. Then, through various meetings and methods such as detailed accounting, the benefits of unified purchase and sale of grain were promoted to farmers. Local cultural propaganda departments also held picture and material exhibitions, using slides, blackboards, and other means to vigorously promote to farmers. On the basis of raising the socialist consciousness of cadres and the broad masses, a mass upsurge of "selling surplus grain and selling good grain" was formed throughout the province. In many places, when farmers sold surplus grain to the state, they put forward the slogan of "no good grain will leave the village," and automatically checked the quality of the grain.

Fifteen thousand party members in the Luzhou Special District implemented the party's class line in rural areas, relying on the poor peasants and uniting with the middle peasants, effectively smashing the illegal activities of certain landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries. The class consciousness of the peasants was raised, and they reported their actual yields and actively sold surplus grain. As of December 4th, the entire special district had overfulfilled the original grain purchase plan by 125%.

Eight thousand six hundred agricultural production cooperatives and more than forty thousand mutual aid groups in Sichuan Province played a leading role in the grain sales campaign. Most of the more than 600 agricultural production cooperatives established before the spring plowing set aside the best rice during the autumn harvest, dried it in the wind, winnowed it, and collectively sold the surplus grain to the state. The twenty-six agricultural production cooperatives in Nanxi County sold an average of more than 700 jin of grain to the state per household, more than double the amount sold to the state by ordinary farmers in the area. During the grain sales, driven by mutual aid and cooperation organizations, entire townships and villages collectively sold surplus grain.

In conjunction with the unified purchase of grain, various localities adopted the mass line method to determine the unified sales households and the unified sales volume, and issued unified sales certificates. The vast number of grain-deficient households in rural areas received a reasonable supply of grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 11th: A large amount of new grain from Sichuan Province is being shipped out steadily. In the grain purchase campaign, Wanxian, Jiangjin, Daxian, Yibin and other special districts, while purchasing grain, concentrated the new grain prepared for shipment to traffic lines such as the Yangtze River, Jialing River, Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and export points. In October and November, the amount of grain shipped out of the province exceeded twice the amount shipped out in the third quarter. The amount of grain planned to be shipped out in the fourth quarter of this year will be more than double that of the same period last year. Grain departments in various localities have made arrangements for the large-scale grain transfer work in the first quarter of next year.

Sichuan Province, the largest grain-producing province in the country, has had bumper harvests for years, and the amount of grain shipped out and the areas supplied have been expanding year by year. This year, the number of counties in the province responsible for shipping out grain has increased from more than fifty last year to ninety-three.

    四川省胜利完成今年粮食收购计划
    【新华社成都十一日电】全国产粮最多的四川省胜利完成今年粮食收购计划。到十二月四日止，全省统购入仓的大米到了原定收购计划的百分之一百零六。部分地区和少数尚未售足粮食的余粮户正在继续把余粮卖给国家。
    八月下旬起，四川省各地就开始有计划地准备收购粮食，首先向干部交代了有关统购统销的政策，总结去年实行粮食统购统销的经验和成绩。接着通过各种会议，采取算细账等方式，向农民宣传了粮食统购统销的好处。各地文化宣传部门也举办图片实物展览，利用幻灯、黑板报等大力向农民进行宣传。在提高干部和广大群众的社会主义觉悟基础上，全省形成了群众性的“卖余粮、卖好粮”的热潮。许多地方的农民向国家出卖余粮时，就提出了“不好粮不出村”的口号，自动检查粮食质量。
    泸州专区一万五千名党员，贯彻党在农村中的阶级路线，依靠贫农、团结中农，有力地粉碎了某些地主、富农和反革命分子的违法活动。农民阶级觉悟提高，纷纷报实产量，积极出售余粮。全专区到十二月四日止，已超额完成原定粮食收购计划百分之一百二十五。
    四川省八千六百个农业生产合作社和四万多个互助联组在售粮活动中起了带头作用。全省春耕前建立的六百多个农业生产合作社，大部在秋收时就把最好的稻谷放在一边，风干扬净，集体把余粮卖给国家。南溪县二十六个农业生产合作社平均每户卖给国家的粮食有七百多斤，超过当地一般农户卖给国家的粮食一倍以上。在售粮时，各地在互助合作组织带动下，整乡整村集体出售余粮。
    结合粮食统购，各地采取群众路线方法，确定统销户、统销量，发给统销证，农村广大缺粮户得到了合理的粮食供应。
     【新华社成都十一日电】四川省大批新粮源源外运。万县、江津、达县、宜宾等专区在粮食统购中，一面收购，一面把准备外运的新粮向长江、嘉陵江、成渝铁路等交通线和出口点集中。十、十一两个月内，全省运出的粮食已超过第三季度运出数量的一倍。今年第四季度计划外运的粮食比去年同时期增加两倍多。各地粮食部门对明年第一季度规模巨大的粮食外调工作，已作好安排。
    全国产粮最多的四川省连年丰收，外运粮食的数量和供应的地区都在逐年扩大。今年全省担任外运粮食的县份，已由去年的五十多个增加为九十三个。
