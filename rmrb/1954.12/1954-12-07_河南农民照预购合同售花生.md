    Henan Farmers Sell Peanuts According to Advance Purchase Contracts

    Henan Province has had a bumper peanut harvest this year, with the province producing over 240 million jin of peanuts, exceeding the original planned output by 20 percent. The advance peanut purchase program carried out in various regions this spring played a role in ensuring increased peanut production. After the peanut harvest, the broad masses of farmers actively sold peanuts according to the advance purchase contracts, returning their deposits. Farmers in Xiaodu Village, Neihuang County, paid off the 8,700 jin of peanuts pre-purchased by the state in one go, and returned 830,000 yuan in deposits. The Xuzhen Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Puyang County sent people to the countryside to purchase peanuts, and the farmers sold 4,600 jin of pre-purchased peanuts and 3,900 jin of peanut kernels in two days, and returned 22 million yuan in deposits. From late September to early November, supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the province have recovered 30,360,000 jin of pre-purchased peanut kernels and 2.4 billion yuan in deposits.

    河南农民照预购合同售花生
    河南省今年花生丰收，全省约产花生米二亿四千多万斤，超过原计划产量百分之二十。今年春天各地开展的花生预购工作，对保证花生增产起了一定作用。广大农民收获花生以后，积极按照预购合同，交售花生，归还定金。内黄县小杜村农民一次交清国家预购的八千七百斤花生，并归还了八十三万元定金。濮阳县徐镇供销合作社派人下乡收购花生，农民们两天就交售预购花生四千六百多斤、花生米三千九百多斤，并归还定金二千二百多万元。从九月下旬到十一月上旬，全省供销合作社已经收回预购的花生米三千零三十六万斤，收回定金二十四亿元。　（姚福年）
