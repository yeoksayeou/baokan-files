Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 9th: As of the morning of December 9th, the successor to the Yoshida Cabinet, which collapsed, is still proving difficult to produce. The special session of the Diet, originally scheduled to close on the 8th, has been extended to the 9th as a result.

The leaders of the Japan Democratic Party and the left and right-wing Socialist parties, who forced the resignation of the Yoshida Cabinet with a joint no-confidence motion, held three consecutive meetings on the 8th and the morning of the 9th to negotiate the nomination of a new prime minister. None of the three meetings reached an agreement, and negotiations will continue. News reports indicate that the focus of the dispute is on the issue of dissolving the Diet and holding general elections. The left and right-wing Socialist parties agreed to the Japan Democratic Party's request to support Ichiro Hatoyama, the president of the Japan Democratic Party, as prime minister to form a cabinet, but insisted that the new cabinet must be temporary and should dissolve the Diet and hold general elections in early next year. This condition has not been fully agreed to by the Japan Democratic Party.

On the 8th, left-wing Socialist Party members also held a meeting, deciding that dissolving the Diet and holding general elections should be the top priority at present. It is reported that many members are firmly advocating that Takeo Ogata, the current president of the Liberal Party and former Deputy Prime Minister of the Yoshida Cabinet, should not succeed as prime minister to form a Liberal Party cabinet.

While these parties are engaged in tense activities to select a new prime minister, Takeo Ogata formally succeeded Yoshida as the president of the Liberal Party on the 8th. In his inaugural address, Takeo Ogata emphasized that the Liberal Party should still become the "backbone of Japanese politics."

The continued chaos in the Japanese political situation has caused anxiety in Washington. Kyodo News reported that State Department officials in Washington fear that the next Japanese government may not last long, and that Japan may be in a state of political paralysis for a long time due to Yoshida's resignation. United Press reporter Hansley reported from Washington on the 8th: "American officials today still hope that Japan's two major conservative parties—the Liberal Party and the Japan Democratic Party—can unite and unanimously agree on a new prime minister to succeed Yoshida." Hansley also said: "Japanese business and financial groups are putting pressure on the Liberal Party and the Japan Democratic Party to eliminate their differences. Washington officials hope that this pressure will produce the desired effect."

    日本新首相很难产
    华盛顿对日本政局混乱表示不安
   【新华社九日讯】东京消息：截至九日上午为止，吉田内阁垮台后的继任首相仍在难产中。原定在八日闭幕的国会特别会议已因此延长到九日。
    以联合不信任案迫使吉田内阁辞职的日本民主党和左、右两派社会党的领导人在八日和九日上午连续举行了三次会议，谈判新首相的提名问题。三次会议都没有取得协议，谈判还将继续进行。消息报道：争执的焦点是在解散国会举行大选的问题上。左、右两派社会党同意日本民主党的要求，支持日本民主党的总裁鸠山一郎为首相组织内阁，但是坚持新内阁必须是临时性的，应当在明年年初解散国会举行大选。这个条件没有得到日本民主党的完全同意。
    八日，左派社会党议员也举行了会议，决定以解散国会举行大选为当前首项目标。据报道，许多议员都坚决主张不让现任自由党总裁、前吉田内阁副首相绪方竹虎继任首相再组织自由党的内阁。
    在这些党派正在为新首相人选而紧张活动的时候，绪方竹虎在八日正式接替吉田就任了自由党的总裁。绪方竹虎在就职演说中，强调自由党仍然要成为“日本政治的骨干”。
    日本政局的继续混乱引起了华盛顿的不安。共同社报道：华盛顿的国务院人士担心下届日本政府寿命可能不会长，担心由于吉田的辞职，日本可能长期处于政治瘫痪状态。合众社记者汉斯莱八日自华盛顿报道：“美国官员们今天仍然希望日本的两大保守党派——自由党和日本民主党——能联合起来，并且一致同意由一位新首相继承吉田。”汉斯莱还说：“日本企业和金融集团正在对自由党和日本民主党施加压力，以促使他们消除他们的分歧。华盛顿官方人士希望这种压力将能产生预期的效果。”
