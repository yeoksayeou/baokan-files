    The Zhengzhou area is rich in wheat, cotton, oil crops, tobacco, and medicinal herbs, possessing excellent conditions for developing light industry. To meet the needs of new industrial development, a new, fully automated thermal power plant was built in Zhengzhou last year with strong assistance from the Soviet Union.

    When Zhengzhou was liberated in 1948, the power plant had only one 15-horsepower diesel generator, producing enough electricity for only one or two hundred light bulbs. During the brief period of economic recovery, although the installed capacity of Zhengzhou's power industry increased rapidly, the city's electricity demand exceeded the power plant's maximum generation capacity by about 10% before the new power plant was built.

    Since the completion of the new power plant, the city's power equipment capacity has tripled, overcoming the original power shortage. It has met the power needs of existing textile machinery, machinery repair, cotton textile, flour, and oil pressing industries, and also provides a large amount of electricity to various factories and construction sites that have been built or are under construction. Comparing September of this year with September of last year, the city's new industrial electricity users increased by 100, and industrial electricity consumption more than doubled.

    Sufficient power supply has also promoted the development of the city's handicraft production cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics, 21 handicraft production cooperatives in Zhengzhou have installed nearly 100 horsepower of electric motors. These cooperatives, which have switched to machine and electric power production, have seen rapid production development, increased incomes for their members, and accumulated large amounts of public funds. Educated by these facts, many individual handicraft workers are contemplating organizing cooperatives.

    The urban area's lighting electricity has also obtained a sufficient power supply. From October of last year to September of this year, the number of lighting electricity users in Zhengzhou increased by 541, and lighting electricity consumption increased by 40.26%.

    Sufficient power supply has also guaranteed the development of public utilities. In the past, Zhengzhou was a water-scarce city with very few sweet water wells providing potable water. With the completion of the Zhengzhou Power Plant, Zhengzhou also built a tap water plant using electric pumping this year. Another larger-scale electric tap water plant is under construction; once completed, it will guarantee the city's industrial and residential water needs. In addition, over the past year, more than 390 new street lights have been installed, ten times the number in the entire city at the time of liberation.

    From October of last year to September of this year, the Zhengzhou Power Plant erected more than 37 kilometers of high-voltage lines and more than 24 kilometers of low-voltage lines. Nearly 20 kilometers of high-voltage lines were replaced with new wires, and a new large-scale substation was built, and the original substation was expanded. The Zhengzhou-Xingyang high-voltage line currently under construction will extend the power plant's power supply area to neighboring areas dozens of kilometers away.

    Over the past year, the Zhengzhou Power Plant's power supply has more than doubled, and it is estimated that next year's power supply will increase significantly compared to now. To meet the new needs, a new power plant expansion plan has already begun to be drafted.

    To introduce the Zhengzhou Power Plant, it is also necessary to introduce the growth of its technical strength.

    There are not many old workers in the Zhengzhou Power Plant. Many people did not even know what "electricity" was a year and a half or two years ago. Quan Kejian, who is learning to operate the condensers, used to make hemp ropes. Gao Pengfei, who does chemical water analysis, was originally a tailor along the Xiangjiang River. Yang Xiuzhen, the young girl on duty in the central control room, used to be a shoemaker. After coming to the power plant, they went through a difficult learning phase and are now able to independently operate new and complex machinery and equipment. Even some of the old workers had never seen such a new type of power plant. The factory organized them to intern in the Northeast, and their technical level has also improved significantly after returning to the factory.

    There is an old guerrilla fighter named Zhao Huanan, who was assigned by the Party to work at the power plant. He was assigned to be the director of the chemical branch. Zhao Huanan immediately collapsed into his chair laughing: "Ask me, a roughneck, to do chemistry! I, who never even entered the door of elementary school, to do chemistry!" However, he did not lose heart because of this. He studied hard from morning till night, and also led the workers in the entire branch to study technology. Zhao Huanan had many teachers: Soviet experts, technicians, old workers; he learned from whoever knew. Now he is basically competent in his job.

    When the power plant first started operating last year, the production situation was very poor, and many inexplicable accidents occurred continuously: the person pulling the switch pulled the wrong one, the person wiping the machine wiped the cloth into the machine, the vacuum dropped to zero and they didn't know to reduce the load, and they forgot to add air when adding coal... There were 14 major power outages in two months. But now, the boiler branch's accident-free record has approached 300 days; the accident-free record of Chen Zhenlie's team in the turbine branch has reached 348 days; the plant's coal consumption rate and plant electricity consumption rate have repeatedly created new lows.

    Over the past year, 69 workers at the Zhengzhou Power Plant have been promoted, 45 apprentices have been promoted to workers, 190 apprentices have been upgraded, and 27 technicians and intern technicians have been upgraded.

    一年来的郑州电厂
    左改
    郑州市附近，盛产小麦、棉花、油料、烟叶和药材，具备发展轻工业的各项优越条件。为了适应新的工业发展的需要，去年，在苏联的大力援助下，郑州市建成了一座新型的全部自动化的火力发电厂。
    一九四八年郑州市解放时，电厂只有一部十五匹马力的柴油发电机，发出来的电只够一、两百盏电灯照明用。经济恢复时期的短短几年中，郑州市电力工业的设备容量虽然增加很快，但在新电厂未建成以前，全市需要用电量比当时的电厂最高发电量还超出百分之十左右。
    新电厂建成以后，全市电力设备容量比过去增加了三倍，克服了原有的缺电现象，满足了原有的纺织机械业、机械修配业、棉纺织业、面粉业、榨油业等工业生产的动力需要，也大量地供应着已经建设成的和正在建设中的各个工厂、工地的用电。拿今年九月份和去年九月份比较，全市新的工业用电户增加了一百户；工业用电量增加了一倍多。
    充裕的电力供应，也促进了全市手工业生产合作事业的发展。据不完全统计，郑州市已有二十一个手工业生产合作社安装了近百匹马力的电动机。这些改用机器和电力生产的合作社，生产发展很快，社员收入也随之提高，并且积累了大量的公积金。在事实的教育下，很多个体手工业者，正酝酿着组织合作社。
    市区照明用电也获得了充足的电力供应。从去年十月到今年九月的一年中，全郑州市的照明用电户增加五百四十一户，照明用电量增加百分之四十
  一点二六。
    充足的电力供应也保证了公用事业的发展。过去郑州市是缺水的城市，能供饮用的甜水井很少。随着郑州电厂的建成，郑州市今年也建成了使用电力抽水的自来水厂。另一座更大规模的电力自来水厂正在施工；它建成以后，可保证全市工业用水和市民用水的需要。此外，一年来新安装路灯三百九十多盏，为解放时全市路灯的十倍。
    从去年十月到今年九月，郑州电厂架设了三十七公里多的高压线路和二十四公里多的低压线路，将近二十公里的高压线路换设了新电线，还新建了一座大型的变电站和扩建了原来的变电站。目前正在架设的郑州荥阳高压线路建成以后，就将使电厂的供电区域扩展到数十公里外的邻境。
    一年来郑州电厂的供电量已经增加了一倍以上，预计明年的供电量还要比现在增加很多。为了适应新的需要，一个新的电厂扩建计划已经开始着手起草了。
    要介绍郑州电厂，还必须介绍技术力量增长的情况。
    郑州发电厂的老工人并不多，很多人在一年半或两年前，甚至连什么是“电”都不懂得。站在凝结器旁边的学工权克俭，过去是搓麻绳的。做化学水化验工作的高鹏飞，原先是湘江沿岸的一个裁缝。在总机室值班的小女孩杨秀珍，过去是一名做鞋女工。他们到发电厂后，经过艰苦的学习阶段，现在已能单独操纵新式的复杂的机器设备了。就是一些老工人，过去也没有见过这样新型的电厂。工厂曾组织他们到东北去实习，回厂后技术水平也有显著提高。
    有一位老游击队员赵化南，党分派他到电厂工作。他被分配担任化学分场主任。赵化南接着命令就笑倒在椅子上：“叫我这大老粗搞化学！过去一天小学门也没进过的人来搞化学！”可是，他并没有因此而灰心。他起早歇晚地自己学习，并且还领导全分场工人学习技术。赵化南的师傅多得很，苏联专家、技术员、老工人；谁懂得他就向谁学。现在他已基本上能胜任自己的工作了。
    去年电厂刚开始运转的时候，生产情况很不好，许多莫名其妙的事故不断出现：拉开关的人把开关拉错了，擦机器的人把布擦到机器里去了，真空降到零还不知道减负荷，加煤时忘了加风……两个月就出现了十四次重大停电事故。但现在，锅炉分场全分场的无事故纪录已经接近三百天了；汽机分场陈振烈班的无事故纪录已经达到三百四十八天；全厂的煤耗率厂用电率一再创造最低新纪录。
      一年来郑州电厂工人升级的有六十九人，学徒升工人的有四十五人，学徒升级的有一百九十人，技术员和实习技术员升级的有二十七人。
