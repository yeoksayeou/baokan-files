    This year, during the rapeseed sowing season, most provinces in the south experienced drought, late harvesting of autumn crops, and insufficient fertilizer, resulting in generally rough sowing practices. After emergence, pest infestations were widespread in many areas, leading to significant rapeseed seedling shortages. Therefore, guiding farmers to strengthen field management of rapeseed to increase yield per unit area has become an urgent task.
    The primary task in rapeseed field management is timely thinning and checking for missing seedlings, transplanting seedlings from thinnings to fill gaps. Farmers in Wenjiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, traditionally thin seedlings when they have two or three true leaves, while simultaneously checking and filling gaps, and then setting the seedlings. They have consistently achieved high yields with this method, which is worth considering for other regions. After setting the seedlings, rapeseed should be top-dressed with fertilizer. Particularly in areas where sowing was later than usual, applying wood ash, grass clippings, and winter irrigation helps to retain heat and prevent frost. Top-dressing in early spring is crucial for increasing rapeseed yield. In 1954, farmers in Yishan County, Guangxi Province, significantly increased yields by more than 150% compared to 1953 by applying additional top-dressing during the seedling setting and bolting stages. Some farms in Sichuan Province have also seen significant yield increases by top-dressing during the initial flowering period. Mobilizing the masses to accumulate and produce fertilizer, and fully exploring fertilizer sources, is an important measure to ensure increased rapeseed production.
    Currently, aphids, flea beetles, cabbage worms, and other pests are emerging in rapeseed fields across various regions, with particularly severe infestations in Yunnan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and other provinces. Timely inspection and control measures are essential. In Malong County, Yunnan, after rapeseed pests appeared, the county mobilized farmers to eradicate them in phases and zones, and the seedlings are growing well.
    To strive for increased rapeseed production, local authorities should guide farmers in adopting technical measures such as pollination and topping. Rapeseed is a cross-pollinating crop, and incomplete pollination affects yield. Integrating apiculture with diversified operations of agricultural production cooperatives can increase pollination opportunities. Topping rapeseed can promote branching and make the seeds fuller. Farmers in Tongren Prefecture, Guizhou Province, top the main stem tips of rapeseed during bolting and apply appropriate amounts of top-dressing. This not only increases rapeseed yield, but also allows the heart stems to be eaten or sold, increasing income. This method can be appropriately promoted and extended in areas where the soil is fertile and rapeseed grows vigorously.

    Doing a good job in wheat field management is a major task in current rural production. This winter, the weather has been relatively warm, and wheat seedlings may grow excessively. Recently, in Mi County, Gong County, and six other counties in Henan Province, early-sown crops have shown serious signs of excessive growth, with some even beginning to head. Wheat seedlings in Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, are also growing excessively. If these seedlings are hit by a cold wave, they are very susceptible to frost damage and death. All regions must learn from historical lessons of warm winters followed by cold springs, take early measures, and strengthen frost prevention efforts. On drylands in the north, rolling the soil before it freezes can suppress excessive seedling growth, close soil gaps and surface cracks, ensure close contact between roots and soil, and prevent ventilation and frost damage. In clay soils with high water content, if rolling before freezing is not possible, it can be done after freezing. For excessively growing seedlings, harrowing or light harrowing can be used to inflict a certain degree of mechanical damage, suppressing excessive growth. In southern wheat fields, dry, loose pond mud or river mud can be added, and soil clods can be broken with wooden rollers to mound around the wheat roots to prevent frost damage. For seedlings that have already jointed, in areas where the absolute minimum winter temperature is below -5 to -10 degrees Celsius, there is a risk of frost death. The upper part can be cut off to promote the growth of new tillers; early cutting is advisable to avoid excessive consumption of nutrients; cut 10 to 12 centimeters above the ground to avoid damaging tillers that have not jointed; after cutting, pay attention to applying more phosphorus and potassium fertilizer.
    This summer, there was a lot of rain, and fertilizer accumulation in various regions was insufficient. After the campaign for exceeding production targets was launched, most of the fertilizer was used as top-dressing for autumn fields, and the base fertilizer for wheat fields was generally reduced compared to previous years. For example, in Leling County, Dezhou Prefecture, Shandong Province, more than 550,000 mu of wheat were planted, of which more than 200,000 mu were planted on bare land. In the eleven counties of Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, the area of wheat fields fertilized was lower than last year. In southern wheat fields, even fewer base fertilizers were applied. All regions must conscientiously mobilize the masses, urgently accumulate fertilizer, and increase top-dressing to compensate for the lack of base fertilizer. Human urine is the best top-dressing for wheat fields. Experiments and investigations in Shandong and Henan provinces have shown that applying 1,000 to 1,500 jin of urine per mu can increase production by 10% to 20%. Many regions do not utilize this resource. According to estimates in Henan Province, 15 billion jin of urine fertilizer can be collected annually. If two-thirds of it is lost, it is equivalent to a loss of more than 200 million jin of ammonium sulfate in fertilizer effectiveness.
    Irrigation is an important measure to increase wheat production in the north, but many people in some areas lack the habit of irrigating wheat. In Shaanxi, Gansu, and other places, there is even a saying that "irrigating in summer yields no grain." All regions in the north must vigorously mobilize the masses, fully utilize existing water conservancy conditions, and actively develop water sources to expand the area of irrigated wheat. Timely irrigation of seedlings damaged by frost can also reduce losses. Southern wheat fields should emphasize drainage, especially in low-lying areas and rice fields with high soil clay content. Deep ditches and high ridges should be made, as farmers say, "Wheat is harvested every year, but only lazy people don't dig ditches," and "High ridges and deep ditches, others won't harvest, but I will." Farmers in southern Jiangsu Province use the winter slack season to "clear wheat ditches," which not only clears ditches, drains water, and prevents siltation, but also evenly distributes ditch soil on the ridge surface, playing a role in soil mounding and frost prevention.

    加强油菜、小麦的田间管理工作
    农业部粮食生产总局
    今年油菜播种时期，南方各省大部缺雨，晚秋作物收获又迟，加以肥料不足，播种工作普遍粗放；出苗后不少地区虫害又普遍发生，油菜缺苗现象严重。因此，领导农民加强油菜田间管理，以提高单位面积产量，就成为一件迫切的工作。
    油菜的田间管理，首先是及时进行间苗和查苗补苗，利用间苗移栽来补足缺苗。四川省温江专区农民通常习惯在幼苗开始发出二、三个真叶时，即进行间苗，同时查苗补缺，然后定苗，历年都获得较高产量，这一经验值得各地参考。油菜定苗后，应随即追肥。特别是比常年播种晚的地区，应追施草木灰、盖草屑及冬前灌水等，以保温防寒。早春追肥对提高油菜产量关系很大。一九五四年广西省宜山县农民由于在定苗及抽苔期间增施追肥，获得大面积丰收，每亩比一九五三年增产一倍半以上。四川省有些农场在初花期追肥，增产也很显著。发动群众积肥造肥，充分发掘肥源，以便适时施用，是保证油菜增产的重要措施。
    目前各地油菜的蚜虫、猿叶虫、菜青虫等相继发生，云南、湖北、江西、浙江等省更为严重，必须及时进行检查防治。云南马龙县在油菜发生害虫后，发动农民分期分区及时扑灭，幼苗生长良好。
    为争取油菜增产，各地应领导农民采用授粉、摘心等技术措施。油菜为异花授粉作物，授粉不全，影响产量，可结合农业生产合作社的多种经营，提倡养蜂，以增进授粉机会。油菜摘心可促进分枝，使籽粒饱满。贵州省铜仁专区农民，在油菜抽苔时，打去主茎顶尖，并适量追肥，不但增加菜籽产量，心苔且可食用或出售，增加了收益。在土壤肥沃油菜生长茂盛的情况下，这种办法可适当提倡推广。

    做好麦田管理工作，是当前农村生产中的一件大事。今年入冬以后，气候比较温暖，麦苗有旺长可能。最近河南省密县、巩县等八县播种较早的作物，已发现严重的徒长现象，且有孕穗的情况。河北省邯郸专区亦有麦苗生长过旺现象。这种麦苗如遇寒流袭击，极易冻伤死亡。各地必须吸取冬暖春寒的历史教训，及早采取措施，加强防冻工作。北方旱地上冻前可进行镇压，抑止麦苗发旺，堵塞土壤空隙及地面裂缝，使麦根和土壤密接，防止透风受冻。含水较多的粘土地在冻前不能镇压时，可在上冻以后再行镇压。对徒长的麦苗，可用反耙或轻耱的办法，使麦苗受到一定程度的机械损伤，抑止徒长。南方麦田可以用加盖干松塘泥、河泥和用木磙打碎土块，培壅麦根等办法，以防止冻害。对已拔节的麦苗，在冬季绝对最低温度低于摄氏零下五度到十度的地区，有冻死可能时，可以割去上部，以利于新生分蘖的生长；早割为宜，以免过多消耗养分；要在离地面十到十二公分处割掉，不要损伤没有拔节的分蘖；割后并要注意适当多施磷钾质肥料。
    今年夏季雨水多，各地积肥多不充足；开展超额增产运动后，大部肥料都用作秋田追肥，麦田基肥一般都较往年减少。如山东省德州专区乐陵县种麦五十五万余亩，其中有二十万余亩白地下种，河南新乡专区十一个县麦田施肥面积都低于去年。南方麦田不施基肥的更多。各地必须认真动员群众，抓紧积肥，增施追肥，以补基肥的不足。人尿是麦田最好的追肥，山东、河南两省的试验和调查，每亩浇尿一千至一千五百斤，可增产百分之十到二十。很多地区不加利用，据河南省估计全年可有尿肥一百五十亿斤，若以损失三分之二计算，相当于损失二亿多斤硫铵的肥效。
    进行灌溉是北方小麦增产的重要措施之一，但不少地区群众缺乏浇麦习惯，陕西、甘肃等地群众甚至有“浇夏无粮”的说法。北方各地必须大力发动群众，充分利用现有水利条件，并积极开辟水源，扩大浇麦面积。遭受霜害的青苗及时浇水也可减轻损失。南方麦田则要重视排水工作，特别是在地势较低及土壤黏性大的水稻田，更应作到深沟高畦，农民有“小麦年年收，只怕懒汉不开沟”，“高畦深沟，人家不收我家收”的说法。苏南一带农民利用冬闲“撩麦沟”的办法，不但可清沟排水防止淤塞，并且利用沟土均匀分布畦面，发挥培土防冻的作用。
