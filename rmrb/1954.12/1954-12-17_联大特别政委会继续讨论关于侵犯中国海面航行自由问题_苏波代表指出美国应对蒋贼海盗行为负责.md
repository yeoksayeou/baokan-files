(Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 15th) According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly Special Political Committee continued its discussion on the afternoon of December 13th regarding the issue of infringing upon freedom of navigation in Chinese waters.

    Polish representative Skrzeszewski pointed out that the piratical activities of Chiang Kai-shek elements under the protection of the United States have created a serious situation in the Far East. Chiang Kai-shek elements hijacked two Polish merchant ships and inhumanly treated the detained crew members. The Polish representative cited irrefutable evidence proving that the United States Air Force and Navy should be held responsible for the piratical acts of Chiang Kai-shek elements in Chinese waters. The Polish people protest this illegal seizure of merchant ships in Chinese waters. The United Nations General Assembly should take measures to ensure the release of all merchant ships and their crews detained by Chiang Kai-shek elements.

    The U.S. representative was unable to refute any of the facts presented by the Soviet and Polish representatives in his speech. As usual in such situations, the U.S. representative, unable to produce arguments to defend his case, said that bringing this issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion was for "propaganda purposes." The U.S. representative avoided the substance of the issue and simply slandered the People's Republic of China, Poland, and the Soviet Union.

    British representative, Mr. Pink, spoke, trying his best to defend the actions of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang under its protection. Like the U.S. representative, he also attempted to deny the participation of U.S. aircraft in the attacks by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on merchant ships sailing in Chinese waters, but he could not provide any arguments to support his claim.

    Ukrainian representative Palamarchuk said that the piratical acts infringing upon the freedom of navigation on the high seas undermine the most basic principles of international law and hinder the development of international trade and economic relations. He cited facts to prove that not only the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang but also the United States, which incites and supports them, should be held responsible for the piratical acts in Chinese waters. The United Nations General Assembly should resolutely condemn such acts.

    The Norwegian and Turkish representatives, pretending not to know that the U.S. fleet participated in the piratical acts in Chinese waters, stated that they would vote against the Soviet proposal.

    Soviet representative Malik spoke, refuting the U.S. representative's argument that the Soviet Union raised this issue for "propaganda purposes." Malik pointed out that the Soviet Union raised this issue not only in consideration of the Soviet sailors and the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" hijacked by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, but also in consideration of the dozens of merchant ships of various countries attacked by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the suffering of many sailors on these ships. He said that we have the right to insist that the United Nations take measures to stop this crime that undermines recognized principles of international law. Whoever calls raising this issue propaganda is not seriously discussing the issue but engaging in slander.

    Malik then said that the British and Norwegian representatives attempted to cast doubt on the responsibility of the U.S. Navy for the piratical acts in the Far East. However, the doubt they spread has been dispelled by the U.S. representative himself, who said that the U.S. Navy was "patrolling" in the aforementioned area.

    Malik pointed out the strange attitude taken by the British representative. Although the British representative said that Britain has always advocated the principle of freedom of navigation for centuries, he is unwilling to condemn the violations of this principle in Chinese waters. The British representative even spoke as if the responsibility for the piratical attacks should not be borne by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, but by the People's Republic of China. This statement by the British representative is surprising.

    Malik said that the Soviet delegation firmly believes that the United Nations General Assembly should take measures to stop the piratical acts in Chinese waters, because these acts have become a threat to peace and security in the Far East and the world.

    联大特别政委会继续讨论关于侵犯中国海面航行自由问题
    苏波代表指出美国应对蒋贼海盗行为负责
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约十五日讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会十三日下午会议继续讨论关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由问题。
    波兰代表斯克热歇夫斯基指出，蒋介石分子在美国庇护下进行的海盗活动，已经在远东造成了严重的局势。蒋介石分子劫夺了两艘波兰商船，并且惨无人道地对待被拘禁的船员。波兰代表举出无可辩驳的证据，说明美国空军和海军应当对蒋介石分子在中国海面的海盗行为负责。波兰人民抗议这种在中国海面非法劫夺商船的行动。联合国大会应当采取措施，使一切被蒋介石分子扣留的商船和它们的船员获得释放。
    美国代表在发言中无法推翻苏联和波兰代表举出的任何一个事实。和往常遇到这种情况一样，美国代表因为提不出论据来辩解，就说，把这个问题提到联合国大会讨论是为了达到“宣传的目的”。美国代表撇开问题的实质不谈，而只是对中华人民共和国、波兰和苏联进行诽谤。
    英国代表平克发言，竭力为美国和在美国庇护下的蒋介石匪帮的行为辩解。和美国代表一样，他也企图否认美国飞机参加了蒋介石匪帮对航行在中国海面的商船的袭击活动，但是他拿不出任何一个论据来支持他的说法。
    乌克兰代表帕拉马尔楚克说，侵犯公海上航行自由的海盗行为破坏了国际法的最基本的准则，阻碍国际贸易和经济关系的开展。他举出事实证明，应该对在中国海面上的海盗行为负责的不仅是蒋介石匪帮，而且还有怂恿和支持他们的美国。联合国大会应当坚决谴责这种行为。
    挪威和土耳其代表装作不知道美国舰队参加了中国海面上的海盗行为，他们表示将投票反对苏联提案。
    苏联代表马立克发言，驳斥了美国代表所谓苏联提出这个问题是为了“宣传的目的”的论调。马立克指出，苏联提出这个问题，不仅是考虑到被蒋介石匪帮劫夺的苏联海员和苏联油船“图阿普斯号”，而且考虑到受到蒋介石匪帮袭击的各国好几十艘商船，考虑到这些船只上许多海员的痛苦。他说，我们有权利坚持要求联合国采取措施来制止这种破坏公认的国际法准则的罪行。谁把提出这个问题叫做宣传，谁就不是认真地讨论问题而是进行诽谤。
    马立克接着说，英国和挪威代表企图使人怀疑美国海军对在远东发生的海盗行为应负的责任。但是，他们散播的这种怀疑已经被美国代表自己打消了，美国代表说，美国海军是在上述地区“巡逻”。
    马立克指出英国代表所采取的奇怪的态度。英国代表虽然说，英国几世纪以来就一直主张航海自由原则，然而，他却不愿斥责在中国海面对这个原则的破坏行动。英国代表并且说得好像海盗式袭击的罪责不应由蒋介石匪帮来负，而应由中华人民共和国来负。英国代表这种说法使人觉得很出奇。
    马立克说，苏联代表团坚决主张，联合国大会应采取措施来制止在中国海面的海盗行为，因为这种行为已经成为对远东和世界和平和安全的威胁。
