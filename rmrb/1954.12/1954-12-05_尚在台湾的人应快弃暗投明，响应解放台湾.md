    Those Still in Taiwan Should Abandon Darkness and Embrace the Light, Responding to the Liberation of Taiwan
    Weng Wenhao
  　I am Weng Wenhao. I once joined the reactionary group headed by Chiang Kai-shek for more than ten years. Serving as a high official in the puppet regime was a grave crime against the people. By the time I resolved to turn over a new leaf, it was already too late. But since I was determined, I would certainly break through the obstruction of the traitorous bandits and return to the motherland as a criminal awaiting punishment. After returning to the country, I was deeply moved by the people's magnanimity and tolerance, not holding my past against me, and allowing me to reform and renew myself. I felt even more strongly that the people's government had opened up a path of reform and progress for all compatriots across the country, thus further increasing everyone's responsibility to abandon darkness and embrace the light, and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. In recent years, I have personally witnessed the brilliance of democratic politics in the motherland, the significant improvement of people's lives, the unprecedented enhancement of international status, and the complete breaking of imperialist exploitation. I truly feel like I have been resurrected, and I am filled with joy and excitement. In this state of mind, I think that only Taiwan and its surrounding islands in the national territory are still occupied by the Chiang bandits, and have not been liberated. There are still a few people around Chiang who are helping him collude with the US to sell out the country. Among these few people, some are my former acquaintances and friends. I cannot help but quickly advise these people to quickly understand the overall situation, distinguish between right and wrong, respond to the liberation of Taiwan, and return to the embrace of the motherland.
    Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are an inseparable part of China's territory. This is a universally recognized and unquestionable fact. Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor whom the 600 million people of the country jointly despise. He occupies Taiwan, colludes with American imperialism, harasses the motherland, and even goes so far as to sign a joint defense treaty with the US, showing the ultimate extent of his treachery, and greatly increasing his crimes against the motherland and the people. The people of the whole country demand the liberation of Taiwan in order to realize our territorial integrity, to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous acts, and to eliminate American imperialism's aggression. Therefore, liberating Taiwan is our current sacred task. Those who can contribute are performing meritorious service, and those who obstruct are guilty. Those still in Taiwan must quickly recognize this and must never be used by Chiang Kai-shek again. In fact, the joint declaration of the democratic parties and people's organizations has already indicated the way out for those who fled to Taiwan with Chiang, saying that except for Chiang himself, anyone is allowed to abandon darkness and embrace the light, perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, and their past will not be held against them. This is a concrete statement of the lenient policy. Even someone like me, who held high positions under Chiang Kai-shek and was listed as a war criminal, can still receive the forgiveness and preferential treatment of the people of the motherland once I repent and return to the country to plead guilty. Why are you still hesitating and waiting?
    The hopes of those who are still eking out a precarious existence under the puppet regime in Taiwan are nothing more than two. One is that Taiwan still has some production capacity, such as the annual production of hundreds of thousands of tons of sugar, which can be exploited and plundered; the other is reliance on the so-called assistance of American imperialism. In fact, it should be known that Taiwan's industry was all created by the former Japanese colonial policy. At that time, Japan, as the suzerain state, exploited Taiwan as an affiliated territory. Taiwan does not produce the basic materials it needs, such as steel, machinery, and crude oil, and must rely on the suzerain state for support and supply; the quantity of sugar, alkali, cement, gasoline, etc. produced in Taiwan far exceeds Taiwan's sales volume, and it has to be fully supplied for the suzerain state's control and utilization. At that time, the Japanese regime used this method to control Taiwan, so that the Taiwanese people, although they had patriotic enthusiasm, were actually unable to break away from Japan. If Taiwan is liberated, then the Taiwanese people will all be compatriots of our country, in the same country, and the production and supply of each province should help each other, share what they have and need, and become one. People's China is developing industrial production, and if Taiwan returns to the motherland, they will work together and advance together, and be as inseparable as milk and water, which would naturally be the most correct situation. On the contrary, if Taiwan is still occupied by Chiang Kai-shek and depends on the US, then Taiwan will inevitably be annexed by the US. The so-called assistance of the US is actually to aid the traitorous regime, and is intended solely for the interests of the US itself. After Japan surrendered and Taiwan was recovered, I remember very well that the US tried every means to dump American petroleum products into Taiwan. The US also used Cuban sugar produced with American capital to compete for Taiwan's sugar market at a lower price, making our sales difficult. Can this be called assistance? Now, Chiang Kai-shek kowtows and surrenders to the US and obeys its orders, but the US still thinks it is not enough and goes a step further, wanting to have many American electric power, chemical, petroleum, aluminum manufacturing and other specialized companies invest and take power in Taiwan, reversing the roles of guest and host, and enjoying monopoly profits before it feels relieved. This is clearly the capital export of imperialism, restoring the old state of the Japanese rule. Do you still believe it is assistance? Those who remain in Taiwan are in this situation, and they are really suffering from it, and it should be easy to understand. The facts are obvious. Is there still a possibility of turning enemies into friends? Therefore, the current question for everyone in Taiwan is, are you willing to be slaves of imperialism? Or do you want to restore the sovereignty of the motherland? You must choose one of these two paths as soon as possible, and you can no longer delay.
    It can be seen from this that if people in Taiwan continue to stay under Chiang Kai-shek, they will inevitably join in the traitorous activities. They must quickly wake up and get out of their迷途, so that they can turn to a new path. I imagine from afar that they also have a conscience, and when they ask themselves at night, they must also feel pain. The reason why they have been dragging on until now and hesitating is probably because they are misled by the following kinds of psychology. One is that they clearly know right and wrong, and know that selling out the country is a great crime and that Chiang Kai-shek will inevitably be defeated, but because of the feudal era's blind loyalty, they mistakenly think that things have come to this point and it has been too long, so they have to follow to the end and leave their fate to God. This is an absolutely absurd view that goes against the trend of the times. Helping to sell out the country is tantamount to willingly being a traitor. Since they can recognize the crime of selling out the country, they must never indulge in it and refuse to change, willingly increasing their sins, being slaves of Chiang Kai-shek, and failing to fulfill their heavy responsibility to the people of the motherland. Another is that they clearly know that American imperialism is the enemy and Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor, and they really want to turn around and see the mountains and rivers of the motherland again, but they have been deceived by the US and Chiang Kai-shek and fear that the Chinese people will pursue their past crimes, so they dare not come. There seem to be many people who have mistakenly heard rumors. These people should be able to thoroughly understand after reading the joint declaration clearly announced by the democratic parties and people's organizations, and quickly make a determination to abandon darkness and embrace the light and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. You must know that you are only accomplices, not principals. As long as you rise up to respond to the liberation of Taiwan and perform meritorious service for the country, the people will surely be lenient and understanding, and will welcome you. Once you think about the above psychology, you should immediately wake up and understand everything. Another is that their knowledge is really too low, and they are really completely deceived, and right and wrong are reversed. They mistakenly believe that American imperialism is a friendly country and Chiang Kai-shek is a holy ruler, and that liberation is a disaster. Therefore, they want to rely on the庇荫 of the US and Chiang Kai-shek. I don't think there will be many people who hold this kind of extremely absurd and hopeless view. It is only up to them to willingly perish.
    Chiang Kai-shek's evil deeds are too numerous to count, and he has betrayed the motherland. The 600 million people of the country are jointly condemning him, and he will soon be destroyed. What we are hoping for now is that other people who are still hesitating and waiting will make a decisive decision as soon as possible, break away from the shackles of the US and Chiang Kai-shek, and no longer help the wicked do evil and be accomplices. At this point in time, those who sell out the country will be defeated, those who betray the country will perish, those who perform meritorious service can atone for their crimes, and those who reform can renew themselves. The deeper their love for the country, the harder they should fight against the thieves. The more fiercely they oppose Chiang Kai-shek, the higher their meritorious service will be. Justice is clear, and there is no room for hesitation or waiting. The people and the People's Liberation Army on the mainland are setting goals and strengthening their efforts. The compatriots in Taiwan have always been enthusiastic and patriotic, and will surely respond with one heart. The few people who fled to Taiwan with Chiang have no reason to still be obsessed and refuse to return. Although it is too late to turn back today, there is still this last and best opportunity, and you must not miss it again. Therefore, I am willing to shout at the top of my voice to awaken the rapid awakening of those few people.
    Compatriots who are still in Taiwan! The motherland has issued a sacred call to liberate Taiwan! The door of the motherland is open to you! Let's rise up, let's perform meritorious service!

    尚在台湾的人应快弃暗投明，响应解放台湾
    翁文灏
  　我是翁文灏，我从前曾加入蒋介石为首的反动集团十多年，在伪政权做大官就是对人民负重罪。等到我决心改过自新，为时实已太晚。但我既具决心，自必打破卖国匪徒的阻挠，以待罪之身回到祖国。回国以后，深得人民宽大相待，不究既往，允予自拔更新，更感觉人民政权为全国同胞宏开革新前进的道路，因此更加重了大家弃暗投明立功赎罪的责任。这几年来，我在祖国亲见民主政治焕发光明，人民生活显著改善，国际地位空前提高，帝国主义的压榨完全打破，真觉得起死回生，欢欣鼓舞。在这种心情下，我想到全国领土中只有台湾各岛还被蒋贼割据，未得解放，蒋贼左右还有少数人帮他联美卖国，这少数人中还有一部分是我的旧识旧友，我不能不赶紧劝告这些人快速看明大局，分别是非，响应解放台湾，回到祖国的怀抱。
    台湾和澎湖各岛是中国不可分割的领土，这是全世界所共认而无可置疑的事实。蒋贼是全国六亿人民所共同唾弃的叛逆。他盘踞台湾，勾引美帝国主义，侵扰祖国，更进而与美帝签订共同防御条约，极卖国的大观，万分加重了他对祖国对人民的罪孽。全国人民要求解放台湾，以实现我们的领土完整，以消灭蒋贼的卖国行为，以打消美帝国主义的侵略。所以解放台湾是我们当前的神圣任务，能有贡献的便是立功，要加阻挠的便是有罪。尚在台湾的人必须迅速认清，万不可再为蒋贼利用。其实各民主党派各人民团体联合宣言已对随蒋逃往台湾的人指示出路，说是除蒋一人之外，任何人都容许弃暗投明，立功赎罪，既往不究。这是宽大政策的具体声明。像我这样曾在蒋贼部下历居高位，且曾列名于战争罪犯的人，一旦悔悟，回国请罪，尚能得到祖国人民的宽宥与优容，你们还用徘徊观望吗？
    目前还在台湾伪朝廷下苟延残喘的人所抱希望不外两个。一是台湾尚有若干生产能力，如同年产食糖几十万吨之类，可以有所剥削搜括；二是依赖美帝国主义的所谓援助。其实要知道台湾工业都是从前日本殖民政治所造成的。那时日本以宗主国的地位来榨取附属地的台湾。台湾所需要的钢铁机器原油等基本物资，台湾都没有生产，必须依赖宗主国来支持供给；台湾所出产的糖，碱，水泥，汽油等等，其数量远超过于台湾的销路，而不得不充分供宗主国的支配与利用。那时日本政权是用这种手段来控制住台湾，使台湾人民虽有爱国热诚，而实际上无法脱离日本。台湾如果得到解放，则台湾人民都是本国同胞，同在一个国家，各省生产供应正应互相帮助，有无相通，成为一体。人民中国正在发扬工业生产，台湾回到祖国，提携共进，水乳交融，自为最正确的景况。相反的，台湾如仍被蒋贼割据，依赖美帝，则台湾势必为美帝所并吞。美帝所谓援助实际上是接济卖国政权，专为美帝自身利益打算。从前日本投降台湾收复之后，我很记得美帝的作为是千方百计要用美国石油产品向台湾倾销。美国又用美资出产的古巴糖跌价争夺台湾糖的市场，使我们销路为难。这可称为援助吗？现在呢，蒋贼向美帝屈膝投降，唯命是听，但美帝还以为不足，更进一步，要使好些美国的电业，化工，石油，制铝等专业公司到台湾投资掌权，反客为主，享受垄断利益，方才放心。这明是帝国主义的资本输出，回复了从前日本统治时代的旧状。难道你们还信为是援助吗？这种情况，留在台湾的人身临其境，实在也是身受其痛，应该是容易明白的，事实昭然，还有化敌为友的可能吗？因此，在台湾诸人目前问题，是甘心供帝国主义的奴役呢？还是要回复祖国的主权？这两条路中必须从早选定一条，不可再迟了。
    从此可见，在台湾诸人如果继续留在蒋贼手下，势必要加入卖国的勾当，必须快速觉悟，自拔迷途，才能转到自新的道路。我遥为推想，他们也有人心，清夜自问，一定也有感到痛苦的。所以拖延到今，迟疑不决者，我想当为下列几种心理所误。一种是明识是非曲直，知道卖国是大罪，蒋贼必败亡，但因封建时代的愚忠，误谓事已到此，为时已久，只好相随到底，祸福听之天命，这是违背时势绝对荒谬的见解。帮同卖国便是甘做叛逆。既能认识卖国的罪恶，决不应沉溺不改，自甘加重罪孽，做蒋贼的奴隶，而亏负了对祖国人民的重责。再一种是明知美帝是仇敌，蒋贼是叛逆，很想回头重见祖国山河，只是受了美蒋欺骗、惧怕中国人民追究前罪，因而避不敢来。这种误听谣言的人像是为数很多。这些人读了各民主党派各人民团体明白宣布的联合宣言，应可彻底明了，快速立定弃暗投明与立功赎罪的决心了。须知你们只是胁从，并非主犯，只要起来响应解放台湾，为国立功，人民自必宽为谅解，且加欢迎的。以上心理，一经细想，都应立可觉悟，豁然贯通。又一种则是知识实在太低，果真全受欺蒙，是非颠倒，误信美帝是友邦，蒋贼是圣主，解放则是灾难，因而想托美蒋的庇荫；抱有这种极端荒唐无可救药的人我想决不会多，那是只好听他们自甘灭亡的了。
    蒋贼恶贯满盈，背叛祖国，全国六亿人民同声讨伐，不久必归消灭。现在所盼望的是尚在徘徊观望的其他人物，快些当机立断，脱离美蒋的牢笼，不再助纣为虐和为虎作伥。时到今日，卖国者必败，叛国者必亡，立功可以赎罪，改过才能自新，爱国愈深便应击贼愈力，反蒋愈烈便是立功愈高，正义昭然，万无可以迟回观望的余地。大陆上人民和解放军正在悬定目标，加强努力，台湾本地同胞向来热诚爱国，定能同心响应，随蒋逃往台湾的少数人们决没有理由还是沉迷不返。尽管今日回头为时已晚，究竟还有这个最后而极好的机会，切不可再为错过。因此，我愿力竭声嘶，来唤起那少数人的迅速觉悟。
    尚留台湾的同胞们！祖国已发出神圣解放台湾的呼声了，祖国的大门向你们敞开着，大家起来吧，大家立功吧！
