As the climate began to turn cold, the People's Governments in the heavily affected areas of Jiangsu Province, considering that the temporary shelters built by disaster victims were no longer suitable, promptly issued loans and relief grains and funds, and supplied wood and other materials to support the disaster victims in building houses. As of early December, according to statistics from seven counties including Gaochun, Huaiyin, Baoying, Lishui, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, and Liuhe, disaster victims had repaired more than 78,800 houses, and more than 11,000 disaster-stricken households had moved into new houses. Generally, 70% of the houses have been built in each heavily affected county, and about 90% have been repaired in counties such as Lishui. Currently, disaster victims are moving into new houses one after another.

    江苏重灾区灾民搬进新居
    当气候开始转寒的时候，江苏省各重灾地区的人民政府，考虑到灾民们临时搭盖的一些棚户已不适用，及时发放了贷款和救济粮款，供给了木料等，以支持灾民修建房屋。到十二月上旬止，据高淳、淮阴、宝应、溧水、高邮、江都、六合等七个县统计，灾民已修好了七万八千八百多间房屋，另外还有一万一千多户灾民住进新屋。各重灾县一般都已盖好了百分之七十的房屋，溧水等县已修好百分之九十左右。目前，灾民们正陆续搬进新屋。
