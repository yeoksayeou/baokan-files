    Constantly Breaking Through Weak Links
    ——A Method of Ensuring and Supervising Production by the Second Workshop Branch of the CCP Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant

    Concentrating forces to break through weak links in production, raising backward areas to advanced levels, and ensuring balanced production is an excellent method employed by the Second Workshop Branch of the CCP Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant to guarantee the completion of production tasks.
    In January 1954, the production of the Second Workshop experienced extremely imbalanced conditions. The three work sections exhibited three different situations. At that time, the production tasks of the Second Work Section were completed very smoothly, with surplus figures constantly increasing; the Third Work Section generally could also complete its tasks; however, the situation in the First Work Section was very poor, with the rejection rate constantly rising. The rejection rate of eight types of products even reached 30 to 50 percent, resulting in a large number of products being returned for repair and severely affecting the production schedule. A large number of semi-finished products were backlogged in the First Work Section, which also affected the production of the other two work sections and even the entire factory. This presented the workshop branch with a serious task. In order to reverse the serious situation of production imbalance, the branch learned about the situation from many aspects and traced the root causes of the problems. Branch committee members participated in administrative production report meetings, as well as various meetings of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, to listen to feedback. Several work section leaders kept shouting at the meetings:
    "The workers in the First Work Section have backward thinking." The branch talked to the work section leaders and production team leaders, and they still emphasized that the workers had backward thinking and were not enthusiastic about production. The branch secretary went to the workshop to observe, and saw the work section leaders running back and forth between the lathes, inspecting the workers' production, sweating profusely; many workers, however, were not in a hurry, and some were even chattering with the work section leaders, not following instructions. From these situations, it seemed that the opinions of the work section leaders were correct. However, the branch committee did not draw a conclusion just like that. They brought these situations to the group leader meetings of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League for everyone to study and discuss, and also took advantage of production gaps to talk to the workers and listen to their opinions. When the workers heard the branch secretary mention the problems existing in production, they complained a lot, saying: "Is there any way to do this job?" Worker Guan Changlin said: "The work section leaders are all wearing 'phoenix coronets and robes of rank,' not knowing who the real boss is (meaning whose words count)!" Based on this situation, the branch secretary convened a meeting of activists, mobilizing them to expose the problems existing in the work section. It turned out that the problem lay with the work section leaders. The three work section leaders of this work section did not carry out production according to a unified production plan, but divided all the products that should be produced in the work section into three equal parts according to variety. Whoever failed to complete their assigned task was responsible. As a result, a parochialist mentality arose among these work section leaders, each taking care of their own business. For example, when the work section leader of the first shift was on duty, he would ask the workers to work on the types of products he was responsible for. After the work section leaders of the second and third shifts took over, they would ask the workers to work on the products they were responsible for. Because of such frequent changes of work, work hours were wasted on unloading and clamping, which affected the workers' ability to complete their quotas, and the workers had complaints about the work section leaders. Some people suggested that the work section leaders improve the operation plan and strengthen the connection between the three shifts; the work section leaders, however, objected: "Do whatever I tell you to do. Those who do not follow the orders of the work section leader will be fired!" The workers had no place to voice their grievances. Some workers grumbled in secret: "The work section leader's mouth is the operation plan." Some workers saw that making suggestions was ineffective, so they developed a "broken pot, broken shatter" mentality and wanted to find a way to get out of the First Work Section. After grasping these situations, the branch committee held a meeting, comprehensively and specifically analyzed the situation, and believed that the key lay in improving the leadership methods and work style of the work section leaders in order to strengthen plan management. In order to solve this problem, the branch took various measures. The branch first brought the three work section leaders together, held an ideological meeting, and mutually examined and criticized their tendencies toward decentralism. The branch committee also submitted this issue to the February general meeting of Party members for discussion. At the general meeting of Party members, everyone criticized the decentralism of the three work section leaders and their patriarchal leadership style, so that the cadres and workers reached a unified understanding. The general meeting of Party members also made a resolution: strengthen the management of the work section, improve the operation plan, and instruct the workshop director (a Party member) to implement this resolution. After the meeting, under the leadership of the workshop director, a unified operation plan was made; the leadership style of the work section leaders also began to change. The branch concentrated its efforts on ideological education for the workers, which increased the workers' enthusiasm for work and sense of responsibility. The workers actively tried to improve tools and improve product quality. Worker Hou Baolin improved the automatic capping machine, which not only increased production efficiency by 30 percent but also reduced the physical labor of the workers. Gao Yuxiang changed to using a tool post cap to increase production by more than double while also ensuring quality. The workers' creativity continued to emerge, and the production situation slowly became normal, with intermittent work hours greatly reduced. The administrative leadership also promptly promoted the Shilov drilling method, which solved some technical problems in production. In February, the First Work Section completed 103.5 percent of the plan and ensured quality. In the past eight months (up to the end of September), the work section has continuously solved the quality problems of more than 30 kinds of products. Since May, it has overfulfilled the national plan every month, and has won the Red Banner of Excellence three times in a row in the labor competition.
    The production situation in the First Work Section improved rapidly and achieved balance with the production in the Second Work Section. Relatively speaking, the Third Work Section appeared to be lagging behind. The equilibrium rate of workshop production decreased day by day. With the emergence of new situations, the branch's attention gradually focused on the Third Work Section. After some investigation and research, the branch found that the main problem preventing the Third Work Section from increasing production was that the milling workers could not keep up with the production needs. There were two reasons for this: first, there were not enough tools, and some workers lacked an overall concept, and in order to complete their personal quotas, they hid the completed tools and refused to exchange them with others; the other reason was that there were many tasks, few milling workers, and low technical levels. In response to these reasons, the branch first convened a meeting of Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres to study how to break through the weak links in the Third Work Section. At the meeting, everyone believed that a labor competition focusing on technological innovation should be carried out to mobilize and organize workers to improve tools and find ways for lathe workers to replace milling workers in production. In the competition, the branch educated the workers to promote the spirit of unity and fraternity, help each other improve their skills, and exchange tools for use. The branch also vigorously publicized Wang Chonglun's innovative spirit of improving tools and replacing milling workers with planing workers, and mobilized lathe workers to improve tools and replace milling workers in production. At the same time, the administrative leaders of the workshop promptly put forward key topics. The branch mobilized workers to grab topics through organizations such as the trade union and the Communist Youth League. After a series of work, the lathe workers' enthusiasm for creativity was stimulated. In less than a month, five lathe workers, including Li Shourang, Pan Guoxiang, and Tan Shousheng, improved 14 kinds of tools, replacing milling workers to manufacture 14 kinds of products, and reducing the rejection rate. For example, the 501 chuck body was milled by milling workers for a week without producing a qualified product. After the lathe worker improved the bayonet fixture, he could produce eight qualified products every day. In this way, the milling production force of the Third Work Section caught up with the needs of the First and Second Work Sections, and production basically achieved balance.
    Due to the relatively smooth production in the Second Work Section in the past few months, complacency has emerged among some cadres and workers. The branch discovered this situation and reminded everyone in the October general meeting of Party members to pay attention to preventing and overcoming arrogance and complacency.

    不断地突破薄弱环节
    ——记中共齐齐哈尔第二机床厂二车间支部保证和监督生产的一个方法
    马义
    集中力量突破生产中的薄弱环节，把落后部分提高到先进水平，保证生产均衡的进行，这是中共齐齐哈尔第二机床制造厂二车间支部保证完成生产任务的一个很好的方法。
    一九五四年一月，二车间的生产出现了极不平衡的现象，三个工段的生产是三种情况。当时第二工段生产任务完成的很顺利，超额数字不断增大；第三工段一般的也能完成任务；第一工段的情况却很坏，废品率不断上升，有八种产品的废品率竟达百分之三十到五十，产品大量回修，严重地影响生产进度；大批的在制品积压在一工段，也影响了其他两个工段以至全厂的生产。这给车间支部提出了严重任务。为了扭转生产不平衡的严重局面，支部从多方面了解情况，追寻发生问题的根源。支部委员参加了行政的生产汇报会，以及工会和青年团的各种会议听取反映。几个工段长在会议上一直喊：
  “一工段工人思想落后”。支部找工段长、生产组长谈话，他们还是强调工人思想落后，生产不积极。支部书记到车间去观察，只见工段长串着车床来回跑着检查工人的生产，忙得满头大汗；许多工人却不慌不忙的，有的还和工段长叽叽咕咕，不听指挥。从这些情况看工段长的意见似乎是正确的。但是支部委员会没有就这样下结论。他们把这些情况拿到党、行政、工会和青年团的小组长会议上让大家研究讨论，并抓紧生产空隙时间找工人谈话，听取工人的意见。工人们听到支部书记提到生产中存在的问题，就大发牢骚说：“这个活还有法子干？”工人关长林说：“工段长都带‘凤冠霞帔’不知谁是正宫娘娘（谁说的话算数的意思）！”根据这个情况，支部书记召开了积极分子会议，动员他们揭发工段内存在的问题。原来毛病出在工段长的身上。这个工段三个领班的工段长没有按着统一的生产计划进行生产，而是把工段中应该生产的全部产品按品种平均分成三份，谁完不成自己所分的一份任务，谁负责。结果在这些领班的工段长中就产生了各顾各的本位主义思想。譬如：第一班领班的工段长值班时叫工人干他所分担的生产品种，第二班和第三班的领班工段长接班后，又叫工人干他们所分担的产品。由于这样经常换活，工时都浪费到卸活、卡活上了，因而影响工人完不成定额，工人对工段长便有了意见。有人建议工段长改进作业计划，加强三班联系；工段长却反对：“我叫干啥就干啥。不执行工段长命令就开除！”工人有苦无处诉。有些工人就在背地发牢骚：“工段长的嘴就是作业计划。”有些工人看见提意见不起作用，就产生了破罐子破摔的思想，想设法混出一工段。掌握了这些情况之后，支部委员会开会，全面的具体的分析了情况，认为关键在于改进工段长的领导方法和工作作风，以加强计划管理。为了解决这个问题支部采取了各种措施。支部首先把三个工段长找到一起，开了个思想见面会，互相检查、批判了分散主义思想。支委会又把这个问题提交二月份的党员大会讨论，在党员大会上，大家批评了三个工段长的分散主义思想和家长制的领导作风，使干部和工人取得了一致的认识。党员大会并且作出决议：加强工段的管理工作，改进作业计划，责成车间主任（党员）执行这个决议。会后，在车间主任的领导下作出了统一的作业计划；工段长的领导作风也开始转变了。支部集中力量对工人进行了思想教育，提高了工人的劳动积极性和责任感。工人们主动地想法改进工具，提高产品质量。工人侯宝林改进了自动套扣器，不但提高生产效率百分之三十，还减轻了工人的体力劳动。高玉祥改用刀架套扣提高生产一倍多还保证了质量。工人中的创造不断出现，生产情况慢慢正常起来，间断工时大大减少。行政领导方面也及时推广了希洛夫钻孔法，解决了生产中的某些技术问题。二月份第一工段完成计划百分之一百零三点五，并保证了质量。八个月来（至九月末），工段里连续解决了三十多种产品质量问题，自五月以后，月月超额完成国家计划，在劳动竞赛中连续获得了三次优胜红旗。
    第一工段的生产情况迅速好转，和第二工段的生产取得了平衡，相对的第三工段便显得落后了。车间生产的均衡率又一天天地降低下来。随着新情况的出现，支部的注意力逐渐地集中到第三工段上来了。经过一番调查研究以后，支部发现了第三工段生产提不高的主要问题是铣工跟不上生产需要。原因有二：一是工具不够用，有些工人又缺乏整体观念，为了个人完成定额，使完工具藏起来，不肯和别人交换使用；另一个原因是任务多，铣工人数少，技术水平低。针对这些原因，支部首先召集了党、行政、工会、青年团干部在一起开会，研究如何突破第三工段的薄弱环节。会上大家认为应该开展以技术革新为内容的劳动竞赛，动员、组织工人改进工具，设法由车工代替铣工生产。竞赛中，支部教育工人发挥团结友爱精神，互相帮助提高技术，互相交换使用工具。支部并大力宣传了王崇伦改进工具，以刨工代替铣工的革新精神，动员车工改进工具，代替铣工生产。与此同时，车间行政领导方面及时提出关键课题。支部通过工会、青年团等组织动员工人抢课题，经过一系列的工作，车工的创造积极性被激发起来，不到一个月的工夫，就有李守让、潘国祥、谭寿生等五名车工改进了十四种工具，代替铣工制造了十四种产品，并减低了废品率。如五零一卡盘体铣工干了一个星期，没出一个合格品，车工改进了湾板胎具后，每天都能生产八个合格品。这样，第三工段的铣工生产力量赶上了一、二工段的需要，生产基本上达到了平衡。
    第二工段由于几个月来生产比较顺利，在某些干部和工人当中又出现了自满情绪。支部发现了这种情况，在十月份的党员大会上已经提醒大家注意防止和克服骄傲自满情绪了。
