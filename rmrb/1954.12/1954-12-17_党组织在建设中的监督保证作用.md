    The Supervisory and Guaranteing Role of Party Organizations in Construction
    Yang Zhifan, First Deputy Secretary of the CPC Yumen Oil Mine Committee

    Over the five years since liberation, the Party organizations of the Yumen Oil Mine have demonstrated a strong supervisory and guaranteeing role in the restoration, transformation, and development of the oil mine's production.

    In the autumn of 1949, thanks to the rapid advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Yumen Oil Mine returned completely to the embrace of the people. At that time, the Party first actively carried out Party building work among the workers and masses, focusing on training outstanding workers in communist ideology and the Party through training classes, and absorbing those with high levels of awareness into the Party. Later, the Party continued to develop new Party members in a series of democratic reforms, production reforms, and labor competitions, paying attention to educating them on Party member self-cultivation.

    Under the Party's continuous education, Communist Party members have fully played an exemplary and core role in the various construction tasks of the Yumen Oil Mine. In the 1952 mine-wide labor model selection, Party members accounted for 31 percent, rising to 38 percent in 1953. Currently, the Communist Party members, who account for about 15 percent of the mine's employees, have become the backbone of various work posts.

    The heroic deeds of Communist Party members in production are too numerous to mention. Once, at a certain well near the top of the oilfield, a natural accident occurred with a sudden rupture of the wellhead oil pipe, causing a serious blowout, with oil and gas spraying out violently. Standing six or seven meters away from the well was dangerous enough to cause fainting. However, if the blowout was not stopped quickly, the self-spraying capacity of other wells could be damaged as a result, resulting in unimaginable colossal losses. At this time, Communist Party members Liu Zhanhu and other comrades rushed to the oil well, risking the violent impact of oil and gas, carefully searching for the cause of the blowout, stubbornly persisting in their work until they fainted from the oil and gas fumes. Inspired by the tenacious spirit of the Communist Party members, the workers persisted in two days and nights of heroic struggle, finally stopping the blowout and restoring the oil well to normal.

    With the rapid development of work and the inability to supply technical cadres and skilled workers from outside the mine, a serious task facing the Yumen Oil Mine Party organization was to cultivate a large number of technical and management cadres from practical work to meet the needs of the work. Over the past five years, we have planned and run more than 200 various cadre training classes at the global and grassroots levels, including those for Party, government, labor union, and youth league cadres. Leading units have formulated training plans for reserve cadres in each production and functional organization, adopting methods such as signing mutual assistance contracts, apprenticeship contracts, self-study plans, and assigning dedicated teachers to carry out training, so that we have reserve leadership forces in various production posts. The Party organization also uses encouragement, praise, criticism, and self-criticism, and holds experience exchange meetings to care for and help cadres' progress and improvement at any time. As a result, the original technical and management cadres have improved their working abilities, and new technical forces have also grown. The number of drillers, drivers, and drilling workers newly trained in drilling work is more than twenty times that of the early days of liberation. 1,017 cadres were promoted, including 114 workers from the Yumen Mining Bureau who were promoted to cadres above the workshop level (excluding those who were transferred out). In order to support the work in other petroleum industrial areas, 905 skilled workers and cadres have been transferred out. Without the growth of a large number of cadres, it would not be possible to cope with the constantly developing situation.

    Uniting and educating technical personnel is a key issue in the Party's leadership of enterprise production. The Yumen Oil Mine is a concentration of petroleum industrial technical cadres, making this work particularly important. We have carried out ideological remolding of technical cadres in conjunction with the central work of each period. The Party uses regular individual talks or heart-to-heart meetings to understand their difficulties and requirements, and strives to guide and enlighten them, patiently and sincerely helping them to recognize the correctness of the Party's policies and clarify the view of serving the people with technology. The Party organization often encourages technical personnel to go deep into workshops and construction sites, so that they can enrich their practical experience in on-site work and gain opportunities for self-education. In addition, the Party organization consciously uses typical facts to educate them. Once, a technician, because he did not adopt the workers' opinions, designed the expansion design of the diesel cold pressing plant behind closed doors, causing 18 rework wastes during the construction process. The Party organization suggested that the administration use this as a typical case for handling, which educated himself and everyone. He Zhenpeng, a specialized engineer in the refinery, used to only believe in himself and look down on the masses. The Party branch secretary encouraged him to discuss matters with the workers more often. He has repeatedly studied with the workers and masses, and has truly realized the wisdom of the masses in practice and improved his awareness. Once, when a liquid ammonia pipe in the cold pressing plant ruptured, he risked suffocation to rescue it, and was praised by the factory's employees. He and the workers and masses jointly studied and proposed changing the mixing ratio of solvent oil and heavy lubricating oil, breaking through American technical standards, and creating a value of more than 520 million yuan for the country in one year. Because he gradually realized the greatness and correctness of the Party, and after his active application and participation in the "Basic Knowledge Training Class for Party Members," the Party finally accepted him as a Communist Party member in June 1952.

    Now, the vast majority of the technical cadres of the Yumen Oil Mine are working diligently, and are striving to learn business, learn politics, learn Russian, and learn advanced Soviet experience. Due to the improvement of their political awareness, the number of people applying to join the Party has increased year by year. After the Party's investigation, 34 people who meet the standards of Communist Party members have been admitted to the Party.

    To further exert the Party's supervisory and guaranteeing role in production, it is necessary to combine political work and economic work, so that the Party's political and ideological work permeates various economic tasks. Our approach in the past few years has been: First, we require Party organizations at all levels to be familiar with the production plan, then earnestly organize the workers and masses to discuss the plan, and check the implementation of the plan. If problems are found in the implementation of the plan, we immediately help to solve them.

    The Party actively and enthusiastically supports the various correct initiatives of the workers and makes them play their due role in production. In the second half of 1951, in order to increase gasoline production on the basis of saving crude oil consumption, the Party organization put forward the call of "increasing the gasoline refining rate." Many workers actively looked for tricks and potential around this topic. Dai Yuru, a member of the Communist Youth League, proposed adding a secondary evaporation tower to the cracking plant to re-evaporate the fuel oil at low pressure to increase the refining rate, but it was resisted and snubbed by conservative thinking. Dai Yuru's proposal was shelved in the archives for a full three months. The Party organization discovered this situation and immediately organized relevant personnel to conduct research, identified the significant value of this proposal, and criticized various erroneous understandings and styles. The administration issued an order to immediately design and construct it, and set a deadline for completion. The Party branch encouraged Dai Yuru to further research, and mobilized the workers to solve the specific problems in the additional construction. After eight valuable supplementary suggestions were put forward by advanced technical workers around this proposal, and many experiments were carried out, the addition of the secondary evaporation tower was finally successfully tested in May 1952, increasing the gasoline refining rate by 8% to 10%, which could increase the country's wealth by more than 1.04 billion yuan in one year.

    The suggestions of Soviet experts are many of the fundamental issues in the construction of the Yumen Oil Mine, and have played a decisive role in the development of the Yumen Oil Mine. All the employees of the mine call the expert's help "first-class technology, sincere heart". However, the suggestions of experts were not deeply understood and valued by all comrades at the beginning, but were realized after a long period of exploration and effort. In implementing the suggestions of experts, the Party's guaranteeing and supervising role occupies an extremely important position. For example, repairing "abandoned wells" is one of the important suggestions made by experts for oil production work. At first, many people were unconvinced, thinking that "repairing abandoned wells takes time and money, cures deafness and becomes dumb, and has little potential." After the leadership's repeated insistence, the Party committee secretary personally attended the well repair team meeting, requiring "guaranteed oil production." The Party branch convened a meeting of old technicians to study solutions to specific difficulties in well repair work, and mobilized Party members to take the lead in the work. Communist Party member Liu Gongzhi found the law of controlling blowouts and brought the enthusiasm and wisdom of the masses into play, so that the experts' suggestions were implemented creatively. In the first year, five "abandoned wells" were repaired, and the output increased by 130 million yuan in the same year. Up to now, eleven "abandoned wells" of various types have been repaired, which is unprecedented in the Yumen Oil Mine.

    The realization of each suggestion will lead to new changes in equipment, operation, management system, etc. In the face of new changes, many new difficulties and new obstacles will arise. Therefore, in practical work, the Party organization uses meticulous ideological and organizational work to overcome people's old habits and influences.

    Mobilizing the workers and masses to carry out labor competitions is the main method to complete the state plan and improve labor productivity. In order to lead the labor competition to normalcy and persistence, the Party supervised the administration and the trade union to carefully sign and conscientiously fulfill the collective contract, making it the action program of all employees.

    In order to realize the task of building the Yumen Oil Mine into the first petroleum base in the motherland, we must further strengthen the Party's leadership, strengthen the Party's unity, strengthen the Party's political and ideological work, actively expand the Party's organization, unite all employees, and strive for the glorious cause of building the motherland's petroleum base in the Gobi Desert.

    党组织在建设中的监督保证作用
    中共玉门油矿委员会第一副书记  杨志范
    解放五年来，玉门油矿党的组织在恢复、改造与发展玉门油矿的生产工作中，体现了有力的监督保证作用。
    一九四九年秋天，由于中国人民解放军的神速进军，玉门油矿完整的回到了人民的怀抱。那时，党首先在职工群众中积极地进行了建党工作，将优秀工人采取训练班的方式，集中进行了共产主义和共产党的教育，吸收了其中觉悟高的工人入党。以后，党又在一系列的民主改革、生产改革等工作和劳动竞赛中进行发展新党员的工作，并注意对他们进行党员修养的教育。
    在党的不断教育下，共产党员们在建设玉门油矿的各项工作中，充分发挥了模范、核心作用。一九五二年全矿评选的劳动模范中，党员占百分之三十一，一九五三年上升至百分之三十八。目前占全矿职工百分之十五左右的共产党员，都已成为各种工作岗位上的骨干。
    共产党员们在生产中的英勇事迹是举不胜举的。有一次，油田顶部附近的某号井，发生了井口油管突然破裂的自然事故，造成了严重的井喷，油和气猛烈的喷洒出来。站在油井周围六、七公尺远的地方，都有被薰倒的危险。但是如不迅速制止井喷，其他油井的自喷能力即可能因此而遭到破坏，那是不可想像的浩大损失。这时，共产党员刘占虎等同志奋不顾身的冲到油井旁边，冒着油气的猛烈冲击，认真寻找井喷的原因，直到被油气薰得昏倒以前，仍然顽强不屈地坚持着工作。在共产党员这种顽强精神的感召下，职工们坚持了两昼夜的英勇斗争，终于制止了井喷，使油井恢复常态。
    在工作飞速发展，矿外不能供应技术干部和技术工人的情况下，玉门油矿党组织面临的一个严重任务，是必须从实际工作中大量培养技术和管理干部，以满足工作的需要。五年来，我们有计划地开办了全局性的和基层的包括党、政、工、团的各种干部训练班二百余次。领导各单位制定了对每个生产、职能机构预备干部的培养计划，采取订立互助合同、师徒合同、自修计划和确定专人包教等办法进行培养，使得我们各种生产岗位上有了后备的领导力量。党组织并通过鼓励、表扬、批评与自我批评，开经验座谈会等办法，随时关心和帮助干部的进步与提高。结果，原有的技术和管理干部在工作能力上得到提高，新的技术力量也成长起来了。钻井工作中新培养的司钻、司机和钻工等于解放初期的二十倍以上。提拔了干部一○一七名，其中玉门矿务局工人被提拔为车间以上的干部即达一一四名，
  （不包括调出的人数）。为了支援其他石油工业地区的工作，先后向外输出了九○五名技术工人与干部。没有大批干部的成长，是没有办法应付不断发展的局面的。
    团结和教育技术人员，是党领导企业生产的一个关键问题。玉门油矿是石油工业技术干部的集中地，这一工作特别重要。我们结合每一个时期的中心工作，进行了对技术干部的思想改造。党随时根据他们的思想动态，利用经常性的个别谈话或谈心会等方式，了解他们的困难和要求，尽量诱导启发，耐心恳切地帮助他们，使他们认识到党的政策的正确，明确技术为人民服务的观点。党组织经常鼓励技术人员深入车间、深入工地，使他们在现场工作中丰富自己的实际经验，并获得自我教育的机会。此外党组织还有意识地通过典型事实，对他们进行教育。曾经有一个技术人员因为不采纳工人意见，“闭门造车”的设计了扩充柴油冷榨厂的设计图，施工过程中造成十八次返工浪费，党组织即建议行政用这件事作典型进行处理，这教育了他本人，也教育了大家。炼油厂专责工程师何振鹏，以前只相信自己，看不起群众。党支部书记鼓励他有事多找工人研究商量。他多次和工人群众的互相研究，在实践中真正认识了群众的智慧，提高了觉悟。有一次冷榨厂液氨管子发生破裂时，他冒着窒息的危险进行抢救，受到全厂职工的赞扬。他又和工人群众共同钻研提出了改变溶剂油与重润滑油的混合比建议，突破了美国的技术标准，一年能为国家创造五亿二千余万元的价值。由于他逐渐认识了党的伟大，正确，经过他积极申请和参加“党员基本知识训练班”的学习，党终于在一九五二年六月接收他为共产党员。
    现在，玉门油矿的技术干部们，绝大部分都在勤勤恳恳地工作着，并努力学习业务、学习政治、学习俄文、学习苏联先进经验。由于他们政治觉悟的提高，申请入党的人逐年增加，经过党的考察，已经吸收了合乎共产党员标准的三十四人入党。
    要进一步发挥党在生产中的监督保证作用，就必须把政治工作和经济工作结合起来，使党的政治思想工作渗透到各种经济工作中去。我们几年来的作法是：首先要求党的各级组织必须熟悉生产计划，进而认真组织职工群众讨论计划，并检查计划的执行情况，发现计划执行过程中的问题，立即帮助加以解决。
    党积极热情地支持了职工们各种正确的创议，使之在生产中发挥应有的作用。一九五一年下半年为了在节约原油用量的基础上增加汽油产量，党组织提出了“提高汽油炼率”的号召，很多职工围绕这一课题积极找窍门挖潜力。青年团员戴玉如提出了裂炼厂加装二级蒸发塔的建议，使燃料油在低压下再蒸发，以提高炼率，但却遭到保守思想的抗拒和冷淡，戴玉如的建议被搁在档案柜里整整压了三个月。党组织发现了这一情况，立即组织有关人员进行研究，鉴定了这个建议的重大价值，并批判了各种错误认识和作风，又由行政上下了立即设计施工的命令，并限期完成。党支部一方面鼓励戴玉如进一步的钻研，一方面发动职工群众解决加装施工中的具体问题。又经过先进的技术工人围绕这一建议提出的八件有价值的补充建议，并进行了多次的试验，一九五二年五月，二级蒸发塔的加装工程终于试验成功，使汽油炼率提高百分之八到百分之十，在一年内即能为国家增产十亿零四千万元以上的财富。
    苏联专家的建议，很多是建设玉门油矿中的根本性问题，对玉门油矿的发展起了决定作用，全矿职工称专家的帮助是“头等的技术，真诚的心”。但专家建议并不是一开始就被所有同志深刻领会和重视的，而是经历了很长时期的摸索和努力才实现的。在贯彻专家建议中，党的保证监督作用占着极重要的地位。例如，修复“废井”是专家对采油工作的重大建议之一，起初很多人不服气，认为“修复废井，费时费钱、治聋成哑、来头不大。”经过领导上的一再坚持，党委书记亲自参加修井队会议，要求“保证出油”。党支部召开了老技工会议研究了解决修井工作中具体困难的办法，工作中又动员党员带头，共产党员刘公之找到了控制井喷规律，发挥了群众的积极性和智慧，使专家的建议被创造性的执行着。第一年即修复了五口“废井”，当年即增产了十三亿元，截至现在已修复了各种
  “废井”十一口，这在玉门油矿来说是史无前例的。
    每项建议的实现，就要引起设备、操作、管理制度等各方面的新的变化，在新的变化面前，就会出现很多新的困难、新的阻碍。因而在实际工作中，党组织又用细致的思想工作与组织工作来克服人们思想上的旧习惯和影响。
    发动职工群众开展劳动竞赛是完成国家计划、提高劳动生产率的主要方法。为将劳动竞赛引向正常和持久，党监督行政与工会认真签订了和切实履行了集体合同，使之成为全体职工的行动纲领。
    为了实现建设玉门油矿为祖国第一个石油基地的任务，我们必须进一步加强党的领导，加强党的团结，加强党的政治思想工作，积极扩大党的组织，团结全体职工，为在戈壁滩上建设祖国石油基地的光荣事业而努力。
