　　Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 6th: "National Evening News" published a statement by the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, to reporters regarding the "anti-communist" measures passed by the government.

　　Togliatti said: These measures are anti-democratic and anti-freedom. The government is attempting to usurp rights, using administrative measures to implement political discrimination against citizens and to abolish the freedom of assembly, association, and publication. This actually means eliminating the most important achievements of the revolution for freedom and democracy, which are mainly: the equal legal status of citizens and the freedom of publication, assembly, and association. ...

　　The government's increasingly blatant attempt to transform Italy from a democratic system into a police and reactionary autocratic regime cannot but arouse the anger of the vast majority of citizens. The consequences of these repressive measures will soon be felt. In a certain period, its results will be exactly the opposite of what those who are planning and attempting to implement these measures expect. It is absurd to think that repression can prevent the development of the Communist Party in Italy.

　　Our activities will focus on safeguarding and protecting the basic achievements of democracy: all citizens enjoy equal legal status; the government and the parties that make up the government abide by the law; and the people have the freedom to promote political progress, social progress, and peace.

　　Togliatti said: The purpose of our activities is to strive for the restoration of a truly democratic and republican regime.

    陶里亚蒂斥责意政府通过的“反共”措施
    指出党的活动将集中在维护和保障民主的基本成果
    【新华社六日讯】　据塔斯社罗马六日讯：“国家晚报”刊载了意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂就政府通过的“反共”措施向记者发表的谈话。
    陶里亚蒂说：这些措施是反民主反自由的措施。政府企图窃取权利，在行政措施的协助下，来对公民实行政治上的歧视，而且还要废除集会结社的自由和出版自由。这实际上是意味着要消灭自由和民主的革命的最重要的成果，这种成果主要是：公民的法律地位一律平等，出版和集会结社的自由。……
    政府的这种越来越明目张胆地把意大利从民主制度改变为警察和反动的专制统治的政权的企图，不能不引起极大多数公民的愤怒。这种镇压措施的后果将很快地被人感觉出来。在一定时期内，它的结果会和那些正在策划和企图实行这些措施的人们所预期的恰恰相反。认为镇压可以阻止共产党在意大利的发展，那是荒谬的。
    我们的活动将集中在维护和保障民主的基本成果：一切公民享有平等的法律地位；政府和组成政府的党派遵守法律；人民有宣传政治进步、社会进步和和平的自由。
    陶里亚蒂说：我们活动的目的就在于争取恢复一个真正民主和共和的政权。
