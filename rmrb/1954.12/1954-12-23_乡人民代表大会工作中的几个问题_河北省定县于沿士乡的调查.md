To universally promote and consolidate the system of People's Congresses at the township level after the grass-roots elections, and to adapt it to the requirements of the general task of the state's transitional period for grass-roots political power, is a pressing problem that needs to be solved. The situation of Yuyanshi Township, Ding County, Hebei Province, is presented here for reference in various regions.

Last July, Yuyanshi Township (including seven natural villages: Yuyanshi Village, Cuiyanshi Village, Wangyanshi Village, Zhao Jiawa Village, Goul Village, Qijiazuo Village, and Kang Zhuangzi Village) held general elections as a key township for pilot projects in Hebei Province. It conducted a democratic education for the masses and cadres of the entire township, enhanced the sense of ownership of the masses, and also strengthened the sense of responsibility of the People's Representatives and cadres. After the general election, the masses understood that "the representatives are working for the people and are the people's servants. We should carefully and cautiously elect representatives." The masses praised the elected representatives, saying: "The People's Representatives were selected one by one after more than forty days!" "Well done!" Because the general election was conducted seriously, conscientiously, and democratically, "being a representative is honorable" became a common feeling among the people of the entire township. The representatives also felt: "The People's Representatives have great responsibilities and must do a good job for the masses." In the central tasks, many representatives actively took the lead and were able to play a role in uniting and educating the masses. During the grain purchase work last year, Zhao Guixia, the representative of Zhao Jiawa Village, in addition to mobilizing her parents to sell 700 jin of surplus grain, also persuaded Zhao Luosheng's family to sell 300 jin. There are many similar examples of other representatives. Some representatives, in carrying out their government work, often paid attention to understanding the demands of the masses. Representative Cui Luoyi, the township's cultural and educational director, when he went to various villages to inspect the work of various primary schools, in addition to learning about the number of graduates from each village's primary school, also learned about the hopes of the students and the opinions of the students' parents. When the Third Township People's Congress was held last year, he proposed the establishment of a senior primary school at the meeting. Female representatives are particularly concerned about the problems of women. Generally, women who have problems also seek help from female representatives. Cui Luoqi, a representative of Cuiyanshi Village, in addition to actively taking on the work of the civil affairs commissioner, created a method of using storytelling to publicize government policies and extensively contacted the masses.

After the general election, the system of People's Congresses was initially established, laying the foundation for further strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship. However, from the practice of more than a year after the general election, there are still many problems in Yuyanshi Township in implementing the system of People's Congresses.

The first meeting of the Township People's Congress was held on August 3rd last year. At that time, with the leadership and help of the general election work team, more thorough preparations were made. Before the meeting, representative forums were held in natural villages to study the method of mobilizing the masses to submit proposals. Later, voter group meetings were held to solicit opinions. The Township People's Government specially established a proposal review team, which, in addition to having special personnel organize the proposals, also studied the principles for handling the proposals: those that were based on evidence or had clearly stipulated solutions (such as government instructions) were resolved according to regulations; those that could be immediately resolved through consultation with relevant departments were contacted and negotiated with relevant departments before the meeting (some were resolved through government research); those that could not be immediately resolved using the above two methods were reported to the superior government and forwarded to relevant departments, and representatives and the masses were informed after a reply was received. Because one of the main contents of this meeting was to elect members of the Township People's Government and the township head and deputy township heads, the candidates for members of the Township People's Government and the township head and deputy township heads were also deliberated and discussed before the meeting.

Due to the specific leadership and assistance of the general election work team, the meeting also proceeded more seriously. It rained on the day of the meeting, but except for three female representatives who did not attend due to difficulty in traveling, the remaining representatives attended the meeting in the rain. The meeting was first reported on by the original deputy township head on the work of the Township People's Government. The focus of the report was on the Township People's Government's leadership in agricultural production. At the same time, it also reviewed the problem that township cadres did not specifically and deeply lead mutual aid and cooperative organizations. After the report, the general representatives were satisfied, saying: "The township cadres' review is very sincere, and this will lead to progress in their work." The representatives also raised some criticisms of the work of the Township People's Government, such as Representative Liu Tongchui saying: "Township cadres' leadership is not in-depth, they have not gone to various villages to inspect and do not understand the situation of various villages enough. Some work after the township was divided is not as good as before." Representative Wang Laisheng said: "The work of the Township People's Government's departments has not been well established. For example, there is no activity in health work at all. Summer tax collection is still done by each natural village itself." The second content of the meeting was the election of members of the Township People's Government and the township head and deputy township heads. As a result of the election, Liu Yanchi was elected as the township head, and four deputy township heads and eleven members of the Township People's Government were elected. Township Head Liu Yanchi and Township People's Government member Zhang Wenzhi and others stated: "We guarantee to implement the resolutions of the People's Congress, accept the criticism of the masses, and do a good job in all work of the Township People's Government." The third content of the meeting was to discuss current work issues. Resolution: actively call on the masses to press green manure to lay a good foundation for planting wheat; do a good job in protecting the autumn harvest and autumn harvest, mobilize the masses to seize the time to dig corn and cut grain, and quickly plant buckwheat and wheat; strengthen the leadership of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives; pay attention to doing a good job in substitute plowing during the autumn harvest.

At the meeting, the representatives put forward more than 30 proposals, which concentratedly reflected the problems of the masses in production and life at that time. The problems in production, such as lending livestock, lending fertilizers, drilling wells, and repairing farm tools, were all explained according to the actual situation. Regarding the problems in life, such as the supply and marketing cooperative's untimely supply of daily necessities and the poor attitude of cadres, Cui Xilv, a cadre of the supply and marketing cooperative, expressed acceptance of the criticism and promised to correct it. Other issues, such as the supply and cadre style of the grain company and the oil company, were explained where possible, and those that needed to be reported to the higher-level government were reported to the higher level. All proposals were basically accounted for on a case-by-case basis. The representatives were satisfied. Li Zhaoyu from Qijiazuo Village said: "I will definitely convey to the masses one by one the county and district's respect for the opinions of the masses and the humble review of various departments."

Under the leadership and assistance of the general election work team, the new Township People's Government of Yuyanshi Township, in order to implement the resolutions of this meeting, immediately convened the first meeting of the Township People's Government Committee, and according to the resolutions of the meeting, with production as the center, made a work plan for August and September (last year). The representatives returned to their respective villages and also conveyed the resolutions of the meeting and the handling of the proposals. Among them, Zhao Jiawa Village held a village-wide "question and answer session," providing answers to the questions raised by the masses that had already been answered, and explaining those that were still being processed. Other villages conveyed the information at mass meetings to implement other tasks.

However, after the general election work team left, the situation of the second to eighth meetings of the People's Congress of Yuyanshi Township was different from the first.

First of all, the preparations for several meetings were not adequate. The representatives usually knew about the meeting the day before or the day of the meeting. Even if there was time, there was no activity to collect proposals like before the first meeting. In addition to saying "Bring proposals to participate in the meeting" in the notice, the township leaders left it to the representatives to decide for themselves whether or not there were actual proposals. At the second and third meetings, some representatives made a small number of proposals; at the fourth meeting, there were no proposals; at the fifth meeting, the representatives came up with some temporary proposals at the group discussions. There were a small number of proposals at the sixth meeting; there were no proposals at the seventh meeting; at the eighth meeting, the representatives came up with a few temporary proposals again at the group discussions. The notification of the representatives to attend the meeting was also done carelessly. The attendance of the representatives was: twelve representatives were absent from the second meeting; fourteen representatives were absent from the third meeting, exceeding one-third of the total number of representatives, and all six representatives from Qijiazuo Village were absent. At the fifth meeting, the notification was forgotten in advance, and the representatives from Zhao Jiawa Village were only found at the last minute before the meeting, and as a result, only three of the eight representatives came (two went to the district to handle affairs). At the sixth and seventh meetings, the representatives were also very poorly attended. At the eighth meeting, some villages notified the representatives only at the last minute before the meeting, and some were not notified at all. As a result, twelve representatives were absent from the meeting.

At the second, third, fifth, sixth, and eighth meetings, the township head also reported on the work of the Township People's Government in the past period, but the representatives did not raise any opinions or raised very few opinions. The fourth meeting was specifically held to implement the work of unified purchase and sale of grain, and there was no government work report. The seventh meeting was specifically held to elect representatives to the County People's Congress, and there was no government work report. In addition, the second meeting discussed and approved the candidates for the cadres of the Township People's Government's departments, discussed the primary schools and civil schools in various villages, the rights of the People's Representatives, and how to deal with People's Representatives who do not abide by the laws; and approved the cancellation of the qualifications of Zhang Jinfang (male) and Liu Guixue (female) as People's Representatives (because they resisted the implementation of the Marriage Law). (Editor's note: The removal of representatives should be discussed and decided by the voters in the original electoral district. The method of using the People's Congress meeting to make the decision is incorrect.) The third meeting discussed the establishment of a private senior primary school in the township and the relocation of the Zhaixidian Village senior primary school in the neighboring township to Zhao Jiawa Village, as well as the distribution of material subsidies to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. Another content of this meeting was to arrange for autumn plowing and call for increased income and more planting of yam land. The fourth meeting was held after studying the state's general task during the transition period last year, at the beginning of the implementation of the unified purchase and sale work. The meeting discussed the significance of unified purchase and sale and how to complete it. Finally, the representatives of each village estimated the sales figures. After this, it was not until March 24th of this year that Yuyanshi Township held the fifth meeting of the People's Congress. The main content of the meeting was to implement the current central task, that is, to prepare for spring plowing production, expand the area of cotton and oil crops, and purchase the 1954 national economic construction bonds. In addition, the establishment of a senior primary school was discussed, and resolutions were made on issues such as school buildings and teachers; the change of status of the landlord Zhang Jinhua in Yuyanshi Village was also discussed. The sixth meeting was held at the end of June this year, and the work of incidental levy and purchase of wheat was discussed. The seventh meeting was held on July 4th. It was not until November 16th that the eighth meeting was held, the main content of which was to implement the work of autumn tax collection, unified purchase and sale, and mutual aid and cooperation. Judging from the progress of these conferences, the spirit of democratic consultation was not fully developed. To implement a central task or deal with a problem, it was often a matter of one person reporting, everyone not being able to express any opinions, and then it being passed. For example, at the fifth meeting, the issue of changing the status of the landlord Zhang Jinhua in Yuyanshi Village was raised for representatives to discuss and decide, but the representatives did not understand the specific situation and asked for a detailed report. The chairman of the congress, Liu Yanchi, told everyone: "Yuyanshi Village has already discussed it and there is no problem." The representatives casually passed the change of Zhang Jinhua's status in this way. After the proposals were put forward, they were not first discussed and studied by the representatives together, and the issues that could be resolved were made into resolutions. The representatives considered that submitting proposals was "completing the task," and only listened to the explanation of the chairman of the congress, Liu Yanchi, or explained that they should be reported to the higher authorities, and then it was over. The eighth meeting was also conducted very hastily. For example, regarding the determination of the candidates for the evaluation committee for unified purchase and sale, some villages only temporarily named a few people by the representatives present.

The implementation of the resolutions of the second to eighth meetings of the Township People's Congress was left to its own devices. The Township People's Government Committee did not seriously discuss how to implement the resolutions as it did after the first meeting of the People's Congress. After the third, fourth, fifth, seventh, and eighth meetings, the Township People's Government Committee did not hold any meetings. At each meeting, although the representatives were called upon to "convey and implement them well to the masses," in reality, everyone did not clearly understand its importance, and the leadership never conducted any supervision or inspection. Zhao Jiawa Village, which did a slightly better job, also mentioned it incidentally at the village mass meeting each time; the situation in Goul Village was the same. In other villages, it was mentioned incidentally when there was a village mass meeting, and if there was no meeting, it was over, and it was only "spoken" by the representatives individually and at their own discretion. Many problems had already been resolved at the congress, but because they were not conveyed, the masses would still raise them to the cadres for the second time and express their dissatisfaction. Taking only the township cadres' duty system as an example, some masses would come to the township government very early every morning to ask for business, but the cadres on duty had not yet arrived, so they were dissatisfied and said: "There is no one in the township." At the fifth meeting, a regulation was made on this issue: the township cadres' duty should start every day after breakfast. Because some villages did not convey this, the masses still did not know about it, and came before breakfast again when they had something to do, and were dissatisfied again when they could not find anyone. Other problems were the same.

The sense of ownership of the people of Yuyanshi Township has been enhanced after the general election, but it has not been fully transformed into material strength; the system of Township People's Congresses has been established, but it has not played its due role in leading and promoting production.

What is the problem?

First, the work team that led the general election to Yuyanshi Township last year did not teach the township cadres the working methods for implementing the system of People's Congresses in a down-to-earth manner, and they took over some of the work during the general election experiment. When Yuyanshi Township held the first meeting of the People's Congress, the preparations before the meeting, the progress of the meeting, and the implementation of the resolutions were relatively thorough. However, the general election work team did not let the township cadres and representatives experiment more on their own in each stage of the work; after the meeting, it did not help the township cadres and representatives to summarize their work experience well. As a result, after the work team left, the People's Congress meetings in Yuyanshi Township were not more and more satisfactory than the previous one, and the awareness and ability of the cadres and representatives were not improved more and more than the previous one.

Second, township cadres still have some vague concepts about the system of People's Congresses in their thinking, which also hinders the conscientious implementation of this system. The holding of several meetings of the People's Congress of Yuyanshi Township, as the party general branch secretary and township head Liu Yanchi said, "is a routine national system." In reality, the township cadres did not regard the Township People's Congress as an organ for the people of the entire township to exercise their democratic rights, and major issues were resolved through meetings. Liu Yanchi said: "When the central task comes, the work of all departments is neglected." Obviously, they did not regard the People's Congress as an organ of power and a central link in mobilizing the masses to implement the state's various tasks, but regarded it as "department work." Recently, when we talked to Liu Yanchi about the People's Congress, he said: "There are many meetings, and it is enough for everyone to know about a task, why go through that formality?" Regarding holding meetings of the People's Congress as a formality and opposing it to the central task. This kind of thinking will certainly hinder the conscientious implementation of the system of People's Congresses. Regarding the role of the People's Congress, some cadres in Yuyanshi Township, and even the main cadres of the township, believe that "the meetings of the People's Congress are repetitive with the cadres' meetings," so "they are not energetic" and "they are not effective." Indeed, most of the People's Representatives are party members and Youth League members, and there are even more cadres. Of the 35 People's Representatives in the entire township, only 4 are not cadres, 26 are party members, and 3 are Youth League members. When Yuyanshi Township implemented a central task, it was after convening a party general branch meeting (or an enlarged meeting of the party general branch), that an enlarged meeting of township cadres or a meeting of party members and Youth League members was convened. After the enlarged meeting of township cadres, only four of the thirty-five People's Representatives had not participated; after the meeting of party members and Youth League members, only six of the representatives who were not party members and Youth League members had not participated. Therefore, if another meeting of the People's Congress is to be held, some cadres believe that it is "repetitive" and therefore do not pay attention to it. This reflects an important issue, that is, the comrades in the grass-roots organizations confuse the nature and tasks of the meetings of the state power organs and the meetings of the executive organs, and cannot distinguish them clearly. The meeting of the state power organ, that is, the meeting of the People's Congress, is to review the work of the government in a certain period, and to discuss and decide on major issues. Its decisions are handed over to the government for implementation, and the People's Representatives also convey the resolutions to the people and take the lead in implementing the resolutions. The work of the government (that is, the executive organ) is carried out according to the decisions of the state power organ. If there are temporary important tasks, of course, certain measures can be taken first to complete the tasks, but a report must be made at the meeting of the People's Congress, and reviewed and approved by the People's Congress. If there are shortcomings and errors in the work, criticisms can be made at the meeting of the congress, and corresponding decisions can be made. As for the party's internal meetings, they are to unify the actions of party members and ensure the implementation of the party's policies, and they cannot be confused with other meetings.

Third, the county and district lack regular leadership over the township People's Congress. Yuyanshi Township is the township that conducted the general election the earliest in the entire county and district. The county and district's leadership over this township should attach importance to the implementation of the system of People's Congresses. But the fact is not like this. After the general election, cadres from the county rarely came to this township. For a long time, the county knew very little about the situation of this township after the general election, and of course, there was no specific leadership given in response to the various situations after the general election. Sometimes when cadres or work teams came, they only came for a single task or a central task, and they left after the task was completed, and they did not ask about the implementation of the system of People's Congresses. Recently, the work team that came to implement the work of unified purchase and sale did not pay attention to the implementation of the system of People's Congresses. The district's leadership over Yuyanshi Township is the same as that of ordinary townships. When we asked the district about how the People's Congress of Yuyanshi Township was led, the district party committee secretary Chai Fushe said: "We don't have time to manage it usually. When the central task comes, we implement it from the party and Youth League system to get results." The People's Congress should be the central link in implementing the central task. How can the People's Congress be opposed to the central task? Furthermore, looking at the daily activities of the People's Representatives, the general situation is also left to its own devices. In various tasks, many People's Representatives have played some role to varying degrees, but this is only as individual activities, and the leadership has not conducted leadership over them. If the leadership can pay attention to the leadership of the People's Representatives, strengthen their education, and specifically teach them some working methods, the vast majority of the People's Representatives will actively participate and play their due role.

    乡人民代表大会工作中的几个问题
    ——河北省定县于沿士乡的调查
    中流、鉴远
    基层选举以后，如何在乡级普遍推行并巩固人民代表大会制度，使其适应国家过渡时期总任务对于基层政权的要求，是一个迫切需要解决的问题。现在把河北省定县于沿士乡的情况介绍出来，供各地参考。
    去年七月，于沿士乡（包括七个自然村，即于沿士村、崔沿士村、王沿士村、赵家洼村、沟里村、齐家佐村、康庄子村）作为河北省试办重点乡举行了普选，对全乡群众和干部进行了一次民主教育，增强了群众的主人翁感，也增强了人民代表和干部的责任感。经过普选，群众懂得了“代表是给人民办事的，是人民的勤务员。应该谨慎小心地选代表”。群众称赞已选出的代表说：“人民代表是经过四十多天一个个挑出来的！”“好样的！”由于普选进行得严肃、认真和民主，“当代表光荣”成了全乡人民共同的感觉。代表们也感到：“人民代表责任很大，要好好为群众办事情。”在中心工作中，许多代表都积极带头，并能起团结群众和教育群众的作用。去年购粮工作时，赵家洼村代表赵贵霞除动员自己父母卖了七百斤余粮外，还打通赵洛盛家的思想，也卖了三百斤。其他代表也有不少这类事例。有的代表在进行自己所担任的政府工作中，经常注意了解群众的要求。代表崔洛益是乡文教主任，当他到各村检查各小学工作时，除了解到各村小学毕业生的数目等以外，并了解学生们的希望和学生家长的意见。去年召开第三次乡人民代表大会时，他便在大会上提出了设立高级小学校的提案。女代表特别关心妇女们的问题。一般妇女群众有问题，也多找女代表帮助解决。崔沿士村代表崔洛歧，除了积极负起民政委员的工作以外，曾经创造了说故事宣传政府政策的办法，广泛地联系了群众。
    经过普选，开始建立了人民代表大会制度，为进一步加强人民民主专政打下了基础。但从普选后一年多的实践看，于沿士乡在贯彻人民代表大会制度方面还存在不少问题。
    乡第一次人民代表大会会议是去年八月三日召开的。当时由于有普选工作组的领导和帮助，作了较周到的准备工作。开会前，以自然村为单位召开了代表座谈会，研究了发动群众提提案的方法。以后又召开选民小组会征求意见。乡人民政府特成立了提案审查小组，除由专人对提案作整理外，并研究了提案处理原则：凡是有根据或有明文规定解决办法的（如政府指示）按规定解决；凡能马上和有关部门联系协商解决的，在会前和有关部门联系解决（有的通过政府研究解决）；凡不能马上用以上两种办法解决的，呈报上级政府转给有关部门，待答复后，再告知代表和群众。因为这一次会议的主要内容之一是选举乡人民政府委员和正副乡长，所以会前还进行了乡人民政府委员和正副乡长候选人的酝酿、讨论。
    由于有普选工作组的具体领导和帮助，会议也进行得比较认真。开会那天下雨，但除了三个女代表因为行走困难没有到会以外，其余代表都冒雨参加会议。会议首先由原副乡长报告乡人民政府的工作。报告的中心是乡人民政府领导农业生产的情况。同时也检讨了乡干部没有具体深入领导互助合作组织的问题。报告后一般代表认为满意，说：“乡干部的检讨很虚心，这样工作才会有进步。”代表们对乡人民政府的工作也提出了一些批评，如代表刘铜锤说：“乡干部领导工作不深入，没有到各村进行检查，了解各村情况不够。划乡后有些工作不如以前。”代表王来胜说：“乡人民政府的部门工作还没有很好树立，比如卫生工作根本没有活动，夏征还是各自然村自己做的。”会议的第二个内容是选举乡人民政府委员和正副乡长。选举结果，刘砚池当选为乡长，并选举了四个副乡长和十一个乡人民政府委员，乡长刘砚池、乡人民政府委员张文治等都表示：“保证执行人民代表大会决议，接受群众批评，作好乡人民政府一切工作。”会议的第三个内容是讨论当前的工作问题。决议：积极号召群众压绿肥，为种麦打下良好基础；作好护秋和秋收工作，发动群众抓紧刨玉米、割谷，迅速种上荞麦和小麦；加强对互助组和农业生产合作社的领导；在秋收中注意作好代耕工作。
    会上，代表们提出了提案三十多件，集中地反映了当时群众生产和生活上的问题。生产上的贷牲口、贷肥料、打井、修理农具等问题，都根据实际情况作了交代。关于生活上的问题，如供销社对日用品供应不及时和干部态度不好等，供销社干部崔喜绿表示接受批评，并保证改正。其他如粮食公司和油脂公司的供应和干部作风等问题，可以解释的作了解释，须呈报上级政府的，向上呈报。所有的提案，基本上作到了案案有交代。代表们都满意。齐家佐村李造玉说：“我一定把县、区尊重群众意见和各部门虚心检讨的情形，一件件传达给群众。”
    在普选工作组的领导和帮助下，于沿士乡新的乡人民政府为贯彻这一次会议的决议，紧接着召开了第一次乡人民政府委员会，根据会议决议，以生产为中心，作出了八、九月份（去年）的工作计划。代表们回到各村，对大会决议和提案处理情况也都进行了传达。其中赵家洼村召开了全村的“解答会”，对群众所提问题已经有了确实结果的给以解答，还在继续处理的也作了说明。别村则在贯彻其他工作的群众大会上作了传达。
    但在普选工作组走后，于沿士乡第二次到第八次人民代表大会会议召开的情况就和第一次不一样了。
    首先，几次会议的准备工作都作得不够。代表们知道要开会多半是在开会的头一天或当天。即使有时间，也没有像第一次会议前那样进行搜集提案的活动，乡领导干部除了在通知上说一句“随带提案前来参加会议”以外，实际有没有提案，是自流的。第二、三次会议，有的代表提了少量提案；第四次会议，没有提案；第五次会议，代表们在小组讨论会上临时想出了一些提案。第六次会议有少量提案；第七次会议没提案；第八次会议，又是代表们在小组讨论会上临时想出了几个提案。通知代表开会这件事也作的潦草，代表到会的情况是：第二次会议有十二个代表没到；第三次会议有十四个代表没到，超过了代表总数的三分之一，而其中齐家佐村的六个代表全部没到。第五次会议，事前忘了通知，赵家洼村代表临开会时才找人，结果八个代表只来了三个（两人去区里办事）。第六次和第七次会议，代表们也到的很不齐。第八次会议有的村又是临开会了才通知代表，有的就没通知到，结果十二个代表没到会。
    第二、三、五、六、八次会议上，也都由乡长就乡人民政府过去一段时期的工作作了报告，但代表们没提什么意见或提意见很少。第四次会议是专为贯彻粮食统购统销工作召开的，没有政府工作报告。第七次会议是专为选县人民代表大会代表召开的，也没有政府工作报告。另外，第二次会议上曾经讨论并通过了乡人民政府各部门干部的人选，讨论了各村小学校和民校问题，人民代表的权利问题以及人民代表不遵守法令如何处理等问题；并通过取消张进发（男）和刘贵雪（女）的人民代表资格
  （因为他们抗拒执行婚姻法）。（编者按：代表的撤换应当由原选区选民讨论决定，该村采用由人民代表大会会议作决定的办法是不对的。）第三次会议上则讨论了乡里建立私立高级小学校和邻乡寨西店村高级小学校迁移到赵家洼村的问题，烈属、军属实物补助的发放问题。这次会议的又一内容是布置秋耕，号召增加收入，多耕山药地。第四次会议是去年学习国家在过渡时期的总任务之后，贯彻统购统销工作开始时召开的。会上就统购统销的意义和如何完成进行了讨论，最后由各村代表估计一下售粮数字。这以后，直到今年三月二十四日于沿士乡才举行人民代表大会第五次会议。会议主要内容是贯彻当前中心工作，即准备春耕生产、扩大棉田和油料作物面积，以及认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债。另外讨论了设立高级小学校的问题，就校舍、师资等问题作了决议；还讨论了于沿士村地主张晋华改变成份的问题。第六次会议是今年六月底召开的，就小麦的随征带购工作进行了讨论。第七次会议是七月四日召开的。又直到十一月十六日才召开了第八次会议，主要内容是贯彻秋征、统购统销、互助合作等工作。从这几次大会进行的情况看，会议中民主协商的精神还不充分。贯彻一件中心工作或处理一个问题，常常是一个人报告报告，大家发表不出什么意见，就通过了。如第五次会议上提出了于沿士村地主张晋华改变成份的问题让代表们讨论决定，代表们不了解具体情况，要求详细报告。大会主席刘砚池告诉大家：“于沿士村已经作过讨论，没问题。”代表们就这样马虎通过了改变张晋华的成份。提案提出以后，也不首先经过代表们共同讨论研究，把能解决的作成决议。代表们是提出提案就算“完成任务”，只听大会主席刘砚池解释一番，或说明应向上级反映，就算过去了。第八次会议进行的也很草率，如关于统购统销的评议委员会人选的确定，有的村只是由到会代表临时说出几个人就算了。
    第二次到第八次乡人民代表大会会议决议的贯彻，都陷于自流状态。乡人民政府委员会也不像人民代表大会第一次会议之后那样，认真地讨论如何贯彻决议。第三、四、五、七、八次会议之后，乡人民政府委员会都没有开过会。在每次会议上，虽然曾经号召代表们“好好向群众传达贯彻”，实际上大家并不明确其重要性，领导上也从来没有进行过督促检查。作得稍好的赵家洼村，每次也都是在村群众大会上附带说一下；沟里村也是如此。其他村，遇到了村里开群众大会则附带说一下，遇不到便算了，只是由代表个别地自流地“说说”。许多问题本来是大会上已经解决了的，但因没有传达，群众仍然会第二次向干部提出，并表示不满。仅以乡干部值班制度看，有些群众每天清晨很早就找到乡政府请求办事，值班干部还没来，于是就不满意地说：“乡里没人。”第五次会议上对这问题作了规定：乡干部值班每天从吃过早饭开始。有的村因为没传达，群众还不知道，有事又早饭前来了，一找没人，又是不满意。其他问题也有同样情况。
    于沿士乡人民在普选后主人翁感增强了，但是它并没有充分地变为物质力量；乡人民代表大会的制度已经建立起来了，但它也没有在领导和推动生产中起到应有的作用。
    问题何在呢？
    第一，去年到于沿士乡领导普选的工作组没把执行人民代表大会制度的工作方法踏实地教给乡干部，在普选试验过程中，有些工作他们包办了。于沿士乡召开人民代表大会第一次会议时，会前准备工作，会议的进行和决议的贯彻都比较周到。但各阶段的工作，普选工作组没有放手让乡里干部和代表自己多试验；会后，也没有很好地帮助乡里干部和代表自己总结工作经验。以致工作组走后，于沿士乡的人民代表大会会议不是一次比一次开得圆满，干部、代表的觉悟和能力不是一次比一次提高。
    第二，乡干部思想上对人民代表大会制度还存在着若干模糊观念，也障碍了这一制度的认真贯彻。于沿士乡几次人民代表大会会议的召开，正像党总支书记兼乡长刘砚池所说“是例行国家制度”。实际上乡干部并没有把乡人民代表大会当作是全乡人民行使民主权利的机关，有重大问题就开会解决。刘砚池说：“中心工作一来，各部门工作就都顾不得了。”显然，他们并没有把人民代表大会看作权力机关和动员群众贯彻国家各项任务的中心环节，而是把它看作“部门工作”。最近我们和刘砚池谈起人民代表大会时，他说：“会议很多，一件工作大家都知道了就算了，何必走那形式？”把开人民代表大会会议也作为一种形式，并和中心工作对立起来了。这种思想，当然要阻碍人民代表大会制度的认真贯彻。关于人民代表大会的作用，于沿士乡的某些干部甚至乡的主要干部都认为：“人民代表大会会议和干部会重复”，所以“不带劲”，“不顶事”。的确，大部分人民代表都是党员、团员，作干部的更多。全乡人民代表三十五人，不是干部的仅四人，党员二十六人，团员三人。于沿士乡贯彻一件中心工作时，是在召开了党总支会议（或党总支扩大会议）之后，就召开乡干部扩大会议，或召开党团员大会。开了乡干部扩大会，三十五个人民代表中就只有四个没参加过了；开了党团员大会，也就只有六个不是党团员的代表没参加过了。所以再要开人民代表大会会议，某些干部便认为是“重复”，因而不重视。这里反映着一个重要的问题，就是基层组织中的同志们把国家权力机关会议和执行机关会议的性质任务混淆起来，分不清楚。国家权力机关的会议，即人民代表大会会议，是在一定时期来审查政府工作，讨论和决定重大问题的。它的决定，交与政府执行，人民代表也向人民传达决议，并带头执行决议。政府（即执行机关）的工作，则是根据国家权力机关的决定来进行。有临时性重要任务，当然也可以先采取一定措施，完成任务，但在人民代表大会开会时必须作报告，由人民代表大会审查批准。工作中有缺点错误，大会会议可开展批评，并作出相应的决定。至于党内的会议，那是为了统一党员行动，保证贯彻党的政策的，更不能和其他会议混淆。
    第三，县、区对乡人民代表大会缺乏经常领导。于沿士乡在全县全区是最早进行了普选的乡，县、区对这乡的领导，应该重视人民代表大会制度的贯彻。但事实不是这样。普选后，县里干部很少来过这个乡，在很长的时期，县里对这个乡普选后的情况也了解很少，当然谈不到针对普选后的各种情况给以具体领导了。有时来了干部或工作组，也只为了某一件单纯的工作或某一中心工作，任务完了便走了，也不过问人民代表大会制度的执行。最近为了贯彻统购统销等工作而来的工作组也就没注意人民代表大会制度的执行。区对于沿士乡的领导也同于一般乡。当我们问区里对于沿士乡的人民代表大会是怎么领导的，区委书记柴福社说：“平时没工夫管，中心工作来了，就从党、团系统贯彻，要成绩。”人民代表大会正应该成为贯彻中心工作的中心环节，怎么能把人民代表大会和中心工作对立起来呢？再以人民代表的日常活动来看，总的情况也是自流的。在各种工作中，不少人民代表已经不同程度的起了一些作用，但这仅仅是作为个体的活动，领导上对他们没有进行过领导。如果领导上能够注意对人民代表的领导，加强对他们的教育，并具体教给他们一些工作方法，绝大部分人民代表都会积极起来，发挥应有的作用的。
