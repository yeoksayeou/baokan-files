Chairman and fellow delegates,

I previously participated in the fake government of Chiang Kai-shek and took the wrong path of opposing the people. Today, I am honored to speak at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, and I feel both honored and apprehensive.

I have committed grave crimes against the people in the past. Recently, I have publicly confessed to the nation, and I deeply regret my past actions. Today, I would like to report on my thought process of turning towards the people.

In 1948, I resigned from the position of the fake Executive Yuan. I began to consider the prospect of the Communist Party liberating the nation. At that time, my thoughts were divided between public and private interests. On the private side, I had been part of the reactionary government for too long and had deeply wronged the people, causing me to feel great fear. On the public side, I felt that the actions and policies of the fake government of Chiang Kai-shek were indeed harmful to the people and the nation. The Communist Party saved China from its dire straits and brought it out of chaos, which was a highly welcome event. In this mental state, I felt that even to save myself from a miserable fate, I should not continue on the reactionary path.

From 1949 to 1950, to avoid interference from the fake government in Taiwan, I resided in Paris. At that time, I observed the world situation and saw that on one hand, the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union had either eliminated or was in the process of eliminating the exploiting classes and was seriously building and advancing, like the rising sun. On the other hand, the imperialist countries, with monopolistic capitalists in power, oppressed the working people at home and plundered and exploited abroad. China had suffered cruel oppression from imperialism for over a hundred years. The fake government of Chiang Kai-shek was selfish and reactionary, willingly selling out the country, making imperialism even more aggressive against China. Fortunately, China was liberated, and the new government led by the working class was established, providing a great opportunity for China's independence and self-reliance. I had been a helper of Chiang Kai-shek, indeed taking the wrong path of opposing the country and the people. I must change my ways and return to the country, correct my past mistakes, and strive for the opportunity to redeem my sins.

However, making this decision was not simple or easy. I had been listed as a war criminal by the people. Returning to the country, I could not help but have some concerns about my safety. In Paris, I was under surveillance by the fake embassy, and it was difficult to obtain a permit from the British government to pass through Hong Kong. The Americans tried to bribe me, inviting me to the U.S. and offering me financial incentives. Such obstacles and temptations all came to shake my resolve. My conclusion was that I could not be afraid of difficulties and could not accept temptations. At this critical juncture, I must firmly carry out my plan to turn from darkness to light, only then could I do right by my country. Therefore, I made up my mind and flew back.

I have been living in the capital, Beijing, for nearly four years now. Unexpectedly, the people have been very lenient with me. During this period, I have worked on translating works related to geology without any restrictions or constraints. Now, I am honored to be invited as a member of the second National Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference, which makes me see that the people of our country are opening a path of repentance and self-reform for those who have previously gone astray. As long as one sincerely loves the country and is not afraid of having no way out, one can turn towards the people. I have received such lenient treatment, which has strengthened my resolve to work for the people to atone for my past sins.

In the four years since my return to the country, I have seen many phenomena of the new China after liberation, which have allowed me to understand the truth and see with my own eyes the great task of eliminating the old and establishing the new, building a socialist society under the leadership of the working class.

From my personal experience in geology and economics, I have worked in geology for many years. Although I lacked leadership, I could not promote it; but the previous reactionary governments only sought to oppress and exploit the people and did not value science at all. They treated geological institutions, like other scientific institutions, as unimportant decorations. Therefore, there were very few geologists, and although they worked hard, they were not valued. Now, everything is different. Under the people's democratic system, the number of geologists has increased significantly, and drilling and exploration work has been fully promoted. Under the leadership of the Geological Bureau, with a focus and plan, based on advanced Soviet experience, progress has been made, achieving significant results far beyond the previous stagnant situation. Moreover, due to the annual progress of the construction plan, the geological sector still needs more personnel and more exploration, which is being developed in increasing quantities, truly providing basic data for construction work.

When I participated in the fake government of Chiang Kai-shek, I was particularly concerned about China's economy. At that time, it was the era of bureaucratic capitalism. Especially the Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen families used their power to seize wealth, amass property, and become a special stratum that controlled power, causing the national economy to shake at its roots and the people's lives to become increasingly impoverished. At that time, I was deeply moved by this situation. Looking back now, I myself was also a member of the bureaucratic capitalist clique, trapped in it, and was no different. After liberation, through thorough reform, the landlord class has been eliminated by land reform, and the enterprises of national capitalists are also being transformed in the process of development. The socialist economic component has taken the lead, laying the foundation for the socialist economy of the new China. On such a foundation, we can truly achieve real results in national construction. From this, it can be seen that the so-called construction of the fake government was just a cover for exploiting the people and selling out the country, with no meaning other than self-deception and deceiving others. Therefore, I deeply feel that my economic work in the fake government was indeed of an anti-country and anti-people nature.

From this, it can be seen that the nature of the government is fundamentally related. The government centered around Chiang Kai-shek, regardless of whether it was "tutelage" or "constitutionalism," was essentially a fascist dictatorship. The goal of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship was for his personal position, the interests of the bureaucratic comprador class, and his power to suppress the people. Such a government would naturally be willing to help and collude with any imperialist country. Because he could not succeed in colluding with Japanese imperialism, he knelt down and surrendered to American imperialism, acting even more obsequiously. Such behavior was undoubtedly a treacherous policy of harming the country and the people. Now, the traitorous clique has fled to Taiwan. Apart from this, the vast territory has returned to the people, freeing itself from the shackles of imperialism, and the humiliation accumulated over a hundred years has been swept away. China has truly achieved independence and self-reliance, and its international status has risen to an unprecedented height, showing the superiority of the people's democratic system. We must jointly support it. What is regrettable is that the traitorous clique in Taiwan is inciting the United States to launch a crazy attack on the motherland. We must strengthen our efforts to resist aggression and defend our territory, liberate Taiwan, and eliminate the traitorous clique.

In summary, during my time of returning to the motherland, all phenomena have made me see that China has been able to revive because of its liberation, and because it can resist imperialism, it can maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Because it is advancing towards socialism, it can achieve success in construction. The reason for such progress is that it relies on the leadership of the working class, advancing towards the goal indicated by Marxism-Leninism. In this transitional period, it is even more necessary to unite as one, under the leadership of the Communist Party, correct our stance, and through the reform movement, advance towards a socialist society. Like me, who has previously taken the wrong political path, we must firmly resolve to seriously study and use new knowledge to eliminate the remnants of my old thoughts. I know that my political knowledge is extremely backward, and my understanding of socialism is still insufficient. I must resolutely and persistently study to catch up with the times after liberation. I will definitely reform myself, respect the people, and serve the country to fulfill my responsibility to the motherland.

Fellow delegates, we have entered the bright era from the old era of the old government's rule, and we cannot help but compare the current situation with the past. We clearly see that the good practices and great achievements in politics, economics, and culture today are impossible under the rule of the old government. We must support the people's democratic system led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive towards the socialist goal. We are still in the transitional period, and the exploiting elements still need to be gradually eliminated. The non-socialist economic forces still need to be actively transformed, and the old feudal backward thoughts have not been completely eliminated. American imperialism and the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek are still attacking us. In such a situation, we have even more reason to redouble our efforts. I am willing to contribute my humble efforts, together with all the delegates, to strengthen our work on the united front of the people's democracy, and strive together to build a strong and prosperous socialist society as soon as possible.

Chairman and fellow delegates,

I have listened to Vice Chairman Chen Chutong's report on the work of the first National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and to Commissioner Zhang Bogong's explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I fully agree and completely support them. I believe that the people's democratic system led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, has opened up a broad path for the development of socialism in our country. Since the establishment of the Central People's Government in 1949, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, in just a few years, we have revived and strengthened a China that was once a sick man of East Asia, on the verge of death. This is the important role played by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's united front, which is a magical elixir that brings the dead back to life. The united front is a magical elixir, and in our transitional period, this elixir is still needed and cannot be dispensed with. In the future, in mobilizing and uniting the people of the entire country to complete the total tasks of the transitional period and to fight against internal and external enemies, our people's democratic united front will still play its role, especially in the general principles of the draft constitution, which regulates the seven common principles to be followed, and has already included the tasks of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference without omission. Finally, in Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, the analysis of the international situation is far-sighted and has foresight, so in resisting American aggression and aiding Korea, we are sure to win, and in diplomatic negotiations, we can hold the initiative. Our country's international status is rising day by day, which is not accidental. The facts are in front of us: with a wise government and a wise Chairman Mao, we can do a good job for the country. We advocate peace, but we are not afraid of war. We have the indomitable spirit of the entire nation, and the hearts of the people who maintain world peace are invincible. Airplanes and cannons can be bought with money, but the hearts of the people and the spirit cannot be bought with money. I am excited to feel that in the new era of Mao Zedong, I am ashamed of my old age and lack of contribution, and I can only strive forward under the banner of Mao Zedong, following the Communist Party, to complete the cause of socialism.

Chairman and fellow delegates,

The day before yesterday, we listened to Vice Chairman Zhou's political report, which gave us a good analysis and guidance on the current situation. I, like everyone else, fully support it. Then, there is Vice Chairman Chen Chutong's report on the work of the first National Committee of the Political Consultative Conference and Commissioner Zhang Bogong's explanation of the draft constitution of the Political Consultative Conference. These two documents have been discussed extensively in small groups and are basically agreed upon by everyone, hoping that the conference will formally pass them.

I was originally a member of the first National Committee of the Political Consultative Conference and was nominated again to participate in the second National Committee. This makes me feel both ashamed and moved and excited. I can't help but want to say a few more words.

For many years, I have thought that I have my own understanding and even a set of solutions to the problems of China, and I was very confident. Even after liberation, facing the great fact that the Communist Party led the revolution to success, which cannot be denied, I had to surrender; at the same time, I could not help but surrender to the Marxism-Leninism that provides the theoretical source for the Communist Party. But after participating in the first Political Consultative Conference, although I also followed everyone to study, on the surface, it seemed that my thoughts and consciousness had changed a lot, but in fact, it was still the old set of thoughts and views that occupied my mind, and it was difficult to eradicate. In these few years in the Political Consultative Conference, I have not only made no contribution but have also made many mistakes. Like last September, at the expanded meeting of the Political Consultative Conference Standing Committee, I made serious mistakes. After receiving the leadership's criticism and the guidance of friends, I was able to reflect deeply on myself. After more than a year of relatively practical study, I seem to have understood a lot. Looking back, yesterday's me is extremely ashamed and regretful. It is because of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's magnanimity and benevolence that this session I was nominated as a member again, which really moved me and excited me.

The convening of the second National Committee of the Political Consultative Conference is of great significance at a time when we are in the third year of our first five-year construction plan and are actively working to liberate Taiwan. In the future: first, I am willing to continue to study Marxism-Leninism diligently, truly reform myself, and not let down Chairman Mao's kindness in treating diseases and being benevolent to people; second, I am willing to follow the Political Consultative Conference colleagues and fellow delegates to make efforts in the construction of the country and the issue of liberating Taiwan. I still ask everyone for more guidance.

Chairman and fellow delegates,

Our conference should respond to the call of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao with actual actions, strengthen unity, and strive for the extremely glorious and great cause of socialism. We wholeheartedly support the reports proposed by this conference and the constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

When we think about the great task before us, everyone is concerned about the healthier growth of the younger generation and the issue of strengthening the education of communist moral qualities among the broad masses of young people. Therefore, I will briefly talk about this issue.

Everyone knows: Chairman Mao's instructions to the youth are to have a good body, good studies, and good work. The great Communist Party of China has always extremely valued the growth of communist morality among the youth. Our party regards cultivating the spirit of serving the motherland and the people among the youth as the primary problem of caring for and educating the youth. Due to the leadership and education of the party, during the revolutionary years, Chinese youth were brave and active, together with the people of the entire nation, overthrowing the evil rule of the reactionaries and defeating the aggression of American imperialism. In these few years, due to the education of the party, the young generation of the new China is full of vigor and vitality, striving forward, and contributing their strength to the construction of socialism. Undoubtedly, this high-quality spirit of bravely struggling for the motherland and the people will continue to be carried forward among the youth. Chinese youth will definitely, together with the people of the entire nation, completely eliminate the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, liberate Taiwan, and definitely play a greater role in the great cause of socialist construction, and can definitely ensure that the great cause we have created will have a reliable guarantee.

However, we must also see that among a small number of young people, there are still phenomena of lax discipline and moral decay. Recently, under the guidance of the party, we have exposed some bad phenomena among the youth. Then someone asked: these phenomena are rare, why make such a big fuss. We say, our country cares for every young person, we hope that every young person will not be infected with bad thoughts and habits, we must not be complacent and negligent because of the smallness of these phenomena. Someone else asked: why are there bad behaviors among the youth of the new China. We say, the bad influences left over from the old society cannot be eliminated overnight, and today, some remnants of the old society are still seducing young people to commit crimes; the old society has left behind many pornographic books and magazines, and vulgar entertainment venues, these things seduce young people to fall. At the same time, the decadent and corrupt thoughts of the bourgeoisie also have a corrosive effect on the youth. Therefore, we must be indignant and resolutely fight against all thoughts and behaviors that poison the physical and mental health of young people and harm the cause of socialism.

But the Youth League has not done enough in cultivating the communist moral qualities of the youth, and we are striving to correct this shortcoming. We must educate the youth league members and the youth to always put the interests of the state, the people, and the public above personal interests, and use their greatest strength to serve the people and public affairs. We must educate every league member and youth to establish the concept of labor and collectivism, cultivate a simple and frugal lifestyle, cherish public property, and model the government's policies and laws, daring to fight against all phenomena that harm the interests of the people. We must strive to require all league members to set an example and train themselves to become advanced warriors of communism. We must better care for the youth's learning and life, and regard these works as an important part of communist education for the youth.

But strengthening the communist education of the youth is a long-term and meticulous work, which must rely on the joint efforts of the entire society. Here, I would like to especially talk about the issue of parents educating their children. There is no parent who does not care for their children, but some parents do not know how to correctly treat their children. Some people, citing busy work, think that children also have schools to manage, so they can be indifferent and irresponsible. Some people do not pay attention to educating their children to study hard and work hard, but only care about their children dressing well and eating well, raising them to be lazy and enjoy the fruits of others' labor. Some people, when their children are infected with bad habits and do bad things, not only do not educate and stop them, but adopt an attitude of indulgence and protection. Such treatment of children will have a very bad ideological influence on the young generation and bring harm to the cause of socialism. Therefore, we require these parents, for the sake of the interests of the state and the people, and for the sake of their children's future, to correctly treat their children.

The stories of historical heroes, especially the stories of revolutionary history, revolutionary leaders, and revolutionary heroes, have a great role in cultivating the communist moral qualities of the youth. We would like to appeal to the writers again: create more and better such works to educate our country's nearly 200 million lovely youth and teenagers.

We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the care of the entire society, the communist education of the youth will be greatly strengthened. The youth will grow up as the strong generation of socialism, as the reliable successors of our great cause, as hoped by the revolutionary forerunners and the people of the entire nation, and will hold high the banner of communism to the final victory.

Chairman and fellow delegates,

I fully support Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report. Based on the five major tasks of the Political Consultative Conference pointed out by Vice Chairman Zhou in the report, I believe that our most important task is to unite the people of the entire country, implement the total tasks of the transitional period, and speed up the socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of the country; at the same time, support peace and oppose aggression, and fight for the liberation of our sacred territory of Taiwan. Now I would like to express some of my personal opinions on the issue of liberating Taiwan.

Recently, the American aggressors signed the so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, attempting to indefinitely occupy Taiwan and interfere with the Chinese people's exercise of their sovereignty. This blatant act of occupying Chinese territory and interfering with Chinese internal affairs is a shameless violation of international law and international customs. This is exactly the same as the "September 18th Incident" when Japanese imperialism supported the puppet Puyi to occupy our Northeast.

The American aggressors signed this illegal treaty with the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek to threaten us with war, obstructing the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, and attempting to further expand the aggression war. I would like to point out that the warmongers of the United States have made a grave mistake. They should know that the Chinese people have stood up after years of imperialist aggression and oppression, and have gone through countless struggles of resistance. Therefore, we have the richest experience in resisting various tricks and deceits of imperialist aggression. Such tricks and deceits cannot deceive us, nor can they frighten us. We firmly support peace, but we deeply know that yielding to the aggressors will only bring greater aggression. The warmongers of the United States should understand that the Chinese people do not say what they cannot do, and what they say they will definitely do. When the American aggressors invaded Korea and threatened our security, we said we could not stand idly by, and the American aggressors certainly remember that the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army perfectly executed this statement. As for the issue of Taiwan, as a sovereign state, we absolutely cannot tolerate anyone dividing our territorial sovereignty. Therefore, we must liberate Taiwan, which is something that no force can stop.

If the warmongers of the United States close their eyes and do not want to see the great changes in China in the five years since liberation, they will definitely be punished by history. Five years is not a long time, but the new China is completely different from the old China. Our industry, agriculture, transportation, and other sectors have not only been restored but have also developed rapidly. Our People's Liberation Army has grown into an invincible force with high political awareness and modern military technology. Especially the people of all ethnic groups, classes, and parties in the country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, inspired by the great goal of building socialism, have united like steel. In recent years, I have seen many moving things in various places, many things that ordinary people think are impossible, we have done. Many ordinary people have done extraordinary things. Those who originally had abilities now have greater abilities, and those who originally had no abilities have also become able. In the new society, people's talents have been fully utilized, and everyone can fully exert their strength to make a contribution to the people. For example, I have seen many old engineers who, in the old society, read all the scientific and technological books of various countries, but when they were old, they had no opportunity to be an engineer. Now everywhere there are great projects waiting for them, and they have completed huge water gates and one of the world's famous reinforced concrete arch dams. I have also seen many new people emerging in the work, who were outsiders last year and are now insiders proficient in their business this year. The passionate enthusiasm for building the motherland makes the wisdom hidden in the hearts of the people burst forth with dazzling brilliance. In addition, there are also criminals undergoing labor reform, and I have the opportunity to often see them. They are not emaciated and spiritless, but are strong and healthy, working. The strangest thing is that some criminals, in the open fields with roads in all directions, no longer need to be guarded, and some criminals, after their sentences are up, do not want to leave, just changing their identity as criminals, continue to work there. If the psychology of criminals is like this, then the close combination of the people of the entire nation with the government, strong unity, is even more needless to say. During the period of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in 1931, when the water level of the Yangtze River in Wuhan reached 26.94 meters, it burst and flooded; this year, the water level of the Yangtze River in Wuhan reached 29.73 meters, but it did not burst. But this only shows the results, and it cannot show the power of the people in this dangerous struggle. The fact is this: on more than 100 kilometers of the embankment, the water level is much higher than the top of the embankment, and if it overflows, 80,100 cubic meters of flow (that is, 80,100 tons of water per second), 3.7 meters of water head, will rush down like a herd of horses and cannot be resisted. The people of Wuhan City faced such a dangerous situation, and had to build an embankment to block the water in a place where it was difficult to get soil, to fight a prolonged battle with the continuously rising water level. Finally, after 56 days of struggle, they finally defeated the flood. According to common sense, this is something that cannot be done, but we did it. This cannot be said to be a miracle, this miracle fully shows the ability and power of the people of the new China to deal with unexpected events. If the American aggressors do not see these facts, do not see the invincible courage, wisdom, and power within the liberated Chinese people, and dare to invade such a powerful country, they will only have a future of failure waiting for them.

The liberation of Taiwan is our unwavering resolve, but of course, we still need to do a lot of work to complete this task. We, the members of the National Committee of the Political Consultative Conference, are all convinced that the power of the people is great, and the desire for peace is universal. Therefore, we have the responsibility to let the world know: between countries, only mutual respect for territorial and sovereign integrity and non-interference in internal affairs can truly maintain peace. Therefore, our liberation of Taiwan is to defend peace. Some people who follow the aggressive policies of the United States deliberately distort right and wrong, thinking that maintaining the status quo and allowing the American aggressors to occupy Taiwan for a long time can ease international tensions. This is a vicious deception. We must expose it and truly tell the people of the world who love peace about our desire for peace and our just cause. The Chinese revolution has gone through many twists and turns to find this one correct path today. Our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, has achieved unprecedented unity, and the construction cause is thriving. In international affairs, we, with the demeanor of a great power and the power of justice, adhere to the policy of peaceful diplomacy, inspiring the hope of the oppressed people of the world. All of this is a fact that the Chinese people have only dreamed of but never seen in the past hundred years. Now we have built such a great and beloved motherland, and compatriots at home and abroad feel proud of it. Therefore, we have the responsibility to unite and mobilize all Chinese people at home and abroad who love their country to contribute their strength to liberate Taiwan, oppose American imperialist aggression, and build a socialist motherland. Our people's democratic united front has a broad foundation. In the struggle against internal and external enemies, the door of revolution is open to all patriots. All those who oppose the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and the aggression of American imperialism should unite closely around the Communist Party of China, firmly and closely, and strive for the construction of a socialist motherland, the liberation of Taiwan, and the defense of world peace.

Finally, I propose that the conference unanimously pass the work report by Vice Chairman Chen Chutong and the constitution of the People's Political Consultative Conference.

Chairman and fellow delegates,

I fully agree with Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice Chairman Chen Chutong's work report, and Commissioner Zhang Bogong's explanation of the draft constitution. Today, I would like to talk about the issue of unorganized youth in cities. In cities, in addition to the youth in schools, factories, institutions, the military, and shops, there are still quite a number of youth who are unorganized, such as young housewives, young street vendors, young craftsmen, and some youth who have not gone to school or found employment. In Tianjin, the total number of youth is 600,000, and it is estimated that there are 300,000 unorganized youth; the ratio in Shanghai is even greater, with a total of 1.4 million youth, and it is estimated that there are 800,000 unorganized youth. Due to the continuous influx of rural youth into cities and other reasons, it is estimated that the number of unorganized youth in various places will continue to increase. They generally have a lower level of education and lack specialized skills. However, like all youth, they also yearn for learning, seek progress; they hope to contribute their strength in the socialist construction of the country. Similarly, they also want to participate in various social activities and seek rich and varied cultural lives.

Youth are a main force and reserve army for the socialist construction of the motherland. The number of unorganized youth in cities is so large that we should care for them, educate them, help them learn politics, culture, and technology, especially cultivate their moral qualities, so that they can gradually participate in the construction work of the motherland. If we do not do this, a large part of them will easily be corrupted by bourgeois ideology and seduced by hooligans and bad people, leading to corruption and degeneration. This will not only be detrimental to the construction of the motherland but will also disrupt social order. Therefore, we must pay attention to this issue.

Under the leadership and support of the Communist Party and the people's government, the All-China Youth Federation has done some work in uniting and educating unorganized urban youth in recent years. In many cities, we have mobilized and organized some unorganized youth to participate in various social reform movements, the movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea, the promotion of universal suffrage and the constitution, street work, and various social services. We have conducted various political, cultural, and scientific and technological education through self-study groups, newspaper reading groups, lectures, symposiums, and other forms. We have also organized and helped them carry out cultural, entertainment, and sports activities, so that they can develop normally in both body and mind. Although this is the case, our work scope is still very narrow, and we have not been able to unite the majority of unorganized youth. The activities we have organized are generally not diverse enough, not lively enough, and cannot closely combine with the characteristics of youth, and still cannot attract a wider range of unorganized youth to participate. Therefore, we must strive to obtain more support and help from society in the future, and improve our work. We hope that relevant departments will assist us in doing this work.

We hope that various cultural, scientific, and sports social organizations in various places will absorb as many unorganized urban youth as possible to participate in various activities, or specially organize various activities for them, such as various lectures, symposiums, discussion meetings, garden parties, visits, and travel; and as much as possible help them organize sports teams, choirs, and drama troupes. We also hope that the residents' committees in various places will set up youth committees or youth commissioners to manage the work of unorganized youth, mobilize them to participate in various social activities and voluntary labor, and help them organize various study groups and cultural and sports activities.

We hope that libraries, cultural centers, and cultural stations in various places will provide as much convenience as possible for the broad masses of unorganized youth, organize them to read books and newspapers, guide their cultural and entertainment activities; radio stations in various places will specially organize programs for them, help them learn, and organize them to listen; various publishers will publish more popular books and magazines to help them self-study; writers and artists will write and draw more works that suit their interests and are beneficial.

We hope that the cultural and educational departments in various places will strengthen the leadership and management of private supplementary schools, urge them to improve the quality of education, so that unorganized youth can truly learn the knowledge and technology necessary to participate in the construction of the motherland in supplementary schools.

We hope that the parents of the youth will care for the daily life and study of their children, especially pay attention to cultivating their moral qualities, so that their body and mind can develop normally.

Uniting and educating unorganized youth in cities is a very broad and complex work, but it is also a very important work. We believe that with the care, assistance, and supervision of all parties, we will definitely be able to do this work well, so that the broad masses of unorganized youth in cities can contribute their strength in the socialist construction of the motherland.

Chairman and fellow delegates,

I have listened to Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report and felt the need to cite a few recent facts from the local level to prove that this report will be firmly supported by the people.

First, regarding the supply of grain in rural areas. The floods in Hebei Province this year were quite serious. To combine the policy of saving grain and rationing with the policy of unified purchase and sale, the Hebei Provincial People's Government called on the people of the entire province to save grain and proposed to set different grain supply figures for different regions such as disaster areas, non-disaster areas, mountainous areas, and economic crop areas. This was proposed based on the needs of people's lives. At that time, we discussed whether it would be enough to eat. Young and strong people might not have enough to eat, but old people, women, and children would not be able to finish it. By distributing it evenly, everyone would have enough to eat. Because Hebei rural areas mostly use vegetables, sweet potatoes, and other foods as supplementary foods, combined with the supplied grain, it would be enough to eat. I have been to a few townships and asked about the amount of grain supply and whether it was enough to eat. The villagers said: with supplementary foods, the grain supplied by the state would be enough to eat. The government, on the one hand, allocated grain and transported it to the disaster areas to ensure the grain supply for the disaster victims; on the other hand, encouraged the people to save grain and be prepared for disasters. This is the real situation in Hebei rural areas regarding grain.

Second, the government lends money to the people to encourage the development of sideline industries and self-reliant production. For example, in the water town of Baiyangdian, Anxin County, the people earn more than 10 billion yuan a year just from weaving mats and making reed bags; in Quxian County, the mountainous area, women earn more than 100 billion yuan a year from making shoe soles in winter and spring. Various counties have 13 to 40 kinds of sideline industries, and just weaving cloth in rural areas, each person can earn 3,000 to 5,000 yuan a day. The people just need to be willing to work, and there will be no one who cannot eat their fill. The government provides relief for the elderly, the weak, the orphans, the disabled, and those without labor power. But there are a few who have labor power but do not want to work, do not want to produce, and have difficulty living, relying on government relief to eat, which is not appropriate and is not agreed upon by the masses.

Third, the masses have a good understanding of the unified purchase and sale policy and enthusiastically support it. On the afternoon of November 26th, at 3:30 PM, we passed through the village of Xianliu in Jixian County and saw more than 20 horse-drawn carts parading, each cart loaded with more than ten large bags of grain, and the sellers, mostly women, and some old people, were all wearing flowers given by the masses. The villagers and students lined the streets cheering: "Sell surplus grain to the state! Support the liberation of Taiwan! Support the policy of unified purchase and sale!" We also saw that many of the grain transport carts to the county warehouses had flags with such slogans.

Title: Speech at the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

Chairman and fellow delegates,

I previously participated in the fake government of Chiang Kai-shek and took the wrong path of opposing the people. Today, I am honored to speak at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, and I feel both honored and apprehensive.

I have committed grave crimes against the people in the past. Recently, I have publicly confessed to the nation, and I deeply regret my past actions. Today, I would like to report on my thought process of turning towards the people.

In 1948, I resigned from the position of the fake Executive Yuan. I began to consider the prospect of the Communist Party liberating the nation. At that time, my thoughts were divided between public and private interests. On the private side, I had been part of the reactionary government for too long and had deeply wronged the people, causing me to feel great fear. On the public side, I felt that the actions and policies of the fake government of Chiang Kai-shek were indeed harmful to the people and the nation. The Communist Party saved China from its dire straits and brought it out of chaos, which was a highly welcome event. In this mental state, I felt that even to save myself from a miserable fate, I should not continue on the reactionary path.

From 1949 to 1950, to avoid interference from the fake government in Taiwan, I resided in Paris. At that time, I observed the world situation and saw that on one hand, the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union had either eliminated or was in the process of eliminating the exploiting classes and was seriously building and advancing, like the rising sun. On the other hand, the imperialist countries, with monopolistic capitalists in power, oppressed the working people at home and plundered and exploited abroad. China had suffered cruel oppression from imperialism for over a hundred years. The fake government of Chiang Kai-shek was selfish and reactionary, willingly selling out the country, making imperialism even more aggressive against China. Fortunately, China was liberated, and the new government led by the working class was established, providing a great opportunity for China's independence and self-reliance. I had been a helper of Chiang Kai-shek, indeed taking the wrong path of opposing the country and the people. I must change my ways and return to the country, correct my past mistakes, and strive for the opportunity to redeem my sins.

However, making this decision was not simple or easy. I had been listed as a war criminal by the people. Returning to the country, I could not help but have some concerns about my safety. In Paris, I was under surveillance by the fake embassy, and it was difficult to obtain a permit from the British government to pass through Hong Kong. The Americans tried to bribe me, inviting me to the U.S. and offering me financial incentives. Such obstacles and temptations all came to shake my resolve. My conclusion was that I could not be afraid of difficulties and could not accept temptations. At this critical juncture, I must firmly carry out my plan to turn from darkness to light, only then could I do right by my country. Therefore, I made up my mind and flew back.

I have been living in the capital, Beijing, for nearly four years now. Unexpectedly, the people have been very lenient with me. During this period, I have worked on translating works related to geology without any restrictions or constraints. Now, I am honored to be invited as a member of the second National Committee of the People's Political Consultative Conference, which makes me see that the people of our country are opening a path of repentance and self-reform for those who have previously gone astray. As long as one sincerely loves the country and is not afraid of having no way out, one can turn towards the people. I have received such lenient treatment, which has strengthened my resolve to work for the people to atone for my past sins.

In the four years since my return to the country, I have seen many phenomena of the new China after liberation, which have allowed me to understand the truth and see with my own eyes the great task of eliminating the old and establishing the new, building a socialist society under the leadership of the working class.

From my personal experience in geology and economics, I have worked in geology for many years. Although I lacked leadership, I could not promote it; but the previous reactionary governments only sought to oppress and exploit the people and did not value science at all. They treated geological institutions, like other scientific institutions, as unimportant decorations. Therefore, there were very few geologists, and although they worked hard, they were not valued. Now, everything is different. Under the people's democratic system, the number of geologists has increased significantly, and drilling and exploration work has been fully promoted. Under the leadership of the Geological Bureau, with a focus and plan, based on advanced Soviet experience, progress has been made, achieving significant results far beyond the previous stagnant situation. Moreover, due to the annual progress of the construction plan, the geological sector still needs more personnel and more exploration, which is being developed in increasing quantities, truly providing basic data for construction work.

When I participated in the fake government of Chiang Kai-shek, I was particularly concerned about China's economy. At that time, it was the era of bureaucratic capitalism. Especially the Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen families used their power to seize wealth, amass property, and become a special stratum that controlled power, causing the national economy to shake at its roots and the people's lives to become increasingly impoverished. At that time, I was deeply moved by this situation. Looking back now, I myself was also a member of the bureaucratic capitalist clique, trapped in it, and was no different. After liberation, through thorough reform, the landlord class has been eliminated by land reform, and the enterprises of national capitalists are also being transformed in the process of development. The socialist economic component has taken the lead, laying the foundation for the socialist economy of the new China. On such a foundation, we can truly achieve real results in national construction. From this, it can be seen that the so-called construction of the fake government was just a cover for exploiting the people and selling out the country, with no meaning other than self-deception and deceiving others. Therefore, I deeply feel that my economic work in the fake government was indeed of an anti-country and anti-people nature.

From this, it can be seen that the nature of the government is fundamentally related. The government centered around Chiang Kai-shek, regardless of whether it was "tutelage" or "constitutionalism," was essentially a fascist dictatorship. The goal of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship was for his personal position, the interests of the bureaucratic comprador class, and his power to suppress the people. Such a government would naturally be willing to help and collude with any imperialist country. Because he could not succeed in colluding with Japanese imperialism, he knelt down and surrendered to American imperialism, acting even more obsequiously. Such behavior was undoubtedly a treacherous policy of harming the country and the people. Now, the traitorous clique has fled to Taiwan. Apart from this, the vast territory has returned to the people, freeing itself from the shackles of imperialism, and the humiliation accumulated over a hundred years has been swept away. China has truly achieved independence and self-reliance, and its international status has risen to an unprecedented height, showing the superiority of the people's democratic system. We must jointly support it. What is regrettable is that the traitorous clique in Taiwan is inciting the United States to launch a crazy attack on the motherland. We must strengthen our efforts to resist aggression and defend our territory, liberate Taiwan, and eliminate the traitorous clique.

In summary, during my time of returning to the motherland, all phenomena have made me see that China has been able to revive because of its liberation, and because it can resist imperialism, it can maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Because it is advancing towards socialism, it can achieve success in construction. The reason for such progress is that it relies on the leadership of the working class, advancing towards the goal indicated by Marxism-Leninism. In this transitional period, it is even more necessary to unite as one, under the leadership of the Communist Party, correct our stance, and through the reform movement, advance towards a socialist society. Like me, who has previously taken the wrong political path, we must firmly resolve to seriously study and use new knowledge to eliminate the remnants of my old thoughts. I know that my political knowledge is extremely backward, and my understanding of socialism is still insufficient. I must resolutely and persistently study to catch up with the times after liberation. I will definitely reform myself, respect the people, and serve the country to fulfill my responsibility to the motherland.

Fellow delegates, we have entered the bright era from the old era of the old government's rule, and we cannot help but compare the current situation with the past. We clearly see that the good practices and great achievements in politics, economics, and culture today are impossible under the rule of the old government. We must support the people's democratic system led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive towards the socialist goal. We are still in the transitional period, and the exploiting elements still need to be gradually eliminated. The non-socialist economic forces still need to be actively transformed, and the old feudal backward thoughts have not been completely eliminated. American imperialism and the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek are still attacking us. In such a situation, we have even more reason to redouble our efforts. I am willing to contribute my humble efforts, together with all the delegates, to strengthen our work on the united front of the people's democracy, and strive together to build a strong and prosperous socialist society as soon as possible.

Title: The People's Daily, Second Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
Author:

People from the disaster-stricken areas said: "Chairman Mao truly has foresight. This year, with such a severe flood, if it were not for the unified procurement and marketing, those with grain would not sell, and those without grain would just stare helplessly. How many people would have starved to death!"

This shows that the state's grain policy has been deeply understood and enthusiastically supported by the people.

Fourth Point: The consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship and the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives. When we set out from Baoding on October 28 to inspect the flood and water conservancy, it was precisely the time when Hebei Province was implementing the three tasks of unified procurement and marketing. County officials were studying day and night, calculating and allocating procurement quotas, and preparing to successfully complete their assigned tasks. Village officials and the masses have exerted their utmost efforts in flood prevention work during the rainy season; prefectural and county magistrates personally led the river works, and all officials have made hard struggle their habit. In the recent period, I visited 25 counties, 10 districts, and 6 townships, traveling over 3,000 miles of rural roads. Everywhere I saw social order stable and peaceful, with carts and carriages coming and going in great numbers. Whether in the mountains or by the sea, whether in the early morning or at night, we proceeded very safely and confidently, never encountering any quarrels or disturbances to public order.

In the past, many people in the rural areas of Hebei wore patched and torn clothes. Now, after traveling through so many places, I have only seen five people wearing mended clothes. On the morning of November 11, we rode a horse-drawn carriage to Ding County, 30 miles south of the city, to inspect the ditch system at Dingcao Store. Along the way, we saw a large cotton field with 14 or 15 women dressed in red and green floral cloth and 6 or 7 men in neat blue uniforms, standing in a somewhat orderly row, picking cotton. They worked while chatting, singing, and laughing. This beautiful scene fully demonstrated the people's enthusiasm for the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives. These situations have been encountered a few times in individual counties, which are things that could not be imagined or seen in the old society. Ding County has developed to 2,800 agricultural producers' cooperatives, accounting for 48% of the total number of households. There are 117 villages where the entire village is organized, meaning that the people in 117 villages have completely joined the cooperative. The Zhoujiagang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Jin County has a tractor station, a well-drilling team, a brick kiln, a mill, a health station, a nursery, a drama troupe, a club, a radio, and a film projector. On weekends, there are dance parties, blackboard newspapers, criticism, and praise. The entire cooperative has a population of 2,000 and not a single illiterate. This shows that the socialist transformation and development of agriculture is progressing rapidly, with a thousand-mile-a-day momentum. In Rao County, due to the heavy rains and flood diversion this year, several villages were submerged. The disaster-stricken people said: "It is better to flood Rao County than the six or seven counties north of the dike." In the summer, the fourth district of Xingle County, Hantai Town, dug ditches to drain water and relieve flooding. An elderly farmer, Li Laozhong, voluntarily sacrificed his fields and trees to reduce public flooding. They were able to solve problems with the spirit of subordinating personal interests to the greater good.

From these situations alone, it is enough to show that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the political awareness of the people has been raised, and the socialist transformation in rural areas has developed; it also shows that the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship is more consolidated. This obviously proves that the report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai fully meets the people's demands and will be wholeheartedly supported by the people.

At the same time, Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's analysis of the current international situation in his political report and his firm statement that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan are fully supported by me. Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai also pointed out that ideological reform must be repeatedly carried out, and I believe this is the best method for studying Marxism-Leninism.

Finally, I express my agreement with the work report of Vice Chairman Chen Chutong on behalf of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the explanation by Commissioner Zhang Boqun on the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, hoping that it will be promptly adopted and implemented.

Chen Dongyuan, Member of the Committee:

I am a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner and have always been interested in studying acupuncture. In the past, under the old society, I was discriminated against by the reactionary ruling class. Today, I am able to participate in the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, feeling very honored and excited. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for their warm concern and support.

During this conference, I listened to the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, as well as the work report of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I fully agree with these reports and explanations and am willing to strictly follow them.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the people's government has united the strength of all sectors of the country, promoted democratic spirit, and carried out large-scale economic construction on a grand scale. Therefore, any undertaking and any department fully demonstrate a thriving new atmosphere. This is worth our joy and excitement.

I have heard more than once from the central leaders about the call to develop the functions of traditional Chinese medicine to strengthen health work. We know that acupuncture has been in existence since ancient times in our country. Before liberation, during the reactionary rule, due to their corruption and incompetence, science and technology did not develop, and our country's precious medical heritage—traditional Chinese medicine, especially acupuncture, has always been despised and suppressed. After liberation, the Party and the government issued a call to value traditional Chinese medicine, changing people's perception of traditional Chinese medicine; coupled with the government's widespread promotion of public health work, the establishment of joint clinics and health stations, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine jointly shouldered the honorable task of protecting the people's health.

Liberating Taiwan is a sacred cause of the entire nation. We traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should actively support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with the attitude of masters of the country and shoulder the honorable task of saving the sick and injured without hesitation.

We medical workers must further unite and resolutely, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, support the front line and support the socialist construction of the motherland, and strive for the liberation of Taiwan, the completion of the socialist construction of the motherland, and the completion of the glorious historical mission of the Chinese people.

Zhang Xiuzhu, Member of the Committee:

I fully agree with Vice Chairman Chen Chutong's report on the work of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report. The Chinese working class will strive to thoroughly implement the tasks proposed in these reports.

The First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has successfully completed its historical mission. Now, the task facing the various nationalities, classes, parties, and people's organizations in China is to further consolidate the unity of the Chinese people, further consolidate the united front of the people's democracy, mobilize the Chinese people, and successfully build our great motherland into a great socialist country. This great goal and the path that must be followed to achieve this goal have already been stipulated in our country's constitution. The Chinese working class will, together with the Chinese people, strive to achieve this great goal.

Due to the development of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country in recent years, the foundation of the united front of the people's democracy has become stronger, and the unity of the Chinese people has become more consolidated. The unity of the Chinese working class, the unity of workers and peasants, and the unity of the Chinese people are of great significance to the socialist construction and socialist transformation of our country, to the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, and to the liberation of Taiwan. Trade union organizations are willing to exert their active role in the cause of national unity.

In the past few years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, trade union organizations have faithfully followed the common program formulated by the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During the period of national economic recovery, they organized and mobilized the working class to overcome various difficulties with selfless labor, together with the Chinese people, to complete the tasks of the recovery period, and to support the great struggle of resisting America and aiding Korea.

Now our country has entered the period of socialist construction and socialist transformation. In this period, the most important and fundamental task of trade union organizations is to organize mass labor competitions, organize and help workers learn advanced technology, fully mobilize the initiative and creativity of the working class, and comprehensively complete the national economic construction plan. At the same time, trade union organizations and the broad masses of workers also pay attention to their responsibilities in the cause of socialist transformation. The broad masses of workers, while striving to complete the national plan, know that their efforts are also a help to the peasants, and also know that their achievements in the construction cause are inseparable from the labor of the peasants and all working people.

In the cause of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, our trade union organizations are also striving to play a certain role. Many capitalist enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people, with the strong support of the government and the active help of the working class, have already taken the path of state capitalism. These enterprises have generally shown new vitality in production, and management has also improved to some extent. It must be admitted that many capitalists are willing to accept socialist transformation and have already begun to accept it. They are law-abiding. However, there are also some capitalists who, after the "Five Anti" campaign, after the publication of the general line for the transitional period, and after the First National People's Congress has formulated and promulgated the constitution, still adopt a passive and slack attitude towards production, and still have behaviors such as tax evasion, shoddy work, capital flight, wage arrears, and even inciting workers to oppose the government. Please allow me to say frankly that these behaviors are detrimental to the cause of socialist transformation, detrimental to the cause of the state and the people, and even detrimental to these capitalists themselves. This is detrimental to unity. We hope these capitalists will change this attitude.

The transformation of capitalist industry and commerce must reform its management methods. Without the assistance and supervision of the working class, the reform of management methods cannot be carried out smoothly. Therefore, the task of trade union organizations and workers in capitalist industry and commerce is to actively assist capitalists in improving management, increasing production, improving quality, and reducing costs; at the same time, they should also supervise capitalists to correctly implement the government's policies, laws, and regulations, and respect the legitimate rights of workers, through the path of state capitalism, to complete the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Of course, it should also be admitted that a few workers in capitalist enterprises also have the phenomenon of not working hard and not observing labor discipline. We trade union organizations will continue to educate these workers and further change this situation.

Comrades, when we are holding this meeting to further unite and build our motherland, the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique have already signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty," attempting to permanently occupy our country's territory—Taiwan. The actions of the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are not only a serious provocation to the Chinese people but also a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world. The broad masses of workers have expressed their boundless indignation at the aggressive actions of American imperialism. The trade union organizations and workers of China fully support the statement made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on December 8, 1954, regarding the Sino-American "Mutual Defense Treaty." The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and the Chinese working class will exert its utmost efforts to support and participate in the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

Jie Chaoding, Member of the Committee:

I fully support Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report.

Since the Geneva Conference, the international situation has basically eased, and international trade has had the possibility of returning to normal. However, the United States, unwilling to accept the failure of its aggressive policy in Asia, not only organized the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Collective" and signed the so-called Sino-American "Mutual Defense Treaty," but also instructed the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to continue their rampant activities of intercepting merchant ships, looting cargo, and detaining crew members, which are outrageous and unreasonable acts of disrupting the freedom of navigation on the high seas.

The United States' actions to disrupt international economic exchanges have been going on for a long time. As early as 1951, under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations illegally passed the so-called "embargo" resolution against our country; following that, the U.S. Congress passed the so-called "Batt" bill, using the threat of stopping "American aid" to force countries receiving "American aid" to sever normal trade relations with our country and other peaceful democratic countries under the pretext of embargoing "strategic materials."

The ruling class of the United States is trying to use these means to strangle our country's peaceful economy, disrupt the construction of peaceful democratic countries, in order to monopolize the world market and raw materials, and grab the maximum profits, and also trying to shift its increasingly mature economic crisis onto other countries and peoples.

However, since the implementation of the "embargo" and other discriminatory measures, our country's economy has not only not been strangled but has rapidly recovered and developed; our foreign trade has not only not been reduced but has been continuously expanding. Our country has established a solid economic mutual assistance and cooperation relationship with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, forming a new and increasingly powerful and prosperous democratic world market. Our country has also successively developed trade relations with more than fifty countries in the capitalist world, many of which have signed trade agreements, protocols, and payment agreements with our country.

Facts have proven that the "embargo" and other discriminatory measures have not achieved their goals and have suffered a complete failure. However, for the countries forced to implement the "embargo" measures, they have lost the opportunity to engage in economic exchanges with the democratic world market, thereby deepening their domestic economic difficulties. The ruling class of the United States takes advantage of this difficulty, using "American aid" as bait, to tighten control over these countries receiving "American aid," making them not only not receive aid but also lose their independence.

From this, it can be seen that the "embargo" and other discriminatory policies have caused great losses and difficulties in the countries implementing them, and have aroused strong dissatisfaction among the peoples of these countries. Therefore, they are demanding to restore and develop normal trade relations with our country and other peaceful democratic countries.

Our government has always advocated developing normal trade relations with any country on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Since the Geneva Conference, the trade agreements or protocols signed between our country and countries such as India, Burma, Indonesia, and Ceylon have proven that countries with different social and economic systems can coexist peacefully, exchange goods, and restore and develop normal trade relations.

As a peace-loving worker, I fully support the government's measures to develop normal international trade relations and am willing to exert my full strength to assist the government in implementing these measures.

The ruling class of the United States has exposed its outrageous and unreasonable nature of aggression in disrupting normal international trade relations to the people of the world; while our efforts to develop normal international trade relations have been supported by the peace-loving people of the world. Therefore, the struggle to develop normal international trade and friendly relations will inevitably achieve complete victory.

Ye Yutian, Member of the Committee:

I am very honored and excited to participate in the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

I fully support and agree with the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, the work report by Vice Chairman Chen Chutong, and the explanation by Commissioner Zhang Boqun on the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

The preamble of the constitution points out: "In the future, in mobilizing and uniting the Chinese people to complete the state's transitional period tasks and the struggle against internal and external enemies, the united front of the people's democracy in our country will continue to play its role." The national bourgeoisie, as a member of the united front of the people's democracy, must make certain contributions to the state and the people. However, it is undeniable that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the working class, and under the premise of accepting socialist transformation, can such contributions be possible.

Since the state's transitional period tasks have been clearly defined, the private industry and commerce in Xi'an have received guidance and care from local party and government departments and are gradually moving towards the path of state capitalism in a healthy and step-by-step manner. By the end of October this year, the number of industrial households accepting processing and procurement has reached 45% of the total number of industrial households in the city; the number of commercial households accepting wholesale, retail, and agency sales for state-owned commerce has reached 20% of the total number of commercial households in the city. Most of the wholesalers who have lost their function have turned to industries beneficial to the national economy and the people, with a total turnover of 580 billion yuan and 2,000 people changing jobs. There are 17 public-private joint ventures, mostly large factories. This shows that the transformation of private industry and commerce is possible, and the national bourgeoisie is willing to accept the transformation. However, we must also admit that there are still a few backward-minded private industrialists and businessmen who resist socialist transformation with behaviors such as wasteful spending, capital flight, shoddy work, and passive management. This requires us to strengthen ideological education and personal transformation to overcome the wrong thoughts and actions in the business community.

The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, in collusion with American imperialism, has occupied our sacred territory—Taiwan. Recently, they have signed the so-called Sino-American "Mutual Defense Treaty," attempting to expand the war of aggression and threaten the security of our territory, and obstruct our socialist construction. We sincerely support the solemn statement by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and will definitely give a resolute counterattack to the aggressors. I will do my best at my post, unite and mobilize private industrialists and businessmen to actively follow the leadership of the state economy, improve enterprise management, and with the practical actions of actively subscribing to national bonds and paying taxes, support the sacred struggle to liberate Taiwan.

The draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates seven items that all participating units and individuals should jointly abide by, which I believe fully conforms to the spirit of the constitution and the requirements of the state's transitional period tasks. In terms of my personal political level and work quality, there is still a great gap from the seven items. However, I have confidence and determination, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, to use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, to study hard, to continuously transform, and to strive wholeheartedly to complete the glorious tasks given to me by the conference.

Chagan Gegren, Member of the Committee:

I fully agree with and support the work report of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai.

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, has combined Marxism-Leninism with our country's specific practices, leading us to establish and consolidate the new people's democratic regime, and on this basis, held the First National People's Congress in this year, formulated the constitution, and opened up a broad road for the people to enter the long-awaited happy socialist society. We will definitely be able to enter the socialist society through this road, and the iron facts of the past few years can prove this.

The Buddha Sakyamuni taught that one should regard the affairs of the masses as more important than one's own affairs, and be kind and compassionate to people and help those in need. Buddhists who follow these teachings fully support our country's socialist construction cause. The teachings of Buddhism advocate peace, and are opposed to the enemies of the state and religion. Therefore, Buddhists are with the people of the whole country to maintain the cause of world peace and justice.

Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries discriminated against religion, destroyed temples, and spread rumors that the Communists would come to destroy religion. At the beginning of liberation, some Buddhists believed the rumors of the Kuomintang reactionaries, had insufficient understanding of the Communist Party, and still had concerns, fearing that religion would be destroyed and religious beliefs would be disrupted. But the facts of several years have proven that these concerns are unnecessary. The Common Program stipulates the policy of freedom of religious belief, and the constitution promulgated this year also specifically stipulates that people have the freedom of religious belief. Buddhists have established their own national organization—the Chinese Buddhist Association. These facts show that Buddhists living in liberated New China fully enjoy the freedom of religious belief, our beliefs are seriously respected, our lives are well taken care of, and our social status has greatly improved.

In the past few years, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups have closely united. In the struggle against American imperialist aggression and the crushing of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous remnants, great victories have been achieved. On this basis, we will further strengthen unity, strive to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and smoothly carry out the socialist construction of the state and the cause of defending world peace.

Tao Shuzeng, Member of the Committee:

I agree with the work report by Vice Chairman Chen Chutong and the explanation by Commissioner Zhang Boqun on the draft constitution, and support the political report by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, and I will abide by the seven items stipulated in the draft constitution.

Hubei Province is a serious flood-stricken area this year, and Wuhan City is a key area for flood control, which has been of long-standing concern to the commissioners. I come from Hubei and will briefly report the situation I know from participating in flood control and disaster relief work.

The areas of Hubei Province affected by the flood this year include 42 counties. The earliest time of the disaster was in early June, and by mid-August, the flood reached its peak. By early October, the disaster-stricken people began to return home. The population displaced by the disaster was approximately 4.6 million, of which one-third were relocated to other counties.

Now, most of the land submerged by the water has been reclaimed. Most of the disaster-stricken people have returned to their homes.

The flood in early June was caused by the sudden outbreak of mountain torrents in the southern mountains of Hubei and the Dabie Mountains, which had a short but highly destructive period, resulting in many casualties among people and livestock. The center of the disaster was Chongyang County and Luotian County. The flood from mid-June to July was caused by prolonged heavy rain, and all the dikes in the lake area were submerged by the accumulated water. After late July, the flood was caused by the breach of the Jianghan dikes, but this period did not significantly increase the affected area. In addition, the people's government also implemented planned flood diversion, compensating the residents of the flood diversion area. In the upper reaches of Wuhan, due to accumulated water and flood diversion, the submerged area was approximately 10,000 square kilometers. The flood diversion was planned, and the residents of the flood diversion area were relocated in an orderly manner, with no loss of life.

During the peak flood season, the central work of the province was flood control and disaster relief. Party and government cadres, except for a few who continued daily work, all participated in this central work. All tugboats, barges, and approximately 40,000 civilian ships, as well as about 40,000 auxiliary boats, were organized to participate in the work. Due to the strong cadre force and shipping capacity, all disaster-stricken people were rescued in a timely manner, and cattle were also saved to safe places using wooden rafts and large civilian ships. Disaster relief grain and shelter materials were also supplied in a timely manner.

Even the unaffected areas were mobilized extensively. Based on the education of the past five years by the Party and the people's government, the farmers in the unaffected areas fully demonstrated their spirit of mutual aid, providing shelter, land, and lending seeds, tools, and furniture to the disaster-stricken people, enabling most of the disaster-stricken people to have a place to live, work to do, and something to do.

In the early stages of the flood, there was an outbreak of epidemics, mainly dysentery. The people's government mobilized a large number of medical personnel, organized mobile medical ships and medical teams, and went deep into the epidemic-stricken areas to carry out preventive and treatment work. By early October, infectious diseases had been basically eliminated. The number of dysentery patients was reduced from 70-80% to less than 10%.

Starting from early October, the central work of the province shifted to helping the disaster-stricken people return home, rebuilding their homes, and repairing the dikes. Transportation and logistics served this purpose, transporting disaster-stricken people back home, and transporting grain, seeds, building materials, bedding, and cattle feed, as well as other living materials and production tools. Materials for repairing the dikes were also transported. Major breaches in the Jianghan dikes, such as Shangchewan on the Yangtze River, Wuzigong, and Yuhuang Palace on the Han River, were repaired by the end of November. At present, the grain reserves in the disaster-stricken areas are mostly more than two months, with each person receiving 14 taels of grain per day. Farmers participating in dike repair, transportation, road repair, and irrigation restoration projects receive an additional pound of grain per person per day.

Although Hubei is a seriously affected area, the unaffected areas are all bountiful. The main source of grain in the disaster-stricken areas is internal adjustment within the province. The amount of grain adjusted from other provinces is not large. According to my understanding, Sichuan assisted with 40,000 tons of rice, and Henan assisted with 20,000 tons. Hubei also exchanged some rice for wheat from North China.

In terms of flood control, although the flood in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River this year was the highest on record, due to the people's government's preparations based on meteorological and hydrological forecasts, the flood control battles in the three key areas of Hubei (Wuhan City, the Jingjiang Great Dike, and Huangshi City) were all victorious. The Jingjiang Great Dike is the lifeline of 5 million people, Wuhan City is the economic center of Central China, and Huangshi City is an industrial area. The victory of Wuhan's flood control not only boosted the morale of the people of the whole country but also had a significant political impact internationally. This victory made the brother countries of the democratic camp happy, made peace-loving countries and peoples admire it, and also disappointed the enemies who were glad to see the disaster.

When the water level in Wuhan was rising day by day, American imperialist newspapers kept spreading rumors that the Communists had no solution. But in the end, when Wuhan had eliminated the threat of the flood, the second-largest city in the United States, Chicago, was submerged by the flood.

The victory of Wuhan's flood control was achieved under the warm concern of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, under the direct leadership of the provincial and municipal Party committees and government, with the material support of the whole country, and with the active and selfless labor of the people of the whole city. The water level this year was 1.45 meters higher than the highest water level recorded in 1931 and 2.79 meters higher than the water level when Hankou breached in 1931. It was 0.23 meters higher than the highest dike in Wuhan, and the maximum wave height was about 2 meters higher than the dike. It remained above the warning water level for a full 100 days (1.4 to 7.7 meters higher than the ground inside the dike). The 138-kilometer-long dike, during the flood control period, underwent five phases of heightening and strengthening, with a total of 2.7 million cubic meters of earthwork, 168,000 cubic meters of stonework, 62.4 kilometers of anti-wave wooden fences. In the dike sections with strong wave force, three or four lines of anti-wave engineering were constructed. The earthwork and stonework were transported from 30 to over 300 kilometers away, 8 million burlap and straw bags, 50,000 cubic meters of fir wood, 6 million jin of reeds and sorghum stalks, 6,000 large iron anchors, 2.7 million meters of bamboo ropes, and 6,000 meters of steel wire ropes were transported from Northeast China, North China, East China, South China, and Southwest China. The quality of the dikes left over from the old society was very poor, and under the unprecedented pressure of the flood, there were more than 2,000 serious incidents. Due to the sufficient manpower and materials, strong organizational leadership, and the Party's foresight, the strengthening of the dikes was always ahead of the arrival of the flood peak. All dangers were rescued in time. The 300,000-strong flood control army all competed in labor with unparalleled enthusiasm. On July 19, a strong wind destroyed all the initial anti-wave reed fences, and more than 100,000 flood control personnel stood in the water, using their bodies to block the waves, holding on for eight hours, defending the dike. In the rescue of major dangers, dozens of soldiers and workers sacrificed their lives. Such heroic deeds are countless.

In terms of technology, the reverse filtration engineering of the dike body was created, overcoming the general seepage of the dike body, the anti-wave fence was created, overcoming the threat of waves, and these creations were all the result of engineers and workers discussing and experimenting, obtaining leadership support, and being promoted immediately. In terms of flood control intelligence, the Central Meteorological Station, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, and the South China Water Conservancy Bureau provided meteorological and hydrological forecasts, which played a guiding role in the engineering plans for each phase and the work plans for each day.

Planned flood diversion played a decisive role in the victory of flood control in the Jingjiang Great Dike, Wuhan City, and Huangshi City. The initial use of the Jingjiang flood diversion project reduced the flood peak in the Sandishi area by 7-8 inches, saving the Jingjiang Great Dike and countless lives within the dike. The flood diversion of Shangchewan on the Yangtze River, Honghu Lake, and Lu Lake may have reduced the flood peak in Wuhan by more than one meter. The two flood diversions of Liangzi Lake saved Huangshi City. Planned flood diversion not only reduced the flood peak but also gained time for the strengthening of the three key dikes. The damage to the farmers was not great. Because since April this year, the water level of the Jianghan River had been rising steadily, and by the end of April, the water level of the Jianghan River was higher than the ground level of the lake dikes. The continuous heavy rains in May, June, and July had already submerged all the lake dikes. The flood diversion only increased the depth of submersion, causing additional damage to the residents' houses and property. The people's government provided appropriate compensation and relief funds, so the farmers did not have any psychological resistance to the flood diversion. Many elderly farmers said that if it were not for the government's planned flood diversion, the disaster situation would have been expanded by several times, and many people would have been drowned.

The victory of Hubei Province's flood control and disaster relief work fully demonstrates the superiority of our country's people's democratic system, which has given the people of the whole province a great education, raised socialist awareness, and consolidated the alliance between workers and peasants. The people of the whole province, especially the people in the disaster-stricken areas, all recalled the situation of the 1931 flood, and the contrast between then and now made everyone feel the concern of the Party and the people's government, feel the loveliness of the country, and also feel their responsibility to the country. The living conditions of the people in the disaster-stricken areas are still very difficult, with too few houses, insufficient tools, and a lack of cattle, but the general production enthusiasm is high, and they have confidence in rebuilding their homes. These shortcomings are also being gradually overcome and improved. I suggest that in addition to relief and lending seeds and cash to the severely affected areas, it is also appropriate to lend cattle, tools, and iron and woodworking tools. As long as there are sufficient tools, farmers can quickly rebuild their homes.

The main reason for the unprecedented flood in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River this year is the prolonged heavy rain in the middle and lower reaches of the river basin in the summer. The rainfall in the three months of May, June, and July in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces all exceeded the average annual rainfall. The water volume coming down from Sichuan was not large. Therefore, the construction of reservoirs upstream cannot completely solve the problem of the Yangtze River flood. The plan to utilize the lakes and marshes in the middle reaches for flood storage should be considered as part of the fundamental plan. The loss of life in the Hubei flood this year was caused by the sudden outbreak of mountain torrents. In early June, the sudden rise of the flood in the southern mountains of Hubei resulted in the death of more than 400 people in Chongyang County alone. In the future, the policy of water control should focus on water and soil conservation, building more terraces, and reducing the runoff rate.

The achievements of Hubei Province and Wuhan City in flood control and disaster relief this year are great. However, there are also many shortcomings. In terms of the work I participated in, in the initial period of the disaster-stricken people returning home, the transportation and distribution of living materials were unbalanced, causing some areas to have tense situations of salt and oil shortages. The situation of coal oil being out of stock was even more widespread. The transportation tools, due to improper scheduling, have not yet played their due role.

In the flood control work in Wuhan, in the condition of ensuring safety, the saving of manpower and materials was not flexible enough, causing some dike sections to be over-strengthened and wasting manpower and materials. In scientific and technological research, even less was done. For example, the anti-wave wooden fences did not undergo various experiments; the permeability of the dike base soil, the change of groundwater with the rise and fall of the river water, and the occurrence of sand boiling in the lower layer were not arranged in advance for planned experiments and observations. In this large-scale, long-term, and arduous struggle, only some fragmented experiences were obtained, and these experiences could not be elevated to scientific theories, making them convenient for dissemination, convenient for continuous enrichment and improvement. As a new engineer in New China, he should not be satisfied with completing the task, should not be satisfied with obtaining fragmented experiences. He must, through the practice of the working class, plan to use the strength and wisdom of the working class, continuously improve the operation methods, enrich scientific theories, seek to create new operation methods, develop scientific theories, and create higher conditions for the next step of work. Upon review, the reason why I did not have much harvest in the 300,000-strong flood control army and 100 days of intense work is not only the problem of insufficient scientific and technological level, but also the insufficient understanding of the practice of the masses, the insufficient understanding of the fact that the practice of the masses is the source of science, the lack of foresight in work plans, the lack of comprehensiveness and thoroughness. The work method is only concerned with the completion of the task, neglecting the accumulation of scientific data, and failing to combine the actual experience of the masses with the research of scientific theories. In summary, it is the lack of Marxist-Leninist thinking methods and work methods.

The seventh item of the seven items stipulated in the preamble of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is more important for us scientific workers. We must strive to study Marxist-Leninist theory, take it as the basis for our academic pursuits, take it as the guiding principle for our work and actions, and take it as the standard for our ideological transformation.

Comrades, under the leadership of the Party and the people's government, the people of the whole province of Hubei have united and organized to overcome the unprecedented flood. I believe that the great power of the 600 million people of the whole country, united and organized, will definitely be able to liberate Taiwan, smash imperialist aggression, and complete the construction of a prosperous and happy socialist society.

    在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议上的发言
    翁文灏委员的发言
    主席团，各位委员！我从前参加蒋伪政权，误走了反人民的道路。今天我能在中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会席上讲话，我感觉非常光荣而且惶悚。
    我从前对人民犯重罪，近时已公开向全国人民坦白认罪，至今追想已往罪行，我自身深切痛恨。今天想报告我投向人民的思想过程。
    一九四八年我辞却伪行政院长地位，我开始考虑到共产党解放全国的前景。我当时观念是公私交战的。私的方面，我加入反动政权为时太久，对人民负罪太深，我深怀着恐惧的心理。公的方面，我觉得蒋伪政权所作所为实是殃民害国。共产党把中国从百孔千疮的绝境中挽救出来，实是极可欢迎的大事。在这样心理下，我觉得，即使为挽救自身的悲惨命运，也不应该继续走反动的道路。
    一九四九年到一九五○年，我为避免台湾伪政权的干涉，寓居巴黎。那时我观察世界形势，我看到一方面以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国，已经消灭或正在消灭剥削阶级，认真建设，向前发展，犹如旭日方升；另一方面，帝国主义各国，垄断资本家把握政权，在国内压迫劳动人民，在国外掠夺榨取。中国一百多年来受尽帝国主义的残酷欺压，蒋伪政权自私反动，甘心卖国，使帝国主义对中国更为猖狂进攻。好不容易，中国得到解放，以工人阶级为领导的新政权已经建立，实为中国独立自主的大好机会。我从前做蒋介石的帮手，实是错走了反祖国反人民的道路，决当改途易辙，回返祖国，痛改前非，且争取立功赎罪的机会。
    可是建立这个决心，并不是简单容易的事。我曾被人民列为战争罪犯。我回到祖国能否得保安全，我不能不有所顾虑。我在巴黎受伪驻法使馆的监视，又不易取得英国政府允许经过香港的执照。美国方面贿买我，邀我往美，许我金钱的待遇。诸如此类的阻碍和引诱都来动摇我的意志。我的结论还是不能惧怕困难，不能接受引诱，当此关头，必须坚决实行我弃暗投明的主意，才能对得起祖国。因此立定决心，我就飞行回来了。
    我回居首都北京到今将满四年。出于我意想之外的，人民待我非常宽大。在这期间，我从事地质学译作，没有受到任何限制与拘束，现还光荣地被邀为人民政协第二届全国委员会委员，这使我见到祖国人民正为从前误入迷途的人广开着悔过自新的道路。凡是要投向人民的，只要真诚爱护祖国，不怕无路可走。我自身受此宽待，更加强了我为人民出力工作以赎前罪的志愿。
    在我回国四年以来，我对解放以后的新中国许多现象，得能耳闻目见，知道真相，使我亲切见到以工人阶级为领导的人民民主政权保证实现除旧布新，以建设社会主义社会的伟大任务。
    就我个人从前担任地质和经济工作的经验来看，我曾做地质工作多年，固然因我领导无方，以致无法推动；但历来反动政权只图压迫剥削人民，根本不重视科学，对地质机关一如对其它科学机关，只是虚与敷衍，作为无关重要的装饰物品。因此从前地质家人数极少，虽然热心工作，仍不受人看重。现在完全不同了。在人民民主制度下，地质家大量加多，钻探坑探工作充分推进，在地质部有重点有计划的领导下，依据苏联先进经验，向前进行，已得到彰明昭著的重大成绩，远远超过于从前停滞不前的景况。而且因建设计划的逐年进展，地质方面还需要更多人员，更多勘探，正在加量发展，实是为建设工作供给了基本资料。
    我在参加蒋伪政权时对中国经济特为关心。那时是官僚资本主义特为发达的时代。特别是蒋宋孔陈各大家族使用权力，夺取财富，广置财产，成为掌握政权的特殊阶层，使全国经济根本动摇，人民生活日加穷苦。当时我对此情形，深为感慨。由今追想，我自身实也是官僚资本集团的一员，陷在其中，正是一丘之貉，没有分别。解放以后，经由彻底改革，地主阶级已由土地改革而消灭，民族资本家的企业也正在发展过程中被改造，社会主义经济成分取得了领导地位，为新中国奠定了社会主义经济基础。在这样基础上来进行国家建设，才能得到真实效果。从此可知蒋伪政权的所谓建设只是剥削人民出卖祖国的幌子，除了自欺欺人外没有任何意义。因此，我深切感觉我在伪政权中所做的经济工作也实是具有反祖国反人民的性质。
    由此想到政权本质具有根本关系。以蒋介石为中心的政权，不论“训政”“宪政”什么招牌，实质上就是法西斯独裁制度。蒋介石独裁的目标是为他私人的权位，官僚买办阶级的利益，和他压制人民的力量。这样性质的政权必然对任何帝国主义国家都甘愿出力拉拢，尽量勾结。他因勾结日本帝国主义不能如愿成功，就对美帝国主义屈膝投降，做得格外巴结。如此行为当然是祸国殃民的卖国政策。现在卖国集团逃往台湾，此外广大领土已归人民，脱却帝国主义的枷锁，百余年所积的耻辱从此扫除，中国真正得到独立自主，国际地位空前提高，足见人民民主制度的高度优越性，我们必须共同拥护。所可痛愤的是蒋介石卖国集团在台湾勾引美国武力，签订荒谬条约，向祖国疯狂进攻。我们为了反抗侵略，保全领土，须要加强努力，解放台湾，消灭卖国集团。
    总而言之，我回居祖国时期，一切现象都使我亲切见到中国因得解放始能复兴，因能反抗帝国主义故能保持主权和领土完整，因向社会主义前进故能建设成功。推求所以能如此进展的原因，实靠以工人阶级为领导，向马克思列宁主义所指明的目标迈步前进。在这过渡时期，尤必须共同一致，在共产党领导下，端正立场，经由改造运动，走向社会主义社会。像我这样曾经走错政治路线的人，更须坚定决心，认真学习，用新得的认识来清除我旧日思想的遗毒。我知道我政治知识极为落后，对社会主义的认识尚多不足，我必须坚决地和长期地学习，才能勉强追上解放以后的时代。我决当重新做人，尊重人民，报效国家，以尽我对祖国的责任。
    各位委员！我们从过去旧政权统治时代进入今天的光明时代，无法不把今昔情形互相对比。我们明见目前政治、经济、文化各方面的良好做法和伟大成就在旧政权统治下都不可能实现。我们须要拥护工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度，在共产党和毛主席领导下，学习苏联先进经验，向社会主义目标，团结一致，共同努力。目前还在过渡时期，剥削成分还待逐步消灭，非社会主义的经济力量还待积极改造，旧的封建落伍思想还没有完全消灭，美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团还在向我们进攻。在这样情况下，我们更有加紧用力的必要。我很愿尽我微力，偕同各位委员，加强工作，在人民民主统一战线上，共同努力，以期早日建成强固繁荣的社会主义社会。
    邓文翬委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我听了陈叔通副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告，又听了章伯钧委员关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明，我十分赞成，完全拥护，并认为工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度，已开辟了我国社会主义发展的广阔道路。自一九四九年中央人民政府成立以来，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导之下，不到几年就把一个东亚病夫奄奄待毙的中国复活起来了，并且壮大起来了。这就是中国共产党和毛主席的统一战线是起死回生的一包妙药所起的重要的作用。统一战线，既是一包妙药，在我国过渡时期中，这包妙药，还是要用的，还是不可少的。今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线，还要发挥它的作用，尤其是在章程草案的总纲内，规定共同遵守的准则七条，将中国人民政治协商会议的任务，已经包括无遗。最后，周恩来副主席在政治报告中，分析国际情况，目光远大，具有先见，所以对于抗美援朝，则胜算在握，对于折冲樽俎，则能操主动之权。我国国际地位，日见提高，自然不是偶然的。事实摆在面前，有英明的政府和英明的毛主席，就能做好国家的事。我们主张和平，但决不是怕战争。我们有全国勇敢不可战胜的士气，有维护世界和平、不可战胜的人心。飞机大炮，可以用金钱买到，人心士气，不可以金钱买到。我兴奋地觉得生逢今日毛泽东的新时代，自惭年老无所贡献，惟有在毛泽东旗帜下，跟在共产党后面努力迈进，完成社会主义的事业。
    梁漱溟委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    上前天我们听了周副主席所作的政治报告，对于当前局势给我们很好的分析指示，我和大家一样地完全拥护。再就是陈叔通副主席作的第一届政协全国委员会工作报告，章伯钧委员说明的政协章程草案，这两个文件在小组上都经过不少讨论，基本上大家都同意，希望大会正式通过。
    我原是政协上一届全国委员会的一个委员而这次又被提名参加到第二届全国委员会。这使我心理上一面惭愧，又一面感动兴奋。不禁想再说几句话。
    多年来，我自以为对中国问题有我的认识乃至还有一套办法，非常自信。虽在解放后，面对着中国共产党领导革命成功这一不可否认的伟大事实只有折服；同时更不能不折服于给共产党作理论根源的马克思列宁主义。但在参加第一届政协后，虽亦随着大家参加学习，表面上好像思想意识也有了不少改变，而实际上还是老一套的思想观点盘据在脑子里，很难拔除。几年来在政协中不止无所贡献，而且还有不少错误发生。像去年九月在政协常委扩大会上发言，就曾有过严重的错误。当时得领导上的批评和朋友们的指点之后，容我自己作了较深切的反省。又经过这一年多来较比切实的学习，似乎清楚了许多。回想起来昨天的我，真是愧悔已极。乃由于毛主席和中国共产党的宽大有容，与人为善，这一届我仍被提名为委员，心中实在感动的很，兴奋的很。
    政协第二届全国委员会会议的召开，正当我们第一个五年建设计划进入第三个年头和积极要解放台湾的今天，其意义是十分重大的。今后：第一，我愿意继续努力学习马克思列宁主义，切实改造自己，不负毛主席治病救人、与人为善的厚意；第二，我愿意追随政协同人各位委员之后，在建设国家和解放台湾的问题上，能尽自己的一分心力。还请大家多指教。
    张大中委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我们这次会议要以实际行动来响应中国共产党和毛主席的号召，用加强团结来为极其光荣伟大的社会主义事业而努力奋斗。我们衷心地拥护这个会议所提出的报告和中国人民政治协商会议章程。
    当我们想到摆在我们面前的事业是十分艰巨的时候，大家都关心年轻一代更健全的成长，关心我们如何在广大青年中间加强共产主义道德品质的教育问题。因此，我来简要地谈一下这个问题。
    大家知道：毛主席给青年的指示，是身体好、学习好、工作好。伟大的中国共产党从来都极端重视青年的共产主义品德的成长，我们的党把培养青年人为祖国服务、为人民服务的英勇精神，当作关心和教育青年的首要问题。由于党的领导和教育，在革命的年代里，中国青年英勇积极，同全国人民一道，推翻了反动派的罪恶统治，打败了美帝国主义的侵略。这几年来，由于党的教育，新中国年轻一代生气勃勃，奋发有为，为社会主义建设贡献着自己的力量。毫无疑义，这种为祖国为人民的英勇奋斗的高尚品质，是在青年中继续发扬光大，中国青年一定能够同全国人民一道，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放台湾，一定能够在伟大的社会主义建设事业中，发挥更大的作用，一定可以使我们创建起来的伟大事业得到可靠的保证。
    不过，我们也不能不看到，在少数青年中还存在着纪律松弛、道德败坏等不良现象。最近，我们在党的指示下，揭发了青年人中一些不良的现象。于是有人就问：这些现象很少，为什么要大声呼喊。我们说，我们的国家对每个青年都是关心的，我们希望每个青年都不沾染坏思想坏习惯，我们决不可因为这种现象的微小而存在麻痹大意。还有人问：新中国青年中为什么会有不良行为的存在。我们说，旧社会遗留下来的坏影响不是一下可以消除的，而在今天，旧社会残留下来的一些流氓分子还在勾引青年犯罪；旧社会还留下不少的黄色书刊，下流的娱乐场所，这些东西引诱青年堕落。同时，资产阶级的享乐腐化思想，对青年也发生腐蚀作用。因此，我们对毒害青年身心健康的、损害社会主义事业的一切思想和行为，必须引起义愤，必须与之作坚决的斗争。
    但我们青年团对培养青年共产主义道德品质的工作做得不够也是一个原因，我们正在努力改正这个缺点。我们要教育青年团员和青年随时随地把国家的利益、人民的利益、公共利益放在个人利益之上，用自己最大的力量为人民服务，为公共事业服务。我们要教育每一个团员和青年树立劳动观念和集体主义精神，要养成朴素、节俭的生活作风，爱护公共财产，模范地遵守政府的政策、法令，敢于向一切危害人民利益的现象进行斗争。我们一定要努力要求全体团员作出榜样，把自己锻炼成为共产主义的先进战士。我们要更好地关心青年的学习和生活，并把这些工作看成是对青年进行共产主义教育的重要组成部分。
    但加强青年的共产主义教育是一个长期的细致的工作，必须依靠整个的社会力量来共同进行。这里，我要特别说到家长对于子女的教育问题。没有一个家长是不爱护自己的子女的，可是有些家长不懂得如何正确地对待自己的子女。有的人借口工作忙，以为子女又有学校管，自己就可以不闻不问，不负责任。有的人不注意教育自己的子女好好学习，好好劳动，而是只管他们穿好吃好，把他们养成好逸恶劳只能享他人之福的人。有的人对子女沾染了坏习气，做了坏事情，不但不教育，不制止，反而采取放任、袒护的态度。这样对待子女，对年轻的一代是会发生很坏的思想影响，并给社会主义事业带来损害的。因此，我们要求这些家长们，从国家和人民的利益着想，从子女的前途着想，用正确的态度来对待子女。
    历史上英雄人物的故事，特别是革命历史、革命领袖和革命英雄人物的故事，对培养青年的共产主义道德品质有极大的作用。我们要再一次向作家们呼吁：创作更多的更好的这样的作品，来教育我们祖国近两亿的可爱的青年和少年。
    我们相信：在中国共产党的领导下，在整个社会力量的关怀下，我们对青年的共产主义教育必将大大加强起来。青年们将会像革命先辈希望的那样，像全国人民希望的那样，成长为社会主义的坚强一代，成为我们的伟大事业的可靠的接班人，把共产主义的旗帜撑持到最后的胜利。
    傅作义委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来副主席的政治报告。根据周副主席在报告中所指出的今后政协五大任务，我认为我们最主要的任务，就是团结全国人民，贯彻国家过渡时期总任务，加紧进行国家的社会主义工业化建设和社会主义改造；同时，拥护和平，反对侵略，为解放我国神圣领土台湾而斗争。现在我愿意就解放台湾问题，发表一点个人的意见。
    最近，美国侵略者同蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图无限期地霸占台湾，干涉中国人民行使自己的主权。这种公然侵占中国领土、干涉中国内政的侵略行为，是对国际公法和国际惯例最无耻的破坏。这同“九一八”事变时日本帝国主义扶植傀儡溥仪，侵占我国东北，简直是一模一样。
    美国侵略者同蒋介石卖国集团签订这个非法条约，是想用战争威胁，阻止我国人民解放台湾，并企图进一步扩大侵略战争。我愿意指出美国的好战分子是犯了极大的错误。要知道中国人民是在多年来帝国主义侵略压迫之下，经过了无数次的反抗斗争，才站起来的。因此，我们对于反对帝国主义侵略的各种阴谋诡计，有着最丰富的经验。这种阴谋诡计骗不了我们，也吓不倒我们。我们坚决拥护和平，但深深知道对侵略者的退让，就会引来更大的侵略。美国好战分子应该懂得，中国人民不办的事从来不说，说了的事一定办到。当美国侵略者侵略朝鲜威胁到我国安全的时候，我们说不能置之不理，美国侵略者当然记得，英雄的中国人民志愿军就完满无缺地执行了这句话。就台湾问题来说，我们作为一个主权国家，绝对不能容忍任何人割裂我国领土主权的完整。所以我们一定要解放台湾，这是任何力量也挡不住的。
    美国好战分子如果闭上眼睛，不愿看见解放后中国五年来的巨大变化，它一定要受到历史的惩罚。五年的时间虽然不长，但新中国已经完全不同于旧中国了。我们的工业、农业、交通运输等，不仅已经恢复，而且得到了迅速的发展。我们的人民解放军已经成长为具有高度政治觉悟和现代军事技术的不可战胜的力量。特别是全国各民族、各阶层、各党派的人民，在中国共产党的领导下，在建设社会主义的共同愿望和伟大目标的鼓舞下，已经像钢铁一样的团结起来了。几年来我在各地亲眼看到许多使我感动的事情，有许多一般人认为办不到的事，我们办到了，有许多平凡的人做出了不平凡的事业。原来有本领的人现在本领更大了，原来没有本领的人也变成了有本领的人。在新社会，真正达到了人尽其才，物尽其用，每个人都能充分发挥自己的力量，给人民做出一定的贡献。比如我曾看到许多年老的工程师，在旧社会读遍了各国的科学技术的书籍，可是到须发斑白却没有机会做一个工程。现在到处是大工程在等着他们，他们修成了巨大的水闸和全世界有数的钢筋混凝土连拱坝。我也看到在工作中涌现出来的无数的新人，去年看见他们还是外行，今年就成了精通业务的内行。建设祖国的奔放的热情，使蕴藏在人民心里的聪明智慧迸发出闪耀的光辉。此外，就是在劳动改造中的罪犯们，我也有机会常常看见他们。他们不是面黄肌瘦，精神颓丧，而是结实健壮地在进行劳动。最奇怪的是有些犯人在四通八达的野外劳动，已经不需要有人看管，甚至还有些罪犯，刑期已满而不愿离开，只是改变了犯人的身分，仍继续在那里工作。罪犯的心理尚且如此，那么，全国人民同政府的密切结合，坚强团结，就更不待言了。在国民党反动统治时期的一九三一年，武汉市长江洪水位到达二十六点九四公尺的时候，就决口泛滥；今年，武汉市长江洪水位到达二十九点七三公尺，却没有决口。但这只是说明了成果，还不能说明在这场惊险斗争中的人民力量。事实是这样的：在一百余公里的堤线上，水位都大大高出堤顶，如有一处漫溢，八万零
  一百秒立方公尺的流量（就是说每秒钟有八万零一百吨水），三公尺七的水头，就会像万马奔腾一样，倾泻直下而无法抵御。武汉市人民面对如此险恶的景象，而要在附近无法取土的困难情况下，临时筑堤挡水，来同不断增高的水位作持久的搏斗。最后，经过了五十六天的斗争，终于战胜了洪水。按常理说，这简直是办不到的事，但我们办到了。这不能不说是个奇迹，这奇迹充分说明了新中国人民应付意外事变的本领和力量。美国侵略者如果看不见这些事实，看不见解放了的中国人民内心的无比的勇敢、智慧和力量，妄想侵犯这样一个强大的国家，那就只能有一个失败的前途在等待着他。
    解放台湾是我们坚定不移的决心，但是完成这个任务当然还要作很多工作。我们政协全国委员会的委员们都深信，人民的力量是强大的，和平的愿望是普遍的。因此，我们有责任让全世界明白：在国家同国家之间只有互相尊重领土和主权的完整，互不干涉内政，才能真正保持和平。因此我们解放台湾，正是保卫和平。有些追随美国侵略政策的人们，故意颠倒是非，认为维持现状，让美国侵略者长期侵占台湾就可以缓和国际紧张局势。这是一种恶毒的欺骗宣传。我们必须加以揭露，并将我们和平的愿望和正义的主张真实地告诉全世界爱好和平的人们。中国革命是经过千曲百折，才找到今天这
  一条唯一正确的道路。我们的国家在中国共产党领导下，实现了空前未有的统一，建设事业蓬勃发展。在国际事务中，我们以大国的风度，正义的力量，坚持和平外交政策，鼓舞着全世界被压迫人民的希望。这一切都是百年以来中国人民所只能梦想而不能见到的事实。现在我们已经建成这样一个伟大可爱的祖国，国内国外的同胞，都因此而感到自豪。因此，我们有责任团结和动员国内国外一切有爱国心的中国人，为解放台湾、反对美帝国主义的侵略而贡献出自己的力量。我们的人民民主统一战线具有广泛的基础。在反对内外敌人的斗争中，革命的大门是向一切爱国的人们敞开着的。凡是反对蒋介石卖国贼、反对美帝国主义侵略的人们，都应该以中国共产党为核心，紧密地巩固地团结起来，为建设社会主义祖国、为解放台湾和保卫世界和平而斗争。
    最后，我建议大会一致通过陈叔通副主席所作的工作报告和人民政协章程。
    吴晗委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意周恩来副主席的政治报告，陈叔通副主席的工作报告，章伯钧委员的章程草案说明。今天我要讲一讲城市中无组织青年的问题。在城市中，除了学校、厂矿、机关、部队和商店中的青年以外，还有相当多的青年是没有组织的，如青年家庭妇女、青年摊贩、青年手工业者和一些没有上学和就业的青年。在天津，青年的总数是六十万，无组织青年估计有三十万；上海的比数更大，青年的总数是一百四十万，无组织青年估计有八十万。由于农村青年不断流入城市和其他原因，预计各地的无组织青年还会继续增加。他们一般地文化水平比较低，缺少专门的技能。但是他们跟所有的青年一样，也渴望学习，要求进步；希望在国家的社会主义建设中能贡献出自己的一份力量。同样的，他们也要求参加各种社会活动，要求丰富多样的文化生活。
    青年是祖国社会主义建设的一支主要力量和后备军。城市中无组织青年的数目有如此之大，我们应该关心他们，教育他们，帮助他们学习政治、文化和技术，特别是培养他们的道德品质，使他们有可能逐步地参加祖国的建设工作。如果我们不这样做，他们中间很大一部分人就很容易受资产阶级思想的腐蚀，受流氓和坏人的引诱而腐化堕落。这样就不但对祖国的建设不利，还会扰乱社会的治安。因此我们必须重视这个问题。
    中华全国民主青年联合会在共产党和人民政府的领导和支持下，几年来在团结和教育城市无组织青年方面做了一些工作。在许多城市里，我们发动和组织了一部分无组织青年参加了历次的社会改革运动，参加了抗美援朝运动，参加了普选和宪法宣传等各项中心工作，参加了街道工作和各种社会服务。我们通过自学小组、读报小组、报告会、座谈会等形式，向他们进行了各种政治、文化和科学技术教育。我们也组织和帮助他们开展文化、娱乐和体育活动，使他们身心两方面都能正常地发展。虽然这样，我们的工作面还很狭小，没有能把大多数无组织青年团结起来。我们举办的活动一般都不够多样，不够活泼，没有能密切结合青年的特点，还不能吸引更广泛的无组织青年参加。所以我们今后必须充分争取社会力量的支持和帮助，改进我们的工作。希望各有关方面协助我们做好这个工作。
    我们希望各地的文化、科学、体育等社会团体尽量吸收城市无组织青年来参加各种活动，或者特地为他们举办各种活动，如各种讲座、报告会、座谈会、游园会、参观、旅行等等；并且尽可能帮助他们组织球队、歌咏队和剧团。我们也希望各地的居民委员会设置青年委员会或青年委员来管理无组织青年的工作，发动他们参加各种社会活动和义务劳动，帮助他们组织各种学习小组和文娱体育活动。
    我们希望各地的图书馆、文化馆和文化站尽量给广大无组织青年以便利，组织他们读书读报，指导他们的文化娱乐活动；各地的广播电台特地为他们举办节目，帮助他们学习，并且组织他们收听；各个出版社多出通俗书刊，帮助他们自学；各位作家和画家多写和多画适合他们兴趣的有益的作品。
    我们希望各地的文化教育部门加强对私立补习学校的领导和管理，督促他们改进教育质量，使无组织青年在补习学校里确实能学到参加祖国建设所必需的知识和技术。
    我们希望青年们的家长关心自己子弟的日常生活和学习，特别关心培养他们的道德品质，使他们的身心能得到正常的发展。
    团结和教育城市中的无组织青年，是非常广泛复杂的工作，也是非常重要的工作。我们相信，在各方面的关怀、协助和督促下，我们一定能做好这一工作，使城市中广大的无组织青年在祖国的社会主义建设中，能够贡献出他们自己的力量。
    王葆真委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我听了周恩来副主席的政治报告，感觉到需要举出最近在地方上的几点事实，来证明这一报告是会得到人民坚决拥护的。
    第一点：关于农村粮食的供应。河北省今年水灾相当的严重，为了使节约度荒和统购统销政策相结合，河北省人民政府号召全省人民节约粮食，并提出要按灾区、非灾区、山区、经济作物等不同地区规定不同的粮食供应数字。这是根据人民生活的需要而提出的。当时我们曾讨论了是否够吃？青壮年可能不够吃，老人、妇女和小孩子多半吃不完，匀配一下都够吃。因为河北农村多用菜蔬、甘薯等类为副食品，配合供应的粮食，这样就都可以够吃。我曾到过几个乡区，问过粮食供应的数目和是否够吃？乡村人说：配合着副食品，国家供应的粮食都可以够吃。政府一面调拨粮食运送灾区，保证灾民粮食供应；一面鼓励人民节约度荒，做到有备无患。这就是河北农村在粮食方面的真实情况。
    第二点：政府贷款给人民，鼓励开展副业，生产自救。如白洋淀的水乡安新县人民仅织席打苇包二项，一年即可收入千亿元以上，曲阳县山区妇女纳鞋底一项收入，冬春两季可获百亿元。各县副业生产有十三种至四十种之多，仅农村织布一宗，每人每日可获三千至五、六千元，人民只要肯劳动，没有吃不饱的。政府对于老、弱、孤、独、残废无劳动力者都予以救济。但有个别的有劳力而不肯劳动，不肯生产，生活困难，吃不上饭，专依靠政府救济，是不应该的，是群众所不同意的。
    第三点：群众对于统购统销的政策，近来都很了解，表示热烈的拥护。在十一月二十六日下午三时半，我们经过蓟县的溵溜乡，看见有二十多辆骡马大车在游行，每辆大车装载十几条大布袋的粮食，车上坐着卖粮户，多数是妇女，也有老人，都佩带着群众献给的彩花。村民和学生夹道欢呼：“卖余粮给国家！支援解放台湾！拥护三统三销政策！”又看见各县运粮入库的大车上，好多都插着这样标语的旗子。
    灾区的人民说：“毛主席真是有预见，今年这样大的水灾，若不是统购统销，有粮的不卖，无粮的干瞪眼，那得饿死多少人呢！”这说明国家的粮食政策已经受到了人民深切的了解和热烈的拥护。
    第四点：人民民主专政的巩固和农业生产合作社的发展。当我们十月二十八日自保定出发视察水灾水利的时候，正是河北省推行统购统销三项工作的时候，各县干部，日夜研究，计算分担征购数字，准备胜利地完成他们担负的任务。乡村干部和群众对于雨季的防汛工作，尽了最大的努力；专员、县长亲自领导河工，所有干部艰苦斗争的生活，已成为习惯。我在最近期间访问了二十五个县、十个区、六个乡，走过了乡下道路三千多里，到处看到社会秩序安定、平稳，往来运输的大车小辆，异常繁忙，无论山区或是海滨，无论清晨或是夜晚，我们都是很平安地、很放心地向前行进，从未遇见一件争吵的事和妨害治安的事发生。
    从前河北农村人民不少穿着补过的破衣服，现在我经过这么多地方，只看见五个人穿着打补绽的衣服。在十一月十一日早起我们乘坐一辆马车，赴定县城南三十里叮咛店视察沟渠制度，途中看到一大片棉花地有十四、五个穿着红红绿绿花洋布衣服的妇女和六、七个穿着整齐的蓝布制服的男子，排成半齐半不齐的行列，正在摘棉花。他们一面工作，一面说笑歌唱。这幅美丽的图画，充分地表现着人民对农业生产合作社的发展和愉快情绪。这些情况在个别县也遇到过几次，这是在旧社会所不能想到、看到的事情。定县一县开展到两千八百多个农业生产合作社，占总农户百分之四十八，全村组织起来的有一百一十七村，就是有一百一十七村的人民完全参加了合作社。晋县周家庄农业生产合作社，有拖拉机站，有锥井，有砖窑，有粉房，有保健站、托儿所，有剧团，有俱乐部，有收音机和活动画片，周末有跳舞会，有黑板报，有批评，有表扬，全社有两千个人口而没有一个是文盲。这说明了农业社会主义的改造和发展，突飞猛进，有一日千里的景象。饶阳县因为今年水大分洪，淹没了若干村庄。灾民说：宁淹饶阳一个县，不淹堤北六七县。新乐县四区邯台镇今夏为泻水排涝，开掘沟地，一个老年农民李老中自愿牺牲自己的田地和树木，以减除公共的水灾。他们都能本着小利服从大利的精神，解决问题。
    仅就这些情况看来，已够说明了在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下的人民政治觉悟的提高和社会主义改造在农村的发展；也说明了人民民主专政的基础益加巩固。这显然证明周恩来副主席的报告完全符合人民的要求，是会得到人民衷心拥护的。
    同时，周恩来副主席在政治报告中对于当前国际形势的分析和坚决表示中国人民一定要解放台湾，我完全拥护。周恩来副主席又指出思想改造要反复改造，我认为这是学习马克思列宁主义最好的方法。
    最后，我表示同意陈叔通副主席代表政协第一届全国委员会所作的工作报告和章伯钧委员关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明，希望即予通过贯彻实行。
    承澹酓委员的发言
    我是一个中医工作者，一向爱好研究针灸学，过去在旧社会里是被反动统治阶级所歧视的，今天我竟能参加中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会，感到非常荣幸和兴奋。我首先衷心地感谢共产党和毛主席对我们的亲切关怀和支持。
    在这次大会中我听了周恩来副主席的政治报告，以及中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告和中国人民政协章程草案的说明。对这些报告和说明我都完全同意，并愿切实遵行。
    自中华人民共和国成立以来，人民政府就团结了全国各方面的力量，发扬了民主精神，大规模地进行着经济建设，所以任何事业，任何部门都充分表现出一片欣欣向荣的新气象。这是值得我们欢欣鼓舞的。
    我不止一次听到中央首长关于发挥中医学术的功能，以加强卫生保健工作的号召。我们知道：针灸学术早在我国远古时代，就已经有了。在解放以前的反动派统治时期，由于他们的腐化、昏庸，科学技术得不到发展，祖国宝贵的医学遗产——中医，特别如像针灸，更一贯是受到鄙视和束缚。解放以后，党和政府发出重视中医的号召，扭转了人们对中医的认识；加以政府广泛开展人民保健工作，普遍地设置联合诊所、卫生站，使中医和西医共同负荷起保护人民健康的光荣任务。
    解放台湾是全国人民的神圣事业。我们中医工作者应该以主人翁的态度积极支援解放台湾的斗争，责无旁贷地担负起救病扶伤的光荣任务。
    我们医务工作者，必须更进一步地团结起来，坚决地在共产党和毛主席领导下，支援前线、支援祖国的社会主义建设，为解放台湾、完成祖国的社会主义建设、完成中国人民光荣的历史任务而奋斗。
    张修竹委员的发言
    我完全同意陈叔通副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会的工作报告和周恩来副主席的政治报告，中国工人阶级将为彻底实现上述报告中所提出的任务而奋斗。
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会已经完满地完成了它的历史任务。现在摆在中国各民族、各阶级、各党派、各人民团体面前的任务，是更加巩固全国人民的团结，更加巩固人民民主统一战线，动员全国人民，胜利地把我们伟大的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义的国家。这个伟大的目标和为了达到这一目标所必须遵循的道路，都已经在我国的宪法中规定下来了。中国工人阶级一定同全国人民一起，为实现这个伟大的目标而努力。
    由于最近几年来我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的发展，人民民主统一战线的基础是愈益坚强了，全国人民的团结也愈益巩固了。中国工人阶级的团结、工人阶级同农民的团结以及全国人民的团结，对于我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，对于反对国内外敌人和解放台湾的斗争，是具有重大意义的。工会组织，在全国人民团结的事业中，愿意努力发挥自己的积极作用。
    在过去的几年当中，工会组织在中国共产党的领导下忠实地遵守了中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议所制定的共同纲领。在国民经济恢复时期，组织和动员了工人群众，同全国人民一起，以忘我的劳动克服了各种困难，完成了恢复时期的任务，支援了抗美援朝的伟大斗争。
    现在我国已经进入社会主义建设和社会主义改造时期。在这个时期，工会组织最重要的、最基本的任务就是组织群众性的劳动竞赛，组织并且帮助职工群众学习先进技术，充分发挥工人阶级的积极性和创造性，来全面完成国家的经济建设计划。同时，工会组织和广大的职工群众，也注意到了自己在社会主义改造事业上所担负着的责任。广大的职工群众在努力完成国家计划的时候，知道他们的这种努力同时就是对于农民的帮助，也知道自己在建设事业上的成就是同农民和全体劳动人民的劳动分不开的。
    在对于资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的事业上，我们工会组织也在努力使自己发挥一定作用。许多有利于国计民生的资本主义企业，在政府的大力扶持和工人群众的积极帮助下，已经走上了国家资本主义的道路。这些企业，大部分在生产上有了新的气象，经营管理也有了若干改进。应当承认，很多资本家是愿意接受社会主义改造并且已经在接受社会主义改造了，他们是奉公守法的。但是也有部分资本家，在“五反”运动之后，在过渡时期的总路线公布之后，在第一次全国人民代表大会已经制定并且颁布了宪法之后，对生产依然采取消极怠工的态度，依然有偷税漏税、偷工减料、抽逃资金、拖欠工资，甚至挑拨职工群众同政府的关系的行为。请允许我直率地说一句，这些行为对社会主义改造事业不利，对国家人民事业不利，就是对于这些资本家自身也是不利的。这是有碍团结的。我们希望这些资本家改变这种态度。
    改造资本主义工商业，必须改革它的经营管理方法。而经营管理方法的改革，没有职工群众的协助和监督是不可能顺利进行的。因此，工会组织和职工群众在资本主义工商业中的任务，就是积极协助资本家改善经营管理、增加生产、提高质量、降低成本；同时，也要监督资本家正确贯彻政府的政策、法令和尊重职工的正当权益，经过国家资本主义的道路，完成对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。当然，也应当承认，在资本主义企业中的少数职工，也有不积极生产、不遵守劳动纪律的情形。我们工会组织将继续教育这些职工，进一步改变这种情形。
    各位委员，当我们在这里举行会议以便于进一步团结起来建设我们祖国的时候，美帝国主义者同蒋介石卖国集团已经签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图永远霸占我国领土——台湾。美帝国主义者和蒋介石卖国集团的这种行径，不但是对中国人民的严重挑衅，也是对亚洲和世界和平的严重威胁。广大的职工群众对于美国帝国主义的这种侵略行为，已经表示了无限的愤慨。中国工会组织和职工群众，完全拥护一九五四年十二月八日周恩来外交部长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明。中国人民一定要解放台湾，中国工人阶级将以最大的努力，来支援和参加解放台湾的斗争。
    冀朝鼎委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来副主席的政治报告。
    自日内瓦会议以来，国际局势本来已有进一步的缓和，国际贸易也有可能向正常的方向发展。但是，美国不甘心在亚洲的侵略政策的失败，不仅组织了所谓“东南亚防务集团”，签订了所谓美蒋
  “共同防御条约”，而且指使蒋介石残余匪帮继续猖狂地进行截劫商船、抢劫货物、扣留船员等蛮横无理的破坏公海航行自由的海盗活动。
    美国这种破坏国际经济交流的行动很久以前就开始了。远在一九五一年，在美国的操纵之下，联合国就非法地通过了对我国所谓“禁运”案；接着，美国国会又通过了所谓“巴特尔”法案，用停止“美援”为威胁，以禁运“战略物资”为借口，迫使接受“美援”的国家割断同我国和其他和平民主国家的正常贸易联系。
    美国统治集团妄图拿这种手段来扼杀我国的和平经济，破坏和平民主国家的建设，以便垄断世界的市场和原料，攫取最大限度的利润，并妄想借此把它日益成熟的经济危机转嫁在别的国家和人民的身上。
    但是，自“禁运”及其他歧视措施实施以来，我国的经济非但没有被扼杀，反而迅速地恢复和发展起来了；我国的对外贸易非但没有被缩小，反而不断地在扩大着。我国同苏联和其他人民民主国家，已建立了巩固的经济互助合作关系，形成了一个新的日趋强大而繁荣的民主世界市场。我国同资本主义世界中的五十多个国家也先后发生或发展了贸易关系，其中有许多国家同我国签订了贸易协定、协议和支付协定。
    事实证明，“禁运”及其他歧视措施对我们没有达到它的目的而遭到彻底失败了。但对被迫执行“禁运”措施的国家，却失掉了同民主世界市场从事经济交流活动的好处，由此加深了它们国内的经济困难。而美国统治集团，就利用这种困难，以“美援”作钓饵，加紧控制这些接受“美援”的国家，使它们非但没有得到援助，反而更加失去其独立性。
    由此可见，“禁运”及其他歧视政策已经在执行它的各国造成了很大的损失和困难，在这些国家的人民中引起了强烈的不满。因此，他们纷纷要求同我国及其他和平民主国家恢复并发展正常的贸易关系。
    我们的政府向来主张在平等互利的基础上，同任何国家发展正常的通商贸易关系。自从日内瓦会议以后，我国同印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和锡兰等国之间所签订的贸易协定或协议，证明不同社会和经济制度的国家，是可以和平共处、互通有无、恢复和发展正常贸易关系的。
    作为一个和平友好工作者，我完全拥护政府对发展国际间正常贸易关系所采取的一切措施，并愿以全力协助政府促使这些措施的实现。
    美国统治集团对国际间正常贸易关系的猖狂破坏，已在全世界人民面前日益暴露其蛮横无理和侵略的性质；而我们对发展国际间正常贸易关系所作的努力，则为全世界爱好和平的人民所支持。因此，开展国际间正常贸易和友好关系的斗争是必然会得到完全胜利的。
    叶雨田委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我这次参加中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议，感到十分光荣和兴奋。
    我完全拥护并同意周恩来副主席的政治报告，陈叔通副主席的工作报告和章伯钧委员关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明。
    宪法序言指出：“今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线将继续发挥它的作用。”民族资产阶级既然是人民民主统一战线的一员，就必须对国家对人民作出一定的贡献。但是，毫无疑义，只有在接受中国共产党和工人阶级的领导，在接受社会主义改造的前提下，这种贡献才是可能的。
    自国家在过渡时期总任务明确以后，西安市私营工商业得到当地党政有关部门的指导和关怀，正在健康地逐步地走上国家资本主义的道路。截至本年十月底止，接受加工订货的工业户数，已占全市工业总户数百分之四十五强；为国营商业批销、经销和代销的商业户数，已占全市商业总户数百分之二十强。大部分失去作用的批发商已经转向有利于国计民生的工业，转业资金共达五百八十余亿元，转业人员共计二千余人。成为公私合营的工商业企业已有十七家，多为比较大型的工厂。这就说明：私营工商业的改造是可能的，民族资产阶级是愿意接受改造的。但是，我们也不容讳言，尚有少数思想落后的私营工商业者，用挥霍浪费、抽走资金、偷工减料、消极经营等违反总任务的行为，来抗拒社会主义的改造。这就需要我们加强思想教育和加强个人改造的工作，以克服工商界的错误思想和行动。
    蒋介石卖国集团勾结美帝国主义侵占我国神圣的领土——台湾，最近又签订所谓美蒋“共同防御条约”，企图扩大侵略战争，威胁我国领土的安全，并阻挠我们社会主义建设。我们竭诚拥护周恩来外长的严正声明，一定要给侵略者以坚决的反击。我愿做好本岗位工作，团结并推动私营工商业者，积极地服从国营经济的领导，改善企业的经营管理，以踊跃认购公债和交纳税款的实际行动，来支援解放台湾的神圣斗争。
    中国人民政治协商会议章程草案规定了各参加单位和个人共同遵守的七项准则，我认为这是完全符合于宪法的精神和国家在过渡时期总任务的要求的。拿我个人的政治水平和工作质量来衡量，还是同七项准则有很大的距离。但是，我有信心和决心在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，运用批评和自我批评的武器，努力学习，不断改造，全心全意地为完成会议所给我的光荣任务而奋斗。
    查干葛根委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    对于中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告、中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明和周恩来副主席的政治报告，我表示完全同意和拥护。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，将马克思列宁主义同我们中国的具体实践结合起来，领导我们建立和巩固了新中国人民民主政权，并在此基础上在今年召开了全国人民代表大会会议，制定了宪法，给人民走向盼望已久的美满幸福的社会主义社会开辟了广阔的大道。我们经过这条道路，一定能够走入社会主义社会，几年来的铁的事实可以证明这一点。
    释迦牟尼佛教导说，要把众人的事情看得比自己一个人的事情重要得多，要慈爱善良的人和救济有难者。遵守这些教义的佛教徒们，完全拥护我们国家的社会主义建设事业。佛教的教义是主张和平的，对于国家和宗教的敌人，是反对的。因此，佛教徒是同全国人民在一起维护世界和平的正义事业的。
    解放前，国民党反动派歧视宗教，破坏寺庙，反而造谣说，共产党来了要消灭宗教。解放之初，有的佛教徒听信国民党反动派的谣言，对共产党的认识不足，还存在着顾虑，担心宗教要被摧毁，宗教信仰要被破坏。但几年的事实证明了这种顾虑是不必要的。共同纲领规定了宗教信仰自由的政策，今年颁布的宪法又专条规定了人民有宗教信仰的自由。佛教徒们已经成立了自己的全国性的组织——中国佛教协会。这些事实说明，生活在解放了的新中国的佛教徒们，充分地享有着宗教信仰的自由，我们的信仰受到了认真的尊重，我们的生活得到了周到的照顾，我们的社会地位也大大的提高了。
    几年来在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导下，各族人民紧密团结起来了。在反抗美帝国主义侵略和粉碎蒋介石卖国残余集团的斗争中，已经取得了伟大的胜利。在此基础上，我们要进一步加强团结，为解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，以顺利地进行国家的社会主义建设和保卫世界和平事业而奋斗。
    陶述曾委员的发言
    我同意陈叔通副主席的工作报告和章伯钧委员关于章程草案的说明，拥护周恩来副主席的政治报告，并保证遵行章程草案总纲规定的七项准则。
    湖北省今年是严重水灾区，武汉市是防汛重点，这是各位委员久已关心的事。我来自湖北，谨就我个人参加防汛救灾工作所知道的情况作简短报告。
    湖北省今年受水灾的区域有四十二个县，受灾的时间最早的在六月初，到八月中旬水灾达到最高峰，十月初，灾民才开始还乡。避灾转移的人口约四百六十万，其中三分之一转移到外县。
    现在绝大部分被水淹的土地已经退出来了。灾民绝大部分都回返了家园。
    六月初的水灾是鄂南山区和大别山区的山洪暴发，山洪的泛滥期很短，但破坏性很大，人畜死伤较多，水灾中心是崇阳县和罗田县。六月中旬至七月间的水灾是长期暴雨的积水，所有湖区的民垸都被积水淹没了。七月下旬以后的水灾是由于江汉堤防决口，但这一期增加的受灾面积并不多。此外，人民政府还实行了有计划分洪，给了分洪区居民以赔偿。在武汉上游，由于积水和分洪被淹的面积约一万平方公里。分洪是有计划的，分洪区的居民都有计划地迁移出来，没有生命损失。
    大汛期间，省的中心工作是防汛救灾。党政干部除留少数进行日常工作外，都投入这一中心工作。所有的轮船拖驳，和二十多万吨民船以及约四万只副业船都组织起来参加工作。由于有强大的干部力量和船只运力，因而灾民都得到及时抢救，耕牛也用木排和大民船救到安全地点。灾民口粮和搭棚的材料也得到及时供应。
    对没有受灾的区域也作了普遍深入的动员。在五年来党和人民政府的教育的基础上，没有受灾区域的农民充分表现了友爱精神，他们让房屋、让土地和借种子、借农具、借家具给灾民，使大部分灾民能够分种，垦荒，有栖息之所，有事可做。
    在水灾初期曾有疾疫流行。主要是痢疾。人民政府动员了大批医护人员，组织巡回医疗船、医疗队，深入到疾疫流行区，进行防疫和治疗工作。十月初，传染病基本被扑灭了。痢疾病人数由百分之七八十减少至百分之十以下。
    从十月初旬起，省的中心工作转到灾民还乡重建家园和堵口复堤方面。交通运输为此服务，运灾民还乡，运送口粮、种籽、房屋材料、铺床和喂牛的草，以及其他的生活资料和生产工具，还运输堵口复堤的器材。江汉干堤主要决口如长江的上车湾，汉江的五子阁、禹王宫等处都在十一月下旬堵塞了。到目前，灾区存粮大部分在两个月以上，每人每天口粮十四两，参加修堤、运输、复路和恢复灌溉工程等工作的农民每人每天外加口粮一斤。
    湖北虽然是重灾区，但非灾区都是丰收的。灾区粮食来源主要是本省内部调剂。由外省调剂的数量不大，据我了解，四川协助大米四万吨，河南协助二万吨。湖北还用小麦向华北掉换了一些大米。
    在防汛方面，虽然长江中游今年是有水文记录以来空前的洪水，但由于党和人民政府根据气象和水文的预报，事先作了充分准备。湖北境内三大重点（武汉市、荆江大堤和黄石市）的防汛斗争都获得了胜利。荆江大堤是五百万人口的生命保障，武汉市是华中经济中心，黄石市是重工业区。武汉防汛的胜利不仅振奋了全国人民，而且在国际方面也有很大的政治影响。这一胜利使民主阵营兄弟国家欢喜，使爱好和平的国家和人民钦佩，也使幸灾乐祸的敌人失望。
    当武汉水位逐日上升的时候，美帝国主义的报纸不断造谣说共产党没有办法了。但结果，武汉已经解除了水灾威胁的时候，美国的第二大城市芝加哥却被洪水淹没了。
    武汉防汛的胜利，是在共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的亲切关怀下，在省、市党委和政府的直接领导下，在全国的物质支援下和全市人民的积极忘我劳动下获得的。今年的水位比一九三一年的最高水位高一点四五公尺，比一九三一年汉口决口淹没时的水位高二点七九公尺。比武汉最高的堤面高○点二三公尺，最大风浪比堤面高约二点○○公尺，持续在警戒水位以上整整一百天。（比堤内地面高一点四至七点七公尺。）一百三十八公里长的堤防，防汛期间，五期加高培厚工程，共做了土方二百七十万公方，石方十六万八千公方，防浪木排六二点四公里。在风浪力量强大的堤段做了三线或四线防浪工程。土方和石方是由三十里至三百余里以外运来的，八百万条麻袋和草袋，五万多公方杉木，六百多万斤芦苇和秫秸，六千多个大铁锚，二百七十万公尺的竹缆，六千公尺的钢丝绳，是从东北，华北，华东，华南，西南各地运来的。旧社会遗留下来的堤防质量很差，在空前的洪水压力下发生了较严重的险情二千多次。由于人力物力的充足，组织领导的坚强，党的预见，堤防加强总赶在洪峰到来的前面。险情都随时抢救了。三十万防汛大军，都以无比的热情竞赛劳动。七月十九日大风，打坏了初期做成的全部防浪苇排，十万以上的防汛人员自动站在水里，用身体挡住大浪，坚持八小时之久，捍卫了大堤。在抢救大险中，有几十个军人、工人献出了自己的生命。像这样的英雄事迹是不可胜举的。
    在技术方面，创造了堤身排水的倒滤工程，克服了堤身的普遍浸漏，创造了防浪排，克服了风浪的威胁，这些创造都是工程师和工人商量试验出来，得到领导支持，即时推广的。在防汛情报方面，华中气象台、长江水利委员会和中南水利局经常供给气象和水文预报，对每一期的工程计划和每一天的工作计划都起了指导作用。
    有计划的分洪，对荆江大堤、武汉市和黄石市的防汛胜利起了决定性的作用。荆江分洪工程初次运用，削低了沙市一带的洪峰七八公寸，保全了荆江大堤和堤内无数人的生命。长江的上车湾分洪，洪湖分洪，鲁湖分洪，可能削低了武汉洪峰一公尺以上。梁子湖两次分洪保全了黄石市。有计划的分洪不仅削了洪峰，还争取了三个重点堤防加高加固的时间。分洪对农民的损失是不大的。因为从今年四月起，江汉水位就直线上升，到四月底，江汉水位就比湖区民垸的地面高，五、六、七三个月的连续暴雨，已经把所有的民垸淹没了，分洪不过增加了淹没的深度，使居民的房屋和家具等增加了损失，人民政府都发给了适当的赔偿费和救济费，因而农民对分洪并没有思想抵触。许多老农民说，如果不是政府有计划的分洪，灾情不知道要扩大多少倍，人也不知道要淹死多少。
    湖北省防汛救灾工作的胜利充分说明了我们国家的人民民主制度的优越性，这一胜利给予全省人民以极大的教育，提高了社会主义觉悟，巩固了工农联盟。全省人民尤其是灾区人民都回想过一九三一年的水灾情况，今昔对比，大家都感到了党和人民政府的关切，感到国家的可爱，也感到自己对国家的责任。灾区人民的生活当然还是很苦的，房屋太少，农具不够，耕牛缺乏，生活物资不充分，但生产情绪一般是高的，对重建家园是有信心的。这些不足的现象也正在逐渐克服和改善。我在这里建议对重灾区除救济和贷给种子贷给现款之外，还宜贷给耕牛、农具和铁木工具，只要有充足的工具，农民是能够很迅速地重建自己的家园的。
    今年长江中下游的空前洪水主要原因是中下游流域夏季的长期暴雨。湘鄂赣三省五、六、七三个月的雨量都超过了平均年雨量。从四川下来的水量并不太大。因而上游建筑水库不能彻底解决长江洪水问题。利用中游湖沼蓄洪的计划应作为治本计划的一部分。今年湖北水灾的生命损失是由山洪暴发酿成的，六月初鄂南的洪水猛涨，崇阳一县就死了四百多人。今后治水的方针应把水土保持、多筑谷坊、减少径流率，作为重点之一。五年多来对这一正本清源工作是注意得不够的。
    湖北省和武汉市今年防汛救灾工作成绩是伟大的。但缺点也不少。就我所参加的工作来说，灾民回乡的初期，生活物资运输分配不平衡，造成某些地区食盐食油抢购的紧张现象。煤油脱销的情况更普遍。而运输工具因调度不适当，还没有发挥应有的效率。
    武汉防汛工作中，在保证安全的条件下节省人工器材，掌握机动后备力量还不够灵活，造成某些堤段过分加强，浪费人力物力。在科学技术研究方面更做得太少。例如防浪木排没有作多种多样的试验；堤基土壤的透水性，地下水随江水涨落而变化的规律，下层流沙发生涌沸的规律等等事先都没有作有计划的布置，进行试验观测。在这一大规模的长期艰巨斗争中只得到一些片断的经验，不能把这些经验提高到科学的理论上，使其便于传播，便于继续充实和提高。作为一个新中国的工程师，他不应以完成任务为满足，不应以获得片断的经验为满足。他必须通过工人群众的实践，有计划地运用工人群众的力量和智慧，不断地改进操作方法，充实科学理论，以求创造新的操作方法，发展科学理论，为次一步工作创造更高的条件。检查起来，我之所以在三十万防汛大军、一百天的紧张工作中没有很大的收获，不仅是科学技术水平不够的问题，而是对群众的实践，对群众的力量和智慧是科学的源泉这一点认识不足，工作计划缺乏预见，不全面，不周密。工作方法是只顾任务的完成，忽略了科学资料的积累，没有把群众的实际经验和科学理论的研究结合起来。总起来说，是缺乏马克思列宁主义的思想方法和工作方法。
    中国人民政治协商会议章程草案总纲规定的七项准则中，第七项的规定对我们科学工作者是更为重要的。我们必须努力学习马克思列宁主义的理论，以此为我们治学的基础，以此为我们工作和行动的指针，以此为我们思想改造的准则。
    各位委员：在党和人民政府的领导下，湖北全省人民团结组织起来战胜了空前的洪水，我相信全国六亿人民团结组织起来的伟大力量，也必然能够解放台湾，能够粉碎帝国主义的侵略，能够使繁荣幸福的社会主义社会建设完成。
