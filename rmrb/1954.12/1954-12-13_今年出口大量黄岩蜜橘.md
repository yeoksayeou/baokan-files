    Large Export of Huangyan Mandarin Oranges This Year

    The East China Company of the China Food Company has already completed its annual plan for the export of Huangyan mandarin oranges supplied by Zhejiang on December 1st. The quantity completed exceeds that of last year by more than 60 percent. The total export value can be exchanged for approximately 62 sets of combined coal mining machines for the country.

    Due to the fact that orange farmers organized agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and actively waged a tenacious struggle against natural disasters, continuous rain, and drought, a comprehensive bumper harvest of oranges was achieved. The orange farmers realized the significance of oranges to the country's industrial construction, and enthusiastically sold oranges that met export specifications to the country, enabling the country's annual plan for the supply of Huangyan mandarin oranges for export to be completed ahead of schedule.

    As early as when the oranges were first picked, Soviet fruit experts, including Comrade Begov, went to the production areas to provide specific guidance on harvesting. When the oranges began to be loaded and transported, they were stationed in Hangzhou, personally guiding the processing and inspection of the oranges every day, and specifically assisting in the modification of insulated wagons for transporting the oranges, ensuring the good quality of the exported oranges.

    今年出口大量黄岩蜜橘
    中国食品公司华东区公司由浙江供应出口的黄岩蜜橘，已于十二月一日完成全年计划，比去年全年所完成的数量增加了百分之六十以上。其出口总值，约可为国家换回联合采煤机六十二套。
    由于橘农们组织农业生产合作社和互助组，积极与自然灾害、连绵阴雨、干旱等作顽强斗争，取得了橘子全面丰收。橘农们认识到橘子与国家工业建设的意义，踊跃把合乎出口规格的橘子卖给国家，使国家供应出口的黄岩蜜橘全年计划能够提前完成。
    早在橘子刚刚采摘时，苏联水果专家贝哥夫等同志就到产地具体指导采摘。橘子开始装运时，他们又常驻杭州，每天亲自指导橘子的加工、检验，并具体帮助改装装运橘子的保温车厢，使出口的橘子品质良好。（金　华）
