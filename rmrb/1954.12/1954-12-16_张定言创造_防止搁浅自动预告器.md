Zhang Dingyan, the leader of the Navigation Supervision Team of the Nanjing Port Administration Bureau of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration, has recently created an "Automatic Grounding Prevention Predictor." When this instrument is used on a ship, it will immediately sound an alarm when the ship approaches a shoal, notifying the driver to change course.

Hundreds of cargo ships navigate the Yangtze River day and night, all sailing along the slow-flowing riverbanks. In the past, although sailors measured the depth of the water with bamboo poles day and night, rain or shine, grounding accidents still occurred frequently, accounting for 25% of all marine damage accidents. According to incomplete statistics from January 1951 to March of this year, the repair and rescue costs due to grounding amounted to more than 296.6 million yuan, delaying navigation for 1,062 hours, equivalent to one tugboat being docked for 44 days. Zhang Dingyan realized in supervising navigation safety that reducing grounding accidents was key to accelerating ship turnover. Therefore, he began designing in mid-May of this year, and the leadership promptly solved the problem of trial production funds for him. After six months of hard work and research, and more than 50 revisions of large and small drawings, he finally created the "Automatic Grounding Prevention Predictor." Currently, this instrument has been tested on the "Yangtze 140" tugboat, and the effect is very good. Zhou Xidu, the captain of this tugboat, said: "With the automatic predictor, we can boldly 'hug the shoals and navigate the gorges,' ensuring that we can improve sailing speed." The Administration Bureau plans to conduct further trials on the "402" and "403" tugboats, and then promote it widely. This "Automatic Grounding Prevention Predictor" is also suitable for navigating shallow riverbanks on the Songhua River and Pearl River in our country, and is of great value for accelerating ship turnover.

    张定言创造“防止搁浅自动预告器”
    长江航行管理局南京港务局航行监督组组长张定言最近创造了一种“防止搁浅自动预告器”。在轮船上使用这个仪器，当船接近暗滩时，它就会马上发出警报，通知驾驶员改变航路。
    在长江上日夜川流不息的航行着千百条货轮，这些货轮都在江边缓流航行。过去，水手们虽然不论白天黑夜、下雨下雪都用竹竿测量水的深度。但是搁浅事故仍不断发生，占全部海损事故的百分之二十五。据一九五一年一月至今年三月的不完全统计，因搁浅损失的修理费和营救费用，就有二亿九千六百多万元，耽误航行时间一千零六十二小时，等于一艘拖轮停泊四十四天。张定言在监督航行安全中体会到减少搁浅事故是加速航船周转的关键。因此，他从今年五月中旬就开始设计，领导方面也及时给他解决试制经费问题。经过他六个月的刻苦钻研，修改大小图样五十多次，终于创制了“防止搁浅自动预告器”。现在，这种仪器已在“长江一四○”号拖轮上试用，效果很好。这只拖轮上的正驾驶员周锡度说：“有了自动预告器，我们就可以大胆地‘抱滩走峡’，保证能提高航行速度。”管理局准备在“四○二”“四○三”两个拖轮上作进一步试用，然后普遍推广。这种“防止搁浅自动预告器”，也适用于我国松花江、珠江上的江边浅滩航行，对加速航船周转有很大价值。（本报江苏记者站）
