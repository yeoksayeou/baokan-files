    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 17th: According to TASS, the Soviet government's note to the French government has generated a great impact among people from all walks of life and political figures in France. Some French newspapers published the full text of the note, while others published detailed summaries. All newspapers published commentaries on the note.

    "L'Humanité" published the full text of the Soviet note and also published an editorial on the document. The editorial said: "The Soviet government has warned more than once that it will draw conclusions from the violation of the Franco-Soviet Treaty. Those who advocate arming Germany disregard this warning. They intend to use the Franco-Soviet Treaty as a cover to deceive public opinion, attempting to make public opinion believe that the Paris Agreements do not contradict this treaty." "L'Humanité" urged French parliamentarians to reject the London and Paris Agreements, to allow France to rely on the friendship of the Soviet Union, to occupy its own position in great power negotiations, and not to leave France isolated in the face of German militarism.

    An editorial in "Libération" said: "The Soviet government's warning further clarifies the position that the Soviet government will be forced to take, declaring the treaty invalid with respect to the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance, after the Paris Agreements are ratified. Therefore, when France is attacked by Germany, the Soviet Union has no obligation to help France. In this way, once Germany begins to arm, we will lose the only major military guarantee to prevent Germany from attacking our territory for the fourth time."

    The fact that the Soviet note has caused a great reaction in France has infuriated the right-wing newspapers that support the ratification of the Paris Agreements. But at the same time, right-wing newspapers are very worried that the note may have an impact on French society and members of parliament.

    "Le Figaro" was uneasy about the well-reasoned arguments in the Soviet note. "L'Armée" published a detailed summary of the Soviet note, with the title: "Moscow says: Ratification of the Paris Agreements means abolishing the Franco-Soviet Treaty."

    "L'Aurore" quoted Mendès-France as saying, "Because of the Soviet note, I do not intend to postpone the date on which the National Assembly begins the debate." But he also admitted that, due to the Franco-Soviet Treaty signed on December 10, 1944, France has an obligation not to participate in any alliance against the Soviet Union.

    "Combat" warned those politicians who believe that it will be easier to resume negotiations with the East after the West arms West Germany.

    The Soviet government's note immediately aroused a response from French parliamentarians. According to a report in "L'Humanité," a Socialist member of parliament said in the lounge of the French National Assembly on the 16th: "Now everything is clear. Now there is no need to argue in vain about the consequences of these agreements."

    Independent Republican General O'Mérain said: "The Soviet note did not surprise me. It is impossible to prepare to oppose someone with something while at the same time declaring yourself to be their friend. Similarly, one cannot prepare to use German troops against the Soviet Union while at the same time declaring oneself to be an ally of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union certainly does not want war, but it will not allow German troops to launch a war, because it knows the atrocities committed by German troops."

    Member of Parliament Louis Vallon said: "The measure announced by the Soviet government is in line with the warnings it previously made to us, which many people were unwilling to take seriously."

### 苏联致法国照会产生极大影响

    苏联致法国照会产生极大影响
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十七日讯：苏联政府给法国政府的照会在法国社会各界和政界人士中产生了极大的影响。法国报纸有的全文刊载了照会，有的详细登载了照会的摘要。各报都就照会发表了评论。
    “人道报”全文登载了苏联照会，并且就这一文件发表了社论。社论说：“苏联政府曾经不止一次地警告过，它将由法苏条约遭到破坏这一点作出结论。主张武装德国的人不顾这一警告。他们打算利用法苏条约作幌子来欺骗舆论，企图使舆论相信巴黎协定同这个条约并不矛盾。”“人道报”敦促法国议员们否决伦敦和巴黎协定，使法国依靠苏联的友谊，在大国谈判中占有自己的地位，而不使法国在德国军国主义面前陷于孤立。
    “解放报”社论说：“苏联政府的警告进一步明确地指出了巴黎协定被批准后苏联政府在法苏友好互助条约方面所不得不采取的宣布条约无效的立场。因此，当法国遭到德国进攻的时候，苏联就没有义务给法国帮助。这样，一旦德国开始武装，我们就会失掉唯一的一个重大的军事保障来防止德国第四次进攻我国的领土。”
    苏联照会在法国引起很大反应这件事，激怒了拥护批准巴黎协定的右派报纸。但是同时，右派报纸又十分担心：照会可能对法国社会各界和议员产生影响。
    “费加罗报”对苏联照会中理直气壮的论据感到不安。“义勇军报”详细摘要刊载了苏联的照会，它的标题是：“莫斯科说：批准巴黎协定，就要废除法苏条约。”
    “震旦报”援引孟戴斯—弗朗斯的话，他说，“由于苏联的照会，我不打算推迟国民议会开始辩论的日期了。”但是他又承认，由于一九四四年十二月十日签订的法苏条约，法国有义务不参加反对苏联的任何联盟。
    “战斗报”对那些相信当西方把西德武装起来以后就比较容易跟东方恢复谈判的政治家们提出了警告。
    苏联政府照会立即引起了法国议会人士的反应。据“人道报”报道，一个社会党议员十六日在法国国民议会休息室中说：“现在一切都清楚了。现在不必再徒劳无益地争论这些协定的后果了。”
    独立共和党议员奥麦朗将军说：“苏联照会没有使我惊奇。一方面准备以什么东西去反对人家，同时又宣布自己是他的朋友，这是办不到的。同样地，不能够一方面准备以德国军队反对苏联，另一方面又宣布自己是苏联的盟国。苏联当然不要战争，但是它更不会让德国军队发动战争，因为它知道德国军队所干下的暴行。”
    议员路易·伐隆说：“苏联政府所宣布的这一措施是吻合它以前向我们提出而为许多人所不愿意认真接受的警告的。”
