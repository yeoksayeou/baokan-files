　　Sino-Indian Cultural Exchange in a Warm Atmosphere

　　Since its arrival in India, the Chinese cultural delegation has been greeted everywhere with welcoming smiles, friendly hands, and fragrant garlands. During their stay in Delhi, they not only met with a large number of Indian audiences through large-scale performances, introducing them to Chinese art, but also made extensive contacts with more than one hundred Indian writers, poets, painters, and playwrights through symposiums and other means, exchanging experiences. At the first performance of the delegation in Delhi, the head of the delegation, Zheng Zhenduo, said that the Chinese cultural delegation would sincerely learn from Indian art. He also said: "On the one hand, we must sort out and promote the national artistic heritage, and on the other hand, we must absorb the essence of excellent art from all over the world."
　　It was with this spirit that the Chinese cultural delegation, on its way from Delhi to Mumbai, the largest city on the west coast of India, made a special trip to visit the famous Taj Mahal and the famous grottoes of Aurangabad in Hyderabad State.
　　The Taj Mahal is located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, and is the most famous ancient building in India. Premier Zhou Enlai visited it by plane during his tightly packed schedule when he visited India. While in Delhi, Prime Minister Nehru also told the members of the Chinese cultural delegation that the Taj Mahal is best viewed under the moonlight. The Chinese cultural delegation took a car from Agra Railway Station to the Taj Mahal at dawn on December 14. The Taj Mahal looked so beautiful and moving in the misty morning. From a distance, one can see the roof built of white marble, with four straight minaret towers as a foil at each corner. From the towering gate to the middle of the mausoleum, two rectangular pools are arranged side by side, with a fountain every five meters. On both sides of the pool are green lawns and neat tree-lined paths. The entire building gives a sense of serenity with its harmony.
　　The Taj Mahal was built by Emperor Shah Jahan of the Mughal Dynasty of India in memory of his beloved concubine. It is said that it took more than 20,000 people and took 23 years to complete. The marble walls inside the mausoleum are decorated with exquisite carvings and floral patterns inlaid with gems. The most elaborate flower is made of 64 small gems, and there are thousands upon thousands of exquisite floral patterns on the walls of the mausoleum, which are several feet high!
　　The Chinese cultural delegation arrived at Bopal Railway Station at 2:00 a.m. on December 15. As soon as the Chinese cultural delegation appeared, they were immediately surrounded by a jubilant crowd who had been waiting at the station for more than three hours. A woman walked out of the welcoming crowd, holding a plate of lights, came to Secretary-General Lou Shiyi, and smeared vermilion on his forehead with her thumb. Brigadier General Gaul, who hosted the Chinese cultural delegation, explained that this is the most noble national ritual of the Indian nation, a ritual of blessing from mothers and sisters for relatives who are going on expeditions or traveling far away.
　　The Chinese cultural delegation arrived at Jalgaon Railway Station on the 15th. It is the closest railway station to the famous Ajanta Caves. The delegation members squeezed out with great difficulty from the welcoming crowd of tens of thousands of people and transferred to a car to Ajanta. Ajanta is the place where Tang Xuanzang (Tripitaka) went to get Buddhist scriptures more than 1,300 years ago. After walking up hundreds of stone steps and turning into a canyon, a row of neat grottoes unfolded in front of us, with a total of twenty-nine, five of which were Buddhist temples and twenty-four were shrines. The Ajanta Caves were excavated in the 2nd century BC and took more than 800 years to complete. The Ajanta Caves are completely Buddhist architectural forms, chiseled from the outside to the inside from the entire solid cliff rock. The monastic rooms have colonnades and halls, with carvings on the pillars and vaults, cave rooms in the three stone walls, and a Buddhist hall in the center of the rear wall. The huge Buddha statues are all exquisitely carved. These grottoes are like a huge museum, with murals, sculptures, and architecture of a high artistic level, and the most striking are the world-famous murals. These murals can be roughly divided into three categories: decorative patterns, Buddha statues, and stories. Their style is lively and vigorous, the lines are meticulous, and the characters are vivid and lifelike.
　　Next, the Chinese cultural delegation visited Ellora Caves, another Indian masterpiece of art nearby. The Ellora Caves are located nineteen miles north of Aurangabad City. It is the only cave that includes three different religious components of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. There are thirty-four caves in total, all of which were carved out of hundreds of meters of cliffs by ancient Indian artists. Among the Ellora Caves, the most striking is the Kailasa Temple. It is the most representative masterpiece of architecture and sculpture art of the Maikuta Dynasty (3rd to 6th century AD). In Ajanta, only the carvings inside the Buddhist caves are seen, while the Kailasa Temple is a typical work of the development of Hindu sculpture and architecture into an open-air independent temple. The entire architecture of Kailasa Temple is chiseled from a complete large stone mountain 117 feet high and 297 feet long. The pavilions inside are uneven, the courtyards are well-organized, and the entire building is very magnificent and harmonious. This brilliant masterpiece of ancient Indian artists has greatly enriched the excellent artistic tradition of India.
　　After arriving in Mumbai, the Chinese cultural delegation met with many famous Indian cultural and artistic figures, and also watched the excellent Indian classical dances performed by famous Indian dancers such as Hima Kesaroti and the Jhaveri sisters. Many members of the Chinese cultural delegation squeezed out time to rest and talk with Indian artists and learn from each other. Our dancer Dai Ailian learned some basic movements of Indian dance from Kesaroti, and she also taught the basic steps of the "Lotus Dance" to Indian dancers. The famous Indian dancer Dina Kalidas Gandhi, who had visited China, personally taught our actors to dance the Gujarati dance, and at the same time, he also learned the Red Silk Dance from our actors.
　　The performances of the Chinese cultural delegation in Delhi and Mumbai were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in India. Indian audiences generally believe that Chinese art is easy to understand because there are many significant commonalities between the arts of China and India. China's famous Peking operas "Havoc in Heaven", "Autumn River", "San Cha Kou", "Stealing the Immortal Herb", etc. have become popular programs for Indian audiences. The dance programs such as "Lotus Dance", "Picking Tea and Chasing Butterflies" and "Grandfather Carries Grandson" performed by Dai Ailian have also been warmly praised by the Indian people. The delegation sang "Indo-China Friendship Song" and "Salute to Mother" (both Indian songs) in Indian, and the Yunnan folk song sung by Huang Hong, as well as the pipa played by Wei Zhongle and Sun Yude, were all hailed as "heart-stirring" programs by Indian newspaper critics. Many Indian friends excitedly talked about the similarities between the South Indian Kathakali local opera and the Chinese Peking Opera. China's famous Peking Opera actors Li Shaochun, Yuan Shihai, Ye Shengzhang and other famous actors of the Indian Kathakali, Krishna Kuti, had specific conversations about performance methods and experience.
　　The literary and artistic policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new" of Chairman Mao Zedong, embodied in the performances of the Chinese cultural delegation, has been universally valued by the Indian cultural and artistic circles. At a reception in Delhi, Rajamannar, the director of the National Academy of Music, Dance and Art of India, strongly expressed this common opinion, saying: I think what is extremely important is the famous saying of your People's Government: "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new."

    中印文化在热烈的气氛中交流
    新华社驻新德里记者　孔迈
      中国文化代表团自从到印度以来，到处遇见欢迎的笑容、友谊的手和芳香的花环。在德里期间，他们不但通过大规模的演出同众多的印度观众见面，向他们介绍了中国艺术，同时也通过座谈和其他方式，同印度的一百多位作家、诗人、画家、戏剧家们进行了广泛接触，交流了经验。郑振铎团长在代表团在德里举行首次演出时说，中国文化代表团要诚恳地向印度的艺术学习。他还说：“我们一方面要整理发扬民族的艺术遗产，另一方面也要吸收世界各国优秀艺术的精华。”
    正是抱着这种精神，中国文化代表团在离开德里前往印度西海岸最大城市孟买途中，又特别去参观了著名的泰吉·玛哈尔陵和海得拉巴邦阿兰迦巴的著名石窟。
    泰吉·玛哈尔陵在北方省亚格拉，是印度最著名的古代建筑。周恩来总理访问印度时，曾在排得很紧的日程中乘飞机去参观过。在德里时，尼赫鲁总理也告诉中国文化代表团人员们，看泰吉·玛哈尔陵最好要在月光下看。中国文化代表团在十二月十四日天刚亮时从亚格拉火车站乘汽车赶到泰吉·玛哈尔陵。泰吉·玛哈尔陵在迷濛的晨雾中，显得那样美丽动人。从远处就可以望到用白色大理石建造的屋顶，四角陪衬着四座笔直的尖顶塔。从高耸的大门到陵墓中间，并排着两个长方形的水池，每隔五公尺，就有一座喷泉。水池两旁是油绿的草地和整齐的林荫道。整个建筑，以它的协调给人一种心旷神怡的感觉。
    泰吉·玛哈尔陵是印度莫卧儿王朝沙日汉皇帝为纪念他的爱妃而建造的。据说共动用了二万多人，经过二十三年才建成。陵墓内部周围大理石墙壁上，饰满了精致的雕刻和镶嵌着宝石的花卉图案，最工细的一朵花是用六十四颗小宝石合组而成的，而陵墓高达数丈的墙壁上精致的花卉图案不知有几千几万个！
    中国文化代表团在十二月十五日清晨两点多钟到达波保尔车站。中国文化代表团刚一露面，马上就被已在车站等候了三个多小时的欢腾的人群簇拥出去。欢迎的人群中走出一位妇女，端着一盘灯火来到楼适夷秘书长面前，用大拇指蘸了朱砂在他的眉际上一抹。招待中国文化代表团的高尔准将解释说，这是印度民族最尊贵的民族仪式，是母亲、姐妹为亲人出征或远行而祝福的仪式。
    中国文化代表团十五日到达贾尔冈车站。它是离开著名的阿旃陀石窟最近的火车站。代表团人员在万人夹道的欢迎行列中，好容易才挤出去，转乘汽车去阿旃陀。阿旃陀是一千三百多年前唐玄奘取经到过的地方。走上成百的石级转入一处峡谷后，眼前就展开了一排排整齐的石窟，共有二十九处，其中五处是佛殿，二十四处是神室。阿旃陀石窟开掘于纪元前二世纪，历时八百多年才完成。阿旃陀石窟完全是佛教建筑形式，是把整座坚固的崖石，自外向内凿成的。僧室有柱廊和大厅，柱上和仰顶上都有雕饰，三面石壁内有洞室，后壁正中有佛堂，巨大佛像都雕刻得很精致。这些石窟好像一座巨大的博物院，这里有达到高度艺术水平的壁画、雕刻和建筑，而最引人注意的就是世界闻名的壁画。这些壁画大体可分为装饰图案、佛像和故事三类，它们的气派作风活泼雄健，线条工细，人物情态传神逼真。
    接着，中国文化代表团参观了附近的印度另一艺术杰作爱楼罗石窟。爱楼罗石窟在阿兰迦巴城北十九英里，它是唯一包括了佛教、印度教和耆那教三种不同宗教成分的石窟，共有三十四处，都是古代印度艺术家从几百公尺的悬崖峭壁上雕凿出来的。爱楼罗石窟中，最引人注目的是喀拉萨神殿。它是麦多王朝（公元后三世纪至六世纪）建筑、雕刻艺术中最具有代表性的杰作。在阿旃陀只是看到佛教洞窟内部的雕刻，而在喀拉萨神殿却是印度教雕刻建筑艺术发展为露天的独立庙宇的典型作品。喀拉萨整个庙宇的建筑是由一块高一百一十七英尺、长二百九十七英尺的完整的大石山凿成的。里面楼阁参差，庭院井然，整个建筑十分富丽和谐。印度古代艺术家这一光辉的杰作大大丰富了印度优秀的艺术传统。
    到孟买后，中国文化代表团又和许多著名的印度文化艺术界人士见面，同时也观赏了印度著名舞蹈家希玛·克萨罗蒂和杳维里姐妹等著名演员表演的印度优秀古典舞蹈。中国文化代表团许多团员并挤出休息时间来和印度艺术工作者在一起交谈和互相学习。我国舞蹈家戴爱莲向克萨罗蒂学习了印度舞蹈的一些基本动作，同时她也把“荷花舞”的基本步法教给印度舞蹈家。曾经访问我国的印度著名舞蹈家迪纳·卡利达斯·甘地亲自教我国演员跳古吉莱特舞，同时他还向我国演员学习红绸舞。
    中国文化代表团在德里和孟买的演出受到印度各阶层人民的热烈欢迎。印度观众普遍认为中国艺术容易了解，因为中印两国的艺术有许多显著的共同点。我国的著名京剧“闹天宫”、“秋江”、“三岔口”、“盗仙草”等已成为印度观众普遍喜爱的节目。“荷花舞”、“采茶扑蝶”以及戴爱莲表演的“祖背孙”等舞蹈节目也受到印度人民热烈的赞扬。代表团用印度语言歌唱“印中友好歌”、“向母亲致敬”（都是印度歌曲），黄虹唱的云南民歌，以及衞仲乐和孙裕德演奏的琵琶都被印度报纸的剧评称为“动人心弦”的节目。许多印度朋友兴奋地谈论着南印度卡塔卡里地方戏和中国京剧相似的特点。我国著名京剧演员李少春、袁世海、叶盛章等和印度卡塔卡里的著名演员克里什纳·库蒂具体地交谈了表演方法和经验。
    中国文化代表团的演出所体现出来的毛泽东主席的“百花齐放，推陈出新”的文艺方针尤其受到了印度文化艺术界普遍的重视。在德里的一次欢迎会上，印度全国音乐舞蹈艺术学院院长拉贾曼纳尔就有力地表达了这种普遍的意见，他说：我认为极为重要的就是你们人民政府的名言：“百花齐放，推陈出新。”
