The responsible person of the All-China Youth Federation stated:
    Ignoring the repeated warnings of the Chinese people, U.S. imperialism flagrantly signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique on December 2nd. Our 120 million youth, like the people of the entire nation, are extremely indignant and resolutely oppose this war treaty aimed at invading our territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands and preparing for a new war of aggression.

    Chinese youth fully support our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The U.S. government has been undermining international agreements such as the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," which it itself participated in signing, occupying our territory of Taiwan, and supporting and directing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the public enemy of the Chinese people, to conduct harassing and destructive warfare against our mainland and coastal islands. This time, it has even more blatantly signed a treaty of aggression, attempting to legalize the act of invading Taiwan. It is very clear that these sinful actions of U.S. imperialism are aimed at being the enemy of the 600 million Chinese people. U.S. imperialism not only extremely hates the new China of the people, but is also extremely afraid of the new China of the people, and therefore has adopted various despicable means, vainly attempting to achieve the goal of subverting new China.

    Taiwan is Chinese territory, the people of Taiwan are Chinese compatriots, and the youth of Taiwan are our brothers and sisters. We must fully support the struggle of our government and the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan, in order to complete the unification of the sacred territory and sovereignty of the motherland, and rescue our Taiwan compatriots from their dire situation.

    The liberation of Taiwan is a just struggle of the Chinese people, a struggle to defend peace in the Far East and the world. U.S. imperialism's attempt to use force to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and to threaten the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan with a new war, is completely impossible.

    As everyone knows, no force has ever been able to intimidate the Chinese people and Chinese youth. Chinese youth have never grown up under the humiliation of the enemy, but have grown up in the victorious struggle against enemies at home and abroad. Chinese youth love peace and greatly cherish today's peaceful and happy life, but they are never afraid of wars of aggression. If the enemy dares to invade our territory and provoke war to destroy our peaceful and happy life, the youth of our country will give the enemy the punishment they deserve, just as they have done in the past.

    Chinese youth are determined to transform anger into the power of combat, strengthening our work, studying hard, exercising, and being vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies in our respective posts, and preparing to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, to contribute all our strength to liberating Taiwan and completing the unification of the motherland's territory.

### 中华全国民主青年联合会负责人的谈话

    中华全国民主青年联合会负责人的谈话
    美帝国主义不顾中国人民的屡次警告，悍然在十二月二日和蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”。我们一亿二千万青年和全国人民一样，以极端愤怒的心情，坚决反对这个以侵略我国领土台湾和澎湖列岛并准备新的侵略战争为目的的战争条约。
    中国青年完全拥护我国周恩来外长关于美蒋
  “共同防御条约”的声明。美国政府一直在破坏它自己参加签订的“开罗宣言”、“波茨坦公告”等国际协议，侵占我国领土台湾，支持和指使中国人民的公敌蒋介石卖国集团，对我国大陆和沿海岛屿进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争。这次更明目张胆地签订了侵略条约，企图使侵略台湾的行为合法化。事实十分明显，美帝国主义这些罪恶行动是以六亿中国人民为敌的，美帝国主义不仅极端仇视人民的新中国，而且极端害怕人民的新中国，因此采取了各种卑劣手段，妄想达到颠覆新中国的目的。
    台湾是中国的领土，台湾的人民是中国的同胞，台湾的青年是我们的兄弟姐妹。我们一定要以全力支持我国政府和人民解放军解放台湾的斗争，以完成祖国神圣领土主权的统一，拯救台湾的同胞于水深火热之中。
    解放台湾是中国人民的正义斗争，是保卫远东和世界和平的斗争。美帝国主义企图以武力阻止中国人民解放台湾，用新战争威吓中国人民解放台湾，是完全办不到的。
    大家知道，任何武力从来没有能够吓倒中国人民和中国青年。中国青年从来就不是在敌人的屈辱下长大的，而是在反对内外敌人的胜利斗争中成长起来的。中国青年热爱和平，并十分珍视今天的和平幸福生活，但决不害怕侵略战争。如果敌人胆敢侵犯我国领土，挑起战争来破坏我们的和平幸福生活，我们全国青年就会像过去一样给敌人以应得的惩罚。
    中国青年决心化愤怒为战斗的力量，在各自的岗位上，加强工作，努力学习，锻炼身体，时刻警惕敌人的阴谋活动，并准备随时响应祖国的召唤，为解放台湾完成祖国领土的统一贡献自己的一切力量。
