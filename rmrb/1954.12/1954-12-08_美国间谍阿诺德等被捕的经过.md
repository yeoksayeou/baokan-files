The circumstances surrounding the capture of American spies Arnold and others in Northeast China have recently been investigated by Xinhua News Agency reporters.

All those interviewed were eyewitnesses to the events. The investigation confirms that the American representative to the United Nations, Mr. Lodge, in an explanatory memorandum to the UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, claimed that the plane carrying American spies Arnold and others was "attacked and shot down fifteen miles south of the Yalu River near Sunchon in North Korea." This is purely fabricated. Witnesses confirmed that the location where these American spies were shot down and captured was not south of the Yalu River, but within the territory of Liaoning Province, China, north of the Yalu River.

The Xinhua News Agency reporter visited farmers in the villages of Xinkang, Laogugou, and Huangwan, at the foot of Wulong Mountain (also known as Dingqi Mountain), more than twenty kilometers northwest of Andong City, Liaoning Province, who recounted the events of January 13, 1953, when Arnold, Baumer, and nine other American spies were captured.

Wang Jisheng, a 39-year-old farmer and militia leader from Xinkang Village, told the reporter: "On the evening of January 12, 1953, around 9:00 PM, I was returning home after a village cadre meeting. Just as I entered the courtyard, I saw a fireball falling in the northwest direction. At the time, I didn't hear any noise, so I went inside and went to sleep. The next morning, around 5:00 AM, militia member Wang Shizhong reported to me that Wang Jinyu's daughter, Wang Shulan, had found a parachute on a tree in front of her house. I immediately sent someone to report to the Wulongbei District People's Government and organized more than a dozen militiamen and young farmers to search the mountain. Around 5:30 AM, I and two militiamen walked less than half a kilometer out of the village and saw another parachute next to the Choulu Ditch. As I was carefully observing it, I noticed a person sitting under a pine tree about twenty steps away from the parachute, covered in blood. When he saw us, he immediately raised his hands high. After we went forward and took the pistol from his satchel, we found that his leg was injured and he couldn't walk. We carried him to Wang Jinyu's house on a door panel. Later, we learned that he was William H. Baumer."

Less than one kilometer north of Wang Jinyu's house lives a farmer named He Liangui. He told the reporter: "On the morning of the 13th, my wife, He Li, went outside the yard to get firewood for cooking. She saw a strange foreigner and immediately called me. When I came out and took a look, the person ran towards Choulu Ditch. So I monitored him while telling my wife to report to the village chief. Later, the village chief sent people to catch the American spy."

That morning, farmers in Xinkang Village captured a total of four American spies and detained them all in Wang Jinyu's house.

In Laogugou Village, four kilometers east of Xinkang Village, the village chief Guo Zhenjiang described the situation at the time: "On the morning of January 13th last year, Shi Changfu's son, Shi Jihui, was on his way to school when he walked past the Laogugou River, two kilometers northwest of the village, and found the corpse of an American. He immediately reported to the militia member Chen Jigui. Subsequently, the whole village began a large-scale mountain search. On that day, in addition to finding the corpse of an American, we also captured three American spies in our village."

Cai Xihou, the militia squad leader of Laogugou Village, recounted the capture of Arnold: "On the 13th, we searched the mountains for half a day and found nothing. Around 4:00 PM, I led several militiamen and young farmers to a ridge of Wulong Mountain, and suddenly discovered a large American, about forty years old, with a piece of red parachute cloth tied around his neck. At the time, I circled behind this American, and several others surrounded him from the side. I flashed behind an oak tree and shouted, 'Hands up!' The American was so scared that he quickly raised both hands, and we captured him alive just like that. Later, we learned that he was Colonel Arnold, the commander of the American '581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing.'"

On the same day, farmers in Huangwan Village, five kilometers northwest of Xinkang Village, also captured four American spies. Li Jiang, the wife of middle-aged farmer Li Yongcai from this village, said: "That morning, around 6:00 AM, my husband hadn't returned from winter school, and I saw an American walking towards me in front of my house. It was very cold at the time, and I saw him shivering all over. He used gestures to indicate that he was hungry and asked me for food, so I brought him into the house. While he was warming himself by the fire, I slipped out to report to the militia, who quickly arrived and captured him."

West of Huangwan Village, the reporter also visited farmers in Yushuzi Village, thirty-three kilometers northwest of Andong City. On the south mountain of their village, they found the wreckage of the American B-29 aircraft that had been shot down by us on the evening of January 12, 1953, and the bodies of two American spies. Wang Qishu, a 67-year-old man, saw the wreckage of the plane and the corpse of an American hanging from a tree next to the wreckage at the time.

    美国间谍阿诺德等被捕的经过
    新华社记者最近调查了美国间谍阿诺德等在我国东北地区被捕获的经过情形。
    被调查的人全部是当时情景的目击者。调查的结果证明：美国驻联合国代表洛奇在交给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的一份解释性备忘录中所提到的，美国间谍阿诺德等所乘坐的飞机是“在鸭绿江以南十五英里邻近北朝鲜顺川的地方受到袭击并被击落”纯系凭空捏造。目击者证实，这些美国间谍被击落和被捕获的地点，不是在鸭绿江以南，而是在鸭绿江以北的中国辽宁省境内。
    新华社记者访问的是我国辽宁省安东市西北二十多公里的五龙山（又名丁琪山）山麓的新康、老古沟、荒湾等村庄的农民，他们向记者叙述了在一九五三年一月十三日捕捉阿诺德、包莫等十一名美国间谍的情形。
    新康村有一位三十九岁的农民、民兵队长王吉生，他向记者说：“在一九五三年一月十二日晚上九点多钟，我开完村干部会回家，刚到院子里，看见空中有一个火球在西北方向落下，当时我没听到一点动静，就进屋里睡下了。第二天早上五点钟左右，民兵王世忠向我报告，说王金玉女儿王淑兰发现她家门口的树上落着一个降落伞。我当时就一面派人去五龙背区人民政府报告，一面组织了十几名民兵和青年农民上山搜查。五点半钟左右，我和两个民兵走出村子不到一里地，在臭鲁沟旁又看到一个降落伞。我正在仔细观察的时候，发现在离降落伞二十多步远的一棵松树下面坐着一个人，他满身是血；当他看见我们的时候，立刻把双手高高举起来。我们上前从他身上的皮囊里把手枪解下来以后，发现他的腿受伤不能走，我们用门板把他抬到王金玉的家里。后来才知道他就是威廉·赫尔·包莫。”
    在王金玉家以北不到一公里的地方，住有一个叫何连贵的农民。他向记者说：“十三日那天早晨，我的妻子何李氏到院外取柴烧饭，看见一个奇怪的外国人，当时她就叫我，我出来一看，那个人就向臭鲁沟跑走了。于是我一面监视着他，一面叫我妻子向村长报告。后来，村长派人赶上去把这个美国间谍抓住了。”
    这天早晨七点钟，新康村农民共捉了四名美国间谍，全部押在王金玉的家里。
    在新康村以东四公里的老古沟村，村长郭振江向记者介绍了当时的情况说：“去年一月十三日早晨，农民施长福的儿子施吉惠在上学的时候，走到村子西北二公里的老古沟河旁，发现一具美国人的尸体，当时他就向民兵陈吉贵报告了。随后，全村人便开始了大搜山。当天我们村除发现一具美国人的尸体以外，还捉了三个美国间谍。”
    老古沟村的民兵分队长蔡喜厚向记者叙述了阿诺德被捉的经过，他说：“十三日上午我们在山上搜查了半天，没发现任何东西。下午四点多钟我又率领几个民兵和青年农民走到五龙山一个支脉的山岗上，突然发现一个大个子美国人，年纪有四十岁左右，脖子上还拴了一块红色的降落伞布。当时我迂回在这个美国人的背后，另外几个人从侧面包围，我闪在一棵柞树后面大喊一声：‘举起手来！’这个美国人吓得赶快举起双手，他就这样被我们活活捉回来了。后来我们才知道他就是美国‘五八一空中补给与通讯联队’上校司令官阿诺德。”
    同一天，在新康村西北五公里的荒湾村，农民们也捕捉了四个美国间谍。这个村的中年农民李永才的妻子李姜氏说：“那天早晨六点多钟，我丈夫上冬学还没回来，我在房前看见一个美国人向我走来。当时天气很冷，我看见他冻的浑身发抖，并用手势说明肚子饿了，向我要东西吃，我就把他带到屋子里，趁他烤火的时候，我溜出去向民兵报告，民兵很快赶来把他抓住了。”
    在荒湾村西面，记者还访问了在安东市西北三十三公里的榆树子村的农民们。他们在自己村庄的南山上，发现了在一九五三年一月十二日晚间被我击落的那架美国B—29型飞机的残骸和两具美国间谍的尸体。六十七岁的老人王启书当时就看到了那里的飞机残骸和在飞机残骸旁边的一棵树上悬挂着的一具美国人的尸体。（新华社）
