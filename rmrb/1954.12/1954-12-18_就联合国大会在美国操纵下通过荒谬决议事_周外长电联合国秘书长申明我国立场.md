    Regarding the United Nations General Assembly Passing an Absurd Resolution Under U.S. Manipulation, Foreign Minister Zhou Cables the UN Secretary-General to Declare China's Position

    [Xinhua News Agency, December 17th] China's Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai cabled UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on December 17th, regarding the absurd resolution passed by the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly under the manipulation of the United States, "Accusing the Violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement of Detaining and Imprisoning United Nations Military Personnel," to declare the position of the Chinese government. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

    To Mr. Hammarskjöld, Secretary-General of the United Nations, New York:

    On December 10, 1954, the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States and its followers, passed the absurd resolution "Accusing the Violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement of Detaining and Imprisoning United Nations Military Personnel," slandering China's sentencing of eleven American spies as a violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The Government of the People's Republic of China expresses its resolute opposition to this.

    These eleven and two other American spies intruded into Chinese territory and were captured within Chinese territory. The Chinese courts reviewed various pieces of evidence and confirmed that they had engaged in espionage activities in China, and sentenced them according to law on November 23, 1954. China's sentencing of foreign spies captured within Chinese territory is China's internal affair. The United Nations does not condemn the United States for violating the UN Charter by sending spies to invade China and carry out subversive activities; instead, it attempts to interfere with China's sentencing of American spies based on conclusive evidence, which is completely unreasonable.

    This case has nothing to do with the issue of Korean prisoners of war. If the issue of Korean prisoners of war is mentioned, then it is the United States and the United Nations forces that violated the Korean Armistice Agreement. The U.S. government condoned the Syngman Rhee clique's blatant sabotage of the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war, forcibly detaining more than 27,000 captured North Korean and Chinese personnel in June 1953. In January 1954, the United Nations forces, disregarding the decision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea, abducted more than 21,000 captured North Korean and Chinese personnel and incorporated them into the armies of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. These cases have not yet been accounted for. The Chinese and Korean people will never forget the suffering their children endured under the tyranny of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee. The United Nations, under the clamor and manipulation of the United States, turns a blind eye to the tragic detention and abduction of more than 48,000 captured North Korean and Chinese personnel, but instead groundlessly slanders China's sentencing of eleven American spies. This cannot but make the Chinese people feel great indignation.

    The purpose of the U.S. government's clamoring is to incite hostility and hatred towards China, in order to cover up the U.S.'s aggressive acts of creating the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" and occupying Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and to obstruct China's accusations against the U.S.'s armed aggression against Chinese territory. This activity of the United States is an integral part of its creation of international tensions in the East and West and its preparation for a new war. The Chinese people oppose war, but will never be intimidated by war threats. The Chinese people demand peace, but will never beg for peace at the cost of their own territory and sovereignty. Therefore, no clamoring by the United States can shake China's solemn position of exercising its sovereignty to sentence American spies.

    Mr. Secretary-General, I request you to distribute the full text of this telegram to all delegations attending the United Nations General Assembly, except for the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang.

                          Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
                                    December 17, 1954, Beijing

    就联合国大会在美国操纵下通过荒谬决议事
    周外长电联合国秘书长申明我国立场
    【新华社十七日讯】我国外交部长周恩来于十二月十七日致电联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，就联合国大会第九届会议在美国操纵下通过“控诉违反朝鲜停战协定拘留和监禁联合国军事人员”的荒谬决议一事，申明我国政府的立场。电报全文如下：纽约联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生：
    一九五四年十二月十日联合国大会第九届会议在美国和它的追随者的操纵之下，通过了“控诉违反朝鲜停战协定拘留和监禁联合国军事人员”的荒谬决议，诬蔑中国判处十一名美国间谍案件为违反朝鲜停战协定。对此，中华人民共和国政府表示坚决反对。
    这十一名和另外两名美国间谍是侵入中国境内并在中国境内捕获的。中国法院审查了各种证据，确证他们在中国进行间谍活动，已在一九五四年十一月二十三日对他们依法判刑。中国判处在中国境内捕获的外国间谍的案件，是中国的内政问题。联合国不去谴责美国违反联合国宪章派遣间谍侵入中国进行颠覆活动，反而企图干涉中国判处证据确凿的美国间谍案件，是完全没有道理的。
    这个案件同朝鲜战俘问题没有任何关系。如果提到朝鲜战俘问题，那么，违反朝鲜停战协定的却是美国和联合国军方面。美国政府纵容李承晚集团公然破坏关于遣返战俘的协定，在一九五三年六月强迫扣留二万七千余名朝中被俘人员。在一九五四年一月，联合国军又不顾朝鲜中立国遣返委员会的决定，劫夺二万一千余名朝中被俘人员，编入李承晚和蒋介石的军队。这些案件至今尚未交代。中国人民和朝鲜人民永远不会忘记他们这些子弟在蒋介石和李承晚的暴政下所遭受的苦难。联合国在美国的叫嚣和操纵下，对于四万八千余名朝中被俘人员的惨遭扣留和劫夺置若罔闻，反而对于中国判处十一名美国间谍案件横加诬蔑，这不能不使中国人民感到极大的愤慨。
    美国政府叫嚣的目的是在于煽动对中国的敌视和仇恨，借以掩盖美国制造美蒋“共同防御条约”、霸占台湾和澎湖的侵略行为，并阻挠中国对于美国武装侵略中国领土的控诉。美国的这种活动是它在东方和西方制造国际紧张局势、准备新的战争的一个组成部分。中国人民反对战争，但是决不会被战争威胁吓倒。中国人民要求和平，但是决不会拿自己的领土和主权作代价乞求和平。因此，美国的任何叫嚣，都不能动摇中国行使自己的主权判处美国间谍的严正立场。
    秘书长先生，我请您把这个电报的全文分发给除蒋介石国民党代表以外的、出席联合国大会的各国代表团。
                          中华人民共和国外交部长　周恩来
                                    一九五四年十二月十七日　北京
