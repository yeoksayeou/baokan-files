    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 24th: TASS, Paris, December 23rd—As the French National Assembly continues to debate the ratification of the London and Paris Accords, more and more delegations of French workers are petitioning the National Assembly.
    The delegations delivered protests with signatures of hundreds of thousands of people opposing the militarization of West Germany to the members of parliament. During breaks in the sessions, many representatives often surrounded the parliamentarians near the National Assembly building, demanding that they vote against the ratification of the Paris Accords.
    As "l'Humanité" emphasized: a wave of short strikes against the West German militarization plan is unfolding more and more turbulently in the country. On December 22, workers in many enterprises stopped work: workers at a gas plant in the Villette district of Paris, workers at many steel mills in Lyon, coal miners in Bousquet-d'Orb (Hérault), workers at the "Hispano-Suiza" automobile factory in Bois-Colombes on the outskirts of Paris, and workers at many other factories.
    On December 22, the Peace Defense Committee organized a mass meeting of 1,500 Parisian residents at the "Palais de la Mutualité." Speakers included Chatagner, editor-in-chief of the Catholic bi-weekly magazine, Pichon, member of the Versailles Municipal Council and member of the Gaullist party, and Jean-Paul Sartre, a famous French writer, who called for intensified opposition to the arming of Germany. The assembly listened very carefully to their speeches.
    The General Confederation of Labor Executive Bureau wrote a letter to the members of the National Assembly. The letter stated: "The working people of our country want peace and an end to the arms race, because the arms race places a heavy burden on the working people. They want a policy that leads to general and supervised disarmament and opens up prospects for improving their material conditions and social progress. …"
    The letter emphasized that the French working class unanimously demands that the parliamentarians reject the London and Paris Accords and that they vote in favor of immediate negotiations between the four major powers to discuss the German question.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: According to TASS, Paris: The scale of the French people's protest against the re-militarization of West Germany is expanding day by day. The country continues to actively collect signatures for petitions and resolutions protesting the arming of the Bonn revanchists. These documents are delivered to parliamentarians at any time.
    On the 23rd alone, sixty delegations from the residents of Montreuil, a suburb of Paris, went to the National Assembly. A delegation from the Isère province told the parliamentarians that, in their province, 80,000 residents had signed a resolution demanding that the National Assembly reject the Paris Accords.
    The Seine Provincial Peace Committee issued a notice to residents on the 23rd, stating: The scale of the French people's protest against the Paris Accords has faithfully reflected the will of the nation. Petitions, delegations, strikes, signature collection: all of this proves that France will never agree to the revival of German militarism. The rapid rise and power of the people's protest movement requires parliamentarians to take responsibility for the country and tells them that it is necessary and possible to implement a policy of negotiation and peace. The Seine Provincial Peace Committee calls on the men and women of Paris to continue to strengthen the struggle, and to redouble their efforts at this crucial moment.

    反对复活西德军国主义的巴黎协定
    法国人民的抗议运动迅速高涨
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十三日讯：正当法国国民议会在继续辩论批准伦敦和巴黎协定的问题的时候，法国劳动者代表团前往国民议会请愿的越来越多了。
    代表团把有着成千上万的人签名的、反对西德军国主义化的抗议书交给议员。在会议休息的时候，国民议会大厦附近时常有许多代表围住议员，要求他们投票反对批准巴黎协定。
    正如“人道报”着重指出的：为反对西德军国主义化计划而举行短时间罢工的浪潮在国内日益汹涌地展开。在十二月二十二日停工的有许多企业的劳动者：巴黎维莱特区的一个煤气厂的工人、里昂的许多炼钢厂的工人、布斯克—多尔布（爱罗尔省）的煤矿工人、巴黎城郊布阿科波姆布的“伊斯帕诺—苏伊查”汽车工厂的工人和其他许多工厂的工人。
    十二月二十二日，保卫和平委员会在“团结宫”组织了由一千五百个巴黎居民参加的群众大会。在会上发言的有天主教“双周”杂志主编沙塔尼埃，凡尔赛市政委员会委员、戴高乐党党员皮雄，法国著名作家让·保罗·萨特等人，他们号召加紧反对武装德国，大会十分注意地听了他们的发言。
    总工会执行局写信给国民议会的议员。信中说：“我国劳动人民希望和平，希望停止扩充军备，因为扩充军备使劳动人民背着沉重的负担。他们希望实现导致普遍和有监督的裁军、并且为他们开辟改善物质状况和社会进步前景的政策。……”
    信中强调指出，法国工人阶级一致要求议员否决伦敦和巴黎协定，要求他们赞成立即举行四大国的谈判，讨论德国问题。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国人民抗议西德重新军国主义化的运动的规模日益扩大。全国继续积极为抗议武装波恩复仇主义者的请愿书和决议书征集签名。这些文件随时交给议员们。
    在二十三日这一天，仅仅巴黎郊区蒙特勒伊的居民就有六十个代表团到国民议会去。伊塞尔省的代表团对议员说，在它们本省里面，有八万居民在决议书上签了名，要求国民议会否决巴黎协定。
    塞纳省和平委员会二十三日发表告居民书说：法国人民抗议巴黎协定的规模已经忠实地反映出全国的意志。发请愿书，派代表团，罢工，征集签名：这一切都证明了法国永远不同意复活德国军国主义。人民抗议运动的迅速高涨和威势要议员们对国家负起责任，并且告诉他们有必要而且也有可能执行谈判和和平的政策。塞纳省和平委员会号召巴黎男女继续加强斗争，在这个决定性的关头特别加强努力。
