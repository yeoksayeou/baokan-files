    The U.S. aggressive bloc's interference in the Vietnam situation is becoming increasingly blatant. Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in answering questions from a reporter of the French magazine "l'Observateur," sternly denounced the shameless interference of the U.S. aggressive bloc. The statement of Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on December 5 regarding the mission of U.S. General Collins, and the memorandum of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army on the same day regarding violations of the armistice agreement committed in the areas of concentration of French Union forces, particularly concerning the mission of U.S. General Collins, have exposed with irrefutable facts the U.S. aggressive bloc's plot to undermine the Indochina armistice agreement and intensify its interference in Vietnam. Peace-loving people around the world and fair-minded public opinion in all countries should closely watch these facts.

    As everyone knows, the Geneva Conference reached an agreement to end hostilities and restore peace in Indochina based on the recognition of the national rights of the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The whole world welcomed this agreement. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has earnestly implemented the Geneva Conference agreement. President Ho Chi Minh has repeatedly stated that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam agrees with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence initiated by the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers, and hopes to apply these five principles in the relations between Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia, as well as other countries. Thanks to the efforts of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese and French sides have reached an agreement on the continued operation of French enterprises within the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These efforts by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demonstrate the unwavering desire of the Vietnamese people to implement the Geneva Conference agreement and safeguard their national independence and sovereignty, and are also an important contribution to expanding peace in Southeast Asia.

    However, the U.S. aggressive bloc has openly adopted the opposite attitude towards the Geneva Conference agreement. U.S. President Eisenhower once unreservedly stated that the United States "did not like" the Geneva Conference agreement and said that the United States was "not bound by this decision." After the Geneva Conference, the United States gathered Britain, France, and other countries in Manila to sign the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty." This treaty, manufactured by the United States, unilaterally declared that South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia were included within the "protection" scope of the Southeast Asia military bloc. This is a clear violation of the Geneva Conference agreement regarding the prohibition of Indochinese countries from participating in any military bloc. The "Pakistan Times," in commenting on the Manila Treaty, pointed out that this war treaty was "an open violation of the important provision in the Geneva Agreement concerning the prohibition of Indochinese countries from concluding military alliances with any country." Clearly, this approach by the U.S. aggressive bloc is aimed at obstructing the implementation of the Geneva Conference agreement, undermining peace in Indochina, and plotting to turn the Indochinese countries into its colonies and military bases.

    To further realize the aggressive aims of the Manila Treaty, the U.S. aggressive bloc has recently intensified its interference activities in South Vietnam. To this end, the U.S. government recently dispatched former U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Collins, who participated in planning the Korean War, to Saigon to serve as a special envoy to South Vietnam. According to reports from U.S. and British news agencies, Collins' mission is to militarily and politically strengthen the South Vietnam Ngo Dinh Diem clique, interfere in Vietnam's internal affairs, and obstruct Vietnam's unification.

    Indeed, this is precisely the case. Just four days after Collins arrived in Saigon, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles admitted that Collins was in Saigon "intensely studying what work can be done in the military aspect." Collins also bluntly stated on November 17 that his special mission to South Vietnam was to "give the Ngo Dinh Diem government unconditional American support" and to "assist this government in every possible way." This "assistance" mainly includes "training Vietnamese troops by a U.S. advisory group," and the equipment for these troops "will be 90 percent American." The U.S. "New York Post" has openly revealed that Collins is studying how to handle the 1.9 million tons of American weapons and ammunition, worth over two billion U.S. dollars, that have already been shipped to South Vietnam. U.S. news agencies further reported that, starting from January 1 next year, the United States will bypass France and directly provide military "aid" to the Indochinese countries, of which the "aid" to the South Vietnam Ngo Dinh Diem clique will reach 300 million U.S. dollars. It is worth noting that while the United States is stepping up "aid" to the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, it also plans to begin on January 1 next year to "take over" the training rights of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's army from France, and directly "train a new South Vietnamese army of 90,000 men." This U.S. approach is yet another open violation of the Geneva Conference agreement. The Geneva Conference agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam clearly stipulates: the introduction into Vietnam of any reinforcements of troops and military personnel, as well as all reinforcements of various types of weapons, ammunition, and other war materials, is prohibited. This provision of the Geneva Conference agreement is essential for maintaining the stability of the ceasefire in Vietnam. However, now that the U.S. aggressive bloc is disregarding everything and strengthening the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's army through direct "aid" and direct "training," this cannot but be a threat to the ceasefire in Vietnam.

    At the same time, the U.S. aggressive bloc is even more brazenly engaging in the old trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief'," spreading a large number of lies to smear the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for "violating" the Geneva Conference agreement. The fact that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam faithfully abides by the Geneva Conference agreement is obvious to all. The International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam has publicly announced that "the Commission is satisfied that there has been no violation of the Geneva Armistice Agreement in the delivery of large quantities of ammunition, weapons, or military equipment to the Viet Minh led by the Communists" (Associated Press). The International Supervisory and Control Commission has repeatedly refuted the rumors fabricated by U.S. and French news agencies, and criticized the French Union forces and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique for committing more and more serious violations of the armistice under the instigation and participation of U.S. interventionists. For example, as everyone already knows, the U.S. imperialists forced those so-called "refugees" who were forced or deceived into leaving North Vietnam to go to South Vietnam to join the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's army. It can be seen from this that the U.S. aggressive bloc's purpose in fabricating absurd lies to smear the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to cover up its own crimes of undermining the Geneva Conference agreement.

    The ambition of the United States to intensify its interference in the Vietnam situation is very easy to see through. U.S. Special Envoy to South Vietnam Collins said shamelessly: "You only need to look at the map to understand its [referring to Vietnam] tremendous strategic and economic importance in this part of the world." From this, people can know that the U.S. aggressors have not abandoned their ambition to establish a new colonial rule over the Indochinese countries. They want to support and strengthen the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's ruling position in South Vietnam and support Ngo Dinh Diem as another Syngman Rhee to realize their sinister plot. Therefore, as soon as Collins arrived in Saigon, he planned to seize control of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's army from France in order to directly "train" and "aid" the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's army. At the same time, he openly attacked the pro-French Nguyen Van Hinh military group and put pressure on the puppet Bao Dai, forcing Bao Dai to announce the dismissal of Nguyen Van Hinh. The U.S. aggressive bloc does this in the hope that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique can use terrorist rule to stifle the South Vietnamese people's desire for peace, democracy, unification, and independence, thereby creating conditions to obstruct the Vietnamese general election and hinder the unification of Vietnam.

    The U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" once revealed that the United States is prepared to disregard the agreements already reached at the Geneva Conference and insist that the Vietnamese general election be conducted under the auspices and supervision of the United Nations; in this way, "any plan to conduct a general election will be disrupted." Collins openly stated at a press conference in Saigon on November 17 that only when the South Vietnamese people are completely subdued under the cruel rule of the U.S. puppet Ngo Dinh Diem government will "the people vote in favor of freedom and against communism." He also blatantly said that the United States would interfere with and undermine the all-Vietnam free elections stipulated in the armistice agreement through "U.S. aid." He said: "I hope that U.S. aid will help persuade all Vietnamese to declare that they are in favor of establishing a national government and against communism." This clearly shows that the U.S. aggressive bloc is attempting to impose the reactionary rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique on the Vietnamese people in order to establish U.S. colonial rule over the Vietnamese people.

    It is obvious that the U.S. aggressors' shameless interference in South Vietnam is a serious violation of the Vietnamese people's will for peace, democracy, independence, and unification. They want to undermine the solution of the Vietnam political issue, that is, they want to fundamentally overturn the Geneva Conference agreement. Therefore, this cannot but seriously damage the peaceful atmosphere created by the Geneva Conference and hinder the consolidation of peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. The Vietnamese people and the people of the Indochinese countries, as well as all peace-loving people around the world, express strong opposition to this.

    It should be pointed out that the French ruling group must also bear some responsibility for the U.S. aggressive bloc's actions to undermine the Geneva Conference agreement. After the Geneva Conference, the French government not only followed the United States in signing the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," but also, during the U.S.-French talks held in Washington in September of this year, France agreed to have the United States directly "aid" and "train" the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's army in exchange for "U.S. aid." Recently, French Prime Minister Mendès France, during his visit to the United States, again made a deal with the United States to give the United States complete control over South Vietnam. The "U.S. News & World Report" magazine's correspondent in Paris revealed in a report: Due to a "directive" jointly signed by Mendès France and Dulles in Washington, "in terms of policy toward Indochina, the United States will take over the main responsibility from France." The report also said: "French officials believe that this directive means that Mendès France has now given up his responsibility for Indochina." People know that the most important responsibility that the French government bears for the Indochina situation is to ensure that the Geneva Conference agreement is fully implemented. The French government's subservience to the U.S. aggressive policy clearly violates its solemn responsibilities under the Geneva Conference agreement. In this way, it is bound to cause damage to French interests and hinder the establishment of good relations between Vietnam and France.

    The heinous acts of the U.S. aggressive bloc and their followers in wantonly undermining the Geneva Conference agreement cannot be tolerated. Peace-loving people of all countries must resolutely support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the people of the Indochinese countries for peace, democracy, independence, and unification, and stop the destructive conspiracies of the U.S. aggressive bloc, so that the solemn agreement of the Geneva Conference can be fully implemented.

    美国对南越局势的无耻干涉
    周修庆
    美国侵略集团对越南局势的干涉越来越露骨了。越南民主共和国胡志明主席在答复法国杂志“观察画报”记者的问题中，严正地斥责了美国侵略集团的无耻干涉行为。越南民主共和国外交部长范文同十二月五日关于美国柯林斯的使命的声明，越南人民军总司令部同日提出的关于在法兰西联邦部队集结区内所犯的违反停战协定的行为、特别是关于美国柯林斯的使命问题的备忘录，都以无可置辩的事实揭露了美国侵略集团破坏印度支那停战协定、加紧干涉越南的阴谋活动。全世界爱好和平的人民和各国公正舆论都应该密切注视这种事实。
    大家知道，日内瓦会议达成了在承认越南、老挝和柬埔寨三国人民的民族权利基础上结束印度支那敌对行动恢复和平的协议。全世界都欢迎这个协议。越南民主共和国认真地执行了日内瓦会议的协议。胡志明主席并一再申明，越南民主共和国同意中国总理和印度总理倡议的和平共处的五项原则，并且希望在越南同老挝和柬埔寨以及其他国家的关系中应用这五项原则。由于越南民主共和国的努力，越法双方已就法国在越南民主共和国境内的企业继续经营问题达成了协议。越南民主共和国的这些努力表现了越南人民贯彻日内瓦会议协议和维护自己民族的独立和主权的不可动摇的愿望，并且对于扩大东南亚地区的和平也是一个重要的贡献。
    然而，美国侵略集团却对日内瓦会议的协议公然采取了相反的态度。美国总统艾森豪威尔就曾毫不掩饰地表示美国“不喜欢”日内瓦会议协议，并说美国“不受这种决定的约束”。在日内瓦会议之后，美国便纠集英、法等国在马尼拉签订了所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”。这个由美国制造出来的条约竟然片面地宣布把南越、老挝和柬埔寨划进东南亚军事集团的“保护”范围之内。这显然是违反了日内瓦会议的协议关于印度支那国家不得参加任何军事集团的规定的。“巴基斯坦时报”在评论马尼拉条约时就曾指出，这个战争条约是“对日内瓦协定中关于印度支那国家不得同任何国家缔结军事同盟的重要规定的公开破坏”。显然，美国侵略集团的这种做法，是要阻挠日内瓦会议的协议的实施，破坏印度支那的和平，阴谋把印度支那国家变成它的殖民地和军事基地。
    为了进一步实现马尼拉条约的侵略目的，美国侵略集团最近更变本加厉地在南越进行干涉活动。为此，美国政府在不久之前派遣曾参与策划侵朝战争的美国前陆军参谋长柯林斯到西贡去任驻南越特使。据美英通讯社透露，柯林斯的使命就是要在军事上和政治上加强南越吴庭艳集团，干涉越南内政，阻挠越南的统一。
    事实也正是如此。就在柯林斯到达西贡的第四天，美国国务卿杜勒斯便承认柯林斯正在西贡“紧张地研究在军事方面可以进行的工作”。柯林斯在十一月十七日也直言不讳地说他到南越的特殊任务是“给吴庭艳政府以美国的无条件的支持”和“用一切可能的办法援助这个政府”。这些“援助”主要包括“由美国顾问团训练越南军队”，而这些军队的装备“将有百分之九十是美国的”。美国“纽约邮报”已公开透露，柯林斯正在研究如何处理已经运到南越的价值二十亿美元以上的一百九十万吨美国武器和弹药。美国通讯社更说，美国自明年
  一月一日起，将撇开法国，直接给印度支那国家以军事“援助”，其中给南越吴庭艳集团的“援助”就将达三亿美元。值得注意的是，美国在加紧“援助”吴庭艳集团的同时，还计划在明年一月一日开始从法国手中“接收”对吴庭艳集团的军队的训练权，直接“训练一支新的九万人的南越军队”。美国的这种做法是对日内瓦会议协议的又一公开破坏行为。日内瓦会议关于越南停止敌对行动协定明确规定：禁止向越南运入一切增援部队和军事辅助人员，以及一切增援的各种类型的武器、弹药和其他作战物资。日内瓦会议的协议的这项规定对于保持越南停战状态的稳定是十分必要的。但是，现在美国侵略集团既然不顾一切地要以直接“援助”和直接“训练”的方法，加强吴庭艳集团的军队，这就不能不是对越南停战状态的一种威胁。
    与此同时，美国侵略集团更玩弄“作贼喊贼”的老一套惯技，散播大量谎言，诬蔑越南民主共和国“违反”日内瓦会议的协议。越南民主共和国忠诚地遵守日内瓦会议协议的事实是人所共见的。越南国际监督和监察委员会曾公开宣布“委员会感到满意的是并没有发生违犯日内瓦停战协定运交共产党领导的越盟以大量弹药、武器或军事装备的事”（美联社），国际监督和监察委员会并一再驳斥美、法通讯社的造谣，指责法兰西联邦部队和吴庭艳集团在美国干涉者唆使和参预下犯了越来越多的严重违反停战的行为。例如大家所已知道的，美帝国主义者曾迫使那些被迫或被欺骗离开北越而到南越去的所谓“难民”加入吴庭艳集团军队。由此可知，美国侵略集团所以要制造诬蔑越南民主共和国的无稽谎言，其目的是在于掩饰他们自己破坏日内瓦会议协议的罪行。
    美国加紧干涉越南局势所怀抱的野心是十分容易识破的。美国驻南越特使柯林斯曾无耻地说：“你们只要看一下地图，就可以了解它（指越南）在世界这一部分中所具有的巨大的战略和经济重要性。”人们由此可以知道，美国侵略者要在印度支那各国建立美国的新的殖民统治的野心并没有放弃。他们想通过支持和加强吴庭艳集团在南越的统治地位，把吴庭艳扶植成为另一个李承晚，来实现他们的这种罪恶阴谋。因此，柯林斯一到西贡，便一面策划夺取法国对吴庭艳集团军队的控制权，以便直接“训练”和“援助”吴庭艳集团的军队，一面公开打击亲法的阮文馨军事集团，并对保大傀儡施加压力，迫使保大宣布将阮文馨免职。美国侵略集团之所以这样做，是指望吴庭艳集团能用恐怖统治来扼杀南越人民要求和平、民主、统一和独立的愿望，从而制造阻挠越南普选和妨碍越南统一的条件。
    美国“基督教科学箴言报”就曾透露，美国准备不顾日内瓦会议已取得的协议，坚持越南的普选要在联合国的主持和监督下进行；这样，就可以使
  “任何进行普选的计划都将被打破”。柯林斯在十一月十七日的西贡记者招待会上更公开表示只有使南越人民完全屈服在美国傀儡吴庭艳政府的残酷统治之下，“人民才会投票赞成自由，反对共产主义”。他并明目张胆地说美国要通过“美援”来干涉并破坏停战协定所规定的全越自由选举。他说：“我希望美援将有助于说服所有的越南人宣称他们赞成成立一个民族的政府，反对共产主义。”这就十分清楚地说明了，美国侵略集团是妄图把吴庭艳集团的反动统治强加于越南人民身上，以便建立美国对越南人民的殖民统治。
    显而易见，美国侵略者对南越的无耻干涉是对越南人民要求和平、民主、独立、统一的意志的严重侵犯。他们要破坏越南政治问题的解决，也就是想要从根本上推翻日内瓦会议协议。因而，这不能不严重地损害了日内瓦会议所产生的有利于和平的气氛，并阻碍了印度支那和东南亚的和平的巩固。越南人民和印度支那各国人民，以及全世界爱好和平的人民对此都表示强烈的反对。
    应当指出，对于美国侵略集团破坏日内瓦会议协议的行为，法国统治集团也要负一定的责任。法国政府在日内瓦会议之后不但追随美国签订了所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”，并且在今年九月间在华盛顿举行的美法会谈中，法国答应由美国直接“援助”和“训练”吴庭艳集团的军队，来换取“美援”。最近，法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯在访问美国期间，又和美国做成了使美国完全控制南越的交易。“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志驻巴黎的记者在
  一篇报道中透露说：由于孟戴斯—弗朗斯和杜勒斯在华盛顿联合签署的一项“训令”，“在对印度支那的政策方面，美国将从法国手里把主要责任接过去。”这篇报道并说：“法国官员们认为这项训令意味着孟戴斯—弗朗斯现在已经放弃了他对印度支那的责任”。人们知道，法国政府对印度支那局势所负担的最主要的责任就是保证日内瓦会议的协议得到完全的实施。法国政府对美国侵略政策的屈从，显然是违背了它对日内瓦会议的协议所承担的庄严职责的。这样，就必然对法国利益也要造成损害，并妨碍越南和法国之间的良好关系的建立。
    美国侵略集团和他们的追随者肆意破坏日内瓦会议协议的罪恶行为是不能被容许的。各国爱好和平的人民一定要坚决支持越南人民和印度支那各国人民争取和平、民主、独立和统一的斗争，制止美国侵略集团的破坏阴谋，以使日内瓦会议的庄严协议得到完全的实施。
