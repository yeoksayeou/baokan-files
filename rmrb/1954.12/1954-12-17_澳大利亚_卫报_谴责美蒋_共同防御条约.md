    Australian "Guardian"
    Condemns U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty"
    And Denounces U.S. Denial of Espionage Crimes
    [Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, 16th] Melbourne dispatch: The Australian weekly "Guardian" published an editorial in its December 9th issue condemning the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The editorial stated, "After disregarding all opposition and deciding to re-militarize West Germany, the U.S. government has now signed a treaty officially placing Chiang Kai-shek under U.S. protection." The editorial said that these two steps fully mean that the rulers of the capitalist world are attempting to launch wars in Europe and Asia.
    The editorial stated: The Chinese People's Government has decided to liberate Taiwan and return Taiwan to China. Taiwan is part of China, and no other country has the right to interfere, just as no foreign country can separate Tasmania from Australia. The editorial stated that no other country has the right to protect the Chiang Kai-shek clique to resist the Chinese people, attempt to restore the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and build Taiwan into a war base for invading the mainland. The editorial said, "However, these are precisely the things that the U.S. plutocratic government is doing."
      [Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, 16th] Melbourne dispatch: The Australian weekly "Guardian" published a commentary in its December 9th issue, denouncing the United States for denying its crime of sending spies to China to carry out sabotage activities. The commentary stated, "The United States claims that these people were carrying out their mission in Korea. But in fact, the plane they were on was shot down while flying entirely within Chinese territory." The commentary said, "The U.S. government boasts that it has spies in China. But when they are caught, it fabricates a different story."

    澳大利亚“卫报”
    谴责美蒋“共同防御条约”
    并斥美国抵赖间谍活动罪行
    【新华社十六日讯】墨尔本消息：澳大利亚周刊“卫报”在十二月九日出版的一期中发表社论，谴责美蒋“共同防御条约”。社论说，“美国政府在不顾一切反对，决定使西德重新军国主义化以后，现在又签订了一个把蒋介石正式放在美国的庇护之下的条约。”社论说，这两个步骤完全意味着资本主义世界的统治者们企图在欧洲和亚洲发动战争。
    社论说：中国人民政府已经决定要解放台湾，把台湾重新归入中国。台湾是中国的一部分，任何别的国家都无权进行干涉，正如任何外国不能把塔斯马尼亚岛和澳大利亚分割开来一样。社论说，任何别的国家也没有权利庇护蒋介石集团来抵制中国人民，试图使蒋介石集团复辟，并且把台湾建筑成为侵犯大陆的战争基地。社论说，“然而，这些正是美国富豪政府正在干的事情。”
      【新华社十六日讯】墨尔本消息：澳大利亚周刊“卫报”在十二月九日出版的一期中发表评论，斥责美国抵赖它派遣间谍到中国去进行破坏活动的罪行。评论说，“美国声称，这些人是在朝鲜执行他们的任务的。但是，事实上，他们所乘的飞机根本是在中国境内飞行时被击落的。”评论说，“美国政府夸耀说，它在中国派有间谍。但是当他们被抓住的时候，它却杜撰了一种不同的说法。”
