Today is the thirty-seventh anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Republic of Finland. The fact that Premier Zhou and all guests have honored us with their presence is a great honor for this embassy. I would like to welcome and thank the Premier and all of you.

Today I am very happy to say that since December 6th of last year, the relations between Finland and China have undergone new and significant developments. I must mention that in my desire to develop friendly relations between our two countries, I have received deep concern and support from the Government of the People's Republic of China. The visit of Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade of China, to Finland has made a great contribution to the development of this friendly relationship and is valued by our country. We also welcome the arrival of China's first ambassador to Finland. This is an equally important symbol of the increasing friendship between our two countries.

Now, let us toast to Finnish-Chinese friendship, to the great Chinese people and their leader Chairman Mao Zedong.

    孙士敦公使的讲话
    今天是芬兰共和国宣布独立的三十七周年纪念，承蒙总理先生和诸位来宾光临，本使馆深为荣幸。敬向总理先生和诸位表示欢迎和谢意。
    今天我能够很高兴地说，从去年十二月六日到现在，芬中两国间的关系有了新的、显著的发展。我必须提到：在我为发展我们两国间友好关系的愿望中，我从中华人民共和国政府方面得到深切的关注和支持。中国对外贸易部雷任民副部长的访问芬兰，对于发展这个友好关系有很大的贡献，而且为我国所珍视。我们也欢迎中国的首任大使到达芬兰。这对我们两国间日益增进的友谊，也是一个同等重要的标志。
    现在，我们为芬中友谊、为伟大的中国人民和他们的领袖毛泽东主席干杯。
