Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: The US and British rulers, who are plotting to rearm West Germany, are in a frantic state after the French National Assembly rejected the Western war bloc's plan to rearm West Germany twice in less than four months, demonstrating the immense power of the French people.

"The National Assembly rejected the Western European Union plan earlier today by a surprising vote, throwing the entire Western alliance into disarray. … The representatives elected by the French people have clearly demonstrated twice in the past four months that they will never voluntarily approve the rearmament of a country that has invaded France three times in the past seventy years." This is how United Press International summarized it.

Reporting on Washington's reaction to the French National Assembly's rejection of the Paris Accords regarding the rearmament of West Germany within the "Western European Union" by a vote of 280 to 259, United Press International said that this action "shocked American officials." UPI also said: "The State Department had assumed that French ratification of the European Defense Plan would not be a problem." Reuters described London's reaction with the words "deeply shocked." Associated Press reported: "The vote alarmed Britain."

According to Washington sources, after learning of the French National Assembly's rejection of the rearmament of West Germany on the 24th, US Secretary of State Dulles immediately telephoned President Eisenhower, who was taking a Christmas vacation in Augusta, for more than thirty minutes. He then held a one-hour meeting with the British Ambassador to the United States, Makins. After the meeting, Dulles telephoned Eisenhower again for more than twenty minutes. According to a State Department spokesman, Dulles decided to spend the entire day on the 24th studying the situation in France.

In London, British Foreign Secretary Eden, who was scheduled to leave London on the 24th for Christmas, rushed back to the Foreign Office, held six hours of emergency consultations, and consulted with Washington via transatlantic telephone.

Various forms of intimidation and threats then emanated from London, Washington, and Augusta.

White House Press Secretary Hagerty announced at a press conference that President Eisenhower considered the French National Assembly's rejection to be an "extremely serious matter" and that he could not regard it as a "final decision." State Department spokesman Lincoln White also announced that Secretary of State Dulles and the President were both "extremely concerned about the situation in Paris." At the same time, the State Department revealed through news agencies that Dulles believed the French National Assembly's vote raised the question of whether France "has the ability to make decisions that a great power should have." More blatant and naked pressure came from London. The British Foreign Office issued a statement threatening that "the unity of the Western allies is at stake" and again pressured members of the French National Assembly to agree to revive German militarism by threatening to withdraw the so-called "guarantee" of British troops stationed on the European continent and to rearm West Germany regardless of France. Dulles expressed "gratitude" for the "equally tough stance" taken by the British government and the "straightforward" statement on the need to rearm West Germany.

The joint exertion of such crude pressure by the US and British governments on the French National Assembly is betting on the votes on a series of motions of confidence in Mendes-France in the French National Assembly next week. They hope that this strong pressure will force some wavering and hesitant members of the National Assembly to finally disregard the will of the people and betray the interests of their nation by voting in favor of the Paris Accords on the rearmament of West Germany.

    策划重新武装西德的美英统治者手忙脚乱
    他们正对法国议会施加压力和无耻的恫吓
    【新华社二十五日讯】法国国民议会在不到四个月的时间中两次否决掉西方战争集团重新武装西德的计划，表现了法国人民的巨大力量，而使策划重新武装西德的美国和英国的统治者手忙脚乱。
    “国民议会今天早些时候以令人惊讶的表决结果拒绝了西欧联盟计划，这样使整个西方同盟陷于混乱。……法国人民选出的代表在以往四个月中两次清楚地证明，他们决不会自愿批准在过去七十年中三次入侵法国的那个国家重新武装。”这是合众社的概括。
    合众社报道华盛顿对于法国国民议会以二百八十票对二百五十九票拒绝批准巴黎协定关于在“西欧联盟”范围内重新武装西德的议定书的反应时说，法国这一行动“使美国官员为之震惊”。合众社并说：“国务院曾以为，法国批准欧洲防御计划是不会成问题的。”路透社以“深感震惊”几个字来形容伦敦的反应。美联社报道说：“这次表决使英国惊惶失措。”
    据华盛顿消息，美国国务卿杜勒斯在二十四日知道法国国民议会拒绝武装西德的消息后，立刻打电话给正在奥古斯大度圣诞假期的总统艾森豪威尔商谈了三十分钟以上，接着又同英国驻美国大使麦金斯举行了历时一小时的会谈。会谈后，杜勒斯又同艾森豪威尔通了二十多分钟的电话。据国务院发言人说，杜勒斯二十四日决定用整天时间来研究法国的局势。
    在伦敦，预定要在二十四日离开伦敦去度圣诞节的英国外交大臣艾登匆忙赶回外交部，举行了六小时的紧急商议，并且通过横贯大西洋的电话和华盛顿磋商。
    从伦敦、华盛顿和奥古斯大接着就发出了各式各样的恫吓和威胁。
    白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂在记者招待会上宣布：艾森豪威尔总统认为法国国民议会的否决是一件“极其严重的事情”，他不能认为这是“最后决定”。国务院发言人林肯·怀特也宣布说国务卿杜勒斯和总统都“极为关注巴黎的局势”。同时，国务院通过通讯社透露说，杜勒斯认为法国国民议会的表决提出了法国“是否具有一个大国所应有的作出决定的能力”的问题。更粗暴赤裸的压力发自伦敦。英国外交部发表声明，威胁说“西方盟国的团结在此一举”声明再次以取消所谓英国在欧洲大陆驻军的“保证”和不顾法国而径自重新武装西德的威胁压迫法国国民议会议员同意复活德国军国主义。杜勒斯对英国政府所采取的“同样强硬的立场”和发表关于必须重新武装西德的“直截了当”的声明表示
  “感激”。
    美、英两国政府对法国国民议会共同行施这样粗暴的压力，是把赌注押在下周法国国民议会对孟戴斯—弗朗斯提出的一系列信任案的表决上。它们希望靠着这种强大的压力会迫使国民议会中一些动摇犹豫的议员终于不顾人民意志、背叛他们民族的利益而投票支持重新武装西德的巴黎协定。
