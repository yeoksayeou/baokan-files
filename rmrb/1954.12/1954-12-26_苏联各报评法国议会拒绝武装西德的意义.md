Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 25th: Moscow newspapers published articles on December 25th commenting on the French National Assembly's debate on the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

    "Pravda" published a lengthy dispatch from its Paris correspondent, Lasakin. The correspondent wrote: The French Parliament has voted against the revival of German militarism, against the establishment of a "Western European Union," and against pulling West Germany into this union.

    Lasakin pointed out: Mendès France immediately exerted new pressure on the parliament, raising the issue of confidence on the remaining articles of the bill and amendments proposed by others. Now, the reactionaries are mobilizing all their forces, attempting to force the deputies who voted against the rearmament of West Germany to surrender, forcing them to vote in favor of ratifying the Paris Agreements.

    Whether deputies or journalists, after listening to the French Prime Minister's speech, believed that Washington was doing everything possible to salvage the Paris Agreements from failure with beautiful, empty promises and statements.

    "Pravda" published an article by Ladzhiani, titled "The Struggle Continues." The author said: The French people are now very clear that as long as France resolutely says "no," American monopoly capital will not dare to openly embark on arming West German militarists. The French people are also very clear that their struggle against establishing a hotbed of war in the center of Europe is not isolated. All peace-loving people in Europe are with them, and they have many allies and friends who understand France's legitimate interests.

    Ladzhiani pointed out: A situation has now formed in France where, to make France accept the Paris Agreements, it would require external pressure from the American aggressive bloc, disregarding the will of the French people.

      "Izvestia," analyzing the failure of the Paris Agreements, wrote: "There is no doubt that the nationwide movement against the Paris Agreements, which has unfolded throughout France in recent days, has influenced certain bourgeois deputies. These deputies cannot but consider the attitude of their voters."

    "Izvestia" pointed out: Washington and London are exerting significant pressure on the members of the French National Assembly. American and British newspapers hint that Washington and London officials want Mendès France to use any means necessary to get the French Parliament to ratify the Paris Agreements.

    "Izvestia" said: Succumbing to such intimidation is tantamount to opposing French interests and the unanimous will of the French people. The French people want the deputies to refuse to ratify the Paris Agreements, to refuse to follow the policy of arming German militarism that leads France to suicide.

    "Labor News" published an article signed "Reporter," titled: "The Will of the People of All Countries is the Decisive Factor." The article said: The situation in France is sufficient to represent the situation in other European countries. The people of all countries demand the rejection of the Paris Agreements. In recent years, the people of all countries have more than once shattered the aggressors' conspiracies against peace and against the implementation of genuine international cooperation. They will certainly do everything possible to prevent the revival of the "Bundeswehr" and the threat of a new war, to ensure the victory of the proposition of collective security in Europe, and to ensure the victory of the cause of peace throughout the world.

    Dajiangzi published an article in "Red Star" entitled "What Does the French Parliament's Vote Indicate?" The article said: The vote in the National Assembly shows that the majority of French deputies have voiced reason, and have not heeded the fabricated arguments of the discredited defenders of the German "Bundeswehr." The article pointed out that this vote has caused panic among the aggressive bloc, and the French government is now doing everything possible to suppress the will of the National Assembly. The vote to be held on the 27th will determine the fate of the Paris Agreements, which the French people resolutely oppose. The National Assembly will have to show whether it intends to follow the will of the French people, or is prepared to embark on a path that violates French national interests.

    苏联各报评法国议会拒绝武装西德的意义
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科各报二十五日发表文章，评论法国国民议会关于批准巴黎协定的辩论。
    “真理报”刊载了它驻巴黎的记者拉萨金的一篇长篇通讯。记者写道：法国议会已经表决反对复活德国军国主义，反对建立“西欧联盟”和把西德拉到这个联盟里面来。
    拉萨金指出：孟戴斯—弗朗斯对议会立刻施行新的压力，就法案的其余各条和别人提出的修正案提出了信任问题。现在，反动派动员了一切力量，企图迫使投票反对西德重新武装的议员投降，迫使他们投票赞成批准巴黎协定。
    无论是议员或是记者在听了法国总理的发言之后，都认为华盛顿正在竭尽一切力量，企图以漂亮的空洞诺言和声明从失败中挽救巴黎协定。
    “真理报”发表了拉季阿尼的一篇文章，题目是“斗争在继续中”。作者说：法国人现在都很清楚地知道，只要法国坚决地说一声“不成”，美国垄断资本就不敢公然着手武装西德军国主义者。法国人民也很清楚地知道，他们反对在欧洲中心建立战争温床的斗争并不是孤立的。全欧洲一切爱好和平的人民和他们在一起，他们有许多了解法国合法利益的盟友和朋友。
    拉季阿尼指出：法国现在形成了这样一种局势：要使法国接受巴黎协定，那除非是由于美国侵略集团方面的外来的压力，除非是不顾法国人民的意志。
      “消息报”分析巴黎协定的失败时写道：“没有疑问，近日在全法国展开的反对巴黎协定的全民运动，对于某些资产阶级的议员是发生了影响的。这些议员不能不考虑他们的选民的态度。
    “消息报”指出：华盛顿和伦敦在对法国国民议会议员施行重大压力。美国和英国的报纸暗示说，华盛顿和伦敦官方人士要孟戴斯—弗朗斯不惜任何手段使法国议会批准巴黎协定。
    “消息报”说：屈服于这种恫吓就等于反对法国利益，反对法国人民一致的意志。法国人民要议员拒绝批准巴黎协定，拒绝使法国走向自杀的武装德国军国主义的政策。
    “劳动报”发表了署名“记者”的一篇文章，题目是：“各国人民的意旨才是决定性的因素”。文章说：法国的局势足以代表欧洲其他国家的局势。各国人民要求拒绝巴黎协定。最近几年，各国人民已不止一次地粉碎了侵略者反对和平、反对实行真诚的国际合作的阴谋。他们一定会尽一切力量来防止“国防军”复活和发生新战争的威胁，保证欧洲集体安全的主张的胜利，保证和平事业在全世界获得胜利。
    达江兹在“红星报”上发表了一篇以“法国议会的表决说明了什么”为题的文章。文章说：国民议会的表决表明大多数法国议员发出了理智的声音，而没有理睬那些德国“国防军”的声名狼藉的辩护人虚构的说法。文章指出，这次表决引起了侵略集团的慌乱，法国政府现在尽一切力量来压制国民议会的意志。二十七日举行的投票将决定法国人民所坚决反对的巴黎协定的命运。国民议会将要表明，它打算奉行法国人民的意志，还是准备走上违反法国民族利益的道路。
