The Chinese Red Cross Delegation's Visit to Japan

Li Dequan, Head of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation

At the invitation of Mr. Tadatsugu Shimazu, President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Chinese Red Cross Delegation, led by Head Li Dequan and Deputy Head Liao Chengzhi, a group of ten people, departed from Beijing on October 24th, arrived in Tokyo on October 30th, and left Japan on November 12th, paying a friendly visit to Japan for twelve days.

The visit of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation to Japan was proposed by President Tadatsugu Shimazu, as a gesture of gratitude from the Japanese side for the assistance of the Chinese Red Cross in the repatriation of Japanese nationals, during the visit of the Japanese Red Cross Society and two other organizations to China in February 1953 to discuss the repatriation of Japanese nationals. The Chinese Red Cross immediately expressed its willingness to visit Japan to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. On August 4, 1954, the Chinese Red Cross received a formal invitation from the Japanese Red Cross Society. From the proposal of this matter to the official trip of the delegation, twenty months have passed, and there have been many twists and turns in the middle, but with the continuous efforts of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Peace Liaison Council, the Japanese people, and friends from all walks of life in Japan, this friendly visit was finally realized.

The Chinese Red Cross Delegation was the first non-governmental envoy of New China to visit Japan. It was the first delegation from New China to make a friendly visit to Japan after the war, which is a new development in Sino-Japanese exchanges in recent years. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, representatives from Japan's peace, culture, trade, labor, agriculture, youth and other fields have successively visited China; by the summer of 1954, the Chinese Red Cross, in the spirit of humanitarianism, had assisted 26,700 Japanese nationals in returning to their homeland; at the same time, Japanese peace, friendship and religious groups also collected the remains of Chinese anti-Japanese martyrs and sent more than 1,000 of them back to China. Especially after the Geneva Conference, such exchanges have increased rapidly. During our National Day this year alone, about 110 Japanese delegations, including members of parliament, culture, women, and trade unions, visited China. These exchanges have increased the friendship and understanding between the Chinese and Japanese people. The visit of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation to Japan was to convey the Chinese people's desire and determination to live in long-term friendship and peaceful coexistence with the Japanese people, so as to further advance the friendship and understanding between the two peoples, and to take this opportunity to consult with the Japanese Red Cross Society and other three organizations on matters related to assisting the repatriation of Japanese nationals and to bring the list of Japanese war criminals in China to Japan. After arriving in Japan, the delegation participated in a total of nineteen national welcome rallies and various forums of people from all walks of life, various groups, and local representatives, seventeen banquets and tea parties, and held thirteen press conferences, broadcasts, and television broadcasts. To the broad social strata of Japan, it sincerely and in detail expressed the propositions and wishes of China and the Chinese people regarding Sino-Japanese friendship. The delegation made it clear that the Chinese people recognize how important strengthening the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people is to Asian peace, and emphasized that in order to guarantee Asian and world peace, the responsibilities of the Chinese and Japanese people are very important. China and the Chinese people are willing to apply the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence to relations with all countries in the world, and of course, they also apply to relations with Japan. This is China's national policy and a concrete manifestation of the People's Republic of China's peaceful foreign policy. The delegation emphasized that Sino-Japanese trade has a bright future, and that cultural exchanges will deepen mutual understanding between China and Japan, so as to further improve Sino-Japanese relations and strive to establish normal relations with Japan. At the same time, the delegation repeatedly stated on all occasions that the Chinese people do not bear old grudges against the Japanese people, and that the sixty years of war history between China and Japan have passed. The responsibility of the Chinese and Japanese people is to ensure that this past is not repeated, and efforts should be made to restore and develop the two thousand years of friendly exchanges between China and Japan. When conveying the Chinese people's concern for the Japanese people, the delegation pointed out that the Chinese people are very sympathetic to the environment in which the Japanese people find themselves today, and firmly believe that the industrious, brave, intelligent, and independent Japanese nation, which has been independent for thousands of years, will surely become an independent, peaceful, free, and democratic country. The delegation also emphasized that there are difficulties in realizing Sino-Japanese friendship. There is an external force that hopes that China and Japan will be at odds and hostile to each other, so that they can profit from it. This is a dangerous conspiracy, and we should never underestimate this danger. However, the Chinese people are determined and confident to overcome all difficulties for the sake of Sino-Japanese friendship, and believe that the Japanese people must also have the same feeling. These words aroused good reactions and enthusiastic resonance among the Japanese people and the broad social strata of Japan.

The Chinese Red Cross Delegation received a warm welcome from the Japanese people and all walks of life in Japan. Just participating in the Eastern Japan National Welcome Rally, the Western Japan National Welcome Rally, the Kyoto National Welcome Rally, the "Japan-China Peace Forum," and the Women's Forum, etc., there were as many as 70,000 to 80,000 people. The governors and assembly speakers of Tokyo Metropolis, Osaka Prefecture, Kyoto Prefecture, and Aichi Prefecture, as well as the mayors and city council speakers of Kyoto, Osaka, Yokohama, Maizuru, Fuse, Kobe, Yao, Ikeda, Fujisawa, Itami, and Sakai, all came forward to warmly welcome our delegation. Wherever the delegation visited or toured, welcome flags fluttered everywhere, and applause and cheers could be heard everywhere. In Tokyo, the welcoming crowds in front of the hotel where the delegation stayed never stopped; in Nagoya, the welcoming songs were loud all night; when the delegation arrived in Kyoto, there were more than 30,000 people welcoming them at Kyoto Station. Japanese friends said: Today's joy is more lively than any festival; in Osaka, thousands of people lined the streets to welcome them. When the delegation took the train from Tokyo to Nagoya, there were welcome lines with Chinese flags, Japanese flags, and Red Cross flags at the stops and in the fields along the way; when the delegation took the car from Kyoto to Osaka, the welcoming crowds were endless on the 60-kilometer-long "Keihan Highway." Not only that, but many mass organizations held welcome meetings in Kyushu, China, and Hokkaido, and read out the thank-you speeches sent by the delegation; at the same time, telegrams of congratulations were sent to the delegation from all over the country to express their welcome. All of this made people strongly feel that the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people has a good foundation.

The delegation also received a warm welcome from overseas Chinese and Korean residents in Japan.

During the visit to Japan, the delegation visited major cities such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, and Kobe, visited the facilities of the Japanese Red Cross Society, Japanese pottery factories, silk weaving factories, television equipment, and visited the performances of Japanese Kabuki and "Bunraku" (puppet shows), as well as Japanese cultural monuments, and widely contacted various groups and social strata in Japan.

The delegation personally heard the voices of all sectors in Japan yearning for Sino-Japanese friendship, demanding strengthened exchanges, and the restoration of normal Sino-Japanese relations. Japanese public leader Ikuo Oyama said: Japan must unite with the people of Asian countries, especially with the people of New China. In this regard, many encouraging things have happened recently, especially the joint statement issued by Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru and the joint declaration announced by the Chinese and Soviet governments, which have had a profound impact on the Japanese people. Speaker of the Japanese House of Councillors Yahachi Kawai said: From Japan's standpoint, it is necessary to establish peaceful relations between China and Japan as soon as possible, deepen the friendship between the people, and develop cultural and trade exchanges, so that Japan can achieve peace and prosperity. The visit of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation to Japan provided a good opportunity for friendly exchanges between China and Japan. Governor of Osaka Prefecture Fumizo Akama said: China's peaceful and friendly policy excites us. Governor of Kyoto Prefecture Torazo Ninagawa said that the Japanese people are willing to work with the Chinese people to promote Japan-China friendship and strengthen economic exchanges. Vice Chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations Kogoro Uemura said: Although the economic relations between Japan and China are currently in an unnatural state, I believe that this state should not continue for long, and in the near future, it will become normal due to the efforts of most people. I believe that Mr. Li's visit to Japan this time will deepen the mutual understanding between Japan and China, promote friendship between Japan and China, and promote economic exchanges. Vice Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association Masao Tajima said at a welcome banquet of 180 people from the economic circles in the Kansai region: We believe that with the progress of China's construction, China and Japan can mutually promote economic exchanges. We are very eager to develop economic exchanges between China and Japan. Recently, among countries around the world, regardless of political organization and social system, the voices that believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and demand the promotion of East-West trade are surging. Under such circumstances, Japan also believes that it is necessary to promote trade relations between China and Japan in any case, which has become a consensus among the vast majority of economic circles. President of Tokyo Hosei University Hyooe Ouchi and President of Tokyo Gakushuin University Yoshishige Abe emphasized the importance of the early restoration of normal relations between China and Japan for peace in the East and the world. President of Kyoto Ritsumeikan University Hiroshi Suekawa said: The Japanese people, like the Chinese people, sincerely hope for peace and friendship. Therefore, we must never allow a policy of Asians fighting Asians. President of Osaka University Arao Imamura said: After the war, the Japanese people are in an extremely complex and difficult internal and external environment, and most people have close feelings towards China. We believe that the people of China and Japan can shake hands and coexist even if there are differences in political doctrines, which is beyond doubt. In this sense, we hope that the visit of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation to Japan can become the beginning of friendly cooperation between China and Japan. In the Japanese public opinion circles, the president of "Chubu Nippon Shimbun" Yoshira said: The visit of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation to Japan has had a great impact on Japan; it has given the citizens of Nagoya great emotion, all of which will deepen the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Japan. The National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations, which was recently established by Japanese social celebrities, wrote in a resolution of thanks to the delegation: We deeply understand the firm and unwavering peaceful policy of China and the Soviet Union towards Japan. We firmly swear: We must strengthen the unity of the people across Japan, muster a hundred times the courage, and strive to fully restore diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union to respond to the Chinese Red Cross Delegation's friendly visit to Japan. President of the All-Japan Women's Organizations Federation Raicho Hiratsuka said: Japan can invite the peaceful envoys of New China for the first time, which is the favorite thing for peace-loving Japanese women, because this can strengthen the understanding and friendship between China and Japan and promote peace in Asia and the world. She also said: The joint declaration of the Chinese and Soviet governments on relations with Japan gave Japanese women great hope. Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan Tojiro Fujita said: The Japanese people earnestly hope that the visit of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation can become the starting point for future Sino-Japanese friendship. In addition, representatives from Japan's farmers, fisheries, religious, medical and other groups all expressed their eagerness for Sino-Japanese friendship from various perspectives.

Through this visit, the Chinese Red Cross Delegation clearly and sincerely conveyed the Chinese people's willingness and determination to live in long-term friendship and peaceful coexistence with the Japanese people to the Japanese people and the broad social strata of Japan. We also received a warm welcome from the Japanese people and the broad social strata of Japan, and personally saw that they have the same eagerness for peace and friendship as the Chinese people. This deepened the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, and at the same time expanded the scope of contact and exchanges between the Chinese people and all aspects of Japan, allowing more Japanese friends to understand China's peaceful policy and the Chinese people's strong will to defend Asian and world peace, thereby advancing the understanding between the people of China and Japan. Not only that, through this visit, the people of China and Japan encouraged each other to enhance the friendly relations between the two countries, and increased the courage and confidence to defend peace. The people of China and Japan are convinced that as long as the people of the two countries work together, the problems between China and Japan can be solved, and normal relations between China and Japan can be established; as long as the people of the two countries unite with each other, China and Japan can coexist peacefully, and any external resistance cannot destroy China-Japan friendship and peaceful coexistence; at the same time, as long as the people of the two countries strengthen friendship, the foundation of peace in Asia will be increasingly consolidated. All of this is a powerful setback to the American warmongers who have been preventing Sino-Japanese friendship, and also a heavy blow to Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous group, the running dogs of the United States.

Through this visit, we feel deeply that the demand for strengthening cultural exchanges and economic exchanges between China and Japan is indeed a common wish of the people of China and Japan, and it is also a practical need at present. Japan's economic circles, cultural circles, and the entire public opinion are demanding the strengthening of Sino-Japanese exchanges, especially the development of trade relations. Japanese friends are eagerly hoping that the visit of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation to Japan can become a good start for strengthening exchanges between the two countries in the future. When the delegation's visit entered its final stage, we had already heard that relevant parties in Japan were beginning to prepare to invite a Chinese trade delegation to visit Japan. At the same time, when talking with various sectors in Japan, the delegation repeatedly expressed its welcome to various groups or representatives from Japan to have the opportunity to continue to visit China. All of this shows that the visit of the Chinese Red Cross Delegation to Japan has created more possibilities and opened up a wider path for the people of the two countries to strengthen exchanges in the future.

During this visit, we also deeply realized that all sectors of Japanese society are demanding peace and earnestly hoping that Japan and China will have good relations. The vast majority of people revealed that they are unwilling to be under the semi-occupation of the United States. For the sake of peace and friendship with China, people from all walks of life in Japan are showing a trend of broad unity, and this trend of unity is gradually expanding. This trend will be a powerful factor in preventing the revival of Japanese militarism and the United States from using Japanese militarism to disrupt Asian and world peace.

    中国红十字会代表团访问日本报告
    中国红十字会访日代表团团长　李德全
    中国红十字会代表团应日本红十字会会长岛津忠承的邀请，在团长李德全、副团长廖承志率领下一行十人，十月二十四日由北京出发，十月三十日到达东京，十一月十二日离开日本，在日本作了十二天的友好访问。
    这次中国红十字会代表团访问日本，是在一九五三年二月日本红十字会等三团体代表团来中国商洽日侨归国问题时，由岛津忠承会长作为日本方面感谢中国红十字会对日侨归国的协助而提出的。中国红十字会为了加强中日人民的友谊，当时立即表示愿去日本访问。一九五四年八月四日，中国红十字会接到日本红十字会的正式邀请。从这一问题的提出直到代表团的访日正式成行，经过了二十个月，中间也存在着不少曲折，但在日本红十字会、日中友好协会、日本和平联络会和日本人民、日本各方面朋友的不断努力下，终于使这次友好的访问得以实现。
    中国红十字会代表团是作为新中国的第一个民间使节访问日本的。它是战后去日本作友好访问的新中国的第一个代表团，这是几年来中日往来的一个新发展。自从中华人民共和国建国以来，日本的和平、文化、贸易、工人、农民、青年等各方面的代表接连地到中国访问；到一九五四年夏季为止，中国红十字会本着人道主义精神曾协助二万六、七千名日侨回到他们的祖国；同时日本的和平、友好和宗教团体也把中国抗日烈士殉难者的遗骨收殓起来并且已把其中的一千多具送回了中国。特别是在日内瓦会议以后，这种往来迅速增加，仅在今年我国国庆节时，就有日本的议员、文化、妇女、工会等代表团约一百十数人来中国访问。这些往来都使中日人民的友谊和了解有所增进。这次中国红十字会代表团的访问日本，就是为了把中国人民要和日本人民长期友好和平共处的意愿和决心转告给日本人民，以便把两国人民的友谊和了解向前推进一步，并且利用这次机会与日本红十字会等三团体商洽有关协助日侨归国问题和把在中国的日本战犯名单带给日本。代表团到达日本后，共参加了十九次各界、各团体和各地方代表的国民欢迎大会和各种座谈会、十七次宴会和茶会，并举行了十三次记者招待会、播音和电视广播，对日本的广泛社会阶层诚恳地、详细地谈出了中国和中国人民关于中日友好的主张和愿望。代表团明确地说：中国人民认识到加强中日两国人民的友好关系对亚洲和平是如何重要，并强调指出：为了保证亚洲与世界和平，中日两国人民的责任十分重大。中国和中国人民愿意把互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则适用于和世界各国的关系上，当然也同样适用于对日本的关系上。这是中国的国策，也是中华人民共和国和平外交政策的具体表现。代表团着重地说：中日贸易是会有光明前途的，同时，通过文化交流，将使中日之间加深互相了解，以至进一步改善中日关系并争取与日本建立正常关系。同时，代表团在一切场合中，反复说明中国人民对日本人民不念旧恶，说明中日间六十年的战争历史已成过去，中日两国人民的责任就是使这种过去不要再重复，并应该努力使中日两国两千年的友好往来恢复与发展起来。代表团在转达了中国人民对日本人民的关怀时指出：中国人民非常同情日本人民今天所处的环境，并坚信勤劳、勇敢、智慧而且几千年来一直是独立的日本民族，一定能够成为一个独立、和平、自由、民主的国家。代表团还强调指出：在实现中日友好的道路上，并不是没有困难的。有一种外来的阻力，他们希望中日之间不和，并且相互敌视，以便他们从中取利，这是一种危险的阴谋，我们绝不应过低估计这种危险性。但是，中国人民是有为了中日友好来克服一切困难的决心和信心的，并且相信日本人民也一定具有同感。这一番话，在日本人民和日本广泛的社会阶层中引起了良好的反应和热烈的共鸣。
    中国红十字会代表团受到日本人民和日本各方面的热烈欢迎。只是参加东部日本国民欢迎大会、西部日本国民欢迎大会、京都国民欢迎大会以及“日中和平座谈会”、妇女座谈会等人数就有七、八万人。东京都、大阪府、京都府和爱知县等知事和议会议长以及京都、大阪、横滨、舞鹤、布施、神户、八尾、池田、藤泽、伊丹和堺等市市长及市议会议长等都出面热烈地欢迎我代表团。代表团所参观或游览的地方，到处都飘扬着欢迎的旗帜，到处都可以听到掌声和欢呼声。在东京，代表团所住旅馆的门前，欢迎的人群始终未断；在名古屋，欢迎的歌声彻夜地响亮；代表团抵达京都时，京都车站的欢迎群众就有三万多人。日本朋友们说：今天这里的喜悦情形要比任何节日还热闹；在大阪，成千上万的群众夹道欢迎。当代表团乘火车从东京去名古屋时，在沿途停车站和原野里都有打着中国国旗、日本国旗和红十字旗的欢迎行列；当代表团乘汽车从京都到大阪时，在六十多公里长的“京阪公路”上，欢迎的人群络绎不绝。不仅如此，还有许多群众团体在九州、中国、北海道开欢迎会，会上宣读了代表团送去的感谢词；同时，从各地纷纷地寄贺电给代表团表示欢迎。所有这些，使人强烈地感觉到中日人民的友好有着良好的基础。

    代表团亲自听到了日本各阶层热望中日友好、要求加强往来和恢复中日正常关系的呼声。日本的公众领袖大山郁夫说：日本必须同亚洲各国人民团结一起，尤其是同新中国的人民团结起来。在这方面，最近接连地发生了许多使人满怀希望的事情，尤其是周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理发表的联合声明和中苏两国政府公布的联合宣言，给日本国民以很深刻的影响。日本参议院议长河井弥八说：从日本的立场说，必须尽早地建立中日两国的和平关系，加深人民的友好，开展文化与贸易交流，日本才能得到和平和繁荣。这次中国红十字会代表团的访问日本，给予中日两国友好往来以良好机会。大阪府知事赤间文三说：中国的和平友好政策使我们感到兴奋。京都府知事蜷川虎三说，日本人民愿意和中国人民共同为增进日中友好和加强经济往来而努力。日本经济团体联合会副会长植村甲午郎说：现在日中两国的经济关系虽然处于不自然的状态，但是我认为这种状态不应长久继续，在不久的将来一定会由于大多数人们的努力而正常起来。我相信，由于李会长这回访日，一定会加深日中两国的相互了解，促进日中两国间的友好，并使经济交流向前发展。日本国际贸易促进协会副会长田岛正雄在关西地区经济界一百八十人的欢迎宴会上说：我们相信随着中国建设的进展，中日两国可以互相增进经济交流。我们对发展中日两国经济交流的希望是很殷切的。最近世界各国之间，不管政治组织和社会制度的不同，认为可能和平共处和要求促进东西贸易的声浪，日益澎湃。在这种情况下，日本也认为无论如何总要促进中日两国间的贸易关系，这已成为绝大多数经济界人士的公论。东京法政大学校长大内兵卫、东京学习院大学校长安倍能成强调地指出中日两国从速恢复正常关系对东方与世界和平的重要性。京都立命馆大学校长末川博说：日本人民同中国人民一样是衷心盼望和平和友好的。所以，我们绝对不能容许使亚洲人打亚洲人的政策。大阪大学校长今村荒男说：战后，日本人民处在极其复杂而困难的内外环境之中，大多数的人们都是对中国抱着亲密的感情的。我们相信中日两国人民即使有政治主义上的不同，也可以互相握手共存共处，这是无可置疑的。在这种意义上，我们希望中国红十字会代表团的访问日本能够成为中日两国友好合作的开端。日本的舆论界方面，“中部日本新闻”社社长与良说：中国红十字会代表团的访问日本，给日本全国以很大影响；给名古屋市民以莫大的感动，所有这些，将使中日两国人民的友好合作日益加深。不久前由日本社会名流成立的恢复日中日苏邦交国民会议在致代表团的感谢决议中写道：我们深深领会了中苏两国坚决不移的对日和平政策。我们坚决宣誓：一定要加强日本全国国民的团结，拿出百倍的勇气，为全面恢复与中苏两国的邦交而努力，用以回答中国红十字会代表团在日本的友好访问。全日本妇女团体联合会会长平冢雷鸟说：日本能初次邀请新中国的和平使节，这是爱好和平的日本妇女最喜欢的事情，因为这可以加强中日两国的了解和友好，促进亚洲和世界的和平。她并且说：中苏两国政府关于对日关系的联合宣言给了日本妇女很大的希望。日本工会总评议会主席藤田藤太郎说：日本人民殷切地希望中国红十字会代表团的访问，能成为将来中日友好的出发点。此外日本的农民、渔业、宗教、医学等各界团体的代表都从各个角度谈出了热望日中友好的心情。
    中国红十字会代表团通过这次访问，把中国人民愿意同日本人民长期友好、和平共处的意愿和决心，明确而诚恳地转告给日本人民和日本的广泛社会阶层。我们也受到日本人民和日本广泛社会阶层的热烈欢迎，并亲自看到他们同中国人民有着一样的热望和平与友好的要求。这就加深了中日两国人民的友谊，同时也使中国人民和日本各方面的接触与来往范围更加扩大，使更多的日本朋友了解中国的和平政策和中国人民为保卫亚洲与世界和平而努力的坚强意志，从而使中日两国人民间的了解向前推进了一步。不仅如此，通过这次访问，使中日两国人民对增进中日两国的友好关系互相受到鼓舞，增加了保卫和平的勇气和信心。中日两国人民确信：只要两国人民共同努力，中日间的问题是可以解决的，中日间的正常关系是可以建立的；只要两国人民相互团结，中日两国是可以和平共处的，任何外来的阻力都不能破坏中日的友好与和平共处；同时，只要两国人民加强友好，亚洲的和平基础是会日益巩固的。所有这些，都是给那些一直在阻止中日友好的美国好战分子们以有力的挫折，也给美国的走狗蒋介石卖国集团以沉重打击。
    通过这次访问，使我们感到要求加强中日间文化交流和经济往来确实是中日人民的共同愿望，同时也是目前的实际需要。日本的经济界、文化界以及整个社会舆论都在要求加强中日往来，特别是发展贸易关系。日本朋友们热烈地希望中国红十字会代表团的这次访问日本能够成为今后加强两国之间往来的良好开端。当代表团的访问进入末期时，我们已听到日本的有关方面开始在准备邀请中国贸易代表团访问日本。同时，代表团在和日本各界交谈时，也一再表示欢迎日本各方面的团体或代表能有机会继续访问中国。所有这些都在说明，中国红十字会代表团的访问日本，已为今后两国人民加强往来造成了更多的可能，开辟了较宽的道路。
    在这次访问中我们还深深地体察到日本社会各阶层都要求和平，并热切盼望日本与中国搞好关系。绝大多数的人流露出不愿处在美国半占领的情况下。为了和平与和中国的友好，日本各阶层的人士正显露出广泛团结的动向，而且这种团结的动向有着逐渐扩大的趋势。这种趋势将是阻止日本的军国主义复活与美国利用日本军国主义扰乱亚洲及世界和平的一个有力因素。
