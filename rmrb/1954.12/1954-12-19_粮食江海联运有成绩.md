Achievements in Grain River-Sea Intermodal Transportation

    According to the agreement signed by the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Food, river-sea intermodal transportation of grain shipped from Sichuan Province has been piloted since April this year. Starting from the twenty-one ports in Sichuan Province downstream of Chongqing, connecting the Yangtze River to the Northern Ocean route all the way to Dalian Port, the shipping department is responsible for the transfer, loading and unloading, and handover of grain at all ports along the way. After implementing this method, the grain department abolished the transfer stations originally set up in Yichang, Hankou, Shanghai, and other places, saving a large amount of manpower and expenses for loading, unloading, and storage at transfer ports. The turnover rate and load factor of shipping vessels have also increased compared to before, saving transportation capacity for the country.

    In order to promote material exchange and fully utilize the coordinating role of water transportation with land transportation, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Food recently jointly decided to pilot water-land intermodal transportation of grain starting from February next year. When piloting this method, Dalian Port will be used as the transshipment point, and 121 stations in the Northeast region, such as Qiqihar, will be used as intermodal stations. Hankou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Tianshenggang along the Yangtze River will be used as intermodal ports on the Yangtze River, and Shanghai, Lianyungang, Qingdao, Yantai, Ningbo, Qinhuangdao, and Tianjin will be used as maritime intermodal ports. In the future, rice, flour, paddy, and wheat transported from coastal ports and Yangtze River ports to the Northeast via Shanghai, and miscellaneous grains transported from the Northeast to coastal ports and Yangtze River ports via Shanghai, will be handled by the transportation and railway departments in Dalian for intermodal transportation.

    From December 11th to 15th, relevant personnel from the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Food concentrated on studying the methods of water-land intermodal transportation of grain.

    粮食江海联运有成绩
    根据交通部和粮食部签订的协议，从今年四月份起，由四川省运出的粮食试行了江海联运。从四川省境内重庆以下的二十一个港口起，顺长江联接北洋线一直到大连港，沿途各港口的粮食中转、装卸、交接等工作，都由航运部门负责办理。试行这一办法以后，粮食部门撤销了原来设在宜昌、汉口、上海等地的转运站，节省了大批人力，并节省了中转港口的装卸、堆存等费用。航运部门船只周转速度及载重率也比以前提高，为国家节省了运输力。
    交通部、铁道部、粮食部为了促进物资交流，充分发挥水运对陆运的配合作用，最近共同研究决定，从明年二月份起试办粮食水陆联运。在试行这一办法的时候，将以大连港作为换装点，以东北区的齐齐哈尔等一百二十一个车站作为联运站，以长江沿岸的汉口、镇江、南京、天生港作为长江上的联运港，以上海、连云港、青岛、烟台、宁波、秦皇岛、天津作为海上联运港。以后从沿海各港口和从长江各港口经上海运往东北的大米、面粉、稻谷、小麦，从东北运往沿海各港口和经上海运往长江各港口的杂粮，都将在大连由交通和铁道部门办理联运。
    十二月十一日到十五日，铁道、交通、粮食三个部的有关工作人员集中学习了粮食水陆联运办法。
