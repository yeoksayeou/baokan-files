    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 28th: Heads of Japanese economic circles are intensifying their activities to urge the merger of the Japanese Democratic Party and the Liberal Party.
    Ishikawa Ichiro, chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, Fujiyama Aiichiro, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and other business leaders, hosted a banquet on the 27th for Ichiro Hatoyama, president of the Japanese Democratic Party, and Nobusuke Kishi, secretary-general, and others. At the banquet, the business leaders emphasized to the Democratic Party leaders that in order to stabilize the political situation, the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party must unite and "work together." They also demanded the early realization of the merger of conservative parties. Prior to this, they had hosted a banquet on the 24th for Takeo Ogata, president of the Liberal Party, and others, making the same demands.
    According to Kyodo News, the Japanese Democratic Party expressed its willingness to accept the opinions of the business community, but it believes that it is difficult to merge the conservative parties before the general election. Kyodo News said that although there are difficulties in merging the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party before the general election, the business community still hopes that the two parties, whose basic policies do not differ, will conclude an agreement on "territory" during the election, or otherwise approach each other, so as to create a situation for the merger after the election. Kyodo News also revealed that the business community will continue to carry out activities in the political arena in the future, using the election funds they provide as a weapon, based on this policy.

    日本经济界首脑
    加紧促使民主党和自由党合并
    【新华社二十八日讯】东京消息：日本经济界首脑正在加紧活动，促使日本民主党和自由党合并。
    日本经济团体联合会会长石川一郎、日本商工会议所会长藤山爱一郎等实业界领袖，二十七日宴请日本民主党总裁鸠山一郎、干事长岸信介等人。实业界首脑在席上向民主党领袖强调要使政治局势稳定，民主党和自由党必须联合起来，“团结一致”。他们并且要求早日实现保守政党的合并。在这以前，他们曾在二十四日宴请自由党总裁绪方竹虎等人，提出了同样的要求。
    据共同社报道，日本民主党表示愿意接受实业界的意见，但是它认为在大选以前使保守政党合并是难以实现的。共同社说，虽然在大选以前使民主党和自由党合并存在困难，但是，实业界还是希望这两个基本政策并无分歧的政党在大选的时候要缔结关于“地盘”的协议，或在其他方面互相接近，以便在大选以后造成合并的形势。共同社又透露，实业界方面今后将根据这种政策，用他们提供的选举资金为武器，继续对政界进行活动。
