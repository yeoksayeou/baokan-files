    The leading cadres of Suzhou Quartz Mine Cooperative should not resist criticism
    To the Editor:
    On May 8th of this year, the Shanghai Liberation Daily published a reader's letter criticizing the Suzhou Local State-Owned Suzhou Quartz Mine Cooperative (Factory) for not paying attention to safety in production, along with an investigation report by reporter Liu Chun. Instead of inspecting and improving their work based on the criticism, the factory's leading cadres used the names of workers to resist the newspaper's criticism.
    The products of the Suzhou Quartz Mine Cooperative are quartz sand and quartz powder. Doing a good job in dust prevention is the main issue in solving the factory's safety in production. Although the factory has set up some dust prevention equipment, because the leadership lacks sufficient understanding of the hazards of dust, they single-mindedly pursue output in production and do not actively work to overcome objective difficulties in safety in production, resulting in dust like fog in the workshop for a long time, seriously affecting the health of workers.
    After the Liberation Daily criticized this phenomenon, Chen Jiping, the director of the Suzhou Quartz Mine Cooperative, and Gao Hongzhi, the deputy director, were very dissatisfied, saying that "not a single problem in the criticism conformed to the facts" and that they would write to the former East China Regional People's Supervisory Committee and the Liberation Daily to "collectively deal with the reporter." Gao Hongzhi wrote the letter at the time; Chen Jiping came up with the method of "having the workers come forward" and revised the wording of the letter to be even stronger. A factory affairs meeting was held on May 10th to discuss how to deal with the Liberation Daily's criticism. Chen Jiping and Gao Hongzhi said at the meeting that they had always attached importance to safety in production, that the Liberation Daily's criticism was groundless, and proposed that if the higher authorities were to investigate, they would need to prepare in advance. On the morning of the 11th, a technicians' meeting was held. Chen Jiping said that the workers in the suburban workshop had "great" opinions on the Liberation Daily's criticism and asked everyone to represent the workers in writing letters (in fact, he wanted everyone to sign the letter he had written himself). At the meeting, one technician said: "Our dust problem has indeed not been resolved." Chen Jiping immediately said: "This is because the working conditions are not good, I have already mentioned it in my letter." Technician Gao Shaoliang, seeing his name listed as one of the "representatives of all workers," quickly stated that he was not a worker representative. Chen Jiping said: "You are a member of the working class, so you can be a worker representative."
    After this incident occurred, Comrade Wang Jimin, the secretary of the factory's Party branch, raised his opinion, but Chen Jiping criticized him for being "liberal" and "not resolute in the struggle." The Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Suzhou Municipal Committee sent an inspection team to talk to Chen Jiping and Gao Hongzhi, but they still did not reveal the truth, insisting that writing the letter was an "automatic request" of the workers.
    It should be pointed out that Chen Jiping and Gao Hongzhi's erroneous attitude is consistent. After they achieved some success in the Quartz Mine Cooperative, they developed feelings of pride and even adopted a resistant attitude towards opinions from higher authorities. For example, last year, the Suzhou Municipal Labor Bureau asked them to revise and submit the labor protection contract for approval, but they refused to comply. Gao Hongzhi even said: "It is up to the Labor Bureau to approve or not, and it is up to us to implement or not." In April of this year, Comrade Kang Ke, the former deputy secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, criticized the factory's leadership for complacency at the first quarter production summary meeting. Chen Jiping complained a lot and even made excuses not to attend the meeting that afternoon. Chen Jiping and others also showed great disrespect to the Municipal Bureau of Industry, spreading erroneous remarks among the masses such as "The Bureau of Industry only knows how to muddle through at the top" and "Gu Qun (director of the Bureau of Industry) is bureaucratic."
    Through the education of the leading cadres of the CPC Suzhou Municipal Committee, Chen Jiping and Gao Hongzhi's attitudes have changed somewhat. Further processing is now underway. I believe that this incident occurred after studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, which shows that opposing bourgeois individualism is a long-term and serious struggle, and it is worthy of serious vigilance from Party organizations in various places.

### 苏州石英矿产社领导干部不该抗拒批评

    苏州石英矿产社领导干部不该抗拒批评编辑同志：
    今年五月八日，上海解放日报刊登了读者指针批评苏州市地方国营苏州石英矿产社（厂）不重视安全生产的来信和记者刘椿的调查报告。厂里的领导干部不是根据批评来检查和改进工作，反而假借职工名义抗拒报纸的批评。
    苏州石英矿产社的产品是石英砂和石英粉，做好防尘工作是解决厂里安全生产的主要问题。厂里虽然设置了一些防尘设备，但是因为领导方面对粉尘的危害性认识不足，生产中单纯追求产量，而没有积极努力地克服安全生产中的客观困难，以致车间长期来粉尘如雾，严重影响了职工的健康。
    解放日报对这种现象提出批评后，苏州石英矿产社正厂长陈季平、副厂长高鸿志大为不满，说是批评中“没有一个问题符合事实”，要写信到原华东区人民监察委员会和解放日报去“集中搞记者”。高鸿志当时就执笔写信；陈季平想出了“由工人出面”的办法，还把信中措辞改得更强硬一些。五月十日召开厂务会议，讨论怎样对付解放日报的批评问题。陈季平、高鸿志两人在会上说：他们对安全生产是一贯重视的，解放日报的批评毫无根据；并提出上级一定要来调查，事先需要准备准备。十一日上午，又召开了技工会议，陈季平说是城外车间工人对解放日报批评的意见“很大”，叫大家代表工人写信（实际上是让大家在他自己写的信上签名）。会上有一位技工说：“我们的粉尘问题确实没有解决。”陈季平马上说：“这是因为劳动条件不好，我信上已经提到了。”技工高少良看到他的名字被列为“全厂工人代表”之一，连忙声明自己不是工人代表。陈季平说：“你是工人阶级，就好当工人代表。”
    这个事件发生后，厂里的党支部书记王济民同志提出了意见，陈季平反而批评他“自由主义”，“斗争不坚决”。中共苏州市委纪律检查委员会派了检查组来和陈季平、高鸿志谈话，他们还不交代真实情况，硬说写信是工人“自动要求”的。
    应该指出：陈季平、高鸿志的这种错误态度是有一贯性的。他们在石英矿产社工作有了一些成绩后，就滋长了骄傲情绪，甚至对来自上级的意见也采取了抗拒的态度。如去年苏州市劳动局让他们重新修订报批的劳保合同，他们拒不遵行，高鸿志还说：“批不批由劳动局，执行不执行由我们。”今年四月前市委副书记康克同志在第一季度生产总结会议上批评了该厂领导上的骄傲自满情绪，陈季平就大发牢骚，当天下午还借故不参加会议。陈季平等对市工业局也很不尊重，曾在群众中散布“工业局只知道在上面混口饭吃吃”，“顾群（工业局局长）官僚主义”等错误言论。
    经过中共苏州市委领导干部的教育，陈季平和高鸿志的态度已经有了一些转变。现在，正在作进一步的处理。我认为这件事情发生在学习四中全会文件以后，说明了反对资产阶级个人主义是一个长期的严肃的斗争，值得各地党组织严重警惕。
