Factories in Shenyang That Completed Their Plans Ahead of Schedule Propose Goals for Increased Production and Savings Before the New Year

　　In the half-month from November 16th to 30th, the Shenyang Canvas Factory, the Shenyang Leather Products Factory, and other factories in Shenyang completed their annual state plans ahead of schedule. The Shenyang Iron Smelting Factory, the Shenyang Bottle Factory, the Shenyang Marble Factory, the Shenyang Starch Factory, and others completed their November state plans ahead of schedule. The Sujiatun Railway Station also completed its annual loading plan ahead of schedule on November 22nd. These factories that completed their plans ahead of schedule have all proposed goals for increased production and savings. The Shenyang Canvas Factory, after completing its annual state plan 49 days ahead of schedule, estimates that it can increase production and save 12 billion yuan in wealth by the end of the year. The Shenyang Starch Factory, while completing its November state plan ahead of schedule, also used corn germ (the factory's production residue) to extract 20,900 catties of vegetable oil (which can be used to make hardened oil soap or coatings), saving the state more than 80 tons of soybeans. The state-owned Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory will complete 72 kinds of products from November to the end of the year (including those manufactured but not completed). These products are mainly supplied to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Shenyang Wire Factory, Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, and other units for capital construction. The factory handed the detailed measures for manufacturing these products to the workers for discussion, guaranteeing that they would be delivered ahead of schedule according to the estimated dates, and on this basis, increase production and save 8.5 billion yuan in wealth for the country. The Shenyang Textile Factory estimates that it can save 11,637 kilograms of raw cotton and 6,149 kilograms of raw yarn from November this year to the end of the first quarter of next year. The yarn saved can be woven into cloth sufficient for 6,353 people to make a new set of clothes each (calculated at 17 feet of cloth per set of clothes). The Shenyang Gunny Bag Factory has recently switched to using green ramie to weave gunny bags (originally using jute), which is expected to save 5 billion yuan a year. The Shenyang Cigarette Factory workers saved more than 11,000 kilograms of tobacco leaves in October. Recently, the factory's fermentation workers and testers, in the process of learning advanced Soviet fermentation methods, improved the operating methods. In addition to improving the quality of tobacco leaf fermentation, it is expected to reduce costs by more than 10 billion yuan a year.
