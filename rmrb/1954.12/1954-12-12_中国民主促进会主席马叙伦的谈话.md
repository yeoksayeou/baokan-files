China Association for Promoting Democracy Chairman Ma Xulun's Talk

Ignoring the repeated warnings of the Chinese government and people, U.S. imperialism has brazenly signed a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This "treaty" illegally violates our country's sovereignty, blatantly occupies our country's territory, seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world, and endangers the interests of the people of Asia and the world. This is the most shameless of the traitorous treaties ever signed by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and it is also the most blatant manifestation of the U.S. aggressive clique's consistent hostility towards the Chinese people and its preparations to expand its war policy. The Chinese people must smash this sinister treaty of expanding aggression and war!

Our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has issued a solemn statement, declaring to the world the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan, and pointing out that the Chinese people resolutely oppose war, but will never be intimidated by the threat of war. If anyone insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people will resolutely strike back at the interventionists and provocateurs. Foreign Minister Zhou's statement fully represents the unshakeable common will of our 600 million compatriots. Every Chinese person must fight to the end to implement this determination. The Chinese people will never give up until Taiwan is liberated!

The fact is very clear that the U.S.-Chiang treaty not only threatens China, but also greatly worsens the situation in the Far East and Asia, and threatens the security of the countries in the Far East and Asia. Dulles openly stated: "This treaty will become another link in the collective security (should be read as war) system established by the various collective defense (should be read as aggression) treaties that the United States has concluded with other countries in the Pacific region." He wants to use this treaty as a link in the Northeast Asia alliance, connect it with the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and other aggressive treaties, and connect it with the North Atlantic aggressive pact, in order to launch a war against Asia and the world. Isn't it very obvious that the U.S. aggressive clique is not only targeting the People's Republic of China, but also targeting the countries of Asia with the spearhead of war?

For several years, the United States has launched an aggressive war in Korea, armed and occupied our country's territory of Taiwan, and stepped up its support for France's colonial war in Indochina, encircling our country from these three fronts. As the world's peace forces have grown stronger, and the flames of war in Korea and Indochina have been extinguished, the situation in the Far East and Asia has begun to ease. After the Geneva Conference, in order to continue to ease the situation in Asia, our country clearly proposed that the United States should withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, and stop interfering in our internal affairs. At the same time, our country, together with India and Burma, jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which has been warmly welcomed by the people of Asian countries and is increasingly gaining popularity. Under such circumstances, if the United States truly has no aggressive ambitions, and withdraws its armed forces in Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, and if everyone can abide by these five principles and strive to expand the area of peace, then the tense situation in the Far East and Asia will inevitably continue to ease.

However, the U.S. aggressive clique not only hates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China, India, and Burma, but also tries its best to undermine these five principles. The U.S. aggressive clique has not only not withdrawn its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, but has instead instructed the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to more rampantly carry out harassment and destructive wars against the Chinese mainland. Now, the United States has gone even further and signed this aggressive war treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This shows that it is the United States that is creating new tensions in the Far East and Asia and strengthening the threat of war against the Far East and Asia. The U.S. aggressive clique is not only an enemy of the Chinese people, but also an enemy of the people of Asian countries.

Therefore, the Taiwan issue has now become a key issue in maintaining peace in the Far East and Asia. All Asian countries and people who truly desire peace cannot and should not stand idly by in the face of the crimes of the U.S. aggressors in forcibly occupying our country's territory of Taiwan, undermining peace in the Far East and Asia, and preparing to expand the war. Historical lessons clearly tell us that the Japanese imperialists first invaded China and then invaded various Asian countries, finally triggering the Pacific War. Appeasement and condoning of war policies endangers world peace. The painful memories of the Pearl Harbor incident in 1941 are still fresh in the minds of the people of Asia and the Pacific. The U.S. aggressive clique is now following the old path of the Japanese imperialists. Today, they forcibly occupy Taiwan, and tomorrow they will trample on the security of various Asian countries. The people of Asian countries must unite and take measures to stop the war chariot of U.S. imperialism in time. As our Foreign Minister Zhou stated in his statement: "The Chinese people understand that only by resisting aggression can we defend peace." (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦的谈话
    美帝国主义悍然不顾中国政府和人民的一再警告，竟和蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”。这个“条约”非法地侵犯我国主权，公然地强占我国领土，严重地威胁亚洲和世界的和平，危害亚洲和世界人民的利益。这是蒋介石卖国集团曾经签订过的卖国条约中最无耻的一个条约，也是美国侵略集团一贯地敌视中国人民，准备扩大战争政策最露骨的表现。中国人民一定要粉碎这个罪恶的扩大侵略和战争的条约！
    我国周恩来外长已发表严正的声明，向全世界宣告中国人民一定要解放台湾的决心，并且指出中国人民坚决地反对战争，但是决不会被战争威胁吓倒。如果有人硬要把战争强加在中国人民的头上，中国人民一定要对干涉者和挑衅者给以坚决的回击。周外长的声明完全代表我国六万万同胞的不可动摇的共同意志，每一个中国人民一定要为贯彻这个决心而奋斗到底，中国人民不解放台湾决不罢休！
    事实很显然，美蒋条约不仅威胁中国，而且大大地恶化了远东和亚洲的局势，威胁远东和亚洲各国的安全。杜勒斯就公开表示：“这个条约将成为美国同太平洋地区的其他国家已经缔结的各种集体防御（应读作侵略）条约所建立的集体安全（应读作战争）体系中的另一个环节。”他就是要把这个条约作为东北亚联盟的一环，和东南亚侵略集团以及其他侵略条约联在一起，并且和北大西洋侵略公约联在一起，以向亚洲和全世界发动战争。美国侵略集团不但把战争矛头针对着中华人民共和国，而且还针对着亚洲各国，不是非常明显吗？
    几年以来，美国在朝鲜发动侵略战争，武装侵占我国领土台湾，加紧支持法国在印度支那的殖民战争，从这三个战线上包围我国。由于世界和平力量的壮大，朝鲜和印度支那的战火被扑灭以后，远东和亚洲的形势开始有了和缓。在日内瓦会议之后，我国为了继续缓和亚洲局势，曾明确地提出美国应该从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量，停止干涉我国内政。同时，我国又和印度、缅甸共同倡议和平共处的五项原则，受到亚洲各国人民的热烈欢迎，日益深入人心。在这样情况之下，如果美国确无侵略野心，撤退在台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡的武装力量，如果大家能遵守这五项原则，努力扩大和平地区，那么远东和亚洲的紧张局势必然继续趋于缓和。
    但是美国侵略集团却不但仇视中国和印度、缅甸共同倡议的和平共处的五项原则，而且还竭力破坏这五项原则，美国侵略集团不但没有从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走它的武装力量，而且反而指使蒋介石卖国集团更加猖獗地对中国大陆进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争。现在，美国更变本加厉，又同蒋介石卖国集团缔结了这个侵略的战争条约。这就说明了，制造远东和亚洲新的紧张局势，加强对远东和亚洲的战争威胁的正是美国。美国侵略集团不但和中国的人民为敌，而且还和亚洲各国人民为敌。
    所以，目前台湾问题实际上已成为维护远东和亚洲和平的关键问题。一切真正期望和平的亚洲国家和人民，对于美国侵略者强占我国领土台湾、破坏远东和亚洲和平、准备扩大战争的这种罪行，当然不能也不应该袖手坐视。历史教训很清楚的告诉我们，当年日本帝国主义先侵略中国，后侵略亚洲各国，终于掀起太平洋的战争。对战争政策的绥靖和纵容就是对世界和平的危害。一九四一年珍珠港事变的教训对亚洲和太平洋各国人民的惨痛记忆犹新。美国侵略集团现在走日本帝国主义的老路。今天强占台湾，明天就会蹂躏亚洲各国的安全。亚洲各国人民必须团结起来，采取措施，及时阻止美帝国主义的战车。正如我国周外长在声明中所说：“中国人民懂得，只有反抗侵略，才能保卫和平。”（新华社）
