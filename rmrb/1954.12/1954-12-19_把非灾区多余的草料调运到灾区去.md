    To the Editor:

    In some districts and townships of Xiangcheng, Yongcheng, Dancheng, Shenqiu, and Luyi in the Shangqiu Special District of Henan Province, due to this year's floods, grain production has decreased, and livestock fodder is also very scarce. This has resulted in livestock becoming weak and prone to disease, and disaster victims selling their draught animals. Because most disaster-stricken farmers find it difficult to buy back livestock after selling them, it will greatly affect next year's spring plowing.

    However, in non-disaster areas such as Minquan and Taikang in this special district, there is surplus fodder everywhere, and farmers hope the government can find ways to transport it out. Ge Shengliang of Sihe Village, Second District, Minquan, only feeds one cow and has 4,000 catties of grass. He only needs 1,800 catties to feed it until March next year, leaving a surplus of more than 2,000 catties. The Likangji Agricultural Production Cooperative in Litang Township has so much grass that it cannot be processed, so it has to chop wheat straw to make manure. There is even more grass in the Huangfan District of Taikang County. The Huanggang Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huangji Township, Fifth District, plans to sell 150,000 catties of grass, and the Hongda Agricultural Production Cooperative plans to sell 70,000 to 80,000 catties. The Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Su Xiaozhuang Village in this township feeds eleven head of livestock. After feeding the livestock until March next year, the cooperative will still have 50,000 to 60,000 catties of grass left.

    In non-disaster areas, straw is piled up like mountains, while livestock in disaster areas lack fodder. Why not allocate it? The main reason is that the relevant leading departments do not care about solving the problem of livestock feed in disaster areas. Of course, it is not easy to transport fodder to disaster areas, but as long as the leadership truly cares about the production and life of the masses, these transportation difficulties can be solved. 　Sheng Jianhua

### 把非灾区多余的草料调运到灾区去

    把非灾区多余的草料调运到灾区去编辑同志：
    河南省商邱专区项城、永城、郸城、沈邱、鹿邑等地部分区、乡，因为今年遭了水灾，粮食减产，牲口草料也非常缺乏。因而造成了牲口瘦弱多病和灾民出卖耕畜的现象。由于一般受灾农民卖出了牲口以后，就很难有力量再买回来。这样，将会大大影响明年的春耕。
      但是在本专区的民权、太康等未受灾的地区，却到处都有余草，农民希望政府能设法往外运。民权二区四合村葛盛亮只喂一条牛，有草四千斤，喂到明年三月只需一千八百斤就够了，还多余二千多斤；李塘乡李康集农业生产合作社，草太多了无法处理，只好把麦秸切来沤了粪。太康县黄泛区一带草更多，五区黄集乡黄岗前进农业生产合作社准备卖草十五万斤，宏大农业生产合作社准备卖七、八万斤；这乡苏小庄村胜利农业生产合作社，喂牲口十一头，社里的草料除了把牲口喂到明年三月以外，还可以剩五、六万斤草。
    非灾区秸草堆积如山，而灾区牲口却缺少草料，为什么不加以调拨呢？主要是有关领导部门不关心解决灾区牲口的饲料问题。当然要把草料运到灾区去是一件不很容易的事情，但是只要领导方面真正关心群众的生产和生活，这种运输上的困难是可以解决的。　盛健华
