    The twenty-first of December is the anniversary of the birth of Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the great successor to Lenin’s immortal cause. The life and activities of J.V. Stalin are inseparable from the heroic history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people’s struggle for communism, and the development of the world liberation movement. As a loyal student and comrade-in-arms of Lenin, J.V. Stalin tirelessly struggled to liberate the working class and all working people from the shackles of exploiters, to save humanity from devastating wars, for peace, for the freedom and happiness of working people, for democracy, and for communism. Stalin's life's work is an inspiring example of selfless service to the people. Stalin’s name rightfully stands alongside such scientific masters as Marx, Engels, and Lenin. J.V. Stalin summarized the rich experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the experience of the modern world liberation movement, creatively further developed the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism in accordance with the new historical conditions, and enriched revolutionary theory with new principles on a number of issues. J.V. Stalin embarked on Lenin's path from the very beginning of his revolutionary activities. He was one of Lenin's closest comrades-in-arms in establishing and consolidating a militant revolutionary party, a party of a new type. The Communist Party, battle-hardened under the leadership of the brilliant Lenin, established an alliance between the working class and the working peasantry, and, thanks to the victorious Great October Socialist Revolution, ensured the overthrow of the power of capitalists and landlords and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, bringing forth the world's first socialist state.
    U.I. Lenin formulated a scientifically based program to transform economically backward Russia into an advanced and powerful socialist country. The Communist Party guided the people to use their infinite and creative strength to realize Lenin's plan for building socialism. After the death of U.I. Lenin, enemies of the Party and the people, such as Trotskyites, Bukharinites, and bourgeois nationalists, attempted to divert the Party from the path of Leninism, to split the Party, to undermine the confidence of the working class and peasants in the possibility of building socialism in the Soviet Union; they further attempted to eliminate Soviet power and the socialist revolution. The Communist Party, under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by J.V. Stalin, eradicated these traitors and capitulators, defended Leninism and the unity, rock-solidness, and consistency of the Party ranks, and resolutely took the road of building socialism in the Soviet Union. J.V. Stalin developed and enriched Lenin’s theory on the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country. He formulated the basis of the Party’s policy of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization. The Communist Party instilled in the Soviet people immense confidence in their strength, inspired and mobilized them to fight for the realization of the great socialist transformation. Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by J.V. Stalin, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, following the path pointed out by Lenin, ensured that the Soviet people became the first in history to build socialism – a new social system – and transformed their motherland into a powerful industrial and collectivized agricultural country. The victory of the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union fundamentally improved the material living standards of the Soviet people, thereby strengthening the Soviet state and its defense capabilities. In the struggle for the victory of socialism, the worker-peasant alliance was further consolidated. The Communist Party eliminated the economic and cultural backwardness of formerly oppressed peoples, united the various nationalities within the country into a fraternal great family; it established the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics – a powerful multinational state.
    The establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was a victory for the Lenin-Stalin national policy. J.V. Stalin once pointed out that the victory of socialism liberated and strengthened the powerful driving forces of Soviet society, such as spiritual and political unity, the friendship of all nationalities of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and Soviet patriotism. The Great Patriotic War against the German fascist invaders was the greatest test of the strength and unity of the Soviet society and state system. The Soviet state gloriously withstood this test. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people and the glorious Soviet army defeated the fascist invaders, not only defending the freedom and independence of their motherland, but also liberating the people of Europe and Asia from fascist enslavement. All progressive humanity is well aware of the important role played by J.V. Stalin in achieving these historic victories, who at that time led the Soviet Defense Committee and the Soviet Armed Forces during the war years. The victory of the Soviet Union over the fascist invaders fundamentally changed the entire international situation. A new and powerful force appeared on the world stage – the invincible camp of truly democratic, peace-loving countries headed by the Soviet Union, which is the greatest achievement of free people.
    Guided by the invincible doctrine of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is victoriously carrying out the great task of building communism. Since the death of J.V. Stalin, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union – a reliable and wise leading body composed of students and comrades-in-arms of Lenin and Stalin – has continued to lead the Communist Party and the Soviet people firmly and confidently along the Leninist path toward new victories.
    The resolutions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the works of Lenin and Stalin's students and comrades-in-arms are a further creative development of Marxist-Leninist theory. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has formulated a detailed program for strengthening socialist society and ensuring the gradual transition from socialism to communism, which is necessary for the comprehensive development of the socialist economy and culture. The Soviet people are implementing this plan with unparalleled enthusiasm and energy.
    Due to the wise foreign policy of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union (which has received broad support from all peace-loving people), the prestige of the Soviet Union in the world has risen to an unprecedented level. The aim of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union is to further vigorously develop the productive forces of Soviet society, enhance the material and cultural well-being of the working people, and consolidate world peace. This policy has received the unlimited support of the entire Soviet people. The Party has complete faith in the strength of the people and the revolutionary drive of the people; the Party and the people have close and inseparable ties. The great unity of the Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people is the source of the strength and power of the Soviet state.
    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union holds high the banner of proletarian internationalism. The historical experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the works of Lenin and Stalin are of great significance to the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of all countries. The Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of the people's democratic countries have drawn rich experience in the struggle for socialism from the works of Lenin and Stalin and from the resolutions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and have creatively applied these experiences to the specific conditions of their own countries. The Communist Parties and Workers' Parties in capitalist, colonial, and dependent countries draw from this rich treasure trove of revolutionary theory knowledge about the laws of social development and methods for the revolutionary transformation of society. The Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of all countries are drawing on the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and are carrying out important work to consolidate their ranks ideologically and organizationally. Of great importance in these activities is the adoption of the Leninist norms of Party life, strict adherence to the principles of collective leadership, the development of criticism and self-criticism, arming Party members with revolutionary theory, and comprehensively expanding ties with the masses.
    In his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, J.V. Stalin called upon the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of capitalist countries to raise the banner of bourgeois democratic freedoms and the banner of national independence and national sovereignty, which had been abandoned by the bourgeoisie. Following this advice, the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties are tirelessly striving to build the unity of the working class and unite all national and patriotic forces. The ideas of Leninism inspire the Communist Parties of all countries to fight for the vital interests of the working people, for the national independence of their motherlands, and for democracy and peace.
    In their activities, the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union are guided by the Lenin-Stalin principle of the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the socialist system and the capitalist system. J.V. Stalin repeatedly pointed out that the Soviet Union proceeds from the fact that the two systems, socialism and capitalism, will inevitably coexist for a long period. It resolutely adheres to the policy of establishing honest and peaceful relations with all countries willing to cooperate in a friendly manner, as long as the principles of mutual understanding are observed and the obligations undertaken are fulfilled. The Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union steadfastly pursue a policy of peace and actively struggle to consolidate peace and international security. The People’s Republic of China and all the European and Asian People’s Democratic countries are fighting alongside the Soviet Union for the great cause of peace. World events prove that the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, France, and certain other countries have embarked on the dangerous path of establishing aggressive military blocs and reviving German militarism, thereby exacerbating the entire international situation. The Paris Agreements stipulate the remilitarization of West Germany and the establishment of a West German army led by former Hitlerite generals. The Paris Agreements are in complete contradiction with international agreements, especially with the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance.
    The Soviet government pointed out in its note of December 16 that the act of ratifying the Paris Agreements would nullify the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance, rendering it invalid. The full responsibility for this situation rests with France, with the French government.
    J.V. Stalin emphasized the decisive role played by the masses of the people in exposing and thwarting the conspiracies of the aggressors. All peace-loving people remember Stalin's historically significant words: "Peace can be maintained and strengthened if the peoples take the cause of preserving peace into their own hands and defend it to the end." If the war-mongers succeed in entrapping the masses of the people with webs of lies, deceiving the masses of the people, and dragging the masses of the people into another world war, then war may become inevitable.
    Peace fighters are launching a broad, nationwide movement to expose the criminal plans of the aggressive blocs of the United States and other countries that follow the United States, and are launching a movement against the ratification of the London and Paris military agreements, against the revival of German militarism, and against the revival of the German Wehrmacht. Standing at the forefront of this struggle for peace and for the establishment of a collective security system are the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries.
    The Moscow Conference of European countries unprecedentedly demonstrated the solidarity of peace-loving countries, and this conference was a great contribution to the cause of peace.
    Lenin and Stalin repeatedly called upon peace-loving people to be vigilant. They emphasized the need to strengthen the Soviet state and its armed forces so that the Soviet state would not be given any opportunity to be exploited. The remilitarization of West Germany and the intensified aggressive activities of Western countries will force the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries to take the necessary emergency measures to counter the armed forces of increasingly aggressive countries that pose a threat to peace with their own full strength and determination to defend and maintain peace. Should the imperialist blocs dare to disrupt the peaceful life of the peoples of the democratic camp and launch a new war, it can only produce one result—the complete defeat of the aggressors.
    The great cause of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin, the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, is invincible!

    约·维·斯大林——列宁事业的伟大继承者
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”第五十一期的社论
    十二月二十一日是列宁的不朽事业的伟大继承者约瑟夫·维萨里昂诺维奇·斯大林的诞生纪念日。约·维·斯大林的一生和活动是同苏联共产党的英雄的历史、苏联人民争取共产主义的斗争、世界解放运动的发展分不开的。作为列宁的一个忠实的学生和战友，约·维·斯大林为了使工人阶级和全体劳动人民从剥削者的枷锁下解放出来，为了使人类避免毁灭性的战争，为了和平，为了劳动人民的自由和幸福生活，为了民主和为了共产主义，曾经作了不倦的斗争。斯大林的毕生事业是无我地为人民服务的一个令人鼓舞的榜样。斯大林的名字当之无愧地同马克思、恩格斯和列宁这样的科学大师并列在一起。约·维·斯大林总结了苏联社会主义建设的丰富经验和现代世界解放运动的经验，按照新的历史条件创造性地进一步发展了马克思列宁主义的学说，并在若干问题上以新的原理丰富了革命理论。约·维·斯大林从参加革命活动一开始就走上了列宁的道路。他是列宁在建立和巩固一个战斗的革命政党、一种新型的政党方面的最亲密的战友之一。在天才的列宁的领导下经过战斗锻炼的共产党，建立了工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，并且，由于胜利的伟大的十月社会主义革命，保证了资本家和地主政权的被推翻和无产阶级专政的建立，带来了世界上第一个社会主义国家。
    乌·伊·列宁拟订了一个把经济上落后的俄国改变成一个先进的强大的社会主义国家的有科学根据的纲领。共产党引导了人民把他们的无穷的和创造性的力量用来实现列宁的建设社会主义的计划。在乌·伊·列宁逝世以后，党和人民的敌人，诸如托洛茨基分子、布哈林分子和资产阶级民族主义者，企图使党脱离列宁主义的道路，企图分裂党，企图破坏工人阶级和农民对于在苏联建成社会主义的可能性的信心；他们更进一步地企图消灭苏维埃政权和社会主义革命。共产党在以约·维·斯大林为首的中央委员会的领导下铲除了这些叛变分子和投降分子，维护了列宁主义和党的队伍的团结、磐石般的稳固和一致，并且坚决地采取了在苏联建设社会主义的道路。约·维·斯大林发展了并丰富了关于社会主义在一国胜利的可能性的列宁主义理论。他拟订了党的国家社会主义工业化和农业集体化政策的基础。共产党使苏联人民对他们的力量怀有巨大的信心，启发并动员他们为实现伟大的社会主义改造而斗争。苏联共产党在以约·维·斯大林为首的中央委员会的领导下，遵循列宁所指出的道路，确保苏联人民成为历史上最先建设社会主义——一种新的社会制度——并且把他们的祖国改变成为一个强大的工业和集体化农业国的人。苏联建成社会主义的胜利使苏联人民的物质生活水平得到了根本的提高，从而加强了苏维埃国家和它的国防能力。在为争取社会主义胜利而进行的斗争中，工农联盟更加巩固了。共产党消除了过去受压迫的人民的经济和文化上的落后，把国内的各民族团结到了一个兄弟般的大家庭里；它建立了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟——一个强大的多民族的国家。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的成立是列宁—斯大林民族政策的胜利。约·维·斯大林曾经指出，社会主义的胜利解放了并且加强了苏维埃社会的强大的原动力，如像精神和政治上的团结一致，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟各族人民的友谊和苏维埃爱国主义。抵御德国法西斯侵略者的伟大卫国战争是对苏维埃社会和国家制度的力量和一致的最大考验。苏维埃国家光荣地经受了这个考验。苏联人民和光荣的苏军在共产党的领导下打垮了法西斯侵略者，不仅维护了他们祖国的自由和独立，而且同时，把欧洲和亚洲的各国人民从法西斯奴役下解救出来。全体进步人类都十分清楚约·维·斯大林在取得这些历史性的胜利中所起的重要作用，他在当时战争年代中领导了苏联国防委员会和苏联武装部队。苏联对法西斯侵略者所取得的胜利根本改变了整个国际形势。世界舞台上出现了一个新的强大力量——以苏联为首的真正民主的爱好和平的国家的不可战胜的阵营，这是自由人民的最伟大的成就。
    在战无不胜的马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林学说的指导下，苏联共产党正在胜利地执行建设共产主义这一伟大任务。自从约·维·斯大林逝世以来，苏联共产党中央委员会——由列宁和斯大林的学生和战友组成的可靠的和英明的领导机构——继续领导共产党和苏联人民坚定地和满怀信心地沿着列宁主义的道路走向新的胜利。
    苏联共产党的决议，列宁和斯大林的学生和战友的著作是马克思—列宁主义理论的一个进一步的创造性的发展。苏联共产党中央委员会制订了一项为了加强社会主义社会和保证逐步从社会主义过渡到共产主义所必需的全面发展社会主义经济和文化的详细纲领。苏联人民正以无比的热情和精力执行这一计划。
    由于苏联共产党和政府的英明的外交政策（这种政策得到了所有爱好和平的人们的广泛支持），苏联在世界上的威望提高到了空前未有的地步。苏联共产党和政府的目的在于进一步大力发展苏维埃社会的生产力、增进劳动人民的物质和文化福利、巩固世界和平的政策，得到了全体苏联人民的无限支持。党完全相信人民的力量和人民的革命动力；党和人民有着密切的和不可分割的联系。共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民的大团结是苏维埃国家的力量和威力的泉源。
    苏联共产党高举着无产阶级国际主义的旗帜。苏联共产党的历史经验、列宁和斯大林的著作对于各国共产党和工人党具有重大的意义。人民民主国家的共产党和工人党从列宁和斯大林的著作中，从苏联共产党的决议中汲取了争取社会主义的斗争的丰富的经验，并且创造性地把这些经验应用到它们本国的具体情况中。资本主义国家、殖民地国家和附属国中的共产党和工人党，从这个革命理论的丰富宝库中汲取关于社会发展法则的知识和社会的革命性改造的方法的知识。各国共产党和工人党汲取苏联共产党的经验，正在进行着从思想上和组织上来巩固自己队伍的重要工作。在这些活动中具有巨大重要意义的就是采用了列宁主义的关于党的生活的准则，以及严格遵守集体领导的原则、开展批评和自我批评、用革命的理论来武装共产党员和全面扩大同群众的联系。
    约·维·斯大林在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上所发表的演说中，号召资本主义国家的共产党和工人党举起资产阶级抛弃了的资产阶级民主的自由的旗帜，民族独立和民族主权的旗帜。共产党和工人党依照这个忠告，正在不倦地力求建立工人阶级的团结并团结一切民族力量和爱国力量。列宁主义的思想鼓舞着各国共产党人为劳动人民的切身利益、为他们祖国的民族独立、为民主和和平而斗争。
    苏联共产党和政府在它们的活动中是以列宁—斯大林关于社会主义制度和资本主义制度的和平共处的可能性的原理为指针的。约·维·斯大林一再指出：苏联是从社会主义和资本主义两种制度不可避免地要共处一个很长的时期这一事实出发，它坚决遵守同一切表示愿意友好合作的国家建立忠实的和和平的关系的方针，只要互相谅解的原则得到遵守，所承担的义务得到履行。苏联共产党和政府坚持不渝地执行和平外交政策，积极地为巩固和平和国际安全而斗争。中华人民共和国和所有欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家正在同苏联一道，为伟大的和平事业而斗争。世界大事证明，美、英、法三国和某些其他国家的统治集团已走上了建立侵略性的军事集团和复活德国军国主义、从而加剧整个国际局势的危险道路。巴黎协定规定使西德重新军国主义化和建立一支由前希特勒将领统率的西德军队。巴黎协定是和国际协议，特别是和法苏同盟互助条约完全矛盾的。
    苏联政府在十二月十六日的照会中指出，批准巴黎协定的行动会勾销法苏同盟互助条约，会使这个条约作废。这种情况的全部责任要由法国、由法国政府来负。
    约·维·斯大林曾着重指出人民群众在揭发和挫败侵略者的阴谋方面所起的决定性作用。一切爱好和平的人民都记得斯大林下面这段有历史意义的话：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中，那么战争就可能变得不可避免。”
    和平战士们正在展开广泛的、全国范围的运动来揭穿美国和追随美国的其他国家的侵略集团的罪恶计划，正在展开反对批准伦敦和巴黎军事协定、反对复活德国军国主义以及复活德国国防军的运动。站在这个争取和平、争取建立集体安全体系的斗争的最前列的是苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家。
    欧洲国家莫斯科会议空前地显示了爱好和平的国家间的团结一致，这次会议是对和平事业的一个伟大贡献。
    列宁和斯大林一再号召爱好和平的人民保持警惕，他们曾着重指出必须加强苏维埃国家和它的武装部队，这样苏维埃国家才不会给人以可乘之隙。西德的重新军国主义化和西方国家变本加厉的侵略活动，将迫使苏联和其他爱好和平的国家不得不采取必要的紧急措施，用它们自己的保卫和维护和平的充分力量和决心来对付成为对和平的威胁的越来越加强的侵略国家的武装部队。要是帝国主义集团胆敢打断民主阵营各国人民的和平生活和发动新战争，那就只能产生一个结果——侵略者的完全失败。
    伟大的马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的事业，和平、民主和社会主义的事业，是不可战胜的！
