    Comprehensive Winter Construction on the Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway's Jining-Eren Section
    Tracks Laid to Twelve Kilometers from Eren Station
    After ample preparation, comprehensive winter construction has been launched on the Jining-Eren section of the Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway. On the snow-covered construction sites, over 17,000 workers are laboring intensely, braving the severe cold of twenty to thirty degrees below zero.
    Based on the experience gained from last year's winter construction, this year's winter construction volume on the Jining-Eren line has tripled. In addition to roadbed, track laying, and bridge and culvert projects, the construction items also include 30,000 square meters of building construction, four reinforced concrete water towers ranging from twenty to thirty meters in height, and the production of over 200,000 pieces of cement tiles, cement beams, and water pipes. Since the start of winter construction, many projects have progressed rapidly. Before the snowfall, the daily track laying progress reached 4.1 kilometers, and in November, in addition to completing the track laying plan, an additional nine kilometers were laid. Labor efficiency for roadbed earthwork and building construction generally reached the winter quota, and some even exceeded the quota. The workers actively overcame the difficulties in winter construction and ensured the quality of the projects. After the temperature dropped to minus twenty degrees, the workers of the third detachment of the construction engineering team used warming pits to mix the mortar, keeping the mortar temperature at around twenty degrees. The workers more widely promoted the advanced experience of Soviet winter construction. This winter, in the construction of roadbeds, houses, water towers, and other projects, in addition to continuing to use the effective advanced experience of "rapid freezing method," "steam curing method," and "heat storage method," the cement product factory also adopted the "electric heating method," which shortened the production time of products such as water pipes from the past twenty-eight days to three days.

    The track laying project of the Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway within our country is about to be completed. The track spiking engineering team is braving the severe cold of over thirty degrees below zero on the Mongolian grasslands, clearing the snow on the roadbed, and advancing non-stop towards Eren Station on the Sino-Mongolian border. On the 2nd, the main line track laying project had crossed the Xilin Station and reached a location only twelve kilometers away from Eren Station.

    集宁—乌兰巴托铁路集二段全面冬季施工
    路轨已铺到离二连车站十二公里的地方
    经过充分准备，集宁—乌兰巴托铁路集宁到二连段已全面展开冬季施工。在白雪皑皑的工地上，有一万七千多工人正冒着零下二三十度的严寒在紧张地劳动着。
    在去年冬季施工获得经验的基础上，今年集二线冬季施工的工程量比去年加大了三倍。施工项目除路基、铺轨、桥涵等以外，还有三万平方公尺的房屋建筑，四座二三十公尺高的钢筋混凝土水塔以及二十多万件水泥瓦、水泥梁、水管等成品的生产。冬季施工开始后，许多工程进展仍然很快。在没有落雪前，每天铺轨进度曾达到四点一公里，十一月份除完成铺轨计划外，还多铺了九公里。路基土石方和房屋建筑的劳动效率一般也都达到冬季定额，有的还超过了定额。工人们积极克服冬季施工中的困难，保证了工程的质量。建筑工程队三分队的工人在气温下降到零下二十度以后，利用暖坑来拌和沙浆，使沙浆温度保持在二十度左右。工人们更广泛地推行了苏联冬季施工的先进经验。今冬在修筑路基、房屋、水塔等工程中，除继续采用行之有效的“迅速冻结法”、“蒸汽养生法”、“蓄热法”等先进经验外，水泥成品厂还采用了“电热法”，使水管等成品的生产时间由过去的二十八天缩短到三天。　（新华社）
    集宁—乌兰巴托铁路在我国境内的铺轨工程快要完工了。钉道工程队正冒着蒙古草原上零下三十多度的严寒，清除路基上的积雪，不停息地向中蒙边境的二连站挺进。二日，正线铺轨工程已越过西林车站，到了距离二连车站只有十二公里的地方。
