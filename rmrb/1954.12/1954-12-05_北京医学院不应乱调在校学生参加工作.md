Letter to the Editor Summary:

    Beijing Medical College Should Not Randomly Transfer Students to Work
    A letter from Gao Quanzhen of Beijing Medical College: I am a fourth-year student in the Department of Medicine at Beijing Medical College. In early September, I and four other students were transferred by the college to participate in work. I spent three weeks without doing any work and was later transferred to work on the college journal.
    I believe that Beijing Medical College should not randomly transfer students to participate in work. The former Ministry of Personnel of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Ministry of Education explicitly stipulated: "In principle, students in school should be allowed to graduate before being assigned work, especially students in science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine departments, and should not be transferred..." The practice of Beijing Medical College is obviously in violation of the above regulations.

专栏：来信摘要

    北京医学院不应乱调在校学生参加工作
    北京医学院高全贞来信：我是北京医学院医学系四年级的学生，九月初，我和其他四位同学都被院方调出参加工作，我待了三个星期也没有一点工作，后来被调去搞院刊工作。
    我认为北京医学院不该随便抽调在校学生参加工作。前中央人民政府人事部、高等教育部、教育部曾明文规定：“在校学生原则上应让其结业后再行分配工作，特别是理、工、农、医各科系学生，不可调用……。”北京医学院的作法，显然是违背上述规定的。
