Guangdong Province is Ready for Afforestation

The Forestry Department of Guangdong Province plans to afforest 2.4 million mu of land and cultivate more than 5,200 mu of seedlings next year. In addition, it will focus on building a 100-kilometer-long shelterbelt in western Guangdong.

Various regions have successively carried out afforestation preparation work. Both eastern and western Guangdong have organized manpower to conduct surveys in various places and assist various regions in building nurseries and collecting tree seeds.

According to statistics from thirty-one counties, they have trained more than 5,500 village cadres and active forestry farmers, using training classes or representative meetings. Under the leadership of the representatives, counties such as Longchuan, Wuhua, Jiaoling, and Pingyuan have all completed the seed collection tasks on time. By the end of November, the province had collected 100,000 jin of pine seeds and more than 50,000 jin of fir seeds.

Currently, farmers in various regions are processing tree seeds; state-owned forestry farms have begun to prepare afforestation land, striving to start sowing before the Spring Festival.

    广东省已做好造林准备工作
    广东省林业厅计划明年全省造林二百四十万亩，育苗五千二百多亩，另在粤西区重点营造防护林带一百公里。
    各地先后进行了造林准备工作，粤东、粤西区都组织了人力，分赴各地进行勘查，并协助各地修建苗圃和采集树种。
    据三十一个县统计，它们采用训练班或代表会的形式，共已训练了乡村干部和林农积极分子五千五百多人。龙川、五华、蕉岭、平远等县在代表的带动下，都按时完成了采种任务。到十一月底止，全省已采集松种十万斤，杉种五万多斤。
    现在各地农民正进行树种的处理工作；国营林场已经开始整理造林地，争取在春节前开始下种。
