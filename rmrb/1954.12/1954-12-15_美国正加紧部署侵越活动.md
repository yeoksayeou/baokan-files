Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A United Press dispatch from Washington on the 11th, quoting US officials, said that the United States will take over the training of the South Vietnamese puppet army from January 1st next year. The United States will provide "aid" directly to the Bao Dai government without going through France, starting at that time. The news revealed the US plan that the United States will directly train the Bao Dai army and establish a corps of officers as soon as possible. The training will be led by General O'Daniel, head of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group in Indochina. Three hundred and seventy-one US officers and soldiers in South Vietnam will participate, holding important training positions. The 4,600 French personnel who have been training the Bao Dai army will continue to help with the training in the initial stage.

According to the US plan, the United States intends to reduce the maintenance costs for the French Expeditionary Force in Indochina next year, from $385 million in 1954 to no more than $100 million.

The news also said that US officials revealed, "France has agreed to relinquish responsibility for training indigenous troops in South Vietnam. However, the French strongly opposed the proposed US aid plan to reduce US dollar spending on France." It is said that Mendès-France has requested to negotiate with the United States on these issues. US Secretary of State Dulles and others, who are about to go to Paris to attend the annual meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, are preparing to hold secret talks with the French government on these issues.

The news revealed that Radford plans to go to Indochina after the Paris talks to meet with US Special Envoy to South Vietnam Collins in order to further deploy US aggressive activities in Indochina.

    美国正加紧部署侵越活动
    预定明年起接手训练南越伪军
    据新华社讯：合众社十一日自华盛顿发出的一条消息援引美国官员的话说：美国将从明年一月一日起接手训练保大军队。美国不通过法国而把“援助”直接给予保大政府，也将从那个时候开始。这条消息透露美国的计划说，美国将直接训练保大军队，并尽早建立一个军官团。训练工作由美国驻印度支那军事援助顾问团团长奥丹尼尔负责。参加者有美国在南越的三百七十一名官兵，他们将担任重要的训练职务。原来一直在训练保大军队的四千六百名法国人在初期将继续帮助训练工作。
    根据美国的计划，美国打算在明年削减对法国在印度支那远征军的维持费，这笔款项将从一九五四年的三亿八千五百万美元减到不超过一亿美元。
    消息还说：美国官员透露，“法国已同意放弃在南越训练土著军队的责任。但是，法国人对于建议中的美国援助计划将削减美国对法国的美元开支的方面表示强烈反对。”据说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯已要求和美国就这些问题进行商谈。即将赴巴黎参加北大西洋公约理事会年会的美国国务卿杜勒斯等正准备和法国政府就这些问题举行秘密会谈。
    消息透露：雷德福打算在巴黎会谈后到印度支那去会见美国驻南越特使柯林斯，以便进一步部署美国在印度支那的侵略活动。
