Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 14th—According to TASS, the European Conference against the Arming of West Germany, for Negotiations on the German Question, and for Disarmament, which opened in Paris on the 11th, closed on the 12th.

    The speeches of the representatives of various countries showed that the people of Western Europe are determined to prevent the resurgence of German militarism.

    Former West German Minister of the Interior, Heinemann, said at the conference: For the German people, keeping Germany permanently divided means an unending cold war. This line of division will run through every family, every group, and sooner or later turn Germany into a battlefield. Heinemann emphasized that the Germans want and need German unification.

    Italian Socialist Party Member of Parliament, Riccardo Lombardi, emphasized that the task of fighting against the Paris Agreements must not be assigned to the French people alone, because the people of other countries, the member states of the future Western European Union, should also be responsible for the consequences of the Paris Agreements.

    Finnish Professor Felix Iversen spoke of the good neighborly relations between Finland and the Soviet Union. He said that if it were not for the blatant interference of the United States in European affairs, Western European countries would be able to live peacefully with the East, and his words won warm applause from all the representatives.

    The representatives listened attentively to the speech of French National Assembly Member, Laurent Casanova. He pointed out that arming West Germany alone would eliminate the possibility of resolving the German question and would exacerbate international tension. He said that the Eastern countries have issued us clear warnings, which should be taken very seriously.

    Casanova emphasized that regardless of the outcome of the upcoming debate in the French National Assembly, the French people have the final say, and they will never succumb to the demand to arm Germany. All those who cherish the national interests of France must unite and take joint action to oppose the revival of German militarism.

    A representative from French universities, Bozzo-Bogo, accused the Paris Agreements of being a policy based on absurdities and the denial of human dignity.

    The Secretary of the British Democratic Control League, Parkin, emphasized that the notorious British "guarantee" is not a serious guarantee.

    Some West German representatives emphasized that the German people do not agree with the resurgence of German militarism. If the Bonn government takes this path, it represents Washington and Dulles, not Germany.

    The conference passed a resolution. The resolution pointed out that the Paris Agreements would seriously affect the future of negotiations. The Paris Agreements are an obstacle to negotiations between East and West on the German question and will push the whole world onto the path of an arms race.

    The representatives attending the conference called on social figures, political leaders, governments, and parliaments of all countries to reject the Paris Agreements and make resolute efforts to ease international tensions.

    The representatives attending the conference also decided to send a delegation to hold a meeting with the representatives of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies who were unable to attend the conference because France refused to issue them entry visas.

    巴黎欧洲会议号召拒绝巴黎协定
      【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：十一日在巴黎开幕的反对武装西德、争取就德国问题举行谈判和争取裁减军备的欧洲会议，已经在十二日闭幕。
    各国代表的发言表明：西欧各国人民决心阻止德国军国主义复活。
    前波恩政府内政部长海涅曼在会上说：对德国人民来说，使德国永远处于分裂状态就意味着没有完的冷战。这条分裂线会穿过每一个家庭，每一个集团，而且迟早会把德国变成战场。海涅曼强调指出：德国人希望而且需要德国统一。
    意大利的社会党议员理卡多·龙巴迪强调指出：为反对巴黎协定而斗争的任务绝不能只派给法国人民，因为，其他国家的人民，未来的西欧联盟的成员国的人民，也应当对巴黎协定的后果负责。
    芬兰的费利克斯·伊维尔逊教授讲到了芬兰和苏联之间的善邻关系。他说，如果不是美国明目张胆地干涉欧洲事务的话，西欧国家是能够同东方和平相处的，他的话赢得了所有代表的热烈的掌声。
    代表们聚精会神地听取了法国国民议会议员洛朗·加桑诺瓦的发言。他指出：单独武装西德会勾销解决德国问题的可能性，而且会使国际紧张局势加剧。他说：东方国家已经向我们发出了明确的警告，应该十分认真看待这种警告。
    加桑诺瓦强调指出：不管法国国民议会快要举行的辩论的结果如何，法国人民有最后的发言权，他们绝不会屈从武装德国的要求。所有珍视法国民族利益的人必须团结起来，采取联合行动来反对德国军国主义的复活。
    法国大学方面的代表波佐·波哥指责巴黎协定是一种以荒唐的东西和否认人类尊严的做法为基础的政策。
    英国民主监督联盟的书记帕金强调指出：臭名远扬的英国“保证”并不是什么认真的保证。
    一些西德代表强调指出：德国人民不同意德国军国主义复活。波恩政府如果走这条路，它就是代表华盛顿和杜勒斯，而不是代表德国。
    会议通过了一个决议。决议指出：巴黎协定会严重地影响到谈判的前途。巴黎协定是东西方就德国问题进行谈判的障碍，而且会把全世界推上军备竞赛的道路。
    出席会议的代表要求各国的社会人士、政界领袖、政府和议会拒绝巴黎协定，并且为缓和国际紧张局势而坚决努力。
    出席会议的代表还决定派出一个代表团，去同那些因为法国拒发入境签证而没有能够出席会议的苏联和人民民主国家的代表举行一次会议。
