    Suining Two Districts' Health Centers and Agricultural Cooperatives
    Sign Medical Prevention and Healthcare Contracts

    The health centers of the Seventh and Ninth Districts of Suining County, Sichuan Province, have signed "Medical Prevention and Healthcare Contracts" with the Xinsheng and Shengli agricultural production cooperatives respectively. The contracts stipulate that the district health centers will send personnel to the cooperatives for treatment for three days each month, and inspect the hygiene of the cooperatives and the health of the members. In case of emergency, doctors will be available upon request without charging consultation fees; diseases that cannot be treated locally will be referred to hospitals by the district health center. The cooperatives that have signed contracts enjoy priority in terms of prevention and healthcare; regular prenatal check-ups are provided for pregnant women to ensure safe delivery; first-aid medicines are supplied during the busy farming season. Medical and health knowledge is explained to the members on a regular monthly basis. Diagnosis and treatment costs are settled uniformly by the cooperative on a regular basis.
    Before the contracts were signed, they were fully discussed by all members of the cooperatives. The health centers absorbed local Chinese and Western medicine practitioners to participate in the signing of the contracts.
    The contracts have been implemented well. In the past three months, 144 patients from the Xinsheng agricultural production cooperative have received treatment at the district health center's outpatient department, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of illnesses in the cooperative. Eight pregnant women had prenatal check-ups, and six deliveries were performed. During the autumn harvest, the health center sent people with first-aid kits and helped the cooperative establish a busy-season nursery to guide women in taking care of their children. Health workers selected within the cooperative regularly inspect and improve the cooperative's housing and environmental hygiene according to the doctor's advice. In the Shengli agricultural production cooperative, 25 patients have been cured in just over a month. This has improved the past situation where some diseases could not be prevented in advance and could not be treated in time after the fact due to the remote location. As a result, the members are very satisfied.
    The county health section is now planning to promote this type of "Medical Prevention and Healthcare Contract" throughout the county.

    遂宁两个区卫生所和农业合作社
    签订医疗预防保健合同
    四川遂宁县七区和九区的卫生所，分别和新胜、胜利两个农业生产合作社签订了“医疗预防保健合同”。合同规定：区卫生所每月派人到社内治疗三天，并检查社内卫生和社员身体健康情况。发生急症时，大夫随请随到，不收出诊费；当地不能治疗的疾病，由区卫生所负责送到医院。在预防保健方面，签订合同的社享有优先的权利；对妊妇作定期产前检查，保证安全分娩；农忙季节，供给急救药品。每月定期向社员讲解医药卫生常识。诊疗费用，由合作社按期统一结算。
    合同签订前，曾经过全体社员的充分讨论。卫生所吸收了当地中、西医生参加签订合同。
    合同执行情况很好。新胜农业生产合作社三个月来，到区卫生所门诊部治疗的有一百四十四个病人次，占全社发病人数百分之七十以上。八个妊妇作了产前检查，接生六个。秋收的时候，卫生所派人带来急救药箱，并帮助社员建立了农忙托儿所，指导妇女带娃娃。社内选出卫生员按照医生的意见，经常检查和改善社内住家和环境卫生。胜利农业生产合作社在一个多月内，已有二十五个病人被医治好了。使过去那种因为地区偏僻，有的病不能事先预防，事后不能及时治疗的现象得到改善。因而社员们非常满意。
    现在县卫生科正计划在全县内推广这种“医疗预防保健合同”。
