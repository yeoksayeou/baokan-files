Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The French National Assembly continued its debate on the Paris Agreements on the afternoon of the 22nd.

    People's Republican Movement (MRP) faction leader Deixonne stated: The MRP will not vote in favor of the Paris Agreements, even though the MRP was the most active supporter of the "European Defence Community" treaty, the precursor to the Paris Agreements. Sources say that many parliamentarians, seeing the vigorously developing popular movement against the rearmament of West Germany, are now considering abstaining to avoid the responsibility for allowing the Paris Agreements to be ratified.

    Socialist Party parliamentarian Le Bail stated in his speech that he would vote in favor of the Paris Agreements, although, according to his constituency's newspaper, he had received a letter warning him not to vote in favor.

    Social Republican faction leader Palewski then spoke. He admitted that ratifying the Paris Agreements would damage the chances of reaching international agreements. He criticized the argument put forward by supporters of the Paris Agreements that negotiations should be conducted "from a position of strength," and said, "Experience shows that the action of arming Germany, even if subject to temporary restrictions, cannot but be fraught with danger." Despite this, Palewski, in concluding his speech, defended a proposed amendment to postpone the entry into force of the Paris Agreements until December 1, 1955.

    Independent Republican parliamentarian and former Prime Minister Reynaud then spoke. Reynaud had previously supported the "European Defence Community." Now he said: Supporters of the "European Defence Community" cannot vote in favor of the Paris Agreements. He criticized that France did not receive the same treatment as Britain in the Paris Agreements; Britain controlled France, and France did not control Britain. He also said: The Paris Agreements would establish British "political hegemony" and West German "military hegemony" in Europe. But he also stated that he would not vote against these agreements.

    The last speaker at the afternoon session was Radical Socialist parliamentarian Daladier. He said that he would vote against the Paris Agreements. He said that people, after carefully reading the recent Soviet notes, could not but conclude that ratifying the Paris Agreements would exacerbate international tensions.

    Daladier pointed out the danger of restoring the Ruhr military industry and the danger of producing atomic weapons in West Germany. He pointed out that in West Germany, the movement against remilitarization is growing. He emphasized: "I would rather have an alliance with German youth, trade unionists, and social democrats than an alliance with Ruhr tycoons and war criminals." Daladier refuted the cliché about the "Soviet threat," saying: The plan to restore German militarism was drawn up when international tensions had seen a definite easing. After the rejection of the European Defence Community, the Soviet Union had suggested discussing a plan to control the armaments of East and West Germany. Why was this suggestion not agreed to?

    Daladier continued: If France refuses to ratify the Paris Agreements, and the United States unilaterally arms Germany, this is an act of "bad faith" and a "betrayal" of international obligations. Daladier finally said that it is impossible to arm Germany without French participation.

Xinhua News Agency, dispatch dated December 24th: TASS Paris, December 24th: The National Assembly continued its debate on the Paris Agreements at the morning session on December 23rd. After People's Republican Movement parliamentarian Abelin announced that the People's Republican Movement parliamentary group would not vote in favor of ratifying the Paris Agreements, Communist parliamentarian Musmeaux spoke next. Musmeaux pointed out that French society is deeply concerned about the threats contained in the Paris Agreements to arm West Germany. He said: Communist parliamentarians will vote against ratifying the Paris Agreements entirely in accordance with the wishes of the people.

    Independent Republican parliamentarian Pierre André's speech took up a considerable amount of time in the session. He declared his loyalty to the North Atlantic Alliance and brutally attacked the Soviet Union, attempting to blame the Western countries' decision to take the path of arming Germany on the Soviet Union. However, he had to admit that "whether from a military or a political point of view," the revival of German militarism was "illegitimate." He said: Arming West Germany is inappropriate under the current conditions, and therefore ratifying the Paris Agreements is a bad "Christmas present" for the German people.

    André talked about the revanchist plans of the Bonn government and reminded that it was German militarism that had invaded Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, and the Soviet Union in the past. He demanded the signing of a peace treaty with Germany, while emphasizing: It is unprecedented that someone wishes to arm a defeated country before signing a peace treaty with it.

    The National Assembly then adjourned until 16:00 local time. On a motion by Prime Minister Mendès-France, the chairmen of the parliamentary groups of all parties except the Communist Party in the National Assembly were notified to hold a meeting at 15:00. People in the parliament lounge pointed out that the purpose of this meeting was to reach a deal on the vote that was about to take place.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The French National Assembly continued its debate on the Paris Agreements on the afternoon of the 23rd in a tense atmosphere.

    Parliamentarian Badie proposed a motion after the afternoon session resumed, requesting a postponement of the ratification of the Saar Agreement until the French government reached an understanding with the Bonn government on the interpretation of the Franco-German agreement on the Saar. Since the government had submitted the entire set of Paris Agreements for ratification, the passage of Badie's motion would mean a postponement of the ratification of the entire set of Paris Agreements.

    Mendès-France immediately stood up and said that the government intended to raise a question of confidence, opposing any "preconditions" or motions for postponement and any other supplementary clauses, and suggested that the National Assembly immediately examine item by item the bills submitted by the government requesting ratification of the Paris Agreements. Mendès-France also suggested that the National Assembly vote on the motion of confidence on the afternoon of the 24th, and that the parliament continue the debate before voting on the motion of confidence.

    Mendès-France's statement aroused strong opposition from the parliamentarians, who decided not to immediately raise the question of confidence, and expressed regret at this situation, because, as he admitted, he was eager to let "foreign countries concerned about the outcome of these debates know the evolution of the discussion – at least from the preliminary vote." Since Mendès-France was unable to exert his means, he said that the discussion would continue "all night and part of the next day" so that the vote on the issue of ratification could take place as soon as possible.

    After the discussion continued, Robert Schuman (People's Republican Movement) rose to speak. Although Schuman's speech was very implicit, it was clear that, in his view, the final vote on the Paris Agreements was not an easy matter, because the National Assembly must not only decide the German issue, but also the issue of relations with the East. Schuman went on to say that the issue of security is not only a problem facing us, but also a problem facing the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union also has the right to enjoy security. It is precisely this issue that must be negotiated at future meetings. However, Schuman did not miss the opportunity to demand evidence of so-called "sincerity" from the Soviet side.

    Parliamentarians listened carefully to the speech of the Honorary Speaker of the National Assembly, Édouard Herriot, who spoke from his seat due to health reasons.

    He said: I cannot vote in favor of the Paris Agreements. This agreement will cause us to lose the benefits we have gained under international agreements, especially the Potsdam decisions. He said: Existing simultaneously with a reactionary, revenge-seeking Germany is another Germany composed of youth, trade unions, and social democrats. As a Frenchman and a Republican, I cannot understand why France should help reactionary Germany. He said: Like you, I cannot forget our many dead brothers, who taught us to remember their fate.

    The unresolved Saar issue is another reason why Herriot does not support the Paris Agreements. According to him, the third reason is that the Paris Agreements will force France and the world to intensify the movement to expand armaments at a time when disarmament issues have already made some progress in the United Nations.

    Mendès-France then spoke, his speech entirely defending the Paris Agreements. He asked the parliamentarians to vote in favor of ratifying these agreements, just as they had voted in favor of France's position at the London Conference two months ago. Speaking of the Saar issue, Mendès-France rejected the amendment proposed by Radical Socialist parliamentarian Badie, saying that the agreement on the Saar issue and the Paris Agreements on arming West Germany were a single whole. Mendès-France spoke at length about the "guarantees" of the United States and Britain on the Saar Statute.

    Mendès-France admitted that France had suffered a lot from German militarism, while at the same time putting forward the old cliché that West Germany would arm itself even without French participation, which aroused dissatisfaction among many parliamentarians.

    In replying to supporters of the "European Defence Community" who criticized the Paris Agreements, the head of government admitted that there was not much military difference between the two plans.

    法国国民议会关于巴黎协定辩论的情况
    据新华社讯：法国国民议会二十二日下午继续举行关于巴黎协定的辩论。
    人民共和党党团主席戴尚表示：人民共和党将不投票赞成巴黎协定，虽然人民共和党原是巴黎协定的前身“欧洲防务集团”条约的最积极的支持者。有消息说，不少议员看到蓬勃发展的反对重新武装西德的人民运动，现在正在考虑用弃权的办法来规避他们让巴黎协定得到批准而应负的责任。
    社会党议员勒巴伊在发言中表示他将投票赞成巴黎协定，虽然，据他选区的报纸说，他曾接到过一封警告他不要投赞成票的信。
    社会共和党党团主席巴列夫斯基接着发言。他承认批准巴黎协定将损害求得国际协议的机会。他抨击拥护巴黎协定的人所提出的“以实力为后盾”进行谈判的主张，并且说，“经验表明，武装德国的行动即使受到暂时的限制，也不能不充满着危险。”虽然这样，巴列夫斯基在结束他的发言时，还是为一项主张使巴黎协定生效期推迟到一九五五年十二月一日开始的修正建议作了辩护。
    独立共和党议员、前总理雷诺接着发言。雷诺是曾经支持“欧洲防务集团”的。现在他说：赞成
  “欧洲防务集团”的人不能投票赞成巴黎协定。他抨击说：在巴黎协定中法国没有得到和英国同等的待遇；英国控制了法国，法国并没有控制英国。他并且说：巴黎协定将在欧洲建立英国的“政治霸权”和西德的“军事霸权”。但他又表示他将不投票反对这些协定。
    下午会议上最后一个发言的是激进社会党议员达拉第。他说，他将投票反对巴黎协定，他说，人们在仔细读过苏联最近发出的照会以后，不能不得出这样的结论：批准巴黎协定将会使国际紧张局势加剧。
    达拉第指出恢复鲁尔军事工业的危险和在西德生产原子武器的危险。他指出，在西德，反对重新军国主义化的运动在日益高涨。他强调指出：“我宁愿要的是同德国青年、工会工作者和社会民主党人结成的联盟，而不愿要同鲁尔大亨和战犯结成的联盟。”达拉第驳斥了关于“苏联威胁”的滥调，他说：恢复德国军国主义的计划是在国际紧张局势有了肯定的缓和的时候拟订的。在欧洲防务集团遭到拒绝以后，苏联曾经建议讨论一项管制东德和西德的军备的计划。为什么不同意这个建议呢？
    达拉第继续说：假使法国拒绝批准巴黎协定，而美国还片面武装德国的话，这是“违反”国际义务的“背信弃义”的行为。达拉第最后说，没有法国参加，是不可能武装德国的。
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十四日讯：国民议会在十二月二十三日上午会议上继续就巴黎协定进行辩论。在人民共和党议员阿拜林宣布人民共和党议会党团不会投票赞成批准巴黎协定之后，共产党议员缪斯摩接着发言。缪斯摩指出：法国社会人士对批准武装西德的巴黎协定包含的威胁深感不安。他说：共产党议员们会完全依据人民的愿望，投票反对批准巴黎协定。
    独立共和党议员皮埃尔·安德烈的发言占了会议的相当多的时间，他宣布他忠于北大西洋联盟，并且粗暴地攻击苏联，企图把西方国家决定走武装德国的道路归罪于苏联。可是他不得不承认，“不论从军事观点还是从政治观点来看”，复活德国军国主义都是“不正当的”。他说：在目前条件下武装西德是不适宜的，因此批准巴黎协定对德国人民来说，是一件不好的“圣诞节礼物”。
    安德烈谈到波恩政府的复仇主义计划，并且提醒说，过去侵略了奥地利、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、法国和苏联的正是德国军国主义。他要求和德国签订和约，同时强调：有人希望在和一个战败国签订和约之前先把它武装起来，这是史无前例的。
    接着国民议会休会到当地时间十六时。根据孟戴斯—弗朗斯总理的动议，国民议会中除共产党以外各政党的议会党团主席被通知在十五时举行会议。议会休息室人士指出：这次会议的目的，是要就马上要举行的表决达成一项交易。
    据新华社讯：法国国民议会二十三日下午四时在紧张气氛中继续举行关于巴黎协定的辩论。
    议员巴迪在下午复会后提出了一项动议，要求在法国政府同波恩政府就法德关于萨尔的协议的解释问题达成谅解之前，延期批准萨尔协议。由于政府已经把整套巴黎协定提请批准，如果通过巴迪的动议，就意味着延期批准整套巴黎协定。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯马上站起来说，政府打算提出信任问题，反对任何“先决问题”或延期的动议和任何别的补充条款，并且建议国民议会立即逐项审查政府要求批准巴黎协定的法案。孟戴斯—弗朗斯并且建议国民议会在二十四日下午表决信任动议，而在表决信任动议之前，议会继续辩论。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯的声明引起了议员的激烈的反对，决定不立即提出信任问题，而表示对这种情况感到遗憾，因为如他所承认的那样，他急于让“关心这些辩论的结果的外国知道讨论的演变——至少从初步表决知道这种演变”。由于孟戴斯—弗朗斯没有能够施展他的手段，他说讨论将在“整夜和第二天一部分时间”继续进行，以便关于批准问题的表决能够尽快进行。
    在讨论继续进行以后，罗伯·舒曼（人民共和党）起立发言。舒曼的发言虽然非常含蓄，但是很显然，据他看来，关于巴黎协定的最后表决不是一件容易的事，因为国民议会不但必须决定德国问题，而且还要决定同东方的关系的问题。舒曼接着说，安全问题不但是我们、而且也是苏联面临的问题，苏联同样有着享受安全的权利。正是这个问题必须在将来的会议上进行谈判。可是，舒曼并没有放过机会来要求所谓苏联方面的“诚意”的证据。
    议员们仔细听取了国民议会荣誉议长爱德华·赫里欧的发言，由于健康关系，他在自己的座位上发言。
    他说：我不能够投票赞成巴黎协定。这个协定将使我们丧失我们根据国际协议，特别是波茨坦决定取得的利益。他说：同一个反动的、追求复仇的德国同时存在的，是另一个由青年、工会和社会民主党人组成的德国。作为一个法国人和一个共和主义者，我无法了解法国为什么应当去援助反动的德国。他说：同你们一样，我不能够忘记我们的许多死难弟兄，他们教我们记起了他们的命运。
    萨尔问题没有解决是赫里欧不支持巴黎协定的另外一个理由。据他说，第三个理由就是巴黎协定将迫使法国和全世界在裁军问题已经在联合国获得某种程度进展的时候，加紧扩充军备的运动。
    接着孟戴斯—弗朗斯发言，他的演说完全是为巴黎协定辩解。他要求议员们投票赞成批准这些协定，正像他们在两个月以前投票赞成法国在伦敦会议上的立场一样。在谈到萨尔问题时，孟戴斯—弗朗斯拒绝了激进社会党议员巴迪所提出来的修正案，他说，关于萨尔问题的协定和关于武装西德的巴黎协定是一个单一的整体。孟戴斯—弗朗斯在关于美国和英国对萨尔法规的“保证”上谈了很久。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯承认法国曾经从德国军国主义那里吃到过不少苦头，同时却又提出老一套的说法，硬说在没有法国参加的情况下西德也会武装起来，这番话引起了许多议员的不满。
    这位政府首脑在答覆批评巴黎协定的“欧洲防务集团”的支持者时，承认这两个计划之间在军事上是没有什么很大的不同的。
