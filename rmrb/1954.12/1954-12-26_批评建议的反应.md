Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    Regarding Errors in Handling Scattered Timber

    Tie Feng, Acting Director of the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory, writes: The criticism raised on the "Letters from Readers" page on November 21 regarding the improper handling of scattered timber in our factory is correct. In handling scattered timber, we were exploited by private merchants, causing the state a loss of more than 4.5 billion yuan and creating adverse political effects. The reasons for this error are, first, that we did not earnestly implement the state's timber management methods and were not responsible enough for state property, thus erroneously entrusting private merchants to manufacture furniture, offsetting timber against processing fees, hardware accessory fees, and transportation costs. Second, when signing contracts with private merchants, we relaxed our vigilance against the "five poisons" of illegal capitalists and failed to pay attention to the corruption, malfeasance, and dereliction of duty of individual cadres. We neither thoroughly understood the market situation nor invited experienced workers to participate in the estimation of work and materials but simply approved matters casually. I should bear the primary responsibility for these errors. In addition to reporting to the leading organs for appropriate punishment, I am determined to earnestly study policies and change my work style in the future. Furthermore, the factory has also decided to take measures to improve timber utilization and improve the timber management system to make full use of state timber.

    Learning from the Lesson of Blindly Felling Timber

    The Gannan Branch of the Jiangxi Forest Industry Bureau writes: The criticism raised on the "Letters from Readers" page on November 21 regarding our bureau's Shicheng Work Team blindly mobilizing the masses to fell timber in Ninghua County, Fujian, resulting in a large backlog of timber without buyers, is entirely correct. This phenomenon also exists in other areas of Gannan. The main reason for this error is that some cadres have a simplistic task-oriented viewpoint, failing to mobilize and organize the masses to fell timber according to plan, especially since we did not promptly notify the local government of the purchase plan, resulting in the masses felling too much timber, and our purchase plan could not meet the needs of the masses. In addition, some of the masses do not have a sufficient understanding of the socialist future and fear that socialist forests will become public property, leading to the erroneous view that "it is better to fell timber sooner rather than later," which is also a reason for the blind felling of timber.

    Regarding the issue of excessive timber stockpiles among the masses, we have instructed the Shicheng Work Team to purchase timber from them in a planned way and on a case-by-case basis.

    Substandard Agricultural Tools Will Never Leave the Factory

    In September, Li Chunzhi of the Zhaodong County Cooperative United Society in Heilongjiang wrote a letter reflecting that the harvesters allocated to the Zhaodong County United Society by the Heilongjiang Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative were rusted, affecting their supply business and creating a negative impact among the farmers. This newspaper immediately asked the Heilongjiang Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative to investigate and handle the matter. They have accepted Li Chunzhi's opinion and immediately instructed the resident factory staff stationed at the agricultural tool factory to strengthen inspection work. Every machine, every part, and every package is inspected. Rusty and substandard agricultural tools will never leave the factory, resolutely reversing the tendency to emphasize quantity over quality in the supply of agricultural tools.

    Preventing the Recurrence of Stockpiled Materials

    The State-owned Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory writes: Wang Chongren's criticism of our factory's stockpiling of bare copper stranded wire, published on the "Letters from Readers" page on November 21, is in line with the facts. The reason for this stockpiling phenomenon is that after the completion of our factory's capital construction work, we did not conscientiously clear the stockpiled materials in the warehouse, resulting in more than 9,700 kilograms of purple copper wire being stockpiled from 1952 until now, preventing many factories and mines in urgent need of this important material from receiving timely supply. Our factory has made a serious criticism of this issue in conjunction with the factory-wide inspection work in November and has properly disposed of this batch of materials. In the future, we are determined to strengthen our sense of responsibility for cherishing state property and improve our planning and management work to eliminate similar phenomena.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    关于处理零星木材的错误
    四方机车车辆制造工厂代理厂长铁峰来信：十一月二十一日“读者来信专页”对我厂处理零星木材不当问题提出的批评是正确的。我们在处理零星木材时被私商钻了空子，使国家受到了四十五亿多元的损失，并在政治上造成了不良的影响。产生这个错误的原因，首先是对国家管理木材的办法没有认真执行，对国家资财不够认真负责，因而错误地委托私商制造家具，而将木材顶加工费、五金配件费和运费等。其次是在和私商签订合同时，对不法资本家的“五毒”行为放松了警惕，对个别干部贪污、舞弊和失职的行为也未加注意，既不深入了解市场情况，也没有请有经验的职工参加估工估料工作，而随便批准了事。对于这些错误，我应当负主要责任。我除了报请领导机关给以应得的处分外，今后决心认真研究政策，改变工作作风。此外厂里也已决定采取措施，来提高木材利用率和健全木材管理制度，以充分利用国家木材。
    接受盲目砍伐木材的教训
    江西森林工业局赣南分局来信：十一月二十一日“读者来信专页”对我局石城作业队在福建宁化县盲目发动群众砍伐木材，致使大批木材积压无人收购提出的批评，是十分正确的。这种现象在赣南其他地区也同样存在。造成这种错误的主要原因是，某些干部存在着单纯任务观点，没有按照计划动员和组织群众砍伐木材，特别是由于我们没有及时把收购计划通知当地政府，造成群众砍伐木材过多，我们的收购计划不能满足群众的要求。此外，部分群众对社会主义远景认识不足，怕到社会主义山林归公，产生“迟砍不如早砍”的错误看法，这也是造成盲目砍伐木材的一个原因。
    对于群众存材过多的问题，我们已布置石城作业队分别对象有计划地收购。
    不合规格的农具决不出厂
    九月份，黑龙江肇东县合作社联合社李纯志来信，反映从黑龙江省供销合作社调拨到肇东县联社的收割机生了锈，影响到他们供应业务的开展，并在农民中造成不良影响。本报当即请黑龙江省供销合作社检查处理。他们已经接受李纯志的意见立即指示驻在农具制造厂的驻厂员，加强检验工作，每台、每件、每包都加以检验，有锈的、不合规格的农具决不出厂，坚决扭转在农具供应工作上的重量不重质的偏向。
    防止积压物资的现象继续发生
    国营西北第二棉纺织厂来信：十一月二十一日“读者来信专页”所刊王崇仁对我厂积压裸铜绞线的批评是符合事实的。这种积压现象之所以产生，是由于我厂在基本建设工作结束以后，没有认真地清理仓库积压物资，以致九千七百多斤紫铜线从一九五二年积压到现在，使很多急需这种重要物资的工矿不能得到及时供应。我厂对这个问题已结合全厂十一月份的检查工作作了严肃的批判，并把这批物资作了适当处理。今后我们决心要加强爱护国家财富的责任心和计划管理工作，以消除类似现象。
