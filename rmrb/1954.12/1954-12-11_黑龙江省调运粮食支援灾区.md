　　Heilongjiang Province Transfers Grain to Support Disaster Areas
　　The grain departments of Heilongjiang Province are transporting large quantities of grain to Anhui, Hebei, Jiangsu, and other places to support the people in disaster areas in their production and self-reliance. After receiving the task of transferring grain, the grain departments in various places actively sun-dried the grain, adjusted the allocation of sacks and other transportation packaging tools, and hastened the transportation. The Tailai County Grain Depot completed the transfer of 3,100 tons of sorghum in ten days; the Yian and other county grain depots completed the entire month's transfer plan before November 20th. Since the start of this year's grain purchase work, more than 28,000 tons of grain have been transported to the interior of the country by the end of November. Currently, employees of grain departments in various places are stepping up transportation, striving to complete the December grain transportation task ten days ahead of schedule.

    黑龙江省调运粮食支援灾区
    黑龙江省粮食部门把大批粮食运往安徽、河北、江苏等地，支援灾区人民生产自救。各地粮食部门在接到调运粮食的任务以后，都积极翻晒粮食，调剂麻袋等运输包装工具，赶紧运输。泰来县粮栈十天就完成了三千一百吨高粱的调运任务；依安等县粮栈在十一月二十日以前就完成了全月调运计划。从今年粮食征购工作开始以来，到十一月底，全省已经把二万八千多吨粮食运入关内。现在，各地粮食部门的职工正在加紧运输，争取提前十天完成十二月份的运粮任务。　（侯文杰　潘有才）
