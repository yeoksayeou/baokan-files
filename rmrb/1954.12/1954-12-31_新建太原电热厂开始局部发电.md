    New Taiyuan Power and Heating Plant Begins Partial Power Generation
    [This newspaper, Taiyuan, 30th dispatch] On the night of December 28th, the newly built Taiyuan Power and Heating Plant began partial power generation, sending out a powerful current for the first time. That night, the factory was very quiet, wisps of white smoke slowly rising towards the sky, the four large characters "1954" carved on the side of the main building flashing in the night sky. The employees of the Taiyuan Power and Heating Plant conducted a final inspection of the generator equipment, waiting for the official start-up. At about 9 o'clock, the turbine began to make a steady rotation sound, and the workers nervously watched the pointer slowly swinging on the instrument panel. At 11:29, the chief duty officer reported to the chief engineer on the phone: the current has been sent out of the factory. At this time, the substations in the Taiyuan power grid also received an order from the central dispatching room: to start accepting the new current. This powerful current merged into the power grid of the Taiyuan area and began to be transported to various factories and basic construction sites to meet the needs of new users. On the afternoon of the 29th, the director of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant announced to the employees of the electric furnace steelmaking department: the new electric furnace will start production on the 30th. After this batch of electric furnace steelmaking equipment is put into production, the high-quality steel produced next year will be three times the actual output this year.
    The Taiyuan Power and Heating Plant began construction in October 1953 with direct assistance from the Soviet Union. The Soviet government not only designed the factory for us and supplied us with the latest 1953 turbine generators, but also sent more than 20 experts to the site to guide the construction, so that the power plant grew rapidly. This new type of thermal power plant is very large in scale. After the equipment that has started generating electricity this time reaches the quota standard, the amount of electricity generated will be equivalent to one-third of the existing electricity in the Taiyuan area.

    新建太原电热厂开始局部发电
    【本报太原三十日电】十二月二十八日深夜，新建太原电热厂开始局部发电，首次送出了强大的电流。这天夜里，工厂里显得非常肃静，一缕缕的白烟缓缓冲向天空，主厂房顶侧刻着的一九五四四个大字在夜空中闪烁。太原电热厂的职工对发电机设备进行了最后一次检查，等待着正式起动。九时许，汽轮机开始发出了均匀的转动声音，工人们紧张地注视着仪表上徐徐摆动着的指针。十一时二十九分，总值班长在电话上向总工程师报告说：电流已经送出厂外了。这时，太原电力网内的各变电所，也接到总调度室的命令：开始接受新电流。这一股强大的电流并入太原地区的电力网，开始输送到各工厂和基本建设工地去，以满足新用户的需要。二十九日下午，太原钢铁厂厂长向电炉炼钢部的职工宣布说：三十日新建电炉就要开炉生产，这批电炉炼钢设备投入生产后，明年炼出的优质钢将等于今年实际产量的三倍。
    太原电热厂是一九五三年十月在苏联直接帮助下开始兴建的。苏联政府不仅替我们做好工厂设计，供给我们一九五三年最新出品的汽轮发电机，还派了二十多位专家来现场指导施工，使电厂迅速地成长起来。这座新型的火力发电厂规模很大，仅这次开始发电的设备负荷达到定额标准以后，发出的电量就相当于太原地区现有电力的三分之一。
