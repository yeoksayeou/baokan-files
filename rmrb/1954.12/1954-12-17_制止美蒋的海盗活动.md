    Stop the Pirate Activities of the US-Chiang Clique
    Hu Sisheng

    On September 30th and October 18th of this year, the head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations twice wrote to the President of the United Nations General Assembly, requesting that the case of "infringement on freedom of navigation on the Chinese seas" be included in the UN General Assembly agenda. The Soviet delegation clearly pointed out at the time: "In view of the fact that the issue raised by the Soviet delegation is not merely a matter of individual merchant ships being attacked on the high seas, but a crime involving a consistent and serious violation of the recognized principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas," it therefore requested that it be "included in the agenda of the ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly as an important and urgent issue."

    However, the US aggressor clique, with a guilty conscience, was extremely afraid of discussing this motion. It first manipulated the General Assembly to postpone the discussion of including this motion in the agenda, and after the General Assembly included this issue in the agenda, it attempted to prevent the General Assembly from seriously discussing this motion and end it hastily. Now, with the firm efforts of the Soviet Union and other representatives upholding justice, the Special Political Committee of the General Assembly officially began discussing the "infringement on freedom of navigation on the Chinese seas" case on the 13th.

    The Soviet delegation's firm insistence on considering this motion as an important and urgent issue is completely justified. As everyone knows, for several years, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's naval and air forces, with the support of the US naval and air forces, have unscrupulously harassed our coastal shipping and foreign trade, robbed and intercepted our country's and countries trading with our country's merchant ships, and subjected the victimized crew members to violent means such as massacre, torture, and persecution. According to incomplete statistics, more than 470 various Chinese ships have been victimized in recent years. In terms of foreign ships, according to incomplete statistics, from September 1949 to October 1954, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique carried out 111 interceptions, robberies, bombardments, or strafing attacks on 67 merchant ships of various countries in the Chinese coastal and high seas. Among them, British merchant ships suffered the most, totaling 43 ships and 86 times, and there were incidents of British captains being killed and British crew members being injured. Panamanian merchant ships suffered 14 ships, totaling 15 times. Polish and Greek merchant ships suffered two ships each, totaling four times. Soviet, Norwegian, West German, Dutch, Danish, and Italian ships suffered one ship each, totaling six times. Recently, on November 13th, 14th, 22nd, and 28th, British merchant ships "Yee Long," "Hua Li," two Japanese fishing boats, and a Danish cargo ship were attacked by Chiang bandit warships respectively, and the Japanese fishing boats were sunk.

    It can be seen that the Chiang bandits' pirate behavior under the protection of the United States has reached such an unbridled level, practically no different from the robbery and looting of people and goods by medieval pirates. This has completely undermined the tradition of inviolable navigation on the high seas, seriously damaged the interests of various shipping countries, hindered the development of normal trade relations between countries, and created a tense situation in the Far Eastern seas, thus arousing widespread anger and anxiety among public opinion in various countries. The Soviet government and the Polish government have successively sent notes to the United States several times, lodging strong protests against the piracy of US-Chiang interception of Soviet and Polish merchant ships. The anger of the British public is also frequently reflected in the British Parliament. Just recently, on November 24th, some British Labour Party members of Parliament also raised several questions to Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons regarding the piratical actions taken by Kuomintang warships against British merchant ships in Chinese seas. According to Reuters, Eden, in answering these questions, said that Britain had protested to the "Chinese Nationalist authorities" about the detention of two British merchant ships earlier this month by warships based in Taiwan. According to the Press Association, Labour MP Davies asked Eden to "protest to the relevant parties who know that every pirate ship owned by Chiang Kai-shek is actually an American ship."

    Indeed, as Labour MP Davies pointed out, every pirate ship owned by Chiang Kai-shek is actually an American ship. Everyone knows that the US Seventh Fleet, under the orders of the US government, controls the high seas near Taiwan and infringes on our country's territorial waters and airspace. As for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, it relies on US funding to survive, and the weapons, warships, aircraft, and ammunition of the Chiang bandit army are all equipped and supplied by the United States and are under the command of the Pentagon. Without the support of US bayonets, Chiang Kai-shek cannot survive, let alone dare to be so rampant. In fact, in every pirate activity of the Chiang bandits, the US naval and air forces are direct participants.

    A France-Presse dispatch of September 26th this year pointed out: "In the past three years, whenever a British merchant ship appears in the Taiwan Strait, it is monitored by a reconnaissance aircraft of the US Seventh Fleet, and this aircraft reports to the Kuomintang fleet. The Kuomintang sends gunboats to intercept the merchant ship." American "Daily Mirror" columnist Drew Pearson also admitted that before the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" was detained, the United States sent a naval seaplane to circle over it for a long time, "This aircraft maintained direct contact with the Chinese Kuomintang and notified them where to find the Soviet oil tanker."

    According to Kyodo News Agency, on November 22nd, the Japanese fishing boats "Yamada Maru" No. 31 and No. 32 were sunk by US-made ships in the high seas near Dachen Island. At the same time, according to "Asahi Shimbun," the rescued Japanese crew members said that they had seen a US destroyer patrolling near the bombing site. According to Reuters, Captain Bielt Flinming of the Danish cargo ship "Emilie Maersk" said on November 29th that his cargo ship from Japan was bombarded by Chiang bandit troops entrenched on a small island about eighty miles northeast of Xiamen on November 28th. He pointed out that two hours before the Chiang bandit troops began bombardment, an American aircraft had flown over his ship.

    Recently, with the intensified negotiations and signing of the US-Chiang treaty, and with the intensified US aid to the Chiang bandits, the Chiang bandits are planning to expand the pirate activities of robbing merchant ships of various countries. Stephen Barber's report in the British "News Chronicle" on October 4th worriedly said: "The tension in the Taiwan Strait is increasing… The US Seventh Fleet has been using aircraft taking off from aircraft carriers to monitor British ships."

    Because of this, people feel even more that the statement made by Soviet representative Malik at the Special Political Committee of the General Assembly on December 13th was completely correct. Malik said: "Since the armed forces of the United States completely control Taiwan and the area near Taiwan, what the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan does or does not do is determined by the United States… Therefore, the US Navy stationed in this area bears full responsibility for all piratical activities occurring in Chinese waters." In a proposal submitted on the same day, the Soviet delegation emphasized:

    "The United Nations General Assembly… believes that this behavior is a flagrant violation of the recognized principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas, causes serious obstacles to world trade, and tends to make the situation in the Far East even more serious.

    Hereby strongly condemns this behavior and requests the US government to take necessary steps to prevent such behavior from happening again, and to release the foreign merchant ships and their crew members detained in Taiwan ports."

    Obviously, this completely legitimate and urgent request is in line with the interests of peace and security in the Far East, and it is also consistent with the opinions of representatives of many countries. On December 14th, the Syrian representative proposed a motion requesting all member states of the United Nations to respect freedom of navigation at sea, which is undoubtedly a moral condemnation of those who support and carry out piracy.

    However, what is very surprising is that in his speech at the Special Political Committee of the General Assembly on December 13th, British government representative to the United Nations, Pink, did his best to distort the facts, saying that "the most serious incidents" of interference with British ships in Chinese waters were "carried out by the forces of the People's Government of China"; and regarding the interception of ships of various countries near Taiwan, "it is impossible to believe that the United States is involved."

    One really has to wonder if this Mr. Pink is speaking on behalf of Britain. When he tells this lie, does he not know that British ships are precisely the ones most harmed by US-Chiang pirate activities? The lack of concern for British lives and property on the part of this representative of the United Kingdom is truly like "praising the sharp knife after one's head has fallen."

    Currently, the discussion of the United Nations General Assembly is still in progress. The US aggressors and their accomplices are also trying their best to deny and shirk responsibility. But in the face of irrefutable facts, all denials are futile. The responsibility of the United Nations lies in quickly passing the correct and timely proposal of the Soviet Union, so as to stop the pirate activities of the US-Chiang clique in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.

    制止美蒋的海盗活动
    胡思升
    今年九月三十日和十月十八日，驻联合国的苏联代表团团长两度写信给联合国大会主席，要求把“侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”案列入联大议程。苏联代表团当时明确指出：“鉴于苏联代表团所提出的问题不仅是个别商船在公海上遭到袭击的问题，而是涉及一贯严重破坏公认的公海航行自由的原则的罪行”，因此，要求把它“作为一个重要和迫切的问题，列入联合国大会第九届会议的议程。”
    但是，做贼心虚的美国侵略集团十分害怕讨论这个议案，始则操纵联大延期讨论把此议案列入议程的问题，而在联大把这个问题列入议程后，又企图使联大不认真讨论这个议案而草草结束。现在，在苏联以及其他主持正义的代表的坚定努力下，联大特别政委会已在十三日正式开始讨论“侵犯在中国海面的航行自由”案。
    苏联代表团坚决主张把这个议案作为一个重要和迫切的问题来加以审议，是完全正当的。人所共知，几年来，蒋介石卖国集团的海空军在美国海空军的支持下肆无忌惮地骚扰我国沿海航运和对外贸易，劫夺和拦劫我国及和我国通商的国家的商船，并对受难船员施行屠杀、酷刑、迫害等暴力手段。据不完全的统计，几年来受害的各种中国船舶共达四百七十余艘；在外国船舶方面，据不完全统计，从一九四九年九月到一九五四年十月，蒋介石卖国集团在中国沿海和公海上对六十七艘各国商船进行了一百十一次的拦劫、抢劫、炮击或扫射，其中英国商船受害最重，计四十三艘，共八十六次，并发生过英国船长被击毙、英国船员被击伤的事实；巴拿马商船受害者十四艘，共十五次；波兰、希腊商船各二艘，共四次；苏联、挪威、西德、荷兰、丹麦、意大利各一艘，共六次。最近，十一月十三日、十四日、二十二日和二十八日，英国商船“易隆号”、“华利号”、日本渔船两艘和丹麦货船一艘又分别遭到蒋贼军舰的袭击，日本渔船并被击沉。
    由此可见，在美国庇护下的蒋贼的海盗行为已经到了如此无法无天的地步，实际上和中世纪海盗的抢人越货毫无二致。这就彻底破坏了在公海航行不受侵犯的传统，严重损害了各航运国家的利益，妨碍了各国之间正常贸易关系的开展，造成了远东海面的紧张局势，因而引起了各国公众舆论的普遍愤怒和不安。苏联政府和波兰政府曾先后数度照会美国，对美蒋拦劫苏波两国商船的海盗行为提出强硬的抗议。英国公众的愤怒情绪也经常反映到英国国会中。就在最近，十一月二十四日，一些英国工党议员还在下院就国民党军舰在中国海面上对英国商船所采取的海盗行动向外交大臣艾登提出了若干问题。据路透社报道，艾登回答这些问题时说，英国已就本月早些时候以台湾为基地的军舰拘留两艘英国商船一事向“中国国民党当局”提出抗议。另据报界联合会说，工党议员戴维斯要求艾登“向明知蒋介石所有的每一只海盗船实际上就是美国船的有关方面提出抗议”。
    的确，正如工党议员戴维斯所指出的，蒋介石所有的每一只海盗船实际上就是美国的船。谁都知道，美国第七舰队根据美国政府的命令控制着台湾附近的公海，并侵犯我国的领海领空；至于蒋介石卖国集团，它是靠美国的拨款来维持的，蒋贼军的武器、军舰、飞机、弹药无一不是由美国装备和供给并受着五角大楼的指挥。没有美国刺刀的支持，蒋介石是活不下去的，更谈不到胆敢如此猖狂。实际上，在蒋贼的每一次海盗活动中，美国海空军都是直接参加者。
    今年九月二十六日的法新社电就指出：“在过去三年中，每当一艘英国商船在台湾海峡上出现的时候，就由美国第七舰队的一架侦察飞机加以监视，并由这架飞机报告国民党的舰队。国民党就派炮艇去拦劫这只商船。”美国“每日镜报”专栏作家德鲁·皮尔逊也承认在苏联油船“图阿普斯号”被扣留以前，美国派一架海军水上飞机在它的上空盘旋了好久，“这架飞机和中国国民党分子保持直接的联系，并通知他们到哪里去找这艘苏联油船。”
    据共同社报道，十一月二十二日，日本渔船“山田丸”第三十一号和第三十二号在大陈岛附近公海海面被美国造的船舰击沉。同时，据“朝日新闻”报道，遇救的日本船员说，他们曾看到一艘美国驱逐舰在轰击地点附近巡逻。另据路透社报道，据丹麦货船“埃米利·马尔斯克号”的船长比尔特·弗林明十一月二十九日说，他的从日本开出的货船十一月二十八日遭到盘踞在厦门东北八十英里左右一个小岛上的蒋贼军的炮轰。他指出，在蒋贼军开始炮轰之前两小时，有一架美国飞机曾在他的船上空飞行。
    近来，随着美蒋条约的加紧谈判和签订，随着美国对蒋贼的加紧援助，蒋贼正策划扩大劫夺各国商船的海盗活动。十月四日的英国“新闻纪事报”所载斯蒂芬·巴勃尔的报道就忧虑地说：“台湾海峡中的紧张程度正在增涨中……。美国第七舰队一直都在用由航空母舰上起飞的飞机监视英国船只。”
    正因为这样，人们更加感到苏联代表马立克十二月十三日在联大特别政委会上发言的完全正确。马立克说：“美国的武装的力量既然完全控制着台湾和台湾附近区域，因此台湾的蒋介石集团要做什么或者不做什么，都是由美国决定的。……因此，驻在这一区域的美国海军对在中国海面发生的一切海盗式活动负有完全的责任。”苏联代表团在同日提出的提案中强调指出：
    “联合国大会……认为这种行为是一种恶劣地破坏公认的公海航行自由的原则的行为，给世界贸易造成严重的障碍，并且有使远东的局势变得更加严重的趋势。
    兹特强烈谴责这种行为，并要求美国政府采取必要步骤，以防止这种行为再度发生，并释放被扣留在台湾港口的外国商船和它们的船员。”
    很显然，这一完全正当和迫切的要求，是符合远东和平和安全的利益的，而且也是和许多国家代表的意见一致的。十二月十四日，叙利亚代表提出一项提案，要求联合国全体会员国尊重海上航行自由，这无疑是对支持和进行海盗活动的人的一种道义上的谴责。
    但是，令人十分诧异的是，英国政府驻联合国代表平克十二月十三日在联大特别政委会上的发言中，竟极尽颠倒黑白的能事，说什么在中国海干涉英国船只的“最严重的事件是中国人民政府的部队所作的”；而对于在台湾附近截扣各国船只的问题，“不可能相信美国是有干系的。”
    人们真要怀疑这位平克先生是在代表英国讲话的了。当他撒这个谎的时候，难道他不知道英国船只恰恰是受美蒋海盗活动危害最深的国家吗？这位联合王国的代表的不关心英国生命财产的情形，真像是“人头落地后还赞扬好快刀”一样。
    现在，联合国大会的讨论还在进行中。美国侵略者及其帮凶们也在百般抵赖和推卸责任。但在无可辩驳的事实面前，一切抵赖都是徒然的。联合国的责任就在于迅速通过苏联的正确适时的提案，以便根据联合国宪章和国际法的原则，制止美蒋的海盗行为。
