Radford's Dirty Business

Li Gao

The extremely bellicose Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, recently made a so-called "lightning visit" to South Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Pakistan, and the Philippines, and is now preparing to go to Taiwan for conspiratorial activities.

Before coming to the Far East, Radford participated in the US-UK-France talks in Paris regarding Indochina policy. Many signs indicate that the American aggressor group is coercing countries such as Britain and France to undermine the Geneva Conference agreements in order to directly intervene in Indochina and turn South Vietnam into an American military base.

In Saigon, Radford successively held talks with U.S. Special Envoy to South Vietnam Collins, the head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group to Indochina O'Daniel, as well as the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and the French military authorities in Indochina. Radford said: "I will definitely adopt the opinions put forward by General Collins." What are Collins' opinions? According to a Washington dispatch in the "Hindustan Times" on December 22, Collins recently submitted a report to Washington requesting that the United States "must take urgent action" to prepare for undermining the 1956 Vietnamese democratic elections, while stepping up efforts to squeeze out French influence in Indochina. The report said: "The French must accelerate their withdrawal and hand over the work of defending (?) South Vietnam to local troops trained and equipped by the United States." In order to achieve the sinister goals of the United States, Radford's briefcase carried a large stack of conspiracy plans to undermine the Geneva Conference agreements and endanger peace and security in Southeast Asia. According to American "New York Post" reporter Alan, Radford actually advocated that the United States and the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique and Thailand conclude a "joint defense treaty" similar to the US-Chiang treaty. In Bangkok, Radford publicly stated that he believed it "would be useful" for the United States to bundle Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique together to form a military group.

Radford's activities in Southeast Asia are clearly preparing the ground for the U.S. aggressor group to take new aggressive military measures in Southeast Asian countries, and to exert pressure on Southeast Asian military group countries to drive them to follow U.S. adventures and share the responsibility for U.S. undermining of the Geneva Conference agreements. This intention of the U.S. aggressor group has been confirmed by the remarks of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. At a press conference in Washington on December 21, Dulles publicly stated that the United States requires the "redeployment" of "combat troops" in Indochina and the "development" of Ngo Dinh Diem's security forces, which is in line with Radford's activities. Dulles also announced that the United States has decided "in principle" to hold the first meeting of Southeast Asian military group countries at the end of February next year. According to a report in the "Hindustan Times": "One of the main purposes of Mr. Dulles' desire to convene a meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is to formulate precise military plans to take collective action under the treaty to defend (should read as interfere with) Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia."

So, what does Radford want to do in Taiwan? According to Western newspapers and news agencies: Radford is going to Taiwan to plan the specific implementation of the US-Chiang treaty, including inspecting and selecting sites for the construction of U.S. Army and Air Force military bases, and discussing
  "military cooperation" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. It is said that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is rushing to draft a "comprehensive military plan" to hand over to Radford for "consideration and discussion." From these preliminary facts, it can be seen that the purpose of Radford's trip to Taiwan is not only to strengthen the U.S.'s illegal occupation of Taiwan and Penghu, which are our country's territories, but also to step up collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to prepare for war and adventures, in order to expand the U.S.'s aggression against our country and undermine peace in Asia and the world.

Since the Geneva Conference reached an agreement to restore peace in Indochina, the people of Asia and peace-loving countries in Asia have unanimously demanded that relevant countries follow the principles of peaceful coexistence on the basis of restoring peace in Indochina, further ease tensions, and establish and expand peace zones in Asia. However, the U.S. aggressor group has always been hostile to this peaceful aspiration of the people of Asian countries. Disregarding the opposition of major Southeast Asian countries, it assembled its followers to form a Southeast Asian military group aimed at undermining the Geneva Conference agreements, and then signed a US-Chiang war treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

Under the severe condemnation of public opinion around the world, the U.S. aggressor group and its followers have tried to cover up the aggressive and war-like nature of the Southeast Asia military group treaty and the US-Chiang treaty. But the facts completely expose all these lies.

Since the signing of the Southeast Asia military group treaty, the United States has violated the Geneva Conference agreements and has increasingly brazenly interfered in Indochina. The activities of the United States in driving its followers—the Philippines and Thailand, etc.—to expand their armies and prepare for war have also become increasingly intensified. With the signing of the US-Chiang treaty, the United States also hurriedly transported a large number of military weapons such as torpedo boats and jet aircraft to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. United Press International shamelessly stated that the United States did this "in order to greatly increase the mobility and offensive power of Chiang Kai-shek's troops." At the same time, the United States has also greatly increased the aggressive military forces of the Navy and Air Force in the Pacific, and has adopted a series of military deployments—such as adjusting command systems and blocking news, etc. Recently, the U.S. Seventh Fleet even conducted a provocative exercise near our country's waters, which was "the largest since the end of the Korean War." All this shows that what the U.S. aggressor group is plotting is to worsen the situation in the Far East, thereby creating conditions for its war of aggression.

Under these circumstances, Radford personally appeared on the stage.

Everyone knows that Radford is a warmonger who has always been hostile to China and the people of Asia. As early as June 1950, before the United States announced its forcible occupation of our country's Taiwan, Radford publicly clamored for "occupying Taiwan." In recent years, Radford and the notorious warmongers such as Nolan and Robertson have been advocating and clamoring for launching large-scale wars against China and Asia, and for carrying out atomic intimidation against the people of Asian countries. Recently, Radford and Nolan have been clamoring for "blockading" China.

Obviously, the Radford clique has not learned a lesson from the failure of the U.S. war of aggression against Korea. The Chinese people and the people of Asian countries see Radford's aggressive activities clearly. The Chinese people and peace-loving people of Asian countries will surely smash the conspiracy and adventures of the Radford clique to undermine peace in Asia with more resolute blows.

    雷德福干的是什么勾当
    李高
    极端好战的美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福，最近在南越、柬埔寨、泰国、巴基斯坦和菲律宾进行了一次所谓“闪电式访问”，现在正准备前往台湾进行阴谋活动。
    雷德福来远东之前，曾在巴黎参加了美英法三国关于印度支那政策的商谈。许多迹象表明，美国侵略集团是要挟持英法等国破坏日内瓦会议的协议，以便直接干涉印度支那，把南越变成美国的军事基地。
    雷德福在西贡时，先后同美国驻南越特使柯林斯、美国驻印度支那军事援助顾问团团长奥丹尼尔以及吴庭艳集团和法国驻印度支那军事当局举行了会谈。雷德福说：“我一定采纳柯林斯将军所提出的意见。”柯林斯的意见是什么呢？据“印度斯坦时报”十二月二十二日的华盛顿消息透露，柯林斯最近向华盛顿提出了一个报告，他要求美国“必须采取紧急行动”来准备破坏一九五六年的越南民主选举，同时加紧排挤法国在印度支那的势力。这个报告说：“法国人必须加速撤退，把保卫（？）南越的工作交由美国训练和装备的本地军队担任。”为了达到美国的罪恶目的，雷德福的皮包里带着一大叠破坏日内瓦会议协议、危害东南亚和平和安全的阴谋计划。据美国“纽约邮报”记者艾伦透露，雷德福竟主张美国同南越吴庭艳集团和泰国缔结类似美蒋条约的“共同防御条约”。雷德福在曼谷公开说，他认为美国把泰国、老挝、柬埔寨和南越的吴庭艳集团捆在一起组成一个军事集团“将是有用的”。
    雷德福在东南亚的活动，显然是为美国侵略集团在东南亚国家采取新的侵略性的军事措施进行准备工作，并向东南亚军事集团国家施行压力，驱使它们追随美国冒险，分担美国破坏日内瓦会议协议的责任。美国侵略集团的这种意图，已为美国国务卿杜勒斯的谈话所证实了。杜勒斯十二月二十一日在华盛顿的记者招待会上公开说：美国要求“重新部署”在印度支那的“作战部队”，要求“发展”吴庭艳集团的保安部队，这是与雷德福的活动正相符合的。杜勒斯还宣布：美国在“原则上”已决定明年二月底召开东南亚军事集团国家的首次会议。据“印度斯坦时报”的消息说：“杜勒斯先生想要召开东南亚条约组织会议的主要目的之一，是拟订确切的军事计划，以便根据条约采取集体行动来保卫（应读作干涉）越南、老挝和柬埔寨。”
    那么，雷德福到台湾去想干些什么呢？据西方报纸和通讯社透露：雷德福是要在台湾策划实施美蒋条约的具体办法，包括视察和选择建筑美国陆军和空军军事基地的地点、同蒋介石卖国集团商讨
  “军事配合”等方面的问题。据说，蒋介石卖国集团正在赶忙拟订一个什么“全面的军事计划”，以便交给雷德福“考虑和讨论”。仅从这些初步透露出来的事实就可以看出，雷德福台湾之行的目的，不但是在希图强化美国对我国领土台湾、澎湖的非法占领，而且是在加紧勾结蒋介石卖国集团准备战争和冒险，以图扩大美国对我国的侵略，并破坏亚洲和世界的和平。
    自从日内瓦会议达成了恢复印度支那和平的协议以来，亚洲人民和亚洲爱好和平的国家，都一致要求有关国家在恢复印度支那和平的基础上，遵循和平共处的原则，进一步缓和紧张局势，在亚洲建立和扩大和平地区。可是，美国侵略集团始终敌视亚洲各国人民的这种和平愿望。它不顾东南亚各主要国家的反对，纠合它的追随者组成了旨在破坏日内瓦会议协议的东南亚军事集团，紧接着又和蒋介石卖国集团签订了一个美蒋战争条约。
    在全世界公众舆论的严厉谴责之下，美国侵略集团和它的追随者曾经力图掩饰东南亚军事集团条约和美蒋条约的侵略性质和战争性质。但事实却彻底洞穿了这一切的谎言。
    从东南亚军事集团条约签订之后，美国违背日内瓦会议协议，日益嚣张地对印度支那实行干涉。美国驱使它的追随者——菲律宾和泰国等进行扩军备战的活动也越来越加紧。随着美蒋条约的签订，美国又赶紧把鱼雷艇、喷气式飞机等军火武器大量运交蒋介石卖国集团。合众社毫不掩饰地说：美国这样做，“为的是大大地增加蒋介石部队的机动性和攻击力量”。同时，美国还大量增加了太平洋的海空军侵略兵力，并且采取了一系列的军事部署——如调整指挥系统、封锁新闻等等。最近，美国第七舰队竟在接近我国的海面举行了“朝鲜战争结束以来最大规模的”一次挑衅性的演习。这一切都说明：美国侵略集团所图谋的，就是使远东局势恶化，从而为其侵略战争制造条件。
    在这种情况下，雷德福亲自出场了。
    谁都知道，雷德福是一贯敌视中国和亚洲人民的好战分子。早在一九五○年六月美国宣布强占我国台湾之前，雷德福就公开叫嚣要“占领台湾”。这几年来，雷德福和诺兰、罗伯逊等臭名远扬的好战分子，一直在主张和叫喊向中国和亚洲发动大规模战争，并向亚洲各国人民进行原子恫吓。最近，雷德福和诺兰等又在叫喊要“封锁”中国。
    显然，雷德福之流还没有从美国侵朝战争的失败中接受教训。中国人民和亚洲各国人民对于雷德福的侵略活动是看得清楚的，中国人民和亚洲各国爱好和平的人民必将以更坚决的打击来粉碎雷德福之流破坏亚洲和平的阴谋和冒险。
