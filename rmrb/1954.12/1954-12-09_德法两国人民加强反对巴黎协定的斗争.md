Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: Berlin dispatch: As Western countries and the Bonn group collude to accelerate the passage of the Paris Agreements and deepen the division of Germany, patriots from all walks of life in East and West Germany have gathered to discuss and jointly pass resolutions opposing the Paris Agreements and demanding negotiations to restore German unification.

More than 450 East and West German shipbuilding workers, at a meeting held in Warnemünde, discussed the issues of opposing the Paris Agreements and striving for the peaceful reunification of Germany. They adopted a joint action program at the meeting, which called on all trade union workers to rise up and prevent the conscription of West German youth. The meeting stipulated the use of rallies, signature drives, and sending delegations to the Bonn Federal Parliament and state parliaments to protest against West Germany's reactionary measures. The meeting also passed a resolution opposing the banning of the German Communist Party.

Seven hundred East and West German Christians unanimously passed a resolution at a meeting in Leipzig opposing the London and Paris Agreements. The resolution pointed out that the London and Paris Agreements attempt to drag the German people into the vortex of the arms race. Therefore, a movement against the London and Paris Agreements must be launched. The resolution stated that Christians throughout Germany must work to eliminate the threat to peace and promote the German people to move towards the path of understanding with all nations.

Six hundred women representatives from East and West Berlin, at the All-Berlin Women's Congress, discussed the issue of taking joint measures to defend peace and restore German unification. The congress passed a program that demanded the guarantee of the security of the European people, the achievement of understanding between Germans, and the withdrawal of all occupation forces. The program called on women throughout Berlin to unite to strive for and defend their rights.

Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: TASS, Paris, December 7th: The "Liaison Committee of Initiators for Organizing a New Left-Wing United Group," established in May of this year, recently held a meeting in Paris. The committee expressed its opposition to the arming of West Germany in any form, and especially to the London and Paris Agreements.

Participants in the meeting included representatives from the "Left-Wing Non-Party Action Center," the Young Republicans, and the Progressive Republican Alliance, as well as observers from groups such as the "People's Liberation Movement" and editorial observers from newspapers and magazines such as "Bi-Weekly" and "Tribune." Members of the committee include National Assembly members Delavallée, Denis, and Vallon, Republican Senate member Hamon, and French Federation Council members Mitterrand and Moulec.

The committee also discussed the issue of "conditions for immediate action to establish a new popular front."
  
Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: TASS, Paris, December 7th: "Le Monde" published an article by Republican Senate member Hamon, who was expelled from the Popular Republican Party for opposing the "European Defense Community."

Hamon drew everyone's attention to the danger that France would succumb to the rule of Bonn once the Paris Agreements were ratified, because France would lose its independence over West Germany's foreign policy.

Hamon pointed out that ratifying the Paris Agreements would seriously hinder negotiations between East and West. Hamon wrote: "No matter what others think, France cannot sacrifice its security for a decision."

Hamon said that since these agreements give Germany the privilege to agree to peace or launch a war, "for France, they would mean losing legal and diplomatic rights, and for the whole world, these agreements would mean falling into a very dangerous gamble."

    德法两国人民加强反对巴黎协定的斗争
    【新华社八日讯】柏林消息：在西方国家和波恩集团勾结，加紧准备通过巴黎协定和加深德国分裂的时候，东西德各界爱国人士纷纷到一起进行商讨，共同通过决议，反对巴黎协定，要求协商恢复德国的统一。
    四百五十多名东西德的造船工人在瓦内蒙得举行的会议上，讨论了反对巴黎协定和争取和平恢复德国统一的问题。他们在会议上通过了联合行动的纲领，这个纲领号召所有的工会工作者起来阻止征募西德青年。会议规定用集会、征集签名和派遣代表团前往波恩联邦议院和州议会的办法，抗议西德的反动措施。会议并通过决议，反对禁止德国共产党。
    七百名东西德的基督教徒在来比锡会议上一致通过决议，反对伦敦和巴黎协定。决议指出：伦敦和巴黎协定企图把德国人卷入军备竞赛的漩涡中。因此，必须展开反对伦敦和巴黎协定的运动。决议说：全德国的基督教徒必须致力于消除和平的威胁，并促使德国人走向各国人民谅解的道路。
    六百名东西柏林的妇女代表在全柏林妇女代表大会上，讨论了关于为保卫和平和恢复德国统一而采取联合措施的问题。代表大会通过了一项纲领，纲领要求保障欧洲人民的安全，要求德国人之间取得谅解和撤退一切占领军。纲领号召全柏林的妇女联合起来，争取和保卫她们的权利。
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎七日讯：在今年五月成立的“争取组织新左翼联合团体发起人联络委员会”最近在巴黎举行会议。委员会表示反对以任何形式武装西德，特别反对伦敦和巴黎协定。
    参加会议的有“左翼无党派人士行动中心”、青年共和党和进步共和联盟的代表，还有“人民解放运动”等团体观察员以及“双周”、“灵报”等报章杂志编辑部的观察员。参加委员会工作的有国民议会议员德拉维热里、德尼和伐隆，共和国参议院议员阿蒙和法兰西联邦议会议员密特朗和穆莱克。
    委员会还讨论了“为成立新人民阵线而立即行动的条件”问题。
      【新华社八日讯】塔斯社巴黎七日电：“世界报”登载了因为反对“欧洲防务集团”而被人民共和党开除党籍的共和国参议院议员阿蒙的一篇文章。
    阿蒙提请大家注意：一旦巴黎协定得到批准，法国就有屈从于波恩统治者的危险，因为法国将丧失它对西德外交政策的独立。
    阿蒙指出：批准巴黎协定，将严重地妨害东西方之间的谈判。阿蒙写道：“不管别人怎样想，法国不能为了一个决定而牺牲它的安全。”
    阿蒙说：由于这些协定给了德国同意和平或者发动战争的特权，因此，“对法国来说，它们就意味着失去法律和外交方面的权利，对全世界来说，这些协定将意味着陷入非常危险的赌博”。
