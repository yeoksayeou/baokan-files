Xinhua News Agency, December 27th dispatch: According to Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 26th condemning the "mutual defense treaty" signed by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

The statement said: This action by the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek clique has exposed the sinister aim of the US imperialists to occupy Taiwan and Penghu for a long time and turn these territories into US military bases in order to prepare for a war of aggression against China. This action is an extremely serious violation of Chinese sovereignty and a shameless interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.

This action proves that the US government has openly abandoned the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation it concluded with other major powers and signed itself, which recognize Taiwan and Penghu as part of Chinese territory.

This action proves that the US imperialists are deliberately undermining the United Nations Charter, which strictly prohibits any violation of the territorial integrity of any country in the world.

This action has created new tensions, undermined the efforts of the Asian people to defend peace and develop international friendly relations, and thus directly threatened peace in Asia.

This action is part of the US imperialist policy of seeking world hegemony, which is trying its best to establish military aggression blocs around the world, thereby threatening the independence and security of the people of all countries and undermining peaceful coexistence in this world.

The statement said: In order to actively implement this policy, the US imperialists have used every possible means to establish the aggressive Southeast Asia group, unilaterally including South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia within the region of this aggressive group. They sent General J. Lawton Collins to Saigon to lead the French colonialists who have been sabotaging the armistice agreement and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique who have been shamelessly violating the Geneva Accords and undermining the consolidation of peace in Vietnam.

The statement said: The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believe that Taiwan and Penghu belong to Chinese territory. The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly oppose the US-Chiang treaty signed on December 2, 1954, and fully support the statement issued by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, on December 8, 1954, demanding that the US government withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu and the Taiwan Strait.

The statement said: The Vietnamese people, who are fighting for peace, unification, independence and democracy and against any US interference in South Vietnam and any attempt to undermine the Geneva Accords, firmly support the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and make China's territory complete.

    越外交部发表声明斥责美蒋条约
    【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社河内讯：越南民主共和国外交部二十六日发表声明斥责美国和蒋介石卖国集团签订的“共同防御条约”。
    声明说：美国政府同蒋介石集团的这一行动已经把美帝国主义者想长期占领台湾和澎湖并把这些领土变为美国军事基地以便准备对中国发动侵略战争这种罪恶目的暴露无遗。这一行动是对中国主权的一种极严重的破坏，是对中华人民共和国内政的一种无耻的干涉。
    这一行动证明，美国政府公开背弃它同其他大国缔结的、它自己在上面签了字的开罗宣言和波茨坦公告，这些国际协定承认台湾和澎湖是中国领土的一部分。
    这一行动证明，美帝国主义者故意破坏联合国宪章，宪章严格禁止对世界任何国家的领土完整有任何侵犯。
    这一行动造成了新的紧张局势，破坏亚洲人民为保卫和平和发展国际友好关系而作的努力，因而直接地威胁亚洲的和平。
    这一行动是美帝国主义独霸世界的政策的一部分，它竭力要在全世界建立军事侵略集团，从而威胁各国人民的独立和安全，破坏在这个世界上的和平共处。
    声明说：美帝国主义者为了积极实现这个政策，已经采用一切可能的办法成立了侵略性的东南亚集团，片面地把南越、老挝和柬埔寨包括在这个侵略性集团的地区之内。他们派遣杰·劳顿·柯林斯将军到西贡去领导一直在破坏停战协定的法国殖民主义分子和一直无耻地违反日内瓦协议并且破坏越南和平的巩固的吴庭艳集团。
    声明说：越南人民和越南民主共和国政府认为：台湾和澎湖是属于中国的领土。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚决反对一九五四年十二月二日签订的美蒋条约，全力支持中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来在一九五四年十二月八日发表的要求美国政府把它所有的武装部队撤出台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡的声明。
    声明说：正在为和平、统一、独立和民主而斗争，反对美国干涉南越和破坏日内瓦协议的一切企图的越南人民，坚决支持中国人民解放台湾使中国领土完整的斗争。
