The Supervisory Office of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory was established in July of last year. Prior to June of this year, the main task of the Supervisory Office was to investigate and deal with violations of laws and discipline within the factory. It also handled accidents involving damaged machinery and equipment, substandard product quality, and violations of safety production regulations. However, it had not conducted inspections of the implementation of production plans. Many employees were not fully aware of what the supervisory work actually entailed. Some even considered the Supervisory Office to be "trouble makers." In January of this year, the Supervisory Office investigated and dealt with an incident where the factory produced a batch of elbow screws for the Taiyuan Railway Administration Materials Factory that did not fully guarantee quality. After this, supervisory work began to develop among all employees of the factory. However, employees still lacked a clear understanding of the primary task of supervisory work in enterprises—inspecting the implementation of production, financial, and capital construction plans—and the Supervisory Office staff also lacked sufficient awareness.

After the Third National Supervisory Work Conference and the Second Supervisory Work Conference held by the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, the Supervisory Office reported the spirit and resolutions of the meetings to the factory director and the factory Party committee, and conveyed them to all factory employees at staff meetings and to workers in each workshop, in conjunction with specific circumstances. It also organized all factory employees to conduct discussions. In this way, the task of enterprise supervisory work gradually gained importance, and employees gained a further understanding of supervisory work.

In June of this year, the production plan of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory was not completed. In order to clarify the reasons, the Supervisory Office requested and obtained the approval of the factory director and the factory Party committee, and invited personnel from the Party committee, administration, trade union, Communist Youth League, planning section, production section, and production preparation office to participate in the formation of an inspection team for focused inspection.

In June, the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory only completed 64.01 percent of its total production value. Among the production tasks, the main product, the "50-ton overhead crane," was only 50 percent completed. In response to the failure to complete this major task, the inspection team first made preliminary inquiries to the planning section, production section, and production preparation office, and then focused on inspecting the technology section, production and sales section, technical inspection section, and the metalworking workshop. Relevant responsible comrades from the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League of the units concerned were invited to participate in the inspection.

The inspection revealed that the main reasons for the failure to complete the June production plan were: First, the plan was not realistic. Due to inaccurate time quotas, the plan did not match the actual work situation. There were also problems with the formulation of the work plan. The plans of the two workshops were not connected, which affected the overall completion of the task. Second, the execution of the plan was not serious. After the plan was formulated, some cadres believed that "the plan is the plan, and execution is execution," and did not actively and resolutely complete the plan. Xie Binyuan, the former director of the metalworking workshop, once said: "It doesn't matter if the plan is not completed, just don't have an accident." Third, insufficient attention was paid to the work plan. For example, the metalworking workshop was required to process "50-ton overhead cranes" in the plan, but they blindly said that the materials and blanks had not arrived and could not be processed. In fact, the materials and blanks were already waiting to be processed in the warehouse, but they did not specifically check, so they did not implement the work plan. Other reasons included poor labor organization, inflexible planning and scheduling, improper analysis of work and materials, mutual buck-passing, procrastination, lack of seriousness in the execution of contracts, untimely material supply, untimely inspection, incorrect and missed inspections causing idle work and rework, product quality accidents, frequent scrapping, and untimely supply of drawings, poor design, and modifications during construction.

The inspection team reported the final inspection results and handling recommendations to the factory director and the factory Party committee. Subsequently, a general meeting of all factory employees was held, where the Supervisory Office made a report. The deputy factory director, on behalf of the administrative side, announced the handling of the relevant derelict personnel, and pointed out that the relevant units must formulate measures to improve their work.

After this handling, the various units put forward measures to improve their work. The measures taken by the technology section to improve its work were: in order to overcome the chaotic phenomena within the section, it was decided to implement the "Technology Section Manufacturing Drawing Construction Preparation Notification" method; in order to closely cooperate with other sections and offices and solve problems in a timely manner, it was decided to implement the "Work and Material Liaison Form" method. Afterwards, the work of the section changed from passive to active. For example, it was able to actively design tools for the "50-ton overhead crane" and established a "tool card system," initially overcoming and reversing the chaotic phenomena within the section. The main shortcomings of the technical inspection section were untimely inspection, incorrect and missed inspections. Therefore, their measures to improve their work were: to specifically stipulate the first-piece (after casting) inspection system; to establish a workshop inspection team meeting; the safekeeping of drawings to be the responsibility of a dedicated person; and to stipulate that the inspection work of the "50-ton overhead crane" trial production task should be the focus of inspection, and to inspect the tools before processing to ensure that no scrapping accidents occur due to incorrect inspection. The production and sales section and the metalworking workshop, and other units, have all put forward measures to improve their work.

This inspection and handling left a deep impression on the minds of the employees. Liu Wuqiao, a technician from the technical inspection section, said to the Supervisory Office: "My mistakes in the inspection work are indeed facts. I must continue to examine the areas where my subjective efforts are insufficient and improve the inspection work." Shi Qiwen, an engineer from the safety technology section, reflected: "The procrastination phenomena revealed today also exist in our section. In the future, it will not be possible to deal with problems in a timely manner." Liu Chenjun, a planner from the production section, reflected: "Liu Ligong, the leader of the planning team in the metalworking workshop, is irresponsible. We have repeatedly urged him to the workshop, but he ignored us, making it impossible for us to understand his work. Now that he has caused losses to the state due to his irresponsibility, his handling (demerit) is completely correct. This is also a lesson for us, giving us a warning." Because many problems were being solved while being inspected, the factory director and the factory Party committee strengthened their leadership in all aspects in early July, and conducted a review of the July plan both inside and outside the Party, and made revisions to individual unrealistic parts. In addition, with the joint efforts of all factory employees, the July production task completed 106.39 percent of the total production value; August completed 109.76 percent. At the same time, the prestige of the Supervisory Office among the employees has also been improved. Employees are actively reporting situations to the Supervisory Office, exposing problems in production. According to September statistics alone, 52 cases were received from employees, of which 33 were related to problems in the implementation of production plans, such as materials, drawings, supplies, and product quality.

The Supervisory Office of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory has realized through this inspection and handling of the implementation of production plans that in order to carry out enterprise supervisory work well, it is first necessary to actively publicize the nature, powers, tasks, and importance of supervisory work to employees, so that everyone can understand this new work. For the handling of important cases and the inspection of the implementation of plans, the inspection results and how to handle them should be announced at the employee congress and publicized using various propaganda tools. Secondly, systematic and comprehensive inspections of the implementation of the plan must start with key inspections. Relevant units should be invited to participate in the inspection, and the inspected units should also be invited to participate. This makes it easy to find problems existing in production. In the inspection, it is necessary to grasp the key problems and carry out inspections in combination with the central task, so that the investigation can be clear and thorough. Thirdly, it is necessary to adopt the policy of learning, doing, inspecting, and solving simultaneously. Before inspecting the failure to complete the June plan, the Supervisory Office did not understand the relevant situation. It once asked the heads of the planning section and production section to report the reasons why they understood the plan had not been completed. During the inspection, new situations were learned every day, and then the next step was specifically determined how to inspect and the problems to be clarified. In the inspection, problems were discovered, and the relevant units were asked to solve them at any time; derelict personnel were found, and the Supervisory Office immediately notified them to conduct a review, and at the same time pointed out the final handling principle, which was to see if there was any improvement in his work. Therefore, after the inspection, the inspected units and individuals were generally more active and responsible than before. The production and sales section fully inspected the implementation of contracts twice in half a month. Finally, when problems are discovered, it is necessary to report them to the responsible comrades of the Party and government in a timely manner to obtain leadership support, so that the inspection can proceed smoothly and the results will be great.

The work of the Supervisory Office of the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory is now being carried out. However, at present, the Supervisory Office has limited manpower and can still only conduct planned key inspections; the inspection of production work is only to understand and review the implementation of the improvement measures formulated by each unit at any time. In the future, the Supervisory Office will strengthen contact with units such as the planning section, production section, and production preparation office, as well as people's supervisory correspondents throughout the factory, in order to discover problems existing in production in a timely manner, and report them to leading comrades and relevant units for handling in a timely manner, and further strengthen the inspection of the implementation of production plans.

    监察室的作用
    吴从龙
    太原重型机器厂监察室建立于去年七月间。在今年六月份以前，监察室的工作主要是检查处理厂内违法乱纪案件，也处理了一些损坏机器设备的事故，产品质量不好和违反安全生产等事件，但没作过生产计划执行情况的检查。不少职工对监察工作究竟干什么是不完全了解的。个别职工甚至认为监察室是“找麻烦”的。今年一月间，监察室检查处理了厂里为太原铁路管理局材料厂做一批弯头螺丝没有完全保证质量的事故，以后监察工作在全厂职工中初步开展起来。但对监察工作在企业中的主要任务——检查生产财务和基本建设计划执行情况——职工们仍然认识不清，监察室工作人员的认识也不够。
    第三次全国监察工作会议和第一机械工业部举行的第二次监察工作会议以后，监察室把会议的精神和决议向厂长、厂党委作了汇报，并在全厂职员大会上和各车间工人中结合具体情况分别作了传达，还组织全厂职工进行了讨论。这样，企业监察工作的任务就逐渐被重视起来，职工们对监察工作也有了进一步的认识。
    今年六月份太原重型机器厂的生产计划没有完成。监察室为了弄清原因，就报请厂长、厂党委批准，并请党委、行政、工会、青年团以及计划科、生产科、生产准备室都派人参加，组成检查组进行重点检查。
    太原重型机器厂六月份计划只完成了生产总值百分之六十四点零一，生产任务中主要产品“五十吨行车”只完成百分之五十。针对这项主要任务的不能完成，检查组首先向计划科、生产科和生产准备室作了初步了解，然后以工艺科、生产供销科、技术检查科和金工车间为重点进行检查。检查时并请有关单位的党政工团负责同志参加。
    检查结果，六月份生产计划没有完成的原因主要是：第一，计划不切合实际。由于工时定额不准确，计划和实际工作情况不符合。作业计划的编制也有问题。两个车间的计划互不连接，就影响了任务的全面完成。第二，执行计划不严肃。计划制订以后，部分干部认为“计划是计划，执行是执行”，而不积极坚决地完成计划。原金工车间主任谢宾元曾经说：“完不成计划不要紧，千万不要出事故。”第三，对作业计划不够重视。如金工车间，“五十吨行车”在计划上要求他们加工，但他们盲目地说材料和毛坯没有来，没法加工。实际上在库房里已经有材料、毛坯等着加工，他们不去具体检查，也就没按作业计划执行。其他，劳动组织不好、计划调度不灵，工料分析不当，互相推诿、工作拖拉，对联系合同执行不严肃、和材料供应不及时，检验不及时、错检和漏检的造成窝工、返工，发生产品质量事故、经常报废，以及图纸的供应不及时，设计不周、施工中间又修改等，也是造成六月份生产计划没有完成的原因。
    检查组把最后检查结果和处理意见向厂长、厂党委作了汇报。随后又召开全厂职工大会，由监察室作了报告，并当场由副厂长代表行政方面宣布对有关失职人员的处理，同时指出各有关单位必须订出改进工作的措施。
    这样处理以后，各单位纷纷提出了改进工作的措施。工艺科改进工作的措施是：为了克服科内混乱现象，决定实行“工艺科制造图纸施工准备通知单”办法；为了和其他科、室密切配合，及时解决问题，决定实行“工料联系单”办法。以后，科的工作就由被动转为主动，如对“五十吨行车”工具能主动进行设计，还建立了“工卡具制度”，初步克服和扭转了科内的混乱现象。技术检查科的缺点主要是检验不及时、错检和漏检，所以他们改进工作的措施是：具体规定首件（铸件后）检查制度；建立车间检验小组的碰头会，图纸的保管专人负责，并规定了重点检查“五十吨行车”试制任务的检验工作，在未加工以前先检验工具，保证不因错检而发生报废事故。生产供销科和金工车间等单位，都提出了改进工作的措施。
    这次检查处理，在职工思想上留下深刻的印象。技术检查科技术员刘午桥对监察室说：“我在检验工作中的错误，确实是事实。我一定要继续检查自己主观努力不够的地方，改进检验工作。”安全技术科工程师史企文反映说：“今天揭发出来的这些拖延现象，我们科也有。今后不及时处理问题可不行了。”生产科计划员刘成俊反映：“金工车间计划组组长刘立功工作不负责任，我们曾经多次到车间督促，他都不理睬我们，使我们无法了解他的工作情况。现在因为他不负责任给国家造成了损失，对他的处理（记过）是完全正确的。这对我们也等于上了一堂课，给我们敲了警钟。”由于有许多问题是一边检查，一边解决，厂长和厂党委在七月初就从各方面加强了领导，在党内外都作了对于七月份计划的审查，把个别不切合实际的地方作了修改，加上全厂职工共同努力，七月份的生产任务完成了生产总值的百分之一百零六点三九；八月份完成了百分之一百零九点七六。同时，监察室在职工中的威信也提高了。职工们积极地向监察室反映情况，揭发生产中的问题。仅据九月份统计，即收到职工们揭发的案件五十二件，其中有关生产计划执行中的材料、图纸、供应和产品质量等方面的问题三十三件。
    太原重型机器厂监察室通过这次对生产计划执行情况的检查处理体会到，要使企业监察工作很好地开展，首先必须积极向职工宣传监察工作的性质、职权、任务和重要性，使大家了解这一新的工作。对重要案件的处理和对计划执行情况的检查，应该在职工大会上宣布检查结果和如何处理，并使用各种宣传工具进行宣传。其次，对计划执行情况的系统的全面的检查，必须从重点检查起，检查时要请有关单位参加，也请被检查单位参加。这样容易发现生产上存在的问题。检查中要抓住关键性的问题，结合中心任务进行检查，才会查得清、查得透。再其次，要采取边学、边做、边查、边解决的方针。这次对六月份没有完成计划的检查，检查以前监察室对有关情况是不了解的，曾经请计划科和生产科科长报告了他们所了解的没完成计划的原因。在检查中每天了解了新的情况，再具体确定下一步如何检查和所要查清的问题。在检查中发现了问题，就随时请有关单位解决；检查出失职人员，就由监察室立即通知他本人进行检讨，同时指出最后处理原则，是看他在工作上有无改进。所以经过检查，被检查的单位和个人一般都比以前积极负责了。生产供销科在半个月内就两次全面检查了合同执行情况。最后，发现了问题要及时向党政负责同志汇报，取得领导上的支持，使检查能顺利进行，收效就大。
    太原重型机器厂监察室的工作现在是开展起来了。但目前监察室人力有限，仍然只能限于进行有计划的重点检查；关于生产工作的检查，只是根据各单位所订的改进措施，随时对执行情况进行了解和复查。今后，监察室将加强对计划科、生产科和生产准备室等单位以及全厂人民监察通讯员的联系，以便及时发现生产中存在的问题，及时报请领导同志和有关单位处理，进一步加强对生产计划执行情形的检查。
