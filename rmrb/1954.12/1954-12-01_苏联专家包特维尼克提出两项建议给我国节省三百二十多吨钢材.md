Soviet Expert Botvinnik Proposes Two Suggestions to Save China Over 320 Tons of Steel

    Soviet expert Botvinnik, who is helping China build the Shenyang Wire Factory, recently put forward two major suggestions, saving China 322 tons of steel (equivalent to 2.11 billion yuan), and accelerating the progress of the project.

    Since May of this year, Soviet expert Botvinnik has been working on testing the load-bearing capacity of asbestos tiles and the main plant's truss girders. During the testing process, he believed that the span of the asbestos tiles could be increased. He suggested that the distance between the steel purlins of the main plant be changed from 0.8 meters to 1.26 meters. The implementation of this suggestion saved the country 180 tons of steel. Another test proved that the original truss girders of the main plant could still be used after reinforcement, saving another 142 tons of steel and allowing the renovation of the main plant to be completed half a year ahead of schedule. The cable factory building (one of the factory buildings in the main plant), which was originally planned to be constructed in 1955, has already started construction this year. This will allow the new machinery and equipment to be installed ahead of schedule.

    苏联专家包特维尼克提出两项建议给我国节省三百二十多吨钢材
    帮助我国建设沈阳电线厂的苏联专家包特维尼克，最近提出两项重大建议，为我国节省了三百二十二吨钢材（折合人民币达二十一亿一千多万元），并且加速了工程进度。
    苏联专家包特维尼克从今年五月起就着手进行石棉瓦和主厂房花梁负荷能力的试验。在试验过程中，他认为可以增加石棉瓦的跨度，他建议把主厂房钢檩之间的距离由零点八公尺改为一公尺二六。这项建议实行后就为国家节省了一百八十吨钢材。另一项试验证明主厂房原有的花梁经过加固还可以利用，又节省了一百四十二吨钢材，并且可使改建主厂房的工程提前半年完成。原计划在一九五五年施工的电缆厂房（主厂房中的一个厂房），已提前在今年开工了。这样就可以提前安好新的机器设备。
