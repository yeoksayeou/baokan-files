    Rebuilding a New Life
    Bai Yuan
    Farmers from both banks of the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, who had been relocated due to the floods, are now returning to their hometowns to rebuild their new lives. In many places, the accumulated water has been drained, and the cultivated fields are already sprouting green wheat seedlings. On the road from Wuhu to Fanchang County, I met two returning farmers, one named Ding Yunpei and the other named Yang Xiuyuan. During the flood, they and the people of their village were settled by the government in Nanling County to engage in wasteland reclamation and production. Now, they are taking their wives and children from Nanling, passing through Fanchang, and returning to Wuwei County. When the flood hit, their houses were washed away, and many of their clothes and furniture were also swept away. Now, the government has helped them build houses in their hometown and has issued relief funds to help them with production. The village school also reopened in October. After returning to their hometown, they immediately prepared to participate in the dike restoration project. Yang Xiuyuan's twelve-year-old daughter walked along the road, calculating the lessons she needed to catch up on after returning to school. On a small river in Fanchang County, there was an old woman named Grandma Xue from Niuwangmiao Village, Andingwei, Fanchang County, who was visiting her daughter's home by boat after returning to her hometown. After the water receded in her hometown, the village organized an agricultural production cooperative, and wheat was planted in just a few days. Hearing that her son-in-law and daughter had also returned to their hometown, she took a small boat to visit them to see if they had joined the cooperative. The organized farmers demonstrated many moving deeds in the process of fighting the flood. The Ge Shiyu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fanchang County, when the flood came, built temporary thatched houses on the mountains, moved their families to the mountains, and collectively engaged in wasteland reclamation and production. Originally, the entire cooperative had only 276 mu of cultivated land, but they reclaimed another 310 mu, more than doubling their cultivated land. They have already harvested a total of over 35,400 jin of sweet potatoes, buckwheat, potatoes, and radishes on the land they reclaimed. Before the flood, 32 households participated in this cooperative; after the flood, it immediately expanded to 51 households. After the water receded, they repaired the houses that were washed away and collectively moved back to their original village from the mountains. Now, the cooperative has expanded from 51 households to 106 households. After the cooperative expanded, the director, Ge Shiyu, and the cadres in the cooperative studied how to strengthen leadership and better organize the cooperative's production.

    重建新生活
    白原
    安徽省长江两岸，因水灾迁移外地的农民，正在纷纷返乡重建新的生活。现在许多地方的积水已经排干，经过耕种的田地已经长出了青青的麦苗。在从芜湖到繁昌县的路上，我碰到两个返乡的农民，一个叫丁云培，一个叫杨修元。洪水期间，他们和乡里的人们一起由政府安置在南陵县进行开荒生产。现在他们带着妻子和儿女从南陵途经繁昌返回无为县。洪水泛滥的时候，他们的房子被冲倒，衣服，家具也冲走不少。现在政府已经帮助他们在家乡建起了房子，并且发了救济款帮助他们进行生产，乡里的学校也在十月里重新开学。他们返乡以后，马上就准备参加复堤工程。杨修元的一个十二岁的女孩一路走着，一路计算着她回到学校以后需要追赶的功课。在繁昌县的一条小河上，有一个在返乡以后坐小船到女儿家去探亲的薛老婆婆，家在繁昌县安定圩牛王庙村。家乡水退以后，因为乡里组织了农业生产合作社，几天的功夫就把麦子通通种下了，听说女婿和女儿也已经返乡，她就坐小船去看望，看看他们参加合作社没有。已经组织起来的农民，在这次和水灾作斗争的过程中出现了许多动人的事迹。繁昌县的一个葛世玉农业生产合作社，在洪水到来的时候，他们在山上搭起临时的草房，把家搬到山上集体进行开荒生产，原来全社只有耕地二百七十六亩，又开了三百一十亩，使他们的耕地扩大了一倍多。在他们所开垦的土地上已经得到收获的红薯、荞麦、马铃薯、萝卜共达三万五千四百多斤。在水灾以前，参加这个合作社的农民一共三十二户，水灾以后随即扩大到五十一户。水退以后，他们把被水冲毁的房子修建好，又集体从山上搬回了原来的村子。现在这个合作社又由五十一户扩大到一百零六户。合作社扩大以后，社长葛世玉就和社里的干部们研究怎样来加强领导和更好地组织合作社的生产。
