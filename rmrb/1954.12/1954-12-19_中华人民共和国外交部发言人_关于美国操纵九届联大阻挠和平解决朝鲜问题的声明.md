    Statement by Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
    Regarding U.S. Manipulation of the Ninth UN General Assembly to Obstruct Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue

    On December 11, 1954, at the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, under the manipulation of the United States and its followers, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and many other countries, and without the participation of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China in the discussion, a proposal put forward by the United States-led 15 nations involved in the Korean War was adopted. This proposal attempts to impose the will of the "United Nations Forces," one side of the Korean War, on the other side, blocking the path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This is yet another illegal resolution in a long series of illegal UN resolutions regarding the Korean issue. The Government and people of the People's Republic of China firmly oppose this illegal resolution.

    The Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports the statement made by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on December 11 regarding this matter.

    The resolution of the United Nations General Assembly approved the report of the 15 nations involved in the Korean War regarding the Geneva Conference on the Korean issue. In this report, the United States and its followers not only distorted the truth, attempting to shift the responsibility for the U.S. interruption of the Geneva Conference onto the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, but also absurdly put forward two so-called "basic principles" for resolving the Korean issue. These so-called principles actually mean that the United Nations, as one side of the war, should unilaterally decide the resolution of the Korean issue, and that the Korean people should abandon their legitimate right to prepare for and conduct national elections without external interference. This is a continuation of the attempt by the United States and its followers to impose the will of one side of the war on the other. The Geneva Conference has already shown that this approach is unreasonable and unworkable. The purpose of the United States and its followers in manipulating the United Nations to approve this approach is obviously to continue to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, maintain and exacerbate the unstable state of the Korean armistice, in order to deepen the tensions in the Far East. The passage of this resolution by the United Nations General Assembly once again branded the United Nations with the mark of one side of the Korean War, and once again proved that the United Nations has lost the qualification and moral strength to impartially handle the Korean issue. At the same time, under the manipulation of the United States and its followers, the United Nations General Assembly neither accepted our just accusation against the United States for invading our territory of Taiwan, nor rejected the legitimate suggestion put forward by the Soviet Union on "acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China and the responsibility of the U.S. Navy for these acts," but instead passed a shameful resolution condemning our sentencing of American spies. This is by no means accidental.

    At the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet Union, India, and other peace-loving countries made unremitting efforts to seek a way to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The Soviet delegation put forward a proposal to hold a meeting of relevant countries to discuss the Korean issue in the near future. This proposal is entirely reasonable. Everyone knows that the Geneva Conference on the Korean issue was interrupted solely due to the deliberate sabotage of the United States. But on the other hand, the agreements of the Geneva Conference on restoring peace in Indochina powerfully proved that the method of equal consultation among relevant countries is the correct way to peacefully resolve international disputes. Therefore, although this proposal by the Soviet Union was opposed by the United States and its followers, its rationality and correctness cannot be denied by anyone.

    The Korean issue cannot be left unresolved for a long time. Attempts to impose the will of one side on the other can only lead to war. The path to a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue should be to convene a conference of relevant countries, with the participation of neutral Asian countries, for consultation. All peace-loving countries and peoples cannot allow the United States to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue for a long time, and cannot sit idly by while the United States continues to create tensions and intensify the threat of war in the Far East. The People's Republic of China will, together with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving countries in the world, continue to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

### 中华人民共和国外交部发言人  关于美国操纵九届联大阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的声明

    中华人民共和国外交部发言人
    关于美国操纵九届联大阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的声明
    一九五四年十二月十一日，联合国大会第九届会议在美国和它的追随者的操纵下，不顾苏联和许多国家的反对，在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的代表参加讨论的情况下，通过了以美国为首的侵朝十五国所提出的提案，企图将朝鲜交战一方的联合国军的意志强加于另一方，堵塞和平解决朝鲜问题的道路。这是联合国关于朝鲜问题的一长串非法决议中的又一个非法决议。中华人民共和国政府和人民坚决反对这个非法决议。
    中华人民共和国政府完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人十二月十一日关于这个问题的声明。
    联合国大会的决议批准了侵朝十五国关于讨论朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议的报告。美国和它的追随者在这个报告中不仅颠倒是非，企图把美国中断日内瓦会议的责任推到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联的身上，而且极其荒谬地提出了所谓解决朝鲜问题的两项“基本原则”。这些所谓原则，实际上就是要由作为交战一方的联合国来独断朝鲜问题的解决，并且要求朝鲜人民放弃在不受外来干涉的情况下准备和进行全国选举的合法权利。这是美国和它的追随者继续企图把交战一方的意志强加于另一方的表现。日内瓦会议已经表明这种作法是不合理的，也是行不通的。美国和它的追随者操纵联合国批准了这种作法，其目的显然是要继续阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，保持和加剧朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，以加深远东的紧张局势。联合国大会通过这一决议就再一次给联合国盖上了朝鲜交战一方的烙印，并且又一次证明了联合国已经失去公正处理朝鲜问题的资格和道义力量。与此同时，联合国大会在美国和它的追随者的操纵之下，既不接受我国对美国侵略我国领土台湾的正义的控诉，又否决了苏联提出的“侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任”的正当建议，反而通过谴责我国判处美国间谍的可耻决议。这决不是偶然的。
    在联合国大会第九届会议上，苏联、印度和其他一些爱好和平的国家，为了寻求和平解决朝鲜问题的途径，曾作了不懈的努力。苏联代表团曾经提出在最近的将来举行有关国家讨论朝鲜问题的会议的建议。这个建议是完全合理的。大家知道，仅仅由于美国的蓄意破坏，讨论朝鲜问题的日内瓦会议才被中断。但是另一方面，日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议却有力地证明了由有关国家进行平等协商的方法是和平解决国际争端的正确途径。因此，苏联这一建议虽然遭受到美国和它的追随者的反对，它的合理性和正确性是任何人都抹煞不了的。
    朝鲜问题不能长期悬而不决。企图把一方的意志强加于另一方的办法只能导致战争。和平解决朝鲜问题的道路应该是召开由有关国家并有亚洲中立国家参加的会议进行协商。一切爱好和平的国家和人民不能容许美国长期阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，不能坐视美国在远东不断制造紧张局势和加强战争威胁。中华人民共和国将同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、苏联和世界上一切爱好和平的国家一起为和平解决朝鲜问题而继续奋斗。
                  一九五四年十二月十八日
