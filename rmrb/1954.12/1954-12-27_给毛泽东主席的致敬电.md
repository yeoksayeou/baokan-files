To our beloved Chairman Mao:

With extreme excitement, we report joyous news to you – our dear leader: the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways have simultaneously opened to traffic today! Here in Lhasa, the border city of our motherland, we are holding a warm and grand celebration rally. In this moment of jubilation and excitement, we first extend our highest respects to you – our beloved leader.

Over the past few years, under the immense care and leadership of the Central People's Government and you, with the enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country, the Han and Tibetan nationalities have united closely, and the military workers, technicians, and laborers have united tightly. From top to bottom, we have worked together with one heart and one mind, overcome numerous difficulties, and built the traffic arteries leading to the border areas – the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway. These highways will connect Tibet with the interior, providing important and favorable conditions for developing the economic and cultural undertakings of the Tibetan people, thereby also adding strength to the socialist construction of the motherland. The construction of these two highways embodies the great concern of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao for the Tibetan people and the Tibetan region. It demonstrates the spirit of friendship, unity, and mutual assistance among the various ethnic groups in our country, especially the Han and Tibetan nationalities, and further strengthens the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities, as well as the various ethnic groups in the Xikang, Qinghai, and Tibet regions. Therefore, as direct or indirect participants in this great socialist construction project, we all feel incomparably honored and joyful.

We are also clearly aware that the fundamental reason for achieving this victory is due to the kind concern and wise leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, the support of the people of the whole country and the Tibetan people, and the collective efforts of all those who participated wholeheartedly in the road construction project. During the long years of construction, throughout the entire process of achieving victory, we have learned two most precious lessons: if we want to win any victory, we must rely on the leadership of the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, and the Party, as well as the support of the people. The second is to rely on close unity.

Dear Chairman Mao, in these joyful days, we are even more clearly aware that the great socialist construction of the motherland is still very arduous, and the construction of the Tibetan region can only be regarded as a beginning. We must, under the leadership of the Communist Party, you, and the State Council of the People's Republic of China, with the support of the people of the whole country, and on the basis of existing victories, unite even more closely, make persistent efforts, and strive unremittingly to build a prosperous and happy Tibet!

Long live our great motherland!
Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all nationalities in China!
Long live the great unity of all fraternal nationalities in China!

    给毛泽东主席的致敬电亲爱的毛主席：
    我们以极端兴奋的心情，向您——我们亲爱的领袖报告喜讯：康藏、青藏两条公路在今天同时全线通车了。在祖国的边城——拉萨，我们正进行着热烈的、隆重的庆祝大会，在欢腾鼓舞之际，我们首先向您——我们亲爱的领袖致以崇高的敬礼。
    几年来，在中央人民政府和您的巨大关怀和领导下，在全国人民的热情支援下，汉、藏民族紧密地团结起来，军工、技工、民工紧密地团结起来，上下一致，同心合力，战胜了重重困难，修通了通向边疆的交通动脉——康藏公路和青藏公路。它将沟通西藏和内地的联系，使发展西藏民族的经济、文化事业获得重要的有利条件，从而对祖国的社会主义建设也增加了力量。这两条公路的修筑体现了中央人民政府和毛主席对西藏民族和西藏地区的巨大关怀，表现了我国各族人民特别是汉藏民族的友爱团结互助精神，并进一步加强汉、藏民族及西康、青海、西藏地区各民族的团结。因此，作为对这一伟大社会主义建设工程的直接或间接的参加者，我们都感到无比的光荣和欢欣。
    我们也清楚的知道：取得这一胜利的根本原因，是由于中央人民政府、毛主席的亲切关怀和英明领导，由于全国人民和藏族人民的支援，由于全力参加筑路工程的全体人员的集体努力，我们在漫长的施工岁月里，在整个取得胜利的过程中，我们体会到了两个最珍贵的道理：我们想赢得任何一个胜利，就必须依靠中央人民政府、毛主席及党的领导和人民的支援，第二是依靠紧密的团结。
    亲爱的毛主席，在这些欢乐的日子里，我们更清楚的知道：祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业还非常艰巨，西藏地区的建设事业也只能算是个开始。我们一定要在共产党、在您和中华人民共和国国务院的领导下，在全国人民的支援下，在现有胜利的基础上更加紧密地团结起来，再接再厉，为把西藏建设得繁荣幸福而奋斗不懈！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    中国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    中国各兄弟民族大团结万岁！
