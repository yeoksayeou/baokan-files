Rationalization Proposals

    The Railcars Carrying Oil Should Be Emptied Completely
    To the Editor:
    With the development of our country's large-scale economic construction, the need for petroleum is increasing day by day. There are two sources of oil: one is purchased from far away foreign countries, and the other is produced by our own factories and mines. Whether it is imported from abroad or produced by ourselves, it is the result of the hard work of the working people. However, many oil receiving units do not cherish state property enough and lack a strong sense of responsibility, so that the tank cars of the railway system that carry oil still have a lot of residual oil after each unloading. Generally, one or two large buckets can be scooped out of each empty car. Once, nineteen buckets were scooped out of one empty car, and in the most extreme case, half of the oil remained in the tank car. According to statistics, at the end of 1953 alone, 32 cars of residual oil, totaling more than 900 tons, were scooped out from 200 unloaded tank cars; from January to May 1954, more than 550 tons were scooped out, and now another 23 cars have accumulated. Because these oils are mixed with different types of oil, they are difficult to refine, resulting in great losses, and the railway is also difficult to handle.
    When the oil is unloaded, the cars are parked in a dedicated line, and railway personnel cannot enter. At the same time, because there is no anti-toxic equipment, the empty cars cannot be immediately entered for inspection after they leave the dedicated line. Only when the empty cars return to the loading station can they be washed and scooped out by technicians. In addition, there are no less than thirty or fifty oil transportation units across the country, so it is generally not easy to find out who the owner is. However, among the oil scooped out from January to May 1954, the Central Fuel Industry Ministry's Petroleum Administration Bureau and China Petroleum Company accounted for more than 200 tons, for which there are specific materials available.
    Because the oil loading stations spend a lot of effort and time scooping out these residual oils, it causes the occupation of railcars, seriously affecting vehicle turnover. On average, about 30 railcars are occupied every day at each loading station, and at most, 200 railcars are occupied, which affects the timely transport of imported oil.
    I think this loss is caused by the negligence of the staff who manage the oil depots towards state property. This loss is huge and cannot be tolerated. Oil is the blood of industry. Waste of oil will delay the progress of national industrial construction. I suggest that the National Supervisory Department conduct an inspection on this matter, urge them to establish a dedicated system for oil unloading, strengthen their sense of responsibility, and improve oil unloading equipment as much as possible, summarize and exchange advanced oil unloading experience, improve oil unloading technology, and prevent this kind of thing from continuing to happen.

    Editor's Note: Comrade Tang Jingzhen's opinion is correct. His letter has been forwarded to relevant departments for handling by this newspaper. According to the former Government Administration Council's People's Supervision Committee, which convened relevant units such as the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Petroleum Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry for research, the main reasons for the large amount of residual oil are that the oil receiving units lack the necessary sense of responsibility for state property; secondly, the time limits for unloading some oil are not completely reasonable, and some units have poor oil receiving equipment.
    In order to improve oil unloading work, the Supervisory Committee has the following suggestions: (1) All relevant units should conduct inspections of their affiliated oil receiving units, establish systems, strengthen the education of staff, improve oil unloading equipment as much as possible, and summarize and exchange experience in a timely manner to improve oil unloading technology; (2) The Ministry of Railways should study and adjust the oil unloading time based on the specific circumstances such as the type of oil, and negotiate with the oil receiving departments to resolve the issue; (3) In order to facilitate the investigation of responsibility for residual oil, the Ministry of Railways should implement the return card system and notify its affiliated oil receiving units to provide serious assistance. We believe these suggestions are very important, and we hope that all relevant units will implement them.

### 应该把装油料的车卸干净

专栏：合理化建议

    应该把装油料的车卸干净编辑同志：
    随着我国大规模经济建设的发展，石油的需要量一天天地增加。油料的来源有两个方面：一是购自千里迢迢的国外，一是我们自己的厂矿生产。不管是由国外运来的也好，我们自己生产的也好，都是劳动人民辛勤劳动的结晶。但是，很多接油单位，对国家财产不够爱护，工作责任心不强，以致铁路系统承运油料的油槽车，每次卸车后都剩有很多的残油。一般的每一辆空车可以掏出一两大桶，有一次一个空车掏出了十九桶，最多的还有一半油留在油车里。据统计：仅一九五三年年底从两百个卸后的油槽车内即掏出剩油三十二车，约计九百多吨；一九五四年一月至五月份又掏出五百五十多吨，现在又积累了二十三车。这些油料掏出后由于品种混杂不易提炼，损失很大，铁路方面也难于处理。
    油料卸车时停在专用线内，铁路人员不能进入，同时因无防毒设备，空车自专用线出来后，也不能立刻钻进去查看，只有等到空车返回装站时才由技术人员洗槽、掏出，加上全国运油单位不下三、五十个，所以一般不易查明货主是谁。但一九五四年一至五月份所掏出的油料中，有具体材料可查的，属于中央燃料工业部石油管理总局和中国石油公司的，共二百多吨。
    由于装油车站掏挖这些剩油时费力费时，造成车皮占压，严重地影响车辆周转。各装车站每天平均约有三十个车皮被占压，最多时达到二百多辆车皮，以致影响到进口油料不能及时接运。
    我认为这是管理油库人员对国家财产漫不经心所造成的损失。这种损失是巨大的，是不能容忍的。油料是工业的血液。浪费油料就会推迟国家工业建设的进展。我建议国家监察部门对此作一检查，督促他们建立卸油专责制度，加强责任心，并尽可能改善卸油设备，总结、交流卸油先进经验，提高卸油技术，防止这种事情的继续发生。
        铁道部车务局车流调整科　　唐景珍
    编者按：唐景珍同志的意见是正确的。他的来信经本报转请有关部门处理。据前政务院人民监察委员会召集铁道部、对外贸易部和燃料工业部石油管理总局等有关单位研究，造成大量剩油的主要原因，主要是各接油单位对国家资财缺乏应有的责任心；其次是有些油料卸车时间规定得不完全合理，有些单位接油设备较差。
    为了改进卸油工作，监察委员会有如下的建议：（一）各有关单位对所属接油单位进行检查，建立制度，加强对工作人员的教育，尽可能改善卸油设备，及时总结和交流经验，以提高卸油技术；（二）由铁道部根据油的类别等具体情况，研究调整卸油时间，和各接油部门协商解决；（三）为了便于查明剩余油料的责任，铁道部应贯彻执行回送卡片制度，并通知所属接油单位认真协助。我们认为这些建议很重要，务希各有关单位贯彻执行。
