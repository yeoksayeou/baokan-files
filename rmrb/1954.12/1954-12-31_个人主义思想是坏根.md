Individualism is a Bad Root

The case of Li Haishan, who was sentenced to prison for seriously violating labor discipline and causing damage to machinery, has been very educational for me. It has made me realize that to consolidate labor discipline, we must oppose bourgeois individualism and establish a correct view of labor.

The reason why Li Haishan caused a serious machine damage accident was that individualism was at work. He usually only considered personal gains and losses. If things went his way, his work would be good for two or three days; if things were slightly not to his liking, he would curse and scold, and his work would be passive. In the end, it developed into complete irresponsibility in his work, "trying to save trouble" and "showing off his heroism," which eventually led to the damage of the machine and the factory producing 82.395 fewer pieces of yarn. These yarns could be woven into more than 3,000 bolts of cloth, enough for more than 20,000 people to sew a set of clothes each. The state suffered a loss of more than 290 million yuan, and the loss of shortening the service life of the machine has not yet been calculated.

Recently, our factory conducted labor discipline education, and we also discussed the Li Haishan case again, and we further realized that the reason why some comrades do not abide by labor discipline is mainly due to the existence of individualism that only cares about the individual and not the whole, only cares about the present and not the long-term interests. Li Haishan went from being a member of the glorious working class to becoming a criminal against the state. This is an example. We also realize that in consolidating labor discipline, it is very important to carry out criticism and self-criticism frequently. In the future, we will not only abide by labor discipline ourselves, but also carry out mutual criticism and wage a resolute struggle against behavior that does not abide by labor discipline and against individualism.

I am the chairman of the trade union (without leaving production) of the Jia class in the sliver workshop, and Li Haishan is a worker in the Jia class. I used to help him, but he didn't accept it and even scolded people. I thought, "You work, and I work. I'll just do my own work well, why should I take your nonsense!" So I relaxed my help to him. Now I think, as a trade union chairman, I should unite all the comrades and do the whole production well. I should patiently help the comrades who are ideologically backward and not give up in the face of difficulties.

After the Li Haishan incident, the comrades in our class all examined their thoughts and gained a lot. The work has also been improved immediately. Zhang Gaonian, a sliver machine operator, originally thought that improving quality and eliminating accidents were the responsibility of the technical personnel and had nothing to do with himself. This time he realized that the reason why he produced waste products by stopping the car halfway was that he did not do a good job of cleaning according to the operating procedures. Therefore, he formulated a personal plan to overcome these shortcomings. Zhan Jianwu, an auxiliary worker, originally thought that it was enough to work for eight hours a day after entering the factory, but now he also realizes that the work must be done according to the operating procedures to be done well, and realizes that the administrative cadres are representing the state to direct the work, and must resolutely obey the command. He himself put forward a guarantee, and he did what he said. Sun Guohuan, an old worker who was originally unwilling to accept advanced experience, now also takes the initiative to learn from others the advanced methods of improving the quality of lap. Hu Bingyuan, a sliver machine operator who originally did not work according to the operating procedures, now also works according to the operating procedures, and is very enthusiastic about his work. Our Jia class has had no major accidents since November.

    个人主义思想是坏根

    李海山严重违反劳动纪律、造成机器损坏、被判徒刑的案件，对我的教育意义很大。它使我认识到：要巩固劳动纪律，就必须反对资产阶级的个人主义思想，树立正确的劳动观点。
    李海山造成严重损坏机器事故的原因，就是个人主义思想作怪。他平日只考虑个人得失，事情能顺他的意，他的工作便好两三天；事情稍一不如他的意，他就通七骂八，工作消极。最后竟发展到工作完全不负责任，“图省事”，“逞英雄”，结果终于使机器损坏，使工厂少生产八十二点三九五件纱。这些纱可以织成三千多匹布，供两万多人每人缝一套衣服。国家损失达二亿九千多万元，机器使用年限缩短的损失还没有计算在内。
    最近，我们工厂进行劳动纪律教育，我们又对李海山案件进行了讨论，更认识到了有些同志不守劳动纪律，主要就是存在着只顾个人，不顾整体，只顾目前，不顾长远利益的个人主义思想。李海山由光荣的工人阶级的一分子，变成了国家的罪人，这就是一个例子。我们也认识到：在巩固劳动纪律中，经常地开展批评和自我批评是非常重要的。今后我们不但要自己遵守劳动纪律，还要开展相互的批评，同不遵守劳动纪律的行为，同个人主义思想作坚决斗争。
    我是清花车间甲班的工会主席（不脱离生产的），李海山是甲班的工人。我过去也曾经帮助过他，但他不接受，还骂人，我就想：“你做工，我也做工，我把自己的活干好算了，何必受你的闲气！”对他的帮助也就放松了，现在想来，作为一个工会主席，我应该团结全体同志，把整个生产作好，对思想落后的同志应当耐心地帮助，不能在困难面前低头。
    李海山事件发生后，我们班上的同志都检查了思想，有很大收获，工作也立即有了改进。清花机值车工张高年，原来认为提高质量与消灭事故是技术人员的事，与自己不相干。这次他认识到：中途阻车出废品，就是自己没按操作规程把清洁工作作好。于是，他订出了克服这些毛病的个人计划。辅助工詹建武，原来认为一天进厂作八小时完事，现在也认识到工作必须按操作规程进行才能作好，认识到行政干部是代表国家来指挥工作的，必须坚决服从指挥。他自己提出保证，并且说到就做到了。原来不肯接受先进经验的老工人孙国焕，现在也主动向别人学习提高花卷质量的先进方法。原来不按操作规程工作的清花机值车工胡炳元，现在也按操作规程工作，工作劲头还很大。我们甲班从十一月份以来就没出重大事故。
