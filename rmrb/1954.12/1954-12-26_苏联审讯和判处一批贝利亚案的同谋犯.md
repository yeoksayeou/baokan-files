Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 24th: TASS reports from Moscow on December 24th: The Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union held a public trial in Leningrad from December 14th to 19th, trying the criminal case of the following defendants: former Minister of the Soviet State Security Department V.S. Abakumov, former Chief of the Major Cases Investigation Department of the Soviet State Security Department A.G. Leonov, Deputy Chiefs of the Major Cases Investigation Department of the Soviet State Security Department V.I. Komarov and M.T. Likhachev, and staff members of the Soviet State Security Department I.A. Chernov and Ya.M. Broverman.

The trial determined that defendant Abakumov was promoted to the position of Minister of the Soviet Security Department by Beria, and he was a direct accomplice of Beria's criminal conspiracy group. He carried out the tasks assigned to him by Beria against the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

Abakumov and Beria committed the same crimes, embarking on the path of adventurism and political provocation. Abakumov fabricated cases, falsely accused some staff members of Party organizations and Soviet organs, and representatives of intellectuals, then arrested them, using heinous investigation methods prohibited by Soviet law, and together with his accomplices Leonov, Komarov, and Likhachev, attempted to obtain fabricated evidence from the arrested persons, forcing them to confess to serious crimes of treason.

Abakumov fabricated the so-called "Leningrad Affair" in this way, according to which several staff members of Party and Soviet organs were arrested without any basis, falsely accusing them of the most serious crimes against the state.

The trial also confirmed many other facts of Abakumov and his accomplices fabricating criminal cases and heinously trampling on the socialist legal system.

Those who were falsely accused by Abakumov and his accomplices have now been completely rehabilitated.

In order to cover up his crimes, Abakumov forbade the statements and appeals of the arrested persons to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government from being forwarded.

The Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union considered that the charges against Abakumov and his accomplices were completely true, and sentenced the defendants Abakumov, Leonov, Komarov, and Likhachev to the supreme penalty - execution by firing squad. The remaining defendants were sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen to twenty-five years, with labor reform.

The sentences have been carried out.

    苏联审讯和判处一批贝利亚案的同谋犯
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：苏联最高法院军事庭，十二月十四日到十九日在列宁格勒举行公审，审理了下列被告的刑事案件：前苏联国家保安部部长瓦·斯·阿巴库莫夫、前苏联国家保安部要案侦察处处长阿·格·列昂诺夫、前苏联国家保安部要案侦察处副处长维·伊·科马罗夫和麦·特·利哈切夫、前苏联国家保安部工作人员伊·阿·契尔诺夫、雅·麦·布罗维尔曼。
    审讯确定：被告阿巴库莫夫是由贝利亚提拔到苏联保安部部长的职位的，他是贝利亚罪恶的阴谋集团的直接同谋者。他执行贝利亚所交给的反对共产党和苏联政府的任务。
    阿巴库莫夫和贝利亚犯了同样的罪行，走上了冒险和政治挑衅的道路。阿巴库莫夫捏造案件，诬告党组织和苏维埃机关的一些工作人员和知识分子代表人物，然后逮捕他们，采用为苏维埃法律所禁止的罪恶的侦查方法，和他的同谋者列昂诺夫、科马罗夫、利哈切夫一道，企图从被捕者身上得到捏造的证据，强迫被捕者供认自己犯有严重的叛国罪。
    阿巴库莫夫用这种办法捏造了所谓“列宁格勒案件”，按照这个案件，毫无根据地逮捕了党和苏维埃机关的若干工作人员，诬告他们对国家犯了最严重的罪行。
    审讯还证实了阿巴库莫夫和他的同谋者捏造刑事案件和罪恶地践踏社会主义法律制度的其他许多事实。
    现在，被阿巴库莫夫和他的同谋者所诬告的人已完全恢复名誉。
    为了掩盖他的罪行，阿巴库莫夫禁止将被捕者给苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的声明和申诉转达上去。
    苏联最高法院军事庭认为，阿巴库莫夫和他的同谋者的罪状完全属实，判决被告阿巴库莫夫、列昂诺夫、科马罗夫、利哈切夫极刑——枪决。其余被告被判处十五年到二十五年有期徒刑，实行劳动改造。
    判决已经执行。
