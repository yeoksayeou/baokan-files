Visiting the Home of "Peking Man" – Zhoukoudian
By our reporter Bai Sheng

December 2nd of this year marked the 25th anniversary of the discovery of the first skull of "Peking Man." At the invitation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, we visited Zhoukoudian, the home of "Peking Man," about 54 kilometers southwest of Beijing, on December 22nd.

We set off a little after eight in the morning, and arrived at Zhoukoudian around noon, when snowflakes had already begun to fall. Amidst the cold wind and snow, we climbed the precious mountain known locally as "Dragon Bone Hill" – a world-renowned site for fossil hominids. It was on this beautiful land that our human ancestors, half a million years ago, conquered nature with their labor and wisdom, and created the earliest human culture.

Accompanied by Comrade Liu Xianting from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the old worker Liu Yishan, who participated in the excavation of the first "Peking Man" skull, we first visited the "Peking Man" Site Exhibition Room. This exhibition room was established in September of last year. Its establishment demonstrates the care and attention of our Party and state to scientific and cultural undertakings. The materials displayed here are powerful evidence of the evolution of humans from apes. The exhibition room is divided into three parts. The first part is the fossil models and cultures of "Peking Man" of 500,000 years ago and "Upper Cave Man" of 50,000 to 60,000 years ago. Here, we first see the skull model of "Peking Man" and the stone tools used by "Peking Man"; we can also see many stones and animal bones that have been burned by fire, which are the remains of "Peking Man's" use of fire. Next are the bone, stone, and shell ornaments used by "Upper Cave Man," as well as bone needles ground from animal bones. Here, every simple primitive tool is the result of the labor and wisdom of our human ancestors, and every advance in tools marks a milestone in human evolution. These rich fossil materials also powerfully tell people the history of labor creating humanity. On display here are the fossil models of "Peking Man" discovered after liberation (the original specimens are preserved in the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences), including a section of humerus shaft, a section of tibia shaft, and five teeth. When people visit here, they think of the skulls and other specimens of "Peking Man" and "Upper Cave Man" that were looted and stolen by imperialists, which arouses infinite indignation in everyone.

The second part of the exhibition room is the fossil material of the animal groups contemporary with "Peking Man" and "Upper Cave Man." Here, we can see various animal fossils excavated from the "Peking Man" site; the vertebrate fossils are particularly rich, including many that have long been extinct, such as saber-toothed tigers and Merck's rhinoceros. "Peking Man" had arduous struggles with these fierce beasts, while also hunting animals such as water buffalo and deer. These animal group fossil materials can help us understand that the geographical environment near Zhoukoudian 500,000 years ago was different from what it is now. According to paleontologists, the climate in Zhoukoudian at that time was warmer and more humid than it is now, similar to southern China; there may have been grasslands and vast forests nearby. Most of the animals that lived at the same time as "Upper Cave Man" are species that still exist today.

The third part of the exhibition is animal fossils excavated from other locations near the "Peking Man" site. Among them are the skeleton of the Chinese hyena, the horns of the giant deer and sika deer, the complete skull of a rhinoceros, and fish fossils. According to paleontologists, these animal fossils are very old. For example, the fish fossils displayed on the wall are more than five million years old. These fish fossils still appear lifelike, maintaining their respective swimming postures.

After visiting the exhibition room, we visited the excavation sites of "Peking Man" and "Upper Cave Man." Old worker Liu Yishan, who is nearly sixty years old, led us to the "Peking Man" site; the top of the cave no longer exists, but most of the cave walls are still preserved. He pointed to a small cave entrance that had been filled in and told us that at four o'clock in the afternoon on December 2, 1929, as the sun was about to set, the light near the cave entrance gradually dimmed, and the weather was unusually cold, the workers excavated the first complete "Peking Man" skull here.

Then we visited the excavation sites after liberation. The guide told everyone that in September 1949, with the support of our Party and government, the excavation work of "Peking Man," which had been suspended for twelve years, was resumed. On the third day after the start of work, three teeth of "Peking Man" were discovered. In 1951, two more teeth were excavated. In the same year, a section of the lower part of the tibia shaft of "Peking Man" and a section of the humerus shaft of "Peking Man" were discovered from accumulated bone fragments. Part of this humerus had turned black due to being burned by fire; part had turned bluish-gray. Currently, this site has been excavated to a depth of 34 meters, and in addition to the remains of "Peking Man," many stone tools and animal fossils have been discovered.

We walked around the hillside and visited some of the excavation sites, then climbed to Upper Cave. This cave is at the highest part of the "Peking Man" site and is connected to the cave where "Peking Man" lived. This cave originally had a roof, but it was demolished during excavation due to fragmentation. Here, three complete skulls and part of the trunk bones of "Upper Cave Man," who lived 50,000 to 60,000 years ago, were excavated. At the same time, many good bone tools, such as bone needles and polished antlers, were also found in the Upper Cave deposits; many ornaments were also found, such as drilled small pebbles, small stone beads, and perforated canine teeth of foxes and badgers, and perforated sea clam shells. Fewer stone tools were found. In addition, many animal fossils were found in Upper Cave, of which rabbit fossils were the most abundant.

When we stood at the highest point of "Upper Cave," looking down the mountain amidst the flying snowflakes, we saw workers at the foot of the mountain working hard at the train station, carrying lime. In the distance, the lime kiln was emitting wisps of white smoke. This beautiful picture reveals our future: creating a better life with our own labor! (Attached picture)

    访“中国猿人”之家——周口店
    本报记者　柏生
    今年十二月二日是“中国猿人”第一个头盖骨发现的二十五周年纪念日。在中国科学院的邀请下，我们在十二月二十二日访问了北京西南约五十四公里的周口店——“中国猿人”之家。
    早晨八点多钟出发，午间到达周口店时，天空已飘起了雪花。在寒风和雪花中，我们爬上了被当地人民称做“龙骨山”的宝山——它是世界著名的化石人类产地。就在这片美好的土地上，我们人类的祖先，五十万年以前用自己的劳动和智慧征服着自然，创造了人类最早的文化。
    我们随同中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室的刘宪亭同志和曾参加“中国猿人”第一个头盖骨发掘工作的老工人刘义山，首先参观了“中国猿人”产地陈列室。这个陈列室是在去年九月建立起来的。它的建立，说明了我们的党和国家对科学文化事业的关怀和重视。这里陈列的材料是人类从猿演变来的一个有力证据。陈列室分三部分。第一部分是五十万年前的“中国猿人”和五、六万年前的“山顶洞人”化石模型和他们的文化。这里，我们首先看到的是“中国猿人”的头骨模型和“中国猿人”使用的生产工具——石器；还可看到被火燃烧过的许多石块和兽骨，这是“中国猿人”用火的遗迹。接下去是“山顶洞人”使用的骨制、石制和介壳制的装饰品，以及用兽骨磨成的骨针。这里，每一件简单的原始工具，都是我们人类祖先的劳动成果和智慧的结晶，每一件工具的进步，都标志着人类进化的里程。这些丰富的化石材料，也有力地告诉人们劳动创造人类的历史。这里陈列的有解放后发现的“中国猿人”化石模型（原标本保存在中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室），包括肱骨干一段，胫骨干一段和牙齿五个。当人们在这里参观时，就联想到被帝国主义抢劫和盗窃的“中国猿人”和“山顶洞人”的头骨等标本，这使每一个人激起无限愤慨的心情。
    陈列室的第二部分是和“中国猿人”、“山顶洞人”同时期的动物群化石材料。这里，我们可以看到从“中国猿人”产地发掘出来的各种动物化石；特别是脊椎动物化石，尤为丰富，其中有许多早已绝了种，如剑齿虎、梅氏犀牛等。“中国猿人”曾和这些凶猛的兽类作过艰险的斗争，同时把水牛、鹿类等动物作为猎取的对象。这些动物群化石材料，可以帮助我们了解，五十万年前周口店附近地方的地理环境是和现在不同的。据古生物学家们的研究，当时周口店的气候，比现在要温暖湿润，有如现在中国的南部；附近可能有草原和广阔的森林。和“山顶洞人”同时期生存过的动物，大多是现在还生存着的种类。
    陈列的第三部分，是“中国猿人”产地附近的其他地点发掘的动物化石。其中有中国鬣狗的骨架、肿骨鹿和斑鹿的犄角、完整的犀牛的头骨，以及鱼化石等。据古生物学家说，这些动物化石的年代已很久远。如陈列在壁上的鱼化石已在五百万年以上了。这些鱼化石，看来仍栩栩如生，保持着各自的游水姿态。
    参观陈列室以后，我们又访问了“中国猿人”和“山顶洞人”的发掘地点。年近六十岁的刘义山老工人引我们到“中国猿人”产地；这里洞顶已经不存在了，但洞壁大部分还保存着。他指着一个已经被填了的小洞口告诉我们说，一九二九年十二月二日下午四点钟，太阳快要落山，洞口附近光线慢慢地暗下来，天气又异常的寒冷，工人们就在这里挖掘出第一个完整的“中国猿人”头盖骨来。
    接着我们又到解放以后的发掘地点参观。向导同志告诉大家，一九四九年九月，在我们党和政府的支持下，恢复了停止十二年之久的“中国猿人”发掘工作。在开工后的第三天，就发现了“中国猿人”的三个牙齿。一九五一年又发掘出两个牙齿。同年又由积存的碎骨中发现了“中国猿人”的胫骨干下部的一段，和“中国猿人”的肱骨干一段，这段肱骨由于受到火的焚烧，一部分已变成黑色；一部分变成灰蓝色。现在，这个地点已发掘到三十四公尺深，除掘获“中国猿人”的骸骨外，还发现了许多石器和动物的化石。
    我们绕着山坡转了一圈，参观了一部分发掘地点后，攀上了山顶洞。这个洞在“中国猿人”产地的最上部，和“中国猿人”居住的洞穴互相连接。这个洞穴原来是有洞顶的，后因破碎，便在发掘时拆除了。在这里，曾经发掘出距今五、六万年前的“山顶洞人”的三个完整的头骨和一部分躯干骨。同时由山顶洞堆积中还发现了许多很好的骨器，如骨针和磨光的鹿角等；还发现有许多装饰品，如钻孔的小砾石、小石珠和穿孔的狐、獾的犬齿，穿孔的海蚶壳等。石器则发现的比较少。此外，在山顶洞还发现许多动物化石，其中以兔化石最丰富。
    当我们站在“山顶洞”的最高处，在雪花飞舞中向山下眺望时，看到山脚下工人们正在火车站上紧张地劳动，搬运石灰。远处，石灰窑正冒着一缕缕的白烟。这个美丽的图景，揭示了我们的未来：以自己的劳动创造更美满的生活！（附图片）
