The neighborhood committees and street offices in cities have been piloted in cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin since 1951. In the past two years, especially after the Second National Civil Affairs Conference last year passed the resolution on establishing and rectifying neighborhood committees and street offices, more than 80 cities in 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country have established these two types of organizations, or one of them. Some cities are currently working on establishing them.

In cities where neighborhood committees have been established, the overlapping organizations, busy work, and excessive burden on street activists in the past have been changed. In the past, due to the lack of unified organizations for urban street residents, urban district authorities arbitrarily assigned work to street residents, resulting in many organizations, many meetings, and many concurrent positions for street activists. In some cities, there were as many as 37 such complex organizations in the streets. Street activists often held several or even more than a dozen positions, attending meetings every day, sometimes several a day. This affected the production and life of activists and the normal development of various urban tasks. The establishment of neighborhood committees effectively changed this situation. In the process of establishing neighborhood committees, various cities have abolished or merged some inappropriate organizations, overcoming the "five excessive" phenomena in the streets. After Tianjin established street neighborhood committees, the number of organizations among street residents was reduced from more than 20 to three. The number of meetings attended by Yu Huangmiao activists in the city has been reduced from 20 times per month to about four times. After Xuzhou established neighborhood committees, activists holding concurrent street positions accounted for only 5 percent of all activists. After the South Sanjing Road in the Southern District of Shenyang rectified its street organizations, the number of street activists increased by 78. Now, among the more than 200 neighborhood committee members and residents group leaders in the entire street, only one person holds three positions, and more than 20 people hold two positions (committee members also serving as group leaders), basically achieving one person per position.

As street work became more orderly, neighborhood committees played a significant role in solving residents' living and welfare issues. For example, Jinjia Lane in Shanghai did not have electric lights in the past, and residents' lives were very inconvenient. After the neighborhood committee was established, it borrowed money from the bank to install 702 electric lights. The neighborhood committee of Qianda Road Street in Baotou registered all vacant houses in its jurisdiction and persuaded landlords to give priority to renting to workers from all over the country who came to participate in industrial construction. The neighborhood committee of Guanfangzi Street in the city organized residents to help single workers with washing, mending, and sewing clothes, which not only boosted the production enthusiasm of single workers but also increased residents' income. Neighborhood committees have also been remarkably effective in organizing residents to respond to government calls and promote various tasks. For example, in the early stages of implementing planned supply of grain and edible oil in Tianjin and unified sales of cotton cloth in Xi'an, the supply work was carried out in an orderly manner due to the timely publicity and education work of the neighborhood committees. Neighborhood committees in industrial and mining cities have also played an active role in mobilizing workers' families to ensure workers' attendance rates and educating residents to love factories and mines and support industrial production in various ways. The Guxi Neighborhood Committee in Fuzhou has mediated more than 590 marriage, debt, housing, and other disputes among residents in the past three years, which not only helped the government's work but also greatly strengthened the unity among residents.

The advantage of establishing street offices in cities is that it strengthens the leadership of the city or municipal district over street work and further strengthens the ties between the government and the people. After many cities established street offices, the municipal or municipal district people's government, having its own dispatched agencies in the streets, can uniformly study and deploy various tasks related to residents through the joint meetings of street office directors, overcoming the phenomenon that work was not easy to go deep in the past, and improving the quality and efficiency of the work. When the Beitanmiao Street Office in the first district of Chongqing carried out relief work, it explained the policies from top to bottom, so that the policies were grasped by the masses, and the evaluation of relief funds was more detailed and reasonable than in the past. Six poor people who received relief, because they understood the government's relief policies, voluntarily proposed to overcome difficulties and not ask for relief. Many cities have facilitated the masses and solved problems for the masses in a timely manner because of the establishment of street offices. For example, in the past, when people in Beitanmiao Street, Chongqing, went to the civil affairs cadre to register for marriage, it often happened that no one was in charge because the civil affairs cadre was out on business, and some people ran back and forth seven times. After the establishment of the street office, the cadres had a clear division of labor and established a certain system. People generally have someone to receive them when they come to the office for business. Residents don't have to run around and don't have to queue, and they can quickly get things done.

Rectifying street residents' organizations is a complex task. According to local experience, the following matters must be paid attention to when establishing neighborhood committees in cities.

First, it is necessary to rely on the working people and pay attention to absorbing women's participation. The social situation in urban streets is extremely complex, and the objects of street work are mainly some unemployed and scattered urban residents, who are the consumer population in the city. The neighborhood committee must be able to undertake the task of organizing and educating these people, so that they gradually transfer to production and play a certain role in the socialist construction cause. Therefore, when rectifying and establishing street residents' organizations, it is necessary to rely on the working people (mainly the families of workers) and absorb upright unemployed people, intellectuals, freelancers, small vendors, etc., to ensure that they can undertake the task of educating residents. Since women are the main object of street work, and most of them are relatively pure, some of them have a certain level of education and work ability, and most of them want to participate in social activities through street organizations and do something for the masses, and they also have more time, which is beneficial to participating in street work. Therefore, this group of forces should never be ignored. In the work of rectifying and establishing neighborhood committees, it is necessary to cultivate and educate them and absorb them into the work.

Second, neighborhood committee members should try to hold one position per person, and the area under the jurisdiction of the neighborhood committee should be small rather than large. If neighborhood committee members do not hold concurrent positions or hold fewer concurrent positions, it not only gives the members time to take care of their own production and life, which is good for their study and health, enabling them to concentrate their efforts on doing one or two things well in a period of time, but also allows street residents' work to absorb more people to participate and cultivate more activists. Urban residents often have no direct connection in production and occupation, and are mostly unfamiliar with each other, and people of all classes live together, with different living conditions and welfare requirements. Therefore, organizing small neighborhood committees facilitates mutual understanding among residents, makes it easy to meet common welfare requirements, and also facilitates the activities of neighborhood committee members and activists. According to local experience, the organizational scope of neighborhood committees is generally appropriate for around 300 households, some can be 100 or 200 households, and special streets that are inconvenient to divide can be appropriately expanded, but should not exceed 600 households.

Third, give full play to democracy, raise residents' awareness, and do a good job in the election of neighborhood committees. Before the establishment of neighborhood committees, it is necessary to publicize to the masses the significance of rectifying street work, the nature and tasks of neighborhood committees, and conduct publicity and education to residents, so that residents can enthusiastically care about the establishment of neighborhood committees and their subsequent work, and actively participate in the election of neighborhood committees. After the neighborhood committee is established, the welfare requirements of the masses should be met as quickly as possible, according to the needs and possibilities, to establish the prestige of the neighborhood committee and make residents more concerned about the activities of the neighborhood committee.

    在城市建立居民委员会和街道办事处的情况和经验
    城市居民委员会和街道办事处这两种组织，从一九五一年起即先后在上海和天津等城市开始试行建立；近两年来，尤其是在去年第二次全国民政会议通过关于建立与整顿居民委员会和街道办事处的决议以后，全国已有二十二个省、市、自治区的八十多个城市建立起这两种组织或者其中的一种组织。还有些城市目前正在着手建立。
    已经成立居民委员会的城市，街道中过去组织重叠，工作忙乱，街道积极分子负担过重的情况改变了。过去由于城市街道居民没有统一的组织，市区机关随意在街道居民中布置工作，造成了街道中组织多、会议多、积极分子兼职多的现象。有的城市，街道中这种繁杂组织达到三十七种之多。街道积极分子多是身兼数职或是十多职，天天开会，甚至一天开几个会。这就影响了积极分子的生产和生活，也影响了城市各种工作的正常开展。居民委员会的建立有效地改变了这种状况。各城市在建立居民委员会的过程中，把一些不适当的组织都加以撤销或者合并，克服了街道中的“五多”现象。天津市建立街道居民委员会以后，街道居民中的组织，由过去的二十多种减少到三种。该市玉皇庙积极分子从每月开会二十次减少至四次左右。徐州市建立居民委员会以后，兼职的街道积极分子只占全体积极分子的百分之五。沈阳南市区南三经路整顿街道组织之后，街道积极分子增多了七十八名，现在全街二百多名居民委员会委员、居民组长中，兼三职的只有一人，兼二职的（委员兼组长）二十余人，基本上达到一人一职。
    由于街道工作有了秩序，居民委员会在解决居民生活福利方面起了很大的作用。如上海市金家巷过去没有电灯，居民生活很不方便，居民委员会建立后，向银行贷款安装了电灯七百零二盏。包头市前大路街居民委员会曾登记管辖区内所有的空房，说服房主优先租给由全国各地前来参加工业建设的职工居住。该市官房子街居民委员会组织居民帮助单身职工拆洗缝补衣服，不仅鼓舞了单身职工的生产情绪，并且使居民增加了收入。居民委员会在组织居民响应政府号召，推行各项工作方面也有显著成效。如天津市在实行粮食和食油计划供应初期，西安市在实行棉布统销工作初期，都由于居民委员会及时对群众进行了宣传教育工作，保证了供应工作有条不紊地进行。工矿城市的居民委员会在动员职工家属保证职工出勤率，教育居民热爱厂矿、从各方面支援工业生产等方面，也都起了积极的作用。福州市鼓西居民委员会三年来共调解居民群众中的婚姻、债务、房屋等纠纷五百九十多起，不仅帮助了政府的工作，而且大大加强了居民之间的团结。
    在城市设立街道办事处的好处，是加强了市或市辖区对街道工作的领导，进一步密切了政府和人民群众的联系。许多城市设立街道办事处以后，市或市辖区人民政府由于在街道中有了自己的派出机关，可以经由街道办事处主任联席会议来统一研究和部署有关居民的各项工作，克服了过去工作不易深入的现象，使工作的质量和效率都有了提高。重庆市第一区北坛庙街道办事处在进行救济工作时，自上而下地交代政策，使政策为群众所掌握，救济金的评议较过去更加细致而合理，有六个受救济的贫民，因为了解了政府的救济政策，自动提出克服困难，不要救济。许多城市由于设立了街道办事处，便利了群众，及时为群众解决了问题。如重庆市北坛庙街过去群众找民政干事办理婚姻登记，常常因为民政干事因事外出，无人负责，有的前后跑了七次。街道办事处设立后，干部有了明确分工，建立了一定的制度，群众有事到办事处，一般都有人接待，居民们不要跑腿，不要排队，就很快把事情办了。
    整顿街道居民组织，是一项复杂的工作，根据各地的经验，在城市建立居民委员会，必须注意下列事项。
    第一、要依靠劳动人民，并注意吸收妇女参加。城市街道中的社会情况异常复杂，街道工作的对象主要是一些无业散居的市民，他们是城市中的消费人口。居民委员会必须能够担负起对这些人进行组织和教育的任务，使他们逐渐转入生产，在社会主义建设事业中发挥一定的力量。因此，在整顿和建立街道居民组织时，就必须依靠劳动人民（主要是职工家属），并吸收为人正派的失业人员、知识分子、自由职业者、小商摊贩等参加，以保证能够担负教育居民的任务。由于妇女是街道工作的主要对象，她们当中又大部分比较纯洁，有一部分并有一定的文化水平和工作能力，她们多数都想通过街道组织参加社会活动，为群众办些事情，而且时间也较充裕，具有参加街道工作的有利条件。因此对于这批力量决不应该忽视，在整顿和建立居民委员会的工作中，必须培养教育并吸收她们参加到工作中来。
    第二、居民委员会委员应当尽量做到一人一职，居民委员会所辖地区范围则宜小不宜大。居民委员会委员不兼职或少兼职，不但使委员有时间照顾自己的生产和生活，对他们的学习和健康都有好处，使他们能够在一个时期集中力量办好一件或两件事情，同时，街道居民工作也可以吸收更多的人来参加，培养更多的积极分子。城市居民多无生产和职业上的直接联系，彼此多不熟悉，而且各阶层杂居，生活条件和福利要求也不同，因此，组织小型的居民委员会，就便于居民互相了解，容易满足共同的福利要求，也便于居民委员会委员和积极分子进行活动。根据各地经验，居民委员会的组织范围一般在三百户左右较为适宜，有的可以一、二百户，少数不便划分的特殊街道可以适当扩大，但也不宜超过六百户。
    第三、充分发扬民主，提高居民觉悟，做好居民委员会的选举工作。在建立居民委员会以前，应当向群众宣传整顿街道工作的意义，居民委员会的性质和任务，向居民进行宣传教育，使居民能够热情关怀居民委员会的建立和以后的工作，能够积极参加居民委员会的选举。在居民委员会成立以后，对于群众提出的生活福利要求，应当按照需要与可能，能解决的迅速求得解决，以树立居民委员会的威信，使居民更加关心居民委员会的活动。
