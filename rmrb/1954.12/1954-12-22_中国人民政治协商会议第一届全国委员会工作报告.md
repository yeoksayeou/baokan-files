Work Report of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

Vice Chairman of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chen Shutong

Chairman, fellow members:

I am entrusted by the Standing Committee of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to present the Work Report of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held its first plenary session in September 1949, exercised the functions and powers of the National People's Congress, formulated the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, elected the Central People's Government Committee, and announced the establishment of the People's Republic of China. At the same time, the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was elected. Over the past few years, our country has victoriously carried out great struggles such as reforming the land system, resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, restoring the national economy, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, and ideological remolding. The level of awareness and organization of the people of the whole country has been greatly improved, and the people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party of China has become increasingly consolidated. Based on this series of great victories, the system of People's Congresses with universal suffrage was implemented, replacing the transitional form of the plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercising the functions and powers of the National People's Congress and the people's representative conferences of all circles in local areas exercising the functions and powers of the local People's Congresses. The First Session of the First National People's Congress, with great historical significance, formulated a great epoch-making constitution, which became "a milestone marking the new victories and new developments of our people since the founding of the country in 1949." During this period, the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, has worked in the aforementioned people's undertakings and played an important role. A brief report is as follows.

I. Mobilize and unite the people of the whole country to oppose US imperialist aggression, defend the security of the motherland, and defend world peace. When US imperialism launched a war of aggression in Korea, fought to our border, and occupied our territory of Taiwan, the CPPCC, in accordance with the demands of the broad masses of the people, consulted with various democratic parties and issued the "Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties" on November 4, 1950, launching the great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. Subsequently, the CPPCC repeatedly issued appeals jointly with various democratic parties and people's organizations, such as the declaration commemorating the sixth anniversary of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, protests against the US imperialist bacteriological warfare, and statements against the illegal resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly on the Korean issue, in order to promote the development of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. At the same time, through various democratic parties, people's organizations, and provincial and municipal consultation committees, all parties were mobilized to participate in various activities to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and three work groups were organized with the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to go to Korea for condolences. At the Third and Fourth Sessions of the First National Committee, resolutions were passed successively, calling on the people of the whole country to continue to strengthen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The people of the whole country responded to the above-mentioned appeals with various practical actions and enthusiastically participated in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea. The widespread and in-depth development of the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea inspired the spirit of patriotism and internationalism of the people of the whole country, shattered the pro-US, worship-US, and fear-US thoughts left in some people, strengthened the unity of the people of the whole country, and greatly consolidated and developed the people's democratic united front. When the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina have been successfully realized, US imperialism is unwilling to fail, continues to occupy our territory of Taiwan, and intensifies its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in an attempt to expand its armed intervention and war threats against our country, and continues to create international tensions. In response to this situation, the CPPCC, in consultation with various democratic parties and people's organizations, issued a joint declaration on August 22, 1954, for the liberation of Taiwan, expressing the firm and unwavering will of the people of the whole country to liberate Taiwan. In order to safeguard world peace and promote international cooperation, the CPPCC successively adopted measures calling on the people of the whole country to launch a signature campaign to defend world peace, resolutions supporting the demand for the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers, and resolutions supporting the various demands of the World People's Peace Congress. These appeals have also been warmly responded to by the people of the whole country. The number of people who signed the declaration for the conclusion of a peace treaty alone reached more than 344 million. In order to develop and consolidate the strong foundation of world peace—the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union—the CPPCC, on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, mobilized and organized people from all walks of life through various democratic parties, people's organizations, and provincial and municipal consultation committees to participate in the various tasks of the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" launched by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and carried out activities to learn from the Soviet Union. In order to express deep concern for the People's Liberation Army that defends the security of the motherland and world peace, the CPPCC, together with the Chinese People's Committee to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, organized work to express condolences to the People's Liberation Army.

II. Assist the government in mobilizing the people to carry out various revolutionary movements and construction undertakings. Regarding the land reform movement, the Second Session of the First National Committee discussed and adopted the draft Land Reform Law proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and suggested that the Central People's Government promulgate and implement it. After the Central People's Government promulgated and implemented it, it organized a large number of people to participate in or visit land reform in various places together with relevant agencies. Regarding the suppression of counter-revolutionary movement, the CPPCC participated in the consultation and discussion of the regulations on punishing counter-revolutionaries, and assisted the government in launching all sectors of the people to participate in the struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries through various democratic parties, people's organizations, and provincial and municipal consultation committees. Regarding the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the CPPCC instructed the provincial and municipal consultation committees to vigorously assist these movements through various democratic parties and people's organizations at the beginning of the movements. Subsequently, based on the report of Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, it decided to call on people from all walks of life across the country, especially people in the industrial and commercial sectors, to participate in this struggle. At the same time, it assisted various democratic parties and people's organizations in launching movements from within. Regarding the general task of the country during the transition period, the basic task of the first five-year construction plan, and the issues of socialist transformation and state capitalism, the CPPCC discussed and exchanged views on Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's report, and promoted people from all walks of life to study and publicize the general task of the country during the transition period. Regarding the implementation of the People's Congress system and the formulation of the constitution, the CPPCC exchanged views on the suggestion of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to convene the National People's Congress and local People's Congresses at all levels on a regular basis, and submitted suggestions to the Central People's Government after unanimous agreement. After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the first draft of the constitution, the CPPCC organized people from all walks of life to discuss it together with the Constitution Drafting Committee, and provided many opinions during the discussion. After the draft constitution was announced, it notified the provincial and municipal consultation committees to actively participate in publicity and discussion. In addition, consultations and discussions were also conducted on other important laws and measures, such as the Marriage Law and the Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises, and assisted the government in promoting them. Through the above-mentioned work, on the one hand, the government can concentrate a wide range of opinions when making policy laws, and on the other hand, it can receive multi-faceted assistance and support from all sectors of the people when promoting policy laws. On the other hand, it has improved the awareness of the vast members of the people's democratic united front and promoted the self-education and self-transformation movement in all aspects.

III. Promote and organize the ideological remolding movement of people from all walks of life. This work is carried out from the following two aspects. (1) Promote and organize people from all walks of life to study. Over the past few years, the CPPCC has promoted and organized the study of the Common Program, the main documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the general task of the country during the transition period, and other theories, policies, and current political affairs. Recently, it has also promoted and organized the study of the documents of the First Session of the First National People's Congress. These studies have achieved considerable results. (2) Promote and organize people from all walks of life to participate in actual struggles, such as land reform, resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and other people's political activities and national construction work. Many people have received more profound and practical education and training in participating in actual struggles. The methods of criticism and self-criticism were adopted in the study and participation in actual struggles by people from all walks of life. In order to enable criticism and self-criticism to be carried out correctly, we also advocated the adoption of methods of free debate and appropriate analysis in studying and researching issues, which achieved good results. From their own experiences over the past few years, many people have further understood that criticism and self-criticism are indeed, as Chairman Mao instructed, "the only correct method for all revolutionary people in the people's country to conduct self-education and self-transformation," and have gradually learned to use this valuable weapon of criticism and self-criticism. After several years of ideological remolding, most people have distinguished the enemy from ourselves, improved their ideology of patriotism and internationalism, strengthened their trust in the leadership of the working class, and increased their awareness of accepting socialist transformation and serving the socialist cause, and the number of people who are arming themselves with Marxism-Leninism is also increasing. This has made the people's democratic united front more consolidated and moving towards a higher level.

IV. The working meetings and various groups, under the leadership of the Standing Committee and the Secretary-General, carried out many daily activities, mainly including: (1) Holding forums and report meetings on various policy and current affairs issues. This has played a considerable role in timely understanding and reflecting opinions from all aspects and timely publicizing various policy and current affairs issues. (2) Assisting the government in soliciting opinions and conducting research on relevant policy bills, such as soliciting opinions on the constitution during the constitution drafting process and providing them to relevant parties for reference after research. (3) Assisting various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic人士 in handling certain common activities and issues, such as assisting in the establishment of spare-time political schools for cadres of the headquarters and Beijing branches of various democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, which has been very effective.

V. The work of the provincial and municipal consultation committees, which exercise the functions of the local committees of the CPPCC, has generally progressed in recent years. They have played a role and achieved results to varying degrees in assisting the government, connecting with the people, and promoting people from all walks of life to participate in actual struggles and studies. The CPPCC convened a meeting of secretaries-general of provincial and municipal consultation committees, and adopted several documents on the work and organization of provincial and municipal consultation committees. Later, it sent people to various localities for inspection, convened report meetings of responsible persons of consultation committees in several provinces and cities, and notified consultation committees in several regions to send special reports. Based on the above-mentioned materials, it put forward a summary of the work of provincial and municipal consultation agencies. This has helped the progress of the work of provincial and municipal consultation committees.

In recent years, our work has been successful, but there are also shortcomings. The main shortcomings are: the activities of understanding and reflecting the opinions of the people in various aspects and publicizing various policies and current affairs issues are not frequent and broad enough, assisting various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic人士 in discussing and handling common activities and issues is not proactive enough, and the guidance and assistance to provincial and municipal consultation committees is also insufficient.

The above is a brief report on the several main tasks of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Regarding the preparatory work for the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Standing Committee of the First National Committee, based on the principles of the resolution of the Fourth Session of the First National Committee, based on the current actual situation and actual needs, after careful consultation with relevant parties, unanimously agreed that it is not necessary to hold the Second Plenary Session, but that candidates should be nominated by various democratic parties, people's organizations, and other units, and after consultation and determination by the Standing Committee of the First National Committee, the Second National Committee should be directly formed, and the number of members of the Second National Committee should be appropriately expanded to facilitate the broad unity of representatives from all aspects. It was agreed on the participating units, number of members, and candidates of the Second National Committee. A draft of the Charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was drafted. A separate explanation is given on the draft Charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Fellow members, the First Plenary Session and its National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference have honorably completed their historical tasks. The most fundamental reason why we were able to complete our tasks is due to the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the solid unity and common struggle of all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and all patriotic democratic人士 under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Because of this, we have been able to fulfill our responsibilities in the extremely glorious and great common cause of the people of the whole country.

The preamble to the Constitution points out: "In the future, in the struggle to mobilize and unite the people of the whole country to complete the general task of the country during the transition period and to oppose enemies at home and abroad, the people's democratic united front of our country will continue to play its role." Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his report on the draft Constitution:
"The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is the organizational form of the united front of the people of our country. It once exercised the functions and powers of the National People's Congress. Of course, it will no longer need to exercise these functions and powers in the future, but as an organization of the united front, it will continue to play its role in the political life of our country." It can be seen from this that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as the organization of the people's democratic united front of our country, will continue to shoulder glorious historical tasks.

Based on the general task of our country, the tasks of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in the future will be: on the basis of continuing to strengthen the leadership of the working class and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, through the united efforts of the units participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, to unite all forces that can be united, to strive to build our country into a great socialist country, to struggle to smash all enemies at home and abroad who attempt to undermine our country, and to struggle to defend world peace and develop the cause of human progress.

Based on past experience and new situations, we suggest that in order to complete its tasks in the future, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference needs to continue to strengthen its work in the following aspects:

First, through various democratic parties, people's organizations, people's democratic united front organizations at all levels, and other relevant agencies and personnel, connect with the people in many ways and regularly understand the opinions of the people in various aspects. On this basis, conduct consultations and discussions on important matters related to the country's political life and the people's democratic united front, so as to communicate ideas, unify understanding, reflect the opinions of the people to relevant state agencies, and provide suggestions as needed according to the situation. At the same time, publicize the country's policies and laws, assist in promoting them, and carry out various activities of the people's democratic united front.

Second, through various democratic parties, people's organizations, people's democratic united front organizations at all levels, and other relevant agencies and personnel, promote the ideological remolding of all members of the people's democratic united front combining theory and practice, mobilize and help them strengthen education in patriotism, internationalism, and the general task of the country during the transition period, study Marxist-Leninist theory, actively participate in the cause of socialist construction and socialist transformation, use the method of criticism and self-criticism, and constantly improve their level of awareness.

Third, mobilize the people of the whole country to strive to complete the sacred task of liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, oppose US imperialist aggression, and defend the security of the motherland.

Fourth, promote the activities of the people of the whole country to strengthen the defense of world peace, consolidate and develop friendship with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries and the peace-loving people of the world, and promote international cooperation.

Fifth, regarding the work of local organizations of the people's democratic united front at all levels, it mainly needs to be supported and assisted by the local leadership. At the same time, the National Committee and provincial and municipal organizations of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should give timely instructions to their subordinate organizations, regularly exchange experiences, and conduct necessary inspections to strengthen guidance.

Sixth, assist various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic人士 in discussing and handling common activities and issues and exchanging experiences.

Fellow members, now, our country already has a great constitution developed on the basis of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, thereby making the united struggle of the people of the whole country have a more solid and clear political foundation and goals. The Charter of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which will be discussed and adopted by the First Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, is formulated in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution. We believe that in the future, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will be able to follow the path stipulated by the Constitution, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, under the banner of our country's general task, strengthen unity, continue to move forward, and successfully complete its historical tasks.

    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会副主席　陈叔通主席、各位委员：
    我受中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会常务委员会的委托，提出中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告。
    中国人民政治协商会议于一九四九年九月举行了第一届全体会议，执行了全国人民代表大会的职权，制定了中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领，选举了中央人民政府委员会，宣告了中华人民共和国的成立；同时，选举了中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会。几年来，我们国家胜利地进行了改革土地制度、抗美援朝、镇压反革命分子、恢复国民经济、“三反”“五反”和思想改造等伟大的斗争，全国人民的觉悟程度和组织程度大大提高，以中国共产党为领导的人民民主统一战线愈益巩固。在这一系列的伟大胜利的基础上，实行了普选的人民代表大会制度，以代替过去由中国人民政治协商会议全体会议执行全国人民代表大会职权及由地方各界人民代表会议代行地方人民代表大会职权的过渡形式。具有伟大历史意义的第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，制定了伟大的划时代的宪法，成为“标志着我国人民从一九四九年建国以来的新胜利和新发展的里程碑”。在此期间，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，曾在上述各方面的人民事业中进行了工作，发挥了重要的作用，现在简要报告如下。
    一、动员和团结全国人民反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国安全，保卫世界和平。当美帝国主义在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，打到我国边境，并侵占了我国领土台湾的时候，本会根据广大人民的要求，与各民主党派协商，于一九五○年十一月四日发布了“各民主党派联合宣言”，发起了伟大的抗美援朝运动。此后，本会复多次与各民主党派、各人民团体联合发出号召，如纪念抗日战争胜利日六周年的宣言、对于美帝国主义进行细菌战的抗议、反对联合国大会关于朝鲜问题非法决议的声明等，以推动抗美援朝运动的开展；同时，经过各民主党派、各人民团体及各省、市协商委员会，动员各方面参加抗美援朝的各种活动，并会同中国人民抗美援朝总会组织了三次赴朝慰问的工作。在第一届全国委员会第三次和第四次会议上，曾先后通过决议，号召全国人民继续加强抗美援朝斗争。全国人民以各种实际行动响应了上述各项号召，热烈地参加了抗美援朝的斗争。抗美援朝运动的广泛深入的开展，激发了全国人民的爱国主义与国际主义的精神，粉碎了遗留在一部分人们中的亲美、崇美、恐美的思想，加强了全国人民的团结，大大地巩固和发展了人民民主统一战线。当朝鲜停战和印度支那恢复和平已经胜利实现，美帝国主义不甘失败，继续侵占我国领土台湾，并与蒋介石卖国集团加紧勾结，企图扩大对我国的武装干涉和战争威胁，继续制造国际紧张局势的时候，本会针对此种形势，与各民主党派、各人民团体协商，于一九五四年八月二十二日发布了为解放台湾联合宣言，表达了全国人民一定要解放台湾的坚定不移的意志。为了维护世界和平和促进国际合作，本会曾先后通过了号召全国人民展开保卫世界和平签名运动的办法、支持五大国缔结和平公约的要求的决议和支持世界人民和平大会各项要求的决议。这些号召也都得到全国人民的热烈响应，仅在缔结和平公约宣言上签名者即达三亿四千四百万人以上。为了发展和巩固世界和平的强大基础——中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，本会曾在十月社会主义革命三十五周年的时候，经过各民主党派、各人民团体及各省、市协商委员会，动员和组织了各界人士参加中苏友好协会发动的“中苏友好月”的各项工作，并进行学习苏联的活动。为了表示对保卫祖国安全和世界和平的人民解放军的深切关怀，本会曾会同中国人民抗美援朝总会组织了慰问人民解放军的工作。
    二、协助政府动员人民进行各种革命运动及建设事业。关于土地改革运动，第一届全国委员会第二次会议曾对中国共产党中央提出的土地改革法草案讨论通过，建议中央人民政府颁布施行；在中央人民政府颁布施行后，曾会同有关机关组织了大批人士到各地参加或参观土地改革。关于镇压反革命运动，本会曾参加了惩治反革命条例的协商、讨论，并经过各民主党派、各人民团体和各省、市协商委员会，协助政府发动各阶层人民参加镇压反革命的斗争。关于“三反”“五反”运动，本会在运动开展起来之初，即指示各省、市协商委员会通过各民主党派、各人民团体大力协助这一运动；随后又依据周恩来副主席的报告，决定号召全国社会人士特别是工商界人士参加这一斗争；同时，协助各民主党派和人民团体从其内部展开运动。关于国家在过渡时期的总任务、第一个五年建设计划的基本任务及社会主义改造和国家资本主义的问题，本会曾就周恩来副主席的报告进行了讨论，交换了意见，并推动了各界人士学习和宣传国家过渡时期总任务。关于实行人民代表大会制度和制定宪法，本会曾就中国共产党提出的定期召开全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会的建议交换了意见，经一致同意后向中央人民政府提出了建议；当中国共产党中央提出了宪法草案的初稿后，本会曾会同宪法起草委员会组织了各方面人士进行讨论，在讨论中曾提供了不少的意见；宪法草案公布后，又曾通知各省、市协商委员会积极参加宣传和讨论。此外，对其他一些重要法令和措施，如婚姻法、公私合营工业企业暂行条例等，也都进行了协商、讨论，并协助政府推行。经过上述这些工作，一方面，使政府既能在决定政策法令时集中广泛的意见，又能在推行政策法令时得到多方面的协助和各界人民的支持；另一方面，提高了人民民主统一战线广大成员的觉悟水平，推动了各方面的自我教育和自我改造运动。
    三、推动和组织各界人士的思想改造运动。关于这一工作，是从以下两方面进行的。（1）推动和组织各界人士进行学习。几年来本会曾推动和组织了对共同纲领、苏共第十九次代表大会的主要文件、国家过渡时期总任务及其他的理论、政策和时事政治的学习。最近又推动和组织了对第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议文件的学习。这些学习都获得了相当的效果。（2）推动和组织各界人士参加实际斗争，如土地改革、抗美援朝、镇压反革命、“三反”“五反”等运动及其他人民政治活动和国家建设工作。许多人都在参加实际斗争中受到比较深刻、切实的教育和锻炼。在各界人士进行学习和参加实际斗争中，采用了批评和自我批评的方法。为使批评和自我批评能够正确进行，我们并曾提倡在学习和研究问题中采取自由辩论、适当分析的方法，收到良好的效果。许多人们从几年来的亲身体验中更加领会了批评和自我批评确如毛主席所指示的是“人民国家内全体革命人民进行自我教育和自我改造的惟一正确的方法”，并逐渐学会使用批评和自我批评这个宝贵的武器。各界人士经过几年来的思想改造运动，大多数人分清了敌我界限，提高了爱国主义和国际主义的思想，加强了对工人阶级领导的信任，增进了接受社会主义改造和为社会主义事业服务的觉悟，其中正在以马克思列宁主义武装自己的人也日益增多。这就使得人民民主统一战线更加巩固，并且向着更高的水平前进。
    四、工作会议和各组在常务委员会和秘书长领导下进行了许多日常活动，主要有：（1）举行属于各种政策时事问题的座谈会、报告会。这对于及时地了解、反映各方面的意见和及时地宣传各种政策时事问题，都起了相当的作用。（2）协助政府对有关的政策法案征集意见和进行研究，如在宪法起草过程中曾征集有关宪法的意见，经研究后提供有关方面参考。（3）协助各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士处理某些共同性的活动和问题，如协助举办各民主党派总部及北京市分部和全国工商联的机关干部业余政治学校，收效良好。
    五、代行本会地方委员会职权的各省、市协商委员会几年来的工作一般都有进展，在协助政府、联系人民、推动各界人士参加实际斗争和学习等工作上，都在不同程度上起了作用，获得成绩。本会曾召开了全国省、市协商委员会秘书长会议，并通过了几个关于省、市协商委员会的工作和组织的文件，以后又曾派人赴地方视察，召集几个省、市的协商委员会的负责人举行汇报会议和通知若干地区的协商委员会送来专题报告，并根据上述材料提出了关于省、市协商机关工作的总结。这对省、市协商委员会工作的进展均有帮助。
    几年来，我们的工作是有成绩的，但还有缺点。主要缺点是：了解、反映各方面人民意见和宣传各种政策时事问题的活动不够经常和宽广，协助各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士商讨处理共同性的活动和问题不够主动，对省、市协商委员会的指导和帮助也是不够的。
    以上是中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会的几项主要工作的简要报告。
    关于中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会的筹备工作，第一届全国委员会常务委员会依据第一届全国委员会第四次会议决议的原则，依据当前的实际情况和实际需要，经过和有关方面慎重协商，一致议定了不必举行第二届全体会议，而由各民主党派、各人民团体及其他单位提出人选，经第一届全国委员会常务委员会协商确定，直接组成第二届全国委员会，并适当扩大第二届全国委员会的名额，以利于广泛团结各方面的代表人物；商定了第二届全国委员会的参加单位、名额及人选；草拟了中国人民政治协商会议章程。关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案另有说明。
    各位委员，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议及其全国委员会已经光荣地完成了自己的历史任务。我们之所以能够完成自己的任务，最根本的原因就是由于中国共产党的领导以及各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和一切爱国民主人士在中国共产党领导下的坚固团结和共同奋斗。由于这样，我们才能够在全国人民的极其光荣伟大的共同事业中尽到自己的责任。
    宪法序言中指出：“今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线将继续发挥它的作用。”刘少奇委员长在关于宪法草案的报告中指出：
  “中国人民政治协商会议是我国人民民主统一战线的组织形式。它曾代行全国人民代表大会的职权，这种职权今后当然不再需要由它行使，但是它作为统一战线的组织将在我国的政治生活中继续发挥它的作用。”由此可见，作为我国人民民主统一战线组织的中国人民政治协商会议将继续担负着光荣的历史任务。
    依据我们国家的总任务，今后中国人民政治协商会议的任务将是：在继续加强工人阶级领导和巩固工农联盟的基础上，经过参加中国人民政治协商会议的各单位在中国共产党领导下的团结努力，去团结一切可以团结的力量，为建设我国成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而斗争，为粉碎一切企图破坏我们国家的内外敌人而斗争，为保卫世界和平和发展人类进步事业而斗争。
    依据以往经验和新的情况，我们建议，今后中国人民政治协商会议为了完成自己的任务，需要从以下几个方面继续加强自己的工作：
    第一，经过各民主党派、各人民团体、各级人民民主统一战线组织及其他有关机关和人员，多方面地联系人民，经常地了解各方面人民的意见。在此基础上，就有关国家政治生活和人民民主统一战线的重要事项进行协商讨论，以沟通思想，统一认识，并向有关国家机关反映人民的意见和依情况需要提供建议；同时，对国家的政策、法令进行宣传，协助推行，并进行人民民主统一战线的各种活动。
    第二，经过各民主党派、各人民团体、各级人民民主统一战线组织及其他有关机关和人员，推动人民民主统一战线全体成员进行理论和实践相结合的思想改造，动员和帮助他们加强爱国主义、国际主义和国家过渡时期总任务的教育，学习马克思列宁主义理论，积极参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业，运用批评和自我批评的方法，不断地提高觉悟水平。
    第三，动员全国人民努力完成解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的神圣任务，反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国安全。
    第四，推动全国人民加强保卫世界和平、巩固和发展对苏联和各人民民主国家及全世界爱好和平的人民的友谊、促进国际合作的活动。
    第五，关于各级人民民主统一战线地方组织的工作，主要需由当地领导方面加以支持和帮助；同时，中国人民政治协商会议的全国委员会及省、市组织，对其下级组织应及时给予指示，经常交流经验，进行必要检查，以加强指导。
    第六，协助各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士商讨处理共同性的活动和问题并交流经验。
    各位委员，现在，我们国家已经有了一个在中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的基础上发展起来的伟大的宪法，从而使全国人民的团结奋斗有了更为坚固明确的政治基础和前进目标。中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议即将讨论和通过的中国人民政治协商会议章程，就是根据宪法的精神制定的。我们相信，今后中国人民政治协商会议必能按照宪法所规定的道路，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，在我们国家总任务的旗帜下，加强团结，继续前进，圆满地完成自己的历史任务。
