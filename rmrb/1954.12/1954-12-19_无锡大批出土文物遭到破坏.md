To the Editor:

    In the Huishan and Meiyuan areas of Wuxi City, there are more than a dozen basic construction projects underway simultaneously. On these construction sites, many ancient tombs dating from the Han Dynasty to the Six Dynasties have been discovered successively, and a large number of precious ancient cultural relics have been unearthed. Unfortunately, these cultural relics have been severely damaged. For example, at the construction site of the No. 1 Middle School affiliated to the Wuxi Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education, many ancient cultural relics dating from the Han to the Six Dynasties were damaged during the construction of the classroom building foundation and transportation roads. On the west slope of Changyao Mound alone, two geometric patterned brick tombs from the Six Dynasties and one large brick tomb from the Ming Dynasty with inscriptions were destroyed. According to construction workers, the Nigu Mound had the most bottles and jars underground, but because no one cared about them, they were all destroyed. On this construction site, many exquisite patterned bricks were used to pave lime pits, and large inscribed Ming Dynasty bricks were used to pave the inside and outside of the kitchen. Only two Six Dynasties bottles were placed in the office as vases, and there were plans to use a small and exquisite Song Dynasty porcelain flower box as an ashtray.

    In other places, such as the construction site of the Fifth Engineering Office, eight pottery pieces were unearthed continuously, six of which were broken, and the other two were taken away by local farmers. According to Director Jiang of the Sixth Engineering Office himself, "Because we didn't pay attention to the protection of ancient cultural relics in the past, all the unearthed cultural relics were destroyed." At the Helukou construction site, when dealing with ownerless tombs and building foundations, many large tombs and ancient cultural relics were excavated. Except for gold and silver jewelry, jade bracelets, and court beads that were preserved and handed over, other items such as pottery pots, mud jars, porcelain bowls, bronze mirrors, and swords were all destroyed.

    In the eastern suburbs of Wuxi City, there is a large earth mound that is one and a half li long. There are many ancient tombs here. When earth was taken to fill the river in May of this year, most of these ancient tombs were destroyed. According to the fragments found, most of them were Ming Dynasty artifacts.

    The large-scale destruction of unearthed cultural relics on basic construction sites in Wuxi City is the direct responsibility of the Municipal Government Bureau of Culture and Education, the Construction Engineering Bureau, and the Construction Bureau. They have neither seriously studied nor earnestly implemented the instructions on the protection of ancient cultural relics repeatedly issued by higher authorities, and they have taken an irresponsible attitude of letting things take their course after the problems occurred. This is very wrong.

### 无锡大批出土文物遭到破坏

    无锡大批出土文物遭到破坏编辑同志：
    在无锡市的惠山、梅园一带，有十几处基本建设工程在同时施工。就在这些工地上，先后发现好多汉朝到六朝以来的古墓，出土了大批珍贵的古文物，但是不幸，这些文物遭到了严重的破坏。如无锡市人民政府文教局直属第一中学工地，在建筑教室楼房基地和交通道时，就破坏了很多汉至六朝以来的古文物。单在长腰墩西墩崖被打毁的就有六朝几何印纹砖墓两座，有文字可考的明代大砖墓一座。据建筑工人们说，尼姑墩地下的瓶、罐最多，因为没有人过问，全被破坏了，在这个工地上有好多精美的印纹砖被弄去铺石灰坑，有字的明代大砖被铺在厨房内外，仅有二只六朝瓶被放在办公室内当花瓶用，还打算把一只小巧精致的宋代花瓷盒当作烟灰缸用。
    其它如第五工程处所在工地，连续出土八只陶器，其中有六只被打坏，还有两只被当地农民拿走了。据第六工程处蒋主任自己说：“由于过去没有重视对古文物的保护，所有出土文物都打掉了。”河埒口工地在处理无主墓和打墙基时，曾挖掘了不少大坟墓和古文物，除金银首饰、玉镯朝珠等保存上缴外，其他如瓦壶、泥罐、瓷碗、铜镜、宝剑等等都被破坏了。
    在无锡市东郊有一长达一里半的大土墩，这里有很多古墓，今年五月动工取土填河时，这些古墓绝大部分都被破坏了。根据所拾得的残片考证，大都为明代器物。
    无锡市基本建设工地大批出土文物遭到破坏，市政府文教局、建设工程局、建设局等单位应负有直接的责任，他们对上级多次发布的有关保护古文物的指示，既没认真研究，更不认真执行，而且当问题发生后，仍采取了听之任之的不负责态度，这是很不应该的。　朱　江、石祚华、张寄庵
