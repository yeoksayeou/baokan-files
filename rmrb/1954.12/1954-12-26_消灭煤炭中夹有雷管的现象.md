Eliminating the Phenomenon of Detonators Mixed in Coal
To the Editor:
    Coal building materials companies in various regions have repeatedly discovered unexploded detonators in coal transported from certain coal mines. For example, from May to July this year, the Xingtai Coal Building Branch in Hebei Province discovered and picked out a total of five unexploded detonators in coal from Yuci on four separate occasions. On October 15th, the Tianjin East Station Coal Building Operation Office also picked out an unexploded detonator when unloading eight trucks of Datong raw coal sent from Kouquan. After discovering the above situation, the China Coal Building Company notified the Coal Mine Management Bureau and the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry (Yuci Mine is under the leadership of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry) respectively to inform their subordinate mines to pay attention to checking this issue. However, up to now, this situation is still being discovered. For example, the Northeast Yingkou Coal Building Company's coal storage yard discovered twelve unexploded detonators with wires in lump coal transported from Fushun on November 12th at one time, and immediately picked them up and handed them over to the local public security department.
    The presence of unexploded detonators in coal has a serious impact on the safety of coal users. If the unexploded detonators in the coal are not picked out in advance, the detonators may explode when the user burns the coal, which may cause casualties and cause huge losses to national construction. The fuel industry management departments and the leaders of relevant mines should attach great importance to this issue, strictly check production management, and conscientiously implement safety operating procedures, and must pick out the detonators in the coal. Coal building companies in various regions should also educate employees to pay attention to inspection during the process of coal shipment, inspection, receipt, loading, unloading, stacking and sales. If detonators are found, they should be picked out and handed over to the relevant leading authorities for appropriate handling, and contact the relevant mines in a timely manner.

### 消灭煤炭中夹有雷管的现象

    消灭煤炭中夹有雷管的现象编辑同志：
    各地煤业建筑器材公司在某些煤矿运来的煤炭中，曾多次发现有没有爆炸过的雷管。如今年五月到七月间，河北省邢台煤建支公司在榆次来煤中曾先后四次发现和拣出未爆炸的雷管共五个。天津市东站煤建经营处在十月十五日收到由口泉发来的大同原煤八车，卸车归堆时也拣出了未爆炸的雷管一个。中国煤建公司发现以上情况后，分别通知煤矿管理总局和山西省工业厅（榆次矿属山西省工业厅领导）转告所属各矿注意检查这一问题。但是，到现在为止，这种情况仍有发现，如东北营口市煤建公司储煤场十一月十二日在抚顺运来的块煤内
  一次就发现尚未爆炸并带有电线的雷管十二个，当即拣起送交当地公安部门。
    煤内含有未爆炸的雷管，对用煤户的安全有着严重的影响。如果煤炭里所带未爆炸的雷管事先没有拣出，用户烧煤时雷管爆炸，就可能造成伤亡事故，并给国家建设造成巨大的损失。燃料工业管理部门和有关各矿领导方面应该高度重视这个问题，严格检查生产管理情况，切实执行安全操作规程，必须把煤炭中的雷管拣净。各地煤建公司也应该教育职工在煤炭发运、检收、装卸、上垛和销售过程中经常注意检查，如果发现雷管就应该拣出交给有关领导机关作适当处理，并及时向有关矿方联系。
