    In Memory of Comrade Yang Lisan
    Nie Rongzhen
    The sad news arrived that one of our old comrades-in-arms—Comrade Yang Lisan, Minister of the Finance Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and one of the outstanding leaders of rear service work—died of malignant brain cancer at the Kremlin Hospital in Moscow on November 28, 1954, despite prolonged treatment. The death of Comrade Yang Lisan is a major loss to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We, who have worked with Comrade Lisan for a long time, feel particularly grieved.
    Comrade Yang Lisan was an old party member and old cadre with a long revolutionary history and rich working experience in our party and our army. Starting from 1925, Comrade Lisan began his revolutionary activities, initially engaging in the peasant movement. He joined the Communist Party of China in January 1927, and the Party then sent him to participate in the guard regiment of the then Wuhan government. When Chiang Kai-shek openly betrayed the revolution on April 12, 1927, followed by the successive betrayals of the Wuhan government in July of the same year, the counter-revolutionary forces frantically slaughtered communists and revolutionary masses everywhere, creating white terror and suppressing the revolutionary movement; Comrade Yang Lisan, like many of our old comrades at the time, was not intimidated by the counter-revolutionary terror. Instead, he resolutely responded to the Party's call, followed the guard regiment to Nanchang, and participated in the Nanchang Uprising. Because the guard regiment troops failed to catch up with the main force of the Nanchang Uprising, they moved to the border area of Hunan and Jiangxi, and heroically participated in the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Comrade Mao Zedong, joining the remaining troops of the Autumn Harvest Uprising to go to Jinggangshan. From then on, Comrade Yang Lisan participated in the land revolutionary war, the 25,000-li Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Liberation War, working hard for twenty-seven years until his last breath. The life of Comrade Yang Lisan was linked to the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Armed Forces created and led by the Chinese Communist Party. It was a life full of hardships, bloodshed, sacrifice, and imbued with infinite revolutionary enthusiasm and tenacious perseverance; it was a glorious life.
    Comrade Yang Lisan was also a cadre in our party and our army who dedicated himself to a specific task for a long time, working diligently and selflessly, and remaining honest and incorruptible until his death. Since joining the Red Army, Comrade Lisan had devoted almost all of his time to rear service work for the army. Before we gained national power, the onerousness of the task and the difficulties of the objective conditions were difficult for those who did not participate in the struggle at that time to imagine. In the backward conditions of the countryside, in unstable combat situations without rear areas, the army relied entirely on its own efforts to raise grain and funds, establish small clothing factories, pharmaceutical factories, and ordnance factories, and organize long-distance front-line transportation and rear-line delivery by manual labor and animal power, doing both local residents' work and directly supporting the war effort. This was an extremely onerous and difficult task. However, Comrade Lisan never bowed to difficulties, nor did he complain to the Party. He persisted in this work tenaciously and unyieldingly for a long time, working diligently, developing a creative spirit, overcoming all difficulties, and completing the task of supporting the war. After the victory of the national revolutionary war, the establishment of the Central People's Government, and the shift of our army's construction towards modernization and regularization, the work of rear service to guarantee the victory of modern warfare did not in the slightest reduce its responsibility. On the contrary, due to the development of modern military science and technology, the complexity and arduousness of rear service work increased. Comrade Lisan, in line with his consistent spirit of serving the people, continued to stick to his post in rear service work and engaged in the modernization of our army's rear service work. All of Comrade Yang Lisan's revolutionary activities were based on the interests of the people and the interests of the Party as the highest interests. This was a manifestation of his infinite loyalty to the cause of the people and the Party, and it was a noble quality of a communist.
    Unfortunately, just when our party and our army needed Comrade Lisan to continue to give play to his revolutionary spirit and use his rich experience to engage in even greater undertakings, Comrade Lisan was unfortunately stricken with an incurable disease and passed away, leaving us forever. What a huge loss this is!
    Comrade Yang Lisan has left us forever, but his revolutionary spirit, his glorious history, his noble qualities, and his contributions to our army's rear service work will forever live in the hearts of our comrades. Comrade Lisan's life has set a very good example for all our revolutionary comrades, especially for the comrades in our army's rear service work and financial work. We should learn from him.
    Comrade Lisan, rest in peace!

    悼念杨立三同志
    聂荣臻
    噩耗传来，我们一位老战友——中国人民解放军财务部部长、优秀的后方勤务工作领导人之一——杨立三同志，因患脑恶性癌疾，久治无效，竟于一九五四年十一月二十八日病逝于莫斯科克里姆林宫医院。杨立三同志的逝世，是中国人民解放军的一个重大损失。对于我们曾经长期同立三同志一道工作过的同志特别感到哀痛。
    杨立三同志是我党我军中具有长期革命历史和丰富工作经验的一个老党员、老干部。从一九二五年起，立三同志就开始了他的革命活动，起初是做农民运动，一九二七年一月加入中国共产党，而后党派遣他参加了当时武汉政府的警卫团。当一九二七年四月十二日蒋介石公开背叛革命，接着在同年的七月武汉政府相继叛变之后，反革命势力曾疯狂地到处屠杀共产党人和革命群众，制造白色恐怖，镇压革命运动；杨立三同志在当时和我们许多老同志一样，并没有被反革命的恐怖所吓倒，而且坚决地响应党的号召，随警卫团赶往南昌，参加南昌起义。警卫团部队因未能赶上南昌起义的大军，便转到湘赣边界活动，由是又英勇地参加了毛泽东同志所领导的秋收起义，同秋收起义的其余部队一起上了井冈山。从那时起，杨立三同志便一直参加土地革命战争，二万五千里长征，抗日战争，解放战争，二十七年如一日地艰苦工作到最后的一息。杨立三同志的一生是和中国人民、中国共产党所创造和领导的中国人民武装力量的反帝反封建斗争联系在一起的，这是充满了艰难困苦、流血牺牲、具有无限的革命热情和坚韧的毅力的一生，这是光荣的一生。
    杨立三同志又是我党我军中长期地专心致力于一项专门业务，任劳任怨，廉洁奉公，一直到死而后已的具有优良革命品质的干部。立三同志从参加红军开始，几乎全部的时间都是担负军队的后方勤务工作，这个工作在我们还没有取得全国政权之前，其任务的繁重，客观条件的困难，是一般没有参加过当时斗争的人所难以想像的。在农村的落后条件下，在不稳定的、没有后方的战斗情况中，全靠军队自行筹粮、筹款，自己建立小型的被服厂、制药厂、兵工厂，依靠人力和畜力组织长途的前运后送，一手做地方居民工作，一手做直接支援战争的工作，这是一件十分繁重而困难的任务。但立三同志从没有向困难低头，也从没有向党叫苦，坚持地、不屈不挠地长期担任这种工作，埋头苦干，发扬创造精神，克服了一切困难，完成了支援战争的任务。在全国革命战争胜利、中央人民政府成立、我军的建设转向现代化、正规化的目标前进的时候，为保障现代战争胜利的后方勤务工作，并没有丝毫减轻它的责任，相反的、由于现代军事科学和技术的发展，更增加了后方勤务工作的复杂性和艰苦性。立三同志本着一贯的为人民服务的精神，继续坚守后方勤务工作的岗位，从事我军后方勤务工作现代化的建设事业，杨立三同志的全部革命活动，是以人民的利益、党的利益为最高利益的，这是对人民、对党的事业无限忠诚的表现，这是共产党员高尚的品质。
    不幸，正当我党我军需要立三同志继续发挥其革命精神，运用其丰富经验，以从事更伟大的事业的时候，而立三同志身患不治之症，竟离开我们而长逝了，这是多么巨大的一件损失呵！
    杨立三同志和我们永别了，但是他的革命精神，他的光荣历史，他的崇高品质，他对于我军后方勤务工作的贡献，是永远活在我们同志的心坎中的。立三同志的一生，为我们所有革命同志、特别是我军后方勤务工作和财务工作的同志树立了一个很好的榜样，我们应该向他学习。
    立三同志，你安息吧！
