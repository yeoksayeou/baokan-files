Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 23rd: According to TASS, the Allied Council for Austria held a special meeting on December 21st at the request of the Soviet representative. At the meeting, the Soviet High Commissioner for Austria, Ilyichev, issued a statement regarding the actions of the U.S. occupation authorities in Austria which violated the four-power agreement (Soviet Union, Great Britain, United States, France) concerning Austria.

In his statement, Ilyichev pointed out that U.S. troops, under the pretext of protecting the transportation lines through western Austria connecting U.S. military bases in Italy and West Germany, have illegally stationed themselves in the French occupation zone, especially in the province of Tyrol, and have built military repair shops and warehouses for fuel, equipment, weapons, and ammunition there. These warehouses are guarded by U.S. armed forces. Several towns in the French zone are patrolled by U.S. military police.

Ilyichev pointed out that the actions of the U.S. occupation authorities are an inadmissible attempt to illegally expand the U.S. occupation zone in Austria and to use the territory of western Austria to achieve the goals of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc. Such unilateral measures to promote the merging of the various occupation zones will ultimately harm the integrity of the Austrian state.

Ilyichev urged the Allied Council for Austria to take note of these facts, declared that the stationing of U.S. armed forces within the French zone of Austria violated the four-power agreement (Soviet Union, Great Britain, United States, France) concerning Austria, and instructed the U.S. side to withdraw these armed forces and dismantle the U.S. military installations and equipment within the French zone.

The French High Commissioner for Austria, Chauvel, and the U.S. High Commissioner for Austria, Thompson, both acknowledged the stationing of U.S. occupation troops within the French zone of Austria, but attempted to find excuses to justify this illegal action by the United States. The British High Commissioner for Austria, Wallinger, also attempted to defend the U.S. occupation authorities.

Because the representatives of the Western countries refused to adopt the aforementioned Soviet proposal, no agreement was reached on this issue.

    苏联代表谴责美军进驻法占区的非法行动
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：盟国对奥管制委员会十二月二十一日应苏联代表的要求举行特别会议。苏联驻奥地利高级专员伊利切夫在会上就美国驻奥地利占领当局违反苏、英、美、法四国关于奥地利的协定的行动发表声明。
    伊利切夫在声明中指出，美国军队借口保卫穿过奥地利西部连接美国在意大利的军事基地和西德的交通线，已经非法地驻扎在法国占领区，特别是蒂罗尔省境内，并且在那里建筑了军用修配厂和燃料、装备、武器、弹药的仓库。这些仓库都由美国武装部队警卫。法占区的若干市镇都是美国宪兵巡逻。
    伊利切夫指出：美国占领当局的这种行动是一种非法扩大美国在奥地利的占领区和利用奥地利西部领土来实现侵略性的北大西洋集团的目的的企图，这是不能容许的。这种促使各个占领区合并的片面措施最后会损害奥地利国家的完整。
    伊利切夫促使盟国对奥管制委员会注意这些事实，宣布美国武装部队驻扎在奥地利的法占区境内违反了苏、英、美、法四国有关奥地利的协定，并且责成美国方面撤出这些武装部队，撤除在法占区境内的美国军事机构和设备。
    法国驻奥高级专员萧维尔和美国驻奥高级专员汤普逊都承认了美国占领军部队驻扎在奥地利法占区内，但是企图寻找借口来为美国这一非法行动辩解。英国驻奥高级专员华林格尔也企图为美国占领当局辩解。
    由于西方国家的代表们拒绝通过苏联的上述建议，在这个问题上没有达成一致决定。
