    Second All-Union Congress of Writers
    Telegram of Respect to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
    The Second All-Union Congress of Writers extends its warmest respects to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
    We, the representatives of the multi-ethnic literature of our great motherland, express our gratitude to our own Communist Party for the wise care it has given to the continuous progress of our literature towards new achievements and victories.
    Inspired and led by the Communist Party, the Soviet people are tirelessly developing heavy industry—the foundation of the socialist economy—and are making every effort to strengthen the power of the Soviet state; the inexhaustible energy of the atomic nucleus has begun to serve mankind for the first time in history in our country; in a short period of time, one hydroelectric station after another is being built on the largest rivers such as the Volga, Ob, and Angara; in one agricultural season, more than 17 million hectares of virgin and fallow land have been reclaimed. All this is happening in a country where everyone is learning, and the number of students in higher education has reached two million.
    The entire material and spiritual strength of the people of all brotherly nationalities of the Soviet Union has developed and surged vigorously. The platform of our congress is a platform of fraternal friendship for writers who are engaged in their creative work in different languages, but who are united under a common goal, which is to strive for the construction of communism and to fight for peace and friendship between countries.
    Gorky's words have come true, he said, "At the Second All-Union Congress of Writers, there will be dozens of writers from the West and the East, and writers from China and India will be present."
    Progressive writers from all over the world, our friends and guests from various people's democratic countries and capitalist countries, have brought us their friendship and words of congratulation. They have joined us in voicing their calls to fight for life and against death, against the conspiracies of the evil forces that are preparing to drag the people of all countries into war.
    The decaying capitalist world is attempting to plunge mankind into a state of spiritual poverty and moral degradation. The literature of imperialism attempts to despise people, arouse base instincts, and obliterate Gorky's inspiring slogan, "Man—how proud that word sounds!"
    From the time our literature was born, our literary works have been filled with unwavering confidence in mankind and in mankind's bright future. The image of its protagonist—the warrior who fights for the happiness of all mankind—has deeply penetrated the hearts of ordinary people in all countries. The strength of our literature lies in its inseparable connection with all of life, with all the thoughts, feelings, and great deeds of the people, and with the heroic struggle of the Communist Party. Soviet literature and the goals of the great October Socialist Revolution are inseparable. The history of our multi-ethnic literature is a picture of the development of the socialist system, a picture of the arduous struggle of the people, and a picture of the great victories won in fierce struggles.
    Soviet writers strive to express the truth of reality in its revolutionary development through their novels and short stories, poems and dramas, rhymes and songs.
    In the new constitution of the Soviet Writers' Association adopted at our Second All-Union Congress of Writers, we talked about the lofty mission of socialist literature:
    In the transition from socialism to communism, the role of Soviet literature in social change and active education must be greatly strengthened.
    Soviet literature must display the magnificence and greatness of communist ideas in a high degree of artistic form, effectively fight against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds, reflect the diversity of their labor, social, and private lives in the image of its protagonists, and boldly expose the contradictions and conflicts in life. Soviet literature must not only reflect new things but also strive to help them win victory.
    Soviet literature must cultivate the patriotic feelings of the Soviet people with full revolutionary enthusiasm, strengthen international friendship, help consolidate the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and uphold the ideas of proletarian internationalism and the fraternal unity of working people.
    These words in our new constitution not only express our wishes, but also illustrate the achievements already made by Soviet socialist literature. It is because of these characteristics that our literature is loved by its broad readership—the builders of communism. It is these characteristics that have made many of our literary works lifelong friends and companions of Soviet men and women—whether in peacetime or in wartime.
    We, the delegates attending the Second All-Union Congress of Writers, clearly realize that although our literature has achieved success, it is far from enough to fulfill its lofty mission. The rapidly developing reality of socialist countries needs to be embodied in immortal works, in images of great artistic power. We must be familiar with and love the history of our heroic Party, the history of our new society.
    We must be good at deeply portraying the struggle between the new and the old, the decaying, affirming the magnificence and greatness of the communist cause, and boldly exposing the contradictions and conflicts in life. Only persistent and selfless work—the work of a true artist of language is such work, coupled with a high degree of cultural and artistic cultivation, can bring us closer to meeting the spiritual requirements and needs of our broad readership.
    Socialist realism is a new stage in the history of human art development. Today, in all the countries where the works of Soviet writers can reach, workers understand this. The influence of the ideas and images of our literature is growing year by year around the world.
    Our Second All-Union Congress of Writers was conducted under the slogan of the strictest criticism and self-criticism. Writers of different generations and nationalities unanimously advocated high ideological and artistic requirements. However, we have not done for the people what we can do and should do. We must write in such a way that young people and children regard the protagonists in our literature as their comrades and models! We must write in such a way that our working readers follow the protagonists we write about into creative labor, into the struggle to win a glorious new world with reasonable and the best human relations! We must write in such a way that the unfortunate people in the most remote lands of the world hear our voices as friends and brothers who support them in their arduous struggles; let our voices resound like a hymn of freedom!
    The method of socialist realism is a prerequisite for writers to fully develop their individuality, adopt diverse styles, and various creative trends. We must persistently seek new artistic methods to best express the great truth of our ideas and the richness and diversity of our lives.
    The Second All-Union Congress of Writers criticized the weaknesses and shortcomings in our literature, called on all Soviet writers to further develop the best traditions of Russian classical literature, the literature of the fraternal countries within the Soviet Union, and world literature, boldly affirm the traditions formed by our Soviet socialist literature, and creatively study the valuable experiences of the artistic techniques of our foreign friends.
    Soviet writers have the responsibility to unswervingly improve all work in promoting and training new people in literature, and to abide by Gorky's teachings and traditions on this extremely important issue.
    The Second All-Union Congress of Writers assures the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that the vast army of Soviet intellectuals and literary workers, united around the Communist Party, is prepared to redouble its efforts to realize the demands of the people.
    The Second All-Union Congress of Writers is an important historical milestone in the development of our country's literature. The writers are fully determined to greatly improve the activities of their association, strengthen self-criticism in their ranks, eliminate all forms of pride and complacency, and make strict demands on skills. The writers are determined to wage a continuous struggle against all deviations from socialist realism, against manifestations of alien bourgeois nationalism and cosmopolitanism, and against the influence of bourgeois naturalism and formalism.
    Soviet writers live and work with their own people and Party in the same thoughts and feelings.
    We defend the cause of world peace, and we will use all our strength to promote its victory. Today, the sky is once again filled with dark clouds. But, if someone commits a crime and launches another war, Soviet writers will selflessly dedicate their talents, their art, and their lives to their socialist motherland, just as they did in the last anti-German fascist war that ended in the destruction of Hitler's dictatorship.
    Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its Central Committee!
    Long live communism!

### 第二次全苏作家代表大会  向苏联共产党中央委员会致敬电

    第二次全苏作家代表大会
    向苏联共产党中央委员会致敬电
    第二次全苏作家代表大会向苏联共产党中央委员会致热烈的敬意。
    我们、我们伟大祖国的多民族文学的代表，对我们自己的共产党表示感谢，感谢它对我们的文学朝着新的成就和胜利不断前进所给予的英明的关怀。
    苏联人民在共产党的鼓舞和领导下，正在不倦地发展重工业——社会主义经济的基础——并且在尽力加强苏维埃国家的力量；用之不竭的原子核能在历史上第一次在我们的国家内开始为人类服务；在短短的时间内，一个接着一个的水电站正在伏尔加河、鄂毕河和安加拉河几条最大的河流上兴建起来；在一个农业季节，开垦了一千七百多万公顷生荒地和熟荒地。这一切都发生在这样一个国家，在这个国家里，每个人都在学习，高等学校学生人数已达到两百万。
    苏联各兄弟民族人民的全部物质和精神力量都有了蓬勃的发展和高涨。我们代表大会的讲坛是作家的兄弟友谊的讲坛，他们正在用不同的文字从事他们的创作，但是他们团结在一个共同的目标之下，这就是为建设共产主义而努力，为和平和各国之间的友谊而斗争。
    高尔基所说的话已经实现了，他说，“在第二次全苏作家代表大会上将有西方和东方的好几十个文学家，中国和印度的作家光临。”
    全世界的进步作家，我们的来自各人民民主国家和资本主义国家的朋友和来宾们给我们带来了他们的友谊和祝贺的话语，他们和我们一道发出了他们的呼声，要争取生、反对死，反对准备把各国人民拖入战争的罪恶势力的阴谋。
    正在腐朽的资本主义世界企图使人类陷入精神贫乏，道德堕落的状态。帝国主义的文学企图轻视人，激起卑劣的本能和抹煞高尔基的令人鼓舞的口号“人——这个字眼听起来多么令人感到自豪啊！”
    从我们的文学产生的时候起，我们的文学作品就充满了对人类和对人类的光辉未来的不可动摇的信心。它的主人翁的形象——为全人类的幸福而斗争的战士——已经深入各国普通人民的心。我们文学的力量在于它同整个生命、同人民的一切思想、感情和伟大行为以及同共产党的英雄斗争有着血肉相关的联系。苏联文学和伟大的十月社会主义革命的目的是分不开的。我们的多民族的文学史就是一幅社会主义制度发展的图画、是一幅人民的备尝艰苦的斗争的图画、是一幅在酷烈的斗争中获得伟大胜利的图画。
    苏联作家努力通过他们的长篇和短篇小说，诗和戏剧、韵文和歌曲来表现现实在它的革命发展中的真相。
    我们在第二次全苏作家代表大会上通过的苏联作家协会新会章中谈到了社会主义文学的崇高的使命：
    在从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的情况下，苏联文学所起的社会变革和积极教育的作用要大大加强。
    苏联文学必须以高度的艺术形式来显示共产主义思想的壮丽和伟大，有效地同人们思想中的资本主义残余作斗争，在它的主人翁的形象中反映他们的劳动生活、社会生活和私生活的多样性、大胆地揭露生活中的矛盾和冲突。苏联文学不仅要反映新事物而且还要尽力帮助它们赢得胜利。
    苏联文学必须以全副革命热情来培养苏联人民的爱国主义感情，来加强国际间的友谊，来帮助巩固强大的和平民主和社会主义阵营，维护无产阶级国际主义和劳动人民的兄弟团结的思想。
    我们的新会章中的这些话不仅表达了我们的愿望，并且也说明了苏联社会主义文学已经取得的成就。就是因为有这些特性我们的文学才受到它的广大读者——共产主义建设者——的热爱。就是这些特性才使我们的文学的许多作品成了苏维埃男女的终生的——无论在和平时期或在战争时期——朋友和伴侣。
    我们出席第二次全苏作家代表大会的代表们清楚地认识到，虽然我们的文学取得了成就，它还远不足以完成它的崇高的使命。社会主义国家的迅速发展的现实需要在不朽的作品中，在伟大的艺术力量的形象中体现出来。我们必须熟悉并且热爱我们的英雄的党的历史，我们新社会的历史。
    我们必须善于深刻地刻划新事物和旧的、陈腐的事物之间的斗争，肯定共产主义事业的壮丽和伟大，大胆地揭露生活中的矛盾和冲突。只有坚持不懈的和忘我的工作——一个真正的语言艺术家的工作就是这样的工作，再加上高度的文化修养和艺术修养才能使我们接近于满足我们的广大读者的精神要求和需要。
    社会主义现实主义是人类艺术发展史上的一个新阶段。今天，在苏联作家的作品能到达的一切国家，男工女工都了解这一点。我们的文学的思想和形象在全世界的影响，年年都在增长着。
    我们第二次全苏作家代表大会是在最严格的批评和自我批评的口号下进行的。不同世代和不同民族的作家一致主张要有高度的思想和艺术要求。但是，我们还没有为人民做到我们所能做的和应该做的工作。我们必须这样写作，要使青年和儿童把我们文学中的主人翁当作他们的同志、当作他们的模范！我们必须这样写作，要使我们的读者劳动者跟随我们所写的主人翁到创造性的劳动中去，到争取一个有着合理的和最好的人类关系的辉煌的新世界的到来的斗争中去！我们必须这样写作，要使世界最边远土地上的不幸的人们都听到我们这样的支持他们进行艰苦斗争的朋友和兄弟的声音；要使我们的声音像自由的赞美诗一样震响！
    社会主义现实主义的方法是作家充分发挥个性、采取多种风格和各种不同的创作趋向的竞赛的先决条件。必须坚持不懈地寻求新的艺术方法来最好地表现我们的思想的伟大真理和我们的生活的丰富和多样性。
    第二次全苏作家代表大会批评了我们的文学中的弱点和缺点，号召苏联一切文学家更加深入地发展俄国古典文学、苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟内的各兄弟国家人民的文学以及世界文学的最优秀的传统，大胆地肯定我们的苏维埃社会主义文学所形成的传统，并且创造性地研究我们外国朋友们的艺术技巧的有价值的经验。
    苏联作家们有责任坚定不移地改进在提拔和训练文学中的新人方面的一切工作，并且在这个极端重要的问题上遵守高尔基的遗训和传统。
    第二次全苏作家代表大会向苏联共产党中央委员会保证：团结在共产党周围的苏维埃知识分子和文学工作者的大军准备加倍努力实现人民的要求。
    第二次全苏作家代表大会是我国文学发展中的一个重要的历史性的里程碑。作家们有充分决心来大大改善他们的协会的活动、加强他们的队伍中的自我批评，清除各种形式的骄傲和自满，并且对技巧作严格的要求。作家们坚决要进行不断的斗争，以反对一切脱离社会主义现实主义的偏向，反对异己的资产阶级民族主义和世界主义思想的表现，反对资产阶级自然主义和形式主义的影响。
    苏联作家同他们自己的人民和党在同一个思想和感情下生活着、工作着。
    我们维护世界和平的事业，我们要用我们的一切力量来促进它的胜利。今天，天空再度弥漫着乌云。但是，如果有人犯下罪行，发动另一次战争，苏联作家们将忘我地为他们的社会主义祖国献出他们的才能、他们的艺术和他们的生命，正如他们在以希特勒独裁统治的毁灭告终的上次反德国法西斯战争中所做的一样。
    苏联共产党和它的中央委员会万岁！
    共产主义万岁！
