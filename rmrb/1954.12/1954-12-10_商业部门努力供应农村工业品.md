Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: Commercial departments in various locations are making every effort to prioritize the supply of industrial products suited to rural needs, in order to meet the demand of farmers for goods after selling grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops to the state.

The state-owned commercial departments plan to supply over 21% more industrial products in the fourth quarter of this year compared to the total sales of the same period last year. Most of these materials have already been transferred to state-owned stores or cooperatives in the counties. As of November 20th, the twelve specialized companies of the state-owned commercial departments had completed 49.7% of their fourth-quarter sales plans. Among them, hardware and machinery, transportation and electrical equipment, chemical raw materials, coal and building materials, salt, and medicine companies have performed relatively well. The sales volume of cotton cloth among the commodities supplied by the state plan is increasing week by week. Recently, the China Coal and Building Materials Company decided to transfer coal saved in cities to rural areas. The supply of coal to rural areas in the fourth quarter will increase by 300,000 to 500,000 tons compared to the original plan.

State-owned companies in cities with relatively concentrated light industry, such as Shanghai and Tianjin, including department stores, medicine, and hardware and machinery companies, dispatched dozens of visiting sales teams in September and October, carrying samples to visit various parts of the country. These visiting sales teams participated in local materials exchange fairs, held sample exhibitions, convened symposiums for grassroots unit salespersons and consumers, and signed supplementary supply contracts with local sales units, greatly enriching the supply of goods in state-owned stores and cooperatives in various regions. At the materials exchange fair held by the Beijing Municipal State-owned Commercial Department at the end of November, 90% of the total value of the goods traded were industrial and handicraft products suitable for rural needs. The industrial products supplied to rural areas by state-owned commercial departments in the Northeast provinces this year are not only large in quantity but also adapted to the local climate and the needs of farmers. Felt socks, felt hat brims, long-waisted felt boots, felt lumps, and cotton-rubber shoes, which are popular among farmers in Jilin Province, have been organized by the state-owned commercial departments of Jilin Province in October for local processing by handicraft workers in various counties. From October 1st to November 20th, Wuhan City transferred more than 35,000 tons of industrial products to rural areas in Hubei. In addition to general daily-use industrial products, some of these commodities are the most needed wire, round nails, and timber for disaster-stricken people in Hubei to rebuild their homes and repair their houses.

Currently, materials exchange fairs at the primary market level, focusing on the promotion of industrial products, handicraft products, and small local products, are being widely held in various regions. These exchange fairs are jointly led by local state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives, and small vendors are encouraged to participate. The Leshan Special District of Sichuan Province, a grain-rich area, has held 214 materials exchange fairs. The materials exchange fairs held in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Shanxi, and other provinces have achieved good results.

    商业部门努力供应农村工业品
    【新华社九日讯】各地国营商业部门正在尽一切努力，把适应农村需要的工业品优先供应农村，以满足农民在向国家出售粮食、棉花和油料后对于商品的需要。
    国营商业部门今年第四季度准备供应的工业品比去年同期销售总数增加百分之二十一以上，这些物资大都已调到县的国营商店或合作社。到十一月二十日止，国营商业部门的十二个专业公司已完成第四季度销售计划的百分之四十九点七。其中五金机械、交通电工器材、化工原料、煤业建筑器材、盐业、医药等八个公司完成较好。国家计划供应的商品中，棉布的销售量正逐旬增多。最近中国煤业建筑器材公司已决定把城市节省下来的煤调到农村去。第四季度供应农村的煤将要比原计划增加三十万吨到五十万吨。
    轻工业较为集中的上海、天津等大城市的百货、医药、五金机械等国营公司采购供应单位，早在九、十月间就先后派出数十个访问推销队，携带样品，分别到全国各地访问。这些访问推销队参加了各地的物资交流会，举办了样品展览会，召开了基层单位营业员和消费者座谈会，并和各地销售单位签订了补充供应合同，使各地国营商店和合作社的货源大大充实。十一月底北京市国营商业部门举办的物资交流会上，成交的商品总值中，有百分之九十是适合农村需要的工业品和手工业品。东北各省国营商业部门今年供应农村的工业品不但数量多，并且适应当地的气候和农民的需要。吉林省农民喜爱的毡袜、毡帽头、长腰毡靴、毡疙瘩和棉胶鞋等，都已由吉林省的国营商业部门在十月间组织各县手工业者就地加工。从十月一日到十一月二十日，武汉市调到湖北各地农村的工业品已有三万五千多吨。这些商品除了一般日用工业品外，有一部分是湖北灾民重建家园、修理房屋最需要的铁丝、圆钉和木材等。
    现在各地正在广泛举行以推销工业品、手工业品和小土产品为主的初级市场的物资交流会。这些交流会都由当地国营商业部门和合作社共同领导，吸收小商贩参加。粮食丰产区四川省乐山专区已举行了物资交流会二百一十四次。江苏、浙江、四川、山西等省举行的物资交流会，已收到很好效果。
