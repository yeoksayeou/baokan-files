    Pay Attention to Cold-Proof Packaging of Medicines
    Readers Xie Guixiang and Wang Zhaoxiang wrote: The Qiqihar warehouse of Heilongjiang Provincial Pharmaceutical Company has discovered a serious problem of frozen medicines in the goods received from various pharmaceutical units. On November 25th, thirty-four pieces of injectable medicine sent by the Veterinary Pharmaceutical Room of Liaoxi Veterinary Hospital were all frozen. After being melted upon entering the warehouse, it was found that the injection liquid had deteriorated. On November 30th, five hundred bottles of red mercury water sent by the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Procurement and Supply Station via "slow mail" were all frozen due to improper packaging, and more than thirty bottles were even cracked. On December 5th, we received fifty-three pieces of medicine sent from the Sujiatun warehouse of the Shenyang Pharmaceutical Procurement and Supply Station. Inspection revealed that some of the medicines were frozen. In addition, medicines sent to us by Liaodong Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory and other units were also damaged.
    Since the beginning of winter this year, the China Pharmaceutical Company has repeatedly instructed various regions to pay attention to the cold-proof packaging of medicines. However, some pharmaceutical units still have not paid attention to this issue. In particular, some units have not strengthened the packaging of medicines according to the different climates of various regions. We hope that pharmaceutical units in various regions will pay attention to improving this work.

    注意药品的防寒包装
    读者谢贵祥、王肇祥来信：黑龙江省医药公司齐齐哈尔仓库在接受各地医药单位的进货中，发现药品冻坏的现象十分严重。十一月二十五日，辽西兽医院制药室发来三十四件注射药全部冻了，经入库溶化后发现注射液变了质。十一月三十日，天津医药采购供应站用“慢件”发来的红汞水五百瓶，由于包装不善都冻坏了，并且有三十多瓶连瓶子都已经冻裂了。十二月五日，我们收到沈阳医药采购供应站苏家屯仓库发来的五十三件药品，经检查发现部分药品有冻坏的现象。此外，辽东化学制药厂以及其他单位寄发给我们的药品也有损坏的现象。
    今年入冬以来，中国医药公司就一再指示各地重视药品的防寒包装工作，但是至今仍有一些医药单位没有引起重视，特别是有的单位没有根据各地气候不同的情况，加强药品的包装工作。我们希望各地医药单位注意改进这一工作。
