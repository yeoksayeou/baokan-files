Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 28th: An Indonesian Foreign Ministry source spoke to the press on the 27th regarding the South Asian Five-Nation Prime Ministers' Conference, saying that the Bogor Conference would discuss issues related to political, economic, and cultural cooperation, as well as the Asian-African Conference and its agenda.

The Foreign Ministry source said that the five prime ministers would focus on the issue of colonialism in the world, especially in Asia. This issue cannot but be considered a matter of common interest. For example, the issue of foreign troops invading the Burmese border, the Arab refugee issue, the racial policies of the Union of South Africa, the West Irian issue, and so on. All these issues constantly and directly disturb neighboring countries. These countries all believe that it is necessary to stabilize the political situation and achieve peace.

The Foreign Ministry source said that the five prime ministers will also discuss issues of economic and cultural cooperation. In order to discuss broader cooperation issues, it is necessary to hold a wider conference. This conference is the Asian-African Conference. In order for the Asian-African Conference to achieve the greatest success, Indonesia believes that it is very necessary to submit the agenda of the Asian-African Conference to the Bogor Conference for joint decision-making. The main purpose of the Asian-African Conference is to determine the positive policies of Asian and African countries in order to contribute to the world's, especially Asia's, peace and progress. To achieve this goal, international cooperation among all countries and nations in a peaceful atmosphere and peaceful coexistence is necessary.

The Foreign Ministry source said that colonialism is as dangerous to Indonesia as it is to international peace. It is extremely unjust and inhumane to allow colonialism to continue to run rampant in certain regions of the world – including Indonesia.

The Foreign Ministry source also said that Indonesia will pursue a positive and independent foreign policy and a good-neighbor policy aimed at achieving world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 28th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, and Pakistani Prime Minister Ali, who are attending the South Asian Five-Nation Prime Ministers' Conference (scheduled to be held in Bogor, south of Jakarta, on the 28th), arrived in Jakarta on the 27th.

Those who welcomed them at the airport included Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo, many ministers of the Indonesian government, as well as leaders of political circles and people's organizations.

Soviet Ambassador Zhukov and Chinese Ambassador Huang Zhen also went to the airport to welcome them. Indonesian President Sukarno then received the three prime ministers at the Independence Palace. As the Prime Ministers drove from the airport to the Independence Palace, they were greeted by cheering crowds.

    印度尼西亚外交部人士谈茂物会议议程
    印、缅、巴三国总理已到达雅加达
    【新华社雅加达二十八日电】印度尼西亚外交部人士二十七日就南亚五国总理会议对报界发表谈话说，茂物会议将讨论关于政治、经济和文化合作的问题，亚非会议及其议程的问题。
    外交部人士说，五国总理将着重讨论世界上的殖民主义问题，特别是亚洲的殖民主义问题。这个问题不能不被认为是共同利益的问题。例如，外国军队侵入缅甸边境的问题、阿拉伯难民问题、南非联邦种族政策问题、西伊里安问题等等。所有这些问题，不断地而且直接地使毗邻的国家感到不安。这些国家都认为有必要稳定政治局势，实现和平。
    外交部人士说，五国总理还将讨论经济和文化方面的合作问题。为了讨论更广泛的合作问题，举行一次广泛性的会议是必要的。这个会议就是亚非会议。为了使亚非会议能获得最大的成就，印度尼西亚认为，向茂物会议提出亚非会议的议程以便作出共同决定是非常必要的。亚非会议主要的是决定亚洲非洲国家的积极政策，以便对世界的特别是亚洲的和平和进步有所贡献。为了达到这个目的，所有国家和民族在和平气氛与和平共处中进行国际合作是必要的。
    外交部人士说，殖民主义对于印度尼西亚跟对于国际和平是一样地危险。让殖民主义在世界的某些地区——包括印度尼西亚——继续猖獗是极其不正当和不人道的。
    外交部人士还说，印度尼西亚将奉行旨在实现世界和平的积极的独立政策和睦邻政策。
    【新华社雅加达二十八日电】出席南亚五国总理会议（定于二十八日在雅加达以南的茂物举行）的印度总理尼赫鲁、缅甸总理吴努和巴基斯坦总理阿里已在二十七日到达雅加达。
