Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 13th: Various tasks serving the large state-owned grain farm have commenced near the farm site.

    The road from Fulitun to Xinglongzhen will be rebuilt into a solid and smooth gravel road to ensure that heavy-duty trucks transporting materials and grain for the farm can pass unimpeded in the future. Currently, a group of surveyors dispatched by the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government Department of Transportation are conducting measurements on this road. They are striving to complete the survey by the 15th. A portion of the staff dispatched by the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government Department of Transportation are surveying locations for quarrying stone in the mountains near the farm.

    Telecommunications engineering workers dispatched by the Heilongjiang Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau are digging pits along the main road from Xinglongzhen to Jixian County, preparing to bury utility poles and erect telephone and telegraph lines. A post and telecommunications office with telegraph and long-distance telephone services will be opened for the farm in Xinglongzhen. This work is expected to be completed around the end of December.

    To meet the needs of the farm's basic construction, the Local Industry Section of the Jixian County People's Government has dispatched personnel to select a site for a brick kiln in the Sandaogang area and recently sent personnel to Harbin, Jiamusi, and other cities to organize and recruit brick-burning workers, as well as to test soil samples taken from the Sandaogang area.

    Not long ago, staff members from the First Engineering Company of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government Department of Construction came to Fulitun and Xinglongzhen to inspect the site and understand the requirements and opinions of the farm负责人 [fù zé rén - person in charge/responsible person] and Soviet experts regarding the farm's basic construction. This engineering company will undertake the construction of the farm's buildings.

    大型农场附近修筑公路并安置邮电设备
    【新华社哈尔滨十三日电】为大型国营谷物农场服务的各项工作，已在农场场地附近开始进行。
    从福利屯到兴隆镇的公路，将改修成坚固平坦的砂石路，好使将来农场运输物资、粮食的载重汽车畅通无阻。目前一群由黑龙江省人民政府交通厅派出的勘测人员，正在这条公路上进行测量。他们争取在十五日前测量完毕。黑龙江省人民政府交通厅派出的一部分工作人员，正在农场附近的山上勘察采取石材的地方。
    黑龙江省邮电管理局派出的电讯工程工人，正在兴隆镇到集贤县城的大路旁挖坑，准备埋电线杆，架设电话线和电报线。在兴隆镇上，将为农场开办一个设有电报和长途电话的邮电所。这项工作预计在十二月底前后可以完成。
    为供应农场基本建设的需要，集贤县人民政府地方工业科已派人在三道岗地区选择了设砖窑的地址，最近又派人去哈尔滨、佳木斯等城市组织和招聘烧砖的工人，以及化验由三道岗地区取出的土样。
    不久以前，黑龙江省人民政府建设厅第一工程公司的工作人员来到福利屯和兴隆镇，察看了场地，了解了农场负责人和苏联专家对于农场基本建设的要求和意见。这个工程公司将承担农场房舍的建筑工作。
