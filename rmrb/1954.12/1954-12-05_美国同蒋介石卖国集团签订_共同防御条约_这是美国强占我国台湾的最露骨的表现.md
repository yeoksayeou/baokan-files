Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: The so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed in Washington this month on the 2nd by the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the most blatant manifestation of the U.S. aggressive group's consistent policy of occupying China's territory of Taiwan, antagonizing the Chinese people, and preparing to expand the war. It is also the most shameless of the traitorous treaties ever signed by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

This treaty has ten articles and a preamble.

The preamble to the treaty includes a host of lies to mask the United States' aggressive intentions. The preamble states that the contracting parties reaffirm their "faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all governments, and desiring to strengthen the institutions of peace in the Western Pacific Area." This is a complete and utter lie. The United States, through the U.S.-Chiang treaty, indefinitely occupies China's territory of Taiwan and openly declares that it will use force to interfere in China's internal affairs and wage war against the People's Republic of China, which is a complete violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. As for the so-called hope of both contracting parties to "strengthen the institutions of peace in the Western Pacific Area," people know that the United States has never established any "institutions of peace" in the Western Pacific region. On the contrary, it has established a series of aggressive military blocs—the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and aggressive bilateral treaties concluded by the United States with the Rhee Syngman group, the Philippines, and other countries. The United States attempts to establish a military aggression system controlled by the United States in the Western Pacific region through this series of treaties. The U.S.-Chiang treaty is obviously not for enhancing any peace institutions in this region but to strengthen the system of military aggression blocs planned by the United States.

The preamble also "publicly and formally declares" the common determination of the U.S. and Chiang to "defend themselves against external armed attack" and "willingness to strengthen existing efforts of collective defense to maintain peace and security." Here, the hypocrisy of the so-called "peaceful coexistence" and "enhanced peace institutions" is completely exposed. The original purpose of signing this treaty is, among other things, to "resist external armed attacks," that is, to oppose the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. However, the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair. The Chinese people attacking the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique on Chinese territory on Chinese territory cannot be described as a so-called "external armed attack" no matter what the reason. Obviously, the United States' obstruction of the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is interference in China's internal affairs. This act of aggression by the United States has nothing in common with "maintaining peace and security."

Article 1 of the treaty states: "The Contracting Parties undertake, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, to settle any international disputes in which they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and justice are not endangered, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations." This article is merely a decoration common in many aggressive treaties signed by the United States. In fact, the United States' record of launching the Korean War and long-term occupation of Taiwan has already shown the people of the world what its so-called "peaceful means" and "in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations" mean. Moreover, after the explanation by Shen Changhuan, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Chiang gang, it is made clearer that there are no restrictions on the Chiang Kai-shek traitors attacking the mainland, but the Chinese people are not allowed to liberate Taiwan and Penghu themselves.

Article 2 of the treaty states: "In order more effectively to achieve the objectives of this Treaty, the Parties separately, and jointly by means of self-help and mutual aid will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack and communist subversive activities directed from without against their territorial integrity and political stability." This is the most important article in this treaty. In a nutshell, it is to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and Penghu. To achieve this goal, the United States will step up its military assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and will also intervene with armed force when the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is attacked. In addition, the United States will also try its best to support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to strengthen its brutal rule and prevent this lifeless political zombie from completely collapsing under the angry resistance of the people of Taiwan.

Article 3 of the treaty states: "The Parties undertake to strengthen their free institutions and to cooperate with each other in the development of their economic progress and social well-being and to enhance their individual and collective efforts to achieve these purposes." No one does not know that Taiwan under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a world where secret agents run rampant. The so-called "strengthening of their free institutions" is actually strengthening the rule of the police and secret agents. As for the so-called U.S.-Chiang "cooperation to develop economic progress and social welfare," it is nothing more than the U.S. aggressive group's further plunder of Taiwan's economic resources and sucking the marrow of the people of Taiwan.

Article 4 of the treaty stipulates that the U.S. and Chiang will "consult together from time to time regarding the implementation of this Treaty." The provision of this article is actually to facilitate the United States to use this treaty at any time to carry out its policy of aggressive war.

Article 5 of the treaty states: "Each Party recognizes that an armed attack in the West Pacific Area directed against the territories of either of the Parties would be dangerous to its own peace and safety, and declares that it would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes." This is a public declaration that if the Chinese people want to liberate Taiwan, the United States will take action against the Chinese people, that is, to wage war. Not only that, but this article also stipulates: "Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall be immediately reported to the Security Council of the United Nations. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security." This more thoroughly exposes the United States' intention to replay the old trick of aggression against Korea; manipulating the United Nations to force other countries to follow it in waging a war against the Chinese people and expanding the war.

Article 6 of the treaty stipulates: "For the purposes of Articles II and V, the term 'territory' means, in respect of the Republic of China, Taiwan and the Pescadores; and in respect of the United States of America, the island territories in the West Pacific Area under its jurisdiction. The provisions of Articles II and V will be applicable to such other territories as may be determined by mutual agreement." This is an extremely important and extremely blatant article in this treaty. According to the explanation of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Chiang gang's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shen Changhuan, the so-called "other territories" not only refer to the coastal islands now occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, but also refer to the liberated Chinese mainland. This proves that the U.S. aggressive group can expand its aggressive acts of invading Chinese territory from Taiwan and Penghu to Chinese coastal islands and even the Chinese mainland at any time. This article exposes the long-term goal of the U.S. aggressive group in signing this treaty is to support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to restore its rule in the whole of China, thereby turning the whole of China into a U.S. colony.

Article 7 of the treaty states: "The Government of the Republic of China grants, and the United States of America accepts, the right to deploy United States land, sea, and air forces in and about Taiwan and the Pescadores as may be required for their defense, as determined by mutual agreement." This actually completely allows the United States military to occupy these territories of the Chinese people, making them a springboard for the United States to further invade the Chinese mainland. It is particularly noteworthy that the U.S. occupying forces include land forces in addition to the naval and air forces that are often stationed in Taiwan and Penghu.

Article 8 of the treaty states: "This Treaty does not affect and shall not be interpreted as affecting in any way the rights and obligations of the Parties under the Charter of the United Nations, or the responsibility of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security." This actually means that the United States is not affected by the U.S.-Chiang treaty when it uses the name of the United Nations to carry out aggression in other places.

Article 9 of the treaty stipulates that the U.S.-Chiang treaty shall be "ratified in accordance with their respective constitutional processes" by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and shall "enter into force when instruments of ratification are exchanged at Taipei."

Article 10 of the treaty stipulates: "This Treaty shall remain in force indefinitely." This means that the United States will use this treaty as a basis to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu indefinitely and use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as a tool for waging wars against the Chinese people and provoking world wars.

All in all, this treaty, all ten articles plus the preamble, thoroughly exposes itself as a bandit treaty that invades Chinese territory, undermines Chinese sovereignty, and interferes in China's internal affairs, and a war treaty that violates the purposes of the United Nations, violates the Charter of the United Nations, and undermines peace and security in Asia and the world.

    美国同蒋介石卖国集团签订“共同防御条约”
    这是美国强占我国台湾的最露骨的表现
    【新华社四日讯】本月二日美国政府和蒋介石卖国集团在华盛顿签订的所谓“共同防御条约”是美国侵略集团一贯地侵占中国领土台湾、敌视中国人民、准备扩大战争的政策的最露骨的表现，也是蒋介石卖国集团所曾经签订过的卖国条约中最无耻的一个条约。
    这个条约共有十条，前面有一个序言。
    条约的序言包括了一大堆掩饰美国的侵略意图的谎话。序言说，缔约国重申它们“对联合国宪章之宗旨与原则之信心及其与所有人民及政府和平相处之愿望，并欲增强在近西太平洋区域之和平机构”。这是彻头彻尾的谎话。美国通过美蒋条约无限期侵占中国的领土台湾，而且公开宣布要用武力来干涉中国的内政，要与中华人民共和国作战，这完全是违反联合国宪章的宗旨与原则的行为。至于所谓缔约国双方希望“增强西太平洋区域之和平机构”，人们知道，美国在西太平洋地区从来没有建立过什么“和平机构”，反之，它已经建立了一系列的侵略性的军事集团——东南亚公约集团以及美国和李承晚集团、菲律宾等国家订立的侵略性的双边条约，美国企图通过这一系列条约在西太平洋地区建立一个由美国控制的军事侵略体系。美蒋条约显然不是为了增强这个地区的什么和平机构，而是为了增强美国所策划的军事侵略集团的体系。
    序言还“公开和正式宣布”了美蒋双方为“自卫而抵御外来武装攻击的共同决心”，“并愿加强两国为维护和平和安全而建立集体防御的现有努力”。这里就完全暴露了所谓“和平相处”、“增强之和平机构”的虚伪性。原来签订这个条约的目的之一就是所谓“抵御外来武装攻击”，也就是说反对中国人民解放台湾。但是中国人民要解放台湾是中国内部的事情。在中国领土上的中国人民进攻在中国领土上的蒋介石卖国集团，无论用什么理由也不能说明这是所谓“外来武装攻击”。很明显，美国阻挠中国人民解放台湾，就是干涉中国的内政。美国这种侵略行为，与“维护和平和安全”毫无共同之点。
    条约的第一条说：“本条约缔约国承允依照联合国宪章之规定，以不使危及国际和平安全与正义之和平方法解决可能牵涉两国之任何国际争议，并在其国际关系中不以任何与联合国宗旨相悖之方式进行武力威胁或使用武力。”这一条不过是美国在它所签订的许多侵略性的条约中共有的一种装饰。事实上，美国发动朝鲜战争和长期侵占台湾的记录已经在全世界人民面前表明了它的所谓“和平方法”和“不以任何与联合国宗旨相悖之方式”到底意味着什么。并且这一条文经过蒋贼外交部次长沈昌焕的解释，更清楚地表明对蒋介石卖国贼进攻大陆并无任何限制，却不许中国人民自己来解放台湾和澎湖。
    条约的第二条说：“为期更有效达成本条约之目的起见，缔约国将个别并联合以自助及互助之方式维持并发展其个别及集体之能力，以抵抗武装攻击及由国外指挥之危害其领土完整与政治安定之共党颠覆活动。”这是这个条约中最重要的一条。一言以蔽之就是：阻挠中国人民解放台湾和澎湖。为了达到这个目的，美国就要加紧对蒋介石卖国集团的军事援助，而且还要在蒋介石卖国集团受到攻击时出而进行武装干涉。此外，美国还要竭力扶植蒋介石卖国集团加强其暴虐统治，防止这具已经没有生命力的政治僵尸在台湾人民愤怒的反抗下完全垮台。
    条约的第三条说：“缔约国承允加强其自由制度，彼此合作以发展其经济进步与社会福利，并为达到此等目的而增强其个别与集体之努力。”没有人不知道，蒋介石卖国集团统治下的台湾是一个特务横行的世界，所谓“加强其自由制度”，实际上就是加强警察和特务统治。至于所谓美蒋“合作以发展经济进步和社会福利”，不过是美国侵略集团进一步掠夺台湾经济资源和吸吮台湾人民膏血而已。
    条约第四条规定美蒋之间“就本条约之实施随时会商”。这一条的规定实际上为了使美国便于随时利用这个条约来遂行其侵略战争政策。
    条约第五条说：“每一缔约国承认，对在西太平洋区域内任一缔约国之领土上之武装攻击即将危及其本身之和平与安全，兹并宣告将依其宪法程序采取行动，以对付此共同危险。”这就是公开宣布，如果中国人民要解放台湾，美国就要对中国人民采取行动，也就是进行战争。不但如此，这一条还规定：“任何此项武装攻击及因而采取之一切措施应立即报告联合国安全理事会。此等措施应于安全理事会采取恢复并维持国际和平与安全之必要措施时予以终止。”这更彻底暴露了美国想重演侵略朝鲜的故技；操纵联合国来强迫其他国家跟着它一道来进行反对中国人民的战争，并且把战争扩大。
    条约第六条规定：“为适用于第二条及第五条之目的，所有‘领土’等辞就中华民国而言，应指台湾与澎湖；就美利坚合众国而言，应指西太平洋区域内在其管辖下之各岛屿领土。第二条及第五条之规定并将适用于经共同协议所决定之其他领土。”这是这个条约中极为重要而且极为露骨的一条。据美国国务卿杜勒斯和蒋贼外交部次长沈昌焕的解释，所谓“其他领土”不但是指现在被蒋介石卖国集团盘踞着的沿海岛屿，而且是指已经解放了的中国大陆。这就证明美国侵略集团随时可以把它的侵占中国领土的侵略行为从台湾和澎湖扩大到中国沿海岛屿直到中国大陆。这一条暴露了美国侵略集团签订这一个条约的长远目的是要支持蒋介石卖国集团在全中国复辟，从而把全中国变为美国的殖民地。
    条约的第七条说：“中华民国政府给予，美利坚合众国接受，依共同协议之决定在台湾、澎湖及其附近为其防卫所需要而部署美国陆海空军之权利。”这实际上就是把中国人民的这些领土完全听任美国军队占领，把它们作为美国进而侵略中国大陆的跳板。特别值得注意的是美国的占领部队中除了现在台湾和澎湖经常驻扎的海、空军外还包括陆军。
    条约第八条说：“本条约并不影响且不应被解释为影响缔约国在联合国宪章下之权利及义务，或联合国为维持国际和平和安全所负之责任。”这实际上就是说，美国在其他地方利用联合国名义进行侵略时，不受美蒋条约的影响。
    条约第九条规定：美蒋条约应由美国和蒋介石卖国集团“按照各自宪法程序批准”，并将于“在台北交换本条约批准书时生效”。
    条约第十条规定：“本条约将无限期有效”。这就是说，美国将以这一条约为根据，无限期侵占中国的领土台湾和澎湖，并利用蒋介石卖国集团作为进行反对中国人民的战争和挑起世界大战的工具。
    总而言之，这个条约全部十条本文外加序文彻头彻尾地暴露了它自己是一个侵略中国领土、破坏中国主权，干涉中国内政的强盗条约，是一个违背联合国宗旨，违反联合国宪章，破坏亚洲和世界的和平和安全的战争条约。
