The symposium on the criticism of Hu Shih's thought, jointly convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Writers Association, officially began on the 29th, with the first discussion sessions held on "Criticism of Hu Shih's Philosophical Thought" and "The People's Nature and Artistic Achievements of Dream of the Red Chamber."

	The discussion on "Criticism of Hu Shih's Philosophical Thought" was held at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Participants and attendees included Guo Moruo, Pan Zinian, Ai Siqi, Hu Sheng, Shao Quanlin, Jin Yuelin, Feng Youlan, Wang Ziye, He Sijing, Ma Te, and other figures from the capital's academic and cultural circles. Figures from the natural sciences, such as Qian Sanqiang, Zeng Zhaolun, Zhao Jiuzhang, Yang Zhongjian, and Peng Huanwu, were also invited to participate. The meeting was presided over by Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Director of the "Working Committee of the Symposium on the Criticism of Hu Shih's Thought."

	The discussion began with Ai Siqi reporting on the main points of his essay "Criticism of Hu Shih's Pragmatism." He made a comprehensive analysis and criticism of the basic propositions of the "pragmatism" philosophy peddled by Hu Shih, namely, the viewpoint of subjective idealism and its epistemology, theory of truth, methodology, and vulgar evolutionism. He also elaborated on how Hu Shih's reactionary philosophical thought was reflected in his reactionary politics. Ai Siqi pointed out that "pragmatism" was originally a reactionary philosophical thought of the American bourgeoisie, belonging to the most corrupt trend of subjective idealism of the bourgeoisie during the imperialist period. Hu Shih peddled "pragmatism" to China during the May Fourth Movement, hoping to use "pragmatism" to resist dialectical materialism. Hu Shih's promotion of "pragmatism" was linked to his reactionary political stance from the very beginning.

	Subsequently, Ma Te, Jin Yuelin, Feng Youlan, He Sijing, and others put forward supplementary arguments and opinions on Ai Siqi's report. This discussion will continue.

	The discussion on "The People's Nature and Artistic Achievements of Dream of the Red Chamber" was held at the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Participants and attendees included Mao Dun, Zhang Tianyi, Wang Kunlun, Wu Zuxiang, Xie Bingxin, Nie Gannu, Lin Mohan, Wang Chongwu, Jiang Muliang, Lan Ling, Lin Geng, Yu Pingbo, Li Yang, Li Changzhi, Shu Wu, and more than 120 other figures from the capital's literary, artistic, and academic circles. The meeting was presided over by Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association and member of the "Working Committee of the Symposium on the Criticism of Hu Shih's Thought."

	The discussion mainly focused on the article "The Social Background of the Emergence of Dream of the Red Chamber and Its Tendencies" by Zeng Xiankai of the Chinese History Teaching and Research Office of Renmin University of China. Shang Yue, Director of the Chinese History Teaching and Research Office of Renmin University of China, made a supplementary report on this paper at the meeting. Shang Yue discussed the emergence of capitalist sprouts in Chinese history, and described the social and economic conditions and the development of industry and commerce in the Yuan and Ming dynasties.

	In the next discussion session, Shang Yue will continue to make supplementary reports, and discussions will continue.

    胡适思想批判讨论会开始举行
    中国科学院、中国作家协会联合召开的胡适思想批判讨论会二十九日正式开始，分别举行了关于“胡适的哲学思想批判”和“红楼梦的人民性和艺术成就”两个方面的第一次讨论会。
      “胡适的哲学思想批判”讨论会在中国科学院举行。参加和列席讨论会的有首都学术、文教界人士郭沫若、潘梓年、艾思奇、胡绳、邵荃麟、金岳霖、冯友兰、王子野、何思敬、马特等。自然科学界人士钱三强、曾昭抡、赵九章、杨锺健、彭桓武等也应邀参加。会议由中国科学院院长、“胡适思想批判讨论会”工作委员会主任郭沫若主持。
    讨论会首先由艾思奇报告了他所写的“批判胡适的实用主义”论文的要点。他就胡适所贩卖的“实用主义”哲学的基本命题，即主观唯心论的观点和认识论、真理论、方法论及庸俗进化论等方面作了全面的分析和批判，并就胡适反动的哲学思想反映到反动的政治方面作了阐述。艾思奇指出：“实用主义”原是美国资产阶级的反动的哲学思想，它是属于帝国主义时期资产阶级最腐朽的主观唯心论的潮流。胡适在“五四”运动期间把“实用主义”贩到中国来，指望用“实用主义”来对抗唯物辩证法。胡适的宣传“实用主义”，一开始就和他的反动的政治立场联系着。
    接着，马特、金岳霖、冯友兰、何思敬等就艾思奇的报告提出了补充的论点和意见。这个讨论会将继续进行。
    “红楼梦的人民性和艺术成就”讨论会在中国文学艺术界联合会举行。参加和列席讨论会的，有首都文艺、学术界人士茅盾、张天翼、王昆仑、吴组缃、谢冰心、聂绀弩、林默涵、王崇武、蒋牧良、蓝翎、林庚、俞平伯、力扬、李长之、舒芜等一百二十多人。会议由中国作家协会主席、“胡适思想批判讨论会”工作委员会委员茅盾主持。
    讨论会主要讨论中国人民大学中国历史教研室曾宪楷所作的“红楼梦产生的社会背景和它的倾向性”一文，中国人民大学中国历史教研室主任尚钺在会上就这篇论文作了补充报告。尚钺论述了资本主义萌芽在中国历史上的出现，叙述了元、明两代的社会经济情况和工商业的发展。
    下一次的讨论会，将继续由尚钺作补充报告，并进行讨论。
