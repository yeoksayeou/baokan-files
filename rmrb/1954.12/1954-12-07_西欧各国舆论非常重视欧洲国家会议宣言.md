    Western European Public Opinion Attaches Great Importance to the Declaration of the European Countries Conference

    France
    The French public is very concerned about the European countries conference held in Moscow, which closed on the 3rd. The conference declaration is the focus of French public opinion. “L'Humanité” reported the conference declaration in detail and published an editorial stating: In view of the decisions made at the Moscow conference, the French people's struggle against the ratification of the Paris Agreements is of particular significance. The newspaper said: "The Moscow conference declaration clearly shows what the consequences of ratifying or rejecting the Paris Agreements will be. The Moscow conference declaration provides new opportunities for negotiations to promote peace and warns the people of the world of the serious threat posed by the revival of German militarism."
    "Libération" wrote: "Hope still exists. The Eastern countries gathered together have put forward a new proposal. They have issued a new warning and firmly demand that we and they jointly organize some kind of collective security, so that we can be spared from the renewed threat of Germany and from the poverty that comes with the arms race." The newspaper concluded: "In Moscow, everything has been said so solemnly and clearly that there is no room for distorting the truth." However, bourgeois newspapers only published very brief news about the conference.
    "Combat" believes that if the Paris Agreements are ratified, the result of the Moscow conference will be "to unify and strengthen the armed forces of the Communist Party."
    "L'Aurore" published a message about the representatives of the European countries conference signing the declaration, with the title "The armed forces of the Soviet bloc are unified under a single command." At the same time, the newspaper pointed out that "the door to negotiations remains open."

    Italy
    Italian progressive newspapers attach great importance to the declaration issued by the European countries on guaranteeing European peace and security. "l'Unità" published an article saying: "Arming West Germany will make it impossible to resolve the disputed issues," "The Moscow conference issued a solemn warning to Western countries at its conclusion: once the Paris Agreements for arming Germany are ratified, the participating countries will take effective steps to defend themselves."
    "Il Paese" and "Avanti!" prominently published many paragraphs from the declaration. "Il Paese" said that the declaration is "a document of particular significance," which "expresses a strong and concrete attitude towards the possible ratification of the Paris Agreements by Western countries," "and at the same time, it opens the door to international negotiations and the reaching of peaceful agreements in the event that the West decides to postpone ratification of the Paris Agreements."

    Netherlands
    The "De Waarheid" in The Hague, Netherlands, published an article by Paul de Groot, General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, commenting on the closing of the European countries conference on guaranteeing European peace and security.
    De Groot pointed out that the measures formulated by the eight countries participating in the Moscow conference are not only to defend their own interests, but also to defend the people of Western Europe, including the Dutch people, from the powerful means of fascist aggression.
    De Groot exposed the sinister plans of the American imperialists, pointing out that the governments of Western countries, under the pressure of American imperialists, are betraying the interests of their own people. He said that recently, especially after the Moscow conference, not only the working people, but even bourgeois politicians have begun to understand that following the policies imposed by Washington is tantamount to heading towards suicide.
    De Groot demanded that the Dutch Parliament reject the Paris Agreements, saying that the Netherlands should insist on a main principle: negotiations on the establishment of a European collective security system must be conducted before the issue of ratification is raised.

    Belgium
    Belgian newspapers reported the closing of the European countries conference on guaranteeing European peace and security held in Moscow and the passage of the declaration. "La Libre Belgique" emphasized that the declaration called on all European countries to jointly consider the possibility of establishing a European collective security system and to discuss what common steps can be taken to lay a solid foundation for peace on the European continent.
    "Le Drapeau Rouge" published a lengthy article commenting on the closing of the Moscow conference. The title of the article is: "The Moscow Conference Concludes, Issuing a Stern Warning to Western Countries: Arming Bonn will force the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic Countries to jointly organize and strengthen their defenses." "Le Drapeau Rouge" said that the Moscow conference's stern warning confronts the Belgian government with the following choice: "Either pursue a policy of arming German revanchists regardless of the danger it brings to Belgium; or pursue a policy of establishing collective security, reducing armaments, and easing international tensions."

    西欧各国舆论非常重视欧洲国家会议宣言
    法国
    法国公众非常关心在莫斯科举行、已在三日闭幕的欧洲国家会议。会议宣言是法国舆论注意的中心。“人道报”详细地报道了会议宣言，并且发表社论说：鉴于莫斯科会议作出了决定，法国人民反对批准巴黎协定的斗争日益具有特别重大的意义。报纸说：“莫斯科会议宣言清楚说明：批准或拒绝巴黎协定会产生什么后果。莫斯科会议宣言提供了谈判促进和平的新机会，并且把德国军国主义复活所引起的严重威胁向全世界人民提出了警告。”
    “解放报”写道：“希望是仍然存在的。聚集在一起的东方国家提出的是一项新的建议。它们发出了一个新的警告，并且坚决要求我们和他们一起来组织某种集体安全，使我们免受德国再度威胁，免受随着军备竞赛而来的穷困的影响。”这家报纸最后写道：“在莫斯科，人们已经把一切都说得这样郑重而明确，再也没有歪曲真相的余地了”。可是 资产阶级报纸只登载了非常简短的会议消息。
    “战斗报”认为，如果巴黎协定获得批准的话，那么莫斯科会议的结果将是“统一和加强共产党的武装部队”。
    “震旦报”发表了一条关于欧洲国家会议的代表们在宣言上签字的消息，消息的标题是“苏联集团的武装部队统一在一个单一的司令部下面”。同时这家报纸指出，“谈判的大门仍然是开着的”。
    意大利
    意大利进步报纸十分重视欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议所发表的宣言。“团结报”发表了一篇文章说：“武装西德会使争执的问题无法得到解决”，“莫斯科会议结束时向西方国家发出了一个庄严的警告：一旦武装德国的巴黎协定得到批准，与会各国将采取有效的步骤来保卫自己”。
    “国家报”和“前进报”以显著地位刊载了宣言中的许多段话。“国家报”说这个宣言是“一个具有特别重大意义的文件”，它“对于西方国家可能批准巴黎协定一事表明了有力而具体的态度”，“同时它又为在西方决定延期批准巴黎协定的情况下进行国际谈判和达成和平协议打开了大门”。
    荷兰
    荷兰海牙的“真理报”刊载荷兰共产党总书记保罗·格鲁特的文章，评论欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议闭幕。
    格鲁特指出：参加莫斯科会议的八国所拟订的措施不仅是为了保卫他们自己的利益，同时也是保卫包括荷兰人民在内的西欧各国人民、使之免遭法西斯侵略的强有力的手段。
    格鲁特揭露了美国帝国主义者的阴险计划，指出西方国家政府在美国帝国主义者的压力下出卖自己人民的利益。他说，最近，特别是莫斯科会议后，不仅劳动人民，就连资产阶级政治家也开始理解到：追随华盛顿所强加的政策，就等于走向自杀的道路。
    格鲁特要求荷兰议会拒绝巴黎协定，他说，荷兰应当坚持一个主要原则：必须在提出批准问题以前先进行关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的谈判。
    比利时
    比利时报纸报道了在莫斯科举行的欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议闭幕和通过宣言的消息。“比利时自由报”着重指出：宣言吁请所有欧洲国家共同考虑建立欧洲集体安全体系的可能性并且讨论可以采取一些什么共同步骤，来奠定欧洲大陆的稳固的和平基础。
      “红旗报”发表长篇文章，评论莫斯科会议闭幕。文章的题目是：“莫斯科会议闭幕，向西方国家提出了严正警告：武装波恩将使苏联和人民民主国家不得不共同组织和加强它们的防御”。“红旗报”说，莫斯科会议的严正警告使比利时政府面临着下面的抉择：“要么是奉行武装德国复仇主义者的政策而不顾因此而给比利时带来的危险；要么是奉行建立集体安全、裁减军备和缓和国际紧张局势的政策。”　（据新华社讯）
