Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: The All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives issued instructions on the current supply of production materials on December 11th.

The instructions pointed out: This winter and next spring, agricultural production cooperatives will develop to about 600,000. Facing this new situation, the key to how the supply and marketing cooperatives can better and more effectively serve agricultural production next year lies in doing a good job of preparing for the supply of various production materials this winter. According to typical surveys, after farmers are organized, agricultural investment generally needs to be expanded, and there is a demand for exchanging old farm tools for new ones; for draft animals, there is a demand for replacing small ones with larger ones and weak ones with stronger ones; the demand for commercial fertilizers and feed will increase; and there will also be great changes in the variety, quantity, specifications, and quality requirements for small farm tools.

In order to prepare for the supply of production materials next spring, the instructions require supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to do the following work:

First, in areas that are moving towards or have basically achieved cooperativization, supply and marketing cooperatives should grasp several typical materials based on agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams, in order to analyze the new changes in farmers' demand for varieties of production materials, so as to be well-informed and avoid blind and passive work that affects production.

Second, the agricultural tools, oil cakes, chemical fertilizers, pesticide machinery, and timber building materials that are currently supplied are mostly allocated materials, and the supply targets are mainly organized farmers. Therefore, production and sales can and should be incorporated into the planning track. Supply and marketing cooperatives should widely sign combined contracts with farmers based on the production plans and supply of goods of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, and actively cooperate with the unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil through pre-sale business. Since most of these commodities do not need to be sold through the free market, there are conditions for developing direct transportation business. Supply and marketing cooperatives above the provincial level should do more organizational business through planned management and price supervision to reduce operating links and reduce costs.

Third, in order to support the unified purchase work and do a good job in the New Year's supply, small farm tools and other household daily-use tools should also be organized as much as possible and should not be ignored. However, these commodities have many styles and great regional characteristics. Supply and marketing cooperatives should actively organize sources of goods according to the principle of "taking materials locally, processing locally, and supplying locally," do a good job in inter-regional adjustments, and hold township and town material exchange meetings in a timely manner to organize direct meetings between producers and consumers and assist small handicraftsmen in solving raw material problems.

Fourth, the protection of draft animals in disaster areas is an arduous task. The phenomenon of slaughtering draft animals has not stopped in some disaster areas, which is extremely detrimental to agricultural production next year. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should actively support the feed and substitutes needed in disaster areas, and actively do a good job in organizing adjustments and fosterage work, and strive to stop the phenomenon of slaughtering draft animals. Non-disaster areas should also strengthen livestock adjustment work. The seeds and fertilizers needed for next spring should be transferred immediately to ensure that the sowing of early crops is not delayed.

### 全国供销合作总社指示各级供销合作社  及早准备供应农村生产资料

    全国供销合作总社指示各级供销合作社
    及早准备供应农村生产资料
    【新华社十三日讯】中华全国供销合作总社在十二月十一日发出了对目前生产资料供应工作的指示。
    指示指出：今冬明春农业生产合作社要发展到六十万个左右。供销合作社面对着这一新的形势，明年如何为农业生产服务得更好，更有效果，关键之一在于今冬把供应各项生产资料的准备工作做好。根据典型调查，农民组织起来以后，农业投资一般都要扩大，对农具要求以旧换新；对耕畜要求以小换大、以弱换强；对商品肥料、饲料要求增加；对小农具的品种、数量、规格、质量的要求，也有很大变化。
    为了做好明春生产资料供应的准备工作，指示要求各级供销合作社做好以下工作：
    第一，凡是正在走向或已基本上达到合作化的地区，供销合作社都应该掌握以农业生产合作社或互助组为单位的若干典型材料，借以分析农民对生产资料品种要求上的新变化，做到心中有数，以免工作盲目、被动，影响生产。
    第二，现在供应的农具、油饼、化学肥料、农药械、木料建筑器材等商品，多是一些分配性的物资，供应对象又主要是组织起来的农民，因此产销都可以而且应该纳入计划轨道。供销合作社应根据农业生产合作社和互助组的生产计划和货源情况，广泛和农民签订结合合同，并通过预售业务积极配合粮食、棉花、油料的统购工作。由于这些商品大部不需要经过自由市场出售，就有条件发展直运业务。省以上供销合作社应通过计划管理和价格监督，多做组织业务，以减少经营环节，降低成本。
    第三，为了支持统购工作，做好年节供应，小农具和其他家庭日用工具，也应尽量加以组织，不能忽视。但这些商品式样多，地方性大，供销合作社应根据“就地取材、就地加工、就地供应”的原则，积极组织货源，做好地区间的调剂，适时地召开乡、镇物资交流会，组织产消直接见面，协助小手工业者解决原料问题。
    第四，灾区的耕畜保护工作是一项艰巨的任务，有些灾区屠宰耕畜的现象仍未停止，这对明年农业生产极为不利。各地供销合作社应积极支援灾区所需要的饲料和代食品，并积极做好组织调剂和寄养工作，争取把屠宰耕畜现象停止下来。非灾区也应加强牲畜调剂工作。明春所需的种籽、肥料，应立即调运，保证不误早期作物的播种。
