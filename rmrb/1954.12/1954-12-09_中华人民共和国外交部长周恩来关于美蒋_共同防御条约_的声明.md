The United States government, disregarding the repeated opposition and warnings of the Chinese people, signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which had fled to Taiwan, on December 2, 1954. The United States government attempts to use this treaty to legitimize its act of armed occupation of China's territory Taiwan and to expand its aggression against China and prepare for new wars with Taiwan as a base. This is a serious war provocation against the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people.

Now, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, I declare: Taiwan is China's territory, and Chiang Kai-shek is a public enemy of the Chinese people. Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is entirely China's sovereignty and internal affairs, and no other country is allowed to interfere. No war threat can shake the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan, but will only increase the Chinese people's indignation. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has no right to sign any treaty with any country. The US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is fundamentally illegal and invalid. It is a treaty that sells out China's sovereignty and territory, and the Chinese people firmly oppose it. If the United States government does not withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait and continues to insist on interfering in China's internal affairs, the United States government must bear all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

The "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the United States government with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a thorough and complete aggressive war treaty. American imperialism is hostile to the Chinese people. The United States government is not reconciled to the failure of its imperialist policy in China. In June 1950, while launching the war of aggression against Korea, it armed and occupied Taiwan, sheltering and instructing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to continuously carry out harassing and destructive wars against the Chinese mainland and coastal islands. Now, the United States government sees that since the Korean War has stopped, it can no longer be used as an excuse to occupy Taiwan. Therefore, it simply fabricated this US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" to openly seize China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu.

The US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is not a defensive treaty in any sense; it is a blatant treaty of aggression. The US aggressor group and its followers claim that this treaty is defensive, but this statement cannot conceal the aggressive essence of this treaty in the slightest. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the United States government recognized this fact in the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the terms of Japan's surrender, all of which it participated in signing. The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair. The United States government also acknowledged in January 1950 that China exercised sovereignty over Taiwan and that the United States did not intend to get involved in China's internal strife. Now the United States government wants to set up defenses and establish military bases in Taiwan and Penghu, Chinese territories 5,000 miles away from the United States mainland, sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which has been spurned by 600 million Chinese people, and obstructing the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan. This is a blatant betrayal of international faith, the seizure of China's territory, the violation of China's sovereignty, and interference in China's internal affairs, and it can never be described as defense. The Chinese people's liberation of their own territory of Taiwan and the maintenance of their national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the real act of defense. Japanese militarists also described their act of invading Northeast China in 1931 as self-defense. However, no one has ever believed this statement. Everyone knows that occupying the territory of another country, infringing upon the sovereignty of another country, and interfering in the internal affairs of another country is aggression. The Chinese people, who have been tempered in the victorious struggle against Japanese militarist aggression, will never tolerate the United States invading China's Taiwan and Penghu under the name of defense.

The US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is a treaty that attempts to expand aggression and prepare for a new war. This treaty has nothing in common with maintaining peace. The US aggressor group and its followers attempt to use various arguments to cover up the war aims of this treaty, but this cannot be covered up. Everyone knows that since the United States government armed and occupied Taiwan, it has been supporting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in carrying out harassing and destructive wars against the Chinese mainland, and it has never stopped. Now, the United States government is attempting to use this treaty to legitimize the US air and naval forces' occupation of Taiwan and to obtain the right to deploy ground forces in "Taiwan, Penghu, and its vicinity" to strengthen US military bases in Taiwan. The United States government openly attempts in this treaty to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan with the threat of war, and at the same time, it has made arrangements for its aggression against China's "other territories" outside of Taiwan. There is no doubt that the signing of the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" has deepened the crisis of the United States expanding its aggression against China.

US Secretary of State Dulles openly declared in his statement on December 1 that this treaty is "another link" in the so-called security system established by the United States in the Pacific region. This shows that the US aggressor group not only wants to invade Taiwan and expand its aggression against China, but also wants to prepare for a new war. The Manila Treaty, which was signed not long ago under the planning of the United States, increased the danger of war in Southeast Asia. The US aggressor group now clearly wants to link this US-Chiang treaty with the Manila Treaty and other war treaties in Asia and the Pacific region to form an Eastern aggression system. This approach by the US aggressor group echoes its approach of planning and signing the Paris Accords in Europe, reviving German militarism, and expanding the Western aggression system. Its purpose is to deepen the division of the world, enslave the people of these regions, and step up preparations for a new world war.

From this, it can be seen that the purpose pursued by the United States government in this "Mutual Defense Treaty" is not peace, but war. In fact, the US aggressor group is currently copying the old tricks of Japanese militarism in invading China; and some people even hope that the Chinese people will forget the lessons of history and accept the status quo of the United States' occupation of Taiwan according to their will. However, the Chinese people will never forget the disaster caused by the September 18th Incident in 1931, and will never forget that the Lugouqiao Incident in 1937 was a development of the September 18th Incident. The people of Asian and Pacific countries, who still have fresh memories of the Pearl Harbor Incident in 1941, will never forget the tragic results of the policy of appeasing Japanese militarist aggression in those years. Similarly, the people of Europe will never forget that it was precisely the Munich policy of condoning German militarist aggression that led to World War II. Historical mistakes must not be repeated. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this US-Chiang war treaty that endangers China's security and Asian peace, and also resolutely oppose the Paris Accords that endanger European security and world peace.

The US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" has created new tensions in the Far East. Some people say that this treaty can lead to the easing of the Far East situation. This is a completely distorted statement. The United States government, while launching the war of aggression against Korea and stepping up interference in the Indochina War, armed and occupied Taiwan, which was originally a link in its creation of tension in the Far East. Due to the armistice in Korea and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the situation in the Far East began to ease. In order to further ease the situation in the Far East, after the Geneva Conference, we clearly proposed that the United States should withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. However, the United States government has not only not withdrawn its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, but has also instigated the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to more rampantly carry out harassing and destructive wars against the Chinese mainland. In fact, constantly creating tense situations is the consistent policy of the United States government. In recent years, it has been the armed forces of the United States that have constantly violated China's airspace and territorial waters, rather than China's armed forces invading the United States' airspace and territorial waters; it has been the United States that has sent espionage agents to the Chinese mainland to carry out subversive activities, rather than China carrying out subversive activities against the United States. In the Korean armistice, the Korean and Chinese sides faithfully implemented the armistice agreement and the repatriation of prisoners of war agreement, while the United States side violated the repatriation of prisoners of war agreement, seizing more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, incorporating them into the armies of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, and has not yet accounted for them. Regarding the restoration of peace in Indochina, the Chinese side has guaranteed the implementation of the Geneva Accords, but the United States side has not only refused to participate in the guarantee of the agreements, but has also signed the Manila Treaty and is preparing to arm and train Bao Dai's army to undermine the Geneva Accords. Now, the United States government has signed this aggressive war treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to strengthen the threat of war in the Far East and create new tensions. This proves that all responsibility for the failure to ease the tension in the Far East lies entirely with the United States.

The United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that the territorial integrity and political independence of any country must not be violated. This principle is the foundation of international peace. This treaty signed by the United States government with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, like other so-called defense treaties planned and signed by the United States, as usual, reaffirms the belief in the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. However, all these so-called defense treaties are fundamentally contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. These treaties can only lead to war and cannot promote peaceful coexistence among countries; these treaties can only mock the United Nations Charter and cannot realize the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and guarantee international peace. On the contrary, the People's Republic of China has consistently adhered to the principles of safeguarding national rights and mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, jointly proposed by China, India, and Burma, are fully in line with the purposes of the United Nations Charter. We firmly believe that if all countries in the world can abide by these five principles, strive to establish and expand peaceful areas, and avoid creating divisions, then countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, and the world's collective peace and security system can be established. The just-concluded Moscow European Conference made great efforts in this direction, and it has been widely supported by peace-loving countries and people around the world. However, the US aggressor group and its followers are doing their utmost to undermine the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and are doing everything possible to obstruct the establishment of the world's collective peace and security system, making the current international situation increasingly serious, whether in the East or the West. We believe that all peace-loving countries and people in the world have a responsibility to stop the deterioration of the international situation and intensify efforts to guarantee international peace.

For this purpose, the Chinese people are willing to solemnly declare to the world:

Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. Only by liberating Taiwan from the tyranny of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can the Chinese people complete the complete unification of their motherland and further safeguard peace in Asia and the world. All proposals for the so-called "independent country" of Taiwan, the "neutralization" of Taiwan, and the "trusteeship" of Taiwan are actually attempts to separate China's territory, infringe upon China's sovereignty, and interfere in China's internal affairs, and are absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people.

In order to ease the situation in the Far East, to eliminate the threat of war against China, and to guarantee peace in Asia and the world, the United States government must withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait. The United States has no reason to travel across the ocean to invade China's territory of Taiwan.

The Chinese people resolutely oppose war, but will never be intimidated by the threat of war. If someone insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people must resolutely fight back against the interferers and provocateurs.

The Chinese people warmly demand peace, but will never beg for peace at the cost of their own territory and sovereignty. Sacrificing territorial sovereignty can only lead to further aggression and will never achieve true peace. The Chinese people understand that only by resisting aggression can they defend peace.

    中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明
    美国政府不顾中国人民历次的反对和警告，竟在一九五四年十二月二日同逃窜在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”。美国政府企图利用这个条约来使它武装侵占中国领土台湾的行为合法化，并以台湾为基地扩大对中国的侵略和准备新的战争。这是对于中华人民共和国和中国人民的一个严重的战争挑衅。
    现在，我代表中华人民共和国政府声明：台湾是中国的领土，蒋介石是中国人民的公敌。解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，完全是中国的主权和内政，决不容许他国干涉。任何战争威胁都不能动摇中国人民解放台湾的决心，只能增强中国人民的愤慨。蒋介石卖国集团没有任何权利同任何国家签订任何条约。美蒋“共同防御条约”根本是非法的、无效的。它是一个出卖中国主权和领土的条约，中国人民坚决反对。如果美国政府不从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量，仍然坚持干涉中国内政，美国政府必须承担由此产生的一切严重后果。
    美国政府同蒋介石卖国集团签订的这个“共同防御条约”是一个彻头彻尾的侵略性的战争条约。美国帝国主义是敌视中国人民的。美国政府不甘心于它的帝国主义政策在中国的失败，一九五○年六月在发动侵略朝鲜战争的同时，便武装侵占台湾，庇护和指使蒋介石卖国集团对中国大陆和沿海岛屿不断进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争。现在，美国政府看到由于朝鲜战争已经停止，不能再用来作为侵占台湾的借口，于是索性制造了这个美蒋“共同防御条约”来公开霸占中国的领土台湾和澎湖。
    美蒋“共同防御条约”在任何意义上都不是一个防御性的条约，它是一个露骨的侵略条约。美国侵略集团和它的追随者诡称这个条约是防御性的，但是这种说法丝毫不能掩盖这个条约的侵略实质。台湾是中国的领土，美国政府在它自己参加签订的开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和日本投降条款等国际协议中承认了这个事实。中国人民解放台湾是中国的内政问题，美国政府在一九五○年一月也曾经承认中国对台湾行使主权，美国不拟卷入中国内争。现在美国政府要在远离美国本土五千英里以外的中国领土台湾和澎湖设防和建立军事基地，庇护已为六万万中国人民所唾弃了的蒋介石卖国集团，阻挠中国人民去解放自己的领土台湾，这是明目张胆地背弃国际信义、霸占中国领土、侵犯中国主权、干涉中国内政的行为，绝不能说成是防御。中国人民解放自己的领土台湾，维护自己的国家主权和领土完整，才是真正的防御行为。日本军国主义者也曾经把他们在一九三一年侵占中国东北的行为说成是自卫。但是，这种说法从来就没有人相信过。谁都知道霸占别国的领土，侵犯别国的主权，干涉别国的内政，就是侵略。在反对日本军国主义侵略的胜利斗争中久经锻炼的中国人民，决不会容忍美国在防御的名义下侵略中国的台湾和澎湖。
    美蒋“共同防御条约”是一个企图扩大侵略、准备新的战争的条约。这个条约同维护和平毫无共同之处。美国侵略集团和它的追随者企图用各种各样的论点来掩盖这个条约的战争目的，但是这是掩盖不住的。谁都知道，美国政府自从武装侵占台湾以来，一直在支持蒋介石卖国集团对中国大陆进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，从来没有停止过。现在，美国政府又企图利用这个条约使美国海空军侵占台湾的行为合法化，并取得在“台湾、澎湖及其附近”部署陆军的权利，以加强美国在台湾的军事基地。美国政府在这个条约中公然企图以战争威胁阻挠中国人民解放台湾，同时又为了它侵略台湾以外的中国“其他领土”作了安排。毫无疑问，美蒋“共同防御条约”的签订加深了美国对中国扩大侵略的危机。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在他十二月一日声明中公开宣称，这个条约是美国在太平洋地区建立的所谓安全体系中的“另一个环节”。这就说明，美国侵略集团不仅要侵占台湾，扩大对中国的侵略，而且还要准备新的战争。不久以前在美国策划下签订的马尼拉条约，增加了在东南亚的战争危险。美国侵略集团现在显然是要把这个美蒋条约同马尼拉条约和在亚洲和太平洋地区的其他战争条约联系起来，形成一个东方侵略体系。美国侵略集团的这种做法，是同它在欧洲策划签订巴黎协定、复活德国军国主义、扩大西方侵略体系的做法互相呼应的。它的目的就在于加深世界的分裂，奴役这些地区的人民，和加紧准备新的世界战争。
    由此可见，美国政府在这个“共同防御条约”中追求的目的不是和平，而是战争。事实上，美国侵略集团目前正在抄袭着日本军国主义侵略中国的故技；而有人竟希望中国人民忘记历史的教训，按照他们的意志接受美国侵占台湾的现状。但是，中国人民永远不会忘记一九三一年沈阳事变所造成的灾难，永远不会忘记一九三七年芦沟桥事变是沈阳事变的发展。对一九四一年珍珠港事变记忆犹新的亚洲和太平洋各国人民，也永远不会忘记当年姑息日本军国主义侵略的政策产生了怎样惨痛的结果。同样，欧洲人民也永远不会忘记恰恰就是纵容德国军国主义侵略的慕尼黑政策导致了第二次世界战争。历史的错误不许重演。中国人民坚决反对这个危害中国安全和亚洲和平的美蒋战争条约，也坚决反对危害欧洲安全和世界和平的巴黎协定。
    美蒋“共同防御条约”在远东造成了新的紧张局势。有人说，这个条约可以导致远东局势的和缓。这完全是一种颠倒是非的说法。美国政府在它发动侵略朝鲜战争、加紧干涉印度支那战争的同时，武装侵占了台湾，这原来就是它在远东制造紧张局势的一环。由于朝鲜的停战，印度支那和平的恢复，远东局势开始有了和缓。为了进一步和缓远东局势，在日内瓦会议之后，我们又明确地提出美国应该从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量，停止干涉中国内政。但是，美国政府不仅没有从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走它的武装力量，反而指使蒋介石卖国集团更加猖獗地对中国大陆进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争。事实上，不断制造紧张局势是美国政府的一贯政策。几年来，是美国的武装力量不断地侵犯中国的领空和领海，而不是中国的武装力量去侵犯美国的领空和领海；是美国派遣间谍分子到中国大陆上来进行颠覆活动，而不是中国对美国进行颠覆活动。在朝鲜停战中，朝中方面忠实地执行了停战协定和遣返战俘协定，而美国方面却破坏了遣返战俘协定，劫夺两万以上的朝中战俘，编入李承晚和蒋介石的军队，至今尚未交代。对于印度支那和平的恢复，中国方面保证了日内瓦协议的执行，但是美国方面不仅拒绝了参加对于协议的保证，而且还签订了马尼拉条约，并正在准备武装和训练保大的军队，来破坏日内瓦协议。现在，美国政府又同蒋介石卖国集团签订了这个侵略性的战争条约，企图在远东加强战争威胁，制造新的紧张局势。这就证明，远东紧张局势不能和缓的一切责任完全在于美国。
    联合国宪章明确规定不得侵犯任何国家的领土完整和政治独立。这项原则是国际和平的基础。美国政府同蒋介石卖国集团签订的这个条约，正如美国策划签订的其他所谓防御条约一样，照例都要重申对于联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的信念。但是所有这些所谓防御条约根本就是同联合国宪章的宗旨和原则背道而驰的。这些条约只能导致战争，决不能促进各国间的和平相处；这些条约只能是对联合国宪章的嘲弄，决不能实现联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，保障国际和平。与此相反，中华人民共和国一贯坚持保障民族权利、互相尊重国家主权和领土完整的原则。中国同印度和缅甸共同倡议的和平共处的五项原则，完全符合于联合国宪章的宗旨。我们坚信，如果世界各国能够遵守这五项原则，努力建立和扩大和平地区，避免制造分裂局面，那么，不同社会制度的国家就能够和平共处，世界的集体和平和安全体系就能够建立起来。刚刚闭幕的莫斯科欧洲会议就是朝着这个方向作了巨大的努力，它已经得到世界爱好和平的国家和人民的广泛支持。但是，美国侵略集团和它的追随者却竭力破坏和平共处的五项原则，百般阻挠世界的集体和平和安全体系的建立，使目前国际局势不论在东方或西方都日益严重。我们认为，世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民有责任制止国际局势恶化的发展，为保障国际和平加紧努力。
    为此目的，中国人民愿意向全世界郑重宣告：
    台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。只有把台湾从蒋介石卖国集团的暴政下解放出来，中国人民才能完成自己祖国的完全统一，才能进一步维护亚洲和世界的和平。一切关于所谓台湾
  “独立国”、台湾“中立化”和“托管”台湾的主张实际上都是割裂中国领土，侵犯中国主权和干涉中国内政，都是中国人民绝对不能同意的。
    为了和缓远东局势，为了消除对中国的战争威胁和保障亚洲和世界的和平，美国政府必须从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量。美国没有任何理由远涉重洋来侵占中国的领土台湾。
    中国人民坚决地反对战争，但是决不会被战争威胁吓倒。如果有人硬要把战争强加在中国人民头上，中国人民一定要对干涉者和挑衅者给以坚决的回击。
    中国人民热烈地要求和平，但是决不会拿自己的领土和主权作代价乞求和平。牺牲领土主权，只能导致进一步的侵略，决不会得到真正的和平。中国人民懂得，只有反抗侵略，才能保卫和平。
                  一九五四年十二月八日
