    The Rich Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region

    While the banks of the Yellow River are currently covered in ice and snow, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southern China is a vibrant green. Farmers of all ethnic groups have just finished harvesting the late rice crop and are now busily engaged in winter planting. Miao and Dong farmers in the Jiuwan Mountains are busy selecting tree seeds to prepare for seedling cultivation; in the dense sugarcane fields, Zhuang and Han farmers are harvesting sugarcane. The third crop of corn, which was test-planted this year in the Youjiang River basin, has already matured; farmers in the mountainous areas of Daxin, Zhendou, and Ningming counties in the southwest of the Autonomous Region are transplanting winter rice (paddy rice).
    The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region covers a total area of more than 132,000 square kilometers. It is the most populous ethnic autonomous region in China, with a total population of more than 8.8 million, including Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Dong, Han, and more than ten other ethnic groups. The Zhuang people account for two-thirds of the region's total population. The climate here is warm, with abundant rainfall and no ice or snow throughout the year, making it ideal for crop growth. People of all ethnic groups not only cultivate two seasons of paddy rice on the banks of the Yu River, Liu River, and Zuo River, but also reclaim terraced fields in the towering mountains.
    The People's Government leads farmers of all ethnic groups in building water conservancy projects to turn dry land into paddy fields. In recent years, the water conservancy projects built can irrigate more than 5 million mu of land. Among them, the Tanglai Reservoir in Binyang, the Huangsang River in Tianyang, and the Lujiang River in Long'an irrigate an area of 10,000 to 30,000 mu. Farmers of all ethnic groups in mountainous and hilly areas have built more than 110,000 various small-scale water conservancy projects in recent years, utilizing the water sources of mountain valleys and small rivers.
    This spring, the entire region successively completed land reform. Farmers of all ethnic groups actively participated in the agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation. In the past two years, the cultivated land area in the entire region has been expanded by more than 800,000 mu, 60% of the paddy fields have implemented close planting with small seedlings, and the amount of fertilizer applied has generally increased. This year, the total output of grain such as rice and corn in the entire region increased by 16% compared with last year, and by more than 1 billion jin compared with when the Autonomous Region was established in 1952. Since last year, there has been a surplus of grain for export, and the historically persistent phenomenon of grain shortage has been changed.
    The vast mountainous and hilly areas of Guangxi are excellent forest farms and pastures. The border area of the Autonomous Region, bordering Yunnan and Guizhou, has hundreds of miles of primeval forests. Banana, grapefruit, longan, and other fruit trees are found everywhere, and tropical crops such as pineapple, lemon, and coffee are also produced here. Farmers of all ethnic groups have utilized the favorable conditions of evergreen mountain pastures and abundant feed to raise more than 600,000 more cattle and pigs this year than in 1952. These mountainous areas produce more than 300 kinds of local and special products. Due to the development of transportation industries such as railways, highways, and shipping, coupled with the successive bumper harvests of various local and special products, the materials provided by people of all ethnic groups to support national economic construction have increased year by year. The timber of the Autonomous Region has supported the Huai River project, the Kailuan Coal Mine, and the basic construction in North China and Northwest China; the main local and special products such as tung oil, tea oil, star anise, cane sugar, and medicinal materials are sold at home and abroad.
    The industrial and mining enterprises of the Autonomous Region have also developed greatly. The entire region now has more than 100 industrial and mining enterprises such as electricity, fuel, and textiles. The mountainous areas of Guangxi also contain dozens of minerals such as iron, coal, and tin. With the development of the country's socialist construction, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will contribute even greater strength to the country's economic construction.

    富饶的桂西僮族自治区
    新华社记者　陈蓬生
    现在，黄河两岸正是冰天雪地的时候，但在祖国南部的广西省桂西僮族自治区却到处是一片碧绿。各族农民刚收完晚稻，又紧张地进行冬种。九万大山区的苗、侗族农民正忙着选树种准备育苗；在茂密的甘蔗地里，僮、汉族农民在收割甘蔗。右江流域一带今年试种的第三造玉米已经结实；自治区西南部的大新、镇都、宁明等县山区农民正进行冬禾（水稻）插秧。
    桂西僮族自治区全区面积共十三万二千多平方公里，是我国人口最多的一个民族自治区，全区人口八百八十多万，包括僮、瑶、苗、侗、汉等十多个民族。僮族占全区总人口的三分之二。这里气候温暖，雨量充沛，终年不见冰雪，最适宜于农作物生长。各族人民不但在郁江、柳江和左江两岸耕种两季水稻田，并在丛山峻岭里开辟了梯田。
    人民政府领导各族农民兴修水利，变旱地为水田。几年来兴修的水利工程，可灌溉五百多万亩田地。其中宾阳塘来水库、田阳磺桑江、隆安渌水江等水利工程，灌溉面积达一万到三万多亩。山区和丘陵地带的各族农民，利用山谷和小河的水源，几年来兴修的各种小型水利工程有十一万多处。
    今年春天，全区先后完成了土地改革。各族农民积极参加以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动。两年来，全区扩大耕地面积八十多万亩，有百分之六十的稻田实行了小株密植，普遍增加了施肥量。今年全区稻谷、玉米等粮食产量比去年增产百分之十六，比一九五二年自治区成立时增产十多亿斤。从去年开始就有余粮外调，历史上一向缺粮的现象已经改变。
    桂西的广大山区和丘陵地带是良好的林场和牧场。自治区和云南、贵州接壤的边境，有方圆数百里的原始森林。香蕉、柚子、桂圆等水果树到处可见，这里还出产菠萝、柠檬、咖啡等热带作物。各族农民利用山区牧草常青、饲料丰富的有利条件，今年饲养的牛和猪比一九五二年增加六十多万头。这些山区出产的土产特产有三百多种。由于铁路、公路和航运等交通运输事业的发展，加上各种土产特产连年丰收，各族人民支援国家经济建设的物资逐年增多。自治区的木材，曾支援过治淮工地、开滦煤矿和华北、西北等地的基本建设；主要土产特产桐油、茶油、八角、蔗糖和药材等行销国内外。
    自治区的工矿企业也有很大发展。全区现有电力、燃料、纺织等工矿企业一百多个。桂西山区还蕴藏着铁、煤、锡等几十种矿产。随着国家社会主义建设事业的发展，桂西僮族自治区将贡献出更大的力量来进行祖国经济建设。
