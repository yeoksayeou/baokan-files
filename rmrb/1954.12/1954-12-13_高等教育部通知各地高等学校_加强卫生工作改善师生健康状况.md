The Ministry of Higher Education of the People's Republic of China recently issued a "Notice on Further Improving the Health of Teachers and Students in Universities and Strengthening School Hygiene Work." The notice pointed out: Since the government issued the "Decision on Improving the Health of Students at All Levels of Schools" in 1951, especially since Chairman Mao called on the nation's youth to be "good in health, good in study, and good in work," universities across the country have worked hard to improve students' learning and living conditions, strengthened physical exercise, and paid attention to the health of teachers. As a result, the health of teachers and students has gradually improved. However, generally speaking, the health of teachers and students is still not good enough, and the situation in individual schools is relatively serious, which has affected the completion of the teaching tasks of some teachers and the learning tasks of some students to a certain extent. To this end, universities in various regions must continue to strengthen leadership over physical education, carry out various sports activities, and rationally adjust the work and rest schedules of teachers and students; vigorously improve school hygiene work and gradually improve school medical equipment conditions; strengthen the planning of teaching work in departments and teaching and research groups, and actively improve teaching methods, in order to further overcome the phenomenon of some teachers being too busy and students studying too intensely; appropriately improve the diet and nutrition of teachers and students; strictly implement physical examination procedures at the time of enrollment to prevent students from entering school with illnesses.

    高等教育部通知各地高等学校
    加强卫生工作改善师生健康状况
    中华人民共和国高等教育部，最近发出“关于进一步改善高等学校师生健康状况及加强学校卫生工作”的通知。通知指出：自一九五一年政府发出“关于改善各级学校学生健康状况的决定”，特别自毛主席号召全国青年“身体好、学习好、工作好”以后，全国高等学校努力改善了学生的学习和生活条件，加强了体育锻炼，注意了教师的健康，因而师生健康状况渐有好转。但一般说来，师生健康状况还不够好，个别学校还比较严重，因而使部分教师的教学任务和部分学生的学习任务的完成受到了一定的影响。为此，各地高等学校必须继续加强对体育工作的领导，开展各种体育活动，合理地调整师生作息时间；大力改进学校卫生工作和逐步改善学校医疗设备条件；加强系和教研组教学工作的计划性，积极改进教学方法，以求进一步克服部分教师过忙和学生学习过于紧张的现象；适当地改善师生的伙食营养；入学时严格执行身体复查手续，以防止学生带病入学的现象。
