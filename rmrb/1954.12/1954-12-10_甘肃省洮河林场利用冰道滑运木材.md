    Gansu Province’s Taohe River Forest Farm utilizes ice paths to transport timber.
    Recently, workers at the Taohe River Forest Farm in Gansu Province have implemented a new method of using ice paths to transport timber. On the slopes of the Ma Zhanna, Qibusi, and Qicaosi forest areas, one can now see ice slides with a total length of twelve li. The felled huge timber slides down the ice paths to the banks of the Taohe River, and the workers then transport these timbers from the Taohe River to Lanzhou.
    The ice slide was created by workers in the Shuangcha forest area. Before the ground froze, the workers first dug grooves about one meter wide on the slopes of the logging area. As soon as the freezing began, water was poured into the grooves, and a smooth slide quickly formed. This is much more efficient than using oxen to drag timber downhill in the past. The Ma Zhanna forest area transports 65 cubic meters of timber every day, which can save 80 man-days and 260 animal power. It is estimated that the forest farm's timber collection plan for this winter can be completed ahead of schedule, and the timber collection costs for the fourth quarter can be reduced by more than 160 million yuan.

    甘肃省洮河林场利用冰道滑运木材
    甘肃省洮河林场职工最近实行了一种利用冰道滑运木材的新方法。在马占那、七布寺、七曹寺等林区的山坡上，现在可以看到总长十二里的冰滑道，砍伐下来的巨大木材顺着冰道滑到洮河岸上，工人们就把这些木材从洮河流送到兰州去。
    冰滑道是双岔林区职工创造的。在地冻之前，职工们先在采伐地的山坡上挖好宽一公尺左右的沟槽，冻结一开始就在沟槽内浇水，一条光滑的滑道就很快地形成了。这比过去用牛往下拖运木材，效率大大提高。马占那林区每天滑运六十五立方公尺的木材，就可节省八十个人工和两百六十个畜力。估计今年冬季全林场的集运木材计划可以提前完成，第四季度的集材费用并可节省一亿六千多万元。（新华社）
