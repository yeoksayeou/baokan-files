    Relay Stations Established on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway
    Since the Qinghai-Tibet Highway cut through the desolate grasslands from Golmud in Qinghai to Heihe in Tibet, convoys of trucks loaded with supplies have been rushing day and night. The once desolate grassland has begun to gradually change its face. Along the highway near the Tanggula Mountains and the Tongtian River, construction workers have established nearly ten relay stations of varying sizes. The staff at the relay stations use white flour, canned food brought from the interior, and wild animal meat they hunt themselves to prepare delicious meals, warmly entertaining the passing personnel. They are diligently engaged in construction on the grassland. In places where there is no wood, they carry stone slabs and rocks from miles away to build tall "stone slab houses." In some places where even stone slabs are unavailable, they utilize the terrain to build spacious cave dwellings to accommodate passing personnel. They use cow dung, coal, and various fuels in these dwellings to set up stoves for passing personnel to warm themselves by; in places with hot springs, they have also built "grassland bathhouses" for passing personnel to bathe in. Due to their diligence and warm hospitality, passing personnel call these relay stations comfortable "grassland homes."
    A reporter visited one of the relay stations. The responsible comrade of the relay station, Li Zhenguo, said: "As the highway progresses forward, the desolate grassland has begun to change its appearance. In the future, with the ever-growing development of the motherland's economic construction, these relay stations may gradually become new cities on the grassland."

    青藏公路线上设立驿站
    从青海格尔穆到西藏黑河的荒凉草原上，自从青藏公路从这里穿过以后，满载着物资的汽车队，不分昼夜地奔驰着。过去渺无人烟的草原，已开始逐渐改变着面貌。在唐古喇山下、在通天河畔的公路线上，筑路人员已经设立了大小近十个驿站。驿站里的工作人员们，把内地带来的白面、罐头和自己打的野兽肉，做成美味的餐食，热情地招待着过往的人员。他们勤劳地在草原上进行建设。在没有木料的地方，从几里路以外抬来石板、石块修起了高大的“石板屋”，有些地方连石板也找不到，就利用地形筑起宽阔的窑洞，供过往人员住宿。他们用牛粪、煤和各种燃料在这些住所里给过往人员设置烤火的火炉；在有温泉的地方，他们还修起了
  “草原浴池”给过往人员洗澡。由于他们的勤劳和热情的招待，过往人员都把这些驿站称为舒适的“草原之家”。
    记者访问了一个驿站，驿站负责同志李振国说：“随着公路的向前进展，荒凉的草原已经开始变样了，今后，随着祖国经济建设的日益发展，这些驿站也许将会逐渐变成草原上的新城市”。
