Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch, New York: According to the request of the American delegation, the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the 6th to discuss the issue of including the so-called "accusation of detaining and imprisoning UN military personnel in violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement" on the agenda of the General Assembly. Before the United States put forward this "accusation," American newspapers and radios stirred up a hostile and clamorous movement regarding the verdict of the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China on American spies and saboteurs who sneaked into the airspace of the People's Republic of China and were captured. On the 5th, UN personnel and the press learned that the representatives of the US-British bloc countries, which held a majority in the General Committee, secretly agreed at a meeting to submit this issue to the United Nations, and even allocated their respective roles in making recommendations to the General Committee.

American representative Lodge, in describing the "accusation," repeated the arguments in the American memorandum, as if the American planes were shot down not in the airspace of the People's Republic of China but in the airspace of Korea, and these detained spies (Lodge called them UN military personnel) should be repatriated as prisoners of war.

British representative Nutting supported the American "accusation" and suggested discussing this "accusation" directly at the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly starting from the 8th, even though according to the rules of procedure, any issue can only be discussed seven days after it has been included in the agenda.

Subsequently, Soviet representative Malik spoke, saying that there was no basis for including this issue on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. Malik said that the statement in the American memorandum regarding the circumstances of the judicial organs of the People's Republic of China detaining and sentencing eleven American soldiers captured for engaging in espionage and sabotage activities against the government and people of the People's Republic of China was not in accordance with the actual situation. According to the investigation by the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China, thirteen American citizens were captured by the Chinese authorities when they illegally sneaked into the territory of the People's Republic of China with sinister intentions.

Two civilians, Downey and Fecteau, were staff members of the US Central Intelligence Agency. They were captured after they sneaked into Jilin Province, People's Republic of China, on an American plane on November 29, 1952.

As for Colonel Arnold, Major Baughman, and the other nine people, according to a report by the Xinhua News Agency, they were captured when they sneaked into Liaoning Province, People's Republic of China, on an American plane on January 12, 1953, with sinister intentions.

According to recognized international law, and according to the laws of various countries, judicial issues concerning the investigation and handling of criminals engaged in espionage activities fall entirely within the scope of the domestic jurisdiction of each country.

The Soviet representative drew the attention of the representatives of the General Committee to the fact that the fact that American planes carrying eleven American soldiers sneaked into the airspace of the People's Republic of China with sinister intentions has been confirmed by objective evidence submitted to the court and the confessions of Colonel Arnold and Major Baughman during the trial process.

Malik then emphasized that the attempt by the American delegation and the delegations supporting it to force the General Assembly to discuss the sentencing of American spies and saboteurs by China is merely a habitual trick by the United States to use the United Nations to achieve its diplomatic goals. He said that raising this issue is intended to use it to intensify the Cold War. Raising this issue is intended to divert world public opinion in order to conceal a series of aggressive acts committed by the United States against the People's Republic of China.

The systematic air raids on the Chinese mainland, which occurred in the past during the Korean War and are still occurring now that the Korean Armistice Agreement signed by the warring parties has come into effect, the frequent bombings and strafings of cities and villages of the People's Republic of China, the piratical seizure of Chinese and other countries' ships on the high seas by Chiang Kai-shek's warships with the close assistance and supervision of the American armed forces, the continuous intrusion of American aircraft into Chinese airspace individually and in groups, the direct participation of the American Air Force in unprovoked attacks on Chinese aircraft, and finally, the provocative demonstrations by the American naval fleet near the Chinese coast - all these are manifestations of the American policy of aggression against the Chinese people.

It is these matters that the United Nations should seriously concern itself with and discuss in order to take measures to prevent this region of the Far East from becoming a source of war danger that threatens peace.

Malik pointed out that using the United Nations as a diplomatic tool of a member state of the United Nations, initially using it to conceal aggression against the Korean people, and now using it to conceal espionage and sabotage activities against the Chinese people and their government, seriously damages the credibility and prestige of the United Nations.

Malik concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation opposes including the issue raised by the American delegation on the agenda and will vote against this proposal.

Czechoslovak representative Nosek also opposed including this issue on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. He said that the purpose of the American proposal is to strengthen the hostile propaganda against the People's Republic of China that it had previously widely conducted through newspapers, radio, and television. Nosek emphasized that the assertion that the convicted American spies were shot down over Korean airspace (on which all accusations are based) is a complete lie. He pointed out that even American newspapers had admitted that the plane was shot down north of the Yalu River, and he cited a passage from the "Christian Science Monitor" regarding this matter as proof.

American representative Lodge spoke a second time, attempting to deny that the sentenced people were spies and saboteurs.

To this end, Soviet representative Malik read excerpts from the confessions of the American spies themselves, proving that the American representative's denial was unfounded.

Burmese representative Barrington said that the United Nations General Assembly should not discuss this issue because the armistice agreement stipulates a certain procedure for handling violations of the armistice agreement and also stipulates the establishment of a special body - the Military Armistice Commission. Therefore, the Burmese delegation will abstain from voting. Syrian representative Rafik Asha also made a similar statement.

The representatives of Australia, Iceland, Thailand, and France advocated including the American "accusation" on the agenda of the General Assembly. French representative Hoppenot openly said that this issue should be discussed in the General Assembly in order to "mobilize public opinion." Hoppenot's statement was tantamount to admitting that the real purpose of the American "accusation" was to incite hostile propaganda against the People's Republic of China.

During the vote, ten votes were in favor of including the American "accusation" on the agenda, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia voted against it, and the representatives of Burma and Syria abstained.

In this way, the US-British bloc of countries forcibly passed the decision to discuss this issue directly in the plenary session of the United Nations General Assembly by such a majority.

    美国强使所谓“控诉”我国判决美国间谍案列入联大议程
    马立克揭穿美国借此掩藏侵略中国的行为
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：根据美国代表团的要求，联合国大会总务委员会在六日举行会议，讨论把所谓“控诉违反朝鲜停战协定扣留和囚禁联合国军事人员”的项目列入大会议程的问题。在美国提出这个“控诉案”之前，美国报纸和无线电就对于中华人民共和国最高人民法院军事审判庭对偷入中华人民共和国领空而被捕获的美国间谍和破坏分子的判决，煽动起了一个敌视叫嚣的运动。五日，联合国人士和新闻界便知道，在总务委员会占多数的美英集团国家的代表在秘密会议上协议把这一问题提交联合国，甚至在向总务委员会提出建议方面还分配了各自担当的角色。
    美国代表洛奇在叙述“控诉案”的时候，重复了美国备忘录中的论调，说得好像美国飞机不是在中华人民共和国领空而是在朝鲜领空被击落的，这些被扣留的间谍（洛奇把他们叫做是联合国军人员）应该当作战俘遣送回去。
    英国代表纳丁支持美国的“控诉案”，并建议从八日起直接在联合国大会全体会议上讨论这个“控诉案”。虽然按照议事规则，任何一个问题只能在它被列入议程七天后才开始讨论。
    接着，苏联代表马立克发言，他说，把这个问题列入联合国大会议程是没有任何根据的。马立克说，美国备忘录关于中华人民共和国司法机关拘留和判处所捕获的对中华人民共和国政府及中国人民进行间谍活动和破坏活动的十一名美国军人的情况的说法，是不符合实际情况的。据中华人民共和国最高人民法院军事审判庭查明，十三名美国公民是当他们非法地抱着罪恶目的潜入中华人民共和国国境的时候，被中国当局捕获的。
    两名文职人员唐奈和费克图是美国中央情报局工作人员，他们在一九五二年十一月二十九日乘美国飞机潜入中华人民共和国吉林省后被捕获。
    至于阿诺德上校、包莫少校和其他九人，据新华通讯社报道，他们是在一九五三年一月十二日乘美国飞机抱着罪恶目的潜入中华人民共和国辽宁省的时候被捕获的。
    根据公认的国际法，根据各国的法律，对查获从事间谍活动的罪犯的司法问题是完全属于各国内政权限范围之内的。
    苏联代表提请总务委员会的代表们注意，美国飞机载着十一个美国军人，抱着罪恶的目的偷入中华人民共和国领空的事实，已为提交法院的客观证据和阿诺德上校、包莫少校在审讯过程中的口供所证实。
    马立克接着着重说，美国代表团和支持它的代表团要强迫大会讨论美国间谍和破坏分子被中国判刑的问题，这种企图只是美国要利用联合国来达到它的外交目的的惯常的伎俩。他说，提出这个问题是要利用它来加紧冷战。提出这一问题是要转移世界舆论的注意，以便掩藏美国对中华人民共和国所进行的一连串侵略行为。
    有计划地对中国大陆进行空袭的事情，在过去朝鲜战争进行的时候和交战双方所签订的朝鲜停战协定已经生效的现在都在不断地发生，轰炸和扫射中华人民共和国的城市和乡村的事情经常出现，蒋介石军舰在美国武装力量紧密的协助和监督之下在公海上海盗式地劫夺中国和其他国家的船只，美国飞机不断个别地和成批地侵入中国领空，美国空军直接参加了对中国飞机的无端袭击，最后，美国海军舰队在中国海岸附近进行挑衅性的示威——这一切都是美国对中国人民实行这种侵略政策的表现。
    正是这些事情，联合国应当认真过问，加以讨论，以便采取措施，使远东这个地区不至成为威胁和平的战争危险的策源地。
    马立克指出，有人利用联合国作为联合国一个会员国的外交工具，起初利用它来掩饰对朝鲜人民的侵略，现在又利用它来掩饰对中国人民及其政府所进行的间谍破坏活动，这种行径严重地损害联合国的威信和威望。
    马立克最后说，苏联代表团反对把美国代表团提出的问题列入议程，并且将投票反对这个建议。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表诺西克也反对把这个问题列入联合国大会议程。他说，美国的建议的目的在于加强它早先就通过报纸、无线电和电视广泛地进行的对中华人民共和国的敌意宣传。诺西克着重说：有些人硬说被判罪的美国间谍是在朝鲜领空上被击落的（一切控诉都以这一点为根据），这种论调完全是谎话。他指出，甚至美国的报纸也曾经承认这架飞机是在鸭绿江以北的地方被击落的，他并且援引了“基督教科学箴言报”一段关于这方面的消息作为证明。
    美国代表洛奇第二次发言，企图否认被判刑的人是间谍和破坏分子。
    为此，苏联代表马立克念了美国间谍本人的供词的几段，证明了美国代表的这种否认是毫无根据的。
    缅甸代表巴林顿说，联合国大会不应该讨论这个问题，因为，停战协定规定有处理违反停战协定问题的一定程序，而且还规定设有一个特别机构——军事停战委员会。因此，缅甸代表团将在表决时弃权。叙利亚代表拉斐卡·阿沙也作了类似的发言。
    澳大利亚、冰岛、泰国和法国的代表主张把美国的“控诉案”列入大会议程。法国代表奥培诺公然说，这个问题正应当在大会上讨论，以便“动员舆论”。奥培诺这就无异承认了美国的“控诉案”的真正目的是煽动对中华人民共和国的敌意宣传。
    在表决时，十票赞成把美国“控诉案”列入议程，苏联和捷克斯洛伐克投反对票，缅甸和叙利亚的代表弃权。
    美英集团的国家就以这样的多数强行通过了由联合国大会全体会议直接讨论这个问题的决定。
