Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 1st: The representative of the People's Republic of China, Zhang Wentian, who attended the European countries' conference on guaranteeing European peace and security as an observer, addressed the conference on November 29th. The full text is as follows:

    Respected Comrades:
    I, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, extend a warm welcome to the Soviet Government for initiating this conference. We believe that although the United States, Britain, France, and other Western European countries have not participated in this conference, it will undoubtedly have a very important impact on European collective security and the cause of world peace. Therefore, I fully support the proposal of Comrade Molotov, the head of the Soviet delegation, and agree that the conference should begin its work immediately with the attendance of the representatives of the existing countries.

    我国代表张闻天在欧洲会议上致词
   【新华社莫斯科一日电】以观察员身份出席欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议的中华人民共和国代表张闻天在十一月二十九日会议上致词，全文如下： 尊敬的同志们：
    我代表中华人民共和国政府对苏联政府发起召开这次会议表示热烈欢迎。我们认为：这次会议虽然没有美、英、法和其他西欧国家的参加，但是它对欧洲集体安全和世界和平事业无疑会有极重大的作用。因此，我完全支持苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫同志的建议，同意会议在现有各国代表的出席下立即开始它的工作。
