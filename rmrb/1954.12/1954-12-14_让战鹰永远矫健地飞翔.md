    On the Zhejiang front, no matter which airfield you enter, the first thing you see is a long line of aircraft on the tarmac, with many ground crew members in blue overalls working intensely. Some are climbing on the planes, others are lying under the belly of the aircraft, braving the cold wind and even working under the stars and moon to carefully inspect and repair the aircraft, using their tireless labor day and night to ensure flight safety and combat victories.

    "No faults overnight, no faults in the sky." This is the common slogan of every ground crew member, and they realize it through selfless labor. In order to troubleshoot, some ground crew members often work for days and nights without rest. Before our People's Air Force fiercely bombed the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the coastal islands such as Dachen Island in early November, the ground crew members of a certain bomber unit specially organized assault teams to overhaul the aircraft. They took care of the various parts of the aircraft as if they were caring for their own babies, wiping them clean. Some ground crew members worked continuously for three days and three nights, their eyes were red, and they were too sleepy to hold on; however, they rubbed their eyes, jumped up and down, and insisted on continuing. Yang Shuhua, who was awarded the Third Class Merit for his work, said: "If the fault is not eliminated, I can't sleep when I come back; sometimes even if I fall asleep, I am still repairing the plane in my dream."

    The aircraft service team, which was awarded the Collective Third Class Merit for their work, once repaired an aircraft in a rainstorm. The raindrops hit them so hard that they could not open their eyes, their clothes were wet, and everyone was so cold that their lips turned white and they shivered. However, in order to maintain the aircraft, everyone insisted on carrying out repairs in the wind and rain. In the evening, the rain stopped, and they were still working in the water, and finally installed the last screw, ensuring the flight the next day.

    Once, an aircraft service team was inspecting an aircraft that had returned from a flight. When mechanic Zhang Chuande checked the gasoline system of the engine, he found that one of the fuel tanks had a crack; they decided to rush to repair it immediately. They worked from 2:00 a.m. to evening, and they fought against fatigue and continued to work under the lights all night until 4:00 a.m. the next morning before all the repairs were completed. Although everyone was tired, they felt unspeakably happy.

    In a certain fighter unit, after aircraft No. XX once returned from a combat mission, the ground crew found that the nose landing gear was not operating normally during the inspection and had to be repaired immediately. Mechanic Zheng Keying decided to have mechanic Zhu Zengqi stay to guard the aircraft, and he personally removed the landing gear and sent it to the repair shop overnight. It was already past 11:00 p.m., and the landing gear had not been repaired. In order to enable this aircraft to participate in the battle the next day, Zheng Keying continued to repair it tensely, braving the cold of early winter. When he brought the repaired landing gear back to the aircraft, Zhu Zengqi, who had been waiting by the aircraft, dispelled his fatigue and immediately climbed onto the cold cement floor with Zheng Keying to quickly install the landing gear. At this time, their clothes were all wet with sweat and dew. When they returned to the dormitory, it was already 2:00 a.m. the next morning, and the other ground crew members had already gotten up; so, they ran back to the airport and started the next day's work.

    In order to ensure flight safety and combat victories, the ground crew members worked tirelessly day and night. Every victory won by the aircraft they maintain aroused infinite joy and pride in their hearts. Now, they are guarding their "comrades" beside them in the cold winter wind and snow, carefully maintaining every aircraft, and working selflessly to welcome new victories. (Xinhua News Agency)

    让战鹰永远矫健地飞翔

    在浙江前线，你不论走进那一个飞机场，首先就看到停机坪上一长列的飞机旁边有许多穿着蓝色工作服的地勤人员们正在紧张地工作着。他们有的爬在飞机上，有的躺在机腹下面，冒着寒风以至披星戴月地仔细地检查、修理着飞机，夜以继日地用自己辛勤的劳动，保证着飞行的安全和战斗的胜利。
    “故障不过夜，故障不上天。”这是每一个地勤人员的共同口号、并以忘我的劳动来实现了它。为了排除故障，有的地勤人员常常一连工作几天几夜不休息。十一月初，在我人民空军猛烈轰炸大陈岛等沿海岛上蒋贼军以前，某轰炸部队的地勤人员们专门组织了突击组来检修飞机，他们像母亲关心自己的婴儿一样，把飞机上的各种机件都擦洗得干干净净。有的地勤人员连续工作了三天三夜，眼睛熬红了，瞌睡得难于支持了；但是，他们揉揉眼、跳跳高，还是坚持干下去。在工作中荣立三等功的杨树华说：“如果不把故障排除，回来也睡不着；有时虽然睡着了，但仍在梦中检修飞机。”
    在工作中荣立集体三等功的某飞机勤务组，有一次在暴风雨中检修飞机，雨点打得他们睁不开眼，衣服淋湿了，大家冻得嘴唇发白，浑身发抖。但是，为了维护好飞机，大家仍旧在风雨中坚持进行检修。晚上，雨停了，他们还站在水里工作，终于把最后的一个螺丝钉也安装好了，保证了第二天的飞行。
    有一次，某飞机勤务组在检查一架飞行回来的飞机。机械员张传德检查发动机部分的汽油系统时，发现一个油箱已经有了裂纹；他们决定立刻赶修。从上午两点修到晚上，他们又一面和疲倦作斗争，一面在灯光下继续工作了一个通宵，直到第二天早晨四点钟才全部修好了。大家虽然都满面倦容，但心里却有着说不出的高兴。
    在某歼击机部队里，某号飞机有一次完成战斗任务回来以后，地勤人员们在检查时发现前起落架操纵不正常，必须立刻修理。机械师郑克英决定由机械员朱曾琪留下看守飞机，自己亲自卸下起落架，连夜送到修理厂去修理。已经到了晚上十一点多钟，起落架还没有修好。为了使这架飞机能够参加第二天的战斗，郑克英冒着初冬的寒冷，继续紧张地修理着。当他把修好了的这个起落架带回飞机那里时，一直守候在飞机旁边的朱曾琪驱散了疲倦，立即和郑克英爬在冰冷的水泥地上，迅速把起落架安装好了。这时，他们的衣服却被汗水和露水全部湿透了。当他们刚回到宿舍时，已经是第二天清晨二点钟，其他的地勤人员已经起床了；于是，他们又跑回机场，开始了第二天的工作。
    为了保证飞行的安全和战斗的胜利，地勤人员们就这样夜以继日的辛勤的工作着。他们对自己维护的飞机所取得的每一次胜利，在心灵深处都引起了无限的喜悦和自豪。现在，他们正在寒冬风雪中更加艰苦的终日守卫在他们的“战友”的身边，细心地维护着每一架飞机，为迎接新的胜利而忘我的工作着。　（新华社）
