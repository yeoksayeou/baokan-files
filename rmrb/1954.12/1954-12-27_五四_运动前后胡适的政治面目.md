    Hu Shi's Political Face Before and After the May Fourth Movement
    Zeng Wenjing
    In modern Chinese history, there appeared such a grand deception: around the time of the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shi advocated vernacular Chinese and made many boasts, confusing many people and leading them to believe that Hu Shi was a leading figure of the May Fourth Movement.
    This is truly the height of absurdity! Hu Shi was hardly such a character! Based on factual analysis, he was originally a comprador scholar and politician trained by American imperialism.
    Hu Shi was sent to study in the United States by American imperialists using the "returned" Boxer Indemnity funds. Shortly after arriving in the United States, he "became very fond of that country and its people," feeling that "in this place, it seems there is nothing that human intelligence cannot accomplish" ("My Faith"). He worshiped everything about the United States with the utmost reverence. His views on domestic politics also began to be deeply influenced by the American policy towards China.
    In May 1911, the Four-Power Banking Consortium signed a loan agreement with the Qing government, and the United States directly controlled the rights to the Guangdong-Hankou and Yichang-Kuizhou railways, triggering the "Railway Protection Movement" among merchants and civilians in Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guangdong, which erupted into the Xinhai Revolution.
    The American government adopted an opposing attitude towards the Xinhai Revolution, refusing to recognize the Nanjing Provisional Government at the time, which was a sign of its opposition.
    Hu Shi also opposed the Xinhai Revolution at that time. Whenever Chinese students in the United States discussed this event, he would always say in English: "I am in favor of gradualism, not revolution."
    After the Xinhai Revolution, Hu Shi went to Columbia University in the United States to study under Dewey. From then on, his mind was filled with the poison of American reactionary philosophy—Pragmatism.
    In 1915, Japanese imperialism presented the "Twenty-One Demands" to Yuan Shikai, demanding acceptance in exchange for recognizing his imperial ambitions. The United States agreed with Japan's actions. The book "The Four-Power Banking Consortium" reveals this secret: "The purpose of the U.S. State Department was to grant Japan the benefits it desired." After Yuan Shikai signed these traitorous conditions on May 9th, the U.S. State Department also declared in notes with identical content to both China and Japan: "The United States frankly recognizes that territorial contiguity creates a special relationship between Japan and these areas (referring to Shandong, South Manchuria, and East Mongolia)."
    Hu Shi also supported Yuan Shikai's traitorous behavior. Before Yuan Shikai signed, seeing that "Chinese students in the United States all advocated declaring war on Japan immediately," he "wrote an open letter to the Chinese Students' Monthly, advising moderation and composure," disregarding even being "condemned as a traitor" ("My Faith"). The day after Yuan Shikai signed, he wrote in his notebook: "Our country's handling of this negotiation with Japan can be described as knowing ourselves and knowing our enemy, being both prudent and unyielding, able to be flexible and firm. This is unprecedented in the history of diplomacy" ("Zanghui Studio Notes," Volume 9).
    After Yuan Shikai's death, he greatly lamented, saying: "At that time (after the start of the Xinhai Revolution), Yuan held great power internally and had the support of the powers externally. If he could have made good use of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lead our country to a state of order, then living in glory and dying in sorrow would have been what one would expect" ("Zanghui Studio Notes," Volume 15).
    In the United States, Hu Shi also had connections with American reactionary politics. He visited former U.S. President Taft, calling him "a good man" ("Zanghui Studio Notes," Volume 9), and participated in American election activities, "advocating for Wilson's re-election" ("Zanghui Studio Notes," Volume 15). On the eve of his return to China, he said goodbye to the American reactionary philosopher Dewey. He himself talked about the scene at that time: "The professor (referring to Dewey) said that his concern for international political issues outweighed everything else. He instructed me that if I had any opinions on the situation in the Far East, if I sent them to him, he would find a good place to publish them" ("Zanghui Studio Notes," Volume 15).
    In July 1917, he returned to Shanghai, "having just resolved not to talk about politics for twenty years, wanting to build an innovative foundation for Chinese politics in thought and literature," intending to start from the aspects of thought and literature to gain a leading position in politics. However, in reality, he never forgot to collude with reactionary forces in China. After arriving in Beijing from Shanghai to take up a professorship at Peking University, he immediately went with the Englishman Reginald Johnston to meet the deposed Emperor Puyi. According to Hu Shi himself, "He called me 'teacher,' and I called him 'Your Majesty.'" Jin Liang, in his memorial requesting an audience for Jiang Kanghu, clearly wrote: "His Majesty uses virtue to subdue people. After Hu Shi met him, he was transformed by His Majesty."
    In 1919, the May Fourth Movement occurred. The Chinese people rose up to oppose the recognition of the Shandong clauses in the Paris Peace Conference, demanded the punishment of traitors, and launched a boycott of Japanese goods. Not only did students and workers in various places strike and demonstrate, but also merchants in Tianjin and Shanghai once went on strike. This movement had a clear anti-imperialist and anti-feudal nature, which greatly shocked reactionary forces at home and abroad.
    Although the main thrust of this movement was directed at Japanese imperialism and pro-Japanese warlords and bureaucrats, it also involved the Paris Peace Conference, where imperialist powers divided the spoils. The vast patriotic movement of the masses was something that imperialism abhorred. Hu Shi, like American imperialism at the time, greatly disapproved of the patriotic movement of the masses. When the movement occurred, he was still in Shanghai welcoming Dewey to China to "lecture." By the time he returned to Beijing, students at Peking University and other schools were still on strike. He was greatly dissatisfied and came forward to persuade the students to resume classes, even proposing to move Peking University to Shanghai, attempting to sabotage the May Fourth Movement.
    Hu Shi's activities to sabotage the May Fourth Movement were not successful. The movement continued to advance along the path of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism and began to accept the guidance of Marxism-Leninism. In November 1918, Comrade Li Dazhao published the article "The Victory of Bolshevism" in "New Youth," and Marxism-Leninism gained widespread dissemination during the May Fourth Movement. Hu Shi quickly felt that this was the guiding ideology of the mass movement and desperately tried to oppose Marxism-Leninism. In June 1919, he believed that "the 'new' elements in the country kept silent about concrete political issues, but talked grandly about anarchism and Marxism. I couldn't stand it, I couldn't bear it anymore—because I am a believer in experimentalism—so I was determined to talk about politics" ("My Fork in the Road"). In July, he published the article "Problems and Doctrines," saying that "talking emptily about pleasant 'doctrines' is extremely easy, it is something that any Tom, Dick, or Harry can do, it is something that parrots and gramophones can do"; "empty talk about imported 'doctrines' is useless"; "being biased towards 'doctrines' on paper is very dangerous. This kind of catchphrase is easily used by shameless politicians to do all sorts of harmful things," etc., attempting to persuade people to believe in pragmatism and guide them to use pragmatism to "study more problems," in order to prevent the spread of Marxism-Leninism in China and its combination with the mass movement.
    Hu Shi's trick of "exchanging the raccoon cat for the prince" did not have much effect. At that time, the "New Youth" magazine still published many articles about Marxism-Leninism. These articles had a great impact on society and played a guiding role in the revolutionary movement at that time. In this way, Hu Shi again tried to dismantle the "New Youth" platform. At the end of 1920, he stirred up a storm, demanding a change in the content of "New Youth." In a letter to Chen Duxiu, the editor of "New Youth" at the time, he said: "'New Youth's' color is too distinct," which he "did not approve of." "If we want 'New Youth' to 'change its content,' we cannot do it unless we restore our covenant of 'not talking about politics.'" When he felt that he could not change the content of "New Youth," he wanted to start another publication to oppose "New Youth." In a letter to his colleagues at "New Youth," he said: "Now 'New Youth' is almost a Chinese translation of 'Soviet Russian' (referring to the Soviet magazine at that time), so I want to create another magazine specifically about academic arts and literature."
    After this, what kind of politics did Hu Shi talk about? The politics he talked about were just platitudes such as "good government," "provincial autonomy," and "America does not invade China."
    At this time, the United States attempted to establish a nominally unified government on the basis of warlord forces in order to carry out political and economic aggression. Hu Shi desperately chimed in. He wore the mask of "down with the warlords" to sell the political goods of American imperialism. He said: "A federal system based on provincial autonomy is an important weapon for overthrowing the warlords today" ("Provincial Autonomy and Warlord Separatism"). On the other hand, he shouted so-called "good government," attempting to use the anesthetic of "reform" to anesthetize the Chinese people. Especially after the Chinese Communist Party issued the declaration of the Second National Congress, which first proposed the slogan of "down with international imperialism" in China, directly hitting the head of American imperialism, Hu Shi barked even more ferociously. He said that "foreign investors hope for peace and unity in China no less than the Chinese people hope for peace and unity," "we can try to recall the amazing loans exclusively borrowed by Japan in the 7th and 8th years of the Republic of China, and then look at the passive effects of these years since the establishment of the new banking consortium, and we can understand that the American bourgeoisie may not be entirely malicious towards China," "when politics are chaotic, when the whole country is in a state of anarchy, or when political power is in the hands of soldiers and traitors, the people only feel that concessions and the Legation Quarter are blessed places, foreign currency is gold-like currency, the Inspector General of Customs is a god, and it is China's good fortune that customs and postal power is in the hands of foreigners!" ("International China"). At this time, his tone was exactly the same as that of a lawyer for an American firm.
    Hu Shi was not only an enemy of the Chinese Communist Party, but also attacked Sun Yat-sen. He reversed black and white and said: "Sun's advocacy of using Guangdong as a base to achieve a unified Republic of China... does not hesitate to go against the tide to achieve his goals... Chen Jiongming's faction's overthrow of Sun Wen's power in Guangdong this time was a kind of revolution" ("This Week").
    Hu Shi also tried every possible way to disintegrate the mass movement at that time and the impending revolutionary upsurge. He insisted that "a great revolution—a democratic revolution—will not be realized for a while; hoping to use a great revolution to achieve unity is also drawing a cake that cannot satisfy hunger." He also said: "Strikes are very clumsy and passive weapons, difficult to use and even more difficult to sustain." He shouted to young men and women students across the country: "Parading in lines and shouting 'Down with the British and Japanese robbers' is not a national salvation cause... The country's turmoil and external stimuli should only increase your enthusiasm and interest in learning."
    In 1924, after the Second Zhili-Fengtian War, American influence in China was relatively weakened, so it agreed to convene the "Post-War Conference" to compromise with Japan. This spoils-sharing conference was strongly rejected by the Kuomintang, led by Sun Yat-sen. Hu Shi wagged his tail and participated in this conference.
    Because of Hu Shi's consistent loyalty to his master, he was even more appreciated by American imperialism. In 1925, the "China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture," the center of American imperialist cultural aggression against China, was established, and Hu Shi was invited to be the "Honorary Secretary." From then on, Hu Shi openly became an agent of American imperialists.
    Then came the climax of the Chinese revolution, and the Northern Expedition began. American imperialism hoped that the revolutionary army of the Northern Expedition would directly conflict with the British and Japanese forces—the Zhili-Fengtian warlords—in order to profit from it. If the Zhili-Fengtian forces won, they could use the hands of the British and Japanese to eliminate the Chinese revolutionary forces. At the same time, they could weaken the Zhili-Fengtian forces. If the revolutionary army won successive victories, they could use the revolutionary army to drive out British and Japanese forces, and then try to buy over the upper-level elements in the revolutionary camp to dominate China alone. At that time, although Hu Shi was far away in England, he also notified his accomplice Ding Wenjiang to instigate Sun Chuanfang to remain inactive, attempting to make Wu Peifu and the Northern Expeditionary Army suffer both losses, and then clean up the situation.
    Stalin said that the comprador bourgeoisie was the deadly enemy of the revolutionary party—the Kuomintang—during the first Northern Expedition in China. Hu Shi was a representative of the pro-American group in this class.
    This is Hu Shi's ugly history before and after the May Fourth Movement.
    What do we see from these historical facts?
    We can see that before the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shi already had very strong comprador ideas, and his political statements and actions were in line with American imperialist policy towards China everywhere. He opposed the Xinhai Revolution led by Sun Yat-sen and supported Yuan Shikai, who represented feudal comprador forces. During the May Fourth Movement, he openly opposed the patriotic movement of the masses and Marxism. After 1922, he officially became an agent of American imperialism, colluding with feudal forces according to the will of American imperialism. He adopted a hostile attitude towards the Chinese Communist Party and the broad masses of working people, and he spared no effort to slander Sun Yat-sen, a representative of the bourgeois democrats. Therefore, on the whole, he was always concerned about the interests of American imperialism and the pro-American comprador group. As the Chinese people's revolutionary movement deepened and widened, Hu Shi's true colors became more and more exposed.
    But when some people reminisce about the past, they always feel that Hu Shi was after all a remarkable figure at that time: didn't he advocate vernacular Chinese? Didn't he participate in the New Culture Movement and therefore also engage in the "anti-feudal" struggle?
    When it comes to Hu Shi's "achievements" in the New Culture Movement, it is best to quote his own words to judge.
    Hu Shi said in the article "Fifty Years of Chinese Literature":
    "The advocacy of the literary revolution was initially just a few private discussions, and it was not until January of the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917) that it was officially published in magazines. The first article, 'A Preliminary Discussion on Literary Improvement' by Hu Shi, was still a peaceful discussion. Hu Shi's attitude towards literature has always been one of historical evolution...
    Hu Shi himself often said that his historical addiction was too deep, so he was not worthy of revolutionary work. The most important vanguard of the literary revolution was his friend Chen Duxiu. Following 'A Preliminary Discussion on Literary Improvement,' Chen Duxiu published an article 'On Literary Revolution' (February of the sixth year), officially raising the banner of 'literary revolution.'"
    In another article, Hu Shi regarded this process of participating in the "literary revolution" as being "forced to go to Liangshan."
    In fact, where did Hu Shi ever go to "Liangshan"? He did not feel that a major reform was needed for the content of literature. What he wanted to reform was only the literary style, a literary form.
    He said in the article "On Constructive Literary Revolution":
    "The only purpose of my 'On Constructing a New Literature' is only ten big characters: 'Vernacular literature, literary vernacular.' The literary revolution we advocate is only to create a kind of vernacular literature for China."
    In the article "Forced to Go to Liangshan," he also said:
    "The literary revolution that China needs today is a revolution to replace classical Chinese with vernacular Chinese, a revolution to replace dead tools with living tools."
    But what exactly is the "vernacular Chinese" that he advocated?
    He said: "We can try our best to use the vernacular of 'Water Margin,' 'Journey to the West,' 'The Scholars,' and 'Dream of the Red Chamber'; if there are any that do not meet today's needs, we will not use them; if there are not enough, we will use today's vernacular to supplement them; if we have to use classical Chinese, we will use classical Chinese to supplement them."
    That is to say, modern "vernacular" is only in a supplementary position like classical Chinese. Therefore, this kind of "vernacular Chinese" was ridiculed as a "mule literature" that was neither donkey nor horse.
    Hu Shi's "achievement" lies here!
    Does this kind of "achievement" have anti-feudal significance?
    Hu Shi bit the bullet and refused to admit that he had ever opposed feudalism. In 1935, he confessed: "I searched my half-life history, and I don't know that I have ever had the 'glory of fighting with feudalism.' I have no idea what this forty-year-old Chinese 'feudalism' looks like" ("A Major Malady in Today's Ideological Circles").
    These words can explain that Hu Shi has never opposed feudalism.
    There is no doubt that the transition from classical Chinese to vernacular Chinese is a reform. In feudal society, the landlord class worked hard to treat literary language as their exclusive property, dividing literary language from the national language, so there was a rigid classical Chinese. But after capitalism emerged and developed, "language uniformity is an important factor for fully obtaining the domestic market and complete freedom of economic circulation" (Lenin: "Critical Remarks on the National Question"). And to have language uniformity, it is necessary to establish literature on the basis of the national language, abolish the old literary language, and use the new literary language to promote language unity. Most of the more developed countries in the world have gone through this process.
    In China, the situation is also the same. The reform from classical Chinese to vernacular Chinese also represents the requirements of capitalist economic development.
    But China at that time was a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. The situation at that time was: "Imperialist powers have created a comprador and commercial usury exploitation network from China's commercial cities to remote rural areas, creating a comprador class and a commercial usury class to serve imperialism, in order to facilitate their exploitation of the vast Chinese peasants and other people" (Mao Zedong: "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party"). At that time, the United States was afraid that China would be monopolized by British, Japanese, and other imperialists, and put forward slogans such as "Open Door" and "China's Territorial and Administrative Integrity," attempting to infiltrate economically and then seek to dominate China alone. Therefore, it especially strengthened trade with China. In 1913, Sino-US trade accounted for only 7.51% of China's total foreign trade, but by 1919, it had risen to 16.55%. Without a unified language, how could commercial activities be carried out? So Hu Shi reflected this requirement.
    Hu Shi's "plan" for the "literary revolution" was roughly drafted in the United States reactionary cultural base—Columbia University—and sent back to China for publication. When Hu Shi sang the highest tune of "vernacular Chinese," he was also regarding the United States as "heaven," praising Dewey as a "sage," and treating the U.S. government's policy towards China as "imperial decree." Could he still stand on the position of national capitalism to oppose feudalism?
    Imperialism and feudal forces are of course extremely reactionary and are both pressing on the people's heads. But there is not a complete lack of contradictions between the two. Imperialism increasingly demanded that Chinese feudal forces succumb to it. It often signaled to Chinese feudal forces: "You old guys, the old ways won't work, learn from us!" This kind of imperialist signal was broadcast through the loudspeakers of people like Hu Shi:
    "I very impolitely criticized our Oriental civilization and enthusiastically praised Western modern civilization" ("Our Attitude Towards Western Modern Civilization"). Hu Shi's tune did not change much until after the failure of the First Revolutionary Civil War.
    Don't think that this is a fight between two gangs of robbers. Feudal forces are ultimately the main social foundation for imperialism to rule China, and imperialism will try its best to support this most reactionary and backward force. This contradictory and unified attitude is also reflected in Hu Shi's words and actions. Hu Shi has never adopted a fundamentally negative attitude towards feudal forces. On the contrary, he often colludes with feudal forces. He only demanded "small and piecemeal improvements" to the feudal system, and the promotion of vernacular Chinese did not damage a single hair of the feudal warlord regime. As for opposing bound feet, funeral reforms, and not being slaves of Confucius... etc., it was nothing more than using these "small and piecemeal improvements" to make it more suitable for the interests of American imperialism and the pro-American comprador group.
    People want to ask: Didn't Hu Shi support the new trend of thought of "Mr. De" (democracy) and "Mr. Sai" (science)? How to explain this phenomenon? It is best to explain it in Hu Shi's own words. He said: "According to my personal observation, the fundamental meaning of the new trend of thought is only a new attitude. This new attitude can be called 'the critical attitude'... The critical attitude contains several special requirements:
    (1) For the systems and customs passed down by tradition, ask: 'Does this system still have value for existence?'
    (2) For the teachings of sages inherited from ancient times, ask: 'Is this sentence still correct today?'
    (3) For the confused and publicly recognized behaviors and beliefs in society, ask: 'Will it not be wrong if everyone agrees? Should I do the same as others? Isn't there another way to do it that is better, more rational, and more beneficial?'" Hu Shi finally summarized that these are all for "small and piecemeal transformations" ("The Meaning of the New Trend of Thought"). Ah, it's this set again! Hu Shi's "reformism" is entirely something to help American imperialism trick the Chinese people.
    Naturally, the contradiction between imperialism and feudal forces is objectively beneficial to the revolution. Hu Shi's advocacy of vernacular Chinese and other statements and actions may also have been beneficial to the revolution objectively, but one cannot think that Hu Shi played a major role in the revolutionary movement.
    Some people don't believe it, but Hu Shi admitted this a long time ago. See what he said:
    "I talk about politics just to practice my experimentalism, just as I talk about vernacular Chinese just to practice my experimentalism."
    And experimentalism happens to be a reactionary philosophy that defends the interests of American imperialism! Using this "tool" to observe and judge social phenomena cannot but be reactionary!
    After World War I, the center of financial power in the capitalist world, the center of financial capital exploitation, had shifted from Europe to the United States. American imperialism made every effort to expand its sphere of influence to every corner of the world. China, with its large population and rich resources, first became the place where it and other imperialists competed for hegemony. Along with the political and economic hegemony came the cultural hegemony. And the peak of American reactionary culture—the bacteria of pragmatism—was brought to China by Hu Shi and spread to China's academic, cultural, and educational circles. In this way, in reactionary culture, feudal culture retreated to a subordinate position, while imperialist culture took the upper hand. Hu Shi's reorganization of national heritage with pragmatism won the praise of many people, which is a sign of American imperialist culture riding on the neck of feudal culture.
    Around the time of the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shi, this monster, was the most able to confuse people. One moment he was a "general" of the "literary revolution," and the next he was a new bureaucrat colluding with feudal forces; one moment he was a Western lackey talking about American civilization, and the next he was a scholar reorganizing national heritage; one moment he was a "good old man" who "didn't talk about politics," and the next he was a mad dog that opposed communism and the people... But as long as we collect various concrete facts and analyze them with Marxism-Leninism, he will always reveal his true colors.
    Look, what is in the demon-revealing mirror?
    A dog, a running dog with an American collar!

    “五四”运动前后胡适的政治面目
    曾文经
    中国近代史上出现过这样一个大骗局：胡适在“五四”运动前后提倡了白话文，吹了许多牛皮，弄得许多人黑白不分，以为胡适是“五四”运动的领导人物。
    这真是滑天下之大稽！胡适那里是这样的角色！根据事实来分析，他原来是美帝国主义训练出来的买办学者和政客。
    胡适是美帝国主义者用“退还”的庚子赔款送到美国留学的。他到美国不久，就“对于那个国家和人民都很喜爱”，感到“在这个地方，似乎无一事一物不能由人类智力做得成的”（“我的信仰”）。他对美国的一切，都崇拜得五体投地。他对国内政治的看法，也开始受到美国对华政策的深刻影响了。
    一九一一年五月，四国银行团和满清政府订立借款合同和美国直接掌握粤汉、宜夔两路路权，引起了湖南、湖北、四川、广东各地商民的“保路”风潮，爆发成为辛亥革命。
    美国政府对于辛亥革命是采取反对态度的，它一味拒绝承认当时的南京临时政府，就是反对的表示。
    胡适那时对辛亥革命，也表示反对。每当留美学生谈论这一事件，他总是用英语说：“我赞成渐进，不赞成革命。”
    胡适在辛亥革命之后，到美国哥仑比亚大学，就学于杜威。从此以后，他的脑中就充满了美国反动哲学——实用主义的毒素。
    一九一五年，日本帝国主义提出“二十一条件”要袁世凯接受，而拿承认帝制作为交换。美国是赞同日本这样干的。“四国银行团”一书就透露出这个秘密：“美国国务院的目的，就是要给予日本以愿意获得的利益”。在五月九日袁世凯在这亡国条件上签字后，美国国务院在给中日两国的内容相同的照会中也声明：“美国坦白承认领土的毗连，造成日本和这些区域（指山东、南满及东蒙）之特殊关系”。
    胡适还支持了袁世凯的卖国行为。他在袁世凯签字之前，看到“留美学生，人人都赞成即与日本开战”，就“写了一封公开的信给中国留美学生月报，劝告处之以温和，持之以冷静”，就是“被斥为卖国贼”也置之不顾（“我的信仰”）。在袁世凯签字的次日，他在自己札记中这样写道：“吾国此项对日交涉，可谓知已知彼，既知持重，又能有所不挠，能柔也能刚，此为历来外交史所未见”（“藏晖室札记”卷九）。
    在袁世凯死后，他还大为惋惜，说：“袁氏当是时（辛亥革命开始后），内揽大权，外得列强之赞助，傥彼果能善用此千载一时之机会，以致吾国于治安之域，则生荣死哀，固意中事耳。”（“藏晖室札记”卷十五）。
    胡适在美国，和美国反动政治也有瓜葛。他曾访问美国退任总统塔虎脱，说他是“一个好人”（“藏晖室札记”卷九），并参加美国竞选活动，“主张威氏之连任”（“藏晖室札记”卷十五）。他在回国前夕，曾向美国反动哲学家杜威辞行。他自己谈到当时情景：“先生（指杜威）言其关心于国际政局之问题乃过于他事。嘱适有关于远东时局之言论，若寄彼处，当代为觅善地发言之”（“藏晖室札记”卷十五）。
    一九一七年七月，他回到上海，“方才打定二十年不谈政治的决心，要想在思想文艺上替中国政治建筑一个革新的基础”，即打算从思想文艺方面着手，去取得政治的领导地位。可是，事实上，他却并没有忘怀和中国反动势力互相勾搭。他由上海到北京就任北京大学教授后，马上和英国人庄士敦一起去觐见宣统废帝。个中情形，据胡适自道：“他称我先生，我称他皇上”。而金梁在为江亢虎请觐折上则明明这样写：“皇上以德服人，昔胡适既见后，为皇上所化”。
    一九一九年，“五四”运动发生，中国人民起来反对承认巴黎和会中的山东条款，要求惩办卖国贼，开展抵制日货运动。不但各地学生、工人纷纷罢课、罢工、示威游行，就是天津、上海的商人也曾一度罢市。这个运动具有鲜明的反帝反封建性质，它使国内外反动势力大吃一惊。
    虽然这一运动的主要锋芒是指向日本帝国主义及亲日的军阀官僚，但也涉及帝国主义分赃的巴黎和会。而波澜壮阔的群众爱国运动，则是帝国主义所嫉恶的。胡适当时和美帝国主义一样，对于当时的群众爱国运动，大不以为然。在运动发生时，他因迎接杜威来华“讲学”，尚在上海。等到他回到北京，北京大学和其他学校学生还在罢课。他大大不满，出面劝说学生复课，甚至还提议把北京大学迁到上海，企图破坏“五四”运动。
    胡适破坏“五四”运动的活动并没有成功。这个运动继续向着反帝反封建的道路前进，并开始接受马克思列宁主义思想的指导。一九一八年十一月李大钊同志在“新青年”发表“布尔塞维主义的胜利”一文，马克思列宁主义在“五四”运动中获得了广泛的传播。胡适很快就感到这是群众运动的指导思想，就拚命想法来反对马克思列宁主义。在一九一九年六月，他认为“国内的‘新’分子闭口不谈具体的政治问题，却高谈什么无政府主义与马克思主义。我看不过了，忍不住了，——因为我是一个实验主义的信徒，——于是发愤要想谈政治。”（“我的歧路”）七月间，他发表了“问题与主义”一文，说什么“空谈好听的‘主义’，是极容易的事，是阿猫阿狗都能做的事，是鹦鹉和留声机器都能做的事”；“空谈外来进口的‘主义’是没有什么用处的”；“偏向纸上的‘主义’，是很危险的。这种口头禅很容易被无耻政客利用来做种种害人的事”等等，企图说服人们去信奉实用主义，引导人们运用实用主义去“多研究些问题”，以便阻挡马克思列宁主义在中国的传播和与群众运动的结合。
    胡适这种“狸猫换太子”的诡计，并没有收到很大效果。当时“新青年”杂志上仍然发表许多关于马克思列宁主义的文章。这些文章在社会上发生很大影响，对当时的革命运动起了指导作用。这样一来，胡适又设法去拆“新青年”的台了。一九二○年底，他搅起一场风波，要求改变“新青年”的内容。他在给当时“新青年”主编陈独秀的信中说：“‘新青年’色彩过于鲜明”，他“不以为然”。“若要‘新青年’‘改变内容’，非恢复我们‘不谈政治’的戒约，不能做到。”当他感到无法改变“新青年”内容之后，又想办另外一种刊物来和“新青年”对抗，他在给“新青年”社同人的信中说：“今‘新青年’差不多成了Soviet Russian（按即当时苏联杂志——“苏俄”）的汉译本，故我想另创一个专关学术艺文的杂志”。
    在这以后，胡适到底谈了什么政治呢？他谈的政治，只是“好人政府”、“联省自治”、“美国不侵略中国”等等滥调。
    这时，美国企图在军阀势力的基础上建立一个有名无实的统一政府，以便进行政治侵略和经济侵略。胡适也就拚命地帮腔。他戴上“打倒军阀”的假面具来推销美帝国主义的政治商品。他说：“根据于省自治的联邦制，是今日打倒军阀的一个重要武器”（“联省自治与军阀割据”）。另一方面又高喊所谓“好人政府”，企图用“改良”的麻醉剂来麻醉中国人民。特别是在中国共产党发表第二次代表大会宣言，在中国第一次提出“打倒国际帝国主义”的口号，直接打击到美帝国主义的头上之后，胡适更恶狠狠地狂吠起来。说什么“外国投资者的希望中国和平与统一，实在不下于中国人民的希望和平与统一”，“我们试回想民国七八年的日本独借的惊人大款，再看看新银行团成立以后这几年的消极的效果，就可以明白美国资产阶级对中国的未必全怀恶意了”，“政治纷乱的时候，全国陷入无政府的时候，或者政权在武人奸人的手里的时候，人民只觉得租界与东交民巷是福地，外币是金不换的货币，总税务司是神人，海关邮政权在外人手里是中国的幸事！”（“国际的中国”）这时，他的口吻，已经和美国洋行的辩护士一模一样了。
    胡适不但和中国共产党为敌，同时也攻击孙中山。他颠倒黑白地说：“孙氏主张用广东作根据，做到统一的中华民国……不惜倒行逆施以求达他的目的。……陈炯明一派这一次推翻孙文在广东的势力，这本是一种革命。”（“这一周”）
    胡适对于当时的群众运动和行将到来的革命高潮，也想尽一切方法进行瓦解。他硬说“大革命——民主主义的大革命——是一时不会实现的；希望用大革命来统一，也是画饼不能充饥。”又说：“罢工罢市是很笨重的消极武器，很难使用，更难持久。”他向全国青年男女学生喝道：“排队游街，高喊‘打倒英日强盗’，算不得救国事业。……国家的纷扰，外间的刺激，只应该增加你求学的热心与兴趣。”
    一九二四年，在第二次直奉战争之后，美国在华势力相对削弱，于是同意召开“善后会议”，和日本妥协。这个分赃会议，当时曾受到以孙中山为首的国民党的严词拒绝。胡适却摇着尾巴参加了这个会议。
    由于胡适对他的主子一贯忠诚，他更加被美帝国主义赏识了。一九二五年，美帝国主义对华文化侵略中心——“中华文化教育基金董事会”成立，就请胡适当“名誉秘书”，从此胡适就公开地成为美帝国主义者的代理人了。
    接着是中国革命进入高潮，北伐战争开始。美帝国主义希望北伐的革命军和英日势力——直奉军阀直接冲突，以便从中取利。如果直奉战胜，则可假借英日之手，消灭中国革命势力。同时又可削弱直奉军力。如果革命军节节胜利，则可假借革命军驱逐英日势力，然后设法收卖革命阵营中的上层分子，独霸中国。胡适那时虽然远在英国，也通知他的同伙丁文江去怂恿孙传芳按兵不动，企图使吴佩孚和北伐军两败俱伤，再来收拾局面。
    斯大林曾说，买办资产阶级在中国第一次北伐时期是当时革命政党——国民党的死敌。胡适就是这个阶级中亲美集团的代表人物。
    这就是胡适在“五四”运动前后的丑恶历史。
    从这些历史事实，我们看到一些什么呢？
    我们可以看到：胡适在“五四”运动之前，已经有非常浓厚的买办思想，他有关政治的言论和行动，已经和美帝国主义的对华政策处处吻合。他反对孙中山领导的辛亥革命，赞成代表封建买办势力的袁世凯。在“五四”运动当中，他公开反对群众爱国运动和马克思主义。在一九二二年之后，他正式成为美帝国主义的代理人，随着美帝国主义的意旨和封建势力互相勾搭。他对中国共产党和广大劳动群众，采取仇视态度，对孙中山这样一个资产阶级民主派的代表人物，也不顾一切进行诽谤。因而，从整个看来，他一向关心的只是美帝国主义和亲美买办集团的利益。随着中国人民革命运动的深入和广泛展开，胡适的真面目就越来越暴露了。
    但有些人们在怀念往事的时候，总觉得胡适当时毕竟是个了不起的人物：他不是提倡白话文的吗？他不是参加过新文化运动，因而也曾进行过
  “反封建”的斗争吗？
    谈到胡适在新文化运动中的“功绩”，最好还是引用他自己的话来评判。
    胡适在“五十年来中国之文学”一文中说：
    “文学革命的主张，起初只是几个私人的讨论，到民国六年（一九一七）一月方才正式在杂志上发表。第一篇胡适的‘文学改良刍议’还是很和平的讨论。胡适对于文学的态度，始终只是一个历史进化的态度。……
    胡适自己常说他的历史癖太深，故不配作革命的事业。文学革命的进行，最重要的急先锋是他的朋友陈独秀。陈独秀接着‘文学改良刍议’之后，发表了一篇‘文学革命论’（六年二月），正式举起‘文学革命’的旗子。”
    胡适在另外一篇文章中把这一段参加“文学革命”的过程，当作“逼上梁山”。
    其实，胡适那里上过“梁山”呢？他对于文学的内容，并未感到需要进行重大改革，他所要改革的只是文体，一种文学的形式。
    他在“建设的文学革命论”一文中说：
    “我的‘建设新文学论’的唯一宗旨只有十个大字：‘国语的文学，文学的国语’。我们所提倡的文学革命，只是要替中国创造一种国语的文学。”
    在“逼上梁山”一文中他也说：
    “中国今日需要的文学革命是用白话替代古文的革命，是用活的工具替代死的工具的革命。”
    可是，他所提倡的“白话文”究竟是什么东西呢？
    他说：“我们可尽量采用‘水浒’‘西游记’
  ‘儒林外史’‘红楼梦’的白话；有不合今日的用的，便不用他；有不够用的，便用今日的白话来补助；有不得不用文言的，便用文言来补助。”
    这就是说，现代“国语”只是和文言一样处在补助的地位。因而这样的“白话文”，就被人们讥笑为非驴非马的“骡子文学”。
    胡适的“功绩”就在这里！
    这种“功绩”有没有反封建的意义呢？
    胡适是一口咬定，不承认自己曾经反对过封建主义的。他在一九三五年曾作如此自白：“我搜索我半生的历史，我就不知道我曾有过‘与封建主义争斗的光荣’。压根儿我不知道这四十年的中国
  ‘封建主义’是个什么样子。”（“今日思想界的一个大弊病”）
    这些话可以说明，胡适向来就没有反对过封建主义。
    毫无疑问，从古文到白话文，是一种改革。在封建社会里，地主阶级努力把文学语言当作自己独占的财产，把文学语言从全民语言中划分出来，这样就有了僵死的古文。但在资本主义出现和发展起来之后，“语言同一性对于完全取得国内市场和经济流通的完全自由是一个重要的因素”（列宁：“关于民族问题的批评意见”）。而要有语言同一性，就必须把文学建立在全民语言的基础上，废除老朽的文学语言，利用新的文学语言，去促成语言的统一。较为发展的世界各国，都是经过这种过程的。
    在中国，情形也是如此。古文到白话文的改革，也是代表资本主义的经济发展的要求的。
    但那时的中国是半殖民地半封建的国家。当时的情形是：“帝国主义列强从中国的通商都市直至穷乡僻壤，造成了一个买办的和商业高利贷的剥削网，造成了为帝国主义服务的买办阶级和商业高利贷阶级，以便利其剥削广大的中国农民和其他人民大众。”（毛泽东：“中国革命和中国共产党”）美国当时怕中国被英、日等帝国主义独占，曾提出“门户开放”“中国领土行政完整”等口号，企图以经济渗入方式，进而谋独霸中国，因而它特别加强对华贸易。一九一三年，中美贸易在中国对外贸易总额中只占百分之七·五一，到一九一九年，却已上升到百分之一六·五五了。如果没有统一的语言，怎好进行商业活动呢？于是胡适反映了这个要求。
    胡适的“文学革命”的“计划”，是在美国反动文化大本营——哥仑比亚大学大体拟就送回国发表的。胡适“白话文”的调子唱得最高的时候，他也正把美国看成“天堂”，把杜威捧成“圣人”，把美国政府对华政策当作“圣旨”，难道他还能站在民族资本主义的立场上来反对封建主义吗？
    帝国主义和封建势力当然都是极端反动，都是压在人民头上的。但两者之间，并不是完全没有矛盾。帝国主义越来越要求中国封建势力屈从于它。它常常向中国封建势力示意：“你这个老家伙，旧的一套不成了，学我们这一套吧！”帝国主义这种示意，正是通过胡适一流人的喇叭筒转播出来：
  “我很不客气的指摘我们的东方文明，很热烈的颂扬西洋的近代文明”（“我们对于西洋近代文明的态度”），胡适这种调子，直到第一次国内革命战争失败之后，一直没有多大改变。
    千万不要以为这是两伙强盗的火并。封建势力终究是帝国主义统治中国的主要社会基础，帝国主义是要极力支持这种最反动最落后的势力的。这种矛盾而又统一的态度，也表现在胡适的言论行动上。胡适对封建势力从来没有采取根本否定的态度，恰巧相反，他经常和封建势力勾勾搭搭。他对封建制度，只要求“一点一滴的改良”，白话文的推行并没有损坏封建军阀政权的一根毫毛。至于反对小脚，丧礼改革、不要做孔丘的奴隶……等等，也无非借助这“一点一滴的改良”，使它更适合于美帝国主义和亲美买办集团的利益。
    人们要问：胡适不是赞成过拥护“德”“赛”（民主和科学）两先生的新思潮么？怎样解释这种现象呢？最好还是用胡适的话来解释。他说：“据我个人的观察，新思潮的根本意义只是一种新态度。这种新态度可叫做‘评判的态度’。……评判的态度含有几种特别的要求：
    （一）对于习俗相传下来的制度风俗，要问：‘这种制度还有存在的价值吗？’
    （二）对于古代遗传下来的圣贤教训，要问：‘这句话在今日还是不错吗？’
    （三）对于社会上糊涂公认的行为与信仰，都要问：‘大家公认的，就不会错了吗？人家这样做，我也该这样做吗？难道没有别样做法比这个更好，更有理，更有益的吗？’”胡适最后归纳，这些都是为了“一点一滴的改造”（“新思潮的意义”）。啊，原来又是这一套！胡适的“改良主义”，完全是帮助美帝国主义捉弄中国人民的东西。
    自然，帝国主义和封建势力的矛盾，在客观上是对革命有利的。胡适提倡白话文等等言论行动，在客观上对革命也未尝没有好处，但不能就认为胡适在革命运动中起了多大作用。
    说来有些人不相信，然而胡适早就承认这一点了。看他怎样说的：
    “我谈政治只是实行我的实验主义，正如我谈白话文也只是实行我的实验主义。”
    而实验主义却偏偏是维护美帝国主义利益的反动哲学啊！用这个“工具”去观察和判断社会现象，没有不反动的！
    在第一次世界大战之后，资本主义世界的财政势力中心，财政资本剥削的中心，已从欧洲移到美国。美帝国主义尽一切努力到世界各个角落去扩张势力范围，人口众多、物产丰富的中国，首先就成为它和其他帝国主义争霸的场所。随着政治和经济的争霸而来的，也就是文化上的夺取霸权。而美国反动文化的最高峰——实用主义哲学的细菌，就由胡适带到中国来，传染到中国的学术界、文化界和教育界。这样一来，在反动文化中，封建文化就退居于屈从地位，帝国主义文化则占了上风。胡适用实用主义整理国故，博得许多人赞赏，就是美帝国主义文化骑在封建文化脖子上的征象。
    在“五四”运动前后，胡适这个妖怪是最能迷惑人的。他一会儿是“文学革命”的“健将”，另一会儿又是与封建势力同流合污的新官僚；一会儿是高谈美国文明的西崽，另一会儿又是整理国故的学究；一会儿是“不谈政治”的“老好人”，另一会儿又是反共反人民的疯狗。……但只要我们把各种具体事实搜集起来，再加以马克思列宁主义的分析，他总会原形毕露的。
    看，照妖镜里是什么东西？
    一只狗，套着美国项圈的走狗！
