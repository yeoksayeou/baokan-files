    Another Railway Line Opens in the Lesser Khingan Mountains
    In the forests of the Lesser Khingan Mountains in Northeast China, another newly built railway line – the Shuang (zihe) - Wu (ying) section of the Tanglin Line – was officially handed over to the Nancha Engineering Section of the Qiqihar Railway Administration for operation on December 1. The Shuang-Wu section of the railway is 61 kilometers long and located in a sparsely populated forest area. In the undulating mountains, there are abundant construction resources: Korean pine, larch, birch... Now, train after train of timber, through the new Shuang-Wu railway section, is being continuously transported to all parts of the country to support the country's economic construction.

    小兴安岭又有一段铁路通车
    在祖国东北小兴安岭的树海里，又有一段新建成的铁路——汤林线双（子河）五（营）段，于十二月一日正式移交给齐齐哈尔铁路管理局南岔工务段营业。双五段铁路全长六十一公里，处在漫无人烟的林区。在绵互起伏的丛山里，蕴藏着丰富的建设资源：红松、落叶松、桦树……现在，一列车一列车的木材，通过双五段新的铁路，正源源不断地运往全国各地，支援祖国的经济建设。（黄洪腾）
