Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 4th: The "Pravda" published an article by Soviet Marshal Vasilevsky entitled: "Dangerous Playing with Fire - On Marshal Montgomery's Atomic War Cries."

    Marshal Vasilevsky pointed out that British Marshal Montgomery, who serves in the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's forces under the command of American General Gruenther, has recently made frequent remarks advocating the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons against peace-loving people around the world, and against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, in the event of a military conflict. On October 8th, he stated in Ankara that atomic weapons should be used. On October 21st, he said: "The Allied Supreme Headquarters is basing their plans on the use of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons." On November 11th, he gave a speech in Ottawa, advocating the unrestricted use of atomic weapons. Finally, on November 30th, he issued atomic weapons threats in Los Angeles, demanding that the American command tell the Russians: "We will give them a hard time."

    Vasilevsky pointed out that Montgomery had praised atomic weapons as early as 1949, and said: Montgomery's constant cries for atomic war have aroused great indignation among the Soviet people, as among all peace-loving people. One can understand the wild remarks made by irresponsible American congressmen waving atomic bombs: they themselves do not know what they are talking about. However, it is not only presumptuous but even worse for a British marshal, who should clearly recognize the horrors of such a war (especially for a country like Britain), to shout for atomic war.

    Vasilevsky condemned Montgomery's indifference to the fate of the people and his fanaticism for atomic war. He reminded Montgomery that there is always a distance between the desire to give others a "hard time" and the possibility of realizing this desire.

    Vasilevsky said: In the winter of 1944 to 1945, the Germans gave the American and British forces in the Ardennes a "hard time." At that time, you had to urgently request assistance from the Soviet command. It was thanks to this assistance that you were not completely defeated in Belgium and suffered a "second Dunkirk." You should remember this before making so-called remarks about "giving the Russians a hard time."

    Vasilevsky reminded Montgomery: The Russians themselves are capable of giving a "hard time" to anyone who intends to hinder them from engaging in peaceful labor. Whoever dares to start a war will find himself in the most unenviable position. Everyone vividly remembers the experience of the Second World War. Since the defeat of Hitler's Germany, enormous changes have taken place in the world. Today, the Soviet Union is even stronger, and with it are the People's Republic of China with its 600 million people and other People's Democratic countries. This powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism is enthusiastically supported by the peace-loving people of all countries. At the same time, in these ten years, the development of Soviet military technology has achieved remarkable success.

    Vasilevsky said: The destructive power provided by military science is so great that even military personnel must recognize how necessary it is to prohibit atomic weapons and establish effective international supervision to implement this prohibition. Atomic and hydrogen bombs are weapons of mass extermination of peaceful residents, weapons of destruction of cities, and are especially dangerous to countries with small land areas and large populations. Forcing humanity to accept atomic war means committing a crime.

    Vasilevsky concluded: I must warn you: you are playing with fire in a dangerous way. As a well-known saying goes: "He who plays with fire gets burned." I advise you, Marshal, not to play with atomic war.

    危险的玩火行动
    ——华西列夫斯基元帅斥蒙哥马利的原子战争叫嚣
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：“真理报”刊载了苏联元帅华西列夫斯基的一篇文章，题目是：“危险的玩火行动——关于蒙哥马利元帅的原子战争叫嚷”。
    华西列夫斯基元帅指出：在美国将军格仑瑟的统率下、在北大西洋集团军队的司令部里任职的英国元帅蒙哥马利最近常常发表言论，主张一旦发生军事冲突就使用原子武器和氢武器来对付爱好和平的各国人民，来对付苏联和人民民主国家。十月八日，他在安卡拉表示要使用原子武器。十月二十一日，他说：“盟国总司令部正在以使用原子武器及热核子武器作他们的计划的基础。”十一月十一日，他在渥太华发表演说，赞成无限制地使用原子武器。最后，在十一月三十日，他又在洛杉矶发出了关于使用原子武器的恫吓。他要求美国司令部告诉俄国人：“我们要给他们苦头吃。”
    华西列夫斯基指出蒙哥马利早在一九四九年就赞扬过原子武器，并且说：蒙哥马利不断叫嚷要发动原子战争，这在苏联人民中间，正如在一切爱好和平的人民中间一样，引起了极大的愤怒。人们对挥舞着原子弹的不负责任的美国国会议员们发表的狂妄言论倒还能够理解：他们自己也不知道他们讲的是什么。但是，应该能够清楚地认识到这种战争的恐怖（特别是对英国这样的国家）的一个英国元帅，竟发出原子战争的叫嚣，这就不仅是狂妄，而且是更恶劣的事情了。
    华西列夫斯基谴责蒙哥马利对人民的命运的漠不关心和对原子战争的狂热。他提醒蒙哥马利说：在企图给别人“苦头吃”的愿望和实现这个愿望的可能性之间，总是有距离的。
    华西列夫斯基说：在一九四四年到一九四五年的冬季，德国人给在阿登省的美国和英国部队
  “苦头吃”。当时你不得不急如星火地要求苏联司令部援助。由于这种援助，你才没有在比利时遭到全军覆没和“第二次敦刻尔克”。你在发表所谓要“给俄国人苦头吃”的言论之前，应该记得这一点。
    华西列夫斯基提醒蒙哥马利：俄国人自己是能够给一切打算妨害他们从事和平劳动的人们
  “苦头吃”的。谁敢发动战争，谁就会发现他自己处在一种最无可羡慕的地位。所有的人对于第二次世界大战的经验记忆犹新。从希特勒德国战败的那个时候起，世界上已经发生了巨大的变化。今天苏联更加强大了，和它一起的有拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家，这个强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营得到爱好和平的各国人民的热烈支持。同时，在这十年中，苏联的军事技术发展已经取得了卓越的成就。
    华西列夫斯基说：军事科学所提供的摧毁力量是这样巨大，以致军人也必须认识到禁止原子武器和建立有效的国际监督来执行这种禁令是如何的必要。原子弹和氢弹是大规模消灭和平居民的武器，是毁灭城市的武器，而且是对土地狭小而人口众多的国家特别危险的武器。强迫人类接受原子战争意味着犯罪。
    华西列夫斯基最后说：我不得不向你提出警告：你是在作危险的玩火。一句大家都知道的俗语说：“玩火自焚”，我劝你，元帅，不要玩弄原子战争。
