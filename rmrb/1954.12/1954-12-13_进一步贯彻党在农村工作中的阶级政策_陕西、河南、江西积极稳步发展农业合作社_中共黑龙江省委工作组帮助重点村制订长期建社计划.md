Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Shaanxi, Henan, and Jiangxi provinces are actively and steadily developing agricultural production cooperatives.

These three provinces recently held mutual aid and cooperation work conferences. Based on the spirit of the Fourth Mutual Aid and Cooperation Work Conference convened by the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, they reviewed the situation of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and studied and arranged the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives in the coming winter and spring.

The mutual aid and cooperation work conferences in each province focused on examining and studying the issue of further implementing the Party's class policy in rural work, and determined the Party's specific leadership methods for the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The Shaanxi Provincial Mutual Aid and Cooperation Work Conference decided that secretaries and members of local Party committees at all levels should spend three months each year in rural areas, and county committee secretaries should spend about four months each year in rural areas, leading farmers in establishing cooperatives and personally participating in the work of establishing cooperatives, in order to gain experience and guide the overall situation. Local Party committees and county committees at all levels should regularly discuss the work of leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement and instruct relevant departments to regularly formulate plans to serve the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The conference emphasized the need to rely on rural branches to establish cooperatives and oppose the work style of cadres monopolizing and substituting for the masses. The Henan Provincial Mutual Aid and Cooperation Work Conference required Party committees at all levels to organize a systematic study of class policy within the Party in the near future to improve the policy level of cadres. Party committees at all levels should stipulate necessary and feasible systems to ensure the strengthening of leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Relevant rural work departments should better serve the cooperative movement. The Jiangxi Provincial Mutual Aid and Cooperation Work Conference also examined the achievements and shortcomings of Party committees at all levels below the prefectural level and rural Party branches in shifting their work focus to the mutual aid and cooperation movement over the past year. The conference also decided that all localities should immediately transfer more than 10,000 cadres to rural areas to promote the work of establishing cooperatives between now and the end of January next year.

Currently, there are more than 3,000 agricultural production cooperatives in rural Shaanxi Province. More than 21,000 new agricultural production cooperatives will be established next year. By that time, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives in the province can reach about 20 percent of the total number of peasant households, and the number of organized peasant households can reach 75 percent. Henan Province will establish 50,000 agricultural production cooperatives this winter and spring. Before the autumn harvest, there were only more than 6,000 cooperatives in the province. Now there are more than 22,000 cooperatives, which is almost half of the planned number of cooperatives to be established. Jiangxi Province has decided to develop agricultural production cooperatives to about 15,000 throughout the province from now until the end of January next year, and requires that the number of organized peasant households in the province reach 70 percent of the total number of peasant households next year.

In the rural areas of these three provinces, preparatory work for establishing cooperatives is being carried out closely in conjunction with production and unified purchase and sales work, while also taking into account the consolidation of newly established cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 10th: The Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sent three working groups in November to help three villages in Hulan, Zhaozhou, and Tangyuan counties, respectively, to formulate long-term plans for the development of agricultural production cooperatives and agricultural production plans for each village until 1957, in order to gain experience for promotion.

In the process of trial planning in the above three villages, the working groups helped the CCP branches in each village to analyze in detail the development of agricultural production cooperatives and the ideological situation of the peasants in their respective villages, and investigated the foundation and leadership backbone of the existing mutual aid teams in each village. The annual development plans for agricultural production cooperatives formulated by each village are generally practical. Similarly, the plans for developing agricultural production to 1957 formulated by each village based on the cooperative development plans, such as reclaiming wasteland, building small-scale water conservancy projects, expanding paddy fields, and adopting new technologies, all conform to the conditions of each village.

The peasants in these villages welcomed this approach of arranging long-term production development plans. Many peasants said, "This is a fundamental plan." Village cadres also felt that they had a clear idea and a clear direction for leadership.

    进一步贯彻党在农村工作中的阶级政策
    陕西、河南、江西积极稳步发展农业合作社
    中共黑龙江省委工作组帮助重点村制订长期建社计划
    据新华社讯：陕西、河南、江西三省正积极稳步地发展农业生产合作社。
    这三个省最近召开了互助合作工作会议，根据中共中央农村工作部召开的第四次互助合作工作会议的精神，检查了农村互助合作运动的情况，对今冬明春发展农业生产合作社的工作作了研究和布置。
    各省的互助合作工作会议都着重检查和研究了进一步贯彻党在农村工作中的阶级政策问题，并确定了党对互助合作运动的具体领导方法。陕西省的互助合作工作会议决定：各地党的地方委员会书记和委员每年要有三个月时间下乡，县委员会书记每年要有四个月左右时间下乡，领导农民办社并亲自参加办社工作，以便取得经验，指导全面。各地党的地方委员会和县委员会应定期讨论领导互助合作运动的工作，并责成有关部门定期制订为互助合作运动服务的计划。会议强调必须依靠农村支部办社和反对干部包办代替作风等。河南省的互助合作工作会议要求各级党委最近期间在党内组织一次系统的阶级政策的学习，以提高干部的政策水平。各级党委都要规定必要可行的制度，保证加强对于互助合作运动的领导。有关农村工作部门要更好地为合作化运动服务。江西省的互助合作工作会议并检查了地委以下各级党委和乡村党支部一年来将工作重心转向互助合作运动的成绩和缺点。会议还确定各地最近应即抽调一万名以上的干部下乡推动建社工作。
    现在，陕西省农村已有三千多个农业生产合作社，明年要新办二万一千多个农业生产合作社。那时，全省入社农户可达到总农户百分之二十上下，组织起来的农户可达百分之七十五。河南省今冬明春将建成五万个农业生产合作社。秋收前，全省只有六千多个社，现在已有两万二千多个社了，差不多已完成建社计划数字的一半。江西省决定从现在到明年一月底在全省把农业生产合作社发展到一万五千个左右，并要求明年全省组织起来的农户达到农户总数的百分之七十。
    这三个省的农村中正紧密结合生产和统购统销工作，进行建社的准备工作，同时兼顾新建社的巩固工作。
    据新华社哈尔滨十日电：中共黑龙江省委员会农村工作部在十一月间派出三个工作组，分别帮助呼兰、肇州、汤原三个县的三个村，制订了各村到一九五七年为止的发展农业生产合作社的长期计划和发展农业生产的计划，以便取得经验加以推广。
    在上述三个村试订计划的过程中，工作组帮助各村中共支部详细分析了本村农业生产合作社发展的情况和农民的思想情况，调查了各村现有互助组的基础和领导骨干等条件。各村所制订的农业生产合作社的逐年发展计划，一般是切合实际的。同样，各村根据合作社发展计划所订的到一九五七年的开荒、兴修小型水利、扩大水田、采用新技术等发展农业生产的计划，也都符合各村的条件。
    这些村中的农民，对这样安排长期发展生产计划的做法，都表示欢迎，许多农民说：“这是根本大计”。村干部也觉得这样心中有数了，领导的方向明确了。
