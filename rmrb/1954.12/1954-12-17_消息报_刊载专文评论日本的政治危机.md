Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 15th: The "News" published an article by an observer entitled "The Political Crisis in Japan."

The observer said that Yoshida's resignation has special significance because, in Japan, Yoshida's name is closely linked with the policy of making Japan subordinate to American command. For ordinary Japanese, Yoshida is the embodiment of Japan's status as a semi-occupied country. Yoshida's resignation is a manifestation of the deep political crisis in Japan, a crisis brought about by the policies of the ruling pro-American Liberal Party.

The observer said that when Yoshida traveled to the United States, he did so in the hope of propping up his shaky position. He had thought that Washington would give Japan a large amount of economic "aid" so that the ruling group could cope with economic difficulties, and thus be able to make the opposition in the Diet "speechless." But there was no result in this regard. As Japanese newspapers said, Yoshida and his colleagues "returned empty-handed from the United States." The result of this pilgrimage to Washington opened the eyes of many Japanese, making them realize that, after all, they cannot expect the United States to provide a large amount of economic "aid" because such "aid" is not listed in the plans of the American rulers at all. The so-called guarantee that the United States hopes to see Japan's economic "independence" is completely false.

Recent debates in the Diet have shown that all the members who spoke in the House of Representatives, regardless of which party they belonged to, saw that the main reason for the country's serious situation was the blind submission of Japanese policy to Washington's orders. These speeches show that more and more political leaders are soberly assessing the situation caused by the tyranny of the American occupiers. Even members of the ruling bourgeoisie are beginning to realize that Japan cannot obtain economic and political independence from the American monopolists who treat Japan as a semi-colony and must explore completely different ways to obtain this independence.

The observer continued, saying that those who support Yoshida's policies place great hope on the premise that the future of Japan's foreign trade supposedly lies in Southeast Asia. They came up with a formula: Japan's familiarity with local markets and technology plus American capital. But this formula has been shattered by the contradictions between Japan and Southeast Asian countries and the contradictions between Japan and the United States.

Mainly because the United States itself is interested in the Southeast Asian market, it is unwilling to use its own hands to strengthen the position of its competitor, Japan, there.

Only those who have lost confidence in Japan and the strength and potential of the Japanese people expect the United States to provide any substantial economic "aid" for the sake of a non-existent Japanese-American friendship. If Japan has become a semi-occupied country, can it expect any "selfless" American economic "aid"?

The observer pointed out that in Japan, there are fewer and fewer people willing to serve as cheap labor for American imperialism. Currently, people are seeking a way to develop a truly independent economy, to find a way out of the current situation. This approach lies in re-establishing normal economic and cultural relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other Asian countries. Democratic Party member Ito said in the Diet that the great significance of trade with China is very obvious to Japan. At the same time, there is a growing belief that restoring normal relations with the Soviet Union and People's China is necessary not only to expand foreign trade but also to strengthen the country's economic independence and ensure the independence of Japan's foreign policy.

The observer concluded that the developments related to Yoshida's resignation lead to the conclusion that the strong forces of the Japanese people are intensifying the struggle to liberate the country from foreign shackles. In this struggle, they receive the sympathy and support of all peace-loving forces who sincerely hope that Japan will become an independent, peaceful country. The peaceful and independent development of Japan is its contribution to defending peace and security in the Far East.

    “消息报”刊载专文评论日本的政治危机
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：“消息报”登载了观察家的一篇题为“日本的政治危机”的文章。
    观察家说，吉田的辞职具有特殊意义，因为在日本，吉田的名字是和使日本屈从于美国指挥的政策密切联系在一起的。对于普通的日本人来说，吉田是日本作为半被占领国的地位的化身。吉田的辞职是深刻的日本政治危机的表现，而这种危机是执政的亲美自由党的政策给这个国家带来的。
    观察家在谈到吉田到美国旅行时说，他作这次旅行是因为希望借此撑持他的动摇的地位。他曾以为华盛顿会给日本大量的经济“援助”，使这个统治集团能够应付经济困难，因此能够使国会中的反对派“无话可说”。但是在这方面毫无结果。正如日本报纸所说的，吉田和他的同僚“双手空空地从美国回来了”。到华盛顿去朝圣的这种结果打开了许多日本人的眼睛，使他们认识到：总而言之是不能期待美国进行大量的经济“援助”的，因为美国统治者们的计划中根本没有列上这种“援助”。所谓美国希望看到日本经济“独立”的这种保证完全是虚伪的。
    最近国会中的辩论显示，所有在众议院发言的议员，不管他们是属于那一党派，都看到造成这个国家的严重局势的主要原因是由于日本政策盲目屈从华盛顿的命令。这些发言说明，越来越多的政治领袖正在清醒地估计因美国占领者的虐政而造成的局势。即使执政的资产阶级人士也开始认识到：日本不能从那些把日本当作半殖民地的美国垄断资本家的手中获得经济和政治上的独立，必须探求完全不同的途径，来获得这种独立。
    观察家继续说，支持吉田政策的人们把很大希望寄托在这个前提上——日本对外贸易的前途据说在于东南亚。他们得出一个公式：日本对当地市场的熟悉和技术加上美国的资本。但是这个公式已由于日本和东南亚国家间的矛盾及日本和美国间的矛盾而被粉碎了。
    主要是由于美国本身对东南亚市场感到兴趣，它不愿用自己的手来加强它的竞争者——日本在那边的地位。
    只有那些对日本和日本人民的力量和潜在力失去信心的人，才期望美国为了根本不存在的日美友谊而给予任何大量的经济“援助”。如果日本已经成为一个半被占领国，它能够期望任何“无私的”美国经济“援助”吗？
    观察家指出，在日本，愿意为美帝国主义的廉价劳动服务的人越来越少了。目前人们正在寻求发展真正独立的经济的方针，从现状中寻找一条出路。这种方针在于同苏联、中华人民共和国和其他亚洲国家重新建立正常的经济和文化关系。民主党议员伊藤在国会中说，对日本来说，同中国进行贸易的重大意义是十分明显的。同时，人们越来越相信，恢复同苏联和人民中国的正常关系所以必要，不仅是为扩大对外贸易，而且是为加强这个国家的经济的独立，保证日本外交政策的独立。
    观察家总结说，和吉田辞职有关的事态的发展，使人们得到这样的结论：强健的日本人民的力量，正在加紧进行争取这个国家从外国桎梏下解放的斗争。在这个斗争中，他们得到诚心希望日本成为一个独立、和平的国家的所有爱好和平的力量的同情和支持。日本的和平和独立的发展，就是它对保卫远东和平和安全的贡献。
