To Comrade Fadeyev of the Soviet Writers' Union, Moscow, to be forwarded to the Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers:

    The Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers, which the Chinese literary circles have been eagerly anticipating, has opened. On this meaningful day, please accept the warmest congratulations from the Chinese writers! For more than thirty years, under the illumination of Marxism-Leninism, Soviet literature has created incomparably brilliant achievements along the great historical road from socialism to communism, enriching the cultural treasury of mankind. Soviet literature has become the most advanced and vibrant literature of mankind, a powerful tool for conducting communist ideological education to the broad masses of people all over the world, and a significant force in defending world peace and striving for people's democracy. Especially for the Chinese people, the profound influence of Soviet literature is unparalleled! It is not only the most precious learning model for Chinese writers, but also a good teacher and helpful friend to the Chinese people, and a great force inspiring the Chinese people in the process of building a socialist society! Soviet writers, thanks to your unremitting efforts, Soviet literature has become the core of leading the progressive literary movement in the world! We believe that this congress, in discussing how Soviet literature can use its great communist ideology and artistic power to help the Soviet Communist Party and the government in building communism, and in developing the theory and creation of socialist realism literature, will have an extremely important impact on the progressive cultural movement in the world. We eagerly await and sincerely wish the congress a victorious success!

    Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Mao Dun
