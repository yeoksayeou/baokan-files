I sold 2,500 jin of surplus grain to the state last year. The villagers selected me as a model, and the People's Government issued me a certificate of merit as a patriotic grain seller. When the surplus grain sales started this year, I thought to myself: since I was a model grain seller last year, I can't fall behind this year. After the mass meeting, during the discussion, I truthfully reported the amount of surplus grain, peanuts, and cotton on the spot. Unexpectedly, when I mentioned it at home, problems arose. My parents said, "If you sell that much grain, will there be enough left to eat?" My wife and eldest daughter also complained, "You reported too much surplus grain again!" Some backward people in the village even said I was "showing off." These words really confused me. I asked myself, "Could it be that I'm doing something wrong?"

Puzzled by this, I tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. I remembered the bitter life of the past: from the age of seven, I went to the fields to gather firewood. Until liberation, I never had a good day. Our family of ten relied on only a few acres of land. We worked ourselves to the bone but still struggled to eat and clothe ourselves. We were often hungry. When the Japanese devils came here, they robbed us of everything. Once, I was captured by the Japanese devils, tortured half to death, and forced to leave my family behind. My whole family had to beg for food. Thinking of this, I couldn't help but shed tears.

Getting out of bed, I looked at the present. On the warm kang, my seventy-year-old mother was still healthy. My wife was good at managing the household. My eldest daughter's husband had joined the People's Liberation Army. My second daughter was a strong worker. My third daughter was in the fourth grade of junior primary school. My fourth daughter was a Young Pioneer. My fifth daughter was sleeping soundly. Looking at the photo of my son Shou Shan and his wife with their grandson, I thought of him working in the state-owned copper and lead mine and their happy life. Looking up, I saw the portrait of Chairman Mao and last year's patriotic grain selling award hanging on the west wall... I smiled. I knew that I should take the lead in selling surplus grain.

The next day, I called my family together and held a grain selling discussion. I asked everyone to think about the past, look at the present, and discuss whether we should sell surplus grain. Everyone spoke in turn, talking about the bitter times of the past. My wife, Gu Shiqin, said, "That year, the Japanese devils robbed us of everything. Our whole family was starving without a single grain of rice. In the twelfth lunar month, we went out begging for food in snow more than a foot deep. We were so hungry that we felt dizzy..." Her words brought tears to everyone's eyes. My mother said, "The suffering of the past is endless." I said, "Those who have tasted gentian know how difficult suffering is. The compatriots in Taiwan are still suffering from the burning, killing, and looting of the American aggressors and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Can we keep our surplus grain and not sell it to support the liberation of Taiwan? Some areas have suffered disasters this year. Can we not support our disaster-stricken compatriots?"

Then we calculated the accounts: the four mu and nine fen of "Golden Queen" corn in the west of the village yielded an average of 560 jin per mu. The harvest of other crops was also good. Everyone said that, firstly, we participated in the mutual aid team, and the whole family put in their strength, plowing the fields one more time and weeding twice as much. Secondly, we used the money from selling surplus grain last year to buy an ox and a donkey, 320 jin of fertilizer, and 100 jin of chemical fertilizer calcium sulfate, which increased the fertility of the land. My wife said, "Fertilizer and calcium sulfate are really powerful. If we hadn't applied this chemical fertilizer, we wouldn't have been able to harvest so well." I said, "Not only are fertilizer and calcium sulfate good, but tractors are even better. If we want to use these good things more often, we must do a good job in production and sell more surplus grain to support the country's construction. The more big factories there are, the more of these things can be produced. Only then can we live a good life like the Soviet people in the future."

At this point, my mother, Shiqin, eldest daughter, and second daughter all understood. They said, "Let's plan carefully and keep just enough grain to eat. This winter and next spring, we'll eat more sweet potatoes. We need to be mindful when cooking and not waste grain. Eat what's left over from the previous meal in the next one. Save two jin of grain per person per month. Try not to use grain for feeding pigs and livestock. We must collect substitutes for food."

In this way, our family sold 2,383.5 jin of surplus grain and also sold 1,100 jin of peanuts and 25 jin of cotton to the state. We didn't waste the money from selling the grain. We deposited 1.5 million yuan in the state bank, preparing to buy means of production next year to increase production.

    我家开了个卖粮座谈会
    河北省丰润县郑庄子村爱国售粮模范　李显宗
    我去年卖了两千五百斤余粮给国家，村里乡亲们选我当了模范，人民政府发给我爱国售粮模范奖状。今年开始卖余粮时，我心里就想：去年当了售粮模范，今年也不能落到后边。开过了群众会，在讨论时，当场我就报实了余粮、花生和棉花。不料想回家一说，倒出了问题啦。爹娘说：“你卖那些粮食，剩的还够吃呀？”我妻子和大闺女也埋怨说：“又是你报的余粮多！”村里也有个别落后人说我是“出风头”。这些话，真把我闹糊涂了。自己问自己：“莫非说这是做错了吗？”
    为这事纳闷，躺在炕上翻来覆去睡不着，又想起了过去的苦光景：从打七岁下地拾柴，一直到解放前，没有过上一天好日子。全家十来口人，只有几亩地，累死累活地干也顾不上吃穿，常常是饱一顿饿一顿的。日本鬼子到这里，抢的啥也没了。一次，我被日本鬼子抓去，拷打了个半死，被迫扔下一家老小离开家，全家只得讨饭吃。想到这里，我禁不住流出泪来。
    下了炕，我看了看现在，热乎乎的炕头上，七十多岁的老娘还很健康，妻子很会过日子，大闺女的丈夫参加了人民解放军，二闺女劳动强，三闺女上初小四年级，四闺女是少年先锋队员，五闺女睡的正香甜。望着我儿子守山夫妇俩和小孙孙的合影，想到了他在国营的铜铅矿工作的情景和他们的幸福生活。抬起头来，看到了西山墙挂的毛主席像和去年的爱国售粮奖状……我笑了，我知道了自己应该带头卖余粮。
    第二天我把一家人叫在一起，开了卖粮座谈会，让大伙想想过去，看看现在，讨论一下是不是应该卖余粮。你一言我一语地说起了过去的苦时光。我妻谷士芹说：“那年，被日本鬼子抢的啥也没了，一家老小饿着没有一粒粮，腊月天，踏着一尺多深的雪出去要饭，饿的眼黑心慌……。”她这一说，引的一家人眼泪汪汪的。老娘说：“过去的苦处说不完。”我说：“吃过黄连的知道苦难受。台湾的同胞，现在还受着美国侵略者、蒋介石卖国贼的烧杀抢掠，咱能放着余粮不卖，不支援解放台湾吗？今年有的地方遭了灾，咱能不支持灾区同胞吗？”
    接着算了下账：村西四亩九分“金皇后”玉米，平均每亩收五百六十斤，别的庄稼收成也不坏。大家说，一来是参加了互助组，全家卖了力气，多耘了一遍地，多拔了两遍草；二来是用去年卖余粮的钱，买了一牛一驴，买了三百二十斤肥田粉，一百斤化学肥料硫酸钙，增加了地力。我妻说：“肥田粉、硫酸钙就是力量大，要不施这个化学肥料，咱的庄稼收不了这样好。”我说：“不光肥田粉、硫酸钙好，拖拉机更好。要想多用这些好东西，就得搞好生产，多卖余粮，支援国家的建设。大工厂多了，才能多造这些东西。将来才能过上像苏联人民那样的好生活。”
    说到这里，老娘、士芹、大闺女、二闺女都想通了，她们说：“咱盘算盘算，留的粮食够吃的就行。今年冬天明年春天，多吃些白薯，做饭要心里有底，别糟塌粮食，上顿剩的下顿随上吃。每人每月节省二斤粮。喂猪、喂牲口尽量不用粮食，要采集代食品。”
    我家就这样卖了两千三百八十三斤半余粮，把一千一百斤花生和二十五斤棉花也卖给了国家。卖粮的钱没乱花，存到国家银行一百五十万元，准备明年买生产资料，好增产。
