    Yuanyang County Begins Constructing a Protective Forest Network
    In order to change the appearance of the sandy area in the old course of the Yellow River, Yuanyang County, Henan Province, is learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in constructing protective forest belts, and in light of the specific local conditions, has formulated a county-wide protective forest network construction plan. The plan calls for the creation of 73 main forest belts and 47 secondary forest belts on seven-tenths of the county's cultivated land, planting 5,346,216 trees. The plan will be implemented in batches and phases, and is expected to be completed within the next three years. After the completion of this plan to transform nature, within ten years, it can produce 10,780,000 pieces of timber seven feet long that can be used as wooden mine pillars, and also expand the cultivated land area by 55,000 mu, improve the soil of 689,500 mu of land within the forest network, and increase agricultural production. In order to complete this plan, Yuanyang County has decided to build 48 main forest belts and 30 secondary forest belts on 450,000 mu of cultivated land this winter, planting 2,521,800 trees. The county afforestation headquarters, headed by the Secretary of the Yuanyang County Party Committee and the County Head, has been established, and 50 cadres have been transferred to go deep into the districts and townships to organize the masses to carry out this work.

    改变黄河故道沙区面貌
    原阳县开始营造防护林网
    为改变黄河故道的沙区面貌，河南省原阳县学习苏联营造防护林带的先进经验，结合本地具体情况，制订了全县的营造防护林网计划。计划中要求在全县十分之七的耕地面积上营造主要林带七十三道、副林带四十七道，植树五百三十四万六千二百
  一十六株。计划将分批分期进行，预计在今后三年内完成。这一改造自然的计划完成后，在十年之内，可生产七尺长的能作煤矿木柱用的木材一千零七十八万根，还可扩大耕地面积五万五千亩，改良林网内六十八万九千五百亩地的土壤，增加农业生产。为完成这一计划，原阳县已决定今冬在四十五万亩的耕地面积上营造主林带四十八道、副林带三十道，植树二百五十二万一千八百株。以中共原阳县委书记、县长为首的县造林指挥部已成立，并抽调干部五十人深入区、乡组织群众开展这一工作。
