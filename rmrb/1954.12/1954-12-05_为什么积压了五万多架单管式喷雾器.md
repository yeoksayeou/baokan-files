To the Editors:

    The issue of the more than fifty thousand single-tube sprayers piling up in Henan Province needs to be resolved quickly.

    Most of these sprayers were purchased by the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry in 1952 using state loans, with the remainder being operated independently by the Henan Provincial Cooperatives. Due to the inconvenience of operation and the failure to supply pesticides in a timely manner, it has been extremely difficult to promote these sprayers. These devices are stored in the warehouses of agricultural and forestry departments and the warehouses of cooperatives, and have been left unattended for a long time. For example, the 7,000 sprayers stored in the Kaifeng Agricultural Experiment Station occupy the entire area of ​​three warehouses; the 9,000 sprayers stored in the Xuchang Agricultural Technology Guidance Station almost occupy the entire warehouse, seriously affecting the daily work of these units.

    As for the portion that has already been sold, some farmers dismantled the copper tubes and used them as smoking pipes, while others gave the rubber tubes to children as toys; those that have not been opened are still lying under the beds of district and township cadres.

    The leading organs are aware of these situations, and they have held several meetings to study this issue, but they always thought that this was a "mess," so they postponed it indefinitely. Now, in addition to the bank loan being unpayable, the interest alone amounts to 7.6 billion yuan. Delay is not a good solution, it will only cause greater losses to the state. Therefore, I am reporting this issue to you, hoping to urge the relevant departments to properly resolve it.

    Investigation and Opinions of the Readers' Letters Group of This Newspaper

    The issue reflected by Comrade Chen Dianren that the agricultural and forestry departments and cooperatives in Henan Province have been piling up a large number of sprayers for a long time has been confirmed by this newspaper's investigation as factual. The main reasons for the pileup are: the Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry's formulation of purchase plans was too blind and did not correspond to the actual needs of farmers; at the same time, it failed to effectively solve a series of problems such as technical guidance, parts repair and pesticide supply, coupled with excessively high prices and poor quality (especially some of the low-quality sprayers produced in Henan Province itself), the masses were unwilling to buy them. This year, farmers in Henan Province have used a large amount of "666" powder to kill insects with good results, so the promotion of sprayers has become even more difficult.

    In order to solve the long-term accumulation of state assets and make these sprayers as beneficial as possible to agricultural production, a way out must be found. This year, grain and cotton producing areas in Henan Province have widely adopted "666" powder for pest control, reducing the need for single-tube sprayers; however, pest control work in fruit tree planting areas such as the Neihuang and Xinzheng jujube areas, Linxian persimmon areas, and vegetable planting areas in urban suburbs has not yet been basically developed, and the number of sprayers required is large. If technical guidance work is established in a planned way in these areas, repair and maintenance institutions are set up, and the supply of medicines is well done, making it convenient for farmers to adopt them, then the promotion of sprayers can be solved. If it is impossible to sell all of them, you can also apply to the central government to consider transferring them to rice-growing areas for use.

    Of course, when dealing with this batch of sprayers, a cleaning work must be done. Those that cannot be used due to poor quality should not be pushed out casually; for waste products that have been sold or loaned out in the past, they should also be recovered and scrapped in accordance with the spirit of the "Instructions on Several Issues in Clearing Agricultural Loans" issued by the former Government Administration Council on January 7, 1954, and interest should be waived.

    The responsible comrades of the Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Provincial Finance and Economics Commission have two preliminary opinions on the handling of this batch of sprayers: first, to give this batch of sprayers accumulated in the hands of the state and cooperatives to agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams free of charge, the starting point being that giving them to farmers will always have some effect; second, to sell them to farmers at a low price of 50,000 yuan per unit (note: the original price was 315,000 yuan per unit), meaning to solve the "accumulation" problem by means of price reduction. Neither of these methods takes into account the benefit of agricultural production and the handling of capital accumulation, and is therefore wrong. Because after this batch of sprayers has been sorted out, if the specifications and quality are not much different from those currently sold on the market, and they are given to farmers free of charge or sold at a reduced price of 50,000 yuan, the result will be that speculators will buy them in large quantities, and then dismantle the parts for sale to obtain profits. At the same time, this is bound to affect the state's future price policy for the promotion of agricultural machinery. Moreover, without solving technical guidance, parts repair and pesticide supply, it is only changing from being accumulated in the hands of the state to being distributed to the hands of farmers.

    According to our understanding, Hebei, Shaanxi and other provinces have also accumulated a large number of single-tube sprayers. Local agricultural and forestry and cooperative departments should pay attention to solving this problem so as not to cause losses to state property.

### 为什么积压了五万多架单管式喷雾器

    为什么积压了五万多架单管式喷雾器编辑同志：
    河南省积压五万多架单管式喷雾器的事情需要迅速解决。
    这批喷雾器，大部分是河南省农林厅利用国家贷款，在一九五二年购制的，其余是河南省合作社自行经营的。这批喷雾器由于操作不便，农药又不得及时供应，所以推销极为困难。这些器械分别存放在农林部门的仓库和合作社的货栈里，长期无人过问。例如，存放在开封农业试验场的七千架喷雾器，占用了三个库房的全部面积；许昌农业技术指导站存放的九千架，几乎占用了全部仓库，严重地影响了这些单位的日常工作。
    至于已经推销出去的一部分，有些农民把铜管拆卸下来当烟杆用，把橡皮管给儿童们当玩具；没有开箱的还躺在区、乡干部床铺底下。
    领导机关是知道这些情况的，他们也曾经几次开会研究这个问题，但总以为这是个“烂摊子”，因而无限期地拖延了下来。现在，除银行贷款无法归还外，仅利息一项即达七十六亿元。拖延绝不是好办法，这只会造成国家更大的损失。因此，我向你们反映这个问题，希望督促有关部门妥善解决。

    本报读者来信组的调查和意见
    陈典仁同志反映河南省农林部门、合作社长期积压大批喷雾器的问题，经本报派人调查确系事实。造成积压的原因主要是：河南省人民政府农林厅制订采购计划的盲目性太大，同农民的实际需要不相适应；同时，又未能有效地解决技术指导、零件修配和药剂供应等一系列的问题，加上价格过高，质量又差（特别是河南省自制的一部分质量低劣），群众不愿购买。今年河南省农民大量使用“六六六”粉剂灭虫，效果良好，因此喷雾器的推销就更加困难。
    为了解决国家资财的长期积压，并使这批喷雾器尽量有益于农业生产，必须设法找寻一条出路。今年河南省的粮食、棉花产区大量采用“六六六”粉剂灭虫，对单管式喷雾器的需要减少了；但在内黄、新郑枣区、林县柿区等栽种果树和城市郊区栽种蔬菜地区的虫害防治工作，目前基本没有展开，需用喷雾器的数量很大。如果在这些地区有计划地建立技术指导工作、设立修配机构和做好药剂的供应工作，便于农民采用，那么喷雾器的推销，是可以求得解决的。如果无法全部销出，还可以向中央申请，考虑外调给水稻地区使用。
    当然在处理这批喷雾器时，必须做一次清理工作，凡是因质量太坏不能使用的，不应该随便推出去；对于过去销出或贷出的废品，也应该根据前政务院一九五四年一月七日发布的“关于清理农业贷款中若干问题的指示”的精神收回报废，并免收利息。
    河南省人民政府农林厅和省财政经济委员会负责同志对这批喷雾器的处理有两种初步意见：第一，把积压在国家和合作社手中的这批喷雾器，无偿地送给农业生产合作社和互助组，出发点是送给农民总能发挥一些作用；第二，用每架五万元的低价卖给农民（按：原价每部为三十一万五千元），意思是用降价办法来解决“积压”问题。这两种办法都不是从有利于农业生产和处理资金积压着眼的，因而是错误的。因为这批喷雾器经过整理以后，如果规格、质量同当前市上出售的相差不多，而无偿地送给农民或降低到五万元出售，结果将会使投机商人大量套购，然后拆卸零件出售以取得利润。同时，这也必然要影响国家今后对农业器械推广的价格政策。而且不解决技术指导、零件修配和药剂供应，也只是从积压在国家手中，变成分散到农民手中。
    据我们了解，河北、陕西等省也积压了大批单管式喷雾器。当地农林、合作部门应该注意解决这个问题，以免国家财产受到损失。
