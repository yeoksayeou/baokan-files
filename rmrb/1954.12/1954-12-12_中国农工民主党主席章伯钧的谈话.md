    The statement by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai regarding the US-Chiang "Joint Defense Treaty" once again expresses the firm will of our 600 million people to resolutely liberate Taiwan, oppose American aggression, and safeguard peace in Asia and the world. I, on behalf of all members of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, express our firm support.
    The US-Chiang "Joint Defense Treaty" is an aggressive treaty by which the US government blatantly occupies our territory, infringes upon our sovereignty, and interferes in our internal affairs. The American aggressive bloc and its followers call it a defensive treaty, which is pure sophistry and nonsense. Our long-tested people will never tolerate the United States occupying our territory of Taiwan and Penghu under the false pretense of defense.
    The US government is determined to be hostile to our 600 million people and has even signed a "Joint Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, legalizing the armed occupation of Taiwan. This is unanimously opposed by the people of the world. Chiang Kai-shek is a public enemy of the Chinese people and has long been abandoned by the people of the whole country. He has no qualification to sign any treaty with any country. The US-Chiang "Joint Defense Treaty" is fundamentally illegal and invalid. The US government's blatant actions cannot shake the determination of our people to liberate Taiwan, but only increase the resentment of the people of the whole country. The Chinese people love peace, but will never sacrifice sovereignty and territory to beg for peace. The Chinese people resolutely oppose war, but will never be intimidated by threats of war. The strength of the Chinese people is powerful, and our unity is solid. Whoever dares to attack us will be met with a bloody nose.
    The public enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, has always sold out the country for personal gain. During the twenty-plus years of his bloody rule over China, he was licentious, cruel, and did everything to harm the country and the people. He plundered countless amounts of people's blood and sweat and massacred countless revolutionary martyrs. We will forever hate him and never forget. Now, he occupies our territory of Taiwan and willingly sells out our sovereignty and territory, turning Taiwan into the 49th state of the United States. This is absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country. Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of murder and betrayal of the country cannot escape the people's justice. The blood debts of the people's revolution must be repaid in blood. All members of our party should, together with the people of the whole country, take practical actions to avenge the people, and carry the struggle to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to the end, never stopping until our goal is achieved.

### 中国农工民主党主席章伯钧的谈话

    中国农工民主党主席章伯钧的谈话
    周恩来总理兼外交部长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，再一次表达了我国六亿人民坚决解放台湾，反对美国侵略，保卫亚洲及世界和平的坚强意志。我代表中国农工民主党全体党员表示坚决拥护和支持。
    美蒋“共同防御条约”，是美国政府明目张胆地霸占我国领土，侵犯我国主权，干涉我国内政的侵略性的条约。而美国侵略集团及其追随者竟称为防御性的条约，这完全是诡辩胡说。久经锻炼的我国人民，决不会容忍美国在谎言的防御名义下侵占我国领土台湾和澎湖。
    美国政府决心与我国六亿人民为敌，竟和蒋贼签订“共同防御条约”，把武装侵占台湾的行为成为合法化，这是全世界人民一致反对的。蒋贼是中国人民的公敌，早已为全国人民所共弃，它没有同任何国家签订任何条约的资格，美蒋“共同防御条约”，根本是非法的、无效的。美国政府悍然这样作，丝毫不能动摇我国人民解放台湾的决心，只有增加全国人民的愤恨。中国人民热爱和平，但决不牺牲主权国土来乞求和平。中国人民坚决反对战争，但决不被战争威胁吓倒。中国人民的力量是强大的，团结是坚固的。谁要敢来进攻，谁就要碰得头破血流。
    人民公敌蒋介石，一贯卖国求荣。在他血腥统治中国的二十多年中间，荒淫、残忍、做尽了祸国殃民坏事，搜刮无数人民血汗，屠杀无数革命志士，是我们永远切齿痛恨不能忘记的。现在，他窃据国土台湾，甘心出卖主权领土，把台湾变为美国第四十九州，这是我们全国人民万万不能容忍的。蒋贼的杀人卖国罪行，决不能逃出人民的法网，人民革命的血债，是要用血来还的。我党全体党员应与全国人民一道，以实际行动为人民雪恨，把解放台湾消灭蒋贼的斗争进行到底，不达目的，决不罢休。　（新华社）
