Dear Comrade Li Xiannian and Comrades of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China:

    The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party was very pleased to receive your letter and learned that the Chinese people are presenting our people with the following gifts on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Albania's liberation:

    20,000 tons of wheat, 2,000 tons of rice, 2,000 tons of sugar, 100,000 meters of silk fabric, 200 tons of hemp rope, 100 tons of porcelain enamel, and 40 tons of tin.

    We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to you on behalf of the Albanian Labor Party, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and all the Albanian people for your generous gift. Your gift warmly demonstrates the fraternal affection and close friendship that unites the small Albanian people and the 600 million Chinese people. The gifts from the Chinese people to the Albanian people are an important contribution to our Party and our government to further improve the lives of our working people.

    The Albanian people, who are fighting with all their strength to lay the foundations of socialism, believe that the assistance and support of the great Chinese people, like the assistance given by the glorious Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, are indispensable factors for the victory of socialism in our country.

    The friendly relations between the People's Republic of Albania and the People's Republic of China have recently developed greatly. The Albanian Labor Party and the Government of the People's Republic of Albania will strive to continue to develop these relations and to further enhance and consolidate the friendship between our people and the fraternal Chinese people. The friendship between our two peoples is invincible because it is based on the friendship of our common friend, the glorious standard-bearer of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism—the Soviet Union.

    Dear Comrades, I once again ask you to convey our most sincere gratitude for the precious gifts given to our people to the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Chairman of the People's Republic of China - dear Comrade Mao Zedong, and all the Chinese people.

    We wish the fraternal Chinese people ever greater achievements in the struggle to build a strong and prosperous People's Republic of China.

    Long live the friendship between the Albanian people and the great Chinese people!

            First Secretary Enver Hoxha
            Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party
            December 1, 1954
