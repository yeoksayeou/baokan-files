Both Banks of the Songhua River

The Songhua River originates in the Changbai Mountains, flows through Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, and is 1,900 kilometers long. Both banks are rich in products and beautiful scenery.

The mountainous area of the upper reaches of the Songhua River has continuous primeval forests and abundant mineral resources, as well as valuable medicinal materials and animal furs. The great plains along both banks of the middle reaches of the Songhua River are rich in sorghum, millet, rice, and wheat, and are also an important soybean producing area in China.

The water of the Songhua River is not only suitable for navigation, but also becomes the source of power for the country's socialist industrialization - electricity. In addition, Songhua Lake is also rich in fresh fish; the sand and gravel along the Songhua River have become important materials for capital construction since the start of large-scale economic construction.

A large amount of electricity generated by the water of the Songhua River is continuously sent to various places to meet the needs of industrial production, construction and people's lives.

There is beautiful scenery everywhere along the Songhua River. During holidays, many people come to the river to stroll or row on the river. This is the Songhua River near Harbin, with Sun Island in the distance. Harbin Federation of Trade Unions Shang Shunian photo

    松花江两岸
    松花江发源于长白山，流经吉林、黑龙江省，全长一千九百公里，两岸物产丰富，风景美丽。
    松花江上游山地，有连绵不断的原始森林，矿藏也很丰富，还有名贵药材、兽皮。松花江中游沿江两岸的大平原，盛产高粱、小米、水稻、小麦，也是我国大豆的重要产地。
    松花江水，不仅适于航运，并且成为国家社会主义工业化的动力——电力的源泉。此外，松花湖还盛产鲜鱼；松花江沿岸的砂石，在大规模经济建设开始以后，已成为基本建设的重要材料。
