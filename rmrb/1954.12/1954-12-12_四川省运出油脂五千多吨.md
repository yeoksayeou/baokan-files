    Sichuan Province Ships Out Over 5,000 Tons of Oil
    The Sichuan Provincial State-Run Oil Company shipped a total of more than 5,100 tons of tung oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, and other oils to Shanghai and the Northeast in October and November. This year, Sichuan Province has actively explored new oil sources, increasing oil production. The amount of edible oil extracted from peanuts in the province this year has increased by more than 7,000 tons compared to last year. In the past, peanuts in Sichuan were not used for oil extraction on a large scale.

    四川省运出油脂五千多吨
    四川省国营油脂公司在十、十一两个月运往上海和东北等地的桐油、花生油、菜油和其他油脂共五千一百多吨。今年四川省积极开辟新油源，油脂产量增加。全省今年用花生榨的食油就比去年增加七千多吨，过去四川的花生是不大量用于榨油的。
