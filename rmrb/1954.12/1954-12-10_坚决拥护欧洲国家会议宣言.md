People's Assembly of the German Democratic Republic
    The People's Assembly of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting on the 8th. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution agreeing with the position and statements of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic at the European conference guaranteeing European peace and security; supporting the declaration of the Moscow European conference, approving the signature of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic on this declaration; and authorizing the government to formulate all the measures stipulated in the declaration.
    Prime Minister Grotewohl, head of the delegation attending the Moscow European conference, and Deputy Prime Minister Ulbricht, a member of the delegation, reported to the meeting.
    Grotewohl pointed out that the German people will never recognize the Paris Agreement, which violates their interests. He called on all German patriots to unite and fight against the Paris Agreement, strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the peaceful and democratic unification of Germany, and support various measures to protect the German Democratic Republic, which also guarantees peace.
    Ulbricht pointed out in his speech that ratifying the Paris Agreement would make it impossible to restore Germany's unity peacefully. Only the establishment of a collective security system can ease international tensions and peacefully resolve the German question. All democratic and peaceful forces in the German people must take concerted action in the struggle against the Paris Agreement and against the revival of German militarism. Ulbricht emphasized that once the Paris Agreement is ratified, the German Democratic Republic will have to take corresponding measures to establish armed forces.
    Representatives of all parties who spoke at the meeting expressed their full support for the declaration of the European conference.

Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany
    The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) held its 22nd plenary session in Berlin on the 7th to discuss the results of the European conference guaranteeing European peace and security. Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the SED, made a report on the course and results of the European conference.
    The plenary session unanimously adopted Ulbricht's report and passed a resolution agreeing with the statement of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic at the European conference and the declaration signed by the participating countries.
    The plenary session also decided to take all possible measures to implement the tasks indicated in the declaration of the European conference.

Council of Ministers of Poland
    The Council of Ministers of the Polish People's Republic held a meeting on the 6th and listened to a report by the head of the Polish delegation to the Moscow European conference guaranteeing European peace and security, Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz, on the course and results of the Moscow conference.
    The Council of Ministers approved the report of the Polish government delegation attending the conference.

Mass Rally in Warsaw
    The Warsaw Committee of the Polish National Front held a mass rally at the Warsaw Sports Palace on the 7th to support the declaration of the Moscow European conference and oppose the rearmament of West Germany. More than 4,000 people from all parties, government, army, and various circles in Poland, as well as citizens of Warsaw, attended the rally. Frachon, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor, and Vittorio, President of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, who came to Warsaw to attend the World Federation of Trade Unions conference, also attended the rally.
    Cyrankiewicz, head of the Polish government delegation attending the European conference and Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers, made a report to the conference. He said that the Polish people fully support the Moscow conference. He recounted the great disasters suffered by the Polish people in the World Wars, and pointed out: "Today's Poland is no longer the weak, isolated, and backward Poland of the past. With us are the Soviet Union and the 900 million people of the people's democracies."
    The conference unanimously passed a resolution expressing its support for the European conference and its declaration.

Hungarian Delegation to the European Conference
    Hegeds, First Deputy Chairman of the Hungarian Council of Ministers and head of the Hungarian delegation attending the European conference, delivered a radio address in Budapest on the 7th. He said that the Moscow conference was one of the most significant events in international life since World War II. The Soviet Union and the people's democracies cannot sit idly by and watch the revival of West German militarism.
    Hegeds emphasized that the countries participating in the Moscow conference unanimously declared that if the Western countries want to take the road of reviving West German militarism, they will take joint measures to safeguard the security of their people and countries. This statement gave strength to the Hungarian people.
    Hegeds said that the goal of Hungary's foreign policy is to establish good and peaceful relations with all countries. Recently, relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia have improved. We sincerely hope that for the benefit of the two peoples and for the maintenance of lasting peace, the friendship and cooperation between the Hungarian and Yugoslav peoples will continue to develop, because the revival of the German "Wehrmacht" also threatens Yugoslavia.
    Hegeds finally pointed out that the Hungarian people are now unprecedentedly united and have established friendly relations with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. The Hungarian people want to serve the cause of peace and the great cause of progress for all mankind.

Bulgarian Delegation to the European Conference
    The Bulgarian delegation attending the Moscow European conference guaranteeing European peace and security held a press conference on the 8th. Yugov, Deputy Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers and head of the delegation, made a statement.
    In his statement, Yugov specifically pointed out that the Bulgarian people unanimously support the declaration of the Moscow conference. Bulgaria is ready to participate in the European collective security organization and contribute its strength in taking all joint measures to safeguard the peace and security of our peoples.
    Yugov said that the Bulgarian people regard the continuous improvement of their material and cultural standards as their main task. Therefore, they advocate peace and security, and advocate maintaining good-neighborly relations and peaceful cooperation with the people of the Balkan countries and the people of other European countries. The Bulgarian people have never had such a strong international fortress as they have now. They are watching the future with more confidence than ever before, and they are ready to dedicate all their strength to the cause of peace, to defend their peaceful life, and to defend their progress along the socialist road.

    乌布利希在发言中指出：批准巴黎协定就会使得和平恢复德国的统一成为不可能。只有建立集体安全体系，才能缓和国际紧张局势，才能和平解决德国问题。德国人民中的一切民主、和平力量在反对巴黎协定、反对复活德国军国主义的斗争中必须采取一致行动。乌布利希着重指出：一旦巴黎协定被批准，德意志民主共和国就不得不采取相应的措施来建立武装力量。
    在会上发言的各党代表都表示完全支持欧洲会议的宣言。
