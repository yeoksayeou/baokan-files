Hubei Province's handicraft cooperative organizations have seen new developments in the second half of this year. At the end of June, the province had 247 handicraft production cooperatives and 1,221 handicraft production teams. According to incomplete statistics from mid-November, the province has newly established 87 handicraft production cooperatives and a number of production teams, with another 126 handicraft production cooperatives currently being prepared for establishment.

After the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a handicraft work conference in early September, various regions began to develop handicraft cooperative organizations in a planned manner. Many regions trained key personnel for establishing handicraft cooperative organizations. In Xiangyang Prefecture alone, Zhaoyang, Guanghua, and four other counties, along with Xiangfan City, trained more than 520 key personnel. Party committees, governments, and relevant departments in many regions organized work teams for establishing cooperatives, delving into key areas to lead the establishment of cooperatives in batches. In the process of establishing cooperatives, they generally started with summarizing production, conducting cooperative education to further enhance the socialist consciousness of handicraftsmen; then organizing the study of the articles of association of handicraft production cooperatives, implementing the principles of voluntariness, mutual benefit, and democracy; and finally establishing leadership organizations, formulating systems, and applying for approval. Through this stage of work, various regions have gained some experience in establishing handicraft cooperative organizations. It is expected that by next spring, the province will have developed more than 820 handicraft production cooperatives and 2,000 handicraft production teams. (Teng Chunfeng)

    湖北省手工业合作组织有发展
    湖北省手工业合作组织今年下半年有了新的发展。六月底，全省有二百四十七个手工业生产合作社、一千二百二十一个手工业生产小组。据十一月中旬的不完全统计，全省又新建立了八十七个手工业生产合作社和一批生产小组，正在筹备建立的手工业生产合作社还有一百二十六个。
    九月初，中共湖北省委召开手工业工作会议以后，各地有计划地展开发展手工业合作组织的工作。许多地区训练了建立手工业合作组织的骨干。仅襄阳专区的枣阳、光化等六县和襄樊市就训练骨干五百二十多名。许多地区的党委、政府及有关部门组织了建社工作组，深入重点，领导分批建社。在建社过程中，一般都首先从总结生产入手，进行合作化的教育，进一步提高手工业者的社会主义觉悟；然后组织学习手工业生产合作社的章程，贯彻自愿、互利、民主的原则；最后建立领导机构，订立制度，申请批准。通过这一阶段的工作，各地取得了一些建立手工业合作组织的经验。预计到明年春天，全省手工业生产合作社可发展到八百二十多个，手工业生产小组可发展到两千个。（滕春风）
