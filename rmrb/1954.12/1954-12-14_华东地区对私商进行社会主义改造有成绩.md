East China has made considerable achievements in the socialist transformation of private businesses. Of the thirty-nine cities in the region (including Shanghai), 5,928 wholesale businesses were included in the first batch of transformation plans, accounting for 34% of the total number of wholesale businesses. As of the end of November, 4,573 of these wholesale businesses have been settled and processed. Among them, 661 households were guided by the government to change their profession, and most of them have been put into production. 4,281 employees have been absorbed by the state for job assignments and are currently undergoing training. In Shanghai and other places, the Federation of Industry and Commerce also organized some capitalist practitioners to study. Among retailers, more than 90% of urban cotton cloth dealers and cotton cloth vendors have been incorporated into state capitalist forms.

Starting from early June, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong and other provinces successively convened meetings of responsible cadres from the special commissioner's offices and municipal financial and economic committees to study and deploy the planned socialist transformation of private businesses. Provinces and cities established leading groups and offices for this work. Major cities also transferred cadres, trained shop assistant activists, and organized work teams to prepare organizationally and ideologically. The transformation of private businesses in various places is generally divided into three steps: investigation and research, mobilization and education, and separate handling. In the process of work, all localities emphasized education and relied on the vast number of employees, and did a good job in labor-capital consultation. Through this stage of work, East China not only expanded the organized market and ensured the smooth implementation of the policies of unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth, but also specifically pointed out the way forward for private businesses; cadres in various places gained a lot of experience, laying a favorable foundation for further socialist transformation of private businesses in the future.

    华东地区对私商进行社会主义改造有成绩
    华东地区对私营商业进行社会主义改造的工作已经有不少成绩。全区三十九个城市（包括上海市），列入第一批改造计划的批发商有五千九百二十八户，占批发商总户数的百分之三十四。截至十一月底，这些批发商已经安置处理了四千五百七十三户。其中由政府辅导转业的六百六十一户，多数已经投入生产。由国家吸收分配工作和正在进行训练的职工有四千二百八十一人。上海等地还由工商业联合会组织了一部分资方从业人员进行学习。零售商中，城市棉布座商及棉布摊贩纳入国家资本主义形式的在百分之九十以上。
    从六月上旬起，江苏、浙江、福建、山东等省先后召集专署和市财政经济委员会负责干部开会，研究布置了有计划地对私营商业进行社会主义改造的工作。各省、市建立了领导这一工作的小组和办公室。主要城市还抽调干部，训练店员积极分子，组织工作队，进行了组织上和思想上的准备工作。各地对私商的改造工作一般分为调查研究、动员教育、分别处理三个步骤。在工作过程中，各地着重教育和依靠了广大职工，并作好了劳资协商工作。经过这一个阶段的工作，华东各地不仅扩大了有组织的市场，保证了棉布等统购统销政策的顺利贯彻，同时为私营商业具体地指明了前进的道路；各地干部获得了不少经验，为今后进一步对私营商业进行社会主义改造打下了有利的基础。
