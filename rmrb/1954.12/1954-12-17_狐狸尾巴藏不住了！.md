    The United States, in manipulating the United Nations General Assembly to "discuss" and pass an illegal resolution on the issue of China's punishment of American spies, intended to divert world attention from the US aggressive bloc's signing of the US-Chiang treaty and engaging in war threats, and to conceal its subversive activities. However, in recent days, the US aggressive bloc has achieved the opposite result.

    This so-called "resolution" illegally infringes upon China's judicial sovereignty and absurdly describes Arnold and the other eleven American spies as "prisoners of war," but it dares not mention the other two American spies, Downey and Fecteau. The spokespersons of the US aggressive bloc are even afraid to have anyone mention the names of these two American spies in the United Nations. This is indeed intriguing.

    About twenty days ago, when the US authorities began to quibble in the face of the verdict of our Supreme People's Court Military Tribunal, they listed all thirteen American spies together. In a statement issued by the US Department of Defense on November 24th, they even fabricated a long story about Downey and Fecteau, attempting to make them fit the prisoner-of-war status stipulated by the Geneva Convention, falsely accusing China of "violating the armistice agreement by refusing to repatriate them." In its shameless "protest" to China on November 26th, the US State Department also mentioned the so-called "eleven American armed forces personnel and two American civilian personnel employed by the Department of the Army" together, shouting that "the practice of detaining them is a clear violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement."

    However, a few days later, the US aggressive bloc suddenly changed its tune. The US representative at the United Nations General Assembly suddenly no longer advocated "mixing" the cases of Downey and the other two with the cases of the other eleven American spies; under the questioning of representatives from the Soviet Union and other countries, the likes of Lodge claimed that the United States "did not intend to seek United Nations protection for them (referring to Downey and Fecteau)."

    Why did the spokespersons of the US aggressive bloc fall into such a self-contradictory and inconsistent situation? Why didn't they want the United Nations to "protect" Downey and Fecteau? This is because, in order to quibble, they sank deeper and deeper into the mud, the fox's tail became more and more exposed, and they finally had to secretly abandon them.

    For example, the US authorities asserted that Downey and Fecteau hitched a
  "ride" from Seoul to Tokyo. The "Christian Science Monitor" in the United States was surprised and said: "It is difficult to understand how such a flight could get lost and end up in China." Indeed, this is a question that everyone can ask, and in fact, everyone understands the answer. A person flying "east" from Seoul towards Japan actually flew to China, which is thousands of miles west of Seoul. Such a myth is hard to find even in "Arabian Nights." Not only that, but the family member of one of these two American spies has publicly admitted to American newspapers that he was indeed working for the US intelligence agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, which made it even more impossible for the US aggressive bloc to quibble and had to acquiesce.

    Probably, the US aggressive bloc initially "estimated" that the spies Downey and Fecteau had long been "dead" (US Department of Defense statement), thinking that the stolen goods were gone and the traces were gone, and that everything was safe. Unexpectedly, they are still alive and have confessed in detail the inside story of the American spy crimes. As a result, the large and small American agencies in Washington and Tokyo were immediately panicked, each fabricating a set of lies to quibble, resulting in mutual slaps in the face, full of loopholes, making it impossible for the likes of Lodge to clean up the mess, so they had to avoid mentioning it.

    The spokespersons of the US aggressive bloc were no less embarrassed in their so-called "defense" of the other eleven American spies.

    At the United Nations General Assembly on the 8th, Lodge produced a so-called
  "radar map," insisting that it was "incontrovertible scientific evidence" that could "prove" that the American spy plane that infiltrated China was shot down in Korea. However, this false evidence did not need anyone else to
  "argue" against it; the US delegation immediately tore it up themselves. On the same day, it "retracted" it from reporters who had received copies of the forged evidence, while asking the American propaganda machine to "delete all mentions of the radar map" and admitting that it was "inaccurate." This is the kind of shady stuff that the so-called "incontrovertible evidence" of the United States is.

    After the false "evidence" collapsed without being attacked, Lodge and his flunkies stubbornly refused to admit defeat. Like a drowning man grabbing at a straw, they made a big deal out of the trivial issue of what clothes spies should wear. Lodge quibbled: "This is the only thing that matters, because the fact that these personnel (referring to Arnold et al.) were wearing military uniforms shows that they are not spies."

    Everyone knows that Arnold and others confessed clearly that they were not planning to land directly in China to become ground spies, but were flying into China in the dark of night to conduct spy reconnaissance, airdrop spy elements (Kuomintang elements), and provide assistance, pick up, and contact ground spy elements. What difference does it make whether you wear a military uniform or not when doing these evil deeds in the sky? However, Lodge and his echo chambers, such as Nutting, shouted that it was "outlandish" to do these things in military uniforms. They thought that everyone in the world was as easy to fool as fools.

    It is very clear that the US aggressive bloc cannot hide its fox's tail by relying on these clumsy and shameless fabrications, evasions, and sophistical tricks. In fact, the world has long known a lot about the American spy crimes. The US aggressive bloc openly implements espionage, sabotage, and subversion against foreign countries as a national policy. Especially towards China, it often shamelessly boasts that it colludes with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out espionage and sabotage activities in mainland China. The American "Stone Weekly" on December 6th stated: "We have been funding Chiang Kai-shek, and our Central Intelligence Agency has been boasting that it is carrying out the very activities (referring to American espionage activities) that Beijing is complaining about. Therefore, our government will not enter the court with clean hands."

    Indeed, although the American aggressors and their accomplices painstakingly brought out the United Nations organization as a cover for their aggressive crimes, in the face of the world's fair public opinion, their crimes are obvious; every shameless quibble of theirs only increases the hatred of the just and peace-loving people. It is puzzling that recently, some people have even called for a so-called "investigation" into China's handling of the case of American spies; some foreign newspapers have even falsely accused China of punishing American spies who sneaked into the country of "deliberately provoking the United States to take rash action." If this is not intentionally "aiding the evildoer," it is at least tainted with some of the stench of American aggressive crimes. This is something that everyone who cares about international peace and security and respects their own and other countries' sovereignty and security cannot ignore.

    狐狸尾巴藏不住了！
    李高
    美国操纵联合国大会“讨论”并通过有关我国惩办美国间谍问题的非法决议，本是为了转移世人对美国侵略集团签订美蒋条约、进行战争威胁的视线、并借此来掩藏其颠覆活动的狐狸尾巴的，但是这些天来，美国侵略集团所得到的结果，却是适得其反的。
    这个所谓“决议”非法侵犯我国的司法权，荒谬地把阿诺德等十一名美国间谍说成是什么“战俘”，但根本不敢提及另外两名美国间谍唐奈和费克图；美国侵略集团的代言人甚至害怕别人在联合国提起这两个美国间谍的名字。这确是耐人寻味的事。
    大约二十天前，美国当局在我最高人民法院军事审判庭的判决前面开始狡赖时，是把十三名美国间谍列在一起的。美国国防部十一月二十四日发表的一个声明中，还特别捏造了一大段关于唐奈和费克图的故事，企图使他们符合日内瓦战俘公约所规定的战俘身份，诬蔑我国“违反停战协定拒绝遣返他们”。美国国务院在十一月二十六日向我国提出的无耻“抗议”中，也是把所谓“十一名美国武装部队人员和陆军部雇用的两名美国文职人员”并提，叫喊“扣留他们的做法是显然违反朝鲜停战协定的”。
    但是，不几天之后，美国侵略集团突然改换了嘴脸。美国代表在联合国大会上忽然又不主张把唐奈等两人的案件和其他十一名美国间谍的案件“混在一起”；在苏联等国代表的诘问之下，洛奇之流才说是美国“不打算设法使他们（指唐奈和费克图）受联合国保护”。
    美国侵略集团的代言者们为什么陷入这样自相矛盾、前言不对后语的境地呢？究竟为什么不要联合国“保护”唐奈和费克图了呢？这就是因为他们为了狡辩，却使泥脚愈陷愈深，狐狸尾巴越来越暴露，终于不得不偷偷摸摸地把他们甩到一边去。
    例如：美国当局断言说，唐奈和费克图是搭
  “便机”从汉城到东京去的。美国的“基督教科学箴言报”就感到奇怪说：“难以理解的是：这样一次飞行，怎么会迷失到中国去，”的确，这是每个人都可以提出的问题，其实也是每个人都清楚的问题。从汉城“东”向日本飞行的人，居然飞到了远在汉城以西千里之外的中国，这种神话即使在“天方夜谭”里也是不容易找到的。不但这样，这两个美国间谍当中一人的家属，已向美国报纸公开承认他确是在美国间谍机关中央情报局工作的，这就使得美国侵略集团更加无法狡赖而不得不加以默认了。
    大概，美国侵略集团当初“估计”间谍唐奈和费克图早就“死了”（美国国防部声明），以为赃亡迹灭，平安无事了。万不料他们现在还活着，而且详细地供认了美国间谍罪行的底细，于是华盛顿和东京的美国大小机关顿时慌了手脚，各自胡诌一套来狡赖，结果是互打嘴巴，破绽百出，弄得洛奇之流无法收拾，只好以不提为妙了。
    美国侵略集团的代言人在为其他十一名美国间谍进行所谓“辩护”时，出丑的程度也不亚于此。
    洛奇在八日的联合国大会上拿出了一幅所谓
  “雷达镜地图”，硬说它是“不可争辩的科学证据”，能够“证明”潜入中国的美国间谍飞机是在朝鲜被击落的。但是，这个假证据用不着别人去
  “争辩”，美国代表团立刻就自己把它撕毁了。当天它就向拿到了这个伪证的副本的记者们把它“收回”，同时要美国宣传机器“删去所有提到雷达镜地图的话”，并且承认它是“不准确的”。美国所谓
  “不可争辩的证据”，就是这样见不得人的货色。
    假“证据”不攻自破之后，洛奇和他的帮闲们就硬着头皮死赖。他们像溺水者抓住一根稻草一样，在间谍应当穿什么衣服这个无聊的问题上大做文章。洛奇诡辩说：“这是唯一有关系的事情，因为这些人员（指阿诺德等）都穿着军装这一事实就表明他们不是间谍。”
    谁都知道，阿诺德等供认得清清楚楚，他们并不是准备直接降落到中国来做地面间谍的，而是坐着飞机黑夜偷入中国，进行间谍侦察、空投间谍分子（国民党分子）和接济、接回、联络地面的间谍分子等罪恶活动。在天空干这些罪恶勾当，穿不穿军服有什么分别呢？但是，洛奇和他的应声虫纳丁之流却大叫大嚷说，穿军服干这些事是“异想天开”的。他们以为全世界的人都像傻子一样容易被他们愚弄。
    十分明显，美国侵略集团凭借这些拙劣无耻的捏造、逃避和诡辩伎俩，是掩藏不了自己的狐狸尾巴的。其实美国的间谍罪行，是全世界早就知道了不少的。美国侵略集团公开把向外国进行特务间谍破坏和颠覆活动当作一种国家政策来执行。特别是对中国，它还时常无耻地夸耀它勾结蒋介石卖国集团向我国大陆进行间谍破坏活动。十二月六日的美国“斯通周刊”就说：“我们一直在资助着蒋介石，而且我们的中央情报局也一直在为它正是实行着北京所诉说的那种活动（指美国间谍活动）而吹嘘。因此，我们的政府是不会清白地走进法庭的。”
    的确，虽然美国侵略者及其帮凶们煞费苦心地把联合国组织搬出来作为其侵略罪恶的掩护，但在世界公正舆论面前，他们所犯罪行是昭然若揭的；他们每一次无耻狡赖，只有更加增长正义和爱好和平人民的憎恨。令人莫解的是：最近，还竟有人叫喊要对中国惩处美国间谍案进行什么“调查”；某些外国报纸竟诬蔑中国惩处偷入国境的美国间谍是“蓄意挑动美国采取轻率行动”。这如果不是有意“助桀为虐”的话，至少也是沾着一些美国侵略罪行的腥臭的。这是每一个关心国际和平和安全、尊重自己以及他国的主权和安全的人所不能忽视的。
