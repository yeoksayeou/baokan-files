    The First Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was victoriously held in Beijing, the capital. The meeting enthusiastically discussed the current situation and unanimously approved the political report made by Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai of the First National Committee.
    Our meeting is of great historical significance. The members participating in the meeting included representatives of all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic人士; the number of participating units and the aspects they represented have increased and expanded compared with the First National Committee. This shows that the great revolutionary unity of the Chinese people is being consolidated and developed along with the advancement of the Chinese people's democratic cause.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Democratic United Front has made significant contributions to the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, and in the past five years, it has achieved brilliant successes in assisting the government to mobilize and unite the people of the whole country in engaging in national construction and safeguarding peace. In the future, the Chinese People's Democratic United Front will continue to play its important role in completing the general task of the state's transition period and in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies.
    The unanimous desire of the Chinese people is to build a prosperous and happy socialist country. We are engaged in peaceful labor, and we need a peaceful environment, a peaceful world. However, the American aggressive bloc, which attempts to dominate the world, is not reconciled to its shameful defeat in China and has never ceased its interference and aggression against the People's Republic of China. Since launching the Korean War of aggression in June 1950, the US government has used armed forces to occupy China's territory of Taiwan. Now, the US government has signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, openly interfering in China's internal affairs, openly severing China's territory, openly infringing upon China's sovereignty, and openly threatening the Chinese people with war. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.
    The meeting unanimously expressed indignation at this serious act of war provocation by the US government. We vow to implement with all our might the joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan issued by all democratic parties and people's organizations in China on August 22, 1954. The Chinese people will never give up until Taiwan is liberated.
    Taiwan is Chinese territory. Sixty years ago, Japanese militarists forcibly occupied Taiwan. The Chinese people carried out a long-term struggle, and finally, in the victory of the great Anti-Japanese War, Taiwan was returned to the motherland on October 25, 1945. If it were not for the US aggressors openly violating the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, which it itself participated in signing, and armed occupation of Taiwan, sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the compatriots in Taiwan would have been liberated long ago. It must be pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has long been abandoned by the 600 million Chinese people, and it has no right to sign any treaty with any country. We will never tolerate the eight million compatriots in Taiwan suffering from the enslavement and rule of the US aggressors and Chiang bandits. We must never forget the tragic lessons of the Japanese militarists' occupation of Taiwan and Northeast China, and then their invasion of the whole of China. We must never allow the US aggressors to repeat the old tricks of the Japanese militarists' invasion of China.
    We sternly warn the US aggressive bloc and its followers that the era of imperialism dominating China is over. The US aggressive bloc's attempt to use the US-Chiang treaty to occupy Taiwan and expand its aggression against China can only strengthen the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang bandits. All absurd propositions such as Taiwan "neutralization," Taiwan "independent country," and Taiwan "trusteeship" are actually aiding US aggression and severing China's territory, which the Chinese people firmly oppose.
    The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang bandits, and smash the US-Chiang treaty!
    The US-Chiang treaty is part of the US war plan. The United States, unwilling to accept its failures in Korea, Indochina, and the European arms issue, is stepping up the organization of various military aggression blocs in the East and West, making enemies of peace-loving countries. In the East, the United States is attempting to link the US-Philippines "Mutual Defense Treaty," the US-Australia-New Zealand "Pacific Security Treaty," the US-Japan "Security Treaty," the US-South Korea "Mutual Defense Treaty," the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," and the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" to establish a military aggression system in the Western Pacific. In Europe, the United States and its followers signed the Paris Agreement, attempting to revive German militarism and arm West Germany to act as the aggressive vanguard of the North Atlantic Alliance. At the same time, the United States is also instigating the organization of a Middle East military aggression alliance. It is obvious that the purpose of the US aggressive bloc is to link these aggressive systems together, forming a world military aggression system, enslaving the local people, expanding the division of the world, and preparing for a new world war.
    The US war plan threatens the whole world. The people of Europe, who still vividly remember the trauma of World War II, cannot sit idly by and watch the revival of German militarism. The recent conference of European countries in Moscow embodied the firm will of the European people to oppose the Paris Agreement, stop the war crisis, and ensure European security. The Chinese people actively support the eight-nation declaration of the European countries' conference and firmly oppose the Paris Agreement. The French National Assembly's rejection of the West German arms protocol of the Paris Agreement on the 24th of this month once again reflects the urgent desire of the French people to oppose war and demand peace, and the Chinese people express warm welcome and support for this.
    We believe that the struggle against the US war plan and in defense of world peace is the common struggle of all peace-loving countries and peoples.
    The Chinese people have always advocated promoting international cooperation and maintaining world peace and security. This proposition of ours is in line with the interests of the people of the world. The growing strength and solid unity of China with the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is a reliable guarantee for maintaining world peace and security. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China, India, and Burma have won the broad support of peace-loving countries and peoples. The recent development of friendly relations between China and India, China and Burma, and China and Indonesia proves that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully. The Chinese people actively advocate implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and expanding the area of peace. We support the aspirations of the countries and peoples of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America for peace and independence. The Chinese people firmly advocate continuing to seek the peaceful reunification of Korea. The Chinese people firmly advocate implementing the agreement to restore peace in Indochina. The Chinese people support the recent joint declaration of the Chinese and Soviet governments on relations with Japan and are willing to establish normal relations with Japan. We are pleased to see that this proposition is receiving more and more response from the Japanese people.
    The Charter of the United Nations stipulates that the territorial integrity and political independence of any country shall not be violated. China will never infringe upon the territorial integrity and political independence of other countries, but it will never tolerate other countries infringing upon China's territorial integrity and political independence. Tolerating aggression will inevitably lead to war. The mistakes of history must not be repeated. The China of today is not the China of the "September 18th Incident" era, and the world of today is not the world of the "Munich" era. We warmly desire peace, but we will never sacrifice the country's territory and independence to beg for peace. We firmly oppose war, but we will never be intimidated by the threat of war. To defend peace, we must resist aggression. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai said: "If someone insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people will definitely give a resolute rebuff to the interferers and provocateurs." This represents the common determination and firm will of the entire Chinese people.
    In order to ease international tensions and for the sake of peace in Asia and the world, the US government must withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the Taiwan Strait, and stop infringing on China's territory and independence. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a struggle to defend their motherland and defend peace. We will fight to the end unswervingly!

    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议宣言
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会在首都北京胜利地举行了第一次全体会议。会议热烈地讨论了当前局势并一致同意第一届全国委员会周恩来副主席所作的政治报告。
    我们这次会议是有重大的历史意义的。参加会议的成员包括全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和其他爱国民主人士的代表；参加单位的名额和它所代表的方面都比第一届全国委员会有了增加和扩大。这表明中国人民的革命大团结正在随着中国人民民主事业的前进而日益巩固和发展。
    中国人民民主统一战线在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，对于中国人民革命的伟大胜利作了重大的贡献，并且五年来，在协助政府动员和团结全国人民从事国家建设和保卫和平的事业中，获得了光辉的成就。今后，中国人民民主统一战线在完成国家过渡时期的总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，仍将发挥它的重大作用。
    中国人民的一致愿望是建设一个繁荣幸福的社会主义国家。我们进行着和平的劳动，我们需要一个和平的环境，一个和平的世界。但是妄图称霸世界的美国侵略集团，不甘心它在中国的可耻的失败，一直没有停止过对中华人民共和国的干涉和侵略。美国政府自从一九五○年六月发动侵略朝鲜战争以来，就以武装力量霸占中国领土台湾。现在，美国政府又同蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”，公然干涉中国内政，公然割裂中国领土，公然侵犯中国主权，公然以战争来威胁中国人民，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    对于美国政府这种严重的战争挑衅行为，会议一致表示愤慨。我们誓以全力贯彻中国各民主党派各人民团体在一九五四年八月二十二日发表的为解放台湾联合宣言。中国人民不解放台湾，决不罢休。
    台湾是中国的领土。六十年前，日本军国主义者强占了台湾。中国人民进行了长期的斗争，终于在伟大抗日战争的胜利中，使台湾在一九四五年十月二十五日归还祖国。如果不是美国侵略者公然违反它自己参加签订的开罗宣言和波茨坦公告，武装侵占台湾，庇护蒋介石卖国集团，台湾同胞必然早已得到解放。必须指出，蒋介石卖国集团早已被六万万中国人民所唾弃，它没有任何资格同任何国家签订任何条约。我们决不能容忍台湾八百万同胞遭受美国侵略者和蒋贼的奴役统治。我们决不能忘记日本军国主义者侵占中国的台湾和东北进而侵略全中国的惨痛教训。我们决不能允许美国侵略者重演日本军国主义者侵略中国的故技。
    我们严正警告美国侵略集团和它的追随者，听任帝国主义宰割中国的时代已经过去了。美国侵略集团企图利用美蒋条约来霸占台湾，扩大对中国的侵略，这只能更加强中国人民解放台湾、消灭蒋贼的决心。一切所谓台湾“中立化”、台湾“独立国”和“托管”台湾等荒谬主张，实际上都是助长美国侵略，都是割裂中国领土，中国人民表示坚决反对。
    中国人民一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋贼，粉碎美蒋条约！
    美蒋条约是美国战争计划的一个组成部分。美国不甘心它在朝鲜、印度支那和欧洲军问题上的失败，就加紧在东方和西方组织各种军事侵略集团，同爱好和平的国家为敌。在东方，美国企图把美菲“共同防御条约”、美澳新“太平洋安全条约”、美日“安全条约”、美李“共同防御条约”、“东南亚集体防务条约”、美蒋“共同防御条约”等侵略条约连结起来，建立一个西太平洋的军事侵略体系。在欧洲，美国和它的追随者签订巴黎协定，企图复活德国军国主义，武装西德以充当北大西洋联盟的侵略先锋。与此同时，美国还在策动组织中东的军事侵略联盟。事实很明显，美国侵略集团的目的，是要把这些侵略体系连结起来，构成一个世界军事侵略体系，奴役当地的人民，扩大世界的分裂，准备新的世界战争。
    美国的战争计划威胁着全世界。对第二次世界大战的创痛记忆犹新的欧洲人民，尤其不能坐视德国军国主义的复活。最近在莫斯科举行的欧洲国家会议，体现了欧洲人民反对巴黎协定、制止战争危机、保障欧洲安全的坚决意志。中国人民积极支持欧洲国家会议的八国宣言，坚决反对巴黎协定。本月二十四日法国国民议会拒绝批准巴黎协定的武装西德议定书，这又一次反映了法国人民反对战争、要求和平的迫切愿望，中国人民对此表示热烈的欢迎和支持。
    我们认为，反对美国战争计划、保卫世界和平的斗争，是一切爱好和平的国家和人民的共同斗争。
    中国人民一向主张促进国际合作和维护世界和平和安全。我们这种主张是符合全世界人民的利益的。中国同伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家的日益强大和坚强团结，是维护世界和平和安全的可靠保障。中国、印度、缅甸共同倡导的和平共处的五项原则，获得了爱好和平的国家和人民的广泛支持。最近中印、中缅以及中国和印度尼西亚友好关系的发展，证明了不同社会制度的国家是可以和平共处的。中国人民积极主张推行和平共处的五项原则，扩大和平地区。我们支持亚洲、非洲和中、南美洲的国家和人民要求和平和独立的愿望。中国人民坚决主张继续谋求朝鲜的和平统一。中国人民坚决主张贯彻恢复印度支那和平的协议。中国人民拥护中苏两国政府最近关于对日本关系的联合宣言，愿意同日本建立正常关系。我们高兴地看到这种主张得到日本人民越来越多的响应。
    联合国宪章规定不得侵犯任何国家的领土完整和政治独立。中国决不侵犯别国的领土完整和政治独立，但是也决不容忍别国侵犯中国的领土完整和政治独立。容忍侵略，必将导致战争。历史的错误不许重演。现在的中国不是“九一八”时代的中国，现在的世界也不是“慕尼黑”时代的世界。我们热烈要求和平，但是决不会牺牲国家的领土和独立去乞求和平。我们坚决反对战争，但是决不会被战争威胁吓倒。为了保卫和平，必须反抗侵略。周恩来外长说：“如果有人硬要把战争强加在中国人民头上，中国人民一定要对干涉者和挑衅者给以坚决的回击。”这代表了全中国人民的共同决心和坚强意志。
    为了和缓国际紧张局势，为了亚洲和世界的和平，美国政府必须从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量，停止侵犯中国的领土和独立。中国人民解放台湾的斗争是保卫祖国、保卫和平的斗争，我们将不屈不挠地斗争到底！
    一九五四年十二月二十五日
