Xinhua News Agency, December 19th dispatch from New York: The Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly closed on December 17th.

On the last plenary meeting held on the 17th, some suggestions of the Social, Humanitarian, and Cultural Committee were approved, among which was a draft resolution on the issue of "forced labor." This issue was included in the Assembly's agenda at the insistence of the United States, and the discussion of this issue was part of the US-launched campaign to slander and hate the People's Republic of China. To achieve this unsavory purpose, the United States extensively utilized the United Nations. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against the approval of this draft resolution, and the delegations of ten countries abstained. Kuomintang elements spoke at the meeting to slander the People's Republic of China. His speech was extremely rude and outrageous, so that the chairman interrupted him and did not allow him to continue speaking. Soviet representative Saksin strongly protested the dissemination of slanderous remarks against the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, especially when no legitimate representative of the People's Republic of China was present.

Subsequently, the meeting discussed the report of the Special Political Committee on the issue of aggression against the People's Republic of China and the responsibility of the US Navy for these acts. The Assembly rejected, by a majority vote, the Soviet delegation's proposal aimed at stopping US aggression against the People's Republic of China and easing tensions in the Far East.

The meeting then discussed the issue of infringing on freedom of navigation on the Chinese sea, and passed a draft resolution forced on the Special Political Committee by the US delegation. This draft resolution avoided addressing the essence of the problem, but stipulated that the Special Political Committee formally transfer the relevant reports and documents on this issue to the United Nations International Law Commission, which had nothing to do with this issue. Soviet representative Sobolev said at the meeting that the Soviet delegation firmly opposed any attempt to condone piracy.

The Assembly then passed, by an overwhelming majority, the draft resolutions of the Political Committee on the issues of Morocco and Tunisia, with no delegation voting against. In the Political Committee, the delegations of the United States and other colonial countries had voted against the proposal on the issue of Morocco, but this proposal was finally passed by the committee. Many countries that consistently followed the US policy direction also did not support the US position on this issue. The US delegation obviously did not want to be isolated, so it also supported the proposal at the plenary meeting on the 17th, which it had voted against in the Political Committee. The delegations of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, Luxembourg, and other countries, which had voted against in the Political Committee, also supported this draft resolution like the US delegation.

The meeting also decided, based on the recommendation of the United Nations Secretary-General, to hold a ceremony in San Francisco between July 20th and 26th, 1955, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.

The Assembly's agenda has now been fully discussed, and Assembly President Van Kleffens announced the closure of the Ninth Session of the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency: The United Nations General Assembly passed, by a majority vote, the Political Committee's draft resolution on the Korean issue at the plenary meeting held on the 11th. This draft resolution was proposed by fifteen countries, including the United States, which participated in the intervention in the Korean War. It stipulated the approval of the fifteen countries' unilateral report on the Geneva Conference, and in practice, refused to resume negotiations on the Korean issue with the relevant parties. The Soviet Union, Poland, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, and Belarus voted against this draft resolution. India, Indonesia, Syria, and Burma abstained.

The plenary meeting that day also discussed the Special Political Committee's report on the issue of prohibiting war propaganda. When the Special Political Committee discussed this issue, the US-British majority group opposed the proposal put forward by Czechoslovakia requesting concrete measures to stop war propaganda. They also put forward amendments that changed the substance of this proposal. The US-British majority group replaced the measures suggested by Czechoslovakia with empty talk about so-called "freedom of the press." They did not suggest taking any effective measures to stop war propaganda, which shows that they are unwilling to end the war hysteria incited in the United States and certain other countries. The US-British majority group passed the proposal that they had amended at the plenary meeting.

The plenary meeting then unanimously passed the composition of the Peace Observation Commission for the next two years. Soviet representative Malik emphasized that the Soviet delegation's view in voting in favor of this proposal was that the Chinese representative in this committee should be, and can only be, the person appointed by the government of the People's Republic of China.

The plenary meeting also passed a proposal stipulating the establishment of a special United Nations fund to finance the development of industrially backward countries.

    联合国大会第九届会议举行最后一次会议
    美国再次利用联合国通过诽谤我国的决议
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会第九届会议在十二月十七日闭幕。
    在十七日举行的最后一次全体会议上，批准了社会、人道及文化委员会的若干建议，其中有关于
  “强迫劳动”问题的决议草案。这个问题是在美国的坚持下列入大会议程的，讨论这个问题是美国所发动的诽谤和仇视中华人民共和国的运动的一部分。为了达到这个不能见人的目的，美国广泛地利用了联合国。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克的代表团投票反对批准这个决议草案，十个国家的代表团弃权。国民党分子在会上发言诽谤中华人民共和国。他的发言极其粗暴和放肆，以致主席打断了他，并且不让他继续发言。苏联代表萨克辛坚决抗议在联合国散布诽谤中华人民共和国的言论，特别是在没有中华人民共和国合法代表出席的时候。
    接着，会议讨论特别政治委员会关于侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任问题的报告，大会以多数票否决了苏联代表团的目的在于停止美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为和缓和远东紧张局势的提案。
    会议接着讨论关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由问题，通过了美国代表团强迫特别政治委员会接受的决议草案。这个决议草案避而不谈问题的本质，却规定特别政治委员会把有关这个问题的报告和文件，形式上移交给同这个问题毫无关系的联合国国际法委员会。苏联代表索波列夫在会上说，苏联代表团坚决反对任何袒护海盗行为的企图。
    大会接着以压倒的多数通过了政治委员会关于摩洛哥问题和突尼斯问题的决议草案，没有一个代表团投票反对。在政治委员会中，美国和其他殖民国家的代表团曾经投票反对关于摩洛哥问题的提案，但是，这个提案终于被委员会通过了。许多一贯追随美国政策方针的国家，在这个问题上也不支持美国的立场。美国代表团显然不希望陷于孤立，于是它在十七日的全体会议上也支持了它在政治委员会投票反对过的提案。在政治委员会投过反对票的英国、荷兰、比利时、澳大利亚、卢森堡等代表团，也都像美国代表团一样支持了这个决议草案。
    会议还根据联合国秘书长的建议，决定在一九五五年七月二十日到二十六日之间在旧金山举行庆祝联合国成立十周年的仪式。
    大会议程至此全部讨论完毕，大会主席范·克里芬斯宣布联合国第九届会议闭幕。
    据新华社讯：联合国大会在十一日举行的全体会议上以多数票通过了政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的决议草案。这个决议草案由参加干涉朝鲜战争的美国等十五个国家提出的，其中规定批准十五国关于日内瓦会议的片面报告，并且在实际上拒绝有关各方恢复关于朝鲜问题的谈判。苏联、波兰、乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克和白俄罗斯投票反对这个决议草案。印度、印度尼西亚、叙利亚和缅甸弃权。
    这一天的全体会议还讨论了特别政治委员会关于禁止战争宣传问题的报告。在特别政治委员会讨论这个问题时，美英多数集团反对捷克斯洛伐克提出的要求采取具体措施来制止战争宣传的提案，它们并且提出了改变这个提案的实质的修正案。美英多数集团以关于所谓“新闻自由”的空话来代替捷克斯洛伐克建议采取的措施，它们没有建议采取任何有效措施来制止战争宣传，这就说明它们不愿意结束在美国和某些其他国家煽起的战争歇斯底里。美英多数集团在全体会议上通过了经过它们修改的提案。
    全体会议接着还一致通过了和平观察委员会今后两年中的组成成员。苏联代表马立克着重指出，苏联代表团投票赞成这个提案时所持的观点是：这个委员会中的中国代表应当是，而且也只能是中华人民共和国政府指派的人员。
    全体会议并且通过一个提案，规定成立一个特别的联合国基金组织来资助工业落后国家的发展。
