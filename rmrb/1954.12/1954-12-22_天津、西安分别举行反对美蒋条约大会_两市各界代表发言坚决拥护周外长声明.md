    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 21st: People from all walks of life in Tianjin held a rally on December 21st to oppose the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." Over two thousand representatives from all sectors attended the rally.

    The rally was hosted by the Tianjin Municipal Consultative Committee, the local organizations of various democratic parties in Tianjin, and various people's organizations in Tianjin. Wang Kangzhi, from the Propaganda Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, first explained and analyzed the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" and the current situation. He pointed out that the U.S.-Chiang treaty is a further criminal step by U.S. imperialism to endanger world peace, following the Manila Treaty and the Paris Accords. He called on the people of the city to transform their anger into strength, further heighten vigilance, strengthen unity, strive to complete and over fulfill the national plan, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, smash the U.S.-Chiang treaty, and fight to defend the motherland, defend the socialist construction cause, and defend peace in the Far East and the world. Representatives from the Tianjin local organizations of various democratic parties, as well as representatives from Tianjin's workers, women, youth, cultural and educational circles, and business circles, spoke out, all angrily denouncing the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to forcibly occupy China's territory of Taiwan and carry out a new war under the guise of a treaty. Zhang Qinnan, representative of the Tianjin local organizations of various democratic parties, said: U.S. imperialism is signing the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" in the East, organizing the Southeast Asia group, and planning to sign the Paris Accords in the West, arming West Germany, and preparing for a new war. The Tianjin local organizations of various democratic parties resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and will fight to liberate Taiwan.

    Fu Hongbin, representing the workers of Tianjin, stated that they would oppose the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" with practical actions such as diligently studying Soviet experience, carrying out technical innovations, abiding by labor discipline, further launching campaigns to increase production and practice economy, completing the national plan ahead of schedule, and preparing for next year's production. Women's representative Yu Aifeng pointed out that the Chinese people will never be intimidated by war. Women in Tianjin will do their job well in their respective posts, do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, heighten vigilance, prevent sabotage by special agents, and fight to protect the happiness of women and children. Wu Daren, representing 500,000 youth and cultural and educational circles in Tianjin, denounced: U.S. imperialism wants to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism, which the Chinese people will never allow. Defending the integrity of the motherland's territory is our youth's sacred duty. We warmly desire peace and also know how to defend a peaceful life. We have been tempered in the anti-aggression war; we not only have determination but also have strength. Bi Mingqi, representative of the business community, said: Any interference or threat from U.S. imperialism cannot shake our determination to liberate Taiwan. The business community must unite around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, abide by the Constitution, actively accept socialist transformation, and strive to manage industry and commerce well.

    The rally finally passed the "Resolution on Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement, Resolutely Opposing the U.S.-Chiang 'Mutual Defense Treaty,' and Being Determined to Liberate Taiwan."

    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 21st: More than 1,200 people from all walks of life in Xi'an gathered on the 20th to oppose the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." At the meeting, representatives from all sectors, including the Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City Consultative Committees, various democratic parties, people's organizations, workers, peasants, families of revolutionary soldiers, students, and ethnic minorities, spoke enthusiastically, unanimously opposing the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" and expressing their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement.

    Fang Zhongru, Second Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, said in his speech: Today's meeting expresses the most resolute opposition of the people of Xi'an to the U.S.-Chiang treaty and expresses our unwavering determination to liberate Taiwan. We warmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." Fang Zhongru called on the people of the city to heighten vigilance, strengthen unity, further increase production and practice economy, guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the national construction plan, and especially vigorously support important engineering construction, undertaking the dual tasks of liberating Taiwan and completing national industrialization.

    Kang Xinzai, representative of the Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City Consultative Committees, said at the meeting: The people of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City, in order to achieve their own liberation, have done their best to support the domestic liberation war; in order to defend their homes and defend the country, they have also contributed tremendous strength to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Now, for the integrity of our country's territory and the security of the motherland, for peace in Asia and the world, and for our freedom and happiness, we must do our utmost to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    The meeting finally unanimously passed the resolution of the Xi'an people's rally against the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty."
