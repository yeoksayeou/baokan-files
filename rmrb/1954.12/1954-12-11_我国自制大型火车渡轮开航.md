Our country's first domestically made large train ferry, the "Beijing No. 2," solemnly held its inaugural ceremony at the Xujiapeng lower wharf in Wuchang on the 9th. As the ceremony began, after Li Xuan, Deputy Director of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, cut the ribbon, railway cars drove one by one from the shore onto the ship's deck. Captain Chen Yichun issued the sailing order, and this large ferry surged forward, riding the waves of the Yangtze River.

Now, this large train ferry has officially taken on the train transportation work at the Wuhan ferry crossing. Before the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is built, it has become a "mobile bridge" connecting the Beijing-Hankou and Yue-Han railways.

    我国自制大型火车渡轮开航
    我国自制的第一艘大型火车渡轮“北京二号”，于九日在武昌徐家棚下码头隆重举行开航典礼。典礼开始，在郑州铁路管理局副局长李轩剪彩后，一节节车皮从岸上驶进船的甲板上，船长陈义春发出开航命令，这艘大型渡轮便冲击着长江的波浪前进。
    现在这艘大型火车渡轮已经正式担负起武汉渡口的火车运输工作。在武汉长江大桥未建成以前，它已成为联结京汉和粤汉两条铁路的“活动桥梁”。
