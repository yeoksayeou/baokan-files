Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The experience exchange reception room of the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievement Exhibition had received more than 1,140 questions from all over the country by the 28th. Among them, factories and mines in Beijing raised more than 480 questions. During the week of the 22nd to the 28th, Soviet experts went to more than ten units, including the Iron and Steel Testing Institute of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Central Meteorological Observatory, the State-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, and Peking University, to provide specific guidance.

Soviet experts conducted a total of fourteen experience exchanges with teachers and students from the Painting Department, Sculpture Department, and Arts and Crafts Research Office of the Central Academy of Fine Arts. Factories from other places also sent people to Beijing to participate in this experience exchange work, and have already achieved good results. For example, a Soviet "threading machine" installed this year at the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory has not been put into production because the tool adjustment was not good, and the screws made were cross-threaded. This problem was solved after the Soviet experts explained the performance of the threading machine chuck in detail. The biggest difficulty that the Shenyang Bicycle Factory has not been able to solve for several years is poor electroplating, which easily rusts. In this experience exchange meeting, Soviet experts have put forward effective improvement suggestions.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Five Soviet experts invited to participate in the experience exchange work of the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievement Exhibition arrived in Beijing before the 18th. These five experts are: metal high-speed cutting expert Shchogolev, hydropower expert Zolotarev, industrial and civil construction expert Gorbushin, cotton planting expert Avtonomov, and animal husbandry expert Papkov. After arriving in Beijing, the experts actively participated in the experience exchange work of the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievement Exhibition. Zolotarev gave a report on the development of Soviet hydropower at the auditorium of the Ministry of Fuel Industry on the 22nd and 27th. More than 1,100 people from the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Water Resources, Tsinghua University and other units attended the lecture. In addition, Shchogolev, Zolotarev, and Gorbushin also gave reports and guided work at Tsinghua University and the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design, respectively.

    苏联展览会的经验交流工作有很好的收获
    又有五位苏联专家应邀到京参加经验交流工作
    【新华社三十日讯】苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的经验交流接待室，到二十八日止，共收到全国各地提出的问题一千一百四十多个。其中北京市各厂矿就提了四百八十多个问题。二十二日到二十八日一周内，苏联专家曾到重工业部钢铁试验所、中央气象台、国营北京第一棉纺织厂、北京大学等十多个单位作了具体指导。
    苏联专家和中央美术学院绘画系、雕塑系、工艺美术研究室的师生，一共进行了十四次经验交流。外地的工厂也有派人到北京来参加这一经验交流工作的，并且已经有很好的收获。如沈阳空气压缩机厂今年安装的一台苏联“绞丝机”，因为对刀调整不好，做出的螺丝乱扣，因此到现在还没有投入生产。这次经过苏联专家详细讲解绞丝机卡盘性能后，解决了这个问题。沈阳自行车厂几年来不能解决的一个最大困难问题是电镀不好，容易生锈。在这次经验交流的会谈中，苏联专家已提出了有效的改进意见。
    【新华社三十日讯】应邀参加苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会经验交流工作的五位苏联专家已在十八日前先后到达北京。这五位专家是：金属高速切削专家晓戈列夫，水能动力专家佐洛塔廖夫，工业及民用建筑专家戈尔布申，植棉专家阿夫托诺莫夫，畜牧专家帕普科夫。专家们到达北京后，积极地参加了苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的经验交流工作，佐洛塔廖夫已于二十二、二十七两日在燃料工业部礼堂作了关于苏联水电事业的发展情况的报告。听讲的有燃料工业部、水利部、清华大学等单位的人员一千一百多人。此外，晓戈列夫、佐洛塔廖夫、戈尔布申还曾分别到清华大学和北京市设计院作报告，并指导工作。
