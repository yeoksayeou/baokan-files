Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 20th: TASS reports: On December 17th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered to the embassies in Moscow of Finland, Yugoslavia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Austria, the Soviet government's note in reply to the aforementioned countries' responses to the Soviet Union's note of November 13th concerning the convocation of an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system.

    The Soviet government's note to the Finnish government stated that it noted the Finnish government's indication of agreement with the Soviet Union's efforts to establish a European collective security system. Therefore, the Soviet government could not help but express regret at the Finnish government's failure to participate in the all-European conference to discuss European collective security. The note stated that at a time when certain Western countries are reviving German militarism and incorporating West Germany into military blocs directed against peace-loving European nations, the issue of uniting all European countries to jointly guarantee European peace and security is of particularly great significance. The Soviet government anticipates that the Finnish government will contribute its share to the establishment of a European collective security system.

    The Soviet government's note to the Yugoslav government stated that the Soviet government noted that the Yugoslav government's note said it supported the Soviet proposal to hold a conference and believed that holding a conference in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter would greatly contribute to the easing of international tensions.

    The note stated that the Yugoslav government's appropriate assessment of the threat posed by the revival of the West German "Defense Force" to the people of Western Europe and Yugoslavia's contribution to the establishment of European collective security would be of far-reaching significance. The Yugoslav people have twice in a generation suffered the ravages of wars of plunder by German militarism.

    The Soviet government still believes that the genuine security of the people of Europe can only be ensured by rejecting the revival of German militarism and plans to incorporate Germany into military blocs, and by establishing a system of collective security for European countries.

    In its note to the Swedish government, the Soviet government pointed out that it regretted that the Swedish government felt unable to participate in the all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system, even though the Swedish government believed that the purpose of this conference was to ease international tensions and strengthen European peace.

    The note provided explanations to the Swedish government's note concerning the issues raised by the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a European collective security system. The note stated that much material of interest to the Swedish government regarding these issues is contained in the draft "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security" proposed by the Soviet government at the Berlin Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference and in various notes on this issue.

    The note stated that the Soviet proposal to establish a European collective security system has received the full support of the governments of the countries participating in the Moscow European Conference, and the governments of various countries have expressed their willingness to consider any other suggestions regarding this issue. The Soviet government is, of course, willing to study any suggestions that the Swedish government may put forward regarding the European collective security system.

    In its note to the Swiss government, the Soviet government pointed out that the Swiss government stated in its note that it supports all initiatives aimed at establishing a lasting system of peace and security throughout the world, especially in Europe. The note stated that the proposal to convene an all-European conference is in line with the task of guaranteeing European peace and security. Therefore, the Soviet government regrets that the Swiss government feels unable to attend that conference.

    The note also pointed out that the Swiss government stated in its note that the Swiss government "has always and continues to endeavor to help" ensure European peace and security. The note stated that the Soviet government believes that only by rejecting the re-militarization of West Germany and rejecting plans to incorporate West Germany into military blocs, and establishing an effective European collective security system with the participation of all European countries, can the genuine security of the people of Europe be guaranteed.

    In its note to the Austrian government, the Soviet government expressed regret at the Austrian government's refusal to participate in the all-European conference. The note pointed out that the Austrian government stated that it would only be able to participate in the all-European conference if all the countries occupying Austria participated in the conference. The Austrian government wants to use this argument to justify its refusal to participate in the conference.

    The note stated that in this regard, the Soviet government cannot but draw the attention of the Austrian government to the fact that the governments of France, Britain, and the United States, which are vigorously implementing the policy of re-militarizing West Germany, have refused to participate in the negotiations proposed by the Soviet Union, and they insist that the necessary conditions for the success of a conference to discuss "Germany, Austria, and other issues related to European security" do not currently exist.

    The note stated that the establishment of European collective security is in the interests of Austria. Militaristic Germany occupied Austria by means of the Anschluss on the eve of World War II. The Paris Accords would only increase the danger of militaristic West Germany annexing Austria and create new obstacles to the final resolution of the Austrian question.

    Attached to the notes to the aforementioned countries was the full text of the declaration of the Moscow Conference of European countries guaranteeing European peace and security.

    就建立欧洲集体安全体系问题
    苏联政府复照芬兰等五国政府
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部十七日把苏联政府致芬兰、南斯拉夫、瑞典、瑞士和奥地利政府的照会交给上述国家驻莫斯科的使馆，这个照会答复了上述国家对苏联十一月十三日关于召开全欧会议讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系照会的覆照。
    苏联政府致芬兰政府的照会说：注意到芬兰政府表明它赞同苏联为建立欧洲集体安全体系所作的努力，因此苏联政府对芬兰政府未能参加讨论欧洲集体安全的全欧会议一事不能不表示遗憾。照会说，正当目前某些西方国家在复活德国军国主义并且使西德加入针对爱好和平的欧洲国家的军事集团的时候，团结所有欧洲国家为共同保证欧洲的和平和安全而努力的问题具有特别重大的意义。苏联政府设想芬兰政府将会在建立欧洲集体安全体系方面贡献它的一份力量。
    苏联政府致南斯拉夫政府的照会说：苏联政府注意到南斯拉夫政府的照会中说：它支持苏联建议举行一个会议的主张，并且认为举行一个符合联合国宪章原则的会议，将会大大有助于国际紧张局势的缓和。
    照会说：南斯拉夫政府对西德“国防军”的复活对西欧人民的威胁作适当的估计和南斯拉夫对建立欧洲集体安全的贡献，将具有深远的意义。南斯拉夫人民在一代的时期中，曾经两度遭到德国军国主义的掠夺战争的蹂躏。
    苏联政府仍然认为，欧洲各国人民的真正安全只有拒绝复活德国军国主义和让德国加入军事集团的计划，通过建立欧洲国家的集体安全体系的办法才能确保。
    苏联政府在致瑞典政府的照会中指出，苏联政府对瑞典政府认为不能参加讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的全欧会议感到遗憾，虽然瑞典政府认为这个会议目的在于缓和国际紧张局势和加强欧洲和平。
    照会对瑞典政府照会中就苏联建立欧洲集体安全体系建议提出的问题作了说明。照会说：瑞典政府感到兴趣的有关这些问题的许多材料包含在苏联政府在柏林四国外长会议提出的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案中和在关于这个问题的各项照会中。
    照会说：苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的主张得到参加莫斯科欧洲国家会议的各国政府的完全支持，各国政府已经表示愿意考虑关于这个问题的其他任何建议。苏联政府方面当然愿意研究瑞典政府可能提出的关于欧洲集体安全体系的任何建议。
    苏联政府在致瑞士政府的照会中指出，瑞士政府在照会中声明，它支持目的在于在全世界、特别是在欧洲建立持久的和平和安全制度的一切倡议。照会说：召开全欧会议的建议是符合保证欧洲和平和安全的任务的，因此苏联政府对于瑞士政府认为不能出席那个会议表示遗憾。
    照会又指出，瑞士政府在照会中声明，瑞士政府“一向并且现在仍然在努力帮助”保障欧洲和平和安全。照会说：苏联政府认为，只有拒绝西德重新军国主义化和拒绝让西德加入军事集团的计划，建立有一切欧洲国家参加的、有效的欧洲集体安全体系，欧洲各国人民的真正安全才能得到保证。
    苏联政府在致奥地利政府的照会中，对于奥地利政府拒绝参加全欧会议表示遗憾。照会指出，奥地利政府说：只有在占领奥地利的所有国家都参加全欧会议的情况下，它才能够参加这个会议。奥地利政府想用这种论调来为它拒绝参加会议辩解。
    照会说：在这方面，苏联政府不能不提请奥地利政府注意：正在竭力实行使西德重新军国主义化政策的法国、英国和美国政府已经拒绝参加苏联所建议的谈判，它们硬说讨论“德国、奥地利和关于欧洲安全方面的其他问题”的会议获得成功的必要条件目前还不存在。
    照会说，建立欧洲集体安全是符合奥地利的利益的，军国主义德国在第二次世界大战前夕用德奥合并的办法占领了奥地利，巴黎协定只会使军国主义的西德合并奥地利的危险增加，而使奥地利问题最后解决遇到新障碍。
    随同致上述国家照会附去了欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全莫斯科会议宣言全文。
