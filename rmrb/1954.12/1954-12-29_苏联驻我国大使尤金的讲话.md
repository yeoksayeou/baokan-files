Comrades, friends!

    Please allow me to sincerely extend warm congratulations to the representatives of the conference and wish them further achievements in their work both during and after the conference.

    The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established almost simultaneously with the founding of the People's Republic of China, which is of great significance. As everyone knows, the fraternal alliance and friendship between our two great peoples began to develop particularly rapidly after the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution. However, in old China, this friendship was suppressed by imperialists and domestic reactionaries. The founding of the People's Republic of China opened a new era of friendly cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. One of the vivid manifestations of the new fraternal relationship between our two peoples is the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

    In the past five years, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has become the largest and most extensive organization in China. It enjoys great prestige not only in China but also in the Soviet Union. Thanks to the active and fruitful activities of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Soviet people have been able to acquire profound and multifaceted knowledge about the lives of the Chinese people and their struggle for socialism.

    The cultural ties between China and the Soviet Union are an important link in the great friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples. The growth and strengthening of this connection is a valuable contribution to the struggle to defend peace and develop advanced culture; this advanced culture affirms friendship among all nationalities and abandons everything that sows discord and mistrust among them.

    The Soviet and Chinese peoples stand firmly at the forefront of defending world peace and the cause of human progress. Our cause is just and in line with the interests of our two peoples and the peoples of all countries in the world. This is the source of our invincible strength. The great friendship and cooperation between China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries is a strong and reliable pillar of world peace, the hope of all mankind, and an unparalleled force in the world.

    Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples – a powerful factor for world peace that is constantly developing!

    苏联驻我国大使尤金的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    请允许我诚挚地向代表会的代表们致热烈的祝贺，并祝他们在代表会上以及代表会后的工作中都获得进一步的成就。
    中苏友好协会差不多是和中华人民共和国的成立同时建立的，这个事实是有极大的意义的。大家知道，我们两国伟大人民的兄弟同盟和友谊在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以后，开始特别迅速地发展起来。但是，在旧中国，这种友谊遭到了帝国主义者和国内反动派的扼制。中华人民共和国的成立开辟了苏中两国人民友好合作的新纪元。我们两国人民新的兄弟关系的鲜明表现之一，就是中苏友好协会的建立。
    五年来，中苏友好协会已成为中国规模最大的最广泛的组织。它不仅在中国，而且在苏联都拥有巨大的威信。由于中苏友好协会的积极的和富有成效的活动，苏联人民有可能获得关于中国人民的生活和中国人民为社会主义而斗争的深刻的多方面的知识。
    苏中文化的联系是苏中人民的伟大友谊的重要一环。这种联系的成长和加强，是对于保卫和平的斗争和发展先进文化的宝贵贡献；这种先进的文化肯定了各族人民间的友谊，抛弃了在各族人民中间散播纠纷和不信任的一切东西。
    苏联人民和中国人民坚定不移地站在保卫全世界和平和人类进步事业的前列。我们的事业是正义的，是符合于我们两国人民和全世界各国人民的利益的。这就是我们的不可战胜的力量的源泉。中国、苏联和人民民主国家间的伟大的友好合作，是全世界和平的有力的可靠的支柱，是全人类的希望，是全世界不可匹敌的力量。
    苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊与合作——全世界和平的强有力的因素日益发展，万岁！
