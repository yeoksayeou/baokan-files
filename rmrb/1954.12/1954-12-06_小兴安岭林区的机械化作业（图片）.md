Mechanized Operations in the Lesser Khingan Mountains Forest Area

The Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area in Northeast China is gradually adopting mechanized and electrified operations. From felling, timber gathering, and transporting to log making and piling, this series of production processes is operated by machinery and electricity. Due to the high efficiency of machinery and fewer personnel required, not only is the consumption of timber reduced and the output is up to standard, the cost of felling is relatively reduced. It is also changing the seasonal and rush-based production of the forestry industry that has been in place for many years, and moving towards year-round operations.

　　The efficiency of winch timber gathering is more than seven times higher than that of using livestock.

　　Using a derrick-type piling machine for piling operations eliminates the heavy physical labor of forestry workers.

　　The forest railway is the main artery of the forest area. Batches of timber are being concentrated by locomotives, ready for transshipment.

　　Hundreds of tractors in the Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area are responsible for transporting timber.

    小兴安岭林区的机械化作业
    东北小兴安岭林区逐步采用机械化、电气化作业，从伐木、集材、搬运到造材和归楞，这一系列的生产过程都是用机械和电力操作的。由于机械效率高，用人少，不仅使木材的消耗减少，出材合乎规格，伐木成本相对减低，而且改变了多年来森林工业的季节性、突击性生产，而走向常年作业。摄影：林业部李福铸　新华社谭志强
    绞盘机集材的效率，比用牲畜集材的效率提高七倍多。
    用架杆式归楞机进行归楞作业，消灭了林业工人繁重的体力劳动。

    森林铁路是林区的大动脉。一批批的木材正由机车集中，准备转运。
    在小兴安岭林区有数百台拖拉机担负着运材的工作。
