    Resolutely Defeat the Plan to Revive German Militarism!
    The French People Strengthen Their Struggle to Consolidate Victory
    Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: Paris Dispatch: The French people are continuing their struggle to defeat the plan to revive German militarism.
      “L'Humanité” reports: The French people have organized even larger delegations in various places, preparing to visit members of the National Assembly starting on the 27th (the day the National Assembly reconvenes and is scheduled to vote on the Mendès France confidence motion) in order to “consolidate and expand the initial victories already achieved and win the final victory.”
    Workers in many factories held short strikes on the 24th to demonstrate their determination to block West German remilitarization. Those holding strikes included 3,500 employees of the "Fives-Lille" factory in Lille, miners in the Gard province, workers at the "Asthom" factory in Nob, Hautes-Pyrénées, and workers in many other factories.
    The French National Peace Council issued a letter to the French people, emphasizing that the victory of the struggle for peace and international security in the future depends on the persistent actions of the French people. The letter pointed out that rejecting the Paris Agreement can allow France to maintain its alliance with other countries and enable France to play a decisive role in Europe. The letter said: "Public opinion has never ceased to express its opposition to arming West Germany in various forms, and public opinion has the right to demand that the National Assembly reaffirm the vote of December 24."
    Democratic newspapers on the 25th published a statement from the Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT), calling on CGT members to organize "various actions" from the morning of the 27th to oppose the Paris Agreement.
    The statement said: "The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor pays tribute to the working people and organizations who actively participated in the nationwide movement against the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements. Some people are trying to use lies and empty talk to cover up the serious dangers that arming West Germany will bring to the world and France, but these attempts have not been able to paralyze the vigilance of the working people. This popular protest has achieved initial results: the government has not been able to ratify the agreement as quickly as it intended. However, danger still exists. The government is intensifying its conspiracy to get the London and Paris Agreements ratified. After suffering defeat, the government is trying its best to force the National Assembly to overturn the first resolution." The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor called on all working people and all trade union organizations to intensify the struggle against the plan to arm West Germany, to send delegations to visit members of parliament, and to hold rallies, meetings, and short strikes. The statement said that the plan to arm German militarists can be stopped. The threat posed by the London and Paris Agreements to peace can be eliminated. The working class, united, can play a decisive role in guaranteeing the victory of the forces of peace, thereby opening a path for further easing international tensions through negotiations to ensure universal security and disarmament.
    “L'Humanité” also reported the defeat of those who advocated arming West Germany in the Seine Provincial Council. At the council's meeting on the 24th, a group of council members demanded that their proposal be discussed as an urgent agenda item. They suggested that the National Assembly should not ratify the agreement on the revival of the German army "under the current circumstances." The prefect of the Seine tried to play procedural tricks to obstruct the discussion of this proposal. However, the prefect's motion was rejected by a vote of 52 against, 1 in favor, and 2 abstentions.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: According to a TASS report from Paris on December 25th: The French National Assembly's rejection on the 24th of the clause on arming West Germany in the bill to ratify the Paris Agreement has become the focus of commentary in French newspapers.
    French democratic public opinion believes that the National Assembly's vote was a serious defeat for the Mendès France government.
    The right-wing newspaper "Le Figaro" does not conceal its annoyance at the outcome of the National Assembly vote. But the newspaper also admitted that some members of parliament were afraid of being accused of being accomplices in arming West Germany in future election campaigns, so they voted against the clause on arming West Germany in the Paris Agreement.
    “Combat” wrote: "Not a single person who spoke (in the National Assembly) dared to publicly defend the arming of West Germany. Even those who advocated arming West Germany appeared embarrassed rather than confident. No one could hide the danger of arming West Germany." "Healthy thinking and patriotism restored people's consciences, causing them to oppose France risking the revival of German militarism."
    Democratic newspapers emphasized that no matter what the outcome of the vote on the Paris Agreement through the confidence vote on the Mendès France government held on December 27, those who advocate arming West Germany must not receive broad national support. "Libération" wrote: "Even if Mendès France uses extremely despicable means to change the color of some votes (a white ballot for 'yes' and a green ballot for 'no'), this can never get him the 'broad national majority' that he believes is necessary for him to remain in power."

    坚决击败复活德国军国主义的计划！
    法国人民为巩固胜利加强斗争
    【新华社二十六日讯】巴黎消息：法国人民正在为击败复活德国军国主义的计划而继续斗争。
      “人道报”报道：法国人民已经在各地组织更多更大的代表团，准备从二十七日起（这一天，国民议会复会并且将要就孟戴斯—弗朗斯提出的信任案举行投票），到国民议会去访问议员，以求“巩固并扩大已经获得的初步战果，并赢得最后胜利。”
    许多工厂的工人在二十四日举行短时间罢工，以显示他们阻挡西德重新军国主义化的决心。举行罢工的有里尔市“费夫—里尔”工厂三千五百名职工、加尔省的矿工、上比利牛斯省诺布市“阿斯多姆”工厂的工人以及其他许多工厂的工人。
    法国全国和平理事会发表告法国人民书，着重指出：今后争取和平和国际安全的斗争的胜利取决于法国人民坚持不懈的行动。告人民书指出：拒绝巴黎协定可以使法国保持同其他国家的同盟，使法国在欧洲起决定作用。告人民书说：“舆论从来没有停止过以各种各样的形式表示反对武装西德，舆论有权要求国民议会再度肯定十二月二十四日的表决。”
    民主报纸二十五日刊载了法国总工会执行局的声明，声明号召总工会会员从二十七日上午开始组织“各种行动”以反对巴黎协定。
    声明说：“法国总工会执行局向积极参加全国反对批准伦敦和巴黎协定的运动的劳动人民和组织致敬。有人企图用谎言和说空话来掩饰武装西德将为全世界和法国带来的严重危险，然而这些企图都没有能够麻痹劳动人民的警惕。这次人民的抗议已获得了初步成果：政府没有能够像它所打算的那样，迅速批准协定。但是，危险仍然存在。政府正在加紧进行阴谋活动，企图使伦敦和巴黎协定获得批准。政府在遭受失败后，正在竭力强迫国民议会推翻第一次的决议。”法国总工会执行局号召全体劳动人民和所有的工会组织加紧反对武装西德的计划的斗争，派遣代表团访问议员，举行大会、集会和短时间罢工。声明说，武装德国军国主义分子的计划是可以制止的。伦敦和巴黎协定对和平造成的威胁是可以消除的。工人阶级团结起来，就能够对于保证和平力量的胜利起决定性的作用，从而为通过保障普遍安全和裁军的谈判去谋求进一步缓和国际紧张局势打开一条道路。
    “人道报”还报道了主张武装西德的人在塞纳省省议会中的失败。在省议会二十四日的会议上，有一批省议员要求作为紧急议程讨论他们提出的建议。他们建议国民议会“在目前的情况下”不批准关于复活德国军队的协定。塞纳省省长企图在程序上耍手段，阻挠讨论这一建议。但是，省长的动议以五十二票反对、一票赞同、两票弃权遭到否决。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十五日讯：法国国民议会二十四日否决批准巴黎协定法案中关于武装西德的一条，成为法国各报评论的中心。
    法国民主舆论认为，国民议会这个表决结果是孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府的严重失败。
    右派报纸“费加罗报”并不掩饰它对国民议会表决结果感到烦恼。但这个报纸也承认，有些议员害怕在将来的选举运动中被人指责他们在武装西德上做了帮凶，所以他们投票反对巴黎协定中关于武装西德的一条。
      “战斗报”写道：“没有一个（在国民议会上）发言的人敢公开为武装西德辩护。甚至那些主张武装西德的人也是表现得很狼狈，而不是表现得有信心。没有谁掩饰得了武装西德的危险。”“健康的思想和爱国感恢复了人的良心，使他们反对法国去冒复活德国军国主义的危险。”
    民主报纸着重指出，不管十二月二十七日举行的以对孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府信任投票表决巴黎协定的结果如何，主张武装西德的人绝不能得到全国的广泛支持。“解放报”写道：“即使孟戴斯—弗朗斯使用极其卑鄙的手段改变了某些票的颜色（投‘赞成’票的是白票，投‘反对’票的是绿票），但这也决不能使他获得他认为他继续当权所必需的那种‘广泛的全国多数’。”
