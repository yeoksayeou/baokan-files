The Benxi City Public Security Bureau uncovered counter-revolutionary criminals Luan Xiaochen, Yuan Hongtao, Wang Yuandi, Li Guolin and others who were hiding in the laboratory of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's Iron Smelting Plant, and they have been sentenced to death and imprisonment by the People's Court respectively.

Luan Xiaochen went to Benxi Iron and Steel Company from Andong in July 1949 under a false name to look for a job and was hired as a "student of engineering with a clean background and history." He was assigned to work as a casting machine worker in the iron plant. Seven months later, the iron plant openly established a Party organization, and Luan Xiaochen concealed his history and sneaked into the Party. Soon after, the iron plant promoted cadres from among the workers, and again looked upon him as "active and capable," promoting him to the position of organization secretary of the Party General Branch (later changed to Party Committee). In fact, he was doing secretarial work, and the work summary of the General Branch was written by Luan Xiaochen according to the instructions of the General Branch Secretary. He could see the cadre file cards, and even privately affixed the seal of the Party Committee to find work for his father (but was not employed because of his advanced age). But soon, his true colors were revealed. It turned out that this "student with a clean history" was originally named Luan Shulun, from a rich peasant family, and had been a lieutenant officer in Chiang Kai-shek's "Northeast Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief." After his true face was exposed, the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China expelled him from the Party.

In February 1951, Luan Xiaochen, who had been expelled from the Party, was transferred back to the iron plant. At this time, an incident had already occurred in the iron plant, in which Ma Enyou, a "Central Unification" secret agent who had also disguised himself as "active" and sneaked into the Party and became a branch secretary, was exposed by the masses and sentenced to death by the People's Court. The Party and administrative leaders of the iron plant had conducted self-criticism, but the facts proved that they had not really learned their lesson. When Luan Xiaochen returned to the iron plant, the leading cadres were not vigilant, and without any principle, they still thought that this cadre was "good" and "active and capable," and that the main reason for this cadre being expelled from the Party was that he had not explained the "family problem," and assigned him to the laboratory to work as a recorder and custodian of chemical reagents and instruments.

The laboratory was originally an important department of the iron plant, but it was not valued by the leadership, and the strength of the Party and administrative leadership was very weak. In this laboratory, there were originally Chiang Kai-shek's construction army platoon leader Yuan Hongtao, who was posing as a trainee technician, Chiang Kai-shek's policeman Li Guolin, and hooligan soldier Wang Yuandi, and now there was another Chiang Kai-shek's lieutenant Luan Xiaochen. However, the leadership was not vigilant about this situation and turned a blind eye to it.

As soon as Luan Xiaochen entered the laboratory, he tried his best to pretend to be "active," making some achievements on the surface; on the other hand, he colluded with Yuan Hongtao and others to form a counter-revolutionary organization called "China Civil Administration Party," plotting to subvert the people's government. Luan Xiaochen was in charge of the warehouse accounts, so Yuan Hongtao wrote a slip to collect materials, and Li and Wang helped to transport them. Under the guise of "work," they easily stole various highly toxic drugs from the warehouse, and also stole boxes of imported chemical instruments. The entire laboratory had only two fixed-flow devices, but they stole one of them. After stealing the chemical reagents and instruments, Yuan Hongtao tried to make explosives of more than 200 cubic centimeters at home, and brought them to the laboratory to test and show to Luan, Wang, Li and others, proving that the trial production was successful. Several counter-revolutionaries also experimented with explosives several times in the gully under Pingdingshan. Later, Yuan Hongtao also tried to make pen pistols and ammunition. Luan Xiaochen also secretly read personnel materials to find targets for developing the counter-revolutionary organization. Sometimes they even openly read books on explosives, radio science, and other subjects in the laboratory.

Luan Xiaochen carried out his activities wildly for more than a year. By the end of 1952, after the reorganization of the laboratory, he became even more "active" in his work, and he was even more "active" when leading cadres were present. The new leading cadres had a "very good impression" of him, and thought that he was "capable" and could be relied upon more. But did this evil counter-revolutionary really not reveal any clues? No, he did. Here are three examples.

First: Luan Xiaochen was in charge of sampling test materials. Every day when the test materials came, he had to take a few bags from the more than 100 bags of test materials, and divide the test materials in each bag into two bags, and send them to everyone for testing, in order to measure the accuracy of the test. If the same test material yielded two different conclusions due to being divided into two bags, it would indicate that the test results were unreliable, and the entire batch of test materials would have to be reworked and retested. For a period of time, the phenomenon of rework of test materials in the laboratory was very serious. Batches and batches of materials were often reworked due to different test results, wasting manpower, material resources, and time. The technicians were very depressed because of the frequent errors. Later, it was found that Luan Xiaochen had "wrongly" put the test materials into the bags. How could the same test results be obtained from materials that were not the same? The technicians went to tell the director of the laboratory (who has now been transferred), but the leading cadres still thought that the technicians had misread the materials and believed that Luan Xiaochen would not make mistakes. It was not until the technicians caught him red-handed that Luan Xiaochen admitted that he had "made a mistake."

Second: Although the warehouse of the company's laboratory after the reorganization was not managed by Luan Xiaochen, because there was no quota for the consumption of chemical reagents, Luan and others took the opportunity to steal some reagents when no one was around after others had received them and not used them up. They continued to steal reagents from the laboratory in this way. Once, when the laboratory moved from Gongyuan to Benxi, Luan and others took the opportunity to steal 1,000 cubic centimeters of a certain highly toxic chemical reagent. Although someone saw three bottles of this reagent placed on the windowsill at that time, they thought that someone had randomly thrown the reagent there, and left it there casually. The next day, the three bottles of reagent disappeared. When asked in the group, no one in the group knew, and no one asked any further questions.

Third: After the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, Luan Xiaochen openly stole the seal of the laboratory's trade union and bought 400 kilograms of rice from the grain company, and shared it with Yuan, Wang, Li and other criminals.

Aren't these all suspicious warning signs? But the leadership still appreciated his "active and proactive work" and "talent," and even rated him as an "advanced worker." At the end of the year, they wanted to rate him as a model worker, but this proposal was not passed because someone objected. The leadership felt bad about it, and finally gave Luan Xiaochen a verbal commendation at the year-end awards ceremony for model workers.

After Luan Xiaochen's criminal activities were reported by the masses and uncovered by the Benxi City Public Security Bureau, most people in the laboratory felt that it was "unexpected." When the Public Security Bureau went to the laboratory to check the stolen drugs, the leadership even claimed that there were only 2,000 cubic centimeters of a certain highly toxic chemical reagent in the laboratory, and that nothing was lost. The accounts of other drugs were also impossible to check, and it was unclear whether anything was lost or how much was lost. It was not until they saw the many toxic and highly toxic chemical reagents seized by the Public Security Bureau that they were shocked and began to inventory the stocks and rectify the management system. The Benxi Iron and Steel Company also began to pay attention to strengthening the cadre force in the laboratory.

Counter-revolutionary elements cannot escape the people's net. The conspiracy of Luan Xiaochen and others was finally completely defeated. But isn't this an important lesson for us? Things like stealing drugs and then experimenting with explosives in the people's laboratory to prepare to blow up the people's factories; counter-revolutionary elements becoming "advanced workers" - are these things tolerable? If the relevant leading cadres before and after had been even slightly vigilant, and the bureaucratic style had not been so deeply ingrained, wouldn't these things have been completely avoidable?

    反革命组织为什么能长期潜藏在本溪炼铁厂化验室？
    程维君
    本溪市公安局破获了潜藏在本溪钢铁公司炼铁厂化验室的反革命罪犯栾孝忱、袁洪涛、王远迪、李国林等人，并已分别由人民法院判处了死刑和徒刑。
    栾孝忱是在一九四九年七月化名从安东跑到本溪钢铁公司找工作，被当作一个“出身历史清白的工科学生”录用的。他被分配在铁厂当铸铣机工人。七个月后，铁厂公开建党，栾孝忱又隐瞒历史混进党内来。不久，铁厂从工人中提拔干部，又看中他“积极能干”，把他提拔到党总支（后改党委）当组织干事。实际上他是干着秘书工作，总支的工作总结都是根据总支书记授意，由栾孝忱执笔写的。他可以看到干部材料的卡片，甚至私自盖上党委会的章为他父亲找工作（后因年龄过大，未用）。但不久，他的狐狸尾巴就露出来了。原来这个“历史清白的学生”本名栾树伦，富农家庭出身，过去是蒋匪“东北行辕长官司令部”中尉军官。他的本来面目被揭穿后，中共本溪市委便把他开除出党。
    一九五一年二月，被开除出党的栾孝忱又调回铁厂。这时铁厂已发生了一件事，也是伪装工作“积极”而混进党内并当了支部书记的“中统”特务马恩友被群众检举，经人民法院判处了死刑。铁厂的党和行政负责人曾进行检讨，但事实证明他们并没有真正接受教训。栾孝忱回到铁厂，领导干部不加警惕，毫无原则地仍然认为这个干部“不错”、“积极肯干”，认为这个干部被开除党籍主要是因为“家庭问题”没能交代，而把他分配到化验室去作记录员兼保管化学药品和仪器。
    化验室原是铁厂的一个重要部门，但没有受到领导的重视，党和行政的领导力量都很弱。在这个化验室里，原来就有混充见习技术员的蒋匪建军排长袁洪涛、蒋匪警察李国林、流氓兵痞王远迪等，现在又来了一个蒋匪中尉栾孝忱。但是领导上对于这种情况毫无警惕，熟视无睹。
    栾孝忱钻进了化验室，就一面竭力假装“积极”，表面上做出一些成绩；一面勾结袁洪涛等人成立反革命组织“中国民政党”，阴谋颠覆人民政权。栾孝忱掌握着仓库的账目，袁洪涛便打了条子前来领取，又有李、王两人帮助转运，他们以“工作”为掩护毫不费力地便从仓库中偷出各种烈性药品，又偷出成盒的进口化学仪器，全化验室仅有两个定流装置，竟也被他们偷去了一个。偷得化学药品和仪器后，袁洪涛在家中试制成炸药二百余公分，又拿到化验室来试验给栾、王、李等观看，证明试造已经成功。几个反革命分子并在平顶山下的山沟里试验了几次炸药。以后袁洪涛又试造钢笔手枪和弹药。栾孝忱还偷看人事材料，物色发展反革命组织的对象。他们有时并在化验室中公开阅读关于炸药、无线电学等书籍。
    栾孝忱猖狂地活动了一年多。到了一九五二年末，化验室改组后，他工作更加“积极”了，而且越是当着领导干部的面就越“积极”。新的领导干部对他又是“印象很好”，认为“有工作能力”，可以更多地依靠他。但这个罪恶的反革命分子，真是一点马脚不露吗？不是的。这里可以举出三件事。
    第一件：栾孝忱管抽查试料的工作，每天化验材料一来，他要从这一批装试料的一百多个口袋中，取出几个口袋，将每个口袋中的试料分装成两个口袋，发给大家化验，以衡量化验的准确程度。如果同一试料因分装两个口袋而得出两种结论，那就说明化验的结果是不可靠的，这一批试料得全部返工重新化验。有一个时期，化验室试料返工的现象非常严重，常因化验结果不一样而成批成批地返工浪费人力、物力、时间，技术人员因老出错，情绪苦闷万分。后来发现是栾孝忱把试料“装错”了口袋。试问本来不是一样的材料，怎么能得出一样的化验结果呢？技术人员跑去告诉化验室主任
  （现已调走），领导干部还认为是技术人员看错了，相信栾孝忱不会错。直到技术人员抓住了把柄，栾孝忱才承认是“弄错了”。
    第二件：改组后的公司化验室仓库虽然不由栾孝忱管理，但因为化学药品的消耗没有定额，别人领来后没用完，栾犯等就乘无人时窃取一些。他们用这种办法继续偷取化验室的药品。有一回化验室从工源往本溪搬家，栾犯等乘机偷了一千公撮某种烈性化学药品。当时虽有人看到窗台上放着三瓶这种药品，只以为是谁把药品乱扔，随便放在那儿的，到第二天，那三瓶药便不见了。问小组，小组内也没人知道，便再也没有人追问了。
    第三件：国家对粮食实行统购统销后，栾孝忱公然窃用化验室工会的印章，到粮食公司买了四百斤大米，和袁、王、李等犯共分。
    这些，难道不都是一些形迹可疑的警号吗？但是领导上却还在赏识他“工作主动积极”、“有才干”，竟把他评为“先进工作者”，到年终又要评他为模范，这个提议后因有人反对而没有通过。领导上觉得不过意，到底在年终奖励模范大会上给栾孝忱以口头表扬。
    栾孝忱的罪恶活动被群众检举，经本溪市公安局破获后，化验室绝大部分人都觉得“出乎意料之外”。公安局去化验室查对偷盗的药品时，领导上还声称某种烈性化学药品在化验室一共只有二千公撮，没有丢失。其他药品也是查账也无从查起，弄不清楚究竟丢没丢或丢了多少。及至看到了公安局起出的许许多多毒性、烈性化学药剂后，才在震惊之余，清点库存物资、整顿管理制度。本溪钢铁公司也才开始注意充实化验室的干部力量。
    反革命分子是逃不脱人民法网的。栾孝忱等人的阴谋终于被彻底击垮。但这件事对于我们不是一件重要的教训吗？像偷盗了药品之后又在人民的化验室内试验准备炸毁人民工厂的炸药；反革命分子成了“先进工作者”，这些事情难道是可以容忍的么？如果前后有关的领导干部稍为有一点点警惕性，官僚主义习气还不太深，这些事情难道是完全不可避免的么？
