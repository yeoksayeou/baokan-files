Ministry of Textile Industry Completes Basic Construction Plan for Next Year

The Ministry of Textile Industry has completed the basic construction plan for 1955.

Next year, the Ministry of Textile Industry will have nineteen new construction projects, including cotton textile mills, printing and dyeing mills, silk filature factories, tire cord factories, flax raw material plants, and textile joint hospitals. These projects are large in scale and complex in variety. In order to achieve the requirements of saving investment and formulating a realistic basic construction plan, the Ministry of Textile Industry recently convened a meeting of the heads of new construction units and planning personnel from various regions to focus on discussing the preparation of the plan. After more than 20 days of meetings, and after relevant comrades from the ministry went deep into various units to understand the situation, conducted mutual comparisons, and made detailed calculations, they overcame various conservative ideas and formulated a more realistic basic construction plan. Judging from the proportion of investment in this plan, under the condition that the tasks remain unchanged, the finally approved figures are 1% less than the figures of the first preliminary review in terms of reduced state investment. If we compare the four key factories of next year with the four key factories of this year, their scale and some conditions are basically the same, but the investment amount is reduced by 8%.

    纺织工业部明年基本建设计划编制完成
    纺织工业部一九五五年的基本建设计划已经编制完成。
    明年，纺织工业部有棉纺织厂、印染厂、缫丝厂、帘子布厂、亚麻原料厂、纺织联合医院等十九个新建单位。这些工程规模巨大，种类复杂。为了能达到节约投资，实事求是地编制出基本建设计划的要求，纺织工业部最近召集各地区新建单位负责人和计划人员开会，集中讨论编制计划问题。经过二十多天的会议，和部里有关同志深入各单位了解的情况，进行了相互比较和算细账之后，克服了各种保守思想，制订出了比较切合实际的基本建设计划。从这次计划投资额的比例来看，在任务不变的情况下，最后审定的数字与第一次初审的数字比较，减少了国家投资百分之一；如以明年四个重点厂和今年四个重点厂作比较，它们的规模和有些条件基本上相同，而在投资额上却减少了百分之八。
