Social Labor Under the Socialist System
—Chapter 30 of "Political Economy Textbook"

    The Nature of Labor Under Socialism. The Principle of Material Interest
    The establishment of socialist relations of production signifies a fundamental change in the nature of labor. Under the socialist system, labor is labor free from exploitation. "For thousands of years, people have been working for others, toiling for exploiters. For the first time, it is possible to work for oneself, relying on all the latest achievements of technology and culture." [1]
    In the capitalist system, forced labor is directly manifested as private labor, while in the socialist system, labor has direct social character. Public ownership of the means of production creates the possibility and necessity of organizing labor in a planned way within the whole society.
    The social status of workers has fundamentally changed. In capitalist society, a person's status is determined by social origin and property, whereas in socialist society, a person's status is determined only by labor and individual ability.
    The elimination of exploitation and the change in the social status of workers have led to a fundamental shift in people's view of labor, giving rise to a new attitude toward labor. For thousands of years, the system of exploitation has caused countless generations of workers to abhor labor, viewing it as a heavy and shameful burden, while socialism has transformed labor into something glorious, respectable, and heroic, endowing it with more and more creativity. In socialist society, a worker who does a good job and demonstrates initiative in improving production will gain honor and glory.
    However, under the socialist system, labor has not yet become the primary need of the lives of social members, nor has it become a habit of working for the common good. In the socialist stage, the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness have not been completely overcome. The vast majority of workers faithfully fulfill their obligations to society and demonstrate creative initiative in their work, but there are also some workers who do not honestly fulfill their obligations and violate labor discipline. These people try to give as little as possible to socialist society while taking as much as possible.
    Under the socialist system, there are still many remnants of the old division of labor—significant differences between mental and manual labor, between the labor of workers and peasants, and between skilled and unskilled labor. These remnants of the old division of labor can only be gradually eliminated with the development of socialist productive forces and the establishment of the material and technical base of communism.
    All of this demonstrates that under the socialist system, the principle of workers being materially interested in the results of their labor and the development of production is of great importance. Ensuring this concern is the fact that the worker's status in society is determined by the results of his labor and the results of his productive activities.
    The principle of each worker being materially interested in the results of labor is one of the fundamental principles of socialist management. Lenin pointed out: "It is necessary to build all major sectors of the national economy on the basis of concern for personal interests." [2]
    The principle of material interest is most widely applied in paying wages to employees, distributing income in collective farms, organizing economic accounting, and setting prices for industrial and agricultural products.
    All of this creates the necessity for "the strictest supervision by society and the state over the measure of labor and the measure of consumption." [3] Socialist society supervises people's participation in labor, takes into account the differences in the skill levels of workers, sets labor quotas, and determines the remuneration of each worker. When labor has not yet become a natural need for the vast majority of social members, the task of the socialist state is to organize social labor so that those who work more and better receive more social labor products.
    Labor is the obligation of members of socialist society. The realization of the right to work
    Socialism and labor are inseparable. Socialism eliminates the striking contradictions of the capitalist system, where the upper layer of exploiters lives a parasitic life, while the working masses bear intolerable labor, interrupted only during periods of unemployment and forced idleness. Socialism eliminates the capitalist ownership of the means of production, thereby eliminating the conditions under which one class (those who own the means of production) can live off the labor of another class (those who are deprived of the means of production). The establishment of public ownership of the means of production means that all citizens have an equal obligation to participate in social labor, because under the socialist system, a person can only survive by labor. In the Soviet Union, labor is the obligation and glorious cause of every able-bodied citizen.
    For the first time in human history, the socialist system not only realizes the equal obligation of all able-bodied citizens to engage in labor, but also realizes the equal right to work for all citizens. Thus, under the socialist system, the centuries-old dream of the working masses is realized. The right to work is determined by public ownership of the means of production, because public ownership of the means of production makes it possible for all citizens to work on public land and in public factories. The right to work means that every able-bodied member of society has the right to obtain guaranteed employment and to receive remuneration according to the quantity and quality of their labor. The right to work, which is legally enshrined in the Soviet Constitution, is effectively guaranteed by the socialist organization of the national economy, the continuous growth of social productive forces, the elimination of the possibility of economic crises, and the elimination of unemployment.
    Unemployment, the disaster of workers under the capitalist system, has been eliminated forever in the Soviet Union. Therefore, workers are not in danger of being thrown out of the enterprise at any time and losing all means of livelihood. The elimination of unemployment, the elimination of workers' doubts about the future, and the elimination of poverty in the countryside are great achievements of the Soviet people.
    The realization of the right to work makes it possible to more widely utilize social labor resources to develop production. The continuous improvement of production under the socialist system inevitably leads to a continuous increase in the number of workers and staff.
    The number of workers and staff in the Soviet national economy: 10.8 million at the end of 1928, 22.8 million at the end of 1932, 27 million at the end of 1937, 31.5 million at the end of 1940, and 44.8 million at the end of 1953.
    The elimination of unemployment in cities, the elimination of surplus agricultural population and poverty in the countryside, and the continuous growth of socialist production have fundamentally changed the conditions for ensuring enterprises obtain labor. Under the capitalist system, the demand for labor is spontaneously met by relying on the reserve army of the unemployed and the surplus agricultural population. Under the socialist system, the labor force required by enterprises is guaranteed in a planned way by relying on the organized recruitment, organized training, and allocation of labor.
    Capitalism turns workers into appendages of machines, stifling people's talents. In contrast, socialism liberates labor from exploitation, making education accessible to all citizens, which creates the necessary conditions for the development and free expression of workers' talents.
    The continuous growth of socialist production on a high technical basis requires the continuous improvement of the cultural and technical level of workers, and requires an increase in the proportion of skilled workers in various sectors of the national economy.
    Under the socialist system, the growth of workers' cultural and technical level is primarily guaranteed by the development of national education. In the Soviet Union, seven-year universal compulsory education has been achieved, and the transition to secondary (ten-year) universal compulsory education is underway. Specialized secondary and higher education has been widely developed. As a result, the cultural face of the working class and peasants has changed. Illiteracy and ignorance have become a thing of the past. The proportion of workers and collective farm members who have received seven-year education and secondary education is increasing.
    The cultural and technical level of workers is also improved through production technology education, which includes both training new workers and improving the skills of workers without leaving production. In the Soviet Union, in order to meet the needs of crucial sectors of the national economy for skilled workers, a state labor reserve system has been established, with a network of craft schools, railway schools, and factory apprentice schools. The students of these schools are provided for by the state during their studies. In addition to the state labor reserve system, an important source of supplementing skilled workers is the large-scale production training of workers, which trains millions of workers in enterprises through apprenticeships and training classes. The number of intellectuals and the number of experts of worker-peasant origin with advanced technology are rapidly increasing.
    In thirteen years (from 1941 to 1953), craft schools, railway schools, and factory apprentice schools, with the help of the state, trained nearly seven million young skilled workers in various trades. In the first three years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, an average of 2.5 million new skilled workers were trained each year through apprenticeships and training classes in enterprises, and nearly 3.5 million workers improved their skills. In the first three years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, more than 2.5 million collective farm members studied in three-year agronomy and animal husbandry training classes each year. Correspondence education for workers and collective farm members has also been widely developed.
    Distribution According to Labor—The Economic Law of Socialism
    The socialist mode of production determines the form of distribution that corresponds to it. Engels wrote of socialist society: "Since distribution is governed by purely economic reasons, it will be regulated by the interests of production, and that mode of distribution which enables all members of society to develop, maintain, and express their abilities as comprehensively as possible will best promote the development of production." [4] Under the socialist system, distribution according to labor best meets this requirement.
    In the first stage of communism, productive forces have not yet reached a high level of development to ensure the distribution of abundant products according to need. Therefore, the only possible and necessary method of distributing material goods is distribution according to labor. Distribution according to labor ensures that each worker is personally and materially interested in the results of his labor, and it is a powerful force for promoting the development of production. Distribution according to labor stimulates the improvement of labor productivity, while increasing the welfare of productive workers.
    Distribution according to labor makes the social labor products obtained by each worker directly dependent on the extent of his participation in social production, thereby linking the interests of the individual worker with the interests of the entire country.
    Distribution according to labor creates the need for a strict calculation of the differences between skilled and unskilled labor. Skilled labor is paid more, so that skilled workers receive what they deserve, while encouraging unskilled workers to improve and become skilled workers. This stimulates the improvement of workers' cultural and technical level and gradually eliminates the significant differences between mental and manual labor.
    Distribution according to labor promotes the elimination of labor force mobility and the formation of a fixed backbone, which is of great significance for improving the labor organization of enterprises. There can be no smooth development of socialist production without fixed workers who have mastered technology and accumulated production experience.
    It can be seen that distribution according to labor is an objective necessity and an economic law of socialism.
    The economic law of distribution according to labor requires that the distribution of products be directly dependent on the quantity and quality of each worker's labor, and requires that citizens of socialist society be treated equally for equal work, regardless of gender, age, race, and nationality. In industry and agriculture, labor remuneration is based on the requirements of this law.
    The economic law of distribution according to labor has been realized by the Communist Party and the Soviet state in a resolute struggle against the selfish tendencies of backward elements and against the petty-bourgeois egalitarianism. Petty-bourgeois egalitarianism advocates paying average labor remuneration regardless of the quantity and quality of labor, regardless of the skill level and labor productivity of workers; egalitarianism is a petty-bourgeois socialist idea that believes that socialism means that consumption, living conditions, tastes, and needs are universally the same. It brings great harm to production, causing the mobility of backbone workers, reducing labor productivity, and making it impossible to complete plans. Lenin, in exposing the petty-bourgeois socialist concept, elucidated the Marxist view of equality. The equality understood by Marxism is not the equality of physical and intellectual strength, but the economic equality of society. For socialism, this means that everyone is equally free from private ownership of the means of production and exploitation, everyone works equally with public means of production, everyone has an equal obligation to engage in labor, and the principle of distribution according to labor is the same for everyone.
    Socialist Labor Cooperation
    Socialism marks a new stage in the historical development of labor cooperation, which is higher than all previous forms. Socialist labor cooperation is the cooperation between workers who are free from exploitation and linked by relations of comradely cooperation and mutual assistance, and it is based on the most advanced technology. Socialist cooperation creates labor productivity that is incomparably stronger than capitalist cooperation. The ways inherent in cooperation to improve social labor productivity—implementing the division of labor, adopting machine technology, and saving means of production through common use—are maximized under socialist conditions.
    In contrast to the private ownership of the means of production, which limits the scale of labor cooperation, public ownership of the means of production greatly expands the scope of labor cooperation, making it possible for many people to engage in joint labor on a scale that capitalism cannot achieve. This is manifested in the concentration of production in industry and agriculture reaching a degree that capitalism has never had, and in the implementation of major national economic measures.
    Socialist cooperation has a new labor discipline that is fundamentally different from all previous social forms. The social labor organization of capitalism is maintained by the discipline of hunger. Under the capitalist system, the vast working masses are ignorant, oppressed, and exploited wage slaves or impoverished peasants exploited by a small number of capitalists and landlords. Socialist labor discipline is the conscious, comradely discipline of workers who are masters of their own country. Under the socialist system, maintaining the necessary labor discipline is in line with the fundamental interests of the working masses. Educating workers in the spirit of socialist labor discipline is one of the most important tasks of the socialist state.
    Any joint labor of the majority of workers requires management in order to coordinate the actions of these workers and organize the necessary production connections between them. Socialist labor cooperation is premised on the steadfast implementation of the system of one-man management in all links of production and management institutions. The system of one-man management is a method of managing socialist state-owned enterprises, which is based on the subordination of the masses to the sole will of the director of the labor process, and it is combined with the broad creative initiative of the masses in the production process.
    With the elimination of capitalist exploitation, the administrative tyranny that is inseparable from it is also eliminated. This tyranny means that capital dominates everything, enterprise owners and their management institutions act arbitrarily, and the working masses have no rights. In socialist society, the leaders of enterprises, companies, and management bureaus, and the ministers of various departments, are trustees and servants of the people and the socialist state. Under the capitalist system, the people treat the leaders of economic work—managers, factory directors, workshop directors, and foremen—as enemies, because they lead the economy for the benefit of capitalists and for capitalist profits. Under the socialist system, the leaders of economic work are trusted by the people, because they manage the economy not for the profits of capitalists, but for the benefit of all the people.
    The elimination of exploitation fundamentally changes the relationship between mental and manual workers. The conflict of interests between workers and enterprise leaders that is characteristic of capitalism disappears. In socialist society, manual workers and enterprise leaders are members of a unified production collective, and they all have a vested interest in the development and improvement of production. This gives rise to the creative cooperation between manual and mental workers, which aims to continuously improve production.
    Under the capitalist system, the labor of workers increasingly loses its spiritual content, and the gap between mental and manual labor deepens. In socialist society, the spiritual content of manual labor is increasingly enriched, and manual and mental labor are becoming increasingly closer, and the significant differences between them are gradually eliminated. This is manifested in the continuous improvement of the cultural and technical level of the working class and peasants, and in the increasing development of socialist competition, which constitutes the most important characteristic of socialist labor cooperation.
    Socialist Competition
    Socialist competition is a method of improving labor productivity and improving production on the basis of maximizing the initiative of the working masses. Lenin pointed out that socialism for the first time creates the possibility of implementing truly broad, large-scale competition that includes millions of working masses. Socialist competition aims to complete and overfulfill national economic plans and ensure the continuous growth of socialist production.
    Socialist competition is fundamentally different from the competition that dominates bourgeois society.
    "The principle of competition is: the failure and death of some, and the victory and rule of others.
    The principle of socialist competition is: the advanced give comradely assistance to the backward, thereby achieving universal improvement.
    Competition is: defeating the backward to establish one's own rule.
    Socialist competition is: some people work badly, others work well, and still others work even better—catch up with the better to achieve universal improvement." [5]
    Socialist competition demonstrates the comradely cooperation of workers and their common struggle for the universal improvement of production.
    Instead of the pursuit of profit and competition as the driving force of production, socialism generates new, infinitely powerful driving forces. The first is the masses' deep concern for the development of social production, which stems from the basic economic law of socialism. The fact that under the socialist system, people do not work for exploiters, but for themselves and for their society, is an inexhaustible source of socialist production upsurge. Distribution according to labor plays a huge role in the development of socialist competition. Remuneration according to labor makes the worker's remuneration dependent on the quantity and quality of his labor, thereby stimulating the masses to exert their creative initiative in the production process.
    The innovations and initiatives of production innovators and advanced workers are the characteristics of competition. They fully master advanced technology, abandon outdated quotas and work methods, and propose new quotas and work methods. Many workers not only master basic technology, but also have the level of technical personnel. In the struggle against everything old and outdated, advanced figures are opening up new paths for developing production and tapping new potential for improving labor productivity.
    The creative initiative of workers does not stagnate production, it is the source of continuous advancement and improvement of production. The advanced working methods applied by innovators are based on fundamentally improving labor organization (division of labor, concurrent jobs, etc.), production organization (working according to instructions and charts), technical operation processes, and production technology (strengthening technical operation processes, improving tools, equipment, and machine tools, etc.). Advanced figures in agriculture apply new farming methods and new animal husbandry methods, increasing crop yields and livestock production.
    Socialist competition is premised on the rapid and widespread dissemination of advanced experience. Under the socialist system, the power of example for the first time produces a widespread influence and becomes a means of continuous upsurge and continuous improvement of production. This is possible because: first, innovators give active comradely assistance to all production workers in mastering advanced labor methods in various forms (apprenticeships, old workers helping new workers, establishing schools for production advanced workers and innovators, etc.); second, the working masses have a desire to catch up with advanced figures and master their experience to achieve universal improvement; third, the broad openness of competition and the comparison of enterprise work results are guaranteed. State economic organs, relying on the advanced experience of production innovators, determine advanced quotas for labor consumption and utilization of means of production, and use these quotas as the basis for production plans. The dissemination of advanced experience and the mastery of new quotas and work methods by the majority of workers ensure that labor productivity reaches a new and higher level.
    The Communist Party and the Soviet state lead the socialist competition of the masses and give it full support. Workers are not only materially encouraged for their achievements in work, but also receive medals and awards, and outstanding innovation activities are also awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor and the Stalin Prize.
    In the Soviet Union, socialist competition has a national character. The most common and effective forms of competition in enterprises are individual competition and team competition. In addition, competitions are launched between workshops, enterprises, collective farms, agricultural machinery stations, state farms, and between districts, provinces, and republics. Competitions are widely launched everywhere to strive for excellent product quality, better utilization of production capacity, reduced product costs, extra-plan savings of materials and funds, and to strive for bumper harvests of crops and high yields in animal husbandry. In 1953, more than 90 percent of workers in industry participated in socialist competition. In 1953, more than 850,000 inventions, technical reforms, and rationalization proposals adopted in industry, construction, and transportation.
    Socialist competition in cities and villages is of paramount importance for developing the socialist economy and for building communism.
    The Continuous Growth of Labor Productivity—The Economic Law of Socialism
    Continuously improving labor productivity is the most important condition for building communism. Lenin wrote: "Labor productivity is, in the final analysis, the most important and principal thing for ensuring the victory of the new social system. Capitalism created a labor productivity that did not exist under the serf system. Capitalism can be completely defeated, and it will certainly be completely defeated, because socialism can create a new and much higher labor productivity." [6]
    As everyone knows, labor productivity is measured by the number of products manufactured by a worker in a unit of time or by the labor time used for a unit of product. The improvement of labor productivity is manifested in the reduction of the share of living labor in products, while the share of past labor relatively increases, and at the same time, the total amount of labor contained in a unit of product also decreases. The growth of labor productivity means the increase in the amount of product in a unit of labor time.
    From a social point of view, labor productivity grows with the savings of labor, which includes the savings of both living labor and materialized labor of the entire society. Marx pointed out that the real saving is the saving of labor time, and this saving is the same as the development of labor productivity. Socialism eliminates the large amount of wasted labor inherent in the anarchic capitalist system and guarantees the planned and most rational utilization of social means of production and labor resources. Soviet workers are all concerned about saving means of production as much as possible, which is manifested in the mass movement to save raw materials, fuel, materials, and to better utilize machines and equipment.
    The necessity of continuously and rapidly improving labor productivity is determined by the basic economic law of socialism. The continuous growth of socialist production is achieved, first, by increasing the labor productivity of each worker (increasing output). During the period from 1940 to 1953, about 70 percent of the increase in industrial products came from this source. The continuous growth of socialist production is achieved, second, by increasing the total number of employed workers and by improving the utilization of labor (living labor and materialized labor) throughout society. Increasing the proportion of workers engaged in material production and participating in the main production process by reducing administrative management institutions and reducing personnel engaged in auxiliary and supporting work is of great significance for the growth of social labor productivity.
    The continuous improvement of labor productivity guarantees the rapid growth of output and creates the possibility for the growth of consumption and the expansion of production.
    The growth of labor productivity is the most important condition for further developing the national economy, dramatically increasing the production of consumer goods, and most fully meeting the growing needs of the people. In order to surpass developed capitalist countries in the economic competition, it is necessary to continuously improve labor productivity. "All of us Soviet people, all of us people must clearly understand that the main and decisive condition for the further upsurge and comprehensive development of the national economy is to strive to improve labor productivity in all sectors—industry, transportation, and agriculture. We all should know that it is impossible to greatly and rapidly improve the welfare of the Soviet people without greatly and continuously improving labor productivity." [7]
    Due to the inherent contradictions of capitalism, the growth of labor productivity in bourgeois society is very slow and has an unstable nature. Marx pointed out: "For capital, the law of increasing labor productivity is not unconditionally applicable." [8] With the elimination of capitalist private ownership, all obstacles hindering the growth of labor productivity are also eliminated. Under the socialist system, what exists and functions is the economic law of the continuous growth of labor productivity.
    Socialism discovers paths and methods for improving labor productivity that capitalism cannot have.
    Under the socialist system, the growth of labor productivity is first guaranteed by the continuous development and consistent application of advanced technology that reduces human labor, while under the capitalist system, the growth of labor productivity is first achieved by the excessive intensification of labor that destroys workers' labor. The necessary conditions for the growth of labor productivity are: constantly improving technology, mechanizing and electrifying production, striving to improve the utilization of existing technology, and continuously fighting against anti-mechanization tendencies.
    The continuous improvement of the material welfare of workers and the improvement of their skill level and cultural and technical level are powerful factors in the growth of labor productivity.
    The socialist labor organization based on the conscious discipline and comradely cooperation of workers, and the payment of labor remuneration according to the quantity and quality of labor, create huge possibilities for the growth of labor productivity. The further improvement of distribution according to labor, the strengthening of socialist discipline and order in production, and the increase in the proportion of workers directly engaged in material production are huge potentials for the growth of labor productivity.
    Under the socialist system, giving play to the creative initiative of workers in improving technology and production organization, as demonstrated in socialist competition, is the driving force for the growth of labor productivity. Studying and disseminating the advanced experience accumulated by production innovators is of great significance for the growth of social labor productivity.
    The socialist economic system creates the necessity and possibility for the continuous growth of labor productivity.
    Labor productivity in Soviet industry increased by 41 percent during the First Five-Year Plan and by 82 percent during the Second Five-Year Plan. During the First Five-Year Plan, labor productivity increased by an average of 9 percent per year, and during the Second Five-Year Plan, it increased by an average of 12.7 percent per year. This growth rate of labor productivity does not exist in capitalist industry. Compared with the 1913 level, labor productivity in Soviet industry increased threefold in 1940, and with the shortening of the working day, it increased 4.2 times. In the post-war period, the further technical re-equipment of the national economy, the improvement of the skill level of workers and engineering and technical personnel, and the development of their creative initiative, all enabled a new growth in labor productivity. Compared with 1940, labor productivity in 1953 increased by 71 percent in industry and by 50 percent in construction.
    Industrial labor productivity has increased approximately fivefold in the last 25 years (1928-1953), and approximately 2.5 times in construction and railway transportation. In collective farms and state farms, labor productivity is approximately more than twice that of pre-revolutionary agricultural labor productivity.
    However, from the perspective of solving the task of maximizing the satisfaction of the growing needs of the people, and from the perspective of solving the task of surpassing advanced capitalist countries in the economic competition, the existing level of labor productivity in the Soviet Union is still insufficient. The Communist Party is mobilizing workers to fight for a large increase in labor productivity.
    Guaranteeing the continuous growth of labor productivity with abundant consumer goods is a necessary prerequisite for the transition from socialism to communism.
    Brief Conclusion
    (1) Socialism frees workers from exploitation and replaces forced labor for exploiters with free labor for themselves and for the whole society. Under the socialist system, labor is creative and is organized in a planned way throughout society. However, under the socialist system, labor has not yet become the primary need of people's lives, and it needs material incentives. Socialist society exercises extremely strict supervision over the amount of labor and the amount of remuneration for each worker.
    (2) In the Soviet Union, labor is the obligation of every able-bodied member of society and is a glorious cause. In the socialist national economic system, unemployment has been eliminated, and the right to work for all members of society has been realized. Under the socialist system, the continuous growth of production leads to the continuous increase in the number of employees and the improvement of their cultural and technical level.
    (3) The principle of each worker being materially interested in the results of his labor is one of the fundamental principles of socialist management. Under the socialist system, the economic law of distribution according to labor functions, which requires the distribution of material goods directly according to the quantity and quality of labor.
    (4) Socialist labor cooperation is the cooperation of workers who are free from exploitation and linked by relations of comradely cooperation. It is based on high technology, and its characteristics are conscious discipline and a new type of management that combines the system of one-man management with the broad development of the initiative and automony of the masses. The most important feature of socialist cooperation is socialist competition. Socialist competition is the driving force for the development of the socialist economy.
    (5) Socialism creates a social labor productivity that is higher than that of capitalism. The growth of labor productivity is a decisive condition for continuously improving socialist production and the welfare of the people. The continuous growth of labor productivity is the economic law of socialist social development.

    社会主义制度下的社会劳动
    ——“政治经济学教科书”第三十章
    社会主义制度下劳动的性质。物质利益的原则
    社会主义生产关系的确立意味着劳动性质的根本改变。在社会主义制度下，劳动是摆脱了剥削的劳动。“千百年来都是为别人劳动，为剥削者做苦工，现在第一次有可能为自己工作，而且是依靠最新技术和文化的一切成果来工作。”〔一〕
    在资本主义制度下强迫劳动直接表现为私人劳动，而在社会主义制度下劳动具有直接的社会性。生产资料公有制造成在全社会范围内有计划地组织劳动的可能性和必要性。
    劳动者在社会上的地位根本改变了。在资本主义社会中，人的地位是由社会出身和财产来决定的，与此相反，在社会主义社会中，人的地位只是由劳动和个人能力来决定的。
    剥削的消灭，劳动者在社会上的地位的改变，使人们对劳动的看法发生根本转变，产生了新的劳动态度。千百年来剥削制度使无数代的劳动者厌恶劳动，把它看做沉重的可耻的负担，而社会主义却把劳动变成光荣、体面和英勇的事情，使它具有愈来愈多的创造性。在社会主义社会中，一个劳动者如果工作做得好，在改进生产的事业上表现出主动性，他就会获得荣誉和光荣。
    但是，在社会主义制度下，劳动尚未成为社会成员的生活的第一需要，尚未变成为共同利益工作的习惯。在社会主义阶段上，人们意识中的资本主义残余尚未彻底克服。绝大多数工作者忠实地履行自己对社会的义务，在劳动中表现出创造主动性，但也有一些工作者不老老实实地对待自己的义务，破坏劳动纪律。这些人力图给社会主义社会尽可能少的东西，而取得尽可能多的东西。
    在社会主义制度下，还保存着不少旧的分工的残余——脑力劳动和体力劳动间、工人劳动和农民劳动间、熟练劳动和简单劳动间的重大差别。这些旧的分工的残余只能随着社会主义生产力的发展和共产主义物质生产基础的建立逐渐地被消灭。
    这一切说明，在社会主义制度下，工作者从物质利益上关心劳动的结果和生产的发展的原则具有十分重要的意义。保证这种关心的是工作者在社会上的地位以他的劳动结果、以他的生产活动结果为转移。
    每个工作者从物质利益上关心劳动结果的原则是社会主义经营的根本原则之一。列宁指出：“必须把国民经济的一切大的部门建立在个人利益的关心上面。”〔二〕
    在付给职工劳动报酬、分配集体农庄收入、组织经济核算、规定工业品和农产品价格等等的时候，物质利益的原则得到最广泛的应用。
    这一切就造成“社会和国家对劳动量和消费量实行极严格的监督”〔三〕的必要性。社会主义社会监督人们的参加劳动，考虑到工作者的熟练程度的差别，确定劳动定额和每个工作者的劳动报酬。当劳动尚未成为绝大多数社会成员的自然需要的时候，社会主义国家的任务就在于组织社会劳动，使工作得又多又好的人得到较多的社会劳动产品。
    劳动是社会主义社会成员的义务。劳动权利的实现
    社会主义和劳动是分不开的。社会主义消灭了资本主义制度的惊人的矛盾，在资本主义制度下，社会上层剥削分子过着寄生的生活，而工人群众则担负不堪忍受的劳动，只是在失业而被迫赋闲的时期才中断这种劳动。社会主义消灭了生产资料的资本家所有制，从而消灭了一个阶级（生产资料占有者）能够依靠另一个阶级（被剥夺生产资料的人们）的劳动过活的条件。生产资料公有制的建立意味着全体公民都有参加社会劳动的平等义务，因为在社会主义制度下一个人只有劳动才能生存。在苏联，劳动是每个有劳动能力的公民的义务和光荣的事情。
    社会主义制度第一次在人类历史上不仅实现了一切有劳动能力的公民从事劳动的平等义务，而且实现了一切公民的平等的劳动权利。从而在社会主义制度下实现了劳动群众千百年来的梦想。劳动权利是由生产资料公有制决定的，因为生产资料公有制使全体公民都有可能在公有的土地上和公有的工厂中进行工作。劳动权利就是每个有劳动能力的社会成员都有权利获得有保障的工作并按劳动数量和质量取得报酬。以立法手续在苏联宪法上固定下来的劳动权利，由于国民经济的社会主义组织、社会生产力的不断增长、经济危机的可能性的消除和失业的消灭而得到切实的保证。
    失业，这一资本主义制度下劳动者的灾难，在苏联已经永远消灭了，因此，工人没有随时被赶出企业大门而失去一切生活资料的危险。失业的消灭、工人对明天的怀疑心理的消除、农村中贫困的消灭是苏联人民的伟大成果。
    劳动权利的实现使得有可能更加广泛地利用社会劳动资源来发展生产。社会主义制度下生产的不断提高必然使工人和职员人数不断增加。
    苏联国民经济中的工人和职员人数：一九二八年年底为一千零八十万人，一九三二年年底为二千二百八十万人，一九三七年年底为二千七百万人，一九四○年年底为三千一百五十万人，一九五三年年底为四千四百八十万人。
    城市中的失业、农村中的农业人口过剩和贫困等现象的消灭，社会主义生产的不断增长，根本改变了保证企业获得劳动力的条件。在资本主义制度下，对劳动力的需求是自发地、依靠失业后备军和过剩农业人口来满足的。在社会主义制度下，企业所需的劳动力是有计划地、依靠有组织的招收、有组织的训练和分配劳动力来保证的。
    资本主义把工人变成机器的附属品，扼杀人们的才能，与此相反，社会主义把劳动从剥削下解放出来，使全体公民都可以受到教育，这就为劳动者的才能的发展和自由表现创造必要条件。
    社会主义生产在高度技术基础上的不断增长，要求不断提高劳动者的文化技术水平，要求增加国民经济各部门中熟练劳动者的比重。
    在社会主义制度下，劳动者的文化技术水平的增长，首先是由国民教育的发展来保证的。在苏联，已经实现了七年普遍义务教育，正在过渡到中等（十年）普遍义务教育。专业的中等和高等教育得到广泛的发展。因此，工人阶级和农民的文化面貌改变了。不识字和愚昧无知已成过去。受过七年教育和中等教育的人在工人和集体农庄庄员中所占的比重愈来愈大。
    劳动者的文化技术水平也通过生产技术教育而提高，这种教育既包括培养新的工作者，也包括在不脱离生产的情况下提高工作者的熟练程度。在苏联，为了满足国民经济中极重要的部门对熟练工人的需要，建立了拥有工艺学校、铁路学校和工厂艺徒学校网的国家劳动后备系统。这些学校的学生在学习期间一切由国家供给。除了国家劳动后备系统外，补充熟练工人的重要来源就是对工人进行大规模的生产训练，就是用带徒弟、开训练班的办法在企业中对千百万劳动者进行训练。知识分子的人数、有高等技术的工农出身的专家的人数，正在迅速增加。
    在十三年内（从一九四一年至一九五三年），工艺学校、铁路学校和工厂艺徒学校依靠国家的帮助训练了将近七百万各行各业的年轻的熟练工人。在第五个五年计划的头三年中，用企业中带徒弟和开训练班的办法，平均每年培养了二百五十万新的熟练工人，并且有将近三百五十万工人提高了自己的技术。在第五个五年计划的头三年中，每年有二百五十万以上的集体农庄庄员在三年制的农艺及动物饲养训练班学习。工人和集体农庄庄员的函授教育也有了广泛的发展。
    按劳分配——社会主义的经济法则
    社会主义生产方式决定着与其相适应的分配形式。恩格斯指社会主义社会写道：“分配既然是由纯粹的经济理由来支配，那末它将由生产的利益来调节，而那种能使社会全体成员尽可能全面地发展、保持和表现自己能力的分配方式，最能促进生产的发展。”〔四〕在社会主义制度下，按劳分配最适合于这一要求。
    在共产主义的第一阶段上，生产力还未达到保证按需要进行分配的丰富产品的高度发展水平。因此，唯一可能和必要的物质资料分配方式就是按劳分配。按劳分配保证每个工作者从个人物质利益上关心自己劳动的结果，它是推进生产发展的强大力量。按劳分配刺激劳动生产率的提高，同时增进生产工作者的福利。
    按劳分配使每个工作者取得的社会劳动产品直接以他参加社会生产的程度为转移，从而把工作者个人的利益和整个国家的利益联系起来。
    按劳分配造成严格计算熟练劳动和非熟练劳动间的差别的必要性。熟练劳动的报酬较高，使得熟练工作者得到应得之份，同时鼓励非熟练工人上进，成为熟练工人。这就刺激劳动者的文化技术水平的提高，并使脑力劳动和体力劳动间的重大差别逐渐消灭。
    按劳分配促进劳动力的流动性的消灭和固定基干的形成，这对改善企业的劳动组织有很大的意义。没有掌握了技术和积累了生产经验的固定的工作者，就不可能有社会主义生产的顺利发展。
    可见按劳分配是客观必然性，是社会主义的经济法则。
    按劳分配的经济法则要求产品的分配直接以每个工作者的劳动数量和质量为转移，要求对社会主义社会的公民，不分性别、年龄、种族和民族，一律实行同工同酬。在工业和农业中，劳动报酬是以这一法则的要求为基础的。
    按劳分配的经济法则是共产党和苏维埃国家在反对落后分子的自私倾向、反对小资产阶级的平均主义的坚决斗争中实现的。小资产阶级平均主义主张不管劳动数量和质量，不管工作者的熟练程度和劳动生产率，一律付给平均的劳动报酬；平均主义是一种小资产阶级的社会主义观念，它认为消费、生活条件、口味和需要都普遍一样就是社会主义。它给生产带来很大的损害，引起基干工人的流动，使劳动生产率降低，使计划不能完成。列宁在揭穿小资产阶级的社会主义观念时阐明了马克思主义的平等观。马克思主义所理解的平等不是体力和智力的平等，而是社会的经济的平等。对社会主义来说，这就是大家平等地摆脱了生产资料私有制和剥削，大家平等地用公有的生产资料进行工作，大家都平等地有从事劳动的义务，按劳取酬原则对大家都是一样的。
    社会主义的劳动协作
    社会主义标志着劳动协作历史发展上的比以前各种形态都高的新阶段。社会主义的劳动协作是不受剥削的、以同志的合作和互助关系联系起来的工作者之间的协作，它以最先进的技术为基础。社会主义协作创造出比资本主义协作强大得不可比拟的劳动生产力。协作所固有的提高社会劳动生产力的方式——实行分工，采用机器技术，生产资料由于共同使用而节省等等——在社会主义条件下得到最大的发展。
    与限制劳动协作规模的生产资料私有制相反，生产资料公有制大大扩展劳动协作的范围，使许多人在资本主义所不能达到的那种规模上进行共同劳动成为可能。这表现在工业和农业中的生产集中达到了资本主义从未有过的程度，表现在重大的全国性的经济措施的实现上。
    社会主义协作有着与以前一切社会形态根本不同的新的劳动纪律。资本主义的社会劳动组织是靠饥饿纪律来维持的，在资本主义制度下，广大劳动群众是愚昧无知、备受压制、备遭一小撮资本家和地主剥削的雇佣奴隶或贫困不堪的农民。社会主义劳动纪律是当了自己国家的主人的劳动者的自觉的、同志的纪律。在社会主义制度下，维持必要的劳动纪律是符合于劳动群众的根本利益的。以社会主义劳动纪律的精神教育劳动者是社会主义国家最重要的任务之一。
    多数工作者的任何一种共同劳动都需要管理，以使这些工作者的行动互相配合，并组织他们之间的必要的生产联系。社会主义的劳动协作是以在生产和管理机构的一切环节中坚定不移地实行一长制为前提的。一长制是社会主义国营企业的管理方法，它是以群众服从劳动过程指导者的唯一意志为基础的，它是与群众在生产过程中的广大的创造主动性相结合的。
    随着资本主义剥削的消灭，与它分不开的管理上的暴虐也消灭了，这种暴虐意味着资本主宰一切，企业主及其管理机构横行霸道，工人群众毫无权利。在社会主义社会中，企业、公司、管理总局的领导者和各部部长是人民和社会主义国家的受托者和勤务员。在资本主义制度下，人民对待经济工作的领导者——经理、厂长、车间主任和工长——像对待敌人一样，因为他们领导经济是为了资本家的利益，为了资本家的利润。在社会主义制度下，经济工作的领导者得到人民的信任，因为他们管理经济不是为了资本家的利润，而是为了全体人民的利益。
    剥削的消灭根本改变了脑力劳动者和体力劳动者之间的关系。资本主义所特有的工人和企业领导人员间的利益对立消失了。在社会主义制度下，体力劳动者和企业领导人员是统一的生产集体的成员，他们都与生产的发展和改进有切身的利益关系。由此就产生出旨在使生产不断完善的、体力劳动者和脑力劳动者间的创造性的合作。
    在资本主义制度下，工人的劳动日益失去精神内容，脑力劳动和体力劳动间的鸿沟愈来愈深；在社会主义社会中，体力劳动的精神内容日益丰富，体力劳动和脑力劳动愈来愈接近，它们之间的重大差别逐渐消灭。这表现在：工人阶级和农民的文化技术水平不断提高，构成社会主义劳动协作最重要的特征的社会主义竞赛日益发展。
    社会主义竞赛
    社会主义竞赛是在劳动群众发挥最大的积极性的基础上来提高劳动生产率和改进生产的方法。列宁指出，社会主义第一次创造了实行真正广泛的、大规模的、包括千百万劳动群众的竞赛的可能性。社会主义竞赛旨在完成和超额完成国民经济计划，保证社会主义生产的不断增长。
    社会主义竞赛根本不同于统治着资产阶级社会的竞争。
    “竞争的原则是：一些人的失败和死亡，另一些人的胜利和统治。
    社会主义竞赛的原则是：先进者给予落后者以同志的帮助，从而达到普遍的提高。
    竞争是：打败落后者以确立自己的统治。
    社会主义竞赛是：一些人工作得不好，另一些人工作得好，再有一些人工作得更好，——赶上更好的以达到普遍的提高。”〔五〕
    社会主义竞赛表现出劳动者进行同志的合作，表现出他们共同为生产的普遍提高而斗争。
    代替追逐利润和竞争这样的生产动力，社会主义产生出新的、无比强大的动力。这首先是群众对社会生产发展的深切的关心，这种关心是从社会主义基本经济法则中产生的。在社会主义制度下，人们不是为剥削者工作，而是为自己、为自己的社会工作，这个事实就是社会主义生产高涨的无穷无尽的泉源。按劳分配在社会主义竞赛的发展上起着巨大的作用。按劳取酬使工作者的报酬取决于他的劳动数量和质量，从而刺激群众在生产过程中发挥他们的创造主动性。
    生产革新者和先进者的创举是竞赛的特点，他们完全掌握了先进技术，抛弃了陈旧的过时的定额和工作方法，提出新的定额和工作方法。很多工人不仅掌握了起码的技术，并且具有技术人员的水平。在和一切旧的、过时的东西作斗争中，先进人物开辟着发展生产的新的道路，发掘出提高劳动生产率的新的潜力。
    劳动者的创造主动性不使生产停滞不前，它是生产不断前进和完善的泉源。革新者所应用的先进工作方法的基础就是根本改善劳动组织（分工、兼职等等）、生产组织（按指示图表工作）、技术操作过程和生产技术（技术操作过程的强化，工具、设备、机床的改善等等）。农业中的先进者应用新的农作法和新的动物饲养方法，提高了农作物的产量和畜产品的产量。
    社会主义竞赛以迅速而广泛地推广先进经验为前提。在社会主义制度下，范例的力量第一次产生出广泛的影响，成为生产不断高涨和不断完善的手段。这一点所以能做到，是由于：第一、革新者在掌握先进劳动方法上用各种形式（带徒弟，老工人帮助新手，开办生产先进者和革新者学校等等）给予一切生产工作者以积极的同志的帮助；第二、劳动群众具有赶上先进人物、掌握他们的经验以达到普遍提高的愿望；第三、保证了竞赛的广泛的公开性和对企业工作成绩的评比。国家经济机关依靠生产革新者的先进经验，确定劳动消耗和生产资料利用的先进定额，把这种定额作为生产计划的基础。先进经验的推广、大多数劳动者的掌握新的定额和工作方法，保证劳动生产率达到新的更高的水平。
    共产党和苏维埃国家领导群众的社会主义竞赛并予以全力支持。劳动者由于工作中的成就，不仅得到物质上的鼓励，而且得到勋章和奖章，由于杰出的革新活动更得到社会主义劳动英雄的称号和斯大林奖金。
    在苏联，社会主义竞赛具有全民的性质。企业中最普遍最有效的竞赛形式，是个人竞赛和队与队的竞赛。此外，还展开车间、企业、集体农庄、农业机器站、国营农场间的竞赛，以及区、省、共和国间的竞赛。到处广泛展开争取产品优良质量的竞赛，更好地利用生产能力的竞赛，降低产品成本的竞赛，超计划节约材料和资金的竞赛，争取农作物的丰收和畜牧业的高产量的竞赛。一九五三年工业中有百分之九十以上的工人参加了社会主义竞赛。一九五三年工业、建筑业和运输业中所采用的发明、技术改革和合理化建议在八十五万件以上。
    城市和乡村中的社会主义竞赛，对于发展社会主义经济，对于建成共产主义具有头等的意义。
    劳动生产率的不断增长——社会主义的经济法则
    不断提高劳动生产率是建设共产主义的最重要的条件。列宁写道：“劳动生产率，归根到底是保证新社会制度胜利的最重要最主要的东西。资本主义造成了在农奴制度下所没有过的劳动生产率。资本主义可以被彻底战胜，而且一定会被彻底战胜，是因为社会主义能造成新的高得多的劳动生产率。”〔六〕
    大家知道，劳动生产率是以工人在单位时间所制造的产品的数量或用于单位产品的劳动时间来测量的。劳动生产率的提高表现在产品中活劳动的份额减少，而过去劳动的份额相对增加，同时，包含在单位产品中的劳动总量也减少了。劳动生产率的增长意味着单位劳动时间中产品量的增加。
    从社会来看，劳动生产率是随着劳动的节约而增长的，这里包括整个社会的活劳动和物化劳动的节约。马克思指出，真正的节约在于劳动时间的节省，这种节省和劳动生产力的发展是一个东西。社会主义消灭了无政府式的资本主义体系所固有的大量浪费劳动的现象，保证有计划地、最合理地利用社会的生产资料和劳动资源。苏联的劳动者对尽量节约生产资料都很关心，这表现在节约原料、燃料、材料和更好地利用机器和装备的群众运动上。
    不断迅速提高劳动生产率的必要性是由社会主义基本经济法则决定的。社会主义生产的不断增长，第一是靠每个工作者的劳动生产率的提高（产量的增加）。在一九四○年至一九五三年期间，工业品增加量的百分之七十左右是靠这一泉源得来的。社会主义生产的不断增长，第二是靠就业工作者总数的增加以及在全社会范围内改善对劳动（活劳动和物化劳动）的利用。用缩减行政管理机构、缩减从事附属和辅助工作的人员的办法，来增加从事物质生产和参加主要生产过程的工作者的比重，对于社会劳动生产率的增长具有很大的意义。
    劳动生产率的不断提高保证产量的迅速增长，为消费的增长和生产的扩大创造可能性。
    劳动生产率的增长是进一步发展国民经济、急剧增加消费品生产和最充分地满足人民日益增长的需要的最重要的条件。为了在经济竞赛中胜过发达的资本主义国家，必须不断提高劳动生产率。“我们全体苏联人，我们全体人民必须清楚地了解到：国民经济进一步高涨和全面发展的主要的和决定性的条件，就是尽力提高所有部门——工业、运输业和农业部门——的劳动生产率。我们大家应该知道，不大大地和不断地提高劳动生产率，就不可能大量而迅速地增进苏联人民的福利。”〔七〕
    由于资本主义所固有的矛盾，在资产阶级社会中，劳动生产率的增长是很缓慢的，并且具有不稳定的性质。马克思指出：“对于资本，提高劳动生产力的法则并不是无条件适用的。”〔八〕随着资本主义私有制的消灭，一切阻碍劳动生产率增长的障碍也就消灭。在社会主义制度下，存在并起作用的是劳动生产率不断增长的经济法则。
    社会主义发现出资本主义所不能有的提高劳动生产率的途径和方法。
    在社会主义制度下，劳动生产率的增长首先是依靠不断发展和一贯运用减轻人的劳动的先进技术来保证的，而在资本主义制度下，劳动生产率首先是依靠摧残工人的劳动的过分强化来达到的。劳动生产率增长的必要条件是：经常改进技术，生产机械化、电气化，尽力改进对现有技术的利用，不断与反机械化的倾向作斗争。
    劳动者的物质福利的不断增进及其熟练程度和文化技术水平的提高，是劳动生产率增长的强大因素。
    以工作者的自觉纪律和同志合作为基础的社会主义劳动组织，以及按劳动数量和质量来支付劳动报酬，为劳动生产率的增长造成巨大的可能性。按劳取酬的进一步的改善，生产中的社会主义纪律和秩序的加强，直接从事物质生产的工作者的比重的提高，是劳动生产率增长的巨大潜力。
    在社会主义制度下，发挥社会主义竞赛中表现出来的工作者在改进技术和生产组织方面的创造主动性，是劳动生产率增长的动力。研究和推广生产革新者所积累的先进经验，对于社会劳动生产率的增长具有极大的意义。
    社会主义经济制度造成劳动生产率不断增长的必要性和可能性。
    苏联工业劳动生产率在第一个五年计划期间提高了百分之四十一，在第二个五年计划期间提高了百分之八十二。在第一个五年计划中，劳动生产率平均每年提高百分之九，在第二个五年计划中平均每年提高百分之十二点七。劳动生产率的这种增长速度在资本主义工业中是没有的。与一九一三年水平比较，一九四○年苏联工业劳动生产率提高了三倍，加上工作日的缩短，则提高了四点二倍。在战后时期，进一步从技术上重新装备国民经济，工人和工程技术干部的熟练程度的提高，以及他们的创造主动性的发扬，这一切使劳动生产率有了新的增长。与一九四○年比较，一九五三年劳动生产率在工业中提高了百分之七十一，在建筑业中提高了百分之五十。
    最近二十五年（一九二八年—一九五三年）工业劳动生产率大约提高五倍，在建筑业和铁路运输业中大约提高二点五倍。在集体农庄和国营农场中，劳动生产率比革命前的农业劳动生产率大约超过二倍。
    但是从解决最大限度地满足人民日益增长的需要的任务来看，从解决在经济竞赛方面胜过先进资本主义国家的任务来看，苏联劳动生产率的现有水平还是不够的。共产党正动员劳动者为大力提高劳动生产率而斗争。
    保证有丰富的消费品的劳动生产率的不断增长，是从社会主义过渡到共产主义的必要前提。
    简短的结论
    （一）社会主义使劳动者摆脱了剥削，用为自己、为全社会的自由劳动代替了为剥削者的强迫劳动。在社会主义制度下，劳动具有创造性，并且是在全社会的范围内有计划地组织起来的。但是在社会主义制度下，劳动尚未成为人们的生活的第一需要，它是需要物质刺激的。社会主义社会对于每个工作者的劳动量和报酬量实行极严格的监督。
    （二）在苏联，劳动是每个有劳动能力的社会成员的义务和光荣的事情。在社会主义国民经济体系中，消灭了失业，实现了社会一切成员的劳动权利。在社会主义制度下，生产的不断增长造成就业人数的不断增加和他们文化技术水平的提高。
    （三）每个工作者从物质利益上关心自己劳动的结果的原则是社会主义经营的根本原则之一。在社会主义制度下起作用的是按劳分配的经济法则，这一法则要求直接按劳动的数量和质量来分配物质资料。
    （四）社会主义劳动协作是不受剥削的、以同志合作的关系联系起来的工作者的协作。它建立在高度技术的基础上，它的特征是自觉的纪律，是把一长制同广泛发挥群众的积极性和自动性结合起来的新型的管理。社会主义协作的最重要的特征是社会主义竞赛。社会主义竞赛是社会主义经济发展的动力。
    （五）社会主义创造了高于资本主义的社会劳动生产率。劳动生产率的增长是不断提高社会主义生产和人民福利的决定的条件。劳动生产率的不断增长是社会主义社会发展的经济法则。
