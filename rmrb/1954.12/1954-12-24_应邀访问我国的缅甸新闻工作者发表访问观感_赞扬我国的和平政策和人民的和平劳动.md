Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Burmese journalists U Hla Kyi, U Pe Than, and U Soe Maung, who were invited by the All-China Journalists Association to visit China, delivered radio speeches (recordings) on the Central People's Broadcasting Station on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd, respectively, describing their impressions of China.

U Hla Kyi said that the Chinese people have very remarkable spirits such as loving peace, working tirelessly, and abiding by discipline. He said: "Due to the workers' enthusiasm for labor and the determination of the Chinese people, I dare to predict that the People's Republic of China will become an example that will amaze the world in the near future." Referring to the joint statement between China and Burma on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, U Hla Kyi expressed the hope that cultural exchanges and trade between China and Burma would be further developed. He said that this would help consolidate the friendship between China and Burma and safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

U Pe Than said: "In New China, everyone has the right to participate in the work of building the motherland, and everyone can enjoy the fruits of their labor, ability, and creation. The people of New China demand peace. I believe that a country striving for lasting peace will never waste time considering cannons, munitions, and armed conflict. However, I firmly believe that if foreign forces attempt to infringe upon the rights of the Chinese people, open fire on New China, or invade Chinese territory, New China will have unparalleled courage, manpower, and other potential to repel any aggression."

U Soe Maung said that during their stay in Beijing, they were very pleased to see that an important cornerstone had been laid for Sino-Burmese friendly relations. He also said: "We have seen that reforms and construction work are being actively carried out in various parts of New China with the assistance and cooperation of the masses. As an Oriental, I feel very honored to see China progressing by leaps and bounds."

    应邀访问我国的缅甸新闻工作者发表访问观感
    赞扬我国的和平政策和人民的和平劳动
    【新华社二十三日讯】应中国新闻工作者联谊会邀请来我国访问的缅甸新闻工作者吴拉吉、吴佩阵和吴梭貌于二十日、二十一日和二十二日分别在中央人民广播电台发表广播讲话（录音），叙述对中国的观感。
    吴拉吉说，中国人民有着热爱和平、对工作不辞劳苦、遵守纪律等非常显著的精神。他说：由于工人们的劳动热情和中国人民的决心，我敢于预言，中华人民共和国将在不久的将来成为一个足以使世人惊服的范例。吴拉吉在谈到中缅两国关于和平共处五项原则的联合声明后表示希望中缅两国间的文化交流和贸易获得进一步的发展。他说，这将有助于巩固中缅两国的友谊和维护亚洲和世界和平。
    吴佩阵说：在新中国，每一个人都有权参加建设祖国的工作，每一个人都可以享受他们劳动、能力和创造的成果。新中国的人民要求和平。我认为这样一个努力争取持久和平的国家，决不会在考虑大炮、军火以及武装冲突这类事情上浪费时间。可是，我十分相信，假如外国势力想侵犯中国人民的权利，向新中国开火，或者侵入中国领土，新中国就有无比的勇气、人力和其他潜力去击退任何侵略。
    吴梭貌说，我们在北京期间非常高兴地看见了中缅友好关系已经奠下了重要的基石。他还说：我们看到了新中国各地正在群众的协助和合作下积极进行着改革和建设工作。作为一个东方人，看到中国在突飞猛进地进展着，我感到非常光荣。
