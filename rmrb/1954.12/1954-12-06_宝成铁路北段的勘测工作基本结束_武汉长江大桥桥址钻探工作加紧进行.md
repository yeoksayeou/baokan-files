    Surveying Work on Northern Section of Baoji-Chengdu Railway Basically Completed
    Drilling at Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Site Intensified
    The surveying work on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been basically completed. Up to now, the Second Survey and Design Team of the Northwest Design Branch of the Ministry of Railways, which is responsible for the surveying and design of this section, has handed over approximately one-third of the surveying and design data, covering roadbeds and key projects such as tunnels, bridges, and culverts in six work areas, to the construction units. The remaining data will be submitted in the first quarter of 1955 to ensure a smooth and comprehensive large-scale construction.
    The route from Baoji to Lueyang passes through the Qinling Mountains and the upper reaches of the Jialing River, with many complex terrain and geological conditions. Therefore, the definitive survey work on the railway mainline is extensive. The survey of this section has taken more than two years and involved more than forty shallow drilling teams and a physical electrical survey team. Among the more than 2,000 personnel involved in the survey, in addition to the Second Survey and Design Team as the main force, the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Geology sent personnel to support. Other survey and design units of the Ministry of Railways in the Northwest, Southwest, and North China also sent engineering and technical personnel to assist. (Xinhua News Agency)
    It is now the dry season on the Yangtze River. Three sets of drilling pontoons are moored in the middle of the river between Snake Mountain in Wuchang and Turtle Mountain in Hanyang every day, intensifying underwater drilling to collect data for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge site. Sixty-four boreholes have been drilled so far.
    Recently, to facilitate work in high winds and severe cold, the drillers have built windproof and cold-proof drilling towers around the drilling rigs on the boats using wooden boards and canvas. The boats are also equipped with food and cotton-padded clothing needed when they cannot go ashore due to strong winds and waves. On November 25, the river experienced a level 5 gale, with surging waves and heavy rain at night, but the drillers remained on duty day and night. The three drilling boat teams are continuing to launch a production increase and economy drive. The drillers are conscientiously studying the "dry drilling method" and "rapid drilling method" proposed by Soviet experts. In the past, the speed of the drilling rig was only 70 revolutions, but now it has generally increased to 110 to 120 revolutions, and the fastest has reached 210 revolutions. The core sampling rate is generally 75 to 80 percent, with the highest reaching 97 percent, all exceeding the original requirements. The drilling time for each pier has also been reduced from 21 to 25 days to 11 to 14 days.
    The drilling personnel have been working on the Yangtze River for half a year. During this period, these employees, mostly from mountains and fields, have become accustomed to offshore drilling, no longer suffering from dizziness and vomiting at the first sign of wind and waves. They have overcome attacks from level 6 and level 7 gales on the river several times. During this year's extraordinary floods on the Yangtze River, they also overcame the difficulties of deep water and rapid currents, and fought many battles against floating objects such as weeds and poisonous snakes.

### 宝成铁路北段的勘测工作基本结束  武汉长江大桥桥址钻探工作加紧进行

    宝成铁路北段的勘测工作基本结束
    武汉长江大桥桥址钻探工作加紧进行
    宝成铁路北段的勘测工作已经基本做完了。到目前为止，担负这段线路勘测设计工作的铁道部西北设计分局第二勘测设计总队，已经把约占全部里程三分之一的勘测设计资料交给了施工单位，其中包括六个工区里的路基和一些隧道、桥梁、涵洞等重点工程的资料。其余资料将在一九五五年第一季度里交齐，以便能够顺利地全面展开大规模施工。
    宝鸡到略阳这段路线要通过秦岭山岳地带和嘉陵江上流，其间有很多复杂的地形、地质情况。所以铁路正线的定测工作量很大，勘测这段路线已用了两年多时间，曾经出动过四十几个浅钻队和一个物理电测队。在全部参加勘测工作的二千多名人员里，除了第二勘测设计总队担任主力外，还有水利部、地质部派人来支援。铁道部在西北、西南、华北等地的其他勘测设计单位，也派出工程技术人员前来援助。　（新华社）
    长江已到冬季落水时期，在武昌蛇山和汉阳龟山之间有三组钻探趸船每天泊在江心，为搜集武汉长江大桥桥址资料而加紧进行水上钻探，到目前为止已钻好六十四个钻孔。
    不久以前，钻工们为了便于在大风和严寒中工作，已在船上的钻机周围，用木板和帆布做成了一个个挡风避寒的钻塔。船上并准备了起大风浪不能上岸时所需的粮食和棉衣。十一月二十五日，江上刮起五级大风，浪涛汹涌，入夜还下着大雨，可是钻工们仍昼夜坚守在船上。三组钻探船上正在继续展开增产节约劳动竞赛。钻工们认真地学习苏联专家提出的“干钻法”和“快速钻进法”。过去钻机的转速都只有七十转，现在已普遍提高到一百一十转到一百二十转，最快的到二百一十转。岩芯采取率一般在百分之七十五到八十，最高的达到百分之九十七，都超过原定要求。每一孔桥墩的钻探时间也由二十一天到二十五天减少到十一天到十四天。
    钻探人员们来到长江工作已经半年了。在过去这段时期，这些大都来自山野、陆上的职工们已经过惯了水上钻探生活，不再一遇风浪就晕眩呕吐；他们好几次战胜了江上六级和七级大风的袭击。在今年长江特大洪水的时候，他们还战胜了水深流急的困难，和杂草、毒蛇等漂流物作了许多斗争。
