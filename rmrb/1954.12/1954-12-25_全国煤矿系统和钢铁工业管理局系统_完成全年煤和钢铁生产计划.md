The national coal mine system has overfulfilled the annual production target by approximately 2% eighteen days ahead of schedule, and many units have also completed their increased production tasks. Currently, in addition to ensuring the completion of the original increased production plan, coal mine workers across the country are working hard to increase raw coal production by another 1.2 million tons.

With the further strengthening of planning management in mines across the country, more thorough and detailed arrangements have generally been made for the rational layout of roadways, clear mining methods, and the formulation of mining plans. For example, the mining plan of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau was formulated on the basis of first compiling mining operation regulations, and inspections were carried out during its implementation. This made the plan gradually more practical, so the bureau's Mines No. 1, 3, and 4 prepared nearly a year's worth of mineable coal for next year. The Fushun Mining Bureau implemented new quotas in November and carried out a comprehensive production reform, exceeding coal production by more than 50,000 tons. Mines across the country have also begun to attach importance to mine geological work. At present, most mines across the country have established mine geological institutions and equipped them with a certain number of cadres, who are actively organizing data and clarifying geological conditions. In recent months, through mine exploration, the Jixi Mining Bureau has comprehensively discovered 31 mineable coal seams in various mines, with preliminary estimates of total reserves of more than 50 million tons.

This year, mines across the country also actively reorganized labor organizations, and more than 24,000 employees were transferred by the end of October. Some of these employees directly supported capital construction, some were transferred to underground work faces, and others are being trained to prepare a certain amount of manpower for some newly built or rebuilt mines that are about to be transferred to production. Due to the reorganization of labor organizations and the improvement of mechanization in mines in North China, the overall efficiency was nearly 102%, and the underground efficiency in Datong reached more than 120%.

In order to establish a normal production order and ensure the comprehensive and balanced completion of production tasks, many units across the country, in conjunction with the establishment of a grassroots regional management system in mines, have planned, step-by-step, to learn and promote the experience of regular cyclical operations in the 1-meter layer of Ping'an Mine No. 1 in Fuxin. For example, the West 10th Road work face of Ping'an Mine No. 2 in Fuxin was able to complete one cycle per day and night by October, carrying out production rhythmically.

Although mines across the country have achieved the above-mentioned results, some problems still exist in the implementation of the production plan. First, the imbalance of geology, tunneling, and mining remains the weakest link in current coal mine production. Due to unclear geological conditions and unreasonable mining procedures, the improvement of the mining recovery rate has been seriously affected. Second, the completion of production tasks is not balanced enough and not comprehensive enough, and the phenomenon of being loose at the beginning and tight at the end has not changed significantly. Third, the idea of economic accounting has not been thoroughly implemented. Although production costs have generally been reduced, due to poor management, the consumption of major materials such as pit wood and gunpowder is still heavily overspent.

Xinhua News Agency reports: The output of major products of the Iron and Steel Industry Administration System of the Ministry of Heavy Industry this year, except for metallurgical coke, has exceeded the annual state plan by December 20. Among them, iron ore exceeded by 5.42%, pig iron exceeded by 9.1%, steel exceeded by 0.74%, and steel材 exceeded by 7.3%. Metallurgical coke has also completed 98.55% of the annual plan. The completion of the total output value plan of the entire administration had exceeded 1.16% by the end of November.

This year, the production level of the Iron and Steel Industry Administration System has improved a lot. Pig iron production is expected to increase by 29.5% compared with last year, and the quality of pig iron has also improved. Open-hearth steel production is expected to increase by 17.5% compared with last year (excluding the newly built open-hearth furnace of Chongqing 101 Steel Plant); electric furnace steel production will increase by 24.5% compared with last year; in terms of converter steel, due to the addition of some new equipment, production will increase by 89% compared with last year.

The balance of production this year has also been significantly improved. Taking iron smelting as an example, the completion of the annual plan of the entire administration system in the first three quarters this year was 27.09%, 25.72%, and 27.4% respectively.

Although the production tasks this year are heavier than last year, and new equipment has been put into production, the number of employees has not increased. It is estimated that the labor productivity of employees this year will exceed the plan by more than 11%, which will be 25.9% higher than last year.

Due to the improvement of financial cost management, the cost reduction this year is expected to complete 118.99% of the plan; the profit will complete 113.16% of the plan, which will be 22.2% higher than last year.

This year, the entire administration system has successively studied and promoted 26 important Soviet advanced experiences, which have played a great role in improving the production level. This year, the employees of various factories and mines have widely launched a technical innovation movement. According to statistics for the first half of the year, employees put forward a total of more than 11,700 rationalization proposals, adopted more than 4,600, and created wealth worth more than 30 billion yuan for the country.

### 全国煤矿系统和钢铁工业管理局系统  完成全年煤和钢铁生产计划

    全国煤矿系统和钢铁工业管理局系统
    完成全年煤和钢铁生产计划
    【本报讯】全国煤矿已提前十八天超额百分之二左右完成了全年生产任务，不少单位并已完成增产任务。目前全国煤矿职工除保证完成原订增产计划外，正为再多增产原煤一百二十万吨而努力。
    全国各矿随着计划管理的进一步加强，对于合理布置巷道，明确采煤方法，制订采掘计划，一般都已比较周密细致。如峰峰矿务局的采掘计划就是在先编制了采掘作业规程的基础上制定的，在执行中并进行了检查，这就使计划逐渐切合实际，所以这个局今年一、三、四矿为明年准备了将近一年的可采煤量。抚顺矿务局在十一月份贯彻了新定额，进行了全面的生产改革，超额产煤五万多吨。全国各矿对于矿井地质工作也开始重视。目前全国各矿大部分建立了矿井地质机构，配备了一定的干部，正积极进行整理资料、搞清地质情况等工作。鸡西矿务局近几个月通过矿井探勘，各矿综合发现了可采煤层三十一个，初步估计埋藏量共达五千多万吨。
    全国各矿今年还积极整顿了劳动组织，到十月底已抽调出职工二万四千多人。这些职工一部分直接支援了基本建设，一部分调往井下充实到工作面上，另一部分正进行培训，为某些即将移交生产的新建或改建矿井准备了一定的力量。华北各矿由于整顿了劳动组织和机械化程度的提高，全员效率完成将近百分之一○二，大同井下效率达百分之一二○以上。
    为了建立正常的生产秩序，保证全面地、均衡地完成生产任务，全国不少单位结合建立矿井基层区域管理制，有计划、有步骤地学习和推广了阜新平安一坑一公尺层正规循环作业的经验。如阜新平安二坑西十路工作面至十月份已能够做到一昼夜一个循环，有节奏地进行生产。
    全国各矿虽已取得上述的成绩，但在生产计划执行中，也还存在一些问题。首先是地质、掘进、回采的不平衡，依然是目前煤矿生产中最薄弱的环节。由于地质情况不清和开采程序不合理，回采率的提高受到了严重影响。其次是生产任务完成得不够均衡和不够全面，前松后紧的现象还没有很大的改变。第三是经济核算思想没有贯彻到底，生产成本虽然普遍降低，但由于管理不善，坑木、火药等主要材料消耗还大量超支。
    据新华社讯：重工业部钢铁工业管理局系统今年主要产品的产量，除冶金焦外，到十二月二十日止都已超过了全年国家计划。其中铁矿石超过百分之五点四二，生铁超过百分之九点一，钢超过百分之零点七四，钢材超过百分之七点三。冶金焦也已完成全年计划的百分之九十八点五五。全管理局的总产值计划的完成情况，到十一月底就已超过百分之一点一六。
    今年钢铁工业管理局系统的生产水平提高了很多。生铁产量预计将比去年提高百分之二十九点五，生铁的质量也有提高。平炉钢产量预计将比去年提高百分之十七点五（重庆一零一钢铁厂新建平炉未计算在内）；电炉钢产量将比去年提高百分之二十四点五；转炉钢方面因增加了些新的设备，产量将比去年提高百分之八十九。
    今年生产的均衡性也有显著改进。以炼铁为例：今年前三个季度全管理局系统分别完成年度计划的情况是，百分之二十七点零九、百分之二十五点七二、百分之二十七点四。
    今年生产任务虽然比去年重，而且有新设备投入生产，但是职工人数并没有增加。今年职工的劳动生产率，预计将超过计划百分之十一以上，将比去年提高百分之二十五点九。
    由于财务成本管理的改进，今年成本降低额预计将完成计划百分之一百十八点九九；利润将完成计划百分之一百十三点一六，将比去年提高百分之二十二点二。
    全管理局系统今年先后学习和推广了二十六项重要的苏联先进经验，对提高生产水平起了很大作用。各厂矿职工今年广泛展开了技术革新运动。据上半年统计，职工们共提出合理化建议一万一千七百多件，采纳四千六百多件，给国家创造价值三百多亿元的财富。
