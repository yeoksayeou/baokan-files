The so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a war treaty by which the US aggressive bloc forcibly occupies Chinese territory and prepares to launch large-scale provocative attacks against the Chinese people. This treaty poses an extremely serious threat to peace in the Far East and the world. It endangers the vital interests of the people of the world and is bound to be opposed by the broad masses of the people. Precisely because of this, the US aggressive bloc and its followers are trying their best to conceal the essence of this war treaty with all kinds of deceptive arguments. Even some US senators, who usually enjoy clamoring for war, are desperately trying to whitewash this war treaty as having a peaceful effect.

However, the war nature of the US-Chiang treaty cannot be concealed after all.

Now, let us look at this issue from the following aspects: First, is the US-Chiang treaty of an aggressive war nature or a defensive nature?

Dulles said at a press conference on December 1 that the US-Chiang treaty "is defensive in nature." The British Foreign Office spokesman immediately echoed on the same day, saying that the treaty was "purely defensive."

Where is the "defensive nature" of the US-Chiang "treaty"?

Taiwan and Penghu are both Chinese territories, as stipulated by the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," both of which the United States and Britain participated in. The United States has come to a place more than 10,000 kilometers away from its territory, and on the strength of a treaty signed with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, it is determined to seize China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu, as well as other possible territories. This fact itself is not of a "defensive nature," but a naked step in a war of aggression. If someone in Long Island, USA, fostered a regime that opposed its own government in the form of a military alliance, and clamored that if the United States wanted to recover the island, it would take action, who would think that this military alliance was of a defensive nature? Hitler forcibly occupied Austria, saying it was for "living space"; Japanese militarists forcibly occupied Northeast China, saying it was for "self-defense." The fact that the US government is embarking on this path of aggressive war is obvious to everyone. This cannot be defended, nor is it allowed to be defended.

Second, the US-Chiang treaty will also expand the war

British officials expressed "hope" that the treaty would have a "restraining influence" on the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The next day, US officials said it had a "persuasive restraining effect." It can be seen at a glance that this so-called "restraint" is completely deceiving the world. Its very existence is an admission that the United States is forcibly occupying Taiwan, and an attempt to conceal the essence of the US-Chiang treaty to expand the war. This Anglo-American double act is interesting, because they do not know how clumsy they are. In fact, the primary purpose of the US-Chiang treaty is to strengthen US support for the war activities of the Chiang bandit traitorous clique. The United States now plans to establish a so-called Sino-US Military Planning Commission in Taipei, as the highest US military planning, liaison and intelligence agency in the Western Pacific. Senior representatives of the US Seventh Fleet and Air Force will also participate. The US Air Force will send troops to Taiwan, and its task force is also studying the use of Taiwan's bases. In addition, the United States will also give the Chiang bandits two escort destroyers. May I ask, what is the purpose of all this if not to strengthen the harassing and destructive war carried out by the Chiang bandits?

Secondly, the US-Chiang treaty is to expand the war of aggression against China. Article 6 of the US-Chiang treaty stipulates that this treaty "shall also apply to such other territories as may be determined by mutual agreement." Shen Changhuan, the so-called vice minister of foreign affairs of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, said on the 3rd of this month that "the other territories referred to in Article 6 of this treaty... for our side, are all the Chinese territories other than Taiwan and Penghu listed." He also said, "According to the provisions of this article, the two sides can at any time consult and agree to expand the treaty area to any area of our country's territory." Shen Changhuan said again on the 3rd that this treaty "does not have any provisions restricting my counterattack against the mainland." Of course, Britain can argue that this is what the Chiang bandit traitorous clique said and does not count. Britain is advocating that the United States should consult with the Chiang bandits to play a "restraining role." However, people know that closely following these howls of the Shen bandit, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 3rd, Washington officials on the same day "expressed agreement... with Shen Changhuan's explanation: the new 'Mutual Defense Treaty' signed with the United States does not prevent the Taiwan government from launching attacks on the Communist mainland." The "New York Times" also bluntly stated on the 3rd: "Indeed, the 'flexible terms' in this treaty indicate this possibility: that some areas that are not free now will later be placed under the rule of free China." Precisely because the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is eager to expand the war and use the flesh and blood of the people of the world to preserve their own traitorous status, and precisely because the US aggressors and they are of the same mind and yearn to dominate the world, so as to turn the 20th century into an American century, the US-Chiang consultation that Britain hopes for is nothing more than a step to promote and expand the war. If you don't believe it, please look at the statement issued by Yu Hongjun, the so-called prime minister of the Chiang bandits' "Executive Yuan." Here, Yu the bandit dared to say that "We are determined to liberate our compatriots on the mainland to restore their freedom, and this sacred task can be achieved more quickly and successfully because of the conclusion of this treaty." This is the tacit understanding of the US-Chiang consultation. This is the true substance of the US-Chiang treaty that the Chiang bandit clique must shout out to embolden themselves. This is also what Article 6 of the US-Chiang treaty affirms.

The US's arrogant attempt to expand aggression is not limited to this. Dulles has openly stated that the US-Chiang treaty is another link in the collective security system (which should be read as a collective aggressive war system) that the United States is engaged in in the Pacific region. He wants to link this treaty with the planned Northeast Asia alliance, as well as the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and other aggressive treaties, and also link it with the North Atlantic Treaty system, preparing to expand the war to all of Asia and the world. In fact, the US aggressors are stepping up the deployment to expand the war of aggression. On the same day that the US-Chiang treaty was signed, the US Department of Defense announced that the Seventh Fleet in the Taiwan Strait would be placed under the command of the Pacific Fleet Commander. US Chief of Naval Operations Carney also openly said that the US naval forces in the Pacific were "in a state of readiness" and "can accept any task assigned to them." All of this proves undeniably that the purpose of the US-Chiang treaty is to launch a war of aggression against the People's Republic of China and to expand this war. Therefore, even Reuters reporter Rankin believes that Dulles' arrogant statement "actually amounts to clamoring to fight the Chinese Communists on the Asian continent." In fact, the US aggressors are more than just fighting against China. US monopoly capital, in pursuit of huge profits, is trying to launch a world war. This cannot be concealed by the United States or its followers. Third, who is aggravating the tension?

The above-mentioned absurd talk about the "restraining effect" of the treaty is purposeful. This is to shift the responsibility for the tense situation in the Far East onto China. For several days, the British side has deliberately avoided talking about the fact that the US-Chiang treaty endangers the situation in the Far East, but it has been spreading the atmosphere every day, urging our country not to take so-called "rash actions" and hoping that our country "will not take actions that are likely to aggravate the tense situation in this region." US and British public opinion also attempted to imply that because the "treaty" did not explicitly include the coastal islands under US "protection," it eased the tense situation on the Chinese coast. Here, if people are not foolish, these statements by the United States and Britain are in vain. Is it China that has forcibly occupied US territory, violated US airspace, and strafed and bombed the US people, or has the United States done this to China? Who is it that has concluded a so-called "treaty" with China's traitors, using them to wage war against China and expand the war? Even with regard to the coastal islands, Shen Changhuan of the Chiang bandit clique said on the 3rd that the US-Chiang treaty "has ample room for flexible activities for the joint defense of the outer islands (i.e., the coastal islands) by both sides." Dulles himself also said, "According to this treaty, this can include islands near the coast as well as other territories." It can be seen from this that the so-called US-Chiang treaty can ease the tense situation is completely shameless deception.

In fact, the tense situation in the Far East and on the Chinese coast is caused by the United States. One of the root causes is the US policy of hostility towards the People's Republic of China, forcibly occupying our territory, and threatening the Chinese people with war. For several years, the United States has launched a war of aggression against Korea in Korea, occupied our territory of Taiwan, supported the colonial war in Indochina, and surrounded our country from these three battlefronts. It has also established various military blocs in Asia and the Pacific region, forcibly occupied countless bases, and tried to arm Japan, making the situation in the entire Asian-Pacific region increasingly tense. Thanks to the efforts of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, China, and some other countries, the armistice in Korea and Indochina was achieved despite US obstruction, and the situation was originally somewhat eased. However, the United States is not reconciled to this, and continues to instigate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out war activities against our country. Now it has signed the US-Chiang treaty, further affirming the US's aggressive policy, and "legalizing" the US's forcible occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and its threat to China. This obviously makes the situation on the coastal islands, as well as the entire Taiwan Strait situation, even more explosive, and makes the tense situation in the Far East even more acute. Can this be eliminated by urging China not to take "rash actions"? Did Chamberlain's non-"rash" actions (which were actually a policy of surrender) towards Hitler eliminate the outbreak of World War II? Did it spare the British people from heavy disasters?

The entire history of the outbreak of World War II proves that its key lay in Munich. Those who surrendered abjectly to the fascist aggressors in Munich attempted to please the aggressors with non-"rash" actions, sacrificing the sovereignty, territory, and the interests of the people of other countries. However, history ruthlessly lashed them. They harmed their own people and almost failed to protect the sovereignty and territory of their own country. This is the bloody lesson of Munich. The Chinese people, from their long experience of struggle, deeply know that surrendering to aggressive forces is a great disaster for the people. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is to defend our country's sovereignty and territory, and to defend our people. It is a just, glorious and sacred task, and it is the solemn responsibility that our people bear for world peace. Sovereignty and territory are inviolable, and the interests of the people must be defended. This is the principle upon which all countries are founded. Only when this principle can be established can world peace be guaranteed. Those who regard the implementation and defense of this principle as "rash actions" should remember that history is never forgiving.

### 美蒋条约的战争性质是不能掩饰的

    美蒋条约的战争性质是不能掩饰的
    观察者
    美国政府和蒋介石卖国集团签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，是美国侵略集团强占中国领土，并且准备对中国人民发动大规模的挑衅进攻的战争条约。这个条约对于远东和世界和平的威胁极其严重，它危害着世界人民的切身利益，必然遭受广大人民的反对。正因为如此，美国侵略集团和它的追随者们就竭力企图用各种各样的欺骗论调来掩饰这个战争条约的实质。甚至连平日以叫嚣战争为乐事的有些美国参议员也极力企图把这个战争条约粉饰为有和平作用。
    但是，美蒋条约的战争性质毕竟是掩饰不住的。
    现在，让我们从如下几个方面来看这个问题：第一，美蒋条约是侵略战争
      性质还是防御性质？
    杜勒斯在十二月一日的记者招待会上说，美蒋条约“是防御性质的”。英国外交部发言人在同一天立刻跟着帮腔说，这个条约是“纯防御性的”。
    美蒋“条约”的“防御性质”在哪里呢？
    台湾和澎湖都是中国的领土，这是美国和英国都参加的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”所规定了的。美国跑到离它的领土一万多公里以外的地方来，凭着同蒋介石卖国集团签订的一纸条约，硬打算将中国的领土台湾和澎湖以及可能的其他领土霸占住。这个事实本身就不是什么“防御性质”的，而是赤裸裸的侵略战争的步骤。如果有人在美国的长岛用缔结军事同盟的形式扶植了一个反对它本国政府的政权，并且扬言说，如果美国要收复这个岛屿，他就要采取行动，在这种情况下，谁认为这个军事同盟是防御性质的呢？希特勒强占奥地利，说是为了“生存空间”；日本军国主义者强占我国东北，说是为了“自卫”。美国政府正在走这条侵略战争的道路的事实，昭昭在人耳目。这是不能辩解的，也不容置辩。
  第二，美蒋条约还要扩大战争
    英国官员表示“希望”这个条约对蒋介石卖国集团有“抑制影响”。转天，美国官员就表示它“具有说服力的抑制作用”。一眼就可以看清，这种所谓“抑制”完全是欺骗世界的。它的本身就是承认美国强占台湾，并想掩饰美蒋条约扩大战争的实质。英美两国的这种双簧是有趣的，因为他们不知自己是怎样笨拙。事实上，美蒋条约首先就是要加强美国支持蒋贼卖国集团的战争活动。美国现在就计划在台北成立一个所谓中美军事计划委员会，作为美国在西太平洋的最高军事计划、联络和情报机构，美国第七舰队和空军的高级代表还要参加。美国空军将派遣部队去台湾，它的特遣舰队也在研究使用台湾基地。除此之外，美国还要给蒋贼两只护航驱逐舰。试问这一切不是为了加强蒋贼所进行的骚扰性、破坏性战争是为了什么？
    其次，美蒋条约就是要扩大对中国的侵略战争。美蒋条约的第六条规定：这个条约“并将适用于经共同协议所决定之其他领土”。蒋介石卖国集团的所谓外交部次长沈昌焕在本月三日就说，“本约第六条所称其他领土……在我方为除列举之台湾、澎湖以外之全部中国领土”。他还说，“依该条规定，双方可随时会商协议决定将缔约区域扩展至我国领土之任何区域。”沈昌焕在三日又说，这个条约“并无任何限制我反攻大陆之规定”。当然，英国可以辩解说，这是蒋贼卖国集团讲的话，不能算数。英国是主张美国要和蒋贼会商来起什么“抑制作用”的。可是，人们知道，紧跟着沈贼的这些叫嚣，据路透社三日电，华盛顿官员在同一天就“表示同意……沈昌焕的解释：同美国签订的新的‘共同防御条约’并不阻止台湾政府向共产党大陆发动攻击。”“纽约时报”在三日也露骨地说：“的确，这个条约中的‘有伸缩性的条款’表明这种可能性：将有一些现在的非自由地区以后会置于自由中国统治之下。”正是因为蒋介石卖国集团急于扩大战争，用全世界人民的血肉来保存他们自己的卖国贼地位，正是因为美国侵略者和他们是同德同心，渴想独霸全世界，以便把二十世纪变成美国世纪，所以英国所指望的美蒋会商，不过是促进战争、扩大战争的步骤而已。不信的话，就请看蒋贼的所谓行政院长俞鸿钧发表的声明。俞贼在这里竟敢于说什么“吾人决心解救大陆同胞以恢复其自由，此项神圣工作因此约之缔结，必可更迅速获得最后成功。”这就是美蒋会商的默契。这就是蒋贼集团为了壮胆，必须嚷出来的美蒋条约中的真东西。这也就是美蒋条约第六条所肯定了的东西。
    美国扩大侵略的狂妄企图还不只此。杜勒斯就公开表示过，美蒋条约是美国在太平洋地区所搞的集体安全体系（应该读为集体侵略的战争体系）中的另一环节。他就是要把这个条约同策划中的东北亚联盟，以及东南亚侵略集团和其他侵略条约等联在一起，并且和北大西洋公约体系也联在一起，准备向全亚洲和全世界扩大战争。事实上，美国侵略者正在加紧扩大侵略战争的部署。就在美蒋条约签订的同一天，美国国防部就宣布将在台湾海峡的第七舰队划归太平洋舰队司令指挥。美国海军作战部长卡涅也公然说美国在太平洋的海军部队已“处于准备停当状态”，“可以接受分配给他们的任何任务”。所有这一切都无可置辩地证明：美蒋条约的目的就是对中华人民共和国进行侵略战争并扩大这个战争。因此，甚至路透社的记者兰金也认为杜勒斯的狂妄声明“实际上等于扬言要在亚洲大陆上和中国共产党作战”。其实，美国侵略者岂止是要对中国作战而已。美国垄断资本为了追求庞大利润，正在力图搞起世界战争。这不是美国或美国的追随者所能掩盖的。第三，究竟是谁在加剧紧张局势？
    上面那些什么条约的“抑制作用”等等妄谈是有目的的。这就是要把远东紧张局势的责任推在中国身上。几天以来，英国方面有意不谈美蒋条约危害远东局势的事实，却偏要天天散布空气，要我国不采取所谓“轻率的行动”，希望我国“不要采取大概会使这个地区的紧张局势加剧的行动”。美英舆论还企图暗示因“条约”没有将沿海岛屿明文列入美国“保护”之下，因此它就缓和了中国沿海的紧张局势。在这里，如果人们不是痴愚，美英的这些说法就是徒劳。究竟是中国强占了美国的领土，侵犯了美国的领空，扫射和轰炸了美国的人民，还是美国对中国这样做了呢？同中国的卖国贼订立所谓“条约”，利用他们对中国进行战争，扩大战争的究竟是谁？甚至就沿海岛屿来讲，蒋贼集团的沈昌焕在三日也说，美蒋条约“对于双方协防外岛（即沿海岛屿）一事富有充分伸缩活动之余地”。杜勒斯自己也说，“根据这个条约，这可以包括海岸附近的岛屿以及其他领土。”由此可见，所谓美蒋条约能缓和紧张局势的说法完全是无耻的欺骗。
    事实上，远东和中国沿海的紧张局势是美国所造成的。其根源之一就是美国敌视中华人民共和国，强占我国领土，对中国人民进行战争威胁的政策。几年以来，美国在朝鲜发动侵朝战争，侵占我国领土台湾，支持印度支那殖民战争，从这三个战线上包围我国。它并在亚洲和太平洋地区建立各种军事集团，强占无数基地，力图武装日本，使整个亚洲太平洋区域的局势越来越紧张。由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、苏联和中国以及某些其他国家的努力，克服了美国的阻挠，使朝鲜和印度支那停战之后，局势本来有了些缓和。但美国却死不甘心，继续极力指使蒋介石卖国集团对我国进行战争活动，现在它又签订美蒋条约，进一步肯定了美国的侵略政策，使美国对中国领土台湾的强占和对中国的威胁“合法化”，这显然使沿海岛屿的局势和整个台湾海峡的局势一样，更其具有了爆炸的性质，使远东紧张局势更为加剧。这难道是什么要中国不采取“轻率行动”所能消除的吗？难道过去张伯伦对希特勒的不“轻率”的行动（其实就是投降政策）消除了第二次世界大战的爆发么？难道它使英国人民免掉了沉重的灾难么？
    整个第二次世界大战爆发的历史证明了它的关键就在于慕尼黑。那些在慕尼黑卑屈地向法西斯侵略者投降的人们，企图用什么不“轻率”的行动，牺牲他国的主权、领土和人民的利益来讨侵略者的欢心。可是历史却毫不容情地鞭打了他们。他们害了他们自己的人民，并几乎使自己国家的主权和领土不保。这就是慕尼黑的血的教训。中国人民从自己长期斗争的经验中，深知屈服于侵略势力就是人民的莫大灾难。中国人民解放台湾的斗争是为了保卫我国的主权和领土，保卫我国的人民。它是正义的、光荣神圣的任务，是我国人民对世界和平所负的庄严责任。主权和领土不容侵犯，人民的利益必须保卫，这是一切国家立国的原则。只有这个原则能够确立，世界和平才能有保障。那些把执行和保卫这种原则视为“轻率行动”的人们应该记住历史是绝不容情的。
