    Oppose Bourgeois Advertising Techniques
    Chao Qi
    The Third Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building recently issued a circular, pointing out several instances of exaggeration in product advertisements published by its affiliated units:
    I. Products are included in product samples before they have even been test-manufactured. Examples include the three-ton truck crane of the Dalian Crane Machine Factory and a type of Soviet-style cone crusher from the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, etc.
    II. Advertisements are published and customers solicited even though trial production has not been successful. Examples include the electromagnetic crane of the Dalian Crane Machine Factory, the 150-meter horizontal drill of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, and the mast crane of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, etc. Even more serious is the case of the Fushun Heavy Machinery Factory, which, despite the Bureau's instructions, published an advertisement in the Worker's Daily using a Soviet product photo for the half-cubic meter and one-cubic meter electric shovels that it had not yet completed trial production of.
    III. The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory advertised electric mud guns manufactured for Anshan Iron and Steel Company, even though these were custom orders with only a few users, making advertising completely unnecessary.
    Of course, introducing and promoting products is very necessary. This can help users accurately understand product performance, facilitate their selection, and expand product sales, which is beneficial to the country and the people. However, this introduction must be realistic and truthful, without exaggeration, without representing what does not exist as existing, and certainly without representing other people's products as one's own. If this is the case, it is not publicity but deception of users. In our country, most of the users of these products are state-owned enterprises. Deceiving them and causing them damage is also causing damage to the country. Therefore, this behavior must be stopped immediately, and these bourgeois advertising techniques must be opposed.

    反对资产阶级的广告术
    超琪
    第一机械工业部第三机器工业管理局最近发出一个通报，指出所属单位刊登产品广告中的若干虚夸现象：
    一、还没有试造就编入产品样本。例如大连起重机器厂的三吨汽车起重机，沈阳重型机器厂的一种苏联式圆锥破碎机等等。
    二、试制了还没有成功就刊登广告，招揽主顾。例如大连起重机器的电磁吊车，太原矿山机器厂的一五○公尺水平钻机，沈阳矿山机器厂的桅杆起重机等等。更为严重的是抚顺重型机器厂，试制半立方公尺和一立方公尺的电铲还没有完成，也不顾管理局的指示，竟用苏联的产品照片在工人日报上刊登广告。
    三、沈阳重型机器厂承制鞍山钢铁公司的电动泥炮，原是专案订货，用户只有几家，完全不需要登广告，但也登了。
    当然，介绍和宣传产品是很必要的。这可以帮助使用者确切了解产品的性能，便于他们的选择，也可以扩大产品的销路，对国家对人民都有好处。可是，这种介绍必须是实事求是的，不能夸大，不能把没有说成有，更不应该把别人的说成自己的。如果这样，就不是宣传而是对用户的欺骗。在我们国家里，使用以上产品的大多是国营企业，欺骗它们，使他们遭到损害，也就是使国家受到损害。因此必须立即停止这种行为，反对这种资产阶级的广告术。
