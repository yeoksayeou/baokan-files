Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 17th: The French National Assembly Defense Committee voted down a report in favor of ratifying the London and Paris Agreements by a vote of 21 to 11 on the evening of the 16th. In a meeting the previous day, the Defense Committee had heard speeches by French Prime Minister Mendès France and Defense and Armed Forces Minister Tang Bol, and before the vote, they heard a report from Committee Rapporteur Rustonou-Lagor, all of whom urged the committee to support the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements.

After the vote, the Defense Committee immediately re-elected the rapporteur who would present the committee's report on the Paris Agreements to the National Assembly. As a result of the election, Vincent Badie, a Radical Socialist Party member of parliament who opposes the ratification of the Paris Agreements, was elected.

    反对批准巴黎协定
    【新华社十七日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会国防委员会十六日晚间以二十一票对十一票否决了赞成批准伦敦和巴黎协定的报告。国防委员会在前一天的会议上曾听取了法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯和国防和武装部队部部长唐勃尔的演说，表决前又听取了委员会报告员鲁斯多诺—拉果的报告，他们都要求委员会赞成批准伦敦和巴黎协定。
    国防委员会在表决之后，立即改选了这个委员会向国民议会提出关于巴黎协定的报告的报告员。选举结果，反对批准巴黎协定的激进社会党议员樊尚·巴迪当选。
