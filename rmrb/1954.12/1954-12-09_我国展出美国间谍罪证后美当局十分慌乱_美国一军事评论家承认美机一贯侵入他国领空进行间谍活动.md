Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch: The Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China held an exhibition in Beijing displaying evidence of the U.S. dispatching aerial spies to sneak into our country's borders and engage in nefarious activities, causing the U.S. authorities, who are trying to deny this criminal behavior, to become flustered.

After this exhibition was held, the U.S. Air Force hurriedly denied that the U.S. Air Force had aerial retrieval devices like those exhibited, which were used to take U.S. agents on the ground onto the plane. According to a report by the United Press, U.S. Air Force officials said that using aerial retrieval devices to take people from the ground onto the plane was "utterly absurd." They pretended to have a scientific basis, saying that ordinary people could not withstand such vibrations. However, just a few days ago, the U.S. Air Force in the Far East boasted that the U.S. Air Force already had and had tested this aerial retrieval device. According to the same United Press report, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force in the Far East said on December 1 that the U.S. Air Force "had tested a basket attached with ropes," and "this equipment can pick up a person from land while the plane is flying."

Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch: New York News: The New York "Daily Worker" reported on the 5th that Hanson Baldwin, a military commentator for the "New York Times," admitted in a column that the United States had consistently used aircraft to sneak into other countries' borders for espionage activities for many years.

In a column entitled "The Price of Survival," published on September 14, he wrote: "For eight years, especially since the Korean War began in 1950, U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft have flown along the Soviet border, and have crossed these borders several times. They have been seeking intelligence of different natures, both positive and negative."

Baldwin then described the flights of U.S. aircraft performing tasks such as photographic reconnaissance, electronic intelligence, and radioactive intelligence.

Baldwin then frankly admitted: "In addition, several American aircraft probably deliberately penetrated the aerial borders of other countries. The mission of these aircraft may be called espionage, which is different from the routine and continuous reconnaissance flights over the high seas and the territory of friendly countries. Thus, it is possible to drop agents by parachute and conduct photography or electronic recording work over the territory of other countries."

    我国展出美国间谍罪证后美当局十分慌乱
    美国一军事评论家承认美机一贯侵入他国领空进行间谍活动
      【新华社八日讯】中华人民共和国公安部在北京举办展览会展出美国派遣空中间谍偷入我国国境从事罪恶活动的证物，使力图抵赖这种罪恶行为的美国当局慌乱失措起来了。
    在这个展览会展出以后，美国空军方面急忙否认美国空军有像在展览会展出的空取器，这种空取器是用来把地面上的美国特务带上飞机去的。据合众社报道，美国空军官员说用空取器从地面上把人带上飞机是“荒谬透顶的”。他们装得很有科学根据的样子，说什么常人受不了那样的震动。但是，就在几天以前，远东美国空军方面还夸耀过美国空军已经有而且已经试验过这种空取器了。据同一个合众社报道，远东美国空军的发言人在十二月一日说，美国空军“曾试验过一种附有绳子的篮子”，“这种设备当飞机飞行时，可以从陆地取上一个人”。
    【新华社八日讯】纽约消息：纽约“工人日报”五日报道，“纽约时报”军事评论家汉逊·鲍德温在一篇专栏文章里承认了美国多年来一贯利用飞机偷入别国国境进行间谍活动。
    在九月十四日发表的题为“幸存的代价”的一篇专栏文章里写道：“在八年来，尤其是从一九五○年朝鲜战争开始以来，美国空军和海军的飞机曾沿着苏联边界飞行过，而且有几次曾越过这些边界。他们一直在寻觅具有不同性质的、正面的和反面的情报。”
    鲍德温接着描述了那些执行摄影侦察、电子情报、放射性情报等任务的美国飞机的飞行。
    鲍德温然后直认：“另外有几架美国的飞机大概是故意穿入别国的空中边界的。这些飞机的任务也许可以称之为进行间谍活动，而与在公海和友好国家领土的上空所作的例行的和连续性的侦察飞行是不同的。这样就可能用降落伞投下特务人员并在别国领土的上空进行摄影或电子记录的工作。”
