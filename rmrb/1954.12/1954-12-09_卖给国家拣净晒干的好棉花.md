    The Renjian Agricultural Production Cooperative of Qianyang County, Hunan Province, harvested a total of 6,129 jin of seed cotton from the 29.6 mu of cotton planted this year. In order to sell more cotton to the state, the cooperative members voluntarily reduced the amount of lint cotton originally intended for their own use from 80 jin to 62 jin. Before selling the cotton, the cooperative members actively picked out impurities and inferior cotton. Female cooperative member Shu Zhixiu said: "We must pick the cotton clean so that the older brother workers can spin the yarn quickly and well, and so that the state does not suffer losses." The 1,640 jin of lint cotton they sold to the state a few days ago, because it was dried thoroughly and picked clean, had only 11 jin that was of the next lower grade, and the rest was all of superior quality.

    卖给国家拣净晒干的好棉花
    湖南省黔阳县仁建农业生产合作社今年种的二十九亩六分棉花，共收籽棉六千一百二十九斤。社员们为了把更多的棉花卖给国家，自动把原来准备留下自用的八十斤皮棉，减少为六十二斤。在出售棉花以前，社员们积极挑拣杂质和不好的棉花。女社员舒之秀说：“我们一定要把棉花拣干净，让工人老大哥纺起纱来又快又好，让国家不受损失。”他们前些日子卖给国家的一千六百四十斤皮棉，由于晒得干、拣得净，只有十一斤是次上级，其余的质量都是上级。　　　　（陈球明）
