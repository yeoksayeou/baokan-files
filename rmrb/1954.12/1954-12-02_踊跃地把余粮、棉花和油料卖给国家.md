    Exceeding the Grain Unified Purchase Task
    The Shaoyang Special District in Hunan Province, which has always been a grain-deficient area, has had a bumper harvest this year. The vast number of farmers are enthusiastically selling surplus grain to the state. By November 17th, the grain stored in the entire special district had reached 102.29% of the original planned purchase task. In addition to supplying the planned needs of the district, one-third of the unified purchased grain can be transferred to support the disaster areas around the lakes.
    After the bumper harvest, farmers in the Shaoyang Special District, under the slogan of "Support the state's socialist industrialization, support the liberation of Taiwan, and support the people in disaster areas," joyfully sold surplus grain. In many areas such as Jintang Township in the Tenth District of Wugang County, farmers beat gongs and drums, carrying red flags with slogans like "Patriotic Grain Sales" and "Following the Socialist Road to Prosperity," collectively sending the grain for sale to the state granaries. Many townships completed the grain unified purchase task in one or two days. Now, farmers everywhere are actively engaged in winter production. After completing the unified purchase task, Qinping Township in the First District of Shuangfeng County mobilized 169 people in one day, using 26 waterwheels and more than 1,200 buckets to irrigate crops such as rapeseed and wheat. During this period, agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations throughout the special district have also been further consolidated and developed. (Xu Xin)
    Sell More Surplus Grain After a Bumper Harvest
    Kangbao County, Hebei Province, has had its biggest harvest in 20 years. The county has just over 136,400 people, and this year's output of raw grain is approximately 210 million jin. In Hounao Township, the Seventh District, the best years in the past only produced 100 jin of naked oats per mu, but this year it produced more than 150 jin.
    Kangbao County suffered severe droughts in 1951 and 1953. With the support of people from all over the country, the county's farmers were able to overcome the disasters. Yin Zhenwu, the director of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative, said: Last year, our village didn't even have half a normal harvest, but no one was freezing or starving. This spring, when the cooperative was about to sow seeds, we didn't have any. The state promptly lent us 16 million yuan to buy back 22,000 jin of wheat, naked oats, and other seeds that were transported from other places. If it weren't for the support of the state and farmers across the country, let alone a bumper harvest this year, we wouldn't even have been able to plant the land! This agricultural production cooperative decided to collectively sell 350,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Many farm households across the county sold 2,000 to 3,000 jin of grain to the state at a time, and local purchasing stations were sometimes able to purchase more than 100,000 jin of grain a day. According to incomplete statistics as of November 4th, farmers across the county have already sold 13.67 million jin of surplus grain to the state. On November 3rd, the county people's congress meeting passed a resolution that the entire county would sell 104.23 million jin of surplus grain to the state.

    The Model Role of Agricultural Production Cooperatives
    This year, the 359 agricultural production cooperatives in Luan County, Shanxi Province, achieved a per-mu yield of 238 jin in the autumn fields, exceeding the county's average yield by 11.6 liang and exceeding the mutual aid group yield by 9.3 liang. These agricultural production cooperatives not only showed their superiority in production, but also demonstrated particular enthusiasm in selling surplus grain. They have now sold more than 6.31 million jin of surplus grain to the state. Among them, the Juzhai Agricultural Production Cooperative collectively sold more than 137,000 jin of grain, doubling the amount sold last year. The Hetou Agricultural Production Cooperative produced an average of 289 jin of millet per mu this year, an increase of 42 jin over last year. The income of cooperative members has generally increased, and they have sold 140,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Wei Renqun, a member of the Weijiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative, used to be a grain-deficient household, but after joining the agricultural production cooperative this year, he also became a surplus grain household. He has preliminarily decided to sell 500 jin of surplus grain. (Ren Qing et al.)
    The Surge in Cotton Sales
    The 330,000 mu of cotton planted in Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, is estimated to yield 20% to 30% more per mu than last year. Since September, farmers in various places have been enthusiastically selling cotton to the state. The Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fujiapu Village is expected to harvest more than 14,500 jin of ginned cotton this year, and has already sold more than 11,000 jin to the state. Around the end of October, the average daily market volume of cotton in Yongledian Town, the Second District, was more than 70,000 jin, exceeding the highest record of cotton market volume in the town's history. According to statistics from the county's 14 cotton collection stations as of November 5th, more than 8,895,000 jin of ginned cotton have been collected, exceeding the purchase target for September and October by 2.7% and exceeding the purchase volume in the same period last year by 14%.
    In order for textile factories to produce more and better fabrics, many farmers carefully sorted and dried the cotton before selling it. Of the 7,480 jin of ginned cotton sold by the Shiwang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative to the state, only 700 jin was of medium grade, and the rest was of superior grade. In previous years, the average impurity content of cotton purchased in Jingyang County was above 1.8%, and some even reached 3%. This year, the impurity content is generally around 1.5%.
    Abide by the Pre-Purchase Contracts and Actively Sell Oilseeds
    Farmers in the Jining, Jiaozhou, and other special districts of Shandong Province, which are rich in peanuts, are actively delivering peanuts to supply and marketing cooperatives in accordance with pre-purchase contracts. On October 25th, farmers in the Fourth District of Teng County delivered more than 110,000 jin of peanuts pre-purchased by the state to the supply and marketing cooperative in one day. In addition to fulfilling the contracts, farmers are also selling a large number of oilseeds to the state. By early November, Rizhao, Zhucheng, and other five counties in the Jiaozhou Special District had purchased more than 40 million jin of peanuts; Teng County, Qufu, and other five counties in the Jining Special District had purchased more than 1.27 million jin of peanut kernels and more than 300,000 jin of peanuts by November 3rd. The county people's congress meeting held in Wendeng County from November 15th to 20th also passed a resolution to organize farmers throughout the county to sell 30.7 million jin of peanut kernels.
      No Longer Wasting Peanuts
    Farmers in Hong'an County, an old revolutionary base area in Hubei Province, are actively selling peanuts to the state. According to statistics as of November 5th, the county's supply and marketing cooperatives have already purchased 3.3 million jin of peanuts.
    After liberation, the farmers of Hong'an County gradually healed the wounds inflicted by Chiang Kai-shek's cruel persecution and their lives are getting better and better. The county is originally rich in peanuts, with an annual output of about 10 million jin, but very little has been sold in the past two years. According to typical surveys, farmers have sold less than a quarter of the peanut production. Many of the peanuts left by the farmers are used to entertain guests or as breakfast dishes. This year, the farmers of Hong'an County, after being educated about the state's general task during the transition period and visiting the exhibition of pictures of industrial and agricultural construction and improvements in people's lives held by the county cultural center, have expressed their willingness to sell as many peanuts as possible to the state to support the state's industrial construction and support the liberation of Taiwan. Hu Xuewei, the director of the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinghua Township, left two bamboo baskets of peanuts last year and finished eating them in just one "first month" (Lunar New Year). This year, he only left 15 jin. After careful calculation, the entire cooperative used more than 900 jin less peanuts than last year.

    踊跃地把余粮、棉花和油料卖给国家
    超额完成粮食统购任务
    一向是缺粮地区的湖南省邵阳专区今年得到丰收。广大农民踊跃地把余粮卖给国家，到十一月十七日，全专区入库的粮食已经达到原计划收购任务的百分之一百零二点二九。这些统购的粮食除了供本区计划供应外，还可以调出三分之一支援滨湖灾区。
    邵阳专区农民丰收以后，在“支援国家社会主义工业化、支援解放台湾、支援灾区人民”的口号下，欢欣鼓舞出卖余粮。武冈县第十区金堂乡等许多地区的农民敲锣打鼓，打着“爱国售粮”、“走社会主义富裕道路”等红旗，集体把出售的余粮送入国家粮库。许多乡在一两天内就完成了粮食统购任务。现在各地农民正积极进行冬季生产。双峰县第一区琴平乡完成统购任务以后，一天就出动一百六十九人，使用二十六架水车、一千二百多个水桶，浇灌了油菜、麦子等农作物。全专区的农业生产互助合作组织，在这个期间也得到了进一步的巩固和发展。（叙新）
    丰收后多卖余粮
    河北省康保县今年获得了二十年来没有过的大丰收。全县仅十三万六千四百多口人，今年约产原粮二亿一千多万斤。第七区后淖乡前几年最好的年成每亩地只能产一百斤莜麦，今年产了一百五十多斤。
    康保县在一九五一年和一九五三年都遭受过严重的旱灾，在各地人民的支持下，全县农民才胜利渡过了灾荒。先锋农业生产合作社社长殷振武等说：去年我们村连一成年景都不到，可是没有一个人受冻挨饿。今年春天社里要播种的时候没有种籽，国家及时贷给一千六百万元，帮我们买回两万二千斤从外地运来的小麦、莜麦等种籽。要不是国家和各地农民兄弟们的支援，今年别说丰收啦，就连地也种不上呢！这个农业生产合作社决定集体卖给国家三十五万斤余粮。全县许多农户一次就卖给国家二、三千斤粮食，各地收购站有时候一天能收购粮食十万多斤。据十一月四日不完全的统计，全县农民已经卖给国家一千三百六十七万斤余粮。十一月三日，县人民代表大会会议作出决议，全县准备卖给国家一亿零四百二十三万斤余粮。

    农业生产合作社的模范作用
    山西省潞安县三百五十九个农业生产合作社今年秋田每亩产量达到二百三十八斤，超过全县平均产量十一斤六两，超过互助组产量九斤三两。这些农业生产合作社不但在生产中显示了优越性，在卖余粮的时候也表现得特别踊跃。现在他们已经卖给国家六百三十一万多斤余粮。其中琚寨农业生产合作社集体卖粮十三万七千多斤，比去年卖粮数量增加一倍。河头农业生产合作社今年种的谷子每亩平均产二百八十九斤，比去年增产四十二斤，社员收入普遍增加，卖给国家的余粮有十四万斤。魏家庄农业生产合作社社员魏仁群过去是缺粮户，今年参加了农业生产合作社以后也成了余粮户。他已经初步决定要卖五百斤余粮。　（任卿等）
    出售棉花的热潮
    陕西省泾阳县今年播种的三十三万多亩棉花，据初步估算，每亩产量可以比去年增产百分之二十到三十。从九月份以来，各地农民都踊跃地把棉花卖给国家。符家堡村红星农业生产合作社，今年预计可收获皮棉一万四千五百多斤，现在已经卖给国家一万一千多斤。十月底前后，第二区永乐店镇每天上市棉花平均有七万多斤，超过了这个镇历年来棉花上市量的最高纪录。全县十四个收花站，截至十一月五日的统计，已经收进皮棉八百八十九万五千多斤，超过了九、十两月收购任务百分之二点七，比去年同时期的收购量高出百分之十四。
    为了使纺织工厂能够生产出更多更好的布疋，许多农民在出售棉花以前，仔细进行了拣晒。史王村农业生产合作社卖给国家的七千四百八十多斤皮棉中，中级棉只有七百多斤，其他的都是上级棉。往年泾阳县收购的棉花，杂质平均都在百分之一点八以上，有些甚至还达到百分之三，今年杂质一般都在百分之一点五左右。
    遵守预购合同，积极出售油料
    山东省盛产花生的济宁、胶州等专区的农民，正积极按照预购合同，向供销合作社交售花生。滕县第四区的农民在十月二十五日一天，就把国家预购的十一万多斤花生米送到供销合作社。除了履行合同以外，农民们另外还卖给国家大批油料。十一月初，胶州专区的日照、诸城等五县已经收购花生四千多万斤；济宁专区的滕县、曲阜等五县，到十一月三日已经收购花生米一百二十七万多斤，花生三十万余斤。文登县在十一月十五日到二十日举行的县人民代表大会会议，还作出决议要组织全县农民出售三千零七十万斤花生米。
      不再把花生浪费掉
    湖北省老革命根据地红安县农民积极地把花生卖给国家。据十一月五日的统计，全县供销合作社就已经收购花生三百三十万斤。
    红安县农民在解放以后，逐渐医好了过去遭受蒋贼残酷迫害的创伤，生活越过越好。这个县本来盛产花生，每年的产量约有一千万斤，但是最近一两年卖出来的很少，根据典型调查，农民们卖出的花生不到产量的四分之一。农民们留下的花生，许多都用来招待客人，或者作早餐菜肴。今年，红安县农民受到关于国家过渡时期总任务的教育，参观了县文化馆举办的工农业建设和人民生活改善的图片展览以后，纷纷表示要尽量把花生卖给国家，支援国家工业建设，支援解放台湾。杏花乡前进农业生产合作社社长胡学为去年留了两竹箩花生，一个
  “正月”就吃完了，今年他只留了十五斤。全社经过精打细算，比去年少耗用花生九百斤以上。
