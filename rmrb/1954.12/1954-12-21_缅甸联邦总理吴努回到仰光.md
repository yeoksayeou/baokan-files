On the 17th, he told reporters in Phnom Penh that he left China deeply convinced of the Chinese people's desire for peace. He said that China's sole purpose is to rebuild its own country and that its policies are in line with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. When talking about the Taiwan issue, Prime Minister U Nu said that the Chinese people consider Taiwan to be a part of China, "just as the United States considers New York State to be one of its states," and he felt the same way about this.
