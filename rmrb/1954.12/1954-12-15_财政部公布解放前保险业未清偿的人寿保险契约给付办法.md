    The Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China decided to announce on the 15th the "Measures for Payment of Outstanding Life Insurance Contracts from Pre-Liberation Insurance Industry." According to the provisions of these measures, life insurance contracts from the former Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will be handled for registration by designated postal and telecommunications institutions in relevant cities. Life insurance contracts from the puppet Central Trust Bureau, the former China Insurance Company, and the China Life Insurance Company will be handled for registration by the People's Insurance Company of China and the China Insurance Company. Life insurance contracts from all private insurance companies (including foreign insurance companies) will be registered and settled by the original company or its authorized agent. The registration period will begin ten days after the announcement of these measures and will last for three months.
    Like depositors in pre-liberation banks and money shops, life insurance policyholders suffered serious losses due to the Kuomintang reactionary government's hyperinflation. Considering that the pre-liberation life insurance policyholders are related to the vital interests of the people, the People's Government stipulated in Article 11 of the former Central People's Government Government Administration Council's Measures for Payment of Outstanding Deposits in Pre-Liberation Banks and Money Shops in February 1953 that "Pre-liberation life insurance may be cleared by the People's Insurance Company of China with reference to the standards set in these measures."
    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the head office of the People's Insurance Company of China have jointly designated postal, telecommunications, and insurance institutions in sixty-four cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Bengbu, Fuzhou, Jinan, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Taiyuan, Wuhan, Changsha, Nanchang, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou, Nanning, Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming, Ya'an, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xining, Urumqi, Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Chengde, and Hohhot, to handle the registration work.

    财政部公布解放前保险业未清偿的人寿保险契约给付办法
    中华人民共和国财政部决定于十五日公布“解放前保险业未清偿的人寿保险契约给付办法”。根据这项办法的规定，前邮政储金汇业局的寿险契约，指定有关城市的邮电机构负责办理登记，伪中央信托局、前中国保险公司和中国人寿保险公司的寿险契约，指定由中国人民保险公司和中国保险公司负责办理登记；各私营保险公司（包括外商保险公司）的寿险契约，一律由原公司或其委托的代理人登记清偿。登记时期自这个办法公布后十日起开始，期限为三个月。
    解放前人寿保险的保户和银钱业的存户一样，由于国民党反动政府的恶性通货膨胀受到了严重损失。人民政府鉴于解放前人寿保险的保户关系到人民群众的切身利益，因此在一九五三年二月，前中央人民政府政务院关于解放前银钱业未清偿存款给付办法第十一条就作了“解放前人寿保险得由中国人民保险公司参照本办法另定标准清理之”的规定。
    现邮电部和中国人民保险公司总公司已经共同指定了北京、天津、上海、南京、蚌埠、福州、济南、保定、张家口、太原、武汉、长沙、南昌、郑州、广州、南宁、重庆、贵阳、昆明、雅安、西安、兰州、西宁、乌鲁木齐、沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、承德、呼和浩特等六十四个城市的邮电、保险机构办理登记工作。
