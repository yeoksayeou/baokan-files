    Where is the Problem?
    —A Record of the Discussions on the So-called "Grain Shortage" Issue at the People's Congress Meeting in Supo Township
    Zhou Anrang

    From September 17th to 21st, Supo Township in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, held the fourth meeting of its first People's Congress to discuss the work of unified grain purchase and supply.

    The meeting used accounting to discuss the benefits of implementing unified grain purchase and supply for the country and the peasants. It calculated the huge losses suffered by the country and the peasants in the spring and summer of this year due to the blind following of saboteurs in making trouble about the "grain shortage." It found the root cause of the "grain shortage" problem, enabling the representatives to draw a clear line between themselves and the enemy in their thinking and to raise their socialist consciousness. Township cadres also attended the meeting and received the same education. After the meeting, meetings were held throughout the township in mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives. People's representatives and cadres conveyed the situation of the township People's Congress meeting; meetings of youth, women, and the elderly were also held to widely and deeply publicize the policy of unified purchase and supply to the masses. While carrying out propaganda and education work, the actual output was ascertained and democratic appraisal was conducted. By October 20th, the whole township had completed the unified purchase task of two million jin of rice ahead of schedule.

    In order to do a good job in this year's autumn grain purchase work, the fourth meeting of the Supo Township People's Congress studied in detail the situation since the implementation of the unified grain purchase and supply policy, and found the real reasons why some farmers were making trouble about the "grain shortage," so as to conduct propaganda and education to the masses. According to the calculations of the representatives, Supo Township's total income last year was 10,078,000 jin of rice and 870,000 jin of wheat. After paying public grain, public land rent, land certificate fees, township self-raised funds, water conservancy funds, etc., there were 6,917,000 jin of rice and 610,000 jin of wheat left. Last autumn, a total of 2,060,000 jin of rice was sold in the market and by the state through unified purchase. After selling the grain, 25,616 jin of grain was returned, and the township had a total of 4,883,000 jin of rice and 610,000 jin of wheat left for food. The whole township had a total of 12,287 people, with an average of about 397 jin of rice and more than 49 jin of wheat per person. During the unified purchase and supply, the government also supplied 400,000 jin of rice. The representatives knew that an average of 370 jin of grain per person per year was more than enough, but last year each person had an average of 446 jin of grain, and they still made trouble about the "grain shortage." Everyone understood that the root cause of the "grain shortage" was definitely not that too much was purchased or too little was supplied, so they turned around and tried to find the real reason. While looking for the reason, the representatives revealed that 72 out of the 74 rich peasant households in the township were clamoring for a "grain shortage" and were engaged in panic buying and reselling. All the 13 controlled elements and 83 landlords in the township, except for three landlords, made trouble about the "grain shortage" and took the opportunity to instigate backward peasants. Zhang Shaoan, a rich peasant in Kuaihuo Village, had 30 mu of land and had a surplus of more than ten dan of rice every year. Every year when he harvested grain, he would block the road to buy four or five dan of grain to hoard and engage in speculation and exploitation. Last year, when the unified grain purchase was implemented, the masses assessed that he should sell 20,000 jin of rice, but he only sold 4,000 jin. As soon as the unified purchase work ended, he clamored for a "grain shortage," defrauded the peasants of supply certificates, resold 330 jin of rice, and rushed to Chengdu to buy more than 2,000 jin of corn and sweet potatoes. When transplanting rice seedlings, he pushed a cart and carried a bag to Qingyang Palace to rush to buy grain, shouting all the way: "Qingyang Palace is opening its granary to sell rice today, 20 jin per person for big and small families, go buy it quickly!" He incited more than a thousand farmers along the road to go to the Qingyang Palace warehouse to demand grain. Wu Shichun, a landlord in Tianling Village, while reselling state grain himself, also instigated seven farmers to resell state grain. Liu Zhenggen, a grain merchant in Caiqiao Village, should have sold more than 500 jin of wheat to the state, but he not only did not sell it, but ground it into flour and secretly sold it to the peasants, charging 300 yuan more per jin than the listed price. Fu Menglin, a controlled element in Taian Village, rushed to buy more than 2,000 jin of rice, corn, and noodles. He incited the peasants, saying: "You are too honest. As farmers, just say you don't have food and want to buy grain, what are you afraid of? I am not afraid! As long as you have money, buy everything back." Urban speculators and profiteers also used various methods to entice peasants, engaging in speculation and exploitation. Gan Ziyun, a people's representative in Huangtu Village, confessed: "After the unified purchase, the state supplied me with 900 jin of rice, and I lent 240 jin to others because I couldn't finish it. But when there was a 'grain shortage,' I also made trouble. The first time I went to Chengdu to rush to buy, because there were too many people, I didn't buy anything. When I walked to the door of a noodle shop, the boss secretly said to me: 'Come tomorrow, I'll save some noodles for you. When you come, don't ask on the shop floor, eat a cigarette, and walk straight into the house to avoid trouble with the government.' He also said, 'We merchants knew that it was difficult for you peasants to follow the general line, and we wanted to sell you noodles, but the People's Government wouldn't let us sell.' The next day I ran to Chengdu again, did as he said, and bought 16 jin of noodles. At that time, I thought 'this merchant is good.' Now I understand that he was using tricks to trap us. The noodles in the cooperative cost 1,400 yuan per jin, but the noodles he sold me cost 2,800 yuan per jin." Yang Chengde, a farmer in Gaokan Village, bought a large pumpkin weighing 18 jin at Qingyang Palace, and when he opened it, there was a large bag of water inside. Shuai Tingbin listened to the sweet potato merchant, paid a deposit first, and ran to Qingyang Palace to carry sweet potatoes at night. He bought 50 jin, but when he weighed it back, it was only 35 jin. Yang Yinguang in Huangtu Village went to Chengdu before dawn to buy 200 jin of sweet potatoes, but when he carried them home, he saw that there were many bowl-sized stones in the bottom of the basket.

    Under the influence of urban and rural capitalism and illegal landlords and remnant counter-revolutionary elements, 50% of the peasants in Supo Township followed suit and made trouble about the "grain shortage," following the panic buying and reselling, forming a tense atmosphere of "grain shortage" throughout the township. After a series of facts were revealed at this meeting, the representatives clearly realized that the essence of the "grain shortage" was that profiteers and hoarders used some backward thinking of the peasants to carry out an anti-restriction struggle, and that landlords and counter-revolutionary elements took this opportunity to carry out sabotage activities. After clarifying the essence of the "grain shortage," the representatives calculated the huge losses caused to the country and the peasants because of the "grain shortage." Among the 22 people's representatives in Tianling Village, 18 families had grain but still made trouble about the "grain shortage," running around everywhere, spending 9.44 million yuan, and eating 22 pigs and half a cow. The average loss per person was 520,000 yuan. Representative Liu Hongxing confessed: "Originally, I had enough grain to eat, but seeing the landlords and rich peasants making a fuss, and some peasants following suit, I was afraid that others would say that I 'had grain to eat,' so I sold four fat pigs, two dan of rapeseed, and three carts of bamboo, and followed others running around everywhere. All this money was wasted, and I delayed work, and production suffered. I only blame myself for being ideologically backward, not recognizing the enemy, and being fooled." The people's representatives of Huangtu Village calculated a loss account for the peasant households in their village who followed suit and made trouble about the grain shortage: the losses wasted and exploited by profiteers amounted to 75.59 million yuan. When transplanting rice seedlings was busy, one day they heard the rich peasants say that "Qingyang Palace is selling rice," and more than 50 peasants dropped their work and ran for a day, losing more than 300,000 yuan, not to mention wasting more than 50 workdays, and delaying the transplanting of rice seedlings on 40 mu of land. The result of the calculations of the 15 villages in the township was that the total loss was more than 500 million yuan, and more than 4,000 workdays were wasted. Everyone calculated that if the wasted money was used to buy oil cake (fertilizer), 760,000 jin could be bought; if the wasted labor was used to accumulate green manure, more than 2.5 million jin could be accumulated. If these fertilizers were put into production, the 25,000 mu of land in the township could be applied with an average of 30 jin more oil cake and 100 jin of grass fertilizer per mu. Each mu could produce at least 40 jin more rice, and the township could produce a total of 1 million jin more. Selling this rice to the state could feed 6,000 people for half a year, adding more strength to industrial construction; the 2,700 peasant households in the township could increase their income by an average of 270,000 yuan per household.

    Through specifically calculating the loss account, the representatives clearly saw that the result of blindly following the enemy in making trouble about the "grain shortage" was essentially to help the enemy and seriously harm the interests of the country and the peasants, thereby drawing a clear line between themselves and the enemy, and greatly increasing their socialist consciousness. Everyone consciously criticized backward thinking and expressed their determination to complete this year's unified purchase and supply task. The 241 representatives and cadres who attended the meeting reported their actual output. Luo Ziyun, a people's representative in Tianling Village, said: "Before, my eyes were blurred. When I heard others making trouble about the 'grain shortage,' I was uneasy and thought that the countryside 'lacked grain.' After this meeting, my eyes are bright. After I return to the village, I must enlighten the masses to calculate these accounts well, educate everyone to take care of the interests of national industrialization everywhere, and be vigilant against the enemy's sabotage activities. In the first half of the year, the backward peasants in the village could not say anything without mentioning 'no food to eat.' As long as the accounts are calculated well and the propaganda work is done well, it won't be long before everyone can't say anything without mentioning industrialization." Yang Yinguang, a people's representative in Huangtu Village, used to be in love with the daughter of the rich peasant Li Shangqing. Li Shangqing would shout "grain shortage" whenever he saw him. At first, he explained the benefits of unified purchase and supply to the rich peasant. Later, he was influenced by the rich peasant and thought that unified purchase and supply "tightened the peasants' belts," so he was not at ease in his work and did not attend the large and small meetings in the village, but stayed with the rich peasant all day long, helping the rich peasant with work. After attending the township People's Congress meeting this time, he realized that he had been fooled by the rich peasant. After returning to the village, he immediately exposed the tricks of the rich peasant in making trouble about the "grain shortage," and his work became active.

    问题在哪里
    ——记苏坡乡人民代表大会会议讨论所谓“缺粮”问题
    周安让
    四川省温江县苏坡乡从九月十七日到二十一日召开首届乡人民代表大会第四次会议，讨论关于粮食统购统销的工作。
    会议用算账的方式，讨论了实行粮食统购统销对国家、对农民的好处，计算了部分农民在今年春、夏两季由于盲目地跟着破坏分子闹“缺粮”，使国家和农民受到的巨大损失，找出了闹“缺粮”的根本原因，使代表们划清了敌我思想界限，提高了社会主义觉悟。乡干部也列席了这次会议，受到了同样的教育。会后，全乡以互助组、农业生产合作社为单位召开了会议，由人民代表、干部传达了乡人民代表大会会议的情况；并召开青年、妇女、老年人会议，向群众广泛深入地宣传了统购统销政策。在进行宣传教育工作同时，摸实了产量，进行了民主评议，全乡到十月二十日为止，已经提前完成了二百万斤大米的统购任务。
    为了作好今年秋季的粮食统购工作，苏坡乡人民代表大会第四次会议详细地研究了实行粮食统购统销政策以来的情况，并从中找出一部分农民闹“缺粮”的真正原因，以便向群众进行宣传教育。根据代表们的计算，苏坡乡去年共收入大米一千零七万八千多斤、小麦八十七万斤。交了公粮、公田租、土地证照费、乡自筹经费、水利经费等以后，剩下大米六百九十一万七千多斤、小麦六十一万斤。去年秋天全乡在市场上卖出的大米和国家统购的大米共二百零六万斤，卖粮后又退粮二万五千六百一十六斤，全乡合计留口粮大米四百八十八万三千多斤和小麦六十一万斤。全乡共一万二千二百八十七人，每人平均约有口粮三百九十七斤大米和四十九斤多小麦。统购统销当中，政府又供应了大米四十万斤。代表们都知道每人每年平均有三百七十斤粮，就宽余宽剩的够吃了，但去年每人平均四百四十六斤粮食，却还闹“缺粮”。大家明白了闹“缺粮”的根本原因决不是统购多了，供应少了，于是便翻来覆去找真正原因。在找原因当中，代表们揭发出全乡七十四户富农就有七十二户叫嚣“缺粮”，进行抢购套购。全乡的十三个被管制分子和八十三户地主中，除三户地主外，全部闹“缺粮”，并乘机煽动落后农民。快活村富农张绍安有三十亩田，每年要余米十几石，年年打谷子时还要在路上拦着买四、五石粮食，囤积起来，进行投机剥削。去年实行粮食统购时，群众评议他应卖米两万斤，结果他只卖出四千斤。统购工作刚结束，他就叫嚣“缺粮”，骗取农民的供应证套购大米三百三十斤，又到成都抢购玉米、红薯二千多斤。栽秧子时，他推着车子拿着口袋到青羊宫抢购，一路上大喊大叫：“青羊宫今天开仓卖米了，大口小口一人二十斤，快去买呀！”煽动沿公路一千多个农民到青羊宫仓库要求买粮。天灵村地主巫仕春在自己套购国家粮食的同时，还煽动七户农民套购国家粮食。蔡礄村碾粮商人刘正根应该卖给国家五百多斤麦子，他不但不卖，却碾成面悄悄卖给农民，每斤比牌价高三百元。泰安村被管制分子傅孟林抢购大米、玉米、挂面二千多斤。他煽动农民说：“你们太老实了，农民嘛，就说没口粮要买粮，怕啥？我还不怕哩！只要有钱，啥子都把它买回来。”城市投机奸商也用各种办法勾引农民，从中进行投机剥削。黄土村人民代表干子云检讨说：“统购后国家供应给我九百斤米，我吃不完借给别人二百四十斤。但在闹‘缺粮’时，我也跟着闹。第一回到成都去抢购，因为人多，什么都没买到手。走到一家挂面铺门口，那家老板悄悄对我说：‘你明天来，我留着面等你。来时不要在铺面上问，嘴里吃支纸烟，对直朝屋里走，免得政府打麻烦。’还说‘我们商人本来知道你们农民照着总路线走困难，想卖面给你，但就是人民政府不让卖。’第二天我又跑到成都去，照他的话做，果然买到十六斤面。那时我还认为‘这户商人好’。现在才明白他用圈圈套我们。合作社的面才一千四百元一斤，他卖给我的面，每斤足足卖了二千八百元。”高坎村农民杨成德到青羊宫买了个十八斤重的大南瓜，拿回来打开一看里面一大包水。帅廷彬听卖红薯商人的话，先交定钱，晚上跑到青羊宫背红薯，买了五十斤，回来一称才三十五斤。黄土村杨银光天不亮就到成都买了两百斤红薯，背回家才看到背篼底下装了好些碗大的石头。
    在城乡资本主义和不法地主、残余的反革命分子的影响下，苏坡乡有百分之五十的农民跟着闹“缺粮”，跟着抢购套购，形成了全乡闹“缺粮”的紧张空气。一连串的事实在这次会议上被揭发出来以后，代表们清楚地认识到闹“缺粮”的本质是奸商和囤积居奇的剥削者利用农民某些落后思想进行反限制斗争，而地主、反革命分子就利用这一机会进行破坏活动。在弄清了闹“缺粮”的本质以后，代表们清算出因为闹“缺粮”给国家和农民造成的巨大损失。天灵村二十二个人民代表中，有十八人家里有粮也跟着闹“缺粮”，到处乱跑，花费了人民币九百四十四万元，吃掉了二十二只猪和半只牛。每人平均损失五十二万元。代表刘洪兴检讨说：“本来我的粮食是够吃的，但见地主、富农闹得凶，有些农民也跟着闹，我害怕别人说我‘有粮食吃’，也卖了四只肥猪、两石菜籽和三车竹子，跟着别人到处乱跑。这些钱全浪费了，又耽搁了工，生产受了损失。只怪我思想落后，认不清敌人，上了大当。”黄土村的人民代表给本村跟着闹缺粮的农户算了一笔损失账：浪费了的和被奸商剥削的损失共达七千五百五十九万元。栽秧子正忙的时候，有一天听富农说“青羊宫卖米了”，五十几个农民丢下活跑了一天，损失三十多万元不说，还浪费了五十几个工，四十亩田的秧子也栽迟了。全乡十五个村算账的结果，共损失人民币五亿多元，浪费人工四千多个。大家计算如果把浪费的钱买油枯（肥料），可买七十六万斤；如果把浪费的人工用来积青肥，可积二百五十多万斤。要把这些肥料投入生产，全乡二万五千多亩田，平均每亩能多下油枯三十斤、草肥一百斤。每亩最低能增产四十斤米，全乡共可增产一百万斤。把这些米卖给国家，可供六千人半年食用，对工业建设就多添一分力量；全乡二千七百多户农民，每户平均能增加二十七万元的收入。
    通过具体算损失账，代表们清楚地看到盲目跟着敌人闹“缺粮”的结果，实质上是帮助了敌人，严重地危害了国家和农民的利益，从而划清了敌我界限，社会主义觉悟大大提高。大家自觉地批判了落后思想，表示坚决完成今年统购统销任务。到会的代表和列席的干部，有二百四十一人报实了自己的产量。天灵村人民代表罗子云说：“以前眼睛是模糊的，听见别人闹‘缺粮’，心头拿不稳，也认为农村‘缺粮’，开过这次会，眼睛明亮了。我回村后一定要启发群众算好这几笔账，教育大家处处照顾到国家工业化的利益，警惕敌人的破坏活动。上半年村里的落后农民是三句话不离‘没饭吃’，只要把账算好，宣传工作做好，过不了多久，大家就会三句话离不开工业化了。”黄土村人民代表杨银光以前和富农李尚清的女儿恋爱，李尚清见着他就喊“缺粮”。起初，他还向富农说明统购统销的好处。后来他受了富农的影响，也认为统购统销“把农民扣紧了”，于是不安心工作，村里的大会小会都不参加，成天和富农在一起，帮助富农干活。这次他参加乡人民代表大会会议后，认识到自己上了富农的当。回村后他立刻揭发了富农闹“缺粮”的花样，工作积极起来。
