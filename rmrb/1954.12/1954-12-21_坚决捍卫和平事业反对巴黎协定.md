    Resolutely Defend the Cause of Peace and Oppose the Paris Accords
    Mass Rallies Held Across Democratic Germany
    The people of all strata in the German Democratic Republic are resolutely opposed to the ratification of the Paris Accords, which would divide Germany and bring the threat of another world war. At massive rallies and gatherings held across the country, resolutions were passed demanding the rejection of the aggressive Paris Accords.
    Three thousand teachers and parents from various districts of Berlin gathered at the Friedrichstadt-Palast theater in Berlin on the 18th. They unanimously expressed their determination to fight against the ratification of the Paris military treaty, not to let German youth become victims of German militarism for the third time.
    In a statement issued by the famous German writer and poet Bertolt Brecht and signed by nearly fifty leading scientists, writers, and cultural workers, it was stated: "We do not recognize the Paris Accords that the Adenauer government intends to implement throughout Germany. We do not want Germany to join a war bloc because a third war would destroy Germany."
    The Central Council of the Farmers' Mutual Aid Committee Federation wrote an open letter to all farmers in West Germany, calling on them to demand that members of the state parliaments and the Bonn Federal Parliament vote against the Paris Accords.
    Joint Protest Action in West Berlin
    Members of the German Social Democratic Party and the German Socialist Unity Party of Greater Berlin jointly held a rally in Berlin on the 17th. The meeting unanimously adopted a letter to all working people of Berlin, calling on them to jointly fight against the Paris military treaty.
    French Parliamentarians Firmly Voting Against
    On the eve of the French National Assembly's debate on the Paris Accords, former French Prime Minister and prominent leader of the Radical Socialist Party, Édouard Daladier, reiterated his opposition to the rearmament of West Germany. On the 19th, Daladier said at a party meeting held by the Radical Socialist Party in Avignon that he would not vote in favor when the National Assembly votes on the Paris Accords. Daladier said: "I refuse to allow the rearmament of Germany."
    French National Assembly member André Denis (not affiliated with any parliamentary group) published a statement in the "International Forum" weekly, saying that on the eve of the parliamentary debate on the ratification of the Paris Accords, I declare that I will vote against it. I believe that particularly important international negotiations can be held at this time to resolve the German question in order to guarantee European security. It is unacceptable to ratify the plan that provides for the unilateral armament of Germany at this time.
    Lavielle says Ratifying it is Equivalent to Suicide
    The "International Forum" weekly published on the 17th contained an article by the famous French professor Lavielle. Lavielle emphasized that for France, ratifying the Paris Accords is equivalent to suicide. He said that Western countries' policies are based on a series of serious mistakes, one of which is the belief that a four-power conference can be convened after the Paris Accords are ratified. He pointed out that the Soviet government has already stated that once the Paris Accords are ratified, negotiations will no longer be meaningful. Therefore, it is unfounded to insist that the Russians will be more willing to negotiate with the West after the Paris Accords are ratified. Lavielle pointed out that ratifying the Paris Accords would deepen international tensions, expand the arms race, and undermine the cause of peace. And for France, "if the Paris Accords are ratified, France will inevitably be removed from the ranks of the great powers."
    Appeal from Czechoslovak Scientists
    A meeting of academicians of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and scientific workers of Charles University was held in Prague. The meeting unanimously supported the Moscow Conference Declaration and adopted a letter to representatives of the world's scientific community. The letter to representatives of the world's scientific community said: Peace is our common desire and goal, and it is in line with our common interests in developing science and culture. We are concerned about defending the cause of peace, and we call out: No third world war! Issue protests against the London and Paris Accords, which open up broad avenues for the militarization of West Germany! The letter to representatives of the world's scientific community especially appealed to scientists in Western Europe to strive to open the way for negotiations aimed at resolving all disputes.
    Letter from Finnish Parliamentarians to French Parliamentarians
    The Second Deputy Speaker of the Finnish Parliament, Kuijala, and some parliamentarians wrote a letter to the parliamentary groups of the French National Assembly, urging them not to ratify the Paris Accords. The letter stated: Militaristic Germany has twice brought disaster to Finland in two world wars. It has ruined thousands upon thousands of Finnish families and threatens to deprive the Finnish people of their national independence. We appeal to you on behalf of our millions of voters: "Do not let an unfortunate thing happen!"

    坚决捍卫和平事业反对巴黎协定
    民主德国各地举行群众集会
    德意志民主共和国各阶层人民坚决反对批准使德国分裂并带来另一次世界大战威胁的巴黎协定。在各地举行的声势浩大的大会和集会上都通过决定，要求拒绝侵略性的巴黎协定。
    柏林各个区的三千个教师和家长十八日在柏林腓特烈宫剧院集会，他们一致表示决心为反对批准巴黎军事协定而斗争，不让德国青年第三次成为德国军国主义的牺牲品。
    在由德国著名作家和诗人贝·布莱希特发表的、并且有近五十名大科学家、作家和文化工作者签署的一篇声明中说：“我们不承认阿登纳政府打算在全德国推行的巴黎协定。我们不愿意让德国加入战争阵营，因为第三次战争会把德国毁灭。”
    农民互助委员会联合会中央理事会给西德全体农民写了一封公开信，呼吁他们起来要求州议会和波恩联邦议院的议员投票反对巴黎协定。
    西柏林的联合抗议行动
    西柏林的德国社会民主党党员和德国统一社会党大柏林市的党员十七日联合在柏林举行集会。会议一致通过告柏林全体劳动人民书，号召柏林全体劳动人民共同为反对巴黎军事协定而斗争。
    坚决投反对票的法国议员们
    在法国国民议会辩论巴黎协定前夕，法国前总理、激进社会党著名领袖爱德华·达拉第再度表示反对武装西德。十九日，达拉第在激进社会党于亚威农地方举行的党的会议上说：在国民议会就巴黎协定举行投票的时候，他将不投赞成票。达拉第说：“我拒绝听任重新武装德国。”
    法国国民议会议员安德烈·德尼（不属于任何议会党团）在“国际论坛”周刊上发表谈话说，在议会就批准巴黎协定问题举行辩论的前夕，我声明我要投反对票。我认为目前可以举行特别重要的国际谈判来解决德国问题，以便保障欧洲安全。在这个时候批准那规定片面武装德国的计划，是不能容许的。
    拉维尔湼说批准它就等于自杀
    十七日出版的“国际论坛”周刊刊载了法国名教授拉维尔湼的文章。拉维尔湼强调：对法国来说，批准巴黎协定等于自杀。他说：西方国家的政策立足于一系列严重的错误，错误之一是认为可以在批准巴黎协定之后召开四国会议。他指出：苏联政府已经声明过，一旦批准巴黎协定，谈判就再没有意义。因此，硬说在批准巴黎协定之后俄国人会更加愿意和西方谈判，是没有根据的。拉维尔湼指出：批准巴黎协定会加深国际紧张局势，会扩大军备竞赛，并且会破坏和平事业。而对法国来说，“如果巴黎协定被批准，法国就不可避免地要从大国的行伍中被勾销”。
    捷克斯洛伐克科学家的呼吁
    布拉格举行了捷克斯洛伐克科学院院士和卡罗瓦大学科学工作者的会议，会议一致拥护莫斯科会议宣言，并通过了告全世界科学界代表书。告全世界科学界代表书说：和平是我们共同的愿望和争取的目标，它是符合我们要发展科学和文化的共同利益的。我们关心捍卫和平的事业，我们呼吁：不许发动第三次世界大战！发出反对替西德军国主义化开辟广阔道路的伦敦和巴黎协定的抗议呼声！告全世界科学界代表书特别向西欧的科学家们呼吁，要争取为举行目的在解决一切纠纷问题的谈判开辟道路。
    芬兰议员给法国议员的信
    芬兰议会第二副议长库雅拉和一些议员写了一封信给法国国民议会各议会党团，呼吁他们不要批准巴黎协定。信中说：军国主义的德国曾经在两次世界大战中使芬兰两度陷于灾难之中。它破坏了成千上万的芬兰家庭，并且有剥夺掉芬兰人民的民族独立的危险。我们代表我们千百万选民向你们呼吁：“不要让一件不幸的事情发生！”
