    Beijing Circles Hold a Rally Against the US-Chiang Treaty
    Passing Resolutions Endorsing Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement and Liberating Taiwan

    Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: People from all circles in the capital gathered on the 23rd to support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and oppose the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." Participants included representatives from various people's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties in Beijing, as well as workers, farmers, youth, women, students, ethnic minorities, religious circles, and business circles, totaling over 1,200 people.

    The conference was presided over by Qian Duansheng, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Consultative Committee. He said: The people of all circles in Beijing wholeheartedly support and fully endorse Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement to the world regarding the US-Chiang treaty. We firmly oppose aggression, firmly oppose the US-Chiang treaty, and are determined to liberate Taiwan. This is our common will.

    Zhang Youyu, Standing Committee Member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a report at the meeting, sternly pointing out: The US-Chiang treaty is a thorough and complete treaty of aggression and war. The people of our capital firmly support and endorse Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's righteous and stern statement, and are determined to fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan. If US imperialism dares to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan and carry out armed interference against our country, it will surely receive merciless punishment and a severe rebuff. Under the leadership of the People's Republic of China government, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao, the people of the entire city, along with the people of the whole country, must strive to strengthen our national defense and economic power, and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan in the same way as we supported the Liberation War and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.

    Jiang Guangnai, representative of the local organizations of democratic parties in Beijing, said at the meeting: We, the members of the democratic parties in Beijing, vow to strengthen our work in all aspects together with the people of the whole country and shoulder the sacred responsibility of defending the motherland and defending Asian and world peace. Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, representing the city's workers, expressed the need to further develop labor emulation drives, strive to comprehensively complete the national production plan, and do a good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, contributing all our strength to liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

    Hou Decheng, Beijing model worker and shift foreman of the No. 2 blast furnace at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said at the meeting: We, the workers of the city, feel extremely indignant at this blatant act of aggression by US imperialism. All the employees of our steel plant are determined to produce an additional 15,000 tons of pig iron for the country before the end of this year. Yin Weichen, Beijing agricultural labor model and director of the Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative, representing the city's farmers, said: We must actively develop mutual aid and cooperation organizations, strive for a bumper harvest, sell large quantities of agricultural products to the country, and actively support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Guan Shixiong, representing the city's youth, said: We, the youth of the city, must actively work, study hard, exercise, and be prepared to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. Lin Qiaozhi, representing the city's women and mothers, said: We women love peace. The women of the capital firmly oppose the US-Chiang treaty that is preparing for war, and are determined to wage an unyielding struggle to liberate the suffering women and children of Taiwan. Jiao Juyin, representative of the literary and art circles, said: We literary and art workers must exert even greater efforts and resolutely smash the US-Chiang treaty. Le Songsheng, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: We will never forget the devastation and plunder of industrialists and merchants during the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's rule of the mainland. The city's industrialists and merchants must distinguish between friend and foe, abide by national policies and laws, obey national plans, actively engage in production and management, and contribute to the liberation of Taiwan.

    The conference unanimously passed a resolution at the end. The resolution stated that the US-Chiang treaty is a blatant manifestation of US imperialism's shameless violation of China's territory and sovereignty. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which has been spurned by the Chinese people, has absolutely no right to sign any treaty with foreign countries. We, the people of all circles in Beijing, resolutely oppose this treaty and are prepared to respond to any provocative acts by the enemy at any time.

   Xinhua News Agency: At the rally of people from all walks of life in Beijing in support of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and against the US-Chiang "Common Defense Treaty", the resolution "Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement, resolutely opposing the US-Chiang treaty, and being determined to liberate Taiwan" was unanimously adopted. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

    The so-called "common defense treaty" signed by US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a serious war provocation by US imperialism against the Chinese people, and a blatant manifestation of US imperialism's shameless violation of China's territory and sovereignty. We, the people of all circles in Beijing, are extremely indignant at this criminal act by US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "common defense treaty". We oppose war, but we will never be intimidated by the threat of war; we demand peace, but we will never beg for peace at the cost of territory. If anyone dares to impose war on us, we must give him a severe punishment!

    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which has been spurned by the Chinese people, has absolutely no right to sign any treaty with foreign countries. The so-called US-Chiang "common defense treaty" is completely illegal and invalid. We, the people of all circles in Beijing, firmly oppose this treaty and, together with the people of the whole country, vigilantly watch the conspiracies of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and are prepared to respond to any provocative acts by the enemy at any time. We once again express our determination: We must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique! We vow to strengthen unity, overcome difficulties, do a good job in all our work, and strive to complete the national construction plan with practical actions to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan in order to defend peace in Asia and the world.
