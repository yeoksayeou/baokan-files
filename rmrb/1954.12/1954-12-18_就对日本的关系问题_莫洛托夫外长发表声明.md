Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: TASS Moscow, December 16th: Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov issued a statement on relations with Japan, the full text of which is as follows:

    Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu recently issued a formal statement on the foreign policy to be adopted by the new Japanese government led by Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama. In this statement, Mr. Shigemitsu specifically expressed the Japanese new government's willingness to restore normal relations with the Soviet Union under mutually acceptable conditions, although he made some reservations.

    In this regard, it should be pointed out that the Soviet Union has always strived to establish and develop relations with all countries, provided they express a willingness to do so. The Soviet Union also pursues this policy towards Japan, believing that the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Japan is not only in the interests of the two countries concerned, but also in the interests of other countries that hope to consolidate peace in the Far East and ease international tensions.

    The Soviet government's attitude towards normalizing relations with Japan has been expressed in the Joint Declaration of the Soviet Government and the Government of the People's Republic of China on relations with Japan, published on October 12 this year. As everyone knows, this declaration expresses the Soviet Union's willingness to normalize relations with Japan, develop trade with it on mutually beneficial terms, and establish cultural ties.

    The Soviet government expresses its agreement with Mr. Shigemitsu's above-mentioned statement on Japan-Soviet relations. The Soviet government, for its part, is prepared to discuss practical measures to normalize relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, if the Japanese government truly wishes to take steps in this direction.

    就对日本的关系问题
    莫洛托夫外长发表声明
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫就对日本的关系问题发表声明，全文如下：
    日本外务相重光葵先生前几天就鸠山一郎首相领导的日本新政府所要采取的外交政策发表了正式声明。在这篇声明中，重光葵先生具体表示日本新政府愿意在彼此可以接受的条件下恢复同苏联的正常关系，虽然他作了一些保留。
    在这方面应该指出，苏联是始终在努力和所有国家建立和发展关系的，只要它们表示愿意这样做。苏联对日本也是奉行着这种政策，相信苏联和日本关系的正常化不仅符合有关两国的利益，而且也符合其他希望巩固远东和平和缓和国际紧张局势的国家的利益。
    苏联政府关于使对日本的关系正常化的态度，已经在今年十月十二日发表的苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言中表示出来。大家知道，这个宣言表示苏联愿意使同日本的关系正常化，在互利的条件下发展对它的贸易，并且建立文化联系。
    苏联政府表示赞同重光葵先生关于日本—苏联关系的上述声明。苏联政府这方面准备讨论关于使苏联和日本之间的关系正常化的切实可行的措施，如果日本政府真正希望在这方面采取步骤的话。
