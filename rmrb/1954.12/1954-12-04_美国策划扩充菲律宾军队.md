Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: A news item from the Associated Press on November 29th reveals that the U.S.-planned reorganization and expansion of the Philippine armed forces is being stepped up. The news item states that, according to the agreement concluded between the two sides in September, the U.S. Department of Defense and the Philippine Army General Headquarters are drafting detailed plans to reorganize the twenty-six battalions of the Philippine Army into four divisions. Plans to expand the Philippine Air Force and Navy are also being prepared.

The news points out that the purpose of reorganizing the Philippine Army is to prepare for the possibility of deploying these troops to other parts of Southeast Asia "according to the obligations of the Manila Treaty."

The news also states that the Philippines' current military expenditure already accounts for one-third of the Philippine budget. The Philippine government also believes that further increasing the military burden will inevitably further endanger the Philippine economy.

The news reveals that Romulo, the private envoy of Philippine President Magsaysay, who is currently in the United States, recently visited senior officials of the U.S. Department of Defense in succession, which is related to the Philippines' request for increased "aid" from the United States in this regard.

    美国策划扩充菲律宾军队
    【新华社二日讯】　据美联社十一月二十九日发出的一条消息透露，美国策划的整编和扩充菲律宾武装部队的工作，正加紧进行中。这条消息说：根据双方在九月间缔结的协定，美国国防部和菲律宾陆军总司令部正在草拟详细方案，以便把二十六个营的菲律宾陆军改编为四个师。扩充菲律宾空军和海军的计划也正在准备中。
    消息指出，整编菲律宾陆军的目的，是准备有可能把这些军队“根据马尼拉条约的义务调到东南亚其他地方去使用”。
    消息又说，菲律宾目前的军费已经占菲律宾预算开支的三分之一。菲律宾政府方面也认为：进一步加重军费负担，不会不进一步危害菲律宾的经济。
    消息透露，目前在美国的菲律宾总统麦格赛赛的私人使节罗慕洛最近接连访问美国国防部高级官员，同菲律宾要求美国在这一方面增加“援助”有关系。
