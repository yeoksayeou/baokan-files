To the Editor:

We, the workers of the railway track-laying engineering team in New China, deeply feel honored and happy! It is we who carried the sleepers on our shoulders to the roadbed; it is we who connected the steel rails one by one with our own hands; it is we who tightened the screws and hammered in the spikes, so that the people's train can gallop on the new railway line, bringing prosperity and happiness to the desolate places.

We understand the great significance of building the Jining-Erlian railway for consolidating national defense, developing the economy, and strengthening national unity; at the same time, we also understand how important our task is as the "special forces" in railway construction!

In the fourth quarter of this year, the task assigned to us by our superiors is: to lay an average of 2.8 kilometers of track per day and to lay the track to Erlian on the Sino-Mongolian border before December 25th. If the steel rails cannot be laid on the roadbed as planned, a large number of materials cannot be transported to the site in time, and the station platforms and other projects along the line cannot be completed on schedule! It can be said that everyone is watching us!

We cannot fail to live up to everyone's expectations! And we have indeed not failed to live up to everyone's expectations! In the severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius, in the wind and sand of the grasslands, and under the difficult conditions of water and material shortages, we have achieved a decisive victory!

The climate in the desert area is ever-changing: when the sun comes out at noon, you can take off all but one layer of clothing and still be drenched in sweat, but suddenly the sky changes, and you can put on a fur coat and still shiver from the cold. The hot breath exhaled from your mouth immediately freezes into ice on your earmuffs, lips, and eyebrows, turning young lads into white-haired old men; when the wind blows, sand and stones fly all over the sky, making it impossible to open your eyes or straighten your neck. The mobility of the track-laying engineering team is very high. At six o'clock in the morning, when the cold is ruling the grasslands, we go to work ten or twenty miles away in the face of the biting cold wind. When we return in the evening, the northwest wind howls even more fiercely. It is in this environment that our track-laying workers are constantly creating miracles!

The planned quota for a team carrying sleepers is 32 per person per day, but the temporary worker Chang Yinwan carried 71; the daily plan for the rail-pulling team was 512 steel rails, but it has now been increased to 538. Liao Dongfa invented the "flatcar unloading device," which replaced heavy physical labor, extended the life of the flatcar, and prevented damage to the subgrade slope; Xue Hanchao and Zhang Jianmin created the "sleeper spacing line," which eliminated the phenomenon of wasted work. The comrades said, "The wind and sand are strong, but not as strong as our strength!" "There are many difficulties, but not as many as our wisdom!" "The cold weather can't freeze the hearts of the track-laying workers!" It is this heroic spirit that ensures that the track extends rapidly forward day by day.

In the first half of November, we actually laid an average of 3.3 kilometers of track per day, and the highest labor productivity reached 10.42 meters per worker per day on the main line. As of November 25th, we have laid 307 kilometers of track. Between the track-laying engineering team and Erlian, the border terminus, only Xilin Station remains. No matter how difficult the remaining journey is, we have full confidence in guaranteeing that the steel rails will be laid to the terminus before December 10th, so that the friendship train of socialist countries can gallop on the vast grasslands of the motherland as soon as possible.

### 让社会主义列车奔驰在祖国的草原上

    让社会主义列车奔驰在祖国的草原上编辑同志：
    生活在新中国的铁路钉道工程队的职工，深深地感到光荣和幸福！是我们用自己的肩膀把枕木扛到路基上；是我们用自己的双手把钢轨一根根地接好；是我们把螺丝拧紧，把道钉钉牢，让人民的列车奔驰在新的铁路线上，把繁荣和幸福带到荒凉的地方。
    我们懂得修建集（宁）二（连）线铁路对于巩固国防、发展经济和加强民族团结的重大意义；同时我们也懂得作为建设铁路中的“特种兵”它的任务多么重大！
    今年第四季度，上级给我们的任务是：平均每日铺轨二点八公里，在十二月二十五日以前把轨道铺到中蒙边境的二连。如果钢轨不能按计划铺到路基上，大批的器材和物资就不能及时运往现场，沿线的站台和其他工程都无法按期施工！可以说，大家的眼光都在瞧着我们呀！
    我们不能辜负大家的热望！我们也的确没有辜负大家的热望！在零下二十几度的严寒里，在草原的大风沙中，在水源缺乏、物资不足的困难情况下，我们取得了决定性的胜利！
    沙漠地带的气候是变化千万：中午太阳出来时，脱剩一件单衣还汗流浃背，忽然天色一变，穿上皮袄还冷得发抖，口里吐出来的热呼气，在卷耳皮帽上、嘴唇上、眉毛上马上冻成冰，把年轻小伙子扮成了白发老人；刮起大风来，漫天飞沙走石，叫人不敢睁开眼睛，也不敢把脖子伸直。钉道工程队的流动性很大，早晨六点钟，正是寒冷统治着草原的时候，我们迎着刺骨的冷风到十里、二十里以外的现场干活去。晚上回来时，西北风呼啸得更凶。我们钉道工人就在这样的环境下，不断创造奇迹！
    小队扛枕木的计划数字是每天每人三十二根，临时工常银万却扛了七十一根；拉铁班日计划是五百一十二根钢轨，现在已提高到五百三十八根。廖东发发明了“平车上卸器”，代替了繁重的体力劳动，延长平车寿命，不再砸坏路基平坡；薛汉朝、张建民创造“散布枕木距离线”，消灭了窝工现象。同志们说：“风沙大，没有我们力量大！”“困难多，没有我们智慧多！”“天寒地冻，冻不了钉道工人的心！”正是这种英勇豪迈的气概，保证轨道日日迅速地向前伸展。
    十一月上半月，我们实际上已经做到平均每日铺轨三点三公里，劳动生产率最高达到一个工人一天在正线上进度十公尺点四二。到十一月二十五日止，我们已经铺轨三百零七公里。在钉道工程队和国境终点站二连之间，现在只留下一个西林车站了。那怕剩下来的这段路程怎样艰苦，我们有充分的信心保证在十二月十日以前把钢轨铺到终点站，让社会主义国家的友谊列车早日奔驰在祖国辽阔的大草原上。
