    Self-Study Activities of Shenyang Elementary School Graduates
    In Shenyang City, 2,730 elementary school graduates have already joined self-study groups to learn. They regularly review arithmetic, Chinese language, and other courses, and engage in various beneficial activities such as cultural entertainment. The Heping District has organized counselors to strengthen learning guidance for the self-study groups, helping to solve problems encountered in learning. Counselors in districts such as Beishi and Dadong are also setting aside time to cultivate model groups, and then organizing the group leaders to observe, so that each group leader understands how to organize the group for learning. Cultural centers in various districts are also cooperating with the self-study groups by opening children's book reading rooms and lending books needed by the students.
