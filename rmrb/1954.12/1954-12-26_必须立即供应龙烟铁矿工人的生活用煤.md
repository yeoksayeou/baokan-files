To the Editor:

    We are workers from the Longyan Iron Mine in Hebei Province. We urgently request your help in resolving a serious problem currently existing in the lives of the vast majority of workers in the entire mine.

    The Longyan Iron Mine is located on a high mountain over 1,000 meters above sea level. Recently, the temperature here has dropped to around minus twenty degrees Celsius, and everyone needs coal fires for heating. However, at this very moment, the supply of coal for workers' daily life has been cut off. Originally, the daily life coal for several thousand workers in our mine was supplied uniformly by the cooperative. Now, the cooperative has no coal left. Unless the workers take time off work to carry coal from Xuanhua, which is dozens of miles away, the coal problem cannot be solved in the mountain valleys. Currently, the cold weather is seriously threatening the lives of the workers. Take the Xiaoxishan West District One area where we live, for example, many workers' families have run out of coal long ago. During the day, family members hold their children and squeeze into the homes of workers who have coal to keep warm, and at night they can only go home and suffer in the cold, with the children crying from the cold; some workers can't even get a meal when they return home from work. The situation in other areas is no better than in our West District One. Some people have no choice but to steal coal and pick up wood everywhere to burn for fire. It is said that some pit props in the mine have also been taken away and used as firewood. The workers are generally uneasy, and some individuals have lost the will to work. If this problem is not resolved immediately, it will seriously affect production.

    Editor, the situation of insufficient supply of daily life coal has been occurring in the Longyan Iron Mine for more than a month. The workers have repeatedly requested the leaders of the iron mine to help solve the problem. The leaders of the mine said that they would quickly find a solution; the workers have constantly raised opinions to the cooperative, and the cooperative also said that it has contacted the Coal Construction Company and railway units; but the problem has not been solved. Isn't this phenomenon contradictory to the principles of supporting industrial construction and caring for the lives of workers?

### 必须立即供应龙烟铁矿工人的生活用煤

    必须立即供应龙烟铁矿工人的生活用煤编辑同志：
    我们是河北省龙烟铁矿的工人。我们迫切地要求你们帮助我们解决目前全矿广大工人生活中存在的一个严重问题。
    龙烟铁矿在海拔一千多公尺的高山上，最近这里的气温已低到零下二十度左右，大家需要煤火取暖。但是，正在这个时候，工人生活用煤却供应不上了。原来，我们矿里好几千工人的生活用煤，都是由合作社统一供应的。现在合作社没有煤了，工人们除非自己不上班到几十里远的宣化去背煤，在山沟里是解决不了煤的问题的。目前，寒冷已经严重地威胁了工人的生活。拿我们所住的小西山西一区这一带来说，不少工人家里早没有煤了，家属们白天抱着孩子挤在有煤的工人家里去取暖，晚上只能回家挨冻，小孩子冷得直哭；有些工人下班回家还吃不上饭。其它地区的情形也不比我们西一区强。有的人实在没办法，只能到处偷煤拣木材来烧火。据说矿里有一部分坑木也被人拿走当柴火用了。工人们普遍情绪不安，个别人已经无心于工作。这个问题如不立即解决，将会严重影响生产。
    编辑同志，生活用煤供应不上的情况，在龙烟铁矿出现已有一个多月了。工人们几次要求铁矿领导方面协助解决，矿里的领导同志说要赶快想办法；工人们不断向合作社提意见，合作社也说已经同煤建公司和铁路单位联系；可是问题就一直没解决。这种现象不是和支援工业建设，关心工人生活的道理相矛盾吗？王志清  张元明
