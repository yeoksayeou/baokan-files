The Chinese Writers Association held a gathering
	Commemorating the 200th Anniversary of Wu Jingzi's Death

	December 11th marked the 200th anniversary of the death of Wu Jingzi, a great realist writer in Chinese history. The Chinese Writers Association held a commemoration meeting on this day.

	More than 800 people attended the commemoration meeting, including heads of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Writers Association, the Chinese Musicians Association, the Chinese Artists Association, the Chinese Dramatists Association, the Chinese departments of various universities in Beijing, and the literary and artistic groups of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as other literary and artistic figures, people from the press and publishing circles, and foreign guests.

	Wu Jingzi was born in 1701 and died in 1754. His works include "Anthology of Poems and Prose from Wenmu Mountain Villa" and "Shishuo" (now lost). In addition, there is the full-length novel "The Scholars," which has been loved by the people for two hundred years.

	The commemoration meeting was presided over by Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association. In his opening remarks, he said: The full-length novel "The Scholars" written by Wu Jingzi has had a profound impact for two hundred years; it ruthlessly exposed the corruption and ignorance of the feudal ruling class at that time, sarcastically satirized the literati who made a living under the "eight-legged essay" system, and especially enthusiastically praised the "little people" from the bottom of society who were full of rebellious spirit and creative talent. He said that the progressive ideas expressed in "The Scholars" cannot be fully evaluated for the historical value and practical significance of this outstanding novel without linking them to Wu Jingzi's background, education, and the political and social environment of his time. Wu Jingzi came from a feudal landlord-bureaucrat family. His sharp criticism of the "eight-legged essay examination" system and his satirical ridicule of those corrupt and ignorant literati were all based on Wu Jingzi's personal experience and the result of great mental pain and ideological struggle. This is where the authenticity of the realistic masterpiece "The Scholars" lies.

	Mao Dun pointed out that Wu Jingzi's loves and hates were quite distinct. He lived in an era when the rule of the Manchu dynasty was gradually consolidated and reached its so-called heyday, but he wrote "The Scholars," using the story of the Ming dynasty to describe the corrupt and ugly essence of the feudal dynasty in the "peaceful and prosperous age" of the Qing dynasty. It is especially worth noting that the "little people" from the bottom of society written by Wu Jingzi are mostly simple, kind, and warm-hearted good people. Wu Jingzi used admiring strokes to write them vividly. If Wu Jingzi did not have a genuine understanding and love for these characters from the bottom of society, it would not have been possible to write them with such flesh and blood and distinct personalities.

	Mao Dun said that although the era we live in is very different from Wu Jingzi's era, this classic Chinese realist work is not only loved by us today, but also has many things we can learn from, such as his outstanding artistic achievements in exposing contradictions, whipping corruption and backwardness, and praising the noble qualities of the people, including the creation of typical characters and the refined and beautiful literary language and unique style.

	Mao Dun finally said that although Wu Jingzi's thoughts were limited by the times and had limitations, the love and hate he expressed in "The Scholars" reflected the corrupt and ugly essence of the feudal dynasty. We clearly see the tendency of this realistic masterpiece, and we should evaluate "The Scholars" from these main aspects. This is why we solemnly commemorate the 200th anniversary of the death of Wu Jingzi, the author of "The Scholars."

	After Mao Dun's opening remarks, He Qifang, Deputy Director of the Classical Literature Department of the Chinese Writers Association, gave a report on "Wu Jingzi's Novel 'The Scholars'." Based on the content of "The Scholars," he analyzed the ugly things in the feudal society criticized by Wu Jingzi, Wu Jingzi's background, his character of not compromising with the dark and corrupt feudal society and not bowing to poverty, his respect for individuality, and his belief that it is noble to support oneself by labor. He said that satire is a prominent feature of the novel "The Scholars," and this novel has reached a very high level in classical works in terms of artistic expression. We should still learn from this masterpiece today.

	After He Qifang's report, Zhang Kai, Wang Fulin, and Cai Xiang of the Broadcasting Drama Troupe of the Central People's Broadcasting Station recited several parts of "The Scholars."

### 中国作家协会集会  纪念吴敬梓逝世二百周年

    中国作家协会集会
    纪念吴敬梓逝世二百周年
    十一日是我国历史上伟大的现实主义作家吴敬梓逝世二百周年纪念日，中国作家协会在这一天举行了纪念会。
    参加纪念会的，有中国文学艺术界联合会、中国作家协会、中国音乐家协会、中国美术家协会、中国戏剧家协会、北京各高等学校中文系和中国人民解放军各文艺团体的负责人，以及其他文学艺术界人士、新闻出版界人士，外宾等共八百多人。
    吴敬梓生于公元一七零一年，死于公元一七五四年。他的著作有“文木山房诗文集”、“诗说”（已佚）。此外就是流传二百年来深受人民喜爱的长篇小说“儒林外史”。
    纪念会由中国作家协会主席茅盾主持。他致开会词说：吴敬梓写的长篇小说“儒林外史”，二百年来影响深远；它无情地暴露了当时封建统治阶级的腐朽和愚昧，辛辣地讽刺了当时的在“八股制艺”下讨生活的文人，特别是它热情地赞美了来自社会底层的富于反抗精神和创造才能的“小人物”。他说，表现在“儒林外史”中的进步思想，如果不和吴敬梓的身世、教养，以及他那个时代的政治社会环境联系起来看，便不能充分地评量这一部杰出的小说的历史价值和它的现实的意义。吴敬梓出身于封建地主官僚的家庭，他对于“八股取士”制度的尖锐抨击，对于那些腐朽、愚昧的文人们的辛辣的嘲讽，在吴敬梓都是切身的经验，都是付出了极大的精神痛苦和思想斗争的代价以后所得到的认识。现实主义杰作的“儒林外史”的真实性，其根源就在这里。
    茅盾指出，吴敬梓的爱憎是颇为分明的。他生活在满清皇朝的统治逐渐巩固而且达到所谓全盛的时代，却写了“儒林外史”，借明朝的故事而描写清朝“太平盛世”的封建皇朝的腐朽、丑恶的本质。特别值得注意的是，吴敬梓笔下所写的那些来自社会底层的“小人物”，大都是朴质、善良、热心肠的好人。吴敬梓用了赞美的笔调把他们写得栩栩如生。如果吴敬梓对于这些来自社会底层的人物没有真切的了解，没有热爱，便不可能把他们写得这样有血有肉，性格鲜明。
    茅盾说，我们所处的时代，虽然和吴敬梓的时代大不相同，而这一部中国古典的现实主义的作品，在今天，不但为我们所爱好，而且还有不少可供我们学习的东西，这就是他的暴露矛盾、鞭挞腐化的和落后的，赞美人民的高贵品质的卓越的艺术成就，包括创造典型和文学语言的洗练优美以及独特的风格。
    茅盾最后说，吴敬梓的思想虽然受到了时代的限制，有局限性，但是他在“儒林外史”中所表现的爱和憎，反映了封建皇朝的腐朽、丑恶的本质，我们分明看到了这部现实主义杰作的倾向性，我们应当从这些主要方面来评价“儒林外史”。这也就是为什么我们要隆重地纪念“儒林外史”作者吴敬梓的逝世二百周年。
    在茅盾致开会词后，中国作家协会古典文学部副部长何其芳作了“吴敬梓的小说‘儒林外史’”的报告。他根据“儒林外史”的内容，分析了吴敬梓所批判的封建社会中丑恶的事物，吴敬梓的身世及他不和黑暗、腐朽的封建社会妥协、不向贫苦低头的性格，他的尊重个性，认为靠劳动养活自己是高尚的思想。他说，讽刺是小说“儒林外史”的一个突出的特色，这部小说在艺术的表现上达到了古典作品中的很高的水平，我们今天还应该向这部名著好好学习。
    在何其芳报告以后，中央人民广播电台广播剧团的张凯、王扶林、蔡骧朗诵了“儒林外史”中的几个部分。
