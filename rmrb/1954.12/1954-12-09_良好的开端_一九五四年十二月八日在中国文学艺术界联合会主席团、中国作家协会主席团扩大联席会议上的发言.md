A Good Beginning
—Speech at the Enlarged Joint Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on December 8, 1954
Mao Dun

Our conference has been held eight times. Just now, Chairman Guo Moruo gave instructions on the goals and tasks of this discussion, and how to continue to carry out the struggle against bourgeois ideology and criticize Hu Shi, etc. Chairman Guo's instructions are very profound, very sincere, and full of the spirit of being benevolent and helpful, and at the same time, he warned us to prevent possible deviations. I fully support Chairman Guo's instructions. I think that all the friends present, old and young, must also fully support them. Chairman Guo also mentioned that Comrade Zhou Yang's speech was very comprehensive and had a summarizing significance, and I fully agree.

I have personally benefited a lot from this discussion. In the past five years, the Party Central Committee has repeatedly sounded the alarm for us: from the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" to the current criticism of the "Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber." The Party's urging and supervision are all for the sake of caring for us, educating us, and improving us.

In the past five days of the conference, comrades spoke enthusiastically and provided many valuable opinions, making a good start for launching an ideological struggle against bourgeois idealism and establishing a healthy atmosphere of free discussion.

In the future, we will continue to launch a comprehensive and in-depth criticism of Hu Shi's thought. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Writers Association held a joint meeting and decided on a discussion plan that will last for half a year—including group meetings and report meetings. This is absolutely necessary. Because, we have drawn a clear line with Hu Shi politically, but not necessarily ideologically or in academic research methods. There is a passage in Chairman Guo's speech just now that is very profound and worthy of repeated consideration and deep reflection. This passage is like this:

"I feel that many of us older people have problems with our brains. The cerebral cortex of our brains is like a world traveler's suitcase, completely covered with hotel labels from various docks. Such people can truly be said to be a complete mess, with little room for accepting new things..."

These words, for Chairman Guo, are words of self-deprecation; but for us, they cannot but be said to be a true portrayal. Taking myself as an example, in my youth, because I admired Zhuangzi, I yearned for the Wei and Jin dynasties, and because I yearned for the Wei and Jin dynasties, I loved parallel prose. A year or two before the May Fourth Movement, I was once attracted by anarchism—perhaps this has something to do with my earlier admiration for Zhuangzi? During the May Fourth Movement, I was influenced by "New Youth," and naturally I was also influenced by Hu Shi's literary thought. Until twenty years ago, although I had politically recognized the reactionary nature of Hu Shi, I was still ignorant of the reactionary nature of Hu Shi's bourgeois idealism in academic thought. Therefore, in 1935, when I was invited by Kaiming Bookstore to compile a so-called "clean version" of "Dream of the Red Chamber," I completely copied Hu Shi's fallacies in the so-called "Introduction" I wrote at the beginning. I do not deny that at that time, I was a prisoner of Hu Shi's thought; I especially dare not shamelessly say that today, there are no remnants of Hu Shi's thought in my mind! I dare not say that there is no bourgeois ideology. Just now, Chairman Guo Moruo compared it to: "The cerebral cortex of our brains is completely covered with hotel labels from various docks...with little room for accepting new things." Now I plan to extend his meaning and make another analogy. I feel that we have not learned Marxism-Leninism well, it's as if we have added some Marxist-Leninist slogans on the cerebral cortex that is covered with all kinds of hotel labels; on the surface, it looks a bit like Marxism-Leninism, but it cannot withstand scrutiny; once tested, those messy labels behind the slogans will pop out; if they come out from the gaps in those Marxist-Leninist slogans, then it is called showing one's true colors, which is relatively easy to discover; the most dangerous thing is to come out wearing the Marxist-Leninist slogan, which is called hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat, claiming to be a Marxist, enough to deceive the world and steal fame! I think: We must have the courage to reflect on ourselves, and from now on, we must honestly study hard, we must use Marxism-Leninism as a weapon of thought to clean up the poisonous hotel labels on our cerebral cortex, instead of adding Marxist-Leninist slogans on these hotel labels. We must get rid of that self-deceiving style. We must reflect on ourselves and study honestly, so that we will not fail the Party Central Committee's good intentions in sounding the alarm for us!

On the issue of widely展开ing free academic discussions, Chairman Guo pointed out that we should "promote constructive criticism;" and put forward sixteen characters: "Distinguish right from wrong, distinguish between enemies and friends, be kind to people, and speak meaningfully." On the issue of "stepping up the support of new forces," he pointed out that "cultivation includes the process of love, education, and training," "Do not allow love to deviate, we must be good at love." He also emphasized: "At our discussion meeting... some friends revealed such opinions in their speeches: as long as they criticize the youth, it is suppressing the new forces... This is incorrect. This is a one-sided understanding of the problem. There are also some bad elements among the youth. Although this is caused by the remnants of the old society, we cannot ignore it. If it is said that we must support the new forces, then even the bad youth or the bad tendencies of the youth cannot be corrected, that should be said to be a considerable mistake." We should deeply remember these words of Chairman Guo and regard them as a guide for action.

Chairman Guo also earnestly encouraged us: As long as the elderly "are willing to study hard, stand together with the new forces, earnestly arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism, correct our positions and viewpoints, improve our work enthusiasm, strengthen our combativeness, and improve our competitive spirit, even if the sensitivity to accept new things is a little slower, it will not prematurely sink into numbness." I hope that those of us who are older will regard these words as our motto.

Finally, regarding the mistakes made by the "Literary Gazette," comrades have said a lot, and very deeply and correctly, and I fully agree. Time is short, please forgive me for not repeating what the comrades have already said. Here, I just want to say that as the chairman of the Writers Association, I should bear a major responsibility for the mistakes made by the "Literary Gazette." In the past few years, ideologically, I have not regarded leading the "Literary Gazette" as part of my responsibility. I rarely read each issue of the "Literary Gazette" from beginning to end. When I was busy, I only flipped through the table of contents and put it aside; this attitude is unacceptable. It is an irresponsible attitude. The Presidium of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Writers Association have put forward a draft resolution on the "Literary Gazette," which has been distributed to everyone today, please discuss it and pass it at this conference.

Comrades, this discussion meeting is coming to an end. But although the discussion meeting is temporarily over, the struggle against bourgeois ideology, the criticism of Hu Shi's reactionary philosophical thought, political thought, historical views, literary thought, etc., is just about to unfold; let us all step into this serious ideological struggle in unison, and forge a "new self" in the struggle!

    良好的开端
    ——一九五四年十二月八日在中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团扩大联席会议上的发言
    茅盾
    我们这个大会已经开了八次，刚才郭沫若主席对于这次讨论会的目标和任务以及今后如何继续开展反对资产阶级思想，批判胡适等等，都有所指示。郭主席对于我们的指示，非常深刻，非常恳切，充满了勉励我们的与人为善的精神，而且同时也告诫我们防止可能发生的偏差。我完全拥护郭主席的指示，我想，所有到会的朋友们，年老的和年青的，一定也是完全拥护的。郭主席又说到周扬同志的发言，很全面，具有总结性的意义，我完全同意。
    这次讨论，我个人受益很多。五年来，党中央屡次为我们敲起了警钟：从电影“武训传”的批判，直到此次的“红楼梦研究”批评。党这样地鞭策、督促，都为的是关心我们，教育我们，提高我们。
    过去的五天大会，同志们发言踊跃，提供了不少宝贵意见，为展开对资产阶级唯心论的思想斗争，树立健全的自由讨论的风气，作了个良好的开端。
    今后，我们将继续展开对于胡适思想的全面而深入的批判。中国科学院和中国作家协会开过一次联席会议，决定了持续到半年之久的讨论方案——包括小组会和报告会。这样做，是完全必要的。因为，我们在政治上跟胡适划清了界线的，并不一定就在思想上，学术研究方法上也已经跟胡适划清了界线。刚才郭主席的发言里有一段话，非常深刻，值得我们反复体味，痛切反省。这一段话是这样的：
      “我感觉着我们许多上了年纪的人，脑子实在有问题。我们的大脑皮质，就像一个世界旅行家的手提箧一样，全面都巴满了各个码头上的旅馆商标。这样的人，那真可以说是一塌糊涂，很少有接受新鲜事物的余地了。……”
    这段话，在郭主席，是自己谦虚的话；但在我们，却不能不说是真实的写照。拿我自己来说，我在青年时代，由于崇拜庄子，就企慕魏晋，由于企慕魏晋，就爱好骈文，“五四”前一二年，我也曾一度为安那其主义所吸引，——这大概和我早些时的崇拜庄子有点关系罢？“五四”时，我受了
  “新青年”的影响，自然也受了胡适的文学思想的影响。直到距今二十年前，虽然在政治上我已经认清了胡适的反动的本质，但对于学术思想上胡适的资产阶级唯心论的反动的本质，我还是茫然无知的。因此，在一九三五年我应开明书店的邀约，编一本所谓“红楼梦”洁本的时候，我在前面写了所谓“导言”就完全抄引了胡适的谬论。我不讳言，那时候，我做了胡适思想的俘虏；我尤其不敢大言不惭地说，今天，我的思想中就完全没有胡适思想的残余了！不敢说就没有资产阶级思想了。刚才郭沫若主席比方说：“我们的大脑皮质，全面……都巴满了各个码头上的旅馆商标。……很少有接受新鲜事物的余地了”，现在我打算引申他的意思，再作一点比喻。我觉得，我们学习马克思列宁主义没有学得好，就好像是在贴满了各种各样的旅馆商标的大脑皮质上又加贴了马克思列宁主义的若干标语；表面上看看，有点马克思列宁主义，但经不起考验；一朝考验，标语后面的那些乱七八糟的商标就会冒出头来；如果是从那些马克思列宁主义的标语的隙缝里钻了出来，那就叫做露了马脚，那倒是比较容易发现的；最危险的，是顶着马克思列宁主义的标语而冒出来，那就叫做挂羊头卖狗肉，自命为马克思主义者，足以欺世盗名！我想：我们一定要有勇气来反躬自省，从今后，一定要老老实实好好学习，一定要用马克思列宁主义这个思想武器来肃清我们大脑皮质上那些有毒素的旅馆商标，而不是在这些旅馆商标上加贴了马克思列宁主义的标语。我们必须改掉那种自欺欺人的作风。我们要反躬自省，老实学习，这才不辜负党中央对我们敲起警钟的婆心苦口！
    在广泛地展开学术上的自由讨论这一问题上，郭主席指出，要“提倡建设性的批评”；并提出了十六字：“明辨是非，分清敌友，与人为善，言之有物”。在“加紧扶植新生力量”这问题上，他指出，“在培养之中包含着爱护、教育、锻炼的过程”，“不要使爱护发生偏差，我们要善于爱护”。他又着重地指出：“在我们的讨论会上，……有的朋友在发言中透露了这样的意见：只要对于青年批评，那就是压制新生力量。……这是不正确的，这是把问题作了片面的了解。青年当中也还有些坏的成分，这虽然是旧社会的遗毒使然，但我们不能够置之不管。假使说既要扶植新生力量，那就连不良的青年或青年的不良倾向也不能矫正了，那应该说是相当大的错误。”郭主席这些话，我们应当深切铭记，奉为行动的指针。
    郭主席又语重心长地鼓励我们：老年人只要“肯努力学习，同新生的力量站在一起，用马克思列宁主义来认真地武装自己，端正我们的立场观点，提高我们的工作热情，加强我们的战斗性，健全我们的好胜心，即使接受新鲜事物的敏感性要迟钝一些，但总不至于过早地陷没到麻木不仁的地步。”我愿我们上了年纪的人都把这几句话当作座右铭。
    最后，关于“文艺报”所犯的错误，同志们已经说得很多，而且很深刻，很正确，我完全同意。时间不多，恕我不再重复同志们已经说过的话，在这里，我只想说，文艺报所犯的错误，作为作家协会主席的我，应当负重大的责任。这几年来，我在思想上，就没有把领导“文艺报”看作是我的责任的一部分，我很少把每期的“文艺报”从头看到底，遇到事情忙的时候竟只翻了翻目录就搁在一边；这种态度是要不得的。就是不负责的态度。文联主席团和作家协会主席团提出一个关于“文艺报”的决议草案，今天已发给大家，请予讨论，在这大会上通过。
    同志们，这次的讨论会要告结束了。但讨论会虽然暂时结束，反对资产阶级思想的斗争，批判胡适的反动的哲学思想、政治思想、历史观点、文学思想等等，却正待展开；让我们大家步伐一致地走进这场严重的思想斗争，并且在斗争中锻炼出“新我”来！
