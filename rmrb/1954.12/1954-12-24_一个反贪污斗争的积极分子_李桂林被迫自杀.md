    An Anti-Corruption Activist – Li Guilin, Driven to Suicide
    Jia Yujiang
    Li Guilin, a cook in the canteen of the Yangquan City Industrial Production Cooperative Union in Shanxi Province, committed suicide on September 22nd because he was not supported in his active struggle against corrupt elements, but instead was attacked and framed. The bad elements directly responsible for this tragic event have not been punished for a long time, and the bureaucrats who shielded these bad elements have not received the punishment they deserve.
    Li Guilin was a 56-year-old cook who had always been active and responsible in his work. However, Wang Tianbao, who was in charge of canteen management, was a bad element who had been sentenced to eight months in prison for corruption during the "Three-Anti" campaign. After Wang Tianbao returned to work, he did not change his bad habits and often ate without paying. When Li Guilin discovered this, he raised objections and stopped his corrupt behavior. Wang Tianbao also attempted to embezzle public funds by underreporting the amount of food used in the accounts, but this was also exposed by Li Guilin. For example, twelve dishes were cooked with one jin of pork, but Wang Tianbao only recorded eight dishes in the accounts, attempting to embezzle the money for four dishes. Li Guilin raised these issues with Wang Tianbao several times in person, but was met with retaliation. Therefore, Li Guilin kept his own set of accounts and frequently compared his accounts with Wang Tianbao's. In Wang Tianbao's eyes, Li Guilin became a thorn in his side. To remove this thorn, Wang Tianbao did everything possible to attack, frame, and humiliate Li Guilin. Li Guilin asked Wang Tianbao every day what food to cook and how many people to cook for, but Wang always delayed in telling him, and then scolded Li Guilin for cooking too slowly when it was time to eat. Once, after Li Guilin had cooked the dishes, someone secretly put a lot of salt chunks into the dishes. Wang Tianbao used the excuse that the dishes were too salty to eat and severely reprimanded Li Guilin.
    There was a person in the canteen who was specifically in charge of the tea stove, named Wang Liang. In order to please Wang Tianbao, he often deliberately made things difficult for Li Guilin in his work, even secretly taking away a tool that Li Guilin needed when he was cooking. When Li Guilin was sleeping, Wang Liang sprayed "DDT" into Li Guilin's mouth. Li Guilin questioned him, but Wang Liang said shamelessly, "You are too smelly, I am disinfecting you!" Wang Liang also stole public property, which was discovered and criticized by Li Guilin, and he became even more resentful of Li Guilin.
    Li Guilin felt that the problems in the canteen were serious, so he actively reported them to Zhao Peizhong (a Party branch member), the secretary's office cadre in charge of canteen work. However, Zhao Peizhong's attitude was exactly the same as Wang Tianbao's. It turned out that Wang Tianbao and Zhao Peizhong had a close relationship, and Wang Tianbao often spoke ill of Li Guilin in front of Zhao Peizhong. When Li Guilin was ill, the canteen hired a bankrupt landlord as a temporary cook. This person, in order to be able to work here for a long time, constantly flattered Zhao Peizhong. When he learned that Zhao Peizhong's wife was ill and needed dog oil for treatment, he tried every means to get it. Zhao Peizhong felt that this person was beneficial to him, so he prepared to make him a permanent worker. However, at this time, Li Guilin recovered and returned to work. Therefore, Zhao Peizhong deliberately suppressed the problems reported by Li Guilin, did not report them to his superiors, and colluded with Wang Tianbao to find fault with Li Guilin's work, attempting to create an excuse to fire him. At the same time, he told the bankrupt landlord to stay in Yangquan and wait to replace Li Guilin.
    Unable to resolve the problem, Li Guilin reported directly to the leaders of the cooperative. However, Guo Hansan (Party branch secretary), the deputy director in charge of production, although he knew that there were problems in the canteen and had promised to resolve them, kept dragging his feet. Kong Qingshou (Party branch deputy secretary), the deputy director in charge of political and ideological work, also convened a meeting for this matter, but he believed that it was just a dispute between the cook and the manager, not a big deal. Therefore, he did not carefully listen to Li Guilin's opinions, and simply said at the meeting: "Now is the transition period, everyone should express their attitude, are you willing to take the capitalist road? Or are you willing to take the socialist road?" When Li Guilin expressed his willingness to take the socialist road, the deputy director hastily said: "Since this is the case, everyone should unite and work hard."
    The problem was dragged on like this. Wang Tianbao, Zhao Peizhong, and Wang Liang became increasingly severe in their attacks, framing, and humiliation of Li Guilin. Unable to bear it any longer, Li Guilin wrote a letter to the directors on September 12th, demanding a swift resolution. Deputy Director Kong Qingshou, after reading the letter, believed it was a matter for the cadre section and handed it over to the cadre section for processing. However, the head of the cadre section, Zhen Keming, had already listened to Zhao Peizhong and believed that Li Guilin's work performance was poor and he should be fired. Therefore, he ignored the letter. Seeing that no one was taking care of the problem, Li Guilin wrote a second letter on the 17th, but the fate of this letter was the same as the first, locked in Zhen Keming's drawer. To urge the directors to resolve this problem quickly, Li Guilin wrote another letter on the 19th and handed over his account books to Deputy Director Kong Qingshou. Kong Qingshou felt that the two letters transferred to the cadre section had not been processed, knowing that transferring this letter would be in vain, so he locked it in his own drawer.
    Seeing that no one in the organization was solving the problem, Li Guilin went to the Yangquan Municipal Party Committee Rural Work Department on the 21st to appeal. The comrades of the Municipal Party Committee Rural Work Department comforted him and told him that the Municipal Party Committee would send someone to help solve the problem immediately. The next day, before the people sent by the Municipal Party Committee had arrived, Li Guilin came again and said: "If the problem cannot be solved quickly, I cannot live." Seeing that the problem was serious, the comrades of the Rural Work Department comforted him again and sent someone to accompany him back. At this time, Li Guilin was very happy because he saw that the problem was coming to an end.
    That afternoon, Comrade Zhang Chaoyang of the Municipal Party Committee Rural Work Department told Deputy Director Kong Qingshou and Cadre Section Chief Zhen Keming about the seriousness of the problem and said: "Before the problem is solved, pay close attention to avoid accidents." However, Section Chief Zhen Keming said: "We have long been prepared to fire this person." Even so, due to the instructions of the Rural Work Department, they had to pay attention. Therefore, Zhen Keming told Zhao Peizhong and Wang Tianbao: "You have to keep an eye on Li Guilin, be careful he dies." Li Guilin committed suicide while Zhao Peizhong and Wang Tianbao were watching him. Before his death, Li Guilin had gone to his relatives' house and said: "My problem has become big, they have put a big hat on me." His relatives said: "Can they put a counter-revolutionary hat on you?" Li said: "What hat dare they not put on?" It is worth pointing out here that: Li Guilin was originally happy when he heard that the Municipal Party Committee was going to help solve the problem, but why did he commit suicide two or three hours later? What pressure did Zhao Peizhong and Wang Tianbao put on Li Guilin in the meantime?
    After Li Guilin's suicide, Zhen Keming, in order to cover up the truth, rushed to the Municipal Party Committee Rural Work Department and said: "According to the Public Security Bureau, Li Guilin is a counter-revolutionary element, and he may have committed suicide for fear of punishment." (In fact, the Public Security Bureau had never said this to him.) The Industrial Production Cooperative Union also held an emergency meeting, but did not investigate the cause of Li Guilin's suicide. On the contrary, Zhen Keming, using the fine name of "stabilizing people's hearts," said at the meeting: "Li Guilin's death was worthless, he betrayed the Party, betrayed the country, and betrayed the people." Deputy Director Kong Qingshou was present at the time, but remained silent.
    When this incident first occurred, it did attract the attention of the Yangquan City Procuratorate and People's Court and other units, so they immediately organized a working group to conduct an investigation. However, after the investigation, the momentum slowed down. The Procuratorate believed that this was only a bureaucratic event and did not prosecute the People's Court. Although Li Guilin's family repeatedly went to the People's Court to request handling, the court delayed the matter on the grounds that the Procuratorate had not prosecuted and the investigation materials were not specific. It was not until November 11th that the Shanxi Daily criticized this matter, pointing out that the case of Li Guilin being forced to commit suicide should be handled quickly. The People's Procuratorate, People's Court, and other relevant units then attached importance to it again and began to handle the case, and successively arrested Wang Tianbao and Zhao Peizhong on November 21st and 24th. The leaders of the Production Cooperative Union have also ordered Cadre Section Chief Zhen Keming to suspend his duties and reflect.

    一个反贪污斗争的积极分子——李桂林被迫自杀
    贾玉江
    山西省阳泉市工业生产合作社联合社的食堂炊事员李桂林，因积极向贪污分子进行斗争得不到支持，反而被打击陷害，在九月二十二日自杀了。直接造成这一惨痛事件的坏分子却长期没有受到制裁，庇护坏分子作恶的官僚主义分子也没有受到应得的处分。
    李桂林是一个五十六岁的老炊事员，工作一贯积极负责。但负责食堂管理的王天保则是一个坏分子，曾因贪污罪行，在“三反”时被判处八个月徒刑。但王天保重新参加工作后，仍恶习不改，吃饭经常不拿钱。李桂林发现以后，就提出意见阻止了他这种贪污行为。王天保还企图在记账时用以少记多的办法贪污公款，也被李桂林揭穿了。比如一斤生猪肉炒了十二个菜，但王天保在记账时，却只记八个，企图贪污四个菜的钱。李桂林当面给王天保提了几次意见，都遭到王天保的报复。因此李桂林自己也记了一本账，经常拿自己的账单和王天保的账簿查对。这样在王天保眼里，李桂林就变成了一颗钉子。为了拔除这颗钉子，王天保千方百计地对李桂林实行打击、陷害和侮辱。李桂林每天问王天保做什么饭，做多少人的饭，而王总是迟迟不说，到吃饭时又斥责李桂林做饭慢了。有一次李桂林把菜炒好，菜里发现有人临时放进了很多的盐块。王天保就借口菜太咸不能吃，把李桂林狠狠地训斥了一顿。
    食堂里有一个专门看茶炉的人，名字叫王良。他为了讨好王天保，也常常在工作上故意和李桂林为难，甚至在李桂林做饭正需用一种工具时，他却偷偷地拿走了。在李桂林睡觉时，王良曾经往李桂林嘴里喷射“滴滴涕”。李桂林曾提出质问，但王良却无耻地说：“你太臭了，给你消消毒吧！”王良也曾经偷窃公家的东西，被李桂林发现，批评了他，他就越发怀恨李桂林。
    李桂林觉着食堂里的问题严重，就积极地向领导食堂工作的秘书室干事赵培中（党支部委员）反映，谁知道赵培中的态度却和王天保的完全一样。原来王天保和赵培中关系密切，王天保经常在赵培中面前说李桂林的坏话。在李桂林有病的时候，食堂里曾雇了一个破落地主做临时炊事员，这个人为了能在这里长期工作，就时时奉承赵培中，当他知道赵培中的爱人有病，需要用狗油治疗时，便多方设法把狗油弄来。赵培中觉得这个人对自己有好处，就准备把他改为长期工，但这时李桂林也病好回来了。因此赵培中故意把李桂林反映的问题压着，不向上汇报，并和王天保连成一气，寻找李桂林工作中的缺点，企图制造借口把李桂林开除。同时他又告诉那个破落地主在阳泉住下，等着接替李桂林。
    问题不能解决，李桂林就直接向社的领导上反映，但负责生产工作的副主任郭汉三（党支部书记）虽然知道食堂有问题，也曾经答应要解决，但一直拖着不过问。负责政治思想工作的副主任孔庆寿（党支部副书记）也曾经为这事召开过会议，但他认为只是炊事员和管理员之间闹意见，不是大事情，因此没有仔细地听取李桂林的意见，只简单地在会上说：“现在是过渡时期，大家应该表示态度，愿意走资本主义道路？还是愿意走社会主义道路？”当李桂林表示愿意走社会主义道路时，这位副主任便草草地说：“既然这样，大家就应该团结起来努力工作”。
    问题就这样拖下来。王天保、赵培中和王良对李桂林的打击、陷害、侮辱越来越厉害了。李桂林忍无可忍，就在九月十二日给主任们写信，要求迅速处理。副主任孔庆寿看了这封信，认为是干部科的事，便交给干部科处理。那知干部科长甄克明早已听信了赵培中的话，认为李桂林工作表现不好，应该开除，因此就没有理会这封信。李桂林看着问题还是没有人管，又在十七日写了第二封信，而这封信的命运，仍和第一封信一样，被锁在甄克明的抽屉里。为了督促主任们迅速解决这个问题，李桂林在十九日又写了一封信，并把自己记的账单交给副主任孔庆寿。孔庆寿觉着转给干部科两封信都没处理，知道这封信转去也是枉然，因此便锁在自己的抽屉里了。
    李桂林看着在机关里没人给解决问题，便在二十一日到阳泉市委农村工作部去申诉。市委农村工作部同志对他进行了安慰，并告诉他市委马上派人去帮助解决。第二天，市委会派的人还没有下去，李桂林又找上来了，并说：“问题如不能很快解决，我就不能活了。”农村工作部的同志看着问题严重，又对他进行了安慰，并派人陪他一块回去。这时候李桂林看问题到头了，心里很高兴。
    当天下午，市委农村工作部张朝阳同志把问题的严重性告诉生产社的副主任孔庆寿和干部科长甄克明，并说：“在问题没有解决以前，要十分注意，以免发生意外事件。”但甄克明科长却说：“这个人我们早就准备开除了。”虽然这样，但由于农村工作部的指示，他们也不得不注意。因此甄克明就告诉赵培中、王天保说：“你们要看住李桂林，小心他死了。”就在赵培中、王天保看着的时候，李桂林自杀死了。李桂林在死前曾到他亲戚家说：“我的问题闹大了，人家给我戴上大帽子了。”他的亲戚说：“还能给你戴上反革命帽子？”李说：“人家什么帽子不敢给戴？”这里值得指出的是：李桂林听说市委要帮助解决问题时，心情本来是愉快的，但为什么在两三小时之后又自杀呢？这中间赵培中、王天保是不是给过李桂林什么压力呢？
    李桂林自杀以后，甄克明为了掩饰真象，就急急忙忙跑到市委农村工作部说：“听公安局说，李桂林是个反革命分子，他可能是畏罪自杀。”（其实公安局从来也没有同他这样说过）工业生产合作社联合社也召开了紧急会议，但并没有追查李桂林自杀的原因，相反的，甄克明还用“安定人心”的美名在会上说：“李桂林死得没价值、他叛党、叛国、叛人民。”副主任孔庆寿当时虽在场，但却默不作声。
    这一事件刚发生时，确曾引起了阳泉市检察机关和人民法院等单位的重视，因此立即组织了工作组进行调查，但调查之后，劲头却松下来了。检察机关认为这只是官僚主义事件，没有向人民法院起诉。李桂林家属虽再三到人民法院要求处理，但法院却以检察机关没有起诉和调查材料不具体为理由，把事情拖了下来。直到十一月十一日山西日报对这件事提出批评，指出李桂林被迫自杀身死的案件应迅速处理，人民检察院、人民法院等有关单位才又重视起来，着手处理这一案件，并在十一月二十一日和二十四日先后逮捕了王天保和赵培中。生产合作社联合社领导上也已令干部科长甄克明停职反省。
