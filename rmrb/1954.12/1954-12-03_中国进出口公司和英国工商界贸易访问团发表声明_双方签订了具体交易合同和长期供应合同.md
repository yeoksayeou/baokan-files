Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: Joint Statement by China National Import and Export Corporation and British Industrial and Commercial Trade Mission.

The British Industrial and Commercial Trade Mission, organized by the Sino-British Trade Council of the United Kingdom, began discussions with China National Import and Export Corporation, China's various export corporations, and the Bank of China in Beijing on November 22, 1954. The negotiations were conducted in a friendly and sincere atmosphere.

The visit of the British Industrial and Commercial Trade Mission to China was arranged after the Chinese trade mission visited the United Kingdom in June this year and consulted with the Sino-British Trade Council of the United Kingdom. The main purpose of the mission's visit to China was to discuss further development of trade between the two sides, as well as to negotiate specific transactions.

During the nearly two weeks, the mission signed a number of specific transaction contracts with China National Import and Export Corporation and China's various export corporations. In order to ensure long-term supply, the two sides signed long-term supply contracts for certain commodities. Both sides conducted extensive discussions on each other's needs and supply situation, creating favorable conditions for future trade development.

The two sides also further discussed a number of general issues related to the development of trade and achieved satisfactory results. The two sides also made preliminary arrangements for the Sino-British Trade Council to organize another British industrial and commercial visit to Beijing in March 1955.

Both sides agreed that this visit was fruitful and helpful to the development of Sino-British trade. Through this visit and discussions, both sides realized that there are many commodities that can be exchanged between China and the United Kingdom, and that the development of Sino-British trade has broad prospects, especially when normal trade is fully restored.
