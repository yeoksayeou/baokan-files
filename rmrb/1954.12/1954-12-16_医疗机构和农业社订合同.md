The Health Experiment Institute of Tongxian County, Hebei Province, organized health station treatment groups from six districts and twenty-one clinics, and signed medical and health care contracts with seventy agricultural production cooperatives. According to the stipulations in the contracts, full-time doctors were assigned to visit the agricultural production cooperatives in a timely manner to diagnose illnesses or conduct physical examinations for the members. During the busy summer farming season and seasons with higher incidence of diseases, the full-time doctors were required to visit the cooperatives frequently for medical consultations. To alleviate the burden on members who had difficulty paying medical fees in a lump sum, many clinics adopted a bookkeeping method, with the cooperative paying on their behalf in installments and the members settling the accounts in one go during the autumn profit distribution. At the same time, the clinics and treatment groups frequently conducted health education for the members through general meetings of members, meetings of member representatives, or by utilizing blackboards, rooftop broadcasts, and field meetings, and assisted members in environmental sanitation work. With the help of the treatment groups and clinics, most agricultural production cooperatives in the county established health rooms, and the personal and public hygiene of the members has greatly improved.

    医疗机构和农业社订合同
    河北省通县卫生实验院组织了六个区的卫生所治疗组，二十一个诊疗所，和七十个农业生产合作社订立了医疗保健合同。按照合同中的规定，确定了专职医生，及时地到农业生产合作社中去诊病或给社员检查身体。在夏季农忙和疾病较多的季节，专职医生更要经常到社里诊病。为了照顾社员一次付清医疗费的困难，许多诊疗所采取了记账办法，由合作社分期代付，秋季分红时由社员一次结清。同时，各诊疗所和诊疗组还经常通过社员大会、社员代表会，或利用黑板报、屋顶广播、地头会等，向社员进行卫生教育，并协助社员进行环境卫生工作。全县大部农业生产合作社在各治疗组和诊疗所帮助下，建立了卫生室，社员们的个人和公共卫生有很大的改进。
