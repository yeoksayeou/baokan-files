Situ Meitang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, published an article denouncing the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The article stated that the full text of the US-Chiang treaty, consisting of ten articles, boils down to just four words: war and betrayal.

The article then pointed out: The US government dreams of war. The London Nine-Power Conference and the Paris Treaty are its war deployments in Europe, aiming to arm West Germany and make Europeans fight Europeans. The "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" and the current US-Chiang treaty are its war deployments in Asia, buying off a group of desperate traitors and political zombies to make trouble, making Asians fight Asians. The US-Chiang treaty is not only a blatant occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands by the United States, seriously threatening China's security and infringing upon China's territorial sovereignty and integrity, but also a confession of the United States' barbaric destruction of peace in Asia and the world.

Chiang Kai-shek is a heinous and notorious old-brand traitor. For more than twenty years, he has been selling out the country every year, signing countless traitorous treaties with imperialism. He is willing to act as an accomplice, selling out the country for personal gain. The so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" between the US and Chiang is the most shameless act of treason. This is an open and blatant sell-out; he has sold out the people of Taiwan and sold out China's territory. Historically, traitors have never had a good ending. The Chiang Kai-shek clique has become an isolated band of bandits, despised by the world. This heinous public enemy of the Chinese people actually attempts to beg for salvation from this traitorous document to save his dying fate. This cannot but arouse the extreme anger of all the people of our country (including our compatriots in Taiwan). We Chinese people have smashed various traitorous treaties signed by the Chiang gang. Today, we must also smash the US-Chiang treaty. The article concludes: The days when imperialism meddled in Chinese affairs are long over. This is the new era of the Chinese people.

### 司徒美堂写文章斥责美蒋条约

    司徒美堂写文章斥责美蒋条约
    北京归国华侨联谊会副主席司徒美堂发表文章，斥责美蒋“共同防御条约”。文章说，美蒋条约全文十条，含义只是四个字：战争、卖国。
    文章接着指出：美国政府是梦想战争的。伦敦九国会议和巴黎条约，是它在欧洲的战争部署，想武装西德，使欧洲人打欧洲人。“东南亚集体防务条约”和现在的美蒋条约，是它在亚洲的战争部署，收买一群亡命的卖国贼和政治僵尸们捣乱，使亚洲人打亚洲人。美蒋条约不特是美国对中国领土台湾、澎湖列岛的明目张胆的侵占，严重地威胁中国的安全和侵犯中国领土主权完整的证件，而且是美国野蛮地破坏亚洲及世界和平事业的招供。
    蒋介石是个罪大恶极、臭名远扬的老牌卖国贼，二十多年来，年年都在卖国，向帝国主义不知订立了多少卖国条约，他甘心为虎作伥，卖国求荣。美蒋的所谓“共同防御条约”是其中最无耻的一次卖国条约。这是一次公开的大出卖，他出卖了台湾人民，出卖了中国领土。历史上，卖国贼总是没有好结局的，蒋介石卖国集团今天已成为孤岛流寇，受世人唾骂；这个万恶的中国人民的公敌，竟公然妄图乞灵于这张卖国文契，挽救他垂死的命运。这是不能不引起我们全国人民（包括台湾同胞）的极度愤怒的。我们中国人民曾经粉碎了蒋贼手订的各种卖国条约，今天对美蒋条约，也一定要予以粉碎。文章最后说：帝国主义过问中国事务的日子早已结束了，这是中国人民的新时代。
