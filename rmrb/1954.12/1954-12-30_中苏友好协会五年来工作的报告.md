Report on the Work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Over the Past Five Years
Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association

Chairman, fellow delegates, honored guests:

The Secretariat of the National Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has entrusted me to deliver a report on the work of the Association over the past five years to this Second Representative Conference. I request that the Conference examine it.

We recall that when the inaugural meeting of the National Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was held on October 5, 1949, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, the President of the Association, clearly pointed out in his report that due to the founding of the People's Republic of China, "Chinese history has since entered a completely new era, which has also brought the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples into a completely new era. Now, there is no force in the world that can stop or undermine the friendship and cooperation between our two peoples. The friendship and cooperation between our two peoples can thus be developed and consolidated limitlessly." The development of the situation over the past five years has fully confirmed the correctness of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's assessment.

As everyone remembers, it was our greatest friend, the Soviet Union, which recognized the new China on the second day after the founding of our People's Republic of China and established diplomatic relations with our country. Subsequently, on February 14, 1950, under the personal guidance of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong, China and the Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. This treaty formalized the great and eternal friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union in the form of a treaty. Due to the signing of this treaty, our People's Republic of China has the greatest ally and receives the strongest and most effective friendly support from it. The powerful alliance between China and the Soviet Union has since emerged on the international stage as the most reliable bulwark for safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.

Over the past five years, the Soviet Union has provided comprehensive, systematic, and selfless assistance to China's economic construction. When the Chinese people faced the arduous task of economic recovery, the Soviet Union provided China with a long-term, low-interest loan of 300 million US dollars. This loan, along with the ever-increasing trade relations between the two countries, enabled us to obtain the equipment needed for recovery and construction. The Soviet government also acceded to the request of the Chinese government and sent a large number of experts with extensive knowledge and experience to help our various construction endeavors. Thanks to the outstanding and selfless work of the Soviet experts, they helped us overcome the difficulties of lacking experience and technology and created favorable conditions for training construction cadres in our country. Since 1953, China has started the construction of its first Five-Year Plan. The Soviet government has provided strong support for China's first Five-Year Plan. After consultations between the two governments, the Soviet Union agreed to provide us with systematic economic and technical assistance in the construction and renovation of 141 large-scale projects in China. These projects include iron and steel complexes, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal mines, oil refineries, machine manufacturing plants, automobile manufacturing plants, tractor manufacturing plants, aircraft manufacturing plants, power stations, chemical factories, etc., which constitute the backbone of China's first Five-Year Plan. In addition, the Soviet Union has also provided tremendous assistance to China in other areas.

Over the past five years, China and the Soviet Union have supported and cooperated with each other in international affairs and have achieved great victories in thwarting the imperialists' war plans, easing international tensions, and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. As everyone knows, since the Second World War, American imperialism has inherited the mantle of German and Japanese fascism, attempting to enslave and dominate the world and preparing to launch a new world war. In June 1950, less than a year after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the United States flagrantly launched the war of aggression against Korea, and at the same time announced its occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and intensified its interference in the war in Indochina. The aggression of American imperialism created an extremely serious situation in the Far East and even the whole world. However, due to the unwavering struggle for peace by China and the Soviet Union, and due to the heroic fighting of the Korean and Chinese people's armies, American imperialism suffered a disgraceful defeat in Korea and was finally forced to accept the armistice in July 1953. Subsequently, at the Geneva Conference held this year, due to the policy of upholding peace and international cooperation adhered to by the Soviet Union, China, and Vietnam, which defeated the unreasonable obstruction and sabotage of the United States, an agreement was also reached on the restoration of peace in Indochina.

The USSR has consistently fought for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United nations. This just position of the Soviet Union has been universally supported by the people of the world. The unreasonable obstruction of the American aggressor clique and its followers has become increasingly isolated.

The talks between the governments of China and the Soviet Union held this October marked a milestone in the new development of Sino-Soviet friendship and cooperation. In the joint declaration issued by the two governments after the talks, it was reaffirmed that the two countries would take consistent actions to safeguard their security and maintain peace in the Far East and the world. The two countries jointly condemned the United States' unreasonable obstruction of the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations, condemned the United States' direct acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China, especially its continued occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and its military and financial assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and resolutely condemned the establishment of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, an aggressive military bloc. On relations with Japan, the two governments jointly stated that Japan should obtain complete national independence, establish its own democratic system, and develop its own independent peaceful economy and national culture, and expressed their willingness to take steps to normalize their relations with Japan. In addition, the two governments agreed, in accordance with the new situation, that Soviet troops would withdraw from the joint Sino-Soviet naval base at Lushunkou. The two governments also agreed to transfer the Soviet shares in the joint Sino-Soviet enterprises to China. During and after the talks, it was also agreed that the Soviet government would further expand its assistance to China's construction and help China organize large-scale state-owned grain farms.

From what has been said above, it can be seen that the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union has developed unprecedentedly in the past five years. There is no doubt that this eternal and unbreakable friendship will continue to develop and consolidate in the future. The existence and development of this friendship not only has a tremendous impact on the success of China's socialist construction, but also has a tremendous impact on the development of the entire world situation. Facts have proved that precisely because of the existence and development of the powerful Sino-Soviet alliance, because of the continuous growth of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and because of the growth of peace forces throughout the world, the American aggressor clique has been severely hit and frustrated time and again in both the East and the West.

Five years ago, at the founding of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, President Liu Shaoqi clearly pointed out that the purpose of organizing the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was "to enhance and consolidate the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and to promote the exchange of all wisdom and experience between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union." Over the past five years, we have carried out our work in accordance with this instruction of President Liu Shaoqi and in accordance with the purpose of the Association stipulated in the Articles of Association.

First, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has strived to enhance and consolidate the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. From the day it was established, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association began to carry out internationalist propaganda and education on the development and consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship among the broad masses. In the early days of the Association, we, in conjunction with various parties, launched a large-scale Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda campaign through activities such as welcoming the Soviet cultural, scientific, and artistic workers' delegation headed by Fadeyev and Simonov, celebrating the 32nd anniversary of the October Revolution, celebrating Comrade Stalin's 70th birthday, and especially celebrating the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. These activities played an important role in eliminating the residual poison of anti-Soviet propaganda by domestic and foreign enemies. During the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association widely disseminated propaganda on the comparison of the strength of the two major camps in the world, enhanced the people's confidence in victory, and increased the masses' trust and love for the Soviet Union. It should be especially pointed out that the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" held in October 1952 was the largest nationwide pro-Soviet friendship movement in Chinese history. Through this movement, Sino-Soviet friendship basically reached the point where it was known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.

The mutual dispatch of delegations between China and the Soviet Union is an effective way to enhance friendship. Over the past five years, there have been frequent exchanges of delegations between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. Among them, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association invited and received seven Soviet delegations, and the Association organized four delegations to visit the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet side. In addition, more delegations and visiting groups were organized by both China and the Soviet Union. The activities of these delegations and visiting groups played a great role in enhancing the friendship and mutual understanding between China and the Soviet Union.

Second, promote the study of the Soviet Union. Since its establishment, the Association has introduced the achievements of the Soviet people in building communism and their experience in building socialism through various means, such as organizing lectures and reports, publishing books and periodicals, propaganda materials, holding photo exhibitions, showing films, and running amateur Russian schools and Russian libraries. According to incomplete statistics, as of August this year, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association organized more than 196,000 lectures and reports, with more than 43 million listeners; published more than 1,000 kinds of propaganda materials, with more than 20 million copies printed and distributed; held more than 118,000 photo exhibitions, with more than 123 million viewers; and ran more than 400 Russian night schools, with more than 23,000 students. These efforts have greatly increased the masses' understanding of the Soviet Union, thereby inspiring the enthusiasm to learn from the Soviet Union and build socialism. We also invited famous Soviet scholars such as Academician Yudin, Academician Ostrovitianov, Academician Petrovsky, and Academician Pankratova, and organized Soviet experts working in China to give reports, lectures, and hold discussions in various parts of China. It should be especially pointed out that a large-scale exhibition of the achievements of Soviet economic and cultural construction has been held in Beijing since October this year, and in less than three months, nearly three million people have visited it. These have provided great help to China's economic and cultural construction.

Many local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations have directly participated in activities to promote Soviet advanced experience, such as organizing factories and mines to hold seminars and exhibitions on learning from Soviet advanced experience, and organizing the scientific and technological community and the medical community to hold seminars on learning from Soviet science, which has achieved considerable results.

In the propaganda of the general task of the country during the transition period, local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations have made vigorous cooperation, using the example of Soviet construction of socialism to point out to the broad masses that the road the Soviet people have taken is the road we are going to take today, explaining that the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow.

Third, introduce the lives and construction achievements of the new Chinese people to the Soviet people. The great Soviet people, as the most loyal friends of the Chinese people, urgently demand to understand the various construction projects and the actual lives of the people in the new China. They are excited and proud of every victory of the Chinese people in building their new lives. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has regularly sent various cultural materials to the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and other Soviet organizations or individuals, such as books, periodicals, reproductions of art works, photographs, films, and music recording tapes published in China. We have also often organized exhibitions in conjunction with relevant units to exhibit in the Soviet Union, among which the larger ones include the Exhibition of Literature and Art of the People's Republic of China and the Exhibition of Arts and Crafts of the People's Republic of China, especially the grand Exhibition of Industry and Agriculture of the People's Republic of China held in Moscow in 1953, which was warmly welcomed by the Soviet people. This year, a delegation to the Soviet Union sent by the Association made many reports in major cities of the Soviet Union introducing the construction of various aspects of the new China. These efforts have been very helpful in increasing the Soviet people's understanding of the new China.

Over the past five years, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has cooperated with the country's construction and the struggle of the Chinese and Soviet peoples to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, and has done some work and achieved certain results. These achievements have been made under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, with the strong support and assistance of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and with the efforts of all members, as well as with the enthusiastic help of Soviet friends, especially the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. However, there are still many shortcomings in our work, such as that the work is not deep enough, the contact and cooperation with various aspects are not close enough, and the social forces and the propaganda forces of various aspects have not been fully utilized. We must resolutely overcome these shortcomings in our future work.

At present, the people of our country are carrying out a great socialist construction. This construction will enable us to get rid of exploitation and poverty forever, and make our motherland a prosperous and happy socialist country. The tasks before us are very arduous, and learning from the Soviet Union and getting Soviet assistance are important conditions for our country to successfully carry out socialist construction. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union and learn from the Soviet Union more conscientiously. This is one aspect. On the other hand, although the cause of peace has achieved continuous victories due to the united struggle of China and the Soviet Union and the united struggle of peace-loving people all over the world, the American aggressor clique will never automatically give up its aggressive ambitions and plots to provoke war because of this. On the contrary, they are becoming more and more frantic in implementing the policy of arms expansion and war preparation and creating international tension because of their failures. In Europe, after the notorious "European Defense Community" plan was smashed by the European people, the United States and its followers hurriedly signed the "Paris Agreement," the purpose of which is still to rearm West Germany and create a new war. In the East, the United States not only tried every possible means to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, but also brazenly organized the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, plotting to undermine the peace agreement in Indochina. Recently, it signed the US-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, determined to be enemies with the people of our country. Therefore, the forces of peace and democracy all over the world must make long-term and arduous efforts, especially the people of China and the Soviet Union must unite more closely to safeguard world peace and stop the threat of a new war.

According to such a situation and the general task of our country, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should, on the basis of the original work, further develop and consolidate the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, continue to increase the cultural, economic and other ties and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, better introduce and promote the study of the Soviet Union's advanced experience and scientific and technological achievements, and further strengthen the close unity between China and the Soviet Union in the common struggle for lasting world peace. To this end, we should focus on doing the following tasks:

First, continue to work hard to enhance and consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship. In recent years, the brilliant achievements of friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples and the propaganda and education of Sino-Soviet friendship have greatly improved the internationalist understanding of the people of our country, and Sino-Soviet friendship has become the firm will of all the Chinese people. However, we cannot say that all ideas that are harmful to Sino-Soviet friendship have been completely eliminated. Among the people of our country, there are still some people who hold a skeptical attitude towards Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation, and others have wrong ideas such as simply relying on or even taking advantage of it. What cannot be ignored even more is that in the current situation, domestic and foreign enemies are painstakingly creating anti-Soviet slanders and provoking Sino-Soviet relations. Therefore, we must, in conjunction with the current situation and tasks, and in light of the ideological situation of the masses, conduct more widespread and in-depth internationalist education on Sino-Soviet friendship among the broad masses of the people, and further enhance and consolidate the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union. We must repeatedly use vivid and concrete examples to publicize that Sino-Soviet friendship is the highest interest of our two peoples, and fundamentally explain the basic principles of Sino-Soviet friendship. At the same time, we must promptly expose the anti-Soviet rumors of domestic and foreign enemies and point out the reactionary essence of these rumors. In this regard, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should cooperate more closely with all parties, better play the role of various propaganda weapons, and improve the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship newspaper and other propaganda materials, in order to expand the effect of propaganda and ensure that Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation has a more solid ideological foundation.

Second, strengthen the movement to study the Soviet Union. When our country began the construction of the first Five-Year Plan, Chairman Mao called on us in his speech at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, "We must sincerely learn from the Soviet Union. We must not only study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also learn from the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must launch a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country to build our country." With the expansion of the scale of national construction and the deepening of work, our task of learning from the Soviet Union is becoming more and more urgent and arduous. In the future, we must better respond to Chairman Mao's call, conscientiously study the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), and learn from the Soviet Union's various advanced experiences and scientific and technological knowledge. We should especially pay attention to learning from the Soviet experts working in our country, who are good teachers close to us. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should do more and better organizational work and provide more information in these areas.

In recent years, the people of our country have gained a lot in learning from the Soviet Union. We have learned how to manage many new large enterprises, we have learned how to operate many new machines, and we have been able to master many advanced Soviet working methods. The vast majority of our cadres, technicians, and workers and peasants are conscientiously learning from the Soviet Union. However, we must point out that we still have shortcomings in learning from Soviet advanced experience. We know that the biggest obstacle to learning is pride and complacency. However, some of our intellectuals and technicians are still satisfied with their own set of old knowledge and old technologies, and hold a contemptuous or distrustful attitude towards Soviet advanced experience. There are also some comrades who have the problems of empiricism and conservatism, sticking to the old ways and refusing to learn new things from the Soviet Union. There are also some people who feel that they have learned enough after learning a little, and are unwilling to learn from Soviet advanced experience more deeply and systematically. It should be especially pointed out that some of our comrades still do not pay enough attention to, are not humble enough, and are not serious enough in the process of learning from Soviet experts. All of the above ideas and practices are wrong. We should learn from the Soviet Union sincerely, honestly, and diligently in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, and avoid any exaggeration and pride. We must learn from the Soviet Union in an all-round way. For example, we must not only see the construction achievements and happy life of the Soviet people, but also see and earnestly learn from the spirit of selfless labor, hard struggle, and their high communist moral qualities; we must not only learn from Soviet science and technology, but also learn from Soviet politics. In addition, we must combine the actual conditions of China with the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, we must understand the spirit and essence of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and then combine it with the specific conditions of our country to apply it correctly, and do not copy it mechanically regardless of the conditions. All of these are what we should pay attention to. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association should take on more responsibilities in promoting the movement to learn from the Soviet Union, provide more assistance to all parties, and complete this arduous organizational task.

Third, vigorously strengthen the work of introducing the new China to the Soviet people. The Chinese and Soviet peoples are the closest and most loyal friends, and we must continue to increase mutual understanding to deepen and consolidate this sacred friendship. We should introduce the construction achievements and living conditions of the new Chinese people, and introduce our excellent literary and artistic creations and scientific achievements to the Soviet people in a more planned, more organized and more timely manner. We must improve our exhibition work and strengthen our work of sending delegations and donating books and films.

The above is what the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association must focus on in the current major tasks. If we can do these tasks well, then we will make greater contributions to further consolidating and developing the friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, promoting the construction of our motherland, and striving for lasting world peace.

Comrades! At present, the people of our country are fighting with full confidence for the liberation of Taiwan and the construction of socialism. We have fierce enemies in front of us. American imperialism is using all despicable and shameless means to try to undermine our construction cause. It is sending batches of spies and bandits to our country, it is implementing a blockade against our country, and in particular, it continues to occupy our sacred territory of Taiwan, and keeps a small group of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique, instructing them to step up their destructive and harassing war against our country. But we have full confidence to complete our great cause, because our cause is just. We are by no means isolated in our struggle, we have strong friends, first of all, the most powerful bulwark of world peace, our most reliable ally - the great Soviet Union, as well as various people's democratic countries and all peace-loving countries and people in the world. We should work a hundred times harder, develop and consolidate the friendly unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and strengthen the forces of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Vice-Chairman Soong Ching Ling pointed out in her speech at the meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in September 1949: "Sino-Soviet cooperation is a powerful guarantee for the victory of peace and democracy. When the people of the two countries unite together, they will be able to overcome all difficulties. Therefore, we must strengthen and consolidate the friendship between the people of the two countries to crush the conspiracy of the world's new war instigators." We believe that due to the efforts of all of us, the friendly unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples will be further strengthened. We will be able to overcome all difficulties and defeat all enemies at home and abroad.

Let the instigators of a new world war tremble before the iron unity of our Chinese and Soviet peoples!

Long live the great and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

    中苏友好协会五年来工作的报告
    中苏友好协会总干事  钱俊瑞主席、各位代表、各位来宾：
    中苏友好协会总会干事会委托我向本会第二次代表会作本会五年来工作的报告，请大会给以审查。
    我们记得，当一九四九年十月五日中苏友好协会总会举行成立大会的时候，本会会长刘少奇同志在他的报告中就明确地指出，由于中华人民共和国的成立，“中国历史从此已经进入一个完全新的时代，这也就使中苏两国人民的友谊进入一个完全新的时代。现在世界上已经没有一种力量能够阻止与破坏我们两国人民的友谊与合作了，我们两国人民的友谊与合作，从此可以无限量地发展和巩固起来了。”五年来形势的发展，完全证实了刘少奇会长论断的正确。
    大家记得，是我们最伟大的友邦苏联，在我们中华人民共和国成立的第二天，第一个承认新中国，并和我国建立了外交关系。接着，在一九五○年二月十四日，在斯大林同志和毛泽东同志的亲自指导下，中苏两国就签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约。这个条约把中苏两国人民之间伟大的永恒的友好关系用条约的形式固定了下来。由于这个条约的签订，我们中华人民共和国就有了最伟大的同盟国，并从它那里得到最坚强有力的友好支持。而中苏两国的强大同盟，也就从此作为保卫远东与世界和平的最可靠的堡垒出现在国际舞台上了。
    五年来，苏联对我国的经济建设给予了全面的系统的和无私的援助。在我国人民面临艰巨的经济恢复的任务时，苏联给予我国三亿美元的长期低利贷款。用这项贷款，并通过两国之间的不断增长的贸易关系，就使我们得到了恢复和建设所需要的种种器材。苏联政府还答应我国政府的请求，派来大批学识经验丰富的专家，帮助我们的各项建设事业。由于苏联专家们卓越和忘我的劳动，他们帮助我们克服缺乏经验和技术的困难，并为我国培养建设干部创造了良好的条件。从一九五三年起，我国开始了第一个五年计划的建设。苏联政府对我国的第一个五年计划实行大力的支援，经两国政府商谈，苏联答应在我国新建和改建的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程中，给予我们系统的经济和技术援助，这些工程包括钢铁联合企业、有色冶金企业、煤矿、炼油厂、机器制造厂、汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂、飞机制造厂、电力站、化学工厂等，它们构成了我国第一个五年计划的骨干。此外，苏联对我国的其他方面也给予了巨大的帮助。
    五年来，中苏两国在国际事务中互相支援与合作，在挫败帝国主义的战争计划、缓和国际紧张局势、保卫远东与世界和平方面得到了巨大的胜利。大家知道，自从第二次世界大战后，美帝国主义就继承了德国和日本法西斯的衣钵，妄想奴役和统治全世界，准备发动新的世界战争。一九五○年六月，也就是中华人民共和国成立还不到一年的时候，美国就悍然发动了侵朝战争，并在同时宣布侵占我国的领土台湾和加紧干涉印度支那战争。美帝国主义的侵略造成了远东以至全世界极为严重的形势。但是，由于中苏两国坚定不移地为和平而奋斗，由于朝中人民军队的英勇作战，美帝国主义在朝鲜遭到了可耻的失败，终于在一九五三年七月被迫接受停战。接着，在今年举行的日内瓦会议上，由于苏、中、越坚持维护和平和国际合作的政策，击破了美国的无理阻挠和破坏，又使恢复印度支那的和平问题达成了协议。
    苏联一贯为恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利而斗争。苏联这种正义的主张，已经受到全世界人民的普遍的响应。美国侵略集团及其追随者的无理阻挠，已经越来越孤立了。
    今年十月中苏两国政府举行的会谈，更标志着中苏友好合作新发展的里程碑。在会谈后，两国政府发表的联合宣言中，重申两国在保卫两国安全和维护远东和世界和平方面的行动一致，两国一致谴责美国无理阻挠中华人民共和国在联合国取得合法地位的政策，谴责美国对中华人民共和国的直接侵略行为，特别是它对中国领土台湾的继续侵占以及它对蒋介石卖国集团的军事和财政援助，并坚决谴责东南亚侵略军事集团的建立。在对日本关系上，两国政府一致声明日本应得到完全的民族独立，建立自己的民主制度，发展自己独立的和平经济和民族文化，并表示愿意采取步骤使它们同日本的关系正常化。此外，两国政府根据新的形势商定苏军从中苏共用的旅顺口海军根据地撤退。两国政府还商定将中苏各合股企业里的苏联股份移交给中国。在这次会谈中和会谈后，还商定苏联政府进一步扩大对我国建设的援助，并帮助我国组织大型的国营谷物农场。
    由以上所说，人们可以看到，中苏两国的伟大友谊在过去五年中是已经空前地发展了。这种永恒的牢不可破的友谊今后将永久地发展和巩固下去，这是肯定无疑的。这个友谊的存在和发展不但对我国社会主义建设的成功具有极其巨大的作用，而且对整个世界局势的发展也具有极其巨大的作用。事实证明，正是由于强大的中苏同盟的存在和发展，由于以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的不断壮大，由于全世界和平力量的增长，美国侵略集团无论在东方和西方都曾一次又一次地受到严重的打击和挫败。
    五年前在中苏友好协会成立的时候，刘少奇会长又明确地指出：组织中苏友好协会的目的，“就是要增进与巩固中苏两国人民的兄弟般的友谊和合作，促进中苏两大民族的一切智慧和经验的交流”。五年来，我们就是按照刘少奇会长的这个指示并且遵照会章规定的本会宗旨，来进行我们的工作的。
    第一、中苏友好协会曾努力增进和巩固了中苏两国人民的友谊。中苏友好协会从成立之日起就开始了在广大群众中进行关于发展和巩固中苏友好的国际主义的宣传教育工作。在本会成立的初期，我们曾和各方面联合，通过欢迎以法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫为首的苏联文化、科学、艺术工作者代表团的活动，庆祝十月革命三十二周年，庆祝斯大林同志七十寿辰，特别是庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，展开了大规模的中苏友好宣传运动。这些活动对于肃清国内外敌人反苏宣传的余毒起了重要的作用。在抗美援朝运动中，中苏友好协会广泛地展开了关于世界两大阵营力量的对比的宣传，增强了人民群众的胜利信心，增进了群众对苏联的信任和热爱。特别要提出的是一九五二年十月革命节时举行的“中苏友好月”。这是我国历史上规模最大的一次全民性的对苏友好运动。通过这次运动，中苏友好基本上达到了家喻户晓、深入人心的程度。
    中苏双方互相派遣代表团是增进友谊的有效方式。五年来，中苏两国人民的代表团来往很频繁，其中由本会邀请和接待的苏联代表团有七个，本会应邀组织的访苏代表团有四个；另外，由中苏双方组织了更多的代表团和参观团。这些代表团和参观团的活动，对增进中苏两国的友谊和相互了解起了很大的作用。
    第二、推动学习苏联。本会从成立以来就通过各种方式，如组织讲演会、报告会，出版书刊、宣传材料，举办图片展览，放映电影，举办业余俄文学校、俄文图书馆等，介绍苏联人民建设共产主义的成就，和他们建设社会主义的经验。据不完全的统计，截至今年八月，中苏友好协会组织讲演会、报告会达十九万六千余次，听众四千三百余万人；出版宣传材料一千多种，印发两千多万册；举办图片展览十一万八千余次，观众一亿二千三百多万人；举办俄文夜校四百余班，学员两万三千多人。这些工作大大增进了群众对苏联的认识，从而鼓舞了向苏联学习和建设社会主义的热情。我们还邀请苏联的著名学者如尤金院士、奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫院士、彼得罗夫斯基院士、潘克拉托娃院士等，并且组织在我国工作的苏联专家，在我国各地作报告、讲演，进行座谈。特别应该指出，今年十月起在北京举行了大规模的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会，不到三个月，参观者就近三百万人。这些都给我国的经济和文化建设以很大的帮助。
    不少地方的中苏友好协会直接参加了推广苏联先进经验的活动，如组织工矿企业举办学习苏联先进经验的座谈会、展览会，组织科学技术界、医学界举行学习苏联科学的座谈会等，收到了相当的效果。
    各地中苏友好协会在国家过渡时期总任务的宣传中，曾作了有力的配合，用苏联建设社会主义的范例，向广大群众指明苏联人民走过的道路就是我们今天要走的道路，说明苏联的今天就是我们的明天。
    第三、向苏联人民介绍新中国人民的生活和建设成就。伟大的苏联人民作为中国人民最忠诚的朋友，迫切地要求了解新中国的各项建设和人民的实际生活。他们为中国人民在建设自己的新生活中的每一个胜利而感到兴奋和骄傲。中苏友好协会曾经常寄赠苏联对外文化协会和苏联其他团体或个人各种文化资料，如我国出版的书籍、期刊、美术作品复制品、照片、电影片、唱片、音乐录音带等。我们还常和有关的单位共同组织展览会到苏联展出，其中规模较大的有中华人民共和国文学与艺术展览会和中华人民共和国工艺美术展览会，特别是一九五三年在莫斯科举行的盛大的中华人民共和国工农业展览会，受到了苏联人民极其热烈的欢迎。今年本会派出的一个访苏代表团曾在苏联各大城市作了许多次介绍新中国各项建设情况的报告。这些工作对于增进苏联人民对新中国的了解都是很有帮助的。
    五年来中苏友好协会配合了国家的建设和中苏两国人民为保卫远东与世界和平的斗争，作了一定的工作，获得了一定的成绩。这些成绩是在中国共产党的正确领导下，在各民主党派、人民团体的大力支持和协助下，在全体会员的努力下，也是在苏联友人、特别是苏联对外文化协会的热情帮助下取得的。但我们的工作还有不少缺点，如工作还不够深入，和各方面的联系合作还不够紧密，还没有充分地运用社会力量和各方面的宣传力量。这些缺点我们必须在今后的工作中坚决加以克服。
    目前，我国人民正在进行伟大的社会主义建设。这种建设将使我们永远摆脱剥削和贫困，使我们的祖国成为繁荣幸福的社会主义国家。我们面前的任务是十分艰巨的，而学习苏联和得到苏联的援助，乃是我国胜利地进行社会主义建设的重要条件。因此我们必须继续加强中苏两国的友好合作，更加认真地学习苏联。这是一方面。另一方面，尽管由于中苏两国的团结奋斗，由于全世界爱好和平的人民的团结奋斗，和平事业得到了不断的胜利，但是美国侵略集团绝不会因此而自动放弃它的侵略野心和挑拨战争的阴谋。正相反，他们正因自己的失败而更加疯狂地实行扩军备战政策，制造国际紧张局势。在欧洲，在臭名昭著的“欧洲防务集团”计划被欧洲人民打碎了以后，美国和它的追随者们又急急忙忙地签订了“巴黎协定”，其目的仍然是重新武装西德，制造新的大战。在东方，美国不但千方百计地阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，还悍然组织东南亚侵略集团，阴谋破坏印度支那的和平协议，最近更和蒋介石卖国集团签订了美蒋战争条约，坚决与我国人民为敌。因此，全世界和平、民主的力量还必须作长期艰巨的努力，尤其是我们中苏两国人民必须更加紧密地团结，来保卫世界和平，制止新战争的威胁。
    根据这样的形势和我们国家的总任务，中苏友好协会今后应该在原有工作的基础上，进一步地发展和巩固中苏两国的友好关系，继续增进中苏两国文化、经济及各方面的联系和合作，更好地介绍和推动学习苏联的先进经验和科学技术成就，更加加强中苏两国在争取世界持久和平的共同斗争中的紧密团结。为此，我们应该着重做好下述几项工作：
    第一、继续努力增进和巩固中苏友谊。几年来，中苏两国人民友好合作的辉煌业迹和中苏友好的宣传教育，已经大大提高了我国人民群众的国际主义的认识，中苏友好已经成为全中国人民的坚定不移的意志。但是，我们还不能说，各种有害于中苏友谊的思想已经完全肃清了。在我国人民中间，至今还有一些人对中苏友好合作抱着怀疑的态度，另外有些人则有单纯依赖甚至沾光、讨便宜等错误的思想。更加不能忽视的，在目前形势下，国内外敌人正在处心积虑地制造反苏谰言，挑拨中苏关系。因此，我们必须在广大人民群众中，结合当前的形势和任务，针对群众的思想情况，更加普遍与深入地进行中苏友好的国际主义教育，更加增进和巩固中苏两国人民的伟大友谊。要用生动具体的事例，反复宣传中苏友好是我们中苏两国人民的最高利益，从根本上讲清中苏友好的基本道理。同时，要及时揭穿国内外敌人的反苏谣言，指出这些谣言的反动本质。在这方面，中苏友好协会应该更加紧密和各方面的配合，更好地发挥各种宣传武器的力量，改进中苏友好报和其他宣传资料的工作，以扩大宣传的效果，保证中苏友好合作有更结实的思想基础。
    第二、加强开展学习苏联的运动。在我国开始第一个五年计划建设的时候，毛主席就曾在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议的讲话中号召我们“必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”随着国家建设规模的扩大和工作的深入，我们学习苏联的任务是日益迫切和艰巨了。今后我们必须更好地响应毛主席的号召，认真地学习联共（布）党史、学习苏联各项先进经验和科学技术知识。我们特别要注意向在我国工作的苏联专家们学习，他们是近在我们身边的好老师。中苏友好协会在这些方面应该作更多和更好的组织工作和供应资料的工作。
    几年来，我国人民在学习苏联方面是有很大收获的。许多新的大企业我们学会管理了，许多新的机器我们学会操纵了，许多苏联先进的工作方法我们能够掌握了。我们绝大部分的干部、技术人员和广大的工农群众都在认真地学习苏联。但是，我们须要指出，在学习苏联先进经验方面我们还是有缺点的。我们知道，学习的最大障碍是骄傲自满。可是我们的一部分知识分子和技术人员，至今还满足于自己的一套旧知识、旧技术，对苏联的先进经验抱着轻视或者不信任的态度。还有一些同志有经验主义和保守的毛病，故步自封，不愿学苏联新鲜的东西。还有一些人则是学到了一点点，就觉得差不多了，不愿更加深入和系统地学习苏联先进经验，特别应该指出，我们还有些同志在向苏联专家学习的过程中还是不够重视、不够虚心、不够认真的。以上这些想法和做法都是不对的。我们应该依照毛主席的指示，诚心诚意地、老老实实地和勤勤恳恳地学习苏联，力戒任何的虚夸和骄傲。我们要全面地学习苏联，例如我们既要看到苏联人民的建设成就和幸福生活，更加要看到和认真学习苏联人民的忘我劳动、艰苦奋斗的精神和他们高度的共产主义道德品质；既要学习苏联的科学和技术，又要学习苏联的政治。此外，我们学习苏联先进经验，必须结合中国的实际，必须领会苏联先进经验的精神和实质，再结合我国的具体条件，正确地运用，而不要不顾条件，生套硬搬。所有这些，都是我们应该注意的。中苏友好协会在推动学习苏联的运动中，应当担负起更多的责任来，对各方面作更多的帮助，来完成这一艰巨的组织任务。
    第三、大力加强向苏联人民介绍新中国的工作。中苏两国人民是最亲密最忠诚的朋友，我们必须继续增进互相间的了解，来加深和巩固这种神圣的友谊，我们应当更有计划、更有组织地并且更加及时地，向苏联人民介绍新中国人民的建设成就和生活状况，介绍我国优秀的文学艺术创作和科学成就。要改进我们的展览工作，加强我们派遣代表团和赠送书刊影片的工作。
    以上所说，就是中苏友好协会当前必须着重进行的几项重大工作。我们如果能够做好这几项工作，那么我们对于进一步巩固和发展中苏两国的友谊合作、推进我们祖国的建设和争取世界的持久和平就将作出更大的贡献。
    同志们！目前我们全国人民正在信心百倍地为解放台湾和建设社会主义而奋斗。在我们面前有着凶恶的敌人。美帝国主义正在用一切卑鄙无耻的手段，企图破坏我们的建设事业。它向我国派遣成批的间谍和匪徒，它对我国实行封锁，特别是它继续侵占着我国的神圣领土台湾，并豢养着一小撮蒋介石卖国集团，指使他们加紧对我国的破坏性与骚扰性的战争。但是我们有充分的信心来完成自己伟大的事业，因为我们的事业是正义的。我们在斗争中也决然不是孤立的，我们有坚强的朋友，首先是世界和平的最强大的堡垒、我国最可靠的盟邦——伟大的苏联，同时有各人民民主国家和全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民。我们应当百倍地努力工作，发展和巩固中苏两国人民的友好团结，壮大以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量。宋庆龄副会长在一九四九年九月中苏友协总会筹备委员会会议上的讲话中曾经指出：“中苏合作是和平与民主胜利的有力保证。两国人民团结在一起，就能够克服一切困难。因此，我们必须加强和巩固两国人民的友谊，以粉碎世界新战争制造者的阴谋。”我们相信，由于我们大家的努力奋斗，中苏两国人民的友好团结一定能够更加加强。我们一定能够克服一切困难，一定能够战胜国内外一切敌人。
    让世界新战争的挑拨者在我们中苏两国人民钢铁般的团结前面发抖罢！
    中苏两国人民的伟大的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
