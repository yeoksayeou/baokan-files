    China's Automobile Tires Can Now Be Self-Sufficient
    China's automobile tires can now be self-sufficient. The vast majority of passenger and freight vehicles in the transportation sector use domestically produced tires, and large carts and horse-drawn carts in rural areas have also begun using domestically produced tires. Before liberation, almost all automobile tires used in China relied on foreign imports. In the early days of liberation, the domestic demand for tires was also largely supplied by imports. However, in the past two years, domestically produced tires have not only been able to basically meet domestic needs, but also have some products exported. New domestic tire products are increasing every year, and the quality is also continuously improving, which ensures timely supply and enables the transportation sector to reduce transportation costs.

    我国汽车轮胎已能自给
    我国汽车轮胎已能自给。交通部门客运、货运汽车绝大部分使用国产轮胎，农村中的大车、马车也用上了国产轮胎。解放以前，我国所用的汽车轮胎，差不多全赖国外进口，解放初期，国内需用轮胎也大部靠进口供给。但近两年来，国产轮胎不但能基本上满足国内的需要，并且还有部分产品出口。国产轮胎新产品每年都有增加，质量也在不断改进，这就保证了及时供应，使运输部门降低了运输成本。
