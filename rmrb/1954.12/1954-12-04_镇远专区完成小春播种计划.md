The Zhenyuan Special District in Guizhou Province has exceeded its spring sowing plan. The original plan for the district called for an increase of about 70% in the rapeseed planting area compared to last year, and an increase of about 40% in barley and wheat. Now, the actual rapeseed planting area has increased by about 90% compared to last year, and barley and wheat have increased by more than 70% compared to last year. Among them, rapeseed in Lushan County has more than doubled compared to last year.

In the sowing and cultivation of spring crops, various counties have adopted a series of technical measures to increase yield per unit area. Many districts and townships in Lushan, Yuqing, Cengong, Taijiang and other counties have changed their past habits of not applying base fertilizer and not selecting improved varieties, and have partially changed broadcasting to strip sowing. Some areas of Yuqing County have now begun to thin seedlings, loosen soil, weed, and topdress spring crops. After discovering that rapeseed was suffering from insect pests, the E’shui Agricultural Production Cooperative in the county actively captured them and used pesticides to control them, ensuring the healthy growth of rapeseed. 60% of the spring crops planted by the Tuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongxi Township, Zhenyuan County, have been thinned and weeded.

    镇远专区完成小春播种计划
    贵州省镇远专区已超额完成小春播种计划。原来全区播种小春的计划要求油菜播种面积比去年扩大百分之七十左右，大麦、小麦比去年扩大百分之四十左右。现在，实际播种油菜面积已比去年扩大了百分之九十左右，大麦、小麦已比去年扩大了百分之七十以上。其中炉山县油菜比去年扩大两倍。
    各县在小春的播种和培育中，采取了一系列提高单位面积产量的技术措施。炉山、余庆、岑巩、台江等县不少区乡改变了过去不施底肥、不选良种的习惯，并部分地将撒播改成了条播。余庆县部分地区目前已开始进行小春的匀苗、松土、锄草、追肥等工作。该县鹅水农业生产合作社发现油菜遭受虫害后，积极进行捕捉，并用农药防治，保证了油菜的健壮成长。镇远县涌溪乡团结农业生产合作社所种的小春已有百分之六十进行了匀苗、薅淋工作。
