    Dujiangyan Expansion Project Begins
    The Dujiangyan expansion project officially commenced on December 1st. In addition to extending the main canal of the Guan Canal, increasing irrigation for 510,000 mu of farmland in Guanghan and other counties, the expansion project will also start from Gongyi Township in Chongqing County and excavate a 38-kilometer-long water diversion canal to divert water from the Shagou River of the outer river of Dujiangyan to irrigate 250,000 mu of farmland. A total of 168 large and small projects will be built for the water diversion canal, excavating more than 1 million cubic meters of earthwork. The 26,000 civilian workers participating in the construction are working hard. After this project is completed next spring, the total amount of farmland irrigated by Dujiangyan will increase from more than 3 million mu to 4 million mu. (Our Sichuan Reporter Station)
