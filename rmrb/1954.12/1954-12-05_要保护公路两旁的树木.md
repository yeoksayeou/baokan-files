    To Protect Trees Along Highways

    Li Guangyi of the Chinese Communist Party, Jincheng County Committee, Shanxi Province, writes: Some time ago, while working in the countryside, I discovered that the trees along the highways were not being cared for. Some trees that had been planted for several years had overgrown branches because they had not been pruned for many years; some small trees that had been newly planted in the past two years were being trampled and gnawed by cattle and sheep beyond recognition; and a small number of trees had been casually cut down and used by farmers. It is hoped that local government agricultural and forestry departments will strengthen inspections regularly and prune the trees annually, and educate farmers along the highways to cherish public trees.

    要保护公路两旁的树木
    中共山西晋城县委员会李广义来信：前些时我下乡工作，发现公路两旁的树木有无人护理的现象。有些种植几年的树木，因为多年没人修理，长得枝杈横生；有些近二年新植的小树，被牛羊践踏啃啮得不像样子；还有少数的树已被农民随便砍去用了。希望各地政府农林部门平时加强检查，每年定期修理，并教育公路沿线的农民爱护公共树木。
