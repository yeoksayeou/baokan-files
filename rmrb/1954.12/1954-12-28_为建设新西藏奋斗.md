    Striving to Build a New Tibet
    Youth Hero of a Certain Division of the People's Liberation Army, Yang Mao
    When the Kangzang Highway opened to traffic, an irrepressible excitement surged within me, and countless thoughts flooded my mind. In 1950, my comrades and I came to the Kangzang Plateau. On May 18th, we first raised our sledgehammers and drilled the first blasting hole. With the booming sound of the mountain-opening artillery, a wide road emerged from the top of Erlang Mountain. From here, the highway rapidly stretched westward.
    On the Que'er Mountain, 5,300 meters above sea level, comrades worked day and night. Everyone knew about the "cold," the "chill," and the "hardship." However, for the happiness of the Tibetan people, comrades could endure any difficulty. It was here that the outstanding Communist Party member, Comrade Zhang Fulin, gave his precious life. The spirit of the martyr burned in the hearts of every comrade, becoming an invincible force. One difficulty after another bowed before us. Que'er Mountain, which even birds found difficult to fly over, can now be traversed smoothly by the people's cars.
    In the winter of 1953, we were in Qucilameng. In the depths of winter, water froze into ice, and our hands and feet cracked open. Comrades used adhesive tape to stick them together and continued to work as usual. We also launched a labor emulation drive, putting forward the slogan "Compare depth through unity and mutual assistance, conquer the mountain with bravery and tenacity." The forty-meter-high cliff was finally opened ahead of schedule at the end of the year.
   In 1954, during the decisive battle for the Kangzang Highway, road construction in the Bomi area coincided with the rainy season. Mountain torrents hindered the progress of the project. Comrades extensively launched a rationalization proposal campaign, overcoming nature with the spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and floods give way."
    What force supported our tenacity? It was the Party, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country. I will never forget the visit of the National People's慰問団慰问团 in 1954, which called us the "most beloved people." Each of us cherished and valued this glorious title as if it were our life. Under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's national policy, Tibetan compatriots warmly supported us. I will never forget the scene of Tibetan old women bringing tea to our mouths, caring for us like their own children.
    With the opening of the Kangzang Highway, the close connection between the interior and the border areas has been further strengthened. This connection will enable Tibetan compatriots to achieve further consolidation and development in politics, economy, and culture. This year, when I went to the Southwest Highway Engineering Bureau to attend the labor model conference, the Tibetan people along the way warmly greeted us, filled with love for us. In Ganzi, I saw newly built buildings, hospitals, power plants, farms, and so on, and I felt that the construction prospects of the Kangzang Plateau were infinitely bright and beautiful.
    In the process of building the Kangzang Highway, although I have fulfilled a glorious responsibility to the motherland, this is only the beginning of my awakening. Under the beacon of the general line, I will definitely study harder and strive to build a new Tibet.

### 为建设新西藏奋斗

    为建设新西藏奋斗
    人民解放军某师青年英雄　杨茂
    当康藏公路通车的时候，有一种压制不住的兴奋心情冲动着我，千丝万缕的事情一齐涌现在脑子里。在一九五零年我和战友们来到康藏高原，五月十八日，我们第一次举起铁锤，打了第一个炮眼，随着轰隆隆的开山炮声，二郎山顶闪出一条宽阔的公路。从这里，公路迅速向西伸长。
    在海拔五千三百公尺高的雀儿山上，同志们夜以继日地工作着，“寒”、“冷”、“苦”谁都知道。可是，为了藏族人民的幸福，同志们什么困难都能忍受。就在这里，优秀的共产党员张福林同志献出了他宝贵的生命。烈士的精神在每个同志的心里燃烧着，成了一种无坚不摧的力量，一个接一个的困难在我们面前低头了。飞鸟都难飞过的雀儿山，现在人民的汽车可以畅行无阻。
    一九五三年冬天我们在曲次拉蒙，十冬腊月，滴水成冰，手脚裂成一道一道的口子，同志们用胶布一黏，照样工作。并且展开了劳动竞赛，提出“团结互助比深度，英勇顽强攻山头”的口号，四十公尺高的石崖终于在年底提前辟开。
   一九五四年，康藏公路的决战任务中，在波密地区筑路，正逢大雨季，山洪阻碍了工程进度，同志们广泛地开展了合理化建议运动，以“叫高山低头，洪水让路”的精神，战胜了自然。
    什么力量支持着我们这样顽强呢？是党、毛主席和全国人民。我永远忘不了一九五四年全国人民慰问团对我们的慰问，称我们是“最可爱的人”，这个光荣的称号，我们每个人都像生命一样的爱护它，珍惜它。在毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，藏族同胞热情的支援我们。我永远忘不了藏族老大娘像关心儿女一样，将茶水送到我们嘴边上的情景。
    随着康藏公路通车，进一步加强了内地与边疆的密切联系，这种联系将会使藏族同胞在政治、经济、文化上得到进一步的巩固发展。今年到西南公路工程局参加劳动模范会议，沿途的藏胞向我们热情的招呼，对我们充满了热爱。在甘孜我看到新建的楼房、医院、电厂、农场等，更感到康藏高原的建设远景是无限光明美好的。
    在修筑康藏公路的过程中，我虽然尽了对祖国应尽的一份光荣责任，但这只是我觉悟的开始，在总路线灯塔照耀下，我一定更加努力学习，为建设新西藏而奋斗。
