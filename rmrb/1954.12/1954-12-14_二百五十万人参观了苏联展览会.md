Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: The number of visitors to the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction has reached over 2,540,000.

　　Although the weather in Beijing is already severely cold, the average number of visitors still exceeds 20,000 per day. Chinese and Soviet staff members at the exhibition continue to explain and demonstrate various machines to the audience in the open-air plaza, braving the wind and cold.

　　The exchange of experiences at the exhibition is becoming increasingly widespread. To date, the exhibition has received over 1,300 questions from all over the country, and Soviet experts have already answered over 600 of them.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 13th: As of December 10th, 123,000 people from Tianjin had visited the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction in Beijing. Although there have been days of wind and snow recently, nearly a thousand people still go to Beijing to visit every day. Almost every factory and enterprise's employees have held seminars and discussions after returning from the visit. After discussing Soviet construction achievements, the employees of the Tianjin Water Company revised their production plans in November with five groups, increasing production targets. Workers at the jointly owned Hengyuan Textile Factory and Beiyang Yarn Factory were very interested in the automated textile machines at the exhibition. Fine yarn workers learned automated twisting and joining methods and have already begun to try them out. Maintenance workers at the Hengyuan Textile Factory also improved the "weft beater iron" on the looms based on the advantages of Soviet machines. Xie Maoxiang, a worker at the North China Animal Products Company, was inspired by seeing various advanced Soviet loading and unloading machines. He began to study ways to mechanize the loading and unloading of animal products and proposed rationalization suggestions for improving the operation of sorting pig bristles.

　　Members of the Li Jishun Agricultural Production Cooperative in the East Suburbs of Tianjin saw at the exhibition that the highest Soviet rice yield was more than 2,400 jin per mu (Chinese acre), converted from the Chinese mu measurement, which is more than double their highest yield this year. They specifically consulted Soviet experts. Soviet experts explained in detail the advanced experience of Soviet direct seeding of rice in dryland, deep plowing and close planting, and the rational application of fertilizer. More than a dozen cooperative members have returned to their hometowns and have begun to widely promote their gains at the exhibition to the farmers.
