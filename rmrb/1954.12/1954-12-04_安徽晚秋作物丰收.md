    Anhui Province drained waterlogged areas and replanted over 18.3 million mu of various late autumn crops in disaster areas. Farmers in non-disaster areas adopted methods such as intercropping, mixed cropping, reclaiming wasteland, and cultivating regenerated rice and regenerated sorghum, increasing the planting of late autumn crops by over 19 million mu. The province as a whole increased the planting of late autumn crops by over 37 million mu. These late autumn crops are nearing the end of harvesting, and most have yielded good harvests. Late rice yielded 70 to 100 jin per mu, while regenerated rice and dryland grain crops averaged over 35 jin per mu. The best regenerated rice cultivated in the Anqing Special District yielded about 150 jin per mu. Jiuhe Township in Xuancheng County has harvested 887 mu of regenerated rice, with an average yield of 115 jin per mu. According to preliminary statistics, the province can harvest a total of 1.5 billion jin of grain.
    The harvest of late autumn crops replanted after the disaster has greatly boosted the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. Currently, farmers in disaster areas are actively carrying out production self-rescue, rushing to plant wheat and early-maturing crops in areas where the water has receded, and engaging in diverse sideline production to continue to overcome the disaster.

    安徽晚秋作物丰收
    安徽省灾区排水补种各种晚秋作物一千八百三十余万亩，非灾区农民采用套种、间种、开荒和培育再生稻、再生秫秫等办法，增植晚秋作物一千九百余万亩，全省共计增植晚秋作物三千七百余万亩。这些晚秋作物快收割完毕，大部收成还好。晚稻每亩达七十斤至一百斤，再生稻和旱粮作物每亩平均达三十五斤以上。安庆专区培育的再生稻，最好的每亩收一百五十斤左右。宣城县九合乡已收再生稻八百八十七亩，平均每亩产量达一百十五斤。据初步统计，全省共可收粮食十五亿斤。
    灾后补种的晚秋作物的收获，大大鼓舞了广大农民的生产积极性。现在，灾区农民正积极开展生产自救，在已退水的地方抢种小麦和早熟作物，并进行多种多样的副业生产，以继续战胜灾荒。
