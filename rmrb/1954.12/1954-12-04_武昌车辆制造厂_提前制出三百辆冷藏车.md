Wuchang Vehicle Manufacturing Plant
Ahead of Schedule, Produces Three Hundred Refrigerated Cars

The Wuchang Vehicle Manufacturing Plant completed its annual task of manufacturing three hundred refrigerated cars ahead of schedule on November 28th. On the morning of the 28th, after the painters put a silver-gray coat on the last new refrigerated car, all three hundred refrigerated cars left the factory. These refrigerated cars have undergone strict inspection and fully meet the quality standards stipulated by the state.

The Wuchang Vehicle Manufacturing Plant was originally a railway repair factory. Only last year the state decided to convert it into a manufacturing plant. This year, it accepted the arduous task of newly building three hundred refrigerated cars. In the production process, the workers overcame various difficulties, ensuring that the refrigerated cars could still be dispatched normally in the hot season and persisting in production during flood prevention, creating conditions for completing the annual production plan ahead of schedule. After flood prevention, all the workers in the plant launched a labor competition and gradually adjusted the labor organization and assembly line in the final assembly workshop, eliminating the unreasonable phenomenon of parts frequently crossing sections and workshops in the past, improving the completeness of product parts, and ensuring balanced dispatch of vehicles. The plant's vehicle dispatch equilibrium rate reached 100% in October, breaking through the weak link of uneven production in previous months. At the same time, product quality has greatly improved, and product costs have continued to decline. Most importantly, the quality (yield rate) of steel castings in October increased by 6.91% compared to the national target, and the unit product cost decreased by 8.72% compared to September, and 14.2% compared to the end of last year, exceeding the planned target for reducing unit costs this year.

Each of the new refrigerated cars produced by the plant can carry 30 tons of cargo. The car is equipped with cooling equipment that can hold seven tons of ice, and the surrounding area is equipped with very thick insulation boards. Even in the hottest summer, the temperature inside the car can often be maintained at around zero degrees Celsius. These vehicles can transport various fresh fish, shrimp, pork, eggs, fruits, and other foods in the hot summer; and in the colder winter, the heating equipment inside the car can appropriately increase the temperature to prevent food from freezing.

    武昌车辆制造厂
    提前制出三百辆冷藏车
    武昌车辆制造工厂已在十一月二十八日提前完成了全年制造三百辆冷藏车的任务。二十八日上午，油漆工人们给最后一辆新的冷藏车穿上了银灰色的外衣之后，三百辆冷藏车便全部出厂了。这些冷藏车经过严格检验，完全合乎国家规定的质量标准。
    武昌车辆制造工厂原是一个铁路修理工厂，去年才由国家决定改为制造工厂，今年，便接受了新造三百辆冷藏车的繁重任务。在生产过程中，工人们克服了各种困难，保证了冷藏车在气温较高的季节里仍然能照常出车，并在防汛中坚持了生产，给提前完成全年生产计划创造了条件。防汛结束后，全厂职工开展了劳动竞赛，并逐步地调整了总装车间的劳动组织和流水作业线，消灭了过去配件经常跨工段、跨车间的不合理现象，提高了产品零件的成套性，保证了均衡出车。该厂十月份的出车均衡率达到百分之百，突破了以往各月生产不均衡的薄弱环节，同时使产品质量有很大进步，产品成本不断下降。最主要的是钢铸件质量（成品率）在十月份较国家指标提高了百分之六点九一，产品单位成本就比九月份降低了百分之八点七二，比去年年终时降低百分之十四点二，超额完成了今年降低单位成本的计划指标。
    该厂新出产的冷藏车每辆能载重三十吨的货物，车内装置有能容冰七吨的冷却设备，四周并装有很厚的隔热板，即使在最热的夏季，车内温度经常可以保持在摄氏零度左右。这种车辆能够在酷热的夏天载运各种新鲜的鱼虾、猪肉、蛋品、水果等食物；而在气温较低的冬季里，车内的暖气设备又可适当地增高气温，不使食物冻坏。
