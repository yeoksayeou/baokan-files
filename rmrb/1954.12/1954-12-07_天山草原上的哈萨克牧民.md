    Kazakh Herdsmen on the Tianshan Grasslands
    Yuan Yibo
    In summer, the rolling valleys of the Tianshan grasslands are lush and green. The towering pines on the hillsides stand straight into the sky. The clear streams flow along the mountain gullies. Over two hundred yurts of Kazakh people are scattered in clusters of three or five across the lush summer pastures.
    The grasslands, freshly washed by a light rain, are infinitely tranquil. Young Kazakh women are milking cows, newborn foals are leaping with joy, and herds of sheep are grazing quietly. Tipei, a 56-year-old Kazakh herdsman, rides his horse, swings his herding whip, whistles, and gently calls out, "Sheep, sheep, move along!"
    Tipei is a member of the Musa Baike Mutual Aid Team in the second village of the eighth district of Urumqi County, Xinjiang. He has been herding sheep for thirty years, but he has never had as many livestock as he does this year. Five years ago, he was also herding sheep here, but he was herding for others and didn't even have a horse to ride. Even in the freezing cold of winter, he only wore a tattered sheepskin coat. Without socks, he wrapped his feet in scraps of sheepskin. When the sheep ran up the mountain, he followed; when the sheep ran down the mountain, he drove them back down. Sometimes his toes would freeze, and he still had to run behind the sheep. At night, he didn't even have his own yurt. He simply laid down on a tattered felt blanket at the entrance of someone else's yurt. He ate horse feed made of barley and highland barley.
    Things are different since Liberation. Tipei, like other poor herdsmen, received loans and grain relief from the People's Government. But at that time, because he had few livestock—only three sheep, one horse, and one cow—and only one laborer in the family, he was too busy herding livestock to cut and store winter grass, and he had no strength to build sheds for the livestock. During lambing and calving and when moving pastures, he couldn't manage alone. In 1952, he voluntarily joined the Musa Baike Mutual Aid Team, and this difficulty was resolved. In the mutual aid team, he was in charge of herding sheep, while other team members were responsible for tasks such as livestock birthing, cattle and horse herding, cutting and storing winter grass, and building sheds. This ensured the safe wintering of livestock and the survival of young animals. This year, he counted the mutual aid team's and his own livestock. The team's twenty-one households have increased their sheep from just over one hundred when the team was first organized to over five hundred, their cattle from over eighty to one hundred and sixty-nine, and their horses from around thirty to seventy-five. Now, he himself has twelve sheep, six cows, two horses, and a new yurt. His whole family can eat white flour and milk every day, and they also wear new leather boots and coats.
    There are many people like Tipei in this village. Anmaliya, a widow in the same mutual aid team, had her husband killed by Kuomintang secret agents five years ago, leaving her with only two horses, one cow, one cart, and two little girls under the age of ten. At that time, she sold a large cart and buried her husband with tears in her eyes. Soon after, the Usman bandit gang, lackeys of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, robbed her of her horses. She had to rely on relatives to survive with her two little girls, often eating one meal and going hungry for the next. After Liberation, she received relief from the People's Government, bought livestock, and voluntarily joined the Musa Baike Mutual Aid Team in 1952. She took on light work such as milking and shearing sheep, which solved the problem of labor shortage. Her livestock has increased year by year. This year, including the newborn young animals, she has eleven cows, eight sheep, and three horses.
    Under the policy of protecting and developing livestock production, including the pastoralist economy, the livestock of pastoralists has also increased compared to the past. Queyike, a pastoralist in the second village of this township, originally had more than 1,200 sheep. In the past, fearing robbery by the Usman bandit gang, he often drove his sheep from this mountain to that mountain, from the front mountain to the back mountain. Even in freezing weather, his sheep had to cross several mountains, trying to escape the eyes of the Usman bandit gang. But in hiding, the sheep couldn't graze, and they were exhausted and hungry. Most of them froze or starved to death in the snow, leaving only about four hundred. After the Usman bandit gang was suppressed, his livestock was protected by the People's Government. This year, all kinds of livestock have increased to more than six hundred. Now, his livestock can graze freely in pastures suitable for different seasons, allowing them to eat the best grass and water, and he no longer has to worry about someone stealing or running away with them.
    In the past five years, on the basis of stabilizing social order, the People's Government has resolutely implemented policies such as "no struggle, no division, no class labeling" and "benefits for both herdsmen and pastoralists" in pastoral areas, according to the principle of protecting and developing livestock production. It has led herdsmen to improve livestock feeding and management, prevented natural disasters, supplied production tools such as grass mowers, scythes, and hunting guns, and provided large amounts of loans and livestock to poor herdsmen. Like other pastoral areas, the number of livestock in the township has increased year by year, reaching 14,590 head this year, an increase of more than 6,000 head compared to five years ago. Now, all 274 herdsmen households in the township have livestock. Beike, a bachelor who had nothing in the past, now has his own yurt and livestock, and he has also married a wife and had a baby.
    With the development of production and state-owned trade, the living standards of herdsmen have generally improved. In the past, because livestock products could not be sold and were subject to price gouging by unscrupulous merchants, one sheep could only be exchanged for a brick of tea or a斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry measure) of wheat. If exchanged for cloth, it wasn't even enough for one person to make a set of clothes. But now, with state-owned trading companies, one sheep can be exchanged for more than ten bricks of tea or five sacks of white flour. If exchanged for cloth, it would be enough for six people to wear and still have some left over. Now, everyone in the second village can eat white flour. No matter which yurt you enter, hospitable Kazakhs will offer you mare's milk or milk tea. Muha Yi, a herdsman whose entire livestock, yurt, and all furniture were robbed by the Usman bandit gang, has now re-established his household in production, with more than forty sheep, as well as carts, cattle, and horses. To thank the Communist Party for the benefits it has brought to ethnic minorities, he rode a horse from Urumqi City, 150 miles away, to buy a portrait of Chairman Mao and hung it respectfully in the middle of his yurt. Whether moving from the spring pasture to the summer pasture or from the summer pasture to the autumn pasture, he always takes the portrait of Chairman Mao with him, carefully placing it in a box, and only after the pasture transfer is completed does he rehang the portrait of Chairman Mao in the middle of his yurt.
    The Kazakh herdsmen, who have begun to live a happy life on the Tianshan grasslands, all call Chairman Mao the sun. On the pasture, even ten-year-old herdsboys will sing: "Chairman Mao is like the sun, shining brightly everywhere..."

    天山草原上的哈萨克牧民
    袁逸波
    夏天，在天山草原上，起伏的山谷一片葱绿。山坡上的苍松直矗高空。清清的溪水顺着山涧流着。二百多个哈萨克人的毡房，三个五个一簇的散布在水草丰美的夏季牧场上。
    细雨刚淋过的草原无限宁静。年轻的哈萨克族妇女在乳牛旁挤着奶子，新生的马驹在欢乐的跳跃，成群的羊只在静静的吃草。已经五十六岁的哈萨克族老牧民提培骑在马上，挥动着牧羊鞭，吹着口哨，轻声地吆喝着：“羊儿、羊儿、快走！”
    提培是新疆乌鲁木齐县八区二乡木萨拜克互助组的组员。他已经牧放了三十年的羊群，但自己从来没有像今年这么多的牲畜。在五年以前，他也在这儿放羊，但那是替别人放羊，也没有马骑。就是在冰雪封冻的严寒里，他也只穿一件破羊皮大衣。脚上没有袜子，就用破羊皮把脚包起来。羊群跑上山，他就跟上山，羊群跑下山，他又赶下去，有时脚指冻僵了，还得跟着羊屁股后面跑。晚上睡觉也没有自己的毡房，他只是用一块破毡毯，铺在别人毡房的门口躺着。吃的是喂马的大麦和青稞。
    解放后可不同了。提培也像其他贫苦牧民一样，得到了人民政府贷款和贷粮的救济。但当时因为自己的牲畜少，只有三只羊、一匹马、一头牛，家里又只有一个劳动力，顾了牧放牲畜，就顾不得割储冬草，更没有力量替牲畜搭盖棚圈。在接羔育羔和转移牧场的时候，一个人也忙不过来。一九五二年，他自愿参加了木萨拜克互助组，这个困难也解决了。他在互助组里专管放羊，牲畜的产幼、牛马的牧放、割储冬草、搭盖棚圈等，都有其他组员分工负责，这样使牲畜的安全过冬和幼畜的成活，都有了保证。今年，他点了一点互助组和自己的牲畜，全组二十一户的羊只，已由刚组织时的一百多只增加到五百多只，牛由八十多头增加到一百六十九头，马由三十来匹增加到七十五匹。现在，他自己也有了十二只羊、六头牛、两匹马，还有新的毡房，全家每天都能吃到白面和奶子，还穿上了新的皮靴和大衣。
    像提培这样的人，在这个乡里很多。和他同一个互助组的寡妇安玛利亚，丈夫在五年前给国民党特务杀害了，只剩下两匹马、一头牛、一辆车，还有两个不到十岁的小女孩。当时她把一辆大车卖掉了，含着眼泪埋葬了丈夫。不久，美帝国主义和国民党反动派的走狗乌斯满匪帮又抢走了她的马匹。她只得带着两个小女孩倚靠亲戚度日，常常饱一顿饿一顿。解放后，她得到了人民政府的救济，买了牲畜，一九五二年也自愿参加了木萨拜克互助组，她担任挤牛奶、剪羊毛等轻劳动，这样就解决了缺乏劳动力的困难，她的牲畜也一年比一年增多。今年连新生的幼畜，已经有十一头牛、八只羊、三匹马了。
    在保护和发展包括牧主经济在内的畜牧业生产政策下，牧主的牲畜也比过去增加了。这个乡二村牧主却依克，原来有一千二百多只羊，过去因为怕乌斯满匪帮抢劫，常常把羊群从这个山赶到那个山，从前山又赶到后山，就是在冰天雪地里，他的羊只也要赶好几座山，想躲过乌斯满匪帮的眼睛，但躲来躲去，羊只吃不上草，跑得又累又饿，大部冻死或饿死在雪地上，最后只剩了四百来只。乌斯满匪帮被剿灭后，他的牲畜得到了人民政府的保护，今年各种牲畜已经增加到六百多只。现在，他的牲畜可以随着不同的季节，到各个季节的牧场自由牧放，使牲畜吃到最好的水草，再也不要担心有人会抢走或偷跑了。
    五年来，人民政府在安定了社会秩序的基础上，根据保护和发展畜牧业生产的方针，坚决执行了在牧区“不斗不分、不划阶级”、“牧工、牧主两利”等政策，领导牧民改进了牲畜的饲养管理，防止了自然灾害，供应了打草机、钐镰、猎枪等生产工具，对贫苦牧民又贷发了大批贷款和牲畜，全乡的牲畜和其他牧区一样，一年比一年增多，今年已经有各种牲畜一万四千五百九十头，比五年前增加了六千多头。现在全乡二百七十四户牧民，家家都有了牲畜。过去什么也没有的光棍别克，现在也有了自己的毡房和牲畜，还娶了老婆，生了娃娃。
    随着生产和国营贸易的发展，牧民的生活也普遍提高了。过去因为畜产品卖不出去，遭到奸商杀价，一只羊只能换到一块砖茶或者一斗小麦，假若换布，还不够一个人做一套衣服；可是现在有了国营的贸易公司，一只羊可以换十多块砖茶或五袋白面，假若换布，可以够六口人穿还多。现在，二乡每一个人都能吃到白面。你无论跑进那一个毡房，好客的哈萨克人都会端出马奶子或奶茶来殷勤招待。过去曾经给乌斯满匪帮抢光全部牲畜、毡房和全部家具的牧民木哈依，现在也重新在生产中建立起家务，有了四十多只羊，还有大车和牛马。他为了感谢共产党带给少数民族的好处，骑着马从一百五十里路外的乌鲁木齐市买回了毛主席的画像，恭恭敬敬地把它挂在毡房中间，无论从春牧场搬到夏牧场，从夏牧场搬到秋牧场，他总是把毛主席的画像带着，小心地放在箱子里，一定要等牧场转移完毕，他才把毛主席的画像重新挂在毡房中间。
    在天山草原上开始过着幸福生活的哈萨克族牧民，都把毛主席称作太阳。在牧场上，十来岁的牧童也会唱：“毛泽东像太阳，照到那里那里亮……”
