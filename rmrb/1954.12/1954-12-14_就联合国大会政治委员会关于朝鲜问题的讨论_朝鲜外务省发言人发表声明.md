Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 12th. According to the Korean Central News Agency on the 11th: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement regarding the discussion of the Korean issue at the Political Committee of the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, denouncing the so-called "Fifteen-Nation Proposal."

The statement described the various proposals made by Soviet representative Malik in the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly: inviting the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to participate the discussion on the Korean question, dissolving the illegally established United Nations "Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," and convening a conference of relevant countries on the Korean question in the near future. The statement said: The Soviet proposals would provide favorable conditions for the just resolution of the Korean question. However, the US representative and the representatives of other UN member states who followed the US, not only rejected the just proposals of the Soviet representative, but also passed the "Fifteen-Nation Proposal" which violates the wishes of the Korean people for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

The statement emphasized that any resolutions on the Korean issue unilaterally passed by the United Nations without the participation of representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are of no practical significance or legal effect. As the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made clear to the world at the Geneva Conference, the Korean question must be resolved by the Korean people themselves, based on all-Korean elections expressing the free will of the Korean people, without external interference. In order to realize this principle, the Korean people will continue to make every effort to promote the peaceful unification of Korea through consultation and negotiation.

    就联合国大会政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的讨论
    朝鲜外务省发言人发表声明
    【新华社平壤十二日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社十一日讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省发言人就联合国大会第九届会议政治委员会讨论朝鲜问题事发表声明，斥责所谓“十五国提案”。
    声明叙述了苏联代表马立克在联合国大会政治委员会上提出的各项建议：邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表和中华人民共和国代表参加关于朝鲜问题的讨论，解散非法成立的联合国“朝鲜统一复兴委员会”，在最近的将来召开关于朝鲜问题的有关国家的会议。声明说：苏联的建议将能够对朝鲜问题的正当解决提供有利的条件。但是，美国代表和追随美国的其它一些联合国会员国代表，不仅拒绝了苏联代表的正当提案，而且通过了违反朝鲜人民和平解决朝鲜问题愿望的
  “十五国提案”。
    声明强调说：在没有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加的情况下，联合国片面通过的关于朝鲜问题的一切决议是没有任何实际意义和法律效力的。正如朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表在日内瓦会议上向全世界所阐明的一样，朝鲜问题必须基于表现朝鲜人民自由意志的全朝鲜选举，在没有外力干涉的情形下，由朝鲜人民自己来解决。为了实现这一原则，朝鲜人民将继续进行一切努力，争取以协商和谈判方式，促进朝鲜的和平统一。
