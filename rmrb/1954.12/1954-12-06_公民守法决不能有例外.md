Newspaper Review:

    Citizens Must Abide by the Law Without Exception

    The Shanghai Jiefang Daily, on its second page on August 17th and October 17th, successively published sharp exposures and criticisms regarding a case of a state organ staff member illegally abusing children, and a People's Court president shielding an illegally acting cadre out of personal considerations.

    Jin Wei, a female staff member of the Shanghai Municipal Construction Committee, after marrying Yang Xiufeng, the president of the Shanghai Longhua District People's Court, regarded the three children born to Yang Xiufeng's ex-wife as thorns in her side and often abused them with cruel methods. Jin Wei once used the back of a knife to swell the hand of eight-year-old Yang Youhua, making it impossible for her to hold a bowl while eating or to hold a pen in class. Jin Wei also often slammed the head of another child, Yang Aihua, against the wall, causing her to bleed. Unable to bear this abuse, the children ran away from home on their own, enduring hunger and wandering the streets. In more than half a year, Yang Youhua ran away eight times, once "disappearing" for more than ten days.

    Yang Xiufeng, as the president of the People's Court, did not give correct criticism or education regarding Jin Wei's criminal behavior, nor did he take measures to protect the children according to the requirements of the people's laws. On the contrary, when others exposed Jin Wei's mistakes, he adopted an extremely erroneous attitude: trying his best to cover up Jin Wei's guilt in front of others, saying: "Jin Wei does not consistently abuse the children, the problem is not serious. There are many people in the dormitory, and the situation is exaggerated when reporting."

    The erroneous behavior of Jin Wei and Yang Xiufeng aroused the anger of nearby residents and cadres, who wrote letters to the Shanghai Jiefang Daily to lodge accusations. The Jiefang Daily used a short essay entitled "At the Home of the Court President" to conduct sharp exposure and criticism. The essay quoted Article 16 of the Marriage Law and Article 96 of the draft Constitution to prove that the errors of Jin Wei and Yang Xiufeng violated the laws of the People's Government. The essay sharply asked: "Do they think that the law also applies to the cadres of the People's Government—especially the president of the court?"

    This essay not only waged a struggle against Jin Wei's brutal behavior of abusing children under the control of feudal remnants of thought, but also waged a clear-cut struggle against Yang Xiufeng, Jin Wei, and others who, as staff members of state organs, knowingly violated the law and enforced it for personal gain, safeguarding the dignity of the people's laws. This struggle immediately won the support and resonance of the broad masses of the people. After this essay was published, within two months, readers from various parts of East China and Beijing, Anshan, Shenyang, Benxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and other places, as well as soldiers guarding the coastal defense front, sent more than one hundred letters to the newspaper, criticizing Jin Wei and Yang Xiufeng's mistakes, demanding that Jin Wei's abuse of her husband's ex-wife's children be stopped, and strengthening education on cadres' awareness of abiding by the law. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government and the Municipal People's Court also seriously handled this matter.

    The Shanghai Jiefang Daily comprehensively summarized these letters from readers on October 17th. At the same time, it also reported the results of the handling of this incident: Jin Wei has been sentenced to imprisonment by the Shanghai Municipal People's Court; Yang Xiufeng, in addition to receiving a public warning within the Party, has been removed from his post administratively. The newspaper also reported Yang Xiufeng's regret after being punished. Yang Xiufeng reviewed himself, saying: "The law applies to every citizen, whether you are a cadre or a member of the masses, whoever violates it should be sanctioned by the law. This is what I will always remember." The newspaper's complete reporting of this event further strengthened the effect of the criticism.

    The Shanghai Jiefang Daily's critical struggle against the mistakes of Jin Wei and Yang Xiufeng has profound educational significance for every Communist Party member and every staff member of state organs. Every Communist Party member and every staff member of state organs should modelly abide by state laws and conduct serious struggles against illegal phenomena. In particular, those who have a weak sense of abiding by the law or who adopt an attitude similar to Yang Xiufeng toward illegal phenomena should be doubly vigilant and actively correct their mistakes. Local newspapers should also pay attention to fighting against such errors and strengthen the propaganda of cadres' awareness of abiding by the law. (Yang Guang)

    公民守法决不能有例外
    上海解放日报在八月十七日和十月十七日的二版上，先后对于一件国家机关工作人员违法虐待子女，人民法院院长循私掩饰违法干部罪过的事情，进行了尖锐的揭发和批评。
    上海市政建设委员会的女工作人员金伟在和上海市龙华区人民法院院长杨秀峰结婚后，把杨秀峰前妻所生的三个孩子看作眼中钉，常常用残暴方法虐待他们。金伟曾用刀背把八岁的杨幼华的手砍肿，使她吃饭时不能端碗，上课时不能执笔。金伟还常把另一个孩子杨爱华的头揿住向墙壁上猛撞，以致流血。小孩子们受不了这种虐待，便私自跑出家来忍饥受饿流浪街头。在半年多的时间内，杨幼华竟出走八次，有一次“失踪”了十多天。
    身为人民法院院长的杨秀峰，对金伟的这种犯罪行为没有给予正确的批评、教育，更没有根据人民法律的要求采取保护儿童的措施。相反地他却在别人揭露金伟错误的时候采取了极端错误的态度：尽量设法在别人面前掩饰金伟的罪过。说：“金伟不是一贯虐待小孩的，问题并不严重。宿舍里人多复杂，反映情况时扩大事实。”
    金伟和杨秀峰的错误行为，引起了附近居民和干部的愤怒，他们纷纷写信给上海解放日报进行控诉。解放日报用一篇题名为“在法院院长的家里”的小品文进行了尖锐的揭露和批评。小品文引用婚姻法第十六条和宪法草案第九十六条的规定来证明金伟、杨秀峰的错误是触犯了人民政府的法律的。小品文尖锐地问道：“究竟他们认为法律是不是也适用于人民政府的干部——特别是法院院长呢？”
    这篇小品文不仅对在封建残余思想支配下的金伟虐害儿童的残暴行为进行了斗争，并且对杨秀峰、金伟等身为国家机关工作人员，知法犯法和执法循私的行为进行了立场鲜明的斗争，维护了人民法律的尊严。这个斗争立即获得广大人民的拥护和共鸣。这篇小品文发表后，两个月中就有华东各地和北京、鞍山、沈阳、本溪、湖南、广东等地的读者及守卫在海防前线的战士们寄给报社一百几十封信，批评金伟、杨秀峰的错误，要求制止金伟虐待其夫前妻所生子女的行为，并加强对干部的守法观念的教育。上海市人民政府和市人民法院，也对这件事进行了严肃的处理。
    上海解放日报十月十七日综述了读者的这些来信。同时还报道了这一事件的处理结果，金伟已被上海市人民法院判处徒刑；杨秀峰除在党内受了当众警告处分外，在行政上已被撤职。报纸并报道了杨秀峰受处分后的悔悟情形。杨秀峰检讨说：“法律适用于每个公民，不论你是干部或是群众，谁触犯了它谁就该受到法律的制裁。这是我将永远记取的。”报纸对这个事件作了有头有尾的报道，这就更加加强了批评的效果。
    上海解放日报对于金伟、杨秀峰的错误所进行的批评斗争，对每一个共产党员和每一个国家机关工作人员都有深刻的教育意义。每个共产党员和每个国家机关工作人员，都应该模范地遵守国家法律，并对违法现象进行严肃的斗争，特别是守法观念薄弱或对违法现象采取类似杨秀峰这种态度的人，更应加倍警惕和积极改正自己的错误。各地报纸也应该注意对这种错误进行斗争，并加强干部守法观念的宣传。　（阳光）
