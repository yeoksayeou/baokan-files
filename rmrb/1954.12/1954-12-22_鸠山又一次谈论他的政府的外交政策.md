    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 20th: Tokyo dispatch: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, on his campaign trip which began on the 19th, answered questions from journalists regarding the Japanese new government's foreign policy and other issues.

    Hatoyama stated that his government would not change the pro-American diplomacy of the Yoshida government. He explained: his government will "support the foreign policy consistently maintained by the previous Yoshida government." Hatoyama said that he "has no intention of changing Yoshida's foreign policy at all; on the contrary, I will try to concretely accomplish what the previous government wanted to do in its relations with the United States." He said: "It is necessary to increasingly deepen the friendly relations between Japan and the United States."

    At the same time, Hatoyama pointed out that if there is any difference between his government and the Yoshida government in terms of foreign policy, the only one is: his government opposes the Yoshida government's policy of "preventing Japan from conducting trade and exchanges with the Soviet Union and China." He also said: It is necessary to normalize Japan's diplomatic and trade ties with the Soviet Union and China.

    Hatoyama also delivered a speech in Nagoya. He reiterated his claim: steps should be taken to end the state of war between Japan and China and the Soviet Union. He said: as the first step in restoring relations, relevant countries should exchange commercial envoys.

    鸠山又一次谈论他的政府的外交政策
    【新华社二十日讯】东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎十九日在开始他的竞选旅行途中，答复了新闻记者提出的有关日本新政府的外交政策等问题。
    鸠山表示，他的政府不改变吉田政府的亲美外交。他解释说：他的政府将“支持前任吉田政府所一直保持的外交政策”。鸠山说，他“一点也不打算改变吉田的外交政策，相反，我将设法以具体的方式来完成前任政府在它和美国的关系方面所想要做的事情”。他说：“有必要愈益加深日本和美国的亲善关系”。
    同时，鸠山又指出，如果说他的政府同吉田政府在外交政策上有什么差别的话，唯一的就是：他的政府反对吉田政府的“阻止日本同苏联和中国进行贸易和往来”的政策。他又说：使日本同苏联和中国的外交和贸易联系正常化，是必要的。
    鸠山在名古屋又发表谈话。他重申了他的主张：应该采取步骤结束日本同中苏两国的战争状态。他说：作为恢复关系的第一步，有关国家应该互换商务使节。
