Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: The Ministry of Communications of the People's Republic of China and the Political Department of the Ministry of Communications of the People's Republic of China sent a congratulatory telegram to all commanders, fighters, workers, and laborers participating in the construction of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways. The full text is as follows: Lhasa, Ya'an, Xining Preparatory Committee for the Celebration of the Opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways, forwarded to all commanders, fighters, workers, and laborers participating in the construction of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways:

    The Kangzang and Qingzang Highways are officially open to traffic simultaneously. This is another glorious achievement of the victorious Chinese people under the illumination of the general task of the nation, following many great achievements in the country's economic construction. It is a pioneering feat of the Chinese people in conquering nature and another great victory in our country's transportation construction.

    The full opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways has opened a transportation artery between the interior of the motherland and the Tibet region, which is of great significance for consolidating the unity between all ethnic groups and among the Tibetan people. It is of extremely great importance for promoting the economic and cultural development of the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups along the route.

    The Kangzang and Qingzang Highways are located on the plateau, where the air is thin, the population is sparse, and supplies are difficult. In addition, the lines pass through numerous high mountains, turbulent rivers, glaciers, quicksand, forests, swamps, and desert areas, making the project particularly difficult and arduous. However, all the commanders, fighters, and workers who participated in the road construction, under the wise leadership and close concern of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the direct guidance of the Southwest and Northwest Party, government, and military leading organs, with the enthusiastic and selfless assistance of Soviet experts, and with the support of the people from all over the country, especially the Tibetan people, you completed the task by overcoming all difficulties, conquering nature, with outstanding revolutionary heroic spirit and a high degree of patriotism, and many heroic figures emerged, many advanced experiences were created, and many inspiring heroic achievements were left behind.

    On the occasion of this opening ceremony, we pay tribute to the heroic model meritorious individuals! We express our gratitude to all commanders, fighters, workers, and laborers! We extend our condolences to the comrades who were injured or became ill due to overwork during the road construction, and we express our deep mourning to the martyrs who unfortunately sacrificed themselves during the road construction.

    Dear comrades! You have successfully completed the task of opening the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways. In the future, we hope that you will strengthen route maintenance, improve road conditions in a planned way, and improve route standards. Respond to the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and strive to consolidate the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and build the motherland!
