The State Council of the People's Republic of China
Instruction on the Issuance of 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds

    In order to accelerate national economic construction, gradually improve the people's material and cultural living standards, and promote people's savings, it is hereby decided to issue the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds. The regulations for these bonds have been submitted to the Third Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for approval and have been promulgated by the Chairman. The total amount of the bonds to be issued is RMB 6 trillion, and the issuance will begin in January 1955. In addition to the sales plan figures allocated to various regions, which will be notified separately by the Ministry of Finance, the following instructions are given regarding the relevant issues of bond sales:

    (1) Mobilizing the people of the whole country to contribute a portion of their surplus and potentially saved funds to subscribe to bonds in support of national construction is an important and regular method of raising the funds needed for socialist industrialization. The sales amount of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds greatly exceeded the plan. Through the bond sales work, the state not only concentrated a portion of the surplus and potentially saved funds in society to meet the needs of national construction, but also conducted a widespread education on patriotism and the overall tasks of our country during the transition period for the people of the whole country, further enhancing their concern and sense of responsibility for the country's socialist construction, and inspiring their enthusiasm in production and work. The people of our country have realized from practical life that subscribing to bonds not only has the nature of savings in economic terms, but is also a manifestation of patriotism in political terms. It can be expected that the people of the whole country will enthusiastically subscribe to the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds with even greater enthusiasm to support national construction.

    (2) Based on the current economic capacity of the people of all strata in our country, the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds are planned to be sold to the amount of 1.5 trillion yuan among workers and staff, of which 1.4 trillion yuan will be sold to workers, shop assistants, government agencies, organizations, and cultural and educational workers, and 100 billion yuan will be sold to cadres in the armed forces; 1.8 trillion yuan will be sold in rural areas; and 2.7 trillion yuan will be sold among urban private industrialists and businessmen (including shareholders and representatives of capitalists), the private sector of joint state-private enterprises, and other urban residents.

    Since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan for two years, China's industrial and agricultural production has continued to grow, especially industrial production has made great progress, the number of employed people has increased, people's living standards have gradually improved, and people's political awareness has greatly improved. The above-mentioned 1955 bond issuance figures can certainly be completed and even over-completed as long as the allocation is reasonable and the publicity and mobilization work for bond sales is done well.

    (3) The 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds stipulate that sales, subscriptions, and collections will begin in January 1955 and end in October. Interest on the bonds will be calculated from October 1, 1955. Those who make early payments will still be given encouragement and consideration through interest subsidies.

    (4) In bond sales, the principles of reasonable allocation, voluntariness, and affordability must be implemented. The sales methods are: (1) For employees of agencies, enterprises, organizations, schools, and cadres of the armed forces, the method of "one-time subscription, installment payment" will still be adopted, that is, after a one-time subscription, the unit where they are located will pay on their behalf in installments from their wages or allowances. Those who voluntarily pay at one time can also pay at one time. The subscription stage should be completed before the end of March 1955. In order to prevent some employees and cadres of the armed forces from subscribing too much, which may affect their daily life, it is stipulated that the amount of subscription per person should generally not exceed 50% of one month's salary or allowance. (2) In rural areas, the method of combining reasonable allocation and voluntary subscription will be adopted, that is, the sales figures will be reasonably allocated according to the economic conditions of rural areas in various regions, and farmers will subscribe voluntarily. Bond payments can generally be made by means of "pay as you subscribe." The specific arrangements for the timing of sales and payments shall be determined by the people's governments of the provinces and municipalities within the bond issuance period. (3) For private industrialists and businessmen, the private sector of joint state-private enterprises, and other urban residents, the method of one-time subscription followed by one-time payment or installment payment will still be adopted. The subscription stage should be completed before the end of March 1955. The bond payment time for industrial and commercial households should be properly arranged in conjunction with the time for collecting income tax in various places to take care of their convenience of payment.

    (5) The Ministry of Finance is responsible for handling the national bond sales work. In order to successfully complete the sales work, all localities must still organize bond sales committees at all levels in accordance with the regulations for the 1954 bond sales work, and the local people's government must designate a person to be responsible for it, and an office must be organized to handle the specific affairs of sales and supervision of bond collection. Bond sales committees at all levels must be responsible for completing all bond sales work and must not be revoked or weakened midway.

    (6) People's governments at all levels must attach importance to the leadership of this work. The key to doing a good job in bond sales is to carry out in-depth publicity and education work among the people, and based on the good reputation established among the people by the state's issuance of bonds in the past four years, repeatedly publicize the benefits of issuing bonds to the country and the people, and call on and mobilize the people to consciously and voluntarily subscribe and pay. All localities should carefully summarize and fully utilize the experience of the 1954 bond sales, promote advantages, correct shortcomings, and improve work. In the bond sales work, we must first pay attention to preventing and correcting the tendency of being satisfied with the achievements of over-fulfilling the bond sales work in 1954, relaxing leadership over the new bond sales work, neglecting publicity and education, and letting things take their course; at the same time, we must implement the spirit of democratic consultation, adhere to the principles of voluntariness and affordability, and must not force workers, farmers, public employees, cadres of the armed forces, and people from all walks of life who are unable to purchase bonds to purchase them, and resolutely prevent coercive orders. During the sales and organization of collections, attention should be paid to organizing relevant economic departments to closely cooperate in work according to market conditions to ensure the normal circulation of currency and prices.

    We believe that with the increasing development of national economic construction, the gradual rise of people's material and cultural living standards, and the universal improvement of people's political awareness, as long as the leaders at all levels attach importance to it and strengthen publicity and organizational work, the issuance of 1955 bonds should and can be done better than in 1954.

    中华人民共和国国务院
    关于发行一九五五年国家经济建设公债的指示
    为了加速国家经济建设，逐步提高人民物质和文化生活水平，并促进人民节约储蓄，兹决定发行一九五五年国家经济建设公债。此项公债条例已提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会第三次会议通过，并已由主席公布。公债发行总额为人民币六万亿元，定于一九五五年一月开始发行，除分配给各地区的推销计划数字另由财政部通知外，兹对推销公债的有关问题，作如下指示：
      （一）动员全国人民，拿出一部分多余的和可能节约的资金，认购公债，支援国家建设，是筹集社会主义工业化所需资金的重要的和经常的方法之一。一九五四年国家经济建设公债的推销数额，大大超过了计划。国家通过公债推销工作，不但集中了社会上的一部分多余的和可能节约的资金，供应了国家建设的需要；而且还对全国人民广泛地进行了一次爱国主义和我国在过渡时期的总任务的教育，进一步提高了他们对国家的社会主义建设的关怀和责任感，并鼓舞了他们在生产上和工作上的积极性。我国人民已经从实际生活中认识到，认购公债不仅在经济上具有储蓄的性质，而且在政治上也是一种爱国主义的表现。可以预期，一九五五年发行的国家经济建设公债，全国人民必将以更加热烈的心情，踊跃认购，以支援国家的建设。
      （二）根据我国目前各阶层人民的经济能力，一九五五年国家经济建设公债，预定在职工中推销一万五千亿元，其中向工人、店员、政府机关、团体和文化教育工作人员推销一万四千亿元，部队干部推销一千亿元；在农村中推销一万八千亿元；在城市私营工商业（包括股东和资方代理人）、公私合营企业的私方及其他城市居民中推销二万七千亿元。
    第一个五年建设计划执行两年以来，我国工农业生产不断增长，特别是工业生产有很大的发展，社会就业人员日益增多，人民生活逐步改善，人民的政治觉悟也大为提高，上述一九五五年公债发行数字，只要分配合理并做好公债推销的宣传动员工作，是一定能够完成，而且会超额完成的。
      （三）一九五五年国家经济建设公债，规定自一九五五年一月起开始推销、认购和收款，到十月底结束。并自一九五五年十月一日起，计算公债利息。其提前缴款者仍采用贴息办法给以鼓励和照顾。
    （四）在公债推销中，要贯彻合理分配、自愿、量力的原则。其推销方法：（1）对机关、企业、团体、学校的职工及部队干部，仍采取“一次认购、分期缴款”的方法，即一次认购后，由所在单位在其工资或津贴内分期代缴，自愿一次缴纳者亦可一次缴纳。认购阶段应于一九五五年三月底以前结束。为防止有些职工和部队干部认购过多，致影响日常生活，规定职工和部队干部每人认购数额一般以不超过一个月的工资或津贴费的百分之五十为限。（2）在农村中推销公债，采取合理分配与自愿认购相结合的方法，即按各个地区农村的经济情况，合理分配推销数字，由农民自愿认购。公债缴款一般可采取“随认购、随缴款”的方法。具体推销和缴款时间的安排，由各省、市人民政府在公债发行期限内自行确定。（3）对私营工商业、公私合营企业的私方及其他城市居民，仍采取一次认购后，一次缴清或分期缴纳的方法。认购阶段应于一九五五年三月底以前结束。对于工商业户的公债缴款时间，各地应与征收所得税的时间一并考虑作适当安排，以照顾其缴款的便利。
    （五）全国公债的推销工作，责成财政部负责办理。为了胜利完成推销工作，各地仍须按照一九五四年推销公债工作的规定，组织各级公债推销委员会，由当地人民政府指定专人负责，并须组织办公室，办理推销和督促公债收款的具体事务。各级公债推销委员会必须负责全部完成公债推销工作，不得中途撤销或削弱。
    （六）各级人民政府必须重视对这一工作的领导，做好推销公债工作的关键是向人民群众进行深入的宣传教育工作，依据四年来国家发行公债在人民中所树立的良好信誉，反复宣传发行公债对国家和人民的好处，号召和动员人民自觉自愿地踊跃认购和缴款。各地应当很好总结和充分运用一九五四年推销公债的经验，发扬优点，改正缺点，改进工作。在公债推销工作中，必须首先注意防止和纠正那种满足于一九五四年超额完成公债推销工作的成绩，而对新的公债推销工作放松领导，忽视宣传教育，放任自流等偏向的产生；同时必须贯彻民主协商的精神，坚持自愿、量力的原则，对无力购买公债的工人、农民、公教人员、部队干部和其他各界人民都不许强令购买，坚决防止强迫命令的做法。在推销和组织收款期间，要注意组织有关经济部门根据市场情况，在工作上密切配合，保证货币流通和物价的正常。
    我们相信，当国家经济建设日益发展、人民物质和文化生活水平逐步上升、人民政治觉悟普遍提高的情况下，只要各级领导重视，加强宣传和组织工作，一九五五年公债的发行是应该而且能够比一九五四年做得更好的。
    总理  周恩来
    一九五四年十二月二十一日
