The peaceful resolution of the Korean question cannot be delayed
Wu Quan

Under the current circumstances, it is urgently necessary for the relevant countries to re-engage in negotiations regarding the Korean question and resolve the peaceful reunification of Korea.

However, the recent United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the Korean question, succumbing to the will of the United States, passed the so-called Fifteen-Nation Proposal, allowing the United States to continue to threaten peace in Korea and the Far East under the banner of the United Nations.

In the interests of restoring Korean unity and guaranteeing peace, the Soviet delegation submitted a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly advocating that a conference of relevant countries be held in the near future to reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean question based on the establishment of a unified, independent, and democratic Korea. This proposal is a consistent demand put forward by the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China made this proposal in his government work report at the First National People's Congress in September, and the joint declaration issued by the Chinese and Soviet governments on October 12 also put forward this proposal. On October 28, Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also expressed full support for this in his report to the Eighth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly.

The United States and other invading countries in Korea groundlessly rejected the Soviet delegation's proposal and, ignoring the facts, stubbornly claimed that convening a conference of relevant countries to discuss the Korean question at the present time would be "of no use." This unreasonable attitude of the United States in refusing consultation was also blatantly manifested in their refusal to invite representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion. Everyone knows that without the participation of Korea and China, it is impossible to seriously discuss and resolve the Korean question. This attitude of the United States and its followers shows that they are eager to manipulate the United Nations to make unilateral decisions in order to block the path to a negotiated resolution of the Korean question.

The United States drafted and manipulated the United Nations General Assembly to pass the so-called Fifteen-Nation Proposal in order to force the United Nations to approve the report of the Geneva Conference's discussion of the Korean question proposed by the United States and its accomplices. This report completely distorts the facts, attempting to conceal the actions of the United States and its followers in undermining the Geneva Conference on the Korean question, and tries to shift the responsibility for the Geneva Conference's failure to reach an agreement on the Korean question onto China, the Soviet Union, and Korea. At the same time, this report not only fails to propose resuming negotiations on the Korean question, but also states that it is necessary to accept their unilaterally insisted upon, bankrupt so-called "basic principles" at the Geneva Conference, namely, that the United Nations, one of the belligerents, should supervise Korean elections to realize the sinister plot of the Syngman Rhee group to rule all of Korea and turn Korea into a colony of the United States. Isn't this the height of arrogance?

The Geneva Conference is not far in the past. Everyone still remembers who made sincere efforts for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question at the conference, and who stubbornly refused to negotiate and rudely interrupted the conference. This is something that the United States cannot distort. At the Geneva Conference, the United States even unreasonably rejected the final suggestions made separately by the delegations of China, the Soviet Union, and Korea to guarantee the peaceful state of Korea, not to take any actions that would threaten peace in Korea, and for all countries to continue their efforts to resume negotiations. Can this be concealed? After the Geneva Conference, the United States further intensified its policy of obstructing a resolution of the Korean question, opposing the free exchange and contact between the people of North and South Korea, instigating the Syngman Rhee group to plot the "dissolution" of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, continuously violating the Korean Armistice Agreement by shipping reinforcements of military supplies into South Korea, and allocating 450 million US dollars to expand the South Korean army. The Syngman Rhee group, relying on American bayonets and fearing the consolidation of peace in Korea, also incessantly clamored for "abolishing" the Korean Armistice Agreement and unifying Korea by force. Is this accidental?

It must be pointed out that the unreasonable attitude of the United States in obstructing the resumption of negotiations on the Korean question is linked to its actions in intensifying the creation of new war crises in the Far East and Europe. The United States is dragging some countries by the nose towards war. It has concluded an aggressive war treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to expand the military encirclement and provocative attacks against the People's Republic of China, and in Western Europe, it is attempting to revive German militaristic forces in the form of the Paris Agreements, making West Germany a hotbed for nurturing new wars. Precisely because of this, the peaceful resolution of the Korean question can no longer be delayed.

People have seen that in this United Nations discussion, the British representative abandoned the attitude that Britain had expressed on the Korean question after the Geneva Conference and completely acted as a servant to American policy. On June 23 of this year, British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the British House of Commons that "the suggestion of continuing negotiations" on the Korean question "remains valid" and emphasized that "the United Nations cannot expect to solve the Korean problem without the agreement of China and the two Koreas." However, the same British government representative, Nutting, publicly stated in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly that inviting representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People’s Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the Korean question "can hardly be said to be appropriate" and stubbornly claimed that "no further steps" could be taken on the Korean question at this time. This flip-flopping attitude of the British government representatives, and their recent support for the US-Chiang war treaty and their efforts to cover up and defend America's shameful espionage activities, are all encouragements to American aggressors. The result can only be to exacerbate the tense situation in the Far East and the world, which runs counter to Britain's own interests and the British people's desire for peace.

The perverse actions of the United States and its followers on the Korean question cannot but arouse the legitimate indignation and condemnation of countries with peaceful aspirations. In the United Nations debate, not only did the representatives of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries correctly expose the conspiratorial purpose of the so-called Fifteen-Nation Proposal, but representatives from countries such as India, Bolivia, and Syria also expressed dissatisfaction with the American attitude. The Indian representative believed that forcing the United Nations to pass the American Fifteen-Nation Proposal was "unwise" and demanded that the United States "not allow a situation to occur that would further deepen the Korean stalemate." The Bolivian representative also believed that the American attempt to expand the dark rule of South Korea to all of Korea as a "basic principle" for resolving the Korean question was "a wrong approach." The Syrian representative stated more directly that the Fifteen-Nation Proposal concocted by the United States "strangled" the idea of future negotiations and "would not produce any results." Representatives from many countries expressed hope in their speeches that the parties directly concerned would continue to hold negotiations and seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean question in a conciliatory manner. This desire cannot be ignored. The claim that the "conditions" for continuing negotiations on the Korean question are not yet "ripe" is obviously absurd.

What is currently obstructing the resolution of the Korean question is the unreasonable attitude of the United States. All those who sincerely desire a resolution of the Korean question should resolutely oppose the American policy of obstruction in order to eliminate the obstacles on the road to resolving the Korean question.

The Chinese people have consistently cared about the peace of Korea and the Korean people's cause of striving to restore national unity, and are determined to continue to fully support the just struggle of the Korean people to achieve the unification of the Korean nation and consolidate peace in Korea and Asia.

    朝鲜问题的和平解决不容拖延
    吴全
    在目前的情势下，有关国家就朝鲜问题重新进行谈判，解决朝鲜的和平统一问题，是迫切需要的。
    但是，最近联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题的结果，竟屈从美国的意志，通过了所谓十五国提案，使美国得以继续打着联合国的旗帜，威胁朝鲜及远东的和平。
    苏联代表团为了恢复朝鲜的统一和保证和平的利益，向联合国大会提出建议，主张在最近的将来举行一次有关国家的会议，以便达成协议，在建立一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题。这个建议，是中华人民共和国、苏联和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一再提出的主张。今年九月我国周恩来总理兼外长在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会会议上所作的政府工作报告，十月十二日中苏两国政府发表的联合宣言，都提出了这个主张。十月二十八日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国南日外务相在最高人民会议第八届会议上的报告，对此也表示完全支持。
    美国及其他侵朝国家毫无理由地拒绝了苏联代表团的建议，并不顾事实地硬说目前召开有关国家讨论朝鲜问题的会议是“没有任何用处的”。美国这种拒绝协商的无理态度，还露骨地表现在他们拒绝邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国派遣代表参加讨论这一点上面。谁都知道，没有朝、中两国的参加，要认真讨论和解决朝鲜问题是不可能的。美国及其追随者的这种态度，表明它们急于要操纵联合国作出片面决定，以堵塞协商解决朝鲜问题的道路。
    美国一手拟订并操纵联合国大会通过所谓十五国提案，就是为了要强使联合国批准美国及其帮凶们所提出的关于日内瓦会议对朝鲜问题的讨论的报告。这个报告完全歪曲事实，竭力掩盖美国及其追随者破坏日内瓦会议关于朝鲜问题会议的行为，企图把日内瓦会议未能就朝鲜问题达成协议的责任推到朝、中、苏三国的身上；同时，这个报告不仅根本没有提出恢复讨论朝鲜问题谈判的建议，而且竟然表示必须接受它们在日内瓦会议上片面坚持的、早就破了产的所谓“基本原则”，即由交战一方的联合国来监督朝鲜选举，以实现李承晚集团统治全朝鲜、把朝鲜作为美国殖民地的罪恶阴谋。这不是狂妄到了极点吗？
    日内瓦会议过去不远，谁在会议上为和平解决朝鲜问题作了真诚的努力，谁则一味拒绝协商，蛮横中断会议，大家记忆犹新，绝对不是美国所能歪曲的。美国在日内瓦会议上连朝、中、苏三国代表团最后分别提出的保证朝鲜的和平状态、不得采取任何威胁朝鲜和平的行动、各国继续努力恢复谈判等建议，也无理地加以拒绝，这难道是能够掩饰得了的吗？在日内瓦会议以后，美国更加紧执行阻挠朝鲜问题获得解决的政策，反对南北朝鲜人民自由来往建立联系，唆使李承晚集团阴谋“解散”中立国监察委员会，不断地违反朝鲜停战协定向南朝鲜运入增援性军事物资，并拨出四亿五千万美元扩充南朝鲜军队；而依附美国刺刀、唯恐朝鲜和平得以巩固的李承晚集团，也喋喋不休地叫嚣“废除”朝鲜停战协定，武力统一朝鲜。这难道是偶然的吗？
    必须指出，美国阻挠就朝鲜问题重开谈判的无理态度，是和它在远东和欧洲加紧制造新的战争危机的行为相联系着的。美国正在牵着一些国家的鼻子走向战争。它同蒋介石卖国集团缔结了侵略性的战争条约，力图扩大对中华人民共和国的军事包围和挑衅进攻，并在西欧企图用巴黎协定的形式重新复活德国军国主义势力，使西德成为孕育新战争的温床。正是因为这样，朝鲜问题的和平解决就更不容拖延下去了。
    人们看到，在这次联合国的讨论中，英国代表背弃了日内瓦会议之后英国在朝鲜问题上曾经表明的态度，而完全为美国的政策充当仆役了。今年六月二十三日，英国外交大臣艾登在英国下院的发言中，曾说关于朝鲜问题“继续举行谈判的建议仍然是有效的”，并且强调：“联合国不能指望在没有得到中国以及两个朝鲜同意下来解决朝鲜问题”。但是，同一个英国政府的代表纳丁，却在联合国大会政治委员会上公然说邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的代表参加朝鲜问题的讨论
  “很难说是适当的”，并且硬说目前在朝鲜问题上
  “不能采取任何进一步的步骤”。英国政府的代表们这种出尔反尔的态度，和他们最近支持美蒋战争条约、竭力为美国的可耻的间谍行为遮羞、辩护，都是对美国侵略者的怂恿，其结果，只能加剧远东和世界的紧张局势，而这是和英国自身的利益以及英国人民要求和平的愿望背道而驰的。
    美国和它的追随者在朝鲜问题上的倒行逆施，不能不引起怀有和平愿望的国家的正当的愤慨和谴责。在联合国的辩论中，不但苏联和人民民主国家的代表正确地揭露了所谓十五国提案的阴谋目的，他如印度、玻利维亚、叙利亚等国的代表也对美国的态度表示不满。印度代表认为强迫联合国通过美国的十五国提案是“不智的”，并且要求美国“不要让一种会使朝鲜的僵局进一步加深的局势发生”。玻利维亚代表也认为美国企图把南朝鲜的黑暗统治扩大到全朝鲜作为解决朝鲜问题的“基本原则”，是“一个错误的办法”。叙利亚的代表更直接了当地指出：美国炮制的十五国提案“扼杀”了将来举行谈判的念头，而且“不会产生任何成果”。许多国家的代表在发言中表示希望直接有关方面继续举行谈判，以和解的态度谋求和平解决朝鲜问题。这种愿望是不容忽视的。所谓就朝鲜问题继续举行谈判的“条件”目前还不“成熟”的说法，显然是无稽之谈。
    目前阻挠着朝鲜问题的解决的，就是美国的无理态度。一切对谋求朝鲜问题的解决怀有真诚愿望的人，都应当坚决反对美国的阻挠政策，以消除解决朝鲜问题道路上的障碍。
    中国人民一贯关心朝鲜的和平和朝鲜人民争取恢复国家统一的事业，并决心继续全力支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争，以实现朝鲜国家的统一，并巩固朝鲜和亚洲的和平。
