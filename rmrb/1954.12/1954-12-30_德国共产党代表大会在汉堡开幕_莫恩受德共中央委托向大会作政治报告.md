Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 29th: According to a report from the German News Agency in Hamburg: The German Communist Party Congress opened in Hamburg on the morning of the 28th. Eight hundred and fifty delegates from grassroots organizations of the German Communist Party in factories, mines, and industrial centers across West Germany attended the congress.

    This congress is being held at a crucial stage in the German people's struggle against the remilitarization of West Germany. Due to the fascist and anti-democratic policies adopted by the Adenauer government, some delegates were imprisoned or faced the threat of arrest and were unable to attend the congress. Leaders of the Central Committee Secretariat, such as Lehmann, Fischer, Ledwin, Noman, and Reschke, did not attend the congress. The entire assembly expressed their special and heartfelt greetings to them and elected them as honorary presidium members.

    A delegation from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, composed of Materne, Florin, and Rosa Thälmann, attended the congress. Representatives from the Communist Parties of Italy, Britain, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, and the Swiss Labor Party also attended the congress, and representatives from the Communist Parties of France and Finland were on their way.

    The congress elected the presidium. Prominent activists of the German Communist Party, representatives of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and representatives of fraternal Communist parties were elected to the presidium.

    Willi Mohn, Secretary of the Central Committee Secretariat of the German Communist Party, delivered the opening address. He pointed out: This congress is being held under the circumstances that the Adenauer government is striving to revive the West German "Bundeswehr" through the shameful Paris Agreements and is banning the German Communist Party, which is leading the masses in opposing the aforementioned policies. However, the German people desire peace and the unification of Germany. He said: It is necessary to further strengthen the German Communist Party's ties with the masses. The current task is to continue to advance by raising the banner of democratic freedom, which has been abandoned by the bourgeoisie.

    The first item on the agenda was Mohn delivering a political report to the congress, entrusted by the Central Committee of the German Communist Party.

    Mohn first pointed out that the task of the congress is to examine the new situation and to determine the party's guidelines for opposing the revival of German militarism and striving for the peaceful unification of the fatherland in the coming period.

    He pointed out: After the bankruptcy of the "European Defense Community," the new attempt to revive West German militarism—the Paris Agreements—means preventing the peaceful unification of Germany and poses a direct threat to the German people and the people of Europe. The Paris Agreements will lead the Adenauer government down the path of military dictatorship, which is to say, the path of oppression of the working class and the destruction of democratic forces. Due to the signing of the Paris Agreements and the Adenauer government's rejection of more than fifty proposals from the German Democratic Republic regarding reaching an all-German understanding, the situation today demands more urgently than ever that the Germans in the East and West extend their brotherly hands and finally realize the patriotic demand: Germans sit down at one table!

    Mohn pointed out that the movement of the West German people against militarization is growing. Every state election held in West Germany since September 1953 has proven that the people are against the policies of militarists and revanchists represented by the Christian Democratic Union. Mohn said that West German militarists have already prepared a reserve source for the West German Bundeswehr by establishing "traditional associations," "service teams," and "police legions," etc. At the same time, today's West German monopoly capitalists and big bankers are more concentrated than they were during the Hitler regime. Just as after the First World War, today, West German militarism is preparing for a new war under the guise of a "defensive" army. Adenauer is attacking the democratic rights of the West German people to suppress their resistance to militarization. The Adenauer government's trial of the German Communist Party in violation of the law and human rights is the biggest threat to West Germany's path toward military dictatorship. However, the German Communist Party must resolutely repel the Adenauer government's attack on the German Communist Party and firmly consolidate itself.

    德国共产党代表大会在汉堡开幕
    莫恩受德共中央委托向大会作政治报告
    【新华社柏林二十九日电】　据德意志通讯社汉堡讯：德国共产党代表大会二十八日上午在汉堡开幕。出席大会的有德国共产党在西德各地厂矿和工业中心的基层组织的代表八百五十人。
    这次大会是在德国人民反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争处在一个重要阶段的时候召开的。由于阿登纳政府所采取的法西斯和反民主的政策，有一部分代表被关在监狱里，或者遭到被逮捕的威胁，因而不能出席大会。党中央委员会书记处的领导人雷曼、费希、莱德温、诺曼、雷熙等都没有出席大会，全场对他们特别致亲切的慰问，并且选举他们为名誉主席团。
    由马特恩、佛罗利希和罗萨·台尔曼所组成的德国统一社会党代表团出席了大会。意大利、英国、瑞典、丹麦、荷兰、奥地利的共产党和瑞士劳动党的代表也出席了大会，法国和芬兰共产党的代表正在途中。
    代表大会选出了主席团。德国共产党的杰出的活动家、德国统一社会党的代表和兄弟共产党的代表被选入了主席团。
    德国共产党中央委员会书记处书记维利·莫恩致开幕词。他指出：这次代表大会是在这样的情况下举行的：阿登纳政府正在力图通过可耻的巴黎协定，力图复活西德“国防军”和禁止正在领导群众反对上述政策的德国共产党。但是，德国人民希望的是和平和德国的统一。他说：必须进一步加强德国共产党同群众的联系。现在的任务是：举起已经被资产阶级抛弃了的民主自由的旗帜继续前进。
    会议的首项议程是：莫恩受德共中央的委托向代表大会作政治报告。
    莫恩首先指出：代表大会的任务是：审查新的形势，并且规定党在今后时期中反对复活德国军国主义和争取祖国的和平统一的方针。
    他指出：在“欧洲防务集团”破产以后，复活西德军国主义的新的尝试——巴黎协定意味着阻止德国的和平统一和对德国人民和欧洲各国人民的直接威胁。巴黎协定会使阿登纳政府走上军事独裁的道路，也就是工人阶级受压迫和民主力量受摧残的道路。由于巴黎协定的签字和阿登纳政府拒绝了德意志民主共和国所提出的五十次以上的关于达成全德谅解的建议所造成的形势，今天比以往任何时候都更加迫切地要求东部和西部的德国人伸出兄弟的手，并且最后实现爱国主义的要求：德国人坐到一张桌子上来！
    莫恩指出：西德人民反对军国主义化的运动日益发展。自从一九五三年九月以来在西德所举行的每一次州选举都证明：人民是反对以基督教民主联盟为代表的军国主义者和复仇主义者的政策的。莫恩说：由于建立了“传统协会”、“服务队”和“警察团”等，西德军国主义者已经准备了西德国防军的后备来源。同时，今天西德的垄断资本家和大银行家比希特勒统治时代更加集中了。正如第一次大战以后一样，今天，西德军国主义正在一个“防御性”军队的掩盖下准备着新的战争。阿登纳正在进攻西德人民的民主权利以镇压西德人民反对军国主义化的抵抗行动。阿登纳政府违反法律、违反人权对德国共产党进行的审讯乃是西德走上军事独裁道路的最大威胁。但是，德国共产党一定要坚决地击退阿登纳政府对德国共产党的进攻，并且坚定地巩固自己。
