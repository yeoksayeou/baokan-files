Heilongjiang Province Cooperative Union recently sent a working group to investigate the purchasing power of farmers after the great development of agricultural producers' cooperatives in four typical villages. The investigation results proved that farmers who implement unified management and collective production have more funds and can do things that individual farmers cannot. They need complete sets of, diverse, and high-quality means of production. The nine agricultural producers' cooperatives surveyed, which varied in size, age, and establishment date, will purchase many new and improved farm tools next year. Their need for wooden plows, plowshares, and small farm tools used by general individual farmers has decreased. These agricultural producers' cooperatives also have significant changes in their requirements for draught animals. They are now "discarding the inferior for the superior, exchanging oxen for horses, and exchanging weak horses for strong horses." The three older cooperatives alone will buy twenty-six strong horses. Newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives, because they have begun to implement collective production and can rationally use farm tools, need to add fewer old farm tools. Larger agricultural producers' cooperatives can divide labor and specialize, and more women participate in production, increasing the variety of means of production needed compared to the past, and they require adding them in batches. With the great development of the rural cooperativization movement, more and more farmers are adding or building houses. Agricultural producers' cooperatives need to build stables, farm tool storage, etc., requiring a lot of timber. Three agricultural producers' cooperatives alone will build twenty-four new houses in the spring of next year, requiring sixty-two cubic meters of timber. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Heilongjiang Province are adjusting their supply of means of agricultural production based on this new situation.

    黑龙江农民购买力提高
    黑龙江省合作社联合社最近派出工作组在四个典型村调查农业生产合作社大发展后的农民购买力情况。调查结果证明：实行统一经营集体生产的农民，有较多的资金，能办到个体农民所办不了的事情。他们需要成套的、品种多样的、质量较好的生产资料。调查的九个大、小、新、老不同的农业生产合作社，明年要添购许多新式农具和改良农具。他们对木犁、铧子和一般个体农民使用的小农具的需要减少了。这些农业生产合作社对耕畜要求也有很大变化，他们现在是“甩次的换好的，以牛换马，以弱马换强马”，仅其中的三个老社就要买强马二十六匹。新建的农业生产合作社由于开始实行集体生产，能够合理使用农具，需要增添旧农具较少。较大的农业生产合作社能分工分业，妇女参加生产也较多，需要生产资料的品种比往常增加了，并且要求成批增添。随着农村合作化运动的大发展，农民添盖房屋的增多了，农业生产合作社要建造马棚、农具库等，需要许多木材，仅三个农业生产合作社在明年春季就要建新房二十四间，需要木材六十二立方公尺。黑龙江省各地供销合作社正根据这种新的情况，着手改进对农村生产资料的供应工作。　　　　（新华社）
