    Chongqing People From All Walks of Life Warmly Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Statement
    The people of Chongqing from all walks of life warmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." Tang Ruifu, special-class model worker of the 102 Steel Plant, said: "We resolutely oppose the U.S.-Chiang treaty. The four steelmaking workshops of our three steel plants are now engaged in inter-trade competitions. We will definitely produce more and better steel to support the liberation of Taiwan." Dai Xizhi, director of the Xingfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shimahe Township, a suburb of the city, said: "In addition to working hard to increase the production of grain and vegetables, we must also do a good job in publicizing the Compulsory Military Service System and mobilize the vast number of young people to serve in the military to liberate Taiwan." Ding Daoheng, professor of the Department of Geology at Chongqing University, said: "Foreign Minister Zhou's statement represents the will of the people of the whole country. In the future, I will not only do my job well, but also widely expose the conspiracies of the American aggressors." Hu Ziang, chairman of the Chongqing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "We express extreme indignation at the U.S.-Chiang treaty. The city's industrial and commercial circles must respond to Foreign Minister Zhou's call with practical actions of patriotism, law-abiding behavior, active business operations and production, and enthusiastic payment of national taxes, to smash any war threats and intimidations by aggressors."
