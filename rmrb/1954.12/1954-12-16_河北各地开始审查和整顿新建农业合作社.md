Hebei Begins Reviewing and Rectifying Newly Established Agricultural Cooperatives

[Report from this newspaper] Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives in Hebei Province have grown to over 90,000, with member households accounting for more than a quarter of the province's total farm households. In Raoyang, Xingtai, Laiyuan, Zunhua, and 16 other counties with a solid foundation in mutual aid and cooperation, member households have reached over 50% of the total farm households.

Although this year's cooperative establishment work in Hebei Province has achieved great success, due to the rapid progress of the movement, some counties were poorly prepared, ideological mobilization was insufficient, and some county and district leaders had a tendency to pursue quantity over quality. Consequently, some cooperatives lacked sufficient conditions and were not consolidated, with individual places experiencing disintegration, collapse, and member withdrawals. In light of the above situation, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has instructed local (city) and county committees to shift the focus of their leadership in the agricultural cooperativization movement from development to consolidation. They are also instructed to carry out the rectification of new cooperatives in a planned way in conjunction with the current unified purchase and sale of grain. In particular, large cooperatives with more than 100 households should be reviewed and rectified one by one. For cooperatives with poor foundations, weak core members, and lacking conditions for success, the masses should be patiently persuaded to appropriately reduce their size or divide them into several cooperatives. At present, various localities are following the spirit of the Provincial Committee's instructions, addressing the problems existing within the cooperatives to carry out rectification. After the rectification of 41 new cooperatives in Hejian County, 14 cooperatives strengthened their leadership, 13 cooperatives re-elected their cooperative cadres, 11 cooperatives established production plans, and 3 cooperatives merged with other cooperatives due to weak core members.

    河北各地开始审查和整顿新建农业合作社
    【本报讯】河北省农业生产合作社已发展到九万多个，入社农户达到全省总农户的四分之一以上。互助合作运动基础较好的饶阳、邢台、涞源、遵化等二十个县，入社农户已占总农户的百分之五十以上。
    河北省今年的建社工作，虽有很大成绩，但由于运动进展迅速，某些县份准备工作较差，思想发动不够充分，以及有的县、区领导上存有贪多贪大的情绪，因而有些社条件不足，不够巩固，个别地方已出现了涣散垮台和发生社员退社的现象。根据以上情况，中共河北省委已指示各地（市）、县委把领导农业合作化运动的工作重点由发展转到巩固方面来，并结合当前粮食统购统销有计划地进行新社的整顿工作，特别是对于一百户以上的大社要逐个进行审查和整顿，对于基础差、骨干弱、没有条件办好的社，就要耐心说服教育群众适当划小或分成几个社。目前，各地正按照省委指示精神，针对社内存在问题加以整顿。河间县经过整顿的四十一个新社，有十四个社充实了领导力量，十三个社改选了社干部，十一个社订好了生产计划，三个社因骨干过弱同别的社合并。
