    Rehe Province is building and expanding five state-owned grain farms. Among them, the three newly built farms have more than 100,000 mu of arable land. The largest, Yuer Mountain Farm, has more than 60,000 mu of arable land and will be fully mechanized, making it the first fully mechanized farm in Rehe Province. The other two farms will temporarily use new-style animal-drawn farm implements for cultivation. The construction of all three farms will be completed around 1957. At present, the soil survey work of each farm has been preliminarily completed, some farm buildings have been built, some machinery and farm implements have been transported, and more than 2,600 mu of virgin land have been opened up before the ground froze. According to the principle of "building the farm and producing at the same time," these three farms plan to reclaim more than 4,000 mu of wasteland before the spring plowing next year and plant all wheat, rapeseed, and rice according to national needs. It is estimated that 120 tons of wheat, 54 tons of rapeseed, and 170 tons of rice can be produced next year.
    The two expanded farms are Datan Farm and Huadoushen Paddy Field Farm. These two farms plan to expand the cultivated area by another 11,000 mu within three years and add some new-style animal-drawn farm implements. After the autumn harvest, the two farms have already started reclaiming wasteland, and 1,000 mu can be reclaimed before the spring plowing next year, preparing to plant rapeseed and rice.

    热河新建扩建五个谷物农场
    热河省正在新建和扩建五个国营谷物农场。其中新建的三个农场共拥有可耕地十万多亩。规模最大的鱼儿山农场拥有可耕地六万多亩，将全部实行机械作业，是热河省第一个完全机械化的农场。另外两个农场将暂时使用新式畜力农具耕作。这三个农场的全部建场工作，将在一九五七年前后结束。目前，各场都已初步完成了土壤勘测工作，修造了部分场房，运到了部分机械和农具，并在上冻前开了二千六百多亩生荒。根据“边建场、边生产”的方针，这三个农场计划到明年春耕前先开荒四千多亩，依照国家需要，全部播种小麦、油菜籽和水稻，估计明年可生产一百二十吨小麦、五十四吨油菜籽和一百七十吨水稻。
    扩建的两个农场是大滩农场和花都什稻田农场。这两个农场计划在三年内再扩大耕地面积一万一千亩，增加一部分新式畜力农具。秋收后两个农场就已开始开荒，到明年春耕前可开垦出一千亩，准备播种油菜籽和水稻。　　　　　　　（新华社）
