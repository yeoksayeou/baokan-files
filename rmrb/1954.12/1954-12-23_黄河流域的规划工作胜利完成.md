The planning work of the Yellow River Basin has been successfully completed. The geological exploration and surveying work for the Sanmenxia Reservoir, the largest hydraulic hub in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, is being actively carried out.

The Yellow River Planning Commission, in its "Technical and Economic Report on Comprehensive Utilization of the Yellow River," has proposed solutions to the following problems: First, effectively solve the flood control problem in the lower reaches of the Yellow River; second, rationally solve the land irrigation problem in the basin; third, solve the power supply problem for newly built and planned industrial bases in the basin; fourth, vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work in the loess area of ​​Northwest China, prevent soil erosion, and further develop agricultural production in the Northwest; fifth, develop the navigation of the Yellow River.

The report also proposed the first phase of engineering goals based on China's current urgent needs and possibilities. Among the more important ones are the two major hydraulic hubs of Sanmenxia (east of Shanxian County, Henan) and Liujiaxia (west of Lanzhou, Gansu). The Sanmenxia hydraulic hub is the key to harnessing and developing the Yellow River. After the reservoir is completed, it can basically solve the serious threat of flooding from the Yellow River; the vast farmland in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces will be irrigated; using hydropower generation can provide sufficient power supply for the industrial and agricultural production of the above three provinces; and downstream navigation will be developed. The geology of the Sanmenxia hydraulic hub is hard igneous rock, which is a good foundation for high dams; the terrain is excellent, the engineering structure is simple, and it can be completed in a relatively short period of time. The Liujiaxia hydraulic hub is one of the main projects above Hekou Town on the Yellow River. After the completion of this hydraulic hub, not only will the industry in Lanzhou area be fully supplied with electricity, but also the threat of Yellow River floods to Lanzhou will be eliminated, the vast irrigation areas of the original Ningxia and Houtao will be developed, and navigation from Yinchuan to Qingshuihe will be guaranteed. The report pointed out that after the completion of the first phase of irrigation projects on the Yellow River, 50% of the total water volume in the entire basin will be used for irrigation, and the new irrigation area will be doubled compared to the existing irrigation area. After the completion of the long-term plan, the irrigation area will be increased to eight times the existing irrigation area, and in fact, the existing water volume of the Yellow River will be fully utilized. The report believes that soil and water conservation work should also be actively carried out while constructing the first phase of the project.

The planning work of the Yellow River Basin was carried out under the direct guidance of the Soviet expert group. The "Technical and Economic Report on Comprehensive Utilization of the Yellow River" was also compiled starting in February this year. Soviet experts, responsible comrades from relevant ministries in China, and Chinese experts formed the Yellow River Survey Team, conducted on-site surveys in key areas of the Yellow River Basin, solved many principal problems regarding the planning work on the spot, and listened to the opinions and hopes of responsible comrades from various provinces and regions regarding the Yellow River planning work, collecting more supplementary information for the planning work. In the planning work, the Yellow River Planning Commission received frequent assistance from the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Railways, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences; many agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy cadres from Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also actively participated in this work, assisting in the smooth completion of this work.

    黄河流域的规划工作胜利完成
    【本报讯】黄河流域的规划工作已经胜利完成。黄河中游最大水力枢纽三门峡水库的地质探验和测量工作正积极进行。
    黄河规划委员会在“黄河综合利用技术经济报告”中，提出了解决以下几个问题的方案：第一，有效地解决黄河下游的防洪问题；第二，合理地解决流域内的土地灌溉问题；第三，解决流域内新建和拟建各工业基地的电力供应问题；第四，大力开展西北黄土区的水土保持工作，制止水土流失，进一步发展西北地区的农业生产；第五，发展黄河的航运问题。
    报告并根据我国目前迫切需要和可能，提出了第一期工程目标。其中比较重要的，是三门峡（河南陕县以东）和刘家峡（甘肃兰州以西）两大水力枢纽。三门峡水力枢纽是治理和开发黄河的关键，水库建成后，就可基本解决黄河严重的水灾威胁；河北、山东、河南三省广大农田将得到灌溉；利用水力发电，可使以上三省的工农业生产得到充分的电力供应；下游航运将得到发展。三门峡水力枢纽地质为坚硬的火成岩，是良好的高坝基础；地势优良，工程结构单纯，可在较短时期内建成。刘家峡水力枢纽，为黄河河口镇以上主要工程之一。这一水力枢纽完成后，不但兰州一带工业将得到充分电力供应，同时还可免除黄河洪水对兰州的威胁，使原宁夏和后套广大灌溉区得到发展，银川至清水河一段航运得到保证。报告中指出，黄河第一期灌溉工程完成后，全流域将有百分之五十的水量是用于灌溉，新的灌溉区将增加到现有灌溉面积的两倍。远景计划完成后，灌溉面积将增加到现有灌溉面积的八倍，实际上黄河的现有水量，将全部被利用。报告中认为，在兴建第一期工程同时，对水土保持工作也应积极进行。
    黄河流域的规划工作，是在苏联专家组直接指导下进行的。“黄河综合利用技术经济报告”也在今年二月开始编制。苏联专家、我国有关各部负责同志，和我国专家组成了黄河查勘团，在黄河流域的各重点地区进行实地查勘，就地解决了关于规划工作上的许多原则问题，并听取了各省区有关负责同志对于黄河规划工作的意见和希望，为规划工作搜集了更多的补充资料。黄河规划委员会在规划工作中，得到了水利部、燃料工业部、农业部、林业部、交通部、地质部、铁道部和中国科学院等部门的经常帮助；甘肃、陕西、山西、河南、河北、山东等省和内蒙古自治区的许多农、林、水利干部，也积极参加了这项工作，协助了这一工作的顺利完成。
