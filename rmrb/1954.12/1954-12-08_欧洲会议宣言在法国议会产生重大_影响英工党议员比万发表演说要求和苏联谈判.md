Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: Paris dispatch: The French Parliament is scheduled to begin debating the issue of ratifying the Paris Agreements on the 20th. At this time, the joint declaration issued by the European National Conference is a topic of heated discussion among members of the French Parliament.

A few days ago, French Prime Minister Mendès France spoke to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly, reiterating the old tune that ratifying the Paris Agreements would not undermine the basis for negotiations on the German question and other outstanding European affairs. However, after the publication of the joint declaration, it became clearer that ratifying the Paris Agreements is a major obstacle to ensuring peace in Europe. Some parliamentarians have had to reconsider their positions, some of whom not long ago were "in principle" in favor of the London Agreements and voted in favor of them in Parliament.

Soviet "Pravda" reporter Lasagin pointed out in a dispatch from Paris that the call in the French Parliament for postponing the ratification of the Paris Agreements and starting negotiations with the Soviet Union is growing louder and louder. An article written by former Prime Minister Édouard Daladier (Radical Socialist Party member) published in the French local newspaper "Dauphiné Libéré" is a typical illustration of the mood of certain bourgeois figures in the French Parliament today. Daladier voted to trust the government in October when the French Parliament held a vote of confidence in the government on the London Agreements, but now opposes West German re-militarization and advocates negotiations with the East before ratifying the Paris Agreements. Daladier emphasized that the current international situation shows that arming West Germany is incorrect.

Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: TASS London, December 6th: British Labour MP Bevan gave a speech in his constituency of Ebbw Vale, Monmouthshire, on the 5th, demanding negotiations with the Soviet Union before rearming West Germany.

Bevan pointed out that the Social Democrats and trade unionists in West Germany are saying: "Don't arm us." Bevan said he believed he was expressing the opinion of the majority of the British people.

    欧洲会议宣言在法国议会产生重大影响
    英工党议员比万发表演说要求和苏联谈判
    【新华社六日讯】巴黎消息：法国议会已定二十日开始辩论关于批准巴黎协定的问题，在这个时候，欧洲国家会议发表的联合宣言却是法国议会人士热烈谈论的一个主题。
    几天前，法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯在法国国民议会外交委员会上发言，还重弹旧调，硬说批准巴黎协定不会破坏就德国问题以及其他悬而未决的欧洲事务进行谈判的基础。但是，联合宣言发表之后，大家就更明白地看到了：批准巴黎协定是保障欧洲和平的主要障碍。一些议员不得不重新考虑自己的立场，这些议员不久以前还是“原则上”拥护伦敦协定并且在议会中投票赞成这个协定的。
    苏联“真理报”记者拉萨金在他发自巴黎的一篇通讯中指出：法国议会中要求延期批准巴黎协定而开始和苏联谈判的呼声越来越高了。法国地方报纸“多菲奈自由报”发表的前总理爱德华·达拉第
  （激进社会党议员）写的一篇文章就典型地说明了现在法国议会中某些资产阶级人士的情绪。达拉第在十月间法国议会就伦敦协定举行信任政府投票的时候，曾经投票信任政府，而现在则反对西德重新军国主义化，并且主张在批准巴黎协定以前同东方进行谈判。达拉第着重指出：目前的国际局势说明武装西德是不正确的。
      【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦六日讯：英国工党议员比万五日在他的选区蒙穆斯郡伊苞谷城发表演说，要求在重新武装西德以前和苏联进行谈判。
    比万指出，西德的社会党人和工会人士都在说：“不要武装我们”。比万说，他认为他所表达的是大多数英国人民的意见。
