Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 15th: Chinese Communist Party organizations in rural Gansu Province are growing stronger day by day. This year, over 3,400 advanced farmers of various ethnic groups have joined the Communist Party. Currently, there are 3,938 rural branches in the province, with branches established in 70.54% of all agricultural townships in the province.

The continuous consolidation and development of the Party's grassroots organizations in rural Gansu has made them the core force in leading rural mutual aid and cooperation and striving for increased agricultural production. According to surveys from seven special districts and one city, there are more than 16,200 Party members in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, of whom 212 serve as chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives and more than 6,500 serve as leaders of mutual aid teams. Under the specific leadership of the branches and the guidance of Party members, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the province has increased from 338 before the spring plowing this year to 773, and the number of mutual aid teams has increased from more than 194,400 last year to more than 245,300. Under the leadership of the branch, farmers in Nanhe Township, Yongning County, applied seed dressing with pesticides and rational close planting to more than 90% of wheat fields this year. As a result, although the township suffered a severe drought this year, the average grain yield was still 4% higher than the bumper harvest in 1952. In Tuofeng Township, Gangu County, the 16 mutual aid teams with the participation and leadership of Party members achieved high yields of summer and autumn grain crops this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Ya'an, 15th: In the Han areas of Xikang Province, many farmers have raised their awareness during the unified grain purchase process and are enthusiastically joining the Chinese Communist Party. According to preliminary statistics from Ya'an and Xichang Special Districts, 1,169 people joined the Communist Party by the end of November; the number of townships with established Party branches has increased from 86% to 90%.

The newly admitted Party members are all people with socialist consciousness. They enthusiastically sell surplus grain to the state and actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Yu Zhaohong, director of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaokang Township, Ya'an City, took the lead in selling more than 2,700 catties of surplus grain and motivated 14 farmers in the cooperative to overfulfill the grain sales task. When joining the Party, he stated that he would wholeheartedly work for socialist causes. Among the 472 new Party members in Huili, Mianning, Yanbian, Xichang, and other six counties, 97 were leading members of agricultural production cooperatives, and 154 were leaders of mutual aid teams. Due to the development of Party organizations, the number of agricultural production cooperatives with Party members has increased. Among the 146 agricultural production cooperatives in Huili and Xichang counties, 128 cooperatives have Communist Party members.

    甘肃农村党组织成为领导生产的核心力量
    西康汉族地区许多农民踊跃参加共产党
    【新华社兰州十五日电】甘肃省农村中的中国共产党组织正日益壮大。今年内加入共产党的各族农民中的先进分子已有三千四百多人。目前，全省有农村支部三千九百三十八个，建立支部的乡占全省农业乡总数的百分之七十点五四。
    甘肃省农村中党的基层组织不断巩固和发展，已成为领导农村互助合作和争取农业增产的核心力量。据七个专区和一个市的调查，在互助合作组织中有一万六千二百多个党员，其中二百一十二人担任着农业生产合作社的社长，六千五百多人担任着互助组的组长。在支部的具体领导和党员的带领下，目前全省的农业生产合作社已由今年春耕前的三百三十八个发展到七百七十三个，互助组已由去年的十九万四千四百多个增加到二十四万五千三百多个。永宁县南和乡农民在支部领导下，今年百分之九十以上的麦田都实行了药剂拌种和合理密植，因此这个乡今年虽然遭受严重旱灾，但粮食平均产量仍比一九五二年丰收产量高出百分之四。甘谷县驼峰乡由党员参加并领导的十六个互助组，今年夏秋粮食作物都获得高额产量。
    【新华社雅安十五日电】西康省汉族地区许多农民在粮食统购过程中提高了觉悟，踊跃参加中国共产党。据雅安、西昌两专区初步统计，到十一月底有一千一百六十九人加入了共产党；建立党支部的乡已由百分之八十六增加到百分之九十。
    被接收的新党员都是具有社会主义觉悟的人，他们踊跃地把余粮出售给国家，积极参加互助合作运动。雅安市孝康乡红星农业生产合作社主任余朝洪，带头卖余粮两千七百多斤，并带动全社十四户农民超额完成了售粮任务。他在入党时表示：要一心一意办好社会主义的事情。会理、冕宁、盐边、西昌等六县的四百七十二个新党员中，有九十七人是农业生产合作社的领导骨干，有一百五十四人是互助组长。由于党组织的发展，有党员的农业生产合作社增多了。会理、西昌两县一百四十六个农业生产合作社中有一百二十八个社里有了共产党员。
