    One hundred and fifteen cadres and model agricultural laborers from the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province, who had visited the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition in Beijing, have already applied their understanding of the Soviet Union's advanced agricultural production experiences to the practical work of improving agricultural production. Members of the Xigou Township Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, based on the advanced Soviet agricultural production experiences that Li Shunda and Shen Jilan saw at the exhibition, conducted a comparative examination of the cooperative's agricultural, forestry and animal husbandry production work. During the examination, it was discovered that in previous years, due to a lack of attention to fertilization techniques, the fertilizer applied to the fields in conjunction with autumn plowing lost much of its effectiveness after being exposed to wind and sun throughout the winter. This year, the cooperative members immediately changed this practice, storing the more than 2,000 dan of fertilizer collected in the autumn in earthen pits covered with soil, and then applying it to the fields in the spring in conjunction with shallow plowing, to fully utilize the fertilizer's effectiveness. At the same time, the cooperative members also ensiled more than 40,000 jin of corn stalks to be used as winter feed for sheep; and wrapped more than 500 grape and apple trees with dry grass and applied topdressing fertilizer to protect the fruit trees during the winter.
    After hearing the introduction by Jin Zijun, a representative who visited the exhibition, the members of the Changzhi China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm unanimously expressed their desire to learn from Soviet farmers, work hard to improve their skills, and increase grain production. Currently, the farm members are launching a winter fertilizer accumulation campaign, accumulating 300,000 dan of fertilizer in just fifteen days. Four hundred and forty-six young men and women farm members have also actively signed up to participate in amateur cultural and technical studies, determined to rapidly improve their cultural knowledge and agricultural science and technology levels in two or three years. They also plan to gradually promote the Soviet Maltsev's advanced cultivation methods on the farm's more than 17,000 mu of land, starting next year; and also to breed dairy cows in large numbers and develop rabbit and chicken farming, to increase the income of the farm members.
    Zhang Huaiyun, the director of the Lu'an County Farm, personally saw at the exhibition the Gold Queen corn pollinated by artificial pollination, with large, plump grains, yielding an average increase of more than 70 percent, and the practical examples of alkaline land reclaimed using advanced methods such as deep plowing, planting pasture, and green manure crops, and obtaining bumper harvests. He gained a lot of inspiration and incorporated these advanced experiences into the technical measures to ensure the realization of next year's production plan. At the same time, he also sent technical personnel to help the masses on 50,000 mu of alkaline land to start soil improvement experiments. In addition, referring to the advanced experience of Soviet state-owned farms with low investment and high income, he started to improve business management, reduce production investment, and strive to hand over more profits to the state next year.

    学习苏联的农业生产经验
    曾经在北京参观过苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的山西省长治专区的一百一十五名干部和农业劳动模范，已经把他们对于苏联先进农业生产经验的体会，运用到改进农业生产的实际工作中去。平顺县西沟乡农林畜牧生产合作社社员们，根据李顺达、申纪兰在展览会上看到的苏联先进农业生产经验，对照检查了全社农林畜牧生产工作。检查中，发现往年因不讲究施肥技术，结合秋耕施入地内的啨肥，经过一冬的风吹日晒，肥效散失很大；今年社员们立即改变了这种做法，把秋季积下的二千多担啨肥，先存放在土坑内用土盖好，明年结合春季浅耕，再施入地里，以充分发挥肥料的效用。同时，社员们还把四万多斤玉米秸青贮起来，给羊做冬季饲料；把五百多株葡萄、苹果等树用干草包好，并施了追肥，保护果树安全过冬。
    长治中苏友好集体农庄庄员们，听到参观代表晋子俊的介绍后，一致表示要好好向苏联农民学习，努力提高技术，增产粮食。目前，庄员们正展开冬季积肥竞赛，仅在十五天中，就积下肥料三十万担。四百四十六个青年男女庄员还积极报名参加了业余文化、技术学习，决心在二、三年内，把自己的文化知识和农业科学技术水平迅速提高一步。并计划从明年开始，在全庄一万七千多亩土地上，逐年推广苏联马尔采夫先进耕作方法；还要大量繁殖奶牛和发展养兔、养鸡事业，以增加庄员的收入。
    潞安县农场场长张怀云亲眼看到展览会上陈列着经过人工授粉的金皇后玉米，颗粒肥大饱满，平均增产百分之七十以上和采用深耕、种植牧草、绿肥作物等先进方法改良的碱地，获得丰收的实际事例，得到很多启示，并将这些先进经验列入保证明年生产计划实现的技术措施中。同时，还派出了技术人员帮助群众在五万亩碱地上，着手进行土壤改良试验。此外，他还参照苏联国营农场投资少、收入多的先进经验，着手改善经营管理，降低生产投资，争取明年有更多的利润上缴给国家。
