Fujian Province's 289,000 mu of sugarcane have begun to be harvested, with an estimated total output of more than 16 million dan, which can be processed into more than 1.4 million dan of cane sugar.

Fujian Province is one of the major sugar-producing areas in the country. Since liberation, sugar production has increased year by year. For example, taking 1952 as 100, 1953 reached 113, and 1954 increased again compared with 1953. In order to increase sugar production, the state has established machine sugar factories in the main sugar-producing counties of Xianyou, Nan'an, and others this year.

This year, more than 650,000 dan of sugar have been shipped out of the province. The sales volume of sugar in the province from January to October this year increased by 2.8 times compared with the same period last year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    福建省甘蔗产量增加
    福建省二十八万九千多亩甘蔗开始收割，预计总产量达一千六百多万担，可榨成蔗糖一百四十多万担。
    福建省是全国主要产糖区之一。解放以来，糖产量逐年增长。如以一九五二年为一百，一九五三年达到一百十三，一九五四年比一九五三年又有增加。为了提高食糖生产量，今年国家在主要糖产区仙游、南安等县设立了机器制糖厂。
    今年，运出省外的食糖已有六十五万多担。省内今年一月到十月的食糖销售量，比去年同期增加二点八倍。　　（据新华社讯）
