Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 20th: TASS reported that on December 20th, A.A. Gromyko, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, received the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hayter, and handed him a note from the Soviet Government to the British Government. The full text of the note is as follows:

    The Soviet Government considers it necessary to call the attention of the British Government to the fact that the British Government's action in concluding the so-called Paris Agreements is fundamentally at variance with the obligations undertaken by Great Britain under the "Treaty of Alliance in the War Against Hitlerite Germany and its Associates in Europe and for Collaboration and Mutual Assistance Thereafter, between the Union Of Soviet Socialistic Republics and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland".
    This treaty was signed on May 26, 1942, when the Soviet Union, together with Great Britain and other countries of the anti-Hitler coalition, was jointly engaged in a difficult struggle against their common enemy, Hitlerite Germany. The Anglo-Soviet Treaty, cemented by the blood of the best sons of the Soviet and British peoples and concluded in accordance with the desire of the two peoples for close cooperation, stipulates that the Soviet Union and Great Britain shall take joint measures in the post-war period to prevent the possibility of renewed aggression by Germany or any other state in Europe associated with it in aggression.
    The treaty, which is valid until 1962, states:
    "Article 1. The High Contracting Parties declare their desire to unite with other like-minded States in adopting proposals for common action to preserve peace and resist aggression in the post-war period.
    Article 2. Pending the adoption of such proposals, they will, after the termination of hostilities, take all measures in their power to render impossible a renewal of aggression and violation of peace by Germany or any of the States associated with her in Europe in aggression." (Article 3)
    The treaty also states:
    Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes not conclude any alliance and not to take part in any coalition directed against the other High Contracting Party (Article VII).
    Under this treaty, the Soviet Union and Great Britain agreed to close and friendly cooperation in the post-war period in order to lay the foundations for European security, and agreed to provide each other with all military and other assistance in the event that either of the contracting parties is again subjected to aggression by Germany.
    The purpose of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty is to promote peace and prevent new aggression by Germany or states in Europe associated with it in aggression, while the Paris Agreements signed by the British Government lead to the revival of German militarism, thereby creating the threat of new German aggression. These agreements provide for the remilitarization of West Germany and the establishment of a West German army led by former Hitlerite generals, who not long ago carried out bloody terror and repressive fascist regimes in the occupied territories of some European countries and ravaged many towns and villages in the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, Poland, and other European countries that suffered German militarist aggression.
    Not only is a large army with a large air force, tanks, heavy artillery, navy and its own general staff being established in West Germany, but the entire West German heavy industry, including the Ruhr industrial area, is being turned to armaments production again.
    The Paris Agreements, in violation of existing international agreements, hand over atomic, chemical and bacteriological weapons to West German militarists and revanchists, which greatly increases the danger of causing a devastating atomic, chemical and bacteriological war with very terrible consequences and incalculable losses, which is a particularly serious danger for those European countries that are small in territory and densely populated.
    At the same time, the Paris Agreements stipulate that a remilitarized West Germany be incorporated into the aggressive North Atlantic Group and other military groups aimed at the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. This means that Great Britain, as one of the main organizers and participants in these groups, will participate in a military group with the reviving German militarism, even though under the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, Great Britain guaranteed not to conclude any military alliance or participate in any alliance directed against the Soviet Union.
    The Soviet Government has repeatedly, especially in its notes of October 23, November 13, and December 9 of this year, pointed out that this action by the British Government clearly violates the letter and spirit of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance for Post-War Cooperation and Mutual Assistance.
    By participating in the Paris Agreements, Great Britain has seriously violated its obligations under the Anglo-Soviet Treaty regarding the prevention of the possibility of new German aggression and non-participation in military alliances directed against the Soviet Union.
    The Soviet Government has more than once called the British Government's attention to the dangers of the policy of reviving German militarism. Moreover, the Soviet Government has been pointing out the necessity for the Soviet Union and Great Britain to take joint measures to strengthen European peace and security and to solve the urgent problems related to Germany.
    In order to reach an agreement on the reunification of Germany into a peace-loving and democratic state through free all-German elections, the Soviet Government has proposed that a four-power foreign ministers' conference be convened immediately.
    The Soviet Government has also suggested that the British Government work towards the conclusion of an all-European treaty on the establishment of an effective European collective security system in which all European countries, regardless of their social and political systems, can participate. The conclusion of this treaty can guarantee peaceful conditions for the development of the peoples of Europe. To this end, the Soviet Government proposed that a pan-European conference including all the countries concerned be convened at the end of November to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system.
    The purpose of all these proposals by the Soviet Government is to prevent the revival of German militarism and to strengthen and develop the friendly relations between Great Britain and the Soviet Union, which is a particularly important factor for the security of Great Britain and the Soviet Union and for the advancement of world peace.
    The Soviet Government notes with regret that the British Government has refused participate in establishing a European collective security system and resolving the urgent task of reunifying Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. The British Government's refusal of the Soviet Government's above-mentioned proposals and its friendly warnings shows that it is unwilling to consider its obligations under the Anglo-Soviet Treaty, and unwilling to consider the interests of strengthening peace and the security of the peoples of Europe.
    The British Government's current policy is not only inconsistent with the obligations undertaken by Great Britain under the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance in the War Against Hitlerite Germany and its Associates in Europe and for Collaboration and Mutual Assistance Thereafter, but is openly directed against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries.
    The British Government has not only signed the Paris Agreements and made Parliament approve these agreements, but has also exerted heavy pressure on other European countries that signed the agreements in order to accelerate the approval of these agreements. Therefore, it is attempting to accelerate the remilitarization of West Germany and the incorporation of West Germany into the aforementioned military groups.
    In this situation, the Anglo-Soviet Treaty loses its meaning and cannot achieve the purpose for which it was originally concluded. Moreover, since the British Government has disregarded the existence of this treaty, embarked on the road of reviving West German militarism, and is pulling a remilitarized West Germany into military groups directed against the Soviet Union and other peace-loving European countries, the Anglo-Soviet Treaty can no longer serve the interests of peace, but on the contrary, has become merely a smokescreen concealing the current policy of the British Government, which has already joined an aggressive military group headed by the United States of America.
    The Soviet Government cannot tolerate this situation and must frankly state this to the Soviet people and the British people.
    All this proves that the approval of the Paris Agreements will certainly seriously complicate the entire European situation, the approval of the Paris Agreements is not in the interests of European peace and security, and this agreement is only needed by the aggressive groups of certain countries that are busy preparing for another war.
    In this situation, the Soviet Government considers it its duty to declare that the approval of the Paris Agreements will invalidate the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance for Post-War Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, and will render this treaty null and void. The entire responsibility for this situation will be borne by Great Britain and by the British Government.
    After the Paris Agreements are approved, the Soviet Government will only be able to submit to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union the proposal to abolish the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance in the War Against Hitlerite Germany and its Associates in Europe and for Collaboration and Mutual Assistance Thereafter concluded between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
    Moscow, December 20, 1954.
    The British Ambassador said that he would forward the note to his government.

### 苏联政府照会英国政府  指出批准巴黎协定就会使英苏条约作废

    苏联政府照会英国政府
    指出批准巴黎协定就会使英苏条约作废
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日电：苏联外交部第一副部长安·安·葛罗米柯十二月二十日接见了英国驻苏联大使海特尔，交给他苏联政府致英国政府的照会一份。照会全文如下：
    苏联政府认为有必要促请英国政府注意下面的事实：英国政府缔结所谓巴黎协定的行动是同英国根据“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国缔结的战时反对希特勒德国及其欧洲与国与战后合作互助同盟条约”所承担的义务根本相抵触的。
    这个条约是在一九四二年五月二十六日签订的，当时苏联同英国和反希特勒联盟的其他国家一起，正在共同进行着反对它们的共同敌人——希特勒德国——的艰苦斗争。这个由苏联和英国两国人民最优秀的儿子们的鲜血巩固下来的，根据两国人民要求紧密合作的愿望缔结的英苏条约规定英苏两国在战后时期采取共同措施，来防止德国或在欧洲同它合伙采取侵略行动的任何其他国家重新发动侵略的可能性。
    这个有效期间到一九六二年为止的条约说：
    “一、缔约国双方声明，愿与其他具有同样意志的国家联合采纳在战后时期共同行动以维持和平并抵抗侵略的各种建议。
    二、在此项建议被采纳以前，双方在战事结束后，当即就权力所及，采取一切措置，务使德国或在欧洲与之合伙参加侵略行动的任何一国，不可能再肆侵略与破坏和平。”（第三条）
    条约又说：
    缔约国双方承诺决不缔结反对他方之任何同盟，或参加反对他方之任何集团（第七条）。
    根据这个条约，苏联和英国同意在战后时期进行密切的和友好的合作，以便奠立欧洲的安全，并且同意在缔约国一方再度遭到德国的侵略时彼此提供一切军事援助和其他援助。
    英苏条约的目的是促进和平和防止德国或在欧洲与之合伙参加侵略行动的国家进行新的侵略，而英国政府签订的巴黎协定却导向德国军国主义的复活，从而造成德国新侵略的威胁。这些协定规定西德重新军国主义化和建立一支由前希特勒将军统率的西德军队，这些将军们在不久以前还在一些欧洲国家的被占领的领土上实行血腥恐怖和镇压的法西斯制度，并且蹂躏苏联、英国、法国、波兰以及遭受德国军国主义侵略的其他欧洲国家的许多城镇和乡村。
    不仅一支拥有大规模空军、坦克、重炮、海军和它自己的参谋总部的庞大的军队正在西德建立，而且，整个西德的重工业，包括鲁尔区工业在内，正被再度转向军备生产。
    巴黎协定违反现行国际协定，把原子武器、化学武器和细菌武器交给西德军国主义者和复仇主义者，这就大大增加了引起一次有着非常可怕的后果和不可估计的损失的毁灭性的原子战争、化学战争和细菌战争的危险，这对于那些领土狭小而人口稠密的欧洲国家是一个特别严重的危险。
    同时，巴黎协定规定把一个重新军国主义化的西德并入侵略性的北大西洋集团和矛头指向苏联和各人民民主国家的其他军事集团。这就是说，英国作为这些集团的主要组织者和参加者之一，它将参加一个有正在复活着的德国军国主义参加的军事集团，尽管根据英苏条约，英国保证不缔结任何军事联盟、不参加任何针对着苏联的同盟。
    苏联政府已经一再地，特别是在今年十月二十三日、十一月十三日和十二月九日的照会中指出，英国政府的这种行动明显地违反了英苏战后合作互助同盟条约的文字和精神。
    由于参加了巴黎协定，英国已经严重地违反了它根据英苏条约所承担的关于防止新的德国侵略的可能性和不参加针对着苏联的军事联盟的义务。
    苏联政府已不止一次地促请英国政府注意复活德国军国主义的政策的危险性。而且，苏联政府一直在指出，苏联和英国采取共同措施来加强欧洲和平和安全并且解决同德国有关的迫切问题的必要性。
    为了就通过全德自由选举把德国重新统一成为一个爱好和平的民主国家达成协议，苏联政府曾建议立即召开四国外长会议。
    苏联政府也曾建议英国政府为缔结一个关于建立所有的欧洲国家——不问其社会和政治制度如何——都可以参加的有效的欧洲集体安全体系的全欧条约而努力。这一条约的缔结可以保证欧洲各国人民发展的和平条件。为了这个目的，苏联政府建议在十一月底召开包括所有有关国家的全欧会议来讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。
    苏联政府的所有这些建议的目的在于，防止德国军国主义复活，加强并且发展英国和苏联间的友好关系，这种友好关系对英国和苏联的安全、对促进世界和平是一个特别重要的因素。
    苏联政府遗憾地指出，英国政府已经拒绝参加建立欧洲集体安全体系和解决在和平和民主的基础上重新统一德国的迫切任务。英国政府拒绝苏联政府上述建议和它的友好的警告的举动表明，它不愿意考虑它根据英苏条约所承担的义务，不愿意考虑加强和平和欧洲各国人民安全的利益。
    英国政府目前的政策不但不符合于英国根据苏英战时反对希特勒德国及其欧洲与国与战后合作互助同盟条约所承担的义务、而且是公开针对苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的。
    英国政府不仅签订了巴黎协定、使议会批准了这些协定、而且还对签订协定的其他欧洲国家施加沉重的压力、以便加速这些协定的批准。因此它是在企图加速西德重新军国主义化和把西德并入上述军事集团。
    在这种情况下，英苏条约就失去了它的意义，并且不能达到它原来缔结时的目的。而且由于英国政府已经不顾这个条约的存在，走上了复活西德军国主义的道路，并且正在把重新军国主义化的西德拉入针对着苏联和其他爱好和平的欧洲国家的军事集团，英苏条约不仅不再能为和平的利益服务，而且相反的，倒成了只是掩饰已经加入以美利坚合众国为首的侵略性的军事集团的英国政府的目前政策的烟幕。
    苏联政府不能容忍这种局势，并且不得不向苏联人民和英国人民坦白地说明这一点。
    这一切都证明，批准巴黎协定一定会使整个欧洲局势严重地复杂起来，批准巴黎协定是不符合欧洲和平和安全的利益的，而且只有忙于准备另一次战争的某些国家的侵略集团才需要这个协定。
    在这种情况下，苏联政府认为它有责任宣布：批准巴黎协定会勾销英苏战后合作互助同盟条约，会使这个条约作废。这种情况的全部责任要由英国、由英国政府来负。
    在巴黎协定批准后，苏联政府就只能向苏联最高苏维埃主席团提出废除苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国所缔结的苏英战时反对希特勒德国及其欧洲与国与战后合作互助同盟条约的建议。
    一九五四年十二月二十日于莫斯科。
    英国大使说，他将把照会转交给他的政府。
