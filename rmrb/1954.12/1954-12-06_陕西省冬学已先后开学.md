Winter schools in various parts of Shaanxi Province mostly opened in mid-November. It is estimated that 700,000 farmers will participate in the study this year. The content of this year's winter school, in addition to requiring students to complete one or two farmer literacy textbooks, will also provide students with policy and current affairs education to improve their socialist awareness.

In order to ensure the smooth development of winter school work, the province has selected more than 20,000 people to serve as winter school teachers (many of whom are junior and senior primary school graduates participating in agricultural production), and organized them to study relevant teaching methods and various policies.

    陕西省冬学已先后开学
    陕西省各地冬学多在十一月中旬先后开学，预计今年将有七十万农民参加学习。今年冬学的内容，除要求学员学完一本到两本农民识字课本外，还要向学员进行政策和时事教育，以提高学员的社会主义觉悟。
    为了保证冬学工作顺利的开展，全省选拔了二万多人来担任冬学教师（其中很多是参加农业生产的初中和高小毕业生），并组织他们进行了有关教学方法和各项政策的学习。
