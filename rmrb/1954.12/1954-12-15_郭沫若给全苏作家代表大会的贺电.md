Guo Moruo's Congratulatory Telegram to the All-Soviet Writers Congress
To the Second All-Soviet Writers Congress of the Soviet Writers Association,
Dear Comrades:

    All workers in Chinese literary and artistic circles warmly congratulate you on the opening of the Second All-Soviet Writers Congress. Since the First All-Soviet Writers Congress was held twenty years ago, dear Soviet writer comrades, you have inherited and developed the outstanding literary and artistic traditions of the various Soviet nationalities. Under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, following the creative method of socialist realism, you have created many brilliant and excellent works, making an incomparably important contribution to the great construction of socialism and communism, and to the cause of peace and progress of all mankind. Your experience and achievements have always been a model for us to learn from. They have played an invaluable role in inspiring and educating the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and the socialist transformation that is underway.

    Dear friends! We firmly believe that the successful outcome of the Second All-Soviet Writers Congress will enable the great Soviet literature and art to play a greater role in the cause of communist construction and in the cause of defending world peace, and will be of greater help to the progress of literary and artistic undertakings in China and the world. We extend our brotherly congratulations on the success of the conference!

    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
