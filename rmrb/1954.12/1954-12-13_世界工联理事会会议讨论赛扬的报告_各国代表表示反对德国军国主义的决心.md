Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 12th: The Council meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions discussed the report of Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, on the 9th and 10th. Speakers talked about the determination of working people in their countries to oppose imperialist war plans and the revival of German militarism, and about the struggle of millions of workers for peace and security, improved living and working conditions, and democratic freedoms.

W. Klosiewicz, Chairman of the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions, emphasized that the entire Polish people angrily condemned the London and Paris Agreements, which are rearming West Germany. The Polish working people fully support the Moscow Conference Declaration, believing that this declaration is the only path to establishing collective security for the people of European countries and world peace.

Lombardo Toledano, Chairman of the Latin American Labor Federation, said that despite the very difficult conditions for Latin American trade unions to work and struggle, the trade union movement is achieving greater and greater successes. Many strikes have been victorious.

Herbert Warnke, Chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation, said that German workers have intensified their struggle against militarist forces over the past year. This struggle is manifested in workers' actions to achieve their economic demands. The strike movement in West Germany this year has reached a scale never seen since 1932. More than five million factory workers and office employees are fighting for wage increases. German workers are concentrating all their efforts to fight against the ratification of the Paris Agreements in order to protect the people of European countries from the danger of new bloodshed. The Moscow Conference Declaration of European countries and the proposal to establish a unified, peace-loving Germany on a democratic basis are a great support for the German people's struggle against militarism and for the unification of their motherland.

A Japanese trade union representative said that Japanese trade unions have organized many actions to resist the attacks of Japanese and American monopoly capital. They are taking concerted action to defend the rights of working people and trade unions, oppose economic militarization, and strive for the development of a peaceful economy.

Frachon, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor of France, said that the World Federation of Trade Unions and trade unions in all capitalist countries must raise their vigilance and take the struggle against the London and Paris Agreements as their main task. In this struggle, the Moscow Conference and its resolutions, which pointed out the only viable path for reaching international agreements, provide enormous support to the trade unions and working people of all countries.

Frachon suggested that European workers hold a meeting as soon as possible to oppose the remilitarization of West Germany, strive for improved living and working conditions, and fight for peace. He suggested holding an international conference of working women next year under the slogan of "Equal Pay for Equal Work."

Solovyov, Vice Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, and Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting.

Representatives from Panama, Uruguay, Hungary, Romania, Indonesia, and some international organizations also spoke at the meeting.

    世界工联理事会会议讨论赛扬的报告
    各国代表表示反对德国军国主义的决心
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社华沙讯：世界工会联合会理事会会议九日和十日讨论了世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬的报告。发言者谈到他们国家中劳动人民反对帝国主义战争计划、反对复活德国军国主义的决心，谈到千百万工人正在为争取和平和安全、改善生活和劳动条件、争取民主自由而斗争的情况。
    波兰工会中央理事会主席维·克沃谢维奇强调指出，波兰全国人民愤怒地谴责重新武装西德的伦敦和巴黎协定。波兰劳动人民完全拥护莫斯科会议的宣言，认为这个宣言是建立欧洲各国人民的集体安全和世界和平的唯一道路。
    拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席伦巴多·托列达诺说，尽管拉丁美洲工会进行工作和斗争的条件非常艰苦，但是工会运动正在获得愈来愈大的成就。许多次罢工获得了胜利。
    自由德国工会联合会主席赫伯特·瓦恩克说，一年来德国工人已加紧了反对军国主义势力的斗争。这种斗争表现在工人争取实现他们的经济要求的行动上。西德的罢工运动今年达到了一九三二年以来从来没有达到过的规模。有五百多万工厂工人和机关职员为争取增加工资而进行斗争。德国工人正在集中全部力量来进行斗争，反对批准巴黎协定，以便保护欧洲各国人民免受新的流血的危险。欧洲国家莫斯科会议的宣言以及在民主基础上建立统一的、爱好和平的德国的建议，对德国人民反对军国主义、争取他们祖国统一的斗争是一个很大的支持。
    日本工会代表说，日本工会已经组织了许多次行动来反抗日本和美国垄断资本的进攻。他们采取一致行动来保卫劳动人民和工会的权利，反对经济军事化，争取发展和平经济。
    法国总工会总书记弗拉商说，世界工会联合会和一切资本主义国家的工会必须提高它们的警惕，把反对伦敦和巴黎协定的斗争作为它们的主要任务。在这个斗争中，莫斯科会议和它作出的指明国际间达成协议的唯一行得通的道路的决议，给予各国工会和劳动人民以巨大的支援。
    弗拉商建议欧洲的工人们尽速举行一次会议，来反对西德重新军国主义化，争取改善生活和劳动条件，争取和平。他建议明年在“同工同酬”的口号下举行一次国际劳动妇女大会。
    全苏工会中央理事会副主席索洛维耶夫、中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一在会上发了言。
    在会上发言的还有巴拿马、乌拉圭、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、印度尼西亚及一些国际组织的代表。
