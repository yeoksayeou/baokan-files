    More Attention to Urban Design and Architecture
    By Soviet Architect Bu. Svietlichny
    By Soviet Engineer V. Chinkarenko

    With the country's industrialization, the number of urban residents in the Soviet Union tripled from 1926 to 1953. The purpose of urban construction in the Soviet Union is, first and foremost, to improve the living conditions and cultural facilities of residents, and to create a healthy environment for their lives, work and recreation.
    The scale of urban construction in the Soviet Union is unprecedented. It suffices to point out that nearly eight hundred new cities were built on the vast land of our motherland from 1926 to 1953, including the most gigantic industrial centers: such as Magnitogorsk, Stalinsk, and Komsomolsk-on-Amur. The number of workers' residential areas increased from 584 in 1934 to 2,444 in 1954, more than tripling.
    The Party and the government pay close attention to urban construction and urban facilities. The appropriations for residential, municipal and cultural life buildings are increasing year by year. In the year 1954 alone, 35 billion rubles will be spent in various cities and urban-type residential areas.
    We can be proud of the extensive work we have done to restore the settlements destroyed during the war. Kyiv, Minsk, Stalingrad, Rostov-on-Don and other cities have now become more beautiful. Dozens of large industrial centers such as Sverdlovsk, Chelyabinsk, Kuibyshev, Khabarovsk, and Novosibirsk have greatly changed their appearance. Residential and public building complexes have been established, the facilities in the centers of cities are being rebuilt and improved, new coastal avenues, gardens and parks are being built, and water supply, sewage and urban transportation networks are being expanded.
    However, it must be admitted that in the actual work of urban construction, there are still many serious shortcomings. Because buildings are often scattered, and because construction is not concentrated in the main areas forming the city, but is carried out on vast areas and scattered plots, building individual buildings or clusters of houses, the quality of urban design and construction, as well as the city's facilities and overall architectural appearance, have been severely damaged.
    Industrial enterprises usually try to build low-rise buildings in the suburbs, and are very reluctant to build large buildings on the main streets of the city. For example, in the total construction area completed in various cities in recent years, the residential area of new buildings in the central area of Kuibyshev only accounts for 16 percent of the city's new construction area, Molotov City – 12 percent, Krasnoyarsk – 9 percent, Sverdlovsk – 6 percent, Tula and Grozny each accounting for 5 percent, and Vladimir – 2 percent. In Ulyanovsk, Stalino, Krasnoyarsk, Kamensk-Uralsky and many other cities, industrial enterprises concentrate almost all of their housing in residential areas far from the city.
    Some economic workers comfort themselves with the idea that the construction of low-rise buildings in the first stage requires lower facility requirements, so this type of house is sometimes cheaper than high-rise buildings. However, this type of building requires more expense to lay long roads, water pipes, sewers and other transportation networks, so in the final analysis, it is much more expensive than building high-rise buildings. In addition, one should never forget another situation, that is, under the above circumstances, the residents of the residential areas are artificially isolated from urban cultural and educational institutions and other institutions.
    From the perspective of national interests, this excessive expansion of low-rise office buildings in cities should also be considered incorrect. Because in addition to causing the scattering of buildings, it also inappropriately expands the city's land area and increases the city's facility costs. At the same density, a two-story building occupies twice as much ground as a four-story building, and the facility cost for each additional hectare of ground is more than one million rubles.
    For example, the Yaroslavl Automobile Manufacturing Plant, ignoring the fact that new housing can be built in the city center without demolishing old houses, has been blindly building two-story buildings near the factory in the suburbs in recent years. Due to this waste, the state has lost 24 million rubles here. In the past six years, the area of one- to two-story buildings built in Molotov City, Krasnoyarsk, Grozny, Gorky, Tula, Kemerovo and many other cities accounted for 70 percent of the total residential area, which inappropriately expanded the city area: exceeding the design area by two to three times. However, practice has proved that most cities should mainly build four- and five-story buildings, because this type of house is the most economical and convenient.
    The construction of private housing should be thoroughly improved. The growth of the material welfare of the Soviet people, as well as the state's massive financial assistance to working people, has promoted the large-scale construction of private housing. For example, in 1953, Rostov-on-Don allocated 1,500 plots for the construction of private housing, Zaporozhye allocated nearly 2,000 plots, Kharkov – 2,202 plots, and Stalingrad – 4,500 plots. At the same time, it should now be noted that the construction of private housing often develops in the absence of proper supervision. The supply of blueprints and building materials to private housing builders is also not properly organized, so the houses built often look unsightly and do not meet the requirements of hygiene and daily life.
    The distribution of private housing often lacks careful consideration. In a large part of some large cities, many buildings with poor quality and facilities have been built. This makes it very difficult to improve facilities, adds trouble for later additions to buildings, and damages the overall architectural appearance of the city. Our opinion is that the main part of private housing construction in cities should be distributed in residential areas along railways and highways in the suburbs.
    The shortcomings of urban and residential area facilities are often caused by the incorrect attitude taken by various departments engaged in residential construction towards solving the problems of water supply, sewage, paving sidewalks, roads and greening residential areas. They usually carry out this part of the project at the very end, which rudely violates the government's resolution on improving residential construction on April 23, 1934. The construction funds allocated by the state for urban water supply projects and sewage projects are usually not used, and the construction organizations carrying out such projects also lack good technical equipment. Enterprises that receive funds for improving residential area facilities do not make the necessary connections with municipal construction agencies and other enterprises when carrying out this work, which results in the duplication of construction projects for water pipes, centralized pipelines and water purification buildings, thus bringing significant losses to the interests of various districts and residents and wasting a large amount of state funds in vain.
    In order to eliminate this departmental chaos, a mandatory cooperation system should already be implemented among various construction units on the principle of shared tasks, in order to jointly complete city-wide engineering construction, and at the same time, it is necessary to ensure the organizational role of the city Soviet executive committee in this regard. The executive committees of various city Soviets have repeatedly put forward this proposal a long time ago, and the Soviet State Planning Committee should finally pay attention to this proposal.
    Many shortcomings in urban construction are due to the backwardness of planning and design work, and the poor quality of urban plans and architectural designs themselves. To date, only 40 percent of all cities have a general construction plan for the city. Even large industrial and cultural centers such as Gorky, Stalino, Zaporozhye, Voronezh, Tashkent and Tbilisi do not have finally determined city plans, although the formulation of these plans has been going on for many years. Designers have not paid attention to the most important issues of the city's primary buildings.
    For this reason, some new industrial enterprises are sometimes hastily built on unprepared sites. The lack of careful planning for industrial areas disrupts the work of railway hub stations, makes it inconvenient to lead lines to enterprises, and results in railway branch lines and high-voltage lines running through residential areas, violating sanitary standards and so on.
    Planned construction in newly opened areas can produce completely different results. The new city of Volzhsky built near the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station can be clearly used as an example to illustrate this point. Here, all projects are carried out according to pre-determined plans, and there is no temporary housing built here. Instead, permanent, large-scale residential areas with complete facilities are built directly.
    At the same time, special attention should also be paid to the design of the primary residential areas and the various buildings that form the central areas of densely populated large cities. This is because many cities, even the capitals of the following union republics: Kyiv, Petrozavodsk, Riga, Frunze, Alma-Ata, Ashgabat, do not yet have good and approved designs for the main lines and squares of the city. This situation seriously affects the architectural style of urban construction.
    The methods of using standard housing designs to build city streets and residential areas are particularly backward. In the near future, most of the residential construction will be carried out according to this standard housing. This task should mainly be undertaken by the Soviet Academy of Architecture. Unfortunately, there are still very few good standard designs, and this type of design is rarely used in actual construction. This greatly increases construction costs. The Academy of Architecture obviously does not pay enough attention to scientific research on standard design and construction economics.
    Well-organized construction plays a significant role in accelerating construction speed and reducing construction costs. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize once again the need to widely adopt rapid flow-line operations, mechanize and industrialize construction work, and use prefabricated reinforced concrete most comprehensively in urban construction.
    The integration of small construction organizations is of great significance. As everyone knows, the worst quality of work, the violation of construction deadlines and the occurrence of large losses mostly occur in construction organizations with weak strength.
    The quality of construction has a significant impact on the architectural style of urban construction. Sloppy construction, violation of technical quotas and technical regulations, use of poor-quality building materials, and excessive extension of construction deadlines will bring significant material losses to the country. For example, the "Molotov Construction Engineering" Trust of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry spent 3 million rubles to repair 69 completed houses. The "Stalingrad Cultural Construction Engineering" Trust took eight years to build a building for the court and procuratorate. Due to the violation of construction deadlines and the very poor construction quality, 3 million rubles were lost on this building, which is equal to 55 percent of the project's budget.
    In the work of improving the quality of urban construction and improving urban facilities, one of the main tasks is to strengthen urban construction discipline. In Molotov City, in recent years, due to the connivance of the city Soviet, various factories have rudely violated the city's general construction plan and arbitrarily built 66 low-rise buildings in factory areas and high-rise building areas. In 1953, according to the decision of the Molotov City Executive Committee, 131 unfinished buildings were used. In Krasnoyarsk, the construction of 132 houses seriously violated current regulations. In Kyiv and Stalinabad, thousands of private houses are arbitrarily built in areas not specified in the city's general construction plan, and these houses are often unsuitable for living. Grozny City arbitrarily built 400 houses in recent years, of which 44 private houses had to be demolished in 1953 due to new construction.
    A system should be established to make the city's general construction plan a national, unshakeable document, and those who violate this general plan should be subject to severe legal sanctions. The city Soviet executive committee bears particular responsibility in this important work. The Soviet Academy of Architecture and the Soviet Union of Architects should play a significant role in improving urban construction and facilities. However, they have so far been standing idly by the practical problems of urban construction.
    The best guarantee for maintaining a high quality of planning, design and construction of cities is to attract the broad masses of working people to creatively discuss these construction plans, which are being built for them.

    更多地关心城市的设计和建筑
    苏联建筑师  布·斯维特里契内依
    苏联工程师  伏·钦加连柯
    随着国家的工业化，由一九二六年到一九五三年，苏联的城市居民人数增加了两倍。苏联的城市建筑的目的，首先是改善居民的居住条件和文化生活设施，为他们建立生活、劳动和休息的健康环境。
    苏联的城市建筑规模是史无前例的。只须指出一点就够了：在我们祖国的辽阔土地上，从一九二六年到一九五三年共建设了近八百座新的城市，其中包括最巨大的工业中心：如马格尼托哥尔斯克、斯大林斯克、阿穆尔河上的共青团城。工人住宅区的数目从一九三四年的五百八十四处增加到一九五四年的二千四百四十四处，即增加了三倍多。
    党和政府十分注意城市建筑和城市设备。对住宅的、市政的和文化生活的建筑的拨款在逐年增加。仅在一九五四年度，在各个城市和城市型的住宅区中，用于这方面的经费便将有三百五十亿卢布。
    我们对恢复战争时期遭到破坏的居民点所做的大量工作，是完全可以引以自豪的。基辅、明斯克、斯大林格勒、顿河上的罗斯托夫和其他一些城市，现在变得更加美丽了。几十个像斯维尔德洛夫斯克、车里雅宾斯克、古比雪夫、伯力、诺沃西比尔斯克那样的大工业中心，现在已大大改变了外貌。住宅和公共建筑物的建筑群已经建立起来，正在改建和改善各城市中心的设备，建筑新的沿岸大街、花园和公园，扩大自来水管、下水道和城市运输网。
    但是，应当承认，在城市建筑的实际工作中，直到现在还存有许多严重缺点。由于建筑物常是分散的，由于没有在形成城市的主要区域中集中建筑，而是在广大的面积和分散的地段上建造一些个别建筑物或一簇簇的房屋，使城市设计和建筑的质量以及城市的设备和总的建筑外貌，受到了严重的损害。
    各工业企业通常总是力图在城郊建筑低层楼房，很不愿意在城市各主要大街建筑大型楼房。例如，在各城市近数年完成的总建筑面积中，古比雪夫市中心区新建筑的住宅面积只占该市新建筑面积的百分之十六，莫洛托夫市——百分之十二，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克——百分之九，斯维尔德洛夫斯克——百分之六，图拉和格罗兹内各占百分之五，弗拉基米尔——百分之二。在乌里雅诺夫斯克、斯大林诺、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克、卡麦—乌拉尔和其他许多城市，各工业企业几乎把自己的全部住房都集中在远离城市的住宅区里。
    某些经济工作人员用这样的道理来安慰自己：在第一阶段低层楼房的建造，对设备的要求比较低，所以这种房子有时比高层楼房省些钱。但是，这种建筑物需要更多的花费来铺设很长的道路，敷设自来水管、下水道和其他交通网，因此归根到底，它要比建筑高层楼房的费用贵得多。此外，也决不应忘记另一情况，即在上述情况下，住宅区的居民被人为地同城市文化教育机关和其他机关隔绝了。
    从国家利益着眼，这种在城市中过度扩展低层的机关用楼房，也应被认作是不正确的。因为这除了造成建筑物的分散外，还不适当地扩大了城市占地面积，增大城市的设备费用。在同样密度下，两层楼的建筑物要比四层楼的建筑物多占一倍地面，而每增加一公顷地面所需的设备费就在百万卢布以上。
    例如，雅罗斯拉夫里汽车制造厂，不顾在市中心区不拆除旧房屋也可以建筑新住宅的事实，近年来在郊区工厂附近，一味建筑两层楼房。由于这种浪费，使国家在这里损失了二千四百万卢布。近六年来，在莫洛托夫市、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克、格罗兹内、高尔基、图拉、克蔑洛沃和许多其他城市所建筑的一层到两层楼房的面积，占全部住宅面积的百分之七十，由于这样，就不适当地扩大了城市面积：超过设计面积二到三倍。可是，实践却证明，多数城市都应当主要建筑四、五层楼的建筑物，因为正是这种房屋才是最经济和最方便的。
    私人住宅的建筑应当彻底加以改善。苏联人的物质福利的增长，以及国家对劳动人民的大量财政援助，促进了私人住宅的大规模建造。例如，一九五三年，顿河的罗斯托夫市为建造私人住宅划出了一千五百个地段，查坡洛什划出了近两千个地段，哈尔科夫——二千二百零二个地段，斯大林格勒——四千五百个地段。同时，现在应该注意到，私人住宅的建筑常是在缺乏适当监督的情况下发展着。供应私人住宅建筑者以设计图纸和建筑材料的事也没有适当地组织，因此，建筑的房子，外貌往往很难看，而且不符合卫生和日常生活的要求。
    对私人住宅的分布往往缺乏周密的考虑。在一些大城市的很大一部分土地上竟建盖了许多质量、设备都很差的建筑物。这样就使改善设备发生很大困难，为后来的增加建筑物添加了麻烦，并损害了城市的总的建筑外貌。我们的意见是，城市中私人住宅建筑的主要部分，应当分布在城郊的铁路和公路线两旁的住宅区里。
    城市和住宅区的设备的缺点，常是由于进行住宅建筑的各部对解决自来水供应、下水道、铺设人行道、马路和绿化住宅区的问题采取了不正确态度所引起的。它们通常总是到最后才去进行这一部分工程，这就粗暴地违反了政府在一九三四年四月二十三日关于改善住宅建筑的决议。国家拨用于城市自来水工程和下水道工程的建筑经费照例未加动用，进行这类工程的建筑组织也缺乏良好的技术装备。领到改善住宅区设备的经费的企业，在进行这项工作时也不和市政建设机构和其他企业取得应有联系，这就造成自来水管、集中管道和净化水建筑物的建筑工程的重复，因而为各区设备和居民利益带来重大损失并白白浪费国家的大量资金。
    为了消除这种本位主义的混乱现象，已经应当使各建筑单位在分担任务的原则上实行一种强制合作制度，以便共同完成全市性的工程建筑，同时，并要保证市苏维埃执行委员会在这方面的组织作用。各个市苏维埃执行委员会很早就一再提出了这项建议，而苏联国家计划委员会，最后，也应当重视这一建议了。
    城市建筑的许多缺点，是由于计划工作和设计工作落后，由于城市计划和建筑的设计本身质量原就很差造成的。截至目前，所有城市中只有百分之四十是有市的总建筑计划的。甚至像高尔基、斯大林诺、查坡洛什、沃龙湼什、塔什干和第比里斯这样大的工业和文化中心，也没有最后确定的城市计划，虽然这些计划的制定已进行了好多年。设计人员没有注意城市的首要建筑物的各种最重要问题。
    由于这个原因，一些新的工业企业有时竟匆忙地被建筑在没有准备好的场地上。对工业区缺乏周密考虑的计划，打乱了铁路枢纽站的工作，使线路不便于引往企业，结果造成铁路支线和高压线横穿各住宅区，破坏了卫生标准和其他等等。
    对新开辟的地区进行有计划的建筑可以产生完全不同的结果，只须用斯大林格勒水电站附近建筑的新城市伏尔加城为例就可以明显地说明这点。这里一切工程都是根据事先拟定的计划进行的，而且这里并没有搭盖临时住宅，就迳直盖起了设备完善的永久性的、大规模的住宅区。
    同时，也应当特别注意制定首要的住宅区和那些形成人口稠密的大城市的中心区的各项建筑物的设计。这是因为很多城市，甚至像下列加盟共和国的首都：基辅、彼得罗萨佛得斯克、里加、伏龙芝、阿拉木图、阿什哈巴德，都还没有制定好的和经过批准的城市主要干线和广场的设计。这种情况严重地影响了城市建筑的建筑风格。
    在制定利用标准房屋的设计来建筑城市街道和住宅区的方法方面，尤其落后。在最近的将来大部分的住宅建设都要按照这种标准房屋来进行。这项任务主要地应由苏联建筑科学院担当起来。可惜的是，好的标准设计还很少，这类设计在实际建筑中还很少采用。这样就大大增加了建筑费用。建筑科学院显然没有足够重视对标准设计和建筑经济学的科学研究工作。
    良好地组织施工在加快建筑速度和降低建筑费用方面起着重大的作用。因此，就应当再度强调广泛采取快速流水作业法、使建筑工作机械化和工厂化、在城市建筑中最全面地使用装配式钢筋混凝土的必要性。
    联合小的建筑组织，具有重要的意义。正如大家所知道的，工作质量最差，破坏建筑期限和受亏损很大的情事，多半是发生在力量薄弱的建筑组织里。
    施工的质量对城市建筑的建筑风格有着显著影响。粗枝大叶地施工，破坏技术定额和技术规程，使用质量差的建筑材料，以及过度延长建筑期限，都会给国家带来重大的物质损失。例如，石油工业部“莫洛托夫建筑工程”托辣斯为修理已经竣工的六十九幢房屋就用去了三百万卢布。“斯大林格勒文化建筑工程”托辣斯八年才盖好了法院和检察机关用的一所建筑物。由于破坏建筑期限和建筑质量很差，在这幢房屋上亏损了三百万卢布，即等于这项工程预算费用的百分之五十五。
    在提高城市建筑质量、使城市设备完善的工作中，主要任务之一就是加强城市建筑纪律。在莫洛托夫市，近几年来由于市苏维埃的纵容，各工厂粗鲁地破坏了城市的总建筑计划，任意在工厂区和高楼房建筑地区建盖了六十六幢低层楼房。一九五三年，根据莫洛托夫市执行委员会的决定，动用了一百三十一幢未完工的建筑物。在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克，有一百三十二幢房屋的施工严重地违反了现行规章。在基辅和斯大林纳巴德有几千所私人住宅任意建筑在城市总建筑计划所没有规定的地区，并且这些房子常是不适合于居住的。格罗兹内市在最近几年内随便建筑了四百幢房屋，其中的四十四幢私人房屋，又因一九五三年进行新建筑而不得不加以拆毁。
    应当建立一种制度，使城市的总建筑计划成为国家的不可动摇的文件，破坏这个总计划的人应受严厉的法律制裁。市苏维埃执行委员会在这一重要工作上尤其负有责任。苏联建筑科学院和苏联建筑师工会在改善城市建筑和设备方面，应起重大的作用。但是它们到目前为止，还是在袖手旁观着城市建筑的实际问题。
    使城市的计划设计和建筑保持高度质量的最好保证，就是吸引广大劳动群众来创造性地讨论这些建筑计划，这些建筑正是为了他们而修建的。
