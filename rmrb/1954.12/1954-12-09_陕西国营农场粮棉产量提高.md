    Shaanxi State-Owned Farms Increase Grain and Cotton Production

    This year, due to improved management in Shaanxi Province's eighty-six state-owned farms, total grain production increased by 70 percent compared to last year, and total cotton production increased by 15 percent compared to last year. It is estimated that profits will exceed 540 million yuan.

    This year, all farms in Shaanxi Province have implemented quota and planned management, and established a responsibility system, thereby reducing non-production personnel by 88 people and saving approximately 700 million yuan in expenses. Most farms also engaged in diversified operations based on specific conditions and in conjunction with agricultural production. This year, Fufeng, Nanzheng, and four other farms profited more than 81 million yuan from sideline production such as pig farming, setting up flour mills, and gristmills. This year, the Hanzhong branch of the Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station raised more than 200 pigs using by-products such as stems and leaves from the farm, not only supplying the state with hogs but also opening up a source of fertilizer, creating conditions for increased grain and cotton production.

    陕西国营农场粮棉产量提高
    今年陕西省八十六个国营农场，由于经营管理水平提高，粮食总产量比去年提高百分之七十，棉花总产量比去年提高百分之十五，预计可盈利五亿四千多万元。
    今年陕西省全省农场都实行了定额和计划管理，建立了责任制，因而减少非生产人员八十八人，节省开支约七亿元。大部农场还根据具体条件，结合农业生产，进行多种经营。扶风、南郑等六个农场今年从养猪、开设粉坊、磨坊等副业生产中盈利八千一百多万元。省农业试验场汉中分场今年利用场内茎叶等副产品，养了二百多只猪，不但给国家供应了毛猪，而且开辟了肥源，给粮食、棉花增产创造了条件。　　　　　　（新华社）
