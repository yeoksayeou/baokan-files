Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd—The United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique jointly issued a statement on December 1st stating that negotiations on the so-called "Common Security Treaty" between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique have been completed.

The statement indicates that the treaty will allow the United States to occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands indefinitely by "recognizing" the so-called "common interests" of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. The statement said that the treaty will stipulate that "other territories under the jurisdiction of both parties can be included after agreement." The statement also said that this treaty is to "deal with armed attacks that endanger the security of the treaty area." This actually means that the United States will actively encourage and support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's war actions against mainland China, while preventing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. However, the statement attempts to deceive world public opinion by claiming that the treaty will be "defensive in nature."

The statement also indicates that this treaty will become a link in the military aggression system established by the United States in the Pacific region.

On the same day, US Secretary of State Dulles stated at a press conference that this treaty between the US and Chiang will be signed in Washington in two or three days.

Dulles stated, "This treaty places Taiwan and the Penghu Islands under the protection of the United States" and gives the United States "base rights in Taiwan." Dulles also openly encouraged and supported the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in carrying out military provocations against mainland China. He arrogantly stated that if the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique gains any land in its attack on the mainland, "this treaty can be expanded to include this area by concluding a new agreement."

Dulles also openly threatened that if the Chinese people liberate their territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, the United States will "retaliate in places of its own choosing and by means of its own choosing." In order to conceal this shameless conspiracy of the US aggressive bloc to create war in the Far East, Dulles even fantasized and said, "A state of war only exists between two mutually recognized governments," "A war between one government that is not recognized by the other does not technically constitute war." Dulles's absurd remarks show that the United States will use the US-Chiang treaty to carry out this so-called "not constituting war" war of aggression against the Chinese people without any scruples.

    美国对我国人民的严重挑衅行动
    美国和蒋介石卖国集团联合宣布签订所谓“共同安全条约”的谈判已经完成
    【新华社二日讯】美国和蒋介石卖国集团在十二月一日联合发表声明说，美国和蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同安全条约”的谈判已经完成。
    声明表明，这个条约将通过“承认”美国和蒋介石卖国集团对台湾和澎湖列岛有所谓“共同利害关系”的方式，使美国得以无限期侵占台湾和澎湖列岛。声明说，这个条约将规定“经过协议可以把双方管辖下的其他领土也包括进去”。声明又说，这个条约是为了“对付危及条约区域的安全的武装进攻的”。这实际上就是说，美国将积极鼓励和支持蒋介石卖国集团对中国大陆的战争行动，同时阻挠中国人民解放台湾。可是声明却企图欺骗世界舆论，说什么这个条约将是“防御性质”的。
    声明还表明：这个条约将成为美国在太平洋地区建立的军事侵略体系中的一个环节。
    同一天，美国国务卿杜勒斯在记者招待会上声称，美蒋之间的这个条约将在两三天后在华盛顿签字。
    杜勒斯表示，“这个条约使台湾和澎湖列岛处于美国保护之下”，而且使美国取得了“在台湾的基地权利”。杜勒斯还公开鼓励和支持蒋介石卖国集团对中国大陆进行军事挑衅。他狂妄地表示，蒋介石卖国集团如果在进攻大陆中取得任何土地，
  “可以用缔结新协定的办法扩大这一条约而把这种地区包括在内”。
    杜勒斯还公开恫吓说，如果中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和澎湖列岛，美国将“在它自己所选择的地方用它自己所选择的手段进行报复”。杜勒斯为了掩饰美国侵略集团这种在远东制造战争的无耻阴谋，竟然异想天开地说，“战争状态只存在于两个互相承认的政府之间”，“在其中一个未被另一个承认的政府之间的战争，从技术上说并不构成战争”。杜勒斯搬出这种荒唐透顶的话来，就表明美国将利用美蒋条约来对中国人民毫无顾忌地进行这种所谓“并不构成战争”的侵略战争。
