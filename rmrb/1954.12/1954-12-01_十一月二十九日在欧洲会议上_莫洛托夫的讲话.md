Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 30th (TASS):

Comrades!
    With the consent of the governments of the Polish People's Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic, the Soviet government has extended invitations to the governments of European countries and the United States to participate in an all-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. This proposal is made because the current situation in Europe is causing justifiable unease in all peace-loving countries.
    The European situation is developing along a path that endangers peace, because certain Western countries, primarily the United States, as well as Britain and France, have adopted a definite policy of remilitarizing West Germany and drawing it into their military blocs against other European countries.
    This is the main thrust of the agreements drafted in London and signed in Paris on October 23. These agreements have now been submitted for ratification in order to be implemented.
    Now, three Western countries, with the support of other countries in the North Atlantic Group, have formed an open alliance with West German militarists. The London and Paris agreements cannot be evaluated in any other way, because their purpose is to revive German militarism and to bring the remilitarized West Germany into the aggressive North Atlantic Group and the "Western European Union" affiliated to it.
    All of this, in many respects, is a repeat of the policies pursued by Western European countries in the years before the Second World War.
    At that time, the governments of Western European countries not only refused to act jointly with the Soviet Union to restrain German militarists and stop Hitler's aggression, but also, in practice, helped the growth of German militarism. The Soviet government had suggested that countries with a stake in maintaining peace in Europe work together to prevent militarist Germany from launching a new war. However, they refused to accept this suggestion. They intended to use Hitler and Hitler's aggressive plans to achieve their anti-Soviet aims, that is, to turn the spearhead of Hitler's aggression eastward, against the Soviet Union. To this end, they engaged in various collusions with Hitler, in effect making step-by-step concessions to Hitler. They sacrificed Austria; and the sacrifice of Austria was merely a prelude to the shameful Munich deal. It was through the Munich deal that the Hitlerite invaders enslaved Czechoslovakia. They also indulged the German militarists in attacking Poland, although the Polish government at that time had received so-called "guarantees" from the Western European powers.
    The German militarists launched the Second World War. Everyone already knows the names of those major war criminals who were tried by the Nuremberg Tribunal after the war.
    But it must not be forgotten that the governments of the Western European countries, which adopted an uncompromising attitude towards the Soviet Union before the outbreak of the war, bore a great responsibility for failing to curb Hitler's aggression. They were particularly responsible for this because they refused to act jointly with the Soviet Union to prevent German militarism from dragging the people of European countries, and then other countries, into the Second World War through the collective efforts of European countries.
    The Second World War, which brought endless disasters to the people of Europe, ended only nine years ago. We must not forget that tens of millions of people lost their lives, and we must not forget the infinite grief that the war brought to orphans and widows. The material destruction and the losses suffered by the people of all countries were unparalleled. The disastrous consequences of this war are still clearly felt today. Countless cities and villages in the Soviet Union, Poland, France, Britain, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, the Netherland, and other European countries, after being destroyed by the fascist occupation forces, have still not recovered to this day. Even Germany itself is one of the countries that suffered the most.
    Today, we must recall all this. We must constantly think of the years of the Second World War, which passed not long ago, and strive to shatter the evil plans of those militarists who are now plotting a new world war before our very eyes.
    It must be mentioned that, during the Second World War, Western countries and the Soviet Union, as well as other countries that were attacked, formed a powerful anti-Hitler alliance, guaranteeing victory over the aggressors. Is there any fact more convincing than this? This fact proves that, on the issue of resisting German aggression and maintaining peace in Europe, the interests of all European countries with a stake in peace are consistent, including the Soviet Union, France, Britain, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and other countries. Not long ago, those who instigated and colluded in fascist aggression against peaceful countries in Eastern and Western Europe are now frantically active on the stage of West Germany. Can we close our eyes to this fact?
    It is clear that guaranteeing European security is inextricably linked to correctly resolving the German question. European security cannot be truly guaranteed if the German question is not resolved in a way that serves the interests of all peace-loving countries in Europe, as well as the interests of the peaceful forces in Germany. That is to say, the long-term failure to resolve the German question is not in line with the goal of guaranteeing peace and security in Europe.
    The plan now proposed by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France is to remilitarize West Germany and bring it into existing or newly established imperialist military blocs. The danger this plan poses to peace in Europe is quite obvious.
    To avoid this danger, and to truly promote the resolution of the German question and guarantee peace and security in Europe, the Soviet Union proposes abandoning these plans and reaching an agreement based on the following fundamental provisions:
    First, the revival of German militarism, which launched the First and Second World Wars, must never be allowed. The resolution of the German question must be sought firmly and patiently, ultimately on the basis of an agreement, first and foremost on the basis of an agreement among the four powers that bear a particularly heavy responsibility for resolving the German question and therefore also bear a particularly heavy responsibility for guaranteeing peace and security in Europe.
    Second, a European collective security system should be established with the participation of all European countries that are concerned with maintaining and consolidating peace (regardless of their national and social systems), and for this purpose, the Soviet Union's draft "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security" and other countries' proposals on this issue should be studied very carefully.
    These two proposals of the Soviet government are closely linked, and there is nothing in them that violates the interests of any European or non-European country. Reaching an agreement on these proposals cannot be considered a simple and easy matter, but no one can say that countries that yearn for peace and security in Europe have no possibility of reaching an agreement on these proposals.
    These two proposals of the Soviet Union are fundamentally different from the agreements adopted at the Paris Conference. Both of these proposals, whether the proposal to prevent the revival of German militarism or the proposal to establish a European collective security system, have only one common goal: to guarantee the maintenance and consolidation of peace in Europe.
    However, the Paris agreements are based on a different goal. The Paris agreements start from the principle of opposing European collective security and serve the plan of remilitarizing West Germany and bringing it into the military blocs of certain Western countries. Therefore, these agreements do not serve the interests of maintaining and consolidating peace, but pursue the opposite goal. The starting point of the Paris agreements is to pit some European countries against other European countries, provoke divisions between them, and continue to expand armaments, and expanding armaments is only for the purpose of planning new aggression and launching new wars.
    The Soviet government explained its opposition to the Paris agreements in its notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on October 23 and November 13.
    No matter how much the drafters of the Paris agreements, which aim to revive German militarism, try to play tricks, they cannot hide the fundamental fact that the Paris agreements are a threat to peace in Europe and are therefore incompatible with the requirements of guaranteeing the security of European countries.
    Can the Paris agreements resolve the German question or help to resolve it? Our answer is: no, they cannot.
    Not only can such agreements not be used to achieve this goal, but if such agreements are implemented, they will create major obstacles to resolving the most pressing issue, namely, the restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis. Nothing hinders the restoration of German unity more than the Paris agreements to remilitarize West Germany.
    Everyone knows that, according to the Paris agreements, an armed force of 500,000 to 520,000 men is to be established in West Germany in the near future. The Bonn ruling clique is now openly declaring that, after the planned corps is established, the West German army will increase several times over. There is a certain basis for saying this.
    There is already a police force of about 200,000 men in West Germany, in addition to 250,000 men in so-called "service teams" and other militarized auxiliary organizations. Including the more than 500,000 West German troops established under the Paris agreements, West Germany will soon actually have about one million troops.
    In addition, various militarist organizations in West Germany, such as the "Soldiers' Association" and the "Tradition Association," have expanded extensively in recent years. Those participating in these groups are soldiers from various corps of the former Hitler army who have blood debts and atrocities during the war. The "Soldiers' Association" and the "Tradition Association," composed of people who participated in the "Fuhrer Guard Division," "Fuhrer Escort Division," "Goering Tank Division," Hitler's SS, etc., are doing everything possible to maintain fascist militarist traditions. The number of people participating in these militarist organizations has already reached two million.
    All this shows that, although the Paris agreements declare the establishment of a 500,000-man West German army, this does not tell the whole truth. Once this agreement is implemented, West Germany will establish at least one million troops in a short period of time. In addition, there are the two million people now in militarist organizations, whose members are those who participated in the Hitler army in the past and still support the fascist traditions of Hitlerism. As soon as the Paris agreements begin to be implemented, German militarists will be able to mobilize these millions of people and attempt to use them as cannon fodder again in order to launch new aggression, carry out revenge, and occupy other countries' territories.
    The Paris agreements, in fact, give West German militarists the right to revive the German General Staff, and this consequence will soon be manifested.
    At the same time, this agreement enables West German militarists to develop military industries without restriction.
    Krupp, Yabs, Changen, Tingkabach, and other major figures who organized the militarization of the German economy on the eve of the Second World War are now playing a leading role in the remilitarization of West Germany. As for the extent of West German remilitarization, it can be seen from the following material: in the six years from 1933 to 1939, Hitler spent 90 billion marks on expanding armaments and preparing for war, while the Bonn ruling clique currently plans to spend more than 100 billion marks on military expenditures in the next three years alone. The United States has already begun to supply West Germany with weapons worth billions of dollars. In this matter, the situation is now the same as on the eve of the Second World War. West German militarists are currently receiving material support from the largest monopoly capital in the United States, and the largest monopoly capital in the United States has already obtained considerable profits from transactions related to the remilitarization of West Germany. Therefore, it is not accidental that the monopoly capital in the United States, which is linked to the wealthiest and most aggressive West German groups and is manufacturing weapons for the re-established West German army, has recently strengthened its influence on American policy.
    The policy of remilitarization will further increase the military and revanchist forces in West Germany that are currently intensifying their attacks on the democratic rights of residents. The situation thus formed primarily threatens the rights of the working class and their living standards. The Paris agreements directly contribute to this situation. There is not a single word in the Paris agreements about guaranteeing the basic democratic freedoms of the West German people, but it is openly stipulated that new so-called "emergency" laws can be implemented once the movement of the people against the revival of the "Defense Force" grows, or once the struggle of the working class to defend its own rights and to improve its economic situation intensifies.
    The Third Congress of the West German Trade Union Confederation was held in October. The unions participating in the congress have more than six million members and constitute the largest mass organization of the working class in West Germany. This congress firmly opposed the plan to remilitarize West Germany. The congress declared that the implementation of these plans "will seriously hinder the easing of international tensions, damage the opportunities for German reunification," and that, for West Germany, "rearmament will mean the danger of establishing a militarist bureaucratic state, which will mean the end of the workers' movement's efforts to establish political, social, and economic democracy."
    This resolution of the West German Trade Union Confederation proves that the remilitarization of West Germany is against the will of the working class and against the will of the majority of the German people, and that the working people of West Germany are firmly opposed to the remilitarization of West Germany. However, the rulers of West Germany do not consider this. They are disregarding the will of their own people and are using all kinds of pressure to prepare for a new war, making West Germany completely serve militarists and revanchist elements.
    We see that West Germany is turning into an aggressive militarist state, and it seems very likely that it will once again become a major breeding ground for war in Europe. The leaders of the Bonn state do not hide their aggressive plans against the people of other European countries.
    It was none other than the current West German Chancellor Adenauer who insisted on remilitarizing West Germany. As early as March 1952, he advocated such a bellicose plan: "The rearmament of West Germany should become a preparation for establishing a new order in Eastern Europe."
    If it was Hitler who talked about "establishing a new order in Eastern Europe" in the past, then after the bankruptcy of Hitlerism, it is Adenauer who is talking about this.
    The words of Bonn ministers like Seabohm, Kaiser, and Halstein, Hitler's generals like Falkenhausen and Kesselring, and many others prove that revanchist elements and those who advocate seizing foreign territories no longer conceal their aggressive aims and plans.
    If the official leaders of France and Britain, as well as other countries in the North Atlantic Group, try their best to conceal from their own people the facts that prove that European peace is in danger, or to conceal the aggressive nature of these facts, then this will only increase the responsibility that these figures should bear for the consequences of the Paris agreements. The sooner this deception of the people of all countries is exposed, the better it will be for the cause of peace and security of the people of European countries.
    The ruling groups in Britain, France and the United States are misleading public opinion by saying that the Paris agreements provide "guarantees" and that this agreement will prevent possible aggression by a remilitarized West Germany. It is no accident that no one believes this notorious "guarantee."
    Everyone knows that the Treaty of Versailles greatly restricted the revival of German military power. According to the Treaty of Versailles, the total number of German troops should not exceed 100,000. Several types of weapons were completely prohibited from use by the German army, such as airplanes, tanks, and heavy artillery. There were also considerable restrictions on German military production. Germany also undertook a formal obligation not to commit aggression against other European countries. Formal guarantees were also put forward on the part of Britain and France, such as guarantees to Poland and Czechoslovakia. Britain and France even signed non-aggression declarations with Hitler's Germany on the eve of the outbreak of the Second World War.
    What were the results of all these activities? The results are known to all.
    The German militarists at that time mainly relied on the help of American monopoly capital to rebuild their military strength, and only twenty years after the end of the First World War, they once again dragged Europe, and then the whole world, into a war of unprecedented bloodshed and destruction in world history.
    Under current conditions, the remilitarization of West Germany is even more dangerous than before. It is enough to mention the following point: the West German army has all kinds of weapons, and it is even allowed to use atomic weapons. In this case, it is effortless to use the hands of those militarist thugs to launch an atomic war. These militarist thugs have been trained in Hitler's war crimes and have killed millions of innocent peaceful people in their death concentration camps, gas chambers, Maidanek concentration camps, Auschwitz concentration camps, and many other killing places. Can we forget these demons who shed blood and tried to destroy entire nations and the people of entire countries?
    Since what is currently being carried out is not only the remilitarization of West Germany, but also the joining of West Germany into a military bloc against other European countries, the adverse consequences of this situation should not be underestimated. That is to say, German militarists and the aggressive groups of certain Western countries are openly colluding to plot new war adventures. German militarists and revanchist elements, possessing the resources of West Germany and obtaining corresponding support from the aggressive groups of Western countries, especially the United States, are not without reason to expect that this will guarantee them a military advantage in Western Europe in a short period of time, and then rely on this advantage to tear up various agreements that bind them.
    The Soviet government has drawn attention to the fact: the Paris agreements are incompatible with the 1944 Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance and with the 1942 Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance for Post-War Cooperation. Like the Potsdam Agreement, which was also signed by the US government, these two treaties stipulate that France, Great Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union take joint measures to prevent new aggression by Germany and prevent the revival of German militarism.
    The Paris agreements were not only passed without the participation of the Soviet Union, but its spearhead is openly directed at the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries in Europe. Such moves cannot but undermine international trust, and cannot but make the policies of those governments that violate treaties and agreements lose credibility.
    The ruling groups in the United States, Britain, and France, while restoring German militarism, insist that they are doing so for the "interests of West European defense." The Soviet government has repeatedly pointed out how unfounded and hypocritical this statement is, and how contrary it is to the actual situation.
    This can be seen from the following facts: none of the countries participating in the Paris agreements have been threatened by any aggression or attack in the past or present. None of these countries have said in the past, and there is no reason to say now, that it faces such a danger. It is clear, therefore, that the argument of so-called "defensive interests" is merely to justify their actions in the eyes of the public.
    Since the Paris agreements, like other military plans of the North Atlantic Group, cannot be justified by the hypocritical excuse of "defensive interests," it is not difficult to understand the true purpose of the Paris agreements. It is quite clear that absorbing the remilitarized West Germany into military blocs has the same purpose as establishing many military bases on territories near the borders of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies.
    It must be admitted that this is not accidental: what inevitably comes with all of this is the demand to expand armaments, constantly issue aggressive remarks, and clamor that relations with other countries must rely on strength, and must rely on further expanding armed forces. Do we need more arguments to prove that the Paris agreements, like other plans of the North Atlantic Group, do not serve the cause of peace, but aim to prepare for a new war?
    The Paris agreements show that the aggressors in the United States, Britain, and France are hostile to the interests of restoring German unity and to the entire interests of the German people. Turning West Germany into a militarist state makes it impossible for West Germany to merge with the peace-loving German Democratic Republic into a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany. What these aggressors are interested in is only how to use West Germany to achieve their goals. Therefore, everything they do is devoted to finally dispelling the desire to restore German unity based on democratic and peaceful principles, which is precisely what the Soviet Union is striving to achieve. They need to revive German militarism in order to: realize collusion with German militarists on this basis, and use the military bloc newly established by them and with the participation of remilitarized Germany to strengthen various pressures on the Soviet Union and other European countries that have not participated in their military bloc. This is what they call a "policy of strength."
    It seems that it should have been understood long ago that no threats can intimidate the Soviet people and the democratic countries that have seized power by the working class allied with the working peasants and are victoriously advancing in the cause of socialist construction. If such attempts failed in the past, then now, when the great Soviet Union and the people's democracies are filled with unprecedented confidence in their own status and in the future achievements of socialist construction, any such aggressive plan is even more hopeless. There is no force in the world that can turn back the wheel of history.
    The Soviet Union opposes any plan to revive German militarism, opposes any conspiracy to use one part or another of Germany for the benefit of any military bloc, and advocates that France, Britain, and the United States work with the Soviet Union to resolve the German question. To this end, considerable difficulties need to be overcome, and first of all, the four powers must reach an agreement on the issue of restoring German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis. And this requires reaching an agreement on the issue of holding free all-German elections, so as to elect an all-German parliament on the basis of this election and establish an all-German democratic government.
    Is it possible for the four powers to reach such an agreement on the German issue that not only conforms to the interests of European security, but also conforms to the national interests of the German people? The Soviet government believes that it is possible to reach such an agreement. As long as the four powers do not adopt plans to remilitarize one part or another of Germany, but instead strive to reach a consensus on the issue of restoring Germany into a peaceful, democratic, and unified country, it is entirely possible to reach such an agreement.
    For this reason, the Soviet government once again proposed on October 23 to convene a four-power conference to discuss the issues of restoring German unity and holding free all-German elections for this purpose, as well as the issue of guaranteeing European collective security, because these two tasks are extremely closely linked. However, it has been more than a month now, and we have not yet received a response to this proposal. On the other hand, efforts are being made to accelerate the remilitarization of West Germany, the purpose of which is clearly to hinder the four powers from reaching an agreement on the issue of restoring German unity.
    Some believe that the experience of the Berlin Conference shows that it is impossible to expect the four countries to reach an agreement on the issue of restoring German unity. We cannot agree with this view.
    It should be pointed out here that the obstacle to reaching an agreement at that time was the plan of the United States, Britain, and France to establish the "European Defense Community," because the main purpose of this group was to revive German militarism, which was of course rejected by the Soviet Union.
    However, since the "European Defense Community" plan went bankrupt under the pressure of public opinion, the issue of reaching an agreement on the restoration of German unity has had more favorable preconditions. Of course, the truly favorable precondition is that it can only be discussed after any plan to revive German militarism has been abandoned. Only then will there truly be the necessary preconditions to specifically study the conditions for conducting free all-German elections and to study the proposals on this issue that the four countries have already put forward or are prepared to put forward.
    The Soviet Union strives to reach an agreement with the United States, Britain, and France on the German issue, especially on the issue of unifying Germany. If all the actions of the four countries help to promote the rapprochement between East Germany and West Germany, and try to make the unified Germany a truly peaceful and democratic country, then this agreement can be reached.
    As early as the first few years after the end of the European war, the United States, Britain, and France divided Germany into east and west. Now everyone can see the purpose of the Western countries' determined pursuit of a policy of dividing Germany at that time. As a result of their implementation of this policy of division, the West German regime fell into the hands of German militarists, and now the aggressive groups of Western countries are colluding with these militarists to establish a military alliance against peace-loving countries in Europe. The United States, Britain, and France are now embarking on the rearmament of West Germany, dragging West Germany into their military bloc, pitting West Germany against East Germany, and pitting Western European countries against other countries in Europe. This road leads not only to a German civil war, but also to a new world war.
    Preparations are now being stepped up to ratify the Paris agreements. The aggressive groups of Western countries are doing everything possible to implement the above agreements as soon as possible, thereby openly reviving West German militarism and dragging West Germany into military blocs.
    This means that the ratification and implementation of the Paris agreements will greatly complicate the entire international situation.
    Once the remilitarized West Germany joins the North Atlantic Military Group and the Western European military alliance that is being established, the aggressive nature of the military groups established by the United States, Britain, and France will be greatly strengthened.
    Because the number of countries joining aggressive military groups will increase the number of armies, air forces, and other armed forces, especially because these military groups will regard the reviving West German militarism as their ally, many other countries in Europe will have to take effective self-defense measures to prevent violations.
    The situation caused by the policies of Western countries cannot but further intensify the arms race and increase the armies and military budgets of European countries, which will greatly increase the tax burden and other burdens on the people of various European countries.
    All this shows that European peace cannot be guaranteed if the policy of establishing military groups of some European countries to oppose other European countries is not abandoned.
    The establishment of such military groups will lead to new wars, and European countries must unite their forces to lay the foundation for European collective security to replace these groups. Establishing a European collective security system is the road to maintaining and consolidating peace in Europe.
    As early as the Four-Power Conference in Berlin earlier this year, the Soviet Union proposed discussing the draft basic principles of the "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security" that it had put forward. Although this draft did not receive the necessary support from France, Britain, and the United States, the issue of establishing an effective European collective security system has since been the focus of attention of the people of European countries.
    The draft treaty stipulates that all European countries that recognize the purpose of the treaty and undertake the obligations stipulated in the treaty, regardless of their social systems, may participate in the treaty. The draft treaty also stipulates that, before the reunification of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany may participate in the treaty on an equal footing; after the reunification of Germany, the unified Germany may also participate in the treaty. The draft treaty also stipulates that the contracting parties have the obligation of non-aggression and non-threat of force against each other; the contracting parties should use peaceful means in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations to resolve all disputes that may arise between the contracting parties. When one or several contracting parties are subjected to armed aggression in Europe, each contracting party has the obligation to do its best to help one or several countries subjected to such aggression, including the use of armed forces to restore and maintain international peace and security in Europe. The contracting parties may not participate in or conclude some kind of alliance, treaty or any agreement that violates the purpose of the European collective security treaty.
    The Soviet government believes that this draft of the basic principles of the All-European Treaty, or other similar drafts, can be used as a basis to establish a collective security system that can truly guarantee the peace and security of the European people.
    While proposing the above draft treaty, the Soviet government also announced that it was prepared to study other suggestions that could promote an agreement between all relevant countries. However, it must be pointed out that although the Soviet government has repeatedly suggested that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France begin to study issues that are so important to the cause of peace, the governments of the above three countries have always avoided this issue.
    Everyone knows that the initial objections to the draft proposed by the Soviet government involved the following two points: 1. the issue of the United States participating in the European collective security system; 2. the Soviet government's attitude towards the North Atlantic Alliance. However, when the Soviet government stated in March this year that it supported the United States participating in the All-European Treaty and that it was willing to jointly consider with the relevant governments the issue of the Soviet Union participating in the North Atlantic Treaty, the governments of the three Western countries began to look for new excuses to refuse to jointly study the issue of establishing a European collective security system.
    Nine months ago, the Soviet government put forward proposals on establishing a European collective security system at the Berlin Conference. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France did not accept this proposal. Four months ago, the Soviet government proposed convening an all-European conference to discuss this issue, and then proposed convening a four-country conference to preliminarily discuss this issue. However, these proposals of the Soviet Union were not accepted by these three Western countries either.
    Due to the recent emergence of increasingly intense measures aimed at quickly ratifying the Paris agreements, which are diametrically opposed to the principles of European collective security, the Soviet government, after conducting relevant consultations with the Polish and Czechoslovak governments, proposed convening an all-European conference on November 29 to discuss this issue. We now know that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have also not accepted this proposal.
    It can be seen that the Soviet Union has suggested to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France three times this year to jointly discuss the urgent and very mature issue of European collective security, but these suggestions have never received the support of the above-mentioned countries.
    The governments of the United States, Britain, and France dare not directly reject the proposal to establish a European collective security system. This is obviously because they cannot but take into account the increasingly strong desire of the people of European countries to consolidate European peace and security. However, the above-mentioned countries' governments are doing everything possible to obstruct the establishment of European collective security.
    It cannot but be pointed out that it is also not accidental that the governments of these countries not only avoid discussing the All-European Treaty draft on European collective security proposed by the Soviet Union, but also do not put forward any of their own suggestions on this issue. Their current plans are embodied in the Paris agreements, the purpose of which is not to guarantee European collective security and peace, but to establish a military bloc that includes the remilitarized West Germany, a group that will only deepen the danger of war in Europe and further intensify the international situation.
    Everyone knows that an aggressive North Atlantic Group military organization has been established in Europe for several years. This organization has its own staff, which formulates plans to launch a new war in Europe and establishes many air and naval bases in places close to the borders of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. This aggressive group also has a commander-in-chief—an American general—who likes to frequently and brazenly issue bellicose remarks.
    The Paris agreements mark a particularly dangerous new stage in the planning of a new war in Europe. The people of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the German Democratic Republic, who are sending representatives to this meeting, understand that not only must they be particularly vigilant about the current plans of the Western imperialist countries, but also take practical steps to ensure their own security. The people of Europe and other countries outside Europe should also understand this.
    Representatives of the People's Republic of China are attending our meeting, and the participation of the People's Republic of China in resolving important international issues is in the interests of all peace-loving countries. The development of friendly cooperation between European countries and the People's Republic of China will help to consolidate European peace and world peace.
    Because someone has recently prepared to ratify the Paris agreements and prepare to implement these agreements, peace-loving European countries cannot only take the measures they have taken so far to defend themselves. This issue is primarily related to the countries attending this meeting. Of course, it also relates to other peace-loving countries that are unwilling to become pawns and accomplices in planning and launching a new war in Europe.
    In order to firmly guarantee their own security, peace-loving European countries should unite their forces and greatly strengthen this force in the event that the Paris agreements are ratified and implemented. To this end, it is necessary to fully prepare to take some measures appropriate to the current situation to strengthen defensive forces. This requires the countries participating in this meeting to take joint measures in organizing armed forces and establishing command headquarters, and to take other measures to reliably protect the peaceful labor of the people of our countries, guarantee the inviolability of their borders, and prevent possible aggression.
    The Soviet government is convinced that the countries sending representatives to this meeting are unanimously willing to promote the consolidation of peace and the collective security of European countries (regardless of their social systems and national systems).
    However, peace-loving countries cannot but take into account that aggressive groups in certain Western countries are trying their best to undermine the establishment of a European collective security system. In recent times, they have attempted to step up the establishment of military groups that endanger the cause of peace, to the point of wanting to make German militarism, which was revived with their help, their main military pillar. Precisely because of this, we should not ignore or underestimate the following situation: the ratification of the Paris agreements requires the adoption of new and major measures to guarantee the due defensive power of peace-loving countries and to maintain and consolidate peace in Europe.
    The Paris agreements, which were hastily drafted by the governments of certain Western countries, cannot receive the genuine support of the people of all countries, because the purpose of the Paris agreements is to oppose the interests of the people of all countries, and first of all to oppose the interests of peace. The Paris agreements reflect the aggressive plans and military-political conspiracies that the three Western countries hurriedly made at the London Conference and the Paris Conference not long ago. The struggle against the Paris agreements has only just begun.
    As for our proposals, their purpose is to guarantee European peace and collective security, their purpose is to replace the dangerous conspiracy to revive German militarism that endangers the cause of peace, and to reach international agreements on the German issue in accordance with the interests of universal peace and the interests of the German people themselves. These suggestions have received the full support of the people of Europe and countries all over the world.
    The current European National Conference clearly shows this. Therefore, this meeting will undoubtedly be an important step in establishing a European collective security system, which is supported by the people of Europe and countries all over the world, and it is of utmost importance to prevent a new world war.
    The people of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, as well as other countries that are friendly to us, look forward to the future with confidence.

### 十一月二十九日在欧洲会议上  莫洛托夫的讲话

    十一月二十九日在欧洲会议上
    莫洛托夫的讲话同志们！
    苏联政府征得波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国的政府的同意，向欧洲各国以及美国的政府发出邀请，邀请它们参加讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的全欧会议。所以提出这个建议，是因为目前的欧洲局势引起了所有爱好和平的国家应有的不安。
    欧洲局势正在顺着危害和平的道路发展，因为某些西方国家，首先是美国以及英、法两国，采取了一种确定的方针：使西德重新军国主义化，把西德拉入它们的反对欧洲其他国家的军事集团。
    这就是在伦敦草拟而在十月二十三日在巴黎签订的协定的主旨。现在，这些协定已经交付批准，以便付诸实施。
    现在，三个西方国家在北大西洋集团其他国家的支持下，同西德军国主义者结成了公开的联盟。不可能对伦敦和巴黎协定作别种评价，因为这些协定的目的在于复活德国军国主义，并且使重新军国主义化的西德加入侵略性的北大西洋集团和附属于这个集团的“西欧联盟”。
    所有这一切，在许多方面都是重复西欧国家在第二次世界大战以前的年月中所执行的政策。
    当时，西欧国家的政府不仅拒绝同苏联共同行动，以便约束德国军国主义分子和制止希特勒的侵略，而且在实际上助长德国军国主义的成长。苏联政府曾经建议同维护欧洲和平有利害关系的国家一齐努力阻止军国主义的德国发动新战争。然而它们拒不接受这个建议。它们打算利用希特勒和希特勒的侵略计划来达到自己的反苏目的，这就是要把希特勒的侵略矛头转向东方，对着苏联。为了这个目的，它们同希特勒进行了种种勾结，实际上也就是对希特勒一步一步地退让。它们牺牲了奥地利；而牺牲奥地利只不过是可耻的慕尼黑买卖勾当的前奏。希特勒入侵者就是通过慕尼黑买卖勾当而奴役了捷克斯洛伐克的。它们还放纵德国军国主义者进攻波兰，虽然当时的波兰政府曾经得到西欧当权人物的所谓“保证”。
    德国军国主义者发动了第二次世界大战。大家都已经知道战后受到纽伦堡法庭审判的那些主要战犯的名字。
    但是不能忘记：在大战爆发前对苏联采取誓不两立的态度的西欧国家当时的政府，对不制止希特勒侵略负有极大的责任。它们对这一点要特别负责，因为它们拒绝和苏联共同行动，通过欧洲国家的集体努力来制止德国军国主义把欧洲国家的人民，接着又把其他国家，拖进第二次世界大战。
    使欧洲人民受到无穷灾难的第二次世界大战结束了才不过九年。我们不能忘记数千万人丧失了生命，不能忘记战争给孤儿寡妇带来的无限悲痛。战争给各国造成的物质破坏和各国人民的损失是无比的。这次战争造成的恶果直到今天还使人清楚地感觉到。苏联和波兰、法国和英国、南斯拉夫和捷克斯洛伐克、比利时和荷兰以及欧洲其他一些国家境内的无数城市和乡村遭受法西斯占领军破坏后，到现在还远没有恢复起来。就是德国本身，也是受害最大的国家之一。
    今天我们必须追述这一切。我们必须时时想到才过去不久的第二次世界大战的年代，努力粉碎今天就在我们眼前策划新世界大战的那些军国主义者的罪恶计划。
    不能不谈到，在第二次世界大战中，西方国家和苏联以及受到进攻的其他国家组成了强大的反希特勒同盟，保证了对侵略者的胜利。难道还有比这个事实更具有说服力的事实吗？这个事实证明：在反抗德国侵略和维护欧洲和平的问题上，同和平有利害关系的欧洲一切国家的利益是一致的，这包括苏联和法国、英国和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫以及其他国家在内。不久以前还是对东欧和西欧的和平国家进行法西斯侵略的主使者和同谋者，现在又在西德的舞台上疯狂地活动起来了。难道可以闭着眼睛不看到这个事实吗？
    由此可见，保障欧洲安全同正确地解决德国问题有着不可分割的联系，如果不设法按照既符合欧洲所有爱好和平的国家的利益、又符合德国和平力量的利益来解决德国问题，就无法真正保障欧洲安全。这也就是说，德国问题长期延不解决，是不符合保障欧洲和平和安全的目的的。
    美国、英国和法国的政府现在提出的计划，是要使西德重新军国主义化，并且要把西德拉入现有的或者是新成立的帝国主义军事集团。这个计划对欧洲和平的危害性是十分明显的。
    为了避免这种危害，为了真正地促进德国问题的解决和保障欧洲和平和安全，苏联提议放弃这些计划，并且根据下列基本条款达成协议：
    一、绝不允许发动过第一次和第二次世界大战的德国军国主义复活，最后在取得协议的基础上，首先是在对解决德国问题负有特别重大的责任、因而也对保障欧洲的和平和安全负有特别重大责任的四国取得协议的基础上，坚定和耐心地谋求德国问题的解决。
    二、建立有一切关心维护和巩固和平的欧洲国家（不论它们的国家制度和社会制度如何）参加的欧洲集体安全体系，并且为了这个目的而非常仔细地研究苏联的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案及其他国家可能提出来的关于这个问题的建议。
    苏联政府这两个建议是密切地连在一起的，其中没有任何东西是违反任何欧洲国家和非欧洲国家的利益的。就这些建议达成协议不能认为是简单和轻易的事情，但是谁也不能说，渴望欧洲和平和安全的各国没有可能就这些建议达成协议。
    苏联这两个建议根本不同于在巴黎会议上通过的那些协定。这两个建议，无论是制止复活德国军国主义的建议，或者是关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议，只有一个共同的目的：保证维护和巩固欧洲的和平。
    而作为巴黎协定的基础的却是另外的目的。巴黎协定是以反对欧洲集体安全原则为出发点，并且是替西德重新军国主义化和把西德拉入某些西方国家的军事集团的计划服务的。因此，这些协定并不是为维护和巩固和平的利益服务的，是追求着完全相反的目的的。巴黎协定的出发点是：使一些欧洲国家和另外一些欧洲国家对立，挑起它们之间的分歧，并且继续扩充军备，而扩充军备又只是为了打算进行新侵略，发动新战争。
    苏联政府在十月二十三日致美国、英国和法国政府的照会中以及在十一月十三日的照会中，说明了它反对巴黎协定的态度。
    指望复活德国军国主义的巴黎协定拟订者无论怎样耍花样，也不能够掩饰这个基本事实：巴黎协定对于维护欧洲和平是一种威胁，因而是和保障欧洲各国安全的要求互不相容的。
    巴黎协定能解决德国问题或者能对解决德国问题有所帮助吗？我们的回答是：不，不能。
    这种协定不仅不能用来达到这个目的，而且如果实现这种协定，就会给解决最迫切的问题，也就是在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国统一的问题，造成主要障碍。目前妨碍恢复德国统一的，莫过于使西德重新军国主义化的巴黎协定了。
    大家知道，根据巴黎协定，最近期间要在西德建立起五十万至五十二万人的武装部队。波恩统治集团现在公开地宣布，在计划中的兵团建立起来之后，西德的军队就会增加好几倍。说这种话，是有它的一定的根据的。
    现在在西德已经有人数约二十万的警察部队，除此以外，还有二十五万人的所谓“服务队”及其他军国主义化的辅助组织。把根据巴黎协定所建立的五十多万西德军队计算在内，西德最近实际上就会有约一百万人的部队。
    此外，近几年来西德的形形色色的军国主义组织如“军人联合会”和“传统协会”都广泛地扩张，参加这些团体的都是在战争期间有血债和兽行的前希特勒军队各兵团的军人。由参加过“元首近卫师”、“元首保卫师”、“戈林坦克师”、希特勒党卫军等等部队的人组成的“军人联合会”和“传统协会”都在千方百计地维护法西斯军国主义传统。参加这些军国主义组织的人数已经有二百万人。
    这一切说明：巴黎协定虽然宣布要建立五十万西德军队，但是这还没有说明全部真相。这个协定一旦实现，西德就会在短时间内至少建立起一百万军队来。此外还要加上现在军国主义组织中的两百万人，这些组织的成员都是那些过去参加希特勒军队而现在仍然拥护希特勒主义的法西斯传统的人。只要巴黎协定一开始实施，德国军国主义者就能调遣这几百万人，再企图利用他们去当炮灰，以便发动新侵略、进行报复和占领别国领土。
    巴黎协定事实上使西德军国主义者有权复活德国参谋总部，这个后果很快就要表现出来。
    同时，这个协定使西德军国主义者能够毫无限制地发展军事工业。
    克虏伯、亚布斯、昌根、丁卡巴赫等这样一些在第二次世界大战前夕组织德国经济军事化的主要人物，现在又在西德的重新军国主义化中起着领导作用。至于西德重新军国主义化的程度如何，可以从下列一个材料中看出来：从一九三三至一九三九年之间的六年中，希特勒用于扩军备战的开支为九百亿马克，而波恩统治集团目前计划仅仅在今后三年内用于军事开支的数目就在一千亿马克以上。美国已经开始供给西德价值几十亿美元的武器。在这件事情上，现在的情形也和第二次世界大战前夕一样，西德军国主义者目前正在获得美国最大的垄断资本的物质上的支持，美国最大的垄断资本已经从有关西德重新军国主义化的交易中获得不少利润。因此，美国那些和最富有侵略性的西德集团有联系、而且正在为重新建立的西德军队制造武器的垄断资本最近日益加强对美国政策的影响，实在不是偶然的。
    重新军国主义化的方针会使目前日益加紧进攻居民的民主权利的西德军国主义和复仇主义势力进一步增长。因此而形成的局面首先威胁着工人阶级的权利和他们的生活水平。巴黎协定直接促成这种情况。巴黎协定中没有一句话谈到保障西德人民的基本民主自由，而公然规定一旦人民反对“国防军”复活的运动增长，或者一旦工人阶级争取自身权利和争取改善经济情况的斗争加强时，可以实行新的所谓“非常时期”法。
    西德工会联合会第三次代表大会已经在十月间举行。参加大会的工会拥有六百多万会员，并且构成西德最大规模的工人阶级群众组织。这次代表大会坚决反对西德重新军国主义化的计划。大会宣布，实现这些计划“将严重地妨碍国际紧张局势的缓和，损害德国重新统一的机会”，对西德来说，“重新武装将意味着建立军国主义官僚国家的危险，而这将意味着工人运动为建立政治的、社会的和经济的民主而进行的努力到了末日”。
    西德工会联合会这个决议证明：西德重新军国主义化是违背工人阶级的意志的，是违背大多数德国人民的意志的，西德的劳动人民正在坚决反对西德重新军国主义化。但是，西德的统治者不考虑这一点。他们不顾本国人民的意志，正在使用各种各样的压力来准备新战争，使西德完全为军国主义者和复仇主义分子服务。
    我们看到，西德正在变成一个侵略的军国主义的国家，眼看它很可能会又一次成为欧洲的主要战争温床。波恩国家的首脑人物并不隐讳他们的反对欧洲其他国家人民的侵略计划。
    不是别人，正是西德现任的总理阿登纳坚持要使西德重新军国主义化。他早在一九五二年三月就鼓吹这样一个好战的计划：“重新武装西德应当成为建立东欧新秩序的准备。”
    如果说过去是希特勒在谈“建立东欧新秩序”，那么在希特勒主义破产后，就是阿登纳在谈这一点了。
    像席堡姆、凯撒、哈尔斯坦之流的波恩部长，像法肯豪森、凯塞林之流的希特勒的将军以及其他许多人的言论证明，复仇主义分子和主张侵占外国领土的人已经不再掩饰他们的侵略目的和计划了。
    如果法国和英国以及北大西洋集团的其他国家的官方领袖人物竭力在本国人民面前隐瞒那些证明欧洲和平遭到危险的事实，或者掩饰这些事实的侵略性质，那就只会加重这些人物对巴黎协定的后果应负的责任。对各国人民的这种骗局被揭穿得越快，对于欧洲各国人民的和平与安全的事业就越有好处。
    英国、法国和美国的领导集团正在迷惑舆论，说什么巴黎协定提供了“保证”，这个协定据说可以预防重新军国主义化的西德可能进行的侵略。谁也不相信这种臭名远扬的“保证”，这不是偶然的。
    大家知道，凡尔赛和约对于德国军事力量的复活有极大的限制。根据凡尔赛和约，德国全部军队的人数不得超过十万人。有几种武器完全禁止德国军队使用的，如飞机、坦克和重炮。对德国的军事生产也有相当大的限制。德国还承担不得对欧洲其他国家进行侵略的正式义务。在英国和法国方面也提出了正式保证，例如对波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的保证。英国和法国甚至在第二次世界大战爆发的前夕还同希特勒德国签订了互不侵犯宣言。
    这一切活动究竟有什么样的结果呢？结果是大家都知道的。
    当时的德国军国主义者主要是靠美国垄断资本的帮助来重建自己的军事力量的，并且在第一次世界大战结束后才不过二十年的时间，就又一次把欧洲，跟着把全世界，拖进了世界史上空前未有的流血和毁灭的战争中。
    在目前条件下，西德重新军国主义化比以前更加具有危险性。只要提到下面这一点就够了：西德军队拥有一切种类的武器，甚至准许它使用原子武器。在这种情况下，要藉那些军国主义暴徒的手来发动原子战争是不费力的。这些军国主义暴徒曾经受到希特勒的战争罪恶的训练，曾经在他们的死亡集中营、煤气杀人室、麦丹尼克集中营、奥斯威辛集中营等许许多多杀人的地方杀死数百万无辜的和平百姓。难道能忘怀这些恶魔杀人流血成河，想要毁灭整个民族、整个国家的人民的事情吗？
    既然目前所进行的不仅是使西德重新军国主义化，而且是使西德加入反对欧洲其他国家的军事集团，那就不应当轻视这种局面的不利后果。这就是说，德国军国主义者和某些西方国家的侵略集团在众目睽睽之下公然勾结，以策划新的战争冒险。德国军国主义者和复仇主义者既拥有西德的富源，获得西方国家的，首先是美国侵略集团相应的支持，就不是没有理由指望这样会保证他们在短时期内在西欧取得军事优势，然后依靠这种优势，再把束缚他们的各种协定撕毁。
    苏联政府已经促起注意：巴黎协定是同一九四四年的法苏同盟互助条约和一九四二年的英苏战后合作互助条约不相容的。这两个条约同美国政府也签了字的波茨坦协定一样，规定法国、英国、美国和苏联采取共同的措施，防止德国实行新的侵略和预防德国军国主义复活。
    巴黎协定不但是在没有苏联参加下通过的，而且它的矛头是公开指向苏联，同时也是指向欧洲其他爱好和平的国家的。这种举动不能不破坏国际间的信任，不能不使破坏条约和协定的那些政府的政策失去信用。
    美国、英国和法国的统治集团一面恢复西德的军国主义，一面却硬说他们这样做是为着“西欧防御的利益”。苏联政府一再指出，这种说法是多么没有根据和虚伪，又是多么违背实际情况。
    这一点从下列事实就可以看出：参加巴黎协定的国家中任何一个国家过去和现在都没有受到任何侵略和进攻的威胁。这些国家中的任何一个国家过去没有说过，并且现在也没有理由说它有这种危险。由此可见，这里的所谓“防御利益”的论调只是为了在公众面前为它们的举动辩护。
    既然巴黎协定，像北大西洋集团的其他军事计划一样，是无法用“防御利益”这种虚伪的藉口加以辩护的，那么就不难理解巴黎协定的真正目的了。十分明显，吸收重新军国主义化的西德加入军事集团，是同在苏联和人民民主国家的国境附近的领土上建立许多军事基地抱有同样的目的。
    应当承认这也不是偶然的：随着所有这一切而来的必然是要求扩充军备，不断发表侵略性的言论，叫嚣同其他国家建立关系必须依靠实力、必须依靠进一步扩充武装力量。难道还须要更多的论据再来证明：巴黎协定，正像北大西洋集团其他的计划一样，不是为和平事业服务，而是目的在准备新战争吗？
    巴黎协定表明：美国以及英、法两国的侵略分子是跟恢复德国的统一的利益以及德国人民的整个利益敌对的。把西德变为军国主义国家，这就使西德同爱好和平的德意志民主共和国合并成为一个统一的、和平的和民主的德国成为不可能。这些侵略分子所感兴趣的只是如何利用西德来达到他们的目的。因此，他们的所作所为都是致力于最后打消根据民主和平的原则来恢复德国统一的愿望，这种愿望正是苏联所力求实现的。他们之所以需要复活德国军国主义，是为了：在这个基础上实现同德国军国主义者的勾结，并藉助于由他们新建立的并有重新军国主义化的德国参加的军事集团，来加强对苏联和没有参加它们军事集团的其他欧洲各国行施各种压力。这就是他们所称做的“实力政策”。
    似乎应当早就明白，任何威胁都吓不倒苏联人民和已经由同劳动农民结成联盟的工人阶级掌握政权并正在社会主义建设事业中胜利前进的各民主国家。如果说在过去这种企图都落得个破产的下场，那么在现在，当伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家对自己的地位、对今后社会主义建设的成就满怀着空前未有的信心的时候，任何这样的侵略计划就更加没有希望了。世界上没有任何力量能够使历史车轮倒退。
    苏联反对任何复活德国军国主义的计划，反对为了任何军事集团的利益而利用德国的这一部分或那一部分的任何阴谋，它主张法国、英国和美国同苏联一道，着手解决德国问题。为此，需要克服不小的困难，而首先是四大国必须就在和平、民主的基础上恢复德国统一的问题达成协议。而这又需要在举行全德自由选举的问题上达成协议，以便在这个选举的基础上选举全德议会，成立全德民主政府。
    四大国是否有就德国问题达成这样既符合欧洲安全的利益、又符合德国人民的民族利益的协议可能呢？苏联政府认为，达成这样的协议是可能的。只要四大国都不采取将德国这一部分或那一部分重新军国主义化的计划，而是都来努力在把德国恢复成为一个和平、民主、统一的国家的问题上求得意见一致，达成这样的协议是完全可能的。
    正因为如此，苏联政府在十月二十三日又一次建议召开四大国会议，讨论恢复德国统一和为此目的举行全德自由选举的问题，以及保证欧洲集体安全的问题，因为这两个任务有极其紧密的联系。然而至今已经一个多月，我们还没有收到对这一建议的答复。在另一方面，加速着手使西德军国主义化的工作都在竭力进行，其目的显然是要阻挠四大国就恢复德国统一的问题达成协议。
    有人认为，柏林会议的经验表明，没有可能指望四国能就恢复德国统一问题达成协议。这种看法我们是不能同意的。
    这里应该指出，当时所以没有取得协议，障碍在于美、英、法三国建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划，因为这个集团的主要目的是恢复德国军国主义，当然就遭到了苏联的拒绝。
    但是，自从“欧洲防务集团”计划在舆论的压力下破产后，在恢复德国统一问题上达成协议这件事，就具有了比较有利的前提。当然，至于真正有利的前提，那是只有在抛弃任何复活德国军国主义的计划后才谈得到的。那时才真正会有必需的前提来具体研究进行全德自由选举的条件，来研究四国已经提出或准备提出的关于这个问题的建议。
    苏联力求和美国、英国、法国就德国问题，首先是统一德国的问题达成协议。如果四国的行动全都有助于促进东德和西德的接近，并且设法使统一以后的德国成为一个真正和平、民主的国家，那么这个协议是可以达成的。
    早在欧洲战争结束后的头几年，美国、英国和法国就把德国分裂成为东西两部。现在每个人都可看到，西方国家当时坚决推行分裂德国的政策的目的何在。他们执行这种分裂政策，结果使西德的政权落入了德国军国主义者手中，现在西方国家的侵略集团勾结这些军国主义者去建立反对欧洲爱好和平的国家的军事联盟。现在美国、英国和法国正在着手重新武装西德，把西德拖入自己的军事集团，使西德和东德对立，使西欧国家和欧洲其他国家对立。这条路不但导向德国的内战，而且导向新的世界大战。
    现在正在加紧准备批准巴黎协定。西方国家的侵略集团在竭尽全力尽速实施上述协定，从而公开地复活西德军国主义，把西德拖入军事集团。
    这就是说，批准和实现巴黎协定会使整个国际局势大大复杂起来。
    重新军国主义化的西德一旦加入北大西洋军事集团和正在建立中的西欧军事联盟，美国、英国和法国所建立的军事集团的侵略性质就会大大加强。
    因为加入侵略性的军事集团的国家会增加陆军、空军和其他武装，特别是因为这些军事集团会把正在复活的西德军国主义作为自己的同盟者，所以欧洲其他许多国家就不得不采取有效的自卫措施来防止侵犯。
    西方国家的政策所引起的这种局势不会不使军备竞赛进一步加剧，使欧洲国家的军队和军事预算增加起来，这就会大大增加欧洲各国人民的纳税负担和其他负担。
    这一切说明，如果不放弃建立一些欧洲国家的军事集团来反对欧洲其他国家的政策，欧洲和平就不可能得到保障。
    建立这种军事集团会导致新的战争，欧洲国家必须联合自己的力量来奠定欧洲集体安全以代替这种集团。建立欧洲集体安全体系就是维护和巩固欧洲和平的道路。
    早在今年年初柏林四国会议的时候，苏联就已经提议讨论它所提出的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”基本原则草案。尽管这个草案没有得到法国、英国和美国方面的必要支持，但是关于建立有效的欧洲集体安全体系的问题从那时起一直是欧洲各国人民注意的中心。
    条约草案规定：凡是承认条约的宗旨并且承担条约规定的义务的一切欧洲国家，不问它们的社会制度如何，都可以参加这个条约。条约草案还规定：在德国统一之前，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国可以以平等地位参加条约；在德国统一之后，统一了的德国也可以参加条约。这个条约草案又规定：缔约国有互不侵犯和互不以武力威胁的义务；缔约国应该用符合联合国宪章的和平手段来解决缔约国之间可能发生的一切纠纷。当一个或几个缔约国在欧洲受到武装侵犯时，每个缔约国都有义务尽力帮助一个或几个遭到这种侵犯的国家，包括使用武装部队来恢复和保持欧洲的国际和平和安全在内。缔约国不得参加或缔结违背欧洲集体安全条约的宗旨的某种联盟、同盟或任何协定。
    苏联政府认为：全欧条约基本原则的这个草案或其他类似的草案，可以作为基础去建立足以真正保障欧洲人民的和平和安全的集体安全体系。
    苏联政府在提出上述条约草案的同时，还宣布它准备研究可能提出的、能够促使一切有关国家达成协议的其他建议。但是，必须指出，苏联政府虽然一再建议美国、英国和法国政府着手研究对和平事业如此重要的问题，上述三个国家的政府却一直回避这个问题。
    大家知道，最初对苏联政府提出的草案的反对意见牵涉到下面两点：一、美国参加欧洲集体安全体系的问题；二、苏联政府对于北大西洋联盟的态度。但是当苏联政府在今年三月表示赞成美国参加全欧条约、并且表示愿意同有关各国政府共同考虑关于苏联参加北大西洋条约的问题时，三个西方国家的政府就开始找寻新的藉口来拒绝共同研究关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的问题。
    九个月以前，苏联政府在柏林会议上提出了关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。美国、英国和法国的政府并不接受这个建议。四个月前，苏联政府建议召开全欧会议讨论这个问题，随后又提议召开四国会议初步讨论这个问题。然而，苏联这些建议也没有被这三个西方国家接受。
    由于最近以来出现了日益加紧的各种措施图谋尽速批准同欧洲集体安全原则针锋相对的巴黎协定，苏联政府在同波兰及捷克斯洛伐克政府进行了有关的磋商后，建议在十一月二十九日召开全欧会议讨论这个问题。我们现在知道，美国、英国和法国的政府对这个建议也没有接受。
    由此可见，苏联在今年内曾经三次建议美国、英国和法国政府共同讨论迫切的和非常成熟的欧洲集体安全问题，但是，这些建议一次也没有得到上述各国政府的支持。
    美国、英国和法国的政府不敢直接拒绝建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。这显然是因为它们不能不考虑到欧洲各国人民要求巩固欧洲和平和安全的愿望正在日益加强。但是上述各国政府却千方百计地阻挠建立欧洲集体安全。
    不能不指出，这几个国家的政府不但回避讨论苏联提出的关于欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案，而且也不提出它们自己关于这个问题的任何建议，这也不是偶然的。它们现在的计划体现在巴黎协定中，这个协定的目的不是保障欧洲的集体安全和和平，而是建立把重新军国主义化了的西德包括在内的军事集团，这种集团只会使欧洲的战争危险加深，并且使国际局势进一步紧张起来。
    大家知道，在欧洲建立起侵略性的北大西洋集团军事组织已经有好几年了。这个组织有自己的参谋部，这个参谋部制订在欧洲发动新战争的计划，在挨近苏联和人民民主国家边界的地方建立许多空军和海军基地。这个侵略集团还有一个喜欢经常大言不惭地发出好战言论的总司令——美国将军。
    巴黎协定标志着策划欧洲新战争的特别危险的新阶段。派代表参加这次会议的苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和德意志民主共和国的人民了解到：对西方帝国主义国家目前的计划，不仅要特别警惕，而且要采取实际步骤来保证自己的安全。欧洲和欧洲以外的其他国家的人民也应当了解这一点。
    出席我们的会议的有中华人民共和国的代表，中华人民共和国参加解决重要的国际问题是符合所有爱好和平国家的利益的。欧洲国家和中华人民共和国之间的友好合作的发展，会有助于巩固欧洲和平和世界和平。
    因为最近有人准备批准巴黎协定并且准备实施这些协定，爱好和平的欧洲国家就不能只采取到目前为止它们为了保卫自己曾经采取的措施。这个问题首先关系到出席这次会议的国家。当然，这也关系到那些不愿意成为策划和发动欧洲新战争的走卒和帮凶的其他爱好和平的国家。
    为了巩固地保障自身的安全，爱好和平的欧洲国家应当团结自己的力量，并且在一旦批准和实施巴黎协定的时候，大大加强这种力量。为了这个目的，就必须充分地准备采取一些适应于目前局势的措施去加强防御力量。这就要求参加这次会议的国家在组织武装部队及建立司令部方面采取共同措施，并且采取其他措施，以便可靠地保护我们这些国家的人民的和平劳动，保障他们的国境不受侵犯、并且防止可能的侵略。
    苏联政府深信：派代表参加这次会议的国家一致愿意促进巩固和平和欧洲各国（不论它们的社会制度和国家制度如何）的集体安全。
    但是，爱好和平的国家不能不考虑到某些西方国家的侵略集团竭力要破坏欧洲集体安全体系的建立。最近时期，他们企图加紧建立危害和平事业的军事集团，以至于想把在他们帮助下复活起来的德国军国主义作为他们主要的军事支柱。正因为这样，我们就不应该对下列情况置之不理或估计不足：巴黎协定的批准要求采取新的重大措施来保障爱好和平的国家应有的防御力量，来维持和巩固欧洲和平。
    某些西方国家政府所匆忙拟订的巴黎协定不可能得到各国人民的真正支持，因为巴黎协定的目的是反对各国人民的利益、首先是反对和平的利益的。巴黎协定反映了西方三国不久以前在伦敦会议和巴黎会议上急忙赶制的侵略计划和军事政治阴谋。反对巴黎协定的斗争还只是刚刚展开。
    至于我们的建议，它的目的在保证欧洲和平和集体安全，它的目的在代替危害和平事业有危险的复活德国军国主义的阴谋，而按照普遍和平的利益和德国人民本身的利益，在德国问题上达成国际协议。这些建议受到欧洲和全世界各国人民的全力支持。
    现在的欧洲国家会议就极其明显地表明了这一点。因此，这个会议毫无疑问会是建立欧洲集体安全体系的一个重要步骤，这个体系受到欧洲和全世界各国人民支持，它对防止新的世界大战有头等重要意义。
    苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的人民以及同我们友好的其他国家满怀信心地展望将来。
    派代表出席会议的各国的政策和实际措施都有一个共同的目的：无比忠诚地为人民的利益、为劳动者的利益服务。
    这就是说，我们必须时时刻刻促进巩固和平和各国人民之间的友谊，争取我们各国人民的经济和文化不断地发展，以保证社会主义国家劳动人民的生活水平得到更大的提高。社会主义国家的内政政策和外交政策是依赖人民一致的支持的。
    这次莫斯科会议所要讨论的问题不但对欧洲各国人民，而且对保障普遍和平的事业，具有重大的意义。
      苏联政府深信：欧洲国家为了保障欧洲国家的和平和安全而举行的莫斯科会议，会光荣地完成进一步团结各国人民以巩固欧洲和平和安全的任务。
    同时，这一次会议会促使全世界的和平力量进一步地、更加有力地团结起来。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科三十日电）
