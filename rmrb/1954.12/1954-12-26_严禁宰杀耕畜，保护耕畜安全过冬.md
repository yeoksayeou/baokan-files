    Strictly Prohibit the Slaughter of Draught Animals and Protect Draught Animals to Safely Overwinter

    Recently, this newspaper has received many letters from readers requesting that various localities strictly prohibit the slaughter of draught animals and protect draught animals to safely overwinter. According to readers' reflections: since autumn, the phenomenon of slaughterhouses indiscriminately slaughtering draught animals and draught animals freezing and starving to death has been quite serious in some counties and districts of Hebei, Henan, Jiangxi, Anhui and other provinces.

    Why is it that a large number of draught animals are being slaughtered and dying? According to the analysis of the letters, some areas suffered from floods, and fodder was lacking. Some farmers felt it difficult to feed them and sold their draught animals. In other areas, the draught animal pens were washed away by floods, and farmers were unable to rebuild them for a while, leaving the draught animals in the open, causing frostbite and death. At the same time, some slaughterhouse merchants took advantage of the farmers' difficulties in feeding draught animals to buy draught animals at low prices and slaughter them for profit. However, the local leaders did not deal with this problem in a timely manner.

    The large-scale slaughter and death of draught animals will inevitably affect production this winter and next spring. According to Wang Feng from the Hebei Youth Daily, the 11th District of Hejian County, Hebei Province, originally had 3,424 draught animals, with each animal cultivating an average of 46.3 mu of land; now there are only 1,993 draught animals, with each animal cultivating an average of 79.5 mu of land. Obviously, the animal power is insufficient. Therefore, although the district made great efforts to mobilize farmers to carry out winter plowing, as of November 26, there were still 20,000 mu of arable land in the district that had not been winter-plowed. Spring plowing next year will of course be even more problematic.

    Draught animals are an indispensable power source for agricultural production in our country at present. If we do not pay attention to the maintenance and care of draught animals in winter, and if we do not quickly stop the phenomenon of indiscriminately slaughtering draught animals, then the difficulties in farmers' production and life will be difficult to solve next spring, and the plan for increasing agricultural production will be difficult to guarantee. Therefore, Party committees and governments at all levels must pay sufficient attention to the work of protecting draught animals. On the one hand, farmers should be educated on protecting and cherishing animals, explaining the impact of draught animals on agricultural production and farmers' lives, and mobilizing farmers to overcome difficulties and raise draught animals well; at the same time, specific difficulties of farmers lacking fodder should be solved. For example: the supply and marketing cooperatives can purchase it, or the government can organize draught animals in disaster areas to be fostered in non-disaster areas with grass; the cooperatives can purchase fodder from non-disaster areas to supply draught animals in disaster areas; or the cooperatives can find grass sources on behalf of the farmers and organize farmers lacking grass to purchase it from other places. It is also possible to educate the masses to carry forward the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual aid, and agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and individual farmers with surplus grass help farmers lacking grass to raise draught animals on their behalf, using animal labor to offset fodder; or mobilize the masses to save grass, and lend and sell the surplus grass to farmers lacking grass. It is also possible to organize farmers in disaster areas to engage in transportation with draught animals, so as to support animals with animals. The taxation authorities and county and district governments at all levels should strictly manage slaughterhouse merchants, strictly implement inspection and approval procedures, and livestock that do not meet the slaughter standards must not be slaughtered; those few unscrupulous slaughterhouse merchants who deliberately cause injury and disability, indiscriminately slaughter draught animals, and seek illegal profits should be dealt with by law according to the seriousness of the circumstances.

### 严禁宰杀耕畜，保护耕畜安全过冬

    严禁宰杀耕畜，保护耕畜安全过冬
    最近本报接到不少读者来信，要求各地严禁宰杀耕畜，保护耕畜安全过冬。据读者反映：入秋以后，河北、河南、江西、安徽等省部分县区，屠宰商滥宰耕畜和耕畜冻饿而死的现象相当严重。
    为什么会造成耕畜大批被宰杀和死亡的现象呢？根据来信分析，有些地区遭受水灾后，草料缺乏，有的农民感到喂养困难，就将耕畜卖出。也有的地区因耕畜圈栏被水冲坏，农民一时无力修建，把耕畜放在露天里，造成冻伤和死亡。同时，由于有些屠宰商人乘着农民喂养耕畜的困难，压价收买耕畜，宰杀牟利。而当地领导方面对于这个问题却没有及时地给予处理。
    耕畜的大批被宰杀和死亡，必然要影响今冬和明春的生产。据河北青年报社王峰来信反映，河北省河间县十一区原有耕畜三千四百二十四头，每头平均耕地四十六点三亩；现在只有耕畜一千九百九十三头，每头平均要耕地七十九点五亩。显然畜力是不足的。因此，区里虽然尽了很大的努力发动农民进行冬耕，但直到十一月二十六日全区还有二万亩应耕地没有冬耕。明年的春耕当然更成问题。
    耕畜是我国目前农业生产上不可缺少的动力。如果在冬季不注意对耕畜的保养和爱护，如果不迅速制止滥宰耕畜的现象，那末到明年春天，农民生产和生活上的困难就难以解决，农业增产的计划也难以保证。因此，各地党委和政府对保护耕畜的工作必须予以足够的重视，一方面对农民要进行保畜、爱畜的教育，说明耕畜对农业生产和农民生活的影响，动员农民克服困难养好耕畜；同时对农民缺乏饲草的具体困难应设法解决。如：可以由供销合作社收购或由政府组织灾区耕畜到有草的非灾区去寄养；由合作社到非灾区收购草料来供应灾区耕畜；或者由合作社代为寻找草源，组织缺草农民到外地去购买。也可以教育群众发扬互助互济精神，有余草的农业生产合作社、互助组和个体农民帮助缺草的农民代养耕畜，以畜工抵草料；或者动员群众节约用草，把余草借给和卖给缺草农民。还可以组织灾区农民用耕畜来搞运输，做到以畜养畜。各税务机关和县、区政府对屠宰商要严格管理，严格执行检验、批准手续，凡不合宰杀标准的牲畜决不允许宰杀；对少数故意制造伤残、滥宰耕畜谋取非法利润的不法屠宰商，应根据情节轻重予以法办。
