The winter rapeseed planting work has concluded across the country. Initial estimates indicate that the national rapeseed winter planting area may exceed last year's by ten million mu. In the key rapeseed-producing provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Henan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, the average expansion in planting area compared to last year is 45%. Among them, Henan Province expanded by 82%, and Hunan and Guizhou provinces expanded by over 70%. Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, which suffered severe flooding this year, also expanded by approximately 56%. Other provinces, such as Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Xikang, have also seen significant increases in rapeseed acreage.

During the rapeseed sowing period this year, most of the southern provinces experienced a lack of rain, and waterlogged areas drained slowly. Late-autumn crops matured relatively late, and the sowing period was generally delayed by ten days to half a month compared to normal years. In many areas, this resulted in a last-minute rush to plant, leading to rough cultivation and widespread instances of missing seedlings and broken rows. Furthermore, prolonged drought and warm weather in early winter led to outbreaks of pests. Currently, agricultural departments in various regions are actively guiding farmers, based on local rapeseed growth conditions, to carry out thinning and replanting, pest control, application of winter fertilizer, and frost prevention to protect seedlings, striving for a bumper rapeseed harvest next year.

    全国油菜冬播面积比去年扩大一千万亩
    各地油菜冬播工作已经结束，初步估计，全国油菜冬播面积可超过去年一千万亩。油菜重点产区四川、湖北、湖南、江西、安徽、浙江、江苏、河南、云南、贵州等十省，平均比去年扩种百分之四十五，其中河南省扩种百分之八十二，湖南、贵州两省扩种百分之七十以上，今年受水灾严重的湖北、江西两省也都扩种了百分之五十六左右，其他广西、广东、福建、西康等省，油菜面积也有显著增加。
    今年油菜播种时期，南方各省大部缺雨，灾区脱水缓慢，晚秋作物成熟较迟，播种期一般较常年推迟十天到半月，不少地区形成后期突击抢种，耕作粗放，缺苗断垄现象甚为普遍；又加天气久旱，初冬温暖，虫害也相继发生。目前各地农业部门，正在根据当地油菜生长情况，积极指导农民进行间苗补苗、防治虫害、追施冬肥及防冻保苗等工作，争取明年菜籽丰收。
