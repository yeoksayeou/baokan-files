Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 18th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru, speaking to some Congress Party members of parliament on the 17th, addressed the United Nations General Assembly's resolution condemning China's sentencing of eleven American spies as a violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Nehru said it was strange that the United Nations condemned China without first investigating the facts. Nehru also said that the UN General Assembly resolution was "very unfortunate and made the problem more difficult."

Nehru further emphasized that it was contradictory for the United Nations not to recognize China while wanting to negotiate with it.

Nehru said that when Zhou Enlai had agreed to meet with UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, China had not thereby undertaken any obligations.

Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: Rangoon Dispatch: The "New Light of Burma" published an editorial on the 15th criticizing the US-Chiang treaty, saying, "It is very clear that the US-Chiang treaty is a manifestation of the United States taking the opportunity to interfere in China's internal affairs, and interfering in other countries' internal affairs is undermining peace." The editorial also stated, "The United States is not only interfering itself, but is also preparing to use the name of the United Nations to conspire to create another war, turning Taiwan into a second Korean War."

The "New Light of Burma" pointed out that the United States is using the US-Chiang treaty to prepare for a long-term occupation of Taiwan. The newspaper said: "At a time when US President Eisenhower is constantly delivering speeches on peace, his government is taking such actions to undermine peace, which is an extremely shameful thing."

The newspaper emphasized: "Taiwan is Chinese territory, Taiwan is inhabited by Chinese people, Taiwan must be liberated by China, and the United States should not interfere in other countries' internal affairs."

    尼赫鲁总理评联大诬蔑我国的非法决议
    缅甸新光报抨击美国利用美蒋条约干涉我国内政
   【新华社新德里十八日电】印度总理尼赫鲁十七日在对一些国大党的议员们讲话时谈到了联合国大会诬蔑中国判处十一名美国间谍案件为违反朝鲜停战协定的决议。尼赫鲁说联合国没有首先调查事实而就谴责中国，这是很奇怪的。尼赫鲁又说联合国大会的决议是“很不幸的，而且使得问题更为困难”。
    尼赫鲁进一步强调指出，联合国既不承认中国，同时又想和它谈判，这是自相矛盾。
    尼赫鲁在说到周恩来已经同意接见联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德时说，中国并没有因此而负有任何义务。
    【新华社十八日讯】仰光消息：“缅甸新光报”十五日发表社论抨击美蒋条约说：“事实很明显，美蒋条约就是美国趁机干涉中国内政的表现，干涉他国内政就是破坏和平”。社论又说：“美国不但自己进行干涉，同时准备借用联合国的名义来阴谋制造另一次战争，把台湾变成第二个朝鲜战争”。
      “缅甸新光报”指出，美国利用美蒋条约准备长期占领台湾。报纸说：“在美国总统艾森豪威尔不断发表和平讲演的时候，他的政府又作出这种破坏和平的行动，这是一件极为可耻的事”。
    报纸强调说：“台湾是中国的领土，台湾居住的是中国人民，台湾一定要被中国解放，美国不应干涉他国的内政。”
