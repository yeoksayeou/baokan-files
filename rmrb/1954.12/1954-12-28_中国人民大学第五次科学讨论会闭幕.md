The Fifth Scientific Discussion Conference of Renmin University of China concluded on the 26th after nine days of meetings. Over 3,100 people participated in the conference, including teachers, graduate students, students, and teaching administrative staff from Renmin University of China, as well as over 1,400 guests from relevant enterprise departments, academic research institutions, and universities outside the university. In addition, representatives from some universities, factories, and mines in Tianjin, Northeast China, East China, Central China, South China, and Southwest China also traveled long distances to participate. During the conference, twenty-six papers were reported and discussed.

The characteristics of this scientific discussion conference are that, in terms of the content of the reports, it further integrated with the requirements of the overall national task and raised some important issues in China's current economic construction, political power construction, and cultural construction. The topics of the scientific reports and discussions had practical significance. In terms of the form of discussion, it was relatively lively and vigorous, with extensive academic freedom of debate and criticism. More than 150 people spoke at the plenary and group sessions, including more than 50 academic researchers from outside the university and practical workers from factories and mines, who offered sincere opinions and criticisms on the reports and provided rich practical materials.

The atmosphere of free academic debate reached a climax at the plenary discussion sessions on the 25th and 26th. At the meeting, two reports, "'How the Hu Shih School Distorted Classical Chinese Literature Since the May Fourth Movement' and "'The Social Background of the Creation of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' and Its Tendencies," were presented first. The conference continued for nearly six hours of discussion and debate. Those who spoke at the meeting included Yang Zhengdian, Sun Jian, and Gong Gujin, teachers of Renmin University of China, Cheng Haiguo, a student, Wu Rong, a data clerk, and Feng Zhi, Wu Dakun, Zhong Jingwen, Li Xifan, and Lan Ling, cultural and academic figures, and others, a total of eleven people. They focused more on the historical background of "Dream of the Red Chamber," the contradictions it reflected, and the typicality of Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu, and engaged in free and heated debates.

On the afternoon of the 26th, Soviet expert F. S. Pavlov gave an important report on "Class Struggle in the Soviet Transitional Period."

At the end of the discussion conference, President Wu Yuzhang made a concluding speech. He said: The scale, content of reports, and discussion of this discussion conference have made progress compared with the past. However, in order to further improve and enhance scientific research, it is necessary to further carry out academic criticism and discussion on the basis of improving scientific research; to strengthen ties with relevant business departments, scientific institutions, and universities outside the university; the selection of scientific research topics should be closely integrated with the actual national construction, teaching practice, and ideological struggle; to carry out scientific research more widely, and to absorb senior students to participate in scientific activities.
