Cheng Chonggui's Speech

Chairman, Members of the Committee:

I have listened to Vice Chairman Chen Chutong's report on the work of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Commissioner Zhang Boqian's explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report. I fully agree with and support them.

I am a follower of Jesus Christ and have been preaching the gospel for fifty years. I have always been considered one of the most conservative and stubborn sects by my fellow believers. I was ignorant and deceived by imperialism, considering anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiments as a pure belief. However, under the wise and correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved tremendous victories in their great revolutionary struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. On this foundation, they have achieved great successes in defense, politics, economy, culture, education, and other aspects. These ironclad facts have opened my eyes, enlightened my thoughts, and educated me. Through a series of studies, even this old fool cannot help but love his country, hate American imperialism, and be deeply grateful to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party. I have also developed a deep affection for the Soviet Union. At the same time, I enjoy the freedom of religious belief, and my religious beliefs have not been shaken. Instead, they have become purer. I still believe in God and the resurrection of Jesus, and I still hope for eternal life. I read the scriptures and pray every day to maintain my communication with the Father. I am still eager to preach Jesus and his cross. I have come to realize that loving the country and loving the church can be harmonious, and that being friendly with the Soviet Union and striving for lasting world peace is in line with the teachings of our Lord Jesus.

On the basis of loving the country and opposing imperialism, to unite all Christians in China, on September 23, 1950, 1,527 responsible persons and believers of the Christian Church in China, led by Mr. Wu Yaozong, issued the "Declaration of the Path of Effort for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China." This declaration pointed out the bright path for Chinese Christianity to be anti-imperialist, patriotic, and loving the church, calling on all churches and individual believers to sever ties with imperialism, eliminate imperialist influence, and thoroughly implement the self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation of the Chinese church. In the past four years, 417,389 Christians have signed this document, accounting for about two-thirds of all Christians in China. We are still continuing our efforts to unite and win over all Christians in China to join our movement. Because the unity of Christianity is a link in the great unity of the Chinese people, although it is a small link, the disunity of the church will have an adverse effect on the great unity of the people. Any believer, for any reason, who causes division and does not unite, is what the American imperialists like, and therefore is not approved by the people. We hope and believe that in the near future, every believer in the country will learn and receive patriotic education and will definitely unite under the banner of patriotism and anti-imperialism. Even an old stubborn person like me can change, let alone others? In July of this year, the first national conference of Chinese Christianity was held in the capital, and the China Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee was officially established. From the perspective of the Christian Church itself, in the past four years, the main achievements have been that the Chinese Church has basically severed ties with imperialism in personnel, administration, and economy, begun to eliminate imperialist influence, and initially realized self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation. For more than a hundred years, Chinese Christianity has been controlled by foreign missions and used by imperialism as a tool for invasion. Through the church, schools, and hospitals, they cultivated pro-American, pro-American, anti-American, anti-communist, and anti-Soviet thoughts among Chinese believers, making the Chinese Christian Church alienated from the masses, unable to distinguish right from wrong, unable to tell friends from enemies, and even treating enemies as friends and traitors as fathers, becoming intellectual captives of imperialism. The country is liberated, and the Christian Church has also been liberated. The Three-Self Patriotic Movement has changed the face of Christianity, making the Christian Church gradually become a religious organization run by Chinese believers themselves. At the same time, it has also criticized imperialist ideological poisons. Now it can be said that the vast majority of Christians in our country love their country, hate American imperialism, and abide by the constitution and laws. We highly value the freedom of religious belief stipulated in the constitution. Under the leadership of the National Committee of the Political Consultative Conference, we have carried out a series of studies, often encouraging each other, and will never misuse this precious right to engage in any activities that harm the interests of the people. We have recognized the greatness and loveliness of our motherland, we have seen the bright and beautiful future of our motherland, and we want to work together with the people of the whole country to strive for the construction of a great socialist society. Now we have also awakened, recognized the ugly face of American imperialism, and known how sinister, cunning, and vicious those war mongers are. The national conference of Christianity held this year passed a resolution expressing our unanimous indignation and condemnation of American imperialism's occupation of our territory, Taiwan. Taiwan is a sacred part of our country's territory, and we must liberate Taiwan. We hate the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. He shamelessly signed a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the United States, which is simply a contract for the traitor Chiang to sell our country's territory. The statement by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on this treaty thoroughly exposed the plot of the U.S. government to use the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to attempt to occupy our country's territory, Taiwan, for a long time, to expand its aggression against our country, and to prepare for a new war of aggression. This statement once again solemnly declared to the world the firm will of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, oppose aggression, and defend peace. We Chinese Christians fully support this. The compatriots in Taiwan are struggling and calling for their motherland under the bloody rule of the Chiang bandits. We must save them from the depths of misery. Chinese Christians, of course, will work together with the people of the whole country to strive for the liberation of Taiwan. We will love our country and abide by the law, respond to the government's call, and actively participate in the construction of our motherland. Based on the teachings of Lord Jesus, we firmly oppose American imperialism's aggressive war, oppose American imperialism's use of religion to invade, and we will strive for lasting world peace. We believe that to maintain and strive for world peace, it is necessary to liberate Taiwan and recover our territory.

Wang Shuzhang's Speech

Chairman, Members of the Committee:

I fully support the political report of Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai, the work report of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

I feel very honored to be invited to participate in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference this time. In the past, I was a soldier in the Northeast Army. In the old China, I was a lackey of the reactionary ruling class in that dark and corrupt government. The "September 18th Incident" occurred, and my hometown in the Northeast was occupied by Japanese imperialism. I joined the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek with the hope and enthusiasm of recovering lost territory. At that time, I had illusions about the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, mistakenly believing that they could unite the people of the whole country to resist Japanese aggression and recover the lost territory of the Northeast. As a result, my wishes and reality were completely opposite. The traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek completely disregarded the interests of the people and had no shame, selling the Northeast entirely and tolerating the Japanese aggression with the so-called "policy of non-resistance," allowing the Japanese aggressors to advance step by step into the interior of China. As a result, not only did the people of the Northeast completely suffer national destruction and family ruin, but the broad masses of people in North China, Central China, and East China also fell into the same tragic situation of national destruction and family ruin. It was then that my illusions were completely shattered. It was very clear that no matter when and under what conditions, we could not follow Chiang Kai-shek. Following him was a dead end. This is my personal experience of more than twenty years. However, the history of my service to the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, no matter how it is said, is a crime against the people. The great Communist Party and Chairman Mao, however, gave me the opportunity to become a new person. For this, I am deeply grateful and ashamed. In the future, I will only dedicate the remaining years of my life to follow the people of the whole country, to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front of our country, to complete the tasks of the transitional period of the state, and to fight against domestic and foreign enemies.

The New China has been established for five years. In this short period, the face of our motherland and the living conditions of the people of the whole country have undergone a completely new transformation. These changes are unprecedented and great. They have enabled the people of the whole country to move from a position of being enslaved and impoverished to a position of being the masters of the house, living a free, democratic, and happy life. They have enabled China, which has been humiliated in the international community for more than a hundred years, to regain its high international prestige. The brotherly friendship between our People's Republic of China and the Soviet Socialist Republic has become a strong fortress for resisting aggression and defending peace in the world. These experiences have been very profound for me in the past few years. Therefore, I firmly believe that the People's Republic of China, with the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, will definitely be able to gradually transition from the current society to a happy and prosperous socialist society. With the brotherly cooperation of the Soviet Union, China, and all the countries of the peace-loving, democratic, and socialist camp, together with the people of the world who love peace, there will be no insurmountable difficulties and no enemies that cannot be defeated.

Everyone knows that there is a serious threat of aggressive war on our path of peaceful construction. The American aggressors are using every means and in the most vicious way to plot the invasion of our mainland. The so-called "mutual defense treaty" between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek has already been signed on December 2nd. This is the last contract of surrender for the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, a criminal act of the American aggressors openly occupying our territory, blatantly violating international law, and infringing upon our sovereignty. Any Chinese person with a sense of justice cannot tolerate this. As a person from the Northeast, I must first remember the painful lesson that the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek brought to the people of the whole country by selling the Northeast. At that time, after Chiang Kai-shek sold the Northeast, the Japanese aggressors used the Northeast as a base for invading the whole of China. As a result, after the "Mukden Incident," there was soon another "Lugou Bridge Incident." Today, Chiang Kai-shek sells Taiwan to the American aggressors, which will inevitably lead to the American aggressors using Taiwan as a base to invade the mainland of China. Therefore, the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek is extremely evil and is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the peoples of the East. The American aggressors are even more the common enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world. The Chinese people, who have had enough lessons, will never allow history to repeat itself. Therefore, we must completely annihilate the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek and cut off the spear of the American aggressors. The old road taken by the Japanese aggressors was to first occupy the Northeast and then invade the whole of China, resulting in their eventual annihilation. Today, the American aggressors attempt to use Taiwan as a base and the traitor Chiang as a tool to prepare for a large-scale attack on the whole of China, and they will also meet with annihilation. Today, our China is a strong China. We have won the victory of supporting Korea and resisting the United States, and we will definitely be able to liberate Taiwan and completely annihilate the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek and cut off the claws of the American aggressors. I used to be afraid of the American bandits, and perhaps there are still people like me who think that the American Empire is terrifying. Now I am clear, the American Empire is indeed a paper tiger. The Japanese imperialists were also very terrifying, but they ended up being a paper tiger. All imperialists are the same, they are all paper tigers. Therefore, as long as we resist aggression, we can definitely defend peace. Now, perhaps there are still people who believe the deception propaganda of imperialists such as "neutralizing Taiwan" and "trusteeship of Taiwan," thinking that this way we can live in peace. We absolutely cannot be deceived again. In the past, the Japanese imperialists also deceived us in this way after occupying the Northeast, for example, the "League of Nations" tacitly approved the puppet government of "Manchukuo" created by the Japanese aggressors. Today's American aggressors are the same as the former Japanese fascists; today's traitor Chiang Kai-shek is the same as the former Puyi. Therefore, the so-called "neutralization" and "trusteeship" are to hand over our territory to the aggressors. Taiwan is our sacred territory, and the liberation of Taiwan is our internal affair, which does not allow others to interfere. For the unity of the motherland and to defend the peace and security of East Asia and the world, we must liberate Taiwan. I am willing to dedicate all my strength to fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan.

Bai Haifeng's Speech

Chairman, Members of the Committee:

I fully agree with and support Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report, Vice Chairman Chen Chutong's report on the work of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I am willing to actively implement them in my actual work.

I feel particularly honored and excited to be able to participate in this conference. I am representing the Mongolian ethnic minority. Therefore, I would like to briefly report on the changes that have taken place in various ethnic minority areas since liberation. We all know that before liberation, the ethnic minorities in China were subjected to various oppressions and exploitations by feudalism, imperialism, and the reactionary Kuomintang. All ethnic minorities lived in extremely painful, hard, and dark lives of poverty. No matter which ethnic minority, everywhere they were discriminated against and humiliated, and many people did not dare to openly admit that they were ethnic minorities. The reactionary ruling class of the Kuomintang did not even recognize the existence of ethnic minorities within the country. As for equal rights, it was even more out of the question. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the brilliant guidance and wise measures of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, even the most remote regions of the country have undergone a complete transformation. Various ethnic minority autonomous governments of different levels have been established in ethnic minority areas, realizing the long-awaited wish of "self-government" for thousands of years, developing political, economic, and cultural construction, and greatly improving material and cultural life, getting rid of the past dark and poor days. Take Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang as examples, the development there is even more remarkable. Now, many light and heavy industries have been established, and they are progressing happily with the domestic advanced Han areas under the guidance of the general line of the transitional period of the state. This shows that the new China after liberation, like the Soviet Union after the October Revolution, has no racial discrimination and oppression. This kind of united and cooperative ethnic relationship is also guaranteed and consolidated by the recently promulgated Constitution of the People's Republic of China. This is not difficult to understand why the people of all ethnic groups in the country have such a close and affectionate love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, like parents and the sun.

At the same time, I would like to take this opportunity to express my firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's recent statement on the "mutual defense treaty" signed by American imperialism and the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek. This treaty, which further colludes with American imperialism and the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, attempts to permanently occupy our territory, Taiwan, and continue to expand the aggression against our motherland, not only obstructs the Chinese people from liberating their sacred territory, Taiwan, but also seriously threatens the peace and security needed for the socialist construction of our motherland, and also threatens the peace and security of Asia and the world. This is a treaty to prepare for a new world war of aggression. Therefore, we, the people of all ethnic groups in China, should firmly support the statement of Foreign Minister Zhou, concentrate all our strength, oppose any treaty signed by the American-Chiang traitors, and definitely liberate Taiwan, save the people of Taiwan from disaster, and return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland. But we know that American imperialism violates international law, disregards the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation it signed, disregards the justice of billions of people around the world, disregards the repeated opposition and warnings of the Chinese people, and does not accept the lessons of its own military and diplomatic failures, stubbornly insists on helping the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, who is despised by the 600 million people of China, to occupy Taiwan, and becomes an enemy of the powerful 600 million people of China. As our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai stated, "If the U.S. government does not withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, and continues to interfere in China's internal affairs, the U.S. government must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this." The power of the people of the new China who have stood up is boundless. We firmly oppose war and demand peace, but we are not afraid of the threat of war. We unanimously respond to the call of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, for the integrity and security of the territory and sovereignty of the motherland, for the maintenance of the peace and security of Asia and the world, and to be more closely united under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, to enhance revolutionary vigilance, to prevent the sabotage activities of enemy spies, to strengthen all work, to actively develop production, to exceed the production increase plan for industry and agriculture, to strengthen national defense forces, to thoroughly annihilate the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek and to smash any imperialist forces that obstruct the liberation of Taiwan, to complete the great historical task of socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland. Finally, I feel that this conference has given me a good opportunity to learn. I have listened to various reports and speeches by the members, and I have been greatly enlightened and educated. In the future, I will strengthen my studies, study the various policies of the state, and improve my level of Marxism-Leninism theory, thoroughly reform my remaining old thoughts and old worldviews, and strive to better serve the people.

Du Runsheng's Speech

Chairman, Members of the Committee:

Over the past year, in the countryside, many works have been carried out around the central task of the socialist transformation of agriculture by the state. These works have brought new benefits to the peasants and have been enthusiastically welcomed and strongly supported by the broad masses of peasants. I will now explain the main points of these works:

First, the development of mutual aid and cooperation. At present, a large number of mutual aid teams and more than 400,000 agricultural production cooperatives have been developed nationwide. Various places have conducted a check on the production performance of the 100,000 cooperatives established before the spring of this year. The results of the inspection show that although these cooperatives generally still rely on the old-style farming tools for production, the increase in production is quite significant, with more than 90% increasing production. Generally, the increase is about 15%, and the maximum increase is more than onefold. The mutual aid and cooperative organizations not only increased their own production but also helped the surrounding individual peasant farmers to increase production. This year, some important grain-producing areas suffered serious floods, where the production suffered considerable losses, but the national grain output still exceeded last year. The main reason for this is that the masses were able to rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to overcome various difficulties. The development of production and the improvement of living conditions have been the wishes of the peasants from generation to generation. Now the objective facts have told the peasants that the most reliable way to realize this wish is only to participate in mutual aid and cooperation, and the way of making money by exploiting others, like the rich peasants, is not feasible. At present, although there are still some peasants who are still attached to the individual farming method and have some concerns or misunderstandings about mutual aid and cooperation, we believe that as long as we pay attention to guiding them correctly, using the methods of patient persuasion, demonstration by example, and step-by-step development, the scale of mutual aid and cooperation will definitely become larger and larger, and the number of participants will definitely become more and more. In the government work report delivered at the first session of the First National People's Congress, Premier Zhou proposed: "We hope that by the end of the first five-year plan, more than half of the peasant households and land in the country can join agricultural production cooperatives." This call has been widely responded to by the peasant masses. This requirement can be completed and may even be overfulfilled.

Second, overcoming floods. This summer and autumn, the floods in the Jianghuai region were fierce, and our enemies took a schadenfreude attitude, believing that this flood disaster would be the most serious blow to our national economic construction and people's lives. However, the actual situation was not developing according to their wishes. Due to the series of water conservancy projects carried out in the past few years, due to the fact that most of the local masses have already been organized in production, due to the fact that the party and the local people's government have led the work effectively and powerfully, and due to the fact that the whole country has united to support and help the disaster-stricken areas, because of these, we have achieved solid results in flood control and rescue, safe evacuation, drainage and embankment repair, rebuilding homes, and restoring production. Under the firm and tenacious spirit of mutual aid and unity of the masses, many moving deeds have been created. As a result, the onslaught of the great flood was defeated by the people, the scope of the flood's destruction was greatly reduced, the lives and property of the majority of the people in the affected areas were largely saved, the will and strength of the people to overcome natural disasters were tempered, and the experience of struggle was enriched, and the party and the government's ties with the peasants were further strengthened. The work of compensating for the losses in the disaster-stricken areas has begun on the basis of the achieved victory.

Third, the implementation of the unified purchase and supply policy. After the state implemented the unified purchase and supply policy, for the peasants as a whole, the benefits obtained are: the elimination of private merchants and rich peasants' intermediate exploitation, the guarantee of stable prices, the ability of peasants to buy relatively cheap industrial products, and the increase in actual income. For the poor peasants among the peasants, there are additional benefits, which is fundamentally changing the difficult situation of having to sell cheaply in autumn and buy expensively in spring. The peasants, after experiencing land reform to obtain land, to be exempt from rent, and to increase a large sum of income; today, the implementation of unified purchase and supply, the elimination of intermediate exploitation, has obtained another large sum of income; these two sums of income are used to build land, increase production, and improve yields, and will obtain an even larger sum of income. The recent increase in the purchasing power of the peasants reflects the change in the entire economic system that is beneficial to the peasants. The benefits of the unified purchase and supply policy for the peasants can also be seen more clearly from the reflections of the people in the flood-stricken areas this year. In the old days, where there was a flood disaster, there the grain price would skyrocket, the rich would take advantage of the disaster to exploit and annex, and the poor would be ruined by the disaster and go bankrupt. This situation has been repeated countless times in history. After this flood disaster, the grain price did not rise at all, and the grain supply was fully guaranteed. The phenomenon of polarization between the rich and the poor did not occur. The peasants all said: This is a world we have never seen before. It is very clear that the peasant masses have obtained real benefits from the government's measures, and the government's measures will naturally receive their active support and support.

However, why do some peasants still have some opinions about the unified purchase and supply work? In our actual work, there are indeed some shortcomings, which is one reason. The purchase and supply system lacks a strict investigation and statistical work basis, although the national purchase and supply figures are generally in line with reality, but when distributed to the lower levels, there will inevitably be imbalances between areas and between households, especially when estimating the specific sales figures of individual households, it is difficult to be very accurate, and it is easy to deviate from reality. Such shortcomings are understandable and reasonable in a new system that is just being established and formed, and in a vast and economically dispersed countryside. It is understandable and reasonable that some peasants have opinions. But this is only one reason, and it is not the main reason. In addition, there is a more important reason, which is that a part of the relatively rich peasants have the habit of demanding free trade, which conflicts with the state's planned economic system. The size of this resistance sentiment is closely related to the depth of influence of local village capitalist forces and the size of achievements of socialist measures, as well as the good or bad of our political work. Experience has proved that when we firmly rely on the poor peasants, solidly unite the middle peasants, correctly implement the policy of restricting rich peasants, strengthen ideological work among the masses, and strive to do well in various socialist economic measures, thereby establishing the political and economic superiority of socialism in the countryside, the resistance sentiment of some peasants to the unified purchase and supply policy will gradually decrease and even completely disappear, otherwise it will be difficult to eliminate or eliminate it slowly. This shows that the unified purchase and supply policy is fundamentally beneficial and harmless to the peasants. Some peasants' resistance sentiment to the unified purchase and supply policy does not indicate that their economic interests conflict with this socialist new measure, but only indicates that their spontaneous habits conflict with this measure. This resistance sentiment can be helped to eliminate with appropriate methods. If not helped to eliminate, it is not beneficial to the party and the government's unity with the peasants, and it is even more not beneficial to the peasants' further improvement of their lives. To believe that the unified purchase and supply measures are incompatible with the peasants' demands and to want to abolish this socialist measure and return to the old system that harms the peasants, making the peasants suffer again from various pains they have already suffered, this is of course extremely wrong.

Fourth, the implementation of universal suffrage and the establishment of the People's Congress system. After universal suffrage in the countryside, self-criticism and criticism were carried out, more laboring people were widely involved in the management of political power, a large number of active elements of the masses were promoted, some bad people were dealt with, many good things were done, some bad things were corrected, and the people's democratic dictatorship was consolidated from all aspects. In addition, the promulgation of the constitution has fixed the general task of our country's transition to a socialist society and the various rights enjoyed by the laboring people by law. All these have caused great excitement among the peasants.

The work carried out in the countryside over the past year, of course, is not limited to the above few items. The material and cultural well-being of the peasants is gradually being satisfied, which is closely related to and inseparable from the gradual progress of the country's overall economic and cultural construction. Therefore, with the development of the country's economy, the cultural and educational undertakings have also developed, enabling the children of peasants to go to school. The pain of being illiterate that the peasants have suffered in the past will no longer be suffered by their children. Just this one thing has caused them great joy. Of course, the laboring peasants' requirements and hopes for the party and the people's government will not stop at the current level. They are putting forward further requirements and hopes. They hope that the socialist cause will develop more comprehensively, rapidly develop industry, and obtain more industrial products, because today the supply of industrial products is obviously not keeping up with the growing demand of the countryside. They hope that the various works that have been started can be done better, because there are still many shortcomings in our work. The few items of work that the peasants are most concerned about at present, such as smoothing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, consolidating and developing the economic cooperation of production cooperatives, further rationalizing and institutionalizing the unified purchase and supply work, need our attention first. At the same time, the shortcomings of various works must be firmly improved.

When the peasant masses feel that the party and the people's government are so deeply concerned about their personal interests, they will also raise their concern for the public interests of the whole people. Countless times of struggle experience has educated the peasants, and they have already understood or will further understand the following truth: without the interests of the whole, there is no personal interest. For their material, cultural, and political interests, the peasants must strive to implement the national construction plan, must strive to develop agriculture to support industrial construction, and must wholeheartedly support the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan. The motherland needs what, we will contribute what, if it needs soldiers, we will provide soldiers, if it needs grain, we will provide grain, if it needs strength, we will provide strength.

Our enemies are using every means to sow discord between workers and peasants. The Chinese peasants, who have been tempered by the revolution, like the people of the whole country, understand the intentions of these enemies. Therefore, they will more sincerely accept the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, accept the leadership of the people's government, and work even harder to consolidate the unity and cooperation with the working class, making the enemies fall into complete and thorough failure.

The solid worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of the people's democratic united front. The peasants of the whole country will definitely not relax in consolidating the great unity of the people, and will definitely not show mercy in fighting resolutely against the domestic and foreign enemies who sabotage our cause, ensuring the ultimate victory of our great socialist construction.

Fang Dingying's Speech

I have listened to Vice Chairman Chen Chutong's work report, Commissioner Zhang Boqian's explanation of the draft constitution of this conference, and Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's report, and I feel very excited. I agree with and support these reports and explanations. In the past few years, our country has made great progress and remarkable achievements in politics, economy, and culture, which powerfully demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic system and also shows that the Chinese people, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have displayed unprecedented creativity and initiative.

Now the task of the people of the whole country is to build our motherland into a great socialist country. All our work is carried out around this great goal. However, the American imperialists and the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to Taiwan, are most afraid of our success in socialist construction. They are constantly using despicable means to sabotage us and attempt to restore themselves in China. Recently, they have become even more brazen, disregarding the just public opinion of the world and our firm opposition, and have even dared to sign the so-called "U.S.-Chiang Mutual Defense Treaty," attempting to instigate a new war. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. Taiwan is an inseparable part of our country. As long as Taiwan is not liberated, our territory will not be complete, and our peaceful construction environment will not be secure, and the peace and security of East Asia and the world will not be guaranteed. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and will not rest until the goal is achieved. Therefore, I wholeheartedly support the statement made by Foreign Minister Zhou on December 8, and I am willing to dedicate all my strength, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, to strive for the liberation of Taiwan and the complete annihilation of the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek.

Chen Chutong's Speech

Chairman, Members of the Committee:

I fully agree with the work report of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and I support Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report. In the past five years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, have achieved unprecedented great achievements. This achievement is inseparable from the consolidation and development of the Chinese people's democratic united front. This year, the first session of the First National People's Congress, held in September, stipulated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China: "In the future, in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general tasks of the transitional period of the state and to fight against internal and external enemies, our people's democratic united front will continue to play its role." This session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference fully demonstrates the breadth and expansion of our people's democratic united front. As for the representatives of the industrial and commercial circles participating in the conference, they also have representativeness from all aspects of the industrial and commercial circles, embodying what Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the report on the draft constitution: "Due to the special historical conditions of our country, between the working class and the national bourgeoisie, there is not only struggle, but also an alliance that has existed and still exists." The working class and the national bourgeoisie still have an alliance because, in the transitional period, the national bourgeoisie still has an important role in the national economy. In expanding production, improving enterprise management and production technology, training and cultivating workers and technical personnel, and accepting socialist transformation, they can still make a certain contribution to the state. Therefore, in the transitional period, the national bourgeoisie also has a certain position in politics.

The people have given us such an honorable position, and at the same time, they have given us such an honorable task. We should contribute our strength in the cause of socialist construction. First of all, we must actively accept socialist transformation, seriously combine the transformation of enterprises with the transformation of individuals. We should realize that the purpose of the alliance between the working class and the national bourgeoisie is not to preserve the system of exploitation, but to take the peaceful road, adopt various forms of state capitalism, gradually replace capitalist ownership with full public ownership, and eliminate the system of exploitation. Through the lessons of reality in the past few years and the widespread and in-depth propaganda and education of the general tasks of the transitional period and the state constitution, many industrial and commercial people have raised their awareness and expressed their willingness to accept socialist transformation, which also shows that we industrial and commercial people can play an active and beneficial role under the leadership of the working class. However, there will definitely be struggles in the process of socialist transformation. There are struggles now, and there will be struggles in the future. All illegal acts that harm public interests, disrupt social and economic order, and sabotage national economic plans must be severely fought against. We have not done enough in this aspect of education in the past, and we must strengthen our work in the future.

Members of the Committee, 1955 is the third year of our country's first five-year plan and will be a year of continued significant progress in the cause of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Therefore, the task of socialist transformation of the industrial and commercial circles is even more arduous. We will assist the state organs, use our organizational strength, strengthen patriotic and law-abiding education, encourage and strive to transform as many industrial and commercial enterprises as possible into various forms of state capitalist economy, and according to objective development, guide industrial enterprises to the higher forms of state capitalism, promote the transformation of commerce row by row and industry by industry. This is the main work of the industrial and commercial federation in the future. In the past, our efforts in this regard have been insufficient, especially in the combination of enterprise transformation and personal transformation. Of course, there are difficulties in the process of transformation, but we should understand that these difficulties are unavoidable difficulties in the process of advancement. To ensure the victory of socialist transformation, we must, under the leadership of the state organs, cooperate with all forces, do our best to carry out our work.

The more our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation cause progresses, the more crazily the enemy will be hostile and sabotage us. To prevent the enemy from sabotaging our socialist construction and to defend our great achievements of the people's revolution, we industrial and commercial people must maintain a high degree of vigilance and persist in the struggle against internal and external enemies. We industrial and commercial people must remember to sincerely accept socialist transformation, actively operate, overcome difficulties, although this is something the enemy does not like, but it is exactly what we should do for the people. Chairman Mao, as early as the preparatory meeting of the Political Consultative Conference in 1949, warned us: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their failure in China. They will still conspire together and use all possible means to oppose the Chinese people." The past five years have completely proven the correctness of Chairman Mao's scientific foresight. After the armistice in Korea and the restoration of peace in Indochina, American imperialism has not accepted the lessons of failure. Recently, it has even brazenly signed the so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, attempting to use Taiwan as a base to expand its aggression against China and prepare for a new war, once again proving that the enemy is determined to sabotage our socialist construction. We guarantee to the conference: We will call on all industrial and commercial people to support the solemn statement of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on the U.S.-Chiang treaty with actual actions; we will call on all industrial and commercial people to enthusiastically subscribe to the 1955 national economic construction bonds to accelerate the socialist construction of the state and give a resolute counterattack to the internal and external enemies. We must liberate Taiwan.

We must liberate Taiwan to safeguard peace and to complete socialist construction on the basis of peace. As a component of the people's democratic united front, the industrial and commercial circles of the whole country must firmly stand under the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class, abide by the principles of the Political Consultative Conference, strengthen and consolidate the people's democratic united front, and work together with the people of the whole country to strive for the elimination of exploitation and poverty and the construction of a prosperous and happy socialist society.

Ma Xulun's Speech

Chairman, Members of the Committee:

I speak on behalf of the China Democratic Promotion Association.

I fully agree with and support Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai's political report. All members of the China Democratic Promotion Association guarantee that under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, we will work together with the people of the whole country to resolutely complete and implement the current tasks indicated by Vice Chairman Zhou and strive to the end.

The American aggressors are extremely vicious and have even colluded with the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek, who is hiding in Taiwan, to sign the so-called "mutual defense treaty." This illegal treaty of aggression is not only an infringement on the sovereignty and territory of the People's Republic of China, but also a brutal interference in China's internal affairs, and it also seriously threatens the security of China and the peace of Asia. The Chinese people who have stood up will not tolerate such threats and provocations from American imperialism.

This is a replica of the "Japan-China Treaty of Betrayal." American imperialism has decided to be an enemy of the Chinese people for a long time. The traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek has willingly become a traitorous puppet of American imperialism. However, history will not repeat itself. Japanese imperialism established "Manchukuo" more than twenty years ago and established the puppet government of Wang Jingwei more than ten years ago, but it was eventually crushed by the Chinese people. How can it be allowed to repeat the shame of "Manchukuo" today? The Chinese people have already been liberated, and the power of the Chinese people is becoming stronger and stronger. Can we allow the shame of "Manchukuo" to be repeated? The Chinese people have crushed the aggression of Japanese imperialism and have trampled on the traitors Puyi and Wang Jingwei. The Chinese people today have more power and confidence and will definitely crush the conspiracy of the American aggressors who are following the old path of Japan, and will definitely smash the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who recognizes the enemy as his father. The Chinese people will not rest until Taiwan is liberated!

The Chinese people cannot tolerate such a humiliation as the U.S.-Chiang aggression treaty. The people of the whole country have unanimously risen up, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, vowing to fight to the end to wash away the humiliation. As long as Taiwan is not liberated, our great cause of liberation will not be completed; as long as Taiwan is not liberated, our socialist construction, which is being successfully carried out, will be obstructed; as long as Taiwan is not liberated, our security and the peace of Asia will not be guaranteed.

We also fully understand that the struggle to liberate Taiwan is a difficult struggle. Therefore, the people of the whole country must be vigilant and not be complacent, under the leadership of the Communist Party, work together, unite as one, and concentrate all our strength from our respective positions to engage in this arduous struggle and complete our sacred task. We have the experience of driving the American imperialists and the traitorous clique of Chiang Kai-shek out of the mainland. We have the glorious victory experience of the great movement to support Korea and resist the United States. We have the great Communist Party of China, which leads us forward, the invincible iron-like People's Liberation Army, the solid and united people's democratic united front, and the selfless assistance of the brotherly countries led by the great Soviet Union and the support of the people of the world who love peace. We have no doubt that we will achieve the final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 25th.

Over the past five years, the people of our entire nation have been united under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Today, as we engage in the struggle to liberate Taiwan and build socialism, we must unite even more closely around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We must be vigilant against the enemy's lies, provocations, and sabotage. We must be alert day and night and not allow the enemy to find any loopholes. Over the past five years, our various democratic parties have made significant progress in distinguishing between friend and foe and in ideological reform. However, we must not be complacent. Our country is progressing rapidly. We are still far from the level required by our country. Our responsibilities are arduous, especially during this period of socialist transformation, when class struggle is intense. We must prevent the possibility of the already eliminated reactionary class rising from the ashes. We must also be seriously vigilant against the few die-hard elements in the class that is being eliminated, who are trying to sabotage our sacred socialist cause. Each of us must further strictly demand of ourselves and use the methods of criticism and self-criticism to continually overcome our shortcomings and improve our standards. Only in this way can the great unity of the people of the entire nation be further consolidated.

Thanks to the guidance and leadership of the Communist Party of China, our motherland has fundamentally changed its appearance in just a few short years. As a Chinese person, I am seventy years old and have never felt as proud as I do today. Naturally, in these five years, we have only taken a small step. An endless expanse of happy future lies before us. This requires all of us to redouble our efforts, unite as one, and follow the Communist Party of China forward to achieve our ultimate goal.

Comrades, I am filled with boundless excitement as I look forward to the future of our great motherland, which is changing every day. This also arouses our immense anger against the illegal treaty of aggression signed by the Americans and the Kuomintang. We must smash this evil treaty of aggression. Our territory and sovereignty are inviolable, our internal affairs are not to be interfered with, and our sacred socialist cause is not to be threatened or sabotaged. We must liberate Taiwan. The invincible strength of 600 million people united as one is unbreakable. The imperialists of America and their puppet, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, dare to provoke the 600 million Chinese people who have stood up. As the Chinese saying goes, "A mayfly shaking a great tree is laughable and does not know its own limitations!"

Comrade Su Tuo-tang's speech:

Chairman, Comrades:

Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report and Comrade Chen Chutong's report on the work of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as Comrade Zhang Boqian's explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, are all excellent. In particular, Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report has been of great help to us, and I fully endorse these reports.

I am a delegate from the overseas Chinese community, and I would like to share some of my thoughts and some of my shallow opinions.

Since the liberation of the motherland, the national economy has rapidly recovered, and at the same time, a series of social reforms have been successfully completed. The movement to resist America and aid Korea has achieved great victories, and there have been brilliant achievements in economic construction. Our country's policy of peaceful foreign relations and international activities have had a great impact, and our country's international status has rapidly risen. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, our motherland has, in such a short time, become so united, strong, and prosperous, which truly makes overseas Chinese feel boundless excitement and pride, and greatly inspires the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese, promoting the great unity of overseas Chinese.

Overseas Chinese have a deep hatred for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. During the period of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, not only did the people at home suffer deep oppression, but overseas Chinese also suffered the same evil disasters caused by the Kuomintang bandits. Therefore, when the people of the motherland launched the struggle to liberate Taiwan, they immediately gained the enthusiastic support of overseas Chinese. Recently, the American imperialists signed a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which in fact aims to make the criminal act of occupying Taiwan "legal" and to use Taiwan as a military base for their aggressive war of invasion and plunder in Asia. Anyone with a brain can see clearly that this treaty is a blatant war treaty of the American imperialist clique to accelerate the invasion of Asia. This treaty is the most shameless treaty of betrayal of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which has been betraying the country for twenty-seven years. This treaty can be summed up in four words: war and betrayal. For the safety of the motherland and the integrity of the motherland's territory, we must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The armed forces of the United States must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. The broad masses of overseas Chinese enthusiastically support the motherland's struggle to liberate Taiwan. Patriotic overseas Chinese are also fighting to expose and smash the plots of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique among overseas Chinese, expanding unity, consolidating unity and mutual aid, and striving to promote friendly relations with the local people.

Next, I would like to talk about some issues related to overseas Chinese affairs. Over the past five years, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the relevant departments of the motherland government have all achieved due results in their work on overseas Chinese affairs, such as protecting the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, facilitating remittances, settling returned and distressed overseas Chinese, handling the admission of overseas Chinese students, guiding the production of relatives of overseas Chinese, redeeming savings from before liberation, and uniting the broad masses of overseas Chinese around the motherland. In these aspects, active work has been done. All these have made the broad masses of overseas Chinese feel grateful to the government of the People's Republic of China, and have further strengthened their unity and patriotic beliefs.

However, due to various objective reasons and insufficient subjective efforts, I personally feel that there are still some problems in the work of overseas Chinese that need to be solved urgently. If these problems can be solved quickly, it will not only be beneficial to overseas Chinese but also have a positive impact on the socialist construction of the motherland.

First, there is the issue of correctly implementing the policy on remittances. Over the past five years, the motherland government has implemented the policy of "facilitating remittances and serving overseas Chinese," which is correct. Under this policy, the relevant departments of the government have formulated a series of specific policies to facilitate remittances over the past five years, such as the preferential exchange rate for remittances and the original currency remittance and original currency deposit methods, ensuring that the relatives of overseas Chinese do not suffer losses due to currency fluctuations. These measures have been supported by the broad masses of overseas Chinese. However, as far as I know, there are still some local and township cadres who have insufficient understanding of the remittance policy. I hope that the relevant departments will pay attention to this in the future.

Second, there is the issue of the Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. In the past, it has done a lot of work and achieved many results, but there are still some shortcomings. In the future, in addition to the Federation's own efforts, I hope that the relevant departments will pay attention to and guide the work of the Federation.

Our country and people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, truly have a limitless bright and happy future. The people's democratic united front has played a major role in the process of the Chinese revolution, precisely because there has been the leadership of the Communist Party of China. I think we, the members of the Political Consultative Conference, as long as we sincerely follow the Communist Party, sincerely serve the people, we will definitely be more united, and we will definitely be able to mobilize more strength to strive for the construction of our happy motherland. I sincerely wish the conference a great success!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong!

Comrade Luo Longji's speech:

Chairman, Comrades:

Today, I represent the China Democratic League to support Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report, agree with Comrade Chen Chutong's report on the work of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and support Comrade Zhang Boqian's explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Over the past five years, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the great Chairman Mao Zedong, has done a lot of work for the construction of various state affairs and for the struggle to defend world peace internationally, and has achieved brilliant results. The various democratic parties and people's organizations participating in the Political Consultative Conference have not only been consolidated but also strengthened. This has laid a good foundation for the expansion and development of the Chinese people's democratic united front today. Today, I, on behalf of the China Democratic League, express my deep gratitude to our leading party, the Communist Party of China, and to the great Chairman Mao!

Comrades, today, in front of the Chinese people, and also in front of this conference, there are two important tasks: first, to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Kuomintang bandits; second, to achieve socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. The China Democratic League is a unit that signed the joint declaration to liberate Taiwan issued on August 22. After the publication of our declaration, the American imperialist clique actually signed a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Kuomintang bandits, which is a further serious war provocation to our Chinese people. Today, I, on behalf of the China Democratic League, solemnly declare once again: we will definitely unite more strongly with various democratic parties and people's organizations and fully implement our joint declaration. Today, we want to tell Eisenhower and Dulles of the United States: war will not intimidate the Chinese people! The 600 million Chinese people, who have undergone long-term revolutionary war training, have the strength, determination, and confidence to smash the Sino-American "treaty" and eliminate the Kuomintang bandits to liberate Taiwan.

Regarding the socialist transformation, from the perspective of the work position of the China Democratic League, it is to redouble our efforts to promote the ideological transformation of Chinese middle and upper-class intellectuals. First of all, we enthusiastically welcome and support the current vigorous criticism of Hu Shi's thoughts and the settlement of Anglo-American bourgeois thoughts in the academic circles. This is a very important work in the ideological transformation of Chinese intellectuals.

Over the past few years, Chinese intellectuals have learned Marxist theory, and it can be said that they have achieved results. Marxist thought has spread widely in China! Chinese intellectuals, after several years of learning, generally speaking, have made some progress. However, we must admit that in the past, we have not done enough in criticizing and settling the Anglo-American bourgeois thoughts of Chinese intellectuals. Because of this reason, some people's learning may only be wearing a Marxist coat over the experimentalist suit made by Bentham of Britain and Dewey of the United States. Such learning cannot solve the problem of ideological transformation.

Today's Chinese intellectuals, especially middle and upper-class intellectuals, generally speaking, are those who grew up in the old society, and they have all, directly or indirectly, been influenced by Anglo-American bourgeois thoughts. I am such a person myself. Old intellectuals, the reason they are great, is that they have a lot of old thoughts; old high-level intellectuals, the reason they are high, is that they have high-level old thoughts. There is a Chinese saying: "First come, first served." This high and great old thought fortress built in a person's mind becomes a great obstacle to accepting new things. These high and great old thought fortresses left in society will definitely hinder our socialist transformation. Our ideological transformation must first break through this fortress, demolish this fortress, and clear this fortress. Everyone must still remember that in the past, Han Yu of the Tang Dynasty said two sentences: "If you don't block it, it won't flow; if you don't stop it, it won't go." I borrow these two sentences to illustrate our current ideological struggle. We must settle the Anglo-American bourgeois thoughts in intellectuals to consolidate the position of Marxist theory in the socialist transformation of China.

Hu Shi is a typical representative of Anglo-American bourgeois thoughts. Hu Shi himself is now in exile in the United States, but the thoughts he represents are undoubtedly still hidden in the minds of many intellectuals in China. Hu Shi's thoughts in China are not limited to the mind of Mr. Yu Pingbo. Everyone must still remember that in the past, there was a popular saying: "My friend Hu Shi." How intimate that sentence is! Now, of course, no one says this sentence anymore. But politically distinguishing between friend and foe does not mean ideologically distinguishing between friend and foe. As long as the ideological distinction between friend and foe is not made, as long as Anglo-American bourgeois thoughts are still rampant in the cerebral cortex, this person is still making friends with Hu Shi. To truly break up with Hu Shi, one must completely cut off relations with Anglo-American bourgeois thoughts, completely cut off relations, cleanly cut off relations!

Now, many schools are advocating scientific research, that is, using scientific methods to study practical problems. This change in academic style, we approve of, we welcome. However, the criticism of Hu Shi's thoughts and scientific research should be combined to do, this is very helpful for the ideological transformation of intellectuals. We must first criticize Hu Shi's thoughts, and then scientific research will not go astray on the erroneous path of idealism and go down the wrong path. We will not spend thirty years studying the Dream of the Red Chamber and have a dream for thirty whole years. Learning Marxist theory and scientific research combined, this is the unity of theory and practice. In this way, our learning will not be static and isolated learning of Marxism, our research will be the research of using Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods. In this way, our scientific research will definitely make a great contribution to the economic and cultural construction of China!

Finally, I stand on this platform of the People's Political Consultative Conference and call on Chinese intellectuals to participate in the work of criticizing Hu Shi's thoughts and settling Anglo-American bourgeois thoughts, and to do a good job of scientific research work. Chinese intellectuals, let's all work hard to do these two things well, and our ideological transformation will be on the road to victory!

Comrade Li Zhechen's speech:

Chairman, Comrades:

I am very excited to feel that over the past five years, the organization of the Chinese people's democratic united front—the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference—under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, has done its work in the people's cause and achieved brilliant results. The greatest and most glorious achievement is to mobilize and unite the people of the whole country to fight for the defense of the motherland's security and the defense of world peace in the resistance against America and aid to Korea, thereby arousing the patriotic and internationalist spirit of the people of the whole country, promoting the construction of the country, various social reform movements, and ideological transformation work, and preparing the necessary conditions for building and transforming China into a great socialist country.

The victory of China's socialist construction and socialist transformation is something that American imperialism does not like, and they are even more unwilling to accept the shameful defeats they suffered on the battlefield and in diplomatic negotiations, attempting to use the threat of war to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. Recently, they have even shamelessly signed a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique that fled to Taiwan. The Chinese people understand that only by opposing aggression can peace be defended, so we will not be intimidated by the threat of war and will not tolerate this act of violating territorial sovereignty. We must liberate Taiwan from the tyranny of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

The Chinese people have sufficient strength to achieve victory in resisting the aggressive actions of American imperialism. At the same time, the power of the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union is becoming stronger and stronger, forming a strong fortress for defending world peace; the peace-loving people of the world, including the broad masses of the United States, have launched the peace and democracy movement, exerting tremendous power to stop aggressive wars and fighting against the fascist reactionary forces of a small number of imperialist countries. I have participated in the peace and democracy movement conferences in Vienna and Stockholm, especially at the "World Peace People's Conference" in Vienna, where eighty-five countries participated, and not a single representative did not denounce the crimes of American imperialism in enslaving the people of various countries. Some representatives even shed tears in the meeting hall. This is a strong flame of people's anger burning there, and I saw these situations with my own eyes, which made me realize that such a strong and united force is invincible. If the warmongers of imperialism dare to launch a war, they will surely be crushed in the face of such a strong force. The imperialist aggressors are not boasting that they have thousands of military bases around the world? They will eventually understand that the people who love peace surrounding these bases will be the force to destroy these bases. We are in a favorable situation in our struggle against American imperialist aggression, but at the same time, we should not overlook the arduousness and long-term nature of this struggle. In the arduous and long-term struggle, there will inevitably be difficulties, but we can overcome them, while American imperialism is facing numerous difficulties, and according to the laws of social development, they will not be able to solve their own difficulties. We must see the situation of victory, with the confidence of victory, and we must redouble our efforts with one heart and one mind to achieve our victory.

Over the past five years, the Chinese national bourgeoisie has participated in the patriotic movement against American imperialist aggression in the people's democratic united front, and has made a certain contribution in the anti-American aid-Korean and national defense demonstrations held in various cities across the country, and in the movement to donate aircraft and artillery. In the current international situation, it is even more necessary for us to further carry forward the spirit of patriotism, unite with the people of the whole country, and strive to strengthen our unity around the Communist Party of China and the people's government, contribute our strength, and with practical actions, participate in the struggle against the American imperialists' collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to invade our country's territorial sovereignty, support the liberation of our country's territory of Taiwan, complete the unification of the motherland, and further carry forward the patriotic spirit of industrial and commercial circles. Therefore, we must adapt to the requirements of the general task of the transitional period of the state, stand on our own posts, and play a positive and beneficial role in the national economy and people's livelihood. First of all, we must truly love the country and abide by the law, obey the management of the state administrative organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, and accept the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce adopted by the state. On the basis of loving the country and abiding by the law, we need to work hard to reform the production, operation, and management of enterprises, actively create conditions, proactively overcome difficulties, and put the enterprises on the track of state capitalism, accept socialist transformation, tap potential, and create more wealth for the state. What is more important for us is to combine enterprise reform with improving our own understanding, and seriously carry out personal ideological transformation. However, ideological transformation is not a matter of "suddenly enlightenment," but rather a matter of deep understanding and comparison in the face of new people and new things in the process of one's own learning and practice after the enterprise has embarked on the track of state capitalism. For example, after embarking on the track of state capitalism, especially after the joint operation of the enterprise, why is there such a great change in production? This is of course due to the change in the production relations, which has improved labor productivity, and all management and operation, because the socialist elements in the enterprise are in a leading position, can be improved more necessarily. However, in the joint-venture enterprises, both the public and private sides have places that need attention and improvement. On the part of the capitalists and their agents, most of them have a sense of inferiority, thinking that the capitalist system will eventually be abolished (the fact is to eliminate the system of exploitation, not to eliminate the individual capitalists), so they shrink back and watch from the sidelines, which is wrong, and they should obey the leadership, fulfill their duties, and contribute their technology and abilities to the fullest, while learning seriously and determinedly to transform themselves and open up a bright future. On the part of the government cadres, some have a sense of superiority, and do not pay enough attention to and do enough to educate and transform the personnel of the capitalist side, which also needs to be improved. I hope that the government cadres will, with the spirit of benevolence, strengthen the leadership and education of the personnel of the capitalist side, so that they can be inspired to strive for progress, which is a matter of immediate effect. At the same time, the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce should also provide continuous help and encouragement according to the situation of private industry and commerce, and explain and criticize the idea of slacking off after the enterprise has been transformed and relying passively on the state, and for those who have the idea of resisting transformation or behavior, they need to be educated and dealt with seriously. If so, the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce will definitely produce positive and beneficial effects.

Comrades! The people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, are struggling against American imperialist aggression, defending the security of the motherland and world peace, and struggling to build our country into a great socialist country. As a part of the Chinese people's democratic united front, the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce need to educate and help their members to accept the dual transformation of enterprises and individuals, and closely connect with the industrial and commercial masses, contribute more strength, and with practical actions, support the liberation of Taiwan, and strive for the defense of the socialist construction and socialist transformation of the motherland!

Comrade Xu Deheng's speech:

Chairman, Comrades:

I participated in this conference, listened to Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report, and the report on the work of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference by Comrade Chen Chutong, and I, on behalf of the September 3rd Society, express my enthusiastic support and agreement.

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has been established for more than five years. Over the past five years, the people of the whole country have achieved unprecedented brilliant victories on all fronts, and are now marching forward with full confidence towards the future of socialism. The First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has done tremendous work in various aspects during this period, played an important role, and gloriously completed its historical mission. The people's democratic united front led by the Communist Party of China has been unprecedentedly consolidated and expanded, and now, on this basis, the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is convened, which is an important sign of the further strengthening and expansion of the unity of the people of the whole country.

Comrades! The most urgent task facing us is to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Everyone knows that the American aggressors recently signed a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek, attempting to long-term occupy our country's territory of Taiwan and further use Taiwan as a military base to launch aggression and start a new war of aggression. After the signing of this "treaty," the American aggressors shamelessly criticized our country's government's just decision to sentence thirteen American spies, attempting to cover up the evil Sino-American treaty, deceive the people of the world, and use rogue tactics to pressure the Chinese students who are still in the United States. The American aggressors openly support the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek, who has been spit on by the Chinese people, to destroy our country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, interfere in our country's internal affairs, endanger the peace of Asia and the world, and their aggressive behavior is absolutely intolerable to the 600 million people of our country. We must liberate Taiwan, recover all the territories occupied by the United States, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and will not rest until the goal is achieved. The war threats of the American aggressors will not intimidate the Chinese people, but will only increase the deeper hatred of the Chinese people. All our members resolutely unite with the people of the whole country to strengthen work in all aspects and contribute all our strength to the liberation of Taiwan.

Comrades, the seven "principles" stipulated in the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are the principles that we must jointly abide by, and we must strive to achieve them with all our strength. The seventh principle states: "Learn the theory of Marxism-Leninism, learn the policies of the state, improve political level, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and strive for ideological transformation," which has more significant meaning for us. It should be pointed out that the consolidation and development of the people's democratic united front in our country is an important condition for the continuous improvement of the ideological level of all members of the united front. Over the past five years, our intellectuals have made significant progress in their ideological level through various political movements and learning, which is commendable, but it has not yet been widely and deeply spread to the field of academic thought. In many academic departments and many academic workers, bourgeois idealism still dominates. The harm of Hu Shi's bourgeois idealism to classical literature research, as reflected in the "Red Chamber Dream Research Institute," is only an outstanding example. Since the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shi has consistently been a spokesman for imperialism, a strategist for feudal warlords, and finally degenerated into a war criminal in the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Many cultural and academic comrades have long recognized Hu Shi's reactionary political face, but have often been unaware of Hu Shi's reactionary academic thoughts, and some have even been captured by this thought in academic work. The call of the leading party to criticize Hu Shi's bourgeois idealism is a timely alarm for the entire cultural and academic community. The current serious task of intellectuals is to, under the call of the party, on the basis of existing achievements, push forward ideological transformation, and penetrate into the field of academic work and academic thought. The members of the September 3rd Society engaged in academic research work, some of whom have been captured by bourgeois thoughts, and we have not noticed this for a long time, which shows that our work and learning have not been done well. We, all members and the cultural and academic workers we are connected with, should now actively and enthusiastically join this great ideological struggle, carry out in-depth and systematic learning and discussion in the fields of literature, philosophy, history, politics, economics, and natural sciences, seriously criticize bourgeois idealist thoughts, and better complete the glorious task of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of the country.

I wish the conference a complete success!

Comrade Guo Ti'an's speech:

Chairman, Comrades:

I fully agree with and enthusiastically support Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report, Comrade Chen Chutong's report on the work of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Comrade Zhang Boqian's explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

I am very excited and happy to participate in the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Over the past five years, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, has achieved brilliant results in various social reform movements, in the struggle to defend the security of the motherland and world peace in the resistance against America and aid to Korea, in mobilizing the people to participate in the construction of politics, economy, and culture, in consolidating and expanding the united front organization, and in carrying out ideological transformation work. Now, the Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been promulgated, and the basic contents of the Common Program have been included in the Constitution. The preamble of the Constitution states: "In the future, in mobilizing and uniting the people of the whole country to complete the general task of the transitional period of the state and the struggle against internal and external enemies, the people's democratic united front of our country will continue to play its role."

Our country is a multi-ethnic country with a population of 600 million. Through various patriotic movements and ideological education, the awareness of the people of our country has been improved, and an unprecedented unity of the people of the whole country has emerged. The international status of our country has also undergone great changes, especially this year, Premier Zhou's visit to Geneva to participate in an important conference has been highly valued by various countries, and his visits to India and Burma have resulted in the joint declaration of the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence" with the Prime Ministers of India and Burma. The countries of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp led by the Soviet Union have shown internationalist unity and friendship over the years, and have also achieved results in the world peace and democracy movement. We must strive to win the support of the peace-loving people of the world and achieve greater victories, and further strengthen international unity and friendship.

Our country was in a very bad situation for a long time before liberation, and agriculture and industry were both very backward. The majority of the people did not have enough to eat or wear, and lived a very poor and difficult life under various oppressions. Since liberation, the production of industry and agriculture has far exceeded the highest records in history, and culture, education, water conservancy, transportation, and other new constructions have developed greatly. The living standards of the people, especially the broad masses of workers and peasants, have improved. Last year, the government proposed the general task of the transitional period. The work in front of us is very arduous and difficult. The people of the whole country must be more united and work harder to contribute their greatest strength to build our China into a great country with a high level of industrialization and culture.

The Chinese national bourgeoisie has participated in various patriotic movements in the people's democratic united front and has made a certain contribution to the country and the people. We must play a role that is beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, and we must achieve genuine patriotism and law-abiding, obey the leadership of the state-owned economy, accept the supervision of the working masses, and accept the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce adopted by the state. We must work hard to improve the production, operation, and management of enterprises, actively create conditions, proactively overcome difficulties, and put the enterprises on the track of state capitalism, accept socialist transformation, tap potential, and create more wealth for the state. We must accept socialist transformation, combine enterprise transformation with personal transformation, and more and more industrial and commercial people are willing to accept socialist transformation. This year, many foreign dignitaries have visited China, and when Dr. Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Assembly of the People's Republic of Romania, visited Shanghai, he also had a friendly talk with us, telling us about the revolutionary struggle history of Romania, and about the ideological transformation and socialist transformation of capitalist industrial and commercial people, which gave the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles great education and encouragement. Dr. Groza was once a big capitalist, founding and managing many large enterprises and factories, but he accepted the transformation happily and is now participating in important work of the Romanian government, serving his country and people. We Chinese industrial and commercial people should learn from Dr. Groza's example, accept enterprise transformation and personal transformation, and private joint-venture industries must complete the processing tasks on time, in quality, and in quantity. I think it is not enough to just complete the processing tasks, and we should be more active and strive to accumulate more funds, follow the state plan, and set up new factories in the interior to produce more and better industrial products to meet the increasing needs of the people of the whole country year by year.

Taiwan is our territory, and we, the industrial and commercial circles, must, together with the people of the whole country, heighten our vigilance, prevent the sabotage of domestic and foreign enemies, and contribute our greatest strength to support the liberation of Taiwan.

Comrades, the achievements of our country in the past five years are great, and our future is bright and even greater. Let us, the people of the whole country, be more united around the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, work harder, and strive for the construction of socialism and the transition to a socialist society!

Comrade Panchen Erdeni's speech:

Chairman, Comrades, Ladies and Gentlemen:

The convening of the First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is completely necessary and timely at present, and I am honored to be able to participate in this conference. Today, I would like to, on behalf of the Tibetan monks and laypeople, wish the conference a successful victory.

Since the Chinese people overthrew the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek and achieved the great victory of liberation, various ethnic groups, various classes, various parties, and various organizations have, for the common governance of our country, the restoration and development of our economic construction, the defense of our victory achievements, and the continuous improvement and improvement of the cultural and material life of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, formed the Political Consultative Conference. The conference elected the leading organs of the state, adopted the Common Program that is unanimously supported and strictly followed by the broad masses of the people. Over the past few years, under the guidance of the Common Program, the people of all ethnic groups in the country have been more united, solid, and closely united than ever before. Our Tibetan people have thus ended the history of oppression and discrimination and, like the people of all ethnic groups in the country, enjoy equal rights.

Our motherland is thriving and becoming stronger day by day, which is earth-shaking. The achievements we have made in all aspects are great. The First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has completed its glorious historical mission. Our first Constitution of the Chinese people is developed and enriched on the basis of the Common Program. In the future, our tasks are still very heavy. Everyone knows: American imperialism has always been hostile to our construction and progress, trying every means to obstruct and sabotage our cause, and the claws of aggression are always ready to reach our territory. The great struggle of resisting America and aiding Korea has severely struck the arrogant ambitions of American imperialism and ensured the safety of our country to carry out construction. However, the aggressive policy that American imperialism has always pursued will not change. As early as the invasion of Korea, it armed and occupied our territory of Taiwan, putting the people of Taiwan in a situation of deep suffering. Recently, it has even attempted to obstruct our just actions to liberate Taiwan, further invade our territory, incite war, and sabotage the peace of Asia and the world, and sabotage our just cause of building a happy life and our harmonious and loving big family by signing a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This treaty is a pure treaty of aggression, "completely illegal and invalid." We, every Chinese people, will absolutely not tolerate it and resolutely oppose it. Our Tibetan people, like the people of all ethnic groups in the country, as stated in the statement of Foreign Minister Zhou, "The Chinese people resolutely oppose war, but will not be intimidated by the threat of war. If someone insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people will definitely give a resolute counterattack to the interferers and provocateurs." To defend the sacred inviolability of our motherland's territory, to resolutely liberate Taiwan, and to save the compatriots in Taiwan who are living in extreme pain and darkness, the people of all ethnic groups in the country will be more closely united and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions. At the same time, I suggest that our Political Consultative Conference should, on the basis of the great achievements already made, continue to unite various ethnic groups, democratic classes, and democratic parties unremittingly, and strive for the construction of a perfect socialist society, for the realization of the integrity of our territory, and for the maintenance of the peace of Asia and the world.

Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country!

Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

Comrade Shen Yanqing's speech:

Chairman, Comrades:

I have listened to Comrade Chen Chutong's report on the work of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Comrade Zhang Boqian's explanation of the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report, and I am very excited.

Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report has given me great enlightenment and raised my awareness. Defending peace and opposing war is a long-term and complex struggle. We are confident that the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism are growing stronger every day, and the imperialist aggressor group will eventually fail, but today, they still have the strength to struggle and are continuing to create tensions and prepare for war; therefore, we should not be blindly optimistic, nor should we be passively terrified. We must accelerate our economic construction and national defense construction, strengthen our own forces; we must heighten our vigilance and smash any sabotage activities of domestic and foreign enemies.

Comrade Chen Chutong mentioned in his work report that the future tasks of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will be "to, on the basis of further strengthening the leadership of the working class and consolidating the alliance between workers and peasants, through the joint efforts of the various units participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, unite all forces that can be united, and strive to build our country into a great socialist country, to smash all enemies, both internal and external, who attempt to sabotage our country, and to defend world peace and promote the progress of human civilization." In the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, seven principles that the various units and individuals participating in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should jointly abide by are also stipulated. I think these are all completely correct and necessary.

Here, I would like to talk about one of the seven principles, that is, learning the theory of Marxism-Leninism, learning the policies of the state, improving political level, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and striving for ideological transformation.

The First National Committee of the Political Consultative Conference has led the learning, which has achieved results. Through learning, our ideological level and political level have been improved. I hope that in the future, under the leadership of the National Committee, our learning can be carried out more frequently and systematically, and criticism and self-criticism can be strengthened and discussions can be carried out. Our learning is not just reading books, but rather using Marxism-Leninism as a weapon of thought to cleanse the non-working-class ideological consciousness in our minds, and to temper and test ourselves in the actual struggle against feudal and bourgeois ideologies. Precisely because of this, if we are not vigilant against the remaining poison of landlord and bourgeois ideologies in society today, and coexist peacefully, we will lose the meaning of learning Marxism-Leninism. For a long time, we have not recognized the reactionary academic thoughts of Hu Shi, not only coexisting peacefully with them, but even taking a shameful attitude of surrender. This shows our lack of fighting spirit. We must face such realities: although the feudal landlord class has been eliminated, the poison of feudal ideology has not been eradicated and is still harming a part of the backward masses in society; the ideology and lifestyle of the bourgeoisie, because of the existence of the bourgeoisie in our country today, are even more unignorable, and in fact, many young people have been poisoned and corrupted. The cultural and educational undertakings of our country have achieved a lot in recent years, and the socialist position in the ideological front has been gradually expanding, which is a fact; but we must also admit another fact, that is, in many large and small cities in the country, there are still many "strongholds" spreading feudal and bourgeois ideologies.

Look at the following simple figures: through those bookstores and stalls renting out yellow books, about 1.5 to 2 million readers (children, adolescents, and adults) are poisoned every day in the country. The content of these yellow books is nothing more than three types: one, obscene and decadent; two, supernatural and martial arts; three, the "American way of life" that advocates lust and theft, plots to harm and kill. We should not underestimate the harmful magic power of these poisonous books. Today, such things have already happened in society: children who read martial arts books want to go to the mountains to seek sword immortals; some young workers and students are made dizzy and short-sighted by those obscene books, leading to decadent lives; young people influenced by those "American way of life" books have even organized gangster groups, bullied women, stolen public property, and even set fires and killed people.

Comrades, it is our duty to resolutely fight against feudal and bourgeois ideologies. Feudal and bourgeois ideologies spread their poison through various aspects of social life. The above-mentioned yellow books are just one aspect, but it is not an aspect that can be ignored. In this matter of ideological education related to up to 200,000 people every day, it is necessary to take measures. This requires the coordination of various forces to carry out planned, prepared, and step-by-step actions. The literary and artistic circles should strengthen learning, cleanse the non-working-class ideology within themselves, strengthen artistic practice, and use more and better works and performances to consolidate and expand the socialist ideological position, and eliminate the poisonous harm spread by those yellow books.

Finally, please allow me, on behalf of the literary and artistic circles and myself, to express my enthusiastic support for Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report; to completely agree with Comrade Chen Chutong's work report and the draft constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and to propose that the plenary session approve it.

    在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议上的发言
    陈崇桂委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我听了陈叔通副主席关于中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告，章伯钧委员关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明和周恩来副主席的政治报告，我完全同意和拥护。
    我是基督耶稣的信徒，传福音到今年恰恰五十年。一向被同道认为是属最保守、最顽固的宗派。我糊涂，也受过帝国主义的欺骗，以反苏、反共为纯正信仰之一信条。但是中国人民在共产党和毛主席的英明正确的领导之下，在反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的伟大的革命斗争中，取得了惊天动地的胜利，又在这伟大胜利的基础上取得了国防、政治、经济、文化、教育等各方面的成就。这些铁的事实开了我的眼睛，启发了我的思想，教育了我，又通过一系列学习，使我这老朽也不能不热爱祖国，不能不痛恨美帝国主义，因而我从心底深处感激毛主席和共产党，并且对苏联发生深厚的感情。同时，我享用宗教信仰自由的权利，我的宗教信仰没有摇动，并且比从前更纯洁。我还是信靠神、信耶稣复活，还是希望永生。我每日读经祈祷，维持我与父神的交通，我还是热心讲耶稣和他的十字架。我体会到爱祖国和爱教会是能够两全其美的，友好苏联和争取世界持久和平是符合我主耶稣的教训的。我现在就是以这种立场来发言。
    在爱祖国和反对帝国主义的基础上，为团结全国基督徒，在一九五○年九月二十三日，全国一千五百二十七位基督教会负责人和信徒，由吴耀宗先生领导，发表了“中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径”的宣言，指出中国基督教反帝爱国爱教的一条光明大道，号召全国教会和信徒个人割断同帝国主义的关系，肃清帝国主义的影响，彻底实行中国教会的自治、自养、自传。四年来，在这个文件上签名的基督徒共达四十一万七千三百八十九人，约占全国基督徒的三分之二。我们还在继续努力，要团结和争取全国基督徒，都来参加我们的运动。因为基督教的团结是全国人民大团结的一个环节，虽然是一个微小的环节，但教会不团结就对人民的大团结有不利的影响。任何信徒，用任何借口，闹分裂，不肯团结，都是美帝国主义者所欢喜的，因而也是人民所不赞成的。我们希望，我们相信，在不久的将来全国每一个信徒都要学习，受到爱国主义的教育，一定能够在爱国反帝的旗帜下同我们团结起来的。像我这老顽固，尚且能改变过来，何况别人呢？今年七月，中国基督教第一次全国会议在首都举行，正式成立了中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会。就我们基督教会本身说，四年多来，主要的成就是我们中国教会在人事、行政和经济等等方面，已经基本上割断了同帝国主义的关系，开始肃清帝国主义的影响，初步地实现了自治、自养、自传。一百多年来的中国基督教，是外国差会所控制着的，是被帝国主义利用来进行侵略的工具，通过教会、学校、医院在中国信徒中培养亲美、崇美、恐美、反苏、反共和卑视祖国的思想，以致使中国基督教会脱离群众，不辨别是非，不分清敌友，甚至认敌为友，认贼为父，在思想上做了帝国主义的俘虏。祖国解放了，基督教会也跟随着得到了解放。三自爱国运动改变了基督教的面貌，使基督教会逐步成为中国信徒自己主持的宗教团体。同时在思想上也批判了帝国主义的思想毒素。现在可以说我国绝大多数的基督徒是热爱祖国的，是痛恨美帝国主义的，是遵守宪法和法律的。我们十分宝贵宪法规定了的宗教信仰的自由。在政协全国委员会领导之下，我们进行了一系列的学习，经常彼此鼓励，决不滥用这个宝贵权利去作任何违反人民利益的活动，我们认识了祖国的伟大可爱，我们看见了祖国光明的美好的前途，我们要同全国人民在一起，为建设伟大的社会主义社会而努力奋斗。现在我们也觉悟了，认识了美帝国主义的丑恶面貌，知道那些战争贩子何等阴险、诡诈、毒辣。今年举行的基督教全国会议曾经通过一个决议，表示我们全国基督徒代表一致愤怒谴责美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾。台湾是我国神圣领土的一部分，我们一定要解放台湾。我们痛恨卖国贼蒋介石。他竟无耻地同美国签订了一个什么“共同防御条约”，这简直是蒋贼出卖祖国领土的契约。周恩来外长关于这条约的声明，彻底揭露了美国政府利用卖国贼蒋介石妄图长期武装占领我国领土台湾、扩大对我国的侵略、准备新的侵略战争的阴谋。这一声明再一次郑重地向全世界表明了全中国人民解放台湾、反对侵略、保卫和平的坚强意志。我们全中国基督徒表示坚决拥护。台湾的同胞在蒋匪的血腥统治下，在挣扎，在呼唤祖国。我们一定要把他们从水深火热中拯救出来。我们中国的基督徒当然要同全国人民在一起，为解放台湾而努力。我们要爱国守法，响应政府的号召，积极参加祖国的建设事业。根据主耶稣教训，我们坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略战争，反对美帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略，我们要努力争取世界持久的和平，我们认为要维护和争取世界和平，非解放台湾、收复我们的领土不可。
    王树常委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来副主席的政治报告、中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告和中国人民政治协商会议章程草案。
    我此次被邀参加中国人民政治协商会议，感到非常光荣。过去，我是东北军系统的一个军人。在旧中国时期，在那种黑暗、龌龊的反动政府中，我做了反动统治阶级的走卒。“九一八”事变，我们家乡东北被日本帝国主义强占了。我就抱着收复失地的希望和热情，投靠了反动的蒋介石政府。那时，我对蒋介石卖国集团怀着幻想，错误地认为他们能够团结全国人民，反抗日本的侵略，收复东北的失地。结果，我的愿望和事实完全相反。蒋介石卖国集团完全不顾人民的利益，完全不讲廉耻，他们竟整个地出卖了东北，并以所谓“不抵抗主义”容忍日本的侵略势力向中国的内地节节前进，以致不仅东北的人民完全国破家亡，而华北、华中、华东的广大人民也同样地陷入于国破家亡的悲惨境域。这时，我的幻想才完全破灭。非常明显，我们无论在什么时间和什么条件下，都不能跟着蒋介石走，跟着他走，处处都是死路。这是我积二十几年来的切身的体验。但是，我过去为蒋介石卖国集团效力的那一段历史，无论如何，对人民说来是有罪的，而伟大的共产党和毛主席却给我重新作人的机会。对此，在我个人来说，真是感愧交集，今后唯有尽我暮年的热力，追随全国人民，为巩固和扩大我国的人民民主统一战线，为完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对国内外敌人而斗争。
    新中国成立已经五年了。在这短短的时期中，我们祖国的面貌，全国人民的生活状况，都有了焕然一新的变革。这些变革是空前的，伟大的。它使全国人民由被奴役和贫困的地位，走上了当家做主，过着自由民主和幸福生活的地位。它使百余年来在国际间一直不得抬头的中国，重新树立了极高的国际威信。我们中华人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的兄弟般的友谊，在世界上成为反抗侵略、保卫和平的强大堡垒。这些体验，这几年来对我是非常深刻的。因此，我深深地相信，有着共产党和毛主席领导的中华人民共和国，一定能够由现在的社会逐步地过渡到幸福和繁荣的社会主义社会。有着苏联和中国以及所有和平民主社会主义阵营国家的兄弟合作，同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，便没有不可克服的困难和不能战胜的敌人。
    大家知道，现在横在我们和平建设的道路上有一个严重的侵略战争的威胁。美国侵略者正在千方百计、穷凶极恶地阴谋着侵略我国大陆。美蒋所谓“共同防御条约”已在十二月二日签订了，这是蒋介石卖国集团最后的一张卖身契约，是美国侵略者公然强占我国领土、明目张胆破坏国际法规侵犯我国主权的罪恶行为。任何一个有正义感的中国人，对此都是不能容忍的。我以一个东北人的地位，首先要记起蒋介石卖国集团出卖东北给全国人民所带来的沉痛教训。在那时，蒋介石出卖东北之后，日本的侵略者就以东北作为侵略整个中国的基地，结果继“沈阳事变”之后，不久又来了一个“芦沟桥事变”。今天，蒋介石出卖台湾给美国侵略者，势必演成美国侵略者以台湾为基地向中国大陆进行侵略。所以，蒋介石卖国集团是万恶的，是中国人民以及东方各国人民的死敌。美国侵略者更是中国人民和全世界人民的公敌。已经有了足够教训的中国人民，绝不能让历史的错误重演。所以，我们一定要彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，一定要斩断美国侵略者的侵略长矛。日本侵略者过去所走的老路是采取先侵占东北然后侵占整个中国的办法，结果是遭到了覆灭的失败。今天美国侵略者企图以台湾为基地，以蒋贼为工具，准备发动对整个中国的大规模进攻，同样也会遭到覆灭的失败。今天，我们中国已经是强大的中国了，我们既赢得抗美援朝的胜利，我们就一定能够解放台湾，彻底地消灭蒋介石卖国集团，斩断美国侵略者的魔手。我过去曾经恐惧过美国强盗，今天也许还有像我过去那样思想的人仍认为美帝可怕。现在我清楚了，美帝确是一只纸老虎。当初日本帝国主义者也是很可怕的，结果也一样是纸老虎。天下的帝国主义者都是一样，都是纸老虎。所以，只要反抗侵略，一定能够保卫和平。现在，也许还有人听信帝国主义分子的“中立台湾”、“托管台湾”等等欺骗宣传，认为这样就可以相安无事了。我们绝不能再受这种欺骗。当初日本帝国主义者侵占东北之后，也有一些帝国主义分子这样欺骗过我们，例如“国际联盟”就默认了日本侵略者一手制造的所谓“满洲国”的傀儡政权。今天的美国侵略势力，就是当初的日本法西斯；今天的蒋介石卖国贼，就是当日的溥仪。所以，所谓  “中立化”，所谓“托管”，就是把我国的领土出让给侵略者。台湾是我国的神圣领土，解放台湾是我国的内政问题，绝不容许他人来干涉。为了祖国的统一，为了保卫远东和世界的和平，我们一定要解放台湾，我愿尽一切力量为解放台湾而斗争到底。
    白海风委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来副主席的政治报告和陈叔通副主席所作的中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告及“中国人民政治协商会议章程”草案，并愿在实际工作中积极贯彻实行。
    我这次能来参加这次大会感觉特别荣誉和兴奋。我是代表少数民族蒙族出席的，因此，我愿将解放后几年来各少数民族地区发生的变化简要地报告几句。我们大家都知道解放前中国各少数民族是受着封建主义、帝国主义和国民党反动派的种种压迫和剥削，各民族都是过着极其惨痛的艰苦贫困黑暗的生活。不论那一个少数民族，到处都是受到歧视和侮辱的，因而有不少的人不敢公开承认自己是少数民族。而国民党反动统治阶级更不承认国内少数民族的存在。至于权利平等那就更谈不到了。自中华人民共和国成立起，由于中国共产党和毛泽东主席民族政策光辉的照耀和英明的措施，国内各少数民族地区就是最边远的地区也同样都改变成新的面貌了。各少数民族聚居地区都建立了不同等级的自治区政府，实现了自己“当家作主”的千百年迫切期待的愿望，发展了政治、经济、文化各项建设事业，并大大地改善了物质和文化生活，摆脱了过去贫困黑暗的岁月。如拿内蒙古和新疆等地区来看，更有突飞猛进的发展，现在已经建立了不少的轻重工业，正同国内先进的汉族地区一样，在国家过渡时期总路线灯塔照耀下，愉快地随着国家社会主义工业化和社会主义建设前进中。这就说明解放后的新中国和十月革命后的苏联一样没有种族歧视和压迫了。这种团结合作的民族关系，且由最近颁布的中华人民共和国宪法加以保障和巩固了。这就不难理解全国各族人民为什么对共产党和毛主席有着像父母和太阳一般的亲切的热爱。
    同时，我想借这机会表示我个人坚决拥护周恩来外长最近对美帝国主义同蒋介石卖国集团签订的“共同防御条约”的声明。这个由美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团进一步勾结、企图永久侵占我国领土台湾并继续扩大侵略祖国的战争的条约，不但阻碍中国人民解放自己神圣领土台湾，而且严重地威胁着祖国社会主义建设所需要的和平和安全，也同样威胁着亚洲和世界的和平和安全。这是准备发动新的世界侵略战争的条约。所以我们中国各族人民应当坚决拥护周外长的声明，集中一切力量，反对美蒋卑鄙无耻非法签订的任何条约，一定要解放台湾，拯救台湾人民的灾难，使台湾重回祖国怀抱。但是我们知道美帝国主义背弃国际公法，不顾自己参加签订的开罗宣言和波茨坦公告，不顾全世界亿万人民的正义呼声和斥责，不顾中国人民历次的反对和警告，更不接受它自己军事外交上的失败破产的教训，一意孤行，甘愿帮助被中国六亿人民唾弃的蒋介石卖国集团占据台湾，同强大的中国六亿人民为敌，正如我们周恩来外长声明的“如果美国政府不从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量，仍然坚持干涉中国内政，美国政府必须承担由此产生的一切严重后果。”站起来的新中国各族人民力量是无穷无尽的，我们坚决地反对战争，要求和平，但是我们绝不怕战争的威胁。我们一致响应中国人民政治协商会议的号召，为了祖国领土主权的完整和安全，为了维护亚洲和世界和平和安全，更加巩固地亲密地团结在共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，提高革命警惕，严防敌特挑拨阴谋和破坏活动，加强各项工作，积极发展生产，超额完成工农业增产计划，充实国防力量，为彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团和彻底粉碎任何帝国主义者阻碍解放台湾的侵略势力，为完成祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的伟大历史任务而努力奋斗。最后我感觉这次大会给了我很好的学习机会。我听了各项报告和各位委员的发言，受到很大启发教育。我今后更要加强学习，研究国家的各项政策和提高马列主义的理论水平，彻底改造我残存的旧思想意识和旧的人生观，争取更好地为人民服务。
    杜润生委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    过去一年来，在农村中，围绕着国家对农业的社会主义改造这一中心任务，进行了许多工作，这些工作给农民们带来了新的利益，因而获得广大农民的热情欢迎和大力支持。我现在只就最主要的几项工作来加以说明：
      一是互助合作运动的发展。目前全国已发展了大量的互助组和四十多万个农业生产合作社。各地曾对今年春季以前建立的十万个合作社的生产成绩做过一次检查。检查的结果说明：这些合作社虽然一般还是照旧依靠着原有的旧式农具去进行生产，但产量的增加却十分显著，百分之九十以上都增加了生产。一般增加百分之十五左右，最多有增到一倍以上的。互助合作组织不但本身增加了生产，同时还帮助了周围的单干农民也增加了生产。今年有些重要粮食产区遭受了严重的水灾，那里的生产曾蒙受了相当大的损失，可是全国粮食总产量还是超过了去年。所以能做到这一点，主要原因之一就是因为群众能依靠互助合作组织克服了种种困难。发展生产，改善生活，本是农民世世代代的愿望，现在的客观的事实告诉了农民，实现这一愿望的最可靠的办法，只有参加互助合作，靠剥削发财的富农式道路是走不通的。目前尽管还有部分农民仍然留恋着个体经营方式，对互助合作还有某些顾虑或不甚了解，但我们相信，只要注意正确地引导他们，采取耐心说服、实例示范的方法和循序而进的步骤发展，互助合作运动的规模必将会越来越大，参加的群众必将越来越多。周总理在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中提出：“我们希望，在第一个五年计划期末，全国可以有半数以上的农户和土地加入农业生产合作社”。这个号召已经得到农民群众的广泛响应。这个要求是可以完成并可能超额完成的。
    二是战胜水灾。今年夏秋之际，江淮洪水来势凶猛，我们的敌人抱着幸灾乐祸的态度，认定这次水灾将会成为对我国经济建设和人民生活的最严重打击，可是实际情况却不是按照他们的愿望发展的。由于过去几年进行了一系列的水利建设；由于当地大部群众业已在生产上组织起来；由于受灾区的党和人民政府领导得法而有力；又由于举国一致对灾区进行了支援和帮助，由于以上这些，就在防洪抢险、安全转移、排渍复堤、重建家园、恢复生产等工作方面做出切实的成绩，并在群众的坚定顽强、互助团结精神底下，创造出许多可歌可泣的事迹。结果是：大洪水的袭击被人民战胜了，洪水的破坏范围大大被缩小了，广大地区群众的生命财产的大部分得到抢救了，群众战胜天灾的意志和力量得到了锻炼，斗争经验更其丰富了，党和政府同农民之间的联系更加紧密起来了。弥补灾区损失的工作又在既得胜利的基础上开始了。
    三是统购统销政策的贯彻。国家实行了统购统销政策之后，对整个农民说来，所得到的好处是：废除了私商、富农的中间剥削，保证了物价的稳定，使农民买到较便宜的工业品，增加了实际收入。对农民中的贫农来说，还有特殊的好处，那就是根本改变了过去在秋天不得不贱卖、到春天又不得不贵买的困难处境。农民们在过去经过土地改革得到土地，免出地租，增加了一大笔收入；今天实行统购统销，废除了中间剥削，又得到一大笔收入；这两笔收入用于建设土地，增加生产，提高收成，还会得到更大的一笔收入。最近时期农民购买力增长，正是反映着整个经济制度有利于农民的变化。统购统销对农民的好处，还可以从今年水灾区群众的反映当中看得更明白些。在旧时代，那里遭受水灾，那里的粮价就猛涨，富有者乘灾荒进行剥削吞并，贫困者因灾荒而负债破产，这种情形在历史上不知重复过多少次。此次遭受水灾后，粮价一文未涨，粮食供应完全得到保证，贫富两极分化情形并未见发生。农民都说：这真是没有看见过的世界。很明白，农民群众从政府的措施当中得到了切实的利益，政府的措施也自然会得到他们的积极拥护和支持的。
    但是为什么在部分农民中对统购统销工作还有一些意见呢？在我们的实际工作当中还存在着一些缺点，当然是一个原因。购、销制度缺乏严密的调查统计工作基础，全国购销数虽大体切合实际，但当分配到下边时，区与区不平衡、户与户不平衡的情形总难免发生，尤其在估计具体的农户销售数字时难以十分准确，容易产生脱离了实际的情形。诸如此类的缺点，发生在一个新制度开始创立和形成的时期，发生在人多地广经济分散的农村当中，当然是可以理解的，部分农民有意见也是合乎情理的。但这仅仅是原因之一，且不是主要原因。此外还有一个更重要的原因，就是一部分富裕和较富裕的农民要求自由贸易的习惯势力对国家计划经济制度有所抵触。这种抵触情绪的大小，又同当地乡村资本主义势力影响深浅和社会主义措施成绩大小以及我们政治工作进行得好坏有密切联系。经验证明：当我们紧紧依靠了贫农，巩固地团结了中农，正确贯彻了限制富农的政策，加强了对群众的思想工作，努力办好各种社会主义的经济措施，从而树立起社会主义在乡村中的政治经济优势时，部分农民对统购统销政策的抵触情绪就会日益减少以至完全消除的，否则就难以消除或消除很慢。这说明统购统销政策从根本上讲是对农民有利无害的，部分农民对统购统销政策有某些抵触情绪，这并不表明他们的经济利益同这个社会主义的新措施有所抵触，而只是表明他们自身的习惯性自发趋势同这个措施有所抵触，这种抵触情绪是可以用适当的方法帮助他们消除的，如不帮助消除，是不利于党和政府对农民的团结，更其不利于农民进一步改善其生活的。认为统购统销措施同农民要求是两不相容的，从而想取消这一社会主义措施，再退到有害于农民的旧制度去，使农民再忍受往日已经受够了的各种痛苦，这当然是极端错误的。
    四是实行了普选，建立了人民代表大会制度。乡村中经过普选，实行了自我批评和批评，进一步吸收劳动人民广泛参加了政权管理工作，提高和提拔了大批群众积极分子，处理了一些坏人，兴办了许多好事，改正了一些坏事，从各方面巩固了人民民主专政。加上宪法公布，把我们国家过渡到社会主义社会的总任务和劳动人民享有的各种权利，用法律固定下来，这一切都引起农民的巨大兴奋。
    一年来在农村中进行的工作，当然不只上述几项。农民的各种物质文化福利逐步获得满足，是同国家的整个经济建设、文化建设的逐步进展息息相关和不能分离的。因此，随着整个国家经济的发展，也发展了文化教育事业，而使农民的子弟能够入学，过去农民们作为一个文盲所受的痛苦，他们的子弟可不再受了，只此一事就引起他们很大高兴。当然，劳动农民对于党和人民政府的要求和希望是不会停止在现在的水平的，他们正在提出进一步的要求和希望。他们希望着社会主义事业有更全面的发展，迅速发展工业，更多得到工业品的供应，因为今天工业品供应显然是赶不上日益增长的农村需求的。他们希望已经办起来的各项工作能办得更好一点，因为我们工作中的缺点还是很多的。农民当前所最关怀的几项工作，如畅通城乡物品交流，巩固发展生产合作社经济，进一步使统购统销工作合理化、制度化，需要我们首先加以注意，与此同时，各种工作的缺点也必须坚决加以改进。
    当农民群众感觉到党和人民政府如此深切地关怀着他们切身利益时，他们也就会同时提高自己对全民公共利益的关怀。千万次的斗争经验教育了农民，他们已经懂得或将进一步懂得以下这一条真理：没有全体的利益就没有个人的利益。为了自己的物质的、文化的、政治的利益，农民们一定要努力执行国家建设计划，一定要努力发展农业支援工业建设，一定要全心全力支援人民解放军解放台湾的神圣事业。祖国需要什么，就贡献什么，要兵有兵，要粮有粮，要力出力。
    我们的敌人正在使用千方百计来挑拨工农之间的关系。久经革命锻炼的中国农民和全国人民一样，都懂得这些敌人的用意所在。因此，他们必将更真诚地接受工人阶级和共产党的领导，接受人民政府的领导，更加努力巩固同工人阶级的团结合作，使敌人陷于完全的彻底的失败。
    巩固的工农联盟是人民民主统一战线的基础，全国农民们一定会毫不懈怠地巩固全体人民的革命大团结，一定会毫不留情地同破坏我们事业的国内外敌人进行坚决的斗争，保证我国伟大的社会主义建设事业走向最终胜利。
    方鼎英委员的发言
    我听了陈叔通副主席的工作报告、章伯钧委员对本会章程草案的说明和周恩来副主席的报告，感到非常兴奋，我同意并拥护这些报告和说明。几年来，我们的国家在政治、经济、文化各方面都有了飞跃的进步和惊人的成就，这就有力地说明了人民民主主义制度的优越性，也说明了全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，发挥了史无前例的创造性和积极性。
    现在全国人民的任务，就是要把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家，我们的一切工作，都是围绕着这一远大目标来进行的。可是美帝国主义者和逃窜到台湾的蒋介石卖国集团，最害怕我们的社会主义建设成功，时时刻刻在用卑鄙无耻的手段来破坏我们，企图在中国复辟，近来更变本加厉，不顾世界人民的公正舆论和我们的坚决反对，竟敢签订所谓美蒋“共同防御条约”，企图煽动新的战争。这是我们所绝对不能容忍的。台湾是我国不可分割的领土，台湾一天不解放，我国的领土就一天不完整，我国的和平建设环境就一天得不到安宁，远东和世界的和平就一天得不到保障。中国人民一定要解放台湾，不达目的决不罢休。因此，我对周外长十二月八日的声明，是竭诚拥护的，并愿竭尽我自己可能尽到的一点力量，同全国人民一道，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，为解放台湾、彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团而奋斗。
    陈叔通委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会的工作报告和中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明，并拥护周恩来副主席的政治报告。五年多来，中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，取得了空前的伟大的成就，这种成就是同中国人民民主统一战线的巩固和发展分不开的。今年九月第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议制定的中华人民共和国宪法说明：“今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线将继续发挥它的作用。”这次中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议充分地说明我们人民民主统一战线的广泛和扩大。就我们工商界参加会议的代表来说，也具有工商界各方面的代表性，体现出刘少奇委员长在宪法草案报告中所指出的：“由于我国这样的特殊历史条件，工人阶级和民族资产阶级之间就不但有斗争，还曾经有过并且现在还存在着联盟的关系。”工人阶级之所以和民族资产阶级还存在着联盟关系，是由于过渡时期民族资产阶级在国民经济中还有重要的作用，在扩大生产、改进企业管理和生产技术、培养和训练工人和技术人员等方面，在接受社会主义改造方面，对国家还可以作出一定的贡献。因此，在过渡时期，民族资产阶级在政治上也有一定的地位。
    人民给了我们这样光荣的地位，同时给了我们这样光荣的任务，我们就应该在社会主义建设事业中贡献出自己的力量。首先我们必须主动地接受社会主义改造，认真地把企业的改造和个人的改造结合起来。应该认识到工人阶级和民族资产阶级联盟的目的不是为着保存剥削制度，而是通过和平的道路，采取国家资本主义的各种不同形式，逐步以全民所有制代替资本家所有制，消灭剥削制度。经过几年来现实的教训，并随着过渡时期总任务和国家宪法的广泛深入的宣传和教育，许多工商业者提高了觉悟，表示愿意接受社会主义改造，也说明我们工商业者能够团结在工人阶级领导下发挥积极的有益的作用。但在社会主义改造过程中，斗争是一定会有的，现在有，将来还会有。凡是危害公共利益、扰乱社会经济秩序、破坏国家经济计划的一切非法行为，都是破坏国家的法律，也就是破坏我们的团结，必须与之作严肃的斗争。我们过去对于这方面的教育工作，是不够的，今后当加强工作。
    各位委员，一九五五年是我国进入第一个五年计划的第三年，将是国家在社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业上继续获得重大进展的一年。因此，我们工商业的社会主义改造的任务也更重大了。协助国家机关，运用我们的组织力量，加强爱国守法教育，鼓励和争取尽可能多的工商企业转变为各种不同形式的国家资本主义经济，并根据客观的发展，把工业企业引向国家资本主义的高级形式，推动商业进行逐行逐业的改造，是今后工商业联合会的主要工作。过去我们在这方面的努力是不够的，尤其是对企业的改造和对人的改造的结合注意得不够。自然，改造过程中不是没有困难的，但是要了解这些困难是前进中不可避免的困难。为保证社会主义改造的胜利实现，我们必须在国家机关的领导下，配合各方面的力量，尽力进行我们的工作。
    我们国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业愈胜利前进，敌人对我们的敌视和破坏也就愈疯狂。为了严防内外敌人对社会主义建设的破坏，以保卫我们人民革命的伟大成果，我们工商业者必须保持高度的警惕性，坚持对内外敌人的斗争。我们工商业者必须记住真诚地接受社会主义改造，积极经营，克服困难，虽然是敌人所不高兴的事情，但正是我们对人民应该做的好事情。毛主席早在一九四九年政治协商会议筹备会上就告诫我们：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。”五年来，完全证明了毛主席这一科学预见的正确性，美帝国主义自朝鲜停战和印度支那恢复和平以后，仍不接受失败的教训，最近竟明目张胆地与蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”，企图以台湾为基地，扩大对中国的侵略和准备新的战争，又一次证明敌人是极力要破坏我们的社会主义建设的。我们向大会保证：要号召全国工商业者用实际行动来支持周恩来外长关于美蒋条约的严正声明；我们要号召全国工商业者踊跃认购一九五五年国家经济建设公债，以加速国家的社会主义的建设，给内外敌人以坚决的回击。我们一定要解放台湾。
    我们要解放台湾，为的是保障和平，为的是在和平基础上完成社会主义建设。作为人民民主统一战线组成部分的全国工商界必须坚定地在中国共产党和工人阶级领导下，遵守政治协商会议的准则，加强和巩固人民民主统一战线，同全国人民一道，共同为消灭剥削和贫困，建成繁荣幸福的社会主义社会而努力。
    马叙伦委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我代表中国民主促进会发言。
    我完全同意并且拥护周恩来副主席的政治报告。我们中国民主促进会全体会员，保证在伟大的中国共产党的领导下，同全国人民一道，坚决为完成和贯彻周副主席所指示的当前任务而奋斗到底。
    美国侵略集团穷凶极恶，竟然同躲藏在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团缔结所谓“共同防御条约”。这个非法的侵略条约不但是对中华人民共和国主权和领土的侵犯，不但是对中国内政的横暴干涉，而且还严重地威胁中国的安全和亚洲的和平。站起来了的中国人民决不能容忍美帝国主义这种威胁和挑衅。中国人民决不能面对着这样的威胁和挑衅而置之不理。
    这是日汪卖国条约的翻版。美帝国主义已决心同中国人民长期为敌。蒋介石卖国集团已甘心彻头彻尾地充当美帝国主义的汉奸傀儡。但是历史决不会重演。日本帝国主义二十多年前制造“满洲国”，十多年前制造汪记傀儡政权，结果终于被中国人民所粉碎。何况在今天，中国人民已经解放，中国人民的力量正在日益强大，难道能够容许“满洲国”的丑史重演？中国人民曾经粉碎了日本帝国主义的侵略，曾经把溥仪和汪精卫等汉奸傀儡跺在脚下；中国人民今天更有力量和信心，一定能够击溃正在走日本老路的美国侵略集团的阴谋，一定能够彻底粉碎蒋介石这个认贼作父的汉奸傀儡。中国人民不解放台湾是决不罢休的！
    中国人民断断不能容忍美蒋侵略条约这样的奇耻大辱。全国人民已经一致奋起，在伟大的中国共产党的领导下，誓为洗涤耻辱而奋斗到底。台湾一天不解放，我们的整个解放大业就没有完成；台湾一天不解放，我们正在胜利地进行的社会主义建设事业就会受到阻碍；台湾一天不解放，我们的安全和亚洲的和平就没有保障。
    我们也充分认识到解放台湾的斗争是艰巨的斗争。因此我们全国人民必须不怠不懈，戒矜戒躁，在中国共产党的领导下同心协力，团结一致，从各自岗位上集中一切力量投入这个艰巨的斗争，完成我们神圣的任务。我们有着把美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团赶出大陆的经验，我们有着轰轰烈烈的伟大抗美援朝运动的胜利经验，我们有着领导我们前进的正确的、伟大的中国共产党，有着不可战胜的钢铁般的中国人民解放军，有着团结一致的巩固的人民民主统一战线，更有着以伟大的苏联为首的兄弟国家无私的援助和全世界各国爱好和平的人民的支持，我们毫无疑问地能够取得最后的胜利。
    过去五年多来，我们全国人民在中国共产党的领导下团结得很好，今天在进行解放台湾和社会主义建设和社会主义改造的斗争中，我们一定更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围。我们必须严防敌人的造谣、挑拨和破坏。我们必须朝夕警惕，不容许敌人从任何方面钻一些空子。五年多来，我们各民主党派在划清敌我界限和进行思想改造方面都取得了很大的成绩，但我们决不应该因此自满。我们国家一日千里地进步。我们离开国家对我们所要求的水平还远。我们的责任艰巨，尤其是在社会主义改造时期中，阶级斗争是激烈的。我们既要杜绝已经被消灭的反动阶级死灰复燃的可能；我们更须严重警惕正在被消灭的阶级中的少数坚决抗拒分子对我们神圣的社会主义事业的破坏。我们每一个人必须进一步地严格要求自己，必须学习用批评和自我批评的方法来不断克服我们的缺点，提高我们的水平。只有这样，才能使全国人民的大团结更加巩固。
    感谢中国共产党的指引和领导，我们祖国在短短五年中已经根本改变了面貌。作为一个中国人，我活了七十年从未像今天这样地感到扬眉吐气。自然，我们在五年中，还只是走了一段路。无限广阔的幸福的未来正展开在我们的前面。这就需要我们大家加倍努力，团结一致，紧紧跟着中国共产党前进，才能达到最后的目的。
    各位委员：我以无限兴奋的心情展望我们每天在改变着面貌的伟大祖国的前途，因而也更加激起了我们对于美蒋非法缔结侵略条约的无比愤怒。我们一定要粉碎这个罪恶的侵略条约。我们的领土和主权决不容许侵犯，我们的内政决不容许干涉，我们神圣的社会主义事业决不容许威胁和破坏。我们一定要解放台湾。六万万人的坚强团结是不可战胜的力量。美帝国主义及其傀儡蒋介石汉奸竟敢对站起来了的六万万中国人民疯狂挑衅，那正如中国的古话所说：“蜉蝣撼大树，可笑不自量！”
    司徒美堂委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    周恩来副主席的政治报告和陈叔通副主席的关于中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会的工作报告和章伯钧委员关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明都很好，尤其是周恩来副主席的政治报告对我们的帮助更大，我完全赞成这些报告。
    我是华侨方面的委员，我想谈谈自己的一点感想和一些粗浅的意见。
    祖国解放后，国民经济迅速得到恢复，同时还胜利地完成了一系列的社会改革工作，抗美援朝运动获得了伟大胜利，经济建设有了辉煌成就，我国和平外交政策的外交活动与国际活动发生了巨大影响，我国国际地位迅速提高。祖国在毛主席领导下，在这样短短的几年内，就这样空前地团结统一富强兴盛起来，这确实使国外华侨感到无比的兴奋和自豪，也大大鼓舞了华侨的爱国热情，促进了国外华侨的大团结。
    国外华侨对蒋介石卖国集团是深恶痛绝的。在过去蒋介石反动统治时期，不仅国内人民遭受深重的迫害，国外华侨也同样遭受到蒋匪帮所造成的恶毒灾难。因此，祖国人民一展开进行解放台湾斗争的时候，便获得了海外华侨的热烈支持。最近美帝国主义同蒋介石卖国集团签订了一项所谓“共同防御条约”，这实际上是想使霸占台湾的罪恶行为“合法”化，想以台湾作为他们侵略中国和为祸远东的侵略战争的军事基地。只要是有头脑的人们都会看得很清楚，这个条约是美国侵略集团明目张胆地加紧侵略亚洲的战争条约。这个条约是蒋介石卖国集团卖国卖了二十七年的又一次最无耻的卖国条约，这个条约可以概括为四个字，那就是战争、卖国。为了祖国的安全和祖国领土的完整，我们一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。美国的一切武装力量必须撤出台湾和台湾海峡。国外的广大华侨是热烈支持祖国解放台湾的斗争的，爱国华侨也正为揭破和粉碎蒋介石卖国集团在华侨中的阴谋活动而奋斗，他们正在扩大团结、巩固团结与互助互济，并为促进同当地人民的友好关系而努力。
    其次我想谈谈关于侨务方面的问题。五年来，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，祖国政府各有关部门对侨务工作都做出了应有的成绩，如保护我们华侨的正当权利和利益，便利侨汇，安置归侨难侨，处理华侨学生升学，指导侨眷生产，清偿解放前存款，团结国外广大华侨在祖国周围等，在这些方面都做了积极的工作。凡此一切，广大华侨对我们中华人民共和国政府充满了感激的心情，更加坚强了他们的团结爱国的信念。
    但是，由于许多客观原因影响和主观努力不够，我个人认为华侨工作还是存在着若干问题急待解决的。这些问题如能迅速解决，不但对华侨有好处，而且对祖国的社会主义建设也有积极的意义。
    首先是正确地贯彻侨汇政策的问题。五年来祖国政府实行“便利侨汇，服务侨胞”的方针是正确的。在这一方针下，政府的有关部门在五年来制定了一系列的便利侨汇的具体政策，如规定了侨汇优待牌价和原币汇款、原币存单等办法，保证了侨眷不因币制的变动而遭受损失。这些措施是获得了国外广大华侨的拥护的。但是据我所知，某些地区个别区乡干部还有对侨汇政策认识不足的现象，希望有关部门今后注意。
    其次，是归国华侨联谊会，以往作了不少工作，也有不少成绩，但仍存在一些缺点，今后除“侨联”自己努力外，我希望有关部门能对“侨联”的工作加以重视与指导。
    我们的国家和人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，真是有着无限光明幸福的前途。人民民主统一战线过去能在中国革命过程中发挥它重大的作用，也正是因为有了中国共产党的领导。我想我们这些政协的委员，只要诚心诚意跟共产党走，诚心诚意为人民服务，就一定能团结得更好，就一定能动员更多的力量，为建设我们幸福的祖国而奋斗。我衷心祝贺会议的成功！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    罗隆基委员的发言主席、诸位委员：
    今天，我代表中国民主同盟拥护周恩来副主席的政治报告，同意陈叔通副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告，赞成章伯钧委员关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明。
    五年多来，中国人民政治协商会议在中国共产党和伟大的毛泽东主席领导下，对国家各项建设事业以及对国际上保卫世界和平的斗争做了许多工作，并且获得了光辉的成就。参加政协的各民主党派、各人民团体本身不仅都巩固了而且都加强了。这就为中国人民民主统一战线今天的扩大和发展奠定了好的基础。今天，我代表中国民主同盟向我们的领导党，中国共产党，向伟大的毛主席，表示深切的感谢！
    诸位委员，今天在中国人民面前，同时也在我们这次大会面前有两个重要的任务：第一，解放台湾，消灭蒋贼；第二，实现社会主义工业化和社会主义改造。中国民主同盟是八月二十二日发表的解放台湾联合宣言上签名的一个单位。在我们宣言发表以后，美国侵略集团竟公然同蒋贼签订所谓“共同防御条约”，这是向我们中国人民进一步的严重的战争挑衅。今天，我代表中国民主同盟再一次庄严地声明：我们一定同各民主党派、各人民团体更加坚强地团结起来，全力贯彻我们的联合宣言。我们今天要告诉美国的艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯：战争，吓不倒中国人民的！坚强团结了的六万万中国人民，有过长期革命战争锻炼的六万万中国人民。我们今天有力量，有决心，有信心粉碎美蒋“条约”，消灭蒋贼，解放台湾。
    关于社会主义改造，站在中国民主同盟的工作岗位上来说，就是加紧努力，推进中国中上层知识分子的思想改造。首先，我们对学术界目前正在轰轰烈烈进行的批判胡适思想、清算英美资产阶级思想这些工作表示热烈的欢迎和拥护。这是中国知识分子在思想改造中十分重要的工作。
    几年来，中国知识分子学习马克思主义的理论，可以肯定地说，是有了成绩的。马克思主义思想在中国已经广泛地传播了！中国知识分子，经过几年来的学习，一般地说来，都有了些进步。不过，我们必须承认，过去我们对批判和清算中国知识分子的英美资产阶级思想的工作还做得不够。因为这个缘故，我们有些人的学习，可能只是在英国的边沁和美国的杜威制造的实验主义牌的服装上披上了一件马克思主义的外衣。这种学习是解决不了思想改造的问题的。
    中国今天的知识分子，特别是中上层知识分子，通常所谓大知识分子或所谓高级知识分子，一般地说，都是从旧社会里长成的，大概都曾经直接或间接受过英美资产阶级思想的影响。我自己就是这样一个人。旧的大知识分子，大之所以成其为大，就是他有大量的旧思想；旧的高级知识分子，高之所以成其为高，就是他有高度的旧思想。中国有句话：“先入为主”。这个又高又大的旧思想堡垒建筑在一个人的头脑里，就成了他接受新事物的大障碍了。这些高而且大的旧思想堡垒留在社会上，就必定阻挠我们的社会主义改造。我们的思想改造，首先就必须冲破这个堡垒，拆毁这个堡垒，扫清这个堡垒。大家一定还记得，从前唐朝的韩愈就说过这样两句话：“不塞不流，不止不行。”我借用他这两句话来说明我们今天的思想斗争。我们必须清算知识分子中的英美资产阶级思想，才能巩固马克思主义的理论在中国社会主义改造中的阵地。
    胡适是英美资产阶级思想的典型代表。胡适本人今天逃亡在美国，但胡适代表的思想，毫无疑义，今天还隐藏在中国的不少知识分子的头脑中。胡适思想在中国的防空洞、避难所，绝对不止俞平伯先生一个人的头脑。大家一定还记得，过去曾经流行过一句话：“我的朋友胡适”。“我的朋友胡适”这是多么亲切的一句话哟！现在当然没有人说这句话了。但政治上划清了界限并不等于思想上划清了界限。只要思想上没有划清敌我界限，只要英美资产阶级思想还在大脑皮质上作祟，这个人就还在和胡适做好朋友。要同胡适真正绝交，就必须同英美资产阶级思想断绝关系，完完全全地断绝关系，干干净净地断绝关系！
    现在许多学校里正在提倡科学研究，就是说，用科学的方法研究实际问题。这种学风上的转变，我们赞成，我们欢迎。不过，批判胡适思想和科学研究两件事要结合起来做，这对于知识分子的思想改造是大有帮助的。我们必须先批判胡适思想，然后科学研究才不会走上唯心论钻牛角尖的错误道路。我们才不会三十年研究红楼梦，做了一个整整三十年的梦。学习马克思主义的理论和科学研究结合起来，这就是理论和实际的统一。这样，我们的学习就不会是静止地孤立地学习马克思主义，我们的研究就是运用马克思主义立场、观点和方法的研究。这样，我们的科学研究，对中国的经济、文化建设事业就必定有很大的贡献！
    最后，我站在这个人民政协的讲台号召中国的知识分子，都来参加批判胡适思想、清算英美资产阶级思想的工作，都来做好科学研究工作。中国知识分子大家努力把这两件事做好了，我们的思想改造就走上了胜利的道路了！
    李烛尘委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我非常兴奋地体会到五年多来中国人民民主统一战线的组织——中国人民政治协商会议，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下，在人民事业中进行了自己的工作，获得了辉煌的成就，而最伟大最光荣的是动员和团结全国人民进行了保卫祖国安全、保卫世界和平的抗美援朝的斗争，从而激发了全国人民爱国主义、国际主义的精神，推动了国家的建设事业、各种社会改革运动和思想改造工作，为把中国建设和改造成为一个伟大的社会主义国家准备了必要的条件。
    我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的胜利前进，是美帝国主义所不喜欢的，他们更不甘心于在战场上和外交坛席上遭遇到的可耻的失败，企图以战争威胁来阻挠中国人民解放台湾，最近更卑鄙地同逃窜在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”。中国人民懂得，只有反对侵略，才能保卫和平，因此，我们决不会被战争的威胁吓倒，决不容忍这一侵犯领土主权的行为，一定要把台湾从蒋介石卖国集团的暴政下解放出来。
    中国人民自己有足够的力量取得反抗美帝国主义侵略行为的胜利。同时，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营国家的力量日益强大，已结成了一个保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒；爱好和平的全世界各国人民，包括美国的广大群众在内，展开了和平民主运动，发挥出制止侵略战争的巨大力量，对一小撮帝国主义国家的法西斯反动势力进行斗争。我曾到过维也纳、斯德哥尔摩参加了世界和平民主运动的会议，尤其是在维也纳“世界人民和平大会”的会议上有八十五个国家参加，没有一个代表不控诉美帝国主义奴役各国人民的罪行，更有若干代表在会场上垂涕而道。这是正在那里燃烧着的强烈的一团人民的愤怒火焰，我亲眼看到这些情况，因而体会到像这样强大而团结的力量，是不可战胜的。帝国主义好战分子如果敢于发动战争，他们必然在这样强大的力量面前被粉碎。美帝国主义侵略者不是夸耀它在世界上有数以千百计的军事基地吗？他们迟早总会明白，围绕着这些基地的爱好和平的人民，将是奋起毁灭这些基地的力量。我们反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争是处在有利的形势下，可是同时我们也不应当忽视这一斗争的艰巨性和长期性。在艰巨而长期的斗争过程中，不能没有困难，但我们能够克服，而美帝国主义内部困难重重，根据社会发展规律，他们是无法解决自己的困难的。我们要看清楚胜利的形势，怀着必胜的信心，我们更要万众一心地加倍努力，争取我们的胜利的实现。
    五年多来，中国民族资产阶级在人民民主统一战线中，参加反对美帝国主义侵略的爱国运动，曾在全国若干城市举行了抗美援朝保家卫国的示威大游行，并在捐献飞机大炮的运动中贡献了一定的力量。在目前国际局势下，更需要我们进一步发扬爱国主义的精神，同全国人民一道加紧团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，尽自己的力量，以实际行动来参加反对美帝国主义勾结蒋介石卖国集团侵犯我国领土主权的斗争，支援解放我国的领土台湾，完成祖国的完全统一，更发扬我们工商业者爱国主义的精神。因此，我们要适应国家过渡时期总任务的要求，站在自己的岗位上发挥对于国计民生积极的有益的作用。我们首先要做到真正爱国守法，服从国家行政机关的管理，国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，并接受国家对资本主义工商业所采取的利用、限制和改造的政策。在爱国守法的基础上，我们需要努力改造企业的生产、经营、管理，积极创造条件，主动克服困难，把企业推上国家资本主义的轨道，接受社会主义改造，发挥潜在力量，为国家生产更多的财富。对于我们更重要的，还要结合企业改造，提高自己的认识，认真地进行个人的思想改造。但思想改造，不是“一旦豁然贯通”的事情，而是要在企业走上国家资本主义的轨道后，在新人物和新事物面前，在自己的学习和实践中，加以深刻的体会和对比。例如，在走上国家资本主义轨道，特别在企业公私合营以后，为什么在生产上会有那么大的变化？这当然是由于生产关系的改变，提高了劳动生产率，而一切经营管理，由于社会主义成分在企业内部居于领导的地位，就更能够得到必要的改进。不过，在合营企业中，公私两方面都有应该注意改进的地方，在资本家和资本家代理人方面，大部分存有一种自卑感，以为资本家所有制迟早要废除（事实是要消灭剥削制度而不是消灭资本家个人），因此，就缩手缩脚地观望不前，这是不对的，应当服从领导，守职尽责，尽量贡献出自己的技术和能力，同时认真学习，决心改造，开辟自己光明的前途。在政府干部方面，有些人存有一种优越感，对于教育、改造资方人员注意不够，做得不够，这也是应该改进的。希望政府干部本与人为善的精神，加强对于资方人员的领导和教育工作，使他们感奋起来，力求上进，这是立竿见影的事情。同时，民建会和工商联也要针对私营工商业者的情况，不断地予以帮助和鼓励，对于以为企业进行了改造，个人可以放松努力，甚至消极依赖的思想，应予以解释和批判，对于有抗拒改造的思想或行为的人，则需要进行严肃的教育和处理。能如此，私营工商业的社会主义改造，我相信会产生积极有益的效果。
    各位委员！全国人民正在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下，为反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫祖国安全、保卫国际和平而斗争，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而斗争。作为一个中国人民民主统一战线组成部分的中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会，需要教育和帮助自己的成员接受企业和个人的双重改造，并密切联系工商界群众，更多地贡献自己的力量，以实际行动来支援解放台湾，为捍卫祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的事业而努力！
    许德珩委员的发言主席团、主席、各位委员：
    我参加这次会议，听了周恩来副主席的政治报告，以及中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会的工作报告和关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明，我代表九三学社表示热烈的拥护和同意。
    中国人民政治协商会议成立到现在，已经五年多了。五年多来，全国人民在各个战线上都取得了空前未有的辉煌胜利，现在正信心百倍地向着社会主义的前途迈进。中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会在这个期间也从各方面进行了巨大的工作，发挥了它的重要作用，光荣地完成了自己的历史任务。以中国共产党为领导的人民民主统一战线是空前地巩固了和扩大了，现在在这个基础上举行中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议，是全国人民团结进一步加强和扩大的重要标志。
    各位委员！摆在我们面前一个最迫切的任务，就是解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。大家都知道，美国侵略者同蒋介石卖国贼最近签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图长期地霸占我国领土台湾，并进一步地利用台湾作为军事基地来进行侵略，发动新的侵略战争。在这个“条约”签订以后，美国侵略者又无耻地对我国政府判决十三名美国间谍这一个正义的措施大肆叫嚣，企图掩盖罪恶的美蒋条约，迷惑世界人民，并用无赖手段来压迫现在还在美国的中国学生。美国侵略者公然支持早已被中国人民所唾弃的卖国贼蒋介石，破坏我国主权和领土完整，干涉我国的内政，危害亚洲和世界和平的侵略行为，是我国六万万人民所绝对不能容忍的。我们一定要解放台湾，收复被美国侵占的一切领土，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，不达目的，决不罢休。美国侵略者的任何战争威胁都吓不倒中国人民，反之，只有增加中国人民愈来愈深的仇恨。我们全体社员坚决地同全国人民一道，从各方面加强工作，为解放台湾而贡献一切力量。
    各位委员，中国人民政治协商会议章程草案所规定的七项“准则”，是我们要共同遵守的原则，我们一定要以全力来促其实现。九三学社社员大部分都是文教科学工作者。“准则”第七项规定：“学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习国家的政策，提高政治水平，展开批评和自我批评，努力进行思想改造”，这对于我们有更重大的意义。应该指出，我国人民民主统一战线的巩固和发展，是以统一战线的全体成员思想水平的不断提高为其重要条件。五年多来，我国知识分子经过各种政治运动和学习，思想水平有了显著的提高，这是应该肯定的，但是还没有普遍地深入到学术思想方面，在很多学术部门和很多学术工作者的头脑中，还是资产阶级唯心论占着统治地位。由“红楼梦”研究所反映出来的胡适资产阶级唯心论对于古典文学研究的毒害，只不过是一个突出的例子。“五四”以来，胡适一贯地就是帝国主义的代言人，封建军阀的策士，一直到最后堕落为蒋介石卖国集团中的战犯。许多文化学术界的同志们对于胡适的反动政治面貌早已认识清楚了，但对于胡适的反动学术思想却往往失去了警惕，有的人甚至在学术工作上做了这种思想的俘虏。领导党所号召的对于胡适资产阶级唯心论的批判，对于全国文化学术界是及时敲起了警钟。知识分子当前的严重任务就是在党的号召之下，在已有成就的基础上，把思想改造推进一步，深入到学术工作和学术思想的领域。九三学社从事学术研究工作的社员，其中也有人做了胡适资产阶级思想的俘虏，而我们竟长期没有觉察，这说明我们的工作和学习都做得不够。我们全体社员和所联系的文教科学工作者，现在就要更加积极地、热烈地投入这一伟大的思想斗争，从文学、哲学、历史、政治、经济、自然科学各部门进行深入的有系统的学习和讨论，认真地批判资产阶级唯心论思想，更好地来完成国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的光荣任务。
    敬祝大会的圆满成功！
    郭棣活委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我对于周恩来副主席的政治报告，陈叔通副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告和章伯钧委员关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明，是完全同意和衷心拥护。
    我很兴奋愉快地参加中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议。五年多来，中国人民政治协商会议在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，在各种社会改革运动中，在保卫祖国安全、保卫世界和平的抗美援朝斗争中，在动员人民参加政治、经济、文化各方面的建设工作中，在巩固和扩大统一战线的组织工作中，在进行思想改造工作中，都获得了辉煌的成就。现在，中华人民共和国宪法已经颁布了，共同纲领的基本内容已经列入宪法。宪法序言中说：“今后在动员和团结全国人民完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，我国的人民民主统一战线将继续发挥它的作用。”
    我们的国家是一个多民族的六万万人口的国家。经过各种爱国运动和思想教育，我国人民的觉悟认识都有提高，出现了中国历史上从来没有的全国人民大团结。我国的国际地位也起了大变化，特别是今年周总理到日内瓦参加重要会议，得到各国的重视，又访问了印度和缅甸，同印度总理和缅甸总理发表了“互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处”的五项原则的联合声明。以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的各个国家，数年来表现着国际主义的团结和友好，在世界和平民主运动方面也是有成就的。我们要更努力争取爱好和平的全世界各国人民，得到更大的胜利，更加强国际上亲密团结友谊。
    我们的国家，解放前长时期处在各种恶劣情况之下，农业工业都非常落后，人民大多数食不饱、穿不暖，在各种压迫下过着很贫穷艰难的生活。解放后几年来，工业农业生产量大大超过历史上最高纪录，文化教育、水利、交通运输及其他各项新建设有大量的发展，人民的生活，特别是广大工人和农民的生活是有提高。去年，政府提出了过渡时期总任务。放在我们面前的工作是很艰巨，是有困难的。全国人民必须更团结，更努力工作，贡献自己最大的力量，来建设我们中国成为一个工业化的具有高度文化程度的伟大的国家。
    中国民族资产阶级在人民民主统一战线中，参加各种爱国运动，对国家对人民是有一定的贡献。我们要发挥对于国计民生有利的作用，必须作到爱国守法、言行一致，服从国营经济领导，接受工人群众的监督，接受国家对资本主义工商业的利用、限制和改造，努力改善经营管理，增产节约，消灭浪费，提高质量，降低成本，为国家积累更多财富。我们要接受社会主义改造，企业改造结合个人改造，工商业者越来越多的人表示愿意接受社会主义改造。今年外国贵宾到中国访问的很多，罗马尼亚人民共和国国民议会主席团主席格罗查博士到上海访问时，也曾对我们亲密谈话，告诉我们关于罗马尼亚的革命斗争历史，关于思想改造和资本主义工商业者的社会主义改造等问题，给上海工商界很大的教育和鼓舞。格罗查博士以前是一位大资本家，创办经营许多大企业和大工厂，但他很愉快地接受了改造，现在参加罗马尼亚政府重要工作，为他的国家和人民服务。我们中国工商业者应该好好地学习格罗查博士的榜样，接受企业改造和个人改造，私营合营工业对加工任务，必须按时按质按量来完成。我认为单完成加工任务是不够的，应更积极努力积累更多的资金，服从国家计划，在内地开设新厂，出产更多更好的工业产品，来满足全国人民逐年增加的需要。
    台湾是我国的领土，我们工商界必须同全国人民一道，提高警惕，严防国内外的敌人破坏，贡献自己最大力量，支援解放台湾。
    各位委员，五年来我们国家的成就是伟大的，我们的前途是光明的，是更伟大的，让我们全国人民更团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，更努力工作，为社会主义建设和过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗！
    班禅额尔德尼委员的发言主席、各位委员、各位先生们：
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议的召开，在目前是完全需要的、适时的，我以能够参加这个会议而感到荣幸，今天我愿意代表西藏的僧俗人民预祝大会的胜利成功。
    自从中国人民摧毁了蒋介石的反动统治，取得了解放自己的伟大胜利以后，各个民族、各界人民、各个党派、各个团体为了共同治理我们的国家，恢复和发展我们的经济建设，保卫我们的胜利成果，不断地提高和改善全国各族人民的文化和物质生活而组成了政治协商会议，会议上选举了国家的领导机关，通过了为广大人民所一心拥护严格遵循的共同纲领。几年来，我们在共同纲领的指导下，全国各族人民都空前地、牢固地、亲密地团结起来了，我们藏族人民也才从此而结束了被压迫、受歧视的历史，同全国各民族一样，享受着平等的权利。
    我们祖国的蒸蒸日上、日益富强，是惊天动地的。我们在各方面所取得的成就是巨大的。中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议，完成了光荣的历史任务，我们中国人民的第一个宪法就是在共同纲领的基础上丰富和发展起来的，今后我们的任务仍是十分重大。谁都知道：美帝国主义一直是敌视我们的建设，敌视我们的进步，千方百计地妄想阻挠和破坏我们的事业，侵略的魔爪随时都想伸到我们的领土上。抗美援朝的伟大斗争严重地打击了美帝国主义的狂妄野心，保卫了我们国家得以安全地进行建设。但是美帝国主义所一贯奉行的好战政策是不会改变的，远在侵略朝鲜的同时，就武装侵占了我们的领土台湾，置台湾人民于水深火热之中，最近又企图阻挠我们解放台湾的正义行动，进一步侵犯我们的领土，煽动战争，破坏亚洲和世界的和平，破坏我们为了建设幸福生活的正义事业，破坏我们和睦友爱的大家庭而同蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”。这个条约是十足的侵略条约，“根本是非法的，无效的”，我们每一个中国人民都决不容忍，坚决反对，我们藏族人民也和全国各族人民一样，正如周外长的声明中所说的“中国人民坚决地反对战争，但是决不会被战争威胁吓倒。如果有人硬要把战争强加在中国人民头上，中国人民一定要对干涉者和挑衅者给以坚决的回击”。为了保卫我们祖国领土的神圣不可侵犯，为了坚决解放台湾，为了拯救生活在暗无天日极其痛苦中的台湾同胞，我们全国各族人民，将会更加紧密地团结起来，以实际行动来支持早日解放台湾的斗争。同时我建议我们的政治协商会议，应当在过去已经取得的巨大成就的基础上，继续不懈地团结各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派，为建设美满的社会主义社会，为了实现我们领土的完整，为了维护亚洲与世界的和平而努力奋斗。
    全国各族人民大团结万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    沈雁冰委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    听了陈叔通副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会工作报告，章伯钧委员的关于中国人民政治协商会议章程草案的说明，周恩来副主席的政治报告，我十分兴奋。
    周副主席的政治报告给予我很大的启发，提高了我的认识。保卫和平、反对战争是长期的复杂的斗争。我们确信，和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量一天天在壮大，帝国主义侵略集团最后必然失败，但在今天，他们还有力量挣扎，而且正在继续制造紧张局势，准备战争；因此，我们不应盲目乐观，也不应消极恐慌。我们要加紧我们的经济建设、国防建设，壮大自己的力量；我们要提高警惕，粉碎国内外敌人的任何阴谋破坏活动。
    陈叔通副主席在工作报告中说到今后中国人民政治协商会议的任务，将是“在继续加强工人阶级领导和巩固工农联盟的基础上，经过参加中国人民政治协商会议的各单位在中国共产党领导下的团结努力，去团结一切可以团结的力量，为建设我国成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而斗争，为粉碎一切企图破坏我们国家的内外敌人而斗争，为保卫世界和平和发展人类进步事业而斗争。”在中国人民政治协商会议章程草案中，又规定了参加中国人民政治协商会议的各单位和个人共同遵守的七项准则。我认为这都完全正确，完全必要。
    在这里，我愿意就七项准则之一，即关于学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习国家的政策，提高政治水平，展开批评和自我批评，努力进行思想改造这一方面，说一说我的不成熟的意见。
    政协第一届全国委员会领导学习，是有成就的。经过学习，我们的思想水平、政治水平得到了提高。我希望今后在全国委员会领导之下，我们的学习能更经常、更系统地进行，并加强批评和自我批评，展开讨论。我们的学习不是死读书，而是要用马克思列宁主义这思想武器来清除我们头脑中的非工人阶级的思想意识，而是要在反对封建思想、资产阶级思想的实际斗争中取得锻炼，考验自己。正因为这样，如果我们对于今天还存在于社会中的地主、资产阶级思想的流毒不加警惕，和平共处，便失掉了我们的学习马克思列宁主义的意义了。长时期来，我们对于胡适的学术上的反动思想没有认识，不但与之和平共处，甚至采取了可耻的投降态度。这说明了我们的缺乏战斗性。我们要正视这样的现实：封建地主阶级虽然已经消灭，但是封建思想的余毒还没有肃清，还在毒害社会上一部分落后的群众；资产阶级的思想和生活方式则因我国今天有资产阶级的存在，因而它的影响更不容漠视，事实上，今天已有不少青年受了毒害和腐蚀。我们国家的文化教育事业几年来有不少成就，在思想战线上我们的社会主义阵地逐渐在扩大，这是事实；但是我们也不能不承认另一事实，即在全国各大、小城市内，传播封建思想和资产阶级思想的
  “据点”也还不少。请看下列的简单的数字：通过那些出租黄色图书的铺、摊，全国每天大约有一百五十万到二百万的读者（儿童、少年和成年人）受着毒害。这些黄色图书，内容不外三类：一、淫秽颓废；二、神怪武侠；三、诲淫诲盗、谋财害命的“美国生活方式”。我们不能小看这些有毒的图书害人的魔力。今天社会上也已经发生了这样的事：看了武侠读物的儿童想到什么山上求剑仙；有些青年工人、学生被那些淫书弄得神昏志短、生活腐化；受了那些“美国生活方式”读物的影响的青年，有的竟然组织流氓集团，称霸里巷，侮辱妇女，盗窃公产，乃至杀人放火。
    各位委员，坚决地和封建思想、资产阶级思想作斗争，乃是我们的义不容辞的任务。封建思想和资产阶级思想通过社会生活的各个方面来传播它的毒害。上述黄色图书仅其一端，不过又是不容轻视的一端。在这一个关系到每天多至二百万人的思想教育问题的事件上，采取措施是十分必要的。这就需要配合各方面的力量来有计划、有准备、有步骤地进行。文学艺术界要加强学习，清除自身的非工人阶级思想，加强艺术实践，以更多更好的作品和演出来巩固并扩大社会主义思想阵地，消灭那些黄色图书流播着的毒害。
    最后，请允许我代表文学艺术界单位和我自己，对于周恩来副主席的政治报告表示热烈的拥护；对于陈叔通副主席的工作报告和中国人民政治协商会议章程草案表示完全同意，并建议全体会议予以通过。
