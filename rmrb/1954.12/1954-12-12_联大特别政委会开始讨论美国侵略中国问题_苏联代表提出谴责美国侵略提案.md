Xinhua News Agency, New York, 11th – TASS reports: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee began discussing on December 9th the issue raised by the Soviet delegation concerning acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China and the responsibility of the U.S. Navy for these acts.

    The Soviet delegation presented the following proposal at the meeting:

   “The General Assembly, noting that the recent cessation of the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina have created favorable conditions for resolving other outstanding international issues and further easing international tensions,

    Expressing concern that armed forces under U.S. control are carrying out acts of aggression in the vicinity of Taiwan and in the China Sea in the form of unprovoked armed attacks on Chinese cities and coastal areas, turning this region into a new breeding ground for war and posing a serious threat to peace,

    And determining that piratical attacks on merchant ships of all countries on the high seas, the seizure of these ships, and the use of violence against their crews are being carried out by armed forces stationed in the aforementioned areas,

    Condemns such acts of aggression that threaten peace and security in the Far East and recommends that the United States government, which bears full responsibility for the current situation in this region, take the necessary measures to cease the aforementioned acts of aggression and to stop the piratical attacks on merchant ships of all countries."

    The Soviet representative, Sobolev, pointed out in his speech that the U.S. armed forces have violated China's sovereignty and broken international agreements by forcibly occupying Taiwan and continuing to exercise military control over it.

    Sobolev said that the Soviet delegation submitted this issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion because the situation in the Taiwan Island and China Sea region has not improved recently, but has instead become more tense due to the increasing frequency of acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China.

    The Soviet representative emphasized that the U.S. acts of aggression are intended to further intensify the situation in the Far East and to diminish the significance of the measures taken by peace-loving countries to ease international tensions.

    Sobolev said that the aforementioned acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China, which threaten the cause of maintaining peace in the Far East, are incompatible with the task of maintaining universal peace and security and are incompatible with the peaceful principles of the United Nations, and should be condemned by the United Nations General Assembly. The United Nations General Assembly should demand that the United States government, which is responsible for the situation created in this region, take the necessary measures to stop the acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China.

    The U.S. representative, Jackson, who spoke next, was unable to refute the specific facts of aggression against the People's Republic of China presented by the Soviet representative, acts of aggression that were carried out or supported by the U.S. armed forces.

    联大特别政委会开始讨论美国侵略中国问题
    苏联代表提出谴责美国侵略提案
   【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会十二月九日开始讨论苏联代表团所提出的关于侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任问题。
    苏联代表团在会上提出一项提案如下：
   “大会指出：最近朝鲜战争的停止和印度支那的恢复和平，为解决其他未决的国际问题和进一步缓和国际紧张局势创造了有利的条件，
    忧虑地指出：美国控制下的武装力量在台湾附近和中国海采取对中国的城市和沿海地区无端武装攻击的方式，进行侵略行动，使这个地区变成新的战争策源地，并且形成对和平的严重威胁，
    并且确定：在公海对各国的商船进行海盗式的袭击，劫夺这些船只并且用暴力对付它们的船员，是驻扎在上述地区的武装力量所进行的，
    谴责这种威胁远东和平和安全的侵略行为，并建议对这个地区目前的局面负完全责任的美国政府采取必要的措施，以停止上述侵略行为，并且停止对各国商船的海盗式袭击。”
    苏联代表索波列夫在发言中指出，美国武装部队侵犯中国主权和破坏国际协定，强占了台湾，并且在继续对它实行军事控制。
    索波列夫说，苏联代表团把这个问题提交联合国大会讨论的出发点是：台湾岛和中国海地区的情况最近不但没有好转，反而由于对中华人民共和国的侵略行为的日益频繁而紧张起来了。
    苏联代表着重指出，美国的侵略行为是为了要使远东局势更加紧张，并且要缩小根据爱好和平国家缓和国际紧张局势的倡议所采取的措施的意义。
    索波列夫说，上述使维持远东和平的事业受到威胁的、侵略中华人民共和国的行为，是和维护普遍和平和安全的任务不相容的，是和联合国的和平原则不相容的，联合国大会应当加以谴责。联合国大会应当要求要对在这个地区所造成的局势负责的美国政府，采取必要措施以停止侵略中华人民共和国的行为。
    接着发言的美国代表杰克逊没有能够反驳苏联代表所提出的侵略中华人民共和国的具体事实，这些侵略行为是美国武装部队所进行或者为他们所支持的。
