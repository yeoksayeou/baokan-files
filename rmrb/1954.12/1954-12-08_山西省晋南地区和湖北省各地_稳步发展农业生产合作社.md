    Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Southern Shanxi and Hubei Province
    Steadily Develop

    Since the autumn, the agricultural cooperativization movement in the Jinan area of Shanxi Province has greatly developed. As of November 25, among the original 2,190 old cooperatives in the area, 1,494 had completed the work of expanding the cooperatives, adding a total of more than 51,900 member households; another 551 old cooperatives were in the process of expanding, with more than 12,900 farm households applying to join. The work of establishing new cooperatives has also made great progress. Currently, 4,502 agricultural production cooperatives have been established or are being established, with more than 126,000 participating farm households. As a result, more than 245,000 farm households in the Jinan area have joined agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for 30% of the total number of farm households in the area. At present, this movement is developing steadily. By the end of the year, it is estimated that the number of farm households participating in agricultural production cooperatives will reach more than 32% of the total number of farm households in the area.

    By mid-November, Hubei Province had newly established 3,976 agricultural production cooperatives. Together with the original 1,065 old cooperatives, a total of 5,041 cooperatives have been established, with more than 137,000 farm households joining agricultural production cooperatives. Before establishing cooperatives, all localities carefully selected the targets for establishing cooperatives and trained a large number of key personnel. A general education on the general line was carried out for mutual aid groups preparing to transfer to cooperatives to raise their socialist awareness. In some places, after the establishment of new cooperatives, new members were organized to visit old cooperatives to learn on-site. For example, two newly established cooperatives in Xiaohekou Township, Mianyang County, organized 61 members and activists to visit Shaling Cooperative to observe production conditions and learn management methods, which greatly helped to increase the confidence of new members in running the cooperatives and enrich their experience in running cooperatives.

    山西省晋南地区和湖北省各地
    稳步发展农业生产合作社
    山西省晋南地区的农业合作化运动，秋季以来有了很大的发展。到十一月二十五日，全区原有的二千一百九十个老社中，有一千四百九十四个社完成了扩大社的工作，共扩大了五万一千九百多户社员；另有五百五十一个老社正在进行扩社工作，已有一万二千九百余农户报名参加。新建社的工作也有很大发展，现在已经建成和正在建立的农业生产合作社已达四千五百零二个，参加的农户达十二万六千余户。至此，晋南地区参加农业生产合作社的农户已达二十四万五千余户，占全区农户总数的百分之三十。目前，这一运动正在稳健地向前发展，到年底，参加农业生产合作社的农户，预计将达全区农户的百分之三十二以上。（本报山西记者站）
    湖北省新建成的农业生产合作社，到十一月中旬止已达三千九百七十六个，连同原有的一千零六十五个老社，共建立了五千零四十一个社，加入农业生产合作社的农户共十三万七千余户。各地在建社以前，都慎重地选择了建社对象，训练了大批骨干；对准备转社的互助组普遍进行一次总路线的教育，提高他们的社会主义觉悟。有些地方在新社建立后，组织新社员到老社参观，实地学习。如沔阳县小河口乡两个新建社，组织了六十一个社员和积极分子，到沙岭社参观生产情形和学习经营管理方法，这对提高新社员办社信心和充实办社经验都有很大帮助。（本报湖北记者站）
