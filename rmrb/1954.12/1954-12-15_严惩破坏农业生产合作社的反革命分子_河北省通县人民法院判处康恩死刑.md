Severely Punish Counter-Revolutionaries Who Sabotage Agricultural Production Cooperatives
Kang En Sentenced to Death by Tongxian People's Court of Hebei Province

The Tongxian People's Court of Hebei Province recently sentenced the counter-revolutionary Kang En to death and immediate execution, stripped of political rights for life, and confiscated personal property to compensate the agricultural production cooperative for the losses at the original price. Kang En poisoned three heads of livestock in the agricultural production cooperative and conspired to undermine it. With the approval of the Hebei Provincial People's Court, the execution by shooting was carried out on November 25.

Kang En, 51 years old this year, was from Xinggezhuang Village, Xinggezhuang Township, Tongxian County. As early as the "July 7th" Incident, he participated in the "Universal Morality Society" organized by the Japanese puppets, and in early 1943 he joined the counter-revolutionary organization "I-Kuan Tao" as a altar master. From then on, he developed followers and actively carried out counter-revolutionary activities. When the People's Government explicitly banned "I-Kuan Tao," Kang En only registered as a general follower, attempting to hide and wait for an opportunity to continue his counter-revolutionary activities.

Since last winter, the farmers of Xinggezhuang, educated by the general task of the state during the transition period, have actively prepared for and established agricultural production cooperatives. In order to sabotage the vigorously developing cooperative movement, the counter-revolutionary Kang En pretended to be active and took the opportunity to join the Liu Delin Agricultural Production Cooperative, becoming the leader of the field technology guidance group and the livestock breeder. In order to achieve his goal of collapsing the cooperative, Kang En, on the one hand, showed himself to be "capable," and on the other hand, spread rumors among the members that the cooperative director Liu Delin was undemocratic in his style and did not understand agricultural production technology, trying every possible means to provoke the relationship between the members and the cooperative cadres, in an attempt to steal the leadership of the cooperative. When this conspiracy failed, he used the excuse that the grinding medicine group did not settle accounts (in fact, the grinding medicine group's accounts had been settled, only because the main cadres in the cooperative went to the county for a meeting and did not announce it to the members), inciting the members to say: "Can't you see? The grinding medicine group's accounts are not settled. Who knows what it will be like at the end of the year? If it doesn't work out well, it's better to work independently." At this time, more than a dozen members who were digging mud pits were deceived and stopped working for a day and a half for no reason. During the spring sowing season, Kang En, in his capacity as the "leader of the field technology guidance group," allowed the members to sow less seeds, causing serious phenomena such as seedling deficiency in the spring fields and the destruction of early seedlings and late sowing of seedlings, causing great losses to production. Kang En also often used the excuse of using livestock and scoring points to deliberately quarrel and create chaos. Finally, in order to completely collapse the agricultural production cooperative, Kang En openly poisoned three heads of livestock in the cooperative. The cooperative had two public donkeys and one cow and one mule each, and Kang En's donkey was also raised and used by the cooperative. These livestock were all raised by Kang En. On the morning of May 19, he fed the mule beancakes mixed with realgar he had prepared in advance. After the medicine took effect, he pretended to be calm and even complained that others did not take care of the livestock when using them; after the mule died in the afternoon, the criminal Kang was afraid of being seen through by the members, so he used the excuse that the government had ordered that the hides of dead livestock could not be skinned and sold, and immediately asked the members to bury the dead mule. On May 22, Kang En used the same method to poison a donkey in the cooperative. At this time, he was afraid of causing suspicion among the members, so he shouted to the members that his donkey was not eating grass, and fed his donkey two doses of medicine to cover the eyes of the members. After Kang En poisoned two heads of livestock, seeing that the members did not notice, on May 29, he mixed iron nails and other things in the grass and killed a draft cattle in the cooperative, and wanted to bury the killed cattle using the previous method. At this time, the members became suspicious. After dissecting the cow's stomach, many iron nails, copper wires, and other objects were found in the stomach, and they suddenly realized. Subsequently, the corpses of the previously dead donkeys and mules were exhumed, and after testing by the forensic laboratory of the Beijing Municipal People's Court and two other hospitals, it was confirmed that these two livestock also died of poisoning.

Kang En's criminal activities to sabotage the agricultural production cooperative in every possible way aroused great anger among the members, who immediately filed a complaint with the Tongxian People's Court. Based on the criminal facts of the counter-revolutionary Kang En, the Tongxian People's Court arrested him and conducted a detailed interrogation. Although the counter-revolutionary Kang En tried his best to quibble, he finally confessed his guilt in the face of human and material evidence.

    严惩破坏农业生产合作社的反革命分子
    河北省通县人民法院判处康恩死刑
    河北省通县人民法院最近判处了毒死农业生产合作社牲畜三头、阴谋搞垮农业生产合作社的反革命分子康恩死刑立即执行，剥夺政治权利终身，并没收康犯个人财产按原价赔偿农业生产合作社的损失。经报请河北省人民法院批准，已于十一月二十五日执行枪决。
    康恩今年五十一岁，通县邢各庄乡邢各庄村人，早在“七七”事变时，就参加了日伪筹办的“万国道德会”，一九四三年初又加入反革命组织“一贯道”为坛主。从那时起，他就发展道徒，积极进行反革命活动。在人民政府明令取缔“一贯道”时，康恩却只登记为一般道徒，企图敛形匿迹伺机继续进行反革命活动。
    去冬以来，邢各庄的农民受到国家过渡时期总任务的教育，积极筹备和成立农业生产合作社。反革命分子康恩为了破坏蓬勃发展的合作运动，就假装积极，乘机混进刘德林农业生产合作社，并当上了田园技术指导组组长和牲畜饲养员。康恩为了达到把社搞垮的目的，平日一面表现自己“能干”，一面又在社员中撒布社长刘德林作风不民主、不懂农业生产技术的谣言，千方百计地挑拨社员和社干部之间的关系，企图窃取社的领导权。当他这一阴谋未能得逞时，就又借口轧药组不结账（实际上轧药组的账已结齐，只因社内主要干部到县去开会，没有向社员公布），煽动社员说：“你们看不见吗？轧药组的账不给结，谁知道干一年最后落个啥样子啊？若是闹不好，干脆还不如单干哩。”这时有十多个挖坑泥的社员受了欺骗，无故停了一天半工。在春季播种时，康恩又以“田园技术指导组组长”的身份让社员少撒种籽，造成春地缺苗和毁掉早苗播种晚苗的严重现象，使生产受到很大损失。康恩还经常以使用牲口和评分多少为借口，故意吵闹，制造混乱。最后，康恩为了彻底把农业生产合作社搞垮，竟公然毒死社内三头牲口。这个社共有公有驴两头，牛、骡各一头，康恩的一头驴也由社喂养使用。这几头牲口都归康恩喂养。五月十九日的早晨，他把预先准备的信石夹在饽饽内喂了骡子。药性发作后，他假装镇静，还埋怨别人使用时不爱护牲口；午后骡子死去，康犯怕被社员看破，便借口政府有命令，病死的牲口不能剥皮卖肉，立即让社员把死去的骡子埋掉。五月二十二日，康恩又用同样的手段把社内的一头驴毒死。这时他怕引起社员怀疑，就向社员们声嚷自己的驴不吃草了，并喂了自己的驴两剂药，来掩盖社员的眼睛。康恩毒死了两头牲口以后，见社员没有发觉，在五月二十九日，又用铁钉等物搀在草内，把社内的一头耕牛害死，还想用以前的办法把害死的牛埋掉。这时，社员们都怀疑起来了。经解剖牛胃，在胃里发现了许多铁钉、铜丝等物，才恍然大悟。随后又把原来死去的驴骡尸体扒出，经过北京市人民法院法医室和另外两个医院的化验，证实这两头牲口也是中毒死去的。
    康恩千方百计破坏农业生产合作社的罪恶活动，引起了社员们的极大愤怒，他们立即向通县人民法院提起控诉。通县人民法院根据反革命分子康恩的犯罪事实，把他逮捕起来，并进行了详细审讯。反革命分子康恩虽曾百般狡赖，但在人证物证面前，终于低头认罪。
