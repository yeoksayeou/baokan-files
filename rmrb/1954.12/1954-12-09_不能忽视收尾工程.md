    Cannot Neglect Finishing Touches
    By Our Correspondent Chen Ji
    Many basic construction departments in Zhengzhou have put forward a slogan: we must brilliantly complete the finishing touches of basic construction. Although this slogan is correct, it is rarely truly realized.
    The Production Work Zone of the Henan Provincial Textile Bureau Engineering Company used to do good work. In the construction of the factory buildings for the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, they repeatedly overfulfilled their tasks. However, when this work zone had just completed the main project of the factory building and began to transition to the finishing stage, some leading cadres developed a sense of relaxation and complacency. Huang Fushen, the director of the work zone, saw that the finishing touches were small and fragmented, and therefore thought: "We have done well in the past when we did big projects; what is this small 'butt-wiping' project!" He used to focus on preparing the construction plan for the next month around the 20th of each month; now he rarely personally oversees this work. The leading cadres of the work zone had painstakingly established a system of dynamic analysis meetings, studying the problems in construction every day and solving them in a timely manner. Now this system is gradually becoming ineffective. The people attending the analysis meetings were listless, not as serious as they used to be in studying and solving the problems that occurred in construction in a timely manner. When the cadres below saw that the leading cadres were not nervous, they all breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that "the work is about to end, we can be sloppy." The November construction plan was compiled five or six days later than in the past. Engineer Wang Shaogang wrote out an increase production and practice economy target like he was just going through the motions, and handed it to Huang Fushen. Huang Fushen looked at it, did not study it carefully, and only said: "Let's have a meeting and decide later!" Afterwards, Huang Fushen forgot to hold the meeting, and the increase production and practice economy target could not be determined.
    At the beginning of November, when the work zone issued the plan to the work sections, the work sections felt that it was "unworkable" and put forward their opinions one after another:
    "The November plan is too unrealistic! Our pump room hasn't been poured with concrete yet, but the plan wants us to plaster the walls. How can we construct according to this plan?"
    "Everyone was shouting about increasing production and practicing economy in October, why is there no increase production and practice economy target in November?"
    After the work sections raised their opinions, the work zone had to withdraw the November plan and announce that it would be "revised and formulated again." In early November, the work sections had no plan, and work morale began to decline. The workers were not at ease with their work, they said: "We have been tense for several months, now it's time to relax." "There is no important work this month, why be nervous?" Some workers secretly left the site half an hour before the end of work and went to the dormitory. At work, groups of three or five workers sat together, smoking, chatting, and telling jokes. Some people were planning to go home, and some were planning to transfer to other projects. They were not as focused on their work as they were a few months ago.
    In this relaxed atmosphere, this production work zone, which had once overfulfilled its tasks, could not maintain its past glory. The boiler room and pump room it contracted were completed several days late. Many project quotas could not be met. The terrazzo quota was five square meters, but the actual achievement was only three square meters. The bricklaying quota was 1,240 bricks, but the actual achievement was only about 800 bricks. The quality of the project was also poor. Within six days in November, there were nine quality accidents, constantly causing rework.
    This situation was serious enough, but the leaders of the production work zone were still not in a hurry. In the past, they would have held meetings very nervously to study countermeasures when they encountered this situation; now they didn't care much, always thinking: "It doesn't matter if the finishing touches are a little worse." But they don't know: if the finishing touches are not done well, the new factory cannot be put into production, the construction unit cannot transfer to new construction projects in a timely manner, and the country's construction plan will be damaged. Many lessons have already proved this point. The Henan People's Theater in Zhengzhou was originally planned to be completed at the end of August this year; however, due to the chaos in the finishing work, it was not fully completed until early October. The Henan Workers' Sanatorium was delayed again and again when the project was about to be completed, and it took two or three months to barely complete it. Some projects have become cross-year projects because of poor finishing work. Some construction units do not clean up materials and tools, and do not do a good job in financial settlement work during the finishing stage, so that funds cannot be turned over to the state treasury in a timely manner. The Henan Provincial Construction Engineering Company built the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory in 1952. Because it did not do a good job in financial settlement work, it took more than a year to finally make a final account in May of this year. This prominent example is by no means an isolated case. This year, more than 90% of the projects completed by the Henan Provincial Construction Engineering Company have not made final accounts, affecting the turnover and utilization of national construction funds.
    There is less than a month left this year, and the completion of the plan by the basic construction departments in Zhengzhou is not good enough. At the end of October, the basic construction units in the city only completed 73.5% of the plan. One of the factors for not completing the plan is the failure to do a good job in finishing touches. People are eagerly looking forward to the basic construction units in Zhengzhou realizing their slogan as soon as possible—brilliantly ending this year's project.

### 不能忽视收尾工程

    不能忽视收尾工程
    本报记者　陈迹
    郑州市许多基本建设部门曾经提出一个口号，就是必须精采地结束基本建设的收尾工程。这个口号虽然正确，真正实现的却很少。
    河南省纺织管理局工程公司的生产工区过去工作还不错。在修筑国营郑州第三棉纺织厂厂房工程中，曾经一再地超额完成任务。但是这个工区在刚刚修好厂房的主要工程、开始转入收尾工程阶段的时候，有些领导干部却滋长着松懈和自满的情绪。工区主任黄浮沈眼看收尾工程很小，又很零碎，因而觉得：“过去做大工程，都做好了；现在这点‘擦屁股’的小工程算得了什么！”他以往在每个月的二十日左右就抓紧下个月施工计划的编制工作；现在他却很少亲自过问这种工作。工区的领导干部曾经好容易建立起一种动态分析会议的制度，每天研究施工中的问题，并及时加以解决。现在这种制度也渐渐不起作用了。参加分析会议的人没精打采，不像过去那样认真地研究和及时地解决施工中发生的问题。下面的干部看见领导干部不紧张，也都松了一口气，以为“工作快结束了，可以马虎一些。”十一月份施工计划比过去迟了五六天才编制出来。工程师王绍纲像应付差事似地临时写出个增产节约的指标，交给黄浮沈。黄浮沈看了看，也没仔细研究，只说道：“开个会议，再决定吧！”事后，黄浮沈忘了开会，增产节约的指标也没能确定下来。
    十一月初，工区把计划发给工段，工段感到“行不通”，纷纷提出意见：
    “十一月份计划太不切合实际！我们水泵房还没浇灌混凝土哩，计划却要我们粉刷墙壁。按照这种计划，怎么施工呀？”
    “十月份大家叫喊增产节约，为什么十一月份没有增产节约的指标？”
    工段提出意见后，工区只好收回十一月份计划，宣布“重新修改、制订。”十一月上旬，工段没有计划，工作情绪开始低落。工人们不安心工作，他们说：“紧张了几个月，现在也该松松劲了。”“这个月也没啥重要工作，干吗紧张呢？”有些工人在下班前半个钟头，就偷偷地离开现场，往宿舍走去。在上班的时候，三五成群的工人，围坐一起，抽烟、聊天、说笑话。有的人计划着回家，有的人打算着转入别的工程去。他们不像几个月前那样专心一致地工作。
    在这种松懈的气氛里，这个曾经超额完成任务的生产工区不能保持它过去的光荣。它承建的锅炉房、水泵房，都迟了好几天才竣工。许多工程的定额，也不能达到。水磨石的定额是五平方公尺，实际只达到三平方公尺。砌墙的定额是一千二百四十块，实际只达到八百块左右。工程质量也不好。在十一月的六天内，就发生九次质量事故，不断地造成返工的现象。
    这种情况已经够严重了，但生产工区的领导人员还不慌不忙。在过去他们碰到这种情况时都非常紧张地召开会议研究对策；现在他们却不大在乎，总还以为：“收尾工程差一点，也没啥关系。”但是他们不知道：收尾工程做得不好，新建的工厂就不能投入生产，施工的单位就不能及时转入新的建设工程去，国家的建设计划就会遭到破坏。许多教训，已经证明了这一点。郑州市河南人民剧院本来计划在今年八月底建成；但由于收尾工作的混乱，迟至十月初，还未完全竣工。河南工人疗养院在工程快完成的时候，一拖再拖，拖了两三个月，才勉强地完工。有些工程因为收尾工作不好，变成了跨年度的工程。有些施工单位在收尾阶段，不清理材料、工具，不做好财务结算工作，使得资金不能及时上缴国库。河南省建筑工程公司在一九五二年修建国营郑州第二棉纺织厂，因为未做好财务结算工作，拖了一年多，才好容易在今年五月做出决算。这个突出的例子，还决不是个别的。今年河南省建筑工程公司已经竣工的工程，有百分之九十以上未做出决算，影响国家建设资金的周转和利用。
    今年还剩不到一个月了，郑州市各基本建设部门完成计划的情况还不够好。十月底，全市各基本建设单位才完成计划的百分之七十三点五。完不成计划的因素之一，就是没做好收尾工程。人们都在殷切地盼望着：郑州市各基本建设单位赶快实现自己的口号—精采地结束今年的工程。
