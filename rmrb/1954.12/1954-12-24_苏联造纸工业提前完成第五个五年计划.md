    Soviet Paper Industry Completes Fifth Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 23rd: The Soviet paper industry has completed the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) ahead of schedule. According to this Five-Year Plan, paper production in 1955 should have increased by 46 percent compared to 1950, but this level has now been exceeded.

    The Soviet Union's paper production has greatly increased. In 1954, the amount of paper and cardboard supplied to publishing houses was approximately three times that of 1940. Currently, the paper and fiber produced by the Balakhna and Kama combined factories alone is more than the entire paper and fiber industry of Russia before the revolution in 1913.

    苏联造纸工业提前完成第五个五年计划
    【新华社莫斯科二十三日电】苏联的造纸工业已经提前完成了第五个五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）。根据这个五年计划，一九五五年纸张的产量应比一九五零年增加百分之四十六，但是现在这个水平已经被超过了。
    苏联的纸张产量已经大大增加。一九五四年供给各出版局的纸张和厚纸约增为一九四零年的三倍。现在，仅巴拉赫纳和卡马的两个联合工厂所出产的纸张和纤维，就比革命前一九一三年俄国整个造纸和纤维工业的产量还要多。
