Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 9th (TASS): Louis Saillant delivered a report at the World Federation of Trade Unions Council meeting on December 9th.

    At the beginning of his report, Louis Saillant pointed out the importance of the World Federation of Trade Unions' Third Congress, which adopted several important resolutions regarding the work of national and international trade union organizations. He said that since that congress, the World Federation of Trade Unions' influence in various countries around the world has been further strengthened.

    The World Federation of Trade Unions supports the policy of defending peace through negotiations. It is an international organization that condemns the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons and demands the prohibition of their manufacture. These issues are not merely related to trade unions or industrial workers. They are of vital importance to millions of organized and unorganized working people around the world. Working people hope to end the current international tensions. They hope for peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Working people hope to put the war-makers in a position where they cannot do harm.

    Working people realize that the world is facing a serious and direct threat today. After the rejection of the European Defense Community, working people expected that Western governments would pay attention to the will of the people. However, less than two months after the people achieved this victory, the London and Paris Agreements were signed, and their purpose was to revive West German militarism.

    Less than ten years have passed since Hitler's armies were defeated, and the question of reviving a German army composed of the same elements and dragging it into an aggressive bloc has arisen again. The danger lies here, and working people see the threat to European security here.

    We are told that there is no other way to resolve international disputes except to revive German militarism. We disagree with this statement. We declare to Western governments that a collective security system including all European countries—regardless of their systems—is not only a path leading to peace but also a path that can lead to a genuine easing of international tensions, effective disarmament, increased welfare for working people, and the guarantee that the seeds of war are eliminated.

    We extend our warm respect to the German working people in their country who have heroically risen up against the militarists and former Hitlerite generals responsible for the disasters suffered by the working people. We salute our brothers and sisters in West Germany who are waging this noble struggle. We extend our fraternal hand to them and support them on the path they have already taken. We want to tell the working men and women of Britain that we support all those who clearly see the current danger. We urge them not to isolate themselves from their brothers and sisters in France, Italy, the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and all other European countries, who believe that the working people of Britain can make a significant contribution to the struggle against the revival of German militarism.

    Nineteen fifty-four clearly demonstrated that the working masses are capable of preventing the implementation of plans aimed at turning West Germany into a hotbed for another world war.

    Louis Saillant then spoke about the deterioration of the living standards of working people in capitalist countries and their increasingly high-spirited struggle for their rights. He said that in the past year, real wages in these countries have decreased, and labor intensity has increased. The working day has been extended. Unemployment has increased. Monopoly capital, with the assistance of governments serving their interests, is exploiting workers' earnings to increase their already enormous profits. To more easily achieve their goals and thwart any attempts by workers to resist their plans, monopoly capital is seeking to create an atmosphere of terror in industrial enterprises, systematically depriving trade unions of their rights and infringing on the democratic freedoms of working people.

    However, despite all this persecution, working people refuse to tolerate the deterioration of their living conditions.

    After the World Federation of Trade Unions' Third Congress, the struggles to meet the urgent demands of working people in Britain, West Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and other countries further expanded.

    This struggle is constantly supported by the World Federation of Trade Unions and its centers in various countries. Now, in all capitalist, colonial, and backward countries, working people are demanding wage increases.

    Even in the United States, the leading bodies of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations have had to take into account the workers' discontent and make a gesture of being advocates of wage increases. Workers' actions demanding wage increases are growing despite brutal repression.

    In view of the imperialists' brazen attacks on trade union rights, and in view of the serious consequences that this action brings to millions of workers and their families, the World Federation of Trade Unions has decided to formulate a charter of trade union rights for working people. In this way, the World Federation of Trade Unions will be able to provide a new weapon to working people who are resisting the attacks of capitalists and governments serving capitalists. With the help of this charter, working people will be able to conduct a broader and more effective struggle to win, guarantee, or expand their trade union rights and democratic rights.

    Louis Saillant went on to say that monopoly capital, in order to obtain maximum profits, is adopting the method of directly reducing wages. This situation is common not only in backward countries such as Mexico and Malaya but also in Western European countries, especially Sweden and France, as well as in the United States and Japan. For example, in Japan, Amagasaki Steel Works and Kansai Metallurgical Company have reduced basic wages by 20% and cancelled special allowances. In the United States, Studebaker Corporation in South Bend has forcibly reduced wages by 14%.

    In capitalist countries, working and living conditions are constantly deteriorating. According to official materials, in the period from 1948 to 1953, the average cost of living increased by an average of 34% in the United States, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. The number of unemployed increased by an average of 19%.

    Louis Saillant pointed out that at the same time, the profits of monopoly capital are constantly increasing. For example, in the United States, the profits of monopoly capital were $32.8 billion in 1948 and $39.4 billion in 1953, an increase of 20%.

    In Britain, total profits amounted to £2.52 billion in 1948 and £3.44 billion in 1953.

    Louis Saillant pointed out that the economic militarization of capitalist countries has recently increased the economic difficulties of capitalist countries. He pointed out that the foundation of international trade in capitalist countries is poor, and it is not based on the principle of mutual benefit. He said that economically developed countries, especially the United States, force weaker countries to accept unfavorable agreements, thereby hindering the development of these countries and often seriously disrupting their economic balance.

    Louis Saillant said that the trade discrimination policy enforced by American monopoly capital is full of dangerous consequences.

    Therefore, the correct path is to expand the domestic market by increasing residents' purchasing power and to expand the foreign market by restoring normal international trade relations.

    Louis Saillant explained the basic tasks facing working people in capitalist countries in terms of social and economic demands. He said that trade unions must fight to increase the purchasing power of wages. In every country, the struggle to increase wages must become the basis of a whole series of demands, thereby enhancing the solidarity of working people; if necessary, this should also be the case within a single industry. We must demand shorter working hours without reducing wages, implement or improve social insurance systems, and implement a system of paid holidays. We must formulate a common program based on these demands, unifying the activities of various trade union organizations and workers to strive for the realization of this program.

    Louis Saillant emphasized that the living standards of the Soviet people are constantly improving. The People's Republic of China has made remarkable achievements in socialist industrialization and improving the material and cultural living standards of its residents. The production and consumption capacity of the people's democracies is also rapidly increasing. Currently, the production volume of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania has increased to more than three times that of pre-war levels.

    Louis Saillant said that we are proud that the ranks of the World Federation of Trade Unions include such trade union organizations and millions of workers whose work is an example of the high political maturity of the working class in striving for social progress and human welfare.

    Louis Saillant then pointed out that now, there is a strong tendency towards unity in the entire working-class movement. The World Federation of Trade Unions' Third Congress was a clear manifestation of this desire for unity. After the Third Congress, the working people of Argentina, Britain, Japan, India, Brazil, Chile, France, Italy, the Scandinavian countries, West Germany, and many countries in Africa and the Middle East have greatly expanded their common struggles to defend their social and economic demands, trade union and democratic rights.

    However, the leadership of the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" suppresses the working masses' desire for unity, even suppressing this desire expressed by its own members. It tries its best to oppose approaching the World Federation of Trade Unions. This is the result of pressure exerted by certain American trade union leaders, especially the heads of the American Federation of Labor, who have a strong influence on the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions."

    Louis Saillant said that millions of intellectual and manual laborers regard the World Federation of Trade Unions' action program and purpose as their own action program and purpose. Therefore, they are worthy of the glorious title of advocates of unity.

    The slogan of unity is not new; it is a courageous slogan that will surely be supported by all trade unions. Our most noble responsibility is to universally strengthen unity in order to force monopoly capitalists and the governments under their control to raise wages and increase social welfare, in order to effectively fight against capitalist exploitation, strive for economic development, and crush the poverty policies implemented by imperialism that cause suffering to millions of people.

    Unite universally and launch a struggle for trade union and democratic rights; strengthen the organized strength of working people in enterprises and residential areas, in every country and internationally; further enhance the combat effectiveness of trade union organizations to achieve one victory after another!

    Unite universally and strive for the victory of the people of all countries who are fighting for their national independence!

    Our responsibility is to strengthen unity, to fight for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, to stop the rearmament of West Germany, and to pave the way for reaching agreements on collective security in Europe and the world.

    赛扬在世界工联理事会会议上的报告（摘要）
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙九日电：路易·赛扬十二月九日在世界工会联合会理事会会议上作了报告。
    路易·赛扬在报告的开头指出了曾通过若干关于各国和国际工会组织工作的重要决议的世界工会第三次代表大会的重要意义。他说，在那次代表大会以后，世界工会联合会在世界各国的影响进一步地加强了。
    世界工会联合会支持通过谈判来保卫和平的政策。它是一个斥责使用原子武器和氢武器、要求禁止制造这些武器的国际组织。这些问题不只是同工会或产业工人有关的问题。它们是对世界上千百万组织起来的和未组织起来的劳动人民有切身重要关系的问题。劳动人民希望结束目前的国际紧张局势。他们希望不同社会制度的国家之间和平共处。劳动人民希望能把战争制造者置于使这些人不能为害的境地。
    劳动人民认识到，世界今天遭受到严重的、直接的威胁。在欧洲防务集团被拒绝以后，劳动人民期望，西方国家政府会注意人民的意志。然而，在人民获得这个胜利以后不到两个月，伦敦和巴黎协定就签订了，而它们的目的是复活西德的军国主义。
    自从希特勒军队被击溃以来还不到十年，关于复活由同样的分子组成的德国军队和把它拖入侵略集团的问题又出现了。危险就在这里，劳动人民看到对欧洲安全的威胁就在这里。
    有人告诉我们说，除了复活德国军国主义以外，别无其他解决国际争端的办法。我们不同意这种说法。我们向西方国家政府宣布，包括一切欧洲国家——不论它们的制度如何——在内的集体安全体系，不仅是导向和平的道路，而且是能够导向真正缓和国际紧张局势、有效裁军、增进劳动人民福利和保证战争萌芽得以消灭的道路。
    我们对于在他们的国家中英勇地起来反对应对劳动人民所受的灾难负责的军国主义者和前希特勒将军们的德国劳动人民致热烈的敬意。我们向我们的正在西德进行这种崇高的斗争的兄弟姊妹们致敬。我们向他们伸出我们的兄弟之手，并且支持他们走他们已经走上的道路。我们要告诉英国的劳动男女，我们支持一切清楚地看到目前的危险的人们。我们要求他们不要使他们自己从他们在法国、意大利、苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和其他一切欧洲国家的兄弟姊妹们孤立开来，这些国家的兄弟姊妹们都认为英国的劳动人民是能够在反对复活德国军国主义的斗争中作出巨大贡献的。
    一九五四年明显地表现出劳动群众是能够阻止执行目的在把西德变成另一次世界大战的温床的计划的。
    路易·赛扬然后谈到资本主义国家劳动人民生活水平的恶化和他们愈来愈高涨的争取他们的权利的斗争。他说，去年这些国家内的实际工资下降了，劳动强度加强了。劳动日延长了。失业人数有了增加。垄断资本在为他们的利益服务的政府的援助下，正在剥削工人的所得，来增加他们已经庞大无比的利润。为了更容易地实现他们的目的和击破工人方面抵制他们的计划的任何企图，垄断资本正设法在工业企业中制造恐怖空气，有计划地剥夺工会权利和侵犯劳动人民的民主自由。
    然而，劳动人民不顾这一切迫害，拒绝容忍他们的生活情况恶化的现象。
    在世界工会第三次代表大会后，英国、西德、法国、意大利、日本、阿根廷、智利、巴西、和其他国家内为满足劳动人民的迫切要求而进行的斗争进一步扩大了。
    这个斗争不断地得到世界工会联合会、它在各国的中心的支持。现在在所有资本主义国家、殖民地国家和落后国家中，劳动人民都在要求增加工资。
    甚至在美国，美国劳工联合会和产业工会联合会的领导机构也不得不考虑到工人的不满情绪，而做出是要求增加工资的拥护者的姿态。工人们要求增加工资的行动正不顾残酷的镇压而增长起来。
    鉴于帝国主义者无耻地向工会权利进攻的行动，鉴于这种行动为千百万工人和他们的家庭带来严重后果，世界工会联合会决定要制定一个劳动人民工会权利宪章。这样，世界工会联合会将能够给正在抵抗资本家和为资本家服务的政府的进攻的劳动人民提供一个新的武器。在这个宪章的帮助下，劳动人民将能进行更广泛和更有效的斗争，来争取、保障或扩大他们的工会权利和民主权利。
    路易·赛扬接着说，垄断资本为了要取得最大限度的利润，正在采用直接减低工资的办法。不仅在墨西哥和马来亚这样的落后国家内，而且在西欧国家、特别是瑞典和法国以及在美国和日本，这种情形都是屡见不鲜的。例如在日本，尼崎制钢所关西冶金公司已经把基本工资减低了百分之二十，并且取消了特别津贴。在美国，南本德的史蒂倍克汽车公司的资方已经强行把工资减低了百分之十四。
    在资本主义国家内，工作和生活的条件正在不断恶化。根据官方材料，在一九四八年至一九五三年这个时期内，在美国、日本、英国、法国、西德、芬兰、意大利、荷兰、比利时、奥地利、丹麦、瑞典和挪威这些国家，平均生活费用平均增加了百分之三十四。失业人数平均增加了百分之十九。
    路易·赛扬指出，同时，垄断资本的利润不断地增加。例如在美国，垄断资本在一九四八年的利润是三百二十八亿美元，一九五三年是三百九十四亿美元，增加了百分之二十。
    在英国，一九四八年的利润总共达二十五亿二千万英镑，在一九五三年是三十四亿四千万英镑。
    路易·赛扬指出，资本主义国家经济军事化的结果使得资本主义国家的经济困难最近又增加了。他指出，资本主义国家的国际贸易的基础是不好的，它是不以互利的原则为基础的。他说，经济比较发达的国家、首先是美国，强迫比较弱的国家接受不利的协定，从而妨碍这些国家的发展，而且往往严重地破坏它们的经济平衡。
    路易·赛扬说，美国垄断资本强迫实行的贸易歧视政策充满了危险的后果。
    因此，正确的道路就是通过增加居民购买力来扩大国内市场，通过恢复国际间正常贸易关系来扩大国外市场。
    路易·赛扬说明了资本主义国家劳动人民所面临的社会要求和经济要求方面的基本任务，他说，工会必须为争取提高工资购买能力而斗争。在每一个国家内，争取增加工资的斗争必须成为整个一系列要求的基础，从而增进劳动人民的团结；如果必要的话，在某一个单独的产业范围内，也应如此。我们必须要求缩短工作时间而不减少工资，实行或改善社会保险制度，实行假期工资照发的制度。我们必须根据这些要求制订出一个共同纲领，把各工会组织和工人的活动统一起来以争取这个纲领的实现。
    路易·赛扬着重指出，苏联人民的生活水平正在不断提高。中华人民共和国在社会主义工业化方面和提高居民的物质文化水平方面取得了显著的成绩。各人民民主国家的生产和消费能力也在迅速上升。目前波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的生产量已经增为战前的三倍多。
    路易·赛扬说，世界工会联合会的队伍里有这样一些工会组织和成百万工人，他们的工作是工人阶级在争取社会进步和人类福利方面政治上高度成熟的范例，我们因此而感到骄傲。
    路易·赛扬接着指出，现在，在整个工人阶级运动中出现了一种走向团结的强烈倾向。世界工会第三次代表大会就是这种要求团结一致的意志的明显的表现。在第三次代表大会之后，阿根廷、英国、日本、印度、巴西、智利、法国、意大利、斯堪的纳维亚半岛各国、西德以及非洲和中东的许多国家的劳动人民都大大地扩大了共同的斗争，维护他们的社会和经济要求、工会和民主权利。
    但是，“国际自由工会联合会”的领导压制劳动群众要求团结的意志，甚至连它自己的会员所表示出的这种意志都加以压制。它竭力反对同世界工会联合会接近。这是美国某些工会头子、特别是对“国际自由工会联合会”有强大影响的美国劳联的头子施加压力的结果。
    路易·赛扬说，千百万智力和体力劳动者把世界工会联合会的行动纲领和宗旨看作是自己的行动纲领和宗旨，因此，他们不愧为团结的拥护者这个光荣称号。
    团结的口号并不是新的东西；这是一个勇敢的口号，它一定会得到所有工会的支持。我们的最崇高的责任是普遍加强团结，以便迫使垄断资本家和在他们控制下的政府提高工资和增进社会福利，以便有效地进行斗争，反对资本主义剥削，争取经济发展，粉碎帝国主义实行的使千百万人遭到痛苦的贫困政策。
    普遍团结起来，展开争取工会和民主权利的斗争；在各企业和居民区，在每一个国家和国际范围内，加强劳动人民的有组织的力量；进一步提高工会组织的战斗力，以取得一个接着一个的胜利！
    普遍团结起来，争取为本国民族独立而斗争的各国人民的胜利！
    我们的责任是加强团结，为禁止原子武器和氢武器而斗争，为制止重新武装西德，为开辟在欧洲和世界集体安全问题上达成协议的道路而斗争。
