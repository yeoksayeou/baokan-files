    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 16th: According to TASS, the Second All-Union Congress of Writers opened on the 15th in the Kremlin, Moscow. Participating in the congress were representatives of writers' organizations from various Soviet Union republics, autonomous republics, border regions, and states, as well as many foreign writers and representatives of Moscow's workers, literary, and scientific workers.

    Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Bulganin, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Pervukhin, Saburov, Khrushchev, Shvernik, Pospelov, Suslov, and Shatalin were seated on the rostrum, greeted by enthusiastic applause from the delegates and guests.

    The congress was opened by the oldest Russian female writer, O. Forsch.

    All attendees first stood in silent tribute to J. V. Stalin.

    Attendees also stood to mourn the founder of Soviet literature, Gorky, and the writers who passed away between the first and second congresses.

    Forsch delivered the opening speech, saying that in the twenty years since the First All-Union Congress of Writers, the Soviet people have accomplished many glorious and heroic feats. For twenty years, Soviet literature has always been with the Soviet people, serving their great labor. Soviet literature is a powerful weapon for the Soviet people in building communism.

    Forsch continued, saying that Soviet literature is fighting for peace and for friendship among all peoples. The dark forces of imperialism have recently been colluding to launch a new bloody war. We must counter their evil will with our good will, with the power of people who believe in a bright future. Therefore, this requires our literature to play an important role in this task.

    The delegates unanimously elected the members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party as the honorary presidium of the congress.

    The delegates also elected the congress presidium, the congress secretariat, the credentials committee, and the drafting committee.

    Pospelov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, read the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party to the congress.

    The agenda of the congress included the following reports and supplementary reports: "On the Status and Tasks of Soviet Literature," "On Soviet Children's and Juvenile Literature," "On Soviet Poetry," "On Soviet Prose Literature," "On Soviet Drama," "On Soviet Film Scripts," "On the Translation of Soviet National Literatures," "On the Basic Problems of Soviet Literary Criticism," "On Contemporary World Progressive Literature."

    Surkov, First Secretary of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union, delivered a report at the meeting on "The Status and Tasks of Soviet Literature."

    The congress will last for eleven days, during which it will discuss and adopt new articles of association and re-elect the leading bodies of the association.
