    Winter on the Kundulun River
    By Our Correspondent Liu Heng
    December finds the Kundulun River near Baotou in the bitter cold of "water freezing into ice." The river is frozen two feet thick, and the snow in the mountains and fields is several inches deep. River and mountain, sky and earth, are a vast expanse of white, as if frozen into one whole.
    In this frigid weather of minus 30 to 40 degrees Celsius, more than a hundred people from the Beijing Geological Exploration and Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources and the Baotou Water Conservancy Bureau's drilling team are working day and night to provide design data for the reservoir.
    The drilling team arrived in September. The workers overcame various difficulties in the field: without carbide lamps, they worked by torchlight and small oil lamps. Without cars, they went barefoot into the icy water to carry the machines; when the circulating water for drilling froze, they used fire to thaw it; when the diesel fuel froze, they burned it. The workers said, "No matter how cold it is, it can't freeze our machines, our hearts." In November, the team's attendance rate reached 98 percent. The drilling team led by Lang Mingzhong achieved a 100 percent attendance rate for two consecutive months.
    The first women's drilling team in New China—the "March 8th" drilling team—came here with the main team after carrying out reservoir exploration work in the Fozi Ridge of the Huai River and the Dahuo House in the Northeast. Team leader Zhu Xiucheng said:
    "The places we go are colder each time, the quality of work required is higher each time, and the things we learn are more each time. Our nineteen members all rush to work when we're on duty, and sing songs cheerfully when we're off duty.
    "At twelve o'clock in the middle of the night, we crawl out of our warm beds and walk two or three miles in the freezing cold to take over the shift. It's indescribably cold! But along the way, the girls still crack jokes: 'We're wearing ice coats and ice hats!' 'There are kittens biting our faces!'"

    昆独仑河的冬天
    本报记者　刘衡
    十二月，包头附近的昆独仑河已是“滴水成冰”的严寒季节。河水冰冻两尺，山野积雪已有数寸。河与山、天与地，白茫茫一片，好像冻结成一个整体。
    就在这零下三、四十度的严寒里，水利部北京地质勘探设计院和包头水利局钻探队的一百多人，为了提供水库的设计资料，日夜不停地进行钻探工作。
    钻探队是九月来的。工人们克服了野外工作的各种困难：没有汽灯，就点着火把、小油灯干活。没有汽车，就打着赤脚下冰水抬机器；供钻探的循环水冻了，就用火烤；柴油机的燃料冻了，就用火烧。工人们说：“任凭你天寒地冻，也冻不了我们的机器，我们的心。”十一月份，全队出勤率已达到百分之九十八。郎铭忠所领导的钻探组竟接连两月达到出勤率百分之一百。
    新中国第一个女子钻探组——“三八”钻探组在进行了淮河佛子岭、东北大伙房等地的水库勘探工作后，跟着大队来到这里。组长朱秀成说：
    “我们去的地方一次比一次冷，工作质量一次比一次要求得高，我们学到的东西也就一次比一次更多。我们十九人，上班都抢着活干，下班都热热闹闹的唱着歌。
    “半夜十二点钟，我们从热被窝里爬出来，在冰天雪地里走两、三里路去接班。那个冷啊，就没法说！可是，一路上，姑娘们还要说笑话：‘咱们穿上冰衣、戴上冰帽啦！’‘咱脸上啊，有小猫在咬！’”
