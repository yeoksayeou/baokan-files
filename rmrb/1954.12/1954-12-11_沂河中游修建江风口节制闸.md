    Jiangfengkou Sluice Gate Being Built in the Middle Reaches of the Yi River

    A reinforced concrete sluice gate is under construction in Jiangfengkou on the Yi River in southern Shandong Province. The purpose of building the gate is to control the flow of the Yi River into the Wu River, in order to avoid flooding along the banks of the Wu River. The Jiangfengkou Sluice Gate is 84 meters long, 6 meters high, and has 7 openings. The entire project requires excavating nearly one million cubic meters of earth and stone, and pouring more than ten thousand cubic meters of concrete. The project started on November 1, and by November 25, more than 255,000 cubic meters of earthwork had been completed. It is expected that the entire project will be completed before the flood season comes in June next year.

    In the past, a stone dam was built in Jiangfengkou to control the flow of the Yi River from Jiangfengkou into the Wu River. After the stone dam was destroyed by the Japanese invaders in 1939, the flow of the Yi River into the Wu River was out of control. The Wu River itself can only accommodate 500 cubic meters per second of floodwater, but the floodwater diverted from the Yi River is often more than 1,500 cubic meters per second, and sometimes even reaches 2,000 to 3,000 cubic meters per second, causing the Wu River to flood. After the completion of the Jiangfengkou control project, these areas can be basically free from flooding under normal rainfall conditions.

### 沂河中游修建江风口节制闸

    沂河中游修建江风口节制闸
    山东省南部沂河上的江风口地方正在修建一座钢筋混凝土的节制闸。建闸的目的是要控制沂河流入武河的流量，以避免武河沿岸的泛滥。江风口节制闸长八十四公尺、高六公尺、有七孔。整个工程需开挖土石方近百万公方，要浇筑混凝土一万多公方。这个工程于十一月一日动工，到十一月二十五日止，已经完成了土方二十五万五千多公方。预计到明年六月汛期来到前，全部工程就可完工。
    过去江风口地方曾筑有石坝，以节制沂河由江风口分入武河的流量。一九三九年石坝被日寇破坏后，沂河分入武河的流量就失去了控制。武河本身只能容纳五百秒公方的洪水，而从沂河分入的洪水往往在一千五百秒公方以上，有时竟达两三千秒公方，引起武河泛滥。江风口控制工程完成后，这些地区在常年雨量下可以基本上免除水灾。
