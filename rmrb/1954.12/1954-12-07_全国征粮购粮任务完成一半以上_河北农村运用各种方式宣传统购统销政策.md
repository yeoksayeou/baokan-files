Xinhua News Agency, December 6th:

The public grain requisition and unified grain purchase and sale work in the major grain-producing areas across the country has largely progressed to the township level by the end of November. This year's unified grain purchase and sale operation is very large in scale, with several million cadres dispatched by local Party committees and governments at all levels. It is expected that this work will be basically completed nationwide by the end of December. According to statistics from the Ministry of Food from July 1st to November 20th, the national public grain requisition and grain unified purchase tasks have been completed by 51.9%. Among them, Central South region has made faster progress, completing 69.45% of the task; Northwest completed 65.9%; Southwest and East China completed 57.68% and 55.17% respectively; Northeast and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region completed more than 20% to 23%. In provinces that started this work earlier, farmers are delivering grain to warehouses in large quantities. A few provinces, such as Sichuan, can basically complete the warehousing work before early December. The unified purchase work in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the northeastern provinces can be completed in January next year due to the later harvest. In the grain unified purchase work, provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, and Hunan have begun issuing grain purchase certificates to grain-deficient households in rural areas.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Baoding: Rural areas in Hebei Province are emphasizing policy publicity during the unified purchase and sale.

After the meetings of county, district, and township level cadres in various parts of Hebei Province, meetings of Communist Party members and activists were generally held, and publicity backbones were trained at the township level. Incomplete statistics from Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, and Cangxian alone show that more than 250,000 publicity backbones were trained. The Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Hebei Provincial People's Government has also organized 76 film teams to conduct mobile screenings in rural areas. More than 500 cultural centers and stations held photo exhibitions and lectures on the unified purchase and sale policy. The provincial propaganda departments have printed more than 900,000 copies of speaking materials and singing materials for rural propagandists and amateur opera troupes. At present, this vigorous propaganda campaign has been widely launched in rural Hebei. In order to ensure that everyone knows the policy, Communist Party members and propagandists in rural Hebei Province have made full use of blackboard newspapers, rooftop broadcasts, small-scale forums, individual chats, and other methods to guide farmers to recall, compare, and calculate accounts through vivid and specific examples and the masses' own experiences, so as to inspire their political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm and make farmers further realize the important significance of selling surplus grain to the state. The Party organization of Jinjialing Village in Ninghe County conducted education on the worker-peasant alliance for farmers through the fact that the state's electric water pumping irrigation station and tractors helped them increase production, enabling farmers to understand the relationship between individuals and the state. Fifty-nine farmer households in the village decided to sell 450,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. When the propagandist in Jiaozhuang, Gaocheng County, talked about the tragic scenes of the famine in 1943, many people cried. The farmers said that no one cared about the disaster in the old society, but now we have a good life with the People's Government, and we can't ignore other places that are suffering. They loaded the surplus grain and cotton they sold onto more than 20 carts and collectively sent them to the state warehouse.

Now the autumn requisition and unified purchase and sale of grain, cotton, and oil crops have been fully launched throughout the province. As of November 20, farmers in the three special districts of Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Tongxian had delivered more than 560 million jin of grain for tax and sale, and the province had received 460 million jin of seed cotton and more than 250 million jin of oil crops.

    全国征粮购粮任务完成一半以上
    河北农村运用各种方式宣传统购统销政策
    【新华社六日讯】　到十一月底止，全国各产粮地区公粮征收和粮食统购统销工作绝大部分已进展到乡。今年粮食统购统销工作的规模很大，中共各地党委和各级政府派出的干部有几百万人。预计到十二月底止，这个工作在全国范围内就可基本结束。据粮食部自七月一日到十一月二十日止的统计，全国公粮征收和粮食统购任务已完成百分之五十一点九。其中中南进展较快，完成任务百分之六十九点四五，西北完成百分之六十五点九，西南和华东分别完成百分之五十七点六八和五十五点一七，东北和内蒙古自治区完成百分之二十到百分之二十三以上。这个工作开展较早的省份，农民正大量送粮入库。四川等少数省十二月上旬以前可基本结束入库工作。内蒙古自治区和东北各省因为收获较晚，统购工作在明年一月可以结束。在粮食统购工作中，河北、山东、湖南等省对农村缺粮户已开始发给购粮证。
    据新华社保定讯：河北省各地农村在统购统销中重视政策宣传。
    河北省各地县、区、乡三级干部会议结束后，普遍召开了共产党员和积极分子会议，并以乡为单位训练了宣传骨干。仅据张家口、唐山、沧县三个专区不完整的统计，就训练宣传骨干二十五万多人。河北省人民政府文化事务管理局还组织了七十六个电影队在农村进行巡回演出。五百多处文化馆、站举行了图片展览和统购统销政策讲座。省级宣传部门已为农村宣传员、业余剧团印发了九十多万份讲话材料和演唱材料。目前这一大张旗鼓的宣传运动已在河北农村中广泛展开。为了作到家喻户晓，河北省农村中的共产党员和宣传员都充分利用了黑板报、屋顶广播、小型座谈会、个别漫谈等方式，通过生动具体的事例和群众切身的体会，引导农民回忆、对比、算账启发其政治觉悟和爱国热情，使农民进一步认识把余粮卖给国家的重要意义。中共宁河县靳家堼村的党组织，通过国家电力扬水灌溉站和拖拉机帮助他们增产的事实向农民进行了工农联盟的教育，使农民了解到个人和国家的关系，全村五十九户农民决定把余粮四十五万斤卖给国家。藁城县焦庄当宣传员讲到一九四三年闹灾荒的惨景时，许多人都哭了。农民说，旧社会闹灾没人管，现在有了人民政府咱们过上好日子，别处受灾可不能不管。他们把卖的余粮和棉花，装在二十多辆大车上集体送到国家仓库。
    现在全省秋季征收和粮、棉、油料统购统销工作已全面展开。到十一月二十日，唐山、张家口、通县三个专区的农民缴征和出售入库的粮食已达五亿六千多万斤，全省并已收进籽棉四亿六千万斤和油料二亿五千多万斤。
