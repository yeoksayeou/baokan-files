    Over a Thousand Native Sugar Workshops Start Production in Neijiang Prefecture
    Over a thousand native sugar workshops in Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, have successively started production. Over a hundred thousand tons of sugar syrup and molasses will be successively sent to major sugar factories, to be processed into white sugar to supply various regions.
    Neijiang Prefecture is a major sugar-producing area in the Tuo River basin. Zizhong, Jianyang and other places have five large sugar factories. Most of the raw materials they use for sugar production need to be first pressed into sugar syrup and molasses by sugar workshops. Before the start of the sugar pressing season this year, more than eight hundred sugar workshops under the leadership of supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the prefecture began production preparations in September. Many technicians participated in training classes in turn, learning the general task of the country during the transition period, and learning techniques such as sugarcane pressing and sugar boiling. Many workers in Zizhong, Jianyang and other counties proposed production increase plans. The production equipment of the sugar workshops has also been improved this year. The entire prefecture has added more than one hundred and sixty sets of steel shafts to replace wooden shafts for pressing sugarcane, which can press an additional three thousand kilograms per day, and the sugar extraction rate can also be increased by five percent.

    内江专区千多个土糖坊开工
    四川省内江专区一千多个土糖坊陆续开工生产。上十万吨糖清和糖浆将陆续送往各大糖厂，由各大糖厂制成白糖供应各地。
    内江专区是沱江流域主要产糖区。资中、简阳等地有五个大糖厂。它们用的制糖原料，大部分需要先由糖坊压榨制成糖清和糖浆。今年榨糖季节到来以前，全专区供销合作社领导的八百多个糖坊从九月间就开始进行生产准备工作。不少技术工人轮流参加了训练班，学习国家过渡时期的总任务，学习榨蔗、熬糖等技术。资中、简阳等县不少工人提出了增产计划。糖坊的生产设备今年也有了改进。全专区增加了一百六十多套钢轴，用钢轴代替木轴榨甘蔗，每天可多压三千公斤，出糖率也可以提高百分之五。　（文卉）
