A short commentary:

    To eliminate the phenomenon of embezzlement and theft of state property by state organ personnel, it is necessary to simultaneously wage a serious struggle against bureaucracy in state organs. This is the main lesson from many past embezzlement and theft cases, and also the main lesson from the case of Zhang Guangyi's massive embezzlement and theft of state tax revenue.

    From the course of this incident, it can be seen that Zhang Guangyi's unscrupulous criminal activities of stealing state tax revenue continued for more than a year and a half before being exposed. During this period, there were very obvious loopholes in the work system of the Third Sub-bureau of the Jinan Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau: entrusting Zhang Guangyi to handle the three tasks of issuing invoices, collecting payments, and verifying them was inherently very dangerous; and they arbitrarily changed the "mutual review of three copies" system to "review of one copy," which made it possible for Zhang Guangyi to arbitrarily tamper with the other two copies, making it difficult for him to be discovered. However, the leaders of this sub-bureau seemed to have never considered the possibility of any embezzlement of tax revenue in this link. Even when the masses made multiple reports, they paid no attention at all. Zhang Guangyi's life was very corrupt, and they never thought about where he got the money he used. Under the leadership of such "unconcerned" leaders, state property could not possibly have any guarantee.

    We are very surprised: after the "Three-Anti" struggle in 1952 and the struggle against bureaucracy, commandism, and violations of law and discipline in 1953, why are the leading personnel of this sub-bureau still so numb? Why do they still dare to adopt such a bad attitude of indifference to the reports and struggles of the people? Why are they still so indifferent to state property? Why can't they see such obvious loopholes? Where exactly is the problem? All of these are difficult to answer in the existing materials. We demand that the Jinan Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau, the financial departments, and the Jinan Municipal Procuratorate, supervisory organs, and the Party's Discipline Inspection Commission thoroughly investigate the leadership of this sub-bureau, conduct a thorough study and exposure of the problems in all aspects, and take all necessary steps to change the status quo. Otherwise, if this one thief is discovered, another thief may still appear. Because this environment is too suitable for thieves to survive.

    深入检查济南市人民政府税务局第三分局的官僚主义作风
    要肃清国家机关工作人员中贪污盗窃国家财产的现象，必须同时对国家机关中的官僚主义进行严重的斗争。这是过去许多贪污盗窃事件给我们的主要教训，也是这次章光益大量贪污盗窃国家税款事件给我们的主要教训。
    从这一事件的经过情形中可以看到：章光益肆无忌惮地盗窃国家税款的罪恶活动，到揭露时止，已经干了一年半还多。这中间，济南市人民政府税务局第三分局的工作制度上存在着十分明显的漏洞：开票、收款和核对三项工作交给章光益一个人包办，本来就是十分危险的；而他们又擅自把“互审三联”的制度改成“审核一联”，这就使得章光益可以在其他二联上任意捣鬼，很难被人发觉。但这个分局的领导者们似乎从来就没有考虑过这个环节上有发生任何贪污税款事件的可能。甚至有群众多次检举，他们也完全不加注意。章光益的生活很腐化，他们也完全不去想想他用的钱是那里来的。在这样一些“无所用心”的领导者们领导之下，国家的财产当然不可能有任何的保障。
    我们很奇怪：经过一九五二年的“三反”斗争和一九五三年反对官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪的斗争，这个分局的领导人员为什么还是这样麻木不仁？他们为什么对人民群众的检举斗争还敢采取这样恶劣的漠视态度？他们对国家的财产为什么还敢这样漠不关心？他们为什么对这样明显的漏洞会完全看不见？问题究竟在那里？所有这些，都很难在现有的材料中得到答案。我们要求济南市人民政府税务局、财政部门和济南市的检察机关、监察机关、党的纪律检查委员会彻底检查一下这个分局的领导，把各方面的问题作一次彻底的研究和揭露，并采取一切必要的步骤来改变现状。否则这一个盗贼被发现了，另一个盗贼仍然有可能出现。因为这个环境太适宜于盗贼们生存了。
