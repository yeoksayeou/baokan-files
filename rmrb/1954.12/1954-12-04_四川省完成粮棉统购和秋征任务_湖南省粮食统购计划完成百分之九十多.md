    Sichuan Province has victoriously completed the unified purchase of grain and cotton and the autumn agricultural tax collection. Jiangjin, Yibin, Luzhou, Suining, Nanchong, Neijiang and other special districts have overfulfilled their tasks. As of November 30th, all of the unified purchased rice in the province has been stored in warehouses, and the amount of cotton purchased has reached more than 120% of the annual plan.
    In the work of unified grain and cotton purchase and the collection of agricultural tax, under the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, a series of cadre meetings were held to specifically explain the policies and working methods. Among the broad masses of farmers, in conjunction with summarizing the benefits of the bumper harvest and the unified purchase and sales system, socialist education was further conducted to farmers in various places. The farmers of Xipu Township in Pixian County, through summarizing the fact that tractor-tilled land increased production by 16%, joyfully sold 2.4 million catties of surplus grain to support national industrial construction. The farmers of He Deng Township in the cooperative New Fan County, in order to support disaster areas and liberate Taiwan, quickly dried and cleaned all 1.48 million catties of rice and 2.2 million catties of yellow millet collected through taxation and unified purchase and sent them to the national granaries. Cotton farmers in Suining Special District enthusiastically sold cotton. The original plan was to purchase 230,000 dan of cotton in the entire special district, but by early November, 280,000 dan had already been purchased.
    Now, grain departments at all levels are strengthening grain storage management. Jiangjin Special District has organized 800 cadres to conduct a general survey of the grain stored in various granaries. (Our Sichuan Reporter Station)
    As of November 20th, the amount of grain stored in Hunan Province under the unified purchase plan has reached more than 90% of the unified purchase plan; Shaoyang Special District has overfulfilled the unified purchase and storage task.
    This year, the lake area of Hunan Province suffered from floods, and the farmers in the vast mountainous and hilly areas responded to the call of the Party and the government to increase production beyond the plan, and they have achieved a bumper harvest. In order to support national industrial construction, liberate Taiwan, and support the people in disaster areas, they enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state. Farmers in Ping Tian Township, Tenth District, Wangcheng County, sent more than 170,000 catties of surplus grain purchased under the unified plan to the national granaries in one day. Eighty-one agricultural production cooperatives in Liling County took the lead in selling more than 840,000 catties of surplus grain to the state, an increase of 88.6% compared to last year; twenty-eight agricultural production cooperatives in Hengshan County sold more than 455,000 catties of surplus grain to the state after the autumn harvest, all of which promoted the development of grain purchase work in the local area.
    In the work of unified grain purchase, education on the general task of the state during the transition period was further conducted among farmers in various places, and the socialist consciousness of farmers was further enhanced, and new development was seen in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations. During the period of unified grain purchase, four counties in Hengyang Special District, including Hengyang and Yongming, developed 569 new mutual aid teams, and another 648 temporary mutual aid teams were upgraded to permanent mutual aid teams; 159 new agricultural production cooperatives were established in the entire special district during this period. During the period of unified grain purchase, Changsha County in Xiangtan Special District established 47 new agricultural production cooperatives, and developed and rectified a large number of mutual aid teams. During this period, a winter production campaign was also enthusiastically launched in various places. According to incomplete statistics, by mid-November, more than 9 million mu of winter crops had been rush-planted in the province, of which farmers in Hengyang Special District had planted more than 1.27 million mu.

    湖南省粮食统购计划完成百分之九十多
    四川省粮食、棉花的统购任务和农业税秋征任务已经胜利完成。江津、宜宾、泸州、遂宁、南充、内江等专区都超额完成了任务。到十一月三十日，全省统购的大米已经全部入仓，棉花收购数量达到年计划百分之一百二十以上。
    在粮棉统购和征收公粮的工作中，各地在党委统一领导下，召开了一系列的干部会议，具体交代了政策和工作方法。在广大农民中间，结合总结丰收和统购统销的好处，各地进一步向农民进行了社会主义教育。郫县犀浦乡农民通过总结拖拉机代耕地增产百分之十六的事实，欢欣鼓舞地卖出余粮二百四十万斤，支援国家工业建设。合作化了的新繁县禾登乡的农民，为了支援灾区，支援解放台湾，很快就把征收和统购的一百四十八万斤大米、二百二十万斤黄谷全部风晒干净，送入国家粮仓。遂宁专区棉农们踊跃出售棉花，全专区原来计划收购二十三万担棉花，到十一月上旬，已经收购了二十八万担。
    现在各地粮食部门正在加强粮食保管工作。江津专区已经组织了八百名干部，对各粮仓的存粮进行普查。　（本报四川记者站）
    到十一月二十日止，湖南省统购粮食入库数量已经达到统购计划的百分之九十以上；邵阳专区已经超额完成了统购入库任务。
    湖南省滨湖地区今年遭受了水灾，广大山区、丘陵地带的农民响应了党和政府超额增产的号召，获得丰收。他们为了支援国家工业建设、支援解放台湾和支援灾区人民，踊跃地把余粮卖给国家。望城县第十区坪田乡农民一天就把统购的十七万多斤余粮送入国家粮库。醴陵县八十一个农业生产合作社带头卖给国家八十四万多斤余粮，比去年增加百分之八十八点六；衡山县二十八个农业生产合作社秋后卖给国家四十五万五千多斤余粮，都推动了当地购粮工作的开展。
    在粮食统购工作中，各地向农民进一步进行了关于国家过渡时期总任务的教育，农民社会主义觉悟更加提高，农业生产互助合作组织有了新的发展。衡阳专区的衡阳、永明等四个县在统购粮食的期间，新发展了五百六十九个互助组，另外有六百四十八个临时互助组提高为常年互助组；全专区在这个期间新建立的农业生产合作社，有一百五十九个。湘潭专区的长沙县在统购粮食的期间新办了四十七个农业生产合作社，并发展、整顿了大批互助组。这个期间，各地也热烈地掀起了冬季生产运动。据不完全的统计，到十一月中旬，全省已经抢种冬季作物九百多万亩，其中衡阳专区农民就种了一百二十七万多亩。
