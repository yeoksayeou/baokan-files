    Liang Xi, Chairman of the National Association for Science and Technology Popularization, issued a statement denouncing the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The statement is as follows:
    Disregarding the repeated warnings from the Chinese people and peace-loving people around the world, US imperialism has brazenly signed a so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. I, on behalf of all members of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, express my extreme indignation and resolutely oppose this war treaty aimed at invading our territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands and preparing for new wars of aggression.
    We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," and we will certainly support with all our strength the struggle of our government and the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan.
    People all over the world can see very clearly that the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is a thorough and complete treaty of aggression. The US aggressive clique is arrogantly trying to use this treaty to occupy our territory of Taiwan indefinitely and infringe upon our sovereignty. But this treaty is illegal and completely invalid. The US aggressive clique should not dream of unilaterally tearing up international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Japanese Instrument of Surrender.
    Liberating Taiwan is the glorious historical task of the Chinese people. The people of the whole country are facing this great task, and they must unite more closely and strengthen their work in all aspects, contributing all their strength to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan. All members of the Science and Technology Popularization Association are prepared to respond to the government's call at any time and actively participate in the work of liberating Taiwan. Taiwan is our sacred territory, and the 600 million people of China must liberate Taiwan. The illegal US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" cannot save Chiang Kai-shek's inevitable fate of failure, nor can it stop the victory of the Chinese people's sacred cause of liberating Taiwan.

    坚决反对美蒋条约坚决解放台湾
    全国科学技术普及协会主席梁希发表谈话
    中华全国科学技术普及协会主席梁希发表谈话，斥责美蒋“共同防御条约”。谈话如下：
    美帝国主义不顾中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的屡次警告，竟悍然和蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”。我代表中华全国科学技术普及协会全体会员，以极愤怒的心情，坚决反对这个以侵略我国领土台湾和澎湖列岛并准备新的侵略战争为目的的战争条约。
    我们完全拥护周恩来外长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，我们一定以全力支持我国政府和人民解放军解放台湾的斗争。
    全世界人民都看得很清楚，美蒋“共同防御条约”是一个彻头彻尾的侵略条约。美国侵略集团狂妄地想利用这个条约来无限期霸占我国领土台湾，侵犯我国主权。可是这一个条约是非法的，是完全无效的。美国侵略集团休想片面撕毁开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和日本投降条款等国际协议。
    解放台湾是中国人民光荣的历史任务，全国人民面临着这个伟大的任务，一定要更加紧密地团结一致，从各方面加强工作，贡献一切力量来支援解放台湾的斗争。科学技术普及协会全体会员准备随时响应政府号召，积极参加解放台湾的工作。台湾是我国的神圣领土，全中国六亿人民一定要解放台湾，非法的美蒋“共同防御条约”是挽救不了蒋贼必然失败的命运的，也阻止不了中国人民解放台湾的神圣事业的胜利。（新华社）
