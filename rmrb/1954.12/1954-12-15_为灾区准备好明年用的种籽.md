    Prepare seeds for disaster areas for next year
    Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, has prepared 3.12 million catties of early rice seeds for farmers in the disaster areas for use in developing production next year.
    Before the early rice harvest this year, the Nanchang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party already arranged the work of purchasing early rice seeds from non-disaster areas at a joint meeting of district committee secretaries and district heads. In the process of purchasing early rice seeds, all localities paid attention to checking purity, checking germination, and checking the degree of dryness. The county agricultural technology guidance station dispatched seven cadres to assist in the inspection. The early rice seeds purchased by various localities this year are generally pure, full, and insect-free.
    These seeds have now been stored separately and are being kept by special personnel.

    为灾区准备好明年用的种籽
    江西省南昌县已经为灾区农民准备好了三百一十二万斤早稻种籽，供明年用来发展生产。
    在今年收割早稻以前，中共南昌县委就在区委书记、区长联席会上布置了向非灾区收购早稻种籽的工作。在收购早稻种籽的过程中，各地注意进行了查纯度、查芽谷、查干燥程度的工作；县农业技术指导站曾经抽调出七名干部协助查验。各地今年收购的早稻种籽，一般都纯净、饱满、无虫。
    这些种籽，现在都已经分别储存，并有专人负责保管。
