Solving the Drinking Water Problem for People in Mountainous Areas

    More than twenty counties in Hebei Province are mountainous areas, lacking water sources. It is very difficult to dig wells underground, and the people have great difficulty in obtaining drinking water, having to travel three, five, or even twenty *li* to fetch water, wasting a lot of manpower and time.

    In order to improve mountain production and improve the lives of people in mountainous areas, the state has been using methods such as building cisterns and water cellars to store rainwater or using bamboo pipes and tile pipes to divert spring water to solve the problem of drinking water for the masses since 1951. By 1953, the drinking water problem for more than 93,000 people had been solved. This year, the state used a portion of the old liberated area relief grain and water conservancy investment funds to build 747 water pools, water cellars, and water diversion pipes, solving the drinking water problem for more than 72,000 people. There are still approximately 240,000 people in the province with drinking water difficulties, and it is planned to solve all of these problems by 1957. (Ren Jie, Yue Zhongren)

    解决山区群众饮水问题
    河北省有二十多个县的山区，缺乏水源，地下很难凿井，群众饮水非常困难，要到三里五里以至二十里以外的地方取水，浪费了很多的人力和时间。
    国家为了提高山区生产，改善山区人民生活，从一九五一年开始，用修水池、水窖储存雨水或用竹管、瓦管引泉水等方法解决群众饮水问题。到一九五三年，共解决了九万三千多人的饮水问题。今年国家又用一部分老区救济粮和水利投资款，修建了七百四十七处水池、水窖和引水管等工程，解决了七万二千多人的饮水问题。现全省尚有约二十四万多人饮水有困难，计划到一九五七年将全部获得解决。　（任　杰、岳仲仁）
