Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 14th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech at a public gathering in Lucknow on the 12th. He said, "I am very happy to say that our relationship with China is getting closer and closer." Nehru said, "India is eager to strengthen its relations with China. The two countries share a common border of nearly two thousand miles. The two countries have maintained cultural relations for more than two thousand years and have never had a war." He also said that on the basis of mutual non-interference in internal affairs and mutual recognition of sovereignty, there is a wide scope for mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries.

Nehru pointed out that the joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India in Delhi was a major historical event. He said that if all countries recognize the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, then the current fear, suspicion, and distrust will be replaced by better and healthier relations.

Referring to his recent visit to China, Nehru said that China is a big country. After forty years of strife and civil war, China now has a stable central government. This is not a matter of opinion, but a matter of fact. Therefore, he was surprised when some people and countries were debating whether to recognize China or whether to accept China as a member of the United Nations. He said it was strange that people were debating whether something that already exists actually exists. How can people close their eyes to living facts?

Referring to his upcoming visit to Indonesia and the five-nation prime ministers' conference to consider the issue of convening an Asian-African conference, Nehru said that Asia has awakened today. "We cannot tolerate Asian affairs being resolved by non-Asian countries. Although, I do admit, these other countries can express concern for Asian countries."

Nehru also said that India hopes to establish friendly relations with all countries in the world and is particularly concerned with maintaining friendly relations with its neighbors.

    尼赫鲁发表演说希望进一步加强中印关系
    【新华社新德里十四日电】印度总理尼赫鲁十二日在勒克瑙一个公众集会上发表演说。他说：“我很高兴地说，我们和中国的关系是越来越亲密了。”尼赫鲁说：“印度渴望加强和中国的关系。印度和中国有着将近两千英里的共同边界。两国有保持了两千多年的文化关系而从来没有发生过一次战争的历史记录。”他又说：在互不干涉内政和互相承认主权的情况下，两国之间是有广泛的范围来进行互利的合作的。
    尼赫鲁指出，中印两国总理在德里发表的联合声明是历史上的重大事件。他说，如果所有国家都承认和平共处的五项原则，那么目前的恐惧、疑虑和互不信任就会为较好的、较健全的关系所代替。
    尼赫鲁在提到他最近到中国的访问时说，中国是一个大国。中国在经过四十年的纷争和内战以后，已有了一个稳固的中央政府。这不是看法问题，而是事实问题。因此，当一些人们和国家在辩论是否要承认中国或者是否要接受中国作为联合国会员国这个问题的时候，他就感到很惊奇。他说人们竟然在辩论着一件已经存在的事物究竟是否存在，这是很奇怪的。人们如何能够对活生生的事实闭着眼睛不看呢？
    他在提到他即将访问印度尼西亚以及将要考虑召开亚非国家会议问题的五国总理会议时说，亚洲今天已经觉醒了。“我们不能容忍亚洲的事务由非亚洲的国家来解决。虽然，我的确承认，这些其他的国家可以对亚洲国家表示关心。”
    尼赫鲁还说，印度希望和世界所有国家建立友好关系，并特别关心和它的邻邦维持友好关系。
