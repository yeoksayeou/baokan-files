Comrade Chairman, Comrades!

The government of the Romanian People's Republic warmly welcomes the Soviet government's proposal to convene a conference of European nations to discuss issues of paramount importance to the peoples of Europe regarding the guarantee of peace and security in Europe. The peoples of Europe are deeply concerned with establishing and guaranteeing conditions that can ensure lasting peace in Europe and the world.

Expressing the will of the Romanian people, the government of the Romanian People's Republic is guided in its foreign policy by a commitment to international cooperation with all countries. The government of the Romanian People's Republic adheres to a consistent position of defending peace, opposing the establishment of military blocs aimed at enslaving other countries and dividing the world, because historical experience proves that the establishment of such military blocs will ultimately lead to wars with all their fatal consequences.

People's Democratic Romania is engaged in construction to ensure the continuous improvement of the material and cultural life of the Romanian people, and therefore, there can be no other policy than implementing a policy of safeguarding peace and national independence – the guarantee of the peaceful labor of the Romanian people.

This is why the Romanian People's Republic, together with other peace-loving countries led by the Soviet Union, is actively taking measures to maintain and consolidate peace.

The government of the Romanian People's Republic has repeatedly opposed the aggressive bloc of the United States, Britain, and France, as well as the policy pursued by German revanchist militarists to rebuild the German "Bundeswehr" and revive German imperialism.

The government of the Romanian People's Republic agrees with the Soviet government that the Paris Agreements, signed on October 23 this year, which stipulate the remilitarization of West Germany and its inclusion in military blocs in the form of the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Group (whose aggressive aims cannot be concealed), have created a grave danger in Europe threatening European peace and security.

Long historical experience has convinced the Romanian people that as long as German militarism exists in Europe, the Romanian people and the peoples of other European countries who have suffered twice from German imperialist aggression and plunder will not have tranquility and security.

The victory over Hitlerism has already established the preconditions for eliminating German militarism and the disasters it brought to the peoples of Europe.

The major powers that joined the anti-Hitler coalition undertook in the Potsdam Agreement the obligation not to allow the revival of German militarism and to establish a democratic and peaceful Germany, as well as to prevent a new world war, which is in accordance with the will of the peoples of all countries who shed blood and sacrificed themselves to liberate themselves from Hitler's oppression.

Now, only nine years after the surrender of the Hitlerite aggressors, the Romanian people and the peoples of other European countries are once again faced with the danger of the remilitarization of West Germany and its inclusion in military aggressive blocs.

This situation has arisen because the leaders of the United States, primarily with the support of the British and French governments, are willing to violate their international obligations to resolve the German question in a democratic manner, and are implementing a policy of establishing aggressive blocs in Europe, worsening the international situation, and deepening the danger of a new war.

The Soviet Union is the only major power that has undertaken obligations on the German question and has adhered to these obligations.

The Soviet Union has steadfastly pursued a policy of preventing the revival of German fascism, and a policy of restoring German unity on a democratic and peaceful basis.

Instead of promoting the establishment of a democratic and peaceful Germany, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have for years been taking measures to obstruct the realization of this goal, and are plotting to revive West Germany's aggressive militarism.

The failure of the plan to establish the so-called "European Defense Community" proves how much this policy violates the national interests of European countries, and how unpopular this policy is among the extremely broad masses of people in European countries, who have actively launched a victorious struggle against the ratification of the Bonn and Paris Treaties.

However, the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France, regardless of the failures they have suffered in these conspiracies, continue to pursue their aggressive policies, attempting to launch new military adventures.

This policy is particularly embodied in the London and Paris Agreements, through which the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have decided to remilitarize West Germany, which poses a particularly serious threat to the security and national independence of the peoples of European countries, as well as to world peace.

As everyone knows, according to the Paris Agreements, West Germany will begin to have an army of more than 500,000 people, commanded by those Hitler's generals who once commanded troops to occupy the territories of many European countries and were guilty of numerous bloody crimes.

According to the intentions of those who drafted the plan to rearm West Germany, this army should become the most powerful army in Western Europe.

Even the American "New York Times" of November 10 this year stated that "if the Paris Agreements are fully ratified and implemented, Bonn will become the military leader of Western Europe."

The Romanian government believes that rearming West Germany and dragging it into military alliances and blocs such as the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Group is a serious threat to the peace and security of the Romanian people.

In the short span of about twenty years, the Romanian people have twice suffered the disasters brought about by German militarism, shed a lot of blood, and suffered enormous losses to the national economy.

In the First World War (before which some mutually opposing military blocs were also organized), the war and the German occupation caused losses to the national economy of 31 billion gold lei.

One-tenth of the country's population sacrificed themselves on the battlefield.

In the Second World War, due to the betrayal of the Romanian bourgeoisie, Romania was drawn into the embrace of Hitlerite Germany, resulting in the cruel exploitation and plunder of our national economy.

The losses caused by Hitler's oppression amounted to 10 trillion lei, which is equivalent to Romania's budget expenses for twelve years.

The sacrifices that greatly weakened the Romanian people and the significant losses suffered by Romania seriously hindered Romania's economic prosperity and cultural development.

Having suffered the enslavement of the German Emperor's troops during the First World War, and later the oppression and plunder of Hitlerite Germany (until August 23, 1944, when they turned their guns against Hitlerite Germany), the Romanian people believe that German militarism is the mortal enemy of their national independence, freedom, and the progress of their motherland.

The new democratic and peaceful Romania was born in battle, and the Romanian people, liberated by the Soviet army, paid countless sacrifices in this battle to gain freedom and national independence, to get rid of the shackles of imperialism and Hitler's occupation.

The Romanian people have learned from their own historical experience, and they express their determination to resolutely fight against the revival of German militarism and against dragging West Germany into military aggressive blocs.

Under the new situation in Europe caused by the signing of the Paris Agreements, and under the measures taken by the United States, Britain, and France in collusion with German militarists to quickly ratify the Paris Agreements, European countries face two paths. One path is to ratify the Paris Agreements. There is no doubt that this will inevitably aggravate international tensions and increase the danger of a new war. Of course, no country that hopes to defend its security and independence can indifferently watch the increasing expansion of the German "Bundeswehr," watching the habitual thieves of Europe hold more and more tools of slaughter. Therefore, we say that the path of ratifying the Paris Agreements leads to the expansion of armaments, which also means increasing the burden on the shoulders of the peoples of European countries. This path also makes it impossible for the basic conditions necessary for the establishment of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany to exist, and will eventually lead to a new war.

The Soviet Union's proposal on establishing a European collective security system opens up another path for the peoples of European countries. This is the path of maintaining peace and protecting the national independence of all countries, and resolving all outstanding issues through peaceful means.

It is very clear that establishing a European collective security system in which all European countries, regardless of their social system, can participate can prevent the establishment of military blocs and eliminate the root causes of international tensions.

At the same time, the Soviet Union's proposal on establishing a European collective security system makes the revival of German militarism impossible, which is an important step forward on the road to restoring German national unity.

Restoring German unity will give all hard-working German people the opportunity to contribute to the peace and progress of Europe and the world, and enable Germany to play an important role among the European countries.

It is precisely for this reason that the peoples of Europe warmly support the Soviet Union's proposal. And it is precisely for this reason that the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France are concealing the real reasons for their rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal, are not participating in the establishment of a European collective security system, and are not holding this conference with other European countries.

One of the excuses put forward by the ruling groups of Western countries for not wanting to participate in the European conference of states guaranteeing European peace and security is that they did not have enough time to prepare for the discussion of such important issues.

However, everyone knows that Western countries knew about the Soviet Union's proposal on establishing a European collective security system as early as the Berlin Conference, that is, more than nine months ago.

Millions of peace-loving people in Europe have every right to ask: Aren't nine months enough for Western countries to prepare to discuss the issue of organizing a European collective security system? And how is it that the leaders of these countries were able to prepare and finally reach an agreement on the London Agreements in a total of only three weeks after the collapse of the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty? Perhaps the leaders of Western countries have one time scale when talking about collective security, and another time scale when talking about rearming West Germany?

There is no doubt that the European people, who have experienced many tests, will not be deceived by this trick, and will continue to fight for peace and security with greater strength.

The Romanian government fully supports the Soviet Union's proposal on concluding an all-European treaty, which all European countries, regardless of their social system and national system, can participate in, and which takes into account the legitimate interests of all countries, large and small.

The Romanian public welcomes the Soviet Union's proposal with extreme satisfaction and expresses its warm support for this proposal.

Based on past experience, Romania is fully aware of the evil consequences of the policy of establishing European aggressive alliances and blocs, which aim to spread hatred among the peoples of various countries, sacrifice certain countries, turn the spearhead of German aggression eastward, and target the Soviet Union.

In order to hinder the realization of the collective security system proposed by the Soviet Union during this period, the advocates of the bloc policy put forward a series of unilateral guarantees, which Britain and France had also made to Romania on the eve of the Second World War. As the development of events at that time proved, these guarantees actually encouraged German imperialism to realize its conspiracy to enslave the countries of Eastern Europe without any hindrance.

In 1939, representatives of the British government held talks with representatives of Hitler in London, during which Britain guaranteed full respect for the so-called "German sphere of interests" in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, abandoning the guarantees made to Romania and other countries in Eastern Europe, and forced France to sever relations with these countries.

The German-Romanian economic agreement signed after these agreements were reached in 1939 placed Romania's national economy under the control of German monopoly capital. According to this agreement, which had a truly colonial exploitative nature, Romania became an agricultural appendage, becoming a supplier of raw materials, oil, and grain needed by German militarism to prepare for the Second World War.

As a result of implementing these plans of Western imperialists and the ruling reactionary forces and royalist groups, Romania was drawn into Hitler Germany's so-called "living space." Hitler's "new order" was established in Romania. Hitler's "Bundeswehr" troops entered Romania's territory, Romania completely lost its national independence, and was dragged into the criminal adventure of the anti-Soviet war. Only after the Soviet army liberated Romania and the people's patriotic forces overthrew the fascist dictatorship did Romania get rid of this situation.

As everyone knows, this policy, which runs counter to European collective security, encouraged Hitlerite Germany to launch aggression against the countries of Western and Eastern Europe.

The policy that caused the disaster of the Second World War in the past, that is, the policy that threatens Europe with a new and more tragic war today, is being revived under the guise of the Western European Union, which the European people will not fail to recognize.

Of course, if the ruling groups of Western European countries, disregarding the lessons of history and the wishes of the peoples of various countries, embark on ratifying the Paris Agreements in order to revive German militarism and drag it into military aggressive blocs, then peace-loving countries have a responsibility to take resolute measures to safeguard their security and national independence.

The Romanian government fully agrees with the Soviet government's view that, at the present stage, when the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France are colluding with German militarists with revanchist ideas to establish military aggressive blocs on the basis of reviving the German "Bundeswehr," peace-loving countries in Europe can no longer be limited to the methods they previously adopted to ensure their defense. Under the current circumstances, it is necessary not only to be particularly vigilant, but also to jointly take practical and effective measures to defend peace and security. Once the Paris Agreements are ratified, peace-loving countries are required to unite their forces, greatly strengthen their strength, and strengthen their defense forces.

The Romanian government agrees with the view that the current situation requires the countries participating in this conference to take common measures in organizing armed forces and command headquarters, and to take other measures to ensure the peaceful labor of our peoples, ensure the integrity of our national borders, and prevent our borders from being subjected to possible aggression.

The Romanian delegation declares that the Romanian People's Republic is prepared to work with other countries participating in this conference to jointly take all necessary measures.

The Romanian people have endured such enormous suffering and shed so much blood due to the despicable aggression of German imperialists, so they must draw the necessary conclusions when this threat reappears now.

The Romanian people are firmly determined to properly shoulder the responsibilities they bear in the cause of defending peace, defending democratic achievements, and peaceful labor.

The Romanian people, closely united with the people of all peace-loving countries headed by the great Soviet people, look forward to the future with confidence.

The Romanian people are deeply convinced that the policy of the peace-loving countries participating in this conference to guarantee peace and the collective security of all European countries will be widely supported by the peace-loving people of European countries and the world, who resolutely oppose the plan to launch a new world war, and are striving for the complete victory of the noble cause of peace.

### 十二月一日在欧洲会议上  基伏·斯托伊卡的发言

    十二月一日在欧洲会议上
    基伏·斯托伊卡的发言主席同志，同志们！
    罗马尼亚人民共和国政府热烈欢迎苏联政府提出的召开讨论和欧洲人民有极重大关系的保障欧洲和平和安全问题的欧洲国家会议的这个建议。欧洲人民切身地关心着确立和保证能保障欧洲和世界持久和平的条件。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国政府表达着罗马尼亚人民的意志，在它的外交政策中是以致力于同一切国家进行国际合作为指导方针的。罗马尼亚人民共和国政府坚持一贯的保卫和平的立场，反对建立以奴役其他国家为目的的一些军事集团而使世界分裂，因为历史经验证明，建立这种军事集团的结果最后将引导到发生具有一切致命后果的战争。
    人民民主的罗马尼亚正在进行建设以保证不断提高罗马尼亚人民的物质和文化生活，因此，除了实行保卫和平和民族独立的政策——罗马尼亚人民和平劳动的保障以外，不可能有其他政策。
    这就是为什么罗马尼亚人民共和国同以苏联为首的其他爱好和平的国家共同积极地采取维护和巩固和平的措施的缘故。
  罗马尼亚人民共和国政府不止一次地反对美国、英国和法国的侵略集团以及德国复仇的军国主义分子所推行的重建德国“国防军”和复活德国帝国主义的政策。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国政府同意苏联政府的看法：规定使西德重新军国主义化和把西德拖入西欧联盟和北大西洋集团等形式的军事集团（它们的侵略目的是瞒不了人的）的巴黎协定在今年十月二十三日签订后，在欧洲形成了威胁欧洲和平和安全的严重危险。
    长期的历史经验使罗马尼亚人民相信：只要在欧洲存在着德国军国主义，罗马尼亚人民和曾经两次遭受过德国帝国主义侵略和掠夺的欧洲其他各国人民就得不到平静和安全。
    战胜了希特勒主义已经为消灭德国军国主义以及它所带给欧洲人民的灾难建立了先决条件。
    加入反希特勒联盟的各大国在波茨坦协定中承担了不允许德国军国主义复活和建立一个民主的和和平的德国以及制止新的世界大战的义务，这是符合于为从希特勒压迫下解放出来而流血牺牲的各国人民的意志的。
    现在，希特勒侵略者投降后才不过九年，罗马尼亚人民和欧洲其他各国人民就又面临着西德重新军国主义化和西德加入军事侵略集团的危险了。
    这种局势的形成是因为：美国的领导人物，首先是在英法两国政府的支持下，不惜破坏他们所承担的用民主方式解决德国问题的国际义务，而执行在欧洲建立侵略集团、使国际局势恶化和加深新战争危险的政策。
    苏联是各大国中在德国问题上承担了义务而遵守这些义务的唯一的一个国家。
    苏联坚持不渝地奉行阻止德国法西斯主义复活的政策，奉行在民主、和平的基础上恢复德国统一的政策。
    美国、英国和法国政府不但不促进建立一个民主、和平的德国，反而几年来一直在采取措施阻挠实现这一目的，并策划复活西德侵略性的军国主义。
    建立所谓“欧洲防务集团”的计划的失败证明，这种政策是多么违背欧洲各国的民族利益，这种政策在欧洲各国极其广大的人民群众中是多么不得人心，他们曾为反对批准波恩和巴黎条约而积极展开过胜利的斗争。
    但是，美国、英国和法国的统治集团不顾他们在这些阴谋中所遭到的失败，继续奉行他们的侵略政策，力图发动新的军事冒险。
    这种政策特别体现在伦敦和巴黎协定上，美国、英国和法国政府决定通过这些协定来使西德重新军国主义化，这就对欧洲各国人民的安全和民族独立以及对世界和平造成了特别严重的威胁。
    大家知道，根据巴黎协定，西德开始将拥有一支五十多万人的军队，指挥这些军队的是那些曾经指挥军队侵占过欧洲许多国家的领土的血债垒垒的希特勒的将军。
    依照拟订重新武装西德计划的人的意图，这支军队应成为西欧最强大的军队。
    甚至今年十一月十日的美国“纽约时报”也说，“巴黎协定如果被完全批准和付诸实施，就会使波恩成为西欧的军事领导力量。”
    罗马尼亚政府认为，重新武装西德和把它拖入西欧联盟和北大西洋集团这样一类军事联盟和集团，是对罗马尼亚人民的和平和安全的严重威胁。
    罗马尼亚人民在短短二十年左右的时间中曾经两次饱尝德国军国主义带来的灾难，流了不少的鲜血，国民经济遭到了巨大的损失。
    在第一次世界大战（这次战争以前也组织过一些互相对立的军事集团）中，战争和德国的占领使国民经济遭到了三百一十亿金列伊的损失。
    全国居民有十分之一在战场上牺牲了。
    在第二次世界大战中，由于罗马尼亚资产阶级的叛国，罗马尼亚投入了希特勒德国的怀抱，结果使我国国民经济遭到了残酷的剥削和掠夺。
    希特勒压迫所带来的损失达十万亿列伊，这个数目相当于罗马尼亚十二年的预算费用。
    曾使罗马尼亚人民大伤元气的牺牲和罗马尼亚所遭到的重大损失严重地阻碍了罗马尼亚经济的繁荣和文化的发展。
    罗马尼亚人民在第一次世界大战期间遭受过德皇军队的奴役，后来又遭受过希特勒德国的压榨和掠夺（到了一九四四年八月二十三日，他们把枪口掉转过来反对希特勒德国了），所以，他们认为，德国军国主义是自己的民族独立、自由和祖国进步的死敌。
    民主和平的新罗马尼亚是在战斗中诞生的，被苏联军队解放了的罗马尼亚人民在这一次战斗中为取得自由和民族独立、为摆脱帝国主义的枷锁和希特勒的占领而付出了无数牺牲的代价。
    罗马尼亚人民从自己的历史经验中得到了教训，他们表示决心为反对复活德国军国主义和反对把西德拉入军事侵略集团而坚决斗争。
    在因为签订了巴黎协定而造成的欧洲新局势之下，在美国、英国和法国政府勾结德国军国主义者为迅速批准巴黎协定而采取的措施之下，欧洲国家面临着两条道路。一条道路就是批准巴黎协定。毫无疑问，这样就会不可避免地加剧国际紧张局势和使发生新战争的危险增加。当然，任何一个希望保卫自己的安全和独立的国家都不能漠不关心地眼看着德国“国防军”的日益扩充，眼看着欧洲的惯盗手中握有越来越多的屠杀工具。因此我们说，批准巴黎协定的道路导向扩充军备，这也就意味着加重欧洲各国人民肩上的负担。这条道路同时也使得建立统一、和平和民主的德国所必需的基本条件不可能存在，并且终于会造成新的战争。
    苏联提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议为欧洲各国人民打开了另外一条道路。这就是维护和平和保护各国人民的民族独立以及通过和平方式解决一切悬而未决的问题的道路。
    十分明显，建立起一切欧洲国家不分社会制度如何都可以参加的欧洲集体安全体系可以制止建立军事集团，可以消除产生国际紧张局势的根本原因。
    同时，苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议既使德国军国主义的复活成为不可能，那也就是在恢复德国全国统一的道路上迈进的一个重要步骤。
    恢复德国统一将使全体爱好劳动的德国人民有机会对欧洲和全世界的和平和进步作出贡献，并且使德国能够起到它在欧洲国家中应起的一份重要作用。
    正是为了这个缘故，欧洲人民才热烈拥护苏联的建议。而且也正是为了这个缘故，美国、英国和法国的统治集团才隐瞒它们拒绝苏联建议的真正原因，才不参加建立欧洲集体安全体系，才不同欧洲其他国家举行这个会议。
    西方国家统治集团为了掩饰它们不愿参加保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家会议而提出的借口之一是：他们没有足够的时间来准备讨论这样重大的问题。
    但是，大家知道，西方国家早在柏林会议的时候就知道苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议了，那就是说，在九个多月以前就已经知道了这个建议。
    千百万欧洲爱好和平的人民完全有权利问：九个月还不够西方国家准备讨论关于组织欧洲集体安全体系的问题吗？而这些国家的领袖们在所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约垮台以后，总共只用了三个星期就能够准备出伦敦协定并且最后达成了协议，这究竟是怎么一回事呢？大概西方国家的领导人物在谈到集体安全的时候有一个时间的尺度，而在谈到重新武装西德的时候又另外有一个尺度吧？
    毫无疑问：欧洲人民经历过很多考验，决不会受到这种诡计的欺骗，并且将用更大的力量来继续为和平和安全而斗争。
    罗马尼亚政府完全支持苏联关于缔结全欧条约的建议，全欧条约是所有欧洲国家，不问社会制度和国家制度如何都可以参加的，全欧条约并且考虑到一切大小国家的合法利益。
    罗马尼亚公众以极其满意的心情欢迎苏联的建议，并表示热烈支持这项建议。
    罗马尼亚根据过去的经验，完全清楚建立欧洲侵略同盟和集团政策的恶果，这些同盟和集团的目的是在各国人民中散布仇恨，牺牲某些国家，把德国的侵略矛头转向东方，对准苏联。
    集团政策的倡导者们为了阻挠在这个时期实现苏联所建议的集体安全体系，提出了一串片面保证，在第二次世界大战前夕，英国和法国也曾向罗马尼亚提出过这种保证的。正如那个时期事态发展所证明的，这些保证实际上是鼓励了德国帝国主义毫无阻挡地去实现自己奴役东欧各国的阴谋。
    一九三九年，英国政府的代表同希特勒的代表在伦敦举行了会谈，在这次会谈中，英国保证完全尊重在东欧和东南欧的所谓“德国利益范围”，而抛弃了对罗马尼亚及东欧其他国家所作的保证，并强迫法国同这些国家断绝关系。
    在一九三九年达成这些协议之后所签订的德罗经济协定把罗马尼亚的国民经济交给了德国垄断资本支配。根据这一个带有真正殖民地剥削性质的协定，罗马尼亚变成了一个农业附属国，变成了德国军国主义为准备第二次世界大战所需要的原料、石油和粮食的供应国。
    实行西方帝国主义者及当权的反动势力和保皇势力集团的这些计划的结果，罗马尼亚被拉进了希特勒德国的所谓“生存空间”。在罗马尼亚建立了希特勒的“新秩序”。希特勒“国防军”部队开入了罗马尼亚的领土，罗马尼亚国家完全丧失了自己的民族独立，被卷入了反苏战争的罪恶的冒险中。直到苏联军队解放罗马尼亚和人民的爱国力量推翻了法西斯独裁后，罗马尼亚才摆脱了这种处境。
    大家都知道，这种同欧洲集体安全背道而驰的政策鼓励了希特勒德国对西欧和东欧的国家发动侵略。
    过去曾经造成第二次世界大战的灾难的政策，也就是现在使欧洲将遭到更悲惨的新战争的威胁的政策今天又在西欧联盟的幌子下重新复活了，这是欧洲人民不会辨认不清的。
    当然，如果西欧国家统治集团不顾历史教训和各国人民的愿望，为了复活德国军国主义和把它拉入军事侵略集团而着手批准巴黎协定，那么，爱好和平的国家就有责任采取坚决的措施，来保障自己的安全和民族独立。
    罗马尼亚政府完全同意苏联政府的意见：在现阶段，当美国、英国和法国统治集团和有复仇主义思想的德国军国主义者勾结起来，以复活德国“国防军”为基础来建立军事侵略集团的时候，欧洲爱好和平的国家已不能只限于它们以前所采取的保证自己的防御的办法了。在目前情况下，不仅要特别警惕，而且要共同采取保卫和平和安全的实际和有效的措施。巴黎协定一旦被批准，就要求爱好和平的国家团结自己的力量，并且大大加强它们的力量，加强它们的国防力量。
    罗马尼亚政府同意这种看法：目前的局势要求参加这次会议的各国在组织武装部队和司令部方面采取共同的措施，并采取保障我们各国人民的和平劳动、保障我们各国国境的完整以及防备我们的国境遭受可能的侵略的其他措施。
    罗马尼亚代表团声明，罗马尼亚人民共和国准备和参加这次会议的其他国家一起，共同采取一切必要的措施。
    由于德国帝国主义者的可鄙侵略，罗马尼亚人民忍受了多么巨大的苦难，流了多么大量的鲜血，因此，当现在这种威胁重新出现的时候，他们是要作出应有的结论的。
    罗马尼亚人民有坚定的决心要很好地担负起他们在保卫和平事业、保卫民主成果和和平劳动方面所担负的责任。
    罗马尼亚人民和以伟大的苏联人民为首的所有爱好和平的国家的人民紧密地团结在一起，满怀信心地瞻望着将来。
    罗马尼亚人民深信，参加这次保障和平和所有欧洲国家的集体安全的会议的爱好和平各国的政策，会受到欧洲各国和全世界爱好和平的人民的广泛支持，他们坚决反对发动新的世界大战的计划，并且正在争取崇高的和平事业底彻底胜利。
