Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 11th: The National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, political parties, people's organizations, and religious groups issued a communiqué to the people of Vietnam on December 7th, calling on all Vietnamese compatriots who hope for peace and unity in the country to further strengthen unity, consolidate and expand the National United Front, to stop the clutches of the American imperialist warmongers and their lackeys.

The communiqué reviewed the conspiracies of the American imperialists and their agents to undermine peace in Indochina and obstruct the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The communiqué stated: "We should heighten our vigilance and actively struggle against the conspiracies of the American imperialists, the French colonialists who are sabotaging the armistice agreement, and their lackeys—represented by Collins, Ely, and Ngo Dinh Diem. We must prevent them from destroying the peaceful life of our people, prevent them from dividing our beloved motherland, prevent them from infringing upon our national independence and democracy, and prevent them from threatening peace in Southeast Asia and the world."

The communiqué pointed out that peace and unity are currently the sincere desire of every Vietnamese citizen and the most important interests of all the Vietnamese people.

The communiqué stated: "From South to North, in factories, mines, plantations, rice fields, government agencies, schools, residences, and troops, we must further expand our front, unify our actions, and actively support the statement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the memorandum of the Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army. Let us show the determination of our people through practical actions taken in accordance with the tasks of each region:

	Demand that the other party correctly fulfill the Geneva Armistice Agreement and immediately cease actions that violate the agreement;

	Oppose the American imperialists' intervention in Indochina and oppose Collins' war-mongering activities;

	Oppose retaliatory measures against those in South Vietnam who participated in the war of national defense, oppose the terror against people in areas temporarily stationed by French troops, demand that the other party guarantee the democratic rights of the people of South Vietnam, and oppose Ngo Dinh Diem, the lackey of the American imperialists;

	Protest activities aimed at forcing or deceiving the people of North Vietnam to go to South Vietnam."

The communiqué concluded: "Due to the unity of all our people, due to our solidarity in the struggle with the people of Laos, Cambodia, and France, and due to the active support of peace-loving people around the world, we will surely smash all the war-mongering conspiracies of the American imperialists and their lackeys."

The communiqué was signed by: The National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, the Vietnam Socialist Party, the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, the Vietnam Farmers' Union, the Vietnam Women's Union, the Vietnam Youth League, the Vietnam-China Friendship Association, the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association, the Vietnam Association of Literary and Art Workers, the Vietnam Journalists Association, the Liaison Committee of Patriotic Catholics in the Third Interzone (North Vietnam), Buddhist Representative Pham The Long, Cao Dai Unified Church Representative Cao Chao Phat, and Hoa Hao Buddhist Representative Hoang Van Tri.

    反对美帝国主义者在印度支那进行干涉，反对柯林斯的挑拨战争的活动；
    反对对于南越那些曾参加卫国战争的人们采取报复措施，反对对于法军临时驻扎地区中的人们采取恐怖行动，要求对方保证南越人民的民主权利，反对美帝国主义者的走狗吴庭艳；
    抗议目的在于强迫或欺骗北越人民到南越去的活动。”
    文告最后说：“由于我们全体人民的团结，由于我们在斗争中同老挝、柬埔寨和法国三国人民的团结一致，由于世界爱好和平的人民的积极支持，我们一定会粉碎美帝国主义者和他们的走狗的一切挑拨战争的阴谋。”
