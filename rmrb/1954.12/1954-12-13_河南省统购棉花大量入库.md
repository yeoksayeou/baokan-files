Henan Province Massively Stores Unifiedly Purchased Cotton

Cotton purchased in a unified manner from all parts of Henan Province is being massively stored. Currently, the province's daily average purchase of ginned cotton is more than 2.55 million jin. From September to November, the province purchased a total of 118 million jin of ginned cotton, an increase of more than 24% compared to the same period last year. About 40% of the province's pre-purchased cotton has been recovered, and 92% of the pre-purchase deposits have been recovered. In November, cotton ginning workers in various regions widely launched labor competitions, and the amount of seed cotton backlog decreased significantly compared to October. The province's 31,000+ cotton ginning machines gin an average of more than 6 million jin of seed cotton daily, ensuring that a large amount of cotton can be transported to textile factories in a timely manner.

    河南省统购棉花大量入库
    河南省各地统购的棉花正在大量入库，目前全省每天平均收购皮棉二百五十多万斤。从九月到十一月，全省共收购皮棉一亿一千八百万斤，比去年同时期增加百分之二十四以上。全省预购的棉花已经收回百分之四十左右，预购定金已经收回百分之九十二。十一月间，各地轧花工人广泛开展了劳动竞赛，籽棉积压数量比十月份减少很多。全省三万一千多部轧花车每天平均轧籽棉六百多万斤，保证了大量棉花能及时运往纺织工厂。　（姚福年）
