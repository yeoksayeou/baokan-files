On December 8, 1954, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai declared to the world: Historical errors must not be repeated. Only by resisting aggression can we defend peace.

    This is the unwavering determination of the 600 million people of China, an unforgettable lesson learned by those who have suffered countless disasters due to historical errors, and the firm conviction of peace-loving people around the world. The Chinese people are determined to carry the just struggle to liberate Taiwan through to the end; if the American aggressors insist on imposing war on the Chinese people, they will surely be met with unrelenting blows.

    History is not so far in the past. Only thirteen full years have passed since the Pearl Harbor incident on December 8, 1941, and people should still remember it clearly. In those days, the Japanese militarists, with the tacit approval, connivance, and encouragement of some countries, guided the Mukden Incident of 1931 to the Lugouqiao Incident of 1937, and then guided the Lugouqiao Incident to the Pearl Harbor incident. This fiery page of history has long illuminated people's eyes. Do not think that today, with American aggressors replacing Japanese militarists, the Chinese people can be fooled. Do not think that the Chinese people would not allow the Japanese militarists to occupy Mukden in the past, but now they can allow the American aggressors to occupy Taiwan.

    The aggressive nature of the US-Chiang treaty cannot be concealed. The US and British propaganda machines are trying to disguise the treaty's belligerent nature, claiming that the US-Chiang war treaty is intended to "find ways to reduce the dangers in the Far East situation," and portraying the current actions of the United States in promoting war policies and intensifying international tensions around the world as "maintaining peace." What shameless lies! In recent years, the international situation has become tense and uneasy as a result of the US aggressive bloc's desperate pursuit of war policies in Asia, Europe, and around the world. The US aggressive bloc is unwilling to see the international situation ease. After the armistice in Korea and Indochina, the American aggressors hurriedly gathered their vassal states in Europe to conclude the London and Paris Agreements to replace the bankrupt European Army Treaty in order to re-militarize West Germany, continue to obstruct the reunification of Germany, and divide Europe. Is this for peace? In Asia, they planned the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," attempting to undermine the Indochina peace agreement reached at the Geneva Conference and continue to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Is this for peace? The United States is attempting to link the Eastern aggressive system it is planning with the established European aggressive system through a Middle Eastern aggressive system, creating a war encirclement around the world. This is by no means for peace, but to deepen the division of the world, enslave the people of these regions, and prepare for a new world war.

    The United States and its followers are desperately trying to conceal the aggressive and warlike nature of the US-Chiang treaty, insisting that the American armed forces' long-distance voyage to occupy Chinese territory is for so-called "defense." However, as soon as the US-Chiang treaty was signed, the American aggressors more brazenly intensified war activities around the Taiwan Strait. The United States is planning to strengthen its naval and air bases in Taiwan, establish a so-called "Sino-American Military Planning Committee," send additional American armed forces, and use large quantities of military materials, including jet fighters and escort destroyers, to "increase the mobility and offensive power of Chiang Kai-shek's troops." This powerfully proves that the US-Chiang treaty is a vicious step to further endanger our country's security and Asian peace, and everyone who expresses deep concern about the tense situation created by the United States in the Taiwan Strait will never fail to see this fact.

    Clearly, today's American aggressors are repeating the old path of aggression against China and launching a world war that was once taken by the defeated Japanese militarist forces. The world remembers that when the Japanese militarist aggressors created the Mukden Incident and occupied our Northeast, Japanese representative Yosuke Matsuoka, who attended the League of Nations Council, said, "The actions of the Japanese army are entirely an exercise of the right of self-defense"; now Dulles and his ilk also insist that the US-Chiang treaty is "defensive in nature." However, based on historical experience, the Chinese people cannot but believe that this is a new Mukden Incident created by the American aggressors. Similarly, some imperialist countries once attempted to "appease" the Japanese aggressors by sacrificing China's Northeast in an attempt to maintain the "status quo in the Far East." However, the "status quo" could not be maintained, and the Japanese aggressors finally used the Northeast as a base to launch a full-scale war against China, and then launched the Pacific War. Now, the American aggressors are also trying to use Taiwan as a base and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as a tool to prepare for a large-scale offensive against China. In other words, the American aggressors want to go from a new Mukden Incident to a new "Lugouqiao Incident" and to a new world war. In its declaration of war launching the Pacific War, the Japanese militarist forces also clamored to "ensure the permanent peace of East Asia," which is exactly the same as the "enhancing the peace mechanism in the Western Pacific" touted by the current US-Chiang war treaty. Is it accidental that the things done and said by the Japanese militarists of the past and the American aggressors of today are so similar?

    The history of Asia is like this, and the history of Europe is also full of lessons. In 1938, when Hitler ambitiously wanted to occupy Czechoslovakia, the British Chamberlain government at the time, in a ultimatum pressuring Czechoslovakia to submit to the Hitlerite aggressors, said, regardless of right and wrong: If Czechoslovakia refused to submit, then "Czechoslovakia alone shall be responsible for the inevitable war." When condemning Chamberlain's Munich policy of appeasement, Mr. Churchill said: "The British ministers chose dishonor, but in the end, they will still get war." Churchill's words in those days could very well serve as a warning to the cabinet led by Churchill today.

    All these facts prove that infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries, plundering the territory of other countries, and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries is endangering world peace. Sovereignty and territory are inviolable, and national security and the interests of the people must be defended. This is the principle upon which all countries are founded, and this is the purpose of the United Nations Charter. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence repeatedly advocated by the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Myanmar embody this principle and are the criterion for maintaining world peace. The American aggressors' deliberate undermining of this principle and endangering world peace should be resolutely opposed by all peace-loving countries and peoples. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement solemnly declared to the world: "The Chinese people ardently desire peace, but they will never beg for peace at the cost of their own territory and sovereignty. Sacrificing territorial sovereignty can only lead to further aggression and will never lead to true peace. The Chinese people understand that only by resisting aggression can we defend peace." The Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan and oppose American aggression is precisely to defend world peace.

    Some people are trying to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and want to create a "independent Taiwan," "neutralized Taiwan," or "trusteeship" of Taiwan. These proposals are all denying China's sovereignty over Taiwan and are resolutely opposed by the Chinese people. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation" both clearly stipulate that it belongs to China. The so-called "independent Taiwan," "neutralized Taiwan," or "trusteeship" of Taiwan is not only absurd in principle, but also has no basis in law. The Indian "National Herald" commentary on December 3 correctly stated: "Taiwan is an indivisible part of Chinese territory and is recognized by the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. It must be governed by the regime that firmly controls the mainland, and the US-Kuomintang security treaty actually separates it from the main body of China. This treaty has made the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation a scrap of paper and marks open American interference in China's internal affairs." It is very clear that to solve the Taiwan issue, it is necessary to stop the interference of the American aggressive bloc, and it is necessary for all American armed forces to withdraw from our territory of Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait. The United States has no reason to forcibly occupy our territory of Taiwan.

    The Chinese people, steeled in the liberation struggle, will never be intimidated by any war threats. Today's China is no longer the China of the Mukden Incident era; the situation in Europe and Asia today is also very different from the situation before World War II. Historical errors must not be repeated. Acts of aggression must be stopped. If the American aggressors attempt to act arbitrarily and insist on provoking war, then waiting for them will only be relentless and severe punishment.

### 历史的错误不许重演

    历史的错误不许重演
    一九五四年十二月八日中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来向全世界宣告：历史的错误不许重演。只有反抗侵略，才能保卫和平。
    这是全中国六万万人民不可动摇的决心，这是由于历史的错误而受尽无限灾难的人们永不能忘的教训，这是全世界爱好和平人民的坚决主张。中国人民一定要把解放台湾的正义斗争进行到底；美国侵略者如果一定要把战争强加在中国人民头上，他们就一定会受到绝不容情的打击。
    历史过去得并不算远。一九四一年十二月八日珍珠港事变离现在才不过十三整年，人们应该还清楚地记得。当年日本军国主义者在有些国家怎样的默认、纵容和鼓励之下，把一九三一年沈阳事变引导到一九三七年芦沟桥事变，随后又把芦沟桥事变引导到珍珠港事变，这一页烈火般的历史早已照亮了人们的眼睛。不要以为今天是美国侵略者代替了日本军国主义者，就可以蒙混中国人民。不要以为中国人民过去不容许日本军国主义者强占沈阳，现在却可以容许美国侵略者强占台湾。
    美蒋条约的侵略战争性质是不能掩盖的。美英宣传机关力图掩饰这个条约的好战性质，硬说美蒋战争条约是为了“设法减少远东局势的危险性”；把目前美国在世界各地推行战争政策，加剧国际紧张局势的行动，说成是“维持和平”。这是多么无耻的扯谎！近几年来由于美国侵略集团在亚洲、欧洲以及世界各地拼命推行战争政策的结果，才使国际局势紧张不安。美国侵略集团是不愿意看到国际形势缓和的。在朝鲜和印度支那停战之后，美国侵略者便急忙在欧洲纠集仆从国家缔结了伦敦和巴黎协定，来代替已经破产了的欧洲军条约，以便使西德重新军国主义化，继续阻挠德国的统一，分裂欧洲，难道这是为了和平吗？在亚洲，他们策划了“东南亚集体防务条约”，力图破坏日内瓦会议达成的印度支那和平协议，并继续阻碍朝鲜问题的和平解决，难道这是为了和平吗？美国企图把在它策划中的东方侵略体系和已经建立的欧洲侵略体系经过一个中东侵略体系连结起来，造成一道环绕世界的战争包围圈，这决不是为了和平，而是为了加深世界的分裂，奴役这些地区的人民，准备新的世界战争。
    美国和它的追随者们竭力企图掩饰美蒋条约的侵略性质和战争性质，硬把美国武装力量远涉重洋强占中国的领土，说成是为了什么“防御”。可是，美蒋条约一签订，美国侵略者就更加放肆地在台湾海峡周围加强战争活动。美国正在计划加强在台湾的海空军基地，筹设所谓“中美军事计划委员会”，增派美国武装部队，并以大批军事物资包括喷气战斗机和护航驱逐舰，去“增加蒋介石部队的机动性和攻击力量。”这就有力地证明，美蒋条约是进一步危害我国安全和亚洲和平的恶毒步骤，一切对美国在台湾海峡造成紧张局势表示深切关心的人，都决不会看不到这个事实。
    显然的，今天的美国侵略者正在重复着已被打败了的日本军国主义势力侵略中国、发动世界大战的老路。世人都记得，日本军国主义侵略势力制造沈阳事变，侵占我国东北的时候，出席国际联盟理事会的日本代表松冈洋右曾说“日本军队的行动完全是行使自卫权”；现在杜勒斯之流也硬说美蒋条约是“防御性质的”。然而，中国人民根据历史的经验，却不能不认为这是美国侵略者所制造的新的沈阳事变，同样，当年也曾有些帝国主义国家以牺牲中国的东北来“绥靖”日本侵略者，企图借以维持“远东的现状”。然而，“现状”却并没有维持得了，日本侵略势力终于以东北为基地，发动了对中国的全面战争，随后又发动了太平洋战争。现在，美国侵略者也正是要以台湾为基地，以蒋介石卖国集团为工具，来准备对中国的大规模进攻。这也就是说，美国侵略者是要从新的沈阳事变，走向新的“芦沟桥事变”，走向新的世界战争。当年的日本军国主义势力在发动太平洋战争的宣战书中，也曾叫嚷“确保东亚的永久和平”，这同现在的美蒋战争条约所标榜的“增强在西太平洋的和平机构”又是一模一样。当年的日本军国主义者和今天的美国侵略者所做的事和所说的话竟然这样相像，这难道是偶然的么？
    亚洲的历史是如此，欧洲的历史又何尝不是充满了教训？一九三八年当希特勒野心勃勃要侵占捷克斯洛伐克的时候，英国当时的张伯伦政府在压迫捷克斯洛伐克对希特勒侵略者屈服的通牒中，却不分是非地说：如果捷克斯洛伐克拒绝屈服，那么
  “不可避免的战争，应由捷克斯洛伐克单独负责”。邱吉尔先生当年在谴责张伯伦的慕尼黑投降政策时曾说：“英国的大臣们选择了耻辱，但是最后所得的必定仍旧是战争。”当年邱吉尔的这一句话，很可以作为对于今天邱吉尔所领导的内阁的警告。
    这一切的事实证明，侵犯别国主权，掠夺别国领土，干涉别国内政，就是危害世界和平。主权和领土不容侵犯，国家安全和人民利益必须保卫，这是一切国家立国的原则，这是联合国宪章的宗旨。中印两国总理和中缅两国总理所一再倡导的和平共处的五项原则就是这个原则的体现，就是维护世界和平的准则。美国侵略者蓄意破坏这个原则，危害世界和平应该受到一切爱好和平的国家和人民的坚决反对。周恩来外长的声明向全世界郑重宣告：“中国人民热烈地要求和平，但是决不会拿自己的领土和主权作代价乞求和平。牺牲领土主权，只能导致进一步的侵略，决不会得到真正的和平。中国人民懂得，只有反抗侵略，才能保卫和平。”中国人民解放台湾，反对美国侵略的正义斗争，正是保卫世界和平。
    有人企图阻止中国人民解放台湾，要搞什么台湾“独立国”，台湾“中立化”，或“托管”台湾。这些主张都是在否定中国对于台湾的主权，是中国人民所坚决反对的。台湾是中国的领土，“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”都明文规定它是属于中国的。所谓台湾“独立国”，台湾“中立化”或“托管”台湾，不仅在道理上是荒谬的，在法律上也是没有任何根据的。印度“国民先驱报”十二月三日的评论正确地说：“台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分，并且是得到开罗宣言和波茨坦公告的承认的。它必须由稳固地控制着大陆的政权治理，而美国—国民党安全条约实际上把它从中国主体分离开来。这个条约已使开罗宣言和波茨坦公告成为废纸，并且标志着美国公开干涉中国内政。”非常明显，要解决台湾问题，就要制止美国侵略集团的干涉，就要美国一切武装力量从我国领土台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走。美国没有任何理由强占我国领土台湾。
    在解放斗争中百炼成钢的中国人民，决不是任何战争威胁所能吓倒的。今天的中国，已经不是沈阳事变时代的中国了；今天的欧洲和亚洲的局势，也已经大大不同于第二次世界大战以前的局势了。历史的错误不许重演。侵略的行动必须制止。如果美国侵略者妄图一意孤行，硬要挑起战争，那么，等待着它的，就只有无情的、严重的惩罚。
