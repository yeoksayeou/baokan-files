    France Faces an Important Choice
    Gao Ji
    On December 16, the Soviet government presented a note to the French government, stating that if France ratifies the Paris Agreements, the Soviet government would only be able to propose to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR the abrogation of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This presents France with a major choice: Does France want to consolidate Franco-Soviet friendship to guarantee France's security and European peace, or does it want to revive German militarism, which would once again subject France to the threat of aggression and greatly increase the risk of a new war in Europe?

    Therefore, it is clear that the Soviet government's note is an important action by the Soviet Union to resolutely oppose the revival of German militarism and to strive to safeguard European peace.

    The Franco-Soviet Treaty, signed in December 1944, was intended to prevent the possibility of new aggression by German militarism after the war. Article 3 of the treaty stipulates: "The two contracting parties undertake that after the end of the current war against Germany, they will jointly take all necessary measures to eliminate any new threat from Germany and to prevent any action that may lead to new German attempts at aggression." Article 5 of the treaty stipulates: "The two contracting parties undertake not to conclude any alliance against one or the other contracting party or to join any group directed against one or the other contracting party." German militarist forces had twice launched bloody wars of aggression against France in the short period since the 20th century, plunging Europe into terrible, devastating disasters. Therefore, after defeating Nazi Germany at great sacrifice and cost, the alliance formed by France and the Soviet Union in the form of a treaty against German militarism not only served the interests of the peoples of France and the Soviet Union, but also had great significance for guaranteeing European peace.

    Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in his speech at the Moscow meeting commemorating the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Franco-Soviet Treaty, said: "The Franco-Soviet Treaty should be the cornerstone of guaranteeing European peace." This statement profoundly illustrates the importance of the Franco-Soviet Treaty.

    Friendly relations between France and the Soviet Union are of particular importance to France. General de Gaulle, who participated in the signing of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance, once said: "For France and Russia, unity is strength, and division is dangerous. This is the most necessary lesson learned from past experience and common sense." This is not without basis. Before the Second World War, the Soviet Union and France also signed the Franco-Soviet Pact of Mutual Assistance in May 1935, which played an important role in preventing aggression by Hitler's Germany. However, the French bourgeois government refused to take joint action with the Soviet Union on the basis of this treaty to stop the aggressive expansion of German militarism, and preferred to seek "friendly cooperation" with Hitler's Germany, even signing the Franco-German Declaration with Hitler in December 1938, calling on Hitler to invade the East. The result of France disregarding Franco-Soviet friendship and "cooperating" with Hitler was that France was trampled under the jackboots of the German "Wehrmacht" in the Second World War launched by Hitler, that France endured the occupied and shameful era of the Vichy regime, and that France's entire young generation paid a heavy price in lives and blood. This bloody lesson should be unforgettable for France!

    The current reality is that France's rulers are repeating the mistakes of the period before the Second World War, striving to form an alliance with France's sworn enemy—German militarism—to oppose France's true friend, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries in Europe. The Paris Agreements signed by France with the United States, Britain, and other Western European countries are treaties by which France abandons the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance and allies itself with German militarism. French Prime Minister Mendès France stated in a conversation on November 19 that "cooperation between France and Germany should be realized on the basis of the recent Paris Agreements."

    It is well known that the Paris Agreements, which are the "basis" for Franco-German "cooperation," have the open purpose of reviving German militarism. According to the Paris Agreements, West Germany will establish an army of 500,000 men led by Hitler's generals. At the same time, the German militarist forces, which have been rearmed according to this agreement, will be pulled into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and the Western European military alliance. This means that France will become partners with Bonn Germany, which harbors "revenge" ambitions, and jointly participate in an aggressive military bloc. The spearhead of aggression of this military bloc is openly directed against the Soviet Union, as well as other peace-loving countries in Europe. Therefore, it is obvious that the Paris Agreements in which France participates are fundamentally incompatible with the obligations undertaken by France under the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

    The harm that the Paris Agreements can cause to France will certainly not be less than the disasters of the Second World War. To conceal this point from public opinion, supporters of the Paris Agreements are trying to promote the "restrictions" on the level of the West German army and the "supervision" of West German armaments. But no one believes these rumors. Even the British bourgeois newspaper "Daily Express" believes that "only fools would believe that new German soldiers can be reliably supervised." In fact, West Germany already has 200,000 police officers, as well as 250,000 so-called "service teams" and other militarized auxiliary organizations. In addition, the fact that various militarist organizations have been widely expanding in West Germany in recent years is also well known. Once the Paris Agreements are implemented, the German militarist "Wehrmacht" will not have 500,000 men, but far more than this number. At the same time, according to the Paris Agreements, this West German "Wehrmacht" will also be equipped with atomic weapons, biological weapons, and chemical weapons. Thus, if German militarism is rearmed in the name of the Paris Agreements and embarks on the path of aggression and revenge, then France will face an inevitable catastrophe.

    The Soviet government has repeatedly pointed out to the French government the dangerous nature of the Paris Agreements, and has pointed out that France's participation in this agreement violates the letter and spirit of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance. In order to prevent the revival of German militarism, the Soviet government has repeatedly proposed holding a meeting of the four foreign ministers to discuss the issue of restoring German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis; and has suggested holding a meeting of all European countries to plan for the establishment of an all-European collective security system. The purpose of these Soviet proposals is to guarantee European peace and the security of all European countries, large and small, and also to guarantee the security of France. Accepting such proposals requires France to abandon the Paris Agreements, a plan that harms others and benefits itself. Only in this way can France be spared the danger of being trampled under the iron heel of the German "Wehrmacht" again, and at the same time, Franco-Soviet friendly relations can be consolidated and developed.

    However, the French government not only rejected the above-mentioned Soviet proposals together with the United States and Britain, and did not attend the European countries meeting held in Moscow on November 29, but also insisted on accelerating the ratification of the Paris Agreements, and is forcing the French National Assembly to debate the issue of ratifying the Paris Agreements as soon as possible. The fate of France is facing another important juncture in its history.

    As the Soviet government said in its note to the French government: "In this case, the Soviet government believes that it has a responsibility to announce that the action of ratifying the Paris Agreements will cancel the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance and will invalidate this treaty. The entire responsibility for this situation rests with France, with the French government." Therefore, the Soviet government's statement that it will abrogate the Franco-Soviet Treaty if the Paris Agreements are ratified is obviously a very just and reasonable action.

    There is no doubt that the Soviet government's note is a great encouragement to the struggle of the rising patriotic forces in France against the revival of West German militarism. French progressive public opinion and patriotic people resolutely advocate rejecting the Paris Agreements, keeping France friendly with the Soviet Union, and not allowing France to be isolated in the face of German militarism. The call of French patriotic forces cannot be ignored. If the French supporters of the Paris Agreements, regardless of the Soviet Union's clear warnings and the opposition of French patriotic forces, insist on ratifying the Paris Agreements and forming a sinful alliance with German militarism, history will surely make a fair judgment on them.

    法国面临着重要的选择
    高集
    苏联政府于十二月十六日向法国政府提出照会，声明如果法国批准巴黎协定，苏联政府就只能向苏联最高苏维埃主席团提出废除法苏同盟互助条约的建议。这对法国提出了一个重大的选择，那就是：法国究竟是要巩固法苏友谊以保障法国的安全和欧洲的和平呢，还是要复活德国军国主义，而使法国再一次面临侵略的威胁，并使欧洲的新战争的危机大大增加起来呢？
    因此，很显然，苏联政府的照会是苏联坚决反对复活德国军国主义，努力维护欧洲和平的重要行动。
    在一九四四年十二月签订的法苏条约，是为了防止战后德国军国主义进行新侵略的可能。条约的第三条规定：“缔约国双方承诺在现行对德战争结束后，共同采取一切必要措置，以消灭任何来自德国方面的新威胁，并且阻止可能造成德国新侵略企图的任何行动。”条约的第五条规定：“缔约国双方承诺决不缔结反对缔约国一方或另一方的同盟或加入反对缔约国一方或另一方的集团。”德国军国主义势力在二十世纪以来的短短时期中，曾两度对法国进行了血腥的侵略战争，并使欧洲陷入可怕的、毁灭性的灾难之中。因此，在以巨大的牺牲和代价战胜纳粹德国之后，法苏两国以条约的形式结成反对德国军国主义的联盟，这不但符合于法苏两国人民的利益，而且对于保障欧洲和平也有着重大的意义。
    苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在莫斯科举行的法苏条约缔结十周年纪念大会上的演说中说：“法苏条约应当成为保障欧洲和平的基石”，这句话深刻地说明了法苏条约的重要性。
    法苏的友好关系对于法国尤其有着重要的意义。曾经参与签订法苏同盟互助条约的戴高乐将军就曾说过：“对于法国和俄国来说，团结就是强大的力量，而分裂就要遭到危险。这是从过去的经验和常识中得来的最必要的教训。”这话不是没有根据的。第二次世界大战之前，苏联和法国也曾在一九三五年五月签订了具有防止希特勒德国进行侵略的重要作用的法苏互助公约。但是法国资产阶级政府却不肯在这个条约的基础上和苏联采取共同行动，以制止德国军国主义的侵略扩张，而宁愿寻求和希特勒德国的“友善合作”，甚至在一九三八年十二月和希特勒签订了法、德宣言，叫希特勒向东方侵略。法国不顾法苏友好关系而和希特勒“合作”的结果：是法国在希特勒所发动的第二次世界大战中遭到德国“国防军”长靴的践踏，是法国的被占领和维奇政权的可耻的年代，是法国整个青年一代付出了大量的生命和鲜血。这个血的教训，对于法国应该是十分难以忘怀的吧！
    目前的事实是：法国的统治者正在重复着第二次世界大战之前的覆辙，努力要和法国的世仇——德国军国主义结成联盟，来反对法国的真正的朋友苏联以及欧洲其他爱好和平的国家。法国和美国、英国以及其他西欧国家所签订的巴黎协定，就是法国背弃法苏同盟互助条约而和德国军国主义结盟的条约。法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯在十一月十九日的谈话中就曾表示：“法德两国的合作应在最近的巴黎协定的基础上来实现”。
    人所共知，所谓作为法德“合作”的“基础”的巴黎协定是以复活德国军国主义为其公开的目的。根据巴黎协定，西德将建立起一支由希特勒的将领率领的、拥有五十万人的军队。同时根据这个协定被重新武装起来的德国军国主义势力将被拉入北大西洋侵略集团和西欧军事联盟。这就是说，法国将和怀有“复仇”野心的波恩德国结成伙伴，共同参加一个侵略性的军事集团。这个军事集团的侵略矛头是公开指向苏联，同时也指向欧洲其他爱好和平的国家的。因而，显而易见，法国所参加的巴黎协定，是和法国根据法苏同盟互助条约所担承的义务根本相抵触的。
    巴黎协定对于法国所可造成的危害，绝对不会比第二次世界大战的灾难来得更小。巴黎协定的拥护者为了在舆论面前掩饰这一点，正在竭力宣传巴黎协定对于西德军队水平的“限制”和对西德军备的“监督”。但是这种谰言是没有人相信的。甚至英国资产阶级的报纸“每日快报”也认为：“只有傻瓜才会相信新德国士兵可以加以可靠的监督”。事实上，现在西德已经拥有二十万的警察部队，还有二十五万人的所谓“服务队”及其他军国主义化的辅助组织。此外，近几年来，形形色色的军国主义组织在西德广泛扩张的事实，也是人所共知的。一旦巴黎协定付诸实施，德国军国主义的“国防军”将不是拥有五十万人，而是远远超过这个数字。同时，根据巴黎协定，这支西德的“国防军”还将配备有原子武器、生物武器和化学武器。这样，如果德国军国主义在巴黎协定的名义下重新武装起来，并走向侵略复仇的道路，那么法国就将面临一场难以避免的浩劫的。
    苏联政府早已一再向法国政府指出巴黎协定的危险性质，并指出法国参加这个协定违反了法苏同盟互助条约的文字和精神。为了防止德国军国主义的复活，苏联政府曾不止一次地建议举行四国外长会议，以讨论在和平民主的基础上恢复德国统一的问题；并建议为筹划建立一个全欧集体安全体系而举行全体欧洲国家的会议。苏联这些建议的目的，是保障欧洲的和平以及欧洲一切大小国家的安全，同时也是为了保障法国的安全。接受这样的建议，就要求法国必须放弃巴黎协定这种损人害己的计划。因为只有这样，才能使法国免除再一次遭受德国“国防军”的铁蹄蹂躏的危险，同时也可以巩固和发展法苏友好关系。
    但是，法国政府不但和美国以及英国拒绝了苏联上述的建议，没有出席十一月二十九日在莫斯科召开的欧洲国家会议，而且执意要加速批准巴黎协定，为此正迫使法国国民议会早日就批准巴黎协定的问题进行辩论。法国的命运正在面临着它的历史上又一个重要的关头。
    正如苏联政府在致法国政府的照会中所说的：“在这种情况下，苏联政府认为它有责任宣布：批准巴黎协定的行动会勾销法苏同盟互助条约，会使这个条约作废。这种情况的全部责任要由法国、由法国政府来负。”因此，苏联政府声明如果巴黎协定一旦获得批准，苏联就将废除法苏条约，这显然是十分正当的，合理的行动。
    毫无疑问，苏联政府的照会对于正在不断高涨中的法国爱国力量反对复活西德军国主义的斗争是巨大的鼓舞力量。法国的进步舆论和爱国人士都坚决主张否决巴黎协定，使法国与苏联友好，而不使法国在德国军国主义面前陷于孤立。法国爱国力量的这种呼声是不容忽视的。巴黎协定的法国拥护者们，如果不顾苏联的明白的警告，不顾法国爱国力量的反对，一定要使巴黎协定获得批准而和德国军国主义结成罪恶的联盟的话，历史一定会对他们作出公正的裁判。
