To support the state's procurement of agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oilseeds, Shanghai's state-owned commercial departments are actively organizing increased production of industrial goods based on information gathered by recent visiting sales teams in various regions. The total value of additional processing orders placed by only the four procurement and supply units for department stores, medicine, hardware machinery, and transportation and electrical equipment in the fourth quarter is equivalent to the value of more than 1.6 million dan of grain. The increased production includes over 53,000 dozens of various undershirts and pants, jerseys, cotton sweaters and pants, 200,000 dozens of men's and women's socks, over 87,000 pounds of yarn, 770,000 pairs of rubber shoes, 440,000 dozens of batteries, 150,000 boxes of vanishing cream, as well as dyes, small hardware, prepared medicines, tonics, Weishuping, aspirin tablets, and sulfur blue needed in rural areas.

Due to the procurement units’ timely guidance and improvements to production based on consumer demands, the quality, specifications, colors, and packaging of products are now more suited to current rural needs. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National General Merchandise Company has changed the undershirts sold in rural areas to large-sleeved, open-front styles that are convenient for farmers to wear during production, and has added more than ten colors favored by farmers, such as jujube red and royal blue. Most of the pens sold in rural areas, in addition to increasing the variety of patterned barrels, are also gradually being converted to iridium pen nibs for greater durability and writing convenience. Hairpins especially favored by rural girls have added more than ten new styles such as "Pine Flower" and "Unity," and the variety of colors and patterns for men's, women's, and children's socks has also increased by more than fifty. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has also newly designed 650 types of winter fabrics. In addition, the procurement and supply units for chemical raw materials and medicine are also paying special attention to increasing the production of small-packaged dyes, paints, and prepared medicines based on rural characteristics. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Chemical Raw Materials Company produced more than 500,000 small bags of dyes in the fourth quarter.

Currently, these industrial products are being continuously transferred from Shanghai to grain and cotton producing areas across the country. Among the daily necessities produced in excess of the fourth-quarter plan by the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National General Merchandise Company, over 10,000 dozens of plain socks, 40,000 dozens of batteries, and 16,000 pounds of yarn have been transferred to Jiangsu; over 8,000 dozens of rubber shoes and 6,000 bed sheets have been transferred to Jiangxi, a rice-producing area.

    增产农民喜爱的工业品
    上海市国营商业部门根据最近派到各地的访问推销队所了解的情况，积极组织增产工业品，支持国家收购粮食、棉花和油料等农产品的工作。仅百货、医药、五金机械、交通电工器材等四个采购供应单位在第四季度计划以外扩大的加工订货总值，即相当于一百六十余万担粮食的价值。在增产的商品中，有各种卫生衫裤、球衫、棉毛衫裤五万三千余打、男女袜子二十万打、毛线八万七千余磅、胶鞋七十七万双、电池四十四万打、雪花膏十五万打，还有为当前农村需要的染料、小五金、成药、补剂、胃舒平、阿司匹灵片、硫化蓝等。
    由于各采购单位根据消费者的要求，及时指导改进生产，使产品的品质、规格、花色、包装更适合当前农村的需要。中国百货公司上海采购供应站已将运销农村的卫生衫改为便于农民生产时穿的大袖开襟式，并增添了枣红、品蓝等十余种为农民所喜爱的颜色。大部分运销于农村的钢笔，除增加各种花杆式样外，还逐步改制为铱金笔尖，以求更加耐用和便利书写。农村姑娘特别喜爱的发夹已增加了
  “松花”“团结”等十余种新式样，男女花袜和童袜的花色品种也比前增加了五十余种。中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站也新设计了六百五十种冬令花布。此外，化工原料和医药等采购供应单位也都根据农村特点，特别重视小型包装染料、油漆、成药的增产。中国化工原料公司上海采购供应站第四季度生产的小袋染料，即有五十余万袋。
    目前，这些工业产品正不断从上海调送至全国粮棉产区。中国百货公司上海采购供应站在四季度计划以外增产的日用百货中，已调往江苏的平口袜有一万余打，电池四万打，毛线一万六千磅；调往产米区江西的胶鞋有八千余打，被单六千余条。
