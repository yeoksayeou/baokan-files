Xinhua News Agency, London, December 29th. TASS: The "Daily Worker's" parliamentary correspondent wrote: Many Labour MPs expressed indignation at the British government's pressure on France to secure the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

According to the reporter, the House of Commons will reconvene on January 25th after the Christmas recess, at which time Eden will have to answer many questions from Labour MPs who oppose the rearmament of Germany. Some Labour MPs also intend to request a special meeting of the Labour Parliamentary Group to discuss the issue of a vote of no confidence in Eden.

Several MPs were outraged that Eden waited until the parliamentary recess to issue statements threatening French MPs.

The reporter wrote: "Labour MPs are dissatisfied with the British government's habit of issuing outrageous statements after parliamentary recesses. This threat to France is the latest example. Eden often talks about 'free elections' and 'non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.' But this interference is the most blatant yet."

    对于英政府向法国横施压力的行为
    英国许多工党议员表示愤慨
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十九日讯：英国“工人日报”驻议会记者写道：许多工党议员对英国政府为了要使巴黎协定获得批准而对法国施加压力表示愤慨。
    据记者指出，下院在圣诞节休假后将在一月二十五日复会，在那个时候，艾登将不得不回答反对武装德国的工党议员的许多问题。某些工党议员还打算要求召开工党议会党团的特别会议，来讨论关于对艾登投不信任票的问题。
    若干议员感到愤激的是：艾登等到议会休会的时候，发表恐吓法国议员的声明。
    记者写道：“工党议员对英国政府往往趁议会休会后发表令人愤慨的声明表示不满。这次对法国的威胁是最近的例子。艾登常常谈论‘自由选举’和‘不干涉其他国家的内政’。但是这一次的干涉是最明显不过的了。”
