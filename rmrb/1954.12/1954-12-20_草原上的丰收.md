　　Sitting in the car going to Kangbao County, you can see herds of fine horses grazing on the grassland; you can see horse-drawn carts and transport trucks coming and going, loaded with grain and goods; you can also see the male and female farmers busy threshing in the winter fields, vigorously swinging their flails, carefully collecting the sacks of wheat, not letting a single grain be lost.
　　Kangbao County is a county in the northernmost part of Hebei Province, bordering the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. More than thirty years ago, this was an uninhabited grassland. Now it has become a place rich in naked oats, flax, and wheat. This year it has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The county's 136,000 people have harvested more than 210 million jin of grain, an average of more than 1,600 jin per person. After deducting food, seeds, and fodder, the county can still export more than 140 million jin of grain. If this grain were transported from Kangbao to Zhangjiakou by truck, at one trip per day, it would take 100 trucks nine and a half months.
　　Kangbao County's bumper harvest this year is inseparable from the help of the state. The People's Bank has issued a total of more than 7.9 billion yuan in loans, solving the farmers' difficulties in production investment. In addition to guiding farmers to improve farming techniques, the government also provided free rinderpest vaccinations for more than 9,000 cattle, greatly improving the quality of cultivation.
　　After the bumper harvest, the grassland farmers enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state and bought large quantities of production and living materials. The total sales of Kangbao County Department Store in one month reached 1.3 billion yuan; the supply and marketing cooperative sold 4,000 wool sweaters in ten days; Xinhua Bookstore has sold more than 70,000 books, of which "How to Run Agricultural Production Cooperatives" accounted for the vast majority.
　　At present, the farmers are combining the mutual aid and cooperation movement with winter production, striving for an even greater harvest next year.

    草原上的丰收
    王韶光
    坐在去康保县的汽车上，沿途可以看见牧放在草原上的一群群的骏马；可以看见来往奔驰的满载着粮食和货物的牛马大车和运输汽车；也可以看见正忙着打冬场的男女农民，他们用力地抡起连枷，小心地收拾着装麦的口袋，不让一粒粮食丢掉。
    康保县是河北省最北部和内蒙古自治区接壤的一个县份，三十多年前这里还是一片没有人烟的草地，现在已经变成盛产莜麦、胡麻和小麦的地方了。今年这里更获得了空前未有的丰收，全县十三万六千多口人，就收了两亿一千多万斤粮食，每人平均一千六百多斤。除去食粮、种籽和饲料等，全县尚可输出粮食一亿四千多万斤。如果把这些粮食用汽车从康保运到张家口，按一天一趟计算，需一百辆汽车运九个半月。
    康保县今年的丰收，是和国家的帮助分不开的。人民银行共发放贷款七十九亿多元，解决了农民生产投资的困难，政府除领导农民改进耕作技术外，并免费为九千多条牛进行了预防牛瘟注射，使耕作质量大大提高。
    丰收后的草原农民，踊跃地把余粮卖给国家，买进大批生产和生活资料。康保县百货公司一个月的销货总额达十三亿元；供销合作社十天内就销出绒衣四千件；新华书店共已销出七万多册书籍，其中“怎样办农业生产合作社”占绝大比重。
    目前，农民们正结合互助合作运动进行冬季生产，争取明年更大的丰收。
