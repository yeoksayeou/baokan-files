Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 12th: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee concluded its discussion on the issue of acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China and the responsibility of the US Navy for these acts on the 10th.

    Czechoslovakia's representative, Vavřička, stated during the discussion that the aggressive actions of the US armed forces against the People's Republic of China threatened peace and security in the Far East. Taiwan Island, occupied by the US armed forces, has been turned into a major base for aggression against the People's Republic of China and for provocative actions creating disruption to peace and security in the Far East. The continued US occupation of Taiwan and obstruction of its return to the embrace of the Chinese people is a serious violation of international agreements, interference in China's internal affairs, and damage to China's territorial integrity. This behavior harbors the danger of new incidents and thus threatens peace in the Far East.

    Ukraine's representative, Slipchenko, and Belarus's representative, Astapenko, pointed out that the United Nations cannot ignore the continuous aggressive actions of the US armed forces against China.

    Poland's representative, Katz-Suchy, pointed out that the recently signed military treaty between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang poses a serious threat to China's security and peace in the Far East.

    India's representative, A. Lall, said that his delegation agreed with the Soviet delegation's opinion that the cessation of hostilities in Korea and the restoration of peace in Indochina had created favorable conditions for resolving other major international issues and further easing international tensions. He said he agreed with the Soviet delegation's opinion that to eliminate the dangerous situation already created in the Far East, aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China must be stopped. However, he said that in order to seek a peaceful resolution to this issue, the proposal should not directly mention the responsibility of the United States.

    The Indian representative said that his delegation had repeatedly stated, and now reiterates, that the absence of a representative of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is a major factor hindering the resolution of some issues.

    Representatives from Turkey, Belgium, France, Colombia, and Canada spoke against the Soviet delegation's proposal. They slandered the People's Republic of China and attempted to deny the facts presented by the Soviet delegation proving that the US armed forces were responsible for aggressive actions against the Chinese people.

    Representatives from Britain, Australia, and New Zealand also opposed the Soviet proposal.

    At the end of the discussion, Soviet representative Sobolev spoke. He said that the General Assembly must take all measures to stop aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China.

    Subsequently, the Soviet delegation's proposal was put to a vote. Twenty delegations (Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, Belarus, India, Indonesia, Burma, France, etc.) voted in favor of the first point of the proposal: that the recent cessation of the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina had created favorable conditions for resolving other outstanding international issues and further easing international tensions. Twelve delegations (including the United States) voted against. Fifteen delegations (including Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Greece, etc.) abstained.

    The other points in the proposal were rejected by a majority vote. The committee rejected the entire proposal by a majority vote.

    On the 13th, the Special Political Committee will begin discussing the next item on the agenda—the issue of violating freedom of navigation on China's coastal waters.

    联大特别政委会竟无理否决关于美国侵略中国的提案
    苏捷等国代表再次斥责美国的侵略行为
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会十日结束了关于侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任问题的讨论。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表瓦夫里茨卡在讨论中发言说，美国武装部队侵略中华人民共和国的行为威胁着远东地区的和平和安全。美国武装部队侵占的台湾岛已经被变为侵略中华人民共和国和制造破坏远东和平和安全的挑衅行为的主要基地。美国继续占领台湾并且阻挠台湾归入中国人民怀抱，就是严重地破坏了国际协议，就是干涉中国的内政和破坏中国领土的完整。这种行为包藏着发生新事件的危险，因而威胁着远东和平。
    乌克兰代表斯利普钦科和白俄罗斯代表阿斯塔平科指出，联合国不能不过问美国武装部队不断侵略中国的行为。
    波兰代表卡茨—苏希指出，不久以前美国和蒋介石匪帮签订的军事条约对中国的安全和远东的和平造成了严重的威胁。
    印度代表阿·拉尔说，他的代表团同意苏联代表团的意见，即朝鲜敌对行动的停止和印度支那和平的恢复已经为解决其他重大国际问题和进一步缓和国际紧张局势创造了有利条件。他说，他同意苏联代表团的意见，认为要消除已经在远东造成的危险形势，必须终止对中华人民共和国的侵略行动。然而，他说，为了求得这个问题的和平解决，在提案内不应该直接提到美国的责任。
    印度代表说，他的代表团曾再三说过，并且现在再次说明，联合国内没有中华人民共和国代表，是妨碍一些问题获得解决的主要因素。
    土耳其、比利时、法国、哥伦比亚和加拿大代表发言反对苏联代表团的提案。他们对中华人民共和国进行诽谤，并企图否认苏联代表团所列举的证明美国武装部队要对侵略中国人民的行为负责的事实。
    英国、澳大利亚和新西兰等国代表也反对苏联的提案。
    在讨论结束时，苏联代表索波列夫发言。他说，大会必须采取各种措施来制止对中华人民共和国的侵略行动。
    接着，苏联代表团的提案交付表决。二十个代表团（苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和法国等）投票赞成提案的第一点：最近朝鲜战争的停止和印度支那和平的恢复，为解决其他未决的国际问题和进一步缓和国际紧张局势创造了有利的条件。十二个代表团（包括美国在内）投票反对。十五个代表团（包括英国、加拿大、新西兰、希腊等国）弃权。
    提案中其他各点被多数票所否决。委员会多数票否决了整个提案。
    十三日，特别政治委员会将开始讨论下一项议程——关于侵犯中国海面的航行自由问题。
