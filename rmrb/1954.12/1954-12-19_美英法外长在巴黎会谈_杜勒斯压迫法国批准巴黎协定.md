    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 18th: According to TASS, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and British Foreign Secretary Eden, who traveled to Paris to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, held talks with French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mendès France on the 17th.
    According to some observers, the main purpose of Dulles' visit was to once again exert pressure on the French ruling circles to get the French parliament to approve the London and Paris agreements on arming West Germany.
    As can be seen from the United Press International report, Dulles again put forward American "guarantees." The United States "guaranteed" to France that the United States would keep its troops on the European continent.
    According to newspaper reports, Dulles and Eden promised to support Mendès France on the Saar issue, saying that if Paris and Bonn made simultaneous requests, the United States and Britain would be prepared to guarantee the maintenance of the Saar Agreement of the Franco-German agreement of October 23.
    The three foreign ministers also discussed the situation in Indochina. Although, at first glance, this issue is only a matter between France and the Indochinese countries, everyone knows that the policies adopted in the French-controlled parts of Indochina are determined by Washington, not Paris. Recently, this policy has worsened the situation in Indochina and undermined the ceasefire terms. All of this has caused serious anxiety in France. For example, the discussion in the Finance Committee of the French National Assembly on the draft budget for Indochina proposed by the French government for next year reflected this anxiety. The committee rejected the draft Indochina budget by a vote of 25 against, 14 in favor, and 5 abstentions. Many members of parliament demanded the withdrawal of the French expeditionary force from Indochina. According to "Le Monde," even right-wing party members, such as members of the Social Republican Party, are dissatisfied with "France's policy tilting too much towards the United States."
    However, Dulles and Mendès France also discussed on the 17th how to continue arming and training Bao Dai's army in South Vietnam.
    As for the issue of negotiations with the Soviet Union, newspaper reports indicate that the three Western foreign ministers still adhere to the position of "strength policy."

    美英法外长在巴黎会谈
    杜勒斯压迫法国批准巴黎协定
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：前往巴黎参加北大西洋集团理事会会议的美国国务卿杜勒斯和英国外交大臣艾登在十七日同法国总理兼外交部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯进行了会谈。
    据一些观察家的意见，杜勒斯在这次会谈中的主要目的是再一次对法国统治集团施加压力，使法国议会批准关于武装西德的伦敦和巴黎协定。
    从美国合众社的报道中可以看到，杜勒斯又提出了美国的“保证”。美国向法国“保证”，美国将把它的部队留在欧洲大陆上。
    据报纸报道，杜勒斯和艾登在萨尔问题上答应支持孟戴斯—弗朗斯，他们说，如果巴黎和波恩同时提出要求，美国和英国准备保证维持十月二十三日法德协议的萨尔协定。
    三国外长还讨论了印度支那局势。虽然，初看起来，这个问题只是法国和印度支那国家之间的事情。可是大家知道，在法国控制下的印度支那部分采取什么样的政策，已经是决定于华盛顿而不是巴黎了。近来这种政策已使印度支那局势恶化，使停战条款遭到破坏。所有这些已经在法国引起严重不安。例如，法国国民议会财政委员会关于法国政府所提出的明年印度支那预算草案的讨论，就反映了这种不安。这个委员会以二十五票反对、十四票赞成、五票弃权否决了印度支那预算草案。许多议员要求法国远征军从印度支那撤退。据“世界报”报道，右翼党派议员，如社会共和党议员，也不满意
  “法国的政策过分倒向美国”。
    但是，杜勒斯和孟戴斯—弗朗斯十七日还商量了如何继续武装和训练南越的保大军队的问题。
    至于同苏联谈判的问题，报纸消息表明，西方三国外长仍然坚持“实力政策”的立场。
