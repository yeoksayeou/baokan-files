Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 24th: Yugoslav President Tito and Indian Prime Minister Nehru issued a joint statement on the 23rd after their talks. The joint statement said that during their talks, they focused in particular on issues of common interest that they were both very concerned about.

The joint statement said that their respective countries have adopted and pursued a policy of non-alignment with blocs, "which seeks to lead to collective peace, because only on the basis of collective peace can there be true collective security."

The joint statement said that the two governments are convinced that "war cannot solve problems," and that only in peace will the people of Yugoslavia and India have the opportunity for self-development.

The joint statement said: The relations between Yugoslavia and India "and between the two governments are, and must continue to be, based on the principles of recognizing each other's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's or other countries' internal affairs, in order to promote—for themselves and for the world—ways and conditions for peaceful coexistence. This fundamental concept should govern international relations and should be a primary factor in the policies and work of the United Nations."

The joint statement pointed out: The above-mentioned principles guiding the mutual relations between the two countries "are capable of being applied more widely. If these principles were more widely accepted, they would make a great contribution to easing world tensions and resolving outstanding conflicts. They will expand the area of peace, dispel the grim prospect of war, increase confidence, and increase opportunities for world cooperation."

The joint statement said that easing world tensions is a necessary prerequisite for the development of collective peace. The statement, in discussing "the necessity of accepting peaceful coexistence," said that this "is not only a choice, but a must."

    铁托总统和尼赫鲁总理会谈发表联合声明
    申明以和平共处五项原则为指导两国关系的基础
    【新华社新德里二十四日电】南斯拉夫总统铁托和印度总理尼赫鲁在会谈结束后在二十三日发表了联合声明。联合声明说，他们在会谈中特别着重地讨论了他们都非常关切的有共同利害关系的问题。
    联合声明说：他们各自的国家所采取和奉行的是不参加集团的政策，“这个政策设法导向集体和平，因为只有在集体和平的基础上才能有真正的集体安全”。
    联合声明说，两国政府深信，“战争不能解决问题”，只有在和平中，才会使南斯拉夫和印度两国人民有机会自我发展。
    联合声明说：南斯拉夫和印度“两国和两国政府之间的关系是，而且必须继续是以承认彼此主权、独立和领土完整，互不侵犯，平等，互相尊重和不干涉另一方的或他国的内政诸原则为基础，以促进——为了它们自己和为了世界——和平共处的办法和条件为基础。这个基本概念应当支配国际关系，应当成为联合国的政策和工作的首要因素”。
    联合声明指出：上述指导两国相互关系的原则“是能够更广泛地加以应用的。如果这些原则被更广泛地接受，它们就会对缓和世界紧张局势和解决悬而未决的冲突作出很大贡献。它们将扩大和平地区，消散战争的可怕前景，提高信心，并增加世界合作的机会。”
    联合声明说，缓和世界紧张局势是发展集体和平的必要的先决条件。声明在谈到“接受和平共处的必要性”时说，这“不仅是一种选择，而且是必须这样做”。
