    Hunan Province Actively Promotes Industrial Products
    State-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province are actively promoting industrial products. Relevant departments in various special districts and the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region have organized more than 1,200 promotion teams, and more than 80 counties have established promotion groups to actively assist grassroots state-owned stores and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in carrying out promotion work. Under the leadership of the Provincial Department of Commerce, various provincial state-owned specialized companies have organized a transportation office to uniformly allocate materials downward. From the beginning of October to the beginning of November, more than 60,000 tons of goods have been allocated downward. Many grassroots cooperatives in Xiangtan, Shaoyang, Chenxian, Hengyang and other special districts are holding commodity exhibitions and small-scale material exchange meetings. Shuangfeng County held 28 small-scale material exchange meetings from November 4th to 15th, and the turnover of state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives increased by more than 1.1 billion yuan. In many areas, state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives have also organized peddlers and vendors to go deep into the countryside to promote industrial products. The three special districts of Xiangtan, Hengyang, and Shaoyang alone have organized more than 1,600 peddlers and more than 100 vendors to participate in this work.
