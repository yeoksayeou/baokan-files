The Iron and Steel Industry Administration of the Ministry of Heavy Industry completed its annual total production value plan, as well as its annual production plans for pig iron, special steel, and rolled steel products, by November 30th. Fifty-five percent of the Administration's enterprises completed their total production value plans ahead of schedule, and eleven factories and mines completed all major product plans ahead of schedule.

The total production value of the Administration reached 101% of the plan, an increase of 31% compared to the same period last year. Pig iron reached 102% of the plan, special steel reached 104% of the plan, and rolled steel products reached 102% of the plan. Enterprises that completed or exceeded their total production value plans include: Tianjin Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Fushun Steel Plant, Dalian Steel Plant, Asia Steel Plant, Ma'anshan Iron Plant, Liguo Iron Mine, Nanshu Graphite Plant, Lehua Manganese Mine, Tanxiang Manganese Mine, First Iron Mine, Factory 102, Qijiang Iron Mine, Shanghai Second Steel Plant, Shanghai Third Steel Plant, Factory 105, etc. Enterprises that completed or exceeded all major product plans include: Tangshan Steel Plant, Dalian Steel Plant, Shanghai Third Steel Plant, Shanghai Second Steel Plant, First Iron Mine, Liguo Iron Mine, Tanxiang Manganese Mine, Lehua Manganese Mine, Asia Steel Plant, Factory 105, and Qijiang Iron Mine.

The reasons for the Iron and Steel Industry Administration's early completion of the plan, apart from the conservative plans of individual factories and mines and the emergence of more favorable factors during production than anticipated during planning, are mainly that enterprises this year have conscientiously combined their specific circumstances to study and promote advanced Soviet experience and have implemented the central tasks assigned by the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Iron and Steel Industry Administration.

In pig iron smelting, due to the study and promotion of advanced Soviet experiences such as "furnace top regulation," "raw material management," and "steam blowing," the actual output of pig iron in the first quarter of this year for the entire Administration increased by 6.8% compared to the best fourth quarter of last year. In electric furnace steel production, advanced Soviet experience was also studied and promoted. In the first quarter of this year, 30% to 45% of the electric furnace steel produced by the entire Administration was smelted using the Soviet "non-oxidation method," increasing the total output of electric furnace steel by 37.6% compared to the same period last year. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant significantly increased the service life of furnace walls after implementing "large brick furnace walls." For example, the furnace wall of a certain furnace averaged 57 uses at the end of last year, but reached 137 uses in the first half of this year.

In rolled steel production, the main focus was on promoting the advanced experience of small reversing mills and automation. In the first half of this year, 73% of the enterprises in the Administration had increased their mechanized equipment, which greatly improved working conditions, further ensured safe production, increased labor productivity, and reduced costs. For example, before the implementation of small-scale mechanization in the Rolling Mill Department of the Tangshan Steel Plant, a total of 3,780 hours of sick leave were taken due to work-related injuries in more than six months. After the implementation of small-scale mechanization, this was reduced to 708 hours in more than six months. The initial implementation of mechanization in the Rolling Mill Department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant saved 40 people. After the automatic steel-running machine at the Fourth Branch of the Tianjin Steel Plant was put into production, the output per machine hour could be increased by 7.33% compared to the quota.

The Administration has basically completed the establishment of a production area responsibility system this year and is continuing to carry out technical management work. The establishment of the production area responsibility system has overcome to some extent the undesirable phenomena of decentralization, multiple leadership, acting independently, disobeying commands, and being passive, negative, and irresponsible in many enterprises, and has gradually formed a new atmosphere of centralization and unity, active responsibility, and active research.

All enterprises of the Administration are now actively preparing for next year's production to create favorable conditions for completing next year's plan.

    钢铁工业管理局提前完成全年产值计划
    重工业部钢铁工业管理局在十一月三十日已经完成了全年生产总值计划，和全年生铁、特殊钢、钢压延品的生产计划。全局有百分之五十五的企业提前完成了生产总值计划，有十一个厂矿提前完成了全部主要产品计划。
    全局生产总值完成计划百分之一○一，比去年同期增长百分之三十一。生铁完成计划一○二，特殊钢完成计划一○四，钢压延品完成计划一○二。完成或超额完成生产总值计划的企业有：天津钢厂、唐山钢厂、太原钢铁厂、抚顺钢厂、大连钢厂、亚细亚钢铁厂、马鞍山铁厂、利国铁矿、南墅石墨厂、乐华锰矿、潭湘锰矿、第一铁矿、一○二厂、綦江铁矿、上海第二钢铁厂、上海第三钢铁厂、一○五厂等。完成或超额完成全部主要产品计划的企业有：唐山钢厂、大连钢厂、上海第三钢铁厂、上海第二钢铁厂、第一铁矿、利国铁矿、潭湘锰矿、乐华锰矿、亚细亚钢铁厂、一○五厂、綦江铁矿。
    钢铁工业局提前完成计划的原因，除了个别厂矿计划保守，在生产期间出现了比作计划时较多的有利因素以外，主要的是各企业在今年认真地结合具体情况，学习和推广了苏联先进经验，并贯彻了重工业部和钢铁工业管理局所布置的中心工作。
    在炼铁方面，由于学习和推广了苏联先进经验“炉顶调剂”、“原料管理”和“蒸气鼓风”等，全局今年第一季度生铁的实际产量，就比去年最良好的第四季实际产量提高了百分之六·八。在电炉钢生产方面，也学习和推广了苏联先进经验。全局今年第一季有百分之三十到四十五的电炉钢是采用苏联“不氧化法”冶炼的，使电炉钢总产量比去年同期增加百分之三十七·六。太原钢铁厂推行“大块?砖炉壁”后大大提高了炉墙使用寿命，如某号炉的炉墙去年年底平均使用五十七次，今年上半年就达到了一百三十七次。
    在钢压延品生产方面，主要是推广了小型反围盘和自动化的先进经验。今年上半年全局已有百分之七十三的企业增加了机械化设备，这就大大地改善了劳动条件，并进一步保证了安全生产，提高了劳动生产率，降低了成本。如唐山钢厂轧钢部在推行小型机械化之前，在半年多的时间里因工伤事故请假共三千七百八十小时，推行小型机械化后半年多的时间里降低到七百零八小时；太原钢铁厂轧钢部初步推行机械化，节省四十人；天津钢厂四分厂自动跑钢机投入生产后，可使机时产量较定额提高百分之七·三三。
    全局在今年基本上完成了建立生产区域责任制的工作，并正在继续开展技术管理的工作。生产区域责任制的建立使得不少企业中的分散、多头、各自为政、不服从指挥以及被动消极、不负责任等不良现象有了一定程度的克服，使集中统一、主动负责、积极钻研等新风气逐渐形成。
    全局各企业现在正积极进行明年的生产准备工作，为完成明年的计划创造良好条件。
