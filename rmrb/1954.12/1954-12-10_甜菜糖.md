    Beet Sugar
    By Our Correspondent Jin Yukun

    An Ideal Beet Sugar Industrial Zone
    October is the harvest season for sugar beets on both sides of the Songhua River and the Mudan River. Every morning, farmers drive oxcarts to deliver the abundant sugar beets to the purchasing stations.
    Sugar beet, commonly known as "sugar radish," is an economic crop suitable for the icy and snowy north and used for sugar production. Sugar beet processing is seasonal, starting around October each year and ending at the end of March of the following year. This is because the sugar content of sugar beets gradually dissolves and disappears when the weather gets warmer. Therefore, beet sugar factories are located in the cold north. The banks of the Songhua River and Mudan River in Heilongjiang Province have fertile black oil sandy soil, and the climate and rainfall are suitable for growing sugar beets. In particular, Acheng, Shuangcheng, Lalin, Hulan and other places, farmers have accumulated 30 to 40 years of planting experience. The freezing period here is more than five months, which is truly an ideal sugar industry zone.
    Beet sugar has better conditions in production than cane sugar. The growing period of sugarcane is 18 months, while sugar beet only needs six months. The roots of sugar beet are two meters deep, which can loosen the soil and provide sufficient nutrients, and intercropping with wheat is of great benefit to the soil. Therefore, planting sugar beets does not conflict with planting grain, but is conducive to increasing grain production. Every 100 catties of sugar beet produces two more catties of sugar than every 100 catties of sugarcane. After the sugar is extracted, the sugar beet pulp is the best feed for livestock such as cattle and sheep. In the Soviet Union, there are livestock farms near beet sugar factories. Heilongjiang Province in our country also raises many Dutch dairy cows. The waste molasses from sugar factories can be used to make alcohol, penicillin, glycerin, and fusel oil for manufacturing various spices. These are all closely related to people's lives.
      "Worry Knots" Transformed into "Golden Knots"
    In our country, cane sugar production has a long history, while beet sugar industry is still an emerging industry. At the beginning of the 20th century, during the Russo-Japanese War, a Polish Tsarist Russian officer named Gratus—the son of a Warsaw sugar industry capitalist—was injured and recuperated on the banks of the Ashi River east of Harbin. He discovered that this beautiful place was a good base for establishing a beet sugar industry. So, in 1905, he established the first beet sugar factory in Acheng on the Ashi River. Then the Germans established a second sugar factory in Harbin. For nearly 50 years, the beet sugar industry, which benefited foreign capitalists, has not been developed. For example, the actual output of the Harbin Sugar Factory is only one-third of its design capacity, and the operating period is only two or three months each year.
    In order to pursue maximum profits, foreign capitalists ruthlessly exploited farmers, especially during the era of Japanese imperialism. The "North Manchuria Sugar Co., Ltd." forced farmers to grow sugar beets and bought them at low prices. Farmers worked hard for a year, and after sending the sugar beets to the factory, the money they earned was not enough to pay off the debts for fertilizer and seeds. Therefore, farmers called sugar beets "worry knots" and resisted planting them.
    After liberation, this kind of plundering of farmers was gone.
    The People's Government first adjusted the purchase price of sugar beets, so that the actual income per hectare of sugar beets was equivalent to the income of two to three hectares of wheat or soybeans, and provided farmers with a large number of sugar beet seeds every year. Each sugar factory has an agricultural technology guidance organization composed of one to two hundred people, who go deep into the fields to guide farmers in thinning seedlings, fertilizing, and cultivating, and are as close to the farmers as family members. Agricultural experts from scientific institutions and universities also often go to the countryside to help prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests.
    The actual income of farmers has increased. Every year after the autumn harvest, they build new houses, hitch up carts, and buy horses. In the past, farmers who grew sugar beets could not afford to eat sugar. At most, they would get a little bit to use as a medicinal guide when they were sick. Now every farmer's family has white sugar, which is used to make sweet glutinous rice cakes or to make sugar porridge and sugar soup for the children. The farmers have renamed the "worry knots" to "golden knots." Those who did not want to grow sugar beets in the past are now rushing to grow them, and using the best land and the best fertilizer to plant them.
    A Vigorously Developing Sugar Industry
    In recent years, Heilongjiang's beet sugar industry has also seen vigorous development. After the Acheng Sugar Factory and the Harbin Sugar Factory were converted to state-owned enterprises, they have been expanded, and their production rates have been greatly improved. For example, the output of the Acheng Sugar Factory this year is three times the highest annual output before liberation. The newly built Heping Sugar Factory and Hongguang Sugar Factory on the beautiful Songhua River and Nenjiang River were put into production last year. Poland, a country with rich experience in the beet sugar industry, is helping our country to build a large-scale modern sugar factory in Jiamusi, a new sugar beet growing area, which will be completed in October next year. In this modern sugar factory, most of the production process is semi-automatic, and workers carry out production under the guidance of various colored indicator instruments. This year, Heilongjiang Province also began to plan the construction of other new sugar factories.
    This year, Heilongjiang Province's annual sugar production has increased eight times compared with 1949, accounting for about 40% of the country's total machine-made sugar production. The Snowflake brand cotton sugar produced by the Acheng Sugar Factory has clean and tidy sugar grains, bright white color and luster, and does not get damp or yellow after being stored for a long time. It is deeply welcomed by consumers in large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Generally, it takes four hours to boil sugar in a crystallizing tank, but the workers of Acheng Sugar Factory only need three hours due to their good mastery, and the sugar particles produced are particularly uniform and tidy. The production period of sugar factories throughout the province has also been extended from three months to six months, reaching a higher level of sugar beet production period.
    Still Room for Improvement
    This year, Heilongjiang Province has generally had a bumper harvest of sugar beets, which can generally increase production by about 10% compared with last year, but the sugar content of sugar beets is still very low, except in places like Nehe. The sugar beets used by Acheng Sugar Factory and Heping Sugar Factory contain only about 13 catties of sugar per 100 catties, which is about 2 to 3 catties lower than in the past. Taking a sugar factory that consumes 1,000 tons of sugar beets per day as an example, as long as the sugar content per 100 catties of sugar beets is increased by one catty, it can increase the country's wealth by nearly 13 billion yuan throughout the year. In terms of yield per unit area, the yield per hectare in the Soviet Union can generally reach about 30 tons, while in Heilongjiang Province this year, it generally only reaches about 12 tons. Last year, the Sanhe Village Production Cooperative in Ning'an County, Heilongjiang Province, created a high-yield record of 32 tons per hectare, which shows that the possibility of increasing the yield per unit area is extremely high.
    The waste in the sugar production process is also worth noting. For example, the sugar loss rate of Acheng Sugar Factory is only about 2.7%, while the loss rate of other sugar factories, such as Harbin Sugar Factory, reaches 3.5% to 4%. This shows that as long as workers and farmers work hard to improve their skills, they can produce a lot of white sugar for the country and the people, and accumulate more wealth for the country.

    甜菜糖

    理想的甜菜糖工业区
    十月，是松花江和牡丹江两岸收获甜菜的季节。每天清晨，农民们驱着牛车，把丰硕的甜菜送到收购站去。
    甜菜——俗称为“糖萝卜”，是一种适于冰天雪地的北方，用来制糖的经济作物。甜菜制糖是有季节性的，于每年十月前后开始到第二年三月底结束。这是因为天暖了，甜菜含糖的成分便逐渐化解消失。因此，甜菜糖厂都设在寒冷的北方。黑龙江省的松花江和牡丹江的两岸有肥沃的黑油沙土，气候和雨量都适宜种植甜菜，特别是阿城、双城、拉林、呼兰等地，农民已积累三、四十年的种植经验，这里的冰冻期有五个月以上，真是理想的制糖工业区。
    甜菜糖在生产上比蔗糖具有更好的条件。甘蔗的生长期要十八个月，而甜菜只要六个月。甜菜根深二公尺，可使土壤松软并有充分养分，同小麦轮种对土壤有极大好处。因此，种甜菜同种粮食不但没有矛盾，而且有利于粮食的增产。每百斤甜菜比每百斤甘蔗还多出二斤糖。榨出糖分后的甜菜，是牛羊等牲畜的最好饲料。在苏联，在甜菜制糖厂附近都有畜牧场，我国黑龙江省也养育了许多荷兰乳牛。糖厂出的废蜜，可以用来做酒精、青霉素、甘油和制造各种香料用的杂醇油。这都是跟人民生活有密切联系的。
      “愁疙瘩”变“金疙瘩”
    在我国，甘蔗制糖已有悠久的历史，而甜菜制糖工业还是一个新兴的工业。二十世纪初，日俄战争期间波兰籍帝俄军官格拉图斯——华沙制糖工业资本家的儿子——负伤在哈尔滨以东的阿什河畔休养时，发现这个风景幽美的地方是建立甜菜制糖工业的良好基地。于是，一九○五年，他便在阿什河畔的阿城建立了第一个甜菜糖厂，接着德国人在哈尔滨建立了第二个糖厂。近五十年来，为外国资本家谋利的甜菜制糖工业未得到发展。如哈尔滨糖厂实际产量仅达设计能力的三分之一，每年开工期仅二、三个月。
    外国资本家为了追求最大限度的利润，对农民进行无情的压榨，特别在日本帝国主义统治时代，
  “北满制糖株式会社”强迫农民耕种甜菜，以贱价收买。农民辛辛苦苦种了一年，把甜菜送进了工厂，得的钱还不够抵肥料种子的债。因此农民称甜菜为“愁疙瘩”，都抗拒耕种。
    解放后，这种掠夺农民的行为没有了。
    人民政府首先调整了甜菜的收购价格，使每公顷的甜菜实际收益相当于二至三公顷的小麦或大豆的收入，每年给农民以大量甜菜种子。每个糖厂都设有由一、二百人组成的农业技术指导组织，深入田间指导农民间苗、施肥、耕种，同农民亲如家人。科学机关和大学里的农学家们也经常下乡帮助防治病虫害。
    农民的实际收益增加了，每年秋收后都纷纷盖新房、拴车买马。过去，农民种了甜菜吃不到糖，最多的在生病时弄一点当作药引子用。现在每个农民家里都有白糖，不用来沾黏米饽饽吃，就用来给孩子们做糖粥糖汤喝。农民们把“愁疙瘩”改称为
  “金疙瘩”，过去不愿种甜菜的现在都争着种，并且用最好的土地和最好的肥料来种。
    蓬勃发展的制糖工业
    几年来，黑龙江的甜菜制糖工业也有了蓬勃的发展。阿城糖厂和哈尔滨糖厂改为国家经营后，已进行了扩建，生产率大大提高。例如阿城糖厂今年产量为解放前最高年产量的三倍。在美丽的松花江和嫩江畔，新建的和平糖厂和红光糖厂已于去年投入生产。由波兰——对甜菜制糖工业富有经验的国家——帮助我国，在新的甜菜种植区佳木斯新建一座规模很大的现代化糖厂，将于明年十月建成。在这座现代化的糖厂里，生产过程大都是半自动化的，工人在各种颜色的指示仪器的指示下进行生产。今年，黑龙江省还开始着手筹划建设其它新的糖厂。
    今年黑龙江省糖的年产量已较一九四九年增加八倍，占全国机器制糖总产量的百分之四十左右。阿城糖厂所生产的雪花牌棉糖，糖粒干净整齐，颜色洁白有光泽，久放不发潮不发黄，深受北京、上海、天津等大城市的消费者欢迎。一般在结晶罐里熬糖需四小时，而阿城糖厂工人初登高由于掌握得好只需三小时，而且出的糖粒子还特别均匀整齐。全省各糖厂生产期亦由三个月延长到六个月，达到了甜菜糖生产期较高的水平。
    还可以提高一步
    今年全省甜菜普遍丰收，一般可比去年增产百分之十左右，但是除了讷河等地外，甜菜的含糖率还很低。阿城糖厂和和平糖厂所用的甜菜，每百斤只含糖十三斤左右，比过去的约降低了二斤到三斤。我们以一个每日消耗千吨甜菜的糖厂为例，只要每百斤甜菜含糖率提高一斤，全年就可为国家增加财富近一百三十亿元。在单位面积的产量方面，在苏联每公顷产量一般可达三十吨左右，而黑龙江省今年一般仅达十二吨左右。去年黑龙江省宁安县三合村生产合作社创造了每公顷收三十二吨的丰产纪录，这说明提高单位面积产量的可能是极大的。
    制糖过程中的浪费也是值得注意的。例如阿城糖厂的糖分的损失率仅百分之二点七左右，而别的糖厂，如哈尔滨糖厂的损失率要达百分之三点五到百分之四。这说明了，只要工人、农民努力改进技术，还可以给国家和人民生产许多白糖，可以给国家积累更多的财富。
