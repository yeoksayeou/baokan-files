Xinhua News Agency, December 25th. People in many cities, including Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Zhengzhou, and Taiyuan, have recently held rallies to oppose the US-Chiang Kai-shek treaty. People from all walks of life have expressed their determination to intensify their work and support the liberation of Taiwan.

    More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in Xiamen City, on the front line of national defense, held a conference on the afternoon of the 23rd. At the meeting, representatives of the Xiamen Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China gave a report on the US-Chiang Kai-shek "Mutual Defense Treaty" and the current situation. Wang Yanan, a representative of the National People's Congress and president of Xiamen University, as well as representatives from local organizations of various democratic parties in Xiamen, representatives from various people's organizations, and representatives of returned overseas Chinese, all spoke at the meeting. They unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement and angrily condemned the US-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty. During the conference, employees of the "Kaixuan" (Triumphant) ship, which had been strafed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, as well as the Xiamen Seamen's Association, dockworkers, farmers, and the Xiamen Port People's Self-Defense Forces, presented letters of determination to the conference. The letters of determination stated that they would guarantee to heighten vigilance, strengthen unity, and use their work achievements to resolutely support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

    On the evening of the 22nd, more than 1,200 workers in Fuzhou City held a conference. At the meeting, the workers unanimously denounced the US-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty. Zhang Qiushui, an outstanding driver from the Fuzhou Automobile Maintenance Plant, reported to the conference on behalf of all the workers: After the publication of the joint declaration for the liberation of Taiwan, we have saved the country 4.7 billion yuan in funds and completed the annual production task 27 days ahead of schedule. In the future, we will learn from the example of the iron and steel transportation soldiers of the Volunteer Army and be ready to fully support the front line at any time. Dong Lanjin, a female dockworker, said on behalf of all the dockworkers in the city: We dockworkers guarantee to stick to our posts, complete production targets, and support the front line; everyone will be present, and every vehicle will be available.

    At a conference of more than 1,400 people from all walks of life in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, Qian Nianwen, vice chairman of the Ningbo Municipal Consultative Committee, said angrily: The people of Ningbo, who are on the front line of national defense, will not forget the bloody debt of the indiscriminate bombing by US-Chiang Kai-shek planes in 1949 and the persecution of the coastal people. We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement and firmly oppose the US-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty.

    On the morning of the 24th, people from all walks of life in Henan Province and Zhengzhou City held a forum. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously agreed that the US-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty could only arouse the unparalleled indignation of the Chinese people and further strengthen their determination to liberate Taiwan. They said: The people of Henan Province, who suffered deeply during the Kuomintang rule and the occupation by Japanese militarists, know particularly well what means should be used to deal with the enemies of the people and the aggressors.

    Workers from the Taiyuan Leather Factory, all the workers from the second workshop of the Taiyuan Flour Factory, and construction workers, railway workers, and others from other units in Taiyuan City held meetings to discuss the issue of supporting the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions. Members of the Xiangyang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Taiyuan City have decided to sell another 100,000 jin of surplus grain to the state after selling 250,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

    More than 5,000 people from all walks of life in Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, held a conference in heavy snow. Zhang Wenchun, a representative of the National People's Congress and director of the Huochetou (Train Head) Agricultural Production Cooperative, said at the meeting: We have not forgotten the suffering we endured during the fourteen years of Japanese imperialism's occupation of Northeast China. Now that US imperialism wants to retrace the old path of Japan's aggression against China, this is something that we farmers, who have already become masters of the country, can never agree to.
