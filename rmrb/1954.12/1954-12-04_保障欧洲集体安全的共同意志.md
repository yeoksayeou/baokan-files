    Common Will to Guarantee European Collective Security
    By our correspondent Li He
    The European countries' conference to guarantee European peace and security completed its work successfully in Moscow today. In the morning, the delegations from the participating countries discussed and unanimously adopted the joint declaration of the governments of the Soviet Socialist Republics Union, the People's Republic of Poland , the Czechoslovak Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic, the Romanian People’s Republic ,the People' Republic of Bulgaria and the People’s Republic of Albania. At six o'clock in the afternoon, a grand ceremony was held in the Kremlin to sign the solemn joint declaration. The entire conference fully demonstrated the common will and strength of the European peace-loving countries, united in preventing the revival of West German militarism and defending European peace and security.
    The work completed by this conference, which is in line with the wishes of European peace-loving countries and peoples, and the enormous impact it has had and will continue to have on the European situation, shows that the conference was very timely and necessary. The significance of the conference was not diminished by the non-participation of some countries and the refusal of others to participate. On the contrary, the conference, with its profound analysis of the ratification of the Paris Agreements and the resulting unrest in Europe, greatly heightened the vigilance of European countries and peoples and powerfully struck at the United States aggressive bloc's conspiracy to revive West German militarism and create a new war in Europe. The conference clearly pointed out the correct path to solving the German question and establishing European collective security, and wisely decided on the defensive measures that should be taken against possible aggression if the Paris Agreements were ratified.
    As pointed out in the joint declaration adopted today: The ratification of the Paris Agreements will turn rearmed West Germany into a dangerous source of a new war in Europe, hinder Germany's reunification on a peaceful and democratic basis, and increase the threat to the people of all European countries. The United States ruling bloc is counting on the revival of German militarism in order to use these new Hitlerites as the main force in its aggression against Europe. Therefore, the Paris Agreements allow German revanchists to build a regular army of 500,000 in the near future, commanded by former Hitler generals, and to use atomic weapons. Before the Second World War, the Hitler gang, with the connivance and encouragement of the ruling groups of the United States, Britain and France, eventually brought unprecedented catastrophe to mankind. The people of all European countries, who have experienced the pain, cannot allow this history to repeat itself. However, the Paris Agreements prove that the United States ruling bloc wants to push the people of all European countries into the abyss of war and suffering again. Therefore, this European countries' conference to guarantee European peace and security is in line with the vital interests of the people of all European countries. Truly peace-loving European countries and peoples will certainly more actively oppose the ratification of the criminal Paris Agreements.
    Since the Paris Agreements are a key step in the United States ruling bloc's aggressive plans that endanger European peace and security, the attitude towards the ratification of the Paris Agreements is the yardstick for measuring the attitude of European countries towards war and peace. The joint declaration issued a solemn warning to European countries: The governments of the European countries participating in this conference consider it their duty to draw the attention of all European countries, especially those participating in the Paris Agreements, to the fact that ratification of the Paris Agreements would be an act against maintaining peace and preparing for a new war in Europe.
    At this conference, the delegates of various countries cited the historical experience before the World War to illustrate that if the ruling groups of Britain, France, and other Western European countries stubbornly pursue the United States' aggressive and war policy and help German militarization, they will inevitably "lift a rock only to drop it on their own feet" and suffer the consequences. The Soviet Union and the People's Democracies are now unprecedentedly strong, and they are not intimidated by the United States aggressive bloc's "strength" policy. If the United States aggressive bloc stubbornly persists in its policy of reviving West German militarism and creating a new war, a fate more miserable than that of the Hitler gang awaits them.
    Judging from the joint declaration issued today, if the aforementioned Western countries can change their attitude and sincerely seek European peace and security and resolve the German question on a peaceful and democratic basis, then these issues can still be discussed and resolved. However, if the Paris Agreements are ratified after all, then peace-loving countries must take the measures determined in the joint declaration to ensure their own security. The joint declaration states: "They are determined to take joint measures in organizing armed forces and command headquarters if the Paris Agreements are ratified after all, and also to take other measures necessary to strengthen their national defense forces to ensure the peaceful labor of their people, to guarantee the inviolability of their borders, and to ensure repelling possible aggression."
    The countries participating in this conference expressed in the joint declaration their complete agreement with the principles of the "draft treaty on European collective security of the entire Europe" proposed by the Soviet Union, "Therefore, they are determined to continue to insist on establishing a collective security system in Europe." The future development of the European situation must be closely watched. Therefore, "The countries participating in this conference agreed: If the Paris Agreements are ratified, they will re-examine the situation in order to take all necessary measures to ensure their own security and maintain European peace."
    When the joint declaration was adopted, Zhang Wentian, the representative of the People's Republic of China, in the capacity of observer, stated that the People's Republic of China fully agreed with this declaration and resolutely supported the propositions put forward in the declaration.
    We Chinese people are not only concerned about peace in Asia, but also about peace in Europe. "The struggle against the rearmament of West Germany and Japan has become a common task of all peace-loving people" (Communique of the meeting between the Premiers of China and Germany on July 25 this year). We Chinese people attach importance to the achievements of this Moscow conference and closely watch the development of the European situation. December 2nd

### 保障欧洲集体安全的共同意志

    保障欧洲集体安全的共同意志
    本报记者　李何
    保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家会议，今天在莫斯科圆满地完成工作。上午参加会议的各国代表团讨论了和一致通过了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府的联合宣言。下午六时在克里姆林宫举行了在庄严的联合宣言上签字的隆重仪式。整个会议充分地表现了欧洲爱好和平的国家团结一致地阻止西德军国主义复活和保卫欧洲和平和安全的共同意志和力量。
    这次符合欧洲爱好和平的国家和人民的愿望的会议所完成的工作，它在欧洲形势中所发生和继续会发生的巨大影响，说明会议是非常及时和必要的。会议并没有因为某些国家的没有参加和另外一些国家的拒绝参加而减少自己的意义。相反的，会议以对巴黎协定的批准和它所引起的欧洲不安局势的深刻分析，大大提高了欧洲国家和人民的警惕性，有力地打击了美国侵略集团复活西德军国主义和制造欧洲新战争的阴谋。会议清楚地指出了解决德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全的正确道路，明智地决定了如果巴黎协定被批准时应采取可能被侵略的防御措施。
    正如今天通过的联合宣言中指出的：巴黎协定的批准，将会使重新武装起来的西德变成欧洲新战争的危险策源地，阻碍德国在和平和民主的基础上恢复统一，增加对欧洲各国人民的威胁。美国统治集团是指望德国军国主义的复活，以便以这些新的希特勒分子为它侵略欧洲的主力。因此，巴黎协定允许德国复仇主义者在最近期间建立五十万正规军队，这些军队由前希特勒的将领指挥，并且可以使用原子武器。第二次世界大战以前，希特勒匪帮由于美英法统治集团的纵容和鼓励，最后带给人类以空前的浩劫，身历惨痛的欧洲各国人民是不能让这一历史重演的。但巴黎协定却证明，美国统治集团想把欧洲各国人民再推到战争苦难深渊中去。因此这次保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家会议，是符合欧洲各国人民的切身利益的。真正爱好和平的欧洲国家和人民，一定会更加积极地反对批准罪恶的巴黎协定的。
    巴黎协定既然是美国统治集团侵略计划中危害欧洲和平和安全的关键的一着，因此对待巴黎协定的批准的态度，是衡量欧洲国家对战争和和平的态度的尺度。联合宣言向欧洲国家提出严正的警告说：参加这次会议的欧洲国家的政府，认为自己有义务来促使所有欧洲国家，特别是参加巴黎协定的国家注意：批准巴黎协定将是一种反对维护和平和准备新的欧洲战争的行为。
    在这次会议上，各国代表引证了世界大战前的历史经验，说明如果英法和其他西欧国家的统治集团执迷不悟地追随美国的侵略和战争政策，帮助德国军国主义化，难免又是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，自食恶果。苏联和人民民主国家现在空前的壮大，他们不受美国侵略集团的“实力”政策的恫吓。如果美国侵略集团一意孤行复活西德军国主义和制造新战争的方针，比希特勒匪帮更悲惨的命运在等待他们。
    从今天发表的联合宣言看来，如果上述那些西方国家能转变态度，诚意地谋取欧洲和平和安全，在和平民主的基础上解决德国问题，那么这些问题还是可以商量和解决的。但是，如果巴黎协定竟然得到批准，那么爱好和平的国家，就必须采取联合宣言中所决定的措施，以保障自身的安全。联合宣言中说：“它们具有决心在巴黎协定竟然批准时在组织武装力量和司令部方面采取共同措施，并且还要采取加强它们国防力量所必须的其他措施，以保障它们人民的和平劳动，保证它们国境的不可侵犯性，保证击退可能发生的侵略。”
    参加这次会议的各国在联合宣言中表示了完全同意苏联所提的“关于欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的草案的原则，“因此，它们具有决心继续坚持在欧洲建立集体安全体系。”欧洲局势今后的发展是必须密切注视的。因此，“参加这次会议的国家议定：如果巴黎协定被批准，它们将再度研究局势，以便采取一切必要措施保障自身安全并维持欧洲和平。”
    在通过联合宣言的时候，中华人民共和国代表张闻天，以观察员的身份，声明中华人民共和国完全同意这一宣言，坚决支持宣言中所提出的主张。
    我们中国人民不仅关心亚洲和平，也关心欧洲和平。“反对重新武装西德和日本的斗争，成了所有爱好和平人民的共同任务”（今年七月二十五日中德两国总理会谈公报）。我们中国人民重视这次莫斯科会议的成就，同时密切地注视欧洲局势的发展。　十二月二日
