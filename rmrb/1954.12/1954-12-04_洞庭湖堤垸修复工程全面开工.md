The massive project to restore embankments around Dongting Lake in Hunan Province fully commenced on December 1st. Over 400,000 laborers are working along the 7,000-li (3500 km) long dike line. In the three key projects, the West Dongting Lake area and the Datong Lake area have basically completed clearing and obstacle removal work and entered the earthwork stage. For the blocking project at the Ma River upper mouth of the Li River floodway, all 100-plus wooden piles have been driven, and earth filling has begun. The South Dongting Lake area started earlier and has completed more than 500,000 cubic meters of earthwork. The self-repair projects in various counties have also started. Recently, the weather has gradually turned cold, with wind and rain alternating in the lake area. However, thanks to the preparations for cold and rain protection, the laborers are still persevering in construction day and night. (Our Hunan Reporter Station)

    洞庭湖堤垸修复工程全面开工
    湖南省修复洞庭湖堤垸的浩大工程，已于十二月一日全面开工。四十多万民工活动在七千里长的堤线上。三个重点工程中的西洞庭湖区和大通湖区，已基本上完成了清基扫障工作，进入土方工程；澧水洪道的麻河上口堵口工程，一百多根木桩已全部打好，开始填土。南洞庭湖区开工较早，已完成土方五十多万公方。各县的自修民垸，也都已开工。近来天气渐冷，滨湖地区风雨交加，民工们由于做好了防寒防雨的准备工作，仍日夜坚持施工。（本报湖南记者站）
