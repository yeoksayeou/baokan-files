Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Joint Defense Treaty" fully expresses the firm will of the people and students of the whole country to liberate Taiwan, oppose aggression, and defend peace. The students of the whole country fully support and endorse it.

The US-Chiang "Joint Defense Treaty" is a treaty that attempts to permanently occupy our territory of Taiwan by armed force, expand aggression, and prepare for a new war. This treaty is bound to create new tensions in the Far East and will bring even more profound disasters to the people and young students of Taiwan who are in dire straits. The students of the whole country express infinite indignation at the despicable and evil deeds of the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and express deep concern and support for the people and students of Taiwan who are temporarily under the bloody rule of the Chiang bandits.

Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chiang bandits are the mortal enemies of the Chinese people. Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is to defend the integrity of our territory and to defend peace in Asia and the world. This not only conforms to the interests of the Chinese people, but also to the interests of the people of Asia and the whole world. The students of the whole country resolutely oppose the US-Chiang "Joint Defense Treaty" and will prepare to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and contribute our strength to the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions of studying hard, actively exercising, and raising socialist awareness.

    全国学生联合会负责人的谈话
    周恩来外长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，充分表达了全国人民和学生解放台湾、反对侵略、保卫和平的坚强意志，我全国学生表示完全拥护和支持。
    美蒋“共同防御条约”是一个企图永远武装占领我国领土台湾、扩大侵略、准备新战争的条约。这个条约势必在远东造成新的紧张局势，并将给处在水深火热中的台湾人民和青年学生带来更加深重的灾难。我全国学生对美国政府和蒋介石卖国集团这种卑鄙的罪恶勾当，表示无限的愤慨，对暂时还处在蒋贼血腥统治下的台湾人民和学生，表示深切的关怀和支持。
    台湾是中国的领土，蒋贼是中国人民的死敌。解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，是为了保卫我国领土的完整，为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平，这不仅符合我国人民的利益，也符合亚洲和全世界人民的利益。我全国学生坚决反对美蒋“共同防御条约”，并将以努力学习，积极锻炼身体，提高社会主义觉悟的实际行动，来准备随时响应祖国的号召，为解放台湾贡献出自己的力量。　（新华社）
