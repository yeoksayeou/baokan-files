	Millennium Stone Gorge Opened Today
	——Qinghai-Tibet Highway Communication
	Shao Changxing
	The Qinghai-Tibet Highway construction army is making rapid progress. After opening to traffic at Heihe on November 16th, they crossed the Qiangtang Grassland and advanced the highway by 260 kilometers in half a month. On December 2nd, the construction army arrived at the Stone Gorge of the Gangdise Mountains, which stretches for ten kilometers.

	Looking at this Stone Gorge, towering mountains enclose a deep ravine, with large and small stones strewn across the steep cliffs. The large ones resemble reclining tigers, while the small ones look like crouching calves. Horses and camels passing through here could easily be tripped by the stones and fall into the ravine. The Qinghai-Tibet Highway must pass through here.

	Splitting the Stone Gorge and opening the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, this extremely arduous task fell on the shoulders of a certain unit of the PLA engineering corps participating in the construction. After the task was determined, the construction headquarters received a large number of pledges and guarantees. The engineers guaranteed to open the Stone Gorge and build the highway within ten days, so that cars could travel directly from Lhasa to Beijing via the Northwest. The Tibetan people living near the Stone Gorge, hearing that a smooth road was to be built in the rocky gully, immediately prepared sufficient fuel to support their engineers.

	On the morning of the 3rd, construction began simultaneously along the ten-kilometer-long Stone Gorge site. Once this mechanized engineering unit with a glorious history went into action, the desolate valley suddenly became a hive of activity. The motor sound of the air compressor drowned out the sound of the rushing water in the ravine, and the loud sound of blasting stone echoed through the mountains. Wild wolves and foxes, who had lived in this valley since ancient times, were frightened and scurried around everywhere. At night, the engineers called the moon a "sky lamp," and under the "sky lamp" they lit torches, and the comrades on the night shift continued to work as usual. At this time, the rock drills were drilling holes in the hard rocks, and sparks flew up high. In the second half of the night, the weather became even colder, and the temperature dropped to below ten degrees Celsius. The joints of the air compressor hoses were often frozen. Wei Chunjiang and Zhong Jinhua came up with a way to bake them with flamethrowers to ensure that the machinery could operate normally in the severe cold. Communist Party members Chen Youyun, Li Dacheng and other comrades jointly came up with an idea to double the efficiency of the air compressor. Where the machinery was not convenient to operate, the engineers fought the rocks with sledgehammers and steel chisels. Youth League member Wang Dexiao struck six hundred and ten blows in one breath, and everyone on the construction site praised him and learned from him. Many people's hands were blistered with blood, but they still insisted on working and refused to stop. The engineers attacked the Stone Gorge so heroically, filled with the confidence of victory. A poem wrote: "People's engineers, men of steel, faces glowing red, reflecting the plateau, sledgehammers raised, the mountains tremble, the millennium Stone Gorge opens today."

	At noon on December 12th, the sun shone golden yellow over the mountains and valleys. A highway appeared in the winding Stone Gorge. The heroic engineering unit fulfilled its promise on time and ensured safe construction, eliminating casualties. They proudly wrote fourteen large characters on the cliff: Cross the Kunlun Tanggula, open the Stone Gorge to Lhasa.

	As soon as the highway was built, Tibetan merchants drove their packhorses through the Stone Gorge. They smiled and kept giving thumbs up to the road-building troops to express their gratitude and admiration, no longer having to walk this dangerous road with trepidation as before. Convoys of trucks loaded with supplies also drove past one after another, and the Tibetan people along the way applauded as they watched these novel vehicles.

	The road-building laborers on the Lhasa plain, hearing the victorious news of the engineering unit splitting the Stone Gorge, further improved their road-building efficiency. At 2:00 p.m. on December 15th, the entire Qinghai-Tibet Highway was completed.

    千年石峡今日开
    ——青藏公路通讯
    邵长兴
    青藏公路筑路大军进展神速。十一月十六日通车黑河后，半个月的时间又跨越羌塘草原，把公路推进二百六十公里。十二月二日这一天，筑路大军来到冈底斯山脉长达十公里的石峡跟前。
    看这石峡，耸峻的山峰，夹着一条深深的涧水，在陡削的崖壁上，摆满了大大小小的石块。大的好像一只只横卧着的猛虎，小的好像蜷伏着的牛犊。马匹、骆驼从这路过，很容易被石头绊倒摔到涧下去。青藏公路必须由这里通过。
    劈开石峡，打通青藏公路，这项十分艰巨的任务，落在参加筑路的中国人民解放军工兵部队某部的肩上。任务确定下来后，筑路指挥部接到了大批决心书和保证书。工兵们保证在十天内打通石峡，修好公路，让汽车从拉萨经西北地区可以直通北京。住在石峡附近的藏族人民，听到要在乱石沟中修筑一条平坦大道，马上准备了充足的燃料，支援自己的工兵。
    三日早晨，沿着石峡十公里长的工地同时动工了。这支有着光荣历史的机械化工兵部队，一经动作，荒凉的山谷顿时热火朝天。空气压缩机的马达声，压低了涧下急湍的流水声，爆破石方的巨响，使群山都发出回音。从古以来就在这山谷里住着的野狼和狐狸，吓的到处乱窜。夜晚，工兵们把月亮叫作“天灯”，在“天灯”下面再点起火把，夜班的同志照样工作。这时候，石钻机在坚硬的岩石上钻孔，火星子冒起多高。后半夜，天气更冷了，气温降低到零下十几度。空气压缩机气管子的接头常常被冻住。魏纯江、钟金华就想办法用喷火器烤，保证机械在严寒中照常开动。共产党员陈有云，李大成和其他同志共同出主意，使空气压缩机的效率提高一倍。在机械施展不灵便的地方，工兵们就用铁锤钢钎和岩石作斗争。青年团员王德孝一口气连打六百一十锤，工地上人人传颂，个个都向他学习。许多人的手磨起了血泡，仍然坚持工作不肯停歇。工兵们就这样英勇地向石峡进攻，他们满怀着必胜的信心。有一首诗写道：“人民工兵钢铁汉，脸上红光映高原，铁锤举起山发颤，千年石峡今日开。”
    十二月十二日中午，太阳把满山满谷照得黄澄澄的。在弯弯曲曲的石峡里，出现了一条公路。英雄的工兵部队，准时实现了自己的诺言，并且作到了安全施工，消灭了伤亡事故。他们自豪地在削壁上写下十四个大字：跨过昆仑唐古拉，开劈石峡通拉萨。
    公路刚一筑成，就有藏族商人赶着马驮从石峡通过，他们笑呵呵地不断伸出大拇指向筑路部队表示感谢和钦佩，再也不必像以前那样提心吊胆地走这段险路了。满载着物资的汽车队，也一辆辆地开过去，沿路的藏族人民看着这些新奇的车辆，连连地鼓掌。
    在拉萨平原上的筑路民工们，听到工兵部队劈开石峡的胜利消息，筑路效率更加提高。十二月十五日下午二时，青藏公路全线修通了。
