    Develop Sideline Production in Disaster Areas
    Lu Qi
    Currently, the most urgent demand of the broad masses of people in areas affected by floods is to develop sideline production and strive to eliminate the disaster before the spring famine. Years of disaster relief experience have all proven that doing a good job in winter sideline production has a decisive effect on solving the problem of food shortages for disaster victims and reducing the spring famine next year.
    Sideline production in some disaster areas has been developed relatively well. For example, in Hebei Province, more than 2.7 million people participated in more than 60 kinds of sideline and handicraft production. Tianjin Prefecture, which suffered the most severe disaster, developed sideline production, and the average daily sideline income of disaster victims in the entire prefecture reached 2 billion yuan. The enthusiasm of disaster victims for production is high, and their confidence in overcoming the disaster is great.
    However, in contrast to the above situation, sideline production in some disaster areas has not been developed. Cadres in these areas are busy with other "central tasks" and have relaxed their leadership over sideline production. The masses are waiting for the government to find solutions and are not looking for ways to produce themselves. This situation must be quickly changed, otherwise, a small disaster may develop into a large disaster, and a light disaster may develop into a heavy disaster.
    Sideline production is commodity production, production for sale. In order to develop sideline production, there must be a practical and feasible plan. It is necessary not only to help disaster victims find production opportunities, but also to be responsible for solving the problems of raw materials, sales channels, and technology required for developing sidelines. Economic departments must closely cooperate with and strongly support sideline production in disaster-stricken areas. At present, some areas lack overall planning in the allocation of raw materials, resulting in imbalanced supply, so that some major sidelines cannot be developed; in some areas, things produced by disaster victims are not purchased or purchased too little, resulting in a large number of unsold goods. These should be quickly addressed.

    开展灾区副业生产
    鲁启
    目前，遭受水灾地区的广大人民最迫切的要求，是开展副业生产，力争把灾荒消灭在春荒以前。历年救灾经验全都证明：冬季副业生产作得好，对解决灾民缺乏口粮的困难和缩小明年的春荒，都有决定性的作用。
    有些灾区的副业生产开展得是比较好的。例如，河北省有二百七十多万人，参加了六十多种副业和手工业生产。灾情最重的天津专区开展了副业生产，全区灾民副业收入每天平均达二十亿元。灾民生产情绪高涨，战胜灾荒的信心很大。
    但是，和上面这种情形相反，有些灾区的副业生产并没有开展起来。这些地区的干部忙于其他“中心工作”，放松了对于副业生产的领导。群众坐等政府想办法，自己不去寻找生产门路。必须把这种情况迅速转变过来，否则，小灾可能发展成大灾，轻灾可能发展成重灾。
    副业生产是商品生产，是为出卖而生产的。为了开展副业生产，必须有一个切实可行的计划。不仅帮助灾民找到生产门路，而且负责解决开展副业所需要的原料、销路、技术等问题。经济部门要密切配合和大力支持受灾地区的副业生产。现在有的地区在原料调配方面缺乏通盘打算，供应失调，以致某些大宗副业无法开展；有的地区灾民生产出来的东西无人收购或收购太少，产生了大量滞销的现象。这些都应迅速设法克服。
