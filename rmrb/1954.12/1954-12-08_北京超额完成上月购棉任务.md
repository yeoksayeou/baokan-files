Beijing Overfulfills Last Month's Cotton Purchase Task

The Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation purchased 1.42 million jin of seed cotton in November, fulfilling 104% of the monthly plan. Cotton farmers in the suburbs of Beijing warmly support the policy of unified cotton purchase. The Red Star Collective Farm and eighteen agricultural production cooperatives including the Jingcai, Tuanhe, and Huayuan cooperatives alone have already sold more than 200,000 jin of cotton to the state. The Jingcai Agricultural Production Cooperative sold more than 6,800 jin of cotton to the state and also cleared 6 million yuan in advance purchase deposits. Cotton farmers like Li Siqi retained little or no cotton for personal use, selling more cotton to the state to support national economic construction. (Feng Da)

    北京超额完成上月购棉任务
    北京市供销合作总社十一月份收购籽棉一百四十二万斤，完成月计划百分之一百零四。北京市郊区棉农热烈拥护棉花统购政策。仅红星集体农庄和竞赛、团河、花园等十八个农业生产合作社，就已经卖给国家二十多万斤棉花。竞赛农业生产合作社卖给国家六千八百多斤棉花，并还清了六百万元预购定金。棉农李思奇等都少留或不留自用棉，把更多的棉花卖给国家，支援国家经济建设。（冯达）
