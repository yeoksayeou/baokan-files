    Tong County Employs Accounting Station Format to Train Agricultural Production Cooperative Accountants
    Hebei Province's Tong County, through the method of accounting stations to train accountants, gradually solved the problem of the lack of accountants and the lack of skilled accountants in agricultural production cooperatives. Tong County has established more than forty accounting stations, with a total of more than three hundred and eighty accountants participating in the study. After a short period of study, many people have become familiar with their business. Of the original thirty-nine accountants in District One of the county, after collective study at the accounting station, most have learned to keep accounts and transfer accounts. In the past, some accountants only kept accounts and did not manage the finances of the cooperatives. After learning, many accountants understood the importance of financial management work and the relationship between accounting and financial management.
    The organization of the accounting station is as follows: more skilled accountants serve as the head and deputy head of the station, responsible for leading the accountants of agricultural production cooperatives within five or six *li* nearby. They study once every ten days or half a month, and the learning content includes accounting methods, financial management, and income distribution. During the study, the accountants of each cooperative bring the draft accounts recorded in the previous stage to the station, check each other, correct errors, and then copy them to the formal ledgers. If new problems are discovered at this time, they will be discussed to find a solution. At the same time, communication relations have also been established between stations to frequently exchange experience.

    通县运用会计站的形式
    训练农业生产合作社会计
    河北省通县通过会计站训练会计的办法，逐渐解决了农业生产合作社中无会计和缺乏熟练会计的问题。通县共已建立四十多个会计站，参加学习的会计共有三百八十多人，他们经过短期学习，许多人都熟悉了自己的业务，该县一区原有的三十九名会计，经过会计站集体学习，大部已学会了记账和转账。过去有些会计只管记账，不管社的财务管理，经过学习，许多会计都懂得了财务管理工作的重要性，和会计与财务管理的关系。
    会计站的组织是这样的：由较熟练的会计担任站长和副站长，负责领导附近五、六里地以内农业生产合作社的会计。他们每隔十天或半月学习一次，学习内容包括记账方法、财务管理、收益分配等。在学习时，各社会计将前一阶段记的草账带到站上，互相检查，纠正错误，然后再往正式账簿上誊写，如果这时发现了新问题，就展开讨论，求得解决。同时，站和站之间也建立了通讯关系，经常交流经验。
