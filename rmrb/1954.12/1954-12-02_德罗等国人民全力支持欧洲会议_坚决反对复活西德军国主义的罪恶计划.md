Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: Berlin dispatch: "Hamburger Volkszeitung," the organ of the German Communist Party, wrote in a commentary on the Moscow Conference: The clamor of Western countries that support the war treaty shows how necessary a people's conference is to reverse or stop the dangers caused by this treaty.

Gertrude Sass, a model teacher from the German Democratic Republic, said that she believes that the Moscow Conference will promote the great struggle of the people to defend peace. She said: "Our responsibility is to do everything possible to strive for Germany's unity and peace. No one can hesitate any longer, otherwise, history will be his judge."

The Erfurt District Conference of the National Democratic Party of Democratic Germany sent a congratulatory telegram to the Moscow Conference. The participants in the conference guaranteed in the telegram: They will never retreat in the face of the task of striving for Germany's unity and opposing the Paris Agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: Bucharest dispatch: Romanian newspapers have published many articles and letters from people of various professions and political beliefs in recent days. These articles and letters unanimously angrily condemn the plan to revive German militarism and support the Romanian government's participation in the Moscow Conference.

Reserve General Atanasiu, who participated in the war against the German aggressors, wrote: Europe must not take the path of reviving the German "Wehrmacht." The only path that does not violate the interests of the European people is to establish a European collective security organization.

Meng Tiannu, chairman of a collective farm in Arad Oblast, said that we must not sit idly by and watch the danger of war. We should work with the Germans to thwart the danger of war as soon as it appears. Unity will bring victory.

Writer Soburu pointed out the concerns of peace-loving people about the new tensions and the threat to world peace. He said: But today the people are no longer ruled by a small group of dictators. They are expressing their will more and more strongly and demanding that their will be taken into account.
