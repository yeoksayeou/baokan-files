    Tractor Repair Plant Starts Production
    Heilongjiang Province's first new-type tractor repair plant began production at the end of November. This factory is basically designed according to the specifications of a large-scale Soviet repair plant, and it has all modern equipment. The first batch of tractors can be repaired by mid-December. This winter and spring (until before wheat sowing), the repair and assembly work of 40 tractors and farm implements that need major and medium repairs by tractor stations in northern Heilongjiang can be successfully completed.

    拖拉机修配厂开工生产
    黑龙江省第一个新型拖拉机修配厂在十一月底开工生产。这个厂基本上是按照苏联大型修配厂规格设计的，它有近代化的一切设备。十二月中旬，可修配完第一批拖拉机。今冬明春（至播麦前），黑龙江北部各县拖拉机站需要大修和中修的四十台拖拉机和农具的修配工作可以顺利完成。（冯焕东）
