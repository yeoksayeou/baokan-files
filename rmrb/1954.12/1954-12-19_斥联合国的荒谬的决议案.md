Under the manipulation and direction of the United States, the United Nations General Assembly hastily passed a so-called resolution "Accusing the Violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement in Detaining and Imprisoning United Nations Military Personnel" on December 10th. This resolution is utterly absurd and extremely shameful. It is a slander and interference in the Chinese government and the Chinese judiciary, and a mockery and destruction of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the United Nations Charter, and generally recognized principles of international law. It has long been said that the United Nations has become an affiliated agency of the U.S. State Department. This slanderous resolution against China further proves that the United States, through its manipulated voting machine, is continuing to use the United Nations as a tool to intensify the Cold War, create international tensions, interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and engage in espionage and subversive activities. This is truly a sad thing for the United Nations, which aims to "promote international peace and security"!

In the process of discussing this absurd and shameful "accusation case," U.S. Representative Lodge, British Representative Nutting, and representatives of many other countries have talked incessantly about many legal issues. This makes it necessary for us to expose and refute their distorted and ridiculous arguments from a purely legal point of view.

First of all, it should be pointed out that the passage of this resolution is procedurally illegal. When the United Nations discussed this motion, not only was there no representative of the People's Republic of China present, but also the People's Republic of China was not invited to attend at all. This resolution of the United Nations condemning China was passed entirely under one-sided circumstances, under the direction of the United States and its servant states. Indian representative Mr. Lall expressed dissatisfaction with this situation. He said: "Condemnation cannot be carried out without fully and fairly hearing opinions. Isn't this a basic and universal principle? Have we done this on this issue? Unfortunately, we have not!" He also said: "We have maintained the form of 'debate' here, but in fact we cannot proceed with the debate when one of the main parties is not participating." Secondly, because the United States was eager to pass this slander case, it forced the General Committee to submit it directly to the United Nations General Assembly after it was included in the agenda without review by the Special Political Committee. At the General Assembly, it immediately started its voting machine and passed a recommendation to immediately begin discussing the motion in the plenary session of the General Assembly without waiting for seven days after it was included in the agenda, as stipulated by the rules of procedure of the General Assembly. The reason why the U.S. government adopted this crude approach in violation of procedural rules is obviously because it has a "guilty conscience" and wants to quickly pass the motion in the United Nations General Assembly without sufficient discussion and without fully hearing opposing opinions.

This approach of the U.S. government was severely criticized by representatives from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. During the so-called "debate," although it mobilized the representatives of more than twenty servant states to parrot its weak reasons and arguments, it never put forward any convincing "evidence." Mr. Shukairy, the representative of Syria, expressed dissatisfaction on this point. He said: The United States has not provided evidence to prove that the captured flight personnel did not commit espionage. Mr. Shukairy's conclusion was: the sixteen-nation proposal is a "bad" proposal.

A "bad" proposal, once passed, is bound to be a "bad" resolution. This is the absurd and shameful resolution of the United Nations!

As Mr. Shukairy said, the United States has not presented any evidence to prove that the captured flight personnel did not commit espionage, but China can present a wealth of evidence - absolutely undeniable and completely convincing evidence to prove that these flight personnel did indeed commit espionage. Anyone who visits the "Exhibition of Evidence of U.S. Aerial Dropping of Secret Agents" currently being held in Beijing, and looks at the more than 15,000 pieces of documents and items seized from U.S. aerial-dropped secret agents, some of which were seized from Arnold and his ten companions and the plane they were on, or visits several villages more than 20 kilometers northwest of Andong City, Liaoning Province, China, to interview some farmers who witnessed and personally participated in the search and capture of Arnold, Baumer, and the other eleven American flight personnel, I believe that they will not feel a "lack of evidence" regarding the U.S.'s consistent espionage activities against China, where these eleven Americans arrived, and what their purpose was. If the United Nations were willing to invite Chinese representatives to attend and explain this case, I think the reason and conscience of some representatives would not be reduced to the point, as Mr. Shukairy said, of "not being able to judge the merits of the event."

What the United States is most afraid of is evidence. They are unwilling to "act according to the evidence," as Mr. Shukairy said. Throughout the entire process of proposing and discussing this so-called "accusation case," the U.S. representative never presented anything that could be called "evidence." He tried to present a forged so-called "radar record of aircraft routes," attempting to show that Arnold's plane was shot down south of the Yalu River. But later he withdrew it automatically, probably because the flight route map was not fabricated properly, and he was afraid that people would see through its flaws. Apart from this worthless "flight route map," he was never able to produce any evidence.

Since the United States cannot present any evidence, it has to resort to scolding and shouting, saying that the Chinese government violated the basic principles of international law, violated the minimum standards of international relations, violated the armistice agreement, and even dragged in the Hague Rules of Land Warfare and the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. This is entirely the trick of what the Chinese call "the thief crying 'stop thief'," which is not worth a laugh from the knowledgeable. However, because U.S. Representative Lodge and many representatives of servant states, especially the British representative Nutting, who is eager to please the United States, are happily playing these hackneyed tunes, we cannot but talk to them about these aspects and refute their fallacies.

What these representatives like to talk about most is international law, but I don’t believe they don’t know that one of the basic principles of international law is that a country has no right to send people to the territory of another country to engage in espionage activities. Another basic principle is that once people engaged in espionage activities are captured by the country where they are located, the capturing country has the full right to deal with them in accordance with its own domestic law. A third basic principle is that the sending country absolutely cannot come forward to interfere or give diplomatic protection regarding how the capturing country handles the spy.

Let us measure the case of Arnold et al. by these three most basic principles of international law regarding espionage. All evidence has proved that Arnold and the other eleven were sent by the United States to sneak into Chinese territory by plane to engage in espionage activities. They are active-duty personnel of the "581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing" serving the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, and the task of this wing is to "airdrop spies to the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries and to supply, pick up, and contact spies on the ground." They were captured in Chinese territory. The Chinese court tried them in accordance with Chinese law and sentenced them based on a separate Chinese criminal regulation (Regulations on the Punishment of Counter-Revolutionaries).

From these facts, what China has done is completely in accordance with international law, while what the United States has done is completely in violation of international law. It has no right to send spies to China, and it has no right to "protest" to China after those spies are arrested and sentenced. However, the U.S. government is not only unashamed of its own illegal crimes, but also dares to "protest" to the Chinese government and even coerce the United Nations to "condemn" China. I really don't know what international law they are based on!

Everyone knows that massively sending spies and secret agents to foreign countries to engage in reconnaissance, sabotage, and subversion activities has become part of U.S. national policy. The U.S. annually allocates 100 million U.S. dollars under the "Mutual Security Act" for espionage activities. The famous U.S. military commentator Hanson Baldwin wrote in "The New York Times": "For eight years, especially since the Korean War began in 1950, U.S. Air Force and Navy aircraft have flown along the borders of the Soviet Union, and have crossed these borders several times. They have been searching for intelligence of different natures, both positive and negative." He also said: "Several other U.S. aircraft probably deliberately entered the aerial borders of other countries. The missions of these aircraft may be called espionage activities, which are different from the routine and continuous reconnaissance flights made over the high seas and the territories of friendly countries. In this way, special personnel can be dropped by parachute, and photographic or electronic recording work can be carried out over the territories of other countries." Baldwin's report is of course accurate, but he deliberately avoids saying that there are only "several" American aircraft. In fact, the United States has at least three air force regiments that specialize in such espionage activities. In the past four years, more than 200 secret agents airdropped by them in China have been captured and eliminated by the Chinese public security authorities.

The United Nations has never dared to criticize even a word against a government like the United States, which openly and massively engages in foreign espionage activities and elevates espionage activities to the level of national policy, but the United Nations wants to "accuse" and "condemn" the Chinese government, which has captured and legally sentenced eleven such spies in its own territory. How absurd is this! May I ask: Where is the dignity of the United Nations?

The U.S. representative to the United Nations and the representatives of those servant states also know that the capturing country can punish the captured spies in accordance with its own domestic law. So, they insist that Arnold and others are not spies. Their only "argument" is that these people are wearing military uniforms and are not "disguised." Throughout the entire discussion process, those representatives repeatedly emphasized this "argument."

There is no doubt that their argument comes from the Hague Rules of Land Warfare. Because according to Article 29 of that rule, "disguise" ("masquerade," "modification") is a condition for constituting espionage.

Let alone the fact that Article 29 of the Hague Rules does not stipulate that "disguise" is an absolutely necessary condition for espionage, because even if not disguised, using "deceptive means" ("false pretenses") to enter the war zone of a belligerent country to engage in reconnaissance, according to the provisions of that article, can also constitute espionage. What we want to emphasize is that the Hague Rules of Land Warfare and the case of China sentencing American spies have nothing to do with each other. The Chinese court applied completely Chinese domestic law - a separate criminal regulation, not the Hague Rules of Land Warfare in this case. Whether from a strict legal point of view or from general common sense, the Hague Rules of Land Warfare are completely inapplicable to this case. Because: First, in the Korean War, China and the United States were not belligerent countries; second, these American spies were not captured in the "war zone" but in the suburbs west of Andong County, Chinese territory, which is not a "war zone." Under these circumstances, the Hague Rules applicable to the "enemy country" and "war zone" are completely irrelevant to this case. The Chinese court not only can but should apply its own domestic law.

When the Chinese court judges whether a criminal is a spy according to its own domestic law, it does not base it on the clothes he wears, but on the behavior he does and the intention and purpose of this behavior. Based on a large amount of reliable evidence, the Chinese court determined that Arnold and his group sneaked into Chinese territory by plane for the purpose of engaging in espionage activities and endangering China's security, and therefore treated them as having committed espionage crimes. This is entirely a matter of applying Chinese domestic law and has nothing to do with the Hague Rules of Land Warfare.

However, British representative Nutting, who is keen to please the United States, thought he had caught half a straw of the Hague Rules (the words "disguise"), and made a big fuss about it, putting on an angry face, pounding the table and shouting in the United Nations General Assembly, "Are eleven air force personnel wearing their national uniforms and riding in an airplane going to land on Chinese territory to engage in espionage activities?" He also said: "A spy would wear a kind of clothing - the military uniform of his own country, which would inevitably make it impossible for him to blend in with the residents of every place where he wants to conduct secret activities and subversive activities." Nutting's triumphant "argument" was repeated many times by other representatives in the United Nations General Assembly.

However, Nutting and others are obviously pretending to be naive. Everyone knows that modern espionage activities are different from the old ones, and it is not necessary to blend in with the "residents of the place" where he wants to conduct secret activities and subversive activities. To be honest, even if the eleven American flight personnel changed into casual clothes, formal clothes, clerical robes, or Chinese gentleman's clothes and farmer's clothes, they would not be too likely to "blend in" with the "local residents." However, a plane sneaking into another country can do a lot of espionage activities on its own. It can measure the terrain of the ground, it can observe the ground situation and listen to ground intelligence, it can take pictures, it can record sounds, it can use radio to contact spies on the ground, it can airdrop spies or drop weapons and supplies to support them, and what is more ingenious is that it can also use a device called "air retriever" to pick up spies who have been airdropped from the ground earlier. I think anyone who has visited the "Exhibition of Evidence of U.S. Aerial Dropping of Secret Agents" in Beijing and seen the various ingenious equipment they use will know that Nutting's claim that spies must "disguise" and "blend in...with local residents" is unfounded.

Since the U.S. representative to the United Nations and its followers dare not recognize spies as spies, then what are these people? They have to insist that they are "prisoners of war." From "prisoners of war," those representatives jumped to the "Korean Armistice Agreement." They said: According to Article 3 of the Armistice Agreement, all prisoners of war should have been released and repatriated before September 25, 1953, and China's failure to repatriate these people is a violation of the "Korean Armistice Agreement," is "illegal," and the Chinese court's "trial and conviction" of these people should be "condemned." This is the entire argument of those representatives in the United Nations, which is the main reason for the so-called "accusation case" proposed by the sixteen countries.

But this argument, this reason, whether from a legal or common sense point of view, is completely untenable! Because it involves the Korean Armistice Agreement, this makes it impossible for us not to talk about this agreement.

Indeed, according to Article 3 of the Korean Armistice Agreement, "all prisoners of war held by each side" should be "released and repatriated." But this article has nothing to do with the case of Arnold et al. The so-called "each side" in this article refers to the belligerent parties, that is, the parties who signed the agreement, namely the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on one side, and the United Nations Command on the other side. This interpretation has never been disputed, and the U.S. side has not raised any objections. According to this interpretation, then the so-called "all prisoners of war held by each side," on the Korean side, of course, refers to the prisoners of war held by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, which is very clear.

Are Arnold and the other eleven such "prisoners of war"? Answer: No! No! First of all, they are not "prisoners of war" but spies. They were not captured by the Korean People's Army or the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield, nor were they held by the Korean People's Army or the Chinese People's Volunteers, but were captured by Chinese farmers west of Andong City, Liaoning Province, China, and detained by Chinese public security organs. They were not captured while fighting or performing military missions on the Korean battlefield, but were caught while engaging in espionage activities in Chinese territory. These are two absolutely different situations. Therefore, it is very obvious that the provisions of Article 3 of the Korean Armistice Agreement are completely inapplicable to Arnold et al.

There is also a stranger argument among the representatives of the United Nations. They said: "The Armistice Agreement guarantees the exchange of known war criminals such as torturers, murderers, spies, and agitators." This statement is also unfounded. First of all, the Armistice Agreement does not have any provisions guaranteeing the repatriation of such people. According to Article 119 of the 1949 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, the holding country has the full right to detain them. In legal terms, any provisions for the repatriation of prisoners of war do not include such people. However, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, in order to show leniency, did send hundreds of such prisoners of war who had committed crimes to the other side, some of whom were "war criminals" in international law, and some of whom were criminals who committed evil deeds in prisoner-of-war camps. The situation of these people is completely different from the situation of Arnold et al. They were prisoners of war who were captured and held by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield; while Arnold et al. were spies who were captured by the Chinese people and detained by the Chinese public security organs while engaging in espionage activities in Chinese territory. They are neither prisoners of war nor war criminals. Although these two types of people have committed crimes, their legal status is completely different. It is already incorrect to say that the Korean Armistice Agreement guarantees the repatriation of all criminal prisoners of war; it is even more of a "nonsense" to say that the Korean Armistice Agreement should also include the repatriation of a group of people like Arnold et al.

But the U.S. representative and its echoes insisted that China violated the Korean Armistice Agreement, and therefore must be "accused" and "condemned." All their arguments are derived from such "nonsense." The gentlemen of the United Nations have always remained silent on the U.S.'s many serious violations of the Armistice Agreement and its detention of tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war; they want to conduct some "accusation" and some "condemnation" against the Chinese side, which has consistently strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement. This is what makes their resolution particularly absurd and shameful.

I remember that Australian representative Spender also put on a passionate look when the United Nations General Assembly discussed the Chinese sentencing of American spies, saying: If no action can be taken against China, this would be equivalent to "ringing the death knell" for the United Nations! Here, we want to solemnly tell Spender that it is the actions of the representatives of the United States and its accomplice countries that are "ringing the death knell" for the United Nations!

As for China, we have always been upholding world peace and international cooperation. However, we will definitely resolutely oppose and give a severe counterattack to the United States' crimes of infringing on our sovereignty, interfering in our internal affairs, and subverting our government. The so-called sixteen-nation proposal passed by the United Nations General Assembly is illegal and will never be valued by the Chinese people and all progressive mankind.

    斥联合国的荒谬的决议案
    中国政治法律学会理事
    前远东国际军事法庭法官  梅汝璈
    联合国大会十二月十日在美国的操纵和指使下，草率地通过了一个所谓“控诉违反朝鲜停战协定拘留和监禁联合国军事人员”的决议案。这个决议案是荒谬绝伦和十分可耻的。它是对中国政府和中国司法的诬蔑和干涉，也是对朝鲜停战协定、联合国宪章以及一般公认的国际法原则的嘲弄和破坏。早已有人说过，联合国已经变成了美国国务院的一个附属机构。这次诬蔑中国的决议案更证明了：美国通过它所操纵的表决机器还在继续利用联合国做为它加强冷战、制造国际紧张局势、干涉他国内政、从事间谍颠覆活动的工具。这对以“促进国际和平与安全”为宗旨的联合国说来，实在是一件可悲的事情！
    在这个荒谬可耻的“控诉案”的讨论过程中，美国代表洛奇、英国代表纳丁，以及其他许多国家的代表们曾经喋喋不休地谈论着许多法律问题，这就使我们有必要纯本法律的见地对他们歪曲可笑的论据加以揭穿和驳斥。
    首先，应该指出的是：这个决议案的通过在程序上是不合法的。联合国在讨论这个议案的时候，不但没有中华人民共和国的代表在场，而且也根本没有邀请中华人民共和国的代表到场。联合国这个谴责中国的决议案完全是在片面的情况下，由美国指使它的仆从国家所通过的。对于这种情况，印度代表拉尔先生曾表示不满。他说：“如果没有充分地和公正的听取意见，是不能进行谴责的。这不是一个基本的和普遍的原则吗？我们在这个问题上有没有这样做呢？不幸得很，并没有这样做！”又说：“我们在这里维持了‘辩论’的形式，但是事实上我们不能在主要当事人之一没有参加辩论的情形下进行。”其次，美国由于要赶忙把这个诬蔑案通过，它逼使总务委员会于通过列入议程以后不经过特别政治委员会的审查便直接提送联合国大会。在大会上，它又立刻开动了他的表决机器，通过了一项建议，那便是立即开始在大会全体会议上讨论这个议案而不必依照大会议事规则的规定，等到在它被列入议程七天以后再来讨论。美国政府所以要采取这种违反程序规则的粗暴作法显然是由于它
  “做贼心虚”，要赶快使这个议案在联合国大会不经充分讨论和不充分听取反对意见的情况下获得通过。
    美国政府的这种做法遭到了苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰等国代表的严厉抨击。在所谓“辩论”的过程中，它虽然动员了二十多个仆从国家的代表们鹦鹉学舌似地重复它那些无力的理由和论点，但始终提不出任何使人信服的“证据”。关于这一点，叙利亚的代表舒凯里先生就表示不满。他说：美国也没有提出证据可以证明它所说的被俘获的飞行人员没有犯间谍罪。舒凯里先生的结论是：十六国的提案是一个“坏”的提案。
    “坏”的提案，一旦被通过，必然是一个“坏”的决议。这便是联合国这个荒谬可耻的决议！
    正如舒凯里先生所说，美国也没有提出证据可以证明它所说的被俘获的飞行人员没有犯间谍罪，然而中国却可以提出大量证据——绝对无法抵赖和完全使人信服的证据，证明这些飞行人员确曾犯了间谍罪。任何人只要参观一下那个正在北京举行的
  “美国空投特务罪证展览会”，看看那一万五千多件由美国空投特务那里所搜获来的证件物品，其中有些是从阿诺德和他那十位同伴身上和他们所乘的飞机里所搜获来的，或者到中国辽宁省安东市西北二十多公里的某几个村庄去访问一些目睹的和亲自参加寻捕阿诺德、包莫等十一位美国飞行人员的农民们，我相信，他对于美国对中国一贯进行间谍活动的行为，以及这十一位美国人到达的是什么地方，他们来的目的何在，决不会觉着“缺乏证据”。假使联合国肯邀中国代表出席把这个案件说明一下，我想，一些代表们的理性和良知决不至于弄到像舒凯里先生所说的“不能判明事件的是非曲直”的地步。
    美国最骇怕的就是证据，他们决不愿像舒凯里先生所说“要根据证据办事”。在这个所谓“控诉案”的提出和讨论的整个过程中，美国代表始终没有提出过任何够得上称为“证据”的东西。他试图提出过一张伪造的所谓“雷达纪录的飞机航线图”，妄图说明阿诺德等的飞机是在鸭绿江以南被击落的。但是后来他又自动撤回了，原因大概是那张航线图还制造得不太妥贴，恐怕人家看穿它的破绽。除了这张一文不值的“航线图”之外，他始终不能提出任何证据。
    美国既提不出任何证据，于是它只有乞灵于破口谩骂、胡乱叫嚣，说什么中国政府违反国际法的基本原则呀，违反国际关系的起码的标准呀，违反停战协定呀，甚至还扯到海牙陆战规则和日内瓦战俘协定。这完全是中国人所谓“贼喊捉贼”的伎俩，原不值识者一笑的。但是因为美国代表洛奇以及许多仆从国家的代表们，尤其是那位对美国求宠心切的英国代表纳丁，都乐此不疲地弹这些滥调，因此，我们便不能不就这些方面同他们谈谈，给他们的谬论驳斥一番。
    这些代表们最喜欢谈的是国际法，然而我不相信他们会不知道：国际法的一个基本原则是一个国家没有权利派人到另一个国家的境内去从事间谍活动。另一个基本原则是从事间谍活动的人们一旦被所在地国捕获，捕获国完全有权依照自己的国内法处理。第三个基本原则是对于捕获国如何处理那个间谍，派遣国绝对不能出面干涉或给他外交上的保护。
    拿国际法上关于间谍问题的这三个最基本的原则，让我们来衡量一下阿诺德等人的案子。一切证据已经证明：阿诺德等十一人是美国所派遣乘用飞机偷到中国境内来从事间谍活动的，他们是为美国中央情报局服务的“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”的现役人员，而这个联队的任务是“向苏联和人民民主国家空投间谍分子和接济、接回、联络地面的间谍分子”。他们是在中国境内捕获的。中国法院是依照中国法律审讯他们的，并且是根据中国的一个单行的刑事法规（惩治反革命条例）判决他们的。
    从这些事实看来，中国的所作所为是完全合乎国际法的，而美国的所作所为却完全是违反国际法的。它既没有权利派遣间谍到中国来，更没有权利在那些间谍被捕被判之后向中国提出“抗议”。然而美国政府对于自己这种违法罪行非但毫不知羞，而且竟敢向中国政府“抗议”，还要胁迫联合国“谴责”中国。我真不知道他们根据的什么国际法！
    大家都知道：大规模地派遣间谍特务到外国去从事侦探、破坏、颠覆活动已经成了美国国家政策的一部分。美国每年在“共同安全法案”经费项下用于间谍活动的拨款便是一万万美元。著名的美国军事评论家汉逊·鲍德温在“纽约时报”上写道：
  “在八年来，尤其是从一九五○年朝鲜战争开始以来，美国空军和海军的飞机曾沿着苏联边界飞行过，而且有几次曾越过这些边界。他们一直在寻觅具有不同性质的、正面的和反面的情报。”他又说：
  “另有几架美国的飞机大概是故意穿入别国的空中边界的。这些飞机的任务也许可以称之为进行间谍活动，而与在公海和友好国家领土的上空所作的例行的和连续性的侦察飞行是不同的。这样，就可能用降落伞投下特务人员，并在别国领土的上空进行摄影或电子记录的工作。”鲍德温的报道当然是准确的，只是他故意讳饰地说只有“几”架美国飞机。事实上美国至少有三个空军联队是专门从事这种间谍活动的，四年以来，他们在中国境内所空投的特务被中国公安当局所捕获和歼灭的已有二百多人。
    像美国这样公然地大规模地从事国外间谍活动并把间谍活动提高到国家政策水平的政府，联合国却从不敢有只字的批评，而对在它自己境内捕获和依法判决了十一个这样的间谍的中国政府，联合国却要“控诉”“谴责”，这是多么荒唐的事情啊！请问：联合国的尊严在那里？
    在联合国的美国代表以及那些仆从国家的代表们也知道，捕获国对于所捕获的间谍是可以依照自己的国内法惩处的。于是，他们硬说阿诺德等不是间谍。他们的唯一的“论据”是这些人所穿的是军服而没有“化装”。在整个的讨论过程中，那些代表先生们翻来覆去、重三倒四的便是要发挥这“论据”。
    他们这个论据无疑地是从海牙陆战规则里得到的。因为按照那个规则第二十九条的规定，“化装”（“乔装”、“改装”）是构成间谍的一个条件。
    且不说海牙规则第二十九条并没有规定“化装”是间谍绝对必要的条件，因为虽不化装而用“欺诈手段”（“虚伪口实”）混入交战国战区从事刺探情报，依照该条的规定，同样可以构成间谍罪。我们要强调指出的是：海牙陆战规则和中国这个判处美国间谍的案子是丝毫没有关系的。中国法院在这个案子里适用的完全是中国的国内法——一个单行的刑事法规，而不是海牙陆战规则。无论从严格的法理讲、或者从一般常识讲，海牙陆战规则对这个案里都是完全不能适用的。因为：第一，在朝鲜战争里，中国和美国不是交战国家；第二，这些美国间谍并不是在“战区”捕获的而是在非“战区”的中国领土安东县西郊捕获的。在这种情形之下，适用于“敌国”“战区”的海牙规则是与本案完全不相干的。中国法院不但可以而且应该适用它自己的国内法。
    中国法院根据它自己的国内法判断一个犯人是否间谍，不是按照他所穿的衣服而是按照他所干的行为以及这种行为的意图和目的。中国法院根据大量的和可靠的证据，断定了阿诺德等这一群人乘用飞机偷入中国国境，其目的是要进行间谍活动、危害中国的安全，因而把他们当做犯了间谍罪行处理。这完全是中国国内法的适用问题，同海牙陆战规则根本不发生关系。
    可是那位热心讨好美国的英国代表纳丁却自以为抓住了海牙规则的半根草（“化装”二字），便大做其文章并扮起一副愤怒的鬼脸，在联合国大会上拍案搥桌、大叫大嚷、说“难道要穿着本国制服并且乘在一架飞机中的十一名空军人员是要降落到中国领土去进行间谍活动的吗？”又说：“一个间谍会穿着一种衣服——他本国的军服，这种衣服必然使他无法混杂在他要进行秘密活动和颠覆活动的每个地方的居民中间。”纳丁这个得意“论点”在联合国大会里被其他代表们鹦鹉学舌地重复了许多遍。
    然而纳丁等人显然是假装天真。谁都知道，现代的间谍活动与旧时的不同，是不一定要混杂在他要进行秘密活动和颠覆活动的那个“地方的居民中间”去的。老实说，纵使那十一名美国飞行人员换上便服、礼服、牧师服，或者中国绅士服、农民服，他们也不太可能“混杂”在“地方的居民的中间”的。但是，一架飞机偷入到他国境内，它本身便可做许多间谍活动。它可以进行测量地面的山川形势，它可以观察地面情形、收听地面情报，它可照相，它可录音，它可以用无线电同地面上的间谍们联络，它可以空投间谍特务或投掷武器物资接济他们，而且更巧妙的是它还可以用一种名为“空取器”的东西把早先空投了的间谍特务从地面上接运回去。我想任何参观过北京“美国空投特务罪证展览会”、看过他们所用的各色各样的奇巧设备的人，都会晓得纳丁的间谍必须“化装”“混杂到……地方居民中间”的那种说法是毫无根据的。
    联合国的美国代表和它的追随者们既不敢认间谍为间谍，那么，这些是什么呢？只有硬把他们说成是“战俘”了。从“战俘”，那些代表先生们便扯到“朝鲜停战协定”上去了。他们说：按照停战协定第三条的规定，全部战俘都应该在一九五三年九月二十五日以前被释放与遣返，而中国没有把这些人遣返是违反“朝鲜停战协定”的，是“非法”的，中国法院对这些人“进行审讯和判罪”是应该被“谴责”的。这便是联合国中那些代表们的全部论据，也就是十六国所提的那个所谓“控诉案”的主要理由。
    但是这个论据、这个理由，无论从法理上或常识上去讲，都是完全站不住脚的！因为它牵扯到朝鲜停战协定，这就使我们不能不谈一谈这个协定。
    诚然，依照朝鲜停战协定第三条的规定，“各方所收容的全部战俘”是应该被“释放与遣返”的。但是这个条文与阿诺德等人的案子是丝毫没有关系的。这个条文中所谓“各方”是指交战的各方，也就是在协定上签字的各方，即朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军为一方，联合国军为另一方。这个解释从来没有发生过争执，美国方面也没有提出过任何异议。根据这个解释，那么，所谓“各方所收容的全部战俘”，在朝鲜方面当然是指朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面所收容的战俘，这是再明白不过的了。
    阿诺德等十一位是不是这样的“战俘”呢？答：不是！不是！首先，他们不是“战俘”而是间谍。他们不是在朝鲜战场上被朝鲜人民军或中国人民志愿军俘获的，也不是由朝鲜人民军或中国人民志愿军收容的，而是在中国境内辽宁省安东市以西被中国农民捕获的，由中国公安机关拘留的。他们不是在朝鲜战场上作战或执行军事任务时被俘虏的，而是在中国境内进行间谍活动时被捉到的。这是两种绝对不同的情况。因此，很显然，朝鲜停战协定第三条的规定对阿诺德等人是完全不适用的。
    在联合国代表先生们中间还有一种更奇怪的说法。他们说：“停战协定保证要把像施刑者、谋杀犯、间谍和煽动者这种已知的战犯也进行交换。”这个说法也是没有根据的。首先，停战协定并没有任何条款保证这类人的遣返。根据一九四九年日内瓦战俘公约第一百一十九条的规定，收容国是完全有权扣留他们的。在法理上讲，任何遣返战俘的规定是不包括这种人在内的。但是朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面为了表示宽大，确曾把数以百计的这种犯过罪的战俘们送交对方，其中有些是国际法上所称的“战犯”，有些是在俘虏营里为非作歹的犯人。这些人的情形与阿诺德等的情形是完全不同的。他们是在朝鲜战场上被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军所俘虏和收容的战俘；而阿诺德等却是在中国境内进行间谍活动被中国人民所捕获，为中国公安机关所拘留的间谍。他们既不是战俘，也不是战犯。这两种人虽都犯有罪行，然而他们的法律地位却是完全两样的。说朝鲜停战协定保证要把一切犯罪战俘们遣返已经是不正确的；说朝鲜停战协定还应该包括像阿诺德等这一群人的遣返在内，那更是
  “胡扯”了。
    但是美国代表和它的应声虫们咬定中国违反朝鲜停战协定，因而必须加以“控诉”“谴责”，其全部论据都是从这样的“胡扯”得来的。对于美方多次严重违反停战协定、扣留数万朝中战俘的行为，联合国的先生们从来是一声不响；对于一贯严格遵守停战协定的中国方面，他们倒要进行什么“控诉”、什么“谴责”。这就是使得他们这个决议案成为特别荒谬可耻的原因所在。
    记得澳大利亚代表斯宾德，在联合国大会讨论中国判处美国间谍案的时候，也装出过一副慷慨激昂的样子，说：假使不能对中国采取行动，这将等于给联合国“敲起丧钟”！在这里，我们要正告斯宾德，给联合国“敲起丧钟”的正是美国和它的帮凶国家的代表先生们的行动！
    至于中国，我们一向是维护世界和平和国际合作的。但是，对于美国侵犯我国主权、干涉我国内政和颠覆我国政府的阴谋罪行，我们必然坚决反对并予以严厉的还击。联合国大会通过的所谓十六国提案是非法的，决不会受到中国人民和全体进步人类的重视。
