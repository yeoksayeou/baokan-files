    Large Quantities of Fruit Arrive in the Capital
    In the early winter season, a large quantity of fresh fruit from the south has been transported to the capital. The famous Huangyan honey tangerines, Xinhui mandarin oranges, and Nanfeng small tangerines have been well-received by the people of the capital. In the fourth quarter alone, the Beijing State-owned Food Company and cooperatives supplied the city with 20 million jin of apples, bananas, and tangerines, an increase of 84% compared to the same period last year. There are more than ten varieties of fruit. Due to the bumper harvests of fruit in various regions and improved management, the prices of various fruits have been reduced by an average of 6.7% compared to the past.

    大量水果运到首都
    在初冬季节，大量的新鲜水果从南方运到了首都。著名的黄岩蜜桔、新会柑、南丰小桔受到了首都人民的欢迎。第四季度，仅北京市国营食品公司和合作社供应全市的苹果、香蕉、柑桔三种就有二千万斤，比去年同期增加百分之八十四。水果品种有十多种。由于各地水果丰收和改进了经营管理，各种水果价格比过去平均减低百分之六点七。
