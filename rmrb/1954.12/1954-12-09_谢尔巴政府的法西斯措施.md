    The Fascist Measures of the Scelba Government
    Tan Wenrui
    The Italian Scelba government recently announced that it would instruct its judicial organs to treat the statements of Italian Communist Party members in newspapers more strictly in the future, and stipulated that Italian Communist Party staff members should be excluded from state institutions and state-managed enterprises. This reactionary measure shows that the Italian ruling group is determined to embark on the road of establishing fascist rule.
    In recent years, due to the increasing political awareness of the Italian people, the balance of political forces in Italy has undergone significant changes. The Christian Democratic Party and its allies have become increasingly unpopular due to their policy of selling out national interests; while the democratic forces led by the Italian Communist Party have received the growing trust and support of the broad masses. This is not only reflected in the significant victory that the democratic forces gained in the elections last June and July, but also in the unstable state of the Christian Democratic government since the election. Now, the Italian Communist Party has become a huge political force, with more than 2,130,000 members as of June 30 this year. Even Herbert Matthews, the Rome correspondent of the American "New York Times," who was ordered to spread rumors and slander the Italian Communist Party, had to admit the following fact:
    "Regarding the Italian communist movement, one must understand that it has genuine and broad mass support. ...This widespread support comes from workers, peasants, civil servants, students and other intellectuals...."
    It is precisely because of the growing influence of the Italian Communist Party that the Italian ruling group and its protectors feel terrified. They are trying to rely on fascist means of suppression to prevent the development of the Italian Communist Party and to crack down on the Italian people's peace and democratic movement.
    Since 1948, the Christian Democratic Party government has wantonly undermined the constitution, implemented police rule, and intensified its brutal methods of dealing with progressive forces. In the past five years or more, 68 people have been killed, more than 4,000 have been injured, and more than 130,000 have been sentenced to more than 16,000 years in prison. Most of these victims are Communist Party members. Last year, the Christian Democratic Party manipulated the parliament to pass the illegal so-called "election reform law," attempting to seize the seats of the Communist Party and other democratic parties in the parliament, so that it could unscrupulously promote reactionary domestic and foreign policies. After the Scelba government came to power, on March 31 this year, it imitated the fascist actions of the United States and ordered so-called "loyalty investigations" of government employees, in preparation for this latest round of political persecution of Communist Party members. This evil act of the Christian Democratic Party government cannot but arouse the condemnation of peace-loving and democratic people of all countries.
    This reactionary measure of the Italian ruling authorities was obviously taken under the pressure and instigation of the American aggressive forces. According to reports from American news agencies, at the beginning of this year, when Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce, the American ambassador to Italy, returned to Washington, she "told Eisenhower's colleagues that she was dissatisfied with the Italian government's tolerance towards left-wing opposition parties and trade union organizations." Shortly thereafter, American officials publicly announced that the general policy of the American government was: "Overseas orders can only be given to factories where the workers are not controlled by communist unions." Recently, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Rome officially declared that the United States had cancelled its orders to two Italian companies on the grounds that most of the workers in these two factories were communists, and threatened that the United States would take the same measures against other Italian enterprises "controlled by communists." Washington is attempting to use this blackmailing tactic to support the reactionary group in Italy in attacking the democratic freedoms of the working people, and to weaken the influence of the Italian Communist Party. Therefore, when the Scelba government announced the new measures to persecute Italian Communist Party members, the American propaganda machine could not help but cheer, saying that this was "the toughest step to deal with the most powerful Communist Party outside the Iron Curtain."
    The Scelba government's adoption of such reactionary measures at this time has its sinister purpose. As everyone knows, the Italian ruling group is trying to submit the Paris Agreement to parliament for debate and ratification recently, and people from all walks of life in Italy are launching a vigorous movement to oppose the ratification of this agreement. The Italian ruling group obviously wants to use this tyrannical measure to intimidate and suppress the people's struggle. This is the same trick as the crime of the Bonn group in West Germany in illegally trying the leaders of the German Communist Party.
    However, as Comrade Togliatti, the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, pointed out: "The consequences of this repressive measure will soon be felt. In a certain period, its results will be exactly the opposite of what those who are planning and trying to implement these measures expect." The repressive measures of the Italian Christian Democratic Party government cannot stop the development of the Italian Communist Party, nor can they stop the Italian people's struggle for peace and democracy. Don't forget that the corpse of Mussolini, the originator of fascism, was hung upside down in the Piazzale Loreto in Milan.

    谢尔巴政府的法西斯措施
    谭文瑞
    意大利谢尔巴政府最近宣布，要它的司法机构今后更加严格地对待意大利共产党党员在报纸上的言论，并规定要排除国家机构中和国家管理的企业中的意共工作人员。这种反动的措施表明，意大利统治集团一心要走上建立法西斯统治的道路。
    最近几年来，由于意大利人民政治觉悟的日益提高，意大利国内的政治力量的对比起了显著的变化。天主教民主党及其同盟者由于奉行出卖民族利益的政策，愈来愈不得人心；而以意大利共产党为首的民主力量则受到广大群众不断增长的信任和拥护。这不仅表现在去年六七月间民主力量在选举中所获得的重大胜利上，而且也表现在选举以后天主教民主党政府的不稳定的状态上。现在，意大利共产党已成为一支巨大的政治力量，到今年六月三十日止已拥有二百一十三万多名党员。甚至奉命造谣诬蔑意大利共产党的美国“纽约时报”驻罗马记者赫尔勃·马费斯也不得不承认了这样的事实：
    “关于意大利共产主义运动，人们必须明白，它是有着真正的广大群众支持的。……这种广泛的支持来自工人、农民、公务员、学生和其他的知识分子……。”
    正是由于意大利共产党影响的日益增大，使得意大利统治集团及其保护者感到恐惶。他们企图依靠法西斯的镇压手段来阻止意大利共产党的发展，并打击意大利人民的和平民主运动。
    天主教民主党政府自从一九四八年以来，肆意破坏宪法，实行警察统治，变本加厉地采取残暴手段对付进步力量。在过去五年多之中，就有六十八人被杀害，四千多人被打伤，十三万多人被判处了一万六千多年的徒刑。而这些被迫害者中大部分是共产党员。去年天主教民主党并操纵议会通过了非法的所谓“选举改革法”，妄图借此劫夺共产党和其他民主党派在议会中的议席，以便能够肆无忌惮地推行反动的国内外政策。谢尔巴政府上台后，今年三月三十一日就曾仿效美国的法西斯行径，下令对政府工作人员进行所谓“忠贞调查”，以为最近这一次进一步对共产党员进行政治迫害作准备。天主教民主党政府的这种罪恶勾当不能不引起爱好和平、民主的各国人民的谴责。
    意大利统治当局的这种反动措施，显然是在美国侵略势力的压力和指使下采取的。据美国通讯社的报道，今年年初，美国驻意大利大使克莱尔·卢斯夫人回到华盛顿时，就“曾告诉艾森豪威尔的同僚说：她不满意意大利政府对左翼反对党派和各工会组织表现的容忍态度”。不久以后，美国的官员公开宣布，美国政府的总政策是：“海外定单只能给予那些共产党工会没有控制着工人的工厂”。最近美国国务院和罗马的美国大使馆正式声明，美国撤销它向意大利两家公司的订货，理由是这两家工厂的工人大部分是共产党员，而且扬言美国将采取同样的手段对待其他“已受共产党控制的”意大利企业。华盛顿企图使用这种讹诈手段来支持意大利的反动集团进攻劳动人民的民主自由，并削弱意大利共产党的影响。因此，当谢尔巴政府宣布采取迫害意大利共产党员新措施时，美国的宣传机器便情不自禁地喝采，说这是“对付铁幕外最强大的共产党的最强硬的步骤”。
    谢尔巴政府在现在这个时候，采取这种反动措施，是有其险恶的目的的。人所共知，意大利统治集团企图在最近把巴黎协定提交议会辩论和批准，而意大利各阶层人民正展开了如火如荼的运动来反对批准这一协定。意大利统治集团显然想利用这种横暴的措施来威吓和镇压人民的斗争。这和西德波恩集团对德国共产党领袖进行非法审判的罪行是同出一辙的。
    但是，正如意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂同志所指出的：“这种镇压措施的后果将很快地被人感觉出来。在一定时期内，它的结果会和那些正在策划和企图实行这些措施的人们所预期的恰恰相反。”意大利天主教民主党政府的镇压措施既不能阻止意大利共产党的发展，也不能遏止意大利人民争取和平民主的斗争。不要忘记，法西斯主义的鼻祖墨索里尼的尸体是被倒悬在米兰的罗利多广场上的。
