As Vice Premier of the State Council, He Long writes:

The Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway, built on the roof of the world, have been successfully opened to traffic simultaneously. Such a magnificent, arduous, and vast project is an unprecedented feat in Chinese history and a rare miracle in the world. From now on, the heart of the motherland—Beijing—will be more closely connected to the remote Kangzang Plateau. How excited and proud this should make us!

The construction of the Kangzang Highway began shortly after the end of the mainland liberation war, around the time of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, when the country was still in the early stages of economic recovery and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea was in full swing. The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, closely concerned about the millions of Tibetan compatriots who had suffered greatly, ordered the troops of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet to "help all fraternal ethnic groups, fear no difficulties, and work hard to build roads!" To bring a bright future to the people of Tibet. For more than three years, the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet have resolutely followed Chairman Mao's wise instructions, carrying out the great task of "marching while building roads." Together with the heroic laborers and technicians, they engaged in selfless labor, displaying a high degree of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, and fought tenaciously against nature day and night. They experienced countless unexpected dangers, braving the bitter cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius to fight on the summit of Que'er Mountain, more than 5,300 meters above sea level, chopping wood from dozens of miles away, baking frozen earth, and blasting as they went; they worked in mid-air on cliffs dozens to hundreds of meters high, opening up bridgeheads and road surfaces; they fought against mountain floods and glaciers unseen on the plateau for decades along hundreds of miles of lines; and they conquered countless obstacles such as stubborn rocks, quicksand, earthquake zones, and swampy areas. In more than three years, they built more than 230 bridges over cliffs and torrents, and dug more than 2,860 culverts from solid rock, excavating more than 29 million cubic meters of earth and stone. For more than three years, the road-building troops and workers never lived in houses, working in ice, snow, and mud during the day and living in cold and damp tents at night; when heavy snow blocked the mountains, and supplies could not be delivered, they could only drink thin porridge, but they still insisted on construction; without tools, they used local materials and created with their own hands; lacking experience, they widely carried out engineering democracy and technical innovation movements in the troops, concentrating the wisdom of the masses, improving operating methods, and increasing work efficiency dozens or hundreds of times. In this way, thousands of steel drills were worn down in their hands, and shovels were sharpened like sickles, and finally they conquered fourteen uninhabited mountains above 2,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level; crossed the snow line on the towering peaks and ridges covered with snow all year round; crossed countless raging torrents with a flow rate of six to eight meters per second, which had been known as insurmountable natural barriers since ancient times; and passed through many hundreds of miles of dense primeval forests and boundless grassland marsh areas. Under such difficult conditions and urgent tasks, they not only carried out land reclamation and production, becoming self-sufficient in some grain and vegetables, but also advanced the Kangzang Highway by 2,255 kilometers, victoriously reaching Lhasa, the end of this heroic highway. This not only concentratedly demonstrates the heroic, tenacious, and hard-struggling traditional spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the indomitable will and infinite wisdom of the Chinese working class, but more importantly, this great initiative in the construction of the motherland has powerfully inspired the patriotic production increase movement and the will to fight against U.S. aggression and aid Korea of the people of the whole country. The song of Erlang Mountain has spread throughout the country, and the builders of the socialist cause have drawn strength from here.

The rapid opening of the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway is another great victory in China's socialist construction. This could only be achieved in the new China of the people, under the wise leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and with deep concern for minority nationalities. This vivid fact fully demonstrates the great superiority of the people's democratic system, and it also fully demonstrates that there are no insurmountable difficulties in front of the hardworking and brave Chinese people.

The serious backwardness in politics, economy, and culture caused by the long-term oppression of the Tibetan people under the successive ruling classes' Han chauvinism, the estrangement between the Tibetan and Han nationalities, and the years of imperialist conspiracies to invade Tibet are now gone forever. For more than three years, the People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet and local staff have faithfully implemented the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, resolutely implemented the Chinese Communist Party's and Chairman Mao's ethnic policies, and actively helped the Tibetan people develop production, trade, health, and cultural and educational undertakings. The Han and Tibetan nationalities have been closely united. The broad masses of Tibetan people are deeply convinced that only by consolidating their unity in the great family of the motherland can they gradually realize a bright and happy tomorrow. In fact, with the construction of the highway, the face of the Kangzang Plateau is changing every day. New market towns have appeared in the desolate valleys along the highway: trade companies and cooperatives that supply the daily needs of the people, post and telecommunications bureaus and banks that serve the people, have gradually opened. New buildings are being built one after another. Farmland has been opened up on the grasslands, and advanced farming methods and new-style agricultural tools have been promoted. Local bulk medicinal materials, furs, and other local products and specialties are being transported to the interior by thousands of vehicles. Batches of grain, tea, and daily necessities are being transported to the border areas, and the lives of the people along the way have begun to improve somewhat. It can be said with certainty that the opening of the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway will inevitably promote the development of the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of the Tibetan nationality, and the material and cultural lives of the Kangzang people will inevitably gradually improve and improve with the development of the motherland's large-scale socialist economic construction. This will inevitably have a great effect on strengthening and consolidating the unity of the motherland, enhancing the unity of the Han and Tibetan people, building the border areas, defending the socialist construction of the motherland, and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.

However, in order to "gradually develop the politics, economy, and culture of all nationalities in the common cause of building the motherland, gradually eliminate the de facto inequality between all nationalities left over from history, so that backward nationalities can join the ranks of advanced nationalities, and gradually transition to socialist society," we still need to do longer and more arduous work. The completion of the highway to Lhasa is only the first step in the long-term construction of Tibet, and it cannot be said that everything will be fine as soon as the highway is opened. The work ahead is still very arduous, and the difficulties ahead are still many. Our troops entering Tibet and all staff members must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, be honest and diligent, and continue to strengthen the labor concept of socialist construction, carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle, and enthusiastically and practically help the Tibetan people politically, economically, and culturally for a long time, and steadily develop the construction cause of Tibet. At the same time, the troops and organs themselves should work hard to produce, strive for self-sufficiency in grain as much as possible, and thus promote the development of local social productive forces. Only in this way can the long-term construction of Tibet be guaranteed, and can the poor and backward Kangzang Plateau finally be transformed into a happy and prosperous place. It is also necessary to continue to resolutely implement the Party's policy of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief, oppose great Han chauvinism and local nationalism, heighten vigilance, and strictly guard against any instigation and sabotage by imperialist special agents and spies, so as to consolidate ethnic unity, enhance ethnic friendship and trust, and closely unite in the loving and cooperative great family of the motherland, under the leadership of the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, and strive to defend the socialist cause of the motherland and build Tibet for the long term.

    帮助藏族人民长期建设西藏
    国务院副总理　贺龙
    修筑在世界屋脊上的康藏公路和青藏公路，同时胜利地通车了。这样气魄雄伟、艰巨而浩大的工程，在我国历史上是亘古未有的创举，在全世界也是罕有的奇迹。从此，祖国的心脏——北京与遥远的康藏高原就更加紧密的接连起来了。该使我们如何的兴奋和自豪！
    康藏公路的修筑，早在大陆解放战争结束不久，和平解放西藏前后，国家还处在经济恢复的初期，抗美援朝斗争正在紧张进行之际，就已经开始了。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席密切关怀着饱受灾难的数百万藏族同胞，命令中国人民解放军进藏部队，“为了帮助各兄弟民族，不怕困难，努力筑路！”把光明的前途带给西藏人民。三年多来进藏人民解放军，坚决遵循着毛主席的英明指示，执行着
  “一面进军，一面修路”的伟大任务。他们和英勇的民工，技工们在一起，进行忘我的劳动，发扬了高度的爱国主义和革命英雄主义，日日夜夜与大自然顽强地搏斗着。他们经历了无数意想不到的惊险，曾经冒着零下三十度的严寒，战斗在拔海五千三百多公尺的雀儿山顶，从几十里以外砍伐木柴，烘烧冻土，边灼边开；曾经在高达数十到数百公尺的悬崖绝壁上悬空作业，开出桥头和路面；曾经在数百里的线路上与高原几十年来未有过的山洪冰川搏斗抢险；也曾经征服了顽石、流沙、地震区、沮洳地等数不清的重重障碍；三年多当中，他们在峭壁激流上架起了二百三十多座桥梁，从坚石中凿通了二千八百六十多座涵洞，开了二千九百多万立方公尺的土石方。而三年多来筑路部队和职工们却一直没住过房子，白天在冰雪泥浆中劳动，晚上在寒冷潮湿的帐篷里住宿；大雪封山的日子，补给不上，只能喝稀饭，仍然坚持施工；没有工具，就地取材，用自己的双手创造；缺乏经验，在部队中广泛开展工程民主、技术创造运动，集中群众的智慧，改进操作方法，将工作效率提高了数十百倍。就是这样，千万根钢钎在他们的手上磨秃了，铁锹磨得像镰刀一样，终于战胜了十四座拔海两千到五千多公尺以上的人迹罕至的大山；翻过了终年积雪的奇峰峻岭上的雪线；跨过了无数道怒涛汹涌每秒流速六公尺到八公尺的自古传为不可逾越的激流天险；穿过了许多段长达数百里遮天蔽日的原始森林和一望无际的草原沼泽地带。就在这样困难的条件和紧迫的任务中，他们不仅进行了开荒生产，自给了一部分粮食和蔬菜，而且使康藏公路前进了二千二百五十五公里，胜利的到达了这条英雄公路的终点拉萨。这不仅集中的表现了中国人民解放军英勇顽强艰苦奋斗的传统精神和中国工人阶级坚韧不拔的毅力和无穷的智慧，更重要的是祖国建设的这一伟大创举，曾经有力地鼓舞了全国人民的爱国增产运动和抗美援朝的斗争意志，二郎山的歌声传遍全国，社会主义事业的建设者，曾经从这里取到战斗的力量。
    康藏公路和青藏公路的迅速通车，是我国社会主义建设事业中又一次巨大的胜利。这只有在人民的新中国，在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导和对少数民族的深切关怀下，才能实现的。这一生动的事实，充分地说明了人民民主制度的巨大优越性，也充分地说明了在勤劳勇敢的中国人民面前，是没有任何不可克服的困难。
    藏族人民在历代反对统治阶级大汉族主义的长期压迫下所造成的政治上、经济上和文化上的严重落后状态，和藏、汉民族间的隔阂，以及历史上帝国主义者阴谋进窥西藏的年代，现在是一去不复返了。三年多来中国人民解放军进藏部队和地方工作人员，忠实地执行了关于和平解放西藏办法的协议，坚决贯彻了中国共产党、毛主席的民族政策，积极帮助藏族人民发展生产、贸易、卫生和文化教育事业。汉、藏民族已经亲密地团结起来了，广大的藏族人民深信，只有巩固地团结在祖国大家庭里，才能逐步实现美好幸福的明天。事实上，随着公路的修筑，康藏高原的面貌每天都有所改变，公路沿线的荒凉山谷已出现了新的集镇：供应人民日用需要的贸易公司和合作社，为人民服务的邮电局和银行，都逐渐开办起来了。一幢幢的新建筑兴修起来了。草原上开辟了良田，推行了先进耕作方法和新式农具。当地大宗的药材、皮毛等土产、特产，正由千百辆汽车运往内地。成批的粮食、茶叶和日用品源源运往边疆，沿路人民的生活也开始获得了某些改善，肯定地说，康藏公路和青藏公路的通车，必然会促进西藏民族的政治、经济和文化事业的发展，康藏人民的物质生活和文化生活，也必然会随着祖国大规模的社会主义经济建设的发展而逐步地改善和提高，这对于加强和巩固祖国的统一，增强汉藏人民的团结，建设边疆，保卫祖国的社会主义建设，以及维护远东与世界和平，必然发生巨大的作用。
    但是，要“在建设祖国的共同事业中，逐步地发展各民族的政治、经济和文化，逐步地消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，使落后民族得以跻于先进民族的行列，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。”我们还须要做更长期更艰巨的工作。公路修通到拉萨，仅仅是长期建设西藏的第一步，更不能说公路一通一切马上就会好起来了，前面的工作还是很艰巨的，前面的困难还是很多的。我进藏部队和全体工作人员，必须戒骄戒躁，老老实实，勤勤恳恳，继续加强社会主义建设的劳动观念，发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，热忱而切实地从政治上、经济上、文化上长期地帮助藏族人民，稳步地发展西藏的建设事业。同时，部队和机关本身，更应努力生产，尽可能争取粮食自给，从而推动当地社会生产力向前发展。只有这样，长期建设西藏才有保证，才能使贫困落后的康藏高原，最后变为幸福繁荣的地方。还必须继续坚决贯彻党的民族平等和宗教信仰自由的政策，反对大民族主义和地方民族主义，提高警惕，严防帝国主义特务间谍的任何挑拨破坏，以巩固民族团结，增进民族友谊和信任，亲密地团结在友爱合作的祖国大家庭里，在各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，为保卫祖国的社会主义事业，长期建设西藏而努力。
