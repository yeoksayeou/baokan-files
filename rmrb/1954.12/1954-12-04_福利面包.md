	“Welfare Bread”
	By Our Reporter Zhang Chao
	Before the summer of this year.
	Every morning, in the Shanghai Zhengtai Rubber Factory, there was a "bread time." This time was inserted right in the middle of production. The time was not long – about ten minutes or so – but it was the most active time of the day for the entire factory.
		“Get your bread!”
	At this command, the workers would put down their work and rush to get their bread.
		“Give me bread!”
		“I want cake!”
		“Distribute spring rolls!”
	During this period, all sorts of strange phenomena would occur in various workshops: Sometimes, workers in the tire workshop, eager to get their bread, would forget to tighten the screws on the mold, and rubber would flow out of the mold seams, resulting in a defective tire; sometimes, workers in the mixing workshop would only care about eating bread, extending the mixing time, which would reduce the plasticity of the rubber, naturally affecting the quality of the product; sometimes, some workers would even quarrel over eating bread, leading to several days of not speaking to each other. …
	However, no matter what happened, the workers had never thought about the origin of the bread, believing it to be "welfare bread." Needless to say during the private ownership period, even after the joint public-private ownership in January of this year, this bread-eating system was maintained for a full six months.
	The change occurred after June.
	At that time, the discussion of the draft constitution had just ended, the birthday of the Chinese Communist Party – "July 1st" – was approaching, and the first employee representative meeting after the joint public-private ownership of the Zhengtai Rubber Factory had already been held. These three major events excited many workers, especially the Communist Party members. A group of advanced workers, with the support and encouragement of the trade union, had already taken the lead in giving up "welfare bread."
	However, at the beginning, they did not explain their actions in detail to the other workers. They only said:
		“Eating bread is unreasonable.” And so on.
	At this time, the joint venture was still new, and although most workers were enthusiastic and actively producing due to the change in the nature of the enterprise and encouraged by the three major events, they had not yet thought about what was behind this "welfare bread," and the reaction was lukewarm; some backward workers even couldn't understand why eating bread would be "unreasonable" for a while, and couldn't help but say some strange things.
	Xu Azhang, a Communist Party member and molding worker in the tire workshop, was one of the first to give up bread. But he was ridiculed by another worker, Gu Jinsheng:
		“That's called suffering for the sake of saving face!”
	In a few days, the situation suddenly changed dramatically. The whole factory was spreading such a thing, and this thing was told by Xu Azhang and others from the tire workshop. Although Xu Azhang and others knew about this in the past, they had never analyzed its meaning. These days, after hearing the cold ridicule from others, they felt that things were not simple. After studying with the branch and the trade union, their hearts suddenly became clear. So, at a symposium on the bread issue, he and several old workers told a story of personal experience:
	After the liberation of Shanghai, domestic tires replaced imported goods, and sales were unprecedentedly good. The Warrior tires produced by the Zhengtai Rubber Factory were also a famous brand, and sales were particularly good. Seeing that tires were profitable, the capitalist started to calculate in the tire workshop. In the tire workshop, the last and most important step was the curing section, and the amount of product depended on the skills of the curing workers. The capitalist thought: if he could win over the curing workers, even more profit would be readily available. He would often personally or send people to the tire workshop to curry favor with the curing workers.
		“If you have any difficulties, just bring them up, and I will definitely find a way to solve them.”
		“How about the curing section producing more?”
		“If you’re hungry in the morning, go to the ‘Great China Restaurant’ across the street and put it on my tab,” the capitalist said generously.
		“That’s not necessary,” the curing worker said hesitantly, adding casually: “It would be nice to have some porridge in the morning.”
	The capitalist, of course, readily agreed.
	From then on, the curing workers had a good bowl of porridge every day, with good side dishes such as shredded dried pork and preserved eggs. However, trouble came. The workers in other sections of the tire workshop were very dissatisfied.
		“We’re doing the same work, why don’t we get porridge!”
		“If we eat, the whole workshop should eat!”
	The capitalist had no choice but to pretend to be generous again and agree to let the whole workshop eat. Then, the employees of the entire factory clamored for it. Finally, the trade union had to come forward to negotiate, and the porridge was changed to bread, and it was implemented throughout the factory.
	Xu Azhang and other old workers summed up this story and said: this is not welfare, this is the petty kindness of the capitalist. You must know that he can squeeze a lot of profit from a bowl of porridge and a piece of bread! However, we workers are fighting over a bowl of porridge and a piece of bread, and we can't even take care of labor discipline. Now that our factory has become a joint public-private enterprise, why should we keep the old capitalist system?
	The inside story of this story surprised the workers. Needless to say about others, even the curing workers were not very clear in the past. Now, once Xu Azhang and others pointed it out, they suddenly realized. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party branch and the trade union, with Communist Party members, Youth League members, and activists as the core, various workshops held meetings one after another and launched a factory-wide discussion. Around the bread issue, the workers used the method of recalling and comparing to recognize the corruption of capitalist enterprises, the socialist vision, and the responsibility of the working class in transforming old enterprises.
	Shen Fuhe, a molding worker, told a secret of his own:
		“No wonder one day when I was eating porridge, the capitalist came and quietly asked me: ‘How is the work going?’ I said: ‘Too heavy, a bit overwhelming.’ ‘How is life lately?’ I said, ‘A bit difficult.’ He stuffed a stack of banknotes into my hand: ‘If you have any difficulties in the future, tell me again.’ I needed money at the time, so I didn’t think about it and accepted it. At that time, I was very grateful to him, and I thought: ‘Now capitalists are also enlightened.’ Now when I think about it, the capitalist wanted to buy me off and make me work hard for him to earn money. Some of us workers only covet small advantages, which is really dangerous!”
	Old worker Liu Yuyin recalled his bitter days in the old society and compared the past with the present. He also wrote these in a wall newspaper:
		“We must all think back to how difficult life was in the old society. When we received (half a month's) wages at the end of the month, we ran as fast as we could, but we still couldn't buy two dou of rice. If the money was left at home overnight, we couldn't even buy a few sheng of rice the next day. I remember once when I received my salary, several small money shops on Jiangxi Road were selling silver dollars. The price changed more than ten times in one hour, increasing each time. By the time I received my salary and went to buy them, the money had been cut in half. … After liberation, we workers became masters of the country, and our work and life are guaranteed, and we also enjoy labor insurance, and prices are stable. Just comparing wages, a month's salary before liberation could only buy four or five dou of rice at most, but now it can buy more than two shi; now many workers live in new houses, which they couldn't even dream of in the past. Looking at the increasingly beautiful prospects in the future, I am really excited. I think: now that we workers are under the leadership of the Communist Party, our lives are getting better and better, so how can I feel comfortable asking for more welfare? If I covet small welfare now, I will lose big welfare in the future, so I am determined to give up bread.”
	In a few days, the number of workers giving up "welfare bread" increased day by day; the number of people giving up "welfare bread" every day increased from a few, dozens, to hundreds, thousands.
	The workers used a metaphor to illustrate this conclusion:
	“Only by giving up the sesame seeds in front of you can you get the watermelon in the future.”

### “福利面包”

    “福利面包”
    本报记者　张潮
    今年夏季以前。
    每天上午，在上海正泰橡胶厂里有一个“面包时间”。这个时间恰恰插在生产进行中间。时间虽不算长——大约十分钟左右，却是全厂一天当中最活跃的一段时间。
      “领面包！”
    一声令下，工人们便放下活儿，一窝蜂似的去领面包了。
    “给我面包！”
    “我要蛋糕！”
    “发给春卷！”
    在这段时间里，各车间会发生各种各样怪现象：有时，轮胎车间的工人急于去领面包，忘记把模型上的螺丝扣紧，橡胶从模型缝里流出来，结果出了副胎；有时，轧料车间的工人只顾吃面包，延长了轧料时间，橡胶的可塑型便降低，产品的质量自然不好；有时，有些工人为了争吃面包，竟吵起架来，弄得双方几天不说话。……
    但是，不管发生什么事情，工人们对于吃面包的来历一直是没有想过的，认为这是“福利面包”。私营时期不消说，就是在今年一月公私合营以后，足有半年光阴，还保留着这个吃面包的制度。
    发生变化是在六月以后。
    那时，宪法草案的讨论刚结束，中国共产党的生日——“七一”快要到来，正泰橡胶厂公私合营后的第一次职工代表会议已经开过。这三桩大事，激动着不少工人，尤其是共产党员们。一部分先进工人在工会支持和鼓励下，已经带头放弃了“福利面包”。
    不过他们开头也没有对其他工人详细解释自己的行动，他们光讲：
      “吃面包不合理。”等等。
    这时候，合营还不久，大多数工人虽然由于企业改变了性质，又受着那三桩大事的鼓舞，情绪热烈，生产积极，却还没有想到这“福利面包”里面有啥文章，反应是冷淡的；有些落后工人甚至一时想不通吃面包会是“不合理”，少不得说些怪话。
    轮胎车间成型工人、共产党员徐阿章，他是最早放弃面包的一个。却受到了另一个工人顾金生的嘲笑：
      “这叫死要面子活受罪啊！”
    不几天，情况突然起了大变化，全厂流传着这样一件事，这件事就是轮胎车间徐阿章等讲出来的。徐阿章等过去虽然知道这件事，却从来没有去分析过它的含义。这几天听了别人冷讽热嘲，觉得事情不简单，跟支部和工会一研究，心头忽然亮堂了，于是，在一次面包问题的座谈会上，他和几个老工人讲出了这样一节亲自经历过的故事：
    上海解放后，国产轮胎代替了进口货，销路空前好。正泰橡胶厂出产的回力车胎，又是名牌货，销路格外好。资本家眼见轮胎有利可图，便在轮胎车间打算盘。在轮胎车间里，最后又是最紧要的一关是在蒸缸工段，产品多少，要看蒸缸工人的本事。资本家想：如果把蒸缸工人拿住，更多的利润就垂手可得。他就不时亲自或者派人下轮胎车间，巴结蒸缸工人。
    “你们有啥困难，尽管提出来，我一定想办法解决。”
    “蒸缸工段多出点活，大家说行不行？”
    “你们上午肚子饿，就上对面‘大中国酒楼’去，挂我的账。”资本家慷慨地说。
    “那倒不必，”蒸缸工人半信半疑，顺嘴加了一句：“早上有顿稀饭吃，就蛮行了。”
    资本家当然满口答应。
    蒸缸工人从此每天有一顿好稀饭吃，还有肉松、皮蛋等好小菜下饭。可是，麻烦来了，轮胎车间其他工段的工人们很不服气。
    “一样作活，为啥我们没有稀饭吃！”
    “要吃全车间都吃！”
    资本家没办法，又装出慷慨的样子答应全车间都吃。跟着，全厂的职工也哄起来了。最后，工会不得不出面交涉，稀饭改成面包，全厂推行。
    徐阿章等老工人把这段故事归结起来说：这不是什么福利，这是资本家的小恩小惠。要知道，他在一顿稀饭、一份面包里面，可以榨出大油水呢！可是，我们工人却为一顿稀饭、一份面包闹不团结，劳动纪律也顾不得了。如今，我们的工厂已经公私合营，我们为啥还要留下资本主义的旧制度？
    这段故事的底细很使工人们吃惊。不用说旁人，就连蒸缸工人，过去也不大了然。现在一经徐阿章等点破，便恍然大悟。于是，在党支部和工会领导下，以共产党员、青年团员和积极分子为核心，各车间纷纷开会，展开了全厂讨论。围绕着面包问题，工人们用回忆、对比的方法，认清了资本主义企业的腐败，社会主义的远景，工人阶级在改造旧企业中的责任。
    成型工人沈福贺讲出了他自己的一桩秘密：
      “怪不得有一天吃稀饭的时候，资本家悄悄来问我：‘工作怎么样？’我说：‘太重，有点吃不消。’‘近来生活如何？’我说‘有点困难。’他把一叠钞票塞在我手里：‘以后有困难，再对我讲。’我正需要钱用，也没考虑，就收下了。那时我还很感激他，心里想：‘现在资本家也开明了’。现在回头一想，原来资本家想收买我，替他拼命挣钱呢。我们有些工人光贪图小便宜，实在危险！”
    老工人刘于银回忆了他在旧社会里的苦日子，把过去和现在的生活作了对比，他还把这些写在一篇墙报稿里：
      “我们大家要回头想想，当初在旧社会里，那种日子多么难过，到了月底领（半个月的）工资，钱刚到手，连奔带跑，还买不到二斗米。如果钱在家里放一夜，第二天连几升米都买不到了。我记得有一次发工资，江西路有几家小钱庄出卖大袁头（银圆），当天在一个钟头里面连换十几次牌价，一次上涨一次，等我领到工资去买，钱就叫打了个对折。……解放后，我们工人成了国家主人，工作、生活都有了保障，还享受劳保，物价也稳定了。单拿工资来比，解放前一个月的工资最多只能买四、五斗米，现在能买两石多；现在许多工人住新房，过去梦里也见不到的，看看将来愈加美好的光景，真叫我兴奋。我想：现在我们工人在共产党领导下，日子已过得好起来了，再要福利加福利，心里怎么过得去？现在贪图小福利，将来丢了大福利，所以我也决心放弃面包。”
    几天当中，放弃“福利面包”的工人一天比一天多；每天放弃“福利面包”的人数，从几个、几十个增加到几百个、成千个。
    工人们用一个比喻来说明这个结论：
    “只有放弃眼前的芝麻，才能得到将来的西瓜。”
