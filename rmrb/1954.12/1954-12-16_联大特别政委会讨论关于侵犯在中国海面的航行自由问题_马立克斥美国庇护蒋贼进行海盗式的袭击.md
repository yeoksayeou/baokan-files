(Xinhua News Agency, December 15th) According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee began discussing the issue of infringement on freedom of navigation in Chinese waters, as proposed by the Soviet delegation, on December 13th.

    Soviet representative Malik spoke first. He said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's piratical attacks on merchant ships of various countries in Chinese waters have caused serious damage to these ships and have intensified international tensions. The United Nations should study this situation and take measures to stop these attacks and prevent them from happening again. This piracy grossly violates the universally recognized principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas. It is a crime that the United Nations should strongly condemn, especially since those responsible for this activity are not only the Chiang Kai-shek clique but also those who manipulate and instigate them.

    Malik pointed out that dozens of merchant ships of various countries have been subjected to such piratical attacks in Chinese waters. Many citizens of various countries serving as crew members on these ships have been subjected to brutal violence, even injured or killed. The cargo of many merchant ships has been looted. Some ships and their crews are still being held by the pirates.

    Malik pointed out that these piratical attacks are carried out by warships based in Taiwan and operating in waters controlled by the U.S. Navy. It is well known that the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which has been defeated and driven out of mainland China, has been able to temporarily occupy Taiwan due to the support and protection of the United States. U.S. armed forces are obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, preventing the Chinese people from finally resolving this internal Chinese affair, and preventing them from exercising sovereignty over this island belonging to China. The U.S. Navy has imposed military control over Taiwan and its surrounding waters, effectively occupying the Chinese territory of Taiwan. The official U.S. declaration to use armed forces to protect the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime in Taiwan is an interference in China's internal affairs. The recent so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique is intended to legalize the U.S.'s de facto armed occupation of Chinese territory. This treaty is a provocation against the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, and its purpose is to intensify aggression and plot new wars.

    Malik said that it is universally recognized that the actions of a controlled regime should be the responsibility of the party controlling it. Therefore, the U.S. armed forces, which control the Chiang Kai-shek clique, should bear full responsibility for all piratical attacks occurring in Chinese waters. The crimes committed under the protection of the U.S. fleet have aroused the justifiable indignation of all peace-loving people. The United Nations cannot ignore the dangerous situation in Chinese waters. In order to maintain peace and strengthen international cooperation, the United Nations must intervene in this situation immediately. Therefore, the Soviet delegation proposes the following resolution:

    "The United Nations General Assembly,

    Noting the recent repeated instances of warships based in Taiwan and operating under the control of the U.S. authorities engaging in piratical attacks against merchant ships of various countries navigating on the high seas in Chinese waters, looting these ships, and resorting to violence against their crews,

    Considering that such actions constitute a gross violation of the universally recognized principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas, create serious obstacles to world trade, and tend to further aggravate the situation in the Far East,

    Hereby strongly condemns such actions and requests the Government of the United States to take the necessary steps to prevent the recurrence of such actions and to release the foreign merchant ships and their crews detained in Taiwan ports."

    A Kuomintang element then spoke, shamelessly slandering the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. He even claimed that his "government" had the right to engage in such piracy. His speech shows that the Taiwan bandit gang and the external forces supporting them do not intend to stop the piratical behavior in Chinese waters.

    The French representative said that his government would continue to mediate the incident of the Soviet tanker "Tuapse," which was hijacked by the Taiwan authorities on June 23rd of this year, but he pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek "government" had temporarily suspended negotiations on this matter.

    The French representative said that his government has always supported the principle of freedom of navigation, but in the present issue, his delegation will abstain from voting on any proposal that accuses or supports the actions of either party.

     联大特别政委会讨论关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由问题
     马立克斥美国庇护蒋贼进行海盗式的袭击
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会十三日开始讨论苏联代表团提出的关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由问题。
    苏联代表马立克首先发言。他说，蒋介石集团在中国海面对各国商船进行海盗式的袭击，已经给各国商船带来严重的损害，并加剧了国际紧张局势。联合国应当研究这种形势，并且采取措施制止这种袭击，不准以后再发生这种事件。这种海盗行为粗暴地破坏了公认的公海航行自由原则。这是一种罪行，是联合国应该加以强烈谴责的，特别是因为对这一活动负有责任的不仅是蒋介石集团，还有那些操纵和唆使他们的人。
    马立克指出，已有数十艘各国商船在中国海面受到这种海盗式袭击。在这些船只上当船员的各国许多公民受到粗暴的暴力手段的对待，甚至于受伤和被害。许多商船的货物被劫夺了。有一些船只和船上船员直到现在还被扣留在海盗手中。
    马立克指出，这些海盗式袭击，是由以台湾为根据地、并且是在美国海军控制的海面上活动的军舰进行的。大家知道，已被击溃、并且从中国大陆上赶走的蒋介石集团所以能暂时盘踞在台湾，是由于美国的支持和庇护。美国武装力量阻挠中国人民解放台湾，阻挠中国人民最后解决这个中国内政的问题，阻挠他们对这个属于中国的岛屿行使主权。美国海军对台湾及其附近海面实行了军事控制，事实上就是占领了中国领土台湾。美国官方表示要用武装力量来保护台湾的蒋介石傀儡政权，这就是干涉中国的内部事务。最近美国同蒋介石集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”，要使美国事实上武装占领中国领土的行为合法化。这个条约是对中华人民共和国和中国人民的一种挑衅，其目的是要加紧侵略和策划新的战争。
    马立克说，大家公认，被控制的政权的行动，应由控制这个政权的方面负责。因此，控制着蒋介石集团的美国武装力量应该对中国海面发生的一切海盗式袭击负完全的责任。在美国舰队庇护下所犯的罪行，引起了所有爱好和平人民理所当然的愤慨。联合国不能对在中国海面发生的危险形势置之不理。为了维持和平和加强国际合作，联合国必须立刻干预这种情况。因此，苏联代表团提出下列提案：
    “联合国大会，
    注意到最近在中国海面屡次发生以台湾为根据地的、在美国当局控制之下进行活动的军舰对在公海上航行的各国商船进行海盗式的袭击、劫夺这些船只并对它们的船员采取暴力行为的事例，
    认为这种行为是一种恶劣地破坏公认的公海航行自由的原则的行为，给世界贸易造成严重的障碍，并且有使远东的局势变得更加严重的趋势，
    兹特强烈谴责这种行为，并要求美国政府采取必要步骤，以防止这种行为再度发生，并释放被扣留在台湾港口的外国商船和它们的船员。”
    国民党分子接着发言，他无耻地对苏联和中华人民共和国进行诽谤。他甚至于认为他的“政府”有权进行这种海盗行为。他的发言表明，台湾匪帮和支持他们的外界势力不打算停止在中国海面的海盗行为。
    法国代表说，他的政府将继续为解决今年六月二十三日被台湾当局劫走的苏联油船“图阿普斯号”的事件进行调解，但是他指出，蒋介石“政府”已经使关于这个问题的谈判暂时停止。
    法国代表说，他的政府一向支持航行自由的原则，但是在目前这个问题上，他的代表团在表决指责或者赞成任何一方的行动的任何提案时将弃权。
