Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The latest issue of the Japanese magazine "Sekai" (World), under the title "Reflections After Reading the Record of the Meeting with Zhou Enlai," published articles by several prominent Japanese figures discussing their thoughts on Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks on Sino-Japanese relations during his meeting with the Japanese Diet delegation to China in October this year. The editorial department of "Sekai" magazine wrote that Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks "deeply moved the majority of Japanese people who ardently desire Sino-Japanese friendship."

    Akira Kazami, a member of the House of Representatives, stated in his article titled "Restore Diplomatic Relations Soon": Whether viewed from a broad perspective, to create an international environment that enables Japan to become a peaceful nation with a bright future and play a role in world peace; or from a narrow perspective, to pave the way for Japan's economic self-reliance, it is now necessary for Japan to promptly restore diplomatic relations with its neighbors, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Kazami said that the Japanese people's desire to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and China is growing. He pointed out that to realize this desire as soon as possible, it must be transformed into a huge political force. For example, the closure of the Japanese "embassy" in Taiwan is something he hopes can be done immediately.

    Jotaro Kawakami, Chairman of the Right-wing Socialist Party of Japan, said in his article titled "Striving for Peaceful Coexistence": In a word, Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks show that China ardently desires peace. There is no doubt that China advocates peaceful coexistence. He emphasized at the end that it is very necessary for Japan to continue striving to establish friendly diplomatic relations, and he believes this is also the path to world peace.

    Tokutaro Kitamura of the Japanese Democratic Party, in his article, first welcomed the joint declaration by the Chinese and Soviet governments on relations with Japan, saying: This joint declaration, based on the principle that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, creates an opening for the restoration of Sino-Japanese and Japanese-Soviet diplomatic relations. Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks made this even clearer. When discussing Japan's relations with the United States, he said: "We cannot confidently assert that the Japan-U.S. cooperation that the Japanese government has been pursuing so far is equal and mutually beneficial."

    Critic Yoshizo Kawamori wrote that China hopes to restore friendly relations with Japan as soon as possible. This idea is also shared by us, the Japanese people. He said: We can believe that China and Japan will truly establish friendly relations on an equal footing. He also called for the early restoration of transportation between China and Japan.

    Literary critic Katsuiro Kamei pointed out in his article that Japan's independence can only be achieved when the U.S. military completely withdraws. He said: In short, the meeting with Premier Zhou brought a ray of light to Japan's future. For the true reconciliation between China and Japan, it is hoped that this existing path will not be lost.

    Historian Noboru Niida said: Some people are trying to close their eyes and refuse to acknowledge the reality of China, stubbornly rejecting it. I hope these people can face reality.

    Writer Nobuyuki Tatsuno said: In the past, Japanese militarism invaded China, leading to a disastrous defeat and the suffering of the Japanese people. Every Japanese person should deeply remember this. He said: Now Japan still wants to seek a way out for its political and economic problems from a military-demand economy leaning towards the United States, which is highly questionable. He hopes that the day will come soon when the Japanese people can accept Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks in the spirit of national awakening.

    日本公众希望实现周总理的和平共处主张
    【新华社十六日讯】东京消息：最近一期的日本“世界”杂志在“周恩来会见记读后感”的标题下，登载了一些日本知名人士的文章，谈他们对周恩来总理在今年十月接见日本国会议员访华团时就中日关系问题的谈话的感想。“世界”杂志编辑部写道：周恩来总理的谈话“使热望日中友好的大多数日本人民深受感动”。众议院议员风见章在题为“早日恢复邦交”的文章中说：不论从大的方面来说，为了造成一种国际环境，能使日本成为和平国家，并且有光明前途，为了世界和平而发挥作用；或者从小的方面来说，为日本民族的经济自立铺平道路，现在日本都有必要立刻和毗邻的苏联和中华人民共和国早日恢复邦交。风见章说：日本人民要求同苏联、中国恢复邦交的愿望日益高涨。他指出：为了使这种愿望早日实现，要把它化为巨大的政治力量，譬如像封闭日本驻台湾“大使馆”这类的事情，希望立刻就能做到。
    日本右派社会党主席河上丈太郎在以“为和平共处而努力”为题的文章中说：一句话，周恩来总理的谈话说明中国是热望和平的。中国主张和平共处，这是毫无疑问的。他在最后强调说：为了建立友好的邦交关系而继续努力，对于日本很为必要，并且他相信这也是通往世界和平的大道。
    日本民主党的北村德太郎在他的文章中首先对中苏两国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言表示欢迎说：这个联合宣言根据不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处的立场，给恢复日中、日苏邦交创造了一个开端。周恩来总理的谈话使人更明确了这一点。他在谈到日本同美国的关系时说：“我们并没有把握可以断言，到现在为止日本政府所进行的日美合作是平等互利的。”
    评论家河盛好藏著文说：中国希望早日和日本恢复友好关系。这种想法在我们日本人民这方面也同样存在。他说：我们可以相信中国和日本会真正站在平等立场上建立友好关系。他并且要求早日恢复中日两国之间的交通。
    文艺评论家龟井胜一郎在文章中指出，日本的独立只有美军完全撤退才有可能获得。他说：总之，和周总理的会见，给日本的将来带来一线光明。为了中日两国的真正和解，对于现存的这一条道路，希望不要迷失。
    历史家仁井田陞说：有人企图闭上眼睛不看中国的现实，硬要拒绝现实。我希望这种人能够面对现实。
    作家立野信之说：过去，日本军国主义曾侵略中国，招致了惨败和日本人民的涂炭之苦。这件事任何一个日本人应该深记不忘。他说：现在日本还想从向美国一边倒的军需经济中寻找日本政治、经济的出路，这有很大的疑问。他希望日本人民能够在民族觉醒的精神下接受周恩来谈话的日子早日到来。
