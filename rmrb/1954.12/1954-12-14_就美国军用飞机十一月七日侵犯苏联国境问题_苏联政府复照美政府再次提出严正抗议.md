Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 13th: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a reply note from the Soviet government to the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union on December 11th, refuting the U.S. government's denial of the U.S. military aircraft's violation of Soviet airspace, and once again expressed the hope that the U.S. government would take necessary measures to prevent future incidents of U.S. aircraft violating Soviet airspace.

Following the intrusion of a U.S. B-29 type four-engine military aircraft into Soviet airspace in the area of Tanfilyev Island (in the Kuril Islands) on November 7th of this year, the Soviet government lodged a protest with the U.S. government. However, in its reply note of November 17th, the U.S. government insisted that the U.S. aircraft was shot down over Hokkaido, Japan, and that some of the southern islands of the Kuril Islands, where the incident occurred, were not Soviet territory. The U.S. government also stated that the U.S. aircraft did not open fire on Soviet aircraft and that the attack was initiated by Soviet aircraft.

The Soviet government's note of December 11th first cited the materials mentioned in the November 7th note to prove that the U.S. military aircraft violated Soviet airspace, and pointed out that when Soviet fighter planes approached the U.S. aircraft to indicate that it had entered Soviet territory and to demand its immediate departure, the U.S. aircraft opened fire on the Soviet aircraft. The note stated: This fact has been undoubtedly established, including through the evidence of relevant instruments.

In refuting the U.S. reply note's claim that some of the southern islands of the Kuril Islands were not Soviet territory, the Soviet note stated: It is well known that, according to the Allied agreement on Japan's surrender, the Soviet Union accepted Japan's surrender in the entire area of the Kuril Islands, and according to the decision of the Yalta Conference, the entire Kuril Islands were handed over to the Soviet Union. The directive of January 29, 1946, from the headquarters of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, MacArthur, also directly pointed out that Japan's sovereignty over these islands and other territories separated from Japan had been revoked.

The Soviet note said that taking measures to prevent U.S. aircraft from violating Soviet airspace in the future could avoid similar incidents and the resulting casualties. However, the U.S. government stated in its reply note that it would "guarantee necessary defense" for U.S. aircraft. This attitude of the U.S. government cannot help avoid similar incidents. Such actions by the U.S. military command can only increase the danger of similar incidents recurring, not to mention that such actions are contrary to the interests of easing international tensions.

    就美国军用飞机十一月七日侵犯苏联国境问题
    苏联政府复照美政府再次提出严正抗议
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部在十二月十一日把苏联政府的复照一件送交美国驻苏联大使馆，驳斥美国政府狡赖美国军用飞机侵犯苏联国境，并再次希望美国政府采取必要措施，以防止今后美国飞机侵犯苏联国境的事情发生。
    美国B—二十九型四引擎军用飞机一架今年十一月七日在坦非利耶夫岛（在千岛群岛）地区侵犯苏联国境后，苏联政府即向美国政府提出抗议。但是，美国政府在十一月十七日的复照中硬说美国飞机是在日本北海道上空被击落的，硬说发生美机事件的千岛群岛南部的某些岛不是苏联的领土。美国政府还说美国飞机没有开火射击苏联飞机，攻击是由苏联飞机开始的。
    苏联政府十二月十一日的照会首先引述了十一月七日照会中所提到的材料，来证明美国军用飞机侵犯苏联领空，并指出当苏联驱逐机飞近美国飞机，要想向它指明它已飞入苏联国境并要它立即离开时，美国飞机就向苏联飞机开火射击。照会说：这一事实已经确定无疑，其中包括有关的仪器的证明。
    在驳斥美国复照中所说的千岛群岛南部的某些岛不是苏联领土的说法时，苏联照会说：大家知道，根据盟国关于日本投降的协议，苏联在千岛群岛整个地区接受日本投降，根据雅尔达会议的决定，千岛群岛全部交给苏联。盟军最高统帅麦克阿瑟总部一九四六年一月二十九日的指令也直接指出，日本对这些岛屿和其他脱离日本的领土的主权已被取消。
    苏联照会说，采取措施防止美国飞机今后侵犯苏联国境，可以避免类似的事件和因此而造成的牺牲。但是，美国政府在复照中说它将为美国飞机“保证必要的防御”。美国政府的这种态度是不能有助于避免类似事件的。美军司令部的这种行动只能增加重演类似事件的危险，更不用说，这种行动是和缓和国际紧张局势的利益相抵触的。
