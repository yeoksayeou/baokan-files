Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: Many Chinese students in the United States are eager to return to their motherland, but are being forcibly detained by the U.S. government.

    According to a December 15th Agence France-Presse report, two Chinese students in California, Zhang Benshu (transliteration) and Han Yinggu (transliteration), said they had requested the U.S. government to allow them to return to China, but they received no response. They have requested the United Nations to help them return home. Zhang Benshu told reporters, "I hope to continue my teaching career in China, and I hope to see my wife and children."

    According to a December 17th United Press report, eight Chinese students in Massachusetts and the Chicago area stated on the 17th that they hoped to return to their motherland and reunite with their families. A student in Chicago, Han Chang (transliteration), said that the U.S. government should not detain him there. Four Chinese students in Massachusetts said that they hoped to return to China for a very personal reason, namely, to reunite with their families who are suffering from their departure.

    According to an Associated Press report on December 18th, Zhang Jiahua (transliteration) at Washington University in St. Louis and Xu Changdeng (transliteration) in Los Angeles both hope to return home and reunite with their families. Zhang Jiahua said that "all I hope for is to be with my family." Xu Changdeng said he "hopes to see my wife and children." But they have all been detained by the U.S. immigration authorities.

    These are just a few examples revealed in Western reporters' reports. The United Press report stated that "most Chinese students are unwilling to discuss their status." It is easy to see that the actual situation is that these students' demands to return to the embrace of their motherland have been suppressed. The U.S. immigration authorities' practice of forcibly detaining and pressuring students who rightfully request to return home has made many students afraid to express their desire to return to their motherland.

    The U.S. authorities and propaganda organs are also fabricating various excuses in an attempt to whitewash this arbitrary and unreasonable act of detaining students. However, even some American bourgeois newspapers cannot but admit that the U.S. authorities' approach is neither in line with common sense nor with internationally recognized norms. For example, the "Washington Star" believes that the reason put forward by the U.S. authorities for detaining students—because they have specialized skills that can work for their own country—is untenable, and it said: "In good conscience, this explanation is quite inadequate." The "Washington Post" also said: "According to international law, there is no reason to detain students, and this will inevitably give world public opinion a very bad impression."

    美国政府强扣热切要求回国的我留美学生
    【新华社二十日讯】许多在美国的中国留学生热切希望返回祖国，但被美国政府蛮横扣留。
    据法新社十五日报道，在加利福尼亚州的两名中国留学生张本树（译音）和韩应固（译音）说，他们曾经要求美国政府准许他们返回中国，可是他们没有得到任何答复。他们已经向联合国请求帮助他们回国。张本树对记者说：“我希望在中国继续我的教学事业，我希望看到我的妻子和孩子们。”
    据合众社十七日报道，在马萨诸塞州和芝加哥地区的八名中国留学生十七日表示，他们希望能回到祖国，同他们家人团聚。在芝加哥的一个留学生韩昌（译音）说，美国政府不应该把他拘留在那里。在马萨诸塞州的四个中国留学生说，他们希望回到中国，是出于一个非常近乎人情的理由，那就是，使他们跟由于他们的离开而正在痛苦着的家人团聚。
    据美联社十八日报道，在圣路易的华盛顿大学的张家哗（译音）和在洛杉矶的徐昌登（译音）都希望回国和他们的亲人团叙。张家哗说他“所希望的只是同我的家眷在一起”。徐昌登说他“希望见到我的妻子和孩子”。但他们都遭到美国移民当局的扣留。
    这些不过是西方记者的报道中透露出来的少数例子。合众社的消息中说“大多数中国学生不愿意讨论他们的地位”。很容易看得出来，实际情况是这些学生的返回祖国怀抱的要求受到了压抑。美国移民当局对正当地要求回国的留学生采取的强迫扣留和加施压力的作法使得许多留学生不敢表露他们回祖国的热望。
    美国当局和宣传机关还正在制造各种借口，企图粉饰扣留留学生这种专横无理的行径。但是连某些美国资产阶级的报纸也不能不承认，美国当局这种作法是既不合乎常情，也不合乎国际公认的准则的。例如，“华盛顿明星报”就认为美国当局提出来作为扣留留学生的理由——因为他们具有专门技术，能够替他们自己的祖国工作——是站不住脚的，它说：“必须凭良心说，这个解释是相当不充实的。”“华盛顿邮报”也说：“依照国际公法，没有理由扣留学生，而且这必然会给世界舆论一种十分恶劣的印象。”
