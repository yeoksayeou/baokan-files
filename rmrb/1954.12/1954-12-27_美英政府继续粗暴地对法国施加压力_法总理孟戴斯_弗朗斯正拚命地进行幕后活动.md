Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: On the eve of the French National Assembly's vote on December 27 regarding the question of confidence in the government proposed by Mendès France, the United States and British governments are continuing to rudely exert pressure on France, attempting to force the French National Assembly to change its decision to reject the plan to arm West Germany, and to approve the Paris Accords.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on December 25th, the United States is conducting frequent activities to change the result of the French National Assembly's vote on December 24th against rearming West Germany. US President Eisenhower conferred with Secretary of State Dulles again on December 25th. Dulles has been in constant contact with US Ambassador to France Dillon via transatlantic telephone, and Dillon has been constantly talking with French Prime Minister Mendès France.

The aforementioned Associated Press dispatch said that the policy currently adopted by American and British officials is to "not allow France to veto" the Paris Accords on rearming West Germany.

News of intimidation towards France has been transmitted from Washington, saying that if the French National Assembly maintains its decision to reject the plan to arm West Germany on December 27th, the United States and Britain are prepared to immediately conduct consultations and arm West Germany on their own, regardless of France's opinion. Another threat is: if France rejects the Paris Accords, the United States will re-examine the issue of "dollar aid" to France.

Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: Paris dispatch: According to a United Press report, French Prime Minister Mendès France on December 25th "is buying time and frantically conducting behind-the-scenes activities against the tide of anti-German rearmament sentiment in the French National Assembly."

Mendès France is attempting to influence some members of the French National Assembly to vote for a vote of confidence in the government on the 27th, in favor of the Paris Accords.

The report said that Mendès France is doing this not only because he needs to obtain twenty-two more votes than he did in the vote on the 24th in order to get the National Assembly to approve the part of the already rejected Paris Accords concerning the arming of West Germany, but also because he is even more worried that during the Christmas holiday, many members of parliament will return to their constituencies, where they will be subject to new influences from voters who are strongly opposed to rearming West Germany.

    美英政府继续粗暴地对法国施加压力
    法总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯正拚命地进行幕后活动
    【新华社二十六日讯】在法国国民议会二十七日将要就孟戴斯—弗朗斯提出的对政府信任问题进行表决的前夕，美国和英国政府正继续粗暴地对法国施加压力，企图迫使法国国民议会改变关于拒绝武装西德计划的决定，而批准巴黎协定。
    据美联社华盛顿二十五日消息说，为了改变法国国民议会二十四日反对重新武装西德的表决结果，美国正进行着频繁的活动。美国总统艾森豪威尔二十五日又和国务卿杜勒斯进行了商谈。杜勒斯用横穿大西洋的电话一直同美国驻法国大使狄龙保持联系，狄龙则不断地在同法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯谈话。
    美联社上述消息说，美国和英国官员目前采取的方针是“不容许法国否决掉”重新武装西德的巴黎协定。
    华盛顿传出向法国实行恫吓的消息说，如果法国国民议会在二十七日维持拒绝武装西德计划的决定，美国和英国已准备好立即进行商谈，不顾法国的意见而径自武装西德。另外的威胁是：如果法国拒绝巴黎协定，美国就要重新审查给予法国的“美元援助”问题。
    【新华社二十六日讯】巴黎消息：据合众社消息说，法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯二十五日“争取时间，并且逆着法国国民议会中反对重新武装德国的情绪的潮流，拚命进行幕后活动。”
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯企图影响一部分法国国民议会议员，使他们在二十七日举行的表决中对政府投信任票，赞成巴黎协定。
    消息说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯这样活动，不仅是因为他要使国民议会批准已被否决的巴黎协定中关于武装西德的部分，需要比二十四日表决时多获得二十二票，而且，使得他更加担心的是，在圣诞节假期中，许多议员返回到他们的选区，他们要受到强烈反对重新武装西德的选民们的新的影响。
