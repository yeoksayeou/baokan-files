Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 29th: French Prime Minister Mendes-France, at the National Assembly session on the morning of the 28th, in addition to requesting a vote of confidence in the government regarding the approval of the Paris Agreement bill (excluding Article 1 concerning the rearmament of West Germany and its accession to the Western European Union), subsequently requested a vote of confidence regarding the rearmament of West Germany and its accession to the Western European Union.

Since the National Assembly had already rejected Article 1 of the Paris Agreement bill on the 24th, and the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee opposed Mendes-France's proposal on the 27th to conduct a second reading vote on Article 1 in the National Assembly, Mendes-France played a new trick. In order to bypass the complex parliamentary procedures required for a second reading of the original Article 1, Mendes-France proposed a restyled "new" bill, which in essence requested approval of the original Article 1 concerning the protocols for the rearmament of West Germany and its accession to the Western European Union. The bill also added two provisions: stipulating that small committees should be established in the National Assembly and the French Senate, and that the government must consult with these two small committees in peacetime before increasing the number of armed forces stipulated in the Paris Agreement; and stipulating that the protocols of the Paris Agreement should be regarded as an indivisible whole and must come into effect simultaneously.

After proposing the "new" bill, Mendes-France submitted it to the Foreign Affairs Committee for consideration. The Foreign Affairs Committee passed the bill by a majority of one vote (18 votes in favor, 17 against, and 4 abstentions).

Subsequently, Mendes-France submitted the "new" bill to the National Assembly. Without allowing the National Assembly to discuss the "new" bill, he attempted to prevent the bill from being rejected again, immediately raised the question of confidence, and hoped to use a vote of confidence again to coerce the parliament to pass the bill.

The vote of confidence on this bill was held on the afternoon of the 29th.

At the meeting on the morning of the 28th, parliamentarian Rustono-Lago also proposed an amendment to Mendes-France's "new" bill. This amendment suggested that the approved protocols on the rearmament of West Germany should not take effect until Mendes-France had negotiated with the Soviet Union and informed the National Assembly and the French Senate of the results.

    孟戴斯—弗朗斯又在法国议会中玩弄花样
    要挟法国议会通过改头换面的巴黎协定第一条
    【新华社二十九日讯】　巴黎消息：法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯在二十八日清晨的国民议会会议上除了提出要求就批准巴黎协定法案（不包括重新武装西德和使西德加入西欧联盟的第一条）举行对政府的信任投票外，随后又要求就重新武装西德和使西德加入西欧联盟的问题举行信任投票。
    由于国民议会已在二十四日否决了巴黎协定法案第一条，国民议会外交委员会二十七日又反对孟戴斯—弗朗斯提出的在国民议会对第一条进行二读表决的建议，孟戴斯—弗朗斯就玩弄了一个新的花样。孟戴斯—弗朗斯为了绕过就原来第一条进行二读所必需的繁复议会程序手续，提出了一个改头换面的“新”法案，这个“新”法案实质上也就是要求批准原来第一条中关于重新武装西德和使它加入西欧联盟的议定书。法案中又附加了两项规定：规定在国民议会和法国参议院分别设立小组委员会，在和平时期政府须事先征求上述两个小组委员会的意见才能增加在巴黎协定中规定的武装部队数目；同时规定把巴黎协定各议定书作为一个不可分割的整体，必须同时生效。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯在提出“新”法案后，曾经把这个法案提交外交委员会考虑。外交委员会以一票的多数（十八票赞成，十七票反对，四票弃权）通过了这个法案。
    接着，孟戴斯—弗朗斯就把“新”法案提到国民议会。他根本没有让国民议会对“新”法案进行讨论，他企图使这个法案不再遭到否决，就马上提出了信任问题，希望再用信任投票来要挟议会通过这个法案。
    关于这个法案的信任投票，在二十九日下午举行。
    在二十八日清晨的会议上，议员鲁斯多诺—拉果又对孟戴斯—弗朗斯的“新”法案提出了一项修正案。这项修正案建议在孟戴斯—弗朗斯同苏联谈判并且把结果告诉国民议会和法国参议院以前，不使得到批准的关于重新武装西德的各项议定书生效。
