Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 26th: According to the Indian Information Service on the 25th, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, on the eve of his departure for Indonesia to attend the Bogor Conference, told the press in Shantiniketan, West Bengal, on the 24th that both the Colombo Conference and the upcoming South Asian Five-Nation Prime Ministers' Conference in Bogor were of great significance in themselves. They demonstrate that Asian countries are playing a role in world affairs, especially in Asian issues. It has become increasingly clear that Asian issues cannot be resolved by non-Asian countries without regard for Asian countries.

Nehru said that the Prime Ministers of the five South Asian countries will discuss the details of convening the Asian-African Conference at the Bogor Conference. He said that such a conference requires a great deal of preparation in all aspects. He also said that the Prime Ministers of the five South Asian countries will also discuss some new developments in the world situation, especially some new developments related to Asia.

Nehru said: "In the past few years, Asia has undergone many major changes due to the emergence of some independent countries and due to the new balance being formed between Asia and Europe. Non-Asian countries are finally beginning to recognize these new developments. Asian countries are committed to peace not only in their overall views, but also through the forces of circumstances. Their entire future, progress and development depend on the continued existence of peace. Thus, peace is not only their hope, but also an urgent need. However, peace does not depend solely on Asian countries, but also on other countries." He said: "All we can do is do our best to strengthen the forces of peace."

Nehru believes that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence apply to all countries, including Pakistan.

    尼赫鲁谈南亚五国总理会议的意义
    【新华社新德里二十六日电】据印度新闻处二十五日消息，印度总理尼赫鲁在前往印度尼西亚参加茂物会议的前夕，于二十四日在西孟加拉省的山提尼克坦对报界说，科伦坡会议和即将在茂物举行的南亚五国总理会议本身都具有重要意义，它们显示出，亚洲国家在世界事务中、尤其是在亚洲问题上起着作用。已经越来越明显，亚洲问题是不可能由非亚洲国家在不顾亚洲国家的情况下解决的。
    尼赫鲁说，南亚五国总理将在茂物会议中讨论关于召开亚非会议的细节问题。他说，这种会议要求在各方面进行许多准备工作。他并说，南亚五国的总理们还将讨论世界局势的一些新发展，特别是有关亚洲方面的一些新发展。
    尼赫鲁说：“在过去几年中，由于一些独立国家的出现以及由于亚洲和欧洲之间正在形成的新的均势，亚洲发生了许多大变化。非亚洲国家终于开始认识到这些新的发展。亚洲国家不仅是以它们的总的观点、而且是通过环境的力量来致力于和平的。它们的整个前途、进步和发展都要依靠和平的继续存在。这样，和平就不仅是它们的希望，而且也是迫切的需要。但是，和平并不仅仅依靠亚洲国家，还要依靠其他国家。”他说：“我们所能做的就是尽我们最大的力量来加强和平的力量。”
    尼赫鲁认为和平共处的五项原则适用于一切国家，包括巴基斯坦在内。
