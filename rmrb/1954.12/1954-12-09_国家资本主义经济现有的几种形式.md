Several Existing Forms of State Capitalist Economy
    Tong Ming

In recent years, due to the correct implementation of the policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state, China's state capitalist economy has greatly developed. In the process of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, various forms of state capitalist economy have been created.

The diversity of state capitalist economic forms is one of the characteristics of China's state capitalist economy. This is determined by China's specific economic situation and the state's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce. For China's extremely complex capitalist industry and commerce, it is necessary to adopt different forms of state capitalism according to the needs of the state and the specific conditions of transformation of industries and enterprises, in order to gradually realize the socialist transformation of various capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises.

Here, I will briefly explain the several main forms of state capitalism that already exist.

    I. The Advanced Form of State Capitalism in Industry—Joint State-Private Ownership

Joint state-private enterprises are enterprises in which the state or a certain joint state-private enterprise invests in private enterprises, and the state sends cadres to cooperate with capitalists in joint management. The establishment of joint state-private enterprises must be approved by the People's Government in accordance with the prescribed procedures.

In China, the transformation of capitalist industry will mainly be carried out through joint state-private ownership. In order to encourage and guide capitalist enterprises to transform into joint state-private enterprises, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises" in September 1954.

Joint state-private enterprises are a cooperation between socialist and capitalist components within the enterprise, with the socialist component in a leading position. The management of joint state-private enterprises must be under the leadership of the public side, with representatives from both the public and private sides responsible. The relationship between the public and private sides specifically embodies the relationship between leadership and being led. The production and sales of joint state-private enterprises should be carried out in accordance with national plans. The enterprise's production, finance, labor, capital construction, safety and health systems must also comply with the regulations of the People's Government.

In joint state-private enterprises, the legitimate rights and interests of the private side are protected. Private representatives have certain positions in joint state-private enterprises, and many private representatives hold important administrative or production positions. They have both authority and responsibility. Of course, they must also perform their duties and responsibilities and must not engage in self-seeking at the expense of the public interest. Capitalists and their agents, in cooperation with socialist components, under the leadership of the public side, through production practice, receive direct education and transformation, and are given full opportunities to display their management talents and technology. According to the "Provisional Regulations on Joint State-Private Industrial Enterprises," the private side can also receive reasonable profits.

Because there are both socialist and capitalist components within joint state-private enterprises, the contradiction between the public and private sides is the main contradiction in joint state-private enterprises. Issues related to the relationship between the public and private sides in joint state-private enterprises are handled through consultation between representatives of both sides. If the consultation fails, it should be submitted to the competent authority of the People's Government for resolution. A system of worker representatives participating in management should be implemented in joint state-private enterprises. The relationship between workers and enterprise administration is no longer a simple labor-capital relationship. Here, the position of workers is consistent with that of the public representatives. However, there are still private shares in joint state-private enterprises, and capitalists still exploit the surplus labor of workers. Therefore, the labor-capital relationship still partially exists; however, in these enterprises, the labor-capital relationship is mainly expressed through the public-private relationship, that is to say, some issues related to the labor-capital relationship can be resolved through public-private consultation.

There are three conditions for private industrial enterprises to undergo joint state-private ownership: the needs of the state, the possibility of enterprise transformation, and the willingness of capitalists. That is to say, the joint state-private ownership of capitalist enterprises should be based on the unified plan of the state. At the same time, the enterprise itself must have certain conditions, such as gradually creating the conditions for incorporating supply, production, and sales into the national plan through intermediate forms of state capitalism such as processing, ordering, and exclusive sales; laying a preliminary foundation for enterprise transformation through the movement to increase production and practice economy, democratic reform, and production reform; some small private industries can also steadily carry out combination or merger under the leadership of the People's Government on the basis of cooperation and interdependence between each other or between them and some larger industries, in order to create conditions for joint state-private ownership. In addition, attention should be paid to inspiring the willingness of capitalists to engage in joint state-private ownership, that is to say, they should be made aware of and demand joint state-private ownership through the propaganda and education work of the government and relevant parties.

Joint state-private enterprises have significant advantages over capitalist and other forms of state capitalist enterprises. This is mainly because their production relations have undergone important changes: the enterprise has changed from private to joint public-private ownership, and capitalist ownership has lost its original control over the means of production; the status of workers has changed, and the public side and the worker masses are combined to become the leading force in enterprise production and management, directly supervising and promoting the transformation of the enterprise. In addition to a small portion of profits for private shares, most of the enterprise's profits become the accumulation of national construction funds, and a portion also becomes the source of employee welfare. The production and sales of enterprises are also basically incorporated into the national plan. In this way, labor-capital contradictions and public-private contradictions can be handled more appropriately and effectively, thereby increasing labor productivity, increasing the quantity of products, improving product quality, reducing product costs, and gradually catching up with comparable state-owned enterprises; it can more effectively improve production, accumulate funds, expand reproduction in a planned way, develop social productive forces, and support national socialist industrialization; it can also train more technical workers, technical cadres, and management cadres, and transform capitalists and their agents, which prepares more complete conditions for these enterprises to eventually transform into socialist enterprises.

    II. Other Forms of State Capitalism in Industry

In addition to the advanced form of joint state-private ownership, state capitalism in industry currently also includes intermediate forms such as processing, ordering, and exclusive sales, and low-level forms such as purchasing.

Processing: This refers to state-owned enterprises (or cooperatives) supplying part or all of the raw materials (or semi-finished products, parts), determining raw material quotas, and entrusting private factories to produce within a certain period of time according to the specifications, quality, and quantity stipulated by the state. All finished products from processing are recovered by the state, and the state provides private factories with reasonable processing fees (or processing charges) as stipulated.

Ordering: This refers to state-owned enterprises (or cooperatives) pre-ordering a certain quantity of products from private factories at reasonable prices. The private factories then produce according to the product standards (specifications, quality, etc.) stipulated by the state and deliver the goods within the stipulated period.

Exclusive Sales: This refers to state-owned commercial enterprises stipulating the product standards of private factories, or, on the condition that their products maintain certain standards, agreeing with the factory on prices, and for a considerable period of time, with an industry, a product, or an enterprise as the target, the state contracting for part or all of the products it produces. The products contracted in this way must all be sold to the state. In specific implementation, methods similar to processing or ordering are often adopted. The difference between this and processing or ordering is that products increased or over-produced due to production improvements in the exclusive sales part should, in principle, also be sold to the state according to the needs of the state.

Advanced forms of joint state-private enterprises are developing, but currently account for a small proportion of capitalist industry; the proportion of low-level forms of purchasing has gradually decreased; intermediate forms of processing and ordering currently account for an overwhelming proportion of capitalist industry.

Processing and ordering are cooperation between the socialist economy and the capitalist economy outside the enterprise. This cooperation is generally manifested in various forms of contracts between the public and private sectors—processing contracts, ordering contracts, exclusive sales contracts. The contracts between the public and private sectors are not ordinary sales contracts, but a specific form that embodies the public-private relationship and the relationship between leadership and being led between the socialist economy and the capitalist economy. The state guides the production of private industry according to the contract, and the workers supervise the operation of the capitalists according to the contract.

Processing and ordering have a wide range of applications. Through these two forms of state capitalism, the positive role of private industry can be widely utilized and transformed. Processing and ordering have now been gradually implemented for small enterprises and handicraft industries. In addition, the reorganization or combination of many enterprises can be promoted through processing and ordering. For example, many factories that could only produce parts or engage in repair work in the past have implemented a system of specialized division of labor in processing and ordering, and can now produce complete products; many products that they could not produce in the past have been produced new products in processing and ordering due to the specific guidance and assistance of state-owned enterprises.

For state capitalist enterprises that accept processing and ordering, the state can send personnel to supervise them, and state banks can conduct financial supervision or financial management on them, while industrial and commercial administrative agencies conduct administrative management on them. The close cooperation between the supervision of workers within the enterprise and the supervision of state organs outside the enterprise is an important link in implementing processing and ordering contracts and restricting the negative effects of capitalism. At present, the phenomena of failure to deliver goods on time, according to quality, and according to quantity, as well as cutting corners, stealing state property, and evading taxes are still quite common in processing and ordering enterprises. With the expansion of the scope and quantity of processing and ordering, supervision and management must be further strengthened.

The state capitalist form of processing and ordering has not changed the capitalist ownership of private industry, but has only restricted it to varying degrees. The main characteristics of processing and ordering are that the socialist component controls the production and sales of private industry to varying degrees. Because its production is subject to a certain degree of planned control, the blindness of production is weakened; because the distribution of these commodities is controlled, the speculative nature of private industry is restricted; because the state stipulates certain processing fees or freight prices under the condition that capitalists have reasonable profits, capitalist exploitation is restricted.

However, in processing and ordering enterprises, because the means of production and part of the means of production are still owned by the capitalists, and the enterprise is basically managed in a capitalist way, the public-private contradictions and labor-capital contradictions in the enterprise cannot be resolved smoothly and effectively, which affects the further improvement of labor productivity. At the same time, it also restricts the education and transformation of capitalists and their agents. The development of various contradictions within the enterprise requires that various intermediate forms of state capitalism be gradually developed into advanced forms—joint state-private ownership.

The low-level form of state capitalism in industry is purchasing. This refers to state-owned commercial enterprises implementing temporary or regular purchases of a certain quantity of products from private factories at reasonable prices under certain conditions (such as product specifications, quality, etc.). The means of production of this type of enterprise are still completely owned by the capitalists. The only difference between purchasing and private capitalism is that it separates itself from the free market in the sales of some products. The connection and cooperation between this low-level form of state capitalism and the socialist economy is unstable. Therefore, these enterprises must further develop towards higher-level forms of state capitalism in order to be better transformed.

    III. Various Forms of State Capitalism in Commerce

With the development of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, state capitalism in commerce has also developed considerably recently.

The state's transformation of private commerce will mainly be carried out industry by industry. The planned purchase and planned supply of grain, oil, and cotton cloth has begun to create some experience in this regard. When a certain commodity is entirely or mostly controlled by the state, private retailers operating in this commodity can be transformed into state-owned commercial distribution stores or consignment stores across the entire industry. In this way, distribution and consignment sales have become the main forms of state capitalism in commerce.

Distribution: This refers to state-owned companies designating commodities and signing contracts with private stores in accordance with the supply plan of state-owned companies. Private stores purchase goods from state-owned companies with cash and sell them at the unified prices set by the state. Private stores obtain profit from the price difference in distribution. The commodities distributed are usually commodities that are entirely or mostly controlled by the state.

Consignment Sales: This refers to state-owned companies entrusting private stores to sell commodities that are entirely or mostly controlled by the state in accordance with the supply plan and prices stipulated by state-owned companies, according to the needs of the local people and the establishment of state-owned and cooperative commercial networks. After accepting consignment sales tasks, private stores should pay a certain deposit and obtain a certain handling fee in consignment sales.

State capitalism in commerce also has the following forms:

Wholesale-Retail (批销): This is an abbreviation for wholesale purchases and retail sales. It refers to private stores purchasing goods from local state-owned companies with cash and selling them at the prices set by state-owned companies or the approved prices. Private merchants obtain profit from the price difference.

Commissioned Purchase (代购): This refers to state-owned companies signing agreements with private stores, designating varieties, specifications, quantities, and prices, and entrusting private merchants to purchase on their behalf, with the state paying a handling fee. This form is mostly used for the procurement of foreign imported goods and local specialties.

Joint Public-Private Purchase (公私联购): This refers to state-owned companies and cooperatives stipulating varieties, quantities, prices, etc., according to the state's purchase plan, and organizing private merchants to purchase in production areas at a certain public-private ratio. In this way, the manpower and funds of private merchants can be used to serve the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas under the leadership of state-owned commerce or cooperative commerce.

Commissioned purchase and joint public-private purchase are generally non-regular and non-fixed forms of state capitalism.

Among the current forms of state capitalism in commerce, there are also a small number of joint state-private enterprises. Individual stores that are needed by the state and have certain technical skills can also be transformed into them through joint state-private ownership if they meet certain conditions. However, due to the excessive dispersion of private commerce, this form will not have great development in commerce.

State capitalism in commerce is generally realized through the form of public-private contracts or agreements. This public-private contract or agreement is a specific form that embodies the public-private relationship and the relationship between leadership and being led.

From the above description, it can be seen that the characteristics of various forms of state capitalism in commerce are, first, that state-owned commerce basically controls the source of goods for private commerce, and second, that it controls its selling prices. In this way, the exploitation and speculation of private merchants are restricted to varying degrees; and state-owned economy gradually grasps the main links of commodity circulation, that is, the circulation between regions and the wholesale links, so as to be conducive to completing the state's commodity circulation plan, ensuring supply and stabilizing the market; in this way, it is also possible to gradually sever the connection between capitalist commerce and producers, thereby facilitating the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry.

The targets of state capitalism in commerce are mainly capitalist retailers. Utilizing the commercial networks, commercial personnel, and funds of capitalist retailers, and carrying out socialist transformation through the form of state capitalism under the leadership of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce is an important task in the transitional period of the state. In large cities, a portion of wholesalers who meet the conditions can also be incorporated into the orbit of state capitalism as wholesale agency stores of state-owned commerce according to the needs of the state; however, the vast majority of wholesalers cannot be incorporated into the form of state capitalism. Because wholesale commerce is directly connected to producers and retailers, it is highly speculative. Therefore, state-owned commerce must control the wholesale link in order to control the distribution of commodities, ensure supply, stabilize the market, and better serve production and consumers. Therefore, private wholesalers will be replaced by state-owned commerce in the process of socialist transformation. Those who meet the conditions for changing jobs can be guided to change jobs. For their employees and actual managers of the capital side, if they have no other legitimate means of making a living and are willing to obey the state's allocation, they can be organized for training and assisted in employment in a planned way. As for the original funds of the enterprise, capitalists should also be guided to invest in undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

    国家资本主义经济现有的几种形式
    同明
    几年来，由于国家正确地贯彻了对资本主义工商业的利用、限制和改造政策，我国国家资本主义经济已有了很大的发展；在对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造过程中，创造了多种多样的国家资本主义经济形式。
    国家资本主义经济形式的多样性，是我国国家资本主义经济的特点之一。这是由于中国的具体经济情况和国家对资本主义工商业利用、限制、改造的政策所决定的。对于我国情况极为复杂的资本主义工商业，需要依据国家的需要和行业、企业的改造条件等具体情况，采取不同的国家资本主义形式，逐步实现对各种资本主义工商企业的社会主义改造。
    这里将已经存在的几种主要的国家资本主义形式加以概略的说明。
    一、工业中的国家资本主义的
        高级形式—公私合营
    公私合营企业是由国家或某一公私合营企业向私营企业投资、并由国家派干部，同资本家实行合营的企业。公私合营企业的设立，须经人民政府依规定的程序核准。
    在我国，对资本主义工业的改造将主要通过公私合营来进行。为了鼓励和指导资本主义企业转变为公私合营企业，中央人民政府政务院已于一九五四年九月公布了公私合营工业企业暂行条例。
    公私合营企业是社会主义成分同资本主义成分在企业内部的合作，社会主义成分居于领导地位。公私合营企业的经营管理，必须在公方领导之下，由公方代表同私方代表负责；公方和私方的关系，具体体现着领导和被领导的关系。公私合营企业的生产和销售，应该按照国家的计划进行。企业的生产、财务、劳动、基本建设、安全卫生等制度，也必须遵照人民政府的规定办理。
    在公私合营企业中，私方的合法权益是受到保护的。私方代表在公私合营企业中有其一定的职位，许多私方代表并担负了行政上或生产上的重要职务，他们是有职有权的。当然，他们也必须守职尽责，不能假公济私。资本家和资本家代理人在同社会主义成分合作中，在公方领导下，通过生产实践，受到直接的教育和改造，得到充分发挥他们的管理才能和技术的机会。依照公私合营工业企业暂行条例的规定，私方并可以分得合理的盈余。
    公私合营企业内部既有社会主义成分，又有资本主义成分，因此，公私矛盾是公私合营企业中的主要矛盾。公私合营企业中有关公私关系的问题，由公私双方代表协商处理。协商不能一致时，报请人民政府主管机关解决。在公私合营企业中应实行工人代表参加管理的制度。工人同企业行政的关系，已不是单纯的劳资关系，在这里，工人和公方代表的立场是一致的。但是，公私合营企业中还有私股存在，资本家还剥削工人的剩余劳动，因此，劳资关系仍然部分地存在；不过在这些企业中，劳资关系主要地是通过公私关系来表现，也就是说，有关劳资关系的一些问题，可通过公私协商来解决。
    私营工业进行公私合营要有三方面的条件，就是国家的需要、企业改造的可能和资本家的自愿。这就是说，对资本主义企业进行公私合营，应当根据国家的统一计划。同时，企业本身必须具备一定的条件，例如通过加工、订货、包销等国家资本主义的中级形式，逐步创造了供、产、销纳入国家计划的条件，通过增产节约运动、民主改革和生产改革运动，打下企业改造的初步基础，某些小型的私营工业，并可在彼此之间、或它们同某些较大工业之间的协作和依存关系的基础上，在人民政府领导之下，稳步地进行组合或并厂，以创造公私合营的条件。此外，对企业进行公私合营，应当注意启发资本家的自愿，也就是说，要通过政府和有关方面的宣传教育工作，使他们对于合营有所认识和要求。
    公私合营企业比之资本主义和其他形式的国家资本主义企业有着显著的优越性，这主要是因为它的生产关系发生了重要的变化：企业由私有变为公私共有，资本主义所有制丧失其对生产资料的原有支配地位；工人的地位改变了，公方和工人群众结合在一起，成为企业生产经营的领导力量，直接监督和推进企业的改造。企业利润，除少部分的私股利润外，大部分成为国家建设资金的积累，也有一部分成为职工福利的来源。企业的生产和销售也基本上纳入国家计划。这样，劳资矛盾和公私矛盾，就能够获得更适当、更有效的处理，从而能够提高劳动生产率，增加产品数量，提高产品质量，降低产品成本，逐步向相当的国营企业看齐；能够更有效地改进生产，积累资金，有计划地扩大再生产，发展社会生产力，支持国家社会主义工业化；也能够培养更多的技术工人、技术干部和管理干部，并改造资本家及资本家代理人，这就为这些企业最后转变为社会主义企业准备了比较完备的条件。
  二、工业中的国家资本主义的
        其他形式
    工业中的国家资本主义除高级形式的公私合营外，目前还有中级形式的加工、订货、包销和低级的收购等形式。
    加工，这是由国营企业（或合作社）供给一部分或全部原料（或半成品、零件），确定原材料定额，委托私营工厂在一定时期内按照国家所规定的规格、质量、数量进行生产。加工的全部成品均由国家收回，国家则按规定给予私营工厂以合理的工缴（或称加工费）。
    订货，这是国营企业（或合作社）以合理的货价向私营工厂预先订购一定数量的产品，私营工厂即依国家规定的产品标准（规格、质量等）进行生产，并按规定的时期交货。
    包销，是由国营商业规定私营工厂的产品标准，或在其产品保持一定的标准的条件下，同厂方协议，确定价格，在相当时期内，以一个行业、一种产品或一个企业为对象，由国家包下其所生产的产品的一部或全部。这样包下来的产品必须全部卖给国家。在具体执行时，也时常采取加工、订货或近似于加工、订货的方式，其与加工、订货不同的是，包销部分因生产改进而增加或超额生产的产品，原则上也应按照国家需要卖给国家。
    高级形式的公私合营企业正在发展中，但目前在资本主义工业中所占的比重还小；低级形式的收购所占的比重已逐渐下降；中级形式的加工、订货目前在资本主义工业中占有绝大的比重。
    加工、订货是社会主义经济和资本主义经济在企业外部的合作。这种合作，一般是表现为各种公私之间的合同形式——加工合同、订货合同、包销合同。公私之间的合同不是普通的买卖合同，而是体现公私关系、体现社会主义经济同资本主义经济之间的领导和被领导关系的具体形式。国家根据合同指导私营工业的生产，工人根据合同监督资本家的经营。
    加工、订货的适用范围较广，通过这两种国家资本主义的形式，可以较广泛地利用私营工业的积极作用，并对它们进行改造。现在对小型企业、工场手工业也已逐步地推行了加工、订货。此外对很多企业，并可通过加工、订货来促进它们的改组或组合，例如很多过去只能生产零件或从事修理工作的工厂，在加工、订货中，实行了专业分工的办法，便能生产完整的产品；很多过去它们所不能生产的产品，在加工、订货中由于得到国营企业的具体指导和帮助，生产了新的产品。
    对于接受加工、订货的国家资本主义企业，国家可以派员进行监督，国家银行并可对它们进行财务监督或财务管理，工商行政机关则对它们进行行政的管理。工人在企业内部的监督和国家机关在企业外部的监督两者密切配合，是贯彻执行加工、订货合同，限制资本主义消极作用的重要环节。目前在加工、订货的企业中，不能按质、按量、按期交货，以及偷工减料、盗窃国家财产、偷税漏税等现象还是相当普遍的。随着加工、订货范围和数量的扩大，监督管理也就必须进一步加强。
    加工、订货的国家资本主义形式并未改变私营工业的资本家所有制，只是给它以不同程度的限制。加工、订货的主要特点是，社会主义成分在不同程度上控制了私营工业的生产和销售，由于它的生产受一定程度的计划支配，从而削弱了生产的盲目性；由于控制了这些商品的分配，从而限制了私营工业的投机性；由于国家在使资本家有合理利润可得的情况下规定了一定的工缴或货价，从而限制了资本主义剥削。
    但是在加工、订货的企业中，因为生产工具和一部分生产资料仍为资本家所有，企业基本上还是按照资本主义方式管理，这就使得企业中的公私矛盾和劳资矛盾往往不能顺利地有效地解决，影响着劳动生产率的进一步提高，同时，也就限制了对资本家及资本家代理人的教育和改造，企业内部各种矛盾的发展，就要求将国家资本主义的各种中级形式逐步发展为高级形式——公私合营。
      工业中国家资本主义的低级形式有收购。这是在一定的条件下（如产品规格、质量等），国营商业以合理的价格，对私营工厂一定数量的产品实行临时性或定期性的收购。这种企业的生产资料还完全是资本家所有，收购与私人资本主义不同的只是它在部分产品的销售上脱离了自由市场。这种低级形式的国家资本主义与社会主义经济的联系和合作是不稳固的，因此，这些企业要进一步向较高级形式的国家资本主义发展，才能更好地获得改造。
  三、商业中的国家资本主义
      的各种形式
    商业中的国家资本主义，随着国营商业和合作社商业的发展，最近也已有了相当的发展。
    国家对于私营商业的改造，将主要地采取逐行逐业地进行的方式，粮食、油料、棉布的计划收购和计划供应，已在这方面开始创造了一些经验。在某种商品已全部或绝大部分为国家所掌握的情况下，经营这种商品的私营零售商就可以全业性地被改造成为国营商业的经销店或代销店。这样，经销和代销就成为商业方面主要的国家资本主义形式。
    经销，这是国营公司指定商品，并按照国营公司供应计划与私营商店订立合同，私营商店以现款向国营公司进货，并按国家统一的牌价出售。私营商店在经销中获取差价利润。经销的商品对象通常是国家已全部或大部掌握了的商品。
    代销，是国营公司根据当地人民的需要和国营和合作社商业网设置的情况，把国家已全部或大部分掌握的商品委托私营商店遵照国营公司规定的供应计划和牌价出售。私营商店在接受代销任务后，应缴存一定的保证金，并在代销中获取一定的手续费。
    商业方面的国家资本主义，还有如下几种形式：
    批销，这是批购零销的简称。是私营商店向当地国营公司以现款批购商品，并按照国营公司牌价或核定的价格出售。私商获取差价利润。
    代购，这是国营公司根据需要，指定品种、规格、数量和价格，同私营商店订立协议，由私商代为收购，国家付以手续费。这种形式大多行之于国外进口物资和土特产的采购。
    公私联购，这是国营公司和合作社根据国家收购计划，规定品种、数量、价格等，按一定的公私比例组织私商到产区去收购。这样就可以在国营商业或合作社商业的领导下，利用私商的人力和资金为城乡物资交流服务。
    代购和公私联购一般是不经常的、不固定的国家资本主义形式。
    目前商业的国家资本主义形式中，也有少数的公私合营企业。个别为国家需要和带有一定技术性的商店，在具备了一定条件的情况下，也可以以公私合营的方式对它们进行改造。但由于私营商业的过于分散等原因，这种形式在商业中不会有很大的发展。
    商业方面的国家资本主义一般也是通过公私合同或协议的形式而实现的，这种公私合同或协议，是体现公私关系、体现领导与被领导关系的具体形式。
    从以上的说明中可以看出：商业中各种形式的国家资本主义的特点，首先是国营商业基本上控制了私营商业的货源，其次是控制了其出售价格。这样，就在不同程度上限制了私商的剥削和投机行为；并使国营经济逐步地掌握了商品流通的主要环节，即地区间的流转和批发环节，从而有利于完成国家的商品流通计划，保证供应和稳定市场；这样，也就可以逐步割断资本主义商业同生产者之间的联系，从而也就有利于对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工业的社会主义改造。
    商业中国家资本主义的对象主要是资本主义零售商。利用资本主义零售商的商业网，商业人员和资金，在国营商业和合作社商业的领导下，通过国家资本主义的形式对它们进行社会主义改造，这是国家过渡时期的一项重要工作。在大城市中，也可以根据国家的需要将一部分有条件的批发商纳入国家资本主义的轨道，成为国营商业的批发代理店；但是绝大部分批发商是不能纳入国家资本主义的形式的。因为批发商业直接同生产者联系，又同零售商联系，投机性很大，因此必须由国营商业掌握批发环节，才能控制商品的分配，保证供应、稳定市场，更好地为生产和消费者服务。因此，在社会主义改造的过程中，私营批发商将会被国营商业所代替。他们之中有条件转业的，可以指导他们转业，无转业条件的，对其职工和资方实职人员，如果他们没有别的正当谋生之路，自己又愿意服从国家调配的，可以有计划地组织训练并辅导他们就业，至于企业原有的资金，亦应引导资本家投入有利于国计民生的事业。
