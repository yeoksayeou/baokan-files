Title: Transportation Departments Should Save Fabric Used for "Feizi"

A reader, Xu Shulin, writes: Currently, some transportation departments use cloth-printed labels (commonly known as "feizi") to identify goods. Some units use very good quality cloth for these feizi. If each feizi requires six square inches of cloth, and each item has two feizi attached, then 10,000 items will require 12,000 square feet of cloth. If we add up the amount of cloth used by all transportation units across the country to make feizi, the quantity is staggering. This not only wastes cotton cloth but also increases transportation costs. It is suggested that all transportation units pay attention to this issue and consider changing the cloth feizi used for transporting goods to paper ones.

Is it Boasting About Achievements, or Supporting Workers' Creativity?

Comrade Editor:

In September, at the Jilin Railway Bureau's Advanced Workers Representative Conference exhibition, in the vehicle pavilion, there was a "multi-head screw threading machine." The commentator constantly explained to visitors: "This was created by veteran worker Wang Engui and others from the Jilin Vehicle Depot. In the past, one machine could only turn one screw rod at a time, but now it can turn eight at a time."

The railway workers in the Jilin area are already quite familiar with this machine. Since February of this year, the Jilin Vehicle Depot's Party General Branch and trade union have continuously mentioned it in summaries, reports, and special reports. Later, the CPC Jilin Railway District Committee, the Jilin Railway Transportation Sub-bureau Political Department Organization Section, and the China Railway Trade Union Jilin Partition Committee also talked about this matter when reporting to higher authorities. From April to the end of July, this machine was exhibited at the Jilin City Federation of Trade Unions' technical innovation exhibition. A material from the Vehicle Depot vividly described it at the Jilin Provincial Advanced Producers Conference: "The 'multi-head screw threading machine' created by Wang Engui and others has basically succeeded. Turner Liu Fengming skillfully operates it, and many people are happily gathering around to see this machine that can thread eight screws at once. Wang Engui touches his beloved machine. Engineers Jiang Zhenyu and Chang Jingchen are discussing beside the machine: Normally, a threading machine can only thread one screw at a time, who would have thought it could thread eight at once…."

This machine must have already played a huge role in production! No, the fact is not so. Please see the "internal situation":

Veteran worker Wang Engui of the Vehicle Depot proposed the suggestion of manufacturing a "multi-head screw threading machine." At the beginning of January this year, the depot accepted this suggestion and assigned two fitters to help with the trial production. Especially in March, in order to participate in the exhibition, the trial production work was even more intense. The mechanical room considered this as their main task, and three or four turners worked overtime to help. By the end of March, the "multi-head screw threading machine" was produced. The experimental result was that eight screws were turned at once, of which three were defective – that is to say, preliminary achievements had been made, but further improvements were needed before it could be applied to production.

The multi-head screw threading machine was placed in the exhibition hall, with eight high-quality screws installed on the die. The leading cadres of the Vehicle Depot were busy publicizing their achievements, but they forgot that they also had a responsibility to help Wang Engui improve the machine and realize this creation. In early June, the Da Shihtou Forestry Industry Bureau sent engineers and six other cadres to the Jilin Vehicle Depot to learn how to manufacture the machine. The leading cadres of the Vehicle Depot hemmed and hawed for a long time, and awkwardly said: "It hasn't succeeded yet, it's just for exhibition now." However, until September, the Jilin Railway Bureau Vehicle Department still sent this unsuccessful "multi-head screw threading machine" as a second exhibit, and wrote a material saying: "The multi-head screw threading machine has been successfully manufactured, solving the key problem of the supply of screw bolts falling short of demand, and ensuring the needs of passenger and freight car repair parts."

At the end of October, this "multi-head screw threading machine" returned. But until now, the work of continuing the experiment has not yet begun. People want to ask: Is this practice of the Jilin Railway Bureau Vehicle Department and the Jilin Vehicle Depot boasting about achievements, or truly supporting the creativity of the working masses?

### 运输部门应该节约制“飞子”用的布

    运输部门应该节约制“飞子”用的布
    读者徐舒林来信：目前某些运输部门办理运货时，用来识别货物的标签（俗称飞子）是用布印制的，有些单位所用飞子的布质很好。如果每张飞子需六方寸布，每一件货挂两个飞子，一万件货就要用一万二千方尺布。如果把全国各运输单位用在做飞子的布加起来，数量是很惊人的。这不但浪费了棉布，而且也增加了运输成本。建议各运输单位注意这一问题，考虑把运货时的布飞子改成纸制的。是吹嘘成绩，还是支持工人的创造编辑同志：
    九月间，在吉林铁路管理局先进工作者代表大会展览会车辆馆里，摆着一台“多头螺丝床子”。解说员不断向参观的人们说明：“这是吉林车辆段老工人王恩贵等人创造的，过去一台床子每回只能镟一根螺丝杆，现在一回能镟八根。”
    对于这台床子，吉林地区的铁路职工们已经相当熟悉了。从今年二月起，吉林车辆段的党总支和工会在总结、简报、专题报告里都不断提到它。以后，中共吉林铁路地区委员会、吉林铁路运输分局政治处组织科和中国铁路工会吉林分区委员会向上级机关报告时也谈到了这件事。从四月份到七月末，这台床子曾经在吉林市总工会举办的技术革新展览会上展出。吉林省召开先进生产者会议时，车辆段的一份材料里面生动地描述道：“王恩贵等人创造的‘多头螺丝床子’已经基本成功，镟工刘凤鸣熟练地操纵着它，许多人都欢欣地围拢来，看这台一次能套八个螺丝的床子。王恩贵手摸着心爱的机器。姜镇宇、常竞忱工程师在床子旁边谈论：从来套丝床一回只能套一个螺丝，想不到一回能套八个了……。”
    这台床子一定已经在生产中发挥了巨大的作用了吧！不，事实却不是这样。请看“内部情况”：
    车辆段老工人王恩贵提出了制造“多头螺丝床子”的建议。今年一月初，段上接受了这个建议，抽出两名钳工来帮助试制。特别是三月份，为了参加展览会，试制工作更加紧了。机械室把这当成主要工作，三、四名镟工加班加点帮助干。到三月末，“多头螺丝床子”制出来了。试验结果，一次镟出八个螺丝，其中有三个是废品——这就是说，初步成绩已经有了，但是还需要作进一步的改进，才能运用到生产中去。
    多头螺丝床子放在展览会的会场里，钣牙上安着八个头等质量的好螺丝。车辆段的领导干部忙着宣传自己的成绩，但是忘记了他们还有责任帮助王恩贵改进床子，实现这个创造。六月初，大石头森林工业局派了工程师等六个干部到吉林车辆段来学习制造床子的办法，车辆段领导干部支吾了半天，尴尬地说：“还没有成功哩，现在只是展览。”但是，直到九月份，吉林铁路管理局车辆处仍然把这台还没有成功的“多头螺丝床子”送去作第二次展品，并且写了一个材料说：“多头螺丝床子制造成功，解决了螺丝栓供不应求的关键问题，保证了客货车检修配件的需要。”
    十月末，这台“多头螺丝床子”回来了。但是直到现在，继续试验的工作还没有动手做。人们要问：吉林铁路管理局车辆处和吉林车辆段的这种做法，是吹嘘成绩呢，还是真正支持工人群众的创造？
