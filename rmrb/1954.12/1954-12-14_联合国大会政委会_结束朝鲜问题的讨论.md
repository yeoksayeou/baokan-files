Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its deliberations on the Korean question on the 8th.

    Soviet Representative Malik delivered a speech (abstract of the speech issued separately).

    Following him was the "Foreign Minister" of Syngman Rhee, Pyun Yung-tai, who attempted to defend Syngman Rhee's clamor for the resumption of the Korean War. He slandered India, India's foreign and domestic policies, and the Indian representative to the United Nations. Although the Chairman of the Committee, the representative of Colombia, Urrutia, interrupted this Syngman Rhee element, pointing out that such remarks were not allowed, the Chairman still allowed him to finish his shameless remarks.

    The Indian representative said that he did not intend to reply to "this gentleman brought here by the sixteen countries (participating in the intervention in the Korean War)."

    When the Committee proceeded to discuss the various proposals, the Soviet representative said that the Soviet delegation did not insist on a vote on its proposal to convene a meeting of all relevant countries to discuss the Korean issue in the near future, but supported the Indian proposal that had been amended by the Soviet Union. This amendment proposed deleting from the Indian proposal the recommendation to take note of the patently incorrect and non-objective report of the fifteen countries participating in the intervention in the Korean War on the Geneva Conference.

    The fifteen-nation proposal requesting approval of the fifteen-nation report was adopted by fifty votes. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against it. India, Burma, Saudi Arabia, and Syria abstained.

    After the fifteen-nation proposal was adopted, the Indian representative withdrew his proposal.

    The Committee rejected by a majority vote the proposal by the Soviet delegation to abolish the so-called "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea."

    联合国大会政委会
    结束朝鲜问题的讨论
    据新华社讯：联合国大会政治委员会八日结束了关于朝鲜问题的审议。
    苏联代表马立克发言（发言摘要另发）。
    接着发言的是李承晚“外务部长官”卞荣泰，他企图为李承晚发出的恢复朝鲜战争的叫嚣辩护。他对印度、印度的外交政策和内政政策以及印度驻联合国代表进行诽谤。虽然委员会主席、哥伦比亚代表乌鲁蒂亚曾经打断了这个李承晚分子的话，指出不允许说这种话，但是这个主席仍旧让他说完他的那些厚颜无耻的话。
    印度代表说，他不打算答复“（参加干涉朝鲜战争的）十六国带到我们这里来的这位先生”。
    当委员会进而讨论各项提案时，苏联代表说，苏联代表团不坚持要就它所提出的建议在最近将来召开一个由一切有关国家参加的讨论朝鲜问题的会议的提案进行表决，而支持已经由苏联提出修正案的印度提案。这个修正案提议从印度提案中删去建议注意那显然是不正确和不客观的参加干涉朝鲜战争的十五国关于日内瓦会议的片面报告。
    要求批准十五国报告的十五国提案以五十票获得通过。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克投票反对。印度、缅甸、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚弃权。
    在十五国提案被通过后，印度代表撤回了他的提案。
    委员会以多数票否决了苏联代表团所提出的撤销所谓“联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会”的提案。
