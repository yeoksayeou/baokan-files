 Shandong Province is training 200,000 district and township cadres and core members for establishing cooperatives this winter, plus cooperative accountants, totaling about 250,000 people. According to incomplete statistics from the end of November, nine special districts, including Dezhou, Jiaozhou, Tai'an, and Linyi, have already trained more than 48,900 people.

　　The cadres and core members who have been trained have further recognized the future of the socialist transformation of agriculture, and their enthusiasm for establishing cooperatives has generally increased. Wang Yunshan, an activist in establishing cooperatives in Difang Village, Seventh District, Pingyi County, actively promoted and connected with the masses under the leadership of the Party branch after returning to the village after training. After the training, the cadres and core members further clarified the principle of "voluntary mutual benefit," effectively correcting the blindly optimistic, greedy, and afraid-to-publicize the voluntary principle sentiments of some cadres and core members.

　　This year, the training work in various places also particularly emphasized the education of implementing the class line, criticizing the erroneous thinking of excluding poor peasants, discriminating against middle peasants, and losing vigilance against the sabotage activities of rich peasants.

    Many mutual aid teams in Sichuan Province are actively creating conditions to prepare for the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. In Nanchong Special District, 1,542 mutual aid teams have requested to establish cooperatives. After preliminary review, more than 82% of the mutual aid teams meet the conditions for establishing cooperatives. In Leshan Special District, most of the perennial mutual aid teams have carried out joint mutual aid; some joint mutual aid teams have also studied the management methods of agricultural production cooperatives, established joint committees to implement collective leadership, and promoted small contracting or individual piecework systems. In Wanxian Second District, 163 joint mutual aid teams bought 225 cattle and 948 farm tools, laying a material foundation for the establishment of cooperatives. Wang Zihe, the leader of the mutual aid team in Dongting Township, Zizhong County, often led the team members to visit the nearby Chang'an Agricultural Production Cooperative, educating everyone with the superiority of the old cooperative, and inspiring the enthusiasm of the team members to establish cooperatives; at the same time, he also trained seven core members for establishing cooperatives within the team. The members of the Li Yuanxiang joint mutual aid team in Shidao Township, Jiangjin County, under the slogan of "doing a good job in production and welcoming the establishment of cooperatives," 46 team members filled more than three dan of bare stone dams with soil and sowed wheat. During the autumn planting season, the whole team expanded the wheat planting area by 69% and the rapeseed planting area by nine times according to the national plan.

    山东省各地训练建立农业生产合作社干部
    四川省许多互助组积极创造条件准备建社
    山东省各地今冬将训练区、乡干部和办社骨干分子二十万人，再加上合作社会计人员，共约二十五万人左右。据十一月底的不完全统计，德州、胶州、泰安、临沂等九个专区已训练了四万八千九百余人。
    经过训练的干部及骨干分子，进一步认识了农业的社会主义改造的前途，办社情绪普遍高涨。平邑县七区地方村办社积极分子王运善，经过训练回村后在党支部的领导下，在群众中积极宣传和串连。经过训练，干部及骨干分子进一步明确了“自愿互利”的原则，有效地纠正了一部分干部、骨干分子的盲目乐观、贪多贪大的情绪和不敢宣传自愿原则的现象。
    今年各地在训练工作中，还特别强调了贯彻阶级路线的教育，批判了排斥贫农，歧视中农和对富农的破坏活动失去警惕性的错误思想。

    四川省许多互助组积极创造条件准备建立农业生产合作社。南充专区已有一千五百四十二个互助组提出了建社要求，经初步审查，百分之八十二以上的互助组符合建社条件。乐山专区的常年互助组大部进行了联组互助；部分互助联组还学习了农业生产合作社的经营管理办法，建立联组委员会实行集体领导，推行了小包工或个人计件制。万县二区一百六十三个互助联组，就买进耕牛二百二十五头，农具九百四十八件，给建社打下了物质基础。资中县洞庭乡王自和互助组，组长经常带领组员到附近长安农业生产合作社参观，以老社的优越性教育大家，启发组员们的建社热情；同时，还在组内培养了七个建社骨干。江津县石稻乡李远祥互助联组组员，在“搞好生产，迎接建社”的口号下，四十六个组员把三石多光石坝填上泥土播种了小麦，秋种中，全组按国家计划扩大小麦播种面积百分之六十九，油菜播种面积扩大九倍。
