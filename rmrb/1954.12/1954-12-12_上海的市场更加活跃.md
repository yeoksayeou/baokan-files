    Shanghai's seven specialized state-owned companies, including Department Store, Chemical Raw Materials, Transportation and Electrical Equipment, Medicine, Food, Native Produce, and Petroleum, have exceeded their November sales plans. The total sales of each company increased by 13.35% compared to October. The completion and expansion of sales by each company is due to the implementation of the principle of wholesale as the main focus, which facilitates the purchase of goods by public and private retail businesses. In November, the Department Store, Medicine, and Native Produce units successively established 19 wholesale outlets for small commodities, sugar, and medicinal materials. They also adjusted and lowered the wholesale starting points for 251 types of goods, including knitwear, cured meat, fruits, coal briquettes, and cigarettes and alcohol. For goods such as rubber shoes, yarn, timber, and porcelain, private merchants can purchase goods at any time due to improved wholesale procedures. In the past, the Shanghai branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company stipulated that distributors had to use coupons (cloth purchase coupons) to purchase goods. Due to the varying prices of cotton cloth, this often resulted in "having money but lacking coupons" or "having coupons but lacking money." After changing to a method of purchasing goods according to plan and periodically reclaiming cloth coupons based on actual sales volume, distributors found it much easier to purchase goods. In addition, increasing the supply of fast-selling goods and providing appropriate loans to retailers with funding difficulties further promoted the enthusiasm of private retailers to promote sales. In November, the amount of goods purchased by private retailers from state-owned companies increased by 11% compared to October. These measures have further activated Shanghai's market and expanded the supply to consumers. In November, the turnover of private retail stores increased to varying degrees compared to October.

    上海的市场更加活跃
    上海市国营百货、化工原料、交通电工器材、医药、食品、土产、石油等七个专业公司已超额完成十一月份销售计划。各公司销售总额比十月份增加百分之十三点三五。各公司完成和扩大了销售额是由于贯彻了以批发为主的方针，便利公、私营零售商业进货。十一月份内，百货、医药、土产等单位先后增设了小百货、食糖、药材等批发机构十九处，调整和降低了针棉织品、腌腊、水果、煤球、烟酒等批发起点二百五十一种。胶鞋、绒线、木材、瓷器等货物，由于批发手续改善，私商可以随时进货。中国花纱布公司上海市公司过去对经销户规定要凭券（购布券）进货，由于棉布价格的高低不一，往往形成“有款缺券”“有券缺款”。经改为按计划进货，布券按实际销量定期回笼的办法后，经销户进货已感到很大便利。此外，增加热销商品的供应，银行对资金困难的零售商给予适当的贷款，就更加推动了私营零售商推销的积极性。十
  一月份私营零售商向国营公司进货的金额已比十月份增加了百分之十一。这些办法已进一步活跃了上海市的市场，扩大了对消费者的供应。十一月份私营零售商店的营业额已比十月份有了不同程度的上升。　　　（本报上海记者站）
