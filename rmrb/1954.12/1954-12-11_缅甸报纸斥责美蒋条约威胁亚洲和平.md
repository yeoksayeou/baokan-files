    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 10th: The "New Times of Burma" published a commentary denouncing the US-Chiang treaty, saying that the treaty is a conspiracy by the United States to force Chiang Kai-shek upon the Chinese people. This treaty brings the fear of war to the people of Asia. It will be opposed by the people of Asia. The commentary stated that this unrealistic attitude of the United States has been rejected by public opinion in Asia and Europe. The Asian Colombo Conference countries and some major European countries have recognized the People's Republic of China. They not only believe that Chiang Kai-shek is utterly reactionary, but also believe that refusing to recognize China is not in line with the current situation.

    "Rangoon Daily" also published a commentary denouncing the US-Chiang treaty, saying that the United States puts the UN Charter in front, but does whatever it wants behind the scenes. The United States recently saw that some Southeast Asian countries have achieved considerable unity for peace, and intends to use Chiang Kai-shek to attack the People's Republic of China. The United States also intends to win over its puppet countries like the Korean War and disguise this war as a war of the United Nations. Obviously, the United States has disregarded what kind of organization the United Nations is. The commentary stated that if Asian countries cannot stop this situation from developing, a new war will break out in Asia.

    缅甸报纸斥责美蒋条约威胁亚洲和平
    【新华社十日讯】仰光消息：“缅甸新时代报”发表评论斥责美蒋条约说，美蒋条约是美国企图把蒋介石强压在中国人民头上的一个阴谋。这个条约给亚洲人民带来了战争的恐惧。它将遭到亚洲人民的反对。评论说，美国的这种违反现实的态度已经遭到了亚洲和欧洲舆论的唾弃。亚洲科伦坡会议国家和欧洲的一些主要国家都已经承认了中华人民共和国，它们不仅认为蒋介石是反动透顶的，而且认为拒绝承认中国是和当前的局势不符合的。
    “仰光日报”也发表评论斥责美蒋条约说，美国把联合国宪章摆在前面，而在背后为所欲为。美国最近看到东南亚一些国家为了和平而获得相当的团结，就打算利用蒋介石来进攻中华人民共和国。美国还企图像朝鲜战争一样拉拢它的仆从国家，把这个战争装成为联合国的战争。显然，美国已经不顾及联合国是个什么样的组织了。评论说，如果亚洲国家不能阻止这一形势的发展，在亚洲将掀起新的战争。
