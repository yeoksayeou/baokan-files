Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, December 3rd: Commanders and combatants of the People's Liberation Army land, sea, and air forces on the Zhejiang front unanimously angrily denounced the U.S. imperialists for signing the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to occupy our territory of Taiwan for a long time.

　　Huang Fengqi, a infantry company commander who participated in the entire Liberation War and was awarded a first-class merit in the battle to annihilate the entire U.S.-equipped Chiang bandit army rapid column in Lunan (southern Shandong), said: "This blatant act of aggression by U.S. imperialism cannot scare us. It can only further arouse our hatred for the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique! In the past, more than eight million Chiang bandit troops directly supported and armed by U.S. imperialism were annihilated by us. In the future, any conspiracy by the U.S. aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique will surely suffer a shameful and disastrous defeat."

　　Gao Siyuan, an anti-aircraft artillery soldier who bravely repelled U.S. military aircraft invading our airspace on November 8, said: "The more rampant the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism, the more we must retaliate with redoubled efforts!"

　　Some coastal defense artillery soldiers who severely damaged an American-made Chiang bandit "Yong" class minesweeper on November 5 said: If U.S. imperialism dares to obstruct our sacred struggle to liberate Taiwan, we will beat them until their heads are broken and bleeding, just like the Volunteer Army beat the American aggressors in Korea!

　　Cui Wei, a pilot of a certain People's Air Force fighter jet unit who shot down one U.S.-made Chiang aircraft, and Yin Zongmao, a pilot who shot down two U.S.-made Chiang aircraft and damaged one, heard the news of the signing of the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" between the U.S. and Chiang after returning from a patrol mission on the morning of the 3rd. They angrily said: This aggressive act of U.S. imperialism, which is determined to be the enemy of our 600 million people, has once again nakedly exposed its aggressive nature to the people of the world. No matter how crazy U.S. imperialism is, we must still resolutely liberate Taiwan! Wang Yufeng, a pilot of a certain unit who fiercely bombed Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island on November 1, said: "If Taiwan is not liberated for a day, our struggle will not end for a day!"

　　The People's Navy, which recently achieved brilliant victories in the battle against U.S.-made Chiang bandit warships, also unanimously angrily denounced the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism. Lin Fasong, deputy captain of a certain艇, said: "We must heighten our vigilance, redouble our efforts to improve tactics and technology, not only be ready to give a head-on blow to any enemy who dares to invade our territorial waters at any time, but also actively participate in the sacred struggle to liberate Taiwan and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique!"

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, December 4th: The various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front are actively strengthening their work in all aspects for the liberation of Taiwan, continuously improving military skills and work efficiency. Artillery units and anti-aircraft artillery units fighting on the coastal defense front are seizing every opportunity to persist in various training exercises. Soldiers of a certain artillery unit, who fiercely attacked Chiang bandit troops on Jinmen Island with a hit rate of 95%, extensively launched "mutual assistance and mutual learning" activities during intense training. Under the slogan of striving to become "all-round artillerymen," Sun Shaochen, a second artilleryman of a certain unit, learned the skills of the aimer and other artillerymen in a very short time. The aimer, Li Lianzhong, also quickly mastered the skills of the first artilleryman. Anti-aircraft artillery units have also generally improved their shooting skills while fighting and learning. In the air combat on November 1, a certain unit shot down and damaged eight Chiang bandit aircraft in only thirty-five minutes.

　　Commanders and fighters of the training units are diligently studying and practicing day and night, rapidly improving their training results. In a recent live ammunition shooting exercise of a certain unit, fifteen of the sixteen light machine gun shooters participating in the shooting were rated "excellent" and one was rated "good." They are also determined to continue to strengthen training and strive to achieve "excellent" ratings for all, in order to annihilate more Chiang bandit troops in battle. In a night shooting study session of the Third Squad of a certain unit, the soldiers proposed to train their eyes to be like night-shining pearls. In night live ammunition shooting, all members of the squad except one, who achieved a "good" score, achieved "excellent" scores.

　　Personnel of the various rear service units are using the slogan "What have you done for the liberation of Taiwan?" to urge themselves to strengthen their work in all aspects and actively support frontline operations. Motor vehicle units are constantly crossing mountains and ridges to ensure the timely and sufficient supply of military needs to the frontline troops. Lin Shaotang of a certain unit's ordnance repair shop doubled the efficiency of manufacturing weapon parts. The First Branch of a certain field hospital also implemented a new medical system to enhance treatment effectiveness.

    决不容许美国侵占台湾
    浙江前线部队怒斥美蒋“共同防御条约”
    福建前线部队为解放台湾提高战斗技术
    【新华社浙江前线三日电】浙江前线中国人民解放军陆、海、空军部队的指挥员、战斗员，一致愤怒斥责美帝国主义同蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓
  “共同防御条约”、企图长期侵占我国领土台湾的侵略行为。
    曾经参加过整个解放战争并在鲁南（山东南部）歼灭全部美械装备的蒋贼军快速纵队的战斗中荣立一等功的步兵连长黄丰歧说：“美帝国主义这种明目张胆的侵略行为是吓不住我们的，它只能更加激起我们对美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团的仇恨！过去，由美帝国主义直接支持和武装的八百多万蒋贼军都被我们歼灭了。今后，美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团的任何阴谋也必将遭到可耻的惨败。”
    在十一月八日曾经勇猛击退侵犯我国领空的美国军用飞机的高射炮兵高四元说：“美帝国主义的侵略行为越疯狂，我们越要给它以加倍回击！”
    在十一月五日曾重创一艘美制蒋贼永字号扫雷舰的某海防炮兵们说：美帝国主义如果敢于阻挠我们解放台湾的神圣斗争，我们就要像志愿军在朝鲜痛打美国侵略军一样地打得它头破血流！
    人民空军某歼击机部队的曾经击落美造蒋机一架的飞行员崔巍和击落美造蒋机二架、击伤一架的飞行员尹宗茂，在三日上午驾驶着战鹰执行巡逻任务回来后，听到了美蒋签订所谓“共同防御条约”的消息，他们愤怒地说：美帝国主义这种决心与我国六亿人民为敌的侵略行为，再一次向全世界人民赤裸裸地暴露了它的侵略本质。不论美帝国主义怎样疯狂，我们仍然要坚决解放台湾！曾在十一月一日猛烈轰炸了大陈岛上蒋贼军的某部飞行员王玉峰说：“台湾一天不解放，我们的斗争就一天不干休！”
    最近在打击美制蒋贼军舰的战斗中曾取得辉煌胜利的人民海军部队，也一致愤怒斥责美帝国主义的侵略行为。某艇副艇长林法松说：“我们要提高警惕，加倍努力提高战术、技术，不仅要随时准备给予敢来侵犯我国领海的任何敌人以迎头痛击，更要积极参加解放台湾的神圣斗争，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团！”
    【新华社福建前线四日电】中国人民解放军福建前线各部队积极为解放台湾加强各方面的工作，使军事技术和工作效率不断地得到提高。战斗在海防前线的炮兵部队和高射炮部队，都抓紧战斗空隙坚持进行了各项训练。曾以百分之九十五的命中率痛击金门岛上蒋贼军的某炮兵部队战士们，在紧张的训练中广泛展开了“互助互学”活动，在争取成为“全能炮手”的口号下，某部二炮手孙绍臣在很短的时间内就学会了瞄准手和其他炮手的技术。瞄准手李连忠也很快地掌握了一炮手的技术。高射炮部队在边打边学中也普遍提高了射击技术。某部在十一月一日的对空作战中，仅用三十五分钟的时间就击落、击伤蒋贼飞机八架。
    进行训练的部队指战员们在夜以继日地勤学苦练，迅速提高了训练成绩。某部在最近的一次实弹射击中，参加射击的十六名轻机枪射手中有十五名
  “优秀”，一名“良好”。他们还决心要继续加强训练，争取全部达到“优秀”，以便在战斗中歼灭更多的蒋贼军。某部三班在夜间射击学习中，战士们提出要把眼睛练得像夜明珠一样，他们在夜间实弹射击中，全班除一个人的成绩是“良好”外，其余全是“优秀”。
    各后方勤务部队的人员用“你为解放台湾做了些什么”的口号来督促自己从各方面加强工作，积极支援前线作战。汽车部队不停地越过崇山峻岭及时地保证了前线部队的充分的军需供应。某部修械厂林少棠把制造武器零件的工作效率提高了一倍。某野战医院一分院，还推行了新的医疗制度，加强了治疗效果。
