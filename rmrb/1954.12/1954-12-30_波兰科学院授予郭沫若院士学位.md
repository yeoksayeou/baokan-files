Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: The ceremony for the Polish Academy of Sciences to award the academician title to Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was held in Beijing on the 28th.

    Polish Ambassador to China, Kirilo, represented the Polish Academy of Sciences in awarding the academician certificate to Guo Moruo and delivered a speech. In his speech, Ambassador Kirilo pointed out the long cultural tradition of the Chinese people and the rich achievements of scientific inventions and discoveries accumulated throughout the ages. He also highlighted Guo Moruo's outstanding contributions to creative scientific thought. Kirilo said: The Chinese Academy of Sciences has traversed a glorious road in developing the theory and practice of various sciences. It combines its scientific research work with the policies of the country, so that its labor serves the prosperity and happiness of the motherland. Chinese scientists, together with all progressive scientists of the world, headed by the advanced Soviet scientists, are jointly fighting for the victory of the lofty ideas in the great Marxist-Leninist science. Kirilo concluded by pointing out that the achievements of Chinese scientific workers are also the achievements of Polish science, and wished further development for the peaceful Chinese science, the further consolidation and development of the fraternal friendship and cooperation between Chinese and Polish scientific workers, and that the lofty labor of advanced scientists around the world would contribute to the struggle for peace and a rational social system.

    Guo Moruo then delivered a reply, thanking the Polish Academy of Sciences for giving him this high honor. Guo Moruo said: The title of Academician conferred on me by the Polish Academy of Sciences is not only a great encouragement to me personally, but also a great encouragement to our Chinese scientific workers and the Chinese people, so that our Chinese scientific research work can develop and competently assume the responsibility of serving national construction. Guo Moruo said: Polish modern science has a more solid foundation and greater achievements than ours. We must strive to learn from Polish scientific workers and strengthen the creative cooperation between our Chinese and Polish scientific workers. Guo Moruo continued: Due to the absorption of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, Polish science has been further developed. In this regard, we must also learn from Polish scientific workers and strengthen the creative cooperation between Chinese and Soviet scientific workers.

    Attending today's ceremony were officials from the Polish Embassy in China, as well as Zhang Jiafu, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qian Sanqiang, Secretary-General, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Ding Xilin, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, Chen Zhongjing, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Foreign Cultural Relations, Wang Tuo, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and well-known figures from the scientific, cultural, and educational circles of the capital.
