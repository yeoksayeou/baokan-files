The state has allocated 1,005 billion yuan to the flood-stricken areas of Hubei Province to help disaster victims quickly restore production and resolve their living difficulties. This allocation includes relief funds, compensation for flood diversion areas, and production loans from the People's Bank. Currently, 530 billion yuan has been distributed to the disaster victims, with the remaining 520 billion yuan in the process of being distributed. State-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives in the disaster areas have also prepared a large quantity of daily necessities, means of production, and materials for repairing and building houses for the disaster victims.

Such enormous support from the state for the people in the disaster areas of Hubei Province has greatly inspired the disaster victims' confidence in overcoming the disaster and striving for a bumper harvest next year. After receiving over 200 billion yuan in aid from the state, the disaster victims in the severely affected counties along the Yangtze River and lakes, such as Mianyang, Hanchuan, Hanyang, and Jianli, are, under the leadership of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, actively repairing and building houses, repairing ploughs and rakes, buying seeds and accumulating fertilizer, and carrying out winter planting on the land that has receded from the floodwaters. Most of the land that has receded from the floodwaters has been planted with barley, wheat, rape, and other crops. More than 60 percent of the houses destroyed by the floods have also been rebuilt. After receiving 46.6 billion yuan in compensation for flood diversion, housing subsidies, and food relief from the state, the people in the Liangzi Lake flood diversion area of Echeng County have bought back more than 47,000 jin of seeds and more than 3,000 dan of fertilizer. At the same time, they have repaired or newly built more than 1,000 fishing boats and 20,000 fishing nets. Sixteen peasant households at the Leishan Mountain foot flood diversion outlet have newly built a row of tidy houses. After receiving large amounts of aid from the state, the peasants in Renhe Township, Hanchuan County, under the leadership of three agricultural production cooperatives and fifty-four mutual aid teams, have formulated a plan to increase grain production by 130,000 jin next spring. They have used state subsidies and production loans to repair nearly 100 large and small farm tools, bought back more than 31,000 jin of seeds, and one draught cattle. In seven days, they carried out winter planting on 5,700 mu of land that had receded from the floodwaters, and repaired 340 houses. (Xinhua News Agency)
