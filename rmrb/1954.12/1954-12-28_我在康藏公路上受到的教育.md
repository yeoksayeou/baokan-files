    The Education I Received on the Kangzang Highway
    Road Chao, Special Model Worker of the Second Construction Bureau Automotive Brigade
    The full opening of the Kangzang Highway is a major victory for the nation's border construction. Its completion was not easy. For more than four years, workers and soldiers, under the leadership of the Party, united to overcome difficulties such as glaciers, quicksand, and landslides, and built a highway more than two thousand kilometers long. In the course of this four-year road construction, our transportation troops delivered all materials to the construction site on time. What have I done for the motherland and the Tibetan people in these four years?
    I entered Kangzang in June 1950. By the beginning of this year, I had safely driven more than 125,000 kilometers on the Kangzang Highway. This little achievement was made under the education of the Party. I recall that when I was in the Second Company of a certain regiment, instructor Liu Deming told me the story of a brave driver who rescued more than a dozen vehicles and preserved the people's property under enemy fire. I was very moved. In February 1951, our vehicles were transporting goods on Erlang Mountain. The mountain was covered with snow, and the road surface was icy. I suggested that each vehicle in the company carry two bags of sand to spread on the frozen parts of the road. We drove back and forth without any accidents.
    I remember once driving a car to take labor models to Xinjin, Sichuan, to attend a labor model conference. I was very touched to see them being respected everywhere, and I resolved to learn from them and do my job well.
    After I was transferred to the Automotive Brigade of the Second Construction Bureau of the Southwest Highway Engineering Bureau, Brigade Commander Zhang Chao often instructed us to maintain the fine traditions and work style of the People's Liberation Army in the long term. I always kept the brigade commander's words in mind. When the projects on both sides of the Nujiang River were nearing completion, one night, close to 11 o'clock, I was given an urgent task by my superiors. They asked me to drive from the edge of the Nujiang River to Wengda, and then transport steel frames from Wengda to the Nujiang bridgehead. This load of steel frames had to be delivered by dawn because the Nujiang River was to be opened to traffic the next day, and this load of steel frames was crucial for the opening. I accepted the task. When I drove to Wengda, it was almost 2 o'clock. I quickly woke up the loading and unloading workers and, together with them, loaded the bridge materials onto the vehicle. When I drove back to the east bank of the Nujiang River, it was almost dawn. I completed the task on time. The next day, the Nujiang bridge was erected, and I felt an indescribable joy in my heart.
    For more than four years, I have been driving cars on the Kangzang Highway. Whenever I encounter difficulties, I often think of the words of Instructor Liu Deming and Brigade Commander Zhang Chao, and I think of the Party's education for me. This has increased my confidence and courage, and it has made me always pay attention to protecting vehicles, saving fuel and tires, and always paying attention to safe driving. I am grateful to the Party for my education. In the future, I will be more modest and cautious, and I will work hard for the long-term construction of Kangzang.

    我在康藏公路上受到的教育
    第二施工局汽车大队特等模范　路超
    康藏公路的全线通车，是祖国在边疆建设上的一大胜利。它的修成是不简单的，四年多来，工人和战士，在党的领导下，团结在一起，克服了冰川、流砂、坍方等困难，筑成一条长达二千多公里的公路。在这四年多的筑路过程中，我们运输部队，按时把一切物资运到工地。四年多来，我给祖国、给藏族人民做了一些什么呢？
    我是一九五零年六月进入康藏的，到今年年初，我在康藏公路安全行驶了十二万五千多车公里，这一点点成绩，是在党的教育下取得的。回想我在某团二连的时候，指导员刘德明对我说过一位勇敢的驾驶员的故事，他在敌人炮火下，抢救了十多辆汽车，保全了人民的财产。我听了很受感动。一九五一年二月，我们的车在二郎山担任运输，山上积雪、路面结冰，我建议全连每辆车带沙子两麻袋，铺在路面冻冰的地方，来回的行驶，没发生过事故。
    记得有一次，我驾驶的车，送劳动模范到四川新津开劳动模范大会，我看到他们到处受到尊重，很受感动，决心向他们学习，做好自己的工作。
    我调到西南公路工程局第二施工局汽车大队后，大队长张超经常指示我们，叫我们长远的保持在解放军队伍里的优良传统和工作作风，大队长的话，我经常记在心里，怒江两岸的工程快竣工时，一个晚上，快十一点钟了，上级交给我一个紧急任务，叫我驾驶车从怒江边出发到翁达，再从翁达运钢架到怒江桥头，这一车钢架一定要在天明时运到，因为第二天怒江要通车，这一车钢架是决定通车的关键。我接受了任务，开车到翁达时，快两点多钟了，我赶快把装卸工人叫醒来，和他们一道将桥料装上车后，赶回怒江东岸时，天快亮了，按时完成了任务，第二天，怒江桥架好了，我心中有说不出的快乐。
    四年多来，我在康藏公路驾驶汽车，每碰到困难，经常想起指导员刘德明和大队长张超的话，想起党对我的教育，使我增加了信心和勇气，使我时刻的注意爱护车辆，节省油料和轮胎，时刻注意安全行驶。我感谢党对我的教育，今后更要虚心谨慎，为长期建设康藏而努力。
