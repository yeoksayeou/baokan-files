    Shanghai Actively Trains Hardware Technicians
    Continues to Mobilize Hardware Workers to Participate in National Key Construction
    The several mechanical manufacturing technical training classes set up by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau have been expanded and reorganized this year in order to train the increasingly needed hardware technicians for national key construction projects. Up to now, these training classes have possessed more than 700 lathes, 80 planers, 140 drilling machines, 17 milling machines, 4 rolling machines, 2 cupolas, and other equipment, as well as more than 1,000 administrative and technical personnel. Each session can accommodate more than 3,000 students, and the training period is one and a half years. The more than 3,400 students participating in the most recent training class are mostly unemployed workers, clerks, and young students around the age of 20 with an education level of junior high school or above. While learning technical operations and technical theory, the students also receive regular physical exercise and political and cultural education.
    In the past, the labor employment training work of the Shanghai Municipal Labor Bureau was relatively extensive. In addition to mechanical manufacturing technical training classes, it also held various short-term training classes in surveying, accounting, banking, and health, and used the method of entrusting factories to train apprentices on their behalf, so that unemployed people could learn skills before being employed. From 1950 to the end of October this year, more than 29,000 unemployed workers, clerks, and intellectuals have learned techniques in training classes and been introduced to various construction positions. The living and learning expenses of unemployed people receiving training in technical training classes are paid from government-allocated funds and unemployment relief funds paid by public and private enterprises and employed workers. It is still the same now. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Shanghai's hardware workers continue to sign up to participate in national key construction. The third batch of mobilization plan for more than 2,000 people this year has been announced, and many workers from private factories and some local state-owned and joint state-private factories have begun to sign up.
    The target of this mobilization is still employed workers with technical grades of level four or above, such as lathe operators, fitters, milling machine operators, and grinding machine operators. After being reviewed and admitted, these people will go to important construction sites such as the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Ball Bearing Plant, the Oil Refinery, and the Tractor Manufacturing Plant. Among them, about 1,400 people are about to depart, and the rest will be first assigned to several major state-owned factories in East China for training and cultivation, and then dispatched in a timely manner when new construction projects need them.
    In the second half of this year, Shanghai has already mobilized and transported two batches of more than 3,100 hardware workers of level four or above to participate in national key construction. They have all arrived at key construction posts in Anshan, Changchun, Shenyang, Taiyuan, Daye and other places. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Labor Administrative Department and many factories and workers' families have received many letters from these two batches of workers, in which they happily reported their work situation and labor achievements in their new positions. In their new work positions, many workers have been promoted to team leaders and group leaders because of their dedication to technology, unity with the masses, and adherence to labor discipline.

    上海市积极培养五金技术工人
    继续动员五金工人参加国家重点建设
    上海市人民政府劳动局设的几个机械制造技术训练班今年已扩充改组，以便为国家重点建设工程培养需要愈来愈多的五金技术工人。到目前为止，这几个训练班已拥有七百多台车床、八十台刨床、一百四十台钻床、十七台铣床、四台滚床、两只冲天炉等设备，并有一千多个行政人员和技术人员，每期可以容纳三千名以上的学员，训练期限是一年半。参加最近一期训练班的三千四百多个学员，大多数是年龄在二十岁左右、具有高小以上程度的失业工人、店员和青年学生。在学习技术操作和技术理论的同时，学员们还受到正规的体育锻炼和政治文化等教育。
    过去，上海市劳动局的劳动就业训练工作比较广泛，除了机械制造技术训练班外，还举办了测量、会计、银行、卫生等各种短期的训练班，并用委托各厂代训艺徒的方法，使失业人员在就业前学会技能。从一九五零年开始到今年十月底止，先后有两万九千多失业的工人、店员和知识分子在训练班中学会了技术被介绍到各种建设岗位上去。在技术训练班中受训的失业人员的生活和学习费用，由政府拨付的基金和公私企业、在业职工缴纳的失业工人救济基金中支付。现在还是一样。（新华社）
    上海市五金工人继续报名参加国家重点建设。今年第三批二千多人的动员计划已经宣布，许多私营工厂和一部分地方国营、公私合营工厂的工人都已开始报名。
    这次动员的对象仍是技术等级在四级以上的车工、钳工、铣工、磨工等在业工人。这些人经审查录取后，将分别前往第一汽车制造厂、滚珠轴承厂、炼油厂和拖拉机制造厂等重要的建设工地去。其中约有一千四百人就要出发，其余将先分配到华东地区几个主要的国营工厂中训练、培养，在新建工程需要时再及时派去。
    今年下半年，上海已经动员、输送了两批共三千一百多个四级以上的五金工人参加国家重点建设。他们都已到达鞍山、长春、沈阳、太原、大冶等地的重点建设岗位。最近，上海市劳动行政部门和许多工厂、工人家属收到了这两批工人写回来的许多信件，他们愉快地报告了自己在新岗位上的工作情况和劳动成就。在新的工作岗位上，不少工人因为钻研技术、团结群众、遵守劳动纪律，已被提升为工段长和小组长。（新华社）
