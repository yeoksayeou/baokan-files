The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China and the Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China jointly issued "Instructions on Studying and Implementing the Organic Law of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China" on the 7th.

The instructions stated: Earnest implementation of the Organic Law of the People's Courts will greatly promote the further democratization and regularization of our country's judicial work, and strengthen and consolidate our country's revolutionary legal system, so as to guarantee the country's socialist construction. The primary key to implementing the Organic Law of the People's Courts lies in all judicial cadres having a correct understanding of the Organic Law of the People's Courts, seeking consistent understanding, consistent interpretation, and consistent action. Therefore, leading and organizing the nationwide judicial cadres to earnestly study the Organic Law of the People's Courts has become a major political task for people's courts and judicial administrative organs at all levels.

The instructions require judicial cadres at all levels to achieve a consistent and correct understanding of the following six issues when studying the Organic Law of the People's Courts:

	(1)	Strengthening and consolidating the important significance of the revolutionary legal system in our country's socialist construction, as well as the significance of the unified exercise of national adjudicative power by the courts, equality for all citizens in the application of the law, and the independence of the people's courts in conducting trials and only obeying the law, and other principles of legal unity.

	(2)	The tasks of the people's courts: Implementing dictatorship and protecting democracy are two unified and inseparable aspects of the fundamental tasks of the people's courts; judicial work must serve the country's political tasks, and the general task of judicial work during the transition period is to "guarantee the smooth progress of the country's socialist construction and socialist transformation"; the people's courts are not purely punitive organs, and also have the task of educating the people. The people's courts should use their unique function—"through judicial activities"—to serve socialist construction and the central work of the country in various periods.

	(3)	The significance and role of various systems for further democratizing court work. Open trials, defense, jury, conducting litigation in the language and script of the national minority, election of court presidents, and the court's responsibility to the people's congress at the same level are all systems to ensure accurately striking at the enemy and reasonably handling the disputes of the masses, in order to avoid wronging a good person and letting go of a bad person. Earnest implementation of these systems is first and foremost beneficial to the people, and also beneficial to the development and improvement of judicial work. It must be clear that strengthening the mass viewpoint of cadres and establishing democratic thinking are the driving forces for implementing the above systems.

	(4)	Establishing and strengthening the collective leadership within the people's courts, further giving play to the role of the collegial panel and the judicial committee, and strengthening the responsibility of the president and division chiefs in the collective leadership.

	(5)	The correct relationship between the people's courts and the people's congress, people's committee, procuratorate, public security, judicial administration, and other relevant departments at the same level, the relationship between the courts at higher and lower levels, and how the higher-level courts implement and strengthen the judicial supervision of the lower-level courts.

	(6)	Court settings and levels of trial: The benefits of establishing people's tribunals in basic-level people's courts, adding intermediate people's courts, and implementing a two-instance final judgment system.

The instructions stated: In the process of learning, the issue of understanding should be resolved first; at the same time, the spirit of criticism and self-criticism must be carried forward, and in particular, ideological viewpoints and work styles incompatible with the Organic Law of the People's Courts should be examined and criticized from top to bottom; while learning, all localities must also combine the study of the Organic Law of the People's Procuratorates of the People's Republic of China.

The instructions concluded: The purpose of studying the Organic Law of the People's Courts is to correctly implement it. After understanding the essence of the Organic Law of the People's Courts, each unit must, in accordance with the principle of "from top to bottom, leading by example at each level, combining key points and overall coverage, and actively promoting," study and formulate a plan for how to comprehensively implement it in this region. Those with conditions should implement it immediately, and those with insufficient conditions should actively create conditions. (Xinhua News Agency)

    最高人民法院和司法部联合发布指示
    号召所属组织学习和贯彻人民法院组织法
    中华人民共和国最高人民法院和中华人民共和国司法部七日联合发布“关于学习与贯彻中华人民共和国人民法院组织法的指示”。
    指示说：认真贯彻人民法院组织法，将大大促进我国司法工作进一步的民主化和正规化，加强与巩固我国的革命法制，以保障国家的社会主义建设。贯彻人民法院组织法的首要关键，在于全体司法干部对人民法院组织法有正确的理解，求得认识一致，解释一致和行动一致。因此，有领导、有组织地动员与组织全国司法干部认真学习人民法院组织法，便成为各级人民法院和司法行政机关当前的一项重大的政治任务。
    指示要求各级司法干部在学习人民法院组织法时必须着重对下列六个问题取得一致的正确认识：
      （一）加强与巩固革命法制在我国进行社会主义建设中的重要意义，以及国家审判权统一由法院行使，对任何公民在适用法律上一律平等，人民法院独立进行审判只服从法律等法制统一原则的意义。
    （二）人民法院的任务：实行专政与保护民主是人民法院根本任务中统一的不可分割的两个方面；司法工作必须为国家政治任务服务，司法工作在过渡时期的总任务是“保障国家的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行”；人民法院不单纯是惩罚机关，并负有教育人民的任务。人民法院应该运用自己的特有职能——“通过审判活动”来为社会主义建设服务，为国家各个时期的中心工作服务。
    （三）法院工作进一步民主化的各项制度的意义与作用。审判公开、辩护、陪审、用本民族语言文字进行诉讼、法院院长选举及法院对本级人民代表大会负责等制度，是为了保证准确地打击敌人，合理地处理群众的纠纷，以期不冤枉一个好人，不放纵一个坏人。认真贯彻这些制度，首先是有利于人民，同时也有利于司法工作的开展与提高。必须明确：加强干部的群众观点，树立民主思想，是实行上述各项制度的动力。
    （四）建立与加强人民法院内部的集体领导，进一步发挥合议制和审判委员会的作用，加强院长、庭长在集体领导中的责任。
    （五）人民法院与同级人民代表大会、人民委员会、检察、公安、司法行政等有关部门间、法院上下级间的正确关系，以及上级法院如何实行与加强对下级法院的审判监督。
    （六）法院设置和审级问题：基层人民法院设置人民法庭，增设中级人民法院和实行两审终审制的好处。
    指示说：在学习过程中，应首先集中解决认识问题；同时，必须发扬批评与自我批评的精神，特别应由上而下地检查、批判与人民法院组织法不相容的思想观点和工作作风；各地在学习的同时，还必须结合学习中华人民共和国人民检察院组织法。
    指示最后说：学习人民法院组织法的目的在于正确地贯彻执行。各单位在领会人民法院组织法的精神实质后，更必须根据“由上而下、层层带头，点面结合，积极推行”的方针，研究并制定本地区如何全面贯彻执行计划。各地有条件的应立即执行，条件不够的应积极创造条件。　（新华社）
