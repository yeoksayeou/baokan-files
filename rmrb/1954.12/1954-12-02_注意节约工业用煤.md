Some provinces and cities in East China and Northeast China have achieved good results in conserving coal. Shanghai established an organization in June of this year to lead coal conservation efforts, systematically and strategically carrying out this work. Cadres were dispatched to factories to investigate coal burning practices, study and promote methods and experiences for conserving coal. They also went into factories to provide specific assistance with trial burning, achieving significant results. For example, the Xinhua Rubber Factory saved 15.14% compared to before the trial burning, the Hengfeng Textile Factory saved 22.7%, the Changcheng Glass Factory saved 36%, the Xiangchang Dyeing Factory saved 19%, and the Guangzhong Paper Mill saved 14.8%, averaging a saving of 21%. According to statistics, in September this year, 278 factories in Shanghai consuming more than 100 tons of coal each saved an average of 9.25% (compared to the same period in 1953). The coal construction companies in Anshan and Benxi cities, Liaoning Province, under the leadership of the local Municipal Finance Committee, also conducted key investigations in August and September this year, finding serious waste in coal usage for cooking and heating in many government organizations. They immediately consulted with relevant units, requesting them to appropriately revise their plans to save coal. The Shenyang Coal Construction Company is preparing to convene a meeting to promote coal conservation work. With the help of the Benxi Coal Construction Company, more than 200 government units in Benxi City improved their furnace burning methods and used blowers in July and August this year, saving 20% of coal, with some saving as much as 40%. In the past, pulverized coal and inferior coal were overstocked, while lump coal was in short supply. Since various regions have vigorously carried out coal conservation work, lump coal can be greatly saved for use in industrial and mining areas.

This year, the Changchun Railway Locomotive Depot promoted the coal-saving operating method of driver Li Shaoqiang and the rapid fire-starting method of Sun Shigui, saving more than 2,400 tons of coal in ten months. Bai Wenbin, driver of locomotive No. 729, is the best at learning from Li Shaoqiang's advanced coal-saving experience. He flexibly applied Li Shaoqiang's experience. He wrote the coal consumption quota prescribed by the higher authorities on the blackboard, so that he could see it often while driving, reminding himself to save coal. Even in January and February, which are particularly coal-intensive months, he saved a lot of coal. The locomotive groups of Nos. 607 and 609 study coal-saving methods before each shift, so they were still able to save coal in the windy month of May. The No. 609 locomotive group saved 21 tons of coal in May. The No. 152 locomotive, a shunting locomotive, has always been very coal-intensive, but in the past two months, they mixed coal dust from the smoke chamber into the coal for burning, saving three tons of coal in September. Currently, the workers at the locomotive depot are striving to save 120 tons of coal in November.

    注意节约工业用煤
    华东、东北地区某些省市，在节约用煤方面获得良好成绩。上海市在今年六月份成立了领导节约用煤的组织，有计划地有重点地开展节约用煤的工作。并派干部分头深入工厂，调查烧煤情况，研究并推广节约用煤的办法和经验。同时深入工厂具体帮助试烧，获得很显著的效果。如新华橡胶厂比试烧前节约百分之十五点一四，恒丰纺织厂节约百分之二十二点七，昌成玻璃厂节约百分之三十六，祥昌印染厂节约百分之十九，光中造纸厂节约百分之十四点八。平均节约百分之二十一。据统计，今年九月份一个月，上海市消耗一百吨煤以上的二百七十八个工厂可以节约百分之九点二五（与一九五三年同期比较）。辽宁省鞍山、本溪等市煤建公司，在当地市财委领导下，今年八、九月份也有重点地进行了调查，发现很多机关在炊事、取暖用煤方面有严重浪费现象。当即和有关单位协商，要求他们适当地修订计划，节约煤炭。沈阳市煤建公司正在筹备召开会议，开展节约用煤工作。本溪市二百多个机关单位，今年七、八月份在本溪市煤建公司帮助下改进烧炉子方法，改用吹风机，节省煤炭百分之二十，最多的可以节省百分之四十。过去末煤和劣质煤积压，块煤供不应求，自从各地大力开展节约用煤工作后，可以大大节省块煤供工、矿区使用。
    长春铁路机务段今年推广司机李绍强省煤操作法和孙士贵快速焚火法，十个月来节省了二千四百多吨煤。学习李绍强先进省煤经验最好的是七二九号机车司机白文彬。他灵活运用了李绍强的经验。他把上级规定的用煤数量写在黑板上，使自己开车时常常看到，提醒自己省煤。今年一、二月是特别费煤的月份，他也省了不少煤。六○七号和六○九号机车小组，每次在接班以前先研究省煤方法，所以他们在多风的五月仍然能够省煤。六○九号机车小组在五月份中节省了二十一吨煤。一五二号机车是小运转车一向很费煤，但在近两个月他们把烟室内的煤烟子混在煤里烧，九月份就省了三吨煤。目前机务段的工人，正为在十一月份节省一百二十吨煤而努力。
