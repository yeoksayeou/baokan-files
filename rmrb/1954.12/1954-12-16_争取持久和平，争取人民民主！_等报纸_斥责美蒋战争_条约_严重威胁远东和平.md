Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 15th: The latest issue of "Struggle for Lasting Peace, for People's Democracy!" published an article entitled "The War Deal Between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek - A Serious Threat to Peace." The article stated that the Chinese people's just desire to liberate Taiwan has received the deep sympathy of people all over the world. People all over the world believe that this is the correct path to prevent war and guarantee peace in the Far East.

The article pointed out that the US-Chiang treaty incites the Kuomintang bandit gang to launch new aggression against the People's Republic of China. Peace-loving people believe that this treaty is a serious threat to peace. The article pointed out that the US ruling clique clamors that this treaty is "defensive" which is only to cover up its aggressive nature. They attempt to make the US occupation of Taiwan continue forever in a "legal form." This treaty flagrantly interferes in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.

The article said that when 600 million Chinese people have completely stood up and become incredibly powerful, the drafters of this treaty actually signed it, they must have completely lost their sense of reality. The article concluded that no provocative actions can shake the Chinese people's unyielding will to defend their sovereignty and territory and defend peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 15th: The Czechoslovakian "People's Defense Line" newspaper commented on the 14th on Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," saying that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement demonstrates the unshakable determination of the 600 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, resist aggression, and defend peace. The signatories of the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" should seriously heed this statement. The commentary said that this treaty is not only for further aggressive actions against the Chinese people, but also a part of the American aggressive policy of undermining the peace and freedom of the peoples of Europe and Asia.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”等报纸
    斥责美蒋战争“条约”严重威胁远东和平
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】最近一期“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”刊载了一篇文章，题目是“美国和蒋介石的战争交易——对和平的严重威胁”。文章写道，中国人民解放台湾的正当愿望得到全世界人民深切的同情。全世界人民认为，这是防止战争和保证远东和平的正确道路。
    文章指出，美蒋条约煽动国民党匪帮向中华人民共和国进行新的侵略。爱好和平的人民认为，这个条约是对和平的严重威胁。文章指出，美国统治集团叫嚷说，这个条约是“防御性的”，这种说法只是为了掩盖它的侵略性质而已。他们企图以“合法的形式”使美国对台湾的占领永远继续下去。这个条约悍然干涉了中华人民共和国的内政。
    文章说，当六亿中国人民完全站起来并且变得无比强大的时候，这个条约的拟订者竟然签订这个条约，他们一定完全丧失现实感了。文章最后说，任何挑衅行动都动摇不了中国人民保卫他们主权和领土和保卫和平的不屈不挠的意志。
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】捷克斯洛伐克“人民防线报”十四日评论周恩来外交部长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明说，周恩来外交部长的声明显示了六亿中国人民解放台湾和抵抗侵略保卫和平的不可动摇的决心。美蒋“共同防御条约”的签订者应当严重注意这个声明。评论说，这个条约不仅是为了对中国人民进一步进行侵略行动，而且是美国破坏欧洲和亚洲各国人民的和平和自由的侵略政策的一部分。
