Guangdong Farmers Enthusiastically Sell Surplus Grain

The late rice harvest in Guangdong Province has been completed. The autumn grain requisition and purchase work throughout the province has been fully launched, and the vast number of farmers are enthusiastically selling their surplus grain to the state. From October 1st to November 24th, various regions throughout the province have already purchased more than 340 million jin of grain.

Around mid-November, expanded meetings of county, district, and township cadres were held successively throughout the province to arrange the grain requisition and purchase work. These meetings, through organizing recollection and comparison, conducted education on supporting national industrialization, supporting people in disaster areas, and supporting the liberation of Taiwan. The political awareness of the vast number of cadres has been further enhanced, and they have expressed their determination to resolutely complete the grain requisition and purchase tasks. For example, after the head of Xinlong Township in Qingyuan County recalled the situation in which his father was persecuted to death by the Kuomintang reactionaries, he said: "I must complete the grain purchase task to support the liberation of Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang bandits!" District and township cadres in Qiongdong, Lehui, Wenchang and other counties in the Hainan district all expressed that they would educate and mobilize the masses well and strive to over fulfill the grain purchase tasks. After cadres went to the countryside to carry out publicity and education, the vast number of farmers were very enthusiastic about selling grain. After the autumn harvest, the Meidang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lingao County has already sold more than 7,900 jin of grain, exceeding their original grain sales plan by 14 percent.

    广东省农民踊跃卖余粮
    广东省晚稻已经收割完毕，全省的秋季征粮购粮工作已经全面展开，广大农民正踊跃地把余粮卖给国家。从十月一日到十一月二十四日，全省各地已经收购粮食三亿四千多万斤。
    十一月中旬前后，全省各地先后召开了县区乡三级干部扩大会议，布置征粮购粮工作。这些会议通过组织回忆对比等办法，进行了支援国家工业化、支援灾区人民和支援解放台湾的教育。广大干部政治觉悟进一步提高，纷纷表示要坚决完成征粮购粮任务。如清远县新隆乡乡长回忆了父亲被国民党反动派迫害死去的情形以后说：“我一定要完成购粮任务，来支援解放台湾，消灭蒋贼军！”海南区琼东、乐会、文昌等县的区乡干部都表示要很好地教育和动员群众，争取超额完成购粮任务。各地干部下乡展开宣传教育以后，广大农民卖粮十分踊跃。临高县美当村农业生产合作社秋收以后已经卖粮七千九百多斤，超过他们原来的卖粮计划百分之十四。　（本报广东记者站）
