Farmland Water Conservancy Winter Repair Projects Commence Across the Country

Rural areas in various provinces are extensively carrying out winter farmland water conservancy projects. According to incomplete statistics from Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Henan, Gansu and other provinces, the projects planned by farmers for this winter and next spring, including digging canals, drilling wells, constructing mountain bend ponds and small reservoirs, will benefit nearly 25 million mu of farmland.

Currently, the southern provinces have entered the stage of full-scale construction. Farmers in Dingyuan, Jiashan, Lai'an, Quanjiao, and Feidong counties in Anhui Province have completed more than 300,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work for the construction of more than 1,700 ponds and dams. Farmers in Sichuan Province are experimenting with the construction of large mountain bend ponds, and the People's Government has sent more than 700 water conservancy cadres to assist in planning and guiding construction. According to statistics from early October, 72 mountain bend ponds have been completed, and 146 are about to be completed; it is still being vigorously promoted. Guangdong Province plans to build 18,000 projects this winter and next spring, including more than 600 key projects under the control of the county People's Government, which have already started this month. By the end of October, some of the more than 200 projects designed in Zhejiang Province have also started. Jinhua County has also established county, district, and township-level command posts to lead farmers in construction.

The climate in the northern provinces is cold, and farmers in many provinces and regions are still carrying out winter farmland water conservancy projects. Farmers in Chifeng County, Rehe Province, have recently repaired more than 70 water channels that were washed away by mountain floods, and more than 20 channels have begun to release water to freeze the ground. Six of the 59 channels to be built this winter in Linxia Special District, Gansu Province, have been completed. Shidong and Shuichuan districts in Gaolan County have dug more than 31,600 zhang of contour trenches. According to statistics from Gaolan, Huining, Yongjing, Linxia, Yuzhong and other counties, the irrigated area can be expanded by more than 40,700 mu before the ground freezes this year. In addition to completing more than 100 projects that were not completed in the fall, Shandong Province will also restore projects that were destroyed during the flood season this winter, and strengthen the repair of existing wells, canals, and water lifting tools and other water conservancy facilities in order to complete the winter watering of 3 million mu of wheat.

Now, Yunnan Province has combined the repair of ponds and dams with timely storage of rainwater. In October, the water storage in ponds and dams in Chuxiong, Yuxi, Mengzi and other special districts has reached more than 80%. Xiangyun, Jianshui, Quxi, Kaiyuan and other counties have stored up to 90%. Henan Province will expand irrigation by 200,000 mu this winter.

    各地农田水利冬修工程开工
    各省农村正广泛进行冬修农田水利的工程。据安徽、江西、四川、浙江、广东、河南、甘肃等省不完全统计，今冬明春农民计划的开渠、打井、兴修山弯大塘和小型水库等项工程，受益农田将达到近二千五百万亩。
    目前，南方各省已进入全面施工阶段。安徽省定远、嘉山、来安、全椒、肥东五县农民修筑的一千七百多处塘坝，已完成土石方三十万公方以上。四川省农民作兴修山弯大塘的试验，人民政府派出七百多名水利干部帮助规划和指导施工。据十月上旬统计，已修成山弯大塘七十二个，即将完成的有一百四十六个；目前仍在大力推广中。广东省计划在今冬明春兴修的一万八千处工程，其中由县人民政府掌握的六百多处重点工程，已在本月内开工。到十月底止，浙江省完成设计的二百多处工程，部分也已开工。金华县并成立了县、区、乡三级指挥部，领导农民施工。
    北方各省气候寒冷，不少省区农民仍在冬修农田水利。热河省赤峰县农民日前已修好七十多条被山洪冲毁的水渠，有二十多条渠道并已开始放水冻地。甘肃省临夏专区今冬兴修的五十九条渠道，已有六条渠道完工。皋兰县石洞、水川两区已挖成水平沟三万一千六百多丈。据皋兰、会宁、永靖、临夏、榆中等县的统计，今年地冻前可扩大灌溉面积四万零七百多亩。山东省今冬除完成秋季未完成的一百多项工程外，并要恢复汛期被冲毁的工程，同时加强原有井渠和提水工具等水利设施的修补工作，以便完成冬季浇麦三百万亩。
    现在，云南省已结合整修塘坝及时关蓄雨水。十月份楚雄、玉溪、蒙自等专区的塘坝，蓄水已达百分之八十以上。祥云、建水、曲溪、开远等县已蓄到百分之九十。河南省今冬即要扩大灌溉二十万亩。
