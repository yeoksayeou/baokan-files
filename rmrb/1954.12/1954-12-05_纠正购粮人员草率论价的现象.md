Correcting the Phenomenon of Careless Pricing by Grain Purchasing Personnel

Editor:

This year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has joyfully celebrated a bumper harvest of autumn grain! At present, on this boundless fertile land, farmers are squinting their smiling eyes, raising their whips, and urging their livestock, busily transporting grain to sell to the state.

In order to protect the interests of farmers, the government stipulated a "grading and pricing" policy in the unified purchase of grain. This policy has been well implemented in most areas. However, many grain depot staff members in some areas have not seriously graded and priced grain. Some even abuse their power for personal gain, violating national policies, dampening farmers' enthusiasm for selling grain, and hindering the smooth progress of the state's grain purchasing work.

Liu Cunian, a quality inspection personnel at the Xingsheng Grain Depot in Linhe, Hetao, once told a fellow villager during grain inspection: "Your grain is not good enough for first grade, and too high for second grade, so clean it up a bit!" When the villager cleaned it and brought it back for a second inspection, Liu Cunian said again: "Your grain is not good enough for second grade, and too high for third grade, so we'll price it as third grade!" No wonder farmers criticize such "quality inspection personnel" for "not knowing a gold mine when they see one!"

Similar things have also happened in the Ulanqab League area. Farmers in Qiaoqiqi Township, Shiguai Gou Mining Area, Ulanqab League, sold buckwheat of the same quality to the Shiguai Gou Grain Depot and the Sanchakou Cooperative purchasing point respectively. At the grain depot, it was rated as third grade, while at the cooperative purchasing point, it was rated as second grade. The farmers said: "We are all under the leadership of Chairman Mao, why is the same grain given two different prices?"

Even worse, the work style of some quality inspection personnel at the Jinlongwangmiao Grain Depot in Baotou is extremely improper. They often arbitrarily raise the grade of grain for their acquaintances and relatives. Zhang Lan (landlord component) from Dajingerping Village, District 1, in the suburbs had millet that should have been classified as third grade, but it was classified as first grade; while the millet of farmer Gao Wushier, which was the same as Zhang Lan's, was classified as fourth grade.

"Grading and pricing" is a very detailed task. Even a slight defect or deviation will not only harm the interests of farmers but also create adverse political and economic effects for the Party and the People's Government. Therefore, the relevant units mentioned above should promptly inspect and correct the shortcomings. Those irresponsible staff members should be criticized and educated; those whose circumstances are egregious should be dealt with seriously.

### 纠正购粮人员草率论价的现象

    纠正购粮人员草率论价的现象编辑同志：
    今年，内蒙古自治区秋粮喜庆丰收！眼前，在这千里无垠的沃野上，庄稼人正眯着笑眼，扬起鞭儿，吆喝牲口，忙着运粮食去卖给国家。
    政府为了保护农民的利益，在统购粮食中规定了“分等论价”政策，大部分地区对这个政策是贯彻得好的，但是，有不少地区的粮库工作人员，没有认真分等论价，甚至借权徇私，违反国家的政策，打击农民的售粮热情，妨碍国家购粮工作的顺利进行。
    河套临河兴胜粮库检验质量人员刘存年，有一次验粮时对老乡说：“你的粮一等不够，二等太高，收拾一下吧！”老乡收拾后第二次拿来要求验收时，刘存年又说：“你的粮二等不够，三等高，就作三等价吧！”这样的“检验质量人员”，难怪农民批评他们“有眼不识金山玉”！
    这类事情还发生在乌兰察布盟地区。乌盟石拐沟矿区乔屹齐乡的农民，拿同等质量的荞麦分别到石拐沟粮库和三岔口合作社代购点出售，到粮库的被评为三等，在合作社代购点的被评为二等。农民说：“都是毛主席领导的，为什么一样粮食评为两个价钱？”
    更糟糕的是包头金龙王庙粮库的某些检验质量人员的工作作风极不正派。他们对自己的熟人和亲戚朋友的粮食，常常任意提高等级。城郊一区大井尔坪村张兰（地主成份）的谷子本来应划为三等，却划成一等；农民高五十二和张兰一样的谷子倒划为四等。
    “分等论价”是一件十分细致的工作，稍有缺点或偏差，不但会损害农民的利益，而且会给党和人民政府造成政治上经济上的不良影响。因此，上述的各有关单位应该及时检查，纠正缺点。对那些不负责任的工作人员进行批评教育；对情节恶劣的，应作严肃处理。
