    Cheering for the Reclamation of Three Million Hectares in Heilongjiang

    To the Editor:
    Recently, our country successively made the decisions to establish large-scale grain farms in Heilongjiang Province with the help of the Soviet Union and to reclaim three million hectares of wasteland in Heilongjiang Province. This really makes me excited, cheering, and even wanting to jump up.
    I have been engaged in agricultural work since 1948. Since I started working in water conservancy, I have felt that Heilongjiang Province is so rich in water resources. I personally inspected a dam (spillway) that can irrigate 4,000 hectares (60,000 mu) of land and a 1,100-meter water diversion tunnel project; I saw the rice fields by the Muling River and the happy life of the farmers there after liberation. At that time, I also saw that the original Heilongjiang Province was developing the Chahayang Irrigation Area, and the original Songjiang Province was also building the Songhua River electric pumping irrigation project east of Harbin. This made me see the richness of water resources in the entire Heilongjiang Province and the Party's concern for agricultural production.
    When I was in the army, I walked through the north and south areas of Jiamusi, and I walked along the Heilongjiang River to Luobei, Foshan, Wuyun, Qike, and Xunhe. During my work in agricultural administration, I almost traveled all over the original Songjiang Province. I saw that on this land, there were rivers and water conservancy everywhere, fertile black soil everywhere, and abundant crops everywhere. Here, in late spring and early summer, colorful wildflowers bloom all over the mountains, and in summer, everything is lush green; in autumn, the fields are filled with boundless soybeans, sorghum, and golden rice, and in the mountains, many wild fruits ripen, emitting fragrance; in winter, it is a world of ice and snow, and the mountains are like piles of jade, becoming more and more beautiful as you go north. Here, the liberated farmers work enthusiastically in the fields in spring, summer, and autumn. After winter, some go into the mountains to hunt, and some drive rubber-tired carts and sleds, rushing from the countryside to the cities and from the cities to the countryside, transporting various materials on the roads.
    Fertile land, hardworking farmers, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, they are striding towards the road of collectivization and mechanization. In 1950, Liu Wenbin's mutual aid team in Xiaomingjia Village, Jixian County, was the first to use horse-drawn agricultural machinery. In 1951, Xu Liansheng's mutual aid team in Bao'an Village, Jixian County, took the lead in establishing an agricultural production cooperative. At the same time, the Spark Collective Farm—the first collective farm in New China—appeared, the Huachuan Tractor Station was established, and then one after another, village after village developed. What a lovely place, lovely people, and lovely socialist prospect! The wilderness here is boundless, the forests here are boundless, the rivers here crisscross, and the water conservancy is rich. Many rivers can be used to build reservoirs and power stations. The province also has nearly 10 million hectares of land that has not been cultivated. As the farmers say, "Beidahuang [Great Northern Wilderness] guarantees a harvest every year, with no bad years." It is a rich and reliable granary for the motherland.
    Now, our motherland has decided to reclaim this wilderness—from Xingkai Lake northward across the Muling River, along the Ussuri River across the Naoli River, to the south bank of the Songhua River, and then from the north bank of the Songhua River to the Heilongjiang River, in this area of river plain in the border area of the motherland; the large-scale grain farms that the Soviet Union helped China establish are almost in the center of this area. Although since 1948, Yong'an, Shuguang, Jixian, Suibin, Fuerji River, Baoquanling and other mechanical farms have been successively established on this land, each farm cultivating several thousand hectares of land; but for this large area of land, they are still like stars in the sky. Now, dozens of mechanized farms will be established on this large area of land, thousands of agricultural machines will be started, and boundless, lush wheat, soybeans, and sugar beets will grow, and thousands of herds of cattle and sheep will be grazed; several highways will also be built, combined with the convenience of navigation on the Ussuri River, Songhua River, and Heilongjiang River, and connected with the existing railways nearby, passing through Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, and Harbin, and leading to the heart of the motherland. From here, grain, meat, milk, fur, and sugar will be continuously supplied to the motherland. What an inspiring great event!
    Our school is training thousands of young and middle-level agricultural cadres for the motherland. Before this, thousands of students have gone to work, engaged in agricultural mechanization, socialist transformation of agriculture, and agricultural technology to increase production in state-owned farms, tractor stations, and technology promotion stations. In order to train qualified talents for the motherland to engage in this great cause, I will work and study honestly and diligently to meet our glorious and great task.

    Ding Keng, Vice President of Jiamusi Agricultural School, Heilongjiang Province

    Let the Wilderness Become Fertile Farmland

    To the Editor:
    We are students studying in the state-owned farm surveying training classes in Changchun and Harbin. When we saw the news that our country decided to reclaim three million hectares of wasteland in Heilongjiang Province, each of us was extremely excited! We never imagined that we, these young and ordinary people, would shoulder the important responsibility given to us by the motherland—we will awaken the deeply sleeping wilderness and make it become vast and fertile farmland under the cultivation of tractors. On the newly reclaimed virgin land, countless rice, wheat, soybeans, sorghum... will be produced, which will become a strong pillar of the motherland's socialist construction.
    We, the future farmland surveyors, are determined to eliminate incorrect ideas and correct our learning attitude. We must study hard and conscientiously, strive to master surveying technology, and strive to achieve four or five points in each course and digest the homework in class; at the same time, we must also exercise our bodies well and resolutely achieve "moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic" all-round development, so that we can become strong and useful pioneers and fight to the end for the motherland's farmland surveying cause.

### 为在黑龙江开荒三百万公顷而欢呼

专栏：

    为在黑龙江开荒三百万公顷而欢呼编辑同志：
    最近我国接连地做出在黑龙江省建立接受苏联帮助的大型谷物农场和在黑龙江省开荒三百万公顷的决定，真使我兴奋，欢呼，甚至要跳跃起来。
    我从事农业方面的工作是从一九四八年开始的。自从我做水利工作开始，我就感觉到黑龙江省这个地方水利资源是那样的丰富。我曾亲自去察看过一处可以灌溉四千公顷（六万亩）土地的拦河坝（溢洪堤）和一千一百公尺的引水隧道工程；看过穆稜河畔的稻田和那里农民在解放后的幸福生活。当时，我又看到原来的黑龙江省正在开发查哈阳灌区，原来的松江省也正在建筑着哈尔滨市东的松花江电力抽水灌溉工程。这就使我看到整个黑龙江省水利资源的丰富，和党对于农业生产的关怀。
    在部队的时候我走过了佳木斯的南北地区，我走到了黑龙江沿的萝北、佛山、乌云、奇克、逊河。在做农业行政工作期中，我又几乎走遍了原来的松江全省。我看到这一片土地上，到处是河川水利，到处是肥沃的黑色土壤，到处生长着丰盛的庄稼。这里在春末夏初满山遍野地开着鲜艳的各色各样野花，夏天一片苍翠；秋季，在田里是一望无边的大豆、高粱和金黄色的稻子，在山里许多野生果实成熟了，散发着香味；冬天一片冰天雪地，一座座的山峰像堆琼砌玉一般，愈往北走愈美丽。在这里，解放后的农民们春、夏、秋在田里热情地劳作着，入冬后有的进山打猎，有的赶着胶皮大车，赶着雪橇，从乡村到城市，从城市到乡村，在公路上奔驰着，运送着各种物资。
    肥沃的土地，勤劳的农民，在党和人民政府的领导下他们正在大踏步地奔向合作化、机械化的道路。一九五○年集贤县小明甲村刘文彬互助组第一个使用了马拉机械农具，一九五一年集贤县保安村徐连生互助组带头成立了农业生产合作社，同时星火集体农庄——新中国第一个集体农庄出现了，桦川拖拉机站建立起来了，接着一个跟一个，一村跟一村地发展了。这是多么可爱的地方，可爱的人民，可爱的社会主义远景啊！这里的原野辽阔无边，这里的森林辽阔无边，这里的河川纵横，水利丰富，许多河川可以建立水库，可以建立发电站，全省还有近千万公顷以上的土地没有开垦，它将如农民们所说的：北大荒年年保收，没有坏年头。它是祖国一个丰富可靠的谷仓。
    现在，我们的祖国决定了要开垦这片原野——从兴凯湖往北越过穆稜河，沿着乌苏里江越过挠力河，直到松花江南岸，然后又从松花江北岸直到黑龙江，在这一片祖国边疆的河川平原地带上；苏联帮助我国建立的大型谷物农场差不多正在这片地带的中心。虽然在这片土地上从一九四八年开始已经接连建立了永安、曙光、集贤、绥滨、富尔基河、宝泉岭等机械农场，每个农场都耕种着几千公顷土地；但是对这大片土地来看，毕竟是寥若晨星。现在这一大片土地上将建立几十个机械化农场，开动千百架农业机械，生长起无边的、茂盛的小麦、大豆、制糖甜菜，放牧着千百群牛、羊；还将要修通若干条公路，配合乌苏里江、松花江、黑龙江航行的便利和附近现有的几条铁路相联，经过佳木斯、牡丹江、哈尔滨，通向祖国的心脏。从这里将要源源不绝地供给祖国粮食、肉、乳、皮毛、砂糖，这是多么鼓舞人心的盛举啊！
    我们学校正在为祖国培养着上千名的青年中级农业干部，在这以前已经有上千名的学生走上了工作岗位，在国营农场、拖拉机站、技术推广站从事农业机械化、农业社会主义改造和农业技术增产的工作。为了给祖国培养出合乎规格的人材来从事这项巨大的事业，我要老老实实、勤勤恳恳地工作、学习，来迎接我们的光荣的伟大的任务。
    黑龙江省佳木斯农业学校副校长　丁　铿
    让荒野变成肥沃的良田编辑同志：
    我们是在长春、哈尔滨两地国营农场勘测训练班学习的学员。当看见我国决定在黑龙江省开荒三百万公顷的消息的时候，我们每一个人都异常兴奋！想不到我们这些年青的、平凡的人，就将要担负起祖国给我们的重大责任了——我们将要把沉沉熟睡的荒野唤醒，使它在拖拉机的耕作下变成辽阔肥沃的良田。在新开垦出来的处女地上，将要生产出无数的水稻、小麦、大豆、高粱……，将要成为祖国社会主义建设的有力支柱。
    我们未来的农田勘测者，决心清除不正确思想，端正学习态度。我们要艰苦、认真地学习，努力掌握勘测技术，争取做到每门功课都达到四分五分、当堂课业当堂消化；同时也要好好锻炼身体，坚决做到“德、智、体、美”四育并进，使自己成为一个结实的、有用的拓荒者，为祖国的农田勘测事业而奋斗到底。
