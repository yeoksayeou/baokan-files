The Kangzang Highway, crossing the "Roof of the World," is now essentially complete.

The Kangzang Highway stretches 2,255 kilometers from Ya'an City in Xikang Province to Lhasa in Tibet, construction having begun in 1950. This highway crosses over a dozen snow-capped mountains thousands of meters above sea level and spans rivers with steep cliffs on both sides and rapid currents, making the project exceptionally arduous. The People's Liberation Army soldiers and workers responsible for the road construction, with the active support of the Tibetan people, built roads and paved the way with perseverance. The construction and opening of the Kangzang Highway are of great significance for consolidating national defense, strengthening the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities, promoting economic and cultural exchanges between the interior and Tibet, and promoting China's socialist construction.

In the earthwork operations of the Kangzang Highway, soldiers of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army created a method of transporting earth with sliding poles, reducing physical labor and improving work efficiency.

New machines are constantly appearing on the Kangzang Highway construction site. Road construction workers are using an "electric gate to push the clutch" to work.

In order to complete the Kangzang Highway as soon as possible, Tibetan people in the Tibetan region organized yak transport teams to transport a large number of materials to support the construction of the Kangzang Highway.

The Kangzang Highway must pass through primitive forests and quicksand areas. This is the road-building unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army working intensely in the quicksand area.

The remote mountainous areas passed by the Kangzang Highway have begun to change their old appearance. New houses have been built on the desolate slopes of Tuoba.

Trade has become active in the areas where the Kangzang Highway has opened. This shows Tibetan merchants setting up tents in Lulang on the highway to conduct transactions.

The last mountain on the Kangzang Highway - Seqi La Mountain has been opened. The soldiers participating in the construction waved red flags and tools excitedly to welcome the first motorcade to drive to the top of the mountain.

    越过“世界屋脊”的康藏公路
    越过“世界屋脊”的康藏公路已经基本完工。
    康藏公路徒西康雅安市到西藏拉萨全长二千二百五十五公里，一九五零年开始修筑。这条公路越过十几座海拔几千公尺的终年积雪的大山，横渡两岸峭壁矗立、水流湍急的河流，工程异常艰巨。担负筑路工程的解放军战士和工人们，在藏族人民的积极支援下，以坚韧不拔的精神开山铺路。康藏公路的修筑和通车，对巩固国防、加强汉藏民族团结、促进内地与西藏之间经济与文化的交流和推动我国的社会主义建设，都有极其重大的意义。
