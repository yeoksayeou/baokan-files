Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 9th: The Korean Central News Agency published a commentary on the 8th, denouncing the so-called "common defense treaty" signed between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The commentary pointed out that the signing of this war treaty by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group is an open provocative act of attempting to permanently occupy Taiwan and instigate a new war in Asia. The United States attempts to link the US-Chiang treaty with the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and the "Northeast Asia alliance" being planned, to expand its aggression against China and provoke a new war in Asia. The commentary pointed out that this conspiracy of the United States is a dangerous game of playing with fire.

The commentary pointed out that today, the great Chinese people have a strong force to give a firm rebuff to all provocative acts of the American aggressors who attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs and prevent China from exercising its sovereignty. The will of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and consolidate Asian and world peace is invincible. The commentary pointed out that the Korean people sternly condemn the criminal act of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in signing the so-called "common defense treaty." The Korean people firmly support the unwavering determination and just struggle of the great Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. The Korean people are convinced that the Chinese people will surely be able to liberate Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 9th: "Daily Review" published a commentary in its political commentary column on the 8th, denouncing the US-Chiang treaty. The commentary said that this treaty is to legalize the US infringement of Chinese sovereignty and to legalize US aggression against China. The commentary said that the Chinese people have already announced their unwavering will to liberate Taiwan. Nothing can make them relax the task of liberating Taiwan, and liberating Taiwan is entirely China's internal affair.

The commentary said that the people of Europe believe that the US-Chiang treaty is one of the actions of the United States that seriously threaten Asian security, such as the establishment of the Southeast Asia alliance and the intervention in South Vietnam.
Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: According to the Romanian News Agency Bucharest on the 8th: "Free Romania" published a commentary entitled "The American Conspiracy in the Far East," condemning the "common defense treaty" signed between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The commentary said that this treaty is intended to enable the US ruling group to permanently occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, which the US ruling group intends to use as military bases for its aggression against China and other Asian countries. This treaty is part of the US aggressive plan to establish a Northeast Asian military alliance against China. The commentary said that this treaty will increase tensions in Asia and endanger peace in Asia. World public opinion sternly condemns this aggressive conspiracy of the US ruling group to undermine peace in Asia and the world. The commentary said that the Chinese people cannot sit idly by in the face of these provocative acts. They are determined to strengthen their own forces in order to give a well-deserved rebuff to all those who attempt to infringe upon their sovereignty and territorial integrity.
