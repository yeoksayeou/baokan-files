The East China Coal Mining Bureau overfulfilled its November raw coal production plan by 6.24%, increasing raw coal production by more than 40,000 tons for the country; the total tunneling progress also completed the monthly footage plan.

In November, all six production units under the East China Coal Mining Bureau completed the state's raw coal production plan. Huainan Mining Bureau completed 108%, Zibo Mining Bureau completed 105%, Jiawang Mining Bureau completed 107%, Taozhuang Coal Mine completed 103%, Xinwen Coal Mine completed 107%, and Fangzi Coal Mine completed 102%. In tunneling work, Huainan Mining Bureau and Fangzi Coal Mine completed the footage plan better, both exceeding the plan.

The East China Coal Mining Bureau's increase production and practice economy campaign started relatively late, and leaders at all levels had complacency, so they did not complete the monthly plan in October, under-producing more than 5,000 tons of raw coal. In late October, the Bureau tightened its grip to reverse this serious situation, struggled against complacency, and strengthened scheduling work; in late October and early November, each bureau and mine thoroughly mobilized employees to carry out the increase production and practice economy campaign; the Bureau also cooperated with party committees at all levels to send working groups to each bureau and mine to provide specific assistance, overcoming various production obstacles in management and technology. These efforts played a significant role in completing the November raw coal production plan. Recently, the Bureau called on all employees to continue their efforts to strive for overfulfilling the task of increasing production and practicing economy of 510,000 tons of raw coal.

    华东煤矿超额完成上月计划
    华东煤矿管理局以超额百分之六点二四完成了十一月份原煤产量计划，为国家增产原煤四万余吨；掘进总进度也完成了月进尺计划。
    在十一月份，华东煤矿管理局所属六个生产单位，都完成了国家原煤产量计划。淮南矿务局完成百分之一○八，淄博矿务局完成一○五，贾汪矿务局完成一○七，陶庄煤矿完成一○三，新汶煤矿完成一○七，坊子煤矿完成一○二。掘进工作以淮南矿务局和坊子煤矿完成进尺计划较好，都超额完成了计划。
    华东煤矿管理局各单位增产节约运动开展较迟，各级领导又存在着自满情绪，因而十月没有完成月计划，欠产原煤五千多吨。十月下旬管理局抓紧扭转这种严重局面，向自满情绪作斗争，加强调度工作；各局、矿在十月下旬和十一月初，深入动员职工开展增产节约运动；管理局并配合各级党委派出工作组，到各局、矿进行具体帮助，在管理上和技术上克服了各种生产障碍。这些工作对完成十
  一月份原煤生产计划起了不小的作用。最近管理局号召全体职工为争取超额完成五十一万吨原煤的增产节约任务继续努力。
