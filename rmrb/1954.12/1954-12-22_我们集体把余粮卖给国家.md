    We Collectively Sell Surplus Grain to the State
    Xu Xiangbao, Member of Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative, Jintong Township, Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province

    I am a poor peasant, and for most of my life, I was a grain-deficient household. This year, after joining the agricultural production cooperative, my rice production increased by more than 2,000 jin compared to previous years. I truly realized that the path of collectivization pointed out by the Communist Party is excellent. However, after the autumn harvest, when the state wanted to implement unified grain purchase, I had ideological concerns. The work comrade stationed in the cooperative knew that my thinking on the unified grain purchase was not clear, so he explained many reasons to me. He told me that unified grain purchase and marketing are greatly related to our country's construction of socialism. Finally, he said to me:
  “Xiangbao, before joining the cooperative, you were a grain-deficient household. In the past, when grain was not subject to unified purchase and marketing, how much suffering did you endure at the hands of unscrupulous merchants? Before liberation, have you forgotten the beatings and scoldings you received from Chiang Kai-shek's troops?” His question made my nose tingle instantly, and bitterness welled up in my heart. I remember in 1949, there was a major flood, causing an autumn famine. My family ran out of food, and it was impossible to buy any locally. I carried several packages of yarn, traveling dozens of miles to Zhutang Town, where one package of yarn could only be exchanged for four dou of damp rice from private merchants. But this year, the flood was bigger than in 1949, yet rice prices did not rise. I bought a total of 597 jin of rice and more than 100 jin of flour from the state, and the prices were fair. If it weren't for the implementation of unified grain purchase and marketing, with such a big flood this year, the people would have suffered immensely at the hands of unscrupulous merchants, and our agricultural production cooperative would probably have collapsed long ago. Now the cooperative has been consolidated and has achieved a bumper harvest. These are all the benefits of unified purchase and marketing. Mentioning the suffering endured under Chiang Kai-shek's troops makes my anger flare up. At the end of 1947, Chiang Kai-shek's troops seized my door to build fortifications. When I refused, several Chiang Kai-shek soldiers grabbed me and gave me a severe beating. Even now, when I think about it, tears well up in my eyes. Selling surplus grain to support the liberation of Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and finally complete our country's unification, defending our good life, can you still not understand?”
    At this point, I looked up at the work comrade, and said embarrassedly, "Comrade, I have no other concerns, I'm just afraid that the grain we keep for ourselves won't be enough to eat." The work comrade interjected, "You say it won't be enough, then calculate it. How much did you actually harvest? How much do you eat in a year?" After he said this, I calculated: my family of nine people eats less than 3,000 jin of grain in a year. I said with a smile: "As long as we are careful and frugal, it will not only be enough, but there will be plenty left over."
    After the work comrade's propaganda and explanation, I realized that unified purchase and marketing are not only beneficial to me personally, but are even more beneficial to the country and the people. Our country is a big family, and products from urban and rural areas should be exchanged with each other. For example, those of us who produce grain have no clothes to wear. Farmers who grow cotton sell cotton to the state according to the national plan, and the state supplies us with cloth in a planned way. We farmers who grow grain sell the surplus grain to the state, and the state supplies it to industrial and mining cities and economic crop areas in a planned way, and also supplies the People's Liberation Army and grain-deficient households in rural areas. If everyone was like me, hoarding surplus grain at home and not selling it to the state, what would all the grain-deficient people in the country eat? Every day we say we want to build socialism, how can we build socialism like this?
    Thinking like this, my mind became even clearer, and I resolutely decided to sell the surplus grain to the state, to support national industrialization, to support the liberation of Taiwan, and to support the people in disaster areas. After my own thinking was clear, I had the strength to persuade everyone else. At a general meeting of cooperative members to discuss selling grain, I introduced to everyone how my thinking had changed and calculated my family's grain consumption account, and everyone listened attentively. Xu Mingbao, who was sitting next to me, stood up and said: "I was the loudest in saying that I was afraid there wouldn't be enough grain to eat. After Xiangbao mentioned it today, I calculated it, and there's plenty of grain. Without calculation, my mind is confused, but with calculation, my heart is settled. I agree to sell all of the cooperative's more than 40,000 jin of surplus grain to the state at once." As soon as he finished speaking, many cooperative members said in unison: "Agree, agree, let's act quickly."
    After selling the grain, I discussed a production plan with my wife: take 150,000 yuan to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy sweet potatoes, oil, salt, and daily necessities, pay back 150,000 yuan in loans to the credit cooperative, put 200,000 yuan in the cooperative for winter and spring production investment, and have 400,000 to 500,000 yuan deposited in the National Bank by the cooperative in a unified way to support national construction.

    我们集体把余粮卖给国家
    江苏省江阴县金童乡新华农业合作社社员　徐相宝
    我是个贫农，大半辈子是个缺粮户。今年参加农业生产合作社，比往年增产了两千多斤稻子，我真正体会到共产党指给我们的合作化的道路真好。但在秋收后，国家要统购粮食时，我思想上有顾虑。驻社的工作同志晓得我对粮食统购思想不通，就向我讲了许多道理，他告诉我粮食统购统销对我们国家建设社会主义有很大关系，最后他对我说：
  “相宝，入社前，你是个缺粮户，过去粮食不统购统销，你吃过奸商多少苦头？解放前，你给蒋贼军打骂，忘记没有？”给他这一问，我顿时鼻子一酸，苦水直往心上涌。记得一九四九年遭大水，闹秋荒，家里断了口粮，当地又买不到，我挑了几包纱，赶几十里路到祝塘镇，一包纱向私商只换四斗潮米。今年呢，水比一九四九年大，米价没有涨。我一共向国家买了五百九十七斤大米，一百多斤面粉，价钱都不吃亏。要不是实行粮食统购统销，今年这么大的水，人民不知要吃奸商多少苦，我们农业生产合作社怕也早垮台啦；现在合作社得到了巩固，并得到了丰收，这都是统购统销的好处。提到过去吃蒋贼军的苦，我的火就直冒：一九四七年底，蒋贼军抢我的大门做工事，我不肯，给几个蒋贼军抓起来一顿毒打，现在一想起，就掉眼泪。卖余粮支援解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，最后完成我们国家的统一，保卫我们的好日子，还想不通吗？
    这时我抬头向工作同志看了一眼，难为情地说：“同志，别的顾虑没有啦，怕只怕留的口粮不够吃。”工作同志接口说：“你说不够吃，那你算一下，你实收多少？一年吃多少？”给他这样一说，我算了一下：一家大小九口人，全年一共吃不到三千斤粮，我笑着说：“只要精打细算，不但够吃，而且还多多有余呢。”
    经过工作同志向我宣传解释后，我认识到统购统销不但对我个人有利，对国家对人民的利益可更大哩。我们国家是个大家庭，城乡的产品应该互相交流。比方说，我们生产粮食的人没有衣服穿，种棉花的农民按国家计划把棉花卖给国家，由国家有计划地供应给我们布匹，我们种粮食的农民把余粮卖给国家，由国家有计划地供应工矿城市和经济作物区，同时也供应解放军以及农村缺粮户。如果大家都像我，有了余粮囤在家里不卖给国家，全国所有缺粮人民吃什么？天天说要建设社会主义，这样还建设什么社会主义呢？
    这样一想，我心里更亮堂起来，坚决把余粮卖给国家，支援国家工业化、支援解放台湾、支援灾区人民。我自己思想通了，说服大家就有力量，在一次开社员大会上讨论卖粮时，我向大家介绍了自己的思想怎样变过来，算了全家的口粮消费账，大家听得出神。坐在我身旁的徐明宝站起来说：“怕口粮不够吃，我叫得顶凶，相宝今天一提头，我一算，口粮尽够吃了，不算账，心里糊涂，一算账，心就定了。我同意把全社的四万多斤余粮，一次卖给国家。”他的话一落音，好多社员连声说：“赞成，赞成，趁早行动。”
    卖粮后，我跟老婆打一下生产谱：拿十五万元到供销社买山芋、油、盐、日用品，十五万元还信用合作社贷款，二十万元放在社里作冬、春季生产投资，还有四、五十万元，由社里统一存入国家银行，支援国家建设。（孙凯记）
