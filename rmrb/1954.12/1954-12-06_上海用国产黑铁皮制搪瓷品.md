    Shanghai Uses Domestic Black Iron Sheet to Produce Enamelware
    Our country's black iron sheet for manufacturing enamelware has always been dependent on imports, and the state has to pay a large amount of foreign exchange every year to purchase black iron sheet. In order to save foreign exchange and support industrial construction, the China National Department Store Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station and the Hardware Company Shanghai Branch, after half a year of testing, have rolled thick iron sheet produced by Anshan Iron and Steel Company into black iron sheet of 10 inches or less in July this year. Recently, the Shanghai Sino-Private Joint Shunfeng Enamel Factory successfully trial-produced enamel mouthwash cups, and the product quality met the standards. This black iron sheet of 10 inches or less can be used to make small enamel mouthwash cups, rice bowls, vegetable basins, etc. From December this year, state-owned supply and marketing departments have begun to distribute this black iron sheet to the enamel industry in Shanghai, and it is estimated that it can reduce the import of black iron sheet by more than 2,000 tons each year. Relevant departments are also preparing to expand the processing of domestic black iron sheet of more than 12 inches in 1955 for manufacturing large enamelware. (Cheng Yongchao, Qian Tingfang)

    上海用国产黑铁皮制搪瓷品
    我国制造搪瓷品用的黑铁皮，一向依赖进口，国家每年为购买黑铁皮要支付很大一笔外汇。为了节省外汇，支援工业建设，中国百货公司上海采购供应站和五金公司上海分公司，经过半年试验，已在今年七月将鞍山钢铁公司生产的厚铁皮，轧制成十吋以下的黑铁皮；并在最近经上海公私合营顺风搪瓷厂试制搪瓷漱口杯获得成功，产品质量符合标准。用这种十吋以下的黑铁皮，可以做小的搪瓷漱口杯、饭碗、菜盆等。从今年十二月份起，国营供销部门已开始将这种黑铁皮配售给上海的搪瓷业，估计每年可减少进口黑铁皮两千余吨。有关部门并准备在一九五五年扩大加工十二寸以上的国产黑铁皮，用以制造大的搪瓷品。　（程咏潮　钱庭芳）
