    From Losses to Surplus
    Zhang Shuren, Deputy Director of Anshan Iron and Steel Works Medium Plate Factory
    Costs Always Overran, Resulting in Heavy Losses
    Looking back at the beginning of last year, our concept of economic accounting was, to say the least, very vague. At that time, because the production tasks were never completed, the factory's leaders were busy with production all day long and didn't bother to ask about cost accounting. Whatever measures the factory took, they only considered from the perspective of production technology and never considered how much money was spent or where it was spent. Raw materials were not subject to quota management; whatever was needed was taken. From January to August, a total of 7.1 billion yuan was lost.
    The situation was too serious. We thought of many ways and managed to reverse the cost overrun in September. However, this was just treating the symptoms, patching up whatever was wasting the most, without fundamentally solving the problem from the perspective of cost accounting and management. At the same time, because the overrun in the first half of the year was too large, the annual cost plan was still not completed.
    At the end-of-year work summary, the main shortcoming of 1953 was cost overruns. Therefore, the Party General Branch Committee decided that this problem must be fundamentally solved in 1954.
    Learning Cost Management and Establishing Systems
    On the first day of work in 1954, a factory-wide cadre meeting was held. At the meeting, Yang Baotai, the Deputy Secretary of the General Branch, analyzed that the main reason for the cost overruns in our factory was that the cadres didn't understand business management. Although everyone wanted to comprehensively complete the plan, they didn't know where to start with reducing costs. Therefore, we decided to strengthen management on the one hand and organize everyone to learn cost management on the other.
    On January 10th, the General Branch began to organize cadres to study. In the past, many cadres thought, "If the cost is high, just sell it at a higher price; we have to make money anyway." Some thought, "The country just needs steel plates. As long as it's needed for production, the cost doesn't matter." Others thought, "Reducing costs is just saving some oil and rags; it's nothing great." After learning and discussion, everyone understood that reducing costs is the main source of capital accumulation for the country. Reducing costs not only means saving oil and rags in small ways, but mainly means increasing output, saving raw materials, reducing defective products, and increasing by-products in large ways, in the production process.
    At the same time, the Economic Accounting Section also began to establish management systems. All management expenses were strictly controlled according to the cost plan, and no expenses were allowed outside the plan. Consumption quotas for various materials were formulated for each unit, and management was strictly based on quotas, with no over-issuance allowed. All production technology measures had to be calculated by the Economic Accounting Section and decided after reasonable arrangements were made. In this way, the cost work began to take shape. However, at this time, we discovered a new problem, which was that the consumption quota of steel billets—the raw material accounting for 80% of the cost—was not completed. This was a key issue in cost management, and like output and quality, it was determined in the production process. How could cost management grasp the living factors that are constantly changing in the production process? We explored repeatedly but could not figure out a way.
      Organizing a Team-Based Savings Accounting Competition
    In March, the comrades of the Economic Accounting Section learned about the team-based savings accounting method of the heavy rail steel beam workshop of the Petrovsky Metallurgical Factory in the Soviet Union. This advanced experience solved the problem we were struggling with.
    The practice of this advanced experience is: Every day, the various planned targets of each team are announced, and the economic value of each target is indicated. Then, the results of its implementation are announced the next day, and the amount of money saved or wasted for the country is calculated. At that time, we realized that this approach had the following advantages:
    First, accounting on a daily basis can promptly reflect production achievements and problems in production.
    Second, accounting for various major indicators by team, and these indicators are the direct result of the workers' daily labor, thus linking cost management with production activities. At the same time, through the comparison of execution results and plans, the distance between production and planned targets can be found. If the workers notice this distance, they can find the reasons for failing to complete the plan and overcome them, and they can find the potential in production to strive to complete the state plan comprehensively and overfulfill it. Moreover, it can prevent and correct the bias of only paying attention to output and not paying attention to other indicators.
    Third, the daily results are an evaluation of the production results of the day, and the accumulated results are a summary of the production achievements of a period. Using this method to organize competitions can enrich the content of the competition and closely combine it with production management and comprehensive completion of the state plan. Finally, through the results of the accounting, through the comparison of the implementation of each indicator with the plan, it can also help the leadership to check the work of grassroots leaders and grassroots Party organizations.
    Therefore, we decided to start piloting this experience from April in the rolling and shearing teams, which play a decisive role in the factory's production, and formulated various corresponding quotas and indicators.
    These methods were all deployed at the cadre meeting, and the chairman of the trade union also announced that the team-based accounting competition would be implemented from April.
    Let the Masses Understand the Significance of Team-Based Accounting
    On April 1st, the results of the first accounting were announced in the workshop competition newspaper. After a long period of preparation, we expected that the start might be relatively smooth. But the fact was not so. All three shifts were over budget on the first day, and they continued to be over budget for days afterwards, and it was getting worse every day. After a deep investigation, we found that the targets for the second quarter were higher than those for the first quarter, and April was the first month of production according to the new targets. If production continued in the old way, the planned requirements could not be met. Secondly, the cadres did not pay attention to this matter, and they did not convey it properly after the meeting. The workers did not know what to account for, and some did not even know that the team-based accounting competition was being implemented.
    Based on these circumstances, the trade union convened a workers' meeting of the three shifts, and Li Yongren, the chairman of the trade union, explained to the workers in detail the practice and significance of the team-based accounting competition. The workers understood that what was being accounted for was the achievements of everyone's work, and they understood the relationship between the team-based accounting competition and the comprehensive completion of the state plan and the realization of socialist industrialization, and they began to pay attention to the accounting results. At this time, the comrades of the Economic Accounting Section also gave everyone a lecture on the results of the daily accounting and the problems found in the accounting before each shift change. For example, they told the workers of Team A that although their production results yesterday saved a certain amount in total, only the quality, raw material quota, and small and medium plates completed the plan, while the output was reduced by a certain number of tons due to mechanical failure. This means that if Team A had avoided the mechanical failure yesterday and overfulfilled the output plan, they could have created more wealth. After listening to the explanation, the workers discussed how the accident was caused yesterday, whose responsibility it was, and how to avoid it in the future. For the shift directors, the method we adopted was to go to the site every day to find them and bring them to the accounting board to test them, asking them the reasons why each target was completed or not completed, and asking what measures they were prepared to take to complete the unfulfilled targets. In this way, we helped them master this weapon of leading production while testing them.
    However, at this time, the situation of overspending was still not reversed. The workers' morale was very low, saying, "Although this competition method is good, all three shifts are overspending. Who will be rated first at the end of the month?"
    Finding the Reasons and Finding Solutions
    We further checked the reasons for the overspending. From the summary of April 1st to 18th, we saw that the main reason for the overspending was that the steel billet consumption quota was not completed. Therefore, we organized forces to conduct a detailed inspection from steel billets to finished products and found that the negative tolerance of the steel billets sent by the primary rolling mill was too large, and 562 tons would be lost for every 10,000 tons of steel billets. On the other hand, our factory's production was unable to control the negative tolerance, and the so-called 10,000 tons of finished products were actually much heavier than 10,000 tons. In addition, the operating technology was not good, and there were many cases of rolling short, rolling narrow, and rolling oblique, resulting in less finished product and raw material consumption exceeding the quota.
    However, during these eighteen days, Team B's steel billet consumption quota was not exceeded. It turned out that Team B paid attention to this problem at the beginning of the team accounting. The scheduler, Comrade Liu Zhirong, learned the algorithm during the class and reported the situation to the shift director at any time during production. Comrade Zeng Zhaoying, the liaison officer, carefully studied the changes in the rolling mill in the inspection of finished products and improved the inspection method, so that the tolerance of each day's products could be found appropriately. When the chief engineer and branch secretary, Tian Lisheng, found that the steel billet consumption quota exceeded the plan, he found the rolling driver, liaison officer, and marker together to find the reasons. Then, everyone set about correcting it in their respective positions. Finally, Team B broke through this key problem.
    We found the reasons for the overspending and also found Team B's method, so we promoted it to the shift directors and workers of the three shifts, explaining where the reason for losing money was and introducing Team B's experience. With this calculation, everyone suddenly understood, and the situation began to gradually improve. Team B's savings were consolidated and continued to increase. Team C strived to eliminate the overspending for the whole month in the last two days of the month. Team A also reduced from an overspending of 151.162 million yuan to 15.55 million yuan.
    Once the end of the month was over, we seized the opportunity to summarize, held forums for old workers and cadres, summarized who had improved the operation, improved production, and reduced costs in the past month, and organized discussions to criticize incorrect understandings.
    Set Off a New Production Upsurge
    This time, the enthusiasm of the masses was high, and they expressed that they must learn from Team B's practice. From April 1st to 15th, all three shifts were overspending, and there was no place to hang the red flag. The situation was completely different once it entered May, and the winning red flag was not empty for a single day. The three shifts chased each other closely, and the total savings for the month reached 569.68 million yuan. When the red flag was hung in that shift, the workers' joyful mood was truly indescribable.
    Team-based accounting has been consolidated and has greatly promoted the central task—strengthening technical management. Because the workers can understand the relationship between implementing operating procedures and production from the daily accounting results, they all earnestly implement the operating procedures and automatically improve labor organization and strengthen the post responsibility system to better implement the operating procedures. As a result, the quality rose sharply, and the first-class product rate increased by more than 60% in a very short period. These achievements in turn encouraged everyone's production enthusiasm, and the competition became even more intense. Now, under the slogan of "Completing the National Plan Comprehensively 20 Days in Advance," the three shifts have set off a new production upsurge.
    The development of team-based accounting has played a huge role in promoting our factory's completion of the national plan. Taking the cost plan as an example, if the total reduction in the first quarter before the accounting is 100, then the second quarter after the accounting is 390, and the third quarter is 505. Although the state's targets have been raised quarter by quarter, it has still accumulated nearly 3 billion yuan in excess.
    This is the simple process of our factory turning from losses to profits.
    Further Implement Accounting for Workshops and Departments
    In this year, our output, quality, and cost can all complete the national plan, but at the same time, there is a serious shortcoming, that is, the variety plan is not well completed. From January to September, the order task has not been completed, which has affected the production and construction work of many brother factories and mines. From October, we re-determined the operating plan implementation regulations and adopted a serious attitude to deal with the behavior of modifying the operating plan and not producing according to the variety. Therefore, in October, except for those that could not be produced due to lack of raw materials, the order tasks have been completed according to the plan. In the future, we are determined to guarantee the completion of all order tasks on schedule and to re-roll the orders that have not been completed before the end of the year.
    Now, in addition to the team-based accounting carried out by the main production teams in our factory, we have also started to implement workshop and department (i.e., various functional institutions) accounting from September, so as to improve the cost accounting work of the whole factory. In this way, we can further improve the management level of the enterprise and accumulate more funds for the country's socialist industrialization.
    (Note) Tolerance: In steel enterprises, the weight of steel is not calculated according to the actual weight, but according to the length, width, and thickness multiplied by the specific gravity to calculate the weight. At the same time, a certain error is allowed for the length, width, and thickness of the product. The actual size is larger than the specified size is called "positive tolerance," and vice versa is called "negative tolerance." Therefore, sometimes there is a distance between the actual weight and the calculated weight.

    从亏累变成有盈余
    鞍钢中板厂副厂长　张树仁
    成本老是超支、赔累十分严重
    回想去年年初，我们的经济核算观念可以说是非常模糊的。那时因为生产任务总完不成，厂的领导干部整天忙着搞生产，根本不去过问成本财务工作。工厂不管采取什么措施，都只从生产技术方面着眼，从不考虑用钱多少和从那里开支。原材料没有实行定额管理，用多少就领多少。从一月到八月，一共赔累了七十一亿元。
    情况太严重了。我们想了很多办法，到九月份扭转了成本超支的情况。但是这时只是头痛医头，脚痛医脚，那方面浪费得最厉害就堵那方面的口子，没有从成本财务管理上，从根本上来解决问题。同时因为上半年超支额过大，全年成本计划还是没完成。
    年底总结工作，一九五三年的主要缺点就是成本超支。于是党的总支委员会作了决定，一九五四年一定要从根本上解决这个问题。
    学习成本管理、建立制度
    一九五四年第一天上班，就召开了全厂干部大会。在会上，总支副书记杨宝太同志分析我厂成本超支的主要原因是干部不懂经营管理工作。虽然大家都想全面完成计划，但是对降低成本就不知道从那里下手。所以我们决定一面加强管理，一面组织大家学习成本管理。
    一月十日，总支开始组织干部学习。过去许多干部认为“成本高就卖贵点，反正得赚钱。” 有的认为：“国家就是需要钢板。只要是生产上需要，成本高低没啥关系。”还有的认为“降低成本只是节省些油和破布，没啥了不起。”经过学习讨论，大家明白了降低成本是国家积累资金的主要来源。降低成本不但要从小处省油省破布，主要的是要从大处、从生产过程中提高产量、节约原材料、减少废品、增加副产品。
    与此同时，经济核算股也开始建立管理制度。各项管理费用都按成本计划严加控制，计划以外的一律不准开支。制定了各个单位各种材料的消耗定额，严格按定额管理，决不多发。所有生产技术上的措施必须经过经济核算股计算，合理安排后才能决定。这样，成本工作就开始有了头绪。但是，这时我们又发现了一个新的问题，就是成本计划虽然能完成了，但是占成本比重百分之八十以上的原料——钢胚的消耗定额却没有完成。这是成本管理中间的一个关键问题，而这和产量、质量一样，是在生产过程里决定的。成本管理工作怎样去掌握生产过程中经常在变化的活的因素呢？我们一再摸索，总是想不出办法来。
      组织班组节约核算竞赛
    到三月，经济核算股的同志们学习了苏联彼得罗夫斯基冶金工厂重轨钢梁车间班组节约核算的办法。这个先进经验解决了我们所苦恼的问题。
    这个先进经验的做法是：每一天把每个班的各项计划指标公布出来，并标明各项指标的经济价值。然后在第二天公布它的执行结果，并且计算出给国家节约或浪费了多少金额。当时我们体会这种做法有这样几个好处：
    第一、按天核算，就能及时把生产成绩和生产中的问题反映出来。
    第二、按班核算各项主要指标，而这些指标就是工人日常劳动的直接结果，这样就把成本管理和生产活动联系了起来。同时通过执行结果和计划的对比，就可以发现生产和计划指标之间的距离。如果工人注意到这个距离，就能找到完不成计划的原因加以克服，就能找到生产中的潜力来争取超额地全面地完成国家计划，而且可以防止和纠正只注意产量，不重视其他指标的偏向。
    第三、每天的成果是当天生产成果的评价，累计的成果则是一个时期生产成绩的总结，用这个办法来组织竞赛，就能使竞赛的内容充实起来，和生产管理，和全面完成国家计划密切地结合起来。最后，通过核算的结果，通过各个指标的执行情况与计划的对比，还可以帮助领导上检查基层领导干部和基层党组织的工作。
    因此，我们决定从四月份起在全厂生产中起决定作用的压延剪断班开始试行这个经验，并制定了与此相应的各项定额和指标。
    这些办法都在干部会议上布置了，工会主席也宣布了从四月份起实行班组核算竞赛。
    让群众了解班组核算的意义
    四月一日在车间竞赛报上公布了第一次核算结果。在经过长期的准备工作后，我们预料开始时可能会比较顺利。但是事实不然，第一天三班都是超支，以后还是连日超支，而且一天比一天厉害。我们深入一了解，原来是第二季的指标比第一季提高了，而四月份是按新指标生产的第一个月，如果照老样子生产，就不能达到计划要求。其次是干部没有重视这件事，开会回来也没好好传达，工人们不知道核算些什么，有的甚至连实行班组核算竞赛都不知道。
    根据这些情况，工会就又召开了三班工人大会，工会主席李永仁同志向工人详细地说明班组核算竞赛的做法和意义。工人们弄明白了所算的就是大伙干活的成绩，明白了班组核算竞赛和全面完成国家计划，和实现社会主义工业化的关系，就开始对核算结果注意了。这时候，经济核算股的同志又在每次交接班前给大家讲当天核算的结果和核算中发现的问题。例如给甲班工人讲昨天他们的生产结果虽然总的是节约了多少，但是只有质量、原料定额，小中板完成了计划，产量则因机械故障减产了多少吨。这就是说，昨天甲班如果避免了机械故障，超额完成产量计划，就能创造更多的财富。工人们听了解释，就联系到昨天事故是怎样造成的，是谁的责任，今后怎样才能避免，展开了讨论。对值班主任，我们采取的办法是每天我到现场去把他们找到核算板前来考试，问他们每项指标完成和没完成的原因，追问对没完成的指标准备采取什么办法完成。这样一面考试一面帮助他们掌握这个领导生产的武器。
    但是，这个时候超支的情况还是没有扭转过来。工人的情绪很低，说：“这个竞赛办法虽然好，可是三个班都超支，月末评比，谁算第一？”
    寻原因，找办法
    我们进一步检查了超支的原因。从四月一日到十八日的小结中，看到超支的主要原因是钢胚消耗定额完不成。于是我们就组织力量从钢胚到成品进行了详细检查，发现了原来初轧厂送来的钢胚负公差（注）太大，一万吨钢胚要少五百六十二吨。另一方面我们厂生产又没有能掌握住负公差，名为一万吨成品，实际要比一万吨重很多。加之操作技术不好，轧短、轧窄、轧斜的情形很多，成品出得少，原料消耗却超过定额。
    可是，在这十八天中间，乙班的钢胚消耗定额却没有超过。原来乙班在班组核算刚开始的时候就注意了这个问题。调度员刘志荣同志在听课时学会了算法，每天在生产中间随时向值班主任反映情况。联络员曾昭英同志在检查成品当中细心研究，发现了轧辊的变化规律，改进了检查的方法，使每天产品的公差都能找得恰当。总工长兼支部书记田立生同志发现钢胚消耗定额超过计划时，就找轧钢司机、联络员、划线员一起找原因。然后每个人都在自己的岗位上分头设法纠正。最后乙班就突破了这个关键问题。
    我们找到了超支的原因，又找到了乙班的方法，就向三班的值班主任和工人宣传，说明赔钱的原因在那里，并介绍乙班的经验。这样一算，大家都恍然大悟，情况就开始逐渐好转。乙班的节约额巩固下来了，而且不断增加。丙班在月末最后两天争取到全月消灭超支。甲班也从超支一亿五千一百六十二万元减少到一千五百五十万元。
    一过月末，我们就抓紧总结，举办老工人和干部座谈会，把一个月来谁用什么方法改进了操作、提高了生产、降低了成本，都总结出来，对错误的认识则组织讨论给以批判。
    掀起了新的生产高潮
    这一下，群众的情绪都高涨起来，表示一定要学习乙班的做法。四月份一日到十五日，三班都超支，红旗没地方挂。一进入五月，情况就完全不同了，优胜红旗没有一天空下来。三班紧紧追赶，全月节约额达到五亿六千九百六十八万元。当红旗挂到那一班时，工人的欢乐情绪真是难以形容。
    班组核算巩固起来了，而且大大地推动了中心工作——加强技术管理。因为工人们从每天的核算成绩中间都能体会到贯彻操作规程和生产的关系，所以都很认真地执行操作规程，并且自动地改进劳动组织，加强岗位责任制，来使操作规程贯彻得更好。这样做的结果，质量直线上升，很短的期间一级品率就提高了百分之六十多。这些成绩反过来又鼓舞了大家的生产热情，竞赛的劲头更大了。现在三个班正在“提前二十天全面完成国家计划”的口号下，掀起了新的生产高潮。
    班组核算工作的开展，对我厂完成国家计划起了巨大的推动作用。仅以成本计划为例，如以核算前第一季总降低额为一百，则开展核算后第二季为三百九十，第三季为五百零五，虽然国家的指标逐季提高，还是超额积累了将近三十亿元。
    这就是我们厂从亏累到盈余的简单经过。
    进一步实行工段和部门的核算
    这一年中，我们的产量、质量、成本都能完成国家计划，但是同时存在一个严重的缺点，就是品种计划完成得不好，从一月到九月一直没有完成订货任务，影响了许多兄弟厂矿的生产建设工作。从十月份起，我们重新确定了作业计划执行条例，对修改作业计划不按品种生产的行为采取了严肃的态度来处理，因此十月份除没有原料不能生产的以外，已按照计划完成了订货任务。今后我们决心要保证按期完成全部订货任务，并且在年前把以前没有完成的订货补轧完了。
    现在我厂除各主要生产班开展了班组核算外，从九月份起又开始实行了工段和部门（即各职能机构）核算，以便把全厂的成本财务工作健全起来。这样，我们就能够进一步提高企业的管理水平，为国家社会主义工业化积累更多的资金。
    （注）公差：在钢铁企业中钢材重量不按实际重量计算，而按长、宽、厚求体积乘以比重，来求出重量。同时对产品的长、宽、厚度允许一定的误差，实际大于规定规格的叫“正公差”，反之叫“负公差”。所以有时实际重量和计算重量之间有距离。
