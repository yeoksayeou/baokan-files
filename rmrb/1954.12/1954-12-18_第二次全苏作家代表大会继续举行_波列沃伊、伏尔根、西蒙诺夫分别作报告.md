Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: The Second All-Union Writers Congress continued its meeting on December 16th, according to TASS.

	In the afternoon session of the 16th, attendees heard Polevoi's report on Soviet children's and youth literature. In his report, he cited figures to illustrate the development of Soviet children's literature over the past twenty years. He said that the number of Soviet children's literature writers has increased from a few to 1,500, and 20,600 kinds of children's literature works have been published, totaling 911.1 million copies. The heroic figures in children's literature works have aroused enthusiastic responses in the hearts of millions of children and young people in the Soviet Union, and have also been very popular abroad.

	Polevoi then said that in addition to many vivid works showing the rich spiritual world of the protagonists, there are also a few works in Soviet children's literature that do not meet the needs of young readers. This is the result of the author's insufficient understanding of life and detachment from reality. Polevoi believes that the theme of great constructive labor across the country is one of the most important themes in Soviet children's literature. Children's literature writers should tirelessly seek out their protagonists and show children the noble qualities of the shining figures in socialist society.

	Next, Azerbaijani poet and translator S. Volgin delivered a report on Soviet poetry.

	In his report, Volgin said that Soviet poetry is a unified multi-ethnic chorus, expressing the brotherly love of all free nationalities of the Soviet Union and the praise of the socialist motherland. Soviet poets also sing of the friendship between all nations in the world, and of the all-pervasive power of proletarian internationalism. They cheer for the best and brightest things at home and around the world. Soviet poetry does not recognize any barriers between the people of the world, and it reflects everything that is exciting.

	When talking about the tasks of Soviet poetry, Volgin said that all the poet's thoughts should be focused on the glorious image of the new socialist person as the creator of new history. We need bold poetic imagination and a broad vision that can see our magnificent reality and brilliant future.

	In the evening session of the 16th, K. Simonov gave a supplementary report on Soviet prose. He first reviewed the development of Soviet prose over the past twenty years in stages, and the characteristics of each stage of development. He then talked about the essence of socialist realism as a creative method, and the correct understanding and application of it by modern writers in their actual work. He said that the path of socialist realism is the only correct and effective path for literature serving the people. In places where the people have already achieved victory, socialist realism has developed into the basic method of literary creation. Soviet writers who create according to the principles of socialist realism pay attention to everything among the people, and love those things that inspire the people to look forward to the future. They do not ignore despicable things, but they believe that only noble thoughts are the nature of mankind. They understand people's weaknesses, but they are eager to cultivate people's moral strength. The infamous "no-conflict theory" that circulated after the war is being fiercely attacked.

	A large part of Simonov's report talked about the issue of improving writers' creative skills. He said that although the quality of our prose in general has improved significantly in the past twenty years, the development of the entire literature and the increasingly strict requirements of Soviet readers have made the struggle to improve quality, especially to improve the quality of prose, very acute now. Simonov emphasized the need to create an atmosphere in the Soviet Union that attaches great importance to the skills of writers.

	Attendees also heard a report by L. Nikulin on behalf of the credentials committee. He said that there were a total of 738 delegates attending this congress, of which 626 had voting rights and 112 had speaking rights. Since the First All-Union Writers Congress, the number and composition of members of the Soviet Writers Association have changed. There are now a total of 3,695 members, more than one and a half times the original number.

    第二次全苏作家代表大会继续举行
    波列沃伊、伏尔根、西蒙诺夫分别作报告
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：第二次全苏作家代表大会十二月十六日继续举行会议。
    在十六日下午会议上，到会者听取了波列沃伊关于苏联儿童文学和少年文学的报告。他在报告中援引了一些数字来说明二十年来苏联儿童文学的发展。他说，苏联儿童文学的作家已经从几个人增加到一千五百人，儿童文学的作品已经出版了两万零六百种，共九亿一千一百万册。儿童文学作品中的英雄人物已经在苏联千百万儿童和青年的心中引起了热烈的反响，而且在国外也受到很大的欢迎。
    波列沃伊接着说，苏联儿童文学中除了许多生动的能显示主人公们丰富的精神世界的作品外，也还有少数作品不能满足少年读者的需要。这是由于作者对生活了解得不够、脱离了现实的结果。波列沃伊认为，全国各地伟大的建设性劳动的主题是苏联儿童文学最重要的题材之一。儿童文学的作家们应该不倦地寻找他们的主人公，向儿童们显示社会主义社会的光辉人物的崇高品质。
    接着，阿塞拜疆诗人和翻译家萨·伏尔根作了关于苏联的诗歌的报告。
    伏尔根在报告中说，苏联诗歌是一个统一的多民族的大合唱，它表示苏联各自由民族兄弟般的友爱，和对社会主义祖国的歌颂。苏联诗人也歌唱世界各民族间的友谊，歌唱无产阶级国际主义的渗透一切的力量。他们为国内的和全世界最好和最光明的事情而欢呼。苏联的诗歌不承认世界人民之间有任何壁障，它反映着一切激动人心的事物。
    伏尔根在谈到苏联诗歌的任务时说，诗人的全部思想应该集中在作为新历史的创造者的社会主义新人的光辉形象上。我们需要大胆的诗的想像，和能够看到我们壮丽的现实和辉煌的明天的广阔视野。
    在十六日晚间会议上，康·西蒙诺夫作了关于苏联散文的补充报告。他首先分期回顾了一下苏联散文二十年来的发展，和每个时期发展的特征。接着，他谈到了社会主义现实主义创作方法的实质，和现代作家在实际工作中对它的正确了解和应用。他说，社会主义现实主义的道路，是为人民服务的文学的唯一正确和有效的道路。在人民已经取得了胜利的地方，社会主义现实主义已经发展成为文学创作的基本方法。根据社会主义现实主义的原则进行创作的苏维埃作家，注意着人民间的一切事情，热爱那些鼓舞人民展望未来的事情。他们不忽视卑鄙的事情，但是，他们认为只有高尚的思想才是人类的本性。他们了解人们的弱点，但是热望培养人们道德上的坚强性。战后流传的声名狼藉的“无冲突论”正在受到猛烈的攻击。
    西蒙诺夫的报告中有很大一部分谈到了提高作家创作技巧的问题。他说，虽然在过去二十年中，我们散文的质量一般已有显著提高，但是整个文学的发展和苏联读者的日益严格的要求已经使得提高质量，特别是提高散文质量的斗争在现在变得非常尖锐了。西蒙诺夫着重指出有必要在苏联创造一种十分重视作家技巧的空气。
    到会者还听取了列·尼古林代表资格审查委员会所作的报告。他说，参加这次代表大会的代表共七百三十八名，其中六百二十六名有表决权，一百一十二名有发言权。自从第一次全苏作家代表大会以来，苏联作家协会会员的数量和成分都有了改变。现在共有会员三千六百九十五名，人数增加了一倍半以上。
