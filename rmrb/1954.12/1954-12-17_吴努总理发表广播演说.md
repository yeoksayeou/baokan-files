    Premier U Nu Delivers Radio Address

    [Xinhua News Agency, December 16th] Prior to his departure from Beijing to return to his country, Burmese Union Prime Minister U Nu delivered a radio address on December 10th. A recording of the speech was broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station on December 16th. The full text is as follows:

    I accepted Premier Zhou Enlai's gracious invitation to come to this great country eleven days ago. During this time, I visited Guangzhou, Hankou, Beijing, Shenyang, Changchun, Anshan, and Dalian.

    Everywhere I and my colleagues went, we were received with warm hospitality by the leaders and the Chinese people, as if we were their own relatives. We were moved by the kindness and enthusiasm everywhere, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people, from the leaders down to the masses.

    The enthusiasm shown to us is not difficult to understand. Since ancient times, the Chinese and Burmese peoples have had very close social and cultural ties. Racially, we are also of the same origin. In addition, both of our countries have established policies of peace. These facts explain the enthusiasm shown to us throughout China.

    I have seen the following three significant characteristics in New China:

    First, I have seen a great transformation that is not only superficial but also quite profound. In the past, the people had no right to manage their own affairs; everything was ordered from above, and what was done rarely benefited the masses. The people were not only exploited by their so-called national leaders but also by foreign imperialists. In those days, the millions of people in this great country, as a Burmese saying goes, were like "frogs under a log," unable to move or express their dissatisfaction.

    Now the situation has changed. The Chinese people are fully aware of their new responsibilities and are building their future. The traditional exploiting classes and foreign imperialists have been driven out, and they can no longer set foot on this land. Everywhere I have seen the Chinese people fulfilling their responsibilities in a spirit of freedom.

    The second important characteristic I have seen is the firm determination of the Chinese people. Every time I visited a place, I talked with leaders and workers, and I felt that the Chinese people were carrying out the tasks assigned to them with enthusiasm and determination.

    Obviously, they are determined not to give up this new order, which is their rightful property, which they earned five years ago with blood, sweat, and enthusiasm. They are motivated by a strong spirit of service, in order not to let their great country fall back into the previous situation and suffer all the resulting disadvantages. They are also determined to resolutely defend this new order at all costs. I have no doubt that they will never allow their country to return to a situation where one class can exploit another. This is the second prominent characteristic of the New China that I have seen.

    The third important characteristic is the obvious consolidation process, developing from a fluid and uncertain situation to one with a solid foundation. In simple terms, New China is developing into a strong and stable country.

    This consolidation process is very evident in agriculture, the national economy, education, culture, and other activities. Unlike the past situation of division and strife, today's New China has achieved unprecedented unity.

    I am confident that this great country will successfully build a new society, because everywhere I see the Chinese people, under the guidance of their trusted and morally upright leaders, genuinely and enthusiastically taking on new tasks.

    I believe that the plans currently being adopted by this country are very much in line with the country's situation. Similarly, the plans we have adopted in Burma are perfectly suited to our country's situation. There is a Burmese saying: "Every temple has its own special mantra, every village has its own favorite song." What is important is that the plans adopted meet the needs of that country.

    Personally, I feel that this transformation, this determination, and this consolidation process are the three prominent characteristics of New China. I wish the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and his wise colleagues, can build a New China in the shortest possible time.

    吴努总理发表广播演说
    【新华社十六日讯】缅甸联邦总理吴努离北京返国前在十二月十日发表广播演说，讲词录音已由中央人民广播电台在十六日播送，全文如下：
    我接受周恩来总理的盛意邀请来到这个伟大的国家已经十一天了。在这个时期中，我访问了广州、汉口、北京、沈阳、长春、鞍山和大连。
    我和我的同事们每到一个地方都受到领导人员和中国人民像款待自己的亲人一样的热烈款待。我们在到处都被盛意和热情所感动，我愿意借这个机会向中国人民，从领导人员直到群众，表示我的衷心感谢。
    向我们表示的这种热情是不难理解的。自古以来，中国和缅甸人民有着极密切的社会和文化的联系，就在种族上，我们也是同出一宗的。除此以外，我们两国都确立了和平政策。这些事实都说明了在中国各地对我们表示的热情。
    我在新中国看到以下三个显著的特点：
    首先，我看到了一个不仅是表面上的而且是颇为深刻的伟大转变。过去人民无权管理自己的事务，任何事情都是从上命令的，而所作的事又很少有益于群众。人民不但受到他们的所谓民族领袖们的剥削，也受到外国帝国主义者的剥削。在那些日子里，这个伟大国家的千百万人民，如缅甸一句俗语所说的，就像是“压在木头底下的青蛙”一样，他们不能动，也不能表示不满。
    现在情况已有改变。中国人民充分地意识到了他们的新的责任，正在建设着他们的将来。传统的剥削阶级和外国帝国主义者已经被赶走，他们不可能再踏上这块土地了。我在到处都看到中国人民在以自由的精神履行他们的责任。
    我所看到的第二个重要特点是中国人民的坚强决心。我每到一地访问，都曾经与领导人员和工人们谈过话，我感觉到中国人民都怀着热情和决心来执行交给他们的任务。
    很明显的，他们是决心不放弃这种新秩序的，这是他们应享的财产，这是他们五年以前用血汗和热情换取来的财产。他们为强烈的服务精神所激励，为了不让他们的伟大国家再堕入从前的情况中去而遭到由此产生的种种坏处。他们也下定决心要不惜任何代价坚决保卫这个新秩序。我毫不怀疑，他们决不会让他们的国家退回到可能使一个阶级可以对另一阶级进行剥削的情况。这是我所看到的新中国的第二个显著特点。
    第三个重要特点是从流动不定的情况发展到有了稳固基础的明显的巩固过程，用简单的话说，就是新中国正在发展成为一个强大和稳固的国家。
    从农业、国民经济、教育、文化和其他各种活动中，都可以非常明显地看出这一个巩固过程。不像过去分裂和纷争的情况，今天的新中国所达到的是空前的团结。
    我确信这个伟大的国家将会胜利地建立一个新社会，因为在各处我都看到中国人民在他们所信任的、有崇高道德的领袖们指导之下，真正热心地担负起新的任务。
    我相信这个国家现在所采取的计划十分符合于这个国家的状况。同样，我们缅甸所采取的计划也完全符合我们国家的状况。缅甸有一句俗语说：“每一个寺院有它自己特殊的咒文，每一个乡村都有它自己所喜爱的歌曲。”重要的是所采取的计划要能满足那个国家的需要。
    我自己觉得，这个转变，这种决心和这一巩固过程是新中国的三个显著的特点。我祝中国人民在毛泽东主席和他的英明的同事们的领导之下，能够在最短期间内建成新中国。
