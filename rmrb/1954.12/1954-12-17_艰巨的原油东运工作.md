    The Arduous Task of Transporting Crude Oil Eastward
    Zhang Fuzhen, Deputy Director of the Yumen Mining Bureau

  To meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction, the Yumen Oil Mine began transporting crude oil eastward in November of last year, according to a decision by the Ministry of Fuel Industries, shipping crude oil produced by the Yumen Oil Mine to refineries in Northeast and East China for refining into various petroleum products. This is a major event in the history of China's petroleum industry.

    The petroleum industry in old China developed abnormally under the semi-colonial system. Several refineries were located in coastal cities far from China's oil-producing areas, and the crude oil supply was entirely dependent on imperialism. Once the crude oil supply was interrupted, the refineries would have to shut down. After liberation, China's natural petroleum production capacity has developed rapidly, but large refineries could not be built in the oil-producing areas for the time being. Therefore, it was necessary to adopt long-distance transportation methods to transport crude oil eastward, using the existing refinery equipment on China's coast to refine a portion of petroleum for the needs of national construction and people's lives, saving the country a sum of foreign exchange spent on oil imports.

    The work of transporting crude oil eastward includes two major aspects: railway and highway combined transportation. Highway transportation is the key to our current work of transporting crude oil eastward.

    We have achieved great success in the year of transporting crude oil eastward. We have established a strong transportation team, mastered the driving technology and maintenance knowledge of various types of diesel vehicles that we were previously unfamiliar with, and transported tens of thousands of tons of crude oil (as well as gasoline, kerosene, and other petroleum products) from the Gobi Desert to railway lines leading to all parts of the country.

    The work of transporting crude oil eastward is a completely new task. Most of the management and drivers are commanders and soldiers who have just been transferred from the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Although they are full of high enthusiasm for building the motherland, they do not understand the technology, and everything must be learned from scratch. To train vehicle drivers, we ran two training courses in succession during the preparation stage. The task was urgent, and the learning time for each phase was only two months; the training vehicles were insufficient, and each person only obtained an average of 31 hours of gasoline vehicle practice operation opportunities. However, thanks to everyone's hard work, the results were very good, and more than 98% of the people passed the exam and obtained driver's licenses from the transportation department.

    These lovely soldiers carried forward the traditional heroic and tenacious fighting spirit and perseverance of the People's Army, overcame numerous difficulties, and completed the plan for transporting crude oil eastward.

    Based on the experts' suggestions, we have formulated diesel vehicle safety operation regulations as the main content of technical education among drivers. We have also turned the work of implementing safety operation regulations and thoroughly correcting irregular operations into a mass movement of mutual supervision and mutual inspection, and used methods such as criticism and rewards to implement safety operation regulations. Through this movement, all personnel have been educated, and three advanced squadrons and eleven advanced detachments have emerged. Now, more than 95% of the drivers have learned and strictly implemented the standard operating procedures. We have also established diesel vehicle maintenance yards according to experts' suggestions, divided the scope of maintenance, specifically stipulated the system of performing maintenance once for each vehicle round trip, and strictly inspected the quality. In order to improve the driving and maintenance skills of drivers and maintenance yard workers, we have held short-term rotating training classes, using methods such as physical object teaching to conduct business training, which has achieved good results. Those who were originally unfamiliar with the structure of vehicle parts, and even did not know which parts to grease and which screws to tighten, now understand and can actually operate; those who originally neglected vehicle maintenance now pay attention to it, and the drivers are more careful in vehicle maintenance. They often clean the vehicles spotlessly. Some drivers even drove the vehicles to the pool in cold weather and stood in the water for a long time to scrub the vehicles. In addition, we have also held several phases of safety education training classes to strengthen the education of safety ideology. All of these efforts have made our vehicle operation rate rise month by month, and we can overfulfill the work plan. The number of accidents has decreased month by month.

    Last winter, because the preparation work for antifreeze and heat preservation was not done well, the diesel fuel in the fuel tank and oil pipes often froze, and the crude oil in the oil tank froze. Every morning, the vehicles could not be started, and they had to be dragged one by one after being heated with fire, which greatly affected the driving time. After the crude oil in the crude oil tank froze, it could not be unloaded. We lacked experience in handling it, and once adopted the method of injecting steam to thaw it, resulting in the volatilization of gasoline contained in the crude oil along with the steam, and the phenomenon that gasoline could not be extracted after the crude oil arrived at the refinery, which was a great loss. This year, we have built some car warming rooms in advance at each station, and the mine also supplies a portion of diesel fuel that is more resistant to freezing, which can reduce the freezing of the vehicle's fuel tank and facilitate the towing of the vehicle for starting, which can greatly save starting time. We have installed antifreeze covers on all crude oil tanks to avoid crude oil freezing. We also realize that we must continue to strengthen the organization and management of crude oil transportation, which is one of the fundamental problems for us to do a good job in transporting crude oil eastward. The characteristics of crude oil transportation work are that the transportation line is long, and it is not as concentrated and easy to manage as a factory. In the past, we did not grasp this key point, and there were more accidents when driving alone. In view of this situation, we have strengthened the entire team driving and fully implemented the system of establishing four cadres for technology, safety, life, and political work in the detachment in order to strengthen technical management and safety supervision during driving, give play to collective wisdom and mutual assistance, and quickly solve the problem of vehicle breakdown midway. This plays a fundamental guarantee role in completing the task of transporting crude oil eastward.

    All the staff and workers who are responsible for the work of transporting crude oil eastward deeply realize that the task we are undertaking is glorious and arduous. With the rapid development of the country's first oil base and the emergence of new oil bases in the future, we will surely be brought more arduous transportation tasks. In order to better build the country's first oil base, in order to closely cooperate with the production of fraternal factories and mines, and in order to realize socialist industrialization, we must do a good job in transporting crude oil eastward, and we will certainly be able to do a good job in transporting crude oil eastward.

    艰巨的原油东运工作
    玉门矿务局副局长　张复振
  为适应祖国大规模经济建设的需要，根据燃料工业部的决定，玉门油矿从去年十一月起，开始了原油东运工作，把玉门油矿生产的原油，输送到东北、华东等地的炼油厂，炼制各种石油产品。这是我国石油工业史上的一件大事。
    旧中国的石油工业，是在半殖民地制度下畸形发展起来的，几个炼油厂都设在距我国石油产地极远的沿海城市，原油供应全部依赖帝国主义，一旦原油中断，炼厂就要停炉。解放以后，我国天然石油的生产能力得到飞跃的发展，而在石油产地又一时不能建好巨大的炼油厂。这就不得不采取长途运输的办法，将原油东运，利用我国沿海的原有炼油厂的设备，为国家建设和人民生活的需要炼出一部分石油，替国家节省一笔因石油进口而付出的外汇。
    原油东运工作包括铁路和公路联合运输的两大方面。公路运输是我们当前作好原油东运工作的关键。
    我们在一年的原油东运工作中获得了很大成绩。建立了强大的运输队伍，掌握了原为我们所十分生疏的各种类型的柴油车驾驶技术和养护知识，把若干万吨的原油（还有汽油、煤油等石油产品），从戈壁滩上运送到通往全国各地的铁路线上。
    原油东运工作是一件全新的工作。管理和驾驶人员大部分是中国人民解放军初转业的指挥员和战士，他们虽然满怀着建设祖国的高度热忱，但是却不懂技术，一切都要从头学起。为培养车辆驾驶人员，我们在准备阶段内接连开办了两期训练班。任务是紧迫的，每期学习时间只有两个多月；教练车辆是不足的，每人平均只获得了三十一小时的汽油车实习操作机会。但由于大家的努力学习，成绩很好，有百分之九十八以上的人考试及格，取得了交通部门的驾驶执照。
    这些可爱的战士发扬了人民军队传统的英勇、顽强的战斗精神和毅力，克服了重重艰难困苦，完成了原油东运的计划。
    我们根据专家的建议，制定了柴油车安全操作规程，作为在驾驶人员中开展技术教育的主要内容。我们并把贯彻安全操作规程、彻底纠正不正规操作的工作，变成了一个群众性的相互监督、相互检查的运动，并运用批评、奖励等办法，来贯彻安全操作规程。经过这一运动，教育了全体人员，并出现了三个先进中队，十一个先进分队。现在已有百分之九十五以上的司机，学会了并严格执行着正规的操作规程。我们又按照专家建议，设立了柴油车保养场，划分了保养范围，具体规定了每车往返一次进行一次保养的制度，并严格地检查质量。为了提高司机和保养场工人的驾驶、保养技术，我们举办了短期轮流训练班，采用实物教学等方法，进行业务训练，获得了良好的效果。使原来不熟悉车辆机件构造，甚至连哪些机件要打黄油、哪些螺丝要扭紧的保养常识都不知道的人，现在都已懂得并且能够实际操作了；原来忽视车辆保养的现在重视了，司机对车辆保养工作更仔细了，他们经常把车子收拾得干干净净。有的司机在寒冷的天气里还把车子开到水池边，长时间站在水里擦洗车子。此外我们并举办了几期安全教育的轮训班，加强安全思想的教育。这一切的努力使我们的车辆运转率逐月上升，并能超额完成作业计划。事故情况逐月减少。
    去年冬天，因为防冻保温准备工作做得不好，常常造成油箱、油管内柴油冻结和油罐原油冻结现象。每天早晨，车子总是发动不了，要拿火烤后一一拖动，影响行驶时间很大，原油罐内的原油冻结后，无法卸车，我们缺乏处理经验，曾一度采用注入蒸汽的办法来解冻，结果造成原油内所含汽油随汽挥发，原油到炼厂后提炼不出汽油的现象，这是很大的损失。今年我们已经预先在各站建设了部分暖车房，同时矿上还供应一部分比较耐冻的柴油，这就可以减少车子油箱冻结和便于拖车发动，能够大大节省发动时间。在原油油罐上我们已全部安装了防冻套，避免原油冻结。我们也认识到：必须继续加强原油运输的组织管理工作，这是我们作好原油东运工作的根本问题之一。原油运输工作的特点，是运输线长、不像工厂那样生产集中便于掌管。已往未抓住这一关键，单车行驶，肇事较多。根据这种情况，我们强调整队行驶、并全面推行分队设立技术、安全、生活、政治工作四干事的制度，以便加强行驶途中的技术管理和安全监督工作，发挥集体智慧和互助精神、迅速解决车辆中途抛锚问题，这对于完成原油东运任务，是起着基本保证作用的。
    我们担负原油东运工作的全体职工，深深地认识到我们所担负的任务是光荣的也是很艰巨的，随着祖国第一个石油基地的迅速发展和今后新的石油基地的出现，必定给我们带来更加繁重的运输任务，为了更好地建设祖国第一个石油基地，为了密切配合兄弟厂矿的生产，为了实现社会主义工业化，我们一定要做好原油东运工作，我们也一定能够做好原油东运工作。
