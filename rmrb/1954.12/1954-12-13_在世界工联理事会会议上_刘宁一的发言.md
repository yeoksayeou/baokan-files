Comrades,

Comrade Saillant's report points out that in the past year, the international workers' movement has made significant progress under extremely complex conditions. The resolutions of the Third World Trade Union Congress have gained increasing sympathy and support from the broad masses of workers and trade union organizations. Striving for peace, democracy, national independence, and improved living standards has become the common banner of the vast majority of people. The unification movement has become a powerful weapon in the struggle of the broad masses of workers. Under this clear banner, the working classes of all countries, who have increasingly mastered this weapon, have formed or are forming an irresistible force marching towards victory.

In this year, through the struggle of the working classes and peoples of all countries, the eight-year-long war in Indochina was finally extinguished after the Korean armistice. The "European Defense Community" plan for a European army suffered a defeat. The Soviet government's lofty will and unswerving spirit in establishing a European collective security system have given great encouragement to all peace-loving countries and the people of the world.

The peaceful coexistence of countries with different systems and the settlement of international disputes through peaceful consultation have become the common belief of hundreds of millions of people. The Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, as proposed in the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese joint statements, have rapidly penetrated the hearts of people in various countries. The "policy of strength" and war preparation measures vigorously advocated by the U.S. warmongering group have been sharply condemned by the people of all countries in the world. The voices and actions of the working classes of all countries demanding unity and solidarity to jointly defend their vital rights and interests have been growing stronger. The Chinese trade unions are delighted and encouraged by the development of these movements to safeguard the common interests of the international working class and the people of the world, and take this opportunity to extend warm congratulations and respect to the worker brothers and trade union workers of all countries!

In the common cause of defending world peace, the World Federation of Trade Unions has launched many powerful movements in the past year. Last year, the World Federation of Trade Unions organized the "Day of International Active Support for the Vietnamese People and Struggle to Stop the Colonial War in Vietnam," and this year it organized the "All-European Trade Union Conference" to oppose the European army plan, etc. These movements have produced good results, thereby further expanding the influence and prestige of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

These achievements show that the resolutions of the Third World Trade Union Congress represent the will of the working class of the world, and also show that as long as the working classes and peace-loving people of all countries unite widely, their victory is guaranteed.

In order to ensure that the large monopoly capitalist groups obtain the highest profits, the U.S.-led aggressive bloc creates international tension, actively expands its arms race, intensifies its oppression and exploitation of the working people of all countries, and deepens their poverty, suffering, and the disaster of death. They have imposed various anti-labor laws on the working class, implemented the most barbaric suppression and massacres, and at the same time, carried out deceptive propaganda, undermined strikes, and divided solidarity. They spread rumors and slanders against the banner of international worker solidarity—the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The U.S. warmongering group and its followers are clearly unwilling to see the international tension ease. In Asia, the United States still occupies our territory of Taiwan and intensifies its support for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to carry out harassing and destructive wars against our mainland, and conducts piratical attacks and robberies against merchant ships of various countries on the Chinese coast and high seas. The United States is stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism, testing hydrogen bombs in the Pacific, and instigating the Syngman Rhee clique to clamor for "Northward Expedition." They are also plotting to undermine the Geneva Accords on the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue. In Manila, they cobbled together a "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" group aimed at destroying the freedom and rights of the Asian people. Recently, the United States signed a "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang bandit gang and planned to organize a "Northeast Asia Defense Alliance" to actively prepare for a war against Asian countries and people.

After the failure of the "European Defense Community" plan for a European army, the U.S. warmongering group and its followers signed the London and Paris Accords under another guise, stepping up the rearmament of West Germany and undermining peace in Europe and the world.

The working classes and peoples of all countries in the world must heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and work together to defeat the war plans of the U.S. warmongering group, to defend national independence and the interests of the working class, and to enable mankind to obtain lasting peace and tranquility.

The recent Moscow Conference of European countries thoroughly exposed the war conspiracies of the U.S. warmongering group and its British and French followers. Once the London and Paris Accords are implemented, West German militarism will be rapidly revived, and the division of Germany and Europe will be further deepened. This will inevitably cause fatal damage to the interests of European countries, especially France. The German people will once again be driven by militarist forces as cannon fodder, and there will be a danger of causing a devastating atomic war in Europe. The European countries' conference not only reaffirmed the determination and desire of the participating countries to actively engage in peaceful construction and maintain and develop friendly relations with the people of all other countries, but also further demonstrated their firm defense of the security and peaceful life of their own countries. The determination and strength to guarantee universal European security and establish a European collective security system provide powerful support and encouragement to the people of European countries, especially the people of France and Germany. European worker brothers will never forget the fascist gallows and killing fields of the past, and will never forget the displacement, disability, and death of family members and relatives. They will no longer want to see the bombing of fascist artillery fire. They will carry out more heroic and tenacious struggles to defeat the London and Paris Accords, oppose the revival of West German militarism, and resolutely realize the European collective security system.

In view of the painful experience of the past two world wars, the Chinese people deeply know that if a European war breaks out, it will inevitably spread to Asia and the world. Therefore, we firmly stand with the people of Europe to oppose the arming of West Germany and the revival of Japanese militarism.

The Chinese working class and people must liberate their sacred territory of Taiwan and will never allow the United States to occupy Chinese territory, infringe upon Chinese sovereignty, and interfere in Chinese internal affairs, and will not allow the United States and the Chiang bandit gang to occupy Taiwan and use Taiwan as a base for disrupting peace in Asia and the Far East. All arguments about establishing an "independent Taiwan," making Taiwan "neutral," and handing Taiwan over to "trusteeship" essentially mean dividing Chinese territory, infringing upon Chinese sovereignty, and interfering in Chinese internal affairs. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. The United States is far across the ocean and occupies China's territory of Taiwan without any reason. The Chinese people love peace, but if anyone wants to fight against the Chinese people, the Chinese people will resolutely strike back against the interferer and provocateur.

The working classes and peoples of China and Asian countries firmly advocate peaceful coexistence, oppose the evil conspiracy of the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, and oppose the United States' creation of hostility and division in Asia and Europe, the establishment of military bases, and the promotion of colonialism.

We demand strict adherence to and implementation of the Geneva Accords on the peaceful settlement of the Indochina issue, and demand the rapid resumption of negotiations on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue with the participation of neutral countries, and the peaceful reunification of Korea according to the wishes of the Korean people.

We firmly believe that the worker brothers and people of all countries will unite more closely, more confidently, and more resolutely to strive for the establishment of a collective security in Asia and Europe, and carry out the just struggle for winning and defending world peace to the end.

The Chinese working class and people, who are firmly implementing a policy of peace, are developing their national economy, carrying out socialist construction, improving their material and cultural lives, and striving to enhance friendly solidarity with the working classes and trade unions of all countries.

The encouragement and assistance given to us by international friends, especially the great assistance given to our construction cause by the Soviet people, has greatly accelerated the progress of our socialist construction. The recent joint communiqué issued by the Chinese and Soviet governments once again vividly marked the development of the incomparably profound great friendship between China and the Soviet Union. The Chinese people express their deep gratitude to the Soviet government and people for the large-scale, comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance given to our country.

Under the leadership of the working class, the first session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, which was held in Beijing in September this year, passed the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which has powerfully promoted the development of our country's socialist industrialization.

The Chinese people are carrying out peaceful construction for their own happiness. Our national economy has made considerable progress, the material and cultural life of the people has been greatly improved, and labor insurance and various welfare benefits are gradually increasing.

At present, the Chinese trade unions are giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and technicians to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state production plan, so as to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the people.

For the happiness of our people and for the defense of lasting world peace, the unity and friendship between our country's trade unions and the working classes of all countries is developing rapidly.

Foreign trade union friends who have been invited to visit our country have praised our people's construction achievements in a short period of five years, the rapid improvement of the material and cultural life of the working people, and the sincerity of our country's working class and the people of the whole country in loving peace and their determination to strive for and defend peace. We are well aware that we still have many difficulties and many shortcomings in our work. We believe that the on-the-spot visit of international friends to our country is a review of our work. They not only encourage us to increase our confidence, but also help us discover and overcome shortcomings, and urge us to do our work better.

The Chinese trade unions have always advocated establishing and developing friendly relations with trade unions of other countries on the basis of equality, voluntariness, and mutual respect.

In the past few years, the Chinese trade unions have participated in various international workers' conferences, conducted correspondence and exchanges of publications with trade unions of various countries, and exchanged delegations to enhance mutual understanding, mutual trust, friendship, and solidarity between our country's trade unions and trade union organizations of other countries, which has also helped to unite different trade unions in various countries.

This year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions invited more than 200 trade union representatives from more than 20 countries including the Soviet Union, people's democracies, India, Japan, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, Britain, France, Italy, Cyprus, and Israel to visit China around the "May 1st" International Labor Day and the "October 1st" National Day, including many representatives of important trade union organizations in Asian countries who are not members of the World Federation of Trade Unions. These representatives have various different political views and religious beliefs, but after direct contact, conversation, and visits, everyone found that there are many common wishes and demands between each other in defending peace, striving for and defending national independence, striving for and defending trade union rights, improving workers' lives, and developing equal and mutually beneficial trade, and established and developed mutual friendship. We believe that as long as there is mutual respect, goodwill, and friendship, different trade unions in various countries can cooperate and unite with each other.

The "Asian Trade Union Friendship Symposium" was held in Beijing in May this year. This symposium was jointly initiated by the trade unions and their leaders of Asian countries and was convened in accordance with the principles of equality, voluntariness, mutual respect, friendship, and consultation. Representatives from 17 trade unions in 9 Asian countries participated in this symposium. Their political views and religious beliefs are different, but this does not prevent the representatives from enthusiastically discussing the major issues facing the working classes of Asian countries. They unanimously passed a communiqué, expressing their common wishes and demands. The representatives attending the meeting unanimously felt that such a symposium would help enhance mutual understanding and friendly solidarity between the trade unions of Asian countries, and hoped that there would be opportunities to hold similar meetings in the future. The Japanese workers' delegation, mainly composed of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, which came to our country to visit during the National Day this year, once said: "We should all devote ourselves to the unity of all Asian workers. Let us all work hard so that representatives of workers from all over Asia can gather together as soon as possible."

The Third World Trade Union Congress correctly pointed out: "The idea of unity is increasingly being grasped by the masses. The working people are increasingly eager to establish trade union solidarity on the enterprise, national, and international levels. The restoration of international trade union solidarity will be of great significance. This unity will further ease international tensions and stop the arms race. This unity will have a positive impact on the development of economic and cultural friendly ties between countries with different social systems. This unity will help increase peaceful production, reduce unemployment, and improve the welfare of the people."

This truth has been understood and supported by more and more workers and trade union workers. The Chinese trade unions will continue to follow this guiding principle of unity, strive to strengthen friendly cooperation with the working classes and trade unions of all countries, so as to defend lasting peace in Asia and the world.

Workers of the world, for the vital interests of our working class, for national independence, democratic freedom, for the happiness of the broad masses of people, and for the bright future of mankind, let us further strengthen our unified action! At this critical moment of peace and war, light and darkness, let us unite more closely like a family, regardless of skin color, race, religious belief, or political views!

### 在世界工联理事会会议上  刘宁一的发言

专栏：

    在世界工联理事会会议上
    刘宁一的发言亲爱的同志们：
    赛扬同志的报告指出了在过去一年中国际工人运动在极其复杂的条件下有了重要的进展。世界工会第三次代表大会的各项决议已经获得越来越多的工人群众和工会组织的同情和支持。争取和平民主、民族独立和生活改善，已成为广大人民共同奋斗的旗帜。统一运动已经成为广大工人群众斗争的有力的武器。在这一鲜明旗帜下，日益掌握了这个武器的各国工人阶级，已经或正在形成一个走向胜利的不可抗拒的力量。
    在这一年中，经过各国工人阶级和人民的奋斗，历时八年的印度支那战火继朝鲜停战之后也终于被扑灭了。“欧洲防务集团”的欧洲军计划遭到了失败。苏联政府对建立欧洲集体安全体系所表现的崇高的意志和坚韧不拔的精神，给予了一切爱好和平的国家和全世界的人民以极大的鼓舞。
    不同制度的国家可以和平共处，国际争端可以通过和平协商来求得解决，已成为亿万人民的共同信念。中印、中缅联合声明所提出的互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则，已迅速深入各国人心。美国好战集团所竭力鼓吹的“实力政策”和准备战争的措施已遭到全世界各国人民尖锐的谴责。世界各国工人阶级要求统一团结、共同捍卫他们的切身权利和利益的呼声和行动已经越来越增长了。中国工会对于这些维护国际工人阶级和全世界人民共同利益的运动的发展感到欢欣鼓舞，并借此机会向各国工人兄弟和工会工作者们致以热烈的祝贺和敬意！
    在保卫世界和平的共同事业中，一年来世界工会联合会发动了许多有力的运动。去年，世界工联组织了“为国际积极支援越南人民日和争取停止越南殖民战争斗争日”，今年又组织了“全欧洲工会会议”来反对欧洲军计划等等运动。这些运动已产生了良好的效果，从而更扩大了世界工会联合会的影响和威信。
    这些成就说明了世界工会第三次代表大会的决议是代表了全世界工人阶级的意志的，也说明了只要各国工人阶级和爱好和平的人民广泛团结，他们的胜利是有保证的。
    以美国为首的侵略集团为了保证大垄断资本家集团获得最高利润，制造国际紧张局势，积极扩军备战，更加紧对于各国劳动人民的压迫和剥削，加深他们的穷困疾苦和死亡的灾难。他们对于工人阶级施用了各种反劳工法令，实行最野蛮的镇压和屠杀。同时，进行欺骗宣传，破坏罢工，分裂团结，对于国际工人团结的旗帜——世界工会联合会进行造谣诬蔑。
    美国好战集团及其追随者显然不愿意看到国际紧张局势趋向缓和。在亚洲，美国依然侵占着我国领土台湾，并加紧支持蒋介石匪帮对我国大陆进行骚扰性和破坏性的战争，在中国沿海和公海上对各国商船进行了海盗式的袭击和抢劫。美国正加紧复活日本军国主义，在太平洋试验氢弹，并唆使李承晚集团拼命叫嚣“北伐”。他们更阴谋破坏日内瓦会议关于和平解决印度支那问题的协议。在马尼拉拼凑了一个旨在摧残亚洲人民的自由权利的“东南亚集体防务条约”集团。最近美国又和蒋匪帮签订了“共同防御条约”，并策划组织“东北亚防御联盟”，以积极准备反对亚洲国家和人民的战争。
    在“欧洲防务集团”的欧洲军计划失败后，美国好战集团及其追随者用另一个幌子签订了伦敦和巴黎协定，加紧重新武装西德，破坏欧洲和世界的和平。
    全世界各国工人阶级和人民必须提高警惕，加强团结，齐心协力地击败美国好战集团的战争计划，以保卫民族独立和工人阶级的利益，使人类能获得持久的和平和安宁。
    最近举行的欧洲国家莫斯科会议彻底地揭露了美国好战集团及其英法追随者的战争阴谋。伦敦和巴黎协定一旦付诸实施，西德军国主义将迅速复活，德国和欧洲的分裂便进一步加深，这就不可避免地要使欧洲国家，首先是法国的利益受到致命的损害，德国人民将再一次被军国主义势力驱使作炮灰，并且将有在欧洲引起一场毁灭性原子战争的危险。欧洲国家会议不仅再一次表明了与会各国积极从事和平建设并同所有其他国家人民保持和发展友好关系的决心和愿望，也更加表明了他们牢固地捍卫着自己国家的安全和和平生活。保障欧洲普遍安全、建立欧洲集体安全体系的决心和力量，给予欧洲各国人民，特别是法国和德国人民以极有力的支持和鼓舞。欧洲工人兄弟们永远不会忘记过去法西斯的绞刑架、杀人场，再也不会忘记家人眷属的流离失所和残废死亡，再也不愿看到法西斯炮火的轰炸。他们必将为击败伦敦和巴黎协定、反对复活西德军国主义、坚决实现欧洲集体安全体系进行更加英勇和坚韧的斗争。
    中国人民鉴于过去两次大战的痛苦经验，深知如果欧洲战争一旦燃起，势必会延烧到亚洲和全世界。所以我们坚决地和欧洲人民站在一起，反对武装西德和复活日本军国主义。
    中国工人阶级和人民一定要解放自己的神圣的领土台湾，决不允许美国侵占中国的领土，侵犯中国的主权和干涉中国的内政，不允许美国和蒋匪帮盘踞在台湾把台湾作为破坏亚洲和远东和平的巢穴。一切关于建立“台湾独立国”、使台湾“中立化”和把台湾交予“托管”的论调，实质上都意味着分割中国的领土，侵犯中国的主权，干涉中国的内政。这是中国人民所绝对不能容许的。美国远隔重洋侵占中国领土台湾，是毫无理由的。中国人民是热爱和平的，但是，如果谁要强同中国人民作战，中国人民就会坚决给予干涉者和挑衅者以回击。
    中国和亚洲各国的工人阶级和人民坚决主张和平共处，反对东南亚侵略集团的罪恶阴谋，反对美国在亚洲和欧洲制造敌对和分裂、建立军事基地和推行殖民主义。
    我们要求严格遵守和贯彻日内瓦会议关于和平解决印度支那问题的协议，要求迅速恢复有中立国参加的和平解决朝鲜问题的谈判，根据朝鲜人民的愿望和平统一朝鲜。
    我们深信各国工人兄弟和人民将会更加团结一致地、更有信心和有决心地为建立亚洲和欧洲的集体安全而努力，把争取和保卫世界和平的正义斗争进行到底。
    坚决贯彻和平政策的中国工人阶级和人民正在发展本国的国民经济，进行社会主义建设，改善自己的物质和文化生活，并且努力增进与各国工人阶级和工会间的友好团结。
    国际朋友们给予我们的鼓励和帮助，特别是苏联人民所给予我们建设事业的巨大帮助，大大地加速了我国社会主义建设的进度。最近中苏两国政府所发表的联合公报，再一次鲜明地标志着中苏两国之间无比深厚的伟大友谊的发展。中国人民对于苏联政府和人民所给予我国的大规模的、全面的、长期的和无私的援助，表示深深的感谢。
    中国人民在工人阶级领导下，今年九月在北京召开的中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，通过了中华人民共和国宪法，有力地促进了我国社会主义工业化事业的发展。
    中国人民为了自己的幸福，进行着和平建设。我国的国民经济已有了长足的发展，人民的物质和文化生活也有了很大的改善，劳动保险事业和各种福利待遇正在逐渐增加。
    目前中国工会正在发挥广大职工群众和技术人员的积极性和创造性，保证完成和争取超额完成国家生产计划，以满足全国人民日益增长的物质和文化需要。
    为了我国人民幸福，为了保卫世界持久和平，我国工会和各国工人阶级的团结友好正在迅速发展。
    应邀来我国参观的外国工会朋友们，对我国人民在短短五年中所获得的建设成就和劳动人民物质文化生活的迅速改善，对我国工人阶级和全国人民热爱和平的诚意和争取和保卫和平的决心，表示赞扬。我们深知我们的困难还是很多，我们工作中还存在着许多缺点。我们认为国际友人到我国实地参观是对我们工作的一种检阅，他们不但鼓励我们以增加我们的信心，同时也帮助我们发现和克服缺点，督促我们把工作作得更好。
    中国工会一贯主张在平等、自愿和相互尊重的基础上同其它各国工会建立和发展友好关系。
    在过去几年中，中国工会参加了各种工人的国际会议，和各国工会进行通讯联络、交换刊物和互派代表团，增进了我国工会和其它国家工会组织的相互了解、相互信任和友谊团结，也有助于各国国内不同工会的团结。
    今年中华全国总工会曾经在“五一”国际劳动节和十月一日我国国庆节前后邀请了苏联、各人民民主国家和印度、日本、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、英国、法国、意大利、塞浦路斯、以色列等二十多个国家二百多位工会代表到中国来观礼和参观，其中包括许多非世界工会联合会会员的亚洲国家的重要工会组织代表。这些代表具有各种不同的政治见解和宗教信仰，但是经过了直接的接触、交谈和参观后，大家发觉彼此之间在保卫和平、争取和保卫民族独立、争取和保卫工会权利、改善工人生活、发展平等互利的贸易等方面存在着许多共同的愿望和要求，并且建立和发展了相互之间的友谊。我们认为只要相互尊重，彼此善意友好，各国不同的工会是能够相互合作和团结的。
      今年五月在北京举行了“亚洲工会友谊座谈会”。这个座谈会是由亚洲各国工会及其领袖所共同倡议，根据平等、自愿、相互尊重、友好、协商的原则召开的。参加这次座谈会的有亚洲九个国家十七个工会的代表，他们的政治见解和宗教信仰是不同的，但这并不妨碍代表们热诚地讨论亚洲各国工人阶级所面临的重大问题。他们一致通过一个公报，表达了他们共同的愿望和要求。参加会议的代表一致感觉到这样的座谈会有助于增进亚洲各国工会之间的相互了解和友好团结，并且希望今后能有机会再举行类似的会议。今年国庆节到我国来参观的以日本工会总评议会为主的日本工人代表团曾经表示：“我们应该都要致力于所有亚洲工人的团结。我们大家都来努力，以便尽早地使全亚洲工人代表欢聚在一堂。”
    世界工会第三次代表大会曾经正确地指出：“团结的思想正日见广泛地掌握着群众。劳动人民日益迫切地希望建立起企业中的、全国和国际规模的工会团结。国际工会团结的恢复将具有非常重大的意义。这种团结将促使国际紧张局势进一步缓和，制止军备竞赛。这种团结将对社会制度不同的国家之间经济和文化友好联系的发展发生良好的影响。这种团结将有助于提高和平生产、减少失业和增进人民的福利。”
    这个真理已为越来越多的工人群众和工会工作者所了解和拥护。中国工会将继续遵循这个团结的方针，努力加强同各国工人阶级和工会的友好合作，以保卫亚洲和全世界的持久和平。
    全世界的工人们，为了我们工人阶级的切身利益，为了民族独立、民主自由，为了广大人民的幸福，为了人类的光明前途，让我们进一步加强我们的统一行动吧！在这个和平和战争、光明和黑暗的关头，让我们不分肤色、种族、宗教信仰、政治主张，有如一个家庭一样更加紧密的团结起来吧！
