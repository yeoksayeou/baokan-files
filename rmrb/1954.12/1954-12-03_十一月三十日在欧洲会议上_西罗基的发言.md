Comrades and friends!

Even while the government of the Czechoslovak Republic was still engaged in preliminary consultations with the Soviet government, it had already expressed sincere welcome and complete support for the new and noble proposal put forward by the Soviet government. The purpose of this proposal is to prevent the danger that threatens the peace-loving peoples of Europe and threatens European peace and world peace, a danger caused by the Western governments' attempt, at all costs, to ratify the one-sided Paris Agreements concluded by the United States with some Western European governments a few weeks ago. Historical experience tells the Czechoslovak people that the interests of every free and peace-loving country require that everyone make every effort to prevent the revival of West German militarism and to drag West Germany into an aggressive bloc composed of some Western countries. Therefore, the Czechoslovak government unconditionally supports the Soviet government's proposal to convene a conference on the establishment of a European collective security system.

Obviously, the governments of some European countries do not understand the seriousness of the danger that threatens all countries without exception. They have succumbed to the pressure of some Western powers and refused to participate in this conference. There is no doubt that if they stubbornly adhere to this policy in the future, it may cause serious harm to their people and pose a threat.

At the same time, those Western countries that are planning the militarization of West Germany and dragging it into an aggressive bloc are not only unwilling to participate in the pan-European conference themselves, but also directly and openly oppress other countries, attempting to obstruct the holding of this conference. In this way, they fully reveal their faces as enemies of European peace and security, and thereby also confirm that they intend to continue to implement the fatally dangerous "policy of strength" in the future, of which the Paris Agreements are a clear manifestation.

Under these circumstances, the task of the peace-loving countries attending this conference to discuss European peace and security issues is particularly serious, and their responsibility is particularly great. Based on the vital interests of the Czechoslovak people and their will, the government of the Czechoslovak Republic has expressed a positive attitude towards the Soviet government's proposal. The Czechoslovak people strongly demand peace and peaceful cooperation among all peoples. They do not allow anyone to undermine their great constructive labor for the further prosperity of their free and beautiful country. Moreover, the Czechoslovak government is fully convinced that its actions are also in line with the wishes of all peoples to maintain and consolidate European peace and world peace, because it recognizes that peace and security are inseparable. The government of the Czechoslovak Republic has consistently pursued a policy of defending peace and advocating peaceful cooperation among countries with different political and social systems. It has opposed the Paris Agreements from the beginning. The Paris Agreements are used to oppose the freedom and independence of the peace-loving peoples, and the Paris Agreements are intended to deepen the danger of a new war in Europe, because the main and direct purpose of this agreement is to re-militarize West Germany and drag it into an aggressive bloc composed of some Western countries.

The fate of the Czechoslovak people, who live in the center of Europe, has always been closely related to the development of Europe. Our country has abundant natural resources, and our people love labor and freedom. Therefore, our country has been a target of German militarists since ancient times. In the uninterrupted struggle to win their own national and national survival, our people have gradually tempered and grown up, and at the same time, they have greatly promoted the victorious spread of progressive ideas of democracy and freedom in Europe. Therefore, the development of European affairs is particularly important to Czechoslovakia.

The Paris Agreements undermine the possibility of resolving the most important European issue – the German issue – which is the key to the further development of the European situation. Since Czechoslovakia is a close neighbor of Germany, it is particularly concerned that the German issue can be resolved in the spirit of peace and friendship among all peoples. In their eventful history, the Czechoslovak people have been repeatedly subjected to aggression by German militarism, which has always been their mortal enemy. The Czechoslovak people have personally experienced the expansion and Germanization ambitions of German militarism in the past. They have always regarded our country as one of the main targets of their "eastward advance" aggression policy. These ambitions of German militarism were supported by the ruling groups of the United States and Western European countries after the First World War, especially after the establishment of the Soviet state. The ruling groups of these countries vainly attempted to turn the spearhead of German militarism's aggression to the East, targeting the Soviet Union. At the same time, they did not hesitate to sacrifice Czechoslovakia, regardless of all the international legal obligations and guarantees they had undertaken towards Czechoslovakia.

As everyone knows, they miscalculated. German militarism turned around and invaded them. As a result, the people of Western European countries paid a high price for the unreasonable and short-sighted policies of their governments. The governments of some Western European countries are now exposing their own people to the same danger. There is no doubt that if West German militarism is revived, they will turn around and attack Western European countries sooner or later. Not only the existing historical experience, but also the current development of the situation in West Germany can prove this point.

The sacrifices brought by the flames of German aggression to the Czechoslovak people were particularly heavy. After the end of the First World War, the German ruling group immediately fostered and incited nationalist sentiments among the German nationalists in Czechoslovakia. As early as when the Locarno Treaty was signed, the German government had already refused in principle to guarantee the borders of Czechoslovakia. As everyone knows, the then German Chancellor Stresemann said after the Locarno Conference: "The West has been guaranteed, and we will regain the East. Future developments will follow this point."

When German militarists came to power in Nazi Germany with the consent and support of Western countries, the threat of German militarism's aggression against Czechoslovakia also deepened. Threats, blackmail, and provocations intensified, and the then surrendering government of Czechoslovakia did not give due resistance to this behavior, thus opening the door for Nazi Germany to occupy Czechoslovakia later. Czechoslovakia became one of the first countries to bear the brunt of the German Nazis and militarists' seizure of world hegemony. The Western reactionary group sacrificed the freedom and independence of Czechoslovakia in the Munich tragedy. This tragedy is a warning to the world, illustrating what the policy of compromise with the aggressor will lead to, and what the result of compromise with German militarism will be. After the Munich tragedy, the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia, which began the most tragic period in our history. The Czechoslovak people paid a heavy price in the struggle to liberate themselves and destroy Hitler's fascism, this unprecedentedly brutal German militarism. November 17, 1939, Lites, Julius Fučík, and the thousands and thousands of heroes who were tortured to death, executed, and sacrificed are not only forever preserved in our memory, but also forever preserved in the memory of all honest people in the world.

Our people have never stopped fighting against German militarism, because they have learned a lesson from the experience gained at a high price. After the Soviet army re-liberated our people in May 1945, our people embarked on the road of people's democracy and chose the road of forming the closest friendship and alliance with the great Soviet Union. Only the Soviet Union, faithful to its obligations as an ally, stood with our people at the critical moments of the Munich conspiracy and March 15, 1939; only the Soviet Union, made such a huge contribution in saving mankind from the disaster of German Nazism and militarism. The Czechoslovak people resolutely and absolutely cannot allow their country to become a victim of German militarist aggression again. The words of President Klement Gottwald, who will always live in our memory, vividly express this firm determination of our people. He said: "The Czechoslovak people are deeply concerned about this struggle. They will never allow their homeland to be ravaged by German aggressors again. They will never allow Brandenburgers, Sigismunds, White Mountain Ferdinands, and Windisch-Graetzes to run rampant in their country again, nor do they want to deal with new Heydrichs again."

Filled with this determination, our people fully support the Potsdam Agreement signed by the great powers. In the Potsdam Agreement, the major powers, which formed a strong anti-fascist alliance during the Second World War, stipulated the purpose of their post-war policy towards Germany. They had guaranteed to completely eliminate German militarism and take effective measures to prevent the revival or reorganization of German militarism. These great powers also guaranteed to eliminate German Nazism, do everything possible to prevent the revival of Nazism, and prevent any form of Nazi and militarist activity or propaganda. At the same time, they guaranteed that their policy towards Germany was to prepare conditions for the transformation of Germany's political life on a democratic basis and for Germany to participate in international peaceful cooperation. At the same time, it must be emphasized that the policy towards Germany stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement is based on the necessary prerequisite that Germany is always a unified country, and the occupying countries should also treat Germany in this way.

Since 1945, Czechoslovakia has made great efforts to seek a solution to the German issue in the spirit of this agreement. Everything that the Czechoslovak government has said and done regarding the German issue proves this.

The Paris Agreements show that the Western countries, especially the United States, are responsible for the fact that Germany is still divided to this day. The Western countries, in the western part of Germany under their control, have embarked on the road of reviving German imperialism, Nazism, and militarism, and thus completely violated the obligations they undertook in Potsdam. Their policy in West Germany, especially the Paris Agreements, is a mockery of those obligations they must fulfill in the Potsdam Declaration, which states: "German militarism and Nazism shall be eradicated, and the Allied countries shall unanimously agree to take other necessary measures, either now or in the future, to ensure that Germany never again threatens its neighbors or world peace."

Only the Soviet Union continues to be faithful to the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement. It is the only country among all occupying countries that has impartially and consistently fulfilled all the obligations it has undertaken. The Soviet Union has truly eliminated Nazism and militarism in eastern Germany and implemented true democratization. Its policy has helped the democratic forces of the German people to consolidate and grow stronger. In this way, it has created conditions for the German people in eastern Germany to establish the first peace-loving and truly democratic country in German history – the German Democratic Republic. The Czechoslovak people have always been good at distinguishing between the peace-loving German working people and the German militarists and monopoly capitalists. Therefore, from the first day of the birth of the German Democratic Republic, the Czechoslovak people have had complete trust and friendly feelings towards it and are willing to cooperate with it. Because the Czechoslovak people see that the German Democratic Republic is the foundation and fortress of all peace-loving and democratic forces in Germany's struggle to make Germany a country worthy of being a member of the European family of peace-loving peoples. Czechoslovakia has established and is developing the most friendly political, economic, and cultural relations with the German Democratic Republic. This relationship is the beginning of a happy new era in the relationship between our people and the German people. Needless to say, this relationship can only be established under the conditions that the German Democratic Republic is born and grows into a truly peaceful and democratic country. There is no doubt that this relationship can also be fully developed with a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. However, the ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements will make it impossible to establish such a unified and democratic Germany for a long time, and it may be the beginning of a new disaster for West Germany. West Germany has been a base for hostile activities against our country for several years.

In West Germany, a group of people are increasingly arrogantly shouting to settle accounts with the Czechoslovak Republic, to annex our territory, and to eliminate our independent and autonomous country.

We hear revanchist demands directly from the official figures of the Bonn ruling group, from Chancellor Adenauer, his ministers, and members of parliament; from the mouths of the commanders and officers of the former Hitler "Wehrmacht" who were appointed in advance as commanders of the West German revanchist army that is being organized. These figures shout about launching a "crusade" against us and our allies, and demand the restoration of the Munich borders. We have once again heard the most familiar terms in the arsenal of Nazi ideology, such as: "German Empire," "European Space," "Germany's Mission in the East," etc. This is exactly the demand we often heard before the Second World War, and the people who said these words are exactly the same people as before. Obviously, revanchism is the political proposition of the Bonn ruling group. This group - the spokesmen and supporters of extreme reactionary revanchism - is the mortal enemy of the German people. The Adenauer group in Bonn is unwilling to unify Germany in a peaceful manner, because they need the division of Germany in order to realize their conspiracy. Therefore, they refuse to take the path of negotiations between representatives of East and West Germany. They do not want peace, they want war, because they hope to seize the whole of Germany by force in the war, and to seize the places occupied by Hitler's Germany during the Second World War. This is also why they insist on implementing the Paris Agreements. However, it is unnecessary to say that everyone knows that the Bonn ruling group's delusional plans, just like Hitler's crazy plans in those years, are far from reality.

These deliberate actions of the West German revanchists and militarists are fully supported by the Western countries, especially the United States, in their policy of reviving militarism.

The US ruling group, taking advantage of its position as an occupying country, has turned West Germany into an outpost base for hostile activities against the countries of the peace camp under the "Common Security" Act. Czechoslovakia occupies a considerable position among the targets of these hostile activities.

US agencies send terrorists, subversives, and spies across our western border, instructing them to carry out terrorist activities, organize traitorous groups, collect espionage intelligence, and distribute provocative leaflets. The organs of our Ministry of Internal Affairs captured a total of 1,200 spies, subversives, and terrorists sent to our country in 1952-1953, which can prove how large-scale this criminal activity is.

At present, border incidents occur frequently on our border, and these incidents are provoked by the troops of a country thousands of kilometers away from our country - the United States. This alone is enough to explain the abnormal situation in Germany today. The poisonous atmosphere of these incidents exacerbates international tensions.

The sabotage and hostile activities against our country from the territory of West Germany have not achieved their purpose. Our people are vigilantly defending the security of our country and will never allow anyone to undermine our republic. Our people condemn and punish espionage and subversive activities with great indignation, and counterattack all the slander and provocation offensives from the West German base and led by the West German base with extreme contempt.

However, regardless of how tragic the consequences of these sabotage and hostile activities from the territory of West Germany are, the activity itself illustrates how a country is extremely arrogantly interfering in the internal affairs of another country, denying and undermining the universally recognized principles of international law, and at the same time seriously violating the obligations undertaken by the Western countries (including the United States) as the occupying countries of Germany.

There is no doubt that if the Paris Agreements, which stipulate the re-militarization of West Germany and drag it into an aggressive bloc, are implemented, the hostile activities against our republic from the territory of West Germany will intensify.

If the Paris Agreements are ratified, the revanchist forces will receive strong encouragement and support, and, with the support of the Western countries, revanchism will become the official policy of militarist West Germany. If the Bonn revanchists' activities are so rampant now, when West Germany does not yet have a regular army, then there is no doubt that once the Bonn revanchists obtain the revived "Wehrmacht," their own weapon, these activities will become even more intense. The establishment of the "Wehrmacht" in West Germany is equivalent to the revanchists grasping the material force necessary for them to realize their aggressive plans in the East and the West.

Obviously, once West Germany becomes a hotbed of war, direct hostile activities against our border will intensify. In addition to the provocations of the US military, the revived "Wehrmacht" will also carry out provocations.

I only need to look back at history to see that the policy of establishing exclusive military blocs against other countries has never produced any other outcome than leading to war. As stipulated in the Paris Agreements, making the re-militarized West Germany participate in an aggressive pact and serve as its core will make this pact more aggressive and will further aggravate the danger of war in Europe.

And this is exactly what the planners of the Paris Agreements need. The Paris Agreements are war agreements; their purpose is to exacerbate tensions, create a source of conflict in Europe, and use the revived West German militarism to launch a new world war. This is the old policy of using aggressive German militarism against the freedom-loving people of Europe, which is despised and hated by the people. The planners of this policy have finally exposed their true colors. World public opinion heard with great indignation the confession made by British Prime Minister Churchill not long ago. He admitted that at the end of the Second World War, he had instructed Marshal Montgomery to carefully collect and preserve the weapons of the German army, so that if the British government ever deemed it necessary to cooperate with German soldiers to jointly oppose the Soviet Union, it would be very convenient to reissue these weapons to German soldiers. This means that when the Soviet army, regardless of sacrifice, was completing its noble liberation mission in the decisive battle against German fascism, when the Soviet army was also shedding blood for the freedom of the British people, the British government was discussing whether it was possible to use the enemy's army against its own ally. Since the British ruling group was prepared to incorporate the military forces of fascist militarism under its banner, it was equivalent to saying that they were also prepared to turn around and adopt the policy pursued by these military forces – namely, the policy of German fascism. This calculation failed to materialize in 1945. Less than a decade later, the Paris Agreements are serving to realize this scheme.

The entire development of the situation in West Germany proves that the militarists in West Germany have not learned any lessons from the defeat in the Second World War. They have not transformed at all. On the contrary, they are becoming increasingly frantically hostile to the freedom-loving countries. It is precisely for this reason that the governments of Western countries are attempting to pull the West German militarists into their military bloc in order to further deepen the aggressive nature of this bloc.

Ratification of the Paris Agreements will pave the way for West German militarist aggression. However, the people of Western European countries recognize the fatal danger that the revival of German militarism and the dragging of German militarism into an aggressive pact can produce. The movement against the revival of German militarism in West Germany is growing stronger. Those who revive militarism have to cover up their true intentions more and more carefully. Therefore, they shamelessly describe the Paris Agreements, which are tools of war, as tools of peace. Therefore, they deceive people by saying that the achievements made in easing international tensions can only be attributed to the "policy of strength," and even say that the ratification of the Paris Agreements can bring new achievements in this regard. It is not difficult to prove that the facts are completely the opposite. The ratification of the Paris Agreements will greatly exacerbate international tensions.

Another equally characteristic justification for aggressive blocs is that the people of peace-loving countries will have to tolerate the re-militarization of West Germany, which has become a "fait accompli," and that they will not take counter-measures to deal with this fact. However, the people of peace-loving countries cannot tolerate the re-militarization of West Germany, because tolerating the re-militarization of West Germany means tolerating war.

The "policy of strength" can only get one answer from the people of freedom-loving countries: a policy backed by greater strength.

In order to contain the opposition of the people of Western European countries, especially the French people (who have already shattered the attempt to realize the re-militarization of West Germany with the help of the "European Defense Community"), the rulers of Western countries insist that this agreement provides some kind of "guarantee" to prevent the danger of German militarist aggression. They want to use this lie to win the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

All the clamor about this so-called "guarantee" is nothing but an obvious trick, aimed at concealing the true purpose of the Paris Agreements from the people of Western European countries, so as to paralyze the vigilance of the people of Western European countries against the revival of the West German "Wehrmacht."

This is the only correct explanation for the following seemingly incomprehensible fact: on the one hand, the aggressive bloc of Western countries stubbornly insists on reviving West German militarism, emphasizing that this step is "necessary," and on the other hand, they talk about the necessity of having some kind of "guarantee" to prevent German militarism.

Based on their own experience, the Czechoslovak people know best how to evaluate this kind of "guarantee" that they have also received in the past to prevent the threat of German militarist aggression.

The treaties of the First World War once stipulated our borders. Czechoslovakia's security should have been guaranteed within the scope of that infamous League of Nations regulations. Its security was guaranteed once again in the Briand-Kellogg Pact, which was also signed by Germany. The Franco-Czech Treaty was also intended as a guarantee for Czechoslovakia against German aggression. However, as everyone knows, when German militarism launched an aggression in 1938, what use were these kinds of "guarantees?" As long as German militarists feel they have enough strength to use force to realize their ambitions to dominate the world, all these "guarantees" will become mere scraps of paper. As for the clauses of the shameful Munich Agreement, they are an outright mockery of the concept of "guarantee" in international relations. These clauses once "guaranteed" the continued existence of a fragmented Czechoslovakia. When the Munich partners of the Western European countries brazenly annexed the remainder of the Czechoslovak Republic in March 1939, those Western European guarantors did not lift a finger.

Our people believe that all the "guarantees" put forward by those who revive German militarism to prevent German militarist aggression are worthless. On the contrary, these "guarantees" only help to conceal the aggressive plans of German militarism. Therefore, the Czechoslovak people are extremely vigilant about all the lies about "guarantees," which the contracting parties of the Paris Agreements intend to use to paralyze the vigilance of the European people, so that they can tolerate the revival of German militarism.

The Paris "guarantee" that guarantees against the danger of revived German militarism is actually not a guarantee at all. The only guarantee that can prevent this danger is not to revive German militarism, but to stop the re-militarization of Germany. This is the only way to protect the security of the European people from the threat of German militarism, which has always been the mortal enemy of the freedom and independence of the European people.

Based on the above reasons, the government of the Czechoslovak Republic is deeply convinced that the only way to solve the European peace and security issues, including the German issue, is to establish a European collective security system in accordance with the proposal of the Soviet government. The Soviet proposal proceeds from the possibility of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and economic systems. It fully complies with all the fundamental principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. Therefore, the proposed collective security system stipulates the real participation of all European countries in this system, and runs through the spirit of constantly respecting the independence and sovereignty of all participating countries, large and small. Within the scope of this system, European countries should undertake the obligation not to use their armed forces for offensive purposes, never to invade each other, and should guarantee each other to participate in collective actions against the threat of armed aggression against Europe. The Soviet proposal also advocates that the participants in this system have the obligation to fully support the development of mutual cooperation in the economic field. The Soviet proposal also advocates including the two parts of Germany in the pan-European security system, in order to establish a unified and democratic Germany in the future, which makes it impossible to create a hotbed of new wars in Europe in West Germany.

Therefore, the Czechoslovak government is deeply convinced that establishing an effective European collective security system in accordance with the Soviet proposal means guaranteeing peace and consolidating the security of all European countries, including our own. Establishing this system would create the preconditions for the reunification of Germany and the establishment of an independent, peace-loving, and democratic Germany. This is of great significance to Czechoslovakia, because in this way, our southwestern border will no longer be a border where conflicts occur and tensions form, but a border where peace and effective cooperation are practiced.

The establishment of a European collective security system will become the basis for us to develop political, economic, and cultural relations extensively and comprehensively with all European countries. The establishment of a collective security system will stop the policy of establishing mutually hostile blocs and the policy of dividing Europe, and can guarantee lasting peace for all European countries that have suffered from these policies in the past.

It goes without saying that in order for the proposition of establishing a European collective security system, which is precious to the people of all European countries, to be realized, the Western countries must completely and permanently stop implementing the harmful policy of re-militarizing West Germany and stop implementing the policy of the Paris Agreements.

The government of the Czechoslovak Republic, fully based on the opinions of all the people of Czechoslovakia, issued a statement on March 24, 1954, welcoming the proposal of the Soviet delegation at the Berlin Conference to establish a European collective security system. The Czechoslovak government stated that the Czechoslovak Republic is ready to participate in the pan-European treaty guaranteeing collective security and will support all efforts made to conclude such a treaty.

The government of the Czechoslovak Republic reiterated this opinion in its statement on the Geneva Conference on July 24, 1954, and in its notes to the governments of France, the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark on September 28, 1954, urgently warning of the danger of the revival of German militarism and revanchism, and called for the necessary measures to peacefully resolve the German issue and establish a European collective security system. All our people welcomed with high enthusiasm the proposal put forward in the Soviet government's note of November 13 to convene a pan-European conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system. The people of the entire Czechoslovak Republic launched a powerful wave of patriotic movement, expressing their resolute condemnation of the Paris Agreements and the policy of reviving militarism.

The meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic on November 16, 1954, after discussing the government statement, unanimously adopted a letter to the members of the parliaments of European countries, calling on them to defend the cause of peace to the end for the interests of their countries and peoples, to refuse to agree to the aggressive Paris Agreements, and calling on them to firmly demand that their governments participate in the conference to discuss the establishment of a European collective security system.

On November 18, the National Front of Czechoslovakia convened a representative conference in Prague Palace. Representatives from all walks of life in Czechoslovakia, representatives of various political parties, mass organizations, churches, factories, agricultural cooperatives, and famous scientists and artists participated in this conference. They issued a "Letter to the People of Europe" as follows:

"At this decisive moment, we warn the countries of Europe: the revival of German militarism has serious dangers. We strive for peace not only for ourselves, but also for the people of Europe, including the German people with whom we hope to live in friendship and harmony.

"We wholeheartedly welcome the Soviet Union's peace proposals. The path that conforms to the vital interests of the people of Europe is not the plan of the planners of the London Agreement and the Paris Agreements to form military blocs of some countries against other countries, but the path of friendly and peaceful coexistence."

In countless gatherings in cities and villages, the entire Czechoslovak people unanimously issued a powerful and resounding voice. In countless declarations and resolutions, our people appealed to the people of Western European countries, especially the French people, hoping that they would rise up more forcefully to crush the plans to revive German militarism. Our people fully support the heroic struggle of the peace warriors in the West with brotherly solidarity. Our people know that in the current stage of the struggle to safeguard peace and prevent the threat of war, the people should express their opinions first.

On November 28, the election of the National Assembly was held - in the election, the Czechoslovak people expressed their complete agreement with the National Front government's position of striving to guarantee the peaceful and happy life of our people, and expressed full trust in this government.

The Czechoslovak people's struggle against the revival of German militarism and for European peace and security shows that the people of our entire country show a firm spiritual and political unity in the issues of peace and homeland security. This unity cannot be shaken by anything or anyone. The Czechoslovak people have shown a high degree of awareness. They recognize their own strength and the strength of the entire powerful peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. No military threat can frighten our people. Our people have all the necessary conditions to defend the freedom and independence of our beloved motherland, and our people will spare no effort to strengthen the defense forces of the motherland.

We have a treaty of alliance with the powerful and invincible Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We are also linked by treaties of alliance with the people's democratic countries of Europe. Standing with us is a peaceful great power with a population of 600 million - the People's Republic of China. And with us are hundreds of millions of peace supporters all over the world.

The only hope of the Czechoslovak people is to build the happy life of our country peacefully in the future. They do not threaten anyone and are willing to coexist peacefully with all countries and carry out effective cooperation. They do not reject anyone who extends a sincere and friendly hand to them. However, no one should doubt that if the Western countries implement their plans to revive West German militarism, the Czechoslovak people will not relax their efforts for a minute to ensure that they are not invaded by others.

The Czechoslovak government is deeply convinced that the development of the world and European situation in recent months provides a realistic possibility for laying the foundation for the peaceful coexistence of European countries, and provides a realistic possibility for solving the German issue in accordance with the interests of peace and the vital interests of the people of European countries, including the German people. There is still time to embark on the road of establishing a peaceful camp of a single European country and the road of collective security. There is still time to complete the basic tasks in the current European and world situation: to reunify Germany into a peaceful and democratic country on the basis of an agreement between the major powers and the governments of the two parts of Germany, on the basis of holding free elections throughout Germany and concluding a peace treaty with Germany. However, this road is only open under the following conditions: the Paris Agreements must not be ratified, the Western countries must abandon the current policy of reviving West German militarism, abandon the policy of establishing an aggressive bloc of Western countries including militarist West Germany, abandon the policy of opposing the freedom and independence of the peace-loving people, the policy of opposing the interests of peace, and abandon the policy of preparing for a new war. There is no third way between these two roads, and there can be no compromise. Either the Western countries will still stubbornly implement the current policy in the future, then they will bear full responsibility for all the consequences. Or they abandon this bellicose policy, then all the conditions are immediately available to solve European and world problems peacefully and through mutual consultation, in accordance with the interests of all countries, including Germany and Western countries.

The Western countries say that they are only prepared to negotiate with the Soviet Union and other democratic countries based on "strength." This means that they want to negotiate under the threat of war and while brandishing swords and guns. They want to use the new West German "Wehrmacht" and the bayonets of the Western aggressive bloc to threaten others to accept their will. They have forgotten that this plan is completely unrealistic today. Under the current balance of power, they are doomed to complete failure. They have forgotten that in the struggle against this bellicose policy, there is a united and powerful camp of democratic countries that is maintaining peace and the freedom and independence of all peoples. Because the people of these countries have unified will and goals, this camp is powerful and invincible. We reiterate seriously that if the Western countries want to deal with us with strength, then our answer is: more unity, more consolidation of our strength.

The Czechoslovak government firmly states that if the Paris Agreements are ratified, it will take all necessary measures according to the situation to guarantee the security of its people and its country.

Given the seriousness of the situation, the government of the Czechoslovak Republic firmly opposes the emergence of a strong and aggressive West German "Wehrmacht" nurtured by revanchism and hatred of our people in a place close to our border. The Czechoslovak government believes that, in order to be responsible to its own people, it will take the necessary new measures to further strengthen our country's defense forces and strengthen the combat power of its army, so that no one dares to covet our borders.

Czechoslovakia and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, as well as the people's democratic countries, have concluded treaties of alliance. These treaties guarantee the implementation of comprehensive mutual assistance to prevent any aggression by German militarism, and to oppose anyone who forms an alliance with German militarism to carry out aggression in Europe.

The government of the Czechoslovak Republic also believes, like everyone else, that the direct consequence of the Paris Agreements will be the German militarists' re-implementation of their old policy of "eastward advance." Once this agreement is ratified, the participants of this conference must undoubtedly take joint measures to strengthen and guarantee their own security.

The ratification of the Paris Agreements means that some Western countries are establishing aggressive military forces with the West German "Wehrmacht" as the core. These military forces are primarily aimed at the countries of the democratic camp. In view of this, the government of the Czechoslovak Republic believes that, under these circumstances, it is necessary for the countries participating in the conference to jointly take some measures to strengthen and deploy their armed forces and place these forces under a unified command.

The Czechoslovak government also believes that the revival of West German militarism and the establishment of an aggressive West German army would first threaten the borders of Czechoslovakia, the People's Republic of Poland, and the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, the Czechoslovak government believes that once the Paris Agreements are ratified, especially the governments of the above-mentioned countries, due to their shared interests in the struggle against this danger, must take effective joint measures to protect their borders.

The Czechoslovak government and all the Czechoslovak people believe that this conference of ours is of great significance to the entire Europe. The issue of safeguarding European peace and security, which is very important, is being discussed at the conference. The conference will clearly point out to the people of Europe and the world what dangers the ratification of the Paris Agreements and the re-militarization of West Germany may cause. The conference will clearly point out the path that freedom-loving people can take. Following this path, they will resolutely and unwaveringly crush the plans of the aggressive bloc and safeguard their own security and European peace.

The Czechoslovak delegation believes that this conference will definitely fulfill its mission and live up to the expectations of our people and all the peace-loving people of Europe and the world. The Czechoslovak delegation will do its best to ensure the success of this conference, to prevent the danger of a new war, and to maintain and consolidate peace.

    当捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府还在同苏联政府进行初步磋商的时候，就已对苏联政府提出的新的崇高建议表示真诚的欢迎和完全的支持。这一建议的目的是为了防止威胁着爱好和平的欧洲各国人民和威胁着欧洲和平以及世界和平的危险，而这种危险是由于西方国家政府不惜一切代价力图批准几个星期以前由美国同一些西欧国家政府所缔结的片面性的巴黎协定造成的。历史经验告诉捷克斯洛伐克人民：每一个爱自由和爱和平的国家的利益要求大家多方努力制止西德军国主义的复活和把西德拖进一些西方国家组成的侵略集团。因此，捷克斯洛伐克政府无条件地支持苏联政府提出的关于召开建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的会议的建议。
    显然，一些欧洲国家的政府不理解无例外地威胁着一切国家的危险的严重性，屈服在一些西方强国的压力下，拒绝参加这次会议。毫无疑问，如果它们今后还固执着这样的方针，那么可能给它们的人民带来严重的损害和造成威胁。
    同时，那些策划西德军国主义化和把西德拖进侵略集团的西方国家不仅自己不愿意参加全欧会议，而且直接地和公开地压迫其他国家，妄图阻挠这次会议的举行。这样，它们就完全现出了它们是欧洲和平和安全的敌人的面貌，从而也证实了它们今后还打算继续实行有致命危险的“实力政策”，而巴黎协定正是这种政策的明显的体现。
    在这种情况下，出席这次讨论欧洲和平和安全问题会议的爱好和平的国家，它们的任务就尤其严重，它们的责任就尤其重大了。捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府本着捷克斯洛伐克人民的切身利益和他们的意志，对苏联政府的建议表示了肯定的态度。捷克斯洛伐克人民极力要求和平和各国人民之间的和平合作，他们不准许任何人来破坏他们为进一步繁荣自己的自由美好的国家而进行的伟大的建设性劳动。而且捷克斯洛伐克政府充分地相信，它的这种行动同时也是符合各国人民维护和巩固欧洲和平以及世界和平的愿望的，因为它认识到，和平同安全是互不可分的。捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府一贯执行保卫和平和主张政治制度和社会制度不同的各国进行和平合作的政策，它从一开始就反对巴黎协定。巴黎协定是用来反对爱好和平的各国人民的自由和独立的，巴黎协定就是要使在欧洲发生新战争的危险加深，因为这一协定的主要的和直接的目的是使西德重新军国主义化和把西德拖进由一些西方国家组成的侵略集团。
    居住在欧洲中部的捷克斯洛伐克人民的命运一向是和欧洲的发展密切相关的。我国拥有丰富的天然富源，我国人民爱好劳动和爱好自由。所以我国自古以来就是德国军国主义者垂涎的目标。我国人民在争取自己民族和国家生存的不间断的斗争中逐渐锻炼出来和成长起来，同时在很大程度上促进民主和自由的进步思想在欧洲胜利传播。因此，欧洲事务的发展对捷克斯洛伐克来说是特别重要的。
    巴黎协定破坏了最重要的一个欧洲问题——德国问题获得解决的可能性，而解决这个问题却是欧洲局势进一步发展的关键。捷克斯洛伐克既然是德国的近邻，因此就特别关心使德国问题能够依照和平和各国人民友好的精神求得解决。捷克斯洛伐克人民在自己多事的历史中，曾多次遭到德国军国主义的侵略，德国军国主义永远是他们的死敌。捷克斯洛伐克人民过去曾亲身体验到德国军国主义的扩张和日尔曼化的野心，他们总是把我们国家作为他们“东进”侵略政策的主要目标之一。德国军国主义的这些野心在第一次世界大战后、特别是在苏维埃国家成立后得到了美国和西欧各国统治集团的支持，这些国家的统治集团妄想把德国军国主义的侵略矛头转向东方，对准苏联，同时他们不顾对捷克斯洛伐克所承担的一切国际法义务和保证而毫不犹豫地牺牲掉捷克斯洛伐克。
    大家知道：他们失算了，德国军国主义掉转头来侵略他们；结果，西欧各国的人民因为他们本国政府的不合理的、近视的政策，付出了很高的代价。某些西欧国家的政府现在又使本国的人民遭到同样的危险。不用怀疑，如果西德的军国主义复活起来了，那么他们迟早还是要掉过头来进攻西欧各国。不仅已有的历史经验，而且西德目前事态的发展情况都可以证明这一点。
    德国侵略的凶焰给捷克斯洛伐克人民带来的牺牲特别重。第一次世界大战结束后，德国统治集团紧接着就在捷克斯洛伐克的日尔曼民族主义者中扶植和煽动民族统一主义情绪。早在洛迦诺条约签订时，德国政府就已在原则上拒绝保证捷克斯洛伐克的边界。大家知道，当时德国总理史特莱斯曼在洛迦诺会议后说：“西方有了保证，我们重新要取得东方，未来的事态发展将依从这一点。”
    当德国军国主义分子在西方国家的同意和支持下在纳粹主义的德国登台的时候，德国军国主义对捷克斯洛伐克的侵略威胁也加深了。威胁、讹诈和挑衅等行为加紧了，而当时的捷克斯洛伐克的投降政府没有给这种行为以应有的反抗，因而为后来纳粹德国侵占捷克斯洛伐克开了方便之门。捷克斯洛伐克成了德国纳粹分子和军国主义分子攫取世界霸权中的首当其冲的国家之一。西方反动集团在慕尼黑悲剧中牺牲了捷克斯洛伐克的自由和独立。这一悲剧对于全世界是一个警告，它说明同侵略者妥协的政策会得到如何的下场，说明同德国军国主义妥协会得到怎样的结果。慕尼黑悲剧后，纳粹分子占领了捷克斯洛伐克，这开始了我国历史上最惨痛的时期。捷克斯洛伐克人民在争取自身的解放、摧毁希特勒法西斯主义这一空前残暴的德国军国主义的斗争中，付出了重大的牺牲。一九三九年十一月十七日，利台斯，尤利乌斯·伏契克以及成千成千被折磨死的、被处死刑的和牺牲的英雄们，不仅永远保留在我们的记忆中，而且也永远保留在世界上所有正直人们的记忆中。
    我国人民从来没有停止过反对德国军国主义的斗争，因为他们从用高昂代价取得的经验中得出了教训。当苏联军队一九四五年五月使我国人民重新获得自由以后，我国人民走上了人民民主的道路，选择了同伟大的苏联结成最亲密的友谊和联盟的道路。只有苏联，忠实于它承担的同盟者的义务，在慕尼黑阴谋和一九三九年三月十五日这些紧要关头同我国人民站在一起；只有苏联，在拯救人类摆脱德国纳粹主义和军国主义的灾难中作出如此巨大的贡献。捷克斯洛伐克人民坚决地绝对不能再让自己的国家沦为德国军国主义侵略的牺牲品。永远活在我们记忆中的总统克利门特·哥特瓦尔德的话鲜明地表现出我们人民的这种坚定决心。他说：“捷克斯洛伐克人民切身关心这个斗争。他们绝不让自己的国土再受德国侵略者的蹂躏。他们绝不让勃兰登堡分子、齐克孟达分子、白山的费迪兰分子和文迪希格雷兹分子再在自己的国家横行霸道，也不愿再跟新的海德里希分子打交道。”
    充满这种决心的我国人民，完全拥护大国签订的波茨坦协定。在第二次世界大战年代中结成强大的反法西斯同盟的各大国，在波茨坦协定中规定它们战后对德政策的宗旨，它们曾经保证完全肃清德国军国主义，采取有效的措施以防止德国军国主义的复活或改组。这些大国还保证消灭德国的纳粹主义，竭尽一切力量使纳粹主义不能复活，并制止任何形式的纳粹主义和军国主义的活动或宣传。它们同时保证，它们的对德政策是要为在民主基础上改造德国的政治生活和使德国参加国际的和平合作准备条件。同时必须着重指出，波茨坦协定规定的对德政策是以德国始终是一个统一的国家这个必要的先决条件为依据的，而占领国家也应该这样对待德国。
    从一九四五年以来，捷克斯洛伐克已作了巨大的努力，力求促使本着这个协定的精神求得德国问题的解决。捷克斯洛伐克政府有关德国问题的一切言论和行动都证明这一点。
    巴黎协定表明，西方国家，首先是美国，要对德国至今仍然分裂的状态负责，西方国家在它们所控制的德国西部，走上了复活德国帝国主义、纳粹主义和军国主义的道路，因而彻底违背了它们在波茨坦所承担的义务。它们在西德的政策，特别是巴黎协定，是对波茨坦公告中它们所必须履行的那些义务的嘲弄。波茨坦公告中说：“德国之军国主义及纳粹主义将予根除，各盟国将一致同意于目前或未来采取其他保证使德国永不再威胁其邻邦或世界和平之必要措置。”
    只有苏联继续忠实于波茨坦协定的精神。它是所有占领国家中唯一公正和一贯地执行着它所承担的一切义务的国家。苏联在德国东部真正地肃清了纳粹主义和军国主义，实行真正的民主化。它的政策帮助德国人民民主力量巩固和壮大。这样它就为德国东部的德国人民创造了条件，使他们得以建立起德国有史以来第一个爱好和平的和真正民主的国家——德意志民主共和国。捷克斯洛伐克人民一向善于把爱好和平的德国劳动人民同德国军国主义者和垄断资本家区别开来，因此从德意志民主共和国诞生的第一天起，捷克斯洛伐克人民就对它怀着完全信任和友好的感情，并愿意同它合作。因为捷克斯洛伐克人民看到，在全德国一切和平民主力量争取使德国成为一个无愧为欧洲爱好和平人民大家庭中一员的国家的斗争中，德意志民主共和国是这些力量的基础和堡垒。捷克斯洛伐克已同德意志民主共和国建立了并发展着政治上、经济上和文化上的最友好的关系，这种关系是我国人民和德国人民之间关系的幸福的新纪元的开始。不用说，这种关系是只有在德意志民主共和国诞生和成长为一个真正和平民主的国家的条件下才能建立起来的。毫无疑问，同统一、民主、爱好和平的德国之间也能充分地发展这种关系。但是，巴黎协定的批准和实施，就会使得这样一个统一和民主的德国长期不能建立，而且可能是西德遭到新灾难的开端。西德好几年来已成为对我国进行敌意活动的根据地。
    在西德，有一批人越来越蛮横无耻地发出叫嚣，要向捷克斯洛伐克共和国算账，要吞并我们的领土和消灭我们这个独立自主的国家。
    我们直接从波恩统治集团的官方人物、从阿登纳总理、他的部长和议员们的口中听到复仇主义的要求；从事先被任命为正在筹组中的西德复仇主义军队的司令官、前希特勒“国防军”将领和军官的
  口里听到这种要求。这些人物叫嚣对我们和我们的盟友发起“十字军”，并且要求恢复慕尼黑边界。我们又再次听到纳粹主义思想武库中最熟悉的术语，如：“德意志帝国”、“欧洲空间”、“德国在东方的使命”等等。这恰恰就是我们在第二次世界大战前所常常听到的要求，说这些话的人也恰恰是以前的那些人。显然，复仇主义就是波恩统治集团的政治主张。这一集团——极端反动的复仇派的代言人和拥护者——是德国人民的死敌。波恩的阿登纳集团不愿以和平的方式来统一德国，因为他们需要德国的分裂，以便实现他们的阴谋。因此，他们拒绝走德国东、西方代表进行谈判的道路。他们不希望和平，他们希望战争，因为他们希望在战争中以暴力夺得整个德国，而且夺取第二次世界大战时希特勒德国所占领的地方。也就是因为这样，他们才坚持主张实施巴黎协定。然而，不必多说大家也可以知道，波恩统治集团狂想的计划，也正如当年希特勒的疯狂计划一样，是和现实相距很远的。
    西德复仇主义者和军国主义者这种故意的行动，在西方国家、首先是在美国那种导致复活军国主义的政策中，得到完全的支持。
    美国统治集团利用其占领国的地位，把西德变成根据“共同安全”法对和平阵营国家进行敌对活动的前哨基地，在他们的这种敌对活动的对象中，捷克斯洛伐克占有相当重要的地位。
    美国机关派遣恐怖分子、颠覆分子和间谍越过我国西部边界进来，指使他们进行恐怖活动，组织叛国集团，搜集间谍情报和散发挑拨性的传单。我国内政部的机关在一九五二—一九五三年中，捕获了派到我国来的间谍、颠覆分子和恐怖分子共有一千二百名，这就可以证明这种罪恶活动的规模是多么大。
    目前，在我们的边境上经常发生边境事件，这些事件都是一个离我国有数千公里的国家——美国的军队所挑起的，这一点就足以说明德国目前违反常情的情况。这些事件的毒害气氛，加剧国际紧张局势。
    从西德领土上对我国进行的暗害和敌视活动没有达到目的。我国人民正警惕地保卫着我国的安全，决不让任何人破坏我们的共和国。我国人民以极大的愤慨谴责和惩罚间谍和颠覆活动，并且以极端蔑视的态度，来反击来自西德基地并且归西德基地领导的一切诬蔑和挑衅攻势。
    但是，姑且不论这种从西德的领土上对我们进行的暗害和敌对活动的结果是如何悲惨，这种活动本身说明了一个国家在极其蛮横地干涉另外一个国家的内部事务，否认和破坏了大家公认的国际法原则，同时严重地违反了西方国家（包括美国在内）作为德国的占领国所承担的义务。
    毫无疑问，如果规定西德重新军国主义化和将它拖入侵略集团的巴黎协定一旦实施，从西德领土上对我们共和国进行的敌对活动就会加紧起来。
    巴黎协定如果批准，复仇主义的势力就会得到有力的怂恿和支持，而且，在西方国家的支持下，复仇主义就会成为军国主义西德的官方政策。如果说，在现在西德还没有正规军的时候，波恩复仇主义者的活动就如此猖狂，那么，毫无疑问，在波恩复仇主义者一旦获得复活起来的“国防军”这件他们自己的武器后，这种活动就要更加厉害了。西德建立“国防军”，就等于复仇主义者掌握了他们要在东方和西方实现他们的侵略计划所必需的物质力量。
    显然，西德一旦变成战争温床，对我国边界进行的直接敌对活动就会加紧，除了美国军队的挑衅以外，还将会有复活起来的“国防军”来进行挑衅。
    我只要翻一下历史就可以看到，建立来反对其他国家排他性军事集团的政策，除了导致战争之外，从来不曾产生其他的结局。像巴黎协定所规定那样，使重新军国主义化的西德参加侵略性公约并且作为它的核心，就会使这种公约更富有侵略性，就会更加加剧欧洲的战争危险。
    而这正是巴黎协定的策划者所需要的。巴黎协定是战争协定；它的目的是加剧紧张局势，在欧洲造成发生冲突的策源地，利用复活起来的西德军国主义发动新世界大战。这是为人民所唾弃和憎恨的、利用侵略性的德国军国主义来反对欧洲爱好自由的人民的老一套的政策。这种政策的策划者终于暴露了自己的真面目。世界公众怀着十分愤慨的情绪听到英国首相邱吉尔不久以前所作的招供，他承认，在第二次世界大战将结束时，他曾下指示给蒙哥马利元帅，要他小心地收集和保存德军的武器，以便在英国政府一旦认为需要和德国士兵合作共同来反对苏联时，能够很方便地把这些武器重新发给德国士兵。这意思就是说，当苏军不顾牺牲、在同德国法西斯的殊死战中完成自己崇高的解放使命的时候，当苏军也是为了英国人民的自由而流血的时候，英国政府却在讨论是否有可能利用敌人的军队来反对自己的盟国的问题，英国的统治集团既然准备把法西斯军国主义的军事力量收容在自己的麾下，那就等于说他们也准备转过来采取这些军事力量所奉行的政策——即德国法西斯主义的政策。这种算盘在一九四五年没有能实现。不到十年以后，巴黎协定又在为实现这种图谋而效劳了。
    西德的整个事态发展证明，西德的军国主义分子没有从第二次世界大战的失败中吸取任何教训，他们丝毫没有转变，相反地，他们愈来愈疯狂地仇视爱好自由的国家。正因为如此，西方国家的政府企图要把西德军国主义分子拉入它们的军事集团，以此来进一步加深这种集团的侵略性质。
    批准巴黎协定将为西德军国主义侵略开辟道路。但是，西欧各国的人民认识到，复活德国军国主义和把德国军国主义拉入侵略公约能产生的致命危险。西德人民反对复活德国军国主义的运动日益强大起来了。复活军国主义的人不得不愈来愈小心地掩饰自己的真正意图。因此，他们厚颜无耻地把作为战争工具的巴黎协定说成是和平工具。因此他们欺骗人们说，在缓和国际紧张局势方面所取得的成就只能归功于“实力”政策，甚至说，批准巴黎协定可以使在这方面得到新的成就。不难证明，事实与此完全相反，批准巴黎协定会大大加剧国际紧张局势。
    侵略集团的另外一种同样性质的辩解说法是：爱好和平的国家的人民将不得不容忍已成“既成事实”的西德重新军国主义化，他们不会采取反措施来对付这一事实。但是，爱好和平的各国人民不能容忍西德重新军国主义化，因为容忍西德重新军国主义化就意味着容忍战争。
      “实力”政策从爱好自由的各国人民方面只能得到一个回答：以更大的实力为后盾的政策。
    为了遏止西欧各国人民、首先是法国人民（他们已经粉碎了想藉助“欧洲防务集团”来实现西德重新军国主义化的企图）对巴黎协定的反对，西方国家统治者硬说这一协定提供了某种“保证”来防止德国军国主义侵犯的危险，他们想用这种谎言来争取批准巴黎协定。
    关于这种所谓“保证”的一切喧嚷，不是别的，只是一种明显的诡计，目的在于向西欧各国人民掩饰巴黎协定的真正目的，以麻痹西欧各国人民对复活西德“国防军”的警惕。
    这就是对下面这个初看起来不能理解的事实的唯一正确的解释：西方国家侵略集团一方面顽固地要复活西德军国主义，强调这个步骤是“必需的”，另一方面却谈论必须要有防范德国军国主义的某种
  “保证”。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民根据自己的经验，最清楚，对他们过去也曾得到过的防止德国军国主义侵犯威胁的这一类“保证”应作如何估价。
    第一次世界大战的和约曾经规定了我国的边界。捷克斯洛伐克的安全本应该在那个不名誉的国际联盟规章范围内得到保证的。它的安全在白里安—凯洛克公约中又得到了一次保证，这个公约也有德国签字的。法捷条约对于捷克斯洛伐克说来，本来也是作为一种防止德国侵略的保证的。然而大家知道，到一九三八年德国军国主义发动侵略时，这种和那种的“保证”究竟有什么用。只要德国军国主义者一旦感到自己有足够的力量来为实现自己统治世界的野心而动武的时候，这一切“保证”都变成
  一纸空文了。至于可耻的慕尼黑协定的那些条款，则是对国际关系中“保证”这个概念的一种不折不扣的嘲笑，这些条款也曾“保证过”支离破碎的捷克斯洛伐克继续存在下去。当一九三九年三月西欧国家的慕尼黑伙伴蛮横无礼地把捷克斯洛伐克共和国的剩余的一部分都吞并了的时候，西欧的那些保证人连指头也不动一动。
    我国人民相信：复活德国军国主义的人所提出的防止德国军国主义侵略的一切“保证”都是没有任何价值的，相反的，这些“保证”只是帮助掩饰德国军国主义侵略计划的策划。因此，捷克斯洛伐克人民对关于“保证”的一切谎言极其警惕，巴黎协定的缔约国就打算用这种“保证”来麻痹欧洲人民的警惕性，使他们容忍德国军国主义的复活。
    担保防止复活了的德国军国主义的危险的巴黎
  “保证”实际上不是什么保证。可以防止这种危险的唯一保证就是不复活德国军国主义，就是制止德国重新军国主义化。这是使欧洲人民的安全不受德国军国主义威胁的唯一办法，德国军国主义永远是欧洲人民的自由和独立的死敌。
    根据上述种种理由，捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府深深地相信：解决包括德国问题在内的欧洲和平和安全问题的唯一办法，就是根据苏联政府的建议建立欧洲集体安全体系。苏联的建议是从社会和经济制度不同的国家有可能和平共处出发的。它完全符合联合国宪章的所有根本原则和宗旨。因此，建议中的集体安全体系规定一切欧洲国家真正参加这一体系，贯穿着始终不变地尊重所有大大小小参加国家的独立和主权的精神。在这个体系的范围内，欧洲国家应当承担义务，不把自己的武装力量用于进攻目的，绝不互相侵犯，并且应当互相保证参加反对欧洲武装侵略威胁的集体行动。苏联的建议还主张，这个体系的参加国有义务全面地支持发展经济方面的互相合作。苏联的建议还主张把德国的两部分包括进全欧安全体系内，以便将来建立一个统一、民主的德国，这就使得在西德制造欧洲新战争的温床成为不可能了。
    因此，捷克斯洛伐克政府深信，根据苏联的建议建立有效的欧洲集体安全体系，就意味着保障和平和巩固包括我国在内的一切欧洲国家的安全。建立这个体系就可以为重新统一德国和建立一个独立的、爱好和平的和民主的德国创造前提。这对捷克斯洛伐克有巨大的意义，因为这样，我国的西南边界就不再会成为发生冲突和形成紧张局面的边界，而成为和平和实行有效合作的边界了。
    建立欧洲集体安全体系，就会成为我们同一切欧洲国家广泛地和全面地发展政治、经济和文化关系的基础。集体安全体系的建立就将使建立互相敌对的集团的政策和分裂欧洲的政策停止执行，并且可以保证过去遭过这些政策祸害的一切欧洲国家获得持久和平。
    用不着说明，为了使得对于欧洲一切国家的人民都是珍贵的建立欧洲集体安全体系这一主张能够实现，西方国家完全必须永远停止执行使西德重新军国主义化的有害政策，停止执行巴黎协定的政策。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府完全依据捷克斯洛伐克全体人民的意见，在一九五四年三月二十四日曾经发表声明，欢迎苏联代表团在柏林会议上提出的建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。捷克斯洛伐克政府声明，捷克斯洛伐克共和国准备参加保障集体安全的全欧条约，并将支持为缔结这种条约而作的一切努力。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府在一九五四年七月二十四日关于日内瓦会议的声明中以及在一九五四年九月二十八日给法国、英国、南斯拉夫、比利时、荷兰、挪威和丹麦各国政府的照会中，一再着重申述了这一意见，对复活德国军国主义和复仇主义的危险提出了紧急的警告，并且呼吁采取必要措施，来和平解决德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系。我国全体人民以高涨的热情欢迎苏联政府十一月十三日照会中提出的关于召开讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的全欧会议的建议。捷克斯洛伐克共和国全国的人民发动了强大的爱国主义运动浪潮，表示坚决斥责巴黎协定，斥责复活军国主义的政策。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会外交委员会一九五四年十一月十六日举行的会议在讨论了政府声明之后，一致通过了一封致欧洲各国议会议员的信，呼吁他们为了他们的国家和人民的利益，把和平事业保卫到底，拒绝同意侵略性的巴黎协定，呼吁他们坚决要求他们的政府参加讨论建立欧洲集体安全体系问题的会议。
    十一月十八日，捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线在布拉格宫召开代表会议，参加这次会议的有捷克斯洛伐克各阶层居民的代表、各政党、群众组织、教会、工厂、农业合作社的代表和著名的科学家和艺术家。他们发表“告欧洲人民书”如下：
      “值此决定性的时刻，我们向欧洲各国提出警告：复活德国军国主义有着严重的危险。我们争取和平不仅是为了我们自己，也是为了欧洲各国人民，其中包括我们希望同他们友好和和睦共处的德国人民。
      “我们衷心欢迎苏联的和平建议。符合欧洲各国人民切身利益的道路不是伦敦协定和巴黎协定的策划者所力图实现的一些国家组成军事集团来反对其他国家的计划，而是友好的和平共处。”
    在城市和乡村的无数集会上，全体捷克斯洛伐克人民一致发出了强有力的、响亮的声音。我国人民在无数声明和决议中，向西欧各国人民、特别是向法国人民发出号召，希望他们更加强有力地起来粉碎复活德国军国主义的计划。我国人民以兄弟般的声援来全力支持西方和平战士的英勇斗争。我国人民知道，在争取维护和平和制止战争威胁的斗争的现阶段中，人民首先应该表示意见。
    十一月二十八日举行了国民议会选举——捷克斯洛伐克人民在选举中表示完全同意民族阵线政府尽力保障我国人民和平幸福生活的立场，并且表示充分信任这个政府。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民反对德国军国主义复活、争取欧洲和平和安全的斗争表明，我国全国人民在和平和祖国安全问题中表现出一种坚定的精神上和政治上的团结，这种团结是无论什么东西、无论什么人都不能加以动摇的。捷克斯洛伐克人民表现了高度的觉悟。他们认识到自己的力量和以苏联为首的整个强大的和平阵营的力量。任何军事威胁都吓不倒我国人民。我国人民有着保卫我们亲爱的祖国的自由和独立的一切必需条件，我国人民将不遗余力地来加强祖国的防御力量。
  我们同强大的、不可战胜的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟有着同盟条约。我们同欧洲各人民民主国家也以同盟条约联结起来了。站在我们一起的有着一个六亿人口的和平大国——中华人民共和国。和我们在一起的还有全世界数以亿计的和平拥护者。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民唯一的希望就是今后能够和平地建设我们国家的幸福生活。他们不威胁任何人，愿意同一切国家和平共处，实行有成效的合作。他们不拒绝任何人对他们伸出真诚和友谊的手。但是，谁都不必怀疑，假如西方国家实施它们复活西德军国主义的计划，捷克斯洛伐克人民将一分钟也不会松懈自己的努力，来保证自己不受别人侵犯。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府深信，最近几月来世界和欧洲局势的发展为奠定欧洲各国和平共处的基础提供了现实的可能，并且为根据和平的利益和包括德国人民在内的欧洲各国人民的切身利益来解决德国问题提供了现实的可能。还来得及走上建立单一的欧洲国家和平阵营的道路和集体安全的道路。还来得及完成当前欧洲和世界局势中的基本任务：在各大国以及德国东西两部分政府取得协议的基础上，在举行全德自由选举和缔结对德和约的基础上，重新统一德国为一个和平民主的国家。但是，这条道路只有在这样的条件下才是开放的：就是要不批准巴黎协定，西方国家放弃现在实行的复活西德军国主义的方针，放弃建立包括军国主义的西德在内的西方国家侵略集团的方针，放弃反对爱好和平的各国人民的自由和独立、反对和平利益的方针，放弃准备新战争的方针。在这两条道路之间没有第三条道路，也不可能有折衷办法。或者是西方国家今后仍旧顽固地执行现在的方针，那么它们就要对一切后果负完全的责任。或者是它们放弃这一好战的方针，那就立刻具备一切条件，以和平和互相协商的办法，根据包括德国和西方国家在内的一切国家的利益，来解决欧洲问题和世界问题。
    西方国家说，它们只准备依靠“实力地位”来同苏联以及其他民主国家进行谈判。这就是说，它们要在战争威胁和挥动着刀枪的情况下进行谈判，它们想要用新的西德“国防军”和西方侵略集团的刺刀来威胁别人接受它们的意志。它们忘记了，这种计划今天是完全不现实的，在现在的力量对比下，它们注定是要完全失败的。它们忘记了，在反对这一好战政策的斗争中，有一个团结的和强大的民主国家阵营在维护着和平及各国人民的自由和独立，由于这些国家的人民有着一致的意志和目标，这个阵营是强有力的和不可战胜的。我们再次严肃地重申，如果西方国家要用实力来跟我们打交道，那么我们的回答是：更加团结，更加巩固我们的力量。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府坚决表示，如果巴黎协定一旦批准，它将根据这种情况而采取一切必要的措施来保障自己的人民和自己的国家的安全。
    鉴于局势的严重，捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府坚决反对在紧靠我国边境的地方出现一支以复仇主义和憎恨我国人民的精神培育起来的、有力量的和富有侵略性的西德“国防军”。捷克斯洛伐克政府认为，为了对自己的人民负责，它将采取必需的新措施来进一步加强我国的国防力量，加强自己军队的战斗力量，使得任何人都不敢觊觎我国的边界。
    捷克斯洛伐克和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟以及各人民民主国家缔结了同盟条约，这些条约保证实行全面互助，以防止德国军国主义的任何侵犯，并且反对同德国军国主义结成联盟来在欧洲实行侵略的任何人。
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府也和大家一样地认为，巴黎协定的直接后果将会是德国军国主义重新执行他们“东进”的老政策，这个协定一旦批准，本会议的参与国无疑必须采取共同的措施来加强和保证自己的安全。
    批准巴黎协定意味着某些西方国家建立侵略性的军事力量，这些力量的核心是西德“国防军”。这些军事力量的矛头首先针对着民主阵营国家。有鉴于此，捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府认为，在这种情况下，参加会议的国家就有必要共同采取一些措施，来加强和调配它们的武装部队，并把这些部队置于单一的司令部之下。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府同时认为，复活西德军国主义和建立侵略性的西德军队，会首先威胁到捷克斯洛伐克、波兰人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的边境，因此，捷克斯洛伐克政府认为：一旦巴黎协定批准，特别是上述国家政府，由于在反对这种危险的斗争中利害一致，就必须采取有效的共同措施来保障自己边境。
    捷克斯洛伐克政府和全体捷克斯洛伐克人民相信，我们这次会议对整个欧洲有极大的意义。会议所讨论的是十分重要的保障欧洲和平和安全的问题。会议将十分明确地向欧洲和全世界人民指出，批准巴黎协定和使西德重新军国主义化可能引起怎样的危险。会议将明确地指出一条爱好自由的人民走的道路，循着这条道路他们将坚决地、不可动摇地粉碎侵略集团的计划和维护自己的安全和欧洲的和平。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团相信，这次会议一定会完成它的使命，不负我国人民以及欧洲和世界各国一切爱好和平的人民的期望。捷克斯洛伐克代表团将竭尽全力来保证这次会议成功，以防止新战争危险，以维护和巩固和平。
