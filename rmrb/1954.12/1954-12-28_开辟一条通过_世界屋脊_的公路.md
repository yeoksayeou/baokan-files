The Kangzang Plateau is the "Roof of the World," and choosing an economical and reasonable highway route through the "Roof of the World" is a daunting task. We lacked both theoretical knowledge of route design and practical experience in building roads on the plateau. However, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, we confidently took on this task.

Unveiling the Mystery of Tibetan Geography

Tibetan geography has always been an unsolved mystery. There was very little data necessary for road design, and all work had to start from scratch. In the winter of 1950, a reconnaissance team was sent out from Ganzi to begin surveying the route from Mani-Ganggo to Qamdo. In the spring of 1951, the Transportation Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee organized a reconnaissance team to survey towards Lhasa with the army. They traveled back and forth on the Northern Route, Central Route, Minor Northern Route, and from Lhasa to Tselha Dzong, covering thousands of kilometers, for more than a year. They braved severe cold, endured hunger, disregarded the danger to their lives, and were out of contact for months. When they returned safely, they were in tattered clothes and their faces were covered with beards. In 1952, four more reconnaissance teams surveyed the southern route, and one reconnaissance team re-surveyed the central route, experiencing similar hardships. These reconnaissance teams made a long march, their footprints covering Tibet, and finally found seven comparative routes, initially unveiling the true face of Kangzang geography.

Selecting the Southern Route

Of the seven comparative routes, which one should we choose? The Southern Route, the Minor Northern Route, or the Central Route?

We compared the Minor Northern Route and the Southern Route. The Minor Northern Route had a high altitude, the engineering was arduous, construction was impossible in winter, and after completion, it could not be open to traffic year-round due to snow and ice. The higher the altitude at which a vehicle travels, the lower its capability, and the more easily the vehicle is damaged. Therefore, choosing the Minor Northern Route would not only increase construction costs, but also reduce the value of the route's use and increase transportation costs. The Southern Route has a low altitude and can be open to traffic year-round. Choosing the Southern Route would increase the value of the route's use and reduce transportation costs. The Minor Northern Route is a pastoral area, while the Southern Route is mostly an agricultural area with a large population and relatively rich mineral resources. Choosing the Southern Route would take into account the growing material and cultural needs of the Tibetan compatriots, both now and in the future.

However, the Southern Route has earthquakes, glaciers, quicksand, landslides and collapses, which would pose many difficulties in terms of construction technology. We analyzed the reconnaissance data, estimated the wisdom of the masses and the great technical assistance of the Soviet Union, and were confident that all technical difficulties could be solved. Thus, the Kangzang Highway selected the Southern Route.

Plateau Route Standards

Having selected the Southern Route, we had to consider: What level of road technology and standards would be appropriate for the transportation requirements of the Kangzang Highway?

Initially, the standards set for the Mani-Ganggo to Qamdo section had shortcomings. At that time, the requirements for the standards were not specific enough, there were very few technical documents on which to base the survey and design, and the design quality was not high, resulting in the route standards for the Mani-Ganggo to Qamdo section being mostly too low. However, the design of the Mani-Ganggo to Qamdo section trained us and educated us. In 1952, Soviet expert Belu Borodov came to Qamdo to participate in the route selection meeting for the Qamdo to Lhasa section. He pointed out many errors in our work, emphasized the importance of the technical grade and standards of road construction, introduced many theories and experiences in route design, and personally formulated the standards for the Kangzang Highway.

This was a landmark turning point in the route design work of the Kangzang Highway. From then on, we gained a preliminary understanding of some socialist design ideas, viewpoints and methods, and understood that economic investigation is the decisive factor in determining technical grade and standards. But in practice, we encountered difficulties again. If we were to investigate the road's freight exchange volume, passenger and freight flow direction, transport density, and future traffic volume needs, this was not something that could be completed in a short period of time. Moreover, the proportion of commodity economy on the Kangzang Plateau was extremely small, and there was no reliable data on underground resources. We could only make decisions mainly based on the changes in the economic situation that the highway would cause and the possibilities for future development.

When determining the new standards for the Qamdo to Lhasa section, some people thought that we should accommodate the standards of the Mani-Ganggo to Qamdo section, believing that the same route must have the same standards. According to Soviet experience, on a single route, the technical grade can be appropriately changed at certain intervals based on different conditions and combined with the terrain. Therefore, for a long route like the Kangzang Highway, it is necessary to adopt different technical grades as needed. For example, if the grade is high, the construction cost of the route will increase. The Mani-Ganggo to Qamdo section passes through six large mountains, and it is acceptable to adopt a lower technical grade; but the Qamdo to Lhasa section passes through the wealthy areas of Tibet and is a long-term trunk line, so it is also justifiable to adopt a higher technical grade. This comprehensive way of thinking finally overcame the one-sided thinking of striving for uniformity.

Surveying Thousands of Mountains

In the winter of 1952, three more surveying teams were organized west of Qamdo to carry out westward surveying; and two surveying teams west of Taizhao carried out surveying towards Lhasa. In the summer of 1953, two more surveying teams were added to the eastern section. Their flags flew everywhere on the Qamdo to Lhasa section, and their cheerful songs were heard. The surveyors walked rapidly and climbed like apes in the thousands of mountains. While fighting against nature, they also constantly carried out ideological struggles in their work.

In the early days of implementing the new standards, many people still adhered to the old standards. Once, two surveying teams were assigned to survey the 1,900-meter downhill line on the east bank of the Nujiang River. The lower section of the mountain was steep, and the new slope-setting method resulted in a good and economical route; the upper section of the mountain was flat, but the old method was used, resulting in a slope that was too flat, increased curves, and a longer route. It had to be re-surveyed before construction could begin. This taught us to boldly discard old and outdated things and bravely accept new experiences.

The leading ideology in route selection used to be how to avoid rock formations in order to reduce construction difficulties, which often led to routes being selected on the mountains, increasing the mileage due to avoiding rock formations. The error of this one-sided thinking has gradually been corrected after two years of debate and comparison in practice.

Construction Methods on the Plateau

The route has been surveyed. But how to build it? This became another problem.

The route is so long and the project is so arduous. In order to connect Tibet more closely with the motherland as soon as possible, it is necessary to first seek initial opening. Therefore, lower initial opening standards were determined. When designing the route, there were two design lines, "initial opening" and "completion", so that the survey and design of the route started from long-term higher standards, and the construction started from lower standards. This is in line with the spirit of the national general line and the future requirements for highway development.

Tibet lacks the manpower and material resources for road construction, and on-site transportation is extremely difficult. It is impossible to start construction on the entire line. In order to adapt to this situation, a phased and sectional construction method was decided, advancing section by section. However, this construction method still inevitably requires manual transport of materials, tools, and staple and non-staple foods. On the thin air of the Kangzang Plateau, manual transport is difficult. In order to minimize on-site transportation by manual transport, the measures of first seeking initial opening, utilizing automobile transportation, and then completing the project were determined.

Advancing towards Lhasa

The natural conditions of the Kangzang Plateau pose great difficulties for road construction. There is altitude sickness, leeches, grass lice, virgin forests, and areas lacking fuel. There are also serious technical difficulties such as glaciers, quicksand, earthquakes, swamp areas, landslides and collapses. However, no difficulty can stop the advance of the Kangzang Highway.

The Kangzang area has a high altitude and a severely cold climate. Snow and ice in high mountains and deep valleys accumulate to form glaciers. In summer, part of them melt, and the soil on both sides of the ditches is extremely unstable. Collapses block the water, and the water level rises, carrying mud and sand, rushing down all at once, sometimes like overturning mountains and overturning seas. Since the current traffic volume on the route is not large, the requirement for a thorough solution to glacier impact is not yet urgent. It was decided to adopt temporary roads for traffic in summer, repairing them as they are damaged, and constructing structures in the future to solve the problem. Small-scale glaciers have been overcome by erecting high bridges or paving permeable road surfaces.

Quicksand is sand of different sizes weathered from rocks, which gradually moves due to water seepage. Soviet expert Bi Qiujin guided us to adopt many methods to deal with quicksand: If the route can pass through the top of the quicksand, try to pass through the top; wherever the quicksand accumulates into a conical shape, the route will pass through the foot of the slope; if it cannot be solved simply from the route alignment, build inner and outer retaining walls to block the quicksand.

How to pass through earthquake zones? Soviet expert Belu Borodov also helped us solve this problem. According to the calculation formulas they introduced and past earthquake data, road foundations of different depths that can withstand earthquake waves were adopted.

Most of the snowy mountains and grasslands of the Kangzang Plateau are swamp areas. Passing through these areas, people and horses sink. We initially adopted the method of first draining water, then digging out the swamp soil, and replacing it with stones. The method was correct, but the project was huge. In 1954, the construction area accepted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. For certain grades of roads, the swamp soil was no longer completely excavated, only part of the surface was excavated, so that the roadbed would sink into the swamp soil due to its own weight and become stable. In areas where the swamp is very serious, wooden rafts are built with logs, laid on the swamp soil, and then a roadbed is built on the wooden rafts.

Kangzang snow and ice promote the weathering of mountain rocks. On steep slopes, a large amount of weathered rock products accumulate. The continuous falling of these stones causes landslides and collapses. The difference from quicksand is that these stones are larger than sand particles. We basically solved the threat of landslides and collapses by imitating the method of dealing with quicksand.

All kinds of difficulties have been overcome, and the highway is rapidly advancing towards Lhasa. (Attached pictures)

    开辟一条通过“世界屋脊”的公路

    康藏高原是“世界屋脊”，选择一条经济的、合理的通过“世界屋脊”的公路线，是一个艰巨的任务。我们既缺乏线路设计的理论修养，更缺乏高原筑路的实际经验。但是，在党的领导下，在苏联专家的帮助下，我们满怀信心地担负起这个任务。
    揭开西藏地理之谜
    西藏地理一直是个没有揭开的谜，很少有道路设计所必需的资料，一切工作都得从头来起。一九五○年冬，派了一个踏勘队由甘孜出发，开始勘查马尼干果至昌都的路线。一九五一年春，西南军政委员会交通部组织了一个踏勘队随军向拉萨踏勘。他们往返于北路、中路、小北路和拉萨至则拉宗，历程数千公里，为时一年有余，冒严寒、忍饥饿，不顾生命危险，失联络达数月之久。当他们安然归来时，已是破衣百结，须发满面。一九五二年又有四个踏勘队踏勘南线，一个踏勘队覆勘中线，同样历尽艰险。这些踏勘队万里长征，足迹遍于西藏，终于找出七条比较线，初步揭开了康藏地理的真面目。
    选定南线
    七条比较线，我们选定那一条？南线、小北线还是中线？
    我们比较了小北线和南线。小北线海拔高，工程艰巨，冬季不能施工，修通后，冬季冰雪封山，也不能全年通车，汽车行驶地区海拔愈高，能力愈小，车辆也容易损坏。因此，选定小北线，不仅增大建设成本，而且将降低线路的使用价值，增加运输成本。南线海拔低，可以全年通车，选定南线就能提高路线的使用价值和减低运输成本。小北线是牧畜区，南线大部分是农业区，人口多，矿产比较丰富。选定南线能够照顾到藏族同胞目前与将来日益增涨的物质生活和文化生活的需要。
    但是，南线有地震、冰川、流沙和碎落坍方，在施工技术上将有许多困难。我们分析了踏勘的资料，估计到群众的智慧和伟大苏联的技术援助，肯定所有技术困难都是可以解决的。康藏公路就这样选定了南线道。
    高原线路标准
    选定了南线，又要考虑：什么样的道路技术等级和标准才能适应康藏公路的运输要求？
    最初，确定马尼干果至昌都段的标准是有缺点的。当时对标准的要求很不具体，勘测设计所依据的技术文件很少，设计质量也不高，使马尼干果至昌都段的路线标准大部分偏低。但是，马尼干果至昌都段的设计锻炼了我们，教育了我们。一九五二年苏联专家别路·包罗多夫同志到昌都参加昌都至拉萨段的定线会议，他指出我们工作上的许多错误，强调要重视修建道路的技术等级及其标准，介绍了很多线路设计的理论和经验，并亲自为康藏公路拟定了标准。
    这是康藏公路线路设计工作上划时代的转折点。从此，我们初步理解了一些社会主义的设计思想，观点和方法，懂得经济调查是确定技术等级及其标准的决定因素。但在实践中又遇到困难。如果要调查道路的货物交流量、客货流向、运向运量的密度、将来需要的交通量，这就不是短期内所能完成的工作，况且康藏高原的商品经济比例极小，地下资源大都没有可靠的资料。我们就只能主要是从公路将引起的经济形势的变化及其将来发展的可能性来作决定。
    在确定昌都至拉萨段新标准的时候，有人认为应该迁就马尼干果至昌都段的标准，认为同一条路线必须同一个标准。根据苏联经验，在一条路线上，可以根据不同的情况，结合地形，按一定的距离适当地变更技术等级。因此，像康藏公路这样长的路线，根据需要采用不同的技术等级是必要的。例如，等级高，线路的建筑成本就将增加，马尼干果至昌都段沿线经过六座大山，采用较低的技术等级是可以的；但昌都至拉萨段经过西藏富庶地区，是长远的干线，采用较高的技术等级也是有理由的。这种全面考虑问题的思想，最后终于战胜了那种强求统一的片面思想。
    测过万重山
    一九五二年冬，在昌都以西又组织三个测量队，向西定测；在太昭以西也有两个测量队，向拉萨定测。一九五三年夏东段又增加了两个测量队。在昌都至拉萨段上，到处飘扬着他们的旗帜，听到他们愉快的歌声。测量队员们在万重山中急走如飞，攀登如猿。他们一面和自然作战，一面在工作中不断展开思想斗争。
    执行新标准的初期，还有许多人固守在旧标准的范围内。有一次，两个测量队分工定测怒江东岸一千九百公尺的下山线。下段山势陡峻，用新的定坡方法，线路好，而又经济；上段山势平坦，但沿用旧法，坡度太平，弯道增多，线路增长，开工前不得不改测。这教育我们要大胆地抛弃旧的陈腐的东西，勇敢地接受新的经验。
    以前选线的主导思想是如何避免石岩，以减少施工的困难，这样就常把路线选在山上，因避让石岩而增长了里程。这种片面思想的错误，经过两年来在实践中的争论和比较，已逐渐纠正。
    高原上的施工方法
    路线测好了。但是，怎样修？又成了问题。
    线路这样长，工程这样艰巨，为使西藏早日和祖国内地更紧密地联系起来，必须先求初通。因此，确定了较低的初通标准，在设计线路时有“初通”及“完成”两条设计线，使线路的勘测设计从长远较高的标准着眼，施工从较低的标准着手，这是符合于国家总路线的精神和将来对公路发展的要求的。
    西藏缺乏筑路的人力和物力，工地运输又极端困难，全线开工是不可能的。为适应这一情况，决定了分期分段的施工方法，逐段推进。但这种施工方法仍免不了要用人力背运料具和主、副食品，而在空气稀薄的康藏高原上，背运是困难的，为求尽量减少背运的工地运输，确定了先求初通、利用汽车运输、然后竣工的措施。
    向拉萨前进
    康藏高原的自然条件给予筑路的困难是巨大的，有高山病、有蚂蝗、有草虱，有原始森林，有缺乏燃料的地区，更有冰川、流沙、地震、泥沼地区和碎落坍方等技术上的严重困难。但是，任何困难都不能阻挡康藏公路的前进。
    康藏地方海拔高，气候严寒，高山深谷的冰雪积成冰川，夏季部分融化，加以沟渠两侧土壤极不稳定，坍塌堵水，水位高涨后夹带泥沙，一拥而下，有时竟如排山倒海。由于目前线路的运量还不大，彻底解决冰川冲击的要求还不迫切，决定夏季采取便道通车，随毁随修，将来再修建构造物来解决，小规模的冰川，已采用架设高桥或砌透水路面的办法战胜了它。
    流沙是岩石风化成的大小不同的沙子，因渗水而逐渐移动。苏联专家毕秋金同志指导我们采用了很多处理流沙的方法：线路可能由流沙顶部通过的，尽量从顶部通过；凡流沙堆积成圆锥体形状，线路就从坡脚通过；单纯从线位上不能解决的，做内外挡土墙把流沙挡住。
    地震区怎样通过？苏联专家别路·包罗多夫同志也帮助我们解决了这个问题。根据他们介绍的计算公式和过去的地震资料，采用了足以承受地震波及的不同深度的线路基础。
    康藏高原的雪山草地大部分就是泥沼地区。通过这些地区，人马下陷。我们最初采用先排水、再挖去泥沼土壤、换填石块的方法施工。方法是正确的，可是工程很大。一九五四年的施工地区接受了苏联的先进经验，对于某些等级的道路，不再将泥沼土壤全部挖去，只是挖去表面的一部分，让路堤由于本身的重量下沉至泥沼土壤内，得到稳定。泥沼很严重的地区，用圆木修成木排，铺在泥沼土壤上面，再在木排上修筑路堤。
    康藏冰雪促进了山岩的风化，在严峻的山坡上，堆积着大量风化岩石的产物，这些石块的不断下落，造成碎落坍方。与流沙不同的地方，就在于这些石块比沙子的颗粒要大。我们基本上仿照处理流沙的方法解决了碎落坍方的威胁。
    各种各样困难都被战胜了，公路迅速向拉萨前进。（附图片）
