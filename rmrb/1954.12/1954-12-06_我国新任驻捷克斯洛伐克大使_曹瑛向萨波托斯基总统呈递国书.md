Ambassador Cao Ying's speech:
Respected Comrade President:

It is with great pleasure that I present to you the credentials from the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Czechoslovak Republic.

Comrade President, as I present my credentials, please allow me, on behalf of the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and all the Chinese people, to extend our most sincere respect to you, and through you, to the fraternal Czechoslovak people.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the Czechoslovak people have achieved great successes in consolidating the people's democratic system and building socialism. The victorious completion of the First Five-Year Economic Construction Plan has greatly strengthened Czechoslovakia's economic power and created the necessary conditions for vigorously developing agriculture and improving the living standards of the working people. The recent overwhelming victory in the elections to the Czechoslovak National Assembly and the Slovak National Council fully demonstrates the close unity of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia. While diligently engaged in peaceful construction, the Czechoslovak people have consistently concerned themselves with safeguarding and consolidating world peace, and have waged unremitting struggles to ease international tensions and oppose the imperialist policy of war. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the remarkable achievements made by the Czechoslovak people in the great cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace. Comrade President, for five years, our two peoples have cared for and supported each other, and have firmly established a sincere fraternal friendship and close cooperative relations. With the advancement of our two countries' socialist construction, our economic cooperation and cultural exchanges are expanding day by day. For the prosperity and happiness of our two peoples, the friendship and cooperation between our two countries will surely be increasingly consolidated and developed.

Comrade President, I assure you that during my tenure as Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Czechoslovak Republic, I will contribute all my strength to consolidating and developing the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples. I am deeply convinced that I will receive your assistance and support, and that of the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, in carrying out this important task.

President Zápotocký's reply:
Comrade Ambassador:

I am very pleased to accept the credentials from Comrade Chairman of the People's Republic of China appointing you as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. I wish to express, in my own name and in the name of the Czechoslovak people and the Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, my respect to Comrade Chairman of the People's Republic of China, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the fraternal Chinese people.

First of all, I want to emphasize how much the Czechoslovak people respect the deep friendship and brotherhood between them and the great Chinese people. Sincere cooperation, mutual support, and joint unremitting efforts to contribute to the cause of peace and to resolutely curb the threats and aggression of the enemies of peace are the fundamental characteristics of our friendship. These efforts are also the foundation for the victories achieved by the world's peaceful and democratic camp, headed by our ally and friend, the great Soviet Union. The Czechoslovak people will continue to support the just struggle of the Chinese people to achieve territorial integrity and the indisputable legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

Naturally, all our people will care about the achievements of your country in construction, which is victoriously building a socialist economy and bringing welfare to the people, as much as they care about their own affairs. We were as delighted as the people of the People's Republic of China were when they adopted their first constitution—a constitution that united the various nationalities of your great motherland into a unified whole with a firm will. Together with the people of all peace-loving countries, we highly appreciate the achievements of your government's foreign policy, which played a significant role in concluding the armistice agreements in Korea and Indochina. It is indeed fortunate for progressive mankind that other Asian countries striving for their own independence can draw enthusiasm and experience from the victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle and the achievements of their creative work. It is indeed fortunate for peace that your government is seeking to reach an understanding with Asian countries in order to establish mutual relations on the lofty principles of friendly cooperation.

Comrade Ambassador, since the liberation of your heroic and glorious country, our growing economic and cultural relations have reached an unprecedented scale, bringing our two peoples closer together than at any time in their history. The Czechoslovak people still warmly hope that this fraternal friendship and cooperation will be further expanded and strengthened. Therefore, I can assure you that your efforts to further strengthen and comprehensively develop the friendly relations between the Czechoslovak Republic and the People's Republic of China will receive the full support of myself personally, as well as the entire Czechoslovak government and all Czechs and Slovaks.

I extend a warm welcome to you, Comrade Ambassador, and wish you many achievements in carrying out your mission.

    曹瑛大使的颂词敬爱的总统同志：
    我怀着极愉快的心情，向您呈递中华人民共和国主席任命我为驻捷克斯洛伐克共和国特命全权大使的国书。
    总统同志，在向您呈递国书的时候，请让我代表中华人民共和国主席、中华人民共和国政府和全体中国人民向您，并通过您，向兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民致最诚挚的敬意。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民，在捷克斯洛伐克共产党的领导下和苏联的无私援助下，在巩固人民民主制度和建设社会主义方面已获得了巨大的成就。第一个五年经济建设计划的胜利完成，已大大加强了捷克斯洛伐克的经济力量，并为大力发展农业和提高劳动人民的生活水平创造了必要的条件。最近，捷克斯洛伐克国民议会和斯洛伐克民族议会选举的巨大胜利，充分证明了捷克斯洛伐克各族人民的亲密的团结。捷克斯洛伐克人民在辛勤地进行和平建设的同时，一贯地关心保卫和巩固世界和平的事业，为和缓国际紧张局势、反对帝国主义战争政策进行着不懈的斗争。中国人民为捷克斯洛伐克人民在建设社会主义和维护世界和平的伟大事业上所取得的卓越成就而感到欢欣鼓舞。总统同志，五年来，我们两国人民互相关怀，互相支持，已经牢固地建立了真诚的兄弟友谊和密切的合作关系。随着两国社会主义建设事业的推进，我们的经济合作和文化交流正一天比一天扩大。为了两国人民的繁荣和幸福，我们两国人民的友谊和合作必将日益巩固和发展。
    总统同志，我向您保证：在我担任中华人民共和国驻捷克斯洛伐克共和国大使职务的期间，我将为巩固和发展中捷两国人民间的友好合作关系而贡献出一切力量。我深信：我在执行这一重要的任务时，将获得您和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府的帮助和支持。萨波托斯基总统的答词大使同志：
    我非常愉快地接受中华人民共和国主席同志任命您为特命全权大使的国书。我愿以我个人的名义、以捷克斯洛伐克人民和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府的名义，向中华人民共和国主席同志、中华人民共和国政府和兄弟般的中国人民表示敬意。
    首先，我要强调说明捷克斯洛伐克人民是多么尊重他们同伟大的中国人民之间的深厚的友谊和兄弟情谊。真诚的合作关系、相互的支持以及为了对和平事业作出贡献和坚决制止和平的敌人的威胁和侵略而作的共同的不懈的努力是我们的友谊的基本特点。这些努力也是以我们的盟国和朋友伟大的苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营所取得的胜利的基础。捷克斯洛伐克人民将继续支持中国人民为实现领土完整和中华人民共和国在联合国组织中的不容争论的合法权利而进行的正义斗争。
    自然，我们全体人民将像关心他们自己的事业一样关心正在胜利地建设社会主义经济和给人民带来福利的你们的国家在建设方面的成就。我们像中华人民共和国人民通过他们的第一部宪法时一样感到欢欣鼓舞——这部宪法用坚决的意志把你们伟大的祖国的各个民族团结成为一个统一的整体。我们同所有爱好和平的国家的人民一起，对于在缔结朝鲜和印度支那停战协定方面起了重大作用的你们的政府的外交政策的成就给予很高的评价。正在争取自己的独立的其他亚洲国家也能够从中国人民的解放斗争的胜利和他们的创造性工作的成就中吸取热情和经验，这对于进步人类来说的确是幸运的。你们的政府正在设法同亚洲各国取得谅解，以便在崇高的友好合作的原则的基础上建立相互关系，这对于和平来说的确是幸运的。
    大使同志，自从你们的英雄的、光荣的国家获得解放以来，我们相互间的日益增长的经济和文化关系已经达到空前的规模，已经使我们两国人民比他们的历史上任何时候更加接近了。捷克斯洛伐克人民仍然热烈希望这种兄弟般的友谊和合作将得到进一步的扩大和加强。因此我可以向您保证，您为了进一步加强和全面发展捷克斯洛伐克共和国同中华人民共和国两国间的友好关系而作的努力，将得到我个人以及整个捷克斯洛伐克政府和全体捷克人和斯洛伐克人的充分支持。
    我对您，大使同志，来到这里表示热忱的欢迎，并祝您在执行您的使命中取得许多成就。
