Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th: Over 1,300 representatives from all circles in Fujian Province and Fuzhou City gathered on the 18th to oppose the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty."

    Zeng Jingbing, Deputy Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, pointed out sternly at the meeting that the "treaty" signed by US imperialism with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a thoroughly aggressive war treaty, and this "treaty" threatens the security of our country and the 13 million people of Fujian Province. The people of Fujian Province will never allow US imperialism to collude with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to undermine our peaceful construction. The people of the province must unite closely, work hard to increase production and practice economy, overcome all difficulties, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Chen Shaokuan, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, denounced the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" as a deed by which the traitor Chiang sells Taiwan, and a written confession by US imperialism of its aggression against Taiwan. He said: People in Taiwan should now understand that if they do not want to be eternal sinners of the nation, they should abandon the darkness and turn to the light as soon as possible. Lin Zhuguang, a representative of returned overseas Chinese, said: "Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek clique is the urgent desire of 12 million overseas Chinese. Now that US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique have signed a 'treaty' in an attempt to occupy Taiwan for a long time, we overseas Chinese resolutely oppose it. We will strengthen unity, display patriotic enthusiasm, and work with the people of the whole country to actively support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan!"

    Zheng Yimu, a model agricultural laborer in Fujian Province, said angrily at the meeting: "We must work hard to produce more grain so that the People's Liberation Army can eat their fill, train well, and liberate Taiwan as soon as possible." Wu Lizhen, representative of various people's organizations in Fujian Province and Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Fujian Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, said: "We will always remember the facts that under the direct instigation of US imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's planes bombed Fujian cities, harassed the coast, and arrested fishermen and robbed fishing boats, causing many mothers to lose their sons and many wives to lose their husbands. We must actively support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan."

    Huang Fuguan, a model industrial laborer in Fuzhou City, representatives of various democratic parties' local organizations in Fujian Province, Liu Tong, the person in charge of the Fujian Provincial Local Organization of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Lu Weite, a representative of the education sector, also spoke at the meeting. They all unanimously expressed that they would do their jobs well and take practical actions to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and give a resolute rebuff to the war provocations of the aggressors.

    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th: The representatives from all circles in Fujian Province and Fuzhou City held a meeting on the 18th to oppose the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," and passed a resolution on supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, resolutely opposing the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," and being determined to liberate Taiwan. The resolution stated: We will never forget the disasters brought to the people of Fujian by US imperialism's occupation of Taiwan. Under the protection of US imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which fled the Chinese mainland, still occupies Taiwan and our coastal islands such as Jinmen and Matsu; with the support and direction of the US Navy and Air Force, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique carries out gangster-style harassment on the coast, plundering and robbing our fishing boats and merchant ships, indiscriminately bombing and killing our peaceful residents, and US-Chiang spies and secret agents continue to infiltrate our coastal areas to carry out various conspiracies and sabotage activities. Fujian is at the forefront of the Southeast coastal defense. If Taiwan is not liberated, the people of Fujian will never have peace.

    The resolution concluded: The people of Fujian Province have full confidence in completing the glorious historical task of liberating Taiwan together with the people of the whole country! The people of Fujian Province bear extremely important and glorious responsibility in the struggle to liberate Taiwan. We must unite more closely, strengthen all aspects of our work, heighten revolutionary vigilance, work hard to increase industrial and agricultural production, practice strict economy, overcome difficulties, complete the national construction plan, actively support the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and strive to liberate Taiwan and all enemy-occupied islands, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, complete the great cause of the liberation of the Chinese people, and defend Asian and world peace!

    福建各界代表集会反对美蒋条约
    大会通过拥护周外长声明的决议
    【新华社福州十九日电】福建省、福州市各界代表一千三百多人十八日集会反对美蒋“共同防御条约”。
    中国共产党福建省委员会副书记曾镜冰在会上严正地指出：美帝国主义同蒋介石卖国集团签订的“条约”，是一个彻头彻尾的侵略性的战争条约，这个“条约”威胁着我国和福建省一千三百万人民的安全。福建省人民决不允许美帝国主义勾结蒋介石卖国集团来破坏我们的和平建设，全省人民要紧密团结，努力增产节约，克服一切困难支援解放军解放台湾。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会福建省分会主席陈绍宽痛斥美蒋“共同防御条约”是蒋贼出卖台湾的文契，是美帝国主义侵略台湾的亲笔供状。他说：在台湾的人们现在应该明白，如果不愿做国家民族千古的罪人，应早日弃暗投明。归国华侨代表林珠光说：“解放台湾，消灭蒋贼集团是国外一千二百万华侨的迫切愿望，现在美帝国主义与蒋介石卖国集团签订‘条约’企图长期侵占台湾，我们华侨坚决反对，我们将加强团结，发挥爱国热情，与全国人民一起，积极支援人民解放军解放台湾！”
    福建省农业劳动模范郑依牳在会上愤怒地说：“我们要努力增产更多的粮食，让人民解放军吃饱饭、练好兵，早日解放台湾。”各人民团体福建省地方组织代表、福建省民主妇女联合会筹备委员会副主任吴利珍说：“我们永远记得在美帝国主义直接指使下，蒋介石卖国集团飞机轰炸福建城市、骚扰沿海，抓渔民劫渔船，使多少母亲失去儿子，使多少妻子失去丈夫的事实。我们一定要积极支援人民解放军解放台湾。”
    在会上发言的还有福州市工业劳动模范黄福官、各民主党派福建省地方组织代表、中国国民党革命委员会福建省地方组织负责人刘通、教育界代表陆维特等，他们都一致表示要做好各项工作，以实际行动支援解放军解放台湾，给侵略者的战争挑衅以坚决的回击。
    【新华社福州十九日电】福建省、福州市各界代表十八日召开反对美蒋“共同防御条约”大会，通过了关于拥护周外长声明、坚决反对美蒋“共同防御条约”、一定要解放台湾的决议。决议中说：我们永远不会忘记由于美帝国主义霸占台湾给福建人民带来的灾难。在美帝国主义庇护下，逃离中国大陆的蒋介石卖国集团还窃踞在台湾和我省金门、马祖等沿海岛屿；在美国海、空军支持并指使下，蒋介石卖国集团在沿海进行强盗式骚扰，掠夺抢劫我渔船、商船，滥炸残杀我和平居民，美蒋间谍特务还不断潜入我沿海地区进行种种阴谋破坏活动。福建处在东南海防最前线，台湾不解放，福建人民便永无宁日。
    决议最后说：福建全省人民有充分信心和全国人民一道，共同完成解放台湾的光荣的历史任务！我们福建全省人民在解放台湾斗争中，负有极其重大的光荣责任，我们一定要更加紧密团结一致，加强各方面工作，提高革命警惕，努力增加工农业生产，厉行节约，克服困难，完成国家建设计划，积极支援中国人民解放军，为解放台湾及一切敌占岛屿，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，完成中国人民解放大业，保卫亚洲和世界和平而奋斗！
