    New Residential Area in Bengbu City
    In order to protect residents on the banks of the Huai River from the threat of flooding, the Bengbu Municipal People's Government and the Huai River Harnessing Committee are helping residents relocate to "Diaoyutai," located eight li from Bengbu City. Residents from areas such as Sanma Road and Huachang Street began relocating in early November, and more than 400 households have already moved into their new homes. The housing built by the Transport Workers' Union has completed half of its planned construction, and workers' families are expected to move into the new houses before the New Year, accommodating an estimated 1,000 households.
    This residential area has a clean and orderly environment. Rows of new houses stand side by side, with over a dozen flat streets in between. Newly built modern wells and toilets are spaced at regular intervals, and there is a wide road leading directly to the center of Bengbu City, facilitating travel for people.
    Along with the construction of the new residences, schools and cooperatives are being established.

    蚌埠市新建住宅区
    蚌埠市人民政府、治淮委员会为使淮堤边上的居民不再遭受淮水威胁，正帮助居民迁到离蚌埠市八里路的“钓鱼台”居住。十一月初，三马路、华昌街等一带居民已开始迁移，现在已有四百多户搬进新家。搬运工会盖的房屋已完成计划数的一半，新年以前，工人家属就要搬进新屋，预计可住一千多户居民。
    这片住宅环境清洁、整齐，一幢幢的新房并排齐立，中间有十几条平坦的街道，相隔一定的距离就有新建的新式井和厕所，还有直通蚌埠市中心的一条宽阔马路，便利人们来往。
    随着新宅的建成，学校、合作社等正在设立。
