András Hegedüs' Speech at the European Conference on December 1st

Dear Comrades!

First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Hungarian government, to express our gratitude to the Soviet government: it is thanks to its proposal to guarantee European peace and to convene this conference that European countries have the opportunity to discuss the issue of European collective security.

The Hungarian people, who have always dedicated themselves to the struggle for peace, felt great hope upon receiving the news of the conference, because they believed that it would help eliminate the danger of war threatening the Hungarian people and would promote a peaceful resolution to the German question.

The Soviet Union's proposal for a draft treaty on European collective security at the Berlin Conference has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Hungarian people—workers, peasants, and intellectuals. The Hungarian people had hoped that the governments of European countries, considering the vital interests of their own people, would understand the danger of reviving German militarism and would therefore agree to the principle of European collective security, thereby demonstrating their sincere desire for peace.

The Hungarian government believes that the all-European treaty draft proposed by the Soviet Union to guarantee European collective security is the most realistic basis for establishing a European collective security system. All European countries, regardless of their social system, can participate in this treaty on an equal footing. Before the establishment of a unified, peaceful Germany, both the German Democratic Republic and the German Federal Republic can participate in this treaty.

Since the Berlin Conference, the idea of collective security has been met with increasingly broad and positive responses from people across Europe, even from government officials in many countries that did not participate in the Berlin Conference. More and more people recognize the correctness of this idea and the necessity of realizing it. But regrettably, some powerful figures, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom and France which follow it, not only believe that there is no need to discuss the Soviet proposal, but also do not put forward any proposals on the issue of establishing a European collective security system; instead, they concluded the Paris Agreements and want to force their rapid ratification, thus seriously threatening the security of the European people.

The open desire to revive German militarism and maintain military tension is reflected in the U.S. note of November 29th, which states that the U.S. government is fully determined to put the Paris Agreements into effect as quickly as possible and that it does not intend to abandon this path.

However, the current position of the countries that did not participate in this conference cannot allow us to even temporarily remove the issue of European collective security from the agenda. On the contrary, for the sake of the interests of the people of all countries, further resolute measures should be taken immediately to establish collective security and prevent the threat from Germany. The Hungarian government believes that this conference and its resolutions can make the responsible persons of the relevant countries clearly understand the extent of the threat to their countries and understand their responsibilities.

On behalf of the government of the Hungarian People's Republic, I can declare that the Hungarian people are ready to actively work, according to the Soviet proposals, to guarantee the security of Europe, because they know clearly from their own experience that the revival of German militarism and its accession to aggressive military blocs is a threat to our country, and they know that the effective defense against this is to establish a European collective security system.

Throughout their thousand-year history, the Hungarian people have constantly struggled against Germany's ambitions for domination. For the past four hundred years, until our liberation in 1945, the Hungarian people were almost continuously under the oppression of Germany and Austria.

Foreign enslavers used terror to bind the spiritual life of Hungary, obstructed the development of Hungarian national culture through forced Germanization, and even prohibited the use of the Hungarian language for a long time.

In the last fifty years, the Hungarian people have twice been forced, within one generation, into bloody wars for Germany's ambition to seize hegemony. The First World War sacrificed countless manpower and material resources. One out of every forty people in the country became a victim of the war.

After the First World War, the Horthy fascist regime, which came to power, sold out the interests of the Hungarian people and colluded with German fascists in order to maintain its anti-people rule.

After Hitler came to power, Hungary's colonial dependence deepened year by year during the preparation for the Second World War. Fascist Germany controlled Hungary's economy more and more tightly through foreign trade. In addition to controlling Hungary's foreign trade, German economic aggression also began to penetrate into all sectors of the Hungarian national economy. German monopoly capitalists seized Hungary's most important raw material production areas. Ninety-six percent of Hungary's bauxite was shipped to Germany, where it was processed into aluminum. Hungarian residents had to buy products made from Hungarian bauxite at prices several times higher. Important positions in many industrial sectors in Hungary were occupied by German trusts and their branches in Hungary. Several large German banks dominated Hungary's credit business and controlled Hungarian banks.

As a result of the forced annexation of Austria in 1938, German troops reached the Hungarian border. The German-Austrian merger deepened Hungary's political and economic dependence.

Hungary's economic difficulties became increasingly serious because fascist Germany imposed a huge military burden on the Hungarian people in preparing for war. The Hungarian ruling class, serving the German ambitious, forced them to participate in various military adventures on the side of the aggressive Berlin-Rome "Axis," against the will of the Hungarian people, and later forced them to participate in the Second World War. Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians were sent to the battlefield to die for German imperialism: one in twenty Hungarian citizens lost their lives for Germany's ambition to seize hegemony. It can be said with certainty that not a single family in Hungary was spared from this or that disaster during the Second World War.

During the Second World War, the increasingly rampant policy of terror, the increasing burden of war, and the plunder of the country aroused great anger among the Hungarian people, so that in the spring of 1944, German fascists could no longer trust the stability of their ally Horthy's regime, so with the consent of their lackeys in Hungary, they personally occupied Hungary. In this way, Hungary lost even its superficial independence and became a victim of the terror of German fascist lackeys.

As a result of the German occupation and the war waged for the interests of German imperialism, 40.2 percent of Hungary's national property was destroyed. The war loss equaled seven years of national income. Industrial production fell to 30 percent of the pre-war level, and the wheat cultivation area fell to 45 percent of the pre-war level. The property plundered by German and Hungarian fascists was also enormous. Eighty-five percent of the country's trains, ninety-six percent of the cars, eighty percent of the horses, forty percent of the cattle, and the equipment of 405 industrial enterprises were looted to the West. Many treasures and antiquities in Hungary's national culture were destroyed. In addition, a large part of Hungary's national treasures and valuable cultural property were looted to the West.

Our liberator, the Soviet army, opened a path to a new life, development, and national independence for the Hungarian people, who suffered great bloodshed, were plundered, and humiliated.

Since liberation, Hungary has gone through a long path of development. Immediately after liberation, the dream of Hungarian peasants for generations was realized: the land became the property of millions of suffering peasants. The Hungarian working class enthusiastically set about restoring the country, and they not only healed the wounds of war, but also built many new industrial enterprises. The Hungarian people have taken control of all the property in the country, using all the wealth on Hungarian land to benefit all the people. Cultural achievements have changed from the privilege of a few to the property of all the people.

The Hungarian working class, peasants, and intellectuals are today enthusiastically working hard because they know that the fruits of their labor belong to them. A powerful movement for national unity has been launched in our country, with people from all walks of life in Hungary, including workers, peasants, and intellectuals, participating side by side. The recent elections of local conferences have proved that the Hungarian people are unprecedentedly united, and they are implementing the government's program aimed at guaranteeing peace and meeting the growing material and cultural needs of all residents.

The greatest desire of every citizen of our country, of the entire Hungarian people, is to consolidate and further develop the achievements that have been made. The foreign policy of the Hungarian People's Republic proceeds from these tasks.

Historical lessons teach us that disputes between countries hinder progress. In the Danube region and other parts of Europe, the cause of justice has more than once suffered disaster because of conflicts between countries. Based on this important historical lesson, we are very pleased to have first established friendly relations with the Soviet people and the people of other fraternal countries who extended assistance to the Hungarian people after liberation. The cooperation that has been established between Hungary and various friendly countries, especially between Hungary and the Soviet Union, in the past ten years, is the most decisive factor in guaranteeing all the achievements made by the Hungarian people in building their own motherland and building a people's Hungary.

Based on this friendly relationship, the Hungarian People's Republic and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics signed a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance. Our country has also signed similar treaties with other people's democratic countries.

The characteristic of the entire foreign policy of our government is, on the one hand, to continuously strengthen the friendly relations that have already been formed with these countries, and on the other hand, to strive to establish normal and good relations with other countries. Therefore, our country has established normal relations with our neighbor Yugoslavia, concluded many important agreements with it, and intends to do so in the future. We also want to restore normal good-neighborly relations with Austria. Achievements have also been made in this regard. We are conducting trade with almost all countries in the world. Our cultural ties have expanded.

The entire diplomatic activity of the Hungarian People's Republic has consistently been dedicated to: peaceful and friendly coexistence with all countries and all peoples in the world, with full respect for each other's interests. However, the failure to resolve the German and Austrian questions and the conspiracy to revive German imperialism threatens this fundamental goal of our foreign policy and threatens our country's security.

After the Second World War, the Hungarian people believed that the guarantee of preventing war destruction was that the victorious great powers stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement that the rearmament of Germany was prohibited. The Hungarian people and peace-loving people all over the world are disappointed that the Western occupation countries, especially the United States, not only do not implement the decision to eliminate the armed forces and military potential of West Germany, but, in order to prepare for their own war plans, even cancel step by step the restrictions they have imposed themselves. The Hungarian people are watching with great anxiety the danger of the revival of German militarism increasing year by year. The Bonn state was established in September 1949, and in 1951, the restrictions on West German heavy industry were officially lifted, and even the controls on West German heavy industry were lifted. The Western occupation countries agreed to the Adenauer government to establish the basis of new West German troops in the name of various groups, comrade associations, border police brigades, etc., and this army was led by war criminals, former German Wehrmacht and SS generals and officers. Everyone knows that German military enterprises, which were notorious in the two world wars, are now back in operation, and are even producing poison gas and other weapons of mass destruction. Western government officials, together with the United States, even use war criminals and fascists from Hungary and other countries to establish sabotage organizations to oppose the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries—including Hungary.

German imperialism, which has caused Hungary untold suffering, is active again, and those monopoly groups that used to oppress and exploit the Hungarian people are now guiding West Germany's revanchist policies. Schacht, a well-known representative of German monopoly enterprises and one of the main economic leaders of fascist Germany in the past, said very timely: "The time when we can pass from Sarajevo to Japan has come again."

What is particularly dangerous to the Hungarian people is that German imperialists are attempting to forcibly annex Austria economically, politically, and militarily. Since the establishment of the Bonn government, the plan to annex Austria has expanded and has taken on concrete forms. West German monopoly capitalists, in collusion with the U.S. government, are trying to dominate Austria's industry.

West Germany's economic aggression against Austria is manifested primarily in: West German monopoly enterprises demanding the return of property nationalized after the war. Once this goal is achieved, they will seize 100% of Austria's steel production, 100% of copper and tin production, 90% of aluminum production, and 95% of coal production. We feel that these figures do not need further comment.

Many leading politicians and ministers in the Bonn government have repeatedly stated in their speeches that all territories that previously belonged to Germany are still considered an integral part of Germany. Kaiser, the Bonn government's "Minister for All-German Affairs," said that a true Europe is possible only after the genuine restoration of the German group; he also pointed out that the first country that should participate in this group is Austria.

It is intriguing that not long ago, the Bonn Supreme Court used a simple decision to declare 75,000 Austrian citizens now residing in West Germany as German citizens.

Many newspapers in Western Europe wrote that Bonn has formulated a plan to establish the Austrian army, and the Bonn government's "War Minister" has proposed suggestions on preparing to establish the Austrian army, and he also made suggestions on how the military committee in Vienna, led by Austrian Deputy Minister Graf, should cooperate with the Bonn "War Department."

Countless fascist organizations that advocate the need to merge the "unviable" Austria with the Bonn Republic are openly operating in Austria with the permission and support of the Austrian government and the Western occupation authorities in Austria.

The Hungarian people clearly see how much danger the Hungarian people would suffer if its neighbor were directly adjacent to aggressive German militarism.

The Hungarian government believes that it is its responsibility to the people to strive to protect the independence of its country and to guarantee peace. Therefore, it opposes the Bonn Agreements, and therefore it believes that the establishment of the German Democratic Republic is of great significance.

The Hungarian people are watching with increasing trust and sympathy the resolute struggle of the government of the German Democratic Republic and the people against the revival of German militarism, and the efforts of the German Democratic Republic to peacefully unify Germany. For the Hungarian people, the establishment of the German Democratic Republic first proves that there are huge democratic forces in this country, and the purpose of this democratic force is to establish a unified, peaceful Germany. Therefore, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic fully supports the statement of the government of the German Democratic Republic on November 19, 1954, which contains specific proposals for resolving the German question.

The Hungarian people are delighted to see that the Soviet proposals on European collective security can not only be used to eliminate the dangers caused by the re-militarization of Germany, but also point out the correct path to peacefully resolving the entire German question.

The Hungarian government fully agrees with what Comrade Molotov pointed out in his speech, that the peaceful resolution of the German question and the establishment of a European collective security system are closely linked. It is now clear that if the European countries had agreed to the Soviet Union's advocacy of collective security and the indivisibility of peace in the period before the Second World War, they would have been able to avoid the terrible disasters caused by German militarism.

The Hungarian people are deeply convinced that the Soviet Union's position on collective security and the acceptance of the Soviet proposals on this issue can enable Hungary, located in the heart of Europe, to continue its constructive work in an environment of peace and security.

The Soviet Union's efforts and initiatives in safeguarding the interests of European countries have further strengthened the trust and love of the entire Hungarian people for the Soviet Union.

The greatest desire of the Hungarian people is to participate in and actively support everyone's great efforts under the leadership of the Soviet Union to maintain peace and prevent the threat of German militarism.

Establishing a European collective security system and establishing a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany within its scope will reduce the burden of arms expansion on the European people. At the same time, the establishment of such a security system will facilitate the Hungarian people to continue their constructive peaceful labor, because with this security system, the Hungarian people do not have to greatly strengthen their national defense forces. However, based on historical experience, if West Germany re-arms, the Hungarian people must greatly strengthen their national defense forces.

Establishing a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany can also guarantee the further development of economic and cultural ties between the German and Hungarian peoples on a basis that is beneficial to the German and Hungarian peoples, but arming West Germany will cause distrust, friction, and tension in Europe, which will make it almost impossible to even maintain the current relations between the Hungarian and German peoples (the current relations are still far from satisfactory).

The Hungarian people strive to solve the Austrian question within the framework of the European collective security system. The existence of a democratic Austria that is no longer in danger of a new German-Austrian merger will pave the way for the development of mutual economic and cultural relations between Austria and Hungary, which are determined by objective needs. In short, taking this path makes it possible to establish truly good-neighborly relations between the two countries in accordance with the interests of the Austrian and Hungarian peoples.

It is precisely for these reasons that the government of the Hungarian People's Republic supports the Soviet proposals on establishing a European collective security system and convening an all-European conference, and it is also because of this that the Hungarian government opposes all conspiracies to revive German militarism, establish a revanchist West German army, and arm these armies with atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

The delegation of the Hungarian People's Republic fully agrees with Comrade Molotov's assessment of the current European situation. Our delegation also agrees with the view that ratifying the Paris Agreements means a further deepening of the danger of war and will create a new situation in Europe. If the Paris Agreements are ratified, then the peace-loving countries attending this conference must take resolute practical steps to defend their own security and take common measures in organizing their armed forces and establishing a common command.

Those countries whose borders are directly threatened by the reviving German militarism, such as the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, and the German Democratic Republic, in addition to the common measures taken by all participating countries of this conference, must also formulate and implement their own separate measures to defend their borders based on their own circumstances, which we believe is reasonable and necessary.

The government of the Hungarian People's Republic believes that the ratification of the Paris Agreements is a serious threat to our country, and therefore it firmly states that it will take the necessary measures to strengthen its own defense capabilities, including military measures, in close cooperation with the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries.

The government of the Hungarian People's Republic is willing to do everything possible to eliminate the danger of another devastating war and promote the establishment of a security system that can guarantee the peace of the people of all European countries.

Starting from its own historical lessons and from the pressing task of prospering its own country, the Hungarian people resolutely oppose the revival of German militarism and oppose preparing for a new war.

The people and government of the Hungarian People's Republic want peace. Both the old generation in our country, who have experienced many trials, and the growing young generation, all jointly demand peace.

We want peace. Precisely because of this, we resolutely oppose with all our strength the resurgence of German aggression, because this is the greatest threat to our peace.

The delegation of the Hungarian government will do everything possible to ensure the success of the conference, and on behalf of the entire Hungarian people, it expresses: Hungary is prepared to do everything possible to fight to defend peace.

### 十二月一日在欧洲会议上  安德拉希·赫格居斯的发言

    十二月一日在欧洲会议上
    安德拉希·赫格居斯的发言敬爱的同志们！
    首先请允许我代表匈牙利政府向苏联政府表示感谢：由于它提出保障欧洲和平的建议和召开这次会议，欧洲国家才有可能来讨论欧洲集体安全问题。
    始终献身于和平斗争的匈牙利人民在得到关于召开会议的消息的时候，产生了极大的期望，因为他们相信，这次会议将有助于消除威胁着匈牙利人民的战争危险，并将促使德国问题得到和平解决。
    苏联在柏林会议上提出的关于欧洲集体安全条约草案的建议受到匈牙利广大人民——工人、农民和知识分子十分热烈的欢迎。匈牙利人民曾期望，欧洲国家的政府为自己人民的切身利益考虑，理解到复活德国军国主义的危险，因此同意欧洲集体安全的主张，从而表明自己要求和平的真诚愿望。
    匈牙利政府认为苏联提出的保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约草案是建立欧洲集体安全体系的最现实的基础。一切欧洲国家，不问它的社会制度如何，都可以在平等的基础上参加这一条约，在统一、和平的德国建立以前，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国都可以参加这一条约。
    自从柏林会议召开以来，集体安全的思想得到欧洲各国越来越广泛的人士、甚至于许多没有参加柏林会议的国家的政府人士的良好的反应，越来越多的人承认这一思想的正确性和实现它的必要性。但是遗憾的是，一些有权势的人士、特别是美国以及追随它的英国和法国的一些有权势的人士不但认为不需要讨论苏联的建议，甚至对建立欧洲集体安全体系问题也不提出任何建议；他们反而缔结巴黎协定并且要强迫迅速批准巴黎协定，因而使欧洲人民的安全受到严重的威胁。
    在美国十一月二十九日的覆照中反映出了要复活德国军国主义和保持军事紧张局势的公开的愿望，覆照说，美国政府方面对尽可能快地使巴黎协定生效是抱有充分决心的，并说它不打算放弃这条道路。
    但是，没有参加这次会议的国家现在的立场不能使我们那怕是暂时把欧洲集体安全问题从日程上勾去。相反地，为各国人民的利益着想就应该立刻采取进一步的坚决措施，来建立集体安全和防止德国的威胁。匈牙利政府认为，这次会议和它的决议可以使有关国家的负责人士明确理解到他们国家所受的威胁的程度，理解到自己的责任。
    我代表匈牙利人民共和国政府可以声明，匈牙利人民准备根据苏联的建议积极努力来保障欧洲的安全，因为他们根据自己的经验清楚地知道，德国军国主义的复活以及它的加入侵略性的军事集团，就是对我们国家的威胁，他们知道，在这方面的有效的防卫办法就是建立欧洲集体安全体系。
    匈牙利人民在一千年来的历史中，曾不断地对德国的统治野心进行斗争。最近四百年来，直到一九四五年我国解放时为止，匈牙利人民几乎一直处在德国和奥地利的压迫下。
    外国的奴役者以恐怖手段来束缚匈牙利的精神生活，用强迫日尔曼化的办法来阻挠匈牙利民族文化的发展，甚至于长时期以来禁止使用匈牙利文。
    最近五十年来，匈牙利人民在一代之间曾两次被迫为德国夺取霸权的野心来进行流血战争。第一次世界大战就牺牲了无数的人力和物力。国内每四十个人中就有一个人成为战争的牺牲者。
    第一次世界大战以后，取得统治权的霍尔梯法西斯政权出卖了匈牙利人民的利益，为了维持自己的反人民的统治而同德国法西斯勾结在一起。
    当希特勒取得政权之后，在准备第二次世界大战期间，匈牙利的殖民地依赖性一年一年地加深。法西斯德国通过对外贸易越来越紧地控制了匈牙利的经济。除去控制匈牙利的对外贸易以外，德国的经济侵略还开始深入到匈牙利国民经济的各个部门。德国垄断资本家把匈牙利的最重要的原料产地攫为己有。匈牙利的百分之九十六的铝土矿砂被运到德国去了，在那里加工成为铝。匈牙利居民不得不以高好几倍的价格去购买用匈牙利的铝土矿做成的产品。匈牙利许多工业部门中的重要地盘都被德国托辣斯及它们在匈牙利的分公司占据了。德国几家大银行在匈牙利的信贷事业中占统治地位，并且控制了匈牙利的银行。
      一九三八年强迫合并奥地利的结果，德国军队到了匈牙利边境。德奥合并加深了匈牙利的政治上和经济上的依赖性。
    由于法西斯德国在准备战争中将巨大的军备负担加在匈牙利人民身上，匈牙利的经济困难愈来愈严重。为德国野心家服务的匈牙利统治阶级违反匈牙利人民的意志，强迫他们站在侵略性的柏林—罗马“轴心国”一边参加各种军事冒险，后来又强迫他们参加第二次世界大战。数十万匈牙利人被派到战场上去为德国帝国主义送死：匈牙利有二十分之
  一的公民为德国攫取霸权的野心事业断送了性命。可以肯定地说，匈牙利没有一个家庭在第二次世界大战中没有受到这种或那种灾害。
    在第二次世界大战期间，日益猖獗的恐怖政策，日益加重的战争负担和国家所遭到的掠夺，在匈牙利人民中引起了极大的愤怒，以至一九四四年春季，德国法西斯再也不能相信他们的同盟者霍尔梯的政权的稳固性了，于是在他们在匈牙利的走狗的同意下，亲自来占领了匈牙利。这样，匈牙利就连表面上的独立也丧失了，成为德国法西斯走狗的恐怖下的牺牲品。
    德国占领和为德国帝国主义利益而进行战争的结果，匈牙利百分之四十点二的国民财产被毁灭了。战争损失等于七年的国民收入。工业生产下降到战前水平的百分之三十，小麦耕种面积下降到战前水平的百分之四十五。德国和匈牙利的法西斯分子掠夺走的财产也是十分巨大的。被掠夺到西方去的有全国百分之八十五的列车，百分之九十六的汽车，百分之八十的马，百分之四十的牛，以及四百零五个工业企业的设备。匈牙利国民文化中的许多珍品和古物都被毁灭了。此外，匈牙利的很大一部分国家的珍宝和文化方面的宝贵财产被掠夺到西方去了。
    我们的解放者苏联军队给遭到重大流血牺牲、受到掠夺和屈辱的匈牙利人民开辟了一条走向新生活、发展和民族独立的道路。
    自解放以来，匈牙利走过了漫长的发展道路。一解放，匈牙利农民世世代代的梦想立即就实现了：土地变成了数百万苦难的农民的财产。匈牙利工人阶级以满腔热情着手恢复国家，他们不仅医治好了战争的创伤，而且还建设了许多新的工业企业。匈牙利人民掌握了全国所有的财产，把匈牙利土地上的一切财富用来为全体人民谋福利。文化成就由少数人的特权变成了全体人民的财产。
    匈牙利工人阶级、农民和知识分子今天正在热情奋发地劳动着，因为他们知道，他们劳动的果实是属于他们自己的。在我国展开了一个强大的争取民族大团结的运动，匈牙利的工人、农民、知识分子等各阶层的人民肩并肩地参加了这一运动。最近举行的地方会议的选举证明，匈牙利人民空前地团结起来了，他们正在实现目的在于保障和平和满足全体居民日益增长的物质和文化需要的政府施政纲领。
    我国每一个公民、匈牙利全体人民的最大愿望是巩固和进一步发展已得的成就。匈牙利人民共和国政府的外交政策就是从这些任务出发的。
    历史的教训教导我们，各国之间的纠纷阻碍进步。在多瑙河流域和欧洲的其他部分，正义的事业曾不止一次地遭到灾害，就是由于各国之间发生冲突。根据这一重大的历史教训，我们很愉快地首先同苏联人民以及其他在解放后向匈牙利人民伸出援助之手的其他兄弟国家的人民建立了友好关系。近十年来在匈牙利和各友好的国家之间、首先是在匈牙利和苏联之间建立起来的合作，是保证匈牙利人民在建设自己的祖国、建立人民的匈牙利方面取得一切成就的最具有决定意义的因素。
    根据这种友好的关系，匈牙利人民共和国和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟签订了友好、合作和互助条约。我国和其他人民民主国家也签订了类似的条约。
    我国政府的整个外交政策的特点是一方面不断加强同这些国家已经形成的友好关系，一方面致力于同其他国家建立正常的良好关系。因此，我国同我们的邻国南斯拉夫建立了正常的关系，跟它缔结了许多重要的协定，并且今后还打算这样做。我们也想同奥地利恢复正常的善邻关系。在这方面也已获得成绩。我们几乎跟世界所有国家都在进行贸易。我们的文化联系扩大了。
    匈牙利人民共和国的整个外交活动一贯致力于：在充分尊重彼此利益的情况下，同世界一切国家和一切人民和平友好地共处。但是德国和奥地利问题不得解决以及复活德国帝国主义的阴谋威胁着我们的外交政策的这一基本宗旨，威胁着我国的安全。
    第二次世界大战后，匈牙利人民认为防止战争破坏的保证是，战胜国的大国在波茨坦协定中规定禁止重新武装德国。匈牙利人民同全世界爱好和平的人民感到很失望的是：西方占领国家，首先是美国，不仅不执行关于肃清西德的武装力量和军事潜力的决定，反而为了准备自己的战争计划甚至把它自己施行的限制都一步一步地取消了。匈牙利人民极其不安地注视着德国军国主义复活的危险一年比一年增加。在一九四九年九月波恩国家建立起来了，而在一九五一年正式取消了对西德重工业的限制，而且甚至取消了对西德重工业的管制。西方占领国家同意阿登纳政府以各种团体、同志联合会、边境警察大队等等名目来建立新的西德军队的基础，而这支军队则由战犯、前德国国防军和党卫军的将军和军官率领。大家知道，在两次世界大战中臭名远扬的德国军事企业现在又开工了，甚至在生产毒瓦斯和其他大规模毁灭性武器。西方政府人士和美国一同甚至用匈牙利及其他国家的战犯和法西斯分子去建立破坏组织，以反对苏联、人民民主国家——其中包括匈牙利。
    使匈牙利遭受无比苦难的德国帝国主义又活跃起来了，而过去压迫和剥削匈牙利人民的那些垄断集团现在又在指导西德的复仇主义政策。德国垄断企业的有名代表沙赫特过去是法西斯德国主要经济领导者之一，他自认为很及时地说道：“我们能够从萨拉耶夫通往日本的时机又到了。”
    对匈牙利人民特别危险的是：德国帝国主义者企图在经济上、政治上和军事上强力并吞奥地利。自从波恩政府建立以后，要并吞奥地利的计划扩大了，并且已具有具体的形式。西德垄断资本家勾结美国政府力图在奥地利的工业中占统治地位。
    西德对奥地利进行的经济侵犯首先表现为：西德垄断企业要求发还战后收归国有的财产。一旦达到这个目的，他们就会攫取到百分之百的奥地利钢铁生产，百分之百的铜、锡生产，百分之九十的铝生产和百分之九十五的煤生产。我们觉得，这些数字是用不着再加注释的。
    波恩政府的许多居领导地位的政治家和部长在他们的言论中一再谈到：以前属于德国的所有领土现在仍然被认为是德国不可分割的部分。波恩政府“全德事务部”部长凯撒说，只有真正恢复德国集团以后，真正的欧洲才有可能实现；他同时指出，应该参加这个集团的国家第一个就是奥地利。
    不久以前，波恩最高法院用一个简单的决定宣布现在居住西德的七万五千名奥地利公民为德国公民，这桩事情是耐人玩味的。
    西欧的许多报纸写道，波恩已制订建立奥地利军队的计划，波恩政府的“战争部长”已经提出关于准备建立奥地利军队的建议，他还就在维也纳由奥地利副部长葛拉夫领导下的军事委员会应该怎样同波恩“战争部”进行合作提出了建议。
    无数鼓吹必须使“无生存能力的”奥地利同波恩共和国合并的法西斯组织在奥地利政府和奥地利的西方占领当局的许可和支持下公开地进行活动。
    匈牙利人民清楚地看到，如果它的近邻是和侵略性的德国军国主义直接毗连，匈牙利人民会遭受多大的危险。
    匈牙利政府认为，致力于保护本国的独立和保障和平是它对人民应尽的责任。因此它反对波恩协定，因此它认为德意志民主共和国的成立有重大的意义。
    匈牙利人民怀着越来越大的信任和同情注视着德意志民主共和国的政府和人民为反对复活德国军国主义而进行的坚决的斗争，注视着德意志民主共和国为和平统一德国而作的努力。对匈牙利人民来说，德意志民主共和国的成立首先证明：在这个国家中存在有巨大的民主力量，这支民主力量的目的是建立起统一、和平的德国。因此，匈牙利人民共和国政府完全支持一九五四年十一月十九日德意志民主共和国政府的声明，这个声明包含着解决德国问题的具体建议。
    匈牙利人民欢欣鼓舞地看到：苏联提出的关于欧洲集体安全问题的建议，不仅可以用来消除德国重新军国主义化所造成的危险，同时还指出了和平解决整个德国问题的正确道路。
    匈牙利政府完全同意莫洛托夫同志在他的讲话中所指出的，和平解决德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系是互相密切联系着的。现在已经看得很清楚：欧洲国家如果在第二次世界大战以前的时期同意苏联关于集体安全和和平不可分割的主张，那么它们就能够避免德国军国主义所造成的可怕灾难。
    匈牙利人民深深地相信，苏联在集体安全问题上的立场以及接受苏联就这一问题提出的建议，可以使处在欧洲心脏地带的匈牙利继续在和平和安全的环境里进行自己的建设性工作。
    苏联在保障欧洲各国利益方面所作的努力和提出的倡议更加加强了全体匈牙利人民对苏联的信任和爱戴。
    匈牙利人民的最大愿望就是参加并且积极地支持大家在苏联领导下为维护和平和防止德国军国主义的威胁而作的巨大努力。
    建立欧洲集体安全体系和在它的范围内成立一个统一、民主、和平的德国，将减轻扩军加在欧洲人民身上的负担。同时，建立这样的安全体系就可以便于匈牙利人民继续进行建设性的和平劳动，因为有了这一安全体系，匈牙利人民就不必大力加强国防力量。但是根据历史经验，如果西德重新武装，匈牙利人民就一定必须大力加强国防力量。
    建立一个统一、民主、和平的德国还可以保证在有利于德、匈两国人民的基础上进一步发展德国人民和匈牙利人民之间的经济和文化联系，但是武装西德，就要在欧洲引起不信任、摩擦和紧张局势，就要使得甚至于维持现在的匈、德两国人民的关系（现在的关系还是远远不能令人满意的）都几乎成为不可能。
    匈牙利人民竭力主张在欧洲集体安全体系的范围内解决奥地利问题。一个不再遭到新的德奥合并危险的民主的奥地利的存在，将为发展奥、匈两国客观需要所决定的相互经济和文化关系开辟道路。简单说来，走这条道路，就有可能依照奥地利和匈牙利人民的利益建立两国之间真正睦邻的关系。
    匈牙利人民共和国政府正是根据这些理由，支持苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系和召开全欧会议的建议，也正因为这样，匈牙利政府反对复活德国军国主义、建立复仇主义的西德军队并以原子武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器来武装这些军队的一切阴谋。
    匈牙利人民共和国代表团完全同意莫洛托夫同志对目前欧洲局势所作的估计。我们代表团还同意这样一种看法：批准巴黎协定意味着战争危险进一步加深，并将在欧洲造成新的局势。如果批准巴黎协定，那么出席这次会议的和平国家为了保卫本国的安全就必须采取坚决的实际步骤，在组织它们的武装力量及成立共同的司令部方面采取共同措施。
    国境受到正在复活的德国军国主义直接威胁的那些国家，如波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国和德意志民主共和国等，除了采取这次会议所有参加国采取的共同措施外，还要根据本国的情况，制订和实现本国单独的措施以保卫本国的边境，我们认为这是合理的和必需的。
    匈牙利人民共和国政府认为批准巴黎协定是对我国的严重威胁，因此它坚决表示：要在同苏联及其他爱好和平的国家紧密合作下，采取加强自身防御力量的必要措施，包括军事性质的措施在内。
    匈牙利人民共和国政府愿意竭尽全力来消除另一次毁灭性的战争的危险，促进建立能保证欧洲各国人民和平的安全体系。
    匈牙利人民从自身的历史教训出发，从繁荣本国这一迫切的任务出发，坚决反对复活德国军国主义，反对准备新战争。
    匈牙利人民共和国的人民和政府希望和平。我国经过许多考验的老年一辈和正在成长的青年一辈都共同要求和平。
    我们要和平。正因为如此，我们坚决以全力反对德国侵略再起，因为这是对我国和平的最大的威胁。
    匈牙利政府代表团将竭尽一切力量保证会议的成功，并且代表匈牙利全体人民表示：匈牙利准备竭力为保卫和平而斗争。
