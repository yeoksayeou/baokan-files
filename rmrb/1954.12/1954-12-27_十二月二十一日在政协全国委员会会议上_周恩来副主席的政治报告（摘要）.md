Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delivered a political report at the first session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC on December 21st.

In his report, Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai said: "In the past six months, due to the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and due to the rejection of the 'European Defense Community' treaty by the French National Assembly, the international situation has shown a certain degree of relaxation in both the East and the West.

However, the American aggressor bloc and its followers are not reconciled to the failure of their war policy. They continue to intensify international tensions in the East and the West, striving to expand and deepen the division and split of the world, enslave the local people, and prepare for a new world war."

Vice Chairman Zhou pointed out: The American aggressor bloc and its British and French followers concluded the Paris Agreement in Europe, attempting to deepen the division of Germany and Europe, revive German militarism, and expand the European aggressive system. In the East, the American aggressor bloc and its followers concluded the Manila Treaty, which aims to undermine the Geneva Accords. The United States is actively invading Vietnam, violating the Geneva Accords in all aspects, and trying to turn South Vietnam into its military base. The United States is stepping up the arming of Syngman Rhee's troops in Korea, manipulating the United Nations to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Recently, the United States openly signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, infringing on our country's sovereignty, legalizing the occupation of our territory Taiwan, and turning Taiwan into a military base for the United States to expand its aggression. The United States is also attempting to link this treaty with other aggressive treaties that the United States has instigated and established in the Pacific region, forming an aggressive system for the United States in the East. The US-Chiang treaty is a serious war provocation by the American aggressor bloc against the Chinese people and a major threat to peace in the Far East and Asia. In order to cover up the aggressive nature of the US-Chiang treaty, the United States deliberately created a tense atmosphere, clamored loudly about our country's just sentencing of thirteen American spies, and manipulated the United Nations to pass absurd resolutions to carry out so-called condemnation against our country. The United States is also actively instigating the organization of a Middle East aggressive system, attempting to link the American aggressive systems in the West and the East through this system, forming a large encirclement of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, in order to facilitate its preparation for a new world war.

Vice Chairman Zhou pointed out: Contrary to the American aggressor bloc, both in the East and the West, peace-loving countries have made every effort to seek relaxation of international tensions and safeguard world peace. For nine years, in order to establish a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, in order to oppose the American policy of splitting Europe and establishing military blocs, and in order to establish a European collective security system, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have carried out unremitting struggles. The recent conference of European countries in Moscow further demonstrated the firm determination and great efforts of peace-loving countries to oppose aggression, safeguard peace, and protect their own security. The People's Republic of China resolutely opposes the Paris Agreement and fully supports the eight-nation declaration on European collective security adopted by the Moscow European countries conference. The joint declaration of China and the Soviet Union on October 12 demonstrates the firm determination of China and the Soviet Union to closely cooperate for the consolidation of peace. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China and India, and China and Burma have won the universal support of peace-loving people around the world. The mutual visits of the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma have strengthened the friendly and cooperative relations between China and India, and China and Burma. The joint communiqué recently issued by China and Burma further confirms that the principle of peaceful coexistence has strong vitality. There is no doubt that these actions among peace-loving countries in Asia have made significant contributions to establishing and expanding peace zones and promoting collective peace.

Vice Chairman Zhou solemnly declared: "Taiwan is China's territory, and the Chinese people will never give up until Taiwan is liberated. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the US-Chiang treaty, and no war threat can intimidate the Chinese people in their resolute struggle to defend their national sovereignty and territory. Any absurd proposals for a so-called Taiwan 'independent country,' Taiwan 'neutralization,' and 'trusteeship' of Taiwan are in fact splitting Chinese territory, infringing on Chinese sovereignty, and interfering in Chinese internal affairs, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate. The Chinese people resolutely demand that the United States withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, and stop infringing on China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the United States organizing the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and undermining peace in Indochina; and actively advocate implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and expanding the peace zone. The Chinese people continue to advocate reconvening a conference of relevant countries with the participation of Asian neutral countries to seek the peaceful reunification of Korea, and resolutely oppose the sinister conspiracy of the United States to undermine the Korean armistice agreement and worsen the Korean situation. The Chinese people actively advocate establishing peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries, as long as these countries have the same desire and sincerity."

Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai went on to say that in the past few months, our country has exchanged ambassadors with Albania and developed friendly relations; our country's diplomatic relations with Finland, Norway, the Netherlands and other countries have developed. Negotiations between our country and Afghanistan, Nepal and other countries on the establishment of diplomatic relations have made progress. Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai also pointed out that our country is also conducting negotiations with Yugoslavia on diplomatic relations.

Vice Chairman Zhou emphasized in his report: "During the Geneva Conference, thanks to the efforts of both China and Britain, the relations between the two countries have improved to some extent, which is conducive to world peace. However, recently, the British government has been trying its best to follow the dangerous policies of the American aggressor bloc on some major issues, especially on the issue of American aggression against China's territory Taiwan, the British government has actually supported the so-called 'Mutual Defense Treaty' signed by the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and encouraged the United States to occupy Taiwan. This violates the obligations undertaken by the British government in many solemn international treaties, and has damaged Sino-British relations. The Chinese government cannot but express great regret over this attitude adopted by the British government."

Vice Chairman Zhou expressed his warm support for the statement made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the issue of relations with Japan, and he believed that this statement was conducive to promoting the cause of peace in the Far East and easing international tensions. Vice Chairman Zhou said: "The government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the 600 million Chinese people. The Chinese government has consistently maintained that normal relations should be established with all countries on the basis of observing the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. Our country is willing to establish normal relations with Japan. If the Japanese government can also have the same desire and take corresponding measures, the Chinese government will be prepared to take steps to normalize the relations between China and Japan. The Chinese government advocates extensively developing trade relations with Japan in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and establishing close cultural ties with Japan. In this regard, thanks to the continuous efforts of the people of China and Japan, there have been some achievements, and there will be greater development in the future."

Vice Chairman Zhou emphasized: "The Chinese people have always strived to promote international cooperation, ease international tensions, and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. But we can never tolerate aggression. Only by resisting aggression can we defend peace. The struggle to defend peace is the common struggle of all peace-loving countries and people in the world. Our cause of resisting aggression and defending peace is just. The just cause is invincible. Victory must belong to the people who fight for the just cause!"

Vice Chairman Zhou then said: In order to carry out this great struggle, the people of the whole country need to be more widely mobilized and more firmly united in the future. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as an organization of the people's democratic united front, will continue to play the significant role it played during the period of Resisting America and Aiding Korea in this struggle.

Vice Chairman Zhou said: "The First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercised the functions and powers of the National People's Congress on its behalf, but it itself is not the National People's Congress. Now that the First Session of the National People's Congress has been convened, the role of the political power organ of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercising the functions and powers of the National People's Congress on its behalf has disappeared, but the role of the united front of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference itself still exists. In the past few years, our country's people's democratic united front has been further expanded and developed, and this meeting was convened on the basis of this expansion and development. In the future, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference needs to continue to serve the organization of the people's democratic united front that unites all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic people in the country, and play its due role."

Vice Chairman Zhou pointed out: According to the provisions of the General Program of the "Draft Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," the tasks of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in the future, according to Chairman Mao Zedong's opinion, can be summarized as the following five points: First, to discuss international issues. Second, to negotiate on the list of candidates for representatives to the National People's Congress and representatives to the local people's congresses at the same level, as well as the candidates for the composition of the organizations at all levels of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Third, to assist state organs, promote social forces, resolve issues of mutual relations between classes in social life; and to contact the people and reflect their opinions and suggestions to the relevant state organs. Fourth, to negotiate and handle cooperation issues within the CPPCC and between parties and groups. Fifth, to study Marxism-Leninism and strive for ideological remolding on a voluntary basis.

Vice Chairman Zhou finally said: "According to the above-mentioned five major tasks, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will continue to play its role and fulfill its glorious mission in completing the general task of the state's transition period and in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, specifically, in completing the task of socialist transformation and liberating Taiwan and defending peace."

    十二月二十一日在政协全国委员会会议上
    周恩来副主席的政治报告（摘要）
    【新华社二十六日讯】中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会副主席周恩来十二月二十一日在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议上，作了政治报告。
    周恩来副主席在报告中说：“半年以来，由于朝鲜停战和印度支那恢复和平，由于‘欧洲防务集团’条约在法国国民议会遭到否决，国际局势在东方和西方都出现了一定程度的缓和。
    但是，美国侵略集团和它的追随者却不甘心于他们的战争政策的失败。他们在东方和西方继续加剧国际紧张局势，力谋扩大和加深世界的对立和分裂，奴役当地人民并准备新的世界战争。”
    周副主席指出：美国侵略集团和它的英法追随者在欧洲缔结了巴黎协定，企图加深德国和欧洲的分裂，复活德国军国主义，扩大欧洲侵略体系。在东方美国侵略集团和它的追随者缔结了旨在破坏日内瓦协议的马尼拉条约。美国积极侵入越南，从各方面违反日内瓦协议，力图把南越变为它的军事基地。美国在朝鲜加紧武装李承晚的军队，操纵联合国阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决。最近，美国又公然同蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”，侵犯我国主权，使强占我国领土台湾合法化，并将台湾变为美国扩大侵略的军事基地。美国并企图把这个条约同美国在太平洋地区策动的和已建立的其他侵略条约联结起来，构成美国在东方的侵略体系。美蒋条约是美国侵略集团对中国人民严重的战争挑衅，是对远东和亚洲和平的重大威胁。为了掩盖美蒋条约的侵略实质，美国故意制造紧张空气，对我国公正判处十三名美国间谍案大肆叫嚣，并操纵联合国通过荒谬决议，对我国进行所谓谴责。美国还在积极策动组织中东侵略体系，企图经过这个体系把美国在西方和东方的侵略体系联结起来，构成一道分裂世界的、对苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的大包围圈，以便于它准备新的世界战争。
    周副主席指出：同美国侵略集团相反，无论在东方和西方，爱好和平的国家作了一切努力来谋求和缓国际紧张局势，保卫世界和平。九年以来，为了建立一个统一、和平、民主的德国，为了反对美国分裂欧洲、建立军事集团的战争政策，为了建立欧洲的集体安全体系，苏联和人民民主国家进行了始终不懈的斗争。最近在莫斯科召开的欧洲国家会议进一步显示了爱好和平国家反对侵略、保卫和平和自身安全的坚强决心和重大努力。中华人民共和国坚决反对巴黎协定，完全支持莫斯科欧洲国家会议通过的关于欧洲集体安全的八国宣言。中苏两国十月十二日的联合宣言表明中苏两国共同一致为巩固和平而密切合作的坚定决心。中印两国和中缅两国所倡导的和平共处的五项原则赢得了世界爱好和平人民的普遍支持。中印两国总理和中缅两国总理的互相访问，加强了中印和中缅的友好合作关系。最近中缅两国发表的联合公报进一步证实和平共处的原则是有强大的生命力的。毫无疑问，亚洲爱好和平的国家间的这些行动对于建立和扩大和平区域、促进集体和平是有着重大的贡献的。
    周副主席严正宣告：“台湾是中国的领土，中国人民不解放台湾决不罢休。中国人民坚决反对美蒋条约，任何战争威胁，决不能吓倒中国人民为保卫自己的国家主权和领土而进行的坚决斗争。任何所谓台湾‘独立国’、台湾‘中立化’和‘托管’台湾的荒谬主张，实际上都是割裂中国领土，都是侵犯中国主权和干涉中国内政，都是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。中国人民坚决要求美国从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量，停止侵犯中国的国家主权和领土完整。中国人民坚决反对美国组织东南亚侵略集团、破坏印度支那和平；积极主张推行和平共处的五项原则，扩大和平地区。中国人民继续主张重新召开有亚洲中立国参加的有关国家的会议来谋求朝鲜的和平统一，坚决反对美国破坏朝鲜停战协定、恶化朝鲜局势的罪恶阴谋。中国人民积极主张同一切国家建立和平合作的关系，只要这些国家具有同样的愿望和诚意。”
    周恩来副主席接着谈到在过去几个月中，我国同阿尔巴尼亚已经互换大使并发展了友好关系；我国同芬兰和挪威、荷兰等国的外交关系有了发展。我国同阿富汗、尼泊尔等国关于建立外交关系的谈判已经有了进展。周恩来副主席并指出：我国也正在同南斯拉夫进行关于外交关系的谈判。
    周副主席在报告中着重地说：“在日内瓦会议期间，由于中英双方的努力，已经使两国的关系有所改进，这是有利于世界和平的。但是，最近以来，英国政府在一些重大问题上，竭力追随美国侵略集团的危险政策，特别是在美国侵略中国领土台湾的问题上，英国政府竟支持美国政府同蒋介石卖国集团签订的所谓‘共同防御条约’，鼓励美国强占台湾。这违背了英国政府在许多庄严的国际条约中所承担的义务，并且使中英关系受到了损伤。中国政府对英国政府所采取的这种态度不能不表示很大的遗憾。”
    周副主席对苏联外交部长莫洛托夫就对日本的关系问题发表的声明表示了热烈的支持，他认为这个声明是有利于促进远东和平事业和缓和国际紧张局势的。周副主席说：“中华人民共和国政府是代表六万万人的中国的唯一合法的政府。中国政府一贯主张在遵守平等、互利和互相尊重领土主权等项原则的基础上同一切国家建立正常关系。我国是愿意同日本建立正常关系的。如果日本政府也能抱有同样的愿望，并采取相应的措施，中国政府将准备采取步骤，来使中国同日本的关系正常化。中国政府主张同日本按照平等互利的原则，广泛发展贸易关系，并同日本建立密切的文化联系。在这方面由于中日两国人民的不断努力，已经有了某些成就，今后会有更大的发展。”
      周副主席强调说：“中国人民一向为促进国际合作、和缓国际紧张局势和保卫远东和世界和平而努力。但是我们决不能容忍侵略。只有反抗侵略，才能保卫和平。保卫和平的斗争是世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的共同斗争。我们反抗侵略、保卫和平的事业是正义的。正义的事业是无敌的。胜利一定属于为正义事业而斗争的人民！”
    周副主席接着说：为着进行这一伟大斗争，全国人民今后需要更广泛地动员起来和更巩固地团结起来。中国人民政治协商会议作为人民民主统一战线的组织，在这一斗争中将继续发挥它在抗美援朝时期中曾经起过的重大作用。
    周副主席说：“中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议代行了全国人民代表大会职权，但其本身并不是全国人民代表大会。现在全国人民代表大会第一次会议已经召开，中国人民政治协商会议代行全国人民代表大会职权的政权机关的作用已经消失，但中国人民政治协商会议本身的统一战线的作用仍然存在。几年来，我国人民民主统一战线是更加扩大了，更加发展了，这次会议就是在这种扩大和发展的基础上召开的。中国人民政治协商会议今后需要在中国共产党领导下，继续作为团结全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和其他爱国民主人士的人民民主统一战线的组织，发挥它应有的作用。”
    周副主席指出：根据“中国人民政治协商会议章程（草案）”总纲的规定，今后中国人民政治协商会议的任务，照毛泽东主席的意见，可归纳为下列五点：第一、协商国际问题。第二、对全国人民代表大会代表和地方同级人民代表大会代表的候选人名单以及中国人民政治协商会议各级组织组成人员的人选进行协商。第三、协助国家机关，推动社会力量，解决社会生活中各阶级间相互关系问题；并联系人民群众，向国家有关机关反映群众的意见和提出建议。第四、协商和处理政协内部和党派团体之间的合作问题。第五、在自愿的基础上，学习马克思列宁主义和努力进行思想改造。
    周副主席最后说：“根据上述五大任务，中国人民政治协商会议在完成国家过渡时期总任务和反对内外敌人的斗争中，具体地说，就是在完成社会主义改造的任务和解放台湾、保卫和平的斗争中，将要继续发挥它的作用，负起它的光荣使命。”
