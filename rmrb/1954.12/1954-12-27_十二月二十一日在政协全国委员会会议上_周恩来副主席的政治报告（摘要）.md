Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) delivered a political report at the first session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC on December 21st.

In his report, Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai said: "In the past six months, due to the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina, and due to the rejection of the 'European Defense Community' treaty by the French National Assembly, the international situation has shown a certain degree of relaxation in both the East and the West.

However, the American aggressor bloc and its followers are not reconciled to the failure of their war policy. They continue to intensify international tensions in the East and the West, striving to expand and deepen the division and split of the world, enslave the local people, and prepare for a new world war."

Vice Chairman Zhou pointed out: The American aggressor bloc and its British and French followers concluded the Paris Agreement in Europe, attempting to deepen the division of Germany and Europe, revive German militarism, and expand the European aggressive system. In the East, the American aggressor bloc and its followers concluded the Manila Treaty, which aims to undermine the Geneva Accords. The United States is actively invading Vietnam, violating the Geneva Accords in all aspects, and trying to turn South Vietnam into its military base. The United States is stepping up the arming of Syngman Rhee's troops in Korea, manipulating the United Nations to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Recently, the United States openly signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, infringing on our country's sovereignty, legalizing the occupation of our territory Taiwan, and turning Taiwan into a military base for the United States to expand its aggression. The United States is also attempting to link this treaty with other aggressive treaties that the United States has instigated and established in the Pacific region, forming an aggressive system for the United States in the East. The US-Chiang treaty is a serious war provocation by the American aggressor bloc against the Chinese people and a major threat to peace in the Far East and Asia. In order to cover up the aggressive nature of the US-Chiang treaty, the United States deliberately created a tense atmosphere, clamored loudly about our country's just sentencing of thirteen American spies, and manipulated the United Nations to pass absurd resolutions to carry out so-called condemnation against our country. The United States is also actively instigating the organization of a Middle East aggressive system, attempting to link the American aggressive systems in the West and the East through this system, forming a large encirclement of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries, in order to facilitate its preparation for a new world war.

Vice Chairman Zhou pointed out: Contrary to the American aggressor bloc, both in the East and the West, peace-loving countries have made every effort to seek relaxation of international tensions and safeguard world peace. For nine years, in order to establish a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, in order to oppose the American policy of splitting Europe and establishing military blocs, and in order to establish a European collective security system, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have carried out unremitting struggles. The recent conference of European countries in Moscow further demonstrated the firm determination and great efforts of peace-loving countries to oppose aggression, safeguard peace, and protect their own security. The People's Republic of China resolutely opposes the Paris Agreement and fully supports the eight-nation declaration on European collective security adopted by the Moscow European countries conference. The joint declaration of China and the Soviet Union on October 12 demonstrates the firm determination of China and the Soviet Union to closely cooperate for the consolidation of peace. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China and India, and China and Burma have won the universal support of peace-loving people around the world. The mutual visits of the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma have strengthened the friendly and cooperative relations between China and India, and China and Burma. The joint communiqu√© recently issued by China and Burma further confirms that the principle of peaceful coexistence has strong vitality. There is no doubt that these actions among peace-loving countries in Asia have made significant contributions to establishing and expanding peace zones and promoting collective peace.

Vice Chairman Zhou solemnly declared: "Taiwan is China's territory, and the Chinese people will never give up until Taiwan is liberated. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the US-Chiang treaty, and no war threat can intimidate the Chinese people in their resolute struggle to defend their national sovereignty and territory. Any absurd proposals for a so-called Taiwan 'independent country,' Taiwan 'neutralization,' and 'trusteeship' of Taiwan are in fact splitting Chinese territory, infringing on Chinese sovereignty, and interfering in Chinese internal affairs, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate. The Chinese people resolutely demand that the United States withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, and stop infringing on China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the United States organizing the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and undermining peace in Indochina; and actively advocate implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and expanding the peace zone. The Chinese people continue to advocate reconvening a conference of relevant countries with the participation of Asian neutral countries to seek the peaceful reunification of Korea, and resolutely oppose the sinister conspiracy of the United States to undermine the Korean armistice agreement and worsen the Korean situation. The Chinese people actively advocate establishing peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries, as long as these countries have the same desire and sincerity."

Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai went on to say that in the past few months, our country has exchanged ambassadors with Albania and developed friendly relations; our country's diplomatic relations with Finland, Norway, the Netherlands and other countries have developed. Negotiations between our country and Afghanistan, Nepal and other countries on the establishment of diplomatic relations have made progress. Vice Chairman Zhou Enlai also pointed out that our country is also conducting negotiations with Yugoslavia on diplomatic relations.

Vice Chairman Zhou emphasized in his report: "During the Geneva Conference, thanks to the efforts of both China and Britain, the relations between the two countries have improved to some extent, which is conducive to world peace. However, recently, the British government has been trying its best to follow the dangerous policies of the American aggressor bloc on some major issues, especially on the issue of American aggression against China's territory Taiwan, the British government has actually supported the so-called 'Mutual Defense Treaty' signed by the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and encouraged the United States to occupy Taiwan. This violates the obligations undertaken by the British government in many solemn international treaties, and has damaged Sino-British relations. The Chinese government cannot but express great regret over this attitude adopted by the British government."

Vice Chairman Zhou expressed his warm support for the statement made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the issue of relations with Japan, and he believed that this statement was conducive to promoting the cause of peace in the Far East and easing international tensions. Vice Chairman Zhou said: "The government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the 600 million Chinese people. The Chinese government has consistently maintained that normal relations should be established with all countries on the basis of observing the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. Our country is willing to establish normal relations with Japan. If the Japanese government can also have the same desire and take corresponding measures, the Chinese government will be prepared to take steps to normalize the relations between China and Japan. The Chinese government advocates extensively developing trade relations with Japan in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and establishing close cultural ties with Japan. In this regard, thanks to the continuous efforts of the people of China and Japan, there have been some achievements, and there will be greater development in the future."

Vice Chairman Zhou emphasized: "The Chinese people have always strived to promote international cooperation, ease international tensions, and safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. But we can never tolerate aggression. Only by resisting aggression can we defend peace. The struggle to defend peace is the common struggle of all peace-loving countries and people in the world. Our cause of resisting aggression and defending peace is just. The just cause is invincible. Victory must belong to the people who fight for the just cause!"

Vice Chairman Zhou then said: In order to carry out this great struggle, the people of the whole country need to be more widely mobilized and more firmly united in the future. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as an organization of the people's democratic united front, will continue to play the significant role it played during the period of Resisting America and Aiding Korea in this struggle.

Vice Chairman Zhou said: "The First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercised the functions and powers of the National People's Congress on its behalf, but it itself is not the National People's Congress. Now that the First Session of the National People's Congress has been convened, the role of the political power organ of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercising the functions and powers of the National People's Congress on its behalf has disappeared, but the role of the united front of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference itself still exists. In the past few years, our country's people's democratic united front has been further expanded and developed, and this meeting was convened on the basis of this expansion and development. In the future, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference needs to continue to serve the organization of the people's democratic united front that unites all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic people in the country, and play its due role."

Vice Chairman Zhou pointed out: According to the provisions of the General Program of the "Draft Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference," the tasks of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in the future, according to Chairman Mao Zedong's opinion, can be summarized as the following five points: First, to discuss international issues. Second, to negotiate on the list of candidates for representatives to the National People's Congress and representatives to the local people's congresses at the same level, as well as the candidates for the composition of the organizations at all levels of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Third, to assist state organs, promote social forces, resolve issues of mutual relations between classes in social life; and to contact the people and reflect their opinions and suggestions to the relevant state organs. Fourth, to negotiate and handle cooperation issues within the CPPCC and between parties and groups. Fifth, to study Marxism-Leninism and strive for ideological remolding on a voluntary basis.

Vice Chairman Zhou finally said: "According to the above-mentioned five major tasks, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will continue to play its role and fulfill its glorious mission in completing the general task of the state's transition period and in the struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, specifically, in completing the task of socialist transformation and liberating Taiwan and defending peace."
