Heilongjiang State-Run Chahayang and eighteen other mechanical farms have reclaimed 160,340 mu of wasteland this year. Currently, these newly reclaimed lands are covered with a layer of white snow, and after the spring thaw, they will all be sown with soybeans and wheat. Before and after the harvest season this year, all farms mobilized more than fifty tractors, working in two shifts day and night; labor competitions were also launched between vehicles and between farms to accelerate the pace of land reclamation. During the operations, many machines exceeded their quotas and created land reclamation records. At Sandaogang Farm, three "Stalin-80" tractors reclaimed 100 mu per shift, exceeding the quota by 32 percent. The "Stalin-80" machine at Chahayang created a record of reclaiming 124 mu per day. Due to the full efficiency of the machines, the Suibin Farm completed its task of reclaiming 18,000 mu of wasteland a month ahead of schedule, by the end of August. Because of the emphasis on quality inspection during the operations, the quality of land reclamation this year has been generally good, with a depth of generally 20 centimeters. Night operations also met the prescribed requirements. (Gong Wanzhong)

    黑龙江国营机械农场今年开荒十六万亩
    黑龙江省国营查哈阳等十八个机械农场，今年开垦荒地十六万零三百四十亩。目前这些新开垦起来的土地上已盖上了一层白雪，明春解冻后将全部播种大豆和小麦。今年挂锄前后，各场共出动了五十多台拖拉机，分日夜两班进行作业；车与车，场与场之间并开展劳动竞赛，加快了开荒进度。在作业中很多机车突破了定额，创造了开荒纪录，三道岗农场有三台“斯大林八十号”拖拉机每班开荒达一百亩，超过定额百分之三十二。查哈阳的“斯大林八十号”机车创造日开一百二十四亩的纪录；绥滨农场由于机车充分发挥了效能，于八月底就提前一个月完成了开荒一万八千亩的任务。在作业中又由于强调质量检查，今年开荒质量普遍良好，深度一般都在二十公分。夜间作业也都达到了规定的要求。　（宫万钟）
