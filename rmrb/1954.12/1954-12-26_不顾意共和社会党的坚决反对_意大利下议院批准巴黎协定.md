Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Italian Chamber of Deputies debated the issue of ratifying the Paris Agreement from the 13th to the 23rd. On the evening of the 23rd, the Chamber of Deputies approved the Paris Agreement by a vote of 335 to 215. Voting in favor of ratification were the parties participating in the Scelba government, as well as the monarchist and neo-fascist party members. Voting against ratification were the Communist and Socialist party members, as well as two Christian Democratic party members.

During the debate, Communist and Socialist party members spoke out resolutely against the ratification of the Paris Agreement, emphasizing the agreement's nature as a preparation for aggressive war and the fatal consequences it would bring to Italy.

Chamber of Deputies member and General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, Vittorio, spoke out against the ratification of the Paris Agreement, saying that arming West Germany would hinder German reunification and make it impossible to reach an agreement between European countries. Arming West Germany means rebuilding an army that once killed many workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and destroyed countless valuable properties.

The Communist Party members put forward a proposal suggesting refusing the ratification of the Paris Agreement. In addition, some Communist and Socialist party members put forward a proposal: In view of the fact that the Western governments have undertaken new and serious obligations regarding the use of atomic weapons at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, which makes the Paris Agreement even more dangerous, it is recommended that the parliament postpone the discussion of the Paris Agreement. However, these proposals were rejected by the majority of the Chamber of Deputies.

In the debate, it is noteworthy that even within Scelba's Christian Democratic Party, some members publicly expressed strong unease about the consequences of the Paris Agreement. Christian Democratic party member Batzaghi expressed doubt about the claim that arming Germany would ease world tensions and strengthen peace. Another Christian Democratic party member, Meloni, put forward a proposal stipulating that if the Paris Agreement is approved, its implementation will be postponed for three months. This proposal was also rejected by a majority vote. However, during the vote, twenty-nine Christian Democratic party members, including the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gronchi, "betrayed" the decision of the Scelba Christian Democratic Party leadership and voted in favor of the proposal. In the final vote to approve the Paris Agreement, Meloni and Batzaghi, despite the threats from the Christian Democratic Party leadership, still voted against the ratification of the Paris Agreement.

    不顾意共和社会党的坚决反对
    意大利下议院批准巴黎协定
    据新华社讯：意大利下议院十三日到二十三日就批准巴黎协定问题进行辩论。二十三日晚，下议院以三百三十五票对二百一十五票批准巴黎协定。投票赞成批准的是参加谢尔巴政府的各党派、以及保皇党和新法西斯党议员，投票反对批准的是共产党和社会党议员，还有二个天主教民主党议员。
      在辩论过程中，共产党和社会党议员发言坚决反对批准巴黎协定，他们着重指出了巴黎协定准备侵略战争的性质及它将给意大利带来的致命后果。
    下议院议员、意大利总工会总书记维多里奥发言反对批准巴黎协定，他说，武装西德就要阻碍德国的统一，使在欧洲国家之间达成协议成为不可能。武装西德，就是重建一支曾经杀死了许多工人、农民和知识分子，曾经破坏了无数宝贵财产的军队。
      共产党议员提出了提案，建议拒绝批准巴黎协定。另外，一些共产党和社会党议员提出了一个提案：鉴于西方国家政府在北大西洋集团理事会会议上在使用原子武器方面承担了新的严重义务，这使巴黎协定更加危险，因此建议议会延期讨论巴黎协定。但是，这些提案都被下议院的多数否决。
    在辩论中，值得注意的是，甚至在谢尔巴天主教民主党内部也有一些议员公开对巴黎协定的后果表示强烈的不安。天主教民主党议员巴特萨吉对所谓武装德国会缓和世界紧张局势和加强和平的说法表示怀疑。另一个天主教民主党议员麦洛尼提出一项提案，规定在巴黎协定获得批准的情况下延期三个月实施。这个提案也被多数票所否决，然而在表决中，有包括下议院议长格隆基在内的二十九个天主教民主党议员“背叛”了谢尔巴天主教民主党领导机关的决定，投票赞成这个提案。在最后表决批准巴黎协定时，麦洛尼和巴特萨吉仍不顾天主教民主党领导机构的威胁，而投票反对批准巴黎协定。
