Xinhua News Agency, December 12th -- According to TASS: The International Rural Youth Conference opened in Vienna on the 9th. Representatives from more than sixty countries, including the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, France, Britain, Italy, India, and Japan, are participating in the conference. This is the first such large-scale international meeting of rural youth from various countries in history. The central issue for discussion at the conference is: to strengthen the unity of rural youth from various countries, and to strive for world peace and for the improvement of the living and working conditions of rural youth.

The Italian representative, Konkas, delivered a report at the conference. He pointed out that currently, in the rural areas of capitalist and colonial countries, millions of young men and women are living miserable lives. Many rural youth have no land, no work, and receive no education. Konkas said that one of the main reasons for the deterioration of the living and working conditions of rural youth in these countries is that the ruling groups of some Western countries are carrying out arms expansion and war preparations, attempting to deepen international tensions, prevent the establishment of a collective security system, obstruct the development of friendly international relations, and deprive people of the right to decide their own fate. Konkas emphasized that rural youth from various countries must strengthen their unity and carry out struggles to defend peace and security, win national independence, and improve the lives of rural youth. Konkas suggested that this conference discuss a draft charter including the basic demands of rural youth. He also suggested that after this conference, a number of national and local meetings be organized to discuss various issues related to rural youth, that cooperation committees be organized between rural and urban youth, that friendship committees be organized between youth from various countries, and that experiences be regularly exchanged domestically and internationally.

The conference began discussing Konkas's report on the 10th. Representatives from many capitalist and colonial countries used concrete examples to illustrate the hardships of rural life in their countries. The Iranian representative, Nadar, said that feudal landlords and foreign colonialists rule the rural areas of Iran, and 60 percent of farmers have no land. The farmers bear the heavy burden of exorbitant taxes. The Honduran representative, Geviz, said that almost all of Honduras' arable land is controlled by the American United Fruit Company, and Honduran farmers are deprived of various political and social rights.

Many representatives expressed the desire of their countries' rural youth to maintain international peace and security in their speeches. The Bulgarian representative, Kovacheva, called on young farmers and rural workers from European countries to intensify their struggle against the remilitarization of West Germany and to strive for the establishment of a European collective security system.

    国际农村青年大会在维也纳开幕
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社消息：国际农村青年大会九日在维也纳开幕。参加大会的有苏联、中华人民共和国、法国、英国、意大利、印度和日本等六十多个国家的代表。这是各国农村青年在历史上第一次举行这样盛大的国际会议。大会讨论的中心问题是：加强各国农村青年的团结，为争取世界和平、为改善农村青年的生活条件和工作条件而斗争。
    意大利代表康卡斯在大会上作了报告。他指出，目前在资本主义国家和殖民地国家的农村中，千百万男女青年正在过着悲惨的生活。许多农村青年没有土地，没有工作，受不到教育。康卡斯说，这些国家农村青年生活条件和工作条件的恶化，主要的原因之一是一些西方国家的统治集团实行扩军备战，力图加深国际紧张局势、阻止建立集体安全体系，阻挠国际友好关系的开展，剥夺人民解决自己的命运的权利。康卡斯强调说，各国农村青年要加强团结，进行斗争，来保卫和平和安全，赢得民族独立和改善农村青年的生活。康卡斯建议这次大会讨论一项包括农村青年基本要求的宪章草案。他并建议在这次大会以后，组织一些全国性的和地方性的会议来讨论和农村青年有关的各种问题，组织农村青年和城市青年的合作委员会，组织各国青年友好委员会，并且在国内和国际范围内定期交流经验。
    大会在十日开始讨论康卡斯的报告。许多资本主义国家和殖民地国家的代表都用具体的事例说明了他们国家农村生活的苦况。伊朗代表纳达尔说，封建地主和外国殖民主义者统治着伊朗的农村，百分之六十的农民是没有土地的。农民们肩负着苛捐杂税的重担。洪都拉斯代表格维兹说，洪都拉斯差不多全部可耕地都被美国的联合果品公司控制，洪都拉斯的农民被剥夺了各种政治权利和社会权利。
    许多代表在发言中表达了他们国家的农村青年维护国际和平和安全的愿望。保加利亚代表科瓦契娃在发言中号召欧洲各国青年农民和农村工作者加紧进行斗争，反对西德重新军国主义化，争取建立欧洲集体安全体系。
