Eleven agricultural machine tractor stations planned for construction in Hebei Province this autumn have been established successively in Ge Village, Shahe County, Boyan Township, Wu'an County, and Yaozhuang Township, Mancheng County from mid-October to mid-November. Including the three tractor stations established last winter and this spring, the province has now built a total of fourteen agricultural machine tractor stations.

After the establishment of these tractor stations, they signed contracts with local agricultural producers' cooperatives to cultivate 80,000 mu of land on their behalf, based on the station's machinery and equipment conditions. According to statistics from thirteen tractor stations, as of November 22nd, they had cultivated more than 21,800 mu of land for agricultural producers' cooperatives according to the contracts.

The establishment of these tractor stations has greatly promoted the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement. Upon hearing the news of the station's construction, 584 farmers in Dongshijing Township, Hejian County, applied to join cooperatives within five days. In Ge Village, Dongcui, and Xicui, three villages in Shahe County, all poor and middle peasants joined cooperatives during the construction of the station, except for five rich peasant households.

The establishment of these tractor stations has also further enhanced the peasants' enthusiasm for production. Members of four cooperatives in Boyan Township, Wu'an County, actively managed their cotton fields in order to promote early cotton maturity and used tractors for autumn plowing to free up land. The Xinxin Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Xinxing Township, Lixian County, applied base fertilizer to all 2,700 mu of mechanically cultivated land, as stipulated in the agreement, applying an average of 2,000 jin of coarse manure per mu.

    河北又建立十一个拖拉机站
    河北省今秋筹建的十一个农业机器拖拉机站，已于十月中旬到十一月中旬先后在沙河县葛村、武安县伯延乡、满城县要庄乡等地成立。加上去冬今春建立的三个拖拉机站，全省共已建成十四个农业机器拖拉机站。
    这些拖拉机站建立后，根据站内机具设备情况，分别和当地农业生产合作社签订了代耕八万亩地的合同。据十三个拖拉机站的统计，到十一月二十二日已按合同给农业生产合作社耕地两万一千八百多亩。
    这些拖拉机站的建立，大大促进了农业合作化运动的发展。河间县东诗经乡农民听到建站消息，五天内就有五百八十四人报名入社。沙河县葛村、东崔、西崔三个村建站过程中，除了五户富农外，贫农中农都入社了。
    这些拖拉机站的建立，也进一步提高了农民的生产热情。武安县伯延乡四个社的社员为促进棉花早熟腾地用拖拉机秋耕，积极地进行棉田管理。蠡县辛兴乡新新农业生产合作社，按照协议书上的规定，在两千七百亩的机耕地里普遍上了基肥，平均每亩地施粗肥两千斤。
