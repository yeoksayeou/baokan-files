Xinhua News Agency, Guangyuan, December 13th: The southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been laid to Guangyuan County in northern Sichuan Province on the 12th. This track laying project was completed three days ahead of the original plan. The Chengdu-Guangyuan section will officially open to traffic on New Year's Day next year.

On the afternoon of the 12th, as the rails were laid to Guangyuan Station, an engineering train fully loaded with steel rails immediately ran over the newly laid tracks. The track-laying workers continued to push northward, striving to lay more than ten kilometers before the end of the year.

This year, the track-laying project on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway began at Zhongba in Jiangyou County, Sichuan Province. The entire section from Zhongba to Guangyuan is hilly and mountainous, spanning more than 150 kilometers. The railway construction workers overcame many difficulties, passed through the Jianmen Mountains, which are over 60 kilometers long, and learned many complex techniques such as building bridges on curves and laying tracks on steep slopes.

    宝成铁路南段铺轨到广元
    【新华社广元十三日电】宝成铁路南段已在十二日铺轨到四川省北部的广元县。这段铺轨工程比原订计划提前三天完工。成都广元间将在明年元旦正式通车。
    十二日那天下午，当路轨铺到广元车站时，满载钢轨的工程列车立即从新铺的轨道上行驶过来。铺轨工人们又继续向北推进，他们要争取在年内再多铺十几公里。
    今年宝成铁路南段铺轨工程是从四川省江油县的中坝开始的。从中坝到广元全部是丘陵地带和大山区，有一百五十多公里。筑路工人战胜了很多困难，穿过长达六十多公里的剑门山区，学会了弯道架桥和高坡铺轨等许多复杂的技术。
