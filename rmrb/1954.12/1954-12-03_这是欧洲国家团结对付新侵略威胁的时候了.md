    This is the time for European countries to unite against new threats of aggression
  　Our reporter Li He
    The European countries' conference on guaranteeing European peace and security has been working in Moscow for three days. On the first day, the head of the Soviet delegation, Molotov, and the head of the Polish delegation, Cyrankiewicz, spoke. On the second day, the head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Široký, and the head of the German Democratic Republic delegation, Grotewohl, spoke. On the third day, Zhang Wentian, as an observer representing the People's Republic of China, spoke; also speaking were the heads of the delegations from Albania, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria.
    The meetings are held every afternoon in the hall of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Guest House on Tolstoy Street. Press conferences are held every day after the meetings at the Journalists' Club on Suvorov Boulevard. Every day at six or seven o'clock in the afternoon, many reporters gather at the club, from where they obtain official news for release.
    At the European countries' conference on guaranteeing European peace and security, participants successively pointed out that it is not too late to negotiate on the basis of the two principles put forward by the head of the Soviet delegation, Molotov, on November 29, which are:
    1.  Absolutely no revival of German militarism, which launched the First and Second World Wars, and finally, on the basis of reaching an agreement, first on the basis of reaching an agreement among the four countries that bear special responsibility for solving the German problem, and therefore also bear special responsibility for guaranteeing European peace and security, steadfastly and patiently seek a solution to the German problem.
    2.  Establish a European collective security system with the participation of all European countries (regardless of their national and social systems) that are concerned with maintaining and consolidating peace, and for this purpose, carefully study the Soviet draft "All-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security" and suggestions on this issue that other countries may put forward.
    This attitude stems from the participating countries' love of peace and their high sense of responsibility for ensuring the safety of the European people. These peace-loving countries are by no means intimidated by the so-called "strength" policy of the United States and its followers, Britain and France. If the United States and its followers continue to refuse to consider the proposal to establish European collective security and stubbornly pursue their policies of reviving German militarism and creating new wars, then the peace-loving countries of Europe, learning from the historical lessons of the Second World War, must, in the current situation, heighten their vigilance and strengthen their own defense forces in order to safeguard their own security and the interests of their people. This common view was put forward in the speeches of the participants. They all agreed with the opinion of the head of the Soviet delegation, Molotov:
  “It is necessary to be fully prepared to take some measures adapted to the current situation to strengthen defense forces. This requires the countries participating in this conference to take common measures in organizing armed forces and establishing command headquarters, and to take other measures to reliably protect the peaceful labor of the people of our countries, ensure the inviolability of their borders, and prevent possible aggression.”
    The participants paid great attention to the German issue, hoping that it could be resolved correctly, because it is the key to European peace and security. The head of the Polish delegation, Cyrankiewicz, said in his speech: "As long as the agreement on remilitarizing West Germany has not been ratified, all avenues for countries to negotiate a peaceful resolution of the German issue, with German participation, are open, and it can enable Germany to achieve unity on a democratic and peaceful basis. Ratification of the agreement to rearm West Germany will block these avenues." The responsibility will naturally be borne by the United States, Britain and France.
    The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Široký, in his speech, supported the establishment of an effective European collective security system, as this would guarantee the peace and security of Europe, including Czechoslovakia. He said: If Western countries continue to pursue the policy of ratifying the Paris Accords, then,
  “The Government of the Czechoslovak Republic believes that, in this case, it is necessary for the countries participating in the conference to jointly take some measures to strengthen and coordinate their armed forces and place these forces under a unified command.”
    The head of the German Democratic Republic delegation, Grotewohl, explained the great anxiety felt by the German people because the West German Bonn regime had signed the Paris Accords, and then said that ratification of the Paris Accords would be an obstacle to the restoration of German unity. Therefore, the struggle of the German Democratic Republic against the revival of West German militarism and to defend peace is also a struggle to restore German unity under peaceful conditions. If West Germany restores militarism and establishes a regular army, the German Democratic Republic will be forced to establish national armed forces capable of defending the peaceful achievements of the working people of the German Democratic Republic in response to this situation. The German Democratic Republic fully supports the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia on the need to take joint measures against the resurgence of German imperialism.
    In his speech, Zhang Wentian, the representative of the People's Republic of China, on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China, expressed full agreement with and support for the Soviet government's proposal to establish a European collective security system. In his speech, he said:
  “If the Paris Accords are ratified, then it is very necessary and reasonable for peace-loving countries, especially the Eastern European countries directly threatened by West German militarism, to take new measures to safeguard peace and their own security. As Comrade Molotov, the head of the Soviet delegation, pointed out, in the new situation, the measures previously taken in this regard are far from sufficient. This requires the countries of the peace and democracy camp to further strengthen themselves, strengthen national defense and armed forces, strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation among the countries of the peace and democracy camp, and take common measures in organizing defense. The entire peace and democracy camp must be as strong and consolidated as a copper wall and iron wall, so that the conspiracies and tricks of those aggressors will never succeed.” The speech of the representative of the People's Republic of China stated that the Chinese people oppose the American aggression bloc arming Japan in Asia and also oppose it arming West Germany in Europe; the Chinese people are fighting for peace in Asia and their own security, and also support the struggle to guarantee peace in Europe.
    The three days of the conference gave the profound impression that in the struggle to prevent the revival of West German militarism and the resurgence of aggressive forces, and to guarantee European peace and security, the peace-loving countries demonstrated strong unity and solidarity. The conference will surely successfully complete its historical mission and further strengthen world peace and international security.

### 这是欧洲国家团结对付新侵略威胁的时候了

    这是欧洲国家团结对付新侵略威胁的时候了
  　本报记者  李何
    保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家会议，在莫斯科已经进行三天工作。第一天，苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫和波兰代表团团长西伦凯维兹发言。第二天，捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长西罗基和德意志民主共和国代表团团长格罗提渥发言。第三天，中华人民共和国代表张闻天以观察员身份发言；发言的还有阿、罗、匈、保四国代表团团长。
    会议每天下午在托尔斯泰大街苏联外交部迎宾馆的大厅举行。每天会后在苏沃洛夫林荫路报刊工作者俱乐部举行记者招待会。每天下午六七点钟，在俱乐部集中了许多记者，他们都是从这里取得正式新闻发布出去。
    在保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家会议上，与会者先后指出，如果现在能以苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫在十一月二十九日所提出的两项原则为基础进行协商还不为晚，这两项原则就是：
    一、绝不允许发动过第一次和第二次世界大战的德国军国主义复活，最后在取得协议的基础上，首先是在对解决德国问题负有特别重大的责任、因而也对保障欧洲的和平和安全负有特别重大责任的四国取得协议的基础上，坚定和耐心地谋求德国问题的解决。
    二、建立有一切关心维护和巩固和平的欧洲国家（不论它们的国家制度和社会制度如何）参加的欧洲集体安全体系，并且为了这个目的而非常仔细地研究苏联的“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”草案及其他国家可能提出来的关于这个问题的建议。
    这种态度，是出于与会国家对于和平的爱护和对于保障欧洲人民的安全的高度责任感。这些爱好和平国家决不是美国及其追随者英国和法国的所谓“实力”政策所能恫吓的。如果美国及其追随者仍然拒绝考虑建立欧洲集体安全的建议，仍然固执地推行它们的复活德国军国主义和制造新战争的政策，那么，欧洲爱好和平的国家吸取第二次世界大战的历史教训，为了保障自己的安全和人民的利益，在目前形势下必须提高警惕，加强本身的防卫力量。在与会者的发言中，都提出了这种共同的主张。他们都赞同苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫的意见：
  “必须充分地准备采取一些适应于目前局势的措施去加强防御力量。这就要求参加这次会议的国家在组织武装部队及建立司令部方面采取共同措施，并且采取其他措施，以便可靠地保护我们这些国家的人民的和平劳动，保障他们的国境不受侵犯，并且防止可能的侵略。”
    与会者非常注意德国问题，希望它能够获得正确的解决，因为这是欧洲和平和安全的关键。波兰代表团团长西伦凯维兹在发言中说：“只要关于使西德重新军国主义化的协定没有被批准，在有德国参加的情况下由各国协商和平解决德国问题的一切道路都是开放着的，并且能够使德国在民主和和平的基础上实现统一。批准重新武装西德的协定，就将堵塞这些道路。”而责任自然要由美国和英国法国来担负。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长西罗基在发言中赞成建立有效的欧洲集体安全体系，因为这将保障包括捷克斯洛伐克在内的欧洲的和平和安全。他说：如果西方国家继续进行批准巴黎协定的方针，那么，
  “捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府认为，在这种情况下，参加会议的国家就有必要共同采取一些措施，来加强和调配它们的武装部队，并把这些部队置于单一的司令部之下。”
    德意志民主共和国代表团团长格罗提渥说明了德国人民因为西德波恩政权签署巴黎协定而感到极大的焦虑之后说道，巴黎协定的批准将是恢复德国统一的障碍，因此德意志民主共和国进行的反对复活西德军国主义和保卫和平的斗争，同时是在和平的条件下恢复德国的统一的斗争，如果西德恢复了军国主义和建立起正规军队，德意志民主共和国将会被迫针对这一情况建立起能够保卫德意志民主共和国劳动人民的和平成就的国家武装力量。德意志民主共和国完全支持苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克关于必须采取反对德国帝国主义再起的共同措施。
    中华人民共和国代表张闻天在发言中代表中华人民共和国政府，表示完全同意和支持苏联政府关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。他在发言中说：
  “如果巴黎协定得到批准，那么爱好和平的国家，特别是受西德军国主义直接威胁的东欧各国，采取新的措施以保障和平和自身的安全，就是非常必要和合理的了。正像苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫同志指出的，在新的形势下，以前在这方面所采取的措施就大大的不够了。这就要求和平民主阵营国家进一步壮大自己，加强国防和武装力量，加强和平民主阵营各国间的互助合作，并在组织防御上采取共同措施。必须使整个和平民主阵营坚强和巩固得像铜墙铁壁一样，让那些侵略者的阴谋诡计永远无法得逞。”中华人民共和国代表的发言表示：中国人民既反对美国侵略集团在亚洲武装日本，也反对它在欧洲武装西德；中国人民既为亚洲的和平和本国的安全而斗争，也拥护为保障欧洲和平的斗争。
    三天的会议给人这样深刻的印象：在防止西德军国主义复活和侵略势力再起以及保障欧洲和平和安全的斗争中，爱好和平的国家表现了坚强的一致和团结。会议一定将顺利地完成它的历史任务，进一步加强世界的和平和国际的安全。
