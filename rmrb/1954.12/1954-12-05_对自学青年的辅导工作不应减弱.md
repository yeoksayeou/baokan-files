To the Editor:

This year, in August and September, the cultural and educational departments of various large and medium-sized cities in Jiangsu Province spent considerable effort guiding the self-study activities of middle and primary school graduates who failed to advance to higher education, in order to properly place them. This was supported by parents and students. However, since September, most city cultural and educational departments have shown a trend of weakening their guidance work for youth self-study. According to statistics from nine cities in our province, the number of young people participating in self-study is less than 50% of the total number of middle and primary school graduates who did not advance. In Wuxi, only 31% are participating in self-study, and in Taizhou, it is only 14.6%. The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education frequently receive requests and inquiries from below, many of which could have been resolved by the city's cultural and educational departments. Due to the lack of leadership, these problems are concentrated at the provincial level.

The reasons given by the cultural and educational departments are: 1. Self-study groups can listen to self-study broadcast lectures; 2. Political and ideological education, as well as organizing cultural, recreational, sports, visits, and tours, can be led by the Communist Youth League, without the need for the cultural and educational departments to manage them. In fact, most of the graduates participating in self-study are young people aged fifteen or sixteen, and their academic performance varies. Relying solely on broadcasting is not sufficient. The average score of the Dongzhong City and other self-study groups in Suzhou for algebra tests is only around 50, and the worst is only over 20. They urgently hope that someone will tutor them and answer their questions. Who says they don't need guidance? Secondly, self-study is a long-term undertaking and an indispensable form of social education in the future. If it does not receive the leadership of the local Party committee and the active participation of the education administrative department, and is completely pushed onto the Communist Youth League, it will not work.

The Suzhou Municipal Education Bureau once handed over the affairs of middle and primary school student self-study to the Communist Youth League. The Municipal Committee of the Youth League has repeatedly applied to the Education Bureau to assign a dedicated person to assist and invited several teachers to tutor the graduates. The person in charge of the United Front Work Department of the Youth League personally went to see Shen Zhenmeng, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, four times, and the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee also asked the Education Bureau to take more responsibility for teaching content and guidance work, but so far, Shen Zhenmeng, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, is still using "research and research" as an excuse to delay. When graduates participating in self-study in the central district of Suzhou went to the First Cultural Center to borrow books, the management staff said: There are no arrangements from above. Our cultural center is open to workers and peasants. Since you are neither workers nor peasants, you cannot borrow books.

In order to care for and cultivate the younger generation, and for the construction of the motherland, we, on behalf of the middle and primary school students who are self-studying, request the cultural and educational departments to assist the Communist Youth League in earnestly organizing and leading the self-study activities of middle and primary school graduates, helping them to progress and become useful talents for the construction of the socialist motherland.

### 对自学青年的辅导工作不应减弱

    对自学青年的辅导工作不应减弱编辑同志：
    今年八、九月间，我们江苏省各个大、中城市的文教部门，为了妥善安插未能升学的中、小学毕业生，曾花了很大的力量，领导毕业生的自学活动，得到了家长和学生们的拥护。但是九月以后，大多数城市的文教部门，对于青年自学辅导工作有日趋削弱现象。据我省九个市的统计，参加自学的青年还不及未升学的中、小学毕业生总数的百分之五十，在无锡市，至今才有百分之三十一的人数参加了自学活动，而泰州市只及百分之十四点六。青年团江苏省委会和江苏省教育厅经常接到下面来的请示和询问，其中有许多问题原来都是各城市的文教部门可以解决的。正因为缺乏领导，这些问题都集中到省里来了。
    文教部门的理由是：一、自学小组的课程可以收听自学广播讲座；二、政治思想教育，以及组织文娱、体育、参观、访问等活动，可以由青年团负责带领，用不着文教部门去管。事实上，参加自学的毕业生，多半是十五、六岁的青年，他们的成绩参差不齐，完全依靠广播是不行的。苏州市东中市等自学小组测验代数的总平均分数只有五十来分，最差的只有二十多分，他们迫切地希望有人来替他们补课、解答疑问。谁说用不着辅导呢？其次、自学活动是一种长期性的工作，是今后社会教育中必不可少的形式；如果得不到当地党委的领导，教育行政部门的积极参加，完全推在青年团的身上，也是不行的。
    苏州市教育局曾把中、小学生自学的事宜给青年团接管，团市委屡次申请教育局抽出一个专人来帮助，并邀请几位老师对毕业生进行辅导。团统战部负责人亲自去找教育局副局长沈振猛四次，市委宣传部也要教育局在教学内容和辅导工作方面多负些责任，可是至今教育局副局长沈振猛仍然用“研究研究”为借口，一直拖延不办。苏州市中区参加自学的毕业生到第一文化馆去借阅图书，管理人员便说：上面没有布置，我们文化馆是向工农开门的，你们既不是工人又不是农民，不能借阅。
    为了爱护和培养年轻的一代，为了祖国的建设，我们代表正在自学的中、小学生要求文教部门协助青年团认真地组织和领导中、小学毕业生的自学活动，帮助他们进步，使他们成为建设社会主义祖国的有用人材。
