    Tenth Anniversary of the Signing of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance
    Moscow Holds Commemorative Meeting
   [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th] According to TASS, Moscow: The Soviet Peace Defense Committee, the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Soviet Writers' Union, the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, and the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee jointly held a meeting in the Column Hall of the Trade Union Building in Moscow on the 10th to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance.
    More than two thousand people attended the meeting. French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Louis Joxe and diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union, as well as French writers Louis Aragon and Elsa Triolet, who are currently in Moscow, were also invited to attend the meeting.
    Soviet and French national flags were hung on the rostrum of the meeting. In the center was the slogan written in Russian and French: "Long live the friendly cooperation between the Soviet and French people for the consolidation of peace!" On both sides gleamed the golden letters "1944-1954".
    When the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the government, including Bulganin, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Khrushchev, and Shvernik, took their seats on the rostrum, the attendees greeted them with warm and prolonged applause.
    The meeting was presided over by Shvernik, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. In his opening remarks, he emphasized the significance of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance. He said that today, as we commemorate the tenth anniversary of the signing of the treaty of alliance and mutual assistance, which is in the vital interests of our two peoples, certain countries, primarily the ruling circles of the United States, are counting on reviving aggressive German militarism by creating tension in Europe and deepening the threat of a new world war through the so-called Paris and London agreements. It is very clear that if France and the Soviet Union continue to jointly abide by the Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance and jointly seek ways to ensure their external security in the spirit of this treaty, then no one will dare to undermine European peace. If our two countries resolutely fulfill the common obligation to prevent German militarism from launching new aggression, then the peace and security of the people of Europe will be guaranteed.
    Next, Puzanov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, delivered a report on "The Tenth Anniversary of the Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the French Republic."
    In his report, Puzanov first explained the importance of cooperation between the Soviet and French people from historical facts, as well as the important significance of the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance for ensuring the security of the Soviet Union and France and for maintaining world peace. He said that the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance is an important development in the lives of the people of the Soviet Union and France, and also an important development in the lives of the people of Europe. The main purpose of this treaty is to avoid the threat of aggression from German militarism. At present, international aggressors are fanatically taking measures to restore West German militarism, in which case the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance is of particularly great significance.
    Puzanov said that at present, French official representatives are determined to get the French parliament to approve the Paris Agreement arbitrarily decided by the American aggressors, which violates the basic and vital interests of France. This agreement runs the risk of making the French people return to the isolation policy that once brought national catastrophe to France. If this agreement is approved, France will become an ally of German militarists, a situation that is naturally incompatible with France's status as an ally of the Soviet Union as stipulated in the Franco-Soviet Treaty. The ratification of the Paris Agreement will undoubtedly open the way for the revival of German militarism, will undoubtedly greatly complicate the situation in Europe as a whole, and will exclude the possibility of reaching an agreement on the German question.
    Puzanov emphasized that we are deeply convinced that a quick solution to the German question is in the interests of both France and the Soviet Union. We are deeply convinced that the freedom-loving French people are opposed to the harmful Paris Agreement. The French public and the Soviet people unanimously believe that peace can only be consolidated through the joint efforts of all European countries - regardless of their social and political systems.
    Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, also delivered a long speech at the meeting (see page 4 of today's newspaper).
    Also speaking at the meeting were Soviet Academy of Sciences Academician Vinogradov, writer Ehrenburg, female writer Anna Karavaeva, and Smirnova, a female worker from the "Three Mountains" Textile Factory in Moscow.
    After the meeting, a grand artistic performance was held.

### 法苏同盟互助条约签订十周年  莫斯科举行纪念大会

    法苏同盟互助条约签订十周年
    莫斯科举行纪念大会
   【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联拥护和平委员会、全苏工会中央理事会、苏联对外文化协会、苏联科学院、苏联作家协会、苏联妇女反法西斯委员会和苏联青年反法西斯委员会等机构，十日在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅联合举行大会，纪念法苏同盟互助条约签订十周年。
    参加大会的共有两千多人。法国驻苏联大使路易·约克斯和各国驻苏联的外交使节以及现在正在莫斯科的法国作家路易·阿拉贡和艾尔莎·特丽奥勒也应邀参加了大会。
    大会主席台上悬挂着苏联和法国的国旗。正中间是用俄文和法文写的口号：“苏法两国人民有利于巩固和平的友谊合作万岁！”两旁闪耀着“一九四四—一九五四”几个金色大字。
    当苏联共产党和政府的领导人布尔加宁、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克等在主席台上就座时，到会者报以热烈的、经久不息的掌声。
    大会由全苏工会中央理事会主席什维尔尼克主持。他在开会词中着重谈到了法苏同盟互助条约的意义。他说，今天，当我们纪念符合我们两国人民的切身重大利益的同盟互助条约签订十周年的时候，某些国家，首先是美国的统治集团却在指望借助于制造欧洲紧张局势和加深新的世界大战威胁的所谓巴黎和伦敦协定，来复活侵略性的德国军国主义。十分清楚，如果法国和苏联今后共同遵守同盟互助条约，共同按照这个条约的精神寻求保障自己的外部安全的道路，那么就没有人敢破坏欧洲和平。如果我们两国十分坚决地履行共同防止德国军国主义发动新侵略的义务，那么欧洲各国人民的和平和安全就会得到保证。
    接着，俄罗斯联邦部长会议主席普扎诺夫在会上作了关于“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和法兰西共和国同盟互助条约十周年”的报告。
    普扎诺夫在报告中首先从历史事实中说明苏联和法国人民之间的合作的重要性，以及法苏同盟互助条约对保证苏联和法国两国的安全、对维护世界和平的重要意义。他说，法苏同盟互助条约是苏联和法国两国人民生活中的一个重要发展，也是欧洲各国人民生活中的一个重要发展。这个条约的主要目的是避免德国军国主义的侵略威胁。目前国际侵略分子正在狂热地采取措施以恢复西德军国主义，在这种情况下，法苏同盟互助条约更有着特别巨大的重要意义。
    普扎诺夫说，目前法国官方代表坚决要使法国议会批准美国侵略分子独断决定的巴黎协定，这是违反法国的基本切身利益的。这个协定有使法国人民回到一度使法国遭到民族浩劫的那个孤立政策上去的危险。这个协定如果得到批准，法国将成为德国军国主义者的一个盟友，这种情况自然是同法苏条约中所规定的法国是苏联的一个盟友的地位不相容的。批准巴黎协定，这无疑将为德国军国主义的复活打开道路，无疑将使整个欧洲局势大大复杂起来，并且排除了在德国问题上取得协议的可能性。
    普扎诺夫着重说，我们深信，迅速解决德国问题是对法国和苏联都有利的。我们深信，爱好自由的法国人民是反对有害的巴黎协定的。法国公众和苏联人民一致相信，只有在所有的欧洲国家——不管它们的社会和政治制度如何——进行共同努力的情况下，和平才能巩固。
    苏联部长会议第一副主席、苏联外交部长莫洛托夫也在会上发表了长篇演说（见本报今日第四版）。
    在会上讲话的，还有苏联科学院院士维诺格拉多夫、作家爱伦堡、女作家安·卡拉瓦耶娃和莫斯科“三山”纺织厂女工斯米尔诺娃等。
    大会结束后，并举行了盛大的艺术表演会。
