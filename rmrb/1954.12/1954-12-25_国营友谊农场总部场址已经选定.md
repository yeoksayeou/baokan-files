    The site for the headquarters of the State-Run Friendship Farm has been selected.
    [Our Newspaper] A bright five-star red flag was raised on the snow-covered grassland eight kilometers northeast of Sandaogang. This place has been selected as the site for the headquarters of the State-Run Friendship Farm. It is located in the middle of the farm site, in the center of the farm's cultivated land. On this hundred-hectare wasteland, rows of buildings will appear next year, becoming the nerve center for directing the farm's production. At the same time, roads leading to various sub-farms will also be laid from here.
    On the 21st, the State-Run Friendship Farm held a flag-raising ceremony to mark the selection of the farm headquarters site. Attending the ceremony were members of the Construction Committee of the State-Run Friendship Farm, farm officials, responsible comrades from the local People's Government, Soviet experts serving as farm advisors, Soviet experts from the land consolidation survey team, and surveying personnel. After the flag was raised, the Soviet experts enthusiastically shook hands with the farm director to congratulate him.
    Prior to this, in the central area of the farm site, four pieces of grassland that were more suitable for the site had been selected for detailed surveying and investigation. Based on conditions such as topography, terrain, groundwater level and water quality, and ease of transportation, comparisons were made. Soviet experts and Chinese staff, after more than 20 days of repeated discussions and research, and multiple on-site inspections, finally selected this location. It has many advantages: flat terrain, high ground, convenient drainage, and a relatively low groundwater level. To select this excellent site, the responsible comrades of the Construction Committee of the State-Run Friendship Farm, the farm director's advisor, Soviet expert Nikolenko, the chief agricultural technician, Krukov, and others, had repeatedly visited the site for inspection.
   [Another Dispatch] Survey team members buried the last batch of wooden stakes marking the measurement boundaries. Young draftsmen used red and blue pencils to mark the newly revised boundaries of the farm on the topographic map. The measurement work of the farm boundaries and site area of the State-Run Friendship Farm has been basically completed. Now, with the selection of the site for the general headquarters, the measurement work for the headquarters and internal road lines has begun.
    The land consolidation work of the State-Run Friendship Farm began in mid-November. For more than 30 days, although there have been eight or nine winter snowfalls, and the temperature has dropped to minus 20 to 33 degrees Celsius, all work is still proceeding as planned. While completing the boundary measurement, the main soil types of the entire farm have been investigated, 59 test pits have been observed, detailed profile analysis and records have been made for the soil samples taken, and the soil survey was completed at the beginning of December and moved to indoor work. Now, the classification and sorting of the soil has also been completed, and the soil map has begun to be drawn.
    The water conservancy team has completed the observation and water sampling of 114 underground pits and test wells distributed in various areas of the site, and the measurement of 79 kilometers of precision leveling. The investigation of flood data of the existing flood control dikes and drainage projects of the Qixing River, which are closely related to the farm, and the flood data of five small rivers such as the Qixing River and the Bianshi River, has also been completed. The drilling of deep wells at the headquarters and the selection of new dike construction projects for five small rivers such as the Bianshi River and the Qixing River near the site are now continuing.

    国营友谊农场总部场址已经选定
    【本报讯】一面鲜艳的五星红旗在三道岗东北八公里的白雪覆盖着的草地上升起。这里，已被选定为国营友谊农场总部场址。它位于农场场址的中腰，农场耕地的中心，在这块一百公顷的荒地上，明年即将出现成排的建筑物，成为农场指挥生产的神经中枢；同时还要从这里铺设起通向各个分场的道路等。
    二十一日，国营友谊农场举行了选定农场总部场址的升旗仪式，参加这次仪式的有国营友谊农场建场委员会委员，农场负责人员，当地人民政府的负责同志，农场顾问苏联专家，土地整理考察组的苏联专家和勘测人员。升旗后，苏联专家热烈向场长握手祝贺。
    在此以前，在农场场地的中心地区，曾选出了四块较为适宜场址的草地，进行详细勘测和调查，并根据地形、地势、地下水位和水质以及交通是否方便等条件进行比较，苏联专家和中国工作人员一起，经过二十多天的反复讨论和研究，多次去现场考察，最后才选定这个地方。这里有许多优越条件：地形平坦、地势较高、排水方便、地下水位比较低。为选择这个优良场址，国营友谊农场建场委员会的负责同志，场长顾问苏联专家尼科连科，农业总技师克鲁基科夫等都曾多次到现场考察。
   【又讯】测量队员埋下了最后一批测量报界的木桩，年轻的绘图员用红蓝铅笔在地形图上标出了新修订的农场四界，国营友谊农场场界和场地面积的测量工作已基本完成了。现在，随着总场部场址的选定，已开始了场部和场内道路线的测量工作。
    国营友谊农场的土地整理工作是从十一月中旬开始的。三十多天来，虽然下了八九次冬雪，气温已下降到摄氏零下二十多度到三十三度，但各项工作仍按照预定计划照常进行。在完成场界测量的同时，已重点调查了全场的主要土壤类型，观察了五十九个试坑，对取出的土样进行了详细的剖面分析和纪录，并在十二月初结束了土壤调查转入室内工作。现在，土壤的分类和整理也已完成，并开始绘制土壤图。
    水利小组已完成了分布在场地各区一百一十四个地下坑与试井的观察和取水样的工作，和七十九公里的精密水准的测量，与农场有密切关系的七星河旧有防洪堤防及排水工程，七星河及扁石河等五条小河洪水资料调查工作也已完成了。现正继续进行场部深井钻探和场地附近扁石河等五条小河及七星河新筑堤防工程选线等工作。
