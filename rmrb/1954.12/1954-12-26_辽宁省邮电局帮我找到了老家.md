The Liaoning Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau Helped Me Find My Old Home

To the Editor:

This June, I saw in the People's Daily a news item about the Postal and Telecommunications Bureau helping a woman who had been away from home for seventeen years find her family. I was deeply moved at the time, and a glimmer of hope also rose in my heart, because I, too, had not known the whereabouts of my old home for twenty-two years.

My old home is in Xiaozhaimen Village, Ciyutuo Township, Liaozhong County, Liaoning Province. When I was six years old, because my family was very poor and could not make a living, my parents took my younger brother and me to Guannei (the area south of the Great Wall) to seek a livelihood. In fact, in the old society, it was difficult for poor people wherever they went. Our family wandered the streets, begging for a living. Unfortunately, my father became ill, and because we had no money for treatment, he died not long after. When I was nine years old, my younger brother also died. My mother was both sad and bitter, and coupled with the lack of a means of living, she soon passed away. I was left, an orphan with no father, no mother, and no one to rely on. In Guannei, I herded sheep for people, did odd jobs, and worked long hours, suffering all kinds of oppression and hardship. It wasn't until 1948 that I finally escaped the abyss and joined the People's Liberation Army.

Not being able to find one's home is always a knot in one's heart. In the old society, in order to find my home, I wrote many letters time and time again, but they either disappeared without a trace or were returned unopened. Last year, I saw the fact that a woman who had been unable to find her home for seventeen years had actually found it again, which rekindled hope in me. So, with a tentative attitude, I wrote a letter to the Liaoning Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau.

A month later, good news came – the Liaoning Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Bureau had helped me find my home, which I hadn't known the whereabouts of for twenty-two years! It turned out that after they received my letter, they treated this matter as a task and distributed it level by level. Finally, Comrade Li Yucheng of the Ciyutuo Postal and Telecommunications Office received this task. Comrade Li first discussed it with his colleagues in the office, and then constantly inquired from the old man who sent the letter. After some twists and turns, he finally found my grandfather, Yang Chuntai. When my grandfather first heard that his grandson, who had been out of contact for more than twenty years, had been found, he was so moved that he said repeatedly, "If it weren't for the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could my grandson, who hasn't been heard from for more than twenty years, have been found!"

Now I have gone back to see my grandfather. He cried and laughed when he saw me, and the surrounding masses were also very moved, saying: The people's country truly serves the people; in the old society, who would care about that!

I sincerely thank the new service spirit of the Liaoning Provincial Postal and Telecommunications staff. I am a revolutionary soldier, and I will work harder to study politics, culture, and military technology, to defend every inch of the motherland's territory, and to defend the motherland's socialist construction!

    辽宁省邮电局帮我找到了老家编辑同志：
    今年六月，我在人民日报上看到邮电局给一个离家十七年的妇女找到了家的消息，当时我非常感动，而且一线希望也在心头升起。因为我也有二十二年不知道老家的下落了。
    我的老家在辽宁省辽中县茨榆坨乡萧寨门村。当我六岁那年，因为家里非常贫苦，无法生活，父母就带着我和弟弟到关内谋生活。其实，在旧社会穷人走到那里都是困难，我们一家大小流浪街头、讨饭过活。不幸的是父亲生了病，因为没钱医治，没有多久就死了。到我九岁那年，弟弟也死了，母亲又悲又苦，加上生活无着，很快就去世了。丢下我一个无父无母、无依无靠的孤儿，在关内给人家放羊、打短工、扛长活，受尽了压迫，吃尽了苦头。好容易熬到一九四八年我才跳出了火坑，参加了人民解放军。
  一个人找不着家心里总是个疙瘩。在旧社会，为了找自己的家，我曾经一次又一次地写了好多封信，结果不是石沉大海，就是被原封原样地退了回来。去年我看到一个十七年找不到家的妇女竟然又找到了家的事实，给我重新燃起了希望。于是我带着试试看的心情，给辽宁省邮电局去了一封信。
    过了一个月，喜讯来了——辽宁省邮电局已经替我找到了二十二年不知道下落的家！原来他们接到我的信后，就把这件事当做一个任务逐级分配下去，最后，茨榆坨邮电所李玉成同志接到了这个任务。李同志先和所内同志们研究，然后又不断地向寄信的老大爷打听，经过一番周折，终于把我的祖父杨春泰找着了。我的祖父乍一听见二十多年的孙子有了下落，感动得连声说：“要不是共产党和毛主席的好领导，我二十多年没有音信的孙子那里会找得着！”
    现在我已经回去看过我祖父了。他看见了我又哭又笑，周围的群众也很感动，说：人民的国家才真正为人民办事；要在旧社会，谁管你那一套！
    我衷心地感谢辽宁省邮电工作人员新的服务精神。我是一个革命军人，我要更加努力学习政治、文化和军事技术，保卫祖国的每一寸领土，保卫祖国的社会主义建设！
