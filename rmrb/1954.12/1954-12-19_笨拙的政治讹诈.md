Clumsy Political Blackmail

Premier and Foreign Minister of China Zhou Enlai agreed to meet with UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld in Beijing to discuss relevant issues. This is another effort by the Chinese government to ease international tensions. However, U.S. Senator Alexander Wiley sees this as a good opportunity for the United States to engage in political blackmail.

Wiley said on the 17th that he hoped Zhou Enlai's agreement to meet with Hammarskjöld "means that vision and reason will prevail," enabling the release of the eleven American spies. He also threatened that otherwise, "the United Nations needs to take action." He said this meant taking land, sea, and air action.

What an arrogant American senator, actually wanting to use the threat of war to force the Chinese people to release American spies who have violated China's sovereignty and security!

But can the Chinese people be intimidated by war?

On this issue, it seems that it is Wiley himself who needs a little "vision and reason," not others.

The Chinese people have not only witnessed American war threats, but also American war actions—the land, sea, and air aggression in Korea under the guise of the United Nations flag. What was the result? Wiley should know very well. If the American aggressive bloc dares to launch another war action against the Chinese people, whether it is directly in the name of the United States or again under the guise of the United Nations, the result will be more than just a bloody nose.

If Wiley has a sound memory, he may wish to think about what he himself said just six days ago. In a letter to the Veterans of Foreign Wars Association of Brown County, Wisconsin, on December 12, Wiley said that "risking a world war in which ten million, twenty million, or thirty million Americans might die in order to secure the release of thirteen American spies is not only an absurd policy, but also a self-defeating policy."

But only five days later, as soon as he saw that Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai had agreed to meet with Hammarskjöld, this senator actually became so carried away that he played the hero and wanted to scare the Chinese people with war. This kind of political blackmail is too absurd and too clumsy.

The Chinese people's position on the issue of punishing American spies has been clearly stated in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's telegram to Hammarskjöld. The verdicts against the American spies are based on conclusive and irrefutable evidence. This is entirely the exercise of national sovereignty by the Chinese government, and no foreign or international organization has the right to interfere. Neither the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly manipulated by the United States, nor Wiley's war cries, can possibly make the Chinese people change their firm position. Wiley and the big and small Wileys in the United States had better be more "reasonable"!

    笨拙的政治讹诈
    新华社评论员　江南
    我国总理兼外交部长周恩来同意在北京接见联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，商谈有关的各项问题。这是中国政府为了缓和国际紧张局势而作的又一次努力。可是美国参议员亚历山大·维利却把这看作是美国进行政治讹诈的一个好机会。
    维利在十七日说，他希望周恩来同意接见哈马舍尔德“意味着见识和理智将占上风”，而使十一名美国间谍能够得到释放。他还恫吓说，否则的话，“联合国就需要采取行动了”。他说，这就是要采取陆海空军行动。
    好一个狂妄的美国参议员，竟然想拿战争威胁来压迫中国人民释放侵犯了中国的主权和安全的美国间谍！
    但是，难道中国人民是可以用战争来吓倒的吗？
    在这个问题上，看来需要一点“见识和理智”的，不是别人而倒是维利自己。
    中国人民不但见识过美国的战争威胁，而且还见识过美国的战争行动——盗用联合国旗帜在朝鲜的陆海空军侵略行动。结果怎么样呢？维利应该知道得很清楚。如果美国侵略集团胆敢再对中国人民来一次战争行动，不管它是直接用美国的名义，或者是再次盗用联合国的名义，其结果将不仅只是碰得头破血流而已。
    如果维利还有健全的记忆的话，他不妨想一想仅仅六天以前他自己说过的话。维利十二月十二日在一封给威斯康星州布朗县国外战争退伍军人协会的信中说，为了使十三名美国间谍释放而“冒一场可能有一千万、两千万或三千万美国人民死亡的世界大战的危险，这不但是一种荒谬的政策，而且也是自招失败的政策”。
    但是仅仅五天之后，一看到周恩来外长同意接见哈马舍尔德，这位参议员就居然忘其所以，充起好汉来，想拿战争来吓唬中国人民。这种政治讹诈，未免太荒唐、太笨拙了。
    中国人民在惩办美国间谍问题上的立场，已经在周恩来外长给哈马舍尔德的电报中清楚地申明了。对美国间谍的判决是证据确凿、无可抵赖的。这完全是中国政府行使国家主权，任何外国或国际组织无权干涉。无论是美国操纵联合国大会通过的决议，无论是维利的战争叫嚣，都决不可能使中国人民改变自己的坚定的立场。维利和美国大大小小像维利这样的人还是“理智”点好！
