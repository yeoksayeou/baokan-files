Dear friends and comrades!
    Please allow me, on behalf of the Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the government, to extend to you, and through you, to the heroic Albanian people, warm greetings and congratulations on the tenth anniversary of the national liberation of Albania from the fascist occupiers.
    Ten years ago, the Albanian people, taking advantage of the favorable situation of the Soviet army's victory in the Balkans, completely liberated their country from the fascist bandits and foreign occupation.
    You won this glorious victory in bloody battles, in establishing great sacrifices and merits. Your people are very fond of calling their motherland the "Land of Eagles." From such a title, the Albanian people's love of freedom and self-respect are expressed. For many centuries, the Albanian people have bravely and fearlessly fought for their independence and against foreign enslavers.
    During the Second World War, the fascist occupiers attempted once again to enslave your homeland. Under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people waged a heroic struggle against the enemy and made their contribution to the common cause of defeating European fascism.
    The Soviet people cherish the heroic struggle of the Albanian people for their independence, and they will never forget the great sacrifices suffered by the Albanian people during the Second World War.
    Comrades! It has been ten years since your country was liberated, which is only a short period in the history of a country. However, everyone knows that revolution greatly accelerates the process of social development. Everyone also knows that liberated people are capable of creating miracles, whereas in the past, the creativity of the people was constrained.
    What kind of country was Albania ten to fifteen years ago? It was a backward, feudal-style country in which, in addition to the sprouts of capitalism, considerable remnants of the clan system remained. Agriculture was at a very low level. The land was in the hands of landlords and rich peasants. If we do not count the very few industrial enterprises belonging to foreign capitalists, there was almost no modern industry.
    The people were in a state of poverty. The ruling clique and foreign colonialists did not care about the needs of the people, nor about the people's education and culture. The fact that illiteracy in Albania accounted for 80 percent of the national population in 1939 is enough to illustrate how dire the situation was at that time.
    Since the Albanian people freed themselves from the enslavement of landlords, capitalists, foreign imperialists, and colonialists and lived independently, since they have been living a free, laboring, and creative life, working for themselves and for their country, the face of Albania has fundamentally changed.
    People's Albania is advancing rapidly along the road of economic and cultural upsurge. The sown area is constantly increasing, the level of cultivation is constantly improving, and the latest agricultural technology methods are increasingly penetrating the Albanian countryside.
    The young Albanian agricultural production cooperatives have achieved remarkable results, vividly demonstrating the superiority of collective forms in agricultural management, and they are the initiators of adopting advanced agricultural technology methods. Before the establishment of the people's government, many industrial products in your country had to be imported from foreign countries. New Albania has established many enterprises equipped with the latest technology, producing textiles, leather, sugar, furniture, and domestically produced tobacco products for the residents. The metallurgical industry is also beginning to develop.
    The Hoxha factory in Tirana produces various agricultural tools for the countryside. The country is realizing electrification. Electric lights not only illuminate the cities but also begin to illuminate the countryside that has lived in darkness for centuries. On the basis of industrial development, the leading force of People's Albania—the working class—has grown and strengthened.
    Your country has achieved particularly remarkable achievements in national education and culture. It should be said that the culture of pre-war Albania simply cannot be compared with the present.
    In the past, Albania did not have a single institution of higher learning. Now, your country has six institutions of higher learning. An Academy of Sciences has also been established. Albanian cultural and social welfare institutions are growing rapidly. The country already has its own people's intellectuals.
    The entire life of People's Albania eloquently illustrates that the Albanian people have stood up and are proudly striding forward shoulder to shoulder with other democratic countries along the path of progress and socialism.
    After your country was liberated, thanks to the development of democratic freedoms and the improvement of the cultural and knowledge level of the residents, the lowest strata of the people were all mobilized and began to move towards a conscious and active political life. Many people who were deprived of all rights in the past have now become representatives of the People's Assembly, holding important positions in government organs and party organizations, serving as factory directors, cooperative chairmen, agronomists, engineers, and scientists. At the same time, the creative initiative of the masses has been greatly developed, their political awareness has been raised, socialist emulation has been launched, the movement of advanced producers and innovators has been promoted, and achievements have been made in amateur groups, art, and sports.
    The changes in the status of Albanian women are particularly significant. In old Albania, women were rightless slaves, and in some places, they were even treated as objects of trade. Now, Albanian women are completely equal to men, and they are active builders of the new life. Before the war, 90 percent of Albanian women were illiterate. Since the establishment of the people's government, hundreds of thousands of women have learned to read and write. Many girls are also studying in institutions of higher learning.
    All these facts prove the tremendous changes and great achievements that have taken place in your country's economic, political, and cultural life.
    Comrades! The heroic Albanian Labor Party, headed by the Central Committee of the Labor Party, is the guiding and leading force of the Albanian people in the struggle to build a new and happy life.
    In the years of war tests, the Albanian communists led their people to defeat the enemy. In the years of peaceful construction, the Labor Party has made every effort to develop Albania's economy and culture for the benefit of the working people, and to continuously improve the welfare of the Albanian people on the basis of economic upswing.
    Naturally, in such an undertaking as building a new socialist economy and culture, difficulties will inevitably be encountered. These are difficulties in advancing. But there is no doubt that the condition of the Albanian people is improving every year, they are living better today than yesterday, and they will live better tomorrow than today.
    Comrades! The Soviet people deeply sympathize with the hardworking and brave Albanian people who are building a socialist society, and they pay close attention to your cause with sympathy and are sincerely delighted with your achievements. A close fraternal friendship built on a solid and sound foundation connects the people of our two countries, our common goals and the common path we both follow unite us. The common struggle for peace unites us. Albania and the Soviet Union are both peaceful and democratic countries that have absolutely no aggressive intentions. The people of our two countries hope to live in peace and friendship with the people of all countries, and the foreign policies of Albania and the Soviet Union are entirely subordinate to this noble purpose.
    The unremitting struggle for world peace waged by the democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union has yielded not bad results. As everyone knows, the extremely dangerous Korean war was extinguished. The arduous and bloody war in Indochina, which lasted for eight years, has ended. This is the first time since the end of World War II that there is no bloodshed and no sound of gunfire anywhere in the world.
    These victories strengthen the confidence of peace-loving people of all countries: aggressors can be stopped, and peace will surely triumph over war.
    We will continue to spare no effort to fight for the consolidation of peace, for the collective security and cooperation of all countries.
    Comrades! On this day of your national day, on behalf of the Soviet people, we warmly congratulate you on achieving further achievements in building socialist Albania, consolidating the people's democratic system, improving the welfare of the working people, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and striving for peace and the security of all countries.
    Long live the free and independent People's Republic of Albania!
    Long live the organizer and inspirer of all victories of the Albanian people—the Albanian Labor Party!
    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between Albania and the Soviet Union!

### 在阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年庆祝大会上  瓦·加·热沃隆科夫同志的讲话

    在阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年庆祝大会上
    瓦·加·热沃隆科夫同志的讲话亲爱的朋友们和同志们！
    请允许我代表苏联人民、苏联共产党和政府向你们并通过你们向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民致以热烈的敬礼和祝贺，祝贺阿尔巴尼亚击败法西斯占领者全国解放十周年。
    十年前阿尔巴尼亚人民利用苏军在巴尔干取得胜利的有利局势，把国家从法西斯强盗手中和外国占领下完全解放了出来。
    你们是在流血战斗中、在树立牺牲重大的功勋中赢得了这一辉煌胜利的。你们的人民极爱把自己的祖国称为“鹰之国”。从这样一个称呼中表现出阿尔巴尼亚人民热爱自由和自尊的气魄。阿尔巴尼亚人民许多世纪来一直英勇无畏地为争取自己的独立、反对外国奴役者而奋斗。
    在第二次世界大战期间，法西斯占领者企图再一次奴役你们的祖国。阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚共产党的领导下对敌人作了英勇的斗争，并且在击溃欧洲法西斯主义的共同事业中作出了自己的贡献。
    苏联人民十分珍视阿尔巴尼亚人民为争取自己的独立而进行的英勇奋斗，他们永远也不会忘记阿尔巴尼亚人民在第二次世界大战期间所遭到的重大的牺牲。
    同志们！你们国家解放已有十年了，这在一国的历史上不过是一个短短的时期。但是，大家知道，革命大大加速了社会发展的进程。大家还知道，解放了的人民是能够创造奇迹的，而在过去，人民的创造力是受到束缚的。
    在十年—十五年以前，阿尔巴尼亚是一个什么样的国家呢？这是一个封建型式的落后国家，在这个国家中，除了资本主义的萌芽以外，还保持了氏族制度的相当大的残余。农业处于非常低下的水平。土地掌握在地主和富农的手中。如果不算外国资本家所属的极少数的工业企业的话，几乎没有现代工业。
    人民处在贫困的境地。统治集团和外国殖民者毫不关心人民的需要，人民的教育和文化。在一九三九年，阿尔巴尼亚的文盲占全国居民的百分之八十，这件事实就足以说明当时的情况恶劣到什么地步。
    自从阿尔巴尼亚人民摆脱地主、资本家、外国帝国主义者和殖民者的奴役而独立生活时起，自从他们过着自由、劳动和创造性的生活，为自己和为自己的国家劳动的时候起，阿尔巴尼亚的面貌就根本地改变了。
    人民阿尔巴尼亚沿着经济和文化迅速高涨的道路前进。播种面积不断增加，耕作水平不断提高，最新农业耕作技术方法日益深入阿尔巴尼亚的农村。
  年青的阿尔巴尼亚农业生产合作社获得了显著的成绩，鲜明地表明农业经营中集体形式的优越性，它们是采用先进的农业技术方法的倡导者。在建立人民政权以前，你们国家许多工业品都要从外国输入。新阿尔巴尼亚建立了许多装备有最新技术设备的企业，为居民生产纺织品、皮革、糖、家具和本国出产的烟类制品。冶金工业也在开始发展。
    地拉那霍查工厂为农村生产各种农业工具。国家在实现电气化。电灯不仅照亮城市，而且开始照亮许多世纪生活在黑暗中的农村。在发展工业的基础上，人民阿尔巴尼亚的领导力量——工人阶级增长并加强了。
    你们国家在国民教育和文化方面获得了特别显著的成就。应当说，战前阿尔巴尼亚的文化简直不能和现在的相比。
    过去，阿尔巴尼亚没有一所高等学校。现在，你们国家有六所高等学校。还建立了一个科学院。阿尔巴尼亚文化和社会福利机构在迅速地增长。国家已有了自己的人民的知识分子。
    人民阿尔巴尼亚的全部生活雄辩地说明：阿尔巴尼亚人民已经站立起来了，并且和其他民主国家并肩沿着进步和社会主义的道路骄傲地大踏步地前进。
    当你们国家解放之后，由于发展了民主自由和提高了居民的文化和知识水平，人民的最底层一下子都动了起来，并且开始走向自觉的和积极的政治生活。许多过去被剥夺了一切权利的人今天已成为人民议会的代表，担当了政府机关和党组织的重要职务，当了厂长、合作社主席、农艺师、工程师、科学家。同时也大大发挥了人民群众的创造性的主动精神，提高了他们的政治觉悟，展开了社会主义竞赛，促成了生产先进者和革新者运动，促成了在业余团体、艺术和体育方面取得成绩。
    阿尔巴尼亚妇女的地位发生的变化特别大。在旧阿尔巴尼亚、妇女是没有权利的奴隶，有些地方甚至把她们当作买卖的对象。现在，阿尔巴尼亚妇女已完全和男子平等，她们是新生活的积极建设者。战前有百分之九十的阿尔巴尼亚妇女是不识字的。自从人民政权建立以来，已有数十万妇女学会了读书写字。许多女孩子还在高等学校学习。
    这一切事实都证明你们国家在经济、政治和文化生活中起了巨大变化和取得了巨大成绩。
    同志们！以劳动党中央委员会为首的英勇的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是阿尔巴尼亚人民在建设新的幸福生活的斗争中的指导和领导力量。
    在战争考验的年代中，阿尔巴尼亚的共产党人领导本国的人民战胜了敌人。在和平建设的年代中，劳动党又竭尽一切力量使阿尔巴尼亚的经济和文化为了劳动人民的利益向前发展，在经济高涨的基础上不断提高阿尔巴尼亚人民的福利。
    自然，在建设新的社会主义经济和文化这样的事业中，必然也会碰到困难。这是前进中的困难。但是没有任何疑问，阿尔巴尼亚人民的状况每一年都在改善着，他们今天比昨天生活得好些，而明天将比今天生活得更好。
    同志们！苏联人民十分同情正在建设社会主义社会的勤劳勇敢的阿尔巴尼亚人民，苏联人民怀着同情心密切关怀你们的事业，并且对你们的成就感到衷心的喜悦。建立在巩固和健全基础上的亲密兄弟友谊把我们两国人民联系在一起，我们共同的目的和我们两国所走的共同的道路把我们团结起来。争取和平的共同斗争把我们团结起来。阿尔巴尼亚和苏联都是绝对没有任何侵略企图的和平民主国家。我们两国人民都希望同各国人民和平友好地相处，阿尔巴尼亚和苏联的外交政策都完全服从于这一崇高的目的。
    以苏联为首的民主力量为世界和平而进行的坚持不渝的斗争已有了不坏的成果。大家知道，极为危险的朝鲜战火被扑灭了。持续八年之久的印度支那艰苦的流血战争结束了。第二次世界大战结束后，世界上没有一处流血、没有一处听见炮声，现在还是第一次。
    这些胜利加强了爱好和平的各国人民的信心：侵略者是可阻止住的，和平一定战胜战争。
    我们今后仍将不遗余力地为巩固和平、为各国人民的集体安全和合作而斗争。
    同志们！在你们的国庆节这一天，我们代表苏联人民，热烈祝贺你们在建设社会主义阿尔巴尼亚、在巩固人民民主制度、提高劳动人民的福利、巩固工农联盟、争取和平和各国安全这些方面获得进一步的成就。
    自由的、独立的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民一切胜利的组织者和鼓舞者——阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚和苏联之间的永恒的、牢不可破的友谊万岁！
