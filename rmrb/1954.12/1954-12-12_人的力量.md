    The Power of People
    By our reporter Bai Yuan
    In a thatched house at the Boshan Reservoir. It was snowing outside. Across a mud-plastered coal stove from me sat a young man. After answering each of my questions, he would always gaze at me for a long time with his simple, even childish eyes, as if to repeatedly say, "That's how it is," and to make me believe his simple answers. This was a person not good at talking about himself in front of others, not just out of humility, but because, in his view, things were indeed so simple.
    I had to ask him sentence by sentence, to clarify what had happened:
    That day, Shi Jiuming and another soldier named Jin Jinqing were operating a water pump next to the reservoir dam, pumping water from the water diversion tunnel inlet to wash the sand used for mixing concrete. After Shi Jiuming came to the reservoir construction site with the army to participate in the reservoir's construction project, he learned to operate the water pump on the site. At first, a technician named Yan Qin taught them as apprentices. Now, Shi Jiuming was a soldier and a fourth-grade worker, able to operate the water pump himself. But that day, as he and Jin Jinqing were operating the water pump, they felt something was wrong with the machine: the oil in the pump's oil tank was being consumed much faster than usual. So they checked the oil tank, but there was no leak. They then disassembled the nozzle of the oil tank and saw that it was because the machine had been used for too long, and the oil hole in the small oil base plate inside the nozzle had been enlarged by the oil.
    After work that day, Shi Jiuming told Yan Qin about the situation. Later, Yan Qin and Shi Jiuming disassembled the nozzle and looked at it again. Yan Qin said, "This is troublesome, we have to find a way to get a replacement from Shanghai!"
    The next day, it was Shi Jiuming's turn to be on duty in the army. After finishing his shift at the camp on the hill where we are now talking, he ran to the construction site alone and picked up three short pieces of scrap steel that had been sawn off and left on the ground in a rebar yard where rebar was being tied. He put these three pieces of scrap steel in his pocket and was about to walk back when he ran into Yan Qin next to the rebar yard.
      "Master Yan, I want to make something, do you think it's possible?"
      "What is it?"
      "The oil base plate for the nozzle. Didn't you say you have to get a replacement from Shanghai? It's such a small thing, I want to try it... I'm just afraid it will be hard to drill the hole."
      "Yes. How do you plan to do it?"
    "I want to try... Do you think we can drill through it with a needle?"
    Yan Qin laughed when he heard this. But the laugh didn't have any mocking meaning. It was a solemn smile, the way people smile when they encounter something that surprises them.
      "But that thing has to be made of steel," Yan Qin said.
    "Do you think this will work?" Shi Jiuming reached into his pocket and took out the three pieces of scrap steel he had picked up.
      "Then try it. When you make it, first heat the steel red-hot, then let it cool down. This will reduce its hardness and make it easier to work with," Yan Qin told him.
    They walked together to a shed belonging to Yan Qin's engineering team. Yan Qin found him a file, a hacksaw, and helped him find a missing oil base plate from a nozzle to use as a model. Shi Jiuming took the tools back to the army camp, put a piece of steel into the coal stove and heated it red-hot, and then took it out. He stood there for a while, pondering, then moved a long bench, and found some long iron nails. He embedded one end of the cooled steel piece onto the bench with the iron nails, picked up the hacksaw with one hand, and stepped on the bench with one foot, sawing off three pieces of steel. Then, he compared one of the sawn steel pieces with the missing oil base plate, and filed it round and flat according to its thickness and size, pressing it on the bench with his hand. At this time, Shi Jiuming put all the things together.
    At dusk, he bought two packs of embroidery needles from a department store stall.
    The night passed, and the next morning arrived. Shi Jiuming broke the end of a bamboo chopstick, clamped an embroidery needle in the middle of the chopstick, tied it tightly with rope on the outside, aimed the needle tip at the very center of the small oil base plate, and rubbed the bamboo chopstick with both palms. When the tip of one needle became flat, he replaced it with another. I don't know how long he rubbed, and I don't know how many embroidery needles he replaced. – Under the eternal will of man, why calculate that fleeting time.
    A fierce north wind blew from the wilderness outside the window, swirling the vast expanse of white snowflakes, causing the thatched house we were in to shake and rustle. After the story stopped, Shi Jiuming again looked at me for a long time with his childish, shining eyes. At this time, he took out a small cloth bag from an inside pocket, which contained ten or so sparkling things. These were the oil base plates from the water pump nozzles, each one as big as an ordinary clothing button, but thicker than a button, with a small dot in the very center, almost the size of a needle tip, each one polished shiny, all of them ground by Shi Jiuming by hand on a grindstone. If you held it up vertically with your thumb and forefinger, facing the sunlight, you could see a small ray of light from that small dot of an eye, and then you would believe: due to the will of man, steel can also be pierced with embroidery needles.
      "How come there are so many?" I asked.
    "I only made one at first. I took it to Master Yan and they installed it in the water pump nozzle and it really worked. They told me to keep making them, so I made so many together. Look,..."
    As Shi Jiuming spoke, he poured the shining oil base plates from the small cloth bag into my hands. I held them in both hands, facing the roaring wind and snow outside the thatched house, faintly hearing the noisy sounds of the builders from the reservoir construction site, the rumbling of the machines, which suddenly made me fully understand why people can overturn mountains, transform the earth, and overcome any difficulties. But Shi Jiuming just looked at me for a long time, his young eyes appearing incomparably simple, as if everything had happened so simply and naturally.

    人的力量
    本报记者　白原
    在薄山水库的一间草房子里。外面正下着雪。在我的对面，隔着一个泥糊的煤炭炉子，坐着一个青年人。他在回答过我的每一句话以后，总是用他那一双单纯得甚至带着稚气的眼睛久久地望着我，好像是要重复地对我说，“就是这样”，并且要我相信他的那些简单的回答。这是一个不善于在别人面前讲述自己的事情的人，这还不仅是由于一种谦虚的缘故，而是在他看来，事情确是这样地简单。
    我只得从头一句一句地问他，弄清楚这件事情的经过：
    那一天，史久明和另一个叫金锦青的战士正在水库大坝旁边开抽水机，从输水隧洞进水口那里抽水来洗拌混凝土用的沙子。史久明随着部队到水库的建筑工地上来参加这个水库的建筑工程以后，就在工地上学开抽水机。开始，由一个叫阎钦的技术工人带他们做徒弟。现在，史久明已经是一个战士兼四级工人，能够自己来开抽水机了。可是，这一天，他和金锦青两个人一边在开抽水机，一边就觉着机器有点不对劲：抽水机油箱里的油比往常消耗得快了许多。于是他们就来检查油箱，可是油箱并没有漏油。他们再把油箱的那个喷油嘴拆开一看，原来是因为机器用得太久，喷油嘴里边那一小块油底板的油眼被油冲大了。
    当天下班以后，史久明把这情况告诉阎钦。后来，阎钦又同史久明一起把那个喷油嘴拆开看了一遍。阎钦说：“这一下可麻烦了，得想法到上海去配呢！”
    第二天轮到史久明在部队上值勤。他在我们现在谈话的这个山岗的营地上站完了岗，就一个人跑到了工地上，在一个扎钢筋的钢筋场里拾了三节锯掉在地上的短短的废钢筋。他把这三节废钢筋揣在衣袋里，正要往回走，刚好就在钢筋场的旁边碰到了阎钦。
      “阎师傅，我想做一个东西，你看行不行？”
      “什么东西？”
      “那个喷油嘴的油底板。你不是说要到上海去配？那么一个小东西，我想试试，……就是钻眼怕不好弄。”
      “是的。你想怎么弄？”
    “我想试试看，……你说拿针能不能把它钻通？”
    阎钦一听就笑起来。可是那笑，并没有一点嘲弄的意思。那是一种庄严的微笑，当人们碰到使自己觉得惊奇的事情的时候，就是那样笑着的。
      “可是，那东西一定要拿钢来做才行的，”阎钦说。
    “你看这行不行？”史久明伸手从衣袋里掏出那三节捡来的废钢筋。
      “那你试试看，做的时候，先把钢筋烧红，然后再让它冷了，这样可以减低它的硬度，做起来容易些，”阎钦告诉他说。
    他们一路走着，一起走到了阎钦他们那个工程队的一座工棚里面。阎钦替他在工棚里找了一把锉子，一把钢锯，又帮他找到了一颗缺了的喷油嘴的油底板来做样子。史久明拿着工具回到部队的营房去，把一节钢筋放到煤炭火炉里烧红，然后把它取出来。他站在那里捉摸了一会，搬来了一张长板凳，又找来几颗长铁钉。他把那一节冷了的钢筋的一头用铁钉嵌在板凳上，一只手拿起钢锯，一只脚蹬在板凳上，把钢筋锯下来三块。接着，他拿一块锯下来的钢筋和那一颗缺了的油底板比了比，照它的厚薄大小的样子用手按在板凳上把它锉圆、锉平。这时候，史久明就把所有的东西通通一起收拾起来。
    黄昏时分，他在一个百货摊子上买了两包绣花针。
    过了一夜，到了第二天清早。史久明把一根竹筷子的一头破开，把绣花针夹在筷子当中，在外面用绳子紧紧地捆着，把针尖对准那颗小小的油底板的正中心，就用两只手掌夹着竹筷子搓起来。一根针的针尖钻平了，就换上另一根。也不知道搓了多少时间，也不知道换了多少根绣花针了。——在人的永恒的意志下面，何必去计算那一瞬即逝的时间。
    一阵猛烈的北风从窗外的原野上吹过，把那一片白茫茫的雪花旋卷起来，把我们所在的这间草房子吹得呼呼地抖动着。话一停下，史久明又用他的那一双带着稚气的、闪着光亮的眼睛久久地望着我。这时候，他从一件内衣口袋里掏出一个小小的布包来，布包里包着十来个亮晶晶的东西。这就是抽水机的喷油嘴里边的油底板，每一个就像一颗普通的衣服扣子那么大，可是比扣子还要厚一些，正中间有一小点差不多像针尖那么大小的眼眼，一个个磨得亮光光，都是由史久明用手在磨石上磨的。你如果用拇指和食指把它竖着拿起来，对准阳光，就可以从那一小点眼眼里看见一点小小的光线，这时候你才相信：由于人的意志，钢也可以拿绣花针来穿。
      “怎么有这么多？”我问。
    “开头就只做了一个，拿去给阎师傅他们装到抽水机的喷油嘴里一看，真管用，他们叫我继续做，接着，我就一起做了这许多。你看看，……”
    史久明一边说着，一边就把那一颗颗闪光的油底板从那一个小布包里倒到我的手上。我用双手捧着它们，面对着草房子外面那一片咆哮的风雪，隐隐约约地听着从水库建筑工地上传来的那些建设者们的喧闹的声音，机器的隆隆的响声，使我一下子完全明白了，人为什么能够掀倒山岳，改造大地，战胜任何的艰难。可是，史久明只是那么久久地望着我，一双年轻的眼睛显得无比的单纯，就好像一切都是那么简单、那么自然地发生的一样。
