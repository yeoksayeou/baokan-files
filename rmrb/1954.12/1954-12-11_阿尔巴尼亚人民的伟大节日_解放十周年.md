The Great Festival of the Albanian People – Tenth Anniversary of Liberation
Tu Yakov, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania

November 29, 1954, the Albanian people joyously and excitedly celebrated the first decade of our country’s liberation.

The victory of the National Liberation War on November 29, 1944, is the glorious result of the long-term efforts and struggles of the Albanian people to win freedom, land, and national independence.

The achievement of this great historic victory is due to the fact that the Albanian Communist Party (now the Labor Party) organized and led this struggle for freedom and independence. The liberation of Albania is closely linked to the participation of the glorious Soviet Army. The Soviet Army shattered Hitler's war machine and created conditions for the Albanian National Liberation Army to liberate its own motherland.

The war, which lasted for three years, cost the Albanian people dearly. The Italian and German occupiers committed heinous crimes against our people. They threw children into the fire in front of their mothers. In the war to liberate the motherland, the Albanian people paid a heavy price: more than 28,000 people were sacrificed, 12,600 were injured, 10,000 were imprisoned and looted, 61,000 houses were burned down, and more than one million head of livestock were slaughtered. The fascist occupiers left only ruins. Entire regions were burned to the ground in many places, transportation and telecommunications were cut off, major bridges and docks were blown up, industry suffered losses, transportation was looted, all gold reserves were looted, the purchasing power of paper money plummeted, the state treasury was empty, and famine and unemployment were widespread.

Our brave guerrillas and the National Liberation Army organized ambushes along transportation lines, attacked cities, and engaged in bloody battles with the enemy – the Italian and German occupiers and their servants – in the cities, inflicting disastrous defeats on the enemy and forcing them to retreat. However, the vile blood of these criminals cannot compensate for all the losses they caused to the Albanian people.

The Albanian people, who innocently suffered such great losses, once again shouted loudly on this great historical day: against the fascist beasts and the ruling classes of Albania's past, who betrayed the national cause, colluded with the German occupiers, and participated in all their crimes.

The Albanian people cherish their victory very much and defend it like the apple of their eye, defending their unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union and all the countries of our great peaceful socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. The Albanian people have never had such sincere and powerful friends as they have today, who defend the Albanian people and provide generous assistance in the Albanian people's construction of a new life – the cause of socialism.

The liberation of the country presented important tasks to the Labor Party and the government of the People's Republic of Albania.

At that time, the basic task of the Labor Party was to lead the people based on the specific conditions of our country. It was urgent to revive the country, prepare conditions for a planned economy, develop the social and economic foundations of the new regime, and prepare the foundations for socialist construction, which is the basic task of the transition period from capitalism to socialism. The Party formulated its line according to these tasks. The working masses, united around this line with astonishing enthusiasm for construction and creation, a high degree of patriotism, and unwavering confidence in their cause, advanced at an accelerated pace in the cause of national economic construction, fully demonstrating the qualities that only socialist builders possess. In the shortest period of time, all the scenes of destruction were eliminated, and the country began a normal life.

Through a series of measures, the People's Democratic Government implemented various fundamental economic and social reforms.

The People's Democratic Government abolished foreign privileges, monopolized foreign trade, nationalized banks and transportation, controlled industry, and later abolished capitalist ownership and established a socialist economic sector; established state-owned and cooperative businesses, handicraft cooperatives, levied special taxes on large merchants and entrepreneurs who made fortunes during the war, implemented land reform, abolished landlords' land ownership, and established the socialist agricultural sector.

As a result of the land reform, 70,211 peasant households with little or no land received 172,659 hectares of land, 474,227 olive trees, and 5,923 head of draft animals. The implementation of the land reform forever buried feudalism and was a historic victory for our peasants and all our people.

For the first time in the history of our people, the working masses gained their rights and democratic freedoms. On January 11, 1946, the Constituent Assembly declared Albania a People's Republic and approved the Constitution, which faithfully and correctly reflects the highest interests of our people and the entire country.

Under the leadership of the Party, the political unity of our people, united in the National Liberation Front, has been further consolidated. The recent elections to the People's Assembly, in which more than 99 percent of the voters voted for the candidates of the Democratic Front, are a good proof.

Ten years have passed since liberation. During this period, we have achieved tremendous and multifaceted achievements due to the completion of the tasks set by the Party and the government by the working masses, the comprehensive and constant assistance of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, and the fraternal assistance of various people's democratic countries.

The period since liberation has been a period in which our people have struggled against the defeated enemies and imperialist conspiracies and strived to overcome the enormous difficulties in organizing construction work. Although this has been a period full of efforts and sacrifices, we have successfully overcome it.

The First Party Congress on November 8, 1948, was a decisive turning point for Albania to move forward on the road to socialism. The completion of the tasks of the First Congress and the Two-Year Plan has further developed our country's economy. At the Second Party Congress held on March 31, 1952, our people took new steps forward. The First Five-Year Plan from 1951 to 1955 proposed transforming our country from a backward agricultural country into a country with developed agriculture and industry.

Thanks to the selfless labor of our country's working masses, by the end of 1954, the total industrial output will increase more than eleven times compared to before the war; mineral output will be 5.6 times, oil output will be 4.3 times, food industry output will be 7.5 times, clothing and footwear industry output will be 33.7 times, building industry output producing building materials will be 29 times, and electricity output will be 19 times. Agriculture has also made significant progress. By the end of the Five-Year Plan, the sown area will increase to 169.7 percent of that in 1938. Technical crops that our country did not have before have also been significantly developed. The establishment of machine tractor stations is an important factor in the development of agriculture. The state has established a large number of agricultural and livestock enterprises, and prudent and resolute steps have been taken in establishing agricultural cooperatives.

Commercial and handicraft cooperatives have become powerful assistants to the state-owned economy.

The volume of commodity circulation in 1953 increased to 281 percent of that before the war.

Compared with 1950, residents in 1954 received 56.3 percent more sugar, 81.8 percent more cotton fabrics, 111.8 percent more leather shoes, and 77.8 percent more crude soap.

The income of residents in 1953 increased by 56 percent compared to 1950, while the country's income increased by 29 percent.

Tremendous achievements have also been made in education and culture. Illiteracy, which accounted for more than 80 percent of the population before liberation, has now been almost completely eliminated. Primary education has become compulsory, and the school network has been so universally developed that schools are now available even in the most remote villages. Before liberation, there were only 643 primary schools with 52,000 students and 11 seven-year schools and secondary schools with 6,300 students in Albania; while in the 1954-1955 school year, the number of primary schools reached 2,140 with 136,000 students, and the number of seven-year schools and secondary schools increased to 343 with 48,300 students. The people's regime has opened six institutions of higher learning in our country for the first time. This year, there are 1,200 college students studying in these schools, and hundreds of college students are studying in institutions of higher learning in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. The formation of a new people's intelligentsia is another great victory for the Albanian people.

Culture, art, sports, science, and literature are developing rapidly.

The Party and the government attach special importance to the people's health and allocate a lot of funds to health care every year.

In 1938, there were only eight hospitals with 820 beds in the country. By the end of 1953, there were 49 hospitals with 4,000 beds; in addition, there were 96 obstetrical hospitals and branches with 800 beds, five sanatoriums, ten tuberculosis prevention and treatment centers, and 450 clinics, which were completely non-existent before liberation.

All of the above are the brilliant achievements that our people have made in the ten years since liberation. These achievements are now in a new upsurge and development. In order to fulfill the new tasks set by the Party and the government – to improve the people's material life by accelerating the production of daily necessities – our country's working people have been fully mobilized in order to achieve due achievements in this regard. Our country's working masses have never been so mobilized. They are confidently and victoriously building their beautiful life – socialism.

The immortal Lenin once said: "Only under the conditions of socialism can a movement of rapid progress in all aspects of social and personal life begin, a real practical mass movement begin, which at first includes the majority of residents, and then all residents." The victorious experience of building socialism in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries – including our country – fully confirms Lenin's brilliant ideas. All these achievements have consolidated and strengthened our people's love for our Labor Party and for the Soviet Union. The Albanian people understand and deeply recognize that the unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union is the most precious fruit and guarantee of our motherland's freedom and independence.

                  ×　×　×

Our country's working people had their own trusted leader – the Albanian Communist Party – for the first time on November 8, 1941. The Communist Party led the people through tremendous difficulties and heroic struggles to achieve victory, and today it is leading the people on the road to socialism.

All the working people of our country are closely linked to the Party and regard the Party as an unwavering fighter for the happiness of the people.

The Party's policies reflect the vital interests of the people. Because the Party has no interests other than the interests of the working people. It is precisely because of this that the people support this policy, regard it as their own policy, and wage a resolute struggle for its realization. The inexhaustible source of strength of our Party lies in its unwavering loyalty to the victorious doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The Party constantly studies the historical experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, creatively applies it to the specific conditions of Albania, and is therefore able to lead the people to achieve great victories and the victory of Marxist-Leninist thought in our country.

                ×　×　×

Our people's democratic country was born and consolidated in a sharp struggle against the imperialist reactionary forces. The imperialists have fabricated various conspiracies and tried their best to intimidate our people, vainly attempting to make them deviate from their socialist path, separate our country from the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp, restore the domestic reactionary forces, and overthrow the people's regime. But all the attempts and plans of the imperialists have failed shamefully. Our people cannot be intimidated, because our Party and government have implemented and are still implementing a firm policy of safeguarding the freedom, independence, and territorial integrity of our People's Republic, and because the Soviet Union is constantly protecting our country.

The basis of the foreign policy of our Party and government is to defend peace and constantly consolidate the friendship with the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and the peoples of all countries who are fighting for peace. Our government advocates establishing normal relations with all countries – including neighboring countries – on the basis of respecting our independence and territorial integrity. Our government promotes with all its strength the cause of easing international tensions and resolving all outstanding international issues. The government of the People's Republic of Albania and all our people fully support the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union: resolving the German question, guaranteeing collective security in Europe, reducing armaments, and banning atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction.

The Albanian people, who suffered great sacrifices in the struggle for freedom, have always loved the great Chinese people, cared about their struggles, and deeply admired their high patriotism and unwavering determination to fight for freedom and national independence. The great victory of the Chinese people is the inevitable result of the victorious Chinese people's revolution under the leadership of the heroic Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. The Albanian people heartily congratulate the great victory of the Chinese people, as they would their own great victory and the historic victory of the entire peace and socialism camp. The Albanian people understand that the establishment of the Chinese people's regime is the result of the bloodshed and sacrifice of the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people, and that the People's Republic of China is the glorious product of the Marxist-Leninist policies of the Chinese Communist Party; just as the establishment of the People's Republic of Albania is the result of the high price paid by the Albanian people and the bloodshed and sacrifice of their outstanding sons and daughters, the People's Republic of Albania is the product of the Marxist-Leninist policies of the Albanian Labor Party.

It is precisely for this reason that our people regard the victory of our revolution as our common victory, a victory achieved in the struggle against the common imperialist enemies and traitors. Whether in China or in Albania, the people have defeated their enemies. They have established their own regime and are building socialism, and now nothing can separate the peoples of our two countries. We are more closely united. No force in the world can stop the upsurge of our construction cause, because our cause is just, and the peace and socialism camp is headed by the great Soviet Union.

The Albanian people feel boundless anger at the despicable acts of US imperialism. US imperialism has occupied Taiwan, which has belonged to China since ancient times, supports the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang, and has tried its best to prevent the People's Republic of China from obtaining its legitimate status in the United Nations. The Albanian people believe that the Chinese people's great desire to liberate Taiwan and to completely liberate their motherland is an unswerving right. The friendship between our people and the Chinese people will be further consolidated. The Albanian people say: "Our border line extends all the way to great China, all the way to the border line of the world peace camp." Our people use these words to express the great strength and firm confidence in the friendship of the people of all countries in the peace and socialism camp, which has a population of 900 million. This strength is generated by and inspired by the great and profound friendship of our various people's democratic countries with the great friend – the glorious Soviet Union.

    编者按：十一月二十九日，是阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年纪念日。为庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民这个光荣的节日，本报曾约请阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席图·雅科瓦同志写了一篇纪念文章，因路途延误，收到较迟，今天才得发表。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大节日——解放十周年
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议副主席　图·雅科瓦
    一九五四年十一月二十九日，阿尔巴尼亚人民欢腾鼓舞地庆祝我国解放的第一个十周年。
    一九四四年十一月二十九日民族解放战争的胜利，是阿尔巴尼亚人民争取自由、土地和民族独立的长期努力和奋斗所获得的光荣成果。
    这个伟大的历史性胜利的取得，是由于阿尔巴尼亚共产党（现称劳动党）组织了并领导了这次争取自由和独立的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚的解放是同光荣的苏军的参战密切相联的。苏军粉碎了希特勒的战争机器，并为阿尔巴尼亚民族解放军解放自己的祖国创造了条件。
    继续了三年之久的战争，使阿尔巴尼亚人民付出了巨大的代价。意德占领者在我国人民中间犯下了滔天的罪行。他们当着母亲的面把孩子抛到火堆里。在解放祖国的战争中，阿尔巴尼亚人民付出了很大的代价：牺牲了两万八千多人，一万二千六百人受伤，被监禁和劫走的有一万人，六万一千幢房屋被焚毁，一百多万头牲畜被屠杀。法西斯占领者留下的只是一片废墟。许多地方整个地区付之一炬，交通和电信联络被切断，主要的桥梁和码头也被炸毁了；工业遭受了损失，运输工具被掠夺，全部黄金储备都被劫走，纸币购买力跌落，国库空虚，饥荒和失业现象遍及全国。
    我们的勇敢的游击队和民族解放军沿着交通线组织了伏击，袭击了城市，并在城市里同敌人——意德占领者及他们的仆从们进行血战，使敌人遭到惨败并迫使他们溃退。可是，这些卑鄙的罪犯的污血是不能抵偿他们给阿尔巴尼亚人民造成的全部损失的。
    无辜地遭受了如此巨大损失的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在这个伟大的历史性的日子里，再一次大声疾呼：反对法西斯野兽和阿尔巴尼亚的过去的统治阶级。这个统治阶级出卖了民族事业，同意德占领者勾结，并参与他们所干的一切罪行。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民十分珍视自己的胜利，并像保护眼珠一样地捍卫着这个胜利，捍卫着自己同苏联以及以苏联为首的我们伟大的和平的社会主义阵营所有各国之间的牢不可破的友谊。阿尔巴尼亚人民从来没有像今天一样有着这样真诚而强大的朋友，他们保卫着阿尔巴尼亚人民，并且在阿尔巴尼亚人民建设新生活——社会主义事业中给予慷慨的援助。
    国家的解放，在劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府面前提出了重要的任务。
    当时，劳动党的基本任务就是根据我国具体情况来领导人民。需要复兴国家，为计划经济准备条件，发展新政权的社会和经济的基础，给作为从资本主义向社会主义过渡时期的基本任务的社会主义建设准备基础——这都是迫切的任务。党根据这些任务拟定了自己的路线。劳动群众满怀着惊人的建设和创造的热情、高度的爱国主义精神和对自己事业的坚定不移的信心团结在这个路线的周围。他们在国民经济建设的事业中以加快的速度前进，充分地表现出只有社会主义建设者才具有的那些品质。在最短期间，全部被破坏的景象都已消除了，国家开始了正常的生活。
    人民民主政府通过一系列的措施，实行了各种经济和社会的根本改革。
    人民民主政府取消了外国的特权，垄断了对外贸易，把银行和交通工具收归国有，控制了工业，后来又废除了资本主义所有制并建立了社会主义经济部门；建立了国营的和合作社的商业、工艺合作社，对在战争期间发了财的大商人和企业主征收了特别税，实行了土地改革，废除了地主的土地所有制并建立了社会主义农业部门。
    土地改革的结果，七万零二百十一户少地和无地的农民得到了十七万二千六百五十九公顷的土地、四十七万四千二百二十七棵橄榄树和五千九百二十三头耕畜。土地改革的实行，永远埋葬了封建主义，是我国农民、我国全体人民的历史性胜利。
    劳动群众在我国人民的历史中第一次获得了自己的权利和民主自由。一九四六年一月十一日制宪会议宣布了阿尔巴尼亚为人民共和国并批准了宪法，这部宪法忠实而正确地反映出我国人民和整个国家的最高利益。
    在党的领导下，团结在民族解放战线中的我国人民的政治上的一致，更加巩固了。最近人民议会的选举，百分之九十九以上的选民都投票选举了民主阵线的候选人，就是很好的证明。
                    ×　×　×
    解放以来已经十年了。在这个时期里，由于劳动群众完成了党和政府所提出的任务，由于苏联共产党和苏联政府的全面和经常的帮助，以及各人民民主国家的兄弟般的帮助，我们已经获得了巨大的、多方面的成就。
    解放以后的时期，是我国人民在同被打倒了的敌人和帝国主义阴谋作斗争并为克服组织建设工作上的巨大困难而斗争的时期。虽然这是一个充满了努力和牺牲的时期，但我们是胜利地渡过了。
    一九四八年十一月八日第一次党代表大会，是阿尔巴尼亚向社会主义道路前进的决定性的转折点。第一次代表大会的任务和两年计划的完成，使我国的经济更加发展了。在一九五二年三月三十一日召开的第二次党代表大会上，我国人民采取了向前迈进的新步骤。一九五一年到一九五五年的第一个五年计划提出了把我国由一个落后的农业国家改造成为农业和工业发达的国家。
    由于我国劳动群众的忘我劳动，到一九五四年年底，工业总产量将增加为战前的十一倍多；矿物产量为五点六倍，石油产量为四点三倍，食品工业产量为七点五倍，服装和制鞋工业产量为三十三点七倍，生产建筑材料的建筑工业产量为二十九倍，电力产量为十九倍。农业也同样有了显著的进展。到五年计划结束时，播种面积将增加到一九三八年的百分之一百六十九点七。我国以前没有的技术作物，也得到了显著的发展。机器拖拉机站的建立是发展农业的重要因素。国家建立了大批的农业和畜牧业企业，而在建立农业合作社方面，则是采取稳健而坚决的步骤。
    商业和工艺合作社已成为国营经济的有力助手。
    一九五三年的商品流转额增加到战前的百分之二百八十一。
    和一九五零年相比，居民在一九五四年得到的食糖增加了百分之五十六点三，棉织品增加了百分之八十一点八，皮鞋增加了百分之一百一十一点八，粗肥皂增加了百分之七十七点八。
    一九五三年居民的收入比一九五零年增加了百分之五十六，而国家的收入则增加了百分之二十九。
    在教育和文化方面也获得了巨大的成就。解放前占居民百分之八十以上的文盲，现在几乎完全扫除了。初等教育已成为义务教育，学校网已经得到了这样普遍的发展，现在甚至在最偏僻的乡村也都设有学校。解放前，阿尔巴尼亚全国仅有六百四十三所小学，有五万二千名学生，十一所七年制学校和中等学校，六千三百名学生；而在一九五四到一九五五年这一学年内，小学数目达到二千一百四十所，学生十三万六千人，七年制学校和中等学校增加到三百四十三所，学生为四万八千三百人。人民政权在我国第一次开办了六所高等学校，今年在这些学校里学习的大学生有一千二百名，还有数百名大学生在苏联和各人民民主国家的高等学校里学习。新的人民知识分子的形成，是阿尔巴尼亚人民又一个巨大的胜利。
    文化、艺术、运动、科学和文学都在迅速地发展着。
    党和政府特别重视人民的健康，每年在保健事业上都拨付很多的款项。
    一九三八年全国总共只有八所医院，八百二十张病床，到一九五三年年底已经有四十九所医院，四千张病床；另外有九十六所产科医院和分院，八百张床位，有五所疗养院，十所结核病防治所和四百五十所诊疗所，这些都是解放前完全没有的。
    这一切都是我国人民在解放后十年间所取得的光辉的成就。这些成就现在正处在新的高涨和发展中。为了完成党和政府所制定的新任务——通过加速日用品生产来改善人民的物质生活，我国劳动人民已经充分地动员起来，以便在这方面达到应有的成就。我国劳动群众从没有过这样的动员。他们正满怀信心地、胜利地建设着自己的美好生活——社会主义。
    不朽的列宁曾经说过：“只有在社会主义的条件下，才能在社会和个人生活的一切方面开始迅速地向前进步的运动，开始一个真正的实际的群众运动，这个运动起先是包括着大多数居民，而后则包括全体居民。”苏联和各人民民主国家——包括我国在内——的胜利建设社会主义的经验，充分地证实了列宁的天才的思想。所有这些成就，巩固和加强了我国人民对我国劳动党和对苏联的热爱。阿尔巴尼亚人民懂得并且深刻地认识到，同苏联的牢不可破的友谊，是我们祖国自由和独立的最珍贵的成果和保证。
                  ×　×　×
    我国劳动人民在一九四一年十一月八日第一次有了自己信赖的领导者——阿尔巴尼亚共产党。共产党领导人民经历了巨大的困难和英勇的斗争而取得了胜利，今天正在领导人民走向社会主义道路。
    我国全体劳动人民同党密切地联系着，并把党看作为人民幸福而斗争的坚定不移的战士。
    党的政策反映着人民的切身利益。因为除了劳动人民的利益以外，党并没有其他的利益。正是因为如此，人民支持这个政策，把它看作是自己的政策，并为它的实现而进行坚决的斗争。我们党的力量的无尽源泉，在于它坚定不移地忠实于马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的胜利学说。党不断地研究苏联共产党的历史经验，把它创造性地运用于阿尔巴尼亚的具体条件，因而能够领导人民取得了巨大的胜利，取得了马克思列宁主义思想在我国的胜利。
                ×　×　×
    我们的人民民主国家是在同帝国主义反动势力进行尖锐的斗争中诞生和巩固起来的。帝国主义者制造了各种阴谋并极力恫吓我国人民，妄想使他们离开自己的社会主义道路，把我国同苏联和整个社会主义阵营分割开来，使国内反动势力复辟，推翻人民政权。但是帝国主义者的一切企图和计划都可耻地失败了。我们的人民是吓不倒的，因为我们党和政府实行了并仍在实行着保卫我们人民共和国的自由、独立和领土完整的坚定的政策，因为苏联不断地保卫着我国。
    我们党和政府的对外政策的基础是保卫和平，不断地巩固同苏联、人民民主国家以及为和平而斗争的各族人民的友谊。我国政府主张同所有国家——包括邻国在内——在尊重我国独立和领土完整的基础上建立正常的关系。我国政府以全力促进缓和国际紧张局势的事业和解决所有悬而未决的国际问题，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和我国全体人民完全拥护苏联所提出的这些建议：解决德国问题，保证欧洲集体安全，裁减军备，禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器。
    在争取自由的斗争中曾经遭受了巨大牺牲的阿尔巴尼亚人民，一向热爱伟大的中国人民，关怀他们的斗争，深切钦佩他们高度的爱国主义和争取自由和民族独立的坚定不移的决心。中国人民的伟大胜利，是在以毛泽东同志为首的英雄的中国共产党领导下的胜利的中国人民革命的必然结果。阿尔巴尼亚人民像对待自己的伟大胜利和整个和平和社会主义阵营的历史性胜利那样，衷心地祝贺中国人民的伟大胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民懂得：中国人民政权的建立是中国人民优秀儿女流血牺牲的结果，中华人民共和国是中国共产党的马克思列宁主义政策的光荣的产物；正像阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的建立是阿尔巴尼亚人民付出很高代价和他们的优秀儿女流血牺牲的结果，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的马克思列宁主义政策的产物一样。
    正是由于这个原因，我国人民把我们革命的胜利看作是我们共同的胜利，这种革命的胜利是在反对共同的帝国主义敌人和卖国贼的斗争中所取得的胜利。无论在中国或是在阿尔巴尼亚，人民都战胜了自己的敌人。他们建立了自己的政权并正在建设着社会主义，现在什么也不能分离我们两国人民。我们更加亲密地团结在一起。世界上没有任何力量能够阻止我们的建设事业的高涨，因为我们的事业是正义的，和平和社会主义阵营是以伟大的苏联为首的。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民对于美帝国主义的卑鄙行为感到无比的愤怒。美帝国主义侵占了自古以来属于中国的领土台湾，支持蒋介石卖国匪帮，竭力阻挠中华人民共和国取得在联合国中的合法地位。阿尔巴尼亚人民认为中国人民要求解放台湾，要求完全解放自己祖国的伟大愿望，是确定不移的权利。我国人民和中国人民之间的友谊将更加巩固起来。阿尔巴尼亚人民说：“我们的国境线一直延展到伟大的中国，一直延展到世界和平阵营的边界线。”我国人民用这样的话来表示对于拥有九亿人民的和平和社会主义阵营各国人民友谊的伟大力量与坚定信心。这种力量是由我们各人民民主国家同伟大的朋友——光荣的苏联的伟大而深厚的友谊所产生，并为这一友谊所鼓舞的。
