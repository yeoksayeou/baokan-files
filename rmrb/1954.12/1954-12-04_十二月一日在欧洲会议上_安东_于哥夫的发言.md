Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 2nd (TASS):

Dear Comrades!

The government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the entire Bulgarian people warmly welcome the Soviet government's initiative in convening this conference. This is entirely understandable. The conference of European countries is being held at a particularly important moment when the Paris Agreements have created a new situation. Therefore, the issue of safeguarding and consolidating peace has become even more significant. The Bulgarian people, like all other peace-loving people in the world and in Europe, are deeply concerned about the cause of maintaining peace.

The government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people have, on many occasions and through various opportunities, clearly expressed their desire for peace and peaceful cooperation among all nations, and their love and gratitude for the Soviet Union, their liberator.

The Soviet government's proposal to establish a solid system of collective security in Europe is in line with the vital interests of the people of all European countries and the interests of the people of those countries that have accepted the proposal to convene the conference and have sent their delegations. At the same time, it is also in line with the interests of the people of those countries that agree in principle with the idea of European collective security, as well as the interests of the people of those countries that have rejected this proposal and have openly embarked on the path of reviving West German militarism, the path of preparing for aggression. The fact that the idea of collective security has gained the support of millions of peace-loving people around the world and in Europe gives the Moscow conference great international significance.

The resolutions of the conference will be a new and significant step forward in the cause of consolidating peace and security for the people of Europe and the world, and at the same time, a warning to those warmongers in the West: peace-loving people of all countries will answer all attempts at aggression with greater unity in the cause of defending peace and the security of their countries.

From the very first days of its founding, the Soviet Union has advocated peace and mutual understanding among all nations. The Soviet government has consistently pursued a policy of resolving international disputes through peaceful means. The Soviet Union's tireless efforts in blocking fascism and ensuring the common security of all nations during the two world wars are well known. Consistently following this peace-loving policy, the Soviet government has repeatedly put forward concrete proposals for establishing a European security system and a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany since the Second World War. At the present conference, Comrade Molotov, the head of the Soviet delegation, clearly stated the Soviet government's attitude towards the issue of peace and collective security for the people of Europe.

This policy of the Soviet Union has gained the understanding and support of many other countries. Thanks to the struggle of freedom-loving people for peace, there has been a certain degree of relaxation in the international situation, and people from all walks of life around the world have breathed a sigh of relief.

At the same time, the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Indochina Armistice Agreement, and other agreements have strengthened this confidence: as long as there is goodwill, international disputes can be resolved through direct negotiations. The Soviet Union's peace-loving policy has pointed out to all nations the only path to consolidating peace, mutual understanding, and cooperation between countries, which is based on peaceful competition and coexistence between countries with different social systems.

However, this is very unpalatable to the leaders of the United States, Britain, and France. The Western aggressive bloc, especially the United States, has used its "strength" policy to counter the Soviet Union's peace-loving policy and has used every means to prevent the peaceful resolution of international disputes and to intensify international tension.

Only this can explain why the United States, Britain, and France have refused to participate in the conference and why they have pressured other Western countries to not participate in the current conference.

The ruling circles of the United States and its European puppets, in order to use West German militarism as a tool to realize their aggressive plans, are attempting to revive West German militarism at any cost, regardless of the vital interests and the will of the people of all countries.

There is no doubt that the path taken by certain Western countries headed by the United States, the path of the Paris Agreements, is to establish secret military blocs, to militarize West Germany, to threaten the security of European countries neighboring Germany, and to create a direct danger of causing a new war. This is an adventurous path that is severely condemned by peace-loving people.

After the failure of the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty – a treaty that has been the basis of American policy toward Europe for several years, the purpose of which is to rearm West Germany and drag it into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc – now, the ruling circles in Washington, London, Paris, and Bonn are trying to achieve the same goal through the London and Paris Agreements.

The fact that these agreements stipulate that a huge army armed with the latest weapons, including atomic weapons, will be established in West Germany in just two years proves how dangerous these agreements are to all nations and how much they violate the fundamental interests of all nations. Once this army is established, it will become a real and direct threat to peace in Europe, a threat that will be even more serious than on the eve of the Second World War.

Ratifying the Paris Agreements will lead to a sharp deterioration in relations between European countries, make the peaceful unification of Germany impossible for a long time, and deepen the danger of a new war. In this way, it will inevitably strengthen the arms race, and new heavy burdens will fall on the shoulders of the people of all countries. Therefore, the Paris Agreements, in essence, lay the foundation for a constant source of hostility and conflict between European countries.

In this situation, it is entirely understandable why the people of Europe are worried about the re-militarization of West Germany in the agreements signed in Paris. The painful experience of the recent past has proven that dividing Europe into two blocs and freeing the hands of German militarists often leads the people of European countries to massive bloodshed and countless sacrifices. Is it not very clear that the majority of Europeans have firmly expressed their opposition to the Paris Agreements? The memory of the German militarists' predatory policies and the suffering of the people of all countries, including the Bulgarian people, is still fresh, and the people of all countries cannot tolerate various conspiracies to revive German militarism.

In less than thirty years, German militarists have twice invaded the Balkans, and their aggression has caused immense sacrifices and enormous destruction to the people of Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Albania, and Greece. The Bulgarian people and the people of other Balkan countries will never forget this. They cannot sit idly by while the leaders of the United States, Britain, and France hand over weapons to German revanchists who are openly declaring their territorial ambitions and talking about "natural" spheres of influence again. At this time, any indifferent attitude is tantamount to compromising with new war preparations.

As everyone knows, German imperialists have always regarded the Balkan countries as their sphere of influence in their policy of aggression in Southeast Europe. Under the support of the traitorous Bulgarian royal fascist group, the rule of German monopoly capital in Bulgaria brought countless disasters to the Bulgarian people, plunged them into the abyss of national disaster twice, and faced them with a third disaster, only thanks to the heroic victory of the Soviet army, did they escape the calamity. Our people, with the help of the Soviet army, completed the people's revolution on September 9, 1944.

At present, when the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France are once again making it possible for West German revanchist forces to prepare for a new war, the Bulgarian people feel that their security is seriously threatened, and they are prepared to contribute their strength, together with the peace-loving people of other European countries, to prevent the barbarous German militarists from plunging the world into a new, more terrible war for the third time. Was not the Bulgarian people's heroic struggle against the fascist system and German occupation for twenty years, the two popular uprisings launched for freedom and national independence, and the sacrifice of more than 100,000 sons and daughters of the motherland for this purpose?

The Bulgarian people, who have groaned under foreign oppression for five centuries, and then lived and struggled for more than twenty years in a bloody fascist dictatorship, when they have already tasted freedom, then no new ambitious world rulers can lead such a nation away from the correct path – the friendly path of the peace-loving people headed by the Soviet Union. Our people regard the fraternal and unbreakable friendship with the Soviet Union and the closest cooperation with the people's democratic countries as the guarantee of their freedom and independence, and draw strength and inspiration from building their new happy life.

Our treaties with the Soviet Union and the European people's democratic countries on friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance are the most obvious manifestation of a policy of friendship and cooperation. In contrast to the Western aggressive treaties and military blocs, the treaties concluded by the Soviet Union with the people's democratic countries on friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation are aimed at opposing the revival of German militarism and defending European security. These treaties are fundamentally different from the treaties of Western countries.

This peace-loving policy of our government has also achieved good results in improving relations with neighboring Balkan countries. Diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia have been normalized, the trade exchange between the two countries has been restored, and the foundation for more extensive economic and cultural cooperation has been laid. The People's Republic of Bulgaria has restored diplomatic relations with Greece, and conditions are being created for more active trade exchange between the two countries.

The government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria is now and will continue to be committed to further improving relations with the Balkan countries.

Proceeding from the interests of our people, and from the desire to consolidate peace and peaceful cooperation between countries – regardless of their social and economic systems – our government has achieved great success in expanding business ties with other European countries on the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect.

The government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the people of Bulgaria are concentrating all their efforts on striving for the victory of the policy of peace and the cooperation of the people of Europe. The Bulgarian government believes that the main task of its foreign policy is to help ease international tensions, to promote the resolution of outstanding issues between the countries concerned through peaceful negotiations, and to help consolidate peace and the security of the people of Europe.

The government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria firmly supports the Soviet government's proposal to sign a "Pan-European Treaty on Guaranteeing European Collective Security," and our government believes that this treaty is an effective guarantee against possible aggression and a guarantee for defending peace. Our government is deeply convinced that the implementation of this proposal will prevent the revival of German militarism and greatly promote the unification of Germany on a peace-loving and democratic basis.

The Bulgarian government would like to especially emphasize that the Soviet Union's proposal can guarantee the independence and sovereignty of large and small countries participating in the European collective security system.

Our delegation believes that when the Paris Agreements have not yet been ratified, the road to peace and peaceful cooperation, the road to establishing a European collective security system, is still open to the people of Europe, and this can prevent Europe from being divided into two opposing military blocs.

Our delegation agrees with what the Soviet Union and other delegations that have spoken at the meeting have said about the serious danger to European peace threatened by the Paris Agreements. Therefore, our delegation declares that we support all measures aimed at defending peace and the peaceful cooperation of the people of all countries, and at achieving collective security.

Our delegation fully agrees that when the aggressive groups of the West, especially the leading figures of the US government, are still continuing to divide Europe, establish military blocs, and militarize West Germany, using this to oppose the Soviet Union and other European countries, then the freedom-loving people of all countries have every right to discuss and adopt all necessary common measures to defend their freedom and territorial integrity, including all necessary military measures. At the same time, the aggressive ruling groups of Western countries, especially the ruling groups of the United States, should bear full responsibility for the situation and consequences caused by the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

Our delegation firmly states that in order to consolidate peace in Europe and for the happiness of our people, the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria will make greater efforts in the cause of uniting all the forces of the strong peace-loving front headed by the great Soviet Union. Our joint efforts will surely solve this great and noble task. Because the desire of our people and all peace-loving people in the world is so ardent, and our will is so firm.

### 十二月一日在欧洲会议上  安东·于哥夫的发言

    十二月一日在欧洲会议上
    安东·于哥夫的发言敬爱的同志们！
    保加利亚人民共和国政府和全体保加利亚人民热烈欢迎苏联政府发起召开这次会议。这是完全可以理解的。欧洲各国人民的会议是在巴黎协定造成新的情况这一特别重要时刻召开的。因此，关于保卫和巩固和平的问题就具有更重大的意义。保加利亚人民，也像全世界和欧洲所有其他爱好和平的人民一样，深切地关心着维护和平的事业。
    保加利亚人民共和国政府和保加利亚人民，利用各种机会，屡次明确地表示了他们对和平和各国人民间和平合作的意愿，对苏联，自己的解放者的热爱和感激。
    苏联政府关于建立巩固的欧洲集体安全体系的建议，是符合于欧洲各国人民的切身利益和那些接受召开会议的建议并派出了他们的代表团的那些国家的人民的利益的，同时也是符合于那些在原则上同意欧洲集体安全思想的那些国家的人民的利益，以及那些拒绝了这个建议的国家的人民的利益的，这些国家已公开地走上复活西德军国主义的道路，走上准备侵略的道路。集体安全的思想已获得全世界和欧洲千百万爱好和平的人民的支持这一事实，使莫斯科会议具有重大的国际意义。
    会议的决议，将是在巩固欧洲和全世界各国人民和平和安全的事业中迈进的新的重大的一步，同时也是对西方的那些热中于战争的人们下的警告：爱好和平的各国人民将在保卫和平和自己国家安全的事业中更加团结一致地来回答各种侵略企图。
    苏联从建国的最初日子起，就主张和平和所有各民族之间的互相了解。苏联政府始终不渝地执行着用和平方法解决国际纷争的政策。苏联在两次世界大战期间在堵塞法西斯主义和保证各国人民的共同安全方面的不倦的努力是人所共知的。一贯遵循着这种爱和平政策的苏联政府，在第二次世界大战以后屡次提出关于建立欧洲安全体系，建立统一的、爱好和平的、民主的德国的具体的建议。在现在的会议上，苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫同志明确地表明了苏联政府对欧洲各国人民和平和集体安全的问题的态度。
    苏联的这种政策，获得了其他许多国家的谅解和支持，由于爱自由的各国人民争取和平的斗争，在国际局势中开始有了一定程度的缓和，世界广大的各界人士都轻松地吐了一口气。
    同时，朝鲜停战协定、印度支那停战协定以及其他协定，都加强了这种信心：只要有善良的意图，国际间的纠纷，是能够用直接谈判的方法来解决的。苏联的爱和平的政策给各国人民指出了巩固和平、各国之间互相谅解和合作的唯一的道路，这条道路的基础就是不同社会制度的国家之间的和平竞赛和共处。
    但是，这是非常不合乎美国、英国和法国的领导人物们的口胃的。西方的侵略集团，首先是美国，使自己的“实力”政策来同苏联的爱好和平的政策相对立，并用尽各种方法来阻止和平解决国际纠纷和加强国际紧张局势。
    只有这件事才可以说明美国、英国和法国拒绝参加会议和它们压迫其他西方国家使这些国家不参加现在的会议。
    美国统治集团和它的欧洲的傀儡，为了把西德军国主义作为实现他们的侵略计划的工具，不顾各国人民的切身利益和他们的意志，企图不惜任何代价来恢复西德军国主义。
    毫无疑问，以美国为首的某些西方国家所走的道路，巴黎协定的道路，就是要建立秘密的军事集团，使西德军国主义化，威胁同德国为邻的欧洲各国的安全和制造引起新战争的直接危险。这是一条为爱好和平的人民所严厉斥责的冒险道路。
    在所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约——这个条约几年来一直是美国对欧洲政策的基础，其目的是重新武装西德并把西德拉入北大西洋侵略集团——失败以后，现在，无论是华盛顿或是伦敦、巴黎和波恩的统治集团，都力图通过伦敦和巴黎协定来达到这同样的目的。
    这些协定预定仅仅在两年的时间内，就要在西德建立一支用最新式的武器包括原子武器武装起来的庞大军队，这件事实就证明了这些协定对于各国人民是多么危险，它们是多么违反各国人民的根本利益。这种军队一经建立，即将成为对欧洲和平的真正的直接威胁，这种威胁将比第二次世界大战前夜更为严重。
    批准巴黎协定，就会引起欧洲各国之间相互关系的尖锐化，使德国的和平统一长期成为不可能，并加深新战争的危险。这样一来，势必要加强军备竞赛，新的沉重的负担将落到各国人民的肩上。因此，巴黎协定，按其本质说来，为欧洲各国之间仇视和冲突的经常的策源地打下基础。
    在这种情况下，欧洲人民为什么会对在巴黎签订的协定中关于西德重新军国主义化一事表示忧虑，就是完全可以理解的了。不久以前的痛苦经验证明，把欧洲分裂为两个集团并解开德国军国主义分子的双手，常常把欧洲各国人民引向大量的流血和无数的牺牲。大多数欧洲人都坚决表示反对巴黎协定，难道这还不很明白吗？对德国军国主义的掠夺政策，对各国人民包括保加利亚人民所遭受的苦难，现在记忆犹新，各国人民是不能容忍复活德国军国主义的各种阴谋的。
    在不到三十年时间中，德国军国主义分子就曾两次侵犯巴尔干，他们的侵略使保加利亚、南斯拉夫、阿尔巴尼亚和希腊等国的人民，遭受了莫大的牺牲和巨大的破坏。保加利亚人民和巴尔干其他国家人民永不会忘记这些。他们不能坐视美、英、法三国的领导者把武器重新交给德国复仇主义者，这些复仇主义者正公开宣布他们的领土野心，并重新谈论“天然”势力范围。在这种时候任何漠不关心的态度，就等于是向新的战争准备妥协。
    大家知道，德国帝国主义者在他们侵略东南欧的政策中，总是把巴尔干各国看做是他们的势力范围。在卖国的保加利亚保皇法西斯集团支持下，德国垄断资本在保加利亚的统治，给保加利亚人民带来无数的灾难，把他们两度抛入民族灾祸的深渊，并使他们面临第三次灾祸，只是由于苏军的英勇胜利，才使他们得免于难，我国人民依靠苏军的帮助在一九四四年九月九日，完成了人民革命。
    目前，当美、英、法三国统治集团重新使西德复仇主义势力有可能准备新战争的时候，保加利亚人民感到他们的安全受到严重威胁，他们准备同欧洲其他国家爱好和平的人民共同为阻止野蛮的德国军国主义者第三次把世界抛入新的、更可怖的战争，贡献出自己的力量。我国人民二十年来为反对法西斯制度和德国的占领所进行的英勇斗争，为争取自由和民族独立而发动的两次人民起义，和因此而牺牲的十万以上的祖国儿女，不就是为了这一目的吗？
    曾在外国压迫下呻吟达五世纪之久，其后又在血腥的法西斯独裁环境下生活和斗争二十多年的保加利亚人民，当他们已经尝到自由的时候，那么任何新的妄图统治世界的野心家都不能使这样的民族离开那条正确的道路——以苏联为首的爱好和平的人民的友好道路。我国人民把同苏联的兄弟般的、牢不可破的友谊，同各人民民主国家最密切的合作，看作是自己的自由和独立的保障，并从建立自己的新的幸福的快乐生活中，取得力量和鼓舞。
  我国同苏联及欧洲各人民民主国家签订的关于友好、合作和互助的条约，是友好和合作政策的最明显的表现。和西方的侵略条约、军事集团相反，苏联同各人民民主国家所缔结的关于友好互助和合作的条约，是以反对复活德国军国主义，保卫欧洲安全为目的的。这些条约同西方国家的条约有着本质上的区别。
    我国政府的这个爱好和平的政策在改善同毗邻的巴尔干各国的关系上也收到了良好的效果。同南斯拉夫的外交关系已正常化，两国的商品交换关系已经恢复，并已奠定了更加广泛的经济和文化合作的基础。保加利亚人民共和国已和希腊恢复了外交关系，两国更加积极地进行商品交换的条件正在建立中。
    保加利亚人民共和国的政府无论现在和将来都在致力于进一步改善同巴尔干各国的关系。
    我国政府从我国人民的利益出发，从巩固和平和各国间——不论它们的社会、经济制度如何——的和平合作的愿望出发，已经在同其他欧洲国家在互利和互相尊重的基础上扩大事务联系方面，获得了巨大成绩。
    保加利亚人民共和国政府和保加利亚的人民集中全力为和平政策的胜利和欧洲各国人民的合作而奋斗。保加利亚政府认为自己的外交政策的主要任务是帮助缓和国际紧张局势，促使有关国家间悬而未决的问题能通过和谈方式解决，并帮助巩固和平和欧洲各国人民的安全。
    保加利亚人民共和国政府坚决拥护苏联政府关于签订“保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约”的建议，我国政府认为这个条约是防止可能发生的侵略的有效保障，是保卫和平的保障。我国政府深信，实现这个建议就能制止德国军国主义复活和大大促进德国在爱好和平和民主的基础上的统一。
    保加利亚政府愿意特别着重指出，苏联的建议能保证维护参加欧洲集体安全体系的大国和小国的独立和主权。
    我国代表团认为，当巴黎协定尚未被批准的时候，走向和平与和平合作、走向建立欧洲集体安全体系的道路对欧洲各国人民还是敞开着的，这样就可防止把欧洲分裂为两个相互对立的军事集团。
    我国代表团同意苏联和其他在会上发言的代表团所谈到的关于巴黎协定签订以后威胁着欧洲和平的严重危险，因此，我国代表团声明，我们拥护一切旨在保卫和平和各国人民的和平合作、旨在实现集体安全的各项措施。
    我国代表团完全同意，在西方的侵略集团，首先是美国政府的领导人物，仍然在继续分裂欧洲、建立军事集团和使西德军国主义化并以此来反对苏联及欧洲其它各国人民时，那么爱好自由的各国人民为保卫自己的自由和领土完整，完全有权讨论并通过一切必要的共同措施，其中也包括一切必要的军事措施。同时，由于批准巴黎协定所造成的局势和后果，应当由西方各国的侵略统治集团、首先是美国的统治集团负全部责任。
    我国代表团坚决表示，为了巩固欧洲和平，为了我们各国人民的幸福，在团结以伟大苏联为首的强大爱好和平阵线的一切力量的事业中，保加利亚人民共和国政府将做出更大的努力。我们共同的努力，一定可以解决这个伟大而崇高的任务。因为我们各国人民和世界上一切爱好和平的人民的愿望是这样炽烈，我们的意志是这样坚定。
