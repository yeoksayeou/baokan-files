    The Democratic Nature of the Soviet Constitution
    By A. Sheshkov of the Soviet Union
    On December 5th, the Soviet Union will solemnly celebrate Constitution Day. It is a grand and joyous festival in the lives of the Soviet people.
    The Soviet Constitution was adopted eighteen years ago, on December 5, 1936, by the Extraordinary Eighth All-Union Congress of Soviets. It is a document of historical significance, which in concise language, almost in a record-keeping style, narrates the fact that the laboring people of one-sixth of the earth have been freed from capitalist enslavement, the fact that socialism has triumphed in the Soviet Union, and the fact that a broad and most thorough democracy has triumphed in the Soviet Union.
    There have been, and still are, many constitutions in the world. However, the Soviet Constitution is the first of its kind to embody what the best minds of humanity have dreamed of. The characteristic of the Soviet Constitution lies first and foremost in the fact that it takes as its starting point the fact that the capitalist system has been eliminated and that socialism has been victorious in the Soviet Union. The main basis of the Soviet Constitution is the socialist principle, the basic pillars of socialism that have been won and achieved: socialist ownership of the means of production; the elimination of exploitation and the exploiting classes; the elimination of the poverty of the majority and the extravagant waste of the minority; the elimination of unemployment; the right of every citizen to work; the right to rest; the right to education; and the right to material security in old age, sickness, or loss of working capacity.
    As stated in the Soviet Constitution, the economic foundation of the USSR is the socialist economic system and socialist ownership in the instruments and means of production. The land, its mineral wealth, waters, forests, factories, mills, mines, rail transport, water transport, banks, means of communication, large-scale state-organized agricultural enterprises (state farms, machine and tractor stations, etc.), as well as municipal enterprises and the bulk of the dwelling houses in the cities and industrial localities, are state property, that is, belong to the whole people.
    In addition to state property, there is also cooperative and collective farm property in the Soviet Union. The common enterprises of collective farms and cooperatives, with their livestock and implements, the collective farm buildings, and the produce of the collective farms and cooperative organizations, constitute the cooperative collective farm property. The difference between cooperative collective farm property and state property is that the former is not the property of the whole people, but the property of individual collective farms and cooperatives, and is at their disposal. The common characteristic of state property and cooperative collective farm property is that both are socialist forms of ownership without exploitation of man by man and both are based on the collective labor of equal citizens—builders of communism.
    The Soviet Constitution, for the first time in the world, has established a social order favorable to the laboring people and to all creators of material and spiritual wealth. Its starting point is that there are no longer any antagonistic classes in Soviet society; this society is composed of two mutually friendly classes, namely, workers and peasants; and it is these two laboring classes that hold power.
    Article 1 of the Constitution states: "The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a socialist state of workers and peasants." All power in the USSR belongs to the working people of town and country as represented by the Soviets of Working People's Deputies. The deputies are elected by the voters on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage by secret ballot. The Soviets of Working People's Deputies constitute the political foundation of the USSR, its great power and invincible strength.
    An outstanding feature of the Soviet Constitution is its profound internationalist character. As stipulated in the Constitution, Soviet citizens, irrespective of nationality or race, have equal rights in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social, and political life, which is an immutable law. The inspiring words written in the Soviet national anthem: "Glory to thee, our free fatherland, reliable bulwark of the friendship of peoples!" are of great significance. From these words, one can see the happy and joyful life of the peoples of the multi-ethnic socialist country, united in unbreakable, flesh-and-blood friendship.
    Thorough and firm democracy permeates the entire Soviet Constitution. The Soviet Constitution does not recognize differences in rights between men and women, between "long-term residents" and "temporary residents," between property owners and non-property owners, between the educated and the uneducated. It does not recognize conditions, nor does it distinguish between active and passive citizens. Every Soviet citizen who has reached the age of eighteen, irrespective of race or nationality, sex or religion, education, length of residence, social origin, property status, or past activities, has the right to participate in the election of deputies to the Soviets, with the exception of persons who have been certified insane or deprived of electoral rights by a court judgment.
    The democracy of the Soviet Constitution is a special type of democracy, a socialist democracy. This democracy lies in the fact that the Soviet Constitution does not simply stipulate the rights of citizens, but also guarantees the realization of these rights. For example, the guarantee of the right to work for every Soviet citizen is the socialist organization of the national economy, the steady growth of the productive forces of Soviet society, the elimination the possibility of economic crises, and the abolition of unemployment. The guarantee of the right to rest for Soviet citizens is the establishment of an eight-hour working day for workers and office employees, the granting of annual vacations with full pay, and the provision of a wide network of sanatoriums, rest homes, and clubs for the use of the working people.
    The guarantee of the realization of political freedoms such as freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of street processions, and demonstrations is the fact that printing presses, paper, public places, means of transport, and all other material conditions are placed at the disposal of the working people and their organizations.
    According to the Soviet Constitution, Soviet citizens have the right to unite in various social organizations such as trade unions, cooperatives, youth organizations, sports and defense organizations, cultural, technical and scientific societies. The most active and conscious citizens from the working class and other working strata are united in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the leading and guiding force of socialist society. The Soviet people unanimously support the Party's policy and have complete trust in it.
    The Soviet Constitution, as the embodiment of mankind's brightest hopes, which shone upon the world eighteen years ago, has consistently inspired the Soviet people during these years. Under the banner of the Constitution, the Soviet people defended the glory, freedom, and independence of their motherland in the harsh years of the Great Patriotic War. Under the banner of the Constitution, the Soviet people have achieved new and greater victories in the period of post-war peaceful and constructive labor. Socialist industry and agriculture are developing rapidly, and the material welfare and cultural level of the Soviet people are constantly improving.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan is projected to increase industrial output by about 70 percent in five years. The completion of the Five-Year Plan tasks shows that in four years (1951-1954), Soviet industrial output will increase by 63 percent compared with 1950. This shows that the industrial Five-Year Plan will be completed ahead of schedule.
    The state procurement and purchase plans for grain have been completed ahead of schedule by collective farms and state farms across the country.
    Now, the Soviet Union has launched a struggle to drastically increase the production of daily necessities and further vigorously develop agriculture, with the aim of improving the people's lives and more fully meeting their growing material and cultural needs. The welfare and prosperity of the people are the highest criteria of the Communist Party and the Soviet government.
    The working people of the socialist country regard the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government as the expression of their own vital interests. As a result, their creative initiative is so great and their achievements in economic and cultural construction are so outstanding. The socialist democracy guaranteed by the Constitution opens up unlimited prospects for the all-round development of people's personalities and for the rapid increase of the masses' activity in all aspects of national life.
    The Soviet people see their socialist motherland as a huge lighthouse standing in the world, illuminating mankind's path toward a bright future, and therefore feel legitimate patriotic pride. The Soviet Union's unremitting struggle to uphold and consolidate peace and for the friendly cooperation of all peoples is receiving the warm support and sympathy of progressive forces in all countries of the world. The Soviet Constitution inspires the millions upon millions of honest people around the world who are engaged in the noble struggle for peace, democracy, and progress.

    苏联宪法的民主主义
    苏联　阿·舍什柯夫
    十二月五日，苏联将隆重地庆祝宪法节。它是苏联人民生活中一个盛大而愉快的节日。
    苏联宪法是在十八年前，即在一九三六年十二月五日由非常第八次全苏苏维埃代表大会通过的。它是一个有历史意义的文献，它用很简洁的语句，几乎是用记录式的体裁论述了地球上六分之一的劳动人民摆脱资本主义奴役的事实，论述社会主义在苏联胜利的事实，论述广泛的最彻底的民主制在苏联胜利的事实。
    世界上有过而且现在还有不少宪法。然而苏联宪法则是破天荒第一次把人类最美好的智慧所梦想的东西体现了出来。苏联宪法的特点，首先就在于它是以资本主义制度已被消灭和社会主义在苏联已获得胜利的事实为出发点的。构成苏联宪法主要基础的是社会主义底原则，是已争得和已实现的社会主义基本柱石：生产工具和生产资料的社会主义所有制；剥削制和剥削阶级的消灭；大多数人贫困和少数人奢侈挥霍现象的消灭；失业现象的消灭；每个公民有劳动权；休息权；受教育权；年老以及患病或丧失劳动能力时，有享受物质保证权。
    就像在苏联宪法中所指出的，苏联的经济基础是社会主义经济体系和生产工具与生产资料的社会主义所有制。土地及其蕴藏、水流、森林、工厂、矿井、矿山、铁路运输、水上运输、银行、交通工具、国营大规模农业企业（国营农场、机器拖拉机站等）、以及城市中的公用企业和主要住房都是国家财产，换句话说，所有这些都完全属于全体人民也就是全民的财产。
    除国家财产之外，在苏联还有合作社和集体农庄的财产。集体农庄和合作社的公共企业及其耕畜和工具，集体农庄的公共建筑物以及集体农庄和合作社组织所出产的产品均为合作社集体农庄财产，合作社集体农庄财产与国家财产不同之点，就在于它不是全民财产，而是个别的集体农庄和合作社的财产，并且是由它们自己来支配的。国家财产和合作社集体农庄财产的共同特点就在于这两者都是没有人剥削人的社会主义所有制的形式，两者都是以平等权利的公民——共产主义建设者的集体劳动为基础的。
    苏联宪法在世界上第一次把对于劳动人民，对于一切物质财富和精神财富的创造者有利的社会秩序固定了下来。它所持的出发点是：在苏维埃社会中已经没有了彼此对抗的阶级；这个社会是由两个互相友爱的阶级，即工人和农民所组成；执掌政权的正是这两个劳动阶级。
    宪法第一条这样规定：“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟为工农社会主义国家。”苏联全部政权属于城乡劳动者，由选民按普遍平等直接选举制，用秘密投票法所选出的劳动者代表苏维埃来实现它。劳动者代表苏维埃是苏联的政治基础，是它的伟大的威力和不可克服的力量。
    苏联宪法的卓越特点，是它具有深刻的国际主义性质。就像宪法中所规定的，苏联公民，不分民族及种族，在经济生活、国家生活、文化生活、社会及政治生活各方面，一律平等，是确定不变的法律。苏联国歌中所写的这些鼓舞人心的辞句：“光荣啊，我们的自由的祖国，各民族人民友爱的可靠的堡垒！”是意义重大的。从这些词句里，可以看出结成了骨肉般不可摧毁的友谊的多民族社会主义国家的各族人民的幸福而愉快的生活。
    彻底坚定的民主主义，显著地贯穿在全部苏联宪法之中。苏联宪法不承认在男女之间，“久居者”与“暂居者”、有产者与无产者、受过教育者与未受教育者之间有权利上的差别。它不承认附带条件，不分什么积极公民和消极公民。凡年满十八岁的苏联公民，不分种族及民族，不分性别及信仰，不分教育程度，不问居住期限，不问社会出身、财产状况以及过去活动如何，都有权参加选举苏维埃的代表，惟患精神病及由法院判决褫夺选举权者除外。
    苏联宪法的民主主义是特种类型的民主主义，社会主义的民主主义。这种民主主义在于，苏联宪法不是简单地规定公民底权利，而且保障这些权利的实现。例如，每个苏联公民的劳动权的保证是：国民经济的社会主义组织、苏维埃社会生产力的不断增长、经济危机可能性的铲除和失业现象的消灭。苏联公民休息权的保证是：规定工人和职员八小时的工作日，每年有保留原薪的休假，广泛设立的疗养院、休养所、俱乐部供劳动者享用。
    对实现言论、出版、集会、游行及示威等各项政治自由的保证是：印刷所、纸张、公共场所、交通工具以及其他一切物质条件，均供劳动者及其组织享用。
    根据苏联宪法规定，苏联公民有权结合于各种社会团体，如职工会、合作社、青年团体、体育及国防组织、文化、技术及科学团体。而工人阶级及其他劳动阶层中最积极最觉悟的公民，则结合于社会主义社会的领导和指导力量——苏联共产党之中。苏联人民一致拥护党底政策，并对它完全信任。
    作为人类最光辉的希望的体现、在十八年前就照耀在全世界上的苏联宪法，在这些年月里始终鼓舞着苏联人民。在宪法的旗帜下，苏联人民在伟大卫国战争的严酷年月里保卫住了自己祖国的光荣、自由和独立。在宪法的旗帜下，苏联人民在战后和平建设性劳动的时期获得了新而又新的胜利。社会主义工业和农业在一往直前地发展，苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平也在不断的提高。
    第五个五年计划预定在五年内把工业产量增加百分之七十左右。五年计划任务的完成情况表明，在四年内（一九五一—一九五四年），苏联工业产量比一九五零年将增加百分之六十三。这说明，工业的五年计划将提前完成。
    国家采购和征购粮食的计划已由全国各集体农庄和国营农场提前完成了。
    现在，苏联已展开了为急剧增加日用品生产和进一步大力发展农业的斗争，其目的是为了改善人民的生活，更充分地满足他们日益增长的物质和文化的需要。人民的福利和繁荣乃是共产党和苏联政府的最高准则。
    社会主义国家的劳动人民把共产党和苏联政府的政策看做是自己切身利益的表现，因此，他们的创造积极性是这样巨大，他们在经济和文化建设方面的成就是这样卓越。由宪法所保证的社会主义民主为全面发展人们的个性，为急剧提高群众在国家生活各方面的积极性开辟着无限远景。
    苏联人民看到他们的社会主义祖国是屹立在世界上的照亮着人类走向光明未来的一座巨大灯塔，因而感到合法的爱国主义的自豪。苏联为维护和巩固和平，为各族人民的友好合作的不懈斗争，正得到世界各国进步力量的热烈支持和同情。苏维埃宪法鼓舞着为争取和平、民主和进步而进行崇高斗争的全世界千千万万的正直的人们。
