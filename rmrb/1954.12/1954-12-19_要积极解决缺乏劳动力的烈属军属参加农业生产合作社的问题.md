Answering Readers' Questions

    It is necessary to actively solve the problem of revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents lacking labor power to participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives.
    A few days ago, the editorial department received a letter from reader Zhang Changwei, inquiring about the township's agricultural producers' cooperative's refusal to accept his family members into the cooperative. He said:
    I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, now guarding the motherland's coastline. I am an only child, and there are only my sixty-year-old mother and a younger sister who is studying at home. In 1951, the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea aroused my patriotism and internationalism, and I volunteered to join the army to fight on the Korean front. This year, after studying the general line, I understood the backwardness and conservatism of the small-peasant economy, which hinders the improvement of agricultural production. To get rid of poverty and live a prosperous life, farmers must take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation and actively complete the socialist transformation of agriculture. Therefore, I wrote several letters in a row mobilizing my family to participate in mutual aid groups and agricultural producers' cooperatives. But the letter from home told me: "...because my family has no labor power, no one wants us to join the mutual aid group." Comrade Editor! I don't understand why the organizers and leading cadres of the agricultural producers' cooperative refuse my family to join the cooperative?
    Regarding the issue of revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents lacking labor power to participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives, they should be absorbed into the cooperative as much as possible, based on the specific circumstances of the local cooperative and under the principle of giving priority to preferential treatment. The specific circumstances mentioned here include: 1. Whether the labor power and land within the cooperative are adapted to each other, and whether there is sufficient strength to cultivate the land after people lacking labor power bring land into the cooperative; 2. What is the size of the cooperative's foundation? Larger cooperatives can take better care of them, while smaller cooperatives have difficulty doing so; 3. Whether the cooperative's leadership has experience in organizing labor power. If they have experience, they can fully utilize the effectiveness of labor power and appropriately arrange for people lacking labor power to do light chores; otherwise, the opposite is true; 4. What is the level of political consciousness of the cooperative members? If the majority of cooperative members are willing to absorb people lacking labor power into the cooperative, it is naturally easy to handle; otherwise, education must be strengthened to wait for them to become more aware.
    At present, there are still some revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents lacking labor power who have not been accepted into the cooperative. These revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents have difficulties in production and life and should be assisted through mutual aid groups and agricultural producers' cooperatives. Absorbing them into the cooperative does not mean that the cooperative has to bear all the preferential treatment tasks. Because after revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents join the cooperative, they can actively participate in the cooperative's collective labor that suits their physical strength and skills. For example: if they cannot do heavy work, they can do light work; if they cannot do field work, they can do other chores (feeding livestock, taking care of children...); and they can obtain reasonable remuneration based on their "workdays." Revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents lacking labor power generally have substitute labor, which can replace the cooperative's workdays, and a very small number of people who are completely incapable of working can also bring work tickets into the cooperative as labor power. As for the handling of the substitute labor tickets that revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents should receive, it is better to return them to the cooperative to replace labor power for dividends, that is, if the work ticket has several units of labor, the revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents can receive remuneration according to several workdays. The income from substitute labor goes to the cooperative, which is in line with the principles of collective labor and remuneration according to labor. Moreover, the remuneration for the cooperative's workdays is generally higher than the price of substitute labor, which is also beneficial to revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents. Currently, there is also a phenomenon where the work tickets are given to the revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents themselves. This is because the cooperative is not well-run, and the price of substitute labor is greater than the remuneration for the cooperative's workdays, so the revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents are unwilling to record workdays and prefer to receive substitute labor remuneration. This situation should be changed by improving the cooperative's operation and management in various localities.
    As for the fact that some places have not yet absorbed revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents lacking labor power into the cooperative, the main reasons are: the foundation for the development of the cooperative movement varies from place to place. Cooperatives with a good foundation naturally have the strength to actively take care of revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents; while cooperatives with a poor foundation, in order to first achieve the consolidation of the cooperative itself, have temporarily not absorbed households lacking labor power into the cooperative. Secondly, some cooperative cadres and members have incorrect ideas. They only welcome households with strong people and horses into the cooperative and do not welcome households lacking labor power or lacking carts and horses, and even exclude them. The former situation needs to be gradually resolved as the cooperative's work is strengthened, and the latter situation must be corrected.
    In short, when dealing with the specific issue of revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents lacking labor power requesting to join the cooperative, agricultural producers' cooperatives should base themselves on specific conditions and the principle of giving priority to preferential treatment. It is certainly wrong to be able to absorb but not absorb, and to exclude the requests of revolutionary martyrs’ families and military dependents lacking labor power to join the cooperative.

### 要积极解决缺乏劳动力的烈属军属参加农业生产合作社的问题

    要积极解决缺乏劳动力的烈属军属参加农业生产合作社的问题
    前几天，编辑部接到了读者章长威来信，对乡里的农业生产合作社不接收他的家属加入合作社的要求，提出询问。他说：
    我是解放军的一个战士，现在守卫在祖国的海防线上。我是独生子，家里只有一个六十多岁的母亲和一位正在念书的小妹妹。一九五一年，伟大的抗美援朝运动激起了我的爱国主义和国际主义热情，志愿参军到朝鲜前线作战。今年，学习了总路线，我懂得了小农经济的落后、保守性，阻碍着农业生产的提高，农民要解脱贫困，过富裕的生活，就必须走互助合作的道路，积极完成对农业的社会主义改造。因而，我一连写了几封信动员家里参加互助组和农业生产合作社。可是家里来信这样告诉我：“……因为我家没有劳动力，参加互助组别人不要。”编辑同志！我不明白，为什么农业生产合作社的组织者及其领导干部竟拒绝我家参加合作社呢？
    对于缺乏劳动力的烈属军属参加农业生产合作社的问题，应根据当地合作社的具体情况，在优先照顾的原则下，尽量吸收他们入社。这里所说的具体情况，包括：一、社内的劳动力和土地是否相适应，缺乏劳动力的人带了土地入社以后是否有力耕种；二、社的基础大小情况怎样，大的社就好照顾一些，小的社就很难照顾；三、社的领导方面对劳动力的组织有无经验，如有经验就可以充分发挥劳动力的效力，适当地安排缺乏劳动力的人作轻微的杂活，否则就相反；四、社员群众的政治觉悟程度高低如何，如果多数社员愿意吸收缺乏劳力的人入社，当然好办，否则，还要加强教育，等待觉悟。
    目前乡村中还有一部分缺乏劳动力的烈属军属没有被接受入社，这部分烈属军属的生产、生活都有困难，应该通过互助组和农业生产合作社予以扶助。吸收他们入社，并不等于要社负担全部的优抚任务。因为烈属军属入社以后，可以积极参加适合自己体力和技能的社内集体劳动，如：不能干重活，可以干轻活；不能干田间活，可以干其他杂活（喂牲口、看孩子……）；并根据他们的“劳动日”取得合理的报酬。缺乏劳动力的烈属军属一般都有代耕工，可以顶替社内的劳动日，极少数完全没有劳动能力的也可以带工票做为劳动力入社。至于烈属军属应得的代耕工票的处理，以归社顶替劳动力分红为好，即工票有几个工，烈属军属就可以按几个劳动日取得报酬。代耕工价归社所得，这样做是合乎集体劳动、按劳取酬的原则的。而社的劳动日的报酬一般是高于代耕工价的，这样对烈属军属也是有利的。现在也有将工票归烈属军属自己的现象。这是因为社办得不好，代耕工价大于社的劳动日报酬，所以烈属军属就不愿记劳动日而愿得代耕报酬。这种情况，各地应从改善社的经营管理来加以改变。
    至于有的地方还没有吸收缺乏劳动力的烈属军属入社，主要是：各地合作运动发展的基础不同，基础好的合作社，自然有力量积极照顾烈属军属；而基础差的合作社，为了首先取得合作社本身的巩固，所以暂时没有吸收缺乏劳动力户入社。其次，有些合作社的干部和社员有不正确的思想，他们只欢迎人强马壮的户入社，不欢迎缺劳力或缺车马户入社，甚至加以排斥。对于前一种情况，是需要随着社的工作的加强，逐步求得解决的，对于后一种情况，则必须纠正。
    总之，农业生产合作社在处理缺乏劳动力的烈属军属要求入社的具体问题时，应根据具体条件和优先照顾的原则。可以吸收而不吸收，排斥缺少劳动力的烈属军属的入社要求，当然是不对的。
