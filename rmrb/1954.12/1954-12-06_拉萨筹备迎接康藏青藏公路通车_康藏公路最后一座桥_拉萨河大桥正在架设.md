    Lhasa is preparing to welcome the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways.
    The last bridge on the Kangzang Highway – The Lhasa River Bridge – is under construction.
    People from all walks of life in Lhasa are preparing to welcome the full opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways. The Lhasa Preparatory Committee for the Grand Meeting Celebrating the Opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways, jointly formed by the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Tibetan local government, the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association, and the Patriotic Women's Federation, has been established. In recent days, many Tibetan laborers have been building parking lots in front of the Potala Palace. Citizens are tidying up and cleaning the streets, and most of the buildings in the city have been freshly painted. Many tall, colorful archways will be erected on the section of the highway from the Lhasa River Bridge to the parking lot, and at the meeting point of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways. Artists are rushing to produce huge slogans and various pattern paintings to be decorated on the archways. A new bridge will also be built over the small river adjacent to the parking lot, and the required timber will soon be transported from the forest area east of Lhasa. Workers from the Iron and Wood Factory affiliated to the Tibet Military Region have already rushed to manufacture various iron parts for the bridge. The Tibet Military Region is rushing to build four new-style houses, and has vacated buildings, prepared fuel, grain, and vegetables for guests coming from various places to participate in the opening ceremony.
    Members of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association, the Patriotic Women's Federation, and young male and female students from the cadre school of the Tibet Military Region are rehearsing Tibetan folk songs and dances as if they were welcoming a festival. The children of Lhasa Elementary School have also written letters of appreciation to the uncles who built the highway. The Literature and Art Troupe of the Tibet Military Region and various agencies and troops in Lhasa are also rushing to rehearse various literary and artistic programs in preparation for performances at the opening. Representatives and literary and art workers from various places to participate in the opening ceremony have arrived in Lhasa one after another.

    One day in the afternoon, the Qingzang Highway had been opened to traffic seventy kilometers away from Lhasa. Up to this point, the Qingzang Highway has been extended by more than 260 kilometers in half a month after the opening of traffic to Heihe. Now, the vast road construction team has crossed the Yangbajing grassland and entered a 15-kilometer mountain gorge for construction. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The last bridge on the Kangzang Highway – the Lhasa River Bridge – began construction on December 2. This is the first bridge built on the ancient Lhasa River. Tall pile drivers have been erected on the wide Lhasa River, and the folding boats of the ferrying and bridge-building personnel are shuttling back and forth on the river. Trucks are continuously transporting processed timber and steel transported from the mainland to the construction site. From the early morning of the 2nd, the workers went into the water to work, and the first bridge pile has now been driven. The Tibetan local troops also participated in the construction of the bridgehead roadbed.
    The Lhasa River Bridge is the longest bridge on the Kangzang Highway. After it is built, it can allow both cars and pedestrians to pass at the same time, and it can also be used as normal during the flood season. The workers, who have built many large bridges on the Kangzang Highway in the past few years, have put their skilled technology and high enthusiasm into their work, and they said that they must build this last bridge quickly and well.
    A few days ago, the good news that a bridge was to be built on the Lhasa River spread throughout Lhasa City and its suburbs. On the day of the start of construction, groups of men and women Tibetan people went to the river to watch, and Tibetan youths excitedly shouted and pulled ropes together with the pile drivers. The old people talked about: The highway has been built, and the bridge is about to be built, which is really gratifying! (Xinhua News Agency)

    拉萨筹备迎接康藏青藏公路通车
    康藏公路最后一座桥——拉萨河大桥正在架设
    拉萨市各界人民正在筹备迎接康藏、青藏公路全线通车。由中国人民解放军西藏军区、西藏地方政府、拉萨市爱国青年文化联谊会和爱国妇女联谊会等单位联合组成的庆祝康藏、青藏公路通车拉萨大会筹备委员会已经成立。连日来，许多藏族民工正在布达拉宫前修筑汽车停车场。市民们在整理和打扫街道，市区的房屋已大部粉刷一新。从拉萨河大桥到停车场的一段公路上和康藏、青藏两条公路的会合点，将搭设起许多座高大的彩色牌坊。美术工作者正赶制将要装饰在牌坊上的巨幅标语和各种图案画。紧临停车场的小河上，还要架设一座新的桥梁，所需的木料即将从拉萨东部的森林区运来。西藏军区所属铁木工厂的工人，已经为这座桥赶制了各种铁件。西藏军区正在赶修四幢新式房屋，并为从各处来参加通车典礼的客人腾出了楼房，准备了燃料、粮食和菜蔬。
    拉萨市爱国青年文化联谊会、爱国妇女联谊会的会员和西藏军区干部学校的男女青年学员们，像迎接节日一样排演着西藏的民族歌舞。拉萨小学的孩子们还为修筑公路的叔叔们写了慰问信。西藏军区文艺工作团和拉萨各机关、部队也都在赶排各种文艺节目，准备在通车时上演。从各地来参加通车典礼的代表和文艺工作者已经先后前来拉萨。

    青藏公路一日下午已通车到离拉萨七十公里处。至此，青藏公路在通车黑河后的半个月内，已向前延伸二百六十多公里了。现在，浩大的筑路队伍已经跨过羊八井草原，开进一条十五公里的山峡里施工。　（新华社）
    康藏公路最后一座桥梁——拉萨河大桥已在十二月二日动工修建。这是在古老的拉萨河上兴建的第一座桥梁。宽阔的拉萨河上竖起了高大的打桩架，摆渡架桥人员的折叠舟穿梭行驶在河面上。汽车正源源不断地把加工好了的木料和从内地运来的钢材运到工地。从二日清早，工人们就下水工作，现已打下第一根桥桩。西藏地方部队也参加了修筑桥头路基的工作。
    拉萨河大桥是康藏公路上最长的桥梁，修好后可以同时通行汽车和行人，洪水季节也可照常通行。几年来在康藏公路上架过很多座大桥的工人们，以熟练的技术和高涨的热情投入了工作，他们表示一定要把这最后一座桥梁架得又快又好。
    几天以前，拉萨河上要架设大桥的喜讯就传遍了拉萨市内和郊区。开工这天，男女藏民成群结队到河边观看，藏族青年们兴奋地和打桩工人一起呼喊着拉起绳子。老人们在谈论着：公路修通了，桥也要架设好了，真使人高兴啊！　（新华社）
