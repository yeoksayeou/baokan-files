The Beijing Grain Depot has cleaned a total of 228,510,000 jin of grain affected by insects in the past two months, clearing 12,341 jin of rice weevils. If we calculate that one jin of rice weevils contains 288,000 insects and that one adult rice weevil eats 0.039 milligrams of grain per day, these grain insects would consume 830,000 jin of grain in one month. Based on a consumption of 1.5 jin of grain per person per day, this amount of grain could supply 550,000 people for one day. Removing the insects not only reduces grain loss but also preserves the nutritional value of the grain. Grain that has been mechanically sieved also has 754,000 jin of impurities such as insect droppings, grass, dust, and sand removed, increasing the purity of the grain and preventing spoilage. At the same time, after eliminating the grain insects, the granaries underwent cleaning and sanitation, and the mats and sacks were fumigated and disinfected, eliminating 573 jin of overwintering grain insects.

This pest control work was carried out by a temporary organization established by the Municipal People's Government Grain Bureau, with the direct participation and leadership of the directors of each warehouse, and with the assistance and guidance of the Ministry of Food and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Methods such as machine sieving, manual sieving, and insecticide application were widely used. When hydrocyanic acid gas was used for disinfection at the Fengtai Grain Warehouse, comrades from the Chinese Academy of Sciences provided specific technical guidance. The Xizhimen Grain Depot created a grain hopper at the top of the sieve, and the Eastern Suburbs Grain Depot trial-produced a double-layered sieve bottom, which improved the efficiency of pest control. In mid-November, the Municipal Grain Bureau also conducted a major re-inspection of the wheat inventory and established a regular inspection system.

This insect-infested grain was transferred in from various places since the summer of this year. Due to the failure to take timely measures in advance, a large amount of grain became infested with insects. This pest control work has created conditions for pest control work next year.

    首都粮库清除米象
    北京市粮库两个月来共清理了二亿二千八百五十一万斤发生虫害的粮食，清除米象一万二千三百四十一斤。如按一市斤米象有二十八万八千个、一个米象成虫一天吃粮零点零三九毫克计算，这些仓虫一个月内就要吃掉八十三万斤粮食，按每人每天吃粮食一斤半计算，这些粮食就可供应五十五万人一天的食粮。除虫不仅减少了粮食的损失，并且可以保持粮食的营养价值。经过机械过筛的粮食，还清除了虫粪、草、灰尘、沙土等杂质七十五万四千多斤，提高了粮食的纯度，防止粮食的霉坏。同时，除治仓虫后粮仓又进行了清洁卫生工作，把席子、茓子、麻袋进行熏蒸消毒，消灭了越冬的仓虫五百七十三斤。
    这次除虫工作，是由市人民政府粮食局建立临时组织，在各仓库主任直接参加领导，并在粮食部和中国科学院的协助指导下进行的，普遍使用了机器溜筛、人工溜筛、药剂杀虫等方法。在丰台粮食仓库使用氢酸气药剂消毒时，中国科学院同志在技术上作了具体的指导。西直门粮仓创造了在溜筛上端装粮斗、东郊粮仓试制了双层筛底，提高了除虫效率。十一月中旬市粮食局又对库存小麦进行了大复查，并建立了定期的检查制度。
    这些虫粮，是今年入夏以来从各地调进来的，由于事先没有及时采取措施，造成大量粮食生虫。这次除治仓虫工作，给明年的除治工作创造了条件。
