    On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the birth of the great peace warrior Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin, the Stalin International Prize “For Strengthening Peace Among Peoples” Committee announced the decision on the list of awardees for 1954.
    The committee, composed of representatives of democratic public figures from various countries, awarded the prizes to a new group of outstanding warriors striving for peace and friendship among peoples.
    The Stalin International Peace Prize is the highest international award, granted to those who have made contributions to the struggle for maintaining and consolidating peace. It is worth pointing out that the Stalin International Peace Prize is awarded to citizens of various countries, regardless of their political views or religious beliefs. As in previous years, we see among this year’s awardees prominent figures with various political views, but they all share a common goal—defending peace, and they contribute all their strength and energy to peace.
    Among the active peace warriors who have won this year's prize is D.N. Pritt, a famous British social activist and chairman of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers. D.N. Pritt, well-known not only in the UK but also internationally, is an unyielding worker who has dedicated all his energy to the cause of peace. Mentioning his name makes one think of him as a most honest, unimpeachable politician, a person with firm beliefs and a high sense of social responsibility. Pritt is one of the most authoritative experts in law. He received the title of King's Counsel in 1927, and he has been actively involved in British political and social life for many years. Everyone knows his contributions to exposing the crimes of German war criminals. Every word written by this outstanding jurist is regarded as the testimony of an impartial observer. For example, Pritt’s famous pamphlets on the Korean War are like that, in which he revealed the truth about the Korean incident. Our committee is convinced that the decision to award the Stalin International Peace Prize to D.N. Pritt will be welcomed with satisfaction by the broad public in all circles of Britain.
    Alain Le Leap, an outstanding representative of the French workers' movement and general secretary of the French General Confederation of Labor, deservedly received the lofty title of Stalin International Peace Prize laureate. Alain Le Leap has been dedicated to the cause of protecting the interests of working people for more than 20 years. By participating in the struggle for the economic interests of workers, he naturally actively participated in the struggle for peace, against the threat of new wars, and against the arms race that can only bring poverty to working people. He tirelessly called on the trade union movement in his country to take vigorous action against plans to instigate new wars. In order to explain to working people their tasks in this struggle, he wrote a pamphlet explaining what dangers the plan to establish the European Defense Community posed to France. He once stood at the forefront of the struggle against the Indochina War. Today, he is once again joining other French patriots in opposing the London and Paris agreements, which directly threaten French national interests. The French trade union movement has made outstanding contributions to this patriotic struggle of the people. Awarding the Stalin International Peace Prize to Alain Le Leap, an active fighter for the interests of working people and a patriot, is an internationally recognized expression of his merits to his motherland and to the people of the world.
    Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, a social activist from Burma and an outstanding representative of Burmese culture, also won the Stalin International Peace Prize. This writer, historian, philosopher, and veteran of the Burmese people's national liberation struggle, Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, is highly respected in his country, and the people affectionately call him "the Great Elder of Burma." In his long life, he has written about one hundred plays, novels, long poems, and songs, educating a whole generation of fighters for Burmese national independence. He has also written books on the history of international relations and on Burmese cultural and literary history, many of which have been adopted as general textbooks.
    During the British rule in Burma, Thakin Kodaw Hmaing led the "Dobama Asiayone" party, which aimed to liberate the motherland from foreign oppression. At that time, this party played a significant role in the political life of the country, uniting all national forces around it. After World War II, we saw Thakin Kodaw Hmaing actively fighting for peace in Asia and the world. In May 1952, the First Burmese Peace Congress elected him as the chairman of the National Committee of the Congress. Under the leadership of this committee, approximately one million signatures were collected in Burma for a declaration demanding the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. Thakin Kodaw Hmaing has repeatedly spoken out against the Korean War and against the conspiracies of American imperialism in Southeast Asia. Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, the great writer of the Burmese people and the veteran of the Burmese people's national liberation struggle, today embodies the good aspirations of the Burmese people. Awarding him the Stalin International Peace Prize is a well-deserved reward for his many years of progressive activities and will be greatly welcomed by the Burmese people.
    Among the Stalin International Peace Prize laureates is Bertolt Brecht, an outstanding German poet and playwright, who is very well-known in Germany. Brecht became a staunch fighter against militarism as early as the years after World War I. His "Song of the Fallen Soldier" was one of the most popular anti-war works in Germany at that time. Later, Brecht became a poet beloved by the masses. When the German people were under Hitler's iron heel, he created meaningful works abroad, such as "Terror and Misery of the Third Reich," which played a huge role in the anti-fascist struggle.
    Since 1947, Brecht lived in the German Democratic Republic and actively participated in the construction of a new life for the German people. Many of his works, permeated with the ideas of striving for peace and democracy and striving for human happiness, are very popular in both eastern and western Germany. Brecht stood at the forefront of the patriotic forces of the German people, striving for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, opposing the growing threat of German militarism, and striving for peace and friendship between the German people and other peoples.
    The committee awarded the prize to Felix Iversen, a famous Finnish scholar and social activist. Peace advocates in Finland and Scandinavian countries know him and regard him as a sincere and selfless figure in the pacifist movement. The pacifist movement began as early as the 1920s. World War I and its consequences had a decisive impact on the worldview of this young scholar, and he decided to dedicate his life to the cause of defending peace. Since 1926, he has been the leader of the pacifist organization "Finnish Peace League," and since 1935, he has been the chairman of the "Nordic Countries Peace League" (Scandinavian countries pacifist league organization).
    After World War II, the movement of peace advocates unfolded, and Felix Iversen participated in this movement without hesitation. In 1949, when he spoke at the congress of the "Finnish Peace League," he said: "The program of peace advocates is a program that all true friends of peace can unconditionally support." The "Finnish Peace League" he led collectively joined the "Finnish Peace Advocates" organization, and Iversen himself served as the vice-chairman of this organization. He launched a vigorous struggle against the expansion of armaments and against the remilitarization of West Germany. Iversen believed that the guarantee of the security of the Scandinavian countries was that the countries of this peninsula did not join any aggressive alliance and pursued a peaceful policy.
    The awarding of the Stalin Peace Prize to Felix Iversen shows that the struggle for peace unites all kind people, regardless of their political views. Sincere and upright pacifists can always find a common language with all peace advocates in defending the vital interests of all peoples.
    Another laureate is André Bonnard, a famous Swiss linguist well-known in Western European scientific and public circles. Although Professor Bonnard's scientific interests are related to the ancient world—for many years he taught ancient Greek language and literature at the University of Lausanne—he did not shut himself in his scientific palace. He understood the connection between science and current tasks. Therefore, after the Wroclaw World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace in 1948, when the movement of intellectuals defending peace was widely launched in European countries, Professor Bonnard did not stand idly by. He first initiated the uniting of all peace-loving people in Switzerland into a unified movement. Professor Bonnard has been leading the Swiss Peace Committee since 1949. As a true scholar loyal to the interests of the people, Professor Bonnard has always stood at the forefront of the contemporary progressive movement to defend peace, regardless of all attacks.
    The awarding of the Stalin Prize to the outstanding scholar and famous politician Baldomero Sanín Cano will be warmly welcomed by the masses in Latin America. In the eyes of the Latin American people, Baldomero Sanín Cano is the most outstanding representative of humanism and liberalism, and he has been faithful to humanism and liberalism throughout his long life. Sanín Cano's activities and knowledge are very diverse. He wrote many linguistic works and was proficient in European literature. He was awarded honorary doctoral degrees by the University of Edinburgh and the University of Bogotá for his academic achievements. At the same time, he was an outstanding activist of the Colombian Liberal Party and has held important diplomatic positions at home and abroad. Sanín Cano is a person who firmly believes in democratic principles, and his actions are upright.
    From the initial stage of the movement to defend peace in Colombia and Latin America, Sanín Cano participated in the ranks of this movement, and he is now the honorary chairman of the Colombian National Peace Committee. He is very old, but he has never put down his pen as a political commentator. He often calls on the people to oppose war propaganda and oppose American imperialism's infringement on the freedom and independence of Colombia and other countries in South America. The reactionary's several attacks on Sanín Cano have not been able to force him to abandon the beliefs he has drawn from his long and upright life. He has repeatedly praised the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union as a beacon of freedom and progress and a fortress of the independence and security of all peoples. Awarding the Stalin International Prize to Baldomero Sanín Cano is a recognition of his outstanding merits to the people of all Latin American countries and to the cause of defending world peace.
    The Stalin International Prize was awarded to a representative of Indonesia for the first time. Professor Priyono is a famous cultural worker in Indonesia and an active fighter for defending peace in Asia and the world. Professor Priyono is a famous linguist and also an active social activist and the vice-chairman of the Indonesian National Peace Committee. It is known that in Indonesia, the movement of the whole people to strive for national independence and for peace has recently reached a huge scale.
    The Indonesian people are fighting to completely get rid of their country's dependence on foreign countries and against the aggressive bloc that American imperialism wants to drag Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries into. Awarding the Stalin Peace Prize to the representative of Indonesia shows that this struggle of the Indonesian people has won the international democratic public opinion's recognition and support.
    Another laureate is Guillén, the great Cuban poet, famous social activist and political commentator. His poems have very profound popular appeal. These poems are not only very popular in Cuba, but also in various Latin American countries. His poems have been translated into French, German, English, Portuguese, and other countries' languages, and many of them have been set to music.
    In 1952, Guillén published a collection of poems called "Doves of All People." This collection of poems is an example of battle poems defending peace and opposing American imperialism's oppression of Latin American countries. Guillén visited all Latin American countries and many European countries. During his visits, he recited his own poems everywhere, calling for the struggle for the liberation of all peoples and for peace and democracy. Awarding the Stalin Peace Prize to Guillén is a new encouragement to this poet who has dedicated his brilliant talent to peace and the freedom of all peoples.
    The struggle to defend peace is constantly expanding and strengthening, sweeping across all countries and all continents. It is constantly producing batches of new figures who are trusted and loved by the broad masses of the people because of their noble activities. Our committee would like to express the gratitude of the people of all countries to these people, who have dedicated all the strength, energy, and talent of their souls to achieve the most noble goal of the contemporary era—to ensure the peaceful and friendly cooperation of all peoples, regardless of skin color, social system, or national system.

    杰出的和平战士
    “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会主席
    苏联科学院院士
    斯科贝尔琴
    在伟大的和平战士约·维·斯大林诞生七十五周年的时候，“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金委员会公布了关于一九五四年授奖名单的决议。
    由各国民主公众代表组成的委员会把奖金授予新的一批杰出的争取各国人民和平和友谊的战士。
    斯大林国际和平奖金是国际所公认的最高的奖赏，它授予在维护和巩固和平的斗争中有功绩的人。值得指出的是，斯大林国际和平奖金是授予各国公民，而不分政治观念和宗教信仰的不同的。正如历年的情况一样，我们在今年的受奖人当中又再次看到有各种不同政治见解的著名人物，但是他们都有一个共同的目标——保卫和平，他们为和平贡献出全部的力量和精力。
    在荣获本届奖金的积极的和平战士当中，有丹尼斯·普里特——有名的英国社会活动家、国际民主法律工作者协会主席。不仅在英国国内知名，而且在国际上知名的丹尼斯·普里特，是将自己全部精力贡献给和平事业的不屈不挠的工作者。提起他的名字就使人想到他是一个最正直的、无可指摘的政治家，是一个有坚定信仰和高度社会责任感的人。普里特在法律学方面是最有权威的一位专家，一九二七年获得皇家律师的称号，他积极参加英国的政治和社会生活已经有好多年了。大家都知道，他在揭露德国战犯罪行方面的功绩。这位杰出的法律学家笔下所写的每一字句都被大家视为不偏不倚的观察者的见证。例如，普里特所写的关于朝鲜战争的有名的几本小册子就是这样的，在这些小册子中他揭穿了朝鲜事件的真相。我们委员会确信，将斯大林国际和平奖金授予丹尼斯·普里特的决定，将获得英国各界广大公众的满意的欢迎。
    法国工人运动的杰出代表和法国总工会总书记阿兰·勒里普获得斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人的崇高称号是当之无愧的。阿兰·勒里普致力于保护劳动人民利益的事业已经有二十多年了。由于参加争取职工经济利益的斗争，他自然而然地积极参加了争取和平、反对新战争威胁以及反对只能给劳动人民带来贫困的军备竞赛的斗争。他不倦地号召本国的工会运动采取有力的行动，反对策动新战争的计划。为了向劳动人民解释他们在这一斗争中的任务，他写了一本小册子，说明建立欧洲防务集团的计划对法国具有什么样的危险。他曾经站在为反对印度支那战争而斗争的最前列。今天，他又和法国的其他爱国者一同来反对直接威胁着法国民族利益的伦敦协定和巴黎协定。法国的工会运动对人民这一个爱国的斗争有着出色的贡献。把斯大林国际和平奖金授予为劳动人民利益而奋斗的积极战士和爱国者阿兰·勒里普，就是国际上公认他对自己祖国以及对全世界人民的功勋的一个表示。
    缅甸的社会活动家、缅甸杰出的文化界代表德钦哥都迈也获得了斯大林国际和平奖金。这位作家、史学家、哲学家、缅甸人民民族解放斗争的老战士德钦哥都迈在国内极受尊敬，人民爱慕地称呼他为“缅甸伟大的长者”。他在一生的长久岁月中写了约一百部剧本、小说、长诗和歌曲，教育出整整一代为缅甸民族独立而奋斗的战士。他还写了一些关于各国关系史、关于缅甸文化史和文学史的书籍，其中有许多被采用作为通用的教科书。
    在英国统治缅甸的时期，德钦哥都迈领导了以把祖国从外国压迫下解放出来为宗旨的“德钦党”。那时，这个党在国家的政治生活中起了重大的作用，曾经把一切民族力量团结在自己的周围，在第二次世界大战以后，我们看到德钦哥都迈在积极地为亚洲和世界和平而斗争。一九五二年五月，第一届缅甸和平大会选举他为大会全国委员会的主席。在这个委员会的领导下，在缅甸为要求缔结五大国和平公约的宣言征集了约一百万个签名。德钦哥都迈曾经不止一次地发表言论反对朝鲜战争，反对美国帝国主义在东南亚的阴谋。缅甸人民伟大的作家、缅甸人民民族解放斗争的元老德钦哥都迈今天也体现着缅甸人民美好的愿望。授予他斯大林国际和平奖金，是他多年进步活动应得的奖励，并将受到缅甸人民极大的欢迎。
    在斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人中有一个是卓越的德国诗人和剧作家贝托尔特·布莱希特，他在德国是很有名的。布莱希特早在第一次世界大战以后的年代中就成了一名反对军国主义的坚定战士。他的“阵亡士兵之歌”是当时德国最受欢迎的反战作品之一。后来，布莱希特成了广大群众所热爱的诗人。当德国人民处在希特勒的铁蹄下的时候，他在国外创造了很有意义的作品，例如“第三帝国的恐怖和绝望”等，这些作品在反法西斯斗争中起了巨大的作用。
    从一九四七年起，布莱希特住在德意志民主共和国，积极地参加了德国人民新生活的建设。他的许多贯穿着争取和平和民主，争取人类幸福的思想的作品在德国东部和西部都非常流行。布莱希特站在争取和平统一祖国、反对日益增长的德国军国主义威胁，争取德国人民和其他各国人民的和平和友好的德国人民的爱国力量的最前列。
    委员会授予著名的芬兰学者、社会活动家费利克斯·伊维尔逊奖金。芬兰和斯堪的纳维亚国家的和平拥护者都知道他，把他看作是和平主义运动的一个真诚无私的人物。和平主义运动早在二十年代就开始了。第一次世界大战及其后果对于这位年轻学者的世界观起了决定性的影响，他决定把自己的一生奉献给保卫和平的事业。从一九二六年起，他是和平主义组织“芬兰和平联盟”的领导人，从一九三五年起，他是“北欧国家和平联盟”（斯堪的纳维亚国家和平主义联盟组织）的主席。
    在第二次世界大战以后，展开了和平拥护者运动，费利克斯·伊维尔逊毫不犹豫地参加了这个运动。一九四九年他在“芬兰和平联盟”代表大会上发言时说：“和平拥护者的纲领是这样一个纲领：所有和平的真正朋友们都可以无条件地拥护它。”他所领导的“芬兰和平联盟”集体加入了“芬兰和平拥护者”组织，而伊维尔逊本人则担任了这个组织的副主席。他展开了反对扩张军备和反对西德重新军国主义化的有力斗争。伊维尔逊认为斯堪的纳维亚各国的安全的保证就是：这个半岛的各个国家不加入任何侵略同盟并且执行和平政策。
    授予费利克斯·伊维尔逊斯大林和平奖金这件事表明：争取和平的斗争团结了一切善良的人们，不问他们的政治观点如何，真诚正直的和平主义者，在保卫各国人民切身利益上是永远和一切和平拥护者可以找到共同的语言。
    其次一个得奖人是西欧科学界和公众所共知的瑞士著名语言学家安德烈·邦纳。虽然邦纳教授的科学兴趣是与古代的世界相关联的——多年来他一直在洛桑大学教授古希腊语和文学——但是，他并没有把自己关闭在他的科学之宫里，他理解到了科学和当前任务的联系。因此，在一九四八年弗罗茨拉夫世界文化工作者保卫和平大会后，当知识分子保卫和平的运动在欧洲各国广泛开展起来的时候，邦纳教授并没有袖手旁观。他首先发起把瑞士所有爱好和平的人士联合到一个统一的运动中来。邦纳教授从一九四九年起一直领导着瑞士和平委员会。邦纳教授作为一个忠于人民利益的真正的学者，不顾一切攻击，始终站在当代进步的保卫和平运动的最前列。
    杰出的学者和著名的政治家巴尔多麦罗·萨宁·卡诺的荣获斯大林奖金将受到拉丁美洲群众的热烈欢迎。在拉丁美洲人民的眼中，巴尔多麦罗·萨宁·卡诺是人道主义和自由主义的最卓越的代表，他在自己长期的生活中一直忠实于人道主义和自由主义。萨宁·卡诺的活动和知识是非常多方面的。他写了许多语言学著作，精通欧洲的文学。他因他的学术功绩荣获爱丁堡大学和波哥大大学的荣誉博士学位。同时，他是哥伦比亚自由党的杰出活动家，并曾在国内和国外担任过重要的外交官职位。萨宁·卡诺是一个坚信民主原则的人，他的行动正直。
    从哥伦比亚和拉丁美洲保卫和平运动的最初阶段起，萨宁·卡诺就参加了这个运动的行列，现在他是哥伦比亚全国和平委员会的名誉主席。他的年龄很大了，但是他从没有放下他的政论家的笔，他经常号召人民反对战争宣传，反对美国帝国主义侵犯哥伦比亚和南美洲其他国家的自由和独立。反动派对萨宁·卡诺的数次攻击都没有能够迫使他抛弃他从长期正直的生活中吸取的信念。他曾不止一次地称赞以苏联为首的民主阵营是自由和进步的灯塔，是各国人民的独立和安全的堡垒。授予巴尔多麦罗·萨宁·卡诺斯大林国际奖金就是表彰他对拉丁美洲各国人民、对保卫世界和平的事业的杰出功绩。
    斯大林国际奖金第一次授予印度尼西亚的代表。普里约诺教授是印度尼西亚的一个著名的文化工作者，是保卫亚洲和世界和平的积极战士。普里约诺教授是一个著名的语言学家，同时也是一个积极的社会活动家，是印度尼西亚全国和平委员会的副主席。大家知道，在印度尼西亚，全国人民争取民族独立、争取和平的运动近来达到了巨大的规模。
    印度尼西亚人民在为使祖国彻底摆脱对外国的依附、为反对美国帝国主义想把印度尼西亚和其他东南亚国家拖进去的侵略集团而斗争。把斯大林和平奖金授给印度尼西亚代表这件事说明，印度尼西亚人民的这种斗争得到了国际民主舆论的公认和支持。
    得奖人中还有古巴的大诗人、著名的社会活动家和政论家纪廉。他的诗有很深刻的人民性，这些诗不仅在古巴很受欢迎，在拉丁美洲大陆各国也很受欢迎。他的诗译成了法文、德文、英文、葡萄牙文和其他各国的文字，其中有许多谱了曲。
    一九五二年，纪廉出了一本名叫“全民的鸽子”的诗集，这本诗集是保卫和平、反对美国帝国主义压迫拉丁美洲国家的战斗诗篇的范例。纪廉访问了所有的拉丁美洲国家和许多欧洲国家，他在访问中到处朗诵自己写的、号召为各国人民的解放、为和平和民主而斗争的诗篇。授给纪廉斯大林和平奖金一事对这位把自己光辉的天才献给和平和各国人民的自由的诗人是一个新的鼓舞。
    保卫和平的斗争不断扩大和不断加强，席卷了所有的国家和所有的大陆。它不断地产生着一批批的新人物，这些人物由于自己崇高的活动而为广大的人民群众所信任和爱戴。我们的委员会要向这样一些人表示各国人民的感谢，这些人为了达到当代最崇高的目标——保障不分肤色，不分社会制度和国家制度的各国人民的和平和友好的合作，献出自己灵魂的全部力量，全部精力和天才。
