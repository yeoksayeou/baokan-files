Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th—TASS reports: The Second All-Union Writers' Congress continued its discussion of reports and supplementary reports on various issues of Soviet literature at its December 18th session. The meeting also heard reports on Soviet drama and Soviet film scripts.

At the December 18th session, the speakers in the discussion included prose writer V. Kaverin, poet Ya. Prokofiev, Belarusian writer P. Brovka, and Moldavian writer A. Lupan, among others. In their speeches, they discussed issues related to literary techniques and the development of literature in various Soviet ethnic groups.

Subsequently, the well-known Soviet writer A. Korneichuk delivered a report on Soviet drama.

In his report, Korneichuk spoke about the achievements of Soviet dramatic art. He pointed out that the twenty years since the First All-Union Writers' Congress have been a period of growth and maturity for Soviet dramatic art. During this period, Soviet dramatic art has developed into a multi-ethnic art. The theaters of various Soviet ethnic groups have grown and developed, and various ethnic groups have produced their own playwrights, who have brilliantly depicted the lives, struggles, and characters of their own people, and have portrayed the character of the entire Soviet people more deeply and vividly.

Korneichuk's report then discussed some of the shortcomings in the development of Soviet dramatic art after the Great Patriotic War and some issues relating to the creation of positive characters in dramas. In addition, he spoke about the tasks of Soviet dramatists in creating satirical works, as well as strengthening cooperation between theaters and writers in creation, improving the language of dramas, and studying the theory of drama.

Soviet People's Artist S. Gerasimov delivered a report on Soviet film scripts at the evening session.

Gerasimov said that Soviet film art is inseparable from literature, and some famous Soviet writers have actively and creatively participated in the creation of film scripts. In their creations, they work closely with film actors, which determines the success of many film works. In his report, Gerasimov also cited many famous films to illustrate the achievements of Soviet film in the past twenty years.

Gerasimov then said that the realistic tradition of Soviet film art and its inseparable connection with the people are examples for filmmakers in various people's democratic countries and the great People's China. Soviet filmmakers have also gained good experience in cooperating with filmmakers from various people's democratic countries.

In his report, Gerasimov also pointed out the current shortcomings of Soviet film work. He called on writers to participate more actively and diligently in the creation of films that can truly spread the great ideas of peace and friendship among all peoples and the happiness of mankind.

After Gerasimov's report, the speakers at the meeting included the veteran Russian writer Fyodor Gladkov, the famous film actor Nikolai Cherkasov, and the Ukrainian writer Natan Rybak.

At the December 18th session, Leon Kruczkowski, Chairman of the Polish Writers' Union and winner of the "Strengthening International Peace" Stalin Prize, and Anna Seghers, a representative of the literary community of the German Democratic Republic, delivered congratulatory messages to the congress. Their speeches were warmly welcomed.
