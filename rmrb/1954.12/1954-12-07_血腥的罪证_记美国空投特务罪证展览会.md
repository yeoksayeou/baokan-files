    Bloody Evidence
    ——Record of the U.S. Air-Dropped Special Agent Evidence Exhibition
    Lin Hong
    The U.S. Air-Dropped Special Agent Evidence Exhibition, organized by the Ministry of Public Security, opened on the 6th at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace.

    The exhibition systematically exposes the criminal facts of the U.S. aggressors airdropping special agents into our country through a large number of physical evidences, documents, photographs and charts. People who come here to carefully look at the various exhibits and charts will definitely deepen their understanding of the U.S. aggressors and arouse their hatred for the U.S. aggressors' aggression against our country; at the same time, it will inevitably make them more deeply feel that in order to protect the country's socialist construction and ensure the safety of the people's lives and property, everyone must resolutely overcome any thoughts of complacency and be prepared to fight against all hidden enemies at all times and in all places.

    In the spacious exhibition room, we first saw several descriptions and charts, which recorded the general situation of the U.S. aggressors airdropping special agents into our country in recent years. From 1951 to 1954, the spy agencies of the U.S. aggressors and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique successively airdropped a group of special agents into various parts of our country, including bandit commanders, action captains, intelligence chiefs, special agent team leaders, and radio station personnel. These special agents, in addition to carrying various telecommunications equipment and cryptographic secret writing agents, etc., ready to contact U.S. spy agencies in Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and other places at any time, generally carried various guns and ammunition. Their task was not only to spy on our country's military, political and economic intelligence, but also to attempt to establish so-called "guerrilla bases" and "airdrop sites" within our country, and to attempt to organize other counter-revolutionary armed forces, gather the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, as well as bandits, despots, and social scum such as hooligans and vagrants, and conspire to take the opportunity to create armed riots, attempting to prepare for the U.S. aggressive war against the people of our country. However, the U.S. aggressors and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique completely miscalculated. These few descriptions and charts in front of us tell us in striking words: the batches of special agents they airdropped were all captured alive by us, or shot dead on the spot. The various tools and equipment carried by the special agents have become powerful evidence to expose the crimes of their master - the U.S. aggressors. The chart says: in the past three years or so, we have captured alive and killed a total of 230 U.S. special agents. Among the various pieces of evidence seized, there were 998 guns alone, 179,000 rounds of ammunition (ammunition seized in Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South regions not included), as well as 6 six-zero mortars, 96 radio stations, and a large number of tools for special agent activities and survival.

    Walking forward from here, the following exhibits are the relevant materials of seven U.S. special agent cases, which are an epitome of the U.S.'s criminal activities of airdropping special agents into our country. Among these batches of U.S. spies and special agents captured and killed by us, four Americans, including Downey, were captured alive with two killed after their plane was shot down while secretly entering our country's Northeast airspace, attempting to pick up the ground agent Li Junying in flight. Fourteen Americans, including Arnold, were captured alive with eleven killed and three dead after their plane was shot down while secretly entering our country's Northeast airspace to conduct espionage reconnaissance activities. In addition, some were directly dispatched by the U.S. "Central Intelligence Agency" and its subordinate spy agencies, the so-called "Free China Movement Headquarters," and some were dispatched by the spy agencies of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique under U.S. control. Regardless of whether the special agents were airdropped by the U.S. or by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, most of them were military and political personnel of the Chiang gang, veteran special agents, and bandits, despots, etc. Some of them ran to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek, and some fled to Hong Kong, Macao and other places after the national liberation, joined the U.S. spy agencies, and successively received so-called political warfare, underground warfare, demolition warfare, guerrilla warfare, communication and liaison, and airdrop parachuting specialized training in U.S. spy training institutions in Maoqi, Saipan Island, and Taiwan, Japan. After the spy agencies of the U.S. aggressors and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique selected the airdrop area and formulated the airdrop plan, they selected some local people among them who were familiar with the terrain of the airdrop area and had old reactionary relations, organized them into groups, and used U.S. planes to airdrop them in mountainous areas, lakes, or sparsely populated areas where provinces and provinces, counties and counties intersect. The various evidences of these U.S. special agents' criminal activities are displayed here. In addition to various guns and ammunition, there are military maps of our Northeast region printed in Washington used by U.S. spies and special agents of the Downey and Fick pattern, maps of airdrop targets such as Yijiadian, Guangshan, Henan, photos of the wreckage of U.S. planes shot down and specially used for special agent activities, intelligence drafts issued by U.S. special agent Zhang Zaiwen and others to U.S. spy agencies, excerpts from the notes of U.S. special agents when they were trained in the Chiang Kai-shek's "Air-Drop Liaison Team of the Guerrilla Cadre Training Class of the Ministry of National Defense" in Tamsui, Taiwan, which recorded the outlines of military intelligence that special agents should collect after landing. Also displayed here are the so-called "Headquarters of the Anti-Communist Assault Column of the People in the Suwan Border Region" printed by the "Taiwan Printing Factory," the appointment orders, the so-called appointment orders given by Mao Renfeng, the head of the Chiang Kai-shek's Secret Bureau, to an air-dropped special agent, and the letters of the Chiang Kai-shek's pseudo-Ministry of National Defense brought by the bandits and special agents, various forged certificates and tools for forging certificates made by the bandits and special agents, and various U.S.-made transceivers, radio-telephone dual-use machines, hand-cranked generators, aerial measuring instruments, telegram codes, communication manuals, secret writing agents, as well as glove pistols and pen flashlights and other evidences specially used for special agent activities. In addition, there are various appliances and materials specially used by special agents for survival and activities. Such as tents, shovels, files, sickles, wood knives, fishing gear, medicines, needles and threads, as well as various canned foods and cooking utensils. A navigation station is also placed here, which was brought by the U.S. special agent "Wen Team" in the Downey and Fick pattern. In August 1952, when Downey used a plane to secretly enter the airspace of Jilin Province, China, to airdrop food and other supplies for the "Wen Team," he contacted the special agents through this navigation station. The wreckage of the planes used by U.S. spies Arnold and Downey and others is also displayed here. On a wall in another part of the exhibition room is Arnold's handwritten confession, in which he confessed that the "581st Air Supply and Communications Wing" was directly controlled by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency through the "581" Air Force system, and was used to carry out special agent activities against China and the Far Eastern coastal areas of the Soviet Union. On a tall rack in the courtyard outside the exhibition room hang various colors and sizes of parachutes. The staff of the exhibition told me that the reason why the parachutes are dyed in different colors is to make it difficult for the bandits and special agents to be discovered when they land after airdropping. For example, if you want to airdrop special agents on the snow, you generally use a white parachute, and if you want to airdrop special agents in the mountains and forest areas, you use a green parachute. An instrument specially used by U.S. spy agencies to pick up special agent personnel from the air is also displayed in the exhibition room, which was seized after Downey and Fick's plane was shot down by us while secretly entering the Northeast airspace.

    From the above-mentioned evidences of the U.S. airdropping special agents, it can be clearly seen that the U.S. aggressors have spent a lot of effort in carrying out the criminal activities of airdropping special agents in our country. Every batch of U.S. airdropped special agents tried their best to disguise themselves skillfully. As early as before they left Japan and Taiwan, they forged various certificates, and carried various tools for forging certificates with them when they were airdropped. For example, in a glass cabinet in the exhibition room, there are symbols, passports, injury memorial certificates, and Andong border quarantine certificates of our People's Liberation Army forged by U.S. airdropped special agents of the Downey and Fick pattern, as well as knives, wood, ink pads, and brushes for engraving seals; in another place, there are passes from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau forged by Ma Xincan and others, the bandits airdropped in the Anhui area, and uniforms of the Chinese People's Volunteers forged by U.S. special agents. However, despite this, the U.S. aggressors also knew that it would be very difficult for the special agents they airdropped to operate in our country, so they prepared various appliances and items for their lives and survival, from knives, ropes, axes, shovels, and spades for building tents, to pots, ladles, bowls, chopsticks, fish hooks, fishing lines, needles and threads, medicines, and barber supplies, and even flour, lard, and other items were airdropped. The U.S. aggressors were convinced that by doing so, the special agents who were airdropped could survive in the mountainous areas, and then take the opportunity to carry out sabotage activities. However, because its criminal activities are anti-people and will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the people of our country, no matter how insidious and vicious the U.S. aggressors' intentions are, and no matter how thoughtful they think, every batch of special agents quickly fall into the dragnet laid by the people of our country after being airdropped. Their fate is either to be captured alive or to be shot dead on the spot. A telegram draft is displayed in a glass cabinet, which was sent to the U.S. spy agency by the U.S. special agent "Shen Team" of the Downey and Fick pattern after landing, in which they said that the situation after their landing was "extremely dangerous." We also have a photo in front of us, which tells us that when the plane used by Downey and Fick was shot down by us, the local people quickly got the news, and the militiamen and the masses immediately went out to search for U.S. spies and special agents all over the mountains and fields, and finally quickly captured them. In another part of the exhibition room, I also saw the instructions given by the U.S. spy agency to a group of U.S. airdropped special agents, asking them to pay attention to collecting the people's sentiments in our country. It should be told to the U.S. aggressors that the facts recorded in this photo and the active assistance of the masses in many places to the People's Public Security Organs in searching for airdropped special agents are the most important manifestations of the people's sentiments in our country. If the U.S. aggressors do not respect the people's sentiments of our country, and stubbornly continue its despicable and shameless assassination and sabotage activities, then no matter whether special agent bandits enter our country from land, sea or air, their fate will never be better than the fate of those special agent bandits who have already been captured alive and killed.

    血腥的罪证
    ——记美国空投特务罪证展览会
    林洪
    公安部举办的美国空投特务罪证展览会，六日在北京劳动人民文化宫开幕。
    展览会用许多实物证件、照片和图表系统地揭露了美国侵略者在我国空投特务的罪恶事实。人们到这里来仔细地看一看陈列的各种实物和图表，就
  一定会加深他们对美国侵略者的认识，激起他们对美国侵略者侵略我国的憎恨；同时也必然会使他们更加深切地感觉到：为了保护国家的社会主义建设，保障人民生命财产的安全，每一个人都必须坚决克服任何麻痹大意的思想，随时随地准备同一切暗藏的敌人作斗争。
    在宽敞的展览室里，我们首先看见的是几幅说明和图表，上面记载着几年来美国侵略者在我国空投特务的概况。从一九五一年到一九五四年，美国侵略者及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团的间谍机关，先后在我国各地空投下来一批特务，其中有土匪司令、行动队长、情报处长、特务组长以及电台人员。这些特务除随身携带有各种电讯器材和密码密写药剂等物，准备随时和日本、台湾、香港等地的美国间谍机关取得联系以外，一般都携带有各种枪枝弹药。他们的任务不仅是刺探我国的军事、政治和经济等情报，而且妄想在我国境内建立所谓“游击根据地”和“空投场”，并企图组织其他反革命的武装，收罗蒋介石卖国集团的残余分子以及土匪、恶霸和地痞、流氓等社会渣滓，阴谋乘机制造武装暴乱，企图为美国对我国人民进行侵略战争作准备。但是美国侵略者及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团是完全失算了，这几张横在我们面前的说明和图表用醒目的字句告诉我们：他们空投下来的一批一批的特务统统被我们活捉了，或者当场被击毙了。特务们所携带的各种工具和器材，则成了揭露它们的主子——美国侵略者的罪行的有力证据。图表上说：在过去的三年多中间，我们活捉和击毙的美国特务共有二百三十名，在缴获的各种罪证中仅枪枝就有九百九十八枝，弹药有十七万九千发（在东北、华北、华东、中南地区缴获的弹药未计入），还有六○炮六门、电台九十六部以及大批供特务活动和求生的用具。
    从这里往前走，下面依次陈列着七个美国特务案件的有关材料，它们是美国在我国空投特务的罪恶活动的一个缩影。在这几批被我捕获和击毙的美国间谍特务中，唐奈等四个美国人是在乘用飞机秘密偷入我国东北领空，企图从空中取走地面特务李军英的一次飞行中被我击落后活捉两人，摔死两人。阿诺德等十四个美国人是乘用飞机秘密偷入我国东北领空进行间谍侦察活动时，被我击落后活捉十一人，摔死三人。另外，有一部分是由美国“中央情报局”及其所属的间谍机关，所谓“自由中国运动总部”直接派遣来的，有一部分是美国掌握下的蒋介石卖国集团的间谍机关派遣来的。不论是美国空投的或者是蒋介石卖国集团空投的特务，多数是蒋匪帮的军政人员、老牌特务以及土匪、恶霸等。他们有的是和蒋贼一起跑到台湾的，有的是在全国解放以后逃亡到香港、澳门等地，参加了美国的间谍机关，先后在日本的茅奇、塞班岛和台湾等地的美国间谍训练机构中受过所谓政治战、地下战、爆破战、游击战、通讯联络和空投跳伞等专门训练。美国侵略者及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团的间谍机关在选定空投的地区和制定空投计划以后，就在他们中间选择一些熟悉空投地区的地形并有旧反动关系的当地人，把他们编成小组，用美国飞机把他们空投在山区、湖泊或者省和省、县和县交界的人烟稀少的地区。在这里陈列着这些美国特务犯罪活动的各种证据，除各种枪枝弹药以外，有唐奈、费克图案的美国间谍特务使用的在华盛顿印制的我东北地区的军用地图，有空投目标河南光山易家店等地的地图，有被我击落的专供特务活动使用的美国飞机残骸的照片，有美国特务张载文等发给美国间谍机关的情报底稿，有美国特务在台湾淡水蒋贼“国防部游击干部训练班空投联络队”受训时的笔记的摘录，其中记载着特务们空投着陆以后应搜集的军事情报的提纲。在这里陈列着的还有标着“台湾印制厂”印制的所谓“苏皖边区人民反共突击纵队司令部”的委任令，有蒋贼保密局特务头子毛人凤给一个空投特务的所谓委任令和匪特们带来的蒋贼伪国防部的信笺，有匪特们伪造的各种证明文件和伪造证明文件的用具，有专供特务活动使用的各种美制收发报机、报话两用机、手摇发电机、空中测量器、电报密码、通报说明书、密写药剂以及手套手枪和钢笔电筒等罪证。此外还有专供特务求生和活动用的各种器具和物资。如帐篷、铁锹、锉子、镰刀、柴刀、渔具、药品、针线以及各种罐头食物和炊事用具。这里还摆着一部领航台，它是唐奈、费克图案中的美国特务“文队”带来的。一九五二年八月唐奈乘用飞机偷入我国吉林省上空为“文队”空投粮食等物资时，就是经过这部领航台和特务们取得联系的。美国间谍阿诺德和唐奈等人所乘用的飞机的残骸也陈列在这里。在展览室的另一处的墙壁上挂着阿诺德的亲笔供词，他供认“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”是由美国中央情报局通过“五八一”空军系统直接掌握，用来对中国和苏联的远东滨海地区进行特务活动的一个联队。在展览室外的院子里的一个高大的架子上，挂着各种颜色的大小降落伞。展览会的工作人员告诉我，降落伞上所以染着不同的颜色，是为了使匪特们空投着陆时不易被发现。例如要把特务空投在雪地上，一般都是用白色的降落伞，要把特务空投在山野森林地带就用绿色的降落伞。在展览室里还陈列着一个美国间谍机关专门用来从空中取走特务分子的器具，它是唐奈和费克图乘用飞机偷入东北领空被我击落后缴获的。
    从上述美国空投特务的各种罪证中，可以明显地看出美国侵略者为了在我国进行空投特务的罪恶活动是曾经花费过很多心思的。每一批美国空投特务都尽量巧妙地把自己伪装起来，早在他们离开日本、台湾以前就伪造了各种证明文件，在空投的时候又随身携带了各种伪造证明文件的用具。例如在展览室的一个玻璃柜里就陈列者唐奈、费克图案的美国空投特务伪造的我人民解放军的符号、护照、负伤纪念证、安东国境检疫证，还有刻图章用的刀子、木头、印泥和毛笔等物；在另一个地方陈列着空投在安徽地区的马匪新灿等伪造的上海市公安局的通行证，美国特务伪造的中国人民志愿军的服装。但是尽管这样，美国侵略者也知道它空投下来的特务要想在我国境内活动是很困难的，因此就为他们准备了各种生活和求生使用的器具和物品，从搭帐篷用的刀子、绳子、斧头、铁锹、铲子，一直到锅、瓢、碗、筷、鱼钩、鱼线、针线、药品和理发用具都带来了，甚至连面粉、猪油等物都空投下来了。美国侵略者满以为这样作，空投下来的特务们就能在山林地区生存下去，然后再乘机进行破坏活动。但是由于它的这种罪恶活动是反人民的，必然遭到我国人民的坚决反对，因而不管美国侵略者的用心是多么的阴险毒辣，也不管它想得多么周到，每一批特务空投下来以后都很快陷入了我国人民布下的天罗地网，他们的命运不是被活捉就是被当场击毙。在一个玻璃柜里陈列着一份电报底稿，它是唐奈、费克图案的美国特务“沈队”降落后发给美国间谍机关的，其中说到他们降落后的情况是“危险万分”。在我们的面前还有一张照片，它告诉我们当唐奈、费克图乘用的飞机被我击落后，当地的人民很快就得到了消息，民兵和群众立即出动，满山遍野搜捕美国间谍特务，终于迅速地把他们捉住了。在展览室的另一个地方，我还看见美国间谍机关给一批美国空投特务的指示，要他们注意收集我国的民情。应该告诉美国侵略者，这张照片上记载的事实以及许多地方的群众积极协助人民公安机关搜捕空投特务，就是我国民情的最重要的表现。如果美国侵略者不尊重我国的民情，而要顽固地继续它的卑鄙无耻的暗害破坏活动，那么不论特务匪徒是从陆地、海上或空中进入我国，他们的命运决不会比那些已经被活捉和被击毙的特务匪徒的命运好一些。
