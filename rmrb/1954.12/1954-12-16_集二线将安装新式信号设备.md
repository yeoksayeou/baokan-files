The Jining-Ulan Bator Railway will install new signal equipment – centralized mechanical and route control devices – on the entire line from Jining to Eren. For train operation blocking, a semi-automatic line blocking device will be adopted, which is the newest equipment on our country's railways. It enables adjacent stations to completely use electrical control signals when handling train receiving and dispatching procedures; drivers drive or stop based on signal displays, which can eliminate the procedure of drivers and station masters handing over train orders and tokens. This route control device has a station blocking control panel in the station master's office and a station blocking sub-panel in the switchman's room. Although the work positions of the station master and the switchman are far apart, due to mechanical control, the work pace can be consistent, which can completely avoid human errors caused by temporary mistakes in speech or hearing of the station master and the switchman, and can improve transportation efficiency.

This new type of signal equipment was designed by the Soviet Ministry of Transport with assistance to our country. The signal equipment for five stations, including Jining Hub Station, is also completely manufactured with Soviet assistance to our country. The signal equipment for other stations will be produced by the factory of the Communication Signal Engineering Company of the Ministry of Railways of our country; technical guidance will also be received from Soviet experts during installation.

Currently, the workers responsible for installing these signals are actively studying and researching the design documents with the help of Soviet experts. Preparations for replicating the equipment have already begun. In 1955, when the Jining-Ulan Bator Railway begins handling through transport, the signals from Jining to Eren within China will be fully installed.

    集二线将安装新式信号设备
    集宁—乌兰巴托铁路从集宁到二连全线将安装新式的信号设备——机械集中和进路控制装置。在行车闭塞方面，采用线路半自动闭塞装置，这在我国铁路上是最新式的设备。它能使相临两个车站，在办理接发列车手续时，完全利用电气控制信号；司机凭信号显示开车或停车，可以免掉司机与值班站长接递路笺、路牌的手续。这种进路控制装置，在值班站长室内设有站内闭塞总机，在扳道房设有站内闭塞分机。值班站长和扳道员的工作位置虽然距离很远，但由于机械的控制，工作步调可以取得一致，完全可避免值班站长和扳道员因言语、听觉的一时错误造成人为事故，并可提高运输效率。
    这种新型信号设备是苏联交通部帮助我国设计的，集宁枢纽站等五个车站的信号器材也完全是苏联帮助我国制造的，其他车站的信号器材将由我国铁道部通信信号工程公司工厂仿制；安装时，也将得到苏联专家的技术指导。
    现在，负责安装这些信号的职工，正在苏联专家帮助下，积极学习和研究设计文件。仿制器材的准备工作已经开始。一九五五年，当集宁—乌兰巴托铁路开始办理联运时，中国境内集宁到二连的信号就能全部安装好。
