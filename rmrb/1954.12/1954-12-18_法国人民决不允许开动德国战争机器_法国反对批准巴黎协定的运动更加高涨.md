Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 17th: As the date for the National Assembly's debate on the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements approaches, the movement among the French public against ratifying the Paris Agreements is intensifying.

    Honorary President of the National Assembly, Édouard Herriot, and others issued a declaration in Paris on the 15th, opposing the rearmament of Germany and the arms race.

    Former French Prime Minister and leader of the Radical Socialist Party, Édouard Daladier, said in the weekly "France Observateur" that he firmly believes the French people are currently as resolutely opposed to the Paris Agreements as they were to the establishment of the European Defense Community. Daladier pointed out that six million German workers, the vast majority of German youth, the entire Social Democratic Party, many Catholics, and members of the Lutheran Evangelical Church are all opposed to arming Germany, and strive to achieve the unification and freedom of their country through peaceful means and under peaceful conditions. Daladier called on France to choose between peaceful negotiations and armament, between respecting international agreements and undermining them, and between the unity and division of Europe.

    Deputy Deschamps of the Progressive Republican Union also firmly condemned the plan to remilitarize West Germany. He said, "Without France, it is impossible to establish any military alliance with an armed Germany participating." He advocated holding immediate negotiations to discuss—"the most important issue determining world peace."

    Deputy Philippe Barrès of the Social Republican Party condemned the ratification of the Paris Agreements, saying that it would have serious consequences and would result in the loss of opportunities for negotiations with the Soviet Union.

    Deputy Joseph Denais of the Independent Republican Party told a group of Parisian workers, "I voted against the 'European Defense Community' treaty, and I will also vote against the new agreements."

    Deputy Grimaud of the People's Republican Party assured a delegation of women from Grenoble that he opposed the agreement to arm Bonn Germany. Jean-Marie Louvel, a deputy of the People's Republican Party who previously supported the establishment of the "European Defense Community," declared when receiving a delegation of peace supporters from Caen, Calvados province, that he would vote against the Paris Agreements.

    Marcel Ribère (Independent Republican), Jean Groussau (former Gaullist), Paul Bacon (People's Republican), and several other deputies have all expressed opposition to ratifying the Paris Agreements.

    Three hundred university professors and lecturers issued a statement to the French people, saying: In order to consolidate world peace, it is necessary to strive for a negotiated solution to the German question, to prevent Germany from joining any military alliance, and to establish a security system for all European countries.

    François Billoux, a member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, delivered a speech at a mass rally in Paris on the 14th, commemorating the Communist Party members Gabriel Péri and Lucien Sampaix, who were killed by the Hitler occupiers. He said: The London and Paris Agreements are agreements between arms merchants. If these agreements are ratified, German militarism will be revived on the eastern border of France; France will participate in a military alliance against the Soviet Union—a country that has signed a treaty of mutual assistance and alliance with France. Billoux emphasized: Although the National Assembly will begin debating the ratification of these agreements in a few days, the French people can still prevent the German war machine from starting up.

    法国人民决不允许开动德国战争机器
    法国反对批准巴黎协定的运动更加高涨
      【新华社十七日讯】巴黎消息：随着国民议会辩论批准伦敦和巴黎协定问题的日期日益临近，法国公众反对批准巴黎协定的运动日益高涨。
    国民议会荣誉议长爱德华·赫里欧等人十五日在巴黎发表宣言，反对重新武装德国和军备竞赛。
    前法国总理、激进社会党领袖爱德华·达拉第在“法兰西观察家”周刊上说，他深信法国人民目前像上次反对建立欧洲防务集团一样坚决地反对巴黎协定。达拉第指出：六百万德国工人、绝大部分德国青年、整个社会民主党、许多天主教徒和信义福音会的会员，都反对武装德国，而力求通过和平方式并且在和平的条件下获得祖国的统一和自由。达拉第要求法国在和平谈判和武装之间，在尊重国际协定和破坏国际协定之间，在欧洲的团结和分裂之间，进行抉择。
    进步共和联盟议员德香布兰也坚决谴责西德重新军国主义化的计划。他说：“没有法国，就不可能建立任何有武装起来的德国参加的军事联盟。”他主张立刻举行谈判，讨论——“决定世界和平的最重大的问题”。
    社会共和党议员菲利普·巴雷斯谴责批准巴黎协定会造成严重的后果，而且会使得同苏联谈判的机会丧失。
    独立共和党议员约瑟夫·德纳对一批巴黎工人说：“我曾经投票反对‘欧洲防务集团’条约，我还要投票反对新的协定。”
    人民共和党议员格里莫向格累诺布妇女代表团担保反对武装波恩德国的协定。过去赞成建立“欧洲防务集团”的议员人民共和党让—马里·卢维尔在接见加尔瓦多省克恩城的和平拥护者代表团时声明，他将投票反对巴黎协定。
    马赛尔·里伯尔（独立共和党）、让·格鲁索（前戴高乐派）、保罗·培根（人民共和党）以及其他一些议员都表示反对批准巴黎协定。
    三百名高等学校教授和讲师发表告法国人民书说：为了巩固世界和平，必须争取以谈判解决德国问题，必须不使德国加入任何军事同盟，并且建立欧洲一切国家的安全体系。
    法国共产党政治局委员弗朗索瓦·皮佑在十四日在巴黎纪念被希特勒占领者杀害的共产党员加布里埃—佩里和卢森·桑培的群众集会上发表了演说。他说：伦敦和巴黎协定是军火商人间的协定。如果批准这些协定，德国军国主义就要在法国东部边境复活；法国就要参加到反对曾经同法国签订同盟互助条约的国家——苏联——的军事同盟里去。皮佑着重指出：虽然国民议会再过几天就要开始辩论批准这些协定的问题了，但是法国人民仍然可能制止开动德国战争机器。
