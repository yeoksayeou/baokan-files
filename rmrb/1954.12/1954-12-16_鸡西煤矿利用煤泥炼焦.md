Jixi Coal Mine Uses Coal Sludge to Produce Coke

Apart from producing fine powder for coking, the Didao Coal Washing Plant of the Jixi Mining Bureau had a portion of coal sludge (powder of crushed coal) that could have been utilized, but was washed away with water during the washing of raw coal. The amount of coal sludge washed away was staggering, about 200 tons per day, amounting to over 70,000 tons per year. After Soviet coal preparation expert Suraviev made a suggestion to the plant in April of this year to use coal sludge for coking, the plant immediately assigned the coking section to conduct experiments and built eleven large open-air sedimentation tanks, restoring 150 coking kilns. The experimental results were good, and the quality of the coke produced met the requirements. Under normal circumstances, 100 tons of coal sludge can produce about 60 tons of coke. Currently, more than 2,000 tons of coke are produced from coal sludge each month. After deducting processing costs, it can accumulate more than 400 million yuan for the country each month, and about 5 billion yuan for the country annually. Now, these cokes have been supplied in large quantities to state-owned machinery, agricultural implements, and sand casting factories in Harbin, Mudanjiang, and other places.

    鸡西煤矿利用煤泥炼焦
    鸡西煤矿矿务局滴道洗煤厂除了生产供炼焦用的精粉外，还有一部分本来可以利用的煤泥（碎煤的粉末）在洗原煤时都随水冲走了。冲走的煤泥数量非常惊人，每天有二百吨左右，每年就有七万吨以上。苏联选煤专家苏拉维耶夫今年四月向该厂提出利用煤泥炼焦的建议后，该厂即责成炼焦股负责进行试验，并修建了十一个大型露天沉淀池，恢复了一百五十台炼焦窑。试验结果良好，炼出的焦炭质量都能达到要求，一百吨煤泥在正常情况下可炼出焦炭六十吨左右。现在每月利用煤泥炼成焦炭二千余吨，除去加工成本外，每月可为国家积累资金四亿多元，全年可为国家积累资金约五十亿元。现在这些焦炭已大量供应哈尔滨、牡丹江等地地方国营机械农具、翻砂工厂。（本报黑龙江记者站）
