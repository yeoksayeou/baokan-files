Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 5th: Today, "Pravda" published a commentary signed "Observer" on the recently concluded treaty between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, titled "An Act of Provocation Against the Chinese People." The article states that the treaty between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek is an open provocation by the US ruling clique against the People's Republic of China. The purpose of this provocation is to undermine peace in the Far East and throughout Asia.

The article says that it is impossible not to note that the signing of the US-Chiang treaty coincides with the signing of the Paris Accords by the United States and its partners, reviving German militarism and incorporating it into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. In Asia, as in Europe, American imperialism is treading a dangerous path of provocation.

The article continues, stating that some clauses of the US-Chiang treaty are directly aimed at further intensifying aggressive activities in the Far East and stepping up subversive activities against the People's Republic of China. These clauses are tantamount to directly inciting the Kuomintang bandits to take new aggressive actions against the Chinese people.

The article says that it is enough to say that the US-Chiang treaty stipulates that the United States can interfere in China's internal affairs and prevent the liberation of Taiwan Island, which has been Chinese territory since ancient times, from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The article points out that the conclusion of the US-Kuomintang treaty and the attempt to occupy China's Taiwan Island and other territories belonging to China for a long time are acts of blatant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China and interference in China's internal affairs. "Observer" writes that this practice openly violates the United Nations Charter, which prohibits foreign interference in internal affairs. The liberation of Taiwan, which is occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, is the sovereignty of the Chinese people, and they will never allow anyone to interfere in the realization of this task.

The article then says that it is noteworthy that open calls for war against the People's Republic of China have become more frequent in the United States recently. The "New York Herald Tribune" reported a few days ago that a powerful group has emerged in the US ruling circles, which believes that it is necessary to prevent China from consolidating itself at all costs.

The article points out that the People's China is now a hundred times stronger, and it has shown its strength to the aggressors in action. The great camp of peace, democracy, and socialism is becoming stronger and stronger.

The article continues: The Chinese people, who are vigilantly watching the conspiracies of the American imperialists, angrily condemn the new American aggressive acts, which greatly complicate the situation in the Far East and endanger the peace and security of all peace-loving countries.

The article concludes by quoting Chinese newspapers' condemnation of American aggressive acts and says: The makers of the US-Chiang treaty should seriously consider these warnings.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 5th: Indian newspapers condemn the so-called "mutual defense treaty" signed between the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

The "National Herald" editorial on the 3rd attacked the treaty, saying that the conclusion of this treaty is a "plundering act" by the United States attempting to permanently illegally occupy Taiwan. The newspaper said: "Taiwan is an indivisible part of Chinese territory and is recognized by the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. It must be governed by the regime that firmly controls the mainland, and the US-Kuomintang security treaty effectively separates it from the Chinese mainland. This treaty has rendered the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation waste paper and marks open US interference in the Chinese civil war."

The editorial also pointed out that China's reaffirmation of its determination to liberate Taiwan is of great significance. The editorial wrote: "It is extremely absurd to insist that Taiwan is more important to the security of the United States, which is thousands of miles away, than to the security of the mainland, which is only a hundred miles across the sea."

The editorial finally believes that if anything can ease the tension in the Far East, it is to return Taiwan, which rightfully belongs to China, to China.

The "Free Press," published in Bombay on the 3rd, pointed out that this treaty will aggravate the tension in the Far East. This new action by the US government to encroach on Chinese territory "makes reaching any unanimously agreed solution to the Far East problem more difficult than ever before."

    苏联和印度报纸谴责美蒋条约
    认为它是美国统治集团对我国的公开挑衅
   【新华社莫斯科五日电】“真理报”今天刊载了署名“观察家”的一篇评论美国和蒋介石最近缔结的条约的文章，文章的题目是“对中国人民的挑衅行为”。文章写道，美国和蒋介石的条约是美国统治集团对中华人民共和国的公开挑衅。这个挑衅的目的是企图破坏远东和整个亚洲的和平。
    文章说，不能不注意到，美蒋条约的签订，正当美国及其伙伴签订复活德国军国主义并将它纳入北大西洋侵略集团的巴黎协定的时候。在亚洲，正如在欧洲一样，美国帝国主义正走着危险的挑衅道路。
    文章又说：美蒋条约中的一些条款是直接要进一步加紧在远东的侵略活动，并加紧对中华人民共和国的颠覆活动。这些条款等于是直接煽动国民党匪帮对中国人民采取新的侵略行动。
    文章说道，只说下面这一点就足够了，美蒋条约规定美国可以干涉中国内政，阻止解放蒋介石集团统治下的自古以来就是中国的领土的台湾岛。
    文章指出，美国—国民党条约的缔结和想长期占领中国的台湾岛以及其他属于中国的领土的企图是粗暴地侵犯中华人民共和国的主权和领土完整的行为，是干涉中国内政的行为。“观察家”写道，这种做法公然违背禁止外国干涉内政的联合国宪章。解放为蒋介石匪帮窃据的台湾是中国人民的主权，他们绝不容许任何人干涉这个任务的实现。
    文章接着说，值得注意的是，主张对中华人民共和国进行战争的公开叫嚣最近在美国更加频繁了。“纽约先驱论坛报”在几天前报道说，在美国统治集团中出现了一个有势力的集团，这个有势力的集团认为必须不惜任何代价不让中国巩固。
    文章指出，人民中国已经百倍强大，它已在行动中向侵略者表明了它的力量，伟大的和平民主和社会主义的阵营已经越来越强大了。
    文章接着说：警惕地注意着美帝国主义者的阴谋的中国人民愤怒地谴责美国的新的侵略行为，这种行为使远东局势大大地复杂起来，并危及和平和所有爱好和平国家的安全。
    文章最后引述了中国报纸对美国侵略行为的斥责后说：美蒋条约的制造者们应该严肃地想一想这些警告。
    【新华社新德里五日电】印度报纸谴责美国政府和蒋介石卖国集团之间签订的所谓“共同防御条约”。
    三日的“国民先驱报”社论抨击这个条约说：缔结这个条约是美国企图永久非法占领台湾的“剽窃行为”。这个报纸说：“台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分，并且是得到开罗宣言和波茨坦公告的承认的。它必须由稳固地控制着大陆的政权治理，而美国—国民党安全条约实际上把它从中国主体分离开来。这个条约已使开罗宣言和波茨坦公告成为废纸，并且标志着美国公开干涉中国内战。”
    社论还指出：中国重申解放台湾的决心，是有重大意义的。社论写道：“硬说台湾对在好几千英里以外的美国的安全，比对相隔仅一百英里海面的大陆的安全更属重要，这真是荒谬已极。”
    社论最后认为：如果有任何东西能够缓和远东紧张局势，那就是把理所应当属于中国的台湾归还给中国。
    孟买出版的“自由新闻”三日指出：这个条约将加剧远东的紧张局势。美国政府这一侵占中国领土的新行动“使远东问题达成任何一致同意的解决比以往更加困难”。
