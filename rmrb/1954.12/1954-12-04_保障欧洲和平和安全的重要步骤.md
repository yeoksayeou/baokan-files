The European countries’ conference on guaranteeing European peace and security, which began in Moscow on November 29, concluded victoriously on December 2. The conference unanimously adopted and signed a declaration by the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania. The declaration states that if Western countries ratify the Paris Agreements, which aim to revive German militarism and threaten the peace-loving countries of Europe, then the peace-loving countries of Europe need to take measures to ensure their own security. This important expression of European peace-loving countries is undoubtedly absolutely necessary to guarantee European peace and security.

The European countries’ conference on guaranteeing European peace and security was held because Western countries, disregarding the peace aspirations of the European people, are determined to revive West German militarism, drag armed West Germany into their military aggression bloc against European peace-loving countries, and put the peace-loving countries and people of Europe in the face of a serious threat of war. Therefore, when the Soviet Union initiated the convening of this conference, it was supported by the peace-loving countries of Europe and the vast number of peace-loving people in Europe. The facts of the two world wars prove that it is not only the people of the invaded countries who suffer the pain of war; the people of aggressor countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan also suffer heavy losses and great pain. It is obvious that the efforts made by the European countries' conference on guaranteeing European peace and security are not only steps taken by the participating countries to care for the security of their own countries, but also steps they have taken to guarantee the peace and security of the entire Europe.

It is known that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France refused to participate in the European conference and pressured other European countries not to participate either. Moreover, in their reply on November 29, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France openly expressed their determination to "bring the Paris Agreements into effect as soon as possible." They insisted that "there is no necessary basis for holding a useful conference at present, whether to discuss the German and Austrian questions or other aspects of European security." This excuse for refusing consultation is unfounded. The representatives of the participating countries in the European conference pointed out in their speeches that as long as Western countries abandon the policy of reviving German militarism, it is entirely possible for the countries concerned to reach an agreement on the German question and European security. The American aggressor bloc and its British and French partners insist on ratifying the Paris Agreements, which shows their determination to revive German militarism and their determination to worsen the situation in Europe.

This aggressive policy of Western countries has put European peace and security in the face of a serious threat. Everyone knows that once the London and Paris Agreements are implemented, West Germany will establish an army of 500,000 men (according to the secret agreement between Washington and Bonn, this army will be further expanded several times) and formally begin large-scale production of armaments; the rebuilt West German army will not only be led by the former generals of Hitler, but will also be allowed to possess all kinds of weapons, including atomic weapons. The implementation of this plan will not only create new obstacles to the peaceful settlement of the German question, but will also turn West Germany into a new hotbed of war. Historical experience has repeatedly proved that as long as German militarism is allowed to revive and allowed to rebuild its armed forces, it will seriously aggravate the European situation and deepen the danger of a new war in Europe. The people of European countries who have suffered from the disasters of German militarism have had painful lessons in this regard, and no argument can convince them that the revival of German militarism will not deepen the danger of a new war in Europe.

It is very clear that the peace-loving European countries cannot ignore the plan of Western countries headed by the United States to revive German militarism and prepare for a new war in Europe. In order to prevent the re-aggression of German militarism and the threat of a new war, the countries participating in the Moscow European Conference declared in the declaration: "They are determined to take joint measures in the organization of armed forces and command, and also to take other measures necessary to strengthen their national defense, to ensure the peaceful labor of their people, to guarantee the inviolability of their borders, and to ensure the repulse of possible aggression, if the Paris Agreements are ratified after all." This decision of the peace-loving countries of Europe is obviously very necessary. The painful lessons of the past two world wars show that it would be a serious mistake if the consequences of the revival of German militarism are not fully estimated and forceful preventive measures are not taken. The tragedy of Munich must never be allowed to be repeated; the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other peace-loving European countries must not be allowed to suffer further from the aggression of German revanchist forces. The people of Europe and the world who love peace clearly realize that the measures taken by the peace-loving countries of Europe to ensure security in order to prevent the German Wehrmacht from pushing Europe and the world into a new war not only conform to the interests of the peace-loving countries themselves, but also have great significance for ensuring the security of Europe and the world. This important decision that the peace-loving countries of Europe are preparing to take to guarantee European peace will undoubtedly have a huge encouraging and promoting effect on the just struggle of the people of European countries against the re-militarization of West Germany and against the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

The declaration of the European Conference pointed out that the countries participating in the conference will continue to adhere to the proposition of establishing a European collective security system, believing that it is necessary to first abandon the plan to re-militarize West Germany and make West Germany join the military bloc, and it is necessary to reach an agreement on holding free German elections throughout Germany in 1955 and establishing a unified, democratic, and peaceful German government throughout Germany on this basis. As the declaration pointed out, the withdrawal of occupation forces from East and West Germany according to the Soviet proposal would greatly help the rapprochement of the two parts of Germany and help the completion of the task of reunifying Germany.

The struggle of the people of European countries and the peace forces of the world to strive for European peace has now reached a new stage of decisive significance; the result of this struggle will have a major impact on the cause of peace in Europe and the world.

The outcome of the European Conference once again clearly proves that the attempt of the United States and its followers, Britain and France, to impose the "accomplished fact" of reviving German militarism on the peace-loving countries of Europe and to treat them with the so-called "policy of strength" will not work. The Soviet Union and the European people's democratic countries have the strength and determination to safeguard their own security. If Western countries continue to implement the policy of leading Europe to war regardless of everything, they must bear full responsibility for this and will inevitably suffer the consequences.

The Chinese people fully support the declaration of the eight governments participating in the European countries conference. The Chinese people are not only determined and powerful enough to defend the security of their motherland and maintain peace in Asia, but will also never sit idly by and watch the peace-loving countries and people of Europe suffer aggression. The united strength of peace-loving countries and people is invincible, and victory belongs to peace-loving countries and people.

### 保障欧洲和平和安全的重要步骤

    保障欧洲和平和安全的重要步骤
    十一月二十九日在莫斯科开始举行的欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议，在十二月二日胜利结束了。会议一致通过并由苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚签订了宣言。宣言认为：如果西方国家批准了以复活德国军国主义为目的的巴黎协定，使欧洲的爱好和平国家遭受到战争威胁，那么欧洲的爱好和平国家需要采取措施以保障自己的安全。欧洲爱好和平国家的这一重大表示，为了保障欧洲和平和安全无疑是绝对必要的。
    欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议的举行，是由于西方国家不顾欧洲人民的和平愿望，决心要复活西德军国主义，把武装起来的西德拉进它们的反对欧洲爱好和平国家的军事侵略集团，使欧洲爱好和平的国家和人民面临着战争的严重威胁。因此，当苏联发起召开这个会议时，便得到了欧洲各爱好和平国家和欧洲各国广大爱好和平人民的拥护和支持。两次世界大战的事实证明，遭受战争的痛苦的，决不只是被侵略国家的人民；侵略国家如德国、意大利、日本的人民，同样受到惨重的损失和极大的痛苦。显而易见，欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议所作的努力，不仅是与会国家关怀他们自己国家的安全的步骤，也是它们为了保障整个欧洲的和平和安全的步骤。
    人们知道：美、英、法三国政府拒绝参加欧洲会议，并且压迫其他欧洲国家也不要参加。不仅如此，美、英、法三国政府在十一月二十九日的复照中并公然表示决心要“尽可能快地使巴黎协定生效”。它们硬说“不论是讨论德国、奥地利问题还是欧洲安全的其他方面，目前不存在必要的基础来举行一个有用的会议。”这种拒绝协商的借口是毫无根据的。参加欧洲会议的各国代表在发言中就曾指出，只要西方国家放弃复活德国军国主义的政策，有关各国就德国问题和欧洲安全问题达成协议是完全有可能的。美国侵略集团及其英、法伙伴们坚持要批准巴黎协定，这就表明它们决心要复活德国军国主义，死心塌地要使欧洲的局势恶化。
    西方国家的这种侵略政策已使得欧洲的和平和安全面临着严重的威胁。谁都知道，伦敦和巴黎协定一旦实施，西德就将建立起一支五十万人的军队（根据华盛顿与波恩的密约，这支军队将进一步扩大到好几倍），并正式开始大规模生产军火；重建起来的西德军队，不仅由过去希特勒的将领来统率，而且被准许拥有包括原子武器在内的一切种类的武器。这种计划的实施，不仅将为和平解决德国问题造成新的障碍，而且将把西德变成为新的战争温床。历史经验已经一再证明，只要听任德国军国主义复活并让它重建武装力量，它将使欧洲局势严重起来，并加深欧洲新战争的危险。饱受德国军国主义灾害的欧洲各国人民对此有过惨痛的教训，没有任何论据可以使他们相信，德国军国主义复活并不会加深欧洲新战争的危险。
    事情很明显，爱好和平的欧洲国家对于以美国为首的西方国家复活德国军国主义、在欧洲准备新战争的计划是不能置之不理的。为了防止德国军国主义的重行侵略和进行新战争的威胁，参加莫斯科欧洲会议的国家在宣言中宣布：“它们具有决心在巴黎协定竟然批准时在组织武装力量和司令部方面采取共同措施，并且还要采取加强它们国防力量所必需的其他措施，以保障它们人民的和平劳动，保证它们国境的不可侵犯性，保证击退可能发生的侵略。”欧洲爱好和平的国家的这种决定显然是十分必要的。过去两次世界大战的惨痛教训说明，如果对复活德国军国主义的后果不作充分的估计，并采取有力的预防措施，将是一种严重的错误。慕尼黑的悲剧是绝不容许重演的；苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克以及其他爱好和平的欧洲国家是不容再遭受德国复仇主义势力的侵犯的。欧洲以及全世界爱好和平的人民都清楚地认识到，欧洲爱好和平的国家为防止德国国防军把欧洲和全世界推进一次新的战火中去而采取保障安全的措施，不但符合于爱好和平国家的本身的利益，并且对于保障欧洲以及全世界的安全也有着重大的意义。欧洲爱好和平的国家为了保障欧洲和平而准备采取的这一重大决定，无疑地对于欧洲各国人民反对西德重新军国主义化和反对批准巴黎协定的正义斗争，将发生巨大的鼓舞和推动作用。
    欧洲会议的宣言指出，参加会议的国家将继续坚持为建立欧洲集体安全体系的主张，认为必须首先放弃使西德重新军国主义化并且使西德参加军事集团的计划，必须就一九五五年举行全德自由选举、并在这个基础上成立统一的、民主的、和平的德国的全德政府取得协议，正如宣言所指出的，根据苏联的建议从东德和西德境内撤退占领军，在很大程度上会有助于德国两个部分的接近，会有助于重新统一德国的任务的完成。
    欧洲各国人民和全世界的和平力量争取欧洲和平的斗争，现在已到了具有决定意义的新阶段；这个斗争的结果对于欧洲和全世界的和平事业将有重大的影响。
    欧洲会议的结果再一次清楚地证明，美国及英法追随者企图把复活德国军国主义的“既成事实”强加在欧洲爱好和平国家的身上，并用所谓“实力政策”来对待它们，是行不通的。苏联和欧洲人民民主国家有力量、有决心来维护自己的安全。如果西方国家依然不顾一切地执行把欧洲导向战争的政策，它们就必须对此负完全的责任，并不可避免地将要自食恶果。
    中国人民完全支持参加欧洲国家会议的八国政府的宣言。中国人民不仅有决心、有力量保卫自己祖国的安全，维护亚洲的和平，而且也绝不坐视欧洲爱好和平的国家和人民横遭侵略。爱好和平的国家和人民团结一致的力量是无敌的，胜利是属于爱好和平的国家和人民的。
