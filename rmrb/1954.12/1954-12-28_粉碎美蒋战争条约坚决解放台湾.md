Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 26th: People in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City are working hard to produce and support the liberation of Taiwan.

More than 1,700 representatives from all walks of life in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City held a rally on the 25th to oppose the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The representatives attending the meeting unanimously expressed their determination: No matter what obstacles, we must liberate Taiwan.

Wu Xian, member of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and secretary of the Hangzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report at the meeting. He said: We resolutely oppose the US-Chiang treaty, and no one can stop our determination to liberate Taiwan. Zhejiang Province is located on the front line of national defense, and we shoulder a particularly glorious responsibility in the struggle to liberate Taiwan. Farmers throughout the province must work hard to improve agricultural production, produce more industrial raw materials and food, and supply the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country; workers and people from all walks of life in the province must increase production, practice thrift, accumulate funds, and do a good job in supplying the front line. Wherever the troops go, we will supply them; whatever the troops need, we will supply them. The people of the province must also make various preparations for the struggle against the enemy, and crush the enemy's aggressive conspiracies and various sabotage activities.

Jiang Zhenzhong, chairman of the preparatory committee of the Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the China Democratic League, said at the meeting: "We will never forget the persecution and brutal killings of members of democratic parties during the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement. The Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan cannot be shaken by any obstruction." Chen Yousheng, a national railway labor model and deputy section chief of the Zhakou Locomotive Depot of the Hangzhou Branch of the Shanghai Railway Administration, said at the meeting: Our railway workers guarantee to do a good job in transportation, safely and quickly transport materials to the coastal defense front line, and support the liberation of Taiwan. Shen Liujin, an agricultural labor model in Hangzhou, said at the meeting that he would enthusiastically pay agricultural taxes and sell surplus grain to the state in response to the barbaric aggression of US imperialism.

All the representatives unanimously passed a resolution to liberate Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 26th: People in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City are determined to intensify preparations for the liberation of Taiwan.

More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City proposed at a meeting held on the 25th to thoroughly crush the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" by intensifying preparations for the liberation of Taiwan.

The meeting was presided over by Chen Rutang, vice chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Consultative Committee. He said: We are holding this meeting to express our full support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement, resolutely oppose the US-Chiang war treaty, and liberate Taiwan. Gu Dacun, acting chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Consultative Committee, said in his speech: The US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is a thorough and complete treaty of aggression. No matter how the US aggressor group and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group use rhetoric to quibble, they cannot conceal the crimes of infringing upon our country's sovereignty, dividing our country's territory, and threatening peace in Asia and the world that are clearly exposed by this treaty. The 34 million people in our province must be vigilant, strengthen unity, overcome difficulties, do a good job, and use practical actions to express our firm determination to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

Zhang Luchun, vice chairman of the Guangdong Branch of the China Peace Committee, said: No matter how shamelessly the United States interferes, Taiwan is an inseparable territory of China, and we must liberate it. Yang Rongguo, a representative of the democratic parties, said: The members of our various democratic parties in Guangdong Province, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely use practical actions to crush this most shameless US-Chiang treaty. Yi Meihou, a representative of overseas Chinese and director of the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Friendship Association, pointed out: We overseas Chinese have suffered deeply from the scourge of Chiang bandits who openly plunder under the protection of US imperialism. We, the vast number of overseas Chinese and their families, resolutely oppose the US-Chiang treaty and must liberate Taiwan.

Workers, peasants, youth, women, students, business circles, and religious representatives who attended the meeting unanimously expressed that they would strengthen their work in all aspects together with the people of the whole country and actively support the liberation of Taiwan.

The conference finally passed a resolution. The resolution stated: We, the people of Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, together with the people of the whole country, will strengthen our strength in all aspects in the future, curb the arrogant ambitions of the US aggressor group, and strive to defend peace in Asia and the world and accelerate the completion of preparations for the liberation of Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 27th: Workers and peasants in Shandong Province are holding meetings to oppose the US-Chiang treaty.

In recent days, workers and peasants in Jinan, Qingdao, Zibo, Yantai and other cities in Shandong Province, as well as in the vast rural areas, have held various rallies to oppose the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" and support the liberation of Taiwan with various practical actions.

The Shandong Provincial Consultative Committee, the Shandong Branch of the China Peace Committee, local organizations of various democratic parties in Jinan, and various people's organizations have held various rallies from the 14th to the 23rd. At the recent Third Congress of the Jinan Municipal Members of the First National Machinery Trade Union of China, the representatives unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and passed a resolution calling on more than 40,000 machine workers and their families in the city to actively improve product quality, ensure the health of employees, and work hard to support the liberation of Taiwan.

Under the slogan of supporting the liberation of Taiwan, new production achievements are constantly emerging in various factories and mines. The freight car workshop of the Jinan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has completed its annual production plan 23 days ahead of schedule. The workers recently proposed to guarantee no absenteeism before and after the New Year and produce more freight cars to enhance the country's construction strength. The staff and workers of the state-owned Xinbo Coal Mine, on the basis of completing the annual production task 49 days ahead of schedule, put forward the task of increasing production by 28,000 tons of coal and digging 560 meters. Now a new labor upsurge has been set off in the entire mine.

In the vast rural areas, farmers are also supporting the liberation of Taiwan with their own actions. After holding a forum on "Supporting the Liberation of Taiwan," the Wang Deshu mutual aid group in Fengxi Village, Kunyu County, has sold more than 4,000 kilograms of surplus grain and peanuts to the state. The Zangjiatun Agricultural Production Cooperative in the second district of Jinan City, where Shandong Provincial Agricultural Labor Model Li Zhendong is located, produced an average of 570 kilograms of grain per mu this year; now all the members of the cooperative unanimously propose to tap the potential for increased production, so that the output in 1955 will increase by 30% compared with this year, in order to support the liberation of Taiwan.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 26th: The broad masses of people in Shenyang oppose the United States taking the old path of Japanese aggression against our country.

More than 1,500 representatives from all walks of life in Shenyang gathered on the morning of the 25th to sternly condemn the US-Chiang treaty and oppose US imperialism taking the old path of Japanese aggression against China. The conference unanimously passed a resolution. The resolution stated that the people of Shenyang clearly remember the lessons of the "September 18th" incident launched by Japanese imperialists in Shenyang in 1931! For the sake of peace, we must not beg for peace at the cost of our territory. Only by uniting more closely with the people of the whole country, and taking practical actions in our respective work posts to support the liberation of Taiwan and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, can we safeguard our country's security and peace in Asia and the world.

Jiao Ruoyu, secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report at the meeting. He exposed the aggressive nature of the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" and condemned the US government's war provocations against our people. He said: We must learn from history. In 1931, Japanese militarists launched the "September 18th" incident in Shenyang, which then led to the Lugouqiao Incident in 1937, and finally launched the Pacific War. The people of Shenyang still have fresh memories of the disasters brought about by the "September 18th" incident. US imperialism is taking the old road of Japanese militarism and signed the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" in an attempt to legalize its occupation of Taiwan. This is something we resolutely oppose, and we must prevent the re-emergence of a new Lugouqiao Incident. Finally, he said: "People from all walks of life in Shenyang must unite more closely, be of one heart and one mind, and fight for the elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group and for the liberation of Taiwan."

Subsequently, representatives from the local organizations of various democratic parties in Shenyang, various people's organizations, workers, peasants, cultural and educational circles, ethnic minorities, religious circles, and others spoke at the meeting, unanimously condemning the US aggressors' war provocations against our people in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, and expressing their determination to strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, do a good job in all aspects, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Wang Wenshan, an industrial labor model in Shenyang, said: "Our factory workers must further launch a labor competition with technological innovation as the main content and trial-produce more new products." Zhang Zhenfa, an agricultural labor model in Shenyang and director of the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative, said in his speech that he represented all members of the cooperative in resolutely supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement, and expressed that he would sell all 310,000 kilograms of surplus grain to the state to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.
