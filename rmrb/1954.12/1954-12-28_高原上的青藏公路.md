    The Qinghai-Tibet Highway, the section from Golmud to Lhasa, a distance of 1,280 kilometers, was completed in just seven months. The entire Qinghai-Tibet Highway, 2,100 kilometers long, starting from Xining and ending in Lhasa, is now open to traffic.

    The Qinghai-Tibet Highway is built on the vast grasslands more than 4,000 meters above sea level, along the southern shore of Qinghai Lake, China's largest inland lake, entering the rich Qaidam Basin, crossing the Kunlun Mountains to the south, bypassing the mountains west of the source of the Yellow River, crossing the uppermost reaches of the Yangtze River - the Chumar River and the Muru-Usu River, crossing the famous Tanggula Mountains, passing through the Qiangtang Grassland, along the southern shore of Tengger Lake, which is rich in borax, and entering the Lhasa River Plain.

    Qinghai and Tibet are closely connected, and the people of the two regions have close economic and religious ties, but the lack of a basic road in this desolate grassland has created many obstacles between the people of the two regions. For many years, travelers from Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Qinghai to Lhasa could only walk or ride cattle and horses, crossing mountains and rivers, taking at least several months. To build a road connecting Qinghai and Tibet, linking Tibet with the interior through the northwest of the motherland, is the long-cherished wish of the Chinese people, especially the Tibetan and Qinghai people.

    In 1951, when the Chinese People's Liberation Army marched into Tibet from the north, it was equipped with engineering and technical personnel who surveyed the route of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway along with the army. At that time, they walked through the vast swampy area in central Qinghai and failed to find an ideal route.

    From 1952 to 1953, several huge camel caravans continuously transported millions of pounds of flour from Qinghai to Heihe and Lhasa in Tibet. This attracted the attention of the leaders of the Tibet Transportation Corps. Several huge camel caravans came from Qinghai; such a large number of camels could not possibly advance in a single line. If camels could travel in groups of three or five from Qinghai, why couldn't a road be opened up on the path they traveled, allowing cars to pass?

    The Tibet Transportation Corps successively organized two large cart exploration teams, using rubber-wheeled carts and wooden-wheeled carts as wide as cars, each carrying more than 1,000 to 2,000 pounds of supplies, to explore the route along the path traveled by the camel caravans. The telegram sent back by the cart exploration team concluded with the exciting eight characters: "Mountains from afar, plains up close."

    Originally, although the Qinghai-Tibet area is full of mountains, the undulations are not significant, and the altitude is high with little difference in elevation. Only then did everyone deeply realize why people have always said "Qinghai-Tibet Plateau" instead of "Qinghai-Tibet Mountains," and only then did they believe that a uniquely endowed highway route had been found.

    However, building a road on the sparsely populated Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was not an easy task. Where would the people, road-building tools, and transportation tools come from? The central government allocated a batch of funds, a batch of iron picks, thousands of pounds of explosives, and a small number of cars and engineers to start the construction of this road. It was June at the time, and after the winter transportation, the fat camel humps had thinned down, and it was time for the annual "pasturing" season for the camels, and more than a thousand camel drivers were idle. The Tibet Transportation Corps organized the camel drivers to participate in road construction, solving the labor shortage.

    Starting from Golmud, the road advanced section by section, and the road-building army launched a heroic struggle against the snow-capped mountains, stone gorges, torrents, and desolate grasslands. The Kunlun Mountains, more than 4,700 meters above sea level, stood in front first. In the summer, the Kunlun Mountains often experience sudden rain and hail. Here, the road-building army split the steep cliffs on both sides of two large gullies eroded by snow water to a depth of dozens of meters and climbed to the top of the Kunlun Mountains, where the air is thin. When the road was being built on the Tanggula Mountains, strong winds and heavy snow made this highest mountain on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway dim and hazy. The road-building workers regarded participating in the project of opening up roads in places more than 5,000 meters above sea level in the motherland as the greatest honor. After twenty days of hard work, sometimes even working overnight by moonlight, the 30-kilometer project of the Tanggula Mountains was finally completed.

    On the Qingkang Highway, the Chumar River, the source of the Tongtian River, the Tuotuo River, the Ulan Moron River, and many other rivers blocked the way. To build a road, bridges must be built over these rivers. However, there was no steel or concrete here, and there was not a single piece of wood for hundreds of miles of grassland. How could bridges be built? At this time, the engineers and soldiers building the road remembered that during the war, they had learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and built countless water-crossing road surfaces, piling up stones from the bottom of the river, piling them over the water surface, allowing the army to pursue the remnants of the enemy. Now, why not build a water-crossing road surface? Therefore, the road-building workers wove willows into baskets, filled them with stones, piled them up layer by layer, and then laid stones on top, allowing the road to advance through the rivers.

    The Qinghai-Tibet Highway was built under the most difficult material conditions. Without tools, even the nails used to set up tents were taken out. Without a charcoal stove for repairing tools, cow dung was used to replace the fire. Iron picks and shovels were worn out countless times, and re-hammered countless times. In this way, they built the road to Lhasa.

    The central government, local governments, and the people have always cared about the construction of this road. As the construction gradually intensified, the central government allocated a large number of cars and engineering troops to support the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. The Tibetan people along the route organized support committees and yak teams to help the road builders transport materials.

    The entire Qinghai-Tibet Highway is now open to traffic. For centuries, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has been baring its broad chest. How many years have the natural conditions for building roads been available? But in all dynasties, who added a stone or a piece of wood there? Who hasn't used "mystery" to describe the transportation and geography of Qinghai-Tibet! In the great era of Mao Zedong, this "mystery" was finally unveiled by the Chinese people who worked hard to build the country. The highway passed through the boundless grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, closely linking Tibet, Qinghai, and the interior of the motherland.

    高原上的青藏公路
    牟余
    只用了七个月的时间，青藏公路格尔穆至拉萨，这段一千二百八十公里的路修成了。全长二千一百公里，起自西宁，迄于拉萨的青藏公路全线通车了。
    青藏公路修筑在拔海四千公尺以上的、广阔无际的大草原上，沿着我国最大的内陆湖——青海的南岸，进入富饶的柴达木盆地，南跨昆仑山，绕过黄河的发源地以西的丛山峻岭，横渡万里长江的最上游——楚玛尔河和穆鲁乌苏等河流，越过著名的唐古拉山，穿过羌塘草原，沿盛产硼砂的腾格里海南岸，进入拉萨河平原。
    青海和西藏紧相毗连，两地的人民有着密切的经济上和宗教上的往来，但这荒漠的草地上，缺少一条起码的公路，在两地的人民之间划下了重重险阻。多少年来，从内蒙古，从甘肃，从青海去到拉萨的旅客只能步行或乘骑牛马行路，翻山涉水，少不了几个月的时间。修筑一条贯通青藏的公路，把西藏经由祖国的西北，和内地连结起来，是我国人民，特别是西藏和青海各族人民的宿愿。
    一九五一年，由北路出发的中国人民解放军进藏时，就配备了工程技术人员，随军踏勘青藏公路的线路。当时，他们走过青海中部广大的泥沼地带，没有能找出一条理想的线路。
    从一九五二年到一九五三年，有好几支巨大的骆驼队接连不断地把数百万斤面粉，从青海运到西藏的黑河和拉萨。这件事，引起了西藏运输总队领导上的注意。几支巨大的骆驼队从青海过来了，这样多的骆驼，自然不可能排成一线前进；只要骆驼是三五成行地从青海走来，为什么不能在它们行走的路上开辟出一条公路，让汽车通行呢？
    西藏运输总队先后组织了两个大车勘探队，用和汽车一样宽的胶轮大车和木轮大车，各载一千多斤至两千多斤物资，沿着骆驼队行走的道路探测线路。大车勘探队拍回的电报，对这条线路的结论是令人兴奋的八个字：远看是山，近走是川。
    原来，青藏一带虽是群山叠叠，但起伏不大，海拔高而落差小。这时，大家才深深体会到，为什么历来人们只说“青藏高原”，而不说“青藏高山”的道理，才相信一条得天独厚的公路线已经找到了。
    但要在人烟稀少的青藏高原上修筑一条公路，不是一件容易的事。人、筑路工具、运输工具从那里来？中央拨给一批资金，调拨了一批铁镐，几千斤炸药，少数汽车和工兵，开始了这条公路的建设。当时正是六月，骆驼队经过冬季运输，肥壮的驼峰消瘦下去，又该是一年一度牧放骆驼的“放场”季节了，有一千多名驼员闲了下来。西藏运输总队就把驼员们组织起来，参加筑路，解决了人力的困难。
    从格尔穆开始，公路节节向前推进，筑路大军向雪山，石峡，激流和荒漠的草原展开了英勇的斗争。拔海四千七百多公尺的昆仑山首先横在面前。夏天的昆仑山时有骤雨冰雹，筑路大军在这里，劈开了两道被雪水冲刷成几十公尺深的大沟两岸坚硬的陡崖，登上空气稀薄的昆仑山顶。当公路修到唐古拉山时，大风大雪把这青藏公路上最高的一座山刮得一片昏暗迷茫，筑路员工都把能参加在祖国五千公尺以上的地方上开辟公路的工程，当作最大的光荣，经过二十天的艰苦奋斗，有时还借着月光连夜施工，唐古拉山三十公里的工程终于完成了。
    在青康公路上，有通天河的上游支流楚玛尔河、套套河、乌兰木伦河及其他许多河流，挡住去路。修筑公路，必须在这些河流上架起桥梁。可是，这里既没有钢材，也没有混凝土，草地数百里连一根木材都没有，怎能架桥？这时，筑路的工兵们想起了战争的时候，曾学习苏联先进经验，修筑过无数次过水路面，把石块从河底垒起，垒过了水面，让大军追击残敌。现在，为什么不修筑过水路面呢？于是，筑路员工把柳条编成篓子，装上石头，层层高垒，再在上面铺上石块，让公路通过一条条的河流向前挺进。
    青藏公路是在最困难的物质条件下修筑的。没有工具，搭帐篷用的钉子都拿出来了，没有修理工具的炭炉，就用牛粪烧火来代替。铁镐圆锹不知磨秃了多少次，不知重新锤打了多少回，就这样，他们把公路修到了拉萨。
    中央、当地政府和人民始终关怀着这条公路的建设。施工逐渐紧张时，中央又调拨了大批汽车和工兵部队去支援青藏公路的建设。沿线的藏族人民纷纷组织支援委员会和牦牛队，帮助筑路人员运送物资。
    青藏公路全线通车了。多少世纪以来，青藏高原一直袒露着它的宽广的胸怀。修筑公路的自然条件空有了多少年头？但历朝历代的青藏高原，有谁在那里添上一石一木？有谁不是用“谜”来形容青藏的交通、青藏的地理！到了伟大的毛泽东时代，这个“谜”终于被发奋建设的中国人民揭开了，公路穿过了青藏高原荒漠无边的草地，把西藏、青海和祖国的内地紧紧地联系起来了。
