Strengthening Security Work in the Agricultural Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement

    With the rapid development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the class struggle in rural areas is also becoming increasingly acute and complex. Those staunch counter-revolutionaries and those who resolutely resist socialist transformation, remnants of the classes that have been eliminated and are about to be eliminated, are doing everything possible to undermine the mutual aid and cooperation movement, especially agricultural production cooperatives. Seeing that their hopes of restoration are becoming increasingly dim due to the rapid development of the agricultural cooperation movement, they are driven to madness by every development in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. They spare no despicable means in an attempt to obstruct the development of agricultural production cooperatives, preventing our country's agricultural productive forces from being liberated from the shackles of capitalism and the limitations of small-scale production. The malicious intention of these counter-revolutionaries and stubborn elements of the hostile classes is to detach agriculture from the leadership of socialist industry, to detach peasants from the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class, to undermine the foundation of our people's democratic dictatorship—the worker-peasant alliance—and to prepare conditions for the restoration activities of U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
    Recent incidents of sabotage of agricultural production cooperatives in some areas further warn us that those counter-revolutionaries and stubborn elements of the hostile classes spread reactionary rumors such as "the grain harvested by cooperative members will all be turned over to the public," causing peasants to misunderstand the mutual aid and cooperation policies of our Party and the People's Government; or they try to provoke mutual suspicion and discord between cooperative members and cadres, between middle-peasant cooperative members and poor-peasant cooperative members, and between cooperative members with labor power and those without labor power; or they exaggerate certain shortcomings in the work of the cooperative to make peasants doubt the leadership of the cooperative and lose confidence in the future of running the cooperative. Some secretly sabotage the public-owned farm tools and water conservancy facilities of the cooperative, burn grain and fodder, harm livestock within the cooperative, assassinate cadres and activists, and create chaos and terror, in an attempt to scare peasants away. In Changli County, Hebei Province, one cooperative broke up due to the instigation of a rich peasant element. In other areas, some cooperatives have caused depression and confusion due to livestock being harmed, crops or warehouses being burned, and even personnel being murdered, which has increased the concerns of some peasants who originally wanted to join the cooperative.
    These enemies not only carry out sabotage outside the cooperatives, but some also disguise themselves as active supporters of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. They take advantage of the opportunity of the rapid development of cooperatives to infiltrate the cooperatives, deceive the trust of cooperative members and higher-level leaders, usurp the leadership of the cooperative, occupy important positions in the cooperative, and then adopt internal dismantling methods to carry out planned sabotage activities. For example, they exclude Party members, Youth League members, and poor peasant activists, win over and buy off ideologically backward elements, create internal discord, and try to make the cooperative deteriorate; or they deliberately destroy the cooperative's production management system, making various accounts chaotic, or deliberately sabotage the experimental promotion of new farm tools and new farming methods, making production unsuccessful and the distribution of income unreasonable, in order to attack the peasants' enthusiasm for running the cooperative, and try to finally bring down the cooperative.
    These situations show that the movement to consolidate and develop agricultural production cooperatives not only involves the struggle between general advanced and backward ideas, but also the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. This struggle is very acute, complex, and arduous. Whoever does not have a sufficient understanding of this struggle will make great mistakes. However, many rural work comrades do not pay attention to these sabotage activities because they are individual, and do not pay attention to universally strengthening the political work and security work of the cooperatives, and do not strictly implement the Party and government's policy of relying on poor peasants (including new middle peasants who were originally poor peasants), solidly uniting with middle peasants, and restricting and gradually eliminating rich peasants. They do not conduct serious reviews of the personnel who join the cooperative. There are also a small number of rural workers with vague positions who even admire rich peasants for being "strong, with strong horses and many farm tools, able to write and calculate, and good at management," and deliberately absorb rich peasants into the cooperative while adopting an attitude of exclusion towards poor peasants. Some rural work comrades do not seriously establish and improve supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives, tolerate the various capitalist activities of rich peasants and profiteers developing freely in rural areas, and sit idly by as capitalist ideas tempt and corrode the peasant masses. This is actually equivalent to condoning the counter-revolutionaries and stubborn elements of the hostile classes to obstruct and sabotage the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. In our public security organs and judicial organs, there are also many workers who do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of protecting the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. They believe that agricultural production is not economic construction, and that the sabotage incidents in rural areas are simple, and that a few households in a village can be named, so they rarely seriously investigate and study the new situation of rural class struggle and counter-revolutionary activities, and do not take timely measures to strengthen rural public security work. Their negligence and carelessness to a certain extent are also actually equivalent to condoning the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries and stubborn elements of the hostile classes against agricultural production cooperatives.
    In 1933, Comrade Stalin's words on how Soviet collective farms should prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionaries are also beneficial teachings for our country's current mutual aid and cooperation cadres and masses. Stalin said: "The organizational form of the collective farm not only does not eliminate the danger of anti-Soviet elements sneaking in, but even gives counter-revolutionaries a temporary opportunity to take advantage of in the first period. When peasants were still engaged in individual economy, they were scattered and separated from each other, so the counter-revolutionary conspiracies among the peasants by anti-Soviet elements could not have much effect. But after the peasants transitioned to the collective farm economy, the situation was completely different. Here, the peasants already have a ready-made mass organizational form, namely the collective farm. Therefore, anti-Soviet elements can achieve much greater results by sneaking into collective farms and engaging in anti-Soviet activities." Stalin pointed out that the organizational form of the collective farm is a weapon, "the whole question is in whose hands this weapon is, and against whom this weapon is used." Therefore, in our country's current situation, if agricultural production cooperatives are in the hands of the working class and the working peasants, we can realize the comprehensive collectivization of agriculture through this organizational form and lead all working peasants onto the road of socialism; conversely, if these organizations are in the hands of class enemies, they will become tools for the enemies to oppose the working class and the working peasants.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, Party organizations at all levels, especially grassroots Party organizations, must strengthen the political and ideological education of rural work cadres and peasant masses, and resolutely correct the erroneous idea of "burying oneself in production and construction and not asking about politics" that is currently growing among some cadres and masses. The work of establishing, expanding, and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives must be regarded as a very important class struggle, and constant struggle must be waged against counter-revolutionaries and stubborn elements of the hostile classes with a high degree of political vigilance. It is necessary to resolutely implement the Party's class line in rural work, strictly review the members participating in agricultural cooperatives, and not allow counter-revolutionaries and landlord and rich peasant elements to infiltrate, in order to purify the organization of production cooperatives and firmly grasp this weapon in the hands of the working peasants. While establishing and expanding agricultural production cooperatives, Party organizations at all levels must also lead peasants to develop supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives in a planned and step-by-step manner, in order to carry out a comprehensive struggle against the capitalist activities of rich peasants and profiteers in rural areas, and make socialism completely occupy the rural position. For the production cooperatives that have already been established, we must earnestly do a good job in consolidation work, help cooperative members establish and improve production management systems and accounting systems, and block various loopholes that can be used by the enemy.
    The county-level people's public security organs and judicial organs should regard the protection of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement as the focus of their work, promptly discover and crack down on the sabotage activities of various counter-revolutionaries and criminal offenders; assist the Party and government organizations in rural areas to establish and improve security and defense organizations within agricultural production cooperatives, gradually establish a security work system in production cooperatives, expose the sabotage behaviors of counter-revolutionaries and stubborn elements of the hostile classes; organize cooperative members and militiamen to carry out focused daily protection work, protect the safety of warehouses, livestock, farm tools, water conservancy facilities, and harvest season, and protect the smooth progress of agricultural production and the unified purchase and sale of grain and other major agricultural products. For reactionary rumors, once discovered, they must be immediately refuted and investigated; for sabotage incidents that occur in production cooperatives, whether they are political sabotage incidents or other sabotage incidents, they should be actively investigated and handled seriously, and should not be handled carelessly. For political sabotage incidents that have been solved, the people's courts should handle them quickly in accordance with the law, and should not delay or condone them, and should select major cases with typical educational significance, handle them in a high-profile manner, and use these specific examples to improve the political vigilance of the peasant masses, so as to ensure that the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement develops on a larger scale.

### 在农业互助合作运动中加强保卫工作

    在农业互助合作运动中加强保卫工作
    随着农业互助合作运动的迅速发展，农村中的阶级斗争也日益尖锐和复杂起来了。那些已经被消灭和即将被消灭的阶级中的残余的坚决反革命分子和坚决抵抗社会主义改造的分子，正在千方百计地破坏互助合作运动，特别是破坏农业生产合作社。他们看到由于农业合作运动的迅速发展，他们复辟的希望越来越暗淡了；因此，互助合作运动的每一发展，都引起他们疯狂般的仇恨。他们就不惜采取一切卑鄙无耻的手段，企图阻挠农业生产合作社的发展，使我国的农业生产力不能从资本主义的束缚下和小生产的限制下面解放出来。这些反革命分子和敌对阶级中的顽固分子的恶毒用心，就是要使农业脱离社会主义工业的领导，使农民脱离共产党和工人阶级的领导，破坏我国人民民主专政的基础——工农联盟，为美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团的复辟活动准备条件。
    最近有些地方出现的破坏农业生产合作社的事件更加警告了我们，那些反革命分子和敌对阶级中的顽固分子散播“社员打下粮食都要归公”之类的反动谣言，使农民误解我们党和人民政府的互助合作政策，或者在社员和干部之间，在中农社员和贫农社员之间，在有劳力社员和无劳力社员之间，设法挑起互相猜疑和不睦；或者把社内工作上的某些缺点夸大起来，使农民怀疑社的领导，对办社的前途丧失信心。有的则暗中破坏社内的公有农具和水利设备，焚烧粮食草料，暗害社内的牲畜，谋杀干部和积极分子，制造混乱和恐怖，想以此吓退农民。河北省昌黎县有一个社就因为富农分子的挑拨而散伙。其他地区有的社因牲畜被暗害、庄稼或仓库被火烧，甚至人员被谋害而引起沮丧和混乱，有些原来想入社的农民也因此增加了顾虑。
    这些敌人不仅在社外进行破坏，有的还把自己伪装成互助合作运动的积极拥护者，利用合作社大发展的机会，混入社内，骗取社员和上级领导人员的信任，窃取社的领导权，盘踞社的重要职位，然后采取内部拆台的办法，有计划地进行破坏活动。如排挤党、团员和贫农积极分子，拉拢和收买思想落后的分子，制造内部不和，企图使社变质；或者故意破坏社内的生产管理制度，把各种账目弄得紊乱不堪，或者故意破坏新式农具和新农作法的试验推广工作，使生产搞不好，收益分配不合理，借以打击农民的办社热情，企图最后把社拖垮。
    这些情况说明，在巩固和发展农业生产合作社的运动中，不仅包含着一般先进思想和落后思想的斗争，而且包含着革命和反革命的斗争，这种斗争是十分尖锐复杂而且艰苦的。谁如果对这种斗争认识不足，谁就要犯很大的错误。可是有不少农村工作同志因为这些破坏活动是个别的，就不加重视，不注意普遍加强合作社的政治工作和保卫工作，不严格执行党和政府所规定的依靠贫农（包括原为贫农的新中农）、巩固地团结中农、限制和逐步地消灭富农的政策，对于入社的人员不作认真审查。还有少数立场模糊的农村工作人员甚至羡慕富农“人强马壮农具多，能写会算经营好”，故意吸收富农入社，而对贫农采取排斥的态度。还有的农村工作同志不认真建立和健全供销合作社和信用合作社，容忍富农和奸商的种种资本主义活动在农村自由发展，坐视资本主义思想引诱和腐蚀农民群众，这就实际等于放纵了反革命分子和敌对阶级中的顽固分子阻挠和破坏农村互助合作运动。在我们的公安机关和司法机关中，也有不少工作人员对于保卫农业互助合作运动的重要性认识不足。他们认为农业生产不算经济建设，农村中的破坏事件情节简单，一个村庄有几家几户都能指名道姓，因而很少认真地调查研究农村阶级斗争和反革命活动的新情况，不及时采取措施去加强农村治安保卫工作。他们的这种疏忽大意，在一定程度上也实际等于放纵了反革命分子和敌对阶级中的顽固分子对农业生产合作社的破坏活动。
    一九三三年斯大林同志关于苏联集体农庄如何防止反革命分子的破坏所说的话，对于我国今天的互助合作的干部和群众也是有益的教导。斯大林说：“集体农庄这个组织形式不仅没有免除反苏维埃分子钻进来的危险，而且在第一个时期甚至使反革命分子有一种暂时加以利用的方便的机会。当农民还在进行个体经济时，他们是散居各处，彼此分立，因此反苏维埃分子在农民中间的反革命阴谋还不能发生多大的效果。而在农民过渡到了集体农庄经济以后，情形就完全不同了。这里农民已经有现成的群众组织形式，即集体农庄。因此反苏维埃分子钻进集体农庄和进行反苏维埃活动，也就能获得比较大得多的效果了。”斯大林指出集体农庄这个组织形式乃是一个武器，“全部问题是在于这个武器究竟握在谁手中，这个武器究竟是被利用去反对谁。”因此，照我国目前的情况来说，如果农业生产合作社是掌握在工人阶级和劳动农民的手中，我们就能够通过这个组织形式来实现农业的全面集体化，把全体劳动农民引上社会主义的道路；相反的，如果这些组织是掌握在阶级敌人的手中，它们就会变成敌人反对工人阶级和劳动农民的工具。
    为了保障农业互助合作运动的顺利进行，各地的党组织特别是党的基层组织，必须加强对于农村工作干部和农民群众的政治思想教育，坚决纠正目前正在部分干部和群众中间滋长着的“埋头生产建设，不问政治”的错误思想。必须把建立、扩大和巩固农业生产合作社的工作，当成一项十分重要的阶级斗争来看待，用高度的政治警惕性来和反革命分子和敌对阶级中的顽固分子进行经常的斗争。必须坚决贯彻执行党在农村工作中的阶级路线，严格审查参加农业合作社的成员，不让反革命分子和地主富农分子混入，才能纯洁生产合作社的组织，把这个武器牢牢地掌握在劳动农民的手中。在建立和扩大农业生产合作社的同时，各地的党组织还必须有计划有步骤地领导农民发展供销合作社和信用合作社，以便跟富农和奸商在农村中的资本主义活动作全面的斗争，使社会主义完全占领农村阵地。对于已经建立起来的生产合作社，则必须认真作好巩固工作，帮助社员建立和健全生产管理制度和会计制度，堵塞可以为敌人利用的各种漏洞。
    县级的人民公安机关和司法机关，应该把保卫农业生产互助合作运动当作自己工作的重点，及时地发现和打击各种反革命和刑事罪犯的破坏活动；协助农村的党政组织，在农业生产合作社内部，建立和健全治安保卫组织，逐步在生产合作社中建立起保卫工作制度，揭发反革命分子和敌对阶级中的顽固分子的破坏行为；组织社员和民兵有重点地进行日常的防护工作，保卫仓库、牲畜、农具、水利设施和收获季节的安全，保卫农业生产和粮食及其他主要农产品统购统销等项工作的顺利进行。对于反动的谣言，一经发现之后，就要立即驳斥和追查；对于生产合作社中发生的破坏事件，不论是政治性的破坏事件或其他破坏事件，都应该积极追查和严肃处理，不能马虎了事。对于已经破获的政治性破坏事件，人民法院应该依法迅速处理，不能拖延或宽纵，并且要选择有典型教育意义的重大案件，大张旗鼓地加以处理，用这些具体的事例来提高农民群众的政治警惕性，以保证农村互助合作运动更大规模地向前发展。
