Nading's Two Faces

Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations General Assembly has begun debating the U.S. spy case. This debate is being conducted by completely refusing to study the evidence of the crimes of American spies published by the Chinese government, and only listening to the American side of the story. In the chorus led by the United States demanding that China release American spies, the British representative, Nading, sang the most unpleasant tune.

Nading not only used words to support the United States, but also slapped the podium of the United Nations, putting on a very excited and慷慨 generous appearance. Of course, Nading didn't need to pound the table, if there was anything persuasive in his words.

The reason why the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China punished Arnold and eleven other U.S. Air Force personnel was because they trespassed into China's borders by plane to conduct espionage reconnaissance activities and attempted to provide supplies and contact American spies. Nading avoided talking about these facts, but talked about these spies wearing military uniforms, trying to prove in this way that these Americans were not spies but prisoners of war.

Of course, spies can wear all kinds of clothes, can wear American, British, or other countries' military uniforms, can also wear magnificent formal wear, and can also wear any clothes they want to wear; this is the freedom of spies. The Chinese government does not care what clothes they wear; as long as they intrude into Chinese airspace and carry out espionage activities, the Chinese government has the right to shoot down their planes and has the right to try and punish them. This is the simplest truth and the clearest provision in international law. Nading's attempt to defend the United States with such an irrelevant reason is obviously too weak, which makes him unable to help but pound the table to make himself seem justified.

Nading said that the reason why he wanted to "cry out loudly" to demand that China release the thirteen American spies was to prevent the Korean Armistice Agreement from being "destroyed or kicked away." It seems that Britain is very concerned about the inviolability of the Korean Armistice Agreement. But why hasn't anyone heard the British representative make any protests in the United Nations regarding the fact that the United States has violated the Korean Armistice Agreement and is still forcibly detaining more than 48,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war? These detained Korean and Chinese prisoners of war are now living miserable lives in the armies of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. Why don't those big men who talk about humanitarian principles on the UN podium say a fair word?

The British representative obviously has two completely different faces: he is silent about the crime of the United States kicking aside the Korean Armistice Agreement and forcibly detaining more than 48,000 prisoners of war, but he shouts and screams that the arrest of thirteen American spies violates the Korean Armistice Agreement. Regarding the reasons for this difference, perhaps, people can only use Nading's own words to explain it. Nading said that these American spies are "maintaining our cause, and I must maintain them." This sentence clearly explains the relationship between Britain and American espionage activities.

    纳丁的两副嘴脸
    新华社评论员　江南
    联合国大会已经在美国操纵之下开始了关于美国间谍案的辩论。这个辩论是在完全拒绝研究中国政府所公布的美国间谍的罪证、只听美国的一面之词的情况下进行的。在由美国领唱的要求中国释放美国间谍的大合唱中，英国代表纳丁唱出了最难听的调子。
    纳丁不但用话语来支持美国，而且用手拍打联合国的讲坛，做出一副十分激昂慷慨的样子。当然，纳丁完全可以用不着拍桌打凳，如果他的话语里面有着任何可以说服人的东西的话。
    中华人民共和国最高人民法院惩办阿诺德等十一名美国空军人员的理由，是他们乘用飞机偷越中国国境，进行间谍侦察活动，并企图进行接济和联络美国间谍分子。纳丁避开这些事实不谈，却谈到这些间谍穿的是军服，企图这样来证明这些美国人不是间谍而是战俘。
    当然，做间谍的可以穿各种各样的衣服，可以穿美国的、英国的或其他什么国家的军服，也可以穿冠冕堂皇的礼服，也还可以穿他愿意穿的任何衣服，这是作间谍的人的自由。中国政府不管他们穿什么衣服，只要他们侵入中国领空，进行间谍活动，中国政府就有权击落他们的飞机，有权把他们加以审判和治罪。这是最简单不过的道理。也是国际法中最明白的规定。纳丁想用这种牛头不对马嘴的理由来为美国辩护，显然是太没有力量了，这就使他不能不拍打桌子，来使自己似乎是理直气壮。
    纳丁说，他之所以要这样“大声疾呼”来要求中国释放十三名美国间谍，是为了使朝鲜停战协议不致被“破坏或一脚踢开”。看来，英国是很关心朝鲜停战协定的不受破坏的了。但是对于美国违反朝鲜停战协定，到现在还强迫扣留着四万八千多名朝中被俘人员的事实，为什么人们没有在联合国里听到英国代表有过任何抗议呢？这些被扣的朝中战俘，现在正在李承晚和蒋介石的军队中过着悲惨的生活，为什么那些在联合国讲坛上大谈人道原则的大人先生们一句公道话也不说呢？
    英国代表显然有着两副截然不同的嘴脸：他对于美国一脚踢开朝鲜停战协定、强迫扣留四万八千多名战俘的罪行一声不响，对于十三名美国间谍被捕却硬说是违反朝鲜停战协定而大叫大嚷。关于这种不同的个中原委，也许，人们只能用纳丁本人的话来作解释。纳丁说，这些美国间谍是“维护我们的事业的，我必须维护他们”。这句话倒相当清楚地说明了英国与美国间谍活动的关系。
