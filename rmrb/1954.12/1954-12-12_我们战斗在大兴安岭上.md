    We Fight on the Greater Khingan Range
    In the Greater Khingan Range forest region of northern China, tall Dahurian larches, Scotch pines, and snow-white, straight white birches grow everywhere, forming a sea of forests. These are all precious timbers indispensable to the country's economic construction.
    In order to make every piece of forest in the forest area serve the country's construction, and in order to make the forest grow and be managed reasonably, the Survey and Design Bureau of the Ministry of Forestry sent the first and second brigades, a total of more than 1,200 people, in May of this year, and marched into the Greater Khingan Range forest area to begin field forest surveys.
    In May, while it is the season when hundreds of flowers are in full bloom in southern China, and people are enjoying the brilliant and gorgeous scenery and the fresh fragrance of new leaves; in the desolate Greater Khingan Range, snowflakes are still flying and hailstones are falling, the mountains and plains are still covered with thick white snow, and the rivers are frozen like a mirror, filled with a bleak and severe winter atmosphere. Here, the young survey team members began their work. Sometimes they climb up and down mountains thousands of meters above sea level, sometimes they wander through thickets of poisonous and thorny shrubs, often without drinking water, eating a hot meal, or getting a good night's sleep...
    In summer, the forest area is particularly sultry, with continuous rain, and even on sunny days, it is densely covered with fog, and mosquitoes and small insects fly everywhere, biting the body and causing a burning pain. Every day, the survey team members carry things on their backs and walk back and forth in the difficult-to-walk muddy ponds covered with tussock grass. Their bodies are like falling into the river, soaked by the dew in the grass and the water in the muddy ponds. The comrades of the surveying team, in order to create straight survey lines, do not know how many high mountains they have to climb, how many rushing rivers they have to cross, how many muddy ponds of tussock grass and poisonous and thorny shrubs they have to walk through. Once, the second surveying team of the eighth detachment (Liu Qihan's team) had to pass through a mountain 1,500 meters above sea level to set up the survey line. At first, they walked up step by step, and when they couldn't walk, they slowly climbed up. As everyone knows, the air is thin at high altitudes, and the team members are so tired that they can't breathe. They are even more thirsty, and after they drank all the water they brought, their throats were so dry that they were smoking... But this difficulty did not stop them, and they finally climbed to the top of the mountain and set up the survey line.
    In the labor competition, the team members were even more energetic and went out to work even on rainy days, but it was difficult to record the figures obtained in the field, because the recording materials would be useless once they were wet. In order to overcome this difficulty and complete the task ahead of schedule, Comrade Li Shichen of the tenth team of the sixth detachment created a "rain cover" (made of oilcloth, shaped like a small umbrella) tied to his body, and persisted in his work.
    Severe winter has arrived, and pure white snow covers the entire Greater Khingan Range. The mountain wind howls, making a shrill cry. The young survey team members are facing new difficulties: the instruments are swayed and unstable by the wind; if the instruments are not stable, it is difficult to grasp the accuracy and cannot work. In order to stabilize the instruments, the team members grit their teeth and let their hands endure the cold pain like a knife cut. Liu Tiankui, a first-class labor model of the eighth detachment, is the leader of the boundary line pulling group. In order to rush to pull the boundary line, he led all the comrades in the group to bivouac on the snow for days, and finally completed the task of a management area five days ahead of schedule.
    Why are these young survey team members able to work with such selfless spirit? Because they deeply know how important and glorious the task entrusted to them by the people of the whole country is! Whenever they complete their work for the day and walk happily back to their tents, they sing loudly:
    We are forest warriors,
    Good sons and daughters of the people.
    For the construction of the country's forestry,
    Strong and brave.
    Cross the mountains,
    Cross the deserts,
    Not afraid of wind and rain. ...
    With the singing, the team members' fatigue of the day also flies away!
    The footprints of the survey team members are everywhere in the Greater Khingan Range; the team members' sweat has also been sprinkled throughout the Greater Khingan Range.

    我们战斗在大兴安岭上
    在祖国的北部大兴安岭林区内，到处生长着高大的落叶松、樟子松和雪白笔直的白桦，构成了森林的海洋。这些都是国家经济建设中不可缺少的珍贵木材。
    为了使每一片林区的林木都能为祖国建设服务，为了使森林合理的生长和经营，林业部调查设计局在今年五月间，派了第一、二两个大队共计一千二百多人，浩浩荡荡进入了大兴安岭林区，开始野外森林调查。
    五月，在祖国的南方正是百花盛开的季节，人们正欣赏着灿烂瑰丽的景色和新鲜树叶的清香；在荒无人迹的大兴安岭却仍然飞舞着雪花和下着冰雹，满山遍野还披着厚厚的白雪，河川冻的如同一面镜子，充满着一片寒冬凛冽的气象。在这里，年轻的调查队员们开始了工作。他们有时在海拔数千公尺的大山上爬来爬去，有时在毒草刺人的灌木丛里穿来穿去，经常喝不到水，吃不到一顿热饭，睡不好一宿觉……。
    夏季里，林区格外闷热，阴雨连绵，就是晴天也密布着雾气，而且蚊子、小虫到处横飞，咬在身上就火辣辣地发痛。每天，调查队员们背着东西，在难以行走的长满了塔头草的污泥塘里走来走去，一个身子就像落在河里一样，给草中的露水和污泥塘的水淋的透湿。测量小队的同志们，为了打出标直的测线，不知要爬过多少崇高的山岭，渡过多少湍急的河流，穿过多少塔头草的污泥塘和毒草刺人的灌木。有一次，八中队第二测量小队（刘奇汉小队）打测线要穿过海拔一千五百公尺的大山，开始是一步一步往上走，走不动了就慢慢往上爬。谁都知道，山高空气稀薄，队员们累的喘不上气，嘴里就越发渴，背的水喝光了，嗓子干的直冒烟……。但是这个困难并没有难住他们，终于登上了山峰，打出了测线。
    在劳动竞赛中，队员们劲头更足，下雨天也出去干，但是要把在现地调查得来的数字记录下来是困难的，因为记录的材料一湿就不中用了。队员们为了突破这个困难，提前完成任务，六中队十小队李士臣同志创造了“遮雨器”（用油布做的，形状和小雨伞一样）绑在身上，坚持了工作。
    严冬降临了，洁白的雪笼罩着整个的大兴安岭，山风呼呼地刮着，发出了凄厉的叫声。年轻的调查队员又面临着新的困难：仪器被风刮的摇摆不稳；仪器弄不稳，难以掌握精度，就不能工作。为了弄稳仪器，队员们咬着牙让双手经受着像刀割一样的冷痛。八中队的一等劳动模范刘田奎是拉境界线的小组长，为了突击拉境界线，带着全组同志连日露宿在雪地上，终于提前五天完成了一个施业区的任务。
    为什么这些年轻的调查队员能够用这种忘我的精神来工作呢？因为他们深深知道，全国人民交给他们的任务是多么重大和光荣！每当完成了当天的工作而愉快地走回帐篷的途中，他们就响亮地唱着：
    我们是森林战士，
    人民的好儿女。
    为了建设祖国的林业，
    坚强又勇敢。
    跨过山岭，
    越过沙漠，
    不怕风和雨。…………
    随着歌声，队员们一天的疲劳也飞走了！
    大兴安岭到处有调查队员们的足迹；队员们的汗，也洒遍了整个的大兴安岭。
