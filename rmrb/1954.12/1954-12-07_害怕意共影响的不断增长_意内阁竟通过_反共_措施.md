　　Fearing the Growing Influence of the Italian Communist Party
　　Italian Cabinet Actually Passes "Anti-Communist" Measures
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 6th] According to TASS, Rome: The Italian government officially released the communique of the Italian Cabinet meeting on December 4th. The communique stated that Prime Minister Scelba made a report on the results of a "detailed investigation" into the activities of the Italian Communist Party in recent months.

　　The continuous growth of the Italian Communist Party's influence has aroused the unease and fear of the Italian ruling group; Scelba's report attempts to conceal the real reasons for the growth of the Italian Communist Party's influence, and distorts the increasingly broad support and trust that the Italian Communist Party has gained among the broad masses.

　　The communique stated that, based on this report, the cabinet meeting approved some measures: to establish an autocratic police system in the country, and to completely eliminate the remaining bit of bourgeois freedom. For example, restricting freedom of speech and publication; in the future, the Italian judicial authorities will treat the speeches published by Communist Party members in newspapers more strictly. In addition, it is also stipulated that Communist Party workers should be excluded from national institutions and state-managed enterprises.

    害怕意共影响的不断增长
    意内阁竟通过“反共”措施
    【新华社六日讯】　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利官方发表意大利内阁十二月四日会议的公报。公报中说，总理谢尔巴做了关于最近几个月对意大利共产党活动“详细调查”结果的报告。
    意大利共产党影响的不断增长引起意大利统治集团的不安和恐惧；谢尔巴的报告企图掩盖意大利共产党影响增长的真正原因，并且歪曲意大利共产党在广大群众中获得的越来越广泛的支持和信任。
    公报中说，根据这个报告，内阁会议批准了一些措施：将在国内建立专横的警察制度，把残余的一点点资产阶级自由也完全取消。譬如，限制言论和出版自由，意大利司法机构今后要更加严格地对待共产党员在报纸上发表的言论。此外，还规定了要排除国家机构中和国家管理的企业中的共产党工作人员。
