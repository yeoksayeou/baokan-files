    Hero's Mother Becomes Special-Class Model Military Family Member

    Wen Guizhen, the 60-year-old mother of Hu Xiudao, a first-class hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, was elected as a special-class model military family member in Jintang County, Sichuan Province in late November.

    This elderly woman always pays attention to using her labor to promote the country's construction. In order to complete the plan for developing domestic pigs, she carefully manages the feed for three pigs. This year, she harvested 865 jin of wheat, which she carefully collected. At the beginning of the summer grain requisition and purchase, she took the lead in handing over 247 jin of public grain and sold 600 jin of surplus grain. After the autumn harvest, she again took the lead in selling 800 jin of dried and winnowed surplus yellow rice to the state. After being elected as a representative to the county People's Congress, she subscribed to a farmer's newspaper and always asked her son to read it to her. She learned many principles of mutual aid and cooperation from the newspaper and led the mutual aid group members to participate in agricultural production cooperatives. In order to support the compulsory military service system stipulated in the Constitution and support the liberation of Taiwan, she said: "When the motherland needs it, I will definitely call my fifth son, Hu Xiugan, and sixth son, Hu Xitong, to serve."

    英雄的妈妈当了特等军属模范
    中国人民志愿军一级英雄胡修道的妈妈文贵珍，已在十一月下旬当选为四川省金堂县特等军属模范。
    这个六十岁的老人，时刻都注意用自己的劳动来促进国家的建设事业。为了完成发展毛猪的计划，她仔细地料理喂养三只猪的饲料。今年收了八百六十五斤小麦，她收捡得很好，到开始夏征和收购时，她便带头缴了二百四十七斤公粮，卖了六百斤余粮。秋收后，又带头把晒干扬净的八百斤剩余黄谷卖给国家。她当选为县人民代表大会代表后，订了一份农民报，随时叫儿子念给她听。她从报上知道许多互助合作的道理，就带动互助组员们参加农业生产合作社。为了拥护宪法规定的义务兵役制度，支援解放台湾，她说：“祖国需要时，我一定叫五儿胡修干、六儿胡修桐去服役。”
