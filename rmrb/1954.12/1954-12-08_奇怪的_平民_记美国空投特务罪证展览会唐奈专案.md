    Strange "Civilians"
    -- Notes on the U.S. Air-Dropped Special Agent Evidence Exhibition: The Downey Case
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng
    On the evening of November 29, 1952, at nine o'clock, a mysterious aircraft without any national markings quietly took off from Seoul Airport in South Korea. Protruding from its tail was a strange iron disc. It flew north along the east coast of Korea, carefully avoiding the intense anti-aircraft fire, darted across the Yalu River, and headed straight for Jilin in Northeast China. It circled low over a range of mountains, as if searching for a predetermined target. Suddenly, gunfire erupted. The plane plummeted like a wounded bird. The pilot and co-pilot were both killed. The other two Americans in military uniform were left, panic-stricken, on Chinese soil five thousand miles away from the United States.

    Now, the wreckage of this mysterious aircraft lies at the entrance of the U.S. Air-Dropped Special Agent Evidence Exhibition. The iron disc protruding from the tail of the plane was originally an air retrieval device, used to pick up special agents from the ground.

    Why did this aircraft have no national markings and such a special device attached to it? It turned out that it belonged to the Central Intelligence Agency's "black aircraft" fleet, and this time it was coming to China to retrieve American spy Li Junying. It had come to China more than once. On display in the exhibition are American carbines, submachine guns, radio stations, transmitters and receivers, navigation beacon lights, weather predictors, Japanese Fuji Sakura brand candles, large quantities of daily necessities... and the captured special agents Zhang Zaiwen, Xu Guangzhi, Yu Guanzhou, and Niu Songlin, all of whom it had smuggled across the border and airdropped. Now, it itself, along with the people and materials it airdropped, has fallen into the net of the Chinese people's law, serving as evidence of the U.S. government's activities of sending special agents and spies to infiltrate China for sabotage.

    The two unusual "guests" who survived on the plane are John Thomas Downey and Richard George Fecteau, professional spies from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency stationed at the Atsugi spy agency in Japan. Their photos are also on display in the exhibition hall. The photos show the scene of their capture. The pitch-black night, the glare of flashlights, and the stern muzzles of guns watched them closely. They silently lowered their heads, staring at the ground. Perhaps they were trying to find some justifiable reason for their secret trip hundreds of miles deep into Chinese territory? They seemed very anxious.

    Now, the U.S. official organs are obviously more anxious than they are. Exposing one's fox tail in front of all the countries and peoples of the world is ultimately embarrassing. Therefore, for the past ten days or so, all the American propaganda machines have been set in motion. Although the explanations of the U.S. Far East Command Headquarters and the U.S. Department of Defense have obvious contradictions, slapping each other in the face, they are still stubbornly insisting that Downey and Fecteau are "civilians." Well, let's take a look at the credentials of these two strange "civilians."

    It is said that these two unidentified "civilians" were on a "routine flight from Seoul to Tokyo." Strangely, what is displayed in the exhibition hall from these two "civilians" is not a map of Tokyo, but a U.S.-made map of China. Moreover, it is not an ordinary map of China, but a detailed map of Antu County, Jilin Province, China, on a scale of 1:250,000. Why would "civilians" going to Tokyo need a map of a county in China? China is clearly west of Tokyo, separated by Korea. Even if the deceased pilot were alive, it would be difficult for him to explain how his course could have deviated by ninety degrees, right? The clear and obvious fact is that this map of China was prepared in advance, and there is an arrow drawn in pencil on the map pointing to the Laoling area of Antu County, Jilin Province. It turns out that this is where Downey and Fecteau were trying to pick up the special agent Li Junying.

    Next to the map is a chart that further illustrates the identities of these two "civilians." This is a simple Chinese-English conversation chart. The first item is written in English, the second item is written in the Pinyin of the English, and the third item is written in Chinese. For example, the first item is written: (I am friend); the second item is written: (Wo shy bon yun); the third item is written: (我是朋友) [I am a friend]. The content of this conversation chart is indeed very interesting, and it is worth copying down in its entirety:

    "1. I am friend; 2. Please you help me; 3. I am thirsty, hungry, cold, sick, injured; 4. You understand? 5. Yes, No; 6. Take me there; 7. I will repay you; 8. How far? 9. I am China's friend; 10. Please you point direction; 11. East, South, West, North; 12. Thank you; 13. Good, not good; 14. Today, Tomorrow; 15. There have American? 16. They at there? 17. Take me China hospital; 18. China soldier top good; 19. I to hospital go; 20. I guarantee treat you good; 21. You have no boiled water? 22. You have warm clothes?"

    These are the "civilians" who were preparing to go to Tokyo, but they brought such a conversation chart. Obviously, they were not "civilians" going to Tokyo, but American spies sent to China to carry out activities. Moreover, they also envisioned such a situation for themselves: the plane being shot down, and the American "civilians," hungry, thirsty, cold, and injured, wandering in the mountains and forests of China, meeting the first Chinese person, quickly taking out the conversation chart and using the first sentence: "I am friend." Then, "Please you help me." "I am thirsty, hungry, cold, injured." "Take me there." Then take out the prepared pens, watches: "I will repay you!" And sweetly learn to say the ninth sentence: "I am China's friend." Prepare to hide, "Please you point direction." Also planning to find lost partners, asking: "There have American?" "They at there?" Meeting Chinese soldiers, also preparing to flatter and say: "China soldier top good." Also repeatedly planning to deceive and seduce: "I guarantee treat you good." But the most important thing is their own lives, being cold and thirsty, they have to repeatedly ask: "You have no boiled water?" "You have warm clothes?"...

    They had planned it this way, prepared it this way, in case they fell into the hands of the Chinese people, they would try to put on such a fox-like face to deceive, beg, and use money to lure, preparing to buy their lives.

    It seems that they were prepared correctly after all. The plane was indeed shattered in the Chinese sky, and they did indeed fall into the hands of the Chinese people. However, this conversation chart of deception and seduction that they had prepared was not used, and it was sent to the Chinese people's court and the exhibition.

    奇怪的“平民”
    ——记美国空投特务罪证展览会唐奈专案
    本报记者　金凤
    一九五二年十一月二十九日晚上九时，一架没有涂任何国籍标志的神秘的飞机，悄悄地从南朝鲜的汉城机场起飞了。在它的尾部突出一个奇怪的铁质圆盘。它沿着朝鲜的东海岸向北飞行，小心地绕过激烈的高射炮火网，窜过鸭绿江，直奔我国东北的吉林。它低低地在一带大山上空盘旋，仿佛寻找什么预定的目标。突然，枪声响了。飞机像受伤的小鸟般直坠下去。机上的正副驾驶员都摔死了。剩下另外两个穿着军装的美国人，惊惶失措地落在远离美国五千浬的中国地面上。
    现在，这架神秘的飞机残骸就躺在美国空投特务罪证展览会的大门口。飞机尾部突出的铁圆盘，原来是一个空取器，是为了把特务从地面上取走的。
    这一架飞机为什么没有涂任何国籍标志，而附着这样特殊的装置呢？原来它是属于美国中央情报局的“黑飞机”，这次是来中国准备空取美国间谍李军英。它已经不止一次来到中国。展览会中摆着的美国卡宾枪、冲锋枪、无线电台、收发报机、领航台信号灯、气象预测器、日本富士樱牌腊烛、大批日用品……以及被捕的特务张载文、许广智、于冠洲和牛松林，都是它偷越国境空投下来的。现在，它自身也同它空投下来的人和物资一起，落入中国人民的法网，作了美国政府派遣特务间谍潜入中国进行破坏活动的罪证。
    飞机上活着留下来的是两个不平常的“客人”。他们的照片也在展览室里陈列着。他们是美国中央情报局派驻日本厚木间谍机关的职业间谍约翰·托马斯·唐奈和理查德·乔治·费克图。照片上显示着他们被捕时的情景。漆黑的深夜、手电筒光和森严的枪口逼视着他们，他们默默地低着头，注视着地面。大概他们是在替自己偷偷地深入中国国境数百哩的这次神密的旅行寻找些什么可以见人的理由吧？他们显得很着急。
    现在，美国官方机关显然比他们更着急。在全世界国家和人民面前露出自己的狐狸尾巴终究是难堪的事情。因此这十几天来，美国所有的宣传机器开动了。尽管美国远东司令部总部和美国国防部的解释有着明显的矛盾，在互相打着耳光，但他们还是硬着头皮一致咬定唐奈和费克图两人是“平民”。那么，我们再来看看这两个奇怪的“平民”的证件吧。
    据说，这两位身份不明的“平民”是在作“从汉城到东京的例行飞行”。奇怪的是在展览室里陈列出来从这两位“平民”身上带来的不是什么东京地图，而是一幅美国制的中国地图。而且，还不是普通的中国地图，而是一幅二十五万分之一的中国吉林省安图县的详细地图。到东京去的“平民”为什么需要一幅中国一个县的地图呢？中国明明在东京的西面，中间还隔着朝鲜。已经死了的驾驶员即使活着，也很难回答他的航向怎么会发生九十度的错误吧？清清楚楚的事实是：这一幅中国地图是事先准备好的，地图上还有铅笔画着的指向吉林省安图县老岭区的箭头。原来这里就是唐奈和费克图企图取走特务李军英的地方。
    在地图旁边展览着的一张图表，更足以说明这两位“平民”的身份。这是一张简单的中英文会话表。第一项写着英文，第二项写着中文的英文拼音，第三项写着中文。譬如第一项写着：（I amfriend）；第二项写着：（Wo shy bon yun）；第三项写的是：（我是朋友）。这一张会话表的内容委实是十分有趣的，值得把它全部抄下来：
    “一、我是朋友；二、请你帮我；三、我渴、饿、冷、病了、受伤；四、你懂吗？五、是，不是；六、带我到那边；七、我会报答你；八、有多远？九、我是中国的朋友；十、请你指方向；十一、东、南、西、北；十二、谢谢；十三、好、不好；十四、今天、明天；十五、那里有美国人？十六、他们在那里？十七、带我到中国医院；十八、中国兵顶好；十九、我到医院去；二十、我担保待你好；二十一、你没有开水吗？二十二、你有暖护（和字误）衣裳吗？”
    这就是准备到东京去的“平民”，却带了这样一张会话表。很显然，他们不是什么到东京去的“平民”，而是被派到中国来活动的美国间谍，而且，他们也给自己设想了这样的情况：飞机被击落下来，又饥、又渴、又冷、又负伤的美国“平民”在中国的山林中徘徊着，遇到了第一个中国人，赶紧掏出会话表来，用了第一句：“我是朋友。”接着就“请你帮我。”“我渴了，饿了，冷了，受伤了。”“带我到那边。”然后拿出准备好的钢笔、手表：“我会报答你！”又甜蜜地学说着第九句：“我是中国朋友。”准备躲起来，“请你指方向。”还打算找寻失落了的伙伴，探问着：“那里有美国人？”“他们在那里？”遇到中国战士，又准备谄媚地说：“中国兵顶好。”还要反反复复地欺骗和引诱：“我担保待你好。”可是顶顶要紧的还是自己的生命，又冷又渴，只得再三要求：“你有开水吗？”“你有暖和衣裳吗？”……
    他们是这样打算好了，准备好了，万一落到中国人民手里，就想摆出那样一副狐狸似的脸孔来欺骗，哀告，用金钱来引诱，准备给自己买命。
    看来，他们还是准备对了。飞机果然粉碎在中国天空，他们也果然落到中国人民的手里。但是，他们准备好的这一张欺骗和引诱的会话表却没有用得上，它被送到中国人民的法院和展览会里来了。
