This was the morning of November 18th. An air force squadron of a certain air force unit of our army on the Zhejiang front was flying along a predetermined route.

Shortly after the squadron flew over the sea off Zhejiang, pilot Ma Liancheng vaguely saw several small black dots on the sea ahead from the cockpit. Those were the Yushan Islands, where Jiang bandit troops were entrenched. As soon as they flew over the North Yushan Island, the Jiang bandit troops' anti-aircraft machine guns fired incessantly. Ma Liancheng and his comrades calmly piloted their planes, circling and searching for military targets on the ground. At this time, many white and yellow squares were visible on the ground, which were the Jiang bandit troops' group fortifications; outside the group fortifications, trenches surrounded them like many belts. Navigator Wang Weijiu accurately calculated the wind direction and speed, constantly searching for the predetermined bombing target in the sight. Telegraph operator Zhang Ruifu vigilantly monitored the sky, constantly communicating with the ground command post.

Ma Liancheng bravely piloted his warplane over the Jiang bandit troops' command post in the northern part of North Yushan Island, and navigator Wang Weijiu immediately pressed the button, and heavy bombs were continuously poured down to the ground. He stared at the falling bombs through the sight, which exploded in black smoke right at the location of the Jiang bandit troops' command post. Almost at the same moment, the comrades in the plane excitedly shouted: "Hit the target!" Then, the plane piloted by pilot Yu Baoxiang also accurately dropped bombs on the Jiang bandit troops' group fortifications.

Just as our air force warriors were fiercely bombing the Jiang bandit troops' command post and positions, suddenly, white clouds like umbrellas covered the entire North Yushan Island. Ma Liancheng skillfully maneuvered his warplane in a circle, dodged the white clouds, and the navigator aimed at the Jiang bandit troops' fortifications and bombed them in turn. Looking down from the plane: a cloud of smoke shrouded the Jiang bandit troops' positions, and the Jiang bandit troops' anti-aircraft machine guns, which had been spitting fire frantically just now, were also silenced.

The bombing mission was successfully completed. When our air force squadron victoriously returned, black smoke was still rising from the Jiang bandit troops' positions on North Yushan Island.

    胜利轰炸渔山列岛蒋贼军的空军勇士
    新华社记者　路云
    这是十一月十八日早晨，浙江前线我空军某部的一个空军机群沿着预定航线飞行着。
    机群飞临浙江海面上空不久，飞行员马连成从座舱里就隐约地看到了前面海面上的几个小黑点，那就是蒋贼军盘踞的渔山列岛。刚飞到北渔山岛的上空，岛上蒋贼军的高射机枪就不停地开火射击了。马连成和战友们沉着地驾驶着飞机盘旋着，搜索着地面上的军事目标。这时，只见地面上有很多一格格的白色和黄色的方块，这就是蒋贼军的集团工事；在集团工事的外边，像许多带子似地围绕着一道道的战壕。领航员王维玖精确地计算着风向和风速，不停地在瞄准镜里搜索着预定的轰炸目标。报务员张瑞福警惕地监视着天空，不断地和地面指挥所进行联络。
    马连成驾驶着战鹰勇敢地飞到北渔山岛北部蒋贼军指挥所的上空，领航员王维玖当即按了电钮，一颗颗沉重的炸弹连续向地面上倾泻下去。他睁大眼睛从瞄准镜里看着下落的炸弹，正好落在蒋贼军指挥所的位置上爆炸起了一团团的黑烟。几乎在这同一个时刻，飞机上的战友们都兴奋地喊着：“命中目标了！”接着，飞行员于宝祥驾驶的飞机，也把炸弹准确地投在蒋贼军的集团工事上。
    正当我空军战士们对蒋贼军的指挥所和阵地进行猛烈轰炸的时候，突然，一朵朵的白云像伞一样地遮住了整个北渔山岛。马连成驾驶着战鹰巧妙地转了一圈，闪过了白云，领航员又对准蒋贼军的工事轮番轰炸起来。从飞机上向下望去：蒋贼军阵地上笼罩着一片浓烟，刚才还慌乱地喷吐着火舌的蒋贼军的高射机枪也被炸哑了。
    轰炸任务胜利地完成了。当我空军机群胜利返航的时候北渔山岛蒋贼军阵地上还在冒着黑烟。
