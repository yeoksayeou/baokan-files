    The Origin of an Explosion Accident
    By our reporter Zhen Weimin
    A serious "water tank" explosion accident occurred at the Zhenjiang Power Plant in June of this year. It injured three young workers who were working in the engine room, one of whom died despite emergency treatment. The direct loss to the plant was 150 million yuan. It also caused a city-wide power outage of five hours and thirty-nine minutes, with preliminary estimates of losses reaching 2.49 billion yuan. The main culprit responsible for this accident was young worker Yu Baofa, because he did not operate according to the orders of the leadership.
    Yu Baofa's causing of this catastrophe was not accidental; it was the result of his consistent negligence, violation of labor discipline, and incorrect labor views and work attitude.
    Yu Baofa came to the Zhenjiang Power Plant in May 1952. He was initially assigned to the boiler workshop as an apprentice, but he was unhappy because he was afraid of the arduous labor of the boiler workshop. However, Yu Baofa's father had been a boiler worker for more than thirty years, and he had spent some time with his father around boilers, so he understood some of the technology. Therefore, he was also very proud and looked down on the several veteran workers in the boiler workshop. He had only been in the factory for two years, but he acted like a veteran master.
    Yu Baofa loved playing basketball since he was a child and was the captain of the factory's basketball team. He, a young technician named Xiao Gu from the factory, and three others from the power generation department who were good at playing basketball formed a team. Whether it was a formal competition or just playing around in the factory, they were always together. They were also a gang in ordinary times. Xiao Gu liked eating out and dancing, so they would go to restaurants together and go dancing on Saturday nights. As a result, most of his salary was spent on buying dancing shoes and tight-legged trousers. Yu Baofa also bought a watch and a pair of woolen trousers. He was determined to learn the "style," the more he could make people not see that he was a worker, the better.
    However, Yu Baofa had no interest in learning and labor. In the morning, during political studies, he was the last to sign the attendance book seven out of ten times. Once, at a study group meeting, he was late again. Sun Guanglin, an apprentice and Communist Party member, criticized him. He didn't say a word to his face, but complained behind his back: "Who do you think you are? I just won't come, what can you do about it?" The next day, he didn't come to study at all. But after lunch, you could always find him on the basketball court. When it was time for work, after the factory whistle had blown twice, he would walk into the workshop covered in sweat. Other people's work had already started, and he was still looking for tools. When there was a lot of work, he would pick and choose the easy tasks. When work was slack, he would smoke cigarettes and brag. When he was happy, he would start singing Shaoxing opera. A quarter of an hour before quitting time, he had already packed up his tools and washed his hands, just waiting for the whistle to blow. On Saturday afternoons, he was even busier, having to answer the phone in the power generation department once or twice to find out where there was a dance party.
    Because he was unwilling to treat labor honestly, modestly, and cautiously, Yu Baofa was constantly causing trouble. He had only been in the factory for a few days when he pretended to understand something he didn't, and went to fiddle with a planer, breaking a straight-headed screw. Once, the department sent him to the small pier to dismantle machinery. He acted cleverly and went to move one leg of a tripod crane, knocking over the tripod and injuring Master Liu Jilai. Another time, he was cutting copper wire with Sun Guanglin and others. He acted cleverly again, trying to cut two or three wires at once. When he couldn't cut them, he stepped on them with his foot. With a "crack," the copper wire pliers broke. Yu Baofa never faced up to his shortcomings, and did not realize that these problems were incompatible with the glorious title of worker. When the Youth League branch discussed his membership application, they criticized his serious shortcomings, such as his individualism, and did not agree to his admission. Yu Baofa regarded this as everyone deliberately embarrassing him, and from then on, whenever someone talked to him about joining the League, he simply refused: "You can do it, I can't." Others advised him: "Why can't you do it? Can't you correct your shortcomings?" "Can't is can't, I can't change!" This wrong attitude towards shortcomings led to the further development of Yu Baofa's mistakes.
    On June 17th of this year, Yu Baofa was working in the boiler room, responsible for flushing the boiler's "superheater tubes." He left the workshop before quitting time. Downstairs, he ran into Lin Genglai, deputy head of the power generation department and head of the boiler workshop. Master Lin asked him: "Baofa, how's it going up there?" "The water pump and inlet and outlet valves are closed, and the inlet steam valve is left a little bit open," he replied nonchalantly. When Master Lin Genglai heard this, he knew it was absolutely dangerous and said, "Quickly notify stoker Fang Shusheng to close the inlet steam valve of boiler room number two." But Yu Baofa, with his usual careless and self-righteous attitude, treated Lin Genglai's instructions as if he knew better, telling Fang Shusheng to leave the inlet steam valve "a little bit open." It was this "little bit" that caused the water tank to be unable to withstand the constant pressure of the incoming steam, and it finally exploded with a bang.
    Now, the Zhenjiang People's Court has sentenced Yu Baofa, the main person responsible for this accident, to one and a half years of imprisonment in accordance with the law, dismissed him from the factory, and the trade union has decided to expel him from membership. Lin Genglai, deputy head of the power generation department and head of the boiler workshop, also had negligence in safety, lack of organization and discipline, and dereliction of duty in this flushing of the boiler's "superheater tubes," and it has been decided to give him an administrative demotion. In addition, engineer Wu Jizong, who was also responsible for the accident to a certain extent, was also given a demerit.
    Yu Baofa's case has given the leadership and all employees of the Zhenjiang Power Plant a profound education. They are determined to learn from this lesson, further consolidate labor discipline in the future, recover the losses from this incident, and better fulfill the glorious tasks entrusted to them by the country and all the people.

    一件爆炸事故的来由
    本报记者　甄为民
    镇江水电厂在今年六月间发生了一次严重的“给水箱”爆炸事故。打伤了正在机室里工作的三个青年工人，其中一人急救无效身死，厂内直接损失达一亿五千万元。并使全市停电五小时三十九分，据初步统计损失达二十四亿九千万元。造成这次事故的主犯是青年工人郁宝发，原因是他不按照领导上的命令进行操作。
    郁宝发闯下这次大祸并不是偶然的，这是他一贯玩忽职守、违反劳动纪律和不正确的劳动观点和劳动态度所造成的恶果。
    郁宝发一九五二年五月到镇江发电厂，最初分配在锅炉工场作艺徒，他就不高兴，因为害怕锅炉工场艰苦的劳动。但另外，郁宝发的父亲曾做过三十几年的锅炉工人，他曾经跟父亲在锅炉边转过，多少懂得一些技术，因此他又很骄傲，看不起锅炉场的几个老师傅。进厂才不过两年，他就摆出了一副老师傅的架子。
    郁宝发从小爱打篮球，是本厂的篮球队长。他和厂里的一个年轻的技术员小顾，再加上发电科三个球打得好的人组成一队，不论是正式比赛或是厂里打着玩，他们五个人，总在一起，平常他们也是一伙儿。小顾爱吃馆子爱跳舞，他们就一起到酒馆去吃吃，星期六晚上去跳跳舞。因此，他的薪金，绝大部分都用到买跳舞皮鞋、买小脚管裤子上来了。郁宝发还买了一只手表、一条毛料的裤子。他决心学“派头”，越能使人家看不出他是个工人越好。
    但是，郁宝发对学习和劳动却没有兴趣。早上时事政治学习，签到簿上十次有七次他是最后一名。有次学习小组会，他又迟到了，艺徒、共产党员孙广林向他提出批评，他当面不吭气，背后就发牢骚：“你什么东西，我就是不来，你有什么办法。”第二天，他果然没有来学习。到了吃过中饭，在球场里你总可以找到他。上班了，厂里的汽笛已响过两遍，他才满头大汗走进车间。人家的工作已经开始，他还在找工具哩。工作多的时候，他要拣精拣肥。工作清闲时他就抽抽香烟，吹吹牛皮，逢高兴就拉开嗓子唱两句绍兴戏。离开下班的时间还有一刻钟，他已经收拾好工具，洗好了手，只等汽笛响了。到了星期六下午，那就更忙，起码要到发电科去接一两次电话，打听哪里有舞会。
    由于不肯老老实实地、虚心谨慎地对待劳动，郁宝发几乎不断地闯祸。他初到厂没有几天，不懂装懂，到刨床上去攀弄，把一个直头螺丝弄断了。有一次，科里派他到小码头去拆卸机器，他自作聪明去搬三脚架吊车的一只脚，碰倒了三脚架，打伤了刘吉来师傅。还有一次，他和孙广林等一起剪铜丝，又自作聪明，一次要剪两根三根，剪不下来就用脚踏，喀喳一声，铜丝钳子断了。郁宝发始终不正视自己的缺点，不知道这些毛病都是与光荣的工人称号不相符的。青年团支部在讨论他的入团问题时，曾对他的个人英雄主义等严重缺点提出过批评，不同意他入团，郁宝发反把这件事当做是大家故意下他的面子，从此再有人跟他说入团问题，他就干脆回绝：“你们行，我不行了”。别人劝他：“你怎么不行呢，有缺点不好改吗？”“不行就是不行嘛，改不了！”这种对待缺点的错误态度，就使得郁宝发的错误愈加发展。
    今年六月十七日，郁宝发在锅炉间上班，负责冲洗锅炉的“过热气管”。不到下班时间就离开了车间。在楼下，他碰到了发电科副科长兼锅炉场场长林耕来师傅。林师傅问他：“宝发，上面怎么样？”“水泵和进出水凡尔都关死了，进汽凡尔留了一点点。”他满不在乎地回答。林耕来师傅一听，知道这是绝对危险的，说：“你快去通知司炉方树生，把二号锅炉房的进汽凡尔关死。”但郁宝发以一贯漫不经心的、自以为是的高傲态度，对待林耕来的指示，要方树生把进汽凡尔“留一点点”。就是这个“一点点”，结果使得给水箱承受不了源源而来的蒸汽压力，终于轰然爆炸。
    现在，镇江市人民法院已依法判处这次事故的主要责任者郁宝发有期徒刑一年半，厂内开除厂籍，工会决定开除会籍。发电科副科长兼锅炉场场长林耕来在此次冲洗锅炉“过热气管”工作中，也存在着忽视安全和无组织无纪律及失职的行为，决定行政上给予降职处分。此外，此次事故中应负一定责任的工程师吴继宗也受到了记过的处分。
    郁宝发的案件，给了镇江水电厂的领导上和全体职工深刻的教育，他们决心要接受这个教训，在今后进一步巩固劳动纪律，挽回这次事件的损失，更好的完成国家和全体人民赋予的光荣任务。
