Vietnam News Agency, December 14th, commenting on the US directing Ngo Dinh Diem to create large-scale bloodshed in South Vietnam, said: After the US managed to relieve Nguyen Van Hinh of his position as Army Chief of Staff, it directed the Ngo Dinh Diem group to find ways to eliminate the Hoa Hao and Cao Dai troops that did not fully submit to them. Fierce fighting is taking place in the Long Xuyen area of western South Vietnam.

A portion of the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao organizations have become attached to Ngo Dinh Diem, and some of them have already joined the puppet government. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem group, under the direction of the United States, is trying its best to eliminate all unsubmissive forces in order to establish its complete rule. They are planning to purge the "pro-Nguyen Van Hinh elements" in Bao Dai's army. The Binh Xuyen sect is likely also to be a target for gradual elimination.

The article pointed out that Ngo Dinh Diem is forcibly recruiting Catholic youths who were forced to withdraw from North Vietnam into the army in order to establish six divisions of "security forces." The bloodshed currently occurring in the Long Xuyen area may erupt in other places, because the groups that are being encircled and are scheduled to be eliminated will certainly rise up to resist Ngo Dinh Diem and his American masters.

The article said that it is obvious that the US dispatched Collins to South Vietnam, which has intensified the atrocities there and created large-scale bloodshed in Indochina where peace has already been restored. The United States should bear full responsibility for this.

Xinhua News Agency: In late November, the Ngo Dinh Diem group continued to infringe upon the lives, property, and democratic freedoms of the people in the Guangyi Province assembly area in central Vietnam, and retaliated against those who had participated in the war of resistance.

On November 21, puppet troops stationed in Xingshan Village, Shanxing County, arrested Zhang Quan, the former cashier of the village, and confiscated his property.

On the evening of November 26, troops of the French Federation arrested and took away eleven residents of the village. After severely beating those arrested, they released four of them. On the evening of November 27, Ngo Dinh Diem's henchmen continued to send troops to bully the people.

    越南通讯社斥美国在南越制造大规模流血
    【新华社十六日讯】越南通讯社十四日评述美国在南越指挥吴庭艳制造大规模流血说：美国在设法免除了阮文馨的陆军参谋长职务以后，即指挥吴庭艳集团设法消灭没有完全顺从他们的和好教和高台教的部队。激烈战斗正在南越西部的龙川地区进行。
    一部分高台教及和好教组织已依附了吴庭艳，其中有一些人已经参加了伪政府。但是，吴庭艳集团受到美国的指使，极力要消灭一切不驯服的力量，以便建立它的完全统治。他们正在计划清洗保大军队中的“亲阮文馨分子”。平川教派很可能也是逐步清除的对象。
    文章指出，吴庭艳正在强迫把从北越被逼撤到南越的天主教青年拉入军队，以便建立六师“保安部队”。目前在龙川地区发生的流血可能在其他地方爆发，因为正被围剿和在计划中预定要被排除的集团，一定要起来抗击吴庭艳和它的美国主子。
    文章说，很明显，美国派遣柯林斯到南越，加强了那里的暴行，并在和平已经恢复了的印度支那制造大规模流血。美国应对此负完全责任。
    据新华社讯：吴庭艳集团十一月下旬在中越广义省集结区内继续侵犯人民的生命财产和民主自由，并对参加过抗战的人进行报复。
    十一月二十一日，驻在山星县星善村的伪军逮捕了村里的前出纳员张铨，并且没收了他的财产。
    二十六日晚上，法兰西联邦部队逮捕并带走了村中十一个居民。他们在毒打了这些被捕的人以后，释放了其中的四个。二十七日晚上，吴庭艳的爪牙继续派遣军队欺侮人民。
