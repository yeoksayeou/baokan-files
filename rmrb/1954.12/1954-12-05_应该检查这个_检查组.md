    This "Inspection Team" Should Be Inspected

    To the Editorial Comrades:

    A few months ago, our county was fervently carrying out the agricultural production over-quota increase campaign. Zeng Qinqiu, deputy director of the county Supervisory Committee, led Zhu Zhennan, a member of the Industrial Section, and Li Zuojing, a cadre of the County Discipline Inspection Committee, to the Seventh District to inspect work. At 11:00 AM, they met with Secretary Liang of the Seventh District, had some boiled water, and began with pleasantries. Cadre Li blurted out, "Oh dear! The weather is so hot, I haven't taken a bath in three days, I really should take a comfortable bath today." Deputy Director Zeng was about to speak when Secretary Li of the District Committee arrived. So the inspection team first stated their intentions, followed by another round of polite words. The conversation led to lunchtime.

    After the meal, Cadre Li brought up the suggestion of taking a bath again, and the other two unanimously agreed: This was a rational suggestion, excellent. So the guests busied themselves with bathing and tidying up their luggage, and after bathing, they busied themselves with washing clothes.

    Soon, Deputy Director Zeng actually discovered a gramophone in Secretary Liang's room. So they began to enjoy Mei Lanfang's Peking Opera "Si Lang Visits His Mother", "Pinggui Returns to His Cave", "Farewell My Concubine"...

    Unknowingly, it was already 3:50 PM when they suddenly heard that the Sandu Cooperative was being established today, so they could also go and "inspect" it. Thus, the three of them went to the scene together. The cooperative was not large and the goods were not new. They stood at the entrance for a while and then turned to leave. As they exited the street, they saw a building with a sign for a clinic. They went in, but the director was not at home, so they had to forget about it.

    After dinner, the sun had not yet set. District Committee Secretary Li gently suggested, "While the weather is not hot, let's go to the key townships and take a look!" So they were accompanied by District Committee Secretary Li and Liang Zhongqiu of the township work team. There were endless scenes to see, and they quickly visited all twelve administrative groups! On the way back, Cadre Li spoke first: "The Sixth District has a lot of second-season sorghum, the Eighth District has a lot of autumn sweet potatoes, and the Seventh District has a lot of double-cropping rice." The conversation started up like that. Their impression of the work was: "The Sixth District has both points and surface, the Seventh District is good at points but lacks surface."

    The sun had set, and the moon was climbing to the top of the mountain. From somewhere came good news – "Sandu Market has a storytelling performance with a drum!"

    "Storytelling with a drum"! What a refreshing folk art, everyone was invigorated to go. Unfortunately, the weather was not good, and it suddenly started to rain. By the time the performance ended and they walked back in the rain, it was already 9:50 PM.

    At night, there were many mosquitoes, and they couldn't sleep. Someone suggested playing cards, so everyone got up to "burn the midnight oil," playing until late at night.

    The next morning, they started playing the gramophone as soon as they got up. Unexpectedly, Section Member Zhu used too much force and broke the spring. Deputy Director Zeng had a flash of inspiration and suggested "borrowing" a few satisfactory records to take back. This was immediately supported by everyone, so everyone's energy was focused on selecting records. Suddenly, one of them remembered that they had to rush back for a meeting today, so they hurriedly packed their bags and left the District Office without even paying for the meals.

    What exactly did this inspection team come to do? They should be inspected themselves.

### 应该检查这个“检查组”

    应该检查这个“检查组”编辑同志：
    几个月前，我县正在火热地开展农业生产超额增产运动，县监察委员会副主任曾钦秋带领着工业科科员朱振南、县委纪律检查委员会干事李作精到七区去检查工作。十一点钟，他们和七区梁秘书接了头，喝了一阵开水，开始了寒暄。李干事劈头就说：“唉呀！天气太热，三天没洗澡了，今天也该洗个舒服澡才对。”曾副主任正想开言，恰巧区委会李书记赶来了，于是检查组首先表明了来意，接着又是一套客气话。谈谈就到吃中饭的时候了。
    饭后，李干事又提出了洗澡的建议，其他二人一致响应：这是一个合理化建议，好极了。于是客人们忙着洗澡和整理行装，洗了澡又忙着洗衣服。
    不久，曾副主任竟在梁秘书房内发现了留声机，于是就开始欣赏梅兰芳的京剧“四郎探母”、
  “平贵回窑”、“霸王别姬”……。
    不知不觉已经三点五十分了，忽然听说三都合作社今天成立，也可以去“检查”“检查”，于是三人一起亲临现场。合作社，规模不大，货色也不新鲜，他们在门口站了一会转身就走。出街口，看到一座房子挂着卫生所的牌子，进去一看，所长不在家，只好算了。
    吃过晚饭，太阳还没有落山，李区委书记温和地建议：“趁天气不热，先到重点乡去看看吧！”于是便由李区委书记和乡工作组的梁中秋同志陪同前往，看不完的景致，很快就走遍了十二个行政组！归途中，李干事首先发言：“六区的二季高粱多，八区的秋红薯多，七区的双季稻多。”话匣子就这样打开了。他们对工作的印象是：“六区有点有面，七区就是点好没有面。”
    太阳落下去了，月亮正爬上山巅，不知从那里传来了一个好消息——“三都圩上打渔鼓！”
    “打渔鼓”！多新鲜的民间艺术，大家一鼓劲儿去。可惜，天不作美，忽然下起雨来，等渔鼓散了场，冒雨走回来时已是九点五十分。
    夜里，蚊子多，睡不着，有人提议打扑克，于是都爬起来“开夜车”，一直打到深夜。
    第二天早晨，一起床就开留声机，不料朱科员用力过猛，把发条弄断了。曾副主任灵机一动，主张挑选几张满意的唱片“借”回去。立即得到大家的拥护，于是大家的精力集中在挑选唱片上。忽然他们中间有一个人想起今天要赶回去开会，于是匆匆忙忙地整理好行装，连饭钱也不付就跨出了区公所的大门。
    这个检查组究竟是来干什么的？应该检查一下。
