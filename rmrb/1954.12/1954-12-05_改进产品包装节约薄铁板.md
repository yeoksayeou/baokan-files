The Bureau of Chemical Industry under the Ministry of Heavy Industry has improved its product packaging work, and it is estimated that more than 5,400 tons of thin iron sheets, worth 48.08 billion yuan, can be saved this year.

Packaging chemical products requires a lot of thin iron sheets, generally accounting for about 10 to 20 percent of the commodity cost. In order to save thin iron sheets, the Bureau of Chemical Industry has implemented several effective measures: 1. Implement the method of "one barrel, multiple uses" and establish a "iron barrel recycling" system. Since implementing the recycling system, eight enterprises including Shenyang Chemical Plant have saved more than 4,200 tons of thin iron sheets. 2. Load as much as possible without affecting product quality and commodity transportation. For example, in the past, a bleaching powder barrel held 140 kilograms, but now it can hold 160 kilograms. 3. Substitute thin for thick. In the past, some enterprises used 1.2 mm iron sheets to manufacture iron barrels for packaging caustic soda and sulfide soda. Now, they use 0.5 mm to 0.7 mm iron sheets, which greatly reduces the amount of iron sheets required. For example, one kilogram of 0.5 mm iron sheet can package 28 kilograms of caustic soda, while 1.2 mm iron sheet can only package 12 kilograms of caustic soda. This improvement alone saved 392 tons in the first three quarters, worth more than 3.4 billion yuan. 4. Replace iron barrels with wooden boxes. The "666" insecticide produced by enterprises under the Bureau of Chemical Industry is sometimes packaged in iron barrels and sometimes in wooden barrels. This year, it will be uniformly packaged in wooden barrels, which can save 374 tons of thin iron sheets. It also facilitates the distribution and transportation of the cooperative. Because iron barrels have a large capacity, the cooperative must make another wooden box when distributing to the grass-roots cooperatives, which now saves the procedure of re-packaging. This saves manpower, reduces product loss, and reduces the burden on farmers. 5. Implement the most economical cutting method. For example, Dalian Dyestuff Factory uses a new cutting method that saves more than 21% of iron sheets compared with the old method. It is estimated that it can save 50 tons of thin iron sheets this year.

    改进产品包装节约薄铁板
    重工业部化学工业管理局改进了产品包装工作，预计今年可节约薄铁板五千四百多吨，价值四百八十多亿元。
    包装化工产品需用很多薄铁板，一般的占商品成本百分之十至二十左右。化学工业管理局为了节约薄铁板，实行了几种有效的办法：一、实行“一桶多次用”的办法，建立了“铁桶回收”制度。沈阳化工厂等八个企业从实行回收制度以来，已节约薄铁板四千二百多吨。二、在不影响产品质量和商品运输的条件下，尽量多装。如过去一个漂白粉桶装一百四十公斤，现在已经能装到一百六十公斤。三、以薄代厚。过去有些企业用一点二粍的铁板制造包装烧碱和硫化碱的铁桶，现在改用零点五粍至零点七粍的铁板，大大降低了需用铁板的数量。如一公斤零点五粍的铁板可以包装二十八公斤烧碱，一点二粍的铁板只能包装十二公斤烧碱。这一项改进，在前三个季度就能节约三百九十二吨，价值三十四亿元以上。四、用木箱代替铁桶。化学工业管理局所属企业生产的“六六六”杀虫剂，有的用铁桶装，也有用木桶的。今年统一用木桶包装，可节约薄铁板三百七十四吨。而且便利了合作总社的分销、运输。因为铁桶容量较大，合作总社在分发给基层社时，必须另制木桶包装，现在就省去一次改装的手续。这样就节省了人力，减少了产品的损耗率，减轻了农民的负担。五、实行最经济的裁料方法。如大连染料厂用新的裁料方法比旧法节省铁板百分之二十一以上，预计今年能节约薄铁板五十吨。
