    Large-Scale Acquisition of Scattered Oil Crops in Various Parts of Shaanxi

    Various parts of Shaanxi Province are extensively acquiring scattered oil crops such as sunflowers, castor seeds, and small flax seeds. In late August, the Shaanxi Provincial Company of the China Oils and Fats Corporation signed oil crop procurement contracts successively with the Hanzhong, Baoji, Weinan, and Ankang Special Administrative Region offices of the Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative. According to incomplete statistics from early November, various localities have already acquired more than 570,000 jin of various scattered oil crops. (Yuan Li)

    陕西各地大量收购零星油料
    陕西省各地大量收购向日葵、蓖麻籽、小麻籽等零星油料。八月下旬，中国油脂公司陕西省公司就先后同陕西省供销合作社汉中、宝鸡、渭南、安康等专区办事处签订了油料代购合同。据十一月上旬不完全的统计，各地已经收购各种零星油料五十七万多斤。　（袁理）
