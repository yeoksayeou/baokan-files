Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway Jier Section
Track Laid to the Last Station Yesterday
[This newspaper reports] The track-laying work for the Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway within China was completed to Erlian Station on December 7th. It is expected that the track will be laid to the Sino-Mongolian border on the 9th.

Over the past ten days or so, the Ji(ning)-Er(lian) line has frequently experienced wind and snow, with the temperature dropping to as low as minus 37 degrees Celsius. Workers from the Track-Laying Team of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways braved the wind, snow, and severe cold, clearing more than a foot of accumulated snow from the roadbed, and persisted in laying tracks forward. On December 7th, they laid the tracks to the last station in China—Erlian Station, which is only four kilometers away from the border. Now, the workers of the Track-Laying Team are continuing to advance north from Erlian and are expected to lay tracks to the Sino-Mongolian border on the 9th.

The track-laying project for the Jier line started on June 15th last year. Before October this year, a total of 176 kilometers of main line tracks were laid. Since the joint communiqué was issued by China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia regarding the construction of the railway from Jining to Ulaanbaatar and the organization of joint transportation, the workers of the Track-Laying Team have been actively striving to lay tracks to Erlian ahead of schedule. Workers from the sleeper-laying squad, in order to accelerate the track-laying progress, transferred four people to support the track-laying; hammering workers also helped to move sleepers. The hammering team strictly checked the quality, and while creating a new record of laying 4.16 kilometers of track in one day, they also basically ensured the quality. Thanks to the efforts of the workers of the Track-Laying Team, the plan to complete track-laying to Erlian ahead of schedule has been realized. Now, the engineering trains from Jining to Erlian are running smoothly, creating favorable conditions for the construction of other projects for joint transportation next year.

### 集宁—乌兰巴托铁路集二段  昨天铺轨到最后一个车站

    集宁—乌兰巴托铁路集二段
    昨天铺轨到最后一个车站
    【本报讯】集宁—乌兰巴托铁路在我国境内的筑路工程，十二月七日已经铺轨到二连车站。预计在九日铺轨到中蒙边境。
    最近十几天来，集（宁）二（连）线上经常刮风下雪，气温最低降到摄氏零下三十七度。铁道部第三工程局钉道队职工冒着风雪严寒，铲除路基上一尺多深的积雪，坚持向前铺轨，十二月七日已经把钢轨铺到我国境内最后一个车站——二连车站，离国境线只有四公里多了。现在钉道队职工正由二连继续向北挺进，预计在九日铺轨到中蒙边境。
    集二线铺轨工程从去年六月十五日开始，到今年十月以前，正线共铺轨一百七十六公里。自从中、苏、蒙三国发表关于修建从集宁到乌兰巴托的铁路并组织联运的联合公报以后，钉道队职工就积极争取提前铺轨到二连。穿枕木小队的工人，为了加速铺轨进度，抽出了四个人，支援钉道；打锤的工人也帮助搬枕木。打锤班严格地检查了质量，在创造一天铺轨四点一六公里的新纪录时，也基本上保证了质量。由于钉道队职工的努力，提前完成铺轨到二连的计划已经实现。现在，集宁到二连的工程列车，已经畅通，为修建明年通车联运的其他工程创造了有利条件。
