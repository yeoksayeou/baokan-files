    National Grain Output Exceeds Last Year
    [This newspaper dispatch] Despite the fact that many regions in our country suffered from floods this year, the national total grain output still exceeded last year's by about 3 percent, thanks to the leadership at all levels who led farmers to resolutely fight against the disasters, and the non-disaster areas vigorously launched over-production campaigns.
    According to preliminary statistics from various regions, the total sown area of grain crops nationwide was more than 1.93 billion mu, exceeding the planned area by 3 percent, an increase of more than 40 million mu compared to last year. The estimated total output is about 340 billion jin, reaching about 95 percent of the planned output, exceeding last year's output by about 3 percent. The harvests of various grain crops are as follows: a bumper harvest of wheat, achieving the highest annual output in history, exceeding the plan by 9 percent, an increase of 27 percent compared to last year; a bumper harvest of early rice, an increase of 10 percent compared to last year. The total output of rice, including middle and late rice, only reached 93 percent of the plan due to disasters, but it is still equivalent to last year's output level. Soybean output reached about 90 percent of the plan, equivalent to 97 percent of last year's output; miscellaneous grain output (including potatoes) reached 94 percent of the planned output, exceeding last year's output by about 2 percent.
    Various regions have expanded the planting area of oil crops this year. It is estimated that the sown area of major oil crops such as peanuts, rapeseed, and sesame is about 72 million mu, an increase of 4 million mu compared to last year. The total output of these three crops can reach 8.2 billion jin, an increase of about 18 percent compared to last year. Other oil crops have also been planted more widely in various regions through vigorous promotion.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 9th: The harvesting of grain crops in the fields of Guangxi Province has been completed. The total grain output of the province has increased by 1.8 billion jin compared to last year, of which the increase in rice output reached 1.3 billion jin. Guangxi Province has never had such a large increase in grain production in its history.
    This year, organized farming households in Guangxi Province accounted for 60 percent of the total number of farming households in the province. They led individual farmers to make full use of the subtropical superior natural conditions, expand the sown area, and strengthen field management in accordance with the national production plan. Thirty-five thousand mu of single-season rice fields throughout the province were converted to double-season rice fields; the autumn sown area was expanded by 53 percent compared to last year; and rice fields with appropriate close planting accounted for about 60 percent of the paddy field area in various regions. In the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 570,000 mu of dry land was barren last year, but this year it has been planted with corn, dry rice, and buckwheat. Along the coast of the Gulf of Tonkin, nearly one million mu of late rice was generally tilled and fertilized once more than last year. In addition, the state issued 213.6 billion yuan of agricultural loans to farmers in Guangxi Province, which also played a significant supporting role in increasing grain production.

    全国粮食总产量超过去年
    【本报讯】今年我国不少地区虽然遭受了水灾，但由于各级领导机关领导农民坚决向灾害作斗争，非灾区大力开展超额增产运动，全国粮食总产量仍超过去年百分之三左右。
    据各地初步统计，全国粮食作物播种面积为十九亿三千多万亩，超过计划面积百分之三，比去年扩大四千多万亩。预计总产量约可达三千四百亿斤，达计划产量百分之九十五左右，超过去年产量百分之三左右。各种粮食作物的收成是：小麦丰收，获得历史上最高的年产量，超额完成计划百分之九，比去年增加百分之二十七；早稻丰收，比去年增产百分之十，中、晚稻因灾减产，稻谷总产量虽只完成计划百分之九十三，但仍相当于去年产量的水平；大豆产量达计划百分之九十左右，相当去年产量的百分之九十七；杂粮产量（包括薯类）达计划产量百分之九十四，超过去年产量百分之二左右。
    各地今年都扩大了油料作物种植面积。预计花生、油菜籽、芝麻等主要油料作物播种面积共约七千二百万亩，比去年扩大了四百万亩。这三项作物的总产量可达八十二亿斤，比去年增加百分之十八左右。其他油料作物经大力提倡，各地栽种也较多。
   【新华社南宁九日电】广西省田野上的粮食作物已收割完毕。全省粮食总产量比去年增加十八亿斤，其中稻谷的增产量达十三亿斤。广西省历史上从来没有增产过这样多的粮食。
    今年广西省组织起来的农户已占全省总农户百分之六十。他们带动单干农民按照国家生产计划，充分利用亚热带优越的自然条件，扩大了播种面积，加强了田间管理。全省有三十五万亩单季稻改成双季稻；秋季播种面积比去年扩大了百分之五十三；各地推行适当密植的稻田占水田面积百分之六十左右。在桂西僮族自治区，有五十七万亩旱地去年是光秃秃的原野，今年种上了玉米、旱稻和荞麦。沿东京湾海滨，近百万亩晚稻普遍比去年多耘了一次田，多施了一次肥。此外，国家发放给广西省农民二千一百三十六亿元农业贷款，对增产粮食也起了很大的支持作用。
