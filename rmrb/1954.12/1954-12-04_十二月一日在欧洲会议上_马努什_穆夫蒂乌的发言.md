Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 2nd:
Comrades!

	The Government of the People's Republic of Albania and the Albanian people welcome the Soviet government's proposal to convene an all-European conference on the establishment of a European collective security system, because such a system is a solid foundation for peaceful cooperation and a guarantee of national security for European countries. The establishment of such a system fully conforms to the vital interests of the Albanian people and the People's Republic of Albania, and at the same time creates favorable conditions for a just solution to the German problem.

	The Government of the People's Republic of Albania welcomes this proposal from the Soviet government, considering it a major international event in the interests of European peace and security. The Soviet Union's peace policy and its consistent and continuous efforts in this regard are well known to everyone and have received widespread support from peace-loving governments and peoples.

	The People's Republic of Albania is a small, peace-loving country, and its vital interests require the consolidation of peace and security in Europe and a just solution to the German problem.

	Therefore, the Albanian government has always supported the Soviet government's proposals on this issue and believes that the current conference is of great significance for safeguarding peace and the interests of all peoples.

	As everyone knows, recently, under the direct pressure of the American imperialist bloc, some European countries signed exclusive agreements regarding West Germany in London and Paris. These agreements have absolutely nothing in common with the interests of safeguarding European peace and security; they have absolutely nothing in common with the efforts made by peace-loving countries to resolve issues that have not yet been resolved, especially the German issue, and to further ease international tensions.

	These agreements stipulate the revival of militarism in West Germany, the establishment of German armed forces, and West Germany's participation in military blocs used by some countries against other European countries. Therefore, it clearly violates the Yalta and Potsdam agreements, which took the elimination of German militarism and the transformation of Germany into a peaceful and democratic country as their primary tasks; it also clearly violates other existing agreements and the solemn obligations assumed by the four powers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union on the German issue. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France have undermined these agreements and obligations, embarked on a dangerous and adventurous path, and intend to drag the entire Europe onto this path.

	The London and Paris agreements threaten the peace and the lives of the people of Europe. It is the embodiment of the policy of establishing military aggression blocs, and the incarnation of the policy of war and aggression. Despite some claims that arming West Germany and making it a member of a military bloc is necessary for the "defense" of Western countries, it cannot cover up the true purpose of remilitarizing West Germany.

	This statement cannot deceive anyone. History proves that German militarism has always been a factor of aggression, not a factor of defense. The purpose of establishing the so-called "European Army" is to revive the West German "Wehrmacht" as a strike force against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, according to the plan to establish an exclusive military bloc composed of the United States and Western European countries.

	Ratification of the Paris agreements would make the task of peacefully resolving the German issue by establishing a unified, democratic, and peaceful Germany more difficult, that is to say, it would permanently divide Germany into two parts, and would create a constant threat to peace in Europe. Ratification of the Paris agreements would create a serious threat in Europe, because the revival of German militarism and West Germany's participation in military blocs such as the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would pose a direct threat to European peace, greatly increase the risk of launching a new war in Europe, and lead to a new world war. The establishment of armed forces has already begun in West Germany, and the production of armaments exceeds the scope stipulated in the Paris agreements; West German military industry is rapidly developing, and American capital is clearly participating in West Germany's military industry. Although there are provisions in the Paris agreements limiting the quantity and quality of armed forces and equipment, the words and deeds of the Bonn rulers prove that these provisions have no effect on German militarists. The new "Wehrmacht" is led precisely by those Hitler generals who commanded the "Wehrmacht" in World War II and committed heinous crimes against the people of Europe.

	Ratification of the Paris agreements will create a new source of aggression in Central Europe. This places a heavy responsibility on the countries participating in the Paris agreements and forces peace-loving countries to take new measures to ensure their security.

	The delegation of the People's Republic of Albania is convinced that this conference will help the people of European countries understand how dangerous the Paris agreements are. The unforgettable suffering and trauma brought to the people of European countries by Hitler's Germany's aggression in World War II should make the governments and people of European countries never allow the revival of German militarism—the mortal enemy of the freedom and lives of the people of Europe and the German people. They must work together to establish a European collective security system and strengthen peace and the security of all peoples.

	The Government of the People's Republic of Albania and the Albanian people support all efforts to strengthen peace and security in Europe, and oppose the London and Paris agreements, because these agreements stipulate the remilitarization of West Germany and West Germany's participation in military blocs of certain countries hostile to other European countries.

	The Albanian people have historically waged tireless struggles for independence and against foreign oppressors. The Albanian people were ruled by Turkish occupiers for 450 years. Albania shook off Turkish rule in 1912 and declared national independence, but until November 29, 1944, Albania was once again in the shackles of imperialist forces, so the Albanian people had no choice but to take up arms and fight, regardless of great sacrifices.

	During twenty-four years, German troops invaded and ravaged our country twice. During World War II, Albania became a victim of Fascist aggression. The Albanian people fought side by side with the people of other anti-Fascist countries in the anti-Fascist Grand Alliance, bravely and selflessly fighting the occupiers for six years. The losses suffered by the Albanian people in World War II were quite large compared to other European countries: 28,800 people died, 12,600 were injured, and 12,150 were disabled and imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps. Thirty-five percent of the country's villages and cities were burned down. The material losses suffered by Albania amounted to approximately one billion US dollars (calculated at the 1938 exchange rate).

	It has been ten years since Albania became a free Albania forever for the first time in its many centuries of history. The Albanian people have become truly free people for the first time, the masters of their own country. The Albanian people are no longer oppressed by oppressors, and they are building their own happy and prosperous new life.

	The People's Republic of Albania is a truly peace-loving country. Historically, Albania has never attacked other countries. The entire foreign policy and domestic policy of the People's Republic of Albania embody the will and efforts of the Albanian people and its government to safeguard and consolidate peace in the Balkan Peninsula and Europe.

	At home, carrying out peaceful construction to continuously improve the material and cultural well-being of the people; establishing normal relations, friendship, and sincere cooperation with all other countries on the basis of equality, mutual respect for independence and national sovereignty, mutual respect for territorial integrity, and mutual benefit—this is the policy of the People's Republic of Albania.

	In the past, Albania was isolated and helpless, a small pawn of those mortal enemies of our country and our people—foreign imperialists. The current People's Republic of Albania is a free, democratic, and sovereign country; the current Albanian people are not isolated, they have some strong and reliable friends—the people of the brotherly countries of the strong peaceful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are with them. The Albanian people will never let history repeat itself, and history can never be repeated.

	Our delegation, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, expresses its complete agreement with Comrade Molotov, head of the Soviet delegation, regarding the assessment of the current international situation, and expresses its support for his proposals regarding safeguarding and consolidating peace and security in Europe and the security of our countries.

	The Albanian delegation also fully agrees with the opinions of Comrade Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Poland, Comrade Široký, Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic, and Comrade Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, regarding the issue of ensuring the security of our countries and peace in Europe.

	The People's Republic of Albania will consistently continue to implement a constructive peace policy and a policy of consolidating fraternal relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries. We are willing to contribute all our strength together with the other countries participating in this conference, and are willing to take the necessary measures to defend peace and security in Europe.

	Once the Paris agreements are ratified, the Government of the People's Republic of Albania is also prepared to take concrete collective measures in the military field together with the countries participating in this conference, in order to defend the creative and peaceful labor of our peoples, guarantee the inviolability of the borders of our countries, and resist any aggression.

	We express that our government and our people fully believe that this conference is a valuable and significant contribution to the cause of defending and consolidating peace and security in Europe. The governments of the peace-loving European countries participating in this conference fully realize that the revival of West German armed forces and West Germany's participation in aggressive Western military blocs in accordance with the London and Paris agreements is a threat to the cause of peace and security in Europe as a whole, especially to our countries. They are also fully aware that European countries must take coordinated actions to maintain and consolidate peace and security in Europe.

	The delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of Albania will do its utmost to ensure that our conference can successfully achieve the goals that meet the aspirations and interests of the people of European countries.

### 十二月一日在欧洲会议上  马努什·穆夫蒂乌的发言

    十二月一日在欧洲会议上
    马努什·穆夫蒂乌的发言同志们！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和阿尔巴尼亚人民欢迎苏联政府关于就建立欧洲集体安全体系问题召开全欧会议的建议，因为这样的体系是和平合作的巩固基础，是欧洲各国国家安全的保证，建立这样的体系完全符合阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的切身利益，而且同时为德国问题的公正解决创造了有利的条件。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府欢迎苏联政府这一建议，认为这是符合欧洲和平和安全的利益的重大国际事件。苏联的和平政策以及它在这方面一贯不断的努力是大家都知道的，而且得到各爱好和平的政府和人民的广泛支持。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国是一个爱好和平的小国，它的切身利害要求巩固欧洲的和平和安全，要求公正地解决德国问题。
    因此，阿尔巴尼亚政府一向支持苏联政府在这个问题上的建议，并且认为，目前的会议对保障和平和各国人民的利益有重大的意义。
    大家知道，最近，在美国帝国主义集团的直接压力下，欧洲某些国家在伦敦和巴黎签订了关于西德的排他性协定。这些协定同保障欧洲和平和安全的利益完全没有共同之点；同各爱好和平的国家为解决到现在为止仍然没有解决的问题、首先是德国问题，为进一步缓和国际紧张局势而作的努力，完全没有共同之点。
    这些协定规定在西德复活军国主义，建立德国武装部队，使西德参加某些国家用来对付另外一些欧洲国家的军事集团。因此，它明显地违反了以肃清德国军国主义和把德国变成一个和平民主国家作为主要任务的雅尔塔协定和波茨坦协定；它也明显地违反了其他的现行协定以及美、英、法、苏四国在德国问题上所承担的庄严义务。美、英、法三国政府破坏了这些协定和义务，走上了充满危险和冒险的道路，并打算把整个欧洲都拉到这条路上去。
    伦敦和巴黎协定威胁和平和欧洲各国人民的生活。它是建立军事侵略集团政策的体现，是战争和侵略政策的化身。尽管有人说，武装西德和使它加入军事集团为西方国家“防务”所必需，那也是掩盖不了使西德重新军国主义化的真正目的的。
    这种说法迷惑不了任何人。历史证明：德国军国主义一向是侵略的因素，而不是防御的因素。建立所谓“欧洲军”的目的是，根据建立由美国和西欧国家组成的排他性军事集团的计划，复活西德“国防军”作为反对苏联和人民民主国家的突击力量。
    批准巴黎协定，就会使得和平解决德国问题以建立一个统一、民主、和平的德国这一任务变得困难起来，也就是说，这就会永久使德国分裂成为两部分，就会出现对欧洲和平的经常威胁。批准巴黎协定。就会在欧洲造成严重的威胁，因为复活德国军国主义和使西德参加如西欧联盟和北大西洋集团这样的军事集团，就会给欧洲和平造成直接的威胁，就会大大增加发动欧洲新战争的危险，就会导向新的世界大战。在西德已开始建立武装力量，而军火的生产超出了巴黎协定规定的范围；西德军事工业正在迅速地发展中，美国资本显然参加了西德的军事工业。巴黎协定中固然有限制武装力量和装备的数量和质量的条款，然而波恩统治者的言行证明，这些条款对于德国军国主义者是没有什么作用的。率领新“国防军”的恰恰是在第二次世界大战中统率“国防军”并且对欧洲人民犯下滔天罪行的那些希特勒将领。
    批准巴黎协定将在欧洲中部造成一个新的侵略策源地。这使参加巴黎协定的各国负有重大的责任，并且迫使爱好和平的国家采取保障安全的新措施。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府代表团深信，这次会议将帮助欧洲各国人民明了巴黎协定具有多么大的危险性。希特勒德国在第二次世界大战中的侵略给欧洲各国人民所带来的难忘的苦难和创伤，应使欧洲各国政府和人民决不允许复活德国军国主义——欧洲各国人民和德国人民自由和生活的死敌。他们必须共同努力建立欧洲集体安全体系和加强和平与各国人民的安全。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和阿尔巴尼亚人民支持一切加强欧洲和平与安全的努力，并且反对伦敦协定和巴黎协定，因为这些协定规定西德重新军国主义化并使西德加入某些国家敌视欧洲其他国家的军事集团。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在历史上曾为争取独立、反对外国压迫者进行过不倦的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民被土耳其占领者统治了四百五十年。阿尔巴尼亚在一九一二年摆脱了土耳其的统治，宣布国家独立，但是在一九四四年十一月二十九日以前，阿尔巴尼亚一直再度沦于帝国主义势力的枷锁之下，因此阿尔巴尼亚人民只得不顾重大牺牲，拿起武器进行斗争。
    在二十四年当中，德国军队曾两次侵占和蹂躏我们国家。在第二次世界大战时，阿尔巴尼亚成了法西斯侵略的牺牲品。阿尔巴尼亚人民跟反法西斯大同盟中的其他反法西斯各国人民肩并肩地、奋不顾身地和占领者作战六年。第二次世界大战中阿尔巴尼亚人民所遭到的损失，跟其他欧洲国家比较，是相当大的：二万八千八百人死亡，一万二千六百人受伤，残废和被关在监狱和集中营的有一万二千
  一百五十人。全国乡村和城市的百分之三十五被烧毁。阿尔巴尼亚所遭受的物质损失为十亿美元左右
  （按一九三八年外汇折算）。
    自从阿尔巴尼亚在它自己许多世纪的历史中第一次永远地成为自由的阿尔巴尼亚时开始，已经十年了。阿尔巴尼亚人民第一次成为真正自由的人民，成为自己国家的主人。阿尔巴尼亚人民再也不受压迫者的压迫，他们在建设自己幸福和富裕的新生活。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国是真正爱好和平的国家。在历史上，阿尔巴尼亚从来没有进攻过其他国家。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国整个外交政策和国内政策都体现了阿尔巴尼亚人民和它的政府维护和巩固巴尔干半岛和欧洲和平的意志和努力。
    在国内，进行不断增进人民物质和文化福利的和平建设；在平等、互相尊重独立和国家主权、互相尊重领土完整和互利的基础上与一切其他国家建立正常的关系、友谊和真诚合作，这就是阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的政策。
    过去，阿尔巴尼亚是孤立无援的，是我们国家和我国人民的那些死敌——外国帝国主义者的小筹码。现在的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国是一个自由、民主和有主权的国家；现在的阿尔巴尼亚人民不是孤立的，他们有着一些强大可靠的朋友——以苏联为首的强大的和平社会主义阵营的各兄弟国家人民和他们在一起。阿尔巴尼亚人民决不让历史重演，而且历史也绝不可能重演。
    我们代表团代表阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府表示完全同意苏联代表团团长莫洛托夫同志对目前国际形势的估计，并表示赞同他所提出的关于保卫和巩固欧洲和平和安全以及我们这些国家安全的建议。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表团同样地完全同意波兰人民共和国部长会议主席西伦凯维兹同志、捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基同志和德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥同志关于保障我们这些国家的安全和欧洲和平的问题的意见。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国将始终如一地继续执行建设性的和平政策以及巩固和苏联、中华人民共和国及其他人民民主国家的兄弟关系的政策。我们愿意和参加这次会议的其他国家一起贡献出全部力量，并且愿意采取保卫欧洲和平和安全的必要措施。
    巴黎协定一旦批准，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府还准备和参加这次会议的国家一起在军事方面采取具体的集体措施，以保卫我们各国人民的创造性和平劳动，保障我们各国边境的不可侵犯，抵御任何侵略。
    我们表示：我国政府和我国人民完全相信，这次会议是对保卫和巩固欧洲和平和安全事业的有价值的重大贡献。参加这次会议的各爱好和平的欧洲国家的政府充分认识到，按照伦敦和巴黎协定复活西德武装力量并使西德加入侵略性的西方军事集团，是对全欧和平和安全事业、特别是对我们这些国家的威胁。他们也充分意识到，欧洲各国必须以配合的行动来维护和巩固欧洲和平和安全。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府代表团将竭尽全力使我们这次会议能胜利地达成符合欧洲各国人民的愿望和利益的目标。
