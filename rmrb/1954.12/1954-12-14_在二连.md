    At Erenhot
    By our reporter Lin Mo

    The first direct train on the Jining-Ulaanbaatar railway's Jier section arrived at Erenhot station on December 12th. This reminds me of the days and nights I spent with the railway construction workers in Erenhot.
    At dusk, the workers of the mechanized road construction team finished their day's work, and everyone walked back to their tents from the construction site. The fiery red sun sank from the grassland, and a glow rose in the west. As people walked along the way, they looked at the tall water tower at the newly built station on the side of the Mongolian People's Republic across the border. The dome of the water tower became blurred in the dusk, gradually disappearing into the darkness. Then, a patch of starlight-like lights appeared in this place.
    This is a vast grassland. There is nothing particularly eye-catching on the border. Although the workers from China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia who are building the railway have emotional connections, they cannot cross the border and interact with each other at will. That visible water tower and the lights have become a sign of friendship between people. Early in the morning, we Erenhot railway construction workers looked at the water tower shrouded in the morning mist in the north, as if to say good morning to friends over there. When working, people think in their hearts: When can we lay the rails to Erenhot; when can the worker brothers of the three countries meet here intimately and connect the tracks together. After finishing a day’s work, at night when going to bed, people bid farewell to the lights opposite.
      But whenever night falls, people watch the lights on the opposite side light up, knowing that the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People’s Republic's worker brothers have started night work, while their own construction site is in complete darkness and there is no movement. People reveal a kind of unease in their hearts: It seems that the other party has extended a hand of friendship to themselves, but they cannot answer him.
    When the workers of the Erenhot mechanized road construction team heard the news of the Sino-Soviet talks, everyone could no longer bear it. Tractor drivers did not stop work when it got dark, and continued to work by moonlight, and everyone put forward the slogan: "The machine follows the moon!" After working like this for a few nights, seeing that the moonlight was no longer sufficient, they requested that electric lights be installed at the construction site for night construction. The engineering bureau approved the workers' request. For several days in a row, everyone was preparing nervously. The generator for lighting, which the higher-ups had allocated, was originally said to arrive on October 19. After eating breakfast on this day, the workers looked south, and waited until dark without seeing it arrive. It turned out that the car had broken down in the desert and was delayed by a day, and the workers were so anxious. On the 20th, when the workers were about to eat dinner, they saw the car transporting the electric poles, and everyone put down their bowls and picked up one pole each, and in no time, dozens of electric poles were planted. By the 21st, the lights and wires were all installed. When work was over in the evening, the tractors did not drive back from the construction site. After the drivers got off work, the repairmen were busy checking the machines, just waiting for the lights to turn on to start night construction. The workers were so excited that it was evident on everyone's faces, and they ate and walked especially fast.
    Unexpectedly, at this moment, a water shortage suddenly broke out in the team. On the 21st, the water truck broke down, and the first and third divisions of the mechanized road construction team had no water for a day. First, the two divisions adjusted their water usage with each other, and then they went to other work areas eight or ten miles away to borrow water. Not only did hundreds of people need to drink, but dozens of tractors also needed water, and the extra water nearby was quickly borrowed. On the afternoon of the 21st, the first division used the last two buckets of water to steam steamed buns, and even the pot was boiled dry. Everyone could only eat them dry, and they couldn't even drink a mouthful of water from the steaming pot.
    The workers who build roads on the grassland are used to water shortages. People can still work as usual without drinking water for a day, but machines cannot do without water for a moment. One of the tractors in the first division ran out of water when it returned to the team from the construction site, and barely drove to the entrance of the third division before stopping there and being unable to move another step.
    Because the third division was going to carry out night construction, the workers proposed to leave water for the machines to use. The cooks tried to save water, and the workers felt that every sip they drank was very precious.
    The team's cadres were very anxious about this situation. In the evening, Wang Shurun, the political commissar of the brigade headquarters, was busy calling the higher authorities, shouting himself hoarse and sweating on his head. He requested that the higher authorities allocate a water truck to come and support them overnight. The phone was sometimes interrupted in the middle, and he waited anxiously, lighting a cigarette in his hand, and then putting it down again. Several people stood quietly beside him, and no one spoke.
    While everyone was waiting for the phone call, a worker ran in breathlessly and whispered something in the ear of Qiao Shiduo, the chairman of the labor union. Qiao Shiduo's face immediately turned pale. Everyone in the tent ran out together upon hearing the news.
    What happened? A pile of people outside were clamoring around the generator. It turned out that the generator had been damaged.
    These days, Sun Jianping, the captain of the third division, had been muttering about the generator in his dreams at night. He was more anxious than anyone else when the generator was delayed by a day. After it was delivered and found to be faulty, he went to see it countless times a day while it was being repaired. After it was repaired, he wanted to move it to the construction site, but he didn't trust others to do it, so he did it himself. People are prone to negligence when they are nervous and excited. When he started the crane and lifted the generator to put it on the truck, he accidentally dropped the crane boom and hit the generator. At that time, Sun Jianping jumped off the crane and rushed over, shouting repeatedly: "Oh dear, oh dear, is it broken? Did it hit anyone?" He walked around the generator, his face dripping with sweat, and trembling with pain. Hitting the generator was like hitting his heart.
    A crowd of people immediately gathered around, but no one could figure out how badly the generator was damaged. Someone had already run to find Captain Ma. Ma Jihe, the assistant captain of the mechanized road construction team, was very familiar with the generator. He had been busy all day fixing the generator, and then went to the construction site to check the wires. As soon as he heard that something had happened to the generator, he hurried back, and when he arrived, he only cared about checking the generator, and didn't bother to ask about the cause of the accident. Everyone looked at him, holding their breath. The result of the inspection: there was no internal damage to the generator, only the water tank cover was dented, which did not hinder normal operation. People finally breathed a sigh of relief.
    A group of workers carefully transported the generator to the construction site as if they were carrying a pot of flowers. The generator started up with a sputtering sound, and a blaze of lights suddenly lit up on the dark grassland, and people burst into enthusiastic cheers. Looking from here at the lights on the construction site of the Mongolian People’s Republic across the border, people said with satisfaction: "In the past, we looked at them every night, now the two of us are looking at each other."
    At night, machine repair worker Wu Jiayin was on night shift at the construction site. He squatted in a tent, looking after the sputtering generator at the door. The tent was temporary, with nothing inside, and the ground was cold sand. He was wearing a leather jacket, but he couldn't withstand the cold of the late-night grassland, and his legs were numb with cold. In the first half of the night, a tractor had a minor problem, which he fixed, but no one came to him in the second half of the night. There was nothing to do, and he was sleepy, but suddenly he heard the generator outside making an abnormal noise. He was startled and woke up, and quickly went outside to check. It turned out that the generator's throttle had been shaken open.
    The gray dawn appeared on the grassland, the day shift workers arrived at the construction site, and the night shift workers were handing over. This night, everyone did enough work to top a day’s work. This night, worker Cai Luoliang drove a tractor and drove fifty or sixty miles to haul back a load of water, allowing everyone to have a comfortable breakfast and get through the water shortage.

    在二连
    本报记者　林沫
    集宁—乌兰巴托铁路集二段的第一趟直达列车，已在十二月十二日到达二连车站。这使我想起我和二连的筑路职工在一起度过的那几个白天和夜晚。
    黄昏，机械筑路队的工人作完了一天的工作，大家从工地走回帐篷去，火红的太阳从草原上沉没下去了，西边烧起一片晚霞。人们一路走着，遥望着国境那边蒙古人民共和国新修起的车站上那高高的水塔。水塔的圆顶在黄昏中变得模糊起来，渐渐隐没在黑暗中了。接着，这地方又出现了一片像星星样的灯光。
    这儿是茫茫的草原，在国境线上没有特别引人注意的东西。中、苏、蒙三国修筑铁路的职工们虽然感情相通，但却不能随便越过国境，互相交往。那望得见的水塔和灯光就成了人们友谊的标志。清早起来，我们在二连的筑路职工就望望北边那被晨雾缭绕着的水塔，像是和那边的朋友道声早安。工作的时候，人们就在心里盘算着：我们什么时候可以铺轨到二连；什么时候，三个国家的工人弟兄可以在这里亲热地会面，把路轨连接在一起。干完了一天的工作，到夜晚睡觉的时候，人们又和对面的灯光告别。
      但每当夜晚，人们望着对面那一片灯光亮起来，知道苏联和蒙古人民共和国的工人兄弟又开始夜间工作，而自己的工地上却是一片黑夜，毫无动静的时候，人们就流露出一种不安的心情：好像对方向自己伸出了友谊的手，而自己却无法回答他。
    当二连机械化筑路队的职工们听到中苏会谈公报的消息后，大家再也忍耐不住了。拖拉机手们天黑也不收工，就借月光继续干起来，大家提出口号：“机器跟月亮走！”这样干了几个夜晚，眼看月光不行了，就要求在工地安装电灯，进行夜间施工。工程局批准了职工的要求。接连几天，人人都在紧张地进行准备。上级给调拨的照明用的发电机，原说十月十九日就要到的，这天吃过早饭工人就往南望，一直望到天黑也没见来，原来是汽车在沙漠上抛了锚，迟到了一天，工人就急得不行。二十日这天，工人快要吃晚饭了，一见汽车把电线杆子运到了，大家放下饭碗，一人扛起一根，一刻工夫就把几十根电杆栽好了。到二十一日这天，电灯、电线都安装好了，晚上收工时，拖拉机就没有从工地往回开，驾驶人员下了班，修理人员就忙着检查机器，单等着电灯一亮，就开始夜间施工了。工人那股兴奋劲儿，个个脸色上都看得出来，吃饭、走路都特别快。
    不料这当儿，队上却突然闹起水荒。二十一日这天，运水的汽车出了毛病，机械筑路队一、三两个分队一天都没来水。先是两个分队互相调剂着用水，后来又到附近十里、八里别的工区去借。他们不光几百人吃喝，几十架拖拉机还要用，附近多余的水很快也被借光了。二十一日这天中午，一分队用最后的两桶水蒸了馒头，连锅都熬干了，大家只能干吃，连口蒸锅水也喝不上。
    在草原上修路的职工们，对水荒本已习惯了，人一天不喝水还可以照样工作，但机器离了水却一刻也不行。一分队有一架拖拉机，从工地回队时断了水，勉强开到三分队门口，就停在那里一步也不能动了。
    三分队因为要进行夜间施工，职工们纷纷提出要留下水给机器使用，炊事员想法节省水，工人们连喝一口都觉得十分珍贵。
    队上的干部对这情况十分着急，晚上，大队部政治委员王书润忙着给上级要电话，把嗓子都喊哑了，头上冒着热汗。他要求上级调拨一辆水车，连夜赶来支援。电话有时在中途被打断了，他焦急地等待着，手上刚燃起一支烟，又把它放下。旁边有几个人静静站在那里，谁也不说话。
    大家正在等电话，一个工友气喘吁吁地跑进来，爬在工会主席乔士铎耳边低声说了句什么。乔士铎脸上立时变得刷白。帐篷里的人听到这消息，一齐跑出去了。
    出了什么事情呢？外边一堆人在围着发电机嚷嚷，原来是发电机被打坏了。
    这几天，三分队队长孙建平夜里作梦都在念叨发电机。发电机迟了一天没运到，他比谁都着急。运来之后发现有毛病，修理的时候，他一天去看无数遍。修理好之后，要往工地搬运，别人干他不放心，他亲自下手。人在紧张和兴奋的时候容易疏忽，当他开动吊车，吊起发电机往车上放的时候，一个不小心，吊车杆子落下来打住了发电机。当时孙建平跳下吊车扑过去，连声喊着：“唉呀呀，唉呀呀，打坏了没有？打到人没有？”他围着发电机转来转去，脸上汗直流，痛苦得浑身发抖，打了发电机，就好像打在他的心窝上。
    一时围了一堆人，但谁也摸不清发电机坏的轻重。旁边早有人跑去找马队长去了。机械筑路队的助理队长马继何对发电机很熟悉，他白天忙了一天，才把发电机检修好，又到工地去检查电线。他
  一听说发电机出了事，就赶快往回跑，到了跟前，只顾查看发电机，连事故的原因也顾不得细问了。大家望着他，心里捏一把冷汗。检查的结果：发电机内部没有损坏，只有水箱盖被打凹下去一块，并不妨碍正常的运转。人们这才轻松地出了一口气。
    一群工人照扶着，像运送一盆鲜花一样，把发电机运到了工地。发电机发出突突的响声开动起来，漆黑的草原上突然亮起一片灯光，人们发出一阵热烈的欢呼。等待已久的拖拉机驾驶手们立即发动了机器，拖着一架架的铲运机，轰轰隆隆地在草原上行动起来。人们从这里望着国境那边蒙古人民共和国工地上那一片灯光，满意地说：“过去咱们每晚望着人家，现在是两家互相望着了。”
    夜里，机械修理工吴甲寅在工地值夜班。他蹲在一座帐篷里，照管门口那架突突转动的发电机。帐篷是临时搭起的，里边什么也没有，地下是冷冰的沙子。他穿着皮衣，也抵不住草原上深夜的寒冷，两腿都冻得麻木了。前半夜有架拖拉机发生了点小毛病，他给修理好了，后半夜就再没有人找他。没有什么活干，他困得要睡了，但突然听到外边发电机的声音响得不正常，心里一惊，就清醒过来，赶快到外面去检查，原来是发电机的油门被震动得开大了。
    草原上显出灰白色的黎明，日班的工人来到了工地，夜班的工人在交班了。这一夜，大家干的活足足顶上白天。这一夜，工人蔡洛亮开上拖拉机，跑了五、六十里路拉回一趟水，使大家舒舒服服地吃上一顿早饭，度过了水荒。
