    Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy and Prohibition of Atomic Weapons
    Li Yanning

    The discovery of atomic energy is a great achievement of human civilization. It is the common and deep desire of people all over the world that this great discovery be used solely for peaceful purposes, for the benefit of mankind, and not for the manufacture of weapons for the large-scale slaughter of humanity. The Soviet Union has waged continuous struggles in the Soviet-American atomic energy negotiations and in the discussions of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, precisely to realize this desire of the people of the world.

    There are two fundamentally different attitudes on the peaceful application of atomic energy. One attitude is to advocate the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, so that atomic energy is only used for peaceful purposes. This is the attitude taken by the Soviet Union. Obviously, only by blocking the path of using atomic energy for war can the peaceful application of atomic energy be developed on a large scale and rapidly.

    Over the years, the Soviet Union has been striving to reach an international agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons with this attitude. At the same time, the Soviet Union has been actively applying atomic energy to industry, agriculture, biology and medicine. On June 27, 1954, the world's first atomic power station, created by the Soviet Union, began generating electricity, setting an example for the peaceful application of atomic energy for the whole world.

    The attitude of the U.S. ruling group is completely different. What they are concerned about with atomic energy is using it as a tool for blackmail, aggression, and seizing world hegemony. They are extremely reluctant to prohibit atomic weapons; on the contrary, they are obsessed with mass production and stockpiling of atomic weapons. Precisely because of this, although the United States was the first country to manufacture the atomic bomb, it has not achieved anything worth mentioning in the peaceful application of atomic energy up to now. The U.S. ruling group has also made empty talk about the peaceful application of atomic energy, but it has always tried to avoid linking it to the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons.

    U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on December 8, 1953, suggesting that the governments concerned should jointly donate some atomic materials to an international atomic energy agency for peaceful purposes. At this year's United Nations General Assembly, the United States, Britain, France, Canada and four other countries jointly proposed the establishment of this international agency and the convening of an international technical conference on the peaceful application of atomic energy. The U.S. ruling group mobilized all its propaganda machines to vigorously promote Eisenhower's proposal and the seven-nation proposal, calling it a major "contribution" to world peace.

    However, this propaganda cannot conceal the essence and true purpose of this proposal and suggestion. Eisenhower's suggestion, as pointed out in the Soviet government's statement on December 21, 1953, completely avoids the most fundamental issue in the atomic energy problem—the prohibition of atomic weapons. It neither helps to stop the production of atomic weapons, nor does it limit the possibility of using atomic weapons in the slightest.

    The seven-nation proposal is a step backward compared to Eisenhower's speech. Eisenhower's speech also vaguely talked about reducing the "potential destructive power of the world's atomic stockpile," but this point is not mentioned at all in the seven-nation proposal; the check opened by Eisenhower's speech—the international atomic energy agency to "provide sufficient electricity to areas of the world lacking electricity"—cannot be found at all in the seven-nation proposal; the scale of international cooperation in the peaceful application of atomic energy has also been reduced in the seven-nation proposal.

    From the time Eisenhower made his suggestion, the Soviet government has solemnly pointed out the fundamental shortcoming of this suggestion, which avoids talking about the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons. The Soviet Union conducted negotiations with the United States on the atomic energy issue, raised key questions in the negotiations, suggested to the U.S. government that the countries concerned should conclude an agreement to unconditionally undertake the obligation not to use atomic weapons, and also advocated discussing this issue simultaneously with Eisenhower's suggestion. During the ten-month negotiation process, the United States has always adopted a negative attitude towards this Soviet suggestion. The United States also attempted to use the situation of secret negotiations to deceive world public opinion, insisting that the Soviet Union was unwilling to participate in international cooperation in the peaceful application of atomic energy. However, after the documents exchanged between the two sides in the negotiations were published according to the Soviet proposal, this distorted propaganda was declared bankrupt.

    At this session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Soviet representative clearly stated that the Soviet Union warmly welcomes international cooperation in the peaceful application of atomic energy. At the same time, the Soviet Union emphasized that the peaceful and military aspects of the use of atomic energy must not be regarded as two unrelated fields. The speech by the Soviet representative powerfully reminded the people of the world: we must not forget the danger that most atomic materials are still being used to manufacture weapons without hindrance just because we have begun to study the issue of using a small part of atomic materials for peaceful purposes. The Soviet Union proposed amendments to address this fundamental shortcoming of the seven-nation proposal, which made it impossible for U.S. representative Lodge to deny the importance of the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons, and had to amend the seven-nation proposal to include a clause: "The General Assembly hopes to greatly promote atomic energy for one purpose: only to serve human peace efforts and improve human living standards."

    The Soviet representative also exposed other major shortcomings of the seven-nation proposal. The Soviet representative pointed out that the seven-nation proposal's attempt to make the relationship between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations the same as the relationship between the United Nations and its specialized agencies is unreasonable. The Soviet representative emphasized that this agency must be established on the principle that no country should have the privilege of imposing its will on other countries. The amendment proposed by the Soviet Union advocated that the agency be responsible to the United Nations General Assembly, and to the Security Council in certain circumstances stipulated in the United Nations Charter. The Soviet Union also opposed the U.S. attempt to exclude certain countries from the upcoming international scientific conference, and proposed an amendment advocating welcoming the participation of all countries. The United States and other countries unreasonably rejected these two amendments from the Soviet Union, but had to delete the provisions on the relationship between the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations from the seven-nation proposal, which was the same as that of specialized agencies.

    These struggles of the Soviet Union on the issue of the peaceful application of atomic energy are of great significance. It has made the people of the world more aware of the true key to the issue of the peaceful application of atomic energy, making it impossible for the U.S. ruling group to implement its tricks of deceiving the people of the world. The Soviet Union's suggestion points out a clear path for the struggle of people all over the world to strive for the prohibition of atomic weapons.

      It is not without reason that the U.S. ruling group, which has always clamored for atomic warfare, has recently shown concern for the issue of the peaceful application of atomic energy. The Washington "policy of strength" adherents attempted to wave atomic weapons to intimidate and provoke the peace and democracy camp, but failed to achieve their goal. Its so-called advantage in atomic and hydrogen weapons no longer exists, and the clamor for atomic warfare not only does not help U.S. diplomatic speculation, but also arouses the anger and condemnation of the broad masses of people in the world. In particular, the Soviet Union's leading use of atomic energy for peaceful construction has put U.S. decision-makers in an extremely unfavorable predicament. Therefore, they urgently need to find a cover to carry out the atomic arms race.

    Facts have proved that the U.S. ruling group has not abandoned its atomic militarism policy. The U.S. government's budget for 1954-1955 for the manufacture of atomic weapons reached an unprecedented huge amount of 2,425 million U.S. dollars. Just two months after Eisenhower made his suggestion, he personally ordered an increase in the production of hydrogen bombs. Does this act of desperately expanding atomic armaments not contradict the U.S. expression of willingness to develop the peaceful uses of atomic energy?

    People cannot help but see that the huge profits of U.S. monopoly capital in the production of atomic weapons are dominating this U.S. policy. The huge atomic industry is funded by the government, but is actually controlled by a small handful of large monopoly capitalists such as Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon, and DuPont, and brings them huge profits. U.S. monopoly capitalists even regard the production of atomic weapons as a tool to help them alleviate the economic crisis. The U.S. hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Island aroused protests from peace-loving people all over the world, but the mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capitalists, "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, couldn't help but say in an article entitled "What the Hydrogen Bomb Means to Business": "It is beginning to have far-reaching—and strange—commercial repercussions... orders for strategic materials have increased... the foreseeable result is an increase in business activity." Therefore, people all over the world will never relax their struggle to demand the prohibition of atomic weapons just because the U.S. ruling group pretends to be concerned about the peaceful application of atomic energy.

    The plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly adopted the draft resolution of the Political Committee on international cooperation in promoting the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes on December 4. The entire process of the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of this issue showed the sincere and significant efforts made by the Soviet Union to promote international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. Soviet representative Sobolev pointed out at the plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that the Soviet delegation's vote in favor of the entire proposal was to agree to the principle of implementing international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy, which the Soviet Union has always adhered to. However, this does not mean agreeing to some of the provisions in the proposal that attempt to narrow the scope of international cooperation and create difficulties for the development of international cooperation. The Soviet delegation requested that some issues in international cooperation be further considered in the future negotiations of the countries concerned.

    Time will further show how sincere the United States and its Western partners are in implementing international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    和平利用原子能和禁止原子武器
    李延宁
    原子能的发现是人类文明的伟大成就。把这一伟大的发现只用于和平用途，为人类谋福利，不是用来制造大规模地屠杀人类的武器，是全世界人民一致的深切愿望。苏联在苏美原子能谈判中，在联合国大会本届会议关于在原子能和平用途方面的国际合作问题的讨论中，曾进行了不断的斗争，就是为了实现全世界人民的这种愿望。
    在原子能的和平应用问题上有两种根本不同的态度。一种态度是：主张无条件禁止原子武器，使原子能只用于和平用途。这就是苏联所采取的态度。很显然，只有把原子能用于战争的道路加以堵塞，才可能使原子能的和平应用得到大规模的、迅速的进展。
    历年来，苏联正是抱着这种态度，努力谋求达成禁止原子武器的国际协议。同时，苏联并已积极把原子能应用于工业、农业、生物和医学上面。一九五四年六月二十七日，苏联创建的世界上第一个原子能发电站开始发电，给全世界树立了和平应用原子能的榜样。
    美国统治集团的态度却是完全不同的。他们对于原子能所关心的，是把它作为进行讹诈、侵略和攫取世界霸权的工具。他们极不愿意禁止原子武器，相反地却醉心于大量制造和囤积原子武器。正是因为这样，美国虽然是第一个制造原子弹的国家，在和平应用原子能方面却到现在还没有什么可以说得上的成就。美国统治集团也曾经空谈原子能的和平应用，但总是竭力规避联系到禁止原子武器的问题。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔一九五三年十二月八日在联合国大会上发表了一个演说，建议有关各国政府共同捐出一些原子物资给一个国际原子能机构，来用于和平用途。在今年的联合国大会上，美国和英、法、加拿大等七国又共同就成立这个国际机构和召开关于原子能和平应用的国际技术会议提出一个提案。美国统治集团动员了所有它的宣传机构大吹大擂地为艾森豪威尔的建议和七国提案捧场，把它说成是对人类和平的一大“贡献”。
    但是，这种宣传掩盖不了这个建议和提案的实质和真正目的。艾森豪威尔的建议，正如苏联政府一九五三年十二月二十一日的声明中所指出的，完全没有触及原子能问题中最根本的问题——禁止原子武器问题，它既不能有助于制止原子武器的生产，也丝毫没有限制使用原子武器的可能性。
    七国提案比起艾森豪威尔的演说来更后退了一步。艾森豪威尔演说中还曾经空洞地谈到要减少
  “世界原子储藏的潜在毁灭力”，而在七国提案中这点却根本不提了；艾森豪威尔演说中开出的一张支票——国际原子能机构要“对世界上缺乏电力的地区提供充足的电力”，在七国提案中也根本找不到了；在原子能和平应用方面的国际合作的规模上，七国提案也加以缩小。
    苏联政府从艾森豪威尔提出建议的时候开始，就严正地指出了这个建议避而不谈禁止原子武器问题的根本性缺点。苏联同美国就原子能问题进行了谈判，在谈判中提出关键性问题，向美国政府建议有关各国缔结协议无条件承担不使用原子武器的义务，并且主张同时讨论这个问题和艾森豪威尔的建议。在十个月的谈判过程中，美国对苏联这一建议一直采取了否定的态度。美国并且企图利用秘密谈判的情况来蒙蔽世界舆论，硬说苏联不愿参加原子能和平应用方面的国际合作。但是，在根据苏联的提议公布了双方在谈判中互相交换的文件以后，这种歪曲宣传就宣告破产了。
    在联合国大会本届会议上，苏联代表清楚地表明苏联热烈欢迎在原子能和平应用方面进行国际合作，苏联同时着重指出，决不能把原子能用途的和平方面和军事方面看作互不相关的两个领域。苏联代表的发言有力地提醒了全世界人民：不能因为开始研究把一小部分原子物资用于和平用途的问题，就忘记了大部分原子物资仍然毫无阻碍地被用来制造武器的危险。苏联针对七国提案这种根本缺点提出了修正案，使得美国代表洛奇无法否认禁止原子武器问题的重要性，并且不得不修正了七国提案，使提案中包括了这样一个条款：“大会希望大力促进原子能用于一个目的：只是为人类和平努力服务和提高人类生活水平”。
    苏联代表同时揭露了七国提案的其他重大缺点。苏联代表指出，七国提案企图使国际原子能机构同联合国的关系和联合国各专门机构同联合国的关系一样，是不合理的。苏联代表强调指出，这个机构必须依据这样一个原则建立：任何一国决不能在其中有能够把自己的意志强加于他国的特权地位。苏联提出的修正案主张这个机构对联合国大会负责，在联合国宪章所规定的若干情况下并且对安全理事会负责。苏联也反对美国想在将要召开的国际科学会议中排斥某些国家的企图，提出了主张欢迎一切国家参加的修正案。美国等国家无理地拒绝了苏联这两个修正案，但是也不得不在七国提案中删去关于国际原子能机构同联合国的关系和专门机构相同的规定。
    苏联在原子能和平应用问题上的这些斗争，是有重大意义的。它使世界人民更加认清了原子能和平应用问题的真正关键所在，使得美国统治集团欺骗世界人民的伎俩无法施展。苏联的建议，为全世界人民争取禁止原子武器的斗争，指出了明确的道路。
      一向穷凶极恶地叫嚣原子战争的美国统治集团近来表现出关心和平应用原子能问题的样子，并不是没有原故的。华盛顿的“实力政策”奉行者企图挥舞原子武器来向和平民主阵营进行恫吓和挑衅，但是并没有能达到目的，它的所谓原子和氢武器的优势也早就不存在了，而原子战争的叫嚣不但无助于美国外交上的投机，反而引起了世界广大人民的愤怒和谴责。特别是苏联率先将原子能用于和平建设事业，这就更使美国的决策者陷于极端不利的窘境。因此他们就迫切需要找到一种掩护来进行原子军备竞赛。
    事实证明，美国统治集团并没有放弃原子黩武政策。美国政府一九五四——一九五五年度预算中用于制造原子武器的拨款达到了二十四亿二千五百万美元的空前巨额。就在艾森豪威尔提出他的建议以后两个月，他还亲自下令增加氢弹的生产。这种拚命扩张原子军备的作法，难道不是和美国表示愿意发展原子能的和平用途的姿态相矛盾的吗？
    人们也不能不看到：美国垄断资本在原子武器的生产中的巨额利润在支配着美国这种政策。庞大的原子工业由政府出资，实际上却掌握在摩根、洛克斐勒、梅隆和杜邦等一小撮大垄断资本家的手中，并为他们带来巨额的利润。美国垄断资本家甚至把原子武器的生产当做帮助他们缓和经济危机的工具。美国在比基尼岛的氢弹试验曾激起了全世界爱好和平的人民的抗议，但是美国垄断资本家的喉舌“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志却在一篇“氢弹对企业意味着什么”的文章中情不自禁地说：“这开始在商业上发生深远的——并且是奇异的——反响……战略物资的订货单增加了……结果可以预料得到的是商业活动的增加。”因此，全世界人民绝对不会因为美国统治集团作出关心和平应用原子能问题的样子就松懈了要求禁止原子武器的斗争。
    联合国大会全体会议已于十二月四日通过了政治委员会关于在促进原子能用于和平目的方面进行国际合作的决议草案。联合国大会讨论这个问题的整个过程，显示了苏联对于促成和平利用原子能的国际合作方面所作的真诚而重大的努力。苏联代表索波列夫在联大全体会上曾经指出，苏联代表团投票赞成整个提案，就是同意在和平利用原子能方面实行国际合作的原则，而这个原则是苏联始终不渝地坚持的。但是，这并不等于同意提案中力图缩小国际合作范围和对发展国际合作造成困难的一些条款。苏联代表团要求在今后各有关国家谈判的过程中进一步来考虑国际合作中的一些问题。
    时间将会进一步表明，美国及其西方伙伴究竟在和平利用原子能实行国际合作上有几分诚意。
