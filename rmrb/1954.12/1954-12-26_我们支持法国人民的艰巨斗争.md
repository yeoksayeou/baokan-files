    We Support the Arduous Struggle of the French People

    After fierce debate, the French National Assembly, on December 24th, rejected the protocol for the rearmament of West Germany within the framework of the "Western European Union" by 280 votes to 259. This reflects the preliminary achievement of the French people's resolute struggle, with the support of peace-loving forces worldwide, against the ratification of the Paris Agreements. The U.S. and British governments are feeling very "uneasy" about this. They are using the most brutal pressure to interfere in French internal affairs, attempting to impose the Paris Agreements for the armament of West Germany, which have already been rejected by the French National Assembly, on the French people. This is intolerable to peace-loving people around the world, and especially to the French people.
    The serious danger to French security and the interests of European peace posed by the Paris Agreements, whose main purpose is to revive the forces of German militarism, is already well known. In the French National Assembly's debate, the speeches of French Communist Party members and other patriotic parliamentarians further exposed the criminal essence of the Paris Agreements. As French Communist parliamentarian Duclos pointed out: Ratification of the Paris Agreements would deepen the grave threat of war in Europe and elsewhere in the world. French Radical Socialist Party leaders Herriot and Daladier, Independent Republican parliamentarian Omayran, Gaullist parliamentarian Soustelle, and others also pointed out in their speeches the dangerous consequences of allowing the reconstruction of the German "Bundeswehr," and unanimously agreed that the rearmament of West Germany is American policy, Dulles' policy. Soustelle asked in parliament: "What is the reason for rearming Germany? It is because the United States wants it." It is known that before the Second World War, it was precisely American gold that fostered Hitler's aggressive forces, the result of which was France's humiliation under Hitler's iron heel and the unparalleled disaster suffered by the French people and the people of other European countries. Only a little more than nine years after the defeat of Hitler's fascism, American monopoly capital, which in the past helped Hitler's bandits prepare for and launch the Second World War, is now very powerful within the U.S. government. They are doing everything possible to revive the common enemy of the French people and the people of other European countries—German militarism—in order to prepare for and launch a Third World War. Under this sinister plan, it will not be others who suffer first, but France, which has been invaded three times by the German "Bundeswehr" since 1870. The lessons of history are not far away. Can patriotic French people allow the German "Bundeswehr" to invade France for a fourth time?
    If France ratifies this war agreement that the United States is attempting to impose on the French people, then the fate that the United States has prepared for France will be far more than simply enabling German militarism to invade France once again, and will cause even greater harm. It is enough to point out that the Paris Agreements will allow the rearmed German "Bundeswehr" to possess atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons, and the aggressive German militarism will have no scruples about using these weapons. French Socialist parliamentarian Mocquet pointed out such a danger in his speech to parliament, saying, "I would like to use a broader disarmament agreement to make this agreement (referring to the Paris Agreements) useless." This sentiment expressed by the French National Assembly is perfectly understandable.
    The French people and all patriotic forces in France fully recognize the fatal threat that the revival of German militarism could pose to France. More than three months ago, the French people and patriotic French figures, with great unity, caused the French National Assembly to reject the "European Defense Community" plan. Now they have launched an even more resolute struggle to overthrow the disguised plan to rearm West Germany—the Paris Agreements. In the past two months, approximately 3.5 million people in sixty-seven provinces of France have signed protests against the militarization of West Germany. The French people have also continuously held various rallies, demonstrations, and strikes against the ratification of the Paris Agreements. After the French National Assembly began debating the issue of ratifying the Paris Agreements, people from all over France sent more than a thousand delegations to Paris to petition the National Assembly, demanding the rejection of the sinister Paris Agreements. This indomitable spirit of struggle of the French people fully demonstrates their great patriotic enthusiasm and their firm determination to oppose war, defend peace, and ensure security, which cannot but move anyone with a conscience. Many members of the French National Assembly have been influenced by the firm will of the people. Independent Republican parliamentarian Crozier, after receiving visits from fifty delegations, said, "I have been defeated by the power of public opinion. I will vote against it." The French National Assembly's decision to reject the protocol for the rearmament of West Germany is precisely the result of the persistent struggle of the French people and all patriotic forces in France.
    The French National Assembly's action in rejecting the protocol for the rearmament of West Germany is undoubtedly a significant blow to the plan of the U.S.-British bloc, especially the American aggressive forces, to revive German militarism and prepare for a new war. In this situation, the U.S. and British government authorities are resorting to shameless pressure on the French public and the French National Assembly, and are even blatantly threatening in an attempt to change the decision of the French National Assembly. U.S. President's Press Secretary Hagerty, in an authorized statement, actually said, "We cannot consider this to be the final decision of France on this issue." At the same time, the British Foreign Office also issued a statement saying: "If the Paris Agreements are rejected, it does not mean that the rearmament of Germany will not take place." Obviously, the United States, Britain, and the Mendès-France government, which follows the U.S.-British policy, are unwilling to accept the bankruptcy of their policy of rearming West Germany and are trying to salvage it. At the request of Mendès-France, the French National Assembly will hold a vote of confidence on December 27 regarding the protocol for the rearmament of West Germany and other related issues. This is an important juncture for France's fate. The French people and all patriotic forces in France still face an arduous struggle. The Chinese people warmly welcome the initial achievements of the French people in this struggle, and we firmly support all their efforts to defend their own peace and security. Peace-loving people all over the world are following the struggle of the French people with great enthusiasm and stand with them.

    我们支持法国人民的艰巨斗争
    高集
    法国国民议会经过激烈的辩论之后，在十二月二十四日以二百八十票对二百五十九票否决了在“西欧联盟”范围内重新武装西德的议定书。这反映了法国人民在全世界爱好和平力量的支持下，为反对批准巴黎协定而进行的坚决斗争的初步成就。美、英政府，对此感到十分“不安”。它们正在使用最粗暴的压力来干涉法国内政，企图把已被法国国民议会拒绝了的武装西德的巴黎协定强加在法国人民头上。这是全世界爱好和平人民，特别是法国人民所不能容忍的。
    以复活德国军国主义势力为主旨的巴黎协定，对于法国安全和欧洲和平利益的严重危害性质，已是人所皆知。在法国国民议会的这次辩论中，法国共产党议员和其他爱国议员的发言，更充分揭露了巴黎协定的罪恶实质。正如法共议员杜克洛所指出的：批准巴黎协定，就会加深在欧洲和世界其他地方发生战争的严重威胁。法国激进社会党领袖赫里欧和达拉第、独立共和党议员奥麦朗、戴高乐派议员苏斯戴尔等也都在发言中指出了容许重建德国“国防军”的危险后果，并一致认为重新武装西德是美国的政策，是杜勒斯的政策。苏斯戴尔在议会中问道：“重新武装德国的理由何在呢？这是因为美国希望这样。”人们知道，第二次世界大战以前，也正是美国的金元养大了希特勒的侵略势力，其结果是法国在希特勒铁蹄下的屈辱以及法国人民和欧洲其他各国人民所遭受到的无比的灾难。在希特勒法西斯主义被击败才只九年多的今天，过去曾经帮助希特勒匪徒准备和发动第二次世界大战的美国垄断资本，正在美国政府机构内十分得势。他们千方百计地想使法国人民和欧洲各国人民的共同死敌——德国军国主义复活起来，以便准备和发动第三次世界大战。在这个罪恶计划下首先遭害的将不是别人，而是从一八七○年以来已被德国“国防军”三次侵入过的法国。历史的教训不远，难道爱国的法国人士能够容许德国“国防军”第四次侵入法国吗？
    如果法国批准美国企图强加在法国人民头上的这个战争协定，那么，美国给法国准备的命运将远不止使德国军国主义能够再一次侵入法国，并且要造成更大的危害。只要指出这一点就够了：巴黎协定将容许重新武装起来的德国“国防军”拥有原子武器、化学武器和细菌武器，而侵略成性的德国军国主义对于使用这些武器是不会有任何顾忌的。法国社会党议员莫克就在议会的发言中指出了这样的危险，他说：“我愿意以更广泛的裁军协议来使这个协定（按指巴黎协定）没有用处”。法国国民议会所表现的这种情绪是完全可以理解的。
    法国人民和法国的一切爱国力量充分地认识到复活德国军国主义对法国所可能造成的致命威胁。三个多月以前，法国人民和法国的爱国人士以伟大的团结力量使法国国民议会拒绝了“欧洲防务集团”计划，现在他们又展开了更加坚决的斗争，来推翻改头换面的重新武装西德的计划——巴黎协定。在过去两个月中，在法国的六十七个省中，约有三百五十万人在反对西德军国主义化的抗议书上签了名。法国人民并曾不断举行各种集会、示威和罢工，反对批准巴黎协定。在法国国民议会开始就批准巴黎协定问题进行辩论之后，法国全国各地人民派遣了一千多个代表团赶到巴黎，向国民议会请愿，要求拒绝罪恶的巴黎协定。法国人民这种不屈不挠的斗争精神充分表现了他们伟大的爱国热情，表现了他们反对战争保卫和平和安全的坚定决心，这是任何有良心的人都不能不为之感动的。不少法国国民议会的议员受到了人民的坚决意志的影响。独立共和党的议员克罗齐埃在接见了五十个代表团的访问之后，表示说：“我被舆论的力量击败了。我将投反对票。”法国国民议会否决重新武装西德的议定书的决定，正是法国人民和法国一切爱国力量坚持斗争的结果。
    法国国民议会否决重新武装西德的议定书的行动，无疑是对美英集团，特别是美国侵略势力，复活德国军国主义，准备新战争的计划是一个不轻的打击。在这种情况下，美国和英国政府当局，竟不惜对法国公众和法国国民议会施行无耻的压力，并且露骨威胁以图改变法国国民议会的决定。美国总统的新闻秘书哈格蒂在一个授权发表的声明中，竟然说：“我们不能认为这是法国在这个问题上的最后的决定”。同时，英国的外交部也发表声明说：
  “如果拒绝巴黎协定，并不意味着重新武装德国就不会进行。”显然，美国、英国和追随美英政策的孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府，不甘心于他们重新武装西德政策的破产，正力谋进行挽救。由于孟戴斯—弗朗斯的要求，法国国民议会将于二十七日就重新武装西德的议定书和其他有关问题举行信任投票。这是法国的命运的一个重要关头。法国人民和法国一切爱国力量的面前还有着艰巨的斗争。中国人民热烈欢迎法国人民在这一斗争中的初步成就，我们坚决支持他们为保卫自己的和平和安全所作的一切努力。全世界爱好和平的人民都以极大热情关心着法国人民的斗争，并且和他们站在一起。
