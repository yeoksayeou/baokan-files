    Why are Leaders' Portraits Printed on Stamps?

    Some readers have written to inquire why leaders' portraits are printed on stamps. A brief reply is as follows:

    In addition to being affixed to envelopes to indicate that the sender has paid postage, stamps can also reflect the political, economic, and cultural development of various countries, possessing political significance and artistic value. Printing leaders' portraits on stamps allows the image of our great leader to circulate throughout the country and even the world along with the mail, which has a certain political significance. The stamps of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries also frequently feature portraits of revolutionary leaders and historical figures.

    Readers have suggested that postmarks should not be stamped on the heads of leaders' portraits on stamps, which is correct. The General Post Office has instructed local post offices to make efforts to avoid this situation.

    邮票上为什么要印领袖像
    有些读者来信询问，邮票上为什么要印领袖像。现简覆如下：
    邮票，除了贴在信封上表示寄信人已付邮资外，还可以反映出各个国家的政治、经济和文化的发展情况，有它的政治意义和艺术价值。在邮票上印领袖像，使我们伟大领袖的形象随着邮件在全国以至全世界流传，这就有它的一定的政治意义。苏联和各人民民主国家的邮票上，也经常印有革命领袖和历史人物的画像。
    读者建议不要把邮戳盖在邮票上领袖像的头部，这是正确的。邮政总局已指示各地邮局努力避免这种情况。
