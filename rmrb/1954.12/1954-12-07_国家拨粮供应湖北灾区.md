The state is transporting grain purchased in non-disaster areas of Hubei Province and Sichuan Province, and other places, to supply the people in the disaster areas of Hubei Province. Grain departments in non-disaster areas of Hubei Province are using manpower, animal power, rafts, and small boats to gather dispersed grain. Ships and tens of thousands of wooden boats, fully loaded with rice and paddy, are being transported to the disaster areas. In all disaster-stricken counties of the province, relevant departments are supplying grain to disaster victims using the simplest methods. Generally, each district has four grain supply points, and disaster areas have also organized hundreds of grain mobile supply teams composed of boats to deliver grain to disaster victims. Some grain supply points are finding ways to improve work efficiency and shorten the time spent by disaster victims purchasing grain; some disaster areas originally issued grain purchase certificates several times a month, but now issue them to each household once a month or once a quarter.

    国家拨粮供应湖北灾区
    国家在湖北省非灾区和四川省等地统购的粮食正源源运来供应湖北省灾区人民。湖北省非灾区的粮食部门正在利用人力、畜力、木筏和小船，把分散的粮食汇集起来。轮船和成万只木船满载着大米和稻谷，运往灾区。在全省各受灾县份，有关部门正用最简便的方法供应粮食给灾民。一般每区设有四个供粮点，灾区还组织了数百个由船只组成的粮食流动供应组，把粮食送给灾民。有些供粮点想办法提高工作效率，缩短了灾民购粮所花的时间；有的灾区原来每月发几次购粮证，现在改为按月或按季度一次发到各户。　（新华社）
