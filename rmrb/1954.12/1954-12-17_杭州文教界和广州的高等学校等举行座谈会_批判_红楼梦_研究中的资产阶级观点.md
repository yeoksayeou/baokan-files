The Education Department of Zhejiang Provincial People's Government and the Cultural and Educational Bureau of Hangzhou Municipal People's Government jointly held a symposium on December 10 to criticize bourgeois viewpoints in "Dream of the Red Chamber" research. Some Chinese language and history teachers from secondary schools in Hangzhou attended the symposium. Representatives from the Chinese Language and Literature Department of Zhejiang Normal College and the Hangzhou Branch of the China Democratic League also participated.

At the symposium, participants discussed the erroneous viewpoints reflected by Yu Pingbo in his "Dream of the Red Chamber" research, as well as the reflection of Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist erroneous viewpoints and methods in the teaching of Chinese language and history in secondary schools.

Many people pointed out in their speeches that China's classic literary masterpiece, "Dream of the Red Chamber," has a broad and profound impact on the general public. However, due to Hu Shi, Yu Pingbo, and others using bourgeois viewpoints and methods to distort and belittle the social value of "Dream of the Red Chamber," many people have also been influenced by their erroneous viewpoints. For example, some Chinese language teachers, although having read "Dream of the Red Chamber" many times, did not have a sufficient understanding of the rich ideological content of "Dream of the Red Chamber" in the past, and only regarded it as a good textbook for learning vernacular Chinese. Many teachers even viewed "Dream of the Red Chamber" from a perspective of amusement, only paying attention to the plot, and failing to see the true face and spiritual world of the entire feudal ruling class through the characters and events in "Dream of the Red Chamber." Everyone pointed out that Hu Shi's seemingly scientific bourgeois pragmatism has had a far-reaching impact in academic circles. Therefore, launching a criticism of the erroneous ideas in "Dream of the Red Chamber" research can not only enable everyone to correctly understand the social significance of classic literary works such as "Dream of the Red Chamber," but also serves as a wake-up call for the teaching of Chinese language and history in secondary schools.

The Zhongshan University Committee of the Chinese Education Trade Union held a symposium on "Dream of the Red Chamber" research for all teachers and staff on December 9. Xu Chongqing, President of the University, Vice Presidents Feng Naichao and Long Qian, Dean Wang Yue, Union Chairman Yang Keyi, and more than 500 teachers and staff attended the symposium. More than 20 teachers from South China Normal College and South China Institute of Technology also participated in the symposium.

The symposium was chaired by Wang Yue, Dean of the University. Wang Yue reported on the gains made by teachers in the liberal arts departments and the political theory teaching and research office of the university in the past four weeks of discussion on "Dream of the Red Chamber" research.

Feng Naichao, Vice President of the University, explained the purpose, requirements, and methods of launching this discussion on "Dream of the Red Chamber" research in his speech. Combining the specific situation of Zhongshan University, he explained the necessity of drawing a clear line between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in terms of academic ideology, and pointed out that: in learning and discussion, it is mainly necessary to clarify Yu Pingbo's errors in "Dream of the Red Chamber" research, so as to understand how the struggle between the two ideologies is manifested in specific issues. In this study, free discussion must be unfolded under the leadership of Marxism-Leninism. Only in this way can academic research work be improved a step further to meet the needs of socialist construction. He said: "Today's symposium is mainly about ideas, not about people. Therefore, don't be afraid of criticism, and don't be afraid to raise opinions, but have the determination to fight for the truth." Finally, he said: "We must pay attention to the cultivation of new forces; but this does not mean that we only want young people and not old people. All forces that use Marxist-Leninist viewpoints to engage in academic research are new forces, and we must pay attention to cultivating them."

Wang Qi, Director of the Chinese Language and Literature Department of the University, explained the fundamental difference between the two different literary and artistic theories of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in dealing with the great work "Dream of the Red Chamber." In addition, Lou Qi, Deputy Director of the Chinese Language and Literature Department, Professor Shang Chengzuo, Lecturer Chen Zeguang, Dai Liuling, Director of the Western Language and Literature Department, and Zhong Yijun, Associate Professor of the History Department, also spoke at the symposium.

The criticism of bourgeois idealist viewpoints in "Dream of the Red Chamber" research has attracted the attention of literary and art circles and educational circles in Inner Mongolia.

The Inner Mongolia Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a symposium on criticizing bourgeois viewpoints in "Dream of the Red Chamber" research on the afternoon of December 6. Literary and art workers from the Literature and Art Department of the Inner Mongolia Branch of the CPC Central Committee, the Literature and Art Department of the Inner Mongolia Cultural Bureau, and the Inner Mongolia Song and Dance Troupe, as well as teachers from Inner Mongolia Normal College, Hohhot No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Middle Schools, and Hohhot Normal School, totaling more than 40 people, participated in the symposium.

The meeting was presided over by Yin Shoushi, Deputy Director of the Inner Mongolia Federation of Literary and Art Circles. After he explained the important significance of the meeting, the participants actively spoke in the discussion.

In their speeches, everyone unanimously pointed out that Yu Pingbo's research on "Dream of the Red Chamber" completely followed Hu Shi's path. In his "Dream of the Red Chamber" research, he did not use textual research as a means of research work to explore the realistic significance and ideological content of the era reflected in "Dream of the Red Chamber," but proceeded from amusement and was obsessed with individual irrelevant details. Therefore, Yu Pingbo extracted the social background of the era reflected in "Dream of the Red Chamber," conducted textual research in isolation, and interpreted a great classic literary work into a naturalistic, vulgar work of "lust" and "emptiness," thus negating its anti-feudal tendency.

The participants also cited examples in their speeches to illustrate the harm of this bourgeois idealist viewpoint to academic research and to young people. Everyone believed that the symposium held by the Inner Mongolia Federation of Literary and Art Circles was timely and necessary because Hu Shi's and Yu Pingbo's bourgeois idealist viewpoints also had an impact in our Inner Mongolia cultural and educational circles. Some teachers explained this fact by connecting the erroneous ideas existing in their teaching in their speeches.

In their speeches, everyone also criticized the reactionary "pragmatism" ideological essence of the Hu Shi faction and the far-fetched so-called "traditionality" explained by Yu Pingbo in his "Dream of the Red Chamber" research, and explained that the real traditionality in our classic literary works is the inheritance of realistic creative methods, the inheritance and development of the people's character in the works, and the innovation and creation of national style.

Everyone also believed that through this criticism of bourgeois viewpoints in "Dream of the Red Chamber" research, we will be able to improve a step further and find a correct direction for future academic research work, that is, we must use the viewpoints, positions, and methods of Marxism-Leninism to treat academic research work.

### 杭州文教界和广州的高等学校等举行座谈会  批判“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级观点

    杭州文教界和广州的高等学校等举行座谈会
    批判“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级观点
    浙江省人民政府教育厅和杭州市人民政府文教局于十二月十日联合举行批判“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级观点的座谈会。出席座谈会的有杭州市各中等学校的部分语文、历史科教师。浙江师范学院中国语言文学系、中国民主同盟杭州市分部均派代表参加了座谈会。
    在座谈会上，大家就俞平伯在“红楼梦”研究中所反映的错误观点，以及胡适派资产阶级唯心论的错误观点和方法在中等学校文史科教学中的反映，进行了讨论。
    不少人在发言中指出，我国古典文学名著“红楼梦”在广大群众中有着广泛、深刻的影响，但是，由于胡适、俞平伯等人运用资产阶级的观点、方法去歪曲、贬低“红楼梦”的社会价值，因而使不少人也受了他们错误观点的影响。如有的中国语文教师虽然多次阅读“红楼梦”，但过去对“红楼梦”的丰富的思想内容却认识不足，只不过把它当做学习白话文的好教本而已；不少教师更是从趣味观点出发去看“红楼梦”，只注意其中的情节，而不能透过“红楼梦”中的人物和事件看出整个封建统治阶级的真实面貌和精神世界。大家指出了胡适派的貌似科学的资产阶级实验主义，在学术界有着深远的影响。因而，展开对“红楼梦”研究中的错误思想的批判，不仅能使大家正确认识“红楼梦”这一类古典文学作品的社会意义，更为中等学校的语文、历史科教学敲起了警钟。（浙）
    中国教育工会中山大学委员会于十二月九日举行了全校教师、职员关于“红楼梦”研究座谈会。出席这次座谈会的有该校校长许崇清，副校长冯乃超、龙潜，教务长王越，工会主席杨克毅等及全体教师、职员五百余人。华南师范学院和华南工学院的教师二十余人也参加了座谈会。
    座谈会由该校教务长王越主持。王越报告了该校文科各系和政治理论课教研室的教师们四周来关于“红楼梦”研究讨论的收获。
    该校副校长冯乃超在座谈中对这次开展关于“红楼梦”研究讨论的目的、要求和做法作了说明。他结合中山大学的具体情况说明了从学术思想上划清无产阶级和资产阶级的界限的必要性，并指出：在学习和讨论中，主要要弄清楚俞平伯在“红楼梦”研究中的错误，从而领会两种思想斗争如何在具体问题上表现出来。在这次学习中，必须在马克思列宁主义的领导下，展开自由讨论。只有这样，才能把学术研究工作提高一步，以配合社会主义建设的需要。他说：“今天的座谈，主要是对思想，而不是对人。因此，不要怕批评，也不要不敢提意见，而要有为真理而奋斗的决心。”最后，他说：“我们必须注意新生力量的培养；但这并不是说，只要年青人而不要老年人，凡是运用马克思列宁主义的观点来从事学术研究的力量，都是新生的力量，都要注意培植。”
    该校中国语言文学系主任王起就无产阶级和资产阶级两种不同的文艺理论在处理“红楼梦”这部伟大作品的根本区别上作了说明。此外，中国语言文学系副主任楼栖、教授商承祚、讲师陈则光、西方语言文学系主任戴镏龄、历史系副教授锺一均都在座谈会上作了发言。（南）
    对“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级唯心论观点的批判，已引起内蒙古文艺界、教育界的重视。
    内蒙古文学艺术工作者联合会在十二月六日下午举行了关于批判“红楼梦”研究中资产阶级观点的座谈会。参加座谈会的有中共中央内蒙古分局文艺处、内蒙古文化局文艺处、内蒙古歌舞剧团的文艺工作者，以及内蒙古师范学院、呼和浩特第一、二、三中学、呼和浩特师范学校教员等共四十余人。
    会议由内蒙古文联副主任尹瘦石主持。他讲述了这次会议的重要意义以后，在讨论中，到会的人踊跃发言。
    大家在发言中一致指出：俞平伯研究“红楼梦”完全走了胡适的道路。他在“红楼梦”研究中，不是把考证做为研究工作的一种手段，以探求“红楼梦”所反映的时代的现实意义、思想内容，而是从趣味出发，醉心于个别无关重要的细节。因此，俞平伯抽去了“红楼梦”所反映的时代的社会背景，孤立地进行考证，把一部伟大的古典文学作品解释成为自然主义的，“色”“空”的庸俗作品，而否定了它的反封建的倾向性。
    到会者在发言中也举例说明了这种资产阶级唯心论观点，对学术研究工作及对青年的毒害。大家认为：内蒙古文联召开的座谈会是适时的，必要的。因为胡适、俞平伯的资产阶级唯心论观点，在我们内蒙古文化教育界也是有影响的。有些教师在发言时联系自己在教学中存在的错误思想说明了这个事实。
    大家在发言中对胡适派的反动的“实验主义”的思想实质和俞平伯在“红楼梦”研究中所解释的牵强附会的所谓“传统性”也进行了批判，并说明，在我们古典文学作品中真正的传统性，是现实主义创作方法的继承，作品中人民性的继承与发挥和民族风格的革新与创造。
    大家并认为：通过这次对“红楼梦”研究中资产阶级观点的批判，会使我们提高一步，并为今后的学术研究工作找到一个正确的方向，那就是一定要用马克思列宁主义的观点、立场和方法来对待学术研究工作。（艺）
