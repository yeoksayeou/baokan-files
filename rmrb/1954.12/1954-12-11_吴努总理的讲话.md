Premier U Nu's Speech

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Geographically, China and Burma are neighbors, but for various reasons, we have not been as close as we should have been in the past. However, from the day we issued the joint statement on the Five Principles, the path for closer relations between our two countries has been laid.

My colleagues and I firmly believe that our visit to this great country at your kind invitation will have the effect of solidly paving this road.

My colleagues and I have stayed in China for eleven days. During this period, we visited several cities, toured various factories in those cities, and took the opportunity to talk with people from all walks of life, including senior leaders, political figures, workers, farmers, and students.

Wherever we went, we were warmly welcomed by leaders, political figures, administrators, enterprise workers, farmers, and students, not as guests on a routine official trip to this country, but as relatives who had been separated for many years returning from overseas. This hospitality is truly profound.

There is a saying, "Love begets love." When our Chinese friends expressed their deepest affection to us, we reciprocated with the same feelings without hesitation. Our hearts are filled with gratitude for this pleasant experience.

When we first embarked on the road of Sino-Burmese friendship, we had some trepidation about the mountains, rivers, and forests along the way. But after walking on this road of friendship for eleven days, our trepidation has disappeared, and I can now say with certainty that the goal of Sino-Burmese friendship is within reach.

Ladies and gentlemen, you may recall that when I arrived at the Beijing airport, I made a brief speech in which I cited three main reasons for my visit to China, one of which was to lay the foundation for Sino-Burmese friendship. I would like to take this opportunity to announce that today, a very solid foundation has been well and truly laid.

Ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues and I will be leaving Beijing the day after tomorrow. Before I leave, I would like to make an important statement.

Since our first meeting in Rangoon, and in subsequent meetings, I have mentioned to Premier Zhou that we once had serious concerns that the People's Republic of China might interfere in our internal affairs. I think you will remember that I mentioned this.

To be honest, if we stop here, we would be unfair. I don't like unfair or asymmetrical things. Therefore, I imagined myself in your position and asked myself this question:

"My dear U Nu, I have heard your concerns. Shouldn't we also be concerned about the possibility of you interfering in our internal affairs?"

Let me answer my own question. Our small country has no ability on its own to interfere in your internal affairs. Even if such a thing were to happen, it could be compared to a lamb wandering aimlessly in a herd of elephants. If the elephants are happy, even a tap with their tail could kill the lamb. However, although Burma may not have the ability on its own to interfere in China's internal affairs, if it allows itself to be used as a pawn by China's enemies, it may be able to create some trouble in China. If we were willing to act as such a pawn, then we have some key locations that could be provided as strategic naval and air force bases for possible attacks on the People's Republic of China. We could also facilitate espionage and sabotage activities within China by China's enemies.

In this regard, I would like to make an unequivocal assurance to my good friend Premier Zhou Enlai on behalf of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League government:

1.  Our Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League leaders are young patriots whose hearts are burning with our own national pride. We are very proud and will never become anyone's pawn. Such a pawn is a beast in human form who has no independent thought. They only repeat their masters' words, and their actions are dictated solely by their masters' orders. Certainly, these people are the opposite of the self-respecting people in our hearts. We speak for ourselves, and we can only be friends, never pawns. I want to assure my respected friend Premier Zhou Enlai that under no circumstances will we become a pawn of any country.

2.  Most importantly, our Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League leaders will never allow themselves to be seen as treacherous people in history. We have publicly laid the foundation for lasting friendship between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma. We will never betray our promise. If we do, then there will be no one more hateful in the world than us. If we betray our promise, then not only ourselves, but the entire country we represent will be condemned forever. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to assure my respected friend Premier Zhou Enlai that we will never be treacherous, because such behavior will bring worldwide condemnation not only to ourselves but to our entire country.

3.  We desire peace more than anything else. The Burmese people were under British rule for nearly a hundred years, and we only regained our freedom seven years ago. With independence, we have the task of improving our backward masses so that they can live fulfilling lives. We must strive in terms of physical strength, intellectual ability, economy, society, and morality. Even if we could obtain the necessary manpower, financial resources, materials, and carefully formulated plans, it might take about forty years to complete our planned activities satisfactorily. But now, because we do not fully possess these necessary conditions, it may take us fifty to sixty years to realize our various plans. We will have to devote all possible strength to this goal. While we are going to be busy with our own construction work, we will have no time to engage in war, whether as pawns or as major participants. A rebellion and a full-scale war are, of course, vastly different, but even a single rebellion has caused us unspeakable suffering. In the event of war, it is certain that we will not only be unable to complete our plans, but even the little achievements we have made will be reduced to ashes. Therefore, I wish to assure my respected friend Premier Zhou Enlai that we are determined to do our utmost to maintain peace, and we will do nothing that would undermine peace.

When talking about peace, I cannot help but think of world peace. From world peace, I think of East Asian peace. Honestly, we are terrified every day by the specter of war in this part of the world—a war that could escalate into a world war. In the face of this fear, we often wonder what is the best way to avoid such a war.

Please forgive me if my views are incorrect. If I am to speak my mind, I believe that if the People's Republic of China and the United States of America could reach an understanding, much of the tension in East Asia would be eased. I also believe that reaching such an understanding is not as difficult as most people think. I believe that as long as someone bravely and sincerely tries to eliminate the differences between these two countries, instead of pitting them against each other, much of the tension between them will be greatly eased, if not completely eliminated as people hope.

Neither of these two countries can be said to be bad. Let them each follow their own political system. Any political system that is accepted by the majority of the people of a country must be considered the best system for that country.

As a people, the Americans are very generous and very brave. In terms of scientific knowledge, the Americans have developed to the point where they can make this world a place where people can live happy and prosperous lives.

The Chinese people are also very generous and very brave. When the people of other countries in the world were still barbarians, they already enjoyed a very high degree of civilization. Therefore, we have great affection for the people of both countries. Because the Chinese and Burmese people are close neighbors and have had similar experiences in history, our affection for the Chinese people may be even deeper.

The distinguished guests present tonight can judge from my following statement whether what I have said about these two countries is merely flattery or from the bottom of my heart.

The government I have the honor to lead will not only never accept unilateral aid that might make either of these two countries suspicious, but will never even entertain the idea of accepting such aid. Nor will we take a course of action under the direction of one country that would cause concern to the other. I hope I have convinced you that our feelings for these two great countries are very sincere.

We do not want these two respectable countries to harbor hatred and hostility towards each other. As a friend of both countries, I hope that these two countries can get along very amicably. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to assure my respected friend Premier Zhou Enlai that I will do my utmost to facilitate an understanding between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America.

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the great Chinese leaders Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, members of the government, civil servants, people's organizations, workers, and farmers for the warm welcome they have extended to me and my colleagues upon our arrival in this great country.

Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the students everywhere who have treated me as a brother with deep affection.

I now propose a toast to the health of the great national leader Chairman Mao Zedong.

### 吴努总理的讲话

1954-12-11
第1版()
专栏：

    吴努总理的讲话各位女士和先生，
    从地理上说来，中国和缅甸是邻邦，但是由于各种原因，我们在过去一直没有像我们应当做到的那样亲近。然而，从我们发表了五项原则的联合声明的那一日起，我们两国发生更密切关系的道路已经奠定了。
    我和我的同事们都坚定地相信，我们应你们的盛情邀请来到这个伟大国家进行的访问，是具有结实地铺平这条道路的效果。
    我和我的同事们已在中国逗留了十一天，在这个期间我们访问了好几个城市，参观了那些城市的各种工厂，并且利用了这种机会同各界人士，包括高级领导人员、政界人物、工人、农民和学生，进行了谈话。
    不论我们到什么地方，我们都受到领导人员、政界人物、行政人员、企业工人、农民和学生们的热烈欢迎，不是作为在这个国家作例行的官方旅行的客人，而是作为分别多年的从海外归来的亲戚。这种盛情实在是无比深厚的。
    有一句俗语说，“爱产生爱”。当我们的中国朋友向我们表示最最热爱的感情时，我们毫不迟缓地报以同样的感情。我们的心中对这种愉快的经历充满了感谢的情绪。
    当我们刚刚踏上中缅友谊的道路时，我们想到一路上的山脉、河流和森林，曾有某种疑惧。但是在这条友谊的道路上走了十一天之后，我们的疑惧消失了，我现在可以肯定地说：我们中缅友谊的目标是伸手可及的。
    诸位，你们也许还记得，在我到达北京机场时，我发表了简短的谈话，其中我举出了我来访问中国的三点主要理由，其中之一便是为中缅友谊奠定基础。我要借这个机会宣布，今天，非常坚实的基础已经很好地和真正地奠定了。
    诸位，我和我的同事们在后天就要离开北京了。在我离开之前，我要作一个重要的声明。
    自从我们在仰光首次会见，以及后来历次会见的过程中，我曾经向周总理提到过，我们一度对中华人民共和国干涉我国内政的可能性，怀有严重的疑惧。我想您是会记得我提到过这一点的。
    说老实话，如果我们想到这里为止，我们就不公平了。我不喜欢不公平或不对称的事。因此，我设想处在您的地位，向我自己提出这样一个问题：
  “我亲爱的吴努，我已经听到了您的疑惧。我们不也应当对你们干涉我国内政的可能性怀有疑惧吗？”
    让我来回答我自己的问题。我们小小的国家要靠自己决没有能力来干涉你们的内政。即使竟然发生这样的事情，也很可以把它比喻作为一只羔羊漫无目的地在大象群里徘徊。如果大象高兴，那怕是用尾巴打它一下，这只羔羊就要丧命了。但是，虽然缅甸靠它自己可能没有能力干涉中国的内政，但如果它容许自己被中国的敌人利用作走卒的话，它可能有能力在中国制造一些麻烦。如果我们竟然愿意充当这样一种走卒的话，那么，我们有一些要害地点可以提供出来，用作对中华人民共和国可能进行攻击的海空军战略基地。我们还能为中国的敌人在中国内部进行间谍和破坏活动提供便利。
    在这方面，我要代表反法西斯人民自由同盟政府向我的好朋友周恩来总理提出毫不含糊的保证：
  一、我们的反法西斯人民自由同盟领导人员是内心燃烧着我们自己的民族自豪感的年青爱国者。我们非常自豪，决不会成为任何人的走卒。这样一种走卒是一个人面兽心的动物，他没有独立的思想。他们只是重复他们的主子的话，他们的行动是唯他们的主子之命是听的。十分肯定，这些人同我们心目中的有自尊心的人是相反的。我们代表自己说话，我们只能是朋友而决不能是走卒。我要向我的尊敬的朋友周恩来总理提出保证：在任何情况下，我们决不成为任何国家的走卒。
  二、比一切都重要的是，我们的反法西斯人民自由同盟领导人员决不让自己在历史上成为背信弃义的人。我们已经公开地奠定了中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦之间持久友谊的基础。我们决不背弃我们的保证。如果我们这样做，那么世界上再也没有比我们更可讨厌的人了。如果我们背弃我们的保证，那么不但我们自己，而且我们代表的整个国家都将永远受到谴责。因此，我要利用这个机会向我的尊敬的朋友周恩来总理保证：我们决不背信弃义，因为，这种行为不但将给我们自己、而且将给我们整个国家带来全世界的谴责。
  三、我们希望和平甚于希望任何其他东西。缅甸人民过去受英国统治近一百年之久，我们只是在七年前才重新取得了我们的自由。随着独立，我们就有了提高我们的落后群众使他们能够过美满生活的任务。我们必须在体力、智力、经济、社会和道德方面进行努力。即令我们能够获得必要的人力、财力、物力和周密制订的计划，或许也需要四十年左右的时间才能圆满地完成我们所计划的活动。但是，现在，由于我们并不完全具备这些必要条件，我们或许需要五十年到六十年的时间才能实现我们的各种计划。我们将必须把一切可能的力量用在这个目标上。在我们将要忙于我们自己的建设工作的情况下，我们将没有时间从事战争，不论是以走卒的身份，或是以主要参加者的身份。一次叛乱和一次全面的战争比起来，自然是小巫见大巫，但是，那怕单单是这样一次叛乱都使我们遭受了无以言状的苦难。在遇到战争时，可以肯定，我们不但不能完成我们的计划，就连我们所取得的一点成就都会化为灰烬的。因此，我愿向我的尊敬的朋友周恩来总理保证，我们决心尽最大力量来维护和平，我们决不做任何足以破坏和平的事情。
    在谈论和平的时候，我不禁想到世界和平。从世界和平我又想到东亚和平。老实说，我们天天对世界上这一部分地区的战争魔影感到恐惧——这种战争将会扩大成为世界大战。在抱有这种恐惧的情况下，我们经常在想什么才是避免这样的战争的最好的办法。
    如果我的看法不对的话，请原谅。如果我要说出我内心的想法的话，我认为如果中华人民共和国和美利坚合众国能够达成谅解，东亚的大部分紧张局势将会得到缓和。我还认为达成这种谅解并不像一般人所想的那样困难。我相信，只要有人勇敢而真诚地设法消除这两个国家之间的分歧，而不是使它们互相对立，那么它们之间的大部分紧张局势将会大大缓和，如果不是像人们所希望的那样完全消除的话。
    这两个国家中哪一个也不能说是不好的。让它们各自遵行自己的政治制度好了。任何为一个国家的多数人民所接受的政治制度都必须被看做是这国家的最好的制度。
    作为一国的人民来说，美国人是十分慷慨，十分勇敢的。在科学知识方面，美国人已发展到这样地步：他们能够使这个世界成为一个可以过幸福和繁荣的生活的地方。
    中国人民也是十分慷慨，十分勇敢的。在世界其他各国人民还是野蛮人的时候，他们便已享有极高度的文明。因此，我们对这两国人民都是十分敬爱的。由于中国人民和缅甸人民是近邻，在历史上有过同样的遭遇，我们对中国人民的敬爱也许更深厚些。
    今晚在座的贵宾很可以从我下面的声明中判断我所说的关于这两个国家的话只是口头奉承还是出于肺腑的话。
    我有此荣幸来领导的政府不仅决不接受可能使这两国中任何一国感到疑惧的单方面的援助，甚至连接受这种援助的想法也决不抱有。我们也不会在
  一国指使下采取会引起另一国忧虑的行动方针。我希望我已经使大家相信：我们对这两个伟大的国家的感情是非常真诚的。
    我们不希望这两个可尊敬的国家互相怀恨和敌视。作为这两国的一个朋友，我希望这两国能够极其友好地相处。因此，我希望借这个机会向我的尊敬的朋友周恩来总理保证：我将尽我最大的力量来促成中华人民共和国和美利坚合众国之间的谅解。
    我希望对伟大的中国领袖毛泽东主席、朱德副主席、常务委员会刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理、政府组成人员、公务人员、人民团体、工人们和农民们在我和我的同事们到达这个伟大的国家后对我们表示的热情致以衷心的感谢。
    最后我愿对抱着深厚的感情把我当做兄长看待的各地的学生们致以衷心的感谢。
    我现在提议为伟大的民族领袖毛泽东主席的健康干杯。
