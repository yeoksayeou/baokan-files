    The New Year is approaching. The Beijing Food Company and other units have already begun preparing for the supply of non-staple foods for the New Year. As early as November, large numbers of purchasing agents from various units went to Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Sichuan and other places to purchase oranges and tangerines, to Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and other places to transfer edible cattle and sheep, and to various places in southern China to purchase large quantities of Yangtze River carp and bighead carp. Various New Year foods have been shipped from all production areas across the country. This year, the quantity of various major non-staple foods supplied to residents of the capital will increase again compared to last year, with pork increasing by 18.3 percent, apples increasing by 133 percent, bananas increasing by 112 percent, oranges and tangerines reaching 1 million jin in just three days of wholesale by the Food Company and cooperatives, fresh aquatic products increasing by 115 percent, and dried vegetables also increasing.

    首都新年将增加副食品供应
    新年就要到了。北京市食品公司等单位早已开始准备新年副食品的供应工作。各单位的大批采购员在十一月就分头到广东、江西、浙江、四川等地购买桔柑，到内蒙古、山西等地调运食用牛羊，到江南各地采购大量的长江鲤鱼和胖头鱼。各种新年食品已陆续由全国各产地启运。今年供应首都居民的各种主要副食品数量比去年又有增加，其中猪肉增加百分之十八点三，苹果增加百分之一百三十三，香蕉增加百分之一百十二，桔柑仅食品公司和合作社三天的批发量即达一百万斤，鲜水产增加百分之一百十五，干菜也都有增加。　（唐兴赓）
