    Save the Draught Cattle in Disaster Areas
    National People's Congress Representative Chen Yike
    Recently, the weather has suddenly turned cold, and some draught cattle in flood-stricken areas are facing a serious threat of starvation and freezing to death due to lack of fodder and cattle pens. Our cooperative originally had 115 head of draught cattle, and recently, with the arrival of the cold wave, 15 head died suddenly, and another six are sick. This phenomenon is very serious in our area (Yongxiu County, Jiangxi Province). On December 8th, I went to Wangjia Village in Chunhu Township and saw three dead cattle lying in front of the village with my own eyes. On December 10th, I went to the county and passed by the entrance of the supply and marketing cooperative's county association, and saw more than 40 farmers lining up to sell cowhides. It is evident how serious the death of draught cattle is in the disaster areas currently.
    Why is the death of draught cattle occurring? Taking our agricultural production cooperative as an example, on June 17th, the embankment broke, and the village was flooded with water more than half a person deep. The draught cattle could not be moved out immediately and were soaked in the water for six or seven days. When they were moved to the mountains, the sheds built were only enough for people to live in. For a full three months, the draught cattle had to endure the sun and dew outside. After the water receded back to the village, the cooperative was busy with the rush of winter plowing and planting, repairing embankments, and did not take good care of the draught cattle. This has resulted in widespread emaciation and death of draught cattle. In response to this serious situation, our cooperative has specifically established a draught cattle management committee, with division of responsibilities, regular inspections, ensuring that the draught cattle are fed and the pens are dry, and has now basically stopped the serious phenomenon of starvation and freezing to death of draught cattle. Here, we should thank the People's Government and the people of non-disaster areas for their concern. The People's Government promptly provided our disaster-stricken people here with loans of 80 million yuan, and our agricultural cooperative received 2.5 million yuan in loans. The people of non-disaster areas have also provided us with a lot of cattle fodder. Without the support of the government and the people of non-disaster areas, we don't know how many more of our draught cattle would have died.
    However, at present, some farmers in the disaster areas do not pay attention to protecting the safety of draught cattle during the winter. For example, in Jiuhe Embankment in our area, many farmers have not built cattle pens and casually leave the cattle on the sandbanks, exposed to wind and rain. Although the farmers in Wangjia Village in Chunhu Township have built cattle pens, they generally leak and are drafty. Some farmers even don't take the freezing to death of draught cattle seriously, saying that it doesn't matter if they die, the government will find a way for us next year. These practices and ideas are wrong and are not beneficial to the country or the farmers. We must understand that draught cattle are the lifeline of our farmers' production development, and we should earnestly cherish them and protect them to safely survive the winter.
    In order to reduce the death of draught cattle in disaster areas, I have four suggestions.
    1. Farmers in disaster areas who are unable to feed their draught cattle should actively find ways to send the cattle to non-disaster areas for the winter through relatives, friends, agricultural cooperatives, and mutual aid groups. Farmers in non-disaster areas should continue to promote the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity to help farmers in disaster areas solve this difficulty.
    2. It is suggested that the government try its best to help farmers in disaster areas avoid and reduce the loss of dead draught cattle. Old cattle that are truly useless should be actively purchased. Our agricultural production cooperative has four old cattle that should have been sold earlier, but the food company refused to buy them, and as a result, they died. No one wanted them, and the members divided the meat and ate it, resulting in a great loss.
    3. For farmers in disaster areas who cannot afford to build cattle pens, the government should provide appropriate loans to help after certain proof. Farmers in disaster areas should truly use these loans to build cattle pens and purchase fodder to ensure that the draught cattle do not continue to die.
    4. Local draught cattle conservation stations should earnestly take responsibility for conserving draught cattle and regularly send people to disaster areas to inspect the draught cattle. If any are found to be sick, help should be provided to treat them in time, which will reduce the loss of many draught cattle deaths. Five cattle in our cooperative began to get sick, and we found a veterinarian in time, who cured them. This shows that timely treatment of cattle diseases is an important task in reducing the death of draught cattle.

    救救灾区的耕牛
    全国人民代表大会代表　陈翊科
    最近天气突然转寒，有些水灾区的耕牛，因缺乏草料，缺乏牛栏，正面临着饿死冻死的严重威胁。我们社原有耕牛一百一十五头，最近寒潮一来，一下就死了十五头，正在病的还有六头。这种现象在我们这里（江西省永修县）十分严重。十二月八日我到淳湖乡王家村，亲眼看到村前躺着三头死牛。十二月十日我到县里，经过供销社县联社门口，看到光排队出卖牛皮的农民就有四十多人。可见目前在灾区耕牛死亡的严重了。
    为什么会造成耕牛死亡呢？就拿我们农业生产合作社来说吧，六月十七日破圩，村里淹了半人多深的水，耕牛一下转移不出去，在水里泡了六、七天。等转移到了山区，搭盖的棚子只够人住，整整三个月的时间，耕牛都只得在外面日晒夜露。水退回村后，社里又忙着突击冬耕冬种，修堤复堤，对耕牛没有很好照顾。这样就造成了耕牛普遍消瘦和死亡。针对这个严重情况，我们社专门成立了耕牛保管委员会，分工负责，经常检查，保证了耕牛食饱栏干，随时有病随时医治，现在已基本上停止了饿死、冻死耕牛的严重现象。这里应该感谢人民政府和非灾区人民对我们的关怀。人民政府及时给我们这里的灾区人民贷款八千万元，我们农业社就贷到了二百五十万元，非灾区人民也给我们支援了很多牛草。没有政府和非灾区人民的支援，我们的耕牛不知还要死亡多少。
    但是，目前灾区还有一部分农民不注意保护耕牛安全过冬。例如我区九合圩不少农民的牛栏都未搭好，随便把牛放在洲滩上，风吹雨淋。淳湖乡王家村的农民虽然搭盖了牛栏，但普遍漏雨透风。甚至有些农民对耕牛冻死不当一回事，说死了不要紧，明年政府会给我们想办法。这些作法和想法是不对的，对国家，对农民都是没有好处的。要了解耕牛是我们农民发展生产的命根子，我们应认真的爱护它，保护它安全过冬。
    为了减少灾区耕牛的死亡，我有四点建议。
    一、无法喂养耕牛的灾区农民应主动的想办法，通过亲戚朋友、农业合作社、互助组的关系，把牛送往非灾区过冬。非灾区的农民应继续发挥互助友爱精神，帮助灾区农民解决这个困难。
    二、建议政府尽量设法帮助灾区农民避免和减少死亡耕牛的损失。对真正没用的老牛应主动收购。我们农业生产合作社有四头老牛，本应该早卖，但食品公司硬不收购，结果死了，谁也不要，社员们把肉分吃了，损失很大。
    三、对灾区农民搭盖不起牛栏的，经过一定证明，政府应适当贷款帮助。灾区农民应把这种贷款真正用在搭盖牛栏，购买草料，保证做到不使耕牛继续死亡。
    四、各地耕牛保育站，要切实负起保育耕牛的责任，并经常派人到灾区检查耕牛，发现有病，及时帮助医治，这样就会减少许多耕牛死亡的损失。我们社开始有五头牛生病，及时找到了牛医，就治好了。这说明及时医治牛病是减少耕牛死亡的一项重要工作。
