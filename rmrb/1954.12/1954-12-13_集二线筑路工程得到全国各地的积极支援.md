Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 10th: The construction of the Jining to Erlian section of the Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway has received active support from people all over the country. Since construction began last year, more than 10,000 cadres and skilled workers have been transferred to the Jining-Erlian section from the Northwest, Shanghai, Wuhan and other places. Thousands of types of construction materials have also been transported from various places, including more than 1,400 tons of steel bars and more than 600,000 specially made sleepers.

During construction, the Jining-Erlian section received strong assistance in terms of manpower, materials and other aspects. In the Pingdiquan Administrative Region of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region alone, more than 30,000 migrant workers participated in the road construction, and dozens of trucks and more than 1,000 bullock carts and horse-drawn carts were dispatched. After the project entered winter construction, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has supplied workers with more than one million jin of fresh meat, vegetables and fruits.

In order to supply workers with drinking water and project water, many Mongolian people told the workers about water sources. In the twelfth work zone under construction in the desert area, because of the difficulty in transporting water, the members of the Burenlai mutual aid group of Mongolian nationality personally sent eight Bactrian camels to carry water to the construction site. Many people along the route gave their yurts and houses to the workers as temporary offices and dormitories.

    集二线筑路工程得到全国各地的积极支援
    【新华社呼和浩特十日电】集宁—乌兰巴托铁路的集宁到二连段工程，得到全国各地人民的积极支援。自去年开始修建以来，从西北、上海、武汉等地陆续调来集二段的干部和技术工人已有一万多名，从各地运来的建筑器材也上千种，其中如钢筋就有一千四百多吨，特制枕木有六十多万根。
    在修筑中，集二段从人力、物力等各方面都得到有力的援助。仅内蒙古自治区平地泉行政区一地参加筑路的民工有三万人以上，还出动了几十辆汽车和一千多辆牛车、马车。在工程进入冬季施工后，内蒙古自治区已经供应职工一百万斤以上的新鲜肉类、菜蔬和水果。
    为了供给工人饮水和工程用水，许多蒙族人民都把水源地告诉工人。在沙漠地区施工的十二工区，因为运水困难，蒙民柏仁莱互助组的组员亲自送去八峰骆驼，给工地驮水。沿线很多人把自己居住的蒙古包和房屋，让给工人们作临时办公室和宿舍。
