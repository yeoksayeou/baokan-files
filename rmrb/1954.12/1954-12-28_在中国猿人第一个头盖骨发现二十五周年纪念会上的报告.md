    Report at the Commemorative Meeting for the 25th Anniversary of the Discovery of the First Peking Man Skull
    Guo Moruo
    The Sinanthropus Pekinensis, or "Peking Man," had his first skull discovered on December 2, 1929. This year marks the 25th anniversary.
    The discovery of fossil humans from 500,000 years ago is naturally a significant event in scientific research. As everyone knows, the Zhoukoudian excavation work before liberation was conducted with the participation of imperialist forces, while today it has become a completely people's scientific endeavor, which is the first thing worth celebrating.
    We must not forget that the initial discovery of the Sinanthropus Pekinensis fossil site should be credited to the local people. Before the first skull was discovered, some teeth and skull fragments had been found. In 1927, a molar was discovered, which was identified and named "Sinanthropus Pekinensis." However, it was not until December 2, 1929, when Comrade Pei Wenzhong discovered the very complete first skull, that the solid scientific foundation of Sinanthropus Pekinensis was laid.
    The initial excavation of Zhoukoudian, from 1927 until the Japanese imperialists launched their war of aggression against China in 1937, was never interrupted.
    According to incomplete statistics, the Sinanthropus Pekinensis site was excavated for a total of 1,873 days, totaling 178,965 workdays, not including the personnel engaged in research and repair work in Beijing City. At the Sinanthropus Pekinensis site, approximately 20,000 cubic meters of rock and sand were excavated. At other sites, 4,200 cubic meters were excavated. Such a large-scale excavation was, in fact, unprecedented in the world.
    As a result of such a large-scale excavation, a total of 1,221 boxes—approximately 375 cubic meters—of specimens awaiting repair were collected. At the first site where Sinanthropus Pekinensis was discovered alone, a large number of finds were made successively after the discovery of the first skull. Including the results of the later excavations since liberation, there are already about forty individuals of Sinanthropus Pekinensis fossils, including five relatively complete skulls, seven skull fragments, two maxillae, fourteen mandibles, and one hundred and fifty-two teeth. There are also some broken limb bones, a clavicle, three humeri, a lunate bone, seven femurs, and a tibia. Cultural relics unearthed at the same time include Old Stone Age tools and artificially struck stone flakes and blocks, totaling more than 100,000 pieces, as well as evidence of fire use. There are also two types of plant fossils and one hundred and eighteen types of animal fossils—including ninety-four types of mammals, of which thirty types are extinct. The abundance of animal fossils is astonishing in some cases. For example, there are more than two thousand individuals each of Sinomegaceros pachyosteus and hyena.
    Regarding human fossils, the materials known today are the Java Man in Southeast Asia and our "Peking Man," which are the oldest. The ages of the two are not far apart, and it is generally believed that Java Man is earlier. However, the first discoveries of Java Man were only three teeth, an incomplete skull, and a femur, and it is not certain whether they belong to the same individual. Although there are a few stone tools, no evidence of fire use has been found. Later, stimulated by the Zhoukoudian excavation, excavations continued after 1929, resulting in four skulls and new hominin fossils, but compared to the richness of the Zhoukoudian remains, they are still greatly inferior.
    In the past twenty years, the data excavated from Zhoukoudian have been studied separately by researchers, and 72 special volumes of single-article papers have been published, totaling 4,310 printed pages. General articles and popular texts are not included. Although these research results are mixed with the work of scholars from many capitalist countries and inevitably contain a large number of idealist statements, the abundance of materials has confirmed that China is the region with the most abundant human fossils in the world. All relevant materials have laid a certain foundation for further understanding the history of human development, the evolutionary process of vertebrates, and the geology of the Quaternary period.
    In terms of human development, Sinanthropus Pekinensis is an intermediate type from ape to human. The large number of Old Stone Age tools, artificially struck stone flakes and blocks, and evidence of fire use that were discovered at the same time, these cultural relics can fully reflect the living conditions of Sinanthropus Pekinensis. Furthermore, by examining the many coexisting animal fossils, we can better understand the arduous struggles that Sinanthropus Pekinensis went through in his life with these animals and the natural environment 500,000 years ago. Humans have grown up in continuous labor and continuous struggle. This provides unparalleled rich evidence for Engels' brilliant theory that "labor created man."
    These rich and valuable materials, unfortunately, suffered serious destruction during the years when the Japanese imperialists occupied Beijing. The Japanese imperialists occupied the research room in Beijing City, using it as a spy agency, and destroyed most of the fossils and other important materials. According to preliminary estimates, in addition to the materials of Sinanthropus Pekinensis and the Upper Cave Man, approximately 67 large boxes of other specimens, not including books and equipment, were lost. The original houses in Zhoukoudian were also destroyed during that period, and three staff members in Fangshan County were even shot, which is something that pains us greatly.
    Currently, all the fossils of Sinanthropus Pekinensis and the Upper Cave Man that were previously excavated have left China. Some people in the United States are responsible for this matter. That large batch of valuable materials was in the custody of Hutton, the former president of Peking Union Medical College, and Bowen, the chief administrator. After the Pearl Harbor incident, they were lost in their hands. This is a valuable cultural heritage of all mankind, and we believe that people all over the world and conscientious scholars will be concerned about this matter, hoping to get to the bottom of it and return the originals to their original place for further research.
    Thus, before liberation, the Zhoukoudian excavation had been interfered with, controlled, manipulated, and sabotaged by imperialists, and ultimately plundered. Here, in another sense, is presented a complete specimen, that is, a typical fossil of Chinese scientific research work itself, which suffered from imperialist cultural aggression before liberation.
    However, the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao have stood up. With the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Chinese people shattered the shackles of semi-colonial destiny, and China's scientific research work was also liberated. The Zhoukoudian work, which had been interrupted for twelve years, was immediately resumed after the liberation of Beijing in 1949. In 1951, a large-scale excavation was carried out, and five more teeth and some limb bones of Sinanthropus Pekinensis were obtained. We have also reorganized and restored the destroyed mountain areas, replanted trees, and built new offices, exhibition rooms, and reception rooms to welcome visitors from home and abroad. The highway from Beijing to Zhoukoudian has been surveyed and will soon be built, and is expected to be completed by the summer or autumn of next year. After the highway is completed, this world-renowned Zhoukoudian—the hometown of Sinanthropus Pekinensis—will surely become a scenic spot for tourism in the suburbs of Beijing.
    The Zhoukoudian excavation still has a great need to continue. It is estimated that there are many human fossils and other cultural relics buried in the soil, and there is a possibility of more abundant and large-scale harvests. However, due to the large-scale development of basic construction projects in New China, underground treasures are discovered everywhere, and our paleontological researchers and archaeological researchers are too few in number and completely overwhelmed. The limited manpower is dispersed for other tasks, so the Zhoukoudian work cannot be done with concentrated efforts. This is a gratifying thing on the one hand, and a regrettable thing on the other.
    But today, we have many gratifying things. In the past few years, we have had several new discoveries of old human sites in China. In 1952, during the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the skull of the Ziyang Man, who may have lived about 80,000 years ago, was discovered in Ziyang County, Sichuan Province. In June of this year, in the Huai River management project, fossils of relatively new old humans were also discovered in Sihong County, Anhui Province. These materials are currently being studied. Particularly noteworthy is the recent discovery of the Old Stone Age cultural site in Xiangfen County, Shanxi Province. This work was systematically excavated by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant local authorities in September and October of this year, and three human teeth, more than 2,000 stone tools and artificially struck stone blocks and flakes, and 25 types of animal fossils were discovered. According to preliminary judgment, although these cultural heritage and animal groups are younger than the Sinanthropus Pekinensis of Zhoukoudian, they are roughly comparable. That is to say, we have discovered another human site from the Middle Pleistocene, roughly 300,000 to 400,000 years ago. Comrade Jia Lanpo will give a special report on the excavation in Xiangfen County at this commemorative meeting, so I will not say more about it here.
    How did life originate and develop to reach all the stages it has today? How did mankind arise and develop to reach all the stages it has today? These questions have been noted since humans have had thoughts. At present, there is not much material on this aspect in the world, and the results of previous research are heavily colored with bourgeois idealism. To obtain a truly scientific answer, we still need to work hard in the future.
    Judging from the facts accumulated over the past 25 years, especially from the facts of the past five years, China is the country with the richest human fossils and Paleolithic culture, which is an indisputable fact. We grow up in such a good environment, and we grow up today when our thinking activities can be free from any idealist constraints. How should we work hard, actively enrich our strength, and be competent to assume the responsibility of answering questions?
    There is no doubt that we should intensify our study of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism, and strive to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to promote international academic and cultural exchanges.
    There is no doubt that we should intensify our training of new forces, strengthen our ranks of scientific researchers, strengthen unity, and strive to maintain close contact with the masses, so that our scientific research work today becomes truly worthy of the name of people's science.
    There is no doubt that we should strive to launch free academic discussions, launch criticism and self-criticism, and critically examine previous research, abandoning those incorrect parts and erroneous statements of bourgeois idealism.
    We are preparing to take this 25th anniversary of the discovery of the first Peking Man skull as a new beginning for new tasks. We must work diligently to study hard, work hard to support new forces, never be arrogant or complacent, and do our work well.
    China is not only rich in products, and the future of socialist construction has unlimited prospects;
    China's fossils of ancient vertebrates and even ancient humans are also very rich in underground burial, and the future of research on this science is also very bright.

    在中国猿人第一个头盖骨发现二十五周年纪念会上的报告
    郭沫若
    中国猿人北京种（Sinanthropus Pekinensis），即所谓“北京人”，他的第一个头盖骨发现于一九二九年十二月二日，到今年是二十五周年了。
    五十万年前的化石人类的发现，在科学研究上自然是很值得纪念的事。大家都知道，周口店的发掘工作在解放前是在帝国主义势力参加之下进行的，而在今天已经完全成为了人民的科学事业，这是首先值得庆贺的事。
    中国猿人化石地点的最初发现，我们不要忘记，是应当归功于当地的人民。在第一个头盖骨被发现之前也曾经发现过一些牙齿和头骨的碎片，在一九二七年发现了一个臼齿，由性质上的鉴定，已经命名为“中国猿人北京种”，但到一九二九年十二月二日，由裴文中同志发现了很完整的第一个头盖骨，这才奠定了中国猿人在科学上的坚实基础。
    周口店的初期发掘，由一九二七年起至一九三七年日本帝国主义者发动了侵华战争为止，一直不曾中断过。
    根据不完全的统计，在中国猿人地点一共发掘了一、八七三天，共一七八、九六五个工作日，在北京城内进行研究和修理的工作人员还没有包含在内。在中国猿人地点，挖去约两万立方公尺的岩石和砂土。在其他地点，挖去了四千二百立方公尺。像这样大规模的发掘，事实上是世界上空前未有的。
    这样大规模的发掘的结果，一共采获了一、二二一箱——约合三七五立方公尺的有待修理的标本。单是在发现中国猿人的第一地点，自从第一个头盖骨发现以后，就络续有大量的发现。中国猿人化石连解放以来后期的发掘成果在内，已有四十个上下的个体，包含五个比较完整的头骨，七个头骨碎片，两个上颚骨，十四个下颌骨，一百五十二个牙齿。还有一些破碎的肢骨，一个锁骨，三个肱骨，一个月骨，七个股骨，一个胫骨。同时出土的文化遗物，有旧石器和经过人工打击的石片和石块，一共有十万多件，还有用火的证迹。其他还有两种植物化石，一百一十八种动物化石—其中有九十四种哺乳动物，哺乳动物中有三十种是绝灭了。动物化石的丰富，有一部分是很惊人的，例如肿骨鹿和鬣狗都各有两千多个个体。
    关于人类化石，在今天所知道的材料，是以南洋的爪哇猿人和我们的“北京人”为最古。两者的年代相差不远，一般的推测认为爪哇猿人比较早些。但爪哇猿人最初发现的只三个牙齿，一个不完整的头盖骨，一个股骨，是否属于一个个体，尚无定论。虽然有少数的石器，而未发现出用火的证迹。其后受到周口店发掘的刺激，在一九二九年以后又曾继续发掘，得到四个头骨，也发现了新人类的化石，但和周口店遗物的丰富比较起来，仍然是大有逊色的。
    在过去二十几年中，周口店所发掘出的资料，由研究人员分别进行研究，已出版发表单篇论文的专册七十二种，共有四、三一○印刷页。一般性的论文和通俗性的文字还未计算在内。这些研究的成果，虽然夹杂着不少的资本主义国家的学者的工作在内，内容也少不了有大量的唯心论的说法，但由于材料的十分丰富，毕竟肯定了中国是世界人类化石最丰富的地区。所有有关材料对于进一步了解人类发展的历史，脊椎动物的演化过程，以及第四纪地层的地质，奠定了一定的基础。
    就人类发展来说，中国猿人是由猿到人的一个中间类型。同时发现的大批的旧石器和经过人工打击的石片石块以及用火的证迹，这些文化遗物可以充分反映中国猿人的生活情况。再从共生的许多动物化石来考察，我们更可以了解在五十万年前的中国猿人在生活中同这些动物和自然环境，是作过了怎样的艰苦的斗争。人类就是这样在不断的劳动、不断的斗争中成长起来的。这就为恩格斯“劳动创造了人”的天才的学说，找到了无比丰富的证据。
    这些丰富的宝贵的材料，在过去日本帝国主义者侵占了北京的岁月里，不幸曾经遭受了严重的摧毁。日本帝国主义者把当初在北京城内的研究室占据了，用作特务机关，把大部分的化石和其他重要的材料损毁了。据初步估计，除中国猿人和山顶洞人等材料外，其他标本约共损失了六十七大箱，图书设备等还不包含在内。周口店原有的房屋也在那一时期遭受摧毁，在房山县有三位工作人员更遭受枪杀，这是使我们十分痛心的事。
    目前所有以前所发掘出的中国猿人和山顶洞人的全部化石都已经离开了中国。关于这件事情，美国的一部分人要负责任。那一大批宝贵资料，是由前协和医学院的校长胡顿和总务长博文，这两位美国人在保管，在珍珠港事变后，是在他们的手里弄得下落不明的。这是全人类的宝贵的文化遗产，我们相信全世界的人民和有道义感的学者都会关心这件事情，希望把它弄个水落石出，把原物归还原处以便作更进一步的研究。
    就这样，在解放前周口店的发掘一直是受着帝国主义者的干预、把持、操纵、破坏，而终至于掠夺的。这儿又在别种意义上呈现出了一个完整的标本，那就是在解放前遭受着帝国主义文化侵略的中国科学研究工作本身的一个典型的化石。
    但是在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下的中国人民是站起来了。随着中国人民革命的伟大胜利，中国人民粉碎了半殖民地命运的枷锁，中国的科学研究工作也同样得到解放。中断了十二年的周口店工作，在一九四九年北京解放以后，便立即恢复了。一九五一年更曾经作过大规模的发掘，又络续得到中国猿人的五个牙齿和一些肢骨。我们还把摧毁了的山场整顿恢复了，重新培植了树木，新建了办公室、陈列室和招待室，以迎接国内外的参观者。由北京至周口店的公路已经测量完毕，即将进行修建，预计明年夏秋之交可以完工。公路修成后，这个世界知名的周口店——中国猿人的故乡，必将成为北京近郊的游览的胜境了。
    周口店的发掘还大有继续进行的必要，估计在土内埋藏的人类化石和其他文化遗品还很多，还有更丰富的大量收获的可能。但由于新中国基本建设事业大量的展开，随时随地都发现了地下的宝藏，我们的古生物研究工作者、考古学研究工作者为数实在太少，完全应接不暇，仅有的人力为其他的任务所分散，因而周口店的工作就不能够集中力量来做。这在当前，一面是可喜的事，一面也是可惜的事。
    但在我们今天，可喜的事实在多。几年来，我们在国内又有了好几处旧人类遗址的新发现。一九五二年在成渝铁路的修建工程中，在四川省资阳县发现了可能是八万左右年前的资阳人的头盖骨。今年六月，在治淮工程中，在安徽省泗洪县也发现了比较新的旧人类的化石。这些材料都正在进行研究中。特别值得注意的是最近在山西襄汾县的旧石器文化遗址的发现。这项工作，在今年九、十两月由中国科学院和地方有关机关作了有系统的发掘，发现了三个人类牙齿，两千多个石器和经过人工打击的石块和石片，二十五种动物化石。据初步判断，这些文化遗产和动物群，虽比周口店中国猿人年轻些，但大体上是可以相比的。那就是我们又发现了一个更新统中期约略三四十万年前的人类遗址。关于襄汾县的发掘，在本次纪念会上将由贾兰坡同志作专题报告，我在这里就不准备多说了。
    生物如何起源，如何发展，以达到今天所有的阶段？人类如何发生，如何发展，以达到今天所有的阶段？这些，自人类有思想以来，一直是被注意的问题。目前全世界关于这方面的材料还不很多，前人研究的成果也很浓厚地带着资产阶级唯心论的色彩，要想得出真正的科学的解答，还有待于我们今后的努力。
    由二十五年来积累的事实来看，特别由最近五年来的事实来看，中国是人类化石与古人类文化最丰富的国家，是无可争辩的事实。我们生长在这样好的环境里面，又生长在我们的思维活动可以不受任何唯心论束缚的今天，我们应该怎样努力，积极充实我们的力量，来胜任地担负起解答问题的责任呢？
    毫无疑问，我们应该加紧学习辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义，以马克思列宁主义来武装我们自己；并努力学习苏联先进经验，促进国际间的学术文化的交流。
    毫无疑问，我们应该加紧培养新生力量，壮大我们科学研究工作者的队伍，加强团结；并努力与群众密切联系，要使得我们今天的科学研究工作成为名实相符的人民科学。
    毫无疑问，我们应该努力展开学术上的自由讨论，展开批评和自我批评；对于以前的研究应该加以批判，抛弃那些不正确的部分，资产阶级唯心论的错误的说法。
    我们准备把这一次中国猿人第一个头盖骨发现二十五周年纪念会作为新的任务的新的开始，我们要勤勤恳恳地努力学习，努力扶植新生力量，决不骄傲自满，要好好做好工作。
    中国不仅物产丰富，社会主义建设的前途有无限的光明；
    中国的古脊椎动物乃至古人类化石在地下的埋藏也非常丰富，关于这一门科学的研究的前途也是非常光明的。
