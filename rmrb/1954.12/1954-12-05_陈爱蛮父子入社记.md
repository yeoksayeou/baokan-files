Record of Chen Ai'man and His Son Joining the Cooperative
任志浩　李维明

In Dongli Village, Taigu County, Shanxi Province, Chen Ai'man and his son, middle peasants who had refused to join the cooperative after three years of persuasion, have now voluntarily signed up to participate in the agricultural production cooperative.

On a dark night, we visited Chen Ai'man and his son. Chen Ai'man's son, Chen Erze, had a round face and a short, stocky build, giving the impression of being honest and simple. While we were talking to his father, he sat on the edge of the kang near the light, constantly interjecting to supplement some details that his father had forgotten or misspoken.

Unable to See the Depths
In the first month of 1952, Ren Erhuo and several other households, who had turned over in the land reform, established an agricultural production cooperative in Dongli Village to meet their production needs, following the path pointed out by the Communist Party. At that time, they began to mobilize Chen Ai'man to join the cooperative. However, Chen Ai'man felt that it was a "mostly ominous" matter, "absolutely not to be done." At the time, he thought: the agricultural cooperative is a cave of unknown depth; precisely because he couldn't see through it, he felt a little scared. "Since ancient times, even brothers born of the same mother can't get along and have to split up the family; I've never seen people from all over the place able to stir thin and thick gruel in the same pot." Therefore, when Ren Erhuo went to mobilize him to join the agricultural production cooperative, he directly refused: "Let others join first, I won't join yet." This was originally a normal matter, and it would have been fine if he didn't want to join, but Chen Ai'man felt it was an "ominous sign": people were jealous of his family property. After Ren Erhuo left, Ai'man began to tell his son Erze about the history of his hard work in building up the family fortune. Starting from when Erze's grandfather worked as a hired hand living in the landlord's house, to his frugality; he recounted moving from his old home in Yuci to Dongli Village to buy a house and land, the year he bought a large castrated ox, and the year he bought a large cart, counting them all out. Chen Ai'man didn't know how many times he had told his son about this situation, but he still felt it was of great significance; as if someone was going to seize his family property, so it was necessary to mobilize his son to protect it with all his might. He said, "Unlike Ren Erhuo and the others, they just mess around together, their family property was divided by raising their fists during the land reform. Our family property didn't come easily; it took several generations of hard work and suffering, saved from the cracks between our teeth." Chen Ai'man smiled and said to us, "At that time, I was just afraid that Erze was young and ignorant, and would accidentally kick and beat my family property." Afraid of benefitting from them

Last spring, Ren Erhuo and Chang Yuanze went to mobilize Chen Ai'man to join the cooperative again, but they were unsuccessful; he politely refused. He said, "I'm old, I can't bear the hardship of your agricultural cooperative (saying that the production labor in the cooperative is too strenuous), and Erze's body isn't strong enough, he'll be a burden if he joins." His tone was more polite, and there was a reason for it. Chen Ai'man said he particularly admired the agricultural cooperative's good methods for growing crops. Planting beans in sorghum fields has become an ancestral custom in the eastern mountains of Taigu, and every household does it this way, and no one has thought of changing it. After the agricultural cooperative changed the sorghum fields to pure sorghum planting and the bean fields to pure bean planting, each mu yielded more than one shi of sorghum than his. He began to feel that the agricultural cooperative still had something to be admired, and he couldn't directly oppose those cooperative cadres.

There were also reasons for refusing to join the cooperative. In terms of good crops and high yields, Chen Ai'man was quite clear about it; that was obvious, everyone could see it. But he secretly saw that the agricultural cooperative bought rubber-tired carts and mules; but not much was distributed to his own granary. Ren Erhuo only took home ten or twenty shi. Chen Ai'man said: "Although the crops of our father and son are not as good as the agricultural cooperative's, we steadily carry forty or fifty shi home. I see that there are 'more wolves than meat' in that cooperative, and there's not much left for each person." Regarding the public property purchased by the agricultural cooperative (such as rubber-tired carts, mules, etc.), he felt that it was the same as being confiscated, there was no guarantee like putting it in his own granary.

But what worried Chen Ai'man and his son the most was that the agricultural cooperative was so tightly controlled, it must be jealous of his few shi of grain. He thought to himself: if the agricultural cooperative sells the grain for money and buys mules and rubber-tired carts, there will definitely be nothing to eat in the spring; Ren Erhuo repeatedly mobilized him to join the cooperative because he was close to his few shi of grain; they were all opening their mouths waiting to eat and drink! The father and son calculated again and again, and the bottom line was: they must not join the cooperative for them to eat and drink. Because of this reason, the father and son secretly followed the cooperative's methods of growing crops on the one hand; and cautiously avoided approaching the cooperative on the other hand.

Wait and See Another Year
After a year, Chen Ai'man wholeheartedly believed in the superiority of the agricultural production cooperative. Not counting the grain that the cooperative members distributed to their homes, a small cooperative of nine households with two hundred and seventy mu of land sold a full 36,000 jin of grain to the state. He realized that fearing that the agricultural cooperative would open its mouth to eat and drink his grain was a baseless worry and overthinking. Speaking of livestock! The agricultural production cooperative brought back four tall mules from the supply and marketing cooperative at once, which were many times stronger than his castrated ox. As for carts, there were two rubber-tired carts, and one cart of manure was equal to two carts of his wooden-wheeled cart. Li Jucai, who only had thirty jin of sesame when he joined the cooperative, also changed greatly. It goes without saying that he lived well, and he also accumulated three or four hundred yuan of property in the cooperative. Comparing the property that Li Jucai received in the cooperative with the small family fortune that Chen Ai'man had struggled to build up for two or three generations, there wasn't much of a difference. Chen Ai'man thought again and again, the original terrifying feeling of mostly ominous events slowly disappeared; the question of whether to join the agricultural cooperative or not increasingly turned in his mind. Chen Ai'man said: "As soon as Ren Erhuo came to mobilize me, I had doubts again. I also felt that the reasons he gave were right, but I thought: would good things still need me to be mobilized again and again?! Besides, I usually haven't given them any benefits worth repaying like this! I was always afraid that they had bad intentions; and wanted me to take the blame for them. People often say 'partnering to get rich once or twice', but things will change over time, and it's not certain whether the agricultural cooperative can continue to be good for a long time. Therefore, I said to them, let's rely on each other for half a year and then talk about it, and I have to discuss it with my eldest son." "When the Cooperative is Not Bad"

The agricultural production cooperative was finally assessed by Chen Ai'man. His conclusion was: "There are livestock when you need livestock, and carts when you need carts, and the people are of one mind; there is no time when it is bad." No matter which way he looked at it, it didn't look like a "partnership to get rich quickly". His two eyes saw clearly that in previous years, the agricultural cooperative only put effort into growing crops, but this year, with more households and greater strength, sideline production also started. In less than half a year, they had raised thirty or forty pigs. It was also very convenient for the agricultural cooperative to have its own pigs during the holidays. This year, during the Dragon Boat Festival in May and the Mid-Autumn Festival, they slaughtered two pigs to celebrate the holidays for the cooperative members. Therefore, he said: "The agricultural cooperative is comfortable in every way." He was determined to join the cooperative. However, he originally planned to wait until after the autumn harvest, starting from next year, to start a new enterprise. The reason why he signed up to join the cooperative before autumn was triggered by his third son, Chen Sanhuo. Chen Sanhuo only had thirty or so mu of land, while Chen Ai'man and his son had more than forty mu; in the past, Chen Sanhuo's income never caught up with Chen Ai'man and his son, but this year Chen Sanhuo joined the agricultural production cooperative, and his income was more than a thousand jin more than Chen Ai'man and his son's. Comparing them this way, Chen Ai'man and his son figured out a principle: "It's better to join the cooperative early than late." He said: "Joining the cooperative means a larger income, and people open their mouths and say: my child is a cooperative member, and is walking the socialist path. The words that Ren Erhuo and Chang Yuanze said to me again and again when they mobilized me to join the cooperative, I think are more and more right now. I understand: joining the agricultural production cooperative means walking the path of common prosperity."

    陈爱蛮父子入社记
    任志浩　李维明
    在山西省太谷县东里村，过去动员说服了三年都不肯入社的中农陈爱蛮父子，现在自动报名参加了农业生产合作社。
    在一个漆黑的夜晚，我们访问了陈爱蛮父子。陈爱蛮的儿子叫陈二则，圆圆的脸，短粗个子，给人一种忠厚老实的感觉。在我们和他父亲说话时，他始终挨着灯亮坐在炕沿上，不断地插进来补充他父亲忘记和说错的一些细节。
    看不透深浅
    一九五二年正月，任二货等几户在土地改革中翻了身；落脚在东里村的贫雇农，因为生产上的需要，按照共产党指给的道路，碰伙成立了农业生产合作社。那时，他们就开始动员陈爱蛮老汉入社了。可是，陈爱蛮老汉觉得那是“凶多吉少”的事情，“万万做不得”。当时他想：农业社到底是个多深多浅的洞，是看不透的；就因为看不透，心里直觉得有些可怕。“自古以来，就是一个母亲生的亲哥儿兄弟，合不来还要分家，却没见过山南海北的张王李赵能在一口锅里搅稀稠。”因此，任二货去动员他参加农业生产合作社的时候，他就直接了当地拒绝了：“先叫别人入哇，我还不入。”这本来是件平常事情，不愿入也就算了，可是陈爱蛮老汉却觉得是一种“不祥之兆”：人们在眼热他的家产了。任二货走后，爱蛮老汉就对儿子二则讲述起他刻苦成家的历史来。直从二则他爷爷扛长工住主家说起，说到他的省吃俭用；把从榆次老家搬到东里村置房买地，那一年买了大犍牛，那一年又买了大车，都数划了一遍。这种情形，陈爱蛮老汉也不知道对儿子说了多少遍，但他仍然觉得有很重要的意义；就好像有人要抢夺他的家产，因此，很有必要动员儿子去全力保卫似的。他说：“不比任二货他们，人家搞到一块瞎折腾，人家的家业是土地改革的时候举拳头分下的。咱这份家业可来的不容易；好几辈子出力受苦，从牙缝里省下的。”陈爱蛮老汉笑了笑对我们说：“我那时候光怕二则人年轻不懂事，不小心把我这份家产给踢打了。”怕沾自己的光
    去年春天，任二货、畅元则又去动员陈爱蛮老汉入社，又没有成功；他婉言拒绝了。他说：“我老大的年纪，扛不下你们农业社那苦（说社里生产劳动的劲大），二则身体也不扎壮，进了里头是个累赘。”口气上和气了些，是有原因的。陈爱蛮老汉说他特别信服农业社养种庄稼的好办法。高粱地里带豆子，在太谷东山一带已经成了祖传的老习惯，家家户户都是这样，谁也没有想到还可以改变。农业社改成高粱地净种高粱、豆子地净种豆子后，一亩地就比他多收下一石多高粱。他开始觉得农业社还是有可取的地方，不可顶冲那些社务干部们。
    拒绝入社也不是没有原因的。论庄稼好打粮食多，陈爱蛮老汉心里是多少不含糊的；那是明摆的，谁也能看见了。可是他偷眼里瞧见，农业社又买胶皮车又买骡子；分到自家囤里的并不多。任二货也不过拿到家里十几二十石。陈爱蛮老汉说：“俺父子两个的庄稼虽然不胜农业社的，可是稳稳当当地扛回家里四五十石。我看那社里是‘狼多肉少’，落在一个人头上也就没多少了。”对于农业社置买下的公共财产（如胶皮车、骡子等），他觉得和充了公一样，那有放到自己囤囤里保险。
    不过最使陈爱蛮父子担心的是，农业社这样盘得他紧，必定是眼热他的那几石粮食。他心里捉摸：农业社把粮食卖了钱，买成骡子和胶皮车，到春困时候必定是个没吃的；任二货三番五次动员他入社，就是和他那几石粮食亲；都张开嘴等着吃喝哩！父子两个盘算来盘算去，归根结底是：千万不能入社给他们去吃喝。就因为这原因，父子两个一方面偷偷地照着社里的方法种庄稼；一方面又小心地躲着不敢挨近社。
    再看一年
    去年一年下来，陈爱蛮老汉不折不扣地信服了农业生产合作社的优越性。社员们分到家里的粮食不算数，九户人家、二百七十亩地的一个小社，就整整装装地卖给国家三万六千斤粮食。他知道了，怕农业社张开嘴吃喝他的粮食，是瞎担忧多操心。说牲口吧！农业生产合作社一次就从供销合作社里牵回四头展手高的大骡子，和他的大犍牛比较起来，不知道要强多少倍。论车子是胶皮车两辆，送一车粪顶他的木轮大车两车。入社时只有三十斤芝麻的李聚才也大大变了样，光景过得好不用说，在社里还积累下三四百万元的财产，去年把老婆也娶上了。拿李聚才在社里分到的财产和陈爱蛮老汉受了两三辈子苦才闹起来的小家业比较，也差不下啥大数。陈爱蛮左思右想，原先那种凶多吉少的恐怖心理，慢慢消除了；是不是要参加农业社的问题，也越来越多地在脑子里转起圈子来了。陈爱蛮老汉说：“任二货一来动员，我心里就又起了疑惑。他讲的道理我也觉得对，可是我又想：好事情还用三番五次地盘我去吗？！再说，我往常也没有给了他们什么值得这样来报答的好处呀！老怕他们打了坏主意；让我给他们背锅底。人常说‘搭伙发财一二回’，时间长了就要出变故，农业社是不是能长期好下去，还不一定。因此，我对他们说，靠上一半年再说哇，还得和我那大孩子商量商量。”“社没有坏的时候”
    农业生产合作社在陈爱蛮老汉的心目中总算考准了。他的结论是：“要牲口有牲口，要车有车，人又心齐；没有坏的时候。”不论他从那一头看，也不像是“搭伙发横财”的劲头。他两只眼睛看得清楚，往年价农业社还只是在种庄稼上下劲，今年户数多力量大，副业生产也搞起来了，没有半年就喂下三四十只猪，过个节气，农业社自己有猪也很方便；今年过五月端午，中秋节，就宰倒两口猪给社员过节。因此，他说：“农业社是那一头也过得褥贴。”下定决心要入社了。不过，他原是打算秋收完毕，从明年开始，好重打锣鼓另开戏的。他秋前报名入社，却是从他老三陈三货身上引起的。陈三货只有三十来亩地，陈爱蛮父子有四十多亩；以往陈三货的收入那一年也赶不上陈爱蛮父子，今年陈三货加入了农业生产合作社，收入反倒比陈爱蛮父子两个的多一千来斤。这么一比较，陈爱蛮父子弄清楚了一个道理：“早入社比迟入社好。”他说：“入社收入大，人们张口合口还说：伢是社员，走的是社会主义的道路。任二货、畅元则三番五次盘我入社的时候说的那些话，我这时候越想越对了。我算懂得了：入了农业生产合作社就是走大家富裕的道路。”
