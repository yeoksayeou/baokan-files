Shandong and Hunan Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Actively Sell Industrial Products

    In order to rapidly organize the flow of industrial products to the countryside and support the procurement of agricultural products, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Shandong Province are actively organizing the purchase of goods and vigorously expanding sales. According to statistics from the supply and marketing cooperatives in the Laiyang, Wendeng, Tai'an, and Dezhou special districts, sales plans have been expanded by 135.4 billion yuan. After surveying farmers' needs, the No. 1 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fei County added more than 100 new commodities. At the materials supply work conference convened by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Tai'an Special District Commissioner's Office, the supply and marketing cooperatives of various counties purchased more than 30 billion yuan worth of goods from state-owned companies. The Tangyi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has signed 52 purchase contracts with state-owned companies, totaling 2.3 billion yuan. Many local supply and marketing cooperatives have also convened meetings for the production and sale of handicrafts. In QuFu County alone, the supply and marketing cooperatives of three districts purchased handicrafts worth more than 38 million yuan through production and sales meetings.
    In sales work, various localities widely adopted methods welcomed by the masses, such as holding small-scale materials exchange fairs, holding commodity exhibitions, taking goods to the countryside for promotion, and setting up stalls. Recently, the supply and marketing cooperatives of four counties in the Jiaozhou Special District, including Gaomi, Wulian, Zhucheng, and Cangma, organized more than 30 materials exchange fairs using old mountain fairs and market days, with sales worth 4 billion yuan, an increase of one to three times compared to normal sales. Recently, 47 retail stores of the Gaomi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative went to the countryside 220 times to deliver goods and set up stalls 300 times, selling a total of 880 million yuan worth of goods. In the five days of mid-November, the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Yuncheng County held 16 small-scale materials exchange fairs, with total sales of 120 million yuan. In addition, the supply and marketing cooperative of this county also transferred more than 30 cadres to form 10 mobile teams to deliver goods to the countryside. The retail sales volume of the province's supply and marketing cooperatives in the first ten days of November increased by 18.97 percent compared with the first ten days of October. (Lu Jianmin)
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Hunan Province are actively selling industrial products to support the procurement of agricultural products. The sales volume of commodities by the province's supply and marketing cooperatives increased by 3.32 percent in late October compared to mid-October, and by another 10.29 percent in early November compared to late October.
    In the sales campaign, many supply and marketing cooperatives paid attention to improving their business methods and improving their service attitude. In the past, the fabric sales department of the No. 10 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hanshou County did not display many goods, and only ten or so bolts of cloth were placed on the shelves. After the sales campaign, 80 bolts of cloth were placed on the shelves, and the facade was also renovated. Some time ago, this sales department only sold more than 4 million yuan per day, but now it sells more than 6 million yuan per day. After launching the sales campaign, the No. 7 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Linxiang County prepared for the next day's sales every night, so that customers could "buy whatever they wanted whenever they arrived." The No. 1 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Tongdao Dong Autonomous County rationally adjusted the labor organization. The department for general merchandise, fabrics, oil, and salt was busier for a period of time every afternoon, so the leaders of the supply and marketing cooperative sent people to assist in sales on time. In addition, a special person was assigned to deliver goods to the countryside. Fu Zhulin, a salesperson at the No. 4 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Linxiang County, had never completed his personal sales plan in the past because he was not dedicated to his work and had a blunt service attitude. After checking his service attitude, he treated purchasing members patiently, and his sales volume increased day by day. (Hunan Reporter Station of this newspaper)

    山东湖南两省供销合作社积极销售工业品
    山东省各级供销合作社为迅速组织工业品下乡，支持农产品收购工作，现正积极组织进货，大力展开销售工作。据莱阳、文登、泰安、德州四个专区供销合作社的统计，销售计划已经扩大了一千三百五十四亿元。费县第一区供销合作社调查了农民的需要以后，增加了一百多种新商品。泰安专区各县供销合作社在专署财政经济委员会召开的物资供应工作会议上，向国营公司购进三百多亿元的货物；堂邑县供销合作社已经同国营公司签订五十二份进货合同，总值二十三亿元。不少地区的供销合作社还召开了手工业产销会议。仅曲阜县三个区供销合作社，就通过产销会议购进价值三千八百多万元的手工业产品。
    在销货的工作中，各地广泛采用了举行小型物资交流会、举行商品展览会、带货下乡推销、摆设货摊等群众欢迎的方式。胶州专区高密、五莲、诸城、藏马等四个县的供销合作社最近利用旧山会和集日，组织了三十多次物资交流总会，销货值有四十亿元，比平日销货额扩大一倍到三倍。高密县四十七个供销合作社零售店最近下乡送货二百二十次，逢集摆摊三百次，共销出八亿八千万元的货物。郓城县各基层供销合作社在十一月中旬的五天中，召开了十六次小型物资交流会，销货总值有一亿二千万元；另外，这个县的供销合作社还抽调三十多名干部组织了十个流动小组下乡送货。全省供销合作社十一月上旬的零售销货额比十月上旬增加了百分之十八点九七。　　　　（卢健民）
    湖南省各地供销合作社积极销售工业品，支持农产品收购工作。全省供销合作社商品销售额，十月下旬比中旬上升百分之三点三二，十一月上旬又比十月下旬上升了百分之十点二九。
    在销货运动中，许多供销合作社注意改进经营方法，改善了服务态度。汉寿县第十区供销合作社布疋门市部过去有很多货没有陈列出来，货架上只放着十来疋布；开展销货运动以后，货架上摆了八十疋布，门面也装饰一新。前些日子，这个门市部每天只卖四百多万元，现在每天卖六百多万元。临湘县第七区供销合作社开展销货运动以后，每天晚上作好第二天销货的准备工作，使顾客能“随到随买”。通道侗族自治县第一区供销合作社合理地调整了劳动组织。百货布疋、油盐部每天下午有一段时间业务较忙，供销合作社领导方面便派人按时协助售货；另外，还抽出专人送货下乡。临湘县第四区供销合作社营业员傅竹林，过去因为不安心工作，服务态度生硬，从来没有完成过个人销货计划；经过检查服务态度以后，耐心对待购货社员，销货额逐日上升。　　　　（本报湖南记者站）
