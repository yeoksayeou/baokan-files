    Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area in Hubei Province has an ample supply of grain. Currently, Sichuan rice is still being continuously transported to the flood diversion area. Up to November, the amount of grain transported from other areas to Jingjiang County has exceeded more than twice the total amount of grain purchased by Jingjiang County last year. When the ships loaded with grain arrive at the wharves in various parts of the flood diversion area, nearby farmers go to help unload and transport it. In order to do a good job in grain supply, the Jingjiang County People's Government has set up many grain supply stations throughout the county and simplified the supply procedures. The farmers in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area have also formulated plans to save grain. They have planted more than 11,000 mu of vegetables in the vacant land next to their houses to save grain.

    荆江分洪区粮食供应充裕
    湖北省荆江分洪区粮食供应充裕。目前，四川大米还在源源运往分洪区。到十一月份止，由外地运往荆江县的粮食已超过荆江县去年粮食收购总数两倍多。当满载着粮食的船只到达分洪区各地码头的时候，附近的农民有的前往帮助卸、运。为了作好粮食供应工作，荆江县人民政府在全县设立了许多粮食供应站，并且简化了供应手续。荆江分洪区农民也订出了节约粮食的计划，他们利用屋旁空地种了一万一千多亩蔬菜，以节约粮食。（新华社）
