    National Winter Wheat Sowing Completed as Planned
    Rural Areas in Gansu Province Launch Winter Production Activities
    [Report from this newspaper] The national winter wheat sowing work has concluded successively from north to south. All regions have followed national requirements to stabilize the total wheat field area at last year's level. This year's wheat planting area was appropriately adjusted according to the national plan, with a slight reduction in wheat fields in northern areas suitable for cotton planting, and an expansion of wheat field areas in the south. The total winter wheat area reached over 350 million mu.
    This year's wheat planting work was carried out amid the great development of the cooperative movement across the country. Tens of thousands of new and old agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams guided farmers to plant in accordance with the national plan and improved wheat planting techniques. All regions paid special attention to the promotion of close planting techniques. In major wheat-producing areas in the north, in order to help farmers implement close planting, they organized the training of a large number of carpenters to go to the countryside to modify plows for the masses. According to incomplete statistics from Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi provinces, more than 100,000 close planting plows were modified, so the close planting area this year greatly exceeded previous years. The close planting area in Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces accounted for more than 30% of the total wheat field area. All regions also actively expanded the area of improved varieties. According to incomplete statistics from Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, and other provinces, the area of improved wheat varieties expanded to more than 80 million mu this year. In addition, improvements have been made in seed dressing and soaking, and the prevention and control of underground pests compared with previous years. Currently, the wheat seedlings are growing well. Recently, major wheat-producing areas have received snowfall, which is very beneficial to wheat growth next year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 17th: Rural areas in Gansu Province are focusing on mutual aid and cooperative organizations to carry out winter production activities in full swing. Most of the province's existing 700-plus agricultural production cooperatives have formulated production plans for this winter or next year. The seven agricultural production cooperatives in Zhangzheng Township, Yongning County, stipulated that each member should accumulate five large carts of fertilizer by burning kang (heated brick bed) during the winter, and stipulated that all livestock pens should be lined with soil every three days to accumulate manure. In addition, the cooperatives have also launched winter sideline production such as transportation, firewood gathering, and hemp rope making. Transportation alone is expected to generate an income of about 100 million yuan. The Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingliang County plans to organize 30 laborers to weave more than 100,000 dustpans and cattle muzzle covers, preparing to exchange them for four new-style walking plows, one powder sprayer, and more than 200 other farm tools. In late November, the Siping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jingning County held a meeting of its members to review winter production; the entire cooperative has accumulated more than 300 carts of fertilizer and expanded the winter irrigation area by more than 80 hectares. The broad masses of mutual aid teams are also busy with winter production. Some mutual aid teams are also preparing to transition into agricultural production cooperatives. The 20 mutual aid teams in Qingya Township, Wudu County, have all formulated winter production plans, requiring that manure and soil be well accumulated, seedlings be well protected, winter grass be well stored, livestock be well fed, and farm tools and roads be well repaired.

    全国冬麦播种工作按计划完成
    甘肃省各地农村展开冬季生产活动
    【本报讯】全国冬小麦播种工作已从北到南先后结束。各地均按照国家要求，使麦田总面积稳定在去年水平。今年种麦面积根据国家计划作了适当调整，北方适宜植棉地区的麦田适当缩小，南方麦田面积有了扩大。冬麦总面积达到三亿五千多万亩。
    今年种麦工作是在全国合作化运动大发展的情况下进行的。成千成万的新老农业合作社和互助组带动农民按照国家计划进行种植，并改进了种麦技术。各地特别重视密植技术的推广，北方主要产麦地区，为了帮助农民实行密植，组织训练了大批木匠下乡为群众改耧，据陕西、河南、山西三省不完全的统计，改制了十多万张密植耧，因而今年密植面积大大超过往年。河北、山东等省的密植面积达麦田总面积百分之三十以上。各地并积极扩大了良种面积，据山东、河南、陕西、山西、四川等省不完全统计，今年小麦良种面积扩大到八千多万亩。此外在拌种浸种，防治地下害虫等方面都比往年有所提高。目前麦苗生长良好。最近主要产麦地区均下了雪，这对于明年小麦生长十分有利。
    据新华社兰州十七日电：甘肃省各地农村正以互助合作组织为中心，紧张开展冬季生产活动。全省现有的七百多个农业生产合作社，大多订出了今年冬季或明年的生产计划，永宁县掌政乡的七个农业生产合作社规定每个社员冬季要利用烧炕积肥五大车；并规定所有牲口圈三天垫土一次，积攒厩肥。此外，各社并展开了运输、打柴、打麻绳等冬季副业生产。仅运输一项，预计就可收入一亿元左右。平凉县光明农业生产合作社计划组织三十个劳动力编笊篱、牛笼嘴十万多个，准备换回新式步犁四部、喷粉器一架和其他农具二百多件。静宁县四屏农业生产合作社十一月下旬召开社员大会，对冬季生产进行了检查；全社已积肥三百多车，并扩大了冬灌面积八十多垧。广大互助组也在忙着进行冬季生产。有些互助组还准备转为农业生产合作社。武都县青崖乡二十个互助组都订出了冬季生产计划，要求把粪土积攒好，青苗保护好，冬草储备好，牲口喂养好，农具、道路修理好。
