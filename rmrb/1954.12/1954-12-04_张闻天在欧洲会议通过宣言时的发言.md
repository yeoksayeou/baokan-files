Comrades,

    The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that after detailed discussions on the new situation created by the Western countries' conclusion of the Paris Agreement, which aims to arm West Germany, drag it into an aggressive military bloc, and prepare for war, it is very necessary and timely for the countries participating in this Moscow Conference to issue a joint declaration. The declaration before us has appropriately analyzed and assessed the current situation and pointed out the correct path for resolving the German question and establishing a European collective security system. If the parties concerned have the sincerity to resolve the German question on the basis of peace and democracy and to seek European peace and security, then even now, a reasonable solution to the German question and the issue of European peace and security can still be found. However, if the Paris Agreement is ratified, then the peace-loving countries concerned must take new measures, as proposed in the declaration, to ensure peace and their own security. Therefore, close attention must be paid to the future development of the European situation, and full preparations must be made to deal with any possible sudden changes.

    On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, I express my warm welcome to the adoption of this declaration at the Moscow Conference, and I declare that the People's Republic of China fully agrees with this declaration and firmly supports the propositions put forward in the declaration. We believe that the decisions of the Moscow Conference will have a significant impact on the cause of safeguarding European peace and security.

    张闻天在欧洲会议通过宣言时的发言亲爱的同志们：
    中华人民共和国政府认为，这次莫斯科会议在详细讨论了由于西方国家缔结了旨在武装西德和把它拉入侵略性的军事集团并准备战争的巴黎协定所造成的新的形势后，由与会各国发表一项联合宣言，是非常必要和适时的。摆在我们面前的这一项宣言，已经恰当地分析和估计了当前的形势，指出了解决德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系的正确道路。如果有关各国有在和平民主的基础上解决德国问题以及谋取欧洲和平和安全的诚意，那么即使在现在，德国问题和欧洲和平与安全问题也还是能够求得合理解决的。但是，如果巴黎协定竟得到批准，那么，爱好和平的有关国家为了保障和平和自身的安全，就必须采取像宣言中所提出的新的措施。因此，必须密切注意欧洲局势今后的发展，并充分准备着应付一切可能发生的突然事变。
    我代表中华人民共和国政府对这次莫斯科会议通过这一宣言表示热烈的欢迎，并声明中华人民共和国完全同意这一宣言，坚决支持宣言中所提出的主张。我们相信，莫斯科会议的决定必将对保障欧洲和平和安全的事业发生巨大影响。
