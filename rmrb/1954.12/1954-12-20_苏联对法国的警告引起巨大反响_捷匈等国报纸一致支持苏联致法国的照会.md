Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: Newspapers in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria unanimously support the Soviet government's note to the French government.

Czechoslovak newspapers' editorials emphasized that if the French National Assembly approves the Paris Agreements, France will be responsible for the situation in Europe. "Red Rights" newspaper said: The Czechoslovak people, along with all peace-loving people in Europe, believe that fulfilling the Franco-Soviet Treaty is a great contribution to the cause of peace in Europe and to the cause of establishing friendly relations between countries. Our people condemn the French ruling clique for trampling on their obligations, trying their best to collude with the Nazi "Wehrmacht," and tearing up the Potsdam Agreement and the Franco-Soviet Treaty.

Hungarian central newspapers published the full text of the Soviet government's note on the 17th. "Hungarian National Newspaper" emphasized that the Soviet government made it very clear that the approval of the Paris Agreements would invalidate the Franco-Soviet Treaty.

Bulgarian newspapers published the Soviet government's note on the front page with large headlines. "Workers' Affairs" published an editorial entitled "A Serious Warning," saying: France must either maintain the Franco-Soviet Treaty to oppose the revival of German militarism, or form an alliance with this deadly enemy against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet government's note is fully in line with the vital interests of the peace-loving people of European countries and the world, because it helps the struggle against the revival of German militarism and against instigating a new war.

Polish newspapers all commented on the Soviet note. The newspapers pointed out that the Soviet warning to France has already had a huge impact on the world.

Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: According to TASS: Many newspapers in West Berlin, as well as in Italy, Denmark, and Greece, have published news and comments about the Soviet government's note to the French government on the 16th.

West Berlin newspapers emphasized that the Soviet government stated that France's signing of the Paris Agreements violated its obligations under the Franco-Soviet Treaty; if France approves the Paris Agreements, it will be necessary to abolish the Franco-Soviet Treaty.

The Moscow correspondent of the Italian "Unità" wrote: The Soviet note points out that the Franco-Soviet Treaty and the Paris Agreements are incompatible. The former is aimed at the revival of German militarism and the possibility of new aggression from Germany, while the latter is to revive German militarism. If France participates in the Paris Agreements, it will be sentencing the Franco-Soviet alliance to death; France's ability to defeat the Nazi aggressors in World War II and its current ability to become an independent country again are largely due to the Franco-Soviet alliance.

The Italian "Avanti!" and "Nazione" also emphasized that if the Paris Agreements are approved, France will bear a great responsibility. "Nazione" believes that the fact that the Defense Committee of the French National Assembly rejected the report in favor of approving the Paris Agreements is of great significance, indicating that "the plan to rearm West Germany has already aroused deep consternation, or to be more precise, fierce reactions, among French parliamentarians and military figures."

The Italian bourgeois newspaper "Corriere della Sera" published a dispatch from Paris anxiously pointing out that the Soviet note "caused repercussions in France."

The Danish "Land og Folk" pointed out in its commentary: The new step taken by the Soviet government shows how dangerous peace is in the current situation due to the policies of Western countries.

The Athens-based "Aki" newspaper described the content of the Soviet note under a prominent headline. The Athens "Forum" said that the Soviet note is "the most serious warning to France among the many measures taken by the Soviet Union so far against the ratification of the Paris Agreements."

    苏联对法国的警告引起巨大反响
    捷匈等国报纸一致支持苏联致法国的照会
    【新华社十九日讯】捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、匈牙利和保加利亚报纸一致支持苏联政府致法国政府的照会。
    捷克斯洛伐克各报社论着重指出：如果法国国民议会批准巴黎协定，法国就要对欧洲局势负责。“红色权利报”说：捷克斯洛伐克人民同欧洲一切爱好和平的人民都认为履行法苏条约就是对欧洲和平事业、对各国建立友好关系的事业的一大贡献。我国人民谴责法国统治集团践踏自己的义务、竭力同纳粹“国防军”勾搭并且撕毁波茨坦协定和法苏条约。
    匈牙利中央一级报纸十七日刊载了苏联政府照会全文。“匈牙利民族报”着重指出：苏联政府说得十分明白，批准巴黎协定就要使法苏条约失效。
    保加利亚各报在第一版用大标题登载了苏联政府的照会。“工人事业报”以“严重的警告”为题发表社论说：法国或者是保持法苏条约以反对复活德国军国主义，或者是同这个死敌结成反对苏联和人民民主国家的同盟。这家报纸指出：苏联政府的照会完全符合欧洲各国和全世界爱好和平的人民的切身利益，因为它有助于反对复活德国军国主义、反对策动新战争的斗争。
    波兰各报都评论苏联的照会。报纸指出：苏联对法国的警告已经在世界上产生了巨大影响。
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社讯：西柏林以及意大利、丹麦和希腊的许多报纸都刊载了有关苏联政府十六日给法国政府的照会的消息，并且发表了评论。
    西柏林的报纸着重指出：苏联政府表示：法国签订巴黎协定就违背了它在法苏条约中所承担的义务；如果法国批准巴黎协定，就有必要废除法苏条约。
    意大利“团结报”驻莫斯科记者写道：苏联照会指出了法苏条约和巴黎协定是不相容的。前者是针对着德国军国主义的复活和可能来自德国的新侵略的，而后者是要复活德国军国主义的。法国如果参加巴黎协定，就是宣判法苏联盟的死刑；而法国在第二次世界大战中所以能够战胜纳粹侵略者以及现在所以能够重新成为一个独立的国家，在很大程度上要归功于法苏联盟。
    意大利“前进报”和“国家报”也着重指出：如果巴黎协定获得批准，法国要负很大责任。“国家报”认为：法国国民议会国防委员会否决了赞成批准巴黎协定的报告，这件事有重大的意义，它表明了“重新武装西德的计划已经在法国议会和军界人士中引起了深刻的惊恐，或者说得确切些，引起了激烈的反应。”
    意大利资产阶级的“报信者报”刊载的来自巴黎的电讯担心地指出：苏联照会“在法国引起了回声”。
    丹麦“国土与人民报”在评论中指出：苏联政府的新步骤说明：由于西方国家的政策，和平正处在何等危险的境地。
    在雅典出版的“阿基报”在醒目的标题下叙述了苏联照会的内容。雅典“论坛报”说：苏联照会是“直到现在为止苏联所采取的许多反对批准巴黎协定的措施中对法国最严重的警告”。
