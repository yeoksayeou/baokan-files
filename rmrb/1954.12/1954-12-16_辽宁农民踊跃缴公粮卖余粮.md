Liaoning Province's farmers are actively paying agricultural tax in kind and enthusiastically selling surplus grain. According to incomplete statistics, as of December 6th, the amount of agricultural tax in kind stored in warehouses throughout the province has reached 118,720 tons, and the amount of grain purchased through the unified purchase system that has been stored in warehouses has reached 255,775 tons. Farmers in the suburbs of Lüda Municipality have completed the task of paying agricultural tax in kind. In Changtu County, more than 79% of the grain purchased through the unified purchase system has been stored in warehouses.

Farmers in Liaoning Province warmly support the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. According to the amount of surplus grain that farmers have voluntarily reported for sale in various regions, the total amount of grain purchased in the province this year may exceed the original plan by 95,000 tons. The amount of grain that farmers in five districts of Gaiping County voluntarily reported to sell exceeds the original plan by 1,142 tons. Now, the vast majority of farmers are collectively transporting agricultural tax in kind and the surplus grain they are selling to the state granaries. The Xianyang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Biluhe Village, Third District of Xinjin County, consisting of 29 households, sold a total of 70 *shi* of surplus grain to the state. On December 2nd, they carried a portrait of Chairman Mao, beat drums and gongs, and performed the *yangge* dance, transporting the grain to the state granary located in Chengzituan. The grain-transporting procession passed through more than a dozen villages and was welcomed by farmers along the way. Many farmers said: It is glorious to participate in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations and produce more grain, and it is even more glorious to sell more grain.

    辽宁农民踊跃缴公粮卖余粮
    辽宁省广大农民积极缴纳公粮，踊跃出卖余粮。据不完全统计到十二月六日，全省入库公粮已经有十一万八千七百二十吨，统购粮食入库的已经有二十五万五千七百七十五吨。旅大市郊农民已经完成了缴纳公粮的任务；昌图县统购粮食百分之七十九以上已经入库。
    辽宁省农民热烈拥护粮食统购统销政策，按照各地农民自报出售的余粮计算，今年全省购粮数量可以超过原订计划九万五千吨。盖平县五个区的农民自报卖粮的数量，就超过原计划一千一百四十二吨。现在广大农民正集体把公粮和出卖的余粮送入国家粮库。新金县第三区碧流河村鲜阳农业生产合作社二十九户社员，一共卖给国家七十石余粮。十二月二日，他们抬着毛主席像，敲锣打鼓，扭着秧歌，把粮食送入设在城子疃的国家粮库。送粮的队伍经过了十几个屯子，受到沿途农民的欢迎。许多农民说：参加农业生产互助合作组织，多打粮食光荣，多卖粮食更光荣。               （本报辽宁记者站）
