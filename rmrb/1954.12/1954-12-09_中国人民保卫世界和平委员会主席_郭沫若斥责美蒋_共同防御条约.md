    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace,
    Denounces the US-Chiang "Joint Defense Treaty"
    [This newspaper report] Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, made a statement to a "Guangming Daily" reporter on the issue of the so-called "Joint Defense Treaty" signed by the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique:
    The US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique have recently brazenly signed the so-called "Joint Defense Treaty." This is a deed of sale of Taiwan written by the Chiang Kai-shek traitor, who has consistently sold out the sovereignty of the motherland's territory. This is a handwritten confession of the invasion of Chinese territory written by the American imperialist warmongering group, who have consistently invaded China. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan, and if the American bandits and the Chiang Kai-shek traitors think they can use this "treaty" to intimidate us, they will only be disappointed.
    Liberating Taiwan is a just action. Liberating Taiwan is to defend the security and territorial integrity of our motherland, and also to defend peace in Asia and the world. To defend peace, we must oppose aggression. As long as the forces of aggression exist, peace will be threatened; the Chinese people have a deep understanding of this.
    We love peace, but we have never feared wars of anti-aggression. If the aggressor does not change its aggressive policy, it will inevitably be severely punished.
    In short, the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan. Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are an inseparable part of our motherland, and we will never allow our territory to continue to be occupied by American bandits under the pretext of protecting traitors.
    The more than seven million Taiwanese compatriots under the bloody rule of the US-Chiang regime must be extremely indignant upon seeing this criminal treaty signed by the US-Chiang regime. Please unite more closely and prepare for revenge. Those who fled to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek should also realize that this is the best time for them to save themselves and serve the motherland.
    The evil actions of the US imperialist warmongers in undermining peace and infringing upon China's territorial sovereignty will inevitably lead to their own destruction. I also earnestly hope that all peace-loving American people, in order to protect their own interests and avoid greater war disasters, should express the power of the people as soon as possible and stop these dishonorable acts of aggression by the warmongers.

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席
    郭沫若斥责美蒋“共同防御条约”
    【本报讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若就美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”问题向“光明日报”记者发表谈话说：
    美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团最近公然签订了所谓“共同防御条约”。这是一贯出卖祖国领土主权的蒋介石卖国贼写了一张出卖台湾的文契。这是一贯侵略中国的美帝国主义好战集团写了一张侵占中国领土的亲笔供状。中国人民是一定要解放台湾的，美国强盗和蒋介石卖国贼如果想以这个“条约”来恫吓一下，那是只能使他失望。
    解放台湾是正义的行动，解放台湾是为了保卫我们祖国的安全和领土的完整，同时也是为了保卫亚洲和全世界的和平。要保卫和平，就必须反对侵略，侵略势力存在一天，和平就要受到威胁；中国人民对这一点是有深切体会的。
    我们是热爱和平的，但我们从来也不惧怕反侵略的战争。假使侵略者死不改变它的侵略政策，那他就必将受到严重的惩罚。
    总之，中国人民是一定要解放台湾的。台湾和澎湖列岛是我们祖国的不可分割的一部分，我们决不能容许自己的领土继续遭受美国强盗在保护卖国贼的借口之下实行霸占。
    处在美蒋血腥统治下的七百多万台湾同胞们看到美蒋签订的这个罪恶条约一定是无比愤慨的。请更加紧密地团结起来作雪耻的准备。跟随蒋贼逃到台湾去的人们现在也应该认识到，这是他们拯救自己、报效祖国的最好时机了。
    美帝国主义好战分子这种破坏和平、侵犯中国领土主权的罪恶行动，其结果必然是自取灭亡。我也热望所有爱好和平的美国人民，为了保卫自己的利益，免除更大的战争灾害，应当及早表现人民的力量，制止好战分子们这种不荣誉的侵略行动。
