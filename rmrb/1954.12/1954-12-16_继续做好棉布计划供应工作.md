Continue to Do a Good Job in the Planned Supply of Cotton Cloth

The implementation of the planned supply of cotton cloth has yielded preliminary achievements in the two months since its implementation. It effectively guarantees the basic needs of urban and rural people for cotton cloth; it has transformed the free market for cotton cloth, bringing tens of thousands of private cotton cloth merchants basically into the orbit of state capitalism.

When the planned supply of cotton cloth began to be implemented, some people had various concerns, fearing that the supply quota would not be enough, that they would not be able to buy good cloth, that cloth prices would rise, and that they would not be able to freely choose varieties and qualities. After more than two months of factual education, these concerns have been dispelled, and the vast majority of people are satisfied with the planned supply of cotton cloth. This is because the quantity supplied by voucher is sufficient, the cloth tickets are valid for a long time, the price of cotton cloth is stable, and there are no restrictions on colors and varieties, fully taking into account the convenience and interests of consumers; in particular, the regulations for providing extra care for special cloth needs such as birth, marriage, and death, embodies the spirit of the People's Government's meticulous concern for the people's lives.

However, the planned supply of cotton cloth is an extremely complex and arduous new task. The current publicity and education are not yet in-depth, and the supply work lacks experience. Therefore, some problems still exist that need to be further resolved. Some of these are problems related to the masses' lack of understanding of the planned supply policy, such as why is there such a big difference between urban and rural quotas? Some are shortcomings in the work, such as insufficient care for the special difficulties of individual consumers; private cotton cloth merchants have not been properly arranged; and state-owned commercial employees have poor service attitudes, etc. These all need to be further explained to the masses and efforts made to improve them in the work. We must not relax and become complacent or blindly satisfied because the planned supply of cotton cloth has already achieved some results.

Some comrades working in rural areas and some farmers, seeing that the rural quotas are low, especially for some people with high consumption, the supply quota cannot meet their needs. Therefore, they have some opinions on the difference between urban and rural planned supply quotas of cotton cloth. This needs to be explained to them clearly. First of all, it is necessary to explain to them that the planned supply quota of cotton cloth is not a political treatment, but is stipulated on the basis of the original consumption level of urban and rural people, according to the principle of less increase in cities and more increase in rural areas. This principle conforms to the policy of gradually increasing the level of cotton cloth consumption, and also conforms to the actual needs of urban and rural people. Secondly, it is also necessary to explain to them that when calculating the original consumption level of urban and rural people, it can only be based on the general purchasing level of a certain class, and not on the purchasing power of a certain individual. Therefore, some excessively high consumption will inevitably be subject to some restrictions, and those that are too low may not even use up the quantity stipulated in the quota. This situation may exist not only in rural areas, but also in cities, which is unavoidable. Restricting excessively high consumption to meet the basic needs of the broad masses of people is an important aspect of the planned supply policy of cotton cloth. In this case, for those with too low consumption who cannot use it up, it is possible to promote mutual adjustment to meet the needs of those in urgent need, which is the current correct approach. Can we reduce some of the supply from the cities to supply more to the rural areas in order to meet the needs of people with excessively high consumption in the rural areas? This cannot solve the problem. Because there are fewer people in cities and more people in the countryside, if the city reduces one chi of cloth per person per year, the average increase per person in the countryside is less than two cun. The fundamental way to increase the supply of cotton cloth to urban and rural people is to build China's heavy industry and develop agriculture and light industry accordingly. Only with the development of socialist industrialization, with the annual growth of cotton production in China, the increasing progress of the cotton textile industry, and the continuous improvement of the purchasing power of urban and rural people, can the urban and rural supply quotas be continuously adjusted according to the needs of the people.

There are also situations where the special needs of individual consumers are not taken care of very well. This is because the planned supply of cotton cloth adopts an average quota within a certain range, and the commercial departments are not yet able to investigate the actual needs of consumers clearly. For example, in some areas, the quota is low, and it is difficult for single people to adjust; cadres transferred from the south to the north have insufficient original quota to add clothing and bedding; the working conditions in forest areas and mining areas are different, and the quota is not well taken care of; the local quota for temporary workers in basic construction is low; demobilized soldiers have returned their original clothing and bedding to the army and need to make clothing and bedding separately; ethnic minorities scattered in various places have different clothing habits and need more cloth; and primary school teachers in individual areas do not have the same quota as workers and cadres. We must care about these individual difficulties of consumers, and we should give necessary care based on the specific conditions in various places, in a pragmatic and economical manner. The supply of special cloth for childbirth, death, marriage, and disasters is a special consideration given by the state starting from the actual needs of the people, and has been included in the total control figures of the planned supply of cotton cloth. However, at present, cadres in some areas one-sidedly emphasize saving cotton cloth, and there is a phenomenon of excessively tight control over the special cloth. Recently, in Baolin Township, Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, 45 pairs of farmers got married, but none of them bought special cloth. An exploration team in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, wanted to buy two chi of red cloth, and after opening three certificates, they could not buy it. In addition, the procedures for the supply of special cloth in some areas are complicated, so that consumers cannot receive cloth tickets in time. This situation should also be changed in time.

Strengthening the transformation of private cotton cloth merchants is an important aspect of continuing to do a good job in the planned supply of cotton cloth. After the implementation of the planned supply of cotton cloth, most of the private wholesalers have ended their business and been properly arranged, and a small part has been converted to retail; private retailers have mainly adopted the distribution method and have been incorporated into the orbit of state capitalism. After these works, most of the private cotton cloth merchants have begun to realize that accepting the transformation has a bright future, and they operate with peace of mind in accordance with the national policy; but a part of the private cotton cloth merchants are afraid that the goods are incomplete, and that the business volume will decline, so their management is passive; a few private cotton cloth merchants also have illegal acts such as evading registration of inventory, withdrawing funds, rushing to buy and buy, raising prices and lowering prices, and using bad goods to fill good goods. According to these situations, in order to do a good job in the planned supply of cotton cloth in the future, the transformation of private cotton cloth merchants must be strengthened. On the one hand, it is necessary to properly allocate sources of goods, improve the method of allocating sources of goods, and ensure a certain business volume for them, so that they can maintain the life of employees and benefit further transformation of private merchants; on the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen their education and leadership, urge them to strive to improve business management, and establish necessary regular supervision and inspection systems to prevent their illegal acts, so that they can better serve the people. At present, the business volume stipulated in some areas is relatively tight, and the methods are relatively mechanical, which must be appropriately changed. More attention must be paid to the transformation of private cotton cloth merchants in rural areas. It is necessary to prevent the phenomenon that the area of ​​transfer is too large. If there is a phenomenon that the area of ​​transfer is too large and the area of ​​arrangement and transformation is too small, it should be corrected. In order to ensure the normal progress of rural commercial activities, and reduce the phenomenon of excessive transfer of private merchants causing an increase in the number of unemployed.

To continue to do a good job in the planned supply of cotton cloth, it is also necessary to prevent the bureaucratic management style of state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial workers. Some state-owned cotton yarn cloth companies and department store cotton cloth supply departments in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, the shop assistants said: "The shop door opens to the south, bring the ticket to buy cloth," thinking that their responsibility has become lighter after the planned supply of cotton cloth, and they can just sell whatever they have, relax the work of organizing the purchase of goods and expanding sales. The cloth group of the Fourth Store of the county department store was originally a model group. Since the planned supply of cotton cloth, the shop assistants of the group have become indifferent to customers. A customer asked four or five times outside the counter, and the shop assistant only answered one sentence. When the customer asked again, the shop assistant impatiently said: "Buy if you have a ticket, what are you asking?" Some individual shop assistants even said: "You don't have to talk about attitude for planned supply." It must be pointed out that it is the necessary quality of commercial workers in New China to treat customers politely, sincerely and happily. For planned supply commodities, especially cotton cloth, it is necessary to actively organize the supply in accordance with the quotas and vouchers stipulated by the state. The matter is very clear: the implementation of the planned supply of cotton cloth should not in the slightest allow the commercial departments to ignore the attention to sales work, ignore the needs of consumers for varieties, colors, specifications, and quality, ignore the active improvement of business management, but should instead double their efforts on the basis of the past to improve the service attitude to consumers, and continuously improve the business level, actively promote cotton cloth, and strive to complete the plan. To meet the needs of the broad masses of people after the planned supply of cotton cloth.

### 继续做好棉布计划供应工作

    继续做好棉布计划供应工作
    棉布计划供应办法实施两个多月以来，已有初步的成就。它有效地保证了城乡人民对棉布的基本需要；改造了棉布的自由市场，使几万户私营棉布商基本上纳入国家资本主义的轨道。
    在棉布计划供应开始实行的时候，有些人曾有过各种顾虑，怕供应的定额不够用、怕买不到好布、怕布价涨、怕不能任意选择品种质量等。经过两个多月事实的教育，这些顾虑已经解除了，极大多数人民对棉布计划供应是满意的。这是因为凭证供应的数量足、布票有效时间长、棉布价格稳定、不限花色品种，充分照顾到了消费者的方便和利益；尤其是对出生、结婚、死亡等特殊用布给予额外照顾的规定，更体现了人民政府关怀人民生活无微不至的精神。
    但是，棉布计划供应是一项极为复杂而艰巨的新的工作，目前的宣传教育既还不深入，供应工作也缺少经验，因而至今还存在一些问题，需要继续予以解决。其中有的是属于群众对计划供应政策还不了解的问题，例如城乡定额为什么差别很大呢？有的是属于工作中的缺点，例如对个别消费者的特殊困难照顾不够；对私营棉布商还没有安排好；以及国营商业职工服务态度不好等等。这些都是需要继续向群众进行解释和在工作中力求改进的。我们绝不能因为棉布计划供应已经取得了一些成绩而松懈麻痹，盲目自满。
    有些在农村工作的同志和部分农民，看到农村定额较低，特别是一些消费量较高的人，供应定额不能满足他们的需要，因而对城乡棉布计划供应定额的差别，就有一些意见，这是需要向他们解释清楚的。首先要向他们说明棉布计划供应的定额，不是政治待遇，而是在城乡人民原有的消费水平上，根据城市少增、农村多增的原则规定的。这个原则既符合逐步提高棉布消费水平的方针，也符合城乡人民实际需要。其次还要向他们说明在计算城乡人民原有的消费水平时，也只能根据某一阶层一般的购买水平，而不是根据某一个人的购买力。因此，某些消费量过高的必然会受到一些限制，过低的又可能还用不完定额规定的数量，这种情况不只在农村中可能存在，就是在城市中也有，这是不可避免的。限制过高的消费，以满足广大人民的基本需要，正是棉布计划供应政策的一个重要的方面。在这种情况下，对消费量过低而用不完的，可以提倡互相调剂，以满足急迫者的需要，这是当前的正确的做法。能不能为了满足农村消费量过高的人的需要，就从城市中减少一些供应量来多供应农村呢？这是不能解决问题的。因为城市人口少、乡村人口多，如果城市每人每年减少一尺布，分到农村，每人平均增加还不到二寸。提高城乡人民棉布供应量的根本办法，是建设我国的重工业，相应发展农业和轻工业。只有随着社会主义工业化的发展，在我国棉花生产逐年增长、棉纺织工业日益进展和城乡人民购买力不断提高的情况下，城乡供应定额，才可以根据人民的需要不断得到调整。
    对个别消费者的特殊需要照顾得不十分周到的情形也是存在的。这是由于棉布计划供应在一定范围内采取了平均的定额，和商业部门目前对消费者的实际需要一时还不易调查清楚的原因。例如某些地区定量较低，单身者调剂困难；南方调到北方工作的干部，原有定量不够添置衣、被；林区、矿区的工作条件不同，定量没有很好照顾；基本建设临时工人本地的定量较低；转业军人原有衣被已交回部队须另制衣被；分散各地的少数民族衣着习惯不同，需布较多；和个别地区小学教职员没有按照工人和干部的定量等。消费者的这种个别困难，我们必须关心，并且应该根据各地具体情况，实事求是，本节约原则，给以必要的照顾。对于生育、死亡、嫁娶、灾害等特殊用布的供应，这是国家从人民的实际需要出发给予的特殊照顾，并已酌量列入棉布计划供应总的控制数字以内。但目前部分地区的干部片面强调节约棉布，对特殊用布有控制过紧的现象，四川省乐至县宝林乡最近有四十五对农民结婚，都没有买得特殊用布。四川省温江县一个勘察队要买二尺红布，开了三次证明，都没有买到。此外，有些地区对特殊用布供应的手续繁复，以至消费者不能及时领到布票。这种情况也要及时加以改变的。
    加强对私营棉布商的改造工作，是继续做好棉布计划供应工作的一个重要方面。棉布实行计划供应以后，私营批发商大部分已结束业务，得到适当安插，小部分转为零售；私营零售商主要采取了经销方式，纳入了国家资本主义轨道。经过这些工作，大部分私营棉布商对接受改造、前途光明这一点开始有了认识，遵照国家的政策，安心经营；但也有一部分私营棉布商则怕货色不全，怕营业额下降，因而经营消极；少数私营棉布商还有逃避登记存货、抽逃资金、抢购套购、抬价降价、以坏货充好货等等违法行为。根据这些情况，今后要做好棉布计划供应工作，对私营棉布商的改造工作，必须加强。一方面要适当分配货源，改进分配货源的方法，保证他们一定的营业额，使他们能够维持职工生活，有利于进一步对私商改造；另一方面，必须加强对他们的教育、领导，督促其努力改善经营管理，并建立必要的经常的监督、检查制度，防止其违法行为，使他们更好地为人民服务。目前某些地区规定的营业额比较紧、办法比较机械，必须适当改变。对农村私营棉布商的改造，更须十分注意。必须防止转业面偏大的现象，如有转业的面偏大，安排、改造的面偏小的现象应予以纠正。以保证农村商业活动的正常进行，并减少私商转业过多造成失业人数增加的现象。
    继续做好棉布计划供应工作，还必须防止国营商业、合作社商业工作人员中的官僚主义经营作风。黑龙江省海伦县有些国营花纱布公司，百货公司棉布供应部门的店员说：“商店门向南开，要买布拿票来”，认为棉布计划供应以后自己的责任轻了，有啥卖啥就行啦，放松了组织进货和扩大推销的工作，县百货公司四商店布匹组原是一个模范小组，自棉布计划供应以后，小组的店员对顾客态度就冷淡起来，有一个顾客在柜台外面问了四、五声，店员才回答一句，顾客再问，店员便不耐烦地说：“有票就买，问啥？”甚至有个别店员说：“计划供应可以不讲什么态度。”必须指出：有礼貌地、诚诚恳恳地、愉快地对待顾客是新中国商业工作人员必具的品质。对于计划供应的商品，特别是棉布，必须按照国家规定的定额和凭证，积极组织供应。事情很明显：棉布实行了计划供应，商业部门丝毫不应该忽视对推销工作的注意，忽视品种、花色、规格、质量对消费者的需要，忽视对经营管理的积极改善，相反的应该在过去的基础上加倍努力，来改善对消费者的服务态度，不断提高业务水平，积极推销棉布，努力完成计划。以适应棉布计划供应之后的广大人民的需要。
