    Second All-Union Writers' Congress
    Soviet Writer Si. Preobrazhensky
    Twenty years have passed since the First All-Union Writers' Congress.
    In these years, the lives of the Soviet people have been filled with many historically significant events. Soviet literature, which truthfully reflects the life of Soviet people, has become a brave propagator of new, truly humanistic ideas, and it has played and continues to play a significant role in the communist education of the Soviet people.
    The First All-Union Writers' Congress was attended by 597 delegates representing the literary workers of fifty-two nationalities of the Soviet Union. Foreign writers such as Nexø, Aragon, Becher, Xiao San, and Brecht also actively participated in the congress.
    The First Congress was held under the banner of affirming the new literary principles of Soviet society. Soviet literature is the most ideological, advanced, and revolutionary literature in the world.
    When speaking to Soviet writers at that congress, Nexø said: "You are the advanced troops, you are the vanguard of humanity. I salute you—the vanguard of humanity. I am very happy with the works you have already created, and I wish you further great achievements."
    The significance of the First All-Union Writers' Congress was enormous. The congress formulated the tasks for Soviet literature in the near future, promoted a new upsurge of all creative forces in the Soviet state, united the literatures of all Soviet nationalities under unified principles, strengthened the ties between Russian writers and writers of all other Soviet national republics, and established the Union of Soviet Writers.
    The historical significance of the First Soviet Writers' Congress also lies in the fact that the congress affirmed that the basic creative method of Soviet literature is the creative method of socialist realism, which guarantees Soviet writers the greatest possible opportunity to unleash their creativity in choosing various forms, styles, and genres of artistic works.
    In the years since the First Congress, Soviet literature has achieved great successes. Soviet literature vividly demonstrates the new, truly free characteristics of the literature of the working people in principle: genuine popular character and close ties with progressive national traditions, truthfulness and loyalty to communist ideas, and true freedom that opens up a vast garden for artists to express their individual originality.
    In these years, literature has become a truly national cause in the Soviet Union. It is enough to point out that in the last twenty-five years, the total number of Soviet literary works published has exceeded two billion copies.
    Many works by Soviet writers published after the First Congress have been widely disseminated in the Soviet Union. These works have also been translated into dozens of foreign languages.
    One of the greatest achievements in the development of Soviet literature in the past twenty years is the tremendous upsurge in the literature of all Soviet nationalities on the basis of the continuous consolidation of friendship among the Soviet nationalities. New national literatures have emerged and are developing successfully. In the multi-ethnic Soviet literature, the ranks of young writers have expanded. The themes of the literatures of various fraternal nationalities have also expanded infinitely. The outstanding literary works of various fraternal nationalities have been recognized by the entire people.
    The first few five-year plans before the war were characterized by the great growth of Russian literature.
    During this period, the great Russian writer—the founder of socialist realism literature, Gorky, tirelessly continued his creative activities. The talents of the outstanding Soviet writers A. Tolstoy and Sholokhov were displayed in the lengthy works "The Road to Calvary" and "And Quiet Flows the Don," which profoundly revealed the complex course of events in the Soviet state.
    During this period, many famous Soviet literary works also appeared: for example, Fadeyev's "The Last of the Udege," Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered," and Makarenko's "The Road to Life."
    During this period, the famous Soviet writers Priboy, Chinsky, and Katayev published brilliant works describing the pre-revolutionary situation in the Soviet state. At the same time, there were also works by Borodin, Solovyov, and U. Yan describing the ancient history of Russia, and new works by Belyantsev, Ivanov and others describing the civil war.
    In the novels of Ehrenburg and Pavlenko, the lives and liberation struggles of the working people in the capitalist world occupied an important place.
    The themes and problems explored by Soviet writers were varied. However, the main theme of Soviet literature in the period before the Great Patriotic War was the inspiring creativity and constructive labor of the Soviet people, as expressed in the works of Gladkov, Malyshev, Panfilov, Tvardovsky, Krymov, and many other writers.
    Russian playwrights Pogodin, Arbuzov, Gusev, and Kron, Ukrainian playwright Korneichuk, and Belarusian playwright Krapiva, among others, achieved significant accomplishments during this period.
    The work of Soviet poets was also remarkably successful.
    The great educational role of Soviet literature in the life of the Soviet people was demonstrated with particular force during the Great Patriotic War. Writers from all national republics appeared in these heroic years as a fighting, highly ideologically conscious army of Soviet patriots and soldiers.
    During the Great Patriotic War, more than a thousand literary workers participated in the struggle to defend the motherland against fascist aggression.
    Of the seven thousand books written during the war, the vast majority were written by authors who had close ties with the activities of the troops.
    In Soviet literature from 1941 to 1945, the image of the people-soldier occupied a central place. Victory in the Great Patriotic War was achieved with their blood and labor.
    The excellent works of the war period (such as Fadeyev's "The Young Guard," Polevoi's "The Story of a Real Man," and Gorbachev's "The Unvanquished," among the best, first-rate works) showed the typical characteristic of the socialist realism method, which is the combination of strict truth of life with the Soviet people's foresight of the victory of the just cause. The heroes of the Young Guard such as Oleg, Zoya, and Matrosov have become beloved heroes who educate Soviet youth to be infinitely loyal to communism. The image of Vasily Tyorkin, created by the poet Tvardovsky, was extremely popular.
    The years after the war were years of further upsurge in Soviet literature.
    Soviet writers reflected many of the most important events in the life of the nation in their works, creating the images of Soviet people returning to the path of peaceful labor in many novels, novellas, poems, and plays.
    Novels written during these years, such as Pavlenko's "Happiness," Azaev's "Far from Moscow," Panova's "Kruzhilikha," Kočetov's "The Zhurbins," Nikolayeva's "Harvest," Babayevsky's "Cavalier of the Gold Star," Lācis' "Storm" and "To the New Shore," and others, have gained widespread fame.
    The theme of the struggle for world peace has also been particularly clearly reflected in Soviet literary works of the post-war period.
    Soviet writers used various literary genres—lyric poems, long poems, novels, plays, satirical sketches, and songs—to promote the ideas of friendship and unity among the people of the world and the struggle against the instigators of new wars.
    As a propagator of this great idea, Soviet literature has creative ties with progressive foreign writers. Writers from people's democratic countries and progressive writers from capitalist countries have seen in Soviet literature an example of genuine popular character. The Norwegian writer Eyvind Bølstad said: "The contribution of Soviet writers to world literature lies in the fact that their lives and creations are inextricably linked with the lives of the working masses. This is so deeply rooted in them that their works are neither artificial nor far-fetched. Their creations are a natural expression of their passion and rich spiritual strength, and their spiritual strength is the secret of talent. ... The spiritual strength of Soviet writers effectively infects readers, calling on them to engage in happy labor for the common good. The writer is aware of the sublime passion that unites him with the entire people, he shares joys and sorrows with the people, and he shares victories with the people."
    The achievements of Soviet literature in the past twenty years are unquestionable. However, despite these achievements, there are still many tasks to be solved in front of Soviet literature. Soviet readers have made reasonable demands on writers, expecting them to create images of Soviet people that are worthy of the era in which they live.
    The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union pointed out the main shortcomings and weaknesses of Soviet literature, and called on writers to create positive characters who are worthy of being examples for Soviet people, to satirize and expose the undesirable phenomena that exist in Soviet real life, and to strive to achieve a high level of artistic skill in their works.
    Undoubtedly, one of the main tasks of the Second All-Union Writers' Congress will be to determine the specific paths to solve the above-mentioned tasks.
    More than 700 delegates and representatives of the broad Soviet society will participate in the Second All-Union Writers' Congress. Many foreign guests will also be invited to attend the congress.
    In addition to the general report on the status and tasks of Soviet literature, the congress will also hear and discuss sub-reports on Soviet prose, poetry, drama, film scripts, children's and youth literature, literary criticism, and translations of literary works from various Soviet nationalities. There will also be a special report on the progressive literature of the modern world.
    In addition, the congress will also discuss and adopt the new constitution of the Union of Soviet Writers, and re-elect the central leading body of the Writers' Union.
    Undoubtedly, the Second All-Union Writers' Congress will be conducted under the banner of the new task facing literature—the communist education of the people.

    第二次全苏作家代表大会
    苏联作家  斯·普列奥布拉仁斯基
    自第一次全苏作家代表大会以来，已经过去二十年了。
    在这些年间，苏联人民的生活中充满了许多有重大历史意义的事件。真实地反映苏维埃人生活的苏联文学，成为新的真正人道主义思想的勇敢的宣扬者，它在对苏联人民进行共产主义教育事业中已经起了，并且还在起着巨大的作用。
    出席第一次全苏作家代表大会的有代表苏联五十二个民族的文学工作者的五百九十七名代表。外国作家如尼克索、阿拉贡、贝希尔、萧三、布洛克等也积极地参加了大会。
    第一次代表大会是在确认苏维埃社会的新的文学原则的标志下举行的。苏维埃文学是世界上最有思想性、最先进和最革命的文学。
    尼克索在那次代表大会上向苏联作家讲话时曾经这样说道：“你们是先进的队伍，你们是人类的先锋队。我向你们——人类的先锋队致敬。你们已经创作出来的作品使我非常高兴，并且祝你们进一步获得伟大的成就。”
    第一次全苏作家代表大会的意义是非常巨大的。代表大会拟订了苏联文学最近期间的任务，促进了苏维埃国家一切创作力量的新高涨，使苏联各民族的文学在一致的原则下团结起来，加强了俄罗斯作家同所有其他苏维埃民族共和国作家的联系，成立了苏联作家协会。
    第一次苏联作家代表大会的历史意义还在于，代表大会肯定了苏联文学的基本创作方法是社会主义现实主义的创作方法，这种创作方法保证苏联作家在选择艺术作品的各种形式、风格和体裁上有发挥创造性的极大可能。
    在第一次代表大会以后的这些年间，苏联文学获得了巨大的成就。苏联文学十分鲜明地表现了劳动人民的文学原则上新的、真正自由的特点：真正的人民性和同进步的民族传统的紧密联系，真实性和忠实于共产主义思想，为艺术家开辟了表现个人独创精神的广阔园地的真正自由。
    在这些年间，文学在苏联成了真正全民的事业。只要指出这一点就够了：最近二十五年内，苏联文学作品的出版总数已经超过了二十亿册。
    在第一次代表大会以后出版的苏联作家的许多著作，在苏联得到了广泛的传播。这些作品还被译成了几十种外国文字。
    苏联文学在过去二十年内发展的最大成就之一，是苏联各民族文学在苏联各民族友谊不断巩固的基础上的巨大高涨。新的民族文学产生了，并且在顺利地发展起来。在多民族的苏联文学中，青年作家的队伍扩大起来了。各兄弟民族文学的主题也无限地扩大了。各兄弟民族的优秀的文学作品得到了全民的承认。
    战前头几个五年计划时期的特征是俄罗斯文学的巨大成长。
    在这个时期，伟大的俄罗斯作家——社会主义现实主义文学的奠基人高尔基不倦地继续着创作活动。杰出的苏联作家阿·托尔斯泰和萧洛霍夫的才能在长篇著作“苦难的历程”和“静静的顿河”中展示出来，这些作品深刻地揭示出苏维埃国家中所发生的事件的复杂历程。
    在这个时期，也出现了许多苏联文学名著：例如法捷耶夫的“来自乌地格的最后一人”、奥斯特洛夫斯基的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、马卡连科的“教育诗”。
    在这个时期，苏联著名作家普里波衣、钦斯基、卡达耶夫发表了描写苏维埃国家革命前情况的光辉著作，同时也出现了鲍罗廷、梭罗维也夫、乌·扬的描写俄罗斯古代历史的著作，别尔文采夫、伊凡诺夫等人描写国内战争的新著作。
    在爱伦堡和巴甫连柯的小说中，资本主义世界劳动人民的生活和解放斗争占据了重要的地位。
    苏联作家所探讨的主题和问题是各式各样的。然而，苏联文学在伟大卫国战争以前时期的主要主题，就是在革拉特珂夫、马雷舍夫、潘菲洛夫、特瓦尔多夫斯基、克雷莫夫和其他许多作家的著作中所表现的主题——苏联人民的鼓舞人心的创造力和建设性的劳动。
    俄罗斯剧作家包哥庭、阿尔布卓夫、古舍夫、克朗，乌克兰剧作家考涅楚克，白俄罗斯剧作家克拉皮娃等人，在这个时期获得了重大的成就。
    苏联诗人的工作也是成绩卓著的。
    苏联文学在苏联人民生活中的伟大教育作用，以特殊的力量在伟大卫国战争时期表现了出来。所有各民族共和国的作家，以一支战斗的、具有高度思想觉悟的苏维埃爱国者—战士的队伍出现在这些英雄的年代里。
    在伟大卫国战争时期，有一千名以上的文学工作者参加了保卫祖国反对法西斯侵略的斗争。
    战争期间创作的七千部书中，绝大多数是由同部队的活动有密切联系的作者写的。
    在一九四一年到一九四五年的苏联文学中，人民—战士的形象占据中心的地位。在伟大卫国战争中，胜利就是用他们的鲜血和劳动取得的。
    战争时期的优秀作品（例如法捷耶夫的“青年近卫军”、波列沃伊的“真正的人”、郭尔巴托夫的“不屈的人们”等都是其中最好的，第一流的作品）显示出社会主义现实主义方法的典型的特征，就是严格的生活真实同苏联人民对正义事业的胜利的预见相结合的特征。奥列格等青年近卫军英雄、卓娅、马特洛索夫已成为令人爱戴的、教育苏联青年无限忠诚于共产主义的英雄。为诗人特瓦尔多夫斯基创造的华西里·焦尔金的形象受到了极大的欢迎。
    战后几年是苏联文学进一步高涨的年份。
    苏联作家以自己的作品反映了国家生活中的许多最重要事件，在许多长篇小说、中篇小说、诗歌和剧本中创造了回到和平劳动道路上来的苏维埃人的形象。
    在这些年间写成的小说，如巴甫连柯的“幸福”、阿札耶夫的“远离莫斯科的地方”、潘诺娃的“克鲁日里哈”、柯契托夫的“茹尔宾一家”、尼古拉耶娃的“收获”、巴巴耶夫斯基的“金星英雄”、拉齐斯的“暴风雨”和“走向新岸”以及其他等等，都获得了广泛的声誉。
    争取世界和平的主题，在战后时期的苏联文学作品里也得到了特别明显的反映。
    苏联作家运用各种文学体裁——抒情诗、长诗、小说、剧本、讽刺小品和歌曲——来宣扬世界各族人民的友谊团结和反对新战争挑拨者的斗争的思想。
    作为这种伟大思想的宣扬者的苏联文学，同外国的进步作家有着创作上的联系。人民民主国家的作家和资本主义国家的进步作家，从苏联文学中看到了真正的人民性的榜样。挪威作家爱温德·鲍尔斯塔特说道：“苏联作家对世界文学的贡献在于，他们的生活和创作是同劳动群众的生活不可分割地联系在一起的。这一点在他们身上是如此地根深蒂固，所以他们的作品就没有造作或是牵强附会了。他们的创作是他们的热情和丰富的精神力量的自然表现，而其精神力量就是才能的秘诀。……苏联作家的精神力量有效地感染着读者，召唤他们为了共同的福利而从事愉快的劳动。作家意识到那种把他和全体人民结合起来的崇高的热情，他和人民共同渡过患难，和人民共同获得胜利。”
    苏联文学在过去二十年来获得的成就是无可置疑的。但是，尽管有这些成就，在苏联文学面前仍然摆着许多有待解决的任务。苏联读者向作家们提出了合理的要求，期待他们创造出和自己所处的时代相称的苏维埃人的形象来。
    苏联共产党第十九次代表大会指出了苏联文学的主要缺点和弱点，并号召作家创造足以成为苏维埃人榜样的正面人物的形象，讽刺并揭露那些存在于苏维埃现实生活中的不良现象，并为达到作品的艺术技巧的高度水平而斗争。
    无疑的，第二次全苏作家代表大会的主要任务之一，将是确定解决上述这些任务的具体道路。
    参加第二次全苏作家代表大会的将有七百多名代表和广大苏联社会人士的代表。许多外国来宾也将应邀参加大会。
    除了关于苏联文学的状况和任务的总报告以外，大会还将听取和讨论关于苏联的散文、诗歌、戏剧、电影剧本，关于儿童文学和少年文学，关于文学批评和翻译苏联各民族文学作品的副报告。关于现代世界进步文学的问题也将有专门的报告。
    除此以外，大会还要讨论和通过苏联作家协会的新的章程，并改选作家协会的中央领导机构。
    无疑的，第二次全苏作家代表大会将在文学所面临的——对人民进行共产主义教育这个新的任务的标志下进行。
