    Telegram of Greetings from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Second All-Union Congress of Writers
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union extends warm congratulations to the Second All-Union Congress of Writers, and through the Congress to all representatives of the great literature of the victorious socialist country.
    The Communist Party highly values the role of Soviet literature in cultivating new people, in consolidating the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society, and in the efforts to build communism.
    In the years since the First All-Union Congress of Writers, Soviet literature has made great progress. Many literary works truthfully reflect the enthusiasm for building socialism, the unparalleled feats of the patriotic Soviet people in the difficult years of the Great Patriotic War, and the labor heroism of our people in the post-war economic recovery. No literature has ever had such a wide audience of readers who embrace it with care and sympathy as our Soviet literature.
    The rapid economic, political, and cultural development of the various Soviet Republics has promoted the development of the literature of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. With the close cooperation of writers from various fraternal republics, national literatures have developed and enriched each other. In the Soviet Union, a multinational literature with great historical significance has been created, embodying the progressive ideas of our time.
    During these years, the international prestige of Soviet literature has increased, and the number of readers outside the Soviet Union, especially in the people's democracies, has increased immeasurably. Soviet literature is praised among millions of foreign readers because it always stands up to defend the interests of the working people, uses the ideas of humanism, and the struggle for peace and friendship among all nations to counter the misanthropic ideology of imperialism, and is full of optimistic confidence in the bright future of mankind.
    In the creative activities of Soviet writers, what inspires them is the great idea of fighting for communism, for the real freedom and happiness of the masses, and against all forms of oppression and exploitation of man by man. Our writers proudly use their noble ideas and positions of serving the interests of the working people and the interests of the country to counter the hypocritical slogans of the bourgeois deception of so-called literary "independence" from society, and to counter the deceptive concept of "art for art's sake."
    The Second All-Union Congress of Writers has the responsibility to discuss the most important issues in creative work and to formulate ways to further elevate our literature to new heights.
    Our country and all the Soviet people are currently facing glorious tasks. On the basis of the achievements of socialist industry and agriculture, important measures are being implemented to further comprehensively develop the socialist economy and culture, which is extremely important for consolidating socialist society and gradually transitioning from socialism to communism.
    The aggressive and reactionary forces of capitalism are constantly trying to forcibly prevent the growth of socialist forces and the growing desire of all nations to break free from the shackles of capitalism and colonial oppression. The competition between socialism and capitalism is unfolding on an increasingly large scale internationally and is entering a new and higher stage. In this context, the transformative and actively educational role of Soviet literature is increasing infinitely.
    Literature, like all other art forms, must inspire the Soviet people to engage in creative labor, overcome all difficulties and shortcomings on this path, and inspire them to carry out the great cause of building communism.
    The Soviet people hope that their writers will create truthful and vivid images of the people of our glorious era. Our contemporaries are realizing the great task of continuously developing our heavy industry—the foundation for the further development of the entire national economy and the unbreakable guarantee of our borders—building huge power stations, continuously perfecting construction methods, and reclaiming millions of hectares of virgin land, fighting for the high tide of our entire agriculture and to better meet the growing needs of the working people in food and consumer goods.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union calls on writers, on the basis of creatively mastering Marxism-Leninism, to delve deeply into reality. Marxism-Leninism teaches us how to observe the extremely complex and diverse reality of life that arises in the current international situation of the struggle between the imperialist camp and the socialist democratic camp, how to understand the process of development under the leadership of the Communist Party in our country, how to understand the laws and prospects of our social development, and to reveal the contradictions and conflicts in life.
    The Soviet people hope to see their writers as passionate warriors who actively delve into life, help the people build a new society, a society with an inexhaustible source of social wealth; constantly producing new people—whose minds will be free from the ideological remnants of capitalism. It is the responsibility of our writers to educate the Soviet people with communist ideas and communist morality, to promote the comprehensive and harmonious development of personality, and to promote the full development of all creative talents and abilities of the working people. It is the responsibility of Soviet writers to create true art—an art with great ideas and feelings, which profoundly reveals the rich spiritual world of the Soviet people, and embodies the labor of the Soviet people in many ways through the typicality of characters, as well as the social and personal life in an indivisible unity. The responsibility of our literature is not only to reflect the newly born, but also to strive to help the newly born achieve victory.
    The important and glorious task of literature is to educate young people, young workers, collective farm members, intellectuals, and Soviet military personnel with a spirit of love for labor, courage, fearlessness, confidence in the victory of our cause, and infinite loyalty to the socialist motherland, ready at any time to give a devastating blow to the imperialist aggressors who come to disrupt the peaceful labor of our people.
    When imperialist aggressive groups regroup and revive the defeated forces of German fascism, Soviet literature cannot stand aloof from the struggle against the reactionary forces of the old world. Now Soviet literature is required to educate and strengthen the patriotic feelings of the Soviet people with full revolutionary energy, strengthen the friendship of all nationalities in our country, promote the further unity of the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, and educate the working people with the spirit of proletarian internationalism and fraternal unity.
    The responsibility of writers is to hold high the banner of uniting all peace-loving forces to fight for the security of all nations, to expose and denounce the evil plans of the imperialists to provoke a new world war.
    Soviet writers, inheriting the excellent traditions of Russian classical literature and world classical literature, creatively develop the method of socialist realism laid down by the great proletarian writer Gorky, and follow the tradition of Mayakovsky's battle poetry. Socialist realism requires literary workers to truthfully and historically specifically reflect the revolutionary development of real life. To meet the standards of the task of socialist realism means to thoroughly understand the real life of people, to understand their thoughts and feelings, to be closely related to their feelings, and to be good at expressing them in moving artistic forms worthy of truly exemplary realistic literature, so that everyone can naturally understand the great struggle of the working class and all the Soviet people to further consolidate our socialist society that has been built and to strive for the victory of communism. Under the current conditions, the method of socialist realism requires writers to understand the task of completing socialist construction in our country and gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. Socialist realism makes it possible to give play to a wide range of creative initiative, and to choose various creative forms and styles according to the writer's own preferences and interests. The lack of the principles of socialist realism will cause losses to the development of Soviet literature.
    Our literature is still far behind the vigorously developing life, and behind the demands of readers who have been improved politically and culturally. Some writers have not made due demands on their work, and have allowed themselves to write mediocre and weak works lacking Soviet reality. In recent times, few vivid artistic images have been created that can serve as inspiring examples for millions of readers. A magnificent masterpiece describing the heroic deeds of the Russian proletariat and Lenin's party during the First Russian Revolution and the Great October Socialist Revolution has not yet been written. There are still few works describing our Soviet army, which faithfully protects the peaceful labor of the Soviet people. Literary criticism and literary theory still have serious shortcomings, and what is required in this regard is to tap the extremely rich heritage of classical writers and summarize the experience of Soviet literature, and promote the improvement of our literature in terms of ideological and artistic quality.
    In some works, there is a tendency to beautify our reality and remain silent about the contradictions in the development process and the difficulties in the growth process, which has had an adverse impact on the development of our literature. The capitalist remnants existing in people's minds have not been fully reflected in our literature. On the other hand, some writers have become detached from life, looking for far-fetched conflicts, and the vulgar works they write distort and often slander Soviet society, and groundlessly slander Soviet people.
    Soviet writers must actively support all new and progressive things that advance our society, and must use all their energy and enthusiasm to severely criticize the remnants of the old propertied world in people's minds, severely criticize those who are indifferent and lazy, and help eradicate all anti-social and decadent things in our lives that hinder the rapid development of the socialist economy and culture.
    The Party calls on writers to make bold creative efforts, enrich and further develop various forms and genres of literature, and improve the level of their artistic skills in order to fully meet the growing spiritual needs of Soviet readers.
    Soviet writers have the most favorable conditions for engaging in creation. They have millions of readers—friends that writers of the past could not have dreamed of, strict, conscious, and mature readers who love their literature.
    Soviet literature is not only an inspiring example for foreign writers and a source of experience for the struggle for new, advanced, and progressive art, but also, in the process of development and striving for perfection, it uses the best achievements of foreign progressive writers to enrich itself. Our writers, in the struggle for higher artistic levels, can and must continue to make greater use of the valuable experience of our foreign friends.
    The activities of the Soviet Writers' Association are of great importance to solving the glorious and important responsibilities facing Soviet literature. Over the past two decades, this association has grown into a powerful mass organization built on the principle of collective leadership, uniting all the creative forces of Party members and non-Party writers.
    Soviet literature and Soviet writers have grown up ideologically and have been tempered in the struggle against various foreign influences, against the manifestations of bourgeois ideology, and against capitalist remnants. The Soviet Writers' Association must, as it has done in the past, focus all its attention on the ideological nature of Soviet literature, the ideological education of writers, and the improvement of artistic skills. It must resolutely fight against the tendency to deviate from the principles of socialist realism, against attempts to make our literature depart from the life of the Soviet people, from the policies pursued by the Communist Party and the Soviet government, against the revival of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and other manifestations of bourgeois ideology, and against attempts to push our literature into the quagmire of philistinism, ideological emptiness, and decadence.
    Soviet literature, as the most progressive literature in the world, has the responsibility to serve the cause of the working people and to reach the highest peak of world art creation.
    The Writers' Association should always ensure that writers live with the people, understand their interests and wishes, actively participate in building a communist society, and understand our contemporary figures, the true heroes—the builders of communism.
    One of the main tasks of the Soviet Writers' Association is to constantly help young writers develop their creative talents and to enrich Soviet literature with the intelligence of young people.
    The guarantee of new victories for Soviet literature is the further ideological unity of all active forces among writers, the resolute development of principled criticism and self-criticism among writers, and the comradely discussion of creative issues.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union wishes the Second All-Union Congress of Writers success, and expresses its firm belief that our writers will contribute all their energy to serve the Soviet people selflessly and create works worthy of the great era of communist construction.
  Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Signed)

### 苏联共产党中央委员会  致第二次全苏作家代表大会贺电

    苏联共产党中央委员会
    致第二次全苏作家代表大会贺电
    苏联共产党中央委员会向第二次全苏作家代表大会，并通过大会向胜利的社会主义国度的伟大文学的全体代表，表示热烈的祝贺。
    共产党极其珍视苏联文学在培养新人，在巩固苏维埃社会精神上和政治上的团结，在建设共产主义的努力中所起的作用。
    在第一次全苏作家代表大会以来的年月中，苏联文学有了很大的发展。有不少的文学作品真实地反映了建设社会主义的热情，反映了苏联爱国人民在伟大的卫国战争的艰难年月中的无可比拟的功勋，以及我们人民在战后经济恢复中的劳动英雄主义。从来没有任何文学，像我们的苏联文学一样，有着这样广大的抱着爱护和同情的态度的读者。
    各个苏维埃共和国在经济上、政治上和文化上迅速的发展促成了苏联各族人民文学的发展。在各兄弟共和国作家的密切合作下，民族文学已经发展起来并且互相丰富着。在苏联，已经创立了一种具有伟大历史意义，并且体现了我们当代的进步思想的多民族文学。
    在这些年月里，苏联文学的国际威望提高了，苏联国外的读者，尤其是在各人民民主国家的读者的数目有了无可衡量的增加。苏联文学在千百万外国读者中间得到了赞扬，因为它总是挺身起来保卫劳动人民的利益，用人道主义的思想，用争取和平和各国人民友好的斗争来对抗憎恨人类的帝国主义思想，而且对人类的光辉前途充满乐观的信心。
    在苏维埃作家的创作活动中，鼓舞他们的是为共产主义、为广大群众的真正自由和幸福而斗争，为反对各种人对人的压迫和剥削而斗争的伟大思想。我们的作家自豪地用他们的为劳动人民的利益、为国家的利益服务的崇高思想和立场，来对抗资产阶级骗人的所谓文学“独立”于社会之外的伪善的口号，来对抗“为艺术而艺术”的骗人概念。
    第二次全苏作家代表大会有责任讨论创作工作中的各种最重要的问题，并制订出把我们的文学进一步提高到新的高度的办法。
    我们的国家和全体苏联人民目前正面临着光辉的任务。在社会主义工业和农业获得成就的基础上，正在实现各种重要措施，以便进一步全面发展社会主义经济和文化，这对于巩固社会主义社会和逐步从社会主义过渡到共产主义是极其重要的。
    资本主义的侵略成性的反动势力，无时无刻不在想以强力阻止社会主义力量的壮大和各国人民摆脱资本主义桎梏和殖民压迫的愿望的增长。社会主义和资本主义之间的竞争，正在国际范围内日益扩大的规模上展开，而且正在进入新的、更高的阶段。在这种情况下，苏联文学的改造社会和积极教育的作用正在无限地增加。
    文学和其他一切的艺术形式一样，必须鼓舞苏联人民从事创造性的劳动，克服这一道路上的一切困难和缺点，并鼓舞他们进行建设共产主义的伟大事业。
    苏联人民希望他们的作家创造我们光荣的当代人物的真实的和生动的形象。我们的当代人物正在实现不断发展我们的重工业——进一步发展整个国民经济的基础和我们的边疆牢不可破的保证——的巨大任务，正在建筑巨大的电力站，正在使建筑方法不断完善，正在开垦千百万公顷的处女地，为争取我们整个农业的高涨和更好地满足劳动人民在食品和消费品方面日益增长的需要而斗争。
    苏联共产党中央委员会号召作家们，在创造性地掌握马克思—列宁主义的基础上，深入研究现实。马克思—列宁主义教导我们怎样观察在帝国主义阵营和社会主义民主阵营展开斗争的当前国际局势下所产生的极其复杂而多样化的生活的真实情况，怎样了解正在我们国家发生的、在共产党领导下的发展的过程，怎样了解我们社会发展的规律和前景并揭示生活的矛盾和冲突。
    苏联人民希望看到自己的作家是积极深入生活、帮助人民建设新社会的满腔热情的战士，在这个社会里，有着产生社会财富的取之不尽的源泉；不断产生着新的人物——他们的心理将摆脱资本主义的思想残余。我们的作家的责任是以共产主义思想和共产主义道德教育苏联人，促进个性的全面和协调的发展，促进劳动人民的一切创造才能和能力的充分发展。苏联作家的责任是创立真实的艺术——一种具有伟大的思想和感情、深刻地揭示苏联人的丰富的精神世界的艺术，以人物的典型来多方面地体现苏联人的劳动以及处于不可分裂的统一体中的社会和个人生活。我们的文学的责任不仅是反映新生的东西，而且要尽力帮助新生的东西取得胜利。
    文学的重要而光荣的任务是以热爱劳动、勇敢、无畏、对我们事业胜利的信心的精神，以对社会主义祖国无限忠诚、随时准备给予要来破坏我国人民的和平劳动的帝国主义侵略者以毁灭性的打击的精神，来教育青年，教育青年工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子和苏军军人。
    当帝国主义侵略集团重新聚集和复活被击溃的德国法西斯力量的时候，苏联文学不能置身于反对旧世界的反动势力的斗争之外。现在要求苏联文学以全副革命性的精力来教育和加强苏联人的爱国主义感情，加强我国各族人民的友谊，促使强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营进一步的团结起来，教育劳动人民具有无产阶级国际主义精神和兄弟团结的精神。
    作家的责任就是要高举起团结一切爱好和平的力量为各国人民的安全而奋斗的旗帜，揭露和痛斥帝国主义者要挑起新的世界大战的罪恶计划。
    继承了俄罗斯古典文学和世界古典文学的优良传统的苏联作家，创造性地发展着伟大的无产阶级作家高尔基所奠定的社会主义现实主义的方法，追随着马雅柯夫斯基的战斗诗的传统。社会主义现实主义要求文学工作者真实地、按照历史观点具体地来反映现实生活的革命性的发展。要达到社会主义现实主义的任务的标准，这就是说要透彻地了解人们的真正生活，了解他们的思想和感情，对他们的感受息息相关，并且要善于用配得上真正典范的现实主义文学的动人的艺术形式来表现，由此而使大家自然而然地领会工人阶级和全体苏联人民争取进一步巩固我国现在已建成的社会主义社会和争取共产主义胜利的伟大斗争。在目前的条件下，社会主义现实主义的方法要求作家了解到在我国完成社会主义建设和由社会主义逐步向共产主义过渡的任务。社会主义现实主义使得有可能发挥广泛的创造性的主动精神，有可能按照作家自己的爱好和志趣来选择各种各样的创作形式和风格。缺少社会主义现实主义的原则，就会给苏联文学的发展造成损失。
    我们的文学还大大落后于蓬勃发展着的生活、落后于在政治上和文化上已经提高了的读者的要求。某些作家没有对自己的工作作出应有的要求，听任写出缺乏苏维埃现实性的平凡无力的作品。最近期间很少创造出可以作为千百万读者的鼓舞性的榜样的生动的艺术形象。还没有写出一部描写俄国无产阶级和列宁的党在第一次俄国革命和伟大的十月社会主义革命时期的英雄事迹的辉煌巨著。描写忠实地保卫着苏联人的和平劳动的我们苏联军队的作品还很少。文学批评和文艺理论还存在严重的落后现象，要求在这方面做到的是发掘古典作家的极丰富的遗产和总结苏联文学的经验，促进我们文学在思想性和艺术性上的提高。
    在一些作品中，有一种美化我们的现实而对发展过程中的矛盾和生长过程中的困难默不作声的倾向，这种倾向给了我们文学的发展以不良的影响。人们头脑中存在的资本主义残余没有在我们的文学中得到充分的反映。另一方面，某些作家脱离了生活，寻找牵强附会的冲突，他们所写出来的庸俗的作品，歪曲了、往往是诽谤了苏维埃社会，毫无根据地污蔑苏维埃人。
    苏联作家必须积极支持一切使我们的社会前进的新的、进步的东西，必须以全副精力和热诚来严厉批评人们思想中的旧的有产世界的残余，严厉批评那些漠不关心和怠惰的人，帮助根除我们生活中一切阻碍社会主义经济和文化迅速发展的反社会的和腐朽的东西。
    党号召作家们进行大胆的创作努力，丰富和进一步发展文学的各种形式和体裁，提高他们的艺术技巧的水平，以充分满足苏联读者的日益增长的精神需要。
    苏联作家有着从事创作的最有利的条件。他们有着千百万的读者——过去的作家们梦想不到的朋友们，严格的、自觉而成熟的热爱他们的文学的读者。
    苏联文学一方面是外国作家们的令人鼓舞的榜样，以及为新的先进和进步的艺术而斗争的经验的泉源，同时，它又在发展和力求完美的过程中，利用外国进步作家的最优秀的成就来丰富自己。我们的作家在争取更高的艺术水平的斗争中，能够而且必须继续在更大的程度上利用我们外国朋友的宝贵经验。
    苏联作家协会的活动，对解决苏联文学所面临的光荣的责任重大的问题，有着极大的重要性。这个协会在过去二十年中已成长为一个建立在集体领导原则基础上的、团结了党员和非党员作家的一切创作力量的强大群众团体。
    苏联文学和苏联作家已经在思想上成长起来，已经在同各种外来影响、同资产阶级思想的表现和资本主义残余的斗争中受到锻炼。苏联作家协会在今后必须像以往所做的那样，把全部注意力集中在苏联文学的思想性、作家的思想教育和艺术技巧的提高上，它必须坚决地同脱离社会主义现实主义原则的倾向，同想使我们的文学离开苏联人民的生活、离开共产党和苏联政府所奉行的政策的各种迫切问题的企图进行斗争，同民族主义、世界主义和资产阶级思想的其他表现的复活进行斗争，同想把我们的文学推入市侩主义、思想空虚和颓废的泥沼中去的企图进行斗争。
    苏联文学作为全世界最进步的文学，有责任为劳动人民的事业服务，而且达到世界艺术创作的最高峰。
    作家协会应当经常保证作家们同人民在一起生活，了解他们的兴趣和愿望，积极参加建设共产主义社会，了解我们的当代人物，真正的英雄——共产主义的建设者。
    苏联作家协会的主要任务之一是经常帮助青年作家发展创作才能，并且以青年的才智来丰富苏联文学。
    苏联文学新的胜利的保证，是作家中一切积极力量在思想上进一步团结起来，在作家中坚决开展原则性的批评和自我批评，和对创作问题进行同志般的讨论。
    苏联共产党中央委员会预祝第二次全苏作家代表大会成功，并且表示坚决相信，我们的作家将贡献他们的全部精力来为苏联人民忘我地服务，并创作出无愧于共产主义建设的伟大时代的作品。
  苏联共产党中央委员会（签字）
