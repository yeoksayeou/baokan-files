Prime Minister U Nu of the Union of Burma, his wife, and seven members of his entourage visited the Great Wall, a great ancient Chinese architectural wonder, on the morning of the 10th. Accompanying them were Yao Zhongming, our country's ambassador to Burma, Wang Zhuoru, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Wang Yeqiu, Deputy Director of the Social Culture Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Culture.

At 9:30 AM, Prime Minister U Nu and his wife arrived at Badaling by car along a road with melting snow. They ascended the Great Wall there. The mountains inside and outside the Great Wall were covered with white snow, and the cold wind was sharp and biting. Prime Minister U Nu climbed to a high point and looked out over the Great Wall in the severe cold of minus twelve degrees Celsius, taking photographs as souvenirs. On the way back, Prime Minister U Nu visited the Yuntai, a Yuan Dynasty building, and admired the Buddhist statues carved in stone and the Buddhist scriptures engraved in seven languages, including Hindi and Mongolian.

    【新华社十日讯】缅甸联邦总理吴努和他的夫人及随行人员七人在十日上午游览了中国古代的伟大建筑——长城。陪同游览的有我国驻缅甸大使姚仲明、外交部交际处处长王倬如和文化部社会文化事业管理局副局长王冶秋。
    上午九时三十分，吴努总理和他的夫人乘汽车沿残雪未融的公路到达八达岭，在那里登临了万里长城。长城内外的山岭覆盖着皑皑白雪，寒风尖厉刺人。吴努总理在摄氏零下十二度的严寒中登高眺望长城内外，并摄影留念。在归途中，吴努总理参观了元代的建筑云台，瞻仰了云台石雕的佛像和用印地文、蒙文等七种文字镌刻的佛经。
