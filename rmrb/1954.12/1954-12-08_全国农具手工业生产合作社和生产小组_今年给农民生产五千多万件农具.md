Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: According to statistics from the National Handicraft Production Cooperation Exhibition currently being held in Beijing: more than three thousand iron and wood agricultural implement handicraft production cooperatives and handicraft supply and marketing production groups scattered in towns and cities across the country have produced more than 2,000 types, totaling more than 58 million large and small agricultural implements for farmers in various regions this year. These agricultural implements have timely supported agricultural production. This spring, farmers in various parts of Anhui Province expanded cultivated land area by reclaiming wasteland, and iron and wood agricultural implement production cooperatives, production groups, and some individual handicraftsmen throughout the province rushed to produce a large number of wasteland reclamation tools. In Anqing Prefecture alone, more than 360,000 pieces of weeding hoes, nail rakes, and other wood and bamboo agricultural implements were produced. During the tense flood season in the Huai River basin this summer, wood industry production cooperatives and production groups in Anqing and Wuhu Prefectures rushed to produce more than 10,000 waterwheels to help farmers drain water and replant crops. The agricultural implements produced by agricultural implement production cooperatives and production groups in various regions are generally of better quality and lower price than those produced by individual handicraftsmen. According to calculations by five agricultural implement production cooperatives in Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province: the agricultural implements they supply to farmers throughout the year can save farmers at least nearly 100 million yuan.

With the needs of the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, agricultural implement production cooperatives in Heilongjiang, Anhui, Henan, Shandong and other provinces have begun to produce new-style agricultural implements such as horse-drawn seeders, hand-held seeders, ox-drawn double-hole waterwheels, rice threshers, and corn threshers. A small number of agricultural implement production cooperatives have developed from simple small kilns to mechanized or semi-mechanized cooperative factories. In towns and cities with relatively concentrated handicrafts, such as Weifang City in Shandong Province and Yangquan City in Shanxi Province, 80% to 90% of iron and wood handicraftsmen have been organized. There, some small and narrow kiln workshops and woodworking workshops have been replaced by relatively neat and spacious new factory buildings. In these areas where agricultural implement production cooperatives are concentrated, convoys of vehicles fully loaded with agricultural implements are often transported to the countryside.

    全国农具手工业生产合作社和生产小组
    今年给农民生产五千多万件农具
    【新华社七日讯】据正在北京举行的全国手工业生产合作展览会统计：散布在全国各城镇的三千多个铁木农具手工业生产合作社和手工业供销生产小组，今年为各地农民生产了二千多种共五千八百多万件大、小农具。这些农具都及时支援了农业生产。今年春天，安徽省各地农民开荒扩大耕地面积，全省铁木农具生产合作社、生产小组和部分个体手工业者赶制了大批开荒工具。仅安庆专区即生产条锄、钉钯及其它木、竹农具三十六万多件。夏季淮河流域防汛紧张时，安庆、芜湖专区木业生产合作社、生产小组又赶制了一万多部水车帮助农民排水抢种。各地农具生产合作社和生产小组生产的农具一般都比个体手工业者的质量好，价格便宜。据江苏省盐城县五个农具生产合作社计算：他们全年供应给农民的农具，最少可以使农民节省近一亿元。
    随着农村互助合作运动发展的需要，黑龙江、安徽、河南、山东等省的农具生产合作社已开始生产马拉播种机、手提播种机、牛拉双洞水车、打稻机、玉米脱粒机等新式农具。少数农具生产合作社已由过去简陋的小烘炉生产，发展成为机械或半机械化的合作工厂。手工业比较集中的山东潍坊市、山西阳泉市等城镇百分之八十到九十的铁木手工业者都已组织起来。那里，有些过去一片片又矮又狭的小烘炉房、木工房，已为比较整齐宽大的新厂房代替了。在这些农具生产合作社集中的地区，经常有成队的车辆满载农具运往四乡。
