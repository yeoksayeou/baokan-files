Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 13th: According to TASS, the European conference against the arming of West Germany, which opened in Paris on the 11th, continued its session on the 12th. Elected as chairmen of the presidium of the conference were: Édouard Daladier, Radical Socialist Party member of the French National Assembly and former Prime Minister; Paul Bastid, former minister; Doménach, editor-in-chief of the Catholic magazine "Esprit"; Michel Bruguière, member of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the International Conference for a Peaceful Solution to the German Question; Heinrich Grüber, representative of the Protestant Church of the German Democratic Republic; Hans Iwand, Dean of the Theological Faculty of Bonn University; Mrs. Ester Brink, Chairwoman of the Women's Committee of the Danish Radical Party; Professor Felix Iversen of Finland; Bedford, Secretary of the Political Committee of the British Cooperative Union; Riccardo Lombardi, member of the Italian Socialist Party in Parliament; Friihlis, former member of the Norwegian Parliament and social democrat; and René Boair, Swiss writer.

In his opening speech on the 11th, Édouard Daladier called on all forces to unite and fight against the arming of Germany. He emphasized: We respect all people; erroneous policies can bring misfortune and destruction to all people, and may even push people into a third world war; this danger and possibility cannot be ignored.

Referring to the Soviet Union's proposals for a peaceful solution to the German question, Daladier pointed out that the Soviet Union's repeated notes had put forward very concrete proposals on the issue of free elections, which would allow Germany to regain its unity and allow a democratic and peace-loving Germany to occupy its place in the world.

Daladier said that these notes naturally also contained proposals that had already been studied. I want to say: either these proposals are sincere, as I believe, or they are not. So, how do we determine which idea is right? Is it through negotiations or through ratification of the Paris Agreements? He pointed out that ratification of the Paris Agreements would make negotiations on the German question impossible.

Pastor Herbert Mochalski from West Germany said in his speech on the 11th that ratification of the Paris Agreements would mean "the final rejection of unifying my homeland in a peaceful way."

British Labour Party MP Silverman, in his speech, expressed the hope that the French Parliament would refuse to ratify the Paris Agreements, which are "neither necessary nor inevitable."

Also speaking at the plenary session on the 11th were prominent figures such as Léo Hamon, Debu-Bridel, and Bernard Lavergné from France, Alberto Cianca from the Italian Socialist Party, and Steiner, chairman of the Austrian Resistance Fighters League. They all emphasized the danger of ratifying the Paris Agreements to the cause of peace, because these agreements lead to the revival of German militarism.

    在巴黎举行的反对武装西德的欧洲会议继续开会
    许多国家的代表发言反对批准巴黎协定
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十二日讯：十一日在巴黎开幕的反对武装西德的欧洲会议十二日继续开会。当选为会议主席团主席的有：法国的国民议会激进社会党议员、前总理达拉第，前部长保罗·巴斯迪，天主教杂志“灵报”总编辑多门纳克和争取和平解决德国问题国际会议筹备委员会常务委员会委员密歇尔·布吕吉埃，德意志民主共和国新教教会代表亨利·格鲁伯、波恩大学神学院院长汉斯·伊万德，丹麦激进党妇女委员会主席埃斯特·布林克夫人，芬兰的费立克斯·伊维尔逊教授，英国合作社联盟政治委员会书记贝德福，意大利社会党国会议员理卡多·龙巴迪，挪威前议员、社会民主党人弗里利斯和瑞士作家雷尼·布阿尔。
    爱德华·达拉第在十一日发表的开幕词中，号召一切力量团结起来，为反对武装德国而斗争。他强调指出：我们尊重全体人民，错误的政策可能给全体人民带来不幸和毁灭，可能还会把人民推到第三次世界大战之中，这种危险和可能性是不能忽视的。
    达拉第在谈到苏联关于和平解决德国问题的建议时指出，苏联历次的照会对于举行自由选举的问题提出了十分具体的建议，这些建议将使得德国重新恢复统一，使得民主和爱好和平的德国在世界上占有它的地位。
    达拉第说，在这些照会中，自然也有已经研究过的建议。我要说：或者这些建议如我所相信的那样是真诚的，或者它们不是这样。那么，怎样来断定那一种想法对呢？是借助谈判呢，还是借助批准巴黎协定？他指出，批准巴黎协定将使得德国问题的谈判成为不可能。
    来自西德的赫伯特·莫赫斯基牧师在十一日的发言中说：批准巴黎协定将意味着“最后拒绝用和平的方式统一我的祖国”。
    英国工党议员锡尔弗曼在发言中希望法国议会拒绝批准“既不是必要的、也不是不可避免”的巴黎协定。
    在十一日大会上讲话的还有法国的利奥·阿蒙、德布—布里德尔和伯纳·拉维尔湼，意大利的社会党议员艾伯托·昌以及奥地利的抵抗战士联盟主席史坦纳等著名人士。他们都着重指出了批准巴黎协定对和平事业的危险性，因为这些协定导致德国军国主义的复活。
