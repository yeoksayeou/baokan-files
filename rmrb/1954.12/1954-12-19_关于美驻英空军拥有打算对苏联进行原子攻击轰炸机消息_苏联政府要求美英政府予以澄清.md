Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: TASS reported from Moscow on December 17th:

    The Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to the United States, A.F. Dobrynin, visited U.S. Acting Secretary of State Mr. Hoover on December 16th and presented the following statement:

    "According to British newspaper reports, General Stevenson, commander of the U.S. 49th Air Division stationed in Britain, stated on December 10th at the Bentwaters Air Station (UK) that the air division under his command possesses bombers intended for atomic attacks on the Soviet Union, and that this mission was assigned to the air division as early as two and a half years ago.

    In view of the incompatibility of this statement by an official representative of the U.S. armed forces with the existing normal relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, the Soviet government hopes that the U.S. government will clarify whether the newspaper reports concerning General Stevenson's statement are true; and if so, how the U.S. government assesses this statement."

    On December 17th, the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires ad interim to the United Kingdom, N.D. Belokhvostikov, visited the Permanent Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Mr. O. Kirkpatrick, and presented the following statement:

    "According to British newspaper reports, General Stevenson, commander of the U.S. 49th Air Division based in Britain, stated on December 10th at the Bentwaters Air Station (UK) that the air division under his command possesses bombers intended for atomic attacks on the Soviet Union, and that this mission was assigned to the air division as early as two and a half years ago.

    It can be seen from this statement that the United States has already established air bases on British territory, and that these air bases are stationed with aircraft intended for atomic attacks on the Soviet Union. In view of the incompatibility of this fact with the normal relations between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, and its violation of the 1942 Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance in the War Against Hitlerite Germany and her Associates in Europe and Providing for Collaboration and Mutual Assistance Thereafter, the Soviet government hopes that the British government will clarify whether the newspaper reports concerning General Stevenson's statement are true; and if so, how the British government assesses this statement."

    关于美驻英空军拥有打算对苏联进行原子攻击轰炸机消息
    苏联政府要求美英政府予以澄清
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：苏联驻美国临时代办阿·弗·多布里宁十二月十六日往见美国代理国务卿胡佛先生，并提出声明如下：
    “根据英国报纸消息，驻扎在英国的美国第四十九空军师司令史蒂文森将军今年十二月十日在本华特斯航空站（英国）说，他所统辖的空军师拥有打算用来对苏联进行原子攻击的轰炸机，并且说，这一任务是早在两年半以前就交给这个空军师的。
    鉴于美国武装部队官方代表的这一谈话同苏联和美国之间的现存正常关系不能相容，苏联政府希望美国政府澄清报纸所刊载的有关史蒂文森将军的谈话的性质是否属实；如果属实，美国政府对这一谈话作何估价。”
    十二月十七日，苏联驻英国临时代办尼·德·别洛赫沃斯齐科夫往见英国外交部常务次官奥·柯克帕特里克先生，并提出声明如下：
    “根据英国报纸消息，以英国为基地的美国第四十九空军师司令美国的史蒂文森将军今年十二月十日在本华特斯航空站（英国）说，他所统辖的空军师拥有打算用来对苏联进行原子攻击的轰炸机，并且说，这一任务是早在两年半以前就交给这个空军师的。
    由这一谈话可以知道，美国已经在英国领土上建立了空军基地，而在这些空军基地上驻有打算用来对苏联进行原子攻击的飞机。鉴于这一事实同苏联和英国之间的正常关系不能相容，它违反一九四二年的英苏战后合作互助条约，苏联政府希望英国政府澄清报载有关史蒂文森将军的谈话的性质是否属实；如果属实，英国政府对这一谈话作何估价。”
