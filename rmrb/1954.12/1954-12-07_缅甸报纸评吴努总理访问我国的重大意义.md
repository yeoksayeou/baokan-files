Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 6th: The "Burma Star" published an editorial on November 29th stating that Burmese Prime Minister U Nu's visit to the People's Republic of China will be an important milestone in the history of Sino-Burmese relations. The editorial said that the visits of the Prime Ministers of India and Burma to New China were both conducive to peace in Asia. The editorial said: "One blow on the anvil of peace is more valuable than a million hammer blows to prepare for another world war."

The editorial wrote that the time has come for the Burmese Prime Minister to seek important and intimate contact and understanding with the leaders of New China. We believe that such goodwill is absolutely necessary and will become a solid foundation for international relations. Friendship arising from common aspirations is the best guarantee for the realization of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in the Joint Statement of the Prime Ministers of China, India, and Burma.

The Mandalay "People's Daily" published an editorial on the same day entitled "Long Live Sino-Burmese Friendship," stating that Prime Minister U Nu's visit "is a friendly visit to promote greater mutual understanding and unity between the governments and peoples of China and Burma, and it also means that peace-loving people in the Asian region are embarking on a path of greater unity and cooperation."

The editorial pointed out that the people of China and Burma have historically had good friendly relations. The editorial said that the primary task of the people of China and Burma is to find effective ways to get rid of the threat of aggression from foreign forces and to establish more friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.
