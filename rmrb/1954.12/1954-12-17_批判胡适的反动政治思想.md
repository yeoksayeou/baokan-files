Criticizing Hu Shi's Reactionary Political Thought
Wang Zisong, Wang Qingshu, Zhang Enci, Tao Yang, Gan Lin

Under what historical conditions did Hu Shi put forward his "reformism"?

Hu Shi studied in the United States from 1910 to 1917 as a student of the second Boxer Indemnity Scholarship program. The reason why American imperialism wanted to "return" the Boxer Indemnity to recruit Chinese students was to better "control China's development" and "dominate China's leaders." Hu Shi received this kind of education and laid the foundation for his theories and actions. He himself said: "I am a person who pays attention to politics. When I was in college, political economy courses occupied one-third of my time" ("My Divergence"). During his study in the United States, he enthusiastically participated in political activities, discussing Far East issues with Taft, the most reactionary politician and former president of the United States at the time. He delivered a speech entitled "How Can the United States Assist China's Development" ("Study Diary," January 27, 1917). On the eve of returning to China in 1917, his diary entry after bidding farewell to his teacher, Dewey, the number one reactionary philosopher in the United States at the time, fully exposed how he was being "entrusted": "Yesterday I went to see Mr. Dewey to say goodbye. Mr. Dewey said that he was more concerned about international political issues than other matters. He instructed Shi to send him any comments on the Far East situation so that he could find a good place to publish them. I am deeply moved by these words, so I record them here" ("Study Diary," May 30, 1917).

When he returned to China in 1917 and heard the news of Zhang Xun's restoration, he saw the "ignorance" and "silence" in the cultural and educational circles in Shanghai, he said: "I just made up my mind not to talk about politics for twenty years" in order to first "build a foundation of innovation for Chinese politics in thought and literature" ("My Divergence").

Aren't these evidences clear enough that Hu Shi's academic work served his political propositions?

From 1917 to 1919, before the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shi participated in the New Culture Enlightenment Movement at that time. The struggle on the cultural front at that time still belonged to "the struggle between the new culture of the bourgeoisie and the old culture of the feudal class" (Mao Zedong: "On New Democracy"). Hu Shi participated in the united front at that time. However, before the May Fourth Movement, Li Dazhao had already promoted "the victory of Bolshevism," and Lu Xun had already published the revolutionary literary declaration of thorough anti-feudalism, "Diary of a Madman." Hu Shi only advocated some formal improvements to literature. Literary form improvements can certainly play a certain role in spreading new culture and new ideas. However, Hu Shi, as a representative of the bourgeois intellectuals, could only become the right wing of the movement at that time (the evaluation of Hu Shi's role before and after the May Fourth Movement is more complicated, and we plan to discuss it in a special article).

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "The outstanding historical significance of the May Fourth Movement lies in the fact that it adopted a posture that the Xinhai Revolution did not have, that is, thoroughly and uncompromisingly anti-imperialist and thoroughly and uncompromisingly anti-feudalist." ("On New Democracy") The thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement ran counter to Hu Shi's fundamental ideas. Therefore, as Comrade Qu Qiubai pointed out: "Not long after the May Fourth Movement, the Hu Shi faction in 'New Youth' surrendered" (Qu Qiubai: "Preface to 'Selected Essays by Lu Xun'").

The fact is so. After the "May Fourth" and "June Third" movements, a great patriotic movement swept the country, the influence of the October Revolution expanded, Marxism spread widely, and the workers' movement surged rapidly. It was in such a revolutionary upsurge that Hu Shi "couldn't bear it" and abandoned his "resolution not to talk about politics for twenty years," and moved from literary reformism to talking about political "reformism." As an introduction to his political "reformism," he wrote the notorious "Study More Problems, Talk Less About -isms."

Isn't it obvious that Hu Shi's purpose in "not being able to bear it" and putting forward his political "reformism" was to oppose the spread of Marxism-Leninism in China?

Hu Shi's "reformism" aims to oppose the Chinese people's revolutionary movement

Hu Shi himself believed that "experimentalism" was his basic method. He used "experimentalism" to talk about literature, history, philosophy, and politics. "Experimentalism starts from Darwinism, so it can only admit that continuous improvement bit by bit is real and reliable evolution." "There is absolutely no simple destination that can be jumped to in one step" ("Introducing My Own Thoughts"). Therefore, his "reformism" declaration is:

"Civilization is not created in a lump, but created bit by bit. Evolution is not a unified evolution overnight, but an evolution bit by bit..."

"The work of rebuilding civilization is the study of this and that problem. The progress of rebuilding civilization is the solution of this and that problem." ("The Significance of the New Thought Tide")

He does not admit of revolution with fundamental change, but only admits of a little bit of reform. According to his theory of reformism, he proposed "study more problems and talk less about -isms." He said that -isms are just "abstract nouns," and worshiping -isms will "blind intelligence and stop thinking." He wants to pay attention to "effects," so he wants to study "concrete problems" more and put forward "solutions."

It is necessary to first determine: What -ism is he opposing? Of course, he is not opposed to the "experimentalism" he advocates, but to Marxism-Leninism, which was widely disseminated among the people of the country at that time. Therefore, eleven years later, summing up this counter-revolutionary "ideological work," he couldn't help but tell the truth in joy and pride:

"My thousands of words here are just to teach people a method of not being deceived. It is certainly not clever to be led by the nose by Confucius and Zhu Xi; it is also not a good thing to be led by the nose by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin" ("Introducing My Own Thoughts"). The words "being led by the nose by Confucius and Zhu Xi" are just a foil. "Being led by the nose by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin" is what he is truly most afraid of and opposed to.

He has a very honest confession: "At that time, after 'May Fourth' and 'June Third,' the country was trending towards talking about -isms. I anticipated the danger of this trend, so I issued a warning: 'Study More Problems, Talk Less About -isms'" ("Introducing My Own Thoughts"). Originally, in the eyes of the counter-revolutionaries, the people's revolutionary cause is, of course, "dangerous." Unfortunately, despite Hu Shi's many tricks, he finally couldn't stop the fire of the people's revolution. The revolution rose day by day, causing Hu Shi to sigh eleven years later: "The various dangers I foresaw more than ten years ago... have all appeared before my eyes" (ibid.).

In 1922, the Chinese Communist Party put forward the basic tasks of the Chinese people at that time, proposing to "overthrow the warlords" and "overthrow the oppression of international imperialism."

At this time, Hu Shi stood up and spoke. His article "International China" is truly a confession of a slavish traitor that should be notorious forever. At that time, the situation was: from the Twenty-One Demands to the aftermath of the European War, the powers attempted to divide China, and the three imperialist powers, Britain, the United States, and Japan, were in dispute. In 1922, the Washington Conference, presided over by the United States, reiterated "equal opportunity," stipulated that China should implement compensation to Japan on the Shandong issue, and jointly stipulated Chinese tariff regulations. The imperialists thus reached an agreement on jointly invading China. At such a time, Hu Shi actually said: Saying that imperialism invaded China "this kind of observation is very similar to rural people talking about strange overseas news, almost without any factual basis." "We must know that foreign investors' hope for peace and unity in China is no less than that of the Chinese people." "To be honest, there is no great danger of international aggression in China now... so we can now avoid having nightmares about international aggression." He even said: "The people only feel that the concessions and the Legation Quarter are blessed lands, foreign currency is priceless currency, the Inspector General of Customs is a god, and it is China's good fortune that customs and postal rights are in the hands of foreigners!" (It should be said that only bureaucrats, politicians, the Anfu clique, the Communications Clique, and the monarchists feel that the concessions and the Legation Quarter are blessed lands, only a few wealthy people feel that foreign currency is priceless currency, only a few bankers feel that the Inspector General of Customs is a god, and perhaps Mr. Hu Shi also feels this way, but we ordinary people don't think so. – The above editor's note is quoted from "Guide" No. 6)

The article "International China," as correctly judged by the "Guide" (No. 6) at the time: "is more obvious and powerful than the pro-American propaganda that the United States spends 30 million taels of silver each year to hire many pastors, reporters, detectives, consultants, scholars, etc. to do for us." This is truly a point well made.

Since Hu Shi believed that imperialist aggression against China was "overseas strange news" and feudalism had "collapsed two thousand years ago," then, in Hu Shi's view, these two targets of revolution no longer existed. So, what is the goal of Hu Shi's "reformism"? In 1930, Hu Shi published an article "Which Road Should We Take?" and replied: "We must overthrow five major enemies," which are poverty, disease, ignorance, corruption, and disturbance.

This is truly a distortion of right and wrong, and putting the cart before the horse. It is especially worth noting that the fifth "ghost"—"disturbance." Hu Shi listed the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in this "enemy," as well as the "internal strife" at that time (at that time, it was the Second Revolutionary Civil War, when the counter-revolutionary encirclement and suppression and the revolutionary counter-encirclement and suppression were fighting a life-and-death struggle.) is also the content of "disturbance." According to him, the fault does not lie with the counter-revolutionary side, because "the government in power, for the sake of self-defense, does not hesitate to accumulate the elite forces of the country to encircle and suppress" ("Introduction to National Construction Issues"). He also believes that warlords are not the source of "disturbance," because "warlords are the product of disturbance, and disturbances are mostly caused by long-gowned friends." Therefore, he concluded: "What so-called 'revolution' in the past twenty years was not caused by literati? What warlord struggle in the past twenty years was not caused by boring politicians? What communist riots in various places in recent years were not incited and organized by long-gowned comrades? These three items can encompass seven or eight out of ten of all disturbances" ("Reply to Mr. Liang Shuming").

So here we see a wonderful "argument": "Our real object of revolution" is these "five ghosts," and one of the "five ghosts" is "disturbance," and what he said about "disturbance" includes and mainly refers to the Chinese people's revolutionary cause. In the end, it turns out that Hu Shi's "real object of revolution" is the Chinese people's revolution. This is such a clear counter-revolutionary logic!

In 1930, Hu Shi said: "China's real enemy" is the so-called "five ghosts"; in 1949, Acheson said in the "White Paper" that China's main difficulty was "too much population." Although the wording is different, the truth is the same—they are all smokescreens used by imperialists against the Chinese people, that is: the Chinese people should not rise up to overthrow imperialist aggression in China, but their own "poverty," "ignorance," China's "too much population," etc.

Leading people by the nose into the "pile of old papers," this is the means by which the reformist Hu Shi carries out counter-revolutionary activities

Although Hu Shi opposed revolution, he rarely carried out counter-revolutionary activities in a positive and public way. He always played some tricks and used some magic weapons that were easy to confuse people and lead others by the nose.

As early as 1915, when Hu Shi was studying in the United States, Yuan Shikai signed the traitorous Twenty-One Demands, which aroused opposition from students studying in the United States. Hu Shi then published a "Public Letter to Students Studying Abroad," proposing that "our responsibility is to study" ("Study Diary," March 19, 1915). This public letter aroused public outrage among students studying in the United States. After returning to China, he almost sang the same old tune every time the student movement entered a climax. He always hypocritically said a few words first: Because "politics are too corrupt, so young students rise up to interfere in politics, this is the norm from ancient times to the present"; but, in a turn, it is: "The duty of students is to study, to forge themselves into useful tools, and then they can serve the country."

For example, after "May 30th," he wrote "Patriotic Movement and Studying" ("Modern Review," Vol. 2, No. 39), loudly appealing to young students:

"Can't you help it? Can't you stand the external stimulation? Your classmates are all out shouting, can't you stand their seduction and ridicule? Do you feel embarrassed sitting alone in the library? Are you uneasy? ... We can tell you one or two stories..." So he talked about how Goethe and Fichte were able to study and write with peace of mind during the enemy's siege, trying to lure young people to escape from the patriotic student movement and even deceive themselves that they were learning from Goethe and Fichte.

Here is another example: After "December 9th," Hu Shi published "A Word for the Student Movement" ("Independent Review," No. 128), slandering the student movement as "controlled and manipulated by a few people" and "superficial incitement." He said: "All blind obedience, credulity, dogmatism, oppression of the minority, deception of the masses, abuse of power, and destruction of the law are not things that young people in the era of education should advocate, so they are not methods of the student movement." (It should be said that the real blind obedience, credulity, dogmatism, oppression of the minority, deception of the masses, and abuse of power are Hu Shi and other academic tyrants themselves.) More blatant and noteworthy is that he wanted students not to destroy Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial "law," but he tacitly allowed the Chiang bandits, military police, and secret agents to have the "freedom" to destroy the law by shooting and killing students. This is what Mr. Lu Xun revealed in his poem mocking the "helping writer" Hu Shi: "Doctorate from the head of the cultural class, human rights discarded in favor of royal power, the court has always been full of massacres, this principle is now transmitted through experiment" ("Wangdao Poetry Talk," see Lu Xun: "Pseudo-Freedom Book"). Hu Shi said: "A group of young people who are confusedly led by the nose will never have real power in school, and will only be fit to be obedient people and slaves after leaving school." The fact is that there were indeed some people in the past who, because they had some individualistic plans, were thus confusedly lured by Hu Shi with individualism and led by the nose away from the ranks of the revolution to pursue the good dream of imitating Goethe and Fichte. As a result, they often became obedient people of Chiang Kai-shek and slaves of American imperialism!

Hu Shi's counter-revolutionary methods are by no means limited to undermining the student movement. He also arranged textual research, reorganized national studies, wrote new poems such as "A Pair of Yellow Butterflies," etc. to lure you into taking the bait. He has universities, research institutes, places for students to study abroad, positions as university professors, the titles of "scholars," etc. beckoning you. I don't know how many people, because they have individualistic plans, were led by the nose to examine the seating arrangements for the "Longevity Yihong Ladies' Night Feast," etc.

From this, we can see the reactionary role played by the bourgeois individualistic ideas promoted by Hu Shi. The twelfth issue of "Guide" in 1922 had already evaluated Hu Shi's cultural movement:

"What is the result of the cultural movement? He just drove those students who took saving the country as their responsibility back to the classroom, and made those leaders in the May Fourth Movement learn to write new poems, produce vernacular publications, study abroad, and go to the research room to study literature, philosophy, and science, and to reorganize national studies." Hu Shi played the biggest role in this work and made great efforts for imperialism and the counter-revolutionary rulers.

Hu Shi's reformist political propositions, such as "good people government," etc., are just deceptive facades, which hide the essence of counter-revolution

Since Hu Shi advocates that in politics there can only be "a little bit of reform," then let's see what "a little bit of reform" opinions he has. But in this regard, Hu Shi is really shockingly poor! On the surface, it seems that he has put forward many propositions that are truly bizarre and all-encompassing, but on closer analysis, these propositions have no content at all and are just deceptive nonsense.

In 1922 and later, in the Beijing government ruled by the Northern Warlords, which was an era of warlord separatism, he proposed a "good people government." He advocated "federalism," demanded "public finance," and "supervision of finance." After 1933, in the era of Chiang Kai-shek's white terror rule, he advocated "rule of law," asked the Kuomintang to "abandon party rule," advocated "democracy," did not advocate unification by force, but advocated "political unification." When Chiang Kai-shek wanted to learn from Mussolini and Hitler, he proposed that "China has no need or possibility of dictatorship." On the rural issue, he proposed "political laissez-faire," calling for "cutting officials, stopping construction, and demobilizing troops." In particular, he had been demanding a "constitution" since 1922, and even proposed a "Draft Law on the Organization of the National Assembly" at the "Post-War Conference" convened by the Northern Warlord Duan Qirui. When he asked Chiang Kai-shek to "abandon party rule" and advocate "rule of law," he greatly praised the "May 5th Constitution Draft," which actually consolidated Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship. In the end, when Chiang Kai-shek convened a pseudo-National Assembly in Nanjing in 1947, Hu Shi actually went to be a representative and granted Chiang Kai-shek a "constitution."

It is because of these propositions that Hu Shi has won the reputation of "legalist" and "democrat" in the minds of some naive and short-sighted people. But a little analysis will show that these propositions are not "rule of law" and "democracy" at all, but a thorough counter-revolutionary and sinful conspiracy.

What is the so-called "good people government" in reality? Just look at Hu Shi's series of activities: In 1925, Hu Shi participated in Duan Qirui's "Post-War Conference" (which Duan Qirui convened in order to resist Sun Yat-sen's plan to go north to convene a national assembly); in 1933, when Chiang Kai-shek was conducting counter-revolutionary civil war everywhere, Hu Shi and Jiang Tingfu were supporters of Chiang Kai-shek's "internal pacification before resisting foreign aggression"; in 1933, when the "People's Government" of Fujian was established and proposed to "abolish party rule," he said: "'Abolishing party rule' sounds good, but it should not be used as a slogan to launch a civil war in this critical period" ("The Great Change in Fujian," Independent Review, No. 79); in August 1935, after the traitorous "He-Umezu Agreement" was signed under Chiang Kai-shek's direction and consent, the CCP's declaration calling for a united front was supported by the people of the country, and Hu Shi advised Chiang Kai-shek "not to be a dictator" but to "learn from the Xiyuan clan," saying that Chiang Kai-shek "because he is not on the front of the government, the form of dictatorship is reduced, so his leadership position has increased" ("The Great Road of Political Reform," Independent Review, No. 136).

The true face of the "helping writer's" "big praise and small criticism" is like this!

If the analysis of Hu Shi's political propositions stops here, it is far from enough. We must further pursue: Why does he have these propositions?

For example, in 1922, large and small warlords in various provinces across the country implemented armed separatism and carried out a long-term civil war. At that time, the big warlords actively advocated unification by force, that is, merging small warlords. Therefore, some small warlords, such as Zhao Hengti, Tang Jiyao, Chen Jiongming, etc., advocated "federalism" in order to maintain their separatist territories. At this time, Hu Shi also came out and shouted that "China is not suitable for a single national organization" and must be "federalism." But why, after 1933, when Chiang Kai-shek merged other small warlords as a large warlord, did Hu Shi come out and advocate "unification"? There is no other reason: After World War I, American imperialism invaded China with strong economic power, but politically, China had already been occupied by British, Japanese, and other imperialists. Therefore, American imperialism at that time tried its best to win "open door, equal opportunity." At the same time, it was not willing to let the large warlords Duan Qirui and Wu Peifu, supported by Japanese, British, and other imperialists, unify China by force, as this would not benefit the United States. What American imperialism needed was for the warlords of various provinces to divide and rule, and then dominate China through economic aggression. Therefore, Hu Shi tried his best to advocate "federalism" and "supervision of finance." (In order to "supervise 'finance,'" Hu Shi, who had always opposed strikes, even advocated that if "public finance" could not be achieved, "everyone should strike together," the court should close, the prison should strike, the bank should strike, and various agencies should stop at the same time" – May 1922, Endeavor Weekly)

It can be seen that to understand Hu Shi's political propositions, we must examine them in connection with the American imperialist policy of aggression against China in each period in order to recognize the truth.

Hu Shi, who originally advocated that "China is not suitable for a single national organization," why did he propose in 1932: "Our great difficulty is that our society has no center of gravity, just like a body without a nerve center"? He suddenly proposed that China's "reform" could not succeed because it lacked a "center of gravity." What is the center of gravity? How can there be a center of gravity? He analyzed that the reason why China has no "center of gravity" is because: "First, it is too far away from the feudal era; second, the belief in the monarchy has been completely destroyed by the too undignified late Qing Dynasty; third, after the prevalence of the imperial examination, the social classes have been too equalized; fourth, the people are too poor and there is no powerful bourgeoisie; fifth, education is too unpopular and too immature, and there is no powerful intellectual class: with these five reasons, we can say that there is no natural candidate for the social center of gravity" (the above quotations are all from "Painful Memories and Reflections"). In other words, according to Hu Shi: If the feudal era still existed, if the monarchy still existed, if the aristocratic class still existed, if there was a powerful bourgeoisie or "intellectual class," Chinese society could have a "center of gravity," and the "great difficulty" would no longer exist. This is completely speaking on behalf of imperialism. In order to expand its aggression in China, imperialism can use any feudal, monarchical, aristocratic, bourgeois, or intellectual, as long as it is beneficial to it and willing to listen to its orders. Acheson repeatedly mentioned in the White Paper that the United States' policy in China was encouraged by two goals: "One goal is to achieve peace in China under the condition that the government can tend to stabilize and progress along the democratic path; the other goal is to assist the National Government in establishing its authority in as large an area as possible in China."

It was for this "purpose" that when Chiang Kai-shek leaned towards American imperialism, Hu Shi came out to advocate that society should have a "center of gravity" and advocated "political unification." It was also for the purpose of "the government can tend to stabilize" that when the Chiang bandit regime was on the verge of collapse in 1947 and convened the stinking pseudo-"National Assembly," Hu Shi was ordered to go to Nanjing to praise it. As Hu Shi himself confessed: "Having become a pawn that has crossed the river, one has to fight desperately forward." Isn't the question clear enough? Hu Shi is the "pawn that has crossed the river" that American imperialism sent across the Pacific.

Hu Shi's comprador culture is used to "conquer the hearts of Chinese people" for American imperialism

On February 24, 1933, Hu Shi answered Bernard Shaw's question: "Yes, Japan can never conquer China by force. Japan has only one way to conquer China, and that is to rein in its horse at the precipice, completely stop invading China, and turn around to conquer the hearts of the Chinese people" ("The Japanese Should Wake Up," Independent Review, No. 42). Hu Shi probably revealed this great secret because he met Bernard Shaw and wanted to show his clever mind! The Japanese are naturally not so smart, so they can only do some "stupid things" of armed aggression. But there is a "smart" imperialism that uses a "smart" slave, has been doing the work of "conquering the hearts of Chinese people," and this work has been quite successful. This "smart" imperialism is American imperialism. This "smart" slave is Hu Shi himself. The reactionary ideas of "pro-American and worshiping the United States" that were prevalent among some intellectuals in our country in the past are the concrete achievements of Hu Shi and others in "conquering the hearts of Chinese people."

Hu Shi is well-versed in the ancient sage books that discuss the art of feudal rule and understands the principle of "attacking the heart" as the top priority, but his skills are not genuine domestic products. Starting in 1909, the United States returned China's Boxer Indemnity and used this money to attract Chinese students to study in the United States and to run schools and hospitals in China. Why do this? At that time, an American university president James wrote a memorandum to President Roosevelt very clearly:

"Which country can educate this generation of young Chinese people, that country will, due to the efforts paid in this area, retrieve the greatest possible harvest in spiritual and commercial influence. If the United States had managed to attract the tide of Chinese students to this country 30 years ago and could continue to expand this trend, then we would now be able to use the most complete and subtle way to control China's development - that is to say, use the way that dominates China's leaders from knowledge and spirit."

Hu Shi is such a character cultivated by American imperialism. When he was in the United States, he had already won the favor of important imperialist figures such as Taft and Dewey. In their minds, Hu Shi is an ideal "Chinese leader" figure! Therefore, when Hu Shi returned from the United States, he planned to sell this set of goods for American imperialism. Thirty years of political activities have proved that Hu Shi is serving American imperialism in culture, thought, and spirit to "conquer the hearts of Chinese people," so that Chinese people not only do not hate American imperialism, but can even be willing to accept American imperialism's aggression. Hu Shi's entire "achievement" lies in this. This is also "using the most complete and subtle way to control China's development."

Hu Shi has done too many "achievements" in this regard, which are worth collecting carefully by experts in the history of imperialist aggression against China. It is impossible to finish speaking in this short article. We can only briefly mention a few points now:

First, promote anti-patriotism "cosmopolitanism":

Hu Shi's study diary on March 7, 1917, "On 'Leaving the Wayless and Following the Wayful,'" said that he saw Wang Renqiu's "Leaving the Wayless and Following the Wayful" ten years ago and felt ashamed, but now, "in the past ten years, my thinking has also changed" (that is to say: he has been "educated" by American imperialism). "Fairly speaking," if one's own country is not good, then what is wrong with defecting to another "good" country? Please see his argument:

"If Yuan Shikai and Wilson are to be chosen, then people must choose Wilson. Those who choose Yuan Shikai because Wilson is a foreign race must be foolish people poisoned by nationalism. This is the meaning of 'Leaving the Wayless and Following the Wayful.'" Hu Shi is shameless to this extent. Why can only choose between Yuan Shikai, the representative of feudal forces, and Wilson, the representative of imperialism? Can't we find a revolutionary leader who loves the motherland among the Chinese nation? Does the Chinese nation have to sell the motherland and defect to imperialism with Hu Shi?

Let's see how Hu Shi evaluated the "May Fourth" sixteen years later:

"Although the 'May Fourth' Movement was a very pure patriotic movement, the literary and ideological movement at that time was not a narrow nationalist movement. Mr. Cai Yuanpei's proposition obviously had a 'worldview' color... In fact, Mr. Sun Yat-sen also held a cosmopolitanism, and he believed in the ideal of 'the world is for the public'... But nationalism has three aspects: the most superficial is xenophobia, the second is to support the inherent culture of the country..." ("Individual Freedom and Social Progress," Independent Review, No. 150). Look, he shamelessly slandered the Chinese people's revolutionary movement against imperialism as "the most superficial xenophobia," and shamelessly slandered Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Cai Yuanpei in this way. The characteristic of intellectuals of the comprador bourgeoisie is that they have no national position at all, not only do not oppose imperialism, but also support imperialist aggression. Hu Shi's attempt to pull Sun Yat-sen and Cai Yuanpei as his own "comrades" is truly the most shameless behavior.

Only a foreign slave like Hu Shi can shamelessly slander the "May Fourth" Movement in this way:

"Moreover, when we see those thousands of students shouting 'Long live the Great America! Long live President Wilson! Long live the Great Republic of China! Long live the perpetual peace of the world!' in front of the American embassy on May 4, we cannot but admit that the Wilsonianism that aroused optimism in all mankind was indeed a driving force of the May Fourth Movement."

(Celebrating "May Fourth," Independent Review, No. 149) Only under Hu Shi's pen can such shameless words be written, and only under Hu Shi's pen can black and white be reversed to say that the "May Fourth" Movement, which took opposition to imperialism as its driving force, was driven by the notorious "Wilsonianism" of American imperialism. Don't forget that it was this Wilson who supported Japan's inheritance of rights in Shandong at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.

Second, in order to promote his "cosmopolitanism," he tried his best to create various myths that "the United States is China's best friend." But the imperialists who invaded China will never become friends of the Chinese people, so he shamelessly manipulated his subjective idealism philosophy to turn white into black and black into white in order to deceive the Chinese people. Here is a typical example.

On September 18, Japanese imperialism forcibly occupied our Northeast. The American and British imperialists, who were originally competing with Japan in China, were in the midst of their own economic panic, and although they wanted to interfere with Japan's attempt to monopolize China, they were unable to do so and had to turn a blind eye and let it go. The "League of Nations" at that time sent a "Lytton Survey Team" to China, and the conclusion was that the "League of Nations" should "co-manage the Northeast" (which is actually "partition"). But Japanese imperialism did not even accept this opinion and kept attacking south of Jinzhou. The British imperialists simply ignored this matter, while the American imperialists, due to the foundation of aggression they had built in China for more than ten years after the European War, were unwilling to give up their interests in China, but had no better way to compete with Japan. So the then Secretary of State Stimson put forward a "non-recognition doctrine" (that is, actually let Japan occupy the Northeast, but verbally adopt a non-recognition method). This is a struggle caused by the uneven distribution of spoils among imperialists. But how does Hu Shi confuse right and wrong?

Hu Shi called the "Report of the Lytton Survey Team" "a report representing world public opinion" (should be read as: a report representing the private opinions of American and British imperialists). He said:

"...The Survey Team's suggestion is to say: these three provinces have already been violently drawn out of the scope of China by others, and now they may be able to return to the scope of China in the form of autonomous provinces." You see, under Hu Shi's pen, the "foreign adults" are truly "good friends" worthy of "grateful tears." But the Survey Team also suggested disarming the Chinese army in the Northeast. How to explain this? In Hu Shi's view: "The reason is very simple... Chinese soldiers cannot defend the territory" (all quotations in this section are from "Independent Review" No. 21).

What can be as notorious as his "International China" is the "Postscript to Mr. Jiang Tingfu's Paper" published in the 45th issue of "Independent Review" in 1933. He said:

"For ten years... the national political forces have not been used to transform the country's politics, but have been used to incite xenophobia, and to shout slogans to overthrow imperialism..." Then he expressed great dissatisfaction with the words in "Eastern Magazine" that "the tragedy and comedy of imperialist division of China has been transferred from the scene of political and diplomatic struggles in Geneva to the scene of armed struggles in the Pacific":

"This kind of discussion is completely a string of fabricated names playing tricks there. Behind the nouns, if it is not malicious obliteration of facts, it is ignorant dogmatism... This phenomenon is truly a phenomenon of national subjugation." "After the Revolutionary Conference, countries that only seek to trade in China are more eager for China's self-reliance, sometimes even more than the Chinese. On this point, the interests of these countries can be said to be the same as the interests of China (should be read as: the interests of the comprador Hu Shi are the same as the interests of these countries), because they know that a rich and powerful China must be a larger and more beneficial market for them." (Indeed a comprador identity, never forgetting the market!) "Only a modernized China can fundamentally solve the Far East problem. The League of Nations can give us the most reliable and least dangerous assistance... Fully understand this situation, and then we can boldly utilize European and American capital and technical cooperation to promote China's modernization. Although this is a roundabout road, it may be the fastest road" (should be read as: the fastest road to sell the country).

The reason why we want to quote at length here is not only to expose Hu Shi's comprador slavish thinking of recognizing thieves as fathers, but also to let friends who have had pro-American and worshiping-the-United States thoughts "look in the mirror" so that they can be educated from here. Let us work together to resolutely fight against this most ugly thought!

Third, in order to lay the foundation for the thought of worshiping the United States, Hu Shi desperately promoted national inferiority.

Hu Shi said: "Today's first priority is to create a new psychology: to be willing to admit mistakes, to admit with great enlightenment that we are a hundred times inferior to others"

    批判胡适的反动政治思想
    汪子嵩　王庆淑　张恩慈  陶阳　甘霖
    在什么历史条件下，胡适提出了他的“改良主义”
    胡适在一九一○到一九一七年留学美国，是第二期庚款留美学生。美帝国主义所以要“退回”庚款用以招收中国留学生是为了能更好的“控制中国的发展”“支配中国的领袖”，胡适就是接受这种教育而奠定他的理论和行动基础的。他自己说：“我是一个注意政治的人。当我在大学时，政治经济的功课占了我三分之一的时间”（“我的歧路”）。在美国留学时间热心参加政治活动，与美国当时最反动的政客、前任总统塔虎脱讨论远东问题。发表  “美国能如何协助中国之发达”的演说（“留学日记”一九一七年一月二十七日）。一九一七年回国前夕，他在辞别他的老师——当时美国第一号反动哲学家杜威后所记的日记就充分暴露了他是怎样受着“嘱托”的：“昨往见杜威先生辞行，先生言其关心于国际政局之问题乃过于他事。嘱适有关于远东时局之言论，若寄彼处，当代为觅善地发表之。此言至可感念，故记之”（“留学日记”一九一七年五月三十日）。
    当他一九一七年回到中国，听见张勋复辟的消息，到上海看到了文化教育界的“孤陋”与“沉寂”时，他说：“我方才打定二十年不谈政治的决心”，为的是先要“在思想文艺上替中国政治建筑一个革新的基础”（“我的歧路”）。
    胡适的学术工作是为他的政治主张服务的，这些证据难道还不够清楚吗？
    从一九一七年到一九一九年“五四”以前，胡适参加了当时的新文化启蒙运动。当时的文化战线上的斗争，还是属于“资产阶级的新文化和封建阶级的旧文化的斗争”（毛泽东：“新民主主义论”）。胡适参加了当时的统一战线。但在“五四”以前，李大钊已经宣传“布尔什维克主义的胜利”，鲁迅已经发表了彻底反封建的革命文学的宣言“狂人日记”，胡适只不过是主张对文学作些形式上的改良而已。文学形式的改良对传播新文化、新思想当然还可以起一定的作用。然而，胡适作为资产阶级知识分子的代表，只能成为当时运动中的右翼（关于胡适在“五四”运动前后的作用的评价问题，比较复杂，我们准备专文讨论）。
    毛泽东同志指出：“‘五四’运动的杰出的历史意义，在于它带着为辛亥革命还不曾有的姿态，这就是彻底地不妥协地反帝国主义和彻底地不妥协地反封建主义。”（“新民主主义论”）彻底地反帝反封建的革命运动是与胡适的根本思想背道而驰的，因而正如瞿秋白同志所指出的：“‘五四’之后不久，‘新青年’之中的胡适之派，也就投降了”（瞿秋白：“‘鲁迅杂感选集’序言”）。
    事实就是如此。“五四”“六三”之后，全国掀起了一个爱国的大运动，十月革命的影响日益扩大了，马克思主义广泛传播，工人运动迅速高涨。就是在这样的革命高涨中，胡适就“忍不住”了，抛弃了他“二十年不谈政治的决心”，从文学上的改良主义进而大谈其政治上的“改良主义”了，作为他的政治上的“改良主义”的导言的，就是那篇臭名昭著的“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”。
    胡适所以“忍不住”提出他的政治上的“改良主义”来，其目的是为了反对马克思列宁主义在中国的传播，难道这不明显吗？
    胡适的“改良主义”的目的，是反对中国人民的革命运动
    胡适自己认为“实验主义”是他的基本方法，他是用“实验主义”来谈文学，历史，哲学和政治的。“实验主义从达尔文主义出发，故只能承认一点一滴的不断的改进是真实可靠的进化。”“决没有一个简单的目的地可以一步跳到”（“介绍我自己的思想”）。所以，他的“改良主义”的宣言是：
    “文明不是拢统造成的，是一点一滴的造成的。进化不是一晚上拢统进化的，是一点一滴的进化的……”
    “再造文明的下手工夫是这个那个问题的研究。再造文明的进行是这个那个问题的解决。”（“新思潮的意义”）
    他不承认有根本改变的革命，只承认有一点一滴的改良。根据他这种改良主义的理论，他就提出“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”。他说主义只是“抽象的名词”，崇拜主义是会“蒙蔽聪明，停止思想”的。他要讲究“效果”，所以要多研究“具体的问题”，提出“解决的方法”。
    要先判明：究竟他反对的是什么主义？当然不是反对他所主张的“实验主义”，而是当时在全国人民中间得到广泛传播的马克思列宁主义。所以十一年之后，他总结这一段反革命的“思想工作”，在高兴和骄傲之余，不由得吐露出真话：
    “我这里千言万语，也只是要教人一个不受人惑的方法。被孔丘朱熹牵着鼻子走，固然不算高明；被马克思列宁斯大林牵着鼻子走，也算不得好汉。”（“介绍我自己的思想”）“被孔丘朱熹牵着鼻子走”的话只是陪衬，“被马克思列宁斯大林牵着鼻子走”，才是他真心最害怕的、最反对的事情。
    他有很老实的自供：“当时承‘五四’‘六三’之后，国内正倾向于谈主义。我预料到这个趋势的危险，故发表‘多研究些问题，少谈些主义’的警告。”（“介绍我自己的思想”）原来人民的革命事业，在反革命者看来，当然就是“危险”的了。可惜的是，尽管胡适耍了许多花招，但终于挡不住人民革命的怒火，革命一天比一天高涨，使得十一年后，胡适不得不叹息着说：“十几年前我所预料的种种危险，……一一都显现在眼前了。”（同上篇）
    一九二二年，中国共产党提出了中国人民当时的基本任务，提出“打倒军阀”“推翻国际帝国主义的压迫”。
    就在这时，胡适起来说话了。他的“国际的中国”一文，真是应该遗臭万年的洋奴卖国贼的供状。当时的时局是：从二十一条到欧战后，列强企图瓜分中国，英、美、日三个帝国主义争执不下，一九二二年正是在美国所主持的华盛顿会议上重申“机会均等”，规定中国在山东问题上对日本实行赔偿，并共同规定中国关税税则。帝国主义者就是这样的达成了共同侵略中国的协议。而在这样的时候，胡适居然说：说帝国主义侵略中国“这种观察很像乡下人谈海外奇闻，几乎全无事实上的根据。”“我们要知道：外国投资者的希望中国和平与统一，实在不下于中国人民的希望和平与统一。”“老实说，现在中国已没有很大的国际侵略的危险了。……所以我们现在尽可以不必去做那怕国际侵略的噩梦。”他甚至于说出：“人民只觉得租界与东交民巷是福地，外币是金不换的货币，总税务司是神人，海关邮政权在外人手里是中国的幸事！”（应该说是：租界和东交民巷只有官僚政客，安福系、交通系、帝制派觉得是福地，外币只有少数富翁觉得是金不换的货币，总税务司只有少数银行家觉得是神人，胡适先生或者也这样觉得，我们小百姓倒不觉得是这样。——以上按语引自“向导”第六期）
    “国际的中国”这篇文章，正像当时“向导”（第六期）所正确评判的：“比美国每年花上三千万银子雇派许多牧师，记者，侦探，顾问，学者等向我们所做的亲美宣传，还更明显而且有力。”这真是一语道破。
    既然胡适认为帝国主义侵略中国是“海外奇闻”，封建主义则是“二千年前就已经崩坏了”，那么，在胡适看来这两个革命的对象就都没有了，然则胡适的“改良主义”还有什么目标呢？一九三○年胡适发表了“我们走那条路？”一文，回答说：“我们要打倒五个大仇敌”是贫穷、疾病、愚昧、贪污、扰乱。
    这真是是非颠倒，本末倒置的鬼话。特别值得注意的是那第五个“鬼”—“扰乱”。胡适把太平天国列在这个“仇敌”里面，还有当时的“内乱”（当时正是第二次国内革命战争，反革命的围剿与革命的反围剿进行生死搏斗的时候。）也是“扰乱”的内容，而依他说来，过错不在反革命这方面，因为“当国的政府、为了自卫起见，也就不惜积聚全国的精锐兵力去围剿”（“建国问题引论”）。他还认为军阀不是“扰乱”的根源，因为“军阀是扰乱的产物，而扰乱大抵皆是长衫朋友所造成。”因此，他总结道：“二十年来所谓‘革命’，何一非文人所造成？二十年中的军阀斗争，何一非无聊政客所挑拨造成的？近年各地的共产党暴动，又何一非长衫同志所煽动组织的？此三项已可概括一切扰乱的十之七八了”（“答梁漱溟先生”）。
    于是我们在这里看到一个绝妙的“论证”：“我们革命的真正对象”是这“五鬼”，而“五鬼”之一就是“扰乱”，而他所说的“扰乱”包括了而且主要就是指中国人民的革命事业。说来说去，原来胡适的“革命的真正对象”就是中国人民的革命，这是多么明白的反革命的逻辑！
    一九三○年胡适说：“中国真正的敌人”是所谓“五鬼”；一九四九年艾奇逊在“白皮书”中说中国主要的困难是“人口太多”。说法虽有不同，道理却是一个——都是帝国主义者对中国人民使的障眼法，那就是：中国人民应该起来打倒的不是帝国主义在中国的侵略，而是中国人自己的“贫穷”“愚昧”，中国“人口太多”等等。
  牵着人的鼻子到“故纸堆”里去，这就是改良主义者胡适进行反革命活动的手段
    胡适虽然反对革命，但他进行反革命活动，起先很少是正面的、公开的来进行的，总要耍一些花招，用一些容易迷惑人，容易牵着别人鼻子走的法宝。
    早在一九一五年胡适在美国留学时，袁世凯签订了卖国契约二十一条，引起留美学生的反对。胡适当时发表了“致留学生公函”，提出“我们的责任是学习”（“留学日记”一九一五年三月十九日）这封公函引起留美学生的公愤。在回国以后，每次学生运动进入高潮时，他几乎都唱同一的滥调。他总是假惺惺的先说几句：因为“政治太腐败了，所以青年学生起来干预政治，这是古今一例的”；但是，一转就是：“学生的职责是读书，将自己铸造成器，然后才能报国”。
    例如“五卅”以后，他写了“爱国运动与求学”（“现代评论”二卷三十九期），大声疾呼的对青年学生说：
    “你忍不住吗？你受不住外面的刺激吗？你的同学都出去呐喊了，你受不了他们的引诱与讥笑吗？你独坐图书馆里觉得难为情吗？你心里不安吗？……我们可以告诉你一两个故事……。”于是他便大谈起歌德和菲希特怎样在敌人围城时安心读书与著作的故事，企图引诱青年人从爱国的学生运动中逃脱出来，还可以欺骗自己说是在学歌德和菲希特呢。
    再举一个例子：“一二九”之后，胡适发表了“为学生运动进一言”（“独立评论”第一二八号），污蔑学生运动为“少数人的把持操纵”，是“浅薄的煽惑”。他说：“凡盲从、轻信、武断、压迫少数，欺骗群众，假公济私，破坏法律，都不是受教育时代的青年人应该提倡的，所以都不是学生运动的方法。”（应该说：真正的盲从、轻信、武断、压迫少数，欺骗群众，假公济私的乃是胡适等学阀自己）更露骨的和值得注意的是他要学生不要破坏蒋介石的卖国的、独裁的“法律”，他却默许蒋匪、军警、特务有开枪杀害学生的破坏法律的“自由”。这就是鲁迅先生在他的嘲骂“帮忙文人”胡适的诗中所揭破的：“文化班头博士衔，人权抛却说王权，朝廷自古多屠戮，此理今凭实验传。”（“王道诗话”，见鲁迅：“伪自由书”）胡适说：“一群被人糊里糊涂牵着鼻子走的少年人，在学校时决不会有真力量，出了校门也只配做顺民，做奴隶而已。”事实是，过去倒确是有一些人，因为自己有些个人主义的打算，就这样糊里糊涂地被胡适用个人主义引诱着，被他牵着鼻子离开了革命的行列，去做那模仿歌德与菲希特的好梦。结果往往就做了蒋介石的顺民，美帝国主义的奴才！
    胡适这样的反革命手段决不只限于破坏学生运动，他还安排下考据，整理国故，写“一双黄蝴蝶”的新诗等等引你去上钩。他那里有大学，有研究院，有留学生的名额，有大学教授的位置，有“学者”的名衔等等在招引你。不知有多少人就因有个人主义的打算，就被他牵着鼻子去考证“寿怡红群芳开夜宴”的席次等等。
    由此我们可以看出胡适宣传的资产阶级个人主义的思想所起的反动作用。一九二二年的“向导”十二期上就已为胡适文化运动作过评价了：
    “文化运动发生什么结果呢？他不过把那些以救国为己任的学生们赶回课堂，使那些五四运动中的领袖们学着做新诗，做白话文的出版物，出洋留学，到研究室去研究文学、哲学、科学去了，整理国故去了。”胡适在这个工作里起了最大的作用，为帝国主义和反革命统治者出了很大的力量。
  胡适改良主义的政治主张“好人政府”等等，只是骗人的幌子，它隐藏着反革命的实质
    胡适既然主张在政治上只能是“一点一滴的改良”，那么，我们看看他有些什么“一点一滴的改良”的意见吧。可是在这方面胡适实在贫乏得惊人！表面上看来他提出很多主张倒真是光怪陆离，无奇不有，可是仔细分析起来，这些主张实在毫无内容，不过是些骗人的鬼话而已。
    一九二二年及以后，在北洋军阀统治着的北京政府是军阀割据的时代，他提出“好人政府”，他主张“联省自治”，要求“财政公开”，“监督财政”。一九三三年以后在蒋介石白色恐怖统治时代，他主张“法治”，要国民党“放弃党治”，主张“民治”，不主张武力统一而主张“政治统一”。在蒋介石想学墨索里尼和希特勒的时候，他提出“中国无独裁之必要与可能”。在农村问题上，他提出“政治上的无为主义”，要“裁官，停止建设，裁兵”。特别是他从一九二二年开始就要求有“宪法”，在北洋军阀段祺瑞召开的“善后会议”上还提出过一个“国民会议组织法草案”。在他要求蒋介石“放弃党治”主张“法治”的时候，他却大捧实际上巩固蒋介石独裁的“五五宪草”。到最后，一九四七年蒋介石在南京召开伪国大的时候，胡适还居然去当代表，授予蒋介石以“宪法”。
    就因为这些主张，在一些幼稚浅见的人的心目中，胡适便赢得了“法治主义者”与“民治主义者”的美名，但稍稍分析一下，便可以知道他这些主张就根本不是什么“法治”和“民治”，而是彻底的反革命的罪恶阴谋。
    所谓“好人政府”的主张，实际上是什么呢？那只要看胡适的一连串活动就可以知道：一九二五年胡适参加段祺瑞的“善后会议”（这是段祺瑞为了抵制孙中山北上想召开国民会议而开的）；一九三三年蒋介石正是到处进行反革命内战的时候，胡适和蒋廷黻是蒋介石“攘外必先安内”的拥护者；一九三三年福建“人民政府”成立，提出要“取消党治”的时候，他就说：“‘取消党治’固然好听，但不可在这个危急的时期借这种口号来发动内战”（“福建的大变局”独立评论七九期）；一九三五年八月，在蒋介石指使和同意下的卖国的“何梅协定”签订后，中共发出的号召统一战线的宣言得到全国人民拥护，胡适劝蒋介石“不要做独裁者”、而要“学西园氏”，说蒋介石“因为不当政府的正面，独裁的形式减少了，所以他的领袖地位更增高了。”（“政治改革的大路”，独立评论一三六期）
    “帮忙文人”的“大捧小骂”的真面目就是如此！
    如果将胡适的政治主张分析至此为止，还是远不够的。还须再进一步追究：为什么他有这些主张呢？
    比如一九二二年，全国各省大小军阀纷纷实行武力割据，进行长期内战。当时大的军阀积极主张武力统一即兼并小军阀，所以有些小军阀如赵恒惕、唐继尧、陈炯明等为了保持割据地盘、提倡“联省自治”。胡适这时候也出来大叫“中国不适宜于单一的国家组织”，而必须是“联省自治”。但何以在一九三三年以后，蒋介石以大军阀并吞其他小军阀时，胡适又出来主张“统一”呢？此中道理无他：第一次世界大战以后，美帝挟雄厚的经济力量侵入中国、但在政治上，中国早已被日英等帝国主义所霸占。所以美帝国主义当时一方面竭力争取“门户开放，机会均等”，同时也不甘心让日、英帝国主义支持的大军阀段祺瑞、吴佩孚等来武力统一中国，这样对美国没有好处。美帝国主义需要的是让各省军阀分治，然后通过经济侵略来独霸中国。所以胡适当时竭力主张“联省自治”和“监督财政”。（为了要“监督‘财政’，一直反对罢工的胡适竟也主张如果做不到‘财政公开’就‘一齐罢工’，法庭关门，监狱罢工，银行罢市以及各机关同时停止”——一九二二年五月努力周报）
    可见我们要了解胡适的政治主张，必须和每一时期美帝对中国的侵略政策联系起来考察，才能认清真相。
    原来主张“中国不适宜于单一的国家组织”的胡适，为什么到一九三二年却提出来：我们的“大困难就是我们的社会没有重心，就像一个身体没有一个神经中枢”呢？他忽然提出来：中国“维新”所以不能成功，是因为缺乏一个“重心”。重心是什么呢？怎样才算有重心呢？他分析中国所以没有“重心”，是因为：“一则离开封建时代太远了，二则对于君主政体的信念已被那太不像样的满清末期完全毁坏了，三则科举盛行以后社会的阶级已太平等化了，四则人民太贫穷了没有一个有势力的资产阶级，五则教育太不普及又太幼稚了，没有一个有势力的智识阶级：有这五个原因，我们可以说是没有一个天然候补的社会重心”（以上引文均见“惨痛的回忆与反省”）。换句话说，照胡适看来：如果封建时代还存在，如果君主政体还存在，如果贵族的阶级还存在，如果有个有势力的资产阶级或“智识阶级”，中国社会便可以有个“重心”，“大困难”就不再存在了。这完全是代表帝国主义在说话。帝国主义为了要在中国扩大侵略势力，只要对它有利，肯听他吩咐，什么封建，君主，贵族，资产阶级或是知识分子，都可以利用。艾奇逊在白皮书中再三提到美国在中国的政策是受着两个目的的策励的：“一个目的是在政府能趋于稳定并沿着民主的途径进步的条件下，使中国得到和平；另一个目的是协助国民政府在中国尽可能广大的地区上建立它的权威。”
    就是为了这个“目的”，在蒋介石与美帝国主义靠拢的时候，胡适就出来主张社会要有个“重心”，主张“政治统一”。也就是为了“政府能趋于稳定”这个目的，一九四七年蒋匪政权崩溃前夕，召开臭不堪闻的伪“国大”时，胡适还奉命到南京去大捧其场。正如胡适自己招认：“做了过河卒子，只得拼命向前。”问题还不够清楚吗？胡适正是美帝国主义派过太平洋来的“过河卒子”
    胡适的买办文化的作用是为美帝国主义“征服中国人的心”
    一九三三年二月二十四日胡适答萧伯纳问：“是的，日本决不能用暴力征服中国。日本只有一个法子可以征服中国，这就是悬崖勒马，彻底的停止侵略中国，反过来征服中国民族的心。”（“日本人应该醒醒了”，独立评论四十二期）胡适大概是因为会见了萧伯纳，要显显自己的聪明的头脑的缘故，所以泄露了这个大秘密！日本人自然没有这样聪明，所以只好做些武力侵略的“傻事”。但是却有一个“聪明”的帝国主义，运用了一个“聪明”的奴才，一直在干着“征服中国人的心”的工作，并且这工作做得颇有成绩。这个“聪明”的帝国主义就是美帝国主义。这个“聪明”的奴才就是胡适自己。过去我国一部分知识分子中普遍存在的“亲美、崇美”的反动思想，就是胡适等人“征服中国人的心”的具体成绩。
    胡适熟读讲究封建统治之术的古圣贤书，懂得“攻心”为上的道理，可是他这番本领，也不是道地国货。一九○九年开始，美国退还中国的庚子赔款，以这笔钱吸引中国学生赴美留学，在中国办学校、办医院。为什么这样做？当时美国一个大学校长詹姆士给总统罗斯福的备忘录写得很清楚：
    “那一个国家能做到教育这一代的青年中国人，那一个国家就将由于这方面所支付的努力，而在精神的和商业的影响上，取回最大可能的收获。如果美国在三十年前已经做到把中国学生的潮流引向这一个国家来，并能使这个潮流继续扩大，那么，我们现在一定能够使用最圆满和最巧妙的方式，而控制中国的发展——这就是说，使用那从知识与精神上支配中国的领袖的方式。”
    胡适就是这样一个被美帝国主义培养出来的人物。他在美国的时候已经得到帝国主义重要人物如塔虎脱、杜威等人的青睐。在他们心目中，胡适就是一个理想的“中国的领袖”人物吧！因此胡适从美国回来的时候，就是打算为美帝国主义出卖这一套货物的。三十年的政治活动证明了：胡适就是在文化上、思想上、精神上为美帝国主义“征服中国人的心”，使中国人不但不恨美帝国主义、而且可以甚至愿意接受美帝国主义的侵略。胡适的全部“功绩”就在于此。这也就是“用最完满和最巧妙的方式，而控制中国的发展”。
    胡适在这方面做的“功绩”真是太多了，值得研究帝国主义侵华史的专家去细细搜集，在这篇短文里是说不完的。我们现在只能简单提几点：
    第一，宣传反爱国主义的“世界主义”：
    一九一七年三月七日胡适留学日记“论‘去无道而就有道’”中说，十年之前看到王壬秋的“去无道而就有道”，觉得可耻，而现在，“十年以来，吾之思想亦已变更”（这就是说：已经受了美帝国主义的“教育”了）。“平心而论”，如果自己的国家不好，则投奔别的“好的”国家有什么不可以呢？请看他的论证：
    “若以袁世凯与威尔逊令人择之，则人必择威尔逊，其以威尔逊为异族而择袁世凯者，必中民族主义之毒之愚人也。此即‘去无道而就有道’之意。”胡适就是无耻到这种程度。为什么只能在封建势力的代表者袁世凯和帝国主义的代表者威尔逊两人中选择呢？难道我们就不能在中华民族中找出一个自己的革命的热爱祖国的领袖人物吗？难道中华民族必须要和胡适一道卖祖国、投奔帝国主义吗？
    我们再看在“五四”的十六年之后，胡适是怎样评价“五四”的：
    “‘五四’运动虽然是一个很纯粹的爱国运动，但当时的文艺思想运动却不是狭隘的民族主义运动。蔡元培先生的主张是显然带有‘世界观’的色彩的。……其实孙中山先生也是抱着大同主义的，他是信仰‘天下为公’的理想的。……可是民族主义有三个方面：最浅的是排外，其次是拥护本国的固有文化……”（“个人自由与社会进步”独立评论第一五○号）。看，他是这样无耻地污蔑中国人民反对帝国主义的革命运动是“最浅的排外”，这样无耻的污蔑孙中山先生和蔡元培。买办资产阶级的知识分子的特点，就是根本没有民族立场，不但不反对帝国主义，并且拥护帝国主义的侵略。胡适想将孙中山和蔡元培拉作他自己的“同道”，实在是最无耻的行为。
    也只有胡适这样的洋奴，才能这样下流无耻的来污蔑“五四”运动：
    “况且我们看那几千学生五月四日在美国使馆门口高喊着‘大美国万岁！威尔逊大总统万岁！大中华民国万岁！世界永久和平万岁！’我们不能不承认那引起全世界人类乐观的威尔逊主义在当时确是五四运动的一种原动力。”
      （“纪念‘五四’”，独立评论一四九期）只有在胡适笔下，才会写出这样无耻的文字，也只有在胡适笔下，才会颠倒黑白到将以反对帝国主义为原动力的“五四”运动，说成是以美帝国主义的臭名远扬的“威尔逊主义”为原动力。不要忘记，一九一九年在巴黎和会上正是这个威尔逊在会上支持日本继承在山东的权利的。
    第二，为了宣传他的“世界主义”，他便千方百计来制造种种“美国是中国最好的朋友”的神话。但是侵略中国的帝国主义者无论如何是不会变成中国人民的朋友的，于是他便无耻的搬弄他的主观唯心主义哲学，把白的说成黑的，黑的说成白的，以蒙混中国人民。下面是一个典型的例子。
      “九一八”日本帝国主义强占了我们的东北，原来在中国与日本角逐的美、英帝国主义因为正值自己国内经济恐慌之后，虽想干涉日本企图独占中国的行为，但心有余而力不足，只好眼开眼闭，放任不管。当时的“国际联盟”派了个“李顿调查团”到中国来，得出的结论是由“国联”“共管东北”（实即“瓜分”）。可是日本帝国主义连这意见也不接受，一味向锦州以南进攻。对于这事，英帝国主义索性不问，而美帝国主义由于欧战后十几年来在中国已经有了侵略的基础，不甘心放弃在中国的利益，但又没有更好的办法与日本竞争，便使当时的国务卿史汀生提出一个“不承认主义”（就是实际上让日本占领中国的东北，而口头上采取不承认的办法）。这是帝国主义之间分赃不匀而引起的斗争。可是胡适是怎样的混淆是非呢？
    胡适把“李顿调查团的报告”称作“一个代表世界公论的报告”（应该读作：代表美、英帝国主义者私论的报告）他说：
    “……调查团的建议正是要说：这三省是已经被人家用暴力划出中国范围之外了，现在也许可以用自治省的方式使他们重新回到中国范围之中。”你看，在胡适笔下，“洋大人”真是值得“感激涕零”的“好朋友”了。但是调查团又建议在东北解除中国军队的武装，这怎么解释呢？在胡适看来：“理由很简单，……中国兵不能守土。”（本节引文均见“独立评论”第二十一期）
    可以与他的“国际的中国”同样遗臭万年的是一九三三年发表在“独立评论”第四十五期上的“跋蒋廷黻先生的论文”。他说：
    “十年以来……全国政治势力不用在改造国家的政治，倒用在排外思想的煽动，用在口号标语式的打倒帝国主义。……”接着他对“东方杂志”上所说“帝国主义分割中国之悲喜剧，已经由日内瓦政治外交斗争之场面移转到太平洋武装斗争的场合来了”的话，大表不满：
    “这种议论完全是一串杜撰的名字在那里变戏法，名词的背后若不是恶意的抹煞事实，便是无识的武断。……这种现象真是亡国的现象。”“革命会议以后，在华只图通商的国家切望中国的自强更加热烈，有时比中国人只有过而无不及。在这一点上，这些国家的利益可说是和中国的利益相同的（应该读作：买办者胡适的利益与这些国家的利益是相同的），因为他们知道一个富强的中国必定是他们更大又更有益的市场。”（的确是买办身份，处处不忘市场！）“只有现代化的中国方可根本解决远东问题，国联可以给我们最可靠又最少危险的援助……充分了解这种形势，然后能放手放胆去利用欧美资本与技术合作，来促进中国的现代化。这虽然是迂远的道路，却也许是最快捷的路。”（应读作：快捷的卖国的路）
    我们所以要在这里长篇摘引，不单是为了揭发胡适认贼作父的买办洋奴思想，也是为了让曾经有过崇美、亲美的朋友们“照照镜子”，可以从这里得到教育。让我们一起来与这种最丑恶的思想作坚决的斗争吧！
    第三，胡适为了要给崇美思想奠定基础，就拚命来宣传民族自卑感。
    胡适说：“今日的第一要务是要造一种新的心理：要肯认错，要大彻大悟地承认我们自己百不如人。”（“请大家来照照镜子”）“我们的大病原，依我看来，是我们的老祖宗造孽太深了，祸延到我们今日。”（“惨痛的回忆与反省”）我们要“发下大弘誓来忏悔，来替祖宗忏悔，替我们自己忏悔；要发愿造新因来替代旧日种下的恶因。”（“信心与反省”）
    你们看！这简直是美国派来的大主教在替中国人作祈祷哩！不，正确的说，这是美帝国主义的奴才胡适对中国人民的咬牙切齿的、恶毒的诅咒。不要忘记，胡适这些话都是在“九一八”前后，中华民族解放运动空前高涨的时候写的。在“起来，不愿作奴隶的人们！”歌声高昂的时候，胡适这个披着黑袈裟的魔鬼，就是企图从革命的队伍里拉出一些人来，牵着鼻子领到美帝国主义的教堂里去忏悔自己的“罪恶”。
    当帝国主义者以各种方式加紧对中国侵略的时候，请听胡适是怎样无耻地唱出了他的“帝国主义颂”：
    “我们深深感谢帝国主义者，把我们从这种黑暗的迷梦里警醒起来。我们焚香顶礼感谢基督教的传教士带来了一点点西方新文明……我们十分感谢这班所谓‘文化侵略者’提倡‘天足会’‘不缠足会’，开设新学堂，开设新医院，开设妇婴医院”（“慈幼的问题”）。
    胡适的政治言论是戕害民族自信心的毒菌，是麻醉中国人民的毒药，中国的劳动人民是永远不会相信的。在革命的斗争中，中国人民有着强烈的民族自豪感，有着传统的、战斗的新精神，并且从斗争中团结起来，积一百多年的经验，积几百次大小斗争的经验而取得了今天的胜利。
    简单的结论
    胡适是半封建半殖民地的中国在美国帝国主义所一手造成的买办洋奴，他是彻头彻尾为美帝国主义服务的。胡适的政治主张，实际上只是为美帝国主义侵略中国寻找方便的道路，为美帝国主义侵略中国造成心理基础。这就是他全部反革命活动的社会作用。
    正如郭沫若先生所说“他和蒋介石两人一文一武， 难兄难弟，倒真是有点像‘两峰对峙，双水分流’”。
    胡适这个头等战争罪犯的政治生命虽然早就死亡了，但是他的思想影响却还在我国一部分知识分子中间潜存着，红楼梦研究的讨论只是无数实例中的一个。我们必须坚决地为彻底肃清胡适派的资产阶级唯心论思想而战斗！
