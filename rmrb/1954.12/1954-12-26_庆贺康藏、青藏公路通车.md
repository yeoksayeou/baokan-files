Dalai Lama's Congratulatory Message to the Road Builders

To the commanders, People's Liberation Army road construction troops, and all road construction workers of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways:

Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council of the People's Republic of China, you have waged a tenacious struggle at the risk of your lives on high mountains, rapid rivers, precipitous cliffs, and desolate and frigid grasslands in order to build the Kangzang and Qingzang highways. Now, both highways have been opened to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. This is not only a magnificent and unique pioneering feat unprecedented in thousands of years of history, but also marks the glorious victory of Chairman Mao shining all over Tibet. It will play a significant role in developing and expanding the unity of the Han and Tibetan brothers and sisters, and will also create more favorable conditions for the development of Tibet's economic and cultural construction. I would like to express my highest respect and heartfelt thanks to the great leader Chairman Mao, and congratulate you and express my sincere gratitude from afar in the capital of the motherland, Beijing. In the future, for the sake of Tibet's internal transportation and construction, I hope that you will continue to work hard as before. I wish you good health.

Bainqen Erdini's Congratulatory Message to the Road Builders

To all commanders, soldiers, engineers, and laborers of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highway construction troops:

I am delighted to hear that the Kangzang and Qingzang highways have been officially opened to traffic, and I would like to express my warm congratulations with unparalleled joy.

The construction and official opening of these two highways is the first time in the history of our Tibet. The dangers and difficulties it has experienced are rare not only in China, but also in the world. This can only be achieved under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the beloved leader of the people of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao. The completion of these two highways demonstrates the great strength of the close unity of our people of all ethnic groups. Through these two highways, our Tibetan people will be more united with all brotherly ethnic groups in the country. At the same time, it will provide favorable conditions and increase the confidence of victory for us to build a prosperous and happy life with the support and assistance of all brotherly ethnic groups. Therefore, on the occasion of the official opening, I would like to express my sincere gratitude and congratulations to our admired road construction troops, engineering technicians, and Han and Tibetan laborers.
