    The Excellent Son and Leader of the Czechoslovak People
    ——Congratulations to Comrade Antonín Zápotocký on His Seventieth Birthday
    Wang Xi
    Today, the Chinese people extend our utmost respect and congratulations to Comrade Antonín Zápotocký, President of the Czechoslovak Republic, on his seventieth birthday. Comrade Zápotocký is an outstanding son of the Czechoslovak working people, a famous activist in the workers' movement, and a national leader. He has devoted his life to the cause of liberation for the Czechoslovak people. He has unyieldingly held high the banner of Marxism, day after day, for decades. His history of struggle is the history of the development of the Czechoslovak workers' movement.

    Antonín Zápotocký was born in 1884 in a village near Kladno, a famous mining area in Czechoslovakia. His father, Ladislav Zápotocký, was a garment worker and one of the leaders of the Czech workers' movement in the second half of the 19th century, as well as one of the founders of the first workers' party in Czechoslovakia—the Social Democratic Party.

    Comrade Zápotocký joined the Social Democratic Youth League at the age of sixteen. At that time, he was apprenticed as a stonemason in a mill. The Russian Revolution of 1905 greatly inspired him. Although he was still very young at the time, he understood the significance of this revolution more clearly than most of the leaders of the Social Democratic Party at the time.

    In 1907, he was transferred from his position in the Prague youth movement to Kladno as the secretary of the Social Democratic Party and trade union organizations, which was a major turning point in his life. He worked among miners and steelworkers, striving to consolidate the unity among workers and gaining experience in leading workers' struggles.

    When World War I broke out, the Social Democratic Party, disregarding the interests of the working class, supported the imperialist war; however, Comrade Zápotocký recognized the evil nature of the war and deeply hated it. Because he was conscripted into the army of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he witnessed the disasters that the imperialist war brought to the people, which deepened his understanding of the evils of the capitalist system. When he learned of the victory of the Russian October Revolution on the front lines, he immediately and fully understood the full significance of this great event.

    After the end of World War I, Comrade Zápotocký returned to his homeland. Under the enormous influence of the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, the Czechoslovak people established the Czechoslovak Republic. As the revolutionary forces rose, the leaders of the Social Democratic Party completely betrayed the interests of the working class, implemented a policy of surrendering to the bourgeoisie, and turned around to actively sabotage the revolutionary movement. Comrade Zápotocký understood that it was necessary to learn from the example of the Russian proletariat and strive for the Republic to become a socialist country. Together with comrades such as Šmeral, he organized and led the left wing of the Social Democratic Party, under the leadership of the newly established Communist International, adhering to the struggle against the betrayal activities of the right wing. In 1920, he attended the Second Congress of the Communist International as a representative of the left wing of the Social Democratic Party. At this time, he met Lenin for the first time and visited Soviet Russia for the first time, seeing with his own eyes how the working class was managing its own country. He said: "No matter what, always follow Lenin, follow Soviet Russia, and follow the Communist International."

    His return to his country from Soviet Russia coincided with the entry of Czechoslovakia's domestic political struggle into a decisive stage. At that time, the vast majority of Social Democratic Party members and working people had already risen to support the left wing of the Social Democratic Party, and the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party, who had fallen into the arms of the bourgeoisie, were unprecedentedly isolated. In order to intensify the suppression of the revolutionary movement, the bourgeoisie, with the support of the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party, launched a barbaric attack on the working class in 1920. The Czechoslovak working class held the famous December general strike to counterattack the enemy's offensive. The struggle in the Kladno area, led by Comrade Zápotocký, was the most resolute. However, because the working class did not yet have a revolutionary Marxist party to lead it at that time, the December struggle failed. Czechoslovakia fell into the hands of the bourgeoisie. Comrade Zápotocký was arrested for participating in leading the general strike.

    The Czechoslovak people learned a significant lesson from this failure in the struggle and drew the correct conclusion: without a fighting party of the working class armed with revolutionary theory, the victory of the revolution cannot be achieved. In May 1921, the unified combat headquarters of the working class—the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia—was established. Iron bars did not isolate Comrade Zápotocký from the fiery struggle. Together with other leaders of the workers' movement in prison, he sent a letter from prison to the party's founding congress, demanding that the congress thoroughly accept the twenty-one conditions of the Communist International as the party's guiding principles.

    After being released from prison in 1922, Comrade Zápotocký was elected as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. In 1925, he was first elected as a member of parliament. After 1920, the bourgeoisie did everything in its power to strengthen and consolidate its domestic ruling position, and the struggle of workers to improve their lives was brutally suppressed. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia resolutely defended the interests of the working people and carried out cleaning work within the party, purged the enemies who had infiltrated the party, and replaced the opportunist leadership. A new leadership core, headed by Comrade Gottwald, was established. Comrade Zápotocký, in the struggle to maintain the Bolshevikization of the party, was always one of Comrade Gottwald's most loyal comrades-in-arms. At the Fifth Party Congress held in 1929, Comrade Zápotocký was elected as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. From 1929 to 1939, he served as the General Secretary of the Red Trade Unions. During the world economic crisis that began in 1929, Comrade Zápotocký led many major strikes. In 1932, he and Comrade Gottwald jointly led the famous Most miners' strike.

    When Hitler fascism seized power in Germany and the Czechoslovak people were under serious threat of aggression, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia called for the establishment of a united front against fascism and to defend the interests of the Czechoslovak working people and the nation. Comrade Zápotocký worked even more intensively on the task of unifying the workers' movement. Because he understood that unified trade unions were not only weapons for the working people to fight against capitalists, but also pillars for maintaining national independence and sovereignty. However, the Munich Agreement occurred, and the Czechoslovak bourgeoisie and the international bourgeoisie sold out Czechoslovakia to Hitler, allowing the German fascist aggressors to forcibly occupy the entire territory of Czechoslovakia in 1939.

    In this severe and disastrous era, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was forced to go underground and fight the fascist occupiers. In 1939, Comrade Zápotocký was arrested by the fascist occupiers and suffered torture in Nazi prisons and concentration camps for a full six years. In the concentration camp, he tried his best to influence and help other prisoners with his revolutionary optimism. He told his imprisoned comrades-in-arms about the historical facts of the struggles he had personally experienced, and these memories later developed into the themes of his novels on the workers' movement.

    Comrade Zápotocký was only released from the fascist prison after the Soviet Red Army liberated Czechoslovakia. In June 1945, he was elected as the chairman of the Czechoslovak "Revolutionary Trade Union Movement." Under his leadership, the unified trade union movement became a powerful pillar for the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in its struggle against the bourgeois reactionaries. In February 1948, the bourgeois reactionaries, with the support of foreign imperialism, launched a counter-revolutionary coup in an attempt to restore the capitalist system in Czechoslovakia. At this historically critical moment, the unified trade unions of Czechoslovakia demonstrated a decisive role. Workers and peasants unanimously expressed their support for the Communist Party. Thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and the unity of the working people, the bourgeoisie's delusion that the history of December 1920 could be repeated was completely shattered.

    In the Czechoslovak government established after the victory of the February events, headed by Comrade Gottwald, Comrade Zápotocký served as Deputy Prime Minister. In June 1948, the entire Czechoslovak people unanimously elected Comrade Gottwald as President, and Comrade Zápotocký was appointed as Prime Minister. He diligently and faithfully fulfilled the duties entrusted to him by the Czechoslovak people. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the Czechoslovak people overcame various difficulties in building the cause of socialism and victoriously completed the two-year economic plan and the first five-year plan.

    After Comrade Gottwald's death, the Czechoslovak people unanimously elected Comrade Zápotocký as the President of the Republic.

    捷克斯洛伐克人民的优秀儿子和领导者
    ——祝贺安托宁·萨波托斯基同志七十寿辰
    汪溪
    中国人民今天以极尊敬的心情，祝贺捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统安托宁·萨波托斯基同志的七十寿辰。萨波托斯基同志是捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民的优秀儿子、著名的工人运动活动家、国家领导者。他把毕生精力贡献给为捷克斯洛伐克人民的解放事业。他顽强不屈地高举着马克思主义的旗帜，几十年如一日。他的斗争历史就是捷克斯洛伐克工人运动发展的历史。
    安托宁·萨波托斯基同志，一八八四年生在捷克斯洛伐克的著名矿区克纳德诺附近一个村庄里。他的父亲拉基斯拉夫·萨波托斯基是成衣工人，是十九世纪下半期捷克工人运动的领袖之一，也是捷克斯洛伐克第一个工人政党——社会民主党的奠基人之一。
    萨波托斯基同志十六岁时，参加了社会民主主义青年联盟。那时他在磨坊里学石匠。一九○五年的俄国革命曾给予他很大的鼓舞。虽然那时他还很年轻，可是他甚至比当时社会民主党的大部分领袖，更能清楚地了解这个革命的意义。
    一九○七年他从布拉格青年运动的岗位被调到克纳德诺担任社会民主党和工会组织的书记，这是他生活历史上的重大转折点。他在矿工和钢铁工人间进行工作，极力巩固工人间的团结，取得了领导工人斗争的经验。
    第一次世界大战爆发，社会民主党不顾工人阶级利益，支持帝国主义战争；但萨波托斯基同志认清了战争的罪恶性质，深恨这种战争。因他被征在奥匈帝国的军队服役，他目睹帝国主义战争给人民带来的灾祸，更深刻地认识了资本主义制度的罪恶。当他在火线上得知俄国十月革命胜利的消息时，他立刻充分地理解了这个伟大事变的全部意义。
    第一次世界大战结束后，萨波托斯基同志回到了祖国。在十月社会主义革命胜利的巨大影响下，捷克斯洛伐克人民建立了捷克斯洛伐克共和国。在革命力量日益高涨的情况下，社会民主党的领袖彻底背叛了工人阶级利益，执行了向资产阶级投降的政策，掉转头来积极破坏革命运动。萨波托斯基同志懂得必须学习俄国无产阶级的榜样，争取共和国成为社会主义的国家。他与斯米拉尔等同志一起，组织并领导了社会民主党的左派，在当时新成立的共产国际领导下，坚持了反对右派叛卖活动的斗争。一九二○年，他以社会民主党左派代表的身份出席了共产国际的第二次代表大会，这时，他第一次会见了列宁，并第一次访问了苏维埃俄国，亲眼看到了工人阶级怎样在管理自己的国家，他说：“无论如何，永远跟着列宁走、跟着苏维埃俄国走，跟着共产国际走。”
    他从苏维埃俄国回国，正是捷克斯洛伐克国内的政治斗争进入决定性阶段的时候。当时，绝大多数社会民主党党员和劳动人民都已经起来拥护社会民主党左派，倒向资产阶级怀抱的社会民主党的右翼领袖已空前孤立。资产阶级为了加紧镇压革命运动，在社会民主党右翼领袖的支援下，在一九二○年向工人阶级发动了野蛮的进攻。捷克斯洛伐克的工人阶级举行了有名的十二月总罢工来反击敌人的进攻。萨波托斯基同志所领导的克纳德诺地区的斗争进行得最坚决。但是，由于当时工人阶级还没有一个革命的马克思主义的政党来领导，十二月斗争失败了。捷克斯洛伐克沦入资产阶级的掌握。萨波托斯基同志因为参加领导总罢工而被捕了。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民从这次斗争失败中取得了重大的教训，得出了正确的结论：没有战斗的被革命理论武装起来的工人阶级的政党就不能取得革命的胜利。一九二一年五月，工人阶级的统一的战斗指挥部——捷克斯洛伐克共产党成立了。铁窗并没有把萨波托斯基同志同火热的斗争隔绝，他同狱中的其他工人运动的领导者一起从狱中寄出了一封给党成立大会的信，要求大会彻底地接受共产国际的二十一条纲领作为党的指导原则。
    一九二二年从狱中释放出来以后，萨波托斯基同志被选为捷克斯洛伐克共产党的总书记。一九二五年第一次被选入国会为议员。一九二○年以后，资产阶级竭尽全力来加强和巩固其国内统治的地位，工人谋求改善生活的斗争遭到了残酷镇压。捷克斯洛伐克共产党坚决保卫着劳动人民的利益并在党内进行了清洗工作，肃清了混入党内来的敌人，撤换了机会主义的领导。一个以哥特瓦尔德同志为首的新的领导核心成立了。萨波托斯基同志在维护党的布尔什维克化的斗争中，始终是哥特瓦尔德同志的最忠实的战友之一。在一九二九年召开的第五次党代表大会，萨波托斯基同志当选为捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会委员。从一九二九—一九三九年他担任了红色职工会的总书记。在一九二九年开始的世界经济危机时期，萨波托斯基同志领导了许多次大罢工。一九三二年他与哥特瓦尔德同志一起领导了有名的莫斯特矿工大罢工。
    当希特勒法西斯在德国夺取了政权，捷克斯洛伐克人民受到严重侵略威胁的时候，捷克斯洛伐克共产党号召建立反法西斯及保卫捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民和民族利益的统一战线。萨波托斯基同志更加紧张地从事于统一工人运动的工作。因为他了解到统一的工会不仅是劳动人民与资本家斗争的武器，也是维护国家独立和主权的支柱。但是，慕尼黑事件发生了，捷克斯洛伐克资产阶级和国际资产阶级把捷克斯洛伐克出卖给希特勒，使德国法西斯侵略者在一九三九年强占了捷克斯洛伐克全部领土。
    在这个严重灾难性的年代里，捷克斯洛伐克共产党被迫转入地下和法西斯占领者进行斗争。一九三九年，萨波托斯基同志被法西斯占领者逮捕，在纳粹监狱和集中营里受了整整六年的折磨。在集中营里，他以自己的革命乐观主义竭力影响并帮助其他被囚的人。他向被囚的战斗的伙伴们讲述他自己亲身经历过的斗争的史实，这些回忆后来就发展成为他创作以工人运动为主题的小说的题材。
    苏联红军解放捷克斯洛伐克后，萨波托斯基同志才从法西斯监牢里出来。一九四五年六月，他当选为捷克斯洛伐克“革命工会运动”的主席。统一的工会运动在他领导下，成为捷克斯洛伐克共产党在同资产阶级反动派进行斗争的强大支柱。一九四八年二月，资产阶级反动派在外国帝国主义的支持下，发动了企图使资本主义制度在捷克斯洛伐克复辟的反革命政变。在这历史性的严重关头，捷克斯洛伐克统一的工会显示了决定的作用。工人和农民一致表示拥护共产党。由于有了共产党的领导和劳动人民的团结，资产阶级满以为一九二○年十二月的历史可以重演的迷梦被彻底粉碎了。
    在二月事件胜利以后成立的以哥特瓦尔德同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克政府中，萨波托斯基同志担任了副总理的职务。一九四八年六月，全体捷克斯洛伐克人民一致选举哥特瓦尔德同志为总统，萨波托斯基同志被任命为总理。他勤勉忠实地履行了捷克斯洛伐克人民付托给他的职务。在党和政府的领导下，捷克斯洛伐克人民克服了建设社会主义事业中的种种困难，胜利地完成了两年经济计划和第一个五年计划。
    哥特瓦尔德同志逝世后，捷克斯洛伐克人民一致选举萨波托斯基同志为共和国的总统。
