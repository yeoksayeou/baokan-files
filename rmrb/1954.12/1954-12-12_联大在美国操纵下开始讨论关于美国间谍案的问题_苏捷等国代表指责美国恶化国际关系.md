Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 11th: According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the 8th to discuss the recommendation of the General Committee to include the so-called "accusation of violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement in detaining and imprisoning United Nations military personnel" proposed by the United States in the agenda of the General Assembly.

    The US representative, Lodge, as in the General Committee, tried to portray the convicted American spies as "United Nations military personnel," disregarding the facts, and insisted that their detention was a violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. He remained silent about the facts admitted by the American spies in open court.

    The Soviet representative, Malik, spoke against including this issue on the agenda. He pointed out that the discussion of this issue by the United Nations General Assembly had nothing in common with the purposes and tasks of the United Nations. The United Nations has no right to interfere with a country's exercise of judicial power over spies arrested in its territory.

    Malik also pointed out that the contradictory official statements from the United States regarding the region, purpose, and location where the two downed American planes carrying American spies were shot down, indicate that the claim that these planes were shot down in Korea is completely unconvincing.

    Another important fact that can explain the true intention of the US delegation is that it attempted to separate the eleven spies, including Arnold, from the other two spies, Downey and Fecteau, who were convicted in essentially the same case. Downey and Fecteau were treated as obscure civilians and were not mentioned, while the other eleven spies were portrayed as "military personnel" of the United Nations.

    Malik pointed out that the thirteen American spies fully confessed to their crimes in court. The US delegation cannot provide any convincing arguments to refute these facts and simply denies them arbitrarily.

    Malik said that the US delegation's attempt to force the United Nations General Assembly to discuss this issue is just another attempt to use the United Nations to achieve its own political goals. Everyone knows that at a time when international tensions have somewhat eased, the aggressive groups in certain countries are once again resorting to various means to complicate the international situation. The purpose of the United States in raising the issue of the American espionage case in the United Nations is to create an uproar around this event and unscrupulously slander the People's Republic of China, thereby diverting people's attention from the past and present aggression of the United States against the People's Republic of China in the Far East.

    Malik pointed out that the aggressive actions of the United States near Taiwan and in the seas of China are turning this region into a dangerous source of war because of these aggressive actions. The United States signed a military treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek elements entrenched in Taiwan under the protection of its air and naval forces, further deepening the danger of war in this region. The United Nations should be discussing these issues, not defending spies and saboteurs sent for the sinister purposes of certain people in the United States.

    The British representative, Nutting, supported the US proposal. He was in effect defending the "right" of Western countries to engage in espionage activities at will in the territories of other countries.

    The Czechoslovak representative, Sekaninova, emphasized that the American "accusation" is groundless. She pointed out that the claim on which the American accusation is based has been questioned even in the British Parliament.

    The Polish representative, Skrzeszewski, also opposed including the American "accusation case" on the agenda. He pointed out that the purpose of this "accusation case" is to cause a deterioration in international relations.

    The Canadian representative, Pearson, advocated including the American "accusation case" on the agenda.

    The General Assembly adopted the General Committee's recommendation to include the American "accusation case" on the agenda by a majority vote. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against it. The delegations of India, Indonesia, Burma, and Syria abstained. The General Assembly also adopted a recommendation of the General Committee: to begin discussing this issue immediately in the plenary session of the General Assembly, without waiting for seven days after it was included on the agenda, as stipulated by the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.

    Then, the general debate began. The US representative repeated his untenable argument for the third time. The Colombian representative supported the US "accusation case." The Swedish representative said that the Swedish delegation believes that the procedure used by the US delegation to discuss this issue is incorrect, and he advocated handing over the American "accusation case" to the Korean Military Armistice Commission for handling. However, he immediately said that he would vote in favor of the proposal of the fifteen countries participating in the Korean War, based on the alleged protection of the rights of prisoners of war.

    After the plenary session adjourned, reporters at the United Nations were notified that the US delegation was to withdraw the flight path map of the downed planes it had released and requested that this map not be used as a basis, and announced that another flight path map would be issued tomorrow (obviously, the US delegation believed that it should replace it with a map that was more "close to the truth").

    联大在美国操纵下开始讨论关于美国间谍案的问题
    苏捷等国代表指责美国恶化国际关系
   【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约十日讯：联合国大会八日举行全体会议，讨论总务委员会所提出的关于把美国提出的所谓“控诉违反朝鲜停战协定扣留和囚禁联合国军事人员”问题列入大会议程的建议。
    美国代表洛奇和在总务委员会上一样，不顾事实地企图把被判罪的美国间谍说成是“联合国军事人员”，硬说拘留了他们是破坏了朝鲜停战协定。他闭口不谈美国间谍在公开审判中所供认的事实。
    苏联代表马立克发言反对把这个问题列入议程。他指出，联合国大会讨论这个问题是同联合国的宗旨和任务毫无共同之处的。联合国无权干涉一个国家对在它的领土上逮捕的间谍行使司法权。
    马立克还指出，美国官方声明在谈到被击落的载着美国间谍的两架美国飞机飞行的地区、目的和被击落的地点时，自相矛盾，这说明所谓这些飞机是在朝鲜被击落的说法是完全不足信的。
    能够说明美国代表团的真正意图的另一个重要事实是：它企图把阿诺德等十一名间谍同本质上是在同一桩案件中被判罪的其他两名间谍唐奈和费克图分开，把唐奈和费克图当作是不出名的平民，不提到他们，而把其他十一名间谍粉饰成为联合国的“军事人员”。
    马立克指出，十三个美国间谍在法庭上完全承认了他们的罪行，美国代表团提不出任何有力的论据来驳倒这些事实，只是武断地一口加以否认。
    马立克说，美国代表团企图强使联合国大会讨论这个问题，不过是又一次企图利用联合国来达到自己的政治目的的行动。大家都知道，在国际紧张局势有了某种程度的缓和的时候，某些国家的侵略集团又再一次采取种种办法，企图使国际局势复杂化。美国在联合国提出美国间谍案问题，目的在于围绕这个事件发出一阵喧嚷，大肆诬蔑中华人民共和国，借以转移人们对于美国过去和目前在远东对中华人民共和国的侵略的注意。
    马立克指出，美国在台湾附近和中国海面的侵略行为，由于这些侵略行为，这一地区正在变成危险的战争策源地。美国同在它的海空军庇护下盘踞台湾的蒋介石分子签订了军事条约，更加深了这一地区战争的危险。联合国正是应该讨论这些问题，而不是替为了美国某些人士的罪恶目的而派遣的间谍和破坏分子辩护。
    英国代表纳丁支持美国的建议，他实际上就是在捍卫西方国家在其他国家领土上随心所欲地从事间谍活动的“权利”。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表塞卡尼诺娃着重说，美国的“控诉”是没有任何根据的。她指出，美国的控诉所根据的说法，甚至在英国议会中也受到了怀疑。
    波兰代表斯克热歇夫斯基也反对把美国的“控诉案”列入议程。他指出，这个“控诉案”的目的是要引起国际关系的恶化。
    加拿大代表皮尔逊主张把美国的“控诉案”列入议程。
    大会以多数票通过总务委员会的关于把美国“控诉案”列入大会议程的建议。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克的代表团投票反对。印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、叙利亚的代表团弃权。大会还通过了总务委员会的一项建议：立即开始在大会全体会议上讨论这个问题，不必依照大会议事规则的规定，等到在它被列入议程七天后再来讨论。
    接着，开始一般性辩论。美国代表第三次重复了他的站不住脚的论调。哥伦比亚代表支持美国的“控诉案”。瑞典代表说，瑞典代表团认为美国代表团用来讨论这个问题的程序是不对的，他主张把美国的“控诉案”交给朝鲜军事停战委员会处理。但是他立刻就说，他将投票赞成参加朝鲜战争的十五国的提案，其根据据说是为了保卫战俘的权利。
    全体会议休会后，在联合国的记者们得到通知，美国代表团要收回它所发布的被击落的飞机的航线图，并且请求不要以这张图作根据，同时宣布明天将换发另外一张航线图（显然，美国代表团认为应当换一张更“近乎真实”的图）。
