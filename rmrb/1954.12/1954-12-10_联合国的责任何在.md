The United States, on the 7th, gathered fifteen countries that participated in the aggression against Korea and submitted a proposal to the United Nations General Assembly, falsely accusing the Chinese government of violating the Korean Armistice Agreement by sentencing eleven American spies, and demanded that the United Nations step in to secure their release. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles also made a statement on the same day, demanding that the United Nations take responsibility for securing the release of these American spies. This shows that the United States is attempting to once again use the United Nations to cover up its aggressive actions and interfere in China's internal affairs.

What reason does the United States have to demand that the United Nations secure the release of these eleven American spies?

The Chinese authorities possess a large amount of evidence proving that these eleven Americans were American spies who infiltrated China by plane to scout our national defense facilities. They are not prisoners of war captured while fighting in Korea during the Korean War, because they were clearly captured on Chinese territory, not in Korea, because they are spies of the American Central Intelligence Agency who sneaked into Chinese airspace to conduct espionage activities. They are part of those American spies who, as "New York Times" military commentator Baldwin said in an article entitled "The Price of Survival" on September 14, frequently sneak into other countries' borders by plane.

The Chinese government arrested American spies who infiltrated our territory on its own territory and punished them in accordance with our national laws. This is an exercise of its national sovereignty and has nothing to do with the Korean Armistice Agreement. In fact, it is not China that has violated the Korean Armistice Agreement and forcibly detained prisoners of war, but the United States itself. During the Korean War, the United States colluded with the Syngman Rhee clique and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to forcibly detain more than 48,000 captured personnel from Korea and China, and the United States has not yet accounted for the whereabouts of these people.

In this situation, what is the responsibility of the United Nations?

The United Nations' inescapable responsibility lies in severely condemning the United States' act of sending spies to sneak into China, and it should never cover up the United States' aggressive acts, violate the United Nations Charter, and interfere in China's internal affairs.

The United Nations' inescapable responsibility also lies in demanding that the United States implement the Korean Armistice Agreement and return the more than 48,000 captured personnel from Korea and China that it forcibly detained, and it should never condone the United States' violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and serve the United States' plot to obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Many reports from Washington indicate that the U.S. authorities, while concluding the so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, are loudly publicizing the American spy case to the United Nations, with the aim of diverting world public opinion and covering up the United States' aggression against China. At the same time, it is even more noteworthy that the American warmongers are also attempting to use the American spy case to create tensions in order to expand aggression against China in the name of the United Nations. Recently, some people in Washington have been constantly clamoring for a naval blockade and intensified embargo against China.

Needless to say, any intimidation or threats will never shake the Chinese people's will to oppose American aggression, nor will it change the ironclad fact that American spies sneaked into Chinese airspace to carry out criminal activities. The question now is: if the United Nations does not learn the lessons of the Korean War, and once again succumbs to the pressure of the United States, covering up its espionage crimes for the United States, then the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter will be violated again, and the prestige of the United Nations will be damaged again, and reduced to an instrument of American aggression. The United Nations' major responsibility at present is to uphold the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and refuse to serve the United States' aggressive policy, rather than allow the United States to manipulate it to interfere in China's internal affairs.

    联合国的责任何在
    新华社评论员  江南
    美国在七日纠集侵略朝鲜的十五个国家向联合国大会提出建议，诬蔑中国政府判处十一名美国间谍所谓是违反朝鲜停战协定的，要求联合国出面使他们得到释放。美国国务卿杜勒斯并在同一天发表谈话，要求联合国负起使这些美国间谍得到释放的责任。这就表明，美国企图再度利用联合国来掩饰自己的侵略行为并干涉中国的内政。
    美国有什么理由要求联合国来使这十一名美国间谍得到释放呢？
    中国当局掌握有大量的人证物证，证明这十一名美国人都是乘用飞机偷入中国来侦察我国国防设施的美国间谍。他们并不是什么朝鲜战争中在朝鲜作战被俘的战俘，因为他们明明白白是在中国领土上而不是在朝鲜被俘的，因为他们是偷入中国领空进行间谍活动的美国中央情报局的间谍。他们就是“纽约时报”军事评论员鲍德温在九月十四日的一篇以“幸存的代价”为题的文章中所说的那些经常乘飞机偷入别国国境的美国间谍的一部分。
    中国政府在自己的领土上逮捕潜入我国境内的美国间谍，并且依照我国的国家法律予以惩办，这是行使自己的国家主权，与朝鲜停战协定没有任何关系。事实上，违反朝鲜停战协定，强迫扣留战俘的并不是中国，而是美国自己。美国在朝鲜战争中勾结李承晚集团和蒋介石卖国集团强迫扣留了四万八千多名朝中被俘人员，对于这些人的下落，美国一直到现在没有作出任何交代。
    在这种情况下，联合国的责任何在呢？
    联合国的不可逃避的责任在于严厉谴责美国派遣间谍偷入中国的侵略行为，而绝不应该为美国的侵略行为掩饰，违反联合国宪章，干涉中国的内政。
    联合国的不可逃避的责任还在于要求美国执行朝鲜停战协定，交还它所强迫扣留的四万八千多名朝中被俘人员，而绝不应该纵容美国这种违反朝鲜停战协定的行为，为美国阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的阴谋服务。
    来自华盛顿的许多消息表明，美国当局在和蒋介石卖国集团订立所谓“共同防御条约”的同时，竟大吹大擂向联合国提出美国间谍案，其目的是转移世界舆论的视线，掩饰美国对中国的侵略。同时，更值得指出的是，美国好战分子还企图利用美国间谍案来制造紧张局势，以便假联合国之名扩大对中国的侵略。近来华盛顿方面就有些人不断叫嚣什么对中国实行海军封锁和加紧禁运。
    用不着说，任何恫吓、威胁绝不能动摇中国人民反对美国侵略行为的意志，也改变不了美国间谍偷入中国领空进行罪恶活动的铁的事实。现在的问题倒是：如果联合国不记取朝鲜战争的教训，再次屈从于美国的压力，为美国掩饰它的间谍罪行，那么联合国宪章的宗旨和原则将再度遭到破坏，联合国的威信将再度受到损害，而降为美国的侵略工具。联合国当前的重大责任是维护联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，拒绝为美国的侵略政策服务，而不是听任美国操纵来干涉中国的内政。
