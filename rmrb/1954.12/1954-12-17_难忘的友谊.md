Unforgettable Friendship
By Our Correspondent Yuan Liang

"Who is sincerely and selflessly assisting our country in building its first oil base?" "And who is tirelessly helping our country find new oil fields?" If you ask any employee of Yumen Oil Mine, even the children in the elementary school for the employees' children, they will eagerly answer you: It is our great ally, the Soviet Union; it is the governments and people of our brotherly countries Romania, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia.

The assistance of Soviet experts to Yumen Oil Mine over the past few years has encompassed all the basic aspects of oil industrial production and construction. They have helped us establish a huge geophysical exploration force from small to large, including a complete set of seismic, gravity, surface electrical exploration, and downhole electrical logging; they have taught us advanced experience in rapid drilling, drilling deep wells, and winter drilling; they have helped us establish scientific development plans for existing oil fields, rational mining methods, and a complete set of oil well management systems; they have especially made us pay attention to how to identify oilfield drive types, adapt to oilfield properties, and use artificial forces (such as water injection and gas injection) to seize treasures from nature.

Downhole electrical logging is the eye of petroleum geological work. It can tell you the conditions of the formations, oil, gas, and water hundreds or thousands of meters deep underground that you cannot see with your naked eye. Historically, China had suffered a lot in drilling work because it did not have electrical logging equipment. It often happened that oil (gas) layers were penetrated without being discovered. Now, our blood-related and intimate friend, the Soviet Union, has not only satisfied our requirements for electrical logging instruments, but also sent excellent experts, Comrades Moseev and Andreiko, to personally help us train people who master this advanced instrument, taught us how to interpret electrical logging, and helped us establish a complete set of work systems, working methods, and operating procedures. Now, China's downhole electrical logging team has grown more than twenty times since the early days of liberation, and it has taken on the task of downhole electrical logging in new petroleum exploration areas. Under the inspiration and encouragement of Soviet experts, Liu Yongnian and other Chinese electrical logging engineers further studied the advanced Soviet experience, resulting in creative improvements to downhole electrical logging instruments.

Similar to the development process of downhole electrical logging, Soviet experts have helped us establish and train a large-scale surface geophysical exploration team with independent working capabilities in seismic, gravity, and other methods, and have helped us determine exploration directions and operating procedures, creating a material foundation for our work in extensively searching for new oil fields.

The internationalist spirit of Soviet experts who love their work and are tireless is forever our example. Let us talk about some trivial things about Comrade Moseev, who is most familiar to Chinese petroleum workers.

Moseev is an excellent Soviet geologist and engineer. When he first arrived in China, he was very strong, and no Chinese geological personnel could keep up with him when he climbed mountains and ridges. However, because he was a diligent and selfless person, and also due to an irregular long-term field life, his stomach problems recurred. The condition was very serious and he underwent major surgery. But when his body had not fully recovered, he disregarded everyone's advice and endured personal physiological pain to go to the field. On the long journey, his physical condition forced him to lie down by the roadside to get a short rest during every gap when the car stopped. But when he entered the site, that heavy drowsiness was thrown behind him again. Back in the room, he still worked as usual. In order to complete a work task, he often stayed up late into the night. He said: "How long can I stay in China? Wasting one minute is a loss of one minute." In this way, he dedicated all his energy to the Chinese people.

Similarly, no one will forget the countless efforts and the huge role played by other brotherly countries in helping the construction of China's oil base. Romania is a country with a developed petroleum industry in the world, and it has a history of more than one hundred years of oil extraction. In order to help China's petroleum industrial construction, the Romanian government has transported many new drilling rigs to our country, and has also sent a drilling team headed by engineer Moisey to work with Chinese workers to start drilling the "Friendship Well" to impart experience in drilling deep wells. Engineer Moisey is not only directly responsible for all technical guidance work for the "Friendship Well", but also often travels to other well sites to assist in solving technical problems. In particular, when stuck pipe accidents occur on other wells, he will be invited to rescue them like a famous doctor. His contribution is significant. For example, there was a well that had a stuck pipe accident and drilling was stopped for more than two months without being resolved. However, under the personal guidance of Engineer Moisey, after a series of technical measures and the use of the advanced "oil soaking" method, the drill pipe was restarted in just three days. In the installation of derrick and drilling rig power - giant diesel engines, Chinese drilling workers and technicians have also learned advanced experience, so that the installation quality has reached solid, accurate, and rapid, creating a guarantee for rapid drilling. Recently, they have also learned the advanced method of "overall derrick movement." In this way, under appropriate terrain conditions, the iron tower-like, towering derrick can be completely moved to a new well site. The convergence of Romania's specific experience in drilling with the Soviet Union's advanced experience has further enriched our drilling knowledge.

The Romanian Party and government once instructed the drilling team:
"We must use all our strength to support China's petroleum industrial construction." The drilling team faithfully fulfilled this instruction. Like Captain Burdan, no matter what time or under any harsh weather conditions, wherever he was needed, he would go there at all costs. He had many times walked to the well site one kilometer away in wind, snow, rain, and pitch-black nights to solve important problems there. In September, the intermediate casing was to be run on the well, which was an important job. Captain Burdan personally operated on the well, working continuously for more than forty hours, sacrificing his sleep. All the comrades of the Romanian drilling team worked hard in our country for more than ten months with such a spirit. And will continue to spend the cold winter in the Gobi Desert.

The crude oil eastward transportation work is of great significance in China's petroleum industrial construction. When talking about crude oil eastward transportation, people will naturally think of the great assistance of the governments and people of the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic to us. Those behemoth-like heavy diesel vehicles speeding across the Gobi Desert were made by the workers of these brotherly countries. They have many advantages, but because our technical level is low, we cannot control them well. In the initial period of use, there was a serious situation where more than 50% of the vehicles were damaged and stopped running, affecting the completion of transportation tasks. Under this urgent situation, experts from the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic came to Yumen Oil Mine. German Democratic Republic experts Gromann and Glaubler have rich driving and repair experience. They discovered the basic weakness that we did not understand the characteristics of diesel vehicles. Based on this weakness, they explained in detail the structure and performance of the "IFA" car, and helped us train drivers, establish a maintenance system, and formulate formal operating procedures, reversing the past chaotic situation and increasing the vehicle turnover rate to 80%. Czechoslovak experts Sannek and Drushi helped us establish a vehicle maintenance plant, consolidated and enriched the maintenance system, and solved many key production problems. For example, at that time, there were no imports from abroad and domestic production of the extremely important parts on the car such as "high-pressure pumps" and "fuel injectors", and the damage situation was very serious, which would cause the vehicles to stop running. While we were at a loss, experts promptly taught Chinese workers the precise high-pressure pump calibration and fuel injector grinding technology, maintained driving, and ensured the completion of production tasks.

In order to truly understand road conditions and climate conditions, they more effectively helped us train drivers. They personally drove a Czech-made "Tatra" ten-ton truck and led a Chinese convoy on the 600-kilometer highway from Jiuquan to Dachaidan, making a driving demonstration, and combined the problems found in daily driving, tirelessly imparted driving and maintenance knowledge to all employees at the parking station, improving the technical level of the employees. Now, the governments and people of Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic have sent a second group of excellent experts. They will also make new contributions in helping China's petroleum transportation work.

    难忘的友谊

    “是谁在真挚无私的援助我国建设第一个石油基地？”“又是谁在不辞辛劳地帮助我国寻找新的油田？”假如你这样地问玉门油矿的每一个职工，甚至职工子弟小学的孩子们，他们都会争先向你回答：是我们的伟大盟邦苏联；是我们的兄弟国家罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的政府和人民。
    苏联专家们几年来对玉门油矿工作的援助，包括了石油工业生产建设的一切基本方面，他们帮助我们从小到大地建立了巨大的地震、重力、地面电法探勘、井下电测等全套的地球物理勘探力量；传授给我们快速钻井，打深井以及冬季钻井的先进经验；帮助我们确立了现有油田的科学开发方案，合理开采方法，和油井的整套管理制度；特别使我们注意了如何去识别油田驱动类型，适应油田性质，用人工力量（如注水注气等），向大自然夺取宝藏。
    井下电测工作，是石油地质工作的眼睛，它可以告诉你，在你肉眼看不到的几百、几千公尺深的井下的地层和油、气、水的情况。历史上，我国因为没有电测设备，钻井工作曾吃过不少苦头。往往已经穿过了油（气）层而又发现不了它。现在，我们血肉般亲密的朋友——苏联，不仅满足了我们对电测仪器的要求，而且还派了优秀的专家莫谢耶夫和安德列柯等同志，亲手帮助我们培养了掌握这种高级仪器的人，教给了我们怎样进行电测解释工作，帮助我们建立了整套的工作制度，工作方法和操作规程。现在，我国的井下电测队伍，已较解放初期增长了二十倍以上。肩负起了新的石油探区的井下电测任务。在苏联专家的启发与鼓励下，我国电测工程人员刘永年等进一步钻研苏联先进经验的结果，使井下电测仪器有了创造性的改进。
    和井下电测工作的发展过程相似，苏联专家们一手帮助我们建立并培养了庞大的地震、重力等具有独立工作能力的地面地球物理勘探队伍，并帮助我们确定了探勘方向和操作规程，为我们广泛探寻新油田的工作创造了物质基础。
    苏联专家们那种热爱工作忘我不倦的国际主义精神，永远是我们的榜样。让我们谈一谈我国石油工作者最熟悉的莫谢耶夫同志的一些小事罢。
    莫谢耶夫，是苏联优秀的地质师和工程师。他刚到我国时，身体很壮硕，翻山越岭，中国的地质人员们谁也赶不上他。可是因为他是一个勤劳忘我的人，又加上不规律的长期野外生活，使他的胃病复发了。病情十分严重，动了大手术。但当他的身体还没有完全复原时，他又不顾任何人的劝阻，忍受着个人生理上的痛苦，到野外去。在漫长的旅途中，身体条件迫使他不得不借着汽车中途停驶的每
  一个间隙，躺在路旁获取短暂的歇息。但当他一进入现场后，那种沉重的困倦，又被他抛到脑后了。回到了室内，他仍然和平常一样地工作着。为了完成一种工作任务，往往到了深夜不肯入眠。他说：“我在中国能呆多长时间呢？空度一分钟，就是一分钟的损失。”他就是这样，把他的全副精力贡献给中国人民。
    同样，谁也不会忘记：别的兄弟国家在帮助我国石油基地建设中所付出的无数心血和所发挥的巨大作用。罗马尼亚，是世界上石油工业发达的国家，她有着一百多年石油开采的历史。为着帮助我国的石油工业建设，罗马尼亚政府，给我国输送了很多新式钻机，还派来了以莫依赛工程师为首的钻井工作队，和我国工人合力开钻了“友谊之井”，以传授钻凿深井的经验。莫依赛工程师不仅直接负责着“友谊之井”的一切技术指导工作，而且还经常奔波在别的井场上，去协助解决技术方面的问题。特别是其他井上发生卡钻事故时，他便会被当作名医一样请去救援。他的贡献是重大的。例如，曾经有一口井，发生卡钻事故，停钻两个多月未能解除。但在莫依赛工程师亲自指导下，经过一系列的技术措施，采用“泡油”的先进方法，仅用了三天的工夫便使钻杆重新转动起来。在井架和钻机动力——巨型柴油机安装方面，我国的钻井工人和技术人员，也学得了先进经验，使安装质量达到坚固、准确、迅速，为快速钻井创造了保证条件。最近，他们又学习了“井架整体移动”的先进方法。这样，便可以在适当地形条件下，把那铁塔般的、高耸天际的井架，完整地移向新的井场。罗马尼亚钻井方面的具体经验与苏联先进经验的交汇，更丰富了我们的钻井知识。
      罗马尼亚的党和政府，曾嘱托钻井工作队：
  “要用尽一切力量，支援中国的石油工业建设。”钻井工作队忠实地履行了这一指示。像布尔丹队长，不管在任何时候、任何恶劣的气候条件下，哪里需要他，他就会不顾一切地到哪里去。他曾经很多次在风雪、阴雨、漆黑的夜里，徒步到一公里外的井场上去，解决那里的重要问题。九月间，井上要下中层套管，这是件重要的工作，布尔丹队长亲自在井上操作，连续忙碌了四十多个小时，牺牲了自己的睡眠。罗马尼亚钻井队的全体同志，就是以这样的精神，在我国紧张地工作了十个来月。并将继续在戈壁滩上度过严寒的冬天。
      原油东运工作，在我国石油工业建设中是具有重大意义的，谈到原油东运，就会很自然地联想到德意志民主共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和人民对我们的巨大援助。那巨兽般飞驰在戈壁滩上的各种重型柴油车，是这些兄弟国家的工人亲手制造的，它有着很多优点，但我们因为技术水平低，不能很好驾御，在最初使用期间，曾出现了车子受损停驶百分之五十以上的严重局面，影响了运输任务的完成。正在这种紧迫的情况下，德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的专家们，来到了玉门油矿。德意志民主共和国专家格罗曼和葛劳勃勒，有着丰富的驾驶和修理经验，他们发现了我们不了解柴油车特性的基本弱点，就针对这一弱点，详细讲解了
  “依法”车的构造和性能，并帮助我们训练了司机，建立了保养制度，制定了正规的操作规程，扭转了过去的混乱局面，使车辆周转率提高到百分之八十。捷克斯洛伐克专家桑乃克和德鲁希则帮助我们建立了车辆保养厂，巩固并充实了保养制度，解决了很多生产上的关键问题。比如，当时国外没有进货，国内不会制造的“高压泵”、“喷油嘴”等车子上的极重要零件，损坏情况很严重，将要造成车辆停驶。我们正在手足无措时，专家及时教给了我国工人精细的高压泵校正、喷油嘴磨研技术，维护了行驶，保证了生产任务的完成。
    为了切实了解路况和气候条件，他们更有效地帮助我们训练驾驶人员，他们亲自驾着捷产“泰拖拉”十吨车，带领我国一个车队，在酒泉到打柴沟六百多公里的公路线上，作了驾驶示范，并且结合每天行驶中所发现的问题，向停车站所有的职工，不倦地传授驾驶和保养知识，提高了职工们的技术水平。现在，捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国的政府和人民，又派来了第二批优秀的专家。他们又将在帮助我国的石油运输工作中，作出新的贡献。
