    Hebei Province Completes Dike Repair Project
    The dike repair project in Hebei Province has been fully completed. The province's main projects this year were the repair of dikes along the South Grand Canal, Ziya River, North Grand Canal, Yongding River, Daqing River, Hutuo River, and Chaobai River, with a planned earthwork volume of over 3.7 million cubic meters. As of recently, the province has completed 97% of the entire project. The remaining work has been suspended due to rain and snow and will be completed next spring. More than thirty counties in the province had construction tasks, mobilizing over 110,000 civilian laborers. According to inspections, the project quality is generally good. While repairing the dikes, local governments along the dikes have paid close attention to mobilizing the masses to plant trees on the dikes. Currently, 1,637,000 trees have been planted, which will greatly contribute to consolidating the dikes. To ensure the survival rate, each county in the Cangxian Special District has consulted with the agricultural production cooperatives in the villages along the river, with the agricultural production cooperatives responsible for inspections and replanting of trees that do not survive. Before the ground froze, many counties also organized dike patrol personnel to thicken the soil around the tree roots, making it easier for the trees to survive.

    河北省修复堤防工程结束
    河北省堤防修复工程已全部结束。全省今年的主要工程是修复南运河、子牙河、北运河、永定河、大清河、滹沱河、潮白河等的堤防，计划工程的土方为三百七十多万公方。截至最近，全省已完成全部工程的百分之九十七，其余工程，因雨雪停工，将于明春完成。全省有施工任务的达三十多个县，动员民工十一万余人。据检查，工程质量一般良好。在修复堤防同时，沿堤各地政府都十分注意发动群众在堤防上植树，现已栽植一百六十三万七千棵树，这对巩固堤防将有很大作用。为了保证成活率，沧县专区各县并已和沿河各村的农业生产合作社商定，由农业生产合作社负责检查，并对不能成活的树进行补栽。许多县在封冻前还组织了巡堤员，培厚树根土，使树木容易成活。
