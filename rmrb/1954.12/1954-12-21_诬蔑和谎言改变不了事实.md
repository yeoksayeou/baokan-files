Slander and Lies Cannot Change the Facts
Tan Wenrui

The United States recently used the United Nations as a platform for slander, wantonly vilifying the People's Republic of China for implementing so-called "forced labor," and manipulated the United Nations General Assembly to pass an absurd resolution that was clearly intended to defame the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other People's Democratic countries. However, it is well known that isn't it precisely the American bourgeoisie and their agents, who enrich themselves by exploiting the blood and sweat of the vast American working people and colonial peoples, who are implementing a system of forced labor!

For a long time, American propaganda organs have continuously slandered the People's Republic of China for the existence of a so-called "slave labor system," but they can only rely on fabricated lies to carry out their vilification. For example, American rumor-mongering experts have argued sophistically that the Chinese people's high enthusiasm for labor in production and construction and their opposition to undermining labor discipline are evidence of "forced labor." This can only prove the shamelessness of the liars. Wu Nu, the Prime Minister of Burma, who had just visited China, said in a radio address on December 10th, when talking about the prominent characteristics he saw in New China: "I saw everywhere that the Chinese people were fulfilling their responsibilities in a spirit of freedom," "I felt that the Chinese people were carrying out the tasks assigned to them with enthusiasm and determination." Mrs. Pandit, the former head of the Indian delegation to the United Nations, who came to China in 1952, also issued a special statement refuting the rumors in American newspapers, saying: "Some statements say that people were conscripted for 'forced labor' to build the Huai River dam. As far as we know, there was no 'forced labor.' It is well known that the Huai River dam was built with the voluntary cooperation of about two million farmers."

Recently, the American political swindlers in the United Nations have tirelessly repeated the kind of slander that has already gone bankrupt. They obviously believe in Goebbels' dogma: "A lie repeated often enough becomes the truth." This time, they seized on the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Labor Reform promulgated by the People's Republic of China government not long ago as the "argument" for their slander.

It is well known that Article 1 of the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Labor Reform" states that this is a law to punish and reform counter-revolutionary criminals and other criminals, and its purpose is to enable counter-revolutionary criminals and other criminals to "transform themselves in labor and become new people." That is to say, to enable criminals to develop labor habits and learn productive skills so that they can seek legitimate ways of life through their own labor in the new society after their sentences are served and no longer commit crimes. This is the correct way to eliminate criminal behavior, and it is also entirely in line with humanitarian principles and the interests of the prisoners themselves. Many people from capitalist countries have come to China to visit our labor reform institutions and have expressed satisfaction with our work in reforming criminals. For example, Kenji Asakawa, director of the Japan China Research Institute, published an article in the "Human Rights Minpo" in Tokyo on July 25th this year, recounting his impressions of visiting prisons in China. He praised our policy of reforming criminals through labor, saying: "What surprised me was that high-level technology was taught to criminals in prison. In this way, while reforming their thinking, the criminals established a foundation for living strongly in the new society." He also said: "Rather than saying this is a prison, it is closer to the truth to say it is a school for reforming people." No country has been criticized for supervising criminals to engage in legitimate productive labor. Our measures for reforming criminals are reasonable and well-founded. It has nothing in common with so-called forced labor. However, American diplomats, whose profession is to spread rumors, attempt to confuse the public and stubbornly insist that our judicial measures to punish and reform a small number of criminals are evidence of "slave labor" carried out for political and economic purposes. This is clearly not because they are ignorant, but because they intend to slander us.

However, the people of the world are not easily deceived. They know clearly that the real forced labor system exists precisely in the United States. The United Nations "Ad Hoc Committee on Forced Labour" also acknowledged in a report it issued on June 22, 1953 (a report whose purpose was originally to slander the Soviet Union) that the essence of forced labor is mainly determined by such an economic system: that is, workers are deprived of the means of production and production tools, enslaved by the owners of the means of production, and do not enjoy the fruits of their labor. The United States' corrupt capitalist economic system is precisely such an economic system. There, in order to extract maximum profits, monopoly capital carries out barbaric exploitation of workers and creates massive unemployment in order to force workers to sell their labor cheaply, in effect turning wage labor into servile labor. The American ruling group has intensified the formulation of various reactionary anti-labor laws, even openly depriving the working people of the right to strike and restricting their right to enter into collective contracts, thus turning the entire country into a forced labor prison for the working people. Slave labor, which is carried out openly under government protection, is also very common in the United States. American journalist and writer Stetson Kennedy submitted an investigation report to the United Nations "Ad Hoc Committee on Forced Labour," which was based on reliable materials he had collected over more than ten years (including official American figures and figures revealed in newspapers). In the report, he revealed that in some states in the eastern and southern United States, there were more than five million people of various races living like slaves. He had personally witnessed people being sold like livestock and performing inhuman labor under whips while wearing chains. A report by the American "Workers Defense League" also admitted that there are seven forms of forced labor in the United States, including: debt peonage, exploitation of illegal immigrants, forced labor of the mentally ill, wartime exploitation of foreigners, exploitation of Indians, and forced labor under the Taft-Hartley Act. As for the cruel forced labor imposed on prisoners in American prisons, that is even more of an open secret. The American government even rents out prison factories and plantations to capitalists, allowing them to reap huge profits from the forced labor of prisoners. In recent years, the United States has been frantically expanding its armaments, and has coordinated prison production with war plans. "Turning factories into dark prisons, turning prisons into forced labor factories," this is the portrayal of forced labor in the United States.

The United States' slanderous propaganda in the United Nations cannot cover up the truth. The United States' clamoring about the existence of "forced labor" in the People's Republic of China is just part of a large-scale slander campaign it has recently launched against our country. Its purpose is obviously to divert people's attention from the American conspiracy to expand its policy of aggression against China.

    诬蔑和谎言改变不了事实
    谭文瑞
    美国最近利用联合国作为诽谤的讲坛，肆意诬蔑中华人民共和国实行所谓“强迫劳动”，并且操纵联合国大会通过了一个显然是诋毁苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的荒谬决议。但是，人所共知，实行强迫劳动制度的难道不正是那些以剥削美国广大劳动人民和殖民地人民血汗以自肥的美国资产阶级及其代理人吗！
    长久以来，美国宣传机关就不断地诽谤中华人民共和国存在着所谓“奴役劳动制度”，但是它们只能依靠凭空捏造来进行诬蔑。例如：美国造谣专家们曾强词夺理地说中国人民在生产建设中表现高度的劳动热情和反对败坏劳动纪律就是“强迫劳动”的证据。这只能证明撒谎者的无耻。刚访问过中国的缅甸总理吴努在十二月十日的广播演说中谈到他在新中国看到的显著特点时就说：“我在到处都看到中国人民在以自由的精神履行他们的责任”，“我感觉到中国人民都怀着热情和决心来执行交给他们的任务”。在一九五二年来到中国的前印度驻联合国代表团团长潘迪特夫人并曾经特别发表声明驳斥美国报纸的造谣，她说：“有些声明说老百姓被征去进行‘强迫劳动’，建筑淮河水闸。就我们所知，没有‘强迫劳动’的事。大家知道得很清楚，淮河水闸是在两百万左右农民自愿合作下筑成的”。
    最近，在联合国中的美国政治骗子又不厌其烦地重复那种已经破产的诽谤，他们显然信奉戈培尔的教条：“谎言的多次重复便能使人相信”。这一回，他们抓住中华人民共和国政府不久以前颁布的劳动改造条例作为他们进行诽谤的“论据”。
    人所共知，“中华人民共和国劳动改造条例”第一条就说明了这是一项对反革命犯和其他罪犯实施惩罚和改造的法律，它的目的是使反革命犯和其他刑事犯“在劳动中改造自己，成为新人”。这也就是说，使犯了罪的人养成劳动习惯并学会生产技能，以便刑满获释后能够在新社会中通过自己的劳动去谋求正当的生活出路而不再犯罪。这是消灭犯罪行为的正确途径，也是完全合乎人道原则和犯人本身利益的。许多资本主义国家的人士到中国来参观过我国劳动改造机关后，都对我国劳动改造罪犯的工作表示满意。例如日本中国研究所理事浅川谦次在今年七月二十五日东京的“人权民报”上曾发表文章，追述他在中国参观监狱的观感，他赞扬我国劳动改造罪犯的政策说：“使我惊讶的是，在监狱中对罪犯传授高度的技术。这样，在思想改造的同时，就使罪犯们建立了能够在新社会中坚强生活的基础。”他并且说：“与其说这是一个监狱，不如说是一个改造人的学校更近乎实情。”没有一个国家因为督导罪犯从事正当的生产劳动而被非议。我国对罪犯的改造措施是合情合理的。它与所谓强迫劳动毫无共同之处。但是以造谣为业的美国外交家却企图混淆视听，把我国惩罚和改造少数犯罪者的司法措施，硬说成是为政治和经济目的而实行的“奴役劳动”的证据，这显然不是因为他们愚昧无知而是因为他们存心诬蔑。
      但是世界各国人民并不是容易欺骗的。他们清楚地知道，真正的强迫劳动制度正是存在于美国。联合国的“强迫劳动专设委员会”在它于一九五三年六月二十二日发表的一份报告（这份报告的目的原是想诬蔑苏联的）也承认，强迫劳动的本质主要是由这样的经济制度决定的：即工人被剥夺了生产工具和生产手段，被生产手段所有者所奴役，并不享受他劳动的成果。美国的腐朽的资本主义经济制度正是这样的一种经济制度。在那里，垄断资本为了榨取最大限度的利润，对工人实行着野蛮的剥削，并制造了大量的失业，以迫使劳动者廉价出卖他们的劳动，事实上已把工资劳动变成为奴役性劳动。美国统治集团并变本加厉地制定了各种反动的反劳工法，甚至公开剥夺了劳动人民罢工的权利和限制他们订立集体合同的权利，因而把全国变成了劳动人民的苦工监狱。在政府庇护下明目张胆进行的奴役劳动在美国也是极普遍的。美国记者和作家斯特森·肯尼地曾向联合国“强迫劳动专设委员会”提出过一份调查报告，那是根据他十多年来所收集的确实材料（包括美国官方的和报刊上透露的数字）而写成的，他在报告中揭发了在美国东部和南部的一些州里，就有五百多万各种不同种族的人像奴隶一样地生活着，他曾亲眼看到人像牲畜一般被贩卖和带着锁链在皮鞭下进行非人的劳动。美国“保卫工人联盟”的报告也曾承认，在美国有着七种强迫劳动的方式，包括：还债劳工制度，对非法移民的剥削，对精神病患者的强制劳动，战时对外侨的剥削，对印第安人的剥削以及根据塔夫脱—哈特莱法等而实行的强迫劳动。至于美国监狱中对囚犯实行残酷的强制劳动，那更是公开的事实，美国政府甚至把监狱的工厂和种植园租给资本家，让他们从囚犯的强迫劳动中获取暴利。近年来美国疯狂地进行扩张军备，并且已将监狱的生产和战争计划配合起来。“把工厂变成黑暗的监狱，把监狱变成苦役的工厂”，这就是美国实行强迫劳动的写照。
    美国在联合国进行诬蔑宣传是掩盖不住事实的真象的。美国大叫大嚷中华人民共和国存在什么“强迫劳动”，不过是它最近对我国发动的大规模诽谤运动的一部分。它的目的显然是想借此转移人们对美国阴谋扩大侵略中国政策的注意。
