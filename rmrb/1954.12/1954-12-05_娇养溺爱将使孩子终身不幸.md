    Spoiling and Pampering Will Bring Lifelong Misfortune to Children
    To the Editor:
    I am a father of three children. After reading the People's Daily editorial on November 28th, "The Responsibility of Parents for the Moral Education of Children," and recalling the "Post-Trial Conversation" of a father whose son committed a crime, I feel that the responsibility of parents towards their children is extremely important!
    The People's Daily editorial and the "Post-Trial Conversation" raise a serious issue for all parents: Parents must earnestly take responsibility for educating their children. If they are left unattended or spoiled and pampered, it will inevitably lead to lifelong misfortune for the children.
    As far as I understand, among our revolutionary cadres, there are still many problems regarding how to correctly educate children and fulfill parental responsibilities. As the People's Daily editorial pointed out, some parents believe that educating children is the business of nannies and teachers. They often excuse themselves by saying they are busy with work and have no time to care for their children. Therefore, before entering school, they leave their children to the care of nannies. When some children learn bad habits such as lying, hitting, and swearing, their parents do not stop them. Instead, they praise and admire it as a symbol of ability. Later, bad habits increase and deepen day by day, and they just want to send their children to school and think everything will be fine. As a result, the children bring their bad habits to school, adding many difficulties to school education.
    Some parents spoil their children, indulging their willfulness, giving them whatever they want, and helping them reach for the sky if they ask. When children make mistakes and are criticized by teachers, parents feel pain and even defend their children. One child did not cherish public property and often destroyed things. The school asked the parents to cooperate in educating the child, but the parent said: My child is very smart. He destroys things because he wants to invent and create.
    Some parents only care about their children's living problems. When children come home, they always ask how they ate and dressed, and even nitpick, but they never ask about their studies and moral education.
    Regarding the relationship with the school, some parents do not respect the opinions of the school and teachers, do not cooperate with the school in educating their children, and casually say bad things about the school and teachers in front of their children, so that the children do not cherish the school or respect the teachers. Some individual children even discuss behind their backs: "The teacher is just a class or platoon-level cadre. My dad's guard is still a platoon-level cadre! What's so great!"
    The above are all phenomena of parents not caring about or being responsible for their children's education. The brilliant Soviet educator Makarenko once taught parents: You raise and educate your children not only for the joy of being parents. In your family, under your leadership, you are cultivating future citizens, future entrepreneurs, and future soldiers. If you educate bad people, then the pain from this will not only be yours, but also many people's, the entire nation's.
    The People's Daily editorial stated: "Concern for the communist moral education of children should become a new social trend." I feel that our revolutionary cadres should be role models for the masses in family and children's education. Therefore, I must earnestly take on my responsibilities and cultivate my children into knowledgeable, persevering, hard-working citizens who are loyal to their motherland and the revolutionary cause.

### 娇养溺爱将使孩子终身不幸

    娇养溺爱将使孩子终身不幸编辑同志：
    我是一个有了三个孩子的父亲。当我看了十一月二十八日人民日报发表的“家长对子女道德教育的责任”的社论，又想起一个儿子犯了罪的父亲在“审判后的谈话”，感到父母对子女的责任十分重大！
    人民日报社论和“审判后的谈话”向一切做父母的提出了一个严重的问题：父母必须切实担负起教育子女的责任，如果放任不管或娇养溺爱，必然给孩子造成终身的不幸。
    据我了解，在我们革命干部中有些同志对于如何正确地教育子女，负起父母的责任，还有不少问题。正如人民日报社论指出的有的父母认为教育孩子是保姆和教师的事情。他们常常借口自己工作忙，没时间管孩子，因而在入学以前，就把孩子交给保姆去管；有的孩子学会了说谎、打人、骂人等不良习惯，父母也不加制止，反而把它当做一种能干的象征来赞扬、欣赏。后来，坏习惯也一天一天加多了、加深了，他们只想把孩子送到学校去就好了。结果，孩子把坏习惯带到了学校，给学校教育增加了很多困难。
    有的父母溺爱孩子，娇养任性，孩子要怎样就怎样，要什么就给什么，孩子如果要上天，父母也愿意搭梯子。孩子有了错误受到教师的批评，父母就觉着肉痛，甚至为孩子辩护。有一个孩子很不爱护公物，经常破坏东西。学校请家长配合教育，这个家长却说：我的孩子很聪明，他破坏东西是因为他想发明创造。
    有些父母只关心孩子的生活问题，孩子回家，总是问吃得怎样、穿得怎样，甚至挑剔一番，但对学习和品德教育却一点也不过问。
    在对学校的关系上，有的家长不尊重学校和老师的意见，不配合学校对孩子进行教育，随便在孩子面前说学校、老师如何不好，以致孩子也不爱护学校、不尊重老师。个别孩子甚至背后议论：“老师不过是班、排级干部，我爸爸的警卫员还是个排级干部呢！有什么了不起！”
    以上这些都是父母对子女教育不关心、不负责的现象。苏联天才的教育家马卡连柯曾经教诲作父母的说：你们生养和教育儿女，不仅是为了作父母的愉快。在你们的家庭里，在你们的领导下，培养着未来的公民，未来的事业家，未来的战士。如果你们教育出不好的人来，那么，由此所得的苦痛，不仅是你们的，而且是许多人的，是整个国家的。
    人民日报社论上说：“关心子女的共产主义道德教育，应当成为新社会的风气。”我觉得我们革命干部在家庭子女教育方面应该是群众的榜样。因此，我要切实担负起我的责任，把我的孩子培养成一个有知识的、有毅力的、爱劳动的、忠于自己的祖国和革命事业的公民。　章健之
