Xinhua News Agency, December 25th:

    The people of Tianjin and Shenyang support the issuance of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds and are preparing to enthusiastically subscribe. Liu Zhonghui, a worker in the tile-making workshop of the Tianjin Municipal State-Owned Zhenye Asbestos Factory and a demobilized soldier, said after hearing the news of the issuance of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds: "Next year is the third year of our country's first five-year plan. The country needs to build more factories, which requires a lot of funds. Issuing bonds is necessary and in line with our long-term interests." Some members of the Communist Youth League and youth from the Third District Office of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China held a forum on the 21st. Everyone enthusiastically supported the national issuance of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds and decided to do a good job in publicizing the sale of the bonds, and expressed their willingness to actively subscribe.
    The Shenyang Shoe and Boot Production Cooperative reprinted the news of the issuance of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds on the cooperative's blackboard newspaper. Guo Yalin, a young lathe operator at the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, said excitedly: "I have personally seen our factory built from the ground up. The state has invested a lot of money in this project, which is the result of the support of the people of the whole country. When the 1954 bonds were issued, I actively subscribed, and this time, I will subscribe even more actively." Song Zongyu, manager of the privately-owned Xingye Tungsten Gold Factory and deputy director of the preparatory committee of the Nanshi District Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "It is everyone's responsibility to purchase bonds. I will definitely respond to the government's call, and together with the city's industrialists and businessmen, promote the spirit of patriotism and buy more bonds."

    【新华社二十五日讯】天津市和沈阳市人民拥护一九五五年国家经济建设公债的发行，并准备踊跃认购。天津市地方国营振业石棉厂制瓦车间工人、转业军人刘忠惠，听到发行一九五五年国家经济建设公债的消息以后说：“明年是我们国家第一个五年建设计划的第三年，国家要兴建更多的工厂，需要很多资金，发行公债是必要的，是符合我们长远利益的。”中国人民银行天津分行三区办事处的部分青年团员和青年，在二十一日开了一个座谈会，大家都热烈拥护国家发行一九五五年国家经济建设公债，决定作好推销公债的宣传工作，并表示自己要踊跃认购。
    沈阳市靴鞋生产合作社把发行一九五五年国家经济建设公债的消息转载在社里的黑板报上。沈阳风动工具工厂青年车工郭亚林兴奋地说：“我亲眼看到我们厂子从平地上建设起来了。在这个工程里，国家投入大量资金，这是全国人民支援的结果。发行一九五四年公债的时候，我就积极认购了，这次，更要积极认购。”私营兴业钨金工厂经理、南市区工商业联合会筹备委员会副主任委员宋宗禹说：“购买公债人人有责，我一定响应政府号召，和全市工商业者一道，发扬爱国主义精神，多买公债。”
