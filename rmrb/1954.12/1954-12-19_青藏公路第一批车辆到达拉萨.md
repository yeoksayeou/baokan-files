    Lhasa, December 18th (By our own correspondent) The entire Qinghai-Tibet Highway has been completed, and the first vehicles arrived in Lhasa at 2:00 PM on the 15th.
    On the afternoon of the 15th, people excitedly awaited the arrival of the first vehicles on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. Chen Mingyi, Commander of the Kangzang Highway Construction Headquarters, and Rang Mingde, Political Commissar, arrived at the newly built parking lot in front of the Potala Palace. At 2:00 PM, several vehicles sped from the west on the highway. People cheered enthusiastically: "The Qinghai-Tibet Highway is open!" As soon as the first vehicles stopped, the people gathered in the square swarmed around them. People rushed forward to shake hands with Mu Shengzhong, Political Commissar of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Construction Engineering Team, congratulating him on the arrival of the first vehicles in Lhasa. The Qinghai-Tibet Highway is more than 2,000 kilometers long, passing through areas inhabited by fraternal ethnic groups such as Mongolians, Tibetans, Hui, and Kazakhs. It crosses fifteen major mountains, including Riyue Mountain, Kunlun Mountain, and Tanggula Mountain, and traverses twenty-five rivers, including the Huangshui, Chumar, and Ulan Mulun. It also crosses grasslands and basins such as the Qaidam, Hoh Xil, and Qiangtang. The average elevation of the entire line is more than 4,000 meters. The 820 kilometers from Xining to Golmud in the Qaidam Basin is the Qinghai-Xinjiang Highway built by the bandit Ma Bufang, and the original route has long been destroyed. After Qinghai's liberation, it has been repaired over the years and is now open to traffic. In May of this year, Mu Shengzhong, Political Commissar of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Construction Engineering Team, led workers to build southwards from Golmud. On November 16th, the highway reached Heihe in Tibet. On December 12th, the final key project, the Yangbajing Stone Gorge, was opened, and on December 15th, it was completed to Lhasa.

    青藏公路第一批车辆到达拉萨
    【本报拉萨十八日电】青藏公路全线修通了，第一批车辆已在十五日下午二时到达拉萨。
    十五日下午，人们兴奋地等待着青藏公路第一批车辆的到来，康藏公路修建司令部司令员陈明义、政治委员穰明德等都来到了布达拉宫前新修的停车场上。下午二时，从西边的公路上驰来了几辆汽车，人们热烈地欢呼着：“青藏公路修通了！”当第一批汽车刚停下来，聚在广场上的人们蜂拥地围住汽车。人们拥上前和青藏公路修建工程队政治委员慕生忠亲切地握手，庆贺青藏公路第一批车辆到达拉萨。青藏公路全长二千多公里，沿途经过蒙、藏、回、哈萨克等兄弟民族地区，翻过日月山、昆仑山、唐古拉山等十五座大山，越过湟水、楚马尔、乌兰木仑等二十五条河流，跨过柴达木、霍霍西里、羌塘等草原和盆地。全线地势平均海拔高达四千多公尺。从西宁到柴达木盆地的噶尔穆八百二十公里，是马匪步芳所修的青新公路，原有路线久已塌毁。青海解放后，经过历年整修，已经通车。今年五月，青藏公路修建工程队政治委员慕生忠率领工人，从噶尔穆向南修筑，十一月十六日公路通到西藏的黑河，十二月十二日打通最后一段重点工程——羊八井石峡，十五日修到拉萨。
