In the statement regarding the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," our Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Enlai, solemnly declared to the world the unwavering determination of China's 600 million people: We must liberate Taiwan. The Chinese working class resolutely supports Minister Zhou's statement. The Chinese working class firmly opposes the illegal treaty signed by the US and Chiang Kai-shek, which is an act of aggression against our territory Taiwan and a preparation for new wars.

The Chinese working class expresses extreme anger at the blatant and barbarous act of US imperialism in occupying our territory Taiwan, and expresses extreme contempt for the shameless intimidation of our people by US imperialism.

No sophist can find any basis to prove that Taiwan is not Chinese territory. The Chinese people absolutely will not allow US imperialism to occupy Taiwan, and absolutely cannot agree to the absurd propositions of a so-called "independent Taiwan," a "neutralized" Taiwan, or a "trusteeship" of Taiwan. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan from the tyranny of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

Imperialism has always protected China's traitorous cliques and has always intimidated the Chinese people. Imperialism sent troops to protect the Qing Dynasty and intimidate the Chinese people; it sent troops to protect the Northern Warlords and intimidate the Chinese people. US imperialism once sent troops to defend large cities and transportation lines for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, in order to protect the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and intimidate the Chinese people. Didn't all of this prove futile? Haven't the reactionary ruling groups of China, protected by imperialism, already rolled into the grave, or are rolling into the grave? Haven't the Chinese people, intimidated by imperialism, already stood up magnificently? Now, US imperialism attempts to protect a handful of political corpses entrenched in Taiwan, and attempts to intimidate the Chinese people who have never been afraid of intimidation and have already achieved victory. Isn't this still futile?

The Chinese working class resolutely supports Minister Zhou's statement with practical actions. Producing more steel, iron, coal, petroleum... to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan is the Chinese working class's answer to the barbaric provocation of US imperialism.

### 中华全国总工会负责人的谈话

    中华全国总工会负责人的谈话
    我国外交部长周恩来在关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明中，向全世界郑重地宣告了全中国六万万人民的不可动摇的决心：我们一定要解放台湾。中国工人阶级坚决拥护周外长的声明。中国工人阶级坚决反对美蒋非法签订的侵略我国领土台湾并准备新的战争的条约。
    中国工人阶级对于美帝国主义明目张胆地侵占我国领土台湾的野蛮行为，表示极大的愤怒，对于美帝国主义向我国人民的无耻的恫吓，表示极大的藐视。
    任何诡辩家也不能找出丝毫根据来证明台湾不是中国的领土。中国人民绝对不许美帝国主义侵占台湾、也绝对不能同意所谓台湾“独立国”、台湾“中立化”和“托管”台湾的荒谬主张。中国人民一定要把台湾从蒋介石卖国集团的暴政下解放出来。
    帝国主义从来就是保护中国的卖国集团的，从来就是恫吓中国人民的。帝国主义为了保护满清王朝和恫吓中国人民，出过兵；为了保护北洋军阀和恫吓中国人民，出过兵。美帝国主义为了保护蒋介石卖国集团和恫吓中国人民，曾经派兵替蒋介石卖国集团防守大城市和交通线。这一切，难道不是都枉费了心机吗？帝国主义所保护的中国的反动统治集团，不是都已经滚进了坟墓，或者正在滚进坟墓里吗？帝国主义所恫吓的中国人民，不是已经雄伟地站立起来了吗？现在，美帝国主义企图保护盘踞台湾的一小撮政治僵尸，企图恫吓从来不怕恫吓而且已经胜利了的中国人民，难道不还是枉费心机吗？
    中国工人阶级坚决地以实际行动来拥护周外长的声明。生产更多的钢、铁、煤炭、石油……，支援解放台湾的斗争，这就是中国工人阶级对美帝国主义的野蛮挑衅的回答。
