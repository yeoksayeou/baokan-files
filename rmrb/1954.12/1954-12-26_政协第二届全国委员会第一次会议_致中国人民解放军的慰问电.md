    Message of Condolence from the First Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC to the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    To all commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

    The First Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference unanimously expresses its indignation at the so-called "mutual defense treaty" signed by the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This is a serious act of war provocation against our country by the U.S. aggressive group. The entire Chinese people are determined to fight to the end with all their strength to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang bandits, defend the motherland, and defend peace.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the strong defender of the motherland's security. You have been giving strong blows to the Chiang bandits on the East China Sea front and have achieved brilliant victories. We are convinced that you will further carry forward the glorious tradition of revolutionary heroism, persist in fighting, and victoriously complete the historical task of liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang bandits.

    Our entire conference extends our highest respect and warm regards to you!

    The First Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

    December 25, 1954, in Beijing
