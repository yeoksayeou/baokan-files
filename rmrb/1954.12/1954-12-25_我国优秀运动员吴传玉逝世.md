Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: Wu Chuanyu, a representative of the National People's Congress and an outstanding swimming athlete in China, tragically died in a plane crash on October 29th while en route to Hungary.

　　Wu Chuanyu was originally from Fujian Province and was born in Indonesia in August 1928. He returned to China in 1951. In recent years, he worked hard to study politics, diligently trained his skills, and made rapid progress. He participated in many international competitions, including the 15th International Olympic Games as a member of the Chinese sports delegation. He won the first place in the men's 100-meter backstroke and the third place in the 100-meter freestyle at the International Student Games in 1952. In 1953, he won the first place in the men's 100-meter backstroke at the International Friendship Sports Competition of the 4th World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival. This year, he won the second place in the 100-meter backstroke and butterfly stroke at the 12th World Student Summer Games.

　　Wu Chuanyu was humble and simple in his style, diligent in his studies and training, and enthusiastically helped other athletes, fully embodying the excellent qualities of athletes in New China. He was elected as a member of the Second National Committee of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth and a representative of the First National People's Congress. His unfortunate death on official duty is a great loss to the cause of sports in the Chinese people.

　　A funeral committee has been established under the auspices of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China, with Cai Tingkai as the chairman and Cai Shupan as the vice chairman, and a memorial service will be held soon.
