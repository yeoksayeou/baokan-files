Fu Lianzhang, Chairman of the General Council of the Chinese Medical Association, Issues a Statement
    Fu Lianzhang, Chairman of the General Council of the Chinese Medical Association, issued a statement denouncing the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The statement is as follows:
    The US imperialists, disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese government and people, have brazenly signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This treaty illegally infringes upon our country's sovereignty, blatantly occupies our territory, and seriously threatens peace in Asia and the world. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on this treaty forcefully exposed the treaty's sinister purposes and solemnly declared our country's solemn position. We medical workers warmly support this statement. In order to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in order to strive for genuine and lasting world peace, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. Any treaty signed by the American aggressive bloc and the Chiang Kai-shek traitors, including this US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," is fundamentally illegal and therefore invalid.
    We medical workers, like the people of the whole country, love peace. At this time, facing the great task of liberating Taiwan, we must unite as one and strengthen our work in all aspects, ready to respond to the government's call at any time and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan.

Xiraojiacuo said: The United States is the enemy of our country and also the enemy of our religious followers. The enemy's intentions are the most evil, and our intentions are the most benevolent. We Buddhists should heighten our vigilance, prevent the enemy's instigation and exploitation, and we will never give the enemy any convenience. We must strengthen the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and work hard to liberate Taiwan and defend world peace.

    Li Shunda and Others Resolve to Work Hard to Support the Struggle to Liberate Taiwan
    National People's Congress representatives, famous agricultural labor models Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, and Shen Jilan, and local farmers, after studying Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" published in the newspaper, unanimously expressed their determination to support this just statement with practical actions. Currently, farmers in the two townships of Xigou and Chuandi, where they are located, have delivered more than 110,000 jin of surplus grain to the state grain purchasing station in advance, and are carrying out winter production tensely in the face of the severe cold.
    Li Shunda, recipient of the Gold Star Medal, said after reading Foreign Minister Zhou's statement: "The illegal signing of this treaty by the US and Chiang to invade our country's territory of Taiwan and prepare for a new war can only increase the Chinese people's anger and strengthen the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan." He expressed that he would take the lead in guiding the broad masses of farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and strive to increase grain production with practical actions to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan. National People's Congress representative Shen Jilan expressed her intention to lead the young men and women of Xigou Township to transform their anger into fighting power, work hard to increase production, study diligently, exercise their bodies, and do a good job in providing preferential treatment and substitute farming. The farmers of Xigou and Chuandi townships put forward such a combat slogan: In order to liberate Taiwan, the country will have grain if it needs grain, and people if it needs people. They pointed out one after another that if the American imperialists dare to provoke a war of aggression and destroy our peaceful and happy life, they will surely be smashed to pieces.

    Many Military Dependents in Shanghai Encourage Their Relatives to Strengthen the Struggle to Liberate Taiwan
    Many letters from families of revolutionary soldiers, encouraging their relatives to liberate Taiwan, are constantly being sent from Shanghai to the front lines of Zhejiang and Fujian.
    Fifty-nine-year-old book folder He Ruiqing wrote to her son-in-law, who is defending an island on the Zhejiang front line, saying: In this cold winter, you are fighting fiercely with Chiang's bandit troops for the liberation of eight million compatriots in Taiwan, for the socialist construction of the motherland, and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world. I feel honored and proud. Another letter sent to the front lines of the Zhoushan Islands was written by Chen Songlin, a Young Pioneer with excellent grades, to his father. The letter said: Liberating Taiwan, what a glorious thing! Dad, you liberate Taiwan, and I will study hard.
    In their letters to their relatives, the military dependents expressed their support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." Sixty-seven-year-old Guo Jinchen wrote to his grandson, who works on a warship, saying: Chiang's bandits and the American aggressive bloc occupy Taiwan, and their ferocity and cruelty are no different from tigers and wolves. If this evil is not eliminated, our country will have no peace. Military dependent Zhou Taikui encouraged his son in a letter: Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," every word and sentence is a voice of justice. You must fight together with your comrades to the end to liberate the motherland's territory - Taiwan.
    Many letters from military dependents from factories expressed that they would support the struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan with actions of increasing production and practicing economy. Liu Hongyou, a model worker and military dependent of the joint state-private Xinsheng Cotton Mill who has saved a large amount of capital for the country, wrote to his son, who works in an artillery unit in Xiamen, saying: I will definitely continue to use my brains and find ways to maintain the machines better, save more raw materials, accumulate capital for the country, and support your fighting.
