    European Peoples Resolve to Defeat the Paris Agreement
    Bulgaria
    The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian Council of Ministers held a joint meeting on the 10th and 11th, listening to the report by Anton Yugov, head of the Bulgarian government delegation, on the Moscow European countries conference. The first secretaries of the district party committees and the chairmen of the district people's councils also attended the meeting.
    The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution expressing agreement with the work of the Moscow conference and the work of the Bulgarian government delegation, and expressing full support for the conference's declaration. The resolution stated that the Moscow conference declaration reflects the fundamental interests of the participating countries, reflects their legitimate concerns about the revival of German militarism, and reflects their will to safeguard peace and ensure the security of Europe and the world.
    The resolution stated that the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers will take necessary measures to widely publicize the Moscow conference's declaration, and will do everything possible to make the realization of the declaration a matter of vital concern to all the Bulgarian people.
      Poland
    The All-Poland Committee of the National Front of Poland held a plenary meeting in Warsaw on the 14th and unanimously adopted a resolution supporting the Moscow European countries conference declaration.
    The resolution stated that the Polish people most resolutely oppose policies that threaten peace and the security of the European countries. The Moscow conference issued a warning to the organizers of war that their policies would have tragic consequences. The Moscow conference mapped out a program of action to ensure peace and security in Europe. The conference repeatedly pointed out that only a collective security system can avoid the threat of a revived German militarism and ensure lasting peace in Europe and the world. The Moscow conference clearly demonstrated the unity of all peace-loving countries and clearly indicated to the Polish people that Poland is no longer as isolated as it was in 1939, and that it enjoys the sincere friendship, assistance, and support of the powerful peace camp of 900 million people.
    The resolution emphasized that the Polish people will join with the people of other countries in doing their utmost to defend the cause of peace.
    German Democratic Republic
    Throughout the German Democratic Republic, rallies and demonstrations have been held against the ratification of the Paris Agreement and in support of the Moscow European countries conference declaration.
    In Hennigsdorf, a mass meeting was held on the 13th. More than 10,000 workers from various factories in the city attended the meeting. The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution calling on all parliamentary groups in the Bonn Bundestag to reject the Paris Agreement and calling for mutual understanding among Germans. Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic spoke at the meeting. He called on all German patriots to unite more closely to fight against the Paris Agreement and strive for a peaceful resolution of the German question. He emphasized that if the Paris Agreement were to be ratified, the German Democratic Republic would have no choice but to establish national armed forces in order to defend peace, safeguard the national interests of the German people, and protect the achievements of the working people of the German Democratic Republic.
    In Magdeburg, more than 100,000 people participated in a demonstration protesting the Paris Agreement and striving for German unity, and unanimously adopted a resolution welcoming the Moscow conference declaration.
    Mass rallies were held in Rostock, Leipzig, Dresden, and other places to protest against West German remilitarization and oppose the Paris Agreement.
      West Germany
    The West German Bundestag's decision to begin debating the Paris Agreement on the rearmament of West Germany on the 15th has aroused widespread anger and protest among the people throughout West Germany.
    The Düsseldorf construction workers' union decided to send representatives to deliver a petition to all parliamentary groups in the Bonn Bundestag, demanding that West German parliamentarians oppose the ratification of the Paris Agreement, oppose remilitarization, and oppose conscription when the Bundestag discusses the Paris Agreement on the 15th.
    Many West German trade union workers have demanded that action be taken to implement the resolution of the Third Congress of the West German Trade Union Federation against rearmament.
    Trade union workers in Solingen, Hamburg, Essen, Recklinghausen, and other cities have already stated that they will not do any work related to rearmament.
    Among West German youth, opposition to conscription is particularly strong. In Stuttgart, 1,200 young workers held a rally on the 10th against conscription. Hans Siegel, chairman of the carpentry union, called on the young people to tear up the notices calling them into military service.
    In Augsburg, the Bonn war department—the "Blank Department"—organized a rally to promote military service. Blank himself was scheduled to speak at the meeting, but the angry shouts of thousands of people forced him to stagger off the stage and even be beaten by the crowd.
      United Kingdom
    In the United Kingdom, a movement is underway to oppose the revival of German militarism and demand negotiations with the Soviet Union for a peaceful resolution of the German question.
    Gordon Schaffer, chairman of the British Peace Committee, wrote to peace committees throughout the United Kingdom on the 13th, calling on all peace-loving people to intensify their efforts to defeat the London and Paris Agreements. Schaffer condemned the government's refusal to negotiate and its insistence on arming West Germany, and pointed out that once the London and Paris Agreements are ratified, the basis for four-power negotiations will disappear. Schaffer therefore called on the people to take immediate action and insist on an immediate four-power conference.
    At the 15th annual meeting of young members of the Scottish Trades Union Congress in Glasgow, Guy, chairman of the Scottish Trades Union Congress Youth Consultative Committee, condemned the London and Paris Agreements. He said that all those concerned about the fate of the youth of the motherland should understand that establishing a new nine-nation military bloc under this agreement is a crime.
      Italy
    On the 12th, Italy held a nationwide "Day of Struggle Against the Ratification of the Paris Agreement and the Arming of Germany." This event was organized by the Italian National Peace Council. Its purpose was to explain the dangers of reviving German militarism to the broad masses of the people as much as possible.
    Hundreds of rallies were held on this day. Many people with different political views gave speeches at various rallies, denouncing the Paris Agreement for deepening the danger of a new war.

    保加利亚
    保加利亚共产党中央委员会和保加利亚部长会议在十日和十一日举行联席会议，听取保加利亚政府代表团团长安东·于哥夫关于莫斯科欧洲国家会议的报告。各地的区党委员会第一书记和区人民会议的主席也参加了这次会议。
    会议一致通过决议，表示同意莫斯科会议的工作和保加利亚政府代表团的工作，并且表示完全拥护会议宣言。决议说：莫斯科会议宣言反映出与会各国的根本利益，反映出它们对于德国军国主义复活的正当的忧虑，并且反映出它们维护和平和保障欧洲与世界安全的意志。
    决议说：保加利亚共产党中央委员会和部长会议将采取必要的措施，以便广泛地宣传莫斯科会议的宣言，并将竭尽一切努力使宣言的实现成为保加利亚全体人民的切身事业。
      波　兰
    波兰全国阵线全波委员会十四日在华沙举行了全体会议，一致通过了拥护莫斯科欧洲国家会议宣言的决议。
    决议说，波兰人民最坚决地反对威胁和平和欧洲各国人民安全的政策。莫斯科会议向战争组织者发出警告：他们的政策将产生悲惨的后果。莫斯科会议规划出保障欧洲和平和安全的行动纲领。会议一再指出，只有集体安全体系才能避免复活德国军国主义的威胁和确保欧洲和全世界的持久和平。莫斯科会议清楚地表现了所有爱好和平的国家的团结，并且向波兰人民明白地指出了波兰不再像在一九三九年那样孤立了，它得到九亿人口的强大和平阵营的真诚友谊、援助和支持。
    决议强调指出：波兰人民将和其他国家人民一道用全力保卫和平事业。
    德意志民主共和国
    德意志民主共和国全国各地都举行集会和示威，反对批准巴黎协定，拥护莫斯科欧洲国家会议的宣言。
    在赫宁斯多夫，十三日举行了群众大会。出席这次大会的有这一城市各工厂的一万多名职工。会议一致通过决议，要求波恩联邦议院各议会党团拒绝巴黎协定，并且要求在德国人之间的互相谅解。德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在会议上讲了话。他号召全体德国爱国者更加紧密地团结起来，为反对巴黎协定和争取和平解决德国问题而斗争。他着重说：如果巴黎协定竟然被批准，德意志民主共和国为了保卫和平、为了维护德国人民的民族利益和德意志民主共和国劳动人民的成就，就不得不建立国家武装力量。
    在马格德堡，有十万多人参加了一次抗议巴黎协定和争取德国统一的示威运动，并且一致通过了一项欢迎莫斯科会议宣言的决议。
    在罗斯托克、来比锡和德累斯顿等地都举行了群众大会，抗议西德重新军国主义化，反对巴黎协定。
      西　德
    西德联邦议院决定在十五日开始辩论重新武装西德的巴黎协定，引起了西德各地人民广泛的愤怒和抗议。
    杜塞尔多夫的建筑工人工会决定派遣代表把一份请求书送交给波恩联邦议院所有的议会党团，要求西德的议员们在十五日联邦议院讨论巴黎协定时反对批准巴黎协定，反对重新军国主义化和征兵。
    许多西德工会工作者都要求采取行动来实现西德工会联合会第三次代表大会关于反对重新武装的决议。
    索林根、汉堡、埃森、勒克灵豪森等城市的工会工作者已经表示他们将不做任何一种同重新武装有关的工作。
    在西德青年中，反对征兵的情绪特别强烈。在斯图加特，有一千二百个青年工人在十日举行了一次集会反对征兵，木工工会主席汉斯·西格尔在会上号召青年们撕毁征召他们入伍的通知单。
    在奥格斯堡，波恩的战争部——“布兰克部”组织了一次宣传兵役的集会，布兰克本人预定要在会上讲话，但是，数千群众的愤怒喊声迫使他狼狈地走下了讲台，并且挨到了群众的殴打。
      英　国
    在英国，反对复活德国军国主义，要求和苏联谈判和平解决德国问题的运动正在开展。
    英国和平委员会主席戈登·夏菲尔在十三日写信给英国各地的和平委员会，号召所有爱和平的人加紧努力，击败伦敦和巴黎协定。夏菲尔谴责政府拒绝谈判和坚持武装西德的态度，并且指出伦敦和巴黎协定一旦批准，四国谈判的基础就会消失。夏菲尔因此号召人民立即采取行动，坚持立即召开四国会议。
    在格拉斯哥举行的苏格兰职工大会第十五届青年会员年会上，苏格兰职工大会青年协商委员会主席盖依谴责伦敦和巴黎协定。他说：所有担心祖国青年的命运的人都应该懂得：根据这种协定建立新的九国军事集团是一种罪行：
      意大利
    十二日，意大利全国举行了“反对批准巴黎协定和武装德国斗争日”。这个活动是由意大利全国和平理事会组织的。它的目的是要尽可能地向广大人民群众说明复活德国军国主义的危险。
    这一天举行了数以百计的集会，许多具有不同政治观点的人在各种集会上发表了演说，斥责巴黎协定加深新战争的危险。
