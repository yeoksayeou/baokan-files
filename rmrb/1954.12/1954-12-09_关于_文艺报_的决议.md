Resolution on "Literary Gazette"
(Adopted by the Enlarged Joint Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association on December 8, 1954)

On October 28, 1954, "People's Daily" published a severe criticism of the erroneous attitude taken by "Literary Gazette" in the discussion of the "Dream of the Red Chamber" research issue. The Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association jointly convened several enlarged meetings starting from October 31 to examine the work of "Literary Gazette." At the meeting, many comrades in literary and art circles further exposed many ideological and stylistic errors of "Literary Gazette." These errors mainly included: tolerance and surrender to bourgeois erroneous ideas in literature and art; disregard and suppression of new Marxist forces; and the bad style of crudeness, arbitrariness, and suppression of free discussion in literary criticism. The nature of these errors is serious, violating the Marxist stand and the Party's literary and artistic policies.

Yu Pingbo's "Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber" and some of his articles on "Dream of the Red Chamber" published in recent years are erroneous works that promote Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist viewpoints. These works seriously distort our classical literature and spread poison among the masses. "Literary Gazette" not only failed to criticize these works but also published an article in its ninth issue of 1953 recommending "Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber." Before and after this, the editorial department of "Literary Gazette" refused to publish or ignored articles by Bai Dun, Li Xifan, Lan Ling, and others criticizing Yu Pingbo's erroneous viewpoints from a Marxist perspective. It was only after Li Xifan and Lan Ling's articles were published in the "Wen Shi Zhe" magazine that they were reprinted in "Literary Gazette" due to readers' suggestions. When reprinting, the editors added an erroneous editor's note that belittled the significance of this criticism. These facts show that the errors committed by "Literary Gazette" on the "Dream of the Red Chamber" issue were by no means accidental. The editors of "Literary Gazette" forgot that "Literary Gazette" is a publication that promotes Marxist literary and artistic thought and has the responsibility to fight against all anti-Marxist erroneous literary and artistic thoughts. On the contrary, they were willing to bow down before bourgeois thought and willing to praise and defend anti-Marxist literary and artistic thought. This is intolerable.

Since the editors of "Literary Gazette" have become prisoners of bourgeois thought, they will inevitably become estranged from the new Marxist forces and even adopt a bourgeois aristocratic master-like attitude of contempt and suppression towards them. "Literary Gazette's" attitude towards young writers and critics is arrogant and lacks enthusiasm. During this examination work, the editorial department of "Literary Gazette" discovered that many of the manuscripts returned in the past should not have been returned. The reason why these manuscripts were returned was often because they criticized a certain "authority" or a big celebrity, while the writers were "small people." Therefore, fewer and fewer works by young writers and critics and readers' letters were published in "Literary Gazette." "Literary Gazette" rarely gave enthusiastic encouragement and support to the works of some young writers who were welcomed by the masses and had a new atmosphere; when criticizing these works, they often ignored the overall tendency of these works, but often used simple methods and crude attitudes to pick on shortcomings and casually negate the labor achievements of others. "Literary Gazette's" attitude towards Bai Dun, Li Xifan, and Lan Ling, and the cold criticism attitude adopted towards Li Zhun's novel "Cannot Take That Road" in January of this year, are the most prominent examples.

On the one hand, "Literary Gazette" surrendered to bourgeois erroneous thoughts, and on the other hand, the criticism of literary and artistic works with progressive tendencies often adopted a crude, arbitrary, and repressive attitude towards free discussion. For a long time, there has been a kind of self-righteous "authority" thought and nihilistic viewpoint of negating everything in the criticism work of "Literary Gazette." It lacked both the spirit of seeking truth from facts and the comradely attitude of being kind to people. It often used doctrinaire simple formulas to criticize a work, but did not allow others to conduct counter-criticism. For those works with basically correct tendencies but still have shortcomings, instead of helping the authors to overcome the shortcomings with enthusiastic encouragement, they were attacked with nitpicking and a master-like picking. This kind of crude and arbitrary criticism has brought great damage to literary and artistic creation. "Literary Gazette" has also promoted many erroneous theories (such as the "theory of no conflict," etc.), but they have never criticized and corrected the erroneous theories that they have published and promoted. Literary and art circles and readers have long had opinions on "Literary Gazette," but the editors of "Literary Gazette" did not face up to their mistakes, did not pay attention to others' criticism of their mistakes, but adopted an attitude of rejecting criticism. They thought that only they had the right to criticize others, but they had no obligation to listen to others' criticism. They mistakenly thought that openly conducting self-criticism or accepting criticism of their shortcomings and errors would damage the "prestige" of the publication. This self-righteous "authority" attitude blocked the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism in literary and artistic work, hindered the healthy development of free discussion in literary and art circles, and made "Literary Gazette" lose its role as an active organizer of ideological struggle, and become a bureaucratic publication that was detached from the masses and high above.

"Literary Gazette" had set up an editorial committee, but many editorial committee members were unable to play a role. The editor-in-chief lacked due respect for them. Many important issues were not discussed with the editorial committee members, and important manuscripts were not shown to the editorial committee members, making the editorial committee a nominal thing. Later, the editor-in-chief proposed to simply abolish the editorial committee.

All the above facts show that "Literary Gazette" violated the Marxist stand and the Party's literary and artistic policies, and violated the principles of collective leadership and criticism and self-criticism. In the past year, many of the ideas and practices promoted by "Literary Gazette" have been contrary to the spirit of the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers.

The Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association believe that: The reason why "Literary Gazette" produced these errors is that the editors of "Literary Gazette" seriously have bourgeois ideology and bourgeois style. This is the main root of all the errors of "Literary Gazette." It is this bourgeois ideology and bourgeois style that made the editors of "Literary Gazette" happy to defend anti-Marxist literary and artistic thought and bourgeois celebrities, but often used the attitude of aristocratic masters to obliterate and suppress the new Marxist forces.

It should be pointed out that since its inception, "Literary Gazette" has done a lot of work that is beneficial to the people and has achieved certain results. However, the editors of "Literary Gazette" regarded those achievements as their own, thus fostering an extremely proud and complacent mood and a decadent "authority" thought, which made "Literary Gazette" more detached from reality and the masses, and the masses' dissatisfaction with "Literary Gazette" became greater and greater.

The errors committed by "Literary Gazette" are inseparable from the weak leadership of the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association in literary and artistic thought and the lack of a sense of responsibility for the people's cause. The Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association accepted the entrustment of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to lead the work of "Literary Gazette," but abandoned its due responsibility, did not regularly and seriously examine the work of "Literary Gazette," so that it failed to correct the errors of "Literary Gazette" in time. The leading organs of literature and art are mostly busy with trivial matters, and rarely study the ideological trends existing in the literary and art circles, and have not seriously drawn lessons from the criticism of the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun" in 1951. The erroneous tendency of tolerance and surrender to bourgeois ideology exists more or less in the work of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association and other publications and organs under their leadership. After examining the work of "Literary Gazette," the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association must further examine and improve their own leadership work; at the same time, they call on literary and artistic groups and literary publications across the country to conduct the same examination and improve their work.

The Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association pointed out that "Literary Gazette" should seriously and thoroughly correct its errors through this examination. "Literary Gazette" should become a publication that truly promotes Marxist literary and artistic thought and carries out healthy and principled literary criticism. It should fight against various erroneous literary and artistic thoughts of the bourgeoisie and resolutely overcome the tendency of capitulationism; it should actively support the new Marxist forces and resolutely overcome the tendency of despising and suppressing the new forces; it should conduct free discussions on literary and artistic thought with leadership and planning. At the same time, other literary publications should also carry out literary criticism and free discussions in the same spirit, so as to ensure that the literary and artistic cause can develop healthily under the guidance of Marxist thought, and truly shoulder the glorious task of serving the country's socialist construction cause.

The Joint Meeting of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association resolved:

1. Reorganize the editorial organization of "Literary Gazette," re-establish the editorial committee, and implement the principle of collective leadership.
2. Order the new editorial committee of "Literary Gazette" to propose methods to resolutely overcome the errors pointed out in this resolution, correct the editorial policy of the publication, and make "Literary Gazette" a publication with a clear combat direction and practical style. The content should focus on literary criticism, and at the same time, publish comments and introductions on the people's cultural and artistic life, and strive to expand and closely connect literature and art with the lives of the broad masses of people.
3. The Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles ordered the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to improve the leadership work of "Literary Gazette." "Literary Gazette" should establish close contact with the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China in its work.
4. Order "People's Literature" and other publications under the leadership of the Chinese Writers Association and the publications of its local branches to strengthen literary criticism work, and propose specific plans for carrying out literary criticism and free discussions.
5. Order the editorial organizations of the organs publications of the Chinese Writers' Association, the Chinese Dramatists' Association, the Chinese Musicians' Association, the China Artists Association and the subordinate local branches and the organs publications of the literary federations of provinces and cities to conduct work inspection and improvement of work according to the guidelines of this resolution.
6. The Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association should convene the Second Council of the Chinese Writers Association in the spring of 1955 to discuss the improvement of the leadership work of the Writers Association.

### 关于“文艺报”的决议

    关于“文艺报”的决议
    （一九五四年十二月八日中国文学艺术界联合会主席团、中国作家协会主席团扩大联席会议通过）
    一九五四年十月二十八日的“人民日报”对“文艺报”在“红楼梦”研究问题的讨论中所采取的错误态度，进行了严厉的批评。中国文学艺术界联合会主席团和中国作家协会主席团从十月三十一日起联合召开了几次扩大会议，检查了“文艺报”的工作。在会议上，文艺界的许多同志进一步揭发了“文艺报”在思想上和作风上的许多错误。这些错误主要是：对于文艺上的资产阶级错误思想的容忍和投降；对于马克思主义新生力量的轻视和压制；在文艺批评上的粗暴、武断和压制自由讨论的恶劣作风。这些错误的性质是严重的，是违背了马克思主义的立场和党的文艺方针的。
    俞平伯所著的“红楼梦研究”和他近年来所发表的一些关于“红楼梦”的文章，是宣传胡适派资产阶级唯心论观点的错误著作。这些著作对我国古典文学作了严重的歪曲，在群众中间散布了毒素。对于这些著作，“文艺报”不仅没有加以批评，反而在该刊一九五三年第九期上发表了推荐“红楼梦研究”的文章；而在这前后，“文艺报”编辑部对于白盾、李希凡、蓝翎等用马克思主义观点批评俞平伯错误论点的文章，则拒绝刊登或不加理睬。直到李希凡、蓝翎的文章在“文史哲”杂志上发表后，由于读者的建议，才在该刊转载。转载时，编者又加上了贬抑这个批评的重大意义的错误按语。这些事实，说明了“文艺报”在“红楼梦”问题上所犯的错误决不是偶然的。“文艺报”编者们忘记了“文艺报”是一个宣传马克思主义文艺思想的刊物，它有责任去同一切反马克思主义的错误的文艺思想进行斗争，相反地，却甘心拜倒在资产阶级思想前面，甘心去颂扬和袒护反马克思主义的文艺思想。这是不可容忍的。
    “文艺报”编者既然成了资产阶级思想的俘虏，就必然会和马克思主义的新生力量疏远起来，以至于对他们采取资产阶级贵族老爷式的轻视和压制态度。“文艺报”对待青年作家和批评家的态度是傲慢的，缺乏热情的。“文艺报”编辑部在这次检查工作中，发现过去退回的稿件有不少是不该退回的。这些稿子被退回的理由，往往是因为它们批评了某一个“权威”或大名人，而那些写稿者则是
  “小人物”。因此，“文艺报”上刊登的青年作家和批评家的作品和读者来稿越来越少。对于一些为群众所欢迎的、带有新生气息的青年作家的作品，
  “文艺报”很少给予热情的鼓励和支持；在批评这些作品时，常常忽视了这些作品的总的倾向，却动辄用简单的方法和粗暴的态度去挑剔缺点，轻率地否定别人的劳动成果。“文艺报”对白盾、李希凡、蓝翎的态度和今年一月间对李准的小说“不能走那一条路”所采取的冷酷的批评态度，就是最突出的例子。
    “文艺报”一方面向资产阶级错误思想投降，另一方面对于具有进步倾向的文艺作品的批评，又往往采取了粗暴、武断和压制自由讨论的态度。
  “文艺报”在批评工作上，长期以来存在一种自以为是的“权威”思想和否定一切的虚无主义观点，既缺乏实事求是的精神，又缺乏与人为善的同志态度，常常用教条主义的简单公式去批评一篇作品，却不容许别人进行反批评。对于那些基本倾向正确而尚有缺点的作品，不是在热情鼓励下帮助作者克服缺点，而是用吹毛求疵的老爷式的挑剔加以打击。这种粗暴的、武断的批评已给文艺创作带来极大的损害。“文艺报”也曾经宣传过不少错误的理论（如“无冲突论”等），但他们却从来没有对自己发表过和宣传过的错误理论加以批评和纠正。文艺界和读者早已对“文艺报”有意见，但“文艺报”编者们却不正视自己的错误，不重视别人对自己错误的批评，而是采取拒绝批评的态度。他们以为只有他们有批评别人的权利，却没有倾听别人批评的义务。他们错误地以为对自己的缺点和错误公开进行自我批评或接受批评，会有损于刊物的“威信”。这种自以为是的“权威”态度，堵塞了文艺工作上批评和自我批评的空气，阻碍了文艺界自由讨论的健全展开，使“文艺报”丧失了思想斗争的积极组织者的作用，而成为脱离群众的高高在上的官僚主义的刊物了。
      “文艺报”曾经设立过编辑委员会，但许多编辑委员没有能发挥作用，主编对他们缺乏应有的尊重，许多重大问题不和编辑委员们商量，重要稿件也不给编辑委员们看，使编辑委员会成了形同虚设的东西。后来就由主编提议干脆取消编委会了。
    上述一切事实，表明“文艺报”违背了马克思主义的立场和党的文艺方针，违背了集体领导和批评与自我批评的原则。近一年来，“文艺报”所宣传的思想和所采取的做法，有不少是同中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会决议的精神相违背的。
    中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团认为：
  “文艺报”所以产生这些错误，是由于在“文艺报”的编者们身上严重地存在着资产阶级的思想和资产阶级的作风。这是“文艺报”一切错误的主要根源。正是这种资产阶级思想和资产阶级作风，使“文艺报”编者乐于去袒护反马克思主义的文艺思想和资产阶级名人，却经常用贵族老爷式的态度抹杀和压制马克思主义的新生力量。
    应该指出：“文艺报”自创刊以来，是做了不少有益于人民的工作，取得了一定的成绩的。但是，
  “文艺报”编者却把那些成绩看成是他们个人的东西，因此，滋长了一种极端骄傲自满的情绪和腐朽的“权威”思想，这就使“文艺报”更加脱离实际，脱离群众，而群众对“文艺报”的不满也越来越大了。
    “文艺报”所犯的错误，是和中国作家协会主席团对于文艺思想领导的软弱无力和对人民事业缺乏责任心分不开的。中国作家协会主席团接受中国文联的委托领导“文艺报”的工作，却放弃了自己应有的责任，没有经常地认真地去检查“文艺报”的工作，以至未能及时纠正“文艺报”的错误。文学艺术的领导机关大多忙于琐细的事务，很少去研究文艺界存在的思想倾向问题，没有从一九五一年对反动影片“武训传”的批判中认真汲取教训。对资产阶级思想的容忍和投降的错误倾向，在中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团的工作中以及它们所领导的其他刊物和机关中，都或多或少地存在着。中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团在检查“文艺报”的工作以后，必须进一步来检查和改进其本身的领导工作；同时号召全国文艺团体和文艺刊物进行同样的检查并改进工作。
    中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团指出：“文艺报”应该经过这次检查，认真地彻底地改正自己的错误。“文艺报”应该成为真正宣传马克思主义文艺思想，开展健康的有原则性的文艺批评的刊物。它应该对资产阶级的各种错误的文艺思想进行斗争，坚决克服投降主义的倾向；它应该积极扶植马克思主义的新生力量，坚决克服轻视和压制新生力量的倾向；它应该有领导地有计划地开展文艺思想的自由讨论。同时，其他文艺刊物也应该以同样精神来开展文艺批评和自由讨论，保证文学艺术事业能够在马克思主义思想指导下健康地发展，真正担负起为国家社会主义建设事业服务的光荣任务。
    中国文联主席团和中国作家协会主席团联席会议决议：
    一、改组“文艺报”的编辑机构，重新成立编辑委员会，实施集体领导的原则。
    二、责成“文艺报”新的编辑委员会提出办法，坚决克服本决议所指出的错误，端正刊物的编辑方针，使“文艺报”成为具有明确战斗方向和切实作风的刊物，内容应以文艺批评为主，同时对人民的文化艺术生活发表评论和介绍，力求扩大和密切文艺与广大人民生活的联系。
    三、中国文联主席团责成中国作家协会主席团改进对“文艺报”的领导工作。“文艺报”在工作上应与中华人民共和国文化部建立密切的联系。
    四、责成“人民文学”及中国作家协会领导的其他刊物及其地方分会的刊物加强文艺批评工作，并提出开展文艺批评和自由讨论的具体计划。
    五、责成中国作家协会、中国戏剧家协会、中国音乐家协会、中国美术家协会和所属各地分会的机关刊物以及各省市文联所属机关刊物的编辑机构根据本决议的方针进行工作的检查并改进工作。
    六、中国作家协会主席团应在一九五五年春季召开中国作家协会第二次理事会，来讨论改进作家协会的领导工作。
