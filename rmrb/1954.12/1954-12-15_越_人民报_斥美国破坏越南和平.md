Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 14th: The Vietnamese Labor Party's newspaper "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 12th, stating that the US imperialists are the main enemies of the Vietnamese people; they are also the most dangerous enemies of the peace and happiness of the French people, the Southeast Asian people, and the people of the whole world.

The editorial pointed out: The statement issued by the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the memorandum from the Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army to the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission are a serious protest by all the Vietnamese people against the US imperialists, the French colonialists who are sabotaging the ceasefire, and their running dogs' actions in violation of the Geneva Accords. These two documents exposed the treacherous conspiracies of the US imperialists to undermine peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The editorial said: This policy of the US imperialists, the French colonialists who are sabotaging the ceasefire agreement, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is completely contrary to the fundamental interests and aspirations of the Vietnamese people and the people of Laos and Cambodia. The US imperialists and their running dogs are doing their best to undermine peace, plotting to divide the country in two, and scheming to turn South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into their colonies and military bases.

The editorial said that the policy of US imperialism is also completely contrary to the wishes of the French people and the majority of people in French political, economic, and cultural circles, and contrary to the interests and aspirations of the people of Southeast Asian countries. The US imperialists are actively attempting to realize the aggressive goals of the Manila Treaty in South Vietnam, which not only threatens the peace, unification, independence, and democracy of the Vietnamese, Laotian, and Cambodian peoples, but also threatens the sovereignty and security of the peoples of other Southeast Asian countries.

The editorial concluded: The Vietnamese people are determined to wage a resolute and unremitting struggle to smash the treacherous conspiracies of the US imperialists and their running dogs.

    越“人民报”斥美国破坏越南和平
    【新华社十四日讯】据越南通讯社河内讯：越南劳动党机关报“人民报”十二日发表社论说：美帝国主义者是越南人民的主要敌人；他们也是法国人民、东南亚人民和全世界人民的和平和幸福的最危险的敌人。
    社论指出：越南民主共和国外交部长发表的声明和越南人民军总司令致国际监督和监察委员会的备忘录，是全体越南人民对美帝国主义者、破坏停战的法国殖民分子和他们的走狗违反日内瓦协定的行为的严重抗议。这两份文件揭发了美帝国主义者在印度支那和东南亚进行的破坏和平的背信弃义的阴谋。
    社论说：美帝国主义者、破坏停战协定的法国殖民分子和吴庭艳集团的这种政策是完全和越南人民以及老挝和柬埔寨人民的根本利益和愿望相反的。美帝国主义者和它的走狗们尽力破坏和平，阴谋把这个国家分裂为二，并且阴谋把南越和老挝、柬埔寨变成他们的殖民地和军事基地。
    社论说，美帝国主义的政策，也完全违背了法国人民以及法国政治界、经济界、文化界大多数人士的愿望，违背了东南亚各国人民的利益和愿望。美帝国主义者积极地企图在南越实现马尼拉条约的侵略目标，不仅威胁着越南人民、老挝人民以及柬埔寨人民的和平、统一、独立和民主，而且也威胁着东南亚其他国家人民的主权和安全。
    社论最后表示：越南人民决心为粉碎美帝国主义者和他们的走狗们的背信弃义的阴谋而进行坚决的和不懈的斗争。
