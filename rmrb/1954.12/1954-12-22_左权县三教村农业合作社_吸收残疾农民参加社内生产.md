    Agricultural Cooperative in Sanjiao Village, Zuoquan County
    Absorbs Disabled Farmers to Participate in Production
    The Sanjiao Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fokou Township, Zuoquan County, Shanxi Province, has absorbed six households of disabled farmers, including the blind and mute, into the cooperative to participate in production, which has improved their living standards and relatively increased the cooperative's production income.
    Initially, when the Sanjiao Village branch of the Chinese Communist Party proposed organizing these people to join the cooperative and participate in production, cooperative cadres and members thought that these households would add trouble, and some older middle-peasant households were even afraid that they would take advantage of them. In view of this situation, the Party branch convened a Party member meeting to launch a discussion and conscientiously conducted education on the Party's class line in rural work, followed by publicity among the members, so that all members unanimously recognized that only by organizing these households to engage in production can everyone achieve prosperity. After these people joined the cooperative, the cooperative arranged their production according to the specific circumstances. Liu Furong and Zhao Yuqing's families had four elderly people with poor eyesight, so the cooperative bought eighteen pigs and handed them over to the four of them to raise. The mute Bai Laiquan and others were assigned to do some carrying and pickling soil for fertilizer, while the cripples Zhao Erhai and Wang Jinrong were both skilled technicians, so they were assigned to dig, thin seedlings, and weed. In this way, they all had appropriate livelihoods.
    Over the past year, with the leadership and assistance of the agricultural cooperative, these households have fundamentally solved the difficulties in production, and their living standards have been greatly improved. For example, Zhao Yuqing and his wife were short of food and clothing every year before joining the cooperative and needed relief. This year, they earned more than 1,400 work points from raising pigs, and can distribute more than 1,400 catties of grain. In addition to eating, they also have surplus grain to sell. Because these households were responsible for doing a lot of odd jobs, the cooperative could free up a large number of laborers to carry out land processing; at the same time, with the development of sideline production, the cooperative also relatively increased its income.

    左权县三教村农业合作社
    吸收残疾农民参加社内生产
    山西省左权县佛口乡三教村农业生产合作社，吸收六户瞎、哑等有残疾的农民入社参加生产，使他们的生活水平得到提高，同时也相对地增加了社内的生产收入。
    起初，中共三教村支部提出组织这些人入社参加生产时，社干部和社员认为这些户入社是增加麻烦，一些老中农户更怕他们占自己的便宜。党支部根据这一情况，召开党员大会展开讨论，认真地进行了党在农村工作中的阶级路线的教育，接着又在社员中进行了宣传，使全体社员一致认识到只有组织这些户进行生产，才能达到大家富裕。这些人入社后，社内根据具体情况分别安排了他们的生产。刘福荣和赵玉清两户四个老人眼睛不好，社内便买了十八只猪，交由他们四人喂养，哑子白来全等二人专门做些担挑和熏土沤肥等工作，跛子赵二孩和王金荣两人都是技术能手，便分配他们刨地、间苗、除草等工作，这样，他们便都有了适当的营生。
    一年来，这些户在农业社的领导和帮助下，已根本解决了生产中的困难，生活水平大大提高。如赵玉清老俩口入社前年年短吃少穿，需要救济，今年养猪共得了一千四百多个劳动工分，可分粮一千四百多斤，除食用外，还有余粮出卖。由于这些户负责做了很多零活，社内就可腾出大批劳动力进行土地加工；同时，随着副业生产的开展，社内也相对地增加了收入。　（王建华）
