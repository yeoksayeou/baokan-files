Jiangxi peasants are strengthening field management of rapeseed.

The rapeseed planting area in Jiangxi Province has reached more than 3.3 million mu, completing more than 60% of the plan, exceeding last year's actual rapeseed planting area by more than 700,000 mu. Currently, farmers in areas with later planting are rushing to plant spicy rapeseed (highly cold-resistant) and transplanting seedlings by carrying water, striving to complete the province's rapeseed planting plan for this year.

The rapeseed seedlings sown around the Beginning of Winter have grown to three or four inches tall. The 583,800 mu of rapeseed planted in the Jiujiang Special District are generally growing well. The broad masses of peasants, filled with joy, are weeding, killing insects, and applying fertilizer in the rapeseed fields. In the third district of Jiujiang County, driven by agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups, many peasants go to the fields to weed every day, completing the weeding plan for more than 4,200 mu of rapeseed in five days.

    江西农民加强油菜田间管理
    江西省油菜播种面积已达三百三十余万亩，完成计划百分之六十以上，比去年油菜实种面积超过七十余万亩。目前，播种较晚地区的农民，正在抢种辣油菜（耐寒性强）和挑水移栽，争取完成全省今年油菜播种计划。
    立冬前后下种的油菜苗已长出三四寸高。九江专区播种的五十八万三千八百多亩油菜，普遍生长良好，广大农民正满怀喜悦心情，在油菜田里锄草、灭虫、施肥。九江县三区在农业社互助组带动下，每天都有很多农民下田锄草，五天内完成了四千二百多亩油菜的锄草计划。（本报江西记者站）
