Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: Recent U.S. propaganda reveals a sign that the U.S. is brewing a new conspiracy to undermine peace in Indochina.

	Just after the U.S., British, and French foreign ministers' meeting in Paris, the United States International News Service issued a dispatch from Paris on the 18th. This dispatch quoted so-called "highly reliable sources" as saying: "If the Communists launch a full-scale aggressive military offensive to conquer South Vietnam, the United States will retaliate with naval and air forces." The message also explained that the "clear implication" of this statement is that U.S. naval and air forces will attack supply lines running from China to North Vietnam. However, the same message also admitted that "there is no reason" to believe that the so-called "Communist offensive" is even "in the planning stages."

	Why would the U.S. propaganda machine trot out the old tune of a "Communist offensive," which it itself does not believe, at this time and spread provocative rhetoric about "retaliation"? Those familiar with U.S. propaganda point out that this is the U.S. seeking a pretext for its own intervention.

	The real threat to peace in Indochina has always been the U.S. itself. After the U.S. violated the Geneva Accords by including South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into the scope of the Southeast Asia military aggression bloc, it dispatched Collins to South Vietnam to prepare to take over training the puppet army from France and strengthen the puppet army's combat effectiveness. The U.S. also instructed the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to take fascist measures, plotting to undermine the free general elections stipulated by the Geneva Accords, and preparing to turn South Vietnam into a base for the U.S. to launch new aggressive adventures. While actively carrying out these war preparations activities that clearly violate the Geneva Accords, the U.S. believes it is necessary to divert people's attention from its new conspiracy by shouting about the "danger of a Communist offensive."

	A Reuters dispatch on the same day quoted "well-informed sources" as revealing that the U.S. also intends to ask members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to intervene in Indochina. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles announced at a press conference in Washington on the 21st that it has been decided "in principle" to convene a meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization at the end of February next year. Prior to this, there had been many reports that one of the main purposes of this meeting was to discuss how to intervene in Indochina. It seems that the U.S. also intends to assign roles to Britain, France, and other member countries of the Southeast Asia aggression bloc in its new conspiracy to intervene in Indochina.

### 美国阴谋利用东南亚集团干涉印度支那

    美国阴谋利用东南亚集团干涉印度支那
    【新华社二十二日讯】最近美国宣传中显露出一种迹象，美国正酝酿着破坏印度支那和平的新阴谋。
    恰恰在美、英、法三国外长巴黎会谈之后，美国国际新闻社十八日从巴黎发出了一条消息。这条消息引用所谓“非常可靠人士”的话说：“假如共产党发动全面的侵略性的军事进攻来征服南越，美国将以海、空军进行报复”。消息还解释说，这一说法的“清楚的含意”是，美国海空军将袭击从中国通到北越地区的供应线。可是就是这同一条消息也承认，“没有理由”认为所谓“共产党的进攻”甚至“在计划中”。
    为什么美国宣传机关要在这个时候搬出它自己也不相信的“共产党进攻”的老调来，并且散布什么“报复”的挑衅言论呢？熟悉美国宣传的人们指出：这是美国为自己进行干涉寻找借口。
    真正威胁着印度支那和平的一直就是美国自己。美国在违反日内瓦协定把南越、老挝、柬埔寨划进东南亚军事侵略集团的范围后，派遣了柯林斯前往南越，准备从法国手里接管训练伪军并加强伪军的战斗力。美国还指使吴廷艳集团采取法西斯措施，策划破坏日内瓦协定所规定的自由普选，准备把南越变成美国发动新的侵略冒险的根据地。在积极进行这些明显地违反日内瓦协议的战争准备活动时，美国认为有必要以“共产党进攻的危险”的叫嚷来转移人们对它的新阴谋的注意。
    路透社在同一天发出的消息引述“消息灵通人士”的话透露，美国还打算要求东南亚条约组织的成员来对印度支那进行干涉。美国国务卿杜勒斯在二十一日华盛顿记者招待会上宣布：“原则上”已经决定明年二月底召开东南亚条约组织会议。在此以前，已经有许多消息说：这次会议的主要目的之一就是商讨如何干涉印度支那。看来美国还打算在干涉印度支那的新阴谋中给英、法及东南亚侵略集团其他成员国家派定角色。
