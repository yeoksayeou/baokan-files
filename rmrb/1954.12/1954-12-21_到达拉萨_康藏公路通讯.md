    Arriving in Lhasa
    --Communication from the Kangzang Highway
    Our Newspaper Reporter: Shen Shi
    On December 7th, after the car passed over Gongbu Bala, the last great mountain on the Kangzang Highway, we arrived at Lhasa, the highway's terminal station.

    In these days, we couldn't suppress the excitement and exhilaration in our hearts. The road-building heroes built this highway on the vast plateau, connecting the interior of the motherland and the border regions of the motherland more closely. The distance from the interior to the border has been greatly shortened. People will no longer calculate the journey from Lhasa to the interior in months, nor will they be hindered by thousands of mountains and rivers, and layers of high mountains; on this modern transportation line of more than 2,250 kilometers, people can make a round trip in just one month.

    This is a unique, arduous and grand project in the world. After we left Ya'an by car, we climbed onto the "Roof of the World," climbed over twenty great mountains with undulating peaks and precipitous cliffs, crossed many dangerous river valleys such as the Dadu River, Jinsha River, Lancang River, and Nujiang River with turbulent waves, and also passed through many hundreds of miles of primitive forests, boundless grasslands, and swampy areas. The average altitude of the entire Kangzang Highway is above 3,000 meters, and its highest point, the summit of Que'er Mountain, is 5,300 meters high, which is higher than the summit of Japan's famous Mount Fuji. Although there are some very long highways in the world, the average altitude is not so high. As long as you climb any big mountain by car, there will always be a cloud of mist under your feet, and there will always be undulating snow-capped mountains in front of the car, you will feel that you are crawling between the clouds and the snow-capped mountains.

    This is a great initiative of the people of New China to conquer nature. To build this highway, it is necessary to overcome many special difficulties, and to have a group of people who truly have the greatest courage, the most tenacious perseverance, and can sacrifice themselves at any time in the face of the construction cause of the motherland, and our People's Liberation Army and workers are such people. Areas above 3,000 meters above sea level on the Kangzang Plateau are already snow lines. In these places, even in summer, it is often covered with white snow, the climate is severely cold, the air is thin, and breathing is difficult. However, after several years of training, our People's Liberation Army is not only an invincible fighting team, but also an excellent engineering team. They worked all night in the freezing snow, they often ran dozens of miles to cut firewood to thaw the frozen soil, and their hands and feet were frostbitten by wind and snow, but they still persisted in opening mountains and digging soil. The heroes, from the windy spring to the winter when ice and snow blocked the mountains, day and night, split this mountain, and climbed another peak, again and again removed tents from mountains above 4,000 meters above sea level, and set up tents again in river valleys or forests. Thousands of steel drills were worn down in their hands, and the shovels were sharpened like sickles. It is these people who fought on the Kangzang Plateau, digging cubic meter after cubic meter of soil, blasting away cubic meter after cubic meter of hard rock, and then using shovels of gravel and baskets of soil to pave the road to Lhasa, to the border of the motherland. The heroes have left a glorious page in the history of mankind's conquest of nature. The earthwork and stone excavated for the roadbed alone amounted to 29 million cubic meters. If a canal fifteen meters wide, three meters deep, and one thousand three hundred li long were to be opened, the earthwork and stone excavated would not be more than this. The industrious and brave people of the motherland have also completed many great construction projects in the past, but they were completed after many dynasties. The Great Wall was connected after more than a dozen dynasties, but this highway, in the hands of the people of New China, took less than five years from the start of construction to the opening of the entire line.

    Friends, when you ride on this wide and flat road, and climb up the Que'er Mountain, you will see many wooden signs beside the road with the words "Dangerous Road Along the Mountain" written on them. You will be as excited as we are, marveling at how our heroes split this mountain in half and opened this road in the cliffs of dozens or even hundreds of feet high. This is what our heroes conquered with perseverance, wisdom, and blood and sweat. When you pass the Nujiang steel bridge, which is as wide as the road, you will also marvel at how our road-building heroes opened bridgeheads and roads on cliffs hundreds of feet high on both sides, and built this steel bridge over the turbulent Nujiang River! But these are not the most dangerous projects. When you continue to drive west, you will reach the past rubber road, which seemed to trap the car when it passed over it; now the section of road the car is traveling on is where the heroes dug out the silt one shovel at a time, all the way to the hard bottom, then filled it with stones from the bottom to the top, covered it with wooden rafts cut from the forest, and then covered the wooden rafts with sand and soil, which allowed you to pass smoothly. You will also pass through many quicksand areas. In the past, when building roads next to quicksand mountains, sand kept flowing down from above, and the sand was mixed with stones, which could not be dug out. Our soldiers and civilians often wore iron buckets to dig quicksand. Now, what you see are rows of wooden piles on the sand slope, and stone walls built at the junctions of quicksand and road surfaces. In this way, quicksand was conquered by the infinitely wise heroes. After passing Zhamu in the Bomi area, you will suddenly see a bare patch of sand and soil and small hills of huge rocks in the river valley of the mountains and forests, and only half of the mountain peak next to the small hills is left. This is the glacier area. The glaciers here have continuously collapsed, and after the ice layer dozens of meters thick on the top of the mountain melted, a large amount of rocks, ice cubes, and sand and mud, together with floods, poured down from the high mountains, turning small streams into deep gullies, cutting off thick trees in the middle, or washing them away without a trace. Some of the newly built roadbeds were submerged by sand and stones, some were swept away by floods, and some bridges were broken. However, the heroes' selfless labor overwhelmed the power of nature, roadbeds and bridges were built on glaciers, and the most difficult obstacle to the west of Lhasa was broken.

    In the great construction of conquering nature, the difficulties experienced by the heroes are unimaginable. There were no houses to live in on the mountains, so they set up tents on the ice and snow, and the tents were sometimes crushed by heavy snow or blown away by strong winds. When supplies were difficult, they couldn't even get enough to eat. Because the air was thin and the boiling point was low, they sometimes ate raw rice. However, all the difficulties of the natural environment such as hail and snow were subdued in front of the heroes. Our heroes said: "Only people overcome difficulties, no difficulties overcome people." One soldier said: "It is difficult for anyone to give us a good explanation of whether it is bitter or not. Of course, there is a little bitterness, but there is a lot of sweetness in our bitterness! The most precious action to love the motherland is construction. Only through construction can the motherland become prosperous and strong. So to speak, there is a lot of sweetness in our present suffering! As long as there is this sweetness, our suffering is nothing."

    It is these heroes who have such heroic spirit that they built this heroic highway on the "Roof of the World."

    In these days, the people on the Kangzang Plateau couldn't hold back their joyful feelings. Under the Serqila Mountain, we saw people singing and dancing wildly around the glowing fire. Next to the Bahe Bridge, people were also singing loudly in the bright moonlight. Along the highway, when the Tibetan people saw cars passing by their doorsteps, they waved and cheered in groups. Old people came to the highway with crutches, with excited tears in their eyes, and gently touched the car with their foreheads. At the end of this heroic highway, in this beautiful city of Lhasa, people are joyfully welcoming the full opening of the highway.

    到达拉萨
    ——康藏公路通讯
    本报记者　沈石
    十二月七日，汽车翻过了康藏公路最后一座大山工布巴拉以后，我们就来到这条公路的终点站拉萨了。
    在这些日子里，我们忍不住心头的激动和兴奋。筑路英雄们在辽阔的高原上修起了这条公路，使祖国的内地和祖国的边疆更紧密的连接起来。从内地到边疆的距离大大地缩短了。人们再不会以几个月来计算从拉萨到内地的日程，再不会受到千山万水、重重高岭的阻挡；在这条二千二百五十多公里长的现代化的交通线上，人们只要一个月的时间就可以走一趟来回。
    这是一个举世无双、艰巨而浩大的工程。我们乘车离开雅安以后，就爬上了“世界屋脊”，爬过了峰峦起伏、悬崖绝壁的二十座大山，跨过了怒涛汹涌的大渡河、金沙江、澜沧江、怒江等许多险峻的江谷，还穿过了许多数百里长的原始森林、无边的草原和沼泽地带。康藏公路全线平均海拔在三千公尺以上，它的最高点雀儿山顶有五千三百公尺高，比日本著名的富士山顶还高。世界上虽然有些很长的公路，但平均海拔都没有这样高。只要你乘车爬上任何一座大山，在你的脚下总是一片云雾，在车前面总有起伏的雪山，你会觉得自己是在云雾和雪山间爬行。
    这是新中国人民战胜大自然的伟大创举。要修筑这条公路，需要克服许多特殊的困难，需要有一批真正具有最大的勇敢，具有最坚强的毅力，和在祖国的建设事业面前随时可以牺牲自己的人，而我们的人民解放军和职工们就是这样的人。康藏高原海拔三千公尺以上的地方，已是雪线了。在这些地方，就是夏天也常常盖满了白雪，气候严寒，空气稀薄，呼吸困难。但是，经过几年来的锻炼，我们的人民解放军，已不仅是一支英勇无敌的战斗队，而且是一支优秀的工程队了。他们彻夜在冰天雪地里施工，他们为挖掘冻土，常常跑到数十里外去砍柴消冻，他们的手脚被风雪冻裂也照样坚持开山挖土。英雄们从卷着大风的春天，到冰雪封山的冬天，日日夜夜，劈开了这座山，又登上了另一座高峰，一次又一次地从海拔四千公尺以上的高山上拆掉帐篷，在河谷上或者森林里又架起帐篷。千万根钢钎在他们手里磨秃了，铁锹磨得像镰刀一样。就是这些战斗在康藏高原的人们，挖着一立方一立方的土，炸去一立方一立方的坚石，再用一挑一挑的碎石，一筐一筐的土，才把公路铺到拉萨，铺到祖国的边疆。英雄们在人类征服自然的历史上留下了光辉的一页。光是他们所挖的路基土方和石方，就有二千九百万方，要是开一条十五公尺宽、三公尺深、一千三百里长的运河，挖出的土方石方也不过是这些。勤劳勇敢的祖国人民，在过去也曾经完成过许多伟大的建筑工程，但那是经历了多少朝代才完成的。万里长城是经过了十几个朝代才连接在一起，而这条公路在新中国人民手里，从开工到全线通车，只用了不到五年时间。
    朋友们，当你乘车在这条宽阔平坦的大路上驰行，在爬上雀儿山的路途中，你会看到公路旁边许多木牌上写着“傍山险路”的字样，你就会和我们一样的激动，惊叹着我们的英雄们怎样把这座山劈成了两半，在数十丈、甚至数百丈高的悬崖绝壁中开出了这条公路。这是我们英雄们用毅力，用智慧，用血汗才征服它的。当你走过和大路一样宽阔的怒江钢桥的时候，你也会惊叹我们筑路英雄们怎样在两岸都是百丈高的峭壁上，开了桥头和路面，在汹涌的怒江上架起了这座钢桥！但是这些还不是最险峻的工程。当你乘车继续向西驰行，就到了过去的橡皮路，当初汽车从上面通过时，它好像陷井一样把汽车陷下去；现在汽车所走的这段路，是英雄们用坚韧的劳动，一锹一锹地把淤地挖掉，一直挖到硬底，然后从底到面，全部垫上石头，垫上从森林里砍来的木排，再在木排上面垫上沙土，这才使你平平稳稳地通过去了。你也会经过许多流沙地带。当初在流沙山旁开路，沙就从上面不断地往下流，沙里还杂着石头，挖也挖不尽，我们的战士和民工常常顶着铁皮桶去挖流沙。现在，你看到的是在沙坡上的一排排木桩，在流沙和路面相接连的地方，打起了一道道的石头墙。就这样，流沙被智慧无穷的英雄们征服了。过了波密地区的扎木以后，你突然会看到在群山丛林的河谷里，有一片光秃秃的沙土和巨石堆成的小丘，小丘旁边的山峰也只剩了一半，这就是冰川地带。这里的冰川曾经不断地崩溃，山顶上几十公尺厚的冰层融化以后，大量的石头、冰块和沙泥，同洪水一起，从高山上直泻下来，将小溪变成深沟，把粗大的树木拦腰截断，或者冲得无影无纵。刚修起的路基有的被沙石淹没了，有的被洪水卷走了；有的桥梁也被打断。但是英雄们奋不顾身的劳动，压倒了大自然的威力，路基和桥梁在冰川上建筑起来，西通拉萨最困难的一关被打通了。
    在征服大自然的伟大建设中，英雄们所经受的困难，人们是难以想像的。山上没有房子住，他们就在冰雪上搭帐篷，帐篷有时被大雪压塌或被大风刮走。供应困难的时候，连饭也吃不饱。因为空气稀薄，沸点低，有时吃生饭。但是，所有冰雹风雪等自然环境的艰难，都在英雄们面前慑服了。我们的英雄们说：“只有人克服困难，没有困难克服人的。”有一位战士这样说：“苦与不苦，谁也难得给我们一个很好的解释。苦，当然有一点，但是我们这个苦里却有着很多的甜呢！爱祖国，最宝贵的行动莫过于建设，只有建设，祖国才能繁荣富强。所以说，我们眼前的苦中，有着很多的甜呀！只要有这个甜在，我们的苦就算不了什么。”
    就是这些英雄们有了这样的英雄气概，才在“世界屋脊”上修起了这条英雄的公路。
    在这些日子里，康藏高原上的人们怎么也按不住欢腾的心情。在色齐拉山下，我们看到人们围着荧荧的火光高歌狂舞。在巴河桥旁，人们也在明亮的月光下高声歌唱。在公路的沿线，藏族人民看到汽车驰过他们家门口时，成群结队地招手欢呼。老人们拄着拐杖来到公路上，含着兴奋的眼泪，用头额轻轻地碰碰汽车。在这条英雄的公路的终点，在这美丽的拉萨城里，人们正喜气洋洋地迎接公路的全线通车。
