Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 19th: An article by Torkunov in "Pravda" entitled "Infringement on the Territorial Integrity of China" states that the U.S. occupation of China's Taiwan has greatly intensified the current international situation. The article says that the U.S. imperialists have no reason whatsoever to occupy the island of Taiwan, which has always been Chinese territory. American newspapers, and not just American newspapers, are issuing completely fabricated arguments, insisting that the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," like the Paris Accords, is for defensive purposes, and even saying that this treaty is in line with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. The practitioners of "power politics" resort to such propaganda tricks in order to deceive public opinion and attempt, under the guise of defending peace, to take many aggressive measures that greatly intensify the international situation.

The article then points out that there is growing unease in Britain about British policy in Far Eastern affairs. The article says that some newspapers and many prominent political figures have severely condemned Sir Pierson Dixon, the chief British representative to the United Nations, who recently openly threatened People's China that if the People's Republic of China were to exercise its sovereignty to liberate Taiwan, it would go to war with it. As a result of Sir Pierson Dixon’s remarks, British diplomacy has been placed in an extremely awkward position.

The article says that the magazine "U.S. News & World Report" published a very revealing article that thoroughly exposes the true U.S. aims in the Far East. This article suggests imposing a blockade on China in order to make China release the Americans convicted of espionage. The magazine cited an example of the U.S. sending a force of 6,000 men in the 19th century to "support" some Americans in Beijing. Needless to say, this was just a hypocritical pretext for invading a country and forcing it to accept conditions of enslavement.

The article points out that those who like to send navies to occupy other countries' territories have forgotten that it is not the 19th century now, and the era of foreign powers enslaving China has become history, an era that is gone forever. The short-sightedness and arrogance of the imperialists have suffered defeats in China more than once. It is time for them to understand that a people who have tasted the fruits of freedom and have become masters of their own land can never be conquered.

The article concludes by saying that the Soviet people support the noble and just cause of the great Chinese people and support the Chinese people's determination to exercise their sovereignty to liberate Taiwan. The Soviet people firmly believe that truth will surely prevail and that Taiwan will return to the embrace of the great motherland—the People's Republic of China. Let the enemies of peace be angry and furious! People's China is confidently advancing along its correct path!

### 苏联“真理报”发表专文  斥责美国侵占台湾加剧国际紧张局势

    苏联“真理报”发表专文
    斥责美国侵占台湾加剧国际紧张局势
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：托尔库诺夫在“真理报”上发表的一篇题为“对中国领土完整的侵犯”的文章说，美国占领中国的台湾使目前国际的局势大大紧张起来。文章说，美国帝国主义者没有任何理由占领历来就是中国领土的台湾岛。美国报纸，而且不仅是美国报纸，发出彻头彻尾捏造的论调，硬说美蒋“共同防御条约”和巴黎协定一样是以防御为目的的，还说什么这个条约是符合联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的。“实力政策”的奉行者之所以要玩这类的宣传花招，是为了要迷惑舆论，并且企图在高谈保卫和平的幌子下，采取许多使国际局势大为紧张的侵略措施。
    文章接着指出，英国国内对英国在远东事务方面的政策日益感到不安。文章说，一些报纸和许多著名的政治活动家严厉谴责英国驻联合国的首席代表纳丁，纳丁在不久以前公开威胁人民中国说，如果中华人民共和国要行使解放台湾的主权，就要和它作战。由于纳丁发出了这样的言论，英国外交陷入了极为难堪的窘境。
    文章说，“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志这一期刊载了一篇十分有味道的文章，这篇文章彻底地暴露出美国对远东的真正目的。这篇文章建议向中国实行封锁，以使中国释放因间谍活动被判罪的美国人。这个杂志援引了一个实例，说美国在十九世纪曾派遣一支有六千人的队伍来“支持”在北京的一些美国人。不用说，这只是侵入一个国家并且强使它接受奴役条件的一个虚伪借口而已。
    文章指出，但是，喜欢派遣海军来占领别国领土的人们忘记了现在并不是十九世纪，外来的力量奴役中国的时代已经成为历史，这个时代已经一去不复返了。帝国主义者的目光短浅和妄自尊大，不只一次地在中国遭到了失败。现在是时候了，他们应该了解：已经尝到自由的果实和已经成为自己土地上的主人的人民是绝不可能被征服的。
    文章最后说，苏联人民支持伟大的中国人民的高尚和正义的事业，支持中国人民行使解放台湾的主权的决心。苏联人民坚信：真理必定胜利，台湾将重回伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国的怀抱。让和平的敌人愤怒和发狂罢！人民中国满怀信心地沿着自己正确的道路前进！
