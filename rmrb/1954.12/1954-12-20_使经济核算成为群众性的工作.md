    Make Economic Accounting a Mass Movement

    After learning from the advanced Soviet experience and implementing a system combining team/group cost accounting with labor emulation, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's various factories and mines have seen significant effects in conserving raw materials, improving product quality, reducing waste, increasing production, and raising labor productivity. The No. 4 Plate Mill began implementing this method in April, and in the second and third quarters combined, it accumulated over 4 billion yuan more for the state than in the first quarter.

    The most fundamental characteristic of this experience is that every day, all the various targets that each team/group should complete—output, quality, raw material consumption quotas, etc.—and the economic value of each target are communicated to all workers, and the results of implementation are calculated and announced daily. In this way, every worker and relevant personnel know every day how much they have accumulated or wasted for the state; and if there is waste, what target was not met that caused it. This can motivate everyone to strive every day to comprehensively fulfill the various targets set by the state and to strive for greater economic results.

    This is a very good experience, and we should value it and promote it.

    Promoting this advanced experience will closely integrate one of the most important tasks in realizing socialist industrialization—the task of accumulating construction funds—with the daily labor of millions of people. Over the years, we have repeatedly launched campaigns for increased production and thrift in enterprises, and each time we have accumulated huge amounts of funds for the state beyond the plan. These campaigns have proven that the broad masses of workers are highly motivated and have great power to accumulate construction funds for the state. After conducting education on the General Line, the consciousness of the workers has been further raised. As long as we are good at organizing this enthusiasm, they will surely create achievements exceeding those of the past and difficult for people to anticipate. However, because many of our enterprises currently do not pay attention to cost and financial management, and the economic accounting system is not sound, the masses cannot regularly know the economic results of their labor, do not know what factors constitute the cost of the enterprise, and do not know the specific ways to save and accumulate funds. They can only know a general account long after a month, a quarter, or even a year has passed, and only then know whether their enterprise has lost or made money for the state. If they lost money, they also do not know what responsibility they should bear in the middle, and since time has passed, even if they want to remedy it, it is too late. Promoting the method of combining team/group cost accounting with labor emulation can overcome this drawback. The masses will clearly know every day what aspects they should work on to create wealth for the state, and they will consider the economic effects of every job they do, consciously grasp the key links of increasing production and thrift. In this way, the struggle to strive for super-plan accumulation can run through the daily labor of the broad masses of workers, making increased production and thrift a regular mass movement.

    Promoting this advanced experience will also establish a solid and reliable foundation for the comprehensive fulfillment of the state plan. Our current situation is: the state formulates comprehensive plans every year in the industrial sector—output plans, cost plans, profit plans, labor productivity plans, etc.; various industrial ministries, various bureaus, and various factories and mines also have such plans. However, in many enterprises, these planned targets have not met the workers who are directly responsible for achieving these targets; even if the plan is announced to the workers, most of them only announce the output plan. Under such circumstances, it is obviously very difficult to ensure the comprehensive fulfillment of the state plan. The tendency to only care about output and disregard quality, safety, and cost, which is common in enterprises and has not been overcome for a long time, is inseparable from this shortcoming in planning work. And promoting the method of combining team/group cost accounting with labor emulation, and comprehensively explaining the production plan to the workers, will facilitate mobilizing them to strive for the comprehensive fulfillment of the plan and can overcome the above problems.

    Promoting this advanced experience can also regularize labor emulation. The fundamental reason why labor emulation in many enterprises cannot be regularized is that there are no specific scientific competition goals and evaluation criteria. We know that the purpose of labor emulation is to ensure the comprehensive completion and strive for the over-fulfillment of the state plan, and the only standard for evaluating the merits of competition is the good or bad completion of the plan. If the competitors do not know what targets they should complete that day, and do not know how the completion results are, then it is difficult for us to imagine that the competition in this enterprise is being carried out every day. And promoting the method of combining team/group cost accounting with labor emulation can make up for this deficiency.

    Promoting this advanced experience can also promote the improvement of various aspects of work in enterprises, and continuously open up new sources of potential strength. Because the plan figures and actual completion figures of each team/group (even each individual), and each target every day are clear. Analyzing and studying those figures that have not completed the plan can find shortcomings in the work and improve them; comparing and analyzing those figures that have been completed best can find advanced experience, consolidate and promote it.

    Some people believe that the planning work and various data of many enterprises in our country are not completely accurate at present, so there are no conditions to promote this advanced experience. Of course, this view reflects the difficult side of the work; but even in these enterprises, it is not completely impossible to promote this method. Because the team/group cost accounting currently implemented by Anshan Iron and Steel is not a comprehensive economic accounting system for the team/group, but only issues several main indicators according to the specific situation of each team/group, and only calculates the economic effects of these main indicators. This can be done as long as fixed teams/groups are divided, there are daily operation plans, raw material consumption quotas and various technical and economic quotas, and there are original records. If the original records, operation plans, and quotas are not accurate, they can be gradually improved during the promotion process. In terms of steps, we can also start with the main work sections and several main indicators first, and then gradually expand and deepen. Some enterprises are in continuous production and cannot calculate the results separately by team/group, so they can also calculate by equipment (such as blast furnaces, steelmaking furnaces). Some processes have a very long production cycle and cannot calculate the results by day, so the completion of each indicator can also be checked according to the production cycle (such as a kiln of bricks that takes 30 days to burn, so 30 days is a cycle). In short, although the production characteristics of each enterprise are different, the basic spirit of this advanced experience is applicable.

    There is also a prevalent argument among some leading cadres in enterprises: "Now our central work is plan management and technical management, and cost and financial work can only be grasped in the next step." This argument actually reflects that these comrades do not attach importance to or are not good at combining their work focus with the overall leadership of the enterprise; it also reflects that they have not truly realized the serious significance of the financial issue in realizing socialist industrialization. The experience of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 4 Plate Mill has proven that the above argument is wrong. In the first half of this year, the No. 4 Plate Mill mainly focused on the responsibility system, and in the second half, it mainly strengthened technical management. The leading cadres of the No. 4 Plate Mill were all workers, with low education levels and insufficient knowledge of economic accounting, but they successfully promoted this experience, turning themselves from a loss-making enterprise into a profitable one.

    Of course, it is also wrong to take the promotion of this advanced experience too lightly. To promote this method, certain preparations must be made. First, the leading cadres of the enterprise and relevant functional institutions should conduct a relatively comprehensive analysis of the financial costs of the enterprise, and find out the main factors affecting costs and the main aspects of waste. In this way, we can clearly grasp the main problems that should be solved in cost accounting. At the same time, using such analysis to educate the masses can increase the masses' knowledge of cost work, improve their understanding of the important significance of reducing costs, and clarify the direction of efforts to reduce costs and comprehensively fulfill the state plan. Second, according to the requirements of comprehensively fulfilling the state plan, the main indicators that should be determined for each team/group, and how to correctly calculate the economic value of these indicators, also require careful research. Finally, according to the requirements of economic accounting, the old original records may have incomplete, inapplicable, or untimely aspects, and necessary rectification and improvement are also required.

    In addition to doing these preparatory work and conducting full political mobilization among the workers, special attention should be paid to mobilizing cost and financial personnel when promoting this advanced experience. Because to do a good job in team/group accounting, to determine the calculation methods of various indicators and economic effects reasonably, accurately, and easily understood by workers, to ensure that the execution results can be settled in a timely manner, announced in a timely manner, and to conduct regular analysis of various accounting figures, to find problems from them, and to provide the leadership with information to improve work, it is impossible to achieve without the creative labor, high sense of responsibility, and initiative of cost and financial personnel.

    When promoting this advanced experience, it must also be coordinated with the correct wage system and reward system to ensure the implementation of the economic accounting system from the perspective of material interests and promote the continuous upsurge of labor emulation. If this issue is ignored, this advanced experience is not easy to achieve and consolidate.

    When promoting this experience, we must strictly prevent localism and partial viewpoints that only start from the economic interests of the enterprise in terms of guiding ideology. We must firmly remember that we are socialist enterprises, and our economic accounting must be and can only be economic accounting from the national point of view. Only starting from the profitability of the unit, not organizing production according to the varieties needed by the state and the people, unwilling to manufacture new products, not cherishing national resources, and only wanting to take shortcuts with little effort and large output value, these are all reflections of bourgeois business thinking and must be resolutely opposed.

    Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in the "Government Work Report" that according to the planned indicators for 1954, as long as the production cost of central and local state-owned industries is reduced by 1%, it can save the state 840 billion yuan every year; as long as labor productivity is increased by 1%, it can increase production by 1.6 trillion yuan every year. Let us strive to learn from the advanced experience of Soviet socialist enterprise management, and better organize the strength and wisdom of the broad masses of workers, and accumulate more funds for the country.

### 使经济核算成为群众性的工作

    使经济核算成为群众性的工作
    鞍山钢铁公司部分厂矿学习苏联先进经验，实行班组节约核算和劳动竞赛相结合的办法以后，在节约原材料、提高产品质量、减少废品、增加产量、提高劳动生产率等方面，起了很大的作用。中板厂四月份开始实行这个办法，第二季和第三季合计比第一季多给国家积累了四十多亿元。
    这个经验的最基本的特点就是每一天把每一个班组应该完成的各项指标——产量、质量、原材料消耗定额等等，以及每一项指标的经济价值，告诉全体职工，并且每天计算、公布执行的结果。这样，便使每个工人以及有关的人员每天都知道自己给国家积累了或是浪费了多少；如果浪费了，又是由于那一个指标没有完成所造成的。这就能推动大家每天都为全面完成国家规定的各项指标而斗争，为争取更大的经济效果而斗争。
    这是一个很好的经验，我们应该重视它，推广它。
    推行这个先进经验，将使我们实现社会主义工业化的最重要的任务之一——积累建设资金的任务，和千百万群众的日常劳动紧密地结合起来。历年来，我们在企业中曾多次发动了增产节约运动，每一次都为国家超计划积累了巨量的资金。这些运动证明了广大的职工对为国家积累建设资金的积极性非常高，力量也非常大。进行总路线教育之后，职工群众的觉悟更加提高了，只要我们善于把这种热情组织起来，他们一定会创造出超过以往的、为人们所难于预料的成绩。但是，由于目前我们很多企业不重视成本财务管理，经济核算制度也不健全，群众并不能经常知道自己劳动的经济效果，不知道企业的成本是由那些因素构成的，不知道节约和积累资金的具体途径。他们只能在一个月、一季、甚至一年过去很久以后，才知道一笔笼统的总账，才知道自己的企业是给国家赔了钱还是赚了钱。如果是赔了，也弄不清自己在这中间应负的责任，而且事过景迁，即使想补救也来不及了。推行了班组节约核算和劳动竞赛相结合的办法，就可以克服这种弊病，群众就每天都清楚地知道应该从那方面努力去为国家创造财富，就会从经济效果上来考虑自己的每一件工作，自觉地掌握增产节约的主要环节。这样，争取超计划积累的斗争就能贯串到广大职工每一天的劳动中去，使增产节约变成了经常的群众运动。
    推行这个先进经验，还将给全面完成国家计划树立坚实可靠的基础。我们目前的情况是：国家每年在工业方面都制订了全面的计划——产量计划、成本计划、利润计划、劳动生产率计划等；各个工业部、各个管理局、各个工厂矿山也都有这样的计划。但是，在许多企业中，这些计划指标却没有同直接负责实现这些指标的工人见面；即或向工人宣布计划，多半也只是宣布产量计划。在这种情况下，要保证全面完成国家计划，显然就有很大的困难。目前企业中普遍存在而长期未能克服的只顾产量，不顾质量、安全和成本的偏向，和计划工作中存在的这个缺点是分不开的。而推行班组节约核算和劳动竞赛相结合的办法，向工人们全面地交代清楚生产计划，就便于动员他们为全面完成计划而奋斗，就可以克服以上的毛病。
    推行这个先进经验，还可以使劳动竞赛经常化。现在有许多企业的劳动竞赛不能经常，其根本原因之一就是没有具体的科学的竞赛目标和评比标准。我们知道，劳动竞赛的目的是保证全面地完成和争取超额完成国家计划，评定竞赛成绩优劣的唯一标准也就是计划完成的好坏。如果竞赛者不知道自己这一天应该完成那些指标，也不知道完成的结果怎样，那么，我们很难想像这个企业中的竞赛会是每天在进行着的。而推行了班组节约核算和劳动竞赛相结合的办法，就可以补足这方面的缺陷。
    推行这个先进经验，还可以促进企业中各方面工作的改进，并不断开辟新的潜在力量的源泉。因为实行这个办法，每一个班组（甚至每一个人）、每一天每一个指标的计划数字和实际完成数字都是清清楚楚的。分析、研究那些没有完成计划的数字，就可以找到工作中的缺点加以改进；比较、分析那些完成得最好的数字，就可以找到先进经验，加以巩固和推广。
    有些人认为目前我国很多企业的计划工作和各种数据还不完全精确，因而没有条件推行这一先进经验。当然，这种看法反映了工作中困难的一面；但是即使在这些企业中，也并不是完全不能推行这种办法的。因为现在鞍钢所实行的班组节约核算并不是班组的全面的经济核算制度，而只是根据各个班组的具体情况颁发几个主要的指标，只计算这几个主要指标的经济效果。这只要划分了固定的班组，有每天的作业计划，有原材料消耗定额和各种技术经济定额，有原始记录，就可以做到。原始记录、作业计划和定额如果不准确，可以在推行中间逐步改进。在步骤上也可以先从主要的工段和几个主要的指标做起，然后再逐步扩大和深入。有些企业是连续生产，无法按班组分别计算成绩的，也可以按设备（如炼铁炉、炼钢炉）为单位来计算。有些工序生产过程很长，无法按天计算成绩，也可以按生产周期来检查各个指标的完成情况（如一窑砖要三十天才能烧好，就以三十天为一周期）。总之，尽管各个企业的生产特点不同，但这个先进经验的基本精神都是适用的。
    还有一些企业的领导干部中间盛行着这样一种论调：“现在我们的中心工作是计划管理、技术管理，成本财务工作只能下一步再抓。”这种论调，实际上反映了这些同志不重视或者不善于把自己的工作重点和对企业的全面领导结合起来；也反映了他们还没有真正认识资金问题对实现社会主义工业化的严重意义。鞍钢中板厂的经验已经证明上述论调是错误的。中板厂今年上半年主要搞责任制，下半年主要是加强技术管理，中板厂的领导干部都是工人出身，文化程度不高，经济核算的知识也并不够，但他们却成功地推行了这个经验，使自己从亏累变成了有盈余的企业。
    当然，把推行这个先进经验看得过于轻易也是不对的。要推行这个办法，必须作好一定的准备工作。首先，企业的领导干部和有关的职能机构应该对本企业的财务成本作一次比较全面的分析，找出影响成本的主要因素和浪费的主要方面。这样，就能明确地掌握节约核算中应该解决的主要问题。同时用这样的分析来教育群众，就可以使群众增加成本工作知识，提高对降低成本的重要意义的认识，明确降低成本和全面完成国家计划的努力方向。其次，根据全面完成国家计划的要求，应该给各个班组确定那几个主要指标，怎样正确地计算这些指标的经济价值，也需要作缜密的研究。最后，根据经济核算的要求，旧有的原始记录可能有不周全、不适用或不及时的地方，也需要作必要的整顿和改进。
    除了做好这些准备工作，和向工人们进行充分的政治动员之外，在推行这个先进经验的时候，特别要注意把成本财务人员发动起来。因为要把班组核算的工作做好，要把各种指标和经济效果的计算方法确定得合理、准确、并且容易为工人所掌握，要使每天的执行结果都能及时结算清楚、及时公布，要对各种核算数字进行经常的分析，从中发现问题，给领导上提供改进工作的资料，离开成本财务人员的创造性劳动、高度的责任感和主动精神，是不可能实现的。
    在推行这个先进经验的时候，还必须同正确的工资制度和奖励制度配合起来，从物质利益上来保证经济核算制度的贯彻和促进劳动竞赛的不断高涨。如果忽视了这个问题，这个先进经验也是不易实现和巩固的。
    推行这个经验的时候，在指导思想上要严防只从本企业经济利益出发的本位主义和局部观点。必须牢牢记住：我们是社会主义性质的企业，我们的经济核算必须是而且也只能是国家观点的经济核算。只从本单位赢利出发，不按照国家和人民需要的品种组织生产，不愿意制造新产品，不爱惜国家资源，只想走费力小而产值大的捷径，这些都是资产阶级经营思想的反映，必须坚决反对。
    周恩来总理在“政府工作报告”中指出：按照一九五四年的计划指标计算，中央和地方的国营工业的生产成本只要降低百分之一，就可以每年为国家节约八千四百亿元；劳动生产率只要提高百分之一，就可以每年增产一万六千亿元。让我们努力学习苏联社会主义企业管理的先进经验，把广大职工的力量和智慧更好地组织起来，为国家积累更多的资金吧。
