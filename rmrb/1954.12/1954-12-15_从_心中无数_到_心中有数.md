    From "Having No Idea" to "Having a Clear Picture"
    Deng Xipei, Township Head of Lientang Township, Yingde County, Guangdong Province

    In the past, I did not clearly understand the significance of the unified purchase and sale of grain. I always thought it was "restricting farmers from eating grain," thinking, "Buying and selling should be free!" Because my own thinking was not clear, I did not work with much enthusiasm.

    During the summer harvest, the higher authorities assigned our township the task of purchasing 390,000 catties of surplus grain. I felt that the task was too heavy and had no confidence in completing it. After returning to the township from the meeting, many farmers complained, actually wanting to keep more and sell less. I indulged them, feeling that everyone had just been emancipated not long ago and their foundations were not strong, so they really had difficulties. Therefore, I casually told people, "Sell more to the state! The government will help solve the problem if there is no grain to eat later." As a result, some poor farmers with difficult lives sold their rations, some farmers did not sell thoroughly, and some middle peasants still have nearly 1,000 catties of early rice stored until now. Therefore, the summer grain purchase task was short by 20,000 catties.

    After the autumn harvest, I thought to myself, "The autumn grain purchase task is only 180,000 catties; perhaps we can complete the task!" But when I went to the district for a meeting, I heard that the grain purchase task was to be increased, and I couldn't understand it at the time. Because more than 1,000 mu of our township was affected by drought in the late crop this year, although some were rescued, the losses were still great. Especially thinking about the difficulties encountered during the summer grain purchase, my confidence was even lower. Therefore, during the discussion, I emphasized the difficulties and wanted to reduce the task.

    Later, after hearing the district committee's report, I further understood the great significance of the unified purchase and sale of grain in supporting national industrial construction, supporting the people in disaster areas, and supporting the liberation of Taiwan. Indeed, if the country cannot achieve industrialization, farmers will have no hope of using machines to cultivate the land, and it will be impossible to increase production. For example, this year's late crop, if the farmers were not organized to carry out agricultural technology reforms with the help of the state and used the state's water pumps for drought resistance, our township would not only have failed to increase production by 8 percent, but would have certainly reduced production. Some areas in the Yangtze and Huai River basins suffered floods this year. In the past, the farmer brothers in those areas sold grain to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating South China, and now we should also vigorously support them. By selling more of our surplus grain to the state, we are also supporting the struggle to liberate Taiwan, so that the Taiwanese compatriots who have not yet been emancipated under the oppression of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique can be emancipated as soon as possible.

    During the discussion, we also recalled the benefits brought by the unified purchase and sale of grain. It goes without saying that the prices of grain and other commodities are stable, but more importantly, it has restricted the development of capitalist spontaneous forces, enabling the farmers in our township to gradually embark on the bright road of socialism. Before the unified purchase and sale of grain, the capitalist spontaneous forces in our township were very serious. There were sixty households in the township engaged in businesses such as selling cattle and slaughtering pigs. After the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain, these phenomena have disappeared. More than 77 percent of the farmers in the township have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and the farmers who have not joined have also organized mutual aid teams, actively preparing to transfer to the cooperatives.

    After such a comparison, I realized the benefits of implementing the unified purchase and sale of grain for farmers, criticized my past wrong ideas, and resolved to complete this autumn grain purchase task. I studied the situation in our township: this year's late crop is estimated to have a harvest of 800,000 catties of grain. After deducting 119,000 catties for public grain, 20,000 catties for seeds, and more than 550,000 catties for rations, there are still more than 100,000 catties left. After careful calculation, I had a clear picture in my mind, so I volunteered to increase the grain purchase task by 100,000 catties (finally, the district leaders determined it to be 90,000 catties). After returning from the district, I explained the significance of the autumn grain purchase to the cooperative members and farmers, and everyone expressed warm support. Under the leadership of the agricultural production cooperatives, farmers throughout the township actively sold their surplus grain to the state. As of November 22, more than 246,000 catties of surplus grain have been stored in the warehouse, and it is estimated that the township's autumn grain requisition and purchase task can be completed by the end of the month.

    从“心中无数”到“心中有数”
    广东省英德县莲塘乡乡长　邓锡培
    过去，我对粮食统购统销的意义认识不清，总以为这是“限制农民吃粮”，心想：“买卖也兴个自由呀！”自己思想不通，干起来劲头也不大。
    夏收时，上级分配我们乡要购余粮三十九万斤，我就觉得任务太重，没有信心完成。开完会回乡后，很多农民都来叫苦，其实他们是想多留少卖，我也迁就他们，觉得大家刚翻身不久，底子不厚，实在有困难。所以，我当时随随便便向人宣传说：“多卖些给国家吧，以后没粮吃时政府会帮助解决的。”结果，有些生活较困难的贫农把口粮也卖了，有些农民又卖得不彻底，有些中农直到现在还存有早谷近千斤。因此，夏季购粮任务差两万斤没有完成。
    秋收后，我心里想：“秋粮的征购任务只有十八万斤，大概可以完成任务吧！”但我到区里开会，听到要增加购粮任务，当时就想不通。因为我们乡今年下造旱了一千多亩，虽然抢救了一部分，但仍然损失很大。特别是想到夏季购粮时碰到的困难，信心更加不足。因此，在讨论时我就强调困难，想减轻任务。
    后来听到区委的报告，进一步认识了粮食统购统销对支援国家工业建设、支援灾区人民、支援解放台湾的重大意义。的确，如果国家不能实现工业化，农民要想用机器耕田就没希望，想增产也就不可能。例如今年晚造，如果农民们不组织起来在国家的帮助下进行农业技术改革并且借用国家的抽水机进行抗旱，我们乡不但不能增产百分之八，还一定要减产。长江和淮河流域的一些地区今年遭了水灾。过去那些地区的农民兄弟卖粮支援人民解放军解放华南，现在我们也应大力支援他们。我们把更多的余粮卖给国家，也就是支援了解放台湾的斗争，使在蒋介石卖国集团压迫下还未翻身的台湾同胞早日得到翻身。
    我们在讨论中还回想了一下粮食统购统销带来的好处。粮价和其他物价稳定这是不必说了，更重要的是限制了资本主义自发势力的发展，使我们乡的农民都逐步走上了社会主义的光明大道。统购统销前，我们乡的资本主义自发势力是很严重的，全乡有六十户做贩牛、宰猪等生意。实行粮食统购统销后，这些现象已经绝迹了。全乡百分之七十七以上的农民都参加到农业生产合作社来了，未入社的农民也大都组织了互助组，积极准备转社。
    经过这样一对比，我才认识到实行粮食统购统销对农民的好处，批判了过去的错误思想，下定决心完成这次秋季购粮的任务。我研究了我们乡的情况：今年下造估计有八十万斤粮食的收成，除交公粮十一万九千斤、种籽二万斤、口粮五十五万多斤外，还有十多万斤。经过细算后，我心里有了底，就自报购粮任务增加十万斤（最后，区的领导上确定为九万斤）。从区回来后，我把秋季购粮的意义向合作社的社员和农民们说清楚，大家都表示热烈拥护。在农业生产合作社的带动下，全乡农民都积极把余粮卖给国家。到十一月二十二日止，全乡已有二十四万六千多斤余粮入库，估计到月底可以完成全乡秋季征粮和购粮任务。
