    Herdsmen of All Ethnic Groups in Hulunbuir Grassland
    Sell Large Quantities of Livestock Products to the State
    Herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the Hulunbuir Grassland of Inner Mongolia have sold large quantities of livestock products to the state. From January to mid-November this year, the total value of livestock, hides, milk, and other products sold by herdsmen exceeded 40 billion yuan. The herdsmen are still continuing to sell various livestock products. These livestock and livestock products are being continuously transported to cities and rural areas throughout the country. More than 4,000 head of draught animals have been transported to the eastern part of Hulunbuir League, Jirem League, and the agricultural areas of Liaoning Province. Thousands of tons of milk and cattle and sheep hides are continuously supplied to Inner Mongolia's dairy, leather, and fur factories as raw materials.
    The purchasing power of the people in the Hulunbuir Grassland pastoral areas has increased this year compared to the past. Thirteen Mongolian herdsmen households in the Huheletai Livestock Production Cooperative sold livestock products worth more than 53 million yuan. Herdsmen of various banners (counties) have purchased many industrial and agricultural products from state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives. New commodities that were not available or rarely supplied in the past have been welcomed by the herdsmen. (Xinhua News Agency)

    呼伦贝尔草原各族牧民
    把大量畜产品卖给国家
    内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原上的各族牧民，把大量的畜产品卖给国家。今年一月到十一月中旬，牧民们卖出的牲畜、毛皮、牛奶等总值在四百亿元以上。现在，牧民们仍继续交售各种畜产品。这些牲畜和畜产品，正陆续运往各地的城市和农村。运到呼伦贝尔盟东部、哲里木盟和辽宁省农业区的耕畜，已有四千多头。成千吨的牛奶和牛羊皮，源源供给内蒙古乳品、制革、皮毛工厂做原料。
    呼伦贝尔草原牧区人民今年的购买力比过去提高。胡和勒泰畜牧业生产合作社的十三户蒙族牧民，卖出畜产品共值五千三百多万元。各旗牧民从国营商店和供销合作社购买了许多工业品和农产品。往年没有或很少供应过的新商品，都受到牧民们的欢迎。　（新华社）
