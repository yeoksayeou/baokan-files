Strive to Cultivate Socialist Talents for Agricultural and Forestry Construction for the Country
Sun Xiaocun, President of Beijing Agricultural University

Beijing Agricultural University fully supports the basic guidelines and tasks for higher agricultural and forestry education determined by the Second National Conference on Higher Agricultural and Forestry Education. We will implement them in our work based on the specific conditions of our university, to gradually improve the quality of our work and effectively cultivate talents for socialist agricultural and forestry construction for the country.

Teaching is the key to determining whether students can master and apply advanced agricultural scientific theories and become familiar with operational techniques to serve actual agricultural production. Our goal is that by 1957, graduating students will be able to basically complete the entire learning process according to a unified teaching plan. Beijing Agricultural University has six departments with nine specialties. For the first-year students who entered this autumn, teaching will be conducted according to a unified teaching plan. For the second, third, and fourth-year students, teaching will be conducted according to a transitional teaching plan. We plan to gradually create conditions within three years, such as vigorously preparing and opening new courses that should be offered, guiding students to write course papers according to the prescribed course types, guiding some students to write graduation theses, and holding graduation thesis defenses, so that by 1957, we will be able to basically or to a large extent deliver cadres needed by the country according to the standards required by the unified teaching plan. To achieve this goal, we must carry out the following main tasks:

First, in the process of implementing the unified teaching plan, we must strive to study and grasp its essence, constantly pay attention to the effect of implementing the unified teaching plan, and provide opinions to the Higher Education Department for reference when revising it.

Second, according to the unified teaching plan, there are still forty-two new courses in our university that cannot be offered at present. Therefore, we must seize the time and organize forces from this year to prepare new courses in various ways.

Third, since the teaching reform began in our university in 1952, because we did not have a sufficient understanding of the holistic nature of teaching content, that is, the organic organization of teaching plans, teaching syllabuses, and teaching materials, we neglected the central link of the teaching syllabus after formulating the teaching plan. Many courses have lecture notes but no teaching syllabus, and the existing teaching syllabuses have not been well reviewed, so that the position, purpose, requirements, and interrelationships of each course in the entire teaching plan are not clear enough. We fully agree with the plan proposed by the Higher Education Department at this conference to revise 130 teaching syllabuses during the winter and summer vacations this year, and we guarantee to complete the revision of the twenty teaching syllabuses (in addition to several teaching syllabuses in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine) that the Higher Education Department has entrusted our university to be primarily responsible for as scheduled. We will also strive to do a good job in the teaching syllabuses that our university participates in revising. For the teaching syllabuses that our university does not yet have in addition to the plan of the Higher Education Department, we will also organize forces to formulate them.

Fourth, plan to compile teaching materials. Teaching materials are a concentrated expression of teaching content and a necessary foundation for teachers to do a good job in lecturing. Thanks to the efforts of our teachers, many courses already have lecture notes. For example, among the eighty-five courses offered in the first semester of 1954, seventy-nine had lecture notes, accounting for 93 percent. Some of these lecture notes are relatively mature, and more than twenty types, such as General Agronomy, General Entomology, and Organic Chemistry, have been recommended by the Higher Education Department for exchange. Based on this, combined with existing or translated Soviet textbooks and materials, we plan to compile eight to ten types of textbooks and practical guidance outlines (of a preliminary nature) in 1956 under the unified plan of the Higher Education Department, some of which may be completed as early as 1955, and another twenty to thirty types will be compiled in 1957.

Fifth, do a good job in internship work. Internship is the main link in teaching where theory is linked to practice. In the past two years, the scale of our university's teaching and production internships has continued to expand, and we have also accumulated some experience. This year, a total of 830 students and 118 teachers participated in teaching and production internships, with internship sites including 54 state-owned farms, ranches, collective farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and school experimental farms. This teaching method has a great effect on consolidating students' theoretical knowledge, on students' understanding of actual production conditions and mastering operational techniques, and on cultivating students' independent working ability and their love for labor and working people. We must strive to do a good job in internship work in the future, so that the teaching policy of linking theory with practice and learning with application can be gradually implemented. In order to do a good job in internship work, we must currently do a good job in summarizing this year's internships; compile internship outlines that meet teaching requirements and are specific and feasible; strengthen contact with various internship sites; and gradually achieve fixed internship sites.

Sixth, conduct course papers and graduation theses in a planned manner. Course papers and graduation theses are both teaching methods that train students to apply theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems, and can cultivate students' independent thinking and independent working ability. In the past two years, only the Crop Cultivation Teaching and Research Group and the Tillage Teaching and Research Group have guided students to do course papers, and no graduation theses have been done. In order for the graduates of 1957 to complete their learning tasks according to the unified teaching plan, we have decided to gradually promote the teaching method of course papers according to the provisions of the teaching plan. Course papers must be combined with practice, and in addition to paying attention to production technology issues, we must also pay attention to economic, labor organization, and business management issues. Teaching and research groups that have already done course papers are required to improve on the original basis; those that have not done so are required to designate teachers to formulate plans under the leadership of the主任 (zhǔrèn, director), and complete the preparation work. Regarding doing graduation theses, because our university has no experience, professional course teaching and research groups are required to designate teachers to try to do them under the leadership of the department head. We plan to complete the stage of teachers trying to do them in the summer of 1955, and obtain more complete experience through thesis defenses; and begin to guide some students to try to do them in key areas from 1955 to 1956. In addition to the above work, we must also continuously improve the content and methods of lecturing, tutoring, and experimentation, do a good job in classroom discussions and exercises, guide students to use their time reasonably, conduct self-study in a planned manner, and carefully check the teaching effect, so that examinations can play their due role in the teaching process.

Regarding scientific research work. This conference pointed out that carrying out scientific research work in higher agricultural and forestry schools is an important key to continuously developing agricultural production, enriching agricultural science, and improving teaching quality. Since our university studied the documents on the general tasks of the state during the transition period, the enthusiasm of teachers has increased because they have realized the significance of scientific research work for the cause of socialist construction, and the administrative aspects have also done some work in a timely manner, so scientific research work has been launched. In the first half of this year, the number of research topics in our university has increased from 42 to 111. These scientific research works can be roughly divided into two categories according to their nature: one is the survey and research directly for teaching, including using local materials, repeating experiments of advanced Soviet scientific theories, and collecting and investigating agricultural production data. The other is the survey and research combined with production. The direct purpose of this type of work is to solve problems in production. The research work that our university is currently carrying out and has achieved certain results in the past includes crop hybridization and breeding of improved varieties, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests and synthesis and use of pesticides, cultivation of fruit trees and vegetables, storage and quarantine of fruits and vegetables, prevention and control of livestock diseases, and investigation of agricultural conditions. Some of these works are carried out jointly with the Chinese Academy of Sciences or the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute. In addition, graduate students have begun to conduct research work under the guidance of Soviet experts. Under the guidance of teachers, some students in five specialties, including agronomy, fruit trees and vegetables, plant protection, agricultural chemicals, and agricultural economics, have organized twenty-three scientific groups to conduct research work, which has a great effect on improving their independent working ability and cultivating their love for their majors and science. This conference attached great importance to scientific research work in higher agricultural and forestry schools, and clearly stipulated that the purpose of scientific research work is to serve production and also to serve teaching, and to serve teaching and also to serve production. The two are consistent and combined with each other. In order to further unleash the potential of teachers and carry out scientific research work, we are prepared to check and summarize this year's research work. Up to now, 20 of the 111 research projects have been completed, and 12 have submitted reports. We plan to hold a scientific discussion meeting before the winter vacation this year to appropriately展開 (zhǎnkāi, unfold) academic debates. At the same time, based on these research reports, plus other works of teachers, we are preparing to publish a journal. At the same time, according to current requirements, we are drafting a scientific research plan for next year. This plan will implement the following principles based on the specific conditions of our university: First, scientific research work can be better combined with actual production, so that it can become a part of the country's agricultural scientific research work and effectively serve agricultural production; second, reduce the number of projects, concentrate forces, and select several more important topics to organize relevant teachers to conduct comprehensive research; third, summarize the production experience of farmers and sort out the agricultural heritage of the motherland. In addition to requiring relevant teaching and research groups to strive to implement it in the scientific research work carried out by its members, we plan to use various opportunities to organize teachers to conduct in-depth investigation and research in rural areas. At the same time, we will report our university's preparation for the new course of Chinese agricultural history to the Higher Education Department, and suggest that the Higher Education Department organize relevant colleges and universities to conduct it jointly, so that the compilation of Chinese agricultural history can be completed as soon as possible, and prepare some necessary conditions for the sorting out of the agricultural heritage of the motherland; fourth, carry out academic criticism and discussion, so as to improve our academic ideological level.

Teaching is the main work of the school. Beijing Agricultural University, like other institutions of higher learning, began to implement teaching reform in the autumn of 1952. In the past two years, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the active efforts of the teachers, we have achieved certain results. However, it would be a serious mistake to think that our teaching reform has come to an end, or that we have learned enough from the Soviet Union. In fact, judging from the basic guidelines and tasks for higher agricultural and forestry education proposed by the Higher Education Department at this conference, what we have done in our current work is still far from meeting the requirements of this task: in terms of teaching reform, we still need to make great efforts to fully implement the unified teaching plan; in terms of learning from the Soviet Union, we are still rarely able to truly master and apply advanced Soviet scientific theories and experience, and creatively guide production practice; the teaching staff of Beijing Agricultural University is still one of the better ones, but we cannot offer some courses, the quality of some courses is not high, and the work of training teachers is very poor; our scientific research work is only just beginning, our experience in organizing and leading this type of work is not enough, a climate of great importance to scientific research has not yet formed in the whole school, and the coordination of various forces within us and the combination of the school and business departments are not enough. We must face these shortcomings squarely, and in the process of implementing the resolutions of this conference, concentrate our efforts to improve the teaching and scientific research work of our university a step further.

In order to effectively promote teaching and scientific research work and complete the tasks assigned to us by the state, we must also do many other tasks well, and one of the key tasks among them is to strengthen political and ideological leadership.

Strengthening political and ideological leadership is mainly divided into two aspects: first, help teachers to continuously improve their political and ideological level through the study of political theory, national policies, and current affairs issues, participation in meetings of business departments, going deep into the countryside, contacting farmers, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Only in this way can the ability of teachers to learn from the Soviet Union and combine with China's reality be effectively improved, thereby enhancing the ideological nature of various courses and improving teaching. The other aspect is to strengthen students' political and ideological education. As pointed out in the summary of this conference, in strengthening students' political and ideological education, one, it is necessary to strengthen students' professional ideological education; two, it is necessary to strengthen students' love for physical labor, love for physical laborers, and respect for working people; and three, it is necessary to cultivate students' communist moral qualities. We believe that these three instructions are on the mark for the shortcomings of higher agricultural and forestry colleges and universities. Taking our university as an example, in the past, the political and ideological education of students was mainly done by the Party and League organizations. Although the administrative aspects also did some work, they did not grasp the main links. In the future, we must raise the political and ideological education of students to the due position according to the tasks assigned to us by the state, organize forces from all aspects, adopt various methods, and strengthen students' professional ideological education, quality education, labor education, discipline education, and health education, and cultivate them into well-rounded, patriotic, and loyal to the cause of socialist construction, healthy, brave, hardworking, and fearless of any difficulties. And in order to do these two aspects of work well, the administrative leadership must strive to study political theory and national policies, delve into business, contact the masses, go deep into reality, further implement the Party's policy towards intellectuals, and be brave in accepting criticism, and constantly check their own shortcomings. Only in this way can we strengthen the leadership of political ideology, give play to everyone's enthusiasm and creativity, and do a good job with the strength of the collective.

With the progress of the socialist transformation of agriculture, agriculture increasingly needs a large number of advanced technical and management talents. Meeting this need, and guaranteeing quality. This is supporting agricultural production, this is supporting the socialist transformation of agriculture, this is supporting the country's socialist industrialization. Beijing Agricultural University, like other brother schools, is willing to contribute its greatest strength to the completion of this glorious task.

    努力为国家培养社会主义的农林建设人材
    北京农业大学校长　孙晓村
    北京农业大学完全拥护第二次全国高等农林教育会议确定的今后高等农林教育的基本方针和任务，我们将根据本校的具体情况，把它贯彻到工作中去，以逐步提高工作质量，有效地为国家培养社会主义农林建设的人材。
    教学工作是决定学生能否掌握和运用先进农业科学理论，熟悉操作技术，为农业生产实际服务的关键所在。我们的目标是到一九五七年时，毕业学生能基本上按照统一教学计划完成全部学习过程。北京农业大学有六个系，下设九个专业，对今年秋季入学的一年级学生，按照统一教学计划进行教学，对二、三、四年级则按过渡教学计划进行教学。我们计划在三年内逐步创造条件，如大力准备并开出应开的新课，指导学生按照规定的课程种类做课程论文，指导部分学生做毕业论文和举行毕业论文答辩，以期在一九五七年时，能够基本上或在很大的程度上按照统一教学计划所要求的规格，输送国家所需要的干部。为了达到这个目标，我们要进行下列几项主要工作：
    首先，要在执行统一教学计划的过程中，努力钻研并掌握它的精神实质，不断注意执行统一教学计划的效果，向高等教育部提出意见，以便修订时参考。
    第二，按照统一教学计划，我校还有四十二门新课在目前是无法开出的，因此，必须抓紧时间，从今年起组织力量采用各种方式准备新课。
    第三，我校自从一九五二年开始教学改革以来，由于我们对于教学内容的整体性即教学计划和教学大纲、教材等的有机组织的性质认识不够，因而在制订教学计划后，忽视了教学大纲这一中心环节。许多课已有讲义但还没有教学大纲，已有的教学大纲也没有很好地审查，致使各课程在整个教学计划中的地位、目的、要求和它们的相互关系都不够明确。我们完全同意这次会议上高等教育部所提出的在今年寒假和明年暑假分别修订一百三十种教学大纲的计划，并保证如期完成高等教育部委托我校主要负责的二十种教学大纲（此外尚有畜牧兽医方面的几种教学大纲）的修订工作，对我校参预修订的教学大纲也将努力做好。在高等教育部的计划之外，我校还没有的教学大纲，我们也要组织力量制订。
    第四，有计划地编写教材。教材是教学内容的集中表现，是教师做好讲授工作的必要基础。我校由于教师们的努力，很多课程已有讲义，如一九五四年上学期所开的八十五种课中，有讲义的计七十九种，占百分之九十三，其中有一部分讲义比较成熟，经高等教育部推荐交流的有普通耕作学、普通昆虫学、有机化学等二十多种。以此为基础，结合已有的或正在翻译中的苏联教本和资料，我们在高等教育部的统一计划下，拟在一九五六年编写出教本和实习指导大纲（初稿性质）八至十种，其中个别的可提早在一九五五年内完成，一九五七年再编写出二十至三十种。
    第五，做好实习工作。实习是教学上理论联系实际的主要环节。两年来，我校的教学实习和生产实习的规模不断扩大，也累积了一些经验。今年的教学实习和生产实习共有学生八百三十人、教师一百一十八人参加，实习场所有国营农场、牧场、集体农庄、农业生产合作社和学校实验农场等五十四处。这种教学方式对巩固学生所学的理论知识，对学生了解实际生产情况和掌握操作技术，对培养学生的独立工作能力和热爱劳动、热爱劳动人民的品质，都有很大的作用。我们今后要努力搞好实习工作，使理论联系实际和学用一致的教学方针得以逐步贯彻。为了做好实习工作，目前要做好今年的实习总结；编写符合教学要求而又具体可行的实习大纲，加强和各实习场所的联系，逐步做到固定实习场所。
    第六，有步骤地试行课程论文和毕业论文的教学方式。课程论文和毕业论文都是锻炼学生把理论知识用于解决实际问题的教学方式，能以培养学生独立思考、独立工作能力。两年来，我校只有植物栽培学教研组和耕作学教研组指导学生做过课程论文，至于毕业论文还没有做过。为了使一九五七年的毕业生能按统一教学计划完成学习任务，我们决定按照教学计划的规定，逐步推行课程论文这一教学方式。课程论文必须结合实际，除应注意生产技术问题外，还要注意经济、劳动组织和经营管理等方面的问题。对凡已做过课程论文的教研组，要求在原有基础上提高一步；没有做过的，要求指定教师在教研组主任的领导下订出计划，完成准备工作。关于做毕业论文，因为我校还没有经验，因此要求专业课程的教研组在系主任的领导下，指定教师试做。我们计划在一九五五年夏季完成教师试做的阶段，通过论文答辩以取得较完整的经验；一九五五年到一九五六年开始指导部分学生重点试做。除了上述的工作以外，我们还要不断地改进讲授、辅导和实验的内容及方法，做好课堂讨论和课堂练习，指导学生合理使用时间，有计划地进行自学，认真检查教学效果，使考试考查能发挥它在教学环节上应起的作用。
    关于科学研究工作。这次会议指出，开展高等农林学校的科学研究工作是不断发展农业生产、丰富农业科学和提高教学质量的重要关键。我校自从学习关于国家过渡时期总任务的文件以后，由于教师们认识到科学研究工作对于社会主义建设事业的意义，积极性提高了，行政方面也及时地做了一些工作，科学研究工作便开展起来，在今年上半年，我校的研究题目已从四十二项增加到一百一十一项。这些科学研究工作按其性质大致可分两类：一类是直接为了教学的调查研究，包括利用当地材料，重复苏联先进科学理论的试验及搜集和调查农业生产的资料。另一类是结合生产的调查研究，这类工作的直接的目的是为了解决生产中的问题。我校现在进行的和过去已取得一定成绩的研究工作，计有作物的杂交和良种的繁育、病虫害的防治及农药的合成和使用、果树蔬菜的栽培、水果及蔬菜的储藏并检疫、牲畜疫病的防除以及农业情况的调查等。这些工作，有的是和中国科学院或华北农业科学研究所共同进行的。此外，在苏联专家指导下，研究生开始进行研究工作。在教师指导下，农学、果树蔬菜、植物保护、农用药剂和农业经济等五个专业的部分学生已组织了二十三个科学小组，进行研究工作，这对于提高他们的独立工作能力，培养他们对专业和科学的热爱，有很大的作用。这次会议对于高等农林学校的科学研究工作给予很大的重视，而且明确规定了科学研究工作的目的是为生产同时也为教学服务，为教学同时也为生产服务，两者是一致的，是相互结合的。为进一步发挥教师潜力，开展科学研究工作，我们准备检查和总结今年的研究工作。到目前止，一百一十一项研究工作中已完成的计有二十项，提出报告的已有十二项。我们拟在今年寒假前开一个科学讨论会，适当地展开学术论辩。同时，以这些研究报告为基础，再加上教师的其他著作，准备出版学报。同时，根据当前的要求，草拟明年的科学研究计划。这个计划将根据我校的具体条件，贯彻下面几项原则：一、科学研究工作能更好地结合生产实际，俾能成为国家的农业科学研究工作的一部分，有效地为农业生产服务；二、减少项目，集中力量，并选择几个较重要的题目，组织有关教师进行综合性的研究；三、总结农民生产经验和整理祖国农业遗产，除要求有关教研组在它的成员所进行的科学研究工作中努力贯彻外，拟利用各种机会组织教师深入农村进行调查研究。同时将我校对于中国农业史这一门新课的准备情况报告高等教育部，建议由高等教育部组织有关院校共同进行，使中国农业史的编纂工作早日完成，为祖国农业遗产的整理准备一些必要的条件。四、开展学术上的批评和讨论，从而提高我们的学术思想水平。
    教学工作是学校的主要工作。北京农业大学和其他高等院校一样，是从一九五二年秋季开始实行教学改革的。两年来，由于中央的正确领导，教师们的积极努力，我们已取得一定的成绩。然而，假若认为我们的教学改革已经告一段落，认为学习苏联已经学得差不多了，那是严重的错误。事实上，从高等教育部在这次会议中所提出的今后高等农林教育的基本方针任务来看，我们目前工作上所已经作到的，距离这个任务的要求还远得很：在教学改革方面，我们还须作很大的努力，才能完全实行统一教学计划；在学习苏联方面，我们还很少能够真正掌握运用苏联的先进科学理论和经验，创造性地指导生产实践；北京农业大学的师资条件还属于比较好的一类，但我们有些课开不出来，有些课的质量不高，培养师资的工作做得很差；我们的科学研究工作也仅仅是开端，我们组织领导这类工作的经验很不够，全校还没有形成一种十分重视科学研究的风气，我们内部的各方面力量的配合以及学校和业务部门的结合都还不够。我们必须正视这些缺点，在贯彻这次会议决议的过程中，集中力量把我校的教学工作和科学研究工作提高一步。
    为了有效地推进教学工作和科学研究工作，完成国家给予我们的任务，还必须做好其他的许多工作，而其中带有关键性的一项工作，就是加强政治思想领导。
    加强政治思想领导，主要分两个方面：首先，帮助教师通过政治理论、国家政策和时事问题的学习，参加业务部门的会议、深入农村、接触农民和开展批评和自我批评等方法，不断地提高政治思想水平，逐步清除资产阶级的思想意识和改变习惯作风。只有这样，教师们学习苏联、结合中国实际的能力才能有效地提高，从而增强各种课程的思想性，教学方面也能有所改进。另一方面是加强学生的政治思想教育。如这次会议总结中所指出的，在加强学生的政治思想教育工作中，一、要加强学生的专业思想教育；二、要加强学生热爱体力劳动，热爱体力劳动者，尊重劳动人民的教育；三、要培养学生具有共产主义道德品质。这三点指示，我们认为是切中高等农林院校的工作缺点的。以我校来讲，对于学生的政治思想教育工作，过去主要是由党、团组织来做的，行政方面虽然也做了一些工作，但没有抓住主要的环节。今后我们一定要根据国家所给予我们的任务，把学生的政治思想教育工作提高到应有的地位，组织各方面的力量，采用多种多样的方式，对学生加强专业思想教育、品质教育、劳动教育、纪律教育、健康教育，培养他们成为全面发展的、热爱祖国、忠于社会主义建设事业、体魄健全、勇敢勤劳、不怕任何困难的坚强战士。而要做好这两方面的工作，行政领导方面必须努力学习政治理论和国家政策，钻研业务，联系群众，深入实际，进一步贯彻执行党对知识分子的政策，并且勇于接受批评，不断地检查自己的缺点。只有这样，才能加强政治思想的领导，发挥大家的积极性和创造性，以集体的力量搞好工作。
    随着农业的社会主义改造工作的进展，农业愈来愈需要大量的高级技术和管理人材。满足这个需要，而且保证质量。这就是支援农业生产，这就是支援农业的社会主义改造，这就是支援国家的社会主义工业化。北京农业大学和其他兄弟学校一样，愿为完成这个光荣的任务而贡献出最大的力量。
