The farce of the American aggressor group in the United Nations is becoming increasingly ugly.

After repeatedly stealing the flag of the United Nations as a tool for aggression and interference in the internal affairs of other countries, the American imperialists, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and other countries that are working to maintain the United Nations organization, have forced the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the so-called "accusation" of our country's judgment of the American spy case raised by the United States, and hastily passed a proposal fabricated by the United States that is unreasonable and provocative. This is another blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and the basic norms of international law, making the United Nations morally more degraded.

The two batches of American spy crimes pronounced by the Military Tribunal of our Supreme People's Court are undeniable with human and material evidence and deserved punishment. Precisely because the bloody hand of the American aggressor group in carrying out subversive activities in our country was caught, after a series of self-contradictory denials failed, it moved out the United Nations as a tool to cover up its dispatch of spies to carry out subversive activities against the People's Republic of China.

People remember that in the two American spy cases of Downey and Fecteau, etc., that were arrested and sentenced, these were spies of the US spy agency, the US Central Intelligence Agency. The other criminals, Arnold and others, belonged to the "581st Air Supply and Communications Squadron," which was specifically established by the United States to airdrop spies and supply materials in the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, and maintain communication with ground spies. They also served the US intelligence agency, the US Central Intelligence Agency. These American spies drove planes to sneak into our country to carry out espionage reconnaissance activities, and it is only natural that they should be sanctioned by our laws.

In fact, the American aggressors dare not touch the facts of the above two batches of spy crimes at all; simply because a war had occurred in Korea, simply because there were American prisoners of war in the Korean War, the American aggressors described spies such as Arnold as prisoners of war who had not been repatriated in the Korean War, and further slandered our country for violating the Korean Armistice Agreement. As for the two spies, Downey and Fecteau, as the American "Christian Science Monitor" regretfully quoted, since they were "civilian" personnel and did not "wear uniforms," there was no way to describe them as prisoners of war in the Korean War. The likes of Lodge had to remain silent about their facts, or at most use excuses such as "they disappeared on a flight from Korea to Japan" and "we don't know how the Chinese Communist Party caught Downey and Fecteau" to muddle through. How shameless is this!

The indictment of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China pointed out with extreme clarity that Arnold and others were doing espionage work for the US Central Intelligence Agency in the name of the Air Force and under the guise of performing "psychological warfare" tasks. Their mission was not to fight on the Korean battlefield, but to invade China's airspace to investigate the state secrets of the People's Republic of China. The planes they were riding were not for combat, but for espionage reconnaissance. Their planes were shot down in Chinese airspace. They were also arrested on Chinese territory. These facts confirm that they are spies who violated Chinese law. No denial can cover up the espionage crimes they committed against our country.

The sophistry and denial of the Dulles and Lodge clique are useless. The fact that the American war-mongering group is carrying out espionage and subversive activities against China, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries has long been repeatedly exposed and is well known. According to the public communique issued by our Ministry of Public Security on November 25 this year, more than 200 American and Chiang Kai-shek paratrooper agents have been wiped out by us in the past four years. Who doesn't know that under the so-called "Mutual Security Act" in the United States, the US government openly uses a large amount of funds to dispatch and buy spies to carry out subversive activities against the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries?

As for the American aggressors' attempt to forcibly argue that Arnold and others were un-repatriated prisoners of war, this is just a pretext for the American aggressors to cover up their own crimes and attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs. During the war of aggression against Korea, the US imperialists not only occupied our country's territory of Taiwan, wantonly violated our country's territorial waters and airspace, and carried out bombing and strafing, but also openly violated the Prisoner of War Agreement and looted more than 20,000 captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides, incorporating them into the armies of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek to serve as cannon fodder, and have not yet accounted for them. This illegal act by the United States stands in stark contrast to the fact that the Korean and Chinese sides have always strictly implemented and maintained the Korean Armistice Agreement. It is the American aggressors who frequently violate the Korean Armistice Agreement. China's solemn action of exercising its sovereignty to punish spy criminals is entirely China's internal affair and has nothing to do with the Korean Armistice Agreement.

It must be pointed out that in addition to aiming to deny and cover up its subversive activities, the reason why the American aggressors moved the United Nations out in this incident was to divert people's attention, further create propaganda hostile to the Chinese people, incite war and hatred, and cooperate with the American aggressors' ongoing war provocation behavior against China to aggravate international tensions.

People know that the American aggressor group has tried its best to prevent the United Nations from discussing the Soviet proposal on "the acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China and the responsibility of the US Navy for these acts," and after the United Nations General Assembly included this issue on the agenda, it attempted to have the United Nations General Assembly end it hastily. Now, the American aggressors' acts of aggression against China have become even more intensified. The United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group have signed a "Mutual Defense Treaty" that openly seizes China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu and prepares for a large-scale attack on China. This is a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world, and it is resolutely opposed by the Chinese people and all peace-loving countries and people.

Obviously, the United Nations, under the pressure of the United States, discussing the American so-called "accusation" of China's judgment of the American spy case is another major stain in the history of the United Nations. The People's Republic of China's sentencing of American spies who intruded into its own territory is a legitimate action to safeguard national sovereignty and security, and it is also a matter within the scope of China's internal affairs powers. The United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that the United Nations shall not interfere in matters that are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any country. Therefore, the United Nations has no right to interfere in China's judgment of the American spy case. What the United Nations should be concerned about is the United States' violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and its destruction of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Agreement, its repeated looting of tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and its incorporation of them into the armies of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek.

In the ugly farce of the American aggressors playing "accusations" and forcing the passage of their resolutions in the United Nations, the representatives of some countries, like Britain's Nutting, slandered the Chinese people like a parrot learning from Lodge; this practice of obliterating the truth and reversing right and wrong can only be interpreted as encouragement and assistance to the aggressors.

The crimes of the United States sending spies to intrude into our country's borders to carry out subversive activities are absolutely impossible to deny. The American aggressors cannot change this matter with any threats, and they will never be able to scare the Chinese people's just stand on this issue. The discussion conducted by the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States is completely illegal and unjust; the American resolution it passed is absurd, and, as the Indian representative to the United Nations said, can only make the international situation more serious. The Chinese people's resolute punishment of American spy criminals is sympathized with and supported by all just people in the world. The UN flag cannot cover up the crimes of American airdropped spies.

    联合国旗帜掩盖不住美国侵略集团的罪行
    吴全
    美国侵略集团在联合国的丑剧，真是愈演愈丑了。
    在一再盗用了联合国的旗帜作为进行侵略和干涉他国内政罪行的工具后，美国帝国主义现在又不顾苏联和其他努力维护联合国组织的国家代表的反对，强使联合国大会讨论美国提出的所谓“控诉”我国判决美国间谍案的问题，并开动表决机器，匆匆通过了一个美国制造的、无理取闹的提案，这就再一次粗暴地违反了联合国宪章和国际公法的起码准则，使联合国在道义上益见沦落。
    我国最高人民法院军事审判庭宣判的两批美国间谍罪行，人证物证俱在，罪有应得，这是绝对不容抵赖的。正由于美国侵略集团在我国进行颠覆活动的血手被抓住了，它便在一系列的自相矛盾的抵赖失败以后，把联合国搬了出来，作为替它掩盖派遣间谍进行对中华人民共和国实行颠覆活动的工具。
    人们记得：在被捕和宣判的两起美国间谍案件中，唐奈和费克图等这一起，是美国间谍机关美国中央情报局的间谍分子。另一起阿诺德等罪犯，属于美国专门建立来在苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家空投间谍分子和供给补给物资，并和地面间谍分子保持通讯联络的“五八一空中补给与通讯联队”，他们也是为美国谍报机关美国中央情报局服务的。这些美国间谍驾驶飞机潜入我国进行间谍侦察活动，他们应受我国法律的制裁，乃是理所当然的事。
    实际上，美国侵略者对于上述两批间谍犯罪的事实根本不敢触及；仅仅由于朝鲜发生过战争，仅仅由于在朝鲜战争中有过美军战俘，美国侵略者便把间谍阿诺德等说成是在朝鲜战争中未被遣返的被俘人员，并进而诬蔑我国违反朝鲜停战协定。至于唐奈和费克图这两个间谍，正如美国“基督教科学箴言报”所引为遗憾的，由于他们是“文职”人员，没有“穿着制服”，因而就没法把他们说成是朝鲜战争中的战俘，洛奇之流便只有缄口不谈他们的事实，或者顶多用“他们是在从朝鲜到日本的一次飞行中失踪的”、“我们不知道中国共产党是怎样抓到唐奈和费克图的”等托词来支吾。这是何等恬不知耻啊！
    中华人民共和国最高人民检察院起诉书中异常明确地指出，阿诺德等是以空军名义和以执行“心理作战”任务作为对外的掩护，而为美国中央情报局作谍报工作的。他们的任务不是在朝鲜战场上作战，而是侵入中国的领空来侦查中华人民共和国的国家机密。他们所乘的飞机也不是为了作战之用，而是为了间谍侦查之用。他们的飞机是在中国领空被击落的。他们也是在中国领土上被捕的。这些事实肯定他们是违犯中国法律的间谍。任何抵赖掩盖不了他们对我国所犯的间谍罪行。
    杜勒斯、洛奇之流的狡辩抵赖是没有用的。美国好战集团对中国、苏联和各人民民主国家进行间谍颠覆活动的事实，早已是屡被揭露，人所共知的事了。根据今年十一月二十五日我公安部所发表的公报，四年以来，已有二百多名美国和蒋贼空投特务被我歼灭了。谁不知道在美国的所谓“共同安全法”下面，美国政府公开以大量拨款作为派遣和收买间谍、以进行对苏联及各人民民主国家的颠覆活动呢？
    至于美国侵略者企图强词夺理地把阿诺德等说成是未被遣送的战俘，这只不过是美国侵略者假托名义掩盖其本身罪行、并企图借此干涉中国内政的赖词罢了。在侵朝战争期间，美帝国主义者不仅侵占我国领土台湾，肆意侵犯我国领海和领空，进行轰炸扫射，而且公然违反战俘协定劫夺朝中被俘人员达二万余名，把他们编入李承晚、蒋介石军队去当炮灰，至今未作交代。美国这种非法行为，和朝中方面一贯严格执行和维护朝鲜停战协定的事实，适成强烈的对照。经常违反朝鲜停战协定的正是美国侵略者。中国行使自己的主权处分间谍罪犯的严正行动，完全是我国的内政，它和朝鲜停战协定丝毫没有关系。
    必须指出：除了旨在为其颠覆活动实行抵赖和遮羞外，美国侵略者在这个事件上所以要把联合国搬出来，乃是为了转移人们的视线，进一步制造敌视中国人民的宣传，煽动战争和仇恨情绪，配合美国侵略者正在进行的对中国的战争挑衅行为来加剧国际紧张局势。
    人们知道，美国侵略集团曾极力阻挠联合国讨论苏联所提出的“关于侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任”的提案，并在联合国大会把这个问题列入议程后，企图使联合国大会匆匆结束。现在，美国侵略者对中国的侵略行为更为变本加厉了。美国和蒋介石卖国集团已签订了公然强占中国领土台湾和澎湖、准备大规模进攻中国的“共同防御条约”，这是对于亚洲和世界和平的严重威胁，也是中国人民和一切爱好和平的国家和人民所坚决反对的。
    显然，联合国在美国的压力下，讨论美国所谓“控诉”中国判决美国间谍案的问题，是联合国历史上的又一个重大的污点。中华人民共和国判处侵入自己国境的美国间谍，是维护国家主权和安全的正当行动，也是中国内政权限以内的事情。联合国宪章明确地规定了联合国不得干涉本质上属于任何国家国内管辖的事件。因此，联合国根本无权过问中国判决美国间谍的问题。联合国应该过问的，倒是美国违反朝鲜停战协定并破坏战俘遣返协定、多次劫走朝中战俘几万人，把他们编入李承晚和蒋介石军队的罪恶行动。
    在美国侵略者向联合国玩弄“控诉”和强制通过其决议的丑剧中，有些国家的代表，像英国的纳丁，就像鹦鹉一般学洛奇对中国人民进行诬蔑；这种抹杀真理颠倒是非的做法，只能被解释为对侵略者的鼓励和帮助。
    美国派遣间谍侵入我国国境进行颠覆活动的罪行，是绝对无法狡赖的。美国侵略者以任何威胁手段都不能改变这个事情，也决不可能吓倒中国人民在这个问题上的正义立场。联合国在美国的操纵下所进行的讨论是完全非法的，不义的；它所通过的美国决议，是荒谬的，而且正像印度驻联合国代表所说的，只能使国际局势严重化。中国人民坚决惩处美国的间谍犯，是为全世界一切正义人类所同情和支持的。联合国的旗帜掩盖不住美国空投间谍的罪行。
