Zhejiang Province’s mountain area peasants are now actively constructing small mountain reservoirs in large numbers. According to incomplete statistics from the Jinhua, Quzhou, and Jiaxing special districts, the peasants plan to build more than 300 small reservoirs this winter, of which 72 have already broken ground, and the rest have generally completed surveying and design work.

    The Qingling Reservoir, a relatively large-scale project newly built in Zhuji County, Jinhua Special District, started construction in November and is expected to be completed before the spring plowing next year. This will allow more than 5,000 mu of nearby farmland to be basically free from the threat of drought. Rui'an County in Wenzhou Special District is planning to build the largest Taoshan Reservoir in the province, which can irrigate 50,000 mu of farmland after completion. (Xinhua News Agency)

    浙江山区农民兴修小型水库
    浙江省山区农民正动手大量兴修山间的小型蓄水库。据金华、衢州、嘉兴等专区不完全统计，农民们今冬计划兴修三百多座小型蓄水库，其中已有七十二处破土动工，其余一般也已完成了勘察、设计工作。
    金华专区诸暨县今冬新建的规模较大的青岭水库，十一月间已经开工，预计明年春耕前可以完工，那将使附近五千多亩农田可以基本摆脱干旱威胁。温州专区瑞安县正在筹划兴建一个全省最大的陶山水库，建成后可以灌溉五万亩农田。　（新华社）
