    Curing Political Paralysis

    Selecting typical events from the reality of class struggle to educate cadres and the people to recognize the international and domestic political environment, and to raise people's revolutionary vigilance, is an important and regular task of newspapers.

    Hebei Daily reported on November 26th about the counter-revolutionary element, Yi Guan Dao altar leader Kang En, who had infiltrated an agricultural production cooperative and poisoned three head of livestock, plotting to undermine the agricultural production cooperative. The editorial explained the significance of being vigilant against such sabotage plots. On November 6th, 9th, and 13th, the Shanxi Daily more prominently reported and commented on the counter-revolutionary sabotage incident that occurred in the Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative. Through this incident, the Shanxi Daily reminded people that counter-revolutionary elements hiding in the countryside, seeing the vigorous development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, aimed the brunt of their counter-revolutionary sabotage at the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The counter-revolutionary element Chen Yanshan (originally from Xia County, Shanxi Province), who infiltrated the national cotton bumper harvest model Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative, served as a loyal accomplice to the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek/Yan Xishan bandit army before liberation, killing our militiamen and plundering the property of the masses. After our army liberated Xia County, Chen fled to Quzhuangtou Village in Jieyu County to escape punishment, changed his name, disguised himself as a poor peasant, and cheated the peasants of the fruits of struggle during the land reform. In January of last year, he took the opportunity to infiltrate the Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative. Seeing this cooperative develop and consolidate day by day, and the socialist consciousness of the peasants increase day by day, Chen gradually and thoroughly exposed his vicious face of hatred for the people and hatred for socialism, and carried out a series of insidious sabotage activities.

    The counter-revolutionary element Chen Yanshan could not scare away the peasant masses who joined the cooperative by using openly blatant means, so he pretended to be active to win the trust of the peasants. Before joining the cooperative, he "complimented and flattered everyone he met, regardless of age or gender," and never "bargained" when helping others with masonry or carpentry work, pretending to say that he "never forgot the Communist Party after being emancipated." After infiltrating the cooperative, he used every opportunity to create dissatisfaction among the members, undermine the leadership's prestige, provoke discord among the members, and incite members to withdraw from the cooperative. For example, when he incited some members to withdraw from the cooperative, he said: "We suffer harm in the cooperative, but we don't get any benefits." "The government is asking us to join the agricultural cooperative just to support Qu Yaoli, the model." He even seized upon and used the divorce of the peasant couple Qu Wenbo and his wife. He maliciously told Qu Wenbo that the divorce was masterminded by Qu Yaoli behind the scenes. As a result, in less than three or four months, he deceived five peasant households, including Qu Wenbo's, into withdrawing from the cooperative, and attempted to undermine the Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative.

    The facts revealed by the newspaper prove that the low political vigilance of some working cadres is the main reason why counter-revolutionary elements and class enemies infiltrate agricultural production cooperatives and take the opportunity to carry out sabotage. The counter-revolutionary element Chen Yanshan infiltrated the Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative precisely because it did not conduct a review when absorbing members. The Shanxi Daily further pointed out in its editorial that, under the same circumstances, some agricultural production cooperatives have even had counter-revolutionary elements and class enemies seize the positions of custodians, secretaries, and even deputy directors. They undermine the production system, embezzle and steal, and deliberately create chaos in order to disintegrate the cooperative from within. In order to learn from the lessons, raise vigilance, and ensure the consolidation and development of agricultural production cooperatives, the Rural Work Department of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a symposium of directors of agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs. The Shanxi Daily also published a large amount of the minutes of this symposium. The directors said in their speeches that seeing the incident of counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging the Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative in the newspaper had cured their "paralysis." In the future, they must be vigilant, strengthen unity, and strictly enforce the membership review system, "...look at people realistically, not just look at their surface smiles and back-slapping"; and not let counter-revolutionary elements who pretend to be active take advantage of loopholes again.

    医治政治上的麻痹病症
    从阶级斗争的现实中选取典型事件，教育干部和人民认清国际、国内的政治环境，提高人们的革命警惕，是报纸的重要而经常的任务。
    河北日报在十一月二十六日报道了混入农业生产合作社的反革命分子、一贯道坛主康恩毒死社内牲口三头、阴谋搞垮农业生产合作社的破坏事件，并在社论中说明警惕这种破坏阴谋的意义。十一月六日、九日、十三日的山西日报，更连续突出地报道和评论了曲耀离农业生产合作社发生的反革命破坏事件。山西日报通过这一事件提醒人们：藏匿在农村的反革命分子，见到农业生产互助合作运动蓬蓬勃勃的发展，就把反革命破坏的锋芒对准互助合作运动。混进全国棉花丰产模范曲耀离农业生产合作社的反革命分子陈彦山（原籍山西省夏县），解放前充当日寇、蒋阎贼军的忠实爪牙，杀害我民兵，抢掠群众财物。我军解放夏县后，陈犯畏罪潜逃到解虞县曲庄头村，改名换姓，伪装贫苦农民，在土地改革中骗取了农民的斗争果实，去年一月又乘机混入曲耀离农业生产合作社。陈犯眼见这个社一天天发展和巩固起来，农民的社会主义觉悟一天天提高，就逐渐彻底地暴露了自己仇视人民、仇视社会主义的凶恶面目，进行了一连串阴险的破坏活动。
    反革命分子陈彦山不可能用公开露骨的手段吓退入社的农民群众，就来假装积极，骗取农民的信任。在入社以前，他“不管男女老少逢人恭维奉承”，帮别人做泥工、木工活时从来“不讨价”，假意说他“翻身不忘共产党”。而在混进社以后，他就利用各种机会制造社员的不满情绪，破坏社的领导威信，挑拨社员间的团结，煽动社员退社。如他煽动一些社员出社时说：“社里有咱受的害，没咱沾的光。”“政府叫咱参加农业社，还不是为了替曲耀离这个模范捧场。”甚至连农民曲文波夫妇闹离婚的事也被他抓住利用了。他恶意地对曲文波说，离婚是曲耀离在背后主谋的。结果不到三、四个月的时间，他就把曲文波等五户农民欺骗出社，并且企图把曲耀离农业生产合作社搞垮。
    报纸揭露出的事实证明：某些工作干部的政治警惕性不高，是使反革命分子、阶级敌对分子混入农业生产合作社并乘机破坏的主要原因。反革命分子陈彦山，就是乘曲耀离农业生产合作社在吸收社员时没有加以审查才混进去的。山西日报在社论中进一步指出：在同样情况下，更有一些农业生产合作社被反革命分子、阶级敌对分子窃取了保管、秘书、甚至副社长的职位，他们破坏生产制度，贪污、盗窃，故意造成混乱局面，以从内部进行瓦解。为了记取教训，提高警惕，保障农业生产合作社的巩固和发展，中共太原市委农村工作部召开了郊区农业生产合作社社长座谈会，山西日报又以大量篇幅刊登了这个座谈会的记录。社长们在发言时纷纷表示：从报纸上看到反革命分子破坏曲耀离农业生产合作社的事件，治好了自己的“麻痹病”，今后一定要警觉起来，加强团结，严格社员的审查制度，“……看人要求实际，不能光看他表面对咱嘻嘻哈哈，拍拍打打”；再不叫伪装积极的反革命分子钻空子。　（奔放）
