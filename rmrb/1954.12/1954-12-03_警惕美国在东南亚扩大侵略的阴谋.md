Beware of the American Conspiracy to Expand Aggression in Southeast Asia
Li Gao

The so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," cobbled together by the United States, Britain, France, and six other countries in September of this year, was submitted by the U.S. government to the U.S. Senate for discussion and ratification on November 10. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's testimony indicates that the American aggressive bloc is impatiently seeking to use this treaty to undermine the Geneva Accords on restoring peace in Indochina, intensify the suppression of national liberation movements of Asian countries, and promote the U.S.'s neocolonial war plan.

In his testimony, Dulles fabricated some non-existent shameless lies about the so-called danger of communist subversion in Southeast Asian countries and the "aggressive intentions" of the Chinese Communist Party. He also proposed to convene a Southeast Asian military bloc meeting to discuss "how to deal with subversive activities." Dulles's fabricated lies cannot deceive anyone. In his radio address on November 19, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, in response to Dulles's fabricated question about the so-called "communist subversive activities" in Southeast Asian countries, pointed out, "I have not obtained such evidence anywhere," and said, "My own impression is that in the past few months, the Chinese government has provided much evidence of its peaceful intentions... I do not know of any specific incidents of interference that have occurred recently anywhere." Obviously, Dulles's purpose is to use his fabricated absurd lies as an excuse to intensify his aggression in Southeast Asia and throughout Asia.

Increasingly more news proves that a major goal of Dulles's request to convene a Southeast Asian military bloc meeting is to interfere in the situation in Indochina. A November 16 dispatch from Agence France-Presse revealed that the Southeast Asian military bloc meeting requested by the United States will "quickly assess the situation in Indochina, especially in Vietnam," and "take action there to boost morale." Philippine Vice President Garcia also revealed on November 19 that the meeting, scheduled to be held in Bangkok, will focus on the "situation in South Vietnam."

As everyone knows, the United States initiated the formation of the Southeast Asian military bloc on the eve of the Geneva Conference in order to expand the then-Indochina War and organize colonial countries to take "joint action" to suppress the people of Indochina. After the Geneva Conference overcame the U.S.'s sabotage conspiracy and reached an agreement to restore peace in Indochina, the U.S.'s aggressive activities in Indochina have not relaxed for a moment. The "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" signed by the U.S., Britain, France, and other countries in Manila openly designated Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam as the "protected" areas of the Southeast Asian military bloc. This is a clear violation of the provisions of the Geneva Conference agreement that Indochinese countries shall not participate in any military alliance. The U.S. aggressive bloc is also trying to squeeze out France's position in Indochina and strengthen its control over the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in order to realize its conspiracy to further undermine the implementation of the Geneva Conference agreement on restoring peace in Indochina. During the U.S.-France talks held in Washington in late September this year, the United States forced France to hand over the "training rights" of the Bao Dai puppet army to the United States and announced that the United States would provide "economic assistance, budget support, and other assistance" "directly" to Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam's Ngo Dinh Diem clique. Recently, the United States sent Collins, the former U.S. Army Chief of Staff who participated in planning the Korean War, to Saigon in the name of "special envoy." At a press conference held in Saigon on November 17, Collins, in addition to declaring that the United States "fully supports" the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to combat other political factions in South Vietnam that oppose Ngo Dinh Diem, also announced that the United States has recommended to take full responsibility for training the South Vietnamese puppet army, and "90 percent of the equipment for these troops will be American equipment." When talking about the free elections to be held throughout Vietnam in 1956 in accordance with the Geneva Accords, Collins said that he hoped "U.S. aid" would help all Vietnamese "oppose communism." This clearly exposes that the U.S. aggressive bloc wants to strengthen the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and its army to undermine the free elections throughout Vietnam and impose the rule of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique on the Vietnamese people so that the United States can establish a new colonial rule in Indochina.

In order to realize this conspiracy, the U.S. aggressive bloc increasingly needs to coerce other countries in the Southeast Asian military bloc to share the responsibility for undermining the Geneva Conference agreement. Not only that, the U.S. aggressive bloc also attempts to collude with other colonial countries to jointly suppress the movement of Asian countries for national liberation. In his speech on November 11, Dulles, when talking about the so-called "subversive activities" of the Communist Party in Southeast Asia, mentioned Thailand and Malaya in addition to Vietnam. However, people know that the places where the U.S. aggressive bloc clamors about so-called "subversive activities" are precisely the places where the U.S. aggressive forces want to intensify their infiltration. Now, the United States is increasingly trying to use Thailand as a tool for its aggressive adventures in Southeast Asia and turn Thailand into a U.S. military base, and therefore concocts out of thin air that Thailand is threatened by communism. At the same time, it is precisely because the United States is eager to intervene in Malaya to jointly suppress the national liberation movement of the Malayan people with Britain, so Dulles said that the Malayan issue also needs "discussion." As the "Indian Express" pointed out long ago: "Dulles's mention of the danger of internal subversion is an ominous sign. This means that the contracting parties (of the Southeast Asia Military Group) can interfere in the internal affairs of any country on the pretext of suspecting subversive activities, and incidentally suppress the nationalist movement to support the reactionary regime."

In order to realize their neocolonialist plan and create tension, the U.S. aggressive bloc is intensifying the expansion of the aggressive forces of the United States and its accomplices through the Southeast Asian military bloc. The main obligation imposed on the contracting parties by the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" is to require them to "separately and jointly maintain and develop" their military forces "by means of sustained and effective self-help and mutual assistance." After the signing of this treaty, the United States frantically urged its followers to expand their armies and prepare for war. The Philippine Ministry of National Defense announced on September 28 that the United States and the Philippines had agreed to double the number of Philippine troops "that can be immediately put into combat" soon. On October 21, the United States announced that it would "accelerate the implementation of the plan to provide Pakistan with a large amount of military assistance," and would provide Pakistan with a so-called "assistance" of 105 million U.S. dollars in this fiscal year. In Thailand, according to the "New York Post" on September 29, the U.S. government has formally proposed to Thailand to send U.S. troops, including a division of personnel, and some naval and air forces to station in Thailand. At the same time, the United States itself is also stepping up the redeployment of aggressive military forces in the Pacific region to establish "mobile strike forces." An Associated Press dispatch on November 18 revealed that the United States is currently transferring more than 30 warships from the Atlantic and other places to strengthen the U.S. naval power in the Pacific.

These evil activities of the U.S. aggressive bloc are increasingly seriously threatening the peace and security of Asian countries. Now, peace-loving countries in Asia are working together to establish collective peace in Asia. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence announced by the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Myanmar have been widely supported by Asian countries. Indian Prime Minister Nehru's visit to China has further strengthened the friendly and cooperative relations between the peoples of China and India. At the same time, the Colombo Conference countries are actively preparing to convene an Asian-African conference to strive to expand the area of peace. This universal desire for peace in Asian countries cannot be ignored; the U.S. aggressive bloc's attempt to divert the attention of peace-loving people with some conspiracy methods is impossible. The Asian people and all Asian countries that are working to consolidate peace in Asia and safeguard their sovereignty must continue to expose the U.S. aggressive bloc's conspiracy to intensify its aggressive activities by using the Southeast Asia Military Group Treaty, and thoroughly defeat the U.S.'s neocolonial war plan.

    警惕美国在东南亚扩大侵略的阴谋
    李高
    美国纠合英、法等八个国家在今年九月签订的所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”，已在十一月十日由美国政府提交美国参议院讨论批准。美国国务卿杜勒斯就这一条约的作证发言表明，美国侵略集团正迫不及待地希图利用这个条约来破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议，加紧镇压亚洲各国人民的民族解放运动，以推行美国的新殖民主义战争计划。
    杜勒斯在他的作证发言中，捏造了一些根本不存在的所谓东南亚国家中共产党颠覆的危险和中国共产党的“侵略意图”的无耻谎言，并提出要召开一次东南亚军事集团会议，来讨论“如何对付颠覆活动”。杜勒斯捏造的谎言是蒙混不了人的。印度总理尼赫鲁十一月十九日发表的广播谈话中，在答复关于杜勒斯捏造的所谓在东南亚国家中的
  “共产党颠覆活动”的问题时就曾指出：“我在任何地方都没有获得这种证据”，并且说：“我自己所得到的印象是，在过去的几个月中，中国政府已经提供了很多证据证明它的和平意图。……我不知道最近在任何地方发生任何具体的干涉事件”。显然，杜勒斯的目的是要以他自己所捏造的无稽谎言作为藉口，来在东南亚地区和整个亚洲加紧其侵略活动。
    越来越多的消息证明，杜勒斯要求召开一次东南亚军事集团会议的一个主要目标，是为了干涉印度支那的局势。法新社十一月十六日的电讯中透露：美国要求召开的东南亚军事集团会议，将“迅速地估计一下印度支那、特别是越南的局势”，“在那里采取行动以振奋人心”。菲律宾的副总统加西亚也在十一月十九日透露说，这个预定要在曼谷举行的会议，将集中讨论“南越的局势”问题。
    大家知道，美国在日内瓦会议前夕发起拼凑东南亚军事集团，就是为了要扩大当时的印度支那战争，组织殖民国家采取“联合行动”来镇压印度支那人民。日内瓦会议克服了美国的破坏阴谋而达成了恢复印度支那和平的协议之后，美国对印度支那的侵略活动仍一刻也没有放松。美、英、法等国在马尼拉签订的“东南亚集体防务条约”，就公开把柬埔寨、老挝和南越规定为东南亚军事集团的“保护”地区。这是明显地违反日内瓦会议协定中关于印度支那各国不得参加任何军事同盟的规定的。美国侵略集团并力图排挤法国在印度支那的地位，加强其对吴庭艳集团的控制，以实现其进一步破坏日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平协议的实施的阴谋。今年九月下旬美法两国在华盛顿举行的会谈中，美国就曾迫使法国把控制保大傀儡军队的“训练权”交给美国，并宣布美国“直接”给予柬埔寨、老挝和南越的吴庭艳集团以“经济援助、预算支援和其他援助”。最近，美国又把曾经参与策划侵朝战争的美国前陆军参谋长柯林斯以“特使”名义派到了西贡。柯林斯十一月十七日在西贡举行的记者招待会上，除了声明美国“全力支持”吴庭艳集团，以打击那些反对吴庭艳的其他南越的政治派系之外，并宣布美国已建议负全责来训练南越傀儡军队，而这些军队的装备将有“百分之九十是美国装备”。柯林斯在谈到按照日内瓦协定应在一九五六年举行的全越自由选举时说：他希望“美援”将有助于使所有的越南人“反对共产主义”。这就清楚地暴露了，美国侵略集团要以加强吴庭艳集团及其军队的办法，来破坏全越自由选举，而把吴庭艳集团的统治强加在越南人民的身上，以便美国在印度支那建立新的殖民统治。
    为了实现这个阴谋，美国侵略集团就愈来愈需要挟持东南亚军事集团的其他国家来分担其破坏日内瓦会议协议的责任。不仅如此，美国侵略集团还企图纠合其他殖民国家来共谋镇压亚洲各国人民争取民族解放的运动。杜勒斯在十一月十一日的发言中，说到所谓共产党在东南亚的“颠覆活动”时，除了越南之外，还提到了泰国和马来亚。但是人们知道，美国侵略集团叫嚷有所谓“颠覆活动”的地方，正是美国侵略势力要加紧渗入的地方。现在，美国正日益企图利用泰国作为它在东南亚的侵略冒险工具，并把泰国变为美国的军事基地，因而就凭空臆造出什么泰国受到了共产党的“威胁”。同时，也正是由于美国急于要插手到马来亚去伙同英国镇压马来亚人民的民族解放运动，因而杜勒斯就说马来亚的问题也需要“讨论”。正如“印度快报”所早已指出过的：“杜勒斯提到内部颠覆的危险，这是一个不祥之兆。这意味着（东南亚军事集团的）缔约国可以藉口怀疑有颠覆活动而干涉任何国家的内政，并顺便镇压民族主义运动来支持反动政权。”
    美国侵略集团为了实现他们的新殖民主义计划并制造紧张局势，正通过东南亚军事集团来加紧扩张美国及其帮凶的侵略兵力。所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”加于缔约国的主要义务，就是要求它们“分别地和共同地以持续的和有效的自助和互助的办法，维持并发展”它们的军事力量。这个条约签订之后，美国就疯狂地督促它的追随者扩军备战。菲律宾国防部在九月二十八日宣布，美菲两国已协议不久即将把菲律宾“可以立即投入战斗的部队”扩充一倍。十月二十一日，美国又宣布要“加速实现给巴基斯坦大量军事援助的计划”，本会计年度内将给巴基斯坦以一亿零五百万美元的所谓“援助”。在泰国，据“纽约邮报”九月二十九日透露，美国政府已向泰国提出正式建议，要派遣包括一师人员的美国军队和若干海空军进驻泰国。与此同时，美国自己也加紧在太平洋地区重新部署侵略军力，建立
  “机动攻击力量”。美联社十一月十八日电透露，美国目前正从大西洋等处调遣三十多艘军舰去加强美国在太平洋的海军力量。
    美国侵略集团的这种种罪恶活动，正日益严重地威胁着亚洲各国的和平和安全。现在，亚洲爱好和平的国家正在为着在亚洲建立集体和平而共同努力。中印总理和中缅总理所宣布的和平共处的五项原则，已得到亚洲国家的广泛支持。印度尼赫鲁总理对中国的访问，已进一步加强了中印两国人民的友好合作关系。与此同时，科伦坡会议国家正在积极筹备召开亚非国家会议，以努力扩大和平地区。亚洲国家的这种普遍的和平愿望是不可忽视的；美国侵略集团企图用一些阴谋手法来转移爱好和平人民的视线，这是办不到的。亚洲人民和亚洲各个为巩固亚洲的和平和维护自己的主权而努力的国家，必须继续揭穿美国侵略集团利用东南亚军事集团条约加紧其侵略活动的阴谋，彻底击败美国的新殖民主义战争计划。
