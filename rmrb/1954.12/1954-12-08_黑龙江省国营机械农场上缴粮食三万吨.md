    State-run Mechanical Farms in Heilongjiang Province Hand Over 30,000 Tons of Grain

    The sixteen state-run mechanical farms directly under the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture will hand over 30,000 tons of high-quality grain to the state this year. Currently, workers at each farm are working intensely to thresh and transport the grain to be handed over.

    These sixteen mechanical farms cultivated a total of more than 28,300 hectares of land this year. Due to improvements in agricultural technology and strengthened management, generally higher yields were achieved. Wheat, in particular, achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The farms cultivated over 12,000 hectares of wheat, with an average yield of 1,310 kilograms per hectare, exceeding last year by 52 percent. The farms also achieved good harvests of soybeans, sorghum, corn, millet, etc. The Qingyang Farm produced 1,500 kilograms of soybeans per hectare, and the farms averaged 2,251 kilograms of corn per hectare and 1,669 kilograms of sorghum, all exceeding the yields of local farmers.

    These sixteen farms harvested a total of more than 38,300 tons of grain this year. After deducting the required seeds, food, and feed, the remaining grain, which accounts for about 80 percent of the total yield, will be handed over to the state. The more than 14,000 tons of wheat to be handed over have already been transported. Currently, more than 40 trucks and over a hundred rubber-wheeled carts at each farm are transporting the soybeans to be handed over to the state grain departments. (Gong Wanzhong, Song Zhongshi)

    黑龙江省国营机械农场上缴粮食三万吨
    黑龙江省农业厅直属的十六个国营机械农场，今年将上缴国家三万吨优等粮。目前，各农场职工正紧张进行脱谷和运送上缴粮食。
    这十六个机械农场今年共播种两万八千三百多公顷土地，由于改进农业技术，加强经营管理，普遍获得较高产量。其中小麦获得了空前丰收，各场共种小麦一万二千多公顷，每公顷平均产量为一千三百一十公斤，超过去年百分之五十二。各场的大豆、高粱、玉米、谷子等，也获得较好的收成，庆阳农场的大豆每公顷产一千五百公斤，各场玉米每公顷平均产二千二百五十一公斤，高粱为一千六百六十九公斤，都超过当地群众的产量。
    这十六个农场今年共收获三万八千三百多吨粮食，除留下需用的种籽、食粮、饲料外，其余约占总产量百分之八十的粮食都上缴给国家。上缴的一万四千多吨小麦已运送完毕，现在各场四十多辆载重汽车和百余辆胶皮车正把上缴的大豆向国家粮食部门运送。（宫万钟　宋仲石）
