Xinhua News Agency, London, 29th: Ceylon Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala, in a BBC broadcast talk on the 26th, denied that so-called American "aid" could change Ceylon's attitude of not participating in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.

Kotelawala made this statement on the eve of his visit to the United States. He said it was normal for Asian countries to be suspicious of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. He also said that in his view, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was established "too hastily." In this organization, "the number of non-Asian countries exceeds that of Asian countries, and other Asian countries view this organization with suspicion for fear of losing their newly acquired sovereignty."

Kotelawala declared that he himself was anti-communist, but he firmly advocated that Asian countries should "resolve to live together in peace" to "achieve the goal of Asian peace." He said:
	“The best way to achieve this goal is for Asian countries to offer guarantees of peace among themselves.”

Referring to the trade agreement between Ceylon and China, Kotelawala said that China "is the only place willing to pay a good price for rubber and where rice can be bought at a good price."

    锡兰总理批评东南亚条约
    【新华社二十九日讯】伦敦消息：锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉二十六日在英国广播公司主办的一次广播谈话中否认所谓美国的“援助”可以改变锡兰不参加东南亚条约集团的态度。
    科特拉瓦拉是在访问美国的前夕发表这一谈话的。他说，亚洲国家对东南亚条约组织心存猜疑，是合乎常情的。他又说，据他看来，东南亚条约组织成立得“太急躁了”。在这个组织里，“非亚洲国家的数目多于亚洲国家，而其他的亚洲国家，由于唯恐失去它们新得到的主权，是以猜疑的眼光来看这个组织的”。
    科特拉瓦拉声明他自己是反共的，但是，他坚决主张亚洲国家应该“下决心在和平中相处”，以“达到亚洲和平的目的”。他说：
  “达到这个目的的最好办法是亚洲国家在它们自己中间提出和平的保证。”
    科特拉瓦拉在谈到锡兰和中国之间的贸易协定时，说中国“是唯一的一个愿意出好价钱购买橡胶，并且可以用好价钱在那里买到大米的地方”。
