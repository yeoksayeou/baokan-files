    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 9th: Workers in state-owned and local state-owned coal mines in Shanxi Province have completed the state's annual raw coal production plan one month ahead of schedule. They plan to increase coal production by another million tons for the state before the end of the year.
    The level of mechanization in Shanxi Province's coal mines has generally improved this year. Coal mining at the Datong Coal Mine is now fully mechanized, and various types of machinery have also been widely adopted in coal mines such as Yangquan. At the same time, workers have learned various advanced experiences in labor competitions and put forward a large number of rationalization proposals. Workers at the Datong Coal Mine put forward more than 1,250 rationalization proposals from January to October, and implemented 83 suggestions from Soviet experts. The output in the first eleven months of this year exceeded the total output of last year by more than 30 percent. According to statistics from January to October, labor efficiency at the Yangquan Coal Mine has also increased by 4.19 percent, and costs have been reduced by 5.32 percent. The Fujiatan Coal Mine has widely used advanced working methods such as parallel fracture blasting and longwall mining. The average daily output from January to November this year increased by 37 percent compared with the average daily output of last year. As a result of increasing transportation equipment and promoting advanced experience, the daily output of the Xiyu Coal Mine has increased by 2.7 times, completing the annual plan 47 days ahead of schedule.
    Now coal miners are tapping production potential in all aspects to ensure the completion of the production increase plan by the end of the year.

    【新华社太原九日电】山西省国营和地方国营煤矿的职工已提前一个月完成国家全年原煤生产计划，到年底计划再给国家增产一百多万吨煤。
    山西省的煤矿今年机械化程度都普遍提高。大同煤矿采煤已全部机械化，阳泉等煤矿也广泛采用了各种机械。同时，职工们在劳动竞赛中学习了各种先进经验，提出了大批合理化建议。大同煤矿职工一月到十月提出的合理化建议就有一千二百五十多件，贯彻苏联专家建议八十三件，今年十一个月的产量就超过了去年全年的产量百分之三十以上。阳泉煤矿根据一月到十月的统计，劳动效率也提高了百分之四点一九，成本降低了百分之五点三二。富家滩煤矿广泛运用平行龟裂爆破、长壁式回采等先进工作方法，今年一月到十一月平均日产量比去年全年平均日产量提高百分之三十七。西峪煤矿增加搬运设备和推广先进经验的结果，日产量提高二点七倍，提前四十七天完成了全年计划。
    现在煤矿工人们正从各方面挖掘生产潜力，保证完成到年底的增产计划。
