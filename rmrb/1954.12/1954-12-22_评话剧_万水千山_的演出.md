    The performance of the play "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains," which reflects the great Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, has been warmly welcomed by the audience. They have received a profound education in revolutionary heroism through the images on the stage.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army created an unprecedented and earth-shattering 25,000-li Long March, shattered the pursuit, encirclement, and interception of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's million-strong army, overcame all the difficulties and dangers caused by natural conditions, and displayed a spirit of perseverance and a high degree of class solidarity and friendship. This revolutionary contingent, traversing eleven provinces, withstood severe tests, overcame all man-made and natural difficulties and disasters, and advanced victoriously, unstoppable by anyone.

    "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains," written and directed by Comrade Chen Qitong, depicts some important aspects of this great Long March – starting from the Red Army's second attack on Loushan Pass, passing through the Yi ethnic region, forcibly crossing the Dadu River, crossing the grasslands, and finally conquering Lazikou. With full political enthusiasm and infinite love for the revolutionary cause, he brought this great subject to the stage through his own personal experience and profound feelings, and through years of creative work, giving the audience a deep sense of emotion and strong encouragement.

    The success of the play "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains" is not only due to its truthful reflection of the history of the Long March, depicting concrete facts such as the forced crossing of the Dadu River, crossing the snow-capped mountains, and traversing the grasslands...; it is mainly because, through these historical facts, it prominently expresses the strong fighting will, noble class qualities, and revolutionary optimism of the fighting Chinese working class in extremely difficult revolutionary struggles; and these are vividly embodied through the various distinct characters created by the author. Secondly, the author powerfully writes about the power of the Party's leadership and political work, which is demonstrated through the political instructor Li Youguo. He is not a personification of concepts, he is someone who lives and fights alongside everyone. The author portrays this representative of the Party's leadership through a series of concrete actions – this is an important factor in the success of this play. Thirdly, the author writes about class unity and friendship from the tense combat life, which is an important feature of the revolutionary army, as reflected in the relationship between Li Youguo and Zhao Zhifang: they suffered the same hardships in the past, are fighting together today, and share a common revolutionary ideal. The common destiny of the class unites them as firmly as brothers. This is the basis for the unity between comrades-in-arms and between superiors and subordinates. Class friendship and solid unity generate immeasurable strength. Furthermore, the play reflects the implementation of the Party's ethnic policies and the relationship between the Red Army and the people, vividly demonstrating the essence of this people's army.

    The performance of this play is also successful. The director, actors, and various departments of stage art work have all made their greatest efforts.

    Comrade Chen Qitong, the playwright and director, is a veteran of the Long March. The characters he created are undoubtedly the people he knows best; his experiences in the Long March and all his feelings are undoubtedly important factors in the success of this performance.

    What are the achievements of the director in this play's performance? I think they are mainly reflected in the following aspects: 1. Enabling the actors to acquire the life of the Long March, which is a starting point for creation and the development of imagination. It makes the characters and events live in the historical life of the Long March, making us feel a sense of reality and strong infectiousness. 2. The entire play reveals the power of the Party's ideological work. Although all the characters (except for the negative characters) have differences in personality and degree of awareness, one can clearly feel that there is a powerful ideology – a common ideal and aspiration that unites and guides the entire army to bravely advance towards victory. Everyone's activities are directed towards a common goal and are governed by the same ideology: to lead the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle to a new victory. From this arises revolutionary optimism, a strong iron will, and a vigorous spirit. Because of this, in those difficult, dangerous, lacking clothing, food, disease, and disaster-stricken situations, we do not feel sadness or frustration; on the contrary, we feel a touching spiritual force impacting us, making us feel that those characters are standing before us so magnificently. 3. The personalities of the main characters are distinct and prominent, such as the instructor Li Youguo, the deputy battalion commander Luo Shuncheng, the regimental commander Huang, the battalion commander Zhao Zhifang, the second company commander Wang Deqiang, the propaganda team member Li Fenglian, and the old boatman, all of whom give us a deep impression. 4. The director uses bold emotions, broad brushstrokes, and bright colors to depict some of the main scenes and characters; the intensity of the rhythm, the fullness of the emotions, and the grandeur of the momentum also enhance the drama's momentum and infectiousness.

    Regarding the actors' character creation, first and foremost should be mentioned Comrade Lan Ma, who plays the instructor Li Youguo. He has achieved new accomplishments in acting art. When we mention Lan Ma, we will think of the images of the small clerk and the old professor he created in "Ten Thousand Homes, One Light" and "Hope in the World." He is familiar with those characters. His experience of life in the old society and his indignation and hatred towards the dark rule of the reactionary ruling class gave life to the characters he created, and they are still remembered today. However, from playing the old professor to playing the instructor Li Youguo – from playing a petty-bourgeois intellectual to playing a political cadre in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, this is a huge change in character creation. Lan Ma's creation of the image of such an excellent political cadre in the Red Army who is infinitely loyal to the revolution is successful.

    He first strives to explore the inner world of the character and uses this as the starting point for his creation in handling the character's actions. The character he creates cares for every comrade with all his strength, organizes everyone ideologically and practically, and conducts timely propaganda and mobilization to ensure the completion of every specific combat task of the Party. In this way, the image of Li Youguo, an outstanding cadre who dedicated his life for the benefit of the whole, is established. In the handling of movements, he consciously pays attention to overcoming movements that lack internal basis and strives for clarity, conciseness, and authenticity in his actions. These efforts are crucial and decisive for the creation of his character. In the fifth act, the character's optimism and loyalty to the revolutionary cause and the character's noble emotions and qualities are even more concentratedly highlighted. Even before he dies from being unable to support himself, he still cares for the central leaders with the greatest sincerity, because he understands that it is impossible without the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. His last words, "A living horse for the headquarters leaders," "Let the revolution ride on the horse to advance!" – make people feel that the character's personality is about to soar. These are all well expressed. Many viewers are deeply moved.

    In continuous performances, Lan Ma has made new progress in his role. The internal activities are more substantial, the actions are more solid and concise; some of the trivial and unrealistic movements and some of the emotionally untrue parts in the initial stage of the performance, after being filled with new things, also make people feel real and credible. This continuous process of processing and correcting the creative spirit and serious creative attitude is the guarantee of its increasingly perfect role.

    Of course, there are still shortcomings. For example, the impression given by the first part of the play is not deep enough, and it feels light in weight; the scene with Xiao Zhou in the fifth act also feels a bit too relaxed. Apart from the actions of not being able to stand up and fainting, it is completely like a healthy person without illness or injury, which makes people feel inadequate.

    Secondly, Comrade Liang Yuru, who plays the deputy battalion commander Luo – this new actor who has not performed much – revealed his creative talent in this performance. He allows us to see Luo Shuncheng, a brave and good fighter. He is infinitely loyal to the Party and the revolution, but he cannot completely get rid of the narrow and backward thinking of the peasants – making revolution is still making revolution at the doorstep; he is fierce and brave on the battlefield, but his policy concepts are not strong; his cultural level is low, he can't turn his mind around, his leadership style is simple, and he is impatient; he can't take on the burden of battalion commander, and he feels distressed that he can't do it... and so on. These characteristics belonging to Lao Luo are all vividly and clearly expressed. Liang Yuru grasped the character's simple and straightforward personality, which is the most essential characteristic of this worker-peasant cadre. When Regimental Commander Huang announced the division headquarters' appointment of Zhao Zhifang, the company commander of the first company, as the acting battalion commander of the first battalion, Lao Luo's mood was complex. On the one hand, he was very painful because he felt that he could not take on the burden of leadership, but at the same time, he had no unpleasant emotions about Zhao's acting as the battalion commander of the first battalion (he had previously requested this from the leadership). This handling is very normal and should be so. He is in pain, but not because of any personal gains or losses, but because he feels his ability is not enough;... Later, when Zhao Zhifang went to the division headquarters for a meeting, he handed his hat to Zhao, revealing such frankness, sincerity, and care for his comrades, which convincingly highlighted Lao Luo's personality.

    From the second act of the play onwards, Lao Luo's actions are less, or rather, he is no longer the central character, but his personality, which has been basically completed in the first and second acts, does not lose its brilliance in the subsequent acts; – this is the charm of characterization. The actor performs appropriately, very much like such a cadre. The voice and movements should all be possessed by such a personality. As far as a new actor is concerned, such an achievement is exciting. If we were to ask for further improvement, in some places, such as the second act, he still has some inappropriate exaggerations and excesses. At the same time, he has not been able to arrange and use his strength well – he uses his strength almost equally, making people feel that he is somewhat strained and mentally exhausted. This needs to be further honed in terms of acting art. The more the actor filters out the rough things on his body, the more refined his artistic performance will be.

    Feng Guanghui, who plays Regimental Commander Huang, is also a young actor, and he also performs very well. Although there are not many scenes, he makes us clearly see the image of a relatively mature regimental commander. He is strict with his cadres but treats them like brothers, he is familiar with his cadres, loves them, and does not relax his teaching to them, and he timely encourages them to keep moving forward. When he appears, confidence and strength also come.

    Feng Guanghui's creation of Regimental Commander Huang is also satisfying. He created the image of a high-spirited and energetic young military officer. His character has a solemn demeanor, is energetic, capable, and intelligent; he makes people feel close, he is a member of the troops, and he is an outstanding one; the creation of this image is successful. The only shortcoming is that it makes people feel that there is still a bit of a pretense, that is to say, the physical movements and modeling that the actor strives to pursue have not yet been completely integrated with the role to a higher degree, and there are still some artificial traces.

    Others such as Bai Huiwen's Li Fenglian, Gao Kun's Zhao Zhifang, Liu Yimin's second company commander Wang Deqiang, Wang Chunsheng's old boatman, Bai Erchun's Xiao Zhou, Zhou Chu's enemy chief of staff, etc., are all distinct and vivid characters, each shining with their own brilliance throughout the play.

    From the perspective of the actors' creation, the negative characters are not portrayed realistically enough. It is not enough to only pay attention to portraying the ugly external characteristics of the enemy to reveal the reactionary essence of the enemy.

    Describing the enemy's high command is necessary, which plays a major role in solving the following question: Because the reactionary ringleader Chiang Kai-shek controlled millions of troops and had military advantages, why did he suffer defeat? If this question is answered well, the weight of this play will be heavier. It will indirectly write about the wise command of the Party and Chairman Mao, as well as the contradictions between the factions of the Jiang Party and the Jiang army... etc., which can be more profoundly displayed.

    The enemy is such a person: they are extremely sinister, cunning, and utterly reactionary guys. They have rich experience in mutual infighting, have the support of imperialism, and they are seriously and painstakingly trying to eliminate us, but the result is powerless and failure. This is the historical truth.

    Of course, the enemy can be satirized and ridiculed. If we do not adopt simple caricatured methods but truthfully reveal them, then the satire will be more profound and sharper.

    Finally, what needs to be discussed is stage art work. Stage settings, lighting, and effects have also been successful, creating a realistic environment on the stage and enhancing the atmosphere. It is an organic part of the entire performance. Particularly outstanding are the first act: the Loushan Pass militia brigade headquarters, the second act: the ancient village in the Yi ethnic region, the fifth act: the grasslands, and the epilogue on the top of the "Lazikou" mountain – the boundless plains seen, etc., are all poetic and picturesque masterpieces.

    The performance of "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains" is very successful, which is the result of the concerted efforts of the director, actors, and stage staff. The result of this performance is a valuable harvest in theatrical art. This play is a vivid education in revolutionary history for our audience today. The heroic characters and deeds in the play will encourage the broad masses of soldiers and civilians to create new victories in the cause of defending and building socialism!

    评话剧“万水千山”的演出
    编剧、导演：陈其通  中国人民解放军总政治部文艺工作团话剧团演出
    丁里
    反映中国工农红军伟大长征史实的话剧“万水千山”的演出，受到了观众们的热烈欢迎。他们通过舞台上的形象，受到了深刻的革命英雄主义的教育。
    中国工农红军在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，创造了史无前例、惊天动地的二万五千里长征，粉碎了卖国贼蒋介石百万大军的追击、包围和堵截，克服了自然条件所造成的一切艰难和险阻，发扬了坚韧不拔的精神和高度的阶级团结友爱。这支革命的队伍，转战十一省，经受了严重的考验，战胜了一切人为的和自然所造成的困难和灾害，胜利前进，谁也不能阻挡。
    陈其通同志编导的“万水千山”，就表现了这伟大长征的一些重要环节——从红军第二次攻打娄山关开始，经过彝族区，强渡大渡河，过草地，直到攻克腊子口为止。他用饱满的政治热情和对革命事业的无限热爱，通过自己的亲身经历和深刻感受，通过多年创作劳动，才把这伟大的题材搬上舞台，给了观众以深深的感动和强烈的鼓舞。
    剧本“万水千山”之所以获得成功，不仅仅是由于它真实地反映了长征的历史，描写了强渡大渡河、过雪山、走草地……等等具体的事实；主要是因为透过了这些历史事实，突出的表现了战斗的中国工人阶级在极其险恶的革命斗争中的坚强的战斗意志，高尚的阶级品质和革命的乐观主义精神；而这些是通过了作者所塑造的各个不同的典型人物，生动地体现出来的。其次，作者有力地写出了党的领导和政治工作的威力，这是通过了政治教导员李有国而显示出来的。他不是概念的化身，他是与大家一同生活一同战斗的人。作者从一系列的具体的行动中刻划了这个党的领导的代表者，——这是这个剧本获得成功的一个重要因素。再次，作者从紧张战斗的生活中写出了阶级的团结和友情，这是革命部队的重要的特征，如同从李有国与赵志方的关系中所反映的：他们过去是一样的受苦，今天在一起战斗，而又有着一个共同的革命的理想。阶级的共同的命运使他们像兄弟一样巩固地团结起来。这就是战友之间与上下级之间的团结一致的基础。阶级的友爱和巩固的团结产生了不可估量的力量。再如剧中反映了党的民族政策的执行与红军和人民群众的关系等等，都鲜明地表现了这支人民军队的本质。
    这个戏的演出也是成功的。导演、演员、以及舞台艺术工作的各个部门，都尽了最大的努力。
    编导陈其通同志是经过长征的老战士，他所创造的人物，无疑地是他自己最熟悉的人；他的长征生活的经历，他的一切感受，无疑地便是这个演出获得成功的重要因素。
    在这个戏的演出中，导演的成就是什么呢？我以为主要表现在以下几个方面：一、使演员获得了长征的生活，这是一个进行创造和发展想像力的起点，他使人物和事件活在长征的历史生活中，使我们感到真实和强烈的感染力。二、全剧显露着党的思想工作的威力，所有的人物（除了反面人物）虽然有着性格及觉悟程度的差异，但可以鲜明地感到有一种有力的思想——共同的理想和愿望团结着引导着整个部队向着胜利奋勇前进。任何人的任何活动都是向着一个共同的目的，都受同一思想的支配：一定要把中国人民的革命斗争引向新的胜利。从这里产生了革命的乐观主义、坚强的钢铁意志以及磅礴的气魄。正因为如此，在那些艰难、险阻、缺衣、无食、疾病、灾害的困境中，并不使我们感到忧伤、沮丧；相反地，我们感到了一种感人的精神力量在冲激着我们，使我们感到那些人物都是那样雄伟地站立在我们的面前。三、主要人物的性格是鲜明和突出的，如教导员李有国，副营长罗顺成，黄团长，营长赵志方，二连连长王德强，宣传队员李凤莲，以及老船夫等人，都给了我们以深刻的印象。四、导演以豪放的情感，粗大的笔触，鲜明的色彩，来描绘了一些主要的场景和人物；节奏的强烈、情感的饱满，气势的磅礴，也都增强了戏剧的声势和感染力。
    在演员的角色创造上，首先应当提起的是饰教导员李有国的蓝马同志，他在演员艺术上获得了新的成就。提到蓝马我们就会想起他在“万家灯火”和“希望在人间”里所创造的小职员和老教授的形象，那些人物，他是熟悉的。他所体验的旧社会的生活以及对反动统治阶级的黑暗统治的愤懑和仇恨，使他所创造的人物获得了生命，直到今天，还被人记得的。可是，从扮演老教授到扮演教导员李有国，——从扮演小资产阶级的知识分子到扮演工农红军中的政治干部，这在角色创造上是一个巨大的变化。蓝马对这样一个对革命无限忠诚的优秀的红军中的政治干部的形象的创造是成功的。
    他首先努力发掘人物的内心世界，并以此为创作的起点，以处理人物的行动。他所创造的角色，以全部的力量关切着每个同志，从思想上工作上把大家组织起来，并及时地进行宣传鼓动，以保证党的每一个具体战斗任务的完成。这样，李有国这个为了整体的利益而献出了自己生命的优秀干部的形象树立起来了。在动作的处理上，他有意识地注意克服缺乏内在依据的动作，并力求动作的明确，简练和真实。这些努力，对他角色的创造都是很关重要而有决定意义的。在第五幕里，更集中地突现了人物对革命事业的乐观、忠诚和显示了人物的高尚的感情和品质。即使他在难以支持而死去之前，依然以最大的赤诚关怀着中央首长，因为他理解到没有党和毛主席的领导是不行的。他最后说出了：“活马送给总部首长”，“让革命骑着马前进！”——使人感到人物的性格也要飞升起来了。这些都是表现得很好的。许多观众是深深地受到感动的。
    蓝马在不断演出中，使自己的角色有了新的进展，内在的活动更充实了，动作更踏实了，简练了；在最初的演出阶段中的某些繁琐的不切实的动作和某些感情上的不够真实之处，充实了新的东西之后，也使人感到真实可信了，这种不断的加工与修正的创作精神和严肃的创作态度是使它的角色日臻完善的保证。
    当然，不足之处还是有的，比如戏的前面的部分，给人的印象不够深，感到分量轻；第五幕与小周的一段戏也感到有些太轻松了，除了站立不起来与晕倒的动作之外，完全像无病无伤的好人一样，就使人感到不够了。
    其次，饰罗副营长的梁玉儒同志——这个演戏不多的新演员——在这次演出中显露了他的创造的才能。他使我们看到罗顺成这个勇猛善战的人，他对党对革命无限忠诚，但还不能完全摆脱开农民的狭隘落后的思想——闹革命还是在家门口闹；在战场上慓悍，饶勇，但政策观念不强；文化水平低，脑子开不动，领导方式简单，性情又急躁；营长的担子担不起来，自知不行而感到苦恼……等等，属于老罗的这些特性都生动地、鲜明地表现出来了。梁玉儒抓住了这个人物的单纯，耿直的性格，这就抓住了这个工农干部的最本质的特征。当黄团长宣布了师部任命一连连长赵志方代理一营营长的时候，老罗的心情是复杂的。他一方面由于感到自己不能担起领导的担子而非常痛苦，但同时又对赵来代理一营营长而毫无不愉快的情绪（他从前也曾向领导上这么要求过）。这个处理是十分正常的，应该如此的。他痛苦，但不是由于什么个人得失，而是痛感自己的能力不够；……后来，当赵志方要到师部去开会，他把自己的帽子交给赵的时候流露出那样坦率、诚挚和对战友的关怀，就令人非常信服地把老罗的性格突现出来了。
    从戏的二幕以后，老罗的行动少了，或者说已不成为中心人物了，但他在一、二幕已基本上完成了的性格，在后边的几幕中依然不失去它的光采；——这就是性格化的魅力。演员表演得恰如其分，很像是那样一个干部。声音、动作也都应该是为那样的性格所有的。作为对一个新演员来看，这样的成就是令人兴奋的。如果再进一步要求的话，在某些地方，如第二幕，他还是有些不适当的夸张和过火的地方。同时，他还没有能很好地安排和运用自己的力量，——他几乎是平均使用力量的，使人感到他有些吃力和精神消耗过甚。这需要从表演艺术上再加以磨练。演员把自己身上粗糙的东西滤掉越多，那么他的艺术表演就越精练。
    饰黄团长的冯光辉，也是青年演员，他也是演得很好的一个。虽然戏并不多，但使我们明确地看到了一个比较成熟的团指挥员的形象。他对干部是那样严格而又亲如兄弟，他熟悉他的干部，爱他们，而又不放松对他们的教导，他及时地鼓舞着他们不断地前进。当他一出现的时候，信心和力量也就来了。
    冯光辉创造的黄团长，也是使人感到满意的。他创造了一个精神奕奕、朝气勃勃的青年军官的形象。他的人物有着庄严的风度，精力充沛、干练、有才智；他使人感到亲切，他是部队中的一员，而又是杰出的一员；这个形象的创造是成功的。所不足的一点，就是使人感到多少还有一点架子，也就是说，演员所努力追求的形体的动作和造型，还没有在更高的程度上与角色完全融合为一，还有一点人为的痕迹。
    其他如白慧雯的李凤莲、高崑的赵志方、刘一民的二连连长王德强、王纯声的老船夫、白尔纯的小周、周刍的敌军参谋长等，都是性格鲜明、生动的人物，在全剧中都焕发着各自的光采。
    从演员的创造上来看，反面人物是表现得不够真实的。只注意去描摹敌人丑恶的外部特征是不足以揭露敌人反动的本质的。
    描写敌人的高级指挥部是必要的，这对解决下面这个问题是有重大作用的：因为反动头子蒋介石掌握了几百万大军，有着军事优势，为什么会遭受到失败？这个问题要解决得好，这场戏的分量就重了。就会从侧面写出党和毛主席的英明的指挥，以及蒋党蒋军派系之间的矛盾……等等就可以更深刻的展现出来了。
    敌人，是这样的人：他们是极端险恶、狡诈、反动透顶的家伙，他们有着丰富的互相火并的经验，有着帝国主义的支持，他们是认真地、千方百计地要消灭我们，但其结果是无能为力而失败。这是历史的真实。
    对敌人当然是可以讽刺嘲笑的，如果不采取简单的漫画化的办法而是如实地去揭露的话，那么就会讽刺得更深刻更尖锐了。
    最后要谈的是舞台艺术工作。舞台装置、灯光、效果同样是获得了成功的，它在舞台上创造了真实的环境，增强了气氛，它是整个演出的一个有机的组成部分。特别突出的如第一幕：娄山关民团大队部，第二幕：彝族区的古寨，第五幕：草地，尾声的在“腊子口”山顶上——所看到的一望无际的平原等等，都是如诗如画的佳作。
    “万水千山”的演出是很成功的，这是由于导演、演员和舞台工作人员的通力合作所达成的结果。这个演出的成果是演剧艺术上的珍贵的收获。这个戏对我们今天的观众来说是一堂生动的革命历史的教育。剧中的英雄人物和事迹将鼓舞着广大的军民在保卫和建设社会主义的事业上创造新的胜利！
