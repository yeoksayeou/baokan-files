The statement made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on December 8 regarding the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" exposes, before all humanity, the bloody face of the American aggressors who attempt to seize China's territory of Taiwan, create tension in the Far East and the world, and prepare for a new war; it expresses the firm will of the entire Chinese people and all Chinese women to defend the integrity of our motherland's territorial sovereignty and to safeguard world peace. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation fully supports this just statement.

Chinese women have learned from their own experiences that peace is most precious to women, children, and families. When peace is threatened by aggression, it can only be defended by resolutely resisting aggression. If the enemies of peace insist on imposing war on the Chinese people, Chinese women will, as in past wars against aggression, resolutely shoulder the sacred duty of defending the motherland together with the people of the whole country!

The so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is not only an attempt to seize China's territory of Taiwan, expand aggression against China, and prepare for a new war, but also echoes its orchestration of the Paris Agreement in the West, aiming to prepare for a new world war. If this conspiracy is realized, it will surely destroy the peaceful and happy lives of women, children, and families around the world, and plunge the people of the world into the scourge of war again. Therefore, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, on behalf of Chinese women, appeals to all peace-loving women and mothers in Asia and around the world to unite and take practical actions to stop this serious war provocation. Let us fight to defend the peaceful and happy lives of women and children in the Far East and around the world, to ease international tensions, and to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world!

    中华全国民主妇女联合会发言人的谈话
    周恩来外交部长十二月八日关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，在全世界人类的面前，揭露了美国侵略者企图侵占中国领土台湾，制造远东和世界紧张局势，准备新的战争的血腥面目；表达了我全国人民和全国妇女保卫祖国领土主权完整、保卫世界和平的坚决意志。中华全国民主妇女联合会完全拥护这个正义的声明。
    中国妇女从自己切身的经历中体会到和平对妇女、对孩子、对家庭是最可宝贵的，在和平受到侵略威胁时，只有以坚决反抗侵略来保卫和平。如果和平的敌人一定要把战争强加到中国人民的头上，中国妇女也必将和过去历次反对侵略战争一样，坚定地和全国人民一起担负起保卫祖国的神圣职责！
    美国政府和蒋介石卖国集团签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，不仅是企图侵占中国领土台湾，扩大对中国的侵略和准备新的战争，而且同它在西方策划签订巴黎协定相呼应，旨在准备新的世界战争，这种阴谋如果实现，必将毁灭全世界妇女、儿童和家庭的和平幸福生活，使全世界人民重遭战火浩劫。因此中华全国民主妇女联合会代表中国妇女向亚洲和全世界一切爱好和平的妇女们、母亲们呼吁，大家团结起来，用实际行动制止这一严重的战争挑衅。为保卫远东和全世界妇女儿童的和平幸福生活，为缓和国际紧张局势，为保卫远东和世界和平而奋斗！　（新华社）
