The affair of the Whole Party
——A Record of the Agricultural Cooperativization Movement in Southern Shanxi
By Our Correspondent Tian Liu

The agricultural cooperativization movement in southern Shanxi has entered a high tide of great development. Since autumn, more than 190,000 peasant households have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives. Now, this magnificent cooperativization movement is steadily moving forward; by the end of the year, more than 32 percent of the region's peasant households will be organized into agricultural producers' cooperatives.

Southern Shanxi is the "Guanzhong Plain" of Shanxi Province, and its wheat production accounts for more than half of the province's total wheat production, while cotton accounts for 70 percent of the province's total production. Therefore, the victorious progress of the agricultural cooperativization movement in southern Shanxi is of great significance to the agricultural production and socialist transformation of agriculture in Shanxi Province. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to the socialist transformation of agriculture in southern Shanxi. Since the beginning of this year, under the direct leadership of the Provincial Committee, Party organizations at all levels in southern Shanxi have shifted the focus of the Party's leadership to mutual aid and cooperation, in accordance with the principles put forward by the Central Committee.

What are the characteristics of the socialist transformation of agriculture in southern Shanxi in the past year? What is the experience of Party organizations at all levels in leading the agricultural cooperativization movement?

The Whole Party's Cadres Learn to Run Cooperatives

After the large-scale publicity of the General Line last winter and this spring, after the implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and after the study and discussion of the Constitution, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants has been greatly enhanced. Joining agricultural producers' cooperatives and taking the socialist road has become the urgent demand of the broad masses of peasants. In order to meet the needs of this new situation, Party committees at all levels in southern Shanxi have timely changed the past working method of "full-time cadres running cooperatives" to "the whole Party running cooperatives." Of course, going from not knowing to knowing, from a few people knowing to everyone knowing, cannot be achieved easily. Since this spring and summer, Party committees at all levels in various counties have taken many measures and done a lot of work to complete this transformation. In addition to planning to train cadres in batches through meetings and training classes, various counties also assigned cadres familiar with cooperative business to various basic work groups, using experienced people to lead inexperienced people, and masters to teach apprentices, to train cadres in practical work. Many responsible comrades of county Party committees directly participated in cooperative work, studying hard and mastering this movement personally. County committee members participated in leading cooperative construction work in ten work bases in Jieyu County; in order to help cadres learn cooperative business, county committees in many counties such as Linfen and Pinglu compiled small booklets such as "The Superiority of Agricultural Cooperatives" and "Methods for Handling Specific Problems" based on the actual conditions of their counties for cadres to study. In order to correctly implement the policy of socialist transformation of agriculture and improve the level of grassroots Party organizations in leading mutual aid and cooperation, and implement the principle of "the whole Party running cooperatives," all counties have selected village branch secretaries and branch committee members in batches to participate in training classes for key cooperative construction personnel. By the beginning of November, all counties in the region had trained more than 15,000 cooperative construction cadres. The cooperative construction backbone training classes held by various counties were directly presided over by the county Party committees, and the county Party secretaries personally participated in lecturing. At present, Party organizations at all levels throughout the region, from county Party secretaries to village branch secretaries, have mostly learned how to run cooperatives. This major transformation has provided a decisive guarantee for the smooth development of the agricultural cooperativization movement throughout the region.

Constant Preparation, Full Deliberation

The agricultural cooperativization movement in southern Shanxi has been carried out well this year, also because Party committees at all levels have improved their leadership methods for the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the past, all localities prepared hastily and built cooperatives by surprise; this year, they have all changed to constant preparation and full deliberation.

The cooperative construction work of constant preparation and full deliberation is carried out under the further strengthening of socialist education for peasants by the Party. The content of preparation and deliberation basically has two aspects: one is to strengthen the leadership of existing cooperatives, run existing cooperatives seriously, and set up real examples of high output and high income for the broad masses of peasants; the other is to rectify and improve mutual aid teams, strengthen the connection between mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives, and let mutual aid teams be closely linked with agricultural producers' cooperatives, so as to make mutual aid teams more keenly aware of the benefits of cooperatives and increase their enthusiasm for organizing and participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives.

At the beginning of this year's spring plowing, Party committees in various counties organized a large number of cadres to go deep into the countryside to promote spring plowing through mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The Hongzhao County Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized and organized nearly 200 cadres to help 162 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the county formulate spring plowing plans and annual production plans; and helped various agricultural producers' cooperatives rectify labor organization and financial management. In May, it organized more than 100 cadres to help various cooperatives formulate or revise their charters; and helped various cooperatives rectify their organizations and eliminate landlord and rich peasant elements who had infiltrated the cooperatives. Over the past year, the Hongzhao County Committee has held seven meetings of cadres of agricultural producers' cooperatives to study and solve various problems existing in the work and production of the cooperatives.... It is precisely because the Party committee strengthened the leadership of the agricultural producers' cooperatives that 155 of the 162 cooperatives in the county increased production, and 92 percent of the cooperative members increased their income, setting a good example for the county's peasants and vigorously encouraging the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants to take the road of cooperativization. By the end of October, these 162 old cooperatives in Hongzhao County had expanded from the original 3,670 households to more than 8,000 households; in addition, 58 new cooperatives including 1,426 peasant households were established; and 329 new cooperatives had set up their frameworks, determined the number of households, and selected cooperative cadres, waiting only for leadership approval.

The agricultural producers' cooperatives newly established in Jieyu County this year generally began preparations after the wheat harvest, strengthening the leadership of the cooperative construction targets—mutual aid teams: helping mutual aid teams clear up work accounts and calculate work points; leading mutual aid teams to study the democratic life, management system, and work point recording methods of agricultural producers' cooperatives; and mobilizing mutual aid teams to attend cooperative meetings as observers to familiarize themselves with the situation of the cooperatives. Under this situation of cooperatives leading teams, cooperatives promoting teams, and close contact between cooperatives and teams, the mutual aid teams' demands and enthusiasm for "upgrading" (transferring to cooperatives) increased day by day. More than 30,000 mutual aid teams in the southern Shanxi region demanded to be transferred to cooperatives. Many mutual aid teams launched production competitions, added livestock and farm implements, and actively created conditions for transferring to cooperatives; many mutual aid teams often asked cadres: "When will the cooperatives be established? We have been preparing for a year."

Specific Publicity Work

Regularly carrying out socialist education; combining with local conditions, using methods of recollection, comparison, and accounting to publicize the General Line to peasants, publicize the Party's policy of socialist transformation of agriculture; and using the specific achievements of agricultural producers' cooperatives to demonstrate to peasants, etc., these are all important contents of the Party's political work in rural areas, and have also achieved great results: the broad masses of peasants all know that socialism is good, agricultural producers' cooperatives are good, and all support socialism. However, peasants consider problems very carefully and thoughtfully, and they always proceed from their own specific circumstances. They often think: socialism is good, but is it also good for me? Cooperatives can increase production and increase income, but can I also increase income after joining the cooperative? Or: if I work harder, will my income be more than joining an agricultural producer's cooperative?

This shows that in addition to carrying out publicity and education on basic principles for peasants, it is also necessary to carry out publicity that is targeted at the specific ideological concerns of peasants, is specific, and is in line with the actual situation of peasants.

Party committees at all levels in southern Shanxi, in the great development of agricultural producers' cooperatives this year, have particularly strengthened publicity work in this area.

After peasants recognized that socialism is good and agricultural producers' cooperatives are good, due to the different family situations—economic situation, labor situation—there are roughly three concerns that hinder them from actively participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives. Peasant households with more land and less labor are afraid that the cooperative will "distribute dividends based on labor" mainly, and their income will decrease; peasant households with less land and more labor are afraid that the labor organization in the cooperative will not be good, and there will be no work to do, reducing income; peasant households with both land and labor in the middle feel that "it's the same whether you join the cooperative or not, it's not very interesting." In the process of expanding and building cooperatives in various places, grassroots Party organizations have generally selected typical examples from agricultural producers' cooperatives in their own villages and neighboring villages, and carried out specific publicity and education aimed at this situation. When the Nantiti Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Jieyu County was carrying out the expansion of the cooperative, it found three "typical households" of different types among the old cooperative members to publicize the benefits of the agricultural producers' cooperative to the peasants in the village based on their actual situation. These three cooperative members are Zhang Maiwa, Zhang Youguan, and Shi Houmao. Zhang Maiwa is a typical household with less labor, and all seven members of the family can only eat and cannot work. He himself is blind, the others are either old or young, and only his wife is considered a "female labor force." Last year, before joining the cooperative, Zhang Maiwa's family had a total income of 1.05 million yuan; this year, after joining the cooperative, Zhang Maiwa grinds tofu for the cooperative, and his wife participates in the cooperative's field labor, and can earn more than 4.5 million yuan, more than three times that of last year. Zhang Youguan's family is the opposite of Zhang Maiwa's family, with more labor and less land. His family has only ten mu of land, but has eleven members, six of whom are good laborers. Last year, when his family did not join the cooperative, the whole family had a total income of 2.42 million yuan; this year, after joining the cooperative, they can earn 10 million yuan, also more than three times that of last year; Shi Houmao's family is neither as lacking in labor as Zhang Maiwa's family, nor as lacking in land as Zhang Youguan's family, but is a middle-class household. His family's income last year was 1.7 million yuan, and this year, after joining the cooperative, the income increased to 6.2 million yuan, which is almost three times more. After the Nantiti Cooperative publicized the specific situation of these three cooperative members to the peasants, many people who originally had various concerns dispelled their concerns and joined the agricultural producers' cooperative. The Nantiti Cooperative, which originally had only 121 cooperative members, has now expanded to 258 households.

Preventing Deviations, Correcting Shortcomings

This year, the enthusiasm of peasants to run to socialism is unprecedentedly high. Just after autumn, tens of thousands of mutual aid teams demanded to be transformed into agricultural producers' cooperatives, and hundreds of thousands of peasants demanded to join agricultural producers' cooperatives.

In the face of the great development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, some cadres only saw the favorable aspects of the work, and ignored or underestimated the difficult and complex aspects of the work. Some of them were anxious and said, "This year is the great development of agricultural cooperatives. All villages in the township should run cooperatives, and the whole village should run cooperatives," "If we want to do it, we should do large cooperatives. Are small ones still a climax?" As a result, some places skipped the detailed and in-depth ideological mobilization work and adopted methods such as challenge competitions, large-scale registration, door-to-door registration, and "attacking fortresses" to "mobilize" peasants to join the cooperatives. Their reasoning is: "In the period of great development, as long as the majority of people are willing, it doesn't matter if a few people are unwilling," "Anyway, agricultural cooperatives are beneficial to peasants. It doesn't matter if we force them a little. In the future, when their awareness is raised, they will thank this forced cooperation!" The Yangzhuang Township branch secretary in Quwo County launched a challenge at the base cadre meeting, guaranteeing "100% of the village's households will join the cooperative." After returning to the village, he held a series of cadre meetings and mass meetings. He announced, "If you don't join the cooperative this year, you will be a self-employed farmer forever!" Fearing that they would be self-employed farmers forever, 115 peasant households "registered to join the cooperative" one morning. Although these are only isolated examples, the phenomena of cadres' impatience, willingness to run large cooperatives, pursuit of percentages, ignoring ideological work, and coercive orders were by no means isolated in the early stage of the movement.

Under the leadership of the Shanxi Provincial Committee, the Southern Shanxi District Committee of the Communist Party of China timely prevented the already emerging and possibly developing trend of rash advance, and corrected the shortcomings of rough work and lack of attention to ideological mobilization in certain areas in the early stage of the movement. In early October, in addition to issuing instructions to correct the blindly complacent sentiments growing in cadres, the District Committee also sent inspection teams to various places to conduct inspections; the county committees also combined the communication of the spirit of the Provincial Committee's September Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference and adopted various necessary measures: The Hongzhao County Committee sent ten county committee members to go deep into ten work bases throughout the county, and communicated the spirit to more than 1,500 cadres working in rural areas, rural party members, and chairmen of agricultural producers' cooperatives, etc. Through discussion, the bottom line was clarified, and the cadres' blindly complacent, impatient emotions and coercive commanding style were checked and corrected. The plan for developing agricultural producers' cooperatives was re-revised: the original plan to run eighty "cooperativized villages" was reduced to forty-one; the original plan to run the large cooperative with 270 households was also changed to 120 households. ... Because Party organizations at all levels timely prevented and corrected the shortcomings and deviations that occurred in the early stage of the movement, the agricultural cooperativization movement in southern Shanxi moved forward healthily.

In addition to the above, the characteristics and experiences of Party organizations at all levels in southern Shanxi in leading the agricultural cooperativization movement also include paying attention to implementing the Party's class line in the cooperativization movement, and paying attention to combining cooperative construction with production. This does not mean that the agricultural cooperativization movement in southern Shanxi has no shortcomings. There are still many shortcomings in the work. For example, after some counties began the unified purchase of cotton and grain, due to the failure to properly arrange the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, there was a phenomenon of taking care of one thing and losing sight of the other; for example, in a few counties, the sentiment of blindly running large cooperatives among some cadres has not been completely corrected; for example, the more common neglect of rectifying and leading mutual aid teams in various counties, etc., are still shortcomings and deviations in the movement, which require Party committees at all levels to carry out arduous work to improve.

    全党的事
    ——记晋南地区的农业合作化运动
    本报记者　田流
    晋南地区的农业合作化运动，已经进入大发展的高潮，秋季以来，新参加农业生产合作社的农户，已超过十九万户。现在，这个声势壮阔的合作化运动正在稳健地向前发展；到年底，全区百分之三十二以上的农户，将组织到农业生产合作社中来。
    晋南是山西省的“关中平原”，它产的小麦占全省小麦总产量一半以上，棉花占全省产量的百分之七十。因此，晋南地区农业合作化运动的胜利进展，对山西全省的农业生产和农业的社会主义改造事业，是有巨大意义的。中共山西省委十分重视晋南地区农业的社会主义改造工作，今年以来，在省委直接领导下，晋南地区各级党组织，已经根据中央提出的方针，把党的领导重心转移到互助合作方面来。
    一年来晋南地区农业的社会主义改造事业，有哪些特点呢？各级党组织领导农业合作化运动的经验是什么呢？
    全党干部学会办社
    经过去年冬天和今年春天大张旗鼓地宣传总路线，经过粮食统购统销政策的实施，经过宪法的学习和讨论，广大农民的社会主义觉悟，有了很大的提高。参加农业生产合作社，走社会主义的道路，已经成为广大农民的迫切要求。为了适应这一新的形势的需要，晋南地区各级党委及时地改变了过去
  “专职干部办社”的工作方法，转变为“全党办社”。当然，由不会到会，由少数人会到大家都会，不是轻易就能作到的。今年春夏以来，各县党委为了完成这个转变，采取了很多措施，进行了很多工作。各县除有计划地通过会议和训练班，分批培养和训练干部外，还把熟悉办社业务的干部，分别配备在各个基点工作组里面去，用熟手带生手，师傅带徒弟的办法，在实际工作中培养干部。很多县委负责同志都直接参加办社工作，苦学苦钻，亲自掌握这一运动。解虞县十个工作基点中，都有县委委员参加领导建社工作；临汾、平陆等好多县份，为了帮助干部学习办社业务，县委根据本县的实际情况，编印了“农业社的优越性”、“具体问题处理办法”等小册子，供干部学习。为了正确贯彻对农业实行社会主义改造的政策，提高基层党组织领导互助合作工作的水平，贯彻“全党办社”方针，各县都分批地抽调乡支部书记、支部委员参加了建社骨干训练班，到十一月初，全区各县已训练了一万五千多名建社干部。各县举办的建社骨干训练班，都是县委直接主持，县委书记亲自参加讲课的。目前，全区各级党组织，从县委书记到乡村支部书记，大都学会办社了。这一重大的转变，给全区的农业合作化运动的顺利发展提供了决定性的保证。
    常年准备，充分酝酿
    晋南地区今年的农业合作化运动开展得好，还因为各级党委对互助合作运动的领导方法有了改进。过去各地都是仓促准备、突击建社，今年都变为常年准备，充分酝酿了。
    常年准备，充分酝酿的建社工作，是在党进一步加强对农民的社会主义教育下进行的。准备和酝酿的内容，基本上有两方面：一个是加强对现有社的领导，认真办好现有的社，给广大农民树立起产量高、收入多的真实榜样；一个是整顿和提高互助组，加强互助组同农业生产合作社的联系，让互助组同农业生产合作社挂上钩，以便使互助组更亲切地体会到社的好处，提高它组织农业生产合作社、参加农业生产合作社的热情。
    今年春耕刚开始的时候，各地县委都组织了大批干部深入农村，通过互助合作组织推动春耕工作。中共洪赵县委会动员和组织了近二百名干部，帮助全县一百六十二个农业生产合作社制订春耕计划和全年生产计划；帮助各个农业生产合作社整顿劳动组织和财务管理工作。五月，又组织了一百多名干部帮助各个社制订或修订社章；帮助各社整顿了组织，清除了混进社里来的地主、富农分子。一年来，洪赵县委共召开过七次农业生产合作社的干部会议，研究和解决社的工作和生产中存在的各种问题……。正因为党委加强了对农业生产合作社的领导，使全县的一百六十二个社，有一百五十五个增加了生产，使百分之九十二的社员增加了收入，给全县农民树立起了良好的榜样，有力地鼓舞了广大农民走合作化道路的热情。到十月底，洪赵县这一百六十二个老社，便由原来的三千六百七十户，扩大到八千多户；另外又新建立起包括一千四百二十六户农民参加的五十八个社；还有三百二十九个新社搭起了架子、确定了户数、选出了社的干部，只待领导批准了。
    解虞县今年新建立起来的农业生产合作社，一般都是从麦收以后就开始了准备工作，加强了对建社对象——互助组的领导：帮助互助组清理工账、计算工分；领导互助组学习农业生产合作社的民主生活、管理制度和记工方法；发动互助组列席社的会议，使他们熟悉社的情况。在这种社带组、社推动组和社、组密切联系的情况下，互助组“升级”
  （转社）的要求和热情，一天天高涨起来了。晋南全区有三万多个互助组要求转社，很多互助组展开生产竞赛，添置牲口和农具，积极创造转社条件；很多互助组常常问干部：“什么时候办社，我们整准备了一年啦。”
      具体的宣传工作
    经常进行社会主义教育；结合本地情况，用回忆、对比和算账的方法，向农民宣传总路线，宣传党对农业实行社会主义改造的政策；用农业生产合作社的具体成就向农民示范等等，这都是党在农村中的政治工作的重要内容，而且也收到了很大的效果：广大农民都知道社会主义好、农业生产合作社好，都拥护社会主义了。但是，农民考虑问题是很细致很周到的，他们总是从自己的具体情况出发的。他们常常想：社会主义好是好，但对我是不是也那样好呢？社能增加生产、增加收入，但我入社后是不是也能增加收入呢？或者：我自己再加把劲，我的收入会不会比参加农业生产合作社还会多些呢？
    这就说明，除了要向农民进行基本道理的宣传教育以外，还要针对着农民具体的思想顾虑，针锋相对地、切合农民实际情况地进行宣传。
    晋南地区各级党委，在今年农业生产合作社大发展中，特别加强了这方面的宣传工作。
    当农民认识了社会主义好，农业生产合作社好以后，由于他们的家庭状况——经济状况、劳力状况的不同，大体上有这样三种顾虑妨碍着他们积极地参加农业生产合作社。地多劳力少的农户，怕社以
  “劳力分红为主”，自己的收入降低；地少劳力多的农户，又怕社里劳动组织不好，没活干，减少了收入；土地和劳力都在中等的农户，又觉着“入不入社也一样，没大意思”。各地在扩社建社的工作过程中，基层党组织大都从本村、邻村农业生产合作社中选出典型，针对这种情况，进行具体的宣传教育。解虞县南梯村农业生产合作社在进行扩社工作时，在老社员中找出了三户不同类型的“典型户”，用他们的实际情况，向村里的农民宣传农业生产合作社的好处。这三户社员是张麦娃、张友冠和师后茂家。张麦娃是典型的劳力少的户，全家七口人都是能吃不能干的人，他本人是瞎子，别的老的老，小的小，只有他老婆算是个“女劳动力”。去年，没有入社以前，张麦娃家统共收入了一百零五万元；今年入社后，张麦娃给社里磨豆腐，他女人参加社里的田间劳动，共能收入四百五十多万元，超过去年三倍多。张友冠家同张麦娃家正相反，是劳力多土地少的户，他家只有十亩地，却有十一口人，十一口人里有六个好劳动力。去年，他家没入社的时候，全家共收入二百四十二万元；今年入社后，能收入一千万元，也超过去年三倍多；师后茂家既不像张麦娃家那样劳力缺，也不像张友冠家那样土地少，是个中流户。他家去年收入一百七十万元，今年入社以后，收入增加到六百二十万元，差不多也增加了三倍。南梯社把这三户社员的具体情况向农民宣传后，很多本来有着各种各样顾虑的人，打消了顾虑，参加到农业生产合作社里来了，本来只有一百二十一户社员的南梯社，现在已经扩大到二百五十八户了。
      防止偏向，纠正缺点
    今年，农民奔社会主义的热情空前高涨，刚过了秋，数以万计的互助组就要求转为农业生产合作社，数以十万计的农民就要求参加农业生产合作社了。
    在农业生产合作社大发展的形势面前，有些干部只看到了工作中的有利方面，忽视或看轻了工作中困难和复杂的方面。他们有些着急了，说“今年是农业社大发展，全乡要村村办，全村办”，“要搞就搞大社，小了还是高潮？”于是有些地方跳过了细致深入的思想发动工作，采用挑战竞赛、大会报名、挨门登记、“攻碉堡”的办法，来“动员”农民入社了。他们的理由是：“大发展时期，只要大多数人愿意，少数人不愿意也没什”，“反正农业社对农民有利，强迫些也没大要紧，往后他觉悟提高了，还会感谢这个强迫呢！”曲沃县的杨庄乡支部书记，在基点干部会议上发起挑战，保证“全村百分之百的入社”，回村后就连续召开干部会、群众会，他宣布说：“今年要不入社，就永远让他当单干户！”农民怕永远让当单干户，一个早晨就有一百十五户农民“报名入社”了。虽然，这是极个别的例子，但在运动的初期，干部中的急躁情绪，愿意办大社，追求百分数，忽视思想工作，强迫命令等现象，绝不是个别的。
    中共晋南地委会在山西省委的领导下，及时地防止了已经萌芽并可能发展的急躁冒进的偏向，纠正了运动初期某些地区工作粗糙，不重视思想发动工作等缺点。十月初，地委除发出纠正干部中滋长着的盲目自满情绪的指示外，还派出了检查组，分赴各地进行检查；各县县委也结合着传达省委九月互助合作会议精神，采取了各种必要的措施：洪赵县委会派十个县委委员深入全县十个工作基点，向全体在农村进行工作的干部及农村党员、农业生产合作社社长等一千五百多人作了传达，通过讨论，摸清底子，检查和纠正了干部的盲目自满、急躁情绪和强迫命令作风，重新修正了发展农业生产合作社的计划：把原来计划办八十个“合作化的村”，缩减为四十一个；把原来计划办的那个二百七十户的大社，也改为一百二十户了。……由于各地党组织及时地防止和纠正了运动初期发生的缺点和偏向，晋南地区的农业合作化运动，就健康地前进了。
    晋南各级党组织领导农业合作化运动的特点和经验，除上面这些外，还在合作化运动中注意贯彻党的阶级路线、注意使建社和生产相结合等。这不是说，晋南地区的农业合作化运动就没有缺点了。工作中的缺点仍然是不少的。如有的县开始统购棉花、粮食工作后，由于没有把发展农业生产合作社工作适当的进行安排，有顾此失彼的现象；如少数县的部分干部中，盲目办大社的情绪还没有彻底纠正；如各县较普遍地忽视整顿和领导互助组等，仍然是运动中的缺点和偏差，需要各级党委进行艰苦的工作予以改进。
