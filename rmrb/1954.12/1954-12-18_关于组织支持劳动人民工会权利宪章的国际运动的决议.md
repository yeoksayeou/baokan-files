The Council unanimously adopted the Charter of Trade Union Rights of Working People. The Council calls the attention of national trade unions and all trade unions in all countries to the fact that the Charter will assist workers in their united action to defend and fight for trade union rights and democratic freedoms, and that such united action is a necessary means of achieving victory in defending their interests and the economic demands of society.
    The Council recommends to national trade unions, trade union internationals, and all trade unions in all countries: to publicize the Charter among as many workers as possible; to launch a movement to closely link the demands set forth in the Charter with their own struggles to win their other vital demands, and to strive for the broadest possible cooperation and united action among workers of all tendencies—first and foremost, at their workplaces.
    According to the circumstances of each country, submit the Charter to the parliaments and governments of each country, and organize a broad movement to urge government authorities and employers to agree to this Charter, in particular by holding rallies, meetings, and demonstrations, submitting petitions to parliamentarians, and writing letters to United Nations agencies and the International Labor Organization;
    In consideration of the specific circumstances in different industries or different factories and mines, incorporate as many of the demands put forward in the Charter as possible into collective contracts.
    The Council instructs the Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions to distribute the Charter of Trade Union Rights of Working People on its behalf to trade union organizations of all tendencies including the International Confederation

    关于组织支持劳动人民工会权利宪章的国际运动的决议
    理事会一致通过劳动人民工会权利宪章。理事会请各国全国性工会和所有工会注意：宪章在工人维护和争取工会权利和民主自由时的统一行动上将给予它们以帮助，而这种统一行动是维护他们的利益和社会的经济的要求时取得胜利的必要手段。
    理事会向各国全国性工会、各工会国际和所有工会建议：在尽可能多的工人中间宣传宪章；展开一个运动，把宪章中所提出的要求同他们自己争取他们其他切身要求的斗争紧密地联系起来，力求使各种倾向的工人做到最广泛的配合和统一行动——首先在他们工作的地点。
    按照各国的情况，把宪章提交各国议会和各国政府，并且组织一个广泛的运动来促使政府当局和雇主同意这个宪章，特别是通过集会、会议和示威，向议员们提出请愿书，写信给联合国各机构和国际劳工组织；
    在考虑到不同产业或不同厂矿企业中的具体情况的条件下，把宪章中提出的要求尽可能多地订入集体合同。
    理事会责成世界工会联合会书记处代表它把劳动人民工会权利宪章分送给各种倾向的工会组织，包括国际自由工会联合会和基督教工会国际联合会。
    理事会还责成世界工会联合会书记处采取必要的措施在国际上配合并且鼓励这个运动，尤其要广泛宣传宪章和宣传各国工会为支持宪章而组织的行动。
    世界工会联合会应当扩大它在联合国经济及社会理事会和国际劳工组织中的工作，以便使这两个组织的关于保障工会权利的活动比较有效；它应当通过理事会把宪章分送给这些机构，并且采取适当的措施来使这些机构支持宪章。
    世界工会联合会必须给予受压迫的组织和工会活动家以更多的援助，表示同他们团结一致，并且积极地支持他们从事争取工会权利和民主自由的斗争。　（新华社据塔斯社华沙十五日电）
