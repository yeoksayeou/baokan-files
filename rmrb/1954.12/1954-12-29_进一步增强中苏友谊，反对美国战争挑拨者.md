    The Second National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association is opened yesterday. This conference is to summarize the work of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, revise the articles of association, and elect new leadership bodies, so as to further strengthen the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, accelerate the study of the Soviet Union, promote the socialist construction of the motherland, and enhance the strength to defend Asian and world peace. Obviously, this conference is of great significance.

    It has been five years since the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in October 1949. Over the past five years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the care of the People's Government, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has achieved considerable success in its work. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has greatly strengthened the people's understanding of the great significance of Sino-Soviet friendship and enhanced the people's confidence in following the Soviet path and building a better socialist society. It is no exaggeration to say that the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has become the broadest and most intimate organization of our people, and Sino-Soviet friendship has taken deep root and is unbreakable among our people.

    The five years since the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have been five years of increasing development and consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship. The Sino-Soviet talks in October this year pushed this friendship to a new stage. Historical practice has proved that the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, is our Chinese people's closest and most reliable friend and ally. Over the past five years, the Soviet Union has given our country great, selfless, and fraternal assistance. It is because of this assistance that our country has been able to restore and develop its economy in a relatively short period of time, begin large-scale economic construction, develop industrial and agricultural production, and gradually improve the material and cultural life of our people on this basis, so that our country can steadily embark on the road of building socialism. The Chinese people will never forget the Soviet Union's great, selfless, and fraternal assistance.

    The unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union is also clearly manifested in the common will and consistent actions of China and the Soviet Union in international affairs. China and the Soviet Union have always adhered to a peaceful foreign policy, defended world peace, consistently opposed war provocateurs, upheld human justice, and striven to ease international tensions. Since 1950, thanks to the heroic fighting of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies on the Korean battlefield, which severely hit the American aggressors, and thanks to the unremitting efforts of the Soviet Union in the United Nations General Assembly to seek a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the American imperialists were finally forced to accept an armistice in Korea in July 1953. At the Geneva Conference held this year, thanks to the joint efforts of China, the Soviet Union, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the obstruction of the American aggressive bloc was broken, and Indochina achieved peace. The joint statement of the Sino-Soviet Communiqué of October this year on many international issues is a testament to the solidarity and close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in international affairs.

    The deep friendship between China and the Soviet Union and their consistent attitude in international affairs are important factors in stabilizing the international situation and a reliable guarantee for our country's socialist construction and its growing prosperity and strength. With the Soviet Union's great and selfless assistance, our country will be better able and more confident to overcome various difficulties and forge ahead in the great socialist construction. There is no doubt that the consolidation and development of the friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union will greatly strengthen the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and greatly promote the development of world peace forces. Therefore, further strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship is not only in the interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also in the interests of all peace-loving countries and people in the world.

    The consolidation and strengthening of Sino-Soviet friendship is clearly not liked by the imperialist aggressive camp. The American imperialists and their accomplices have been and are using all methods, including rumor-mongering, slander, incitement, threats, intimidation and other despicable and shameless means, in an attempt to undermine the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the people of our country must be highly vigilant to prevent all the enemy's conspiracies and tricks. We must take practical actions to smash the conspiracies of the imperialist reactionaries. We must cherish our friendship with the great Soviet Union as we cherish our own eyes.

    Today, for the Chinese people, a very important task is to strengthen the study of the Soviet Union. To this end, we must further raise our internationalist and patriotic ideological awareness and eliminate the narrow nationalist ideas that still remain in the minds of some people. We must oppose any complacency in our thinking. Because as long as we are infected with the habit of arrogance, we will not be able to learn anything. At the same time, we should also oppose the learning method of mechanically copying and applying Soviet experience without regard to China's actual conditions. We should establish our view of comprehensive and long-term learning from the Soviet Union. We should not only learn the noble political qualities and struggle experience of the Soviet people, but also learn the rich and advanced science and technology of the Soviet people; we should not only learn Soviet social sciences, but also learn Soviet natural sciences. Any neglect in this study is wrong. The process of our socialist construction is the process of learning from the Soviet Union, and it is the process of constantly combining Soviet experience with China's actual conditions. Chairman Mao taught us to sincerely, honestly, and diligently learn from the Soviet Union. This is our motto.

    Today, the American aggressive bloc is creating tensions around the world, attempting to link and expand the aggressive systems of the East and the West in order to prepare for a large-scale war of aggression. The American imperialists are not reconciled to the liberation of the Chinese people and have recently signed a war treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, determined to oppose the Chinese people. Under these circumstances, the friendly unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union is even more important. We oppose the rearmament of West Germany, oppose the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and oppose the US-Chiang war treaty; we must liberate China's territory of Taiwan and will never give up until we reach our goal. Aiming at the American imperialists' conspiracy to actively create a new war, we must strengthen and consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship in all aspects. The more consolidated the friendly unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union, the heavier the blow to the imperialist war provocateurs, and the more powerful it will be to strive for the relaxation of the international situation and prevent the outbreak of a new war.

    Let the provocateurs of a new war tremble before the steel-like unity of the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union!

    Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union!

### 进一步增强中苏友谊，反对美国战争挑拨者

    进一步增强中苏友谊，反对美国战争挑拨者
    中苏友好协会总会第二次全国代表会已于昨日开幕。这次会议是要总结中苏友好协会的工作，修改会章，并选举新的领导机构，借以进一步加强中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，加紧学习苏联，以推进祖国的社会主义建设，增强保卫亚洲和世界和平的力量。显然，这次会议是具有十分重大的意义的。
    从一九四九年十月中苏友好协会总会成立以来，已经五年了。五年来，中苏友好协会总会在中国共产党的领导和人民政府的关怀下，在工作上获得了不少的成绩。中苏友好协会极大地加强了全国人民对中苏友好的巨大意义的认识，提高了人民走苏联的道路、建设美好的社会主义社会的信心。可以毫不夸张地说，中苏友好协会今天已成为我国人民自己的一个最广泛、最亲切的组织，中苏友谊已在我国人民中间根深蒂固、牢不可破了。
    中苏友好协会总会成立的五年，就是中苏友谊日益发展和巩固的五年。今年十月的中苏会谈，又使这种友谊推进到一个新的阶段。历史的实践证明：伟大的社会主义国家苏联，是我们中国人民最亲密最可靠的朋友和同盟者。五年以来，苏联给予我国以伟大无私的兄弟般的援助。由于这些援助，才使我国能在较短时期内恢复和发展了我国的经济，着手进行大规模的经济建设，发展工农业生产，并在这一基础上逐步提高我国人民的物质和文化生活，使我国稳步地走上建设社会主义的道路。中国人民对于苏联这样伟大无私情同手足的援助是永远不能忘怀的。
    中苏两国的牢不可破的友谊，还明确地表现在中苏两国在国际事务中的共同意志和一致的行动上。中苏两国一贯坚持和平外交政策，为保卫世界和平，一贯地反对战争挑拨者，坚持人类的正义，缓和国际紧张局势而斗争。从一九五○年以来，由于中朝两国人民军队在朝鲜战场英勇的作战，沉重地打击了美国侵略者，由于苏联在联合国大会上争取和平解决朝鲜问题的不懈努力，终于迫使美国帝国主义者在一九五三年七月接受在朝鲜停战。在今年举行的日内瓦会议上，由于中苏和越南民主共和国的一致努力，才打破了美国侵略集团的阻挠，使印度支那获得了和平。今年十月的中苏会谈公报中关于两国对许多国际问题的共同声明，更是中苏两国在国际事务中团结一致和密切合作的证明。
    中苏两国的深厚友谊和它们在国际事务中的一致态度，是安定国际局势的重要因素，是我国建设社会主义、日益走向繁荣富强的可靠保障。我国有了苏联的伟大无私的援助，就能在伟大的社会主义建设中更有条件更有信心地克服各种困难，奋勇前进。毫无疑义，中苏两国人民的友谊和团结的巩固与发展，将大大加强以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量，大大促进世界和平力量的发展。因此，进一步加强中苏友谊，就不仅是中苏两国人民的利益，而且是全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民的利益。
    中苏友谊的巩固和加强，显然是帝国主义侵略阵营所不喜欢的。美帝国主义者及其帮凶们曾经并且正在采用一切方法，包括造谣污蔑、挑拨离间、威胁恫吓等等卑鄙无耻的手段，企图破坏中苏两国之间的友谊。因此，我全国人民必须提高警惕，防止敌人的一切阴谋诡计。我们一定要以实际行动来粉碎帝国主义反动派的阴谋诡计。我们要像爱护自己的眼睛一样地爱护我国同伟大苏联的友谊。
    今天，对于中国人民来说，一个十分重要的任务是加强对苏联的学习。为此，我们就必须更进一步提高我们国际主义和爱国主义的思想觉悟，肃清至今还残留在一部分人头脑中的狭隘的民族主义的思想。我们必须反对我们思想中的任何骄傲自满的情绪。因为只要一染上骄傲的习气，我们将会学不到任何一点东西。同时，我们也应当反对不顾中国实际情况，生套硬搬的学习方法。我们应当建立我们全面和长期学习苏联的观点，我们不仅要学习苏联人民的高贵的政治品质和斗争经验，而且要学习苏联人民丰富的先进的科学技术；不但要学习苏联的社会科学，而且还要学习苏联的自然科学。在这个学习中的任何偏废都是错误的。我国社会主义建设的过程就是学习苏联的过程，就是不断以苏联经验和中国实际情况相结合的过程。毛主席教导我们要诚心诚意地学习苏联，老老实实地学习苏联，勤勤恳恳地学习苏联。这就是我们的座右铭。
    今天，美国侵略集团正在全世界制造紧张局势，企图联结和扩大东方和西方的侵略体系，以便准备大规模的侵略战争。美国帝国主义者不甘心于中国人民的解放，最近又同蒋介石卖国集团签订战争条约，坚决同中国人民作对。在这种情况下，中苏两国人民的友好团结更显得异常重要。我们反对重新武装西德，反对东南亚侵略集团，反对美蒋战争条约；我们一定要解放中国领土台湾，不达目的，决不罢休。对准着美帝国主义积极制造新战争的阴谋，我们一定要从一切方面来加强和巩固中苏友谊。中苏两国人民的友好团结越巩固，对于帝国主义战争挑拨者的打击就越沉重，对争取国际局势的缓和、阻止新战争的发生就越有力量。
    让新战争的挑拨者们在中苏两国八亿人民钢铁般的团结前面发抖吧！
    中苏两国间永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
