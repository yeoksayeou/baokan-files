    Resolutely Oppose the U.S.-Chiang "Joint Defense Treaty"
    Chen Qiyou
    Our government and people have repeatedly and solemnly declared: Taiwan is our country's sacred territory, and no one is allowed to forcibly occupy it; liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the sacred task of China's 600 million people, and no external intimidation or threats can prevent us from completing this sacred task. However, the utterly wicked and shameless U.S. aggressive clique, disregarding our warnings, signed a so-called "Joint Defense Treaty" on December 2nd with Chiang Kai-shek, the traitorous enemy of our people, who is spurned and hated by all. This openly aims to use force to occupy our Taiwan and Penghu as its military bases and declares that if our country liberates Taiwan, it can carry out retaliation at any location. What is especially unreasonable is the provision that this "treaty" "shall apply to such other territories as may be determined by common agreement." According to these clauses, the United States can openly and militarily occupy any part of our country and can arbitrarily infringe upon all of our country's sovereignty. The arrogance and unreasonableness of the U.S. imperialists are truly unprecedented. The Chinese people express infinite anger at this open aggression against our country and insult to our great nation by the U.S. aggressors.
    The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, since fleeing to Taiwan, has long been a fish out of water. What qualifications does it have to sign a "treaty"? The reason why the U.S. imperialists want to sign a so-called treaty with this stinking corpse is nothing more than an attempt to "legally" occupy Taiwan and attempt to expand the war of aggression, threatening peace in Asia and even the world. Everyone knows that the "treaty" created single-handedly by the U.S. aggressors will never be recognized by the Chinese people and is absolutely invalid.
    The U.S. imperialists and their followers, in addition to talking nonsense and confusing the public, also use war to threaten our country in order to prevent our people from carrying out the sacred task of liberating Taiwan. We should warn these imperialists: the Chinese people are people who, after more than a hundred years of arduous struggle, have finally gained their independence and freedom from the cruel oppression of various imperialists. We know a lot about all the despicable and dirty tricks of any imperialist aggressors; we have experienced a lot of armed interventions; but the Chinese people have never succumbed to these deceptions and threats. On the contrary, it was not the Chinese people who ultimately failed, but the imperialists who oppressed the Chinese people. If the U.S. imperialists and their followers dare to impose war on the Chinese people, prevent us from liberating Taiwan, or even expand the war of aggression against China, then the fate of the initiators of the past two world wars awaits them.
    The Chinese people are peace-loving, but we will never sacrifice our country's territorial sovereignty for the benefit of imperialism. We oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression against our country and disruption of peace by supporting Chiang Kai-shek, the traitorous enemy of the Chinese people. We remember very clearly how the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique used to exploit and slaughter the Chinese people and sell out the country; today it is still exploiting and slaughtering the people of Taiwan, deceiving and exploiting overseas Chinese, and using the sons of the people of Taiwan and overseas Chinese as cannon fodder, which is something that everyone can see. For the sake of our motherland's territorial integrity and to save our compatriots in Taiwan and overseas Chinese compatriots, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. If the U.S. imperialists and their followers dare to go against the will of the Chinese people and force war upon us, we will fight them to the end. We deeply remember the last sentence in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement: "The Chinese people understand that only by resisting aggression can we defend peace." (Xinhua News Agency)

    坚决反对美蒋“共同防御条约”
    陈其尤
    我国政府和人民曾经多次严正声明：台湾是我国的神圣领土，绝不容许他人强占；解放台湾消灭蒋介石卖国集团是中国六亿人民的神圣任务，任何外来的恫吓和威胁不能阻挠我们完成这一神圣任务的决心。然而万恶无耻的美国侵略集团，竟不顾我们的警告，在十二月二日同为我国人民所唾弃、痛恨的公敌蒋介石卖国贼签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，公开要以武力侵占我国的台湾和澎湖作为它的军事基地，并声称，如我国进行解放台湾，它可以在任何地点上施行报复。尤其无理的是规定此种“条约”“将适用于经共同协议所决定之其他领土”。根据这些条文，美国可以公开武装侵占我国任何地方，并且可以蛮横地任意侵犯我国的一切主权。美帝国主义者的狂妄无理，真是史无前例。中国人民对于美国侵略者这种公开侵略我国并侮辱我伟大民族的行为表示无限的愤怒。
    蒋介石卖国集团自逃到台湾之后，早已成为釜底游魂，他还有什么资格可以签订“条约”。美帝国主义者所以要和这个臭僵尸签订所谓条约，无非企图“合法”占领台湾并企图扩大侵略战争，威胁亚洲以至世界的和平罢了。任何人都知道，美国侵略者所一手造成的“条约”，中国人民是决不承认的，是绝对无效的。
    美帝国主义者和它的追随者们除了胡言乱语淆惑视听外，还拿战争来威胁我国，以阻止我国人民解放台湾的神圣任务。我们应当警告这些帝国主义者：中国人民是经过一百多年艰苦奋斗终于从各个帝国主义的残酷压迫之下获得自己的独立、自由的人民。对于任何帝国主义侵略者们的一切卑鄙龌龊的手段，我们知道得很多；对于各种武力干涉，我们经验得不少；但是中国人民丝毫没有在这些欺骗和威胁之下屈服过。相反地，最后失败的并不是中国人民，而是那些压迫中国人民的帝国主义者。美帝国主义和它的追随者们如果敢于以战争强加于中国人民，阻止我们解放台湾，甚至扩大侵略中国的战争，那么过去两次世界大战的发动者的结局，就在等着它们。
    中国人民是爱好和平的，但是我们决不为帝国主义的利益而牺牲我国的领土主权，我们反对美帝国主义通过扶持中国人民公敌蒋介石卖国贼以侵略我国，破坏和平。蒋介石卖国集团过去如何鱼肉中国人民、出卖国家，我们记得很清；今天它仍在鱼肉台湾人民，欺骗和压榨海外华侨，拿台湾人民和华侨的子弟充炮灰，更是有目共睹的事情。为了祖国的领土完整，拯救台湾同胞和华侨同胞，中国人民是必须解放台湾的。美帝国主义和其追随者们如敢于违背中国人民的意志，硬以战争加于我们，我们一定和它斗争到底。我们深切记取周恩来外长声明中最后一句话：“中国人民懂得，只有反抗侵略，才能保卫和平。”（新华社）
