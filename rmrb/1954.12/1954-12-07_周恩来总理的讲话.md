Mr. Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen:

Today is the thirty-seventh anniversary of the declaration of independence of the Republic of Finland. On behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, I extend warm congratulations to the government of the Republic of Finland and the Finnish people.

Although China and Finland are far apart, the people of both countries share a common desire for friendly cooperation and building their own countries in a peaceful environment. It is precisely because of this desire that the friendship between our two countries has greatly developed over the past four years. Since the signing of the Sino-Finnish-Soviet triangular trade agreement in 1952, with the participation of our two countries' great neighbor, the Soviet Union, which created a good start for Sino-Finnish trade relations, the two countries have signed trade agreements every year, and trade has developed year by year. The implementation of these agreements is satisfactory. In recent days, the negotiations on the 1954 trade supplementary agreement between China and Finland in Beijing have been successfully concluded and will be signed soon. This kind of trade exchange based on equality and mutual benefit will undoubtedly contribute to the prosperity and development of the economies of China and Finland.

Cultural ties between China and Finland have also made considerable progress. I would especially like to mention the visit of the Chinese People's Acrobatic Troupe to Finland in 1952 and the visit of the Finnish cultural delegation headed by Mrs. Kekkonen to China in 1953. These visits left a good impression on the people of both countries, enhanced mutual understanding, and significantly increased the friendly feelings and friendship between the broad masses of people in both countries.

In July of this year, Mr. Lei Renmin, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade of our country, was invited to visit Finland and received a very friendly and warm reception from the Finnish government and people from all walks of life. In September, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Finland, with the agreement of both parties, upgraded their respective embassies and exchanged ambassadors. These all mark a further consolidation and development of the friendly relations between China and Finland.

The friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Finland fully proves that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully and cooperate in a friendly manner. For the benefit of our two peoples and world peace, we still need to continue to develop our economic ties and cultural exchanges, and enhance the friendship and understanding between our two peoples on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

Recently, the United States government is urging relevant countries to approve the Paris Agreements as soon as possible in order to freely arm West Germany; at the same time, it has concluded a so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to legalize the occupation of China's territory Taiwan and expand the war of aggression. These intensified war preparations by the United States in the West and the East have aggravated the international situation, which has been easing since the Korean armistice, and created a new danger of war. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the arming of West Germany and are determined to liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people will make the greatest efforts to defend peace in Asia and the world. I believe that Finland, as a peace-loving Western country, will also make useful contributions to world peace and security.

Let us raise our glasses to the further development and consolidation of the friendship between China and Finland, to world peace, and to the health of Finnish President Paasikivi!

### 周恩来总理的讲话

    周恩来总理的讲话公使先生、女士们、先生们：
    今天是芬兰共和国宣告独立三十七周年的日子，我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，向芬兰共和国政府和芬兰人民致热烈的祝贺。
    中芬两国虽然相距很远，但两国人民都有着友好合作和在和平环境中建设自己国家的共同愿望。正是由于这种愿望，四年来，我们两国的友谊获得了很大的发展。自从一九五二年在我们两国伟大的邻邦——苏联参与下签订了中芬苏三角贸易协定为中芬贸易关系创立了一个良好的开端以后，两国间每年都签订了贸易协定，贸易年年都有发展，这些协定的执行情况是令人满意的。在最近几天，中芬两国在北京进行的一九五四年贸易补充协定的谈判又已完满地达成协议，就快要签字了。这种建立在平等互利基础上的贸易往来，无疑地有助于中芬两国经济的繁荣和发展。
    中芬两国文化联系也已有了相当的进展，我特别要提到一九五二年中国人民杂技团的访问芬兰和一九五三年以吉科宁夫人为首的芬兰文化代表团的访问中国，在两国人民中留下了良好的印象，增进了彼此间的相互了解，使两国广大人民的友好感情和友谊有了显著的增进。
    今年七月我国对外贸易部雷任民副部长应邀访问芬兰，受到芬兰政府和各界人士十分友好而热烈的接待。九月间，中华人民共和国和芬兰共和国经双方同意已将双方使馆升格并互派大使。这都标志着中芬两国友好关系已有了进一步的巩固和发展。
    中芬两国的友好合作的关系充分证明不同社会制度的国家是可以和平共处和友好合作的。为了我们两国人民和世界和平的利益，我们还需要继续在平等互利的基础上，发展我们两国间的经济联系和文化交流，增进我们两国人民的友谊和了解。
    最近，美国政府正在督率有关国家尽速批准巴黎协定，以便放手武装西德；同时，又同蒋介石卖国集团缔结了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图使侵占中国领土台湾合法化和扩大侵略战争。美国在西方和东方的这些加紧备战的措施，使朝鲜停战以来已经趋于缓和的国际局势又严重化起来，造成新的战争危险。中国人民坚决反对武装西德，一定要解放台湾。中国人民将尽最大努力为保卫亚洲和世界和平而奋斗。我相信，芬兰，作为一个爱好和平的西方国家，也一定会努力为世界和平和安全作出有益的贡献。
    让我们为中芬两国的友谊的进一步发展和巩固，为世界和平，为芬兰总统巴锡基维的健康而干杯！
