After the "Reader's Letters" page published the letter from two employees of the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Mining and Industry, "Punish Those Who Suppress Creative Labor," on November 21st, we received a total of thirty-five letters from readers supporting this criticism by November 30th.

A squad of soldiers from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force wrote: "While loyally defending the motherland, we are also constantly concerned about the country's economic construction. When we see every creative invention of the workers in labor production from the newspaper after tense military studies, we are so happy that we forget our fatigue. Because we know that every creative invention of the employees will accelerate the realization of the motherland's socialist industrialization. However, Xuan Tang and others from the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Mining and Industry have suppressed and framed Tang Shiwu, who has contributed to the country's construction. Aren't these people obstacles to socialist construction and criminals of the country?" Yang Shaoying and others from the Shanxi Gu County Iron Plant wrote: "Just as the people of the whole country are carrying out selfless labor for the realization of socialist industrialization, Xuan Tang and other despicable bourgeois individualists are trying every possible means to attack and frame Tang Shiwu, who is engaged in creative labor. This is extremely shameful." They believe that "everyone should unite to remove these obstacles in the road of socialist construction." Liu Caigu of the 4th Detachment of the 316th Regiment of the Chinese People's Volunteers wrote: "When we saw the reader's letter about the 'Tang Shiwu Incident,' an uncontrollable anger surged in our hearts. As a leading cadre, we should resolutely stand firm, grasp principles, implement the policies and instructions of the Party and the government, and cultivate new socialist forces to accelerate national industrialization. However, Li Yifu, as the director of the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Mining and Industry, has forgotten these responsibilities. What he is doing is the opposite—suppressing the new forces of socialist construction and supporting backward, conservative sectarianists. If such people are not given the necessary education, they will continue to bring losses to the country's construction." Lu Ying of the Technology Section of the Jilin Provincial Department of Agriculture wrote: "No small groups and sectarianism are allowed to exist in any department of our Party and state organs, but these problems have long existed in the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Mining and Industry. Can the higher-level leaders of the institute shirk the responsibility of 'bureaucracy'?" Many readers pointed out in their letters: "'The Tang Shiwu Incident' is not just Tang Shiwu's personal problem, but a political issue." Because "the construction of socialism requires the unfolding of a vigorous technical innovation movement, but they (referring to the small sectarian group of the Shanxi Provincial Institute of Mining and Industry) want to obstruct the development of this movement; the country needs thousands of innovators, but they attack and frame these people; the country needs the completion of all production and construction plans to be ahead of schedule, but they obstruct the introduction of advanced production tools into production. Aren't all their behaviors incompatible with the country's construction cause?"

Readers believe that the publication of this letter in the newspaper has powerfully encouraged those who adhere to the truth. They demand that the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party correctly handle this incident.

### 必须严肃地处理“唐世五事件”

    必须严肃地处理“唐世五事件”
    十一月二十一日，“读者来信专页”发表了山西省工矿研究所两个职工的“处分那些压制创造性劳动的人”的来信以后，到十一月三十日止，我们共收到三十五封读者来信支持这一批评。
    中国人民解放军空军某部一个班的战士来信说：“我们在忠诚地保卫祖国的同时，也时刻关心着祖国的经济建设。当我们在紧张的军事学习之后，从报纸上看到工人们在劳动生产中的每一件创造发明时，我们真乐得连疲劳都忘掉了。因为我们知道：职工们每一件创造发明，都会加速祖国社会主义工业化的实现。但是山西省工矿研究所宣唐等人，却对有贡献于祖国建设事业的唐世五横加压制和陷害，这些人难道不正是社会主义建设中的障碍、国家的罪人么？”山西故县铁厂杨绍英等来信说：“正当全国人民都在为着社会主义工业化的实现而进行忘我劳动时，宣唐等这一小撮卑鄙的资产阶级个人主义者，竟千方百计地打击和陷害从事创造性劳动的唐世五。这是极端可耻的。”他们认为“大家应该一致起来扫除这些社会主义建设道路中的障碍”。中国人民志愿军三一六部四大队刘才谷来信说：“当我们看到‘唐世五事件’的读者来信时，内心涌起一股不能遏止的怒火。作为一个领导干部，应当坚决站稳立场和掌握原则，贯彻党和政府的政策和指示，培养社会主义的新生力量，以加速国家工业化。但是李一夫身为山西省工矿研究所的所长，他却把这些职责都忘掉了。他干的是另一回事——压制建设社会主义的新生力量，支持落后、保守的宗派主义分子。这样的人如果不加以必要的教育，将会继续给国家的建设事业带来损失。”吉林省农业厅技术科陆英来信说：“在我们党和国家机关的任何部门，都不容许有任何小集团和宗派主义的存在，但是山西省工矿研究所却长期存在着这些问题。该所的上级领导难道能够推脱‘官僚主义’的责任么？”很多读者来信指出：“‘唐世五事件’不仅是唐世五个人的问题，而是一个政治性的问题。”因为“建设社会主义需要展开轰轰烈烈的技术革新运动，而他们（指山西省工矿研究所的这个小宗派集团）却要阻挠这一运动的发展；国家需要成千上万的革新者，而他们却对这些人进行打击和陷害；国家需要各项生产建设计划的完成都走在时间前面，而他们却阻挠先进生产工具的投入生产。他们的一切行为和国家的建设事业不正是毫不相容吗？”
    读者认为：报纸上发表了这篇来信以后，有力地鼓舞了坚持真理的人。他们要求中共山西省委正确地处理这一事件。
