Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: Commanders and fighters of various arms and services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have angrily denounced the aggressive act of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in signing the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty."

Liu Meicun, combat hero of the Central and Southern Military Region and delegate to the National People's Congress, wrote an article on the night after participating in a military exercise. The article pointed out: The US imperialist act of seizing and attempting to prevent our people from liberating Taiwan seriously threatens our country's security and peace in the Far East. The Chinese people must not tolerate this arrogant act of aggression by US imperialism.

Zhang Fushou, special-class meritorious person of the armored兵部队 troops of the East China Military Region and tank commander, said: "The US-Chiang 'Mutual Defense Treaty' is a war treaty. Only by liberating Taiwan can we eliminate the root of war and guarantee peace in the Far East and the world." He further expressed his firm determination to work with his comrades to make full preparations so as to carry out the glorious task of liberating Taiwan at any time.

Wu Zhenguo, combat hero and special-class meritorious person of the artillery troops of the North China Military Region, said: "The US-Chiang 'treaty' is an open war provocation against the Chinese people, but it absolutely cannot scare us! We must step up training and resolutely prepare to liberate our territory of Taiwan."

Luo Zhengxiang, a gunner on a People's Navy warship, was awarded first-class merit three times during the Liberation War and recently won second-class merit in a naval battle. He said: "US imperialism is trying to use threats and intimidation to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, but this is in vain!" Chen Mingzeng, a second-class meritorious person and squad leader of a certain fleet patrolling the South China Sea of the motherland, also said angrily: "No one can stop us from liberating Taiwan. We must strengthen our maritime combat skills and resolutely work hard to liberate Taiwan, and we will never stop until we achieve our goal!"

Chen Zihua, flight squadron leader of a certain unit of the People's Air Force, said: "Any threat and intimidation from US imperialism can only strengthen our determination to liberate Taiwan and Penghu. We must strive to improve our combat skills and be ready at any time to cooperate with the army and navy to resolutely liberate Taiwan!"

    解放军各兵种部队指战员愤怒表示
    决不能容忍美国强占我领土台湾
    【新华社十六日讯】中国人民解放军陆、海、空军各兵种部队指挥员、战斗员愤怒斥责美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”的侵略行为。
    中南军区战斗英雄、全国人民代表大会代表刘梅村，在参加军事演习后的当天夜里写了一篇文章，文章指出：美帝国主义强占并企图阻止我国人民解放台湾的侵略行为，严重威胁着我国的安全和远东的和平。中国人民决不能容忍美帝国主义这种狂妄的侵略行为。
    华东军区装甲兵部队特等功臣、坦克车长张福寿说：“美蒋‘共同防御条约’就是战争条约，只有解放台湾，才能消灭战争的祸根，保障远东和世界的和平。”他并进一步表示坚决和战友们一起做好充分准备，以便随时执行解放台湾的光荣任务。
    华北军区炮兵部队战斗英雄、特等功臣吴振国说：“美蒋‘条约’是公开地向中国人民的战争挑衅，但是，它绝对吓不住我们！我们一定要加紧训练，坚决为解放我国的领土台湾作好准备。”
    人民海军某舰炮手罗正祥在解放战争中曾立过三次一等功，最近在海战中又立了二等功，他说：
  “美帝国主义企图采取威胁和恫吓的手段来阻止中国人民解放台湾，但这是徒然的！”巡逻在祖国南海上的某舰队的二等功臣、枪炮班长陈明增也愤怒地说：“任何人都不能阻止我们解放台湾。我们一定加强海上作战的本领，坚决为解放台湾而努力，不达目的决不休止！”
    人民空军某部飞行中队长陈子华说：“美帝国主义的任何威胁和恫吓，只能更加加强我们解放台湾和澎湖的决心。我们要努力提高作战技术，随时准备着配合陆、海军坚决解放台湾！”
