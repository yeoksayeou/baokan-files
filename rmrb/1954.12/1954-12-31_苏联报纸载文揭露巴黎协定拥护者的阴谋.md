Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30th: According to TASS, the Moscow newspapers "Izvestia" and "Trud" published articles on the 29th, exposing the conspiracy of the supporters of the Paris Agreement.

	Polyanov wrote in "Izvestia": The events at the Palais Bourbon these past few days show that the supporters of the Paris Agreement are trying their best to confront the French people with the fact of rearming West Germany and drawing West Germany into military blocs. Polyanov emphasized that under the current circumstances, it is impossible for France to ratify the Paris Agreement unless the French parliament is deprived of its freedom of choice, parliamentary rules of procedure are brutally trampled upon, and various political conspiracies and means are employed.

	Polyanov wrote: The French government should have adopted a firm attitude in the face of external pressure and safeguarded the parliament's right to freely decide on issues vital to France. However, the actions of French Prime Minister and his cabinet colleagues prove that they would rather choose another path. Mendès France's raising of a question of confidence when voting on the bill to ratify the Paris Agreement not only shows that he is exerting pressure on the members of the National Assembly, but also shows that the French government is prepared to violate the will of the people and, according to the wishes of Bonn and its patrons across the Atlantic, pave the way for German militarism at all costs.

	"Trud" published an article signed by "Reporter" entitled "The Struggle is Developing." The article said: It is no exaggeration to say that since the Western countries sold out Czechoslovakia in Munich, no country in Europe has been subjected to such open and blatant pressure as France has been in these past few days.

	The article pointed out that the French people's struggle for peace and security and against the new war threat posed by the plan to revive German militarism is growing stronger day by day. The French working people cannot fail to see that the recent developments have once again proved that their deep concerns are justified.

	The article pointed out that experience has shown that whenever France acts according to Washington's wishes, France's fundamental interests are harmed, and it falls into a difficult situation. And whenever France refuses to fulfill Washington's wishes, it can strengthen its position as a major power and promote the easing of international tensions.

	The article concluded by saying that the French people have long rejected the Paris Agreement, and their will cannot be ignored.

    苏联报纸载文揭露巴黎协定拥护者的阴谋
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二十九日莫斯科“消息报”和“劳动报”刊载文章，揭露巴黎协定拥护者的阴谋。
    波利扬诺夫在“消息报”上写道：这几天在波旁宫发生的事情表明，巴黎协定拥护者正在竭力使法国人民面临重新武装西德和把西德拉入军事集团的事实。波利扬诺夫着重指出，在目前的情势下，除非剥夺法国议会的自由选择权，除非粗暴地践踏议会议事规则，除非采用各种政治阴谋和手段，就不可能使法国批准巴黎协定。
    波利扬诺夫写道：法国政府本来应当在外来的压力面前，采取坚决态度，维护议会就法国的切身问题自由作出决定的权利。但是法国总理和他的内阁同僚的行径证明，他们宁愿选择另外一条道路。孟戴斯—弗朗斯在表决关于批准巴黎协定的法案的时候提出的信任问题，不仅表明了他在对国民议会议员施加压力，而且表明了法国政府准备违反人民的意志，按照波恩和它的大西洋彼岸的保护人的心愿，不顾一切地为德国军国主义开辟道路。
      “劳动报”刊载了一篇由“记者”署名的文章，题目叫“斗争在发展中”。文章说：可以毫不夸张地说，自从西方国家在慕尼黑出卖捷克斯洛伐克以来，欧洲还没有一个国家遭到像这几天法国所遭到的如此公开、如此露骨的压力。
    文章指出，法国人民争取和平和安全、反对恢复德国军国主义计划引起的新战争威胁的斗争一天比一天壮大。法国劳动人民不能不看到，最近事态的发展又一次证明，他们的深重的忧虑是正当的。
    文章指出，经验证明，每当法国按照华盛顿的意旨行事的时候，法国的根本利益就要遭到损害，它就要陷于困难的境地。而每当法国拒绝履行华盛顿的意旨的时候，它就能够加强它作为一个大国的地位，促进国际紧张局势的缓和。
    文章最后说，法国人民早已唾弃了巴黎协定，他们的这种意志是不能不考虑的。
