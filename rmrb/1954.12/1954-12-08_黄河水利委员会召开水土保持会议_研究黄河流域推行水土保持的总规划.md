    Yellow River Conservancy Commission Convenes Soil and Water Conservation Meeting
    Researching the Overall Plan for Promoting Soil and Water Conservation in the Yellow River Basin
    From November 2nd to 29th, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission held a soil and water conservation meeting in Zhengzhou. Participants included representatives from the agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry departments of fourteen special districts in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces, as well as representatives from farmers, the Northwest Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Northwest Yellow River Engineering Bureau of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, and seven soil and water conservation promotion stations. Representatives from the Ministry of Water Resources of the People's Republic of China and the Henan Province Huai River Control Headquarters also attended the meeting. The meeting summarized the experiences of key pilot projects on soil and water conservation in the main and tributary streams of the middle reaches of the Yellow River over the past few years and studied the overall plan for promoting soil and water conservation in the Yellow River basin in the future.

    In order to prepare for the fundamental solution to the Yellow River problem and study the solution to soil erosion, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission has made considerable efforts in recent years, starting with a comprehensive understanding and key pilot projects. From 1951 to 1954, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission organized three large-scale comprehensive surveys of the Northwest Plateau, basically completing a comprehensive survey of the 370,000 square kilometer basin area in the middle reaches of the Yellow River and understanding the overall natural landscape and social conditions of these areas. At the same time, soil and water conservation experiments and promotion work were carried out in areas such as Suide in Shaanxi Province and Tianshui and Qingyang in Gansu Province. From 1950 to October 1954, according to incomplete statistics, Gansu (excluding the former Ningxia part) and Shaanxi provinces completed various projects to prevent soil erosion on farmland with a total cultivated area of 1,590,182 mu, afforested 3,522,550 mu, repaired 9,002 gully dams, 6 large and small silt retention dams, 85 silt detention dams, and renovated natural ponds and dug 14 drainage ponds. Effective methods have been obtained to maintain the original appearance of the Loess Plateau to prevent further erosion and to utilize slopes and manage the loess ravines that have been eroded by rainwater on the plateau, and various basic data for further promotion of soil and water conservation work have been collected. In the areas where soil and water conservation pilot projects have been carried out and promoted, soil erosion has been reduced, production has gradually increased, people's lives have begun to improve, and farmers' enthusiasm for soil and water conservation has also increased, creating favorable conditions for further development of soil and water conservation work.

    Based on the requirements of harnessing the Yellow River and the experience gained, the meeting required the leaders in the plateau area of the middle reaches of the Yellow River to further promote soil and water conservation work among farmers, in order to develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and other economies in the plateau area.

    黄河水利委员会召开水土保持会议
    研究黄河流域推行水土保持的总规划
    十一月二日到二十九日，黄河水利委员会在郑州召开了水土保持会议。参加会议的有甘肃、陕西、山西三省十四个专区的农业、林业、水利、畜牧各个部门的代表和农民代表，有中国科学院西北分院、黄河水利委员会西北黄河工程局和七个水土保持推广站的代表。中华人民共和国水利部和河南省治淮指挥部也派代表出席了会议。会议总结了过去几年在黄河中游干、支流重点试办水土保持的经验；并研究了今后在黄河流域推行水土保持的总规划。
    黄河水利委员会为了给根治黄河做好准备，研究解决水土流失问题，几年来从全面了解和重点试办入手做了不少努力。一九五一年到一九五四年间，黄河水利委员会组织了三次对西北高原大规模的全面性的查勘，基本上完成了黄河中游地区三十七万平方公里流域面积的全面查勘，了解了这些地区整个自然面貌和社会状况。与此同时，又以陕西省绥德和甘肃省天水、庆阳等地为重点进行了水土保持的试验和推广工作。一九五○年到一九五四年十月，据不完全统计，甘肃（原宁夏部分没统计在内）和陕西两省，完成各种防止田间水土流失的工程的耕地面积共一百五十九万零一百八十二亩，造林三百五十二万二千五百五十亩，修谷坊九千零二道、大小型的留淤坝各六座、淤地坝八十五道，整修天然池和挖涝池十四个；因而取得了保持黄土高原的原面使不被再冲刷以及利用坡地和治理高原已被雨水冲刷成的黄土沟壑的有效办法，并收集了进一步推行水土保持工作的各种基本资料。在试办和推广水土保持的地区，泥沙冲刷已有减轻，生产逐渐提高，人民生活开始改善，农民对水土保持的积极性也随之增涨，为水土保持工作的进一步开展创造了有利条件。
    会议根据治理黄河的要求和已取得的经验，要求黄河中游高原地区领导农民进一步广泛推行水土保持工作，以发展高原地区的农、林、畜牧等经济。（新华社）
