    老挝国际委员会向老挝停战双方提出建议
    希望停战双方代表共同协商解决政治问题
    【新华社十三日讯】据越南通讯社河内讯：老挝国际监督和监察委员会在十二月四日把关于解决老挝政治问题的一项建议同时送交老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队。建议全文如下：
    甲、老挝国际委员会发现在老挝联合停战委员会中，双方对日内瓦协定第十四条的概念仍旧有着分歧；
    乙、但是，基于日内瓦协定的精神；
    丙、并且考虑到老挝王国政府就日内瓦会议最后宣言第三条的规定所发表的声明；
    丁、考虑到总理苏发努冯亲王在一九五四年十一月二十日所发表的声明和克特首相在十一月二十六日所发表的声明；
    戊、并在正式获悉日内瓦协定中所规定的外国部队的撤退已经在一九五四年十一月十九日完成后；
    己、国际委员会认为：在这种情形下履行日内瓦协定第十四条所规定的政治解决已经没有障碍，前面丙项、丁项中所提到的那些声明已经替双方为达成政治解决而进行直接接触打开了道路。
    因此，国际委员会建议老挝王国政府代表和寮国战斗部队代表共同研究采取措施，以导致包括恢复王国在桑怒省和丰沙里省的管辖在内的政治解决。
