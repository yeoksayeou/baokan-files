As the nationwide mineral prospecting work unfolds on a large scale, the enthusiasm of the people in various places for reporting mineral deposits is growing even higher. This year, one mineral prospecting team, within ten days of arriving at the work site, received fifty-two reports of mineral discoveries from local people. In Hunan Province, an elderly man named Jiang Yizheng, seventy-eight years old, traveled dozens of miles to report a mineral deposit to the prospecting team. In areas like Benxi and Shenyang, some people even reported mineral clues they had discovered more than twenty years ago. In one area, ethnic minority people led the prospecting team to an old copper mine shaft. According to preliminary statistics recently compiled by the Ministry of Geology, the ministry has received 3,488 letters reporting mineral deposits this year alone. A large number of mineral deposit reports directly received by prospecting and exploration teams across the country have not yet been counted. These three thousand plus letters reporting mineral deposits provided a total of five thousand and sixty-three mineral intelligence reports. Among them, there were 1,209 reports of iron ore, 462 of coal, 364 of copper, 262 of lead and zinc, 222 of mica, 101 of gold, 95 of manganese, 87 of petroleum, and others including chromium, nickel, aluminum, tungsten, molybdenum, cobalt, phosphorus, asbestos, etc.

These mineral intelligence reports have played a significant role in prospecting work in various places. For example, the prospecting area of Team 224 was determined after preliminary investigation based on clues reported by the masses. The prospecting of an iron mine in Sichuan was also determined through mass reporting; after prospecting this year, this iron mine can be transferred to preliminary exploration next year. Many prospecting teams have been able to smoothly carry out their work, thereby expanding the scope of known mining areas and improving the prospective evaluation of mining areas, thanks to obtaining mineral deposit information and on-site assistance from the local people.

This year, geological departments and local leading organs have done a lot of organizational work regarding mass reporting of mineral deposits. This year, the Ministry of Geology formulated the "Provisional Measures for Accepting Mass Reporting of Mineral Deposits," which stipulates that letters reporting mineral deposits from people in various places must be registered, numbered, and properly kept. Samples of minerals attached to the letters are to be identified, tested, and analyzed, and the results are to be notified to the reporter. Generally, it is ensured that every letter receives a reply. At the same time, the mineral materials reported by people in various places are scientifically studied to deduce their value and, based on the needs of national industrial development, organized preliminary investigations with a focus and clear objectives.

Leading organs in various places also attach great importance to the work of mass reporting of mineral deposits. The Industry Department of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government specifically convened a working conference on mass reporting of mineral deposits. The Guangdong Provincial People's Government promulgated reward measures for mass reporting of mineral deposits. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Yikezhao League formulated specific measures to mobilize the masses to report mineral deposits. The Shanxi Province's Xinxian Special District compiled mineral specimen and explanatory notes and distributed them to the counties under its jurisdiction to facilitate mass reporting of mineral deposits. In Hunan Province, Linxiang and Yueyang counties made special arrangements for mobilizing the masses to report mineral deposits at district and township cadre meetings and people's congresses in some townships. Provinces such as Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Hebei, Rehe, and Xikang also frequently summarize and send mineral deposit materials reported by the masses to geological departments. All these have enabled the work of mass reporting of mineral deposits to be carried out more deeply and extensively in various places. (Xinhua News Agency)

    群众报矿对普查工作有很大帮助
    随着全国矿产普查工作的大规模展开，各地人民群众报矿的热情更加高涨了。今年有一个矿产普查队在到达工地后的十天内，就受理了当地群众五十二起报矿的事件。湖南省有一位七十八岁的老人姜以政，跑了几十里路向普查队报矿。本溪、沈阳等地有些人民群众把二十几年前发现的矿产线索都报上来了。有一个地区的少数民族群众带领普查大队找到了一个铜矿的老矿洞。地质部最近初步统计了一下，今年光报到部里来的报矿信件就有三千四百八十八件，由全国各地普查队、勘探队直接收到的大批报矿信件还没有计算在内。这三千多封报矿信共提供了五千零六十三处矿产情报。其中铁矿有一千二百零九处，煤四百六十二处，铜三百六十四处，铅锌二百六十二处，云母二百二十二处，金一百零一处，锰九十五处，石油八十七处，其他还有铬、镍、铝、钨、钼、钴、磷、石棉等。
    这些矿产情报对各地普查工作起了很大作用。如二二四队的普查地区，就是根据群众报矿的线索经过预查后确定的。四川有一个铁矿的普查，也是经过群众报矿确定的；这个铁矿经过今年普查后，明年就可以转入初步勘探了。许多普查队由于取得当地人民群众的报矿资料和现场帮助，才使工作顺利展开，从而扩大了已知矿区的范围，提高了矿区的远景评价。（新华社）
    今年地质部门和各地领导机关对群众报矿做了许多组织工作。地质部今年制订了“接受群众报矿暂行办法”，对各地人民群众报矿的信件，都进行登记、编号、保管；对附来的矿样，进行鉴定、化验、分析，并将结果通知报矿人；一般都做到了有信必回。同时对各地人民群众所报的矿产材料，经过科学研究，推断它的价值大小，根据国家工业发展的需要，组织了有重点有目标的预查。
    各地领导机关也很重视群众报矿工作。贵州省人民政府工业厅特别召开群众报矿工作会议。广东省人民政府公布了群众报矿奖励办法。内蒙古自治区伊克昭盟制订了发动群众报矿的具体办法。山西省忻县专署编制矿石标本和说明书，发给所属各县，以便利群众报矿。湖南省临湘、岳阳两县在区乡干部会议和有些乡的人民代表大会上，对发动群众报矿的工作做了专门布置。福建、江苏、浙江、山西、河北、热河、西康等省，也经常把群众报矿材料汇总送给地质部门。这些都使各地群众报矿工作更深入、更广泛地开展起来。（新华社）
