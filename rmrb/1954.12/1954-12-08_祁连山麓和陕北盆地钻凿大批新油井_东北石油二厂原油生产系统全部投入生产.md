    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th. The Northwest region has drilled a large number of new oil wells this year. The new oil wells are distributed in the hilly areas of the Qilian Mountains and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Basin. Some gush crude oil, and some use oil pumping units. Generally, continuous production can be guaranteed.

    In January this year, when the Gobi Desert and the Loess Plateau were still covered with wind and snow, the drilling workers started drilling despite the severe cold. The drilling teams drilling new oil wells in the Yumen Oilfield generally adopted drilling bits adapted to the geological conditions this year and learned from the Soviet Union's rapid drilling experience, averaging 387 meters per month. The No. 1002 drilling team, which has improved its technical level rapidly, drilled a total of five production wells this year. Five other drilling teams created excellent records of actually drilling from 642 meters to 968 meters in one month. In an oil field near the Yanchang Oil Mine, the drilling team used cable tool drilling to drill new oil wells, averaging 254 meters per month, and one well even created a new record of using cable tool drilling to drill 405 meters. Thanks to these achievements, the drilling team working in this oil field completed the drilling plan ahead of schedule in August this year and accepted the additional task of drilling four new oil wells.

    Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 6th. The last part of the crude oil system of the Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 2 was restored and put into operation on December 1st. On that day, this place, which had been producing and repairing for more than a year, suddenly turned into a complete production workshop. All crude oil retorts and gas pipelines were filled with thick, turbid steam, which turned into golden crude oil after passing through the cooling tower and flowed into the oil tank continuously. Up to now, all the crude oil equipment of the Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 2, which had been shut down for more than nine years, has been restarted.

    The crude oil production system of the Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 2 includes the entire artificial petroleum production process of turning oil shale into crude oil. The restoration of this crude oil system began in May last year, and it took only one year to complete the restoration and put it into operation. If a crude oil production system of the same scale were to be built, it would not only require tens of billions of yuan of capital, but also take five or six years to produce.

    祁连山麓和陕北盆地钻凿大批新油井
    东北石油二厂原油生产系统全部投入生产
    【新华社西安七日电】西北区今年钻凿了大批新油井。新油井分布在祁连山麓和陕北盆地的丘陵地带，有的自喷原油，有的用抽油泵汲油，一般都能保证连续生产。
    在今年一月里戈壁滩上和陕北高原还是风雪满天的时候，钻井工人就冒着严寒开钻了。在玉门油田钻凿新油井的钻井队，今年普遍根据地质条件，采用相适应的钻头，学习苏联快速钻井经验，一个月平均能钻三百八十七公尺。技术水平提高得较快的第一零零二钻井队，今年一共钻了五口生产井。还有五个钻井队，创造了一个月实际钻进六百四十二公尺到九百六十八公尺的优良纪录。在延长油矿附近的一个油田里，钻井队用顿钻打新油井，一个月平均打二百五十四公尺，有一口井还创造了利用顿钻打四百零五公尺的新纪录。由于这些成绩，在这个油田工作的钻井队今年八月就提前完成钻井计划，并且又接受了追加的钻四口新油井的任务。
    【新华社抚顺六日电】东北石油二厂最后一部分原油系统，已在十二月一日恢复完成投入生产。当天，这个一年多来一边生产一边在修复的场所，顿时变成了一个完整的生产车间。所有的原油干馏炉、瓦斯管路都漫满了浓浊的蒸汽，这些蒸汽经过冷却塔以后就变成了黄澄澄的原油，源源地流入了油槽。至此，停产九年多的东北石油二厂的整个原油设备，都重新运转起来了。
    东北石油二厂的原油生产系统，包括着把油母页岩变成原油的整个人造石油的生产过程。这个原油系统从去年五月开始恢复，到现在只一年多的时间就全部恢复完成投入生产。如果建设同样规模的原油生产系统，不仅需要几万亿元的资金，并且需要五六年的时间才能生产。
