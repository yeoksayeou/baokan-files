Xinhua News Agency, December 27th dispatch from London: British Sunday newspapers speak frankly about the crude and blatant pressure exerted by Britain and the United States to influence the outcome of the second vote on the issue of arming West Germany.

    The diplomatic observer of the "Sunday Times" pointed out that the full text of the British statement was personally ordered by Eden to be read to reporters in a very special and very solemn official form, "This unusual procedure and the undeniable tone of the statement reveal Whitehall's unease about France's possible rejection of the Paris Accords."

    Many newspapers emphasized the pressure exerted on France, but their tone also showed their deep concern about the possible consequences of such unprecedentedly crude measures.

    The Paris correspondent of "The Observer" wrote: It seems unlikely that the French government will obtain more than 259 votes in favor of the Paris Accords. The newspaper pointed out that the vast majority of members of the National Assembly spent Christmas in their constituencies, meeting with voters, and the warnings they received from there were far more forceful than the statement from the British Foreign Office.

    "The Sunday Times" hinted: "The members of the French National Assembly are primarily concerned with retaining their seats in the next general election. Members seem to be afraid of being condemned in their constituencies for having voted in favor of a new German defense force."

    However, pro-American newspapers place great hope in the behind-the-scenes activities of those who support arming West Germany. For example, the Paris correspondent of "The Sunday Times" wrote that Mendès France and his supporters are attempting to use secret negotiations to pull over twenty or so members, or to make them abstain, in order to get the National Assembly to pass the Paris Accords.

    The "Sunday Times" reporter also worried that since Mendès France's previous optimistic estimates of the mood of the National Assembly were unfounded, the final outcome of the vote is highly doubtful.

    According to Xinhua News Agency: American newspapers now have to admit that the French see Washington and London's reaction to the French National Assembly's rejection of the clauses in the Paris Accords regarding the arming of West Germany as putting pressure on the members, in order to force the members to disregard the will of the French people.

    The "New York Times" published a report from its Paris correspondent, titled "French See Allied Reaction to French Parliamentary Vote as Threat. American and British Concerns Interpreted as Pressure."

    The "New York Times" Paris correspondent wrote: Many French people believe that Washington and London's threats regarding the National Assembly vote are similar to the threats Dulles made when the "European Defense Community" treaty was debated and rejected. When predicting the outcome of the French parliament's vote on the 27th, the reporter had to admit: "Everything indicates that the majority of French citizens still oppose the reconstruction of the German army."

    Washington's threat that it would raise the question of France's ability to make decisions if the agreement were rejected, the reporter said, was answered in Paris with: In this case, the question is not whether a decision can be made, but whether a decision can be made that goes against the overwhelming public opinion against arming West Germany. The reporter treated the French parliament with insulting arrogance, saying that the decisions of the French National Assembly were "absurd actions by some members."

    "The New York Times" commented that the mood of French voters on the issue of arming West Germany "differs greatly from official opinions." The newspaper wrote, "The inconsistency between the official French viewpoint and the mood of the French people has existed ever since Washington first proposed the establishment of a German army in 1950." The newspaper admitted that the French people do not believe the fabricated myth of the "Soviet threat," but are extremely disgusted by the revival of West German armed forces.

    美英报纸承认法国人民坚决反对武装西德
    它们对孟戴斯—弗朗斯能否获得议会信任表示不安
    【新华社二十七日讯】伦敦消息：英国的星期日报纸直言不讳地谈到英国和美国对法国施加粗暴和露骨的压力，企图影响就武装西德问题举行第二次投票的结局。
    “星期日泰晤士报”的外交观察家指出，英国声明全文是艾登亲自命令以十分特别、十分郑重其事的官方形式向各报记者宣读的，“这种异常的程序和声明中的不容分辩的口气，泄露了白厅对于法国可能拒绝巴黎协定的不安情绪”。
    许多报纸着重指出对法国施加的压力，然而它们的语气也表现出它们对这种空前粗暴的措施可能引起的后果表示非常担心。
    “观察家报”驻巴黎记者写道：法国政府似乎很少可能取得超过二百五十九票的赞成巴黎协定的票数。报纸指出，国民议会的绝大多数议员在他们的选区内过圣诞节，和选民会晤，从那里获得的警告比英国外交部的声明有力得多。
    “星期日泰晤士报”暗示：“法国国民议会的议员们主要关心的是要保留他们在下届大选中的席位。议员们似乎害怕在他们选区里被谴责曾经投票赞成德国新国防军。”
    但是，亲美报纸对于拥护武装西德者的幕后活动寄予极大的希望。譬如，“星期日泰晤士报”驻巴黎记者写道，孟戴斯—弗朗斯和他的拥护者企图借助秘密谈判的方式，把二十来个议员拉过来，或者使他们弃权，以便使国民议会通过巴黎协定。
    “星期日泰晤士报”记者同时担心，既然孟戴斯—弗朗斯以前对国民议会情绪的乐观估计毫无根据，那么表决的最后结果如何，是十分值得怀疑的。
    据新华社讯：美国报纸现在不得不承认：法国人把华盛顿和伦敦对法国国民议会拒绝巴黎协定中关于武装西德的条款的反应看成对议员们施加压力，为的是要迫使议员们不考虑法国人民的意志。
    “纽约时报”刊登了它的驻巴黎记者的一篇报道，标题就是“法国人把盟国对法国议会表决的反应看成威胁。美国人和英国人的忧虑被当作压力”。
    “纽约时报”驻巴黎记者写道：许多法国人认为华盛顿和伦敦对国民议会表决的威胁，类似“欧洲防务集团”条约在辩论并且遭到否决时杜勒斯所发出的威胁。记者在预测法国议会二十七日进行表决将有怎样的结果时不得不承认：“一切说明，大多数法国公民仍旧反对重建德国军队。”
    华盛顿威胁说，当协定被否决时要提出法国是否有能力作出决定的问题，据记者说，巴黎对这一点的答复是：在这种情况下，问题不是能不能作出决定，而是能不能作出违背反对武装西德的绝大部分舆论的决定。记者用侮辱傲慢的口吻对待法国议会，说法国国民议会的决定是“一些议员们的荒唐的举动”。
    “纽约时报”评论说，在武装西德问题上法国选民的情绪“和官方的意见有很大分歧”。报纸写道，“从一九五零年华盛顿第一次提出建立德国军队的建议的时候起，法国官方的观点和法国人的情绪的不一致就一直存在。”报纸承认，法国人民不相信捏造的“苏联威胁”的神话，而对复活西德武装力量却是极度反感。
