　　Hold Friendly Exhibition Match in Beijing
　　On the afternoon of the 12th, over 11,000 sports enthusiasts in the capital watched an exciting friendly exhibition match between the "August 1st" Football Team and the China-Soviet Shipbuilding Company Football Team.
　　Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Deng Xiaoping, He Long, and Chen Yi, Vice Premiers of the State Council, Li Jishen and Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee, of the National People's Congress, Dong Biwu, President of the Supreme People's Court, and Zhang Dingcheng, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuracy, watched the match.
　　The "August 1st" team just returned from a visit to Bulgaria and has made great progress in its technique. The China-Soviet Shipbuilding Company team is a football team mainly composed of workers. When they came to Beijing this summer, they drew with the "August 1st" team. After the kickoff, the "August 1st" team attacked against the wind, with the four forwards often cutting into the opponent's territory, and the center forward supporting from behind, posing a great threat to the opponent. Five minutes after the start of the match, the China-Soviet Shipbuilding Company team had a chance to counterattack, and several dangerous balls appeared in front of the "August 1st" team's goal. At the twentieth minute, the "August 1st" team's right midfielder got the ball and passed it to center forward Xing Guifu, who used the space to pass it to right inside forward Chen Keliang, who caught up with a powerful shot, giving the "August 1st" team a 1-0 lead. At the twenty-fifth minute, the "August 1st" team's offensive started again, with left forward Cui Hengxie crossing the ball, and center forward Xing Guifu making a sudden shot from fifteen yards in front of the goal. The ball hit the crossbar and bounced back, and Cui Hengxie caught up and shot again, giving the "August 1st" team another goal, making the score 2-0. At this time, although the China-Soviet Shipbuilding Company team was behind by two points, its offensive did not weaken. Ten minutes after the midfield kickoff, the China-Soviet Shipbuilding Company team's five forwards penetrated the "August 1st" team's penalty area, and a high ball was lobbed in from the back. The "August 1st" team's goalkeeper Huang Zhaowen rushed out to catch the ball, but the China-Soviet Shipbuilding Company team's left inside forward Sun Qiubo suddenly headed the ball first, and the ball fell into the empty goal behind Huang Zhaowen, making the score 2-1. The "August 1st" team did not relax and immediately made a quick pass and cut in. Less than a minute after the center line kickoff, the "August 1st" team's right inside forward Chen Keliang got the ball thirty yards in front of the opponent's goal and shot powerfully. The ball went into the upper left corner of the goal, scoring another point, making the score 3-1. At this time, the audience applauded the "August 1st" team's brave and tenacious fighting spirit. The score remained unchanged until the end of the first half, with the "August 1st" team leading.
　　In the second half, the "August 1st" team still controlled the initiative. Center forward Xing Guifu and left forward Yang Xiasun calmly shot at the opponent's penalty area one after another, but because the shots were too straight, they were all saved by the China-Soviet Shipbuilding Company team's goalkeeper. The China-Soviet Shipbuilding Company team also organized several counterattacks, but did not score. There were no goals scored by either side in the second half. The final score was 3-1, with the "August 1st" team winning.

    “八一”足球队和中苏造船公司足球队
    在北京举行友谊表演赛
    十二日下午，首都一万一千多个体育爱好者观看了“八一”足球队和中苏造船公司足球队的一场精彩的友谊表演赛。
    中华人民共和国副主席朱德，国务院副总理邓小平、贺龙、陈毅，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措，最高人民法院院长董必武，最高人民检察院检察长张鼎丞等观看了球赛。
    “八一”队刚从保加利亚访问归来，技术有很大长进。中苏造船公司队是一个以工人为主组成的足球队，今年夏季来北京时曾和“八一”队打成平局。开球后“八一”队逆风进攻，四前锋常常切入对方腹地，中锋居后策应，给对方很大威胁。开赛后五分钟，中苏造船公司队得机反攻，“八一”队门前也出现几次险球。二十分钟时，“八一”队右前卫得球传给中锋邢桂福，邢桂福利用空档传给右内锋陈克亮赶上一记劲射，“八一”队以一比零先开记录。二十五分钟时，“八一”队攻势又起，左锋崔亨燮传中，中锋邢桂福在门前十五码处举足急射，球正碰大门横木撞回，崔亨燮赶上再射，“八一”队又胜一球，记录为二比零。这时，中苏造船公司队虽输两分，但攻势不衰。中场开球后十分钟，中苏造船公司队五锋深入“八一”队禁区，后方高球吊中，“八一”队守门员黄肇文冲出接球，但中苏造船公司队左内锋孙秋波突然抢先一顶，球竟从黄肇文身后落入空门，记录为二比一。“八一”队毫不松懈，立即快速传球切进。中线开球后还不到一分钟，“八一”队右内锋陈克亮即在对方门前三十码处得球力射，球从大门左上角窜入，再得一分，记录为三比一。这时，观众齐为“八一”队勇敢、顽强的战斗精神鼓掌。此后直到上半场终场时记录未变，“八一”队领先。
    下半场，“八一”队仍然操主动权，中锋邢桂福、左锋杨霞荪先后在对方禁区从容射门，由于射的太正，均为中苏造船公司队守门员救出。中苏造船公司队也组织几次反攻，但未得分。下半场双方各无得失。全场记录为三比一，“八一”队胜。
