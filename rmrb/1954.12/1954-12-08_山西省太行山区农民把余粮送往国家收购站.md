    Farmers in the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi Province are braving the severe cold and treading on ice and snow these days, transporting their surplus grain to state grain purchasing stations. In Wuxiang County, the 32 purchasing stations including Changle Township begin to receive farmers selling grain at dawn every day. In Lucheng County's Lujiazhuang, along the fertile Zhang River, farmers sold 84 percent more surplus grain this year than last year. Before setting out to deliver grain, farmers paraded with drums and gongs. The parade included twelve grain-selling models selected by the farmers, riding on horseback. The grain they sold to the state was repeatedly turned over and dried, and thoroughly sifted, receiving praise from the state grain purchasing station. Members of the Xigou and Chuandi Agricultural Production Cooperatives, led by National People's Congress representatives Li Shunda, Shen Jilan, and Guo Yu'en, collectively delivered their first batch of surplus grain to the state purchasing station ten days ago. Recently, they braved the snow and continuously transported grain to the purchasing station. Farmers in Yaoshanggou and Guojiagou Townships of Wuxiang County, old revolutionary base areas during the Anti-Japanese War, had voluntarily reported selling 425,000 jin of grain by December 1st. Now, while busy delivering grain, farmers are also rushing to grind millet and shell corn. The agricultural production cooperative led by Niu Xingwang, a Communist Party member and hero in the fight against the Japanese during the Anti-Japanese War from Guojiagou Township, sold more than 7,000 jin of grain this year than last year.

    山西省太行山区农民把余粮送往国家收购站
    这几天，山西省太行山区出卖余粮的农民正冒着严寒，踏着冰雪，把余粮源源送往国家粮食收购站。武乡县长乐乡等三十二个收购站每天天刚亮就开始接待卖粮的农民。在肥沃的浊漳河沿岸，潞安县鹿家庄农民今年卖的余粮比去年增加百分之八十四。农民在出发送粮前，敲着锣鼓游行，游行行列中有由农民选出的十二位卖粮模范骑着马。他们卖给国家的粮食经过多次翻晒、筛净，受到国家粮食收购站的表扬。全国人民代表大会代表李顺达、申纪兰、郭玉恩领导的西沟、川底两个农业生产合作社的社员，早在十天以前就把首批出卖的余粮集体送到国家收购站。近日，他们又冒着漫天飞舞的雪花，陆续把粮食送到收购站。抗日战争时期的老革命根据地武乡县窑上沟、郭家沟两乡农民，到十二月一日已自报卖粮四十二万五千斤。现在，农民们一面忙着送粮，一面正在赶碾黄谷和搓剥玉米。郭家沟乡抗日战争时期的杀敌英雄、共产党员牛兴旺领导的农业生产合作社，今年比去年多卖七千多斤粮食。（新华社）
