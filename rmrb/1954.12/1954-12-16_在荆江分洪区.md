		In the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area

	This year, the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Area in Hubei Province diverted and stored water during the Yangtze River flood season, reducing the threat of Yangtze River floods to downstream areas. During the days of the diversion, the people of Jingjiang County, under the organization of the People's Government, moved to safe areas and received meticulous care from the state. At that time, more than two hundred medical workers in Jingjiang County formed twenty-five medical teams to help farmers treat diseases. All those who suffered losses due to the flood diversion received appropriate compensation from the state. The state distributed more than 10 billion yuan in relief funds and more than 9,000 pieces of winter clothing based on the actual situation. Now, more than 300,000 mu of farmland in the county that has been drained of water has been replanted with barley, wheat, peas, and rapeseed. The seedlings of these winter crops are growing strong and lovely.
	Recently, I visited an ordinary farmer's family in Jingjiang County. It was snowing that day, and the wind was blowing hard. I was walking on a road near the Yangtze River. Both sides of the road were lined with houses. After bypassing a small river, I arrived at the door of a farmer's house. "Comrade, it's so cold, come in quickly!" a farmer named Zhu Zhaocai greeted me. He is an old farmer from Dasheng Township, Jingjiang County, who has suffered all his life. Before liberation, Zhu Zhaocai's family had neither fields nor houses. He worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord, and his wife took their three children out to beg for food. It was not until after liberation that they emerged from the dark years. The whole family no longer worries about food or clothing, and their lives are getting better and better. We had just sat down by the fire when we heard the sound of a baby crying in the house. It turned out that Zhu Zhaocai's daughter had just given birth to a son the day before. At this time, his son-in-law, Zhou Changwen, brought the son out of the house. Zhu Zhaocai quickly took him, put him in his arms, and said to me: "In the past years of famine, this child would have starved or frozen to death!" To make the child remember Chairman Mao's kindness, Zhu Zhaocai named him "Xuhong" (meaning "store flood"). This reminded his wife of her deceased children. Thirteen years ago, in a winter after a disaster, her seventh child was born. At that time, she was suffering from illness, eating wild vegetables every day, and had very little milk. On the twenty-ninth day, the child starved to death. Then her three-year-old son also died of hunger and cold.
	We talked about the difficulties his family faced after the flood diversion this year. Zhu Zhaocai replied: "How can there be no difficulties! Now that we have the People's Government, all difficulties can be overcome." He pondered for a while, then pointed to his son standing aside and said: "He got sick shortly after the flood diversion, but thanks to the doctor sent by the People's Government, he was cured quickly, and he was fine in a few days." Talking about the difficulties in production, he said: "At that time, seeds were indeed a big difficulty, and everyone was frowning. But as soon as the flood receded, the People's Government transported a large number of seeds from other places. Later, the government organized us to participate in agricultural production cooperatives, and the difficulties of insufficient manpower and animal power were also overcome." At this time, a feeling of joy and gratitude flowed from his wrinkled face.
	When I said goodbye, Zhu Zhaocai led me through the wind and snow to see the lush vegetables around his house. He said: We now have clothes and food, as long as we know how to plan our lives.

    在荆江分洪区
    新华社记者　田庄
    湖北省荆江分洪区今年在长江洪水期中曾分洪蓄水，减轻了长江洪水对下游地区的威胁。在分洪的日子里，荆江县的人民都在人民政府组织下迁入了安全区，受到了国家无微不至的关怀。当时荆江县二百多个医务工作人员，曾组成了二十五个医疗队，帮助农民治疗疾病。凡因分洪受到损失的人，都得到了国家适当的补偿。国家根据实际情况，发放了一百多亿元的救济款和九千多件寒衣。现在全县已退水的三十多万亩田地，都已抢种了大麦、小麦、豌豆和油菜。这些冬季作物的禾苗，已经长得肥壮可爱了。
    最近，记者在荆江县访问了一个普通农民的家庭。那天正落着雪，风刮得紧，我在一条靠近长江的大路上走着。这条大路的两旁，都住着人家。绕过一条小河，到了一家农户的门口。“同志，天这样冷，快进来吧！”有一个叫朱兆才的农民向我打招呼。他是荆江县大胜乡一个苦了一辈子的老农民。解放以前朱兆才家里没有田也没有房。他给地主当长工，他的妻子带着三个孩子出外讨饭。直到解放以后，他们才从黑暗的年月中走了出来。全家再也不愁吃不愁穿，日子越过越好。我们刚挨着火坐下不久，就听到屋里有婴儿的哭声。原来朱兆才的女儿前天才生下一个儿子。这时，他的女婿周昌文从屋里把儿子抱出来，朱兆才连忙接过去，放在自己的怀里，对我说：“在往年闹饥荒的时候，这孩子不饥，也得冻死哟！”为了让孩子记住毛主席的恩情，朱兆才替他取名叫“蓄洪”。这使他的妻子想起已死去的孩子。十三年前，一个受灾后的冬天，她第七个孩子诞生了，那时她正患着病，每天吃野菜，奶汁很少，到了第二十九天，这个孩子就饿死了。接着她三岁的儿子，也因饥、冻而死去了。
    我们谈到了今年分洪后他家的困难问题。朱兆才回答说：“哪能没有困难！如今有了人民政府，什么困难都能克服了。”他沉思了一会，接着就指着站在一旁的儿子说：“分洪不久，他就得了病，多亏人民政府派来的医生治得快，没几天就好了。”谈到生产上的困难，他说：“当时种籽的确是个大困难，人人都愁眉苦脸的。可是洪水刚退，人民政府就从外地运来了大批种籽，以后政府又组织我们参加了农业生产合作社，人力、畜力不足的困难，也就克服了。”这时从他满刻着皱纹的脸上，流露着喜悦和感激的心情。
    当我告别时，在风雪中，朱兆才引我到他的房子四周，看了看那些长得肥壮的蔬菜。他说：我们现在有衣有粮，只要过日子会打算就行了。
