    Hunan and Guangdong Mass-Produce New-Style Farm Tools
    The relatively large state-owned Jianxiang Machinery Factory in Hunan will switch entirely to the production of new-style farm tools starting next year. Next year, this factory will supply state-owned farms and general farmers with 17,500 double-wheeled double-shared plows, 500 threshing machines, 200 paddy field plows, 161 Soviet-style tractor-drawn cotton planters for large-scale farms, and 150 Czechoslovakian-style four-wheeled dump trucks. Recently, the factory has sent technicians and skilled workers to the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory to learn the technology of manufacturing farm tools. Furthermore, employee-organized survey teams have been dispatched to rural areas to investigate the use of new-style farm tools and solicit farmers' opinions on the manufacturing of new-style farm tools.

    Farm tool and machinery factories in Guangdong Province have already begun producing the new-style farm tools originally scheduled for production next year. Twenty thousand "May 1st"-style paddy field plows will be completed before January of next year to supply farmers for spring plowing. Within the coming year, farm tool and machinery factories throughout the province will produce 40,000 "May 1st"-style paddy field plows, more than 4,000 threshing machines, water pumps, and other farm tools, as well as a large number of sprayers and cultivators, for the farmers.
    Recently, the Industry Department of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government convened a conference on the farm tool and machinery industry, which tentatively determined the specific division of labor for the province's fourteen farm tool and machinery factories. Based on Guangdong's plan to vigorously promote new-style farm tools in agriculture next year, the production tasks for new-style farm tools in 1955 were arranged. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖南广东大量制造新式农具
    湖南地方国营较大的建湘机械厂，明年起将全部生产新式农具。这个厂明年将供应国营农场和一般农民双轮双铧犁一万七千五百部，打稻机五百部，水田犁二百部，大型农场用的苏联式机引棉花播种机一百六十一台，捷克斯洛伐克式四轮倒卸拖车一百五十部。最近，这个厂已派技术员和技工到北京农业机械厂学习制造农具的技术；并由职工组成三个调查小组分赴各地农村，研究使用新式农具情况和听取农民对制造新式农具的意见。

    广东省各农具机械工厂已开始生产原定明年生产的新式农具。有两万部五一式水田犁在明年一月以前就可以做好，供应农民春耕使用。明年一年内，全省的农具机械工厂将要为农民生产五一式水田犁四万部，打禾机、抽水机和其他农具四千多部，还有大量的喷雾器和中耕器。
    最近广东省人民政府工业厅召开了农具机械工业会议，初步确定了全省十四个农具机械工厂的具体分工，并根据广东省农业方面明年大力推广新式农具的计划，安排了一九五五年新式农具的生产任务。（新华社）
