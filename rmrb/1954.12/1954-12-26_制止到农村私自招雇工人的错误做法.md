Editor's Note: According to the reply from the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources, the one hundred and seventy migrant workers who were privately recruited were all demobilized and returned home at the end of November. They have instructed the First Mechanical Engineering Corps to conduct a self-criticism and to prevent similar incidents from recurring in the future.

(I) To the Editor:

    Certain units under the Qinhuangdao Engineering Section of the Guye Transportation Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau do not comply with the unified labor force allocation policy and frequently privately recruit workers in Tangshan City.

    Since 1953, the Beijiadian Road Maintenance Area has been constantly privately recruiting workers. Every time the People's Government of District Seven of Tangshan City discovered this, they explained the policy to them and asked them to dismiss the privately recruited workers and send them home; each time, they expressed that they would definitely implement the policy in the future. However, in September, they privately recruited another twenty-six workers. When the district government went to inspect, they first said that they "did not understand the procedures for recruiting workers," and later offered a "firm guarantee" to "correct in the future." But on October 7th, there was another incident of privately recruiting six workers.

    In September, the Weifengshan Road Maintenance Area privately recruited twenty-six workers. All of them were farmers from Weifengshan Township, accounting for more than 20% of the township's total agricultural labor force, which had a great impact on local agricultural production. The district government asked them to dismiss the recruited workers, but they kept the rich peasant element Wei Gong. The local people reacted very negatively.

    Similar phenomena also exist in other units under the Qinhuangdao Engineering Section. We reported the situation to the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee of the CCP. After the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee informed the railway department, we soon received a reply from the Political Department of the Guye Transportation Branch forwarded by the Qinhuangdao Engineering Section on November 13, stating that the temporary workers privately hired by the Beijiadian and Weifengshan Road Maintenance Areas had been dismissed. However, according to our understanding, the Beijiadian Road Maintenance Area was still privately employing seventeen workers on the 15th, two of whom were newly recruited that day; the Weifengshan Road Maintenance Area was still privately employing sixteen workers on the 16th. After we raised our concerns, they dismissed these workers; however, Du Guozhong, the foreman of the Weifengshan Road Maintenance Area, expressed his unwillingness to implement the policy of unified labor force allocation.

    We hope that the Qinhuangdao Engineering Section will educate its subordinate units to understand the unified labor force allocation policy and earnestly correct the wrong practice of privately recruiting workers in the future.

(II) To the Editor:

    On October 31st of this year, cadres from the Labor and Wage Section of the First Mechanical Engineering Corps of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources went to Xicetian Township, Yanggao County, to recruit migrant workers. They did not contact our county's labor department beforehand, nor did they come to the county to sign a contract afterward. On November 1st, the County People's Government received a phone report from the cadres who went to the villages, and immediately called to stop this practice; however, one hundred and seventy migrant workers had already left.

    A small number of villages in our county suffered from natural disasters this year. The County People's Government had already formulated a labor force transportation plan in conjunction with production and disaster relief work. Xicetian Township is not a disaster area. The First Mechanical Engineering Corps' private recruitment there not only disrupted our county's labor force transportation plan and affected the disaster area's production and self-rescue work, but also had a bad influence on the masses of peasants.

### 制止到农村私自招雇工人的错误做法

    制止到农村私自招雇工人的错误做法
    编者按：据水利部工程总局答复，私自招雇的一百七十名民工已在十一月底全部复员回家。他们已责成第一机械工程总队进行检讨，并在今后防止类似事件继续发生。
    （一）编辑同志：
    天津铁路管理局古冶运输分局秦皇岛工务段所属某些单位不遵守劳动力统一调配政策，经常在唐山市私自招雇工人。
    卑家店养路工区从一九五三年以来，就不断私招工人。唐山市七区人民政府每次发现后向他们讲清政策，要求把私招的工人解雇回家；他们也每次表示以后一定要执行政策。到九月份，他们又私招工人二十六人。区政府去检查时，他们先说是“不了解招雇工人手续”，后来又提出了“今后改正”的“坚决保证”。但是到十月七日又发生了私自招雇工人六名的事件。
    巍峰山养路工区九月份私招工人二十六人。都是巍峰山乡的农民，占全乡农业劳动力总数的百分之二十以上，这对当地农业生产有很大影响。区政府让他们把招收的工人解雇，他们却把富农分子魏功留下了。当地群众反映很坏。
    类似现象，在秦皇岛工务段所属其它一些单位也有。我们把情况向中共唐山市委反映。经唐山市委转告铁路部门，不久就接到古冶运输分局政治处转来秦皇岛工务段十一月十三日的答复，说是卑家店、巍峰山两工区私自雇用的临时工已经解雇。但是，据我们了解，卑家店养路工区在十五日仍然私雇着十七个工人，其中有两名还是那天新招的；巍峰山养路工区在十六日也仍私雇着工人十六名。经我们提出意见后，他们才把这些工人解雇了；但巍峰山养路工区工长杜国忠还表示不愿意执行统一调配劳动力的政策。
    我们希望秦皇岛工务段教育所属单位认识劳动力统一调配政策，今后切实纠正私自招雇工人的错误做法。

    （二）编辑同志：
    今年十月三十一日，水利部工程总局第一机械工程总队劳动工资科派干部到阳高县西册田乡招雇民工。他们事先并没有同我县劳动部门联系，事后也不到县里来签订合同。十一月一日，县人民政府接到下乡干部的电话报告，就打电话去制止这种做法；但已经走了一百七十个民工。
    我县有少数村庄今年遭受了自然灾害，县人民政府早就结合生产救灾工作制订了劳动力的输送计划。西册田乡并不是灾区，第一机械工程总队到那里去私行招工，不但打乱了我县的劳动力输送计划，影响了灾区的生产自救工作，并且在农民群众中造成了不好的影响。
