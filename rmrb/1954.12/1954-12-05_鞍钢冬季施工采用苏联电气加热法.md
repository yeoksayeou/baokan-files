Since the first snowfall on November 15th, various basic construction sites at Anshan Iron and Steel Works have comprehensively begun winter construction by adopting advanced Soviet winter construction methods such as electrical heating, steam heating, and mixed heating.

Among these winter construction methods, the electrical heating construction method is the most advanced Soviet method, far superior to steam heating and mixed heating. When using steam heating and mixed heating construction methods, it is necessary to build warm sheds, repair boilers, and install pipelines. However, with the electrical heating construction method, only transformers, thermometers, and some wires connected to the concrete reinforcement are needed. The electrical heating method is more suitable for dispersed construction sites, and the cost is half that of steam heating and mixed heating. In addition, electrical heating is faster and better than steam heating and mixed heating. Steam heating and mixed heating heat from the outside in, and the curing period for a concrete foundation takes more than twenty days. If the weather changes suddenly, the time needs to be extended, and sometimes the quality cannot be fully guaranteed. Using electrical heating, electricity is used to heat the steel bars inside the foundation to a certain temperature, heating from the inside out. The curing period for the same concrete foundation only takes four or five days. Even in severe weather conditions, the quality will not be affected.

Last year, the basic construction sites at Anshan Iron and Steel Works tested the electrical heating method, and this year it has been officially adopted. Recently, basic construction departments from Shenyang, Fuxin, and other places have sent people to Anshan Iron and Steel Works to learn this advanced construction method.

### 鞍钢冬季施工采用苏联电气加热法

    鞍钢冬季施工采用苏联电气加热法
    从十一月十五日第一次飘雪以来，鞍钢各基本建设工地就分别采用了电气加热、蒸气加热、混合加热等苏联的先进冬季施工方法，全面地开始了冬季施工。
    在这些冬季施工方法中，电气加热施工法是苏联最先进的一种施工方法，它比蒸气加热和混合加热都要优越得多。采用蒸气加热和混合加热施工法，要盖暖棚、修锅炉，通管道等；采用电气加热施工法，只要有变压器、温度计和一些通往混凝土钢筋上的电线就行了。电气加热法更适合于工地分散的情况，并且成本比蒸气加热和混合加热降低一半。此外，电气加热也比蒸气加热和混合加热又快又好。蒸气加热和混合加热是由外面向里加热，一个混凝土基础的养生期间就要二十多天，遇到天气骤然变化，时间还要延长，有时还不能完全保证质量。用电气加热，是用电把基础内部的钢筋烧到一定的温度，从里往外加热，同样一个混凝土基础的养生期间只要四、五天就行了。在天气恶劣的情况下，质量都不会受影响。
    去年鞍钢基本建设工地曾试用过电气加热法，今年开始正式采用。最近，沈阳、阜新等地基本建设部门，已派人到鞍钢学习这一先进施工方法。
