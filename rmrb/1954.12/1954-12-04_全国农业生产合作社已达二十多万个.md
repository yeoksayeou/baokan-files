    National Agricultural Production Cooperatives Reach Over 200,000
    The agricultural cooperation movement across the country has achieved new progress. According to statistics, as of the autumn of this year, there are already 225,405 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide. Among them, 130,405 cooperatives were established during the period from spring to autumn; 95,000 cooperatives were established before spring plowing. The distribution of these cooperatives is as follows: North China has 79,538, Northeast China has 60,340, East China has 46,045, Central South China has 18,232, Southwest China has 17,745, and Northwest China has 3,505. Mutual aid teams have also developed significantly during this period. Currently, households participating in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams account for more than 60% of the total number of farm households nationwide.
    After the spring plowing, based on the experience of setting up cooperatives before spring, various regions adopted the method of preparing throughout the year and developing in batches, generally selecting a group of mutual aid teams as targets for establishing cooperatives. In Henan, Hunan, and Heilongjiang provinces alone, 90,300 mutual aid teams were cultivated during this period. Other provinces also cultivated varying numbers of mutual aid teams. While cultivating mutual aid teams, various regions used local real-life stories to educate mutual aid team members about the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, and utilized production gaps to train key personnel for establishing cooperatives. According to incomplete statistics from Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hunan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, and other provinces, more than 375,400 agricultural production cooperative chairpersons, accountants, production team leaders, and district and township cadres leading the cooperatives were trained. Then, various regions developed and established cooperatives in batches according to local conditions. The cooperatives newly established in various regions before autumn were all established on the basis of better mutual aid teams.
    With the large-scale development of cooperatives, various regions also carried out rectification work; preparing a batch, developing a batch, consolidating a batch, and then preparing another batch. After classifying and ranking 8,207 cooperatives in Tangxian, Anxin, and nine other counties in Hebei Province, not only were 3,344 cooperatives with a better foundation and stronger leadership improved, but also 4,863 cooperatives with a poor foundation, weak key personnel, and chaotic internal production were rectified. In many places, during the review and rectification process, issues such as land evaluation and asset assessment and the entry of farm tools and livestock into the cooperatives were resolved, landlords and rich peasant elements who had infiltrated the cooperatives were cleared out, and agricultural and sideline production plans were developed to help agricultural production cooperatives.
    This time, various regions adopted the method of "establishing cooperatives while producing," grasping the principle of establishing cooperatives from production and promoting production through the establishment of cooperatives. Among the 1,952 cooperatives established in Xinxian District, Shanxi Province, 1,293 cooperatives accumulated more than 800,000 dan of fertilizer, reclaimed 2,848 mu of wasteland, planted more than 10,000 mu of wheat, and accumulated 86.38 million yuan in public funds. Through the establishment of cooperatives, Yuhang County, Zhejiang Province, led farmers to increase 4,500 mu of double-cropping rice, basically eliminated wasteland and idle land in the county, and expanded the autumn耕面积 by 5,100 mu. In the first batch of cooperatives established in Guangwu District, Jieshou County, Anhui Province, 233 wells were drilled and repaired.
    According to the inspection results of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at all levels, 90% of the agricultural production cooperatives established before spring plowing have increased production, and the income of cooperative members has generally increased; the cooperatives established after spring and before autumn are also basically up to requirements. However, some cooperatives have done a poor job in ideological education, and the implementation of the Party's class policy in rural areas is not sufficient, so some cooperatives are established relatively coarsely; some places focus on setting up cooperatives and relax production; they are greedy for setting up large cooperatives and do not set up small cooperatives; and some places abandon old cooperatives while setting up new cooperatives, and neglect the development of mutual aid teams. Now, the CPC organizations at all levels are actively taking measures to overcome these shortcomings. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 全国农业生产合作社已达二十多万个

    全国农业生产合作社已达二十多万个
    全国各地农业合作化运动又得到新的进展。据统计，截至今年秋前止，全国已有二十二万五千四百零五个农业生产合作社。其中十三万零四百零五个社是在春后秋前这段时期内建立的；九万五千个社是在春耕前建立的。这些社的分布状况如下：华北地区七万九千五百三十八个，东北地区六万零三百四十个，华东地区四万六千零四十五个，中南地区一万八千二百三十二个，西南地区一万七千七百四十五个，西北地区三千五百零五个。互助组在这一时期内也得到大量的发展。现在参加农业生产合作社和互助组的农户，已占全国总农户百分之六十以上。
    春耕之后，各地根据春前办社的经验，都采取了全年准备，分批发展的建社办法，普遍选择了一批互助组为建社对象。仅河南、湖南、黑龙江三省，在这一时期内就培养了九万零三百个互助组。其他各省也培养了数量不等的互助组。和培养互助组同时，各地都运用当地真人真事向互助组组员进行农业生产合作社优越性的教育，并利用生产空隙，普遍训练了建社骨干分子。据江苏、安徽、河南、湖南、四川、陕西、黑龙江等省不完全统计，就训练了三十七万五千四百多农业生产合作社社长、会计、生产队长和领导社的区、乡干部。然后各地根据当地的条件，分批发展，分批建立。秋前各地新办的社都是在较好的互助组基础上建立起来的。
    随着社的大量发展，各地又进行了整顿工作；准备一批，发展一批，巩固一批，又准备一批。河北省唐县、安新等十一个县的八千二百零七个社，经过分类排队后，不仅提高了基础较好、领导力量较强的三千三百四十四个社，而且整顿了基础差、骨干分子弱、社内生产较乱的四千八百六十三个社。许多地方在审查和整顿中，解决了社内遗留的土地评产和农具、牲畜入社问题，清除了混入社内的地主和富农分子，并帮助农业生产合作社制订了农业和副业生产计划。
    这次各地都采取“边建社、边生产”的办法，掌握从生产中建社，通过建社推动生产的方针。山西省忻县专区建立的一千九百五十二个社，其中有一千二百九十三个社共积肥八十多万担，开荒地两千八百四十八亩，种小麦一万多亩，积累公积金八千六百三十八万元。浙江省余杭县通过办社，带动农民增加了四千五百亩双季连作稻，基本上消灭了全县荒田和空闲地，扩大了秋耕面积五千一百亩。安徽省界首县光武区第一批办社中，即打井和修井二百三十三口。
    根据中共各级地方组织检查结果：春耕前建立起来的农业生产合作社，百分之九十得到增产，社员收入普遍增加；春后秋前建立起来的社，基本上也是合乎要求的。但还有些社思想教育工作做的较差，贯彻党在农村中的阶级政策不够，因而有些社建立的较粗糙；还有些地方偏重办社，放松生产；贪办大社、不办小社；还有些地方办了新社，丢了老社，忽视互助组发展。现在中共各级地方组织正积极采取措施加以克服。　（新华社）
