Xinhua News Agency, London, December 16th. TASS, London, December 15th: A mass meeting was held on December 14th at the Ealing Town Hall in London, marking the beginning of the campaign launched by the British Communist Party to mobilize the British people to join the struggle against the arming of West Germany. Such mass meetings are to be held throughout Britain from now until mid-January.

    British Communist Party General Secretary Harry Pollitt spoke at the meeting. He emphasized the importance of working-class unity, as the working class must lead the British peace forces in the struggle against the arming of West Germany.

    Pollitt said: "If we smash the plan to rearm Germany (which we can do), then this will be the heaviest blow to the warmongers." Pollitt pointed out that the danger of rearming West Germany should not be underestimated. A divided Germany itself is a threat to world peace. Precisely for this reason, the Soviet government has long been striving to restore the unification of Germany through peaceful means, by negotiations between East and West.

    Pollitt pointed out that the Western countries refused to participate in the Moscow European countries' conference, and he exposed the propaganda that the ratification of the Nine-Power (London) Agreement could promote negotiations between the Soviet Union and the Western countries. Pollitt said: "If the agreement is ratified, then there will be no further negotiations. If West Germany is rearmed, then what issues remain to be discussed in Europe? Ratifying the Paris Agreements would render negotiations on restoring German unification meaningless and would eliminate the possibility of reaching an agreement on this issue."

    Pollitt pointed out that in the struggle against the ratification of the Paris Agreements, the British people have the working classes of Germany, France, and other countries as their important allies, whose working classes are equally concerned about the threat to peace posed by the remilitarization of West Germany.

    Referring to the debate in the House of Commons on the Paris Agreements, Pollitt pointed out that only forty percent of the members of parliament favored the agreement. In Britain, opposition to the arming of West Germany is so strong that the majority of Labour MPs abstained from the vote.

    英共发起大规模的反对武装西德的运动
    波立特号召英国人民积极参加这一斗争
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：十二月十四日，在伦敦伊林区市政厅举行了一次群众大会，英国共产党所发起的发动英国人民投入反对武装西德斗争的运动从此开始了。从现在到明年一月中旬，全英国都要举行这样的群众大会。
    英国共产党总书记波立特在会上讲了话。他指出工人阶级团结的重要性，因为工人阶级要领导英国和平力量进行反对武装西德的斗争。
    波立特说：“如果我们粉碎了重新武装德国的计划（我们是可以做到这一点的），那末这就是对战争贩子的最沉重的一次打击。”波立特指出，不应过低估计重新武装西德的危险性。被分裂的德国本身就是对世界和平的威胁。正因为这样，苏联政府很早就在争取通过东、西方谈判的途径，用和平办法来恢复德国的统一。
    波立特指出西方国家拒绝参加莫斯科欧洲国家会议，他揭露了这样的宣传：似乎批准九国（伦敦）协定能够促成苏联和西方国家之间的谈判。波立特说：“如果协定被批准，那就再也不会有任何新的谈判了。如果西德重新武装起来，那末在欧洲还有什么问题可谈呢？批准巴黎协定就会使关于恢复德国统一的谈判成为毫无意义，并且会消除就这一问题达成协议的可能。”
    波立特指出，在反对批准巴黎协定的斗争中，英国人民有德国、法国以及其他国家的工人阶级作为他们重要的同盟军，这些国家的工人阶级同样担心着西德的重新军国主义化给和平造成的威胁。
    波立特在谈到下院讨论巴黎协定时指出，赞成这一协定的只有百分之四十的议员。在英国，反对武装西德的情绪是这样的激烈，以至于大多数工党议员都在表决时弃权。
