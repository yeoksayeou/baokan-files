Sufficient Material Supply at Jiangxi Province's Riverside and Lakeside Embankment Restoration Sites

Large-scale embankment restoration and breach sealing projects in riverside and lakeside areas of Jiangxi Province have successively commenced. To ensure the smooth progress of these projects, supply departments in various riverside and lakeside counties have made ample preparations to ensure that food, vegetables, and other necessities are supplied wherever the embankment is being repaired. The Nanchang Special District Grain Bureau has transferred 1.85 million jin of rice and 3 million jin of paddy rice from Gao'an, Fengxin, and other counties to embankment restoration and breach sealing sites in Nanchang, Xinjian, and Jinxian counties. The Jiujiang Special District Grain Bureau has supplied 1.3 million jin of grain from Xingzi, Hukou, and other counties to the embankment repair site in Jiujiang County. The Shangrao Special District Grain Bureau has also ensured the food needs of the laborers at the embankment restoration and breach sealing sites. To further facilitate the purchase of grain by laborers, Xinjian, Nanchang, Jinxian and other counties have also set up seventeen supply stations at the construction sites, and rice milling machines have been installed in key embankment construction sites in Yugan and Nanchang. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Jinxian, Xinjian and other counties have prepared more than one million jin of firewood and a large amount of pickled vegetables for the laborers. Qiqu District in Pengze County is an island in the Yangtze River. In order to solve the difficulties of inconvenient transportation during storms, the supply and marketing cooperatives have established temporary warehouses at the construction sites, preparing a large amount of dried fish, mustard greens, green vegetables, oil, salt and other supplies to ensure that the laborers have sufficient non-staple food and vegetables. The Nanchang Prefectural Commissioner's Office Health Department has also organized more than thirty medical personnel to go to various embankments to provide medical services to the laborers. With such strong support from all parties, the laborers unanimously stated: We will definitely repair the embankments to ensure that there will be no flooding or inundation at this year's flood level.

    江西省沿江滨湖复堤工地物资供应充足
    江西省沿江滨湖地区大规模的复堤堵口工程已先后开工。为了保证这一工程顺利进行，沿江滨湖各县供应部门进行了充分准备，保证堤防修到那里，粮食蔬菜等就供应到那里。南昌专区粮食局已从高安、奉新等县调出一百八十五万斤大米，三百万斤稻谷，运到南昌、新建、进贤等县复堤堵口工地。九江专区粮食局从星子、湖口等县调到九江县修堤工地上的粮食，已达一百三十万斤。上饶专区粮食局也保证了复堤堵口工地上民工食粮的需要。为了进一步便利民工购粮，新建、南昌、进贤等县还在工地上设立了十七个供应站，馀干、南昌在重点圩堤工地上安装了碾米机。进贤、新建等县供销合作社为民工准备了一百多万斤柴火和大批咸菜，彭泽县七区是长江中的洲地，为了解决暴风骤雨期间交通不便的困难，供销社在工地建立临时仓库多处，准备大批干鱼、芥菜、青菜、油、盐等货源，保证民工有充分副食品和蔬菜。南昌专署卫生科还组织三十多名医务人员，分赴各堤为民工进行医疗工作。各地民工在这样大力支援下，一致表示：一定把堤防修好，保证在今年的洪水位不渍不漫。
