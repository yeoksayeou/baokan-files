Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 23rd: The West Bengal Provincial Peace Conference of India was held in Calcutta on the 18th and 19th. The conference unanimously passed a resolution calling for an end to foreign interference in Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory, the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, the expansion of peace zones, and the establishment of Asian solidarity based on the Five Principles put forward in the joint statement of Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru. The resolution also called for the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the dismantling of all foreign war bases from Asian soil. The conference expressed its heartfelt support for the resolutions of the World Peace Council meeting in Stockholm.
　　More than 500 representatives and prominent figures invited to the conference attended the conference. Mrs. Jessie Street, a well-known Australian peace fighter, Ms. Lucy Woodcock, and General Sok, Vice Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, spoke at the meeting.
　　At the conclusion of the conference, a mass rally with a large number of people was held at Wellington Square in Calcutta. Speakers at the meeting emphasized the need to launch a strong peace movement to establish collective security in Asia and expand the peace zone based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. They also sharply criticized the practice of violating the UN Charter by establishing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and other war blocs to realize imperialist conspiracies.

"Akahata" Exposes the Conspiracy of the United States to Establish Aggressive Blocs
　　Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Tokyo News: The Japanese Communist Party's central organ "Akahata" published an editorial on the 13th entitled "America's War Provocation," denouncing the "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
　　The editorial pointed out that the purpose of concluding the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is extremely obvious, which is to legalize the U.S. military occupation of Taiwan, expand aggression against China with Taiwan as a base, and prepare for a new war.
　　The editorial said that, as pointed out by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai in his statement on the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," this treaty is not only "a serious war provocation against the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people," but also a serious provocation to safeguarding peace and security in Asia and the world.
　　The editorial said that this treaty and the "Japan-China Peace Treaty" concluded by the Yoshida government with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, as well as the Southeast Asia Treaty concluded in Manila in September this year, all have the same conspiracy, that is, the war forces headed by U.S. imperialism want to establish specific military blocs in Asia in order to attack Asian democratic countries and suppress the national liberation movements and peace movements of the Asian people.

New Zealand "Peace" Monthly Condemns U.S. Aggressive Actions Against China
　　Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Wellington News: The New Zealand Peace Council's organ, the monthly magazine "Peace," published an article in its latest issue denouncing U.S. aggressive actions against China. The article said that recent news shows that the United States is using every possible means to assist Chiang Kai-shek and carry out war activities against China. The article said that unless the U.S. armed forces withdraw from Taiwan, the United Nations discusses the accusation of aggression against China, and the People's Republic of China obtains its seat in the United Nations, the situation will continue to threaten peace in the Pacific. The commentary pointed out that the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a just struggle to defend world peace.
　　This issue of "Peace" monthly also published another article condemning U.S. aggressive actions against China. The article pointed out that the "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the United States and Chiang Kai-shek is a war provocation against China. The article said that in the past few years, under the protection and assistance of the U.S. Navy and Air Force, the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Taiwan have been violating international law, harassing free trade in the Taiwan Strait, and engaging in open piracy. The article went on to say that now, Chiang Kai-shek's troops are stepping up attacks on the Chinese coast, which threatens peace in the Pacific. The article said that in order to understand the patience of the Chinese people, we should imagine how we would feel if an irreconcilable aggressive enemy were gathering troops on Kapiti Island and attacking the Wellington coast. The article said that New Zealanders never want to be dragged into a war launched by Chiang Kai-shek or his American supporters. The article advocates recognizing the People's Republic of China and enabling it to obtain its seat in the United Nations.

    中国人民解放台湾是保卫和平的正义斗争
    印度西孟加拉省和平大会要求制止美国干涉
    【新华社新德里二十三日电】印度西孟加拉省和平大会十八日和十九日在加尔各答举行。大会一致通过决议，要求制止外国对中国领土的不可分割的部分台湾的干涉，恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位扩大和平地区，并且建立以周恩来总理和尼赫鲁总理的联合声明中提出的五项原则为基础的亚洲团结。决议还要求从亚洲土地上撤退一切外国部队，撤除一切外国战争基地。大会表示衷心拥护世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议的决议。
    出席大会的有五百多位代表和应邀参加大会的著名人士。澳大利亚著名和平战士杰西·斯崔特夫人、刘西·伍德库克女士以及全印和平理事会副主席索克少将等在会上发了言。
    大会结束时，在加尔各答的惠灵顿广场举行了一次人数众多的群众大会。在会上发言的人都强调有必要开展强大的和平运动，以根据和平共处的五项原则，在亚洲建立集体安全并扩大和平地区。他们还尖锐地指责了违反联合国宪章通过建立东南亚条约组织和其他战争集团来实现帝国主义阴谋的做法。
    “赤旗报”揭露美国建立侵略集团的阴谋
   【新华社二十三日讯】东京消息：日本共产党中央机关报“赤旗报”十三日发表题为“美国的战争挑衅”的社论，斥责美国政府和蒋介石卖国集团签订的“共同防御条约”。
    社论指出，缔结美蒋“共同防御条约”的目的是极为明显的，这就是要使美国军事占领台湾合法化，以台湾为基地扩大对中国的侵略，并为进行新的战争作准备。
    社论说，正如周恩来外交部长在关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明中所指出的，这个条约不仅是 “对于中华人民共和国和中国人民的一个严重的战争挑衅”，而且也是对保障亚洲和世界的和平和安全的一个严重的挑衅。
    社论说，这个条约和吉田政府同蒋介石卖国集团所缔结的“日华和约”、以及今年九月在马尼拉缔结的东南亚条约都具有同一的阴谋，这就是以美帝国主义为首的战争势力要在亚洲建立特定的军事集团，以便进攻亚洲民主国家和镇压亚洲人民的民族解放运动和和平运动。
    新西兰“和平”月刊斥美国对中国的侵略行动
    【新华社二十三日讯】惠灵顿消息：新西兰和平理事会的机关刊物“和平”月刊在最近一期上发表了一篇文章，斥责美国对中国的侵略行动。文章说，近来的消息表明，美国正在用一切可能的办法援助蒋介石，对中国进行战争活动。文章说，除非美国武装部队退出台湾，联合国讨论对中国的侵略的控诉，让中华人民共和国取得在联合国中的席位，局势将继续威胁着太平洋的和平。评论指出，中国人民解放台湾的斗争，是保卫世界和平的正义斗争。
    这一期“和平”月刊还发表了另一篇谴责美国对中国的侵略行动的文章。文章指出，美国和蒋介石签订的“共同防御条约”是对中国的战争挑衅。文章说，在过去几年中，在台湾的蒋介石军队在美国海空军的保护和援助下，一直在违反国际公法，骚扰台湾海峡的自由贸易，进行公开的海盗活动。文章接着说，现在，蒋介石军队正在加紧进行对中国海岸的攻击，这种行动威胁着太平洋的和平。文章说，为了了解中国人的耐心，我们应该设想一下，如果一个不共戴天的侵略敌人正在卡毕蒂岛上集结军队并且攻击惠灵顿海岸的话，我们会有什么感想。文章说，新西兰人决不希望被拖入蒋介石或他的美国支持者所发动的战争中去。文章主张承认中华人民共和国并且使它取得在联合国中的席位。
