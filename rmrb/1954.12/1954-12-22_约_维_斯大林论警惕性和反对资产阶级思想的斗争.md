    J.V. Stalin on Vigilance and the Struggle Against Bourgeois Ideology
    Soviet Master of History A. Weibo
    The leader and mentor of the international proletariat, V.I. Lenin, made tremendous contributions to the development of Marxist theory and to the doctrine of the Communist Party's strategy and tactics in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution. After the death of V.I. Lenin, his loyal student and close comrade J.V. Stalin led the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and developed Marxism-Leninism under the conditions of socialist society construction. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people achieved a victory of worldwide historical significance—the construction of socialism and the gradual transition from socialism to communism.
    One of the most important historical lessons of the proletariat's class struggle against the bourgeoisie and landlords is that the working class and its allies should demonstrate a high degree of revolutionary vigilance in all stages of struggle and constructive labor. This is what V.I. Lenin taught us. J.V. Stalin also attached great importance to this most important issue in his writings.
    In Russia, during the preparation period for the proletarian revolution, the class enemies not only gave the proletariat open suppression but also carried out a cruel and hidden struggle against it. The police dispatched their secret agents and spies to infiltrate workers' organizations in order to track down revolutionary activists, arrest fighters for the liberation of the working class, secretly murder them, and sabotage the proletariat's organizations. At the same time, the bourgeoisie attempted to disarm the working class ideologically. The bourgeoisie carried out open propaganda aimed at opposing Marxism, attempting to "overthrow" Marxist theory, thereby hindering the raising of the revolutionary consciousness of the working masses. Accompanying the open attacks on proletarian ideology, the bourgeoisie also adopted disguised forms of ideological struggle. The bourgeoisie's agents, posing as "friends" of the working class, promoted anti-Marxist theories, attempting to emasculate the revolutionary essence of Marxism and replace proletarian ideology with bourgeois or petty-bourgeois ideology.
    In pre-revolutionary Russia, the "Legal Marxists," "Economists," "Social Revolutionaries," Mensheviks, and Anarchists were such bourgeois agents. In Western Europe, various revisionists and opportunists were such bourgeois agents. The struggle against such hidden enemies of the working class was more complex than the struggle against openly active enemies. Hidden class enemies used deception and insidious means to strike the working class from behind. Here, the revolutionary vigilance of the proletarian party and the entire working class played an extremely great role.
    A high degree of revolutionary vigilance can expose the activities of the hidden enemy's spies, provocateurs, and traitors to the workers' movement, promptly recognize their conspiracies, and give the enemy's every blow a doubled response, making them unable to accomplish anything.
    V.I. Lenin and J.V. Stalin taught that the higher the level of revolutionary consciousness of the working class, the more profoundly they grasp the basic principles of Marxism, the more clearly the proletariat can see the entire reactionary nature of bourgeois ideology, the more correctly it can expose the ideological tricks of the class enemies, and give them a counterattack.
    After the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, when the entire state power was transferred to the hands of workers and peasants, the struggle with the overthrown but not yet eliminated exploiting classes took on new forms. These new forms were: using the means of the dictatorship of the proletariat to suppress the bourgeoisie, consolidating the alliance of the working class with the laboring peasant masses, cultivating new labor discipline among the laborers, fighting to defend socialist property, and so on.
    Based on an analysis of the domestic situation in the Soviet Union, J.V. Stalin pointed out that under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, class enemies could not openly oppose the laborers; they adopted the following types of hidden struggle methods, such as sabotage and carrying out covert harm, organizing conspiracies, using various bourgeois ideological remnants in people's minds, etc. He also taught that the laborers of the Soviet state should not forget for a minute the existence of capitalist encirclement, and should not forget that the governments of various imperialist countries were sending spies and saboteurs to the Soviet Union, attempting to recruit agents for themselves among the residents of our country, and should first pay attention to those who came from the overthrown ruling classes and those who were unaware, politically backward elements among the working people.
    In 1928, a huge sabotage organization of bourgeois experts active in the Shakhty district of the Donbas was uncovered in the Soviet Union. J.V. Stalin pointed out that the Shakhty saboteurs were able to carry out their activities because the party and economic leaders lacked vigilance, were unfamiliar with their business, and were unfamiliar with the characteristics of the production process. It was precisely because of this that the enemies of the Soviet people were able to deceive the party and Soviet personnel, thereby causing significant losses to our national economy.
    The task that J.V. Stalin put forward to the party and economic personnel was to raise revolutionary vigilance, insist on mastering the characteristics of the production process, become experts in production technology, so that the saboteurs among the former bourgeois experts could no longer deceive the Soviet personnel and harm the socialist national economy.
    The question of raising the vigilance of the Communist Party members and all laborers of the Soviet state was also raised particularly sharply when the various anti-party groups were ideologically crushed, lost all foothold in the working class, no longer became a political faction, but degenerated into an intelligence branch of imperialism, degenerated into spies, saboteurs, murderers, and destroyers, and degenerated into traitors to the motherland.
    In December 1934, a member of the Trotsky-Zinoviev terrorist gang viciously assassinated Sergei M. Kirov, an outstanding activist of the Communist Party and the Soviet state.
    The Central Committee of the Party, in its letter to all levels of the Party organization announcing the vicious assassination of Sergei M. Kirov, instructed: "It must be remembered that the more desperate the enemy's situation, the more willing they are to adopt 'extreme measures' as the only and final struggle against the Soviet regime. This should be remembered and a vigilant spirit should be maintained."
    The task that the Central Committee of the Communist Party put forward to all party members was to study the history of the Party, because this is the most important tool necessary to fully ensure the revolutionary vigilance of party members.
    In his work "On the shortcomings of Party work and methods of eliminating Trotskyite double-dealers and other double-dealers" (1937), J.V. Stalin made a profound analysis of the domestic situation and pointed out the methods of struggling against the enemies of the people. In this work, J.V. Stalin explained that the main shortcomings in the work of the party organizations at that time were the political carelessness, complacency, and insufficient vigilance they exhibited. The root cause lies in the fact that many party workers have an insufficient understanding of the danger of capitalist encirclement and the activities of spies and saboteurs in imperialist countries. They were fascinated by the economic movement and overestimated the achievements that had been obtained. As a result, they showed a mood of self-satisfaction and complacency, political blindness, weakened self-criticism, and neglected intra-party democracy.
    J.V. Stalin pointed out the necessity of strengthening the political and organizational work of the Party to consolidate the Party and Soviet organs. J.V. Stalin demanded that Party members' study of the history of the Party and the Communist Party's struggle strategy against anti-Party groups, as well as the study of those methods that enabled the Party to defeat the enemy in the past, be raised to the due level. He emphasized that without studying Marxist-Leninist theory, without studying the theory of opposition to the bourgeoisie and the irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois ideological remnants in people's minds, the class enemies cannot be completely defeated. J.V. Stalin instructed that the following tasks can be directly put forward from this: namely, the need to transform the petty bourgeoisie, to constantly carry out ideological work among the laboring people, and to tirelessly and irreconcilably carry out the struggle against the remnants of the past. The higher the level of consciousness of the laboring people, the higher their vigilance will be, and the more smoothly they will be able to carry out the struggle against the enemies of socialism inside and outside.
    J.V. Stalin taught that comprehensively strengthening criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below, is of great significance for raising revolutionary vigilance. He said that if millions of laboring masses vigilantly watched everything that happened in our lives, if they bravely exposed the shortcomings in the work of the Party, state, economic, and social organizations, then it would be possible to expose the enemy's activities, expose their masks, and make them powerless and eliminate them. He also instructed that in order to raise vigilance, it is necessary to do everything possible to consolidate intra-party democracy, consolidate party discipline, consolidate the ties between party organizations and the masses, and to teach the masses and learn from the masses.
    Following the instructions of the Party Central Committee headed by J.V. Stalin, the Soviet state organs eliminated the enemy's lairs. This enabled the Soviet system to be further consolidated, and enabled the economic and cultural construction of the Soviet state to achieve new achievements.
    During the Great Patriotic War, J.V. Stalin called on the laboring people to raise their vigilance, and taught that this was one of the most important conditions for ensuring victory over the enemy. The Soviet people, whether on the front lines or in the rear, showed tireless vigilance, exposed spies, saboteurs, and traitors, and made them powerless.
    After the Soviet people victoriously ended the war against fascist Germany, they engaged in peaceful and constructive labor. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people are completing the great task of communist construction, and they are vigilantly watching the conspiracies of the enemies of peace and democracy. They will always remember these words of J.V. Stalin: if the laboring people show sufficient revolutionary vigilance, then they will be able to strike the enemies of the present as they did the enemies of the past.

    约·维·斯大林论警惕性和反对资产阶级思想的斗争
    苏联历史学硕士  阿·魏博
    国际无产阶级的领袖和导师弗·伊·列宁，对马克思主义理论的发展，对关于共产党在帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代的战略和策略的学说，作了巨大的贡献。在弗·伊·列宁逝世以后，他的忠实学生和亲密战友约·维·斯大林领导了苏联共产党中央委员会，在社会主义社会建设条件下发展了马克思列宁主义。苏联人民在共产党的领导下，取得了全世界历史意义的胜利——建成了社会主义，并开始从社会主义逐步向共产主义过渡。
    工人阶级和它的同盟者在从事斗争和建设性劳动的所有各个阶段都应当表现出高度的革命警惕性，这是无产阶级反对资产阶级和地主的阶级斗争的最重要的历史教训之一。弗·伊·列宁曾这样教导我们。约·维·斯大林在他的著作中也是很重视这个最重要的问题的。
    在俄国，在无产阶级革命的准备时期，阶级敌人不仅给无产阶级以公开的镇压，并且对它进行了残酷的隐蔽的斗争。警察派遣他们的暗探和奸细潜入工人组织，以便跟踪革命积极分子，逮捕争取工人阶级解放的斗士，暗地里谋害他们，破坏无产阶级的组织。同时，资产阶级企图从思想上解除工人阶级的武装。资产阶级进行了旨在反对马克思主义的公开宣传，力图“推翻”马克思主义理论，从而阻碍劳动群众的革命觉悟的提高。伴随着对无产阶级思想的公开的抨击，资产阶级还采取了伪装的思想斗争的方式。资产阶级的代理人冒充工人阶级的“朋友”，宣扬反马克思主义的理论，企图阉割马克思主义的革命实质，以资产阶级或小资产阶级思想代替无产阶级思想。
    在革命前的俄国，“合法马克思主义者”、“经济派分子”、“社会革命党人”、孟什维克、无政府主义者，就是这样的资产阶级代理人。在西欧，各种各样的修正主义分子和机会主义分子，都是这样的资产阶级代理人。反对这样一些隐蔽的工人阶级的敌人的斗争，是比反对公开活动的敌人的斗争更加复杂的。隐蔽的阶级敌人用欺骗、阴险的手段，从背后打击工人阶级。在这里，无产阶级政党和全体工人阶级的革命警惕性起着极其伟大的作用。
    高度的革命警惕性，能够揭穿暗藏的敌人的奸细、挑拨者、工人运动的叛徒的活动，及时识破他们的阴谋，给敌人的每次打击以双倍的回击，使他们不能有所作为。
    弗·伊·列宁和约·维·斯大林教导说，工人阶级的革命觉悟水平愈高，他们掌握马克思主义的基本原理愈是深刻，无产阶级就愈能明显地看出资产阶级思想的全部反动性，它就愈能正确地揭穿阶级敌人的思想诡计，并给以回击。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命在俄国取得胜利以后，国家的整个政权转入工人和农民的手中，这时，同被推翻的、但还没有消灭的剥削阶级的斗争，采取了新的形式。这些新的形式是：用无产阶级专政的手段镇压资产阶级，巩固工人阶级同劳动农民群众的联盟，在劳动者之间培育新的劳动纪律，为保卫社会主义财产而斗争以及其他等等。
    根据对苏联国内情况的分析，约·维·斯大林指出，在无产阶级专政的条件下，阶级敌人不能公开反对劳动者，他们采取下列这类隐秘的斗争方式，如怠工和进行暗害，组织阴谋，利用人们意识中的各种资产阶级思想残余等。他还教导说，苏维埃国家的劳动者一分钟都不应当忘记资本主义包围的存在，不应当忘记各帝国主义国家的政府在向苏联派遣间谍和破坏分子，企图在我国居民中为自己招募代理人，并首先注意那些从被推翻的统治阶级中出身的人和劳动人民中那些不觉悟的、政治上落后的分子。
    一九二八年在苏联破获了一个在顿巴斯的沙赫特区活动的资产阶级专家的巨大的破坏组织。约·维·斯大林指出，沙赫特破坏分子们所以能展开活动，是因为党的和经济的领导人缺乏警惕性，不熟悉自己的业务，不熟悉生产过程的特点。正是由于这点才使苏维埃人民的敌人得以欺骗党的和苏维埃的工作人员，从而使我国的国民经济遭到重大的损失。
    约·维·斯大林向党的和经济的工作人员提出的任务是，提高革命的警惕性，坚持掌握生产过程的特点，成为生产技术的内行人，以便使以前的资产阶级专家中的破坏分子不能再欺骗苏维埃的工作人员并加害于社会主义的国民经济。
    当各个反党集团在思想上被粉碎，在工人阶级中失掉一切立足点，不再成为一种政治派别，而蜕化为帝国主义的谍报分支机关，蜕化为间谍、暗害分子、凶手和破坏分子，蜕化为祖国的叛徒的时候，提高苏维埃国家的共产党员和全体劳动者的警惕性的问题，也特别尖锐地提了出来。
    一九三四年十二月托洛茨基—季诺维也夫的恐怖匪帮中的一员，恶毒地刺杀了共产党和苏维埃国家的杰出活动家谢·米·基洛夫。
    党中央委员会在其为谢·米·基洛夫的被恶毒刺杀告全党各级组织的信上指示说：“必须记着，敌人处境愈是绝望，他们也就愈加乐于采取‘极端手段’，作为他们同苏维埃政权斗争的唯一最后挣扎手段。应该记着这一点，并保持着警觉精神。” 
    共产党中央委员会向各个党员提出的任务是，研究党史，因为这是充分保证党员的革命警惕性所必需的最重要的工具。
    约·维·斯大林在其著作“论党工作的缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法”（一九三七年）中，对国内的情况作了深刻的分析，并指出了同人民敌人斗争的方法。约·维·斯大林在这部著作中说明了，当时党组织工作中的主要缺点，就是它们所表现出来的政治上的疏忽大意、高枕无忧和警惕性不足。其根源就在于，许多党的工作人员对资本主义的包围、对帝国主义国家的间谍和破坏分子的活动的危险性认识不足。他们醉心于经济运动，过高地估计了已获得的成绩。结果，他们表现出了自安自慰的情绪、政治上的盲目、削弱了自我批评和忽视党内民主。
    约·维·斯大林指出了以加强党的政治工作和组织工作来巩固党和苏维埃机关的必要性。约·维·斯大林要求把党员研究党史和共产党反对反党集团的斗争策略，以及研究过去使党能够战胜敌人的那些方法，提到应有的高度。他强调说，不研究马克思列宁主义理论，不研究反对资产阶级的理论和反对人们意识中的资产阶级思想残余的不可调和的斗争，就不能完全战胜阶级敌人。约·维·斯大林指示说，由此可以直接提出下列任务：即改造小资产阶级，在劳动人民之间经常进行思想工作，以及不倦地和不调和地进行反对过去残余的斗争的必要性。劳动人民的觉悟程度越高，他们的警惕性就会越高，他们就能够更顺利地进行反对内外的社会主义的敌人的斗争。
    约·维·斯大林教导说，全面加强批评和自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评，对于提高革命的警惕性具有重大的意义。他说道，如果数百万劳动大众警觉地注视着我们生活中所发生的一切，如果他们勇敢地揭露党、国家、经济和社会的各组织的工作中的缺点，那就能够揭露敌人的活动，揭穿他们的假面具，就能使他们无能为害和把他们消灭。他还指示说，为了提高警惕性，就必须尽力巩固党内民主，巩固党的纪律，巩固党组织和群众的联系，要教导群众并向群众学习。
    苏维埃国家机关遵循着以约·维·斯大林为首的党中央委员会的指示，消灭了敌人的巢穴。这使苏维埃制度获得了进一步的巩固，使苏维埃国家的经济和文化建设获得了新的成就。
    在伟大卫国战争时期，约·维·斯大林号召劳动人民提高警惕性，并教导说，这是保证战胜敌人的最重要条件之一。苏联人民在前线或后方都表现出了不倦的警惕性，揭发了间谍、破坏分子和叛徒，并使他们无能为害。
    苏联人民在胜利地结束了反法西斯德国的战争后就从事了和平建设性的劳动。苏联人在共产党的领导下完成着共产主义建设的伟大任务，他们警惕地注视着和平和民主的敌人的阴谋。他们永远记住约·维·斯大林的这些话：如果劳动人民表现出足够的革命警惕性，那么，他们也就能像过去打击敌人那样来打击现在的敌人。
