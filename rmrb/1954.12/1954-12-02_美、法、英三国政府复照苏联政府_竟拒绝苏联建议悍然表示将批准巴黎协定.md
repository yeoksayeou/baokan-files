Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 30th (TASS): On November 29th, the United States, French, and British embassies in Moscow mailed their respective governments' replies to the Soviet government's notes of October 23rd and November 13th, 1954, to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

    The United States, French, and British governments, in their identical notes, stated their determination to "bring the Paris Agreements into effect as quickly as possible."

    The United States government, along with the French and British governments, expressed the hope that "disputed issues could be resolved through consultation in a spirit of mutual respect for the fundamental interests of all participating countries." However, they simultaneously asserted that, in their view, the necessary basis for "successfully holding a conference on Germany or Austria, and other aspects of European security" did not currently exist.

    The replies concluded by stating that the aforementioned three governments believed a four-power foreign ministers conference should be held only after such a basis existed, namely "after the practical possibility of resolving issues exists and after the countries concerned have ratified the Paris Agreements."

    Regarding a European conference to discuss the establishment of a collective security system, the three governments stated in their notes that they believed a "broader conference, including European countries and other relevant countries," could be held. However, they simultaneously introduced reservations, implying that such a conference could only be held after a four-power foreign ministers conference, and that this conference must be "beneficial."

    美、法、英三国政府复照苏联政府
    竟拒绝苏联建议悍然表示将批准巴黎协定
   【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一月三十日电：十一月二十九日，美国、法国和英国驻莫斯科大使馆把它们本国政府答复苏联政府一九五四年十月二十三日和十一月十三日照会的复照邮寄给苏联外交部。
    美国、法国和英国政府在它们内容相同的照会中表示，它们决心要“尽可能快地使巴黎协定生效”。
    美国政府以及法国和英国政府表示，希望“本着互相尊重所有参与国根本利益的精神，通过协商来解决纠纷问题”。但是它们同时却又认为：照它们的看法，目前似乎还不具备“就德国或是奥地利，以及欧洲安全其他方面问题顺利地举行会议的必要基础”。
    复照中最后表明，上述三国政府认为，要在有了这样的基础之后，即“刚才所说的，在有了解决问题的实际可能，并且在有关国家批准巴黎协定之后”，才能举行四国外长会议。
    至于对讨论建立集体安全体系的欧洲会议，三国政府在它们的照会中说，他们认为，可以举行
  “包括欧洲国家和其他有关国家在内的更广泛的会议”。但是，它们同时又提出了保留条件，意思是说，只有在四国外长会议举行之后，并且这个会议必须“是有益的”，才能举行这样的会议。
