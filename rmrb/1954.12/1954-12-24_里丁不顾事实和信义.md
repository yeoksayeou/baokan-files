British Deputy Foreign Minister Reading, in answering questions in the British House of Lords on the 20th regarding the British government's attitude toward the Taiwan issue, actually said that "there does not exist" any international document stipulating the status of Taiwan. He also said: "We do not consider it (Taiwan) to constitute a part of the People's Republic of China." This is the second British Deputy Foreign Minister in nine days to join the chorus led by the United States. A little over a week ago, another British Deputy Foreign Minister, Nutting, in New York, advocated for Britain's participation in the war of aggression against China launched by the United States.

What could be more disregardful of facts and betrayal of international good faith than Reading's statement? As a Deputy Foreign Minister, Reading is certainly well aware that there exists the Cairo Declaration, a trilateral declaration by China, Britain, and the United States, which stipulates that "the territories Japan has stolen from China," including Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, should be returned to China after being liberated from Japanese occupation. This declaration's stipulation regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan was reaffirmed in another international document signed by the British government—the Potsdam Proclamation. It was precisely based on these two international documents that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, on October 25, 1945, were liberated from Japanese occupation through Chinese surrender and returned to the embrace of the motherland. This is a clear and obvious fact. Reading's denial of the existence of international documents regarding the status of Taiwan, does he intend to tear up these solemn international agreements? Does he intend to betray international good faith? Reading is also certainly well aware that in January 1950, the British government, in its note to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, stated that the British government recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the legal government of China and is willing to establish diplomatic relations with it "on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect of territory and sovereignty." No British official in charge has been heard to express regret about this.

Since Taiwan is Chinese territory and since the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, Taiwan is naturally a part of the People's Republic of China. This is the clearest fact. Now Reading has concocted a set of fallacies such as "Taiwan's status is a somewhat difficult status in international law" and "its exact status is a highly technical issue" to confuse public opinion. This has no other explanation except to prove that he is painstakingly trying to please Washington.

Reading was originally asked to come out to eliminate the legitimate dissatisfaction of the British people caused by Nutting's flattery of Washington, because Nutting's remarks on Britain's policy toward Taiwan contained the danger of dragging Britain into a war of aggression against the Chinese people. However, Reading has proven that he prefers to compete with Nutting for favor.

Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government with the right to administer Taiwan. This ironclad fact cannot be changed by any kind of nonsense. However, it cannot be considered normal for one Deputy Foreign Minister after another to make such statements that disregard facts and good faith for any country's government.

    里丁不顾事实和信义
    新华社评论员  江南
    英国外交副大臣里丁二十日在英国上议院回答关于英国政府对台湾问题的态度的质问时，竟说“并不存在”规定台湾的地位的国际文件。他还说：“我们并不认为它（台湾）构成中华人民共和国的一部分。”这是九天中间第二个英国的外交副大臣加入美国指挥的合唱队。一个多星期以前，另外一个英国外交副大臣纳丁在纽约鼓吹英国参加美国发动的侵略中国的战争。
    还有什么更比里丁这个声明更加不顾事实和背弃国际信义的么？身为外交副大臣，里丁当然十分清楚，有一个有英国政府参加的中、英、美三国开罗宣言，这个宣言规定“日本所窃取于中国之领土”，包括台湾和澎湖在解脱日本的占领之后应该归还中国。这个宣言关于台湾主权问题的规定在英国政府参加签订的另一项国际文件——波茨坦公告中又得到了确认。正是根据这两个国际文件，台湾和澎湖在一九四五年十月二十五日经过中国受降而脱离日本占领，重归祖国版图。这是明明白白的事实。里丁否认有关于台湾地位的国际文件，是不是想撕毁这些庄严的国际协议，是不是想背弃国际信义呢？里丁当然也十分清楚，一九五○年一月，英国政府在它给中华人民共和国中央人民政府的照会中，曾表示英国政府承认中华人民共和国政府是中国的合法的政府，愿意和它“在平等、互利和互相尊重领土与主权的基础上建立外交关系”。人们还没有听见过任何一个英国的负责官员对此表示后悔。
    既然台湾是中国的领土，既然中华人民共和国是中国唯一合法的政府，台湾当然是中华人民共和国的一部分。这是最清楚不过的事实。现在里丁竟然编造了一套什么“台湾的地位是一个在国际法上有些困难的地位”、“它的确切地位是一个高度技术性的问题”的谬论来混淆视听，这除了证明他煞费苦心地要讨好华盛顿以外，没有任何其他解释。
    里丁原来是被要求出来消除英国人民由于纳丁的对华盛顿的献媚而产生的正当的不满的，因为纳丁关于英国对台湾问题的政策谈话包含着把英国卷入到一场对中国人民的侵略战争中去的危险。但是，里丁却证明了他自己宁愿与纳丁争宠。
    台湾是中国领土的一部分，中华人民共和国政府是中国有权管辖台湾的唯一合法的政府，这个铁定的事实，不是任何胡言乱语所能改变得了的。但是一个外交副大臣接着一个外交副大臣发表这种不顾事实和信义的声明，对任何一个国家的政府来说都不能被认为是正常的事。
