Comrades and friends,
Today is the tenth anniversary of the Albanian people's liberation from fascist enslavement. We, the government delegation of the People's Republic of China, entrusted by the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, have come to your beautiful capital, Tirana, to celebrate this glorious festival with you. On behalf of the Chinese people, the Chinese government, and Chairman Mao Zedong himself, we extend warm congratulations and fraternal greetings to the heroic Albanian people.
In the past, the Albanian people had long been subjected to foreign rule and enslavement, but they never ceased their heroic struggle for freedom and independence. During the occupation by the Italian and German fascist bandits, Albanian patriots devoted themselves to the just struggle for national liberation, creating countless moving deeds. During World War II, the heroic Albanian people put up a staunch resistance against the fascist aggressors. Their victorious struggle won the sympathy and praise of the people of the world and greatly encouraged the Chinese people who were then resisting the Japanese imperialist aggression.
Ten years ago today—November 29, 1944—under the victorious conditions of the powerful Soviet Red Army defeating the main military forces of Hitler's Germany and its vassal states, the Albanian people finally liberated all the territory of their motherland and gained freedom and independence forever. Since then, the Albanian people have become masters of the country, established a people's democratic regime, implemented fundamental social and economic reforms, completely freed themselves from the oppression of imperialism and feudalism, and embarked on an infinitely bright socialist road for their motherland.
Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, the People's Republic of Albania has made great achievements in the political, economic, and cultural fields. The Albanian people are now building modern industry and transportation, which they have never had in their history. In agriculture, due to the development of agricultural collectivization and mechanization, the output of agricultural products has been rapidly increased.
With the rapid development of economic construction, the people's culture is also growing rapidly. Illiteracy is being eliminated throughout the country, new worker-peasant intellectuals are growing up, and the material and cultural life of the people has been significantly improved. All these facts fully demonstrate the superiority of the people's democratic system, which makes the alliance of the Albanian working class and laboring peasants increasingly consolidated.
We know that these brilliant achievements of the Albanian people were won in a fierce struggle against enemies at home and abroad. All the conspiracies of the imperialists and their lackeys have been mercilessly struck down by the strong Albanian people and declared bankrupt. The People's Republic of Albania has always stood firmly at the forefront of defending the cause of peace.
The Albanian people stand together with the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries and have made their own contributions to the struggle to defend world peace and ease international tensions. The continuous consolidation and development of the friendship between the great Soviet people—our common ally—and the Albanian people is a guarantee for the Albanian people to build their beautiful life. Our two peoples cherish the fraternal friendship with our common and closest friend, the great Soviet people, as we cherish the apple of our eye.
The Chinese people pay great attention to the victories and achievements won by the Albanian people in economic construction and in the struggle to defend the security of their motherland. Our people also regard these victories and achievements as their own. When Chairman Mao Zedong accepted the credentials presented by Nesti Nase, the first ambassador of the People's Republic of Albania to China, he said: "In the ten years since the liberation of the Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, they have shattered all the sabotage plots of enemies at home and abroad, built their beautiful life with full confidence, and achieved brilliant achievements. The Albanian people's patriotism and unparalleled labor enthusiasm shown in the socialist construction and in the struggle to defend the independence and security of their motherland make the Chinese people admire them." The liberation of the Albanian people and the victory of the Chinese revolution have created a new foundation for the friendship between our two peoples. For five years, the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples has been continuously consolidated and developed.
This year, Albania and China have exchanged diplomatic envoys. The Albanian government delegation headed by Comrade Shtuila came to Beijing to participate in our fifth anniversary National Day celebration, and signed the Sino-Albanian Cultural Cooperation Agreement and the Sino-Albanian Technical and Technical Science Cooperation Agreement. These gratifying events mark the further development and consolidation of the fraternal friendship between the Albanian and Chinese peoples, and mark the further strengthening of the close relations between our two peoples in the political, economic, and cultural fields.
Our two countries are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers geographically, but due to our close friendship and common goals, there is no distance between our two countries.
Dear comrades and friends! As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of Albania's liberation here, on behalf of the 600 million Chinese people, let me sincerely wish the Albanian people greater victories in the lofty cause of further consolidating the people's democratic regime, developing the national economy, improving the people's material and cultural living standards, building socialism, and safeguarding world peace!
Long live the People's Republic of Albania!
Long live the Albanian Labor Party!
Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples!
Long live the unity of the world's forces of peace and democracy headed by the Soviet Union!

    在阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年庆祝大会上
    李先念副总理的讲话亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    今天是阿尔巴尼亚人民从法西斯奴役下获得解放的十周年。我们，中华人民共和国政府代表团，受中华人民共和国政府和中国人民的委托，来到你们美丽的首都地拉那，和你们共同欢度这个光荣的节日。我们代表中国人民、中国政府和毛泽东主席本人，向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民致以热烈的祝贺和兄弟般的敬礼。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民在过去曾经长期地受着外国的统治和奴役，但是他们从来也没有停止过争取自由和独立的英勇斗争。在意、德法西斯匪帮的侵占时期，阿尔巴尼亚的爱国者献身于争取民族解放的正义斗争，创造了无数可歌可泣的事迹。第二次世界大战期间，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民对法西斯侵略者进行了坚强的抵抗。他们的胜利斗争得到了全世界人民的同情和赞扬，并给当时正在抵抗日本帝国主义侵略者的中国人民以很大鼓舞。
    十年前的今天——一九四四年十一月二十九日，在强大的苏联红军击溃希特勒德国及其附庸国主要军事力量的胜利条件下，阿尔巴尼亚人民最后地解放了祖国的全部国土，永远地获得了自由和独立。阿尔巴尼亚人民从此做了国家的主人，建立了人民民主政权，实行了根本的社会—经济改革，彻底地摆脱了帝国主义和封建主义的压迫，使自己的祖国走上了无限光明灿烂的社会主义的道路。
    十年来，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，在苏联和各人民民主国家的无私援助下，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国在政治、经济和文化各方面都获得了巨大的成就。现在，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在建设着自己历史上所没有的现代工业和运输业。在农业方面，由于农业合作化和机械化的发展，迅速地提高了农产品的产量。
    随着经济建设的迅速发展，人民的文化也在迅速增长，全国的文盲正在消除，新的工农知识分子正在成长，人民的物质与文化生活显著地提高了。所有这些事实，充分说明人民民主制度的优越性，它使阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟日益巩固。
    我们知道，阿尔巴尼亚人民的这些光辉的成就是在同国内外敌人进行残酷斗争中赢得的。帝国主义者及其仆从们的一切阴谋活动，都遭到坚强的阿尔巴尼亚人民的无情打击而宣告破产。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国却始终坚强地屹立在保卫和平事业的最前线。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和以苏联为首的各兄弟国家站在一起，在为保卫世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中，作出了自己的贡献。伟大的苏联人民——我们共同的盟邦——和阿尔巴尼亚人民之间友谊的不断巩固和发展，是阿尔巴尼亚人民建设自己美好生活的保证。我们两国人民都像爱护自己的眼珠一样，无限珍贵同我们共同的最亲密的朋友——伟大苏联人民之间的兄弟友谊。
    中国人民以极大的关怀注视着阿尔巴尼亚人民在经济建设上和在捍卫祖国安全的斗争中所赢得的胜利和成就。我国人民把这些胜利和成就，也看作是自己的胜利和成就。毛泽东主席在接受阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国首任驻华大使奈斯蒂·纳赛呈递国书时曾说：“阿尔巴尼亚人民解放后十年来，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，粉碎了国内外敌人的一切破坏阴谋，满怀信心地建设着自己的美好生活，并取得了光辉的成就。阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义建设和捍卫祖国的独立和安全的斗争中所表现的爱国主义精神和无比的劳动热情，使中国人民感到钦佩。”阿尔巴尼亚人民的解放和中国人民革命的胜利，为我们两国人民的友谊创造了新的基础。五年以来，中阿两国人民的友谊获得了不断的巩固和发展。
    今年，阿尔巴尼亚和中国互派了外交使节，以什图拉同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚政府代表团到北京参加了我国五周年国庆典礼，并签订了中阿文化合作协定、中阿技术和技术科学合作协定。这一些可喜的事件，标志着阿尔巴尼亚和中国两国人民的兄弟般的友谊的进一步发展和巩固，标志着我们两国人民在政治、经济和文化方面的密切关系的进一步加强。
    我们两国在地理上相距千山万水之遥，但是由于我们之间的亲密友谊和目标的一致，已使我们两国之间没有任何距离。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！当我们在这里庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十周年的时候，让我代表六亿中国人民，衷心地预祝阿尔巴尼亚人民在进一步巩固人民民主政权、发展国民经济、提高人民的物质和文化生活水平、建设社会主义和维护世界和平的崇高事业中，获得更大的胜利！
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！
    中阿两国人民的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量团结万岁！
