Xinhua News Agency, Bogor, 30th - The South Asian Five Prime Ministers Conference held in Bogor, Indonesia, concluded on the afternoon of the 29th after two days of discussions. The conference decided to invite twenty-five African and Asian countries, including the People's Republic of China, to participate in the Asian-African Conference scheduled for the last week of April 1955 in Indonesia.

The full text of the joint communiqué issued by the five prime ministers in Bogor on the 29th is as follows:

(1) The Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan met in Bogor on December 28th and 29th.

The main purpose of their meeting was to discuss the question of the Asian-African Conference raised at the Prime Ministers' first meeting held in Colombo last April.

(2) The Prime Ministers availed themselves of their present meeting to discuss briefly and generally various issues of common interest and concern to all of them.

(3) The Prime Ministers unanimously agreed that the Asian-African Conference should be jointly sponsored by them. They have also reached agreement on all issues arising from the Asian-African Conference.

(4) The purposes of the Asian-African Conference are:

	(A) To promote goodwill and cooperation among the nations of Asia and Africa, to explore and advance mutual and common interests, and to establish and promote friendly and good neighborly relations.

	(B) To consider social, economic, and cultural problems and relations of the countries represented.

	(C) To consider problems of special interest to Asian and African peoples, for example, problems affecting national sovereignty and of racialism and colonialism.

	(D) To view the position of Asia and Africa and their peoples in the world today and the contribution they can make to the promotion of world peace and cooperation.

(5) The Asian-African Conference is scheduled to be held in Indonesia in the last week of April 1955. The Indonesian government has agreed to make the necessary arrangements for this conference on behalf of the sponsoring countries. A secretariat for the conference representing the sponsoring countries will sit in Indonesia.

(6) The Prime Ministers agreed that the conference should have a broad and geographical basis and that all Asian and African countries with independent governments should be invited. With slight variations and modifications based on this fundamental principle, they decided to invite the following countries:

Afghanistan, Cambodia, Central African Federation, China, Egypt, Abyssinia, Gold Coast, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Nepal, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Yemen.

It is hoped that the above twenty-five countries, as well as the five sponsoring countries—Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan—will participate in the conference.

(7) The representatives attending the conference will be at the ministerial level, and it is hoped that each invited country will be represented by its Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, or Minister of Foreign Affairs, and send other representatives that the governments may wish to include in its delegation.

(8) The conference will decide its own rules of procedure and agenda. The general scope of the agenda has been stated in the section on the purpose of the conference.

(9) The Prime Ministers wish to point out that the acceptance of the invitation by any one country does not involve or even imply any change in its view of the status of any other country. It merely signifies that the invited country is generally in agreement with the purposes of the conference. They also bear firmly in mind the principle that the form of government and the way of life of any one country should in no way be subject to interference by any other. The views expressed by one or more of the participating countries at the conference shall not be binding on any other country, nor shall they be deemed to be accepted by any other country, unless the latter so desires. The fundamental purpose of the conference is to enable the countries concerned to better understand each other's views. The Prime Ministers hope that such clarification will enable all invited countries to accept the invitations to them.

(10) The Prime Ministers wish to state that their action in convening the Asian-African Conference is not with any exclusive desire on the part of the member states of the conference. They do not wish the countries attending the conference to organize themselves into a regional bloc.

(11) The Prime Ministers expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the Geneva Conference on Indochina and the cessation of hostilities. They expressed the hope that the Geneva Accords will be fully respected and implemented by all parties concerned, and that no external interference will hinder the successful implementation of these Accords.

(12) In accordance with their well-known attitude towards colonialism, the Prime Ministers took note of the West Irian issue. The Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, and Pakistan supported the position taken by Indonesia on this issue. They sincerely hope that the Dutch government will resume negotiations to fulfill its obligations under the solemn agreements it has concluded with Indonesia.

(13) The Prime Ministers reiterated their grave concern regarding the demands of the peoples of Tunisia and Morocco to achieve their national independence and legitimate right of self-determination.

(14) The Prime Ministers reiterated their serious concern about the destructive potential of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons explosions (which threaten not only their countries but the entire world) conducted for experimental purposes, as well as their long-term and undetermined consequences, which may cause permanent damage to human life and civilization.

They sincerely request all parties concerned to cease such experiments. They also request the Disarmament Commission to consider this issue immediately.

(15) The economic development of Asian countries, which is urgently needed for the happiness and welfare of their peoples, requires a planned approach in order to make the most effective use of available resources. An important prerequisite for such an approach is a full knowledge of these resources. Therefore, the material resources of each country, especially mineral and underground resources, should be investigated, and cooperation should be carried out in terms of the supply of technicians and other aspects.

(16) The Prime Ministers believe that economic cooperation in terms of the supply of technicians and other aspects should be brought to the attention of their governments. They believe that a committee of experts should be established to consider economic issues of common concern to their countries.

(17) The Prime Ministers, meeting on the eve of the New Year, sincerely hope that in 1955, friendly cooperation among the countries attending the conference and other countries will be further developed, and the cause of world peace will be promoted.

    （八）会议将决定它自己的议事程序和议程，议程的一般范围已在会议的目的一节中加以陈述。
    （九）总理们愿意指出，任何一个国家接受邀请，绝不牵涉到或甚至意味着它对于任何其他国家的地位所抱的看法有任何改变。它仅仅意味着，这个被邀请国是一般地同意会议的目的的。他们也牢牢记住这项原则，任何一国的政府形式和生活方式绝不应受到任何其他国家的干涉。一个或一个以上的参加国在会议上所表示的意见对任何其他国家都无约束力，也不应被认为是被任何其他国家所接受，除非后者希望这样。会议的基本目的是，使有关的国家能够更好地了解彼此的见解。总理们希望，这种澄清将使所有被邀请的国家都能接受对它们的邀请。

    他们真诚地要求一切有关方面终止这种试验。他们还要求裁军委员会立刻考虑这个问题。
    （十五）为它们人民的幸福和福利所迫切需要的亚洲国家的经济发展，需要采取一个有计划的办法，以便最有效地利用现有的资源。这种办法的一个重要先决条件就是充分知道这些资源。因此，应该调查每个国家的物质资源，特别是矿产和地下资源，应该在技术人员的供应方面和其他方面进行合作。
    （十六）总理们认为，在技术人员的供应方面和其他方面的经济上的合作应该得到他们政府的注意。他们认为应该成立一个由专家组成的委员会，考虑对他们国家共同有关的经济问题。
    （十七）在新年前夕举行会议的总理们真诚地希望：在一九五五年，出席会议的国家以及其他国家之间的友好合作将进一步发展，世界和平事业将得到促进。
