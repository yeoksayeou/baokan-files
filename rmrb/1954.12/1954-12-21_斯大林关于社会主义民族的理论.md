Stalin summarized the Soviet Union's experience in solving the national question during socialist construction, thus comprehensively demonstrating the Leninist theory and strategy on the national question. Based on the principles of Leninism, he clarified the emergence, development, and fundamental differences between socialist nations and bourgeois nations.

Historically, there are two types of nations: the old, i.e., bourgeois nations, and the new, i.e., socialist nations. Marxism-Leninism teaches that bourgeois nations are the inevitable product and form of the bourgeois era in social development. The fate of bourgeois nations is tied to the capitalist system. Due to the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, the rule of landlords and capitalists in Russia was completely overthrown, and the dictatorship of the proletariat was established. Thus, with the demise of the capitalist system, bourgeois nations also withdrew from the stage of history. Socialist nations, as the inevitable form of socialist society, took their place. This is the inevitable form of social development after the elimination of bourgeois nations until the elimination of national differences.

Stalin discussed the fundamental differences between socialist nations and bourgeois nations. The main leading force of bourgeois nations is the bourgeoisie and its nationalist parties. The ideological and socio-political content of bourgeois nations is: advocating class peace within the nation under the banner of "national unity"; plundering the territory of other nations to expand their own; distrust and hostility towards other nations; oppression of minority nationalities; and forming a united front with imperialism. The political basis of this type of nation is the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and the economic basis is capitalist private ownership and the system of exploitation of man by man. Bourgeois nationalism is the ideological system of this type of nation.

In contrast, the leading force of socialist nations is the working class and its internationalist party – the Communist Party. The spiritual and socio-political features of socialist nations are: establishing an alliance between the working class and the working peasantry within the nation to eliminate the remnants of capitalism and victoriously build socialism; eliminating the remnants of national oppression, enabling all nationalities and minority nationalities to obtain equal rights and free development; eliminating the remnants of nationalism to establish friendship among all nationalities and establish internationalism; and forming a united front with all oppressed and disenfranchised nations in the struggle against aggression and aggressive wars, and in the struggle against imperialism. The political basis of socialist nations is the dictatorship of the proletariat, which embodies socialist democracy; its economic basis is socialist public ownership; and its ideological system is proletarian internationalism and patriotism. The experience of the Soviet Union over more than 30 years has fully demonstrated the unparalleled superiority of socialist nations over bourgeois nations.

Unlike bourgeois nations, the emergence of socialist nations is not a spontaneous process. It is the result of the tremendous transformation activities carried out by the proletariat and its party, the Communist Party. This is a process of transforming the old, bourgeois nations into socialist nations in the socialist spirit on the ruins of the former. Moreover, this is a matter of an entire historical era (the period of transition from capitalism to socialism).

The national question and the peasant question are both integral parts of the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Stalin pointed out that the essence of the national question during the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat is to establish correct mutual relations between the proletariat of formerly powerful nations and the peasantry of formerly oppressed nations. This means that not only must the proletariat of formerly powerful nations establish a solid alliance with the working peasantry of their own nation, but also establish a solid alliance with the peasantry and other working masses of formerly oppressed nations. In this way, it is possible to eliminate the remnants of long-standing mutual distrust, enable the peoples of all nationalities to reach full understanding, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Precisely because of this, the complete abolition of national oppression, enabling all nationalities to obtain democratic freedom and equal development, consolidating the alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry of all nationalities, and consolidating friendly unity and mutual assistance among the peoples of all nationalities in the struggle to build socialism are the fundamental guarantees for building a socialist society in a multi-ethnic country.

Stalin emphasized that the friendly unity of the peoples of all nationalities, which arises on the basis of socialism, is one of the driving forces for the development of socialist society; it is one of the most important conditions for the strength and invincibility of the multi-ethnic Soviet state. He said: "...As long as this friendship exists, the peoples of our country are free and invincible." (Stalin's speech at the meeting of advanced male and female collective farmers and party and government leaders of the Tajik and Turkmen Republics on December 4, 1935)

In the process of the formation of socialist nations, it is necessary to eliminate the de facto inequality between nationalities and enable all backward nationalities to catch up with advanced nationalities in political, cultural, and economic terms. These nationalities were in various extremely different stages of social development at the beginning of the victory of the socialist revolution. Among them, in addition to those who had formed bourgeois nations before the revolution, there were also tribes, races, and ethnic groups that had not had time to embark on the path of industrial capitalism before the revolution. Therefore, in the process of socialist transformation of nationalities, a series of difficulties arose in eliminating patriarchal, feudal, and clan/tribal social relations, in converting nomadic peoples to settled life, in establishing national economic and cultural centers, and in formulating unified national languages. In view of this situation, Stalin pointed out that the Party must fully take into account the historical conditions, lifestyles, customs, cultural levels, and economic development characteristics of each nationality, and implement its policies flexibly and cautiously, so that its policies fully conform to national characteristics and local conditions.

Eliminating the de facto inequality of all nationalities comes from the principle of proletarian internationalism. This is an extremely arduous historical task facing the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletariat and its party believe that not only should the peoples of all nationalities be equal in law, but also in fact. This is an important condition for establishing fraternal cooperation among the peoples of all nationalities. Historically, nationalities with backward economic and cultural development lack a solid economic foundation, making them unable to fully enjoy the rights granted to them by national equality. Therefore, after the victory of the socialist revolution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the proletariat of advanced nationalities must help the working masses of backward nationalities develop their economy and culture, and help them catch up with advanced nationalities. Stalin pointed out, "Without such assistance, it is impossible to establish the peaceful coexistence and fraternal cooperation of the working people of all nationalities and tribes within a unified world economy, and this peaceful coexistence and fraternal cooperation is precisely what is necessary for the complete victory of socialism." ("On the Formulation of the National Question") In order to solve this historical task, the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat must take effective measures to gradually develop the economy of minority nationality areas, and plan to establish industries in various border areas, so that they can establish unified economic centers. At the same time, it is also necessary to develop national culture under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a national culture with a national form and socialist content. Its purpose is to educate the masses of all nationalities in the spirit of socialism and internationalism. This culture plays a huge role in the formation of socialist nations. In order to develop this culture, the state of the dictatorship of the proletariat must carry out a cultural revolution, formulate unified national languages, widely promote national education, establish schools, theaters, and other cultural institutions that use national languages; publish books and periodicals in national languages; and cultivate national cadres. Only by developing this national culture can backward nationalities truly participate in the cause of socialist construction. Only by using their own national languages can the masses of all nationalities make progress in cultural, political, and economic development. Only when the backward nationalities get rid of the backwardness left over from history can they fully exert their political initiative and gradually form socialist nations in the struggle to build socialism.

In the construction of the Soviet state, the Soviet national autonomy system was a problem that deserved attention. As early as 1913, Stalin pointed out in his work "Marxism and the National Question" that regional autonomy is an element in solving the national question. After the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, Stalin further elaborated on the issue of the Soviet national autonomy system based on the principles of Leninism. Stalin believed that implementing national regional autonomy is the only appropriate form for establishing an alliance between the central government and the border regions. Moreover, the Soviet national regional autonomy system is developed in various forms and to varying degrees to adapt to the conditions of various minority nationality areas. This is from narrow, administrative autonomy to broader, political autonomy, from broad political autonomy to even more expanded forms of autonomy, up to the highest form of autonomy, to treaty relations. The benefit of doing so is that it can include all kinds of border regions in various stages of cultural and economic development. Only because of such a policy did the Soviet regime "open a path deep into the remote and impoverished areas of the Russian border, mobilize the most backward and diverse masses in national relations to participate in political life, and connect these masses with the central government through various threads" ("The Soviet Regime's Policy on the Russian National Question").

Stalin repeatedly emphasized the significance of the nationalization of autonomous organs in his writings. The nationalization of autonomous organs is the central link in national regional autonomy. The nationalization of autonomous organs means that the power organs, party organs, social organizations such as trade unions, cooperatives, economic organs, schools, and cultural organs of the autonomous region are all managed by local people who are familiar with the local language and customs. In this way, they can perform their duties in accordance with the conditions of national life. Only in this way can the people of minority nationalities truly realize their political rights, and only in this way can they achieve economic and cultural prosperity within the unified multi-ethnic Soviet state. Regarding the significance of the nationalization of autonomous organs, Stalin gave a concise and vivid explanation in the following passage: "The national autonomy discussed here can be understood in such a way that there are people of your own in all management organs who know your language and your way of life. That is the meaning of autonomy. Autonomy must teach you to walk on your own legs. That is the purpose of autonomy." (Stalin's Collected Works, Volume 4, Russian edition, page 406)

In implementing the Party's policy of national regional autonomy, it is necessary to oppose various nationalist tendencies. And great-power chauvinism (i.e., great-nation nationalism) and local nationalism are two dangerous tendencies that must be overcome with all efforts. Stalin sharply criticized these two tendencies. He pointed out that the essence of great-power chauvinism is to try to ignore national differences in language, culture, and way of life. It is prepared to abolish national regions, undermine the principle of national equality, and abandon the Party's policy of nationalizing autonomous organs. And the essence of local nationalism is to try to obliterate class contradictions within its own nationality and to try to separate its own nationality from the general path of socialist construction. This reflects the dissatisfaction of the dying exploiting classes of formerly oppressed nationalities with the dictatorship of the proletariat, and their attempt to establish their own class rule. These two tendencies are particularly dangerous because they can damage the invincible source of all nationalities – the friendly unity of all nationalities.

The theories of Lenin and Stalin on socialist nations, and the experience of the Soviet Communist Party in solving the national question, are of great guiding significance for our country in solving the national question during the transition period.

The Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, in combination with China's specific historical conditions, creatively applied Marxist-Leninist theory and formulated the general task in the national question during China's transition period. This is: to consolidate the unity of the motherland and the unity of all nationalities, and jointly build the great family of the motherland; within the unified great family of the motherland, to guarantee the equality of all rights of all nationalities and implement national regional autonomy; in the common cause of building the motherland, to closely coordinate with the construction of the motherland, and gradually develop the political, economic, and cultural development of all nationalities (including steady and necessary social reforms), gradually eliminate the de facto inequality between nationalities left over from history, so that backward nationalities can enter the ranks of advanced nationalities, and gradually transition to socialist society. At the same time, based on China's specific historical conditions, the Party found the key to correctly solving China's national question – national regional autonomy.

In the five years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, thanks to the correct implementation by the Party and the People's Government of the general task in the national question during China's transition period, national oppression has been abolished, national regional autonomy has been vigorously promoted, and struggles have been carried out to gradually eliminate the de facto inequality between nationalities left over from history. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is one of the earliest established and largest in scale. Due to the implementation of national regional autonomy, the patriotic spirit and political enthusiasm of the peoples of all nationalities have been universally strengthened, and the unity among the peoples of all nationalities and within each nationality has been consolidated and enhanced. All minority nationalities have made varying degrees of progress in economic, political, and cultural development. Due to the development of production, the living standards of the people of all minority nationalities have also been improved. This fully proves that national regional autonomy is the key to correctly solving China's national question. This fully demonstrates that the Party's national policy is wise and correct. The Constitution of our country, adopted at the First Session of the First National People's Congress this year, has stipulated in legislative form the relationship of equality, fraternity, and mutual assistance among all nationalities in the country, and guaranteed the autonomous rights and equal and free development of all minority nationalities.

We firmly believe that, under the illumination of the Party's general line for the transition period and under the guidance of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the peoples of all nationalities in our country will strengthen friendly unity, cooperate closely, and build our country into a great socialist country along the path pointed out by Lenin and Stalin.

    斯大林关于社会主义民族的理论
    万峰
    斯大林总结了苏联在社会主义建设中解决民族问题的经验，因而全面地论证了列宁主义关于民族问题的理论和策略。他根据列宁主义的原理阐明了社会主义民族的产生、发展和它同资产阶级民族的原则区别。
    历史上有两种类型的民族：一种是旧的，即资产阶级民族；一种是新的，即社会主义民族。马克思列宁主义教导说，资产阶级民族是社会发展中资产阶级时代的必然产物和必然形式。资产阶级民族的命运是同资本主义制度维系在一起的。由于伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利，地主、资本家在俄国的统治完蛋了，无产阶级专政确立了。于是随着资本主义制度的消灭，资产阶级民族也就退出历史舞台。社会主义民族，作为社会主义社会的必然形式代之而起。这是在资产阶级民族消灭后直到民族差别消灭为止社会发展所必然采取的形式。
    斯大林论述了社会主义民族同资产阶级民族的原则区别。资产阶级民族的主要领导力量，是资产阶级和它的民族主义政党。资产阶级民族的思想内容和社会政治内容是：打着“民族统一”的旗号而鼓吹民族内部的阶级和平；掠夺其他民族的领土来扩大自己民族的领土；对其他民族不信任和仇视；压迫少数民族；同帝国主义结成统一战线。这种民族的政治基础是资产阶级专政，经济基础是资本主义私有制和人剥削人的制度。资产阶级民族主义是这种民族的思想体系。
    与此相反，社会主义民族的领导力量，则是工人阶级和它的国际主义政党——共产党。社会主义民族的精神面貌和社会政治面貌则是：在民族内部建立工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，以消灭资本主义残余和胜利地建设社会主义；消灭民族压迫的残余，使各民族及少数民族获得平等权利和自由发展；消灭民族主义的残余，以确立各族人民的友好和确立国际主义；在反对侵略及侵略战争的政策的斗争中、在反对帝国主义的斗争中与一切被压迫的和没有平等权利的民族结成统一战线。社会主义民族的政治基础是体现社会主义民主制的无产阶级专政；其经济基础是社会主义公有制；其思想体系是无产阶级的国际主义和爱国主义。苏联建国三十多年的经验，充分证明社会主义民族对资产阶级民族具有无比的优越性。
    跟资产阶级民族不同，社会主义民族的产生不是自发的过程。这是无产阶级及其政党共产党从事巨大的改造活动的结果。这是在旧的、资产阶级民族的废墟上，以社会主义精神把它改造成为社会主义民族的过程。而且这是整整一个历史时代（从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期）的事情。
    民族问题和农民问题，同是关于无产阶级专政问题的组成部分。斯大林指出过，无产阶级专政时期的民族问题，其实质就是从前强大民族的无产阶级同从前被压迫民族的农民确立正确的相互关系。这就是说，不仅要使从前强大民族的无产阶级同本民族的劳动农民确立巩固的联盟，而且要同从前被压迫的民族的农民及其他劳动群众确立巩固的联盟。这样就可以消除历史上由来已久的互不信任的残余思想，使各族人民达到充分谅解，巩固无产阶级专政。正是因为这样，所以，彻底废除民族压迫，使各民族获得民主自由和平权的发展，巩固无产阶级同各族农民的联盟，以及各族人民在为建立社会主义而斗争中巩固友好团结和互助的关系，乃是在多民族国家里建成社会主义社会的根本保证。
    斯大林着重指出：在社会主义基础上产生的各族人民的友好团结，是社会主义社会发展动力之一；是多民族苏维埃国家强大和不可战胜的最重要条件之一。他说过：“……只要这种友爱存在着，那我国各族人民就是自由的和不可战胜的。”（斯大林在一九三五年十二月四日在塔吉克和土尔克明尼亚共和国先进男女集体农庄庄员及党政领导者会议上的演说）
    在社会主义民族形成过程中，要铲除各民族间的事实上的不平等，使各落后民族能在政务、文化和经济方面赶上先进民族。这些民族，在社会主义革命胜利之初处在各种极不同的社会发展阶段。其中除了在革命前已形成资产阶级民族者外，还有的是在革命前未来得及走上工业资本主义道路的部族、种族、民族集团等等。因此，在民族的社会主义改造过程中，在消灭宗法、封建和氏族、种族的社会关系方面，在把游牧民族转为定居方面，在建立民族的经济和文化中心方面，以及在制定统一的民族语言等方面引起了一系列的困难。鉴于这种情况，斯大林指出，党就必须充分顾及到各民族的历史情况、生活方式、习惯、文化水平和经济发展的特点，灵活地慎重地执行自己的政策，使自己的政策完全符合民族特点和地方条件。
    铲除各民族事实上的不平等，这是来自无产阶级国际主义原则的。这是摆在无产阶级专政面前的一项极为艰巨的历史任务。无产阶级及其政党认为：不仅要使各族人民在法权上平等而且要使他们在事实上平等。这是建立各族人民兄弟般合作的重要条件。历史上经济、文化发展落后的民族，由于缺乏坚实的经济基础，以致无力充分享受民族平等所给予他们的权利。因此，社会主义革命胜利和无产阶级专政确立后，就必须使先进民族的无产阶级帮助落后民族的劳动群众发展经济和文化，帮助他们赶上先进的民族。斯大林指出，“没有这样的帮助，就不可能建立各民族和部族劳动者在统一的世界经济内的和平共居和兄弟般的合作，而这种和平共居和兄弟般的合作正是社会主义的彻底胜利所必需的。”（“谈谈民族问题的提法”）为了解决这项历史任务，无产阶级专政的国家就要采取有效措施，逐步地发展少数民族区的经济，有计划地建立各边疆区的工业，使他们建立起统一的经济中心。同时还要发展无产阶级专政条件下的民族文化。这是一种民族形式和社会主义内容的民族文化。它的目的就是用社会主义和国际主义的精神来教育各族人民群众。这种文化在社会主义民族形成中起着巨大的作用。为了发展这种文化，无产阶级专政的国家就必须开展文化革命，制定统一的民族语言，广泛地推行国民教育，开办使用民族语言的学校、剧院和其他文化机关；用民族语言出版书刊；培养民族干部。只有发展这种民族文化，才能使落后的民族真正地参加社会主义建设事业。各族人民群众，只有使用本民族的语言，才能在文化、政治、经济的发展中获得进步。只要各落后民族摆脱了历史上遗留下来的落后性，他们才可充分发挥政治积极性，在为建设社会主义而斗争中，逐渐形成为社会主义的民族。
    在苏维埃国家的建设中，苏维埃的民族自治制，曾是一个值得重视的问题。早在一九一三年，斯大林在“马克思主义与民族问题”的著作中，就曾指出区域自治是解决民族问题的一个要素。在无产阶级专政确立后，斯大林又根据列宁主义的原理进一步阐述了苏维埃的民族自治制问题。斯大林认为实行民族区域自治，是中央同边疆建立联盟的唯一适当形式。而且适应各少数民族区的条件，苏维埃民族区域自治是采取各种形式和不同的程度来发展的。这就是从狭隘的、行政上的自治到更广泛的、政治上的自治，从广泛的政治上的自治到更加扩大的自治形式，直到最高的自治形式，到条约关系。这样做的好处是能够把处在文化、经济发展各种不同阶段上的各式各样的边疆包括进来。只是由于这样的政策，苏维埃政权“才开辟了一条深入俄国边疆穷乡僻壤的大道，发动最落后的和在民族关系上各式各样的群众来参加政治生活，把这些群众用各式各样的线索跟中央联系起来”（“苏维埃政权对于俄国民族问题的政策”）。
    斯大林在他的著作中一再强调自治机关民族化的意义。自治机关的民族化，是民族区域自治的中心环节。自治机关民族化，就是使自治区的政权机关、党机关、工会等社会组织、合作社、经济机关、学校和文化机关，都是由熟悉当地语言和习惯的当地人来管理。这样，他们就能够适应民族生活的条件来执行自己的职务。只有这样，少数民族人民才能真正实现自己的政治权利，才能在统一的多民族苏维埃国家内使他们在经济、文化上达到繁荣。对于自治机关民族化的意义，斯大林曾用下面一段话作了简明而生动的解释：“这里所谈的民族自治，可以如此了解，为的是一切管理机关中，站有你们的人，知道你们的语言，你们的生活习惯，这就是自治的意义。自治必须教会你们用自己的腿走路，这就是自治的目的。”（斯大林全集第四卷，俄文版第四○六页）
    在贯彻党的民族区域自治政策中，必须反对各种民族主义的偏向。而大国沙文主义（即大民族主义）和地方民族主义是两种必须竭力克服的危险偏向。斯大林尖锐地批判了这两种偏向。他指出，大国沙文主义偏向的实质，就是极力漠视语言、文化、生活方式等的民族差别。它准备取消民族区域，破坏民族平等的原则和放弃党对自治机关民族化的政策。而地方民族主义偏向的实质，则是极力想抹煞本民族内部的阶级矛盾，想使本民族脱离社会主义建设总轨道。这反映从前被压迫民族中死亡了的剥削阶级对无产阶级专政不满，它们图谋确立自己的阶级统治。这两种偏向之所以特别危险，是因为它们能损害各族人民不可战胜的源泉——各族人民的友好团结。
    列宁、斯大林关于社会主义民族的理论，苏联共产党在解决民族问题上的经验，对于我国在过渡时期解决民族问题有着巨大的指导意义。
    中国共产党和毛主席结合我国具体历史条件，创造性地运用马克思列宁主义理论，制定了我国过渡时期在民族问题方面的总任务。这就是：巩固祖国的统一和民族的团结，共同建设祖国的大家庭；在统一的祖国大家庭内，保障各民族一切权利的平等，实行民族区域自治；在建设祖国的共同事业中，同祖国的建设密切配合起来，逐步地发展各民族的政治、经济和文化（其中包括稳步的和必要的社会改革在内），逐步地消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，使落后民族能进入先进民族的行列，逐步过渡到社会主义社会。同时，根据我国具体历史条件，党找到了民族区域自治这一正确解决我国民族问题的钥匙。
      中华人民共和国成立五年来，由于党和人民政府正确地执行了我国过渡时期在民族问题上的总任务，废除了民族压迫，大力推行了民族区域自治，并为逐步消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等而进行了斗争。而内蒙古自治区是建立最早、规模最大的一个。由于推行民族区域自治，普遍加强了各族人民爱国主义精神和政治积极性，巩固和增强了各族人民间及各民族内部的团结。各少数民族在经济、政治、文化上都有了不同程度的发展。由于生产的发展，各少数民族人民的生活水平也有了提高。这充分证明，民族区域自治是正确解决我国民族问题的钥匙。这充分说明了党的民族政策是英明的、正确的。今年第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议通过的我国宪法，已用立法形式规定了国内各民族的平等友爱互助关系，保障了各少数民族的自治权利和平等自由的发展。
    我们坚信，在党在国家过渡时期的总路线的照耀下，在中华人民共和国宪法的指引下，我国各族人民将沿着列宁、斯大林所指出的道路，加强友好团结，通力合作，来把我国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家。
