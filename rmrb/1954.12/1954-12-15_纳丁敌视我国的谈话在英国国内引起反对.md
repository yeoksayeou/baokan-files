Xinhua News Agency, London, December 14th: As can be seen from news received here from London, the war-mongering clamor against the Chinese people made by Harold Nutting, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and chief representative to the United Nations, in New York on the 12th, has aroused legitimate opposition in Britain. Six British Labour MPs already submitted a motion in the House of Commons on the 13th condemning and protesting Nutting’s remarks. This motion, proposed by these Labour MPs, requests the House to take note of Nutting's statements and expresses that Britain's obligations are not of the kind Nutting indicates.

Nutting claimed on a television program that day that if the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated Taiwan, it would be an attack on members of the United Nations, and "Britain, as a member of the United Nations, would certainly be involved."

People here note that the British government has so far made no responsible statement to indicate that the British government has not undertaken the obligations that Nutting claims to have undertaken. A British Foreign Office spokesman refused to comment at a press conference on the evening of the 13th, citing the fact that the full text of Nutting's speech had not yet been received.

Many reports received here indicate that Nutting's remarks have aroused widespread suspicion about British foreign policy. People here are closely watching the British government's attitude.

    纳丁敌视我国的谈话在英国国内引起反对
    【新华社十四日讯】从此间收到的伦敦消息中可以看出，英国外交副大臣、驻联合国首席代表纳丁十二日在纽约发表的敌视中国人民的战争叫嚣，已经在英国国内引起了正当的反对。有六位英国工党议员已经在十三日在下院提出了一项动议，谴责和抗议纳丁的谈话。这些工党议员提出的这个动议要求下院注意纳丁发表的谈话，并且表示英国的义务并不是纳丁所表明的那种义务。
    纳丁那天在电视节目中声称，如果中国人民解放台湾，那就是对联合国会员国的进攻，“英国作为联合国的一个会员国，当然将会卷进去。”
    此间人士注意的是，英国政府迄今没有作任何负责的表示，来表明英国政府并没有承担据纳丁说是已经承担的义务。英国外交部发言人在十三日晚间的记者招待会上借口纳丁发言的全文还没有得到而拒绝表示意见。
    此间收到的许多消息表明，纳丁的谈话已经引起了对于英国外交政策的广泛的怀疑。此间人士正在密切注意英国政府的态度。
