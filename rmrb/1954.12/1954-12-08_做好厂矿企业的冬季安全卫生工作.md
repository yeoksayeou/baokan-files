    Do a Good Job in Winter Safety and Hygiene Work in Factories and Mines
    Severe winter has arrived, and many new problems will arise in industrial production and capital construction. For example, the winter climate is dry, and workshops in factories and mines and winter construction sites often contain many flammable materials, such as coal, charcoal, shavings, and firewood. If insufficient attention is paid, fires can easily occur. Also, in winter construction projects, many workers have to work outdoors. If their working conditions are not improved, and if they are not educated to conscientiously implement safe operating procedures, accidents such as falls and frostbite may occur. Many pieces of equipment and products are also prone to accidents if they are not properly protected. For example, in the past, oil refineries often experienced freezing and solidification blockage accidents every winter. Because oil production is continuous, even if only one piece of equipment or one pipeline has an accident, it will affect the completion of the entire production task. Furthermore, in coal mines, if fire prevention, cold prevention, and anti-poisoning work are not taken seriously, accidents such as coal cannon roof collapses, gas outbursts, spontaneous combustion, and coal smoke poisoning can occur. In addition, if the indoor stoves are not carefully managed, carbon monoxide poisoning accidents can occur. The occurrence of these accidents will not only affect the comprehensive completion of the national plan, but also endanger the lives or health of employees.
    Everyone is very clear about the importance of cold protection, fire prevention, freeze prevention, and anti-poisoning work, and these tasks are carried out every winter, so many units have accumulated a lot of experience. Because of this, many comrades are prone to complacency and arrogance. Some unit leaders believe that winter prevention work has already been arranged and no longer ask about it; some units have drawn up winter prevention plans, but are slow to act; some enterprises have not yet formulated plans, and only add and improve some equipment and think the job is done; and some enterprises only pay attention to goods and equipment, but ignore ideological education for employees, so accidents still occur. In Beijing, since heating began this year, as of November 26, eight people have died from carbon monoxide poisoning.
    In order to ensure production safety and the health of employees, and to better complete the national plan, units that have not yet done a good job in winter safety and hygiene should immediately organize specialists to carry out this work. Units that have already done it should also immediately mobilize the masses of employees to conduct a thorough inspection. Recently, Northeast Oil Refinery No. 3 conducted an inspection of the plant's winter prevention work. In just one workshop, they found 117 items that needed to be prepared for cold protection, insulation, and fire prevention, such as the need to install steam fire extinguishing pipelines, machine safety baffles, etc.; in the employee dormitories, they also found 25 places where carbon monoxide poisoning could occur. After the inspection, they immediately took measures, and now these problems have been basically solved. It can be seen that it is very necessary to carry out an inspection. If loopholes are found during the inspection, they should be addressed immediately.
    The labor and health departments in various regions have a major responsibility for inspecting and supervising the winter safety and hygiene work of enterprises. They should actively assist factories and mines in overcoming complacency and slackness, and do a good job in winter safety and hygiene.

### 做好厂矿企业的冬季安全卫生工作

    做好厂矿企业的冬季安全卫生工作
    严冬来到了，工业生产和基本建设中都会出现许多新的问题。例如冬季气候干燥，而厂矿的车间和冬季施工的现场，常常放着很多易燃物品，如煤、木炭、刨花、木柴等，如果注意不够就容易引起火灾。又如冬季施工的工程，许多工人要在室外作业，如果不注意改善他们的作业条件，如果不教育他们切实贯彻安全操作规程，就可能发生摔伤、冻伤等事故。许多设备和产品如果保护得不好，也容易发生事故。例如过去石油厂每到冬季往往发生一些冻裂和凝固堵塞事故，而石油生产是连续的，只要有一件设备或是一根管线发生了事故，就会影响到整个生产任务的完成。再如在煤矿中，如果不注意防火、防冻、防毒工作，就会发生煤炮冒顶、瓦斯突出、自然发火、煤烟中毒等事故。此外，如果不注意管理室内的火炉，也会引起煤气中毒事故。这些事故的发生，不仅会影响国家计划的全面完成，而且会使职工的生命或身体健康受到损害。
    防寒、防火、防冻、防毒等工作的重要意义大家都是很清楚的，而且每年冬季都要作这些工作，许多单位也积累了不少的经验。正因为如此，许多同志就容易产生麻痹大意和自满的情绪。有些单位的领导上认为冬防工作早就布置过了，而不再过问；有的单位的冬防计划虽已订出，但行动迟缓；也有的企业至今还没有拟订计划，只添置和改进了部分设备就算完事；还有的企业只重视物品设备，却忽视对职工进行思想教育，因而事故仍有发生。北京市自今年开始生火取暖以来到十一月二十六日止，因煤气中毒死亡的就有八人。
    为了保证生产安全和职工的身体健康，更好地完成国家计划，目前还没有作好冬季安全卫生工作的单位，应立即组织专人抓紧进行。已经作了的单位，也应该立即发动职工群众深入地作一次检查。最近东北石油三厂进行了全厂冬防工作的检查，仅在一个车间里，就发现需要作一百一十七件防冻、保温、防火准备工作，如需要安装蒸气灭火管线、机器安全挡板等；在职工宿舍中也发现有二十五处可能发生煤气中毒的危险。经检查后，他们即采取措施，现在这些问题已基本上解决了。可见进行一次检查是很有必要的。在检查中发现漏洞，就应立即着手解决。
    各地的劳动、卫生部门对做好企业的冬季安全卫生工作负有检查督促的重大责任，他们应当积极地协助厂矿企业，克服麻痹和松懈情绪，做好冬季安全卫生工作。
