    Always on the Front Line
    ——A Visit to the Geological Department's 241 Exploration Team
  　Our Correspondent Liu Heng
    On the foremost front line of defending peace are tens of thousands of People's Volunteers; on the foremost front line of our country's industrial construction are a large number of geological explorers. By November, more than a hundred volunteers had come to the 241 Exploration Team, transferring from one front line to another.
    "This is another serious battle with imperialism!" Jiang Yaocun deeply remembered the regiment commander's powerful speech: "If we develop heavy industry, we can consolidate national defense. Engaging in geological exploration work is also striking at the enemy!"
      "Isn't it the happy life of the people that we shed blood to defend?" Li Shouheng often pondered the political commissar's sincere guidance:
  "A happy life requires constant creation. Our revolutionary army must not only stand on the foremost front line of combat but also stand on the foremost front line of production, constantly creating new happiness for the people!"
    Zhang Shuangzhi remembered most clearly the humorous conversation with the head of the personnel section:
  "You are the first shot, and you must make it count! If you make it count, we will send people to the geological departments in the future."
    The parting words of the leaders of the troops, like nails, were firmly nailed into the hearts of every volunteer, becoming a part of their thinking. Everyone was secretly swearing: "We must maintain our glory and carry it forward!"
      "Afraid of nothing!"
    The comrades who transferred from the Volunteers strictly abide by their oaths. On the foremost front line of defending the motherland, they were fearless warriors; on the foremost front line of industrial construction, no difficulty can scare them.
      "I'm not afraid of anything!" Zhou Haorong of the laboratory told me:
  "Cold? It's not colder than the weather in Korea, where the snow is half a person deep! Hard? It's not harder than the Korean battlefield, where the enemy is everywhere, above and below.
    "But, I was also afraid once!
    "That was when I first walked into the laboratory. I looked, and wow! Row after row, a long line of glass things: glass cups and glass bowls, glass dishes and glass jars, thin and short glass bottles, winding glass tubes. I thought: These are the hands that used to hold guns, smashing the enemy to pieces. How can I touch these delicate and fragile things? I was immediately stunned.
      "But I wasn't really afraid! I wasn't timid or shrinking at all. My fear was telling me: A new task has come, you must be more cautious, more humble, and work harder. You even have to change your temper!"
    In a few months, Zhou Haorong had trained himself into a qualified laboratory technician, leading the iron group to carry out iron ore analysis. The comrades in the laboratory told me: "Our group leader, who transferred from the Volunteers, usually likes to talk and laugh, jumping several feet high. But once he enters the laboratory, look at him—gentle and quiet, picking things up and putting them down gently, not talking, not laughing, not humming, not even daring to breathe loudly. If someone accidentally breaks a glass bottle, it will surely startle him. He says, 'It's louder than the cannons in Korea!'"
    "As long as you are willing to learn, there is nothing to be afraid of!" Zhang Shuangzhi, the captain of the geophysical prospecting team, told me: "I injured my leg in Korea and became a third-class disabled person. People said that geological exploration requires a lot of running. I said, running is running, what's so scary about that? No matter how high the mountain or how far the road, it's not as high or as far as the mountains and roads in Korea! And here, there's no need for night marches—but I was afraid of one thing:
    "Look, everyone else has a university or high school education, and I only graduated from elementary school! They use things like gravimeters and potentiometers, which I've never even heard of! How can I be a leader?
    "But this fear only flashed before me for a moment and then disappeared. I thought: You used to be a scout, scouting the enemy, and you weren't afraid! Now the leadership is transferring you to be an industrial scout, to scout iron ore. Are you afraid? Iron ore is dead, it won't move, and it won't eat people. There's no danger at all. If your education is low, improve it; if you don't know, learn it. No one is born a Zhuge Liang!
    "In the evening, I asked Huang Aizhen and He Jinru to teach me algebra and physics. During the day, I followed everyone up the mountain.
    "Unexpectedly, on the first day up the mountain, I made a big joke—"I saw everyone carrying levels and theodolites, running from one hilltop to another, measuring one measuring point after another. Suddenly, my heart tightened, and I immediately stopped them: 'The instruments are more valuable than gold. There are glass tubes on them. If you carry them on your shoulders, aren't you afraid of breaking them? Quickly unscrew them and put them in the boxes before carrying them away!' They said, 'There are no streets or alleys here, no tall buildings or mansions, no crowds of people. Where are we going to bump them?' I said, 'You have to climb over mountains and cross ditches. Aren't you afraid of falling?' Everyone laughed heartily. After laughing for a long time, He Qingrong finally stopped laughing and told me:
      "'Our geophysical prospecting is not ordinary! We have to run forty or fifty miles a day, measuring four or five hundred measuring points. We rely on sharp eyes, quick hands, and diligent legs! During the day, we have to race against the sun, and at night, we have to race against the moon. If we don't race, we won't make it! If we unscrew the instrument for every measuring point, put it in the box, open the box again, and screw it back on, how much time would that take? You're afraid we'll fall. We'll just be more careful.'
    "His explanation enlightened me, and I laughed along with everyone. While laughing, I said to myself: 'You don't understand too much. You have to learn, learn hard!'
    "Everyone was doing it, and I was watching. I asked questions as I watched, and everyone taught as they did...
    "After that, of course, there were still a few jokes. But you laugh, I'm not afraid! You laugh, and I laugh too! I don't understand, so of course you have to laugh; if you don't understand, won't I laugh too? If I understand why you're laughing, you won't laugh anymore. Later, sure enough, no one laughed at me anymore."
    Later, Zhang Shuangzhi became the captain that everyone respected and loved. The comrades of the geophysical prospecting team told me: "Captain Zhang is extremely humble. He asks when he doesn't understand, and he is also diligent. Every day at dawn, he knocks on every door, calling us to get up..."
    "Who doesn't praise them?"
    It's not just comrades Zhou Haorong and Zhang Shuangzhi. All the other hundred or so volunteers who transferred—all the comrades of Team 241—who doesn't praise them?
    I walked to the drilling team, and Tang Molin, Liu Siming, Fu Rang, Liu Guoqing, Duan Linxiang, Sun Dianyuan, Li Chenglian, Sun Defu, and other comrades took turns telling me:
      "The comrades who transferred from the Volunteers are the most determined to carry out tasks! When you assign them work, they take it as an order and must complete it. The team proposed: Don't throw away the old drill bits. The old drill bits can be flattened and used to grind sand. Xie Zhibin quickly organized the old drill bits after work, chiseling them and hammering them..."
      "The comrades from the Volunteers are the most active in their work! They are not afraid of being tired or getting dirty. They see work and do it. They work non-stop, rushing to do it. That day, Wang Yehai heard that the drilling machine was missing a part, and he immediately stood at attention and ran to another drilling machine to borrow it."
      "The comrades from the Volunteers are the most focused on learning technology. They concentrate on doing things at work and concentrate on listening in class, and they take notes in notebooks. He Lizhang said: 'If you don't study technology well, you will cause losses to the country.'"
    "The comrades from the Volunteers cherish the machines the most, wiping them and cleaning them whenever they have time. Cai Xianjun said: 'The workers' machines are like the soldiers' guns.'"
    "The comrades from the Volunteers have the best spirit of criticism and self-criticism, not caring about face at all, and not being coy at all. Yan Peiyang saw that two comrades in the class were irresponsible at work, so he had chats with them and found books for them to read. Slowly, they stopped sleeping at work, and their work also became more active."
    "The comrades from the Volunteers manage the diesel engines and have never had an accident."
    "The comrades from the Volunteers—never heard of anyone not coming to work."
    "The comrades from the Volunteers—they are truly the most lovable people!"
    I walked to the supply section, and Xiong Wenguang of the supply section told me:
    "Liu Chao, who came from the Volunteers, became a material clerk and improved our supply work. In the past, doing material work was an annoying job, taking flak from all sides—the drilling workers scolded you for not supplying materials in time, which forced the drilling rig to stop. The warehouse comrades scolded you for looking for the toilet only when you were desperate to shit. How can materials be supplied in time? Liu Chao, as a material clerk, often runs to the drilling rig, asking the machine captain, the class leader, and the workers: 'What's missing? What do you need? What's broken? What's running out?' He records the situation on the drill one by one, and when the time comes, he will never be late.
      "If you ask him where he learned this, he says he learned it from the army: it's called 'turning the passive state of being beaten into the active annihilation of the enemy.'"
    I walked to the blackboard newspaper and saw the blackboard newspaper praising the comrades from the Volunteers. I walked into the trade union office and casually flipped through the "Production News" published by the trade union and saw several articles praising the comrades who transferred from the Volunteers. One of them wrote:
    "Zhao Baiwan, who came from the Volunteers, does not take days off. Once, he came back from work and hadn't changed his clothes yet. A comrade who was taking over from him was sick, so he immediately returned to the drill. No matter how the class leader and comrades tried to persuade him, he wouldn't go back. He said: 'If one person is missing from the class, it will affect production. It doesn't matter if I work a few more hours and get a little tired.'"
    Finally, I walked into the captain's office. Captain Xu Jiakai said to me:
    "The comrades who came to our team from the Volunteers have all maintained the fine traditions of the army and brought new blood to our team. On the foremost front line of defending peace, they are charging soldiers; on the foremost front line of industrial construction, they are also backbone leaders. The People's Daily should praise them!"

    永远在前线
    ——地质部二四一勘探队访问记
  　本报记者　刘衡
    在保卫和平的最前线，有成千成万个人民志愿军；在我国工业建设的最前线，有大批地质勘探者。到十一月，已经有一百多位志愿军陆续来到二四一勘探队了，他们从一个前线转到了另外一个前线。
    “这是跟帝国主义的又一次严重的战斗！”江耀村深深记住了团长有力的演说：“我们发展了重工业，就可以巩固国防。搞地质勘探工作，也是在打击敌人！”
      “我们流血保卫的，不就是人民的幸福生活吗？”李守恒常常在琢磨政治委员诚恳的教导：
  “幸福生活需要不断的创造。我们革命军队不仅仅要站在战斗的最前线，而且要站在生产的最前线，不断地为人民创造新的幸福！”
    张霜芝记得最清楚的是人事科长幽默的谈话：
  “你们是头一炮，要打响啊！打响了，我们以后还要往地质部门送人。”
    部队首长们的临别赠言跟钉子一样，一个字一个字牢牢钉在每位志愿军的心里，已经成为他们思想的一部分了。他们每个人都在暗暗宣誓：“我们要保持光荣，发扬光荣！”
      “什么也不怕！”
    志愿军转业来的同志们严格地遵守着自己的誓言。在保卫祖国的最前线，他们曾经是无畏的勇士；在工业建设的最前线，任何困难也吓不倒他们。
      “我什么也不怕！”化验室的周浩荣对我说：
  “冷吗？再冷没有朝鲜天气冷，雪打半人深！苦吗？再苦没有朝鲜战场苦，天上地下都有敌人。
    “可是，我也曾经害过怕！
    “那是在我刚刚走进化验室的时候。一看，好家伙！一排排，一溜溜，尽是玻璃东西：玻璃杯儿玻璃碗，玻璃碟子玻璃罐，又细又矮的玻璃瓶子，曲里拐弯的玻璃管儿。我想：我这是双拿枪杆的手呀，把敌人打得哗里哗啦的，怎么能碰这些个又娇又脆的玩艺儿？一下子，就把我吓呆了。
      “可是，我并不是真的害了怕呀！我一点也没有胆小畏缩。我这个害怕在告诉我：新任务来了，你必须更加谨慎小心，更加虚心努力，连脾气都得改一改！”
    几个月功夫，周浩荣已经把自己锻炼成一个道地的化验员，领导铁组进行铁矿的化验工作了。化验室的同志们告诉我：“我们这位从志愿军转业来的组长，平时倒是爱说爱闹，一蹦几尺高。一进化验室，你看他——轻手轻脚，轻拿轻放，不说不笑，不哼不哈，连口大气都不敢出。要是有谁不小心打破一个玻璃瓶子，准会吓他一跳。他说：‘比朝鲜的大炮还响！’”
    “只要肯学习，是没有什么可怕的！”物理探矿队队长张霜芝对我说：“我在朝鲜伤了腿，成了三等残废。人家说，搞地质勘探要跑路。我说，跑路就跑路吧，这有什么可怕的？你山再高，路再远，总没有朝鲜的山高路远！而且在这里，又不要连夜行军——可是，我就害怕一桩：
    “你看，人家都是大学的，高中的，我才小学毕业！人家用的是些什么重力仪，电位仪，我连听都没听说过！怎么能够当领导呀？
    “可是这个害怕，只在我跟前幌了一幌，就没有了。我想：你以前当侦察兵，侦察敌人，都没害过怕！如今领导上调你当工业侦察兵，去侦察铁矿，你就害怕了吗？铁矿是死的，它不会动，又不会吃人，一点危险也没有。你文化低，就提高呗；你不会，就学呗，谁也不是天生下来的诸葛亮！
    “晚上，我找黄爱珍、何锦如给我教代数，教物理。白天，我跟着大伙儿上山去。
    “没想到，头一天上山，我就闹了一个大笑话——“我见大伙儿扛着水准仪，扛着经纬仪，从一个山头跑到另外一个山头，测了一个测点又测一个测点。忽然，我心头一紧，立刻喊住他们：‘仪器比金子还要贵重啊，上面有玻璃管子，你们扛在肩上，不怕把它碰破了？赶快把它拧下来，装在箱子里头，再带走！’他们说：‘这儿又没有大街小巷，又没有高楼大厦，又没有人山人海，往哪儿去碰啊？’我说：‘你们要翻山越岭，跳沟过渠啊，就不怕摔一跤？’大家都哈哈大笑了。笑了半天，何庆荣才忍住笑，讲给我听：
      “‘咱们这个物理探矿可不平常！一天要跑四、五十里路，测四、五百个测点，靠的就是个眼明手快腿勤！白天，我们要抢太阳，黑里要抢月亮，不抢就不行！测一个测点，就把仪器拧下来，再装箱，装箱了再打开，再拧上去，你算算，这要耽搁多少时间？你害怕我们摔跤，我们小心点就是。’
    “他这一讲，才把我讲开了窍，我也跟着大伙儿笑了。一边笑，一边我在心里对自己说：‘你不懂的太多了，要学啊，加紧地学！’
    “大伙儿在一边做，我在一边看。我随看随问，大伙儿随做随教……
    “以后，当然还闹过几次笑话。不过，你笑吧，我不怕！你笑我也笑！我不懂嘛，你当然要笑；你不懂，我还不是也要笑？我懂得你为什么笑，你就不会再笑了。到后来，果然没有人再笑我了。”
    到后来，张霜芝已经成为大家所尊敬爱戴的队长。物理探矿队的同志告诉我：“张队长虚心极了，他不懂就问，他人又勤快，每天天麻麻亮，他就一个房门一个房门地喊，喊我们起床……”
    “谁不称赞他们？”
    不光是周浩荣、张霜芝两位同志，其他一百多位志愿军转业人员——二四一队全体同志谁不称赞他们？
    我走到钻探队，钻探队的唐墨林、刘思明、傅让、刘国清、段麟祥、孙殿元、李成廉、孙德福等同志就你一嘴，我一嘴，抢着告诉我：
      “志愿军转业来的同志执行任务最坚决了！你给他分配工作，他把它当作是命令，一定要完成。队上提出：不要把旧钻头丢了，旧钻头打平了还可以啃砂子。谢志斌一下班就赶快整理旧钻头，用凿子凿，用锤子捶……”
      “志愿军来的同志干活最积极了！他们不怕累，不怕脏，眼里有活就去干。他们不停手地干，抢着活干。那天，王业海听说钻机缺了个零件，他连忙打了个立正，跑步就到别的钻机借去了。”
      “志愿军来的同志学习技术最专心了。上班聚精会神地做，上课聚精会神地听，还一本一本地记笔记。何里章说：‘不好好学习技术，就要给国家造成损失。’”
    “志愿军来的同志最爱护机器了，一有空就擦，就打扫。蔡显钧说：‘工人的机器就是战士的枪。’”
    “志愿军来的同志批评和自我批评的精神最好了，一点不顾情面，一点也不扭扭捏捏。阎培养看见班上有两位同志工作不负责任，就找他们漫谈，找书给他们看。慢慢，他们上班不睡觉了，工作也积极起来了。”
    “志愿军来的同志管柴油机，没出过事故。”
    “志愿军来的同志——没听说过有不上班的。”
    “志愿军来的同志——他们真是最可爱的人！”
    我走到供应科，供应科的熊文光告诉我：
    “志愿军来的刘超当了材料员，把我们的供应工作提高了一步。以前，干材料工作是个呕气活，要几头受气——钻探工人骂你不及时供应材料，害得钻机房只好停钻。仓库同志又骂你屎蹩急了才找茅房，材料怎么供应得上？刘超当了材料员，经常跑到钻机房，问机长，问班长，问工人：‘缺啥啦？要啥啦？什么东西使坏啦？什么东西快用光啦？’他把钻上的情况一一记下来，到时候，准误不了。
      “要问他从哪儿学来的这一套？他说，是从部队学来的：叫做‘把被动的挨打状态变成主动的歼灭敌人。’”
    我走到黑板报旁边，就看见黑板报在歌颂志愿军来的同志。我走进工会办公室，顺手翻了翻工会出版的“生产报”，就看见了好几篇表扬志愿军转业来的同志的稿子。其中有一篇写的是：
    “志愿军来的赵百万不轮休。有次他下班回来，还没换衣，接班的一位同志病了，他立即回到钻上。班长、同志们怎样劝说，他也不回去。他说：‘班上少了一个人，就要影响生产。我自己多工作几小时，累点没关系。’”
    最后，我走进了队长室。队长徐家楷对我说：
    “咱们队上的从志愿军来的同志一个一个都保持了部队的优良传统，给咱们队上带来了新的血液。在保卫和平的最前线，他们是冲锋陷阵的战士；在工业建设的最前线，他们也是骨干带头的人。人民日报应该表扬表扬他们！”
