Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 3rd: According to Indian news sources, the Indian government, in a reply note to the Portuguese Legation in India, warned the Portuguese government that using force against the people of Goa, who are peacefully striving for freedom from Portuguese colonial rule, may cause serious reactions among the Indian people (including the people of Goa).

The Indian government's note, after refuting the Portuguese note's claim that its possessions in India were being "harassed" at the "border," pointed out that the Portuguese government continues to ignore the historical changes that have taken place and stubbornly refers to these areas thousands of miles away from Portugal as a province of Portuguese territory. The Portuguese government continues to say that the local people have no desire for freedom, but at the same time, the large-scale arrests that began on June 18th are still continuing.

    印度政府警告葡萄牙政府
    对果阿人民使用武力可能引起严重反应
    【新华社新德里三日电】据印度新闻处消息：印度政府在向葡萄牙驻印度公使馆提出的一份复照中，警告葡萄牙政府注意：使用武力对付以和平方式争取从葡萄牙殖民统治下取得自由的果阿人民，可能在印度人民（包括果阿人民在内）中引起严重的反应。
    印度政府的照会在驳斥了葡萄牙照会中所谓它在印度的属地的“边界”受到“骚扰”的说法以后指出，葡萄牙政府继续无视已经发生的历史变化，硬把这些离开葡萄牙几千英里的地区说成是葡萄牙领土的一个省份。葡萄牙政府继续说当地人民并没有对于自由的要求，但是同时，从六月十八日开始的大规模逮捕到现在仍在继续。
