Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 11th: "Pravda," "Izvestia," and "Red Star" continued to publish commentaries on the 10th, condemning the U.S.-Chiang "mutual defense treaty."

　　"Pravda" published an article by Torkunov entitled "Liberating Taiwan is the Sovereignty of the Chinese People." The article wrote that the U.S. propaganda machine is doing its best to make world opinion believe that the "mutual defense treaty" recently concluded by the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is defensive in nature. However, it is difficult to make people believe this, just as it is difficult to call black white. The purpose of the "mutual defense treaty" is to legalize the U.S.'s armed occupation of Taiwan, Chinese territory. Taiwan has been used by the U.S. as a base for expanding aggression against China and preparing for another war. This treaty openly encourages Chiang Kai-shek bandits to attack the Chinese mainland. The U.S. and the Chiang Kai-shek clique agreed that the scope of armed action could be expanded to other areas. The article writes: It is very clear that the U.S. occupation of Taiwan and the signing of the treaty with Chiang Kai-shek is a violation of its own obligations and a crime of aggression against China.

　　The article concludes by pointing out that the Chinese people's will to liberate Taiwan is dear and understandable to all peace-loving people. This is an action by the Chinese people to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity.

　　"Izvestia" published an article by Rogov entitled "The Shameful Provocative Actions of the United States Against the Chinese People." The article pointed out that just as the Paris Accords meant the sharpening of the European situation and the increase of the danger of a new war, the treaty concluded between the U.S. and the Chiang Kai-shek clique means the increase of the danger of war in Asia and the Pacific. The U.S.'s attempt to portray the treaty signed with the Chiang Kai-shek clique as a "defensive treaty" is extremely absurd, because U.S. leaders have long revealed their ambition to piece together a new military bloc in Northeast Asia.

　　The article pointed out that the Washington treaty signed between the U.S. and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits is not only a brazen provocation against the great Chinese people, but also a provocation against all peace-loving people, because it arrogantly violates all recognized principles of international law and turns various international agreements into waste paper, just as the fascist aggressors did in Europe and Asia not long ago. Therefore, peace-loving people of all countries warmly support Zhou Enlai's statement expressing serious protest against the provocative conspiracy of the U.S. aggressor group.

　　The article concludes by writing that the Soviet people fully sympathize with the just demands of the Government of the People's Republic of China and their friends and allies—the great 600 million Chinese people.

　　"Red Star" published an article entitled "Aggressors Cannot Escape Responsibility." The article commented on the recent series of U.S. military activities in Taiwan. The article pointed out that no threats from the U.S. aggressors can intimidate the great 600 million Chinese people who are courageous in defending their sovereignty, freedom, independence, and territorial integrity.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 12th: According to the Romanian News Agency, "Spark" published an article entitled "The Chinese People are Determined to Defend Their Sacred Rights to Taiwan." The article said that the attempt by the U.S. aggressors to portray the U.S.-Chiang treaty as a "defensive" treaty is futile. The purpose of this new treaty is to make the U.S. occupation of Taiwan permanent and directly incite the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out new provocations against the Chinese people. People all over the world rightly regard this new aggressive collusion between the U.S. and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as a serious interference in the internal affairs of the Chinese people and a serious threat to peace.

　　The article said: Liberating Taiwan is the sovereignty of the Chinese people, and they will not allow anyone to hinder them from completing this historical task. As for the Chinese people, they know their own strength. In the struggle to uphold their just cause, they have the sympathy and support of the people of countries in the peace and socialist camp, and the sympathy of all peace-loving forces. Those who think that the great Chinese people can be intimidated are greatly mistaken.

### 苏联和罗马尼亚两国舆论  斥责美蒋签订威胁和平的侵略性军事公约

    苏联和罗马尼亚两国舆论
    斥责美蒋签订威胁和平的侵略性军事公约
    【新华社莫斯科十一日电】“真理报”、“消息报”、“红星报”十日继续发表评论，斥责美蒋“共同防御条约”。
    “真理报”刊载了托尔库诺夫写的一篇题为“解放台湾是中国人民的主权”的文章。文章写道，美国宣传机器正在用尽力量想使世界舆论相信美国政府最近和蒋介石卖国集团缔结的“共同防御条约”是防御性质的。但是，要使人们相信这一点是很困难的，正如要把黑的说成白的一样。“共同防御条约”的目的是要使美国武装侵占中国的领土台湾合法化。台湾已被美国用来作为扩大侵略中国和准备另一次战争的基地。这个条约公开鼓励蒋介石匪徒攻击中国大陆。美国和蒋介石集团协议，武装行动的范围可以扩大到其他地区。文章写道：非常明显，美国侵占了台湾并且同蒋介石签订了条约，是违反了自己所承担的义务，犯了侵略中国的罪行。
    文章最后指出，中国人民解放台湾的意志对于一切爱好和平的人们来说都是亲切的和可以理解的。这是中国人民保卫自己主权和领土完整的行动。
      “消息报”刊载了罗果夫写的一篇题为“美国对中国人民的可耻的挑衅行动”的文章。文章指出，正如巴黎协定意味着欧洲局势的尖锐化和新战争危险的增加一样，美国和蒋介石集团缔结的条约意味着亚洲和太平洋地区的战争危险的增加。美国企图把同蒋介石集团签订的条约说成是
  “防御条约”是非常荒谬的，因为美国的领袖人物早就透露出要在东北亚拼凑一个新的军事集团的野心。
    文章指出，美国和蒋介石匪帮签订的华盛顿条约不仅是对伟大的中国人民的无耻挑衅，同时也是对所有爱好和平人民的挑衅，因为它狂妄地破坏了一切公认的国际法原则，把各种国际协议变为废纸，正如不久以前法西斯侵略者在欧洲和亚洲所做的一样。因此，爱好和平的各国人民热烈地支持周恩来对美国侵略集团的挑衅阴谋表示严重抗议的声明。
    文章最后写道，苏联人民完全同情中华人民共和国政府和他们的朋友和盟友——伟大的六亿中国人民的正义要求。
    “红星报”发表了一篇题为“侵略者是逃避不掉责任的”的文章。文章评述了美国最近在台湾的一连串军事活动。文章指出，美国侵略者的任何威胁都不能吓倒伟大的、勇于保卫自己的主权、自由、独立和领土完整的六亿中国人民。
    【新华社十二日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特十一日讯：“火花报”登载了一篇题为
  “中国人民决心保卫他们对台湾的神圣权利”的文章。文章说，美国侵略者把美蒋条约说成是一个“防御性”的条约的企图是徒然的。这个新条约的目的在于使美国对台湾的侵占永久化，并且直接怂恿蒋介石卖国集团对中国人民进行新的挑衅。全世界人民正当地把美国和蒋介石卖国集团之间的这个新的侵略勾结看作是对中国人民内政的严重干涉和对和平的严重威胁。
    文章说：解放台湾是中国人民的主权，他们不允许任何人阻挠他们完成这个历史任务。至于中国人民，他们是知道自己的力量的，在维护他们的正义事业的斗争中，他们有着和平和社会主义阵营各国人民的同情和支持，有着一切爱好和平的力量的同情。那些以为伟大的中国人民会被吓倒的人们是大错而特错了。
