    The West Irian Question Should Be Resolved Reasonably
    Su Lan
    The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the West Irian issue on November 23. In its proposal on the West Irian issue, the Indonesian delegation requested the United Nations General Assembly to urge the governments of Indonesia and the Netherlands to resume negotiations without delay in accordance with the Round Table Conference agreement, with a view to reaching an agreement on the political status of West Irian at an early date. In the debates in recent days, representatives of many countries, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, India, Burma, and Bolivia, have expressed their approval and support for the Indonesian proposal, and believe that this request of Indonesia is reasonable and should be supported by the United Nations General Assembly.

    West Irian is a legitimate part of the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. It is not only geographically adjacent to the Indonesian archipelago and has close ties with Indonesia, but before the Second World War, West Irian was included in the territory of "Dutch East Indies" and was an administrative region of it. This means that even the Dutch colonists themselves had long recognized that Indonesia and West Irian were an inseparable whole. However, due to the heroic struggle of the Indonesian people, after the Dutch colonists were forced to recognize the independence of Indonesia, they refused to transfer the sovereignty of West Irian to the Republic of Indonesia. Although according to the provisions of the Hague Round Table Conference Agreement of 1949, the Dutch and Indonesian governments should decide the political status of West Irian through negotiations within one year, subsequent facts have proved that the Dutch colonists have always adopted an unreasonable attitude on this issue and even refused to negotiate, so that the issue of West Irian's return to Indonesia has not yet been reasonably resolved.

    The Dutch representative to the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Baruch, publicly stated during the debate that the Netherlands would continue to occupy West Irian and refused to resume negotiations with the Indonesian government. This is as the Indonesian representative, Mr. Sugavo, pointed out in his speech: the Dutch ruling group "clings to colonialism as a last straw in the rising tide of nationalism and freedom in Asia." For more than a hundred years, the Dutch colonial rulers have wantonly plundered West Irian, so that the economic and cultural life of the local residents is still in an extremely backward and primitive state.

    In this tyrannical colonial plunder of West Irian, American monopoly capital is increasingly becoming a tyrannical force. American monopoly capitalists intervened in West Irian as early as before the Second World War. For example, in 1934, the Netherlands leased the Voglekop Peninsula to an oil company representing "New York Mobil Oil Company," "Shell Federal Petroleum Company," and "Atlantic Refining Company" for a period of seventy-five years. This company obtained the patent right to explore for oil.

    The American aggressor group not only regards West Irian as a source of profit plunder for American monopoly capital overseas, but also attempts to turn West Irian into an American military base. Before the Netherlands and Indonesia held negotiations on the West Irian issue in December 1950, the United States obtained the consent of the Netherlands and obtained the priority right to establish military bases in West Irian. In recent years, under the instructions of the American aggressor group, the Netherlands has continuously strengthened its military strength and facilities in West Irian and has built several airports. As an Indonesian "Eternal Daily" reporter pointed out in a report this June: The United States is colluding with the Netherlands and Australia to turn West Irian Island into a military base as part of the American war preparation plan. The report continued to reveal that the United States had assured the Netherlands that it would support the Netherlands' opposition to Indonesia's demand to recover West Irian, and the Netherlands promised to give the United States the establishment of a huge military base in West Irian as a reward. Aluzi Katawenata, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Indonesian Islamic Union Party, also pointed out in a press conference that American policy is an obstacle to Indonesia's recovery of West Irian. Baldwin, a military commentator for the American aggressor group's mouthpiece, the "New York Times," publicly stated in a recent article: "Any political decision regarding the transfer of West New Guinea (i.e., West Irian - editor's note) to Indonesian jurisdiction would weaken the US military position in the Pacific." This fully exposes the American aggressor group's ambition for West Irian.

    This activity of the American aggressor group not only infringes upon Indonesia's sovereignty and threatens Indonesia's security, but also increases the unrest in the Southeast Asian region. The Indonesian people and the people of Asian countries do not allow the American aggressor group to create war threats in Asia and support corrupt colonial rule.

    For several years, Indonesia has been constantly demanding the recovery of West Irian. This demand is for the integrity of its national territorial sovereignty and to ensure its own security, and is therefore just. The Dutch government's attitude of refusing to negotiate is completely untenable and violates the provisions of the 1949 Round Table Conference Agreement. The United Nations General Assembly should make a correct decision on this issue in accordance with Indonesia's demands, because this issue is not only the national demand of Indonesia, but also relates to the interests of peace and security in Southeast Asia and Asia.

    西伊里安问题应该得到合理的解决
    苏蓝
    联合国大会政治委员会已于十一月二十三日开始讨论西伊里安问题。印度尼西亚代表团在关于西伊里安问题的提案中，要求联合国大会敦促印度尼西亚和荷兰两国政府按照圆桌会议的协议，毫不拖延地恢复谈判，以期早日在西伊里安的政治地位问题上获得协议。在最近几天的辩论中，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、印度、缅甸、玻利维亚等许多国家的代表都表示赞成和支持印度尼西亚的提案，并认为印度尼西亚的这个要求是合情合理的，应当得到联合国大会的支持。
    西伊里安是印度尼西亚共和国的合法领土的一部分。它不仅在地理上和印度尼西亚群岛毗连，同印度尼西亚有着密切的关系，而且在第二次世界大战以前，西伊里安曾被包括在“荷属东印度”的版图之内，是它的一个行政区域。这就是说连荷兰殖民者自己也早就承认了印度尼西亚和西伊里安是一个不可分割的整体。但是，由于印度尼西亚人民的英勇斗争，荷兰殖民者在被迫承认了印度尼西亚的独立之后，却不肯把西伊里安的主权移交给印度尼西亚共和国。虽然根据一九四九年的海牙圆桌会议协定的规定，荷兰和印度尼西亚政府应该在一年之内通过谈判来决定西伊里安的政治地位问题，然而以后的事实证明，荷兰殖民者在这个问题上一直采取了无理的态度，甚至拒绝谈判，以至西伊里安归还印度尼西亚的问题至今未能得到合理的解决。
    荷兰出席联合国大会政治委员会的代表巴鲁塞克，在辩论中公开表示荷兰将继续霸占西伊里安，而拒绝同印度尼西亚政府恢复谈判。这正如印度尼西亚代表苏加沃在发言中所指出的：荷兰统治集团
  “在亚洲日益高涨的民族主义和自由的汪洋大海中死死抱住殖民主义这样最后一根草”。荷兰殖民统治者一百多年来在西伊里安恣意掠夺，使当地居民的经济和文化生活至今仍处于极端落后的原始状态。
    在对西伊里安的这种横暴的殖民掠夺中，美国垄断资本越来越成为一个横暴的力量。美国垄断资本家早在第二次世界大战以前，便插足到西伊里安。例如，一九三四年荷兰便把窝格柯普半岛租给代表“纽约美孚油公司”、“壳牌联邦石油公司”和“大西洋炼油公司”的石油公司，为期七十五年。这个公司获得了钻探石油的专利权。
    美国侵略集团不仅把西伊里安看作是美国垄断资本在海外掠夺利润的一个来源，并且企图把西伊里安变为美国的军事基地。在一九五○年十二月荷兰和印度尼西亚就西伊里安问题举行谈判之前，美国就得到荷兰的同意，取得了在西伊里安建立军事基地的优先权。几年来，在美国侵略集团的指使下，荷兰不断地加强它在西伊里安的军事力量和设施，已经建筑了好几个飞机场。正如今年六月印度尼西亚“永恒报”的记者在一篇报道中所指出的：美国正在勾结荷兰和澳大利亚把西伊里安岛变为军事基地，作为美国备战计划的一部分。这篇报道并继续揭露说：美国曾向荷兰保证，支持荷兰反对印度尼西亚收回西伊里安的要求，而荷兰答应给予美国在西伊里安建立庞大军事基地作为报酬。印度尼西亚回教联盟党中央执行委员会主席阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔在一次记者招待会上发表的谈话中，也曾指出：美国政策是印度尼西亚收回西伊里安的障碍。美国侵略集团的喉舌、“纽约时报”军事评论员鲍德温在最近发表的文章中更公开表示：“关于把西新畿内亚（即西伊里安——编者注）移交印度尼西亚管辖的任何政治决定都会削弱美国在太平洋中的军事地位”。这就充分暴露了美国侵略集团对西伊里安的野心。
    美国侵略集团的这种活动，不但侵犯了印度尼西亚的主权，威胁着印度尼西亚的安全，并增加了东南亚地区的不安。印度尼西亚人民和亚洲各国人民都不容许美国侵略集团在亚洲制造战争威胁和支持腐朽的殖民统治。
    几年来，印度尼西亚不断要求收回西伊里安。这个要求是为了求得自己国家领土主权的完整和保障自己的安全，因而是正义的。荷兰政府拒绝谈判的态度完全站不住脚，也违反了一九四九年圆桌会议协定的规定。联合国大会应该按照印度尼西亚的要求对这个问题作出正确的决定，因为这个问题不仅是印度尼西亚的全民要求，而且也关系着东南亚和亚洲的和平和安全的利益。
