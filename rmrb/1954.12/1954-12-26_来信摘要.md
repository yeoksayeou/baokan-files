Letter Summary

Attention Should be Paid to the Examination and Education of Grassroots Economic Workers

Letters from Shi Zhiming and others: After the anti-corruption struggle, new corruption incidents continue to occur in grassroots organizations in Hejian, Yanshan, Wuqiao, and other counties in Hebei Province. More than 90% of those who commit corruption are salespersons, accountants, and warehouse keepers.

The reasons for corruption are: Firstly, with the development of our construction undertakings, state organs and state-owned enterprises have promoted a large number of new staff members, most of whom have not received education from the "Three-Anti" movement, and some of them have bourgeois exploitative ideas. Secondly, some leaders of institutions have serious bureaucracy and are not vigilant against corruption and theft. They even turn a blind eye to discovered problems and fail to deal with them. Some department leaders only care about business and not politics, only pay attention to the operation of commodities, and neglect the safekeeping and inspection of state property, thus giving corrupt elements an opportunity. Thirdly, a small number of counter-revolutionaries have infiltrated state organs and economic departments to carry out sabotage. I think these problems should attract attention from all regions.

Why Send Such "Urgent" Telegrams?

Letter from reader Tian Lu: The Planning Department of the Coal Mine Management Bureau decided to hold a national coal mine planning conference on August 25th and notified the various coal mine administrations of the conference content and participants at the end of July. In mid-August, the Planning Department held a preparatory meeting and decided to add conference content and prepare conference materials, postponing the meeting to September 1st. Therefore, they hurriedly drafted a notice of more than 4,300 words and sent it to relevant units as an "urgent" telegram. Because the number of participants was not well considered when writing this notice, another "urgent" telegram was sent afterward to correct it. Sending these two telegrams cost a total of more than 100 million yuan in telegraph fees.

Before sending the telegrams, the Confidentiality Section of the Coal Mine Management Bureau had suggested: some units are far from Beijing, and the people attending the meeting may have already set off before receiving the "urgent" telegrams. In fact, some comrades in the Southwest Region had already arrived in Beijing at that time. The leaders of the Planning Department also knew this situation, but still instructed to send telegrams, with the reason being: "Even if the comrades attending the meeting have set off, it's good for the leaders of their units to see it."

Cotton Purchasing Agencies in Shanxi and Shaanxi Provinces Can Still be Streamlined

Letter from Wang Shoulun, Jinnan Branch of China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company: The problem of overlapping cotton purchasing agencies in the grassroots units of China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company has been partially resolved. After this issue was published in the People's Daily on June 28th, due to the importance attached by the head office and the overall interests taken care of by the Shanxi and Henan Provincial Companies, the agencies stationed in Lingbao and Shanxian by the former Yuncheng Purchasing and Supply Wholesale Station have been withdrawn. According to the business situation in September, a total of 9.68 million yuan has been saved in wages and management fees, and 116.616 million yuan can be saved annually. I sincerely thank the party newspaper for its support of the opinions of the masses. However, regrettably, the transshipment agency stationed in Tongguan, Shaanxi, has not been resolved. This unit is three times larger than the agencies in Lingbao and Shanxian. If it can be resolved reasonably, it will save the country more wealth. I hope that the head office and the Shanxi and Shaanxi Provincial Companies will continue to study and resolve this issue.

Erroneous Thoughts of Oil Crop Purchasing Agents

Letter from Yang Chonghe, Heilongjiang Province: Some problems still exist in the acquisition of oil crops in some grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province: 1. Many purchasing agents believe that sporadic oil crops are not included in the planned purchases and give up purchasing them; 2. They are unwilling to purchase oil crops with low yields, emphasizing poor quality, sporadic quantities, and miscellaneous varieties; some supply and marketing cooperatives even sell the sunflowers they have already purchased from farmers back to private individuals for snacks; 3. They do not promptly purchase perilla seeds, hemp, and flaxseeds. They only purchase when farmers come to sell them, and if they don't come, they don't bother. I think this idea of ​​looking down on sporadic oil crops is wrong.

Recently, I went to work in the countryside and found a plant in the wilderness and on the edges of fields that has a high oil content. Some villagers call it "Qiangshizi," which means cocklebur seeds. I suggest that oil experts study whether it can be used as a raw material for oil extraction.

Editor's Note: According to the China Oils and Fats Company, Qiangshizi has an oil content of about 16% and an oil extraction rate of about 11%, and can be purchased for oil extraction. It has been notified to various places for trial extraction.

Suggestion to Mix Burning Crushed Coal for Heating

Letter from Wang Shuqing, Warehouse No. 1, Jilin Wholesale Station of China Department Store Company: In winter, coal consumption is very large for heating. A small number of units are only willing to burn good coal and whole coal, and are unwilling to burn inferior coal and crushed coal. As a result, after the good coal is burned, a lot of crushed coal is left over and sold at a low price, or discarded in the yard without being processed. Some comrades who burn boilers or fire walls keep burning regardless of whether the indoor temperature is high or low, which not only makes employees prone to catching colds but also wastes coal. In order to support industrial coal consumption, it is recommended that all units pay attention to mixing crushed coal to avoid waste.

专栏：来信摘要

    来信摘要
    对基层经济工作人员应注意审查和教育
    石志明等来信：反贪污斗争后，在河北省河间、盐山、吴桥等县的基层组织中仍不断发生新的贪污事件。犯有贪污行为的，百分之九十以上是营业员、会计、保管员。
    发生贪污的原因，首先是我们的国家机关和国营企业部门随着建设事业的发展，提拔了大批新的工作人员，这些人员绝大部分都没有经过“三反”运动的教育，而且有一些人本身就有资产阶级的剥削思想。其次，有些机关的领导人有着严重的官僚主义，对贪污盗窃行为失于警惕。甚至对已经发现的问题也熟视无睹，不加处理。有些部门的领导人只顾业务不问政治，只注意了商品的经营，而忽视了国家财产的保管和检查，因而给贪污分子以可乘之机。再次，有少数反革命分子，混入了国家机关和经济部门进行破坏。我认为这些问题应该引起各地注意。
    为什么发这样的“特急”电报
    读者田录来信：煤矿管理总局计划处决定在八月二十五日召开全国煤矿计划会议，七月底就把会议内容和参加人员通知了各煤矿管理局。八月中旬计划处召开预备会，临时决定要增添会议内容和准备会议资料，把会期延迟到九月一日。于是，他们赶紧拟了一个长达四千三百多字的通知，用“特急”电报发给各有关单位。由于写这个通知时对参加会议的人数没有考虑好，事后又发了一个“特急”电报去补正。发这两次电报，总共花了电报费一亿多元。
    在发电报以前，煤矿管理总局机要科曾提出意见：有些单位离北京较远，开会的人恐怕不等接到“特急”电报就动身了。事实上，当时西南区有的同志已经到北京了。计划处领导同志也知道这个情况，但是仍然指示要发电报，理由是：“开会的同志动身了，给他们单位的领导同志看看也好”。
    山西、陕西两省购棉机构还可精简
    中国花纱布公司晋南分公司王守伦来信：关于中国花纱布公司所属基层单位采购棉花机构重叠的问题，已得到部分解决。这个问题在六月二十八日人民日报发表后，由于总公司重视，以及山西、河南两省公司照顾了整体利益，原运城采购供应批发站驻灵宝、陕县的机构已经撤消。按九月份的业务情况共节省工资和经管费九百六十八万元，全年可以节约一亿一千六百一十六万元。我衷心感激党报对群众意见的支持。但遗憾的是，驻在陕西潼关的转运机构还没有得到解决。这个单位要比灵宝、陕县的机构大三倍，如能得到合理的解决，将会给国家节约更多的财富。希望总公司和山西、陕西两省公司继续研究解决这个问题。
    油料收购员的错误思想
    黑龙江省杨崇贺来信：黑龙江省某些基层供销合作社在收购油料作物中还存在一些问题：一、不少收购员认为零星油料作物不在计划收购之列，而放弃收购；二、对于产量较少的油料，不乐意收购，强调质量不好、零星、种类杂；甚至还有些供销合作社把已经从农民手里收购来的向日葵又零星地卖给私人零吃；三、对紫苏子、大麻、小麻子也不及时收购，农民来卖就收，不来拉倒。我认为这种瞧不起零星油料的思想是错误的。
    最近我下乡工作，在荒地中和田边发现一种植物，含油量很大，有些老乡叫它为“强食子”即苍耳籽，建议油料专家加以研究能不能作为榨油的原料。
    编者按：据中国油脂公司答称：强食子含油量约百分之十六，出油率约百分之十一，可以收购榨油。已通知各地收购试榨。
    建议掺烧碎煤取暖
    中国百货公司吉林批发站一库王树青来信：冬季取暖，煤的消耗很大。有少数单位只愿烧好煤、整煤，不愿烧次煤、碎煤，结果好煤烧完了，剩下了很多碎煤就低价出售，或者丢在院里不作处理了。有的烧锅炉或火墙的同志，不管室内温度高低，烧起就不止，既使职工容易感冒，又浪费了煤炭。为了支援工业用煤，建议各单位注意掺烧碎煤，以免浪费。
