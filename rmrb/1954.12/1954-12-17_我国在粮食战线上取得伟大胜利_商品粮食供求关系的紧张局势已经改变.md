Xinhua News Agency, 16th. After the summer and autumn of this year, everyone could see the great victory on our country's grain front. The tense situation in the supply and demand of commodity grain that appeared in the second half of 1953 has been changed due to the victorious implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. Even in the case of this year's once-in-a-century flood, this situation has been firmly stabilized.

The phenomenon of imbalance in the supply and demand of commodity grain in our country appeared after the total national grain output in 1952 exceeded the highest pre-war annual output by 9%. In the bumper harvest year, in the year 1952 (July) - 1953 (June), the state's grain sales increased by 84% compared with the previous year. At that time, the state's purchase plan was never completed monthly, and sales broke through the plan every month. This situation reflects the rapid increase in people's consumption levels. According to statistics, in 1952, the state-owned grain sales in eight cotton-producing areas, including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu, increased threefold compared with 1950. The varieties of sales have also changed. In 1950, state-owned grain institutions in Hebei Province sold 880,000 bags of flour, which reached more than 10 million bags in 1952. The proportion of fine grains (wheat, rice) sold in Beijing and Tianjin to the total sales of grain increased from 45% in 1950 to 70%. In the past few years, after the increase in grain production, farmers were not eager to sell their surplus grain. Farmers in Qingyuan County, a grain-producing area in Hebei Province, stored commodity grain accounting for one-quarter of the output, and 47% of farmers in Huangxinzhuang still had money to buy and store grain. More farmers were waiting and reluctant to sell in the grain market. After Henan and other places suffered frost damage last spring, the situation of supply and demand imbalance became tense. The market price of grain in major grain-producing areas such as Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, and Shaanxi was 3% to 30% or 50% higher than the listed price.

The nationwide publicity of the general task of the state during the transition period and the grain unified purchase and sale campaign launched in November 1953 was an unprecedented mass movement. According to incomplete statistics, 8.27 million Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, grass-roots cadres, and activists in eight provinces including Hebei, Shanxi, Liaodong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Guangxi, and Jiangxi widely carried out propaganda and education work among farmers after studying the general line. Under the call of "taking the socialist road," on the basis of improved awareness, the vast number of farmers who had supported the great War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation sold thousands of kilograms of surplus grain to the state to support industrial construction. Farmers in Yushu County, Jilin Province, had more than 300 million kilograms of old grain from 1952 when the unified purchase began. After being educated about the general task, farmers sold old grain to the state in batches. Mu Changli, a liberated farmer in Kuandian County, Liaoning Province, sold more than 10,000 kilograms of surplus grain accumulated for more than four years. Collective grain sales by farmers appeared in Shanxi, Hebei, and other places. Many farmers who originally planned to hoard grain, lend money, and buy land joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations after selling their grain. During the grain unified purchase and sale campaign, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives nationwide increased from more than 14,000 to more than 91,000, and more than 1.4 million farmers newly joined the cooperatives. The enthusiasm of farmers for production has been greatly improved, and farmers have invested a large amount of money from grain sales into production. When farmers sold a large amount of grain in January this year, the total value of production materials supplied to farmers by supply and marketing cooperatives nationwide increased by 94% compared with the same period last year.

In the first month of the grain unified purchase and sale campaign, the situation of purchasing less and selling more began to reverse. The amount of grain purchased by the state this month exceeded the highest level of grain purchases in previous years, an increase of 38% compared with the same period in 1952. After three or four months of the grain unified purchase and sale campaign, by the end of the 1953-1954 grain year, the state's annual grain purchase increased by 80% compared with the previous year, and sales increased by 33%, which reversed the serious supply and demand imbalance caused by sales exceeding purchases in the 1952-1953 grain year. A new situation has emerged on the grain front. Over the past year, the state has used more than one-third of the purchased grain to ensure the supply to more than 100 million grain-deficient farmers in rural areas, and the sales volume of grain in cities, industrial and mining areas has maintained a stable level. This situation has never occurred in the years when China imported more than 4 billion kilograms of grain in history. In June this year, the state's grain inventory increased by 50% compared with the same period last year. China's once-in-a-century flood occurred at this time. The people in the disaster areas knew from historical experience that "grain prices rise with the flood," and the flood was the time for grain merchants to stir up trouble. However, after the victory of the grain unified purchase and sale campaign, the grain merchants who continued to operate grain were already state consignment stores, those speculative grain merchants no longer existed, and the state had enough grain to supply the disaster areas, so it was able to absolutely stabilize grain prices. The staff of the grain department put forward the slogan "supply wherever people go," and thousands of grain ships sailed to the disaster areas. People said that this is a miracle in Chinese grain history. The stable situation of grain supply and demand has been tested during the flood period, which is a powerful answer to those who doubt that China's grain problem has a stable foundation. The person in charge of the Ministry of Food said to reporters that from the development of the current grain unified purchase and sale campaign being carried out nationwide, in the case of national grain output exceeding last year, this year's grain unified purchase can be completed or over-fulfilled according to the plan.

    我国在粮食战线上取得伟大胜利
    商品粮食供求关系的紧张局势已经改变
    【新华社十六日讯】在今年夏秋以后，谁都可以看见我国粮食战线上的伟大胜利了。一九五三年下半年，商品粮食供求关系上出现的紧张局势，已经由于粮食统购统销政策的胜利实施而得到了改变。就是在今年遇到百年未有的大水灾的情况下，这个局面也坚实地稳定住了。
    我国商品粮食供求失调的现象，出现在一九五二年全国粮食总产量超过战前最高年产量百分之九以后。在丰收的年度里，一九五二年（七月）—一九五三年（六月）的一年内，国家粮食销售量比上年度增加了百分之八十四，当时，国家收购月月完不成计划，销售月月突破计划。这种局势反映着人民消费水平的迅速提高。据统计：一九五二年河北、山东、河南、江苏等八个棉产区的国营粮食销售量比一九五零年增加了三倍。销售的品种也发生了变化。一九五零年河北省国营粮食机构销售面粉八十八万袋，一九五二年达到一千多万袋。北京、天津销售的细粮（小麦、大米）占全部销售粮食的比重都由一九五零年的百分之四十五增加到百分之七十。几年来，粮食增产后，农民不急于出售手中的余粮。河北省粮产区清苑县农民储存的商品粮占到产量的四分之一，黄信庄有百分之四十七的农民还有钱购粮存储。更多的农民在粮食市场上观望惜售。去年春天河南等地受霜灾后，这种供求失调的局势紧张起来了。湖南、江西、安徽、山东、河北、陕西等主要产粮区粮食市价高于牌价百分之三以至百分之三十、五十。
    一九五三年十一月在全国范围展开的国家在过渡时期总任务的宣传和粮食统购统销运动，是空前规模的群众性运动。据不完全统计，河北、山西、辽东、浙江、河南、湖北、广西、江西八个省有八百二十七万共产党员、青年团员和基层干部、积极分子，经过学习总路线后，广泛地向农民进行了宣传教育工作。在“走社会主义道路”的号召下，在觉悟提高的基础上，曾经支援了伟大抗日战争和解放战争的广大农民，把成千成万斤余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设。吉林省榆树县农民在统购开始时存有一九五二年的陈粮三亿多斤，农民在受到总任务教育以后，成批地把陈粮卖给国家。辽宁省宽甸县翻身农民穆长礼卖出了积存四年多的余粮一万多斤。山西、河北等地出现了农民集体卖粮的事例。许多原来打算囤粮、放债、买地的农民把粮食卖出后，参加了互助合作组织。在粮食统购统销运动期间，全国农业生产合作社由一万四千多个发展到九万一千多个，有一百四十多万户农民新加入了合作社。农民生产积极性大大提高了，农民把卖粮的钱大批投入生产。当今年一月农民大量卖粮时期，全国供销合作社供应农民生产资料的总值，比去年同期增加了百分之九十四。
    粮食统购统销运动展开的第一个月份，购少销多的局势就开始扭转。国家这个月份购粮数量超过了历年购粮数量的最高水平，比一九五二年同期增加了百分之三十八。粮食统购统销运动进行了三、四个月，到一九五三—一九五四粮食年度期末，国家全年度粮食收购量比上年度增加了百分之八十，销售增加了百分之三十三，一举改变了一九五二年至一九五三年粮食年度内销售大于收购所造成的严重供求失调现象。粮食战线上出现了一个新的局面。一年来，国家用三分之一以上的收购粮食，保证了对农村一亿多缺粮农民的供应，城市、工矿区粮食销售量保持着稳定的水平。这个局面就是在中国历史上进口粮食四十多亿斤的年份，也不曾出现过。今年六月，国家粮食库存比去年同期增加了百分之五十。我国百年未有的大水灾正是发生在这个时候。灾区人民从历史经验中知道，“粮价跟着水势涨”，水灾正是粮商兴风作浪的时机。但是，在粮食统购统销运动胜利以后，继续经营粮食的粮商已是国家代销店，那些投机倒把的粮商已不复存在，国家又有足够的粮食供应灾区，所以能够把粮价绝对稳定着。粮食部门职工提出“人到那里供应到那里”的口号，万千只粮船开到了灾区。人们说，这是中国粮食史上的奇迹。粮食供求稳定的局面，经受过水灾时期的考验，对怀疑我国粮食问题已有了稳定的基础的人，是个有力的回答。粮食部负责人对记者说，从今年全国正在进行的粮食统购统销运动的发展情况来看，在全国粮食产量超过去年的情况下，今年粮食统购可以按计划完成或超额完成。
