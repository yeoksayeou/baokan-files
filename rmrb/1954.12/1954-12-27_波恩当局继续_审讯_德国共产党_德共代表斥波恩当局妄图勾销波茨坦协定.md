Xinhua News Agency, December 24th, Bonn dispatch: The Bonn authorities are continuing their "trial" of the German Communist Party. The "trial" during this period focuses on the question of whether the Potsdam Agreement is valid for West Germany.

During the "trial," the Bonn government's representative actually stated in court that the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement are not valid for the Federal Republic. This absurd argument was sternly refuted by the legal representatives of the German Communist Party. The Communist Party representatives pointed out that, whether in the past or now, the Potsdam Agreement and the four-power supplementary agreement of 1945 are binding documents under international law, and the principles for democratizing Germany stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement are even more fundamental and cannot be abolished. A party that has consistently fought for the realization of the principles of the Potsdam Agreement cannot be considered illegal. The representatives of the German Communist Party emphasized that, to this day, no one has denied that Communists are the most resolute fighters against fascism.

During the trial, the German Communist Party representatives specifically pointed out that the German people must be able to freely decide on the question of their future constitution and the reunification of Germany through free all-German elections. The participation of the German Communist Party in such an election is necessary. The Bonn government's attempt to prevent the German Communist Party from participating in such an election shows that it wants to obstruct the German people from freely making decisions on the above issues.

    波恩当局继续“审讯”德国共产党
    德共代表斥波恩当局妄图勾销波茨坦协定
    【新华社二十四日讯】波恩消息：波恩当局还在继续“审讯”德国共产党。这一时期的“审讯”集中在波茨坦协定对于西德是否有效这个问题上。
    在“审讯”过程中，波恩政府的代表竟然在法庭上声明：波茨坦协定的各项条款对于联邦共和国没有效力。这种荒谬的论点受到了德国共产党法律代表的严正驳斥。共产党代表指出：不论是过去或者现在，波茨坦协定以及一九四五年四国的补充协议都是国际法中有约束力的文件，波茨坦协定规定的关于使德国民主化的原则更是不能废除的基础，一个一直为实现波茨坦协定的原则而奋斗的政党决不能被认为是非法的。德国共产党的代表着重指出：到现在为止，还没有人否认共产党人是反对法西斯主义的最坚决的战士。
    在审讯过程中，德国共产党代表特别指出：德国人民必须通过举行全德自由选举，才可能就他们未来的宪法的问题和重新统一德国的问题自由作出决定。德国共产党参加这样一次选举是必要的。波恩政府企图阻止德国共产党参加这样一次选举，表明它想阻挠德国人民就上述问题自由地作出决定。
