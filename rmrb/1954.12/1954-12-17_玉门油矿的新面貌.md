The Yumen Oilfield is currently the largest natural oilfield in our country. During our country's first Five-Year Plan period, it will become a powerful petroleum base for our country.

Before liberation, under the control of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, "Three Lines" petroleum was dumped in our country, and the production of the Yumen Oilfield was in a state of chronic stagnation. In addition to the chaotic management at the time, rudimentary equipment, and backward technology, although production was barely maintained, there was no scientific development plan, so that underground resources could not be rationally exploited. There were also no scientific management systems and protective measures for oil fields and oil wells, which greatly damaged the self-spraying capacity of the oil wells and seriously damaged the country's resources. Drilling equipment was especially pitiful, with only three small drilling rigs and some ancient percussion drills, capable of drilling only shallow wells within 1,000 meters, making it impossible to extract oil from the deep strata. Furthermore, because there was no anti-freeze and heat-preserving equipment and technology, there were six months of downtime each year. The small-scale refinery had only simple distillation equipment. Taking gasoline as the main product, the annual output was only tens of thousands of tons, and the quality was very low. The lives of the miners were even more miserable. Many workers were conscripted as forced laborers. They lived like prisoners, working all year round without enough food or clothing, and were threatened by disease, death, and the persecution of secret agents and military police.

After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, we carried out a series of reforms and received sincere and enthusiastic help from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic, which made Yumen Oilfield change its face day by day and achieved unprecedented great achievements. This is concentrated in the straight-line increase in the total value of production over the years and the large scale of capital construction. If the total value of production in 1950 is taken as the base number, then 1951 was 1.4 times; 1952 was 2.4 times, 1953 increased to 3.4 times, and 1954 is expected to increase to 4.3 times. The state's investment in capital construction in Yumen Oilfield this year is equivalent to 20.58 times that of 1950.

The development of petroleum geological work (including surface and underground geology) has provided us with the prerequisites for rapidly expanding Yumen's petroleum industry. We have now established a large-scale surface geological team with advanced scientific and technological equipment, including geological teams, seismic teams, gravity teams, surveying teams, and sand-eye teams. There is also an electrical surveying station that is responsible for underground geological work. These "vanguards" of the petroleum industry, born or grown up after liberation, are active throughout the Jiuquan Basin, enabling us to simultaneously drill and explore on many structures within a hundred kilometers around the Yumen Oilfield, and to find more new oilfields for the motherland. They also sent teams to support the development of the Qaidam Basin.

Thanks to the hard work of Soviet experts and the careful planning of geological workers, we have formulated a complete oilfield development plan that enables us to carry out regular mining. In the old Laojunmiao oilfield, we have newly discovered more than twice the underground oil storage area found before liberation. We found more than twice the reserves that were found before liberation. In order to remedy the lack of underground pressure caused by indiscriminate mining before liberation and to protect and prolong the life of the oilfield, we are building a brand-new artificial water injection project under the guidance of Soviet experts, preparing to use the injection of surface water to increase the driving capacity of groundwater, forcing as much underground oil as possible to self-spray out.

The development of drilling work in Yumen Oilfield has progressed even more rapidly. The total number of drilled footage in the five years after liberation is equivalent to 4.1 times the total number of drilled footage in the eleven years before liberation. The oil wells drilled this year alone would have taken six years to complete before liberation. Drilling personnel have earnestly studied the Soviet experience in rapid drilling and deep well drilling. Since last year, they have successively created six national drilling records. Recently, a certain oil well created a new record of 234.3 meters per day, and the monthly drilling speed of the drilling rig reached 1,293 meters. In order to support China's petroleum construction and impart advanced experience in drilling deep wells, the People's Republic of Romania has dispatched a well-equipped drilling team to help us drill the "Friendship Well." Currently, the first deep well in the country operated by Chinese workers themselves has been drilled to more than 2,800 meters.

Significant achievements have also been made in oil production. We have established a complete set of oilfield and oil well management systems and scientifically controlled the oil-gas ratio when oil wells are producing. This has completely eradicated the chaotic phenomenon of "relying on the weather" and blind exploitation that existed before liberation. In addition, we also carried out the revival of abandoned wells and universal well repair and wax removal work. All these efforts have greatly increased crude oil production. This year's planned output is 506.84 percent of the 1949 output.

In terms of oil refining, we completed the conversion of the Dabus cracking refinery at a speed unimaginable before liberation (four months), and successively carried out large-scale expansion and reconstruction work, and carried out a series of technical innovations. Only the realization of the suggestion of Youth League member Dai Yuru to install a secondary evaporation tower in the Dabus cracking refinery increased gasoline production by 8% to 10%, increasing the annual output value by more than 1.04 billion yuan, and improving the quality of gasoline. The creative labor of the refinery workers has increased gasoline production to 3.4 times that of 1949, and kerosene production to 4.5 times that of 1949. At the same time, many new products have been successfully trial-produced, such as various lubricating oils, various diesel oils, various asphalts, and various paraffin products. The quality of oil products is constantly improving, and the refining rate is also constantly improving. Unit costs are decreasing year by year.

On the basis of developing production, the material and cultural living standards of all mine workers have improved. In recent years, the mining area has built and developed libraries, cinemas, sanatoriums, rest homes, schools for workers' children, and sports facilities. The average wage of workers has exceeded 1.59 times that of 1950, and cultural demands are increasing. At present, the number of newspapers and magazines subscribed to by employees in the Laojunmiao mining area has reached about 10,000 copies. The cinemas with several screenings every day and the theaters with daily performances are crowded with audiences.

Now, people call the Yumen Oilfield a beautiful petroleum city, and it deserves it. It will continue to achieve greater development in drilling, oil production, capital construction, machinery repair, power generation, water supply, and mining area construction. The achievements of the past few years have made us firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party, with the assistance of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union, and with the efforts of comrades from the entire mine, the Yumen Oilfield will surely be built into the first powerful petroleum base of New China.

    玉门油矿的新面貌
    玉门矿务局局长　杨拯民
    玉门油矿是我国目前最大的一个天然油矿，在我国的第一个五年计划期中，它将成为我国强大的石油基地。
    解放前，在帝国主义和官僚资本的控制下，“三行”石油在我国倾销，玉门油矿的生产长期陷于不死不活状态。加之当时管理混乱，设备简陋，技术落后，生产虽然勉强维持着，但没有一个科学的开发方案，使地下资源不能得到合理开采。油田、油井也没有科学的管理制度和保护措施，大大损害了油井的自喷能力，严重破坏了国家的资源。钻井设备尤其可怜，只有三部小型钻机和一些古老的顿钻，仅能钻凿一千公尺以内的浅井，无法采出地层深处的石油。又因为没有防冻保温的设备和技术，一年便有六个月的停钻时间。规模狭小的炼厂，只有简单的蒸馏设备，以主要产品汽油来说，一年的产量不过几万吨，而且质量很低。矿工的生活更是悲惨，很多工人是被当作壮丁抓来的。他们过着囚犯似的生活，终年劳动，不得温饱，天天受着疾病、死亡的威胁，受着特务、宪警的迫害。
    解放后，我们在党和政府的正确领导下，进行了一系列的改革工作，并且得到了苏联、罗马尼亚、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国等兄弟国家真挚、热忱的帮助，使玉门油矿日新月异地改变着它的面貌，取得了前所未有的巨大成就。它集中表现在历年来生产总值的直线上升和基本建设的宏大规模上。生产总值若以一九五○年为基数，那末一九五一年即为一点四倍；一九五二年为二点四倍，一九五三年增长为三点四倍，一九五四年预计增长为四点三倍。国家今年对玉门油矿的基本建设投资，相当于一九五○年的二十点五八倍。
    石油地质工作（包括地面和地下地质）的开展，给我们迅速扩展玉门的石油事业提供了先决条件。我们现在已经建立了具有先进科学技术装备的庞大的包括地质队、地震队、重力队、测量队、钻井队、砂眼队等地面地质队伍，还有担任地下地质工作的电测站。这些解放后诞生或成长起来的石油工业的“尖兵”，活跃在整个酒泉盆地上，使我们目前能够在玉门油矿周围成百公里的范围内，在很多构造上同时打井钻探，为祖国寻找更多新的油田。他们还派遣了队伍去支援柴达木盆地的开发工作。
    由于苏联专家的辛勤指导，地质工作者的精心策划，我们制定出了完整的油田开发方案，使我们能够作到正规开采。我们在老君庙的老油田上，又新探出超过解放前所发现的地下储油面积一倍还多。寻找到了比解放前所查出的两倍还多的蕴藏量。为了补救解放前胡乱开采所造成的井下压力的不足，保护和延长油田寿命，我们又在苏联专家的指导下，建造着技术崭新的人工注水工程，准备利用地面水的注入，增加地下水的驱动能力，迫使地下的石油尽可能多的自喷出来。
    玉门油矿钻井工作的发展更是突飞猛进。解放后五年钻井进尺的总数，相当于解放前十一年钻井进尺总和的四点一倍。今年一年所钻凿的油井，在解放前要六年才能完成。钻井人员认真的学习了苏联快速钻进和打深井的经验，从去年起，先后创造了六次全国钻井纪录，最近某号油井又创造了日进二百三十四点三公尺的最高纪录，钻机月进速度达到一千二百九十三公尺。为了支援我国石油建设，传授钻凿深井的先进经验，罗马尼亚人民共和国派遣了一个配备完善的钻井工作队帮助我们开钻了
  “友谊之井”。目前我国工人自己操作的全国第一口深井，已钻到两千八百余公尺。
    在采油工作方面也获得了显著的成就。我们建立了整套的油田、油井管理制度，科学地控制了油井出油时的油气比例。这样就彻底革除了解放前那种“靠天吃饭”，盲目开采的混乱现象。另外，我们还进行了复活废井和普遍修井、清腊的工作。所有这些努力，使得原油产量大大提高，今年的计划产量为一九四九年产量的百分之五○六·八四。
    在炼油方面，我们以解放前想像不到的速度，
  （四个月的时间）完成了达布斯裂炼厂的改装，和接连两次进行了规模巨大的扩建、改建工作，并且进行了一连串的技术革新工作，仅青年团员戴玉如在达布斯裂炼厂安装二级蒸发塔的建议实现后，即提高了汽油产量百分之八到百分之十，每年增产价值达十亿四千余万元，并使汽油品质得到提高。炼油厂职工创造性的劳动，使汽油产量提高为一九四九年的三点四倍，煤油产量为一九四九年的四点五倍。同时，试制成功了很多新的产品，如各种润滑油，各种柴油，各种沥青和各种石腊产品，油品的质量在不断的改善，炼率也在不断的提高。单位成本在逐年下降。 
    在发展生产的基础上，全矿职工的物质文化生活水平提高了。几年来，矿区建设了和发展了图书馆、电影院、疗养院、休养所、职工子弟学校以及体育运动设备等。职工平均工资超过一九五○年一点五九倍，文化要求日益增长。目前老君庙矿区职工订阅的报刊杂志即达万份左右。每日数场的电影院和天天演出的剧院门口，观众们拥挤不堪。
    现在，人们称玉门油矿为美丽的石油城，它已当之无愧了。它将要继续在钻井、采油、基本建设、机修、发电、给水、矿区建设等方面，得到更大的发展。过去几年来的成就，使我们坚信：在党的正确领导下，在以苏联为首的兄弟国家的援助下，在全矿同志的努力下，玉门油矿必能建成为新中国第一个强大的石油基地。
