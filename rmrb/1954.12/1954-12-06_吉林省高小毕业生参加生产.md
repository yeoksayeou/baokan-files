    吉林省今年的高小毕业生已基本得到了妥善安置。
    全省今秋毕业的高小毕业生中，参加工业生产的有四千七百五十名，参加农业生产的有六万八千七百七十六名。
    参加农业生产的高小毕业生中，大多数都在互助合作组织里担负各种职务。如舒兰县参加农业生产的高小毕业生有三千八百九十二名，其中参加农业生产合作社和互助组的有三千七百八十九名。并有九名当了社主任，六十四名当了互助组长，一千七百八十九名担任会计和记账员，九百二十名当了生产队长和生产小组长。他们在生产中都表现了很高的劳动热情。成了生产中的一支生力军，对推进农业的社会主义改造和其他建设事业将起很大的作用。　（本报集体通讯员吉林日报编辑部）
