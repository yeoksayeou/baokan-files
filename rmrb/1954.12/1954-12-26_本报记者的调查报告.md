    Investigative Report by Our Newspaper Reporter
    To understand the safety production issues of quarry workers in the Zhangzhu area, our reporter interviewed responsible comrades from the relevant local leadership organs. Everyone acknowledged the serious situation of worker deaths and injuries as a fact; however, they all considered it unavoidable. Liu Yuanxing, Deputy Secretary of the Zhangzhu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said when discussing this issue: "With such backward and disorganized production methods, what can be done to prevent deaths!" Zhu Yunjin, the Party Branch Secretary of Zhangzhu Town, and Lu Rulin, the Chairman of the Trade Union, said that this issue had long been reported to the county and criticized by the Jiangsu Xinhua Daily, but they just couldn't figure out a solution.
    In the Zhangzhu area, there are twelve villages, with nearly a thousand workers engaged in quarry production. In the early days of liberation, a quarry workers' union was once organized, but after 1952, the union was abolished. Quarry workers have neither a unified organization nor an organ responsible for leadership. They use yellow letter-tube explosives, which are very powerful; however, production still relies on methods from over a hundred years ago, making accidents very likely.
    The Yixing County and Zhangzhu District People's Governments and trade union organizations indeed hold a somewhat indifferent attitude towards worker deaths and injuries. They only vaguely know that deaths and injuries are serious, but no department can specifically explain how many people have died or been injured in the Zhangzhu area, or what caused the deaths and injuries.
    According to the reporter's understanding: there are also many quarry workers who have never had accidents, such as veteran worker Tao Landa, who has one or two decades of quarrying history. He is not only proficient in general drilling and blasting techniques, but also understands the texture and properties of the stone. He has never had any accidents in production. If the leadership organs organize the workers through appropriate methods, strengthen ideological education, and at the same time carry out technological reforms and disseminate advanced experience, casualties can be greatly reduced.
    Due to the leadership's indifferent attitude towards worker deaths and injuries, many workers have serious negative and pessimistic sentiments. They say: "Just eat and drink, and take it one day at a time. Who knows if you'll come back down the mountain after going up!" Li A'da and four other quarry workers even pooled money to hire a boat to Shanghai for five days. They said: "What you eat and play is your own. You can't be sure when something bad will happen." Some workers go to the tavern to drink as soon as they come down the mountain, getting completely drunk.
    The above situation has been reported to the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Labor Bureau by Jiangsu Xinhua Daily and township cadres in the quarry area, requesting them to handle it properly; however, the Labor Bureau has not seriously studied and resolved the problem, and the issued official documents simply went on a journey and that was the end of it. The Jiangsu Provincial People's Government should urge the relevant leading organs of Yixing County to solve this problem quickly.

    本报记者的调查报告
    为了了解张渚地区采石工人的安全生产问题，记者访问了当地有关领导机关的负责同志。对于采石工人死伤事故的严重情况，大家都说是事实；但是，他们都认为是无法避免的。中共张渚区区委副书记刘元兴同志谈到这个问题的时候说：“落后的散漫的生产方式，有什么办法可以不死人哩！”张渚镇的党支部书记朱云锦同志和工会主席陆如林同志说，这个问题早已向县里汇报过了，江苏新华日报也批评过，可是就是想不出解决办法。
    张渚地区有十二个村，参加采石生产的工人近千人，解放初期，一度组织过采石工会，一九五二年以后，又把工会撤销了。采石工人既没有一个统一的组织，也没有一个机关负责领导。他们采用的是黄色信管炸药，威力很大；而生产还是用一百多年前的老方法，因此很容易发生事故。
    宜兴县和张渚区的人民政府和工会组织对于工人死伤事故确实抱着一种不很关心的态度，他们只是笼统地知道死伤事故严重，至于在张渚地区究竟死伤了多少人，什么原因造成了死伤事故，却没有
  一个部门能够具体地说明。
    据记者了解：采石工人中一向没有发生事故的也不少，如老工人陶兰大，已有一、二十年的采石历史，不但熟谙一般的钻孔放炮技术，而且还懂得山石的纹路和性能，在生产中从来没有发生任何事故。如果领导机关通过适当方式把工人组织起来，加强思想教育，同时进行技术改革和传播先进经验，伤亡事故是可以大大减少的。
    由于领导方面对采石工人的人身伤亡事故采取不问不理的态度，不少的工人存在着严重的消极悲观情绪。他们说：“有吃有喝，过一天算一天罢了，谁知道上得山去还下不下得来哩！”李阿大等五个采石工人就曾集资雇了一只船到上海去玩了五天，他们说：“吃了玩了是自己的，那一天来个三长两短也保不准。”有的工人一下山就上酒馆喝酒，喝得醉熏熏的。
    上述情况，江苏新华日报和采石地区的乡干部曾经先后向江苏省人民政府劳动局反映过，要求他们加以妥善的处理；劳动局却没有认真地去研究和解决，只是让发出的公文旅行了一趟就完了。江苏省人民政府应该督促宜兴县有关领导机关迅速解决这个问题。
