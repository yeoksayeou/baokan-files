    The so-called "mutual defense treaty" recently signed by the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a criminal treaty attempting to incite a new war and an extremely shameless treaty of national betrayal. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on this treaty issued on December 8 powerfully exposed its criminal purpose, once again proclaimed our country's solemn position, and the determination of our people to oppose war, defend peace, and liberate Taiwan. We, all literary and art workers, enthusiastically support this statement. Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory. Whoever wants to seize our country's territory, infringe upon our country's sovereignty, and interfere in our country's internal affairs will be resolutely opposed by our people.
    We literary and art workers have always loved the motherland, loved peace, and hated wars of aggression. Now, faced with this serious war provocation against our country by American imperialism, we can only more bravely raise the weapons of literature and art, and together with all the Chinese people, make redoubled efforts to liberate Taiwan as soon as possible and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We will never give up until we achieve our goal! (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国文学艺术界联合会负责人的谈话
    最近美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国贼签订的所谓“共同防御条约”，是一个企图掀起新的战争的罪恶条约，也是一个极其无耻的卖国条约。周恩来外交部长十二月八日发表的关于这个条约的声明，有力地揭露了它的罪恶目的，再一次宣告了我国的严正立场，以及我国人民反对战争、保卫和平、一定要解放台湾的决心。我们全体文学艺术工作者热烈地拥护这个声明。台湾是中国神圣领土的一部分，谁想要霸占我国的领土，侵犯我国的主权，干涉我国的内政，谁就要遭受到我国人民的坚决反对。
    我们文学艺术工作者，素来是热爱祖国，热爱和平，痛恨侵略战争的。现在面临着美帝国主义对我国这一严重的战争挑衅，我们只有更英勇地举起文学艺术的武器来，同全中国人民一起，为早日解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团而作加倍的努力。不达目的，决不罢休！　（新华社）
