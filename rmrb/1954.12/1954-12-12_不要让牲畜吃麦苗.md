    Don't Let Livestock Eat Wheat Seedlings
    To the Editor:
    On November 19th, on my way back to the station after finishing work in Qinghe Village, I found many cattle, donkeys, pigs, etc. eating wheat seedlings in the wheat fields. Some wheat had been eaten bare in patches. According to my understanding, farmers throughout the Huaibei area have a habit of "releasing livestock and scattering pigs and sheep after planting wheat," thinking that it doesn't matter if the wheat is eaten a little, as it will still sprout in the spring. In fact, this practice is very harmful to the normal growth of wheat and will affect next year's wheat yield. I hope that areas with this situation will quickly educate farmers not to let livestock roam freely.

    不要让牲畜吃麦苗编辑同志：
    十一月十九日我从清河村作业结束回站走在路上发现不少的牛、驴、猪等在麦田里吃麦苗子，有的麦子已被成片的吃光。据我了解，整个淮北地区农民都有“种完麦子放牲口、散猪羊”的习惯，认为麦子吃点没啥，明春还能发棵子。其实这种作法对小麦的正常生长很有妨害，将影响明年小麦的产量。希望有这种情况的地区赶快教育农民不要散放牲畜。
