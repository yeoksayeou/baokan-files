    The Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of Textile Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives jointly convened the National Silkworm Cocoon and Silk Conference last month to study and determine the policy and tasks for developing silk production.
    The conference first studied the current development of China's silk industry. Since liberation, China's silk production has increased year by year. It is estimated that the silkworm cocoon production in 1954 increased by 73 percent compared with 1950. The output of filature silk and silk fabrics in 1954 increased by about 100 percent compared with 1950. At present, 30 percent of silkworm farmers have been organized. The state purchases 70 percent of the silkworm cocoon production. The state basically processes and purchases all the filature silk and silk fabrics nationwide. The state-owned sector accounts for 95 percent of the total sales value of silk both domestically and abroad. In the past five years, the total value of silk exports from China can be exchanged for 1.8 million tons of steel, or it can be exchanged for the steel rails to lay four and a half railways from Manchuria to Guangzhou, which has played a certain role in promoting the country's socialist industrialization.
    The conference pointed out that although China's silk industry has developed since liberation, it still cannot keep up with the needs of domestic and foreign markets. The main reason why silk production cannot increase rapidly at present is that it suffered too heavily from the devastation of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, the mulberry garden area has been greatly reduced, and the production of mulberry leaves is very insufficient, so the total output of silkworm cocoons cannot be increased rapidly. Therefore, it has caused the phenomenon that silk reeling equipment cannot be fully utilized. The utilization rate of existing silk reeling equipment in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is only 70 percent, and silk reeling factories in Guangdong generally can only operate for half a year.
    The conference believes that most areas in China are suitable for planting mulberry trees and raising silkworms. Generally, silkworms can be raised twice a year, and seven or eight times a year in eastern Guangdong and Guangxi. The vast majority of farmers also have the habit and experience of raising silkworms. Therefore, China has superior conditions for developing silk production. At the same time, because the export value of silk is very high, increasing silk exports is of great significance to supporting the country's socialist industrialization. As people's living standards improve, the demand for silk is also increasing year by year, so we must strive to develop silk production. Based on the above situation, the conference determined the policy of vigorously developing silk production, requiring a return to the pre-war peak production level in 1962; and specifically determined the plan for 1955: to cultivate 730 million mulberry seedlings, and to increase the production of silkworm cocoons by 11.36 percent compared with 1954. The production of filature silk and silk fabrics is also required to increase by more than 11 percent compared with 1954. In 1955, the state will issue a large number of silkworm eggs to support the silkworm breeding industry.
    In order to complete the silk production plan for 1955 and beyond, the conference believes that all localities must vigorously develop mutual aid and cooperation in mulberry and silkworm production, consolidate and expand the area of mulberry gardens, and increase the yield per unit area of mulberry gardens. In key silk-producing areas, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong, the digging and cutting of mulberry trees should be stopped immediately. Farmers who plant mulberry trees but do not raise silkworms should be mobilized to raise silkworms. In mountainous and hilly areas, new mulberry-growing areas should be vigorously developed. Attention should be paid to the experimental research on silkworm and mulberry varieties, and excellent varieties should be cultivated. In order to increase silk production, all localities must also improve production technology, make full use of existing equipment, and build new factories in a planned way. In the future, we should continue to expand foreign sales and appropriately supply domestic sales; correspondingly, we should train the technical personnel needed in the silk industry in industry, agriculture, trade, and cooperation, and gradually implement the socialist transformation of individual silk weaving households, private silkworm seed farms, and silk industrial and commercial enterprises.

    全国桑蚕蚕丝会议确定大力发展蚕丝生产的方针
    【本报讯】对外贸易部、纺织工业部、农业部和中华全国供销合作总社，上月联合召开了全国桑蚕蚕丝会议，研究并确定了发展蚕丝生产的方针任务。
    会议首先研究了我国蚕丝业目前的发展情况。解放以后，我国蚕丝生产逐年增加，一九五四年所产蚕茧估计比一九五○年增加百分之七十三，厂丝、厂绸的产量，一九五四年比一九五○年提高约一倍。目前百分之三十的养蚕农民已组织起来。国家收购蚕茧占产量的百分之七十。全国厂丝、厂绸已基本上由国家加工和收购。丝绸内外销售总值中，国营的经营额占百分之九十五。五年来我国出口丝绸总值，可换回一百八十万吨钢材，或可换回铺设从满洲里到广州四条半铁路的钢轨，对促进国家社会主义工业化起了一定作用。
    会议指出，我国蚕丝事业虽然在解放后有发展，但是仍赶不上国内外市场的需要。目前蚕丝生产不能迅速增长的主要原因，是过去受日本帝国主义和国民党反动派的摧残过重，桑园面积大大缩减，桑叶生产十分不足，蚕茧的总产量不能迅速增加。因此，造成了缫丝设备不能充分利用的现象，江苏、浙江地区现有缫丝设备的利用率只达到百分之七十，广东缫丝厂一般只能开工半年。
    会议认为，我国绝大部分地区都适宜栽桑养蚕，一般每年可养蚕两次，广东、广西的东部可养七、八次；广大农民也都有养蚕的习惯和经验，所以，我国具有发展蚕丝生产的优越条件。同时，由于丝绸出口的价值很高，增加丝绸出口，对支援国家社会主义工业化有重大意义；人民生活水平提高以后，对丝绸的需要也在逐年增加，因此必须努力发展蚕丝生产。会议根据以上情况，确定了大力发展蚕丝生产的方针，要求在一九六二年恢复到战前最高生产水平；并具体确定了一九五五年的计划：培育桑苗七亿三千万株，生产的蚕茧要求比一九五四年增加百分之十一点三六，厂丝、厂绸的生产也要求比一九五四年增加百分之十一多。一九五五年，国家将大量发放蚕种，以扶助养蚕业。
    为了完成一九五五年和今后蚕丝生产的计划，会议认为，各地必须大量发展蚕桑生产互助合作，巩固和扩大桑园面积，提高桑园的单位面积产量。在重点产蚕丝的地区，如江苏、浙江、广东等地，应迅速制止挖桑、砍桑。对种桑而未养蚕的农民，应该发动他们养蚕。在山区和丘陵地带，应大力开拓新桑区。注意对蚕桑品种的试验研究，培育优良品种。为了增加丝绸生产，各地还必须改进生产技术，充分利用现有设备，并有计划地建设新厂。今后应该继续扩大外销，适当供应内销；相应地培养在蚕丝事业中所需要的工、农、贸易、合作等方面的技术干部，逐步实行对个体丝织机户、私营蚕种场和丝绸工商业的社会主义改造。
