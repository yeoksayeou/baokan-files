    Our Country's Trade Union Sanatorium and Recuperation Work
    Li Guochao
    In recent years, with the implementation of labor insurance, the trade union's sanatoriums and rest homes have reached a total of 164, including those under construction, with more than 21,000 beds. In addition, grassroots trade unions have established more than 1,000 amateur sanatoriums, with more than 30,000 beds. In the past few years, more than 800,000 employees have received recuperation in sanatoriums and rest homes. The development of sanatoriums has played a certain role in reducing the disease rate of employees, restoring and improving their physical health, and enhancing their political awareness and production enthusiasm.
    Many of the sanatoriums and rest homes run by trade unions are located in scenic areas. From the capital, Beijing, it only takes more than eight hours by train to reach the Beidaihe seaside scenic area. The Beidaihe seaside area faces the sea on the east and south sides, and is covered with lush trees. Sanatoriums and rest homes can be found everywhere along the 20-li coastline from East Mountain to West Mountain. The trade union system runs a total of twelve sanatoriums and rest homes in the Beidaihe seaside area. Among them, the Coal Miners' Sanatorium was one of the first established by the trade union in this recuperation area. Now it has six beautiful buildings with 500 beds for recuperation and treatment. More than 4,000 employees have received recuperation and treatment here this year.
    Qingdao is also a recuperation area in our country with a relatively large concentration of sanatoriums and rest homes. The trade union system runs a total of seven sanatoriums and rest homes here. Among them, the Qingdao Municipal Trade Union Workers' Sanatorium, the Textile Workers' Sanatorium, and the Second Machinery Trade Union Workers' Sanatorium are all newly built. The Textile Trade Union Workers' Sanatorium is built on the seashore, and thousands of textile workers come here every year for recuperation and treatment. Most of them are female employees, and they lead extremely comfortable and pleasant lives here.
    Hangzhou's West Lake, a world-famous scenic spot, also has sanatoriums and rest homes run by our country's trade unions, including the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Rest Home, the Railway Trade Union Workers' Sanatorium, the Posts and Telecommunications Trade Union Sanatorium, and the Seamen's Trade Union Workers' Rest Home, etc., a total of six units. Many employees come here every year for recuperation and treatment.
    In addition, scenic spots such as the beautiful Lushan Mountain, the Northeast's Qianshan Mountain, known for its hot springs, and the coastal city of Dalian have now established and are building sanatoriums and rest homes for employees.
    Among the existing 122 sanatoriums (excluding those built in 1954 and those that have recently opened), there are eight hot spring sanatoriums, twenty-seven tuberculosis sanatoriums, and fifty-five general sanatoriums.
    Hot spring sanatoriums mainly use mineral springs and other effective medical methods, such as massage, acupuncture, and medicine, to treat chronic patients with rheumatic arthritis, skin diseases, urinary system diseases, etc. For example, the Xingcheng Hot Spring Sanatorium of the Railway Trade Union and the Northeast Workers' Hot Spring Sanatorium in Qianshan Mountain, Northeast China, and the Benxi Workers' Hot Spring Sanatorium have an effective rate of over 90% in treating rheumatic arthritis.
    Tuberculosis sanatoriums are specifically for admitting employees suffering from tuberculosis for recuperation. Generally, they admit patients with milder conditions, or those who have been treated in hospitals for a period of time and whose conditions are relatively stable before being transferred to sanatoriums for recuperation. At present, various tuberculosis sanatoriums are learning and promoting various advanced Soviet therapies, such as sports therapy, and have achieved good results.
    General sanatoriums mainly admit employees suffering from digestive system diseases, nervous system diseases, blood circulation system diseases, and motor organ diseases. In our sanatoriums, many general sanatoriums have the necessary medical equipment, and some sanatoriums are quite well-equipped, such as ultraviolet, infrared, and hot wire lamps, and hot air baths for light therapy. For electrotherapy, there are ultra-short waves, medium waves, flat-flow induction, resonant sparks, and various X-ray machines. For hydrotherapy, there are general sitz baths, medicinal sitz baths, showers, gas sitz baths, four-tank baths, sulfur baths, and seawater baths. In addition, there are mud therapy and wax therapy. We attach great importance to learning and promoting the advanced medicine and various advanced medical methods of the Soviet Union, enriching and utilizing these medical equipment, and carrying out physical therapy, and have achieved obvious results and improved the efficiency of recuperation.
    Employees who come to sanatoriums for recuperation enjoy various preferential treatments in accordance with labor insurance benefits. For example, the recuperator only pays up to one-half of the food expenses, and many people pay only one-third due to various difficulties, and the rest is directly subsidized from the grassroots labor insurance fund. All travel expenses are borne by the enterprise administration or the employer for those injured on the job. For other employees, if the distance exceeds 50 kilometers, the individual pays up to one-half of the travel expenses. If there are difficulties, the subsidy can be increased according to the specific situation of each person, and these expenses are also allocated from the grassroots labor insurance fund. The salary during the recuperation period is paid by the enterprise administration or the labor insurance fund at the rate stipulated in the labor insurance regulations as their sick leave salary or sick relief fund. As for medical expenses, surgical fees, and hospitalization fees in the sanatorium, all are not borne by the individual. In sanatoriums, according to labor insurance regulations, labor models and combat heroes who have been transferred to work in enterprises enjoy particularly preferential treatment. They not only have priority in entering sanatoriums for recuperation, but also all travel expenses are borne by the enterprise administration, and their salaries are paid in full during the recuperation period. Here, they receive special respect and warm care from the people.
    Trade union-run rest homes mainly accommodated labor models from various places for recuperation in the past, for a period of twelve days to two weeks. Especially from May to September every year, tens of thousands of employees come to the scenic, cool, and comfortable trade union rest homes to spend the summer. The employees resting in the Beidaihe Rest Home live like this every day: radio exercises and beach walks in the morning, organized excursions in the morning, and various activities organized in the rest home: singing, dancing, table tennis, basketball, and chess friendly matches. There is also a short period of reading newspapers every day. After a nap in the afternoon, they go to the sea for seawater bathing, and after a short rest, some read newspapers and picture magazines, and some go to the club to play. Sometimes, production experience exchange meetings are also organized, each lasting half an hour to an hour, four or five times per period. Sometimes, combat heroes of the People's Liberation Army are invited to report on heroic deeds. The cultural and recreational activities in the evening, although not long, are very lively, sometimes watching movies, sometimes organizing parties or dances, and resting at 9:30 in the evening. The day is spent in such a pleasant life.
    Although the number of sanatoriums and rest homes of the trade unions in New China has increased greatly in recent years, the existing number is far from meeting the growing material and cultural needs of the working people. Therefore, during the period of the country's first five-year economic construction plan, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has formulated a five-year construction plan for the sanatorium undertaking of considerable scale. In the second year of this plan (i.e., 1954), the funds invested in basic construction are more than 240 billion yuan. Including cross-year projects, a total of 42 units with more than 6,000 beds are currently under construction this year (all the above figures do not include the figures of grassroots sanatoriums). Therefore, when the first five-year plan is completed, the cause of employee recuperation and rest will be further developed. More sanatoriums and rest homes will be built throughout the motherland to fully receive our country's workers.

    我国工会的疗养事业
    李国超
    几年来，随着劳动保险的实施，工会的疗养院和休养所，到目前为止，连正在建设中的在内，已共有一百六十四所，二万一千多个床位。此外基层工会举办的业余疗养所，还有一千多处，三万多个床位。几年来在疗养院、休养所疗养过的职工已达八十多万人。疗养所的发展，对降低职工的疾病率，恢复和增进职工的身体健康，提高职工的政治觉悟和生产积极性，起了一定作用。
    工会举办的疗养院和休养所，很多都设在风景优美的地区。从首都——北京出发，只要乘八个多钟头的火车，就可以到达北戴河海滨风景区。北戴河海滨区东、南两面临海，树木茂盛，从东山到西山二十里长的海滨上，到处都是疗养院和休养所。北戴河海滨区由工会系统举办的疗养院和休养所，一共有十二所。其中煤矿工人疗养院是工会在这个疗养区最早建立的一个，现在它有六座美丽的楼房，拥有五百个休养和疗养的床位，今年在这里休养和疗养的职工有四千多人。
    青岛也是我国集中了较多的疗养院和休养所的一个疗养区，在这里工会系统举办的疗养院和休养所共有七个，其中青岛市工会工人疗养院、纺织工人疗养院和第二机械工会工人疗养院都是新建筑的。纺织工会工人疗养院建筑在海滨上，每年都有数千的纺织工人到这里来休养和疗养，大多数都是女职工们，她们在这里过着极为舒适愉快的生活。
    全世界闻名的风景区杭州西湖，也有我国工会举办的疗养院和休养所，其中有上海市总工会休养所、铁路工会工人疗养院、邮电工会疗养院、海员工会工人休养所等六个单位，每年都有很多的职工到这里来休养与疗养。
    此外如风景幽美的国内名胜庐山，以温泉著称的东北千山，海滨城市大连等风景区，现在都设立了和正在建筑着供职工们使用的疗养院和休养所。
    在现有的一百二十二所疗养院中（不包括一九五四年修建和最近开幕的），有温泉疗养院八所，肺结核疗养院二十七所，一般性疗养院五十五所。
    温泉疗养院主要是利用矿泉和其他有效的医疗方法，如按摩、针灸、药物等，对患有风湿性关节炎、皮肤疾病、泌尿系疾病等慢性病人进行治疗。如铁路工会兴城温泉疗养院，东北千山东北工人温泉疗养院，本溪工人温泉疗养院，对治疗风湿性关节炎的有效率都在百分之九十以上。
    肺结核疗养院是专门收容患有肺结核的职工来疗养的，一般的都是收容较轻的病人，或者在医院治疗一个时期，病情较稳定后转入疗养院来疗养。目前各个肺结核疗养院在学习和推广苏联各种先进疗法，如体育疗法等，收到了良好的效果。
    一般性的疗养院，主要是收容患有消化系统疾病，神经系统疾病，血液循环系统疾病，运动器官疾病的职工。在我们的疗养院中，一般性的疗养院许多都有必要的医疗设备，有些疗养院设备相当齐全，如光疗中的紫外线、红外线、热线灯、热气浴等。电疗中的超短波、中超，平流感应，共鸣火花，各种X光机等。水疗中的一般盆浴、药物盆浴、淋浴、气体盆浴、四槽浴、硫磺浴、海水浴等。另外还有泥疗、蜡疗等。我们学习和推广了苏联的先进医学和各种先进医疗方法，对充实和运用这些医疗设备，进行物理治疗，都极为重视，并收到了明显的效果，提高了疗养效率。
    来疗养院疗养的职工，都按照劳动保险待遇，享受着各种优厚的照顾。例如疗养员的伙食费本人最多只出二分之一，有许多人因有各种困难，只出三分之一，其余都由基层劳动保险基金中直接补助。来往的路费，凡系因工负伤的，全部由企业行政或资方负担。其他职工，超过五十公里以上的，本人最多只出二分之一的路费，有困难的，根据各人的具体情况可提高补助，这些经费同样由基层劳动保险基金中拨用。疗养期间的工资，按照劳动保险条例规定的比例，由企业行政或劳动保险基金中发给其病伤假期工资或病伤救济费。至于疗养院中的医药费、手术费、住院费等，全部都不需要本人负担。在疗养院里，按劳动保险条例规定，劳动模范和转入企业工作的战斗英雄，享受有特别优越的待遇，他们不仅享有进入疗养院疗养的优先权，同时来往的路费全由企业行政负担，疗养期间的工资百分之百地照发，在这里，他们受到人们的特别尊重和亲热的关怀。
    工会办的休养所，过去主要是收容各地的劳动模范来休养，每期十二天到两个星期。特别是每年的五月到九月间，有数以万计的职工们到风景优美、气候清凉、起居舒适的工会休养所里来度过夏天。在北戴河休养所里休养的职工们一天是这样生活的：早晨作广播体操和海滩散步，上午组织远游，在休养所里组织各种活动：教歌，教舞，乒乓球、篮球、象棋友谊比赛等。每天还有一个短时间读报。下午午睡后，下海去进行海水浴，回来作短时间休息后，有的去看报纸画报，有的到俱乐部去玩。有时也组织生产经验交流会，每次半个钟头到一个钟头，每期四、五次。有时还请解放军的战斗英雄报告英雄事迹。晚上的文化娱乐活动，虽然时间并不长，却很热闹，有时是看电影，有时是组织联欢或舞会，到晚上九点半休息。一天就在这样愉快的生活中渡过去。
    新中国工会的疗养院和休养所几年来虽然已有很大的增加，但现有的数量还远不能适应劳动人民日益增长着的物质文化生活的要求，因此在国家实行第一个五年经济建设计划时期中，中华全国总工会已制定了规模相当大的疗养事业的五年建设计划。这个计划的第二年（即一九五四年），投资在基本建设方面的经费，就有二千四百多亿元，如包括跨年度工程在内，今年正在施工的一共有四十二个单位，六千多个床位（以上所有数字都不包括基层的疗养所数字），因此当第一个五年计划完成后，职工疗养和休养的事业将获得进一步的发展。在祖国各地必将建设起更多的疗养院和休养所，充分地接待我国的工人。
