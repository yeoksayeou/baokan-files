    The friendly visit of Burmese Prime Minister U Nu to our country has been met with importance and warm welcome by the people of our country. Prime Minister U Nu contacted representatives from all walks of life in our country and exchanged views extensively with our national leaders on matters of common concern to both countries. The joint communiqué of the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and Burma, issued on December 12, specifically demonstrates the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, setting another example for peaceful coexistence among Asian countries based on the Five Principles. The continuous enhancement of friendly and cooperative relations between China and Burma is of great significance for maintaining peace in Asia and the world.
    The joint communiqué of the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and Burma reaffirms the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence affirmed in the joint statement of the two Prime Ministers on June 29 this year, and provides favorable conditions for further developing the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries in the future. This once again proves eloquently to the world that countries with different social systems and different ideologies can coexist peacefully. Prime Minister U Nu also said at the banquet hosted by our Premier Zhou Enlai on December 2: "These five principles of peace are very important not only to our two countries but also to world peace. Whether in terms of practical benefits or justice, these five principles are appropriate guiding principles for all countries."
    As pointed out in the joint communiqué, the Prime Ministers of China and Burma believe that it is appropriate to promote economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, economic and cultural exchanges between the people of China and Burma have developed considerably; the two countries have sent trade delegations and cultural delegations to each other, which have played a significant role in promoting the economic and cultural development between the two countries. The Sino-Burmese trade agreement and the barter protocol signed by the government delegations of China and Burma in Rangoon in April and Beijing in November this year are good examples. In order to further develop trade relations between China and Burma, the Prime Ministers of the two countries agreed in the joint communiqué that China would purchase 150,000 to 200,000 tons of rice from Burma each year for the three years from 1955 to 1957; Burma would purchase industrial equipment, industrial materials and daily necessities that China could supply. This foreshadows the expansion of trade relations between China and Burma on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In order to meet the needs of such economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, the Prime Ministers of the two countries believe that it is necessary to establish consulates general in appropriate cities of the two countries, prepare to open air routes between China and Burma, restore road traffic between China and Burma, and conclude postal and telecommunications agreements between the two countries. There is no doubt that these measures will further promote economic and cultural exchanges between our two countries, which will be beneficial to the people of both countries in improving their living conditions and building their countries.
    The Prime Ministers of the two countries also held extremely friendly discussions on the issue of the nationality of overseas Chinese between China and Burma and the issue of the undemarcated border between the two countries. The Prime Ministers of the two countries agreed that the two governments will seek a solution to these two issues through normal diplomatic channels at an appropriate time. The communiqué stated: "The Prime Ministers of the two countries agreed to encourage the overseas Chinese in their respective countries, namely, the Burmese overseas Chinese residing in China and the Chinese overseas Chinese residing in Burma, to respect the laws and social customs of the host country and not to participate in the political activities of the host country. The two governments are willing to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese from the other country." Since China and Burma are close neighbors and the people of the two countries have a long history of friendly exchanges, the mutual residence of the people of the two countries is inevitable. The agreement between the Prime Ministers of the two countries on improving the mutual residence situation of the people of the two countries not only reflects the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference in each other's internal affairs and conforms to the interests of the governments and people of the two countries; it also mutually guarantees the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese from the other country, which is also in line with the vital interests of each other's overseas Chinese.
    The joint communiqué of the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and Burma expressed the close concern of the two Prime Ministers for the consolidation and expansion of the peace zone. This is because both of our countries are peace-loving and need to strive for a peaceful international environment to build their countries. Everyone knows that after the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina, international tensions have eased. However, the US aggression bloc does not welcome the restoration of peace in Indochina, does not welcome the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and does not welcome the establishment of a peace zone. In September of this year, it pieced together the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group," the purpose of which is to undermine the Geneva Conference agreements, create divisions in Asia, antagonize the People's Republic of China, and interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries. As Prime Minister U Nu pointed out in his speech at the Meimiao Military Officers' Annual Conference, the formation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization "increased the chances of a Third World War."
    At present, ensuring the implementation of the Geneva Conference agreements, consolidating peace in Indochina, and stabilizing the situation in Southeast Asia are of pressing importance. Our government and people resolutely fulfill the obligations under the Geneva Conference agreements and support the efforts of Burma, India and other Colombo Conference countries in this regard.
    The Chinese people fully agree with the joint communiqué of the meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and Burma which points out that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can and should be widely adopted by Asian and world countries; all countries should enjoy the rights to national independence and prosperous life without foreign interference and foreign aggression. The Chinese people will never threaten or invade others, and resolutely oppose anyone's threat and aggression against us. The Chinese people eagerly demand peace, but will never beg for peace at the expense of their territory and sovereignty. Sacrificing territorial sovereignty can only lead to further aggression and will never achieve true peace. The Chinese people understand that only by resisting aggression can we defend peace.
    The "Common Defense Treaty" signed by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group is an undisguised war treaty by the United States to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu, interfere in China's internal affairs, and prepare to launch a large-scale armed attack on China. This act of aggression by the United States completely violates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and attempts to impose war on the Chinese people. Therefore, as the Chinese people have repeatedly warned, the US government must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising therefrom.
    The Chinese people firmly believe that as long as all peace-loving countries and people in Asia and the world strengthen their unity, defeat all war threats and provocative conspiracies of the US aggressors, they can continuously expand the peace zone and ensure world peace. In October this year, Indian Prime Minister Nehru's visit to our country and the talks between China and India demonstrated the joint efforts of China and India to expand the peace zone. Now, Prime Minister U Nu's visit to our country and the talks between China and Burma have demonstrated the joint efforts of China and Burma to expand the peace zone. This is not only in line with the common interests of China, Burma and India, but also in line with the interests of peace and security in Asia and the world.
    Prime Minister U Nu said that one of his goals in visiting our country was to lay a solid foundation for friendly relations between the two countries. This is a noble goal shared by the people of China and Burma. There is no doubt that through Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Burma and Prime Minister U Nu's visit to our country, the friendly relations between our two countries have taken a big step forward. In the future, our two countries' closer diplomatic, economic and cultural exchanges, and unremitting efforts in expanding the peace zone, will surely help to improve the welfare of the people of our two countries and help to consolidate peace in Asia and the world. The Chinese people cherish the friendship between the people of China and Burma and are willing to continue to work to further strengthen this friendship.

### 中缅友好合作关系的发展

    中缅友好合作关系的发展
    缅甸联邦总理吴努对我国的友好访问，受到我国人民的重视和热烈欢迎。吴努总理和我国各界代表人物进行了接触，并同我国国家领导人员就两国共同关心的事项，广泛地交换了意见。十二月十二日发表的中缅两国总理会谈公报，具体地表现出两国的友好合作关系有了发展，它给亚洲国家之间在五项原则的基础上和平共处，树立了又一个范例。中缅两国友好合作关系的不断增进，对维护亚洲和世界和平具有重大的意义。
    中缅两国总理会谈公报重申今年六月二十九日两国总理联合声明中所肯定的和平共处的五项原则，并对今后进一步发展我们两国之间的友好合作关系，提供了有利的条件。这就再一次向全世界雄辩地证明：不同社会制度和不同思想体系的国家，是可以和平共处的。吴努总理十二月二日在我国周恩来总理的招待宴会上也说：“这五项和平原则不仅对我们两国而且对世界和平都非常重要。无论是在实利方面还是在正义方面，这五项原则对一切国家都是适当的指导原则。”
    正如会谈公报所指出的，中缅两国总理认为，根据平等互利的原则，促进两国的经济和文化交流是适当的。自中华人民共和国成立以来，中缅两国人民间的经济和文化交流有了相当的发展；两国互相派遣过贸易代表团和文化代表团，对于促进两国之间的经济文化的发展起了很大的作用。中缅两国政府代表团今年四月在仰光和十一月在北京先后签订的中缅贸易协定和换货议定书就是一个很好的例证。为了进一步发展中缅两国之间的贸易关系，两国总理在会谈公报中同意，从一九五五年到一九五七年的三年中，中国每年从缅甸购买十五万吨到二十万吨大米；缅甸则从中国购买中国可能供应的工业设备、工业器材和日用必需品。这预示着中缅两国贸易关系将在平等互利的基础上扩大起来。为适应两国之间这种经济和文化交流的需要，两国总理认为有必要在两国的适当城市互相设立总领事馆，准备开辟中缅两国间的航空线，恢复中缅两国间的公路交通并缔结两国间的邮电协定。毫无疑问，这些措施将能更进一步地促进我们两国间经济往来和文化交流，这对于两国人民改善自己的生活条件，建设自己的国家都是有利的。
    对于中缅两国间的侨民国籍问题和两国未定边界问题，两国总理也进行了极为友好的商谈。两国总理同意，两国政府将在适当的时机内，通过正常的外交途径，求得这两个问题的解决。公报说：“两国总理同意，勉励本国侨民，即侨居中国的缅甸侨民和侨居缅甸的中国侨民，尊重侨居国政府的法律和社会习惯，不参加侨居国的政治活动。两国政府愿意保护对方侨民的正当权利和利益。”由于中缅两国是紧密的邻邦，两国人民间有着悠久的友好往来关系，两国人民互相侨居的情况是必然的。两国总理关于改善两国人民互相侨居情况的协议，不仅体现了两国互相尊重主权和互不干涉内政的原则，符合两国政府和人民的利益；并且互相保证了对方侨民的正当权利，也是符合彼此的侨民的切身利益的。
    中缅两国总理会谈公报表示，两国总理密切关怀巩固和扩大和平地区的问题。这是由于我们两国都是爱好和平的，都需要争取和平的国际环境来建设自己的国家。大家都知道，朝鲜停战和印度支那和平恢复后，国际紧张局势有了缓和。但是，美国侵略集团不欢迎印度支那和平的恢复，不欢迎和平共处的五项原则，不欢迎和平地区的建立。它在今年九月拼凑了所谓“东南亚防务集团”，其目的就是为了破坏日内瓦会议的协议，制造亚洲的分裂，敌视中华人民共和国，干涉亚洲国家的内政。正如吴努总理在眉谬军官年会上发表的演说中所指出的，东南亚公约组织的形成“增加了第三次世界大战的机会”。
    在目前，保证日内瓦会议的协议的贯彻实施，巩固印度支那的和平，稳定东南亚的局势，是有迫切的重要性的。我国政府和人民坚决履行所承担的日内瓦会议协议中的义务，并支持缅甸、印度和其他科伦坡会议国家在这方面的努力。
    中国人民完全同意中缅两国总理会谈公报所指出的：和平共处的五项原则能够并应该为亚洲和世界各国广泛采用；一切国家都应在不受外来干涉和外来侵略的情况下，享受民族独立和生活繁荣的权利。中国人民绝不威胁和侵犯别人，也坚决反对任何人对我们的威胁和侵略。中国人民热烈地要求和平，但是决不会拿自己的领土和主权作代价乞求和平。牺牲领土主权，只能导致进一步的侵略，决不会得到真正的和平。中国人民懂得，只有反抗侵略，才能保卫和平。
    美国和蒋介石卖国集团签订的“共同防御条约”，更是美国赤裸裸地侵占中国领土台湾和澎湖、干涉中国内政、准备对中国发动大规模武装进攻的战争条约。美国的这种侵略行为，完全违反和平共处的五项原则，而企图把战争强加在中国人民的头上。因此，正如中国人民所一再警告的，美国政府必须对由此而引起的一切严重后果担负完全的责任。
    中国人民深信，只要亚洲和全世界所有爱好和平的国家和人民加强团结，击破美国侵略者的一切战争威胁和挑拨阴谋，就能不断扩大和平地区，确保世界和平。今年十月间，印度总理尼赫鲁的访问我国及中印两国的会谈，表现了中印两国对扩大和平地区的共同努力。现在，吴努总理的访问我国和中缅两国的会谈，又表现了中缅两国对扩大和平地区的共同努力。这不仅符合中国、缅甸和印度的共同利益，而且也符合亚洲及世界和平和安全的利益的。
    吴努总理说他访问我国的一个目标，是要为两国友好关系奠立牢固的基础。这是中缅两国人民共有的崇高的目标。没有疑问，通过周恩来总理访问缅甸和吴努总理访问我国，我们两国的友好关系已大大地前进了一步。今后我们两国在外交上经济上和文化上的更加密切的交往，在扩大和平地区方面的不懈努力，一定会有助于我们两国人民福利的增进，有助于亚洲及世界和平的巩固。中国人民珍视中缅两国人民的友谊，并愿为进一步加强这个友谊而继续努力。
