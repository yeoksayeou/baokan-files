　　Turning Around and Catching Up
　　Xiao Wen
　　Today, this edition publishes articles by three township heads and one township party branch secretary, introducing their process of gradually recognizing the grain purchase policy and actively leading farmers to sell surplus grain. These are three very good self-accounts.
　　The thousands upon thousands of rural cadres across the country are a powerful force for implementing the Party and government's policies. They are most familiar with local conditions, have close ties with the masses, and are trusted by them; no rural work can be done without them. In the current grain purchase work, if their thinking is not clear and they conceal grain production, it is difficult for higher-level organs to detect; when their thinking is clear and they mobilize farmers to sell surplus grain, they have the greatest appeal and the best methods.
　　However, to clear the thinking of rural cadres requires efforts from many aspects. It is necessary to continuously improve their ideological level and also to provide them with support in practical work.
　　In the above three self-accounts, these four township cadres examined a one-sided mass viewpoint they once held: fearing that buying too much surplus grain would cause the masses to complain, wanting to allow farmers to keep more grain to live a more comfortable life, and thus not hesitating to conceal the truth from the state by reporting false information. Currently, there is another opposite ideological situation, which is a one-sided task viewpoint developing in some other cadres. In order to complete the grain purchase task, they do not hesitate to use coercive methods towards farmers. Of course, both of these viewpoints are incorrect.
　　Currently, many places, through policy education and the use of detailed accounting methods, have turned around the thinking of many rural cadres and led farmers to enthusiastically sell surplus grain. This is a practical achievement in our work. However, in these educational efforts, most have only focused on how to mobilize farmers to sell surplus grain to the state, and rarely targeted the ideological methods of rural cadres to correct one-sidedness, so that they recognize the fundamental difference between today's grain requisition and purchase and the exploitation of farmers' grain in the reactionary ruling era; recognize the complete consistency between the interests of farmers and the state today, that farmers should obey the interests of the state, and the state should also take care of the real difficulties of farmers in many ways; recognize that it is wrong to use the old concept of so-called "benevolent governance" to accommodate the immediate interests of farmers, and it is also wrong to use coercive methods to oppress farmers. Only by conducting such comprehensive education and correcting the ideological methods of rural cadres can we lay a correct foundation for their ideological transformation.
　　In addition to educating rural cadres, it is also necessary to support them. The most important thing at present is to strengthen unified sales and other material supply work along with the grain purchase work. The above-mentioned self-accounts also reflect one of the biggest concerns of rural cadres at present, which is that they fear that the supply work will still not be done well, and that farmers will not be able to buy back the necessary food and utensils after selling their surplus grain. This concern of theirs is completely understandable. Now, the heavy responsibility of solving this problem falls on the shoulders of the staff of commercial and cooperative departments. Only by doing a good job in supply work can we further support rural cadres in mobilizing farmers to sell grain and cotton, can we effectively eliminate some of the anxiety among farmers, and can we smoothly realize the grain purchase policy.
　　Turning around the thinking of rural cadres and making the supply work catch up, these are the key issues in the current unified purchase work.

    扭过来和赶上去
    肖纹
    今天本版登载了三个乡长和一个乡支部书记的文章，介绍他们如何逐步认清购粮政策并积极带动农民出售余粮的过程。这是三篇很好的自述。
    全国成千上万的乡村干部，是推行党和政府各项政策的强大的队伍。他们最熟悉当地情况，和群众有密切联系并得到群众的信任；农村的任何一件工作，都离不了他们。在目前购粮工作中，如果他们的思想不通，隐瞒粮食产量情况，上级机关是很难发觉的；当他们思想通了，去动员农民出售余粮，他们是最有号召力量和最有办法的。
    但是，要打通乡村干部的思想，是需要从多方面努力的。要不断提高他们的思想水平，也要在实际工作中给他们以支持。
    在上面三篇自述里，这四位乡干部检查了他们曾经有过的一种片面的群众观点：怕多购了余粮群众会埋怨，想多让农民留些粮食使生活过得宽裕一些，因而不惜对国家打埋伏，报假情况。目前，还有另一种相反的思想情况，那就是在另一些干部中正在发展着的片面的任务观点。为了完成购粮任务，他们不惜向农民采用强迫命令的手段。当然，这两种观点都是不正确的。
    目前很多地方通过政策的教育，运用算细账的办法，扭转了不少乡村干部的思想，带领农民踊跃出售余粮，这是我们工作中的实际成就。但是在这些教育工作中，多半还只是偏重于如何动员农民把余粮卖给国家，很少针对乡村干部的思想方法进行教育，纠正片面性，使他们认识今天粮食征购和反动统治时代剥削农民粮食的根本区别；认识今天农民和国家利益的完全一致，农民应该服从国家的利益，国家也要多方面地照顾到农民的真正困难；认识用所谓“仁政”的旧观念来迁就农民的眼前利益是不对的，用强迫命令压迫农民的办法也是错误的。只有进行这样的全面教育，端正乡村干部的思想方法，才能给他们的思想转变奠定一个正确的基础。
    除了对乡村干部进行教育而外，还需要给他们撑腰。目前最重要的就是必须随着购粮工作的进行加强统销工作和其它物资供应工作。上述的自述中也反映了目前乡村干部的最大顾虑之一，就是怕供应工作仍然作不好，农民卖了余粮后买不回必要的食料和用具。他们的这个顾虑是完全可以理解的。现在，解决这个问题的重担，落到商业、合作部门职工的肩上了。只有作好供应工作，才可以进一步支持乡村干部动员农民出售粮棉的工作，才可以有效地消除农民中的某些不安情绪，才可以使购粮政策顺利地实现。
    扭转乡村干部的思想，并使供应工作赶上去，这是目前统购工作中的关键问题。
