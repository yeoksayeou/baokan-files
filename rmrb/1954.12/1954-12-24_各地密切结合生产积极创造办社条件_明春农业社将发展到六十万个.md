Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: This winter and next spring, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, including those already existing, will develop to 500,000 to 600,000. This is a plan formulated by local organizations of the Chinese Communist Party at all levels based on the demands of the peasants, the experience of building cooperatives before the autumn harvest, and the possible conditions. After the implementation of this cooperative establishment plan, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide will increase to nearly three times the current number; in the old liberated areas, more than 30 percent of the total number of peasant households will join cooperatives, and most townships in the late liberated areas will have cooperatives, at least one in each district.

Since the beginning of autumn, various localities have carried out a series of preparatory work to realize this plan. All localities have closely integrated with production, successively cultivated a large number of mutual aid teams as targets for developing cooperatives, and trained more than a million key members of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Hunan Province has focused on cultivating 39,000 mutual aid teams and trained more than 71,000 key members. In Jiangxi Province, 25,000 mutual aid teams have been cultivated and are qualified to establish cooperatives. In Nanchong Prefecture, Sichuan Province, 1,279 mutual aid teams are qualified to establish cooperatives. Henan Province has trained 300,000 key members of mutual aid and cooperation organizations. Shandong Province plans to train 250,000 district and township cadres, key members of cooperative establishment, and accounting personnel of agricultural production cooperatives this winter, and the first batch of training plans is about to end, and some places have started the second and third batches of training.

In the training work, all localities have paid great attention to educating key members about the Communist Party's class line in rural areas, criticized the erroneous ideas of some cadres and key members who excluded poor peasants, discriminated against middle peasants, and lost vigilance against the destructive activities of rich peasants, so that the grassroots cadres and activists participating in the study further realized that the correct implementation of the Communist Party's class policy is the fundamental guarantee for the healthy development of agricultural production cooperatives.

After entering winter, the Rural Work Departments of the CCP Provincial Committees successively convened mutual aid and cooperation meetings attended by the main leaders and deputy ministers of the prefectural and county party committees. The secretaries and deputy secretaries of the provincial party committees personally participated in the meetings, and some also made reports to the conference. At the meeting, the spirit and resolutions of the Fourth National Mutual Aid and Cooperation Conference convened by the Rural Work Department of the CCP Central Committee were conveyed, and the work of developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the local area was checked and deployed respectively. All meetings emphasized that the work of developing agricultural production cooperatives this winter and next spring must be done well, and no bad work is allowed; doing a good job in this batch of cooperatives is the key to further carrying out the agricultural cooperation movement, and it is to lay a good foundation for future large-scale development. The party committees at all levels must shift the focus of leading rural work to mutual aid and cooperation. The meeting required that the establishment of cooperatives must rely on the CCP branches in the countryside, and opposed the work style of cadres taking over everything; class policy education must be carried out systematically to improve the level of cadres and key members in establishing cooperatives; relevant departments should serve the large-scale development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations around this central task.

Subsequently, the CCP prefectural and county party committees convened enlarged meetings of cadres, carried out layer-by-layer deployment, clarified the division of labor, and formulated a system to ensure the implementation of the plan for developing cooperatives. According to the current reports from various places, the vast majority of counties across the country have ended this meeting, and cadres have gone to the countryside separately. In this way, the work of developing a large number of cooperatives this winter and next spring is being carried out on the basis of planning, preparation, and step-by-step implementation.

    各地密切结合生产积极创造办社条件
    明春农业社将发展到六十万个
    【新华社二十三日讯】今冬明春，全国的农业生产合作社连同原有的在内，将发展五十万到六十万个。这是中共各级地方组织根据农民的要求、秋前建社经验和可能条件制订出来的计划。这个建社计划实现后，全国农业生产合作社的数量将比现在增加到近三倍；老解放区将有占农户总数百分之三十多的农户入社，晚解放区大部分乡都会有社，至少是区区有社。
    入秋以来，各地为实现这一计划做了一系列准备工作。各地都密切结合生产，先后培养了大批的互助组作为发展社的对象，并训练了百万以上的互助合作组织的骨干分子。湖南省重点培养了三万九千个互助组，并训练了七万一千多名骨干分子。江西省已有经过培养的两万五千个互助组具备了办社条件。四川省南充专区有一千二百七十九个互助组具备了办社的条件。河南省已经训练了三十万名互助合作组织的骨干分子。山东省今冬计划训练二十五万区乡干部、办社骨干分子和农业生产合作社会计人员，第一批训练计划即将结束，某些地方已开始了第二和第三批训练。
    各地在训练工作中，非常注意向骨干分子进行共产党在农村中的阶级路线的教育，批判了某些干部和骨干分子排斥贫农、歧视中农和对富农的破坏活动失去警惕的错误思想，使参加学习的基层干部和积极分子进一步认识到：正确贯彻共产党的阶级政策是农业生产合作社健康发展的根本保证。
    进入冬季之后，中共各省党委农村工作部又先后召开了地委、县委主要负责人和正副部长参加的互助合作会议，省委书记、副书记亲自参加了这一会议，有的还向大会作了报告。在会议上，传达了中共中央农村工作部召开的全国第四次互助合作会议的精神和决议，分别检查和布置了当地发展互助合作组织的工作。所有会议都强调指出：今冬明春发展农业生产合作社的工作必须办好，不许办坏；办好这批社，是进一步开展农业合作化运动的关键，是为今后大发展奠定良好的基础，各级党委要把领导农村工作的中心转移到互助合作方面来。会议要求，必须依靠农村里的中共支部办社，反对干部包办代替作风；必须系统地进行阶级政策教育，提高干部和骨干分子的办社水平；有关部门要围绕这一中心任务，为互助合作组织大发展服务。
    接着，各地中共地委、县委又分别召开了干部扩大会议，进行了层层布置，明确了分工，并制订了制度来保证发展社的计划的执行。据目前各地汇报材料，全国绝大多数县已结束了这一会议，干部已分头进入农村。这样，今冬明春大量发展合作社的工作，就在有计划、有准备、有步骤的基础上开展起来了。
