Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: The African National Congress of the Union of South Africa held its 42nd Delegates' Meeting in Durban from the 16th to the 19th.

Due to this policy, 85,000 non-European people are facing the threat of losing their homes and property, many people who criticize this policy and local people's leaders have been deprived of freedom of speech and assembly, and progressive newspapers have also been closed down. The task of the meeting is to study the current situation in South Africa, decide on countermeasures, and prepare for holding a People's Congress to draft a "Freedom Charter" for the South African people.

All-China Federation of Trade Unions Chairman Lai Ruoyu sent a telegram of congratulations to the meeting on the eve of its opening (December 15th). The text of the telegram is as follows: Secretariat of the African National Congress:

Pleased to learn that the African National Congress is holding its 42nd Delegates' Meeting, I hereby extend warm congratulations on behalf of all the working people of China. I wish the meeting greater achievements in uniting Africans and uniting all the people of South Africa, regardless of race or color, in the cause of safeguarding basic human rights, resisting racial discrimination and oppression, and striving for peace, freedom, democracy, and progress.

    南非非洲人国民大会在德班举行代表会议
    我全国总工会主席赖若愚致电祝贺
    【新华社十六日讯】南非联邦的非洲人国民大会在十六日至十九日在德班举行第四十二次代表会议。
    这次会议是在南非联邦政府加紧推行镇压和种族歧视政策的情况下举行的。由于这种政策，非欧洲种族的八万五千人正在受到失去家园和财产的威胁，批评这种政策的许多人和当地人民的领袖都被剥夺了言论和集会的自由，进步的报纸也被封闭了。会议的任务是要研究南非目前的局势，决定对策，并且筹备举行人民代表大会以拟订南非人民的“自由宪章”。
    中华全国总工会主席  赖若愚在会议开幕前夕（十五日）去电报向会议祝贺。电文如下：非洲人国民大会书记处：
    欣悉非洲人国民大会举行第四十二次代表会议，谨代表中国全体劳动人民致热烈的祝贺。祝会议在团结非洲人和不分种族、肤色地团结所有的南非人民去为保障基本人权，为反抗种族歧视和压迫，为争取和平、自由、民主和进步而斗争的事业中，获得更多的成就。
                中华全国总工会主席  赖若愚
