    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 7th: The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" condemned the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the US government and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in its "International Commentary" column on the 6th.

    The commentary stated: It is clear that the purpose of the US ruling clique in signing this treaty is to attempt to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and to turn Taiwan into a military base for aggression against the People's Republic of China and other Asian countries.

    The commentary pointed out: The provocative schemes of the American aggressors, who are hostile to the People's Republic of China, are seriously threatening peace and security in Asia. The people of Asia resolutely condemn the schemes of the American aggressors to deepen tensions in Asia.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”斥美蒋条约威胁亚洲和平
    【新华社平壤七日电】朝鲜“劳动新闻”六日在“国际述评”栏中斥责美国政府和蒋介石卖国集团签订的所谓“共同防御条约”。
    述评说：很明显，美国统治集团签订这个条约的目的是企图阻挠中国人民解放台湾，并把台湾变成侵略中华人民共和国和其它亚洲国家的军事基地。
    述评指出：美国侵略者敌视中华人民共和国的挑衅的策划，正严重地威胁着亚洲的和平和安全。亚洲人民坚决斥责美国侵略者企图加深亚洲紧张局势的策划。
