Activities of Party Organizations in Various Localities

    Improving General Leadership Style
    After the Party Representative Meeting, the Shanghai Textile Industry Committee of the Chinese Communist Party formulated measures to improve the generalized leadership style. The Party Committee Secretary and members of the Party Committee decided to frequently go deep into factories to understand the situation and help grassroots organizations solve problems. The full-time members of the Party Committee are now personally in charge of the Shanghai East, Shanghai West, and Miscellaneous Spinning work groups. These three work groups have respectively selected Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Shanghai State-owned No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory, and No. 2 Wool Spinning Factory to focus on inspecting the establishment of the responsibility system, work plans, and the improvement of product quality. The fourth quarter work was arranged based on the problems discovered. For general factories, in addition to regularly arranging work inspections and summaries, the Party Committee members also made specific divisions of labor, deciding to strengthen regular leadership of various factories and mines through irregular meeting reports and individual contacts to promptly convey instructions from above and understand the situation below. The Party Committee decided that in the future, when arranging work, it should first solicit the opinions of the leading cadres of the Party committees of various factories, and after repeated deliberation, then implement it downwards, so that the plan is more in line with reality. In addition, measures were also stipulated to improve the Party committee system to implement the Party's principle of collective leadership.
    Helping to Rectify Pastoral Mutual Aid Teams
    The Chen Barag Banner Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Inner Mongolia recently transferred more than 20 capable cadres from the Banner and Sumu (district) levels to form twelve work groups, which went deep into twelve pastoral perennial mutual aid teams, such as the Dageseleng team, to conduct background investigations and rectification work. Before the work groups went down, the Banner Working Committee concentrated the cadres participating in this work in the Banner for training, clearly explaining to them the Party's mutual aid and cooperation guidelines and policies, as well as specific rectification methods. The work groups will further enhance the members' understanding of mutual aid and cooperation by further publicizing the Constitution, the general task of the state during the transition period, and the guidelines and policies of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. They will also further investigate and study methods to solve the problem of mutual benefit, and also help to summarize the production work since the organization of the mutual aid team and establish necessary systems.
    Ensuring the Compilation of Next Year's Plan
    On November 20, the Industry Department of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of secretaries of Party committees (general branches) of state-owned, local state-owned factories, and transportation departments to urge everyone to ensure the compilation of next year's plan. The meeting analyzed the situation of each factory's compilation of next year's enterprise production plan, pointing out that the main problems in the current planning work of each factory are that the plan is too conservative, and some plans are unrealistic. The various links of some factory plans cannot be closely integrated, especially there is a serious disconnect between supply, production, and sales. The basic reason for these shortcomings is that the Party organization does not pay enough attention to supervising the administrative aspects of compiling next year's enterprise plan, thus lacking political and ideological leadership; the administrative leaders of some units also do not actively seek the leadership of the Party organization, and when compiling the plan, only a few administrative cadres study it and then report it.
    The meeting required the Party organizations of each factory to strengthen the political and ideological leadership of the planning work, conscientiously implement the policy of increasing production and practicing economy into the planning work, and put forward different requirements according to the different situations of each enterprise. The Party organization should do a good job in reviewing the plan, criticizing the conservative thinking and one-sided views of cadres, educating cadres, establishing a work style of in-depth investigation and research and relying on the masses, and making the plan both advanced and practical.
    Solving Key Issues in Increasing Production and Practicing Economy
    After the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement in the Changzhou Public-Private Joint Venture Dacheng No. 1 Textile Factory, the workers' enthusiasm was very high, and each workshop put forward 205 opinions, from installing light switches to management systems, but they could not solve the key problems in production. The main reason for this situation is that the leading cadres' understanding of the purpose and requirements of implementing the increase production and practice economy campaign was not clear enough, and they did not seriously check and analyze the current production situation and grasp the key issues.
    In mid-November, the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Changzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party went to the factory to inspect the implementation of the increase production and practice economy campaign, specifically helping the factory's Party committee to seriously analyze and study the implementation of the production plan in October and early November, and respectively pointed out the key problems in production. For example: in the spinning department, the focus should be on solving the current problems of poor cotton yarn quality, excessive cotton knots and impurities, and large differences in twist; in the weaving department, attention should be paid to improving the positive cloth rate and solving the problem of yarn loss. The factory's leading cadres put forward various specific measures to solve these problems and organized technicians and some workers to form four special research groups to formulate technical measures and improve various systems. At the same time, specific requirements for increasing production and practicing economy were put forward to each workshop and department, guiding workers to find reasons and think of solutions in a purposeful manner. Workers in various workshops and groups have initially launched discussions, and many groups have formulated guarantee conditions and launched labor competitions.

    各地党组织的活动
    改进一般化的领导作风
    中共上海纺织工业委员会在经过党代表会议后，订出了改进一般化领导作风的办法。党委书记和党委委员决定经常深入工厂，了解情况，帮助基层组织解决问题。党委专职委员现在亲自掌握沪东、沪西、杂纺三个工作组。这三个工作组又分别选择上海国营第一棉纺织厂、上海国营第十六棉纺织厂及第二毛纺厂，着重检查了建立责任制、作业计划和提高产品质量等问题。针对发现的问题布置了第四季度工作。对一般工厂，除了定期布置工作检查总结外，党委委员也作了具体分工，决定通过不定期的会议汇报和个别联系，及时传达上面的指示和了解下面的情况，加强对各厂矿的经常领导。党委决定今后布置工作时要事先征求各厂党委领导骨干的意见，经过反复酝酿后，再往下贯彻，以使计划更切合实际。此外还规定了健全党委制的办法，以贯彻党的集体领导原则。
    帮助整顿牧业互助组
    中共内蒙古陈巴尔虎旗工作委员会最近抽调二十多名旗、苏木（区）的得力干部，组成十二个工作组，分别深入达格色楞等十二个牧业常年互助组，进行摸底和整顿工作。工作组没下去以前，旗工作委员会在旗里集中训练了参加这次工作的干部，向他们明确交代了互助合作的方针、政策，以及整顿的具体办法。各工作组将通过进一步宣传宪法、国家过渡时期总任务和互助合作运动的方针、政策等，提高组员对互助合作的认识。并进一步调查研究解决互利问题的办法，还要帮助总结组织互助组以来的生产工作，建立必要的制度。
      保证编好明年计划
    中共旅大市委工业部于十一月二十日召开了国营、地方国营工厂和交通运输部门党委（总支）书记会议，督促大家保证编好明年计划。会议对各厂编制明年企业生产计划的情况作了分析，指出当前各厂在编制计划工作中的主要问题是计划订得太保守，有的计划又不切实际。有些工厂的计划各个环节不能紧密结合，特别是供、产、销三者之间有严重的脱节现象。产生这些缺点的基本原因是党组织对监督行政方面编制明年企业计划不够重视，因而缺乏政治思想领导；有些单位的行政领导干部，也不主动地取得党组织的领导，编制计划时，只是几个行政干部研究一下就上报。
    会议要求各厂党组织必须加强对编制计划工作的政治思想领导，把增产节约的方针认真贯彻到编制计划的工作中去，根据各企业的不同情况，提出不同的要求。党组织应该做好对计划的审查工作，批判干部中的保守思想和片面观点，教育干部，树立深入调查研究和依靠群众的工作作风，把计划订得既先进又切实。
    解决增产节约中的关键问题
    常州公私合营大成第一纺织厂的增产节约运动开展后，工人们的热情都很高，各车间提出了二百零五条意见，从装电灯开关一直到管理制度都提到了，但却解决不了生产中的关键问题。产生这种情况的主要原因是领导干部对贯彻增产节约的目的和要求认识不够明确，没有认真地检查和分析当前生产情况，抓住关键问题。
    十一月中旬，中共常州市委书记和副书记等到该厂检查增产节约贯彻情况，具体帮助该厂党委认真地把十月份和十一月上旬的生产计划执行情况作了分析研究，分别指出生产中的关键问题。例如：在纺部要着重解决目前棉纱质量差、棉结杂质多，捻度差异大等问题；在织部要注意提高正布率和解决亏纱问题。厂里领导干部提出了解决这些问题的各项具体措施，并组织技术人员和部分工人成立了四个专门研究小组，制订技术措施和改进各项制度。同时，对各车间、部门提出增产节约的具体要求，引导工人有目的的去找原因想办法。各车间、小组工人已初步展开了讨论，并有许多小组订出保证条件，开展了劳动竞赛。
