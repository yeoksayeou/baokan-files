    [Our Newspaper] The employees of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Smelting Plant, in the labor competition to greet 1955, have comprehensively overfulfilled the November tasks and plan to produce an additional 4,000 tons of pig iron on top of completing the annual state plan.
    Since November, inter-furnace competitions have been launched among workers of the same type. Raw material workers have basically corrected the phenomenon of inaccurate charging and material leakage, and the advanced Soviet experience of "steam blowing" has been successfully implemented in No. 7 blast furnace, with other blast furnaces also starting to promote it. At the same time, the quality of coke from the Chemical Plant and the iron content of sintered ore from the Ore Dressing Plant have also improved, and the Transportation Department and the Power Plant have also created convenient conditions for the Smelting Plant. By the end of November, the Smelting Plant had overfulfilled the November state plan by 6,591 tons of pig iron. In addition to making up for the pig iron owed to the state in the past ten months, it also exceeded the target by more than 1,000 tons. The quality of iron produced reached 92 percent, exceeding the state plan by 2 percent, and the cost was also reduced by more than 2 percent compared with the state plan, with labor productivity increasing by 6.15 percent. Now, all the employees of the plant are working hard to complete the annual plan and increase pig iron production by 4,000 tons.

    迎接一九五五年展开劳动竞赛
    鞍钢炼铁厂十一月份增产生铁六千多吨
    【本报讯】鞍钢炼铁厂职工在迎接一九五五年的劳动竞赛中，全面地超额完成了十一月份任务，并计划除完成全年的国家计划外，再增产四千吨生铁。
    十一月份以来，各个炼铁炉之间开展了同工种竞赛，原料工人基本上改正了装料分量不准确的跑料现象，并在第七号炼铁炉成功地推行了苏联“蒸气鼓风”的先进经验，其他炼铁炉也都开始推广。同时化工总厂焦炭的质量，选矿厂烧结矿的含铁量也都有提高，运输部、发电厂也都给炼铁厂创造了便利条件。到十一月底，炼铁厂已超额六千五百九十一吨生铁完成了十一月国家计划，除补上过去十个月欠国家的生铁外，还超额一千多吨。制钢铁的质量达到百分之九十二，超过国家计划百分之二，成本也比国家计划降低了百分之二以上，劳动生产率提高百分之六点一五。现在全厂职工正在为完成全年计划和增产四千吨生铁而努力。
