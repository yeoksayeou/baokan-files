Premier U Nu's Speech

Mr. Mayor:

    I would like to thank you for the warm welcome given to me by the citizens of Beijing. Although the weather is cold, your warm welcome has dispelled the chill.

    There is a historical and traditional friendship between the people of China and Myanmar. It is worth mentioning that in your five thousand years of history, there have only been two wars between our two countries. But as I said last time, even these aggressions were not carried out by the Chinese; the first was by the Mongols, and the second was by the Manchus.

    After we were conquered by foreign forces, the social and cultural exchanges between our two countries were disrupted. But now that Myanmar has become an independent country, and China has severed the ropes used by colonial powers to bind it, we can freely restore the traditional friendship of the past.

    Since Myanmar dispatched diplomatic envoys here, truthful reports of the friendly wishes of the Chinese people have been received in Myanmar. Our various visiting delegations engaged in cultural exchange, trade, and observation have all confirmed this point. Although at first, we may have had doubts about China's intentions, these anxieties have been eliminated thanks to the visit of your respected Premier and the announcement of the Five Principles, which the whole world should emulate and abide by.

    I braved the cold to come to Beijing, and I have learned a lot and benefited greatly. I will bring back the most pleasant memories and convey your welcome and goodwill to the people of Yangon and Myanmar. On behalf of my wife, myself, and the members of the delegation, I thank you for your welcome. I wish Mr. Mayor and the citizens of Beijing good health and happiness. I wish the People's Republic of China increasing prosperity and the people of the People's Republic of China happiness.

    吴努总理的讲话市长先生：
    我谨向你感谢北京市民给予我的热烈欢迎。天气虽冷，但是你们的热烈欢迎抵消了寒冷。
    中缅两国人民之间有着历史的和传统的友谊，值得提出的是在你们五千年的历史中，两国之间只有过两次战争。但正像我上次所说过的，就是这些侵略也并不是由中国人进行的，第一次是由蒙古人，而第二次是由满洲人进行的。
    在我们被外国势力征服之后，我们两国之间的社会和文化的交往被扰乱了。但是现在缅甸已经成为一个独立的国家，而中国也已经割断了殖民国家用来束缚它的绳索，我们可以自由地恢复过去的传统友谊。
    自从缅甸在此地派遣了外交使节之后，在缅甸就得到了关于中国人民的友好愿望的真实报告。我们的从事文化交流、贸易和考察的各种访问代表团都证实了这点。虽然在起初，我们对中国的意图也许还有疑虑，但是由于你们的尊敬的总理的访问和全世界都应仿效和遵守的五项原则的宣布，已使这些不安消除了。
    我冒着寒冷来到了北京，我学到了很多，得益也很大。我将带回最愉快的记忆，并把你们的欢迎和善意转达给仰光和缅甸人民。我代表我的妻子和我本人以及代表团的团员们，对你们的欢迎表示感谢。我谨祝市长先生和北京市民们健康和幸福。祝人民共和国日益繁荣，祝人民共和国人民幸福。
