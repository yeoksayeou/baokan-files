Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: While the vast number of farmers in non-disaster areas are selling large quantities of surplus grain, people in disaster areas of Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces are continuously receiving grain supplies from the state. Grain supply stations distributed throughout the disaster areas now have ample reserves, and grain prices have remained stable at pre-flood levels. Ships and wooden boats laden with grain are setting off daily to transport grain to disaster areas. New grain from Sichuan Province is being shipped along the Yangtze River to disaster areas in Hubei Province, and grain purchased this year in Rehe Province is being transferred to Anhui. Since the occurrence of the floods, the state's work of supplying grain to these disaster areas has not been interrupted. From July to mid-November, the grain departments transferred 150 million jin of rice to the Dongting Lake flood area; from July to the end of October, the grain supplied to Anhui Province disaster areas nearly doubled the amount supplied in the same period last year. Some disaster areas in Hubei Province originally issued grain purchase certificates several times a month, but now, to facilitate the disaster victims, they have been changed to issuing them to households once a month or once a quarter. Now the people in the disaster areas are at ease carrying out production at home.

[Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 9th] Grain distribution and evaluation work has concluded in most areas of Sichuan Province, and grain-deficient households that have been evaluated have all received grain supply certificates issued by the government.

This year's grain distribution work in Sichuan Province was carried out in conjunction with unified purchase. While assessing unified purchase households, investigations were also conducted on unified distribution households. The grain distribution and evaluation work in various places has generally been carried out conscientiously and meticulously. When carrying out grain distribution and evaluation in the Jiangjin Special District, the list of supply households and the quantity needed were submitted to the masses for discussion, and the evaluation results were announced to the masses. After the distribution and evaluation in the Luzhou Special District, a general inspection was also carried out, and adjustments were made in a timely manner to individual supply areas where the supply volume was too high or too low. A small number of new members of the Lulongfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luxian County lacked food rations. The entire cooperative decided to solve the problem through mutual adjustment among the cooperative members, without requiring supplies from the state.

    国家源源供应灾区人民粮食
    四川大部地区的缺粮户收到了粮食供应证
    据新华社九日讯：当广大非灾区的农民大量出卖余粮的时候，湖北、湖南、安徽等省灾区人民源源得到国家粮食的供应。分布在灾区的各个粮食供应站现在存粮充足，粮食价格一直稳定在水灾前的水平。现在每天都有轮船和木船满载着粮食向灾区运去。四川省的新粮顺着长江运到了湖北省灾区，热河省今年收购的粮食正往安徽调运。自发生水灾以来，国家对这些灾区供应粮食的工作一直没有中断。七月到十一月中旬，粮食部门调到洞庭湖滨水灾区的大米达一亿五千万斤；七月到十月底供应安徽省灾区的粮食比去年同期供应数量差不多增加一倍半。湖北省有些灾区原来每月发几次购粮证，现在为便利灾民，改为按月或按季度一次发放到户。现在灾区人民安心在家生产。
    【新华社成都九日电】四川省大部地区粮食统销评议工作已经结束，经评定过的缺粮户都已收到政府发给的粮食供应证。
    今年四川省粮食统销工作是结合统购进行的，在评定统购户同时，对统销户也进行了调查。各地粮食统销评议工作一般都作得认真细致。江津专区在进行统销评议时，都把供应户名单和需要供应的数量交群众讨论，并把评定结果向群众公布。泸州专区在统销评议结束后，还普遍进行了一次检查，对个别供应地区供应量偏高偏低的现象，及时加以调整。泸县泸拢锋农业生产合作社有少数新入社的社员缺少口粮，全社决定由社内社员相互调剂解决，不要国家供应。
