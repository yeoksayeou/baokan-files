The Chinese people are vehemently opposed to the towering crime of the American aggressors openly occupying our territory of Taiwan and preparing for world war. December 2, 1954, is the day the American aggressors openly colluded with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to forcibly occupy Taiwan in the form of a so-called "mutual defense treaty." The Chinese people must never forget this, and the Chinese people will never allow the fact of American occupation of Taiwan to continue to exist.

Taiwan is an integral part of China's sacred territory. This is a recognized historical fact. The "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," which were signed by the United States, confirmed this and stipulated that Taiwan should be returned to China. And in fact, Taiwan had already been returned to China after Japan's surrender. However, the United States reneged on its international obligations and forcibly occupied Taiwan in 1950. Now it is attempting to use the method of concluding a "treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to occupy Taiwan "indefinitely." Article 7 of the "treaty" openly stipulates that "the Government of the Republic of China grants, and the United States of America accepts, the right to deploy United States land, sea, and air forces in Taiwan, Penghu, and their vicinity as required for defense as determined by common agreement." Everyone knows that the Chinese people have long overthrown the heinous rule of Chiang Kai-shek and established the great People's Republic of China. The government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government of the Chinese people. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, such a putrid political corpse, has become a tool for the United States to invade China. Its selling out of the motherland's territory and sovereignty is already a heinous crime, and the American aggressors' use of the "treaty" signed with it to occupy Taiwan is an even more robbery-like action that violates all international regulations. The Chinese people will never tolerate this blatant act of aggression by the United States in plundering Chinese territory and infringing upon Chinese sovereignty.

Dulles's claim that the U.S.-Chiang "treaty" is "purely defensive" is a complete lie. Articles 2 and 5 of the U.S.-Chiang "treaty" openly stipulate that the United States will not hesitate to gamble on war to interfere in China's internal affairs and obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. Not only that, but this "treaty" also openly encourages the Chiang Kai-shek traitor to invade the mainland to provoke a major war. According to Article 6, the scope of armed aggression encompassed in Articles 2 and 5 of the U.S.-Chiang "treaty" shall also "apply to such other territories as may be determined by common agreement." The reactionary public opinion in the United States and Britain has been busy trying to conceal and deceive the people for the American aggressors these days. They insist that the treaty is for peace. But this sentence in the "treaty" slapped them loudly in the face. In fact, the war conspiracy of the American aggressive clique is very obvious. Dulles openly clamored that "the treaty stipulates the base rights of the United States in Taiwan," and that the United States "must be able to freely mobilize its troops... to retaliate." Dulles also said that "this treaty will be another link in the collective security system established by the various collective defense treaties that the United States has concluded with other countries in the Pacific region." He said that "these arrangements together constitute the 'central system' for the people of the free countries of the Western Pacific to resist Communist aggression." Everyone in the world knows that no country is invading the United States or infringing upon the security of the United States. On the contrary, the United States is everywhere forcibly occupying the territory of other countries as military bases and attempting to turn the oceans of the world into American inland lakes. On the other hand, the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries have consistently strived for peace and advocated the five principles of non-aggression and non-interference in internal affairs. Therefore, the fair-minded people and the broad masses of the people in the world already have an answer as to where the aggression comes from. Dulles's so-called "defense," "security," and "resistance to Communist aggression" are nothing more than learning from Hitler's method to conceal their war policy. Isn't this clear enough? Judging from the provisions of this "treaty" and from Dulles's words, the United States is attempting to link the U.S.-Chiang "treaty" with the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc and the planned "Northeast Asia Alliance" and other military treaties, to expand aggression against China and Asia, to prepare to drag some of America's followers into military adventures, and to provoke war. Isn't this obvious? From this, it can be seen that the U.S.-Chiang "treaty" is a thorough and complete "treaty" to prepare for a war of aggression.

Dulles openly stated that if the United States launches a provocative attack on the People's Republic of China, "it does not technically constitute war" because "a state of war only exists between two mutually recognized governments." This is actually setting up a pretext for the American aggressors to launch a war of aggression against China at any time and under any excuse to evade legal responsibility. But this kind of excuse is useless. This barbaric practice of the American aggressors is completely inheriting the old mantle of the Japanese militarists' past aggression against China. People know that when the Japanese militarists occupied our Northeast as a base in the past, they said that their aggression "did not constitute war." And when they launched a massive offensive against China in 1937, they also said that their aggression against China "did not constitute war" because it was not in a "state of war." The painful lessons of the Japanese militarists' aggression against China and various Asian countries are still fresh in the memory of the Chinese people and the people of various Asian countries. The American aggressors dare to think that the Chinese people will forget this historical lesson. They actually think that the 600 million people of the great People's Republic of China can be bullied, and that the peace-loving people of Asia and the world can be deceived. Then they are greatly mistaken. If the American aggressors are determined to follow the old path of Japanese militarism, then this time, it will still not be the Chinese people who will be severely鞭打 by history, but the crazy American aggressors.

While the American aggressors are forcibly occupying Chinese territory and preparing for a war of aggression against China, they are actually trying to use the United Nations Charter as a cover for their evil ambitions. The preamble to the U.S.-Chiang war treaty shamelessly states at the beginning that the U.S. and Chiang "reaffirm their faith in the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter." This kind of ghost talk can only be regarded as the greatest mockery and insult to the United Nations Charter. The United Nations Charter, which embodies the will of the peace-loving people of all countries, clearly stipulates that its purpose and principle is to maintain international peace and security, and stipulates that no country is allowed to infringe upon the territorial integrity and political independence of any member state or country. However, since the U.S.-Chiang war treaty blatantly infringes upon Chinese territory and is aimed at preparing for a large-scale war of aggression against China, this blatantly violates the aforementioned solemn provisions of the United Nations Charter. The American aggressors cannot shirk their shameful crime of destroying the United Nations Charter.

The fact is very clear that the signing of the U.S.-Chiang treaty is bound to cause the deterioration of the situation in the Far East and Asia. The further collusion between the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is not only a serious war provocation to the Chinese people, but also threatens the security of the Far East and Asian countries. At present, the Taiwan issue has become a key issue in maintaining peace in the Far East and Asia. All countries and people who truly desire peace should not turn a blind eye to the American aggressors' actions of invading Chinese territory, Taiwan, undermining peace in the Far East, and preparing for a new war of aggression. Tolerance and condoning war policies is a harm to world peace. History has taught us countless times. People must make a choice at such a juncture.

Faced with the situation in which the American aggressive clique is openly carrying out war provocations, the British government has adopted a supportive attitude towards this practice of the United States. On the one hand, the British government recognizes the People's Republic of China as the legal government of China; on the other hand, it openly supports the American aggressive clique in invading our territory, Taiwan, and openly believes that Chinese traitors and national sellouts can occupy Taiwan. This is not only intolerable in terms of morality, but also violates the norms of international relations. On December 1, a British Foreign Office spokesman issued a statement on the signing of the war "treaty" between the United States and Chiang, saying that the British government had "been generally aware of" the negotiations on the war "treaty" between the United States and Chiang "for a long time and has maintained frequent contact with the United States government on the general situation in the Far East." The United States also said that the text of the "treaty" had been shown to Britain long ago. This proves that the conclusion of the U.S.-Chiang war "treaty" was not only agreed to by the British government, but the British government also participated in it. The British spokesman also said that there is a so-called "future status" issue for Taiwan, and advocated that this "status must be acceptable to all parties directly concerned and must be consulted with them." Everyone knows that this sentence of Britain obviously refers to the so-called "neutralization of Taiwan" or "independent state of Taiwan." However, the status of Taiwan has long been determined. Taiwan is, has been, and will always be Chinese territory. The only issue now is to stop the United States from forcibly occupying Taiwan, oppose the United States' interference in China's internal affairs, and withdraw American armed forces. The Chinese people will never allow the occupation of Taiwan by the so-called "neutralization" or "independent state" of Taiwan. This is very obvious.

Britain knows China's just position of liberating Taiwan, and its attitude is obviously knowingly doing wrong, willingly disregarding its own interests and following the United States in adopting an unfriendly attitude towards the Chinese people, and violating the international obligations undertaken by Britain in the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation." Britain should remember how Japan's aggression against our Northeast 23 years ago developed into a world war. At that time, even Britain suffered serious damage. Does the British government still want to follow the US war policy to repeat this experience today? Can anyone still think that the great Chinese people today can be used as a sacrifice for the US policy of aggression? The era in which foreign imperialism decided Chinese affairs is gone forever. Whoever does not want to face such an ironclad fact will make a big mistake.

It must be pointed out that some people acknowledge that Taiwan is Chinese territory and also acknowledge that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is China's internal affair. However, they remain silent about the United States' occupation of Chinese territory, Taiwan, and its deliberate use of force to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. They mistakenly believe that the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan will create a tense situation. This is actually wanting to sacrifice China's territorial sovereignty and the interests of the Chinese people, especially the interests of the Chinese people in Taiwan, to succumb to the United States' aggressive behavior. The result can only be to condone the United States' aggressive policy and war policy. There has also been this kind of practice of taking a tacit attitude towards the behavior of invading other countries in history. But this has precisely expanded the war of aggression, leading to World War II, and even those who tacitly approved of the aggressors suffered greatly. The Chinese people understand this particularly deeply. The Chinese people advocate peace and have used all means to seek peace. However, the Chinese people have used brilliant facts to prove from their own struggle against imperialist aggression that only by resolutely defeating aggression and defending the security, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the motherland can we never beg for peace by sacrificing our national sovereignty and the interests of the people, and we must not endanger and destroy peace by acquiescing in and allowing the United States to carry out aggression arbitrarily. Peace can only be guaranteed by stopping aggression. Therefore, the Chinese people cannot ignore the war treaty signed between the United States and Chiang.

The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is precisely for the inviolability of the sovereignty and territory of our country and all countries, for defending the vital interests of our people and the people of all countries, that is, for defending peace in the Far East and the world. This truth is extremely obvious. Accepting this truth and resolutely opposing the United States' aggressive behavior will make a great contribution to the cause of world peace.

Taiwan is Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan and defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the motherland is the firm and unwavering policy of the Chinese government and people and is our sacred responsibility. No foreign interference can stop the Chinese people's determination to liberate their own territory, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands. No intimidation and threats can shake the Chinese people's firm will and actions to defend their sovereignty and territory and defend peace. The Chinese people must unite more closely with unwavering will, redouble their efforts, and resolutely fight to the end to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Chinese people will never give up until Taiwan is liberated. If the American aggressive clique dares to further implement armed intervention, then the US government must bear the responsibility for all the serious consequences.

### 中国人民不解放台湾决不罢休！

    中国人民不解放台湾决不罢休！
    中国人民以极大的愤怒反对美国侵略者公开强占我国领土台湾、准备世界战争的滔天罪行。一九五四年十二月二日是美国侵略者公然同蒋介石卖国贼以所谓
  “共同防御条约”的形式强占台湾的日子，中国人民绝不能忘记，中国人民绝不会让美国强占台湾这个事实存在下去。
    台湾是中国神圣领土的一部分，这是公认的历史的事实。美国签了字的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”确认了这些，并规定台湾应归还中国，而且事实上台湾已在日本投降后归还了中国。但是美国背弃了国际义务，于一九五○年武装侵占台湾，现在又企图利用同蒋介石卖国集团缔结“条约”的办法，“无限期有效”地占领台湾。“条约”第七条公然规定“中华民国政府给予，美利坚合众国接受，依共同协议之决定在台湾、澎湖及其附近为防卫所需要而部署美国陆海空军之权利。”谁都知道，中国人民早已推翻了蒋介石的万恶统治，建立了伟大的中华人民共和国，中华人民共和国政府是中国人民唯一合法的政府。蒋介石卖国集团这样一副腐臭了的政治僵尸已成了美国侵略中国的工具。它出卖祖国领土主权已经是罪大恶极，美国侵略者利用同它签订的“条约”侵占台湾，更是破坏一切国际法规的强盗行动。中国人民决不能容忍美国这种明目张胆地掠夺中国领土、侵犯中国主权的侵略行为。
    杜勒斯所谓美蒋“条约”是“纯防御性的”的说法完全是谎言。美蒋“条约”的第二条和第五条公然规定美国将不惜以战争赌博来干涉中国的内政，阻挠中国人民解放台湾和澎湖列岛。不仅如此，这个“条约”还公然鼓励蒋介石卖国贼侵犯大陆来挑起大战。美蒋“条约”第二条第五条所包涵的武装侵略范围，根据第六条的规定，还“将适用于经共同协议所决定之其他领土”。美英反动舆论这几天来忙于为美国侵略者掩饰和欺骗人民，他们硬说条约是为了和平。但“条约”中的这句话却打了他们一个响亮的嘴巴。事实上，美国侵略集团的战争阴谋明显得很。杜勒斯公开叫嚣说“条约规定了美国在台湾的基地权利”，美国“必须可以自由动员它的部队……进行报复”。杜勒斯还说“这个条约将成为美国同太平洋地区的其他国家已经缔结的各种集体防御条约所建立的集体安全体系中的另一个环节”。他说“这些安排合在一起构成西太平洋自由国家人民抵御共产党侵略的‘中心体制’”。世人皆知，并没有任何国家侵略美国，侵害美国的安全，反倒是美国在到处强占别国的领土为军事基地，并企图把全世界的海洋都变成美国的内湖。另一方面，苏联、中国和人民民主国家却是一贯努力谋求和平、主张互不侵犯、互不干涉内政等五项原则。因此，侵略究竟来自何方，世界公正人士和广大人民已有答案。杜勒斯所谓的“防御”“安全”和“抵御共产党侵略”等等，无非是学希特勒的办法来掩饰他们的战争政策，这还不清楚吗？从这个
  “条约”的条文来看，从杜勒斯的这些话来看，美国企图把美蒋“条约”和东南亚侵略集团以及策划中的“东北亚联盟”和其他军事条约联结在一起，扩大对中国和亚洲的侵略，准备把一些美国的追随者拖入军事冒险中去，挑起战争，这还不明显吗？由此可见，美蒋“条约”是一个彻头彻尾的准备侵略战争的“条约”。
    杜勒斯公然表示，如果美国对中华人民共和国发动挑衅进攻的话“从技术上说并不构成战争”，因为“战争状态只存在于两个互相承认的政府之间”。这实际上就是为美国侵略者随时以任何借口发动对中国的侵略战争立下了逃避法律罪责的借口。但是这种借口是毫无用处的。美国侵略者这种横蛮做法完全是承继了日本军国主义者过去侵略中国的陈旧衣钵。人们知道，日本军国主义者过去侵占我国的东北作为基地时，就说它的侵略“并不构成战争”。而在一九三七年向中国大举进攻之际，也说他们对中国的侵略“并不构成战争”，因为不是处于“战争状态”。日本军国主义者侵略中国和亚洲各国的惨痛教训，中国人民和亚洲各国人民至今记忆犹新。美国侵略者竟敢于认为中国人民会忘记了这种历史教训，它竟以为伟大中华人民共和国六亿人民可以欺侮，亚洲和世界爱好和平人民可以蒙蔽，那他们就大错而特错了。如果美国侵略者一定坚决要走日本军国主义的老路，那么，这一次要受到历史的沉重鞭打的仍不会是中国人民，而是疯狂的美国侵略者。
    美国侵略者一面强占中国的领土，准备对中国的侵略战争，另一方面竟企图把联合国宪章来作为他们的罪恶野心的掩饰。美蒋战争条约的序言在一开头就毫无羞耻地说：美蒋“重申其对联合国宪章之宗旨与原则之信心”。这种鬼话只能被认为是对联合国宪章的最大的嘲讽和污辱。体现了各国爱好和平人民意志的联合国宪章，明确地规定了它的宗旨和原则是维持国际和平及安全，并且规定不许任何国家侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整和政治独立。然而，美蒋战争条约既然明目张胆地侵犯了中国的领土，并且是以准备对中国的大规模的侵略战争为目的，这就露骨地违反了联合国宪章的上述庄严规定。美国侵略者无论如何都推卸不了他们破坏联合国宪章的可耻的罪行的。
    事实很显然，美蒋条约的签订势必引起远东和亚洲局势的恶化。美国侵略者和蒋介石卖国集团的进一步勾结不但是对中国人民严重的战争挑衅，而且也威胁着远东和亚洲各国的安全。目前台湾问题已成为维护远东和亚洲和平的关键问题。一切真正愿望和平的国家和人民，对美国侵略者侵占中国领土台湾、破坏远东和平、准备新的侵略战争的做法都不应该熟视无睹。对战争政策的忍耐和纵容就是对世界和平的危害。历史已经无数次的教训了我们。人们在这样的关头必须有所选择。
    面对着美国侵略集团公开进行战争挑衅的局势，英国政府却对美国这种作法采取支持的态度。英国政府一方面承认中华人民共和国是中国的合法政府；另一面却又公然支持美国侵略集团侵占我国领土台湾，公然认为中国的叛徒和卖国贼可以窃据台湾，这不仅是道义所不能容，而且也违反了国际关系的准则。十二月一日，英国外交部发言人就美蒋签订战争“条约”发表谈话说，很久以来，英国政府对美蒋战争“条约”的谈判“一直获悉一般情况，并且就远东一般局势同美国政府经常保持接触。”美国方面又说“条约”本文早已给英国看过。这就证明美蒋战争“条约”的缔结不但得到了英国政府的同意，而且英国政府还参与其事。英国发言人还说台湾存在有所谓“未来的地位”问题，主张这个“地位必须为直接有关各方所接受，并且必须同他们磋商。”谁都知道，英国这句话显然是指所谓“台湾中立化”或者“台湾独立国”。可是，台湾的地位早就确定，台湾在过去、现在、未来永远是中国的领土。现在的问题，只是制止美国武装侵占台湾，反对美国干涉中国内政，撤走美国武装力量。中国人民决不容许用所谓台湾“中立化”或者“独立国”的办法来侵占台湾。这是十分明显的事。
    中国要解放台湾的正义立场英国是知道的，它这种态度显然是明知故犯，甘心不顾它自己的利益追随美国对中国人民采取不友好的态度，而且违背英国在“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”中担承的国际义务。英国应该记得二十三年以前日本对我国东北的侵略是怎样发展成为世界战争的。那时候，连英国也遭到严重的损害。难道英国政府今天还在追随美国战争政策来重复这种经验吗？难道谁还能再认为今天伟大的中国人民是可以被作为对美国侵略政策的牺牲品吗？外国帝国主义决定中国事务的时代已经一去不复返了，谁不想正视这样的铁一般的事实，谁就要犯天大的错误。
    必须指出，有一些人承认台湾是中国的领土，也承认中国人民解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团是中国的内政。但对美国侵占中国领土台湾和蓄意以武力阻挠中国人民解放台湾的行为却默然不置一词。他们错误地认为中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争将会造成紧张局势。这实际上就是想以牺牲中国的领土主权，牺牲中国人民的利益，特别是在台湾的中国人民的利益，来屈从于美国的侵略行为，其结果只能是对美国侵略政策和战争政策的纵容。历史上也有过这种对侵略别国的行为采取默认态度的做法。但是这恰恰使侵略战争扩大以致造成第二次世界战争，连默认侵略者也深受其害。中国人民特别深切地了解这一点。中国人民主张和平，曾用一切办法来谋取和平。但是，中国人民从自己反抗帝国主义侵略的斗争中用光辉的事实证明，只有坚决地击败侵略，捍卫祖国的安全、主权和领土完整，而决不能拿牺牲自己的国家主权和人民的利益去乞求和平，更不能拿默认和听任美国肆行侵略的办法来使和平遭受危害和破坏。必须制止侵略，才能保障和平。因此，中国人民对美蒋签订的战争条约决不能置之不理。
    中国人民解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，正是为了我国和一切国家的主权领土不可侵犯，为了保卫我国和各国人民的切身利益，也就是为了保卫远东和世界和平。这个真理是极为明显的，接受这个真理，坚决反对美国的侵略行为，就会对世界和平事业作出很大的贡献。
    台湾是中国的领土，解放台湾、保卫祖国主权和领土完整，是中国政府和人民坚定不移的政策，是我们神圣的责任。任何外国干涉都不能阻止中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和澎湖列岛的决心。任何恫吓和威胁都不能丝毫动摇中国人民保卫自己的主权和领土、保卫和平的坚强意志和行动。中国人民必须以不可动摇的意志，更紧密地团结一致，加倍努力，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团而坚决斗争到底。中国人民不解放台湾，决不罢休。如果美国侵略集团，竟敢于进一步来实行武装干涉，那么，美国政府必须负起一切严重后果的责任。
