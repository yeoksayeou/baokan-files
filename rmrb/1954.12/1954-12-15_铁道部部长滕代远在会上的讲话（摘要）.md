I am very happy to participate in this meeting to celebrate the completion of the Jining-Erlian railway track laying fourteen days ahead of schedule. Please allow me, on behalf of the Ministry of Railways, to extend warm congratulations to all the staff and workers and all the civilian laborers who overcame various difficulties and completed the track laying task ahead of schedule, to express heartfelt thanks to the people of the whole country, especially the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, for their strong support to the Jining-Erlian railway, and to express sincere thanks to the Soviet experts who enthusiastically helped build the Jining-Erlian railway.

The Jining-Erlian railway is one of China's major international trunk lines. It will connect with a section within the People's Republic of Mongolia and organize joint transportation. After the completion of this railway, the distance from Beijing via Ulaanbaatar to Moscow will be more than 1,000 kilometers shorter than via Manchuria to Moscow, which greatly shortens the distance of railway transportation between China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia. After the completion of this railway, it will further promote economic and cultural exchanges between China, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe, and promote the common high tide of the economies of fraternal countries.

This railway plays an important role in China's socialist construction. After the completion of the Jining-Erlian railway, it will be more convenient to import equipment for large industrial enterprises from the Soviet Union, which will help China's socialist industrialization.

This railway plays a great role in the economic development and improvement of people's lives in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Before liberation, due to inconvenient transportation, farmers and herdsmen could not sell their products, and even if they did, the prices were very low. For example, in the Ulanhada area, before liberation, one sheep could only be exchanged for a piece of brick tea. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the lives of the people of Inner Mongolia have been greatly improved. Now that this railway has been built, it can further prosper the economy of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and improve the people's lives. Although only a section of the Jining-Erlian railway is currently operating on a temporary basis, it has shown a significant role in developing the local economy and improving people's lives. After the temporary opening of the Jining-Erlian railway south of Wundurmiao, from January to November this year, more than 300 tons of timber were transported to the local area, and a large number of furs and livestock were transported out. In the past, it was difficult for Mongolian people to buy cloth, but now it can be transported in large quantities by train. Many Mongolian people had never seen a movie before, but now they can watch movies when the railway construction workers show movies. Jining was still a town of 30,000 people in 1953, but it has prospered during the construction of the Jining-Erlian railway and has now grown to more than 60,000 people.

The construction of this railway will not only promote the prosperity of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, but also further strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups. Therefore, it can be said that the Jining-Erlian railway is a railway of peace, democracy, and unity.

The reason why the Jining-Erlian railway was able to complete the track laying task ahead of schedule is the result of the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao; it is the result of the hard work of all the staff, workers, and civilian laborers who participated in the surveying, design, and construction; at the same time, it is inseparable from the strong support of the people of the whole country and the people of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and it is inseparable from the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts.

In the process of building this railway, all the railway construction workers and civilian laborers carried forward the spirit of patriotism and the spirit of hard struggle, and overcame many difficulties with high labor enthusiasm and creativity. The climate in many areas along the Jining-Erlian railway is very cold, and the temperature in the coldest places is more than 30 degrees Celsius below zero. Winter lasts for five months of the year. During winter construction, some civilian laborers took out the quilts they had covered themselves with to cover culverts; the workers of the mechanized railway construction team took off their leather coats and covered the water tanks of the machines; when the track spiking team was spiking the track to Erlian, the temperature dropped to 37 degrees Celsius below zero, and the workers said: the weather is cold, but our hearts are warm. They persisted in construction in the severe cold to ensure that the rails were laid to the junction point on the Sino-Mongolian border ahead of schedule. There was a lack of water in the section of the Jining-Erlian railway 174 kilometers north, and the staff and workers relied on local herdsmen to find water sources, and they came up with many ways to save water. In some areas, they melted snow into water, and a basin of water was used five or six times.

The help of Soviet experts to us is meticulous. The Soviet experts of the Ministry of Railways provided specific guidance on this road from surveying and design to the entire construction process, and they put forward more than 100 suggestions in the construction, which have had good results after implementation.

Comrades of staff, workers, and civilian laborers, you have completed the task of laying the main line of the Jining-Erlian railway fourteen days ahead of schedule, which is a great achievement. However, your future tasks are still very arduous. Most of the stations and yards on the Jining-Erlian railway have not yet been built. The length of these station lines is about equal to half the length of the entire line from Jining to Erlian. Since this railway is a major international trunk line, it requires higher technical standards. After the track is laid to Erlian, it is necessary to strengthen the maintenance and repair of the line, gradually improve the quality of the line, and adapt to the needs of future joint transportation. Therefore, you must not be satisfied with the existing achievements, but continue to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, work diligently, and strive to complete all construction projects ahead of schedule and ensure that joint transportation is organized on schedule.

    铁道部部长滕代远在会上的讲话（摘要）
    我很高兴地参加了这个大会，来庆祝集二线提前十四天完成铺轨任务。请允许我代表铁道部向克服各种困难、提前完成铺轨任务的勘测、设计和施工的全体职工和全体民工表示热烈祝贺，向大力支援集二线的全国人民、特别是内蒙古自治区的各族人民表示衷心感谢，向热诚帮助修建集二线的苏联专家们表示诚恳感谢。
    集二线是我国主要的国际干线之一，它将和蒙古人民共和国境内的一段接轨，并组织联运。这条铁路修成以后，从北京经过乌兰巴托到莫斯科，比经过满洲里到莫斯科要近一千多公里，这就大大地缩短了中、苏、蒙三国在铁路运输上的距离。这条铁路修成以后，将进一步促进中、苏、蒙三国及东欧各人民民主国家的经济和文化交流，促进各兄弟国家经济的共同高涨。
    这条铁路对我国社会主义建设具有重大作用。集二线建成以后，从苏联输入大工业企业的设备就更方便了，这就有助于我国的社会主义工业化事业。
    这条铁路对内蒙古自治区经济发展和人民生活的改善有很大的作用。解放以前，由于交通不便，农牧民的产品卖不出去，即便卖出去，价钱也很低，例如乌兰哈达一带解放前一只羊只换到一块砖茶。解放以后，内蒙人民在共产党和人民政府领导下，生活有很大改善，现在修建了这条铁路，就可以更进一步繁荣内蒙古自治区的经济和提高人民生活。虽然目前集二线还只有一段线路开办临时营业，但它对发展当地经济和改善人民生活已显示了重大作用。集二线温都尔庙以南开办临时营业后，从今年一月到十一月，为地方运送了木材三百多吨，运出了大批皮毛和牲畜。过去蒙族人民很难买到布匹，现在可以由火车大批运来了。许多蒙族人民过去从来没有见到过电影，现在他们能够在筑路职工放映电影时看到电影。集宁在一九五三年还是一个三万人的镇市，在修筑集二线的过程中已经繁荣起来了，现在已经发展到六万多人。
    这条铁路的修筑，不仅能促进内蒙古自治区的繁荣，而且将进一步加强各民族的团结。因此，完全可以这样说：集二线是和平的民主团结的铁路。
    集二线所以能够提前完成铺轨任务，是党中央和毛主席英明领导的结果；是参加勘测、设计和施工的全体职工和民工辛勤劳动的结果；同时，和全国人民、内蒙古自治区人民的大力支援是分不开的，和苏联专家的热诚帮助是分不开的。
    在修筑这条铁路的过程中，全体筑路职工和民工发扬了爱国主义的精神和艰苦奋斗的精神，以高度的劳动积极性和创造性，克服了很多困难。集二线上许多地区气候很冷，最冷的地方气温在摄氏零下三十多度。一年当中冬季达五个月之久。在冬季施工中，有的民工把自己盖的被子拿出来盖涵管；机械筑路队的工人把自己穿的皮衣从身上脱下来盖在机器的水箱上；钉道队工人在钉道到二连的时候，气温降低到摄氏零下三十七度，工人说：天是冷的，心是热的。他们在严寒中坚持施工，保证提前把钢轨铺到了中蒙边境接轨点。集二线上一百七十四公里以北一段水源缺乏，职工们依靠当地牧民找到了水源，并想了许多节省水的办法，有的地区把雪化成水，一盆水连用五、六次之多。
    苏联专家对我们的帮助是无微不至的。铁道部苏联专家对这一条路从勘测设计到施工的整个过程中都做了具体指导，他们并在施工中提出了一百多条建议，实行以后都发生了良好的效果。
    职工和民工同志们，你们提前十四天完成了集二线正线铺轨任务，这是一件很大的成就。但是你们今后的任务还是非常艰巨的，集二线大部分站场还没有修建起来，这些站线的长度大约相等于从集宁到二连的全线长度的一半。由于这条铁路是一条主要的国际干线，在技术标准上要求较高，铺轨到二连以后，还要加强线路的养护和维修工作，逐步提高线路的质量，并适应将来组织联运的需要。因此，你们决不能满足已有的成绩，还要继续发扬艰苦奋斗精神，兢兢业业地工作，为争取提前完成全部修建工程、保证按期组织联运而奋斗。
