Resolutely Oppose the US-Chiang Treaty, We Must Liberate Taiwan

    Since the signing of the war treaty between US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, our newspaper's vast readership has sent letters expressing their immense anger, resolutely opposing the US-Chiang war treaty, determined to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and absolutely not allowing any country to interfere. Excerpts from some of the letters are published below:

    Use the practical action of increasing production and practicing economy to support the just struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    A letter from all employees of the Shenyang Electrical Machinery Plant: We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times, and Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor, is a public enemy of the Chinese people. Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is entirely China's sovereignty and internal affair, and no foreign interference is allowed. Now the United States has blatantly signed a so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to protect this political corpse, to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and attempting to expand its aggression against China. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. All employees of our plant are determined to use practical actions to oppose the US-Chiang treaty, guarantee the completion of our plant's seventy-two product tasks, and increase production and save the country 8.55 billion yuan by the end of the year to support the just struggle to liberate Taiwan!

    We must strengthen our work in all aspects to enable the people of Taiwan to be liberated as soon as possible.

    A letter from Guo Yu'en of Pingshun County, Shanxi Province: Just as all members of our agricultural production cooperative were celebrating the harvest and selling surplus grain to the state, the radio broadcast Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The members immediately held a forum, and everyone unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn statement and expressed great anger at this shameful war treaty between the US and Chiang. Now the entire cooperative has sold more than 40,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, and twenty-four young people have voluntarily signed up for military service, determined to rush to the post of defending the motherland. In order to allow the people of Taiwan to live a free and peaceful life of labor like us as soon as possible, we must strengthen our work in all aspects. Now we have decided to do the following practical work: First, use blackboard newspapers and reading groups to publicize the task of opposing the US-Chiang treaty and liberating Taiwan to the peasant masses; second, do a good job in winter production; third, continue to improve management and increase production efficiency; fourth, guarantee that each mu of land will increase production by another twenty-five jin of grain next year; the entire cooperative will sell 60,000 jin of surplus grain to the state; fifth, do a good job in preferential treatment and substitute farming.

    Grasp the weapons in our hands and strictly guard the motherland's coastal defense, ready to dedicate our strength to the liberation of Taiwan.

    A letter from Zheng Yaguang, a soldier of a certain unit on the Fujian front line of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: After I saw the news in the newspaper that the United States had signed a so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, I felt extremely angry. I resolutely oppose this aggressive treaty and war treaty between the US and Chiang. I am a soldier on the front line of coastal defense. I guarantee that I will be more vigilant in the future, work and study hard, grasp the weapons in my hands, and work with my comrades to strictly guard the motherland's coastal defense, and resolutely contribute everything to the liberation of Taiwan, the motherland's inalienable territory.

    If the aggressors dare to provoke a new war, they will surely be resolutely countered by the Chinese people.

    A letter from Liu Yiguang of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: I fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" and resolutely support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions. The war treaty signed between the US and Chiang will absolutely not scare the Chinese people who have been tempered into steel. On the contrary, it will only arouse greater anger from the Chinese people. Defending the motherland, liberating Taiwan, and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique are our responsibilities. If the aggressors are obsessed and insist on imposing war on the Chinese people, then we will give them a resolute counterattack!

    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn statement expressed the will of all the Chinese people.

    A letter from the Student Union of Beijing Aviation Institute: Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" once again expressed the Chinese people's firm will to oppose aggression and liberate Taiwan. All the students of our Beijing Aviation Institute resolutely support this just statement. In order to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions, we guarantee: Study hard every course, master the knowledge of aviation science, actively study political affairs, carry out labor and defense sports, and cultivate ourselves into all-round developed red aviation engineers, to defend and build the motherland and contribute all our strength.

    坚决反对美蒋条约，一定要解放台湾
    自从美国帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团签订了战争条约以来，本报广大读者纷纷来信表示无比的愤怒，坚决反对美蒋的战争条约，一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，决不容许任何国家来干涉，现选摘一部分来信发表如下：
    用增产节约的实际行动支援解放台湾的正义斗争
    沈阳电工机械厂全体职工来信：我们坚决拥护我国外交部长周恩来关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明。台湾自古就是中国的领土，蒋介石卖国贼是中国人民的公敌。解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，完全是中国的主权和内政，决不容许任何外国干涉。现在美国公然同蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓
  “共同防御条约”，企图庇护这一具政治僵尸，来阻挠中国人民解放台湾，并企图扩大侵略中国，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。我们全厂职工决心用实际行动来反对美蒋条约，保证完成我厂七十二种产品任务，到年底要给国家增产节约八十五亿五千万元财富，以支援解放台湾的正义斗争！
    我们要从各方面来加强工作使台湾人民早日得到解放
    山西平顺县郭玉恩来信：正当我们农业生产合作社全体社员欢庆丰收，将余粮卖给国家的时候，收音机里传来周外长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明。社员们立刻举行了座谈，大家一致拥护周外长这一严正的声明，并对美蒋这一可耻的战争条约表示了极大的愤怒。现在全社已卖给国家余粮四万多斤，并有二十四个青年自动报名应征服兵役，坚决奔向保卫祖国的岗位。为了让台湾人民早日和我们一样过自由的和平劳动生活，我们要从各方面来加强工作。现在我们决定做好下面几项实际工作：第一，通过黑板报、读报组向农民群众宣传反对美蒋条约，解放台湾的斗争任务；第二，做好冬季生产的工作；第三，继续改善经营管理，提高生产效率；第四，保证明年每亩土地再增产二十五斤粮食；全社卖给国家余粮六万斤；第五，做好优抚代耕工作。
    紧握手中武器严守祖国海防准备为解放台湾而献出力量
    中国人民解放军福建前线某部战士郑亚光来信：我在报纸上看到美国同蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”的消息后，感到无比的愤怒。我坚决反对美蒋这个侵略条约和战争条约。我是一个在海防最前线上的战士，我保证今后更加提高警惕，努力工作和学习，紧握手中武器，和同志们一道严守祖国的海防，坚决地为解放祖国不可分割的领土——台湾而贡献自己的一切力量。
    如果侵略者胆敢挑起新战争必将遭到中国人民的坚决回击
    中国人民解放军某部刘贻光来信：我完全拥护周外长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，坚决用实际行动支援解放台湾的斗争。美蒋签订的战争条约绝对吓不倒百炼成钢的中国人民，相反地只能引起中国人民的更大愤怒。保卫祖国、解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团是我们的责任。如果侵略者执迷不悟，硬要把战争强加在中国人民头上，那么，我们将给它以坚决的回击！
    周恩来外长的严正声明表达了全中国人民的意志
    北京航空学院学生会来信：周外长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，再一次表达了中国人民反对侵略和解放台湾的坚强意志，我们北京航空学院的全体同学坚决拥护这个正义的声明。为了用实际行动支援解放台湾的斗争，我们保证：努力学好每一门功课，切实掌握航空科学的知识，积极学习政治时事，开展劳卫制锻炼运动，把自己培养成为全面发展的红色航空工程师，为保卫和建设祖国而贡献出一切力量。
