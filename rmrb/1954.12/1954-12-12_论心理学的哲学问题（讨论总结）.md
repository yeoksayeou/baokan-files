Editor's Note: Starting in March 1952, the Soviet magazine "Problems of Philosophy" launched a discussion on psychology; after more than two years, "Problems of Philosophy" published a summary of this discussion. This summary criticized the erroneous tendencies in psychological research, pointed out the correct path for psychology based on Marxist philosophical principles, emphasized the importance of correctly applying Pavlov's theory to psychology, and answered questions such as whether psychology has class character, and the object and methods of psychology. The original text was long and was abridged after translation.

On the Philosophical Problems of Psychology (Discussion Summary)
Soviet psychologists, in solving the theoretical problems of psychology, proceed from the principles of Marxist philosophy. This primarily involves the profound and well-founded scientific concept that consciousness is an attribute of highly organized matter and a product of brain activity.

Soviet psychology also established the definition that consciousness is the reflection of matter by the human brain. However, although psychologists generally want to follow dialectical materialism to study psychological phenomena, they still cannot properly and creatively apply Marxist philosophy, and they still cannot eliminate backward phenomena in psychology. Psychologists have put forward extremely contradictory arguments regarding the object of psychology and the relationship between psychology and physiology. This was particularly evident at the psychology conference held by the Presidium of the Russian Soviet Education Academy in the summer of 1952.

At the Second Soviet Psychology Conference (July 1953), the question of the object of psychology was raised again due to the discussion of the psychology textbook outline, but a resolution satisfactory to the scientific community was still not reached.

The papers published in the magazine "Problems of Philosophy" also prove that there are serious differences of opinion in solving psychological problems.

What are the reasons for the difficulties in solving the theoretical problems of psychology? Undoubtedly, a large part of this is determined by the complexity of the object of psychology. Lack of criticism and self-criticism is also an obstacle.

Some Soviet physiologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists, influenced by foreign reactionary schools, are groundlessly obsessed with the anti-scientific concepts of Freud's theory, obsessed with the "theories" of brain pathology, and stubbornly advocating so-called psychotechnics, saying that it is the key to revealing people's talents, abilities, etc. However, psychotechnics, like the notorious pedology and Freudianism, is essentially a manifestation of the anti-scientific racist views that are widely used by imperialist colonial policies.

There are various serious distortions and incorrect tendencies in the works of psychologists. The most serious and harmful mistake is to underestimate the significance of Pavlov's theory of higher nervous activity in humans and animals.

Some psychologists believe that the science of psychology is only related to Pavlov's physiology in a certain way, and it should be based on another foundation—sociology. They underestimated the profound scientific and historical significance of Pavlov's shift to the study of higher nervous activity in humans. In addition, the work done by Pavlov's "disciples" in applying Pavlov's scientific achievements was extremely bad. They violated the warnings of this great scientist and dogmatically applied everything he determined to animals to humans. Thus, while intolerably biologizing the explanation of psychological phenomena, they underestimated and vulgarized Pavlov's theory. Advocating the notorious reflexology, as if this were Pavlov's theory of human behavior, is precisely the denial of what is unique to human beings, the denial of Pavlov's psychology. The "left-wing" abolitionists of psychology have united with the reflexologists (which can be said to be the right-wing abolitionists of psychology). They vulgarly and anti-Marxistly discussed the social and historical constraints on human occurrence and development. They confused the problem of human individual consciousness with the problem of social consciousness and social class consciousness, and almost regarded human beings themselves as a function of unsubstantial social relations, as a totality of abstract social categories. Based on this, they tried their best to belittle Pavlov's theory.

This kind of distortion greatly hindered the development of psychology, harmed the study of theoretical problems of psychology, and also hindered the achievements that should be achieved in the practical application of psychology. The joint meeting of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences to discuss Pavlovian physiology played a certain role in transforming psychology. However, the realization of this transformation is still extremely slow.

Individual psychologists and even philosophers equate psychological phenomena with physiological phenomena, and they are now studying psychological problems from a very harmful abolitionist standpoint. They advocate that scientific psychology can be merged with the physiology of higher nervous activity, saying that the latter is forming into a science for studying the brain's reflective work of animals and humans. They believe that psychology has lost its object, so it is meaningless for psychology to exist as a special science.

In contrast, some psychologists follow the path of idealism and completely deny the significance of Pavlov's theory for understanding psychological processes. Those scholars who refuse to apply physiology to the study of psychological phenomena destroy the scientific basis of psychology, which will also lead to the abolition of the science of psychology, because the psychological thing is no longer evaluated as the function of the human brain. They argue that psychological activity is something that cannot be compared with nervous activity, and that Pavlov's reflex theory is of no significance for understanding psychological activity. They say that the psychological thing is a special phenomenon that is fundamentally opposed to the nerve process.

The serious error of these two criticized concepts lies in the fact that they will both lead to the denial of psychological cognizability. One is because the task of psychological research itself is eliminated due to the denial of the psychological thing. The other is because the psychological thing is opposed to the work of the brain, making the psychological thing a mysterious phenomenon beyond the limits of scientific understanding. Thus, those intentional or unintentional supporters of agnosticism have become opponents of Academician Pavlov's profound and correct views. Pavlov has always pointed out the significance of physiology for understanding psychological phenomena, and at the same time, he has never denied the necessity of psychology as an independent science. Obviously, the above two positions are wrong and should be discarded as things that hinder the correct development of psychological science.

Some psychologists also mistakenly dissolve the psychological thing into the physiological thing, replace dialectical materialism with vulgar materialism, and then distort and vulgarize Marxist philosophy.

Those who advocate abolishing the physiological basis of psychology and those who oppose the psychological thing to the physiological thing are standing on the standpoint of idealism and dualism.

Those who unilaterally advocate that psychology is a science about people's social and political behavior, a science about people's way of thinking and social development, until the establishment of people's conscious views, inevitably want to separate psychology from physiology. Thus, the same result is obtained: From this point of view, it is obviously not necessary to apply Pavlov's theory. Needless to say, similar sociological views not only cannot help the development of psychological science, but will only hinder the development of psychology. Therefore, in essence, this is also an attitude of psychological abolitionism.

Marxism teaches that there is absolutely no special psychological process that can be carried out without material nerve processes.

Lenin determined that the scientific path for studying psychology is to study "the material entity of psychological phenomena, namely, nerve processes." (See Lenin's Selected Works, Volume 1, Moscow Chinese Edition, page 102.) From this, it can be concluded that the nerve process is the body of psychological phenomena. Therefore, nerve processes and psychological phenomena cannot be confused with each other.

Pavlov dedicated his decades of creative activity to the study of nerve processes. He discovered the laws of higher nervous activity in animals and humans, and when determining the characteristics of higher nervous activity in humans, he put forward the task of connecting physiological phenomena with psychological phenomena. Following Pavlov's physiological theory of animals and humans, it is very necessary to distinguish between "higher nervous activity in animals" and "higher nervous activity in humans." Human higher nervous activity is a kind of special nervous activity, just as the human brain mechanism adapted to this special nervous activity is different in nature from the brain mechanism of animals. It should be emphasized that, with the help of Pavlov's theory, especially the concept of two signal systems, it is possible for the first time in the history of physiology to study human higher nervous activity as a social substance. Researchers enter a new and different field from this key point.

The historical significance of Pavlov's works lies in his revealing the laws of higher nervous activity and laying the foundation for scientific psychology. But as pointed out above, the task of psychology should not be regarded as analyzing and explaining psychological phenomena from the viewpoint of general higher nervous activity, regardless of whether it refers to the higher nervous activity of animals or the higher nervous activity of humans.

What we are referring to should not be general higher nervous activity, but human higher nervous activity, not the general physiological processes that characterize the work activities of the brain that are inherent in even animals (inhibition, excitation, induction, diffusion, concentration, etc.), but the characteristics of the work and its structure and function of the human brain, and it must be applied to the course of psychological actions (for example: temporary connections, that is, associations; trace reactions, that is, memory phenomena, etc.) to determine its objective regularity of occurrence and development. In fact, only under these conditions does psychology have the right to exist independently; that is, the object of psychology research has its own uniqueness, and this science itself can reveal the laws of psychological phenomena inherent to humans. Everything described above can be used to determine the different characteristics of psychology and physiology.

Psychology should study people, study specific physiological existences, although this existence is socially constrained. People act historically as social physical individuals, not as embodiments of insubstantial social relations. Marx wrote: "People have a history because they must produce their own lives, and they are based on established methods. This, like their consciousness, is constrained by their physiological structure." ("The German Ideology," the last sentence of the quotation is emphasized by the original editor.)

Not only determining the connection between human (people's) consciousness and social consciousness, but also determining the difference between the two is of great significance for defining the object of the science of psychology. We are not to oppose them, but to distinguish them. This is primarily because the problems of psychology have often been confused with ideological problems and problems of social consciousness forms, which is detrimental to the development of scientific psychology. Human consciousness is the object of psychology, but the study of social consciousness belongs to the field of historical materialism and other social sciences. The study of social consciousness and its formation and development laws is not carried out by psychology, but by historical materialism.

In this way, the object of psychology is the consciousness of people (people) as social biological existences, first of all, psychological activities.

Consciousness is not only thinking. The spiritual realm of human activity—psychological activity—also includes volition, emotions, feelings, representations, and other cognitive processes.

Consciousness is a tool for people to connect with each other and with the surrounding reality, a tool for people to orient themselves in the world, and a result of reflecting and understanding the world.

But people not only reflect the world in psychological activities. They also act on the world. The initiative and activeness of people are the creative manifestations of their consciousness. Therefore, studying people's activeness (in which consciousness plays a guiding role) has become one of the important tasks of psychology. At the same time, it should be remembered that the general basis of human activities and their consciousness. Both human activities and their consciousness are determined by the historical characteristics of the mode of production.

Ultimately, the mode of production (people's relationship with natural forces and people's relationship with each other) determines the characteristics of people's psychological life. People's consciousness adapts to the nature of this mode of production, performing a dual role—dual, interconnected functions: consciousness is a tool for people to communicate and determine their theoretical and practical relationship with nature. At the same time, people act on nature—the struggle between people and natural forces has helped people separate themselves from the animal kingdom.

In order to determine the characteristics of the object of psychology, special attention must also be paid to the following question: From the perspective of the content of consciousness, is studying the inner world of people the object of psychology? Of course, this is a question of psychology, but everyone knows very well that the application of historical materialism is essential to researching this problem, and that it is necessary to turn to the study of social and historical questions. Within the scope of psychology, it is possible and should be to discuss many issues related to the spiritual world of people in accordance with historical materialism, and this is a particularly important part of great practical significance. This part can be called the psychology of personality. But the problem of personality psychology is closely related to social sciences and cannot constitute the entire content of psychology. From our point of view, psychology should mainly belong to the field of natural science.

Sometimes psychologists make the entire content of psychological problems subordinate to the study of the personality of people. In this way, the task of transforming psychology in accordance with the direction of Sechenov and Pavlov's theory will be cancelled, and at the same time, Lenin's programmatic instruction that scientific psychology should strive to explain psychological phenomena and should start from the analysis of nerve processes will become an exception as if it were insignificant. This will bring great losses to the cause of transforming psychology. The study of psychological activity seems to be negated, and the personality is only explained from historical materialism.

In addition, the solution to the problem should not be abstract and theoretical; the practice of scientific research on people's personality must be taken into account. In this practice, most of them are simple descriptions and explanations of the external process of things. In general, the result obtained is neither psychology nor the development of historical materialism, is this not very obvious?

Due to the study of the content of individual consciousness, the question of class character in psychology arises.

Acknowledging the class character of psychological activity would logically restore Marr's concept that language and thinking have class character, which has been thoroughly exposed and shattered by Stalin's "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics."

Those class foundations that determine the content of consciousness from many aspects do not determine the nature of the psychological process itself. Psychological processes, the activity of the brain, do not have class character. They have a pan-human nature, and people of different classes, different ethnic groups, and different races are the same. Of course, they also have some individual characteristics, but these characteristics are not less pronounced or more monotonous within the same class, the same ethnic group, and the same race than they are in people of different classes, different ethnic groups, and different races. These individual characteristics do not depend on class character, ethnicity, or race, but on some individual characteristics of people's life activities and living conditions, and also depend on their age characteristics, as well as the state of health, etc., reflected in the nature of psychological activities [Note]. The principle of the pan-human nature of psychology is very important. This principle must be concretely applied to psychological processes such as sensation, perception, and thinking, to emotional processes and to volitional processes. At the same time, however, the study of psychological processes must never be completely separated from people's personality, people's interests, and activity motives (where there may be something with a class foundation). In addition to paying attention to the national commonality of people's psychological qualities, it should also be emphasized that attention must be paid in psychology to the common things in the spiritual life of people of different ethnic groups. It can be seen from this that the problems of psychology are diverse and are by no means limited to the problems of higher nervous activity. Similarly, many problems of human psychology also involve the field of historical materialism; secondly, attention should be paid to the interconnection between the problem of the content of individual consciousness and the specific natural scientific path through which the formation of individual consciousness has gone. Therefore, the object of psychology is a very complex problem. But the object of psychology can still be determined.

So what is the object of the science of psychology?

Psychology is the study of consciousness expressed in human activities and behavior, and consciousness is the reflection existing in the human brain. Psychology faces the subjective world of people and determines the regularity of psychological phenomena. Psychology believes that these phenomena are the processes of higher nervous activity in humans expressed in material form and conscious form.

Psychology is the science of human psychological activities, and psychological activities are the functions of the brain, and are the real reflections expressed in human behavior.

Psychology studies the regularity of psychological phenomena that are caused by reflective processes, cognitive processes (this process is realized by higher nervous activity, the work of the entire human organism), and at the same time express people's attitude towards the reality they reflect (emotional and volitional attitude).

From this, it can be concluded that psychology studies the content aspects of intelligent, emotional, and volitional processes. Psychology, this science of the objective laws of human consciousness, should also study the laws of the interrelationships between various aspects of consciousness (cognitive, emotional, and volitional aspects).

Due to the influence of objective reality and the work of the brain, people can reflect the world in the course of action, and due to the reflection (cognition) of the world, they can act consciously. Therefore, psychology is the study of psychological activities that are closely linked processes (people's cognitive processes - people's action processes).

It must be added that the regularity of thinking and its various forms abstracted from the physiological occurrence of these processes form an independent science - logic - the object, and according to the general basis of epistemology, psychology is close to philosophy.

When studying people, especially when studying people's consciousness, it is necessary to take into account the social and historical laws of human development, but this does not mean that research must go beyond the scope of natural science. To illustrate this point, we can talk about mechanics. As everyone knows, machines are production tools, elements of social productive forces, and therefore, they belong to the ranks of social phenomena. However, when studying the work of machines, the mechanical efficiency of machines, it is necessary to turn to technical sciences and natural sciences, such as mechanics, physics, and not to political economy or other social disciplines.

Secondly, we should talk about the attitude towards psychological terminology.

Pavlov did not think it was necessary to deny the traditional evaluation of psychological phenomena such as intelligence, emotion, and will. Pavlov applied concepts such as association, sensation, impression, memory, representation, and attention as legitimate concepts within psychology. Pavlov opposed the application of psychological terminology to explain the work of the brain from a physiological point of view, but he applied these psychological terminologies to mark psychological phenomena. This view was led to some nihilistic inclinations by us in the cause of so-called re-evaluation and re-examination of psychological terminology and concepts in accordance with Pavlov's physiology.

Similarly, some higher nervous activity processes (reflex connections, excitation processes and inhibition processes, diffusion and concentration, positive and negative induction, etc.) can cause or will cause various different results in these processes and the different interrelationships of brain structures, in different systems, and in different connections, that is, cause various different psychological phenomena. Conversely, various different physiological processes can cause some of the same psychological phenomena (for example, attention is constrained by both the generalization of excitation and the inhibition process). These all prove that psychology has its own specificity.

Similarly, it must be explained that the same psychological phenomena also have their own particularities due to the fact that the same neurophysiological dynamics are associated with different structural areas of the brain (for example, memory is divided into auditory memory and visual memory, etc.). From this, it can be seen that Pavlov's assertion that "the effect of force is distributed in space, the adaptation of dynamics to structure" is of great significance for studying psychological problems.

Studying the influence of the second signal system, which is interconnected with the first signal system, on the formation of consciousness, studying the significance of dynamic stereotypes and their changes in people's psychology, studying the formation and cultivation of people's character under the influence of living conditions and their temperament, etc., not only proves that psychology is closely related to physiology, but also proves that psychologists have special scientific tasks.

At the same time, it must be pointed out that psychology cannot develop correctly if it completely deviates from social sciences. If psychology is divorced from life, if psychologists do not take the laws of social development, the laws of building socialism and communism as the basic pointers, then it is impossible to correctly evaluate psychological phenomena, correctly determine the methods of influencing consciousness, and it is also impossible to correctly cultivate and educate, and implement scientific plans for psychological health measures, etc.

It can be seen that without knowledge of social relations, working conditions, and the nature of people's lives, without knowledge of school work, school teaching plans, students' living systems and workload, and the characteristics of the combination of in-class work and extracurricular work, if one does not conduct in-depth research on issues such as the characteristics of organization and education processes, then it is unfounded to want to solve the problems of child psychology.

In order to scientifically study these psychological problems, it is necessary to understand the scope of social influence that serves as the object of reflection of the human brain. It is also necessary to understand the role of orientation in the diverse activities realized by people.

Psychologists should study social sciences and absorb knowledge of life practice to solve their own problems, but they are basically limited to the scope of natural scientific thought. But if psychology does not have due research on the social foundation and the nature of the influence of the foundation on people's psychology, then it cannot meet modern requirements.

In addition, when studying personality psychology, knowledge of psychological processes is necessary in order to determine the direction on issues related to the formation, development, and change of people's personality.

Psychology is the study of people's subjective world. But it uses objective research methods that have been tested in the practice of scientific development. Pavlov's achievements in the study of higher nervous activity have proved this. But among psychologists there is an idea that objective methods generally deny the materials of self-consciousness, self-observation, etc. This is obviously wrong. This is primarily because they are not good at or unwilling to distinguish between the materialist understanding and the idealist explanation of subjective things. They despise subjective things as something that can only distort reality and cannot obtain objective truth. However, Lenin taught us to remember to regard the subjectivity of psychological phenomena as having objective significance, that is, as reflecting objective reality. When defining sensation, Lenin called sensation a subjective image of the objective world. The subject of cognition does not necessarily lead to the conclusion of falsehood about the human subjective world itself. If the evaluation of subjective states has been tested by practice, if the conclusions obtained are of practical significance as scientific data, then the results of self-observation cannot but have the nature of objective truth. Therefore, it is impossible to agree with the unconditional resolution made by the psychology conference, that "self-observation can neither be considered the primary psychological method nor can it be considered the auxiliary psychological method." Self-observation may be scientific or unscientific. If self-observation is conducted scientifically, then self-observation should not be excluded from the arsenal of scientific methods; if self-observation has the nature of subjectivism, then it must be eliminated from the scientific field. Therefore, the problem lies in how to specifically realize self-observation. Asking questions "in general" - that is, asking questions that affirm or deny self-observation regardless of the nature of self-observation - will only cause tedious and superficial disputes.

Secondly, underestimating subjective things is to distort the Marxist understanding of abstraction process. Marxism always proceeds from real objects and phenomena, and according to this, abstracts from individual things and concrete things. Therefore, it cannot be forgotten that in order to generalize psychological phenomena, we must also pay attention to the consciousness of individuals. There is no psychology that does not belong to a specific subject.

Subjective things—people's psychology—actually exist. Subjective things should be studied with objective methods. But self-observation may also have objective properties. From the perspective of scientific epistemology, it is unfounded to delimit the scope of knowledge and declare that the world of people is incomprehensible even to the subject of knowledge itself. Obviously, all other arguments on this issue are manifestations of agnosticism. Excluding subjective things will encounter reasonable opposition, and will leave the struggle against subjective methods. Therefore, this will never promote, but will hinder the struggle against subjectivism and spiritualism. In accordance with Pavlov and his instructions that we must analyze psychological things, we must not start from subjective things, but must only study higher nervous activity with objective methods. But it was none other than Pavlov who said that the materials of this kind of self-observation consolidated science.

From a philosophical point of view, neglecting subjective things can only lead psychology away from dialectical materialism and to the standpoint of vulgar materialism. This will not only not help, but will hinder the exposure of introspective methods, and hinder the crushing of subjectivism and idealism in psychology.

Soviet scholars are raising the theoretical level of scientific thought and eliminating the situation where psychology lags behind the requirements of Soviet communist construction. This is a glorious task. Strengthening the struggle against bourgeois concepts and strengthening the influence of eliminating the remnants of these concepts are closely related to the completion of this task. [Note] By the way, it can be concluded from this that psychologists, after clearing away pseudoscience—pedology—unfoundedly relaxed the research on the age characteristics of psychology; at the same time, it must be admitted that it is not correct to separate psychologists and psychiatrists, which hinders the use of the most important clinical data in psychology.

### 论心理学的哲学问题（讨论总结）

1954-12-12
第3版()
专栏：

    编者按：从一九五二年三月起，苏联“哲学问题”杂志发动了一次心理学的讨论；经过两年多的时间，“哲学问题”发表了这次讨论的总结。这个总结批评了心理学研究中的错误倾向，根据马克思主义哲学原理指出了心理学的正确道路，强调了正确运用巴甫洛夫学说对心理学的重要性，并且回答了心理学有没有阶级性、心理学的对象和方法等问题。原文较长，译出后曾作了删节。
    论心理学的哲学问题（讨论总结）
    苏联心理学者在解决心理学的理论问题时，是从马克思主义哲学原理出发的。这首先就涉及到关于意识是高度组织起来的物质的属性，是大脑活动的产物这一深刻的有根据的科学概念。
    苏联心理学也确立了意识是人脑对物质的反映这一定义。不过尽管心理学者一般是想遵循着辩证唯物主义去研究心理现象，但他们还不能恰当地创造性地应用马克思主义哲学，还不能肃清心理学中的落后现象。心理学者关于心理学的对象，关于心理学与生理学的联系竟提出了极其矛盾的论断。特别是在一九五二年夏季苏俄教育科学院主席团所召开的心理学会议上，更表现出了这种情形。
    在第二次苏联心理学会议上（一九五三年七月），由于讨论心理学教科书大纲，心理学对象问题又重新被提了出来，但仍未得到一个使科学界满意的决议。
    在“哲学问题”杂志上所发表的论文也同样证明，在解决心理学问题上是存在着严重的意见纷歧的。
    究竟摆在解决心理学理论问题道路上的困难原因何在呢？毫无疑义，这里大部分是由心理学对象的复杂性所决定的。缺乏批评与自我批评也同样是一种阻碍。
    苏联某些生理学者、心理学者、精神病学者，在外国反动学派的影响下，竟毫无根据地醉心于弗洛依德学说的反科学的概念，醉心于大脑病理学的
  “理论”，顽固地鼓吹所谓心理技术学，说它是揭示人的秉赋、能力等等的锁钥。但心理技术学也像臭名昭彰的儿童学和弗洛依德学说一样，实质上是帝国主义殖民政策所广泛利用的那种反科学的种族主义观点的表现。
    在心理学者的许多著作中有种种严重的曲解和不正确的倾向。而最严重、最有害的错误就是轻视巴甫洛夫关于人和动物高级神经活动学说的意义。
    一部分心理学者认为，心理学这门科学仅是以一定的方式与巴甫洛夫的生理学发生联系，它本身却应建立在另一个基础——社会学的基础上。巴甫洛夫之所以转而研究人的高级神经活动是具有深刻的科学历史意义的，但他们对于这一点估价不足。加之巴甫洛夫的那些“门生”在运用巴甫洛夫科学成就上所做的工作又是极端恶劣的，他们违反这位最伟大的科学家的警告，把他所确定的应用于动物的一切东西，教条式地搬到人的身上来。从而他们在不可容忍地把对心理现象的解释加以生物学化的同时，又轻视了并庸俗化了巴甫洛夫的学说。鼓吹臭名昭彰的反射学，仿佛这就是巴甫洛夫关于人的行为的学说，其实恰恰是反射学否认了人类所特有的东西，否认了巴甫洛夫的心理学。心理学的
  “左翼”取消派又与反射学者（可以说这是心理学的右翼取消派）联合起来了。他们庸俗地、反马克思主义地论述了人类发生与发展的社会历史制约性问题，他们把人的个体意识问题与社会意识、社会阶级意识问题混淆起来，几乎把人类本身设想成一种无实体的社会关系机能，设想成抽象的社会范畴的总合。根据这一点，就极力贬低巴甫洛夫的学说。
    这类曲解大大地阻碍了心理学的发展，戕害了心理学理论问题的研究，而且也妨害了在实际应用心理学上所应达到的成就。苏联科学院与苏联医学科学院为讨论巴甫洛夫生理学问题召开的联合会议曾对改造心理学起了某种推动作用。可是这种改造的实现仍然是极其缓慢的。
    个别的心理学者甚至哲学家把心理现象与生理现象混为一谈，他们现在站在十分有害的取消派的立场上来研究心理学问题。他们主张，科学的心理学可以与高级神经活动生理学合并，说后者正在形成为研究动物与人的大脑反映工作的科学，他们认为心理学已经失去了自己的对象，因此心理学作为一种特殊科学而存在是没有意义的。
    与此相反，某些心理学者循着唯心主义的道路，根本否认巴甫洛夫学说对于理解心理过程的意义。那些拒绝应用生理学去研究心理现象的学者们破坏了心理学的科学基础，这同样会导致取消心理学这门科学，因为心理的东西已不再被评价为人脑的机能了。他们主张，心理活动是不能与神经活动相比拟的某种东西，认为巴甫洛夫的反射论对于理解心理活动是没有任何意义的，他们把心理的东西说成是根本与神经过程相对立的一种特殊现象。
    这两种被批判的概念的严重错误就在于，它们都会导致否定心理底可认识性。一种是由于否认了心理的东西，所以就取消了心理研究本身的任务。另一种是因为把心理的东西与大脑的工作对立起来，使心理的东西变成了一种超出科学认识界限的神秘现象。从而那些有意的或无意的不可知论的拥护者便成为巴甫洛夫院士的深刻正确的观点的反对者了。巴甫洛夫始终不渝地指出了生理学对于理解心理现象的意义，同时他从未否认过心理学这一独立科学的必要性。显然，上述两种立场都是错误的，是应当看作阻碍心理科学正确发展的东西而被抛弃掉的。
    某些心理学者又错误地把心理的东西解消为生理的东西，用庸俗的唯物主义偷换辩证唯物主义，进而曲解和庸俗化了马克思主义的哲学。
    那些主张取消心理的生理基础和那些把心理的东西与生理的东西对立起来的人，都是站在唯心主义、二元论的立场上的。
    那些片面主张心理学是关于人们的社会、政治行为的科学，是关于人们的思想方式和社会发展，直到确立人的意识观点的科学的人们，不可避免地要使心理学与生理学分隔开。从而得到了同样的结果：从这种观点出发，显然就没有必要应用巴甫洛夫的学说了。不消说，类似的社会学化的见解不仅不能帮助心理科学向前发展，反而只会妨碍心理学的发展，因此在本质上这同样也是一种对待心理学取消派的态度。
    马克思主义教导说，决没有任何特别的、能够不通过物质的神经过程而进行的心理过程。
    列宁确定了研究心理的科学道路是研究“心理现象的物质本体，即神经过程”。（参阅列宁文选两卷集，第一卷，莫斯科中文版，一○二页。）由此可以得出结论说，神经过程是心理现象的本体。因此神经过程与心理现象是不能彼此混同的。
    巴甫洛夫把自己几十年的创造活动都献给了神经过程的研究。他发现了动物与人底高级神经活动的规律，而且他在确定人的高级神经活动的特点时，提出了把生理现象与心理现象联系起来的任务。遵循巴甫洛夫关于动物与人的生理学说，把
  “动物的高级神经活动”与“人的高级神经活动”区分开来，这是非常必要的。人的高级神经活动是一种性质特殊的神经活动，正如适应着这种特殊神经活动的人底大脑机构在性质上不同于动物的脑的机构一样。应当强调指出，借助巴甫洛夫学说，特别是两种信号系统的概念，在生理学史上破天荒第一次有可能把人的高级神经活动作为社会实质来加以研究。研究者从这一关键出发而进入新的性质不同的领域。
    巴甫洛夫著作的历史意义就在于他揭示了高级神经活动的规律，奠定了科学心理学的基础。但是正像上面所指出的那样，不应当把心理学的任务认为是从一般的高级神经活动的观点出发去分析与解释心理现象，而不管所指的究竟是动物的高级神经活动抑或是人的高级神经活动。
    我们所指的应当不是一般的高级神经活动，而是人的高级神经活动，不是那些表征着连动物都固有的脑的工作活动（抑制、兴奋、诱导、扩散、集中等）的一般生理过程，而是人的大脑的工作及其结构与机能的特点，并且要应用到心理动作的历程上（例如：暂时联系，即联想；痕迹反应，即记忆现象等），以确定其发生与发展的客观规律性。实际上，只有在这种条件下，心理学才有独立存在的权利；即心理学研究的客体有自己的独特性，并且这一科学本身能揭示出人所固有的心理现象的规律的时候。以上所述的一切可供确定心理学与生理学所不同的特点。
    心理学要研究人，研究具体的生理的存在物，虽然这种存在物是由社会制约着的。人在历史上是作为社会的物理个体行动着，而不是作为无实体的社会关系的体现者行动着。马克思写道：“人们是有历史的，因为他们必须要生产自己的生活，而且是依据着既定的方法。这和他们的意识一样，是受
  他们的生理的机构所制约的”。（“德意志意识形态”，引文最末一句重点，为原文编者所加。）
    不仅确定人（人们）的意识与社会意识之间的联系，而且确定二者之间的差别，这对于给心理学这一科学的对象下定义是具有重要意义的。我们不是要把它们对立起来，而是应当把它们区分开来。这首先是因为心理学的问题无论过去和现在都常常与意识形态问题，与社会意识形式问题相混淆，而这是有损于科学的心理学的发展的。人的意识是心理学的对象，但是研究社会意识却是属于历史唯物主义和其它社会科学的领域之内的。研究社会意识及其形成与发展规律不是由心理学来进行，而是由历史唯物主义来实现的。
    这样看来，心理学的客体是作为社会生物存在物的人（人们）的意识，首先是心理活动。
    意识不仅是思维。人的活动的精神领域——心理活动——还包括意志过程，情绪、感觉、表象以及其它认识过程。
    意识是人与人之间，人与周围的现实发生联系的工具，是人在世界当中的定向工具，是反映世界、认识世界的结果。
    可是人不只在心理活动中反映着世界。他也作用于世界。人底能动性、积极性，是他的意识的创造性的表现。因此研究人的积极性（在实现这种积极性时，意识是起着指导作用的）成了心理学的重要任务之一。同时应当记得人的活动及其意识的一般基础。人的活动及其意识二者都是由生产方式底历史特点所决定的。
    归根到底，生产方式（人们对自然力的关系以及人们彼此的关系）决定着人们的心理生活的特点，人的意识适应着这种生产方式的性质，执行着双重的作用——双重的、相互联系着的机能：意识是人们借以交际，并确定其对于自然的理论的与实践的关系的一种工具。同时人作用于自然——人与自然力的斗争，又帮助了人从动物界中划分出来。
    为了确定心理学对象的特性，还必须特别注意下述这个问题：从意识内容的观点来看，研究人的内在世界，是否是心理学的对象？当然，这是心理学上的一个问题，然而每个人都很清楚，研究这个问题必须应用历史唯物主义，必须转而研究社会历史性质的问题。在心理学的范围内，是能够而且应当根据历史唯物主义去研讨许多有关人的精神世界的问题的，而且这是具有巨大现实意义的特别的部分。这一部分可以叫作个性心理学。但个性心理学问题是与社会科学紧密地联系着的，是不能组成心理学的全部内容的，就我们的观点看来，心理学主要应属于自然科学的领域。
    有时心理学者使心理学问题的整个内容都服从于人底个性的研究。这样一来就会取消现在提出的按照谢琴诺夫、巴甫洛夫学说的方向来改造心理学的任务，同时也会使列宁关于科学的心理学应当力求解释心理现象，应当从分析神经过程出发的纲领性指示成为例外的仿佛无关重要的东西了。这是会给改造心理学的事业带来巨大的损失的。心理活动的研究好像是被否定了，而只从历史唯物主义上来解释个性。
    此外，问题的解决不应当是抽象理论的；必须考虑到对人的个性进行科学研究的实践。在这一实践中大半是对事物外部进程的单纯的描述和说明，一般地说来，所得到的结果是既非心理学，也不是历史唯物主义的发展，这还不很明显么。
    由于对个人意识内容的研究，就产生了心理学中的阶级性问题。
    承认心理活动有阶级性，这在逻辑上就会恢复已被斯大林的“马克思主义与语言学问题”著作所彻底揭露并粉碎了的马尔关于语言和思考有阶级性的概念。
    那些从多方面决定着意识内容的阶级基础，并不决定心理过程本身的性质。心理过程，大脑的活动是没有阶级性的。它们具有全人类的性质，不同阶级、不同民族和不同种族的人们都是一样的。自然，它们也具有一些个别的特点，但这些特点在同一阶级，同一民族，同一种族的范围内并不比在不同阶级、不同民族、不同种族的人们身上表现得少，或表现得较单调。这些个别特点并不取决于阶级性、民族性或种族性，而是取决于人们生活活动与生活条件的某些个别的特点，同时也是取决于他们的年龄特点，以及在心理活动性质上反映出来的健康状况等等〔注〕。关于心理的全人类性的原理是非常重要的。必须把这个原理具体地应用到如感觉、知觉、思维这些心理过程上，应用到情绪过程以及意志过程上。但同时也决不能把对心理过程的研究与人的个性，人的兴趣以及活动动机等（在这里会碰到那种可能有阶级基础的东西）完全割裂开来。除了应注意人们心理素质的民族共同性以外，还应该强调指出，必须在心理学中注意有关各不同民族人们精神生活中的共同的东西。由此可见，心理学的问题是多种多样的，决不只限于高级神经活动的问题。同样人类心理学的许多问题也牵涉到历史唯物主义的领域；其次应该注意个人意识内容问题和个人意识形成所经过的具体的自然的科学的途径问题间的相互联系。因此心理学的对象问题是一个很复杂的问题。但心理学的对象毕竟是可以确定的。
    那么心理学这一科学的对象究竟是什么呢？
    心理学是研究表现在人的活动与行为当中的意识，而意识是存在于人脑中的反映。心理学是面对着人的主观世界，确定心理现象的规律性的。心理学认为这些现象是以物质形式与意识形式表现出来的人的高级神经活动的过程。
    心理学是关于人的心理活动的科学，而心理活动是大脑的机能，是表现在人的行为当中的现实的反映。
    心理学研究那些由反映过程、认识过程（这种过程是由高级神经活动，人的整个有机体的工作来实现的）所引起的，而同时又表示着人对其所反映的现实的态度（情绪的与意志的态度）的心理现象的规律性。
    由此可以得出结论：心理学研究智慧的、情绪的与意志的种种过程的内容方面。心理学这一关于人类意识客观规律的科学，也应当研究意识各个方面（认识、情绪与意志等方面）间的相互联系的规律。
    人由于客观现实的影响与大脑的工作，才能在行动过程中反映世界，并且由于对世界的反映（认识）才能有意识地行动起来，因此心理学是研究那些作为密切联系着的过程（人的认识过程——人的行动过程）的心理活动。
    必须补充指出，从这些过程的生理发生过程中所抽象出来的思维的规律性及其种种形式就形成了一种独立科学——逻辑学——的对象，而根据认识论的一般基础来说，心理学又接近于哲学。
    在研究人，特别是研究人的意识时，必须考虑到人类发展的那些社会历史规律性，但这决不是说，研究必须超越于自然科学范围之外。为了说明这一点，可以谈一谈机械学。众所周知，机器是生产工具，是社会生产力的要素，因而，它是属于社会现象之列的。可是在研究机器的工作，研究机器这种机械的效能时，则必然转向技术科学与自然科学，例如机械学、物理学方面，而并不转向政治经济学或其它社会学科。
    其次，应当谈一谈对待心理学术语的态度问题。
    巴甫洛夫并不认为必须否认对智慧、感情和意志这些心理现象的传统评价。巴甫洛夫把联想、感觉、印象、记忆、表象、注意等概念都当做心理学内的合法的概念而加以应用。巴甫洛夫反对应用心理学的术语去从生理上来解释大脑的工作，但他却应用这些心理学术语去标明心理现象。这种见解在根据巴甫洛夫生理学来从事所谓重新估价与重新审查心理学术语与概念的事业上，却被我们导至某些虚无主义的倾向上去。
    同样的一些高级神经活动过程（反射联系、兴奋过程与抑制过程、扩散与集中、正负诱导等）都可以在这些过程与大脑结构的不同的相互关系中，在不同的系统中以及在不同的联系中，引起或将引起各种不同的结果，即引起各种不同的心理现象，反之，各种不同的生理过程又可以引起一些相同的心理现象（例如，注意就是一方面由兴奋的泛化另一方面由抑制过程制约着的），这些都证明心理学是具有特殊性的。
    同样必须说明，相同的一些心理现象，由于同一的神经生理动力与不同的脑的结构区域相联系
  （例如记忆分为听觉记忆与视觉记忆等）也是各有其特殊性的。由此可见巴甫洛夫所确立的关于“力量的作用在空间的分布，动力之适应于结构”的规律性的论断，对于研究心理学问题是有巨大的意义的。
    研究与第一信号系统相互联系的第二信号系统在意识形成上的影响作用问题，研究动力定型的意义及其在人的心理上的变化问题，研究人的性格在生活条件和他们气质等影响而发生的变化之下的形成与培养等问题，也同样不仅证明心理学是与生理学密切联系着的，而且也证明在心理学者面前是有着特殊的科学任务的。
    同时必须指出，心理学如果完全离开社会科学，也是不能正确发展的。假如心理学脱离生活，心理学者不以社会发展的法则，不以建设社会主义与共产主义的法则为基本指针，那么就不可能正确地评价心理现象，正确地确定影响意识的方法，而且也不可能正确地培养与教育，并实现关于心理卫生措施的科学计划等等了。
    可见，如果没有关于社会关系，劳动条件与人们生活的性质的知识，如果没有关于学校工作，学校教学计划，学生生活制度和工作量以及课内工作和课外工作相结合的特点的知识，如果不深入研究像组织和教育过程特点等等的问题，那么想解决儿童心理学问题是毫无根据的。
    为了科学地研究这些心理学问题，必须理解那种作为人脑的反映客体的社会影响的范围。也必须理解在人所实现的多种多样的活动中定向的作用。
    心理学者应当研究社会科学并吸取生活实践的知识来解决自己的问题，但是他们在基本上是限于在自然科学思想范围之内的。可是如果心理学对于社会基础以及基础对人的心理的影响性质没有应有的研究，那它就不能满足现代的要求。
    另外，当研究个性心理学时，为了确定有关人的个性的形成、发展与改变问题上的方向，心理过程的知识又是必要的。
    心理学是研究人的主观世界的。但是它利用着在科学发展实践中经过考验的客观的研究方法。巴甫洛夫在研究高级神经活动上所获得的成就便证明了这一点。但是在心理学者中间有一种想法，认为客观的方法一般地是否认自我意识，自我观察等材料的。这显然是错误的。这首先是因为他们不善于或不愿区别对主观东西的唯物主义的理解与唯心主义的解释之不同。他们把主观的东西轻视为只能歪曲现实而不能获得客观真理的某种东西。然而列宁却教导我们要记住把心理现象的主观性看作是具有客观意义的，就是说，是反映着客观现实的。列宁在给感觉下定义时，把感觉称之为客观世界的主观映象。认识主体，这绝不一定得出关于人的主观世界本身的虚伪的结论。如果对主观状态的估计经过实践的检验，如果得到的结论作为科学资料来看是有实际意义的，那么自我观察的结果就不能不具有客观真理的性质。因此，决不能同意心理学会议所作出的那种无条件的决议，即“自我观察既不能认为是主要的心理学方法，也不能认为是补助的心理学方法”。自我观察可能是科学的，也可能是不科学的。如果自我观察是科学地进行的，那么自我观察就不应被排除在科学方法的武库之外；如果自我观察具有主观主义的性质，那么就必须把它从科学领域内清除出去。因此，问题是在于如何具体地实现自我观察。“一般地”提出问题——即不管自我观察的性质而提出肯定或否认自我观察的问题——这只会引起繁琐的和肤浅的争论。
    其次，低估主观的东西就是歪曲马克思主义对抽象过程的理解，马克思主义永远是从现实的对象与现象出发的，而且据此从个别的东西与具体的东西中进行抽象。因此不能忘记，为了概括心理现象，也必须重视个体的意识。不属于具体的主体的心理是没有的。
    主观的东西——人的心理——是实际存在着的。应当用客观方法研究主观的东西。可是自我观察也可能具有客观的性质，从科学认识论的观点来看，给认识划定范围，宣称人的世界即使对认识主体本身来说也是不可了解的，这都是没有任何根据的。显然，关于这个问题的一切其它议论都是不可知论的表现。排除主观的东西是会碰到合理的反对的，而且是会离开对主观方法的斗争的。因此，这决不会促进，反而会阻碍反对主观主义和精灵论的斗争。依据巴甫洛夫及其关于必须分析心理的东西的指示，不要从主观出发，而要只用客观方法来研究高级神经活动。但不是别人，正是巴甫洛夫说，这种自我观察的材料是巩固了科学的。
    从哲学观点上看，忽视主观的东西，只能使心理学离开辩证唯物主义而走上庸俗的唯物主义的立场。这不仅不能帮助，反而会阻碍揭露内省方法，阻碍粉碎心理学上的主观主义与唯心主义。
    苏联学者正在提高科学思想的理论水平，肃清心理学落后于苏联共产主义建设要求的情况。这乃是一项光荣的任务。加强反对资产阶级概念的斗争，加强肃清这些概念的余毒的影响，是与这一任务的完成密切联系着的。〔注〕顺便谈谈，由此可以得出结论：心理学者在清
    除伪科学——儿童学——之后，竟毫无根据地
    放松了对心理的年龄特点的研究；同时必须承
    认，把心理学者和精神病学者分隔开，是不正
    确的，这阻碍了利用心理学上最重要的临床资
      料。
