    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 27th: The Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a meeting last week, presided over by President Ho Chi Minh, and issued the following communiqué afterwards:
    I. The Council of Ministers heard a report from Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong on the domestic and international situation, and a report from General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, on the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. The meeting believes that:
    The camp of imperialists and warmongers has recently intensified its destructive activities, but the forces of world peace have been opposing and defeating its vicious conspiracies in various parts of Asia and Europe.
    The visits of Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu to the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are of important significance for the consolidation of peace in Asia and contribute to the easing of international tension.
    In Vietnam, the American imperialists, the French colonialists who are sabotaging the ceasefire agreement, and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are seriously violating the Geneva Accords. They are trying every possible means to undermine peace in Indochina, plotting to drag South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, and to divide North and South Vietnam. Their actions are in complete violation of the Geneva Accords and have been resolutely opposed by the Vietnamese people, as well as the people of Indochina, Southeast Asia, and the world. In the face of the resolute and unremitting struggle of the people of all strata in Vietnam to consolidate peace and realize national reunification, and with the support of all the forces of peace in the world for this struggle, the warmongers' conspiracy is bound to fail.
    II. The Standing Committee of the Central Land Reform Committee reported on the sixth phase of mobilizing the peasant masses to implement rent reduction and interest reduction, and the second phase of land reform. The Council of Ministers decided to take some measures to resolve certain land issues in the newly liberated areas, in order to consolidate the countryside and restore production.
    The Council of Ministers also approved: taking measures to take care of the land and property of those who have been lured or forced to go to South Vietnam by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique.
    The Chairman of the Central Social Relief Committee reported on the plan for social relief in areas severely damaged by the war or recently hit by natural disasters.
    The Minister of Labor reported on the work of receiving troops, cadres, and civilians who are regrouping from South Vietnam to the North.
    III. The Deputy Prime Minister reported on the policies, guidelines, and plans for the post-war economic recovery of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    The main tasks in current economic work are to heal the wounds of war, restore the national economy, and gradually improve the material and spiritual life of the people of all strata, in order to consolidate North Vietnam while taking care of South Vietnam.
    The Council of Ministers decided to request the Government of the People's Republic of China to send some Chinese experts and technicians to work in some economic, financial, cultural, and social departments in Vietnam, especially in the transportation sector.
    IV. After hearing the report of the Ministry of Finance, the Council of Ministers decided to abolish the forty heavy taxes previously levied on residents by the French and Bao Dai governments, and replace them with twelve fair and reasonable taxes. The following four taxes will soon be levied: slaughter tax, temporary business tax, enterprise tax, and commodity tax.
    The Council of Ministers called on all departments of the government, the army, cadres, and the entire people to guard against any extravagant, luxurious, or wasteful expenditures.
    V. The Council of Ministers approved a plan to establish a national autonomous region in Northwest Vietnam, in order to bring into play the strength of all nationalities, enable them to develop in all aspects, and further consolidate the unity of all the people in the country.
    VI. The Council of Ministers agreed to establish a museum and named it the "Revolution Museum."
    The Council of Ministers stipulated the festivals and holidays in the year, as well as the weekly working hours.
    VII. The Council of Ministers also discussed the issue of strengthening and expanding the central government. The Council of Ministers decided to appoint: Pham Van Bach, former Chairman of the Anti-Resistance Administrative Committee of Southern Vietnam, as Deputy Minister of the Interior; Ung Van Khiem, former member of the Anti-Resistance Administrative Committee of Southern Vietnam, as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs; and Pham Ngoc Thach, former Chairman of the Anti-Resistance Administrative Committee of Saigon-Cholon, as Deputy Minister of Health.
