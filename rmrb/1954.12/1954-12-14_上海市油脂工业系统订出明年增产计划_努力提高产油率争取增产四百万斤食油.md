    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Shanghai municipal state-owned, joint state-private, and private oil industry has formulated a production increase plan for edible oil for 1955. They plan to increase oil yield within the fixed amount of oilseeds and increase edible oil production by four million jin. Each factory has formulated specific production increase figures and methods based on this overall goal.
    Since the second quarter of this year, some state-owned, joint state-private, and private oil pressing factories in Shanghai have begun to learn and promote Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil pressing method and other advanced experiences. After the National Oil Conference, the enthusiasm of factory workers to learn advanced experiences, improve operating methods, and increase oil yield has become even higher. Preliminary results have already been achieved. The state-owned Shanghai Oil and Fat Factory No. 1 had an average residual oil rate of 5.14 in peanut dry cake in the first half of this year. After learning the embryo rolling and steaming principles of Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method in November, it has been reduced to 4.91. On December 8, individual shifts have been reduced to 4.14, creating a new record for Shanghai in reducing the residual oil rate of dry cake. The private Dayouyu Oil Pressing Factory has improved its cold-pressing soybean technology operation, and the oil yield has also increased from 9 jin to more than 10 jin. At the Shanghai Oil Industry Conference held from December 7th to 9th, various factories exchanged the above-mentioned advanced experiences and criticized the conservative thinking and complacency in promoting advanced experiences, laying an ideological foundation for increasing oil production and saving resources next year.

    上海市油脂工业系统订出明年增产计划
    努力提高产油率争取增产四百万斤食油
    【本报讯】上海市国营、公私合营和私营油脂工业订出一九五五年食油增产计划，准备在固定油料内提高产油率、增产四百万斤食油。各厂根据这个总目标，订出了具体的增产数字和办法。
    今年第二季度以来，上海部分国营、公私合营、私营榨油厂已开始学习和推广李川江先进榨油法及其他先进经验。全国油脂会议后，各厂职工学习先进经验，改进操作法，提高产油率的热情更加高涨。现已获得初步成绩。国营上海油脂一厂，今年上半年花生干饼平均残油率为五点一四，十一月份学习了李川江榨油法的轧胚和蒸胚原理以后，已降低到四点九一，十二月八日个别班次已降低到四点一四，创造了上海降低干饼残油率的新纪录。私营大有余榨油厂，改进了冷榨大豆技术操作，产油率也从九斤提高到十斤以上。在十二月七日到九日召开的上海油脂工业会议上，各厂交流了上述先进经验，并批判了在推广先进经验中的保守思想和自满情绪，为明年油脂增产节约打下了思想基础。
