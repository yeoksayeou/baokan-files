    Liannan Yao Autonomous Region Repairs River Channels
    The Liannan Yao Autonomous Region in Guangdong Province is repairing river channels to facilitate timber transportation. The first phase of the Lian Shan River improvement project was completed on November 20th.
    The Liannan Yao Autonomous Region is one of the main forestry areas in Guangdong Province, rich in construction timber such as pine and fir. However, the rivers within the region are turbulent and full of dangerous shoals, making it impossible to raft and transport timber, resulting in very low transportation efficiency. In the past, it took twenty-five days to transport timber from the mountains to the purchasing station. Now, after the completion of the first phase of the Lian Shan River project, it only takes two days to transport it.

    连南瑶族自治区整修河道
    广东省连南瑶族自治区整修河道，便利木材运输。第一期整修连山河的工程已在十一月二十日完成。
    连南瑶族自治区是广东省主要林区之一，盛产松、杉等建筑木材。但境内河流湍急，险滩又多，不能把木材扎排放运，运输效率很低。过去，要二十五天才能从山上把木材运到收购站，现在，连山河第一期工程整修完工后，两天便可运到。
