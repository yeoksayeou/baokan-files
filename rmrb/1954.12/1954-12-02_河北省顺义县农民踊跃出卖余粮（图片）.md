Farmers in Shunyi County, Hebei Province, enthusiastically support the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain. After the autumn harvest, members of agricultural producers' cooperatives immediately dried and winnowed their surplus grain, waiting for the state to purchase it, and proposed to sell good grain to the state. Some farmers also made grain consumption plans, saving more grain to sell to the state. They believe that selling surplus grain to the state is a concrete patriotic action for farmers to participate in socialist construction and support the liberation of Taiwan.

Currently, the grain purchasing work in Shunyi County is in full swing. After selling surplus grain, farmers not only buy back production tools and daily necessities, but also deposit the remaining money in credit cooperatives.

    河北省顺义县农民踊跃出卖余粮
    河北省顺义县的农民热烈拥护国家的粮食统购统销政策。在秋收以后，农业生产合作社的社员们立刻把余粮晒干扬净，等待国家收购，并且提出要把好粮卖给国家。有些农民还做出用粮计划，节约出更多的粮食卖给国家。他们认为向国家出售余粮，是农民参加社会主义建设，支援解放台湾的一种具体的爱国主义行动。
    目前顺义县的购粮工作正在热烈展开，农民们在卖余粮后，除买回生产工具和日用品外，还把余款存入信用合作社。

    顺义县农民卖粮热情十分高涨。在通往国家粮库的公路上，卖粮的大车川流不息。
    顺义县的农民向国家出卖大批余粮，并把卖粮的钱存入信用合作社，以便进一步发展农业生产。农民张广德正把卖粮所得的五十万元存入信用合作社。
    顺义县张喜庄村“五四”农业生产合作社今年卖给国家二万五千斤余粮。这是社员们正在认真地把卖给国家的粮食扬净。
