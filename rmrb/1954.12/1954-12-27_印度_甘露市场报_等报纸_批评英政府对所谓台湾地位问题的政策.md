Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 26th: The Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on the 23rd criticizing the British government's policy on the so-called Taiwan status issue.

The editorial, in discussing the statement made by British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Reading that "the status of Taiwan is a somewhat difficult one in international law," pointed out that according to the 1943 Cairo Declaration, Taiwan, formerly ruled by Japan, should be returned to China after the war.

The editorial then questioned Reading's statement that "we do not consider it [referring to Taiwan] to be part of the People's Republic of China," saying, "Why not? Isn't this a serious violation of the solemn declaration personally signed by Prime Minister Churchill?"

The editorial also condemned the attitude of the British representative to the United Nations, Nutting, in interfering with China's liberation of Taiwan. The editorial said, "In any case, the Nutting incident has made one thing clear: that Britain's policy towards Taiwan, which was previously cleverly made ambiguous, is now openly stated to be consistent with that of the United States."

The Bengali daily "Ananda Bazar Patrika" wrote on the 21st that the Prime Ministers of India and Burma have always believed that Taiwan belongs to China and should therefore be returned to China. The newspaper said that not only these two Prime Ministers, but also many politicians around the world, have repeatedly stated and affirmed this view.

    印度“甘露市场报”等报纸
    批评英政府对所谓台湾地位问题的政策
    【新华社新德里二十六日电】印度“甘露市场报”二十三日发表社论，批评英国政府对所谓台湾地位问题的政策。
    社论在谈到英国外交副大臣里丁所说的“台湾的地位是一个在国际法上有些困难的地位”的说法时指出：根据一九四三年的开罗宣言，以前由日本统治的台湾在战后应该归还中国。
    社论接着对里丁所说的“我们并不认为它（按指台湾）构成中华人民共和国的一部分”的说法提出责问说：“为什么不呢？难道这不是严重地违反了邱吉尔首相亲自签字的庄严宣言吗？”
    社论也谴责了英国驻联合国代表纳丁干涉中国解放台湾的态度。社论说：“不管怎样，纳丁事件已经使一件事情弄清楚了，这就是：英国对台湾的政策以前曾经被巧妙地弄得模棱两可，而现在已经公然说明它是和美国一致的。”
    二十一日的孟加拉文日报“欢喜市场报”写道：印度和缅甸的总理一直认为台湾属于中国，因而应该归还给中国。报纸说，不仅这两位总理、而且全世界许多政治家都一再表明并且肯定了这种意见。
