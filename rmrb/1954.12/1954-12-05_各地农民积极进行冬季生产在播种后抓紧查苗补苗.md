In Hubei Province, as of the end of November, the province had completed a winter sowing area of more than 30.06 million mu, accounting for 85.9 percent of the planned area, of which rapeseed has exceeded the planned area by 9.3 percent.

Currently, the phenomenon of missing seedlings in winter-sown crops is relatively serious. According to inspections in Guanghua, Gucheng, Baokang, Huangpi, Yingshan, Yunmeng, Xishui and other counties, the general lack of seedlings in wheat and rapeseed is 20 to 30 percent, and in some severe cases it reaches 70 to 80 percent. These areas have launched a campaign to check and replenish seedlings. Guanghua, Baokang, Gucheng and other counties have organized forces at the county and district levels to conduct in-depth inspections and hold on-the-spot meetings to reverse the paralyzing thought among some cadres that winter sowing is over and everything is fine. Then, by calculating the accounts of yield reduction due to missing seedlings and yield increase due to replenishing seedlings, and relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, a campaign to check and replenish seedlings was launched. For example, Wangzhuang Village, Hongchunshu Township, Seventh District of Guanghua County, adopted the above methods. Under the leadership of the Du Xueding mutual aid group, all eight mutual aid groups in the village irrigated and transplanted 86 mu, replanted 130 mu, and changed planting on 4 mu. In individual areas with more severe drought, small-scale symposiums were generally held to summarize the drought resistance experience of the masses and launch a drought resistance campaign.

Winter Idle Season for Manure Accumulation and Basic Farmland Construction

In order to prepare for next year's production, the requirements of the leading organs of Rehe Province for this winter's rural production are: based on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, vigorously mobilize farmers to accumulate fertilizer and carry out basic farmland construction; and, under the principle of production based on sales orders, organize farmers to engage in sideline production combined with national plans and agricultural production needs. All counties and banners have discussed and formulated winter production plans suitable for local conditions based on the above spirit. Various production activities have now been initially launched. Farmers in Chifeng County have recently repaired more than 70 channels and have begun irrigating winter water to prevent spring drought.

Accumulate More Fertilizer This Winter for More Production Next Year

The Zhimagou Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, has consistently attached importance to accumulating fertilizer for the past three years, and its harvests have been higher year after year. The year before last, the cooperative applied 58 dan of fertilizer per mu of land and harvested 1.4 shi of grain; last year, it applied 63 dan of fertilizer per mu and harvested 1.63 shi of grain; this year, it applied 67 dan of fertilizer per mu and harvested 1.75 shi of grain. This year, after the publicity of the policy of unified purchase and sale, the consciousness of the members has been further improved. The whole cooperative enthusiastically sold more than 33,000 jin of surplus grain and proposed the goal of striving to sell 8,600 jin more grain than this year next year. In order to ensure more production and more grain sales next year, everyone discussed and decided to accumulate more fertilizer, and next year to apply 75 dan of fertilizer per mu of land (8 dan more than this year), and strive to increase production by 20 jin of grain compared to this year. All members of the cooperative have a high degree of confidence in completing the fertilizer accumulation plan. Huo Dengyuan said: "Dig pits to ferment, cut firewood to smoke, and then go to the East Mountain to sweep up sheep manure. As long as everyone works together, the plan can be completed." At present, all 40 toilets in the cooperative have accumulated 1,470 dan of fertilizer, 49 small manure pools have produced 4,900 dan of fertilizer, 7 cattle pens have produced 700 dan of fertilizer, 500 dan of fertilizer have been produced using the high-temperature rapid fermentation method, 1,500 dan of fertilizer have been produced by plowing and smoking stubble, and 500 dan of fertilizer have been produced by chopping up corn stalks and fermenting them in the wild, for a total of more than 9,570 dan of fertilizer.

Strive to Increase Production by 100,000 Jin of Grain

The Song Zongguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Third District of Kunyu County, Shandong Province, expanded from 91 households to 305 households before this autumn, increasing a large number of laborers. When formulating the winter production plan, the cooperative decided to make full use of these laborers to carry out winter agricultural and sideline production. In addition to stipulating projects such as winter plowing, deep plowing, topdressing of wheat, and pushing soil to accumulate manure, the plan decided to carry out large-scale basic farmland construction work, requiring 30 mu of sand nest land to be turned over, 80 mu of sand to be covered, 60 mu of wasteland and saline-alkali land to be transformed into paddy fields (striving for 100 mu), 10 mu of terrace land to be repaired, and 700,000 jin of stones to be moved. In order to develop fruit forestry and animal husbandry next year, it was also decided to reclaim 100 mu of wasteland, dig 2,500 fruit tree pits, and build 10 pigsties. In terms of sideline production, it was decided to continue oil pressing, strip weaving, mat weaving, carpentry, and pig raising. The number of collectively owned pigs will be increased by 30.

If the above plan can be fully completed, it is estimated that sideline production can generate a net profit of 23,000 jin of grain, 60 mu of paddy fields can generate at least 30,000 jin of rice, sand pressing, land turning, and terrace land repair can increase production by 10,000 jin, and manure accumulation can generate 40,000 jin. These items alone will create a value of more than 100,000 jin of grain.

Tea Gardens Must Implement Winter Plowing and Winter Planting

Tea is a very important sideline production for farmers in Hunan Province. This year, the province produced more than 340,000 dan of tea, an increase of 6 percent over last year, and the quality also met the standards. In order to produce more tea next year and support national construction, 16 key tea-producing counties held a tea farmer representative meeting in October to implement the guiding principles and policies for tea production and impart tea garden cultivation and management techniques. At the same time, various localities also purchased more than 700 dan of high-quality tea seeds in Anhua and other places to supply seed-deficient areas. Farmers in various localities are also actively preparing for winter plowing and winter planting in tea gardens. According to statistics from eight major tea-producing counties in Xiangtan Prefecture, the area of winter planting in tea gardens this year reached more than 95 percent, including more than 2,000 mu of newly built and renovated tea gardens and more than 15,000 mu of reclaimed barren tea gardens. At present, farmers are actively making preparations and will start sowing as soon as the tea seeds arrive. Technical cadres are also conducting technical demonstration work in a focused manner in order to gain experience and promote it comprehensively.

Launch a Movement to Dig Up Rice Roots and Eliminate Pests

Farmers in Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, have launched a mass winter pest control movement in order to lay the foundation for increased production next year. Farmers in Sgang Township in the suburban area proposed to thoroughly control pests. More than 570 mu of the township's 635 mu of early and late rice fields have been hoeed, split, or had their rice roots dug up and destroyed, and then ponds have been opened in the fields to ferment the dug-up rice roots into fertilizer. In the process of promoting the hoeing and splitting method, the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Caogang Township organized the surrounding masses to conduct on-site experiments. The masses who visited saw the pests that had been split and killed on the spot, and the efficiency was more than doubled compared to the three-sided quick shovel. They believed that this method was good and automatically promoted the hoeing and splitting tool. According to statistics from Caogang Township alone, 989 of the three-sided quick shovels were converted into hoeing and splitting knives. At present, more than 90 percent of the county's 28,900 mu of rice fields have been hoeed, split, and had their rice roots dug up and destroyed. Pest control work in late rice fields is still continuing.

Winter Leisure Turns into Winter Busyness

Seventeen agricultural production cooperatives in Kele Township, Chenggong County, Yunnan Province, actively carry out winter production activities, leading farmers throughout the township to turn "winter leisure into winter busyness." The 10th and 11th agricultural production cooperatives in the township plan to weed all the wheat in the cooperative in four days, ensuring that it is pressed and weeded, and applying 8 to 9 loads of topdressing fertilizer per labor unit. They also plan to accumulate 60 loads of horse manure and cow manure and sweep 140 loads of street ash. The Second Agricultural Production Cooperative reorganized its labor force based on four production teams and decided that male members would plant Haigeng land and plant vegetables, and female members would press the first round of rapeseed and wheat, and organize sideline production in a planned manner. In addition to doing a good job in sideline production such as milling flour and raising pigs, the whole cooperative also plans to raise 300 chickens.

    各地农民积极进行冬季生产在播种后抓紧查苗补苗
    湖北省截至十一月下旬止，全省的冬播面积共计完成三千零六百多万亩，占计划面积百分之八十五点九，其中油菜已超过计划面积百分之九点三。
    目前冬播作物的缺苗现象比较严重。据光化、谷城、保康、黄陂、应山、云梦、浠水等县检查，小麦、油菜一般缺苗百分之二十到三十，个别严重的达百分之七十至八十。这些地区已开展查苗补苗运动。光化、保康、谷城等县，已由县、区组织力量，深入重点检查，就地召开会议，扭转有些干部以为冬播已毕，万事大吉的麻痹思想，然后通过算缺苗减产与补苗增产账，并依靠互助合作组织，开展了查苗补苗运动。如光化县七区红椿树乡王庄村采取以上办法，在杜学定互助组的带动下，全村八个互助组即浇水移栽八十六亩，补种一百三十亩，改种四亩。在个别干旱较重地区，一般都召开了小型的座谈会，总结群众的抗旱经验，开展抗旱运动。　（本报湖北记者站）
    冬闲积肥和农田基本建设
    为给明年生产作好准备，热河省领导机关对今冬农村生产的要求是：以互助合作组织为基础，大力发动农民积肥和进行农田基本建设；在以销订产的原则下，组织农民进行与国家计划和农业生产需要相结合的副业生产。各县、旗都根据上述精神，讨论和制订了适合当地情况的冬季生产计划。现在各种生产活动已初步展开。赤峰县农民最近已经修好了渠道七十多条，并已开始浇灌冬水，预防春旱。
    今冬多积肥，明年多增产
    山西省武乡县芝麻?村农业生产合作社，三年来一贯重视积肥，收成一年比一年高。前年社里每亩地施肥五十八担，收粮一石四斗；去年每亩施肥六十三担，收粮一石六斗三升；今年每亩施肥六十七担，收粮一石七斗五升。今年经过统购统销政策的宣传，社员觉悟又得到提高，全社踊跃地出卖余粮三万三千余斤，并提出明年要比今年多卖八千六百斤粮食的奋斗目标。为了保证明年多增产多卖粮，大家讨论决定多积肥，明年每亩地施肥七十五担（比今年增加八担），争取比今年增产二十斤粮。全体社员对完成积肥计划的信心很高，霍灯元说：“打坑沤，割柴熏，再到东山扫羊粪，只要齐动手，计划就能完成。”现在全社四十个厕所积肥一千四百七十担，四十九个小粪池造肥四千九百担，七个牛圈造肥七百担，采用高温速成沤肥法造肥五百担，刨茬熏肥一千五百担，把玉茭秆在野外铡碎沤肥五百担，共已积肥九千五百七十余担。
    为增产十万斤粮食而努力
    山东省崑嵛县三区宋宗国农业生产合作社，今年秋前由九十一户扩大到了三百零五户，增加了大批劳动力。在制订冬季生产计划时，该社决定充分利用这些劳动力，开展冬季农副业生产。计划中除规定了冬耕、深刨、小麦追肥、推土积粪等项目外，决定大规模开展农田基本建设工作，要求翻沙窝地三十亩，压沙八十亩，利用荒地碱地改造水田六十亩（争取一百亩），修台子地十亩，搬石头七十万斤。为了明年发展果林业和养畜业，还决定开荒一百亩，挖果树坑二千五百个，修猪圈十个。副业方面，决定继续进行榨油、编条、编席、木工、养猪等生产。公有猪再增加三十口。
    上述计划如能全盘完成，预计副业能收入纯利二万三千斤粮，六十亩水田最少能收入水稻三万斤，压沙、翻地、修台子地能增产一万斤，积粪能收入四万斤。仅这几项，将能创造十万多斤粮的价值。
    茶园要实行冬耕冬种
    茶叶是湖南省农民一项很重要的副业生产，今年全省产茶叶三十四万多担，比去年增产百分之六而且品质也符合标准。为了明年生产更多的茶叶，支援国家建设，十六个重点产茶县十月间召开了茶农代表会议，贯彻了茶叶生产的方针政策，传授了茶园栽培管理技术。同时，各地还在安化等地收购了七百多担优良茶籽供应缺种地区。各地农民也积极准备茶园冬耕冬种工作。据湘潭专区八个主要产茶县的统计，今年茶园冬种面积达百分之九十五以上，其中扩建和改建新式茶园二千多亩，垦植荒芜茶园一万五千多亩。目前，农民正在积极进行准备工作，等茶籽运到即开始播种。技术干部也正在有重点地进行技术示范工作，以便取得经验全面推广。

    开展掘稻根除虫运动
    浙江省平湖县农民为了打下明年增产基础，开展了群众性的冬季治虫运动。城郊区三港乡农民提出彻底治虫，全乡六百三十五亩早晚稻田，已经锄劈或掘毁稻根五百七十多亩，并随即在田头开潭，把掘出的稻根沤肥。曹港乡第一农业生产合作社在推广锄劈方法中，组织周围群众实地试验，参观的群众当场看到了劈死的虫子，效率又比三面快铲提高了一倍多，相信了这个办法好，自动推广了锄劈工具，仅曹港一个乡的统计，把三面快铲改装为锄劈刀的就有九百八十九把。目前全县二万八千九百亩稻田，已锄劈和掘毁稻根百分之九十以上。晚稻田的治虫工作仍在继续进行中。
    冬闲变为冬忙
    云南省呈贡县可乐乡十七个农业生产合作社积极开展冬季生产活动，带动全乡农民把“冬闲变为冬忙”。该乡第十、第十一两个农业生产合作社计划四天薅完全社的麦子，保证做到压一道、薅一道，每工田施追肥八挑到九挑；还准备积马粪、牛粪六十挑，扫街心灰一百四十挑。第二农业生产合作社以四个生产小组为基础，重新组织了劳动力，决定男社员种海埂地、栽菜，女社员压第一道油菜和麦子，并有计划的组织副业生产，全社除做好磨粉、养猪等副业生产外，还准备养鸡三百只。
