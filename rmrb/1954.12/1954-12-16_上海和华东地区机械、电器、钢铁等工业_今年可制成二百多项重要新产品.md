【Dispatch from Shanghai, December 15th】 Shanghai and East China's machinery, electrical appliance, and steel industries have made new achievements in the trial manufacture of new products this year. By the end of December, the factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building in Shanghai and East China will have completed the trial production of 221 major new products, an increase of nearly two times compared with last year (86 items). There are even more scattered new products. Many joint state-private and private factories have also actively participated in the trial manufacture of new products to support the country's socialist construction. The joint state-private Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory alone, with just one trial production workshop, has manufactured more than 500 kinds of complete sets of switchgear and various odd products in the past year.

These new products are mostly to support national capital construction. Among them are various machine tools with precision reaching Soviet standards, automatic control equipment, precision instruments, giant boilers, transformers, electric traveling cranes, high-speed diesel engines, high-voltage power cables, self-made resistance wire, and 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators.

Since last year, a large number of new products have been continuously shipped to Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest China, playing a huge role in the country's socialist construction.

    上海和华东地区机械、电器、钢铁等工业
    今年可制成二百多项重要新产品
    【本报上海十五日电】上海和华东地区机械、电器、钢铁等工业中新产品试制工作，今年又有了新成就。到十二月底为止，第一机械工业部所属上海和华东地区各厂共可完成二百二十一项主要新产品试制任务，比去年（八十六项）增加了近两倍。其他零星的新产品更多。许多公私合营和私营工厂，也积极参加了新产品试制工作，来支援国家社会主义建设。仅公私合营上海华通开关厂一个试制车间，一年多以来所制成的成套开关设备和各种零星产品共达五百多种。
    这些新产品，大都是支援国家基本建设的。其中有精密度达到苏联标准的各种工作母机、自动化控制设备、精密仪表、巨型的锅炉、变压器、电动行车、高速柴油机、高压电力电缆、自制电阻丝和六千瓩汽轮发电机等。
    从去年以来，大批新产品已源源运往东北、西北、西南各地，对国家社会主义建设起着巨大作用。
