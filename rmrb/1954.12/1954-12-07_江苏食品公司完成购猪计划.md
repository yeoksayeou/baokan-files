    Jiangsu Food Company Completes Pig Purchase Plan
    The Jiangsu Provincial Company of the China Food Company completed 101.23% of its annual pig purchase plan in late November. Jiangsu Province is a well-known pig-producing area in the country. The completion of the pig purchase plan not only meets the needs of the people in cities, industrial and mining areas in the province, as well as Beijing, Shanghai, and the Northeast, but also provides the state with frozen pork for export (ten tons of frozen pork can be exchanged for a tractor).
    The company also completed its annual fresh egg purchase plan ahead of schedule. (Ji Anli, Liu Guangzhi)

    江苏食品公司完成购猪计划
    中国食品公司江苏省公司于十一月下旬完成了全年毛猪收购计划的百分之一百零一点二三。江苏省是全国有名产猪区，毛猪收购计划的完成，不仅可以满足本省城市、工矿区及北京、上海、东北等地人民的需要，还可以供给国家加工冻猪肉出口（十吨冻猪肉就能换回一部拖拉机）。
    这个公司并同时提前完成了全年鲜鸡蛋收购计划。　（纪安礼　刘广志）
