On December 7th of this month, the Japanese cabinet headed by Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida of the Liberal Party announced its collective resignation. On the 10th, the new Japanese cabinet headed by Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama of the Democratic Party was officially formed. The following day, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu of the new government issued a statement saying that Japan is willing to restore normal relations with the Soviet Union and China under mutually acceptable conditions. We believe that this statement by the new Japanese government is welcome.

On the issue of restoring normal relations with Japan, the Chinese people fully support and endorse the statement made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the 16th regarding relations with Japan. We believe that normalizing Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union is not only in the vital interests of the Japanese people, but also helps to consolidate peace in the Far East and ease international tensions. People will remember that in the joint declaration on relations with Japan issued by the Chinese and Soviet governments on October 12th of this year, the two countries expressed their common desire to restore normal relations with Japan. The declaration clearly pointed out: "The policies of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Government towards Japan are based on the principle that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, and believe that this is in the vital interests of all countries. They advocate developing extensive trade relations with Japan on mutually beneficial terms and establishing close cultural ties with Japan. At the same time, the two governments express their willingness to take steps to normalize their relations with Japan." In October of this year, Premier Zhou Enlai, in his talks with the Japanese Diet members delegation to China and the Japanese academic and cultural delegation to China, also explained that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, and the Chinese government is willing to work for the early restoration of normal relations between China and Japan.

Facts have proved that the peace-loving people of Japan warmly welcome this friendly attitude of sincerely safeguarding peace, as expressed in the successive statements of China and the Soviet Union. Immediately after the publication of the joint Sino-Soviet declaration on relations with Japan, the movement in Japan to strive for the establishment of normal relations and trade with China and the Soviet Union developed more widely. On October 28th, prominent figures from Japanese political, economic, and cultural circles formed a national organization to promote the movement to restore diplomatic relations between Japan, China, and the Soviet Union and actively launched activities. The "Asahi Shimbun" wrote in its editorial on October 13th: All Japanese people hope for the normalization of relations between Japan, China, and the Soviet Union, and believe that Japan and the Soviet Union can coexist peacefully. According to the latest issue of the Japanese "Sekai" magazine, after reading the records of Premier Zhou Enlai's talks with the above-mentioned two Japanese delegations to China, Jotaro Kawakami, chairman of the right-wing Socialist Party, expressed the opinion that Premier Zhou Enlai's talks showed that China eagerly desires peace. There is no doubt that China advocates peaceful coexistence. Continuing to work towards establishing friendly relations is very necessary for Japan. Tokutaro Kitamura, a former member of the Kaishinto Party, said: We are very pleased with the joint declaration on relations with Japan issued by the governments of China and the Soviet Union on October 12th, which, based on the principle that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, created a beginning for the restoration of Sino-Japanese and Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations.

However, the wishes of the Japanese people have been repeatedly obstructed by the American occupiers and a handful of stubborn elements in Japan headed by Yoshida. The American occupiers, for the benefit of a small number of American financial oligarchs, have been hindering the rapprochement between Japan and its neighbors—China and the Soviet Union. They fully understand that if Japan is allowed to approach its neighbors, it will alleviate its economic difficulties and thereby promote its tendency to demand freedom from dependence on the United States. Therefore, they do not hesitate to resort to various despicable means to sabotage it. After Foreign Minister Molotov issued a statement on relations with Japan, U.S. State Department officials openly stated that if Japan accepts Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal, then "U.S.-Japan relations will deteriorate." This shameless attitude of the American aggression group fully demonstrates that they want to continue to control Japan and not allow Japan to take any independent policies for its own interests, in order to use Japan as a tool to antagonize China and the Soviet Union and aggravate international tensions. The attempt of the American occupiers to keep Japan under their control for a long time cannot but arouse the unanimous indignation of the Japanese people and all people of justice in the world. The downfall of the Japanese Yoshida Cabinet is the inevitable result of its years of pursuing a treasonous policy of following the United States.

For six years, a handful of stubborn elements in Japan headed by Yoshida have consistently followed the United States and antagonized China and the Soviet Union. They have promoted the dependence of Japan's industry and finance on U.S. military orders, imposed the "embargo" shackles of the American occupiers on the Japanese people, in order to hinder the development of trade relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union. At the same time, they suppressed the Japanese people's calls for the restoration of normal relations with China and the Soviet Union, and suppressed the Japanese people's movement for independence, peace, and democracy. This reactionary policy of the Yoshida Cabinet has brought serious difficulties to the Japanese economy and deepened Japan's dependence on the United States. Therefore, it is not only spurned by the Japanese people, but also opposed by enlightened people within the Japanese bourgeoisie and the Liberal Party. Therefore, the downfall of the Yoshida Cabinet shows that succumbing to the war policies of the American occupiers is contrary to the interests of the Japanese nation and is unpopular. The Japanese people firmly demand to get rid of the status of a semi-occupied country, develop their own peaceful economy and national culture, implement an independent foreign policy, restore and develop normal relations with its neighbors and other countries in accordance with the interests of the Japanese nation, and thus devote themselves to the cause of maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. In the future, whoever violates this wish of the Japanese people will repeat Yoshida's mistakes.

Since the downfall of the Yoshida Cabinet, the new Japanese government has shown some new attitudes on the issue of relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union. In addition to the above-mentioned statement by Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, Prime Minister Hatoyama further stated on the 19th, while beginning his campaign tour, that steps should be taken to end the state of war between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, as the first step to restore relations, and relevant countries should exchange commercial envoys. This expression of the new Japanese government is obviously noteworthy. The People's Republic of China has repeatedly stated that it is willing to take steps to restore normal relations with Japan. However, on the 18th, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu said in response to questions from opposition members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Councillors regarding relations with the Soviet Union: Japan cannot immediately start negotiations with the Soviet Union, nor does it intend to inquire about specific conditions from Japan's side. In answering questions about Sino-Japanese relations, he also said: This relationship depends on its relationship with the United Nations, especially with the United States, and depends on the international situation, and indicated that the Japanese government does not intend to consider changing its attitude towards China now. This self-contradictory attitude of the new Japanese government can only have two explanations: either, as reported by the Associated Press Tokyo on the 21st, the statements of Hatoyama and Shigemitsu regarding the restoration of normal relations with the Soviet Union and China are nothing more than "campaign natured"; or they are succumbing to the pressure of the U.S. government. People cannot but be suspicious of the sincerity of the attitude shown by the new Japanese government.

In this regard, we believe that the attitude of the left and right wings of the Socialist Party is welcome. In the joint campaign platform published by the left and right wings of the Japanese Socialist Party on the 27th, it was pointed out that Japan should restore normal relations with China and the Soviet Union. For example, Sata, director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Left Socialist Party, said: "It goes without saying that the restoration of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union should be realized quickly. Seeing the recent international situation, our country should seriously consider the actual measures for the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations and immediately start negotiations with the Soviet Union." However, in Japan today, there are also many other wrong views.

Some people, believing the nonsense of Yoshida, Okazaki and others, mistakenly believe that China and the Soviet Union's proposal on the restoration of normal relations with Japan is a so-called "peace offensive" and has no practical significance. We believe that this statement is not worth refuting. Even during the Yoshida era, although the Yoshida cabinet consistently adopted a hostile attitude towards our country, our Chinese people have repeatedly expressed our sincerity in wishing to be friendly with Japan through actions. In June 1952, our country signed the first Sino-Japanese trade agreement with Japanese Diet members Takara Tomi et al. The following year in October, our country signed another Sino-Japanese trade agreement with the delegation headed by Ikeda Masanosuke of the "Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade". Since this year, the amount of Sino-Japanese trade has greatly increased. In February 1953, at the request of the Japanese Red Cross Society, our country conducted negotiations with the delegation of the Japanese Red Cross Society on the issue of assisting Japanese residents in China who wished to return to Japan, and to date, our country has assisted more than 27,000 Japanese residents in China to return to Japan. When Premier Zhou Enlai received two Japanese delegations to China in October of this year and answered the questions raised by the representatives, he again stated that we are willing to adopt a lenient policy towards Japanese war criminals, and we are also willing to negotiate with Japan on fishery issues. Can people say that this series of concrete measures is meaningless and not a sincere effort to restore normal Sino-Japanese relations? Facts also prove that, thanks to the efforts of the Soviet and Chinese countries and peace-loving people around the world, the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina have eased the then international tensions. Can these actions also be said to be meaningless and a so-called "peace offensive"?

There are also some confused people who say that the "time is not yet ripe" for the restoration of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Japan and between China and Japan. These words clearly show that these people do not have enough courage to establish Japan's independent and autonomous policies, and can only act according to the expressions of the United States, perfunctorily dealing with public opinion and deceiving the people. We believe that the opposite is true, as Kazami Akira, a non-partisan member of the Japanese Diet, said after reading the records of Premier Zhou Enlai's talks with the two Japanese delegations to China: "It can be said that the time for the restoration of diplomatic relations has matured to the point of 'knocking on the door and it will open'." People believe that anyone who sincerely hopes to restore normal relations between the Soviet Union and Japan and between China and Japan should quickly respond to Foreign Minister Molotov's statement.

Some people also say that if Japan wants to restore normal relations with China and the Soviet Union, it must first sever its relationship with the United States. We believe that this is unfounded. Regarding this point, the joint Soviet-Chinese declaration on Japan did not say such a thing at all, not even a word. Because the principle of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and China is: all countries with different social systems can coexist and promote practical affairs with all countries—including Japan. We are willing to take steps to restore normal relations with Japan on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. We adhere to this basic policy, we have seen it that way in the past, and we will see it that way in the future. It is Japan's internal affair to establish or improve diplomatic relations with any country, and we have no intention of interfering. What we oppose is the aggressive policy of the U.S. government, but we have always treated the American people as friends. What we are guarding against is the U.S. using Japan as a military base for aggression against China. We believe that the Japanese people should also be very clear about this. Therefore, the issue is very clear. It is not that the Soviet Union and China are using Japan's severance of relations with the United States as a condition for Japan's restoration of normal relations with China and the Soviet Union, but that the United States is doing its utmost to undermine all efforts by Japan to restore normal relations with China and the Soviet Union. Finally, some people have spread the nonsense that they are preparing to recognize both China and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan as two independent countries. People should remember that Taiwan is a part of China's sacred territory, and the Chinese people will never give up until Taiwan is liberated. From Japan's point of view, what good is it for Japan to maintain contact with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan, who are despised by the Chinese people? The Chiang bandit gang is not only spurned by the Chinese people, but also deeply hated by the people of Southeast Asian countries. The Chiang bandit gang's subversive activities in Southeast Asian countries have long been exposed to the world. Japan, on the one hand, hopes to develop trade with Eastern countries, and on the other hand, is reluctant to part with the Chiang bandit gang. This approach will only bring harm to Japan.

We believe that after clarifying the above-mentioned views, it can be affirmed that the time for the restoration of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Japan and between China and Japan has matured. We welcome all practical and feasible measures related to the restoration of normal relations between Japan and our country. We are willing to take steps to restore normal relations with Japan. At the same time, we hope that the new Japanese government can prove with actions its sincerity in restoring normal relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union. Premier Zhou Enlai has clearly pointed out at the first plenary session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Our country is willing to establish normal relations with Japan. If the Japanese government can also hold the same desire and adopt corresponding measures, the Chinese government will be prepared to take steps to normalize relations between China. China and Japan. The Chinese government advocates the extensive development of trade relations with Japan in accordance with the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and the establishment of close cultural ties with Japan." Japan should have its own independent foreign policy, and people have reason to believe that Japanese political leaders should promptly make decisions that conform to Japan's interests.

### 论日本和中国恢复正常关系

    论日本和中国恢复正常关系
    本月七日，以自由党吉田茂为首相的日本内阁，宣布总辞职。十日，以民主党鸠山一郎为首相的日本新内阁，正式组成。次日，日本新政府外务相重光葵发表声明说，日本愿意在彼此可以接受的条件下，恢复同苏联和中国的正常关系。对于日本新政府的这一声明，我们认为是值得欢迎的。
    在恢复同日本正常关系的问题上，中国人民完全支持和拥护苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在十六日就对日本的关系问题发表的声明。我们认为使日本同中苏两国关系正常化，不仅符合日本人民的切身利益，而且也有助于巩固远东和平与缓和国际紧张局势。人们会记得，在今年十月十二日发表的中苏两国政府关于对日本关系的联合宣言中，中苏两国即已表示了愿与日本恢复正常关系的共同愿望。该宣言明确地指出：“中华人民共和国政府和苏联政府对日关系的政策，是根据不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处的原则。并且相信，这是符合各国人民的切身利益的。它们主张同日本按照互利的条件发展广泛的贸易关系，并同日本建立密切的文化联系。同时，两国政府表示愿意采取步骤，使它们自己同日本的关系正常化”。今年十月，周恩来总理在接见日本国会议员访华代表团和日本学术文化访华代表团时的谈话，也就是说明不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处，中国政府愿为中日两国早日恢复正常关系而努力。
    事实证明，日本爱好和平的人民是热烈欢迎中苏两国历次声明中所持的这种衷心维护和平的友好态度的。就在中苏关于对日本关系的联合宣言发表以后，日本争取同中国、苏联建立正常关系及开展贸易的运动，随着更加广泛地发展起来。日本政治、经济、文化界著名人士，在十月二十八日，组成了促进日本同中国、苏联恢复邦交运动的全国性机构，积极展开活动。“朝日新闻”在十月十三日的社论中写道：所有的日本人都希望日本同中国、苏联的关系正常化，而且相信日本和苏联可以和平共处。据最近一期的日本“世界杂志”所载，在读了周恩来总理和上述两个日本访华代表团的谈话记录后，右派社会党主席河上丈太郎发表意见说：周恩来总理的谈话说明中国是热望和平的。中国主张和平共处这是毫无疑问的。为了建立友好的邦交关系而继续努力，对于日本很为必要。前改进党议员北村德太郎说：我们很高兴十月十二日发表的中苏两国政府的关于对日本关系的联合宣言，它根据不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处的立场，给恢复日中、日苏邦交创造了一个开端。
    但是，日本人民的这种愿望，却一再为美国占领者和以吉田为首的日本一小撮顽固分子所阻挠。美国占领者为了美国少数金融寡头的利益，一直在阻碍着日本及其近邻——中苏两国——的接近。他们十分懂得，如果让日本同它的近邻接近，就会缓和它在经济上的困难，并从而促进它要求摆脱附属于美国的趋势。所以他们不惜采取各种卑鄙手段，从中破坏。当莫洛托夫外长发表了对日本关系问题的声明以后，美国国务院人士就公然表示，如果日本接受莫洛托夫外长的建议，那么“日美关系就要恶化”。美国侵略集团的这种无耻态度，充分说明他们要继续控制日本，不许日本为了本身的利益而采取任何独立的政策，以便把日本作为他们敌视中苏和加剧国际紧张局势的工具。美国占领者企图把日本长久放在他们控制之下的这种做法，不能不引起日本人民和全世界正义人士的同声愤慨。日本吉田内阁的倒台，就是它历年来执行追随美国的卖国政策所必然产生的结果。
    六年来，以吉田为首的日本一小撮顽固分子，始终追随美国，敌视中苏。他们促使日本的工业和财政依附于美国的军事订货，把美国占领者的“禁运”枷锁强加在日本人民的头上，以阻碍日本和中苏两国间贸易关系的开展。同时，他们压制日本人民要求同中苏恢复正常关系的呼声，并镇压日本人民要求独立、和平、民主的运动。吉田内阁的这一反动政策，给日本经济带来了严重的困难，并加深了日本对于美国的从属地位。因此，它不仅为日本人民所唾弃，而且也为日本资产阶级内部和自由党内部有识之士所反对。所以吉田内阁的倒台说明：屈从美国占领者的战争政策，是违反日本民族利益的，是不得人心的。日本人民坚决要求摆脱半被占领国的地位，发展自己的和平经济和民族文化，实行独立的外交政策，根据日本民族的利益，恢复和发展同它的邻国以及其他国家间的正常关系，从而致力于维护远东和世界和平的事业。今后，谁要违背日本人民的这一愿望，谁就要重蹈吉田的覆辙。
    自从吉田内阁下台以后，日本新政府在日本和中苏两国的关系问题上，表现了一些新的态度。除了上述外务相重光的声明以外，首相鸠山十九日在开始他的竞选旅行途中，进一步发表谈话说：应该采取步骤结束日本同中苏两国的战争状态，作为恢复关系的第一步，有关国家应该互换商务使节。日本新政府这一表示，显然是值得注意的，中华人民共和国一再声明，它愿意采取步骤，恢复和日本的正常关系。但是，十八日，外务相重光在参议院外务委员会答复在野党议员关于对日苏关系问题的质询时说：日本方面不能立即和苏联开始谈判，也不打算从日本方面询问具体条件。在回答关于日中关系问题时，他又说：这一关系取决于它和联合国、特别是和美国的关系，取决于国际形势，并表示日本政府现在还不打算考虑改变它对中国的态度。日本新政府的这一自相矛盾的态度，只能有两种解释：或者正如二十一日美联社东京消息所传的，鸠山、重光两氏的关于同苏联、中国恢复正常关系的说法，不外是“竞选性质的”；或者正为美国政府的压力所屈服。人们对于日本新政府所表现的这种态度，不能不引起对它的诚意的怀疑。
    在这方面，我们认为左、右两派社会党的态度是值得欢迎的。日本左、右两派社会党在二十七日发表的联合竞选纲领中指出：日本要同中苏两国恢复正常关系。又如左派社会党外交局局长佐多就说：“特别应该迅速实现恢复对中国和苏联的邦交，这是不需多说的。看到最近的国际形势，我国应该认真考虑关于日苏关系正常化的实际措施，立即开始和苏联谈判。”不过今天在日本，同时也存在着其他不少错误的看法。
    有些人听信吉田、冈崎等人的胡说，错误地认为中国和苏联关于同日本恢复正常关系的主张，是所谓“和平攻势”，没有什么实际意义。我们认为这种说法是不值一驳的。即使在吉田执政的时代，尽管吉田内阁一贯对我国采取敌视态度，但是我们中国人民，还是一再用行动表示了我们愿和日本友好的诚意。一九五二年六月，我国同日本国会议员高良富等签订了第一次中日贸易协议。次年十月，我国又同日本以池田正之辅为首的“国会议员促进日中贸易联盟”代表团，签订了又一次中日贸易协议。今年以来，中日贸易的数额，已有很大增加。一九五三年二月，我国应日本红十字会的要求，进行了同日本红十字会代表团关于协助愿回日本的在华日侨回日问题的谈判，截至目前止，我国已协助了在华日侨二万七千余人回到日本。当今年十月，周恩来总理接见日本两个访华代表团，回答代表所提问题时，又申明我们愿对日本战犯采取宽大政策，我们也愿同日本谈判渔业问题。难道人们能够把这一系列具体措施说成毫无实际意义，说成不是为恢复中日正常关系而作的真诚努力吗？事实同时证明，由于苏中两国及世界爱好和平人民的努力，已经使得朝鲜停战，印度支那恢复了和平，因而使当时的国际紧张局势获得了缓和。难道这些行动也能说成毫无实际意义，而是所谓“和平攻势”吗？
    还有那么一种糊涂的人，他们说，恢复苏日和中日正常关系的“时机还没有成熟”。这种话显然说明这种人没有足够的勇气，敢于确立日本独立自主的政策，只能看美国的眼色行事，敷衍舆论，欺骗人民。我们认为事实恰恰相反，正如日本无党派议员风见章在读了周恩来总理同日本两个访华代表团的谈话记录后所说的：“这个恢复邦交的时机，可以说已经成熟到了‘叩门即开’的程度。”人们认为，任何人如果是真诚地希望恢复苏日和中日正常关系的话，就应迅速响应莫洛托夫外长的声明。
    还有人说，日本如要同中苏两国恢复正常关系，首先就要切断它和美国的关系。我们认为这是没有根据的。关于这点，苏中对日本的联合宣言根本没有说过这样的话，连一个字也没有。因为苏联和中国的外交政策的原则是：一切不同社会制度的国家可以共处和促进同一切国家——包括日本在内——的实际事务关系。我们愿意本着平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权等项原则，采取步骤，同日本恢复正常关系。这一基本政策，我们是坚持的，过去是这样看法，今后更是如此。日本和任何国家建立或增进外交关系，这是日本的内政，我们完全无意干涉。我们所反对的，是美国政府的侵略政策，但我们对美国人民，始终是当作朋友看待的。我们所防备的，是美国利用日本作为侵略中国的军事基地。这一点我们相信日本的人民也应该是十分清楚的。因此问题十分明白，并不是中苏两国以日本断绝同美国的关系作为日本对中苏两国恢复正常关系的条件，而是美国在竭力破坏日本同中苏两国恢复正常关系的一切努力。最后，还有人胡说，准备把中国和台湾蒋介石匪帮，都承认为两个独立国家。人们应该记得，台湾是中国神圣领土的一部分，中国人民不解放台湾，决不罢休。从日本方面来说，日本同为中国人民所不齿的台湾蒋介石匪帮保持联系，这对日本有什么好处呢？蒋匪帮不仅为中国人民所唾弃，而且也为东南亚各国人民所深恶痛绝。蒋匪帮在东南亚国家进行颠覆活动，早已暴露于全世界。日本一方面希望同东方各国展开贸易，一方面又同蒋匪帮恋恋不舍。这种做法只会给日本带来损害。
    我们认为澄清了上述各种看法以后，可以肯定地说，恢复苏日和中日正常关系的时机，已经成熟了。我们欢迎一切有关恢复日本同我国正常关系所作的切实可行的措施。我们愿意采取步骤，恢复同日本的正常关系。同时我们希望日本新政府能以行动证实它对于恢复日本同中苏两国正常关系的诚意。周恩来总理在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议上业已明确地指出：“我国是愿意同日本建立正常关系的。如果日本政府也能抱有同样的愿望，并采取相应的措施，中国政府将准备采取步骤，来使中国同日本的关系正常化。中国政府主张同日本按照平等互利的原则，广泛发展贸易关系，并同日本建立密切的文化联系。”日本应该有它自己独立的外交政策，人们有理由认为，日本的政治领袖们，应该迅速作出符合于日本利益的决定。
