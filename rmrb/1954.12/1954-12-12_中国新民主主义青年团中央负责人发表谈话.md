    Talk by Responsible Person of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League
    The responsible person of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League issued a statement supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty."
    The statement said: Chairman Mao reminded us as early as June 1949: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their failure on this land of China." The US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is the most blatant manifestation of this unwillingness to accept defeat by imperialist elements and their running dogs.
    Those in the White House who are busy formulating war plans might as well recall where the eight million Chiang Kai-shek reactionary troops, equipped with US-made weapons, went five years ago? They might as well recall where more than 390,000 of the American invading troops who attacked Korea went? Such a recollection is very necessary for those hot-headed American generals.
    Why is it that after tasting the iron fist of the Chinese people's counterattack, US imperialism still dares to further bodyguard the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique by signing this treaty with them? Gamblers regard the Taiwan Strait as their amulet and place their bets on this "treasure." But the "treasure" the enemy is betting on is bound to lose. The strait is by no means an impregnable wall; the people are the masters of the sea. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan, and the Chinese people will overcome all difficulties and obstacles.
    The statement concluded: The Chinese youth, educated by the Chinese Communist Party, firmly supports Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The Chinese youth are determined to work hard with the people of the whole country, accelerate all preparations for the liberation of Taiwan, and undertake the sacred responsibility of defending the motherland and defending Asian and world peace. All members of the China New Democratic Youth League must stand at the forefront of this great struggle. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 中国新民主主义青年团中央负责人发表谈话

    中国新民主主义青年团中央负责人发表谈话
    中国新民主主义青年团中央负责人发表谈话，拥护周恩来外长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明。
    谈话说：毛主席早在一九四九年六月就提醒我们：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。”美蒋“共同防御条约”就是帝国主义分子和它的走狗们这种不甘心失败的最露骨的表现。
    白宫里忙着制订战争计划的人，不妨回忆一下五年前由美制武器装备起来的八百万蒋介石反动军队到哪里去了？更不妨回忆一下进攻朝鲜的美国侵略军中有三十九万多人又到哪里去了？这样的回忆对于那热昏头脑的美国将军很需要。
    美帝国主义在尝过中国人民的反击的铁拳之后，为什么还和蒋介石卖国集团订这个条约，敢更进一步为蒋介石卖国集团保镖呢？赌棍们把台湾海峡当作他们的护身符，把赌注押在这一“宝”上面。但敌人押的这一“宝”却是非输不可的。海峡决不是什么铜墙铁壁，人民才是海的主人。中国人民决定要解放台湾，中国人民就会克服一切困难和障碍。
    谈话最后说：为中国共产党所教导出来的中国青年，坚决拥护周恩来外长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明。中国青年决心和全国人民一道发奋工作，加紧解放台湾的一切准备，把保卫祖国，保卫亚洲和世界和平的神圣职责担当起来。中国新民主主义青年团的全体团员一定站在这一伟大斗争的前列。　　　（新华社）
