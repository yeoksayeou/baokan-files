Answers to Readers' Questions about the Accumulation of Public Property by Agricultural Production Cooperatives

Recently, we have received many letters from readers asking about the accumulation of public property and the distribution of income in agricultural production cooperatives. We are answering them individually as follows:

Comrade Hu Jiange from Tianjin and others ask: Should the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund of an agricultural production cooperative be deducted from the total income or from the net income after deducting production expenses? If deducted from the total income, wouldn't the production expenses also be included in the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund?

Answer: The methods for retaining public accumulation funds and public welfare funds vary greatly from place to place. Some cooperatives do not clearly distinguish between production funds, administrative expenses, and public accumulation/welfare funds, lumping them all together as "public accumulation funds." In this case, if we follow the principle of keeping the total public accumulation fund and public welfare fund to no more than 5% of the total income, as some regions stipulate, the portion that is truly used for public accumulation and welfare will be too small, because the 5% also includes production funds and administrative expenses. Some deduct production funds from the total income first, some deduct depreciation fees separately without including them in the public accumulation fund, and then deduct 5% from the net income as public accumulation and welfare funds. In this case, the public accumulation and welfare funds retained will exceed the prescribed proportion. For ease of calculation and comparison between different regions and cooperatives, it is better to uniformly deduct a certain percentage from the total income. Wouldn't this include production funds in the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund? This will not happen. Production funds are retained according to the actual needs of production. Whether the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund are deducted from the total income or retained from the net income, it does not affect the amount of production funds.

Comrade He Jinxiu from the Liaoning Provincial Department of Agriculture, Comrade Pang Guoan from Yingkou County, and others ask: Should the depreciation fee for fixed means of production in an agricultural production cooperative be deducted separately from the total income, or should it be deducted as part of the public accumulation fund, or as part of the production fund? Since the depreciation fee is used to compensate for the portion consumed in the current year's production, should it be deducted as the current year's production expense?

Answer: The purpose of the public accumulation fund is to maintain and increase the fixed means of production owned by the entire cooperative. The purpose of deducting depreciation fees is also to maintain the fixed means of production owned by the entire cooperative and should be used to offset consumption. However, "maintain" does not necessarily mean maintaining the original state. It does not mean that if a plow is broken, we must buy the same plow, nor does it mean repairing it. Depreciation fees can be used to purchase and update better fixed means of production. It is more convenient to include depreciation fees within the public accumulation fund for the rational use of depreciation fees. Some places stipulate that depreciation fees should be deducted as the current year's production expenses for the convenience of calculating production costs. It is also acceptable to calculate it that way, but it is not convenient in actual application. Depreciation fees are not used for repair expenses. The expenses required for repairing farm tools and treating livestock are retained as part of the production fund. According to their uses, the funds of an agricultural production cooperative can generally only be divided into four types: production funds, administrative expenses, public accumulation fund, and public welfare fund. According to its purpose, depreciation fees are only suitable to be placed in the public accumulation fund.

Comrade Zhao Chao from Jinxiang County, Shandong Province asks: There are many sources of public accumulation funds, including from agriculture and from sideline occupations. However, farm tools and livestock are used in agriculture. If the expenses and depreciation fees for buying farm tools and livestock are deducted from the public accumulation fund, wouldn't the agricultural aspect benefit unfairly? Shouldn't the depreciation fee only be deducted from agricultural income?

Answer: The agriculture and sideline occupations of an agricultural production cooperative support each other, are closely integrated, and are inseparable. Some cooperative members can specialize in sideline production because their land is managed uniformly by the entire cooperative. Therefore, in principle, the income from agriculture and sideline occupations should be distributed uniformly (among which, sideline occupations directly related to land should be distributed jointly by labor and land after deducting production funds, administrative expenses, public accumulation fund, and public welfare fund together with agricultural income; sideline occupations unrelated to land should be distributed uniformly by the entire cooperative's labor force after deducting production funds, etc.). Depreciation fees are not only deducted for fixed means of production used in agriculture, but also for fixed means of production used in sideline occupations. The public accumulation fund is not only used to purchase fixed means of production for agriculture, but can also be used to purchase fixed means of production for sideline occupations.

Comrade Pang Guoan from Yingkou County asks: When an agricultural production cooperative distributes income, it must retain production funds for the coming year from the total income. However, in some cooperatives here, if too much is retained, it will reduce the actual income of the cooperative members; if too little is retained, it will not be enough for the coming year. Especially this year, the old cooperatives have expanded, and many new cooperative members have been added, making the production funds even more insufficient. After discussions by the county and district committees, it was determined that the amount of production funds to be retained should be determined based on the increase in production of each cooperative this year. Those with more production increase should retain more. If it is not enough, new cooperative members can be mobilized to contribute some production funds for the coming year, without repaying the principal or interest. If it is still not enough, new and old cooperative members can be mobilized to invest, and this portion of the investment will be repaid with principal and interest after the harvest next year. Is this correct?

Answer: This is acceptable. Newly established cooperatives, which repay more of the previously borrowed production investment when distributing income this year, or cooperatives with poor harvests this year, can retain less production funds as appropriate. However, the seeds needed for the next year should all be retained by the cooperative by selecting improved varieties. If not enough seeds are retained, there will be great difficulties at the time of sowing. Even if it is possible to buy them, they will not be as good as specially selected improved varieties. In the future, with the development of production, we should gradually achieve the goal of retaining all the production funds needed for the coming year every year. If the cooperative expands and needs more production funds, new cooperative members should pay shares as production funds according to the methods of the old cooperative members; however, the general new and old cooperative members should be persuaded, and individual poor new cooperative members should be taken care of.

Comrade Nong Zhenting from Daxin County, Guangxi Province asks: The autumn harvest distribution plan of the "Shuguang" Agricultural Production Cooperative published in the "People's Daily" on September 10th said: It is determined to deduct the total investment of the current year's production from the total income, and then deduct 5% of the net income for the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund, and the remainder is completely distributed to the cooperative members at 60% for labor and 40% for land. Does the net income mentioned here include the increased production part and the sideline income? Why should the land also receive a share of the increased production part and the sideline income? Is it possible to deduct 40% of the income from the land based on the originally assessed land yield, and then add the remaining 60% to the increased production part and the net sideline income part as the labor income?

Answer: This opinion is basically correct. But it should be noted that the total income mentioned in the "Shuguang" cooperative's distribution plan only refers to the agricultural aspect. Some sideline incomes are also directly related to the land, and the land can also receive a share of such sideline income at an appropriate proportion. Sideline income unrelated to the land should naturally not be shared by the land, but should be combined with the income of the entire cooperative's labor force and distributed to the entire cooperative's labor force. It is reasonable to allocate the output from agriculture that exceeds the assessed land yield entirely to labor. If the cooperative members all agree, it is naturally feasible. Some people in cooperatives with more land are temporarily unwilling to implement this method; it is also possible to make some concessions to these people and implement a method of determining the distribution ratio of labor and land for the part exceeding the assessed yield; we can wait until everyone's awareness has been raised before changing to a more rational method.

    关于农业生产合作社积累公共财产的一些问题
    近来我们收到不少读者来信，询问关于农业生产合作社积累公共财产和分配收益的一些问题，分别答复如下：
    天津市胡建阁同志等问：农业生产合作社的公积金、公益金应从总收入中扣除呢？还是应从扣除生产开支以后的纯收入中扣除？如果从总收入中扣除，不是连生产开支也扣了公积金、公益金了吗？
    答：对于公积金、公益金应当怎样留，各地的作法是很不一致的。有的社没有把生产资金、行政管理费和公积金、公益金分清楚，笼统地把这些都称为“公积金”。这样，按照有些地区规定的公积金、公益金总共不超过总收入的百分之五的原则来留，实际上留的真正作公积金、公益金用的部分就太少了，因为百分之五之中还包括了生产资金和行政管理费。有的把生产资金先从总收入中扣除，有的把折旧费不算作公积金的一部分而另行扣除，然后再从纯收入中扣百分之五作公积金、公益金。这样，留的公积金、公益金就要超过规定的比例了。为了便于计算，便于各地各社比较，还是以统一按照总收入的百分之几来扣除为好。这样不是连生产资金也扣了公积金、公益金吗？这是不会的。生产资金是按照生产的实际需要留出的；不论公积金公益金是从总收入中扣还是从纯收入中留，对生产资金的多少是没有什么影响的。
    辽宁省农业厅贺进修同志、营口县庞国安同志等问：农业生产合作社的固定生产资料的折旧费应从总收入中单独扣除呢？还是应作为公积金的一部分扣除？还是作为生产资金的一部分扣除？折旧费既是为了弥补当年生产中已消耗的部分用的，是不是应作为当年生产开支扣除？
    答：公积金的用途就是保持和增加全社公有的固定生产资料；扣折旧费的用意，也就是保持全社公有的固定生产资料，是应当用来抵补消耗的。不过，所谓“保持”，并不一定是保持原样，不是坏了一张犁一定照买同样一张犁，也不是修补。折旧费是可以用以添置更新更好的固定生产资料的。把折旧费包括在公积金以内，对于合理地使用折旧费是更方便的。有的地方规定把折旧费作为当年生产开支来扣除，是为了计算生产成本的方便，那样算也是可以的，但实际应用起来却不方便。折旧费并不是作修理费用的；修理农具、医治牲畜等所需的费用，是作为生产资金的一部分留下的。农业生产合作社的资金，按它们的用途，一般的只可分做四种，即：生产资金，行政管理费，公积金，公益金。折旧费，按它的用途来说，只有放在公积金里才合适。
    山东省金乡县赵超同志问：公积金的来源很多，有从农业来的，也有从副业来的。可是，农具、牲口本是农业方面用的；如果买农具牲口的用费和折旧费从公积金中扣除，农业方面岂不沾了光？折旧费只从农业收入中扣除不就对了吗？
    答：农业生产合作社的农业和副业是相互支援，密切结合，不可分离的。一部分社员能专门从事副业生产，是因为他们的土地有全社统一经营。因此，农业和副业的收入，在原则上应当统一分配（其中同土地直接有关的副业，应当在和农业收入一起扣除生产资金、行政管理费、公积金、公益金以后由劳力和土地共同分配；同土地无关的副业，应在除去生产资金等等以后由全社劳动力统一分配）。折旧费并不是只有农业用的固定生产资料才扣，副业用的固定生产资料也是要扣的。公积金不只是用在添置农业的固定生产资料上，也可以用在添置副业的固定生产资料上。
    营口县庞国安同志问：农业生产合作社在分配收入时要从总收入中留出来年的生产资金。可是，我们这里有些社，如果留多了，就会使社员减少实际收入；如果留少了，来年又会不够用。特别是今年老社扩大了，增加了很多新社员，生产资金就更不够用了。经过县委区委讨论，确定：依据各社今年生产增加的情形来决定留生产资金的多少，增产多的就多留些。如果不够，可以发动新社员拿出一些来年的生产资金，本利都不再还。如果还不够，就发动新老社员投资，这一部分投资到明年收获后还本还利。这样做对不对？
    答：这样做是可以的。初办的社，今年分配收入时归还以前暂借的生产投资较多，或者今年收成不好，生产资金可以酌情少留。但是，下年度需要的种籽是应当选择优良品种全部由社留出的。如果种籽不留够，到播种时就会碰到很大困难，即使能设法买到，也不会有特别选留的良种好。往后，随着生产的发展，应逐步做到每年把来年所需要的生产资金全部留出。社扩大了，需要的生产资金多，新社员是应当按照老社员的办法缴纳作为生产资金的股份金的；不过，应说服一般的新老社员，对个别贫苦的新社员加以照顾。
    广西省大新县农振廷同志问：“人民日报”九月十日登载的“曙光”农业生产合作社的秋收分配方案中说：确定从总收入中除去本年生产的总投资，再从纯收入里扣除百分之五的公积金和公益金，其余按劳力六成土地四成完全分配给社员。这里所说的纯收入中，是否包括增产的部分和副业收入呢？增产的部分和副业收入，土地为什么也要分一份？把土地上的收入以原来评定的土地产量扣出四成，其余的六成加上增产部分和副业纯收入部分，作为劳动力的收益，可以吗？
    答：这个意见基本上是正确的。但应注意：“曙光”社的分配方案中所说的总收入，是只就农业方面说的。副业收入也有和土地有直接关系的，这种副业的收入，土地也可以按适当比例分一份。同土地无关的副业收入，土地自然不应当分，而应当和全社劳动力的收入统一起来归全社劳动力分配。农业方面的产量超过土地评产的产量的，完全归劳动力分配，是合理的，如果社员们都同意，自然可行。有的社的土地较多的人暂时还不愿实行这种办法；对这些人稍作些让步，实行超过评产的部分另定劳动力和土地的分配比例的办法，也是可以的；可以等待大家的觉悟都提高了以后，再改变为更合理的办法。
