Stalin's Great Contribution to Building a Socialist Society in the Workers' State
Ai Siqi

Today is the 75th anniversary of the birth of Stalin, the great successor of Lenin's cause. We commemorate this day with extremely high feelings of gratitude.

The Chinese people will never forget Stalin's great concern and cordial assistance to the Chinese revolutionary movement and the socialist construction of New China. The Marxist-Leninist theory inherited and developed by Stalin, and the successful experience of the Soviet Communist Party in leading the Soviet people to build a socialist society, have given our people, who are fighting for the realization of socialism, infinite strength.

Among the Marxist-Leninist theories inherited and developed by Stalin, and in the experience of the Soviet people in building a socialist society, the theory and experience of the working class using state power to build socialism are of great significance.

We know that Marx and Engels had long put forward the idea that the working class must seize state power to build socialism. Marx pointed out in the "Critique of the Gotha Program" that there must be a transition period from capitalist society to socialist society, and that the task of socialist construction must be realized under the leadership of the working class's regime during this transition period. In the era of Marx and Engels, these scientific predictions could not become a reality. Although the Paris Commune's workers' regime appeared in 1871, it failed in a very short period of time. Only in Lenin's era, the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, was the working class's regime first established after the Russian Revolution.

Lenin stipulated the principle that "the basic issue of the revolution is the issue of state power." Stalin further extended and specifically demonstrated this principle. Stalin pointed out that the meaning of this principle is not "limited to seizing power," "the whole thing lies in maintaining power, consolidating power, and making it invincible." [1] Stalin pointed out that the reason why the working class must maintain and consolidate power is to complete the transition to a socialist society after the victory of the revolution. The working class needs to use state power to perform three important functions: one, "suppressing the overthrown classes at home," two, "defending the country against foreign aggression," and three, "the economic organization and cultural education work of state organs, the purpose of which is to develop the sprouts of a new socialist economy and re-educate the people in a socialist spirit" [2]. After Lenin's death, the Soviet Communist Party, headed by Stalin, guided the Soviet government to correctly realize these functions of the state during the transition period, thus ensuring the realization of the task of socialist construction in the Soviet Union.

The working class using the power of the state to realize socialist construction is a very complex and arduous task. Because, first, this is to eliminate all forms of exploitation, and not to replace one form of exploitation with another, as was the case in previous revolutions, which cannot but arouse the desperate resistance of the exploiting classes; second, socialist economic forms did not exist at all or almost not exist at all before the working class gained power. The working-class state "must create new socialist economic forms on the so-called 'empty space'." [3] The Soviet state, the Soviet working class, still completed this difficult and complex task very well. What is the secret? Stalin tells us that there is no secret. It is only that the working-class party seriously relies on objectively existing economic laws, mainly relying on "the economic law that the relations of production must be adapted to the nature of the productive forces," to use the power of the state to carry out its work, so as to win victory in that complex and difficult struggle.

How does the working class's regime rely on this objective law to create new socialist economic forms? This is to formulate a series of correct policy lines for the state to conform to this objective law. Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party headed by Stalin, the Soviet working class correctly formulated the policy line for the transition period for its own country in accordance with this principle. The most basic of these are: (1) the policy of socialist industrialization of the state; (2) the policy of agricultural collectivization. The Soviet working class, through these state policies, led the people of the whole country to create new socialist economic forms. We know that the policy of socialist industrialization is contrary to the capitalist industrialization method of starting with light industry first, but instead starts with the construction of heavy industry to carry out national industrialization. The implementation of the policy of socialist industrialization enabled the Soviet Union to equip its domestic industry and agriculture with advanced technology in a very short period of time, transforming the Soviet Union from a poor and backward agricultural country with a weak national defense into an advanced industrial power with a prosperous people's livelihood, economic independence, and a consolidated national defense, enabling the Soviet Union to thoroughly smash the fascist group's aggression, which relied on the reactionary forces of the whole of Europe as its reserve, almost solely with its own strength. As for the policy of agricultural collectivization, it transformed the Soviet Union in a few years into "huge collective farms that can adopt new technologies, utilize all agronomic achievements, and provide the country with a large amount of commercial agricultural products." [4] This enabled the development of Soviet agriculture to adapt to the needs of socialist industrial development, and the material and cultural life of Soviet peasants to improve day by day, avoiding the sinful phenomenon of poverty and bankruptcy of small farmers caused by the development of capitalist agriculture.

The Soviet Union implemented the policies of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization for the first time in human history, enabling socialist construction to be victorious in one country first. During the transition period in the Soviet Union, the initial formulation of these policies encountered great resistance. The Soviet Communist Party, headed by Stalin, resolutely defended the policies of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, crushed the various fallacies and sabotage conspiracies of the opposition, and formulated the state's five-year construction plan entirely in accordance with the guidelines of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, thus ensuring the victory of the working class's socialist construction cause.

Building a socialist system means eliminating all exploitative systems, and therefore inevitably leads to desperate resistance in various forms from the exploiting classes. The opposition's conspiratorial activities against socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization during the Soviet transition period were a manifestation of the exploiting classes' resistance and attempts at restoration. The working class must use state power to crush this resistance and attempts at restoration by the exploiters in order to ensure the victory of socialist construction. What forces did the Soviet working class rely on to enable its country to complete this acute task of struggle? On this question, Stalin, based on the basic principles laid down by Lenin and based on the experience of Soviet socialist construction, gave us the final conclusion: it relied on the power of "the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, which constitutes the overwhelming majority of society." [5] The reason why the Soviet working class was able to completely defeat the resistance and restoration attempts of the exploiters was because the Soviet state power already had such power. Stalin tells us that, according to Lenin's basic ideas, the working class's regime should at the same time be "a special form of alliance between the leading proletariat and the led non-proletarian exploited masses (peasants, etc.)." [6] The working class's regime must embody this leadership of the working class over the peasantry and this alliance between the working class and the peasantry, in order to become an invincible force in crushing the resistance of the exploiters and ensuring the completion of the cause of socialist construction. Under the leadership of Lenin, Stalin, and the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet working class established a working-class regime that embodies the alliance between the working class and the peasantry. Such a regime is a regime led by the working class, and at the same time it is the most democratic regime in the world. It is "the highest type of democracy in class society, a form of proletarian democracy representing the interests of the majority (the exploited), which is completely opposed to capitalist democracy representing the interests of the minority (the exploiters)." [7] Such a democratic regime has incomparable superiority, because it can bring the creativity and enthusiasm of the broadest masses of the working people to the fullest extent, and the power it manifests can destroy any resistance from the exploiters and overcome any difficulties in the process of socialist construction.

Under the leadership of Lenin, Stalin, and the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet working class not only built its country into a state of the highest degree of democratic worker-peasant alliance, but also built it into a state where all nationalities within the country are united in brotherly friendship. Socialist construction is a cause of the common interests of the working class and the broad working people of any nation, and the socialist state firmly unites all nations into a close-knit family based on the common interests of these broad people. In the Soviet Union, the patriotism of the people of the whole country towards the socialist motherland is completely consistent with the spirit of internationalism of solidarity among all nationalities. Stalin's developed Marxist-Leninist theory on the national question profoundly and comprehensively demonstrates the consistency of this patriotism and internationalism of the working class. Stalin said: "In Soviet patriotism, the national traditions of all nationalities are harmoniously coordinated with the common and vital interests of all workers in the Soviet Union." [8] The relationship of mutual love and close cooperation among all nationalities enables the working-class state to gather the strength of all nationalities within the country to work together for the cause of socialist construction, making the Soviet Union a country with unprecedented internal unity and consolidation in history.

The correct policy of the working-class-led state in international relations is also an important link in guaranteeing socialist construction. To complete the great cause of socialist construction, unprecedented in human history, requires a peaceful international environment, which is easy to understand. Therefore, the Soviet Union has always unswervingly adhered to a policy of peaceful diplomacy. Those reactionary politicians in imperialist countries who fabricated the myth of so-called "communist aggression" do not really believe their own words in reality. The policy of peaceful diplomacy of the Soviet Union was announced to the world immediately after the victory of the October Revolution. Stalin, inheriting Lenin, led the Soviet Union in implementing this diplomatic policy. Even on the eve of the fascist group's attack on the Soviet Union, when Hitler's German troops were rampaging through Europe and igniting the flames of war, Stalin still solemnly declared the Soviet Union's unswerving policy of peaceful diplomacy in his summary report on the work of the CPSU (B) Central Committee at the Eighteenth Party Congress. Stalin led the Soviet state to consistently adhere to the policy of peaceful diplomacy, and tirelessly struggled to defend world peace against the instigation of war with countries all over the world. The Soviet Union's policy of peaceful diplomacy is based on the essential needs of the working-class state, and is by no means due to weakness or fear. Because the imperialist war instigators are irrational, the working-class state needs to prepare a strong national defense force to deal with the imperialists' crazy adventures. And because of the success of the policy of socialist industrialization, the Soviet Union has obtained the material basis for a strong national defense force sufficient to defend its own country. As everyone knows, in World War II, the beastly fascist group's army was completely crushed in front of the national defense forces of the Soviet state. As for the Soviet Union, after defeating the fascist aggression, it continued to adhere to the policy of striving for peaceful coexistence with countries of different systems, and continued to struggle with the people all over the world to defend world peace.

We, the Chinese people, are engaged in socialist construction and socialist transformation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. Stalin's inherited and developed Marxist-Leninist theory on building socialism, as well as the experience of the Soviet working class in using state power to build a socialist society, indicates the basic direction for us. The Chinese Communist Party has long put forward the general line for the transition period in the country, and this general line is the line of realizing socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization through China's own specific road. We have established a people's democratic state power based on the worker-peasant alliance to organize the forces of the people of the whole country to fight for the realization of the general line. We have established a relationship of friendship, mutual assistance, and close unity among all nationalities in our own country; we are constantly striving to realize the five principles of peaceful diplomacy in the international arena. These are basically consistent with the road the Soviet Union has taken. We must strive to study Stalin's theory, study the experience of Stalin leading the Soviet working class in using state power to build a socialist society, so that the people of our country will be able to move more accurately and smoothly on the road from a new democratic society to a socialist society.

    斯大林对工人阶级国家建成社会主义社会的伟大贡献
    艾思奇
    今天是列宁事业的伟大继承者——斯大林诞生的七十五周年。我们以极端崇高的感激之情来纪念这个日子。
    中国人民永远不会忘记斯大林给与中国革命运动和新中国社会主义建设的伟大的关怀和亲切的援助。斯大林所继承和发展了的马克思列宁主义学说，苏联共产党领导苏联人民建设社会主义社会的成功经验，使得为着实现社会主义事业而斗争的我国人民获得无穷的力量。
    在斯大林所继承和发展了的马克思列宁主义学说中，在苏联人民建设社会主义社会的经验中，工人阶级运用国家政权来建设社会主义的学说和经验，具有着重大的意义。
    我们知道，马克思、恩格斯早已提出工人阶级必须掌握国家政权才能建设社会主义的思想。马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中指出由资本主义社会到社会主义社会，必须要有一个过渡时期，这个过渡时期是要在工人阶级的政权领导之下实现社会主义建设的任务的。在马克思恩格斯的时代，这些科学的预见没有能够成为事实，虽然一八七一年出现过巴黎公社的工人政权，但在很短的时期内就失败了。只有到了列宁的时代，帝国主义和无产阶级革命的时代，工人阶级的政权才第一次在俄国革命之后确立起来。
    列宁曾规定了“革命的基本问题是政权问题”这一个原理。斯大林进一步引伸和具体地论证了这个原理。斯大林指出这个原理的意思不是“只限于取得政权”，“全部事情都在于要保持政权，巩固政权，使它成为不可战胜的。”〔一〕，斯大林指出工人阶级之所以必须保持和巩固政权，是因为为着在革命胜利后完成向社会主义社会的过渡。工人阶级需要应用政权来执行三个重要的职能：一、“镇压国内已被推翻的阶级”，二、“保卫国家以防外来的侵犯”，三、“国家各机关的经济组织工作和文化教育工作，其目的是要发展社会主义新经济的萌芽，并以社会主义精神重新教育人民”〔二〕。在列宁逝世后，以斯大林为首的苏联共产党指导着苏联政府正确地实现了过渡时期国家的这些职能，这样就保证在苏联实现了社会主义建设的任务。
    工人阶级运用政权力量来实现社会主义建设，这是非常复杂而艰巨的工作。因为，第一，这是要消灭一切剥削制度，而不是用一种剥削制度代替另一种剥削制度，如像以前的革命时的情形那样，这不能不引起剥削阶级拚命的反抗；第二，社会主义经济形式在工人阶级获得政权以前是完全不存在或几乎完全不存在的。工人阶级国家“必得在所谓‘空地上’创造新的社会主义的经济形式”〔三〕。这样困难而复杂的任务，苏联的国家，苏联的工人阶级还是很好地把它完成了。这有什么秘诀呢？斯大林告诉我们，这并没有什么秘诀。而只是工人阶级的党认真依靠着客观存在的经济法则，主要是依靠着“生产关系一定要适合生产力性质这个经济法则”来运用国家政权的力量进行工作，才能在那复杂而困难的斗争中获得胜利。
    工人阶级的政权如何依靠这个客观法则来创造起新的社会主义经济形式呢？这就是要为国家制定一系列的正确的政策路线，使之符合于这个客观法则。在以斯大林为首的苏联共产党的领导之下，苏联的工人阶级曾按照这个原则为自己的国家正确地制定了过渡时期的政策路线。其中最基本的就是：（一）社会主义国家工业化的政策；（二）农业集体化的政策。苏联的工人阶级，就是通过这些国家的政策来领导全国人民创造新的社会主义经济形式的。我们知道，社会主义工业化的政策，就是与首先从轻工业开始的资本主义工业化方法相反，而是首先从重工业的建设开始，来进行国家工业化的方法。实行了社会主义工业化的政策，就使苏联能够在很短的时期用高度的技术把国内的工农业装备起来，使苏联由贫穷落后、国防力量薄弱的农业国一跃而为人民生活富裕、经济独立和国防巩固的先进工业强国，使苏联能够几乎只以自己单独的力量彻底粉碎了依靠全欧洲反动势力为后备的法西斯集团的侵略。至于说到农业集体化的政策，那么，它曾经在几年之内就使苏联“全国布满了能够采用新技术，利用一切农学成绩，而多多供给国家商品农产物的巨大集体农庄”〔四〕，使苏联农业的发展能够适应社会主义工业发展的需要，使苏联农民的物质和文化生活日益提高，避免了资本主义农业发展中那种引起小农贫穷破产的罪恶现象。
    苏联在人类历史上破天荒第一次实行了社会主义工业化和农业集体化的政策，使社会主义建设在一个国家内首先得到了胜利。在苏联的过渡时期，最初制定这些政策的时候，曾遭遇到很大的反抗。以斯大林为首的苏联共产党坚决保卫了社会主义工业化和农业集体化的政策，粉碎了反对派的种种谬论和破坏阴谋，完全按照社会主义工业化和农业集体化的方针制订了国家的五年建设计划，因此就保证了工人阶级的社会主义建设事业的胜利。
    建设社会主义制度即是要消灭一切剥削制度，因此必然要引起剥削阶级各种形式的拚命反抗。苏联过渡时期中反对派反对社会主义工业化及农业集体化的阴谋活动，即是剥削阶级进行反抗和企图复辟的一种表现。工人阶级必须运用国家政权来粉碎这种剥削者的反抗和复辟企图，以保证社会主义建设的胜利。苏联工人阶级是依靠了什么力量来使自己的国家完成这种尖锐的斗争任务呢？对这个问题，斯大林依据列宁已奠定的基本原理，依据苏联社会主义建设的经验，给我们作了最后的结论说：是依靠了“占社会绝大多数的工人阶级和农民的联盟”〔五〕的力量。苏联工人阶级之所以能完全战胜剥削者的反抗行为和复辟企图，就是因为苏联的国家政权已经有了这样的力量。斯大林告诉我们：按照列宁的基本思想，工人阶级的政权应该同时就是“领导者无产阶级和被领导者非无产阶级被剥削群众（农民等等）的特种形式的联盟”〔六〕。工人阶级的政权必须体现着工人阶级对农民的这种领导权和工人阶级和农民之间的这种联盟，才能成为粉碎剥削者的反抗和保证社会主义建设事业完成的无敌力量。苏联工人阶级在列宁、斯大林和苏联共产党的领导之下，建立了这种体现着工人阶级和农民之间的联盟的工人阶级政权。这样的政权是工人阶级所领导的政权，同时又是世界上最民主的政权，它是“阶级社会中民主的最高类型，是代表多数人（被剥削者）利益的无产阶级民主的形式，它和代表少数人（剥削者）利益的资本主义民主是完全相反的”〔七〕。这样的民主政权有着无比的优越性，因为它能把最广大劳动人民群众的创造性和积极性发挥尽致，它所表现的力量能在社会主义建设的过程中摧毁剥削者的任何反抗和克服任何困难。
    在列宁、斯大林和苏联共产党的领导下，苏联工人阶级不仅把自己的国家建设成最高度民主的工农联盟的国家，并且还建设成国内各民族兄弟般地友好团结的国家。社会主义建设是任何民族的工人阶级和广大劳动人民共同利益的事业，社会主义的国家就在这广大人民共同利益的基础上把各民族巩固地联合成为一个亲密合作的大家庭。在苏联，全国人民对于社会主义祖国的爱国主义与各民族团结的国际主义精神是完全一致的。斯大林所发展的马克思列宁主义关于民族问题的学说，深刻地全面地论证了工人阶级的这种爱国主义和国际主义的一致。斯大林说：“在苏维埃爱国主义中，各族人民的民族传统是与苏联一切劳动者的共同切身利益和谐地配合着的。”〔八〕各民族的相互友爱和亲密合作的关系，使工人阶级的国家能够集合国内一切民族的力量同心协力地来为社会主义建设事业奋斗，使苏联成为历史上空前未有的内部团结巩固的国家。
    工人阶级领导的国家在国际关系上的正确政策，也是保证社会主义建设的一个重要环节。要完成人类史上空前未有的社会主义建设的伟大事业，需要有和平的国际环境，这是很容易明白的。所以苏联在外交上始终不渝地坚守着和平的外交政策。那些捏造所谓“共产主义侵略”的神话的帝国主义国家的反动政客们，他们在实际上也并不真的相信自己的话。苏联的和平外交政策的方针，是在十月革命胜利后立刻就向全世界宣布了。斯大林继承着列宁领导苏联贯彻了这个外交政策。就是在法西斯集团进攻苏联的前夜，希特勒德国军队已在欧洲横冲直撞，而挑起了战争火焰的时候，斯大林仍在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告中，郑重申明了苏联的始终不渝的和平外交方针。斯大林领导苏联国家一贯地坚守和平外交的方针，并且不懈地为着保卫世界和平反对战争挑拨与全世界各国共同奋斗。苏联的和平外交政策是基于工人阶级的国家的本质的需要，决不是因为软弱害怕。由于帝国主义战争挑拨者是没有理性的，工人阶级的国家就需要准备着强大的国防力量来对付帝国主义者的疯狂冒险。而由于社会主义国家工业化政策的成功，苏联就获得了足以保卫自己国家的强大国防力量的物质基础。大家知道，在第二次世界大战中野兽般的法西斯集团军队就是在苏联国家的国防力量前面碰得完全粉碎的。至于苏联，则在打败法西斯侵略以后仍继续遵守着力求与不同制度的国家和平共处的方针，仍继续为着保卫世界和平而与全世界人民共同奋斗着。
    我们中国人民在中国共产党和人民政府的领导之下从事着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，斯大林所继承和发展了的马克思列宁主义关于建设社会主义的学说，以及苏联工人阶级运用国家政权来建成社会主义社会的经验，给我们指示着基本的方向。中国共产党早已提出了在国家过渡时期的总路线，这总路线就是通过中国自己的具体的道路来实现社会主义国家工业化和农业集体化的任务的路线。我们建立了以工农联盟为基础的人民民主的国家政权来组织全国人民的力量为实现总路线而奋斗。我们在自己国内各民族之间树立了友爱互助亲密团结的关系；我们在国际上正在为着实现和平外交的五项原则而不断地努力着。这些都和苏联所走过的道路是基本一致的。我们要努力学习斯大林的学说，学习斯大林领导苏联工人阶级运用国家政权建成社会主义社会的经验，这样就会使我国人民在由新民主主义社会过渡到社会主义社会的道路上走得更为准确，更为顺利。
