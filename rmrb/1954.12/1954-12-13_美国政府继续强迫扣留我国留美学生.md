　　Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The U.S. government continues to forcibly detain Chinese students studying in the United States. A U.S. State Department spokesman publicly announced on the 11th that the U.S. government has refused to allow thirty-five Chinese students seeking to return to their homeland to do so.

　　United Press International reporter Gonzales reported from Washington on the 10th that, according to U.S. officials, the U.S. government issued an order in June 1950, when the Korean War broke out, stipulating that all 4,500 Chinese students were not allowed to return to China. After the end of the Korean War, the United States refused to allow approximately 124 Chinese students who requested to return to China to do so.
