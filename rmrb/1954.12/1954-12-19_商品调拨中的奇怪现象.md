    Strange Phenomena in Commodity Allocation
    Li Fengchun
    In early November, the Taigu Working Group of the Shanxi Provincial Department Store helped the Taigu County Department Store clear its warehouse and discovered that the chaotic phenomena in the allocation and transportation of commodities were very serious. The following are some examples:
    In late September, the Taigu County Department Store received 748 dozens of woolen underwear sets transferred from the Yuci County Central Store, of which 680 dozens were woolen trousers, far more trousers than tops. Among the woolen trousers, 670 dozens were only suitable for children in their teens. Such a large batch of children's woolen trousers, despite the Taigu County Department Store's best efforts to promote them, and after distributing 100 dozens to other county department stores, still left over 100 dozens in stock. At the same time, woolen trousers for adults and children under ten years old were out of stock for a long time and could not be supplied.
    Taigu County is a small city, but it successively received 15 rolls of 240,000 yuan per meter navy serge, more than 200 high-quality cotton monkey coats and long-haired plush cotton monkey coats, and even in November, summer goods such as spun silk and tussah silk were still being shipped in.
    One box of No. 34 enamel washbasins produced by the Hankou No. 212 Factory was soaked by rainwater on its way to Taigu, saturating the lining straw and the paper between the basins, causing all the basins to stick together. In addition, the empty space inside the box widened, and all ten dozens of basins were damaged by the impact.
    In addition, sometimes the goods have been shipped to the sales destination, but the sales unit has not arrived, so they still cannot be sold; or because the transfer order is not filled out accurately, the goods and the order do not match, making it impossible to count them and promptly sell them. For example, a transfer order stated that 100 dozens each of 85 cm and 90 cm woolen tops were being transferred, but the actual transfer was 45 dozens of 85 cm woolen tops, 110 dozens of 90 cm woolen tops, and 170 dozens of other brands of woolen tops. After the goods arrived, inquiries were made everywhere, causing many difficulties for sales work. Another time, a train car was loaded with 15 boxes each of milk powder and condensed milk, 4 boxes of biscuits, and 9 pieces of candy, but only candy was written on the shipping label, creating a chaotic situation of goods without orders or mismatched orders and goods.
    According to their statistics, as many as 46 similar incidents occurred in mid- and late October. This chaotic phenomenon has caused losses to state property and prevented consumers from quickly buying daily necessities that they could have otherwise obtained.
    In response to the above situation, the Taigu Working Group of the Shanxi Provincial Department Store proposed the following methods to solve these problems and prevent further errors and losses: For goods that are not suitable or not suitable for the season, internal adjustments should be organized; when higher-level companies distribute materials, business personnel should carefully review them to ensure that goods that are truly suitable for rural needs are given priority for supply to rural areas, and close attention should be paid to the matching of commodity varieties and specifications to meet the actual needs of people at all levels. In addition, regulations should be established for handling errors and accidents in the allocation and transportation links, and the regulations for one order per item and the simultaneous delivery of orders and goods must be resolutely implemented.

### 商品调拨中的奇怪现象

    商品调拨中的奇怪现象
    李逢春
    山西省百货公司太谷工作组，十一月上旬帮助太谷县百货商店清理仓库时发现百货商品调拨运输工作中的混乱现象很严重。下面就是其中的一些例子：
    九月下旬，太谷县百货商店接到榆次县中心商店调来的绒衣裤七百四十八打，其中有六百八十打是绒裤，裤子比上衣多得多。而绒裤中又有六百七十打是只能给十多岁的儿童穿用的。这样一大批儿童绒裤，太谷县百货商店虽尽力推销，又分给外县百货商店一百打，最后还积压了一百多打。和这同时，大人和十岁以下小孩穿用的绒裤，却长期脱销，无货供应。
    太谷县是一个小城市，可是先后接到二十四万元一公尺的海军呢十五卷，质量高贵的棉猴和长毛绒棉猴二百多件，甚至到了十一月，还陆续运来了纺绸、柞绸等夏令商品。
    汉口二一二工厂生产的三四素面盆一箱，在运送到太谷的途中，雨水把箱内衬草和盆与盆间的衬纸浸透，使所有面盆粘合在一起了，加上箱内空隙扩大，十打面盆全部震荡损坏。
    此外，有时货物虽然已运到销地，但销货单位没有到，依然不能推销；或因不按实填写调货单，货、单不符，无法清点，也不能及时推销。例如一张调货单上写着八十五公分和九十公分的绒衣各一百打，实际调来的却是八十五公分的绒衣四十五打，九十公分的绒衣一百一十打，其他牌号的绒衣一百七十打。货到后辗转查询，给销货工作造成很多困难。又有一次，一个车皮内装运奶粉、炼乳各十五箱，饼干四箱，糖果九件，但托运标签上只写着糖果，这样就造成了有单无货或单货不符的混乱现象。
    根据他们的统计，类似以上所举的事情，十月中旬和下旬就发生了四十六件之多。这种混乱现象，使国家财产遭到损失，也使消费者不能很快买到本来可以买到的日用品。
    山西省百货公司太谷工作组，针对以上情况，提出了解决这些问题和防止差错损失事故继续发生的办法如下：对于货不对路和不适合季节的商品，应组织内部调剂；上级公司下放物资，要经业务负责人员慎重审查，做到把真正适合农村需要的商品尽先调配给农村供应，并十分注意商品品种、规格的搭配，必须适应各阶层人民的实际需要。此外，应规定调拨运输环节中发生差错事故的处理办法，并坚决贯彻一货一单和单货同行的规定。
