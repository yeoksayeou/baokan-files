In its message to the people, the Japanese Communist Party pointed out that Japan's national independence and prosperity are facing a serious crisis. The realization of this platform can not only save the motherland from crisis, but also point out the direction for striving for world peace and the happiness of the Japanese people. The message to the people calls on workers, farmers, intellectuals, youth, women, and small and medium-sized capitalists across the country to unite and fight for the realization of this election platform and the establishment of an independent, peaceful, democratic, and free Japan.

    The Japanese Communist Party's election platform opposes the San Francisco "Peace Treaty," the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement," the U.S.-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," and all war and subordinate treaties; opposes rearmament under the direction of the United States; opposes the revival of militarism; opposes the Manila Treaty military bloc and other military blocs; and declares that the Japanese people will never fight against the Asian people.

    The election platform advocates: achieving peaceful coexistence with all countries; easing international tensions through peaceful consultation; restoring diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union; and realizing exchanges in trade, fishery, transportation, and culture on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
