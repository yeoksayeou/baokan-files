    Prime Minister U Nu's Written Statement Before Departure

    I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude, on behalf of my wife and myself, for the hospitality and kindness shown to us during our visit to your great country. This visit has been most interesting and instructive. I am particularly pleased to have had the opportunity to meet with the leaders of China and to see the various construction projects that the government and the people are carrying out with such great enthusiasm.

    Furthermore, during our entire stay, kind consideration has been showered upon us like rain, making our stay here extremely pleasant. All our needs, wishes, comfort, and convenience have been carefully explored and well taken care of.
