    Promoting soil and water conservation work in the Loess Plateau area of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu provinces to control the soil and water of the Yellow River's middle reaches is an important component of the plan to fundamentally control the Yellow River.

    "Distant mountains are high and forested, nearby mountains are low with flowers and fruit; river plains are cultivated into rice-producing fields, dry gullies are dammed to collect water; slopes and depressions are planted with pasture, gentle mountain slopes become terraced fields. By then, cattle and sheep will form herds, greenery will cover the mountains, and life will be even more beautiful." This is a new folk song recently sung by farmers in northern Shaanxi. In the middle reaches of the Yellow River, farmers in the Loess Plateau area of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu provinces, under the leadership of the People's Government, have successively begun to pilot soil and water conservation work in the Loess Plateau area in recent years. This folk song describes the prospects for the development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in the Loess Plateau area; it fully expresses the enthusiasm and ideals of the farmers in the plateau area for promoting soil and water conservation to transform the natural and economic landscape of the plateau. Soil and water conservation in the Loess Plateau of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu is not only of great significance to the development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in the plateau area and the improvement of the lives of the people in the plateau area, but also a fundamental plan for controlling the Yellow River. As everyone knows, the Yellow River is difficult to control mainly because there is too much sediment in the river. The sediment in the Yellow River mainly comes from the Loess Plateau of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu provinces. If the soil and water of the vast Loess Plateau are not lost, the sediment in the river will be reduced, and the lower reaches of the Yellow River will not be silted up and flooded.

    The Loess Plateau of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu provinces was once a vast wilderness and a historically developed and prosperous place for agriculture. "Yu Gong" said that the soil in this area was fertile loess, and the fields were top-grade fields. Due to severe soil erosion over thousands of years, the plateau has been eroded by floods into ravines, fragmented and unsightly, and the appearance of the wilderness has almost disappeared. Cultivated land has been reduced year by year, and the plateau has become desolate. Soil erosion is due to the natural cause of loose soil structure and easy erosion, but the wars of feudal warlords that devastated the forests in this area in the past centuries are a major reason. During the feudal rule, the people who were extorted and squeezed in order to maintain their lives were forced to cultivate mountain slopes and indiscriminately cut down trees, which further accelerated soil erosion on the plateau. According to a survey by the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, the severity of rainwater erosion on the plateau is alarming. The Donggou in Xifeng Town, Longdong, can be widened by about ten meters a year by floods at the fastest rate. The Lihua Plain (the remaining plain surface of the broken plateau) in Pingliang County is shrinking day by day, and local farmers estimate that the plain surface will be lowered by a plow every three to five years. The famous Dongzhi Plain in Longdong has deep gullies crisscrossing the plain, reaching about 200 meters deep. A large amount of soil is lost every year and flows into the Yellow River, making the Yellow River the river with the highest sediment content in the world. According to records from the Shanzhou Hydrological Station of the Yellow River, the maximum sediment content of river water has reached 46.14 percent; 1.38 billion tons of sediment flow through the Shanzhou Station every year. In this way, the plateau has been eroded by rainwater for thousands of years, and the fertile land has deteriorated day by day; a large amount of sediment flows to the lower reaches of the Yellow River, accumulates along the river, and the riverbed is raised year by year, which makes the lower reaches of the Yellow River form periodic breaches and changes of course.

    In order to control the Yellow River, the People's Government has done a lot of work on soil and water conservation on the plateau. In recent years, the People's Government, based on the principle of "decentralized interception and storage, section-by-section control, combined with drought prevention and resistance, controlling the surface runoff of the original surface, and reducing slope field erosion," has absorbed the experience of the masses of farmers, and according to the different conditions in various places, has led farmers to pilot many soil and water conservation projects in many areas of the plateau, and has achieved results. In the hilly and gully areas of northern Shaanxi Province and western Shanxi Province, farmers build dams to silt up land and coordinate slope management methods to block sediment and conserve water. In the gully areas of the Longdong Plateau, farmers widely build dikes, gully dikes, water cellars, and valley workshops to achieve the purpose of protecting the original and consolidating the gully. In the Longnan and west of the Liupan Mountains, farmers not only build contour dikes, water cellars, and terraced fields according to the terrain, but also improve farming techniques and widely divide the fields into ridges to prevent soil erosion, which is also very effective. In addition, all localities have mobilized farmers to plant trees in every gully and plant grass on every slope, and many places that can no longer be cultivated have closed the mountains for afforestation and returned the land to grazing, in order to gradually green the hills, plateaus, and gullies, and intercept rainwater section by section. These have also initially taken effect in many areas.

    Now, soil erosion has stopped in some areas, and although there is still erosion in some areas, the amount has been greatly reduced, or there is only clear water flowing. These areas have gradually become moist, the grass and trees have become abundant, the fields have become vigorous, and grain production has increased. Niujiapin, Ganggu County, Gansu Province, encountered a heavy rain in August this year that had not been seen for decades. People only saw the continuous rain columns, but did not see the flash floods coming down. The farmers in Kangjiagou nearby said with gratitude: If Niujiapin had not done soil and water conservation work, our beach land would have been finished this year! The wheat within ten meters of the dike of the Li Yongxin mutual aid group in Zhujia Plain, Huan County, Gansu Province, yielded 260 catties per mu this year, while those without dikes only yielded 72 catties per mu. Deng Madou, a 71-year-old farmer in Dengjiabao, Wushan County, Gansu Province, had a "rotten land" that could not be planted with wheat for decades. After building dikes, it yielded two stones of wheat per mu this year, which is four times higher than the general wheat yield in the area. In many places, planting trees and grass solves the difficulties of the lack of feed, fertilizer, and fuel in rural areas in one fell swoop, and promotes the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. In the past, many places suffered from water shortage, but now, due to the construction of reservoirs, people and livestock no longer have to worry about drinking water.

    Soil and water conservation in the Loess Plateau of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu has only just begun. The great significance of this beginning is that people have found a way to control the soil and water in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. In the future, with the unfolding of the project to fundamentally control the Yellow River, and with the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in rural areas, mass soil and water conservation work will be universally launched in the plateau area, and large-scale soil and water conservation projects will be held. The farmers in the plateau area have the confidence and determination to transform their hometowns into prosperous rural areas with green mountains and clear waters, and make their own contributions to controlling the Yellow River.

    把黄河中游地区的水土控制起来
    新华社记者　君谦
    陕西、山西、甘肃三省黄土高原区推行水土保持工作，把黄河中游地区的水土控制起来，是根治黄河计划中的一个重要的组成部分。
    “远山高山森林山，近山低山花果山；川坪修成米粮川，干沟打坝聚湫滩；坡洼地里种牧草，山腰缓坡成梯田。到那时，牛羊成群，绿荫满山，生活更美满。”这是陕北农民最近所唱的一首新的民歌。黄河中游，陕西、山西、甘肃三省黄土高原地区的农民，几年来已在人民政府领导下先后着手试行黄土高原区的水土保持工作。这首民歌描写了黄土高原区农业、林业和畜牧业发展的远景；充分表现了高原区的农民对于推行水土保持以改造高原自然面貌和经济面貌的热情和理想。陕西、山西、甘肃三省黄土高原的水土保持，不只对于高原区的农业、林业、畜牧业的发展，对于高原区人民生活的改善关系重大，而且是治理黄河的根本大计。人们都知道：黄河难治主要是由于河里的泥沙太多。黄河的泥沙主要是从陕西、山西、甘肃三省黄土高原上来的。广大黄土高原上的水土不流失，河水泥沙减少，黄河下游就不至于淤塞、泛滥。
    陕西、山西、甘肃三省黄土高原曾经是广阔的原野，历史上曾经是农业发达、富庶可爱的地方。“禹贡”中就说这一带的土壤是肥美的黄土，田是上等田。由于几千年来严重的水土流失，高原被洪水冲刷成了千沟万壑，破碎不堪，原野的面貌几乎消失。耕地逐年减少，高原荒凉起来了。水土流失除了由于黄土组织疏松、易被冲刷的自然原因外，过去许多世纪中封建军阀的战乱，摧残了这一带的森林是重大的原因。而在封建统治时期，被勒索榨取的人民为了维持生活被迫垦殖山坡，滥伐林木的结果，更加速了高原上的水土流失。据黄河水利委员会调查，高原上雨水冲刷的严重程度是很惊人的。陇东西峰镇的东沟，最快时一年可以被洪水冲宽十公尺左右。平凉县的梨花原（破碎高原的残余原面）日渐缩小，而且据当地老农估计每三、五年原面就要被冲低一犁。陇东著名的董志原，原上纵横密布的深沟深达二百公尺左右。年年泥土大量流失，流入黄河，因而黄河成了世界上含沙量最大的河流。据黄河陕州水文站记载：河水含沙量最大时到过百分之四十六点一四；每年从陕州站流过的泥沙达十三亿八千万吨。这样，几千年来高原被雨水冲刷，肥沃的土地日益变坏；大量的泥沙流到黄河下游，沿河淤积，河床年年抬高，又使黄河下游形成周期性地决口改道。
    为了治理黄河，人民政府对高原的水土保持已做了许多工作。几年来，人民政府根据“分散拦蓄，节节控制，结合防旱抗旱，控制原面迳流，减缓坡田冲刷”的方针，吸收农民群众的经验，根据各地不同条件，在高原区许多地区领导农民试办了许多水土保持工程，并且已经获得了成效。陕西省北部和山西省西部的丘陵沟壑区，农民打坝淤地，配合坡地治理的办法，拦住了泥沙也保住了水。陇东高原沟壑区，农民广修地埂、沟埂、涝池、谷坊等工程，也达到了保原固沟的目的。陇南和六盘山以西地区，农民除随地势修等高埂、水窖、梯田等以外，并改进耕作技术，在田间广泛分区作垅以防水土流失，也很有成效。此外，各地并发动农民沟沟植树，坡坡种草，许多不能再耕种下去的地方便封山育林，还山还牧，以求逐渐绿化丘陵、高原和沟壑，把雨水节节拦蓄起来。这些，在许多地区也已初步见效。
    现在，有的地区水土已经停止流失，有的虽有流失，但数量大减，或者只有清水细流。这些地区已渐渐变得土地湿润，草木渐丰，田禾旺盛，谷物增产。甘肃省甘谷县牛家坪今年八月遇到几十年没有见过的大雨，人们只看到扯不断的雨柱，却没有见暴洪下来。附近康家沟的农民感激不尽地说：要不是牛家坪作了水土保持工作，今年我们的滩地也完蛋啦！甘肃省环县朱家原李永信互助组的地，接近地埂十公尺以内的小麦，今年每亩收二百六十斤，没有修地埂的，每亩只收七十二斤。甘肃武山县邓家堡七十一岁的农民邓麻豆有块“烂地”，几十年不能种小麦了，修了地埂后，今年每亩竟收小麦两石，比当地一般小麦产量高出四倍。许多地方植树种草一举而解决了农村饲料、肥料、燃料三缺的困难，推动了农业和畜牧业的发展。过去许多苦于缺水的地方，现在也因修了蓄水池，人和牲畜的饮水已不用再耽心了。
    陕西、山西、甘肃黄土高原区的水土保持工作还只是刚刚开始。这个开始的重大意义是人们已经找到了把黄河中游地区的水土控制起来的办法。今后随着根治黄河的工程的展开，随着农村中互助合作组织的发展，高原区将普遍展开群众性的水土保持工作，举办大规模的水土保持工程。高原区的农民有信心和决心把自己的家乡改造成山青水绿的富庶的农村，并对治理黄河作出自己的贡献。
