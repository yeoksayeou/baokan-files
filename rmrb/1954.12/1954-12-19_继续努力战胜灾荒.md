Editorial: Continue Efforts to Overcome the Famine

This year, our country encountered floods unprecedented in a century. People in the flood-stricken areas, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, actively engaged in flood prevention and rescue, waged a tenacious struggle against the floods, defended the safety of cities such as Wuhan, and achieved an unprecedented victory in flood control, demonstrating the superiority of our country's people's democratic system. This great victory brings us the courage to forge ahead and the confidence to completely overcome the disaster.

Overcoming the floods is only the first step in overcoming the famine. Many flood-stricken areas, especially the severely affected areas, still need to overcome many difficulties in people's lives and production after the flood. Therefore, one of the major tasks this winter is to speed up the project of closing breaches and restoring embankments, properly resettle the disaster victims, help them get through the severe winter, organize them to engage in various productions, prevent the occurrence of spring famine next year, and lay a solid foundation for a bumper harvest next year and completely overcome the disaster.

At present, most of the disaster victims who were evacuated from the Yangtze River and Huai River coastal areas and the Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake lakeside areas during the flood season this year have been returned to their hometowns by the government. In Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, over 95 percent of the relocated victims have returned home. After the disaster victims returned home, the government used its greatest efforts to help them rebuild their homes and solve their difficulties in life and production. Anhui Province alone has distributed over 80 billion yuan in housing subsidies to disaster victims, and over 610,000 houses have been built by disaster victims in the Fuyang, Lu'an, and Su counties and Bengbu city. Hubei Province has issued over 500 billion yuan in relief funds and production loans to disaster victims, and another 500 billion yuan is being distributed. In order to help disaster victims get through the severe winter, various places have prepared a large number of winter clothes. Hubei Province has transported over 1.1 million cotton-padded clothes donated by urban residents and manufactured by the government to the disaster areas. People's governments at all levels have also sent many inspection teams to the disaster areas to inspect work, and many urban residents have organized condolence groups to visit the disaster areas, understand the needs of the disaster victims, and prepare for the winter. These all demonstrate the country's infinite concern for the disaster victims, enabling the disaster victims to actively participate in various production and self-rescue work with full confidence.

However, some cadres in some disaster areas have developed complacency and relaxation after the victory in flood control. They do not understand that the people who have just overcome the floods are like patients who have just undergone surgery, and they need continued medical treatment and care in order to completely overcome the disease; any negligence in this regard will aggravate the suffering of the disaster victims and cause losses to the country. Because this complacency and relaxation has not been corrected in time, some cadres in some disaster areas have adopted an intolerable bureaucratic attitude towards disaster relief work. The leading organs in these areas also verbally called for disaster relief, but were actually busy with other work. The state has allocated huge amounts of relief funds and loans to support the disaster victims in overcoming the disaster, but some cadres, when publicizing the disaster relief policies, were unwilling to explain the state's relief measures to the masses, or subjectively formulated very cumbersome distribution procedures, or even no one went to distribute them, resulting in a large backlog of relief grain and funds at various levels. Taking the Eighth District of Jianli County, Hubei Province as an example, this district still had 80 million yuan of relief funds from September in late November, which greatly hindered the disaster victims from carrying out production. If this bureaucratic style is not corrected immediately, disaster relief work in these areas cannot be carried out smoothly. Now that the severe winter has arrived, and the disaster victims have entered the most difficult time to overcome the famine, the people's governments at all levels in the disaster-stricken areas must organize a large number of people to go deep into the severely affected areas to conduct a special inspection of the work of resettling the disaster victims. Most of the relief funds and loans should also be issued at this time in order to solve the problems of food, clothing, and housing for the disaster victims in a timely manner. During the distribution, the general method should be to combine leadership control with mass evaluation, and truly achieve appropriate, fair, and reasonable distribution, and oppose the undemocratic style of being handled by a few cadres.

On the basis of doing a good job in resettlement, we should pay attention to organizing and leading the disaster victims to carry out various productions, and we must enable the disaster victims to carry out production and self-rescue with the help of relief funds and production loans. Actively organizing and leading the disaster victims to participate in production is the only correct way to relieve the difficulties in the lives of the disaster victims and overcome the severe winter; only by actively organizing and leading the disaster victims to participate in production can we effectively prevent the occurrence of spring famine next year and create favorable conditions for a bumper harvest next year. Therefore, when distributing relief funds or production loans, the disaster area workers must repeatedly explain the principles of production and disaster relief to the disaster victims, educate the masses to be careful in their calculations, and start to organize and lead the disaster victims to carry out production, so that the use of every relief fund can truly help the disaster victims solve their difficulties in life and production, and can truly promote the restoration and development of production in the disaster area. At present, the party and government leading organs in the disaster-stricken areas generally pay attention to the leadership of agricultural and sideline production of the disaster victims, and have achieved great results. For example, some disaster areas in Anhui Province have completed 70 percent of the winter planting task. After the disaster victims in Renhe Township, Hanchuan County, Hubei Province solved their living difficulties, they used state relief funds and loans to repair nearly a hundred large and small farm tools, bought back more than 30,000 kilograms of seeds, and, with agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups as the main force, formulated a plan to increase production by 130,000 kilograms of grain next spring. The sideline production in the disaster areas is also being carried out more widely under the principle of not affecting agricultural production. In the disaster areas of Hebei Province, more than 3 million farmers have participated in sideline production. While carrying out agricultural production, the disaster victims in Wangpo Township, Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, have drawn some people to engage in sideline production such as weaving mats, fishing, and making mud work. From September 20 to October 29, they have earned more than 30 million yuan. These are all good examples. In the disaster-stricken areas, wherever it is possible to organize and lead the disaster victims to carry out agricultural and sideline production, especially to pay attention to organizing the disaster victims to participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, the living difficulties of the disaster victims are generally solved, and production is gradually restored or even developed.

However, not all disaster areas have fully paid attention to organizing the disaster victims to carry out production, and some cadres in some disaster areas regard the state's relief and loans to the disaster victims as a simple "alms," and relax or even abandon the leadership of the disaster victims' production. In Berlin Township, Hanyang County, Hubei Province, because production was not organized in time after the relief funds were distributed, some disaster victims who could carry the embankment did not carry it; some open spaces that could be planted with vegetables were not planted; many people sat in teahouses drinking tea every day, without engaging in production, simply waiting for state relief. This phenomenon must be corrected immediately. There is also a phenomenon of mechanically emphasizing production and self-rescue, which is also a manifestation of ignoring the specific difficulties of the disaster victims. Although organizing the disaster victims to return to their hometowns, rebuild their homes, carry out various productions, and carry out production and self-rescue with the help of state relief and all parties is the basic policy for overcoming the disaster; but in some areas with particularly severe disasters, it is difficult for the disaster victims to solve their difficulties for a while after returning to their hometowns, and they cannot carry out production immediately. For these areas, a portion of the old and weak disaster victims should be planned to continue to live in non-disaster areas, and some of the old and weak disaster victims who have returned to their hometowns can also be transferred to non-disaster areas to live temporarily, so that they can spend the severe winter season with the help of the people and governments in non-disaster areas, and then gradually return after the houses and production in the disaster areas are largely restored.

Overcoming the floods is the result of full mobilization and cooperation from all sides, and is the result of national support. At present, in order to achieve victory in disaster relief on the basis of the victory in flood control, we must continue to strive for strong support from the whole country and close cooperation from various relevant economic departments. In the areas where disasters have formed, the strength itself is very weak, and many of the living materials and production materials needed by the disaster victims depend on the supply and support from other places; many sideline products produced by the disaster victims also need to be transported to other places for sale. This requires the grain department to allocate grain to the disaster areas in a timely manner to prevent shortages; requires the forestry department to supply the disaster victims with timber for building houses; requires the trade and cooperation departments to supply various production materials and daily necessities according to the needs of the disaster areas, and to purchase the local specialties of the disaster areas in a timely manner. The supply of materials to the disaster areas must have good transportation conditions, and the transportation department should assume this arduous task. The health department must also do everything possible to prevent and curb the spread of diseases. Supporting the disaster areas and supporting the disaster victims in overcoming the difficulties brought about by the disaster is the glorious responsibility of these departments. Because many departments have fulfilled their responsibilities, they have effectively ensured the supply of materials in the disaster areas. The Yangtze River Navigation Administration and the Nanjing Railway Transportation Bureau have allocated special ships and trains to prioritize the transportation of seeds to support the disaster areas. Due to the timely transfer of large quantities of grain by the grain department and transportation department of Hubei Province, the general grain reserves in the disaster-stricken areas can guarantee the supply. Jingzhou Prefecture has also organized 2,000 wooden boats to transport grain. The relevant departments in the main transfer stations and transfer areas have also formed joint offices, simplified transfer procedures, and reduced the obstacles to vehicles and ships in transit. Many supply and marketing departments in the disaster-stricken areas have vigorously supplied the disaster victims with materials needed for construction and purchased products from the disaster areas. Each district in Huangmei County, Hubei Province has established medical stations and mobile medical teams to provide free treatment to the disaster victims. The strong support of the relevant departments has provided a reliable material guarantee for the people in the disaster areas to overcome the disaster.

However, recently some individual units in some departments have not recognized their responsibilities in disaster relief work, and they have shown a passive and perfunctory attitude and made excuses for shirking their responsibilities for disaster relief work. For example, some transportation departments in Anhui Province emphasized the order of "freight transportation" and left the fresh fish produced by the disaster victims aside, resulting in the fresh fish rotting and deteriorating. The small boat from Hexian County to Wuhu City only allows 15 pieces of fresh fish to be loaded per day, and the fish from the disaster area is not loaded even if there is space in the cabin. The Wuhu City Shelter houses many disaster-stricken infants, but there is only one pediatrician in the shelter. The shelter repeatedly requested the health department to transfer a doctor, but it has not been resolved for a long time. This phenomenon of not caring enough about the disaster-stricken compatriots and lacking compassion is intolerable.

In order to do a good job in disaster relief work, in addition to the civil affairs department doing a good job in resettlement and relief for the disaster victims, all agencies such as grain, commerce, cooperation, transportation, health, forestry, and banks should make detailed plans in advance, assign cadres to be specifically responsible, and regularly inspect and supervise the work of supporting the disaster areas. Trade and cooperation departments should actively operate on the principle of no loss and no profit or less loss and no profit in the supply of materials to the disaster areas and the purchase of sideline products from the disaster victims. We must resolutely oppose bureaucracy, oppose the phenomenon of departmentalism that only cares about the interests of one's own unit, ignores the overall interests, emphasizes difficulties, and passively treats the work of supporting the disaster areas. If any department causes bad results due to delaying support for the disaster areas, it is a serious mistake and dereliction of duty.

Since we have the strength to overcome the floods unprecedented in a century, we will certainly be able to overcome the disasters left by the floods. We have the strong leadership of the Party and the People's Government, we have huge relief funds and loans as a material guarantee, we have the support of the people in the vast non-disaster areas, and we have the rich experience of disaster relief work over the years. As long as we further mobilize, work together with one heart, we will be able to completely overcome the disaster caused by this year's floods.

### 继续努力战胜灾荒

    继续努力战胜灾荒
    今年我们国家遭遇了百年未有的洪水。遭水地区人民在党和人民政府领导下，积极防汛抢险，向洪水进行顽强斗争，保卫了武汉等城市的安全，取得了史无前例的防汛大胜利，显示了我国人民民主制度的优越性。这种巨大的胜利带给我们以奋勇前进的勇气和完全战胜灾荒的信心。
    战胜洪水只是战胜灾荒的第一步。许多遭水地区特别是重灾区，大水过后，人民在生活上和生产上的许多困难都需要继续克服。因此今冬的重大任务之一，就是要加紧堵口复堤工程，妥善地安置灾民，帮助灾民渡过严冬，组织灾民进行各种生产，防止明年春荒发生，并为明年丰收、完全战胜灾荒打下坚实的基础。
    目前，长江和淮河的沿岸地区以及洞庭湖和鄱阳湖的湖滨地区在今年防汛期间转移到外地的灾民，已经大部分由政府领导还乡。湖北、湖南、江西三省还乡灾民已达百分之九十五以上。灾民还乡以后，政府用最大力量来帮助他们重整家园，帮助他们解决生活和生产上的困难。安徽省仅发放给灾民的修房补助费即有八百多亿元，阜阳、六安、宿县三个专区和蚌埠市的灾民已盖好住房六十一万多间。湖北省发给灾民的救济款和生产贷款等已达五千多亿元，还有五千多亿元正在发放中。为帮助灾民渡过严冬，各地都准备了大批冬衣。湖北省已把城市人民捐献的和政府制造的一百一十多万件棉衣运送灾区。各级人民政府并派了不少检查组到灾区检查工作，许多城市人民更组织慰问团到灾区慰问灾民，了解灾民的需求和过冬准备情况。这些都表现了国家对灾民的无限关怀，使灾民信心百倍地积极投入各项生产自救的工作。
    但是也有一部分灾区的干部，在防汛胜利以后产生了自满松劲情绪。他们不了解刚刚战胜洪水的人民如同刚刚动过手术的病人一样，需要继续医治和护理，才能完全战胜病魔；在这方面的任何疏忽大意，都会加重灾民的痛苦，给国家造成损失。由于这种自满松劲情绪没有受到及时的纠正，有的灾区的干部对救灾工作采取了不能容忍的官僚主义态度。这些地区的领导机关口头上也喊救灾，但实际忙于其他工作。国家为支援灾民战胜灾荒拨出巨额的救济款和贷款，但是有些干部在宣传救灾政策时，却不愿向群众说明国家的救济办法，或是主观地制订了十分繁琐的发放手续，甚至没有人去发放，因而造成大批救济粮款的层层积压。以湖北省监利县第八区为例，这个区到十一月下旬还积压着九月份的救济款八千万元，大大妨害灾民进行生产。这种官僚主义作风如果不立即纠正，这些地区的救灾工作就不能顺利开展。现在严冬已到，灾民渡荒已进入最困难的时候，受灾地区的各级人民政府必须组织大批力量，深入重灾区对安置灾民的工作作一次专门检查。救济款和贷款也应大部分趁此时发下，以便及时解决灾民的衣食住问题。发放时，一般应采取领导掌握和群众评议相结合的办法，真正作到发放适当、公平合理，反对由少数干部包办的不民主作风。
    在做好安置工作的基础上，应该注意组织和领导灾民进行各项生产，必须使灾民能够在救济款和生产贷款的帮助下进行生产自救。积极组织和领导灾民参加生产，是解除灾民生活困难，渡过严冬的唯一正确的道路；也只有积极组织和领导灾民参加生产，才能够有效地防止明年春荒的发生，并为明年的农业丰收创造有利条件。因此，灾区工作人员在发放救济款或生产贷款时，必须向灾民反复说明生产救灾的道理，向群众进行精打细算的教育，并着手组织和领导灾民进行生产，使每一笔救灾款项的使用，都确实能帮助灾民解决生活和生产困难，确实能推动灾区生产的恢复和发展。目前受灾地区的党政领导机关，一般都注意对灾民农业生产和副业生产的领导，并已取得很大的成效。如安徽省某些灾区冬种任务已完成百分之七十。湖北省汉川县人和乡灾民解决了生活困难以后，用国家救济款和贷款修好大小农具近百件，买回种籽三万多斤、在七天内种田五千多亩，并以农业生产合作社和互助组为主，订出明春增产十三万斤粮食的计划。灾区的副业生产也在不影响农业生产的原则下比较普遍地开展起来了。河北省灾区参加副业生产的农民已达三百多万人。河南省项城王坡乡灾民在进行农业生产同时，抽出一部分人从事编席、打鱼、做泥工等副业生产，从九月二十日到十月二十九日，已赚钱三千多万元。这些都是较好的例子。在受灾地区，凡是能够组织和领导灾民进行农业和副业生产，特别是注意组织灾民参加互助合作组织的地方，灾民的生活困难就大体得到解决，生产逐渐恢复甚至有了发展。
    然而并不是所有灾区都已充分注意到组织灾民进行生产，有的灾区的干部把国家对灾民的救济和贷款看作一种单纯的“施舍”，而放松甚至放弃了对灾民生产的领导。湖北省汉阳县柏林乡就因为在发放救济款以后没有及时组织生产，灾民中有可以挑堤的，也不挑了；有的空地可以种菜的，也不种了；许多人每天坐在茶馆吃茶，不事生产，单纯等待国家救济。这种现象必须立即纠正。还有一种机械强调生产自救的现象，也是忽视灾民具体困难的表现。虽然，组织灾民还乡，恢复家园，进行各项生产，在国家救济和各方面帮助下，进行生产自救，这是战胜灾荒的基本方针；但也有些灾情特重地区，灾民回乡后一时很难解决困难，无法立即进行生产。对于这一类地方，应有计划地留一部分老弱灾民继续在非灾区居住，已回乡的也可以再转移一部分老弱灾民到非灾区暂住，以便在非灾区人民和政府的帮助下，渡过严冬季节，等到灾区房屋和生产大体恢复后再陆续回去。
    战胜洪水是各方面全面动员通力合作的结果，是全国支援的结果。目前要在防汛胜利的基础上取得救灾的胜利，也必须继续争取全国的有力支援和各个有关经济部门的密切配合。在灾荒形成的地区，本身力量非常薄弱，灾民所需要的生活资料和生产资料，很多都要依赖外地的供应和支援；灾民生产的许多副业产品，也多需要运到外地推销。这就要求粮食部门及时向灾区调拨粮食，防止脱销；要求林业部门供应灾民以建筑住房的木材；要求贸易合作部门按照灾区的需要供应各种生产资料和日常用品，及时收购灾区的土特产品。供应灾区物资必须具有良好的运输条件，交通部门应该担负起这一繁重的任务。卫生部门也必须尽一切力量预防并遏止疾病的蔓延。支援灾区，支援灾民战胜灾荒带来的困难，是这些部门的义不容辞的光荣职责。由于许多部门都履行了自己的职责，因而有效地保证了灾区的物资供应。长江航运管理局、南京铁路运输分局为优先运送种籽支援灾区，曾拨出专轮、专车。湖北省粮食部门和交通部门由于及时调运大批粮食，受灾地区一般库存粮都能保证供应。荆州专区并已组织两千只木船接运粮食。主要运转站和交接地区的有关部门并已组成联合办公室，简化了交接手续，减少了车辆和船只在运转中的阻碍。许多受灾地区的供销部门曾大力供应灾民建筑需用器材和收购灾区产品。湖北省黄梅县每个区都建立了医疗站和巡回医疗队，为灾民免费治疗。有关部门的有力支援，给灾区人民战胜灾荒提供了可靠的物质保障。
    但是，近来有些部门中的个别单位还没有认清自己在救灾工作中的责任，他们对救灾工作表现了消极应付和借故推辞的态度。例如安徽省某些运输部门强调“货运”的先后次序，而把灾民生产的鲜鱼搁在一边，结果使鲜鱼腐烂变质。和县到芜湖的小轮每日限装十五件鲜鱼，船舱有空位也不装运灾区的鱼。芜湖市收容所收养不少受灾婴儿，而所内只有一位儿科医生。收容所再三向卫生部门请求调派医生一名，但迟迟不予解决。这种对受灾同胞不够关心和缺乏同情心的现象是不能容忍的。
    为了作好救灾工作，除民政部门要作好对灾民的安置和救济以外，无论粮食、商业、合作、运输、卫生、林业以及银行等机关，都应事先作出周详的计划，抽调干部专门负责，并经常对支援灾区的工作进行检查督促。贸易合作等部门对灾区的物资供应和对灾民副业产品的收购，应本不赔不赚或少赔不赚的原则，积极经营。我们必须坚决反对官僚主义，反对那种只顾本单位利益，不顾整体利益，强调困难，消极对待支援灾区工作的本位主义现象。任何部门如果因为延误对灾区的支援而造成恶果，都是严重的错误和失职行为。
    我们既然有力量战胜百年未有的洪水，也就一定能够战胜洪水留下来的灾害。我们有着党和人民政府的坚强领导，有着巨额的救济款和贷款作为物质保证，有着广大非灾区人民的支援，有着历年来救灾工作的丰富经验，只要我们进一步动员起来，同心协力，就完全能够战胜由于今年的洪水所造成的灾荒。
