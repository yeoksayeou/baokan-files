    Yichun Forestry Area Begins Using Tractors for Timber Skidding
    The Yichun Forestry Area, adopting the suggestions of Soviet experts, has successfully trialed the use of Stalin-80 tractors for timber skidding. This winter, over sixty tractors will be deployed in the mountains for timber skidding operations. In recent years, the timber skidding work in the Yichun Forestry Area has primarily relied on Kett-12 tractors, and the difficulty of insufficient mechanical power has long remained unresolved. This year, following the suggestion of Soviet expert Babushkin to utilize Stalin-80 tractors for timber skidding, the administrative bureau dispatched technical personnel to study under expert Babushkin while actively preparing personnel, tools, and other necessities. Trials began on October 25th at the Ninth Logging Yard of the Cuiluan Forestry Industrial Bureau. The trial results demonstrated that the Stalin-80 tractor can skid over ten cubic meters of timber per trip, approximately twice the efficiency of the Kett-12 tractor. Thus, the Stalin-80 tractor not only demonstrates its effectiveness in timber transportation but also fully leverages its mechanical efficiency in timber skidding operations. Currently, the Wudaoku, Wuminhe, and other Forestry Industrial Bureaus have sent personnel to the Ninth Logging Yard of the Cuiluan Bureau for practical training. (Dai Yue)

    伊春林区开始用拖拉机集材
    伊春林区采纳苏联专家建议，试用斯大林八十号拖拉机集材成功，今冬将有六十余台拖拉机入山进行集材作业。伊春林区几年来的集材工作，主要是依靠克特一二拖拉机，机械力量不足的困难长期没有获得解决。今年，苏联专家巴布士金提出的利用斯大林八十号拖拉机集材的建议后，该管理局一面专门派技术人员向巴布士金专家学习，一面积极进行了人员工具等一系列的准备工作，十月二十五日在翠峦森林工业局第九伐木场开始进行试验。试验结果证明：斯大林八十号拖拉机每次能集材十立方公尺以上，比克特一二拖拉机集材效率约高两倍。这样斯大林八十号拖拉机不但在运材中发挥效能，而且在集材作业上仍能充分发挥其机械效能。目前五道库、乌敏河等森林工业局已派人前往翠峦局第九伐木场进行实习。　（戴月）
