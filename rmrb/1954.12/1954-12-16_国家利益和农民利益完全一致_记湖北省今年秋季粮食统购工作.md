The Interests of the State and the Interests of the Peasants are Completely Consistent
    ——A Record of Hubei Province's Autumn Grain Unified Purchase Work This Year
    By our reporter Gu Weijin
    Since October, 10,273 villages in Hubei Province have been conducting unified grain purchase work in two batches. Up to now, the province has completed more than 70% of the unified grain purchase task.
    This year's unified grain purchase work in Hubei Province has focused on two key aspects: one is to do thorough ideological mobilization work, and the other is to conscientiously implement the policy of unified purchase of surplus grain.
    Over the past year, the implementation of unified grain purchase and sales in the vast rural areas of Hubei Province has brought many benefits to farmers: guaranteeing supply, stabilizing prices, promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture, etc. However, due to the failure to effectively coordinate political work and economic work, and the existence of certain shortcomings in the unified purchase and sales work, many rural work cadres and farmers do not have sufficient understanding of these benefits. When work began in various places, the first issues encountered at county, district, and township cadre meetings, or mass meetings, were the following: Some township cadres and activists asked: "Last year, taking the lead in selling grain was a loss: the masses were dissatisfied, and the family was angry. I won't do this silly thing this year." Some farmers said: "The scope of unified sales is getting wider and wider, and the road to industrialization is too bitter"; "Let's build a few less of the 141 projects"...
    To solve these ideological problems among cadres and farmers, it is necessary to continue education on the general line. But what should be taught? In some places, abstractly promoting "supporting industrialization, supporting the liberation of Taiwan, and supporting disaster areas" to farmers first led to farmers' dissatisfaction, saying: "It's too broad and too far." After criticizing this practice, various places started from the actual ideological problems of cadres and farmers, encouraging them to summarize the benefits of unified grain purchase and sales over the past year; from the comparison of the new and old markets, and the comparison of the new and old roads, they gradually clarified that unified grain purchase and sales are beneficial to farmers.
    Township cadres in the Chengxi District of Jiangling County compared grain prices and supplies during the two famine years, saying: "During a famine before liberation, one dan of grain sold for 120,000 yuan in the morning and rose to 280,000 yuan in the evening. Even then, it was not easy to buy; this year is also a disaster year (flood), but this year's grain prices have not risen: last year, one jin of rice sold for more than 800 yuan, and this year one jin of rice still sells for more than 800 yuan, and everyone can buy it. If it weren't for unified purchase and sales, where would this good thing come from?"
    Farmers in Hedong Township, Xishui County, compared the situation of mutual aid and cooperation before and after unified purchase and sales, saying: "We originally had thirty-two mutual aid teams. Before the unified grain purchase, many people were enthusiastic about grain speculation, and the mutual aid teams almost collapsed. After unified grain purchase and sales, spontaneous forces decreased, and the mutual aid teams developed to seventy-nine, and three agricultural production cooperatives were also established. This year, the teams and cooperatives have had good harvests." So they unanimously recognized: "Unified purchase and sales are necessary."
    While summarizing the benefits of unified purchase and sales, township cadres and activists in various places analyzed the so-called "mass dissatisfaction" during last year's unified purchase and sales, asking who was dissatisfied and why. From the situations presented by everyone, it was generally: 1. Rich peasants and those engaged in grain speculation were dissatisfied with unified purchase and sales; 2. "Well-to-do households" (middle peasants with better economic conditions) felt that unified purchase and sales were not free, and were dissatisfied; 3. In some places, unified purchase was carried out too tightly, and supply did not keep up in time, causing mass dissatisfaction. After discussion, everyone correctly understood these dissatisfactions: the dissatisfaction of the first type of people should not be listened to, the dissatisfaction of the second type of people should be educated and persuaded, and the dissatisfaction of the third type of people was caused by certain shortcomings in the work, which can be corrected. Finally, everyone unanimously felt that it is necessary to distinguish the dissatisfaction of rich peasants and those engaged in grain speculation with unified purchase and sales, the dissatisfaction of the masses caused by shortcomings in the work of cadres, and the unified purchase and sales policy.
    Understanding the benefits of unified grain purchase and sales does not mean that there are no more ideological problems among rural work cadres and farmers. Some people say: "Unified purchase and sales are good, but why can't some things be bought? Where is it being unified to?" To solve this problem, various places first encouraged farmers to calculate production accounts and living accounts, so that farmers could understand the principles of supply and demand contradictions. For example, cadres in Shihe Township, Xishui County, encouraged poor peasant Yi Yisong to calculate an account: In 1952, Yi Yisong's grain production increased by more than 30% compared to 1948, but the grain he consumed in 1952 increased by more than 80% compared to 1948. In addition, in 1952, the meat, oil, and cloth he consumed also increased by 50% or more compared to 1948, while his production of oilseeds, cotton, and pork increased, but far less than his own needs. After this calculation, Yi Yisong said: "The reason why things are not easy to buy is not because of other reasons, but because production is running slowly and life is running fast." After farmers understood the principle of supply and demand contradictions, cadres in various places guided farmers to understand the way to solve supply and demand contradictions: this is to develop production according to the state's plan and obey the material distribution plan. To develop production, it is necessary to accelerate national industrialization. Implementing unified grain purchase and sales to support industrial production with sufficient grain is to accelerate national industrialization.
           ×          ×         ×
    On the basis of farmers' understanding of the benefits of unified grain purchase and sales, various places began the work of purchasing surplus grain.
    In order to do this work well, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party emphasized that it is necessary to purchase as much surplus grain as possible under the requirement of resolutely implementing the policy of purchasing surplus grain. However, some cadres did not fully accept this spirit, so the work encountered some resistance at the beginning.
    Cadres fully supported "purchasing as much surplus grain as possible," as some people said: "Last year, there was only one major support (supporting industrialization), but this year there are three major supports (supporting industrialization, supporting the liberation of Taiwan, and supporting disaster areas). If we don't purchase more surplus grain, we won't be able to support them." However, in actual work, some cadres felt that the task was large. In order to complete the task, they turned "purchasing as much surplus grain as possible" into "purchasing as much as possible." As a result, some areas saw the following situation: In order to complete the task, the policy was not well implemented.
    It should be pointed out that after the first step of education – summarizing the benefits of unified grain purchase and sales over the past year – the socialist consciousness of farmers has been raised, but some farmers still have such concerns about selling surplus grain: Some unreasonable phenomena occurred in last year's unified grain purchase (such as those who should have sold surplus grain did not sell it thoroughly, and some who should not have sold it sold too much); unified sales were also not well combined with unified purchase, resulting in some unreasonable supplies. They worry that selling surplus grain this year will be like last year. Therefore, it is necessary to further implement the state's grain unified purchase policy – the "four retentions" policy, that is, retaining food grain, seeds, feed, and a portion of mobile grain, so that farmers understand what selling surplus grain is all about this year, in order to eliminate concerns.
    However, some cadres dared not explain the "four retentions" policy to farmers. They were afraid that after farmers understood the "four retentions" policy, they would want to retain more grain, affecting the completion of the task. As the cadres of Gaojia Township in Hongshan County said: "If we publicize all the 'four retentions' policies, the masses will say that it is not enough to eat, so how can we complete the task?" They had an idea in their minds: "You first sell the grain, let me complete the task, and then give you the 'four retentions'." Therefore, their work deployment first focused on mobilizing farmers to report actual yields, and only provided general publicity for the "four retentions" policy. Farmers were concerned – which is actually very natural. "Four retentions" are related to the lives and production of every farmer throughout the year, and every farmer is very concerned about it. However, the cadres only gave general publicity, and the farmers could not figure out what was going on. How could they not worry?
    Farmers in Xiangyang, Huanggang, and other counties said well: "How exactly should the 'four retentions' be retained? How much should be retained? Will there be enough food grain retained? Or will the food grain be bought away?" Before these issues were resolved, farmers were generally unwilling to report actual yields. Chen Shiyuan, a representative of Fengshan Township in Hong'an County, actually harvested seven dan and two dou of grain, but he only reported six dan and seven dou. Gao Zaichao, a farmer in Chenzhuang Township, Zaoyang County, actually harvested sixteen dan of grain, but he only reported thirteen dan. Because farmers were unwilling to report actual yields, some cadres felt that the task was difficult to complete, so they adopted the method of subordinating policy to the task, lowering the "four retentions" standard (changing to "two retentions," "three retentions," etc.), or unreasonably increasing yields, disguisedly reducing the amount of "four retentions." As a result, farmers were even more concerned and even more unwilling to report actual yields. Xu Zhongqing, a farmer in Gongxin Township, Yidu County, had a yield of 630 jin per unit area, but he only reported 380 jin. In Xingshan County, some townships concealed yields that were half or two-thirds of the actual yield. Generally, farmers said: "If you retain enough, I will report accurately; if you want to deduct from the pot (that is, deduct food grain), I will retain it in the field (that is, conceal production)." In many areas, work was not easy to carry out.
    After discovering this situation, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly instructed party committees at all levels, explaining that the state's grain unified purchase policy is the policy of unified purchase of farmers' surplus grain. "Purchasing as much surplus grain as possible" must be carried out under the implementation of the "four retentions" policy. It is necessary to boldly explain the "four retentions" policy to farmers, and farmers will consciously implement the policy. According to this instruction, party committees at all levels convened emergency meetings to reverse the idea that cadres dared not explain the "four retentions" policy to farmers and lower the "four retentions" standards. And redeploy work, first explaining the "four retentions" policy clearly to farmers: At the township people's congress, democratically discuss a general standard for the "four retentions," and then implement it according to the specific situation of each farmer based on this standard. In this way, farmers' concerns were eliminated, they voluntarily reported actual yields, and enthusiastically sold surplus grain. Zhang Juqian, a township government member of Houying Township in Gucheng County, was originally afraid that reporting actual yields would not leave enough food grain, so he concealed one dan of yield. Now, after listening to the cadres explain the "four retentions" policy clearly, he said: "I won't conceal any more production. I will add that one dan of surplus grain that I retained." The original task of purchasing surplus grain assigned to Baohua Township in Xingshan County was 90,000 jin. Farmers did not report actual yields, and it was calculated that there were only 60,000 jin of surplus grain. After the cadres explained the "four retentions" policy, the farmers all said: "If we had done this earlier, we would have reported accurately long ago." Immediately, a "supplementary reporting" movement (that is, reporting all the yields that were previously concealed) was launched throughout the township. As a result, in addition to completing the originally assigned task of 90,000 jin, the township also purchased an additional 100,000 jin of surplus grain.
    Of course, when explaining the "four retentions" policy, a series of ideological mobilization work was also carried out. This work included: On the one hand, vigorously publicizing the "four retentions" policy, and on the other hand, raising the awareness of advanced elements, and implementing liaison mobilization. Gangzi Township in Yun County is a good example. At the beginning, the work cadres vigorously publicized the "four retentions" policy, clearly proposing "retain first, sell later," "retain enough, then sell," "retain enough to eat, and sell the remaining." At the same time, the work cadres first educated Han Shiqin, the director of the township representatives, on selling surplus grain, raising his socialist consciousness, and then Han Shiqin gave a report on selling surplus grain at a meeting of key members of the township (mainly poor peasants and new middle peasants). He calculated his own account with everyone: producing 2,411 jin of grain, after deducting 2,030 jin for the "four retentions," there were still 381 jin left. Then he said: "The government's 'four retentions' policy not only takes care of my life, but also takes care of my production. I will sell all 381 jin of surplus grain." His exemplary behavior influenced all the key members to report actual yields. Among them, party member Wang Yuanhua reported actual yields at the meeting and wanted to sell 1,100 jin of surplus grain, but he was afraid that his family members would not understand, so he was concerned. Qian Zhengxin, the party branch secretary, discovered this situation and helped him to get through the thoughts of his wife. After the twenty-seven key members reported actual yields, everyone said with high morale: "In this way, it will be easy for us to mobilize the masses, and we won't have to 'eat fried noodles in a big wind' and find it hard to speak." They then went to liaise and mobilize in the mutual aid teams separately. Key member Long Yongxing used his own example of "how much to produce, how much to retain, how much to sell" to mobilize Xie Congshan, the leader of the poor peasant mutual aid team, to sell surplus grain, and Xie Congshan led the fifteen households in the entire team to sell surplus grain. After the whole township mobilized nineteen mutual aid teams to sell surplus grain through the liaison and mobilization of these key members, a campaign to sell surplus grain was launched throughout the township. In Dayan Township, Zhijiang County, the "four retentions" policy was not well implemented, and from activists to the masses, there was a general concealment of yields. Now, the work cadres vigorously publicized the "four retentions" policy, and at the same time, they conducted ideological education on unified purchase of surplus grain for the branch and party members, raising their socialist consciousness, requiring party members to play a model role in reporting actual yields, and then relying on party members to liaise and mobilize seventy-eight activists to voluntarily report actual yields, and then cultivate typical examples from here to give personal accounts at mass meetings, educating the masses, and the masses have successively made supplementary reports of actual yields. The average yield per mu in the whole township was reported from 380 jin to 413 jin.
    In the process of carrying out ideological mobilization work, the following situation was commonly encountered in various places: Farmers have been living a small-peasant economic life for a long time, and they do not have a definite number for eating and using on weekdays. Now, when they suddenly hear about the publicity of the "four retentions" policy, when they calculate how much to retain according to the "four retentions" standard, some people cannot calculate it clearly, and they are very nervous, afraid that they will not retain enough to eat and use, and they try to conceal production. Under this situation, the work cadres patiently helped the farmers calculate their living consumption accounts to eliminate their concerns. The Wentufa Xu mutual aid group of Erxiao Village in Wutong Township, Xingshan County, has twenty-seven households. When they heard that each person should retain a certain amount according to the "four retentions" standard, fifteen households could not calculate it clearly, and they were afraid that they would not retain enough to eat and use, so they had great ideological resistance. Among them, the most resistant was middle peasant group member Wang Zuofu, who said: "I have to eat at least one and a half jin a day." The work cadres and the party branch committee helped him calculate the annual living consumption account: If calculated according to his own saying that he eats one and a half jin of grain a day, his family of six should eat 3,240 jin of grain a year, but his income last year was only 2,191 jin of grain, and he also used 409 jin, actually eating only 1,782 jin, averaging less than fourteen liang of staple food per person per day. Now, calculated according to the standard of retaining one jin of grain, 2,190 jin of staple food should be retained, which is more than what was retained last year. Through accounting, his thinking was straightened out, and he said: "I am convinced in my heart when I calculate it this way, and I am happy to sell surplus grain. As long as there is enough to eat, who wants to conceal production?" After calculating accounts household by household, the remaining group members felt that the "four retentions" were enough to eat and use, and reported actual yields.
    Now the grain unified purchase work in Hubei Province is being carried out in full swing. From the past work, if you want to do a good job in grain unified purchase work, you need to strengthen the education of the general line for farmers - encourage them to summarize the benefits of grain unified purchase and sales in the past year, and improve their socialist consciousness. On this basis, implement the state's grain unified purchase policy - the "four retentions" policy, so that farmers realize that this policy takes care of their lives and their production, and is completely consistent with their interests, and they will consciously sell surplus grain.

    国家利益和农民利益完全一致
    ——记湖北省今年秋季粮食统购工作
    本报记者　古维进
    自十月份以来，湖北省的一万零二百七十三个乡分两批进行粮食统购工作。到现在为止，全省已完成粮食统购任务百分之七十以上。
    今年湖北省的粮食统购工作，抓住了两个环节：一个是做好深入的思想发动工作；一个是认真贯彻统购余粮的政策。
    一年来，湖北省广大农村实行粮食统购统销的结果，给农民带来许多好处：保证供应，稳定物价，促进农业的社会主义改造等。但是，由于政治工作和经济工作不能很好的配合，和统购统销工作中存在某些缺点，不少农村工作干部和农民对于这些好处并没有足够的认识。各地开始工作时，在县、区、乡的干部会议，或者群众会议上，首先碰到的就是这样一些问题，有些乡干部和积极分子的问题是：“去年卖粮带头吃了亏：群众不满，家庭生气，今年不干这傻事了。”有些农民说：“统销范围愈统愈宽了，工业化的路程太苦”；“一百四十一项工程少办一点吧”……
    要解决这些干部和农民中的思想问题，必须继续进行总路线的教育。但是教育什么呢？有个别地方首先向农民抽象的宣传“支援工业化、支援解放台湾、支援灾区”，农民不满意的说：“讲的太宽，讲的太远。”后来批判这种作法后，各地都从干部和农民中的实际思想问题出发，启发他们总结一年来粮食统购统销的好处；从新、旧两个市场的对比，和新、旧两条道路的对比，逐渐明确认识粮食统购统销对于农民是有利的。
    江陵县城西区的乡干部把两个灾荒年代的粮价和供应作了个对比说：“解放前有一年闹灾荒，早上一石谷卖十二万元，晚上涨到二十八万元，就是这样，也不容易买到；今年也是灾荒年（水灾），可是今年的粮价一直没涨：去年一斤米卖八百多元，今年一斤米还是卖八百多元，大家都买得到。要不是统购统销，那来的这宗好事。”
    浠水县河东乡的农民把统购统销前后的互助合作情形作了个对比说：“我们原来三十二个互助组，粮食统购前，不少人热心粮食投机买卖，互助组几乎垮台，粮食统购统销后，自发势力少了，互助组发展到七十九个，还建立了三个农业生产合作社，今年组、社都丰收了。”于是他们一致认识：“统购统销要得。”
    在总结统购统销的好处同时，各地乡干部和积极分子对去年统购统销时所谓“群众不满”作了分析，是那些人不满，为什么不满。从大家摆出的情况看，一般是：一、富农和搞粮食投机生意的人对统购统销不满；二、“富裕户”（经济情况较好的中农）感觉统购统销不自由，不满；三、有些地方，统购搞得紧一些，供应没有及时跟上，群众不满。大家经过讨论，把这些不满加以正确的认识：第一种人的不满不能听，第二种人的不满，要教育说服，第三种人的不满，是工作中的某些缺点造成，可以改正。最后，大家一致感到，必须把富农、做粮食投机生意的人对统购统销的不满、干部在工作中的缺点造成群众对统购统销的不满，和统购统销政策区别开来。
    了解了粮食统购统销的好处，并不是说农村工作干部中和农民中已没有了思想问题，有些人说：“统购统销好是好，为什么有些东西买不到？统到哪里去呢？”为了解决这个问题，各地首先启发农民算生产账和生活账，使农民认识供求矛盾的道理。例如，浠水县石河乡干部启发贫农易以松算了一笔账：一九五二年易以松产的粮食比一九四八年增产百分之三十多，可是，一九五二年他吃掉的粮食比一九四八年增加了百分之八十强，此外一九五二年他吃的肉、油，用的布也比一九四八年增加百分之五十或一百以上，而他的油料、棉花、猪肉的产量虽然有所增加，但是远赶不上自己所需要的。这样一算，易以松说：“东西不好买，不是别的原因，生产跑得慢，生活跑得快呀。”农民了解供求矛盾的道理后，各地干部又诱导农民认识解决供求矛盾的办法：这就是必须按照国家的计划发展生产和服从物资分配计划。要发展生产，首先要加速国家工业化，实行粮食统购统销，以充足的粮食支援工业生产，就是为了加速国家工业化。
           ×          ×         ×
    在农民认识粮食统购统销的好处的基础上，各地开始购余粮的工作。
    为了做好这个工作，中国共产党湖北省委会强调指出必须在坚决贯彻购余粮的政策要求下，尽量多购余粮。但是有些干部没有把这个精神完全接受，以致工作开始遇到一些阻力。
    干部对于“尽量多购余粮”是完全拥护的，正如有些人说：“去年只有一大支援（支援工业化），今年有三大支援（支援工业化，支援解放台湾，支援灾区），要不多购余粮，就支援不成。”但是在实际工作中，有些干部感觉任务大，为了完成任务，把“尽量多购余粮”变成“尽量多购”。于是有些地区出现这种情况：为了完成任务，没有很好的执行政策。
    应该指出，农民经过第一步教育——总结一年来的粮食统购统销的好处之后，社会主义的觉悟提高了，但是，对于售出余粮，有些农民还有这样的顾虑：去年粮食统购中发生过一些不合理的现象（如该卖余粮的没有卖彻底，不该卖的有些人卖得多了）；统销也没有很好和统购结合，以致供应有些不合理。他们顾虑今年售余粮还像去年那样。因此，必须进一步贯彻国家的粮食统购政策——“四留”政策，即留口粮、种籽、饲料和一部分机动粮，使农民了解今年售余粮是怎么回事，以消除顾虑。
    但是，有些干部不敢把“四留”政策向农民交代，他们害怕农民了解“四留”政策后，要多留粮食，影响任务的完成。正如洪山县高家乡的干部说的：“要把‘四留’政策都宣传出去，群众要说不够吃，那怎么能完成任务呢？”他们心中有一个想法：“你先卖出粮食，让我完成任务，然后给你‘四留’”，于是，他们的工作部署首先是发动农民报实产量，对于“四留”政策只是泛泛的宣传。农民都发生了顾虑——其实这是很自然的，“四留”是关系每个农民一年的生活和生产的问题，每个农民都是十分关心的，而干部只是泛泛的宣传，农民摸不清这是怎么一回事，怎么不顾虑呢？
    襄阳、黄冈等县的农民说的好：“‘四留’到底怎么个留法？留多少？留不留够口粮？还是要把口粮买走？”在这些问题没有解决以前，农民普遍不愿报实产量。红安县凤山乡乡代表陈世源本来实收粮食七石二斗，他只报了六石七斗。枣阳县陈庄乡农民高在朝本来实收粮食十六石，他只报了十三石。由于农民不愿报实产量，有些干部感觉任务不好完成，于是采取政策服从任务的办法，降低“四留”标准（变为“二留”、“三留”等），或不合理的提高产量，变相的降低“四留”数量。这样一来，农民的顾虑更大，越发不愿意报实产量。宜都县共新乡农民许忠庆的单位面积产量是六百三十斤，他只报了三百八十斤。兴山县有个别乡隐瞒产量达实产量的一半或三分之二。一般农民这样说：“你留得够，我报得实；你要在锅里扣（即扣除口粮），我就在地里留（即瞒产）。”不少地区，工作不好开展。
    中国共产党湖北省委发现这种情况后，及时指示各级党委，说明国家的粮食统购政策，就是统购农民的余粮政策。“尽量多购余粮”，必须在执行“四留”政策下进行。必须大胆地把“四留”政策向农民交代，农民就会自觉地执行政策。各级党委根据这个指示，召开紧急会议，扭转干部不敢把“四留”政策向农民交代和降低“四留”标准的思想。并且重新部署工作，首先把“四留”政策向农民交代清楚：在乡人民代表会上，民主讨论出一个“四留”的大概标准，然后根据这个标准根据每户农民的具体情况去执行。这样，农民的顾虑消除了，自愿实报产量，踊跃售出余粮。谷城县后营乡乡政委员张居谦原先怕报实产量，口粮不够吃，瞒了一石产量，现在听了干部讲清“四留”政策，他说：“我还瞒么产量，我留下的那一石余粮要添上去。”兴山县宝华乡原分配的购余粮任务九万斤，农民没有报实产量，计算只有余粮六万斤，干部交代“四留”政策后，农民都说：“早这样搞，早就报实了。”当下全乡开展一个“补报”运动（即把以前隐瞒的产量都报出来）。结果，该乡除了完成原分配的九万斤任务外，还多购余粮十万斤。
    当然，在交代“四留”政策的时候，也进行了一系列的思想发动工作。这个工作包括：一方面大张旗鼓的宣传“四留”政策，一方面提高先进分子觉悟，和实行串联发动。郧县杠子乡就是一个很好的例子。开始，工作干部大张旗鼓的宣传“四留”政策，明确提出“先留后卖”，“留够再卖”，“留的足够吃，下余的就卖”。与此同时，工作干部首先对乡代表主任韩士勤进行售余粮的教育，提高他的社会主义觉悟，然后由韩士勤在一个乡的骨干分子（主要是贫农和新中农）会上作售余粮的报告。他和大伙一块算了自己的账：产粮二千四百一十一斤，除“四留”二千零三十斤外，还剩三百八十一斤。接着他说：“政府的‘四留’政策，不仅照顾了我的生活，还照顾了我的生产，我把余粮三百八十一斤全卖。”他的模范行为，影响了全体骨干分子都报实产量。其中党员王元华虽然在会上报实产量，想卖余粮一千一百斤，却害怕家里人的思想不通，因此产生顾虑。党支部书记钱正新发现这一情况，就帮助他去打通他爱人的思想。当二十七个骨干分子都报出实产量后，大家情绪高涨地说：“这样我们就好去发动群众，免得刮大风吃炒面，不好张嘴。”他们随即分头在互助组里串联发动。骨干分子龙永兴以自己的“产多少，留多少，卖多少”的事例，发动了贫农互助组长谢从善售余粮，谢从善又带动全组十五户售余粮。全乡通过这些骨干分子串联发动了十九个互助组售余粮后，掀起了全乡的售余粮运动。在枝江县大堰乡，原来由于“四留”政策没有很好的贯彻，从积极分子以至群众，普遍隐瞒产量。现在工作干部一方面大张旗鼓地宣传“四留”政策，一方面对支部和党员进行统购余粮的思想教育，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，要求党员在报实产量中起模范作用，接着依靠党员去串联发动了七十八个积极分子自愿报实产量，再从这里面培养典型，在群众大会上现身说法，教育群众，群众都纷纷补报实产量。全乡的每亩平均产量由三百八十斤实报到四百一十三斤。
    在进行思想发动工作中，各地普遍碰到这种情形：农民长期过着小农经济的生活，平日对于吃和用都没有一个确数，现在忽然听到宣传“四留”政策，自己根据“四留”的标准该留多少时，有些人算不过账来，心里很紧张，害怕留得不够吃，不够用，企图隐瞒产量。在这种情形下，工作干部耐心帮助农民算生活消费账，消除他们的顾虑。兴山县五童乡二小村温发序互助组有二十七户，他们听说每人根据“四留”的标准该留多少时，有十五户算不过账来，都害怕留的不够吃，不够用，思想抵触很大。其中抵触最大的是中农组员王作福，他说：“我一天起码要吃一斤半。”工作干部和党支委帮助他算全年的生活消费账：假如按他自己说的一天要吃一斤半粮来计算，他一家大小六口人一年应该吃三千二百四十斤粮，可是他去年的收入只有二千一百九十一斤粮，还用了四百零九斤，实际上只吃了一千七百八十二斤，每人每天平均划不上十四两主粮，现在按留一斤粮的标准计算，应留二千一百九十斤主粮，比去年留的多。通过算账，他的思想通了，说：“这样算我心里才服，卖余粮也才高兴，只要够吃，谁还要瞒产呢。”其余的组员经过逐户算账，都感到“四留”够吃够用，报出实产量。
    现在湖北省的粮食统购工作正在全面开展。从过去的一段工作看，要想做好粮食统购工作，需要加强对农民的总路线的教育——启发他们总结一年来的粮食统购统销的好处，提高他们的社会主义觉悟，在这一基础上，贯彻国家的粮食统购政策——“四留”政策，使农民认识这个政策既照顾他们的生活又照顾他们生产，和他们的利益完全一致，他们就会自觉地售出余粮。
