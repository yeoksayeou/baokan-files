Sichuan farmers are actively carrying out field management work to strive for increased production of minor spring crops. This year in Sichuan Province, due to excessive rain, crop pests and dislodgement, and seedling shortages are relatively serious. Therefore, Party and government leaders at all levels attach great importance to field management work. In early November, the CPC Longchang County Committee instructed Party organizations at all district and township levels to immediately mobilize the masses to carry out drainage, replanting, and pest control work. The Fushun County Cooperative Federation, in order to support pest control work, promptly allocated 10,000 jin of "666" pesticide powder to district supply and marketing cooperatives for supply to farmers. The "Japanese rapeseed" of the Caomao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shinong Township, Fushun County, was infested with insects. The cooperative members immediately went to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy sprayers and "666" pesticide powder for treatment. Now, the young seedlings are growing very well. A village cadre in Beimiao Township, Jiange County, conducted a general survey of minor spring crops. Using the materials from the production inspection, he used detailed accounting methods to explain that the village could increase production by more than 20,000 jin simply by replanting all the wheat seedlings. This made the farmers realize the benefits of replanting from concrete facts. The whole village quickly launched replanting work, and in four days, more than 36 mu of rapeseed and wheat were replanted. After overfulfilling the minor spring sowing task, the members of the Qianshao First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hejiang County enthusiastically devoted themselves to thinning and replanting seedlings, and carried manure from Baisha Town, thirteen li away, to apply as topdressing fertilizer.

    四川农民加强田间管理
    四川农民积极进行田间管理工作，争取小春作物增产。四川省今年因雨水多，作物虫害和脱窝，缺苗现象比较严重，因而各地党政领导很重视田间管理工作。中共隆昌县委在十一月初就指示各区乡党组织，立即发动群众进行排水、补苗，防治虫害等工作。富顺县合作社联合社，为支援治虫工作，及时调拨了一万斤“六六六”药粉给各区供销合作社供应农民。该县石农乡草茂农业生产合作社的“日本油菜”生了虫，社员们马上就到供销社买回喷雾器和“六六六”药粉除治，现在，嫩苗都长得很好。剑阁县北庙乡一村干部，对小春进行了普查，利用生产检查的材料，采取算细账方式，说明全村仅小麦全补上苗就能增产二万多斤，使农民从具体事实中认识了补苗的好处。全村很快展开了补苗工作，四天中就补种油菜、小麦三十六亩多。合江县前哨第一农业生产合作社的社员们，超额完成小春播种任务后，又热烈投入了匀苗、补苗工作，并从十三里外的白沙镇担粪回去施追肥。
