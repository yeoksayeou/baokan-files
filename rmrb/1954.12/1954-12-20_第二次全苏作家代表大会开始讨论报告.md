    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 18th: The Second All-Union Writers Congress held its December 17th session and began discussing reports and supplementary reports on various issues concerning Soviet literature.

    At the December 17th session, national writers from Latvia, Lithuania, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Georgia spoke in succession. They discussed the development and achievements of literature in their respective republics over the past twenty years, as well as the tremendous influence of Russian classical literature on the literatures of various nationalities. They also discussed how to further improve Soviet literature.

    The famous Latvian writer V. Lacis said that under bourgeois rule in Latvia, a book usually did not exceed two thousand copies, while now forty thousand copies can be sold in a matter of days. The free life of the Latvian people and their creative labor have inspired Latvian writers to write some good works, which have been translated and published in various Soviet languages and foreign languages.

    The writer G. Markov from the Siberian region described the life and creative achievements of Siberian writers. He said that the achievements of Siberian writers prove the vigorous development of the entire Soviet literature. The Soviet Writers' Union should give more help to local writers. He said that life in various places is developing rapidly, and writers have no right to lag behind reality.

    The famous Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg spoke at the meeting. He talked about the decline of Western bourgeois literature, pointing out that there are many talented and hardworking writers in these countries, but their societies cannot inspire them. Many bourgeois writers cannot write because bourgeois society is disintegrating, and these writers cannot escape the spiritually impoverished world around them.

    When talking about the work of Soviet writers, Ehrenburg emphasized that Soviet literature must be true. The writer is not an observer of life but a creator of life. He depicts the spiritual world of people, thereby changing it and helping the people to become more noble, better, and stronger. Ehrenburg continued, we live in an extraordinary era. Never before, nowhere else, has literature occupied such a high and important position as it does today, in our country. The Soviet state, the Party, has provided us with superior conditions. Today, Soviet society is at such a high level that we have the right to expect our literature to achieve an extraordinary prosperity.

    Ehrenburg also said that our congress is being held on days that are very important for the future of Europe and the whole world: the people of all countries know that the hand extended by the powerful, peace-loving Soviet Union can save mankind from unprecedented disasters. Today, we are not isolated; with us are great China, the people's democratic countries, and all progressive humanity. Ehrenburg said that the enemies of humanity, the enemies of progress, the enemies of the people of all countries are trying to stop time from moving forward. We must use all our strength to maintain peace. If these madmen dare to violate the hopes of all mankind, then those who oppose them will not only be people with powerful armies and modern industries, but also people with great hearts and great literature.

    The juvenile literature writer Lev Kassil spoke about the issue of developing children's literature. He said that our young but demanding readers expect us to write meaningful books that tell them how to live, how to love the motherland and labor, and that the images of the characters in the books should reflect the excellent qualities of people in the Soviet era. Writers should write more and better things for children.

    After Kassil's speech, a group of Young Pioneers entered the hall playing trumpets and holding flags to pay tribute to the authors of their favorite works. They wished the writers new achievements in their future creative activities.

    Zhou Yang, head of the Chinese Writers Association delegation and vice chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, delivered a congratulatory speech at the morning session on the 17th, and was warmly welcomed by the attendees. After Zhou Yang finished his speech, he presented the conference with a pair of exquisite vases on behalf of the Chinese Writers Association, at which point the entire venue erupted in a storm of applause.

    第二次全苏作家代表大会开始讨论报告
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：第二次全苏作家代表大会十七日会议，开始讨论关于苏联文学的各项问题的报告和补充报告。
    在十七日会议上，拉脱维亚、立陶宛、阿塞拜疆、乌克兰和格鲁吉亚的民族作家先后发言。他们谈到了他们共和国的文学在过去二十年中的发展、成就，以及俄罗斯古典文学对于各民族文学的巨大影响。他们还谈到了如何进一步提高苏维埃文学的各项问题。
    拉脱维亚著名作家维·拉齐斯说，在资产阶级统治下的拉脱维亚，出版一本书通常不会超过两千册，而现在几天功夫就可以销售四万册。拉脱维亚人民的自由生活和他们的创造性的劳动，鼓舞着拉脱维亚作家们写出了一些好的作品，这些作品已经被译成苏联各民族文字和外国文字出版。
    西伯利亚地区的作家格·马尔科夫叙述了西伯利亚作家的生活情况和创作上的成就。他说，西伯利亚作家取得的成就证明了整个苏维埃文学的蓬勃发展。苏联作家协会应该给地方上的作家以更大的帮助。他说，各地的生活正在突飞猛进地向前发展，作家没有权利落在现实的后面。
    苏联著名作家爱伦堡在会上发言。他谈到了西方资产阶级文学的衰落，指出这些国家有许多有天才的和勤劳的作家，但是他们的社会不能给他们以鼓舞。许多资产阶级作家之所以写不出作品是由于资产阶级社会正在解体，而这些作家又摆脱不掉他们周围的精神贫乏的世界。
    在谈到苏联作家的工作时，爱伦堡着重指出，苏维埃文学必须是真实的。作家不是生命的观察者而是生命的创造者。他描写人的精神世界，从而改变它并且帮助人民，使他们更崇高、更好和更坚强。爱伦堡接着说，我们生活在一个不同寻常的时代。在从前任何时候、在任何其他地方，文学都没有像在今天、在我们国家内占有这样高、这样重要的地位。苏维埃国家、党为我们提供了优越的条件。今天，苏维埃社会处在这样高的水平上，我们有权期望我们的文学获得一个不同寻常的繁荣。
    爱伦堡又说，我们的代表大会是在对欧洲和全世界的前途非常重要的日子里召开的：各国人民知道，强大的、爱好和平的苏联伸出来的手，是能够拯救人类免于空前的灾难的。今天，我们不是孤立的，同我们在一起的有伟大的中国，有人民民主国家和所有的进步人类。爱伦堡说，人道主义的敌人、进步的敌人、各国人民的敌人正在企图阻止时间前进。我们要用全力来维护和平。如果这些疯子敢于违反全人类的希望，那么，反对他们的不但是有着强大军队和现代化工业的人民，而且是有着伟大的心和伟大的文学的人民。
  少年文学作家列·卡西尔在发言中谈到了发展儿童文学的问题。他说，我们的年纪幼小的、但是要求很高的读者期待着我们写出有意义的书籍，告诉他们如何生活、如何热爱祖国和劳动，而书中人物的形象要能体现出苏维埃时代的人的优良品质。作家们应该为儿童写出更多的更好的东西。
    在卡西尔发言后，一队少年先锋队员吹着喇叭、举着旗子进入大厅，向他们喜爱的作品的作者致敬。他们预祝作家们在今后的创作活动中取得新的成就。
    中国作家协会代表团团长、中国作家协会副主席周扬在十七日上午会议上致祝词，受到了到会者的热烈欢迎。周扬致词完了以后，代表中国作家协会献给大会一对精致的大花瓶，这时全场报以暴风雨般的掌声。
