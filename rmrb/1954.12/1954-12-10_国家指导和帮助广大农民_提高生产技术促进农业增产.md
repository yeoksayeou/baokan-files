    Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: Agricultural statistics show that in recent years, as a result of the nation's farmers improving and enhancing production technology with the assistance of the state, agricultural production in our country has been powerfully promoted.
    In recent years, local people's governments have promoted fine varieties such as Bima No. 1 wheat, Shengli indica rice, S cotton, and Manchuria Gold soybean. These improved varieties generally increase production by more than 10% compared to local varieties, and in some cases can double production. At present, the planting area of improved varieties in national food crops has reached about 300 million mu, and the planting area of improved cotton varieties has reached more than 50 million mu. This year, farmers in Shaanxi Province used improved varieties such as Bima No. 1, 6028, and Qitouhong on more than 8 million mu of cultivated land, increasing wheat production by more than 260 million jin. Last year, 80% of the cotton fields in Hebei Province selected improved varieties. The average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the province was 33 jin, an increase of 28% compared to 1949; raw cotton that can spin 32 counts or more accounted for 99.75%.
    Reasonable close planting of crops such as rice, wheat, and cotton has been widely promoted in many areas. According to a typical survey of 207 locations in Hebei Province, close planting of wheat increased production by an average of 27% regardless of whether it was paddy field, dry land, sandy land, or saline-alkali land. Last year, 60% of the more than 50 million mu of rice fields in Sichuan Province were densely planted, and this year it has increased to about 80%. Coupled with other reasons, the province's rice production this year increased by about 1.6 billion jin compared to last year. Last year, due to the promotion of the Guo Houqi high-yield experience in the provinces of Northeast China, attention was paid to appropriately increasing the number of plants per unit area, and the phenomenon of unevenly distributed seedlings and missing seedlings began to change, resulting in an increase of about 2 billion jin of grain.
    In terms of increasing fertilizer application, in addition to vigorously promoting pig raising for manure accumulation, grass cutting for composting, pond mud digging, and planting green manure crops, various regions have also promoted fertilizer preservation methods such as sealing the outside of manure piles with mud, separate storage of plant ash and厩肥 (jiù féi, stable manure), and fertilizer application methods that determine the type, timing, and quantity of fertilizer to be applied based on soil properties and crop development needs. The supply of commercial fertilizers has been increasing year by year, and rhizobium inoculation has been promoted in the main peanut and soybean producing areas. This year, the peanut rhizobium inoculation area has reached more than 2 million mu, with an average yield increase of about 20% per mu; the soybean rhizobium inoculation area has reached more than 22 million mu, with an average yield increase of about 10% per mu.
    The state's guidance and assistance to farmers in preventing and controlling crop diseases and insect pests has also achieved remarkable results. From 1950 to 1953, the state supplied farmers with more than 67 million jin of various pesticides and more than 520,000 sprayers, and vigorously carried out pest control campaigns. Therefore, from 1950 to 1952, farmers reduced losses of about 30 billion jin of grain, and in 1951 and 1952, farmers reduced losses of about 1 million dan of ginned cotton. Moreover, since 1951, the state has dispatched airplanes every year to help farmers control locusts, saving farmers a lot of labor and funds.
    In recent years, more than 8,000 units such as agricultural science research institutes, agricultural experiment stations, agricultural technology promotion stations, and animal husbandry and veterinary work stations have been established across the country, with a total of more than 130,000 employees. Under the leadership of the CCP organizations at all levels and the people's governments at all levels, these agricultural science and technology institutions have implemented the policy of science and technology serving agricultural production. The staff of various agricultural science and technology institutions actively studied advanced Soviet agricultural science, summarized farmers' experience in increasing production, focused on experimenting and researching technical problems urgently to be solved in agricultural production, and carried out technical instruction to rural cadres and production activists through methods such as organizing visits, short-term training, and on-site guidance.

### 国家指导和帮助广大农民  提高生产技术促进农业增产

    国家指导和帮助广大农民
    提高生产技术促进农业增产
    【新华社九日讯】农业方面许多统计材料显示：几年来全国农民在国家帮助下改进和提高生产技术的结果，已有力地促进了我国农业的增产。
    几年来，各地人民政府推广了碧蚂一号小麦、胜利籼水稻、斯字棉、满仓金大豆等优良品种。这些良种一般可比当地品种增产百分之十以上，个别的可增产一倍以上。目前全国粮食作物中优良品种的种植面积已达三亿亩左右，棉花的优良品种种植面积已达五千多万亩。今年陕西省农民在八百多万亩耕地上采用了碧蚂一号、六○二八和齐头红等良种，共计增产小麦两亿六千多万斤。去年河北省百分之八十的棉田选用了良种，全省棉田平均每亩产皮棉三十三斤，比一九四九年提高了百分之二十八；能纺三十二支纱以上的原棉，已占百分之九十九点七五。
    水稻、小麦、棉花等作物的合理密植，已在许多地区普遍推广。据河北省二百零七个典型调查证明，无论水地、旱地、砂土地、盐碱地，密植的小麦平均增产百分之二十七。四川省五千多万亩稻田中，去年有百分之六十密植，今年增加到百分之八十左右。加上其他原因，今年全省比去年增产稻谷约十六亿斤。东北区各省去年由于推广了郭后旗丰产经验，注意了使作物的单位面积株数适当增加，禾苗稀厚不匀和缺苗断条现象开始有所改变，共计增产粮食约二十亿斤。
    在增施肥料方面，各地除大力提倡养猪积肥、割草沤粪、挖塘泥和种植绿肥作物外，还推广了粪堆外面封泥、草木灰和厩肥分别贮存等保肥方法，以及根据土壤性质和作物发育需要确定施用肥料的种类、时间和数量的施肥方法。商品肥料的供应量逐年都有增加，同时在花生和大豆的主要产区推广了根瘤菌拌种。今年花生根瘤菌拌种面积已达二百多万亩，每亩平均增产百分之二十左右；大豆根瘤菌拌种面积已达两千二百多万亩，每亩平均增产百分之十左右。
    国家指导和帮助农民防治作物病虫害，也取得了显著效果。从一九五○年到一九五三年，国家供应农民各种农药六千七百多万斤，喷雾器五十二万多架，并大力开展治虫运动。因此一九五○年到一九五二年三年内共使农民减少了约三百亿斤粮食的损失，一九五一年和一九五二年共使农民减少了约一百万担左右皮棉的损失。而且，一九五一年以来国家每年都派出飞机帮助农民治蝗，使农民节省了大量的劳力和资金。
    几年来全国各地已设立农业科学研究所、农事试验场、农业技术推广站、畜牧兽医工作站等八千多个单位，共有职工十三万多人。这些农业科学技术机构在中共各级组织和各级人民政府的领导下，贯彻了科学技术为农业生产服务的方针。各农业科学技术机构的职工积极学习苏联先进的农业科学，总结农民的增产经验，有重点地试验研究了农业生产中亟待解决的技术问题，并通过组织参观、短期训练、实地指导等方式，向广大农村干部和生产积极分子等进行了技术传授。
