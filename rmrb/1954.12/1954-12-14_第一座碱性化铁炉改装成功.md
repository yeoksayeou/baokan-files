    First Alkaline Iron Furnace Successfully Modified

    China's first "alkaline iron furnace" has been successfully modified at the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory and has begun producing large quantities of high-quality nodular cast iron. By the end of the year, this factory can save the country more than 400 million yuan in wealth.

    In the past, China used "acid iron furnaces" (also known as ordinary cupolas) to smelt nodular cast iron. It required a large amount of low-phosphorus pig iron as raw material, and sometimes the quality could not meet the requirements. Now, by modifying the original "acid iron furnace" into an "alkaline iron furnace," all scrap iron and scrap steel can be used to smelt nodular cast iron, saving a large amount of pig iron. In particular, the molten iron smelted by the "alkaline iron furnace," if applied to the Bessemer furnace for steelmaking, can greatly improve the quality of the steel.

    The Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory carried out the modification work under the direct assistance of the Railway Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways and the assistance of nine brother factories. They started the production test of the "alkaline iron furnace" on September 23, and conducted 20 furnace opening tests successively. During the test process, they carefully studied advanced Soviet experience and gave full play to collective wisdom. After more than two months of hard work, they finally succeeded in the test at the end of November. (Our Jiangsu reporter station)

    第一座碱性化铁炉改装成功
    我国第一座“碱性化铁炉”已在戚墅堰机车车辆修理厂改装成功，并开始生产大量质量良好的球墨铸铁。到年底，这个厂可给国家节约四亿多元的财富。
    过去，我国都是用“酸性化铁炉”（又名普通冲天炉）来熔炼球墨铸铁的，它需要大量的低磷的新生铁来作原料，而且有时在质量上不能合乎要求。现在，把原“酸性化铁炉”改装成“碱性化铁炉”，就可全部利用废铁、废钢来熔炼球墨铸铁，把大量新生铁节省下来。特别是“碱性化铁炉”熔炼出来的铁水，如果应用到贝氏炉作为炼钢之用，可以大大提高钢材的质量。
    戚墅堰机车车辆修理厂是在铁道部铁道研究所直接帮助下和九个兄弟工厂的协助下进行改装工作的。他们从九月二十三日开始进行“碱性化铁炉”的生产试验，曾先后作了二十次的开炉试验。在试验过程中，他们认真学习了苏联先进经验，发挥了集体智慧。经过两个多月的艰苦努力，他们终于在十一月底试验成功。　（本报江苏记者站）
