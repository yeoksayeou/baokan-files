    [Report from this newspaper] Half of the national state-owned coal mines have overfulfilled their annual production tasks. As of the end of November, national state-owned coal mines had completed more than 96% of their annual production tasks. By December 6, eighteen units including Datong, Jingxi, Yangquan, Xi'an, Jiaohe, Jiawang, Zibo, and Xinwen had overfulfilled their annual coal production tasks. Due to the continuous improvement of production efficiency and enterprise management level, the production costs of various units this year have also been well completed. As of the end of October, the cost reduction of various units has reached more than 130 billion yuan. As of the end of October, the profits completed by various units across the country have reached more than 82% of the revised profit plan. The profits generated by Datong, Xinwen, and Pingxiang alone exceeded 100 billion yuan.
    Through the safety inspection in July this year and various preparatory work before that, the safety production situation in many enterprises has improved to a certain extent. In general, the mines in East China have improved and strengthened the management of roof support, rainwater flood prevention, and ventilation to varying degrees, and have formulated and initially implemented operating procedures. Some units continue to consolidate and improve the work plan while implementing the operating procedures. The Zibo Mining Bureau gained some initial experience through the roof appraisal of some working faces in the Xihe Mine. After this experience was promoted, the roof collapse accidents were reduced.
    This year, mines across the country generally launched a labor competition with technological innovation as the main content. The Yangquan Mining Bureau participated in the inter-factory labor competition organized by the province and city in the second half of the year. It not only overcame the serious flood disaster in the third quarter, but also completed the national planned targets. Now it has completed the annual output task more than a month ahead of schedule. In the labor competition, this bureau overcame the difficulty of large amount of gas in the cutting slot, so that the coal mining machine could be used normally. By September, the original several coal cutting machines in each mine had been used, and certain experience had been gained in operation technology. The Jiaohe Mining Bureau created the experience of using coal cutting machines on frames to excavate waist slots under poor geological conditions, which not only increased output but also greatly saved gunpowder.
    At present, many state-owned coal mines that have completed their annual tasks are working hard with full confidence to overfulfill the increased production tasks.

    全国半数国营煤矿超额完成全年生产任务
    【本报讯】全国已有半数国营煤矿超额完成全年生产任务。全国国营煤矿截至十一月底已完成全年生产任务百分之九十六以上，至十二月六日已有大同、京西、阳泉、西安、蛟河、贾汪、淄博、新汶等十八个单位超额完成了全年产煤任务。由于生产效率和企业管理水平的不断提高，今年各单位生产成本也完成得很好，截至十月底各单位成本降低额已达一千三百多亿元。截至十月底全国各单位已完成的利润达追加后的利润计划百分之八十二以上，仅大同、新汶、萍乡三个单位产生的利润就超过一千亿元。
    许多企业通过今年七月份安全检查和以前各项准备工作，安全生产情况有了一定程度的好转。华东各矿一般都对顶板管理、雨季防水、通风等项工作有程度不同的改进和加强，并制订和初步贯彻了作业规程，有些单位在贯彻作业规程的同时，更继续巩固和提高了作业计划。淄博矿务局通过西河矿某些工作面的顶板鉴定，初步摸到一些经验，这一经验推广以后，就减少了冒顶事故。
    今年全国各矿一般都展开了以技术革新为主要内容的劳动竞赛。阳泉矿务局下半年参加了省、市组织的厂际劳动竞赛，不仅第三季战胜了大水灾，并完成了国家各项计划指标，现又提前一个多月完成全年产量任务。这个局在劳动竞赛中克服了割槽瓦斯量大的困难，使采煤机得以正常使用，到九月份各矿原有的几台截煤机都已使用起来，并在操作技术上获得一定的经验。蛟河矿务局在地质条件不好的情况下，创造截煤机上架子掏腰槽的经验，不仅提高了产量，还大大节省了火药。
    目前，许多完成全年任务的国营煤矿，正满怀信心地为超额完成增产任务而努力。
