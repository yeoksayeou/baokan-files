Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 3rd: According to a report in the Indonesian "People's Daily" on the 2nd, Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit, in response to questions raised by Dennis Warner, a reporter from the London "Daily Telegraph," expressed his views on several policy issues.

	Aidit said that the goal of the Indonesian Communist Party at this stage is to establish a people's government that is supported by the people and protects the interests of all classes and strata of the Indonesian people. The people I am referring to include workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie, because objectively speaking, they all demand economic and political freedom from the rule of the imperialists.

	In response to the question of whether the Communist Party would participate in the cabinet, Aidit said that participating in the national cabinet not only does not violate the goals of the Communist Party, but is also necessary. The question is whether there is such a possibility of forming a cabinet based on the balance of power inside and outside the parliament.

	When talking about the West Irian issue, Aidit emphasized that West Irian is part of the territory of the Republic of Indonesia, whether from a legal, geographical, ethnic, historical, or political point of view.

	Aidit then talked about the relationship between the Communist Party and Muslims. He said: The most absurd argument in Indonesian political life at present is that some people say that communism and Islam cannot cooperate for common goals. The history of our national struggle and the practice of our current struggle both prove that these people's opinions are wrong. Whether historical facts or today's reality prove how necessary and possible cooperation is between nationalists, Muslims, and communists in order to unite the national strength to achieve the complete independence of the Indonesian nation. The anti-communist attitude of certain traitors is seen by the Indonesian people as an anti-national attitude, because it can be seen from historical facts and today's reality that the Indonesian Communist Party is an active and important force in the struggle for complete national independence.

	In response to the question about peaceful coexistence, Aidit said that the Indonesian Communist Party will firmly support the policy of peaceful coexistence with all other countries, whether these countries are in the East or the West, in the South or the North, and regardless of their different social systems.

	Aidit finally talked about the issue of foreign aid. He said: What Indonesia needs is sincere, friendly aid that does not come with any political strings attached. What we need from any other country is aid that can primarily be used to promote our industry.

    就党的若干政策问题
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地答记者问
    【新华社雅加达三日电】　据印度尼西亚“人民日报”二日报道：印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在答复伦敦“每日电讯报”记者丹尼斯·华尔纳提出的问题时就若干政策问题发表了意见。
    艾地说：印度尼西亚共产党在现阶段的目标是建立一个得到人民的支持并保护印度尼西亚各阶级和各阶层人民的利益的人民政府。我所说的人民包括工人、农民、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级，因为在客观上来说，它们都要求在经济上和政治上从帝国主义者的统治下获得自由。
    艾地在回答关于共产党会不会参加内阁的问题时说，参加国民内阁，不仅不违反共产党的目标，而且是必要的。问题在于，是否有以国会内外的力量对比为基础组阁的这种可能性。
    艾地在谈到西伊里安问题时着重指出：不论从法律上、地理上、种族上、历史上和政治上来说，西伊里安都是印度尼西亚共和国版图的一部分。
    艾地接着谈到共产党和回教徒的关系，他说：目前印度尼西亚政治生活中最荒谬的论调便是有些人说，共产主义和回教不能为共同目标而合作。我国民族斗争史和我国目前斗争的实践，都证明这些人的意见是不对的。无论历史的事实或者今日的现实都证明：为了团结全国力量来实现印度尼西亚民族的完全独立，民族主义者、回教徒和共产党之间的合作是如何的必要和可能。某些卖国分子的反共态度，在印度尼西亚人民看来，是一种反民族的态度，因为，从历史的事实和今日的现实中可以看出：印度尼西亚共产党在争取民族完全独立的斗争中，是一个积极的、重要的力量。
    在回答关于和平共处的问题时，艾地表示，印度尼西亚共产党将坚决支持和一切其他国家和平共处的政策，不论这些国家是在东方还是在西方，是在南方还是在北方，也不论它们的社会制度如何不同。
    艾地最后谈到外国援助问题，他说：印度尼西亚需要的是真诚的、友好的、不附带任何政治束缚条件的援助。我们需要任何其他国家给予的援助，首先是能够用以促进我国工业的援助。
