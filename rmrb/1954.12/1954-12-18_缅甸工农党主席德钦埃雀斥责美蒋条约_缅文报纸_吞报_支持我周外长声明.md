Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: Rangoon news: Chairman of the Burmese Workers and Peasants Party, Tekin Aye Kywe, delivered a speech on the 8th at the fourth anniversary celebration of the Kachin branch of the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, denouncing the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." Tekin Aye Kywe said that the purpose of the United States signing the "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique is to attempt to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their own territory, Taiwan. The United States is attempting to permanently occupy Taiwan as a springboard for its aggression against China under the pretext of so-called "mutual security." Tekin Aye Kywe said that everyone knows that liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair and a matter of course, and has nothing to do with the United States. Tekin Aye Kywe said that if the United States dares to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, then the lessons of the Korean War are right before their eyes, and it will suffer an even more tragic defeat.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: Rangoon news: The Burmese-language newspaper "Tun Daily" in Burma commented on Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" on the 11th, saying: The arguments in Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on various issues are powerful and fully in line with international moral norms.

    缅甸工农党主席德钦埃雀斥责美蒋条约
    缅文报纸“吞报”支持我周外长声明
    【新华社十六日讯】仰光消息：缅甸工农党主席德钦埃雀八日在缅甸保卫世界和平委员会叫砌分会四周年纪念大会上发表演讲，斥责美蒋“共同防御条约”。德钦埃雀说，美国同蒋介石集团签订“共同防御条约”的目的是企图阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾。美国妄图在所谓“共同安全”的借口下，永远霸占台湾作为它侵略中国的跳板。德钦埃雀说，谁都知道，解放台湾是中国的内政问题，是天经地义的事情，跟美国丝毫没有关系。德钦埃雀说，美国如果敢于干涉中国人民解放台湾，那么，朝鲜战争的教训就在眼前，它将遭到更加悲惨的失败。
    【新华社十六日讯】仰光消息：缅甸的缅文报纸“吞报”十一日评论周恩来外交部长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明说：周恩来外交部长发表的声明在各项问题上的论点是强有力的，而且是完全符合国际道义准则的。
