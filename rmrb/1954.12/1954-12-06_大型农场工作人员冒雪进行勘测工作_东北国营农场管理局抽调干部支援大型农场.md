    [This dispatch from Xinglong Town, December 4th] On December 1st, Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, experienced its sixth winter snowfall. The northwest wind whipped snowflakes across the prairie. Red and white survey flags on the site of the large grain farm were obscured by the snowy mist. Although people wore leather boots and heavy coats, they still felt the cold. Despite this harsh weather, the farm's survey work continued as usual. Bisminov, a Soviet expert in the surveying team, carefully wiped the snowflakes from the lens of the theodolite, warming his cold and numb fingers with his breath, and constantly making records. He also patiently guided young Chinese technicians in learning how to observe. The frozen soil layer had deepened from six or seven inches to one or two feet. Surveyors broke open the frozen soil and planted one marker stake after another. Soil investigators dug test pits three feet wide, six feet long, and six feet deep, carefully observing and recording the soil profile. The young technicians in the water conservancy group traversed the snowy mist to find groundwater test pits. Without hesitation, they brushed aside the accumulated snow, jumped into the pits, and took water samples.
   [This dispatch from Harbin, December 4th] The Northeast State-owned Farm Bureau is transferring many cadres and agricultural workers from farms directly under its administration and the Harbin Mechanized Agricultural School to work on large grain farms. Among those transferred from farms directly under its administration are six production team leaders, ten agricultural machinery technicians, over twenty farm management cadres, twenty-three tractor drivers, and five truck drivers; fifty tractor drivers are being transferred from the Harbin Mechanized Agricultural School. In total, more than one hundred and thirty people are being transferred. These technicians and management cadres all have considerable experience in technical and management work.

    大型农场工作人员冒雪进行勘测工作
    东北国营农场管理局抽调干部支援大型农场
    【本报兴隆镇四日电】十二月一日，黑龙江省集贤县下了第六次冬雪。西北风裹着雪花掠过草原。大型谷物农场场地上的红色白色测旗隐没在雪雾中。人们虽然穿着皮靴和大衣外套仍然感到寒冷。就在这样严寒的天气里，农场的勘测工作仍照常进行。测量组的苏联专家比斯敏诺夫，小心地拂去经纬仪扩大镜镜片上的雪花，用口呵气温暖冰冷而麻木的手指，不断地做着记录。他又耐心地指导年轻的我国技术员学习观测。冻土层已由六、七寸延深到一两尺深了。测量人员刨开冻土，栽下一个又一个的标桩。土壤调查人员挖起三尺宽、六尺长、六尺深的试坑，详细地观察和记载下土壤剖面的情况。水利小组的年轻技术员们，穿过雪雾，寻找到地下水试坑。他们毫不犹疑地拨出积雪，跳进坑里，把水样取出来。
   【本报哈尔滨四日电】东北国营农场管理局正从直属各农场和哈尔滨机械化农业学校抽调许多干部和农业工人，派往大型谷物农场工作。从直属农场抽调的，有生产队长六名，农业机械技术员十名，农场管理干部二十多名，拖拉机手二十三名，汽车司机五名；从哈尔滨机械化农业学校抽调拖拉机手五十名。总共抽调了一百三十多人。这些技术人员和管理干部，都有相当熟练的技术和管理工作的经验。目前，他们正陆续前往大型谷物农场。
