Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 10th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission's Subcommittee held a closed meeting on December 8th. The meeting decided that if the five countries participating in the Subcommittee—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and Canada—all agree, the Subcommittee will resume work in London in early February 1955 to complete the tasks assigned to the Subcommittee by the five-nation proposal adopted by the current session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The Soviet representative, Sobolev, made a statement at the meeting. Sobolev said: In view of the upcoming resumption of work by the Disarmament Commission’s Subcommittee, the Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to draw everyone's attention to the fact that, according to the United Nations General Assembly resolution, the Subcommittee's task is to reach agreement on recommendations that should be included in the draft international disarmament convention, which will stipulate a substantial reduction of all armed forces and conventional armaments, and a complete prohibition of the use and manufacture of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. This resolution particularly emphasizes that the entire disarmament plan must not give any country any reason to fear for its security. Sobolev pointed out: In tackling this important task, we cannot, on the one hand, discuss the issue of an international disarmament convention, and on the other hand, throw open the door to West German revanchist forces. Sobolev said: The Paris Agreements stipulate the revival of German militarism, making a remilitarized West Germany join military blocs such as the North Atlantic Group and the newly cobbled-together so-called Western European Union. The implementation of this plan will inevitably intensify the arms race, lead to a serious deterioration of the international situation, and greatly increase the threat of a new war. Therefore, the measures intended to be taken under these agreements are in direct contradiction to the proposal made by the French and British governments on June 11, 1954, to prohibit nuclear weapons and substantially reduce conventional armaments, and are also in direct contradiction to the tasks facing the Subcommittee in reducing armaments.

Sobolev stressed: On the one hand, suggesting universal disarmament, and on the other hand, carrying out West German remilitarization, are mutually contradictory and completely incompatible.

    苏联代表在联合国裁军小组委员会上声明
    武装西德和普遍裁军互相抵触不能相容
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会在十二月八日举行了一次秘密会议。会议决定，如果参加小组委员会的苏联、美国、英国、法国和加拿大五国都同意的话，小组委员会将于一九五五年二月初在伦敦恢复工作，以便完成联合国大会本届会议通过的五国提案所赋予这个小组委员会的任务。
    苏联代表索波列夫在会上发表了声明。索波列夫说：鉴于裁军委员会小组委员会即将恢复工作，苏联代表团认为必须提请大家注意，根据联合国大会的决议，小组委员会的任务是就应当列入国际裁军公约草案的各项建议取得协议，这个国际裁军公约将规定大量裁减一切武装力量和常规军备，完全禁止使用和制造核子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器。这个决议特别着重指出，整个裁军计划必须不使任何国家有任何理由担心自己的安全处于危境。索波列夫指出：在着手解决这一个重要的任务时，不能一面讨论关于国际裁军公约的问题，一面又对西德复仇主义势力大开其门。索波列夫说：巴黎协定规定复活德国军国主义，使重新军国主义化的西德加入北大西洋集团和新拼凑的所谓西欧联盟这样的军事集团。实现这种计划不可避免地会使军备竞赛加剧，导致国际局势的严重恶化和大大加深新战争的威胁。因此，打算根据这些协定而采取的措施，是直接违反法国和英国政府一九五四年六月十一日提出的规定禁止核子武器和大量裁减常规军备的建议的，也是直接违反小组委员会在裁减军备方面所面临的任务的。
    索波列夫着重指出：一方面建议普遍裁减军备，另一方面又进行西德重新军国主义化，这是互相抵触的，完全不能相容的。
