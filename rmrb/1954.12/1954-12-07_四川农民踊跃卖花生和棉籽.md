    Sichuan Farmers Actively Sell Peanuts and Cottonseed
    In the past, Sichuan Province rarely used peanuts and cottonseed to extract oil. Peanuts were mostly consumed as snacks, and cottonseed was mostly directly used as fertilizer. Since the autumn harvest this year, people's governments at all levels have widely publicized the significance of selling peanuts and cottonseed to the state to farmers, and explained to farmers the benefits of using cottonseed to extract oil and cottonseed cake to fertilize fields. The broad masses of farmers are actively selling peanuts and cottonseed to the state. As of November 10, the total amount of peanuts purchased in the province's unified purchase areas was more than 39,800 tons, accounting for 82.58 percent of this year's purchase plan. Yibin Prefecture has already overfulfilled its plan. Suining Prefecture, the main cotton-producing area, had also completed its plan to purchase 1,100 tons of cottonseed by the end of October.

    四川农民踊跃卖花生和棉籽
    四川省过去很少用花生、棉籽榨油，花生大部分被当作零食，棉籽大部分被直接用来肥田。今年秋收开始以后，各地人民政府向农民广泛宣传了把花生、棉籽卖给国家的意义，并向农民说明了用棉籽榨油、用棉籽饼肥田的好处。广大农民都积极地把花生、棉籽卖给国家。到十一月十日止，全省统购地区共收花生三万九千八百多吨，占今年收购计划的百分之八十二点五八，宜宾专区已经超额完成计划。主要产棉区遂宁专区在十月底也已经完成了收购一千一百吨棉籽的计划。　（袁注轩）
