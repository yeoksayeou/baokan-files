Xinhua News Agency, December 12th—Communiqué of the Talks Between the Prime Ministers of China and Myanmar

At the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China, the Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Nu, paid a friendly visit to China. During his stay in Beijing, Prime Minister U Nu, together with Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice-Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, and other leaders of the People's Republic of China, exchanged views on matters of common concern and mutual benefit to China and Burma in a very warm and friendly atmosphere. Based on these opinions, Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu reached the following agreements:

The two Prime Ministers expressed satisfaction with the development of friendly relations between China and Myanmar since the publication of their joint statement on June 29, 1954. The two Prime Ministers reaffirmed that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are the unwavering guiding principles for the relations between the two countries. China and Myanmar should continue to maintain close contact in order to strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries.

Due to the frequent exchanges between the peoples of China and Myanmar, the two Prime Ministers agreed to establish Consulates-General in appropriate cities of each country, and hope that this consular matter will be realized in the near future.

In order to promote economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, the two Prime Ministers consider it necessary to prepare to open an air route between China and Myanmar, restore road traffic between China and Myanmar, and conclude a postal and telecommunications agreement between the two countries.

In order to develop trade between the two countries, the two Prime Ministers agreed that from 1955 to 1957, China will import 150,000 to 200,000 tons of rice from Myanmar each year; during the same period, Myanmar will import industrial equipment, industrial materials, and daily necessities that China can supply from China.

In order to improve the situation of the people of the two countries residing in each other's countries, the two Prime Ministers agreed to encourage their respective overseas citizens, namely Burmese citizens residing in China and Chinese citizens residing in Myanmar, to respect the laws and social customs of the country of residence, and not to participate in the political activities of the country of residence. The two governments are willing to protect the legitimate rights and interests of each other's overseas citizens. Regarding the issue of the nationality of overseas citizens, the two governments will conduct consultations through normal diplomatic channels at the earliest possible time.

In view of the fact that the border between China and Myanmar has not yet been fully demarcated, the two Prime Ministers believe that it is necessary to resolve this issue through normal diplomatic channels at an appropriate time in a spirit of friendship.

In order to safeguard peace in Asia and the world, the two Prime Ministers hope that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can be widely adopted by countries in Asia and the world. The two Prime Ministers believe that even countries that are currently opposed to each other can establish normal, peaceful, and friendly relations as long as these countries make efforts with sincerity and goodwill. At the same time, the two Prime Ministers expressed close concern about the issue of consolidating and expanding the peace zone. If the peace zone is consolidated and expanded, the current international tension may be eased, thereby reducing the possibility of a new war and strengthening the cause of peace throughout the world. In order to stabilize the situation in Southeast Asia, peace in Indochina must be consolidated. The two Prime Ministers believe that all countries should enjoy the right to national independence and prosperous life without external interference and external aggression.

    中缅两国总理会谈公报
    【新华社十二日讯】中缅两国总理会谈公报
    缅甸联邦总理吴努阁下应中华人民共和国总理周恩来阁下的邀请，来到中国进行友好访问。在停留北京期间，吴努总理曾同中华人民共和国毛泽东主席、朱德副主席、全国人民代表大会常务委员会刘少奇委员长、国务院周恩来总理和其他领导人，在很热诚的和友好的空气中，就中缅共同关心和彼此有利的事项，交换了意见。根据这些意见，周恩来总理和吴努总理达成了下列协议：
    两国总理对他们一九五四年六月二十九日联合声明发表以来，中缅两国的友好关系已经获得发展，表示满意。两国总理重申和平共处的五项原则是指导两国关系的坚定不移的方针。中缅两国应继续保持密切接触，以便加强两国之间的友好合作。
    由于中缅两国人民间往来频繁，两国总理同意在两国适当城市互设总领事馆，并希望此项设领事宜将在不久将来实现。
    为了根据平等互利的原则促进两国的经济和文化交流，两国总理认为有必要准备开辟中缅两国间的航空线，恢复中缅两国间的公路交通并缔结两国间的邮电协定。
    为了发展两国间的贸易，两国总理同意，从一九五五年起至一九五七年止，中国方面每年将由缅甸进口十五万吨至二十万吨大米；在同一期间内，缅甸将由中国进口中国可能供应的工业设备、工业器材和日用必需品。
    为了改善两国人民互相侨居的情况，两国总理同意，勉励本国侨民，即侨居中国的缅甸侨民和侨居缅甸的中国侨民，尊重侨居国政府的法律和社会习惯，不参加侨居国的政治活动。两国政府愿意保护对方侨民的正当权利和利益。关于侨民的国籍问题，两国政府将在尽可能早的时机，经过正常外交途径，进行商谈。
    鉴于中缅两国边界尚未完全划定，两国总理认为，有必要根据友好精神，在适当时机内，通过正常的外交途径，解决此项问题。
    为了维护亚洲和世界的和平，两国总理希望，和平共处的五项原则能够为亚洲和世界各国广泛采用。两国总理认为，即使是现在互相对立的国家，也可以建立正常的、和平友好的关系，只要这些国家以诚意和善意为此而努力。同时，两国总理对于巩固和扩大和平地区问题，表示密切关怀。和平地区如果巩固和扩大，目前国际紧张局势就有可能趋于和缓，从而减少新战争的可能，并加强全世界的和平事业。为了稳定东南亚的局势，印度支那的和平必须予以巩固。两国总理认为，一切国家都应在不受外来干涉和外来侵略的情况下，享受民族独立和生活繁荣的权利。
