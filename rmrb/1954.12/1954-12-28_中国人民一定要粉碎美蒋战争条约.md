    The US aggressive bloc's creation of the US-Chiang Kai-shek treaty is a grave war provocation against the Chinese people. It has aroused boundless indignation among the Chinese people and further strengthened their determination to liberate Taiwan and oppose American aggression. The recently held First Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference demonstrated to the world the firm determination and righteous stance of the Chinese people. This meeting marked the increasing consolidation and development of the great unity of the Chinese people's revolution, a revolutionary unity that no aggressive force can defeat.
    Comrade Zhou Enlai solemnly declared in his political report at the First Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people will never give up until Taiwan is liberated. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the US-Chiang Kai-shek treaty, and no war threat can intimidate the Chinese people in their resolute struggle to defend their national sovereignty and territory."
    The First Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference issued a declaration, unanimously agreeing with Comrade Zhou Enlai's political report and stating: "The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a struggle to defend the motherland and defend peace. We will fight to the end without yielding!"
    The international situation after the Korean armistice and the Geneva Conference had already shown some degree of easing, but the US aggressive bloc continues to create international tension. The signing of the US-Chiang Kai-shek treaty is another proof of this. This treaty seriously threatens peace in the Far East and Asia, just as the Paris Agreements threaten peace in Europe. The United States is attempting, on the one hand, to link the US-Chiang Kai-shek treaty with other aggressive treaties it has established in the Pacific region to form an American aggressive system in the East; on the other hand, it is using the Paris Agreements to expand its aggressive system in Europe, while actively plotting to organize its aggressive system in the Middle East, so as to link the American aggressive systems in the East and West, forming a global military aggressive system. If this sinister war plan of the United States succeeds, the international situation will further deteriorate, and world peace and the security of all countries will be seriously threatened. This is clearly unacceptable to all peace-loving countries and peoples. The struggle against American war plans and in defense of world peace is a common struggle for all peace-loving countries and peoples. On December 24, the French National Assembly rejected the armed West Germany protocol of the Paris Agreements, which once again reflects the urgent desire of the French people to oppose war and demand peace. The Chinese people and all peace-loving countries and peoples express warm welcome and support for this. The Chinese people's firm opposition to the US-Chiang Kai-shek treaty is also supported by all peace-loving countries and peoples.
    The US-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty thoroughly exposes the unscrupulous face of the United States, disregarding international credibility. To cover up the US aggressive behavior of occupying Taiwan and Penghu, US Secretary of State Dulles, ignoring the "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation," insisted that Taiwan and Penghu have a so-called "special legal status" and "special international status." At the same time, he flatly denied the fact that Taiwan and Penghu had been returned to China according to these international agreements after Japan's surrender. However, historical facts cannot be erased.
    People remember that on October 25, 1945, the Chinese side, represented by Chen Yi, held the surrender ceremony in Taipei, accepting the surrender document presented by the Japanese surrender representative Ando Rikiichi; later, US President Truman, in a statement on Taiwan issued on January 5, 1950, also declared that the United States "respects China's territorial integrity." Then US Secretary of State Acheson, in explaining Truman's statement, also said: "The United States has no predatory ambitions with respect to Taiwan or any other Chinese territory. The United States has no intention of obtaining special rights or privileges or establishing military bases on Taiwan at present. The United States also does not intend to use armed forces to intervene in its present situation." Acheson said this was "the basic integrity of the United States" and declared that the US government would never "throw what has been said to the winds."
    However, after Truman and Acheson and their ilk made the above statements, they "threw what they had said to the winds" within a few months. Now, the ruling group in the United States is attempting to use the US-Chiang Kai-shek treaty to legitimize its occupation of Taiwan, armed intervention in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, and use Taiwan as a base for expanding its war of aggression against China. This perfidious behavior of the US government has reached a point that no one with a sense of justice can tolerate.
    It is noteworthy that some responsible British diplomatic officials openly support the United States' overbearing stance of occupying China's territory of Taiwan and expanding its aggression against China, and even advocate that Britain participate in the American war of aggression against China. After British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and British representative to the United Nations, Nutting, made the arrogant remarks on December 12 that Britain was prepared to get "involved" in the American war of aggression against China, another British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Marquess of Reading, in a speech in the British House of Lords on the 20th of the same month, even attempted to erase the fact that Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory, saying that there is "no international document" stipulating the status of Taiwan, and saying: "We do not consider it (Taiwan) to be part of the People's Republic of China." The arguments of these two British Under-Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs are completely contrary to international morality and the international agreements to which Britain has been a party. The British government not only recognizes the government of the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government of China, but also participated in the Cairo Declaration, which confirmed that Taiwan is Chinese territory. The Cairo Declaration clearly stipulated that territories stolen by Japan from China, such as Taiwan and Penghu, should be returned to China. On November 21, 1949, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Mayhew, in reply to a question in the British House of Commons, also acknowledged that according to the Cairo Declaration, the Chinese authorities had taken control of Taiwan at the time of Japan's surrender, "and have since exercised control over the island." In 1950, British Foreign Secretary Bevin said in a speech in the House of Commons: "I think there is no reason to go back on our word and deny the Cairo Declaration." These are the moral responsibilities and clearly stated attitudes that the responsible government of a major power—the British government—has undertaken on the Taiwan issue. However, today, two British Under-Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs are actually attempting to break their promises for their own benefit and collude with the United States to intimidate China! People should not forget that the Chinese people cannot be intimidated; and if Britain adopts such a policy, it will not bring any benefit to itself.
    The Chinese people are peace-loving. We are engaged in large-scale peaceful labor to build our motherland into a prosperous and happy socialist country. Therefore, we hope to have a peaceful international environment. We advocate maintaining and establishing normal relations with all countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence initiated by the Prime Ministers of China and India and the Prime Ministers of China and Burma; our contributions to the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina clearly demonstrate the genuine desire of the Chinese people to seek peace and ease tensions. However, the American aggressors are threatening the Chinese people with war, occupying our territory of Taiwan, harassing our mainland coast, and attempting to prevent us from carrying out peaceful construction. After the signing of the US-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty, the American aggressors are stepping up the delivery of military weapons to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, actively preparing to expand the war in the Far East. The visit of American warmonger Radford to the Far East is for the specific implementation of the US-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty and to accelerate the war threat against our country. The provocative nature of the US-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty, rather than its so-called "defensive nature," can be seen more clearly from this. The US "New York Herald Tribune" revealed on December 2 that the US aggressive bloc's policy toward the Far East is to prevent China from "becoming a truly great power" and "fully industrialized"; they arrogantly believe: "It is by no means impossible to prevent the CCP from consolidating its position... By appropriately applying pressure with US naval and air forces in conjunction with local anti-communist forces, it can be guaranteed that the CCP regime will collapse." This more nakedly illustrates the true intention of the US-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty.
    However, this war provocation by the American aggressors can only frighten those who are neurasthenic; it is of no use to the great Chinese people. The Chinese people have been tempered in the struggle for national liberation and independence and are not afraid of any war threat. The Chinese people are not novices in fighting against American aggression and provocation. The declaration of the First Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference pointed out: "We ardently desire peace, but we will never sacrifice the territory and independence of the country to beg for peace. We resolutely oppose war, but we will never be intimidated by the threat of war. To defend peace, we must resist aggression." This is the firm will of the entire Chinese people, united as one.
    For the sake of peace, the US government must withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, and stop infringing on China's territory and independence. If someone insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people must resolutely strike back against the interveners and provocateurs. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang gang, and smash the US-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty.

### 中国人民一定要粉碎美蒋战争条约

    中国人民一定要粉碎美蒋战争条约
    美国侵略集团制造的美蒋条约，是对中国人民的一个严重的战争挑衅。它激起了中国人民的无限愤慨，使中国人民进一步加强了解放台湾、反对美国侵略的决心。最近举行的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次会议，向全世界表明了中国人民的坚强决心和正义立场。这次会议标志着中国人民革命大团结的日益巩固和发展，这样的革命大团结是任何侵略势力所不能战胜的。
    周恩来同志在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议上所作的政治报告中严正宣告：“台湾是中国的领土，中国人民不解放台湾决不罢休。中国人民坚决反对美蒋条约，任何战争威胁，决不能吓倒中国人民为保卫自己的国家主权和领土而进行的坚决斗争。”
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议发表宣言，一致同意周恩来同志的政治报告，并表示：“中国人民解放台湾的斗争是保卫祖国、保卫和平的斗争，我们将不屈不挠地斗争到底！”
    朝鲜停战和日内瓦会议以后的国际局势，本来已经出现了一定程度的缓和，但美国侵略集团却继续制造国际紧张局势。美蒋条约的签订就是又一证明。这个条约严重地威胁着远东和亚洲和平，正如巴黎协定威胁着欧洲和平一样。美国正在企图一方面把美蒋条约同它在太平洋地区建立的其他侵略条约联结成美国在东方的侵略体系，另一方面利用巴黎协定来扩大它在欧洲的侵略体系，同时积极策动组织它在中东的侵略体系，以便把美国在东方和西方的侵略体系连结起来，构成一个世界性的军事侵略体系。如果美国这个凶恶的战争计划得逞，国际局势就会更加恶化，世界和平和各国安全就将受到严重威胁。这显然是一切爱好和平的国家和人民所决不能容许的。反对美国战争计划、保卫世界和平的斗争，是一切爱好和平的国家和人民的共同斗争。十二月二十四日法国国民议会拒绝批准巴黎协定的武装西德议定书，这又一次反映了法国人民反对战争、要求和平的迫切愿望，中国人民和一切爱好和平的国家和人民对此表示热烈的欢迎和支持。中国人民坚决反对美蒋条约，也得到一切爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。
  美蒋战争条约彻底地暴露了美国不顾国际信义的无赖面目。美国国务卿杜勒斯为了掩饰美国霸占台湾和澎湖的侵略行为，竟然无视“开罗宣言”和
  “波茨坦公告”，硬说台湾和澎湖具有一种所谓“特殊的法律地位”和“特殊的国际地位”。同时，他断然否认台湾和澎湖已在日本投降后根据这些国际协议归还中国的事实。但是，历史的事实是不能抹杀的。
    人们记得，一九四五年十月二十五日，中国方面由陈仪在台北举行了受降仪式，接受了日本投降代表安藤利吉呈递的降书；后来美国总统杜鲁门在一九五○年一月五日发表的关于台湾的声明中，并曾宣布美国“尊重中国的领土完整”。当时的美国国务卿艾奇逊在阐明杜鲁门的声明时还说：“美国对台湾或中国其他领土从无掠夺的野心。现在美国无意在台湾获取特别权利或特权或建立军事基地。美国亦不拟使用武装部队干预其现在的局势”。艾奇逊说这是“美国的基本品德”，并宣称美国政府决不会“把所说过的话抛到九霄云外”。
    但是，当杜鲁门和艾奇逊之流发表了上述的声明以后，没有几个月就把他们自己说过的话“抛到九霄云外”去了。现在，美国的统治集团又企图用美蒋条约使它侵占台湾合法化，武装干涉中国人民解放台湾，把台湾作为它扩大对中国的侵略战争的基地。美国政府这种背信弃义的行为，已经到了每一个有正义感的人所不能容忍的程度了。
    值得注意的是，英国一些负责的外交官员竟公然支持美国霸占中国领土台湾、扩大侵略中国的蛮横立场，甚至鼓吹英国参加美国侵略中国的战争。在英国外交副大臣、英国驻联合国代表纳丁在十二月十二日发表英国准备“卷入”美国对中国的侵略战争的狂妄言论之后，另一个英国外交副大臣里丁侯爵在同月二十日在英国上议院的发言中，竟然企图抹杀台湾是中国领土的一部分的事实，说什么
  “并不存在”规定台湾地位的国际文件，并且说：
  “我们并不认为它（台湾）构成中华人民共和国的一部分”。英国这两位外交副大臣的论调，是完全违反国际道义和英国所参加的国际协定的。英国政府不但承认中华人民共和国政府是中国合法的政府，并且还曾参加了确认台湾是中国领土的开罗宣言。开罗宣言明确规定日本所窃取于中国之领土，例如台湾和澎湖等应该归还中国。一九四九年十一月二十一日，英国外交次官梅休在英国下院答复询问时，也承认根据开罗宣言，中国当局在日本投降的时候已对台湾加以控制，“并在此后一直行使着对该岛的控制”。一九五○年英国外交大臣贝文在下院的发言中更说：“我认为没有理由自食其言否认开罗宣言”。这都是作为一个大国的负责的政府——英国政府在台湾问题上所承担的道义责任和明明白白地宣布过的态度。但是，今天英国的两个外交副大臣竟然企图食言自肥，和美国搭伙来对中国进行威吓！人们不应该忘记中国人民是吓不倒的；而英国如果采取这样的政策是不会对它自己带来任何好处的。
    中国人民是爱好和平的。我们为了把我们的祖国建设成一个繁荣幸福的社会主义国家，正在从事大规模的和平劳动。因此，我们期望能有一个和平的国际环境。我们主张根据中印两国总理和中缅两国总理所倡导的和平共处的五项原则，同一切国家保持和建立正常的关系；我们对于朝鲜停战和恢复印度支那和平所作的贡献，都清楚地证明了中国人民这种谋求和平、缓和紧张局势的真实意愿。但是，美国侵略者却以战争威胁中国人民，霸占我国的领土台湾，骚扰我国大陆沿海，企图使我们不能进行和平建设。美蒋战争条约签订后，美国侵略者正在加紧把军火武器交给蒋介石卖国集团，积极准备在远东扩大战争。美国好战分子雷德福的到远东来，就是为了美蒋战争条约的具体实施，加紧策动对我国的战争威胁。美蒋战争条约的挑衅性质而绝非所谓“防御性质”，从这里看得更清楚了。美国
  “纽约先驱论坛报”十二月二日透露，美国侵略集团对远东的政策，是要使中国不能“成为一个真正的大国”和“完全工业化”；他们狂妄地认为：“要使中共不能巩固其地位，决不是不可能的事。……用美国海空军配合着当地的反共力量来适当地施加压力，就能保证使中共政权瓦解。”这就更赤裸裸地说明了美蒋战争条约的真实意图。
    但是，美国侵略者的这种战争挑衅，只能吓唬那些神经衰弱的人，对于伟大的中国人民是根本没有作用的。中国人民在争取民族解放和独立的斗争中已经百炼成钢，是决不怕任何战争威胁的。中国人民对于打击美国侵略和挑衅，绝不是生手。中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议宣言中指出：“我们热烈要求和平，但是决不会牺牲国家的领土和独立去乞求和平。我们坚决反对战争，但是决不会被战争威胁吓倒。为了保卫和平，必须反抗侵略。”这是全中国人民万众一心的坚决意志。
    为了和平，美国政府必须从台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量，停止侵犯中国的领土和独立。如果有人硬要把战争强加在中国人民头上，中国人民一定要对干涉者和挑衅者给以坚决的回击。中国人民一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋贼，粉碎美蒋战争条约。
