    After 9:00 AM, officials of the local government of Tibet wearing yellow ceremonial robes, teams from various organs and organizations carrying huge banners, and colorfully dressed men and women arrived successively at the sites of the two highway inauguration ceremonies. Along the wide roads, dazzling colorful flags and crowds in various costumes formed a long, colorful procession. People waited with boundless excitement for the arrival of the motorcade. The scheduled time for the inauguration ceremony arrived amidst the people's anticipation. General Zhang Guohua, Commander of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, cut the ribbons across the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways amidst music and firecrackers. The motorcade slowly passed through the towering colorful archways and drove towards the jubilant crowds. The leading cadres and model heroes of the road construction on the vehicles waved to the welcoming masses. Applause, cheers, and singing merged into one, while firecrackers exploded in unison, and costumed art troupes danced gracefully. People offered Hada scarves and bouquets to the portraits of Chairman Mao and the leading cadres and model heroes of road construction. Snow-white Hada scarves, bright red bouquets, and colorful confetti decorated the cars in a riot of colors. The orchestras of the three major monasteries of Lhasa, the song and dance teams of Tibetan youth, and the artists of the Tibetan folk opera troupes all performed their most brilliant programs to welcome the arrival of the motorcade. Dozens of Tibetan children, dressed like flowers, climbed onto the cars and presented bouquets to the model heroes of road construction.

    At 12:00 noon, the two motorcades converged in front of the Potala Palace. The motorcade, surrounded by tens of thousands of people and amidst the sound of saluting guns, drove side by side into the parking lot in front of the Potala Palace.
