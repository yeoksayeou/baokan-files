Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 30th: News from Laos indicates that since the Lao Fighting Forces and Vietnamese People's Volunteer Army completely assembled in Phongsaly and Sam Neua provinces respectively and withdrew from Lao territory in November, in accordance with the armistice agreement, the activities of armed bandits directed by the French side to invade the Lao Fighting Forces have become even more rampant than before.

    In Sam Neua Province: On November 20th, 200 bandits invaded a village near Mang Bon, 30 kilometers southwest of Sam Neua. From November 23rd to 25th, for three consecutive days, bandits continuously harassed the area near the northeastern district of Sam Neua. On December 2nd, bandits kidnapped five cadres of the Lao Resistance Government from Hoa Mang Bon southwest of Sam Neua. On December 4th, they kidnapped three more cadres in Mang Lang. In Phongsaly Province: At the end of November and the beginning of December, 300 armed bandits successively occupied the U Tai Airport and U Tai Village, 60 kilometers northwest of Phongsaly; on December 10th, 200 bandits occupied U Nou, northwest of Phongsaly.

    Currently, armed bandits under the direction of the French side are scattered in Heu Teu, Nong Kang, Mang Bon, Hoa Mang, Ba Thi, Ba Ka in Sam Neua Province, and U Nou, U Tai, and Bong Nou in Phongsaly Province. They receive airdrops from French aircraft and, from time to time, invade the assembly areas of the Lao Fighting Forces under the command of French officers.

    At the same time, in the central and southern regions of Laos, from which the Lao Fighting Forces and the Vietnamese People's Volunteer Army have already withdrawn, the French army and the Lao Royal Army frequently dispatch platoons and companies to carry out "sweeps," searching for cadres and residents who participated in the resistance in the past. They force residents to sign fabricated "indictments" falsely accusing the Lao Fighting Forces and the Vietnamese Volunteer Army of leaving troops behind. They force families whose children have joined the Lao Fighting Forces to write letters asking their children to return home. They even force some young Lao soldiers' family members and women to remarry or humiliate them.

    The French side is also attempting to disband the Lao Joint Armistice Commission, which has not yet completed its tasks, in order to be able to suppress the local people without restraint. On December 19th, the French side formally indicated to the Lao side that, starting from January 1st, 1955, it would recall the French and Lao Kingdom representatives from the central and southern Lao subcommittees of the Lao Joint Armistice Commission and would not be responsible for the supplies and any possible incidents involving the Lao Fighting Forces and Vietnamese volunteer representatives in the joint subcommittees. At the same time, the French side has surrounded the offices of the Lao Fighting Forces and Vietnamese volunteer representatives in the southern central Lao joint subcommittee in Lak Sao, Thakhek Province, and the southern Lao joint subcommittee in Muang Phi, Savannakhet Province, with barbed wire, making it even more difficult for Lao and Vietnamese representatives to move around.

    法方指挥土匪猖狂侵犯寮国战斗部队
     【新华社河内三十日电】来自老挝的消息表明：自十一月间寮国战斗部队和越南人民志愿部队分别按照停战协定的规定全部集结到丰沙里、桑怒两省和撤出老挝国境以来，法国方面指挥的武装土匪侵犯寮国战斗部队的活动较前更加猖獗。
    在桑怒省：十一月二十日有二百名土匪侵犯桑怒西南三十公里芒奔附近的一个村子。十一月二十三日到二十五日的三天中，土匪接连向桑怒东北市区附近进行骚扰。十二月二日，土匪架走了桑怒西南和芒地方的寮国抗战政府的五个干部，十二月四日，又在芒朗地方架走了三个干部。在丰沙里省：十一月底和十二月初，三百名武装土匪先后强占了丰沙里西北六十公里处的乌西机场和乌西村；十二月十日，有二百名土匪侵占了丰沙里西北的乌怒。
    目前，在桑怒省的会头、农康、芒奔、和芒、巴梯、巴卡，以及在丰沙里省的乌怒、乌西、磅怒等地，都散布有法方指挥下的武装土匪。他们接受法国飞机的空投，并不时在法国军官的指挥下侵犯寮国战斗部队的集结区。
    同时，在寮国战斗部队和越南人民志愿部队已经撤离的老挝中部和南部地区，法军和老挝王国部队经常出动成排成连的兵力进行“扫荡”，搜捕过去参加抗战的干部和居民。他们强迫居民在伪造的诬蔑寮国战斗部队和越南志愿部队在当地留下了兵员的“控诉书”上签字。强迫那些有子女参加寮国战斗部队的家庭，写信要他们的子女回家。他们甚至强迫一些年青的寮国战士家属妇女改嫁，或者侮辱她们。
    法方还企图解散还没有完成任务的老挝联合停战委员会，以达到能够肆无忌惮地镇压当地人民群众的目的。十二月十九日，法方已正式向寮方表示：从一九五五年一月一日开始，将把老挝联合停战委员会老挝中部、南部分会中的法国和老挝王国方面的代表召回，并将对联合分会中的寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员代表的供给和一切可能发生的事件不负任何责任。与此同时，法方已在他曲省乐双的老挝南中部联合分会和沙湾拿吉省芒菲的老挝南部联合分会中的寮国战斗部队和越南志愿人员代表的办公处四周，围上铁丝网，使寮、越代表行动更加困难。
