Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 4th: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the Korean issue on December 1st.

    The Soviet delegation proposed a motion at the meeting to invite representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of this agenda item. Soviet representative Malik said that the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue concerns the vital interests of the Korean and Chinese peoples. Without the participation of their representatives, it cannot be expected that the Korean issue can be discussed objectively, let alone that a corresponding agreement with legal force and practical significance can be reached. Malik emphasized that without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the discussion of the Korean issue would be one-sided, as has been the case so far, and therefore would not yield any positive results.

    The Soviet proposal was opposed by the representatives of the United States, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.

    The delegations of Poland, Ukraine, and Belarus supported the Soviet proposal. The head of the Polish delegation, Skrzeszewski, said that the Korean issue includes a series of problems—unifying the country, establishing a unified government, and holding all-Korean elections, etc.—these problems affect both parts of Korea, and without the participation of the most directly concerned parties, these problems cannot be successfully resolved, or even successfully discussed.

    The representatives of the Philippines and Turkey opposed inviting representatives from China and North Korea. The Syrian representative advocated inviting only representatives from North Korea and South Korea and put forward a corresponding proposal. This proposal was supported by the representative of Saudi Arabia.

    Indian representative Menon said that his delegation believed it was necessary for the Political Committee to invite representatives from the People's Republic of China, North Korea, and South Korea to participate in the discussion and listen to their opinions. Based on this opinion, the Indian representative proposed an amendment to the Soviet proposal. The Soviet delegation accepted the Indian amendment. Yugoslav representative Brilej supported the Soviet proposal as amended by India.

    Although the Soviet delegation correctly pointed out that the Soviet proposal should be put to a vote first because it was put forward first, the majority bloc led by the United States, Britain, and France passed a motion to put the Thai proposal to a vote first. This proposal stipulated that only the South Korean representative should be invited to participate in the discussion. The committee passed the Thai proposal by a majority vote. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia opposed this proposal. The delegations of ten countries abstained, including India, Indonesia, Burma, and Yugoslavia.

    When voting on the Soviet proposal, the following voted in favor: the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, India, Indonesia, and Burma. The delegations of ten countries abstained.

    After the vote, a general debate on the Korean issue began. The first to speak was US representative Wadsworth. He attempted to prove that the proposals put forward by the Rhee Syngman regime's representative at the Geneva Conference were the only acceptable basis for resolving the Korean issue. At the same time, he said that the current situation is not conducive to holding negotiations on the Korean issue.

    Soviet representative Malik then spoke. He explained in detail the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Korean issue.

    Malik finally put forward two proposals. The first proposal stipulated the abolition of the so-called United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea. The second proposal suggested that the United Nations General Assembly adopt the following resolution:

      "The United Nations General Assembly,

      "Considering that it is urgently necessary to resolve the Korean issue as soon as possible for the sake of national unification and ensuring peace in Korea,

      "Believes that the countries concerned should continue their efforts to reach an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korea, and that a meeting of the countries concerned should be held for this purpose in the near future."

    联大政委会开始讨论朝鲜问题
    苏联提议在最近将来举行有关国家的会议
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会在十二月一日开始讨论朝鲜问题。
    苏联代表团在会上提出了一项提案，建议邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的代表参加这项议程的讨论。苏联代表马立克说，朝鲜问题的和平解决关系到朝鲜人民和中国人民的切身利益，没有他们的代表参加，就不能指望可以客观地讨论朝鲜问题，更不能指望达成一项具有法律效力和实际意义的相应的协议。马立克着重指出，没有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加，朝鲜问题的讨论将是片面的，正如迄今为止的情况那样，因此就不会得到任何积极的结果。
    苏联的提案遭到美国、泰国和英国的代表的反对。
    波兰、乌克兰和白俄罗斯的代表团支持苏联的提案。波兰代表团团长斯克热歇夫斯基说，朝鲜问题包括一系列的问题——统一这个国家、建立一个统一的政府和举行全朝鲜选举等等问题——这些问题影响到朝鲜的两部分，如果没有最直接有关的方面参加，这些问题就不可能得到成功的解决，甚至不可能进行成功的讨论。
    菲律宾和土耳其的代表反对邀请中国和北朝鲜的代表。叙利亚代表主张只邀请北朝鲜和南朝鲜的代表，并提出了一个相应的提案。这个主张得到沙特阿拉伯代表的支持。
    印度代表梅农说，他的代表团认为政治委员会有必要邀请中华人民共和国、北朝鲜和南朝鲜的代表参加讨论，并且听取他们的意见。印度代表根据这个意见对苏联提案提出了修正案。苏联代表团接受了印度的修正案。南斯拉夫代表布里列依支持苏联提出的、经过印度修正的提案。
    虽然苏联代表团正确地指出，苏联的提案应该先交付表决，因为它是先提出来的，然而以美、英、法为首的多数集团通过了先把泰国的提案交付表决，这个提案规定只邀请南朝鲜代表参加讨论。委员会以多数票通过了泰国提案，苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表团反对这个提案。十个国家的代表团弃权，其中包括印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和南斯拉夫。
    在表决苏联提案时投赞成票的有：苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸。十个国家的代表团弃权。
    在表决之后，开始就朝鲜问题进行一般性辩论。第一个发言的是美国代表华兹沃斯。他企图证明，李承晚政权的代表在日内瓦会议上所提出的建议，是唯一可以接受的解决朝鲜问题的基础。同时，他又说，目前形势不利于就朝鲜问题举行谈判。
    苏联代表马立克接着发言。他详尽地说明了苏联在朝鲜问题上的态度。
    马立克最后提出了两个提案。第一个提案规定撤销所谓联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会。第二个提案建议联合国大会通过如下的决议：
      “联合国大会
      “考虑到为了朝鲜全国统一和保证和平的利益起见尽快解决朝鲜问题是迫切地必要的，
      “认为有关国家应该继续努力，以便达成协议在建立一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题，并且将本着这种目的在最近的将来举行一次有关国家的会议。”
