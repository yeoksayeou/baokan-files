    The Consistency of Yu Pingbo's Erroneous Literary Thoughts
    Xiao Shan
    Judging from some of Yu Pingbo's works published over the past two or three decades, the development of his bourgeois literary thought can be seen to have a consistent thread to follow.
    From Yu Pingbo's essay collection "Yan Zhi Cao," published in 1928, we can see the literary views of Yu Pingbo and some of his friends. They promoted that "literature is non-revolutionary, and if it can be revolutionary, there is no need for literature," and "literary men who cannot hold bamboo poles can only take refuge in the world of art" (quotation from Zhou Zuoren's postscript to "Yan Zhi Cao"). They evaded struggle and declared "art for art's sake." In Yu Pingbo's view, so-called "literature and art" are merely a synthesis of "technique" and "inspiration." Material foundation and life practice are secondary in Yu Pingbo's view. Because the material world, in Yu Pingbo's view, is just an unknowable and elusive "thing."
    "Because the essence of lakes and mountains is beyond super-sensory perception, what you, I, and others see are all the essence, and all are not the essence. It manifests its colors due to the differences in all sensations and perceptions, even to billions and trillions of infinite variations... The Buddhist scriptures often say, 'Observe it thus,' which is indeed a supremely intelligent saying. You should not ask me or him, 'What will I see?' You should ask yourself, 'How do I want to see it?'" ("Yan Zhi Cao," page 8)
    James, the representative of "Experimentalism," believes that "'reality' is just what we believe, and what we believe is 'reality.'" Yu Pingbo similarly promotes subjective idealism of "agnosticism" in his own articles. The material world is unknowable because you, I, and others each have our own views. Therefore, there is no clear boundary of "truth," but rather "you should ask yourself, 'How do I want to see it?'"
    This thinking is reflected in his literary view, making Yu Pingbo believe that creation "is only the competition of urgent desires, skilled techniques, and the 'mind' and 'matter' reflected in an instant" (see "Za Ban Er," page 2). Separated from the real social foundation and life practice, empty talk about so-called "desires," "techniques," and "mind-matter competition" leads Yu Pingbo to believe that "immortal masterpieces are often unfinished drafts that come from outside the heavens, which is precisely what is called 'divine inspiration'" (see "Za Ban Er," page 3). Subjective idealists cannot see the era's life and spiritual outlook reflected in great works, and nervously say things like "coming from outside the heavens" and "divine inspiration." No wonder Yu Pingbo "studied" "Dream of the Red Chamber" for more than thirty years, but in the end, he believed that this great realistic work was just a "nightmare," and "the more he studied, the more confused he became," fully demonstrating the complete bankruptcy of the subjective idealist research method.
    Yu Pingbo believes that matter is unknowable and ever-changing. Therefore, "life is like a dream," and there is no need to be serious about anything. In Yu Pingbo's works, works about dreams, dream encounters, and delirious ramblings account for a large proportion. Reality and dreams are mixed together for him, and it is difficult to distinguish clearly. "Looking back on my life, it can only be said to be 'clear.' As for the various idle sorrows, joys, and traces of the past, leaping like light dust, and never able to stop, what is this? Perhaps it is an illusion of my life." (See "Yan Zhi Cao," preface)
    Therefore, Yu Pingbo believes that humans live in society only to watch "a few movies." "After this scene is shown, the next scene comes up. It's really boring to watch, but it never ends, and if you watch it attentively, it's gone." Yu Pingbo explains that his view of life is: "Who of us doesn't spend their life carelessly? And who has truly carefully chewed the taste of life? ... Muddle through life in a cloud of fog, that's the eternal truth." (The above quotations are from "Yan Zhi Cao," page 117, page 118)
    What kind of ideas does Yu Pingbo instill in people through his works? He tells everyone that life in society is just to be a "guest." Everyone should be polite and maintain the status quo, and not be "radical," because you are powerless to change society, so just muddle through life.
    Starting from the fatalistic "life is like a dream, how much joy is there?" (See "Yan Zhi Cao," preface), Yu Pingbo formed a set of decadent views on life, the so-called "momentaryism." This "momentaryism" is actually advocating the decadent bourgeois thought of "drink today for tomorrow may never come" and "one day counts as two and a half days."
    Yu Pingbo's bourgeois decadent thought of indifference to the country and politics is manifested in the study of classical literature by regarding "Dream of the Red Chamber" merely as Cao Xueqin's personal lamentation of his life experience, and severing the realistic content and the important significance of anti-feudalism of the work, which is being criticized by the literary and art circles. From another example, we can also see how Yu Pingbo severed the patriotic tradition of our great classical writers, distorting them into a group of "completely serene" idlers. In "Tao An Dream Recollections" by Zhang Dai of the late Ming Dynasty, punctuated by Yu Pingbo, Yu Pingbo introduces the book by saying: "The author's family and country were destroyed, he let his hair down and went into the mountains, 'remotely thinking about the past, recording it as he recalled it, and confessing it one by one before the Buddha,' which is the original intention of writing the book." As a staunch patriot in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, did he really "confess it one by one before the Buddha"? The author's "preface" introduces his true intention, which is to make himself and the readers "occasionally pick up a passage, as if walking an old path, as if seeing an old friend." The original preface to Yunjia Edition further emphasizes this point, saying: "This volume contains local dialects and lane songs, humorous and trivial matters, but after a little embellishment, they become excellent articles. Readers feel like they are traveling through mountains and rivers, observing customs, and viewing the magnificence of palaces and ancestral temples, almost sharing the same feelings as picking ferns and wheat ears, and expressing them with humor?" Isn't it clear that "Dream Recollections" is not a "confessional work expressing spirituality"? Zhang Dai's positive significance in writing is very obvious, but Yu Pingbo "only sees the trees and not the forest," distorting "Dream Recollections" into a "High King Sutra" in front of the Buddha.
    There is no end to the erroneous viewpoints and methods of the Hu Shi faction of bourgeois idealists in the study of classical literature. During his lifetime, Mr. Lu Xun constantly condemned this group of gentlemen who reduced and dismembered classical literature, pointing out the true purpose of their segmentation work. The "Qiejieting Essays" and other collections contain many valuable instructions, which have direct guiding significance for researchers of classical literature. I cannot quote them one by one here.
    However, in "Draft Six of 'Title Undetermined'," Mr. Lu Xun has an extremely important statement, which has direct enlightenment for our current criticism work. When talking about the evaluation of Tao Yuanming, Mr. Lu Xun pointed out: "The one who has 'strong ambitions always exist' and 'leisurely sees the Southern Mountain' is the same person. If there is any selection, then it is not the whole person, and if there is any exaggeration or suppression, it is even further from the truth."
    Yu Pingbo treats classical literary works by reducing and dismembering the "fierce and glaring" tendencies in them, which inevitably leads to a serious distortion of these great works.
    In the essay collection "Yanjiao Collection," there is an article titled "Posthumous Fame." In this article, Yu Pingbo also attacks revolutionary literature, slandering revolutionary writers as merely narrow-minded fame-seekers.
    "We have several celebrities who are expecting their posthumous fame as enthusiastically as our common people expect to have lunch and see the sun. For example, Guangchi Jun (that is, the one who changed his name to Guangci) probably thinks from time to time, in the future, I will be the first, second, or third in the history of revolutionary literature." ("Yanjiao Collection," page 45)
    The "learned and indifferent" "common people" are just like this, never "talking" about politics, and everything starts from "taste."
    Yu Pingbo's attack on revolutionary literature and revolutionary writers can clearly illustrate the class roots of Yu Pingbo's literary thought. Whether it is a sutra-chanting Buddhist master or a "learned and indifferent" authority on expressing aspirations, as long as his own class interests are touched, "seclusion" will turn into "grief and indignation."
    Yu Pingbo's bourgeois idealist thought for more than 30 years has been criticized by the literary and academic circles, which is very necessary.

    俞平伯的错误文艺思想的一贯性
    萧山
    从俞平伯二三十年来出版的一些著作来看，可以看出他的资产阶级文艺思想的发展，是有一贯的脉络可寻的。
    从一九二八年出版的俞平伯的散文集“燕知草”里，我们就可以看到俞平伯和他的一些朋友们的文艺观。他们宣传“文学即是不革命，能革命就不必需要文学”，“手拿不动竹竿的文人，只好避难到艺术世界里去”（引文见“燕知草”周作人跋）。他们逃避斗争，宣布“为艺术而艺术”。在俞平伯看来，所谓“文艺”，只是“技巧”与“灵感”的综合罢了。物质基础和生活实践在俞平伯看来都是次要的。因为物质世界由俞平伯看来，只是一种不可认识，不可捉摸的“东西”。
    “以湖山别无超感觉外之本相，故你我他所见的俱是本相，亦俱非本相。它因一切所感所受的殊异而幻现其色相，至于亿万千千无穷的蕃变……。佛经上的经典上每每说，‘作如是观’，实在是句顶聪明的话语。你不当问我及他，‘我将看见什么？’你应当问你自己，‘我要怎样看法？’”（“燕知草”第八页）
    “实验主义”的代表者詹姆斯认为，“‘实在’只是我们相信的东西，而我们相信的东西就是‘实在’。”俞平伯在自己的文章里同样宣传“不可知论”的主观唯心主义。物质世界是不可认识的，因为你我他各有各的看法。因此“真理”的清楚界限是没有的，而是“你应当问你自己，‘我要怎样看法？’”
    这种思想反映在他的文学观上，使俞平伯认为创作“只是迫切的欲念，熟练的技巧与映现在刹那间的‘心’‘物’的角逐”而已（见“杂拌儿”第二页）。脱离了真实的社会基础和生活实践，空谈所谓“欲念”、“技巧”和“心物角逐”，这就使俞平伯认为“不朽的杰作往往是一篇天外飞来，未曾写完的残稿，这正是所谓‘神来之笔’。”（见“杂拌儿”第三页）主观唯心论者看不到伟大作品所反映的时代生活和精神面貌，神经质地说什么“天外飞来”，“神来之笔”。无怪俞平伯“研究”了三十多年“红楼梦”，到最后却认为这本伟大的现实主义作品只是一个“梦魇”，“越研究便越觉胡涂”，十足显示出主观唯心主义研究方法的彻底破产。
    俞平伯认为物质是不可知的，是瞬息万变的。因此，“浮生若梦”，对一切事情就不必认真。在俞平伯的著作里，说梦，梦遇，呓语一类的作品占了一个很大的比重。现实生活与梦幻在他是搅混在一起、不易分辨清楚的。“回首生平，亦曰‘洞然’而已。至其闲愁种种悲欢陈迹，跳跃若轻尘，而曾不得踅驻者，此何物耶？殆吾生之幻见耳。”（见“燕知草”自序）
    因此俞平伯认为，人类在社会里生活，只是为了观看“几本几幕电影”罢了。“这一幕映毕，那一幕接上来。看得真乏味，偏偏老不完，看得得神，倒又没有了。”俞平伯说明他的人生观是：“我们的一生谁不是草草地断送的，又见谁真细磨细琢地咬嚼生的滋味过。……云里雾里妈妈胡胡一辈子，这才是永久的真实。”（以上引文见“燕知草”第一一七页，第一一八页）
    俞平伯通过他的作品向人们灌输一些什么思想呢？他告诉大家，人生到社会里来，只是来“作客”的。大家就应当客客气气，维持社会原状，不要“过激”，因为你们对社会是无能为力的，妈妈胡胡过一辈子吧。
    由宿命的“浮生若梦，为欢几何？”（见“燕知草”自序）开始，俞平伯形成了一套颓废的人生观，所谓“刹那主义”。这种“刹那主义”，实际就是鼓吹“今日有酒今日醉”；“过一天算二个半天”的资产阶级颓废思想。
    俞平伯的这种对国家、对政治漠不关心的资产阶级颓废思想，表现在对古典文学研究工作上的显著的例子，就是正为文艺界所批判的把“红楼梦”仅仅看作曹雪芹个人感叹身世之作，割裂作品的现实主义内容和反封建的重要意义。从另外一个例子中，也可以看到俞平伯怎样割裂我国伟大古典作家的爱国主义传统，把他们歪曲成为一批“浑身静穆”的有闲者。由俞平伯标点、明末张岱著的“陶庵梦忆”里，俞平伯介绍本书说：“作者家亡国破，披发入山，‘遥思往事，忆即书之，持向佛前一一忏悔’，作书本旨如是而已。”作为明末清初的一个坚决的爱国志士，真是这样“向佛前一一忏悔”吗？作者“自序”介绍自己真实的意图，是为了使自己及读者“偶拈一则，如游旧径，如见故人”。研云甲编原序里更强调指出这一点说：“兹编载方言巷咏，嘻笑琐屑之事，然略经点染便成至文，读者如历山川，如观风俗，如瞻宫阙宗庙之丽，殆与采薇麦秀，同其感慨，而出之以诙谐者欤？”“梦忆”不是一部“抒写性灵”的“忏悔之作”，这里不是说明得很清楚吗？张岱写作的积极意义是十分明显的，但俞平伯却又“只见树木，不见森林”，把“梦忆”曲解成为一部佛爷面前的“高王经”了。
    胡适派资产阶级唯心论者，在古典文学研究工作里的错误观点和方法，一时是书写不尽的。鲁迅先生生前，对于这批将古典文学加以缩小和凌迟的先生们，曾经不断进行痛斥，指出他们做这种分割工作的真实目的。“且介亭杂文”等文集里有许多宝贵的指示，对于古典文学研究者更有直接的指导意义，我这里无法一一加以申引。
    但是在“‘题未定’草六”里，鲁迅先生有一段极为重要的言论，对于我们目前进行中的批判工作，有直接的启示作用。在谈到对陶渊明的评价时，鲁迅先生指出：“这‘猛志固常在’和‘悠然见南山’的是一个人，倘有取舍，即非全人，再加抑扬，更离真实。”
    俞平伯对待古典文学作品，正是缩小和凌迟其中“金刚怒目”式的倾向，其结果必然形成对这些伟大的作品的严重歪曲。
    在散文集“燕郊集”里，有一篇题为“身后名”的文章，在这篇文章里，俞平伯对革命文学也进行攻击，将革命作家诬蔑为只是一些胸襟狭隘的名利之徒。
   “我们有若干位名人正在预期他的身后 名，如咱们老百姓预期吃中饭出太阳一般的热心。例如光赤君（就是改名光慈的了），他许时时在那边想，将来革命文学史上我会是第一名，第二名，第三名。”“燕郊集”第四十五页）
    “博雅冲淡”的“咱们老百姓”，就是这样绝口“不谈”政治，一切从“趣味”出发的。
    俞平伯对革命文学和革命作家的攻击，可以清楚说明俞平伯的文艺思想的阶级根源。不问是讲经参禅的经学大师，或是“博雅冲淡”的言志派权威，只要一触及他的本阶级的利益时，“幽闲”就会化为“悲愤”了。
    俞平伯三十多年来的资产阶级唯心主义思想，受到文艺界、学术界的批判，这是非常必要的。
