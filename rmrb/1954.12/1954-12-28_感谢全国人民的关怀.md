Thanks to the Concern of the People of the Whole Country
Sun Kaitang, Deputy Director of the Second Construction Bureau of the Southwest Highway Engineering Bureau

The Kangzang Highway is open to traffic! The successful completion of this great project is inseparable from the strong support of the people of the whole country!

Although the Kangzang Plateau is rich in resources and many low-altitude river valleys have fertile land, the economy is still backward and the living standards of the Tibetan people are very low due to the long-term oppression of imperialism. Therefore, all materials needed for the Kangzang Highway construction project, from every iron nail to bridge culvert materials, fuel, tires, food, oil, salt, tents for living, clothes, shoes, socks, pots, bowls, ladles, basins, etc., all relied on the support of the people of the motherland.

Over the past five years, the scale of support from the people of the whole country for the Kangzang Highway project has been enormous, and the care for all road builders has been meticulous. The rice and flour transported to Kangzang were generally of the highest quality. The pork, peanuts, soybeans, and canned food supplied to us were not only produced or manufactured in Sichuan, Shanghai, and other places, but also fish canned goods transported from as far as Heilongjiang, salted vegetables and ham transported from Yunnan, and bean curd sheets transported from Guizhou. The people of Jiangnan knew that the plateau climate was dry and transported a large number of canned fruits for us. The coastal people were afraid that we would lack iodine and transported a large number of kelp for us.

The Kangzang Highway is often constructed in icy and snowy conditions. The people of North China, Inner Mongolia, and Northwest China specially made leather clothes, cotton clothes, and fur shoes and socks for us. When summer came or when we were constructing in warm river valleys, the people transported single clothes and shirts for us. Before the rainy season came, the people sent us rubber shoes and raincoats. Because construction in the high mountains and forests required cutting through thorns and climbing cliffs, clothes were easily torn, and the people transported needle and thread kits. The plateau climate is severely cold, and it is easy to freeze hands and crack faces when working in the winter frost, and the snow light is dazzling when constructing in the snow. The people of the motherland transported face cream and glasses for us. In order to ensure the health of the road builders, the people of the motherland, in addition to sending excellent medical workers, also transported medical equipment such as X-ray machines and microscopes and various valuable medicines, solving the difficulties in prevention and medical work. From every piece of material from the motherland, we can personally feel the meticulous care of the motherland for her children who are far away on the Kangzang Plateau. The workers in Tianjin heard about the construction of the Kangzang Highway and specially made tents suitable for the characteristics of the Kangzang Plateau. This kind of tent can not only be used for living and office work, but also can be connected to accommodate hundreds of people for meetings or as a club. It is convenient to carry during transfers. The top and enclosure each weigh 60 kilograms, just enough for a pack animal to carry. In order to prevent the workers and soldiers from coming apart at the seams and the sole falling off when working in the snow and mud, the workers of the Beijing Leather Factory specially used silk thread to sew leather shoes. When the workers in Ya'an made leather shoes for us, they ensured that the quality was solid, and if they found any that did not meet the specifications, they promptly checked them out and did not allow them to leave the factory. The workers in Shanghai, in order to prevent our bridge builders and soldiers from standing barefoot in the biting ice water to work, rushed to make rubber waders and shoes for us. The care of the people of the whole country for the road builders of the Kangzang Highway inspires the labor enthusiasm of all road builders every moment, increasing our strength and courage in overcoming various difficulties.

Over the past five years, the materials from the motherland have become increasingly abundant, and various machines and materials have become increasingly perfect. This has allowed us to hear the sound of the great cause of socialist industrialization of the motherland advancing by leaps and bounds on the distant Kangzang Plateau. The factories in Anshan, Daye, and Chongqing supplied us with a large amount of steel bridge materials and steel drills. The workers in Sichuan manufactured road rollers for us. The workers in Weifang, Shandong, manufactured pile drivers for us. The workers in Taiyuan manufactured engineering drilling machines for us. In 1954, when the highway entered the forest area, the people of the motherland sent tree felling machines, which are much more efficient than manual felling. The continuous supply of these machines and materials shows the continuous growth of our country's industrial level and encourages us to push the Kangzang Highway forward with greater efforts.

A large amount of materials were transported to the construction site through very long transportation lines. The employees on various transportation fronts participated in this huge transportation work. Aviation pilots airlifted steel wire ropes for us. Coastal and inland river transport workers used ships and wooden boats to transport a large number of machines and equipment for us. Railway workers transported various materials, fuel, and food for us. In places where transportation conditions were inconvenient, transport workers and farmers used mule carts and wheelbarrows to transport grain for us. After the materials were transported to the automobile terminal, the vast Tibetan farmers, herdsmen, and people from all walks of life enthusiastically participated in the transportation work. They concentrated yaks, mules, and horses from all directions, and even Tibetan compatriots from Yunnan and Qinghai participated in supporting the transportation. They transported the materials and grain needed by the construction site day and night. When passing through areas where transportation was blocked and pack animals could not pass, Tibetan men and women unloaded the packs and joined the soldiers and workers in carrying them. They especially cherished the materials. Sometimes, when yaks squeezed past steep cliffs and squeezed rice bags off the cliffs, the Tibetan people would climb down the cliffs and carry them up. Sometimes, when the rice bags were broken, they would pick up the rice scattered on the ground and put it in their hats or pockets and hand it over to us. When it rained on the way, the Tibetan people often took off their rain gear and even their clothes to cover the materials.

The people of the motherland provided even greater support to the Kangzang Highway project in terms of manpower. They not only sent tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters to participate in this construction, but also sent us a large number of technical cadres. The central government and the southwest region have several times transferred a large number of experienced engineering technicians to the Kangzang Highway project, and selected some graduating young students from various universities and specialized schools to be assigned to work on the Kangzang Highway. In practical training, some of them have grown into excellent technical cadres.

The entire Kangzang Highway is open to traffic. We deeply feel that the completion of this great construction project should be attributed to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and to the people of the whole country. We are determined to work even harder to build the Kangzang Plateau and use practical actions to build the border areas of the motherland to thank the support of the people of the whole country.

    感谢全国人民的关怀
    西南公路工程局第二施工局副局长　孙楷堂
    康藏公路通车了，这项伟大工程的胜利完工是和全国人民的大力支援分不开的！
    康藏高原虽然蕴藏丰富，不少海拔较低的河谷地带土地也很肥沃，但由于帝国主义的长期压榨，经济上仍处于落后状态，藏族同胞的生活水平很低。因此，康藏公路建筑工程中所需要的一切物资，从每个铁钉到桥涵料具、油料、轮胎，吃的粮食、油、盐，住的帐篷，穿的衣服、鞋、袜，用的锅、碗、瓢、盆等，没有一样不是依靠祖国内地人民的支援。
    五年来，全国人民对康藏公路工程的支援规模是巨大的，对全体筑路人员的关怀是无微不至的。运往康藏的大米和白面一般都是上等品，供给我们的猪肉、花生米、黄豆和罐头食品，除四川、上海等地出产或制造的以外，还有远从黑龙江运来的鱼类罐头，从云南运来的咸菜和火腿，从贵州运来的豆皮。江南人民知道高原气候干燥，为我们运来了大量水果罐头，沿海人民怕我们缺乏碘质，给我们运来了大量海带。
    康藏公路常在冰天雪地里施工，华北、内蒙古和西北人民特地为我们作了皮衣，棉衣和皮毛鞋袜。到了夏季或在温暖的河谷地带施工时，人民又给运来了单衣和衬衣。在雨季到来之前，人民又给我们送来了胶鞋和雨衣。由于在高山和森林中施工，要劈伐荆棘、攀登悬崖，衣服易于破烂，人民把针线包也运来了。高原气候严寒，冬季风霜中作工容易冻手裂脸，雪地里施工雪光刺眼，祖国人民给运来了擦脸油和眼镜。为了保证筑路人员的身体健康，祖国人民除了派来优秀的医务工作者以外，还给我们运来了X光机和显微镜等医疗器械和各种贵重药品，解决了预防和医疗工作中的困难。从每一件来自祖国内地的物资上，我们都可以亲切的感受到祖国对她的远在康藏高原的儿女无微不至的关怀，天津的工人听说修筑康藏公路，特地为我们赶制了适合于康藏高原特点的帐篷，这种帐篷不但可以住人、办公、连结起来还可容纳百人开会或作俱乐部，转移时携带方便，顶子、围子各六十公斤，恰巧用一匹牲口来驮。为了使工人、战士们在雪地泥水里工作时，鞋子不会脱帮、掉底，北京皮革厂的工人特地用丝线来缝皮鞋。雅安的工人给我们做皮鞋时，保证质量坚固，发现不合规格的，都及时检查出来不让出厂。上海的工人为使我们的建桥工人和战士不再光腿站在刺骨的冰水中做工，给我们赶制了下水的胶皮衣和鞋子。全国人民对康藏公路筑路人员的爱护，每时每刻都激发着我们全体筑路人员的劳动热情，使我们在克服各种困难中增加了力量和勇气。
    五年来，来自祖国内地的物资日益充沛，各种机器和料具日益完善，这使我们在遥远的康藏高原上，也听到了祖国社会主义工业化的伟大事业大踏步前进的声音。鞍山、大冶和重庆的工厂供给了我们大量的钢铁桥料和钢钎，四川的工人为我们制造了压路机，山东潍坊工人为我们制造了打桩机，太原的工人给我们制造了工程钻探机，一九五四年公路进入森林区，祖国人民又送来了伐木机，比人工伐木的效率要高出好多倍。这些机器、这些材料的源源供应，表明我国工业水平的不断增长，激励了我们以更大的努力把康藏公路推向前进。
    大量的物资是经很长的运输线才运到工地的。参加这个巨大运输工作的，有各个交通运输战线上的员工们。航空驾驶员给我们空运过钢丝绳，沿海和内河航运工人用轮船、木船给我们运过大量机具、器材，铁路工人为我们运过各种料具、油料和食品。在交通条件不便的地方，运输工人和农民们用骡马大车、手推车给我们运了粮食。当物资运到汽车终点以后，广大的藏族农、牧民和各阶层人士都热烈来参加运输工作，他们把牦牛、骡、马从四面八方集中起来，甚至云南、青海地区的藏族同胞也参加了支援运输，他们不分昼夜，赶运工地所需要的料具和粮食。当经过交通闭塞，驮畜不能通过的地区时，男女藏胞们就把驮子卸下来，和战士、工人们一起参加背运。他们特别爱护物资，有时牦牛挤过陡崖，把米包挤下崖去，藏胞们就爬下崖，把它扛起来，有时米包摔破了，就把撒在地上的大米检起来装在帽子或衣兜里，交给我们。在途中遇雨时，藏胞常把自己的雨具甚至衣服脱下来遮盖物资。
    祖国人民在人力上对康藏公路工程作了更大的支援。他们不但派来成千上万的优秀儿女来参加这项建设，而且还为我们输送了大批技术干部。中央和西南几次为康藏公路工程调来了大批有经验的工程技术人员，并从各大学、各专修科学校里选择了部分毕业的青年学生分配到康藏公路工作，他们在实际锻炼中，有的已成长为优秀的技术干部。
    康藏公路全线通车了，我们深深的感到：这项伟大建筑工程的完成，应归功于党和毛主席的英明领导，归功于全国人民。我们决心要更加勤恳地建设康藏高原，用建设祖国边疆的实际行动，来感谢全国人民的支援。（附图片）
