    UN General Assembly Special Political Committee Concludes Discussion on the Issue of Infringement upon Freedom of Navigation in Chinese Waters
    Malik Points Out that the United States Should Be Held Responsible for Chiang Kai-shek Bandit's Piratical Acts
    United States Plays Tricks to Manipulate Majority to Avoid Making Decisions on Substantive Issues
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, Eighteenth] According to TASS, New York: The Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the issue of infringement upon freedom of navigation in Chinese waters on the 15th.
    In the general debate at the meeting on the 14th, Czechoslovak representative Sekaninova pointed out in her speech that Chiang Kai-shek's piratical acts in Chinese waters are a threat to peace and security in the Far East, and the United Nations General Assembly should take firm measures to stop such banditry. She expressed her support for the Soviet proposal.
    Belarusian representative Kiselev also expressed support for the Soviet proposal.
    The Syrian representative said that the issue of freedom of navigation on the high seas should be given serious attention. He put forward a proposal to the committee requesting UN member states to "strictly abide by the principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas and avoid taking actions that may be considered as undermining this principle."
    The Indian representative pointed out that a situation inconsistent with the principle of freedom of navigation has arisen in Chinese waters. However, he said that his delegation could not support proposals that contain accusations against a specific country.
    The representatives of the United States, Britain, and the Kuomintang elements once again blatantly attempted to deny the undeniable fact that the Kuomintang clique and the American armed forces supporting it should be held responsible for the piratical acts in Chinese waters.
    Near the end of the general debate, Soviet representative Malik said in his speech that the following conclusions can be drawn from the committee's debate: foreign ships in Chinese waters under the control of the U.S. Navy have been attacked, which is an undeniable fact; some delegations, including those of the United States and Britain, have attempted to defend the piratical acts of the Chiang Kai-shek clique with various untenable excuses; the U.S. representative in particular attempted to absolve the U.S. Air and Naval Forces of their responsibility for the criminal acts committed by Chiang Kai-shek elements in Chinese waters.
    Malik exposed the attempt by the U.S. representative to replace discussion with remarks slandering the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Malik said that the U.S. representative's attempt to portray the piratical acts of the Chiang Kai-shek elements as "acts of self-defense" is an open defense of lawlessness and tyranny in international relations. The piratical attacks on the high seas against merchant ships of the Soviet Union and many other countries, which are not in a state of war with the armed forces stationed in Taiwan, are not "acts of self-defense," but international crimes despised by all civilized nations.
    Malik said that the British representative, disregarding obvious facts and elementary common sense, also attempted to cover up the piratical acts of the Chiang Kai-shek elements with a slanderous accusation fabricated against the People's Republic of China. However, the British representative has no reason to make such accusations.
    Malik emphasized that the real master who should be held responsible for the criminal acts committed against foreign merchant ships in Chinese waters is the U.S. naval forces. The United States cannot evade its responsibility.
    Malik finally said that the Soviet delegation deems it necessary to emphasize that the United Nations cannot sit idly by and do nothing about criminal acts that undermine the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, violate universally recognized principles of international law, damage international economic relations, and further strain international relations. In the interest of maintaining peace and strengthening international cooperation, the piratical acts committed in Chinese waters under the control of the U.S. military authorities must be condemned, and measures must be taken to stop such acts and prevent them from happening again in the future. Those who obstruct the UN General Assembly from taking such steps, those who defend such piratical acts, cannot escape the responsibility they should bear for the serious consequences that the current situation in Chinese waters may bring about.
    At the meeting on the 15th, in order to obstruct the committee from passing a resolution condemning piratical acts in Chinese waters, the United States played a new trick. The United States, together with Cuba and the Philippines, put forward a proposal to submit the Syrian proposal to the United Nations International Law Commission. This was done to obstruct the vote on the Syrian proposal. Because if the Syrian proposal were put to a vote, the U.S.'s "voting machine" might fail, and some delegations that have always supported the United States, especially delegations from maritime countries, could not vote against the principle of freedom of navigation.
    Soviet representative Sobolev spoke against the U.S., Cuban, and Philippine proposal at the meeting on the 15th. Sobolev emphasized that the adoption of this proposal in effect means that the Special Political Committee refuses to make any decision on the substance of the issue under discussion. He pointed out that submitting the Syrian proposal to the United Nations International Law Commission is absolutely meaningless.
    Under the manipulation of the U.S.-British bloc majority, the U.S., Cuban, and Philippine proposal was first put to a vote. Thirty-five delegations voted in favor. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against. Fifteen countries abstained, including Syria, India, Burma, Indonesia, Yugoslavia, Argentina, Afghanistan, Lebanon, and Egypt.
    After the vote, the Syrian representative said that it did not insist on a vote on its proposal because the vote on the U.S., Cuban, and Philippine proposal had already decided the matter.
    The Soviet proposal was also not put to a vote, because after the Soviet delegation announced its support for the Syrian proposal, it did not insist on a vote on its proposal.
    The Special Political Committee of the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly has thus concluded its work.

### 马立克指出美国应对蒋贼海盗行为负责

    联大特别政委会结束关于侵犯中国海面航行自由问题的讨论
    马立克指出美国应对蒋贼海盗行为负责
    美国玩弄花样操纵多数规避对实质问题作出决定
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会特别政治委员会十五日结束了关于侵犯在中国海面的航行自由问题的讨论。
    在十四日会议上的一般性辩论中，捷克斯洛伐克代表塞卡尼诺娃发言指出，蒋介石在中国海面上的海盗行为是对远东和平和安全的威胁，联合国大会应该采取坚决措施来制止这种匪盗行为。她表示支持苏联提案。
    白俄罗斯代表基谢列夫也表示支持苏联提案。
    叙利亚代表说，公海航行自由问题应该受到严重的注意。他向委员会提出一个提案，要求联合国会员国“严格遵守公海航行自由原则，避免采取可能被认为是破坏这一原则的行为”。
    印度代表指出，在中国海面产生了一种不符合航行自由原则的情况。不过他说，他的代表团不能支持包含有对某一具体国家的指责的提案。
    美国、英国和国民党分子的代表再次露骨地企图否认国民党集团和支持它的美国武装部队应该对中国海面的海盗行为负责这个不容置辩的事实。
    在一般性辩论快结束时，苏联代表马立克发言说，从委员会的辩论中可以得出下列结论：在美国海军控制下的中国海面外国船只受到过袭击，这是不容置辩的事实；包括美国和英国在内的一些代表团企图用种种不能自圆其说的借口来为蒋介石集团的海盗行为辩护；美国代表特别企图替美国海空军解脱对蒋介石分子在中国海面所干出的罪恶行为应负的责任。
    马立克揭露了美国代表想以污蔑苏联和中华人民共和国的言论来代替讨论的企图。马立克说，美国代表企图把蒋介石分子的海盗行为说成是“自卫行为”，这是公开地为国际关系上无法无天、横行霸道的行为辩护。苏联等许多并没有同驻在台湾的武装部队处于交战状态的国家的商船在中国海面受到海盗式的攻击，这不是“自卫行为”，而是一切文明国家所不齿的国际罪行。
    马立克说，英国代表也不顾明显的事实和起码的常识，企图用一种诽谤中华人民共和国的捏造的指责来掩饰蒋介石分子的海盗行为。但是英国代表却没有任何理由可以作这种指责。
    马立克强调指出，应该对在中国海面对外国商船干出的罪恶行为负责的真正主人是美国海军部队。美国是不能规避责任的。
    马立克最后说，苏联代表团有必要着重指出，联合国不能对破坏联合国宪章的宗旨和原则、违反公认的国际法原则、损害了国际经济关系、并且使国际关系更加紧张的罪恶行动，坐视不管。为了维护和平和巩固国际合作的利益，必须谴责在美国军事当局控制的中国海面所干出的海盗行为，必须采取措施来制止这种行为，并且防止这种事情将来再次发生。那些阻挠联合国大会采取这种步骤的人，那些为这种海盗行为辩护的人决逃避不了他们对中国海面目前情况可能产生的严重后果所应负的责任。
    在十五日会议上，美国为了阻挠委员会通过谴责中国海面的海盗行为的决议，玩弄了一个新的花样。美国同古巴和菲律宾一道提出了一个提案，建议把叙利亚的提案提交联合国国际法委员会。这样做就是为了阻挠表决叙利亚提案。因为如果叙利亚提案交付表决的话，美国的“表决机器”可能失灵，一向支持美国的一些代表团，特别是海运国家的代表团不能投票反对航行自由原则。
    苏联代表索波列夫在十五日发言反对美国、古巴、菲律宾三国提案。索波列夫着重指出，通过这个提案事实上就是说特别政治委员会拒绝在所讨论的问题的实质上作出任何决定。他指出，把叙利亚提案提交联合国国际法委员会是绝对没有意义的。
    在美英集团多数的操纵下，美国、古巴和菲律宾三国提案首先付表决。投赞成票的有三十五个代表团。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克投反对票。十五个国家弃权，其中包括叙利亚、印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、南斯拉夫、阿根廷、阿富汗、黎巴嫩和埃及。
    表决后，叙利亚代表说，它并不坚持表决它的提案，因为对美国、古巴、菲律宾三国提案的表决已经决定了这个问题。
    苏联提案也没有交付表决，因为苏联代表团宣布支持叙利亚提案以后，就不坚持表决它的提案。
    联合国大会第九届会议特别政治委员会至此结束了它的工作。
