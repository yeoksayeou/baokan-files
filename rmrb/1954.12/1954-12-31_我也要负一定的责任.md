    I Also Bear Certain Responsibility
    Wu Jizong, Engineer, Zhenjiang Hydropower Plant, Jiangsu

    The boiler water tank explosion accident that occurred at the Zhenjiang Hydropower Plant on June 17th this year caused great losses to the people. I was the designer of the "superheater" flushing operation and bear a great responsibility for this accident.

    I have been working at the Zhenjiang Power Plant for seven or eight years and am relatively familiar with the plant's situation. Since liberation, I have made some contributions to production, which gradually fostered pride and complacency. For example, I mistakenly believed that local industry had no future, that there were few opportunities for training in small factories, that technical levels could not be improved, and that there were many work difficulties. A series of personal plans made me lose interest in my current work and adopt a perfunctory attitude towards the plant's major tasks; I often did specific work carelessly. During this "superheater" flushing, I thought I was familiar with the situation of a certain boiler and finished the design in only half a day. I did not consider the actual conditions of the plant at all, what problems to pay attention to during the process, and even less did I take safety measures, resulting in the boiler water tank explosion accident. After liberation, the people trusted their own engineering and technical personnel and entrusted us with significant responsibilities, but I did not take my responsibilities seriously. This accident made me deeply realize that if everyone does not work conscientiously and responsibly, the country's construction work will be damaged, socialist cause will be affected, and personal ideological level is not improved, and no one can make greater contributions to the people's cause.

    The disunity of engineering and technical personnel is also one of the causes of this accident. My relationship with Zhou Niantai, the acting chief engineer of this plant, has always been very bad. We usually don't communicate on technical issues, despise each other, and even develop to the point of keeping technical secrets from each other and taking pleasure in each other's misfortunes. The workers criticized us as: "Sitting face to face, yet separated by a thousand miles." This criticism is consistent with reality. Zhou Niantai and I were classmates in the past, and he also introduced me to the Zhenjiang Hydropower Plant. However, during our time working together, we could not humbly learn from each other's strengths and make up for our weaknesses, but instead competed with each other. We have never studied the major technical problems of the whole plant together. I think that if we could have seriously studied the "boiler water tank" design together, we could have blocked the loopholes in this accident during the design stage. However, due to the disunity between us, the country suffered such a major loss. Now, I deeply realize that to do a good job in a factory's production, we must rely on the collective, on the common unity of everyone, abandon personal gains and losses, and give full play to the strength of the collective. This accident educated us, and now the relationship between me and Acting Chief Engineer Zhou has improved somewhat.

    In the future, I am determined to effectively improve my ideological level, improve my work, cherish the factory and the country's wealth as if they were my own eyes, take on the task of developing local industry, and strive to complete the historical task of socialist industrialization.

    我也要负一定的责任
    江苏镇江水电厂工程师　吴继宗
    今年六月十七日镇江水电厂发生的给水箱爆炸事故，给人民带来了极大的损失。我是这次冲洗
  “过热器”工作的设计人，对这次事故负有很大的责任。
    我在镇江发电厂工作已经有七、八年了，对厂里的情况比较熟悉，解放后在生产上也有一些贡献，因而骄傲自满情绪慢慢滋长起来了。例如我错误的认为地方工业没有发展前途，在小厂里锻炼机会少，技术水平不能提高，工作困难多。一连串的个人打算，使我对现在的工作不发生兴趣，对厂里重大工作抱着敷衍维持态度；对具体工作常草率了事。这次冲洗“过热器”时，我认为某号锅炉的情况我是熟悉的，只化了半天时间就设计好了，对本厂的实际条件，和在进行中要注意些什么问题，根本没有考虑到，更没有作安全措施，结果发生了给水箱爆炸事故。解放后，人民信赖自己的工程技术人员，交付了我们重大的责任，我却没有认真负起责任来。这次事故，使我深深认识到，如果每一个人不认真负责的劳动，国家建设工作就会受到损害，社会主义事业就会受到影响，个人的思想水平不提高，就不能对人民事业作出更多的贡献。
    工程技术人员的不团结，也是造成这次事故的原因之一。我与本厂代总工程师周念泰同志的关系一向很不好，平时在技术问题上互不通气，相互轻视，甚至发展到相互保守技术秘密和幸灾乐祸的程度。工人们批评我们是：“人坐对面，相隔千里”，这个批评是符合实际的。我与周念泰同志过去是同班同学，我到镇江水电厂也是他介绍来的。但是在一起工作期间，大家不能虚心的取长补短，相互学习，而是互相比“妙头”。全厂的重大技术问题，我们也没有一道研究过。我想，在设计“给水箱”时，如果我们能一起认真研究，在设计时就可堵塞了这个事故的漏洞。但是，由于我们个人之间不团结，竟使国家遭受了如此重大的损失。现在，我深深认识到：要作好一个工厂的生产事业，必须依靠集体，依靠大家的共同团结，放弃个人得失，发挥集体的力量。这次事故教育了我们，现在我和周代总工程师之间的关系已有了一些改善。
    今后，我决心切实提高自己的思想水平，改进工作，要像爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护工厂，爱护国家财富，把搞好地方工业的任务担当起来，为完成社会主义工业化的历史任务而奋斗。
