Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 12th: A special correspondent reports: The United Nations General Assembly held plenary sessions on the 9th and 10th to discuss the "indictment case" proposed by the United States regarding the sentence passed on a group of American spies by the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China.

During the discussion, the US delegation tried its best to exonerate the exposed American spies, keeping silent about the facts revealed in the Beijing trial. The US delegation attempted to deny the espionage activities of the convicted American spies, insisting that they should be regarded as prisoners of war and repatriated. Representatives of countries that participated in the Korean War alongside the United States and those who obediently followed US foreign policy supported the US "indictment case," although they could not offer any convincing reasons to defend their position.

Some delegations, including those from Syria and India, opposed the US "indictment" against the People's Republic of China. They emphasized that the UN General Assembly cannot discuss the actions of a country without the participation of the country's representatives, especially when there are opposing opinions on the issue and the issue itself has not been studied beforehand.

Representatives of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia spoke, exposing the US delegation's attempt to conceal and exonerate the exposed American spies and to portray the sentencing of these spies as a violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Soviet representative Malik pointed out in his speech that the sentencing of the American spies was based on documentary materials, physical evidence, interrogation materials, and the confessions of the defendants. In response to those representatives who attempted to demand the release of the convicted spies under the guise of humanitarianism, Malik mentioned the hundreds and thousands of Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war massacred in the Koje-do POW camp, and the tens of thousands of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war forcibly detained in violation of the Geneva Conventions and the Korean Armistice Agreement. Malik pointed out that the United States, Britain, and other representatives who are now talking about human rights have never condemned the inhumane treatment inflicted on Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by the US military command. Apparently, some gentlemen only express humanitarianism when American spies are in trouble.

Malik said that the case of the two aircraft transporting American spies now mentioned is only an example of the extensive espionage activities carried out by certain American groups against other countries.

Malik said that the US delegation is trying every means to discuss the issue of the American spies sentenced in China in the United Nations in order to use the United Nations to incite hostility and hatred towards the People's Republic of China, and to divert world public opinion from the aggressive actions taken by some people against the People's Republic of China.

Polish representative Skrzeszewski pointed out that the issue of the American spies being captured and sentenced by the People's Republic of China is entirely a matter of China's exercise of judicial power, and discussing this issue in the United Nations is a violation of the UN Charter and will exacerbate international tensions.

Ukrainian representative L.F. Palamarchuk said that the United States wants the General Assembly to discuss the issue of the American spies sentenced in China in order to intensify the propaganda campaign against the People's Republic of China, but whether the American reactionary groups are happy or not, the role and status of the People's Republic of China as a major country in international affairs is growing day by day. Attempting to force the General Assembly to interfere in the issue of the sentenced American spies is interfering in China's internal affairs and infringing on China's sovereignty.

Czechoslovak representative G. Sekaninova emphasized that defending against foreign spies is an inalienable right of any country.

Belarusian representative K.V. Kiselev pointed out that the proposal forced upon the General Assembly by the United States and its allies will deal a new blow to the prestige of the United Nations.

Malik said that the Soviet delegation believes that there is no basis for calling these convicted spies "prisoners of war," based on the facts and evidence determined by the verdict of the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China. He said that the Chinese people have ample reason to express anger over the fact that the US military command in Korea abducted tens of thousands of Chinese prisoners of war after the signing of the armistice agreement. These prisoners of war are truly prisoners of war, not spies. Malik said that the issue of these Chinese prisoners of war has not been resolved, and the General Assembly must study it in the future.

Malik said that the US delegation has not mentioned a word about an important issue brought to the attention of the General Assembly by the Soviet delegation. This is the military treaty concluded between the United States and the Kuomintang clique on December 2nd of this year, which sharpens the situation in the Far East and turns the Taiwan region into a hotbed of war threats, which violates the will of those who truly hope for peace and the development of friendly relations between countries.

Malik concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation opposes the proposal that the United States and those countries that participated in the Korean War alongside the United States are trying to force upon the General Assembly, and will vote against this proposal.

The majority controlled by the United States in the United Nations General Assembly finally passed the proposal put forward by the sixteen countries represented by the US delegation who participated in the Korean War. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted against it. The delegations of six countries, including Afghanistan, Burma, India, Indonesia, Yemen, and Yugoslavia, abstained.

The plenary session also discussed the West Irian issue. Due to the obstructionist attitude of certain colonial countries, the proposal to call on the Netherlands and Indonesia to resume negotiations to peacefully resolve the dispute did not receive the necessary two-thirds majority and was rejected.

    美国操纵联大通过所谓“控诉”我国判处美国间谍的提案
    马立克斥美国妄图掩藏侵略我国的罪行
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约十二日讯：特派记者报道：联合国大会九日和十日举行全体会议，讨论美国就中华人民共和国最高人民法院军事审判庭判处一批美国间谍所提出的“控诉案”。
    在讨论中，美国代表团竭力企图开脱被破获的美国间谍的罪行，闭口不提在北京审判中所揭发的事实。美国代表团企图否认被判罪的美国间谍的间谍活动，硬说应当把他们看作是战俘而予以遣返。同美国一道参加侵略朝鲜的战争的国家的代表以及那些驯顺地追随美国外交政策的代表，支持美国的“控诉案”，虽然他们拿不出任何令人信服的理由来为自己的立场辩护。
    某些代表团，包括叙利亚和印度的代表在内，反对美国对中华人民共和国的“控诉”。他们着重指出，在没有当事国的代表参加下，尤其是在讨论的问题存在对立意见，而问题本身又没有事先加以研究的情况下，联合国大会是不能够讨论这一个国家的行动的。
    苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表发言揭露了美国代表团企图掩饰和开脱被揭发的美国间谍的罪行并且把判处这些间谍说成是违反朝鲜停战协定的行为。
    苏联代表马立克发言指出，对美国间谍的判处是根据文件材料、实物证据、侦讯材料和被告的口供作出的。马立克在回答那些企图以人道主义为借口来要求释放被判罪的间谍的代表时，提到在巨济岛战俘营中被屠杀的成千成百中国和北朝鲜的被俘人员，提到在违反日内瓦公约和朝鲜停战协定的情况下被强迫扣留的数万名朝中被俘人员。马立克指出，美国、英国及其他正在高谈人权的代表从前丝毫没有谴责过美军司令部对朝中被俘人员所施加的灭绝人性的待遇。显然，某些大人先生们只在美国间谍陷于困境时才表示人道主义。
    马立克说，现在所提到的两架飞机运送美国间谍一事，只不过是美国某些集团为了反对其他国家而实行的广泛间谍活动的一个例子。
    马立克说，美国代表团想尽一切办法要在联合国讨论关于被中国判刑的美国间谍的问题，是要利用联合国来煽动对中华人民共和国的敌视和仇恨，并且是要转移世界舆论对某些人对中华人民共和国采取侵略行动的注意。
    波兰代表斯克热歇夫斯基指出，关于美国间谍被中华人民共和国捕获和判刑的问题完全是中国行使司法权的问题，在联合国讨论这一问题是破坏联合国宪章的，并且会加剧国际紧张局势。
    乌克兰代表勒·弗·帕拉马尔楚克说，美国要大会讨论关于被中国判刑的美国间谍的问题，是为了加紧进行反对中华人民共和国的宣传运动，但是不管美国反动集团高兴或者是不高兴，中华人民共和国作为一个大国在国际事务中的作用和地位是与日俱增的。企图迫使大会干涉关于被判刑的美国间谍的问题，是干涉中国的内政和侵犯中国的主权。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表格·塞卡尼诺娃着重指出，防御外国间谍是任何国家不可剥夺的权利。
    白俄罗斯代表库·维·基谢列夫指出，美国以及它的同盟者强迫大会接受的提案将使联合国的威信受到新的打击。
    马立克说，苏联代表团根据中华人民共和国最高人民法院军事审判庭判决书所确定的事实和证据，认为把这些已被判罪的间谍称为“战俘”是没有任何根据的。他说，中国人民才有充分的理由对被在朝鲜的美军司令部在停战协定签订后劫走成千成万中国战俘的事实表示愤怒，这些战俘真正是战俘而不是间谍。马立克说，关于这些中国战俘问题还没有解决，大会将来必须研究它。
    马立克说，美国代表团对于苏联代表团提请大会注意的一个重要问题只字未提。这就是今年十二月二日美国和国民党集团缔结的军事条约，这个条约使远东局势尖锐化，并且使台湾地区变为战争威胁的温床，这是违背真正希望和平和发展各国间友好关系的人们的意志的。
    马立克最后说，苏联代表团反对美国以及那些和美国一道参加侵略朝鲜的战争的国家企图强迫大会接受的提案，并将投票反对这一个提案。
    联合国大会里美国所控制的多数最后通过了美国代表团代表参加侵略朝鲜的战争的十六个国家提出的提案。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表团投票反对。阿富汗、缅甸、印度、印度尼西亚、也门和南斯拉夫等六国代表团弃权。
    全体会议还讨论了西伊里安问题。由于某些殖民国家采取阻挠的态度，关于呼吁荷兰和印度尼西亚恢复谈判以和平解决争端的提案没有得到必要的三分之二多数赞成票而被否决。
