Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 10th: As previously reported in the newspapers, the governments of France, Britain, and the United States, on November 29, 1954, delivered replies to the Soviet government's notes of October 23 and November 13, 1954, through their embassies in Moscow.

The full text of the French government's note was published in Soviet newspapers on December 2nd.

On December 9th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered the Soviet government's replies to the French, British, and American embassies in Moscow.

The full text of the Soviet government's note to the French government is as follows:

The Soviet government has received the French government's reply of November 29th to the Soviet government's notes of October 23rd and November 13th, 1954.

The Soviet government regrets to learn that the French government does not believe it can attend a conference to jointly study the issue of European collective security with other European countries.

It is clear from the French government's note that the French government also does not accept the Soviet government's proposal to hold a meeting of the foreign ministers of France, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to discuss the issue of restoring German unification and holding free all-German elections, as well as convening an all-European conference with the aim of establishing a European collective security system.

The French government not only refuses to participate in the all-European conference and refuses to study the Soviet government's proposals regarding a European collective security system, but also fails to put forward any suggestions of its own regarding safeguarding European collective security. Everyone knows that the French government, together with the countries participating in the North Atlantic bloc, is preventing other European countries from participating in this conference.

Therefore, the French government's attitude proves that it does not want to reach an agreement with other European countries on how to consolidate European peace and is hindering the establishment of an effective European security system.

Instead of establishing an effective European collective security system, the French government is doing everything possible to get the Paris Agreements ratified. These agreements aim to remilitarize West Germany and bring it into the aggressive North Atlantic bloc and other military blocs composed of Western countries that oppose peace-loving European nations. This policy will turn West Germany into a militarist country and will have all sorts of dangerous consequences. Needless to say, the remilitarization of West Germany will make it impossible to merge it with the peace-loving German Democratic Republic into a unified country.

Whether in the Soviet Union, France, or other European countries, the revival of West German militarism cannot but cause anxiety about the future fate of European peace. The French government cannot be unaware that the so-called "restrictions" on German militarism and the written "guarantees" in the Paris Agreements cannot be trusted by the people of Europe for obvious reasons.

The Paris Agreements stipulate the revival of West German militarism and the establishment of a West German army, which is incompatible with the universal disarmament plan currently being studied by the United Nations. Ratification of the Paris Agreements would intensify the arms race and create new obstacles to reaching agreement on disarmament issues.

The Soviet government deems it necessary to reiterate that the French government's attitude of aiding the revival of German militarism clearly violates the Franco-Soviet Treaty signed in 1944, which aims to prevent the resurgence of German aggression, and completely undermines the role of this treaty. However, this treaty is no less important to France and French security than it is to the Soviet Union.

The French government's attitude is also incompatible with other international agreements in which France participates, such as the Potsdam Agreement, which stipulates the restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis and the elimination of the possibility of remilitarization of any part of Germany.

The Soviet government agrees with the view that, in order to hold a successful conference to discuss pressing European issues, including the German question, corresponding favorable conditions should be created for the relevant countries to reach an agreement. The European conference on safeguarding European peace and security, held in Moscow from November 29th to December 2nd, proves that the Soviet Union and other countries participating in the conference are striving to reach such an agreement in order to benefit the consolidation of European peace. On the other hand, the French government's refusal to participate in the all-European conference and the four-power conference on the German issue cannot prove that it has the same desire.

Some people are trying to portray things as if the ratification of the Paris Agreements does not prevent a solution to the German question through negotiations between the relevant countries. This statement does not correspond to the actual situation and can only mislead public opinion. This is a conspiracy currently being used by France and other countries to numb the vigilance of the people.

In fact, ratification of the Paris Agreements, which stipulate turning West Germany into a militarist country and making it join a military bloc against other European countries, would make four-power negotiations on the issue of German unification pointless and would preclude the possibility of reaching an agreement on this issue. Those who are working to ratify the Paris Agreements are those who are not committed to easing international tension but are instead trying to further exacerbate it.

In the current situation, when the direct threat of the revival of West German militarism has already arisen, it is particularly impermissible for countries to relax their vigilance against the danger of a new European war.

In response to the remilitarization of West Germany, and in response to the increasingly aggressive nature of the policies of France and the North Atlantic bloc countries that are with it, the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries will take all necessary measures to strengthen their armaments and safeguard their own security. The Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries are forced to take all necessary measures without delay in order to counter the growing armed forces of aggressive countries, which threaten peace, with equally powerful forces and with preparations for defense and the protection of peace. The aggressive plans of France and other countries in the North Atlantic bloc are intensifying the arms race. Therefore, they must bear full responsibility for the consequences of their current policies, which are incompatible with the interests of peace and are greatly deepening the danger of a new European war.

The declaration of the governments of the Soviet Union, the People'

### 就法、英、美拒绝参加全欧会议和四国会议  苏联政府复照法、英、美三国政府

    就法、英、美拒绝参加全欧会议和四国会议
    苏联政府复照法、英、美三国政府
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日电：报纸前已报道，法国、英国和美国三国政府在一九五四年十一月二十九日经由它们驻莫斯科大使馆把答复苏联政府一九五四年十月二十三日和十一月十三日两次照会的复照交给苏联政府。
    法国政府照会的全文已在苏联十二月二日的报纸上发表。
    十二月九日，苏联外交部把苏联政府的复照交给法国、英国和美国驻莫斯科大使馆。
    苏联政府给法国政府的照会的全文如下：
    苏联政府已经收到法国政府十一月二十九日交来的、答复苏联政府一九五四年十月二十三日和十一月十三日两次照会的复照。
    苏联政府遗憾地得知法国政府认为不能参加会议来和欧洲其他国家共同研究关于欧洲集体安全的问题。
    从法国政府的照会中可以看出，法国政府也不接受苏联政府提出的这一建议：举行法国、美国、英国和苏联四国外长会议，以便讨论关于恢复德国统一和举行全德自由选举的问题以及关于召开一次目的在建立欧洲集体安全体系的全欧会议。
    法国政府不仅拒绝参加全欧会议和拒绝研究苏联政府提出的关于欧洲集体安全体系的建议，而且自己又提不出关于保障欧洲集体安全的任何建议。大家都知道，法国政府和参加北大西洋集团的国家一起，阻挠欧洲其他国家参加这一会议。
    因此，法国政府的态度证明：法国政府不想和欧洲其他国家就如何巩固欧洲和平问题达成协议，并且阻挠建立有效的欧洲安全体系。
    法国政府不要建立有效的欧洲集体安全体系，而是千方百计地想要使巴黎协定得到批准，这个协定的目的，是使西德重新军国主义化，并且把西德拉进侵略性的北大西洋集团以及西方国家组成的、反对欧洲爱好和平国家的其他一些军事集团。这种政策将使西德变为军国主义国家，并且会产生一切危险的后果，不消说，西德重新军国主义化将使它不可能同爱好和平的德意志民主共和国合并成为一个统一的国家。
    无论在苏联，或是在法国和欧洲其他国家，西德军国主义的复活不能不使人对今后欧洲和平的命运感到焦虑。法国政府不会不知道，对德国军国主义的所谓“限制”和巴黎协定中所作的书面上的“保证”，由于显而易见的理由，是不能得到欧洲各国人民的信任的。
    巴黎协定规定复活西德军国主义和建立西德军队，这是和现在联合国正在研究的普遍裁军计划不相容的。批准巴黎协定就会使扩军运动加强，给裁军问题的达成协议造成新的障碍。
    苏联政府认为有必要重申：法国政府这种助长德国军国主义复活的态度，显然违反一九四四年签订的、目的在于阻止德国侵略再起的法苏条约，而且彻底破坏了这个条约的作用。但是，这个条约对法国和法国安全的意义，并不比对苏联小。
    法国政府的这种态度同其他一些有法国参加的国际协定，例如同规定在和平民主的基础上恢复德国统一、消除德国任何一部分重新军国主义化的可能性的波茨坦协定，也是不相容的。
    苏联政府同意这样一种看法：要开好讨论包括德国问题在内的一些迫切的欧洲问题的会议，应当为有关国家达成协议创造相应的有利条件。十一月二十九日到十二月二日在莫斯科举行的欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议证明：苏联和参加会议的其他国家在力求达成这种协议，以便有利于巩固欧洲和平。另一方面，法国政府拒绝参加全欧会议和讨论德国问题的四国会议，绝不能证明它也有着同样的愿望。
    有些人企图把事情说成这样：仿佛批准巴黎协定并不妨碍通过各有关国家之间的谈判来解决德国问题。这种说法不符合实际的情况，只能迷惑舆论。这是目前法国和其他国家用来麻痹人民的警惕性的阴谋。
    事实上，批准规定把西德变为军国主义国家和使西德加入反对欧洲其他国家的军事集团的巴黎协定，就会使四国关于统一德国问题的谈判成为没有目的的谈判，而且排斥了就这个问题达成协议的可能性。需要批准巴黎协定的是那些不致力于缓和国际紧张局势、反而力图进一步加剧这种紧张局势的人们。
    在当前的情况下，当复活西德军国主义的直接威胁已经发生的时候，各国对欧洲新战争的危险放松警惕，那是尤其不能允许的。
    为了回答西德的重新军国主义化，为了回答法国及同它一起的北大西洋集团国家的政策的侵略性质的日益加强，苏联和爱好和平的其他国家将采取一切必要的措施，来加强自己的武装和保障自身的安全。苏联和其他爱好和平的国家被迫刻不容缓地采取一切必要的措施，以便用同等强大的力量以及进行防御和保卫和平的准备，来对付侵略国家的日益增长的、威胁和平的武装力量。法国及北大西洋集团的其他国家的侵略计划，正在使军备竞赛日益加强。因此它们对它们的现行政策的后果要负全部责任，这种政策是同和平的利益毫不相容的，它正在使欧洲新战争的危险大大加深。
    十二月二日在莫斯科欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议上通过的苏联、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国八国政府的宣言，体现了苏联对巴黎协定的签订和目前欧洲局势所采取的立场。大家知道，参加了莫斯科会议的中华人民共和国政府表示完全同意和支持莫斯科会议的宣言。
    苏联政府将上述宣言的全文随同这次照会送给法国政府。
    至于奥地利问题，苏联政府在柏林四国会议上提出的建议以及后来有关的照会表明了苏联在这一问题上的立场。批准巴黎协定自然不能促进有关国家和奥地利就奥地利问题达成大家如此期待的协议。
    苏联政府同时送给英国和美国政府内容相同的照会。
    苏联政府照会中附有一九五四年十二月二日在莫斯科欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议上通过的苏联、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国八国政府的宣言。
