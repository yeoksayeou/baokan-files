    Agricultural Cooperative Members Produce and Sell More Grain
    The members of the ninety-four agricultural production cooperatives in the Third District of Kunyu County, Shandong Province, sold more than twice as much marketable grain this autumn as ordinary farmers. These agricultural production cooperatives account for 22.2% of the total population of the district and 21.9% of the total land area, but they sold more than 37% of the total grain sold in the district. On average, each cooperative member household sold 210 jin of surplus grain, while farmers outside the cooperative sold only 93 jin per household.
    These agricultural production cooperatives harvested more grain this autumn than farmers outside the cooperatives. This year's autumn grain harvest in the district increased by more than 10% compared to last year, while these agricultural production cooperatives increased production by 30% compared to last year. From last winter to this spring, agricultural production cooperatives throughout the district launched a large-scale production campaign, with members braving wind and snow to carry out tasks such as sand pressing, soil replacement, and fertilizer accumulation. The Song Zongguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhougezhuang pushed more than 10,000 cartloads of sand and pressed 55 mu of alkaline land. Alkaline land that had not been able to grow seedlings for many years grew robust crops this year, yielding more than 10,000 jin of grain. The Sun Mingzhu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beiqiao Village spent nearly 300 labor days opening up three mu of paddy fields in the mountain gully, harvesting 1,520 jin of rice, creating a local miracle.

    农业社社员打粮多卖粮多
    山东省昆嵛县第三区九十四个农业生产合作社的社员们，今年秋天平均比一般农户多卖了一倍多的商品粮。这些农业生产合作社的人口占全区总人口的百分之二十二点二，合作社的土地占总土地数量的百分之二十一点九，但他们卖的粮食，占全区总卖粮数的百分之三十七以上。合作社社员平均每户卖余粮二百一十斤，社外农民平均每户只卖九十三斤。
    这些农业生产合作社今年秋天比社外农民多打了粮食。全区今年的秋粮约比去年增产一成多，这些农业生产合作社比去年增产三成。去冬今春，全区农业生产合作社曾经掀起大生产运动，社员们冒着风雪进行了压沙、换土、积肥等工作。周格庄宋宗国农业生产合作社推了一万多车沙，压了五十五亩碱地。多年不“纳”苗的碱地，今年长起茁壮的庄稼，多收了一万多斤粮食。北桥村孙明竹农业生产合作社花了近三百个劳动日，在山沟里开出三亩水田，收了一千五百二十斤水稻，创造了当地的奇迹。　（杜永进）
