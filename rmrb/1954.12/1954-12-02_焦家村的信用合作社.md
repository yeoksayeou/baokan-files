    Jiao Family Village's Credit Cooperative
    By Our Correspondent Li Gendi
    The masses of Jiao Family Village in the Sanqiao District of Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, have established a credit cooperative (hereinafter referred to as the credit cooperative). Everyone likes it very much, calling it a "small bank." Every evening, people go to the credit cooperative to deposit, withdraw, or borrow money.

    The Jiao Family Village Credit Cooperative was established in January 1953. At that time, the peasants had only recently been emancipated, and many families still had very meager resources, facing difficulties in both production and daily life. Although the People's Government had solved many problems through relief efforts, agricultural loans, and mobilizing peasants to form mutual aid teams, it was still not enough. After the credit cooperative was established, it immediately set about helping the masses solve their immediate livelihood difficulties, providing loans to members who suffered unexpected disasters such as illness or death, so that they would not fall into the trap of high-interest loan exploitation again. In February and March of last year, the credit cooperative lent 28 shi of grain deposited by members to grain-deficient households, helping them get through the difficult period before the new harvest. It also used loans to maintain the village's sideline production, solving the problem of insufficient funds for members to raise pigs, make tofu, and sew shoes.

    The credit cooperative focused its main efforts on supporting agricultural production. Last spring, when the cooperative was first established, funds were limited, and it only loaned money for chemical fertilizers and small agricultural tools. By autumn, the funds had expanded. At that time, wheat fields were in need of base fertilizer, and the credit cooperative immediately issued loans of 18,000 jin of oil cake. This year, it loaned more than 16 million yuan for wheat field topdressing fertilizer. This year's bumper wheat harvest in the village owes a debt to the credit cooperative. This year, in preparation for the summer harvest, the credit cooperative loaned more than 9.5 million yuan for livestock, helping six mutual aid teams in the village buy livestock, reducing the difficulties of the summer harvest. It also issued loans for the repair of major agricultural tools such as carts and waterwheels. This year, from January to September, the credit cooperative's loans for agricultural production totaled 37 million yuan, approximately 80% of the total amount of loans made by the state bank to Jiao Family Village from liberation to 1952. Due to the credit cooperative's active support for agricultural production, the production situation in Jiao Family Village has greatly changed. The amount of oil cake purchased by the village each season has more than doubled compared to the past, and the number of livestock has also increased. Last year, Jiao Family Village was named a high-yield wheat village in the county. This year, not only was there a bumper wheat harvest in the village, but cotton production also increased.

    The credit cooperative's loans to farmers are mostly for urgent and quick-yielding purposes, leaving a deep impression on the masses. Last spring, Jiao Weiping's family was short of grain and almost ran out of food. Jiao Weiping and his brothers were so worried they didn't know what to do and wanted to sell their livestock to buy grain. Just then, the credit cooperative was established. He borrowed grain and 450,000 yuan for sideline production from the credit cooperative, which not only solved the problem of livelihood, but also did not delay production. Before the summer harvest this year, his family's mule died. The death of a mule is a major setback for farmers, but he borrowed another 500,000 yuan from the credit cooperative and added 300,000 yuan of his own to buy a cow. He said with emotion: "The credit cooperative is my golden pot. When I'm in trouble, it comes to help." Villagers discussed: Fortunately, there is a credit cooperative. If we had to rely on high-interest loans, even ten Jiao Weipings would never be able to recover. Before liberation, farmhand Yang Zhenhai was forced by high-interest loans to lose his land and become a vagrant. When the land reform began, everyone doubted that he could still work. Now he has land, has joined a mutual aid team, and also receives support from the credit cooperative. Whenever he spreads the chemical fertilizer he bought with the loan on the ground, he always goes to look at it a few times, and also picks up the soil and puts it on the tip of his tongue to taste the fertilizer. He tells everyone that the credit cooperative is good.

    Through practical education in various aspects, the peasants of Jiao Family Village understand the benefits of credit cooperation. In addition, deposits earn interest, so many people use the action of more shares and more deposits to support and consolidate their credit cooperative. Now, out of 127 households in the village, excluding six landlord households, 117 households have joined the cooperative, with an average of about two members per household. When the credit cooperative was first established, some members held a tentative attitude and did not dare to deposit much, fearing that it would be difficult to withdraw. At that time, it only received 2 million yuan in deposits per month, of which fixed deposits accounted for only one-tenth. However, after the deposit and loan business was launched, the credit cooperative's credibility quickly rose. Last year, the average monthly deposit reached 4.23 million yuan. This year's business is even bigger than last year's. From January to September, the average monthly deposit was 12.25 million yuan, about 290% of last year's monthly deposit, basically achieving the goal of no idle money in the hands of farmers. In the past, there were five or six farmers in Jiao Family Village who occasionally lent money. After the establishment of the credit cooperative, everyone dealt with the credit cooperative, and no one borrowed money from them anymore. They also deposited their surplus money into the credit cooperative, one of whom has increased his deposit from 500,000 yuan to more than 5 million yuan.

    The masses of Jiao Family Village often say that their credit cooperative is a bridge to socialism. In the past, the credit cooperative helped mutual aid teams and independent farmers. This year, in September, when the village just established an agricultural production cooperative, the credit cooperative did it a great favor by loaning it 20,000 jin of oil cake at once, basically solving the fertilizer problem for the agricultural production cooperative's winter wheat planting. In the future, with the development of the credit cooperative, it will give mutual aid and cooperation organizations and self-cultivating farmers even greater help.

### 焦家村的信用合作社

    焦家村的信用合作社
    本报记者　李根蒂
    陕西省长安县三桥区焦家村群众办了个信用合作社（以下简称信用社），大家全很喜欢它，叫它“小银行”。一到傍晚时分，就有人去信用社存款、取款或借钱。
    焦家村信用合作社是一九五三年一月成立的。那时农民翻身不久，有不少人家的家底子还很薄，生产和生活都有困难。人民政府通过救济、农业贷款和发动农民互助等虽是解决了不少困难，但还是不足。信用社成立后，立即着手帮助群众解决眼前的生活困难，贷款给有疾病、死亡等受到意外灾难的社员，使他们不致再掉进遭受高利贷剥削的陷坑里去。去年二、三月间，信用社把社员存入的二十八市石粮食贷放给缺粮户，帮助他们度过了青黄不接的难关，又用贷款维持了本村的副业生产，解决了社员养猪、做豆腐、绱鞋等资金不足的困难。
    信用社把主要的力量还是放在扶助农业生产方面。去年春上，社刚成立，资金少，只贷了些化学肥料和小型农具的款子。到秋季，资金就扩大了。当时麦田正需要上底肥，信用社马上放出一万八千斤油渣的贷款；今年又贷放了一千六百多万元的麦地追肥款。今年全村麦子丰收，信用社也有一份功劳。今年准备夏收期间，信用社贷出牲畜款九百五十多万元，帮助村里六个互助组买到牲口，减少了夏收的困难；还放出修理大车、水车等主要农具的贷款。今年从一月到九月，信用社用在农业生产方面的贷款共有三千七百万元，约等于解放后到一九五二年国家银行给焦家村贷款总数的百分之八十。由于信用社对农业生产的积极扶持，使焦家村的生产状况有了很大的改变；村里每季购进的油渣量比过去增加了一倍以上，牲口也增多了。去年焦家村被评为全县的小麦丰产村。今年全村不光麦子丰产，棉花产量也提高了。
    信用社给农民的贷款多半是用途急、见效快的，给群众留下了深刻的印象。去年春上，焦维平家缺粮，几乎断了灶火，焦维平弟兄们急得没主意，想卖掉牲口籴粮吃。正在这时信用社成立了，他由信用社贷到粮食和四十五万元的副业款，既解决了生活困难，又没荒废生产。今年夏收前，他家死去了骡子，庄稼人死条骡子是跌大跤的事，但他又由信用社贷到五十万元，自己再凑上三十万元买回了一头牛。他感动地说：“信用社就是我的金盆盆，受难的时候，它就来帮忙。”村里人议论：幸亏有个信用社，若是靠借高利贷，即使有十个焦维平也会跌得八辈子翻不起身。雇农杨振海在解放前被高利贷逼得失去了土地，成了游民，土地改革开始时，大家还怀疑他不会劳动了。现在他有了地，参加了互助组，还得到信用社的扶持。每当他把信贷款买来的化学肥料撒到地里后，总要去看几回，还抓起土来放在舌尖上尝尝肥劲，逢人就说信用社好。
    经过各方面的实际教育，焦家村农民懂得了信用合作的好处，加上存款还有利息，很多人就用多入股、多存款的行动来支持和巩固自己的信用社。现在，全村一百二十七户人家，除掉六户地主，已有一百一十七户入了社，平均每家约有两个社员。信用社初成立时，有些社员抱着试探的态度，不敢多存款，怕好存不好取。那时一个月只收到二百万元的存款，其中定期存款只占十分之一。可是存放款业务开展以后，信用社的信用很快就上升了，去年每月平均存款达到四百二十三万元。今年的业务比去年更大了，从一月到九月每月平均存进
  一千二百二十五万元，约为去年每月存款数的百分之二百九十，基本上达到了农民手中不存闲钱。焦家村以前也有五、六户农民不时地放点债，信用社成立后大家都和信用社打交道，没有人再向他们借钱，他们也就把余钱存进信用社里来了，其中有一户已由五十万元续存到五百多万元。
    焦家村的群众常说他们的信用社是向社会主义走去的一道桥梁。过去信用社帮助了互助组和自耕农民，今年九月村里刚成立农业生产合作社，信用社就帮了它一个大忙：一次贷给它两万斤油渣的款，基本上把农业生产合作社种冬麦的肥料解决了。今后随着信用社的发展，它还会给互助合作组织和自耕农民以更大的帮助。
