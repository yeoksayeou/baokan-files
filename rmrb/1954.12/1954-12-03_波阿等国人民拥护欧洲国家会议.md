Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd dispatch from Warsaw via Polish News Agency: Polish newspapers have for several days consecutively published articles and interviews from prominent figures from all walks of life, expressing support for the European Nations Conference to discuss guaranteeing peace and security in Europe.

    Professor Matysiak, Dean of the Sogo Te Economic Institute, said: Although the governments of some countries, under the direction of arms dealers and troublemakers, did not participate in the European Conference proposed by the Soviet Union, the people of all countries demand peace and security in Europe.
    Father Owczarek of Warsaw recounted his experience of living in a German Nazi concentration camp for five years. He said: These bloodsuckers are now trying to disguise themselves, but their slogans cannot deceive anyone. The dangerous situation prepared for the people by the dark forces must be reversed.
    Famous sculptor Dunikowski, who participated in the First World War and was imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Second World War, said: He therefore knew what losses the French nation suffered in the war, and believed that mankind would always remember the price of peace and friendship. He is convinced that the French people will never agree to the insidious agreement that stipulates the rearmament of West Germany.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 1st dispatch from Warsaw via Polish News Agency: The Polish "People's Tribune" published an article commenting on the importance of the European Conference, saying: Those who attempt to revive the Nazi Wehrmacht are trying desperately to belittle the importance of the Moscow Conference, but as the conference progresses, the significant role of the conference in safeguarding peace and security in Europe and the world is becoming increasingly apparent.
    The article said: The propaganda machine of Adenauer's main protectors can no longer conceal its unease: The "New York Times" editorial at the opening of the conference clamored with genuine Atlantic hysteria to quickly approve and implement the Paris Agreement.
    The article also said: Some gentlemen in the West think they can create collective death again in Europe, but they have forgotten two "small" facts: all countries have not forgotten the horrors of war; after the Soviet Union defeated Nazi Germany and the emergence of the German Democratic Republic and People's China with a population of 600 million, the balance of power in the world and Europe has greatly changed.
    The article reviewed the fact that Western countries used the Locarno Treaty in 1925 to open Poland's borders to German militarists in order to encourage them to advance eastward. However, the reporter said that such days are gone forever. The Moscow Conference is the best proof. Every patriotic Pole believes that this conference is a source of pride, inspiration and confidence in the future.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 1st dispatch from Tirana via Albanian News Agency: The Albanian National Peace Committee sent a telegram to congratulate the European Nations Conference on guaranteeing peace and security in Europe, and expressed hope that the conference would achieve success.
    The telegram said: "The entire Albanian people sincerely thank the Soviet government for its persistent efforts for peace, security and easing international tensions, and thank the Soviet government for initiating this conference that leads to reconciliation and close cooperation among European countries."
    The telegram pointed out: The London and Paris Agreements, which approve the rearmament of West Germany, will keep Germany in a permanent state of division, complicate the resolution of outstanding issues, and open the road to a new war. The telegram said: "Therefore, the peace-loving people of Albania place high hopes on the European Conference being held in Moscow, and they firmly believe that the conference will help establish a European collective security system."
    Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, December 1st: The Danish Parliament will soon discuss the issue of ratifying the Paris Agreement, and the Danish people are launching a widespread movement against the Paris Agreement.
    "Land and People's Daily" published an open letter to the Danish people issued by a group of prominent trade union leaders and cultural leaders. The open letter pointed out that the government and the parliament have so far received more than 150,000 letters of protest.
    The open letter said: All those who oppose the revival of German militarism and fascism have a responsibility to stand up against this ratification when the parliament is about to discuss the ratification of the Paris Agreement. The open letter called for December 7th to be designated as a "Day of Protest" against German remilitarization, and suggested that new letters of protest be submitted to the parliament on this day.

    波阿等国人民拥护欧洲国家会议
    【新华社二日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：波兰报纸接连几天刊登了各界著名人士的文章和谈话，拥护讨论保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家会议。
    索戈特经济学院教务长马蒂西克教授说：虽然有些国家的政府在军火商和动乱制造者的指使下没有参加苏联建议的欧洲会议，但是所有国家的人民都要求欧洲的和平和安全。
    华沙的奥夫查列克神父叙述了他身受五年德国纳粹集中营生活的情况。他说：这些喝血者今天正企图伪装自己，但是他们的口号是欺骗不了什么人的。必须扭转黑暗势力给人民准备的危险局面。
    名雕刻家杜尼科夫斯基曾经参加过第一次世界大战，并曾在第二次世界大战期间被关禁在奥斯威辛集中营中。他说：他因此知道了法兰西民族在战争中受到了怎样的损失，并认为人类将永远记得和平和友爱的代价。他深信法国人民永远不会同意规定重新武装西德的诡谲的协定。
    【新华社二日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙一日讯：波兰“人民论坛报”发表文章评论欧洲会议的重要意义说：企图复活纳粹国防军的人们拚命想贬低莫斯科会议的重要意义，但是随着会议的进展，会议在保障欧洲和世界和平和安全方面的重大作用是越来越明显了。
    文章说：阿登纳的主要保护人的宣传机关已经不能再掩饰自己的不安：“纽约时报”在会议开幕时的社论就以真正的大西洋式的歇斯底里叫嚣着快点批准并实施巴黎协定。
    文章又说：西方的某些绅士们以为他们能够在欧洲再度制造集体死亡，但是，他们忘记了两个“小小的”事实：所有国家并没有忘记战争惨祸；在苏联击溃纳粹德国以及世界上出现了德意志民主共和国和有着六亿人口的人民中国以后，世界和欧洲的力量对比已经有了大大的变化。
    文章回顾了西方国家曾经在一九二五年用洛迦诺条约把波兰的边境开放给德国军国主义者以鼓励他们东进的事实。但是，记者说，这种日子已经一去不复返了。莫斯科会议就是最好的证明。每个爱国的波兰人都认为：这一次会议是骄傲、鼓舞和对未来的信念的源泉。
    【新华社二日讯】据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社地拉那一日讯：阿尔巴尼亚全国和平委员会电贺保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家会议，并希望会议获致成就。
    电文说：“阿尔巴尼亚全体人民衷心感谢苏联政府为和平、安全和缓和国际紧张局势的坚持努力，感谢苏联政府倡议召开这个通向欧洲国家修好和紧密合作道路的会议。”
    电文指出：批准重新武装西德的伦敦和巴黎协定将使德国永久处于分裂状态，使得悬而未决问题的解决复杂起来，并且打开新战争的道路。电文说：“因此，阿尔巴尼亚爱好和平的人民对正在莫斯科举行的欧洲会议寄予厚望，他们坚信：会议将有助于建立欧洲集体安全体系。”
    【新华社一日讯】哥本哈根消息：丹麦下议院不久将讨论批准巴黎协定的问题，丹麦人民正在展开广泛的反对巴黎协定的运动。
    “国土与人民报”刊载了由一批著名工会领袖和文化界领袖发出的一篇告丹麦人民书。告人民书指出，到目前为止，政府和下议院已经收到了十五万份以上的抗议书。
    告人民书说：一切反对德国军国主义和法西斯主义复活的人们有责任在下议院即将讨论批准巴黎协定的时候起来反对这种批准。告人民书要求把十二月七日规定为反对德国重新军国主义化的“抗议日”，并且建议在这一天向下议院提出新的抗议书。
