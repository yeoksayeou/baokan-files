    To all commanders and combatants of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    In the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, together with the heroic Korean People's Army, defeated the invading army headed by U.S. imperialism, achieved the great victory of the Korean Armistice, defended the security of the motherland, and opened the way for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, the U.S. aggressive bloc and its followers have continuously obstructed and undermined the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement; recently, the United States has again manipulated the United Nations General Assembly to pass an unreasonable proposal of fifteen aggressive countries, refusing to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. You are guarding the peace of Korea day and night on the front line. If the enemy dares to carry out armed provocations again, they will surely suffer your resolute counterattack!
    The U.S. aggressive bloc refuses to accept the lessons of its aggression against Korea, and openly signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to permanently occupy our country's Taiwan, threaten the security of the motherland, and undermine peace in Asia. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the motherland are more strongly united, working harder, and learning from your high patriotism and heroic fighting spirit, to fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan, the defense of the motherland, and the defense of peace.
    Our plenary session expresses deep concern for you, and hereby extends our highest respect and warm greetings!
    The First Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
    December 25, 1954, in Beijing

    致中国人民志愿军的慰问电中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员同志们：
    中国人民志愿军在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中，同英雄的朝鲜人民军一道，击败了以美帝国主义为首的侵略军，取得了朝鲜停战的伟大胜利，保卫了祖国的安全，并为朝鲜问题的和平解决开辟了道路。但是，美国侵略集团及其追随者，不断地阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战协定的实施；最近，美国又操纵联合国大会，通过十五个侵略国家的无理提案，拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题。你们日日夜夜地在前线保卫着朝鲜的和平，如果敌人敢于再进行武装挑衅，必将遭受你们坚决的回击！
    美国侵略集团不肯接受侵略朝鲜的教训，公然同蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”，企图永久霸占我国的台湾，威胁祖国安全，破坏亚洲和平。祖国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，更坚强团结，加紧工作，学习你们的高度爱国主义和英勇战斗的精神，为解放台湾、保卫祖国、保卫和平而奋斗到底。
    我们全体会议对你们深切关怀，谨向你们致崇高的敬意和热烈的慰问！
    中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议
    一九五四年十二月二十五日于北京
