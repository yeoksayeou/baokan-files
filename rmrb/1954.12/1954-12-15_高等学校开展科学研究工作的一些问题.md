    Some Problems in Developing Scientific Research in Universities and Colleges
    He Zuoxiu
    It is of great significance to carry out scientific research in universities and colleges. This article intends to put forward some opinions on the following five issues, hoping to receive corrections.
      What is Scientific Research Work
    What is scientific research work? This question has been discussed in many universities and colleges. Some people believe that scientific research by university teachers can only be specialized research, while material surveys, summaries of production experience, etc., cannot be called scientific research. Others believe that the scope of scientific research should not be too narrow, and that teachers' professional development, lesson preparation, translation of teaching materials, and popular science work can all be regarded as scientific research. The most debated issue is whether writing textbooks counts as scientific research work, with some people thinking it does and others thinking it doesn't.
    To solve this problem, we must first clearly recognize that scientific research is a creative work. The task of scientific research is to continuously enrich and develop people's understanding of the laws of nature and society, and to use them to transform nature and society. That is to say, scientific research is for clarifying or deepening scientific principles in a certain aspect, recording natural phenomena that have not been noticed in a certain aspect, solving a new technical problem, organizing a certain science to make it systematic, etc., rather than just repeating the results that others have already obtained and understanding the conclusions that others have already reached.
    At the same time, we must also see that in conducting scientific research on any topic, a series of steps and various research methods are often adopted. This includes studying and analyzing existing literature, observing and recording natural phenomena, investigating and collecting socio-economic data, summarizing and organizing production experience, criticizing and developing old theories, conducting various experiments and tests, until writing papers for publication; some also require holding scientific seminars, etc., to assist in the progress of research work. Obviously, we cannot just call a certain stage of creative activity scientific research work and exclude other large amounts of labor. Therefore, when judging whether a certain work counts as scientific research, it is often necessary to see whether this work is part of the entire scientific research. For example, repeating experiments that others have already done, if it is only for demonstration in teaching, then of course it cannot be called scientific research work; but if the purpose is to test whether other people's experiments are correct, or to gain experience from here to further propose or solve new scientific problems, then this work can also be regarded as part of the entire scientific research work. The writing of textbooks and monographs is often a summary of the highly developed state of a certain science. In this work, in addition to collecting a large amount of material, it is also necessary to digest and improve these materials and form a system. Therefore, this work should be regarded as scientific research. Especially when this science has not yet formed a system or there are no mature textbooks, this work is more scientific in nature. Of course, in the compilation of some textbooks, only the research results of others are synthesized, and there are no creative achievements, nor can it reflect and summarize the state of this science, so this work cannot be called scientific research work.
    The Tasks of Scientific Research Work in Universities and Colleges, and the Relationship between Teaching and Research
    The basic tasks of scientific research work in universities and colleges should include two aspects: improving teaching quality and developing China's science and culture to promote national construction in all aspects. The dual tasks of scientific research work in universities and colleges are determined by the characteristics of universities and colleges and their basic tasks. The basic task of universities and colleges is to train construction cadres for the country, and scientific research work naturally has an important aspect of improving teaching quality. At the same time, universities and colleges concentrate a very large number of scientific research personnel, far more than the existing scientific research institutions, and have certain conditions for conducting scientific research, such as books and experimental equipment. If this part of the strength is correctly utilized, it will greatly help improve China's scientific and cultural level and promote the development of national construction in all aspects.
    In universities and colleges, teaching and conducting scientific research are closely integrated. The students trained by universities and colleges cannot just be people who chew on ready-made knowledge from books. This requires university teachers to truly and deeply grasp modern science and be good at teaching students with a creative attitude towards science. However, profound scientific knowledge and the ability to deal with and solve various scientific problems can never be obtained only by reciting the words in books; if a teacher does not have scientific practice (i.e., conducting scientific research), then it will be difficult for him to gain experience in proposing and solving scientific problems and the ability to conduct theoretical analysis, and he will not be able to understand various scientific problems more deeply. In fact, in the teaching practice of teachers, some scientific problems are often raised, prompting teachers to conduct research; the results of teachers' scientific research often enrich the content of teaching in turn.
    However, there are also differences between scientific research work and teaching. The main task of teaching work is to impart ready-made knowledge, while scientific research is to solve new scientific problems; the scope involved in teaching work is always relatively broad, and the object involved in scientific research work is always relatively deep. Even in more specialized courses, this difference still exists. Many different problems may be raised in the teaching process, but scientific research often can only choose one of them for in-depth exploration. If teachers are required to solve all the problems raised in teaching in scientific research at once, it will make scientific research work impossible. Generally speaking, the topics of scientific research conducted by teachers should be the most important problems that occur in teaching, so that breaking through one point can achieve the goal of comprehensively improving the level of teaching. However, sometimes although the problems arising in teaching are important, they are not suitable for the teacher to use as his scientific research topic. He chooses other scientific research topics that are less directly related to the current teaching content according to his specific conditions. This situation is also permissible, and it cannot be considered that scientific research work is divorced from teaching. Because as long as the teacher conducts this scientific research seriously and achieves something, it will ultimately help improve his teaching level. Moreover, the improvement of a teacher's scientific level cannot be limited to the study of a scientific department currently taught. In special circumstances (either due to the special needs of the country, or because the teacher has special expertise in a certain aspect), it may also be necessary for the teacher to study problems in other disciplines other than the courses taught.
    Formulating Scientific Research Plans and Combining Science and Production
    Correctly formulating a plan is one of the most important links in organizing scientific research work. Some people believe that scientific research is to explore unknown laws, and therefore it is impossible to formulate a plan. This view is wrong. The development of science has certain laws. In every era, every science always adapts to the needs of production, develops under the influence of other sciences, and follows certain clues and directions based on the large amount of work of predecessors. Scientific research cannot be regarded as blind groping, only reaching new achievements due to accidental opportunities.
    The research plan must first correctly implement the policy of "strengthening the combination of science and production." But the forms of this combination are diverse. Production often raises unanswered questions in front of science, requiring creative scientific research to solve them; in order to solve some general and general problems raised in production, it is necessary to use the strength of many scientific workers to conduct many experiments and theoretical analysis. Sometimes, problems related to the entire national economy, rather than limited to the scope of one science, are also raised in front of scientific workers, such as the study of the development of the Yellow River region in China. The above situations are all directly related to science and production. In addition, there is another type of combination, that is, this type of science often needs to go through a whole series of links to be related to production. Therefore, when formulating scientific research work plans, neither should we neglect the study of those important scientific problems that are directly related to current practical work, nor should we abandon the study of basic theoretical problems.
    Since the combination of science and production has many forms, if we want to closely combine scientific research work with the requirements of national construction, we must start from the overall situation of national construction and weigh the importance and urgency of various scientific problems. For this reason, as many people have proposed, it is necessary to strengthen the unified planning and unified leadership of scientific research. This should naturally be the responsibility of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education. However, it is impossible for the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Higher Education to be able to formulate national scientific research plans for various scientific departments in a short period of time. Moreover, even if this national scientific research plan is formulated, it can only guarantee the progress of certain essential scientific work, and it is impossible to stipulate all research topics in detail for nearly two hundred universities across the country, as some people have imagined. It is very necessary to fully mobilize the initiative of scientists in scientific work. Under the current conditions, in addition to those urgent tasks directly proposed by the state, the research plans of universities and colleges should be based on the problems actively proposed by researchers according to national needs and expertise, and appropriately adjusted with reference to useful suggestions from all parties. We cannot sit and wait for the formulation of a national research plan. Under this circumstance, the determination of scientific research plans is inevitably still subject to some shortcomings. We should gradually overcome these shortcomings, and we should seek gradual improvement on the basis of striving to widely carry out research work, rather than put forward excessive demands and form various restrictions when scientific work has just begun.
    It is necessary to correctly carry out debates on different opinions and academic criticism
    Whether in universities and colleges or in any scientific research institution, carrying out criticism and discussion has always been the fundamental method of developing science. Because in scientific research work, people are often led to wrong understandings due to one-sided understanding, limitations in the degree of exposure of objective phenomena, and the influence of class prejudices. Conducting criticism and discussion can help us overcome mistakes and point out the way forward.
    However, some people believe that criticism should not be carried out at present. They believe that the prerequisite for carrying out criticism is that China's science must have a relatively high level, otherwise if there are different opinions, no one will be able to draw conclusions. This view is wrong. It is precisely because our scientific level is not high that we need to carry out criticism and discussion to help us continuously improve our scientific level; it is precisely because there are different opinions on scientific issues that it is more necessary to carry out debates on these different opinions, so that the focus of the debate is clearer and it is easier to reach a conclusion. The history of scientific development proves that the solution of many fundamental scientific problems is often the result of long-term debates.
    Currently, there is still a lack of a culture of criticism and discussion in China's academic circles. On the one hand, some people are afraid that the unfolding of criticism will affect unity, so they often replace the principle of seeking truth in science with mutual praise, or everyone puts different opinions in their hearts, and the surface is harmonious, but in reality, they still retain the old-fashioned habit of "scholars despise each other." But on the other hand, there have also been simplistic and crude criticisms, which have caused others to misunderstand the purpose of conducting academic criticism and fear criticism.
    We should not treat scientific research with shortcomings with a rude attitude, nor should we treat criticism with shortcomings with a rude attitude. Critics should be required to be absolutely correct in the facts they criticize, and should not distort the original meaning of the author; critics should be required to take a cautious and responsible attitude, and to give full consideration and research when pointing out other people's mistakes; but if critics are required to be absolutely correct in their views and judgments, then there will be no criticism. When a scientific issue has not yet reached a recognized correct conclusion, there are always different opinions on science. It is very necessary to cause disputes over different opinions in science, because only in this way can everyone gain improvement and find the correct conclusion. Therefore, in addition to being good at criticizing others, we should also be good at treating other people's criticisms.
    A common way to conduct criticism and discussion is to hold discussions of different sizes to discuss a scientific paper, a book, or a scientific issue, a scientific theory, and critically analyze the state of scientific research in a certain discipline. Scientific seminars have been implemented in some schools. Although some seminars have been held in vain because of the lack of preparation in advance, with only a few people making reports and failing to arouse discussion, seriously held scientific seminars can always achieve certain results, especially promoting the common cooperation of scholars in different scientific fields.
    Actively Overcoming Various Difficulties and Obstacles and Developing Scientific Research Step by Step
    One of our important tasks at present is to strive to develop scientific research work. Of course, there are still many difficulties and obstacles to carrying out scientific research. First of all, in terms of ideology, for example, some school leaders are afraid that the development of scientific research will hinder teaching, some scholars are afraid of being labeled as "pursuing personal fame and gain" for conducting scientific research, and many teachers are troubled by the difficulty in determining research directions and do not know how to combine with reality and teaching. In addition to these ideological issues that should be unified in understanding, some difficulties in working conditions should also be resolved.
    The first is the issue of time. Now schools often feel that they do not have time to conduct research, which has two aspects. On the one hand, the work of some schools has not been completely institutionalized, and there are too many non-teaching activities in schools, and some teaching activities are not carried out as appropriately as possible. On the other hand, many teachers are not good at planning their work. Therefore, the time issue must be resolved from two aspects. On the one hand, the administrative system should be further improved, and on the other hand, teachers also need to be good at seizing every bit of time. Leningrad University President Alexandrov said it well: "A person who truly loves science will not have time to conduct research, just as a person in love will not be unable to find time to meet with his lover." We have seen that many old teachers are very busy on the one hand, but are still conducting research on the other.
    Another difficulty is the lack of books and instruments. It is wrong to overemphasize the difficulties caused by the lack of books and equipment. Many outstanding works in the history of science have often been carried out under difficult conditions. After the Chinese Academy of Sciences delegation to the Soviet Union returned to China last year, they also told us that the Soviet Union pays great attention to giving full play to the potential capabilities of housing, books, and equipment. But it must also be admitted that without the minimum books and equipment, it is difficult to conduct research. In this regard, our conditions are still quite poor, especially the lack of books is more serious. China currently does not have complete scientific literature from the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and the literature from capitalist countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States is also mostly incomplete. The supply of new books by book publishing institutions is also not satisfactory, and the supply of foreign books and periodicals is often insufficient. Some libraries have not given due attention to taking care of the needs of scientific research. In the translation of scientific books, the translation of textbooks has now attracted attention and has made some achievements (of course, this is still not enough); however, less attention has been paid to the translation of scientific monographs and classic works related to research work and sufficient to train scientific cadres. Because China's science is still very backward, and it is urgent to absorb the scientific achievements of the Soviet Union and other countries to enrich and develop China's scientific work, the supply of books and magazines should be regarded as an extremely important issue. It is hoped that relevant parties will strengthen and improve this work.
    There are also some problems in the purchase and use of instruments and equipment. On the one hand, we do not have our own strong instrument and reagent industry, so that some instruments have to rely on foreign orders; but on the other hand, because the equipment needed for scientific research work is mostly of many types and small quantities, it has caused some difficulties in foreign trade. Someone once proposed establishing a company that operates scientific equipment. This suggestion is worth paying attention to by relevant parties.
    There are also some other difficulties in carrying out scientific research work, but for all these difficulties, we should be good at conducting specific analysis and overcome them separately. Taking the time issue as an example, it must be specifically analyzed whether all the teachers do not have time, or only a few teaching and research offices or a few teachers do not have time. Taking the point of insufficient books and instruments as another example, is it that we are very short of books and instruments in all aspects, or is it only that there is a shortage of books and instruments in a certain aspect or a certain type. In order to carry out scientific research work, we must be good at distinguishing the characteristics of various sciences and distinguishing various different conditions. To specifically solve the problems of combining theory with practice, combining research with teaching, etc., to determine the steps for carrying out research in each teaching and research office, to formulate the research plans of teaching and research offices and individuals, etc., it is necessary to consider the characteristics of various sciences and various different conditions. We should gradually carry out scientific research work in universities and colleges separately and step by step according to these different situations, conditions, and characteristics.

    高等学校开展科学研究工作的一些问题
    何祚庥
    在高等学校中，开展科学研究工作有很重要的意义。本文拟就下列五个问题提出若干意见，希望得到指正。
      什么是科学研究工作
    什么是科学研究工作，在相当多的高等学校里曾对这一问题进行了讨论。有些人认为，高等学校教师的科学研究只能是专题研究，而材料的调查、生产经验的总结等等，都不能叫做科学研究；有些人则认为，科学研究的范围不应太狭，教师的业务进修、备课、教学资料的翻译以及科学普及工作等等都可算作科学研究。争论最多的，是关于编写教科书算不算科学研究工作，有些人认为是，有些人认为不是。
    要解决这个问题，我们首先必须明确认识科学研究是一种创造性的工作。科学研究的任务在于不断地丰富和发展人们对于自然和社会规律性的了解，并用来改造自然和改造社会。也就是说，科学研究是为了阐明或加深某一方面的科学原理，记载某一方面尚未被人察知的自然现象，解决某一新的技术课题，整理某一门科学使它体系化等等，而不是只重复一下别人已经得到的结果，了解别人已经得到的结论。
    同时，我们还要看到，在进行任何题目的科学研究时，常常要采用一系列的步骤和多种的研究方式。这里包括着旧有文献资料的钻研和分析，自然现象的观察和记录，社会经济资料的调查和收集，生产经验的总结和整理，旧有理论的批判和发挥，进行各种的实验和试验等等，直到写成论文发表；有的还须举行科学讨论会等等来辅助研究工作的进行。显然我们不能只是把创造活动的某一段落叫做科学研究工作，而把其他大量劳动不算在内。因此，判断某一项工作算不算科学研究时，往往还需要看这项工作是不是整个科学研究的一个部分。举例说，重复别人所已做的实验，如果只是为了在教学中示范，那当然不能叫做科学研究工作；但如果目的是为了检验别人的试验是否正确，或者为了从这里取得经验，来进一步提出或解决新的科学问题，那么这种工作也可以作为整个科学研究工作中的一部分。教科书和专著的编写常常是某一门科学高度发展的总结，在这种工作中，除了要搜集大量材料外，还需要将这些材料加以消化、提高并形成体系。因此，这种工作应算作科学研究。特别是当这门科学尚未形成体系或还没有成熟的教科书时，这种工作就更带有科学研究的性质。当然，在有些教科书的编纂中，只是将别人研究结果综合一下，既无创造性的成果在内，也不能反映和概括这门科学状况，因而这种工作也就不能叫做科学研究工作。
    高等学校科学研究工作的任务以及教学和研究的关系
    高等学校科学研究工作的基本任务应该包括两个方面：提高教学质量和发展我国科学、文化以促进国家各方面的建设。高等学校科学研究工作的双重任务是由高等学校的特性和高等学校的基本任务所决定的。高等学校的基本任务是为国家培养建设干部，科学研究工作也就当然有一个重要的方面是为了提高教学质量。同时高等学校集中了数量极大、远较现有科学研究机关多出很多的科学研究人员，并拥有一定的图书、实验设备等等进行科学研究的条件，这一部分力量如果加以正确地发挥，将会对提高我国科学和文化水平，对促进国家各方面建设事业的发展有很大的帮助。
    在高等学校中教学和进行科学研究是密切结合的。高等学校所培养出来的学生，不能只是咀嚼书本上现成知识的人。这就要求高等学校的教师能够真正深刻掌握现代科学，并善于以创造性的对待科学的态度来教导学生。可是，深刻的科学知识，处理和解决各种科学问题的能力决不能只是由背诵书本上字句而得到；一个教师如果没有科学的实践（即进行科学研究），那他就很难获得提出、解决科学问题的经验和进行理论分析的能力，也就不能更深刻地理解各种科学问题。事实上，在教师的教学实践过程中，常会提出一些科学问题，推动教师去进行研究；教师进行科学研究的结果也常常反过来丰富了教学的内容。
    但另外，科学研究工作和教学之间也还有着区别。教学工作的主要任务是传授现成的知识，科学研究则在于解决新的科学问题；教学工作所涉及的范围总是比较广泛，科学研究工作所涉及的对象总是比较深入，即使在较专门的课程中，这种差别也还是存在的。在教学过程中可能提出了许多不同的问题，但科学研究往往只能选择其中的一个问题作深入的探讨。如果要求教师们在科学研究中一下子解决教学中提出的所有的问题，那就会使科学研究工作无从进行。一般说来，教师所进行的科学研究的题目，应该正是教学中所发生的最主要的问题，这样来突破一点是可以达到全面地提高教学水平的目的的。但有时教学中产生的问题虽然重要，可是对于这个教师来说，不适合于作为他的科学研究题目，他按照自己的具体条件，选择了其他和目前教学内容较少直接联系的科学研究题目，这种情况也是可以容许的，不能认为这就是科学研究工作脱离了教学。因为只要教师认真进行了这种科学研究，并有所成就，终究对于他的教学水平的提高是有帮助的。何况一个教师的科学水平的提高，也并不能限于研究当前所教的一个科学部门，在特殊情况下
  （或因国家的特别需要，或因教师在某一方面有特长），也有可能需要教师去研究所教课程以外的其他学科的问题。
    制定科学研究计划以及科学和生产的结合
    正确地制定计划是组织科学研究工作的一个最重要的环节。有些人认为科学研究是探索未知的规律，因而也就不可能制定计划。这种意见是不对的。科学的发展有一定的规律，在每一个时代，每门科学总是适应着生产的需要，在其他科学影响之下并在前人大量的工作基础上遵循着一定的线索、方向而发展的。不能把科学研究看做是盲目的摸索，只是由于偶然的机会而达到新的成果。
    研究计划首先必须正确地贯彻“加强科学和生产的结合”的方针。但这种结合的形式是多种多样的。生产常常在科学面前提出了还没有答案的问题，要求通过创造性的科学研究来加以解决；为了解决生产中所提出的某些一般的总的问题，必须运用许多科学工作者的力量，进行很多实验和理论的分析。有时，在科学工作者面前还提出了不限于一门科学范围之内而是有关整个国民经济的问题，例如，对我国黄河区域开发的问题的研究。上述这些情形都是科学和生产有直接联系的。除此以外，还有另一类的结合方式，即这类科学常常需要经过整整一连串的环节才能和生产相联系。因此，在制定科学研究工作计划时，既不应忽视对当前实际工作直接有关的那些重要科学问题的研究，也不应偏废对基本理论问题的研究。
    科学和生产的结合既有多种形式，如果要使科学研究工作和国家建设要求密切结合，就必须从国家建设的全局出发，权衡各种科学问题的轻重缓急。为此，就如像很多人曾提出的，必须加强科学研究的统一计划和统一领导。这自然应该是中国科学院和高等教育部的责任。但是，在今天要求中国科学院和高等教育部在短期内即能拟出各个科学部门的全国性的科学研究计划，那是不可能的。而且，即便制定出这种全国性的科学研究计划，也只能是保证某些必不可少的科学工作的进行，决不可能如某些人所设想的那样，为全国近二百所大学详尽地规定一切研究题目。在科学工作上充分发挥科学家的主动性是十分必要的。在目前条件下，除了那些由国家直接提出的迫切任务以外，高等学校的研究计划，应该以研究者根据国家需要和专长主动提出的问题为基础，参考各方面的有益的建议，进行适当调整，不能坐待全国性的研究计划的制定。在这种情形下，科学研究计划的确定难免还有某些缺点。我们应该逐步地克服这些缺点，应该在争取广泛开展研究工作的基础上来求得逐步的提高，而不应在科学工作刚开始的时候，就提出过高要求而形成种种限制。
    必须正确地开展不同意见的争论和学术批评
    不论在高等学校或是任何的科学研究机关中，开展批评和讨论一直是发展科学的根本方法。因为在科学研究工作中常常由于人们认识的片面、客观现象表露程度的限制以及阶级偏见等影响而导向错误的认识。进行批评和讨论便能帮助我们克服错误，指出进一步发展的途径。
    但有些人认为目前不应开展批评。认为开展批评的先决条件是我国科学必须具有相当高的水平，否则如果发生不同意见，就没有人能做结论。这种意见是不对的。正因为我们的科学水平不高，才更需展开批评和讨论，来帮助我们不断地提高科学水平；正因为在科学问题上存在着不同意见，就更需要开展这种不同意见的争论，使争论焦点更为明确，更容易求得结论。科学发展的历史证明，许多根本性的科学问题的解决，常常是长期争论的结果。
    目前我国学术界中还很缺乏批评和讨论的风气。一方面，有人害怕因为批评的展开而影响了团结，因而常常以相互捧场代替了科学上求真理的原则，或者是大家把不同的意见摆在心里，表面上一团和气，实际上还是保存着旧时代的“文人相轻”的习气。但另一方面也发生过简单化的粗暴的批评，使别人误解了进行学术批评的目的，对批评望而生畏。
    我们不应以粗暴的态度对待有缺点的科学研究，同样，也不应该以粗暴的态度对待有缺点的批评。应该要求批评者所批评的事实绝对正确，不应歪曲原作者的本意；应该要求批评者采取谨慎负责的态度，在指出别人的错误时要经过充分的考虑和研究；但是如果要求批评者的观点和论断都必须绝对正确，那就会弄到没有批评。在一个科学问题还没有做出公认的正确的结论的时候，科学上的不同意见总是存在的。在科学上引起不同意见的争论是十分必要的，因为只有这样才能使大家获得提高和找到正确的结论。因此，我们除了应该善于批评别人以外，还应该善于对待别人的批评。
    进行批评和讨论的一种习用的方式是召开大小不同的讨论会，来讨论某一篇科学论文、某一本书，或是讨论某一科学问题、科学理论，批判地分析某一门科学研究的状况。科学讨论会曾在某些学校中实行，虽然也有一些讨论会因事先缺乏准备，只是由少数人作了报告，并未引起讨论，以致流于形式；但是认真举行的科学讨论会总是能够获得一定的效果的，特别是促进不同科学领域的学者的共同合作。
    积极克服各种困难和障碍有步骤地开展科学研究
    我们当前的一项重要任务，就在于努力开展科学研究工作。当然，开展科学研究的困难和障碍还是不少的。首先是在思想方面，例如有些学校领导人员怕科学研究开展起来妨碍了教学，有些学者怕因进行科学研究而戴上“追求个人名利”的帽子，许多教师则苦于研究方向很难确定，不知如何结合实际、结合教学。除了这些思想问题应求得统一的认识以外，工作条件上的一些困难也应当求得解决。
    首先便是时间问题。现在学校里常常感到没有时间进行研究，其中有两方面的原因。一方面是有些学校的工作还没有完全制度化，学校里非教学活动过多，有些教学活动也进行得不尽适当。另一方面也有很多教师不善于规划自己的工作。因此，时间问题必须从两方面来解决，一方面行政制度应进一步改善，另外也还需要教师自己善于抓紧一点一滴的时间。列宁格勒大学校长亚历山大洛夫说得好：“一个真正热爱科学的人不会没有时间进行研究，正如正在恋爱的人不会找不到时间和他的爱人会面一样。”我们看到有不少的老教师，一方面工作极忙，但一方面仍在进行研究。
    另一种困难是图书仪器不足。过分强调图书设备的不足所造成的困难是不对的。科学历史上许多杰出的工作常常是在困难的条件下进行的。去年中国科学院访苏代表团回国以后也告诉我们，苏联十分注意充分发挥房屋、图书、设备的潜在能力。但也必须承认，没有起码的图书、设备，就很难进行研究。在这一方面，目前我们的条件还是相当差的，特别是图书缺乏的情况更为严重。我国目前还没有完备的苏联和人民民主国家的科学文献，英美等资本主义国家的文献也多残缺不全。书刊发行机关新书供应的状况也不能令人满意，国外书刊常常供应不足。有些图书馆对于照顾科学研究的需要这一点还未给以应有的注意。在科学书籍的翻译上，目前对教科书的翻译已引起了重视，并已做出若干成绩（当然这还是不够的）；但对于和研究工作有关、足以培养科学干部的那些科学专著和经典著作的翻译还较少注意到。由于我国科学还很落后，急须吸收苏联以及其他国家的科学成就来丰富和发展我国的科学工作，所以对图书和杂志的供应问题，应该看做极为重要的问题。希望有关方面加强和改进这方面的工作。
    在仪器设备的购买和使用上面，也有一些问题。一方面是我们还没有自己的强大仪器、试药工业，以致有些仪器不能不靠国外的订货；但是另一方面，由于科学研究工作所需要的器材，多半是种类多、数量小，于是在对外贸易上引起了若干困难。曾经有人提出成立一个经营科学器材的公司。这个意见是值得有关方面注意的。
    在开展科学研究工作上也还存在着其他一些困难，但对于所有这些困难，我们都应该善于进行具体的分析，并且分别地加以克服。以时间问题来说，就必须加以具体分析，是全体的教师没有时间，还是只有少数的教研室或少数的教师没有时间。又以图书、仪器不足这一点来说，是我们的一切方面图书仪器都十分缺乏，还是仅仅某一方面，某一种类的图书仪器不足。为开展科学研究工作，必须善于分别各门科学的特点，分清各种不同的条件。要具体解决理论联系实际、研究结合教学等等的问题，要在各个教研室中确定开展研究的步骤，要制定教研室的和个人的研究计划等等，都需要考虑到各门科学的特点和各种不同的条件。我们应该根据这些不同情况、条件、特点，有分别、有步骤地把高等学校科学研究工作逐步开展起来。
