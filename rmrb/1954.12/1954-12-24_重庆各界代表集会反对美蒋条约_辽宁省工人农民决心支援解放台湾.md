    [Our Newspaper] Chongqing – More than 4,000 representatives from all walks of life in Chongqing gathered on the afternoon of the 22nd to oppose the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke at the meeting, saying: The "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed by the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique seriously infringes upon our country's sovereignty. Our 1.6 million people in the city are determined to support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement with practical actions and resolutely oppose the US-Chiang treaty. The people of the city must strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, suppress counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, and strive to do a good job in the current central task, increase production and practice economy, and actively support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Subsequently, combat hero Qi Peiyuan, industrial model worker Huang Rongchang, agricultural model worker Zheng Xianghui, and heads of the Chongqing local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations, Xia Zhongshi, Pan Dakui, Xu Chonglin, etc., spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their determination to do a good job in current tasks and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan with practical actions. Finally, the meeting adopted a resolution on supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, opposing the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," and resolutely liberating Taiwan.
   [Our Newspaper] – The working people of Liaoning Province resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty." The person in charge of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Trade Unions issued a written statement in support of Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, saying: The working class of Liaoning Province, together with the people of the whole country, is giving full play to its high degree of enthusiasm and creativity in various positions, further carrying out labor competitions in depth, ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the national production and construction plan, and supporting the struggle to liberate Taiwan. We will ensure that the front lines have whatever they need, and give whatever they ask for. The Tang Liyan work section of the steel casting plant of the Sino-Soviet Shipyard in Lüda City overfulfilled the state's quota for melting 107 tons of steel fifteen days ahead of schedule on December 15, and successfully realized the challenge conditions they put forward to the province's workers in September to support the liberation of Taiwan. Currently, the work section is writing a letter to the workers of the province, expressing their desire to produce more steel for the country to actively support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan. Huo Guanghong, the head of the forging workshop of the Benxi No. 1 Steel Plant and a model worker in Benxi City, proposed to strive to fully overfulfill the December production plan on the basis of ensuring quality to support the liberation of Taiwan. Hu Gaoqiang, assistant engineer of the blast furnace workshop, said: We will never allow our motherland's territory, Taiwan, to be ravaged by American aggressors. I will further study advanced Soviet experience, strive to increase the production of more iron, and contribute to the liberation of Taiwan. The members of the Qianjin Collective Farm in Benxi City also expressed their willingness to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions of increased production.
