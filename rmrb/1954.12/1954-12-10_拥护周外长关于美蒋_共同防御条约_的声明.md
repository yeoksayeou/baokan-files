Statement by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" thoroughly exposes the US government's sinister plot to permanently occupy our territory of Taiwan, expand its aggression against our country, and prepare for a new war by using the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. This statement once again solemnly demonstrates to the world the Chinese people's will to liberate Taiwan, oppose aggression, and defend peace. I, on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, express my resolute support.
    The US government's blatant war provocation cannot shake the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people are fully capable of carrying out the just struggle to liberate Taiwan to the end, and will never give up until the goal is achieved. Any attempt to undermine China's territorial sovereignty and integrity, or to sacrifice the interests of the Chinese people to cater to the US aggressive policy, is absurd and absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. Tolerating aggression is condoning aggression; fearing war will only invite the disasters of war, The Chinese people resolutely oppose war, but never fear war; cherish peace, but will never beg for peace at the cost of our territory and sovereignty. Whoever dares to attack the Chinese people will be punished by the Chinese people!
    The traitor Chiang Kai-shek, by signing the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the US government, not only sells out all of Taiwan's territorial sovereignty to the United States, but also attempts to realize his dream of restoring his reactionary rule on the mainland by selling out Chinese territorial sovereignty beyond Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, in order to prolong its existence, is willing to act as an accomplice of the tiger, signing a traitorous treaty and acting as a pawn in the US war of aggression. This treaty is illegal and invalid, and can only further arouse the Chinese people's bitter hatred. Chiang's treasonous crimes will never escape the net of the people's law!
    People who were deceived and coerced by Chiang to flee to Taiwan, after seeing the US-Chiang treaty, you should see clearly the ugly face of the US aggressors and Chiang's extreme wickedness. If you are unwilling to be the eternal sinners of the nation, unwilling to perish with Chiang, then you can only arouse your conscience, wake up and return to the light as soon as possible, and perform meritorious service to atone for your sins!

    Oppose Chiang's Treachery in Selling Out Taiwan
    Li Chunqing, Vice Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League
    I fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement on the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," and I believe that the people of Taiwan will also sincerely support it.
    From a certain point of view, that "treaty" is another form of the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Chiang Kai-shek has sold Taiwan to the United States. According to that "treaty," Taiwan is already a "link" in the US "defense chain" and has been merged into the US defense map. Taiwan has been separated from China. On the day the "treaty" was signed, Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Dulles, congratulating the US "defense" on the "link" that had been "forged." He hung his "Republic of China" sign on the wall of the United States of America, begging the United States to "protect" his "security." The United States accepted the "good partner's" kindness in offering Taiwan with both hands, and then used a treaty to "forge" Taiwan into a piece of land ruled by the United States. This is the second "cession of Taiwan" in Chinese history. According to Articles 7 and 10 of that "treaty," the United States will occupy Taiwan and Penghu "indefinitely," "deploy" its "land, sea, and air forces," and exercise a kind of sovereignty called "rights." From now on, all the people of Taiwan, including Chiang Kai-shek's subordinates and himself, must, as US citizens, be loyal to the US "defense" and "security," that is, be loyal to the US policy of aggression and war. If patriots in Taiwan rise up to oppose the brutal rule of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek, according to Article 2 of the "treaty," that is a "harm" to the "territorial integrity" and "political stability" of Taiwan from "abroad," and they will be killed without mercy. How absurd and how vicious this is!
    The US aggressors are following the path taken by Japan to seize Taiwan. The difference is that Japan directly ruled Taiwan, while the United States temporarily rules Taiwan through the Chiang Kai-shek puppet it controls. Regarding this point, anyone who has seen the tricks of the puppet Manchuria and the "Wang regime" can confidently strip off Chiang Kai-shek's tattered coat and let any passer-by verify the true identity of this traitor.
    When the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, the people of Taiwan were in the tiger's mouth. They used the determination to poison the tiger with arsenic to deal with Japan. Japan ruled Taiwan for half a century, and the people of Taiwan paid with more than 500,000 lives, showing the world that the people of Taiwan will not be foreign slaves, and Taiwan is the sacred territory of China. The US rulers pretend not to know this. The people of Taiwan fundamentally negated Chiang Kai-shek's rule over Taiwan in the "February 28th" uprising in 1947. The US rulers also pretend not to know this.
    It should be solemnly announced to the world that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has absolutely no right to sign any treaty. It can neither represent China nor represent the people of Taiwan. The Taiwanese people's answer to the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" has no second sentence, and can only be like the text of the denunciation of Li Hongzhang, "We will not live under the same sky."--The Taiwanese people and Chiang Kai-shek "will not live under the same sky!"
    The people of Taiwan remember that a piece of the Treaty of Shimonoseki made their fathers, sons, and grandsons sink into slavery for two or three generations. That was such a terrible nightmare. Now, Chiang Kai-shek and the United States have signed a so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty," selling Taiwan again. Chiang Kai-shek and Dulles used Taiwan and the eight million Chinese people in Taiwan as the object of "trade." Today, the Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan, cannot but issue a serious warning to them: this "trade" is like playing with fire, and those who play with fire will burn themselves!
    The people of Taiwan will not be foreign slaves, and the people of Taiwan have a sea of ​​blood and deep hatred for Chiang Kai-shek, which must be avenged. If they are forced to shed blood, the people of Taiwan have never been stingy with shedding blood for the motherland. The US aggressors should know that the blood shed in 1947, the blood shed for decades and even hundreds of years to resist aggression and tyranny, every drop of blood is still shining. Chiang Kai-shek should know that the Taiwanese people will never forget the floating corpses in Keelung Harbor, the loyal bones buried alive at the foot of Yuanshan Mountain in Taipei, the fallen brothers at Chiayi Airport, and the women and children brutally killed in Kaohsiung City. They must raise the torch of revenge for the Taiwanese people and completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
    1954 is not 1895. Today Taiwan cannot be sold! Because the Taiwanese people already have a great motherland - the People's Republic of China. Beside the people of Taiwan stand six hundred million heroic brothers and sisters. No force can stop the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. The Taiwanese people know that the day of liberation is coming. They are full of confidence in victory and are with the people of the motherland, ready to join the battle at any time, ready to bury the US-Chiang "treaty" and Chiang Kai-shek together.

### 拥护周外长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明

    拥护周外长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深的谈话
    周恩来外长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，彻底揭露了美国政府利用卖国贼蒋介石妄图永远武装占领我国领土台湾、扩大对我国的侵略、准备新的战争的罪恶勾当。这一声明再一次郑重地向全世界表明了中国人民解放台湾、反对侵略、保卫和平的意志，我代表中国国民党革命委员会表示坚决拥护。
    美国政府明目张胆的战争挑衅是动摇不了中国人民解放台湾的决心的。中国人民完全有力量把解放台湾的正义斗争进行到底，不达目的，决不罢休。任何企图损害中国领土主权完整、牺牲中国人民利益以迎合美国侵略政策的主张都是荒谬的，中国人民绝对不能同意。容忍侵略，就是纵容侵略；畏惧战争，只会招致战争的灾害。中国人民坚决反对战争，但绝不畏惧战争；爱好和平，但决不拿自己的领土和主权做代价乞求和平。谁敢向中国人民进攻，谁就要遭到中国人民的惩罚！
    卖国贼蒋介石同美国政府签订所谓“共同防御条约”，不但把台湾的领土主权全部出卖给美国，而且妄图以出卖台湾以外的中国领土主权，来实现他的反动统治在大陆上复辟的迷梦。蒋介石卖国集团为了苟延残喘，甘心为虎作伥，签订了卖国条约，充当美国侵略战争的马前走卒。这个条约是非法的，无效的，它只能更激起中国人民的切齿痛恨。蒋贼的卖国罪行决不能逃脱人民的法网！
    被蒋贼欺骗裹胁逃到台湾的人们，你们看到美蒋条约以后，应该看清楚美国侵略者的狰狞面目和蒋贼的穷凶极恶了。你们如果不愿意做国家民族的千古罪人，不愿意和蒋贼同归于尽，就只有激发天良，幡然猛醒，及早弃暗投明，立功赎罪！（新华社）
    反对蒋贼出卖台湾
    台湾民主自治同盟副主席  李纯青
    周恩来外交部长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明，我完全拥护，并且相信台湾人民也一定衷心拥护。
    从某个角度来说，那个“条约”是另一种形式的马关条约，蒋介石把台湾出卖给美国了。根据那个“条约”，台湾已经是美国的“防务锁链”的一个“环节”，已经合并在美国国防版图之内。台湾已经从中国割裂出去。在“条约”签字之日，蒋介石拍电报给杜勒斯，祝贺美国“防务”的“环节”已经“铸成”。他把他的“中华民国”这块招牌，挂在美利坚合众国的墙壁上，乞求美国“保护”他的“安全”。美国接受这个“好伙伴”双手奉献台湾的美意，于是用条约形式把台湾“铸成”为美国统治的一块土地。这是中国历史上第二次的“割台湾”。依照那个“条约”第七条和第十条的规定，美国将“无限期”地占据台湾、澎湖，“部署”它的“陆海空军”，行使一种叫做“权利”的主权。从今而后，所有台湾人民，包括蒋介石的部下和他本人，都必须以美国公民的身分，效忠于美国的
  “防御”和“安全”，即效忠于美国的侵略政策和战争政策。如果台湾有爱国者起来反对美国和蒋介石的残暴统治，按照“条约”第二条所说，那就是从“国外”来的“危害”美国的“领土完整”和台湾的“政治安定”，格杀勿论。这是何等荒谬、何等毒辣啊！
    美国侵略者踏着日本走过的道路来霸占台湾。所不同的是：日本对台湾是直接统治，而美国统治台湾暂时还通过它所操纵的蒋介石傀儡。关于这一点，凡是看过伪满洲国和“汪政权”的把戏的人们，都有把握把蒋介石那件褴褛的外衣剥掉，让任何过路人来验明这个卖国贼的正身。
    满清政府签订马关条约，当时台湾人民身处虎口，他们曾以吃下砒霜毒死老虎的决心，与日本相周旋。日本统治台湾半世纪，台湾人民付出了五十万以上的生命，向世界表明：台湾人民不做外国的奴隶，台湾是中国神圣的领土。美国统治者装做不知道这件事。蒋介石对台湾的统治，台湾人民早在一九四七年“二二八”起义中予以根本否定。美国统治者也装做不知道这件事。
    应该向世界郑重宣告：蒋介石卖国集团绝对无权签订任何条约，它既不能代表中国，也不能代表台湾人民。台湾人民对于美蒋“共同防御条约”的回答，没有第二句话，只能像当年讨伐李鸿章檄文所说，“不共戴天”。——台湾人民和蒋介石“不共戴天”！
    台湾人民记得，一纸马关条约使他们父子祖孙两三辈沉沦为奴隶。那是一个多么可怕的噩梦。而今，蒋介石和美国签订所谓“共同防御条约”，再度把台湾出卖。蒋介石和杜勒斯把台湾和在台湾的八百万中国人民作为“交易”的对象。今天中国人民，包括台湾人民，不能不向他们提出严重的警告：这桩“交易”等于玩火，而玩火者必自焚！
    台湾人民是不做外国的奴隶的，台湾人民对蒋介石有血海深仇，非报不可。如果被迫需要流血，台湾人民为了祖国从来不吝流血。美国侵略者应该晓得，一九四七年所流的血，数十年以至数百年来为反抗侵略和暴政而流的血，每一滴血都还在闪光。蒋介石应该晓得，台湾人民永不忘基隆海港的浮尸，台北圆山脚下活埋的忠骨，嘉义飞机场的阵亡兄弟，高雄市内被惨杀的妇女幼儿，他们一定要台湾人民举起复仇的火把，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团。
    一九五四年不是一八九五年，今天台湾是卖不得的！因为台湾人民已有一个伟大的祖国——中华人民共和国，台湾人民的身边，站着六亿英雄的兄弟姊妹。任何力量都不能阻止中国人民解放台湾，台湾人民知道解放的日子将要到来，他们满怀胜利的信心，和祖国人民在一起，准备随时投入战斗，准备把美蒋“条约”和蒋介石一同下葬。
