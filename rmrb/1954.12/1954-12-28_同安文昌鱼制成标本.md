Amoy lancelets, one of the special products of Fujian Province, which are of great research value in the history of biological evolution, are a rare marine product. It is a product of the period when animals evolved from invertebrates to vertebrates. It is rarely found anywhere in the world or in other provinces of China. Only Liuwudian and Qiongtou in Tong'an County, Fujian Province, produce a large number of them. Academic institutions, universities, and middle schools at home and abroad have written letters requesting lancelet specimens for research purposes. The Xiamen Municipal People's Government Cultural Affairs Management Office allocated 6 million yuan in April this year to the Municipal Science and Technology Popularization Association Preparatory Committee for trial production. The association has successfully trial-produced various types of lancelet specimens for slicing, lancelet specimens with gonads, whole-mount lancelet specimens, and general lancelet specimens for preservation. Some finished products have begun to be supplied.
