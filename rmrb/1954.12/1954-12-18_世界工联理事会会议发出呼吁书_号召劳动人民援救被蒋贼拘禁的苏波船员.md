Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 15th: The Council meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions adopted a call, appealing to the working people and trade union organizations of the world to rescue the crew members of the Polish merchant ship "President Gottwald" and the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse," who were illegally detained and imprisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

The appeal stated that these Polish and Soviet sailors have been cut off from contact with their families, held in complete isolation, and subjected to inhumane treatment in order to frustrate their will and force them to refuse to return to their countries.

In its appeal, the World Federation of Trade Unions requested the working people and trade union organizations of all countries to issue demands for the immediate and unconditional release of their worker brothers and to stop the piratical acts endangering safety and peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 15th: The Council meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions adopted an open letter to UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld and UN General Assembly President Eelco van Kleffens.

The letter pointed out that the Polish merchant ship "President Gottwald" and the Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" were hijacked to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek's warships, and their crew members were imprisoned. The letter also pointed out that ships of other countries have also been attacked by Chiang Kai-shek's armed forces in the Far East seas. These actions, which threaten the safety of the Far East seas and violate the universally recognized principles of freedom of navigation, are an integral part of the entire illegal action by which the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the U.S. government are intensifying the international situation.

In its letter, the Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions protested this blatant violation of human rights, safety, and freedom of navigation in the Far East seas and demanded that Hammarskjöld and Van Kleffens personally take all possible measures to secure the early release of the crew members of the "President Gottwald" and "Tuapse."

    世界工联理事会会议发出呼吁书
    号召劳动人民援救被蒋贼拘禁的苏波船员
    并致电联合国秘书长和联大主席抗议美蒋的海盗行为
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社华沙十五日讯：世界工会联合会理事会会议通过了一个呼吁书，号召全世界的劳动人民和工会组织援救被蒋介石集团非法扣留和监禁的波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德总统号”和苏联油船“图阿普斯号”的船员。
    呼吁书中说，这些波兰和苏联水手被割断了同他们家庭的联系，被扣留在完全隔离的环境中，并且遭受着非人道待遇，以便挫折他们的意志和强使他们拒绝回国。
    世界工联理事会在呼吁书中请求一切国家的劳动人民和工会组织发出要求：立即无条件地释放他们的工人兄弟；制止危害安全和和平的海盗行为。
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社华沙十五日讯：世界工会联合会理事会会议通过了致联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和联合国大会主席范·克里芬斯的公开信。
    信中指出，波兰商船“哥特瓦尔德总统号”和苏联油船“图阿普斯号”被蒋介石军舰劫往台湾，它们的船员被囚禁起来。信中还指出，其他国家的船只也在远东海面受到蒋贼武装部队的袭击。威胁远东海面安全和违反公认的航行自由原则的行径，是蒋介石集团和美国政府正在借以加剧国际局势的整个非法行动中的一个组成部分。
    世界工会联合会理事会在信中抗议这种在远东海面对人权、安全和航行自由的粗暴侵犯，并且要求哈马舍尔德和范·克里芬斯本人采取一切可能的措施，争取及早释放“哥特瓦尔德总统号”和“图阿普斯号”的船员。
