Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Your Excellency Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen:

　　Now, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, I once again express my welcome and gratitude for Prime Minister U Nu's visit. Without a doubt, through Prime Minister U Nu's visit, the friendship between China and Burma, on the basis of the Five Principles we have jointly established, will be further developed.

　　Today, in his sincere speech, Prime Minister U Nu displayed the passionate friendship, national self-respect, and yearning for peace that are worthy of praise in a leader of an independent country.

　　It is natural that two new countries with different social systems that are also neighbors may have some doubts and misunderstandings about each other upon initial contact. However, on the basis of the long-term friendship between China and Burma in history, and after these years of establishing new friendly relations, especially the mutual visits of the two Prime Ministers and the establishment of the Five Principles, these doubts and misunderstandings have gradually been eliminated.

　　Prime Minister U Nu will take back with him from China this time the friendship of the Chinese people. Cooperation between the two countries will also greatly increase. I believe that there is no distinction between large and small between our two countries, only the friendship of friends. In the cooperation of friendly countries, there is no place for instigators of discord.

　　Any opposing countries in the world, if they do not occupy other people's territory, infringe upon other people's sovereignty, or interfere in other people's internal affairs, can become mutually friendly countries. The People's Republic of China adheres to this belief. We hope that, through Prime Minister U Nu's appeal, if it can cause the armies of certain countries to withdraw from other people's territories, make them recognize the principle that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, no longer infringe upon other people's sovereignty, and no longer interfere in other people's internal affairs, it will make an incomparable contribution to easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace. The Chinese people are willing to support Prime Minister U Nu's efforts in this regard.

　　Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!

　　Long live world peace!

　　Finally, I propose a toast to the health of His Excellency President Ba U of the Union of Burma!

### 周恩来总理的讲话

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话总理阁下，各位女士，各位先生：
    现在我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民，再一次对吴努总理阁下的访问表示欢迎和感谢。毫无疑问，通过吴努总理阁下的访问，中缅两国的友谊，在我们共同确定的五项原则的基础上，将会更加发展起来。
    今天，吴努总理阁下在他的诚挚的讲话中，作为一个独立国家的领导者所表现的热情的友谊、民族自尊的气概和对和平的热望，是值得称赞的。
    社会制度不同而又紧邻的两个新的国家，在初接触时，彼此存在着若干疑惧，互不了解，这是很自然的。但是，中缅两国在历史上长期友好的基础上，经过这几年新的友好关系的建立，特别是两国总理的相互访问和五项原则的确立，已经使这种疑惧和不了解逐渐消除。
    吴努总理阁下这次从中国带回去的，将是中国人民的友谊。两国的合作也将大大增加。我相信，我们两国之间没有大小之分，只有朋友之谊。在友好国家的合作中，是没有挑拨离间者的地位的。
    世界上任何对立的国家，如果不霸占人家的领土，不侵犯人家的主权，不干涉人家的内政，都可以成为相互友好的国家。中华人民共和国是坚持这个信念的。我们希望，经过吴努总理阁下的呼吁，如果能使某些国家的军队从人家的领土上撤退，使它们承认不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处的原则，不再侵犯人家的主权，不再干涉人家的内政，那将对缓和国际紧张局势和保卫世界和平有无可比拟的贡献。中国人民愿意支持吴努总理在这方面的努力。
    中缅友好万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    最后，我提议为缅甸联邦总统巴宇博士阁下的健康干杯！
