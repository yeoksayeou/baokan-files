The Supreme People's Procuratorate, in accordance with the procedural provisions for exercising its functions under the "Organic Law of the People's Procuratorates of the People's Republic of China," issued a "Request" on November 10, urging the State Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance to learn from the serious lessons of the major embezzlement of state tax revenue by Zhang Guangyi, a tax form filler in the Third Tax Collection Team of the Third Branch of the Jinan Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau. The request calls for effective measures to be taken to address the causes of the embezzlement, and to fight against the phenomenon of embezzlement and theft in tax authorities.

According to the "Request," the former Jinan Municipal People's Procuratorate accepted the accusation from the Jinan Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau on June 5th this year and investigated the case of Zhang Guangyi, a tax form filler in the Third Tax Collection Team of the Third Branch of the Bureau, who embezzled state tax revenue.

The investigation proved that from October 13, 1952, to May 4th this year, Zhang Guangyi had embezzled over 114.18 million yuan of state tax revenue that could be verified. The former Jinan Municipal People's Procuratorate, in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations on Punishing Embezzlement of the People's Republic of China, filed a public prosecution with the Jinan Municipal People's Court, requesting that Zhang Guangyi be severely punished according to law. The Jinan Municipal People's Court held a public trial on October 31st and sentenced the embezzler Zhang Guangyi to death.

The circumstances of Zhang Guangyi's embezzlement were extremely serious. Judging only from the 214 forged tax receipts that had been checked, the taxpaying merchants actually paid over 111.19 million yuan in taxes, but only over 10.05 million yuan was turned over to the state treasury; Zhang Guangyi embezzled over 101.14 million yuan. In addition, there were 37 tax receipts without recorded numbers, which were difficult to check. Because the original taxpayers were scattered in Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, and Northeast China, and because these merchants had changed professions or moved, the original tax receipts were difficult to recover, so the specific amount of embezzlement by Zhang Guangyi was temporarily difficult to ascertain.

Zhang Guangyi's embezzlement was carried out in a long-term and planned manner. The main method of embezzlement was to use the method of "false at both ends, real in the middle" when filling out various tax receipts such as temporary commercial tax, commodity circulation tax, and goods tax. He separated the three-part tax receipt with paper and filled it out twice. First, he filled out the second part truthfully and gave it to the merchant. Then, on the first part (stub) and the third part (for verification), he forged the taxpayer's name, product name, and total value, reducing the tax amount and embezzling the difference.

It can be clearly seen from the verified tax receipts that Zhang Guangyi's embezzlement was not an occasional offense, but a habitual one. Starting last year, he embezzled not only every month, but for a period of time, he embezzled every day, sometimes even several times a day. On January 11th this year, he embezzled five times, totaling 3,389,800 yuan. The merchant Liu Xiaozhou paid taxes four times in April this year, totaling 1,716,800 yuan, and Zhang Guangyi embezzled each time, totaling 1,450,000 yuan. On the day he was arrested, he embezzled 750,000 yuan from the 776,400 yuan of tea dust tax paid by the Zhongnan "Chengji" firm.

Zhang Guangyi squandered the state money he embezzled at will, buying 44 items such as Western suits, furniture, watches, and leather suitcases, and giving them to his girlfriend, totaling more than 26 million yuan. The amount he squandered while visiting Shanghai and spending time in the Peace Hotel was difficult to calculate. He also deposited more than 80 million yuan of embezzled money in banks in Shanghai, Jinan, and other places under assumed names, preparing to accumulate more ill-gotten gains and then leave revolutionary work to open a cafe in Shanghai.

The cause of this embezzlement incident, in addition to Zhang Guangyi's extremely bad character, was primarily due to the fact that the tax branch did not strictly implement the system, and arbitrarily changed the "mutual review of three parts" system to "review of one part," only reviewing the second part when collecting taxes, while the first and third parts were stamped together every ten days. Secondly, there were also problems with the division of labor among the staff: originally, the work of issuing receipts, collecting money, and checking was divided among three people, but later it was changed to one person, lacking strict mutual restraint, allowing Zhang Guangyi to issue receipts, collect money, and even "check" himself, thus creating a large loophole. In addition, the leadership of the tax branch had serious bureaucratic work styles and lacked strict management and inspection systems for the staff, so that Zhang Guangyi continued to embezzle for such a long period of time without being discovered; Zhang Guangyi's corrupt lifestyle exposed many suspicious points, and there were multiple reports from the masses, but they did not attract the attention of the leadership.

The Supreme People's Procuratorate's investigation found that in some tax departments, due to unsound systems or failure to strictly implement the systems, embezzlers and thieves had opportunities to exploit. This situation was not an isolated phenomenon nationwide, and the method of embezzlement similar to Zhang Guangyi's was also used in other regions.

After receiving the "Request" from the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the State Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance submitted it to a bureau affairs meeting for discussion, and exchanged views with the Supreme People's Procuratorate, deciding to take the following measures:

First, the "Request" from the Supreme People's Procuratorate should be printed and distributed to all units under the State Taxation Administration, together with the "Notice on Strictly Preventing Embezzlement and Theft by Tax Workers" published in the 26th issue of the "Tax Work Bulletin" and the "Joint Inspection Report on the Embezzlement and Theft Case in the Jinan Municipal Taxation Bureau" from six units, including the East China Tax Administration Bureau. Organize staff to study, with responsible cadres of each unit personally in charge, combined with the actual situation, conduct a careful inspection of whether the various systems are strict, put forward improvement suggestions, and report to the bureau affairs meeting; and constantly raise vigilance and strengthen education for all staff on strictly observing laws and disciplines.

Second, instruct tax bureaus at all levels to conduct an anti-embezzlement inspection based on the "Request" and the State Taxation Administration's "(54) Jian Zi No. 59 Circular," under the leadership and supervision of local party committees and financial and economic committees, and submit a summary report on the inspection results within a time limit. At the same time, discuss this issue at the recent professional meeting on tax supervision work, and include it as one of the main tasks of tax supervision work in 1955.

Third, publish an abstract of the inspection and handling of Zhang Guangyi's embezzlement case in the "Tax Gazette," calling on the masses to report and accuse tax workers of embezzlement, theft, and other illegal and criminal acts, so as to give play to the supervisory role of the masses. Issue instructions and comments in the internally distributed "Tax Work Bulletin," instructing all tax workers to conduct strict inspections and fight for the universal and thorough elimination of embezzlement and theft in tax authorities.

In addition, the State Taxation Administration has sent a commissioner from the Supervision Office to Jinan City to further understand the situation and learn from the experience and lessons.

### 最高人民检察院  提请税务总局采取措施防止贪污盗窃现象

    最高人民检察院
    提请税务总局采取措施防止贪污盗窃现象
    最高人民检察院根据“中华人民共和国人民检察院组织法”中关于行使职权的程序的规定，在十一月十日发出“提请书”一件，提请财政部税务总局吸取济南市人民政府税务局第三分局第三稽征组填票员章光益大量贪污国家税款事件的严重教训，针对发生贪污的原因采取有效措施，为防止税务机关中的贪污盗窃现象而斗争。
    据“提请书”说，前济南市人民检察署在今年六月五日受理了济南市人民政府税务局的控告，对该局第三分局第三稽征组填票员章光益贪污国家税款案进行了侦查。
    侦查结果证明，章光益从一九五二年十月十三日起到今年五月四日止，贪污国家税款已证实的就有一亿一千四百一十八万多元。前济南市人民检察署依据中华人民共和国惩治贪污条例的规定，向济南市人民法院提起公诉，请依法严惩章光益。济南市人民法院已经在十月三十一日举行公判庭，判处贪污犯章光益死刑。
    章光益贪污的情况十分严重。仅从已经查对清楚的章光益伪造的二百十四份税票计算，纳税商人实际纳税一亿一千一百一十九万多元，但是缴入国库的只有一千零五万多元；章光益从中贪污一亿零一百一十四万多元。另外还有三十七份税票，因为没有记载号码，难于查对，又因为原纳税商人散布河北、江苏、安徽、浙江、福建、山东和东北各地，加上这些商人已经转业、迁移等原因，原税票很难追回，所以章光益从中贪污的具体数字，一时难于查清。
    章光益的贪污行为是长期有计划地进行的。贪污的主要方法，就是在填写临商税、商品流动税、货物税等各种税票的时候，用“两头虚、中间实”的办法，把三联税票用纸隔开，分两次填写，先把第二联照实填写交给商人，然后在第一联（存根）和第三联（报查）上伪造纳税人姓名、品名和总值等，从中缩小税额，进行贪污。
    从查明证实的税票中可以明显地看出，章光益的贪污不是偶犯，而是连续贪污的惯犯。从去年起不仅每月都有贪污，有一段时间每日都有贪污，有时甚至每天贪污几次。今年一月十一日那天，他就贪污五次，计三百三十八万九千八百元。商人刘筱舟在今年四月间先后四次缴纳税款计一百七十一万六千八百元，而章光益就每次都进行贪污，四次贪污计一百四十五万元。被捕的那天，他还在中南“诚记”商号缴纳的茶末税款七十七万六千四百元中贪污了七十五万元。
    章光益用贪污得到的国家钱财，任意挥霍，购买西装、家具、手表、皮箱等四十四件，并送给他的女朋友等共计二千六百多万元，游逛上海和平日挥霍的数字已经难于计算。他还把贪污的赃款八千多万元分别化名存入上海、济南等地的银行，准备更大量地积累脏款，然后脱离革命工作，到上海开咖啡馆。
    造成这一贪污事件的原因，除了章光益的品质极端恶劣以外，首先是由于该税务分局没有严格执行制度，擅自把“互审三联”的制度改为“审核一联”，就只是在收税的时候复核第二联，而第一、第三两联采取每十日一起盖章的办法；其次，工作人员的分工上也有问题：原来开票、收款、核对等工作由三人分工，后来改由一人担任，缺乏严格的互相制约，任凭章光益一人开票、收款，甚至自行“核对”，因而造成了很大漏洞。此外该税务分局领导方面有着严重的官僚主义作风，对工作人员缺乏严格的管理和检查制度，以致章光益在这样长的时期内，连续进行贪污而没有被发现；章光益平日生活腐化，暴露了很多可疑之点，并有群众多次检举，但都没有引起领导方面的注意。
    最高人民检察院调查发现，某些税务部门由于制度不健全，或者没有严格贯彻执行制度，使贪污盗窃分子有隙可乘，这种情况在全国范围内并不是个别现象，用类似章光益的贪污方式进行贪污的情况，别的地区也有。
    财政部税务总局接到最高人民检察院的“提请书”以后，提交局务会议进行了讨论，并且和最高人民检察院交换意见，决定采取下列措施：
    首先，把最高人民检察院的“提请书”印发税务总局所属各单位结合“税务工作通报”第二十六期刊登的“严格防止税工人员贪污盗窃行为的通报”和华东区税管局等六个单位“对济南市税务局发生贪污盗窃案的联合检查报告”两个文件，组织工作人员学习，由各单位负责干部亲自掌握，结合实际情况，认真地进行一次有关各项制度是否严密的检查，提出改进意见，向局务会议报告；并经常提高警惕，加强对全体工作人员严格遵守法纪的教育。
    其次，指示各级税务局根据“提请书”和税务总局“（五四）监字第五九号通报”，在各地党委和财经委员会的领导、督促下切实进行一次反贪污的检查，并限期把检查结果作出总结报告。同时在最近召开的税务监察工作专业会议上进行讨论，把这一问题列为一九五五年税务监察工作的主要任务之一。
    第三，把章光益贪污案的检查处理经过情况摘要在“税务公报”上发表，号召群众对税务工作人员的贪污、盗窃等违法犯罪行为进行检举和控告，以发挥群众性的监督作用。在内部发行的“税务工作通报”上发布指示和评论，指示全体税务工作人员进行严格检查，为普遍、彻底地消灭税务机关中的贪污、盗窃现象而斗争。
    另外，税务总局已经派监察室专员去济南市进一步深入了解情况，吸取经验教训。
