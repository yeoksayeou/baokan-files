TASS Statement
Condemns the US and British Governments for Applying Brutal Pressure on France

[Xinhua News Agency, December 26th dispatch] TASS, Moscow, December 25th:

TASS issues the following statement: As a result of the French National Assembly rejecting on December 24th the proposal to authorize the French President to ratify the Paris Agreements regarding the remilitarization of West Germany and the establishment of a Western European military alliance, the United States and Britain are intensifying pressure on France. President Eisenhower and the British government have both issued statements saying that they will strive to have the French National Assembly's decision reconsidered. Following these statements are threats to rebuild the German "Defense Force" while bypassing France.

Soviet government figures believe that these statements and threats constitute brutal pressure exerted by foreign powers on the French Parliament and the French government, with the aim of forcing France to ratify the Paris Agreements. Soviet government figures believe that the process of the French National Assembly debating the Paris Agreements and the vote on December 24th demonstrate that the French people are recognizing the serious consequences that the revival of West German militarism, as stipulated in the Paris Agreements, would have on France's national security. Despite the nonsense being spread by some people, France increasingly understands that ratifying the Paris Agreements would hinder negotiations on resolving the German question and render such negotiations meaningless.

The security of France and the security of all of Europe are indivisible. Historical experience proves that the development and consolidation of friendly relations and cooperation between France and the Soviet Union will make an immeasurable contribution to consolidating pan-European security and preventing a new war.

    塔斯社发表声明
    斥美英政府对法国施加粗暴压力
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日电：
    塔斯社声明如下：由于法国国民议会在十二月二十四日拒绝了准许法国总统批准关于使西德重新军国主义化以及建立西欧军事联盟的巴黎协定的提案，美国和英国方面正在对法国加紧施行压力。艾森豪威尔总统和英国政府都发表声明说，他们将力求使法国国民议会采取的决定获得一个重新的考虑。紧跟着这些声明来的是，撇开法国而重建德国“国防军”的威胁。
    苏联政府人士认为这种声明和威胁是由外面对法国议会和法国政府施加的粗暴压力，它的目的是要使法国批准巴黎协定。苏联政府人士认为，法国国民议会辩论巴黎协定问题的过程以及十二月二十四日的表决情况表明：法国人民正认识到巴黎协定所规定的复活西德军国主义会给法国的国家安全造成怎样严重的后果。尽管有些人在胡说八道，但是法国在越来越明白，批准巴黎协定会阻碍关于解决德国问题的谈判，会使这种谈判失去任何意义。
    法国的安全和整个欧洲的安全不可分割。历史经验证明，发展和巩固法苏两国间的友好关系和合作，对巩固全欧安全和防止新战争的事业会有不可衡量的贡献。
