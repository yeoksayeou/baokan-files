Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 29th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army has mostly completed the construction of martyrs' cemeteries and memorial pavilions in memory of the martyrs who gloriously sacrificed themselves in the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. As of the end of November, the construction of martyrs' cemeteries in the famous battlefields of Unsan, Kasan, Changjin Lake, Triangle Hill, and Kimhwa had been completed. The construction of the martyrs' memorial pavilions will be completed before the freeze this year and in the spring of next year. The construction of martyrs' cemeteries or memorial pavilions in Songak Mountain in Kaesong, on the banks of the Chongchon River, Ichon, Chorwon, Pyonggang, and "Baldy Mountain" had also been basically completed by the end of November.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army attached great importance to the construction of the martyrs' cemeteries. The headquarters and political department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army jointly issued instructions to the entire army on the construction of martyrs' cemeteries and memorial pavilions in April of this year and established the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery Construction Committee to guide the construction work. The leading organs of the volunteer army also established martyrs' cemetery construction committees in May and transferred cadres, engineering corps, and engineering technicians to participate in the construction project. Since the start of the Changjin Lake Martyrs' Cemetery construction project in early August of this year, more than 820 engineering corps, engineering technicians, and cadres with construction experience participated in the project. In order to select cemetery sites with beautiful scenery by mountains and rivers and white and strong steles, they often had to walk through many mountains. In the work of moving the remains of the martyrs, they carefully recorded the names, ranks, birthplaces, and burial locations of the martyrs and inscribed monuments in front of each martyr's tomb. The tombs were surrounded by railings, and wide and deep drainage ditches were dug. Many tombs were surrounded by evergreen pines and cypresses. The monument in front of the Martyrs' Cemetery in the Triangle Hill area is engraved with the four golden characters "International Glory." The monument at the Martyrs' Cemetery in the Chorwon area is also engraved with elegiac couplets and eulogies. A garden was built on the left side of the mausoleum gate of the Martyrs' Cemetery at the foot of Songak Mountain in Kaesong, and a lotus pond was transformed from a bomb crater on the right side. On the tombstones of some martyrs' cemeteries, the golden characters on a red background "Eternal Glory to the Martyrs Who Sacrificed Themselves in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea" are prominently engraved.

The Korean Workers' Party, the Korean government, the Korean People's Army, and the people of various regions are very concerned about the construction of martyrs' cemeteries in various places. More than 300 Korean people in Gisam-ri, Unpa County, built a channel of more than 700 meters long for the martyrs' cemetery, and more than 400 teachers and students of Gisam-ri Elementary School also voluntarily planted more than 1,000 saplings and a large number of flowers and plants around the cemetery. The people of South Hamgyong Province also specially built a monument for the volunteer army's special-class hero Yang Gensi, who died heroically in the Battle of Changjin Lake. Many Korean people also rushed to pay their respects and sacrifices when the martyrs' cemeteries were completed, in accordance with Korean customs, and they offered a large number of wreaths and sacrifices in front of the martyrs' tombs.

    志愿军修建的烈士陵园和纪念亭大部完成
    据新华社平壤二十九日电：中国人民志愿军各部队为纪念在伟大的抗美援朝斗争中光荣牺牲的烈士而修建的烈士陵园和烈士纪念亭已大部完成。到十一月底止，在朝鲜的著名战地云山、价川、长津湖畔、上甘岭、金城等地区的烈士陵园的修建工程已全部完工；烈士纪念亭的修建工程将在今年封冻前和明年春天完成；在开城松岳山麓清川江畔、伊川、铁原、平康、“老秃山”等地的烈士陵园或烈士纪念亭的修建工程也都在十一月底基本完工。
    中国人民志愿军各部队都十分重视烈士陵园的修建工作。中国人民志愿军司令部、政治部在今年四月间曾向全军联合发出关于修建烈士陵园和烈士纪念亭的指示，并成立了中国人民志愿军烈士陵园修建委员会，负责指导建陵工作的进行。志愿军各部队领导机关也在五月份成立了烈士陵园修建委员会，并抽调了干部和工兵部队、工程技术人员参加建陵工程。长津湖畔烈士陵园修建工程自今年八月上旬开工以来，参加这一工程的工兵部队、工程技术人员和有建筑经验的干部共八百二十多人，为了选择依山傍水、风景优美的陵基和洁白而又坚固的碑石，他们常常要走遍很多山岭。在移置烈士遗体的工作中，他们都精细地记载了烈士的姓名、职别、籍贯和埋葬位置，并在每一烈士墓前刻碑志记。陵墓的四周还围着栏杆，并挖掘了宽而深的排水沟。有许多陵墓的周围都栽植了四季常青的松、柏。上甘岭地区烈士陵园门前的纪念碑上，刻着
  “国际之光”四个金色大字。铁原地区的烈士陵园纪念碑上，还刻有挽联和祭文。开城松岳山麓烈士陵园陵门的左侧，建筑了一座花园，右侧利用炸弹坑改筑成一个荷花池。还有些烈士陵园的墓碑上，都醒目地刻着“为抗美援朝而献身的烈士们永垂不朽”的红底金色大字。
    朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜政府、朝鲜人民军和各地人民都十分关怀各地烈士陵园的修建工程。银波郡岐山里的三百多个朝鲜人民为烈士陵园修建了一条七百多公尺长的通道，岐山里小学四百多名师生也自动在陵园周围栽植了一千多棵树苗和大批的花草。咸镜南道人民还特地为在长津湖战役中壮烈牺牲的志愿军特级英雄杨根思烈士修建了一座纪念碑。很多朝鲜人民还按照朝鲜风俗在烈士陵园落成时纷纷赶来瞻仰和祭奠，他们把大批花圈和祭礼，敬献在烈士陵前。
