    Steamer No. 2
    By our reporter Lu Hao

    I rode the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau's Steamer No. 2 south along the Han River. No. 2 towed a clumsy, rectangular iron barge loaded with steel sheet piles of various specifications. These steel sheet piles had been used on the Han River Railway Bridge not long ago and were now being transported to Wusheng Road to supply the Han River Highway Bridge, which was already under construction.
    The Han River Railway Bridge already stands majestically above the turbulent Han River. Its tall, steel structure connects Hankou and Hanyang, which have been separated by the Han River since ancient times. The railway bridge project has been completed. Concrete workers had already poured the concrete slab beams at the Hanyang bridgehead, and track workers had already laid the rails on the black, anti-corrosion sleepers.
    Sailboats coming from Shayang and Yuekou all looked up and admired this magnificent construction when they arrived here. The passenger ships traveling between Hankou and Xiangyang and Fancheng had only seen the steel beams being erected on their last trip; just a few days later, the huge bridge was completely completed. They happily sounded their piercing whistles, which seemed to slightly vibrate the calm river surface in early winter.
    Our Steamer No. 2 also responded with its honest and clumsy voice, as if to jointly celebrate the rapid completion of this long-awaited railway bridge. The green, sharp bow cut the Han River into a deep water pattern, and then pushed the rising and falling waves into the distance. Wooden boats loaded with red bricks, timber, grain, and tung oil were moored along the banks of the Han River. Their dense masts resembled a forest of fallen leaves, and篷 boats with full sails were taking advantage of the wind to go upstream from the Yangtze River, busily shuttling back and forth in this area. After Steamer No. 2 dropped off the iron barge, it sailed past them, exited the Han River, entered the Yangtze River, and headed straight for the Yangtze River Bridge's drilling team.
    At this time, the captain, Wang Quanlin, seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. The helm, which he had almost bent his whole body to turn with all his strength just now, now only needed a few fingers to hold it lightly. Steamer No. 2 cheerfully called out "dudu dudu", and he turned the pointer on the "three-gear" to the "fast" position, and the ship moved forward against the vast and turbulent upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
    I knew that this Captain Wang Quanlin, this young man attracted by the great construction project, had not left Steamer No. 2 for more than a hundred days from the start of the Han River Bridge project in November of last year to the end of the underwater foundation project in May of this year. He had been living on the water in what seemed to others to be a very monotonous life.
    In April 1953, when his superiors called on people to sign up to participate in basic construction, Wang Quanlin was the first to sign up.
    "I don't know if my technical qualifications are good enough?" Wang Quanlin said to his leader, "If I am qualified, I am willing to go anywhere to participate in the construction of the motherland."
    "That's great," the leader said happily, "As long as you are willing to go, we welcome you to sign up."
    Wang Quanlin returned home and told his wife about this. He said, "I am going to participate in the country's basic construction. I don't know when I will leave or where I will go."
    His wife said a little sadly, "We have come a long way from Shanghai to here. Now you are leaving again. If you go far away, I won't be able to see you or hear you. Where will I find you?"
    "You don't need to find me at all. After I settle the family, I will tell you."
    "No." His wife said firmly after considering, "We will go together. Wherever you go, I will go."
    "How can that be? The family will tie us down before the work has even started," he said. "I will send you back to Shanghai first, and then I will write to you every month, and I will send you my salary every month."
    His wife finally listened to him. He sent his wife and two children back from Shanghai. He had originally estimated that he might be assigned to a distant place, but he was assigned to work on the Han River Bridge nearby.
    Since he came to this busy construction site, the No. 2 steamer he drove has been undertaking heavy transportation tasks day and night. There were only seven of them in total, and they could not be divided into day and night shifts for a while. They had to get up and work whenever there was work to do, often sleeping in cotton clothes and not even taking off their shoes. In addition to sending money to his wife once a month and taking a few minutes to go to the post office, Wang Quanlin always asked the sailors to buy cigarettes when they brought vegetables. Although he liked to watch movies very much, the Qiaokou Workers' Cultural Palace was very close to the construction site, and the moving music could be heard very clearly on the ship in the still of the night, he had never been seen there.
    On a cold day, Steamer No. 2 was ordered to go to Parrot Island to tow two batches of bamboo rafts for the construction site. When they arrived at Parrot Island, they saw that the bamboo rafts were more than ten meters long and more than twice as wide as Steamer No. 2 itself. Towing them in two batches would prolong the transportation time. Finally, they decided to tow all the bamboo rafts back at once. From Parrot Island to the mouth of the Han River, this dozen or so kilometers was downstream along the Yangtze River, which was easy to deal with; but once the ship entered the Han River and went upstream, the difficulties increased. The water was rapid and there were many river bends. Steamer No. 2 was no longer as small, exquisite, and obedient as usual. It became clumsy and bloated. By this time it was already dark, gloomy, with no moon and no stars. Steamer No. 2 was coughing and panting laboriously, several times slower than an ox cart, often taking more than an hour to walk from one power pole to another.
    Wang Quanlin stood in front of the helm in the cockpit. The hot air he exhaled condensed into a thin layer of ice on the glass window in front of him. He braved the biting cold wind on the river. In order to look after the bamboo rafts behind him, he simply opened the left window; sometimes, in order to observe the movement on the right, he kicked open the right door of the cockpit with his right foot and looked back. In this pitch-black night, the bamboo rafts were floating horizontally in the middle of the Han River. Wang Quanlin thought that if a wooden boat came down the river and hit the bamboo rafts, it would be a disaster. He immediately told the sailors to bring the charcoal brazier next to him to the back of the bamboo rafts. The charcoal fire was blown by the wind, emitting a flickering light. From a distance, it looked as if a fire was burning on the bamboo rafts.
    Steamer No. 2 was getting slower and slower. When it encountered a rapid current, looking at the markings of the lights on the shore, it often seemed as if it was not moving at all for more than ten minutes. The ship was like a deflated tire, unable to move with all its strength. The water was very rapid, and the bamboo rafts were tossing and turning like shaking in the middle of the river, blocking most of the narrow waterway. If the cable tying the bamboo rafts broke at this time, the bamboo rafts would scatter and block the entire waterway of the Han River, and might even overturn other ships. Wang Quanlin knew that the situation was very serious. He knew that there was a problem with the boiler burning, and he immediately cleverly asked his deputy to watch the helm for him, and he hurried down the iron ladder to the lower cabin boiler room. The stoker was anxious. The coal was not good, and the furnace was dark and muddled, and the fire was groaning weakly. The worse the fire was, the more anxious the stoker was, and the more anxious he was, the worse the fire burned. Wang Quanlin had been a stoker before, so he would come up to steer Steamer No. 2 forward for a while; and then go down to help with the fire. Slowly the fire became stronger, and the steam became more sufficient, and the small fire wheel gradually moved forward. The bamboo rafts were towed to the Han River Railway Bridge, it was already past 11 o'clock at night. And the many floating cranes, iron barges, and wooden boats on the construction site were anxiously waiting for it to be dispatched.
    During this busy and tense time, Wuhan's literary and art workers often came to the construction site to hold慰问 performances for the builders of the Han River Railway Bridge. Once, the construction site was holding an evening party, and Steamer No. 2 happened to have no work to do for the time being. He asked the people on the ship to go to the theater, but he stayed to guard the ship.
    In this seemingly narrow deck, Wang Quanlin cleaned the steel and hemp cables piled on the bow of the ship one by one, and then he carefully scrubbed his entire body with a mop. On Steamer No. 2, the only spacious place was the upper cabin connected to the cockpit painted in light green paint. In addition to the place where the captain worked, there were also a few long chairs with crimson backrests, and a small table that was usually used by three or four people to eat, play poker, or play chess. In addition, there were only aisles that could accommodate one person on both sides and a stern that could accommodate two or three people working. Although the place was so small, Wang Quanlin had a deep feeling for Steamer No. 2, and he washed everything here bit by bit.
    At this time, the branch secretary of the water work area came to his ship. The branch secretary saw that Wang Quanlin had not gone ashore and asked:
    "Why didn't you go to the theater today?"
    Wang Quanlin pointed to the hull of Steamer No. 2, and he said meaningfully:
    "It just won't let me go."
    "Do you want to watch it?" the branch secretary asked as if on purpose.
    "Of course I do," he replied affirmatively. "But, you see, our spotlight in the water work area is also very good-looking." He continued, "Everyone is working hard in the lights, and the broadcaster on the shore is still playing music, which is not worse than an evening party!"
    Tonight, probably because the branch secretary deliberately wanted to attract him to go ashore, he said with a teasing tone, "Do you know? Today's performance is 'Forty Years of Wish'."
    Wang Quanlin held the mop in his hand, and he put it in the river to wash it for a while; and then he dried it and scrubbed the deck on the bow of the ship. He seemed completely indifferent to the branch secretary's meaning. He said thoughtfully, "The people of Wuhan have also had a wish for this Han River Railway Bridge for at least several decades."
    In the spring of 1954, it was the most tense time for the underwater foundation project of the Han River Bridge. Wang Quanlin's wife returned from Shanghai to Wuhan to see him at this time. She first went to the place where they used to live in Wuchang and asked someone to bring a message to her husband, saying that she had arrived.
    Two days later, his wife still did not see him cross the river to see her. She couldn't help it and came to the construction site of the Han River Bridge with her children.
    Steamer No. 2 had just finished a job, and a new job had not started yet. Someone told him that his wife had arrived, so he ran ashore to pick her up. He didn't care about saying anything and stretched out his hands to hug his son.
    "Don't you want me anymore?" His wife complained with jealousy, "I see that you only want your children."
    Wang Quanlin smiled and said, "How can I not want you? I want you, and I want our children, I want all of them."
    "Your heart is too hard. I have been here for two days, why can't you come to see me."
    "I really don't have time. If you live here with me for two days, you will know whether I am really busy or just pretending to be busy."
    He settled his family in the berth in the head cabin. After his wife had only lived here for a few days, she completely believed that what her husband said was completely true.
    Because she saw that he didn't have time to drink water, she often helped him pour tea, making it not too hot or too cold, and put it in front of his helm. Sometimes in the dusk or dawn, when the weather was cold, he didn't even have time to put on his clothes. At this time, his wife would take his clothes and put them on him. Once, he was sick and it was really rare for him to go ashore once and go to the health station. The doctor decided to give him an injection. The nurse prepared the medicine and happened to hear that Steamer No. 2 was about to send the people on the construction site to the No. 5 bridge pier to Hanyang. When he heard this, he immediately set off to leave. The nurse said, "The medicine is ready, get the injection before you leave."
    "No. I'll get it when I come back, anyway, the medicine won't spoil," he said as he put on his coat and walked out.
    The nurse comrade showed a helpless expression. She sighed and said, "There's really no way to deal with you, why don't you listen to a word."
    It wasn't until the next day that Wang Quanlin was driven back to the health station by his comrades.
    I know that all of this happened to this young captain beside me. His two slightly sunken eyes, covered by thick eyebrows, are now focused on looking straight ahead. Although the two wrinkles between his eyebrows that often appear due to the tension of work have now disappeared, I can still see the strong and unusual light emitted from his eyes at any time. At this time, I was standing on the aisle of Steamer No. 2, and the waves of the turbulent Yangtze River splashed onto the deck one after another. On our right, the three-story red brick dormitory newly built for the builders of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, how young and beautiful it dresses up the ancient Hanyang; on the left front of the ship, the famous Yellow Crane Tower stands beside the Yangtze River. Not far from it, you can see the towering drilling rigs on the barges, which are probing the underwater data for the future No. 7 bridge pier of the Yangtze River Bridge. I know that although the great construction has just begun, the mood of the builders of the Yangtze River Bridge is as boiling as the vast and magnificent river surface.

    第二号轮船
    本报记者  陆灏
    我乘着武汉大桥工程局第二号轮船顺着汉水南行。二号轮拖着一只长方形的笨头笨脑的铁驳，它满载着几种规格不同的钢板桩。这些钢板桩不久以前是在汉水铁桥用过的，现在是运到武圣路供给已经开工的汉水公路桥使用。
    汉水铁桥已经巍峨地屹立在湍急的汉水之上。它的高大的钢铁的躯体，把自古就被汉水分割的汉口和汉阳连接在一起了。铁桥的工程已经完成。混凝土工人早把汉阳桥头的混凝土板梁浇灌完毕，钉道工人在黑色的防腐枕木上面已把铁轨铺好了。
    从沙洋、岳口开来的帆船到了这里，水手们都昂头赞叹这宏伟的建设。往返在汉口和襄阳、樊城之间的客轮，他们上一班经过这里的时候，钢梁才架好不久，仅仅是几天以后，巨大的桥梁已经全部竣工了。它们高兴地鸣叫着刺耳的汽笛，把这初冬的平静的河面都好像微微震动了。
    我们这只二号轮，也用它憨声憨气的嗓门呼应着，仿佛是为了表示共同庆贺这盼望已久的铁桥迅速完成。绿色的尖削的船头把汉水划成一道深深的水纹，然后又把一起一落的波浪推向远处。汉水两岸停泊着满载红砖、木材、粮食和桐油的木船，它们密密的桅杆像落叶的树林一般，扯着满帆的篷船正借助风力从长江进来逆水而上，活跃在这一带渡口的划着双桨的小划子匆忙地穿梭般地来往。二号轮放下铁驳以后，就驶过它们，出了汉水进入长江，直向长江大桥的钻探队驶去。
    这时候，轮长王泉林好像刚刚松了一口气，方才有时候几乎要倾斜着身体用全身力量扳动的舵盘，现在只要几个手指轻轻地把着它了。二号轮嘟嘟嘟地快活地叫喊着，他把“三摆”上的指针拨在
  “快”字上面，这船就迎着浩瀚的奔腾的长江上游破浪前进。
    我知道就是这位轮长王泉林，就是这位为伟大的建设工程所吸引的年青人，他从去年十一月汉水桥的工程开工以后，一直到今年五月水下基础工程结束，一百多天的日子，他就一直没有离开过这只二号轮，一直就在这水上过着在旁人看起来是十分单调的生活。
    在一九五三年的四月，当他的上级号召人们报名参加基本建设的时候，王泉林是第一个报名的人。
    “不知道我的技术条件够格不够格？”王泉林向他的领导同志这样说：“如果够格，随便到那里去参加祖国的建设，我都愿意去。”
    “那很好，”领导同志欣然地说：“只要你愿意去，我们欢迎你报名。”
    王泉林回到家里，他把这件事情告诉了他的妻子。他说：“我要参加国家的基本建设去了。什么时候走，走到那里去，现在还不知道。”
    他的妻子有点忧郁地说：“我们从上海到这里，已经离家很远了。现在你又要走了，要是走得很远，我看你不到，喊你不见，我到那里去找你呀。”
    “你根本用不着找我，我把家安置好后，会告诉你的。”
    “不行。”他的妻子考虑以后坚决地说：“要走一块走。你到那里，我也到那里。”
    “那怎么可以呢？工作还没有开始，家庭就把咱们累住了。”他说：“我先送你回上海去，以后，我每个月给你写信，每个月我把工资寄给你。”
    他的妻子最后终于听从了他。他送了妻子和两个孩子从上海回来，本来估计可能被分派到远处去的，结果却就被分派在附近的汉水桥工作。
    自从他来到这个紧张的工地，他所驾驶的二号轮就日日夜夜担负着繁重的运输任务。他们一共只有七个人，一时无法分日夜班，只好什么时候有工作，什么时候就起来做，常常穿着棉衣睡觉，连鞋也不能脱。王泉林除了每月给妻子寄一次钱，花几分钟上一趟邮局以外，平常抽烟也总是托水手们买菜带来的。他虽然很喜欢看电影，礄口工人文化宫离工地也很近，夜深人静的时候，动人的音乐可以很清晰地传到船上来，但那里从来也没有见过他的人影。
    在一个寒冷的日子里，二号轮奉命去鹦鹉洲为工地拖两批竹筏。他们到了鹦鹉洲，一看这竹筏有十几公尺长，宽度比二号轮本身还宽出一倍多。分两批拖，要延长运输时间，最后他们决定把全部竹筏一次拖回来。从鹦鹉洲到汉水口上，这十几里路，是顺着长江的水走，还好对付；但轮船一进汉水，逆流而上，困难就多了。水急，河湾多，二号轮不像平常那样小巧玲珑听话了，它变得又笨又臃肿。这时天已经大黑，阴沉沉地，没有月亮，也没有星星。二号轮吃力地吭嗤吭嗤地走着，比牛车还慢好几倍，往往从这一根电线杆走到另外一根电线杆，要走一个多钟头。
    王泉林立在驾驶室的舵盘前，他嘴里吐出来的热气，一会儿就在他面前的玻璃窗上结成一层薄冰。他冒着河面上的刺骨的冷风，为了看顾后面的竹筏，干脆把左面的窗子打开；有时为了观察右面的动静，他又用右脚踢开驾驶室的右门向后了望。在这漆黑的夜里，竹筏是这样宽宽地横浮在汉水当中，王泉林想到要是有条木船顺水下来撞上了竹筏，这就要闯大祸了。他马上告诉水手们，把他旁边烤手的木炭风炉端到后边竹筏上去。木炭火被风吹着，发出一闪一闪的火光，远处看来，好像在竹筏上烧起了一堆火一样。
    二号轮越来越慢，碰上一股急流，看着岸上灯光的记号，常常十几分钟就好像一动也不动似的。轮船像漏了气，全身软绵绵地走不动了。水势很急，竹筏横在河当中，像发抖似地颠簸着，它把不宽的航道堵了一大半。要是这时候捆竹筏的缆绳出了毛病，竹筏一散，就会把整个汉水的航道堵塞，说不定还会打翻别的船只。王泉林知道情况很严重，他懂得这是锅炉房烧火发生问题了，马上机灵地让副手帮他看着舵盘，自己就急忙顺着铁梯到下舱锅炉房去。司炉正在着急，煤不好，炉子里黑糊糊的，火无力地呻吟着。火越不好，司炉越着急，越着急，火越烧不好。王泉林当过司炉，他于是一会儿上来掌握二号轮前进；一会儿下去帮着烧火。慢慢火就旺了些，蒸汽也就足了些，小火轮就渐渐地向前移动了。竹筏拖到汉水铁桥，已经是夜间十一点多了。而工地上众多的吊船、铁驳、木船又正焦急地等待着它来调动。
    在这忙碌的紧张的时候，武汉市的文艺工作者经常到工地上来为汉水铁桥的建设者们举行慰问演出。有一次，工地正举行晚会，二号轮恰巧暂时没有工作，他让船上的人都去看戏，自己却留下来看管船只。
    就在这看起来甚为狭窄的舱面上，王泉林一件一件清理着满堆在船头上的钢丝的、麻的缆绳，然后，他用墩布细心地擦洗着它的全身。在二号轮上要算唯一宽敞的地方，就是那和涂着浅绿色油漆的驾驶室连在一起的上舱。这里除了轮长工作的地方以外，还有几张朱红色靠背的长椅子，一张平常供三四个人吃饭或打扑克下棋的小桌子。除此以外，两边只有能走一个人的过道和一个可供两三个人工作的船尾。地方虽然是这样的小，但王泉林却怀着对二号轮深厚的情感，他把这里一点一点地都洗刷得干干净净。
    正在这时候，水上工区的支部书记来到了他的船上。支部书记见王泉林没有上岸。就问：
    “你怎么今天还是没有去看戏？”
    王泉林指着二号轮的船身，他有意思地说：
  “就是它不放我去。”
      “想不想看？”支部书记好像故意问。
    “当然想。”他肯定地回答说：“可是，你来看看我们这水上工区的聚光灯底下也是很好看的呢。”他继续说：“大家都在灯光里紧张地工作，岸上的广播器还奏着音乐，这比晚会并不差呀！”
    今天晚上，大约是支部书记故意想吸引他到岸上去，便带着挑逗的口气说：“你知道吗？今天是上演‘四十年的愿望’呢。”
    王泉林手里拿着的那个墩布，他一会儿放它到河水里去洗濯；一会儿又弄干它擦洗船头上的甲板，他好像对支部书记这番意思根本无动于衷。他若有所思地说：“武汉人民对于这汉水铁桥也至少抱有几十年的愿望了。”
    一九五四年的春天，正是汉水桥水下基础工程最紧张的日子。王泉林的妻子这时候从上海回到武汉来看他。她先到了武昌他们原来住过的地方，托便人给她的丈夫带了一个口信，说她已经到了。
    过了两天，他的妻子仍旧不见他渡江来看她。她忍不住了，带着孩子，来到了汉水桥的工地。
    二号轮刚刚结束了一个工作，而新的工作暂时还没有开始，别人给他说他的妻子来了，他就跑上岸来接她，他什么话也顾不得说，就张开双手去抱自己的儿子。
    “你是不是不要我了。”他的妻子带着嫉妒的心情埋怨说：“我看你只要你的孩子就可以了。”
    王泉林微笑着说：“怎么能不要你呢。要你，也要我们的孩子，全都要。”
   “你的心肠太硬了。我已经来了两天，你为什么不能来看一看我。”
   “我实在没有时间。你在我这里住上两天，你就知道我是真的忙还是假的忙。”
    他在头舱里的铺位上安置了他的家庭。当他的妻子在这里仅仅住上几天以后，她就完全相信她丈夫所说的话是完全真实的了。
    因为看他没有时间喝水，她就常常帮他把茶倒好，弄得不凉不热，放在他的舵盘的跟前。有时在黄昏或者黎明，天气凉了，他连衣裳也来不及穿。这时候，他的妻子就把他的衣裳拿来披在他的身上。有一次，他生了病，真是难得算上了一次岸，到了保健站。医生决定给他打针，护士把药准备好，正巧听说二号轮马上要去送工地上的人过五号桥墩到汉阳去。他知道后，立即动身要走，护士说：“药已经准备好了，打了针再走吧。”
    “不行。回来再打吧，反正药坏不了。”他一面说，一面便穿好上衣往外走。
    护士同志露出一种无可奈何的表情。她叹了一口气，说：“对你这个人真没有办法，你怎么一句话也不肯听。”
    一直到了第二天，王泉林才被同志们撵回保健站。
    我知道这一切事情就是发生在我身旁的这位年青的轮长的身上，他的为浓眉罩盖着的两只微微凹进去的眼睛，现在正集中地正视着前面，虽然是眉毛之间因为工作紧张而常常显现的两道皱纹现在已经消失，但从他的眼睛里面仍然随时可以看到发射出来的那种坚强的不平常的光芒。这时候，我站在二号轮的过道上，滔滔的长江的浪花前起后涌地溅到甲板上来。在我们的右面，那为武汉长江大桥建设者们新建的三层楼的红砖宿舍，把古老的汉阳装扮得多么年青和漂亮；在船的左前方，著名的黄鹤楼矗立在长江的身旁，在离它不远的地方，可以看到趸船上的高耸的钻机，正为未来的长江大桥第七号桥墩探测水底资料。我知道虽然是伟大的建设刚刚开始，但长江大桥的建设者们的心情和这波澜壮阔的江面一样，已经沸腾起来了。
