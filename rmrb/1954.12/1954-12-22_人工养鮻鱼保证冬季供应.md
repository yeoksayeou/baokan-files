    Artificial Mullet Farming Guarantees Winter Supply
    The Dongsheng Fisheries Production Cooperative in the Seventh District of Jin County, Liaoning Province, has achieved preliminary success in artificial mullet farming after more than a year of experimentation.
    In the past, mullet could not be caught in winter, and city dwellers could not eat fresh mullet during the winter months. Last year, the Dongsheng Fisheries Production Cooperative brought in some small mullet, and some cooperative members said, "Farmers can find ways to supply fresh vegetables to the city in winter, and we should also find ways to raise these small fish and supply them to the city in winter!" The cooperative adopted this suggestion, digging two-meter-deep ponds on the edge of the coastal tidelands and releasing five catties of small live mullet into them. By winter, the five catties of fish had grown to thirty catties. Based on this experience, this autumn, the cooperative expanded the fish ponds and put in three thousand catties of small mullet for artificial rearing. These three thousand catties of small fish will soon grow to fifteen thousand catties, to supply the people of the city.

    人工养鮻鱼保证冬季供应
    辽宁省金县七区东升渔业生产合作社，经过一年多的试验，人工饲养鮻鱼已经初步得到成功。
    过去每到冬季就不能捕捉鮻鱼，城市人民在冬季里也就不能吃到新鲜鮻鱼。去年，东升渔业生产合作社曾拉了一些小鮻鱼，有些社员就说：“农民能想办法在冬季里向城市供应新鲜蔬菜，我们也应当想办法饲养这些小鱼，到冬季供给城市！”社里采纳了这一建议，在海岸的甸子边挖了两公尺深的水池子，把五斤小活鮻鱼放了进去。到冬天，五斤鱼长成了三十斤。根据这一经验，今年秋季，该社扩大了鱼池，放进三千斤小鮻鱼，进行人工饲养。这三千斤小鱼不久就可以长到一万五千斤，供给城市人民。
