    Radford to Go to Taiwan to Conspire with Chiang Kai-shek on Implementing the US-Chiang Treaty
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 19th] Western news agencies report that Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, will go to Taiwan at the end of December to confer with Chiang Kai-shek on specific measures for implementing the US-Chiang treaty. US Foreign Operations Administrator Stassen and US Seventh Fleet Commander Pride will also rush to Taiwan to attend the meeting.
    The content of this meeting, as revealed by foreign news agencies, indicates that Radford's mission to Taiwan is to strengthen the US military occupation of Taiwan and to plan the expansion of military aggression against China from there, including the formulation of a plan for mutual coordination between US and Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Sources say that Radford will also conspire with Chiang Kai-shek to expand the scope of direct US military occupation.
    At the same time, Radford will also arrange to expand and strengthen the military strength of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, strengthening their harassment and threats against mainland China. According to Agence France-Presse, Radford will present "concrete opinions" to Chiang Kai-shek, explaining "how to intensify weapons assistance and training of Kuomintang armed personnel in the most effective way at present."
    As everyone knows, Radford is one of the key figures in the US war-mongering clique, resolutely hostile to China and the people of Asia. He has openly advocated the permanent US occupation of Taiwan as an aggressive base for aggression against China and Asia, and advocated giving Chiang Kai-shek a large amount of military aid, using him to expand aggression against China. He also presumptuously advocated that the United States directly participate in the war against the Chinese people and bomb the Chinese mainland. The US authorities' dispatch of Radford to Taiwan this time precisely shows that, under the guise of the so-called "defense" treaty, it is actively carrying out war deployments to expand military aggression against China.

    雷德福将到台湾同蒋贼策划实施美蒋条约
    【新华社十九日讯】据西方通讯社报道，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福将在十二月底到台湾去，同蒋介石会商实施美蒋条约的具体办法。美国援外事务管理署署长史塔生和美国第七舰队司令普赖德也将赶到台湾去出席这次会议。
    从外国通讯社透露出来的这次会议将要讨论的内容可以看出，雷德福这次到台湾去的任务是，加强美国对台湾的军事占领，并且策划从那里扩大对中国的军事侵略，包括拟订一项美蒋军队互相配合的计划。有消息说，雷德福还将同蒋贼策划扩大美国直接实行军事侵占的范围。
    同时，雷德福也将安排扩大和加强蒋贼军的军事力量，加强它对中国大陆的骚扰和威胁。据法新社报道，雷德福将向蒋贼提出“具体的意见”，说明“目前怎样最能加紧武器援助，加紧进行对国民党武装人员的训练”。
    大家知道，雷德福是坚决同中国和亚洲人民为敌的美国好战集团的要?之一。他曾公开主张美国永久侵占台湾作为侵略中国和亚洲的侵略基地，并且主张给予蒋贼大量的军事援助，利用它来扩大对中国的侵略。他还狂妄主张美国直接参加反对中国人民的战争，轰炸中国大陆。美国当局这次派遣雷德福到台湾去，正好说明，它在所谓“防御”条约的掩盖之下，正在积极进行扩大对中国的军事侵略的战争部署。
