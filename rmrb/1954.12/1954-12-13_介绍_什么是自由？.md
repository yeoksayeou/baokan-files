Introducing "What is Freedom?"
By Yu Fan
Written by Roger Garaudy, Translated by Ling Qihan, Published by Sanlian Bookstore

Roger Garaudy is a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. He has written many books and is best at discussing philosophical issues in a lively and fluent style. In May of this year, Garaudy submitted a paper entitled "The Question of Freedom" to the Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Moscow. After being evaluated by the examination committee, he was awarded a doctorate in philosophy from the Soviet Union.

This book analyzes the concept of freedom from a Marxist-Leninist viewpoint. The author begins by using many vivid examples to expose the truth about "freedom" in the so-called "free world" constantly touted by the bourgeoisie. He points out that in capitalist society, freedom is a class privilege for the exploiting class; while for the exploited class, freedom takes the form of enslavement. In such a society, there can be no real freedom.

Afterward, the author follows the various stages of social development to describe the development of "freedom." He points out that "from the beginning, the history of freedom has been intertwined with the history of class oppression" (page 44 of the book). In the primitive commune period, mankind was a slave to nature, and the content of freedom was very poor, but it was still genuine freedom. In the slavery period, freedom became a class privilege. The freedom of a few "free citizens" was built on the enslavement of the vast majority of people. In the feudal period, a few aristocratic landlords enjoyed "freedom," while the majority of serfs suffered enslavement. In the capitalist period, in legal form, capitalists who control the means of production and proletarians who have only labor to sell are in the same position. In reality, capitalists have the freedom to exploit and get rich, while laborers only have the freedom to be unemployed and starve. Of course, the true content of freedom varies in the periods of primitive accumulation, manufacturing, the industrial revolution, and imperialism. In its ascendant phase, the bourgeoisie, with the support of the working people, raised the banner of freedom, overthrew the feudal system, and liberated the productive forces, demonstrating a certain progressive significance. However, after the bourgeoisie came to power, they kicked the working people aside and usurped the name of demanding freedom for all the people to enslave them. In the era of imperialism, in order to pursue maximum profits, monopoly capital did not hesitate to throw aside the banner of "freedom," bringing unemployment, bankruptcy, crises, colonial plunder, and wars to all mankind, and these misfortunes in turn promoted the collapse of capitalism.

From this, it can be seen that "in class society, freedom belongs only to those who own the means of production." "In feudal society, the condition for the bourgeoisie to obtain freedom is the abolition of the feudal system"; and "in capitalist society, the condition for the working class to obtain freedom is the abolition of capitalism" (page 60 of the book). As Stalin said in his speech at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "The banner of bourgeois democratic freedom has been thrown aside. I believe that it is you, the representatives of the communist and democratic parties, who must raise this banner and move forward under this banner."

Next, the author outlines the struggles made by progressive thinkers since the nineteenth century against the bourgeois lies of freedom. He writes that "freedom" built on the basis of ownership was the target of attacks by a series of utopian socialists in the nineteenth century. For example, Fourier pointed out that the real name of this freedom is "capitalist anarchy." Considérant pointed out, "As long as the people have not won welfare, freedom will always be a meaningless empty word." Blanqui pointed out, "The freedom of those who live in luxury devours those who live in hardship. The big companies and their gradual encroachment finally eliminate all middle classes and leave only two kinds of people: masters or capitalists, slaves or laborers." (pages 66-74 of the book)

However, utopian socialists only attacked the bourgeoisie's "freedom" in a negative way and failed to discover the power of the proletariat to strive for freedom in a positive way. Marxism, by applying the method of studying problems from a class perspective, thoroughly elucidated the issue of freedom, giving freedom a positive content. Marxism believes that freedom "is a real power to control nature, to control social life, and to control oneself" (page 76 of the book). The bourgeoisie falsely calls its cannibalistic world a "free world" and even far-fetchedly insists that socialist and people's democratic countries obliterate freedom of thought and freedom of literary and artistic creation. This lie of the bourgeoisie is most likely to touch the wavering intellectuals in capitalist society. Here, the author says with an enthusiastic tone: there are two roads unfolding before intellectuals. One is the road of "‘dependence’ on the bourgeoisie and its demands." The other is the road of "‘dependence’ on the people and their needs, and proudly declaring this ‘dependence’." An increasing number of intellectuals have chosen the latter path, and they proudly declare: "We are warriors of the working class." (pages 83-84 of the book)

The above words are also very close to the hearts of our country's intellectuals. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us long ago to face the masses of the people and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Recently, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China," profoundly analyzed the class status of intellectuals and pointed out: "Except for a very small number of intellectuals who persist in their reactionary stance and engage in activities against the People's Republic of China, our country must pay attention to uniting all intellectuals, helping them to carry out ideological transformation, and giving full play to their abilities so that they can serve the cause of socialist construction."

When we read Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's words of great care for intellectuals, and compare them with the author's words quoted above, we should not only muster the courage to declare that we are intellectuals who are "dependent on the people," but also strive further to become "warriors of the working class" and faithfully serve the cause of socialist construction to the end.

In the third chapter of the book, the author describes the process of the development of bourgeois thought on the issue of freedom and criticizes the erroneous viewpoints of theology, idealism, mechanical materialism, dualism, and physical idealism, etc. However, as Comrade Konstantinov pointed out in the preface to the Russian translation, this chapter of the book has some shortcomings, for example, regarding mechanical materialism as a "special fantasy of the ruling class," and saying that the contradiction between the social nature of production and private ownership is the root of the dualism of matter and spirit, and so on. Despite this, this chapter still has its incisive parts, which mainly lie in the fact that the author correctly arranges the concept of freedom on the basis of materialist epistemology. He points out that "the fundamental error of various bourgeois theories of freedom lies in their separating consciousness from the world that produces consciousness... The question of freedom can only be resolved by ‘resetting philosophy on its footing,’ that is, only by reconstructing the real relationship between consciousness, action, and matter." (page 105 of the book)

The author argues for the proposition that "freedom is the recognition of necessity."

"1. Materialist epistemology teaches us that the laws of nature, the necessity of nature, exist independently outside of us. Our freedom is based on this recognition; 2. Human knowledge and will are only derived from this fundamental reality, and are secondary products. Therefore, human knowledge and will must conform to the necessity of nature;
3. Outside of us, there is also necessity that we have not recognized. These necessities are blind, therefore, these necessities cause enslavement to people…
4. Our freedom, through conscious practice, through labor to transform nature, is combined with necessity." (pages 108-109 of the book)

Idealists oppose freedom and necessity, deny the objective laws of nature, and regard freedom and necessity as opposing and mutually exclusive things. Therefore, the author, according to Engels' famous saying in "Anti-Dühring" that explains "the unity of necessity and freedom," points out: "Freedom does not consist in the so-called ‘independence’ from the laws of nature, but in the knowledge of these laws, in how these laws can be utilized in practical activities... When people are ignorant of necessity, they are slaves to necessity. When people recognize necessity, they learn how to master it. Freedom is only possible on the basis of recognizing necessity" (page 110 of the book).

In the fourth chapter, the author explores the relationship between the state, class, and freedom.

The more human power to control nature expands, the more the scope of freedom expands. But people cannot be independent from society. When society is divided into antagonistic classes, freedom becomes the privilege of the exploiting class. There is no such thing as general "freedom." The state guarantees the freedom of one class and the enslavement of another, so the existence of the state is inseparable from the existence of classes. To make freedom true freedom, as the author says: "First, one must stand on one's own fighting position in the class struggle and serve the class that bears the historical mission of ending class antagonism and the system of human exploitation through the dictatorship of the proletariat" (pages 137-138 of the book).

The Communist Party is the party of the working class, which bears the historical mission of ending class antagonism and eliminating the system of exploitation. Only this party can make us truly free people.

Here, the author also emphasizes that in order to accomplish the arduous task of liberating the world, the Communist Party must enforce strict discipline. Intellectuals often find it difficult to understand the discipline of the Communist Party. Some people think that discipline and freedom are mutually opposed and mutually exclusive. They even say: "We are afraid of discipline, we need freedom; the Communist Party is good in every way, but it has no freedom, especially individual freedom; in order to choose freedom, we would rather avoid discipline." In response to this erroneous thinking, the author gives us a convincing explanation: "This is not enslaved obedience, but scientific discipline. An engineer cannot build a bridge according to his own wishes. He must have sufficient materials, be in a specific location, and meet specific needs before he can build. These are the strict conditions necessary for correctly solving the problem, and there can be no negligence in the implementation. This is a necessary condition to make the project effective" (page 143 of the book).

From this, it can be seen that laxity and unruliness are the enemies of "freedom"; and discipline—conscious, scientific discipline—is the foundation for producing true freedom. The author says: "The day we join the Party is the beginning of our freedom." This is indeed the most powerful and most brilliant sentence.

In this book, the author reveals the true face of bourgeois freedom and points out that only the Communist Party is the true warrior who liberates the masses from capitalist enslavement. After reading this book, we will surely understand that our country is steadily moving towards the "leap from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom" (Engels, "Anti-Dühring") as Engels said.

    介绍“什么是自由？”
    于蕃
    法国  茄罗蒂著　凌其翰译  三联书店出版
    罗齐·茄罗蒂是法共中央委员。他的著作很多，他最善于用生动流畅的笔调，谈论哲学问题。今年五月间，茄罗蒂向莫斯科苏联科学院哲学研究所提出了一篇题为“自由问题”的论文，经考试委员会评定，获得了苏联哲学博士学位。
    本书是用马克思列宁主义的观点来分析自由的概念的。著者首先用很多生动的事例，揭露资产阶级不断吹嘘的所谓“自由世界”内“自由”的真相。他指出：在资本主义社会里，对于剥削阶级，自由是一种阶级特权；而对于被剥削阶级，自由则形成为奴役。在这种社会里，是不可能有真正的自由的。
    以后，著者循着社会发展史的各个阶段来叙述“自由”的发展。他指出“从开始起，自由的历史就和阶级压迫的历史结合在一起”（本书四四页）。在原始公社时期，人类是自然的奴隶，自由的内容很贫乏，但仍不失为真正的自由。到了奴隶制时期，自由就成为阶级的特权。少数“自由公民”的自由建筑在对绝大多数人的奴役上面。在封建时期，少数贵族地主享受“自由”，而大多数农奴则遭受奴役。在资本主义时期，在法律的形式上，掌握生产资料的资本家和只有劳力可供出卖的无产者处于同样的地位，实则资本家有剥削、致富的自由，而劳动者只有失业、饿死的自由。当然，自由的真实内容在原始积累时期、工场手工业时期、工业革命时期和帝国主义时期有所不同。资产阶级在上升时期，由于获得了劳动人民的支持，才举起自由的旗帜，推翻了封建制度，解放了生产力，表现了一定的进步意义；但资产阶级当权后，就把劳动人民一脚踢开，并盗用为全体人民要求自由的名义，来奴役人民。到了帝国主义时期，垄断资本为了追求最大限度的利润，不惜把“自由”的旗帜抛在一边，给全人类带来了失业、破产、危机、殖民地掠夺和战争等厄运，而这些厄运也反转来促使资本主义的崩溃。
    由此可见，“在阶级社会中，自由仅属于占有生产资料的人们。”“在封建社会中，资产阶级获得自由的条件就是封建制度的废除”；而“在资本主义社会中，工人阶级获得自由的条件就是资本主义的废除”。（本书第六○页）正如斯大林在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的演说中所说：“资产阶级民主的自由这面旗帜已经被抛在一边了。我认为，正是你们，共产主义和民主的政党的代表们，必须举起这面旗帜，打着这面旗帜前进。”
    接着，著者概述了十九世纪以来进步思想家对资产阶级的自由谎言所作的斗争。他写道：建筑在所有权基础上的“自由”是十九世纪一系列空想社会主义者抨击的目标。例如，傅立叶指出，这种自由的真实名称乃是“资本主义的无政府状态”。孔西台朗指出，“只要人民没有争取到福利，自由始终是一句没有意义的空话”。勃朗基指出，“过着豪华生活的人们的自由吞食了生活困苦的人们。大公司和其渐进的侵吞终于消灭一切中等阶级而只剩下两种人：主人或资本家，奴隶或劳动者。”（本书第六六—七四页）
    然而，空想社会主义者只在消极方面抨击资产阶级的“自由”，而未能在积极方面发掘无产阶级争取自由的力量。马克思主义应用了以阶级观点来研究问题的方法，才彻底阐明了自由的问题，给予自由以积极的内容。马克思主义认为，自由“是一种控制自然，控制社会生活，控制一个人自己的实在权力”（本书第七六页）。资产阶级把自己吃人的世界妄称为“自由世界”，还牵强附会地硬说社会主义和人民民主国家抹煞思想自由、文艺创作的自由。资产阶级这种谎话最容易打动资本主义社会里充满着动摇性的知识分子。在这里，著者带着热情的笔调说：展开在知识分子面前的有两条道路。一条是“‘依附’于资产阶级和它的要求的”道路。另一条是“‘依附’人民和他们的需要，并骄傲地宣布这个‘依附’”的道路。日益增多的知识分子选择了后一条道路，他们自豪地宣布：“我们是工人阶级的战士”。（本书第八三—八四页）
    以上这些话对于我国的知识分子同样是非常亲切的。毛泽东同志早就教导我们要面向人民大众，要为工农兵服务。最近，刘少奇同志在“关于中华人民共和国宪法草案报告”中深刻地分析了知识分子的阶级地位，并指出：“除开极少数坚持反动立场并进行反对中华人民共和国活动的知识分子以外，我们的国家必须注意团结一切知识分子，帮助他们进行思想改造，发挥他们的能力，使他们为社会主义的建设事业服务。”
    我们把毛泽东同志和刘少奇同志这些对知识分子爱护备至的话和上面所引著者的话参照阅读，不仅应该鼓起勇气来宣布我们是“依附人民”的知识分子，还须进一步努力争取使自己成为“工人阶级的战士”，为社会主义的建设事业忠诚服务到底。
    在本书第三章中，著者叙述了在自由问题上资产阶级思想发展的过程，并批判了神学、唯心论、机械唯物论、二元论和物理学唯心论等等错误的观点。但是，正如康士坦丁诺夫同志在俄译本序中指出的，本书的这一章有一些缺点，例如，把机械唯物论看作是“统治阶级的特殊幻想”，把生产的社会性和私有制间的矛盾说成是物质和精神二元论的根源，等等。虽然如此，本章仍有它的精辟部分，这主要地就是著者把自由的概念正确地安排在唯物主义认识论的基础上。他指出：“资产阶级各种关于自由的理论的根本错误在于它们把意识从产生意识的世界中分离出来……自由的问题只有在‘把哲学重新安置在它的立脚点上’才能解决，也就是说，只有重建意识、行动和物质间的真实关系才能解决。”（本书第一○五页）
    著者论证了“自由是认识到的必然性”这一命题。
      “一、唯物论的认识论教导我们，自然界的法则，自然界的必然性是独立地存在于我们之外的。我们的自由就在这种认识上得到了依据；二、人的认识和意志只不过是从这个根本现实所派生出来的东西，是第二性的产物。所以，人类的认识和意志必须适合自然界的必然性；
    三、在我们之外，还存在着我们所没有认识的必然性。这些必然性是盲目的，因此，这些必然性就造成对人的奴役。……
    四、我们的自由，通过自觉的实践，通过改造自然的劳动，就跟必然性结合到一起了。”（本书第一○八—一○九页）
    唯心主义者把自由和必然性对立起来，否认自然界的客观法则，把自由和必然性看作是对立的互相排斥的东西。因此，著者根据恩格斯在“反杜林论”中说明“必然与自由的统一”的名言，指出：“自由不是在于对自然法则的所谓‘独立’，而是在于这些法则的认识，在于实践活动中如何能够利用这些法则。……当人对必然性茫然无知的时候，就是必然性的奴隶。当人认识必然性时，就学习怎样掌握它。自由只有在认识必然性的基础上才有可能”（本书第一一○页）。
    在第四章中，著者探讨了国家、阶级同自由的关系。
    人控制自然的权力愈扩大，则自由的范围也跟着扩大，但人不能离开社会而独立，当社会划分为对抗阶级的时候，自由就成为剥削阶级的特权。一般的“自由”是没有的。国家保证一个阶级的自由和另一个阶级的被奴役，所以国家的存在和阶级的存在是分不开的。要使自由成为真正的自由，正如著者所说：“首先必须在阶级斗争中，站在自己战斗的岗位上，为负有通过无产阶级专政、结束阶级对抗和人剥削人制度的历史使命的阶级服务”（本书第一三七—一三八页）。
    共产党就是负有结束阶级对抗和消灭剥削制度的历史使命的阶级——工人阶级的党。只有这个党能使我们成为真正自由的人。
    这里，著者还着重指出，共产党为了要完成解放世界的艰巨事业，就必须执行严格的纪律。知识分子往往不容易了解共产党的纪律。有些人以为纪律和自由是互相对立、互相排斥的东西。他们甚至说：“我们害怕纪律，我们需要自由；共产党什么都好，就是没有自由，特别是个人自由；我们为了选择自由，宁可回避纪律。”著者针对着这种错误思想，向我们作了令人信服的解释：“这不是奴化的服从，而是科学的纪律。一位工程师不能随自己的意思建筑一座桥梁。他必须有相当的材料，在一定的地点，满足一定的需要，才能进行建筑。这些都是正确解决问题所必需的严格条件，在执行中不容有一点玩忽。这是使工程有效的必需条件”（本书第一四三页）。
    由此可见，散漫不羁乃是“自由”的敌人；而纪律——自觉的科学的纪律，才是产生真正自由的基础。著者说：“我们入党的那天，就是我们自由的开始。”这实是一句最有力的最精采的话。
    在这本书中，著者揭露了资产阶级自由的真面目，并指出了只有共产党才是从资本主义的奴役下解放群众的真正战士。当我们读了本书以后，我们定将了解到我们的国家正在稳步走向恩格斯所说“由必然的王国进于自由的王国的飞跃”（“反杜林论”）的道路。
