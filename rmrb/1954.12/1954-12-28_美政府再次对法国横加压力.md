Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: On the eve of the vote to be held in the French National Assembly on December 27th, the White House Press Secretary Hagerty, on December 26th, once again issued a statement in Augusta (where U.S. President Eisenhower is vacationing). The statement repeated the words Eisenhower had already used on December 24th to threaten France: he believed that the outcome of this vote was "extremely serious" and that the U.S. "government hopes that the outcome of this vote is not France's final decision on this matter." The statement said that since the French National Assembly voted against arming West Germany on December 24th, Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles have been in consultation several times a day. If the situation is contrary to what the U.S. government hopes, Eisenhower will fly back to Washington for consultations.
    This statement is in line with the arguments made by U.S. government officials in the past few days to threaten France: if the French National Assembly does not change its decision to reject the arming of West Germany, the U.S. and Britain will immediately consult on "revising" their strategic plans in Western Europe and "abandon" France to arm West Germany on their own. According to an Associated Press report, Dulles "will consider changing strategic plans so that the Western defense system is based on Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany."
    United Press reporter bluntly said that this threat to France is expected to "shock French parliamentarians and make them change their attitude."
    At the same time, some American newspapers have pointed out that the threat that the United States will arm West Germany regardless of France's attitude is difficult to achieve. A "Chicago Tribune" article said, "Of course, we can rearm Germany outside of NATO without France's consent, but if we do not get France's active cooperation, our chances of success in implementing our intervention policy in Europe are not great." The article said that it is reckless to implement a European policy that "we cannot expect European countries to agree to."

    美政府再次对法国横加压力
    【新华社二十七日讯】在法国国民议会二十七日举行投票的前夕，美国白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂二十六日又在奥古斯大（美国总统艾森豪威尔正在那里度假）那里发表声明。声明中重复艾森豪威尔已经在二十四日说过的威胁法国的话：他认为这次投票结果“极其严重”，美国“政府希望这个投票结果不是法国在这个问题上的最后决定”。声明说，自从法国国民议会二十四日对武装西德投了反对票以来，艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯每天都要通好几次电话来进行商谈。如果情况同美国政府希望的相反，艾森豪威尔就要飞返华盛顿进行商谈。
    这个声明正是配合着美国政府官员这几天散布的威胁法国的论调：如果法国国民议会不改变拒绝武装西德的决定，美国和英国将立即进行商谈，“修改”它们在西欧的战略计划，“抛弃”法国而径自武装西德。美联社消息说，杜勒斯“将考虑改变战略计划，以使西方防御体系以英国、比利时、荷兰以及西德为基地”。
    合众社记者露骨地说，对法国的这种威胁是指望“震动一下法国议员，使他们改变自己的态度”。
    同时，也有的美国报纸指出美国要不顾法国的态度而武装西德的威胁是难以实现的。“芝加哥论坛报”的一篇文章说，“当然，我们能够不经过法国的同意，在北大西洋公约组织以外重新武装德国，但是如果得不到法国的积极合作的话，我们在欧洲实行的干涉政策成功的机会就不大。”文章说，实行一种“我们不能指望欧洲国家同意”的欧洲政策是鲁莽的。
