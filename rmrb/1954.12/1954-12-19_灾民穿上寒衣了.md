The People's Government of Anhui Province has promptly distributed a large quantity of winter clothing in the disaster areas. This batch of winter clothing can basically solve the problem of winter clothing shortages for disaster victims. When distributing winter clothing in Huaiyuan County, the clothing was distributed rationally according to the different situations of the disaster victims, achieving "cloth for those who lack cloth, cotton for those who lack cotton." This not only completely solved the problem of winter clothing shortages for disaster victims, but also saved some cotton cloth and cotton, solving the problem of cotton quilt shortages for some disaster victims.

The disaster victims were very grateful to receive the winter clothing sent by the People's Government, and their confidence in overcoming the disaster was strengthened. Li Yingyou, a disaster victim in Shengqiao, Nanling County, received a new cotton-padded jacket and said with a smile, "If it weren't for the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we would never have dreamed of wearing such a good cotton-padded jacket in such a year of severe flooding." Mutual aid group leaders Tang Litang and Wang Defa said: The People's Government has distributed relief grain and winter clothing, helping us solve our difficulties, and we must work harder to produce and help ourselves, and we must overcome the disaster.

    灾民穿上寒衣了
    安徽省人民政府已在灾区及时发放了大批寒衣。这批寒衣基本上可以解决缺衣灾民过冬的困难。怀远县在发放寒衣时，根据灾民不同情况合理发放，做到“缺布发布，缺棉发棉”，不但全部解决了灾民缺寒衣的困难，而且还节余了一些棉布和棉花，给一些灾民解决了缺棉被的困难。
    灾民们接到了人民政府送来的寒衣，非常感激，对战胜灾荒的信心更坚定了。南陵县盛桥灾民李应友领到一件新棉袄，笑着说：“要不是共产党和毛主席的好领导，这样大水的年头，做梦也想不到还能穿上这样好的棉袄。”互助组长汤立堂和王得法说：人民政府发了救济粮又发寒衣，帮助我们解决了困难，我们自己更要努力生产自救，一定要战胜灾荒。
