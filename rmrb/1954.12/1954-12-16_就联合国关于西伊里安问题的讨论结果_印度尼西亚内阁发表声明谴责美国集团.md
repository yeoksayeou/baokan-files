Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 13th: The Indonesian Cabinet held a meeting on the 12th to discuss the results of the United Nations' discussion on the West Irian issue. In a statement issued after the meeting, the Indonesian Cabinet expressed its gratitude to the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and the countries of Asia and Africa for their support of Indonesia on the West Irian issue. At the same time, the Cabinet condemned the position of the U.S. bloc countries, saying that "they support colonialism."

The statement said that only the unity of all the people can win the return of West Irian to the Republic of Indonesia. The statement said: "The unity of the people—this is the most important factor guaranteeing victory in resolving the West Irian issue."

On the 12th, a mass rally of several thousand people was held in Yogyakarta, demanding the return of West Irian to Indonesia. Sudjono, Chairman of the Indonesian People's Party, delivered a speech at the meeting, saying that West Irian is an indivisible territory of the Republic of Indonesia.

The "People's Daily" published a statement by Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, which emphasized that the fact that the United Nations rejected the proposal on West Irian proves how the United States and Western countries are using the United Nations to achieve their own goals. The statement said that the UN discussions on West Irian proved who Indonesia's real friends are.

Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo issued a statement saying that Indonesia will continue its efforts to peacefully resolve the West Irian issue.
