    Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: The unprecedented large-scale grain transfer work in our country during the 1953-1954 grain year has been victoriously completed. The amount of grain transferred this year was 2.8 times higher than the large-scale grain transfer in 1950. After this comprehensive scheduling, people in the Northeast can eat rice from the Yangtze River basin and wheat from the Yellow River basin, and the coarse grains from the Northeast can meet the needs of farmers in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan; the grain from Sichuan is supplied to areas all over the country. In addition to this variety adjustment, some areas that did not produce enough grain were also able to balance surpluses and deficits. The planned purchase and comprehensive scheduling of grain have enabled the rational supply of grain in various regions, and fundamentally changed the past phenomenon of "cheap grain hurting farmers" here and "grain prices ten times higher" there.

    In this year, the state's expenditure on grain scheduling is roughly equivalent to the cost of building several automobile manufacturing plants. The scope of grain transfer covers twenty-four provinces, and the forces mobilized range from shoulder carrying, manual carrying, and donkey transport to automobiles and trains. In April of this year, when the Xilingol League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was hit by a disaster, the state dispatched aircraft to airdrop grain to the grasslands. The Southwest is a region where grain is difficult to transport. In this year, fifteen hundred million jin or more of grain was transferred out from the Yangtze River, from Xiushan and Youyang in Sichuan to Hunan, from Guizhou to Jinchengjiang in Guangxi, from Congjiang and Rongjiang in Guizhou to Guangxi, and from Zhenyuan and Tongren in Guizhou to Hunan, in five routes. In Sichuan Province, there were 14,000 to 15,000 ships transporting grain on seventy-seven rivers of all sizes, and approximately four to five million people were mobilized to participate in the grain transport work. This large-scale comprehensive scheduling has played a significant role in ensuring supply, supporting production, and stabilizing grain prices. This autumn, fourteen provinces supplied 170 million jin of various grain seeds to farmers in the disaster areas of Hubei and Anhui. In the face of the worst flood in a century, grain prices in the disaster areas remained stable. This situation made the people in the disaster areas overjoyed. When the disaster victims in Hubei and Anhui ate grain from Sichuan and Guangdong, they said that the state's grain policy was a "life-saving policy." After the four to five years of accumulated old grain in the Wuling Mountains and Mufu Mountains was transported out, it strongly supported the production of local farmers. After the surplus grain in remote areas of Guizhou was transported out, the local grain price, which was originally only two to three hundred yuan per jin, has now been reasonably increased.

    This comprehensive scheduling of grain is something that successive dynasties in our country and the corrupt and incompetent Kuomintang reactionary rulers could not accomplish. In the more than two hundred years since Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty ordered the import of foreign rice in 1721, foreign rice has gradually flooded the market, often leading to "disasters in bumper harvests." After the bumper harvest in 1933, in places like Yichun and Ji'an in Jiangxi, where water and land transportation were convenient, the selling price of each dan of grain was five jiao to one yuan lower than the cost. Farmers had a large amount of surplus grain that they could not sell or transport out. Successive rulers all knew that transporting grain would lose money. At that time, people said, "Grain is not transported for a thousand miles," but the People's Government, for the benefit of the people of the whole country, especially the farmers, has changed this situation. The transportation costs for grain transported out of the Southwest were more than 30 percent of the value of the grain. In Sichuan, the state purchased grain at a price of seven hundred yuan per jin. After this grain was transported out of Xiushan and Youyang, across the Wuling Mountains for more than a thousand kilometers, it was sold to disaster victims in Hunan at a price of eight hundred yuan per jin. The state subsidized more than two trillion yuan in grain transportation this year. This is something that no grain merchant could do, and the means by which private merchants used to add profit at each stage of transportation are familiar to farmers everywhere.

### 一九五三—一九五四粮食年度  大规模粮食调运工作胜利完成

    一九五三—一九五四粮食年度
    大规模粮食调运工作胜利完成
    【新华社十三日讯】一九五三—一九五四粮食年度，我国空前规模的粮食调运工作已胜利完成。这个年度调动粮食的数量高出一九五零年那次大规模调粮数量二点八倍。经过这种通盘调度以后，东北人可以吃到长江流域的大米和黄河流域的小麦，东北的杂粮可以供应河北、山东、江苏、河南农民的需要；川粮供应的地区遍及各地。除这种品种调剂以外，有些地区产不抵销，还调剂了粮食的余缺。粮食的计划收购和通盘调度，使各地粮食都得以合理供应，并根本改变了过去这里“谷贱伤农”，那里“粮价十倍”的现象。
    在这个年度，国家用于调度粮食的费用，大约可以兴建几个汽车制造厂。调粮的范围遍及二十四个省，动用的力量从肩背、人挑、驴驮到汽车和火车。今年四月，内蒙古自治区锡林郭勒盟受灾时，国家出动飞机向草原空投了粮食。西南是粮食难运的地区，这个年度，从长江，从四川的秀山、酉阳到湖南，从贵州到广西的金城江，从贵州从江、榕江到广西，从贵州镇远、铜仁到湖南，共分五路调出了十五亿斤以上的粮食。四川省大小七十七条河道，有一万四、五千只船运粮，全省先后曾动员了约四、五百万人参加运粮工作。这种大规模的通盘调度，对保证供应、支援生产、稳定粮价都起了巨大的作用。今年秋季十四个省供应了湖北、安徽灾区农民一亿七千万斤各种粮食的种籽。在遭受百年未有的大水灾的情况下，灾区粮价稳定。这种情况使灾区人民喜出望外，湖北、安徽灾民吃到四川、广东的粮食时，说国家的粮食政策是“救命政策”。五岭山地区和幕阜山区积存四、五年的陈粮运出后，有力地支援了当地农民的生产。贵州边远地区的余粮运出后，当地粮价原来每斤只二、三百元，现在价格已合理提高了。
    这种粮食的通盘调度，是我国历代王朝和腐败无能的国民党反动统治者所不能办到的。从一七二一年清朝康熙下令输入洋米以后的二百多年间，洋米逐渐充斥市场，经常“丰收成灾”。一九三三年丰收后，在江西宜春、吉安这样水陆交通便利的地方，每担谷的售价都低于成本五角到一元，农民有大批余粮卖不掉，运不出。历代统治者都知道运粮要赔钱，那时人们说“千里不运粮”，但人民政府为了全国人民特别是农民的利益，改变了这种情况。西南运出的粮食，运费都在粮食价值的百分之三十以上。在四川，国家收购每斤粮的价格是七百元，这些粮食运出秀山、酉阳，翻过武陵大山运行了一千多公里后，在湖南以每斤八百元的价格卖给灾民。国家在这一年度运粮赔贴了两万多亿元。这是任何粮商所不能办到的，而私商过去运一程加一利的手段，是各地农民所熟悉的。
