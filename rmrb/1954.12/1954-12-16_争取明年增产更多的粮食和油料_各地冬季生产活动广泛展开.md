Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In order to strive for greater grain and oilseed production next year, farmers in various regions are widely engaged in winter production activities.

    Farmers in Heilongjiang Province are carrying out large-scale preparatory work to increase grain production next year. In the vast fields, farmers are busy transporting manure to the fields. The agricultural production cooperative of Zhifu Village, Ninth District, Anda County, has also launched a manure accumulation competition. Farmers in various regions attach great importance to selecting and retaining superior seeds. The Tuanshanzi Collective Farm in Ning'an County has already transferred 96,250 jin of superior wheat seeds to 28 agricultural production cooperatives. Suihua, Hailun and other counties are addressing the difficulty of insufficient livestock feed and strengthening livestock maintenance work.

    Most of the more than 2,290 agricultural production cooperatives established before spring in Rehe Province have formulated winter production activity plans. More than 200 old cooperatives in the mountainous areas of Chengde County have begun to build terraced fields, embankments, and control gullies according to their plans. The Xinsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingquan County has begun to transport manure to the fields, planning to deliver all the base fertilizer to the fields before the Spring Festival. Agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have also carried out various sideline production activities such as transportation, pig raising, weaving, and hunting.

    In Shanxi Province, the winter fallow land that has been plowed generally reaches 70 to 80 percent, and the plowed area has been expanded compared with last year. In order to plow in a timely manner and improve cultivation techniques, agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province are using a total of 1,540 horse-drawn farm implements. The plowing efficiency is one and a half to two times higher than with old-fashioned plows, and the plowing depth is also about two inches deeper. When plowing, some farmers with more difficulties also received support from agricultural production cooperatives. Hukuan County discovered that 2,000 mu of fallow land had not been plowed by farmers lacking animal power. It immediately organized these farmers and agricultural production cooperatives to plow on their behalf by exchanging manual labor for animal labor, and grain stalks for animal labor. Various regions also universally organized women and children to follow the plows to pick up grass roots, stubble, and insect eggs to eliminate overwintering pests. Some areas also applied base fertilizer in advance after plowing.

    After planting wheat, farmers in various parts of Shandong Province have universally carried out manure accumulation by using soil pushers to line pens, accumulating urine, accumulating plant ash, digging silt, and increasing pig breeding. Sixty-three agricultural production cooperatives in Deping County have led more than 64,000 households in the county to accumulate manure, and each household has now accumulated an average of five carts of manure. To prevent excessive wheat seedling growth, more than 1.2 million mu of wheat fields in 13 counties, including Liaocheng, Shouzhang, Jining, Heze, and Laiwu, have been rolled and trampled. Farmers in Changshan, Zhangqiu and other counties used river water and well water to irrigate wheat fields to prevent wheat seedlings from freezing. Farmers in various regions have also adopted topdressing and weeding methods to promote wheat root development and tillering.

    The sowing of more than 33 million mu of wheat in Jiangsu Province has basically ended. Farmers in various regions are taking various effective measures to protect wheat seedlings through the winter safely. Farmers in rice-wheat double-cropping areas generally open drainage ditches in wheat fields. Farmers in dryland areas water and fertilize wheat fields to regulate soil temperature. In Yancheng, Songjiang and other special districts, some farmers scatter plant ash and firewood shavings in wheat fields to store heat and protect seedlings. Farmers in water network areas mobilize thousands of small boats to dig river mud and pond mud, dry it in the sun, and apply it to wheat ridges, which has both cold protection and topdressing purposes.

    Winter production activities with winter plowing and manure accumulation as the main content have been universally launched in rural Henan Province. About 80 percent of the winter fields that should be plowed in Anyang, Xinxiang, Xuchang and other special districts have now been plowed. Winter plowing has basically ended in the southern counties of Guangshan, Luoshan, and the counties of Xingyang, Lushan, and Yuxian, where the unified purchase and sales work ended earlier. Winter production activities such as manure accumulation, channel repair, pond and dam construction, well digging, and afforestation in various regions have also made great progress. In order to promote the healthy growth of wheat seedlings, farmers in various regions often topdress, roll, and weed wheat fields, and conserve soil moisture by accumulating snow after snowfall.

    Hubei Province, one of China's major rapeseed producing areas, has expanded its rapeseed planting area by 780,000 mu this year, exceeding the predetermined plan by 9 percent. In the Jianghan Plain and counties such as Xishui, Huanggang, and Xiaogan, where rapeseed is concentrated, many farmers have changed the habit of not planting rapeseed in winter fallow paddy fields in previous years, and have expanded the rapeseed planting area by an average of 30 to 40 percent. In order to overcome the contradictions of late water retreat and the tight rapeseed sowing season, the disaster areas have also vigorously promoted the method of rapeseed seedling cultivation and transplantation. At present, the rapeseed fields are lush green, and farmers are taking advantage of the good soil moisture after the snow to check the seedlings and replant.

    Winter crops are growing well in various parts of Hunan Province, and rapeseed and wheat are lush green. Up to now, according to statistics from more than 70 counties, more than 17.4 million mu of winter crops such as rapeseed, wheat, and broad beans have been sown. Among them, rapeseed reaches more than 3.4 million mu. In order to strive for a bumper rapeseed harvest, farmers in various regions are actively carrying out seedling separation, gap filling, and topdressing. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have also prepared a large number of 666 powder to supply farmers for pest control.

    争取明年增产更多的粮食和油料
    各地冬季生产活动广泛展开
    据新华社讯：为争取明年增产更多的粮食和油料，各地农民广泛展开冬季生产活动。
    黑龙江省的农民们为明年增产更多的粮食展开了规模巨大的准备工作。在广阔的田野上，农民们正忙着把粪肥运送到田里去。安达县九区致富村的农业生产合作社还开展了积肥竞赛。各地农民非常重视选留优良种子。宁安县团山子集体农庄已经把优良麦种九万六千二百五十斤，调剂给了二十八个农业生产合作社。绥化、海伦等县正在解决牲畜饲料不足的困难，并加强牲畜保养工作。
    热河省春前建立的二千二百九十多个农业生产合作社，大多数都订出冬季生产活动的计划。承德县山区的二百多个老社，都已根据计划先后开始修梯田、垒坝沿和闸山沟。平泉县新生农业生产合作社已开始往地里送粪，计划春节前把基肥全部送到地里。各地农业生产合作社还开展了运输、养猪、编织、打猎等各种副业生产活动。
    山西省农民翻耕过的冬季休闲地一般达到百分之七十到八十，翻耕面积比去年扩大。为了适时翻耕，并改进耕作技术，全省各地农业生产合作社共使用一千五百四十部马拉农具，耕作效率比用旧式犁提高一倍半到两倍，耕的深度也多两寸左右。在翻地时，有些困难较多的农户还得到农业生产合作社的支援。壶关县发现缺乏畜力的农户有两千亩休闲地未耕，当即组织这些农户和农业生产合作社以人工换畜工、谷草换畜工等办法代耕。各地并普遍组织妇女、儿童随犁拾草根、谷茬和虫卵，以消灭越冬害虫。有的地区翻耕后还提前施了底肥。
    山东省各地农民在种完小麦后，就用推土垫栏、积尿、积草木灰、挖淤泥和增养猪只等办法，普遍开展了积肥。德平县六十三个农业生产合作社，带动全县六万四千多农户积肥，现在每户平均已积肥五车。为防止麦苗生长过旺，聊城、寿张、济宁、菏泽、莱芜等十三个县已有一百二十多万亩麦田经过砘压和脚踩。长山、章邱等县农民利用河水、井水浇灌麦田，防止麦苗受冻。各地农民还纷纷采用追肥和锄麦等办法，促进小麦发根扩杈。
    江苏省三千三百多万亩小麦播种工作已基本结束。各地农民正在采取各种有效措施，保护麦苗安全过冬。稻麦两熟地区的农民普遍在麦田里开排水沟。旱田地区农民在麦田里浇水浇粪，调节土壤温度。盐城、松江等专区有的农民在麦田里撒草木灰、柴草屑，蓄温护苗。水网地区农民出动成千上万条小船挖河泥、塘泥，晒干后施在麦垅上，具有防寒和追肥两种用途。
    河南省农村以冬耕、积肥等为主要内容的冬季生产活动普遍展开。安阳、新乡、许昌等专区的应耕冬田，现在已耕完了百分之八十左右。南部的光山、罗山和统购统销工作结束较早的荥阳、鲁山、禹县等县，冬耕已基本结束。各地的积肥、整修渠道、塘堰、打井和造林等冬季生产活动也都有很大进展。为了促使麦苗健壮生长，各地农民多在麦田里进行追肥、碾麦、锄麦，并在雪后积雪保墒。
    我国主要油菜产区之一的湖北省，今年油菜播种面积比去年扩大七十八万亩，超过预定计划百分之九。油菜集中产区江汉平原和浠水、黄冈、孝感等县，很多农民改变历年不在冬季休闲水田种油菜的习惯，平均扩大油菜播种面积百分之三十到四十。为了克服退水迟和油菜播种季节紧的矛盾，水灾区还大力推广了油菜育苗移栽的办法。目前油菜田一片嫩绿，农民正趁雪后墒土较好查苗补种。
    湖南省各地冬季作物生长良好，油菜、小麦一片嫩绿。到目前止，据七十多个县的统计，已播种油菜、小麦和蚕豆等冬季作物一千七百四十多万亩。其中油菜达三百四十多万亩。为了争取油菜籽丰收，各地农民正在积极进行分苗补缺和追施肥料。各地供销合作社也准备了大批六六六药粉，供应农民防治虫害。
