The "Exhibition of Natural Environment and Mineral Resources of the Motherland," organized by the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum of Natural History, has officially opened in the Wenhua Hall inside Donghuamen, Beijing. The exhibition consists of six units, vividly introducing the natural features and rich mineral resources of our great motherland to the people through various objects, specimens, models, and pictures.

The upper right picture shows a group of young students visiting the exhibition, attracted by the national terrain model. Look, how vast is the territory of the motherland! How complex is the terrain! There are plains and basins where many kinds of crops grow, and plateaus and mountains covered with dense forests and storing abundant mineral resources. How lovable is the motherland! Every word of the guide aroused great interest among the students. Everyone listened and watched excitedly. The youths felt proud to grow up in such a great and rich country.

The lower picture shows three three-dimensional diorama boxes introducing the climate of the motherland. From here, you can see three completely different scenes: the first is the Daxing'anling Mountains, covered with subarctic coniferous forests and snow; the second is the tropical scenery of Guangdong and Hainan Island, with coconut trees and banyan trees; the third is the scenic Yangtze River basin. These three diorama boxes not only simply explain the relationship between organisms and the environment from a scientific point of view, but also show that our country spans the frigid, temperate, and tropical zones. There are many kinds of organisms on the land of the motherland, which is extremely favorable for the development of our industry and agriculture.

Steel is the most basic material for national industrial construction, and the scale of the steel industry to a certain extent marks the level of national industrial development. In order to develop the steel industry, our country has conducted large-scale exploration work in the past five years, and has found new large iron ore areas in many regions.

The upper picture is an exhibit of the ferrous metal section—magnetite (lower right corner), and the exterior of No. 7 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

Petroleum is the blood of industry. Its application range is very wide, and industry, infrastructure construction, transportation, agriculture, forestry, fishery, national defense, and even daily life all need it. In recent years, with the development of drilling, our country has discovered many new oil deposits.

The upper picture shows crude oil exhibits from several oil fields in the petroleum section (lower right corner), and a part of the gasoline refining branch of the Yumen Oilfield Refinery.

Coal is the food of industry. Our country has abundant coal resources, not only in large reserves, but also in excellent quality. In recent years, coal production has also been increasing with the development of industrial production.

The upper picture is an exhibit of the coal mine section—coking coal (lower right corner), and the situation of coke production in Benxi Coking Plant.

Non-metallic minerals are minerals that are not used for metal refining. Our country has many types of non-metallic mineral reserves and good quality. Minerals such as marble, kaolin, limestone, quartz, mica, and asbestos are indispensable materials for industry and infrastructure construction.

The upper picture is one of the non-metallic mineral exhibits—pyrite (lower right corner, pyrite is a raw material for manufacturing chemical fertilizers), and a corner of Yongli Chemical Company's Ningchang factory.

The upper picture: One of the non-metallic mineral exhibits—asbestos (lower right corner), and asbestos mined in a certain area of Xinjiang.

The photos in this issue, except for the production parts of various factories and mines provided by Xinhua News Agency, People's Pictorial, and the Liberation Army Pictorial, the exhibition part was taken by our reporters Yuan Yiping and Zhang Li.

Non-ferrous metals refer to all metal elements other than iron, manganese, and chromium. Non-ferrous metals and their alloys are indispensable raw materials for electrical, mechanical, chemical, defense, printing and other industries, and play a huge role in national industrialization, agricultural collectivization, and national defense modernization. The physical exhibits and charts of the non-ferrous metal section of the exhibition will make people amazed at how many kinds of non-ferrous metals our motherland has.

The left picture shows some exhibits of non-ferrous metal minerals (from left to right): stibnite, bauxite, cassiterite, bornite, galena, and gold-silver-bearing pyrite.

Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and other provinces are areas rich in petroleum reserves. In the strata of the thirteen geological periods, natural petroleum, natural gas, oil shale and oil-refining minerals have been found in nine strata.

The upper picture is a kind of ore in the petroleum section exhibits—oil shale (lower right corner), and a train transporting oil shale in Fushun Open-pit Coal Mine.

Iron ore is distributed almost everywhere in our country, not only with abundant reserves, good quality, but also many kinds.

The upper picture is another exhibit of the ferrous metal section—hematite (lower right corner), and a train transporting ore sand in Longyan Iron Mine. The Longyan Iron Mine transports thousands of tons of ore sand every day to supply the needs of steel plants in Northeast China, North China and other places.

专栏：

    中央自然博物馆筹备处主办的“祖国自然环境与矿产资源展览”已在北京东华门内文华殿正式揭幕。展览会展出的共有六个单元，它用各种实物、标本、模型和图片等生动地向人们介绍了我们伟大的祖国的自然面貌和富饶的矿产资源。
    右图是一群参观展览会的青年学生，被全国地形模型吸引住了。看，祖国幅员是多么广大！地形是多么复杂！有生长种类繁多的农作物的平原和盆地，有覆着茂密的森林、贮藏着丰富矿产的高原和山地。祖国是多么可爱啊！解说员的每一句话都引起了同学们的很大兴趣，大家兴奋地听着，看着。青年们为自己能成长在这样一个伟大的富饶的国家里而感到自豪。
    下图是介绍祖国气候的三个立体布景箱。从这里可以看到三种迥然不同的景色：第一个是生长着亚寒带的针叶林，和积雪的大兴安岭山地；第二个是长着椰树和榕树的广东、海南岛的热带景色；第三个是景色秀丽的长江流域。这三个布景箱不但从科学上简单地说明生物和环境的关系，而且表示了我国地跨寒、温、热三带。祖国大地上的生物种类很多，这对发展我国的工农业都是极有利的条件。
    钢铁是国家工业建设上最基本的材料，钢铁工业的规模在一定程度上标志着国家工业发展的水平。为了发展钢铁工业，五年来，我国进行了大规模的勘探工作，在许多地区找出了新的大的铁矿区。
    上图是黑色金属部分的一种展品—磁铁矿（右下角），和鞍山钢铁公司七号炼铁高炉外景。
    石油是工业的血液。它的应用范围很广，工业、基本建设、交通运输、农林、渔业、国防以至日常生活等方面，都需要它。近几年来跟着钻探事业的发展，我国已发现了许多新的石油矿藏。
    上图是石油部分的几个油矿出产的原油展品（右下角），和玉门油矿炼油厂汽油制炼分厂外貌的一部。
    煤是工业的食粮。我国有丰富的煤矿资源，不但藏量大，品质也非常优良。近年来，煤的产量也随着工业生产的发展在日益增长着。
    上图是煤矿部分的一种展品——炼焦煤（右下角），和本溪炼焦厂出焦的情形。
    非金属矿产是不作提炼金属用的矿产。我国非金属矿的储藏种类多，品质好。如大理石，高岭土，石灰石，石英，云母和石棉等矿产，都是工业和基本建设不可缺少的材料。
    上图是非金属矿产展品中的一种——黄铁矿（右下角，黄铁矿是制造化学肥料的原料），和永利化学公司宁厂的一角。
    上图：非金属矿产展品的一种——石棉（右下角），和在新疆某地开采出来的石棉。
    本期照片除介绍各厂矿生产部分为新华社、人民画报和解放军画报供稿外，展览会部分为本报记者袁毅平、张力摄
    有色金属是指铁、锰、铬以外的全部金属元素。有色金属及其合金是电气、机械、化学、国防、印刷等工业上必不可缺少的原料，它对国家工业化、农业集体化、国防近代化起着极大的作用。展览会上有色金属部分的实物展品和图表，会使人惊异我们祖国有色金属有那样多的种类。
    左图是有色金属矿产的部分展品（自左至右）：辉锑矿、辉铝矿、锡石、斑铜矿、方铅矿、含金银黄铁矿。
    青海、甘肃、四川等省都是石油贮量丰富的地带，在十三个地质时代的地层中，就有九个地层发现有天然石油、天然气、油母页岩及可炼油的矿藏。
    上图是石油部分展品中的一种矿石——油页岩（右下角），和抚顺露天煤矿装运油母页岩的列车。
    我国几乎到处都有铁矿分布着，不但贮量丰富，质地良好，而且种类很多。
    上图是黑色金属部分的另一种展品——赤铁矿（右下角），和龙烟铁矿装运矿砂的火军。龙烟铁矿每天要运出数以千吨的矿砂，供应东北、华北等地钢铁厂的需要。
