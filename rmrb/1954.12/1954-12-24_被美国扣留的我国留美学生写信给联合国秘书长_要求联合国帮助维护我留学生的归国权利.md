(Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd) According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on December 21st, thirty-one Chinese students forcibly detained by the US government wrote to UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld on December 16th, requesting the United Nations to help safeguard the right of Chinese students detained by the US government to return to China, so that they can return to their homeland.

In their letter, the Chinese students said that some of them have been waiting for exit permits since 1951 or 1952. Although the exact number of Chinese students who are unable to return home due to restrictions imposed by the US government cannot be ascertained, they know that the number of people eagerly hoping to return home is much larger than those who signed this letter.

The letter said: "Many of us have repeatedly appealed to the President of the United States, the State Department, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but to no avail. Some of us have been waiting for exit permits for three years."

The letter mentioned the provisions of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights regarding freedom to return to one's country, and requested the United Nations to take "positive steps" to "uphold the clearly stated UN principles and the sacred humanitarian cause."

    被美国扣留的我国留美学生写信给联合国秘书长
    要求联合国帮助维护我留学生的归国权利
    【新华社二十二日讯】据路透社纽约二十一日消息报道，被美国政府强迫扣留着的三十一名中国留学生十二月十六日写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，要求联合国帮助维护被美国政府扣留的中国留学生的归国权利，使他们能够返回祖国。
    中国留学生在他们的信里说，他们中有一些人自一九五一年或一九五二年以来，就一直在等待出境许可。虽然不能肯定受到美国政府的限制而不能返国的中国学生的确切数目，但是，他们知道迫切希望回家的人的数目比在这封信上签名的人要多得多。
    信里说：“我们中许多人曾一再向美国总统、国务院和移民和归化局呼吁，但是都没有用处。我们有一些人等候出境许可已经有三年之久了。”
    这封信中提到联合国人权宣言中关于归国自由的规定，要求联合国采取“积极步骤”，“维护明白宣布的联合国原则和神圣的人道事业”。
