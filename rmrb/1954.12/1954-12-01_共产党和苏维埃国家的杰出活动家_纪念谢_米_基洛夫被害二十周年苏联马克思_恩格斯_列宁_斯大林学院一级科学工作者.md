    Outstanding Activist of the Communist Party and the Soviet State
    -- Commemorating the Twentieth Anniversary of the Murder of S.M. Kirov
    A. Zubarev, First-Class Scientific Worker of the Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin Institute of the Soviet Union

    Twenty years ago, on December 1, 1934, Sergei Mironovich Kirov, a passionate and courageous revolutionary, an outstanding activist of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, was brutally murdered by fascist hirelings of the counter-revolutionary Trotsky-Bukharin gang.

    Kirov, a true son of the working class, was beloved by the Communist Party and all the working people of the Soviet Union. He was an example of a Communist Party member who was unafraid in the struggle to achieve the great goals set by the Communist Party. Kirov not only possessed the party member's frankness, unwavering firmness, and unparalleled purity, as well as the excellent qualities of a passionate advocate of the proletarian revolution, but also demonstrated the genuine human qualities of kindness, warmth, and humility in his interactions with comrades.

    After joining the ranks of the Communist Party in 1904, Kirov forever linked his entire life with the Party. From then until his murder, he always cherished the great title of member of the Communist Party created by the great Lenin and maintained its purity.

    Kirov went through a difficult and glorious path of revolutionary activity and struggle, and he was one of the outstanding leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet state.

    Kirov was one of those outstanding Leninist activists who shouldered the heavy responsibilities of all struggles against Tsarist autocracy, landlords, and capitalists, and Kirov always stood at the forefront of the struggle and in the most dangerous areas. He was a tireless organizer of the masses and a passionate propagandist and agitator. During the years of the civil war, the Party sent him to the most important areas in the struggle against foreign interventionists and White Guards, sending him to guard Astrakhan and the lower Volga region. Kirov did not fail to live up to the trust of the Party and gloriously completed his tasks.

    Kirov made tremendous contributions to the cause of establishing and consolidating Soviet power in the North Caucasus and Transcaucasus. In the complex circumstances where the remnants of national hatred had not yet been eliminated, Kirov tirelessly consolidated the alliance between the working class and the working peasants, uncompromisingly and ruthlessly exposed the Trotskyites and bourgeois nationalist tendencies, and educated party and Soviet cadres of all nationalities in the spirit of proletarian internationalism and the thorough implementation of Lenin-Stalin's national policy, uniting the multi-ethnic peoples of the Caucasus into a unified family.

      In 1921, Kirov was elected Secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party. Under his leadership, tremendous work was carried out to restore the national economy of the republic, especially the restoration and development of the oil industry. The oil industry was of particularly great significance for the restoration of the national economy of the entire Soviet state.

    During his four and a half years as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party, Kirov won the love and gratitude of the Baku workers and all the working people of Azerbaijan due to his constant concern for the needs of the working people, for the development of culture with national forms and socialist content, and for the consolidation of the friendship of the Soviet nationalities.

    After the Fourteenth Congress of the Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union dispatched Kirov to Leningrad. There, he, along with other members of the Central Committee, launched active activities to explain the resolutions of the Party Congress to the Bolsheviks in Leningrad, expose the Zinovievites, and unite the Leningrad Party organization around the Party Central Committee. In February 1926, the communists of Leningrad elected Kirov as their leader at the extraordinary representative meeting of the Leningrad Provincial Party. He worked in this position until the last minute of his life.

    In the complex and difficult period of the Soviet state's development along the socialist road – a period of sharp class struggle within the country and struggle within the Party, and intensified capitalist encirclement's sabotage against the Soviet Union – Kirov's outstanding organizational talent shone with all its brilliance. He contributed all his strength and inexhaustible energy to the struggle to purify and unite the Leningrad Party organization, to fight for the ideological and political and organizational unity of the Party, and to fight for the implementation of the Party's general line.

    Kirov was good at inspiring the working masses to wage selfless struggles to realize the Party's general line and to achieve the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union. He constantly explained to the workers of Leningrad the significance of the socialist industrialization of the Soviet state and the role that Leningrad's industry should play in the realization of industrialization.

    The Leningrad Party organization launched a selfless struggle to transform the city into a supply base for the country's socialist industrialization, and the Leningrad Party organization achieved great success in all sectors of socialist construction.

    Kirov was the initiator of the development of the Soviet North. He persistently called on scientific organizations and all practical workers to survey all the rich and vast Arctic regions in order to make these resources serve socialism. His efforts did not fail. In a short period of time, that "area where even birds are not startled" has become active, and power stations, factories, and new buildings there have shone brightly.

    Deep paternal care for the people was one of Kirov's excellent qualities. He cared about making workers live in comfortable and beautiful houses, and building cultural palaces, clubs, and cinemas for them.

    Hundreds of people often came to him, and everyone who came could hear his opinions and receive his help.

    Kirov paid special attention to the development of agriculture and the needs of collective farmers. He personally reviewed the people sent to the countryside, emphasizing their responsibility as representatives of the working class in the countryside.

    Kirov cared about the consolidation of the defense forces of the Soviet state. He strived to consolidate the economic, political, and military power of the Soviet state, sparing no effort and tirelessly. He personally inspected the Red Army barracks in the Leningrad Military District, checked shooting, visited many warships, participated in the exercises of the Baltic Fleet, and attended the congresses of the Red Army and the Red Navy. In his speeches, Kirov often reminded the Soviet people to pay attention to the capitalist encirclement and the threat of armed imperialist invasion from the outside.

    Kirov taught the working people of Leningrad to infinitely love and be loyal to the motherland, and to deeply hate the enemy. He called on the Red Army and Red Navy soldiers of the Baltic Sea to resolutely defend the Soviet borders and defend the city of Lenin, and to be prepared to immediately retaliate against the imperialist bandits when the Communist Party and the Soviet regime issue the first call.

    As a fervent advocate of the Soviet state's peaceful foreign policy, Kirov exposed the conspiracies and adventurous plans of the imperialist aggressors against the Soviet Union and defended the cause of world peace. He pointed out more than once that in order to successfully build socialism and for the interests of all working people, we must steadfastly implement a policy of peace, which demonstrates the Soviet people's will to defend peace and helps expose the new instigators of imperialist war.

    Kirov was always unwavering in his deep conviction in the Soviet people, in the Soviet people's ability to defeat the enemy, and in the victory of communism.

    In all stages of the Soviet working people's struggle to build socialism in the Soviet Union, Kirov emphasized that the path to achieving socialist victory drawn up by Lenin is the only correct and historically inevitable path, and that the Communist Party is the inspiring and organizing force on this path.

    Kirov was a Marxist-Leninist with multifaceted cultivation. He always believed that the ideological arming of party members, enabling them to master the ever-victorious Marxist-Leninist theory, was of great significance. In his view, raising the ideological and political level of party cadres and conducting Marxist-Leninist education for all Communist Party members was one of the decisive conditions for the victory of communism. He called on Communist Party members to systematically and tirelessly study Marxist-Leninist theory, and called on party cadres to always remember that party education, the ideological training of Communist Party members, and raising all theoretical work to a higher level are the most important tasks of party organizations. Moreover, Kirov paid special attention to ensuring that party cadres must link theoretical study with the practice of communist construction, and must resolutely struggle against those shortcomings that hinder the victorious advance on the road to communism.

    Kirov attached great importance to broadly and courageously carrying out criticism and self-criticism, because this is a proven communist method of eradicating shortcomings in work. When he taught a comrade, he watched the comrade's expression and said with a sincere, communist attitude: "You, dear person, you have messed up the work and created confusion. If you can't stand up yourself, I will help you, and I will do everything I can to correct your mistakes. But if you don't correct them, dear person, then you can only blame yourself, and you will have to give way."

    Kirov loved the rich and colorful life of his country. He built it himself and eagerly hoped that his great motherland would achieve many brilliant victories.

    In the last year of his life, Kirov said emotionally from the podium of the Seventeenth Party Congress: "Our achievements are indeed very great. To tell the truth, somehow, I just want to live on and on."

    Kirov was not able to live to this day. The vile hands of the imperialist lackeys took away his glorious and beautiful life.

    The news of the murder of Kirov, the excellent son of the Party and the working class, caused deep sorrow in the hearts of the Soviet working people and the sincere friends of the Soviet Union, and aroused great anger and fervent hatred for the despicable murderers. The Soviet working class, all the working people, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union swore before Kirov's spirit that they would strive to eliminate all the counter-revolutionary scum on Soviet soil and victoriously complete the construction of a communist society, for which Kirov had fought so passionately.

    The Soviet people deeply mourn Kirov, who dedicated his entire life to the victory of the ideas of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin. The Communist Party, the working class, and all the working people of the great Soviet state will always remember him; the proletariat of the world and all progressive humanity will always remember him; the future generations of humanity who have been liberated will also remember him, because Kirov dedicated his outstanding life for their happiness.

    共产党和苏维埃国家的杰出活动家
    ——纪念谢·米·基洛夫被害二十周年
    苏联马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林学院一级科学工作者  阿·祖巴列夫
    二十年前，一九三四年十二月一日，热情勇敢的革命家、共产党和苏维埃国家的杰出活动家——谢尔盖依·米洛诺维奇·基洛夫，被反革命的托洛茨基—布哈林匪帮的法西斯雇佣分子凶恶地杀害了。
    工人阶级的真正儿子基洛夫，是共产党和苏联全体劳动人民所热爱的人。他是在为争取达到共产党所拟定的伟大目标而斗争中不知畏惧的共产党员的典范。基洛夫不但具有党员的坦率、不可动摇的坚定和无比的纯洁，具有无产阶级革命的热情的宣扬者的优秀品质，而且他在跟同志们相处的时候，又表现出一个真正的人所具有的那种亲切、热情和谦逊。
    基洛夫在一九零四年参加了共产党的队伍以后，他就把自己的整个生命永远同党结合在一起了。从那时起到被害，他始终珍视由伟大的列宁所缔造的共产党的党员的伟大称号，并保持了它的纯洁性。
    基洛夫经历了艰巨而光荣的革命活动和斗争的道路，他是共产党和苏维埃国家的杰出的领导者之一。
    基洛夫是那些肩负着反对沙皇专制、地主和资本家的一切斗争重任的、列宁式的杰出的活动家之一，基洛夫总是站在斗争的前列和最危险的地区。他是不倦的群众组织者，是热情的宣传家和鼓动家。在国内战争年代里，党派他到同外国干涉者和白卫分子斗争最重要的地区，派他去守卫阿斯特拉罕和伏尔加河下游地区。基洛夫没有辜负党的信任，光荣地完成了任务。
    基洛夫在建立和巩固北高加索和外高加索的苏维埃政权的事业中有着巨大的功绩。在当时民族仇视的残余还没有消除的复杂情况下，基洛夫不倦地巩固了工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，毫不妥协地、无情地揭露了托洛茨基分子和资产阶级民族主义倾向分子，以无产阶级国际主义精神和彻底实行列宁—斯大林民族政策的精神来教育各民族的党的和苏维埃的干部，把多民族的高加索各族人民团结在一个统一的家庭里。
      一九二一年，基洛夫被选为阿塞拜疆共产党中央委员会书记。在他领导下，进行了恢复共和国国民经济，特别是恢复和发展石油工业的巨大工作。石油工业对于恢复整个苏维埃国家的国民经济是有着特别重大的意义的。
    基洛夫在任阿塞拜疆共产党中央委员会书记的四年半里，由于他对劳动人民的需求、对发展民族形式和社会主义内容的文化、对巩固苏维埃各民族友谊的不断关怀，获得了巴库工人和全阿塞拜疆劳动人民的热爱和感激。
    在共产党第十四次代表大会以后，苏联共产党中央委员会派遣基洛夫到列宁格勒。他在那里和其他中央委员一起展开积极的活动，向列宁格勒的布尔什维克解释党代表大会的决议，揭发季诺维也夫分子，把列宁格勒的党组织团结在党中央委员会的周围。一九二六年二月间，列宁格勒的共产党员在列宁格勒省党的非常代表会议上，选举了基洛夫为自己的领导人。他在这个岗位上一直工作到他的生命的最后一分钟。
    在苏维埃国家沿着社会主义道路发展的复杂而又困难的时期——国内阶级斗争和党内斗争尖锐化，资本主义包围对苏联内部破坏活动加强的时期，基洛夫卓越的组织天才显示出了全部的光辉。在争取列宁格勒党组织的纯洁和团结、争取党在思想政治上和组织上的统一、争取实现党的总路线的斗争中，他贡献出自己的全部力量和无穷无尽的精力。
    基洛夫善于鼓舞劳动群众为实现党的总路线、为使社会主义在苏联取得胜利而进行忘我的斗争。他不断向列宁格勒的工人解释苏维埃国家社会主义工业化的意义和列宁格勒的工业在实现工业化中所应起的作用。
    列宁格勒的党组织展开了忘我的斗争，以便使这个城市变为国家社会主义工业化的供应基地，列宁格勒的党组织在社会主义建设的一切部门都达到了巨大的成就。
    基洛夫是开发苏联北部的倡导人。他坚持不懈地号召科学组织和一切实际工作者去勘测丰富而广阔的北极地区所有的一切，以便使这些富源为社会主义服务。他的努力并没有落空。在很短的时间里，那个“鸟都不受惊的地区”已经活跃起来，那里的电力站、工厂和新建筑物已经大放光芒。
    对人民的深切的慈父般的关怀，是基洛夫的优秀品质之一。他关心着使工人们居住在舒适漂亮的房屋，为他们建筑文化宫、俱乐部和电影院。
    经常有成百的人到他这儿来，而每一个来的人都能听到他的意见和得到他的帮助。
    基洛夫特别关心农业的发展和集体农民的需求。他亲自审查派往农村去的人，强调他们作为工人阶级在农村中的代表所负的责任。
    基洛夫关怀苏维埃国家的国防力量的巩固。他努力于巩固苏维埃国家的经济、政治和军事的威力，不遗余力，不知疲倦。他亲自视察列宁格勒军区的红军兵营，检查射击，到过许多军舰上，参加过波罗的海舰队的演习，出席过红军和红海军的大会。基洛夫在自己的演说中，经常提醒苏联人民注意资本主义的包围，注意武装的帝国主义从外面侵入的威胁。
    基洛夫教导列宁格勒的劳动人民要无限热爱和忠于祖国，要深切痛恨敌人。他号召红军和波罗的海的红海军战士，坚决地保卫苏联国境和保卫列宁的城市，准备在共产党和苏维埃政权发出第一个号召的时候立即给帝国主义强盗以回击。
    作为苏维埃国家和平外交政策的热烈拥护者，基洛夫揭露了帝国主义侵略者反对苏联的阴谋诡计和冒险计划，捍卫了世界和平事业。他不止一次地指出，为了顺利地建设社会主义，为了全体劳动人民的利益，我们要坚定不移地实行和平政策，这个政策表明苏联人民保卫和平的意志，并有助于揭露新的帝国主义战争挑拨者。
    基洛夫一向是坚定不移地深信苏联人民，深信苏联人民能够战胜敌人，深信共产主义的胜利。
    在苏联劳动人民为在苏联建成社会主义的各个斗争阶段中，基洛夫强调指出：列宁所拟定的取得社会主义胜利的道路，是唯一正确的、在历史上必经的道路，而共产党则是在这条道路上的鼓舞力量和组织力量。
    基洛夫是一个具有多方面修养的马克思列宁主义者。他一向认为，党员的思想武装，使党员掌握百战百胜的马克思列宁主义理论是具有很大意义的。在他看来，提高党的干部的思想政治水平，对全体共产党员进行马克思列宁主义教育，是共产主义胜利的决定性条件之一。他号召共产党员要系统地、不倦地学习马克思列宁主义理论，号召党的干部要永远记住：党的教育，共产党员的思想锻炼，把一切理论工作提高到更高的程度，是党组织的一项最重要的任务。而且，基洛夫特别注意使党的干部必须把理论学习和共产主义建设的实际联系起来，必须对那些妨碍在共产主义道路上胜利前进的缺点进行坚决的斗争。
    基洛夫非常重视广泛地、勇敢地开展批评和自我批评，因为这是经过考验的根除工作中缺点的共产主义方法。当他教导一个同志时，他注视着这个同志的眼色，用真挚的、共产主义的态度说：“你，可爱的人，你把工作搞糟了，弄混乱了。假如你自己站不起来，我来帮助你，为了改正你的错误，我要尽一切努力。可是如果你不改正，可爱的人，那就只有怪你自己，那你就不得不让开了。”
    基洛夫热爱自己国家丰富多采的生活。他自己建设了它，并且热望自己的伟大祖国取得许多光辉的胜利。
    基洛夫在他生命的最后一年中，在第十七次党代表大会的讲坛上激动地说：“我们的成就确实是非常巨大的。如果说老实话，不知怎的，我简直想一直活下去。”
    基洛夫没有能够活到今天。帝国主义走狗的卑鄙的毒手夺去了他的光辉的、美好的生命。
    党和工人阶级的优秀儿子——基洛夫被凶杀的消息，在苏联劳动人民和苏联的真诚朋友的心中引起了深切哀痛，并且激起了人们对于卑鄙的凶手的极大愤怒和炽烈的仇恨。苏联的工人阶级，全体劳动人民和苏联共产党一起在基洛夫的灵前宣誓，他们要努力消灭苏联土地上的一切反革命败类和胜利地完成基洛夫曾为之热烈斗争的共产主义社会的建设事业。
    苏联人民深深地悼念着基洛夫，他为了争取马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林思想的胜利，贡献出了自己的整个一生。共产党、工人阶级和伟大的苏维埃国家的全体劳动人民将永远怀念着他；全世界无产阶级和全体进步人类将永远怀念着他；已经获得解放了的人类的未来一代也将怀念他，因为为了他们的幸福，基洛夫贡献了自己的卓越的一生。
