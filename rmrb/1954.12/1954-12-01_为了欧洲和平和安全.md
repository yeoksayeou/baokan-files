    For European Peace and Security
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    The conference of European nations to guarantee European peace and security, which has attracted worldwide attention, began its work in Moscow today (29th).
    All those who truly uphold European and world peace sincerely welcome the convening of this important conference initiated by the Soviet Union, because the struggle to defend European peace and security is at a critical juncture. Aggressive forces are attempting to quickly ratify the London and Paris agreements in order to revive West German militarism to create a new war. Peace-loving countries and peoples must, with urgent and joint efforts, break this new conspiracy that attempts to undermine the international détente that followed the Berlin and Geneva conferences.
    Participating in this conference to guarantee European peace and security are delegations from European countries such as the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, led by heads of government—chairmen or vice-chairmen of the Council of Ministers or premiers. Zhang Wentian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, is participating in the conference as an observer. It is clear simply from the participants how concerned and how much importance these countries attach to the issue of European peace and security.
    We, the Chinese people, know that world peace and security are indivisible. European peace and security are related not only to Europe but also to the whole world. The World Peace Council's meeting held recently in Stockholm focused on discussing the issue of guaranteeing European peace and security. This reflects the reasonable anxiety of the people of all countries, especially the people of European countries. Because, just when the world had generated hope that the international situation could be further eased due to the end of the Korean and Indochina wars and the rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty, the London and Paris agreements, which aim to revive West German militarism and create a new war, brought new threats to the people. Therefore, the resolution of the World Peace Council's Stockholm meeting called on "the people of all countries to oppose the ratification of the London and Paris agreements."
    The Soviet people are very clear about the harm that the revival of German militarism will bring to European and world peace, and about the noble goal of establishing a European collective security system. Professor A. Venediktov of Leningrad University, in response to those who maliciously slander the Soviet Union's promotion of collective security as having ulterior motives, said: "Yes, we have a purpose, but we openly state this purpose to the world: it is to maintain peace. We Soviet people paid a heavy price to save humanity from the plague of Hitlerism, and we must never allow this plague to resurface. During the Second World War, my country lost seven million people. Twenty-five million people lost their homes. All Soviet people, especially we Leningraders who suffered through the nine hundred days of siege, wholeheartedly support the proposal to establish a collective security system. What is so strange about that?"
    Based on the Soviet Union's previous proposals, we know that the Soviet Union hopes that all European countries, regardless of size, regardless of social and political systems, will mutually undertake obligations, resolve all disputes peacefully, use joint actions, including military actions, to stop any threat of aggression, and guarantee the security of all countries. In this way, the national reunification that the German people yearn for can also be achieved through peaceful consultation. The Soviet Union's proposal for this European collective security system has been supported by the broad masses of people in Europe.
    Countries that are truly working for peace obviously have no reason not to accept this proposal, which can indeed guarantee European peace and security. People remember that, as early as the Berlin Conference at the beginning of this year, the Soviet Union had already put forward a proposal on concluding an all-European treaty to guarantee European collective security. After the Geneva Conference, the Soviet government further successively sent notes to the French, British, and American governments, suggesting that an all-European conference be convened to study the issue of establishing a European collective security system. Even when the United States and its followers were actively carrying out activities to revive West German militarism, the Soviet Union once again suggested on October 23 that a meeting of the foreign ministers of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union be held in November of this year. On November 20, Molotov, in answering questions from a "Pravda" reporter, stated that if the debate on ratifying the Paris agreements was postponed, it would be possible to reach an agreement on another date for convening an all-European conference. However, the United States and its followers refused to consider all opinions related to convening a conference to discuss European collective security.
    Prominent figures in the U.S. government have expressed "good intentions" for negotiating and cooperating with the Soviet Union. The U.S.'s followers in Britain and France have also expressed the "goodwill" to build a "bridge" between Western and Eastern Europe. However, when it was necessary to show an attitude on whether to guarantee European security together with the European people or to revive West German militarism to oppose the European people, the fox wearing the mask of peace revealed its tail. They hurriedly signed the agreement in Paris to revive West German militarism. According to this sinful Paris agreement, West German revanchist forces will possess an army of 500,000 men, West German heavy industry will produce armaments on a large scale, and a rearmed West Germany will join the North Atlantic aggressive bloc and the Western European military alliance, which are aimed at opposing other European countries. In order to fool the public and public opinion, they insisted that only after this Paris agreement, which endangers European security, is ratified, can a conference to discuss European security be held. They attempted to use this to paralyze the resistance of the people of European countries to the ratification of the Paris agreements, and to quell the anger of the people of European countries at their refusal to participate in this conference to guarantee European peace and security. On the other hand, they attempted to accelerate the revival of West German militarism and incorporate West Germany into their own aggressive bloc, in order to strengthen their own forces, and then blackmail the Soviet Union and the Eastern European people's democratic countries "from a position of strength." But this kind of "strength" diplomacy has long proven that it cannot blackmail the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries; on the contrary, it puts the United States and its servants in an isolated position of being enemies with the people of Europe. The experience of the Second World War shows that those Western European countries that condoned and raised the Hitler gang not only failed to strengthen their own position, but ultimately only ended up getting burned themselves. Before the Paris agreements are ratified, all of this is worth pondering for them.
    It is completely reasonable and timely for peace-loving Soviet and European countries, in the current European situation, to study and decide on the necessary measures to guarantee the security of their own countries and Europe. The "Pravda" editorial said correctly: "There is no doubt that, in the new situation where urgent measures need to be taken to guarantee European peace and security, this conference will definitely become an important milestone on the road to solving this historical task."

### 为了欧洲和平和安全

    为了欧洲和平和安全
    本报记者  李何
    举世瞩目的欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议，今天（二十九日）在莫斯科开始工作了。
    一切真正拥护欧洲和世界和平的人们，都诚恳地欢迎这个由苏联发起的重要会议的召开，因为保卫欧洲和平和安全的斗争正处在一个紧要的关头。侵略势力企图迅速批准伦敦协定和巴黎协定，以便复活西德军国主义来制造新的战争。爱好和平的国家和人民必须以刻不容缓的共同努力，打破这个企图破坏柏林会议和日内瓦会议以后的国际和缓局势的新阴谋。
    参加这次保障欧洲和平和安全会议的，有苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚等欧洲国家由政府首长——部长会议主席、副主席或总理率领的代表团。中华人民共和国外交部副部长张闻天以观察员身份参加这次会议。仅仅从与会的人员就可看出：这些国家是多么关心和重视欧洲和平和安全问题。
    我们中国人民知道，世界和平和安全是不可分割的。欧洲和平和安全不但关系着欧洲，而且关系着全世界。世界和平理事会日前在斯德哥尔摩举行的会议，着重讨论了保障欧洲和平和安全问题。这反映了世界各国首先是欧洲各国人民的合理的焦虑。因为正当全世界由于朝鲜和印度支那战争结束以及“欧洲防务集团”条约被拒绝而产生了国际局势能够进一步缓和的希望的时候，以复活西德军国主义和制造新战争为目的的伦敦协定和巴黎协定，又给人们带来新的威胁。因此，世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议的决议号召“各国人民必须反对批准伦敦和巴黎协定”。
    苏联人民，对于德国军国主义的复活将会带给欧洲和世界和平的危害，对于建立欧洲集体安全体系的崇高目的，是非常清楚的。列宁格勒大学教授亚·维涅捷克托夫回答那些恶意诋毁苏联提倡集体安全是别有目的的人说：“是的，我们是有目的的，可是我们向全世界公开说出这个目的：它就是维护和平。我们苏联人，为了将人类从希特勒的瘟疫下拯救出来，化了重大的代价，我们决不能让这瘟疫重新流行。在第二次世界大战时期我的祖国损失了七百万人。二千五百万人失掉了家园。所有的苏联人，特别是我们遭受过九百天围城苦难的列宁格勒人，衷心拥护建立集体安全体系的主张，那有什么可奇怪呢。”
    根据苏联历次的建议，我们知道，苏联是希望：欧洲所有国家，不论大小，不管社会和政治制度，互相承担义务，用和平方式解决一切争端，用包括军事行动在内的联合行动来制止任何侵略的威胁，保证各国的安全。这样也就可以通过和平协商方式来实现德国人民所渴望的国家的统一。苏联这个欧洲集体安全体系的主张，得到欧洲广大人民的拥护。
    真正为和平而努力的国家，显然是没有理由不接受这种确实能够保障欧洲和平和安全的建议的。人们都记得，远在今年年初的柏林会议上，苏联就已提出关于缔结保障欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的建议。日内瓦会议以后，苏联政府更连续照会法、英、美政府，建议召开全欧会议以研究建立欧洲集体安全体系问题。甚至在美国及其追随者积极进行复活西德军国主义的活动的时候，苏联在十月二十三日再度建议在本年十一月召开法、英、美、苏四国外长会议。十一月二十日，莫洛托夫在答覆“真理报”记者问题时曾经表示，如果批准巴黎协定的辩论延期的话，就召开全欧会议的另外日期达成协议是可能的。但是美国及其追随者却拒绝考虑一切有关召开讨论欧洲集体安全的会议的意见。
    美国政府的显要人物曾经表示了和苏联谈判和合作的“好心”。美国在英、法的追随者也表示过要在西欧和东欧之间做搭“桥”工作的“善意”。但是当必须在和欧洲人民一起保障欧洲安全还是复活西德军国主义来反对欧洲人民这两条道路面前表明态度的时候，戴着和平面具的狐狸就露出了自己的尾巴。他们赶忙在巴黎签订了复活西德军国主义的协定。按照这个罪恶的巴黎协定，西德复仇主义势力将拥有一支五十万人的军队，西德的重工业将大规模生产军火，重新武装的西德将加入以反对其他欧洲国家为目的的北大西洋侵略集团和西欧军事联盟。为了愚弄公众和舆论，他们硬说，只有这种危害欧洲安全的巴黎协定被批准之后，才好举行讨论欧洲安全的会议。他们企图以此来麻痹欧洲各国人民对批准巴黎协定的反抗，以此来平息欧洲各国人民对他们拒绝参加此次保障欧洲和平和安全会议的愤怒。另一方面，他们企图加快复活西德军国主义和把西德纳入自己的侵略集团中，以加强自己的势力，然后“在实力的地位上”向苏联和东欧人民民主国家进行讹诈。但是这种“实力”外交手段早已证明讹诈不了苏联和人民民主国家；恰恰相反，它使得美国及其仆从们陷于和欧洲人民为敌的孤立处境。第二次世界大战的经验说明：纵容和豢养希特勒匪帮的那些西欧国家不但不能加强自己的地位，而且结果只会弄火烧身。在巴黎协定还没有批准之前，这一切是值得他们去寻味的。
    爱好和平的苏联和欧洲国家，在目前的欧洲形势下，研究和决定保障自己国家和欧洲的安全的必要措施，是完全合理和适时的。“真理报”社论说得对：“毫无疑问，在需要采取紧急措施来保障欧洲和平和安全的新的情况下，这次会议一定会成为通往解决这个历史性任务的道路上的重要里程碑。”十一月二十九日
