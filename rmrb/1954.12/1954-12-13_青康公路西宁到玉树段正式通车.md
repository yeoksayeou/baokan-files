Xinhua News Agency: The section of the Qingkang (Qinghai-Xikang) Highway from Xining to Yushu officially opened to traffic on the 5th. On that day, a traffic opening ceremony was held in Jiegu City, the capital of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region. 1,200 people attended the ceremony. At the meeting, Li Lunzhen, Secretary of the Yushu Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, presented a banner to the road construction workers on behalf of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Qinghai Provincial People's Government. After Zhaxi Caiwang Duojie, Chairman of the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government, cut the ribbon, trucks loaded with wool departed from Jiegu City for Xining.

The Qingkang Highway section from Xining to Yushu is 827 kilometers long and construction began in May 1953. During the road construction, the workers overcame many difficulties, improved road construction techniques, and carried out a production increase and economy drive. This year alone, they increased production and saved 10.5 billion yuan for the country. The Tibetan people along the route actively supported the road construction project, organizing yak teams to help with transportation. The Tibetan people of Yushu also grew more than 40,000 jin of vegetables for the road construction workers, and more than 500 people participated in the road construction project.

Transportation between Xining and Yushu used to take three months for a round trip by yak, but now it only takes half a month by truck.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 12th: From January to November this year, an average of 18 vehicles per day traveled the Qinghai-Tibet Highway section from Xining to Xiangride. The trucks transported grain, tea, cloth, wool shears, sickles, and other goods to the pastoral areas and transported furs, medicinal materials, and other goods from the pastoral areas.

The Qinghai-Tibet Highway section from Xining to Xiangride is more than 500 kilometers long. Renovation began in 1950, and freight trucks began operating in 1951. This section of the highway passes through five stations: Huangyuan, Daotanghe, Dalai Lama River, Chaka, and Chahanwusu. Huangyuan County is located at the intersection of agriculture and animal husbandry and is one of the fur distribution centers in Qinghai Province. Electric lights were installed here last year. Daotanghe is the first station after entering the pastoral area. From here, heading west along Qinghai Lake, our country's largest inland lake, is a vast grassland, where you can see herdsmen's tents and herds of cattle and sheep everywhere along the road. The famous Chaka Salt Lake is near the Chaka Station. This salt lake is about 100 li in circumference and contains a large amount of naturally crystallized salt, which is pure in quality and delicious in taste, and is sold far away in Sichuan, Xikang, and Gansu. Chahanwusu is the capital of the Haixi Mongolian, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Region.

    青康公路西宁到玉树段正式通车
    【新华社讯】青（青海）康（西康）公路西宁到玉树段已在五日正式通车。当天，在玉树藏族自治区首府结古市举行通车典礼。参加典礼的有一千二百人。会上，中共玉树地方委员会书记李伦振代表中共青海省委员会和青海省人民政府向筑路职工赠旗。玉树藏族自治区人民政府主席扎喜才旺多杰剪彩后，满载羊毛的汽车，从结古市开往西宁。
    青康公路西宁到玉树段全长八百二十七公里，从一九五三年五月开始修筑。筑路期间，职工们克服了许多困难，并改进筑路技术，开展增产节约运动。仅今年全年就给国家增产节约了一百零五亿元。沿路藏族人民积极支援了筑路工程，组织牦牛队帮助运输。玉树的藏族人民还给筑路职工们种植了四万多斤蔬菜，并有五百多人参加了筑路工程。
    西宁到玉树用牦牛运输往返要三个月的时间，现在汽车运输只需要半个月。
    据新华社西宁十二日电：青藏公路西宁到香日德段从今年一月到十一月，平均每天有十八辆汽车驶过。汽车把粮食、茶叶、布匹和羊毛剪刀、镰刀等运往牧区，又从牧区运回皮毛、药材等。
    青藏公路西宁到香日德段长达五百多公里。一九五零年开始整修，一九五一年开始行驶货运汽车。在这段公路上，要经过湟源、倒淌河、大喇嘛河、茶卡、察汗乌苏等五个站口。湟源县城位于农牧业交界的地方，是青海省皮毛集散地之一，去年这里就安装了电灯。倒淌河是进入牧业区后的第一个站口，从这里沿着我国最大的内陆湖——青海西行，都是辽阔的草原，路旁随处可看到牧民们的帐房和成群的牛羊。著名的茶卡盐池在茶卡车站附近。这个盐池周围长约一百多里，池内蕴藏有大量天然结晶盐，质纯味美，远销四川、西康、甘肃。察汗乌苏是海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治区的首府。
