The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a "Resolution on Several Tasks of the League in the Current Agricultural Cooperation Movement."

The resolution first pointed out the importance of the state's socialist transformation of agriculture. The resolution stated: The realization of this task will bring a better life to rural youth. At the same time, because of the arduousness and complexity of this task, it also gives rural youth a greater responsibility.

The resolution pointed out: As the Party's assistant and reserve force, the fundamental task of the Youth League organization in rural areas is to unite and organize youth to actively participate in agricultural cooperation and agricultural production increase movement centered on mutual aid and cooperation under the close leadership of the Party, and to cultivate the vast number of young people into a new generation with a high degree of socialist consciousness, certain cultural and scientific knowledge, and the ability to master advanced agricultural technology, to struggle to support the country's socialist industrialization and victoriously realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. In order to achieve this task, the League organization must further develop its regular work in the following main aspects: First, strengthen the socialist ideological education of young people and give full play to the initiative and creativity of young people in mutual aid and cooperation and labor production; second, vigorously organize young people to learn agricultural technical knowledge and promote advanced agricultural production increase experience according to the needs and possibilities of the time and place; third, organize cultural learning and carry out appropriate mass cultural activities in accordance with the principle of voluntary participation of the masses and local specific conditions; fourth, with the development of the cooperative movement and the improvement of the political consciousness of young people, continuously expand and consolidate the League organization.

The resolution stated: According to the Party's general line in the transition period, persistently and systematically carrying out political and ideological education to the vast number of young people and raising the socialist consciousness of young people is the foundation for the Youth League to do all its work well. Through propaganda and education, firmly establish the rural youth's love for agricultural labor, peace of mind in agricultural production, and the determination to resolutely take the socialist road.

Now we are facing a new situation in the further development of the agricultural cooperation movement. The League organization should regard the agricultural production cooperative as a school for socialist education for rural youth. Obeying the cooperative's charter and striving to be a model member should become the glorious slogan of action for every young person in the cooperative, especially the Youth League members. It is necessary to educate League members and youth to strengthen the unity of youth inside and outside the cooperative and inside and outside the group with the socialist spirit, and to implement the principle of using the advanced to help the backward.

When the Youth League carries out political and ideological education to the vast number of young people, it must regard organizing League members and the vast number of young people to actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement and improving agricultural production as a process of constantly overcoming and transforming their selfish psychology and conservative thinking, constantly eliminating the influence of capitalist ideology and improving socialist consciousness.

The resolution pointed out when talking about vigorously organizing young people to learn agricultural technology: The technical level of rural youth is generally low, but they are eager to learn, accept new things quickly, and are brave to break old habits. As long as the League organization is good at organizing and encouraging them to learn, they can become an active force in agricultural technology reform. Under the vigorous advocacy of the Party and the People's Government, some new technical measures have been adopted in various places, and a lot of production increase experience has been created. The League organization should actively organize young people to learn and promote them. When adopting any technical reform measures, it is necessary to advocate learning scientific knowledge and also pay attention to learning the production increase experience from older farmers. All subjectivism and formalism should be prevented. Good initiatives and creations of rural youth in improving agricultural production should be actively supported.

The resolution stated: The rapid development of agricultural cooperation urgently requires a large number of accountants, technicians, and drivers. Paying attention to and improving the political quality and professional proficiency of these personnel is of great importance to running the cooperative well. The Youth League has the responsibility to select outstanding League members and youth to study in various technical training classes sponsored by the government and strengthen their work in all aspects. It must be recognized that new technical talents in agriculture in the future will mainly be cultivated from the younger generation.

The resolution also required the League organizations in various places to strengthen the leadership of the youth staff in state-owned farms, agricultural experiment stations, new agricultural implement stations, tractor stations, and technology promotion stations, and guide them to closely contact the masses, work diligently, and spread scientific knowledge to the vast number of young people and farmers.

The resolution pointed out: With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the improvement of the material life of the masses, the vast number of rural youth have an increasingly strong desire to learn culture and enliven cultural life. The League organization must regard organizing rural youth's cultural learning and carrying out mass cultural activities as a regular and important task.

People's schools and winter schools are the main places for rural youth to learn cultural and scientific knowledge. The Youth League must become the backbone force in people's schools and winter schools. The League organization should cooperate with relevant parties to actively solve the serious difficulty of lacking popular books and periodicals in rural areas. The rural libraries and mobile book boxes that have been established in many places now have good results and should be advocated and promoted in a planned way.

The League organization should actively advocate recreational and sports activities that are beneficial to the physical and mental health of rural youth, and run rural clubs and amateur theater troupes with a plan and leadership, and organize the activities of various literary and artistic and sports groups. When carrying out various cultural activities, it is necessary to adopt a variety of activity methods and resolutely abide by the principles of voluntariness and service to production.

A large number of graduates from senior elementary schools and junior high schools participate in agricultural production in rural areas every year. They are a new force in rural work. The League organization should also seriously educate them.

The resolution pointed out: There are now more than 290,000 grass-roots League organizations in rural areas, with 6 million League members. Although this is already a considerable force, neither the number nor the quality of League members can meet the needs of the development of the cooperative movement and the progressive demands of the vast number of young people. The rural League organization must have further development and strengthening. The resolution stated: All grass-roots League organizations must take developing League members as their regular work, and promptly receive those young people who resolutely support the socialist cause, work actively, and are willing to abide by the League Constitution into the League, and pay attention to focusing on developing members in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups preparing to transfer to cooperatives. While strengthening the development of the League organization, we should also strengthen the management and leadership of existing League members and grass-roots organizations.

The resolution finally stated: Continuing to improve the League's leadership methods and working methods is an important guarantee for realizing the above-mentioned tasks. League committees at all levels must face the grass-roots level and the masses, and strengthen specific guidance to grass-roots organizations. It is necessary to continue to vigorously advocate working in a down-to-earth manner and learning modestly. League committees at all levels must earnestly listen to the voices of the masses and criticisms from below, and lead comrades below by example to pay attention to discovering shortcomings and errors in their work, and constantly prevent and overcome any exaggeration and pride in practical work.

    青年团中央发布关于当前团在农业合作化运动中几项工作的决议
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会发布了“关于当前团在农业合作化运动中几项工作的决议”。
    决议首先指出国家对农业进行社会主义改造的重要意义。决议说：这个任务的实现，将给农村青年带来更加美好的生活，同时，由于这个任务的艰巨和复杂，也赋予农村青年以更重大的责任。
    决议指出：作为党的助手和后备军，青年团组织在农村中的根本任务，就是要在党的密切领导下，团结和组织青年积极参加农业合作化和以互助合作为中心的农业增产运动，把广大青年培养成为具有高度的社会主义觉悟、一定的文化科学知识、能够掌握先进农业技术的新的一代，为支持国家社会主义工业化、胜利地实现对农业的社会主义改造而斗争。为了实现这一任务，团的组织就必须从以下几个主要方面进一步展开自己的经常工作，这就是：第一，加强对青年的社会主义思想教育，充分发挥青年在互助合作和劳动生产中的积极性和创造性；第二，根据当时当地的需要和可能，大力组织青年学习农业技术知识和推广农业先进增产经验；第三，按照群众自愿原则和当地具体条件，组织文化学习和适当开展群众文化活动；第四，随着合作化运动的发展和青年政治觉悟的提高，不断地壮大和巩固团的组织。
    决议说：根据党在过渡时期的总路线，坚持不懈地系统地向广大青年进行政治思想教育，提高青年的社会主义觉悟，是青年团做好一切工作的基础。通过宣传和教育，巩固地树立农村青年热爱农业劳动，安心农业生产，和坚决走社会主义道路的思想和决心。
    现在我们正面临着农业合作化运动进一步发展的新形势。团的组织要把农业生产合作社当作对农村青年进行社会主义教育的学校。遵守社章，争取做一个模范社员，应该成为社内每个青年首先是青年团员的光荣的行动口号。要教育团员和青年，以社会主义精神加强社内外、组内外青年的团结，贯彻以先进帮助落后的原则。
    青年团对广大青年进行政治思想教育时，必须把组织团员和广大青年积极参加互助合作运动和提高农业生产等工作，看做是不断地克服和改造他们的自私心理和保守思想，不断地排除资本主义思想影响和提高社会主义觉悟的过程。
    决议在谈到大力组织青年学习农业技术时指出：农村青年技术水平一般较低，但求知心切，接受新鲜事物较快，勇于打破陈规陋习，只要团的组织善于组织和鼓励他们学习，他们就可以成为农业技术改革中的一支活跃力量。在党和人民政府的大力倡导下，现在各地都采用了一些新的技术措施，创造了不少增产经验，团的组织应该积极组织青年去学习和加以推广。在采用任何技术改革措施时，既要提倡学习科学知识，也要重视向老年农民学习增产经验。应当防止一切主观主义和形式主义的作法。对于农村青年在提高农业生产中好的倡议和创造，要积极加以支持。
    决议说：农业合作化的迅速发展，迫切地需要大量的会计员、技术员和驾驶员。注意和提高这些人员的政治质量和业务的熟练程度，对办好合作社有重大的作用。青年团有责任选派优秀的团员和青年，到政府主办的各种技术训练班学习，并从各方面加强对他们的工作。要认识，未来农业上的新的技术人材将主要由青年一代中培养起来。
    决议还要求各地团组织加强对国营农场、农业试验场、新式农具站、拖拉机站、技术推广站的青年工作人员的领导，引导他们密切联系群众、勤勤恳恳地工作，把科学知识传播给广大青年和农民。
    决议指出：随着互助合作运动的发展和群众物质生活的改善，广大农村青年愈来愈强烈地要求学习文化，活跃文化生活。团的组织必须把组织农村青年的文化学习，开展群众文化活动，当作一件经常的重要工作去做。
    民校和冬学，是农村青年学习文化科学知识的主要场所，青年团必须成为民校和冬学中的骨干力量。团的组织要同有关方面配合，积极解决目前农村中缺少通俗书刊的严重困难。现在许多地方创办的农村图书馆和流动图书箱，收效很好，应该有计划地加以倡导和推广。
    团的组织要积极地倡导有益于农村青年身心健康的文娱和体育活动，有计划有领导地办好农村俱乐部和业余剧团，组织各种文艺、体育小组的活动。在进行各种文化活动时，必须采用多种多样的活动方式，坚决遵守自愿和为生产服务的原则。
    农村中每年都有大量的高小和初中毕业生参加农业生产，他们是农村工作中的一支新生力量。团的组织也应认真对他们进行教育。
    决议中指出：现在农村团的基层组织已有二十九万多个，团员达六百万，这虽然已经是一支不小的队伍，但是不论就团员的数量或质量来说，都还不能适应合作化运动发展的需要和广大青年的进步要求。农村团的组织必须有进一步的发展和加强。决议说：一切团的基层组织，都要把发展团员作为自己经常的工作，及时地将那些坚决拥护社会主义事业、工作积极和愿意遵守团章的青年接收到团内来，并注意把发展重点放在农业生产合作社和准备转社的互助组里面。在加强团的组织发展的同时，还应加强已有团员和基层组织的管理和领导。
    决议最后说道：继续改进团的领导方法和工作方法，是实现上述各项工作任务的重要保证。各级团委都必须面向基层，面向群众，加强对基层组织的具体指导。必须继续大力提倡踏实地工作，虚心地学习。各级团委都要认真地倾听群众的呼声和来自下面的批评，以身作则地引导下面同志着重注意发现工作中的缺点和错误，在实际工作中经常防止和克服任何虚夸和骄傲的现象。
