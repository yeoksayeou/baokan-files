Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 6th: According to TASS, Berlin democratic newspapers published a communique from the Press Office of the German Democratic Republic on the 5th. The communique stated: On December 4th, the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, reported to the meeting of the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic on the situation of the European countries' conference and the joint declaration on guaranteeing European peace and security adopted by the participating countries. The Council of Ministers approved Grotewohl's report and his signature on the joint declaration.

In his report, Prime Minister Grotewohl said: The principles formulated by the participating countries in the joint declaration demonstrate the unanimous determination of the participating countries to oppose the aggressive bloc seeking to ratify the Paris Agreements with the united strength of peace-loving countries in order to guarantee their security. Grotewohl pointed out the great significance of some of the propositions in the declaration.

On the same day, the President of the German Democratic Republic, Wilhelm Pieck, received the delegation of the German Democratic Republic participating in the European countries' conference at the Presidential Palace and listened to the delegation's report on the European countries' conference. President Pieck expressed complete satisfaction with the results of the European countries' conference and pointed out that the German people should strive to stop the revival of German militarism and promote the early restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis for the sake of establishing peace and security in Europe.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 6th: According to TASS, the delegation of the German Democratic Republic participating in the Moscow Conference of European Countries on Guaranteeing European Peace and Security held a press conference in Berlin on the 4th, attended by many German and foreign newspaper reporters.

Prime Minister Grotewohl, the head of the delegation, emphasized at the press conference that the discussion of the issue of guaranteeing European security is closely related to the issues concerning the entire German people.

Grotewohl also pointed out that the countries participating in the conference unanimously stated that the aggressive West German militarism, which had caused countless disasters to their people, must not be revived. The countries participating in the conference agreed with the Soviet Union's proposal that in order to guarantee their own security, the peace-loving countries of Europe should accumulate their strength and greatly strengthen this strength once the Paris Agreements are ratified and implemented.

Grotewohl said that the starting point of the Moscow Conference declaration is that a small group of German imperialists must be prevented from launching another European war.

Grotewohl said that the German people believe that the four major powers bear full responsibility for restoring German unity, but the German people should use all possible means to reach an all-German agreement in order to hold free all-German elections and restore German unity on a democratic and peaceful basis. The slogan "Germans, sit down at a table together!" is still valid.

Grotewohl talked about the issue of holding free all-German elections, saying that the German Democratic Republic does not propose any preconditions in resolving the issue of holding all-German elections.

Grotewohl then pointed out that if the Paris Agreements are ratified, the German Democratic Republic is determined to guarantee its own security and the peaceful labor of its residents.

Grotewohl finally emphasized that the resolutions of the Moscow Conference will force the promoters of "policy of strength" to more soberly estimate the current political situation. He also pointed out what the representative of the People's Republic of China said at the Moscow Conference: The government of the People's Republic of China agrees with this declaration and supports the propositions put forward in the declaration.

Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: Bonn dispatch: Before and after the meeting of European countries guaranteeing European peace and security, the struggle of German patriots against the ratification of the Paris Agreements, against the rearmament of West Germany, and for mutual understanding between the people of the East and West parts of Germany has intensified.

People from all over the country have submitted requests to the West German parliament opposing the ratification of the Paris Agreements. The working people of the German Democratic Republic called on their compatriots in West Germany to do everything possible to strive for the conclusion of an all-German agreement.

In an appeal to the Senate of Hesse, the People's Chamber of the Frankfurt/Oder district called on every patriotic and upright German to step forward to safeguard the happy future of the people.

Members of the Erfurt organization of the German National Democratic Party demanded that the parliamentary groups of the Bonn Federal Assembly not allow the Paris Agreements to be ratified, because the Paris Agreements would deepen the division of Germany, make the peaceful restoration of unity impossible, and create new dangers for peace in Europe. Leaders of a miners' union in Essen and teachers in Querfurt, Halle district, also made similar demands to members of the Federal Assembly.

In Solingen, workers in many steel factories passed resolutions against the rearmament of West Germany and against conscription, and they supported the resolution of the Third Congress of the West German Trade Union Federation against the rearmament of West Germany.

In Hamburg, hundreds of women held a demonstration against the Paris Agreements and demanding consultations between East and West Germany. In leaflets distributed by them, they wrote: "Peace is threatened by the Paris Agreements, so we women firmly oppose the Paris Agreements and demand that the Federal Government adopt a policy of understanding with the peoples of all countries." They called on Hamburg residents to participate in the struggle against conscription.

Youth in Gelsenkirchen and Nuremberg have also recently held demonstrations against remilitarization. In Bremerhaven, young people gathered to establish a committee against compulsory military service. In Rhineland-Palatinate, fifty-one young people have been arrested and interrogated by the Bonn authorities for actively engaging in the struggle against conscription.

    德国人民坚决反对西德重新武装
    民主德国部长会议批准格罗提渥的报告
    西德爱国人士加强反对巴黎协定的斗争
    【新华社六日讯】　据塔斯社柏林五日讯：柏林民主报纸五日刊载了德意志民主共和国总理新闻处的公报。公报说：十二月四日，德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥在德意志民主共和国部长会议的会议上报告了欧洲国家会议的情况和与会各国通过的关于保障欧洲和平和安全的联合宣言。部长会议批准了格罗提渥的报告和他在联合宣言上的签署。
  格罗提渥总理在报告中说：与会各国在联合宣言中所制定的原则，表现了与会各国一致决心以爱好和平国家的联合力量来反对力图批准巴黎协定的侵略集团，以保障它们的安全。格罗提渥指出了宣言中的一些主张的巨大意义。
    同一天，德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克在总统府接见了参加欧洲国家会议的德意志民主共和国代表团，并且听取了代表团关于欧洲国家会议的报告。皮克总统对欧洲国家会议的结果表示完全满意，并指出：德国人民应该努力制止复活德国军国主义，并为确立欧洲的和平和安全而促使德国早日在和平和民主的基础上恢复统一。
    【新华社六日讯】　据塔斯社柏林五日讯：德意志民主共和国参加欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全的莫斯科会议的代表团四日在柏林举行记者招待会，参加招待会的有许多德国和外国报纸的记者。
    代表团团长格罗提渥总理在招待会上着重指出，保障欧洲安全问题的讨论，同关涉到全体德国人民的问题有着紧密的关系。
    格罗提渥并且指出，参加会议的国家一致表示，不能让那曾经给它们的人民造成无数灾难的侵略性的西德军国主义复活。参加会议的国家同意了苏联的建议：为了保障自己的安全，欧洲爱好和平的国家应当在巴黎协定一旦批准和实施时，积聚自己的力量并且大大加强这种力量。
    格罗提渥说，莫斯科会议宣言的出发点是：必须阻止一小撮德国帝国主义分子再来发动欧洲战争。
    格罗提渥说，德国人民认为四大国对恢复德国统一负有完全的责任，但是德国人民应当利用一切可能达成全德的协议，以便举行全德自由选举，在民主和和平的基础上恢复德国统一。“德国人，坐在一张桌子旁来！”的口号仍然是有效的。
    格罗提渥谈到举行全德自由选举的问题，他说：德意志民主共和国在解决有关举行全德选举问题上，不提出任何先决条件。
    格罗提渥接着指出，如果批准了巴黎协定，德意志民主共和国决心保障自身的安全和居民的和平劳动。
    格罗提渥最后着重指出，莫斯科会议的决议将迫使“实力政策”的推行者比较清醒地估计当前的政治形势。他还指出了中华人民共和国代表在莫斯科会议上所说的话：中华人民共和国政府同意这一宣言，支持宣言中所提出的主张。
    【新华社六日讯】　波恩消息：在欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议开会前后，德国爱国人士反对批准巴黎协定，反对重新武装西德，争取德国东、西两部分人民相互了解的斗争加强了。
    全国各地人民纷纷向西德的议会提出反对批准巴黎协定的要求。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民号召西德的同胞们尽一切力量争取缔结全德协定。
    奥得河畔的法兰克福专区人民议院在致黑森州参议院的呼吁书中号召每一个爱国和正直的德国人，挺身而出维护人民的幸福未来。
    德国国家民主党欧法特组织的党员们要求波恩联邦议院各党团，不要让巴黎协定获得批准，因为巴黎协定会加深德国的分裂，使和平恢复统一不能实现，为欧洲的和平制造出新的危险。埃森某地区的矿工工会的领导者们和哈雷专区克维尔法特的教师们也向联邦议院议员们提出类似的要求。
    在索林根，许多钢铁工厂的工人通过决议，反对重新武装西德和反对征兵，他们支持西德工会联合会第三次代表大会关于反对重新武装西德的决议。
    在汉堡，数百名妇女举行了一次反对巴黎协定、要求东西德协商的示威游行。她们在散发的传单中写道：“和平正受到巴黎协定的威胁，因此我们妇女们坚决反对巴黎协定，要求联邦政府采取同各国人民谅解的政策。”她们号召汉堡居民参加反对征兵的斗争。
    盖尔生基森和纽伦堡的青年最近也举行了反对重新军国主义化的示威游行。在不来梅港，青年们集会成立了一个反对强迫兵役制的委员会。在莱因兰—帕拉丁耐特州，有五十一个青年因为积极进行反征兵的斗争，遭到了波恩当局的逮捕和审讯。
