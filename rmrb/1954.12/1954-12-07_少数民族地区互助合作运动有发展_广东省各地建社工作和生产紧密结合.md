The mutual aid and cooperation movement in minority areas has greatly developed. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, more than 1,300 agricultural production cooperatives have been established, along with more than 118,000 various mutual aid teams. The number of organized farming households accounts for about 70 percent of the total. In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, more than 200 agricultural production cooperatives have been established, along with more than 50,000 year-round mutual aid teams and 140,000 seasonal mutual aid teams. The number of organized farming households accounts for 55.8 percent of the total. In the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region of Hunan Province, more than 20 agricultural production cooperatives have been established, along with more than 32,300 mutual aid teams. The number of organized farming households accounts for about 40 percent of the total. In the Northeast, 85 percent of Korean farming households have participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. In the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region alone, more than 870 agricultural production cooperatives have been established, and the number of organized farmers has reached 86.3 percent of the total farming households in the region. Many mutual aid and cooperative organizations composed of farmers from two or more ethnic groups have also emerged in various regions. For example, the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has 56 Mongolian and Han households. They care for each other in life, teach and learn from each other in production, and respect each other's customs. In Hebei Province, there are more than ten agricultural production cooperatives jointly organized by Han and Hui farmers. The Hui people scattered in the countryside used to have less land than the Han people, lacked draught animals, farm tools, and farming techniques, so they had some difficulties in production and life. Through the agricultural production cooperatives jointly organized by Han and Hui farmers, the Hui farmers learned and improved their farming techniques with the help of the Han farmers, and solved the difficulties of insufficient livestock, farm tools, and land to a certain extent, and achieved increased production like the Han farmers.

Thanks to their organization, farmers of all ethnic groups have generally increased production and improved their lives. In Lingguan and Leidong, two small mountain villages in Liping, Guizhou Province, the 102 Dong households, due to the organization of mutual aid teams, changed the slash-and-burn cultivation methods of the past and improved production. Last year, 41 poor households had enough grain to eat for a year, and 19 of them had surplus grain to sell to the state. (Feng Hangguan)

The 7,400-plus agricultural production cooperatives that began to be established in Guangdong Province in October had 1,300-plus completed by mid-November, 2,300-plus completed land valuation, and most of the others are in the first stage of cooperative building. After the autumn harvest began, these newly established cooperatives have successively shifted to autumn harvest and winter planting, and took the lead in selling surplus grain to the state.

These newly established cooperatives were all established on the basis of better mutual aid teams, and the key personnel for cooperative building were trained before the establishment. According to incomplete statistics from the eastern and western Guangdong regions, more than 60,000 district and township cadres and key personnel for cooperative building have been trained. Therefore, these new cooperatives generally have a strong group of key personnel.

All localities have closely integrated cooperative building with production. For example, in central Guangdong, cooperative building was combined with drought resistance, which led the masses to rescue 720,000 mu of drought-stricken paddy fields. In western Guangdong, according to incomplete statistics from eight counties including Yangchun and Wuchuan, 1,181 cooperatives accumulated more than 2.72 million dan of fertilizer for winter planting during cooperative building. The promotion of production has also promoted the development and consolidation of mutual aid teams. Sihui County consolidated and improved 1,746 mutual aid teams and developed 466 mutual aid teams while building cooperatives. Many mutual aid teams also organized joint team mutual aid activities to create conditions for transitioning to cooperatives. (Our correspondent from Guangdong)

    少数民族地区互助合作运动有发展
    广东省各地建社工作和生产紧密结合
    各少数民族地区互助合作运动，有了很大的发展。内蒙古自治区已建立了一千三百多个农业生产合作社，各种互助组有十一万八千多个，组织起来的农户占总农户的百分之七十左右。广西省桂西僮族自治区也建成农业生产合作社二百多个，常年互助组五万多个，季节性互助组十四万个，组织起来的农户已占总农户的百分之五十五点八。湖南省湘西苗族自治区已建立农业生产合作社二十多个，互助组三万二千三百多个，组织起来的农户占全区总农户的百分之四十左右。全东北的朝鲜族已有百分之八十五的农户参加了互助合作组织，仅延边朝鲜族自治区就已建立了八百七十多个农业生产合作社，组织起来的农民已达全区总农户的百分之八十六点三。各地还出现了很多由两个以上民族的农民组成的互助合作组织。如内蒙古自治区的红星农业生产合作社，共有五十六户蒙民和汉民，他们在生活上互相关心，生产上实行互教互学，在风俗习惯上，也互相尊重。河北省有十几个汉、回两族农民共同组织的农业生产合作社。散居在农村中的回民，过去他们的土地一般比汉民的少，缺乏耕畜农具和耕种技术，因此生产上和生活上都或多或少地存在着若干困难，经过汉回农民联合组织的农业生产合作社，回族农民在汉族农民帮助下，学会和提高了耕作技术，在一定程度上解决了牲畜农具和土地不足等困难，和汉族农民一样得到了增产。
    各族农民由于组织起来，普遍增加了生产，改善了生活。贵州黎平的岭管、雷洞两个小山村的一百零二户侗族农民，由于组织互助组，改变了过去刀耕火种的耕作方法，提高了生产，去年有四十一户贫农的粮食够吃一年，其中还有十九户贫农有余粮卖给国家。　（冯函馆）
    广东省十月份开始建立的七千四百多个农业生产合作社，到十一月中旬已建成的有一千三百多个，结束土地评产等工作的有二千三百多个，其他的多在进行建社的第一步工作。秋收开始后，这批新建的社都已先后转入秋收冬种，并带头把余粮卖给国家。
    这批新建社都是在较好的互助组基础上建立的，并且在建社前对办社骨干又都经过了训练，据粤东、粤西两个区不完全统计，共训练了区乡干部和办社骨干六万多人。因此，这批新社一般都有一批较强的骨干。
    各地在建社中都紧密结合生产，如粤中区在建社中结合进行抗旱，带动群众抢救了受旱稻田七十二万亩；粤西区据阳春、吴川等八个县的不完全统计，一千一百八十一个社在建社中共积得冬种肥料二百七十二万多担。由于搞好生产，也推动了互助组的发展和巩固，四会县在建社同时巩固提高了一千七百四十六个互助组，发展了四百六十六个互助组。许多互助组为创造转社条件，还组织联组互助活动。　（本报广东记者站）
