The machinery industry is the foundation for the technological transformation of all sectors of the national economy. During the period of the First Five-Year Plan, China's machinery industry must guarantee the supply of domestically manufactured equipment needed for the construction of heavy industry, defense industry, transportation industry, and light industry in terms of product variety, quality, and quantity. It must strive to manufacture semi-mechanized production tools for agriculture, and necessary modern equipment for handicrafts, fisheries, forestry, and private industry, so as to consolidate and promote the development of the national socialist transformation cause from a technical perspective. These tasks are glorious and arduous. However, the current situation of China's machinery industry is not fully adapted to these tasks.

What is the current situation of China's machinery industry? From the perspective of the overall balance between production and needs, on the one hand, the products of the machinery industry cannot yet meet the needs of national construction, and approximately half of the value of newly added equipment must be imported from abroad each year. On the other hand, there is a serious backlog of certain products. The value of products stockpiled by enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building alone exceeds 10 trillion yuan, and some enterprises have a large portion of their equipment capacity unutilized. From the perspective of the distribution of major equipment usage, some enterprises have too much equipment used to manufacture general products, while there is too little equipment used to manufacture large, precision products.

There are two main reasons for these imbalances. First, China's machinery industry was in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal position in the past, and could only repair machines. The equipment conditions were originally very poor, and manufacturing technology was very low. After several years of rectification, supplementation, and improvement, it can only manufacture general, ordinary, medium, and small-sized machinery. Large, technologically complex, precision machines and complete sets of equipment cannot be manufactured. In addition, some enterprise management cadres, in developing production, only pay attention to increasing output, while neglecting to increase variety and improve quality. Therefore, although many types of equipment can be manufactured, the variety of specifications is small, and the quality is low, which cannot meet the needs of the country. Second, China's machinery industry is too dispersed. Apart from a very small number of larger-scale factories under the separate leadership of the First Ministry of Machine Building and relevant departments, most factories are under the leadership of local governments at all levels, or are owned by capitalists. In the process of transforming and developing these factories, due to the lack of unified national planning guidance in the past, coupled with the fact that some leading organs and enterprise management cadres did not regularly study national needs, or were stimulated by the blind processing and ordering of some units, there was a certain degree of blind development.

To completely overcome the imbalanced situation in the machinery industry's production, the main reliance is on the state building a batch of modern large factories and renovating a batch of existing factories, but this will take a relatively long time to achieve. The main methods to solve the problem at present are: first, to bring the national machinery industry into the orbit of national planning, that is, to rationally organize the national machinery industry according to national needs, so as to overcome and prevent blind development; second, to gradually expand product varieties and gradually improve the level of manufacturing technology through the planned trial production of new products according to national needs. These two tasks are indispensable. If we only bring the machinery industry into the orbit of national planning, but do not actively expand product varieties and improve the level of manufacturing technology, then China's machinery industry will never be able to meet the needs of national construction. Similarly, if we do not bring the national machinery industry into the orbit of national planning and rationally organize it, then the phenomenon of repeated manufacturing of certain products, while other products are not manufactured, will still occur. Products that could have been concentrated in a portion of factories for batch production are scattered in many factories for piecemeal production, which will hinder the reduction of manufacturing costs, disperse the technical forces for new product trial production, and hinder the rapid improvement of technical levels. At the same time, it will not effectively overcome the phenomenon of production being out of touch with needs. This is very detrimental to the country.

In order to effectively bring the national machinery industry into the orbit of national planning, it is necessary to implement the principle of "production determined by sales." This means that more of what the country needs more of should be produced, less of what the country needs less of should be produced, and what is not needed should not be produced. Whether it is state-owned, locally state-owned, or private machinery industry, what to produce, how much to produce, where to obtain raw materials, and where to sell products must be carried out in accordance with the national plan. At present, this planning must be gradually strengthened. All major equipment necessary for national basic construction, important equipment in the national economy such as transportation and agriculture, or equipment requiring high manufacturing technology and products produced in large quantities, must be uniformly planned, organized for production, supplied with raw materials, and distributed by relevant central departments in order to effectively guarantee needs and facilitate unified specifications and lower costs. For daily necessities that are in great demand but have simple specifications, the central government should uniformly plan, and local governments should organize production separately and sell them uniformly. For products with many specifications, small demand, or regional characteristics, users and production units should be responsible for balancing supply to ensure supply. As for those small, unimportant, and scattered products, factories can temporarily produce and sell them themselves, but local and relevant units should still make appropriate arrangements, and then bring them into the orbit of national planning when conditions are ripe. The scale, equipment capacity, and manufacturing technology of China's existing machinery factories are different. Some are suitable for manufacturing this product, while others are suitable for manufacturing that product. In order to give full play to their strengths, they should be given appropriate division of labor. In addition, the proportion of private machinery industry is still quite large, and it has a certain manufacturing technology, so it is necessary to bring them into the orbit of national planning in a focused, conditional, and step-by-step manner in accordance with the policy of utilization, restriction, and transformation.

The major projects that the state must build in the First Five-Year Plan have been determined, and the main equipment needed by industry, agriculture, and transportation has also been roughly determined. This creates favorable conditions for the machinery industry to produce according to plan. Now, each enterprise and each relevant industrial leading department should combine with users, systematically study the situation of production and needs, and conduct repeated and thorough calculations and balances. Some factory cadres are only willing to manufacture large, high-profit, high-output value products that are easy to manufacture. They disregard the enterprise's equipment conditions and technical level, and compete with enterprises with relatively high technology and better equipment conditions everywhere. As a result, some products are repeatedly manufactured, while other products are not manufactured by anyone. This situation once existed quite seriously. Although it has changed somewhat, attention should still be paid to overcoming and preventing it. It is an important condition for ensuring that the machinery industry is brought into the orbit of national planning and ensuring product quality that departments using equipment promptly and specifically and accurately put forward the required product specifications and quantities so that production departments can prepare for production as early as possible. The phenomena of "late ordering," "urgent needs," "rapid changes," "slow returns," "vague requirements," and blind ordering that exist in the current ordering work must also be overcome.

While increasing planning, the machinery industry must also gradually expand product varieties and improve manufacturing technology levels on the basis of a reasonable division of labor. This is the direction of development for every machinery manufacturing factory. In recent years, the machinery industry has manufactured more than 1,000 relatively important new products, meeting certain needs of national construction and promoting the improvement of machinery industry manufacturing technology. However, the new product trial production plan of the machinery industry has not been completed well. Many of the equipment required for key construction projects have not been received in time, or the quality of the equipment received is not good. The main reasons for not completing the new product trial production plan are: first, the technical force is weak. After expanding product varieties, many enterprises generally feel that the technical force is insufficient. Product design drawings are not supplied in time, or the technical preparation work for trial production is not done in a timely manner; second, there is a lack of management experience in organizing multi-variety production in an enterprise. Trial production work often cannot be carried out according to plan. Therefore, we must strive to strengthen production technology preparation work in the future, and at the same time implement the standardization and standardization of parts of the same type of products. According to existing experience, doing a good job in production technology preparation before production in a planned manner can also enable the production of multiple products to be carried out strictly according to the operation plan, avoid production confusion, and thus accelerate the speed of new product manufacturing.

It should be pointed out that in a modern machine manufacturing factory, there must be practical and feasible advanced operating procedures, a set of strict management systems, and an operation plan that organically organizes the entire factory in order to carry out production normally. This requires overcoming the free and undisciplined habits and handicraft methods left over from the repair period in the past, and seriously learning from the Soviet Union's advanced management experience and technical experience, and applying them according to the specific conditions of the enterprise. At the same time, it is necessary to summarize and promote existing advanced experience, and pay attention to cultivating and supplementing product design forces and strengthening production technology preparation work. Only in this way can the planning of the machinery industry be strengthened and the level of manufacturing technology be rapidly improved.

    机械工业要加强计划性，提高制造技术水平
    机械工业是国民经济一切部门实行技术改造的基础。在第一个五年计划建设时期，我国机械工业必须从产品品种、质量、数量等各方面，保证供应重工业、国防工业、交通运输业和轻工业建设所需要在国内制造的设备，必须努力为农业制造半机械化的生产工具，为手工业、渔业、林业和私营工业制造必要的现代设备，以便从技术方面巩固和促进国家社会主义改造事业的发展。这些任务是光荣的，也是艰巨的。但我国机械工业的现状跟这些任务不是完全能够适应的。
    我国机械工业的现状是怎样的呢？从生产和需要的总平衡来看，一方面机械工业的产品还不能满足国家建设的需要，每年约有占新添设备价值一半左右的设备必须依靠国外进口；另一方面，某些产品又有严重的积压，仅第一机械工业部所属企业积压的产品价值就有一万余亿元之多，某些企业还有很大一部分设备能力没有发挥。从主要设备使用的分配情况来看，某些企业用来制造一般产品的设备过多，用来制造大型的、精密的产品的设备则太少。
    造成这些不平衡状况的有两个主要原因。一是我国机械工业在过去处于半殖民地半封建的地位，只能修配机器，设备条件本来就很差，制造技术很低，经过几年来的整顿、补充和提高，也只能制造一般的普通的中小型机械。大型的、技术复杂的、精密的机器和成套设备就制造不了。加上某些企业管理干部在发展生产中，只注意增加产量，而忽视增加品种，忽视提高质量，所以有许多设备虽然能够制造，但品种规格少，质量低，不能满足国家的需要。二是我国机械工业太分散。除了为数极少但规模较大的由第一机械工业部及有关各部门分别领导以外，大多数工厂都分别属于各级地方政府领导，或者属于资本家所有。这些工厂在改造和发展过程中，由于过去缺乏统一的国家计划的指导，再加上某些领导机关和企业管理干部又没有经常研究国家需要，或受了某些单位盲目加工订货的刺激，所以有一定程度的盲目发展的偏向。
    要彻底克服机械工业生产的不平衡情况，主要是靠国家新建一批现代化的大工厂和改建一批现有工厂，但这是需要比较长的时间才能实现的。目前解决问题的主要方法，一是把全国机械工业纳入国家计划轨道，即根据国家需要，把全国机械工业合理地组织起来，以克服和防止盲目发展；二是根据国家需要，通过有计划的新产品的试制，逐步扩大产品品种，逐步提高制造技术水平。这两个工作是缺一不可的。如果只把机械工业纳入国家计划轨道，而不积极扩大产品品种和提高制造技术水平，那么我国机械工业就永远不能满足国家建设需要。同样的，如果不把全国机械工业纳入国家计划轨道和合理地组织起来，那么某些产品的重复制造，而另一些产品无人制造的现象仍会发生。本来可以集中在
  一部分工厂成批生产的产品，却分散在很多工厂零星生产，就会妨碍制造成本的降低，就会分散新产品试制的技术力量，妨碍技术水平的迅速提高，同时也就不能有效地克服生产同需要脱节的现象。这对国家来说是十分不利的。
    为了有效地把全国机械工业纳入国家计划轨道，必须贯彻“以销定产”的方针。这就是说，国家需要多的要多生产，需要少的要少生产，不需要的就不生产。不论国营、地方国营或私营机械工业，生产什么，生产多少，从那里取得原材料，向那里推销产品等，都必须按照国家计划进行。目前就必须逐步加强这种计划性。凡属于国家基本建设必需的主要设备，属于交通运输业、农业等国民经济中的重要设备，或者是要求制造技术高的设备和大批生产的产品，为了切实保证需要和便于统一规格和降低成本，必须由中央有关部门统一计划，统一组织生产，统一供应原材料，统一分配。凡属大量需要而规格简单的生活用品，则应由中央统一计划，由地方分别组织生产，统一销售。凡属规格繁多，需用量小或带有地区性的产品，则应由用户和生产单位负责平衡，以保证供应。至于那些小的、不重要的、零星生产的产品，暂时可以让工厂自产自销，但仍应由地方和有关单位作适当安排，待条件成熟后再把它们纳入国家计划轨道。我国现有的机械工厂的规模、设备能力、制造技术都不一样，有的适于制造这种产品，有的则适于制造那种产品，为了充分发挥它们的特长，应给以适当的分工。此外，私营机械工业的比重还相当大，并且又具有一定的制造技术，所以必须根据利用、限制和改造的政策，有重点、有条件、有步骤地把它们纳入国家计划的轨道。
    国家在第一个五年计划中必须建设的主要项目已经确定，工业、农业和交通运输业所需要的主要设备也已大致确定，这给机械工业按照计划生产创造了有利的条件。现在各个企业、各有关工业领导部门应同用户结合，系统地研究生产和需要的情况，进行反复的周密的计算和平衡。某些工厂干部只愿意制造大型的、利润高的、产值大又容易制造的产品，他们不顾企业的设备条件和技术水平，处处与技术比较高、设备条件比较好的企业竞争。结果是某些产品重复制造，另一些产品又没有人制造。这种状况曾经相当严重地存在着，目前虽有所改变，但仍应注意克服和防止。使用设备的部门及时地具体而又准确地提出所需要的产品规格和数量，以便生产部门及早进行生产的准备工作，是保证机械工业纳入国家计划轨道，保证产品质量的一个重要条件。目前，在订货工作中存在着的“订的迟”、“要的急”、“变的快”、“退的慢”、“要求含糊”以及盲目订货的现象，也必须加以克服。
    机械工业在提高计划性的同时，还必须在合理分工的基础上，逐步扩大产品品种，提高制造技术水平。这是每一个机械制造工厂的发展方向。几年来，机械工业曾经制造了一千多种比较重要的新产品，满足了国家建设的一定需要，也促进了机械工业制造技术的提高。但是，机械工业的新产品试制计划完成的不够好。不少重点建设工程所要的设备都没有及时收到，或者收到了但质量也不好。没有完成新产品试制计划的主要原因，一是技术力量薄弱，许多企业在扩大产品品种以后，普遍感到技术力量不足，不是产品设计图纸供应不上，就是试制的技术准备工作做得不及时；二是缺乏在一个企业里组织多品种生产的管理经验，试制工作往往不能按计划进行。因此，今后必须努力加强生产技术准备工作，同时实行同类型产品零件的标准化和规格化。根据现有的经验，有计划地做好生产前的生产技术准备工作，也可以使多种产品的生产严格按照作业计划来进行，避免生产混乱，因而加快新产品制造的速度。
    应该指出，在现代化的机器制造工厂里，必须有切实可行的先进的操作规程，有一套严格的管理制度和把全厂有机地组织起来的作业计划，才能正常地进行生产。这就需要克服过去在修配时期遗留下来的各搞一套的自由散漫习气和手工业方式，认真学习苏联的先进管理经验和技术经验，根据企业的具体情况加以应用。同时要总结和推广现有的先进经验，并要注意培养和补充产品设计力量，加强生产技术准备工作。只有这样，机械工业的计划性才能够加强，制造技术水平才能迅速提高。
