The French National Assembly began debating the London and Paris Agreements on the afternoon of the 20th. Before this debate began, the National Assembly passed a vote of confidence in the government on the issue of the Indochina budget.

At the start of the debate, the relevant committees of the National Assembly first presented reports to the Assembly on the Paris Agreements.

Pierre Billotte (Deputy of the Republican and Social Action Party), rapporteur of the Foreign Affairs Committee, called for ratification of the Paris Agreements, which would allow West Germany to rearm and join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Isoni, another rapporteur of the Foreign Affairs Committee, presented a report on the "restoration of West German sovereignty." In his report, he tried every means to conceal the threat that the Bonn Treaty, as amended by the Paris Agreements, posed to France and European peace. Von der Ropp, the third rapporteur of the Foreign Affairs Committee, presented a report on the Saar issue. He admitted that although the Foreign Affairs Committee had approved his report, the Bonn government's position on the Saar issue had caused obvious unease among everyone.

The deputies listened very attentively to the report of Badi (Radical Socialist Party), rapporteur of the National Defense Committee. This committee advocated postponing the debate on the Paris Agreements. Badi emphasized that the Paris Agreements to arm West Germany were a great danger to France. He said, "We are being asked to make a very important decision that may change the fate of France and Europe." In his opinion, this matter required careful, meticulous, and detailed study.

Badi went on to emphasize that ratification of the Paris Agreements would push France onto the path of expanding armaments and would place an excessive burden of military expenditure on France, while at that time, West German troops with modern weapons would be much stronger than French troops.

Badi also said, "The National Defense Committee recommends postponing the debate, which will prevent us from hastily passing resolutions that affect the future of France. This prevents us from easily rejecting opportunities for negotiations with the East, which may achieve the peaceful coexistence we desire."

Badi's report was greeted with applause from deputies of various parties in the parliament.

André Hugues (Radical Socialist Party) presented a report on behalf of the Economic Affairs Committee. As soon as he stepped onto the podium, Communist deputy F. Piel asked him a question: "Whom are you speaking for? Your report was passed by a vote of ten to seven among the forty-four members of the committee. Why are you hiding this?"

André Hugues said that France would demonstrate "its good will" by ratifying the Paris Agreements. He said, "Economic cooperation must be developed among Western countries." After André Hugues's speech, the chairman announced a recess.

When the meeting began on the morning of the 21st, the report was given by Leo Dye, the rapporteur of the Finance Committee, who had already refused to ratify the Paris Agreements.

Leo Dye said that accelerating the arming of West Germany would push Europe onto the path of expanding armaments, which would be an extremely serious danger. He said that the Finance Committee could not ignore the dangerous consequences for French enterprises that would arise from the so-called "European Armaments Pool." Leo Dye said that the Finance Committee opposed General Billotte's report on arming West Germany and accepting West Germany into the Atlantic bloc. He also said that as for Isoni's report on the Bonn Agreement (on the abolition of the occupation statute), the Finance Committee agreed. However, regarding the abandonment of reparations, the Finance Committee made significant reservations, because France had suffered enormous losses due to Hitler's aggression. Leo Dye also suggested postponing the discussion of the Saar issue until the dispute between France and West Germany over the Saar issue was resolved. He also said that the Saar status quo stipulated in the Franco-German agreement risked undermining France's economic strength and created greater advantages for West Germany.

Socialist deputy Lapi presented a report on behalf of the Industrial Production Committee, advocating ratification of the Paris Agreements. He tried to prove that ratification of the Paris Agreements was necessary, saying that these agreements opened a new path for European unity, helped Franco-German "reconciliation," and provided France with "necessary guarantees."

Subsequently, "Social Republican" deputy Devan presented a report on behalf of the Overseas Territories Committee, advocating ratification of the Paris Agreements. He insisted that the Paris Agreements were different from the "European Defense Community" draft and did not pose a threat to France's overseas territories or the unity of the French army.

Next, Fusinal, rapporteur of the Veterans Committee and a "Social Republican" deputy, presented a report, saying that the committee did not support the Paris Agreements because the committee was disturbed by the revival of the power of former Hitlerites.

Hu Pan, rapporteur of the Industrial Production Committee, spoke last at the meeting. He spoke specifically about the Saar issue. He also said that the so-called "European Armaments Pool" would help eliminate Franco-German competition.

The French National Assembly continued its debate on the London and Paris Agreements on the afternoon of the 21st. A total of forty people signed up to speak.

The first to take the podium was independent Republican deputy General Homérant. General Homérant very resolutely criticized the Paris Agreements. He said that the Paris Agreements were not the result of French policy, but the result of Dulles' policy.

General Homérant expressed concern about Germany's possible territorial ambitions. He asked the National Assembly not to be lured by any promises or intimidated by any threats.

The next speaker was Social Republican deputy Le Pen, who expressed unease about the Paris Agreements. He believed that this agreement had two dangers. First, it armed West Germany, and second, it proposed negotiations with "a part of a country whose borders have not yet been determined." Le Pen pointed out that the Soviet Union was France's natural ally against the threat of German militarism.

Jacques Badou, one of the oldest members of parliament, pointed out that ratification of the Paris Agreements would lead to an arms race and promote the escalation of the Cold War. Badou said: "We are unwilling to accept, under British and American pressure, a decision on the establishment of an army that has invaded French territory three times."

Social Republican deputy Jacques Soursdel expressed concern about France's fate in his speech. He said that if a "Western European alliance" were established, this alliance would only be based on the policy of American soldiers.

Soursdel said that arming Germany was of an aggressive nature, because Bonn Germany had territorial ambitions. He also said that another factor that caused unease was that Bonn interpreted the Paris Agreements as: France and other allies recognized the Bonn government as not only the legitimate government of the whole of Germany, but also the legitimate government of the territory that previously belonged to German jurisdiction. Soursdel reminded the deputies to pay attention to the fact that the note presented by the Soviet Union to the French government on December 16 was a "serious warning."

The deputies of the Democratic Social Resistance Alliance Legaré and the Social Republican deputy Noël also expressed unease in their speeches about the consequences that ratification of the Paris Agreements would entail. Noël said that the Paris Agreements had too many shortcomings to cause serious unease. Noël suggested holding negotiations with the Soviet Union to resolve the German issue.

The meeting was adjourned at this point. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 法国国民议会举行关于巴黎协定的辩论

    法国国民议会举行关于巴黎协定的辩论
    法国国民议会从二十日下午开始，举行关于伦敦和巴黎协定的辩论。在这一个辩论开始以前，国民议会就印度支那预算问题通过了信任政府的投票。
    辩论开始时，国民议会各有关委员会首先就巴黎协定向议会提出报告。
    外交委员会报告人皮埃尔·毕约特（共和与社会行动党议员）要求批准允许西德重新武装和允许西德参加北大西洋公约组织的巴黎协定。外交委员会另一报告人伊索尼就“恢复西德主权”问题提出报告。他在报告中千方百计地掩饰巴黎协定所修改的波恩条约对法国和欧洲和平所具有的威胁。外交委员会第三个报告人冯德鲁就萨尔问题提出报告。他承认：外交委员会虽然批准了他的报告，但是波恩政府在萨尔问题上的立场却引起了大家显明的不安。
    议员们很注意地听取了国防委员会报告人巴迪
  （激进社会党）的报告。这个委员会是主张延期辩论巴黎协定的。巴迪着重指出，武装西德的巴黎协定是对法国的极大危险。他说，“我们被要求采取一个非常重大的决定，这个决定可能会改变法国和欧洲的命运。”按照他的意见，这件事是需要经过慎重、仔细和详细的研究的。
    巴迪接着强调说：批准巴黎协定将把法国推上扩张军备的道路，并且将使法国负担过重的军事费用，而在那个时候，有现代化武器的西德军队却比法国军队强大得多。
    巴迪又说道，“国防委员会建议延期辩论，这可以使得我们不致于匆匆忙忙就通过影响法国未来的决议。这使得我们不致于轻易拒绝同东方谈判的机会，这种谈判是可能取得我们所希望的和平共处的。”
    巴迪的报告受到议会各党派议员的鼓掌欢迎。
    安德烈·余格（激进社会党）代表经济事务委员会在会上做了报告。他一走上讲台，共产党议员弗·皮佑就向他提了一个问题：“您代表谁来发言？您的报告在委员会四十四名委员中，以十票对七票通过的。您为什么隐瞒这点呢？”
    安德烈·余格说道，法国将以批准巴黎协定来证实“自己的良善意志”，他说，“西方国家之间必须开展经济合作”。安德烈·余格发言后，主席宣告休会。
    二十一日上午会议开始时，由已经拒绝批准巴黎协定的财政委员会报告人利奥戴做报告。
    利奥戴说：加速武装西德将把欧洲推上扩充军备的道路，这将是一个极其严重的危险。他说：财政委员会同样不能忽视从所谓“欧洲军备共储”中将产生的对法国企业的危险后果。利奥戴说，财政委员会反对毕约特将军关于武装西德和接受西德加入大西洋集团的报告。他又说：至于伊索尼关于波恩协定（关于取销占领法规）的报告，财政委员会是同意的。但是，在放弃赔款方面，财政委员会作了巨大的保留，因为法国曾经因为希特勒的侵略而遭受巨大的损失。利奥戴还建议延期讨论萨尔问题，等到法国和西德关于萨尔问题的争执得到解决后再行讨论。他又说，法德协定所规定的萨尔现状有破坏法国经济力量的危险，它给西德创造了更大的优势。
    社会党议员拉毕代表工业生产委员会报告，他主张批准巴黎协定。他力图证明批准巴黎协定是必要的，说这些协定为欧洲的团结打开一条新的道路，有助于法德的“和好”，并且对法国提供了“必要的保障”。
      随后，“社会共和党”议员狄万代表海外领地委员会作报告，主张批准巴黎协定。他硬说巴黎协定不同于“欧洲防务集团”草案，对于法国的海外属地和对于法国军队的统一并不产生威胁。
    接着，退伍军人委员会的报告人、“社会共和党”议员弗西纳尔提出报告，他说，委员会不拥护巴黎协定，因为委员会对于复活前希特勒分子的政权感到不安。
    工业生产委员会报告人许潘在会议上最后发言，他特别讲到萨尔问题。他还说，所谓“欧洲军备共储”将有助消除法德的竞争。
    法国国民议会在二十一日下午继续举行关于伦敦和巴黎协定的辩论。报名发言的共四十人。
    第一个走上讲坛的是独立共和党议员奥麦朗将军。奥麦朗将军十分坚决地指责巴黎协定。他说：巴黎协定不是法国政策造成的结果，而是杜勒斯政策造成的结果。
    奥麦朗将军对德国可能有的领土野心表示担心。他要求国民议会不要受任何诺言所引诱，不要为任何威胁所吓倒。
    接着发言的是社会共和党议员勒庞，他对巴黎协定表示不安。他认为，这项协定有两个危险。第
  一，它武装西德，第二，它建议同“一个还没有确定疆界的国家的一部分”谈判。勒庞指出，苏联是法国对抗德国军国主义威胁的天然同盟者。
    最老的议会议员之一雅克·巴杜指出，批准巴黎协定会造成扩军，促使冷战加剧。巴杜说：“我们不愿意在英美压力下接受关于建立曾经三度侵犯法国领土的军队的决定。”
    社会共和党议员雅克·苏斯戴尔在发言中表示担心法国的命运。他说，如果建立起“西欧联盟”的话，这一联盟所依据的也只是美国军人的政策。
    苏斯戴尔说：武装德国是带着侵略性质的，因为波恩德国有着领土野心。他还说：引起不安的另外一个因素是，波恩把巴黎协定解释成：法国和其他盟国承认波恩政府不仅是整个德国的合法政府，而且是以前曾经属于德国管辖的领土的合法政府。苏斯戴尔提醒议员们注意说：苏联十二月十六日向法国政府提出的照会是一个“严重的警告”。
    在发言时对批准巴黎协定将招致的后果表示不安的还有民主社会抵抗联盟议员勒加雷和社会共和党议员诺埃尔。诺埃尔说，巴黎协定的缺点太多了，以致使人感到严重的不安。诺埃尔建议同苏联举行解决德国问题的谈判。
    会议至此休会。（新华社）
