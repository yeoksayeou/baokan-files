Jiangxi Province farmers in oil-producing areas have sold more than 25 million catties of edible oil (including the equivalent amount of oil tea seeds, sesame, peanuts and other oil crops) to the state since October this year. Nanchang, Shanggao, Fenyi, Yifeng, Tonggu, Guangfeng, Dexing, Hukou and other counties have completed or exceeded their winter oil and oil crop procurement plans for this year. Among them, Yifeng County overfulfilled its plan by more than double.

The autumn harvest of oil crops in Jiangxi Province this year was best for oil tea seeds. The oil yield of oil tea seeds this year is also much higher than in previous years. Some farmers in Yichun County can extract 1,000 to 2,000 catties of oil from the oil tea seeds they harvested. (Xinhua News Agency)

    江西省农民踊跃卖油给国家
    江西省各油料产区的农民今年十月以来，已卖给国家两千五百多万斤食油（包括部分油茶籽、芝麻、花生等油料的折合数）。南昌、上高、分宜、宜丰、铜鼓、广丰、德兴、湖口等县已经完成或超额完成了今年冬季油和油料的收购计划。其中宜丰县超额完成了一倍以上。
    江西省今年秋季收获的油料作物，以油茶籽的收成最好。今年油茶籽的出油率也比往年提高很多。宜春县有的农户所收获的油茶籽可榨出一千斤到二千斤油。　（新华社）
