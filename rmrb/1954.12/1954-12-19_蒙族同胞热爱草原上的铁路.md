To the Editor:

On the line from Jining to Erenhot, which is over three hundred kilometers long, thousands upon thousands of workers are battling against wind, snow, cold, desert, and frozen earth. Ask anyone, and they will surely tell you many touching stories about our Mongol compatriots.

　　When we first arrived here, it was just a vast grassland with not even a road. The cars just kept driving according to the compass, and slowly, for the first time, they pressed a road out of the grass. Once there was a route, we could set up shop and get to work; but people need water to work. Ah, water! Water on the grassland is truly more precious than pearls. In the boundless and immense grassland, we just couldn't find even a small well.

　　We spent so much equipment and manpower trying to dig wells, and often dug ten empty wells in a row, which really tormented us! Darbo Liyin, a Mongolian man in his sixties, rode his horse from his yurt a long, long way to the construction site to visit his "relatives." He said, "Building a railway on the grassland is the happiness that Chairman Mao has brought us. How can I stand by and do nothing when my comrades are in trouble?" With his sixty years of experience, he pointed out where wells could be dug, and digging there was called "unerring." From then on, the workers not only had no problem with food and drink, but they could also use the rice water saved from cooking to wash their faces and feet before going to bed at night, washing away the day's fatigue. People can name a whole string of names similar to Darbo Liyin.

　　A new driver came to the motorcade, young and strong, and his skills were also good. In order to complete an urgent task, he drove his car alone from the rear to Erenhot at night. Late at night, the wind howled even more fiercely, and the grassland seemed particularly cold. He was about to cross a large desert in front of him. The car drove on the desert as if an ant had fallen into a pot. The driver turned the steering wheel, trying to make a turn to bypass this annoying desert. Suddenly, he found that the water in the tank was running low. The driver braked, opened the car door, and casually picked up a water bucket to find water. A gust of wind rolled up the sand, and the driver's back disappeared immediately in the wind...

　　Three days later, people on the railway found the car on the grassland, and also found the small water bucket from the car. But what about the person? The workers shed tears in secret for this young man -- the grassland is originally a place where wolves haunt!

　　Unexpectedly, good news came on the fifth day: the young driver was sent to the government office by the local Mongol compatriots on horseback.

　　The deeds of the Mongol people loving the road-building workers are endless. When the road was being built to Wundermiao, Lama Dao Budeng gave up his house for the workers to live in. All the Mongolian herders of the Sixth Clan in Xinmin District, led by the clan chief Doogar, rode their horses to offer flags to the road-building workers. Namujila, who was over sixty years old, came to the twelfth work area to ask to "do his part." He said, "I have cattle and camels, and I can help the railway transport things." Many herders gave valuable wild yellow sheep, butter, and milk tofu to the workers, and said to them, "What difficulties do you have? Just say it, we are family!"

　　If you ask why the Mongol people love the railway and the road-building workers so much, let's listen to what Namujila's wife said:

　　"During the rule of the reactionaries, when Mongolians took some wool to exchange for a few feet of cloth, it was often robbed by bandits on the way. We didn't have cloth, so we had to wear old sheepskins without cloth in winter, and turned the sheepskin coats over to wear in summer. After liberation, the people's government transported a large number of cheap and good-quality cloth, tea, and daily necessities to us. Think about it, if trains pass through the grassland, won't the supply of materials for our daily life be even more guaranteed?"

　　The young people's ideas are even more beautiful. They said, "We Mongolians love horses the most, because when we ride on horseback and whip it, the distant grassland is instantly at our side; now we love the railway even more, because after the railway is built, today we can put on our festive costumes, jump on a comfortable passenger car, and the next day we can reach our capital – Beijing."

　　The railway line from Jining to Erenhot, this new international transportation trunk line, shortens the journey from Moscow to Beijing and promotes the connection between the interior and the border areas. This railway line is built on the vast grassland of the motherland, and also built in the hearts of the Mongol compatriots.

### 蒙族同胞热爱草原上的铁路

    蒙族同胞热爱草原上的铁路编辑同志：
    从集宁到二连三百几十公里的线路上，有成千成万的工人和风雪、寒冷、沙漠、冻土展开搏斗。随便你问哪一个，人们准会滔滔不绝地告诉你许多蒙族同胞的感人的故事。
    刚到这儿来，茫茫一片大草原，连条道都没有。汽车按着指北针一个劲地开，慢慢才从草地上第一次压出一条汽车路。有了路线就可以摆下摊子把活儿干起来；人要干活就离不开水。水啊！水在草原上可真是比珍珠还要贵重。无边无际偌大的草原，可就是找不到小小的一口井。
    为了挖井，不知耗费了多少器材人工，常常是十挖十空，真把人折腾得够受啊！六十多岁的蒙民达博利音骑着马离开了蒙古包，老远老远地到工地来探望“亲人”。他说：“在草原上修铁路，是毛主席带给我们的幸福，哪能见同志们有困难撒手不管？”凭着他六十多年的经验，他指点哪儿可以打井、挖下去就叫做“百发百中”。从此，工人们不但吃喝不成问题，晚上临睡时还可以用烧饭时保存下来的淘米水，擦擦脸，洗洗脚，洗掉一天的疲劳。类似达博利音这样的人，人们还可以念出一连串的名字。
    汽车队新来一个司机，年轻力壮，技术也可以。他为了完成一个紧急的任务，晚上，一个人驾着汽车从后方到二连去。深夜，风呼啸得更凶，草原显得格外寒冷。前面就要横过一片大沙漠，汽车开在沙漠上，就像蚂蚁掉进锅。司机扭转方向盘，企图拐个弯绕过这段讨厌的沙漠。忽然发现水箱里的水快干了，司机煞下车来，推开车门，随手提了只水桶去找水。一阵狂风卷起了漫天的黄沙，司机的背影也立即消失在这阵风沙里……。
    三天以后，铁路上的人在草地上找到了这辆汽车，也找到那只汽车上用的小水桶。可是人呢？工人们暗地里为这个年青人流着泪——草原上本来就是狼群出没的地方啊！
    想不到第五天就传来了喜讯：年轻的司机被当地的蒙族同胞用马送到政府机关里。
    蒙族人民热爱修路员工的事迹是说不尽的。路修到温都尔庙时，喇嘛刀不登把房子让出来给工人们住，新民区第六族全体蒙族牧民在族长都嘎尔率领下骑着马来向筑路工人献旗；六十多岁的那木吉拉到十二工区来要求“尽点义务”。他说：“我有牛有骆驼，可以帮助铁路上运点东西。”许多牧民把珍贵的野黄羊、黄油和奶豆腐送给工人，对工人说：“有什么困难？尽管说吧，是一家人！”
    若问蒙族人民为什么这样热爱铁路和筑路员工，让我们听听那木吉拉妻子的话吧：
    “在反动派统治时，蒙民拿点羊毛去换几尺布，常常在半路上被土匪抢走。我们没有布，冬天只得穿着没布面的老羊皮，夏天又把羊皮袄翻过来穿。解放后，人民政府给我们运来大批价廉物美的布、茶和日用品。你想，草原上通了火车，我们日常生活的物资供应不是更有了保证吗？”
    年青人的想法就更美丽了。他们说：“我们蒙民最喜爱的是马，因为跨上马，一扬鞭，那茫茫的草原的远方，一转眼就到了我们身边；现在我们就更喜爱铁路了，因为铁路修通后，今天我们换上了节日盛装，跳上舒适的客车，第二天就可以到达我们的首都—北京。”
    集宁到二连的铁路线，这条国际运输的新干线，它缩短了莫斯科到北京的行程，它促进了内地和边疆的联系。这条铁路线，是修筑在祖国辽阔的草原上，也修筑在蒙族同胞的心上。
