Learned Abundant Advanced Technology from the Soviet Exhibition
    Apply Soviet Experience to Production
    Henan workers and farmers who visited the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievement Exhibition are applying what they learned from the visit to their practical work. Yan Tianen, a planer in the state-owned Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory, after returning to the factory, first studied and promoted S. Latreykin's "high-powered cutting planer tool" in the planer workshop. The work efficiency is six times higher than that of ordinary planer tools, and more than doubled compared to Yu Linijilov's "wonderful planer tool" that had already been promoted in their factory. Sheng Wan, a female spinner in the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, tested the "fine yarn replaced with coarse yarn twisting method" she learned from the exhibition in her group. The result proved that this method can prevent yarn breakage and improve product quality. The factory leadership is preparing to summarize and promote her trial work. Farmers who visited the exhibition hall have improved their socialist awareness and strengthened their determination to support national industrialization. Liu Fuyu, director of the Judong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linying County, after visiting various agricultural machinery at the exhibition, reversed his previous wrong idea that "industrialization is not an immediate concern for farmers." He led the masses to sell surplus grain to the state, expanded the agricultural production cooperative from fifteen households to more than fifty households, and actively carried out winter production campaigns. Yang Peichun, a provincial agricultural labor model in the Zhengzhou suburban area, gave a report to more than 200 district and township cadres after returning from the visit. He also braved wind and snow to travel to various villages, mobilizing and organizing the masses to expand and merge cooperatives, and bought back a double-furrow plow. Now, the rationalization proposal campaign in Yang Peichun's agricultural production cooperative has been launched, and a plan to transform a large area of puddles is being actively formulated.

    Improve Technology, Leverage Machine Potential
    Xing Zhilu, a labor model in the Jinan No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, used to think that it was impossible to manufacture highly mechanized and automated lathes and that there was no way to avoid producing defective products. After seeing the Soviet exhibition, he realized that these ideas were all wrong. After returning to the factory, he made many suggestions to the leadership on improving technology. Such as adding a cap to the broaching tool on the broaching machine to control the size of the cut, replacing the method of knocking the tool bundle with a hammer; changing the lead cover of the 1616 type lathe to iron, and configuring a quick tool retraction device on the lathe; installing a chip breaker on the bed tool to leverage the potential of the turret lathe. Some of these suggestions have been adopted by the leadership, and some are being studied. Huang Ruiting, a technician at the Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, visited the Soviet exhibition and was deeply moved by the examples of the Soviet Communist Party and government protecting the safety of the working people and reducing the labor intensity of workers in every possible way. He intends to suggest to the administration: to set up a comprehensive gear inspection instrument; to use an interference microscope to inspect the surface finish; and to equip the coordinate boring machine with an eccentric chuck to ensure product quality. Gu Guilan, a labor model from Shandong State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1, was surrounded by sisters in the workshop every day after returning from the visit, asking her to talk about her gains from the visit. Based on her suggestion, the factory is experimenting with the Soviet double-handed splicing method, which can make the splice without knots and improve the quality of the yarn.

    Convert Hand-Pushed Double-Row Vehicles into Automatic Double-Row Vehicles
    Huang Rongchang, a representative of the National People's Congress and a worker in the carpentry workshop of Chongqing 101 Factory, after visiting the Soviet exhibition and returning to the workshop, converted the original hand-pushed double-row vehicle in the carpentry workshop into an automatic double-row vehicle according to the style of the automatic double-row vehicle at the exhibition, increasing efficiency by one time; originally, it required eight people to operate; now only two people are needed to operate. He also transformed the original single-sided planing machine into a four-sided planing machine, which solved a key problem in production. In order to help the quarry achieve mechanization, the workers in the carpentry workshop have helped the quarry install a stone crusher and a water pump, and are now actively repairing a scrapped internal combustion engine to solve the power problem of the quarry in order to extract more dolomite for steel smelting and support the liberation of Taiwan.

    Give Play to Enthusiasm, Produce No Rework
    Yan Renhai, a representative of the National People's Congress, a Hunan provincial industrial labor model, and the head of the welding class at Xiangtan Electric Motor Factory, gave a report to all the factory's employees after visiting the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievement Exhibition. He said to the workers: Our lathes can only rotate 1,200 times per minute, while the latest Soviet-produced lathes rotate more than 5,000 times per minute; the faster the lathe turns, the faster socialism will come. His reports and talks greatly encouraged all the factory's employees, especially the workers in the welding class, and the quality of welding products continued to improve. Liu Hui, a worker who used to have the most rework, also welded things very carefully. The entire class did not produce a single piece of rework in November. The entire class completed the annual production task one month ahead of schedule this year. The welding task for January next year's switch products was completed before December 20. In the trial production of China's first electric arc furnace, all the workers in the welding class demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. They test-welded a 20 cm thick steel plate furnace shell, and the welding wire passed the tensile test, proving that it fully met Soviet standards, ensuring the smooth progress of the electric arc furnace trial production. Li Chenggui, a provincial agricultural labor model, was very moved after returning from the visit. The mutual aid group he belonged to has recently been transformed into an agricultural production cooperative. In order to see those "iron oxen" in the Soviet exhibition hall driving into the fields as soon as possible, they have sold all of their more than 6,000 catties of surplus grain to the state to support the country's industrial construction.

    Modify Combine Harvesters to Improve Harvesting Efficiency
    Li Dejiang, a female combine harvester driver at the Tongbei State-owned Mechanical Farm in Heilongjiang Province, excitedly talked about her gains after visiting the Soviet exhibition in Beijing: As soon as I walked into the square where agricultural machinery was placed, I repeatedly looked at that "ES-4 combine harvester," because this combine harvester is the same brand as the one I drove, but the device that transports the cut wheat into the machine body has been changed. The combine harvester I used before used a conveyor belt to send the wheat into the machine body. This conveyor belt is not easy to adjust, either loose or tight, which often causes malfunctions. This time, when I looked at the combine harvester at the exhibition, it did not use a conveyor belt, but had a "chain harrow" installed on the outside. I looked at it for a long time and couldn't understand it. The explainer also didn't explain it specifically enough. I was getting anxious when a Soviet comrade came and explained the function of the "chain harrow" and its internal device on the spot. After the explanation, he started the combine harvester. This time, I completely understood. I am extremely grateful for the Soviet comrade's enthusiastic help. After returning to the farm, we immediately started researching and modified the original combine harvester to be equipped with a "chain harrow." We believe that this will definitely improve the harvesting efficiency of our combine harvester. (Our Heilongjiang Province Reporter Station)
    Improve Cultivation Techniques to Strive for Increased Grain and Cotton Production
    Zhang Weiyuan, director of the Xincun Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wen'an County, Hebei Province, visited the Soviet exhibition in mid-November. He saw many new types of agricultural machinery. A Stalin No. 6 combine harvester, driven by five people, can replace more than 130 laborers and can harvest and thresh 33 mu of crops per hour. He also saw the No. 2 and No. 3 cotton of the Soviet Uzbekistan Collective Farm, which can produce 1,500 jin per mu. This broke his conservative thinking. He thought: "In the past, our village produced a maximum of 80 jin of cotton per mu. Last year, the cooperative promoted the Soviet close planting experience, and the average cotton production per mu was 150 jin. I thought there was no way to increase production anymore. Now I realize that as long as we work hard to improve cultivation techniques and increase fertilizer application, we can still increase production." Therefore, they are preparing to accumulate 300 carts of fertilizer this winter, strengthen the management of winter wheat, and hoe the more than 200 mu of wheat planted by selecting seeds, striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year.
    Determined to Run Agricultural Production Cooperatives Well
    More than 700 people in Jilin Province have visited the Soviet exhibition. After returning, they generally conducted publicity and introductions. For example, in Liaoyuan City, where the newly built central shaft of the Xi'an Coal Mine is located, 17 report meetings were organized, with a total of more than 6,000 people participating. In rural areas, the farmers who visited the exhibition were surrounded by male and female farmers until the visitors finished talking about everything they remembered, and the farmers still felt it was not enough. Kang Fengbo, an ordinary worker who is building the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant in the severe cold, said in an article written for the Jilin Daily: "After seeing the exhibition, I have a clearer direction for advancement. We must work hard to build our factory so that our country can quickly reach a highly culturally advanced industrial country like the Soviet Union." Li Yongzuo (Korean ethnicity), chairman of the Yinma River Collective Farm in Jiutai County, had more than 140 members listen to his introduction after returning from Beijing. During the discussion, the members and production team leaders all expressed their feelings. Farmer Song Qigui decided to run the agricultural production cooperative well after returning from the visit and planned to build a completely socialist agricultural production cooperative in a few years.

    Check Shortcomings, Set Out Improvement Methods
    The workers and farmers in the Shaanxi Provincial Delegation who visited the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievement Exhibition excitedly communicated in detail everything they saw after returning. Ma Tinghai, director of the Huangpu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, said: "Using cotton pickers to pick cotton is more skillful than women picking by hand. A cotton picker can replace 25 laborers. When it picks cotton, it will not damage the cotton branches or knock off the cotton bolls that have not yet matured." He continued, "To be like the Soviet Union, we must work hard to produce and connect all the land in Huangpu Village so that we can use machines in the future." Cao Zhuxiang, director of the Weinan Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative, firmly stated that she would expand the 16-household agricultural production cooperative. After the workers of the Dahua Textile Factory listened to Feng Yansheng's account of his visit to the exhibition, they discussed in groups in light of the factory's production situation, checked the reasons for the increase in yarn breakage and roller flowers in the first half of December, and set out improvement methods for the future. In the second half of December, the production situation has improved. (Our Shaanxi Reporter Station)
    Thank the Soviet Union, Learn from the Soviet Union!
    Many factory employees in Shenyang City gained important inspiration from visiting the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievement Exhibition. Wang Wenshan, a municipal labor model and director of the 1D62 workshop at the First Machine Tool Factory, is busy preparing for the 1955 production. When he thinks that the world-class 1D62 lathe will soon be produced in large quantities from his workshop, the words thank the Soviet Union and learn from the Soviet Union immediately flood his mind. He often takes out the picture of the combined machine tool and the pipe joint hidden in his desk drawer and examines them carefully, and then puts them away like a treasure. He said: I asked the Soviet comrades for this when I visited the Soviet exhibition. The Soviet comrades hope that we can quickly master that high-efficiency 1D62 machine tool. Chen Guangzeng, deputy engineer of the Shenyang Paper Mill, saw that the roofing paper displayed in the industrial hall had no core and immediately thought that the oil felt base paper produced by his factory now has wooden cores. He stood in front of that roll of coreless roofing paper and pondered for a while. He thought that this could save a lot of wood! After returning to the factory, he actively researched using springs or other automatic tightening cores to replace the current copper coin-like wooden cores. Guo Guilan, a female worker at the Woolen Mill, after returning to the factory, often thought of the automatic loom that she watched twice at the exhibition. She said: The machine frame is not big, but it can produce so much work in a day, it is so enviable! Guo Guilan deeply feels that to master the advanced technology of the Soviet Union, one must first have culture. She said: I didn't know a single character in the past. Although I opened the door to culture after liberation, it is still not very bright. Everything I saw at the Soviet exhibition this time is telling me to study hard, learn culture, learn technology, and learn from the Soviet Union.

    从苏联展览会学到了丰富的先进技术
    把苏联经验运用到生产中去
    参观过苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的河南工人、农民们，正在把在参观中学到的东西运用到实际工作中去。国营郑州纺织机械厂刨工阎天恩回厂后，首先在刨工车间里研究推广斯·拉特雷金的
  “强力切削刨刀”，工效比一般刨刀提高六倍，比他们厂里早就推行着的尤力尼吉罗夫的“奇妙刨刀”的工效也提高了一倍多。国营郑州第二棉纺织厂细纱女工盛婉，在她的小组里试行她从展览会里学得的“细纱换粗纱包捻法”的结果，证明这个工作法可以防止断头、提高产品质量。该厂领导上准备将她的试行工作进行总结和推广。参观了展览馆的农民们都提高了社会主义觉悟，加强了支援国家工业化的决心。临颍县巨东农业生产合作社社长刘富裕参观了展览会各种农业机械后，扭转了自己过去认为“工业化不是农民的切身急事”的错误思想，他带动群众把余粮卖给国家，把农业生产合作社由十五户扩大到五十多户，积极开展冬季生产运动。郑州市郊区省农业劳动模范杨培春参观回来，向全区二百多名区乡干部做了报告。他还冒着风雪奔走各村，动员和组织群众进行扩社和并社，并买回了双铧犁。现在，杨培春所在的农业生产合作社的合理化建议运动已经展开，一个改造大片水洼地的计划正在积极制订中。（本报河南记者站）
    改进技术，发挥机器潜力
    济南第一机床厂劳动模范邢治陆过去一直认为制造车床高度机械化、自动化是不可能的，没有办法不出废品。看了苏联展览会后，知道这些想法都错了。他回厂后向领导上提出了许多改进技术的建议。如给膛床上的膛刀加帽，控制吃刀的尺寸，以代替用榔头敲刀束的办法；将一六一六型车床的铅质盖改成铁的，在车床上配置快速退刀器；在床刀上安断屑器，发挥转塔车床的潜力。这些建议有的领导上已经采纳了，有的正在研究中。济南第二机床厂技术员黄瑞亭，参观了苏联展览会，对苏联共产党和政府处处保护劳动人民的安全，减轻工人的劳动强度的事例深受感动。他打算向行政上建议：设置齿轮综合检查仪；用干涉显微镜来检验光洁度；在座标搪床上配置偏心夹头，以保证产品质量。山东国棉一厂的劳动模范谷桂兰参观回来后，天天被车间的姊妹们包围着，要她讲参观的收获。根据她的建议，厂里正在试验苏联的双手接头法，它可使接头没疙瘩，并能提高纱的质量。

    把手推双行车改为自动双行车
    全国人民代表大会代表、重庆一零一厂木工车间工人黄荣昌，参观苏联展览会回车间以后，按照展览会上的自动双行车式样，将木工房原有的手推双行车改为自动双行车，效率提高了一倍；原来要八个人操作；现在两个人就可以操作了。他并将原有一方刨木机改装为四方刨木机，解决了生产中的关键问题。为帮助采石场实行机械化，木工车间的工人已帮助采石工地安装了碎石机、抽水机，现在正积极修理一部废内燃机，解决采石场的动力问题，以开采更多的白云石冶炼钢铁，支援解放台湾。（本报四川记者站）
    发挥积极性，不出返工活
    全国人民代表大会代表、湖南省工业劳动模范、湘潭电机厂电焊班班长言仁海参观苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会以后，回到工厂向全厂职工作了报告。他对工人们说：我们的车床每分钟只能转一千二百次，苏联最近出产的车床每分钟要转五千多次；车床转得快，社会主义也就会来得更快。他的报告和谈话，给全厂职工特别是电焊班的工人很大鼓舞，电焊产品质量不断提高，过去返工最多的工人刘辉，焊东西也特别仔细，全班在十一月份内没有出过一件返工活。今年全班提前一个月完成了全年生产任务。在十二月二十日前已完成明年一月份开关产品的电焊任务。湘潭电机厂在试制我国第一台电弧炼钢炉中，电焊班全体工人发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，他们试焊二十糎厚钢板炉壳，焊线经过拉力试验，证明完全符合苏联标准，保证了电弧炼钢炉试制工作的顺利进行。省农业劳动模范李呈桂，参观回来以后非常感动。他所在的互助组最近已转为农业生产合作社。为了早日看到像苏联展览馆中的那些“铁牛”开到田地里来，他们已把六千多斤余粮全部卖给了国家，支援国家的工业建设。（本报湖南记者站）
    改装联合收割机，提高收割效率
    黑龙江省通北国营机械农场女联合收割机驾驶员李德江，到北京参观苏联展览会后，兴奋地谈她参观后的收获：我一走到放农业机器的广场，就反复看那台“爱斯四联合收割机”，因为这台联合收割机和我开动过的那台是一种牌号，但是这一台把割掉的小麦运到机体内的装置改变了。我以前用的那台联合收割机，是用输送布把小麦送入机体，这个输送布不容易调整，不是松就是紧，往往因此发生故障。这次一看展览会的那台联合收割机，不是用输送布，而是外边安着一个“链耙”。我看了半天看不懂，说明员也解答得不够具体，我正着急，一位苏联同志来了，当场就讲解“链耙”的作用和它里面的装置，讲完后，他又把联合收割机开动起来。这一来，我完全明白了。我对苏联同志这样热心的帮助万分感激。回场之后，我们马上就动手研究，把原来的联合收割机改装成带“链耙”的了，我们相信，这样一定会提高我们联合收割机的收割效率。（本报黑龙江省记者站）
    改进耕作技术争取增产粮棉
    河北省文安县新村前进农业生产合作社社长张维元，在十一月中旬参观了苏联展览会，他看到了许许多多新型的农业机器。一部斯大林六号联合收割机，用五个人驾驶，就能顶一百三十多个劳动力，连收带打每小时可收三十三亩庄稼。他又看到了苏联乌兹别克斯集体农庄的二号和三号棉花，每亩能产一千五百斤，这打破了他的保守思想。他想：“俺村过去每亩产棉最高收八十斤，去年社里推行了苏联密植经验，平均每亩棉花产了一百五十斤，我就认为没法再增产啦，现在我认识到，只要努力改进耕作技术，增施肥料，还是可以增产的。”因此，他们在今冬准备积肥三百车，加强冬小麦的管理，把二百多亩挑耩小麦普遍镐一遍，争取明年小麦丰收。
    决心办好农业生产合作社
    吉林省先后有七百多人参观了苏联展览会。他们回去以后普遍进行了传达介绍。如西安煤矿新建的中央竖井所在地的辽源市，组织了十七次报告会，共有六千多人参加。在农村，参观过展览会的农民被男女农民们围着，直到参观人把记住的都讲完了，农民还嫌不够。正在严寒中建设第一汽车制造厂的一个普通工人康凤波，他在给吉林日报写的一篇文章中说：“我看过了展览会以后，更明确了前进的方向，我们一定要努力建设我们的工厂，使我国很快达到像苏联那样具有高度文化的工业国家。”九台县饮马河集体农庄主席李永祚（朝鲜族）从北京参观回来后，有一百四十多名庄员听了他的介绍。在座谈时，庄员和生产队长都发表了自己的感想。农民宋祁贵参观回来后，决心要把农业生产合作社办好，并盘算在几年之后建成完全社会主义的农业生产合作社。

    检查缺点，订出改进办法
    参观苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的陕西省代表团中的工人、农民回去以后，兴奋地把所看到的一切作了详细的传达。大荔县黄甫村农业生产合作社的主任马廷海说：“用采棉机来摘棉花比妇女们用手摘起来还巧妙，一部采棉机可以代替二十五个劳力，它采棉时，不会损坏棉花枝干，也不会碰下还没有成熟的棉桃。”他接着说：“咱们要和苏联那样，就要努力生产，把黄甫村的土地整个连起来，将来才能使用机器。”渭南红星农业生产合作社主任曹竹香坚决表示要将十六户的农业生产合作社扩大。大华纺织厂职工听了冯彦生传达参观展览会的经过后，结合本厂的生产情况分组进行讨论，检查了十二月上半月断头、皮辊花增多的原因，订出了今后改进的办法。十二月下旬，生产情况已经有了好转。（本报陕西记者站）
    感谢苏联，学习苏联！
    沈阳市许多工厂职工从参观苏联经济及文化建设展览会中得到了重要启示。市劳动模范第一机床厂一Д六二车间主任王文山，正在忙着做一九五五年的生产准备工作，他一想那世界上第一流的一Д六二车床不久就要从自己的车间大量生产出来时，感谢苏联、学习苏联这几个字就立刻涌现在脑子里。他常常把藏在办公桌抽屉里的那份联合机床图片和管子接头拿出来仔细端相，然后又把它像宝贝似地收起来。他说：这是我参观苏联展览会时向苏联同志要的，苏联同志盼咱们能赶快掌握那高效能的一Д六二机床呢。沈阳造纸厂副工程师陈光增看到工业馆陈列的屋顶纸没有芯子，马上想到自己工厂现在生产的油毡原纸个个都有木芯子，他就站在那卷没有芯子的屋顶纸跟前沉思了一会儿，他想这样能省下大批木材啊！他回厂后就积极研究用弹簧或其它自动松紧的芯子，来代替现在的铜钱似的木芯子。毛织厂女工郭桂兰回厂后，不时地想起在展览会里看了两遍的那台自动织布机。她说：机台架子不大，一天能出那么多活，该多让人羡慕啊！郭桂兰深深感到要掌握苏联的先进技术，必须先有文化才行。她说：我过去一个字不识，解放后我虽然打开了文化的大门，可是还不是特别的亮。这回参观苏联展览会所看到的一切都在告诉我要努力学习，学习文化，学习技术，学习苏联。
