    Temporarily Closed for Technical Exchange Activities

    To meet the learning needs of all sectors of our country, the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition, as decided by the Chinese and Soviet governments, will be extended to be closed on the 26th.

    In order to solve the problems in technical exchange in a focused and thorough manner, the scope of experience exchange is divided into four parts: industry, agriculture, culture, and water conservancy. The industrial part includes 52 items such as metal cutting lathes, textile machinery, electrical equipment, electronic computers, optical instruments, meteorological stations and meteorological instruments, transportation equipment, and subway equipment. The agricultural part includes seven items such as the main indicators of agricultural development, machine tractor stations, Soviet grain, and animal husbandry. The cultural part includes nine items such as industrial and civil housing construction, mechanization of Soviet industrial and civil construction, and teaching courses in construction majors at Soviet universities. The water conservancy part includes six items such as new achievements in Soviet water conservancy construction and the principle of installing power stations. In addition, there will be special reports on industry, agriculture, cotton planting, plastic arts, film equipment, radio equipment, handicrafts, musical instruments, and more. Soviet experts will do their utmost to answer the questions raised by various units within these scopes. The Soviet Exhibition Hall's experience exchange reception room has specially invited relevant units such as the Ministry of Higher Education and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to study how to organize learning. Over the past two months, the exhibition hall installation team has conducted a series of studies under the personal guidance of Soviet experts.

    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会为满足我国各界学习的要求，经中苏两国政府决定，延期到二十六日闭幕。并决定从明天（十六日）起，暂停一般参观，专门组织北京市和各地工厂、企业、学校和专业部门进行技术交流活动。
    为了集中而彻底地解决技术交流中的问题，交流经验的范围，共分工业、农业、文化、水力四部分。工业部分包括金属切削车床、纺织机器、电气设备、电动计算机、光学仪器、气象站和气象仪器、运输设备和地下铁道设备等五十二个项目。农业部分包括农业发展的主要标志、机器拖拉机站、苏联的谷物、牧畜业等七个项目。文化部分包括工业和公民住宅建设、苏联工业及民用建设的机械化、苏联高等学校施工专业的教学课程等九个项目。水力部分包括苏联水力建设的新成就、安装发电站的原理等六个项目。此外，还有关于工业、农业、植棉业、造型艺术、电影设备、无线电设备、手工艺品、乐器等的专题报告。各单位在这些范围内提出的问题，苏联专家将尽一切可能答复。苏联展览馆经验交流接待室为此特邀请高等教育部、中华全国总工会北京市委员会等有关单位，研究如何组织学习问题。两个多月来，展览馆安装队在苏联专家亲自指导下，进行了一系列的学习。这次他们将大力协助技术交流工作。
