Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: The so-called "Mutual Security Treaty" between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique was signed in Washington on December 2nd.

The full text of the ten articles of this treaty, which has already been published, completely exposes it as a tool for the United States to attempt to permanently occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands as military bases for plotting aggression against China and Asia.

This treaty is a bill of absolute sale for Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, on which the US government directed the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to put its seal. The treaty stipulates that it is "valid indefinitely," and the United States can station troops at any location currently held by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, permanently occupying Chinese territory of Taiwan and other islands. The treaty states that "the Government of the Republic of China grants the Government of the United States of America the right to deploy...United States land, sea, and air forces in and about Taiwan and the Pescadores [Penghu Islands]."

This treaty is one in which the US government, heedless of the consequences, obstructs the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. The treaty stipulates that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique "will separately and jointly, by means of self-help and mutual aid, maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack."

This is yet another treaty that the United States can use to expand the war at any time. The treaty states that after the "Contracting Parties" take joint action, the United Nations Security Council will be asked to "take measures." The treaty thus lays the groundwork for a conspiracy to repeat the Korean War, so that the US aggressive bloc can one day expand the war launched by the US and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

It is obvious that the signing of the so-called "Mutual Security Treaty" between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique seriously infringes upon China's sovereignty, greatly worsens the situation in the Far East, and seriously threatens peace and security in the region. Moreover, it stipulates that the United States should support the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in strengthening its tyrannical rule to suppress all resistance from the people of Taiwan. The treaty states that as long as "an armed attack in the West Pacific area on the territory of either of the Contracting Parties" can be considered "endangering its own peace and security," the "Contracting Parties" can take action to deal with the so-called "common danger."

This is a treaty in which the United States further supports and uses the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to launch military provocations and armed aggression against the People's Republic of China. The treaty stipulates that aggressive actions taken under this treaty can be applied to territories other than Taiwan and the Penghu Islands as determined by mutual agreement, which paves the way for the United States to further use the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to create trouble and provoke a major war.

### 美国和蒋贼签订所谓“共同安全条约”严重侵犯我国主权并威胁着远东和平

    美国和蒋贼签订所谓“共同安全条约”
    严重侵犯我国主权并威胁着远东和平
    【新华社三日讯】　美国和蒋介石卖国集团间的所谓“共同安全条约”已经在十二月二日在华盛顿签字。
    已经公布了的这个条约的十条全文完全暴露了它是美国企图永久占领台湾和澎湖列岛作为军事基地以策划对中国和亚洲的侵略的一个工具。
    这个条约是美国政府指使蒋介石卖国集团画了押的一张台湾和澎湖列岛的绝卖契。条约规定它本身是“无限期有效的”，美国可以在现在蒋介石卖国集团手中的任何地点驻扎军队，永久侵占中国领土台湾和其他岛屿。条约说“中华民国政府让与美利坚合众国政府接受在台湾和澎湖列岛及其附近部署……美国陆、海、空部队的权利”。
    这个条约是美国政府甘冒不韪阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾和澎湖列岛的条约。条约规定，美国和蒋介石卖国集团“将分别地和联合地以自助和互助的办法，维持和发展他们个别的和集体的能力以抵抗武装进攻”。
    这又是一个美国可以藉以随时扩大战争的条约。条约说，“缔约国”采取共同行动后，还要联合国安全理事会来“采取措施”。这个条约就这样埋伏了重演侵朝战争那样的阴谋，以便美国侵略集团有朝一日把美国和蒋介石卖国集团发动的战争扩大。
    显而易见，美国和蒋介石卖国集团的所谓“共同安全条约”的签订，严重地侵犯中国的主权，大大地恶化了远东的局势，严重地威胁着这一地区的和平与安全。而且它还规定美国要支持蒋介石卖国集团加强其暴虐的统治来镇压台湾人民的一切反抗。条约说：只要“在西太平洋地区对缔约国任何一方领土的武装进攻”都可以被认为是“危及自己的和平和安全的”，而“缔约国”就可以采取行动来对付所谓“共同危险”。
    这是一个美国进一步支持并且利用蒋介石卖国集团来向中华人民共和国发动军事挑衅和武装侵略的条约。条约规定，根据这个条约而采取的侵略行动可以应用于由共同协议而决定的台湾和澎湖列岛以外的其他领土，这就为美国进一步利用蒋介石卖国集团到处寻衅和挑起大战预先作了安排。
