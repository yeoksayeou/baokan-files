The People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province, in order to promote cotton cultivation, issued large amounts of production loans, relief rations, and free agricultural tools to cotton farmers this year; the agricultural technology extension station also focused on helping cotton farmers improve their farming techniques. This year, the cotton planting area in various places generally expanded by about 5% compared to last year.

After harvesting the cotton, cotton farmers of all ethnic groups enthusiastically sold it to the state. State-owned trading companies began purchasing new cotton in October, and by the end of November, they had purchased 230,000 jin of seed cotton. It is expected that the fourth quarter purchase task can be completed before mid-December. Last year, some cotton farmers in mountainous areas waited for trade teams to go up the mountains to purchase cotton; this year, after education by ethnic work teams, the broad masses of cotton farmers recognized the importance of selling cotton to support the country's industrial construction, and they took the initiative to carry cotton to the fixed trade teams in the dams for sale. Last year, the Gasa Street trade team near Nanning Mountain only purchased 138.4 jin of cotton in late November, while this year it purchased 11,089 jin during the same period. By the end of November, state-owned trading companies throughout the region had transported more than 100,000 jin of new cotton to textile factories. (Our Yunnan Reporter Station)

    西双版纳各族农民踊跃卖棉
    云南省西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府为了提倡种棉，今年发放给棉农大批生产贷款、救济口粮和无偿农具；农业技术推广站也有重点地帮助棉农改进了耕作技术。今年各地棉花的种植面积一般比去年扩大了百分之五左右。
    各族棉农摘采棉花以后，踊跃地把棉花卖给国家。国营贸易公司从十月份开始收购新棉，到十一月底已经收购籽棉二十三万斤，预计在十二月中旬以前就可以完成第四季度的收购任务。去年有些山区的棉农只等贸易小组上山来收购棉花；今年经过民族工作队的教育，广大棉农认识了卖棉花支援祖国工业建设的道理，纷纷把棉花背到设在坝子里的固定贸易小组出售。靠近南宁山的戛洒街贸易小组，去年十一月下旬只收购到一百三十八点四斤棉花，今年同时期收购了一万一千零八十九斤。到十一月底，全区国营贸易公司收购的新棉，已经有十万多斤运往纺织工厂。　（本报云南记者站）
