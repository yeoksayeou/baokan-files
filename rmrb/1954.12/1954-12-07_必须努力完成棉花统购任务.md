    This year, except for the flood-affected areas where cotton production decreased, most cotton-producing areas have had bumper harvests, and many cotton-producing areas have exceeded last year's average yield per mu. This is partly due to the cotton farmers' production enthusiasm and the improvement of cotton planting techniques, and partly due to the government's advocacy and material and technical support, such as advance deposits, improved varieties, and the supply of pesticides and machinery, to cotton farmers.
    Although the cotton harvest is good this year, the task of unified purchase has been poorly completed. Only 57% of the monthly plan was completed in September and October. Among them, Zhejiang, Henan, Shanxi, and Shandong provinces have performed poorly in completing the plan, while Hebei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Liaoning provinces are even worse. One of the reasons why the unified purchase plan has not been completed well is that the cotton market season has been delayed this year, but this is not the only reason. Because in September and October, Shaanxi Province completed 116% of the plan, and Sichuan Province exceeded the target by an even larger amount, actually completing 156%. This shows that in those areas that have not completed the plan, in addition to objective reasons, there are still problems in subjective work. Although the cotton purchase situation in various places has improved in November, the Party and governments, supply and marketing cooperatives, and cotton farmers in various places have not paid enough attention to the major task of unified cotton purchase, which must be completed as scheduled. More than 70% of this year's total cotton purchase task must be completed before the end of the year. There are only 20 days left. Not only must the tasks for November and December be guaranteed; the parts that were not completed in September and October must also be made up for during this time.
    Completing the unified cotton purchase task as scheduled is a serious political and economic issue related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. All localities should carefully check the implementation of the plan, and for areas where the plan is poorly completed, leadership must be strengthened to specifically help them solve the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the unified purchase task. In order to strive to complete this year's cotton purchase task, the following issues should be given special attention at present:
    1. The transition from farmers' free sale to the state's unified purchase is a major change in China's economic policy. However, the objective necessity of this change, especially the objective necessity for the country to carry out planned economic construction and reasonably guarantee the needs of the people, has not been fully understood by the majority of farmers. Farmers' understanding often associates the policy of unified purchase and sales with certain individual shortcomings in the work of implementing the policy. Shortcomings in work often affect their understanding of the policy. Therefore, two aspects of work must be carried out. On the one hand, the necessity of implementing the policy of unified purchase and sales must continue to be repeatedly explained to farmers. Arm the rural cadres, Party members, League members, and activists ideologically, first dispel their own ideological concerns, make them realize the necessity and correctness of this policy, strengthen their confidence, and enable them to have sufficient knowledge to answer the questions raised by farmers. This will facilitate their persuasive education work among the broad masses of farmers. On the other hand, it is necessary to carefully check, discover in time, and correct shortcomings and errors in work in time, so that shortcomings in work do not hinder farmers' understanding of the policy. On the contrary, shortcomings in work should be actively overcome to ensure the implementation of the policy. Some cadres have this view of unified purchase and sales, believing that "since cotton has been purchased in a unified manner, it will have to be sold to the state sooner or later," or believing that "unified purchase and sales is like putting on a halter, it's a deal that can't run away." This kind of thinking is incorrect. It can foster a bureaucratic style of being irresponsible to the country and the people, causing unified purchase and sales to fall into a state of laissez-faire, directly affecting the completion of the plan on schedule. In fact, unified purchase and sales is centralized procurement and centralized distribution, which requires greater initiative and more arduous leadership and organizational work than general trade. This kind of thinking must be strictly criticized in order to reverse the current situation in which the task of unified cotton purchase cannot be completed.
    2. Unified purchase of cotton must both complete the state plan and take into account the actual cotton production of cotton farmers. The main problem at present is to ascertain the output, allocate tasks according to the output, and leave self-use portions for cotton farmers. The supply and marketing cooperatives should provide convenience for processing the seed cotton used by cotton farmers for seed retention. This situation must be estimated when allocating tasks. That is, after the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain last year, some farmers did not understand the policy of unified purchase and sale, so they reported more cotton fields and less grain fields this year. Since so much cotton was not planted, it cannot be forced when allocating tasks, but must be based on facts and figures, and calculated according to the actual amount planted, otherwise deviations may occur when allocating tasks. The self-retention part of cotton farmers should not be restricted too strictly. In areas with hand-spinning and hand-weaving habits, the raw material supply for professional and sideline, hand-spinning and hand-weaving households should be properly arranged according to the policy of compressing or maintaining hand-spinning and hand-weaving. Both hand-spinning and hand-weaving are farmers' original habits and part of their livelihood income. However, there are still some differences in the handling of this issue. Farmers' income from hand-spinning is less, and their income from hand-weaving is greater. There is a direct contradiction between cotton used for hand-spinning and cotton used by textile mills, but hand-weaving can still use machine yarn. Therefore, hand-weaving households should be given more consideration, mainly to reasonably solve the cotton yarn supply problem for these weaving households. Taking care of farmers' production and life is one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, some cotton farmers, because they do not understand the policy, "use it quickly" before the unified purchase, do not use old cotton, and try to use new cotton for batting. This inappropriate idea and practice must also be corrected through persuasion and explanation. Because this means he sells less money for himself, and for the country it is a waste of cotton that can be used for the textile industry. At present, the cotton harvesting season is coming to an end, and farmers will pull the stalks and clean the land to prepare for winter plowing. Some cotton farmers believe that most of the cotton has been picked, and the remaining late cotton bolls and broken bolls are not worth picking up. This is also wrong. According to a survey in Miaozhuang Township, Dezhou, Shandong Province, if it is really picked and cleaned, each mu can pick up twelve taels to one jin more cotton. This is beneficial to cotton farmers for self-use; calculated according to the national cotton field area, this number is even more considerable. Therefore, we should seize this time to call on cotton farmers to "pick and clean" to make up for the shortage of cotton for use. In short, we should help cotton farmers in all aspects, so that they can truly realize the unity of personal interests and national interests, so that the task of unified cotton purchase can be completed more smoothly.
    3. Unified purchase of cotton, as an economic work, must pay special attention to a simple principle, that is, the small-scale peasant economy needs commodity exchange, and farmers sell in order to buy. Since the country needs farmers' cotton, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives must try their best to supply various commodities needed by cotton farmers, and today this aspect of work is still not done well enough, which also affects the completion of the unified cotton purchase task. There are some new situations here that must be paid attention to in the work. Unified purchase requires cotton farmers to sell all the cotton produced (except for the necessary self-use part) to the state at the price stipulated by the state within a certain period of time. In this way, certain commodities needed by farmers also need to be supplied in a concentrated manner within a short period of time. For example, grain should be supplied to cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas according to quarterly plans, and the variety should be as convenient as possible for cotton farmers. The same should be true for coal and salt. The purchasing power of cotton-producing areas has always been relatively high. This year, the cotton fiber content in bumper areas is large, the quality is good, and the state implements preferential prices for superior grades, so cotton farmers' purchasing power will be even higher than in previous years. However, grain, cloth, and oil are all subject to planned supply, which has caused great changes in cotton farmers' demand for industrial products and non-staple foods this year. Not only do low-grade industrial products have sales in cotton-producing areas, but also relatively high-grade industrial products have very strong sales. However, we have obviously underestimated this new situation. As soon as cotton went on the market, the phenomenon of industrial product out-of-stock quickly appeared. At present, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives are actively organizing industrial products to go to the countryside, and the out-of-stock situation has been reversed, but we cannot yet think that everything has been well arranged, because in fact there is still a lack of investigation and research on the changes in the needs of cotton farmers, especially on the needs of specific commodity varieties, the supply of goods is not timely enough, and the organization of commodity circulation is not rational enough. That is to say, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives must redouble their efforts in the supply of goods in order to better cooperate with the smooth progress of the unified cotton purchase work.
    4. To concentrate on completing this year's cotton purchase task in just over twenty days. Because the time is short and the tasks are concentrated, the plans for each link in the entire process, from purchase, storage, and processing to delivery to the textile mill, must be carefully and specifically arranged. In the past, some areas implemented the method of limited purchase due to warehouse restrictions at the grassroots purchase stations. This must be changed. We should actively promote the methods of dividing areas, designating locations, and setting times to conduct organized purchases to reduce congestion and save farmers' sales time. The labor organization for grade inspection, weighing, and warehousing at the purchase station must be rationally adjusted according to the size of the purchase volume. Procedures should be simplified as much as possible. Due to the concentration of unified purchase of cotton, grain, and oil, there is a shortage of rural transportation capacity, which must be rationally allocated. In addition to strengthening the work of power ginning and packaging, the main thing is to rationally and quickly organize manual ginning, especially in areas where more lint cotton has been purchased in the past, this should be given more attention. The transportation work of automobiles and trains must be planned, otherwise the limited warehouses below will inevitably affect the progress of the entire work. This series of work must be recalculated and arranged according to the current purchase task at each link. Each link must be checked so that the entire work can be connected up and down in the specific arrangement. Only in this way can the unified cotton purchase plan become the actual action of millions of people, and the plan can fully exert its mobilizing role.
    Purchasing cotton is one of the central tasks of the entire Party at present. Party committees at all levels must pay attention to it, strengthen leadership over cotton purchasing work, and take various effective measures to inspect and supervise the cooperative's cotton purchasing work, and provide them with necessary support and assistance. Party committees at all levels must pay attention to and properly resolve the various issues in the relationship with cotton farmers.

### 必须努力完成棉花统购任务

    必须努力完成棉花统购任务
    今年棉花除水灾地区减产外，一般棉产区都获得丰收，并有不少棉产区超过去年每亩平均产量。这一方面是由于棉农生产积极，种棉技术有进步，另一方面也是由于政府提倡，并且在物质上和技术上，如预付定金，改良品种，农药械的供应等，对棉农给了不少的帮助和支持。
    今年棉花收成虽好，统购任务却完成得很差。九、十月份仅完成月计划的百分之五十七。其中浙江、河南、山西、山东等省完成计划较差，河北、江苏、江西、湖北、湖南、辽宁等省则更差。统购计划完成得不好的原因之一，是今年棉花上市季节推迟，但这不是唯一的原因。因为在九、十月份，陕西省就完成了计划的百分之一百一十六，四川省超额完成的数目更大，实际完成百分之一百五十六。这就说明在那些未完成计划的地区，除客观原因外，在主观工作上仍有问题。十一月份各地收购棉花情况虽有好转，但各地党和政府、供销合作社和棉农，对于棉花统购这一重大任务未能如期完成，仍须给以极大的注意。今年棉花全部统购任务的百分之七十以上必须在年底之前完成，时间仅有二十几天，不仅要保证完成十一、十二月份的任务；九、十月份未完成部分，也须要在这时间之内争取补齐。
    如期完成棉花统购任务，是关系国计民生的一个严重的政治和经济问题。各地应认真地检查计划的执行情况，对于完成计划较差的地区，必须加强领导，具体地帮助他们解决在统购任务执行中所遇到的困难。为了争取完成本年度的棉花统购任务，目前应特别注意以下几个问题：
    一、从农民自由出售到国家实行统购，是我国经济政策上的一个重大转变。但这种转变的客观必要性，特别是对于国家进行计划经济建设和合理保障人民需要的客观必要性，还没有为广大农民所完全理解，而农民的认识又往往是将统购统销的政策与执行政策中间工作上的某些个别缺点联系起来看待的。工作上的缺点往往影响到他们对政策的认识。因此就必须进行两方面的工作。一方面必须将实行统购统销政策的必要性，向农民继续反复地讲清楚。将农村干部、党员、团员和积极分子在思想上武装起来，首先解除他们自己的思想顾虑，使他们认识这一政策的必要性和正确性，坚定他们的信心，并使他们有足够的知识来解答农民所提出的问题。这样才便于他们向广大农民进行说服教育工作。另一方面，必须认真检查，及时发现，及时改正工作中的缺点和错误，不要使工作中的缺点妨碍农民对政策的认识，相反的，应积极克服工作中的缺点，以保证政策的贯彻执行。有些干部对统购统销有这样一种看法，认为“棉花既然统购了，早晚都得卖给国家”，或者认为“统购统销是带上了笼头，跑不了的买卖”。这种思想是不正确的。它可以养成一种对国家对人民不负责任的官僚主义作风，使统购统销陷于自流状态，直接影响着计划的按期完成。实际统购统销是集中采购和集中分配，比一般贸易需要更大的主动性，需要更艰巨的领导和组织工作。必须对这种思想加以严格的批判，才能扭转目前棉花统购不能完成任务的情况。
    二、统购棉花既须完成国家计划，又须照顾到棉农产棉的实际情况。当前的主要问题是摸清产量，根据产量分配任务，并须给棉农留下自用部分，对棉农留种用的籽棉，供销合作社应给以加工的便利。在分配任务的时候必须估计到这种情况，就是去年实行粮食统购统销之后，有些农民不了解统购统销政策，因而今年多报棉田、少报粮田。既然没有种那么多棉花，在分配任务时就不能强求，而必须实事求是，实际种多少，算多少，否则在分配任务时就可能发生偏差。对棉农自留部分不宜限制过严，在有手纺手织习惯的地区，应根据对手纺手织压缩或维持的方针，分别地对专业和副业、手纺和手织户的原料供应作妥善的安排。手纺和手织都是农民原有的习惯和生活收入的一部分来源。但在这一问题的处理上仍有所区别。农民手纺的收入少，手织的收入大。手纺用棉与纱厂用棉有直接矛盾，但手织则仍可利用机纱。因此对手织户应照顾多些，主要是合理地解决这些织布户的棉纱供应问题。对于农民的生产和生活加以照顾，这是问题的一个方面。另一方面对于有些棉农由于不了解政策，便不等统购，“先用快装”，不利用旧棉，而尽量用新棉作絮花的不妥当想法和作法，也须经过说服解释，加以纠正。因为这对于他自己是少卖了钱，对于国家则是浪费了可以用于纺织工业的棉花。目前棉花收获季节已近结束，农民就要拔秆净地，准备冬耕。有的棉农认为大部分棉花已经摘完，剩下的晚棉桃、破桃，不值得收拾。这也是不对的。据山东省德州苗庄乡的调查，如果真正摘完拾净，每亩可多拾十二两到一斤棉花。这对于棉农自用不无补益；按全国棉田面积推算，这个数字就更可观了。因此应抓紧这个时间号召棉农“摘完拾净”，以补用棉的不足。总之，应当从各方面帮助棉农，使他们能真正体会到个人利益和国家利益的一致，这才能更顺利地完成棉花统购的任务。
    三、统购棉花，作为经济工作来说，必须特别注意一个简单的道理，就是小农经济需要商品交换，农民是为买而卖的。既然国家需要农民的棉花，国营商业和合作社就必须尽量供应棉农所需要的各种商品，而今天这方面的工作还作得很不够，也就影响着棉花统购任务的完成。这里有些新情况是必须在工作中加以注意的。统购是要求棉农将所产棉花（除留必要的自用部分外），按照国家规定的价格在一定时期内全部出售给国家。这样，农民所需要的某些商品也就需要集中在短时期内供应。例如，粮食对棉区棉农应当按季计划供应，并应在品种上尽可能便利棉农，煤、盐也应如此。棉产区的购买力一向是比较高的，今年丰产区棉花衣分大，质量好，国家又实行优级优价，棉农的购买力就比往年还要高一些。但粮、布、油都在实行计划供应，这就使今年棉农对于工业品副食品的需求上起了很大的变化。不仅低级工业品在棉区有销路，就是较高级的工业品，销路也很旺。而我们对于这一新情况显然估计不足，棉花一上市，很快就出现工业品脱销现象。现在国营商业和合作社正在积极组织工业品下乡，脱销情况已有扭转，但目前还不能就认为都已经有了很好的安排，因为实际上对于棉农需要的变化，特别是对具体商品品种需要的变化，还缺乏调查研究，商品供应还不够及时，商品流转的组织还不够合理。这就是说，国营商业和合作社在商品供应方面还必须加倍地努力，才能更好地配合棉花统购工作的顺利进行。
    四、要集中在二十几天内，争取完成今年的棉花统购任务。由于时间短，任务集中，从收购、保管、加工，到运交纱厂，这全部过程的每一个环节的计划都须要加以很好的具体安排。在基层收购站，过去有些地区由于仓库限制，实行限量收购的办法必须改变。应积极推广划片、定点、定时的办法，进行有组织的收购，以减少拥挤现象，节约农民的出售时间。收购站验级、过磅、入库的劳动力组织必须根据收购量的大小加以合理调整。手续则应力求简化，由于棉粮油料统购的集中，农村运输力不足，必须加以合理调配。轧花打包除加强动力轧花工作外，主要的应是合理地迅速地组织人力轧花，尤其是过去收购皮棉多的地区，更应重视这一点。汽车火车的运输工作更须有计划的安排，否则下面仓库有限，必将影响整个工作的进程。这一系列工作，在每个环节上，都必须根据目前的收购任务，重新加以计算和安排。对每个环节都必须进行检查，使整个工作在具体安排上能上下衔接。必须这样，才能使棉花统购计划成为千百万人底活的实际行动，计划才能充分发挥它的动员作用。
    收购棉花是目前全党的中心任务之一。各级党委必须加以重视，加强对棉花收购工作的领导，并采取各种有效措施检查和监督合作社收棉工作，要给他们以必需的支持和帮助。在同棉农关系上的各项问题，尤须各级党委注意并妥善地加以解决。
