    Many Factories and Mines Fulfill Annual Plans Ahead of Schedule
    [Report from this newspaper] Many factories and mines have completed their annual plans ahead of schedule. The broad masses of workers and staff in these factories and mines have successively formulated new production plans to ensure that they will not slacken their efforts at the end of the year, and will produce more wealth for the country.
    The state-owned Tangshan Steel Plant had already fulfilled and overfulfilled the annual total output value plan and profit delivery plan by the end of November. The production plans for the main products, steel and steel材, have also been overfulfilled. Steel production exceeded the plan by 12.4 percent, and steel材 exceeded the plan by 29.73 percent. The state-owned Shanghai Smelting Plant completed the annual production plan for electrolytic copper thirty-six days ahead of schedule. The Harbin Ball Bearing Factory completed the annual national production and financial plan in an all-round and overfulfilled manner one month and two days ahead of schedule. Among them, in addition to completing the profit delivery plan 100 percent and completing the cost target two months ahead of schedule, the new product trial production task was also completed one month and seven days ahead of schedule. In addition, the product variety indicators that the state gave to this factory this year have also been overfulfilled. The joint state-private Wuhan Huaxin Cement Plant completed the annual national plan in an all-round manner twenty-nine days ahead of schedule. This year's planned cement production of this factory increased by 8.65 percent compared with the actual production of the whole year last year, and the labor productivity of the whole factory this year increased by 28.5 percent compared with last year. The state-owned Xiangshan Pyrite Mine completed the annual production plan ahead of schedule. The Huainan Xiejiaji No. 2 Vertical Shaft completed the annual well construction task nearly a month ahead of schedule.
    Many factories and mines continue to carry out labor competitions after completing their annual plans. Each workshop and more than three-quarters of the production teams of the state-owned Shanghai Smelting Plant have formulated plans to increase production and practice economy in the last month of this year. The workers launched a labor competition to implement the new indicators. From December 3, the workers and staff of the joint state-private Wuhan Huaxin Cement Plant have been carrying out production according to the newly formulated plan to increase production by 36,000 tons of cement. The workers and staff of the state-owned Xiangshan Pyrite Mine are working hard to overfulfill the plan to increase production by 15,000 tons of pyrite ore. The workers and staff of the Huainan Xiejiaji No. 2 Vertical Shaft have now started doing the work in next year's plan. They are determined to excavate another 100 meters of rock and build 33 meters more for the country by the end of the year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, 6th - The geological drilling team of the Benxi Mining Bureau, which provides geological data for the second phase of the Caitun Coal Mine construction project, overfulfilled the annual drilling plan on November 30.
    This year, this drilling team used all 1,000-meter drilling rigs to explore the geological conditions of the deep part of the Caitun coalfield. Originally, the drilling efficiency and coal core recovery rate of the drilling team were not high. In the second half of the year, due to the implementation of the safety production policy, the workers strictly abided by the operating procedures and paid attention to the cleanliness of the boreholes, so the drilling rig accidents were greatly reduced, and the pure drilling time gradually increased month by month. In October, the pure drilling time increased by one to two times compared with the months in the first half of the year. The coal seam in this coalfield is loose and fragile, and it is very difficult to take coal cores. This spring, the veteran worker Qi Daozuo came up with a new coal core sampler based on the Soviet waterless pump drilling experience. After testing, the effect was very good, and loose and fragile coal cores were also extracted. In November, the coal core recovery rate reached 75 percent, and the cost was also saved by more than 500 million yuan.

    许多厂矿提前完成全年计划
    【本报讯】许多工厂、矿山提前完成全年计划。这些工厂、矿山中的广大职工，纷纷订出新的生产计划，保证年终决不松劲，为国家增产更多财富。
    国营唐山钢厂到十一月底已经提前和超额完成全年的生产总值计划和上缴利润计划，主要产品钢和钢材的生产计划也已超额完成。钢的产量超过计划百分之十二点四，钢材超过计划百分之二十九点七三。国营上海冶炼厂已提前三十六天完成了全年电解铜的生产计划。哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂提前一个月零两天，全面超额完成全年国家生产财务计划。其中除上缴利润百分之百地完成计划，成本指标提前两个月完成计划外，新产品试制任务也提前一个月零七天完成了计划。另外，国家今年给这个工厂的生产品种指标也超额完成了。公私合营武汉华新水泥厂提前二十九天全面完成了全年国家计划。这个工厂今年的水泥计划产量比去年全年的实际产量增加百分之八点六五，今年全厂工人的劳动生产率比去年提高了百分之二十八点五。国营向山硫化铁矿提前完成全年生产计划。淮南谢家集二号竖井提前近一个月完成全年建井任务。
    许多工厂、矿山在完成全年计划后，继续开展劳动竞赛。国营上海冶炼厂各车间和四分之三以上的生产小组订出了今年最后一个月的增产节约计划。职工们展开了执行新指标的劳动竞赛。公私合营武汉华新水泥厂职工，从十二月三日起，已按照新制订的增产三万六千吨水泥的计划，进行生产。国营向山硫化铁矿全矿职工，正在为超额完成增产一万五千吨硫化铁矿石的计划而努力。淮南谢家集二号竖井职工，现在已开始做明年计划中的工作，他们决心到年底再为国家多掘进岩石一百公尺，并砌好三十三公尺。
    【新华社本溪六日电】为彩屯煤矿第二期建设工程提供地质资料的本溪矿务局地质钻探队，十一月三十日超额完成了全年钻探计划。
    今年这个钻探队全部使用一千公尺的钻机，钻探彩屯煤田深部的地质情况。原来，钻探队的钻进效率和煤芯采取率都不高，下半年由于贯彻安全生产方针，工人们严格遵守操作规程，注意钻孔内的清洁，因而钻机事故大大减少，纯钻进时间逐月增加。十月份纯钻进时间比上半年各月提高一倍到两倍。这块煤田的煤层松散易碎，采取煤芯很困难。今年春天，老工人綦道佐根据苏联无水泵钻进经验，想出一种新的煤芯采取器，经过试验效果很好，松散易碎的煤芯也采出来了。十一月份煤芯采取率达到了百分之七十五，成本费也节省了五亿多元。
