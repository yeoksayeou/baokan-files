    Pastureland Expanded on the Southern Slope of the Qilian Mountains
    The Sunan Yugur Autonomous Region in Gansu Province has expanded its pastureland this year. This new pastureland is several times larger than the original grazing area. This winter, a group of herdsmen and more than 20,000 livestock have settled here.
    The new pastureland is located on the southern slope of the Qilian Mountains, with lush grass. This year, the number of livestock in the entire region has increased by 24.8 percent compared to last year, and the original grassland was no longer sufficient, so the herdsmen came to this new pastureland.
    Currently, the Autonomous Region People's Government is preparing to organize mobile trade groups to supply the herdsmen with various daily necessities in the new pastureland.

    祁连山南麓扩大放牧草原
    甘肃省肃南裕固族自治区今年扩大了放牧草原。这片新草原比原有放牧的草原大好几倍。今年冬季已有一批牧民和两万多头牲畜在这里安居下来。
    新草原在祁连山南麓，牧草丰茂。今年由于全区的牲畜比去年增加了百分之二十四点八，原有的草原已经不够用，所以牧民们就来到了这片新草原。
    现在，自治区人民政府正准备组织流动贸易组，到新草原上，供应牧民各种生活用品。（新华社）
