Five Resolutions of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council Meeting

Resolution on the Situation in Guatemala

In June 1954, due to the armed intervention supported and instigated by North American imperialism, a regime of terror was established in Guatemala, which deprived all democratic freedoms and trade union rights.

One of the first acts of the criminal regime of Castillo Armas was the murder of the leaders of the victorious strike by agricultural workers of the "United Fruit Company" to demand higher wages.

Currently, the Guatemalan Workers' Confederation and the Guatemalan National Farmers' Association have been declared illegal. Not long ago, twenty trade union leaders were sentenced to death, including Hernández, Adan, Conde, Camille, and Tobar. Peasants were deprived of the land they had obtained through land reform. These lands fell back into the hands of the "United Fruit Company," large landowners, and priests. The countryside was burned, and rural residents were killed. Leaders of the labor movement, democrats, and patriots who had taken refuge in other Latin American countries became the targets of new persecutions. They were threatened with extradition to the Guatemalan dictator.

More than ten thousand patriots imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps are constantly under the threat of death. In this country with a population of only three million, seven thousand two hundred people are blacklisted.

International support from working people can restore freedom to Guatemalan patriots and ensure democratic freedoms and trade union rights.

Therefore, the Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions calls on the working people of all countries and all trade union organizations to continue to expand international support for the working class, peasants, and all people of Guatemala.

The struggle of the Guatemalan working people and all people, supported by the international working people, is the most reliable guarantee of success.

Resolution on the Situation in Spain

The Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions, meeting in Warsaw from December 9 to 14, 1954, notes that the fascist regime of Franco is continuing to implement its policy of persecution and terror against the workers and people of Spain.

Franco's prisons remain filled with thousands of political prisoners and workers arrested for defending the social and economic interests of the working people. Those who strive to improve living and working conditions, restore democratic freedoms, and fight for national independence and peace are the first to be persecuted and arrested.

The people of Spain, with the solidarity of the international working people, respond to Franco's persecution with heroic struggles. The release of G. Lo Remondo, the leader of the general strike in Barcelona in 1951, and the saving of the lives of T. Torres, Lu. Aribas, and many other anti-Franco fighters sentenced to long terms of hard labor, are the results of the struggle of the Spanish people and the solidarity of the international working people. These great achievements prove how effective the actions of the workers are, and prove that efforts must be stepped up to support the struggle of the Spanish people.

The Council once again expresses sympathy and support for the Spanish patriots who have suffered persecution by the Franco government.

The Council calls on trade union organizations in all countries to organize to rescue the imprisoned anti-Franco fighters, including trade union activist T. Torres, Lu. Aribas, as well as José Maria Sandros and thirty-seven young patriots.

The Council believes that the struggle of the Spanish people and the solidarity of the international working people can and will stop Franco's persecution and ensure that the democratic freedoms and trade union rights of the Spanish working people are realized.

Resolution on the Situation in Algeria

The Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions strongly protests against the French government's brutal persecution in Algeria, the mad arrests, the suppression of democratic and trade union rights, and the military operations carried out by the French government in Algeria.

The Council condemns the colonial system that oppresses the Algerian people, which is the real cause of the serious events now taking place in Algeria. This system leaves the vast majority of the working people of Algeria suffering from poverty and unemployment, it prevents the true representatives of the people from participating in the management of their own country's affairs, and stifles the development of national culture.

The Council reiterates that the World Federation of Trade Unions will fully support the just struggle of the Algerian working people and all people to achieve economic and social demands, national independence, and peace.

Resolution on the Situation in Iran

The brutal policy of terror now being carried out in Iran against the working people—including trade union members, workers' leaders, and other democrats—has aroused the dissatisfaction and righteous anger of working people throughout the world.

Thousands of Iranian patriots, including many workers and workers' leaders, have been illegally imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps, deprived of all rights, subjected to various tortures, and are at any time under the threat of execution or death.

These measures are aimed at those who oppose the imperialist trusts and the Iranian reactionary government's measures to abolish the nationalization law of the oil industry and to re-plunder the people's resources. The Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions firmly protests against these anti-democratic and inhuman actions taken by the Iranian government.

The participants in the Council meeting pay tribute to the heroic victims of Iran and assure their families that the working people of the world are united in sympathy with them. The Council is confident that the Iranian working people, who have undergone many severe tests, will continue their just struggle with renewed strength and heroism.

The Council calls on trade union organizations in all countries to take all possible actions to support the struggle of the Iranian working people for economic, social, and democratic demands, and for national independence and peace.

Resolution on the Situation in Greece

The Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions exposes and condemns the policy of the Greek government to suppress trade union rights and democratic freedoms.

At present, the most prominent feature of this policy is the consistent and brutal persecution of the outstanding representatives of the Greek working people who are fighting for the satisfaction of the social and economic demands of the working people, for national independence, and for peace.

The Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions believes that the Greek working people, by continuously strengthening unity of action in the struggle to improve living conditions, will certainly be able to rescue all those who have been arrested and exiled, and will certainly be able to achieve amnesty and the free exercise of trade union rights.

The Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions warmly salutes the heroic Greek working people and once again assures them that they will receive the fraternal solidarity of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the active support of the working people of the world in this struggle.

    世界工联理事会会议的五项决议
    关于危地马拉的局势的决议
    一九五四年六月间，由于发生在北美帝国主义的支持和策动下的武装干涉，在危地马拉建立了恐怖政权，这个政权剥夺了一切民主自由和工会权利。
    卡斯蒂略·阿马斯的罪恶政权的最初活动之一就是杀害了“联合果品公司”的农业工人为争取提高工资而进行胜利的罢工的领导人。
      目前，危地马拉工人联合会和危地马拉全国农民协会都被宣布为非法。不久以前，有二十名工会领导人被判处死刑，其中有：埃尔南迪斯、阿当、康德、卡米伊和托巴尔。农民被剥夺了他们通过土地改革所获得的土地。这些土地又落到“联合果品公司”、大地主和牧师的手中。农村被火烧毁，农村的居民被杀害。在拉丁美洲其他国家中避难的工人运动领袖、民主人士和爱国者，都成为新的迫害的对象。他们遭到被引渡到危地马拉独裁者手里的威胁。
    囚禁在监狱和集中营中的一万多名爱国者，经常处在死亡的威胁下。在只有三百万人口的这个国家里，列入黑名单的就有七千二百人。
    劳动人民的国际支援可以使危地马拉爱国者恢复自由，使民主自由和工会权利得到保障。
    因此，世界工会联合会理事会号召世界各国劳动人民和一切工会组织继续扩大对危地马拉的工人阶级、农民以及全体人民的国际支援。
    在国际劳动人民支持下危地马拉劳动人民和全体人民进行的斗争，是获得成功的最可靠的保证。
    关于西班牙局势的决议
    从一九五四年十二月九日到十四日在华沙举行会议的世界工会联合会理事会注意到，佛朗哥的法西斯政权正在继续执行对西班牙工人和人民实行迫害和恐怖的政策。
    佛朗哥的监狱仍然关满了数以千计的政治犯和由于保卫劳动人民的社会和经济利益而被捕的工人。遭到迫害和逮捕的首先是那些争取改善生活条件和劳动条件、争取恢复民主自由、争取民族独立和和平的工人和爱国者。
    西班牙的人民在国际劳动人民的声援下，以英勇的斗争来回答佛朗哥的迫害。一九五一年巴塞罗那总罢工的领导人格·洛·雷蒙多获得释放，以及特·托列斯、路·阿里巴斯和其他许多被判处长期苦役的反对佛朗哥战士的生命被拯救，正就是西班牙人民的斗争和国际劳动人民的声援的结果。这些巨大的成就证明工人的行动是多么有效，证明必须加紧努力来支持西班牙人民的斗争。
    理事会再一次向遭受佛朗哥政府迫害的西班牙爱国者表示同情和支援。
    理事会号召各国的工会组织起来营救被监禁的反对佛朗哥的战士，包括工会活动家特·托列斯、路·阿里巴斯，以及何塞·玛丽亚·桑德罗斯和三十七名青年爱国者。
    理事会相信，西班牙人民的斗争和国际劳动人民的声援能够而且一定会制止佛朗哥的迫害、保证西班牙劳动人民的民主自由和工会权利得以实现。
    关于阿尔及利亚局势的决议
    世界工会联合会理事会坚决抗议法国政府在阿尔及利亚所进行的残酷迫害、疯狂逮捕、对民主权利和工会权利的镇压、以及法国政府在阿尔及利亚所进行的军事行动。
    理事会谴责压迫阿尔及利亚人民的殖民地制度，这种制度是现在在阿尔及利亚发生的严重事件的真正原因。这种制度使得阿尔及利亚绝大多数的劳动人民遭受贫困和失业，它不让人民的真正代表参加管理自己本国的事务，并且窒息民族文化的发展。
    理事会再一次声明，世界工会联合会将完全支持阿尔及利亚的劳动人民和全体人民为争取满足经济和社会要求，争取民族独立和和平而进行的正义斗争。
    关于伊朗局势的决议
    现在伊朗国内对劳动人民——包括工会会员、工人领袖和其他民主人士——所施行的横暴的恐怖政策已经激起全世界劳动人民的不满和正当的愤怒。
    数以千计的伊朗爱国者，包括许多劳动者和工人领袖，已经被非法关入监狱和集中营，被剥夺了各种权利，遭到了各种拷问，随时都有受刑或者死亡的威胁。
    这些措施是针对那些反对帝国主义托辣斯和伊朗反动政府废除石油工业国有化法和重新掠夺人民富源措施的人的。世界工会联合会理事会坚决抗议伊朗政府采取这些反民主的和惨无人道的行动。
    理事会会议的参加者向伊朗英勇的牺牲者致念，并向他们的家属保证：全世界劳动人民是一致同情他们的。理事会确信，经过许多严重考验的伊朗劳动人民将以新的力量和英勇精神继续进行自己的正义斗争。
    理事会向各国工会组织号召：采取一切可能的行动来支持伊朗劳动人民为争取满足经济、社会和民主要求，争取国家独立和和平而进行的斗争。
  关于希腊局势的决议
    世界工会联合会理事会揭露和谴责希腊政府所执行的镇压工会权利和民主自由的政策。
    目前，这种政策的最突出的特征是一贯残酷地迫害为争取满足劳动人民的社会和经济要求、争取民族独立和和平而斗争的希腊劳动人民的优秀代表。
    世界工会联合会理事会相信，希腊劳动人民在争取改善生活条件的斗争中不断加强行动一致，就一定能够营救出一切被捕者和被流放者，一定能够争取到实行大赦以及自由行使工会权利。
    世界工会联合会理事会向英勇的希腊劳动人民热烈致敬，并且再次向他们保证，他们在这个斗争中将得到世界工会联合会的兄弟般的声援和全世界劳动人民的积极支持。
