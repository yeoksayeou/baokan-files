    Continuing to Advance on the Basis of Victory
    – Written to Celebrate the Full Opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways
    Zhang Guohua, Commander of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    As the second year of the motherland's First Five-Year Economic Construction Plan is about to conclude, we are celebrating with great excitement the simultaneous full opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways to Lhasa. This is another major achievement in our people's construction endeavors. With the opening of these two major highways, the distance between the frontier region of Tibet and the capital Beijing has been greatly shortened, the ties between the Tibetan people and their fraternal ethnic groups in the interior of the motherland have been more closely connected, the cultural and economic exchanges between the fraternal ethnic groups have been further enhanced, and the unity between the fraternal ethnic groups has been further strengthened. At the same time, more importantly, it has created more favorable conditions for all parts of the country to support and help the Tibetan people in their construction in the future. The opening of these two major highways demonstrates the great concern of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and Chairman Mao for the Tibetan people and the Tibetan region, bringing an infinitely bright future to the Tibetan people. The Tibetan people call this highway "the road to prosperity and happiness" and "Chairman Mao's road."

    From the very beginning of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's entry into Tibet, Chairman Mao instructed all troops and personnel entering Tibet to "advance while building roads" in order to help the Tibetan people develop their political, economic, and cultural undertakings. He then further instructed, "In order to help all fraternal ethnic groups, fear no difficulties and work hard to build roads!" Over the years, the People's Liberation Army and personnel entering Tibet, as well as the people of all ethnic groups supporting the construction of Tibet, have resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions and began the construction of the Kangzang Highway at the same time as the initial advance, followed by the construction of the Qingzang Highway. In the process of building the roads, they fought year-round in snow-capped mountains and grasslands over 3,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level, never putting down their weapons – hammers, steel drills, shovels, and picks. They displayed a high degree of patriotism, with great labor enthusiasm and wisdom, amazing perseverance, and a tenacious fighting will, overcoming all the difficulties given to them by nature and eliminating all obstacles on the road ahead. They cut through the entire Hengduan Mountains, cleaved the Kunlun Mountains, the Tanggula Mountains, and the Que'er Mountains, conquered the Qinghai grasslands with thousands of miles uninhabited, passed through the Tongtian River, and overcame the natural barrier of the Nujiang River... In order to support the Tibetan people and build the frontier, they said: No mountain is higher than our will, and no stone is harder than our bones. Only by conquering the grasslands can we develop the grasslands. Over the years, according to statistics, the Kangzang Highway alone involved over 20 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, the construction of bridges with a total length of over 6,000 meters, the construction of over 3,600 culverts, and the crossing of more than ten mountains over 3,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level, and more than ten famous rivers such as the Dadu River, the Yalong River, the Jinsha River, the Lancang River, the Nujiang River, and the Lhasa River. In completing such an arduous road construction project, the people of all ethnic groups, especially the Han, Tibetan, Miao, Hui, Mongolian, and Kazakh peoples in various parts of the motherland, especially in the Southwest and Northwest, provided great assistance in terms of grain, materials, equipment, tools, manpower, material resources, and transportation. The people who grew up in the great Mao Zedong era are so closely united, helping each other and cooperating, using their labor and wisdom to jointly build the big family of the motherland, build the frontier of the motherland, and create their own happiness.

    The Tibetan people are brave and hardworking, and the products and resources of Tibet are abundant. On the vast northern Tibetan plateau, there is a natural pasture, rich in world-renowned Tibetan wool, large quantities of leather, ghee and cheese, as well as precious caterpillar fungus, deer antlers and musk. In the Yarlung Tsangpo River basin and the Lhasa plain, there is a rich agricultural area, rich in highland barley, wheat and peas. Primeval forests stretch for hundreds of miles in some places. Underground mineral deposits that have been discovered include gold, silver, coal, iron, lake salt, and borax with considerable reserves. However, due to the aggression of imperialism and the discrimination and oppression of successive reactionary rulers in the last hundred years, coupled with inconvenient transportation and natural geographical conditions, these rich underground treasures have long failed to be exploited, and large quantities of native products and specialties have not been well developed, thus causing the Tibetan people to be trapped in poverty for a long time.

    After the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways, cities along the Kangzang Highway such as Ganzi, Dege, Qamdo, Songzong, and Tai Zhao have established banks, telecommunications bureaus, state-owned trading companies, etc. Commerce is becoming increasingly prosperous and the population is increasing. Newly built towns have also appeared along the route, such as Xinluhai, Zhamu and many "grassland homes." On the northern Tibetan plateau, on the banks of the Tongtian River, state-owned trade groups have also appeared, transporting cheap daily necessities from the interior to supply the people in the pastoral areas, and finding sales outlets for the pastoral areas' native products and specialties. After the highway opened to Lhasa, the freight rate from Qamdo to Lhasa was reduced by 28%. Of course, these are only the beginning. In the future, under the established policy of gradually developing Tibet's agriculture, animal husbandry, industry and commerce, and improving people's lives, we will certainly develop the economy of the Tibetan region in a more organized and planned way, strengthen material exchanges, develop native products and specialties, establish local industries, and improve the lives of the broad masses of people.

    The opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways has created more favorable conditions for the Tibetan people to develop their political, economic and cultural construction undertakings. The bright future of a prosperous and happy new Tibet has gradually appeared before our eyes. However, we must not ignore the natural geographical conditions of the Tibetan region, nor can we depart from the current historical stage of development of the Tibetan people. We must correctly recognize that eliminating the existing de facto inequality and joining the ranks of advanced ethnic groups is by no means something that can be accomplished overnight. We must abide by the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," which stipulates that we must "act in accordance with the actual conditions of Tibet," and abide by the Constitution, which stipulates that "the state shall take into account the needs of all ethnic groups in the process of economic and cultural construction, and shall pay full attention to the characteristics of the development of all ethnic groups on the issue of socialist transformation." As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his report on the draft Constitution: "On all these issues, the people of all ethnic groups and the public leaders in all ethnic groups who are connected with the people should be allowed to consider these issues at their leisure and make decisions according to their wishes." "It can be realized gradually with more time and in a more moderate way."

    Over the years, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the great leader Chairman Mao, with the strong support of the people of the whole country, especially the Tibetan people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the staff working in Tibet have united closely with the Tibetan people, correctly implemented ethnic policies and religious policies, worked diligently, and helped the Tibetan people to carry out construction, winning the love and trust of the monks and lay people of all strata in Tibet. But this is only a good start. In the future, with the opening of the two major highways, the task of building the frontier - Tibet - that lies before us will be even more arduous and heavy. We must strengthen national unity better on the basis of the existing victories, faithfully implement the Peaceful Agreement, learn from the spirit of hard work and overcoming nature of the road construction troops, promote the spirit of patriotism, serve the people wholeheartedly, and strive to the end for the socialist construction of the motherland, for the construction of the frontier of the motherland, and for the construction of a new Tibet.

### 在胜利的基础上继续前进——为庆祝康藏、青藏公路全线通车而作

    在胜利的基础上继续前进
    ——为庆祝康藏、青藏公路全线通车而作
    中国人民解放军西藏军区司令员　张国华
    当祖国第一个五年经济建设计划第二年度行将结束的时候，我们以万分兴奋的心情，热烈地庆祝康藏、青藏公路同时全线通车拉萨。这是我国人民建设事业中的又一重大成就。随着这两大公路干线的通车，大大缩短了边疆西藏同首都北京的距离，更密切地沟通了西藏民族同祖国内地各兄弟民族的联系，进一步地增进了各兄弟民族之间的文化、经济交流，进一步加强了各兄弟民族间的团结；同时，更重要的是为全国各地在今后支援和帮助西藏民族进行建设中，创造了更加有利的条件。这两大公路干线的通车，表现了共产党、人民政府和毛主席对西藏民族和西藏地区的巨大关怀，给西藏人民带来了无限美好的远景，西藏人民把这条公路叫做“走向繁荣幸福的路”、“毛主席的路”。
    中国人民解放军进藏开始，毛主席即指示所有进藏部队和工作人员为了帮助西藏民族政治、经济和文化事业的发展，“一面进军，一面修路”，接着又指示，“为了帮助各兄弟民族，不怕困难，努力筑路！”数年来，进藏的人民解放军和工作人员，以及支援西藏民族进行建设的各族民工，坚决地遵循着毛主席的指示，与开始进军的同时，就开始了康藏公路的修筑工程，接着又修筑青藏公路。在筑路的过程中，他们常年地转战在三千公尺到五千公尺以上的雪山草原，从没有放下手中的武器——铁锤、钢钎、铁锹和洋镐，发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，以高度的劳动热情和智慧，惊人的毅力和顽强的战斗意志，战胜了一切大自然所给予他们的困难，排除了前进大路上的所有障碍。他们斩断了整个横断山脉，劈开了昆仑山、唐古拉山、雀儿山，征服了千里无人烟的青海草原，通过了通天河，战胜了怒江天险……。为了支援西藏人民，为了建设边疆，他们说：山再高没有我们的意志高，石再硬没有我们骨头硬。只有征服草原，才能开发草原。数年来，据统计，仅康藏公路，共作土、石方工程两千多万立方，架设桥梁总长六千多公尺，修筑涵洞三千六百多道，越过了拔海三千到五千公尺以上的十多座大山，跨过了大渡河、雅砻江、金沙江、澜沧江、怒江和拉萨河等十多条有名的河流。在完成如此艰巨的筑路工程中，祖国各地尤其是西南、西北各地汉、藏、苗、回、蒙、哈萨克等各族人民给予粮食、物资、器材、工具以及人力、物力和运输等各方面的大力援助。生长在伟大的毛泽东时代的人民，就是这样的亲密团结，互助合作，用自己的劳动和智慧来共同建设祖国的大家庭，建设祖国的边疆，缔造自己的幸福。
    西藏民族是勇敢的、勤劳的，西藏地方的出产和蕴藏是丰富的。在辽阔的藏北高原上，是一片天然的牧场，盛产世界驰名的西藏羊毛、大宗的皮革、酥油和奶酪，以及珍贵的虫草、鹿茸和麝香等。在雅鲁藏布江流域和拉萨平原，又为富庶的农业区，盛产青稞、小麦和豌豆。原始森林，有的绵亘数百里。地下矿藏已发现的便有蕴藏量相当丰富的金、银、煤、铁、湖盐和硼砂等。但是由于近百年来帝国主义的侵略和历代反动统治的歧视和压迫，加以交通不便，自然地理条件等限制，这些丰富的地下宝藏，长久未能得到开采，大宗的土产特产不能得到很好的发展，因而促成西藏民族长期陷于贫困的境地。
    康藏、青藏两大公路干线通车后，康藏公路沿线的甘孜、德格、昌都、松宗、太昭等城市，已建立起银行、电讯局、国营贸易公司等，商业日趋繁荣，人口日益增多。沿线也出现了新建的城镇，如新路海、札木等地和许多“草原之家”。在藏北高原，通天河畔，亦已出现了国营贸易小组，运去内地廉价的日用必需品供给牧区人民，为牧区的土产特产找寻销路。公路通车拉萨后，昌都到拉萨的运价，即降低了百分之二十八。当然这些还仅仅是开始，今后在逐步发展西藏的农牧工商业、改善人民生活的既定的方针下，必将更有组织、有计划的发展西藏地区的经济，加强物资交流，发展土产特产，建立地方工业，使广大人民生活得到改善。
    康藏、青藏公路的通车，为西藏民族发展政治、经济和文化建设事业创造了更加有利的条件，繁荣幸福的新西藏的远景已逐渐出现在我们的眼前。但是我们也不能忽视西藏地区的自然地理条件，不能离开西藏民族当前所处的历史发展阶段。必须正确认识，要帮助西藏民族消灭现存的事实上的不平等，跻于先进民族之列，绝不是一朝一夕可以完成的。我们必须遵照和平解放西藏办法的协议所规定的“依据西藏的实际情况”，遵循宪法中所规定的“国家在经济建设和文化建设的过程中将照顾各民族的需要，而在社会主义改造的问题上将充分注意各民族发展的特点。”如刘少奇同志在宪法草案的报告中所说的：“在这一切问题上，应当容许各民族人民群众以及在各民族中同人民群众有联系的公众领袖们从容考虑，并按照他们的意愿去作决定。”“可以用更多的时间和更缓和的方式逐步地去实现”。
    进藏的中国人民解放军和工作人员，数年来在中国共产党、中央人民政府和伟大的领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在全国人民特别是藏族人民的大力支援下，同西藏人民亲密地团结在一起，正确地执行了民族政策、宗教政策，辛勤工作，帮助西藏人民进行建设，取得了西藏各阶层僧俗人民的爱戴和信任。但这仅是一个良好的开端。今后随着两大公路干线的通车，摆在我们面前的建设边疆——西藏的任务将更为艰苦和繁重。我们必须在现有的胜利基础上，更好地加强民族团结，忠实地执行和平协议，学习筑路部队的艰苦奋斗、战胜自然的精神，发扬爱国主义的精神，全心全意为人民服务，为祖国社会主义建设、为建设祖国边疆、为建设新的西藏而奋斗到底。
