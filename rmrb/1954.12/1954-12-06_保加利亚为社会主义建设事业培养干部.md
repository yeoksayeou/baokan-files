Bulgaria Cultivates Cadres for Socialist Construction
By Robin Avramov, Minister of Culture of the People's Republic of Bulgaria

    Under the leadership of the glorious Bulgarian Communist Party and with the great selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, the Bulgarian people are victoriously building socialism in their country. In a very short period of time, Bulgaria has transformed from a backward agricultural country dependent on imperialist countries into an industrial-agricultural country free from imperialist shackles.
    Industry, agriculture, and transportation could not have achieved such rapid development without a sufficient number of cadres – cadres with university degrees, skilled and unskilled agricultural cadres, and cadres in other fields.
    The Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Government pay special attention to the development of education and science, to the cultivation of cadres for socialist construction, and allocate large amounts of funds for this purpose. Comparing this concern with the work done by the former fascist government in higher education, science, and culture, the degree and significance of this concern can be clearly assessed. In 1939, the appropriations for the Academy of Sciences, higher education, art, and cultural undertakings were 49,246,000 leva (Bulgarian currency). In 1953, the appropriations for the same purposes reached 6,172.2 million leva (calculated at comparable prices), an increase of more than 120 times. The appropriations for ordinary school education in 1953 increased by 15 times compared to 1939.
    In the past ten years, higher education has greatly developed and undergone fundamental reforms. During the fascist autocratic era, Bulgaria had only five institutions of higher learning with approximately 9,800 students. Today, we have twenty institutions of higher learning with 33,000 college students including correspondence students. Before September 9, 1944, the bourgeois rulers used education to serve their own class, exploiters, and anti-people purposes. At that time, the most developed department was the law department of Sofia University, which trained thousands of judges, lawyers, and functionaries, many of whom served the bourgeoisie in interrogating and deceiving the working people. Now, the faculties, departments, and specializations of institutions of higher learning are training experts needed for the national economy and socialist industry and agriculture. They are all serving the people. The People's Republic of Bulgaria has four higher technical schools, four higher agricultural schools, three economic colleges, three art colleges, two medical colleges, and other colleges. Approximately 5,000 young and loyal builders of socialism graduate from these institutions of higher learning every year. These engineers, agronomists, livestock breeders, veterinarians, economists, doctors, and teachers are all enthusiastic patriots of our motherland and loyal friends of the great Soviet Union. Before September 9, 1944, it was difficult to find a university-educated expert in the countryside. Now, all the larger villages have their own doctors, agronomists, and veterinarians.
    The social composition of the students has also changed. Today, many children of the working people are studying in universities or colleges. Approximately 20 percent of all students are industrial workers or their children.
    The People's Government guarantees the necessary conditions for the further development of higher education and provides support to students. Sofia University is a huge building with various modern facilities. It is the pride of our country. Spacious buildings for several newly built higher technical schools have been constructed, with many auditoriums and well-equipped laboratories. The new campus of the Higher Drama School is also under construction.
    The fascist rulers never allocated any funds for scholarships, nor did they build a single state-owned student dormitory. Today, the state allocates scholarships to more than 14,000 students and has opened thousands of student dormitories.
    The teaching principles, systems, and teaching methods in higher education have undergone fundamental reforms. Students are educated according to teaching plans and syllabuses, which ensures the training of outstanding cadres loyal to the people and the cause of socialism. The vast majority of textbooks, original or translated, are based on modern progressive science, especially the achievements of Soviet science. In order to implement the resolutions passed at the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party held at the end of February and beginning of March this year, higher education is more closely linking science with the practice of socialist construction. Institutions of higher learning are continuing to wage the following struggles: eliminating the remnants of bourgeois ideology; further improving the teaching of Marxism-Leninism by raising the level of lectures and seminars and correcting dogmatic and objectivist teaching methods; striving for the complete victory of advanced science and Marxist-Leninist thought; raising the level of students; and advancing communist education. We have done a great deal of work in improving the education syllabus and textbooks and publishing new textbooks based on the latest scientific achievements. In the past four years, more than 600 kinds of textbooks have been published for higher education. Our task is to publish the textbooks needed for the basic courses of higher education in the near future.
    Our young republic spares no effort in training new cadres in music, drama, and other arts.
    Our country currently has three higher art colleges - the Conservatory of Music, the Academy of Fine Arts, the Higher Institute of Dramatic Arts - and many secondary and primary art schools. The higher art colleges alone have more than 1,300 male and female students studying there.
    The People's Government pays special attention to the training of art cadres, which is not only reflected in the increase in the number of students, but also in the recognized achievements of young Bulgarian artists and musicians in international festival competitions. At the Third World Youth Festival in Berlin, Bulgarian actors won thirteen prizes, and at the Fourth World Youth Festival in Bucharest, they won thirty-seven prizes.
    In order to train technical cadres, the Party and the government have established sufficient secondary vocational schools.
    Before September 9, 1944, there were a total of 7,000 students in higher vocational schools, most of whom were studying tailoring, carpentry, or business, home economics, and other courses. Most of these schools were private, and the state generally rarely intervened in the employment of graduates, who had to find their own way out.
    Currently, all technical specialized schools are state-owned. Approximately 55,000 male and female students are studying there, many of whom receive state scholarships and live in student dormitories. Higher vocational schools have undergone fundamental adjustments. Some old and unsuitable ones have been closed. New schools, such as mining, machine manufacturing, electrical engineering, chemical industry, and agricultural technology schools, which train cadres for the food industry and other departments, have been established on the old sites.
    In the past, students in technical schools had almost no textbooks, and their work was greatly hindered. Now, the People's Government has supplied them with textbooks. More than 520 kinds of textbooks have been printed for technical schools.
    In addition, technical night schools have been opened for industrial workers. More than 4,000 workers are studying in night schools.
    Every year, 12,000 male and female students graduate from technical schools.
    The faculty members of Bulgarian technical schools are working hard to expand production internships, improve teaching plans and syllabuses, and ensure the printing of new textbooks, improve lectures and teaching methods for students, and connect their work with practice.
    A network of labor reserve schools for training skilled workers for industry, construction, and transportation has been established. These schools are based on the principles of Soviet labor reserve vocational schools. Students studying here are fully cared for by the state. Their study period is two years. In addition to these schools, there are also six-month or ten-month training courses suitable for young students who have completed the eighth-grade curriculum. In order to conduct good technical training, labor reserve schools have well-equipped workshops to facilitate internships. In addition, students also undergo a period of production internship in various industrial enterprises. In the 1951-52 academic year, our country's 44 reserve schools and three classes trained 2,150 skilled workers for the national economy. In the 1953-54 academic year, the number of these schools reached 94, with a total of 24 classes, and the number of graduates was 6,900. Labor reserve schools have completed their tasks. These schools have trained the skilled workers needed by various enterprises. Many students who have graduated from labor reserve schools have become Stakhanovite workers and rationalization proposers.
    In addition to technical schools, labor reserve schools, and classes, government departments also organize various training courses for workers engaged in production and workers temporarily detached from production. Thousands of workers, peasants, and staff members improve their skills in these training courses.
    Through university education, technical schools, labor reserve schools, and various training courses, Bulgaria has obtained cadres with university degrees, skilled and unskilled cadres needed for the national economy, state organs, and cultural life.
    The Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries have given great help to our country in training cadres for socialist construction.
    Every year, our country sends hundreds of young men and women to the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries to study or do postgraduate work. They study in departments that our country's higher education does not yet have. After returning home, they contribute their strength and knowledge to serve the people. Many young students have also been sent to the People's Republic of China to study.
    The faculty members of Bulgarian universities, colleges, and technical schools are redoubling their efforts to improve the work of training cadres for socialist construction, in accordance with the instructions of the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party.

    保加利亚为社会主义建设事业培养干部
    保加利亚人民共和国文化部部长  罗宾·阿夫拉莫夫
    保加利亚人民在光荣的保加利亚共产党领导下和伟大苏联的巨大无私援助下，正在自己的国家里胜利地建设着社会主义。在极短的时期内，保加利亚已从一个依附于帝国主义国家的落后的农业国，变成了摆脱帝国主义羁绊的工业—农业国了。
    如果没有足够数量的干部——具有大学程度的、技术上熟练和不熟练的农业的以及其他方面的干部，工业、农业和运输业是不可能获得如此迅速的发展的。
    保加利亚共产党和人民政府特别关怀教育和科学的发展，关怀建设社会主义的干部的培养，并为此而拨出大批款项。同过去法西斯政府在高等教育、科学和文化方面所做的工作对比一下，这种关怀的程度和意义就可清楚地估量出来了。一九三九年，对科学院、高等教育、艺术和文化事业方面的拨款是四千九百二十四万六千利瓦（保币）。一九五三年用于同样目的的拨款达到了六十一亿七千二百余万利瓦（按比较价格计算），增加了一百二十倍多。一九五三年对普通学校教育的拨款已比一九三九年增加了十五倍。
    十年来，高等教育有了极大的发展并且得到了根本的改革。在法西斯专制时代，保加利亚只有五所高等学校约九千八百个学生。今天，我们已有二十所高等学校和包括函授班学生在内的三万三千名大学生。一九四四年九月九日以前，资产阶级统治者利用教育为自己的阶级、剥削者和反人民的目的服务。那时最发达的科系是索非亚大学的法律系，那里训练了数千名法官、律师和机关工作者，其中许多是效劳于资产阶级对劳动人民进行审讯和欺骗的。现在，高等学校的各院、系和专科都在培养着为国民经济和社会主义工业与农业所需要的专家。他们都是为人民服务的。保加利亚人民共和国已有四个高等技术学校，四个高等农业学校，三个经济学院，三个艺术学院，两个医学院以及其他学院。每年大约有五千个年轻而忠诚的社会主义建设者由这些高等学校毕业。这些工程师、农艺家、牲畜饲养家、兽医、经济学家、医生和教师都是我们祖国的热忱爱国者，是伟大苏联的忠实朋友。一九四四年九月九日以前，很难在乡间找到一个受过大学教育的专家。现在，所有较大的村庄里，都有了它们自己的医生、农艺学家和兽医了。
    学生的社会成分也有了改变。今天，许多劳动人民的子女都在大学或高等学校中学习着。全体学生中大约有百分之二十是产业工人或是他们的子女。
    人民政府保证进一步发展高等教育的必要条件，并给学生以支持。索非亚大学是一座有着各种现代化设备的巨大建筑。它是我国的骄傲。已经新建了几所高等技术学校的宽敞的大楼，这些建筑拥有许多礼堂和设备完善的实验室。高等戏剧学校的新校舍也正在兴建中。
    法西斯统治者从来没有拨过任何款项作为助学金，也从没有修建过一幢国有的学生宿舍。今天，国家为一万四千多个学生拨付了奖学金，并且开办了成千所学生宿舍。
    高等教育中的教学原则、制度和教学法，已经过了根本的改革。学生们是按着教学计划和教学大纲而受到教育的，这样就能保证培养出忠实于人民和社会主义事业的优秀干部。绝大部分教科书，原著的或经过翻译的，都是以现代进步科学，尤其是以苏联科学的成就为依据的。为实现今年二月底和三月初举行的保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会通过的决议，高等教育更紧密地把科学与社会主义建设的实践联结起来。各高等学校正继续进行着如下的斗争：肃清资产阶级思想残余；从提高讲课与习明纳尔的水平和纠正教条主义与客观主义的教学方法来进一步改进马克思列宁主义的教学工作；争取先进科学与马克思列宁主义思想的彻底胜利；提高学生的程度；以及向前推进共产主义教育。在改进教育大纲和教科书以及在最新的科学成就基础上出版新教科书方面，我们已作了很多工作。最近四年来，已为高等教育出版了六百多种教科书。我们的任务是必须在最近将来出版高等教育各基本课程所需要的教科书。
    我们年轻的共和国不遗余力地在音乐、戏剧和其他艺术方面培养新的干部。
    我国目前共有三所高等艺术学院——音乐学院、艺术学院、高等戏剧学校以及许多中等和初等的艺术学校。只高等艺术学院，就有一千三百多个男女学生在那里学习。
    人民政府特别关怀培养艺术干部，这不仅表现于学生人数的增加，而且也可以从保加利亚青年艺术家和音乐家在国际性的节日竞赛中所获得的公认的成绩得到说明。在柏林举行的第三届世界青年联欢节上，保加利亚的演员获得了十三项奖品，在布加勒斯特举行的第四届世界青年联欢节上，获得了三十七项奖品。
    为了培养技术干部，党和政府开办了足够的中等职业学校。
      一九四四年九月九日以前，高等职业学校中共有七千名学生，其中大多数是学裁缝、木工或经商、家政和其他课程的。这些学校大部分是私立的，国家一般地很少过问毕业生的就业问题，学生必须自找出路。
    目前，所有的技术专科学校都是国立的。大约有五万五千名男女学生在那里学习，其中许多人接受国家的助学金并且住在学生宿舍里。高等职业学校已经经过了基本调整。有些旧的不适用的都已停办。新的，如为食品工业和其他部门培养干部的采矿、机器制造、电气技术、化学工业和农业技术学校在旧校址上开办起来了。
    过去，技术学校的学生几乎没有教科书，工作受到很大的阻碍。现在，人民政府已为他们供应了教科书。供技术学校用的教科书已经刊印了五百二
  十多种。
    此外，还为产业工人们开办了技术夜校。四千
  多个工人在夜校中学习着。
    每年都有一万二千名男女学生从技术学校毕业。
    保加利亚的技术学校的教职员努力从事于扩大生产实习、改进教学计划和大纲以及保证新教科书的印行、改进对学生的讲课及教学方法，使自己的工作联系实际。
    为工业、建筑业和运输部门培养熟练工人的劳动后备学校网，已经建立起来了。这种学校是以苏联劳动后备职业学校的原则为根据的。在这里学习的学生们，受到国家的充分照顾。他们的学习时间是两年。除了这些学校外，还有适合于读完八年级课程的青年学生的六个月或十个月的训练班。为了进行良好的技术训练，劳动后备学校都拥有设备齐全的工场，以便于实习。此外，学生们还要在各工业企业中经历一个时期的生产实习。在一九五一—五二学年中，我国的四十四个后备学校和三个班，为国民经济培养了二千一百五十个熟练工人。在一九五三—五四学年中，这些学校的数目达到了九十四个，共有二十四个班级，毕业生的数目为六千九百人。劳动后备学校已经完成了它们的任务。这些学校培养了为各企业所需要的熟练工人。很多从劳动后备学校毕业的学生，成了斯大哈诺夫工作者和合理化建议者。
    除了技术学校、劳动后备学校和班级以外，政府各部门还为从事生产的工人和暂时脱离生产的工人组织了各种训练班。成千的工人、农民和职员在这些训练班里提高他们的技术。
    通过大学教育、技术学校和劳动后备学校以及各种训练班，保加利亚获得了国民经济、国家机关和文化生活所需要的具有大学程度的、熟练和不熟练的干部。
    苏联和各人民民主国家对我国培养社会主义建设的干部给了很大的帮助。
    我国每年都要派数百名男女青年到苏联和人民民主国家去留学或作研究生。他们在我国高等教育还没有具备的科系中学习。他们回国后，就贡献自己的力量与知识为人民服务。许多青年学生也被派到中华人民共和国去学习。
    保加利亚大学、高等学校和技术学校的教职员们正遵照着保加利亚共产党第六次代表大会的指示，加倍地努力于改进为社会主义建设培养干部的工作。
