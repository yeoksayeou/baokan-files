    Large-Scale Export of Canned Foods
    The meat and fruit canned goods produced in 1954 by the Shanghai Yimin Food Factory No. 1, Food Factory No. 2, Food Factory No. 3 under the Ministry of Light Industry, and the local state-owned Dalian Canned Food Factory, Harbin Canned Food Factory, Tianjin Canned Food Factory, and Shantou Canned Food Factory have been exported in large quantities. It is estimated that the total national export volume this year will reach more than 11,600 tons, which is 165 percent of the highest export volume of canned food before liberation. Among the exported canned goods are Shantou's pineapples, lychees, and tangerines, Dalian's apricots and strawberries, and Zhejiang's loquats.
    The large-scale export of canned food has earned a lot of foreign exchange for the country, which has been used to exchange for industrial equipment, directly supporting industrial construction. One ton of canned meat can be exchanged for nine tons of steel; five and a half tons of canned beef can be exchanged for a tractor; only two-thirds of the total value of canned food exported this year is needed to buy all the equipment for a sugar factory with an annual output of 54,000 tons of sugar.
    The quality of canned food produced in our country has been rapidly improved. At present, exported canned food can generally be free of impurities, free of bacteria, delicious, and beautifully packaged. The commodity inspection bureaus in various places are also very serious about the inspection of exported canned food.

    食品罐头大量出口
    轻工业部所属上海益民食品一厂、食品二厂、食品三厂及地方国营旅大罐头厂、哈尔滨罐头厂、天津罐头厂、汕头罐头厂一九五四年生产的肉类、水果罐头，已能大量出口。预计今年全国出口总数达一万一千六百余吨，为解放前罐头最高出口量的百分之一六五。出口的罐头中有汕头的菠萝、荔枝、桔柑，旅大地区的杏桃、草梅，浙江出产的枇杷等。
    罐头的大量出口，为国家换回了很多外汇，换回了工业器材，直接支援了工业建设。一吨肉类罐头，可以换回九吨钢材；五吨半牛肉罐头可换回一台拖拉机；只要用今年出口罐头总值的三分之二，就可以买回一个年产五万四千吨食糖的糖厂的全部设备。
    我国出产的罐头质量已迅速提高，目前出口罐头一般能做到不含杂质，没有病菌，味美适口，包装美观。各地商品检验局对出口罐头的检验也很认真。
