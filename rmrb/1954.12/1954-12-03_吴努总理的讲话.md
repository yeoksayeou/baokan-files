Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee Mr. Liu Shaoqi, Ladies and Gentlemen:

	I would like to express my gratitude to Prime Minister Zhou Enlai on behalf of my delegation and in my own name for his warm welcome to us. Before I came to the People's Republic of China, I was deeply convinced that I would have the honor of receiving a warm welcome here. Please allow me to offer some explanation in this regard. Before Prime Minister Zhou Enlai came to Rangoon, I did not know what attitude I should take towards our distinguished guest. My government officials also did not know. We felt uneasy, unsure whether we were going to receive a difficult person, a proud person, or a person with a bad temper. But after he arrived in Rangoon and met with us, we immediately found that our worries were completely unfounded, because from his relationship with us, it could be seen that his demeanor showed that he was not only the Prime Minister of a powerful country, but also the Prime Minister of a brotherly country.

	Since that moment, we have been completely convinced that if a Prime Minister is so humble and so loving when dealing with a small country, then the people in his country will be even more generous and hospitable! So, as soon as I received his invitation to visit his country before the end of the year, I immediately decided to accept this kind invitation, even though I am very afraid of the extremely cold weather. That is why my wife and I are here in Beijing at this moment. Under normal circumstances, such a visit would be impossible. Because our Chinese friends must know that Burma is a hot country—a very hot country. In all three seasons—summer, rainy season, and winter—people sweat non-stop. I have seen His Excellency Prime Minister Zhou Enlai still sweating profusely even while constantly fanning himself. Our visit to an extremely cold country in a very cold season clearly demonstrates our goodwill and sincerity towards Chairman Mao, Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, and the people of this country. Please allow me, on behalf of the Government and people of the Union of Burma and the members of my delegation, to once again express my gratitude for the warm welcome given to us.

	Prime Minister Zhou Enlai just said that Burma was the first Asian country to recognize the People's Republic of China. I would like to take this opportunity to affirm that I want to express, in my own name and on behalf of the government that I have the honor to lead, that we are extremely proud to be the first country to recognize the People's Republic of China. Prime Minister Zhou also praised the moral perfection of our country. Indeed, to tell the truth, I am very proud of this praise. We have always valued moral perfection more than anything else. Friendly relations, unity, and progress between countries mainly rely on moral perfection. Without this quality, international understanding is impossible to achieve. Just having lip service without sincerity cannot accomplish anything. Any country whose leaders lack moral perfection will head towards destruction. Your greatest enemy, Chiang Kai-shek, and his gang had to flee to Taiwan because they completely lacked this moral perfection. Therefore, I am convinced that no matter how hard they try to set foot on this land, they will never be able to do so.

	The People's Republic of China has shown with its actions that it has deep goodwill, concern, and brotherly friendship towards our country. Let me take this opportunity to give some examples to illustrate my point.

	Quite a few Kuomintang elements are carrying out looting in our territory. If the People's Republic of China did not treat our country so amicably, it would cause us great harm. I told Chairman Mao yesterday how much the situation would deteriorate if the People's Republic of China took a different attitude. In that case, Burma would very likely become Korea II or Indochina II. However, because the People's Republic of China loves our country, it has adopted a very sympathetic attitude towards us on the Kuomintang issue. The People's Republic of China has even expressed its understanding of our situation several times.

	Another example—an example in the aspect of purchasing rice. Our country has a considerable surplus of rice. If there were no buyers, we would be in a difficult situation. At the same time, due to the destruction caused by the war, the economic situation in our country is very unsatisfactory. The success of our reconstruction and administrative work depends entirely on the sale of rice. If rice cannot be sold, it is likely to shake the foundation of the entire national economy. In this regard, your great country agreed to purchase 150,000 tons of our rice—rice worth approximately six million pounds or more than eighty million Burmese kyats. I believe that this generous gesture is a proof of friendship towards our country. For this reason, I immediately expressed the gratitude of the Federal Government to you—Mr. Prime Minister—after the rice agreement was signed. In addition, I have publicly declared on our National Day how grateful we are to the government and people of your great country for their friendly approach to our rice issue and for your sympathy expressed on the Kuomintang issue.

	Mr. Prime Minister, you just made some remarks on peaceful coexistence. Your speech was indeed very appropriate. Countries with different political ideologies are able to coexist peacefully. The People's Republic of China believes in communism, while the Union of Burma does not believe in it. Although our two countries differ in political ideology, their deep desire to help each other in times of need with goodwill, friendship, and mutual concern has been demonstrated in the purchase of rice and in our treatment of the Kuomintang issue. From this, it can be clearly seen that countries with different political ideologies are able to coexist peacefully and amicably.

	Burma and China not only maintain the most friendly relations today, but have always maintained the most friendly relations throughout their long history. Both sides have always striven to establish closer relations, and there is a long tradition of friendship between the two countries.

	Since the beginning of history, there have been friendly relations between the two countries, and they have helped each other in times of trouble. When problems arise between the two countries, they resolve them amicably. I believe that this tradition of mutual friendship is a characteristic of our Eastern civilization. As long as we firmly remember this aspect of our relationship and adopt a good-neighborly attitude, I am convinced that our two countries are a force for promoting world peace.

	I would like to recount some examples from our country's history to prove that my statement that there is a long tradition of friendship between our two countries is not wrong.

	The people of the Union of Burma originated in Central Asia. Buddhism was introduced to our country in the first century AD. At the beginning of history, our ancestors lived in several parts of our country, and small independent kingdoms emerged. It was not until the eleventh century AD that King Anawrahta and King Kyanzittha were able to unify the different groups and achieve a single kingdom with an area similar to that of the present Union of Burma. This was the first time that an autonomous and independent Burma appeared in Southeast Asia, and from then on, Burma established direct contact with China, a large country. With the arrival of the evil system of imperialism, we lost the opportunity to have direct political contact with China in the past sixty years. But after we fought imperialism with our own blood, sweat, and tears, we were able to re-establish our traditional friendship with China, a large country.

	This period of Sino-Burmese friendship lasted almost a thousand years, from the time of Anawrahta and Kyanzittha until the time of our last Burmese king, Thibaw. During this long period of a thousand years, Burma and China only resorted to force twice to resolve their problems. It is worth pointing out that on both occasions, China was not ruled by its own native kings, but by foreign warlords, and the thing that these warlords seemed to be fascinated with was expanding territory.

	The first time was in the thirteenth century when the imperialist Mongols—Tartars—occupied Western and Eastern Europe. Their leaders, Genghis Khan and Kublai Khan, were indeed terrible imperialists who advocated expanding territory. These warlords occupied Russia and China. After they established sovereignty in China, they turned to attack neighboring countries, including Burma. But after the regime of the Mongol warlords ended and China was once again under the rule of its own native Ming Dynasty emperors, normal peaceful relations between Burma and China were restored.

	The second and last armed conflict occurred in the eighteenth century, when China was under the rule of the Manchu emperors who had occupied China a century earlier. The Burmese king at that time, after ruling the entire country, had to fight three wars with them; but when China was infiltrated by European imperialists and both the Manchu and Burmese emperors hoped for peace, peace was restored. These facts are recorded in detail in world history.

	I have elaborated on all these facts not because I want to emphasize these conflicts, but because I want to clearly illustrate the fact that in a thousand years, China and Burma only fought two wars, and on both occasions, China was under the rule of foreign warlords who advocated expanding territory.

	When China was ruled by its own native emperors, people saw that there were peaceful relations between our two countries. To reiterate our past history: King Anawrahta and King Kyanzittha unified the country in the eleventh century. At that time, China was under the rule of its own native Song Dynasty emperors. Our annals say that King Kyanzittha established friendly relations with the Song Dynasty emperors. Of course, at that time, Burma had close cultural and economic contact with India. Because King Kyanzittha wanted to establish the most friendly relations with China like with India, he sent two Burmese missions to China one after another. China received these two missions very warmly, and the result was that trade between the two countries expanded.

	According to our historical records, Bagan, and indeed the whole of Burma, became prosperous since the reign of King Kyanzittha. Since then, Buddhism has shone like the sun and the moon. There followed a long period of peace and prosperity, and the people enjoyed true happiness. Great progress was made in education and culture, and extremely magnificent pagodas and shrines were built under King Kyanzittha. In ancient Bagan, religious buildings of that time can still be seen, and they are preserved in extremely good condition. The pagodas of Bagan clearly demonstrate the peaceful, civilized state of Bagan society for about two hundred years, starting with King Kyanzittha.

	Why was the Kingdom of Bagan able to enjoy a long period of peace? The answer is not difficult to find. Obviously, the reason for this golden age was mainly because there were not only friendly relations between Burma and India, but also friendly relations between Burma and China.

	From the time of Kyanzittha, Burma enjoyed uninterrupted peace for almost two hundred years. I said earlier that peace was only interrupted when the great neighbor China was ruled by foreign Mongol emperors. But when China was restored by the Ming Dynasty, peace once again descended upon China and Burma. For a period of six hundred years, China and Burma maintained the most friendly relations, and it was only in the eighteenth century that the Qing Dynasty emperors of China and the King of Burma fought a war. After the war ended, peace was restored once again and maintained for almost a hundred years, until the time of Thibaw, our last Burmese king.

	Among the Burmese kings who contributed to maintaining peaceful relations between China and Burma, King Bodawpaya should be mentioned in particular. Of course, during his reign, as during the reign of King Kyanzittha, Burma established close cultural and economic relations with India. King Bodawpaya followed in the footsteps of King Kyanzittha and established friendly ties with China. During his reign, five Chinese goodwill missions were warmly received in Amarapura. On the other hand, King Bodawpaya also sent four Burmese goodwill missions to Beijing. Of course, this practice of exchanging missions greatly promoted the resolution of any issues of common concern. In addition to exchanging gifts and exchanging prisoners, border issues were also discussed and resolved amicably.

	According to Burmese historical records, during the reign of King Bodawpaya, Burma experienced a revival in religious, educational, cultural, and social activities. Buddhism developed unprecedentedly. Medicine and astronomy also developed greatly, and peace descended everywhere. The reason for this golden age was that not only peaceful and friendly relations were established between Burma and India, but also peaceful and friendly relations were established between Burma and China.

	If we follow the examples set by King Kyanzittha and King Bodawpaya, as well as the Indian and Chinese kings of their time, in pursuing our foreign policy, we will certainly be able to enjoy peace as in the days of those enlightened kings. The peace in this part of the world will be a great force for promoting world peace.

	You undoubtedly know that in June this year, the Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China visited Burma at our invitation. You also know that after a free and frank exchange of views between us, China and Burma unanimously agreed on the following five principles to guide relations between the two countries:

	(1) Mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty
	(2) Mutual non-aggression
	(3) Mutual non-interference in internal affairs
	(4) Equality and Mutual Benefit
	(5) Peaceful Coexistence

	These five principles of peace are very significant not only for our two countries but also for world peace. Whether in terms of practical benefit or justice, these five principles are appropriate guiding principles for all countries. Because our two countries have unanimously agreed on these five principles, I am convinced that peaceful coexistence is guaranteed. History proves that thanks to the efforts of kings like Kyanzittha and Bodawpaya, China and Burma were able to coexist peacefully. Now let us also build a region of peaceful coexistence based on the five principles that your distinguished Prime Minister and I have unanimously agreed upon.

	I propose a toast to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China, General Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Standing Committee, and Prime Minister Zhou Enlai.

### 吴努总理的讲话

1954-12-03
第1版()
专栏：

    吴努总理的讲话周恩来总理，朱德副主席，常务委员会委员长刘少奇先生阁下，女士们和先生们：
    我愿代表我的代表团团员和以我个人的名义首先向周恩来总理表示谢意，感谢他对我们的热烈欢迎。在我没有来到中华人民共和国以前，我就深信我将有幸在这里受到热烈的欢迎。请让我在这方面作一些解释。在周恩来总理没有到仰光以前，我不知道我应当对我们的贵宾采取什么态度。我的政府人员也不知道。我们感到不安，不知道我们是不是要接待一位难对付的人、一位骄傲的人或者一位脾气暴躁的人。但是在他到达仰光同我们会面以后，我们立即发现我们的担心是完全没有根据的，因为从他同我们的关系中可以看出，他的举止表明他不但是一个强国的总理，而且是一个兄弟国家的总理。
    自从那个时刻以后，我们完完全全相信：如果一位总理在对待一个小国时竟然如此谦虚和如此友爱，那么他的国家里的人民将会更加慷慨和好客得多！所以在我一接到他要我在年底以前访问他的国家的邀请时，我立即就决定接受这一善意的邀请，虽然我是非常怕极其寒冷的天气的。这就是我的妻子和我此刻来到北京的缘由。在平常，作这样一次访问会是一件不可能的事。因为我们的中国朋友们一定知道，缅甸是一个炎热的国家——一个非常炎热的国家。在所有三个季节中——夏季、雨季和冬季——人们都不停地流汗。我曾经看到周恩来总理阁下在不停地挥扇的情况下还是汗流浃背。我们这次在一个很寒冷的季节访问一个极寒冷的国家，清楚地表明我们对毛主席、周恩来总理和这个国家的人民的亲善和诚意。请允许我代表缅甸联邦政府和人民和我的代表团的团员再一次对给予我们的热诚欢迎表示感谢。
    周恩来总理刚刚说缅甸是第一个承认中华人民共和国的亚洲国家。我想趁这个机会肯定地说，我要以我自己的名义和代表我有幸所领导的政府表示，我们因作为第一个承认中华人民共和国的国家而感到极大的骄傲。周总理也对我们国家在道义上的完美表示赞许。的确，说老实话，我很为这种称赞而感到自豪。我们一向对道义上的完美比任何其他事情都更重视。国家间的友好关系、团结和进步主要依靠道义上的完美。没有这种特质，国际间的谅解是不可能达成的。单是有口惠而无诚意，是什么事情也达不成的。任何国家只要他的领导者缺乏道义上的完美，就会走向毁灭。你们最大的敌人蒋介石和他的匪帮所以不得不逃到台湾，就是因为他们完全缺乏这种道义上的完美。因此，我确信，无论他们怎样竭力想登上这块土地，他们是永远办不到的。
    中华人民共和国已用行动来表明它对我们国家是有着深厚的善意、关注和兄弟之谊的。让我趁这个机会举一些例子来说明我的看法。
    有相当多的国民党分子正在我们国土上进行抢劫。如果中华人民共和国不是非常友善地对待我国，那一定会使我们遭到很大的损害。我昨天已经对毛主席说过，如果中华人民共和国采取一种不同的态度，局势会恶化到什么程度。那样一来，缅甸就很可能成为朝鲜第二或者印度支那第二。但是中华人民共和国由于爱护我国，在国民党问题上对我们采取了一种非常富有同情心的态度。中华人民共和国甚至几次表示了解我们的处境。
    还有一个例子——购买大米方面的一个例子。我国有相当多的剩余大米。如果没有买主，我们将会陷入窘境，同时，由于战争破坏的结果，我国的经济状况是很不能令人满意的。我们的复兴和行政工作的成功完全取决于大米的销售。如果不能出售大米，那很可能会使整个国民经济的基础动摇。在这方面，你们伟大的国家同意购买我们十五万吨大米——价值达约六百万英镑或八千多万缅元的大米。我认为这种慷慨的做法是对我国友好的一种证明。为此，我在大米协定签订以后立即向您——总理先生——表达联邦政府的谢意。此外，我在我们的国庆节已经公开宣称，我们是多么感谢你们伟大的国家的政府和人民在对待我们的大米问题上的友好做法和你们在国民党问题上表示的同情。
    总理先生，您刚才就和平共处发表了一些看法。您的发言确实是十分适当的。具有不同的政治观念形态的国家是能够和平地共同相处。中华人民共和国信仰共产主义，而缅甸联邦并不信仰它。虽然我们两国在政治观念形态上有所不同，但是它们在需要的时候以善意、友谊和互相关心的精神彼此帮助的深切愿望在购买大米以及在我们对待国民党问题上得到了证明。从这里，可以清楚地看到：具有不同政治观念形态的国家是能够和平友好地相处的。
    缅甸和中国不仅在今天保持着最友好的关系，而且在它们的悠久的历史中始终保持最友好的关系。双方一向为建立更密切的关系而努力，两国之间存在着长久的友谊的传统。
    有史以来，两国之间就有着友好的关系，彼此在患难中相互给予援助。当两国之间发生问题的时候，它们和和气气地加以解决，我认为这种相互友好的传统是我们东方文明的特征。只要我们牢牢记住我们的关系的这个方面，采取善邻态度，我确信我们两国是一支促进世界和平的力量。
    我希望追述我国历史中的一些事例来证明我说我们两国之间存在着长久的友谊的传统的说法是不错的。
    缅甸联邦人民起源于中亚。佛教在公元一世纪时传到我国。在历史开始的时候，我们的先人居住在我国的几部分地区，小的独立的王国出现了。只是在公元十一世纪，安那诺塔王和基安西塔王才能够把不同的集团统一起来，实现一个幅员同现在的缅甸联邦差不多的单一的王国。这是一个自主独立的缅甸第一次出现于东南亚，从那时起，缅甸同中国这个大国建立了直接的联系。随着罪恶的帝国主义制度的到来，我们在过去六十年中失去了同中国发生直接的政治上的接触的机会。但是在我们用自己的血汗和泪水同帝国主义进行战斗以后，我们能够重新建立我们同中国这个大国的传统友谊。
    这个中缅友好时期，从安那诺塔和基安西塔时代起一直到我们缅甸的最后一个国王蒂保时代止，差不多历时一千年。在这一千年的漫长时期中，缅甸和中国只有两次采取武力来解决它们的问题。值得指出的是，在这两次，中国都不是受它自己本国的国王统治，而是受外国军阀统治，而这些军阀所迷恋的事情似乎是扩张领土。
    第一次是在十三世纪帝国主义的蒙古——鞑靼人占领西欧和东亚的时候。他们的领袖成吉思汗和忽必烈事实上是主张扩张领土的可怖的帝国主义者。这些军阀占领了俄国和中国。他们在中国建立了宗主权以后，就转而进攻邻国，其中包括缅甸。但是在蒙古军阀的政权结束，中国再度在它自己本国的明朝帝王的统治之下以后，缅甸和中国之间的正常的和平关系就恢复了。
    第二次也就是最后一次武装冲突发生在十八世纪，当时中国是在一个世纪以前占领中国的满洲帝王的统治之下。当时的缅甸国王在统治了全国之后，不得不同他们进行三次战争；但是当中国为欧洲帝国主义者渗入，满洲和缅甸帝王都希望和平的时候，和平恢复了。这些事实是在世界历史上是详细记载着的。
    我详述所有这些事实并不是因为我想强调这些冲突，而是因为我想清楚说明这样的事实：在一千年中，中国和缅甸之间只进行过两次战争，而当时中国都是在主张扩张领土的外国军阀统治之下的。
    当中国受它本国的帝王统治的时候，人们看到我们两国之间存在着和平的关系。再重述一下我们过去的历史：安那诺塔王和基安西塔王在十一世纪统一全国。当时中国受它本国的宋朝帝王统治。我们的史册说，基安西塔王同宋朝帝王建立了友好关系。当然，到那个时候，缅甸同印度有着密切的文化上和经济上的接触。由于基安西塔王要同中国建立像同印度一样的最友好的关系，他曾先后派遣两个缅甸使团到中国来。中国非常热烈地接待了这两个使团，结果是两国间的贸易扩大了。
    根据我们的史册记载，卜岸、实际上整个缅甸自从基安西塔王统治以后就变得繁荣起来。自那时以后，佛教也像太阳和月亮一样发出光明。接着有很长一段和平和繁荣的时期，人民享受着真正的幸福。在教育和文化方面获得了长足的进展，在基安西塔王治下，极其华美的宝塔和神龛建立了起来。在古老的卜岸，仍然可以看到那时候的宗教建筑，它们被保存得极其完善。卜岸的宝塔十分清楚地证明了卜岸社会从基安西塔王开始的历时约两百年的和平的、文明的状态。
    为什么卜岸王国能享受长时期的和平呢？答案是不难找到的。显然，其所以出现这个黄金时代，主要因为不但缅甸和印度之间存在着友好关系，而且在缅甸和中国之间也存在着友好关系。
    从基安西塔时代起，差不多有两百年的时间，缅甸享受了没有间断的和平。我先前已经说过，只有在伟大的邻邦中国被外国的蒙古帝王统治时，和平才遭到中断。但是，当中国为明朝所光复时，和平又一次降临到中国和缅甸。在一个长达六百年的时期，中国和缅甸保持最友好的关系，只是在十八世纪，中国的满清帝王和缅甸国王进行过战争。在战争结束后，和平又一次恢复了，并且保持了差不多一百年，一直到我们缅甸的最后的一个国王蒂保王时代。
    在对维持中国和缅甸之间的和平关系有过贡献的缅甸王中，应当特别提一提保道王。当然，在他统治期间，正如在基安西塔王统治期间一样，缅甸跟印度建立了密切的文化和经济关系。保道王步基安西塔王的后尘，跟中国建立了友好联系。在他统治期间，五个中国亲善使团在亚马拉不纳受到极热烈的接待。另一方面，保道王也派遣了四个缅甸亲善使团到北京。当然，这样互派使团的做法，大大促进了任何具有共同利害关系的问题的解决。除了交换礼物和交换犯人以外，边界问题也得到友好的讨论和解决。
    根据缅甸史册的记载，在保道王统治期间，缅甸在宗教、教育、文化和社会活动方面都有了复兴。佛教有了空前的发展。医学和天文学也有了很大的发展，和平降临到各地。所以出现这种太平盛世，是因为不仅缅甸和印度之间建立了和平友好关系，而且缅甸和中国之间也建立了和平友好关系。
    如果我们在奉行我们的外交政策方面遵循着基安西塔王和保道王以及和他们同时代的印度和中国国王所树立的范例，我们一定能像在那些英明的国王的时代一样享受和平。世界这一部分地区的和平将是一支促进世界和平的伟大力量。
    你们无疑知道今年六月中华人民共和国总理应我们的邀请访问了缅甸。你们也知道在我们之间经过自由坦率的交换意见之后，中国和缅甸一致同意了指导两国之间的关系的下面五项原则：
    （一）互相尊重领土完整和主权
    （二）互不侵犯
    （三）互不干涉内政
    （四）平等互利
    （五）和平共处
    这五项和平原则不仅对我们两国而且对世界和平都非常重要。无论是在实利方面还是在正义方面，这五项原则对一切国家都是适当的指导原则。因为我们两国已经一致同意这五项原则，我确信和平共处是有保证的。历史证明，由于像基安西塔和保道那样的国王所作的努力，中国和缅甸曾能够和平相处。现在让我们也来建立一个以你们卓越的总理和我一致同意的五项原则为基础的一个和平共处的地区吧。
    我提议为中华人民共和国毛泽东主席、中华人民共和国副主席朱德将军、常务委员会刘少奇委员长和周恩来总理的健康干杯。
