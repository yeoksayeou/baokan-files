In a speech delivered in his Woodford constituency on November 23rd, Prime Minister Churchill frankly admitted that even before the end of the Second World War, "when hundreds of thousands of Germans were surrendering to us, and our streets were filled with joyous crowds," he, Churchill, had sent a telegram to Field Marshal Montgomery, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in Europe, instructing him to "carefully collect German weapons and store them away, so that if the Soviets continued to advance, it would be very convenient to reissue these weapons to the German soldiers with whom we would have to cooperate." Field Marshal Montgomery admitted to receiving this insidious order.

Such perfidy, such abandonment of allied obligations and responsibilities by Mr. Churchill and Field Marshal Montgomery at the end of the Second World War, is extremely rare in the history of international relations and in the history of many years. Therefore, of course, Churchill's shameless statement has aroused justified indignation everywhere.

Speaking in the British House of Commons on December 1st, Churchill, apparently aware that he had leaked a secret, attempted to defend himself and dilute the impression given by his Woodford speech. He even said that the matter of whether he had sent the aforementioned telegram to Field Marshal Montgomery was doubtful, saying: "It is quite possible that this telegram was never sent at all." But at the same time, in his speech to Parliament, Churchill asserted that whether or not he had sent the telegram, he did indeed have the intention at the time of using Hitler's soldiers and officers against the Soviet army—Britain's ally in the anti-Hitler alliance.

Churchill said, "To return weapons to them (referring to the Hitlerites - Zhukov's note) may not only be a matter of policy, but also a matter of honor." However, on the same day, December 1st, Montgomery once again confirmed that he had indeed received Churchill's telegram in 1945, instructing him to prepare for joint action with the defeated German army in the event that the Russians continued to advance, and he also confirmed that the telegram contained instructions to preserve the equipment of the Hitler army intact.

These admissions by Churchill and Montgomery allow people to understand more clearly the development of the situation at the end of the Second World War and Churchill's policies and practices. And Churchill, as everyone knows, is today one of the most ardent advocates of West German re-militarization, the establishment of a West German "Defense Force," and the pulling of West Germany into certain aggressive military blocs of Western countries.

However, as other facts show, the above admissions by Churchill and Montgomery are far from revealing the full truth of the policy pursued by the Churchill government at the end of the Second World War and shortly after the war ended. These facts show that, as can now be seen quite clearly, the General Headquarters of the British forces in Europe, in accordance with Churchill's orders, not only collected and stored the weapons of the defeated Hitler army in order to equip the remnants of these armies and use them against Britain's allies, but also directly violated the obligations solemnly undertaken by Britain in the Potsdam Agreement of August 1945, and for a long period retained organized units of the Hitler army.

These admissions by Churchill and Montgomery give added significance to some facts recorded by the Allied Control Council for Germany at the end of 1945.

On November 20, 1945, in my capacity as the Soviet representative to the Allied Control Council for Germany, I submitted a memorandum to the Control Council regarding the existence of organized units of the former Hitler army in the British zone of occupation in Germany. In that memorandum, I cited facts proving that even seven months after Germany's unconditional surrender, the British Forces Headquarters in the British zone of occupation still retained organized units of the Hitler army, consisting of hundreds of thousands of German soldiers and officers, with general staffs, administrative organs, logistics, and military command posts. (The full text of the memorandum is attached below)

When the Control Council discussed this memorandum, Montgomery, under the pressure of the facts, had to admit that there were German troops in the British zone of occupation working or waiting for discharge under his orders—according to him. At that time, he hypocritically explained the actions of the British command with alleged technical difficulties in disbanding the German army, although it was clear that this argument was false.

It should be pointed out that, according to the statement made by Montgomery in the Control Council on December 30, 1945, the American command was aware of the actions of the British military command, represented by Field Marshal Montgomery. Montgomery said: I would be surprised if anyone told me that our course of action on this issue (i.e., the issue of the Hitler army) was different from that of my American partners, because the course we are pursuing was determined at the very beginning of the establishment of the unified command led by General Eisenhower.

Cornered by these facts, General McNarney, the American representative to the Allied Control Council for Germany, had to admit that he believed that Field Marshal Montgomery's remarks about the existence of organized military units of the former Hitler army in the British zone of occupation in Germany gave reason to draw the conclusion that he (referring to Montgomery) had not fulfilled the resolutions of the Potsdam Conference. Despite the Soviet representative's repeated just demands in the Allied Control Council for Germany and at the Soviet, American, British, and French Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow in March and April 1947 that the military units in the British zone of occupation in Germany should be completely disbanded, a large number of German military units that had previously constituted part of the Hitler German Army, Air Force, and Navy remained intact.

As everyone knows, a large part of these troops are still under the control of the Anglo-American occupying forces today under the guise of so-called "logistical units," and remain stationed in West Germany.

On December 7th, Churchill once again had to answer questions in the House of Commons about his anti-Soviet intentions. Members of Parliament specifically asked about the agreement reached between Montgomery and Hitler's General Busch regarding the retention of German armed forces and the storage of their weapons. In response to these questions, Churchill said that after the Germans' unconditional surrender, no German armed forces were retained. Obviously, Churchill said this to deceive public opinion once again.

The facts listed above and the admissions of Churchill and Montgomery equally show that as early as ten years ago, Churchill was already prepared to arm the remnants of the defeated Hitler army to fight against an allied country—the Soviet Union—and also show that the origins of the policy currently pursued by the American and British governments of re-militarizing West Germany and establishing a West German "Defense Force" can be traced back to 1945; at that time, Churchill signed with one hand on behalf of his country, undertaking the obligation to immediately and forever eliminate German militarism and abolish the German "Defense Force," while with the other hand he was writing secret orders to retain the weapons and military units of the former Hitler army as the foundation for re-establishing a revanchist German "Defense Force."

Based on these facts, one can say that the honest people of the world will certainly be able to correctly see through the essence of the policies of Churchill and his partners on both sides of the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean, and will certainly not allow themselves to be deceived by the hypocritical arguments that say that arming West Germany is for defensive purposes.

    The Soviet Representative's Memorandum Regarding the Existence of Organized Units of the Former German Army in the British Zone of Occupation
    Allied Control Authority Control Council
    November 20, 1945

The Soviet Representative's Memorandum Regarding the Existence of Organized Units of the Former German Army in the British Zone of Occupation.

According to the Declaration on the Defeat of Germany signed on June 5, 1945, and the Berlin Conference's Resolutions on Germany:

"All German armed forces wherever situated, including all German land, air, anti-aircraft and naval forces, the SS, SA and Gestapo, and all other forces or auxiliary organizations equipped with weapons, shall be completely disarmed."

"All German land, naval and air forces, the SS, SA, Selbstschutz, Gestapo and all their organizations, staffs and institutions, including the General Staff, the Officers' Corps, reserve corps, military schools, organizations of war veterans and all other military and semi-military organizations, together with all clubs and associations which serve to keep alive the military tradition in Germany, shall be completely and finally abolished in order to prevent the revival or reorganization of German militarism and Nazism."

According to the resolutions of the Berlin Conference and the Declaration on the Defeat of Germany: No German land, naval and air force authorities, or land, air, anti-aircraft and naval force units and detachments, may be kept on German territory.

According to materials possessed by the Soviet Command and reports in foreign newspapers, German armed forces and German land, naval, and air force authorities continue to exist in the British zone of occupation in Germany. The German Mueller Corps, renamed the Nord Corps in October, still exists to this day. This corps has a field administrative organ and a command headquarters. The command headquarters of this corps includes:

\tAn operations department, a supply department, a quartermaster department, an officer personnel department, a motor transport department, and a field sanitation department.

The Nord Corps has land, air, and anti-aircraft force formations and units. It includes two corps:
\tA. Stockhausen Corps
\tB. Witthoeft Corps
\tEach corps has more than 100,000 personnel.

In addition to these corps, five German military districts with administrative and logistical institutions have been established within the British zone of occupation in Germany.

The administrative institutions of these German military districts are located in the following cities:

\t1. Hammel
\t2. Itzehoe
\t3. Neumünster-Rendsburg
\t4. Flensburg
\t5. Hamburg

In addition to these German military districts, twenty-five district and local German military commander offices have been established in the following cities and residential areas within the British zone of occupation in Germany: Pinneberg, Segeberg, Lübeck, Lauenburg, Itzehoe, Schkilchin, Berlist, Itzehoe, Eloshorn, Schleswig, Eckernförde, Husum, Westerland, Rendsburg, Schiff, Mane, Wesselburen, Heinstatt, Meldorf, Albertsdorf.

The air force units and authorities in the German British Zone of Occupation form the 11th Air Force District, which includes air defense forces (units of the 18th Air Defense Division), bomber squadrons, fighter squadrons, interceptor squadrons, and short-range reconnaissance aircraft detachments. The 11th Air Force District has its own headquarters, like the headquarters of a wartime air force. The German armed forces in the German British Zone of Occupation have liaison troops (more than five regiments of personnel), tank units, and extensively established military hospitals with more than 20,000 beds. The German Navy currently bears the name of the German Mine Sweeping Force. This German Mine Sweeping Force has a headquarters and possesses a coastal guard division and a fleet.

In addition to the aforementioned German troops and units, there are currently about one million German soldiers and officers in the state of Schleswig-Holstein who have not been converted to prisoner-of-war status and are undergoing military training.

All of the aforementioned land, naval, and air force authorities and their troops and units receive full subsidies in accordance with land force standards. The personnel of the aforementioned troops, units, and administrative institutions wear badges and medals indicating rank and position. Personnel at all levels are undergoing military training, they are promoted, and they enjoy vacations with cash allowances.

It can be seen from the aforementioned facts that the existence of German land, naval, and air force authorities, as well as land, air, anti-aircraft, and naval force troops and units, in the German British Zone of Occupation cannot be explained by any occupational characteristics of the British Zone of Occupation.

The following exist in the British Zone of Occupation:

\tNord German Corps
\tStockhausen Corps
\tWitthoeft Corps
\t11th Air Force District, administrative institutions of the Hammel, Itzehoe, Neumünster-Rendsburg, Flensburg, and Hamburg military districts
\tTwenty-five district and local German military commander offices
\tLiaison troops
\tTank units

This is a violation of the resolutions of the Berlin Conference and the Declaration on the Defeat of Germany.

In addition, the Soviet Command deems it necessary to raise the question of dispatching a committee of the Allied Control Council for Germany to the British Zone of Occupation to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the disarmament of the German armed forces and the disbandment of the German armed forces.

    邱吉尔的无耻行径
    苏联元帅　格·康·朱可夫
    邱吉尔首相十一月二十三日在他的伍德佛选区发表演说时直言不讳地承认，甚至在第二次世界大战结束以前，“在数以十万计的德国人向我们投降、我们的街道上充满了欢乐的人群的时候”，他，邱吉尔就曾经打电报给驻欧英军总司令蒙哥马利元帅，指示他“仔细收集德国人的武器，把它们收藏起来，这样，如果苏联继续前进的话，就可以很方便地把这批武器重新发给我们必须与之合作的德国士兵”。蒙哥马利元帅承认收到了这个居心叵测的命令。
    像邱吉尔先生和蒙哥马利元帅在第二次世界大战结束时这样的背信弃义，这样的背弃同盟义务和责任的行径，在国际关系史和多年来的历史上是非常罕见的。因此，当然，邱吉尔的这种无耻声明在各地引起了正当的愤慨。
    十二月一日在英国下院演说时，邱吉尔显然是意识到自己泄露了机密，就企图为自己辩解和冲淡他在伍德佛的演说给人的印象，他居然把事情说成好像是他曾拍发上述电报给蒙哥马利元帅一事都是值得怀疑的，他说：“很可能是根本没有发过这个电报”。但同时，邱吉尔在向议会的演说中却又肯定地说，不管他是否发过了那个电报，他当时的确曾有使用希特勒的士兵和军官来对付苏军——英国在反希特勒同盟中的盟友——的打算。
    邱吉尔说，“把武器交还给他们（指希特勒分子——朱可夫注）可能不仅是一个政策问题，还是一种荣誉。”然而，在同一天，即十二月一日，蒙哥马利却再次证实他在一九四五年的确曾经收到邱吉尔的电报，要他准备好在一旦俄国人继续前进的情况下就同战败的德国军队采取联合行动，他并且证实，电报中也有叫他把希特勒军队的装备完整无损地保存起来的指示。
    邱吉尔和蒙哥马利的这些供认，使人们能够更清楚地了解第二次世界大战结束时的局势发展以及邱吉尔的政策和实践。而邱吉尔，大家知道，今天也是西德重新军国主义化、建立西德“国防军”和把西德拉进某些西方国家的侵略性军事集团的最狂热的鼓吹者之一。
    但是，如其他一些事实所表明的，邱吉尔和蒙哥马利的上述供认还远没有暴露邱吉尔政府在第二次世界大战末期和大战刚结束不久的时期所奉行的政策的全部真相。这些事实说明，正如现在已经可以十分明显地看出的那样，当时驻欧英军总司令部遵照邱吉尔的命令，不仅曾把被击溃的希特勒军队的武器收集和储藏起来以便装备这些军队的残余，利用他们来反对英国的盟国，而且还直接违背了英国在一九四五年八月的波茨坦协定中所庄严承担的义务，在一段长时期内保留了希特勒军队的有组织的部队。
    邱吉尔和蒙哥马利的这些供认使得一九四五年年底盟国对德管制委员会所记录的一些事实增加了意义。
    在一九四五年十一月二十日，我以盟国对德管制委员会苏联代表的身份，把关于德国英占区存在有组织的前希特勒军队的部队的备忘录交给了管制委员会。在那个备忘录中，我举出了事实，证明甚至在德国无条件投降以后七个月，驻欧英军司令部还在英占区保留了有几十万德国士兵和军官、并拥有参谋本部、管理机构、后勤和军事指挥部的希特勒军队的有组织的部队。（备忘录的全文附在后面）
    在管制委员会讨论这个备忘录的时候，蒙哥马利在事实的压力下，不得不承认在英占区有德国军队在他的命令下——据他说——工作或者等待遣散。那时候，他虚伪地用据说是解散德国军队所存在的技术上的困难来解释英国司令部的行动，虽然很明显，这种论据是虚假的。
    应该指出，从蒙哥马利在一九四五年十二月三十日在管制委员会所发表的声明看来，美国司令部是知道以蒙哥马利元帅为代表的英军司令部的行为的。蒙哥马利说：如果有人对我说，我们在这个问题（即对希特勒军队问题）上的行动方针和我的美国伙伴的行动方针不同的话，我是会感到惊奇的，因为我们执行的方针，是在艾森豪威尔将军所领导的统一司令部一开始建立时就确定了的。
    被这些事实逼得走头无路的盟国对德管制委员会的美国代表麦克纳奈将军不得不承认，他认为蒙哥马利元帅所发表的关于有组织的前希特勒军队的军事部队在德国英占区存在的谈话，使人有理由得出这样一个结论：他（指蒙哥马利）并没有履行波茨坦会议的决议。尽管苏联代表在盟国对德管制委员会上和一九四七年三月到四月在莫斯科举行的苏、美、英、法四国外长会议上，一再提出德国英占区的军事部队应该全部解散的正当要求，但是以往构成希特勒德国陆、空、海军的一部分的大量德国军事部队仍然原封未动。
    大家知道，这些部队有一大部分直到今天还在所谓“后勤部队”的幌子下由英美占领军控制着，留驻在西德。
    十二月七日，邱吉尔又一次不得不在下院中答复关于他的反苏意图的问题。议员们特别问到关于蒙哥马利和希特勒的将军布什所达成的关于保留德国武装部队和收藏他们的武器的协议。邱吉尔在答复这些问题时说，在德国人无条件投降后，并没有保留德国武装部队。显然，邱吉尔说这种话是为了再一次欺骗舆论。
    上面列举的事实和邱吉尔同蒙哥马利的供认同样表明，早在十年以前，邱吉尔就已经准备武装被击败了的希特勒军队的残余来同一个同盟国——苏联——作战，也表明，美国同英国政府现在奉行的使西德重新军国主义化和建立一支西德“国防军”的政策的根源可以一直追溯到一九四五年；当时，邱吉尔一只手代表他的国家签字，承担立即永远消灭德国军国主义并废除德国“国防军”的义务，而另一只手却在写秘密命令，要把前希特勒军队的武器和军事部队保留下来作为重新建立复仇的德国“国防军”的基础。
    根据这些事实，人们就可以说，全世界的正直人民一定能够正确地识破邱吉尔和他的海峡对岸和大西洋彼岸的伙伴们的政策的实质，而且决不会使他们自己受到说什么武装西德是为了防御目的的这种虚伪论据的欺骗。苏联代表关于英国占领区存在着前德国军队的有组织的部队的备忘录一九四五年十一月二十日盟国管制当局管制委员会
    苏联代表关于英国占领区存在着前德国军队的有组织的部队的备忘录。
    根据一九四五年六月五日签订的关于击败德国的宣言和柏林会议关于德国问题的决议：
    “无论驻扎在那里的由德国人统辖的所有德国武装部队——其中包括陆军、空军、防空部队和海军，党卫军、挺进队和秘密警察以及所有其他部队或配备有武器的辅助性组织——应予完全解除武装。”
    “凡德国一切海陆空军、党卫军、挺进队、自卫军、秘密警察及其全部机构、参谋人员及各种组织，连同参谋本部、军官团、后备队、军事学校、退伍军人之一切组织及其他军事与半军事机构，以及足以保持德国军事传统不灭之俱乐部与协会等，应永远完全废除，以防止德国军国主义及纳粹主义之复活及改组。”
    根据柏林会议的决议和关于击败德国的宣言：决不能在德国领土上保留任何德国陆军、海军和空军当局或者陆军、空军、防空部队和海军的部队和单位。
    根据苏联司令部拥有的材料和外国报纸的消息，德国武装部队和德国陆军、海军及空军当局继续在德国的英占区存在。在十月间改名为诺尔德军团的德国穆勒军团一直到现在还存在。这个军团有一个战地管理机构和司令部。这个军团的司令部中包括：
    一个作战部，一个军需部，一个兵站部，一个军官人事部，一个汽车运输部和一个野战卫生部。
    这个诺尔德军团拥有陆军、空军和防空部队的编制和单位。它包括两个兵团：甲、斯托克豪森兵团乙、维特霍夫兵团——每个兵团都拥有十万以上的人员。
    除了这些兵团以外，并在德国的英占区内设立了五个有着管理和后勤机构的德国军区。
    这些德国军区的管理机构设立在下列各城市：一、汉莫尔二、伊泽霍三、纽孟斯特尔—伦茨堡四、法林斯堡五、汉堡
    除了这些德国军区以外，并在德国的英占区内的下列各城市和居民区设立了二十五个区和地方的德国军事司令官办事处：平内柏格、塞格柏格、卢维克、劳恩堡、伊特森、什克基钦、柏里斯特、伊泽霍、埃洛斯霍恩、石勒苏益格、埃肯弗德、胡苏姆、维斯特兰、伦茨堡、希夫、马内、维塞尔布伦、海恩斯塔特、麦尔多夫、阿柏斯多夫。
    德国英占区的空军部队和当局构成了第十一空军军区，这个军区包括防空部队（第十八防空师的部队）、轰炸机中队、战斗机中队、歼击机中队和近距离侦察机大队。第十一空军军区有它自己的总部，像一支战时空军的总部一样。德国英占区的德国武装部队有联络部队（五团人以上）、坦克部队和广泛设立的、有两万多个床位的军事医院。德国海军现在的名称有德国扫雷部队。这支德国扫雷部队设有总部并拥有海岸警卫师和舰队。
    除了上述德国部队和单位以外，目前在石勒苏益格·荷尔斯泰因州还有约一百万名德国士兵和军官，他们并没有转变到战俘的地位而在受军事训练。
    所有上述陆军、海军和空军当局和它们的部队和单位都按照陆军的标准领取充分的津贴。上述部队、单位和管理机构的人员都佩戴表明官阶和职位的徽章和勋章。各级人员全部在受军训，他们得到提升并享受有现钞津贴的假期。
    从上述事实可以看出，德国陆军、海军和空军当局以及陆军、空军、防空部队和海军的部队和单位，在德国英占区的存在是不能用英占区的任何占领特点来解释的。
    英占区存在有：
    诺尔德德国军团斯托克豪森兵团维特霍夫兵团
    第十一空军军区，汉莫尔、伊泽霍、纽孟斯特尔—伦茨堡、法林斯堡和汉堡军区管理机构
      二十五个区和地方德国军事司令官办事处
    联络部队
    坦克部队
    这是违反柏林会议的决议和关于击败德国的宣言的。
    此外，苏联司令部认为有必要提出派遣一个盟国对德管制委员会的委员会到英占区去就地调查裁减德国武装部队的军备和解散德国武装部队的情况的问题。
