    The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor issued a message to workers nationwide, saying: The US imperialists and their lackeys are attempting to disrupt the peaceful life of the Vietnamese people in order to seize profits, and are deliberately obstructing our country from achieving unification, independence, and democracy. They are the most important enemy of the Vietnamese people and also the most dangerous enemy at present. The Vietnam General Confederation of Labor calls on all manual and mental laborers and other people to resolutely stop the claws of the US imperialists, the French colonial elements who are sabotaging the armistice agreement, and their lackeys.
    The Vietnam National Farmers Liaison Committee issued a letter to farmers, denouncing the conspiracy of the US imperialists and its servants, and calling on farmers to heighten their vigilance, increase production, and actively participate in restoration and construction work, in order to contribute to the struggle to consolidate peace and realize national unification, independence, and democracy.
    The Vietnam Youth League said in a letter to youth: In order to crush the conspiracy of the US imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem group to sabotage our country's peace and unification, Vietnamese youth from North Vietnam to South Vietnam must unite more closely and advance under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh. Victory will surely belong to us!
