Most of the roads destroyed by floods in Hubei Province have been repaired by the Hubei Provincial Highway Bureau, which has powerfully supported the farmers in the disaster areas to rebuild their homes and facilitated the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

During the summer flood season this year, 676 kilometers of highways in Hubei Province were destroyed by floods, which seriously hindered highway transportation. In order to quickly repair the highways destroyed by floods, a special agency was established in September by the Highway Bureau to take specific responsibility for technical guidance and material supply for highway repair work. After the flood receded, the Highway Bureau promptly mobilized and organized 100,000 migrant workers to actively participate in the emergency repair work on various highway lines. According to incomplete statistics in mid-November, more than 530 kilometers of the province's various routes have been repaired. At present, on these highway lines, cars are coming and going in an endless stream, actively rushing to transport grain, cotton clothes, seeds, and timber for building houses, as well as other industrial products, to the farmers in the disaster areas, and transporting the local and special products of the countryside to the cities for sale.

    湖北水灾区公路大部修复
    湖北省公路局修复了大部被洪水冲毁的公路，有力地支援了灾区农民重建家园，便利了城乡物资交流。
    今年夏汛期间，湖北省公路被洪水冲毁了六百七十六公里，使公路交通运输受到严重阻碍。为了迅速修复被洪水冲毁的公路，九月间，公路局成立了专门机构，具体负责修复公路的技术指导和材料供应工作。洪水退出以后，公路局就及时发动和组织了十万民工积极参加各公路线的抢修工作。据十一月中旬的不完全统计，全省各线路已经修复的里程有五百三十多公里。目前在这些公路线上，汽车络绎不绝，积极为灾区农民赶运粮食、棉衣、种籽和盖房用的木材，以及其他工业品，并把农村的土、特产品运销到城市。　　　（纪卓如）
