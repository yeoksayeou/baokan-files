Xinhua News Agency, December 25th:

Cooperatives in Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, and other provinces are purchasing and supplying production materials needed by farmers for spring ploughing next year.

The Hubei Provincial Cooperative Affairs Bureau plans to supply farmers with more than ten times the number of new-style farm tools next spring compared to this spring, and about seven times the amount of miscellaneous fertilizers. Currently, over 20,000 eight-inch walking plows and a portion of double-wheeled double-share plows have been successively transported from Northeast and North China to Xiangyang, Jingzhou, and other special districts. More than 10 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds have been transferred from Jiangsu to support farmers in disaster-stricken areas of Hubei. The Hubei Province's various levels of supply and marketing cooperatives have also ordered miscellaneous fertilizers from Yingcheng Gypsum Company, Hunan Bone Meal Factory, and other units to compensate for the farmers' insufficient oilseed cake fertilizer.

The Hunan Provincial Cooperative Union Preparatory Committee is transferring 30,000 dan of cotton seeds and 1,000 dan of jute seeds purchased from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. In addition to transferring hundreds of thousands of dan of dried oilseed cake and bone meal from outside the province, the Union Preparatory Committee has also requested local supply and marketing cooperatives to organize a large amount of miscellaneous fertilizer to supply farmers as base fertilizer for spring ploughing.

The total value of production materials prepared by the Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative is over 55 billion yuan. Among them, fertilizers and farm tools worth nearly 30 billion yuan have been transported to various grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. They are now continuing to transport millions of jin of chemical fertilizers, agents, and a large number of farm tools to the supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties. In late November, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative held an agricultural tool sample exhibition to solicit opinions from purchasers of various grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives.

Cooperatives in Zhejiang and Heilongjiang provinces are also preparing production materials for farmers. According to the requirements of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives, the Pinghu County Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to help farmers adjust 500 large water buffalo next year. In December, the Huachuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative transported 316 horses and 900 double-wheeled double-share plows to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives.

    各地合作社为农民准备春耕生产资料
    【新华社二十五日讯】湖北、湖南、陕西等省供销合作社正为农民采购和供应明年春耕需要的生产资料。
    湖北省合作事业管理局计划明年春季供应给农民的新式农具等于今春的十倍以上，杂肥在七倍左右。目前已有二万多部八吋步犁、一部分双轮双铧犁从东北、华北等地陆续运到襄阳、荆州等专区，还有一千多万斤优良的棉籽已从江苏调来支援湖北灾区农民。湖北省各级供销合作社并和应城石膏公司、湖南骨粉厂等单位订购了杂肥，以补农民饼肥不足。
    湖南省合作社联合社筹备委员会正在调运从江苏和浙江等省采购的三万多担棉籽和一千担黄麻种籽。联合社筹备委员会除已从省外调进几十万担枯饼和骨粉外，并要求各地供销合作社组织大量杂肥，供应农民春耕作基肥。
    陕西省供销合作社已准备的生产资料总值有五百五十多亿元。其中有价值近三百亿元的肥料和农具已运到了各基层供销合作社。现在正继续把数百万斤化学肥料、药剂和大批农具运到各县供销合作社去。十一月下旬，省供销合作社曾举办农具样品展览会，征求各基层供销合作社采购员的意见。
    浙江省和黑龙江省的合作社也正在为农民准备生产资料。平湖县供销合作社根据参加农业生产合作社农民的要求，明年准备帮助农民调剂大水牛五百头。桦川县供销合作社十二月份运给基层供销合作社的有马三百十六匹，双轮双铧犁九百台。
