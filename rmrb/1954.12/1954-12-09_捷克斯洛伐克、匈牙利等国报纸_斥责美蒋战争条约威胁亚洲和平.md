Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 8th: “Rude Pravo” published a commentary on the 7th, denouncing the "Mutual Defense Treaty" signed between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as a serious violation of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and an interference in China's internal affairs. The commentary pointed out that this treaty is a dangerous tool used by American military adventurers to intensify their aggressive activities against the People's China and to further disrupt peace in the Far East. The purpose of this treaty is to intensify the piratical behavior and subversive activities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits against China. However, the Chinese people will never be intimidated by the threats of the United States. Their determination to liberate Taiwan is unchangeable, and the American ambitionists who vainly attempt to seize world hegemony cannot stop their determination.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 8th: Hungary's "Szabad Nép" published an article on the 7th entitled "Aggression Treaty Between Washington and Chiang Kai-shek." The article pointed out that the new treaty concluded between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek is a new step they have taken in expanding aggression. The article pointed out that the treaty stipulates that, in addition to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, the treaty can also be applied to other territories determined by mutual agreement. This proves that the United States is attempting to use the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on a larger scale to carry out war provocations against China. The editorial pointed out that this treaty will aggravate the tense situation in Asia and threaten peace in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: Karachi dispatch: Pakistan's "Today's News" published an editorial on the 6th entitled "Taiwan and the United States." The editorial pointed out: The fact that Taiwan is a part of China is even recognized by the United States itself. The U.S.-Chiang treaty says it wants to "protect" Taiwan, which, in other words, is an attempt to separate Taiwan from China. The editorial said that any attempt to return Taiwan to mainland China cannot be considered an act of aggression, but any attempt to separate Taiwan from China can never be considered a defensive act. The editorial pointed out that the U.S.-Chiang treaty has further complicated the settlement of the Taiwan and Far East issues.

    斥责美蒋战争条约威胁亚洲和平
    【新华社布拉格八日电】　“红色权利报”七日发表评论，斥责美国和蒋介石卖国集团签订的“共同防御条约”是对中国主权和领土完整的严重侵犯，是对中国内政的干涉。评论指出，这个条约是美国军事冒险家用来加紧对人民中国的侵略活动和进一步破坏远东和平的危险工具。这个条约的目的是加紧蒋介石匪徒们对中国的海盗行为和颠覆行动。但是，中国人民决不会被美国的威胁所吓倒，他们要解放台湾的决心是不可改变的，妄想攫取世界霸权的美国野心家阻止不了他们的这个决心。
    【新华社布拉格八日电】　匈牙利“自由人民报”七日发表了一篇题为“华盛顿和蒋介石之间的侵略条约”的文章。文章指出，美国和蒋介石缔结的新条约是他们在扩大侵略的道路上所采取的新步骤。文章指出，这个条约规定，除台湾和澎湖列岛以外，这个条约还可以应用到经共同协议而决定的其他领土。这就证明，美国企图更大规模地利用蒋介石匪徒们对中国进行战争挑衅。社论指出，这个条约将加剧亚洲的紧张局势，威胁亚洲的和平。
    【新华社八日讯】喀喇蚩消息：巴基斯坦“今天报”六日以“台湾和美国”为题发表社论。社论指出：台湾是中国的一部分，这一事实是连美国自己都承认的。美蒋条约说要“保护”台湾，换句话说，就是企图要把台湾从中国割裂开来。社论说，任何使台湾归还中国大陆的企图都不能被认为是侵略的行为，但是任何企图把台湾从中国割裂开来的作法却永远不能被认为是防御性的作法。社论指出，美蒋条约使台湾及远东问题的解决更加复杂化了。
