In recent articles published in *Wenyi Bao*, *People's Daily*, *Guangming Daily*, and other publications criticizing Mr. Yu Pingbo's errors in the study of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, as well as in the discussions held by the Classical Literature Department of the Chinese Writers Association, it has been pointed out that Mr. Yu Pingbo's research on *Dream of the Red Chamber* follows the bourgeois idealist and formalist positions, viewpoints, and methods of Hu Shi, resulting in a serious distortion of the excellent realist classical literary work, *Dream of the Red Chamber*. The discussion of this issue is, in essence, another serious struggle on the ideological front between the working class and the bourgeoisie.

I believe it must also be pointed out in this matter that Mr. Yu Pingbo's positions, viewpoints, and methods in studying *Dream of the Red Chamber*, in addition to being deeply influenced by the comprador bourgeois ideology represented by Hu Shi, also inherited and developed in all its basic aspects the serious influence of the feudal scholar-official class consciousness represented by Jin Shengtan, whom Hu Shi called a so-called "great eccentric." That is to say, Mr. Yu Pingbo's theories and practices in studying *Dream of the Red Chamber* are the product of a combination of comprador bourgeois consciousness and feudal scholar-official class consciousness. In terms of its ideological essence, this is a concrete manifestation of the "reactionary alliance of the enslavement ideology of foreign imperialism and the restoration ideology of Chinese feudalism" [1] attacking Marxist-Leninist ideology in the field of classical literature research.

Therefore, pointing out the close spiritual connection between Mr. Yu Pingbo's thinking in studying *Dream of the Red Chamber* and Jin Shengtan is of great practical significance. For nearly three hundred years, Jin Shengtan's pernicious influence has been extremely profound. His most insidious aspect lies in his adoption of a "rebellious" and "talented" pose, superficially elevating literary works such as *Water Margin* and *Romance of the Western Chamber*, which have always been despised and hated by the feudal ruling class and their court literati, to a very high position. In reality, he used underhanded tactics to extract the distinct populism and rich realist elements they expressed, to castrate the anti-feudal and pro-people immense social significance they contained, and to do his utmost to make them serve the interests of the feudal exploiting class. Jin Shengtan's so-called "Shengtan's Outer Books" deceived and poisoned countless readers throughout the ages. In Mr. Yu Pingbo's research on *Dream of the Red Chamber*, traces of Jin Shengtan's thought returning from the grave can also be clearly seen. Mr. Lu Xun pointed out long ago the historical origins between the so-called "New Redologists" and Jin Shengtan. Mr. Lu Xun believed that Jin Shengtan's "raising novels and romances to the level of *Zuo Zhuan* and Du Fu's poetry was merely picking up Yuan Hongdao's leftovers; moreover, after his commentaries, the original's honesty was often turned into a laughingstock, and the layout and writing were all forcibly dragged into the format of the eight-legged essay. This lingering influence has caused a group of people to fall into the quagmire of always seeking hidden threads and picking out flaws in works like *Dream of the Red Chamber*." [2] It should be pointed out that Mr. Yu Pingbo is precisely the representative who accepted this "lingering influence" and fell into the "quagmire." Therefore, exposing the roots of Mr. Yu Pingbo's errors in studying *Dream of the Red Chamber* in this regard is inseparable from our criticism of bourgeois idealist viewpoints in the field of classical literature research.

Jin Shengtan was a reactionary sycophant in politics and a thoroughgoing idealist in philosophy. His work in commenting on and revising several classical literary works was a concrete manifestation of his reactionary political stance and idealist philosophical views. He believed that "there is nothing in the vast universe." In his mind, "the earth is a dream kingdom, ancient and modern times are dream shadows, honor and disgrace are dream events, and all beings are dream souls" [3]. Therefore, he believed that the so-called "Six Books of Talents" that he touted were themselves dreamlike bubbles, a void, "truly unspeakable," "nothing real to say," "to speak is to be unreal," "to speak of reality is to be wrong"; in his view, of course, there is no right or wrong to speak of, "to discuss is no right or wrong, to debate is no right or wrong; where right is, that is where wrong is; where wrong is, that is where right is." This arrogant nihilist who denied all existence and right and wrong spread his idealist fallacies everywhere in his commentaries on *Water Margin*, *Romance of the Western Chamber*, *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, and other books. In the fourteenth chapter of *Water Margin*, he seized upon the eight characters "Life is but a season, grass and trees a autumn" casually said by Ruan Xiaoqi and wrote a great article on the impermanence of life. Borrowing the title of the "Dreaming" scene in *Romance of the Western Chamber*, he greatly developed his fatalistic view that "Heaven and earth are a dream realm, all beings are dream souls." According to Jin Shengtan's idealist view of "everything and I are one, right and wrong are forgotten," the real life reflected in literary works does not exist; they are all the writer's "splashing ink to create a play," "all made up out of thin air by the writer." According to his view, the creations of many outstanding realist literary masters are merely "finding a topic and writing out their own many elaborate thoughts and eloquent words." After reading the fifth chapter of *Water Margin*, "Lu Zhishen Burns Down Waguan Temple," he thought that "the affairs of the world are also like this." Saying that "a book of one scroll, no more than ten pages, why did Waguan rise, why did Waguan fall, rise and fall only in an instant…", therefore, he "could not help but sigh grandly"; "After all, upside down is empty, are mountains and rivers not like dreams again?" These two sentences represent Jin Shengtan's basic view of the historical truth and the social significance contained in "Water Margin."

If we try to connect these places to look at Mr. Yu Pingbo's research on *Dream of the Red Chamber*, we will feel that in many places, the two people's views coincide. For example, Mr. Yu Pingbo believes that many characters in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, "whether big or small, male or female, with different roles of sheng, dan, jing, mo, and chou, all come together to perform this whole play called 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" [4]. Isn't this completely consistent with Jin Shengtan's theory of "splashing ink to create a play"? For example, Mr. Yu Pingbo analyzes the theme of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, saying: "The Story of the Stone takes dream as its fundamental purpose… fundamentally performing illusion; from the perspective of those in the dream, color is the positive, emptiness is the reverse; from the perspective of those after the dream, emptiness is the positive, color is the reverse." He also said: "What is clearly written is false; on the contrary, what is implied but not revealed is the true purpose of the book." He believes that the author of *Dream of the Red Chamber* "changed his writing style in the third chapter, borrowing Jia Yucun's sending Lin Daiyu into Rongguo Mansion to immediately unfold the dreamlike realm of the Red Chamber." Aren't these views a replica of Jin Shengtan's argument of "upside down emptiness, mountains and rivers like dreams"! This similarity is not accidental; it is precisely determined by the consistency of their idealist views.

As a sycophant who wielded the pen and wagged his tongue, Jin Shengtan completely stood on the anti-people's position. In his work of commenting on and revising classical literary works, he did his utmost to distort the populism and realism of the works, arbitrarily slandering the heroic figures in *Water Margin* who were loved by the people. He knew very well that books such as *Water Margin* were extremely detrimental to the feudal ruling order, and the thrust of their themes was "rebelling against the teachings of the sages and violating the orders of the emperor," "causing the ruler to hesitate above and confusing the people below." However, in contrast to the "burning books" and "banning books" advocates, he believed that "one execution is not enough to cover their guilt, one burning is not enough to extinguish their traces." Therefore, he adopted another method, which was to subvert black and white, confuse right and wrong through his tampering, criticism, and interpretation of the works, to achieve his so-called purpose of "illuminating the past and guarding against the future, rectifying people's hearts, and assisting the king's transformation." He vilified the peasant revolution praised by the people as "a fierce thing" and "an evil thing" that "the world jointly attacks" and "the world jointly abandons"; in the seventieth chapter of *Water Margin*, he fabricated a dream of Lu Junyi, "putting Song Jiang, Lu Junyi, and the other one hundred and eight heroes all beheaded in the grass under the hall." He wrote below: "Truly auspicious words." This precisely represents Jin Shengtan's basic attitude towards the revolutionary heroes of *Water Margin* in a concentrated way.

If we look at Mr. Yu Pingbo's criticism of *Dream of the Red Chamber* in comparison, it also shows this tendency in the essence of its basic attitude and objective effect. The difference is that Jin Shengtan tried to forcibly distort *Water Margin*, which sympathized with and praised the peasant revolution and "lost the dignity of the court and ruined the laws of the state," into a "book of talents" with "the strict aspirations of the Spring and Autumn Annals" that maintained the feudal ruling order; while Mr. Yu Pingbo downplayed and denied the distinct tendency of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, calling it a work that "had very little intention of supporting and praising" the feudal aristocratic class, and "felt that its exposure and criticism were not enough." He even said sarcastically: "Society likes to have opposite contrasts the most. On the stage, there is a red face, and there must be a black face to accompany him, the so-called 'a face of red is more glorious than official robes, a nose of white is stricter than an ax.' In novels, there must be a loyal minister and a treacherous minister… When I was a child, when I heard people telling stories, I would eagerly ask: 'Which one is a good person? Which one is a bad person?' I felt that this was the most important and most brilliant point in the novel. The reading level of the general public in society is about the same as mine at that time. Mr. Xueqin then played a joke on them." From this passage, it can be seen that Mr. Yu Pingbo not only denies the realist nature of *Dream of the Red Chamber* and its clear-cut feelings of love and hate and its clear attitude towards right and wrong, but also completely obliterates the essential difference between loyalty and treachery, good and bad, that exists in actual life and is reflected in all literary works, as well as their complex struggles, and denies all contradictions and social conflicts in life. It can be seen that Jin Shengtan, as a sycophant of the stubborn feudal class, styled himself "a meritorious official of culture" and wanted to tamper with books such as *Water Margin* to replace the "fire of the Qin people"; while Mr. Yu Pingbo, as a defender of the declining bourgeoisie, could only describe *Dream of the Red Chamber* as a naturalist work and sing the platitude of "resentment without anger." However, the basic views of both are consistent in that they are based on idealism and anti-realism.

In order to achieve the purpose of distorting the populism of the works and spreading his idealist views, Jin Shengtan adopted a set of methods in his "Shengtan's Outer Books" that were deliberately mystifying, fragmented, picking out phrases and sentences, and far-fetched. He described these works as very mysterious and profound, saying something like "The most wonderful thing about writing is that at this moment it is seen by spiritual eyes, and at this moment spiritual hands grab it. Because it is not seen a moment before, and it is not seen a moment after," in order to deceive and play with readers. He used sophistry to slander the author of *Water Margin*, saying: "Shi Nai'an told the story of Song Jiang, but titled his book *Water Margin*, hating him to the extreme, expelling him to the extreme, not sharing China with him." Below is a bloody slander, a seemingly right but actually wrong explanation. The names and nicknames of the heroic figures in *Water Margin* were also materials for him to turn black and white and confuse right and wrong. He regarded the appearance of "Jumping Tiger" Chen Da and "White Flower Snake" Yang Chun as "implicitly including the one hundred and eight people in the book seventy times as tigers and snakes, all not good acquaintances." Similarly, he also used the name "Wang Jin" to develop his anti-people fallacy: "What does Wang Jin mean? It says: Only with such a person can the sage be above, and be taught and advance to the kingly way. If this Wang Jin can be taught and advance to the kingly way, then those one hundred and eight people are surely to be punished by the kingly way." All these places, on the one hand, illustrate his reactionary political stance, and on the other hand, also expose his utterly boring and thoroughly formalist ugly face.

Here, we cannot help but think that Mr. Yu Pingbo's basic method of studying *Dream of the Red Chamber* is also similar to Jin Shengtan's. First of all, Mr. Yu Pingbo also repeatedly emphasized that *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a "strange book," a "nightmare," "the more you study it, the more confused you become," you can only "sigh with disappointment," "understanding *Dream of the Red Chamber* and explaining *Dream of the Red Chamber* are very difficult; it seems to be clear here, but you will hit a wall there." Isn't this kind of statement the same as Jin Shengtan's theory of "ineffable"? Similarly, in order to confirm many of his subjective views, Mr. Yu Pingbo forcibly put together "evidence" and carried out fragmented and far-fetched explanations. This shows that, just like Jin Shengtan, Mr. Yu Pingbo has completely fallen into the quagmire of formalism.

Finally, Mr. Yu Pingbo also has one point in common with Jin Shengtan, that is, they both regard literary criticism as a game of life. Jin Shengtan said: "Alas! Life and death are swift, human life is impermanent, wealth and honor are difficult to seek, following what I like, then what else can I do to live without writing books!" He also imposed his view of life on many great authors, believing that "biographical officials have nothing to record, but just want to create unparalleled wonders of writing to entertain themselves." And the function of the works for readers is also to entertain, "assisting their banners and drums of heroic talk and quick laughter before and after drinking tea." This is Jin Shengtan's attitude towards life, and it is also his basic attitude towards commenting on books. Mr. Yu Pingbo also regards studying *Dream of the Red Chamber* as "a good way to spend the summer," "every time he picks up a pen, he is as if divinely assisted." This is exactly the same as the realm described by Jin Shengtan: "New bath in the cool evening, under the bean flower shed, shaking a fan to talk about twists and turns, the interest is not shallow!" Similarly, Mr. Yu Pingbo also said that the author of *Dream of the Red Chamber* regarded creation as a game. He said that Cao Xueqin had no so-called affirmation or denial of Daiyu and Baochai, "If the two peaks stand opposite each other and the two streams of water diverge, each is extremely wonderful and cannot be surpassed, it must be so to exhaust the prosperity of the love scene, it must be so to exhaust the wonder of the article." This is completely consistent with Jin Shengtan's argument. Mr. Yu Pingbo has declared his hedonistic research attitude more than once. He said: "For literature and art, in addition to appreciation, you may as well do a kind of research, but this research should not be called historical or scientific, but just a research of taste." He believes that "appreciating literature and art with a little research is just a way to play the field." This attitude of "playing around" starting from taste is precisely a reappearance of Jin Shengtan's saying of "being full and warm without anything to do, and also feeling free at heart, stretching paper and playing with a pen, leisurely rolling and unfolding by oneself." With such an attitude to study *Dream of the Red Chamber*, it is not surprising that the result will be "the more you study it, the more confused you become," and that you will have the feeling of a "nightmare" and "entering a maze with many different tricks." What is strange is that after liberation, Mr. Yu Pingbo himself declared that he would "follow Chairman Mao's words," "further use Marxist-Leninist literary theory to analyze and criticize it," and achieve "accepting its essence and discarding its dross," but in reality, he completely went against this.

Although we still don't know Mr. Yu Pingbo's own views on Jin Shengtan, the main representatives of bourgeois idealism in literary and art circles since the "May Fourth" Movement, such as Hu Shi and Zhou Zuoren, have always "respected him like a god." Hu Shi said that Jin Shengtan was a "great eccentric" in Chinese literary history who was "very rare"; saying that he had vision, courage, and a "revolutionary spirit"; saying that he was "sharp with his pen and turbulent with his tongue"; "unmatched in eloquence and moving with his pen"; saying that "in the field of novel criticism, his authority directly overthrew the famous critics such as Wang Shizhen, Li Zhi, and Zhong Xing" [5]. He was held up to a very high position. Zhou Zuoren also said: "The first commentary on novels must be Jin Shengtan… When I read *Water Margin*, I pay attention to the text and the commentary equally, as if eating white fungus and swallowing the soup together is good. The same is true of *Romance of the Western Chamber*, especially when Wang Zhuoshan comes out, there is the wonderfulness of comic dialogue" [6]. It can be seen that they all regarded Jin Shengtan as "a friend and teacher who understands writing," and it is, of course, very natural for them to be influenced by him and inherit his mantle. Moreover, it is also very natural and inevitable for comprador bourgeois consciousness and feudal scholar-official class consciousness to combine with each other. Chairman Mao said: "Imperialist culture and semi-feudal culture are very close brothers; they form a reactionary alliance in culture, opposing China's new culture. This kind of reactionary culture serves imperialism and the feudal class, and it should be overthrown. If this kind of thing is not overthrown, no new culture can be established. No destruction, no construction; no blocking, no flowing; no stopping, no moving; the struggle between them is a life-and-death struggle" [7]. From this, we can see the close relationship between these two kinds of thoughts and the serious significance of our struggle today. Precisely because Mr. Yu Pingbo's positions, viewpoints, and methods in studying *Dream of the Red Chamber* have long followed the feudal scholar-official class traditional consciousness of Jin Shengtan and recently followed the comprador bourgeois idealist road of Hu Shi; and precisely because it is not only Mr. Yu Pingbo who is influenced by this kind of influence in the current field of classical literature research, and its harm is also extremely deep; therefore, clearing away bourgeois wrong thoughts and clearing away the remaining poison of feudal scholar-official class thought is of extremely important practical significance.

    俞平伯研究红楼梦的错误的又一根源
    张啸虎
    最近文艺报、人民日报、光明日报等所发表的一些关于批判俞平伯先生在红楼梦研究中的错误的文章中，以及中国作家协会古典文学部为此召开的讨论会中，都指出：俞平伯先生研究红楼梦是沿袭了胡适的资产阶级唯心主义、形式主义的立场、观点、方法，对于优秀的现实主义古典文学作品红楼梦，是一种严重的歪曲。这个问题的讨论实质上是思想战线上工人阶级对资产阶级的又一次严重的斗争。
    我觉得在这个问题上还必须指出来的是：俞平伯先生研究红楼梦的立场、观点、方法，除了直接受了以胡适为代表的买办资产阶级思想的深刻影响以外，同时在其一切基本方面也继承和发展了以被胡适称为所谓“大怪杰”金圣叹为代表的封建士大夫阶级意识的严重影响。这就是说：俞平伯先生的红楼梦研究的理论和实践，是买办资产阶级意识和封建士大夫阶级意识相结合的产物。按其思想本质来说，这是“外国帝国主义的奴化思想和中国封建主义的复古思想的反动同盟”〔一〕在古典文学研究领域中向马克思列宁主义思想进攻的一种具体表现。
    因此，指出俞平伯先生研究红楼梦的思想与金圣叹之间密切的精神联系，是很有现实意义的。近三百年来，金圣叹的恶劣影响是极其深刻的。他的最阴毒的地方，就在于他是以“叛逆”和“才子”的姿态，表面上把一向为封建统治阶级及其御用文人们所鄙弃和痛恨的文学作品如水浒、西厢记等抬到了很高的地位，而实际上他是以偷天换日的手段，抽掉其中所表现的鲜明的人民性和丰富的现实主义因素，阉割其中所包含的反封建的有利于人民的巨大社会意义，竭力使之为封建剥削阶级的利益服务。金圣叹的所谓“圣叹外书”，欺骗和毒害了历代以来的无数读者。在俞平伯先生的红楼梦研究中，也可以显明地看出金圣叹的思想借尸还魂的迹象。鲁迅先生早就指出过所谓“新红学家”们与金圣叹之间的历史渊源。鲁迅先生认为金圣叹“抬起小说传奇来，和‘左传’‘杜诗’并列，实不过拾了袁宏道的唾余；而且经他一批，原作的诚实之处，往往化为笑谈，布局行文，也都被硬拖到八股的作法上。这余荫，就使有一批人，堕入了对于红楼梦之类，总在寻求伏线，挑剔破绽的泥塘。”
  〔二〕应该指出：俞平伯先生正是接受这种“余荫”而堕入“泥塘”的代表。因此，在这一方面揭露俞平伯对红楼梦研究的错误的根源是和我们批判古典文学研究领域中的资产阶级唯心观点的错误是密不可分的。
    金圣叹在政治上是反动的帮闲者，在哲学上是彻头彻尾的唯心主义者。他对几部古典文学作品的评改工作，正是他的反动政治立场和唯心主义哲学见解的具体表现。他认为“大千本无一有”。在他的心目中，“大地梦国，古今梦影，荣辱梦事，众生梦魂”〔三〕。因此，他认为他所标榜的所谓
  “才子书六部”的本身，也是梦幻泡影，一片虚空，“实不可说”，“无实可说”，“说即非实”，
  “说实即错”；在他看来，当然也就无是非可言，
  “论无是非，议无是非；是之所在，即非之所在；非之所在，即是之所在”。这个狂妄的否定一切存在与是非的虚无主义者，在他的水浒、西厢记、三国演义等书的评语中，到处传播他的唯心主义的谬论。在水浒第十四回中，他抓住阮小七偶然说的“人生一世，草木一秋”八个字，便大做其人生无常的文章。他借西厢记中的“惊梦”一折的题目，又把他的“天地梦境也，众生梦魂也”的宿命观点大大地发挥了一番。按照金圣叹这种“物我一齐，是非两忘”的唯心观点，文学作品中所反映的生活真实是不存在的，都是作家“洒墨成戏”，“都是作书人凭空造谎出来”。按照他的看法，许多杰出的现实主义文学大师的创作，只是“寻个题目，写出自己许多锦心绣口”。他读水浒第五回“鲁智深火烧瓦官寺”以后，认为“世界之事，亦如是矣”。说是“一卷之书，不盈十纸，瓦官因何而起，瓦官因何而倒，起倒只在须臾……”，因此，他就“不胜浩然而叹”；“颠倒毕竟虚空，山河不又如梦耶？”这两句话，就是代表着金圣叹对“水浒”所反映的历史真实和所包含的社会意义的基本看法。
    我们试联系这些地方去看俞平伯先生对于红楼梦的研究，就会觉得在许多地方，两人的观点是不谋而合的。比如，俞平伯先生认为红楼梦中的许多人物，“若大若小，男男女女，生旦净末丑角色各异，却大伙儿都来表演这整出的戏叫‘红楼梦’”
  〔四〕。这和金圣叹的“洒墨成戏”论不是完全一致吗？又如俞平伯先生分析红楼梦的主题说：“石头记以梦幻为本旨……本演色空；由梦中人说，色是正，空是反；由梦后人说：空是正，色是反。”又说：
  “明显地写出来的是假的；相反的，含而不露的才是真的，书的本旨。”他认为红楼梦的作者，“到第三回便另换一副笔墨，借贾雨村送林黛玉入荣国府，立即展开红楼如梦的境界了”。像这些地方的观点，岂不正是金圣叹的“颠倒虚空，山河如梦”的议论的翻版！这种相同之处不是偶然的，这正是他们之间唯心主义观点的一致性所决定的。
    作为一个操笔鼓舌的帮闲者，金圣叹完全站在反人民的立场上。他在评改古典文学作品的工作中，竭力歪曲作品中的人民性和现实主义，任意诬蔑水浒中那些为人民所热爱的英雄人物。他深知水浒等书是极不利于封建统治秩序的作品，其主题的锋芒是“叛圣人之教，犯天子之令”，“君读之而彷徨于上，民读之而惑乱于下”。但是，他与“焚书”和“禁书”主义者相反，他认为“一诛不足以蔽其辜，一烧不足以灭其迹”，因此，他采取另外一种手法，这就是通过他对作品的篡改、批评与解说，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，以达到他所谓“昭往戒，防未然，正人心，辅王化”的目的。他把人民所歌颂的农民革命，诬蔑为“天下所共击”“天下所共弃”的“凶物”和“恶物”；他在水浒第七十回中捏造了卢俊义的一个梦，“将宋江、卢俊义等一百单八个好汉，在于堂下草里，一齐出斩。”他在底下批道：“真正吉祥文字”。这正是集中地代表着金圣叹对水浒的革命英雄的基本态度。
    我们对照地来看俞平伯先生对红楼梦的批评，在基本态度的实质上和客观效果上也表现了这种倾向。所不同者，金圣叹是强词夺理地要把同情和歌颂农民革命，“失朝廷之尊，坏国家之法”的水浒，歪曲成为具有“春秋谨严之志”，维护封建统治秩序的“才子书”；而俞平伯先生则是轻描淡写地否认红楼梦的鲜明的倾向性，把它说成是对封建贵族阶级“拥护赞美的意思原很少，暴露批判又觉不够”。他甚至刻薄地说：“社会上最喜欢有相反的对照。戏台上有一个红面孔，必跟着个黑面孔来陪他，所谓‘一脸之红，荣于华衮，一鼻之白，严于斧钺”。在小说上必有一个忠臣，一个奸臣……我小时候听人讲小说，必很急切地问道：‘那个是好人？那个是坏人？’觉得这是小说中最重要、并且最精采的一点。社会上一般人底读书程度，正还和那时候的我差不多。雪芹先生于是狠狠的对他们开一下玩笑。”从这段话可以看出：俞平伯先生是不但否认红楼梦中的现实主义性质及其爱憎分明的感情和是非明确的态度，而且也完全抹煞实际生活中所存在的和一切文艺作品中所反映的忠奸好坏的本质的差别及其复杂的斗争，否认一切生活中的矛盾和社会冲突。可以看出：金圣叹作为顽固的封建阶级的帮闲者，所以以“斯文之功臣”自命，要以篡改水浒等书以代替“秦人之火”；而俞平伯先生作为没落的资产阶级的辩护人，就只能把红楼梦说成是自然主义的作品，唱唱“怨而不怒”的滥调而已。但是，以唯心主义、反现实主义为其基本观点，则是一致的。
    为了要达到歪曲作品的人民性、传播他的唯心观点的目的，金圣叹在他的“圣叹外书”中，采取了故弄玄虚，琐碎割裂，寻章摘句，牵强附会的一套办法。他把这些作品说得非常神秘奥妙，说什么“文章最妙，是此一刻被灵眼觑见，便于此一刻放灵手抓住。盖于略前一刻亦不见，略后一刻便亦不见”，以便蒙哄和玩弄读者。他施用诡辩的伎俩，诬蔑水浒的作者说：“施耐庵传宋江，而题其书曰水浒，恶之至，迸之至，不与同中国也。”下面是一段血口喷人似是而非的解释。水浒中的英雄人物的名字和绰号，也是他颠倒黑白混淆是非的材料。他把“跳涧虎”陈达和“白花蛇”杨春的出现，认为是“隐括一部书七十回一百八人为虎为蛇，皆非好相识也”。同样，他也用“王进”这个名字以发挥其反人民的谬论：“王进之为言何也？曰：必如此人，庶几圣人在上，可教而进于王道也。如此王进，然而可教而进于王道，然则彼一百八人也者，固王道之所必诛也。”所有这些地方，一方面说明他反动的政治立场，而同时也暴露出他底穷极无聊彻头彻尾的形式主义的丑恶面貌。
    在这里，我们也不能不想到俞平伯先生研究“红楼梦”的基本方法也是和金圣叹相似的。首先，俞平伯先生也再三强调红楼梦是一本“奇书”，是个“梦魇”，“你越研究便越觉糊涂”，只能“望洋兴叹”，“了解红楼梦，说明红楼梦都很不容易，在这儿好像通了，到那边又会碰壁”。像这样的说法，和金圣叹的“妙不可言”论岂不是如出一辙？同样，俞平伯先生为了要证实自己许多主观主义的见解，生拉硬凑地找“证据”，进行琐碎割裂，牵强附会的解释。这是说明：正如金圣叹一样，俞平伯先生是完全堕入了形式主义的泥塘。
    最后，俞平伯先生还有一点和金圣叹相似的，就是他们都把文学批评工作当做人生的游戏。金圣叹说：“嗟乎！生死迅疾，人命无常，富贵难求，从吾所好，则不著书又何以为活也！”他还把他的这种人生观强加到许多伟大作者的身上，他认为“稗官之家，无事可纪，不过欲成绝世奇文，以自娱乐”。而作品对于读者的功用，也是在于娱乐，“助其酒前茶后，雄谭快笑之旗鼓”。这就是金圣叹的人生态度，也是他评书的基本态度。俞平伯先生同样把研究红楼梦当做“消夏良方”，“每一执笔，必奕奕有如神助也。”这和金圣叹所描写过的境界：“晚凉新浴，豆花棚下，摇扇说曲折，兴复不浅也！”对照起来，正是异曲同工。同样，俞平伯先生也说红楼梦的作者是把创作当成游戏。他说到曹雪芹对于黛玉和宝钗，无所谓肯定和否定，“若两峰对峙双水分流，各极其妙莫能相下，必如此方极情场之盛，必如此方尽文章之妙。”这和金圣叹的论调是完全一致的。俞平伯先生不止一次地宣称他的趣味主义的研究态度。他说：“对于文艺，除掉赏鉴以外，不妨作一种研究，但这研究，不当称为历史的或科学的，只是趣味的研究。”他认为“欣赏文艺附带一点研究，亦只是逢场作戏而已”。这种“闹着玩”的从趣味出发的态度，正是金圣叹所说的“饱暖无事，又值心闲，伸纸弄笔，舒卷自姿”的重现。以这样的态度来研究“红楼梦”，会得出“越研究便越觉糊涂”的结果，会产生“梦魇”和“进入五花八门的迷魂阵”的感觉，当然就一点也不奇怪了。奇怪的是：俞平伯先生在解放以后，自己宣称要“遵照毛主席的话”，要“进一步用马克思列宁主义的文艺理论来分析批判它”，要做到“接受其精华，扬弃其糟粕”，但是实际上却完全与此背道而驰。
    我们虽然还不知道俞平伯先生自己对于金圣叹的看法如何，但是，“五四”以来文艺界资产阶级唯心主义的主要代表人物如胡适、周作人等，对于金圣叹是一向“敬之如神明”的。胡适说金圣叹是中国文学史上“很不可多得”的“大怪杰”；说他有眼光，有魄力，有“革命的精神”；说他是“笔端有刺，舌底澜翻”；“辨才无敌，笔锋动人”；说他“在小说批评界，他的权威直接推翻了王世贞、李贽、钟惺等有名的批评家”〔五〕。把他捧到了很高的地位。周作人也说过：“小说的批第一自然要算金圣叹……我读水浒，本文与批同样的留意，如吃白木耳和汤同咽才好。西厢亦然，王斫山出来时尤其有相声之妙”〔六〕。可以看出：他们都把金圣叹当做“文章知己友兼师”，而受他的影响，继承他的衣钵，当然是很自然的事情。而且，买办资产阶级意识和封建士大夫阶级意识互相结合起来，也是很自然的事情和必然的结果。毛主席说过：“帝国主义文化和半封建文化是非常亲热的两兄弟，它们结成文化上的反动同盟，反对中国的新文化。这类反动文化是替帝国主义和封建阶级服务的，是应该被打倒的东西。不把这种东西打倒，什么新文化都是建立不起来的。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争”〔七〕。由此可见这两种思想的密切关系和我们今天的斗争的严重意义。正因为俞平伯先生研究红楼梦的立场、观点、方法，是远袭金圣叹的封建士大夫阶级传统的意识，近沿胡适的买办资产阶级唯心主义的道路；也正因为当前古典文学研究领域中受这种影响的并不只是俞平伯先生一人，而其毒害也是极其深重的；因此，肃清资产阶级的错误思想，肃清封建士大夫阶级思想的遗毒，就具有极其重要的现实意义。
