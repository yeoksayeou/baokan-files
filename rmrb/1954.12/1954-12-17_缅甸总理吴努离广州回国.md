When I arrived at Beijing Airport on December 1st, I made a speech briefly explaining the purpose of our visit to China. I am now very happy to say that all three main purposes have been achieved. These three purposes are: (1) to personally study the methods used here in building a new China; (2) to meet and hold discussions with the leaders; (3) to lay a solid foundation for Sino-Burmese friendship. I have had the opportunity to see that the Chinese government and people are now carrying out various construction works with extraordinary enthusiasm, and I have also had the opportunity to meet with Chinese leaders. We had complete freedom to visit every place we wanted to visit, and we enjoyed every convenience that made our stay here both pleasant and rewarding.

"In my discussions with the leaders of this great country, we discussed not only issues of common concern to both countries, but also issues related to world peace. These discussions were conducted freely and frankly in a very harmonious atmosphere. When I return to Burma, I will bring back the most pleasant memories of this great country. I will also bring back certain impressions: (1) the courage and determination of the Chinese leaders headed by Chairman Mao; (2) the enthusiasm and vigorous, joyful spirit of the masses; (3) the amazing restoration work that is now underway; (4) the significant improvement in living standards; (5) the fervent desire of the Chinese people for peace.

"I am now returning to Burma with the determination to do my best to promote friendly relations between China and Burma. Not only that, I will do everything in my power to promote world peace. Long live Sino-Burmese friendship! May the leaders of the People's Republic of China lead their people to achieve their goals of happiness and prosperity."

After Prime Minister U Nu boarded the plane, he stood at the hatch and waved goodbye to the well-wishers.
