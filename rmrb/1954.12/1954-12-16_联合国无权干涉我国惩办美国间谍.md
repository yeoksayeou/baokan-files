The recent judgments by the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of China against American spies Arnold and Downey, among others, who were captured after illegally crossing our country's borders, and the public announcement by the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China, have thoroughly exposed the crimes of the United States in using spies and secret agents to carry out subversion and sabotage against our country. In order to divert the attention of the world's people and evade condemnation by world public opinion, the American ruling clique has fabricated a so-called "Complaint Regarding Actions of Detaining and Imprisoning United Nations Military Personnel in Violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement"案（case） and submitted it to the current session of the United Nations General Assembly. They have manipulated the Assembly to pass this absurd proposal, attempting to use the United Nations as a fig leaf to cover up America's crimes.

It is well known that the crimes of the two groups of American spies punished by our government according to law are irrefutable and supported by conclusive evidence. Using spies and secret agents to carry out subversive activities and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries has always been an important means of American aggressive diplomacy. James Burnham, a reactionary theorist of the American Republican Party and a professor of philosophy at New York University, wrote in his book "The Struggle for the World," published in 1947: "To crush communism in the Soviet Union and other countries, it is better to start from within than from a war coming from the outside, and we must take the approach of starting from within." Last year, in another extremely reactionary work, "Containment or Liberation," he demanded that the Eisenhower-Dulles government intensify its espionage activities against the countries of the peaceful democratic camp, especially the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. He said: "Ten spies lurking behind enemy lines are better than a hundred, even a thousand, soldiers in front of the enemy." This "theory" is undoubtedly an important basis for American aggressive foreign policy. The so-called "Foreign Aid Act" for the American fiscal year 1954 approved nearly $100 million specifically for subversive and sabotage activities in Asia and Europe, specifying that the main targets for use in Asia were China and Korea. The warmongering General Wedemeyer openly stated in Toronto, Canada, on January 25 this year that sending intelligence personnel into China to carry out subversive and sabotage activities was "wiser" than directly attacking the Chinese mainland with armed forces. Clearly, the American ruling clique has made subversive activities against the legitimate governments of sovereign countries a policy of the American government.

The American government's dispatch of spies and secret agents to sneak into our country to gather information about our national defense and to dream of establishing "base areas" for armed secret agents, conducting armed rebellions, and plotting to subvert our people's regime seriously threatens our country's security and completely violates Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the United Nations Charter. This clause clearly states: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations."

The American government's dispatch of spies and secret agents to enter our country to carry out subversive activities is an illegal act of interference in our internal affairs. The French bourgeois international law scholar Fauchille, in his book "International Law," stated the following when discussing forms of intervention: "Modern intervention can also be distinguished as overt intervention and covert or concealed intervention. The former uses armed forces or presents verbal or written diplomatic notes. The latter is more dangerous because it is insidious and hidden, and is carried out by using secret agents sent to foreign countries or recruited in foreign countries." Facts prove that the American government not only openly interferes with the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan but also sends spies and secret agents to carry out covert interference in China's internal affairs.

There is no doubt that the American government's dispatch of spies and secret agents to plot the overthrow of the People's Republic of China is a complete violation of international law. The British international law scholar Lauterpacht, in his expanded edition of Oppenheim's "International Law," affirmed the following when discussing activities aimed at subverting foreign countries: "Such activities, if initiated directly by the government itself, or indirectly by organizations that receive government funding or other support, or that have close ties to the government under the country's constitution, still constitute acts that violate international law." Therefore, the United States absolutely cannot escape responsibility for interfering in our internal affairs and violating international law.

Lodge, the American representative to the United Nations General Assembly, shamelessly resorted to his usual trick of calling a deer a horse, groundlessly claiming that the eleven American spies were so-called "United Nations military personnel" shot down in Korean airspace and should therefore be returned to the United States as "prisoners of war." This is simply the most shameless denial. The eleven American spies, including Arnold, were not arrested in Korea but within the borders of the People's Republic of China. Irrefutable evidence and the confessions of these spies themselves have confirmed that they were American secret agents who sneaked into China to carry out espionage activities, not military personnel fighting on the Korean battlefield. They were caught as criminals endangering China's national security. Therefore, punishing these American secret agents and spies is a matter within our country's sovereignty, and our judicial organs are fully entitled to sentence them to deserved punishments in accordance with our domestic law, which no one can interfere with. The American international law scholar Eagleton pointed out in his book "International Government": "A country can establish the courts or other formal bodies that it wishes to establish, and such formal bodies independently decide the legality of various acts within their jurisdiction, and other countries should not interfere." Another American international law scholar, Hyde, in his book "International Law as Interpreted and Applied by the United States," published in 1947, summarized many American official documents and court precedents and also reached the conclusion: "In establishing and maintaining its judicial system, a country enjoys great freedom." "The scope of a court's jurisdiction is, in one sense, a matter of domestic law, and this scope must be determined according to the will of the territorial sovereign."

Therefore, the United Nations General Assembly, under American manipulation, has passed the so-called sixteen-nation

    联合国无权干涉我国惩办美国间谍
    林欣
    最近我国最高人民法院军事审判庭，对偷越我国国境而被捕获的美国间谍阿诺德和唐奈等人的判决，以及中华人民共和国公安部所发表的公报，彻底地揭发了美国用特务间谍对我国进行颠覆破坏活动的罪行。美国统治集团为了转移世界人民的视线，以逃避世界舆论的谴责，竟向联合国大会本届会议无中生有地提出一个所谓“对违反朝鲜停战协定拘留和监禁联合国军事人员的行动的控诉”案，并操纵大会通过了这一荒谬的提案，妄图利用联合国作为掩盖美国的罪行的遮羞布。
    人所共知，被我国政府依法惩处的两批美国间谍的罪行，证据确凿，是抵赖不了的。利用间谍和特务来进行颠覆活动，和干涉他国内政，原是美国侵略外交的重要手段。美国共和党的反动理论家、纽约大学的哲学教授詹姆斯·白恩汉曾在一九四七年出版的“为统治全世界而斗争”一书中写道：“在苏联和在其他各国进行粉碎共产主义，与其从外部而来的战争着手，毋宁从内部着手，而我们必须采取从内部着手的办法。”去年他又在另一本极端反动的著作“遏制政策或解放政策”中，要求艾森豪威尔—杜勒斯政府加紧对和平民主阵营各国，特别是对苏联和中华人民共和国进行特务间谍活动。他说：“潜伏敌后十人，胜过敌前百人，甚至千人。”这种“理论”无疑地是美国侵略外交政策的重要根据。美国一九五四会计年度的所谓“援外法案”，就又批准了将近一亿美元的专款作为在亚洲和欧洲进行颠覆破坏活动之用，而指明在亚洲使用的主要对象是中国和朝鲜。好战的魏德迈将军今年一月二十五日在加拿大多伦多公开说，派遣特务人员进入中国进行颠覆破坏活动比直接用武装力量进攻中国大陆“明智”得多。显然，美国统治集团把对主权国家的合法政府进行的颠覆活动，已经作为美国政府的政策了。
    美国政府派遣间谍和特务分子偷入我国境内，刺探我国国防情况，并梦想建立武装特务的“根据地”，进行武装暴乱，图谋颠覆我人民政权的罪恶活动，严重地威胁着我国的安全，完全违反了联合国宪章第二条第四款的规定。这一条款明明说：“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立。”
    美国政府派遣间谍特务进入我国境内进行颠覆活动，是干涉我国内政的非法行为。法国资产阶级国际法学者福希尔，在其所著“国际法”中谈到干涉的形式时说：“现代干涉还可区别为公开的干涉和暗中的干涉或隐蔽的干涉。前者使用武装力量或提出口头或书面的外交照会。后者更危险了，因为它是阴险的，并且是暗藏的，是利用派遣到外国去的，或在外国收买招募的特务而进行的。”事实证明，美国政府不仅公开干涉中国人民解放台湾，并且派遣间谍特务来进行隐蔽的干涉中国内政。
    毫无疑问，美国政府派遣间谍特务，图谋颠覆中华人民共和国的行为，是完全违反国际法的。英国的国际法学家劳特派特在其增编的奥本海国际法中，谈到图谋颠覆外国的活动时，肯定地指出：“这样的活动如果是政府本身所直接发动的，或是间接地由接受政府财政或其他赞助、或根据国家的宪法与政府有密切关系的组织所发动的，则仍构成破坏国际法的行为。”因此，美国绝对无法逃避干涉我国内政，破坏国际法的责任。
    美国出席联合国大会的代表洛奇竟施其指鹿为马的惯伎，毫无根据地硬说这十一名美国间谍是在朝鲜领空被击落的所谓“联合国军事人员”，因而应该作为“战俘”遣返给美国。这简直是最无耻的抵赖。美国间谍阿诺德等十一人不是在朝鲜而是在中华人民共和国国境之内被捕的。根据无可辩驳的证据和这些间谍分子的自供，都证实了他们是窜进中国来进行间谍活动的美国特务，而不是在朝鲜战场上作战的军事人员。他们是作为危害中国国家安全的罪犯落网的。因此，惩处这些美国特务间谍，是我国主权范围内的事情，我国的司法机关完全可以根据我国的国内法对他们判以应得之罪，这是任何人所不能干涉的。美国的国际法学家伊格尔顿，在他的“国际政府”一书中就曾指出：“一国可设立其所欲设立之法庭或其他正式机关，而此种正式机关在其司法权以内独自决定各种行为之合法与否，其他国家不得过问。”另外一个美国的国际法学家海德，在其一九四七年出版的“美国所解释和适用的国际法”一书中，归纳了许多的美国官方文件和法院判例之后，也得出这样的结论：“在建立和维持其司法制度的过程中，国家享有巨大的自由”。“一个法庭的管辖权的范围，在一种意义上来说，是国内法的事情，同时这个范围必须根据领土主权者的意志来决定。”
    因此，联合国大会在美国操纵下通过所谓十六国提案，干涉我国主权，把联合国变成为美国特务间谍的庇护所，这是不能容许的。这个决议完全违反联合国宪章。联合国宪章第二条第七款规定：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决。”联合国这种违反宪章而屈从于美国压力的做法，只能使它自己的威信受到难以估计的损害，而降为美国推行“冷战”政策的工具。联合国通过的这个决议不仅是非法的，而且也是无效的。
