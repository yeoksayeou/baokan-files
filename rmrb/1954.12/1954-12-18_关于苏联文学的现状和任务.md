On the Status and Tasks of Soviet Literature
　　——Summary of the report by A. Surkov, First Secretary of the Soviet Writers' Union Committee, at the Second All-Union Writers' Congress

A. Surkov, First Secretary of the Soviet Writers' Union Committee, delivered a report on "The Status and Tasks of Soviet Literature" at the Second All-Union Writers' Congress, which opened in Moscow on December 15. In the opening part of the report, he outlined the development of Soviet literature during the twenty years since the First All-Union Writers' Congress.

Surkov said that twenty years ago, Gorky said at the First All-Union Writers' Congress:

"If the foundation for uniting the literature of the entire Soviet Union is laid in this hall, then after the congress, we must begin practical unity in order to make our arduous work successful, and we must continue this work, developing it more and more extensively and profoundly, in order to establish a great literature, a literature that is needed not only by our country, by all the peoples of our country, but also, I dare say, by the whole world."

For twenty years, Soviet literary workers have kept in mind the exhortations of this great friend and strict mentor while working, and felt that they were the legitimate inheritors of the entire literary heritage created by the genius of human art.

Soviet literature, both in terms of its overall creative development and in terms of the life paths of its outstanding representatives, is closely linked to the people. Soviet literature actively participated in socialist construction and in all the most important socio-political events that occurred on our road to communism.

The activeness of Soviet writers in participating in domestic socio-political life has reached an unprecedented height. One hundred and fifty writers who enjoyed the high trust of the people were elected as representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Soviets of the fraternal republics, and local Soviets. In the past twenty years, Soviet writers have actively participated in all the most important progressive movements of world public opinion. In the years after World War II, Soviet writers became the most active participants in the worldwide struggle for peace.

During the twenty years between the two congresses, tremendous changes took place in the Soviet literary world. New people have emerged in the literary world, and the number of members and candidate members of the Soviet Writers' Union has increased from 1,500 in 1934 to 3,695 in 1954. Compared with the time of the First Congress, the literary world has been consolidated, new forces have been added, and new works have been added. The literature of new fraternal nationalities has emerged and developed. With the return of the peoples of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, part of Bessarabia in Moldova, Bukovina, Transcarpathian Ukraine, and the western regions of Ukraine and Belarus to the embrace of the Soviet Union, a large number of talented writers from these places joined the Soviet literary world.

The continuous expansion and deepening of the cultural revolution has added tens of millions of new readers to the literary world. The emergence of these readers has determined a substantial increase in the number of copies of literary works published.

This increase can be clearly seen from the following figures.

　　In 1934, 1,852 kinds of Russian Soviet literary works were published nationwide, totaling 32,943,000 copies. In 1953, 2,733 kinds of works were published, totaling 159,800,100 copies.

　　In 1934, 1,233 works by writers from other fraternal nationalities in the Soviet Union were published, totaling 7,192,000 copies. In 1953, 1,552 works were published, totaling 38,526,000 copies.

　　In 1934, the Soviet Union published 348 kinds of foreign literary works, totaling 4,797,000 copies. In 1953, 420 kinds of works were printed, totaling 24,480,000 copies.

Classical works are particularly widely circulated in our country. Gorky's works have been published in 80 million copies, Pushkin's works in 70 million copies, Tolstoy's works in 60 million copies, Chekhov's works in 40 million copies, Turgenev's works in 33 million copies, and Gogol's works in 29 million copies. The works of Korolenko, Krylov, Lermontov, Nekrasov, and Saltykov-Shchedrin, etc., have been published in numbers ranging from 16 million to 21 million copies.

The works of many foreign writers have been published in the Soviet Union in 1 million to 12 million copies. These writers are: Balzac, Jules Verne, Hugo, Zola, Maupassant, Theodore Dreiser, Jack London, Mark Twain, Daniel Defoe, Dickens, Jonathan Swift, Shakespeare, Heine, Goethe, Schiller, Cervantes, etc.

In addition to this, it should be added that the works of forty-seven Russian Soviet writers have been published in our country in 1 million to 20 million copies, including poetry collections by nine poets, and the books of V. Mayakovsky have been published in 23 million copies.

If we consider the fact that there are more than 300,000 libraries in our country, which deliver books to tens of millions of readers, we can correctly understand the breadth of the readership of literary and artistic works.

Surkov also talked about the continuous strengthening of creative connections between literary workers of various nationalities in the Soviet Union. He said that this is one of the most vivid evidences of the victory of our Party and the country's ethnic policy in the cultural sphere.

Many small ethnic groups that were previously in a state of illiteracy and destined to extinction have been reborn under Soviet power and are living new lives. More than forty ethnic groups had their own writing for the first time after the October Revolution. These ethnic groups have created and are victoriously developing their own national art and their own literature.

In the literature of the fraternal nationalities, the scope of themes has been infinitely expanded, the elaboration of the most important contemporary issues has become more profound, and the range of life phenomena that writers can describe has expanded.

Surkov emphasized the important role of the Russian language in exchanging cultural wealth. Under the conditions of the victory of the Communist Party's wise ethnic policy, in our society, the Russian language has assumed the glorious role of being a powerful tool for exchanging the cultural and literary wealth of the fraternal nationalities of the Soviet Union. This role of the Russian language has become even stronger in recent years, because in the context of the growing interest of foreign readers in the works of writers from the fraternal nationalities of the Soviet Union, these works are often translated from Russian into many foreign languages.

He said that, of course, the literature of each fraternal nationality has absorbed the experience of Russian classical literature and Soviet literature according to its own needs. More mature literatures, such as Ukrainian literature, Latvian literature, and some of Georgian literature, Armenian literature, and Azerbaijani literature, had relatively rich realistic prose works in the past. In their Soviet period of development, they inherited their own national traditions on the one hand, and integrated the experience and traditions of Russian classical literature and Soviet literature on the other hand, combining the two.

The situation is different for the literatures of some fraternal nationalities, whose prose and dramatic works were even in their infancy at the time of the First All-Union Writers' Congress. For the literatures of dozens of such nationalities, Russian prose and drama (of course, while making use of the classical heritage of world literature) has been, and still is, the main source for learning creative experience.

One of the most significant results of the development of our multinational literature in the period between the two congresses is the growing creative interaction and mutual influence between the literatures of the fraternal nationalities. The intense work of writers translating each other's works plays a major role in this regard.

During this period, not only the classical literary works of the fraternal nationalities that were already well-known, but also those that entered the realm of our people's cultural life for the first time, were promptly translated into Russian and the languages of some fraternal nationalities, and the level of translation was very high.

The scope of translating excellent works by contemporary Soviet writers of various nationalities into Russian and other fraternal nationalities' languages has also expanded.

Without the slightest underestimation of the significance of the experience of Russian classical writers and modern Russian literature for the development of all the literatures of the fraternal nationalities, we also point out, with a sincere sense of pride in our common achievements, the mutual influence that the great creations of the classical writers of the fraternal nationalities and the excellent works of some modern writers have exerted on all literatures, including Russian literature.

Surkov pointed out that many famous Soviet writers participated in the work of translating literary works of the fraternal nationalities, but sometimes people with weak talents also participated in this important work.

The Second All-Union Writers' Congress should strictly instruct the new Writers' Association Committee to seriously rectify the translation work and regard this work as a very important cultural and political task.

Surkov listed some figures and facts to illustrate the growing interest of foreign readers in Soviet literature.

Before the First All-Union Writers' Congress, the works of ninety-seven Soviet writers had been translated into foreign languages.

From 1945 to 1953, according to very incomplete statistics, the people's democratic countries and capitalist countries published more than nine hundred works by Soviet writers, totaling forty-four foreign language translations, with more than nine thousand printings. From 1951 to 1953 alone, foreign countries published 94,196,000 copies of Soviet literary and artistic works. This shows how popular our literature is with foreign readers. Of course, translations of Soviet literary and artistic works are most widely circulated in the people's democratic countries and people's China. However, in the post-war years, our books also broke through the "Cold War" atmosphere, overcame the obstacles between our literature and the broad readers of the capitalist world, and were translated and published in Austria, Britain, Argentina, Burma, Brazil, the Netherlands, Denmark, India, Italy, Lebanon, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan, the United States, Uruguay, Finland, France, Switzerland, Sweden, Japan, and many other countries.

Due to the increase of tens of millions of readers in the people's democratic countries and millions of readers in the capitalist countries, the number of readers of our literary works has almost doubled.

We should always remember the special position that our literature occupies among the literatures of the world: for the working people of foreign countries, it is a source of bright, optimistic ideas and fighting power, and for advanced and progressive writers of foreign countries, it is a source of creative experience.

Literary figures in the people's democratic countries pay close attention to all issues related to the history of the development of our literature. In order to more deeply understand how to specifically embody the method of socialist realism in literary works, they are deeply interested in everything that can enrich their understanding in this regard. Therefore, every literary figure in the Soviet Union bears a great responsibility for his own works. And every critic, theorist, and writer also bears a great responsibility for every word they say when commenting on various issues in our literature.

There is no doubt that our friends, the progressive writers in the capitalist countries, also pay very close attention to the creative experience of Soviet literature.

The excellent works of our friends not only contain the beginning of sharp and uncompromising criticism of modern capitalist activities, but also contain the ideas, feelings, and images that embody the progressive, optimistic beginning of life.

Surkov then talked about the role of Soviet literature in the years of the Great Patriotic War. Writers of various fraternal nationalities of the Soviet Union were a fighting force of Soviet patriots during this period. At the beginning of the war, more than a thousand Soviet writers (more than one-third of all Soviet writers) voluntarily joined the ranks of the fighting army and navy.

Soviet writers were active on all fronts of the Great Patriotic War, carrying weapons or with the pen and notebook of front-line reporters, walking the arduous road from the Black Sea to the Barents Sea, among the defenders of heroic cities, and among the heroic people's revenge partisans, together with the heroes and the readers of their works.

We will always solemnly remember the names of A. Gaidar, V. Stavsky, Yu. Krymov, S. Gikovsky, B. Levin, M. Chumandrin, B. Rabin, Z. Hatslevin, S. Semyonov, A. Afinogenov, E. Petrov, D. Artausen, I. Utkin, O. Desniak, S. Tudyr, T. Gulia, A. Gavriliuk, F. Karim, and the names of more than two hundred of our comrades, writers of various fraternal nationalities, who sacrificed themselves in the Great Patriotic War.

The great patriotic upsurge of the Soviet people in the war years was reflected in the works created in these unforgettable years in a heroic, truthful, and moving way.

The contrast between the fate of our literature in the war and the fate of the "pure art" practitioners of bourgeois literature is like the difference between light and darkness. In the years when temporarily successful fascism threatened the survival of France and Britain, only the most honest democratic literary figures remained loyal to their people. The other many writers either moved abroad to escape the night air raids suffered by London and Coventry, or "closed their doors and lived in seclusion," thereby practically surrendering to the enslavers, or shamelessly served the invaders with their pens.

The glorious tradition of Gorky's fiery political essays was carried forward by a large number of Soviet writers in the years of the Great Patriotic War. The burning words in Ehrenburg's articles are still unforgettable in the hearts of millions of people in the Soviet Union and abroad. Gorbachev's sincere and solemn "Letters to Friends" cannot be read without being moved to this day. The diaries and essays of Tikhonov and V. Vishnevsky vividly reappear the difficult and heroic life of the people of Leningrad during the siege. V. Grossman's excellent features made tens of millions of people not only understand but also feel the glory of the achievements of the defenders of Stalingrad.

In the summer of 1942, when the enemy approached Stalingrad, Sholokhov's passionate short story "The Science of Hatred" was recited throughout the country. In making a correct evaluation of Soviet wartime literature, one cannot fail to mention the wartime political essays and features of A. Tolstoy, A. Fadeyev, L. Leonov, K. Fedin, V. Ivanov, P. Pavlenko, V. Lacis, D. Zaslavsky, V. Stavsky, K. Simonov, B. Polevoy, B. Galin, Jan Sudrabkaln, P. Kočar, Van. Vasilevska, Ya. Galan, and other Soviet writers.

It is a great pity that the experience of writers who wrote prose and plays on war themes during the war has not been critically studied and summarized.

Surkov then presented the works of prose writers, poets, playwrights, and political commentators who have been well received by the broad readers of the Soviet Union—representatives of multinational Soviet literature. Surkov talked in detail about the creative methods of some writers, analyzed their works, and explained the degree of improvement in the ideological and artistic quality of Soviet literature.

Surkov said that half a century ago, Lenin wrote in his article "Party Organization and Party Literature": "Literary work is least subject to mechanical leveling, standardization, and the submission of the minority to the majority." "In this cause, the broadest scope must be unconditionally guaranteed for personal creativity, personal preferences, the broad scope of thought and imagination, and the broad scope of form and content."

Lenin's words have been confirmed by the entire course of development of our literature. Lenin's words mean that under the general guideline of formulating the method of socialist realism, various different schools of thought can be allowed to exist, creative competition between different schools of thought can be allowed, and broad debates on the advantages of various schools of thought can be allowed.

Although writers have the same evaluation of life phenomena and human behavior, the variety of ways in which they express the results of their respective observations and feelings through artistic images is endless. According to "style," "rhythm," and the treatment of themes, we can accurately distinguish Prokofiev and Shervinsky, Mirshakar and Tursun-Zade. However, in contrast, we can hardly feel the difference between contemporary Western modernists. They are all the same. The common point of their "works" is that they are empty, tasteless, and completely impersonal.

Surkov briefly summarized the discussions on the issue of positive characters in Soviet literature that took place before the congress. He said that the works of Fadeyev, Gaidar, Ostrovsky, Polevoy, Irina's "Fourth Height" (Xinhua News Agency editor's note: the Chinese translation is entitled "The Road of Gulya"), and books about Zoya and Matrosov and other real heroes in our real life are forever alive in the hearts of young readers and touch their hearts. This is because these works, unlike the precepts of those bookworms who dream of "ideal heroes," all describe living people of our time, people of an era in which new characteristics, new morals, and new norms of personal and social relations are constantly formed.

When analyzing the issue of creating satirical and negative images, Surkov pointed out that it is impossible and harmful to attempt to prescribe some prescriptions on how to coordinate the dark and bright sides of the personality of the characters in the works or the social background. It is equally harmful to attempt to formulate the relationship between the advanced and backward things or the advanced and "ordinary" things in the image and character of the positive characters in literary works. As soon as it is formulated, it will immediately make the image and the work lifeless, and as a result, the persuasiveness of life itself will be replaced by forced sermons.

Surkov pointed out that in the past twenty years, especially in the post-war years, our writers have created images of great national activists and figures in science, art, and literature. In this regard, especially in drama and film works, the role of individuals in history has often been incorrectly and distortedly described.

The Party has pointed out to us the mission of Soviet literature:

"The task of Soviet literature is to help the country correctly educate young people, adapt to their needs, and educate the new generation to be energetic, believe in their own cause, not be afraid of obstacles, and be prepared to overcome any obstacles."

In order to gloriously complete this great historical task, our literature cannot take the road of creating "ideal characters" or creating images of "ideal personality."

If our literature embarks on this smooth road, there is a danger of rolling into the mud of bad fabrications, and there is a danger of replacing the recognition of living reality with fabricated "ideological loudspeakers" and forced sermons.

The strength of the image with which our modern young people compare their own destiny is based on profound life truth and on the development of the character of the characters according to the law of describing "typical characters in typical environments."

The reporter summarized the work of the past twenty years and pointed out with great joy and pride the road we have traveled. He said that we should take into account that during this period, we have carried out a cruel struggle against all kinds of resurgent alien ideological influences. In this struggle, literary workers have consistently relied on the strong and wise support of the Communist Party and the support of all sectors of Soviet society.

In the years between the two congresses, the reactionary theory of "art for art's sake" has reappeared. Often, attempts have been made under the banner of this false theory to detach literature from the sacred tradition of all the great writers in the world, especially the tradition of our own classical writers—the people's stance. In our environment, this means preventing literature from participating in the struggle of the Party and the people for our country's communist future.

The various resolutions adopted by the Party in 1946-1948 reminded us literary workers and workers in other art departments of the existence of this danger. The resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union helped us to unite our forces and jointly overcome the above-mentioned dangers.

Whether in the pre-war and post-war years, we also encountered the constant companion of "pure art," such as formalism that separates form from content, or naturalism that leads literature to the road of objectivism.

We must also attribute the tendency of cosmopolitanism to the extremely stubborn resurgence of alien reactionary influences. In the post-war years, the attack on cosmopolitanism was fiercely resisted, which is particularly understandable because the instigators of the "Cold War"—American imperialism—attempted to rule the world by economically, politically, and culturally annexing various nations and countries. Therefore, it is no coincidence that they used cosmopolitanism as the ideological basis for their outward expansion.

The fact that some articles published in the "New World" magazine before the convening of this congress were unanimously condemned by our literary and art circles proves that there may still be attempts to attack the basic stance of our literature from the nihilistic "pulpit" in the future.

We are loyal to the traditions of Soviet patriotism and proletarian internationalism, and we want to oppose poisonous cosmopolitanism—the abominable ideological system of warmongers. Any honest Soviet literary worker who has made mistakes of a cosmopolitan nature, whether he is a critic or a writer, as long as he corrects his erroneous stance, has the opportunity to work effectively and harmoniously with the big family of Soviet literary workers and work together to develop our country's literature.

The alien hostile tendencies that have appeared in literary practice and theory have repeatedly manifested themselves in the "left" criticism, which is the resurgence of the bad remnants of Proletkult tendencies and RAPP-style abuse. It is enough to mention the line taken by the criticism column of the "October" magazine since the activity of a "critic" like A. Belik to understand the stubbornness of this harmful tendency. In literary history and practical criticism, the "New RAPP tendency" is manifested in the repeated promotion of vulgar sociology, various primitive viewpoints, and so on.

Another vicious enemy that our literary circles must constantly fight against is bourgeois nationalism.

Surkov analyzed the activities of critics and literary figures and pointed out that although some large-scale works on the history of Russian literature and multi-volume sets on the history of British, French, German, and other countries' literature have been published, and serious monographs on the style, language, and writing skills of past great writers, critics, and classical writers have been published and are being published, the research on Soviet literary issues is much weaker.

Surkov pointed out that it is important to widely exchange opinions when commenting on a certain phenomenon or a literary work. We must eradicate this incorrect phenomenon: regarding any published book review as the final and non-appealable judgment on a literary work. The prestige of comments should be built on the critic's observation and depth of judgment, not on the publication of the article or comment itself. Surkov also talked about the need to raise the requirements for the artistic level of works. He talked about the harm of the so-called "conflict-free theory" that violates the laws of realistic development.

The reporter said that in order to activate this important part of literary work, the following measures must be taken first: resolutely strengthen the work of critics and literary researchers, enable the research institutes of the Academy of Sciences to more closely solve the major problems of summarizing the experience of modern literature, elaborate on literary theory and literary history issues in magazines and newspapers, and strengthen current criticism and book review issues, strengthen the work of the editorial departments of publishing agencies responsible for criticism and literary research, and establish a magazine specializing in the study of literary theory and literary history issues.

Soviet literature has achieved undoubtedly great achievements during the two congresses. These achievements do not exclude, but on the contrary, require the most rigorous and extensive analysis of the shortcomings that exist in Soviet literature. We have no right not to say on the stage of this congress that Soviet literature is lagging behind the requirements of our vigorously developing reality and lagging behind the strict requirements of the ever-growing readers. We should make strong and straightforward criticisms of the shortcomings of our literature, because our starting point is not nihilistic distrust of the potential of our literature, but the firm belief that our literature has such a talented team of writers and has reached such a level in creative experience and maturity that it will certainly be able to solve tasks that are more complex than those it has already solved and is solving.

The task of literature is to fully express all the virtues of the people of our era on the one hand, and to consciously and uncompromisingly criticize the capitalist remnants in people's thoughts and consciousness and all the shortcomings and chaotic phenomena in life on the other hand, in order to help form the character of communist builders.

The demands of the Soviet people, who are making history develop at such an unprecedented speed, for literature are urgent. They demand that literature more enthusiastically and timely reflect the issues that excite them. They do not regard writers as chroniclers who record the "year, month, and day" of their lives and struggles, but as their comrades and comrades-in-arms, as pioneers of the future—who enrich the builders with new ideas and open up new prospects for them.

Readers are not satisfied with the books we write, often because these books one-sidedly express the modern life of the Soviet Union, because many of us are not good at or dare not follow the tradition of our predecessors—classical writers, and often drown the characters in their own works with problems or materials, and dare not express the "subject" of people in development—that is, dare not describe the rich inner world of people in many aspects when the interests of society and individuals are consistent.

Readers of poetry and prose, audiences of drama and movies, demand that Soviet literature have works of various genres—novels, novellas, and short stories, epics, social lyric poetry and personal lyric poetry, tragedies and dramas, spicy satire and light life comedies. Readers have the right to demand that any work reach the level of their broad spiritual vision and the level of their extremely high requirements for the artistic quality of the work.

The practice of our literature firmly requires writers to more intensely delve into life. For a Soviet writer, taking a bystander attitude towards life is a wrong attitude. A Soviet writer is not an observer of events that occur in real life, that is, an observer of the material described in his works, but a participant in it. Taking a master's attitude towards social life is one of the manifestations of the writer's party spirit.

The Communist Party believes that literature is an active assistant in carrying out communist education for the masses of the people, a weapon in the struggle against the remnants of the old ideology, and a tool for spreading fresh things in life and the new character of the Soviet people. However, when solving tasks of a universal nature, we should pay special attention to discussing certain literary forms and genres separately, and the development of these forms and genres has a decisive effect on the improvement of the art forms associated with them. Writers should pay special attention to the creation of dramas and film scripts, and pay attention to the forms of poetry related to the creation of songs and music. Our backwardness in these areas is particularly obvious, which hinders the development of the most important and popular art forms. Drama, film, and songs have the characteristic that literary works can use them to spread extremely quickly and universally among millions of people.

As a social organization, the Writers' Association is the advocate of the Party's ideas in the field of literature and is the form of collective leadership of literature by writers. The Writers' Association, initiated by Gorky, played this role in the twenty years.

Before the convening of this All-Union Writers' Congress, writers' congresses were held in the federated republics, and writers' conferences were held in the states and border regions. At these meetings, more than 1,300 writers (more than one-third of all members of the Writers' Association) made reports, supplementary reports, and spoke in discussions in a truly democratic atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism.

Many speakers seriously criticized various aspects of the work of the Writers' Association, including organizational work. This criticism was often very severe, and its purpose was to resolutely correct the shortcomings and errors in its work in order to consolidate the Writers' Association.

The tasks that the literary world needs to solve collectively at the congress and after the congress are huge. To complete these tasks, the joint efforts of all Soviet literary workers are needed. Between the two congresses, the number of members of the Writers' Association has more than doubled. However, the proportion of new works has increased much less. Among the members of the Soviet Writers' Association, there are many who no longer engage in literary work.

In the period between the two congresses, many new people have entered the literary world. However, the average age of writers has after all increased by ten to fifteen years, and the proportion of young writers under the age of thirty has decreased a lot. This means that we are faced with the urgent task of attracting talented young people into the literary world. To this end, we should create conditions to both properly cherish young talents and put forward the strictest possible requirements for the quality of the works through which young people enter the literary world, and we must combine the two.

Our congress must especially emphasize the direct responsibility that the older generation of literary workers should bear for the future of our literature—that is, for cultivating young writers. Our literary workers should learn from Gorky's example and more generously pass on their experience to young people, and attract new people with talent into the literary world batch by batch.

The reporter finally said: The victory of Soviet literature and the massive spread of Soviet literary works at home and abroad mean that the new hero—the Soviet people—is triumphantly and victoriously marching in various countries around the world.

What Soviet writers should be concerned about first and foremost is to enrich this hero in literary works with the new characteristics and qualities cultivated among the people every day and every hour by the constantly developing Soviet life.

    关于苏联文学的现状和任务
    ——苏联作家协会委员会第一书记阿·苏尔科夫在第二次全苏作家代表大会上的报告（摘要）
    苏联作家协会委员会第一书记阿·苏尔科夫十二月十五日在莫斯科开幕的第二次全苏作家代表大会上作了“关于苏联文学的现状和任务”的报告。在报告的开头部分，他概述了第一次全苏作家代表大会以来的二十年间苏联文学发展的情形。
    苏尔科夫说，二十年以前高尔基在第一次全苏作家代表大会上说：
    “如果在这一大厅里奠立了联合全苏联的文学的基础，那么我们在代表大会以后就必须开始实际的联合，以便使我们艰巨的工作获得成绩，并且必须要继续这项工作，日益广泛地和日益深远地发展这项工作，以便建立伟大的文学，一个不但为我国所需要，为我国各族人民所需要，而且我敢说还为全世界所需要的文学。”
    二十年以来，苏联文学工作者在工作的时候都记住这位伟大的朋友和严厉的导师的赠言，并且感觉到自己是人类艺术天才所创造的全部文学遗产的合法继承者。
    苏联文学无论就其整个创作发展来说，或是就其优秀代表者的生活的道路来说，都是和人民有着密切联系的。苏联文学积极参加了社会主义的建设，参加了在我们向共产主义前进道路上发生的一切最重大的社会政治事件。
    苏联作家参加国内社会政治生活的积极性空前高涨了。一百五十位受到人民高度信任的作家被选为苏联最高苏维埃、各兄弟共和国最高苏维埃和地方苏维埃的代表。在过去的二十年中，苏联作家十分积极地参加了世界公众的一切最重要的进步运动。在第二次世界大战后的年代中，苏联作家成为世界范围的争取和平斗争的最积极的参加者。
    在两次代表大会之间的二十年当中，苏联的文学界发生了巨大的变化。文学界出现了新人，苏联作家协会的会员和候补会员的数目从一九三四年的一千五百人增加到一九五四年的三千六百九十五人。和第一次代表大会那时比较起来，文学界是巩固了，增加了新生力量，增添了新的作品。新的兄弟民族的文学产生了和发展了。随着拉脱维亚、立陶宛、爱沙尼亚、摩尔达维亚比萨拉比亚部分、布哥维那、外喀尔巴阡乌克兰、乌克兰和白俄罗斯西部各州的人民回归苏联怀抱，这些地方大批天才作家的新队伍加入了苏联文学界。
    文化革命的不断扩大和深入，使文学界增加了几千万新的读者。这些读者的出现，决定了文学作品发行的数目大大增加。
    从下列的数字中，可以明显地看出这种增加的情况。
      一九三四年，全国出版了一千八百五十二种俄罗斯苏维埃文学作品，共计三千二百九十四万三千册。而在一九五三年，出版了两千七百三十三种作品，共计一亿五千九百八十万零一千册。
    一九三四年，出版了苏联其他兄弟民族作家的作品一千二百三十三种，共计七百一十九万二千册。而在一九五三年，出版了一千五百五十二种作品，共计三千八百五十二万六千册。
    一九三四年，苏联出版了三百四十八种外国文学作品，共计四百七十九万七千册。而在一九五三年，印行了四百二十种作品，共计两千四百四十八万册。
    古典作品在我国特别广泛地流行。高尔基的作品出版了八千万册，普希金的作品出版了七千万册，托尔斯泰的作品出版了六千万册，契诃夫的作品出版了四千万册，屠格涅夫的作品出版了三千三百万册，果戈理的作品出版了两千九百万册，柯罗连柯、克里洛夫、莱蒙托夫、涅克拉索夫和萨尔蒂柯夫—谢德林等人的作品，出版数从一千六百万册到两千一百万册不等。
    许多外国作家的作品在苏联出版了一百万册到一千二百万册。这些作家是：巴尔扎克、儒勒·维恩、雨果、左拉、莫泊桑、西奥多·德莱塞、杰克·伦敦、马克·吐温、丹尼尔·德福、狄更斯、江纳森·斯威夫特、莎士比亚、海涅、哥德、席勒、塞万提斯等。
    除此之外，还应当补充说明，有四十七个俄罗斯苏维埃作家的作品在我国出版了一百万册到两千万册，其中包括九个诗人的诗集，而弗·马雅柯夫斯基的书籍出版了两千三百万册。
    如果我们考虑到在我们的国家中有三十多万个图书馆，由它们把书籍送到几千万读者手里这一事实，我们就可正确地了解到文艺作品读者的广泛性。
    苏尔科夫还谈到苏联各民族文学工作者之间的创造联系不断加强的情况。他说，这是我们党和国家的民族政策在文化方面获得胜利的最生动的证据之一。
    以前处在人人不识字的蒙昧状态中并且注定要灭种的许多小民族，在苏维埃政权下，它们新生起来过新的生活了。四十多个民族在十月革命之后第一次有了自己的文字。这些民族都创造了并且胜利地发展着自己的民族艺术和自己的文学。
    在各兄弟民族的文学中，题材范围无限地扩大了，对现代最重大的问题阐发更加深刻了，作家能够描写的生活现象的范围扩展了。
    苏尔科夫强调指出俄文在交流文化财富方面的重大作用。在共产党的英明的民族政策胜利的条件下，在我们社会中，俄文就担当了作为交流苏联各兄弟民族的文化和文学财富的强有力的工具这样一个光荣的作用。俄文的这一作用最近几年来更加强了，这是因为在国外读者对苏联各兄弟民族文学作家的作品的兴趣增长的情况下，这些作品往往是从俄文转译成许多外国文。
    他说，当然，每个兄弟民族的文学都按照自己的要求吸取了俄罗斯古典文学和苏维埃文学的经验。比较成熟的文学，如乌克兰文学、拉脱维亚文学以及一部分格鲁吉亚文学、亚美尼亚文学、阿塞拜疆文学在过去就有比较丰富的现实主义散文作品，在它们发展的苏维埃时期，它们一方面继承自己的民族传统，一方面融合俄罗斯古典文学和苏维埃文学的经验和传统，把这两者结合了起来。
    有些兄弟民族的文学则是另一种情况，它们的散文和戏剧作品到第一次全苏作家代表大会时甚至还处在萌芽状态。对这样的几十种民族的文学来说，俄罗斯的散文和剧作（当然，同时要利用世界文学的古典遗产）曾经是，现在也还是学习创造经验的主要的源泉。
    在两次代表大会之间的时期中，我国多民族文学发展的具有重大意义的结果之一，就是各兄弟民族文学之间日益增长的创造性的交互作用和互相影响。作家互相翻译彼此的作品的紧张工作，在这一方面起着很大作用。
    在这一时期，不仅是早已闻名的、就是初次进入我国人民文化生活领域中的各兄弟民族的古典文学作品，都及时地译成俄文和一些兄弟民族的语文，并且翻译的水平很高。
    现代苏联各民族作家的优秀作品翻译成俄文和其他各兄弟民族的文字的范围也扩大了。
    我们丝毫不轻视俄罗斯古典作家和现代俄罗斯文学的经验对所有各兄弟民族文学的发展所具有的意义，而同时也怀着对我们的共同成就的一种真诚自豪感，指出兄弟民族文学的古典作家的伟大创作和一些现代作家的优秀作品对包括俄罗斯文学在内的一切文学所产生的互相影响。
    苏尔科夫指出，许多著名的苏维埃作家参加翻译兄弟民族文学作品的工作，但有时也有才能薄弱的人参加这项重要的工作。
    第二次全苏作家代表大会应当严格责成新的作家协会委员会认真整顿翻译工作，把这项工作看作很重要的文化政治工作。
    苏尔科夫列举了一些数字和事实，说明外国读者对苏联文学的兴趣日益增长。
    在第一次全苏作家代表大会前，有九十七个苏联作家的作品被译成外国文。
    从一九四五年到一九五三年，据很不完全的统计，人民民主国家和资本主义国家出版了九百多个苏联作家的作品，共计有四十四种外国文字的译本，印行了九千多次。仅在一九五一年到一九五三年，外国就出版了九千四百一十九万六千册苏联文艺作品。由此可见，我国的文学是多么受外国读者的欢迎。当然，苏联文艺作品译本以在人民民主国家和人民中国流传最广。但是，在战后年代中，我国的书籍也冲破了“冷战”气氛，克服了横梗在我国文学和资本主义世界广大读者之间的障碍，在奥地利、英国、阿根廷、缅甸、巴西、荷兰、丹麦、印度、意大利、黎巴嫩、墨西哥、挪威、巴基斯坦、美国、乌拉圭、芬兰、法国、瑞士、瑞典、日本和其他许多国家中被翻译和出版了。
    由于增加了人民民主国家中数以千万计的读者和资本主义国家中成百万的读者，我国文学作品的读者数目增加了差不多一倍。
    我们应该时刻记住目前我国文学在世界各国文学中所占的特殊地位：它对外国劳动人民说来是光明、乐观思想和战斗力量的源泉，对外国先进和进步作家说来是创作经验的源泉。
    人民民主国家的文学家深刻注意一切有关我国文学发展史的问题，他们为了更深刻地了解如何在文学作品中具体体现社会主义现实主义方法，而对于一切能丰富他们在这方面的理解的东西都深感兴趣。因此，苏维埃国家每个文学家对自己的作品负有重大的责任。而每个批评家、理论家和作家在评论我国文学中的种种问题时，也对他们的每个字负有重大的责任。
    毫无疑问，我们的朋友、资本主义国家的进步作家对苏联文学的创作经验也是非常注意的。
    我们的朋友们的优秀作品中不仅包含着对现代资本主义活动进行尖锐和不妥协的批评的开端，而且也包含着体现了进步的、生活乐观的开端的那些思想、感情和形象。
    苏尔科夫接着谈到了苏联文学在伟大卫国战争年代中所起的作用。苏联各兄弟民族的作家在这个时期中是一支苏联爱国者的战斗队伍。在战争开始时，就有一千多个苏联作家（占苏联全体作家三分之一以上）自愿地加入了正在作战的陆海军的队伍。
    苏联作家活跃在伟大的卫国战争的一切战线上，他们手持武器或是携带前线记者的笔和笔记本，在黑海到巴伦支海的战线上，在英雄城的保卫者当中，在英勇的人民复仇游击队员当中，同英雄们和自己作品的读者们一起，走过艰苦的道路。
    我们永远庄严地怀念着阿·盖达尔、弗·斯塔夫斯基、尤·克雷莫夫、谢·吉科夫斯基、鲍·列文、米·楚曼德林、鲍·拉宾、扎·哈茨勒文、谢·谢苗诺夫、亚·阿菲诺盖诺夫、叶·彼得罗夫、杰·阿尔塔乌森、约·乌特金、奥·杰斯尼亚克、斯·图德尔、塔·古里亚、亚·加夫里利乌克、法·卡里姆和在伟大的卫国战争中牺牲的我们二百多名战友、各兄弟民族的作家的名字。
    苏联人民在战争年月中的伟大爱国高潮，在这些难忘的年月所创造的作品中，得到了英勇的、真实的和动人的反映。
    我国文学在战争中的命运和资产阶级文学“纯艺术”者的命运的对比，有如光明之于黑暗。当暂时得逞的法西斯威胁法国和英国存亡的年代中，只有最正直的民主文学家仍然是忠于自己人民的，其他为数很多的作家或者迁往外国以躲避伦敦和考文垂所遭到的夜间空袭，或者“闭门幽居”从而在实际上投降了奴役者，或者无耻地拿着自己的笔杆为侵略者服务。
    高尔基的热辣的政论的光荣传统，在伟大的卫国战争年月中，为大批的苏联作家所发扬光大。爱伦堡文章中的燃烧着的字句在苏联国内、国外千百万人民的心中至今不忘。戈尔巴托夫的诚挚和严正的“给朋友的信”至今读起来也不能不为之感动。吉洪诺夫和弗·维什涅夫斯基的日记和论文，使列宁格勒人在被围时期的困难和英勇的生活栩栩如生地重现在我们的眼前。瓦·格罗斯曼的优秀的特写，使千千万万人不仅了解，而且感觉到斯大林格勒保卫者的功绩的光荣。
    一九四二年夏天，当敌人迫近斯大林格勒的时候，萧洛霍夫的一篇热情奔放的短篇小说“仇恨的科学”在全国传诵着。在对苏联的战时文学作正确的评价时，不能不提到阿·托尔斯泰、亚·法捷耶夫、列·列昂诺夫、康·费定、维·伊凡诺夫、彼·巴甫连科、维·拉齐斯、德·萨斯拉夫斯基、维·斯塔夫斯基、康·西蒙诺夫、鲍·波列沃伊、布·加林、扬·苏德拉布卡恩、普·科查尔、凡·华西列夫斯卡、雅·加兰和其他苏联作家战时的政论和特写。
    十分遗憾的是，在战时以战争题材写散文和剧本的作家的经验没有批判地加以研究和总结。
    苏尔科夫接着提出了得到苏联广大读者好评的散文家、诗人、戏剧家、政论家——多民族的苏维埃文学的代表——的作品。苏尔科夫详细地谈到某些作家的创作方法，分析了他们的作品，说明苏联文学的思想性和艺术性的提高程度。
    苏尔科夫说，半世纪前列宁在“党的组织和党的文学”一文中写道：“文学事业最不能机械平均化，水准化，少数服从多数”，“在这个事业上无条件地必须保证个人创造性、个人爱好底广大原野，思想和幻想、形式和内容底广大原野”。
    列宁的这几句话已经为我国文学的全部发展过程证实了。列宁这几句话的意思是说，在制定社会主义现实主义的方法的总的方针下，可以容许各种不同派别存在，容许不同派别之间的创作竞赛，容许广泛地辩论各种派别的优点。
    作家尽管对生活现象和人的行为估价相同，但他们以艺术形象去表现他们各自所观察和感受的结果时，其方式的繁多是无穷尽的。按照“风格”、“韵律”、主题的处理方法，我们就可以准确无误地区别普罗科菲耶夫和谢尔温斯基，米尔夏卡尔和图尔森—扎杰的作品，但是，与此相反，我们却几乎没法感受得出当代西方现代主义者之间的区别，他们是千篇一律的，他们的“作品”的共同点是空洞无味、毫无内容，全是些没有个性的东西。
    苏尔科夫简要地总结了一下代表大会在这次举行以前进行的关于苏联文学中正面人物问题的讨论。他说，法捷耶夫、盖达尔、奥斯特洛夫斯基、波列沃伊的作品，伊林娜的“第四高度”（新华社编者按：中译本名“古丽雅的道路”），关于卓娅和马特洛索夫以及我们实际生活中的其他真正英雄的书之所以永远活在青年读者的心里，并且打动他们的心，是因为这些作品和那些梦想“理想的英雄”的书呆子的格言不同，它们都描写了我们同时代的活的人，描写了新特性、新道德、新的个人和社会关系准则不断形成的时代的人物。
    苏尔科夫在分析关于创造讽刺的、反面的形象问题时指出：企图就作品的人物个性或者是社会背景的黑暗面和光明面两者如何配合开出一些处方来，是不可能的，而且是有害的。企图把文学作品正面人物的形象和性格中先进的和落后的东西、或者是先进的和“平凡”的东西两者之间的对比关系公式化，也是同样有害的。只要一公式化，马上就会使形象和作品死气沉沉起来，结果就会以强迫命令式的说教代替生活本身的说服力。
    苏尔科夫谈到我们作家在最近二十年来，特别是在战后年代里所创造的伟大的国家活动家和科学、艺术、文学界人物的形象时指出，在这方面，特别是在戏剧和电影作品里面，对于个人在历史上所起的作用往往作了不正确的、歪曲的描写。
    党曾经向我们指出苏维埃文学的使命：
    “苏联文学的任务就在于帮助国家正确地教育青年，适应他们的需要，把新的一代教育成生气勃勃、相信自己的事业、不怕障碍、准备克服任何障碍的人。”
    为了光荣地完成这个伟大的历史任务，我们的文学不能走创造“理想人物”或者是创造“理想个性”的形象的道路。
    我们的文学走上这条光滑的道路，就有危险滚进恶劣的臆造的泥坑，就有危险以捏造“思想传声筒”和强迫命令式的说教来代替认识活生生的现实。
    我们现代青年人以自己的命运与之相比的那种形象的力量，是以深刻的生活真实为基础的，是以根据“典型环境中的典型性格”的描写法则来发展人物的性格为基础的。
    报告人总结了过去二十年的工作，十分高兴和自豪地指出我们走过的道路，他说，我们应当考虑到，在这个时期，我们跟形形色色的复萌的异己的思想影响进行了残酷的斗争。在这种斗争中，文学工作者一贯依靠共产党的坚强而英明的支持，一贯依靠苏维埃社会各界。
    在两次代表大会之间的年代中，“为艺术而艺术”的反动理论曾重新表现出来。往往有人企图在这种虚伪理论的旗帜下使文学脱离世界一切伟大的作家的神圣传统，特别是我们本国古典作家的传统——人民性立场，而在我们的环境下这就是要使文学不参加党和人民争取我国共产主义前途的斗争。
    一九四六—一九四八年间党所采取的各项决议，提醒我们文学工作者和苏联其他艺术部门的工作者这种危险性是存在的。苏联共产党中央委员会的各项决议帮助我们团结力量共同克服上述的危险性。
    无论是在战前和战后的年代中，我们还遇到“纯艺术”的始终不变的随身伴侣，如使形式脱离内容的形式主义，或者是使文学走上客观主义道路的自然主义。
    我们还必须把世界主义的倾向归到十分顽固地复萌的异己的反动影响之列。在战后的年代中，对世界主义的进攻，反击得很激烈，这是特别可以理解到的，因为“冷战”的发动者——美国帝国主义企图通过在经济上、政治上和文化上并吞各个民族和国家而统治世界，所以他们利用世界主义作为它向外扩张的思想基础，这不是偶然的。
    在这次代表大会召开之前，“新世界”杂志刊载的一些文章受到我国文艺界一致的谴责，这一事实证明了今后仍然有可能出现从虚无主义的“讲坛”进攻我国文学的基本立场的企图。
    我们是忠于苏维埃爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的传统的，我们要反对有毒的世界主义——战争煽动者的可恶思想体系。任何一个犯过世界主义性质错误的诚实的苏联文学工作者，不论他是批评家或者作家，只要他纠正自己的错误立场，都有机会跟苏联文学工作者的大家庭一起有成效地、和谐地进行工作，共同为发展我国的文学而努力。
    文学的实践和理论中出现的那种异己的敌对的倾向一再在“左”的批评方式中表现了出来，这种方式就是普罗文化派倾向和拉普式的谩骂的恶劣残余的复萌。只消提一下“十月”杂志的批评栏自从有像阿·贝利克这样一类“批评家”活跃起来以后所采取的路线，就也可以理解到这种有害的倾向的顽固性了。在文学史和实际的批评中，“新拉普倾向”表现为反复宣扬庸俗的社会学，各式各样的原始派观点等等。
    我们文学界所必须与之不断斗争的另一个凶恶敌人是资产阶级的民族主义。
    苏尔科夫分析了批评家和文学家的活动，指出，虽然已经出版了研究俄国文学史的一些巨著和关于英国、法国、德国和其他国家文学史的多卷集，已经出版了并正在出版研究过去的大作家、批评家以及古典作家的风格、语言、写作技巧的严肃的专论性著作，但是对苏维埃文学问题的研究要弱得多。
    苏尔科夫指出，在评论某种现象或某部文学作品时，广泛交换意见是很重要的。必须铲除这种不正确的现象：把任何一篇刊载出来的书评看成是对文学作品的最后的、不准上诉的判决。评论的威信应当建筑在批评家的观察力和论断的深度上，而不是建筑在文章或评论刊载出来这件事情的本身上。苏尔科夫还谈到必须提高对作品的艺术水平的要求。他谈到了违反现实发展规律的所谓“无冲突论”的危害性。
    报告人说，为了使文学工作这一重要部分活跃起来，必须首先采取下列措施：坚决加强批评家和文学研究者的工作，使科学院研究所更密切地解决总结现代文学经验的重大问题，在杂志上和报纸上阐发文学理论和文学史的问题以及加强当前的批评和书评等问题，加强出版机关负责批评和文学研究的编辑部的工作，同时创办一个专门研究文学理论和文学史问题的杂志。
    在两次代表大会期间苏联文学获得了无可怀疑的巨大的成就。这些成就没有排斥，相反地却要求最严格和最广泛地分析苏联文学所存在的缺点。我们没有权利不在这个代表大会的讲台上说苏联文学是落后于我们蓬勃发展的现实的要求的，是落后于不断增长的读者的严格要求的。我们应该对我们文学的缺点作强烈的和直率的批评，因为我们的出发点并不是虚无主义式地不信任我们文学的潜力，而是确信我们的文学拥有这样一支天才作家的队伍，并且在创作经验上和成熟程度上已经达到这样的水平：它一定能够解决比它已经解决了的和正在解决的任务更加复杂的任务。
    文学的任务就是：一面充分表现我们时代的人的一切美德，一面有意识地、毫不妥协地对存在于人的思想意识和心理中的资本主义残余、对生活中的一切缺点和混乱现象进行批评，用这种办法来帮助形成共产主义建设者的性格。
    使历史以如此空前的速度发展的苏联人对文学的要求是迫不及待的。他们要求文学更热烈地、更及时地反映激动他们的问题，他们不是把作家看作是给他们的生活和斗争注上“年、月、日”的编年史家，而是把作家看成是他们的同志和战友，看成是前途的开拓者——他以新的思想充实建设者，并且为他们打开新的远景。
    读者不满意我们写的书，常常是因为在这些书中片面地表现了苏联现代生活，因为我们有许多人不善于或者是不敢追随我们的前辈——古典作家的传统，而往往在自己的作品中用问题或材料淹没了人物，不敢在发展中表现“主体”的人——也就是说，不敢在社会利益和个人利益一致的情况下多方面地描写人的丰富的内心世界。
    诗和散文的读者、戏剧和电影的观众要求苏维埃文学有各种体裁的作品——长篇小说、中篇小说和短篇小说、史诗、社会抒情诗和个人抒情诗、悲剧和戏剧、泼辣的讽刺文学和轻松的生活喜剧。读者有权利要求任何一部作品达到他的辽阔的精神视野的水平，达到他对作品的艺术质量的极高的要求的水平。
    我们的文学的实际坚决地要求作家更加紧张地深入到生活中去。对一个苏维埃作家来说，对生活采取旁观者的态度，就是错误的态度。苏维埃作家不是现实生活中发生的事件的观察者、即他的作品所描写的那种材料的观察者，而是它的参加者。对社会生活采取主人翁的态度是作家的党性表现之一。
    共产党认为文学是对人民群众进行共产主义教育的积极助手，是同旧意识的残余进行斗争的武器，是传播生活中的新鲜事物和苏维埃人的新性格的工具。但是，在解决有普遍性质的任务的时候，我们应该特别单独提出某些文学形式和体裁来谈谈，这些形式和体裁的发展对与它们关联的艺术形式的提高有决定作用。作家应该特别注意戏剧和电影剧本方面的创作，注意那些和歌曲音乐的创作有关的诗的形式。在这些方面我们的落后情况特别明显，它妨碍最重要和最通俗的艺术形式的发展，而戏剧、电影和歌曲具有这样的特点：文学作品可以借助它们而极其迅速地、普遍地在千百万人民中传播开来。
    作为一个社会团体的作家协会是党的思想在文学领域中的鼓吹者，是作家集体领导文学的形式。高尔基倡议建立的作家协会在二十年过程中起了这种作用。
    在这次全苏作家代表大会召开以前，各加盟共和国举行了作家代表大会，各州和边疆区举行了作家代表会议。在这些会议上，一千三百多位作家（超过作家协会全体会员三分之一）在批评和自我批评的真正民主气氛中作了报告、补充报告和在讨论中讲了话。
    许多发言人严肃地批评了作家协会的各方面工作，其中包括组织工作。这种批评常常是很严厉的，其目的是为了坚决地纠正它的工作中的缺点和错误，以巩固作家协会。
    文学界需要在代表大会上和代表大会之后集体来解决的任务是巨大的。要完成这些任务，需要全体苏联文学工作者的共同努力。两次代表大会之间，作家协会会员的人数增加了一倍以上。但是新作品增长的比例却少得多。在苏联作家协会的会员中，有不少人已不再从事文学工作了。
    在两次代表大会之间的时期中，有许多新人进入文学界，然而作家的平均年龄毕竟是增加了十年到十五年，而三十岁以下的年青作家的比重已减少了许多。这就是说，在我们面前摆着把有才华的青年吸引到文学界的迫切任务。为此，应当创造条件，一方面对年轻的天才要妥为爱护，一方面对青年借以进入文学界的作品的质量要提出尽可能最严格的要求，要把这两者结合起来。
    我们代表大会必须特别着重指出老一代文学工作者对我们文学的前途——即对培养青年作家应负的直接责任。我们文学工作者应当学习高尔基的榜样，更加慷慨地把自己的经验传授给青年，将一切有天才的新人一批一批地吸引到文学界来。
    报告人最后说：苏维埃文学的胜利，苏维埃文学作品在国内外大量的传播就意味着新的英雄——苏维埃人胜利地凯旋地行进在世界各国。
    苏联作家应当首先关心的是：在文学作品里以不断发展的苏维埃生活在人们中每日每时培养的那些新特征和品质来充实这种英雄。
