Comrade Chairman! Dear comrades and friends!

The delegation of the German Democratic Republic attends this conference of peace-loving people with deep concern for the future of the German people and a sense of patriotic responsibility.

The reason why the delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic is attending this conference is the great danger posed to the German people by West Germany's re-militarization, due to Adenauer's signing of the Paris Agreements on October 23, 1954, which stipulate the incorporation of West Germany into the aggressive bloc formed by Western countries.

The Paris Agreements and attempts to rush through their ratification have created a new dangerous situation, which requires us to take swift measures to safeguard peace and resolve the German question.

We know that the countries around us have suffered the most from the ravages of barbaric Hitler fascism. For nearly ten years, the forces of peace and patriotism in our country have jointly carried out democratic and peaceful construction in the political, economic and cultural fields, and they have embarked on the path of peace and democracy in the German Democratic Republic. The majority of Germans have learned a lesson from historical experience, especially from the Second World War and its painful consequences for Germany: a new Germany, a democratic and peaceful Germany, must be built. Germany should never again be a threat to its neighbors. A unified and independent Germany should strive to be friendly with other countries and occupy its rightful place in the family of peaceful nations. The German people, for their own sake and for the sake of all peoples, demand peace. However, the Paris Agreements prevent a peaceful resolution of issues of vital importance to our country. The purpose of building a West German revanchist army and incorporating West Germany into an aggressive military bloc composed of certain countries against other European countries is to oppose peace and mutual understanding among peoples.

Ratification and implementation of the Paris Agreements will create obstacles to the peaceful reunification of Germany. The re-militarization of West Germany and its incorporation into aggressive blocs will hinder mutual understanding between the two parts of Germany. Someone wants to use the Paris Agreements to prohibit Germans from reaching mutual understanding on the issue of a unified Germany. Adenauer's party congress has openly declared its advocacy of a policy of establishing a barrier in the center of Germany. They want to maintain the division of Germany while permanently depriving Europe of peace. The re-militarization of West Germany and its participation in one-sided military blocs will lead West Germany down the path of war. Such a fatally dangerous development will bring serious disasters to the people of Europe, especially the German people. Someone wants to turn Germany into a battlefield. The strategic plans of the American occupiers and their West German partners stipulate turning West Germany into a zone of death. Regardless of the West German residents' fierce protests, they are burying mines under bridges and roads and preparing to blow up dams and mountain river banks (such as the Rhine and Ruhr rivers) in order to turn large tracts of land into a vast expanse of water within a few hours in the event of war.

West Germany now has American atomic cannons, which primarily threaten the lives and property of people in densely populated areas of West Germany. The old Hitler generals are now building a fascist "Bundeswehr" in West Germany again. They have also restored the "Steel Helmet" organization, which was an organization that overthrew the Weimar Republic together with the Sturmabteilung and the Schutzstaffel and helped prepare for the Second World War. In addition to the "German Soldiers' Federation" and the "Kyffhäuser League", there are about seven hundred organizations of various arms of service called "Traditional Associations". These "Traditional Associations" were the embryonic form of Hitler's "Reichswehr" during the Weimar Republic, and they are playing the same role in West Germany now.

In addition, an armed police force of 200,000 men, a so-called "Service Corps" of 250,000 men, and militaristic auxiliary organizations have been established. In this way, the imperialist million-strong army under the command of Hitler's generals is beginning to be built up. The Paris Agreements provide a direct possibility for West German militarists to openly establish a "Bundeswehr" and arm the "Bundeswehr" with the help of the United States.

There is no doubt that the reviving German imperialism will concentrate its economic, political and military forces to prepare for new predatory adventures. Responsible political figures in Bonn often openly say, "All areas where Germans have lived should be included in Germany's living space." Adenauer has shamelessly demanded that we no longer talk about German reunification. He said: "Wouldn't it be better if we said: liberate the East?"

They also want to instill this idea in German youth, wanting them to take up arms against their compatriots and brothers in eastern Germany. They want to use this premeditated fratricidal civil war as a prelude to invading the People's Democracies and the Soviet Union.

In order to reassure the public, some Western Europeans are spreading the notion that the resurrected German militarism is "less dangerous" now because it is under the control of the American Supreme Command. Leaving aside the fact that this is tantamount to inviting a wolf into the house, in fact, no one can believe that the so-called "constraints" and "controls" on German militarism will have any effect.

The history of German militarism shows that all attempts to "control" or "restrict" German militarism have failed. This will continue to be the case in the future.

In preparing and implementing their aggressive plots, German imperialists have always attached particular importance to the role of establishing one-sided military blocs. This has been proven by the two World Wars. Before the outbreak of the First and Second World Wars, one-sided military blocs were first established, extending throughout Europe and the world. The first was the Triple Alliance, which put up a smokescreen of peace, but its actual purpose was to ensure that German imperialism seized new markets and colonies. The formation of the Triple Alliance led other countries to organize the Entente. The establishment of the Triple Alliance was the main tool for preparing the First World War.

Twenty-five years later, under the guise of anti-communism, a new military alliance was established, namely the "Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Axis," which was a tool for launching the Second World War.

It is already very clear what terrible consequences the policy of establishing blocs has produced. Some say that the agreements signed in Paris would seem to eliminate the possibility of German militarism launching military adventures because it establishes a strict control system over German militarism and provides various guarantees, etc. However, no one who is aware of their responsibilities can believe this statement. In the past, there have also been attempts to restrain German militarism with various treaties, control mechanisms, and various guarantees, but all these plans have not worked.

In 1933, all of Krupp's factories were already 100% controlled by Hitler to implement his military plans.

The world war launched by Hitler's Germany caused the loss of 27 million lives. The total wartime expenditure and material losses were valued at US$1,350 billion.

History proves that when German militarism feels that its own strength is not strong enough, it is willing to issue peace declarations, conclude treaties, or undertake obligations to conceal its true plans, but once it has sufficient strength, it immediately treats its obligations as waste paper and stretches out its claws.

This fact was particularly evident during the fascist rule. In order to dominate the world, German militarism tore up a series of treaties and repeatedly violated international law.

There is no basis to believe that German militarism, rearmed within the framework of the Paris Agreements, will change its consistent attitude towards treaties and obligations. It will still violate treaties and adopt a policy of force and bloodshed.

German militarism is the deadly enemy of international peace, and it is also the deadly enemy of the German nation.

The Bonn regime is nothing but a government of revived German imperialism. The old representatives of imperialist policies have resurfaced in West Germany and are having an increasingly decisive influence on all aspects of life in West Germany. Fifty-four of the fifty-seven directors of the three major banks in West Germany held such positions during Hitler's rule.

The policies adopted by the three Western occupying powers have made West Germany's economic concentration far exceed the scale of the Hitler era. The notorious Krupp, Thyssen, Hoesch, Klöckner, Mannesmann-Röhrl Konzern determine the policies of West Germany's coal and metallurgical industries.

The "I.G. Farben" Konzern has been restored with a new face. The successor to "I.G. Farben" holds more share capital than the company's fixed capital during Hitler's era by 300 million marks. The existing capital of some successors of former German big banks has also increased several times compared with the Hitler era. On December 31, 1938, the total balance of the three big banks was 8.08 billion marks, while the total balance on December 31, 1953 had increased to 11.6 billion marks. Armament is a big business for them, enabling them to obtain more profits.

A small group of owners of Konzerns and monopolies have made huge profits and shifted the entire burden of re-militarization to the working people. The common people have already tasted the consequences of this. In order to pay for the huge expenses required for re-militarization, the prices of the most important foods and daily necessities continue to rise, rents, taxes and utility fees continue to increase, and real income is decreasing day by day, and the situation of the working people is deteriorating day by day. The income of 24 million workers and employees in West Germany is less than 200 marks per person per month, while according to Bonn's official statistics, the minimum living cost is 300 marks per month.

On the other hand, more than 80,000 people in West Germany earn more than 50,000 marks per year, meaning they receive a total of 4.1 billion marks from the national income.

Financial magnates squeeze profits and make a fortune, while the working people are becoming increasingly impoverished: this is the face of the Bonn state. Rearmament will make this situation even worse.

When the Bonn government signed the Paris Agreements, it promised to provide 600 million marks per month, and an additional 2.3 billion marks in the first twelve months after the treaty came into effect. This will further greatly reduce the living standards of West German residents. Therefore, the Bonn government has stepped up its attacks on trade unions that oppose this policy.

The revival of German militarism is firmly linked to the increasingly blatant dictatorship of militarists and revanchists in West Germany. The old imperialist, chauvinist, and militarist elements have now occupied the Bonn state apparatus. Eighty percent of the judges and prosecutors in West Germany were active members of the Nazi Party in the past, they supported fascism and its crimes, and some of them are now ready to take this path again. Following Hitler's example, the Adenauer regime is staging a trial in Karlsruhe, a replica of the Reichstag fire trial, and they are trying to use this trial to ban the German Communist Party and force the most determined fighters against German militarism to be silent.

Various fascist and militarist organizations receive state funding, while the Free German Youth League, which embodies the will of peace-loving German youth, is constantly persecuted in West Germany, its members are slandered, and they are thrown into prison.

The West German press does not hide the fact that the Bonn government is planning to take further measures to eliminate the little remaining democratic rights and freedoms of the West German people, especially to eliminate the trade union rights of workers.

The Bonn terror regime persecutes any German who advocates a peaceful method of achieving mutual understanding between the German people and who advocates establishing a unified, peaceful and democratic Germany.

When the so-called Federal Border Guard (a force prepared for civil war) conducts exercises, their openly stated purpose is to test their combat effectiveness in suppressing the just struggle of West German workers and West German trade unions. There is no doubt that after the establishment of the armed forces, the Bonn government will obtain a new tool of rule to suppress the people who demand peace and democracy.

The Bonn government is following Hitler's old path. It started with the terror persecution of communists, and now it is following up with measures to suppress trade unions. In order to prepare for aggression, Hitler established concentration camps in Germany and massacred tens of thousands of German patriots. Now Adenauer also wants to take this path. Adenauer's path, like Hitler's path, is a path to terror, massacre, and war.

According to the agreements signed in Paris, the Bonn government possesses so-called "extraordinary full powers," which entitle it to undermine the West German constitution at any time and implement dictatorial military and police measures in the event of so-called "disruption of order." And the Bonn government can describe any expression of opposition from West German residents to this destructive policy as "disrupting order." This clause of the Paris Agreements is reminiscent of Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which the German militarist forces used to plot the establishment of a fascist dictatorship. Now, the implementation of this dictatorial clause is a further step towards military dictatorship.

The Bonn militarists insist that the future German "Bundeswehr" is for defensive purposes, which deceives no one. The Bonn government's policy is clearly determined by "power politics," determined by the militaristic aggression goals of American and German imperialists. According to the Paris Agreements, the army placed under the control of the US imperialist Supreme Command can only serve the US plan to seize world hegemony.

History proves that the establishment of an army under the command of Hitler's generals is always used against peace and against the peace-loving and democratic forces of the people.

The "power politics" is doomed to failure from the beginning, because it violates the national interests of the German people, threatens the security of other countries, and is resisted by the people of the countries it threatens. The contrast of forces within Germany, as well as the contrast of forces worldwide, has changed in favor of the forces of peace.

The delegation of the German Democratic Republic believes that the participation of the German Democratic Republic, representing the peaceful democratic forces of the German people, in the European Conference on Safeguarding European Peace and Security itself proves that history will not repeat itself. The resistance of the West German people to the re-militarization plan shows that the American power politics pursued by the Bonn government is built on sand.

"Not a person or a penny to the Adenauer government!" "Fight to the end against Bonn's re-militarization!" Under such slogans, West German trade unions are fighting to implement the resolution of the Third Congress of the German Trade Union Federation and the Youth Representatives' Congress to reject re-militarization. Many West German industrial unions have stated that they will launch large-scale strikes once the Paris Agreements are implemented. German youth are particularly actively opposing re-militarization. Young people with various worldviews are uniting and taking direct action against the re-militarization policy under the threat of being drafted into military service. In West German cities, youth representatives are organizing committees against re-militarization and against conscription.

The fact that Adenauer's party lost many votes in the elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein, Bavaria, and Hesse proves the decline of Adenauer's influence and shows that the people are firmly opposed to the policies of the Bonn militarists and their American backers.

The Bonn government says, "Ratify first, then negotiate," it uses such words to block the road to negotiation and mutual understanding and takes the path to war. This is the policy of blackmailing by creating a fait accompli that Hitler used. If this does not work (which is impossible), then comes a "arm first, then negotiate", and finally "war first, then force surrender". The result of adopting this method was the unconditional surrender of Hitler's Germany itself.

The Adenauer government and the Americans who direct it behind the scenes insist that the Paris Agreements mean the end of the occupation and the restoration of West Germany's sovereignty. This is nonsense. Article 2 of the Paris Agreements states: "Taking into account the international situation, ... the three powers still retain the rights and obligations they have hitherto exercised or enjoyed in relation to Berlin and the whole of Germany, including restoring German unity and concluding a treaty of peace with Germany..."

It can be seen from this that someone wants to use the Paris Agreements to deprive the German people of their right to realize their own national unity. This has nothing in common with sovereignty, let alone the end of the occupation. Article 4 of the Paris Agreements states: "Before the agreement on Germany's contribution to defense comes into effect, the three powers still retain the rights they have hitherto possessed, namely, the right to station armed forces in the Federal Republic. ...The Federal Republic agrees that after the agreement on Germany's contribution to defense comes into effect, armed forces of the same nationality and number as the original armed forces may be stationed in the Federal Republic." It can be seen from this that Adenauer agrees to the occupation of West Germany until the end of this century. The Western countries also still retain all rights to use military force arbitrarily within West German territory.

The only correct way to resolve the German question is the Soviet proposal to immediately withdraw occupying forces from German territory.

Article 5 of the Paris Agreements talks about: the rights hitherto possessed or exercised to "protect the safety of the armed forces of Western countries stationed in the Federal Republic." Article 5 states: "In the future, the exercise of these rights will be limited to: exercise only after consultation with the Federal Republic, because the state of war does not preclude such consultation."

These clauses of the Paris Agreements will neither give West Germany freedom nor give West Germany sovereignty. These clauses are intended to permanently divide Germany, create obstacles to mutual understanding between Germans, and only ensure that German and American monopoly capitalists realize their plans for re-militarization. The right of the German people to solve their own affairs is the basis of sovereignty. Whoever does not allow the German people to use this right (as is the case in the conditions of the Western occupying countries) is not allowing the German people to be independent and autonomous.

The Government of the German Democratic Republic declares that the Paris Agreements, which stipulate the long-term occupation of West Germany and subject German residents to the control of the occupying countries, are a concrete manifestation of the colonial policy of insulting the dignity of the German people. The German nation has a long cultural tradition and has made great contributions to world culture.

The German nation is a great nation. Its inalienable right to establish a unified, democratic and peaceful country and to independently decide its own peaceful future must be realized immediately. The Western countries' policy of trying to prevent this historical development is creating an explosive political situation that hinders the creation of a peaceful environment in Europe.

The Paris Agreements have no legal effect because they violate the will of the majority of the German people and violate the national interests of the German people. The German people will never recognize the Paris Agreements and will do their best to prevent their implementation.

The Government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the German question should be resolved through peaceful and democratic means, so that the German people have the opportunity to freely develop their creativity and permanently eliminate this source of unrest in the heart of Europe.

Most Germans have learned a lesson from the Second World War and its very serious consequences for Germany. The lesson is: a new Germany, a peaceful and democratic Germany, must be built.

In a considerable part of Germany, effective preconditions for a peaceful resolution of the German question have been created. Due to the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the residents of eastern Germany have forever shattered the plans of American and West German militarists to try to force the entire Germany to accept militaristic oppression.

In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement of the four powers, in the German Democratic Republic, the foundations of militarism and revanchism have been eradicated. Due to the land reform, the elimination of monopoly capital and the confiscation of all the property of Nazi war criminals, the economic foundations of German militarism and imperialism have been eliminated in this part of Germany. The Constitution of the German Democratic Republic prohibits any war propaganda and prohibits racial persecution and revanchist policies. The people's vote held in the German Democratic Republic from June 27 to 29, 1954, fully demonstrated the residents' high awareness of safeguarding the cause of peace. A total of 93.6% of the residents voted against the Bonn and Paris military treaties, advocated concluding a peace treaty, and supported the peaceful restoration of our motherland's unity. The peaceful construction of the working people of the German Democratic Republic is a brilliant example for the working people of West Germany, because this peaceful construction points out the road to a happy life for them. In the German Democratic Republic, the German people have obtained basic democratic rights, they enjoy the right to work, the right to education, and the right to rest, and the basic rights of young people and women's rights have also been realized. The realization of all these rights has also been praised by the broadest working people in West Germany. In recent months, 75,785 West German residents have moved to the German Democratic Republic. The fact that more and more young people are moving from West Germany to the German Democratic Republic to participate in peaceful construction first shows that the German Democratic Republic has become a base for young people throughout Germany to carry out just struggles.

The German Democratic Republic has been able to achieve these achievements entirely due to the unity of the working class, due to the alliance of the working class with the working peasants, the close cooperation with the intellectuals and the petty bourgeoisie united in the bourgeois parties. The progressiveness of the new democratic system is embodied in the cooperation of various parties and mass organizations, embodied in the alliance of anti-fascist democratic parties, and embodied in the National Front of Democratic Germany. Due to this cooperation, the German Democratic Republic has become a reliable fortress for the German people to fight for peace, unity and democracy.

The proposals and propositions of the People's Chamber and the Government of the German Democratic Republic on safeguarding peace have been supported by the majority of residents in West Germany. Although Germany is divided, the working class and other peaceful democratic forces are jointly fighting against the revival of militarism, demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and the removal of such weapons from West Germany, and against turning West Germany into a military base for US and West German imperialist forces to carry out aggression.

The German Democratic Republic's struggle to defend peace is inextricably linked to the struggle to restore the unity of our motherland.

The People's Chamber and the Government of the German Democratic Republic realize that unifying Germany into a unified, peaceful, and democratic country is the most important task of the entire German people, and at the same time it helps to safeguard peace in Europe. Germany can only restore its unity as a peaceful, democratic country. Therefore, the struggle against the ratification of the Paris Agreements and against the revival of the West German "Bundeswehr" is the most important task that conforms to the interests of striving for German unity.

To reunify Germany, it is necessary to do everything possible to bring the two parts of Germany closer. For this purpose, the Government of the German Democratic Republic has suggested that the representatives of West Germany and us carry out closer economic cooperation, further develop internal German trade, implement cooperation in foreign trade, and implement close cultural cooperation, and do everything possible to promote such cooperation between national institutions and mass organizations of the working people. "Germans sit down at one table!" This is the consistent demand of the German people now and in the future.

Reunifying Germany is first and foremost a matter for the German people. Reunification is impossible without the representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany holding meetings together and reaching mutual understanding.

The People's Chamber and the Government of the German Democratic Republic have proposed holding joint meetings with West German representatives to discuss the reunification of Germany and the establishment of a peaceful, democratic country, especially to discuss the preparation and holding of free and democratic all-German elections. The Government of the German Democratic Republic has not put forward any preconditions for negotiations with West Germany. The Government of the German Democratic Republic is prepared to refer to the Weimar Constitution and use the good experience of the Weimar Republic when preparing to establish a unified, democratic German Republic, and to use the experience accumulated in national construction in East and West Germany after the war. Since an agreement can be reached on the conditions for elections in Vietnam at the Geneva Conference, this should also be possible for Germany. The Government of the German Democratic Republic believes that only all Germans can make decisions on the structure of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany. In order to ensure that they can freely express their opinions, representatives of the two parts of Germany must negotiate.

It is wrong for some people in West Germany to insist that the differences in political and economic systems between the two parts of Germany make it impossible to restore German unity. The Government of the German Democratic Republic believes that it is entirely possible now to organize the state organs, trade unions, and other mass organizations of the two parts to extensively exchange experiences on certain issues in economic life and on issues of preparing for a unified monetary system, on labor and social rights, and on the development of German culture.

The People's Chamber and the Government of the German Democratic Republic will do their utmost to support all efforts to reach an all-German agreement, because they know that if Germans can freely decide on major national issues, the warmongers will suffer defeat.

Hitler's generals and other militarists in West Germany insist that militarization seems to be only for "defensive purposes." This is not in accordance with the facts, just as the US government's assertion in the November 29 note that the German Democratic Republic is rearming is not in accordance with the facts. This is a lie, and no matter how many times it is repeated, it will not become a fact. This is exactly the means that Hitler once used to find excuses for his military build-up.

This statement by West German and foreign militarist elements has been refuted by the following facts: The Government of the German Democratic Republic has repeatedly proposed reaching an agreement on the number, deployment, and equipment of various police forces in East and West Germany, but the Bonn government has consistently rejected this proposal. We are willing to hold negotiations on this proposal at any time, and in addition, we have proposed inspecting the actual situation in this regard in the two parts of Germany.

The German militarist aggressor forces believe that they can use the establishment of the West German "Bundeswehr" and with the help of "power politics" to make the German Democratic Republic and the Eastern European countries submit to their rule. This is a replica of the "New European Order" policy implemented by Hitler. Everyone knows that this policy ended with the collapse of Germany. The above policy, like the Nazi policy, is bound to go bankrupt. Hitler's generals and other revanchist elements in West Germany will never be able to establish their rule in eastern Germany.

The Government of the German Democratic Republic cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that once the Paris Agreements are implemented, 520,000 West German troops equipped with the latest technology will appear on the western border of the German Democratic Republic, and this army will serve foreign and West German groups that have never concealed their aggressive intentions towards the German Democratic Republic.

The national interests of the German people, the interests of peace in Europe, and the interests of the residents of the German Democratic Republic all require the German Democratic Republic to be prepared to prevent the security of the German Democratic Republic from being infringed upon in any way, and to be able to repel any infringement.

The Government of the German Democratic Republic considers it necessary to declare at this conference:

Once West Germany has revived militarism and established a regular army, in order to respond to this action, the German Democratic Republic will have to establish national armed forces to protect the working people and peaceful achievements of the German Democratic Republic.

The delegation of the German Democratic Republic agrees with the views of the governments of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of Poland, and the Czechoslovak Republic expressed here by V.M. Molotov, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Józef Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Poland, and Viliam Široký, Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic: Once the Paris Agreements are ratified and implemented, the countries attending this conference should take joint measures to protect the peaceful labor of their people and their territory from infringement, to repel any aggression, and to safeguard peace in Europe. We also agree with the proposal of the Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic Viliam Široký: Once the Paris Agreements are ratified, the Czechoslovak Republic, the People's Republic of Poland, and the German Democratic Republic, which are particularly threatened, should reach an agreement on the issue of taking joint measures.

Taking such joint measures is in line with the national interests of Germany. Therefore, the delegation of the German Democratic Republic is prepared to discuss the issue of participating in the joint measures of peaceful countries at this conference.

I believe that the position taken by the Government of the German Democratic Republic on the issue of West Germany's re-militarization and dragging West Germany into the aggressive North Atlantic bloc will definitely be supported by the governments of all countries attending this conference.

The working people of the German Democratic Republic, with their own strength and ability, and with their will to build a happy new life, have achieved great achievements, and they will definitely be able to defend these achievements with all means in the future. The Government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the patriotic forces of the German Democratic Republic can expect the active support of the West German working class and peaceful forces in this regard. The representatives of West German youth have declared that they will never fight against the German Democratic Republic, the People's Democracies, and the Soviet Union. This statement proves that the force that will not be passive and will not allow German militarism to run rampant again is constantly growing.

The new situation in Germany now is that the working class, the working peasants, especially the youth, are increasingly launching struggles against West Germany's re-militarization. The policy of peace, unity, and democracy implemented by the German Democratic Republic and the National Front of Democratic Germany is actively supported by the broad working people in West Germany.

The People's Assembly and Government of the German Democratic Republic, as well as the majority of the German people, welcome the Soviet government's proposal to establish a collective security system including all European countries.

The Government of the German Democratic Republic firmly believes that this collective security system will also promote the peaceful reunification of Germany. Some people in West Germany insist that the revival of West German militarism is necessary to defend West Germany. A collective security system including all European countries will make this argument an empty word and will prevent the establishment of the West German "Bundeswehr," thereby removing the main obstacles on the road to peacefully restoring German unity.

A European collective security system is in line with the fundamental interests of the German people. A collective security system including all European countries will curb the threat of European division and will create the possibility of establishing peaceful relations and comprehensive economic cooperation. A collective security system including all European countries will ease international tensions and promote the solution of international problems such as universal international disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

The German Democratic Republic strives to maintain peaceful and neighborly relations with the peoples of all countries that advocate maintaining peace and good neighborliness, and this intention is in line with the German Democratic Republic's policy aimed at peacefully resolving Germany's vital issues.

The starting point of the Government of the German Democratic Republic is that it is practically possible for countries with different social systems to cooperate on the basis of equality and mutual respect.

The German Democratic Republic maintains friendly relations with the countries attending this conference and hopes to constantly develop this relationship. Friendship with the Soviet Union is particularly related to the vital national interests of all German people.

The German Democratic Republic's policy makes all German people deeply believe that Germany's peaceful development is inseparable from close friendship with the Soviet Union. Therefore, as our President Wilhelm Pieck said, Soviet-German friendship is increasingly becoming the vital cause of the German people.

The German Democratic Republic is firmly linked to the great peaceful democratic camp, which today has more than 900 million people, and its strength is growing day by day.

These countries are united by only one common goal: to meet the growing material and cultural demands of the working people and consolidate world peace through the development of all aspects of the national economy.

Therefore, their policy is fully in line with the interests of all peace-loving people.

On behalf of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, I am convinced that the decisions of this conference will help the German people to reunify Germany in a peaceful and democratic way and will safeguard the peaceful future of the German people.

The delegation of the German Democratic Republic declares that the German Democratic Republic will be with all the countries attending this conference, doing its part to strive for the victory of the just cause of safeguarding peace and security in Europe.

    十一月三十日在欧洲会议上
    格罗提渥的发言主席同志！亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    德意志民主共和国代表团怀着对德国人民的前途的深切的关心和爱国的责任感来出席这次爱好和平各国人民的会议。
    由于阿登纳一九五四年十月二十三日在规定把西德拉进西方国家组成的侵略集团的巴黎协定上签了字，由于西德的重新军国主义化，对德国人民造成了很大的危险，这就是德意志民主共和国政府代表团出席这次会议的原因。
    巴黎协定和有人想赶忙批准这个协定的企图形成了新的危险局势，在这种局势下，要求我们采取迅速的措施来维护和平和解决德国问题。
    我们知道，我们周围的国家是曾经受到野蛮的希特勒法西斯主义的祸害最甚的国家。我国的和平和爱国的力量将近十年以来在政治、经济和文化方面共同进行了民主和平的建设工作，他们在德意志民主共和国已走上了和平民主的道路。大多数的德国人从历史经验中，特别是从第二次世界大战和它给德国造成的惨痛后果中得出一个教训：必须建立一个新的德国，一个民主和和平的德国。德国应该永远不再成为它的邻国的威胁。统一和独立的德国应该致力于同其他国家友好而在和平国家的大家庭中占有它应有的地位。德国人民为了自己，为了各国人民，要求和平。但是，巴黎协定阻挠我们国家切身重要的问题获得和平解决。建立西德复仇主义军队和使西德加入由某些国家组成的反对其他欧洲国家的侵略性军事集团的目的是反对和平和各国人民的互相谅解。
    批准和实现巴黎协定将在和平统一德国的道路上造成障碍。使西德重新军国主义化和使西德加入侵略集团将妨碍德国两部分之间达成互相谅解。有人想用巴黎协定禁止德国人在统一德国的问题上达成互相谅解。阿登纳的党的代表大会曾经公开宣布主张实行在德国的中部建立一道壁垒的政策。他们想保持德国的分裂，同时长久地剥夺去欧洲的和平。西德的重新军国主义化和使西德参加片面的军事集团，将把西德引向战争的道路。这样一种有致命危险的发展将使欧洲人民、特别是德国人民遭到严重的灾难。有人想把德国变成战场。美国占领者和他们的西德伙伴的战略计划规定把西德变作死亡的地区。他们不顾西德居民激烈的抗议，在桥下和道路下面埋好地雷，准备把堤坝和山地河岸（例如莱因河和鲁尔河）炸毁，以便一旦发生战争，在几个小时以内就把大片的土地变为一片汪洋。
    西德现在有美国的原子炮，这种大炮首先威胁着西德人烟稠密地区的人们的生命和财产。旧日的希特勒将领现在又在西德建立法西斯“国防军”了。他们又恢复了“钢盔队”组织，这就是过去同冲锋队和党卫军一起推翻了魏玛共和国，并且帮助准备第二次世界大战的一个组织。除了“德国军人联合会”和“基夫霍塞联合会”以外，还有着约七百个名为“传统协会”的各种兵种组织。这些“传统协会”在魏玛共和国的时候曾经是希特勒“国防军”的萌芽，现在它们在西德也起着同样的作用。
    除此以外，已经建立了一支二十万人的武装警察部队，二十五万人的所谓“服务队”和军国主义的辅助组织。这样，希特勒将领统率下的帝国主义的百万大军就开始建立起来了。巴黎协定为西德军国主义者公开建立“国防军”和依靠美国的帮助武装“国防军”提供了直接的可能。
    没有疑问，复活中的德国帝国主义会在经济上、政治上和军事上集中力量准备进行新的掠夺性的冒险。波恩的负责的政治人物常常公开说，“凡是德国人住过的地区，都应当归入德国的生存空间之内。”阿登纳曾经毫不掩饰地要求不要再谈德国重新统一。他说：“如果我们说：解放东方，那不是更好吗？”
    他们还想把这种思想灌输给德国青年，要他们拿起武器来打德国东部的同胞和兄弟。他们想用这种预谋的、使德国人互相残杀的内战作为侵略人民民主国家和苏联的前奏。
    某些西欧人士为了安定民心，正在散布这样一种说法：现在复活德国军国主义“危险比较小”，因为它处于美国最高统帅部的管制之下。姑且不谈这样做等于引狼入室，事实上，谁也不能相信，所谓对德国军国主义的“约束”和“管制”会收到什么效果。
    德国军国主义的历史说明，所有“管制”或是
  “限制”德国军国主义的企图都失败了。今后也仍然只能是这样。
    德国帝国主义者在准备和实施自己的侵略阴谋时，一向特别重视建立片面军事集团的作用。这是两次世界大战所已经证明了的。第一次和第二次世界大战爆发之前，都是先建立起了范围及于欧洲和全世界的片面军事集团的。第一次建立的是三国同盟，它打出和平的幌子，实际的目的却是保证德国帝国主义夺取新的市场和殖民地。三国同盟的成立使得另一些国家组织了协约。三国同盟的建立是准备第一次世界大战的主要工具。
    二十五年之后，在反对共产主义的幌子下，又建立了一个新的军事同盟，也就是“柏林—罗马—东京轴心”，这是发动第二次世界大战的一个工具。
    大家都已经非常清楚，建立集团这一政策产生了什么样的可怕的后果。有人说，在巴黎签订的协定仿佛会消除德国军国主义发动军事冒险的可能性，因为它对德国军国主义建立了严格的管制制度，并且提供了各种保证等等。但是，任何一个意识到自己责任的人都不能相信这种说法。过去有人也曾企图用各种条约、管制机构和各种保证来约束德国军国主义，然而这一切打算都没有收到效果。
    一九三三年，克虏伯各工厂已经百分之百地被掌握在希特勒手里来实现他的军事计划。
    希特勒德国所发动的世界大战使两千七百万人丧失了性命。战争时期的开支总数和物资损失价值一万三千五百亿美元。
    历史证明，当德国军国主义感到本身力量还不够强大的时候，它愿意发表和平声明、缔结条约或承担义务来掩饰它真正的计划，但是，一旦它有足够的实力，它就立刻像对待一张废纸一样地对待自己所承担的义务而伸出魔掌来。
    在法西斯统治时期，这种事实表现得特别明显。德国军国主义为了称霸世界，曾经撕毁了一系列条约，一次又一次地破坏了国际法。
    没有什么根据可以认为在巴黎协定范围内重新武装起来的德国军国主义会改变它过去对待条约和义务的一贯态度。它仍旧会破坏条约，采用武力和流血政策。
    德国军国主义是国际和平的死敌，它也是德意志民族的死敌。
    波恩政权不是别的，就是一个复活了的德国帝国主义的政府。帝国主义政策的老代表重新在西德抬头了，而且对西德的全部生活发生着越来越具有决定性的影响。西德三大银行的五十七个董事中有五十四个是在希特勒统治时期就担任这种职务的。
    三个西方占领国所采取的政策使西德的经济集中远远超过希特勒时代的规模。臭名远扬的克虏伯、蒂森、赫尼尔、霍什、克鲁克纳、麦尼斯曼—罗伦康采恩决定着西德的煤矿和冶金工业的政策。
    “伊·格·法本工业”康采恩又改头换面地恢复起来了。“伊·格·法本工业”公司的继承者所拥有的股份资本比这家公司在希特勒时代的固定资本多三亿马克。一些前德国大银行的继承者的现有资本也比希特勒统治时期增加了好几倍。一九三八年十二月三十一日，三个大银行的结余总数为八十亿八千万马克，而一九五三年十二月三十一日的结余总数已经增加到一百一十六亿马克。武装对于它们说来是一笔大生意，使它们能够获得更多的利润。
    一小撮康采恩和垄断公司的老板取得了巨额的利润而把重新军国主义化的全部负担转嫁到劳动人民的身上。老百姓已经尝到了这方面的后果。为了支付重新军国主义化所需要的庞大开支，最主要的食品和日用品的价格不断上涨，房租、捐税和公用事业费不断增加，实际收入日益减少，劳动人民的处境日益恶化。西德二千四百万工人和职员每月每人的收入不到两百马克，而根据波恩官方的统计，最低生活费用是每个月三百马克。
    另一方面，西德有八万多人每人每年的收入超过五万马克，也就是说，他们从国民收入中一共得到四十一亿马克。
    金融巨头榨取利润，大发其财，而劳动人民日益贫困：这就是波恩国家的面貌。重新武装将使这种情况更加恶化。
    波恩政府签订巴黎协定时，答应每月拿出六亿马克，而在条约生效后最初十二个月内另外拿出二十三亿马克。这将使西德居民的生活水平进一步大大降低。因此，波恩政府加紧进攻那些反对这种政策的工会。
    德国军国主义的复活同军国主义和复仇主义分子愈来愈明目张胆地在西德进行独裁是牢固地联系在一起的。旧日的帝国主义、沙文主义和军国主义分子现在已经盘踞了波恩的国家机构。西德的审判官和检察官有百分之八十是过去纳粹党的积极党员，他们过去支持法西斯主义和它的罪行，并且其中有一部分人现在已经准备再走这条道路。阿登纳政权仿照希特勒的先例，在加尔斯卢合搞起一场审讯，一场国会纵火案审讯的翻版，他们企图利用这次审讯禁止德国共产党，并强使最坚决反对德国军国主义的战士不发言。
    形形色色的法西斯组织和军国主义组织得到国家经费的津贴，而体现爱好和平的德国青年意志的自由德国青年联盟在西德不断遭到迫害，它的盟员受到诬蔑，并且被投入牢狱。
    西德报刊并不掩饰，波恩政府正在计划采取进一步的措施以消灭西德人民仅剩的一点民主权利和自由，特别是要消灭职工的工会权利。
    波恩恐怖政权迫害任何一个主张用和平方法达成德国人民之间的互相谅解、以及主张建立一个统一的、和平的和民主的德国的德国人。
    所谓联邦边防军（准备用于内战的军队）在进行演习时，他们的公开目的是要考验他们镇压西德工人及西德工会正义斗争的战斗力。毫无疑问，建立武装部队之后，波恩政府就将获得一个新的统治工具，去镇压要求和平和民主的人民。
    波恩政府正在走希特勒的老路。它从对共产党进行恐怖迫害开始，现在接着而来的就是实行镇压工会的措施。希特勒为了准备发动侵略，在德国建立起集中营，屠杀了数万德国爱国者。现在阿登纳也想走这条路。阿登纳的这条道路和希特勒的道路一样，是通向恐怖、屠杀和战争的道路。
    根据在巴黎签订的协定，波恩政府拥有所谓
  “非常的全权”，这种“非常的全权”使它有权在任何时候破坏西德的宪法，在所谓“秩序破坏”时实施独裁的军警措施。而波恩政府可以把西德居民反对这种毁灭政策的任何表示说成是“破坏秩序”。巴黎协定的这种条款使人想起了魏玛宪法的第四十八条，当时德国的军国主义势力就是利用这一条策划建立法西斯独裁政权的。现在实行这种独裁的条款，就是进一步走向军事独裁的道路。
    波恩的军国主义者硬说，将来的德国“国防军”是用于防御的，这种话欺骗不了谁。波恩政府的政策显然决定于“实力政策”，决定于美国和德国帝国主义者的军国主义侵略目的。根据巴黎协定而被置于美帝国主义最高统帅部控制之下的军队，只能为美国夺取世界霸权的计划效劳。
    历史证明：建立希特勒将领指挥下的军队，总是用来反对和平、反对爱好和平和民主的人民力量的。
    “实力政策”从一开始起就已经注定了是要失败的，因为它违反德国人民的民族利益，威胁别国人民的安全，并且受到它所威胁的各国人民的反抗。德国内部力量的对比，也和全世界力量的对比一样，发生了有利于和平力量的变化。
    德意志民主共和国代表团认为，代表德国人民的和平民主力量的德意志民主共和国参加欧洲国家保障欧洲和平和安全会议这件事本身就证明，历史是不会重复的。西德人民对重新军国主义化的计划的反抗表明，波恩政府奉行的美国实力政策是建筑在沙滩上面的。
      “不给阿登纳政府一个人和一文钱！”“同波恩重新军国主义化斗争到底！”就是在这样的口号之下，西德工会在为实现德国工会联合会第三次代表大会和工会青年代表大会的拒绝重新军国主义化的决议而进行着斗争。许多西德产业工会表示，巴黎协定一旦实现，它们就要发动大规模的罢工。德国青年特别积极地反对重新军国主义化。具有各种世界观的青年在被征入伍服兵役的威胁之下，纷纷团结起来，采取直接行动反对重新军国主义化政策。在西德的城市中，青年代表已在组织反对重新军国主义化和反对兵役制的委员会。
    阿登纳的党在北莱因—威斯特伐利亚、石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因、巴伐利亚和黑森等州的选举中失去了很多选票，这证明阿登纳影响的下降，也表明了，人民在坚决反对波恩军国主义者和他们的美国后台老板的政策。
    波恩政府说，“先批准，然后再来谈判”，它用这样的话来堵塞谈判和互相谅解的道路，走上了通往战争的道路。这就是希特勒用过的、藉制造既成事实来实行威胁讹诈的政策。如果这样行不通（这是不可能行通的），接着就来一个“先武装，然后再来谈判”，最后就是“先战争，然后再强迫投降”。采用这一套方法的结果是，希特勒德国自己无条件地投降了。
    阿登纳政府和在幕后指挥它的美国人硬说，巴黎协定意味着结束占领和恢复西德的主权。这是胡说八道。巴黎协定第二条说：“考虑到国际局势，……三国仍然保留它们在对柏林和整个德国的关系上迄今所行使的或所享有的权利和义务，包括恢复德国统一和缔结对德和约……。”
    由此可见，有人想用巴黎协定来剥夺德国人民自己实现本国统一的权利。这同主权毫无共同之点，更谈不到结束占领。巴黎协定第四条说：“在关于德国对防御作贡献的协定生效以前，三国仍然保留它们迄今所具有的、即关于在联邦共和国驻扎武装部队的权利。……联邦共和国同意：在关于德国对防御作贡献的协定生效后，当时原有的同样国籍和数目的武装部队可以驻扎在联邦共和国。”由此可见，阿登纳同意西德被占领直到本世纪末。西方国家并且仍然保有在西德境内任意运用军事力量的所有权利。
    解决德国问题的唯一正确办法就是苏联关于从德国境内立即撤退占领军的建议。
    巴黎协定第五条谈的是：为“保卫西方国家驻扎在联邦共和国的武装力量的安全”迄今所具有的或执行的权利。第五条说：“今后行使这些权利的限度是：只有同联邦共和国进行协商后才能行使，因为战争状态不排斥进行这种协商。”
    巴黎协定的这些条款既不会给西德以自由，也不会给西德以主权。这些条款是要永久地分裂德国，造成德国人互相谅解的障碍，而且只保证德国和美国的垄断资本家实现他们重新军国主义化的计划。德国人民自己解决自己的事务权利是主权的基础。谁不让德国人民使用这种权利（西方占领国家的条件中就是如此），谁就是不让德国人民独立自主。
    德意志民主共和国政府声明：规定长期占领西德和让德国居民受占领国摆布的巴黎协定，是污辱德国人民尊严的殖民政策的具体表现。德意志民族有悠久的文化传统，它对世界文化有很大的贡献。
    德意志民族是一个伟大的民族。它的建立统一、民主和和平的国家以及独立决定自己的和平前途的不可剥夺的权利必须立刻实现。企图阻止这一历史发展的西方国家的政策造成爆炸性的政治局势，这种局势妨碍在欧洲创造和平环境。
    巴黎协定没有法律效力，因为它违背大多数德国人民的意志，并且违背德国人民的民族利益。德国人民绝不承认巴黎协定，并且要尽力来阻止它的实施。
    德意志民主共和国政府认为，应该通过和平和民主的途径解决德国问题，以便使德国人民有机会自由发展自己的创造力，并且永远消除欧洲心脏地带的这个动乱策源地。
    大多数德国人已经从第二次世界大战和它对德国十分严重的后果中得出教训。这个教训就是：必须建立一个新的德国，一个和平的、民主的德国。
    在德国的相当大的一部分地区已经为和平解决德国问题创造了有效的先决条件。由于德意志民主共和国的成立，德国东部的居民永远打破了美国和西德军国主义分子企图强使整个德国接受军国主义压迫的计划。
    按照四国波茨坦协定，在德意志民主共和国，军国主义和复仇主义的基础已经被铲除。由于进行了土地改革，由于消灭了垄断资本和剥夺了纳粹战犯的一切财产，在德国的这一部分，德国军国主义和帝国主义的经济基础被消灭了。德意志民主共和国宪法禁止进行任何战争宣传，禁止实行种族迫害和复仇政策。一九五四年六月二十七日到二十九日在德意志民主共和国举行的人民投票，充分表现了居民对保卫和平事业的高度觉悟。共有百分之九十三点六的居民投票反对波恩和巴黎军事条约，主张缔结和约，拥护和平地恢复我们祖国的统一。德意志民主共和国劳动人民的和平建设对西德劳动人民是一个光辉的榜样，因为这种和平建设向他们指出了幸福生活的道路。在德意志民主共和国，德国人民得到了基本的民主权利，他们享有劳动权、教育权和休息权，并且还实现了青年的基本权利和妇女权利。这一切权利的实现也得到最广泛的西德劳动人民的赞扬。在最近几个月中，有七万五千七百八十五个西德居民迁居德意志民主共和国。首先是越来越多的青年从西德迁居德意志民主共和国来参加和平建设，这个事实说明德意志民主共和国已成为全德青年进行正义斗争的根据地。
    德意志民主共和国能够取得这些成就，完全是由于工人阶级的团结，由于工人阶级同劳动农民的联盟，同知识分子和联合在资产阶级政党中的小资产阶级的亲密合作。新的民主主义制度的进步性体现在各党派和群众团体的合作中，体现在反法西斯民主党派的联盟中，体现在民主德国全国阵线中。由于这种合作，德意志民主共和国变成了德国人民为争取和平、统一和民主而斗争的可靠堡垒。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院和政府关于保障和平的建议和主张得到西德大多数居民的拥护。虽然德国处于分裂，但工人阶级和其他和平民主力量却正在共同进行斗争，反对复活军国主义，要求禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器并从西德除去这种武器，反对把西德变做美国和西德帝国主义势力进行侵略的军事基地。
    德意志民主共和国保卫和平的斗争同争取恢复我们祖国统一的斗争有密不可分的联系。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院和政府意识到，把德国统一成一个统一、和平、民主的国家是德国全国人民的最重要的任务，同时也有助于保障欧洲的和平，德国只有作为一个和平、民主的国家，才能恢复它的统一。因此，反对批准巴黎协定和反对复活西德“国防军”的斗争是符合争取德国统一的利益的最重要的任务。
    要德国重新统一，就要尽一切力量使德国两部分接近。为了这个目的，德意志民主共和国政府曾经建议西德的代表和我们进行更加紧密的经济合作，进一步发展德国内部的贸易，实行对外贸易方面的合作以及实行密切的文化合作，并且尽一切努力来促使国家机构以及劳动人民的群众组织实行这样的合作。“德国人坐到一张桌子上来！”这就是德国全国人民现在和将来的一致要求。
    重新统一德国首先是德国人民的事情。德意志民主共和国和西德联邦共和国的代表如果不在一起举行会议和取得互相谅解，恢复统一是不可能的。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院和政府曾经提议同西德代表共同举行会议，以便讨论德国重新统一和建立和平、民主的国家的问题，特别是讨论筹备和举行全德自由民主选举的问题。德意志民主共和国政府没有就同西德进行谈判提出任何先决条件。德意志民主共和国政府准备在筹备建立一个统一、民主的德意志共和国时参考魏玛宪法和利用魏玛共和国的良好经验，并且利用战后东德和西德在国家建设中所积累起来的经验。既然在日内瓦会议上能够就越南进行选举的条件达成协议，那么这对德国说来也应该是可能的。德意志民主共和国政府认为，只有全体德国人才能作出关于统一的、民主的、爱好和平的德国的结构的决定。为了保证他们能自由表示意见，德国两部分的代表必须进行谈判。
    西德的某些人士硬说似乎德国两部分政治和经济制度的不同使恢复德国的统一成为不可能，这种说法是错误的。德意志民主共和国政府认为，现在就已经完全有可能组织两部分的国家机关、工会及其他群众团体就经济生活方面的某些问题和准备统一币制方面的问题、就劳动和社会权利及发展德国文化方面的问题，广泛交流经验。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院和政府将竭力支持为达成全德协定而作的一切努力，因为它们知道，如果德国人能够自由地决定重大的全国问题的话，战争贩子将遭受失败。
    希特勒将领和西德其他军国主义分子硬说，军国主义化似乎只是为了“防御的目的”。这是不符合事实的，就像美国政府在十一月二十九日的照会中说德意志民主共和国在重新武装那种说法不符合事实一样。这是谎话，不管重复多少遍，它也不会变成事实。这正是希特勒曾经用来为他进行整军备战寻找藉口的手段。
    西德和外国军国主义分子的这种说法在下列事实面前已经不攻自破：德意志民主共和国政府再三提议就东德和西德的各种警察的人数、布置和装备达成协议，而波恩政府始终拒绝这种建议。我们愿意随时就这种建议举行谈判，此外，我们还提议在德国两部分检查现在这方面的实际情况。
    德国军国主义侵略势力认为，它们能够通过西德“国防军”的建立和藉助于“实力政策”来使德意志民主共和国和东欧国家服从它们的统治。这就是希特勒实行过的“欧洲新秩序”政策的翻版。大家都知道，这个政策是以德国的崩溃告终的。上面这种政策同纳粹政策一样，也必然会破产。西德的希特勒将领们和其他的复仇主义分子永远也不能在德国东部建立自己的统治。
    德意志民主共和国政府不能够对这样的事实熟视无睹：巴黎协定一旦实施，在德意志民主共和国的西部边界上就会出现五十二万拥有最新技术装备的西德军队，这支军队是为那些从来不隐瞒他们对德意志民主共和国的侵略企图的外国和西德的集团服务的。
    德国人民的民族利益、欧洲和平的利益和德意志民主共和国居民的利益，都要求德意志民主共和国有所准备，不让德意志民主共和国的安全受到任何侵害，能够击退任何侵害。
    德意志民主共和国政府认为有必要在这个会议上声明：
      西德一旦复活了军国主义和建立起正规军队，德意志民主共和国为了回答这种行动，就不得不建立保卫德意志民主共和国劳动人民和平成就的国家武装部队。
    德意志民主共和国代表团同意苏联部长会议第
  一副主席兼苏联外交部长莫洛托夫、波兰人民共和国部长会议主席西伦凯维兹和捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基在这里表示的苏联、波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国三国政府的意见：巴黎协定一旦批准和实现，出席这次会议的国家就应该采取共同的措施来保卫它们的人民的和平劳动和它们的领土不受侵犯，来击退任何侵略，来保障欧洲和平。我们还同意捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基的建议：巴黎协定一旦批准，特别受到威胁的捷克斯洛伐克共和国、波兰人民共和国和德意志民主共和国就要对采取共同措施问题取得协议。
    采取这种共同措施是符合德国的民族利益的。因此德意志民主共和国代表团准备在这次会议上讨论关于参加和平国家共同措施的问题。
    我相信，德意志民主共和国政府对西德重新军国主义化和把西德拖进侵略性的北大西洋集团的问题所采取的立场，一定会得到出席这次会议的各国政府的支持。
    德意志民主共和国的劳动人民用自己的力量和能力，凭自己建设幸福新生活的意志，已经取得了巨大的成就，他们今后也一定能够用一切手段保卫住这些成果。德意志民主共和国政府相信：德意志民主共和国的爱国力量在这一点上能够期望西德工人阶级和和平力量的积极支持。西德青年的代表曾经声明，他们永远不对德意志民主共和国、人民民主国家和苏联作战。这个声明证明，那种不会消极也不会让德国军国主义再度猖狂的力量正在不断壮大。
    现在德国的新情况是：工人阶级、劳动农民，特别是青年，日益展开反对西德重新军国主义化的斗争。德意志民主共和国和民主德国全国阵线实行的和平、统一和民主的政策得到西德广大劳动者的积极支持。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院和政府以及大多数德国人民欢迎苏联政府所提关于建立包括一切欧洲国家在内的集体安全体系的建议。
    德意志民主共和国政府坚信，这种集体安全体系也将促使德国和平地恢复统一。西德有些人物硬说复活西德军国主义是保卫西德所必要的。包括一切欧洲国家在内的集体安全体系将使这种论据成为无的放矢的空话，并且将阻止西德“国防军”的建立，从而扫除在和平地恢复德国统一的前进道路上的主要障碍。
    欧洲集体安全体系是符合德国人民的根本利益的。包括一切欧洲国家在内的集体安全体系将会制止欧洲分裂的威胁，并且将为建立和平关系和全面经济合作创造可能性。包括一切欧洲国家在内的集体安全体系将缓和国际紧张局势，促进国际普遍裁军、禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器等国际问题的解决。
    德意志民主共和国力求同所有赞成保持和平和睦邻关系的各国人民保持和平与睦邻关系，这种意图是符合德意志民主共和国所奉行的目的在于和平解决德国的切身问题的政策的。
    德意志民主共和国政府的出发点是：社会制度不同的国家在平等和互相尊重的基础上进行合作，是有实际的可能性的。
    德意志民主共和国同出席这次会议的国家保持着友好关系，并且希望经常不断地发展这种关系。同苏联的友谊尤其关系到全体德国人民切身的民族利益。
    德意志民主共和国的政策使全体德国人民深深相信，德国的和平发展是和苏联的亲密友谊分不开的。因而，正如我们的总统威廉·皮克所说的，德苏友谊日益成为德国人民的切身事业。
    德意志民主共和国同伟大的和平民主阵营牢固地联结在一起，这个阵营今天拥有九亿多人口，它的力量一天一天地壮大。
      把这些国家团结在一起的只有一个共同的目标：通过国民经济的各方面的发展，满足劳动人民日益增长的物质和文化要求，巩固世界的和平。
    因此，它们的政策完全符合于一切爱好和平的人们的利益。
    我代表德意志民主共和国代表团，深信这次会议的各项决定会帮助德国人民用和平民主的方法重新统一德国，并且会保障德国人民的和平前途。
    德意志民主共和国代表团声明：德意志民主共和国将同出席这个会议的所有国家在一起，尽自己的一分力量，争取保障欧洲和平和安全的正义事业获得胜利。　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科一日电）
