　　Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: Public opposition in Britain to the war cries of British Deputy Foreign Minister Nutting has grown increasingly strong. A United Press dispatch from London on the 14th stated: "The chief British representative to the United Nations has encountered a nationwide storm."

　　Following a motion submitted in the House of Commons on the 13th by six Labour MPs condemning and protesting Nutting's war cries, Labour MP Owen submitted another motion in the House of Commons on the 14th, formally requesting British Foreign Secretary Eden to make a statement to the House of Commons regarding the British government's policy on Taiwan. According to Reuters, such motions "are likely to gain increasing support."

　　Many newspapers have expressed unease about the British government due to Nutting's bellicose speech. The London "Times" said on the 14th, "No wonder Washington likes" Nutting so much. The newspaper said that Nutting's remarks would certainly make certain people in the United States feel "quite satisfied." The newspaper continued, "In view of the recent bilateral agreement concluded between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek (referring to the US-Chiang 'Mutual Defense Treaty'), this statement regarding British policy is all the more meaningful."

　　The British newspaper "Hong Kong Telegraph" in Hong Kong considered Nutting's remarks to be "foolish." It questioned: "If Britain helps defend Taiwan... then what will happen to Hong Kong?" The newspaper demanded that Nutting not act as "Lodge's speaking echo" for the US representative in the United Nations.

　　Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: London dispatch: A British Foreign Office spokesperson did not deny at a press conference on the 14th that the war cries made by British Deputy Foreign Minister Nutting represented the policy of the British government.

　　It is known that six Labour MPs have already submitted a motion in the House of Commons demanding condemnation of Nutting's remarks. Many British newspapers have also requested that the British government formally declare that Britain has not undertaken the obligation Nutting spoke of to participate in the American war of aggression against China. However, at the press conference on the 14th, when reporters asked whether "Nutting's remarks were a slip of the tongue or represented a new British policy," the British Foreign Office spokesperson did not answer, although he stated that the British Foreign Office had received the full text of Nutting's remarks and had exchanged views with Nutting via telegram.

　　When a reporter asked whether the British Foreign Office had reprimanded Nutting, the spokesperson denied that any reprimand had taken place.

　　Not only that, but the spokesperson also came forward to defend Nutting's remarks. He said: "Nutting meant that any hostile actions occurring in the Taiwan area are likely to escalate, and the United Nations, due to its responsibility worldwide, would therefore be involved." He even said: "The Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan are recognized by many United Nations member states, and the Kuomintang occupies China's seat in the United Nations."

　　The inevitable logical conclusion from the British Foreign Office spokesperson's remarks is that Nutting's line is also the British government's line.

　　Therefore, the assertion of the "Daily Express" correspondent in Washington appears to have considerable basis. The reporter wrote, "Before Nutting's remarks, few commentators dared to guarantee that Britain would help the United States defend Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan. And now, unless officially refuted, we are in the same boat as the Americans, who just twelve days ago signed a mutual defense treaty with Chiang Kai-shek."

### 英国公众强烈反对纳丁的战争叫嚣  英外交部发言人还出面为纳丁的无耻叫嚣辩解

    英国公众强烈反对纳丁的战争叫嚣
    英外交部发言人还出面为纳丁的无耻叫嚣辩解
    【新华社十五日讯】英国公众对于英国外交副大臣纳丁的战争叫嚣的反对已经越来越强烈了。合众社十四日从伦敦发出的消息说：“这位英国驻联合国的首席代表已经遇到了一场举国皆知的风暴。”
    在六个工党议员十三日在下院中提出了一项动议，谴责和抗议纳丁的战争叫嚣以后，工党议员欧文十四日又在下院中提出了一个动议，正式要求英国外交大臣艾登本人向下院就英国政府对台湾的政策发表声明。据路透社说，这类动议“大概会得到越来越多的支持”。
    许多报纸因为纳丁的好战演说而对英国政府表示不安。伦敦“泰晤士报”十四日说，“难怪华盛顿这样喜欢”纳丁了。这个报纸说，纳丁的谈话使美国的某种人一定会感到“颇为满意”。这个报纸接着说，“鉴于最近美国和蒋介石缔结的双边协定（按即美蒋“共同防御条约”）的情况下这个关于英国政策的声明就更加意味深长了。”
    在香港的英国人的报纸“德臣西报”认为纳丁的谈话是“愚蠢的”。它质问道：“如果英国协助保卫台湾……那么香港会有什么样的遭遇呢？”这家报纸要求纳丁不要在联合国内做美国代表“洛奇的发言的应声虫”。
    【新华社十五日讯】伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人在十四日记者招待会上并没有否认英国外交副大臣纳丁所作的战争叫嚣是代表英国政府的政策。
    大家知道，已经有六名工党议员在下院提出了动议，要求谴责纳丁的这种谈话。英国的许多报纸也要求英国政府正式声明英国并没有承担纳丁所说的参加美国对中国的侵略战争的那种义务。但是，在十四日的记者招待会上，当记者们问到“纳丁的谈话是说错了话还是代表英国的新政策”时，英国外交部发言人没有加以答复，虽然，他表示英国外交部已经收到了纳丁谈话的全文，而且已经在电报中和纳丁交换了意见。
    在有记者问到英国外交部是否已经斥责纳丁时，这个发言人否认有斥责这回事。
    不但如此，这个发言人还出面为纳丁的谈话辩解。他说：“纳丁的意思是，在台湾地区发生的任何敌对行动很可能扩大，联合国由于在世界范围内负有责任，因而将会牵涉进去。”他甚至还说：“台湾的国民党当局是为很多联合国会员国所承认的，并且国民党人占有中国在联合国的席位。”
    英国外交部发言人的谈话不可避免地导致的逻辑的结论是：纳丁的路线也就是英国政府的路线。
    因此，伦敦“每日快报”驻华盛顿记者的论断看来是有相当充分的根据的。这位记者写道，“在纳丁谈话以前，在评论家中很少有人敢担保说，英国会帮助美国保卫台湾的蒋介石。而现在，只要官方没有正式加以驳斥，我们就和十二天前刚刚同蒋介石签订共同防御条约的美国人一样了。”
