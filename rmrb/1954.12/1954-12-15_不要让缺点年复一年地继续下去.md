Don't Let Shortcomings Continue Year After Year
An Zhenqing, Director of the Sales Department, Coal Mine Management Bureau, Ministry of Fuel Industry

Since the People's Daily criticized the decline in coal quality of some state-owned coal mines in June 1953, mines have made some improvements in production and quality has improved, especially the Dattai Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau. However, some leading cadres of coal mines still have the one-sided idea of ​​pursuing output and neglecting quality assurance, so the phenomenon of poor coal quality has become more and more serious recently. According to the recent inspection by the Coal Quality Inspection Team of the Coal Mine Management Bureau and the feedback from consumer units across the country, the ash content and gangue mixed in coal produced by some coal mines have increased significantly.

The inspection materials show that many mining bureaus have not taken measures to ensure coal quality. For example, the Luozhuang Coal Mine even has the erroneous slogan of "three no inspections": "No inspection when it is windy, no inspection when there is a lot of water and coal, no inspection when the vehicle is not full," so the gangue content of coal in the first half of the year reached 3.8%, exceeding the national regulations. The result of the spot check on July 19 showed that the gangue content was as high as 11.9% and the ash content was 30%. The phenomenon of poor coal quality in the Jiawang Coal Mine is also quite serious. The inspection team found many large pieces of gangue in the coal of the Hanqiao Mine during the inspection. On July 5, a coal truck from the Xiaqiao Mine to the Xuzhou Railway Bureau even found a large piece of gangue weighing 52 kilograms. The inspection team inspected a coal car at 18:00 on August 21 at the Hongshan Mine in Zibo and found 300 jin of gangue in the coal, and even large pieces of gangue weighing 100 kilograms to 150 kilograms were transported from the well. During the inspection in Xinbo on August 17, 105 kilograms of gangue were detected in 635 kilograms of coal, with a gangue content of 16.5%. What is more serious is that some mines (such as Taozhuang, Jiawang, etc.) have mixed explosives and detonators in the raw coal. If these dangerous goods are not picked out, they will cause serious explosions when burned. Some coal mines (such as Fuxin, Shuangya, etc.) have very poor coal quality and also fabricate test reports, which has a worse impact.

The poor quality of coal in state-owned coal mines has caused great losses to the country. For example, if the ash content of coke used for coking increases by 1%, an iron-smelting furnace will use 2% to 2.3% more coke, limestone consumption will increase by 4%, and the capacity of the iron-smelting furnace will be weakened. If the ash content of coal used in industrial production and transportation increases and the coal quality is poor, it will have a great impact, either the quality of the products produced will be poor, or transportation delays will occur.

The main reason for the poor quality of coal is that the leading cadres of many state-owned coal mines have long held a one-sided view in their actual work that attaches importance to output, efficiency, and cost, and neglects quality. They do not comprehensively understand the inseparable connection between these four indicators, but mistakenly separate them, or even oppose them. They believe that completing the output is completing the task, emphasizing the difficulty of picking and choosing, and emphasizing the lack of screening and washing equipment. Therefore, they believe that the poor quality of coal is caused by objective conditions, and they do not actively think of ways, but just wait for equipment and investment, and do not realize the losses caused to the country and the people by the poor quality of coal.

For a long time, some state-owned coal mines do not discuss or rarely discuss quality issues, and there is no system to ensure quality at all, or if there is a system, it is extremely unsound and exists in name only. They do not conduct regular inspections of product quality, they do not regularly educate employees in depth to improve quality, and they do not establish or are unwilling to enrich the institutions and equipment necessary to ensure quality. In this case, the employees generally ignore quality, labor discipline is lax, and the result is that output increases, but quality gets worse day by day, and the losses to the country and the people are getting bigger and bigger.

Obviously, this situation of poor coal quality is absolutely not allowed to exist for a long time, and we must quickly take measures to improve it. We should mobilize the masses of employees to participate and improve coal quality together. Various methods can be used (such as holding exhibitions, soliciting users' opinions, making detailed accounts, conducting awards, etc.) to carry out publicity and education work, so that everyone can realize the harm of poor coal quality to national economic construction, national defense consolidation, and people's lives, and analyze the causes of poor coal quality, mobilize employees to find ways to improve mining methods, and strengthen gangue picking. At the same time, in order to ensure the improvement of coal quality, it is also necessary to establish and improve production management systems on the basis of mobilizing the masses, such as the level-by-level responsibility system, strict production inspection system, reward and punishment system, etc., to effectively overcome the phenomenon of no one being responsible.

Each mining bureau and mine must also take effective technical measures to improve coal quality. Mines that cannot add coal preparation machinery for the time being should organize manual sorting, and rationally stipulate the progressive wage for exceeding the quota of gangue sorting, learn the coal sorting method of the Didao Mine of the Jixi Mining Bureau, and improve the mining method of coal seams with more gangue, establish or strengthen the quality inspection work departments and laboratory work, etc. In order to improve coal quality, the sales organizations of each bureau and mine, which are attached to the financial department or the supply department, should establish a single sales office or section, directly under the leadership of the bureau director or mine director, and be responsible for supervising and inspecting coal quality. The People's Supervision Offices of each bureau and mine should also supervise and inspect the leading cadres who neglect coal quality. In short, improving coal quality is the responsibility of all coal mine staff, and everyone should actively participate in this work so that coal quality gradually meets national requirements.

    不要让缺点年复一年地继续下去
    燃料工业部煤矿管理总局销售处处长　安振卿
    自一九五三年六月人民日报批评部分国营煤矿的煤质下降问题后，各矿在生产中都有某些改进，质量有所提高，特别是京西矿务局大台矿的成绩更为显著。但某些煤矿的领导干部仍然存在着追逐产量不注意保证质量的片面思想，因而最近时期煤质低劣的现象又日趋严重。根据煤矿管理总局煤质检查组最近的检查和各地消费单位的反映，说明部分煤矿产煤的灰分和夹杂的矸石等都有大量增加。
    检查的材料说明：许多矿务局没有采取保证煤质的措施，像罗庄煤矿甚至有所谓“三不检”的错误口号：“刮风不检、水炭多不检、车不满不检”，因而上半年煤的含矸率达百分之三点八，超过国家规定指标。七月十九日抽检的结果，含矸竟达百分之十一点九，灰分达百分之三十。贾汪煤矿煤质不好的现象也相当严重，检查组在检查韩桥矿的煤中，发现有不少大块的矸石，夏桥矿七月五日运往徐州铁路局的煤车中，竟发现有重达五十二公斤的大块矸石。检查组在淄博洪山矿八月二十一日十八点检查了一车煤，发现煤中含矸石三百斤，甚至有一百公斤到一百五十公斤的大块矸石从井下运出来。八月十七日在新博检查时，在六百三十五公斤煤中，检出矸石达一百零五公斤，含矸率达百分之十六点五。更严重的是有些矿（如陶庄、贾汪等）原煤中混有火药、雷管。这些危险品如不捡出，燃烧时就会造成严重的爆炸事故。还有些煤矿
  （如阜新、双鸭等），煤的质量很不好，还假造化验单，造成的影响更坏。
    国营煤矿煤质低劣现象，给国家造成的损失是极大的。像炼焦用的焦炭，如果灰分增加百分之
  一，一个化铁炉就要多用焦炭百分之二到百分之二点三、石炭岩消耗要增加百分之四，炼铁炉的能力就要减弱。工业生产和交通运输业的用煤，如果灰分增加，煤质低劣，都会受到很大的影响，不是出产的产品质量不好，就是使运输发生晚点事故。
    煤质低劣的主要原因，是许多国营煤矿的领导干部，在实际工作中长期存在着一种片面的重视产量、效率、成本，忽视质量的观点。他们不是全面地来理解这四个指标之间相互不可分割的联系，而是把它们错误地分割开来，甚至对立起来。他们认为完成产量就算完成任务，强调拣选困难，强调没有筛选洗选设备，因此他们认为煤质低劣是客观条件所造成的，不去积极想办法，只是等待设备，等待投资，没有认识到煤质低劣对国家和人民所造成的损失。
    若干国营煤矿长期不讨论或很少讨论质量问题，根本没有保证质量的制度，或者有了制度也极不健全，形同虚设。他们不对产品质量进行经常的检查，他们不对职工经常深入地进行提高质量的教育，他们不去建立或不肯充实为保证质量所必不可缺的机构和设备。在这种情况下，职工们也就普遍忽视质量，劳动纪律松弛，结果是产量增加了，但质量却一天坏似一天，国家和人民的损失也愈来愈大。
    显然，煤的质量低劣的这种状况，是绝对不允许长期存在的，我们必须迅速采取措施加以改进。我们应当发动职工群众参加，共同来改进煤质。可以运用各种方式（如举办展览会，征求用户意见，算细账，进行奖励等），进行宣传教育工作，使大家认识到煤质低劣对国家经济建设、巩固国防及人民生活的危害性，并分析煤质低劣的原因，发动职工群众想办法，改进开采方法，加强检矸。同时，为了保证提高煤质，还必须在发动群众的基础上，建立并健全生产管理制度，例如逐级的责任制，严格的生产检查制，奖罚制度等等，切实克服无人负责的现象。
    各矿务局和矿井还必须采取有效的技术措施来提高煤质。一时无法添置选煤机械的矿厂应组织手选，并合理地规定选矸的超额累进工资，学习鸡西矿务局滴道矿的选煤方法，并改进夹矸石多的煤层的开采方法，建立或加强质量检查的工作部门和化验工作等。为了提高煤炭质量，各局矿的销售机构，附设于财务部门或附设于供应部门者，应成立单一的销售处或科，直接受局长或矿长领导，负责进行监督检查煤炭质量的工作。各局矿的人民监察室，对忽视煤的质量的领导干部，也应进行监督和检查。总之，提高煤的质量是煤矿全体工作人员的责任，大家都应当积极地来参加这个工作，使煤的质量逐步地达到国家的要求。
