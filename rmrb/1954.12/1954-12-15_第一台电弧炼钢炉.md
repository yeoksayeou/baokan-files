    The First Electric Arc Furnace
    Our country's first electric arc furnace was successfully trial-produced at the Xiangtan Electric Machinery Plant on December 10th. After inspection, its quality met Soviet standards. This electric arc furnace can refine high-grade quality steel such as stainless steel and tool steel to supply the needs of national defense industry and other large-scale industries.
    The electric arc furnace was manufactured according to Soviet design drawings. Its structure is very large, the furnace body weighing a total of twenty-nine tons and measuring four and fifty-three hundredths meters in height. It also has complete electrical control equipment. The manufacturing technology of the refining furnace is complex; even a hair's breadth deviation in the eccentric shaft would make it out of specification. The Xiangtan Electric Machinery Plant established a trial-production team for the electric arc furnace in mid-June, organizing more than 50 relevant technicians and workers to systematically study the Soviet drawings and first manufacture a small model to help the workers understand the drawings. During the construction process, engineers and technicians went deep into the workshops every day to provide guidance and solve problems in the work together with the workers, so that the trial production task was successfully completed.

    第一台电弧炼钢炉
    我国第一台电弧炼钢炉，已在十二月十日在湘潭电机厂试制成功，经过检验，品质达到苏联标准。这台电弧炼钢炉能炼不锈钢、工具钢等高级优质钢，供应国防工业及其它大工业的需要。
    电弧炼钢炉是按照苏联设计图纸制造的。它的结构非常庞大，炉身总重二十九吨，高四点五三公尺，还有成套的电器控制设备。炼炉的制造技术复杂，炉中的偏心轴差一根头发丝就不合规格。湘潭电机厂从六月中旬起成立了电弧炼钢炉试制组，组织有关技术人员、工人五十余人系统地学习苏联图纸，并先制造一小模型，帮助工人了解图纸。在施工过程中，工程师和技术员每天都深入工场指导，同工人一道解决工作中的困难，使试制任务顺利完成。
