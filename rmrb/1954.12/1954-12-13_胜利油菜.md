    Victory rapeseed, also known as Japanese rapeseed, is one of the better rapeseed varieties currently available. According to planting trial results in the Suining Special District of Sichuan Province, its yield greatly exceeds that of local rapeseed. In 1954, the average yield of ordinary rapeseed per mu in Suining Special District, Sichuan Province, was 105 jin, while Victory rapeseed's yield was 50% to more than threefold higher than that of ordinary rapeseed. The Victory rapeseed planted by the Special District Farm in this special district yielded an average of 243 jin per mu, which is more than double the yield of local rapeseed. The local rapeseed planted by the Pengxi County Farm yielded 87 jin per mu, while Victory rapeseed yielded an average of 309 jin per mu; the five mu and five fen and eight li of land with the highest yield produced 397 jin per mu, which is more than three times higher than the yield of local rapeseed. The average yield of Victory rapeseed planted by the Zunsheng and Beiba agricultural production cooperatives in Santai County was 300 jin per mu. This variety has the following advantages: (1) It is resistant to fertilizer, has uniform bolting, many branches, dense siliques, full seeds, consistent maturity, and high yield. (2) It has strong disease resistance. (3) It grows slowly in cold weather and only begins to bolt and bloom vigorously after the Beginning of Spring, thus avoiding frost damage. (4) The plant is medium-sized, with high and short branches, making it suitable for dense planting. (5) It is adaptable to a large planting area and is not affected by climate. (6) It contains ample oil and has an oil yield that is 3% to 5% higher than that of ordinary rapeseed.
    Because Victory rapeseed has so many advantages, farmers are generally happy to plant it. In addition, the Party and the People's Government have vigorously promoted and popularized it in recent years, and the planting area has increased year by year. This year, the nine state-owned farms in Suining Special District planted 393 mu of rapeseed, all of which is Victory rapeseed. This autumn, the promotion area of Victory rapeseed in Santai County has reached 70% of the total rapeseed area in the county, which is more than 43,000 mu. This autumn, the planting area of Victory rapeseed in the entire special district has been expanded to more than 120,000 mu, accounting for more than 40% of the total rapeseed area. The main experience in promotion is, on the one hand, to rely on state-owned farms, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid groups to take the lead in trial planting, using examples of increased production to demonstrate to the vast number of farmers; on the other hand, to actively publicize the advantages of Victory rapeseed to the masses, while combining this with the transmission of planting techniques. In this way, both thinking is cleared and technology is taught, and promotion is rapid.
    What issues should be paid attention to when planting Victory rapeseed?
    1. Deep plowing and fine preparation, timely sowing. Victory rapeseed is a taproot crop with long roots that absorb fertilizer over a wide area. Therefore, the field soil for sowing must be plowed deeply and prepared finely to make the soil loose and suitable for growth. According to the climate in Suining Special District, the best sowing time is from Cold Dew to the Beginning of Winter. There are two sowing methods: direct sowing and transplanting. Direct sowing is further divided into hill sowing and row sowing. Hilly areas with more sticky soil mostly use hill sowing, using 8 to 12 liang of seeds per mu; flat sandy loam areas mostly use furrow row sowing, using 6 to 8 liang of seeds per mu. The sowing depth is generally 2 to 3 fen. Before sowing, mix the seeds evenly in dry manure, then sow with the dry manure, and gently press down after sowing to ensure that the seeds are closely combined with the soil, facilitating the absorption of water and fertilizer. For direct-sown rapeseed, the first thinning should be done 15 to 20 days after sowing, the second thinning should be done 25 to 30 days after sowing, and the third thinning, which is the final thinning, should be done 35 to 40 days after sowing. Transplanting is carried out 30 to 40 days after sowing, and light manure water should be irrigated once after transplanting.
    2. Appropriate dense planting. This is one of the important methods to increase yield. Victory rapeseed has a moderate plant size, with high and short branches, making it more suitable for dense planting than ordinary rapeseed. However, the degree of dense planting must be determined according to the earliness or lateness of sowing; early sowing, high temperature, long growing period, good development, and taller plants with vigorous branching are suitable for a larger planting density. Late sowing, short growing period, small plant size, and few branches are suitable for a higher planting density. Experiments have shown that the density of spot-sown Victory rapeseed, sown between Cold Dew and Frost's Descent, should be a row spacing of one chi and a hill spacing of 4 to 6 cun, leaving 10,000 to 15,000 seedlings per mu. Sown between Frost's Descent and the Beginning of Winter, the row spacing should be one chi and the hill spacing 2 to 3 cun, leaving 15,000 to 24,000 seedlings per mu. For transplanting Victory rapeseed, the density should be single-plant dense planting or the "one-two-one" planting method (i.e., one plant in the previous hill, two plants in the next hill), with a row spacing of one chi and a hill spacing of 5 cun to one chi, planting 6,000 to 12,500 plants per mu.
    3. Focus on fertilization during the initial flowering period. Because Victory rapeseed grows slowly in the seedling stage, but grows very vigorously after bolting, and has a long flowering period, there must be an adequate supply of fertilizer in the later stage of rapeseed growth in order to ensure that the pods are full, the seeds are plump, the oil content is sufficient, and the yield is high. In 1954, Pengxi County Farm focused on fertilization during the initial flowering period, with an average yield of 397 jin per mu. Experience has shown that Victory rapeseed fertilization should be "light first, then heavy, less first, then more." Around the Beginning of Spring, when the rapeseed is bolting 4 or 5 cun and branches have appeared, the last "flower fertilizer" should be applied, accounting for 50% to 60% of the total topdressing, so that the yield can be significantly increased. The base fertilizer for Victory rapeseed should be dry manure or well-rotted compost. If the field soil is too dry, human and animal manure should be used as base fertilizer to ensure that there is an appropriate amount of moisture in the soil. If conditions permit, bone meal and phosphate rock powder can also be used as fertilizer. This type of rapeseed is high-yielding and fertilizer-tolerant, and the amount of fertilizer applied should be 30% to 50% more than that of ordinary rapeseed.
    In addition to the above main experiences to ensure increased production, attention should also be paid to appropriate irrigation, pest control, etc. Timely harvesting is also very important. Generally, harvesting should be done when the pods are apricot-colored. Harvesting too early will reduce the quality of the rapeseed, and harvesting too late will easily cause the pods to burst, affecting the harvest amount. During harvesting, attention should also be paid to selecting disease-free plants with long pods, green stems with white powder, and early maturity for seed retention. Victory rapeseed matures slightly later, while ordinary varieties are harvested earlier, but the seeds are not full enough; areas with the conditions should preferably set up appropriate seed retention land specifically for seed propagation to ensure the stability and improvement of Victory rapeseed yield.

    胜利油菜

    胜利油菜又名日本油菜，是目前较好的油菜品种之一。根据四川省遂宁专区种植试验结果，产量大大超过本地油菜。四川遂宁专区一九五四年一般油菜每亩平均产一百零五斤，胜利油菜比一般油菜的产量要高五成到三倍多。这个专区的专区农场所种的胜利油菜产量平均每亩二百四十三斤，比本地油菜产量约高出一倍多。蓬溪县农场本地种油菜每亩产八十七斤，胜利油菜每亩平均产三百零九斤；产量最高的五亩五分八厘地，每亩产三百九十七斤，较本地种油菜产量超出三倍多。三台县尊胜、北坝两个农业生产合作社种的胜利油菜每亩产量平均三百斤。这种品种有如下几个优点：（一）耐肥、抽苔整齐、分枝多、角果密、籽粒饱满、成熟一致、产量高。（二）抗病力强。（三）气候寒冷时生长缓慢，立春后生长转旺才抽苔开花，因而能避免霜雪为害。（四）植株中型，分枝高而短，适宜密植。（五）适应种植区域大，不受气候影响。（六）含油分充足，出油率较一般油菜高百分之三到五。
    由于胜利油菜有以上许多优点，农民多欢迎种植；加以党和人民政府几年来大力提倡推广，种植面积逐年增加。遂宁专区九个国营农场今年种油菜三百九十三亩，全部是胜利油菜。三台县今秋胜利油菜推广面积已达全县油菜总面积四万三千多亩的百分之七十。全专区今秋播种胜利油菜面积已扩大到十二万多亩，占油菜总面积百分之四十以上。推广中的主要经验是一方面依靠国营农场、农业生产合作社及互助组带头试种，以增产的事例向广大农民示范；另一方面积极向群众宣传胜利油菜的优点，同时结合传授种植技术。这样既打通思想，又教会技术，推广很快。
    种植胜利油菜应注意哪些问题？
    一、深耕细整，适时播种。胜利油菜是主根作物，根子长，吸收肥料范围宽广，因此播种的田土必须耕得深整得细，使土壤疏松，适宜生长。播种时间，根据遂宁专区气候，最好是在寒露到立冬，播种方式分直播和移栽两种；直播又分窝播和条播。山地粘土多采用窝播，每亩用种八两至十二两；平地沙质壤土多采取开沟条播，每亩用种六两至八两，播种深浅一般在两三分。播种前把种籽放在干粪中混合均匀，然后随干粪播下，播后轻轻压一下，使种籽与土壤密切结合，便于吸收水分和肥料。直播油菜第一次间苗在播种后十五天到二十天，第二次间苗在播种后二十五天到三十天，第三次间苗即定苗在播种后三十五天到四十天。移栽是在播种后三十天到四十天进行，栽后灌淡粪水一次。
    二、适当密植。这是提高产量的重要方法之一。胜利油菜株形大小适中，分枝高而短，较一般油菜更适于密植。但必须根据播种迟早决定密植的程度；播种早，气温高，生长期长，发育良好，植株较高大，分枝旺盛，种植密度宜大。下种迟，生长时间短，株型小，分枝少，密植程度宜高。试验证明：点播胜利油菜的密度，在寒露到霜降期间下种的，行距一尺，窝距四寸到六寸，每亩留苗一万株到一万五千株较合适。在霜降到立冬下种的，行距一尺，窝距二寸到三寸，每亩留苗一万五千株到二万四千株为宜。移栽胜利油菜的密度；采取单株密植或“一二一”的栽法（即前一窝栽一株，后一窝栽两株）以行距一尺，窝距五寸到一尺，每亩栽六千株到一万二千五百株较好。
    三、着重初花期施肥。因为胜利油菜在幼苗期生长缓慢，而抽苔以后生长特旺，并且开花期又长，所以在油菜生长后期要有充足的肥料供应，才能结实满尖，籽粒饱满，油分足而产量高。蓬溪县农场一九五四年着重了初花期施肥，每亩平均产量达三百九十七斤。经验证明，胜利油菜施肥应“先淡后浓，先少后多”，在立春前后油菜抽苔四、五寸，已出现分枝时，应着重施最后一次“?花肥”，其用量应占全部追肥量的百分之五十到六十，这样才能使产量显著提高。胜利油菜的底肥应用干粪或腐熟的堆肥。如果田土过于干燥，为了使土壤中有适量的水分，应用人畜粪尿作底肥。如条件许可还可配合施用骨粉和磷矿粉等肥料。这种油菜丰产耐肥，施肥量应较一般油菜增加三成到五成。
    除以上几项保证增产的主要经验外，还应注意适当灌水、防治虫害等。适时收获也很重要。一般在角果呈枇杷色时即应收获，过早会降低菜籽品质，过迟角果容易爆角影响收获量。在收获时还要注意选无病、角果长、茎秆青而有白粉，成熟早的植株留种。胜利油菜的成熟期稍迟，而一般的品种收获较早，籽粒却不够饱满；有条件的地区最好设适当的留种地专门繁殖种籽，以保证胜利油菜产量的稳定和提高。
