    Jining—Ulaanbaatar Railway
    Completion of the Main Track Laying Project of the Jining-Erlian Line
   【Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 11th】Railway workers constructing the Jining-Ulaanbaatar railway's Jining to Erlian section, after completing the laying of the Erlian station's tracks, continued laying tracks northwards at 5:20 PM on the 11th, reaching the Sino-Mongolian border, 4.8 kilometers from Erlian. When the track-laying train, adorned with a portrait of Chairman Mao and the national flag of the People's Republic of China, arrived at the Sino-Mongolian border, it sounded its whistle for ten minutes, and the workers jubilantly beat drums and gongs to celebrate the complete completion of the 338.7-kilometer main track laying project of the Jining-Ulaanbaatar railway within Chinese territory. The railway construction workers erected two large banners written vertically with "Respect to the Soviet People" and "Learn from the Soviet and Mongolian Railway Workers" on both sides of the railway.
    On the same day, all the staff and workers of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who built this section of the railway, sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao, reporting their railway construction achievements, and guaranteeing to complete the opening to traffic of this friendship artery between China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia in 1955.
   【Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 11th】By the end of November, the staff and workers constructing the Jining-Ulaanbaatar railway's Jining to Erlian section had completed 91.2 percent of this year's engineering plan. It is estimated that by the end of the year, 66.1 percent of the entire Erlian section project can be completed. Currently, in addition to the tracks already laid to the Sino-Mongolian border, the main line subgrade earthwork and bridge and culvert projects have been basically completed, and communication lines have also been erected to the terminal station, Erlian. From the start of full-scale construction on May 1st of last year to the present, the entire line's staff and workers have increased production and saved the country over 40 billion yuan in wealth.
    Over 170 kilometers of this railway section has already handled temporary passenger and freight transport. Mongolian herdsmen, who had never left the Xilin Gol grassland, have already begun to take trains to the city. They have not only seen operas and received medical treatment in the city, but also transported many years of stockpiled livestock products out by train. Herdsmen on the grasslands, who have always used cow dung as fuel, have also burned coal produced in the interior of the motherland for the first time since the railway. According to preliminary statistics from the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways up to the end of November, the freight volume has been over 30,000 tons in the half-year of handling temporary transportation. In November alone, more than 6,000 tons of surplus grain sold to the state by farmers of all ethnic groups along the line were transshipped.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Jining, 11th: The staff and workers of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who built the Jining to Erlian section of the railway, actively launched a technical innovation movement. In more than a year, a total of more than 1,500 rationalization proposals have been put forward. Of these, the part that can be calculated alone saved the country more than 8.4 billion yuan in wealth. The rationalization proposal put forward by Ding Wanchen, the head of the Second Engineering Section and winner of the Glorious Railway Worker Medal, enabled the engineering section to complete 600 meters of water pipes ahead of schedule, and cancel seven convenience lines and fifteen convenience bridges, saving the country more than 2 billion yuan in wealth. Li Zhongfang, a worker at the gravel plant, created a "bottom expansion blasting method" for stone excavation, increasing work efficiency by 15 to 20 times. Workers Shang Ruilin, Zhang Hai, and others, in cooperation with technicians, exerted collective wisdom and created the "high-line ash transportation method," which saved 40 cubic meters of wood by simply avoiding the construction of trestle bridges. When the railway stretched to the desert area and the subgrade construction encountered difficulties, worker Fu Mantang proposed the suggestion of digging clay next to the subgrade to protect the slope, so that the slope of the subgrade, which was several kilometers long, would no longer be destroyed by grassland storms, thus accelerating the progress of the project.

    集宁——乌兰巴托铁路
    集二线正线铺轨工程全部完工
   【新华社呼和浩特十一日电】修筑集宁—乌兰巴托铁路集宁到二连段的铁路职工，在完成铺设二连车站的站线以后，十一日下午五时二十分，继续向北铺轨到距离二连四点八公里的中蒙边境。悬挂着毛主席画像和中华人民共和国国旗的钉道列车到达中蒙边境时，汽笛长鸣十分钟，工人们欢天喜地地敲起锣鼓，庆祝集宁—乌兰巴托铁路在中国境内三百三十八点七公里的正线铺轨工程的全部完成。筑路工人们把两个竖写着“向苏联人民致敬”和“向苏蒙铁道职工学习”的巨大标语牌，竖立在铁路的两侧。
    当天，修筑这段铁路的铁道部第三工程局全体职工发出向毛主席致敬电，报告他们的筑路成绩，并保证要在一九五五年内完成这条中、苏、蒙友谊干线的通车任务。
   【新华社呼和浩特十一日电】修筑集宁—乌兰巴托铁路集宁到二连段的职工，到十一月底止已完成今年工程计划百分之九十一点二。预计到年底，集二段全部工程可以完成百分之六十六点一。现在，除路轨已经铺到了中蒙边境，正线路基土石方工程和桥涵工程都已基本完成，通讯线路也架设到终点站二连。从去年五月一日开始全面施工到现在，全线职工已经为国家增产节约了四百多亿元的财富。
    这段铁路已经有一百七十多公里地段办理了临时的客货运输。从来没离开过锡林郭勒草原的蒙族牧民们，已开始能坐火车到城市去。他们不仅在城里看到了戏，治疗了疾病，而且由火车把积压多年的畜产品运了出来。从来以牛粪为燃料的草原上的牧民，有了铁路后也第一次烧到祖国内地出产的煤炭了。据铁道部第三工程局到十一月底的初步统计，办理临时运输的半年多来，货运量已有三万多吨，仅在十一月份内，就转运了沿线各族农民出卖给国家的余粮六千多吨。
    据新华社集宁十一日电：修筑集宁到二连段铁路的铁道部第三工程局职工们积极开展技术革新运动。一年多来，共提出合理化建议一千五百多件，其中可以计算的部分，就为国家节约了八十四亿多元的财富。光荣的铁路工作者奖章获得者、第二工程段段长丁万臣提出的合理化建议，使工程段提前完成了六百多公尺的水管，取消了七条便线和十五座便桥，为国家节省了二十多亿元的财富。砂石厂工人李仲芳创造一种石方“底部扩大放炮法”，提高工作效率十五倍到二十倍。工人商瑞林、张海等和技术人员协同合作，发挥集体智慧，创造了“高线运灰法”，仅避免搭高架就节省了四十立方公尺的木材。当铁路伸展到沙漠地带，路基施工遇到困难时，工人傅满堂提出了在路基旁边挖出黏土来保护边坡的建议，使几公里长的路基边坡，再不会受草原暴风毁坏，因而加速了工程进度。
