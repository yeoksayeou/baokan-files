Hukou County is one of the high-yield areas for rapeseed, a major oil crop in Jiangxi Province. This year, the vast number of farmers in the county actively sold oilseeds such as rapeseed, sesame, and peanuts to the state, and expanded the planting area of rapeseed during the winter planting season. By November 21st, the county had purchased more than 500,000 jin of rapeseed, sesame, and peanuts, exceeding the original purchase target by 0.5 percent. In order to achieve self-sufficiency in oil and support national industrial construction, farmers in various townships and villages generally expanded the rapeseed planting area during the winter planting. As of November 21st, the county had planted 78,500 mu of rapeseed, accounting for 27.8 percent of the total winter planting area, an increase of 183 percent compared to last year's rapeseed planting area.

    湖口农民多卖油料多种油菜
    湖口县是江西省主要油料作物——油菜的高额产区之一。今年这个县的广大农民都踊跃地把油菜籽、芝麻、花生等油料卖给国家，并在冬种期间扩大了油菜的种植面积。到十一月二十一日，全县已经收购菜籽、芝麻、花生五十万多斤，超过原订收购任务百分之零点五。各乡、村的农民为了作到油料自给，并支援国家工业建设，在冬种中普遍扩大了油菜种植面积。到十一月二十一日止，全县已经种植油菜七万八千五百亩，占全部冬种面积的百分之二十七点八，比去年油菜种植面积扩大了百分之一百八十三。　（本报江西记者站）
