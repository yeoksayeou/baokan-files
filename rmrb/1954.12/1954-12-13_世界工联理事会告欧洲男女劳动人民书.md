World Federation of Trade Unions Council's Letter to the Working Men and Women of Europe

European working men and women, trade union members and officials:

At this crucial moment, when the forces of war are endangering the cause of peace and the safety of all nations, the World Federation of Trade Unions Council believes it is its sacred duty to appeal to all working people.

Dear worker friends! Today the security of Europe and peace throughout the world are under serious threat. After the failure of the "European Defense Community," the governments of the United States, Great Britain, France, and West Germany, as well as other countries, have signed the Paris Agreements. The purpose of these agreements is to revive German militarism and establish an aggressive army equipped with atomic weapons and commanded by a general staff composed of Nazi generals who were war criminals. This is the ugly truth of the reality.

Dear worker friends!

The signatories of the Paris Agreements insist that these agreements will help negotiations and create opportunities to ease international tensions. However, on the contrary, everyone knows clearly that the Paris Agreements will intensify the arms race. The ratification and implementation of these agreements will bring unprecedented poverty and subject the living standards, wages, and social welfare of working people to even more brutal attacks.

The London and Paris Agreements are agreements of arms dealers. The arms race only benefits the monopoly capitalists of the United States, West Germany, Great Britain, and France.

Monopoly capital intends to seize more profits by increasing the poverty of working people and re-militarizing. Their revival of German militarism is an attempt to pave the way for establishing anti-democratic dictatorial regimes in West Germany and Europe, destroying your rights and your trade union organizations.

Working men and women and trade union officials of all Germany!

We wholeheartedly salute the millions of Germans in East and West Germany who, together with their trade unions, are opposing the revival of German militarism. We call on you to thwart attempts to divide your ranks. Strengthen your unity and fight like brothers against the revival of militarism on your land, against the Paris Agreements, for the peaceful reunification of Germany on a democratic basis, and prevent the ratification of the Paris Agreements. If militarism prevails and a new war is ignited, you will be the first victims. You will be turned into cannon fodder, and your country will be destroyed.

Working men and women of France!

Do not let the sacrifices of the heroes of the Resistance be in vain. The heroic struggle of the French people has thwarted one attempt to revive the German Wehrmacht. Prevent the ratification of the Paris Agreements!

Prevent German divisions—this time equipped with atomic weapons—from reappearing on your eastern border.

Working men and women of Britain!

Do not let anyone deceive you, and do not let the blood shed by the soldiers of the last war in the campaign against the Nazis be shed in vain.

Do not let German militarists threaten British cities with the fate of Coventry again! Safeguard the independence and future of your motherland from the threat of German militarism. Strengthen your struggle for peace and friendly cooperation among nations!

Working men and women of all Europe!

Do not forget the dead, the cities bombed into ruins, the torture chambers, the incinerators! Do not allow the executioners to rearm and obtain atomic weapons. Do not let your lives and the lives of your loved ones, the fate of Europe's material and cultural wealth, be controlled by German militarists who have already committed countless crimes against humanity.

The united efforts of working people can build an insurmountable barrier in the path of war provocateurs. Strengthen the bonds of fraternal solidarity. The fact that West German trade unions belonging to the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" and East German trade unions belonging to the World Federation of Trade Unions are both opposed to the revival of German militarism clearly proves that it is possible to achieve the most irresistible unified action of trade union organizations on a domestic and international scale in this struggle.

Defeat the plan to revive the German Wehrmacht!

Organize protest rallies, gatherings, and demonstrations. Distribute leaflets and petitions, send delegations to parliaments and governments, demanding the rejection of the Paris Agreements. The fate of peace depends on you, on your struggle.

All countries—regardless of their social systems—can coexist peacefully. Fight for peaceful coexistence! Peaceful coexistence will pave the way for disarmament and reducing military spending. It will guarantee economic and social progress and greatly improve the welfare of all nations.

Demand the establishment of a pan-European collective security system!

Demand free economic cooperation between East and West! Consolidate international friendship!

We can become an invincible force by fighting in unity. Unite your ranks to wage a just struggle against the Paris Agreements and their consequences, for improving life in Europe, for the security of Europe and peace throughout the world.

The Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions
Warsaw, December 10, 1954

### 世界工联理事会告欧洲男女劳动人民书

专栏：

    世界工联理事会告欧洲男女劳动人民书欧洲男女劳动人民、工会会员和职员们：
    在这个关系重大的时候，战争势力正在危害和平事业和各国人民的安全的时候，世界工会联合会理事会认为，向全体劳动人民呼吁，是它的神圣的责任。
    亲爱的工人朋友们！今天欧洲的安全和全世界的和平受到了严重的威胁。在“欧洲防务集团”失败以后，美国、英国、法国和西德以及其他国家的政府已经签订了巴黎协定，这个协定的目的是复活德国军国主义，成立一支以原子武器装备起来的、并受由作为战犯的纳粹将军们组成的参谋总部指挥的侵略军队。这就是现实的丑恶的事实。
    亲爱的工人朋友们！
    巴黎协定的签订者硬说，这些协定将有助于谈判，并将为缓和国际紧张局势创造机会。然而，相反地每个人都清楚地知道，巴黎协定将加紧军备竞赛。这些协定的批准和实施，将带来空前的贫穷，并将使得劳动人民的生活水平、工资和社会福利受到更凶残的进攻。
    伦敦和巴黎协定是军火商的协定。军备竞赛只有利于美国、西德、英国和法国的垄断资本家。
    垄断资本打算用加甚劳动人民的贫困和重新军国主义化的办法来攫取更多的利润。他们复活德国军国主义，就是企图在西德和欧洲为建立反民主独裁政权来摧毁你们的权利和你们的工会组织铺平道路。
    全德国男女劳动人民和工会职员们！
    我们衷心地向在德国的东部和西部正同他们的工会一道反对复活德国军国主义的千千万万的德国人致敬。我们号召你们：挫败打算分裂你们队伍的企图。加强你们的团结，像兄弟般地一道进行反对在你们的土地上复活军国主义、反对巴黎协定、争取在民主的基础上和平统一德国的斗争，阻止批准巴黎协定。如果军国主义得势和燃起新战火的话，你们将是首先的受害者。你们将被变成炮灰，你们的国家就要被毁灭。
    法国的男女劳动人民！
    不要让抵抗运动英雄的牺牲成为徒然。法国人民的英勇斗争已经挫败了复活德国国防军的一个企图。阻止批准巴黎协定！
    阻止德国师——这次是要以原子武器装备起来的——在你们东部边界重新出现。
    英国的男女劳动人民！
    不要让任何人欺骗你们，不要让上次战争中的士兵在反对纳粹战役中所流的血成为白流。
    不要让德国军国主义者再度以考文垂的命运来威胁英国的各城市！保障你们祖国的独立和前途，使其不受德国军国主义的威胁。加强你们争取和平和各国间友好合作的斗争！
    全欧洲的男女劳动人民！
    不要忘记死难者、被炸为废墟的城市、刑室、烧人炉！不要允许刽子手们重新武装起来和得到原子武器。不要让你们的生命和你们所爱的人的生命、欧洲的物质和文化财富的命运为已经对人类犯了无法计算的罪行的德国军国主义者所掌握。
    劳动人民的联合努力可以在战争挑拨者的道路上树立起一道不能逾越的障碍。加强兄弟般团结的联系。属于“国际自由工会联合会”的西德工会和属于世界工会联合会的东德工会都在反对复活德国军国主义这一事实，清楚地证明了在这个斗争中是有可能在国内和国际范围内实现最势不可当的工会组织的行动的一致的。
    挫败复活德国国防军的计划！
    组织抗议大会、集会和示威游行。散发传单和请愿书，派遣代表团到议会和政府去，要求拒绝巴黎协定。和平的命运决定于你们，决定于你们的斗争。
    一切国家——不管它们的社会制度如何——都可以和平共处。为和平共处而斗争！和平共处将为裁减军备和减轻军费负担开辟道路。它将保证经济和社会的进步和大大增进各国人民的福利。
    要求建立一个全欧集体安全体系！
    要求东西方之间进行自由的经济合作！巩固国际友谊！
    我们团结一致地进行斗争，就可以变成一个不可战胜的力量。团结你们的队伍来进行反对巴黎协定及其后果、争取改善欧洲的生活、争取欧洲的安全和全世界的和平的正义斗争。
