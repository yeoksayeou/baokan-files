    A Chronicle of the Disaster Area in Fengtai County
    Xinhua News Agency reporters Gong Hao and Chu Shaobin
    Recently, we visited Fengtai County, the area in northern Anhui province that suffered the most severe flooding. In the biting north wind, we ascended Yuwang Mountain, where people had gathered to escape the floodwaters. Although traces of former cooking stoves could still be seen, the surrounding landscape had been transformed. An endless expanse of wheat, barley, rapeseed, broad bean, and other crop seedlings covered the fields like a green velvet carpet. Farmers at the foot of the mountain said, "After the flood, we lacked seeds, but the state transported them to us; we lacked farm tools, but blacksmiths and carpenters processed and rushed to make them for us; the shortage of draught animals can also be solved by mutual aid and cooperation organizations." Members of the Liu Wensheng mutual aid group in Liang'an Township explained to us how they overcame the difficulties of autumn sowing. They said, "After the flood, they had nothing. When they were worried about how to sow in the autumn, the state lent them various agricultural tools and hundreds of catties of wheat seeds according to their needs, and they sowed ninety-three mu of wheat." The mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives we visited were roughly the same. More than 1.5 million mu of land in the county has been completed in autumn sowing.
    When we visited Li Jialaozhuang in the Liu Ji District, poor peasant Li Jiashan warmly received us. His new house was built with the help of the local people's government, which transported wheat straw from Woyang and sorghum stalks from Hao County. He said with emotion: "In 1931, the flood washed away my only three houses. At that time, no one came to help. I had to carry my newborn son in a bamboo basket to escape the famine. It took two years before I barely managed to repair two rooms." This year's flood was a different story for his family. Because he participated in the mutual aid group, all of his more than 19 mu of land were planted with wheat. According to county officials, there are now more than 100,000 houses like Li Jiashan's that have been built with state assistance in Fengtai County.
    On December 3rd, reporters encountered a market fair in Maoji, Fengtai County. The snow had just stopped that day, and there were already many people at the fair. Here, there was no sign of anyone selling clothing and furniture out of desperation, but there were large quantities of fresh fish and shrimp, as well as household sideline products such as straw sandals and hemp ropes at the market. Most of the people selling these products were members of mutual aid groups or agricultural production cooperatives. After selling their by-products, they were buying what they needed.
    In order to accumulate grain for next year's spring plowing, the farmers in Fengtai County are very frugal, reducing their consumption of dry rice and adding some vegetables to their meals. During the autumn sowing in the Cheng Jiashu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gao Huang District, early-maturing vegetables are planted between wheat fields, so that these vegetables can be eaten next spring, and sorghum can also be planted. This will not only avoid affecting the wheat harvest, but also increase the amount of grain.

    凤台县灾区纪行
    新华社记者　龚灏　储少彬
    最近，我们访问了淮北最重的水灾地区——凤台县。在砭人肌骨的北风中，我们登上了人们为躲避洪水而集聚过的禹王山。这里虽还可以看到曾埋过锅灶的痕迹，但四处的面貌都变了。一望无际的小麦、大麦、油菜、蚕豆等等作物幼苗，像绿色的绒毡一样铺满了田野。山下的农民说：大水以后，我们缺种籽，国家给运来了；我们缺农具，铁木工人为我们加工赶制出来了；耕畜缺乏，有互助合作组织也能解决了。梁庵乡刘文胜互助组的组员向我们解释了他们如何战胜秋季播种的困难。他们说：大水以后他们什么也没有，正愁没法秋种的时候，国家根据他们的要求贷放了各种农具和几百斤麦种，播种了九十三亩小麦。我们访问过的互助组和农业生产合作社大致也都是这样。全县已有一百五十多万亩土地完成了秋季播种。
    在我们访问刘集区李家老庄时，贫农李家善热情地招待了我们。他住的新屋，就是当地人民政府从涡阳运来麦草，从毫县运来秫秸帮助他盖起来的。他感慨地说：“一九三一年，大水冲倒了我仅有的三间房子，那时候，没有谁来帮助，我只好把刚生下来的儿子用箩筐挑着出去逃荒。隔了两年，才算勉强修好了两间屋。”今年的大水中，他家是另外一个光景，由于参加互助组，十九亩多地全都种上了小麦。据县里的干部说，像李家善这样由国家帮助盖起来的房屋，现在凤台县已有十万多间了。
    十二月三日，记者在凤台县毛集，遇到了赶集。这天风雪刚刚停歇，集上已有不少的人。在这里看不到谁因生活所迫而出卖衣著和家具的现象，但在集场上有大量的鲜鱼鲜虾，还有草鞋、麻绳等家庭副业产品。出卖这些产品的人，大多是互助组的组员或农业生产合作社的社员。他们出卖了副产品，正在购买他们所需要的东西。
    凤台县农民为了积蓄明年春耕的口粮，他们很节约，减少了吃干饭，并在饭里掺着一些菜蔬。高皇区程家书农业生产合作社秋种中，在麦地间种早熟的菜蔬，明年春天就可吃到这些菜蔬，还可以播上秫秫。这样既不影响小麦收成，又能增加粮食。
