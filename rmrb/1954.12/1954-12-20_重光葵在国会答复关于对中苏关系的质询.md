Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch: Tokyo news: The issue of relations between Japan, the Soviet Union, and China continues to be a central focus of questioning by opposition parties in the Japanese Diet.

    At the Foreign Affairs Committee meeting of the House of Councillors on the 18th, opposition party members raised questions about the statement made by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov regarding relations with Japan. Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu continued to adopt a double-dealing approach in his responses. Regarding the issue of normalizing relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, he said that Japan "cannot immediately begin negotiations (with the Soviet Union) and does not intend to inquire about specific conditions from the Japanese side." He stated that he "will strive to obtain the understanding of the United States on the issue of improving relations between Japan and the communist camp."

    Shigemitsu said: "Although Japan has not restored diplomatic relations with communist countries, Japan will seize every opportunity to improve relations with them in a practical way." However, he added: "However, this does not indicate that there will be any changes in our relationship with the United States."

    Prior to this, news revealed that the United States had exerted pressure on Japan regarding Molotov's statement. Kyodo News, in a dispatch from Washington, quoted a threatening statement from a U.S. State Department official, saying that if Japan accepts the Soviet proposal to normalize Japanese-Soviet relations, "Japanese-American relations will deteriorate." Subsequently, Japanese newspapers revealed that officials responsible in the Hatoyama government had told U.S. Ambassador Allison that Japan would continue to be "loyal to the Japan-U.S. alliance."

    In answering questions about the relationship between Japan and China, Shigemitsu said: This relationship "depends on its (Japan's) relations with the United Nations, especially with the United States, and depends on the international situation." He indicated that if the international situation undergoes "drastic changes," Japan's relationship with the Chiang Kai-shek group in Taiwan "will of course change." However, he also stated that the Japanese government does not intend to consider changing its attitude towards China at present.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: Tokyo news: Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu has recently issued a series of statements and talks, explaining the Japanese new government's foreign policy. Shigemitsu has repeatedly emphasized that the Hatoyama government's main interest is "realistic diplomacy."

    Shigemitsu reiterated at a press conference on the 14th that the Hatoyama government will, like its predecessor, continue to emphasize "Japan-U.S. friendship." He said: The Hatoyama government will follow the general program of its predecessor.

    Shigemitsu's statement on the 11th regarding the Hatoyama government's foreign policy said that it is willing to restore normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and China on mutually acceptable terms. However, the statement also said that this adjustment of relations should "not impair our (Japan's) basic cooperation with free countries." Shigemitsu further explained at the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that Japan's relationship with China focuses on economic trade. He said: In order to expand trade with China, consideration is being given to easing past restrictions on the movement of trade personnel. However, Shigemitsu also emphasized that even trade with China cannot exceed the scope of Japan's "international obligations."

    Regarding the issue of restoring diplomatic relations with China, Shigemitsu said at the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on the 15th that because Japan maintains relations with the Chiang Kai-shek group, this issue must be considered from the "entire diplomatic point of view" of Japan. At the time, a member of parliament asked him whether he would continue to "respect" a letter written by former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida to U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on December 24, 1951, in which Yoshida "assured" Dulles that the Japanese government had "no intention" of concluding a "bilateral treaty" with China. Shigemitsu replied: He "did not know" about this letter.

    On the 16th, Shigemitsu also said at the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that the Hatoyama government "does not intend to recognize the Communist Chinese regime." Shigemitsu's statement was considered to contradict a radio address by Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama on the 15th, and therefore aroused questions from opposition party members. Hatoyama said in that radio address: "I am willing to establish relations with Russia and Communist China as soon as possible." Under questioning from members of parliament, Shigemitsu replied that "it is necessary to coordinate with the United Nations and other free countries, and there is no intention to recognize Communist China," but he also said: "In reality, a country called Communist China does exist." He believes that "promoting trade and practical relations with it (China) is correct," "as long as doing so does not harm the international obligations that we (Japan) undertake."

    Japanese newspapers, commenting on the ambiguity and contradictions in the Hatoyama government's foreign policy, said: The Hatoyama government's foreign policy is "speaking with two voices." The newspapers pointed out: Broad public opinion in Japan strongly demands the restoration of normal relations with China and the promotion of trade, so the Hatoyama government has made some promises about new policies towards China; however, when considering relations with the United States, the Hatoyama government has also offered assurances to the United States.

### 重光葵在国会答复关于对中苏关系的质询

    重光葵在国会答复关于对中苏关系的质询
    【新华社十九日讯】东京消息：日本和苏联、中国的关系问题，继续成为日本国会中在野党派对政府质询的中心。
    在十八日参议院外务委员会会议上，在野党议员就苏联外交部长莫洛托夫关于对日本的关系的声明提出了质询。日本外务相重光葵在回答时继续采取了两面说话的办法。关于日本和苏联关系正常化的问题，他说：日本方面“不能立即（和苏联）开始谈判，也不打算从日本方面询问具体条件”。他说：他“将就改善日本和共产党阵营的关系问题努力求得美国的谅解”。
    重光葵说：“虽然日本和共产党国家没有恢复外交关系，日本将要利用每一个机会以实际的方式来改善和它们的关系。”但他又补充说：“然而，这并不表示在我们和美国的关系上会有任何变化。”
    在这之前，有消息透露美国曾就莫洛托夫的声明对日本施加压力。共同社在一则发自华盛顿的消息中引一个美国国务院人士的恫吓说，如果日本接受苏联的使日苏关系正常化的建议，“日美关系就要恶化”。接着，日本报纸就透露，鸠山政府负责官员曾经向美国大使艾利逊表示，日本将继续“忠诚于日美联盟”。
    在回答关于日本和中国的关系问题时，重光葵说：这种关系“取决于它（日本）和联合国、特别是和美国的关系，取决于国际形势”。他表示：如果国际形势发生“急剧变化”，日本和台湾蒋介石集团的关系“当然会发生变化”。但他又表示，日本政府现在还不打算考虑改变它对中国的态度。
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：日本外务相重光葵最近接连发表声明和谈话，说明日本新政府的外交政策。重光一再强调，鸠山政府的主要兴趣是
  “现实外交”。
    重光十四日在记者招待会上重申，鸠山政府将像前任政府一样，继续着重“日美友谊”。他说：鸠山政府将同样遵循前任政府的一般纲领。
    重光十一日发表的关于鸠山政府的外交政策的声明说，它愿意在彼此可以接受的条件下恢复日本同苏联和中国的正常关系。但是，声明又说，这种调整关系要“不损害我们（日本）同自由国家的基本合作”。重光近日在众议院外务委员会进一步说明，日本同中国的关系，其重点在于经济贸易。他说：为了扩大对中国的贸易，正在考虑放宽过去对贸易人员往来的限制。但是，重光又强调，就是同中国进行贸易，也不能超出日本所负“国际义务”的范围。
    关于同中国恢复邦交的问题，重光十五日在众议院外务委员会说，因为日本同蒋介石集团保持关系，所以要从日本的“整个外交的观点”来考虑这个问题。当时有议员问他是否继续“尊重”前首相吉田茂在一九五一年十二月二十四日写给美国国务卿杜勒斯的一封信，在这封信中，吉田向杜勒斯
  “保证”，日本政府“无意”同中国缔结一个“双边条约”。重光回答说：他“并不知道”这封信的事。
    十六日，重光又在众议院外务委员会说：鸠山政府“不打算承认中共政权”。重光的这句话被认为和日本首相鸠山一郎十五日的广播演说有矛盾，因此，引起了在野党议员的质询。鸠山在那次广播演说中说：“我愿意尽早同俄国和共产党中国建立关系”。在议员的追问下，重光答复说，“要和联合国和其他自由国家协调，不打算承认共产党中国”，但是，他又说：“实际上，一个叫做共产党中国的国家确实存在”。他认为，“促进同它（中国）的贸易和实际关系是正确的”，“只要这样做不致损害我们（日本）承担的国际义务”。
    日本报纸在评论鸠山政府外交政策的含混和矛盾之处时说：鸠山政府的外交政策是“说两面话”。报纸指出：日本广大舆论强烈要求恢复同中国的正常关系和促进贸易，因此鸠山政府提出一些关于新的对华政策的诺言；但是，考虑到和美国的关系时，鸠山政府又向美国提出保证。
