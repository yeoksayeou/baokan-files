    -- Correspondence from the Kangzang Highway
    By our reporter Shen Shi

    The undulating peaks of the Taniantaweng Mountains stand like thousands of screens on both sides of the Nujiang River. The turbulent river rushes through canyons, skimming over cliffs, and pouring down into Yunnan.

    People on both sides of the Nujiang can see each other from the mountain tops, but to cross to the other side, they must climb over many high mountains. Only where there are zip lines can they cross the perilous Nujiang.

    Among the Tibetan residents around the Bangda Prairie on the east bank of the Nujiang, various legends are circulated.

    A young shepherd herded sheep on the east bank of the Nujiang every day. One day, melodious singing came from the opposite bank. He climbed up the hillside and saw a young girl herding sheep as well. The young shepherd couldn't help but sing loudly, and the girl on the west bank sang in response. From then on, the Nujiang River often rippled with mountain songs that rose and fell, conveying the thoughts and affections of the young people. The滔滔river patted the cliffs along the riverbank, hitting the boulders in the heart of the river, stirring up whirlpools, and splashing waves. How could the river, cliffs, and waves know the feelings of this young couple? It was like a natural barrier, blocking them and troubling them. As days passed, their desire to meet became more urgent. One day, they followed the path taken by wild goats down to the river. The boy swam across, but was swept away by the rapid current in the middle of the river. The young girl jumped into the water, wanting to save her beloved, but was also swallowed by the waves. The Nujiang still flows day and night, and the cliffs still stand on both sides of the Nujiang.

    From such myths, one can imagine how much the Tibetan people hope for a flat road in those mountains and a bridge over that turbulent river. The story is passed down from generation to generation, but the Nujiang still blocks the passage of travelers.

    Last July, the Kangzang Highway crossed the Bangda Prairie, spiraling down from the Yela (Mountain), which is more than 4,700 meters above sea level, directly to the Nujiang River. A certain division of the People's Liberation Army undertook the arduous task of building the project on both sides of the Nujiang River. The advance team crossed the turbulent Nujiang in rubber boats and reached the west bank. They erected zip lines and suspension bridges over the river, and the construction team crossed to the west side of the Nujiang. A certain engineering regiment was responsible for building a section of the project on the south bank of the Lengqu River, a tributary of the Nujiang. This section of the road was in an "unmapped area," with cliffs above and deep abysses below. The highway had to pass through this cliff to advance westward.

    Engineer Zhang Tianxiang, Staff Officer Zhang Jiliang of a certain unit, Tibetan cadre Congweng Dingzeng, and two others were ordered to find a way to reach this cliff in order to open a trail and allow the construction team to enter the work area.

    Zhang Tianxiang and his party of five crossed the Songbugongla Mountain from the west bank of the Nujiang and met a Tibetan youth herding sheep on the road. The young man came forward and asked, "Where are you from? Are you from the Liberation Army?" "We are from the Liberation Army, from the Nujiang River," Congweng Dingzeng replied.

    When the young man heard that they were from the Liberation Army, he volunteered to carry their backpacks and said, "Come and stay in our Zha Village!" As they walked and talked, Congweng Dingzeng asked him, "What is your name?"

    "Xiangbaluobu," the young man replied.

    "Xiangbaluobu! Is there a road to the mouth of the Lengqu River here?" Congweng Dingzeng said.

    "There is a road, let's talk about it after we get home," Xiangbaluobu said.

    When they arrived at Zha Village, the Tibetan people came to greet them, and they scrambled to ask the guests to stay in their homes. That night, Zhang Tianxiang and the others stayed at the home of Xiangbaluobu's uncle, Zhaxi.

    At night, they chatted with the Tibetan people. Congweng Dingzeng told them that the highway had been built to the Nujiang River and that a large bridge would be built across the Nujiang River. The highway would advance westward along the Lengqu River all the way to Lhasa.

    The Tibetan people laughed happily when they heard this.

    Congweng Dingzeng said, "We are sent to build the road, and now we need to find a way to get to the mouth of the Lengqu River. Please give us some advice, folks."

    "There is a road, there is a road, my uncle and I both know it," Xiangbaluobu said.

    "There is a road, but it is not easy to walk," Zhaxi said.

    "Even if the road is not easy to walk, we have to go," Congweng Dingzeng said.

    "That road is the one I used to take when I was hunting, it's all cliffs!" Zhaxi said.

    "No matter what the cliffs are, I am willing to lead the way," Xiangbaluobu said as he stood up.

    "What do you young people know? Tomorrow, we will both lead the way together," Zhaxi said.

    The Tibetan people all went home one after another, and Zhaxi, Congweng Dingzeng, Engineer Zhang, and others were still talking. Zhaxi told them to bring dry food, water, matches, and ropes before departure, and not to wear too thick clothes. Zhaxi asked Congweng Dingzeng: "There is thin mud on the road, and moss on the rocks. Climbing rocks, wearing Tibetan boots is not good, do you have rubber-soled shoes?" They gave Zhaxi a pair of rubber-soled shoes.

    Early the next morning, Zhaxi and Xiangbaluobu set off with them.

    Sometimes they advanced along the path taken by wild goats, and sometimes there was no such path, but Zhaxi still led them forward.

    "Zhaxi! There is no road here!" Congweng Dingzeng said.

    "Don't worry! Just follow me," Zhaxi said.

    It turned out that Zhaxi had marked the places he had passed when hunting with stones, and only Zhaxi knew such marks, and others could not figure them out. After walking about fifteen miles, they came to a very steep rock. Congweng Dingzeng said: "There is no way ahead, we can't get through." "Don't worry." Zhaxi said, looking for the marks he had made; in the crevices of the rock, he found the stones he had placed before, and looking down according to the marks, there was a slightly flat place under the rock, with a wooden stake inserted, which Zhaxi had also left when hunting. People slipped down the rock, stepped on the wooden stake, and could stand on their feet. They slipped down one by one, looked forward, and the Lengqu River was at the foot of the rock.

    Although they saw the Lengqu River, they still had to climb forward to find a way to the work area. Ahead was a cliff about three meters wide. Engineer Zhang said: "This section of rock is too difficult to walk, we have to dig it, otherwise, if we are not careful, we will fall into the river."

    "No need to dig, let's go around from above," Xiangbaluobu said.

    "You go around from above, I will go through here first." As soon as Zhaxi finished speaking, he grabbed a pine tree growing in the crevice of the rock with his left hand, and jumped to the other end of the rock. Then, Xiangbaluobu jumped over, and the others jumped over one by one, and Zhaxi supported them one by one.

    After walking for a while, there was another cliff. Zhaxi led them up a stone trough. The stone trough was very narrow, and they could not pass through wearing cotton clothes. At this time, the people traveling together realized how meticulously Zhaxi cared for them when he said not to wear too thick clothes. Engineer Zhang was over forty years old, and Zhaxi helped him whenever he reached a dangerous place while climbing the stone trough. They climbed to the top of the rock, from where they could see the foundation of the Nujiang Bridge and the work area of a certain engineering regiment.

    After a day of arduous trekking, they finally found a way to the Lengqu River work area.

    While they were exploring the road on the south bank of the Lengqu River, Cui Ximing, a platoon leader of a certain regiment, and soldier Zhang Renyi, regardless of the dangers, also found a way to the work area on the west bank of the Nujiang River on the cliffs of the west bank of the Nujiang River.

    The projects on both sides of the Nujiang River and the Lengqu River have started. Xiangbaluobu carried peaches, eggs, and vegetables, followed the path taken by the mountain goats, and climbed over many cliffs to the construction site of a certain engineering regiment. Congweng Dingzeng entertained him wholeheartedly, and the soldiers warmly welcomed him.

    Zhaxi, Xiangbaluobu, and the vast number of Tibetan people have personally experienced this tremendous change: a wide highway has appeared in the mountains, and a steel bridge has been built over the Nujiang River, which flows day and night. The aspirations of generations of people have now become a reality.

    带路的人
    ——康藏公路通讯
    本报记者　沈石
    他念他翁山脉起伏的峰峦，像千百座屏风，兀立在怒江两岸。奔腾的江水，穿过峡谷，掠过峭壁，一直泻到云南境内。
    怒江两岸的人，在山头可以相互看见，但要过到对岸，就得翻过重重高山，在架有溜索的地方，才能越过怒江天险。
    怒江东岸，邦达草原一带的藏族居民中，流传着种种传说。
    一个年轻的牧羊人，成天在怒江东岸放牧，一天，对岸传来了悠扬的歌声，他爬上山腰，看到一位年轻的姑娘，赶着羊群，也在放牧。年轻的牧羊人情不自禁地引吭高歌，西岸的姑娘也随着唱和起来。从此以后，怒江两岸经常荡漾着一起一落的山歌，山歌传送着年轻人的心思和爱慕。那滔滔的江水，拍打着江边的悬崖，撞击着江心的巨石，激起了漩涡，飞溅着浪花。江水、悬崖、浪花，怎么会知道这对青年男女的心情呢？它像一条天堑，阻隔着他们，苦恼着他们。日子久了，他们渴望会面的心情更加迫切了。一天，他们沿着野羊走过的路，下到江边。那少年泅水过去，浮到江心，被急流卷走，年轻的姑娘，跳到水里，想要捞救她心爱的人，也被浪花吞没了。怒江依旧在日夜的奔流，悬崖绝壁仍然耸立在怒江两岸。
    从这样的神话里，可以想像到藏族人民是怎样的希望那丛山峻岭中有一条平坦的路，在那湍急的江上有一座桥。故事一代一代地流传，怒江依然挡住来往的行人。
    去年七月，康藏公路穿过邦达草原，从拔海四千七百多公尺的业拉（山）盘旋下来，直达怒江沿岸。人民解放军某师担任修筑怒江两岸工程的艰巨任务。先遣队用橡皮船渡过湍急的怒江，到达西岸。他们在江上架好了溜索和吊桥，筑路队伍源源过到怒江西边。工兵某团负责修筑怒江支流——冷曲河南岸的一段工程，这一段路是“未测量区”，上有悬崖，下临深渊，公路必须通过这段悬崖，向西前进。
    工程师张天翔、某部参谋张继良、藏族干部聪翁丁增等五人，奉命找出一条通到这段悬崖的路来，以便开辟便道，使筑路队伍进入工区。
    张天翔等一行五人，从怒江西岸，翻过松布公拉大山，在路上碰到一个牧羊的藏族青年。那青年迎上前来，问道：“你们从那里来？是不是解放军？”“我们是解放军，从怒江边上来。”聪翁丁增回答说。
    那青年听说是解放军，争着要背他们的背包，还说：“你们到我们扎村去住吧！”他们边走边谈，聪翁丁增问他：“你叫什么名字？”
    “香巴罗布。”那青年回答道。
      “香巴罗布！这里有没有到冷曲河口的路？”聪翁丁增说。
    “路是有的，我们到家后再谈吧。”香巴罗布说。
    他们到了扎村，藏胞们都前来迎接，他们争着要求客人们到自己家中去住。那天晚上，张天翔等就歇宿在香巴罗布的叔父扎喜家里。
    夜里，他们找藏胞们漫谈，聪翁丁增告诉他们：公路已经修到了怒江边上，将在怒江两岸架起一座大桥，公路将沿着冷曲河西进，一直修到拉萨。
    藏胞们听了，高兴得笑起来。
    聪翁丁增说：“我们是派来修路的，现在要找一条通到冷曲河口的路，请老乡们多出主意。”
      “有路，有路，我和叔父都知道。”香巴罗布说。
    “路是有的，只是不好走。”扎喜说。
      “路即使再不好走，我们也得去一趟。”聪翁丁增说。
    “那条路还是我从前打猎走过的，都是悬崖绝壁哩！”扎喜说。
    “不管是什么悬崖绝壁，我愿意领路。”香巴罗布边说边站起来。
    “你年轻人知道什么？明天我们两人一道去领路。”扎喜说。
    藏胞们都相继回家去了，扎喜和聪翁丁增、张工程师等还在谈天。扎喜告诉他们，出发前，要带干粮、水、火柴和麻绳，衣服不可穿得太厚。扎喜问聪翁丁增：“路上有稀泥，石岩上有青苔，爬岩子，穿藏靴不行，你们有没有胶底鞋？”他们送给扎喜一双胶底鞋。
    第二天清早，扎喜和香巴罗布就领着他们出发了。
    他们有时照着野羊踩过的路前进，有时连这样的路也没有了，但是扎喜仍在前面引着他们。
    “扎喜！这里没有路啊！”聪翁丁增说。
    “你们放心吧！只管跟着我走好了。”扎喜说。
    原来扎喜在从前打猎经过的地方，都用石块作了标记，而这样的标记，只有扎喜才知道，别人是弄不清楚的。大约走了十五里，碰到一处很陡的石岩，聪翁丁增说：“前面没有路，过不去。”“你们不要担心。”扎喜说着，就去找寻他所作的标记；在岩缝中，他找着了从前搁置的石块，按着这标记向下望，石岩下有一处稍平的地方，插着一根木桩，这木桩也是扎喜打猎时留下的，人溜下石岩，踏住这根木桩，就可以站住脚。他们依次溜到下面，向前眺望，那冷曲河就在岩脚下。
    虽然看到了冷曲河，但要找出通到工区的路，还得向前爬，前面又是一段宽约三公尺的悬崖。张工程师说：“这段石岩，太不好走了，得挖一挖，不然，稍不留心，就掉到河里去了。”
    “不用挖，我们从上边绕过去。”香巴罗布说。
    “你们从上边绕着走，我从这里先过去。”扎喜刚说完，他左手攀住生长在岩缝中的一棵松树，顺身一跃，就到了石岩的那一端。跟着，香巴罗布跃过去了，其余的人也一个个地跃过去，扎喜一个个将他们搀扶住。
    走了一阵，又是一段悬崖。扎喜领着他们，顺着一条石槽往上爬。石槽很窄狭，穿上了棉衣，便通不过。这时，同行的人才意识到扎喜说的衣服不要穿得太厚的话，是怎样细致的对他们的关怀。张工程师四十多岁了，爬石槽时，每到危险的地方，扎喜就搀扶着他。他们爬上岩顶，从那里，可以看到怒江大桥的桥基，也可以看到工兵某团的工区。
    经历了一天艰苦的跋涉，他们终于找到了一条通向冷曲河工区的路。
    和他们在冷曲河南岸探路的同时，某团排长崔锡明和战士张仁义，不顾艰险，也在怒江西岸的悬崖绝壁上，找到了一条通向怒江西岸工区的路。
    怒江两岸和冷曲河的工程动工了，香巴罗布携带着桃子、鸡蛋和菜蔬，照着山羊走过的路，爬过重重悬崖，到了工兵某团的工地；聪翁丁增尽情地招待他，战士们热烈地欢迎他。
    扎喜、香巴罗布和广大藏族人民亲身经历了这个巨大的变化：在那重重高山中，已经出现了一条宽阔的公路，那日夜奔流的怒江上，已经跨有一座钢桥。世世代代人民的想望，今天已成为现实了。
