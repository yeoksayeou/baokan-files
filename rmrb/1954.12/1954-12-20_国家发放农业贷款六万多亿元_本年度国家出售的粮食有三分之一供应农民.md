Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: From January to October 1954, the National Bank issued 6,683.8 billion yuan in agricultural loans to help farmers develop production. Adding up the agricultural loans issued from 1950 to 1953, the cumulative amount issued has exceeded 36 trillion yuan.

	In the loans issued in the first half of this year, agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 23 percent, agricultural production mutual aid teams accounted for 49 percent, and individual farmers accounted for 28 percent. The vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives in various regions have received support from national loans. According to statistics from twelve counties in Jiangsu Province and twenty-two counties in Shanxi Province, agricultural production cooperatives receiving national loans accounted for over 95 percent of the total number of cooperatives.

	In addition to most of the National Bank's loans being used to help farmers overcome production difficulties, they also helped farmers solve problems such as a lack of food rations. Due to the gradual improvement of farmers' living standards and the development of credit cooperatives, statistics from 350 counties and cities (suburbs) in the first half of 1954 showed that the vast majority of national loans were used to help farmers dig wells, build large and small water conservancy projects, and purchase new-style farm tools, carts, sprayers, livestock, fertilizer, and seeds, and other means of production. Fewer farmers needed national loans to help with their living needs. The usage of loans from 1951 to 1953 was as follows: 66 percent was used to purchase fertilizer, livestock, seeds, farm tools, and to build farmland water conservancy projects, while 34 percent was used to solve agricultural and sideline production funds and the masses' living rations.

Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: According to statistics from the Ministry of Food, in the 1953-1954 grain year, more than 35 percent of the total amount of grain sold by the state was sold to farmers. More than 190 million farmers bought grain from the state. This includes farmers in cotton-growing areas who produce very little grain and grain-deficient farmers in grain-producing areas, as well as a small number of farmers who sell and buy grain for turnover purposes.

	The state has carried out tremendous work in the unified purchase and sale of grain in rural areas. Shandong, Hunan, Hebei and other places have mobilized the broad masses of farmers, and after democratic appraisal, issued grain purchase certificates to millions of farming households. More than 100,000 cadres in Hebei and Jiangxi provinces participated in this work. Hebei Province has a relatively large economic crop area. Before the summer harvest, more than 74,000 farming households in six special districts of the province received grain purchase certificates. Farmers in need of grain in 5,000 townships in Shanxi Province received grain purchase certificates. In order to supply grain to farmers in need in a timely manner, the grain departments have established extensive supply networks in rural areas across the country. In Hunan Province, in addition to mobile supply stations, there are an average of about three supply stations per district. In Hebei Province, after the new cotton harvest this year, a total of more than 3,700 supply stations were established. The price at which farmers buy grain from supply stations is only about 5.6 percent higher than the selling price; while when a free grain market exists, the seasonal price difference between spring and autumn often reaches 30 to 40 percent. It is estimated that the benefits gained by farmers across the country from this will amount to trillions of yuan.

    国家发放农业贷款六万多亿元
    本年度国家出售的粮食有三分之一供应农民
    【新华社十七日讯】　一九五四年一月到十月，国家银行发放了农业贷款六万六千八百三十八亿元，帮助农民发展生产。如把一九五零年到一九五三年发放的农业贷款加起来的话，累计已发放三十六万多亿元。
    今年上半年的贷款中，农业生产合作社占百分之二十三，农业生产互助组占百分之四十九，个体农民占百分之二十八。各地农业生产合作社绝大部分得到了国家贷款的扶持。据江苏省十二个县、山西省二十二个县的统计，得到国家贷款的农业生产合作社都占总社数的百分之九十五以上。
    国家银行的贷款除了大部分用以帮助农民克服生产上的困难外，还帮助农民解决缺乏口粮等问题。由于农民生活逐步改善和信用合作的发展，一九五四年上半年，据三百五十个县、市（郊区）的统计，国家的贷款绝大部分是用在帮助农民打井、修建大小水利工程和购买新式农具、大车、喷雾器、牲畜、肥料、种籽等生产资料。农民在生活方面需要国家贷款帮助的已不多。一九五一年到一九五三年贷款的用途情况是：用以购买肥料、牲畜、种籽、农具和兴修农田水利的占百分之六十六，用以解决农副业、手工业生产资金和群众生活口粮的占百分之三十四。
    【新华社十八日讯】据粮食部统计，一九五三—一九五四粮食年度内，国家卖出粮食的总数中，有百分之三十五以上是卖给农民的。向国家买粮的农民在一亿九千万人以上。这中间包括植棉区生产粮食很少的农民和产粮区的缺粮农民，以及少数为了周转需要把粮食卖出又买进的农民。
    国家在农村粮食统销中，进行了巨大的工作。山东、湖南、河北等地都发动广大农民群众，经过民主评议给数百万农户发了购粮证。河北、江西两省有十万多名干部参加了这个工作。河北省经济作物区较大，在夏收前，全省六个专区有七万四千多农户领得购粮证。山西省五千个乡的需粮农民都领到了购粮证。粮食部门为了把粮食及时供给需粮农民，在全国农村设立了广大供应网。湖南省除流动供应站外，平均一个区约有三个供应站。河北省在今年新棉收获后，设立的供应站共有三千七百多个。各地农民从供应站买进粮食的价格比卖出价格大约只多出百分之五点六；而当粮食自由市场存在时，粮食春贵秋贱的季节差价常常在百分之三十到四十。据估计，全国农民从这中间得到的利益将以数万亿元计。
