Just as the United States was clamoring in the United Nations to force the Chinese people to release thirteen American spies, the U.S. State Department announced on the 11th that the U.S. government refused to allow thirty-five Chinese students to leave the United States and return to their country.

The U.S. government forcibly detains more than 5,000 Chinese students in the United States, preventing them from returning home. This was publicly admitted by the U.S. delegation attending the Geneva Conference as early as June this year. If the U.S. government chooses such a time to re-announce its policy of forcibly detaining Chinese students as a so-called "retaliation" against China's punishment of American spies, it can only prove the U.S. government's extreme contempt for international law.

American spies engaged in espionage activities in China that violated Chinese law, so the Chinese government must sentence them to the punishment they deserve according to law. But what U.S. laws have Chinese students in the United States violated, that they should be indefinitely confined to the United States by the U.S. government and not allowed to return to their motherland?

Chinese students in the United States are Chinese citizens residing in the United States, just like American citizens residing in China. According to international law, no country can prevent a foreigner from leaving its territory under any circumstances, as long as the foreigner abides by the laws of the country in which they reside. The Chinese government treats American citizens in China in accordance with this provision of international law. Since the U.S. government cannot say what crimes more than 5,000 Chinese students have committed, or what legal obligations they have not fulfilled, what right does it have to prevent them from leaving U.S. territory?

According to the absurd logic of the U.S. government, American spies who come to China to engage in criminal espionage activities should be released and allowed to return to the United States, while Chinese students in the United States who have not committed any crimes should instead be deprived of their freedom to leave the United States and return to their motherland, and deprived of their right to reunite with their families.

That is to say, all guilty American aggressors should be treated as innocent, while all innocent Chinese citizens should be detained and confined. May I ask, where are the principles of international law in the U.S. government's approach? Where are fairness and justice?

The U.S. government has no right to forcibly detain Chinese students, just as it has no right to demand that the Chinese people release American spies. The U.S. government's forced detention of Chinese students, just like the U.S. government's clamoring for the release of American spies, only exposes the U.S. government's crime of rudely violating international law even more clearly.

    美国政府的荒唐逻辑
    新华社评论员　江南
    正当美国为了迫使中国人民释放十三名美国间谍而在联合国中大叫大嚷的时候，美国国务院在十一日宣布，美国政府拒绝允许三十五名中国留学生离美返国。
    美国政府强迫扣留着在美国的五千多名中国留学生，不准他们回国，这是早在今年六月间由出席日内瓦会议的美国代表团方面所公开承认了的。如果美国政府选择现在这样一个时机来重新宣布它强迫扣留中国留学生的政策，是为了对中国惩办美国间谍一事进行所谓“报复”，那只能证明美国政府对于国际公法的极端蔑视而已。
    美国间谍在中国进行了违犯中国法律的间谍活动，因此中国政府要依法判处他们应得的刑罚。但是中国留学生在美国违犯了美国的什么法律，以致于要被美国政府无限期软禁在美国，不许他们返回祖国呢？
    在美国的中国留学生是中国在美国的侨民，这就和美国在中国的侨民一样。按照国际公法，任何国家在任何情形之下不能阻止一个外国人离开它的领土，只要这个外国人遵守所在国的法令。中国政府就是按照国际公法的这种规定来对待美国在中国的侨民的。美国政府既然说不出五千多名中国留学生犯了什么罪，或是有什么法律义务没有履行，它有什么权利不许他们离开美国的领土呢？
    按照美国政府的荒唐逻辑，到中国来进行罪恶的间谍活动的美国间谍是应该予以释放，让他们回到美国去的，而在美国没有犯下任何罪行的中国留学生，反倒应该被剥夺掉离开美国、返回祖国的自由，被剥夺掉和他们家人团聚的权利的。
    这就是说，凡是有罪的美国侵略分子都应该按无罪办理，而凡是无罪的中国公民都应该予以扣留和软禁。试问在美国政府的这种做法之中，国际法的原则何在？公道与正义何在？
    美国政府没有任何权利强迫扣留中国留学生，正像它没有任何权利要求中国人民释放美国间谍一样。美国政府强迫扣留中国留学生，正如美国政府大叫大嚷要求释放美国间谍一样，只不过更清楚地暴露了美国政府粗暴地违犯国际公法的罪行。
