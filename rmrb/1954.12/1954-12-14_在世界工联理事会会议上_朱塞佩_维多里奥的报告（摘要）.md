    At the World Federation of Trade Unions Council Meeting
    Report by Giuseppe Di Vittorio (Summary)
    Giuseppe Di Vittorio, President of the World Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report at the meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions Council on December 11.

    Di Vittorio said that since the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the characteristics of the economic and political development of capitalist and colonial countries have been the increasing intensification of super-exploitation and suppression of the working people by employers and police organizations.

    Since the congress, large trusts and monopoly capital (the most powerful and most reactionary part of large enterprises) have strengthened and expanded their control over the economic, and thus the political, life of capitalist and colonial countries. They are intensifying their reactionary offensive against the working people in order to obtain maximum profits and to strengthen the exploitation of the working class to the greatest extent. We have seen a series of measures to reduce wages. We have seen an increasingly intensified speed-up system. We have seen an increasing number of layoffs and a series of other measures aimed at worsening the living and working conditions of the working class. We have seen that trusts and monopoly capital are making greater efforts to place the entire burden of rearmament and war preparations on the working people.

    Almost all capitalist countries are passing reactionary laws. Monopoly capitalists want to use repressive measures to crush the resistance of the working class in order to freely expand arms stockpiles, approve the Paris Accords, and prepare for another war.

    The offensive against the rights of the working class is carried out in two main aspects: on the one hand, the offensive against trade union organizations, trade union activities, the right to strike, trade union newspapers, and the right to worker gatherings. On the other hand, the offensive against the democratic rights of industrial workers, by suppressing and threatening trade union committees and trade union representatives in enterprises, and employers adopting fascist disciplinary measures at workplaces. While adopting repressive measures, they are also pursuing a policy of splitting the trade union movement, establishing one or many divisive trade union groups in order to mislead workers and thus undermine their movement.

    Di Vittorio emphasized that all these anti-union and anti-labor repressive measures are imitating the methods used by the United States to suppress the working class, and are imitating the typical Taft-Hartley anti-labor law of the United States. In many countries such as Egypt, Indonesia, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Greece, the Netherlands, and Japan, methods of restricting the right to strike directly copied from the Taft-Hartley Act have been adopted.

    While carrying out a reactionary offensive against the working people (regardless of their political beliefs) in order to continuously strengthen exploitation and extract high profits, imperialism is also trying to use the "ideological" mask of anti-communism to conceal the class nature of its actions. In some countries, McCarthyite methods are being adopted. In the United States itself, after the increasingly rampant application of the Taft-Hartley Act to trade unions, the Smith Act and the McCarran Act were passed. According to these laws, hundreds of trade union leaders have been interrogated or expelled from the United States. The notorious law on "Communist control" has been implemented. According to this law, any trade union deemed by the Subversive Activities Control Board to have been "infiltrated by Communists" has no right to represent workers or participate in trade union elections.

    Di Vittorio cited many examples to prove that the American rulers openly interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

    He said that in Italy, the US Embassy directly interfered in trade union elections, cancelled military orders from certain factories, and openly explained that this was because the workers in these factories elected candidates from the Italian General Confederation of Labor. The genuinely democratic government of Guatemala, legitimately elected in general elections through secret ballot in accordance with the freely expressed will of the people, was overthrown by American armed forces. The regime of terror established there by American agents embodies all the bloody revenge of the big capitalists of the United Fruit Company.

    Di Vittorio said that the World Federation of Trade Unions is also constantly under attack. Its publications have been banned by the governments of most countries in the Americas, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.

    Some countries refuse to issue entry visas to representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Many countries prohibit domestic trade union organizations from making contact. This restriction on trade union contacts clearly proves that imperialists are afraid of unified action on a domestic and international scale.

    Di Vittorio continued, we must forcefully expose the hypocrisy of the imperialist governments, which incessantly talk about being the defenders of the most sublime principles, pretending to be the defenders of human freedom and the protectors of democracy, calling their countries free countries, and actually attempting to justify their current propaganda of hatred and war against socialist countries, and their policies of cruelly exploiting and suppressing the working people.

    Di Vittorio said that defending trade union rights is the primary condition for trade unions to continue to act to improve living and working conditions, and is the primary condition for the working people to fight for arms reduction, easing international tensions, striving for world peace, and striving for the right of all nations to decide their own destiny. This struggle is carried out in three main aspects.

    First, the struggle for trade union freedom and for the free activities of trade union organizations and committees in factories. The struggle to gain recognition of trade unions, to gain the right for workers to elect trade union leaders in a democratic manner, to gain freedom of trade union publication and assembly, to gain the right to strike, and to gain the right of trade union organizations to defend workers' demands.

    Second, the struggle against employers implementing disciplinary measures, espionage systems, and political discrimination in industry. The principle underlying this struggle is that the worker's responsibility in industrial enterprises is only to fulfill his production tasks. Apart from these tasks, the employer has no right and absolutely must not make any demands on the worker.

    Third, the broad movement of the working people to defend democratic rights with trade union rights as the core, which have been subjected to the most rampant attacks by reactionary forces in some countries.

    In this situation, the struggle to defend and strive for trade union rights and democratic rights, although carried out in different ways in different countries, has the same scope and the same urgency in capitalist countries and colonial countries.

    Di Vittorio listed examples of workers engaging in victorious struggles and defending and winning trade union rights. For example, when a strike broke out in a factory in Detroit, USA, the employers and relevant authorities had intended to use this strike to finally split the trade union. But the workers (members of dozens of industrial trade union federations and local trade unions) participated in the picket line of the strike. Due to the solidarity of the Detroit workers, the striking workers victoriously defended the trade union and achieved a victory in raising wages. The trade union rights that the employers wanted to abolish were maintained.

    In Japan, five thousand workers in various departments of the Omi Kenshi textile company held a three-month strike demanding recognition of the trade union and trade union rights. Most of the workers were young girls under the age of twenty. They were previously not allowed to leave the prison-like factory, and were even unable to marry. Their letters were subject to inspection by the factory management. Thanks to the international solidarity of the British Trades Union Congress and our Textile and Garment Workers' International, the workers of Omi Kenshi textile company received assistance. Due to the victory of the united struggle, the working conditions of these young women were improved. Di Vittorio continued, this struggle is international in nature. The focus of this struggle is directed at the common enemy—the employers, the imperialists. The unity and genuine solidarity of the working people of all countries played a very important role in this struggle.

    Di Vittorio continued, the unprecedented development of the trade union movement and trade union strength in the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries, as well as the decisive role played by the trade unions of these countries in continuously improving the welfare of the working people, have given new strength to the struggle for trade union rights in capitalist countries and colonial countries. In those countries where there are no longer exploiting classes and the working people are masters of their own destiny, the charter of trade union rights is already far from sufficient.

    Di Vittorio said that the World Federation of Trade Unions has been and will continue to lead the international struggle for trade union rights. From the first day of its establishment, the World Federation of Trade Unions has been committed to effectively guaranteeing trade union rights in accordance with its constitution. The World Federation of Trade Unions is constantly engaged in this struggle. The solidarity of the World Federation of Trade Unions has extended into the labor movement and trade unions of Spain, Greece, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Iran,India, Pakistan, Japan , the Phillipines, Venezuela, Cuba, Argentina, Guatemala, Chile, The United States and other countries. In organizing these international campaigns and ensuring their effectiveness, the World Federation of Trade Unions has cooperated with those persecuted individuals and organizations. The World Federation of Trade Unions has carried out appropriate work in the United Nations Economic and Social Council and the International Labor Organization, striving for these organizations to more effectively guarantee the protection of trade union rights. The working people and trade unions of all countries should strive to participate in international activities and the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions. What requirements do we put forward in the charter? We demand freedom of association and assembly, we demand the elimination of all discrimination, we demand respect for the productive freedom of the working people, respect for the right of the working people to ensure that their organizational activities are not interfered with by the authorities, the right of trade unions to represent the working people, respect for the right to strike, and finally, respect for the right of trade unions to conduct international trade union activities.

    The charter of trade union rights that we are preparing to put forward to the working people of all countries only puts forward the most basic demands for rights, which can be called the natural rights of the working people. When we launch an international campaign on this issue, we should expose the enslaving intentions of the enterprise class and the government in the face of world public opinion. They deny the working people these social rights and human rights, or attack these rights.

    For example, the provisions on rights in the charter state that the working people should have the right to participate in and withdraw from production without any discrimination, as well as the right to assemble when stopping production activities, the right to discuss and freely express opinions on all issues related to them, the right to read and distribute trade union and workers' newspapers according to their own choice, and the right to unhindered exercise of the rights of those who are elected by the working people to exercise the trade union functions they perform or are entrusted by the trade union organization to perform.

    The provisions on rights also mention that trade union organizations "have the right to negotiate and sign collective contracts with enterprise owners and social authorities."

    Di Vittorio said that after the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the economic and political development of capitalist and colonial countries was characterized by the increasing intensification of super-exploitation of the working people and the increasingly frantic suppression of the working people by enterprise owners and the police.

    In the period since the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions, large trusts and monopoly capital (the most powerful and most reactionary large capitalists) have strengthened and expanded their control over economic activities in capitalist and colonial countries, and thus over political life.

    None of the principles and rights stipulated in our Charter of Trade Union Rights are not in accordance with the principles stipulated in the international documents signed by the governments of the vast majority of countries. However, in reality, these principles and rights are often not fulfilled, and these principles and rights are often not observed and adopted.

    The working people are precisely demanding the effective and genuine application of these rights, which are precisely those rights that the governments responsible for violating them have themselves declared. Therefore, we must expose, in the face of public opinion, those governments that do not actually abide by their obligations undertaken in international organizations, in accordance with the Charter of Trade Union Rights of the Working People.

    Therefore, the international trade union movement declaring the Charter of Trade Union Rights of the Working People can promote humanity towards the great goals of democracy, social justice, and world peace, which are precisely the goals pointed out by the people of all countries after the Second World War ended with a historic victory over fascism. This is why the struggle of the working people for the realization of the Charter of Trade Union Rights is a factor for social progress.

    Di Vittorio continued, making the struggle to realize the Charter of Trade Union Rights in every country, every industrial sector, and every enterprise closely and concretely linked to the struggle of the working people to achieve their economic demands is the basic condition for the Charter of Trade Union Rights to promote the trade union movement in achieving new achievements in the struggle for the social and economic demands of the working people and for trade union rights.

    Obviously, the objective environment of this struggle is different in every country and in every enterprise. This point must be noted.

    Di Vittorio said that there is no doubt that the World Federation of Trade Unions will play an important role in this movement. The World Federation of Trade Unions should help launch the struggle to realize the Charter, widely publicize this struggle, and publicize the various measures taken and the victories achieved in various countries. The World Federation of Trade Unions should provide assistance and solidarity to persecuted organizations and workers, and should call on the working people and trade unions of all countries to give the broadest support for this. The working people and trade unions of the metropolitan countries should give help to the working people and trade unions of the colonial countries in their struggle to win their rights and freedoms, and support this struggle. The World Federation of Trade Unions should take all necessary measures to organize the May Day of 1955 better than the May Day of 1954, making it a great international day of struggle for trade union rights and democratic freedoms.

    Di Vittorio finally said that in 1955, the World Federation of Trade Unions will celebrate its tenth anniversary. This is ten years of tireless struggle to strive for the observance and protection of trade union rights and for a great cause. From the time of its establishment, the World Federation of Trade Unions has been loyal to this great cause, and has always advanced along the path pointed out to it by the working people of the world who united in the victorious anti-fascist struggle. We will make 1955 a year of new victories, giving the heroic struggle of the working class to defend their inalienable rights and freedoms, which they have achieved at the cost of great sacrifice, and to strive for a better life in a peaceful environment, a broader future.

### 在世界工联理事会会议上  朱塞佩·维多里奥的报告（摘要）

    在世界工联理事会会议上
    朱塞佩·维多里奥的报告（摘要）
    世界工会联合会主席朱塞佩·维多里奥在世界工会联合会理事会十二月十一日的会议上作了报告。
    维多里奥说，在世界工会第三次代表大会以后，资本主义和殖民国家经济和政治的发展的特点是：雇主和警察组织对劳动人民的超额剥削和镇压日益加紧了。
    在代表大会举行以后，大托辣斯和垄断资本（大企业中最有势力的和最反动的部分）已经加强并且扩大了他们对资本主义和殖民国家的经济生活的、从而是政治生活的控制。它们正在加紧进行反动的对劳动人民的进攻，以便获得最大的利润，并且把对工人阶级的剥削加强到最大的限度。我们看到了一系列的减少工资的措施。我们看到了日益加强的赶快制度。我们看到日益增加的解雇和其他一系列目的在于使工人阶级的生活条件和劳动条件恶化的措施。我们看到，托辣斯和垄断资本正在作更大的努力，企图把重新武装和备战的全部负担加在劳动人民身上。
    差不多所有资本主义国家都在通过反动的法律。垄断资本家要用镇压的措施来粉碎工人阶级的反抗，以便放手扩充武器储存、批准巴黎协定以及准备另一次战争。
    对工人阶级的权利的进攻是在两个主要方面进行的：一方面是对工会组织、工会活动、罢工权利、工会报纸以及工人集会权利等等的进攻。另一方面是对产业工人的民主权利的进攻，办法是镇压和威胁企业中的工会委员会和工会代表，以及雇主在工作地点采用法西斯的惩罚措施。在采取镇压措施的同时，还推行分裂工会运动的政策，成立一个或许多个分裂性的工会集团，以便使工人迷失方向，从而破坏他们的运动。
    维多里奥着重指出，所有这些反工会和反劳工的镇压措施，都是仿效美国所使用的镇压工人阶级的方法的，都是仿效美国反劳工法的典型塔夫脱—哈特莱法的。在埃及、印度尼西亚、巴西、波多黎各、希腊、荷兰和日本等许多国家中已经采用了直接从塔夫脱—哈特莱法抄袭过来的限制罢工权利的办法。
    在对劳动人民（不管他们的政治信仰如何）实行反动进攻以便不断加强剥削和榨取高额利润的同时，帝国主义还在设法用反共这一个“观念形态”的假面具来掩饰它的行动的阶级性。在若干国家中正在采用麦卡锡分子的方法。在美国本土，在对工会越来越猖狂地应用塔夫脱—哈特莱法以后，又通过了史密斯法和麦卡锡法。根据这些法律，几百个工会领袖受到了审讯，或者被逐出美国国境。臭名远扬的关于“共产党管制”的法律已经实施了。根据这个法律，被颠覆活动管制委员会认为“已有共产党渗入”的任何工会，都没有代表工人和参加工会选举的任何权利。
    维多里奥举出许多例子证明美国统治者公然干涉其他国家的内政。
    他说，在意大利，美国大使馆直接干涉工会选举，取消某些工厂的军事订货，并且公然解释说：这是由于这些工厂的工人选举了意大利总工会的候选人。在大选中通过秘密投票的方式根据人民自由表达的意志合法地选举出来的、真正民主的危地马拉政府，被美国武装力量推翻了。美国代理人在那里建立的恐怖政权体现了联合果品公司的大资本家全部的血腥报复。　　维多里奥说，世界工会联合会也不断受到攻击。它的刊物被美洲、非洲、中东和亚洲的大多数国家的政府下令禁止。
    有一些国家拒绝发入境签证给世界工会联合会的代表。有许多国家禁止国内各工会组织进行接触。这种对工会联系的限制，清楚地证明帝国主义者害怕国内和国际规模的统一行动。
    维多里奥继续说，我们必须有力地揭穿帝国主义政府的伪善，它们喋喋不休地大谈它们是最崇高的原则的维护者，他们装成是人类自由的维护者和民主的保卫者，它们把它们的国家称为自由国家，它们居然企图为它们目前正在进行的反对社会主义国家的仇恨和战争的宣传，为它们残酷剥削劳动人民的政策和镇压劳动人民的政策辩护。
    维多里奥说，保卫工会权利是工会为改善生活和工作条件而继续行动的首要条件，是劳动人民为裁减军备、缓和国际紧张局势、争取世界和平和争取各个民族决定自己命运的权利而斗争的首要条件。这个斗争是在三个主要方面进行的。
    第一，争取工会自由和争取工厂的工会组织和委员会自由活动的斗争。争取承认工会、争取工人以民主方式选举工会领袖、争取工会出版自由和集会的权利，争取举行罢工的权利和争取工会组织保卫工人要求的权利的斗争。
    第二，在工业中反对雇主实行惩罚办法、暗探制度和政治歧视的斗争。这种斗争所依据原则就是：工人在工业企业中的责任仅仅是履行他的生产任务。除了这些任务以外，雇主无权而且也绝不能对工人提出任何要求。
    第三，劳动人民保卫以工会权利为核心的民主权利的广泛运动，这些民主权利在一些国家遭到了反动势力的最猖狂的进攻。
    在这种情况下，保卫和争取工会权利和民主权利的斗争虽然在不同国家以不同的方式进行，但是这个斗争在资本主义国家和殖民地国家内却具有同样的范围和同样的紧迫性。
    维多里奥列举工人进行了胜利的斗争并且保卫和赢得了工会权利的例子。例如在美国底特律一个工厂爆发罢工的时候，雇主们和有关当局曾经打算利用这次罢工最后使工会分裂。但是工人们（分属于几十个产业工会联合会和各地方工会的工会会员们）参加了罢工的纠察工作。由于底特律工人的团结一致，罢工工人们胜利地保卫了工会，并且取得了提高工资的胜利。雇主们想要废除的工会权利得到了维护。
    在日本，近江绢丝纺织公司各个部门的五千工人举行了三个月的罢工，要求承认工会和工会的权利。大多数工人都是不满二十岁的年青女孩。她们以前是不准离开牢狱般的工厂，甚至不能结婚的。她们的信件要受到厂方管理处的检查。由于英国职工大会和我们的纺织和服装工人工会国际的国际声援，近江绢丝纺织公司的工人得到了援助。由于团结一致的斗争取得了胜利，这些青年女工们的劳动条件改善了。维多里奥接着说，这一斗争是带有国际性的。这一斗争的锋芒是针对着共同的敌人——雇主、帝国主义分子的。各国劳动人民的一致和真正团结在这一个斗争中起了十分重要的作用。
      维多里奥接着说，苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的工会运动和工会力量的空前发展以及这些国家的工会在不断提高劳动人民福利方面所起的决定性的作用，都给予资本主义国家和殖民地国家中争取工会权利的斗争以新的力量。在那些不再有剥削阶级、劳动人民当了自己命运的主人的国家中，工会权利宪章已经是显得大大不够了。
    维多里奥说，世界工联过去是、将来也是领导着争取工会权利的国际斗争的。世界工联从它建立的第一天起就一直本着它的会章致力于有效地保障工会权利。世界工联毫不间断地在进行着这一斗争。世界工联的声援已经扩展到西班牙、希腊、突尼斯、摩洛哥、埃及、伊朗、印度、巴基斯坦、日本、菲律宾、委内瑞拉、古巴、阿根廷、危地马拉、智利、美国和其他一些国家的劳动人民和工会中去。这几年中，世界工联在组织这些国际运动以及保证这些运动取得效果方面，同那些被迫害的人士和组织取得了合作。世界工联在联合国经济及社会理事会和国际劳工组织中进行了适当的工作，争取这些组织比较有效地保证保护工会权利。各国的劳动人民和工会应该努力参加国际活动和世界工联的活动。我们在宪章中提出什么要求呢？我们要求结社和集会的自由，要求取消一切歧视，要求尊重劳动人民的生产自由，尊重劳动人民保障自己的组织活动不受当局干涉的权利，工会代表劳动人民的权利，尊重罢工的权利，最后，尊重工会进行国际工会活动的权利。
    我们准备向各国劳动人民提出来的工会权利宪章只提出了最基本的权利的要求，这些权利可以叫做劳动人民的自然权利。当我们在这个问题上展开一个国际运动的时候，应当在世界舆论面前揭露企业主阶级和政府的奴役意图。他们否认劳动人民的这些社会权利和人权，或者进攻这些权利。
    例如，在宪章中关于权利的规定说，劳动人民应当不受到任何歧视地有参加生产和退出生产的权利，以及在停止生产活动的时候有集会的权利，有就一切同他们有关的问题进行讨论和自由发表意见的权利，有按照自己的选择阅读和散发工会和工人的报纸的权利，有不受阻碍地行使劳动人民选出他们去行使或者工会组织委托他们行使的工会职权的人的权利。
    关于权利的规定还谈到工会组织“有权同企业主和社会当局进行谈判和签订集体合同”。
    维多里奥说，世界工会第三次代表大会之后，资本主义和殖民地国家的经济和政治发展的特点是：对劳动人民的超额剥削日益加重，企业主和警察日益疯狂地镇压劳动人民。
    在世界工会第三次代表大会以后的时期内，大托辣斯和垄断资本（资力最雄厚和最反动的大资本家）加强和扩大了对资本主义和殖民地国家中的经济活动的、从而对政治生活的控制。
    在我们工会权利宪章中所订的原则和权利，没有一点不是符合那些绝大多数国家的政府所签订的国际文献中所订的原则的。可是，实际上这些原则和权利却往往不被履行，这些原则和权利往往不被遵守和采纳。
    劳动人民正是要求切实地和真正地运用这些权利，而这些权利正是那些对侵犯它们负责任的政府自己宣布过的。因此，我们要依据劳动人民的工会权利宪章，在舆论面前揭露那些实际上不遵守它们在国际组织中所承担的义务的政府。
    因此，宣布劳动人民的工会权利宪章的国际工会运动，可以推动人类奔向民主、社会正义和世界和平的伟大目标，而这些目标正是各国人民在对法西斯取得具有历史意义的胜利而结束第二次世界大战以后所指出的。这就是为什么说，劳动人民群众争取实现工会权利宪章的斗争是社会进步的因素。
    维多里奥接着说，使每一个国家、每一个工业部门、每一个企业中争取实现工会权利宪章的斗争同劳动人民为达到自己的经济要求而进行的斗争密切而具体地联系起来，就是使工会权利宪章得以推动工会运动在争取达到劳动人民的社会和经济要求、争取工会权利的斗争中取得新成就的基本条件。
    显然，这个斗争的客观环境在每一个国家中，在每一个企业中，都是不同的。这一点是必须注意的。
    维多里奥说，毫无疑问，世界工联在这一运动中将起重要作用，世界工联应该帮助展开争取实现宪章的斗争，广泛宣传这个斗争，并且宣传在各国所采取的各种措施和已取得的胜利。世界工联应该给遭到迫害的组织和工作者以帮助和声援，并且应该为此号召各国劳动人民和工会给予最广泛的支持。宗主国的劳动人民和工会应当在殖民地各国劳动人民和工会争取自己权利和自由的斗争中，给他们帮助，并且支持这一斗争。世界工联应当采取各种必要的措施，使一九五五年的五一节组织得比一九五四年的五一节更好，使它成为争取工会权利和民主自由的伟大的国际斗争日。
    维多里奥最后说，一九五五年，世界工会联合会将庆祝它的成立十周年。这是争取遵守和保障工会权利、为伟大的事业而进行不倦斗争的十年。世界工联从成立的时候起就忠于这个伟大的事业，始终沿着在胜利的反法西斯斗争中团结起来的全世界劳动人民所指给它的道路前进。我们将使一九五五年成为新的胜利的一年，使工人阶级为维护自己曾经用重大牺牲代价来取得的不可剥夺的权利和自由、为争取在和平环境中更好地生活而进行的英勇斗争，具有更加宽广的前途。（新华社据塔斯社华沙十二日电）
