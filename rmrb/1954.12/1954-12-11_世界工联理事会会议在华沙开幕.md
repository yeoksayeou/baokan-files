Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 10th: The Seventh Session of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Council opened in Warsaw on the 9th, according to TASS. Representatives from over forty countries in Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa are attending the meeting.

    The opening session was presided over by Giuseppe Di Vittorio, President of the World Federation of Trade Unions. He pointed out that the meeting was being held under conditions of great international tension. The deteriorating living and working conditions of the working class and the attacks on their trade union rights are due to the monopoly capitalists' pursuit of maximum profits and the burden of military expansion in capitalist countries on the working people. Di Vittorio said that the working people of the world consider the London and Paris agreements to be a serious danger to Europe and the world. The expansion of armaments is a necessary consequence of these agreements. The WFTU Council calls on the parliaments of the countries concerned to reject these agreements and calls on the workers of Europe and the world to further unite their ranks and take broad united action to jointly fight against the London and Paris agreements. Di Vittorio pointed out that the specific proposals for establishing collective security in Europe put forward by Moscow are fully in line with the vital interests of the working people of the world.

    After the meeting adopted the agenda, Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report on the first item on the agenda, "The International Situation and the Implementation of the Third World Trade Union Congress's Resolution on Strengthening the Unity of Workers in the Struggle to Achieve Their Demands."

    世界工联理事会会议在华沙开幕
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社华沙讯：世界工会联合会理事会第七次会议九日在华沙开幕。出席会议的有欧洲、亚洲、美洲和非洲四十多个国家的代表。
    世界工会联合会主席朱塞佩·维多里奥主持会议开幕。他指出，会议是在世界局势十分紧张的情况下召开的。工人阶级的生活和劳动条件之所以日益恶化，它们的工会权利之所以遭到进攻，就是因为垄断资本家追求最大限度的利润，资本主义国家的扩军重担压在劳动人民身上。维多里奥说，世界劳动人民认为伦敦和巴黎协定对于欧洲和世界是一个严重的危险。军备的扩张必然是这些协定的后果。世界工会联合会理事会号召各有关国家的议会拒绝批准这些协定，并且号召欧洲和全世界的劳动者更加团结自己的队伍，做到广泛的统一行动，以便共同进行反对伦敦和巴黎协定的斗争。维多里奥指出，从莫斯科发出的建立欧洲集体安全的具体建议，是完全符合全世界劳动者的切身利益的。
    在会议通过了议程以后，世界工会联合会总书记路易·赛扬就第一项议程“国际形势和世界工会第三次代表大会关于在工人争取实现他们的要求的斗争中加强他们的团结的决定的执行情况”作了报告。
