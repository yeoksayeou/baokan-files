    Guizhou Province is continuously transporting large quantities of grain to various industrial and mining areas to support national economic construction. From January to October this year, Guizhou Province transferred a total of 320,420,000 jin of rice, wheat, and flour to Anshan, Lushun, Dalian, and other places. Within the province, over 6,300,000 jin of grain have been transferred from counties with higher grain yields to mining areas in counties such as Yuping, Hezhang, and Qinglong.
    Guizhou Province has again achieved a bumper harvest of grain this year. Farmers of all ethnic groups are enthusiastically paying agricultural taxes and selling surplus grain to support national industrial construction. The Bunjie Agricultural Production Cooperative of the Buyi ethnic group in Changshun County has already sold 70,000 jin of surplus grain to the state; Ban Kai Zhi, the cooperative director and a Buyi farmer, also mobilized more than 200 people in the township to sell 330,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Sixteen agricultural production cooperatives in San Sui County increased their sweet potato production by 60% compared to last year. They are paying special attention to storage and preservation, preparing to consume large quantities of sweet potatoes and sell more grain to the state. In the process of paying agricultural taxes and selling surplus grain, farmers in many areas proposed and implemented the slogan "If it's not clean, it doesn't leave the village; only dried and winnowed grain enters the warehouse," ensuring the quality of the grain entering the warehouse. Farmers in the Guiding Special District launched a heatwave of sun-drying public grain after the autumn harvest. Farmers in Guangshun District of Changshun County had already completely dried the public grain due to be handed over to the state by the end of October, and stored it separately. As of November 20, according to incomplete statistics, the grain that has been put into storage accounts for 40.25% of the province's grain requisition and purchase task.

    贵州省调粮食支援工业建设
    贵州省陆续运往各工矿区大批粮食，支援国家经济建设。从今年一月到十月，贵州省调运到鞍山、旅顺、大连等地的大米、小麦、面粉等共有三亿二千零四十二万多斤。在本省内，从产粮较多的县份调运到玉屏、赫章、晴隆等县矿区的粮食，有六百三十多万斤。
    今年贵州省的粮食又获得丰收。各族农民为了支援国家工业建设，都踊跃地缴纳公粮，出卖余粮。长顺县布依族布结农业生产合作社已经把七万斤余粮卖给国家；社主任、布依族农民颁开志还动员全乡二百多人卖给国家三十三万斤余粮。三穗县十六个农业生产合作社今年种的红苕比去年增产百分之六十，他们特别注意作好保管和收藏工作，准备大量食用红苕，节约更多的粮食卖给国家。许多地区的农民在缴公粮和卖余粮的过程中，提出并实现了“不干不净不出村，晒干扬净才入库”的口号，保证了入库粮食的质量。贵定专区的农民从秋收以后就掀起了晒公粮的热潮。长顺县广顺区的农民在十月底就已经把应缴给国家的公粮全部晒干，单独装起。截至十一月二十日止，据不完全统计，各地入库的粮食已经占全省征粮购粮任务的百分之四十点二五。　（本报贵州记者站）
