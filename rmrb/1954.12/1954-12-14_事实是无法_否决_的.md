Title: Facts Cannot Be "Vetoed"

Under the manipulation of the United States, the Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly actually vetoed the proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation regarding "the acts of aggression against the People's of Republic of China and the responsibility of the United States Navy for these acts." This shows that the United States and its followers have once again led the United Nations organization away from the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and turned it into a tool for covering up American crimes of aggression.

The Soviet delegation's proposal correctly pointed out that the United States' aggression against China's territory of Taiwan and its collusion with the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique in carrying out war activities and piracy has turned this region into a new source of war, posing a serious threat to peace. Now, the US-Chiang war treaty has further aggravated this situation. As an international organization for maintaining world peace and security, the United Nations has a full responsibility to seriously discuss this issue, condemn the United States' acts of aggression, and take necessary measures to stop such acts of aggression, thereby promoting the development of the Far East international situation in a direction favorable to peace.

However, the American aggressive bloc has consistently and arrogantly obstructed the United Nations from fulfilling its due responsibilities. As early as August 1950, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai filed a complaint with the United Nations against the United States' aggression against our country's Taiwan. When the Soviet Union requested that this issue be included in the agenda of the United Nations Security Council for discussion, the United States tried its best to prevent the United Nations from taking any legitimate action.

When our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai once again filed a complaint with the current session of the United Nations General Assembly on October 10th against the United States' aggression against Taiwan, the United States delegation attempted to undermine the established procedures of the United Nations and shamelessly obstructed the United Nations Secretary-General from distributing Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram of complaint to the member states of the United Nations. Regarding the just proposal submitted by the Soviet delegation, the United States manipulated the General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to repeatedly postpone its consideration; then it conspired to force the current session of the United Nations General Assembly to end early in order to escape condemnation. U.S. representative Jackson urgently requested "to dispose of" the Soviet proposal quickly during the debate in the Special Political Committee. It can be seen how guilty and timid the American aggressors appear in the face of sunlight.

In the debate in the Special Political Committee, U.S. representative Jackson did not dare to touch the large amount of specific facts listed in the complaint telegram of our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai and the various statements made by the Soviet representatives at this session, but only resorted to sophistry and empty denials. However, all the denials and rogue behavior of American diplomats can absolutely not hide the truth from the eyes and ears of the people of the world.

U.S. representative Jackson regarded the people of the world as blind, nonsensically claiming that "approximately eight or nine hundred American officers and personnel are stationed in Taiwan," therefore "everyone can clearly see that the United States has neither occupied nor invaded Taiwan." But what are the American military personnel doing in Taiwan? Whose fleet is the Seventh Fleet entrenched off the coast of Taiwan? Whose air force has been treating Taiwan as an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" for the past few years? If this is not an act of aggression, what is it? Former U.S. Far East Commander MacArthur once nakedly revealed the U.S. conspiracy to occupy Taiwan, saying: The United States believes that Taiwan is the "keystone" in the U.S. chain of Pacific islands, and the United States must occupy Taiwan for a long time so that the United States can "control every Asian seaport from Vladivostok to Singapore with its air force." Isn't this an aggressor's confession?

On December 23, 1949, the U.S. State Department issued a "Policy Guidance on Taiwan," acknowledging that "Taiwan is politically, geographically, and strategically a part of China," "The United States acquiring bases in Taiwan; sending troops there; supplying weapons; sending naval vessels there; or taking any similar action, will...involve the United States in a protracted adventure,...and at worst, may involve it in open warfare, exposing the United States to fierce propaganda attacks, and the Chinese people will all oppose our 'militarism, imperialism, and interference'." Today, the United States has carried out aggression and interference in this way. The U.S.-Chiang war treaty further exposed the United States' intention to occupy Taiwan "indefinitely effectively" and prepare to launch a war of aggression against China. U.S. representative Jackson's clumsy denial tactics are completely useless.

Jackson used a trick, deliberately bypassing the undeniable crime of American aggression against Taiwan, and wantonly slandered the great and just Resist America, Aid Korea movement of the Chinese people, and the recent sentencing of the American spy case by the Military Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court of our country. At the same time, this Jackson suddenly played the role of a "friend" of the Chinese people, shamelessly talking about the "consistent and traditional friendly and aid policy" of the American ruling group towards the Chinese people. Isn't this just like the behavior of the wolf in sheep's clothing in the story?

The United States' manipulation of the United Nations Special Political Committee to veto the Soviet proposal cannot conceal the United States' crime of aggression against China in the slightest, but only further arouses the righteous indignation of peace-loving people all over the world and strengthens the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan.

    事实是无法“否决”的
    李高
    在美国的操纵下，联合国大会特别政治委员会竟然否决了苏联代表团提出的关于“侵略中华人民共和国的行为以及美国海军对这些行为的责任”的提案。这表明美国和它的追随者再一次使联合国组织远离联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，变成了掩护美国侵略罪行的工具。
    苏联代表团的提案正确地指出美国侵略中国领土台湾和勾结蒋介石卖国集团进行战争活动和海盗活动的行为，使这个地区变成了新的战争策源地，形成对和平的严重威胁。现在，美蒋战争条约更使这一局势为之恶化。联合国作为一个维护世界和平和安全的国际组织，完全有责任对这一问题进行认真的讨论，谴责美国的侵略行为，并采取必要的措施制止这种侵略行为，从而促使远东国际形势向有利于和平的方向发展。
    但是，美国侵略集团自始至终专横地阻挠联合国负起它应负的职责。我国外交部长周恩来早在一九五○年八月就向联合国提出了控诉美国侵略我国台湾案，苏联要求把这一问题列入联合国安理会议程讨论，美国那时就竭力阻挠联合国采取任何的正当行动。
    今年十月十日我国外交部长周恩来再一次向联合国大会本届会议提出美国侵略台湾的控诉时，美国代表团竟图破坏联合国的既定的程序，无耻地阻挠联合国秘书长向联合国会员国散发周外长的控诉电文。对于苏联代表团提出的正义提案，美国则操纵联合国大会总务委员会一再将其延期审议；接着又阴谋强使本届联合国大会提前结束，以逃避谴责。美国代表杰克逊在特别政委会辩论时情急地要求“以迅速处理掉”苏联提案。可见美国侵略者在阳光面前是显得多么心虚和胆怯。
    在特别政委会的辩论中，美国代表杰克逊对我国周恩来外长的控诉电文和苏联代表在本届会议上的历次发言中所列举的大量具体事实，根本不敢碰一下，而只是一味强词夺理，空口抵赖。但是，美国外交家的一切抵赖和耍无赖，都绝对掩盖不住全世界人民的耳目的。
    美国代表杰克逊把全世界人民都当成是瞎子，胡说什么“约有八九百名美国军官和人员驻在台湾”，因此“人人都可以清楚看出，美国既没有侵占台湾也没有占领台湾”。但是，美国的军事人员在台湾是干什么的？盘踞在台湾海岸的第七舰队是那一国的舰队？几年来把台湾当成“不沉的航空母舰”的航空队又是那国的空军？这不是侵略行为是什么？前美国远东总司令麦克阿瑟就曾赤裸裸地道出过美国侵占台湾的阴谋，他说：美国认为台湾是美国太平洋岛屿的锁链中的“总枢纽”，美国必须长期侵占台湾，以便美国“用空军控制自海参威至新加坡的每一亚洲的海港”。这不是侵略者的供状吗？
    一九四九年十二月二十三日美国国务院曾发布过一个“关于台湾的政策宣传指示”，承认“台湾在政治上、地理上和战略上都是中国的一部分”，“美国在台湾取得基地；派军队去；供应武器；派海军船只去；或者采取任何类似的行动，都将……使美国卷入长期的冒险中，……弄得不好，可能卷入公开战争，使美国遭到猛烈的宣传攻击，中国人民都将反对我们的‘军国主义、帝国主义和干涉’”。今天美国就是这样进行了侵略和干涉的。美蒋战争条约更加暴露了美国要“无限期有效”地侵占台湾，并准备发动侵略中国的战争。美国代表杰克逊的拙劣的抵赖伎俩是完全无济于事的。
    杰克逊使用了一种诡计，故意绕过美国侵略台湾的无可抵赖的罪行，大肆诬蔑中国人民伟大正义的抗美援朝运动，和最近我国最高人民法院军事审判庭对于美国间谍案的宣判。同时，这个杰克逊忽然又扮演成中国人民的“朋友”，恬不知耻地大谈美国统治集团对中国人民的“一贯的和传统的友好及援助政策”。这不活像故事里的那披着羊皮的狼的行径吗？
    美国操纵联合国特别政治委员会否决苏联提案，丝毫不能掩饰美国侵略中国的罪行，只有更加激起全世界爱好和平的人民的义愤，加强中国人民解放台湾的决心。
