Jixi Mining Machinery Factory

    Manufactures Many Coal Mining Machines

    The "Donbas-1" type combined coal mining machine, the first domestically produced model successfully trial-manufactured by the Jixi Mining Machinery Factory last December, underwent underground testing and performed well. Its load and traction capacity met the design requirements, and it was well-received at the Leipzig International Fair. The factory will continue to manufacture ten "Donbas-1" type combined coal mining machines this year, all of which will be installed by December. Three new products have been successfully trial-manufactured: the 153 coal loader, electric rock loader, and drilling machine. The 153 coal loader is the latest type of mechanized coal loading equipment, equipped with explosion-proof features, making it suitable for both surface and underground use, capable of loading 50 tons of coal per hour. The 153 coal loader and electric rock loader are now in small-scale production. In addition, it also produces pneumatic rock grabbers and drilling rigs ranging from 100 meters to 500 meters. Next year, it will trial-manufacture the "Miner" brand "combined coal mining machine" suitable for thin coal seams.

    The Jixi Mining Machinery Factory was originally a repair shop affiliated with the Jixi Coal Mine Bureau. Due to significant development in recent years, the number of employees has increased more than fourfold. Precision machine tools manufactured in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries now account for more than 80% of all machine tools. As a result, it has the independent capacity to manufacture mining machinery in large quantities. This year, it was officially established as a medium-sized mining machinery manufacturing factory, specializing in manufacturing various coal mining machines for coal mines nationwide.

    鸡西矿山机械厂
    制造许多采煤机械
    鸡西矿山机械厂在去年十二月试制成功的我国自制第一台“顿巴斯——一”型联合采煤机，下井试验结果，运转良好，负荷和牵引能力都能达到设计要求，在莱比锡国际博览会展览时亦博得好评。该厂今年继续制造的“顿巴斯——一”型联合采煤机十台，十二月份即可全部安装完成。已试制成功的有一五三装煤机、电力装岩机、穿孔机等三种新产品。一五三装煤机是最新型的机械化装煤设备，因有防爆设备，地面和井下都可适用，每小时可装煤五十吨。一五三装煤机、电力装岩机两种新产品现已进行小批生产。此外，还生产了汽力抓岩机、一百公尺到五百公尺的钻机等机械设备。明年将试制适于薄煤层的矿工牌“联合采煤机”。
    鸡西矿山机械厂原系鸡西煤矿矿务局所属的一个修配厂，由于近几年来有了极大发展，职工人数增加了四倍以上，新添增的苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等国制造的精密机床已占全部机床百分之八十以上，因而已具备独立大量制造矿山机械能力，今年正式成立为中型矿山机械制造厂，专为全国煤矿制造各种采煤机械。　（本报黑龙江记者站）
