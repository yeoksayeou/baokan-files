Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 15th: At the Korean Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 14th, the Korean and Chinese sides suggested that both sides grant special permission for North and South Korean representatives to enter the Military Armistice Commission headquarters area on December 17th for preliminary talks on postal and telecommunications liaison issues between North and South Korea, and suggested providing the building of the Korean and Chinese side secretariat of the Military Armistice Commission as the venue for this meeting. This meeting was proposed by the Minister of Post and Telecommunications of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

The American side once again adopted a negative attitude towards this important step to restore contact between the people of North and South Korea. The American representative stated at the meeting: Only after both governments agree to hold talks will we agree to use this building.

Senior member Li Xiangchao of the Korean and Chinese side said at the meeting: Based on the unanimous wishes of all Korean people, on December 1, 1954, the Minister of Post and Telecommunications of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea proposed to the Minister of Post and Telecommunications of South Korea that a preliminary meeting to discuss postal and telecommunications liaison issues between North and South Korea be held at Panmunjom at 10:00 a.m. on December 17, 1954, and has dispatched representatives.

Li Xiangchao also said: In view of our reasonable proposal not yet being resolved due to your unreasonable attitude, we believe it is necessary for the Military Armistice Commission to take administrative arrangements to enable representatives from both sides to hold talks. Therefore, we suggest granting special permission for representatives from both North and South Korea to enter the Military Armistice Commission headquarters area and providing the building of the Korean and Chinese side secretariat of the Military Armistice Commission as their venue.

In his speech, Li Xiangchao also once again requested the American side to seriously consider the Korean and Chinese side's proposal regarding both sides granting special permission for Korean people to freely travel between North and South Korea for non-military purposes. Li Xiangchao pointed out: According to the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, with the special permission of the Military Armistice Commission and the party concerned, one can travel freely between the military control areas of both sides. The military demarcation line in Korea is only a line of armistice and not a national border. No Korean people believe, nor can they believe, that the military demarcation line is a national border.

    朝中方面再次建议恢复南北朝鲜间的联系
    希望双方特许南北朝鲜代表会谈邮电联络问题
    【新华社开城十五日电】在十四日的朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上，朝中方面建议双方特许对南北朝鲜之间邮电联络问题进行初步会谈的南北朝鲜代表在十二月十七日进入军事停战委员会总部区，并且建议提供军事停战委员会总部朝中方面秘书处的建筑物作为这项会谈的会场。这项会谈是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国递信相提议举行的。
    美方对这项恢复南北朝鲜人民之间的联系的重要步骤又一次采取消极的态度，美方代表在会上声称：只有在双方政府都同意举行会谈以后，我们才同意使用这所建筑物。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在会上说：根据全体朝鲜人民一致的愿望，一九五四年十二月一日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国递信相向南朝鲜递信部长官提议，一九五四年十二月十七日上午十时在板门店召开讨论南北朝鲜之间邮电联络问题的初步会谈，并已派遣代表。
    李相朝中将又说：鉴于我方的合理建议，因你方的无理态度而尚未得到解决，我们认为有必要由军事停战委员会采取行政安排使双方代表进行会谈，因此我方建议特许南北双方代表进入军事停战委员会总部区，并提供军事停战委员会总部朝中方面秘书处的建筑物作为他们的会场。
    李相朝中将在发言中并且再一次提出要求美方郑重考虑朝中方面提出的关于双方特许朝鲜人民为非军事性目的，得自由来往于南北朝鲜之间的建议。李相朝中将指出：根据停战协定的规定，经过军事停战委员会和有关一方的特许是可以来往于双方军事控制地区的。军事分界线在朝鲜只是停战的界线而并非国境，朝鲜人民谁也不认为也不能认为军事分界线就是国境。
