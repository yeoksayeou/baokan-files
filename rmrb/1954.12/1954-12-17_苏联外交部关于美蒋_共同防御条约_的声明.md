Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 16th: TASS Moscow, December 16th: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement:

    On December 2, 1954, the United States of America and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, hiding in Taiwan, signed a so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" in Washington.
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles revealed the aggressive nature of this treaty when he said: "I hope that the signing of this defense treaty will once and for all dispel the rumors and reports that the United States will in some way agree to hand over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to communist control."
    From the full text of the aforementioned aggressive treaty and Mr. Dulles's remarks, it can be seen that the aim of the United States is to seize Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from China and establish its own rule over these Chinese territories.
    This U.S. action blatantly violates its obligations under international agreements, which confirm China's legitimate rights over the aforementioned territories that have historically belonged to China.
    As everyone knows, the Cairo Declaration, signed by the United States and the United Kingdom in 1943, solemnly declared: "Territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, shall be returned to China." This decision was reaffirmed in the Potsdam Proclamation of 1945, which was also signed by the United States and the United Kingdom. After Japan's surrender, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were returned to mainland China.
    Subsequently, the U.S. government repeatedly stated that the United States had no aggressive intentions towards the aforementioned territories. For example, in a statement on the Taiwan issue on January 5, 1950, President Truman said: "The United States has no predatory ambitions with respect to Taiwan or any other Chinese territory. The United States has no intention of obtaining special rights or privileges or establishing military bases on Taiwan now. Nor does the United States contemplate using armed forces to intervene in the present situation. …Similarly, the U.S. Government will not provide military aid or advice to Chinese forces on Taiwan.”
    However, in June 1950, at the same time as the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. government ordered its troops to be stationed in Taiwan and, in fact, still occupies this part of the territory of the People's Republic of China to this day.
    The aggressive treaty signed by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique on December 2 aims to find an excuse for the illegal stationing of U.S. armed forces in Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, and to maintain the U.S. occupation of these territories.
    The U.S. government's treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan is a blatant act of infringing upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China, and therefore also an act of violating the Charter of the United Nations. Article 2, paragraph 4 of the Charter stipulates: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or nation, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations."
    Since Taiwan has historically been Chinese territory, the liberation of Taiwan is naturally China's internal affair and the sovereignty of the Chinese people.
    If it were not for the intervention of U.S. armed forces, the return of Taiwan to China would have been realized long ago.
    The U.S. government is carrying out aggression against China, intending to seize part of its territory by military means, but attempts to justify its actions with obviously untenable arguments about U.S. security. The clumsiness of this argument is very obvious, because everyone knows that China and the United States are separated by the Pacific Ocean, and Taiwan is more than 11,000 kilometers away from the United States.
    From the aforementioned aggressive treaty between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, it can be seen that the provisions of the treaty apply not only to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, but also to "other territories as determined by agreement between the two parties." This means that the U.S. government regards Taiwan and the Penghu Islands as one of the military bases for future aggression against the People's Republic of China and other peace-loving countries in the Far East and Southeast Asia. These actions by the United States will undoubtedly worsen the situation in the Far East and aggravate international tensions.
    The conclusion of the Paris Agreements, which aim to revive German militarism and drag West Germany into military blocs, the establishment of military blocs aimed at maintaining colonial rule in Southeast Asia, the U.S. signing of the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Rhee Syngman government of South Korea - which is actually a treaty for the United States to establish a new military base in the Far East, and the U.S. concluding a treaty hostile to the Chinese people with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan: all of this are links in the entire chain of the U.S. policy of obstructing the easing of international tensions and accelerating preparations for a new war.
    As everyone knows, the Soviet government's attitude towards the U.S. aggressive policy towards the People's Republic of China has been stated in the joint declaration of the government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the government of People’s Republic of China on October 12, 1954. This joint declaration states that the direct acts of aggression committed by the United States against the People's Republic of China, in particular its continued occupation of the Chinese territory of Taiwan and its military and financial assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the enemy of the Chinese people—all this is incompatible with the task of safeguarding peace in the Far East and easing international tensions.
    The Soviet government declares that it agrees with the attitude expressed by Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai in his statement on December 8: the U.S.-Chiang treaty is an interference in China's internal affairs, an infringement on China's territorial integrity, and a threat to China's security and peace in Asia. The Soviet government fully supports the demand of the government of the People's Republic of China: the U.S. troops must withdraw from Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and the Taiwan Strait, and stop the acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China's demand for the liberation of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands—an indivisible part of Chinese territory—and the Chinese people's determination to liberate these areas are understood by the Soviet people.
    The Soviet government declares: The U.S. government shall bear full responsibility for the consequences of the aggressive "Mutual Defense Treaty" concluded between the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
                                    December 15, 1954

### 苏联外交部关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明

    苏联外交部关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十六日电：苏联外交部声明如下：
    一九五四年十二月二日，美利坚合众国和躲藏在台湾的蒋介石集团在华盛顿签订了一个所谓“共同防御条约”。
  美国国务卿杜勒斯泄露了这个条约的侵略性质，他说：“我希望，这个防御条约的签订将会一次地、永远地消除关于美国会以某种方式同意把台湾和澎湖列岛交给共产党控制的传说和报道。”
    从上述侵略性的条约的全文和杜勒斯先生的谈话中可以看出，美国的目的是要从中国手中夺去台湾和澎湖列岛，在这些中国的领土上建立自己的统治。
    美国这种行为悍然违反了它在国际协定中所承担的义务，这些协定确认中国对上述历来属于中国的领土的合法权利。
    大家知道，一九四三年美国和英国都参与签了字的开罗宣言庄严地宣布：“日本所窃取于中国人民之领土，例如满洲、台湾、澎湖列岛等，归还中国。”这一决定又在一九四五年的波茨坦公告中被确认，美国，以及英国也在这一公告上签了字。日本投降以后，台湾和澎湖列岛重归于中国大陆。
    随后，美国政府曾一再声明，美国对上述领土没有任何侵略意图。例如，一九五零年一月五日杜鲁门总统在关于台湾问题的声明中说：“美国对台湾或中国其他领土从无掠夺的野心。现在美国无意在台湾获取特别权利或者特权或者建立军事基地。美国也不拟使用武装部队干预目前的局势。……同样地，美国政府也不拟对在台湾的中国军队提供军事的援助或意见。”
    但是在一九五零年六月，在朝鲜战争爆发的同时，美国政府就命令自己的军队进驻台湾，而实际上直到现在还占领着中华人民共和国的这一部分领土。
    美国和蒋介石集团十二月二日签订的侵略性的条约，目的是为美国武装部队非法驻扎在台湾和澎湖列岛找借口，是为了保持美国对这些领土的占领。
    美国政府和台湾的蒋介石集团签订条约，是悍然侵犯中华人民共和国的主权和领土完整的行为，因而也就是破坏联合国宪章的行为。宪章第二条第四款规定：“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立。”
    既然台湾历来就是中国的领土，解放台湾自然是中国的内部事务，是中国人民的主权。
    假如不是由于美国武装力量的干涉，台湾的重归中国早就已经实现了。
    美国政府对中国实行侵略，打算以武力手段夺取它的一部分领土，而却企图以显然站不住脚的关于美国安全的论调为借口，为它的这种行动辩解。这种论据的笨拙是非常明显的，因为大家都知道，中国和美国隔着一个太平洋，而台湾距离美国在一万一千公里以上。
    从上述美国和蒋介石集团之间的侵略条约中可以看出，条约的规定不仅适用于台湾和澎湖列岛，而且也适用于“经双方协议所决定之其他领土”。这就是说，美国政府把台湾和澎湖列岛看作将来对中华人民共和国以及远东和东南亚其他爱好和平的国家进行侵略的军事基地之一。美国方面的这种行动，没有疑问会使远东的局势恶化，并加剧国际紧张局势。
    缔结以复活德国军国主义、把西德拖入军事集团为目的的巴黎协定，建立以维持在东南亚的殖民统治为目的的军事集团，美国同南朝鲜李承晚政府签订所谓“共同防御条约”——实际上是美国在远东建立一个新的军事基地的条约，美国同台湾的蒋介石集团缔结和中国人民为敌的条约：所有这一切都是美国阻挠缓和国际紧张局势、加速准备新战争这一政策的整个锁链中的各个环节。
    大家知道，苏联政府对于美国对中华人民共和国实行的侵略政策的态度已经在一九五四年十月十二日苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府和中华人民共和国政府的联合宣言中表示过。在这个联合宣言中说，美国对中华人民共和国所进行的直接的侵略行为，特别是它对中国领土台湾的继续侵占以及它对中国人民公敌蒋介石集团的军事和财政的援助——所有这一切，都是同维护远东和平和缓和国际紧张局势的任务不相容的。
    苏联政府声明：它同意中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来在十二月八日的声明中所表示的态度：美蒋条约是对中国内政的干涉，是对中国领土完整的侵犯，并且威胁中国的安全和亚洲和平。苏联政府完全支持中华人民共和国政府的要求：美国军队必须从台湾、澎湖列岛和台湾海峡撤走，停止对中华人民共和国的侵略行为。中华人民共和国对解放台湾和澎湖列岛——中国领土的不可分割的一部分——的要求，以及中国人民解放这些地区的决心，是为苏联人民所理解的。
    苏联政府声明：美国和蒋介石集团之间缔结的侵略性的“共同防御条约”的后果应由美利坚合众国政府负完全的责任。
                                    一九五四年十二月十五日
