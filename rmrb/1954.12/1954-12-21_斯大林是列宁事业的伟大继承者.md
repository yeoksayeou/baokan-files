Stalin dedicated his life to the noble cause of liberating the working class and all working people from the oppression of exploiters, and to the struggle for the happiness of the people and the victory of communism. Stalin's life and activities are an inspiring example of wholehearted service to the people and boundless fidelity to the ever-victorious doctrine of Marxism-Leninism.

Stalin's revolutionary work began at a time when Lenin was launching a great struggle to establish a revolutionary Marxist proletarian party—a party of a new type—in Russia. In the early days of his revolutionary activities, Stalin was filled with boundless confidence in Lenin's genius and resolutely embarked on Lenin's path. Stalin regarded Lenin as the highest type of leader, an eagle who knew no fear in struggle and boldly guided the Party to advance along a path that the Russian revolutionary movement had never traveled before. Stalin called himself a student of Lenin, and believed that his lifelong goal was to be a true student of Lenin. He was always a staunch Leninist and a loyal successor to Leninist ideas, no matter where or when.

Lenin, the genius successor to the theories and cause of Marx and Engels, creatively developed Marxism under new historical conditions. He created the theory of a new type of Marxist party, and formulated the ideological, organizational, tactical and theoretical basis of this party. He launched a relentless struggle against the open and hidden enemies of Marxism, against all forms of opportunism in the workers' movement, and in order to organize and unite the forces of the proletariat under the banner of revolutionary Marxism. In the struggle to establish a Marxist working-class party, Stalin was Lenin's loyal comrade-in-arms.

The Communist Party, founded and tempered by the great Lenin, led the people of all nationalities in Russia to the victory of the October Socialist Revolution. The Russian proletariat, in alliance with the working peasantry, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by Lenin, made the greatest historical achievement—the first breakthrough of the world imperialist front, and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, thus opening up a new era in human history—the era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of communism.

As a result of the victory of the October Revolution, a new type of state was established in history—a socialist state of workers and peasants. Stalin was Lenin's closest assistant in building and consolidating the Soviet state, and in defending the young Soviet republic from the sabotage of domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries.

The Communist Party led by Lenin carried out tremendous work in uniting the Soviet republics into a unified alliance state—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Stalin played a prominent role in realizing this historic task. The establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was a victory for the Communist Party's Leninist-Stalinist national policy. The establishment of the Union infinitely consolidated the power of the Soviet state.

After crushing the foreign armed interventionists and the White Guards, the Communist Party launched a massive construction effort, guiding the people's boundless creativity toward the realization of Lenin's plan for building socialism in the Soviet state. Lenin's scientifically formulated and proven program for transforming economically backward Russia into an advanced, powerful socialist power stipulated the implementation of socialist industrialization of the country, vigorous development of heavy industry, electrification of the entire national economy, the realization of a cooperative plan to transform our agriculture according to socialist principles, and the realization of a cultural revolution.

After the death of Lenin, the founder of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, the vicious enemies of socialism—Trotskyites, Bukharinites, and bourgeois nationalists—launched a frenzied attack on the Party, deliberately trying to lead the Party and the state away from Lenin's path and towards the path of burying the achievements of the proletarian revolution and restoring capitalism. Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Stalin, the Communist Party smashed the traitors and capitulationists, defended Leninism, and bravely and resolutely led the people of the Soviet state onto the victorious road of building socialism.

Based on Lenin's instructions, Stalin demonstrated the path and methods of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization. The Party implemented the policy of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and in a short historical period transformed the Soviet Union into a mighty socialist power.

The victory of socialism brought about fundamental changes in the economic and social class structure and in the relations between nationalities. The Soviet socialist system is the most progressive social and state system. It has forever eliminated the exploitation of man by man and established the indestructible spiritual and political unity of the entire Soviet society.

The Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union was the most severe test of the strength and vitality of the Soviet social system. The historic victory achieved by the Soviet people in this war is inseparable from the name of Stalin. According to the decision of the Party Central Committee, Stalin led the State Defense Committee and the Soviet armed forces.

During the post-war period, the Soviet people put in tremendous efforts to eliminate the heavy consequences of the war. The iron will of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and the selfless and heroic labor of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, overcame everything. The level of economic development that had been interrupted by the war has been far surpassed by the peaceful and constructive labor of the Soviet people.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has consistently taken the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin as the guide for all its activities. Stalin was an outstanding propagandist of Leninism. He set an example of cherishing Lenin's legacy, defended the purity of Leninism, and waged a resolute struggle against all enemies of Leninism. In his theoretical works, Stalin very powerfully revealed the treasures of Leninism, which are the greatest asset of the Communist Party.

Stalin always regarded Marxism-Leninism as a creative science that is constantly developing in close connection with life and with the revolutionary practice of the masses.

He, following Lenin, often emphasized that theory is not a dogma but a guide to action, and in all his activities he demonstrated the model of creatively applying the theory of Marxism-Leninism. He was able to skillfully apply the theory of Marxism-Leninism in formulating and proving the Party's policies, and in solving the practical tasks of socialist construction.

Stalin summarized the extremely rich practical experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and the experience of the modern international liberation movement, and adapted to the new historical conditions, creatively developed the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and enriched it with new principles on many issues. In his works, Stalin further developed Lenin's theories on the Marxist party of a new type, on proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, on the strategy and tactics of the proletarian class struggle, and on the socialist state.

The great Lenin comprehensively explored the issue of the leading role of the working class and the alliance of the working class with the basic masses of the peasantry. Stalin repelled the attacks of the Trotskyist-Bukharinist hostile group, resolutely defended Lenin's idea of the worker-peasant alliance, and actively participated with other leaders of the Party and the state in activities to thoroughly realize Lenin's ideas. The Communist Party tempered the firm alliance of the working class and the working peasantry, and transformed this alliance into a decisive force guaranteeing the building of socialism in the Soviet Union. This great force is the source of new victories on the brilliant road of building communism.

Lenin formulated for the first time in history the theory, program and tactics of the Party on the national question, and pointed out that the national question is an integral part of the overall revolutionary struggle of the working class for the dictatorship of the proletariat and for socialism. He was the inspirer of the policy of equality and friendship among all nationalities. Lenin's programmatic principles on the national question have been further creatively developed in Stalin's works and Party resolutions. Stalin tirelessly worked to consolidate the indestructible friendship of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, because he believed that this was the source of the invincible strength of the multinational Soviet state.

Based on the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, the founders of true scientific political economy, and on the basis of summarizing the new experience of historical development and the new practical struggle experience of the working class and its Communist Party, Stalin put forward and developed a series of new principles in economics.

Guided by Lenin's instructions on the economic essence of imperialism, Stalin expressed the basic law of modern capitalism and analyzed in detail the general crisis of the capitalist system that envelops the capitalist economy and politics.

Based on the basic principles in the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, Stalin expressed the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy.

In Stalin's works, Lenin's principles on socialist management methods, on the necessity of utilizing the law of value and currency, on economic accounting, and on the principle of making staff members concerned about the results of their labor from the perspective of material interests were further explored.

Lenin developed and summarized the theory of scientific communism, and formulated the basic principles on the path to building a communist society, on the role of electrification and increasing labor productivity in establishing the material and productive basis of communism, and on the conditions for transitioning to the communist principle of distribution according to needs. Stalin developed and specified the laws governing the development of socialist society and the gradual transition of socialist society to communism in the Marxism-Leninism.

Based on a deep knowledge of objective economic laws, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has formulated policies that are scientifically based and verified by practice. The Party's policy reflects the requirements of the development of society's material life and the fundamental interests of the people.

The Soviet state is becoming increasingly prosperous and is confidently moving towards communism.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government consider the people's desire for peaceful labor and for constantly improving the material and cultural level of the working people to be sacred and inviolable. The Party and the government have always resolutely pursued a policy of peace and friendship among all peoples. This policy is based on Lenin's instructions on the long-term peaceful coexistence of the two systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system. Stalin fought unswervingly to realize the Soviet Union's peace-loving foreign policy.

Closely united with the Soviet Union in a fraternal manner to fight for peace are the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia. The powerful camp of peace and socialism has now united more than 900 million people. The strong will of the people of the socialist camp to safeguard peace was demonstrated with new strength at the recent European conference of European countries in Moscow to ensure peace and security. The declaration of the eight governments stated: "The people of our countries are willing to live in peace and maintain friendly relations with the people of other countries. Precisely for this reason, they will continue to make unremitting efforts to defend the interests of peace and universal security, and will take all necessary measures to ensure the peaceful development of their countries in the future and the due security of their own countries."

The reason why the Communist Party has been able to guide the Soviet Union to achieve victories of world historical significance is that it is the advanced team of the workers, and it has always relied on the trust of the people and on the creative initiative of millions of people. The Party is deeply convinced of the power of the people and the revolutionary perseverance of the people. The Party is closely and inseparably linked with the people. The great unity of the Party, the government, and the people is the vigorous source of all our victories.

    斯大林是列宁事业的伟大继承者
    苏联　普·卡培林
    斯大林把自己的一生贡献给了解放工人阶级和全体劳动人民，使其免受剥削者压迫的崇高事业，贡献给了为人民的幸福、为共产主义的胜利的斗争。斯大林的生平活动是全心全意为人民服务，无限忠实于百战百胜的马克思列宁主义学说的鼓舞人心的榜样。
    斯大林的革命工作，开始于列宁为在俄国建立一个革命的马克思主义无产阶级政党——新型的政党——而展开了巨大斗争的时期。斯大林在自己的革命活动的初期，便对列宁的天才充满了无限的信心，毅然决然地走上了列宁的道路。斯大林把列宁看作是最高典型的领导者，是个山鹰，他在斗争中不知恐惧为何物，而大胆引导党向俄国革命运动从未经过的道路前进。斯大林称自己为列宁的学生，并认为自己终生的目标就是作一个名副其实的列宁的学生，无论在何时、何地，他始终是具有坚定信念的列宁主义者，是列宁主义思想的忠诚继承者。
    马克思、恩格斯的学说和事业的天才继承者——列宁，在新的历史条件下创造性地发展了马克思主义。他创立了关于马克思主义新型政党的学说，制定了这个党的思想、组织、策略与理论的基础。他为了反对公开的和暗藏的马克思主义的敌人，反对工人运动中形形色色的机会主义表现，为了把无产阶级的力量组织、团结在革命的马克思主义旗帜下而展开了无情的斗争。在为建立马克思主义工人阶级政党的斗争中，斯大林是列宁的忠实战友。
    伟大列宁所缔造和锻炼出来的共产党，领导了俄国各族人民走向十月社会主义革命的胜利。俄国无产阶级同劳动农民结成联盟，在以列宁为首的共产党的领导下树立了最伟大的历史功勋——第一个冲破了世界帝国主义阵线，确立了无产阶级专政，从而开辟了人类历史的新纪元——资本主义崩溃和共产主义胜利的纪元。
    由于十月革命的胜利，在历史上便建立起一个新型的国家——工农社会主义国家。在建设和巩固苏维埃国家中，在捍卫年青的苏维埃共和国免遭内外反革命的破坏中，斯大林是列宁的最亲密的助手。
    列宁领导的共产党，在把苏维埃共和国联合成一个统一的联盟国——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟——方面进行了巨大的工作。斯大林在实现这个历史任务上起了卓越的作用。苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的建立是共产党的列宁、斯大林民族政策的胜利。联盟的建立无限地巩固了苏维埃国家的威力。
    在粉碎了外国武装干涉者和白卫分子之后，共产党开展了巨大的建设工作，把人民的无穷创造力导向实现列宁关于在苏维埃国家建设社会主义的计划。列宁所制定并在科学上论证了的把经济上落后的俄国变成先进的、雄伟的社会主义强国的纲领，规定要实行国家的社会主义工业化、大力发展重工业、实行整个国民经济的电气化、实现按社会主义原则改造我国农业的合作社计划并实现文化革命。
    在共产党和苏维埃国家的奠基人列宁逝世后，社会主义的凶恶敌人——托洛茨基分子，布哈林分子，资产阶级民族主义者——对党进行了猖狂的攻击，他们蓄意使党和国家离开列宁的道路而走向葬送无产阶级革命成果和使资本主义复辟的道路。在以斯大林为首的中央委员会的领导下，共产党粉碎了叛徒和投降分子，捍卫了列宁主义，勇敢而坚决地领导苏维埃国家的人民走上了胜利的建设社会主义的大道。
    斯大林根据列宁的指示，论证了国家的社会主义工业化和农业集体化的道路和方法，党实现了国家工业化和农业集体化的政策，在短暂的历史时期内便把苏联变成了雄伟的社会主义强国。
    社会主义的胜利使经济、社会的阶级结构和各民族的相互关系起了根本的变化。苏维埃社会主义制度是最进步的社会制度和国家制度，它永远消灭了人对人的剥削，建立了整个苏维埃社会的不可摧毁的精神上和政治上的一致。
    苏联的伟大卫国战争是苏维埃社会制度的力量和生命力的最严重的考验。苏联人民在这次战争中所取得的历史性胜利是同斯大林的名字分不开的，斯大林根据党中央的决议，领导了国防委员会和苏联武装力量。
    战后期间，苏联人民付出了巨大的精力去消灭战争带来的沉重后果。共产党和苏联政府的钢铁般的意志，工人、集体农民和知识分子的忘我的英勇劳动战胜了一切。苏维埃人的和平建设性劳动为战争中断时所达到的经济水准，已远远地落在后面了。
    苏联共产党始终不渝地以马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的学说作为自己全部活动的指南。斯大林是列宁主义的卓越的宣传家。他树立了珍爱列宁的遗产的范例，捍卫住了列宁主义的纯洁，同列宁主义的一切敌人进行了坚决的斗争。斯大林在自己的理论著作中非常有力地揭示出作为共产党最伟大的财产的列宁主义的宝藏。
    斯大林一向都把马克思列宁主义看作是在同生活、同群众的革命实践密切联系中不断发展着的创造性的科学。
    他继列宁之后经常强调指出，理论不是教条而是行动的指南，并在自己的全部活动中表现为创造性地运用马克思列宁主义理论的典范。他在制定和论证党的政策时，在解决社会主义建设的实际任务时，能巧妙地运用马克思列宁主义的理论。
    斯大林总结了苏联社会主义建设的极其丰富的实际经验和现代国际解放运动的经验，适应新的历史条件，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义理论，并在许多问题上以新的原理丰富了它。斯大林在其著作中进一步发展了列宁关于马克思主义新型政党、关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政、关于无产阶级阶级斗争的战略和策略、关于社会主义国家的学说。
    伟大的列宁全面地探讨了关于工人阶级起领导作用的工人阶级同农民基本群众的联盟问题。斯大林击退了托洛茨基—布哈林敌对集团的攻击，坚决地捍卫了列宁的工农联盟思想，并与党和国家的其他领导者一起积极地参加了彻底实现列宁的思想的活动。共产党锻炼了工人阶级同劳动农民的巩固联盟，并把这个联盟变成一种保证在苏联建成社会主义的决定性力量。这一伟大力量就是在建设共产主义的光辉道路上取得新胜利的源泉。
    列宁在历史上首次制定了党在民族问题方面的理论、纲领和策略，并指出，民族问题是工人阶级为无产阶级专政、为社会主义而进行的总的革命斗争中的一个组成部分。他是各民族平权、友好的政策的鼓舞者。列宁在民族问题上的纲领式的原理，在斯大林的著作及党的决议中获得了进一步的创造性的发展。斯大林不倦地为巩固苏联各民族的不可摧毁的友谊而工作，因为他认为这是多民族的苏维埃国家的不可战胜的力量的源泉。
    斯大林依据真正的科学的政治经济学的创始人马克思、恩格斯和列宁的著作，并在总结历史发展的新经验、工人阶级及其共产党的新的实际斗争经验的基础上，在经济学方面提出并发展了一系列新的原理。
    斯大林以列宁关于帝国主义的经济本质的指示为指南，表述了现代资本主义的基本法则，并详细地分析了笼罩着资本主义经济和政治的资本主义体系的总危机。
    斯大林根据马克思、恩格斯和列宁的著作中的基本原理，表述了社会主义基本经济法则和国民经济有计划、按比例发展的法则。
    在斯大林的著作中，进一步探讨了列宁关于社会主义经营管理方法、关于利用价值法则和货币的必要性、关于经济核算制、关于使工作人员从物质利益上来关怀自己劳动成果的原则等原理。
    列宁发展和总结了科学共产主义的理论，制定了关于建成共产主义社会的途径、关于电气化和提高劳动生产率在建立共产主义的物质生产基础中的作用、关于过渡到按照需要进行分配的共产主义原则的条件等基本原理。斯大林发展了并具体化了马克思列宁主义关于社会主义社会发展的规律性和社会主义社会逐步向共产主义过渡的原理。
    苏联共产党根据客观经济法则的深刻知识，制定了有科学根据并经过实践验证的政策。党的政策反映着社会物质生活发展的要求，反映着人民的根本利益。
    苏维埃国家的威力日益昌盛，目前正满怀信心地向共产主义前进。
    共产党和苏维埃政府认为人民对保卫和平的劳动和不断提高劳动者的物质和文化水平的愿望是神圣不可侵犯的，党和政府始终不渝地实行着和平和各国人民友好的政策。这个政策是以列宁关于两种制度——社会主义制度和资本主义制度——可以长期和平共处的指示为出发点的。斯大林曾坚定不移地为实现苏联的爱好和平的对外政策而斗争。
    同苏联兄弟般亲密地团结一致共同为和平而斗争的，还有欧亚两洲的人民民主国家。强大的和平和社会主义阵营现在已联合了九亿多人。社会主义阵营各国人民维护和平的坚强意志，于不久前在莫斯科举行的保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家会议上，以新的力量表现了出来。八国政府宣言中说道：“我们各国人民愿意和其他各国人民和平相处并保持友好关系。正因为这样，他们将继续不断尽力捍卫和平和普遍安全的利益，并将采取一切必要的措施，以保证他们的国家今后的和平发展和他们本国应有的安全。”
    共产党之所以能引导苏联取得了具有世界历史意义的胜利，由于它是劳动者的先进队伍，它始终依靠着人民的信任，依靠千百万人民的创造积极性。党深信人民的力量和人民的革命毅力。党同人民紧密地不可分割地联系在一起。党、政府同人民的伟大团结一致，是我们获得一切胜利的蓬勃的源泉。
