    On a Route of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Tan Peizhang

    From Beijing to Kashgar
    Not long ago, I embarked on a meaningful journey on a Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company route leading to the northwest of our country.

    In the morning, the plane smoothly left the runway, ascended, ascended, and rose to an altitude of 1,500 meters. After I had a bird's-eye view of the entire Summer Palace from the plane window, the plane left our beloved capital and flew to Lanzhou. Unless there is a sudden change in the air current layer, the plane always flies very smoothly. You can walk around in the cabin, or read and write. The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company has flown more than ten million kilometers in four years without any flight accidents, which cannot be found in the aviation history of old China.

    Flying over the fertile mountains and fields of the motherland, we soon arrived in Lanzhou.

    Lanzhou Station is surrounded by the Yellow River Valley, bordering the Gannan mountainous area to the south, connecting to the Inner Mongolia desert to the north, adjacent to Huajialing to the east, and leaning against Wushaoling to the west. Regional meteorological changes vary greatly, and clouds and fog often replace the clear sky, filling the nearby routes, which increases the difficulty of flying. A deputy stationmaster at Lanzhou Station said: "These difficulties have been resolved with the help of Soviet comrades. Our careful meteorological management and strict adherence to technical regulations ensure flight safety."

    The next morning, we changed to aircraft "09" and flew away from Lanzhou. We passed over Wushaoling, which is more than 3,000 meters above sea level, and saw the Qilian mountain peaks covered with snow all year round. With the assistance of the Soviet pilot, Sun Quangui, the Chinese co-pilot, steadily controlled the flight of aircraft "09." More than two hours later, we landed at Jiuquan Station. This was the first time on our journey that we had seen an airport built on the Gobi Desert. It connects the aviation lines from inside the pass to outside the pass, and also supports the construction of the Yumen Oil Mine. The mining equipment transported by air to the Yumen Oil Mine is all unloaded here. More than four years ago, this was still a gravel Gobi Desert with no water, no grass, and no people, but today, the Chinese and Soviet staff at the station do not feel lonely in this environment. In addition to actively completing the work of the airport, they also transport soil from far away to plant more than two thousand trees. Now the green trees are waving in the wind. Every Sunday, the basketball court and the club present a lively scene. They can see movies and also go hunting in the nearby mountains.

    Continuing west from Jiuquan, passing Jiayuguan, the starting point of the Great Wall, and crossing Xingxingxia, we flew into the Xinjiang Province. Looking at the ground from the plane window, in addition to a winding Gansu-Xinjiang Highway, the boundless desert and Gobi Desert occupied more than two flying hours.

    We arrived in Hami in the afternoon. This airport is also built on the Gobi Desert. Chinese and Soviet staff are building a paradise for civil aviation work in this place. In a beautiful two-story building, there are offices, a club, Chinese and Western dining halls, and a small shop that sells fresh Hami melons, which passengers from inside the pass buy to taste. We were lodged in a clean guest house. Opening the white curtains, we could see the distant Tianshan Mountains covered with snow, which were even more moving and picturesque in the setting sun. At night, the airport lights were on. From more than ten kilometers away, people could see the bright lights in the buildings here. The staff at Hami Station provide very attentive service to the passengers. I saw a passenger, Cao Guanjun, writing in the passenger comment book: "I got sick after getting off the plane. Comrade Wang Xiuying, the waitress, brought the food to my room. I am really grateful to her." One night at Hami Station, we didn't feel like we were staying on the Gobi Desert, but rather like we were living in a modern city. The staff at Hami Station told me that Soviet comrades are very serious about serving the passengers. They make everything comfortable for the passengers, so that they can recover from the fatigue of the journey. Every clean bed must be changed with washed and sun-dried white sheets and pillowcases the day after the passenger has stayed.

    Take off again from Hami Station. From the plane, we saw the towering trees and tidy farmlands around Hami City, and also saw the eighty-kilometer-long Red Star Canal, which was dug by the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang a few years ago. This Red Star Canal draws snow water from the Tianshan Mountains to irrigate the farmland in southern Hami. Near the suburbs of Hami, we can also see small hills almost connected in a line, which are the famous karez wells in Xinjiang. This is a water conservancy irrigation project combining surface shafts and underground canals, and it is also a great symbol of the struggle between the people of Xinjiang and drought throughout history.

    After two hours of flying, the city of Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Province, came into our sight.

    Ma Rui, the person in charge of Urumqi Airport, accompanied us to visit various facilities of the airport. On the grassland west of the airport, we saw a tent with an area of three square meters made of oilcloth and blankets. This is a homing beacon to help aircraft clarify the direction during flight, and it can accommodate one person working inside. For the past year or two, the homing staff have been working here, persisting in homing work in the severe cold of minus forty degrees, which really surprised and impressed us. Now, not far from this tent, a new homing station equipped with heating stoves has been built. The severe cold cannot stop the strong spirit of the comrades working in the border areas.

    After staying in Urumqi for a few days, we flew to southern Xinjiang, which accounts for three-fifths of the total population of Xinjiang.

    The snow on the peaks of the Bogda Mountains in the Tianshan Mountains, more than 3,000 meters above sea level, shone with crystal clear light under the sunlight. We flew over the Bosteng Lake, which is rich in fish. When flying over Kuqa and Aksu stations, the planes landed for refueling. These two stations were built last year on the Gobi Desert, overcoming many difficulties. At 4:00 p.m., Kashgar time, which is almost three hours later than Beijing time, the plane flew over the airport on the Kashgar River. We saw the majestic Pamir Plateau peaks, and were proud of the vastness of the motherland. After landing at the airport, we took a car to the largest city in southern Xinjiang, and also the westernmost city in our country—Kashgar City. After staying at the Kashgar Guest House of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company, we went out and strolled on the streets lined with towering poplars. We saw the bustling square in the city center and the Aitika Grand Mosque, which can accommodate more than 3,000 people. We also ate large pomegranates weighing one kilogram, sweet figs, and delicious roasted mutton. At night, the street speakers were broadcasting Yue Opera. It turned out that the four cinemas in Kashgar today were all showing the film "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai." The films here are all transported by plane. The people of Kashgar love this film. Although they don't understand Yue Opera, there is a Uyghur interpretation during the screening. This film continued to be shown until 12:00 p.m., and the speakers also broadcasted until late at night.

    Civil Aviation Serving the People

    The opening of the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company's route from Beijing to the Northwest has created favorable conditions for the construction of Xinjiang. In cities in Xinjiang with airports, people can see the "People's Daily" published in Beijing within three to seven days; if transported by train or car, it would take at least twenty days to one and a half months. In Yili City, in the northwest corner of Xinjiang, people see the "People's Daily" earlier than the "Xinjiang Daily" published in Urumqi, because the "People's Daily" uses air transport. This spring, the Northwest route undertook the task of transporting representatives of the people across the country to Xinjiang to visit the Chinese People's Liberation Army, shortening the visiting time by more than 40 days. At the same time, it transported more than 4,000 kilograms of gifts, so that the soldiers guarding the border received gifts from the heart of the motherland, Beijing, in a timely manner. This summer, when the draft constitution was announced, people in remote areas of Xinjiang also quickly learned this great document. I remember that on the way from Lanzhou to Hami by plane, I also saw many film reels transported from Beijing to Urumqi, as well as the Uyghur version of Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" sent by the Nationalities Publishing House to Kashgar City in southern Xinjiang.

    On this Northwest route, the Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company undertook transportation tasks that other means of transportation could not replace. It once transported two hundred blue Hami sheep from Yili, Xinjiang, to the Northeast to catch the mating season. This type of sheep can produce an average of 12 catties of wool per year. After the promotion of this type of sheep, wool production can be increased, and the national wool textile industry can be developed. In January of this year, the airline safely transported more than 1,000 kilograms of silkworm eggs from Zhejiang to southern Xinjiang in airplanes with insulation equipment. I met Wang Jinzhou, the director of the Hotan Silkworm Seed Farm in Xinjiang, on the plane. He said, "Using airplanes, silkworm eggs from East China can be transported to southern Xinjiang, helping ethnic minorities develop the silkworm breeding business." The Sino-Soviet Civil Aviation Company has also transported sea hares from the Northeast to Urumqi to make serum, and transported daily necessities from Shanghai and other cities to Urumqi to supply the needs of urban and rural areas in the border areas. Various meteorological equipment, industrial and agricultural products, and cultural products are transported from inside the pass, all of which meet the needs of building Xinjiang. In particular, the transportation of industrial equipment promptly meets the production needs of certain factories in Xinjiang. The large quantities of medicines transported by air guarantee the health of the people in the border areas, and the large amount of air mail enhances communication between people who are far apart. The Urumqi-Almaty route often transports a large number of international mail and newspapers, enhancing the cultural exchanges between the people in our border areas and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries.

    Last autumn, the 1,380-kilometer route from Urumqi to southern Xinjiang was opened. For more than a year, the load of each flight has been full. Important industrial and agricultural products, medical supplies, newspapers and magazines, and mail are air transported from the mainland to Kashgar, bringing this border city closer to the interior of the motherland through aviation.

    Precious Friendship Between the Chinese and Soviet People

    During this pleasant journey, I saw that on the 4,600-kilometer route from Beijing to Kashgar, our country's aviation talents are growing rapidly with the help of Soviet comrades. I deeply feel the precious friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, which has set another brilliant example in our country's civil aviation industry.

    Soviet comrades working at Lanzhou Station not only ensure flight safety, but also help Chinese staff continuously improve their skills technically. Li Shengrong, a probationary radio mechanic who can now work independently, was originally a cleaning worker in the Lanzhou Station guest house. He grew up farming and herding, and had not attended school. He only learned a few years of culture after joining the revolution. At the suggestion of radio chief technician Klimovich, he was transferred to the radio center transmitting station to study. From the spring of last year to the spring of this year, he learned how to connect circuits, manage internal combustion engines, and change wavelengths. Klimovich often took a translator to the transmitting station to guide him, and also disassembled the internal combustion engine to explain the principles to him. Li Shengrong has been awarded the third-class merit in the company's 1954 annual awards for his achievements in learning technology from Soviet comrades.

    At Hami Station, I saw the stationmaster Cui Keji. When he was transferred to Hami in 1950, he knew nothing about airport work. However, under the painstaking cultivation of Soviet experts, he now has a preliminary understanding of aircraft maintenance, radio communications, airport management, flight dispatch, and mastering meteorological changes, which are the work that a stationmaster has to do. Through hard work, Cui Keji can now direct the landing and take-off of aircraft in the airport tower. Usually, Soviet experts also constantly tell him how to direct aircraft when the weather is bad, and that all the plans of the airport chief in his work must be for the safety of the flight. When the aircraft is coming or taking off, any irrelevant things must be put down to do the command work well. Bereberizin, the current Soviet deputy stationmaster of Hami Station, said to Stationmaster Cui: "Our purpose in coming to China is to help you master the technology. Now that you can lead the work of this airport, I can return to my country." Originally, he was really about to be transferred, but Comrade Bereberizin, in order to help Stationmaster Cui master the flight command in the harsh winter climate, was approved by the head office to stay in Hami for the winter. What a welcome thing this should be for Stationmaster Cui!

    The Soviet comrades at Urumqi Airport provide the same earnest help to our country's staff as the situation at the several airports seen along the way. Ahmat Kemek, a Uyghur working at this port, grew from an airport worker to an aviation mechanic with the help of Soviet comrades. He repeatedly told me that the painful life under the oppression of landlords in childhood compared with today being able to assist in repairing airplanes is truly a stark contrast between pain and joy. Chen Ying, a probationary radio mechanic, felt infinitely reluctant to part with a Soviet radio technician who recently left her and returned to his country. On the day this technician left, she carefully asked her if there was anything she didn't understand that could be answered before saying goodbye.

    Among the Chinese staff at Urumqi Airport, there was a popular saying: "Friendship is as deep as the sea, the benefits are endless, and the technology is inexhaustible." This is the high respect expressed by our country's civil aviation industry to the Soviet comrades.

    在中苏民航公司的一条航线上
    新华社记者　谈培章
    从北京到喀什
    不久前，我从北京出发，在通向我国西北的一条中苏民用航空公司航线上，作了一次有意义的旅行。
    早晨，飞机平平地离开了地面跑道，升高，升高，升上了一千五百公尺上空。我从机窗里鸟瞰了颐和园的全景后，飞机就离了我们可爱的首都飞向兰州去。只要不是空中气流层的突变，飞机总是飞得很平稳。在机舱里可以走动，也可以看书、写字。中苏民用航空公司四年来飞行一千几百万公里，没有发生过任何飞行事故，这在旧中国的航空历史上是找不到的。
    飞越过祖国肥沃的山野，不久我们就到了兰州。
    兰州站围在黄河河谷内，南接甘南山区，北连内蒙古沙漠，东临华家岭，西靠乌鞘岭，地区性的气象变化悬殊，云雾常常代替晴空布满附近航线，增加了飞行中的困难。兰州站的一位副站长说：“这些困难在苏联同志的帮助下，都得到了解决。我们周密的气象管理和严格地遵守技术规程，保证了飞行的安全。”
    第二天清晨，改乘“○九”号机飞离兰州，经过拔海三千多公尺的乌鞘岭，又望见了积雪终年的祁连山峰。中方副驾驶员孙全贵在苏方驾驶员的帮助下，很平稳地掌握了“○九”号机的飞行。两个多小时后，在酒泉站降落。这是我们旅行中第一次见到建筑在戈壁滩上的航空站，它连结了关内通向关外的航空线，同时也支援了玉门油矿的建设，玉门油矿空运的矿业器材都是在这里卸货的。四年多前，这儿还是无水、无草、无人的砾石戈壁，可是今天，站上的中苏工作人员并不对这个环境感到寂寞，他们在积极完成航空站工作之暇，还从很远的地方运泥土来，栽种了两千多棵树。现在绿树已在迎风招展。每到星期天，篮球场上和俱乐部里就呈现一片活跃。他们可以看到电影，还到附近山中去打猎。
    从酒泉继续西飞，掠过万里长城的起点嘉峪关，穿过星星峡，我们便飞进了新疆省境。从机窗里向地面眺望，除了一条蜿蜒如带的甘新公路外，一望无际的沙漠、戈壁滩占去了两个多飞行小时。
    下午到达了哈密。这个机场也是建筑在戈壁滩上，中苏工作人员就是在这块地方建设民航工作的乐园。在一座美丽的二层楼建筑中，有办公室、俱乐部、中西食堂和小卖部，小卖部里出售新鲜的哈密瓜，从关内来的旅客都要买来尝尝。我们被留宿在整洁的旅客招待所中，拉开白窗帘，可以看到远方积雪的天山在夕阳映照下更为动人如画。入夜，机场的电灯亮了，从十多公里以外，人们就可以看到这里楼房中的明亮灯光。哈密站的工作人员对来往旅客服务得很周到，我在旅客意见簿上看到一位旅客曹冠军写着：“我下飞机后生病了，女招待员王秀英同志把饭菜端到房间里来，我真感谢她”。哈密站的一晚，我们感觉不到这是住宿在戈壁滩上，倒像是生活在现代化的城市中一样。哈密站的工作人员告诉我，苏联同志对为旅客服务的工作是非常认真的。样样都使旅客过得舒适，能够恢复旅途的疲劳。每一个整洁的床铺，在旅客住过后的第二天一定要换上洗晒过的洁白床单和枕套。
    从哈密站继续起飞。在飞机中看到了哈密城周围参天的树木，整齐的田园，也看到了前几年人民解放军驻新疆部队开凿的八十公里长的红星渠。这条红星渠引天山的雪水灌溉着哈密南部的农田。在哈密近郊还能看到几乎连成一线的小山丘，原来就是新疆有名的坎儿井。这是一种地面直井和地下暗渠相结合的水利灌溉工程，也是新疆人民历来和干旱斗争的伟大标志。
    飞行二小时后，新疆省会乌鲁木齐市映入了我们的眼帘。
    乌鲁木齐航空港的负责人马瑞同志陪我们参观了航空港的各种设备。在机场西边草原上，我们看到一座用油布和绒毯搭成的三平方公尺面积的篷帐，这是帮助飞机在飞行中明确方向的定向台，里边可以容纳一个人工作。一、二年来，定向员就在这里，在零下四十度的严寒中坚持定向工作，这真使我们感到惊奇和敬佩。现在，在这篷帐不远的地方，一座新的有暖炉设备的定向台建筑起来了。严寒阻挡不了在边疆工作的同志们的坚强精神。
    在乌鲁木齐逗留几天，我们又飞向占全疆人口五分之三的南疆去。
    拔海三千多公尺的天山搏格多山峰上的积雪，在阳光下闪烁着晶莹皓洁的光辉。我们飞过鱼产丰富的博斯腾湖上空。当飞过库车、阿克苏站时，飞机都降落加油，这两个站都是去年从戈壁滩上克服了许多困难建筑起来的。下午四时，喀什的时间比北京差不多要迟三小时，飞机飞临喀什噶尔河畔的机场上空，我们望见了巍峨高大的帕米尔高原的峰，为祖国土地的辽阔广大而骄傲。在机场降落后，我们就乘汽车到南疆最大的城市，也是我国最西部的一个城市——喀什城里去。在中苏民用航空公司的喀什招待所住下后，就出门漫步在白杨参天的马路上。我们看到了城中心热闹的广场和可以容纳三千多人的艾提卡大礼拜寺，也吃到一斤重的大石榴、甜甜的无花果和鲜美的烤羊肉。入夜，街头的播音器在转播越剧。原来，今天喀什的四个电影院都在上演“梁山伯与祝英台”的影片。这里的影片都是由飞机运来的，喀什的人民喜爱这部影片，他们虽然不懂越剧，但在放映中有维文解释。这部影片一直连续放映到深夜十二时，播音器也转播到深夜。
    为人民服务的民航事业
    中苏民用航空公司由北京通向西北航线的开辟，对新疆的建设创造了有利的条件。凡是新疆有航空站的城市，在三天到七天内就能看到北京出版的“人民日报”；如果用火车、汽车运送，最少也得二十天到一个半月。在新疆西北角的伊犁城，看到“人民日报”就比乌鲁木齐出版的“新疆日报”早，因为“人民日报”利用了空运。今年春天西北航线担负了运送全国人民慰问中国人民解放军代表到新疆各地的任务，缩短了慰问时间计四十多天，同时运送了四千多公斤的慰问品，使守卫边疆的战士及时得到从祖国心脏北京送去的礼品。今年夏天宪法草案公布时，在新疆边远地区的人民，也很快地学到了这个伟大的文件。记得自兰州搭机往哈密途中，我还看到了许多从北京运往乌鲁木齐的电影片，也有民族出版社寄往南疆喀什城的周总理“政府工作报告”的维文版型。
    在这条西北航线上，中苏民用航空公司担负过其他运输工具所不能代替的运输任务，曾经把新疆伊犁的两百只蓝哈羊运到东北去赶交配期。这种绵羊平均每年可产羊毛十二市斤，推广这种绵羊以后，就可以使羊毛增产，发展全国的毛织工业。今年一月间，航空公司把浙江的一千多公斤蚕种放在有保温设备的飞机中，安全地运到了南疆。我在飞机中遇到新疆和阗蚕种场场长王金洲，他说：“利用飞机，华东的蚕种可以运到南疆，帮助了少数民族发展养蚕事业。”中苏民用航空公司也曾经把东北的海兔运到乌鲁木齐去造血清，把上海等城市的日用品运到乌鲁木齐供给边疆城乡的需要。从关内运来各种气象器材、工农业用品、文化用品，都适应了建设新疆的需要，特别是运送工业器材，及时满足了新疆某些工厂的生产需要。空运来的大批药品，保证了边疆人民的健康，大量的航空邮件增进了相隔遥远的人们的通讯。乌鲁木齐通往阿拉木图的航线，经常运进大量的国际邮件和书报，增进了我国边疆人民和苏联及其他人民民主国家的文化交流。
    去年秋天，由乌鲁木齐通向南疆一千三百八十公里的航线开辟了。一年多来，每次班机的载重都是满满的，从内地空运来喀什的，有工农业重要用品、医药用品、书报杂志、邮件等，通过航空把这个边疆城市更紧密地和祖国内地联系起来了。
    中苏人民珍贵的友谊
    在这次愉快的旅行中，我看到从北京到喀什长达四千六百多公里的航线上，我国航空人材在苏联同志的帮助下成长得很快。我深深感到中苏两国人民珍贵的友谊，在我国民用航空事业上树立了另一个光辉的榜样。
    在兰州站工作的苏联同志，一面保证飞行的安全，一面从技术上帮助中国工作人员不断提高水平。已经能单独当班的见习无线电机械员李生荣原来是兰州站招待所的清洁工人，从小种地牧羊，没有上过学，参加革命后才学了几年文化。他在无线电主任技术员格力莫维赤的建议下，调到无线电中心发射台学习。从去年春天到今年春天，他就学会了如何接线路、管理内燃机和调换波长的工作。格力莫维赤经常带了翻译员到发射台去指导他，还把内燃机拆下来讲原理给他听。李生荣由于向苏联同志学习技术有成绩，已经被评为公司一九五四年度的三等功臣。
    在哈密站我看到站长崔克己。他从一九五零年调来哈密时，对航空站工作一点也不懂。可是在苏联专家们的苦心培养下，如今他已初步懂得飞机维护、无线电通讯、机场管理、飞行签派和掌握气象变化等站长要做的工作。崔克已经过努力的学习，能在机场塔台上指挥飞机的降落和起飞了。平时，苏联专家还不断向他讲到在天气不好的时候怎样指挥飞机，讲到航空站长在工作上的一切打算都要为了飞行的安全，飞机要来到了，要起飞了，任何不相干的事情都要放下来把指挥工作做好。现任哈密站苏联副站长别列别里津对崔站长说：“我们来中国的目的是帮助你们掌握技术，现在你们已能领导这个航空站的工作，我也可以回国去了。”本来他真是就要调走了，可是别列别里津同志为了帮助崔站长熟练掌握冬季恶劣气候的飞行指挥，就经总公司批准留在哈密过冬天。这对崔站长说来该是一件多么欢迎的事情！
    乌鲁木齐航空港的苏联同志，对我国工作人员的认真帮助是和途中看到的几个航空站情况一样的。在这个港工作的我国维吾尔族人阿合买提·柯美可，就是在苏联同志帮助下，从机场小工成长起来的航空机械员。他一再告诉我，童年时代在地主压迫下的痛苦生活同今天能协助修理飞机来比，真是一桩痛苦和愉快的鲜明对比。见习无线电机械员陈瑛，对最近离开她回国的一位苏联无线电技术员，感到无限的留恋，当这位技术员离开的那一天，还仔细问她还有什么不懂的地方，可以作一次告别前的解答。
    乌鲁木齐航空港的我国工作人员，曾流行这么一句话：“友谊深如海，好处说不尽，技术学不完”。这就是我国民航事业界对苏联同志们表示的崇高的敬意。
