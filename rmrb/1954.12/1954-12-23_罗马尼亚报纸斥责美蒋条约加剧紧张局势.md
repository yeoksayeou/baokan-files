Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 20th: "Free Romania" published an article by I. Grasse, Professor of International Law at the Bucharest Bahon University. The article said that the U.S. government's conclusion of a "Mutual Defense Treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek, as well as its reliance on a voting machine in the United Nations to reject the Soviet Union's proposal to stop acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China and determine the responsibility of the U.S. naval fleet for these actions, were all aimed at diverting the attention of peace-loving people from the aggressive forces' attempt to create a hotbed of war in the Chinese seas centered on Taiwan.

	The article said that the London and Paris Agreements, aimed at immediately reviving the West German Defense Forces, like the pirate actions of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the Chinese seas, are part of the same policy of aggressive forces seeking to intensify international tensions and prepare for new wars.

	The article said that the United States attempts to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, infringe upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, interfere in China's internal affairs, prepare to expand aggression against China, deepen the danger of war in the Far East, and exacerbate international tensions by concluding a "Mutual Defense Treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek. This action by the United States violates the basic principles of universally recognized international law.

	The article emphasized that all the aggressive plans plotted by the instigators of a new world war will be met with a powerful counterattack by the people of all countries. The pirate actions in the Chinese seas and the criminal acts of violating China's airspace will obviously not stop the Chinese people from exercising their right to liberate Taiwan.

    罗马尼亚报纸斥责美蒋条约加剧紧张局势
    【新华社二十二日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特二十日讯：“自由罗马尼亚报”刊载了布加勒斯特巴洪大学国际法教授伊·格拉塞的一篇文章。文章说，美国政府同蒋介石缔结“共同防御条约”，以及它在联合国依靠表决机器否决苏联提出的制止对中华人民共和国的侵略行为和确定美国海军舰队对这些行动应负的责任的建议，都是为了转移爱好和平的人民对侵略势力企图以台湾为中心在中国海面组成战争温床的注意。
    文章说，以立即复活西德国防军为目的的伦敦协定和巴黎协定，同蒋介石集团在中国海面进行的海盗行动一样，是追求加剧国际紧张局势和准备新战争的侵略势力的同一政策的一部分。
    文章说，美国企图以同蒋介石缔结“共同防御条约”来阻挠中国人民解放台湾，侵犯中国的主权和领土完整，干涉中国内政，准备扩大对中国的侵略，加深远东的战争危险，和加剧国际紧张局势。美国的这种行动，违背了一致公认的国际法中的基本原则。
    文章强调说，但是，新的世界大战的挑拨者所策划的一切侵略计划，都将遭到各国人民的强大力量的回击。在中国海面进行的海盗行动和侵犯中国领空的罪恶行为，显然不能阻挡中国人民履行解放台湾的权利。
