Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 10th: Ichiro Hatoyama, President of the Democratic Party of Japan, with the support of both the left and right-wing Socialist Parties, defeated Ichiro Ogata, President of the Liberal Party, in the House of Representatives of the Diet on the evening of the 9th by a vote of 257 to 191 and was elected as the new Prime Minister of Japan.

According to the agreement between the Democratic Party of Japan and the left and right-wing Socialist Parties, the Hatoyama Cabinet will be a temporary cabinet. The joint statement issued by the three parties stated that after the formation of the Hatoyama Cabinet, the Diet will be dissolved at the beginning of next year, and the general election will be completed before the beginning of March next year.

After being elected Prime Minister, Hatoyama delivered a radio address to the nation that evening. He stated that he would develop "economic diplomacy" and would strive to open up "deadlocked Japanese diplomatic relations." At the same time, he said that he would continue to base Japan's foreign policy on "cooperation with non-communist countries." Regarding domestic economic policy, Hatoyama said that because Japan is facing a period of economic crisis, it is still necessary to practice "thrift and simplicity." According to International News Service, Hatoyama told reporters that the relationship between Japan and the United States would not change, but he would try to make "some changes" to the currently severely restricted trade relations between Japan and China.

Mosan Suzuki, Chairman of the Left-wing Socialist Party, said that his party's support for Hatoyama as Prime Minister does not mean support for Hatoyama's political program. Jotaro Kawakami, Chairman of the Right-wing Socialist Party, announced that the Socialist Party's task is to promote the speedy dissolution of the Diet.

Kyodo News Agency said that the Hatoyama Cabinet "is a cabinet that manages the general election" and "cannot expect to stabilize the political situation as a result."

    日本民主党总裁鸠山一郎
    当选日本新首相
    【新华社十日讯】东京消息：日本民主党总裁鸠山一郎在左、右派社会党的支持下，九日晚在国会众议院以二百五十七票对一百九十一票击败自由党总裁绪方竹虎，当选日本的新首相。
    根据日本民主党和左、右两派社会党的协议，鸠山内阁将是一个临时性的内阁。三党发表的联合声明说，鸠山内阁组成后要在明年年初解散国会，并且在明年三月上旬以前完成大选。
    鸠山在当选首相后，当晚向全国发表广播演说。他表示将发展“经济外交”，并且要努力打开“陷于僵局的日本外交关系”。同时，他说，他将继续使日本的外交政策以“同非共产党国家合作”为基础。国内经济政策方面，鸠山说，因为日本正面临经济危机时期，所以还要“节约和简朴”。据国际新闻社报道，鸠山向记者表示，日本和美国的关系不致改变，但他将设法使日本和中国的目前受到严格限制的贸易关系有“一点改变”。
    左派社会党主席铃木茂三郎说，他的党支持鸠山任首相，绝不等于支持鸠山的政纲。右派社会党主席河上丈太郎宣布，社会党的任务就是促使从速解散国会。
    共同社说，鸠山内阁“是管理大选的内阁”，“不能希望就此稳定政治局势”。
