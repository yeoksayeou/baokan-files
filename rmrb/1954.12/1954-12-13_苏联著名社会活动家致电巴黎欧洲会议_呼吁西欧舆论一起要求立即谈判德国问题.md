Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 11th: According to TASS, prominent Soviet social activists who were unable to attend the European Conference in Paris against the rearmament of West Germany due to visa issues—writers Ilya Ehrenburg and Alexander Korneychuk, Academician Alexander Oparin, Chairman of the Soviet Chamber of Commerce Mikhail Nesterov, and journalist Yuri Zhukov—sent a telegram to the European Conference in Paris on the 11th, congratulating the conference on its opening.

The telegram stated: "We deeply regret that, due to circumstances known to you all, we have been deprived of the opportunity to participate in your conference. We believe that a gathering of representatives of Eastern and Western public opinion at this extremely difficult time will help to resolve the issues related to the future of Europe. We hope that this conference, attended only by representatives of Western European countries, can still play a significant role in uniting Europe and preventing the dangers that now threaten the peoples of Europe."

The telegram then addressed some of the issues raised by the organizers of the conference in their invitation, stating: "We believe that the unresolved German question remains the main obstacle to consolidating peace in Europe, but we believe that it is now more possible than ever to resolve this issue through negotiations between the Four Powers. Our government has consistently advocated holding such negotiations and is prepared to discuss any proposals from any participant in the Four Power Conference. The Four Power Conference will discuss how to organize free elections in Germany in the short term to establish a unified Germany and facilitate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. According to this treaty, a unified Germany should be a peaceful country, not participate in any military blocs, and not become a threat to its neighbors."

The telegram stated: "We believe that stopping the rearmament of Germany and giving it every possibility to peacefully develop its economy is in the interests of the German people themselves and the interests of all the peoples of Europe. Resolving the German question in this way would facilitate a general agreement among all European countries on a substantial reduction in armaments and the establishment of an effective collective security system."

The telegram stated: "Now, the only obstacle hindering the resolution of the German question is the plan to arm West Germany and bring it into a military bloc. It is quite obvious that the implementation of this plan cannot but prompt East Germany to also arm itself and join another bloc composed of countries that consider West German remilitarization a threat to themselves. All of this means deepening the division of Germany, intensifying the expansion of armaments, and exacerbating the dangers of the 'Cold War'."

The telegram warned people not to believe the claims of some political figures in Western European countries that ratifying the Paris Accords would not hinder future negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German question, saying: "We know the mood of the Soviet public, and therefore we warn against believing such rash predictions, because the situation created by the ratification of the above-mentioned accords would make negotiations impossible."

The telegram emphasized that it is not too late to prevent something irreversible from happening. We are convinced that there is an opportunity to reach an agreement on the German question before the Paris Accords are ratified.

The telegram concluded: "We firmly believe that the public opinion of Western European countries will join us in firmly demanding that negotiations begin immediately."

    苏联著名社会活动家致电巴黎欧洲会议
    呼吁西欧舆论一起要求立即谈判德国问题
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：因领不到签证不能去巴黎参加反对武装西德的欧洲会议的苏联著名社会活动家——作家伊利亚·爱伦堡、亚历山大·考涅楚克，科学院院士亚历山大·奥巴林，苏联商会主席米哈伊尔·涅斯捷罗夫，记者尤里·茹科夫十一日打电报给巴黎欧洲会议，祝贺会议的召开。
    电文说：“我们十分遗憾，由于你们大家所知道的情况，我们被剥夺了参加你们会议的机会。我们认为，在现在这个极端困难的时候，东方和西方舆论代表的集会将有助于解决那些关系欧洲前途的问题。我们希望，你们这个只有西欧各国代表参加的会议仍然能够在团结欧洲和防止那种现在正威胁着欧洲各国人民的危险的事业中起重大的作用。”
    电文接着谈到对于这个会议发起人在邀请书中所提出来的一些问题的观点，电文说：“我们认为，德国问题没有能够解决，始终是巩固欧洲和平的主要障碍，但是我们相信，现在比任何时候都有可能通过四大国谈判的方法来解决这个问题。我国政府一贯建议举行这种谈判，并且准备讨论四国会议任何参加者的任何建议。而四国会议将讨论如何在短期内组织德国自由选举，以便建立一个统一的德国，促成缔结对德和约。根据这个条约，统一后的德国应该是一个和平国家，不参加任何军事集团，不得成为对它的邻国的一种威胁。”
    电文说：“我们认为，制止武装德国和给它以一切可能性来和平发展自己的经济，是既符合德国人民自己的利益，也符合欧洲一切国家人民的利益的。以这样的方式解决德国问题，就可以促成欧洲一切国家就大大裁减军备和建立有效的集体安全体系达成普遍的协议。”
    电文说：“现在，妨碍解决德国问题的唯一障碍是武装西德和把它拉入军事集团的计划。十分明显，实现这个计划，不能不促使东德也进行武装，并且促使它参加由那些认为西德重新军国主义化是对自己的威胁的国家所组成的另一个集团。所有这一切都意味着加深德国的分裂，加剧扩充军备和加剧‘冷战’的危险性。”
    电文警告人们不要听信西欧国家的某些政治人物关于批准巴黎协定似乎不会妨碍今后和苏联谈判德国问题的说法，电文说：“我们是知道苏联公众的情绪的，因此我们警告不要相信这一类的轻率的预言，因为批准上述协定所造成的局面会使得谈判成为不可能。”
    电文强调指出：现在来防止那种难以挽回的事情还不算晚。我们断定在批准巴黎协定之前，就德国问题达成协议的机会是存在的。
    电文最后说：“我们坚信，西欧各国的舆论将和我们一起来坚决要求立即开始举行谈判。”
