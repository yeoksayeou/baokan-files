The Chinese edition of "Stalin's Collected Works," Volume 10, has been published and will be available in Xinhua bookstores across the country from mid to late December.

"Stalin's Collected Works," Volume 10, includes the author's works from August to December 1927.

By the end of 1927, the Soviet Union's policy of socialist industrialization had achieved decisive success. The total output of industry and all agriculture (including forestry and fishing) had not only reached but exceeded pre-war levels.

The great achievements of Soviet industrialization made the international bourgeoisie even more hostile to the Soviet Union. They believed that the progress of Soviet socialist industrialization and the increasing consolidation of the Soviet regime threatened the survival of capitalism. Therefore, they used every means to provoke an anti-Soviet war. While threatening the Soviet Union with war, the international bourgeoisie also used their agents, the Trotskyites and Zinovievites, to create divisions within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, attempting to undermine socialist construction, destroy the Soviet regime, and restore capitalism in the Soviet Union.

The CPSU(B), "proceeding from the Leninist principle that our country possesses all that is necessary and sufficient for building a completely socialist society," under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Stalin, defended Leninism, crushed the class enemies and their running dogs, the Trotskyites and Zinovievites, defeated the various provocations and attacks from the capitalist encirclement, and guided the Soviet people to firmly advance along the road of socialist construction.

During this period, although both industry and agriculture in the Soviet Union developed, agriculture, especially in grain production, still lagged far behind industry. The Fifteenth Congress of the CPSU(B) established the policy of agricultural collectivization. In his political report to the Congress on behalf of the Central Committee, Stalin summarized the achievements of socialist construction in the Soviet Union under capitalist encirclement and analyzed the reasons for the slower development of Soviet agriculture compared to nationalized industry, thereby putting forward the historical task of agricultural collectivization, pointing out that the only way out for agriculture was to lead small-scale farming onto the path of collectivization. He said that the way out was to unite scattered small farmers into collective farms using agricultural machinery and tractors through demonstration and persuasion. At the same time, he pointed out that it was necessary to control agriculture from the outside, namely from supply and marketing, and from the inside, namely from agricultural production. These instructions became the fundamental policies and guidelines for the socialist transformation of agriculture.

In his report, Stalin profoundly analyzed the international environment in which the Soviet Union was situated at that time, the situation of the world revolutionary movement, especially the situation of the Chinese revolution, and pointed out that a new upsurge and victory of the Chinese revolution would inevitably come.

In his report to the Fifteenth Congress of the CPSU(B) and the conclusion on that report, in the "Joint Plenum of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission of the CPSU(B)," in the "Speech of August 5th" and "On the 'Declaration' of the Opposition of August 8, 1927," in the "Political Physiognomy of the Russian Opposition," "The Past and Present of the Trotskyist Opposition," "The Party and the Opposition," and other speeches and writings, Stalin thoroughly exposed the anti-Soviet and traitorous essence of the Trotskyite gang. He not only ideologically crushed Trotskyism but also put forward to the Party the task of organizationally crushing and eliminating the Trotskyist-Zinovievite anti-Soviet alliance, emphasizing the necessity of constantly struggling for the unity and iron discipline of the Bolshevik Party ranks.

In his "Conversation with the First American Workers' Delegation," Stalin pointed out the inseparable unity between Marxism and Leninism, clarified the new things that Lenin added to the general treasure house of Marxism by adapting and developing the doctrines of Marx and Engels to the new era, namely the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, and gave a classic definition of the new problems Lenin added to Marxism. In the conversation, Stalin, based on the instructions of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and using the experience of Soviet socialist construction, elaborated on the distinct characteristics of communist society.

In his articles such as "The International Character of the October Revolution," "Conversation with Foreign Workers' Delegations," and "The International Situation and the Defense of the USSR," Stalin pointed out the historical significance of the great October Socialist Revolution for the world and the necessity for the working people of all countries to defend the Soviet Union from imperialist aggression. Stalin pointed out that the October Revolution should not be regarded as a revolution that was only "within the scope of one country"; it was first and foremost an international and worldwide revolution, because it was a fundamental transformation in the history of all mankind from the old capitalist world to the new socialist world. The October Socialist Revolution broke through the world imperialist front and for the first time in human history raised the oppressed and exploited classes to the position of ruling classes, seizing political power. And "the very existence of the 'Bolshevik state' restrains the dark forces of reaction and facilitates the struggle of the oppressed classes for their own liberation." Therefore, supporting the Soviet Union and resolutely defending it in the event of an imperialist armed attack was the sacred task of the proletariat and working people of all countries. The attitude towards the Soviet Union was the touchstone for testing the revolutionary nature of all kinds of groups, factions, and parties.

The article "Statement to Representatives of Foreign Newspapers Regarding the Forgery of the 'Stalin Thesis'," included in "Stalin's Collected Works," Volume 10, powerfully exposed the habitual tactics of international bourgeoisie in spreading rumors and slanders.

In his letter "To Comrade M.I. Ulyanova, In Reply to Comrade L. Mikhelson," Stalin clarified the question of the elimination of national and state differences.

The works contained in "Stalin's Collected Works," Volume 10, are a huge theoretical treasure, a scientific summary of the experience of the Soviet Union in building a socialist society.

### “斯大林全集”第十卷中文版出版

第3版()
专栏：

    “斯大林全集”第十卷中文版出版
    “斯大林全集”第十卷中文版已经出版，自十二月中旬和下旬起开始在全国各地新华书店发行。
    “斯大林全集”第十卷包括著者一九二七年八月到十二月的著作。
    到一九二七年末，苏联的社会主义工业化政策已经获得具有决定意义的成就，工业和全部农业（包括森林业和渔业）的出产总量已经不仅达到，而且超过了战前水平。
    苏联工业化事业的伟大成就，使国际资产阶级更加仇视苏联，他们认为苏联社会主义工业化的进展和苏维埃政权的日益巩固对于资本主义的生存是一种威胁，因此采取一切办法企图挑起反苏战争。国际资产阶级在对苏联进行战争威胁的同时，并利用他们的代理人托洛茨基、季诺维也夫分子在苏联共产党内制造分裂，企图使社会主义建设垮台，苏维埃政权灭亡，资本主义在苏联复辟。
    联共（布）“从我们国家具备着建成完全的社会主义社会所必需的和足够的一切这一列宁主义原理出发”，在以斯大林同志为首的中央委员会领导之下，保卫了列宁主义，粉碎了阶级敌人及其走狗托洛茨基、季诺维也夫分子，击溃了资本主义包围的各种挑衅、袭击，引导苏联人民沿着建设社会主义的道路坚定地迈进。
    在这个时期，苏联的工业和农业虽然都有发展，但农业，特别是在谷物生产方面，还远落在工业之后。联共（布）第十五次代表大会确定了农业集体化的方针。斯大林在向代表大会所做的中央委员会的政治报告中，总结了在资本主义包围的条件下苏联社会主义建设的成就，分析了苏联农业的发展比国有化工业的发展缓慢的原因，从而提出了农业集体化的历史任务，指出只有把小农经济引上集体化的道路才是农业的出路。他说，出路就是通过示范和说服的方法，把分散的小农户联合为使用农业机器和拖拉机的集体农庄。同时他指出，一方面要从外部、即从供销上来掌握农业，另一方面要从内部，即从农业生产上来掌握农业。这些指示都成为农业的社会主义改造的根本政策和方针。
    斯大林在报告中深刻地分析了当时苏联所处的国际环境，世界革命运动的情况，特别是中国革命的形势，指出中国革命的新高潮和胜利必将到来。
    斯大林在向联共（布）第十五次代表大会所做的报告和关于该报告的结论中，在“联共（布）中央委员会和中央监察委员会联席全会”、“八月五日的演说”和“关于反对派一九二七年八月八日的‘声明’”中，在“俄国反对派的政治面貌”、“托洛茨基反对派的过去和现在”、“党和反对派”等演说及其他著作中，彻底揭露了托洛茨基匪帮反苏叛逆的本质，不仅从思想上彻底击溃了托洛茨基主义，并且向党提出了从组织上粉碎和消灭托洛茨基—季诺维也夫反苏维埃联盟的任务，着重指出为布尔什维克党的队伍的统一和铁的纪律而不断斗争的必要性。
    斯大林在“和第一个美国工人代表团的谈话”中，指出马克思主义和列宁主义之间的不可分割的统一关系，阐明列宁适应新时代即帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代发展马克思、恩格斯学说而加进马克思主义总宝库中去的新东西，并给列宁对马克思主义所补充的新问题下了经典式的定义。斯大林在谈话中根据马克思、恩格斯、列宁的指示，利用苏联社会主义建设的经验，阐述了共产主义社会鲜明的特征。
    斯大林在“十月革命的国际性质”、“和外国工人代表团的谈话”、“国际形势和保卫苏联”等文中指出伟大十月社会主义革命对于世界的历史意义和世界各国劳动者保卫苏联免受帝国主义侵犯的必要性。斯大林指出，十月革命不能认为只是“一国范围内的”革命，它首先是国际性的、世界性的革命，因为它是全世界人类历史中从资本主义旧世界到社会主义新世界的根本转变。十月社会主义革命冲破了世界帝国主义战线而使被压迫被剥削阶级在人类历史上第一次升到了统治阶级的地位，掌握了政权。而“‘布尔什维克国家’存在这一事实就牵制着黑暗的反动势力而便利于被压迫阶级为自己的解放而斗争”。因此拥护苏联并在帝国主义武装进攻苏联时坚决保卫它，乃是各国无产阶级和劳动人民的神圣任务。对待苏联的态度是检验各种各样的集团、派别和政党的革命性的试金石。
    载入“斯大林全集”第十卷的“就伪造‘斯大林论文’事向外国报刊代表发表的声明”一文，有力地揭露了国际资产阶级造谣诽谤的惯技。
    斯大林在“致玛·依·乌里杨诺娃同志。答勒·米赫里逊同志”的信中阐明了民族差别和国家差别消灭的问题。
    “斯大林全集”第十卷所载各篇著作是巨大的理论财富，是苏联建成社会主义社会的经验的科学概括。
