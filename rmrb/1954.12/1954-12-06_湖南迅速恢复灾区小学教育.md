    湖南迅速恢复灾区小学教育
    湖南省水灾区小学教育的恢复工作，进展很快。据南县、华容、沅江等十个县的统计，已经恢复的完全小学有八十六所，初小八百一十七所，约占受灾区小学的半数以上。
    在恢复灾区教育的工作中，各地党、政领导机关和群众给予很大的关心和帮助，教师们也作了艰苦的努力。中共南县二区区委书记吴蔚明为使麻河口完全小学按时开学，发动了白蚌口、武圣宫、麻河口三镇的建筑工人帮助学校修整校舍。益阳三区岭湖乡的农业生产合作社和互助组出工帮助修复学校；一区第三中心学校朗灵分校教师亲自动手做泥砖，糊、砌墙，把学校收拾得很好。
    湖南各地小学校根据因陋就简的原则初步解决了校舍、校具、教具等问题，学生们已开始入学。
