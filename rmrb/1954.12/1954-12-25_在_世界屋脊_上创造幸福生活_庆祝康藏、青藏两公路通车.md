Creating a Happy Life on the "Roof of the World"
    — Celebrating the Opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang Highways

    The Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway have both been opened to traffic across their entire length.

    The Kangzang Highway starts from Ya'an and ends in Lhasa, with a total length of 2,255 kilometers and an average elevation of over 3,000 meters. The Qingzang Highway starts from Xining and ends in Lhasa, with a total length of 2,100 kilometers and an average elevation of over 4,000 meters. These are two highways with long mileage, high elevation, and difficult construction that are rare in the world. The opening of these two highways has further strengthened the connection between Tibet and the interior of the motherland, enhanced the unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities and among the nationalities in the Qinghai, Kangding, and Tibetan regions, and has a significant role in the development of the national economy and culture, and in promoting the economic and cultural development of the people of Tibet and the peoples of the Qinghai, Kangding, and Tibetan regions.

    Since the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was reached in 1951, the history of the Tibetan nationality has entered a new era. The unity between the Tibetan nationality and the Han people and other nationalities of the motherland has never been as solid as it is today; the political, economic, and cultural ties between Tibet and the interior of the motherland have never been as close as they are today. Chairman Mao pointed out when the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was reached: "This kind of unity is a brotherly unity, not one side oppressing the other. This kind of unity is the result of the common efforts of all parties. In the future, on the basis of this unity, our nationalities will achieve development and progress in all aspects, in politics, economy, culture, and all other aspects." The success of the construction of the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway is undoubtedly an important milestone in this progress and development.

    For thousands of years, between the closely linked Qinghai, Kangding, and Tibetan regions, and between Tibet and the interior of the motherland, towering mountains and turbulent rapids have hindered the close exchanges between the Tibetan people and the people of the interior of the motherland. Although, for many years, people have yearned in myths and ballads for the giant bridges erected over rapids and the avenues traversing mountain ridges; and some people have made suggestions and published articles advocating the construction of a highway to Tibet. However, before today, there has never been a highway on the Tibetan plateau. The reactionary rulers of the past precisely used the traffic obstruction to create division, poverty, and backwardness in Tibet and other areas inhabited by fraternal nationalities, in order to implement their policy of cruelly oppressing and exploiting all minority nationalities. This ugly history is now forever over.

    From the day the People's Republic of China was founded, it declared that all nationalities are equal, and the domestic ethnic relations have undergone fundamental changes. The Communist Party and the Central People's Government have never ignored the serious phenomenon of uneven development in the economic, cultural, and other aspects among the various nationalities caused by long-term historical reasons, and have always tirelessly devoted themselves to helping the people of all minority nationalities develop political, economic, cultural, educational, and other construction undertakings. From 1950 to 1951, the Central Government instructed the Chinese People's Liberation Army entering Tibet to begin surveying and constructing the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway while marching into Tibet. Today, these two highways are open to traffic, and the long-cherished hope of the Tibetan people has been realized. The completion of these two highways further demonstrates the ethnic policy of the Communist Party and the Central People's Government. It is the crystallization of the unity of all nationalities in our country. This kind of unity was impossible in any previous era.

    The opening of the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway will be the beginning of further development of Tibet's economic and cultural construction undertakings. In the past three years, Tibet's economic and cultural undertakings have made some major achievements. Trade has become active, and agricultural production has developed. The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops entering Tibet have turned tens of thousands of acres of wasteland into fertile fields and tried planting more than 300 varieties of crops. Tibetan people's primary schools have been successively established in major cities in Tibet. In 1953, the number of Tibetan people who received free medical treatment at people's hospitals and clinics in various places reached more than 250,000. More than ten animal disease prevention and control institutions have treated and prevented more than 90,000 sick and injured livestock in 1953. The face of Tibet has undergone important changes.

    However, due to long-term historical reasons, Tibet's economy and culture are still backward after all. Some areas still use ancient and outdated production tools and farming methods, with extensive planting and meager harvests, or even extensive planting and no harvest. Industrial products from other regions of the country are difficult to transport to Tibet, and Tibet's native products and specialties are also difficult to transport out. Therefore, the production technology in the Tibetan region is still very backward, and the living standards of the Tibetan people are still very low. After the opening of the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway, the journey from Ya'an or Xining to Lhasa, which used to take several months on yaks, mules, and horses, can now be reached by car in just over ten days; the materials that used to require dozens of yaks to carry can now be transported by just one car. This will enable Tibet's economic and cultural construction undertakings to receive more and faster assistance from the interior of the motherland; it will further activate the connections in all aspects of the Qinghai, Kangding, and Tibetan regions. This kind of economic and cultural connection will be a huge force for the development of Tibet's construction undertakings. And the development of new economic factors will undoubtedly have a broad impact on politics and culture.

    The construction of the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway is a great project rarely seen in the history of highway construction. The high mountains and turbulent rivers of Tibet once intimidated many travelers and explorers, let alone opening up highways on these high mountains and turbulent rivers. A book published in 1930, "A Complete Account of Tibet," described Tibet's transportation as: "Rocks crisscross, roads for people and horses are cut off, the dangers are numerous, and the situation is indescribable"; "No one in the world who comes here does not tremble with fear." But today, the heroes who built the roads, following the instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao, climbed onto this awe-inspiring "Roof of the World," and with heroic spirit, they uttered a great roar: "Let the high mountains bow their heads, and let the rivers give way!" They finally split apart the strangely shaped cliffs, overcame the raging torrents, blocked the overwhelming sandstorms, crossed the sweeping glaciers, penetrated the dark forests, and filled in the difficult-to-walk swamps; allowing the wide and flat highway to be paved on the "Roof of the World." The hardships they experienced and the great achievements they made are unforgettable to us. Taking the Kangzang Highway as an example, the amount of earth and stone excavated for the roadbed alone was 29 million cubic meters, which is about the same as excavating a canal 15 meters wide, 3 meters deep, and 1,300 li long.

    In those days of intense construction, there were many heroes and good men like the crossing-the-Yangtze hero Li Wenyan and the exploration hero Cui Ximing, who went to the most difficult places to open up roads for the construction team; there were also selfless people like Zhang Fulin, who dedicated their lives to the construction of the highway. These heroes who built the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway are the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. They demonstrated the tenacious perseverance and infinite wisdom of the Chinese people, set a vivid example for us, and proved that no difficulty can stop our socialist construction undertakings from advancing bravely.

    The Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway are now open to traffic across their entire length. We would like to pay tribute to the commanders and fighters, logistics workers, workers, engineering and technical personnel, and migrant workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who built these two highways! Pay tribute to all the staff who served for the construction of these two highways! Pay tribute to the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the Qinghai, Kangding, and Tibetan regions who supported the construction of these two highways! Pay tribute to the workers who produced machinery, road-building tools, and other materials for the construction of these two highways, and to the farmers who produced food for the road-building personnel! Pay tribute to the Soviet experts who went to the site to guide the construction despite their hard work!

    We must continue to strive to consolidate the unity of all nationalities in the motherland and to build a happy life for the Tibetan people! Create a brand new life on the "Roof of the World"!

    Long live the great unity of the people of all nationalities in the country!

    在“世界屋脊”上创造幸福生活
    ——庆祝康藏、青藏两公路通车
    康藏公路和青藏公路都已全线通车了。
    康藏公路起自雅安，终于拉萨，全长二千二百五十五公里，平均海拔高达三千公尺以上。青藏公路起自西宁，终于拉萨，全长两千一百公里，平均海拔高达四千公尺以上。这是举世罕有的两条里程长、海拔高、工程艰巨的公路。这两条公路的通车，更密切了西藏地方和祖国内地的联系，更加强了藏、汉两族和青、康、藏地区各民族间的团结，对于全国经济和文化的发展，对于促进西藏人民以及青、康、藏地区各民族人民的经济、文化的发展，都有重大作用。
    自从一九五一年和平解放西藏办法的协议达成以后，西藏民族的历史进入一个崭新的时代。西藏民族和汉族人民及祖国其他民族的团结，从来没有像今天这样巩固；西藏地方和祖国内地在政治上、经济上、文化上的联系，从来没有像今天这样密切。毛主席在和平解放西藏办法的协议达成的时候就已指出：“这种团结是兄弟般的团结，不是一方面压迫另一方面。这种团结是各方面共同努力的结果。今后，在这一团结基础之上，我们各民族之间，将在各方面，将在政治、经济、文化等一切方面，得到发展和进步。”康藏公路和青藏公路建设的成功，无疑地是这一进步和发展的重要的里程碑。
    几千年来，在紧相毗连的青、康、藏三地之间，在西藏和祖国的内地之间，重重高山，滔滔激流，阻挡着西藏人民和祖国内地人民的密切往来。虽然，多少年来人们在神话里、在歌谣里，都向往着那架在激流上的巨桥，那翻越山岭的大道；也曾有人提过建议，发表过文章，主张修筑一条通向西藏的公路。可是，今天以前在西藏高原上始终还没有一条公路。过去的反动统治者，正是利用着交通阻塞的情况，在西藏和其它兄弟民族聚居的地方，制造分裂、穷困和落后，以便实现他们残酷地压迫和剥削各少数民族的政策。这一丑恶的历史现在是永远结束了。
    中华人民共和国从成立的那一天起，就宣布了各民族一律平等，国内的民族关系起了根本的变化。共产党和中央人民政府从来也没有忽视由于长期的历史原因所造成的各民族间经济、文化等方面发展不平衡的严重现象，从来就不懈地致力于帮助各少数民族的人民大众发展政治、经济、文化、教育等建设事业。在一九五零年至一九五一年，中央就指示进藏的中国人民解放军，在进军的同时开始康藏公路和青藏公路的勘测和施工工作。今天，这两条公路通车了，西藏人民梦寐以求的希望实现了。这两条公路的建成，进一步表现了共产党和中央人民政府的民族政策。它是我国各民族团结的结晶。这种团结是过去任何年代所不可能达到的。
    康藏公路和青藏公路的通车，将是西藏经济和文化建设事业进一步发展的开端。三年多以来，西藏的经济和文化事业都有了若干重大成就。贸易活跃起来了，农业生产发展了。进藏的中国人民解放军部队把数万亩荒地变成了良田，试种了三百多样品种的农作物。藏族人民的小学校在西藏的各主要城市陆续举办起来了。一九五三年经各地人民医院及门诊所免费治疗疾病的藏族人民即达二十五万余人次。十多个兽疫防治机构在一九五三年内，防治了病伤牲畜九万多头。西藏的面貌已有了重要的改变。
    但是由于长期的历史原因，西藏的经济和文化毕竟还是落后的，有些地区还沿用着古老陈旧的生产工具和耕作方法，广种薄收，甚至广种无收。国内其他地区的工业品很难运到西藏，西藏的土产和特产也很难运出来。因此，西藏地区的生产技术还十分落后，西藏人民的生活水平也还很低。康藏公路和青藏公路通车以后，过去由雅安或西宁到拉萨乘骑牦牛、骡马要走好几个月时间的路程，现在乘坐汽车只要十余天就可到达；过去要几十匹牦牛驮载的物资，现在只用一辆汽车就能装运。这就将使西藏的经济和文化建设事业，更多地、更迅速地得到祖国内地的帮助；将进一步活跃青、康、藏地区各方面的联系。这种经济上和文化上的联系，对于西藏建设事业的发展，将是一种巨大的力量。而新的经济因素的发展，无疑地又将对政治和文化各方面发生广泛的影响。
    建设康藏公路和青藏公路是公路建筑史上少有的伟大工程。西藏的高山激流就曾吓倒了许多旅行家和探险家，更不要说是在这高山激流上开辟公路。一九三零年出版的“西藏始末记要”一书，形容西藏的交通说：“乱石纵横，人马路绝，艰险万状，不可名态”；“世上无论何人，到此未有不胆战股栗者”。但是今天，筑路的英雄们遵循着党和毛主席的指示，爬上了这使人望而生畏的“世界屋脊”，他们以英雄的气概，发出了伟大的吼声：“让高山低头，叫河水让路”。他们终于劈开了奇峰峭壁的大山，战胜了奔腾叫嚣的激流，挡住了排山倒海的流砂，越过了席卷而下的冰川，穿开了不见天日的森林，填实了举步难行的泥沼；让宽广平坦的公路铺筑在“世界屋脊”上了。他们所经历的艰难困苦，所建树的丰功伟绩，是我们永志难忘的。拿康藏公路来说，光是所挖路基的土方和石方，就有二千九百万方，要是开一条十五公尺宽、三公尺深、一千三百里长的运河，挖出的土方和石方也不过如此。
    在那些紧张施工的日子里，有许多像渡江英雄李文炎，探险英雄崔锡明一样的英雄好汉，朝着最困难的地方走，替施工队伍开辟道路；也有一些像张福林那样的忘我的人，把自己的生命贡献给公路的建设。这些建筑康藏公路和青藏公路的英雄们，是我国人民的优秀儿女，他们显示了中国人民坚韧的毅力和无穷的智慧，为我们树立了生动的榜样，证明没有什么困难能够阻挡我们社会主义建设事业的勇往直前。
    康藏公路和青藏公路都已全线通车了。我们谨向修筑这两条公路的中国人民解放军指战员、后勤工作者、工人们、工程技术人员和民工们致敬！向为这两条公路的建设而服务的一切工作人员致敬！向支援这两条公路建设的西藏人民和青、康、藏地区的各族人民致敬！向为这两条公路的建设而生产机械设备、筑路工具和其他物资的工人们，以及为这两条公路的筑路人员生产粮食的农民们致敬！向不辞辛劳、亲赴现场指导施工的苏联专家致敬！
    我们要为巩固祖国各民族的团结，为建设西藏人民的幸福生活而继续奋斗！在“世界屋脊”上创造崭新的生活吧！
    全国各民族人民大团结万岁！
