Fujian Chinese Fir Growth Rate Unprecedented in China

According to actual measurement surveys conducted by the Fujian Provincial Forestry Department's Forest Survey Team, the growth rate of Chinese fir in the northern part of Fujian Province is rarely seen in the country.

During an inspection in Shunchang County, the survey team conducted a typical investigation of the reserve volume of a Chinese fir forest planted 25 years ago in Xietun Township. The results showed that the reserve of some plots had reached 689 cubic meters per hectare, with an average annual growth of 27.6 cubic meters. This growth rate is about 30 times faster than the growth rate of trees in the cold regions of northern China. It is also about twice as fast as the usual Chinese fir reserve growth rate in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, which are rich in Chinese fir south of the Yangtze River.

At the same time, the survey team also discovered that the growth of pine forests and miscellaneous forests such as chinquapin, oak, Phoebe, maple, and schima, which account for most of the forest area in the province, also differs from other places. In other regions, these natural secondary forests are mostly small in diameter, have many branches, and have curved trunks. However, the trees in Fujian Province generally grow rapidly, have excellent materials, with some tree diameters reaching 40 to 50 centimeters or even more than one meter, and tree heights reaching more than 10 meters to more than 30 meters. Moreover, the tree trunks are generally relatively straight, making them very valuable for utilization.

    福建杉木成长速度国内罕见
    据福建省林业厅林野调查队的实测调查，福建省北部一带杉木成长速度为国内少见。
    调查队在顺昌县勘查时，曾对谢屯乡一片栽下二十五年的杉木林作蓄积量典型调查，结果发现，每公顷蓄积多的已达到六百八十九立方公尺，平均每年生长二十七点六立方公尺。这样的增长速度比我国北部寒冷地带林木的生长速度约快三十倍。比长江以南盛产杉木的湖南、江西省通常杉木蓄积量增长速度也快一倍左右。
    同时，调查队还发现占省内森林中大部分面积的松木林和槠、栲、楠、枫香、木荷等杂木林生长情况与别地也有不同。在旁的地区，这种天然次生林木多是直径小、分叉多、树干弯曲，而福建省的这些林木一般成长迅速，材质优良，树径有的达四五十公分以至一公尺以上，树高达十多公尺到三十多公尺，而且树干一般较为耸直，利用价值很大。
