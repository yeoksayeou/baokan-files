Ode - In Celebration of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China
  　XU Shuren
    The sun is rising. The beautiful five-star flag flutters in the sunlight and brilliant rosy clouds; the gentle mist disappears into the distant horizon; the rooster crows continuously. Motherland, which the people have been calling for for thousands of years! The beautiful rivers and mountains awaken in this golden morning; the bright red fruits, heavily bending the green branches; hope and memories, surge and interweave in my heart.
  As if a brilliant picture composed of different colors,
  As if a harmonious symphony composed of different sounds, different ethnic groups make up our country. All ethnic groups cheer and welcome you, the first Constitution of the motherland! On the grassland, steeds gallop, conveying this joyous news; the old man, with his white beard fluttering, proudly rides on horseback. All songs burst into jubilation. With the ringing of the strings, the news stirs the grasslands, startling herds of cattle and sheep. The smoke and dust of war have passed! Light hooves crush the morning dew on the golden needle flowers. Larks pour out wonderful and joyful melodies from the invisible heights. The bright red grassland - immersed in newly brewed wine. Flow, flow, Kur River! The willow branches on the border sway with wisps of green smoke and white clouds; above the mine shaft, the sun peeps at the changing dance and flickers with the double reflections of poplar trees in the oil river. On the flowering lawn, the sound of drums shakes the mountains and forests; in the deep valleys, echoes resonate everywhere.
  "The Miao people are coming down the mountain!" The Lusheng flute answers affectionately. Happy people, dance and sing all night until dawn. Peacocks fly. White lotuses bloom in the fire. Newly dug canals are irrigating this plateau. Our Constitution is written on Mount Everest, and the eternal North Star shines on it in the dark night. Countless crowds come in wild cheers; the people of all China advance under the light of the Constitution. The scorching sun shines on the beads of sweat on the forehead, the unified pace - oh listen! Listen, listen, listen! Who called the ingenious weaver girl to weave this chapter of victory with clouds and rosy clouds! I see a rainbow high across the clear sky, building a bridge to the future. Between workshops, roses are exuding fragrance. On a bright summer night, everything is singing. Hundreds of millions of people have a constitution today; all the gears and axles will vibrate more happily. The blueprint of the motherland unfolds in the boundless blue sky. Meticulous design: grand and detailed. The stars in the sky sow seeds of joy; happy souls are flying between the stars. Everything here is in its proper place. I look at the forest of chimneys. In the sky above the city, the lights of the night shine red in the distance. I hear the constant humming: the heart of the city is pulsing. It is the people, the ordinary people, who have personally written the glorious and happy chapter. I imagine a brand new, complete motherland, like a finished product just inspected and qualified, placed in our hands. I hear songs from all directions, like the spring tide of rivers, flowing through the snow-capped peaks of the Kunlun Mountains, flowing through the Longmen and the Three Gorges, converging into a vast ocean. In the bright fields, the soil churns up black waves; tractors drive past, accompanied by the floating of the songs. The old boundaries are gradually disappearing from the ground; who doesn't love the endless golden color in autumn! The train speeds through culverts, through bridges, through the black night fields,迎着幸福的星光; At the station, many people get on and off the train,
  The green lights all the way bless the people heading to various positions. A great wall appears under the blue sky. Willow branches and catkins flutter in the wind on the embankment. Wind and sand and floods will gradually disappear from here, and the fields under the sun welcome the swallows of spring in pairs. Layers of timber are piled up in the newly opened log yard. The golden morning glow awakens the singing of hundreds of birds in the forest. Peach blossom water pushes countless logs - colliding, tumbling, flowing into the distance. The peaks where birds cannot fly welcome distant guests; waiting for the drilling rig to penetrate the rock and drill out sparks. We want to reveal all the secrets under the motherland's ground, let the songs of labor echo in the eternally uninhabited valleys. A thousand years or ten thousand generations cannot compare to this unforgettable moment. Everything familiar has changed. Let our song become a solemn oath - dear motherland, listen, listen to my singing! The historical road of the great motherland, is rugged and long! Through blood and smoke, through pain and death, fighting people, like arrows, fly forward, through the enemy's positions, through the fire net! On the black night of the city, I used to walk the streets, tapping lightly on the deeply hidden doors in the alleys. Gently and quickly tell the news:
  "He sacrificed himself!" That day, new comrades were also accepted into the Party. The Internationale on the execution ground will always urge us to move forward, move forward! It was that October, five years ago in October,
  "The Chinese people have stood up!" - Chairman Mao's voice solemnly resounded throughout the world. I returned from Tiananmen Square late at night, unable to sleep for a long time, songs and fireworks, forever flying in my eyes. Look, the fertile land has been returned to its original owners. The land irrigated by our blood and sweat! Grabbing a handful of soil, loose, not sandy, not sticky, rejoicing that there will be a good harvest this year. This is our factory, our own factory! I have worked here for thirty years, as if tied to a gear; but today, seeing that group of young people busy, hey, look, see who is stronger than whom! Friendship competitions are unfolding everywhere, today's motherland, has a new pattern again. The will of 600 million people, condensed into our Constitution, as strong as iron, as strong as steel; harder than iron, stronger than steel. Let those reactionaries be frightened and panic. Rise high, my song, the song of songs, the song of the motherland! In the struggle, you have made us crush numerous difficulties, and today, the power of youth is awakening in us again! Long live the motherland! In the world's situation, you show great strength, like the midday sun high in the East. Sing praises, sing praises of our Constitution! Sing praises of Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China! Glory to the Party! Glory to the people! In the new journey of the motherland, its life will be more glorious! The Constitution is our pride, the Constitution is our strength, you are the source of all glory and happiness, your light shines on us, advancing on this great land. Long live our people! Bless sisters and brothers! Bless fathers and mothers! Bless the friendship of comrades! Bless consolidated love! Bless the ever-prosperous and prosperous youth of the motherland! Bless! Bless! Bless the bright sun, drive away all the darkness, and forever shine on us, shine on us!

    颂歌——为庆祝中华人民共和国宪法而作
  　胥树人
    一太阳升起了。美丽的五星旗飘拂在阳光和灿烂的朝霞里；轻柔的薄雾消失在遥远的天际；连续不断地高唱着——金鸡。千百年来人民呼唤的祖国呵！锦绣山河，苏醒在这金色的早晨；鲜红的果实，累累地压弯了绿枝；希望和回忆，汹涌地在我心中交织。
  仿佛是不同的颜色组成的灿烂的图画，
  仿佛是不同的声音组成的和谐的交响，不同的民族组成了我们的国家。各族人民欢呼着迎接你，祖国的第一部宪法！草原上骏马飞驰，传送着这欢乐的消息；老头子，白须飘洒，骄傲地骑在马上。一切歌声欢腾起来。随着琴弦底弹响，消息搅动了草地，惊跳着成群的牛羊。过去了，战争的烟尘！轻轻的马蹄踏碎了金针花上黎明的露珠。百灵鸟从不可见的上方倾泻着美妙的欢乐的音调。鲜红的草原——沉浸在新酿的葡萄酒里。库尔河的流水呵，唱吧，唱吧！塞上的柳枝，摇晃着缕缕青烟和白云；竖井的上空，太阳偷窥着变幻的舞姿和石油河里白杨树双双的倒影一起闪动。开花的草坪上，拉鼓声震动着山林；深深的山谷里，到处响起了回声。
  “苗家下山了！”芦笙亲爱地对答着。幸福的人们，彻夜地歌舞到天明。孔雀飞翔着。火里开了白莲。新挖的水渠正把这高原浇灌。珠穆朗玛峰上写上了我们的宪法，永恒的北极星，照着它在黑夜辉闪。无数的人群，在狂烈欢呼中走来；全中国的人民，在宪法的光辉下前进。灼热的太阳照着前额上涔涔的汗珠，一致的步伐——呵听！听，听，听！二是谁叫心灵手巧的织女用云霞织成这胜利的篇章！我看见彩虹高高地横过晴空，架设起通向未来的桥梁。车间和车间之间，玫瑰花正吐着芳香。明朗的夏夜，一切都在歌唱。千百万人民，今天有了宪法；一切的齿轮和车轴，将更快乐地震响。无垠的青天上展开了祖国的蓝图。精心的设计：宏大而又周详。满天的星星撒播着欢乐的种子；幸福的心灵正在星光与星光之间飞翔。这里一切都在它应有的位置。我望着烟囱的森林。城市的上空，深夜的灯光在远方闪闪发红。我听着不停的营营声：城市的心脏在律动。就是人民，普普通通的人民亲手写下了光荣幸福的诗章。我想像着崭新的、一个完整的祖国像刚才检验合格的成品，放在我们的手上。我听见四面八方的歌声，像春水泛潮的江河，流过那昆仑山积雪的高峰，流过龙门和三峡，汇成了一片汪洋。光辉的田野，泥土翻腾着黑浪；拖拉机开过去，随着那歌声底飘扬。古老的地界正在逐渐地从地面消失；谁不爱秋天里那一望无际的金黄！列车飞驰着，穿过涵洞，穿过桥梁，穿过黑夜的原野，迎着幸福的星光；车站上多少人上车、下车，
  一路的绿灯，祝福着奔向各个岗位上的人们。蓝天下出现了万里长堤。柳丝和飞絮，在堤上迎风飘荡。风沙和洪水将渐渐从这里绝迹，阳光下的田野，欢迎着春天的燕子双双。层层的木材，堆积在新开的楞场。金色的朝霞，惊醒了森林中百鸟的歌唱。桃花水推送着无数的原木——撞击着，翻滚着，流向远方。鸟飞不到的山峰，欢迎着远道的客人；等待着钻探机透进岩石，钻出火光。我们要揭露祖国地下的一切秘密，让劳动的歌声在亘古无人的山谷中回响。千年万代抵不上这难忘的一瞬间。熟悉的一切，已经变了样。让我们的歌声变成庄严的誓词——亲爱的祖国呵，听一听，听一听我的歌唱！三伟大祖国的历史的道路呵，崎岖而又久长！通过血泊和烟尘，通过痛苦和死亡，战斗的人民箭也似地，飞驰向前，穿过敌人的阵地，穿过火网！城市的黑夜，我曾走过街头，在那弄堂里轻叩过深掩的门。轻轻地、迅速地说出那消息：
  “牺牲了！”那一天同时接受了新的同志入党。那刑场上的国际歌永远催促着我们前进，前进！是那个十月，五年前的十月，
  “中国人民站起来了！”——毛主席的声音庄严地响遍世界。我从那天安门深夜里归来，长久地不能入睡，歌声和焰火，永远在我的眼中飞腾。看吧，肥沃的田地归还了原来的主人。我们血汗灌溉的田地呵！用手捻一把土，松松的，不沙，不粘，欣喜着今年有好的收成。这儿是我们的工厂，自己的工厂呵！我在这里工作三十年，像给缚在齿轮上；但是今天，看见那一伙忙来忙去的年青人，喂，看看吧，看一看究竟谁比谁强！友谊的竞赛，展开在一切地方，今天的祖国，又有了新的图样。六万万人的意志，凝结成我们的宪法，如铁、似钢；比铁还硬，比钢还强。让那些反动派吓得胆战心慌。四高高地升起吧，我的歌，颂歌中的颂歌，祖国的颂歌呵！在斗争中你使我们粉碎了重重困难，而今天，青春底力量又在我们身上觉醒了！万岁，祖国！在世界的风云中你显示着伟大的力量，像中午的太阳高高地悬在东方。歌颂吧，歌颂我们的宪法！歌颂毛泽东和中国共产党！光荣归于党！光荣归于人民！祖国在新的里程中，它的生命将更加辉煌！宪法是我们的骄傲，宪法是我们的力量，你是一切光荣和幸福的泉源，你的光辉照耀着我们，前进在这伟大的土地上。万岁，我们人民！祝福姐妹和兄弟！祝福父亲和母亲！祝福同志的友谊！祝福巩固的爱情！祝福青春的祖国永远繁荣、昌盛！祝福吧！祝福吧！祝福光辉的太阳，赶走了一切的黑暗，永远照临着我们，照临着我们！
