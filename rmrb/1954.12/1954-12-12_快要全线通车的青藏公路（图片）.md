The Qinghai-Tibet Highway (from Xining, Qinghai to Lhasa, Tibet), which began construction in 1953, was opened to traffic up to Heihe, Tibet in November of this year. It is now being extended westward, preparing to open to traffic to Lhasa before the end of this year. It will connect with the Kangzang Highway. This will have an important role in building our frontier, strengthening national defense, and developing the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of all ethnic groups.

    快要全线通车的青藏公路
    从一九五三年开始修筑的青藏公路（青海西宁到西藏拉萨）已在今年十一月通车到西藏黑河，现正继续向西伸延，准备在今年年底以前通车到拉萨。它将和康藏公路衔接起来。这对于建设祖国边疆、巩固国防和发展各族人民政治、经济和文化事业，都有重要的作用。
