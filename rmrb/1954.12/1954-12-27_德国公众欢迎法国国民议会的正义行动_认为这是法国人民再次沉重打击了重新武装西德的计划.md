Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 25th: According to TASS, residents of the German Democratic Republic were very pleased to hear the news that the French National Assembly had rejected the first article of the bill on ratifying the Paris Agreements – the one stipulating the arming of West Germany.

According to Deutsche Presse-Agentur, staff members of the People's Representative Assembly of the Dresden District convened a meeting upon learning of the French National Assembly's vote result, and unanimously passed a telegram to the members of the French National Assembly. The telegram stated: "Your decision demonstrates the will of the French people and all peace-loving people, and also the will of the citizens of the German Democratic Republic."

Employees of the Dresden Railway Labor Office sent a telegram to the members of the Bonn Parliament, urging them to refuse to ratify the Paris Agreements in order to safeguard peace. The telegram stated: Please consider that if the Paris Agreements are ratified, reaching an agreement between East and West will not only be difficult, but impossible.

The evening newspaper "Berliner Abendblatt" in the democratic sector of Berlin commented on the outcome of the French National Assembly vote, saying: "For the second time in four months, the peace-loving forces of the French people have dealt a solid blow to the plans for reviving German militarism."

Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: Bonn dispatch: The news of the French National Assembly's rejection of the Paris Agreement protocol on arming West Germany was welcomed by the West German Social Democratic Party. A spokesperson for the Social Democratic Party pointed out: The result of the vote proves that the West must first find a common policy for restoring German unity through four-power negotiations with the Soviet Union.

However, for the Adenauer government, the vote in the French Parliament caused panic. After learning of the outcome of the French Parliament's vote on the morning of the 24th, Adenauer immediately canceled his Christmas holiday plans and rushed back to Bonn from his home in Rhöndorf to convene an emergency meeting with his advisors and senior officials. The Associated Press quoted Bonn officials as saying that Adenauer was "deeply disappointed by the surprising vote result in France."

A United Press dispatch from Bonn pointed out: The Adenauer government fears that if the French National Assembly confirms its rejection of the Paris Agreements on arming West Germany, "a major crisis will reoccur in the Western alliance," and Adenauer's "political difficulties will also increase." Therefore, West German officials hope to salvage the situation "at any cost."

According to United Press, Adenauer and Bonn figures have once again resorted to threatening to get the United States and Britain to agree to "go it alone," bypassing France and arming West Germany, and have indicated that they will force the Bonn Parliament to reject the Saar Agreement, thereby pressuring the French National Assembly to change its decision to reject the reconstruction of the West German "Bundeswehr" when it holds a vote of confidence next week.

    德国公众欢迎法国国民议会的正义行动
    认为这是法国人民再次沉重打击了重新武装西德的计划
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十四日讯：德意志民主共和国居民听到了法国国民议会否决了关于批准巴黎协定法案的第一条——规定武装西德的一条——的消息以后，感到非常高兴。
    德意志通讯社消息，德累斯顿区人民代表会议的工作人员在知道法国国民议会表决结果时召开了会议，会上一致通过了一封给法国国民议会议员的电报。电报说：“你们的决定表现了法国人民和一切爱好和平的人民的意志，也表现了德意志民主共和国公民的意志。”
    德累斯顿铁路劳动处的职员打电报给波恩议会的议员们，要求他们为了保卫和平拒绝批准巴黎协定。电报说：请你们想一想，巴黎协定如果批准，东西方要达成协议就不仅困难，而且不可能。
    柏林民主区的晚报“柏林日报晚刊”评论法国国民议会表决的结果说：“法国人民的和平力量四个月来第二次扎扎实实地打击了复活德国军国主义的计划。”
    【新华社二十五日讯】波恩消息：法国国民议会拒绝巴黎协定中关于武装西德的议定书的消息得到了西德社会民主党的欢迎。社会民主党的一个发言人指出：表决的结果证明：西方必须首先用和苏联举行四国谈判的办法来找出一种恢复德国统一的共同政策。
    但是对于阿登纳政府，法国议会的表决却引起了惊慌。阿登纳在二十四日早晨知道法国议会表决的结果后，马上取消了他的度圣诞节的计划，从他的在鲁恩多夫的家中赶回波恩，召集他的顾问和高级官员举行紧急会议。美联社引波恩官员的谈话，阿登纳“对于法国令人吃惊的表决结果深感失望”。
    合众社从波恩发出的一条消息指出：阿登纳政府担心如果法国国民议会肯定了它的拒绝武装西德的巴黎协定的表决，整个西方的“联盟中将再度发生重大的危机”，而且阿登纳“在政治上的困难也会增加”。所以，西德的官员们希望“不惜任何代价”来挽回局势。
    据合众社报道：阿登纳和波恩人士已经重新搬出要使美国和英国同意“单独干”、撇开法国而把西德武装起来的威胁，并且表示要使波恩议会否决萨尔协定，这样来压迫法国国民议会在下周举行信任投票时改变它拒绝重建西德“国防军”的决定。
