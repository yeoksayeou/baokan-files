    "Zhongxuesheng" Magazine Holds 25th Anniversary Symposium

    The "Zhongxuesheng" (Middle School Student) Magazine held a 25th anniversary symposium on the afternoon of December 12th. Among those attending the symposium were Ye Shengtao and Chen Zenggu, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, Liu Daosheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, Weng Dujian, Director of the Beijing Education Bureau, Zhong Jingwen, Professor of the Department of Literature at Beijing Normal University, scientist Gao Shiqi, poet Zang Kejia, and children's literature writer Chen Bochui, totaling more than fifty people. Ye Shengtao, Vice Minister of Education and former editor of "Zhongxuesheng," stated in his speech that today, "Zhongxuesheng" has a circulation of over 240,000 copies, exceeding the peak circulation of "Zhongxuesheng" in the past (before liberation) by eight times, and its future prospects are even brighter. He expressed the hope that "Zhongxuesheng" will pay attention to being profound yet simple in content, combining it with the actual lives of its readers, and strive for popularization and artistry in form, to meet the requirements of the broad readership. Weng Dujian, Director of the Beijing Education Bureau, said in his speech that "Zhongxuesheng" is a necessary extracurricular reading material for junior middle school students, which can help students expand their knowledge domain and consolidate their regular curriculum learning. Middle school teachers have a responsibility to care for and support "Zhongxuesheng." Today, there are a large number of junior middle school and higher primary school graduates who have not been able to continue their education and need to continue to improve their cultural and scientific knowledge, and "Zhongxuesheng" should also appropriately meet their needs. Scientist Gao Shiqi suggested that "Zhongxuesheng" should publish more popular science works to cultivate young people's love for science. Experts and teachers from various fields also spoke at the meeting, offering many specific suggestions for the future editorial work of "Zhongxuesheng." Finally, Liu Daosheng, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Youth League, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Youth League and the China Youth Publishing House, expressed his gratitude to the guests present and explained that the Central Committee of the Youth League has decided that, starting next year, in addition to targeting junior middle school students as its main audience, "Zhongxuesheng" must also take into account the vast number of junior middle school and higher primary school graduates who have not been able to continue their education, in order to meet the needs of junior middle school students and junior middle school and higher primary school graduates to learn various cultural and scientific knowledge.

    “中学生”杂志社
    举行二十五周年纪念座谈会
    “中学生”杂志社在十二日下午举行二十五周年纪念座谈会。出席座谈会的有中华人民共和国教育部副部长叶圣陶、陈曾固，中国新民主主义青年团中央书记处书记刘导生，北京市教育局局长翁独健，北京师范大学文学系教授锺敬文，科学家高士其，诗人臧克家，儿童文学家陈伯吹等五十多人。教育部副部长、前“中学生”的编者叶圣陶在会上发言说，今天“中学生”发行二十四万份以上，已经超过过去（解放前）全盛时期“中学生”发行数量的八倍，将来前途更是远大；希望“中学生”今后在内容上注意深入浅出，结合读者的实际生活，在形式上力求通俗化、文艺化，以适合广大读者的要求。北京市教育局局长翁独健在发言中说，“中学生”是初中学生必要的课外读物，能帮助学生扩大知识领域，巩固正课学习；中学的教师们有责任关心、支持“中学生”；今天有广大未能升学的初中、高小毕业生，都需要继续提高文化科学知识，
  “中学生”也应该适当地满足他们的要求。科学家高士其建议“中学生”要多多刊登通俗科学作品，培养青少年对科学的热爱。在会上发言的还有各方面的专家和教师们，他们对“中学生”今后的编辑工作提出不少具体的建议。最后团中央书记处书记刘导生代表团中央及中国青年出版社对出席的来宾表示了感谢，并说明团中央已决定，从明年起，“中学生”除了以初中学生为主要对象外，并须兼顾广大的未能升学的初中、高小毕业生，以满足初中学生及初中、高小毕业生学习各种文化科学知识的要求。
