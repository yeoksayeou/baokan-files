On December 8, at the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, Soviet Representative Malik stated during the discussion of the Korean question that the countries participating in the intervention in the Korean War were not interested in a swift resolution of the Korean question according to peaceful, democratic principles.

The delegations of these countries, mainly the United States delegation, attempted to obstruct the adoption of the Soviet proposal to convene a conference of all relevant countries to discuss the Korean question. They attempted to distort the attitudes of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet delegation on the Korean question, and disregarded the opinions and suggestions of other relevant countries, attempting to have the General Assembly accept their opinions and conditions for resolving this issue.

Malik continued that the countries participating in the intervention in Korea rejected the proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China on this issue, but they did not put forward any constructive suggestions aimed at a swift resolution of the Korean question. Judging from the speeches of their representatives, they also rejected the Soviet proposal to convene a conference of all relevant countries in the near future to discuss the Korean question. Moreover, the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom openly declared that no practical steps should be taken at present to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and even insisted that the time was not yet ripe to continue Korean negotiations.

These statements strongly prove that the United States and those countries that support it on the Korean question are unwilling to take practical steps to resolve this issue.

They attempt to explain that the Korean question can only be resolved peacefully "under the protection of the United Nations," and that there is no other way to achieve this. However, as has already been pointed out, the United Nations Charter not only permits but encourages the peaceful resolution of such issues through negotiations between the relevant countries. Article 33 of the Charter clearly states that "The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which endangers the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation..." Therefore, the Soviet delegation's proposal to convene a meeting of relevant countries to resolve the Korean question is fully in line with the Charter and principles of the United Nations.

Some representatives said that the peaceful resolution of the Korean question by relevant countries outside the framework of the United Nations might damage the prestige of the United Nations. It is clear that this argument is obviously fabricated and cannot be justified. The fact is quite the opposite. If the General Assembly passes a resolution to convene a conference of relevant countries to discuss the Korean question, and if such a conference is convened, it will undoubtedly contribute to further easing international tensions, thereby greatly enhancing the authority and prestige of the United Nations. In this regard, one cannot but agree with the opinion of Swedish representative Mr. Solman. He said here when talking about the Korean question, "If such a task is handed over to an agency outside the United Nations, it will not affect the prestige of the United Nations."

The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea fully support the principle of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korea. Indeed, the Soviet Union has always advocated, and still advocates, the establishment of a unified, independent, and democratic Korea by peaceful means.

The Soviet Union has always advocated, and still advocates, the complete restoration of international peace and security in the region. The necessity of holding free elections in Korea is also related to this principle. We have always advocated, and still advocate, holding free elections in Korea.

Free elections throughout Korea are the key to the proposals put forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Geneva Conference. These proposals were strongly supported by the Soviet delegation and the delegation of the People's Republic of China. These proposals not only proclaimed the principle of free elections, but also stipulated specific and practical steps to ensure genuine freedom during the preparation and holding of elections.

These proposals stipulated that a draft pan-Korean election law should be drawn up by a pan-Korean committee to ensure truly democratic elections held in a free environment, excluding foreign interference and pressure from local authorities and terrorist groups on voters. These proposals also stipulated guaranteeing the freedom of assembly and publication for the Korean people and the freedom for all Korean citizens to nominate candidates for the legislature, regardless of their political beliefs, religious beliefs, gender, and ethnicity.

The proposal to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea before the elections is very important for creating a free atmosphere during the elections.

The representatives of the countries that participated in the Korean War on the side of the United States had completely different views on the election issue. As has been pointed out, the proposals put forward by the South Korean delegation actually amounted to a rejection of the idea of holding free elections throughout Korea. The essence of these proposals can be summarized as follows: first, the elections must first comply with the anti-democratic election laws and rules of the South Korean Syngman Rhee regime; second, the elections must be held in South Korea under the occupation of foreign troops.

It is quite obvious what direction the United States and the countries that support it are working towards. They are trying to impose the South Korean Syngman Rhee regime on the whole of Korea, and for this purpose, they advocate holding elections of the kind that are usually held in South Korea under military and police terror and foreign occupation – albeit ostensibly under "United Nations supervision."

The delegations of the United States, the United Kingdom, and some other countries have made considerable efforts to try to portray the problem as if the proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union did not guarantee fair international supervision of free elections in Korea.

The US representative even said that Mr. Nam Il, the head of the North Korean delegation attending the Geneva Conference, had openly suggested that the idea of holding elections under fair supervision should be abandoned. This statement can only be regarded as a deliberate distortion of the attitude of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Geneva Conference, in order to justify the US delegation's obstruction of negotiations on the Korean issue at the Geneva Conference. In fact, in his speech on June 5, 1954, Nam Il insisted that supervision of the elections should be carried out by a truly impartial international body. Nam Il said that this body could be composed of representatives of countries that had not participated in the intervention in Korea.

It is not difficult to see that supervision of the elections by one of the belligerent parties cannot guarantee fairness or ensure that such supervision is effective, no matter how hard the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom try to come to the opposite conclusion.

The United Nations' discussion of the Korean issue for many years shows that the delegations of the countries that participated in the intervention in the Korean War have never taken a fair and objective attitude towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. Therefore, it would be too naive to expect them to show such fairness when supervising Korean elections.

Incidentally, everyone knows that these countries that participated in the intervention in the Korean War, with the support of some other countries that are in collusion with them through military and political alliances and agreements, have gained a controlling position in the United Nations by relying on the votes they have put together.

It is these countries that have exerted pressure on the United Nations organization during the Korean War, and are still exerting pressure, resulting in the United Nations organization taking a one-sided and unfair stance and proving its inability to resolve the Korean issue.

It is enough to point out that the United Nations, in the process of discussing the Korean issue, has neither listened to the opinions of the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea nor listened to the opinions of the representative of the People's Republic of China.

However, it is clear that only an organization that is trusted and respected by all relevant countries can conduct fair international supervision of Korean elections.

Malik continued that it can be seen from the speeches of the representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom on the issue of election supervision that their attitude towards this issue is determined by the following desire: to obstruct the establishment of truly fair international supervision of elections throughout Korea, and to force the implementation of a supervision system that would allow the United States and the Syngman Rhee regime to rely on their majority in the United Nations to force the people of the whole of Korea to accept their will and conditions.

Therefore, the proposal to withdraw foreign troops from Korea and the proposal to hold truly free pan-Korean elections under truly fair international supervision have been stubbornly rejected.

The British representative also talked about the German election issue in his speech. He said that in Geneva, the communist delegations, based on their proposals on pan-German elections put forward in Berlin, suggested forming a pan-Korean committee to hold elections.

The Soviet delegation considers it necessary to declare in this regard that the Soviet Union hopes that both the German elections and the Korean elections are truly free and democratic. Our starting point is that such elections in Germany should be held by the Germans themselves, and in Korea should be held by the Koreans themselves, and not by foreign occupying authorities, as some Western countries insist.

Malik pointed out that the discussion on the Korean issue shows that in Korea, what some Western countries call "free elections" means letting the United States freely turn Korea into a military bridgehead and turn Koreans into cannon fodder.

In Korea, in Germany, there are people who are trying to use military agreements to enable foreign troops to be permanently stationed there—in Germany until 1998, that is, until the end of the 20th century, and in Korea, according to the provisions of the military agreement imposed by the United States on South Korea, it will exist "indefinitely".

The main reason why these Western countries refuse the proposal to withdraw foreign troops from Korea lies in this.

When summarizing the results of the discussion on the Korean issue, it is necessary to point out that it is only possible to resolve this issue through negotiations with the broad participation of all relevant countries, on an equal footing, and without any preconditions.

Starting from this point, the Soviet delegation proposed to convene a meeting of relevant countries in the near future to discuss the Korean issue.

Some people insist that the "time is not yet ripe" to convene such a meeting, and we have no reason to agree with these people. The Korean issue is a source of serious threat to the cause of peace in the Far East, and therefore, the resolution of the Korean issue brook no delay. Although the Geneva Conference did not reach an agreement, it did a lot of very important work, and if this work continues, it can lead to a resolution of the Korean issue.

The Geneva Conference has helped to achieve a common understanding on some issues. The participants in the conference all advocated holding free elections to elect a national assembly for a unified, independent, and democratic Korea. The Soviet delegation suggested in Geneva that this election could be held within six months after the signing of the agreement. Everyone agreed that the election should be universal, should be conducted by secret ballot, and should well abide by the principle of proportional representation of the pan-Korean legislature. The participants in the conference also recognized the need for fair international supervision of the elections.

The Soviet delegation suggested at the time that a principled agreement be reached on the issue of establishing an appropriate international committee for this purpose, so that the composition of such a supervisory committee could be further discussed. If the US delegation had not hastily taken steps to interrupt the Geneva negotiations at that time, it is undoubtedly possible that an agreement could have been reached on this issue.

It is worth pointing out that even here, in the General Assembly, although the US delegation tried to prevent the resumption of negotiations between the relevant countries on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, many delegations expressed their willingness to seek ways to reach an agreement on the Korean issue.

The Soviet delegation's proposal is fully in line with these tasks. There is no doubt that convening a conference of relevant countries will promote the speedy resolution of the long-standing and pressing issue of restoring the reunification of the Korean people.

### 十二月八日在联合国大会政治委员会上  苏联代表马立克关于朝鲜问题的演说（摘要）

    十二月八日在联合国大会政治委员会上
    苏联代表马立克关于朝鲜问题的演说（摘要）
    苏联代表马立克在联合国大会政治委员会十二月八日讨论朝鲜问题时发言说，政治委员会关于朝鲜问题的讨论说明了参加干涉朝鲜战争的国家对于按照和平、民主方针迅速解决朝鲜问题不感兴趣。
    这些国家的代表团，主要是美国代表团，力图阻挠通过苏联提出的召开由所有有关国家参加的会议来讨论朝鲜问题的提案。它们企图歪曲朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国以及苏联代表团在朝鲜问题上的态度，并且不顾其他有关国家的意见和建议，力图使大会接受它们的意见和它们解决这个问题的条件。
    马立克继续说，参加干涉朝鲜的国家拒绝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、苏联和中华人民共和国就这个问题提出的建议，但它们却没有提出任何目的在于迅速解决朝鲜问题的建设性建议。从它们的代表的发言来看，它们也拒绝苏联提出的关于在最近的将来召开由所有有关国家参加的会议来讨论朝鲜问题的建议。不仅如此，美国和英国代表还公然宣布在目前不应该采取任何实际步骤来谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，而且硬说继续举行朝鲜谈判的时候还没有到来。
    这些言论有力地证明美国和那些在朝鲜问题上支持它的国家不愿采取实际的步骤来解决这个问题。
    他们企图说明，只有“在联合国保护之下”，才能够用和平的办法来解决朝鲜问题，除此以外，就没有别的办法能够做到这一点了。不过，正如已经指出的，联合国宪章不仅准许，而且鼓励通过有关国家的谈判来和平解决这样的问题。宪章第三十三条明白地说，“任何争端之当事国，于争端之继续存在足以危及国际和平与安全之维持时，应尽先以谈判……求得解决。”因此，苏联代表团提出的召集有关国家举行会议来解决朝鲜问题的建议完全是符合联合国的宪章和原则的。
    有些代表说，有关国家在联合国范围外和平解决朝鲜问题，可能损害联合国的威信。很明白，这种论点显然是制造出来的，而且是不能自圆其说的。事实恰恰相反，如果大会通过决议来召集有关国家讨论朝鲜问题的会议，以及召开这样的会议，那对进一步缓和国际紧张局势、从而大大提高联合国的权威和威信无疑地会有贡献。在这一方面，人们不能不同意瑞典代表索尔曼先生的意见。他在这里谈到朝鲜问题时说，“如果把这样一个任务交给联合国以外的某一机构，那并不会影响联合国的威信。”
    关于建立一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜的原则的声明，苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是完全支持这一原则的。的确，苏联过去一贯主张，到现在仍然主张用和平方法建立一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜。
    苏联一贯主张，到现在仍然主张完全恢复这个地区的国际和平和安全。在朝鲜举行自由选举的必要性也是和这个原则联系着的。我们过去主张，到现在仍然主张在朝鲜举行自由选举。
    全朝鲜的自由选举是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在日内瓦会议上提出的建议的关键。这些建议得到苏联代表团和中华人民共和国代表团的大力支持。这些建议不仅宣布了自由选举的原则，而且规定了在准备和举行选举的期间保证真正自由的具体切实的步骤。
    这些建议规定由全朝鲜委员会拟订一个全朝鲜选举法草案，保证在自由环境下举行真正民主的选举，排除外国的干涉和地方当局以及恐怖集团对选民的压力。这些建议还规定了保证朝鲜人民的集社出版自由和全体朝鲜公民提出立法机构候选人的自由，不管他们的政治信仰、宗教信仰、性别和民族怎样。
    在举行选举之前从朝鲜境内撤出一切外国军队的建议，对于在选举期间创造一种自由空气非常重要。
    站在美国一方参加朝鲜战争的国家的代表团在选举问题上的主张完全不同。正如已经指出的那样，通过南朝鲜代表团提出来的建议实际上是拒绝举行全朝鲜自由选举的主张。这些建议的实质归纳起来主要是：选举首先要遵守南朝鲜李承晚政权的反民主选举法和规则，其次是要在南朝鲜被外国军队占领的情况下举行。
    十分明显，美国和支持它的国家是朝着什么方向努力的。它们正在设法把南朝鲜李承晚政权强加于整个朝鲜，并且为了这个目的，主张举行南朝鲜通常举行的那种在军事和警察恐怖和外国占领的情况下——虽然外表上是在“联合国的监督下”——举行的选举。
    美国、英国和其他一些国家的代表团曾经作了不小的努力，企图把问题说成是好像朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联的建议并没有保证对朝鲜自由选举进行公正的国际监督。
    美国代表居然说，参加日内瓦会议的北朝鲜代表团团长南日先生曾经公开建议应该放弃在公正的监督下举行选举的主张。这种说法只能被认为是蓄意歪曲朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团在日内瓦会议上的态度，以便为美国代表团在日内瓦会议上阻挠关于朝鲜问题的谈判的行径辩解。实际上，南日在一九五四年六月五日的发言中坚持对选举的监督应该由一个真正公正的国际机构来执行。南日说，这个机构可以由没有参加干涉朝鲜的国家的代表组成。
    不难看出，由交战一方对选举进行监督是既不能保证公正、而且也不能保证这种监督是有效的，不论美国和英国的代表如何拚命设法想得出相反的结论。
    联合国许多年来关于朝鲜问题的讨论表明：参加干涉朝鲜战争的国家的代表团从来没有对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国采取过公正的和客观的态度，因此，如果指望他们监督朝鲜选举时会表现出这种公正态度，那就太天真了。
    附带提一下，大家知道，这些参加干涉朝鲜战争的国家在其他一些因军事和政治联盟及协定同它们串通一气的国家的支持下，靠它们所拼凑的票数在联合国中取得了控制地位。
    正是这些国家在朝鲜战争期间曾经对联合国组织施加压力，而且目前还在施加压力，结果使联合国组织采取了一种片面的、不公正的立场，并且证明它没有能力来解决朝鲜问题。
    只要指出这一点就够了：联合国在讨论朝鲜问题的过程中，既没有听取朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的意见，也没有听取中华人民共和国代表的意见。
    但是，很明显，只有得到一切有关国家的信任和尊重的机构，才可以对朝鲜选举进行公正的国际监督。
    马立克接着说，从美国和英国的代表在选举的监督问题上的发言中可以看出，他们对这个问题的态度是由下面这种愿望来决定的，阻挠对全朝鲜的选举建立真正公正的国际监督，强迫实行一种将使美国和李承晚政权可以依靠它们在联合国中的多数强使全朝鲜人民接受他们的意志和条件的监督制度。
    因此，关于从朝鲜撤退外国军队的建议以及关于在真正公正的国际监督下举行真正自由的全朝鲜选举的建议，就遭到了顽固的拒绝。
    英国代表在他的发言中还谈到德国选举问题，他说，在日内瓦，共产党代表团以它们在柏林提出的关于全德选举的建议为蓝本，建议成立全朝鲜委员会来举行选举。
    苏联代表团认为有必要在这方面宣布，苏联希望德国选举和朝鲜选举都是真正自由和民主的。我们的出发点是：这种选举在德国应该由德国人自己来举行，在朝鲜应该由朝鲜人自己来举行，而不是像某些西方国家所坚持的那样，由外国占领当局来举行。
    马立克指出，关于朝鲜问题的讨论说明，在朝鲜，某些西方国家所说的“自由选举”，意思就是让美国畅所欲为地把朝鲜变成军事桥头堡，把朝鲜人变成炮灰。
    在朝鲜，在德国，正有人试图用军事协定的办法使外国军队能永久驻扎在那里——在德国是维持到一九九八年，也就是说到二十世纪末了，在朝鲜，依照美国强加在南朝鲜头上的军事协定的规定，是
  “无限期”存在下去。
    这些西方国家拒绝自朝鲜撤退外国军队的建议，主要原因就在于此。
    总结朝鲜问题讨论的结果时有必要指出，只有在所有有关国家的广泛参加下，在平等的基础上以及在没有任何先决条件的情况下进行谈判，才有可能解决这个问题。
    从这一点出发，苏联代表团建议在最近的将来召集有关国家举行会议来讨论朝鲜问题。
    有些人硬说，召集这样一个会议的“时间还不成熟”，我们没有理由同意这些人的说法。朝鲜问题是对远东和平事业的严重威胁的源泉，因此，朝鲜问题的解决是不容拖延的。日内瓦会议虽然没有达成协议，但却做了很多很重要的工作，这种工作如果继续做下去，就能导致朝鲜问题的解决。
    日内瓦会议已帮助在某些问题上取得了共同的看法。会议的参加者都主张举行自由选举，来选举一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜的国民议会。苏联代表团在日内瓦建议，这个选举可以在协议签字后六个月内举行。大家都同意，选举应该是普遍的，应该采取不记名投票方式，并且应该很好地遵守全朝鲜立法机构的比例代表制原则。会议的参加者也都承认了对选举进行公正的国际监督的必要性。
    苏联代表团当时建议在为此目的而建立适当的国际委员会问题上取得原则性协议，以便可以进一步讨论这样一个监督委员会的组成问题。如果当时美国代表团不仓促采取步骤中断日内瓦谈判的话，无疑地，在这个问题上达成协议是有可能的。
    值得指出的是，甚至在这里，在大会上，尽管美国代表团力图阻止恢复有关国家讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的谈判，也有不少代表团表示愿意寻求在朝鲜问题上达成协议的途径。
    苏联代表团的建议是完全符合这些任务的。毫无疑问，召集有关国家的会议会促进恢复朝鲜人民的统一这个长期存在的迫切问题的尽速解决。
