Along with the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government's promulgation of the "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises" on July 14th, the relevant enterprise departments under the Central People's Government were instructed to formulate internal labor regulations suitable for the working conditions of their respective departments based on this outline. Factory directors or managers of each enterprise unit should also formulate internal labor regulations for their enterprise unit based on the provisions of the outline and the internal labor regulations of their department, combined with the specific circumstances of the enterprise unit. Only by specifying the "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises" into the labor regulations of each enterprise, will it become an internal labor regulation that directly guides the labor activities of employees, and can it better play its role in maintaining labor discipline.

Now, more than four months have passed since the "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises" was promulgated. Most of the central enterprise departments have begun the work of formulating internal labor regulations, and some enterprise units have also organized employees to study and draft internal labor regulations. However, on the whole, this work has not been well developed. Some departments have not actively and earnestly led this work, and the situation is even more prevalent in state-owned enterprises that have not carried out this work. Even in departments or enterprises that have drafted internal labor regulations, there are still many problems.

The reason why the work of formulating internal labor regulations for departments and enterprises based on the "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises" has not been better developed is mainly because the leaders of some departments and enterprises have not paid enough attention to this work. They should quickly change this abnormal situation and put this work on an important agenda.

Some leading cadres in enterprise departments and enterprises believe that the requirements of the "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises" are too high and the regulations are too strict. They think that the current working level of our enterprises is still low, and the masses are not accustomed to it, so they are afraid that the masses will not accept it. As a result, they are hesitant and dare not resolutely implement the "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises". This understanding is obviously wrong. It is not only urgently needed but also fully possible for state-owned enterprises to formulate internal labor regulations now. State-owned enterprises have accumulated some experience in labor organization work in recent years, which is the basis for formulating labor regulations. As for saying that the labor regulations are too strict and the masses may not accept them, this is actually an underestimation of the consciousness of the masses. The majority of employees in state-owned enterprises have increasingly realized the importance of labor discipline in ensuring production through the continuous education of the Party and the practice of labor in recent years. Further consolidating labor discipline and correcting the phenomena that undermine discipline are precisely their common demands. The "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises" is formulated based on this common aspiration of the broad masses of employees and concentrates their actual labor experience. All the provisions of the outline are things that the enterprise administration and all employees should do and can do to ensure normal work. In fact, most of these regulations have been fulfilled by the majority of employees in the past. Only a small number of employees still have disciplinary violations such as absenteeism, evasion of labor, passive slowdown, disobedience to command and dispatch, and failure to implement operating procedures and safety regulations. It is greatly beneficial to the country and the employees to strictly require these few individuals to honestly abide by discipline and work honestly, and it will inevitably be supported by the broad masses of employees. If we indulge a small number of backward employees and dare not resolutely carry out the work of implementing the "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises," the result will inevitably be detachment from the broad masses of employees, which will bring serious losses to the work of the enterprise. Even those few backward employees will think that this approach is wrong once they become aware of it.

To concretize the "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises" into the labor regulations of the department or enterprise is a very complicated and meticulous task. It must not only correctly reflect the spirit stipulated in the outline, but also fully reflect the characteristics of the department and enterprise in the regulations to adapt to the situation and needs of the department and enterprise. Therefore, to formulate the labor regulations of departments and enterprises, a series of organizational work needs to be carried out in the middle. It is not possible to simply adopt the method of a few people locking themselves in a room and building a car behind closed doors. Instead, it is necessary to first go deep into the grassroots to understand the situation, listen to opinions, and summarize experiences, and fully concentrate the opinions and requirements of all parties. The process of formulating labor regulations should become an in-depth study and summary of the labor discipline work of the department, so that the labor regulations of the department and enterprise actually become a summary of the labor discipline work of the department and enterprise. In order to formulate good labor regulations, the Central Ministry of Light Industry organized three working groups to go deep into enterprises in Shenyang, Tianjin, and other places to deeply understand and help enterprises summarize labor discipline issues. Before formulating labor regulations, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry also first sent cadres to the Shijingshan Power Plant and Jingxi Coal Mine to "get to the bottom" of the situation. This approach is better.

The internal labor regulations of an enterprise are related to the vital interests of every employee. The masses must be widely mobilized and organized to participate in the formulation, and their conscious execution and mutual supervision must be relied upon to achieve the greatest effectiveness of the labor regulations. After the promulgation of the "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises," the Huainan Coal Mine Well Construction Company organized all employees to study for 40 days, comprehensively and deeply examined various problems in labor discipline, launched mass criticism and self-criticism, commended employees who had consistently abided by labor discipline, and also punished some individuals who had consistently and seriously violated discipline. After such education, the consciousness of the employees was further improved, the phenomenon of violating labor discipline was greatly reduced, and on this basis, a draft of the company's internal labor regulations was formulated. The Shenyang Smelter held a meeting of all employee representatives to review and summarize the labor discipline of the enterprise and discussed the draft of the enterprise's internal labor regulations, which also achieved good results. The approach of Huainan Coal Mine Well Construction Company and Shenyang Smelter is better. All enterprises should also carry out publicity and education work, organize cadres and all employees to study the "Outline of Internal Labor Regulations for State-Owned Enterprises," and review the past situation of abiding by labor discipline, further improving the consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the employees, so that the basic spirit and content of the enterprise's internal labor regulations are understood by every employee. This is the key to the correct formulation and future implementation of internal labor regulations.

Some enterprises have relaxed all daily work to consolidate internal labor discipline after formulating internal labor regulations. They think that since there are labor regulations, they only need to act according to the regulations in the future. Some even simply think that whoever violates the labor regulations should be punished according to the regulations, and everything will be fine. This idea is completely wrong. The fundamental method of consolidating labor discipline is persuasion and education, which is an unshakable principle. Even if it is necessary to impose punishment, it is for the purpose of educating all employees and educating the punished person himself. Only on the basis of constantly improving the consciousness of the employees can the internal labor regulations be smoothly implemented, and labor discipline can be truly consolidated. Relying on administrative punishment to maintain labor discipline is not sustainable. Therefore, consolidating labor discipline is a long-term communist education. The completion of the formulation of enterprise internal labor regulations does not mean the end of the work, but means the beginning of new work. Labor regulations themselves will not work spontaneously. They need to be realized through our many daily tasks. We must not only not end the daily work of consolidating labor discipline, but should more systematically and persistently strengthen this work, establish special working bodies, regularly and deeply check the implementation of labor regulations, vigorously strengthen political and ideological work, enrich and improve the life of trade union groups, invigorate criticism and self-criticism, and launch labor competitions, so as to put the work of consolidating labor discipline on a regular track.

### 认真执行“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”

    认真执行“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”
    中央人民政府政务院七月十四日颁布“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”的同时，曾责成中央人民政府各企业主管部门要根据这个纲要，制订适合于本部门工作条件的内部劳动规则；各企业单位的厂长或经理，也要根据纲要和本部门内部劳动规则的规定，结合本企业单位的具体情况，拟订本企业单位的内部劳动规则。只有把“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”具体化为每一个企业的劳动规则，它才会成为直接指导职工劳动活动的内部劳动规则，也才能更好地发挥维护劳动纪律的作用。
    现在，“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”已经颁布了四个多月了，中央各企业主管部门大部分都已开始了制订内部劳动规则的工作，有些企业单位也组织职工进行了学习，拟订了内部劳动规则草案。但是总的来说，这个工作还没有很好的展开。有些部门还没有积极地认真地来领导这项工作，各地国营企业中未进行这一工作的就更普遍。在已经制订了内部劳动规则草案的部门或企业中，也还存在着不少问题。
    根据“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”制订部门内部劳动规则和企业内部劳动规则的工作之所以没有更好展开，主要是若干部门和企业的负责人对这件工作没有足够的重视，他们应该迅速改变这种不正常的状况，把这件工作摆到重要的日程上来。
    有些企业主管部门和企业中的领导干部认为：“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”的要求太高，规定太严，我们现有企业的工作水平还低，群众还不习惯，实行起来怕群众接受不了。于是他们便缩手缩脚，不敢坚决贯彻“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”。这种认识显然是不对的。国营企业现在来制订内部劳动规则，不仅有迫切的需要，也有充分的可能。几年来国营企业在劳动组织工作上已积累了一些经验，这就是制订劳动规则的基础。至于说劳动规则规定太严，怕群众接受不了，这实际上是过低地估计了群众的觉悟程度。国营企业的大多数职工，几年来在党的不断教育和劳动的实践中，已日益认识到劳动纪律对于保证生产的重要性，进一步巩固劳动纪律，纠正败坏纪律的现象，正是他们的共同要求。“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”正是根据广大职工的这种共同愿望，并集中了他们的实际劳动经验而制订的，纲要的所有规定，都是企业行政上和全体职工为了保证正常工作所应当做到和完全可以做到的事情。事实上，这些规定过去大多数职工都是已经做到了的，只有一小部分职工中仍然存在着旷工、逃避劳动、消极怠工、不服从指挥调度、不执行操作规程和保安规程等违反纪律的行为。对于这些少数分子，严格要求他们老老实实地遵守纪律，诚实劳动，这对国家对职工都是大有好处的，也必然是广大职工所拥护的。假如我们迁就少数落后职工，不敢坚决地进行贯彻“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”的工作，结果必然脱离广大职工群众，给企业的工作带来严重损失。甚至那些少数落后的职工，在一旦觉悟之后，他们也会认为这种做法是错误的。
    把“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”具体化为本部门或本企业的劳动规则，这是一件很复杂很细致的工作。它既要正确地体现出纲要中所规定的精神，又必须把本部门和企业的特点充分地反映到规则中去，以适应本部门和本企业的情况和需要。所以，制订部门和企业的劳动规则，这中间需要进行一系列的组织工作。不能单纯采取由少数人关在屋子里闭门造车的办法，而必须首先深入基层去了解情况，倾听意见，总结经验，把各方面的意见和要求充分地集中起来，把制订劳动规则的过程，成为深入地研究和总结本部门劳动纪律工作的过程，使本部门和本企业的劳动规则，实际上成为本部门本企业劳动纪律工作的一个总结。这次中央轻工业部为了制订好劳动规则，组织了三个工作小组深入到沈阳、天津等地的企业中去，深入了解和帮助企业总结劳动纪律问题。中央燃料工业部在制订劳动规则前，也首先派干部深入到石景山发电厂和京西煤矿去“摸底”。这种做法是比较好的。
    企业内部劳动规则关系着每个职工的切身利益，制订时必须广泛地发动和组织群众来参加，并要依靠他们的自觉执行和相互监督来实现，劳动规则才能发挥最大的效能。淮南煤矿建井公司在“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”颁布后，组织全体职工进行了四十天的学习，普遍深入地检查了劳动纪律中的各种问题，展开了群众性的批评和自我批评，表扬了一贯遵守劳动纪律的职工，也处分了一些一贯严重破坏纪律的分子。经过这样的教育以后，职工群众的觉悟程度进一步提高，违反劳动纪律的现象大大减少，并在这个基础上拟订了公司内部的劳动规则草案。沈阳冶炼厂曾召开全厂职工代表会议，检查和总结了本企业的劳动纪律，讨论了企业内部劳动规则草案，也收到了良好的效果。淮南煤矿建井公司和沈阳冶炼厂的这种做法是比较好的。各企业也应当很好的展开宣传教育工作，组织干部和全体职工学习“国营企业内部劳动规则纲要”，并联系检查过去遵守劳动纪律的情况，进一步提高职工群众的觉悟程度和劳动积极性，使企业内部劳动规则的基本精神和内容，为每一个职工所懂得，这是正确制订和今后贯彻内部劳动规则的关键。
    有些企业在制订了内部劳动规则以后，对巩固内部劳动纪律的一切日常工作都放松了。他们以为既然有了劳动规则，今后只要照章办事就行了。甚至简单地认为谁违反了劳动规则，照章给予处分就万事大吉了。这种想法是完全错误的。巩固劳动纪律的根本方法是说服教育，这是不可动摇的原则。即使必要进行处分，也是为了教育全体职工并教育受处分者本人。只有在不断地提高职工觉悟程度的基础上，内部劳动规则才能顺利地贯彻，劳动纪律才能真正得到巩固，依靠行政处分来维持劳动纪律那是不能持久的。因此，巩固劳动纪律是长期的共产主义教育，企业内部劳动规则的制订完成并不意味着工作的结束，而是意味着新的工作的开始。劳动规则本身不会自发地起作用，它须要通过我们的许多日常工作来实现，我们不仅不能结束巩固劳动纪律的日常工作，而是应该更有计划地、更持久地加强这方面的工作，建立专责的工作机构，随时深入地检查劳动规则的执行情况，大力地加强政治思想工作，充实和健全工会小组的生活，活跃批评和自我批评，开展劳动竞赛，把巩固劳动纪律的工作纳入经常化的轨道。
