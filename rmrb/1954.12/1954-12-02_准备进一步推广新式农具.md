    Hubei Province has achieved great success in promoting new-style walking plows and double-wheeled double-shared plows this year. It is now training technical cadres and formulating plans for further promotion this winter and next spring.
    The promotion of new-style farm tools this year was carried out on the basis of past successful experiments. According to the results of comparative tests on four crops in various parts of the province using twelve new-style walking plows and old plows, new-style walking plows increased production by an average of 20.87% compared to old plows. In wheat planting experiments, double-wheeled double-shared plows increased production by 37.37% compared to old plows, increased cultivation efficiency by 267.18% compared to old plows, and reduced the need for one worker. This year, more than 200 pieces of new-style animal-powered farm tools were used for cultivation in state-owned farms throughout the province, and typical demonstrations were conducted for the surrounding masses. In addition, 16,363 seven-inch and eight-inch walking plows and 500 double-shared plows were promoted to mutual aid and cooperation organizations and farmers.
    The agricultural departments of Hubei Province are now actively preparing for further promotion of new-style farm tools this winter and next spring. It is planned to promote another 30,000 new-style walking plows and 4,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows this winter and next spring. To ensure that new-style farm tools go where the technology goes, a large number of technical cadres are currently being trained. According to statistics from six special districts and sixty-nine counties, 112 full-time technical cadres have been assigned, 74 technical workers have been trained, and 1,879 peasant technical assistants have been cultivated. Many counties have also established new-style farm tool promotion committees to oversee the promotion of new-style farm tools. (Our Hubei Reporter Station)

    准备进一步推广新式农具
    湖北省今年推广新式步?和双轮双铧?很有成绩，现在正训练技术干部，制定今冬明春进一步推广的计划。
    今年新式农具推广工作是在过去试验取得成绩的基础上进行的。根据全省各地四种农作物用十二部新式步?和旧?对比试验的结果；新式步?比旧?平均增产百分之二十·八七。双轮双铧?在种小麦的试验中，比旧?增产百分之三七·三七，耕作效率比旧?提高百分之二百六十七·一八，并减少一个人工。今年在全省各国营农场以二百余件新式畜力农具进行耕作，同时向周围群众进行典型示范。并向互助合作组织和农民推广了七吋和八吋步?一万六千三百六十三部，双铧?五百部。
    湖北省农业部门现在已积极进行今冬明春进一步推广新式农具的准备工作。计划在今冬明春再推广新式步?三万部、双轮双铧?四千部。为了保证新式农具到那里，技术跟到那里，目前正训练大批技术干部。据六个专署、六十九个县的统计，已配备了专职技术干部一百十二人，训练了技术工人七十四人，同时培养了农民技术助手一千八百七十九人。许多县还成立了新式农具推广委员会，主持新式农具的推广工作。　（本报湖北记者站）
