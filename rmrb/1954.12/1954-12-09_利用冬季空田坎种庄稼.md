    Utilizing Empty Winter Field Ridges to Plant Crops
    In previous years, in Junping Township, Chongning County, Sichuan Province, one-third of the field ridges were left uncultivated during the winter, waiting until the next spring to plant soybeans. This year, the township Party branch, while leading the minor autumn production, mobilized the entire township's farmers to eliminate empty winter field ridges and increase grain production for the country. In eliminating the empty winter field ridges, the "May 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative took the lead, cultivating all of its 223 mu of field ridges and planting 38 jin of highland barley seeds, 48 jin of pea seeds, and 53 jin of broad bean seeds. It is estimated that next spring, over 3,300 jin of grain can be harvested. The ten mutual aid teams in the neighboring Changhong Village, seeing that the "May 1st" Agricultural Production Cooperative had cultivated the field ridges and planted grain, held meetings overnight to discuss the issue of cultivating empty field ridges to plant grain. After the meetings, each team took action. Currently, except for the field ridges reserved for walkways, all the empty field ridges have been eliminated. Generally, three-chi-wide field ridges are planted with four rows of highland barley, and two-chi-wide field ridges are planted with three rows. Currently, all of the township's over 14,000 mu of fields' empty winter field ridges have been planted with crops such as highland barley and broad beans, and it is estimated that next year, an additional 36,000 jin of highland barley and 16,000 jin of broad beans and peas can be produced.

    利用冬季空田坎种庄稼
    四川省崇宁县君平乡往年冬季有三分之一的田坎不挖，空着等明年大春点豆子。今年该乡党支部在领导小春生产中，发动全乡农民消灭冬季空田坎，为国家增产更多的粮食。在消灭冬季空田坎时，“五一”农业生产合作社，首先带头把全社二百二十三亩田的田坎全部挖出来，种上三十八斤青稞种，四十八斤豌豆种，五十三斤胡豆种，预计明年春天可收粮食三千三百多斤。邻近的长虹村十个互助组，看见“五一”农业生产合作社挖了田坎，种上粮食，就连夜召开会，讨论挖空田坎种粮食的问题。会后，各组都行动起来。目前除留作走道的田坎外，所有的空田坎都消灭了，一般三尺宽的田坎种青稞四行，二尺宽的田坎种三行。现在全乡一万四千多亩田的冬季空田坎都种上了青稞、胡豆等作物，估计明年可多增产青稞三万六千斤，胡豆、豌豆一万六千斤。
