　　Hubei disaster area people have returned to their hometowns in batches, and the local people's government, to ensure they safely spend the winter, has successively distributed large amounts of relief funds and clothing, including 1.22 million cotton-padded coats alone, and has vigorously organized the supply of grain, house repair materials, and other supplies. After December 3rd, snowfall became widespread in various places. The local Party committees and county committees of the Chinese Communist Party dispatched large numbers of cadres to form inspection teams to check on the winter conditions of disaster victims household by household. Many areas also established emergency repair teams or groups to work day and night to repair houses that could not withstand the cold. In Liu Lin Township, Second District of Mianyang, an emergency repair team repaired the houses of 88 households in two days. In some places, attention was also paid to educating farmers who had joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations to help households with a shortage of labor with emergency repairs. In Wangmiao Township, Fourth District of Honghu, the houses of 49 households of widowed, orphaned, elderly, and weak people who could not survive the winter were all contracted for emergency repairs by 21 mutual aid groups. In Huangmei County, the hardest-hit area of the Huanggang Special District, according to a survey of four districts, after emergency repairs before and after the arrival of the snowstorm, 95 percent of the houses were able to withstand the winter.

    湖北灾民安度第一次风雪
    湖北省灾区人民分批返乡后，当地人民政府为保证他们安全度过寒冬，先后发放了大批救济款和衣被等，其中仅棉衣即有一百二十二万件，并大力组织了粮食、房屋修建器材和其他物资的供应。十二月三日以后，各地普遍降雪，中共各地、县委都抽调大批干部组织检查组，逐户检查灾民过冬情况。很多地区并成立了抢修突击队或突击小组，日夜赶工抢修那些不能御寒的房屋。沔阳二区刘林乡突击抢修小组两天内便修整好了八十八户的房屋。有些地方，还注意教育加入互助合作组织的农民帮助缺劳动力的困难户抢修。洪湖四区王庙乡四十九户孤寡老弱不能过冬的房屋，全是由二十一个互助组包工抢修的。黄冈专区灾情最重的黄梅县，据四个区调查，经过风雪到来前后突击抢修，能过冬的房屋已达百分之九十五。
