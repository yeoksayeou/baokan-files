    "Apple Collective Farm"
    By our correspondent Liu Qun
    Two Years
    One day, Ma Zhenlu, the Party branch secretary of Bali Village in Jin County, saw the dense apple trees of the orchard cooperative on both sides of the hillside, with green branches and leaves, full of bright red apples, and felt an indescribable joy.
      "The mountain valley has also changed!" Ma Zhenlu said to his wife, Yu Chunzhi, "Looking at this, we can soon establish a collective farm."
      "By the time the collective farm is built, we might both be old and toothless," Yu Chunzhi said with some doubt.
      "As long as we work hard with our two hands, and with the leadership of the Party, it will be quick!" Ma Zhenlu was full of confidence.
    This was two years ago, when Ma Zhenlu was still the director of an orchard production cooperative.
    Now, this place has become the famous Friendship Orchard Collective Farm in the Dalian-Lushun area. Because it mainly produces apples, people call it the "Apple Collective Farm." Ma Zhenlu is the chairman of this farm; Yu Chunzhi is the deputy leader of the farm's Third Women's Production Team. Now, if anyone asks him about the words he said to Ma Zhenlu two years ago, he will laugh and answer, "At that time, I didn't expect to become one so quickly!"
    One evening, I met Ma Zhenlu in the farm's newly built club. He was writing the farm's work summary. He excitedly talked about the changes in the farm over the past two years.
    In two years, the mountain valley has changed its appearance of more than fifty years. The entire farm has more than 10,800 fruit-bearing trees. This year, it harvested 280,000 catties more fruit than last year, and the yield has more than doubled compared to mutual aid teams. The income of the average farmer has increased by one to two times compared to before joining the farm. This year, more than 200 households have requested to join this collective farm. Currently, the entire farm has 84 households. They are all living above the level of middle peasants. This year, 43 new houses have been built; more than 30 people have bought bicycles. The farm's public property is also constantly growing. Last year there were only 62 pigs, this year it has increased to 360. The public accumulation fund has increased from 200 million yuan to more than 600 million yuan.
      Towards Collectivization
    Before liberation, this village had 50,000 to 60,000 trees, most of which were in the hands of landlords "Cao the Second Scorpion" and "Yan Half-Slope." They used this as a tool to oppress and exploit the broad masses of peasants. Seventy-eight percent of the peasants in the village lived a life of poverty worse than that of cattle and horses. After liberation, the Party led the broad masses of peasants to carry out land reform. The government handed over the orchards confiscated from the landlords to the peasants for management, and called on the peasants to "organize" for production. At this time, village Party branch secretary Ma Zhenlu and Party member Wang Hongyuan led the peasants to organize two mutual aid teams. The peasants saw that "organizing is better than working alone," and the following year the mutual aid teams increased to twelve. By 1952, four production cooperatives had been organized. In collective labor, the peasants saw the future clearly, and with the Party carrying out socialist perspective education in the countryside, everyone's awareness was further raised, and they asked to merge the four cooperatives to establish a collective farm. The county Party committee approved their request and at the same time carried out extensive publicity in the village. At that time, some people in the village were still ideologically confused.
    Some people asked, "Can we keep our gardens and land when we join the farm?"
    Some people said, "Our cooperative has a lot of public accumulation funds, it's too much of a loss to merge together!"
    Older people said, "Too many people cause chaos, too many dragons cause drought, too many daughters-in-law cause the mother-in-law to cook."
    The Party branch committee, hearing these discussions, convened a Party member meeting, first carried out education within the Party, and then went separately to explain to the masses.
    The peasant Yu Yongfu, in the past, his family of five lived a poor life. After liberation, he bought twelve mu of good land and worked on his own. The land was right in the middle of the village. Looking forward, there was a vast expanse of sea, and on both sides were good mountains and rivers. He thought to himself, "When we're alive, the old couple can build a new house and live here, and when we die, we'll be buried in this land. It's really good feng shui." Many people in the village had joined the farm, and he wanted to join but was reluctant to part with his several mu of land. He walked on his land, picked up a clod of earth, and said to himself, "There's blood in this soil!" But then he saw that organizing together was really beneficial. He was also afraid that he would never be able to build a house after joining the farm. One day, Yu Yongfu was thinking wildly at home when Ma Zhenlu pushed the door open and came in.
    "How is your production this year?" Ma Zhenlu opened the conversation first.
    "Not bad this year, I can save more than eight million," Yu Yongfu deliberately exaggerated a little, "and there are pigs to sell to earn a little money, and I can accumulate some manure..." Ma Zhenlu asked, "How much is the net savings?" This stumped him. Then he told the truth and also expressed his concerns. He asked, "Can I still build a house after joining the farm?" Ma Zhenlu said, "The farm's production is high, and the farmers' income is high. As long as you can work hard, it's not just your problem of building a house, but the problem of building houses for other farmers can also be easily solved." After Yu Yongfu understood, the old couple joined the collective farm.
    The Party branch carried out meticulous persuasion and education work in response to everyone's concerns. The collective farm was officially established on June 15, 1952. They were divided into six production teams, launched a labor competition, and completed the pruning of 13,000 fruit trees ten days ahead of schedule. Immediately afterwards, the fertilization work was completed, and all the fruit trees were painted with white wash. Everyone said, "Chairman Mao's idea is right!"
    Ancient Trees Rejuvenated
    "Both people and trees have completely turned over!" This is a common saying among the farmers. Decades-old fruit trees have regained their youth.
    There is a patch of apple trees on the eastern slope, which are said to be twenty-two years old. In the hands of the landlord, each tree never bore more than sixty or seventy catties of fruit. The fruit trees looked like they had suffered a serious illness, lacking branches and leaves, looking like they couldn't survive. Now, in the hands of the collective farmers, the fruit trees are growing particularly vigorously. Large apples are weighing down the branches. This year, each fruit tree bore more than three hundred catties of fruit! This news spread throughout the village. Six trees were selected, top, middle, and bottom, and the apples were picked and weighed, totaling 2,040 catties, averaging 340 catties per tree. The quality was also very good, nine-tenths were good fruit, a 40 percent improvement in quality compared to last year. The old farmers who grew up in this village all said: Our ancestors never heard of so many fruits being produced!
    The farmer Chu Yutong worked for the landlord in this garden for fifteen years, and he knows this garden the best. In the hands of the landlord for twenty-two years, both people and trees suffered enough. He said: You didn't see, at that time, the tree trunks were all red, like people who couldn't get enough to eat. Every spring, depending on how many flowers the fruit trees had, fertilizer would be applied. If there were few flowers, no fertilizer would be applied; the pesticide used was always cheap. The grass under the trees was very deep. Apples that fell on the ground wouldn't break. There were 16,000 fruit trees in the whole village that suffered from rot and dieback! How could this produce more fruit?
    After the establishment of the farm, a broad road was opened for improving technology, allowing the damaged fruit trees to recover quickly. The peach fruit borer caused the greatest harm to apples. One worm breeds two generations and can damage 125 catties of apples. They found the law of its reproduction, used sieves to sift out more than twenty catties of peach fruit borer pupae, basically eliminating the pest. They carried out a lot of work: this year, they built 67,200 cubic meters of water and soil conservation projects, dug drainage ditches and reservoirs; increased manure fertilizer; and also improved in pruning techniques, implementing "reasonable branch retention" to increase yields. The old trees have become young again.
    Everyone Has Work
    On the farm, no matter what kind of person, they can be assigned suitable work. The socialist collective economy has highly developed individual initiative and creativity.
    Liu Zhengfang carried loads for the landlord his whole life. Not only did he not have anything left, but he also developed a sickness, and his voice still wheezes when he speaks. When the farm was established, he was worried and said to everyone, "What am I going to do? I'm already fifty-five years old, what can I do?"
      "You can raise pigs on the farm!" Ma Zhenlu told him, "Don't worry, pay according to labor, this time you will have a good life." From then on, Liu Zhengfang carefully raised sixty-two pigs. Once, a sow was about to give birth, and he was afraid that the sow would crush the newborn piglets, so he watched over them all day long. When it was cold, he took off his own fur coat and put it on the piglets. Others asked him, "Don't you think it's dirty?" He said, "Dirty clothes can be washed, but if the pigs freeze to death, they can't be cured." After such careful rearing, all sixty-two pigs grew fat and big-eared, each pig growing to more than two hundred catties that year, and saving 14,000 catties of grain. Last year, he earned more than eight million yuan according to his work points and was also selected as a livestock model. He happily said, "The collective farm doesn't waste materials, it truly allows everyone to do their best and receive more for more work!"
    They also established a childcare group, enabling all sixty-seven women on the farm to participate in labor. Wang Chunhua has two children. She said, "Before joining the farm, I thought to myself: I cook three meals a day, what else can I do? The farm has enabled someone like me to participate in labor."
      Sweet and Fragrant
    On the farm, many new things happen every day.
    In July of this year, the collective farm hitched up five rubber-wheeled carts, carrying more than a hundred farmers to the beach in Longwangmiao to take a bath. Wang Shuyu entrusted her five children to the farm's childcare group and also went. It was her first time to the beach, and she was a little scared of the sea, but she couldn't help but go down. She is a production expert. In the spring, she picked two hundred and forty catties of cherries a day, completing four work points in one day. She said to me:
  "I've never been able to go out in my life. If we didn't join the farm, how could we women go to the sea for a bath?"
    The cultural instructor of the collective farm told me: All thirty-odd school-age children on the farm have gone to primary school. Liu Baoheng didn't have the strength to send his daughter to school in the past. After joining the farm, his life improved, and he also sent his daughter to school. Forty adults have participated in spare-time school learning. Before class, in the open space of the cultural station, old students in their forties and fifties also play games with the young people. The farm chairman and team leaders have all participated in the learning. Now, they can all write letters of two or three hundred words.
    One rainy day, the farmers gathered together, some playing checkers, some playing cards. The women's team sang "Song of the Farmers of the Friendship Orchard Collective Farm":
    "On the high Phoenix Mountain slope,
    Apple trees are like a green ocean,
    When spring comes,
    Flowers bloom all over the hills,…………
    We want to make a solemn guarantee to Chairman Mao:
    To transport apples to all directions,
    To let hundreds of millions of working brothers,
    All eat our apples, sweet and fragrant.…………"
    Their lives are just like the apples they produce, "sweet and fragrant."
    The farm chairman Ma Zhenlu came, and he also sang along with everyone. He said to me, "The farmers' lives are happy. Now many farmers are planning to buy things and build houses after the autumn harvest distribution. Three young couples are getting married."
    Ma Zhenlu carefully calculated and said: "This year, the farm produced 1.07 million catties of apples, all of which were sold to the state. We will produce more and better apples next year to sell to the state. Exchanging apples for steel, our increased production of apples is supporting socialist construction?"
    "The rain has stopped!" someone shouted. Everyone immediately went to the orchard to pick apples in a flurry.

### “苹果集体农庄”

    “苹果集体农庄”
    本报记者　刘羣
    两年
    有一天，金县八里村支部书记麻振禄在路上看见山坡两旁果园合作社的密密层层的苹果树，青枝绿叶，结满通红的大苹果，心里真有说不出来的高兴。
      “山沟沟也变样了！”麻振禄向他爱人于春枝说，“看这样，快可以成立集体农庄了。”
      “等集体农庄建好，说不定咱们都得老掉了牙。”于春枝有些怀疑。
      “只要两只手劳动得好，有党的领导，那还不快！”麻振禄很有信心。
    这是两年前的事，那时候麻振禄还是一个果园生产合作社的主任。
    现在，这里已经成了旅大地区有名的友谊果园集体农庄了。因为它主要出产苹果，所以人们都管它叫“苹果集体农庄”。麻振禄就是这个农庄的主席；于春枝是农庄第三妇女生产队的副队长。现在，谁再问他两年前向麻振禄说过的话，他就笑着回答：“那时候，想不到能这样快当呀！”
    一天晚上，我在农庄新修的俱乐部里会见了麻振禄，他正在写农庄的工作总结。他兴奋地谈起两年来农庄的变化。
    两年的工夫，改变了山沟沟五十多年的模样。全庄有一万零八百多棵结果子的树，今年比去年多收了二十八万斤果子，产量比互助组提高了一倍多。一般庄员收入比入庄前提高了一倍到两倍。今年又有二百多户要求参加这个集体农庄。目前全农庄共有八十四户。他们都过着中农以上的生活；今年新盖了四十三间新房；有三十多人买了自行车。农庄里公有财产也不断增长。去年只有六十二口猪，今年增加到三百六十口了。公积金由二亿元增加到六亿多元。
      走向集体
    解放前，这村有五、六万棵树，大部分掌握在地主“曹二蝎子”“阎半坡”手中。他们把这当做压迫、剥削广大农民的工具。全村百分之七十八的农民过着牛马不如的贫农生活。解放后，党领导广大农民实行土地改革，政府把没收地主的果园交给农民经营，并且号召农民“组织起来”生产，这时，村支部书记麻振禄和党员王洪源领导农民组织了两个互助组。农民看到了“组织起来比单干好”，转过年互助组就增加到十二个。到一九五二年，已经组织起来四个生产合作社了。在集体劳动中，农民看清了前途，加上党在农村进行了社会主义远景教育，大家觉悟更加提高，纷纷要求把四个合作社合并成立集体农庄。县委批准了他们的要求，同时，又在村里进行了广泛的宣传。那时，村里还有一些人思想很混乱。
    有人问：“入庄能不能留园子地？”
    有人说：“我们社公积金多，合到一起吃亏太大！”
    年老的人说：“人多乱，龙多旱，媳妇多了婆婆做饭。”
    党支委听到这种议论，召开了党员大会，首先在党内进行了教育，然后分头向群众作了解释。
    农民于永福，过去一家五口过着穷日子，解放以后他买了十二亩好地，自己单干，土地正好在村当腰，向前看，远远一片海水，左右都是好山水。他自己想：“老两口子，活着盖个新房住在这里，死了埋到这块土上，真是好风水。”全村不少人都入庄了，他想入庄又心疼这几亩地。他走在自己的地上，拾起一块土块，自言自语地说：“这土里有血啊！”可是，又看到组织起来真有好处。他又怕入庄以后永远盖不起房子。一天于永福正在家中乱想，麻振禄推门进来了。
    “你今年生产怎么样？”麻振禄先开了口。
    “今年不赖，能剩八百多万。”于永福故意夸大了一点说，“还有猪卖了能进一份钱，还能积点粪……”麻振禄追问了一句：“净剩多少？”这下把他给问住了。随后他说了实话，把自己的顾虑也说出来了。他问：“入庄还能盖上房子？”麻振禄说：“农庄生产高，庄员收入多，只要能好好劳动，不只你盖房子的问题，就是其他庄员盖房子的问题都容易解决。”于永福明白了以后，老两口子参加了集体农庄。
    党支部针对每个人的疑虑作了细致的说服教育工作。集体农庄在一九五二年六月十五日正式成立了。他们分成六个生产队，发动了劳动竞赛，提前十天完成了一万三千棵果树的剪枝工作；紧接着完成了施肥工作，果树全刷上了白涂剂。大家都说：“毛主席出的主意就是对！”
    古树回春
    “人和树都彻底翻身了！”这是庄员们常说的一句话。几十年的老果树恢复了青春。
    东山坡有一片苹果树，算起来有二十二年的历史，在地主手里每棵树从未结过六、七十斤果，果树像害了一场大病，缺枝少?，活不了的样子。现在，在集体农民手里，果树长得特别旺盛。大苹果压得树枝弯弯的。今年每棵果树结的果子超过了三百斤！这个消息传遍了全村。选好上中下六棵树，把苹果摘下来一秤，一共是二千零四十斤，每棵平均结三百四十斤。质量也很好，十分之九是好果，比去年质量提高百分之四十。生长在这村的老庄员都说：祖辈从来也没听说结这么多果啊！
    庄员楚玉桐在这个园子给地主干了十五年，他对这个园子最清楚。在地主手里二十二年，人和树都苦的够呛。他说：你没看见，那时，树本都红赤赤的，就像人吃不饱一样，每年春天看果树开花多少上肥料，花要少就不喂肥；药水专打贱的。树底下草很深，苹果掉在地上，都摔不坏，全村光生腐烂病、枯死病的就有一万六千棵果树！这样怎么能多结果？
    农庄成立以后，为改进技术开辟了广阔的道路，使被破坏了的果树迅速恢复过来。桃小食心虫给苹果带来害处最大。一个虫子繁殖两代，能损害一百二十五斤苹果，他们找到了它繁殖的规律，用筛子筛，将桃小食心虫蛹筛出来二十多斤，基本上消灭了虫害。他们进行了不少工作：今年修建了六万七千二百公方的水土保持工程，挖了排水沟、蓄水池；增加了粪肥；在剪枝技术方面也改进了，实行“合理留枝”，提高了产量。老树又年轻起来了。
    人人都有工作
    在农庄里，不论什么样的人，都能分到适宜的工作。社会主义集体经济，高度发挥了个人的积极性、创造性。
    刘正方给地主扛一辈子活，不但什么没剩下，反倒落了一身病，一说话嗓子还“呼噜呼噜”直喘。农庄一成立，他可愁了，逢人就说：“我怎么办，都五十五岁了，干什么？”
      “你在农庄里喂猪吧！”麻振禄告诉他：“不用愁，按劳取酬，这回你就过好日子了。”从这以后，刘正方细心饲养六十二口猪。有一次一只母猪要生崽子了，他怕母猪压死新生的小猪，整天看着，天冷他把自己的皮袄脱下来给小猪盖上。别人问他：“不嫌脏？”他说：“衣裳脏了能洗，猪冷死了就治不活。”经过这样细心饲养，六十二口猪都长得肥头大耳的，当年一口猪长到二百多斤重，并节省了一万四千斤粮食。去年他按劳动日收入了八百多万元，还被选为畜牧模范。他高兴地说：“集体农庄不屈材料，真是各尽所能，多劳多得呀！”
    他们还成立了看孩子小组，使农庄六十七名妇女全部参加了劳动。王春花有两个孩子，她说：“没入庄以前，自己想：我一天做三顿饭，还能干什么？农庄使我这样人也能参加劳动了。”
      又甜又香
    在农庄里，每天都发生很多新鲜的事情。
    今年七月，集体农庄套上五辆胶轮大车，载着一百多个庄员，到龙王庙海边上洗澡了。王淑玉把五个小孩交给了农庄的看孩子小组，也去了。她第一次到海边，见海水有些害怕；可是她忍不住也下去了。她是一个生产能手，春天她一天摘二百四十斤樱桃，一天完成四个劳动日。她向我说：
  “成辈子出不去门，不入农庄，咱们妇女哪能到海里去洗个澡。”
    集体农庄里的文化教员告诉我：全庄有三十多名学龄儿童都上了小学。柳宝恒过去没力量送自己女儿念书，参加农庄后，生活好了，也送女儿上学了。成年人有四十名参加了业余学校学习。上课前，在文化站的空场上，四五十岁的老学员，也和青年人一起做游戏。农庄主席，队长都参加了学习，现在，他们都能写二三百字的信了。
    一个下雨天，庄员们聚在一起，有的下跳棋，有的打扑克；妇女队唱起了“友谊果园集体农庄庄员之歌”：
    “在那高高的凤凰山坡上，
    苹果树像一片绿色的海洋，
    春天到来，
    花儿开满山岗，…………
    我们要向毛主席提出庄严的保证：
    要把苹果运到四面八方，
    要让千百万劳动的兄弟们，
    都吃到我们的苹果，又甜又香。…………”
    他们的生活，也正像他们生产出来的苹果一样，“又甜又香”。
    农庄主席麻振禄来了，他也随大家唱起来。他向我说：“庄员们生活就是愉快，现在庄员不少人都打算秋收分配以后添买东西、盖房子，有三对青年要结婚。”
    麻振禄细算着说：“今年农庄生产了一百零七万斤苹果，全卖给国家了；明年要生产更多更好的苹果卖给国家。拿苹果换钢铁，我们多生产苹果就是支援社会主义建设？”
    “雨停了！”有人喊了一声。大家立刻到果园里紧张地摘苹果去了。
