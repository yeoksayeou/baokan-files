    Winter Construction at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant

    After exceeding the factory building construction target for two consecutive months, the workers of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant achieved victory in winter construction in November. As of November 30th, they had completed 110.5 percent of the monthly plan.

    November was the first month of winter construction. The work accounts for 34.7 percent of the entire winter construction workload. The main projects include concrete pouring, bricklaying, soil insulation, and hoisting of concrete components. The temperature this month is usually below 0 degrees Celsius, but the construction workers' enthusiasm is high. They carried out the construction in accordance with the operating procedures and ensured the quality of the project. New achievements continue to emerge. The workers in the reinforcing steel workshop completed the entire month's task within fourteen days. The workers of the Fifth Detachment of the car body pressing workshop had twenty different engineering tasks this month, all of which were continuously overfulfilled. Among them, backfilling was overfulfilled by 382.9 percent, and the laying of rubble and spall subbase was overfulfilled by 457.4 percent. The Concrete Second Detachment constructing the thermal power plant has overfulfilled its tasks several times and won the Red Flag Award four times. The youth shock brigade of the foundry workshop studies winter construction specifications during the evenings after working during the day since entering winter construction. They also completed their tasks in pouring concrete wall panels.

    Now the temperature here has dropped below minus ten degrees Celsius. The workers are fighting the cold and are preparing to strive to complete the December construction plan with greater efforts. (Zheng Kang, Ding Shui)

    第一汽车制造厂冬季施工
    建设第一汽车制造厂的职工，在一连两月超额完成厂房建设任务后，十一月份又取得了冬季施工的胜利。到十一月三十日止，一共完成了月计划的百分之一百一十点五。
    十一月份是进入冬季施工的第一个月。工程占整个冬季施工工作量的百分之三十四点七。其中主要项目有混凝土浇灌、砌砖、土壤保温、混凝土构件吊装等。这个月的气温通常都在摄氏零度以下，但施工人员的热情很高，他们按着操作规程进行了施工，并保证了工程质量。新的成绩仍不断出现。钢筋车间的职工，在十四天内完成了全月任务。车身压制工场五中队的职工，这个月中有二十项不同的工程任务，也都连续超额完成。其中回填土超额百分之三百八十二点九，铺碎石片石垫层超额完成百分之四百五十七点四。建设热电站的混凝土二中队，数次超额完成任务，四次获得红旗奖。铸工场的青年突击队员，在进入冬季施工以来，白天工作，夜晚学习冬季施工规范，他们在浇灌混凝土板墙任务中也完成了任务。
    现在这里的气温已降至摄氏零下十度以下，职工们和寒冷斗争着，准备以更大的努力来争取完成十二月份的施工计划。（正康  丁水）
