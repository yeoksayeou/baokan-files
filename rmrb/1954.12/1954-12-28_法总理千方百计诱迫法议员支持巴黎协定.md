    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 27th: French newspapers report that Mendes-France is doing everything possible to exert influence on certain parliamentarians during the National Assembly's recess, attempting to force some parliamentarians who oppose arming West Germany to abstain from voting on the 27th, and to compel some parliamentarians who originally abstained to change their votes to affirmative.

    On December 26th, the Mendes-France government took another measure to deceive and gain support, stipulating an increase in family allowances. An Associated Press correspondent in Paris unreservedly pointed out that Mendes-France's "unexpected" move was clearly aimed at winning people's "support for the most unpopular issue he is fighting for - the rearmament of Germany."

    Agence France-Presse reported that Mendes-France will "emphasize to the National Assembly the serious international consequences of rejecting this (Paris) agreement" before the National Assembly vote. He is prepared to rely on the crude intimidation of France by the United States and Britain to threaten parliamentarians into supporting the Paris Agreement.

    Newspapers report that some are already intimidating parliamentarians, saying that if a majority of parliamentarians oppose the arming of West Germany again, the United States and Britain will "not forgive" the French parliament.

    The "Sunday Journal" threatened right-wing parliamentarians, especially members of the Popular Republican Movement, saying that once the Mendes-France government resigns, there can be no majority again.

    法总理千方百计诱迫法议员支持巴黎协定
    【新华社二十七日讯】巴黎消息：法国报纸报道，孟戴斯—弗朗斯千方百计利用国民议会休会期间，对某些议员施加影响，企图迫使一些反对武装西德的议员在二十七日表决中弃权，并且迫使一些原来弃权的议员改投赞成票。
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府二十六日又采取了一项骗取支持的措施，规定提高家庭津贴。合众社驻巴黎记者毫不掩饰地指出，孟戴斯—弗朗斯“出人意外”的此举的目的，显然是在争取人们“支持这个他正在为之斗争的最不得人心的问题——重新武装德国”。
    法新社消息说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯在国民议会表决前将“向国民议会强调说明拒绝这个（巴黎）协定的严重国际后果”。他准备依靠美国和英国对法国的粗暴恫吓，来威胁议员支持巴黎协定。
    报纸报道，有人已在恐吓议员说：如果大多数议员再度反对武装西德，美国和英国将“不能宽恕”法国议会。
    “星期日报”威吓右翼议员，特别是人民共和党议员说：孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府一旦辞职，就不可能再有多数。
