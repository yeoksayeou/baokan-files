    Xicun Cement Plant's No. 3 Rotary Kiln
    Sets New Safety Record Again
    Guangzhou's state-owned Xicun Cement Plant's No. 3 rotary kiln has been operating safely for one year (i.e., 365 days) from December 4, 1953, to December 4 this year, once again setting a new national safety record.
    Since liberation, the Xicun Cement Plant has set the national safety record five consecutive times. During this safety run, the advanced experience of the Soviet rapid rotary kiln was promoted. The workers often paid attention to preventing and overcoming any possibility that could affect safe operation. Therefore, the daily output of this safe operation increased by 12.81% compared to the fourth safe operation, increasing the production of clinker by more than 22,100 metric tons, and saving two repair costs. The two items together increased production and saved the country 7.883 billion yuan in wealth. (Our Guangdong Reporter Station)

    西村水泥厂第三号回转窑
    再创安全运转新纪录
    广州市国营西村水泥厂第三号回转窑从一九五三年十二月四日开窑到今年十二月四日止，已经安全运转了一年（即三百六十五天），再次创造了全国安全运转的新纪录。
    西村水泥厂自解放以来，曾经连续五次创造安全运转的全国最高纪录。这次安全运转期间推行了苏联快速转窑的先进经验，工人们经常注意防止和克服任何足以影响安全运转的可能性，因此这次安全运转比第四次安全运转日产量提高百分之十二点八一，增产了熟料二万二千一百余公吨，并且节约了两次修理费用，两项共给国家增产节约了七十八亿八千三百万元的财富。　（本报广东记者站）
