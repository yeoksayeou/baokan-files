Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 12th: Factories and mines in Hunan Province are preparing for next year's production. Drafts of production, technology, and financial plans for next year have been initially formulated by most state-owned factories and mines in the province and all local state-owned factories and mines. The factories and mines are making preparations for next year's production based on the draft production plans and the weak links in production.

Many non-ferrous metal mines and coal mines are actively carrying out mine design, mining preparation, and exploratory tunneling for next year. Zixing Coal Mine excavated 3,600 meters of roadways in November for the needs of next year's production, and plans to excavate another 3,090 meters in December. The local state-owned Yangmeishan Coal Mine is also carrying out coal exploration projects and well deepening projects in the main mining area for next year.

The state-owned and local state-owned machinery factories are also actively preparing for the production of new products next year. Designers at Xiangtan Electric Machinery Factory are designing a new type of switchboard for production in the first quarter of next year. Jianxiang Machinery Factory will trial-produce and produce new agricultural implements for southern paddy fields next year and has now sent three survey teams to go deep into the countryside to listen to farmers' opinions.

Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, Beijing People's Machinery Factory, Beijing General Machinery Factory, and other four factories will manufacture more than 74,000 new animal-powered agricultural implements such as double-wheeled double-share plows and rocker-arm harvesters for farmers in 1955. The raw materials for each factory are generally complete, and various production preparations are underway.

In early October, after the First Ministry of Machine Building issued the specifications and unified standard drawings for the double-wheeled double-share plow, the Beijing People's Machinery Factory and Beijing General Machinery Factory organized workers and technicians to study at the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory. Some technicians also directly participated in the work of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory in modifying tool drawings. The Beijing People's Machinery Factory used to manufacture civil engineering machinery, but now this factory has established a double-wheeled double-share plow workshop.

    湖南省各厂矿进行明年生产准备工作
    北京农业机械厂等厂明年将制造七万多部农具
    【新华社长沙十二日电】湖南省各厂矿正在进行明年生产的准备工作。省内大部分国营厂矿和全部地方国营厂矿明年的生产、技术和财务计划草案，已经初步订出。各厂矿正根据明年的生产计划草案和生产上的薄弱环节，进行明年生产准备工作。
    许多有色金属矿和煤矿矿山正在积极进行明年的采矿设计、采矿准备和探巷掘进等工作。资兴煤矿十一月份已为明年生产的需要掘进了三千六百公尺巷道，十二月份内计划再掘进三千零九十公尺。地方国营杨梅山煤矿也在明年主要的采煤区，进行探煤工程和井身加深等工程。
    各国营和地方国营的机械厂，也积极为明年生产新产品做准备。湘潭电机厂设计人员正在设计明年第一季生产的一种新型开关板。建湘机械厂明年将试制和生产南方水田用的新式农具，现在已派出三个调查组深入农村听取农民意见。
    【新华社十二日讯】北京农业机械厂、北京人民机器厂、北京市通用机械厂等四个工厂一九五五年要为农民制造七万四千多部双轮双铧犁、摇臂式收割机等新式畜力农具。现在各厂原材料大致齐备，正进行各项生产准备工作。
    十月初，当第一机械工业部发下双轮双铧犁的规格和统一标定的图纸后，北京人民机器厂、北京市通用机械厂就组织工人和技术人员到北京农业机械厂去学习。部分技术人员还直接参加了北京农业机械厂修改工具图纸的工作。北京人民机器厂过去制造的是土木建筑机械，现在这个厂已成立了双轮双铧犁车间。
