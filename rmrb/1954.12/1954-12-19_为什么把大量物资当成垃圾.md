Editor's Note: Readers Ding Zhilin et al. wrote to reflect the situation of Anshan Iron and Steel Company discarding a large number of waste metals as garbage. Upon investigation by the reader来信组 of Anshan Worker's Life Newspaper entrusted by this newspaper, it is proven to be true. This phenomenon of wasting state property should never continue. Anshan Iron and Steel Company should promptly examine this issue and take effective measures to resolve it.

It should be pointed out that this phenomenon also exists in other industrial and mining units. For example, in October of this year, iron smelting workers at Chongqing 101 Iron and Steel Plant picked up many steel plates from the iron slag heap in the steelmaking workshop, the largest of which weighed more than 700 kilograms. As for the phenomenon of arbitrarily discarding scrap materials, it is even more common. We hope that readers will widely expose this type of phenomenon so that this behavior of not cherishing state property can be corrected under mass supervision.

Comrades Editors:

The North Gate of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is near the villages of Dongtai and Chengangbao in the second district of Anshan City. This is where Ansteel transports garbage from the plant every day by the truckload. Here, people can see a startling phenomenon: whether day or night, every time a garbage truck comes out, two hundred or more people, men, women, old and young, rush to pick things up.

What's in the garbage? There are many valuable things: iron plates, steel bricks, copper blocks, tin sheets... you name it, all are picked up in sacks; and the "waste cloths" for wiping machinery are generally three or four feet long. After washing, they are almost as good as new. It is very common for a person to sell things picked up here for 30,000 yuan a day. Metals weighing dozens of kilograms have also appeared in the garbage. Jin Wenshan, a resident of Dongtai Village, once picked up a large copper sheet weighing fifty or sixty kilograms and sold it for more than 300,000 yuan; some people also picked up bundles of steel wire ropes. Once, a garbage truck pulled out an iron cylinder more than one zhang (approximately 3.3 meters) long. If this iron cylinder were used to make the cylinder of a large foreign stove, it could be cut into seven or eight pieces; the workers transporting the garbage couldn't bear to throw it away after seeing it, so they pulled it back into the plant.

This situation has affected the enthusiasm of some local farmers for agricultural production. Some farmers in Dongtai and Chengangbao villages do not engage in production properly, and regard picking things up as a "sideline"; the income from this "sideline" is not only enough to support a family, but even some farmers' houses in Dongtai Village are built with steel bricks picked up from the garbage.

The broad masses of farmers are very dissatisfied with this phenomenon. They say: In order to increase production and practice thrift, and support Ansteel, we even pick up a fallen grain; but they are discarding state property in large quantities, what is the reason for this? We believe that this accusation is completely justified. Anshan Iron and Steel Company should immediately correct this phenomenon of wasting state property.

Investigation by the Reader 来信组 of Anshan Worker's Life Newspaper

The situation reflected by readers Ding Zhilin et al. is true. Now we will make some supplementary explanations on the following points:

The phenomenon of Ansteel discarding waste materials as garbage has existed for a long time, and it does not only appear outside the North Gate. The amount of loss this has caused to the country cannot be calculated now. According to our understanding, the Chengangbao Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone has purchased more than 360,000 jin of waste metal picked up by the masses from July to the present, including more than 10,000 jin of waste copper, more than 5,000 jin of lead, with a total value of more than 200 million yuan.

There are also cases of farmers not actively engaging in agricultural production in order to pick things up. According to the village head of Chengangbao Village: "In August and September of this year, some mutual aid group members felt that farming didn't bring in quick money, so they were not at ease with production and went to pick up waste steel and iron." For example, Wei Zhenjia, a farmer in Chengangbao Village, earned more than 3 million yuan just by picking things up in the second half of this year.

Now, there are fewer people抢 picking up waste steel. This is not because there is no waste steel in the garbage, but because, starting in November, the Anshan Municipal People's Government, in order to take care of the lives of revolutionary martyrs' families, military families, and widows and orphans, organized them (a total of more than 30 people) to form a scavenger team to pick up waste steel here, and ordinary farmers and peddlers can no longer go to pick it up.

Regarding this issue, Anshan Worker's Life Newspaper has criticized it twice before, on February 19th and April 20th of this year. At that time, the leaders of Ansteel paid attention to the newspaper's criticism. They issued a circular within the company, ordering the slag plant to inspect the garbage transported out of various plants, and set up armed guards at the garbage dump to prevent nearby residents from picking things up. However, the farmers still went to pick things up at night with candles, and the guards couldn't stop them, so they stopped going. The slag plant's work of inspecting garbage soon became a mere formality. Therefore, the situation is still quite serious until now. We believe that Anshan Iron and Steel Company should find ways to completely solve this problem from within the various plants.

    为什么把大量物资当成垃圾
    编者按：读者丁祉林等来信反映鞍山钢铁公司把大批废金属当垃圾丢弃的情况，经本报委托鞍山工人生活报读者来信组调查，证明是确实的。这种浪费国家财产的现象，决不应再继续下去。鞍山钢铁公司应该迅速检查这个问题，并采取有效办法加以解决。
    应该指出，这种现象在其它工矿单位也是存在的。如今年十月，重庆一零一钢铁厂炼铁工人曾在炼钢车间的铁渣堆里拣出了很多钢板，其中最大的一块竟有七百多公斤。至于把零料废料任意丢弃的现象就更多。希望读者广泛地揭发这一类现象，使这种不爱护国家财产的行为在群众监督下得到纠正。编辑同志：
    鞍山钢铁公司北大门靠近鞍山市郊第二区的东台、城昂堡等村，这是鞍钢每天成车成车地把场内垃圾往外运的地方。在这里，人们可以看到一个令人吃惊的现象：不论白天黑夜，每逢一趟垃圾车出来，就有男女老少二百多人争先恐后地拥上去抢着拣东西。
    垃圾里有些什么呢？贵重的东西可多啦：铁板、钢砖、铜块、锡片……什么都有，都是成麻袋地被人拣走；还有擦机械的“废布”，一般都有三四尺长，拿回去一洗就和新布差不远。一个人一天在这里拣到的东西卖三万元，这是很平常的事。垃圾里还出现过好几十斤重的金属。东台村居民金文山曾经拣到了一块五、六十斤重的大铜片，卖了三十多万元；有人还拣到了成捆的钢丝绳。有一次，垃圾车拉出了一个一丈多长的铁筒，这个铁筒如果用来做大洋炉子的炉筒，也能割七、八个；运垃圾的工人看到后不忍心丢，才把它拉回了场内。
    这样的情况已经影响了当地部分农民从事农业生产的积极性。东台、城昂堡两村有些农民不好好生产，把拣东西当“副业”；搞这种“副业”的收入，不但足够供一家吃用，甚至在东台村有一些农民的住房也是用拣来的钢砖砌的。
    广大的农民群众对这种现象是非常不满意的。他们说：我们为了增产节约，支援鞍钢，连掉了一颗粮食都要拣起来；而他们居然把国家的财产大批大批地丢掉，这是什么道理。我们认为，这个指责是完全正当的。鞍山钢铁公司应该立即纠正这种浪费国家财产的现象。

    鞍山工人生活报读者来信组的调查
    读者丁祉林等反映的情况是确实的。现在我们对下面几点作一些补充说明：
    鞍钢把废料当垃圾丢掉的现象由来已久，而且也不只出现在北大门外一个地方。这究竟给国家造成了多少损失，现在不能计算出来。据我们了解，仅城昂堡村一个供销合作社，从今年七月到现在，收购群众所拣的废金属就有三十六万多斤，其中有废铜一万多斤，铅五千多斤，总价值达两亿元以上。
    农民为了拣东西而不积极从事农业生产的情况也是有的。据城昂堡村村长说：“在今年八、九月份，有些互助组组员嫌种地不来现钱，不安心生产，就去拣废钢废铁去了。”如城昂堡村农民魏振加今年下半年光拣东西，就挣了三百多万元。
    现在，抢拣废钢铁的人少了。这不是因为垃圾里没有废钢铁了，而是因为从十一月起，鞍山市人民政府为了照顾烈属、军属和孤寡的生活，组织他们（共三十多人）成立拾物小组到这里来拣废钢铁，一般农民和小贩就不能再去拣了。
    对于这个问题，鞍山工人生活报在今年二月十九日和四月二十日曾先后两次提出批评。当时鞍钢领导方面对报纸的批评是重视的。他们在公司内发了通报，责成矿渣厂检查各厂外运的垃圾，并在垃圾场设武装警卫，不许附近居民去拣东西。但是农民仍然在黑天半夜提着烛灯去拣东西，警卫也制止不住，因此就不去了。矿渣厂检查垃圾的工作不久也逐渐流于形式了。所以，直到现在情况仍然相当严重。我们认为，鞍山钢铁公司应该从各厂内部来设法彻底解决这个问题。
