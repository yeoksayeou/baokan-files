Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 5th: TASS Paris, December 5th: De Gaulle delivered a speech at a mass rally in Paris on the 4th.

	De Gaulle called France's rejection of the "European Defense Community" treaty "the first sign of healthy development in eight years."

	While saying that the London and Paris Agreements "are inherently more desirable," De Gaulle advocated negotiating with the Soviet Union before ratifying these agreements.

	De Gaulle said: "Before realizing a system containing the rearmament of Germany, a factor that harbors major, unpredictable consequences, it is necessary to determine through clear negotiations: Is it possible to ease the international situation? The standard for this easing should be the universal implementation of supervised restrictions on all types of armaments everywhere."

	He said: He believes that arming Germany can only be considered justified if it is already impossible to ease the international situation.

	De Gaulle continued: "However, if such easing is possible, then for the sake of humanity, for the sake of civilization and Europe, every effort must be made to reach a temporary agreement so that Germany's sovereignty, unity, and security, like those of other countries, are guaranteed by international law."

	He emphasized: France should propose holding such negotiations because the remilitarization of Germany threatens France first. He said: "Due to previously concluded alliances and the Franco-Soviet treaty, France should negotiate with Russia first. Historically, geographically, and politically, France is the first to have reason to try to build a bridge to the Eastern Bloc."

	De Gaulle also believed that the North Atlantic Alliance caused France to lose its military and political independence. He said: "In the system called the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, France has no way to act independently" because France "has handed over its troops, bases, and transportation lines to others to manage."

	He added: "It [France] is in such a subordinate position that any military or even political action it takes on federal territory is subject to foreign supervision." (De Gaulle was referring to Indochina and North Africa.) He also expressed dissatisfaction with the following situation: "The United States still retains the right to distribute weapons it supplies to various countries according to its own wishes. This is contrary to the spirit of European unity."

	Speaking of the Saar issue, he believed that a thorough resolution of this issue is a necessary condition for establishing "European institutions." He emphasized: The American "guarantee" of the Saar is ineffective.

    戴高乐说西德重新武装首先威胁着法国
    他主张批准巴黎协定以前先同苏联谈判
   【新华社五日讯】塔斯社巴黎五日讯：戴高乐四日在巴黎群众集会上发表演说。
    戴高乐把法国拒绝批准“欧洲防务集团”条约称为“八年来第一个健康发展的标志”。
    戴高乐一方面说伦敦和巴黎协定“本身是比较可取的”，另一方面主张在批准这些协定以前同苏联谈判。
    戴高乐说：“在实现一个包含着重新武装德国这样一个孕育着难以预测的重大后果的因素的体系以前，必须通过明确的谈判来确定：是不是可能缓和国际局势。这种缓和的标准应当是在所有的地方普遍地实行对各种武装的有监督的限制。”
    他说：他认为，只有在已经不可能缓和国际局势的情况下，武装德国才能被认为是有理由的。
    戴高乐接着说：“但是，这种缓和如果有可能，那么，为了人类，为了文明和欧洲，就必须竭力达成一项暂时的协议，以便使德国的主权、统一和安全，像其他国家的一样，得到国际法规的保障。”
    他着重指出：法国应当建议举行这种谈判，因为德国重新军国主义化首先威胁着法国。他说：“由于以前缔结的联盟和法苏条约，法国应当首先同俄国谈判。在历史上、地理上和政治上，正是法国首先有理由来尝试架起通向东方集团的桥梁。”
    戴高乐还认为北大西洋联盟使法国丧失了军事上和政治上的独立。他说：“在名为北大西洋公约组织的体系中，法国没有任何办法独立行动”，因为法国“把自己的军队、基地和交通线都交给别人去管辖了”。
    他又说：“它（法国）处在这样的附属地位：它在联邦领土上所采取的任何军事的以至于政治的行动，都得受外国的监督。”（戴高乐所指的是在印度支那和北非）他还对下列情况表示不满：“美国到现在还保留着这样的权利：把它供给各国的武器按照它自己的意思分配给各国。这是违反欧洲团结的精神的。”
    他谈到萨尔问题时，认为彻底解决这个问题是建立“欧洲机构”必不可缺的条件。他强调指出：美国对萨尔的“保证”是没有效力的。
