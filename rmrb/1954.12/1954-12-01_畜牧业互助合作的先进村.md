    Advanced Village in Animal Husbandry Mutual Aid and Cooperation

	In the Hulunbuir Grassland of Inner Mongolia, an advanced village in animal husbandry mutual aid and cooperation has emerged - Hatanhushuo Baga. Thirty-four of the thirty-five Mongolian herding families in this Baga have joined the animal husbandry production cooperatives and mutual aid teams.

	This spring, after the news that the Huheletai animal husbandry production mutual aid team was preparing to expand into a cooperative spread, many herders in the Baga requested to join. However, the newly built cooperative could not absorb them for the time being, so Huheletai and others were responsible for helping them establish mutual aid teams first. Thus, three new animal husbandry production mutual aid teams were established within the Baga. After these mutual aid teams were established, the Huheletai animal husbandry production cooperative often shared its experience in running mutual aid teams, and specifically helped them implement labor division, improve grazing methods, etc. During summer and autumn production, the Xilanohai mutual aid team and the Shaobao mutual aid team lacked sufficient manpower and livestock power, so the cooperative jointly moved fields and jointly harvested grass with them. The cooperative members also guided the mutual aid team herders to learn and master the technology of grass mowers, repaired grass mowers for them, and lent them draught oxen for pulling carts. In mid-November, the two mutual aid teams smoothly completed their winter preparations. They also accepted the guidance of the cooperative and combined the team members with the cattle and sheep herds for joint winter grazing.

	The Huheletai animal husbandry production cooperative is also very concerned about Mengke, an individual herder. Mengke is now unable to store forage and build livestock sheds, so the cooperative allows his cattle herd to be raised in the cooperative for the winter.

	The herders of Hatanhushuo Baga recognize the benefits of the cooperativization of animal husbandry production. At present, the herders who have not joined the cooperative have formally submitted applications to the cooperative, requesting to join. (Xinhua News Agency)

    畜牧业互助合作的先进村
      内蒙古呼伦贝尔草原上，出现了一个畜牧业互助合作的先进村——哈坦胡硕巴嘎。这个巴嘎的三十五户蒙族牧民，已有三十四户参加了畜牧业生产合作社和互助组。
    今年春天，胡和勒泰畜牧业生产互助组准备扩建为合作社的消息传出后，巴嘎里的许多牧民要求参加，但新建的合作社暂时不可能吸收他们入社，于是就由胡和勒泰等负责帮助他们先办好互助组。这样，巴嘎内又建立了三个新的畜牧业生产互助组。这些互助组成立后，胡和勒泰畜牧业生产合作社常常给他们介绍办好互助组的经验，并具体地帮助他们实行劳动力分工，改进放牧方法等，在夏季和秋季生产中，西拉诺海互助组和哨宝互助组缺乏足够的人力和畜力，合作社便和他们联合移场，联合打草。合作社社员们还指导互助组牧民学习掌握打草机的技术，替他们检修打草机，并出借拉车用的犍牛。十一月中旬，这两个互助组顺利地完成了过冬准备，他们又接受合作社的指导，把组员和牛、羊群联合在一起，共同进行冬季放牧。
    胡和勒泰畜牧业生产合作社对单干牧民孟克也很关心。现在孟克无力储备草料和建造畜舍，合作社允许他的牛群放在社内饲养过冬。
    哈坦胡硕巴嘎牧民们认识到畜牧业生产合作化的好处，目前未入社的牧民们正式向合作社提出申请，要求入社。（新华社）
