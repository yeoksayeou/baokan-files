　　State-Owned Mechanized Farms Increase to 103
　　Heilongjiang Prepares to Build a Mechanized Farm Covering Over 10,000 Hectares

　　[This newspaper dispatch] Our country's state-owned mechanized farms have greatly developed this year. Forty-three new state-owned farms have been built this year, bringing the total number to 103, including the original ones. Although many state-owned farms suffered severe floods this year, crop yields still increased significantly, and costs were also significantly reduced. The average yield of wheat per mu on the original national farms (excluding those newly built this year) was more than 163 jin, an increase of 79% over last year; the average yield of rice per mu was 456 jin, an increase of more than 7% over last year. Fifty-five major national farms across the country have completed and exceeded their plans for submitting profits.

　　After studying the general task of the state during the transition period, the staff of state-owned farms in various regions have clearly recognized the socialist nature of state-owned farms, actively implemented the construction policy of "less investment, quick results, large harvests, and no competition with the people for land," and initially implemented quota management in business management, reducing non-production personnel; significant improvements have also been made in variety selection, seed treatment, fertilization, and mechanical technology. Some farms have developed diversified production, implemented reasonable crop rotation and integration of farming and animal husbandry, so that production continues to increase and income becomes more stable. This year, many farms suffered different degrees of losses due to severe disasters, but Jin Yuan, Lu Tai, Wu Li Dian, Shuang Qiao, and Yong Nian farms, which have developed multi-departmental operations and better integration of farming and animal husbandry, can still maintain profitability.

　　State-owned farms have played a demonstration role for the broad masses of farmers. The unit area yields of major crops such as wheat, rice, soybeans, and cotton on national state-owned farms are, on average, higher than those of farmers. For example, the average wheat yield is more than 42% higher than the national average yield, and rice is more than 27% higher. Under the influence and assistance of state-owned farms, many agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers have also improved their technology and increased production.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th: Heilongjiang Province is preparing to build a mechanized farm covering more than 10,000 hectares of land. The overall planning and design plan for the land of this farm is about to be completed. The entire farm will be fully completed in 1958. After the completion of this farm, it will have a general headquarters, three branch headquarters, eleven production teams, and a livestock farm, with a land area of 13,139 hectares, a livestock farm area of 700 hectares, and afforestation of 5,425 hectares. It will produce tens of thousands of tons of grain for the country every year.

　　The site of this mechanized farm is on a large area of wasteland near the Keshan Mechanized Farm. This wasteland is 30 kilometers long from east to west and more than 9 kilometers long from north to south, with a total area of 26,800 hectares; except for a very small number of abandoned lands, the rest are virgin wastelands that have never been cultivated; the terrain is flat, suitable for mechanized farming; the soil quality is very good, the frost-free period is 115 days a year, and the annual rainfall is about 600 millimeters, which is very suitable for the growth of crops, especially for the cultivation of wheat and soybeans.

    国营机械农场发展到一百零三个
    黑龙江筹建占地一万多公顷的机械农场
    【本报讯】我国国营机械农场今年有很大发展。全国今年又新建四十三个国营农场，连同原有的，已达一百零三个。今年许多国营农场虽然遭受了严重水灾，但农作物产量仍有很大提高，成本也显著降低。全国原有农场（不包括今年新建的场）小麦每亩平均产量一百六十三斤多，比去年提高百分之七十九；水稻每亩平均产量四百五十六斤，比去年提高百分之七多。全国五十五个主要农场已完成和超额完成上缴利润的计划。
    各地国营农场工作人员经过国家过渡时期总任务学习以后，都明确认识了国营农场的社会主义性质，积极贯彻了“投资少，收效快，收获大，不与民争地”的建场方针，在经营管理方面，初步实行了定额管理，减少了非生产人员；在选种、处理种子、施肥和机务技术等方面也有显著改进。有的农场发展了多种生产，实行合理的作物轮作和农牧结合，使生产不断提高，收入更加稳定。今年不少农场因灾害严重，造成不同程度的损失和亏损，但发展多部门经营和农牧结合较好的晋源、芦台、五里店、双桥和永年等农场仍可保持盈利。
    国营农场对广大农民起了示范作用。全国国营农场主要作物小麦、水稻、大豆和棉花等的单位面积产量，平均都超过农民的产量。如小麦平均产量比全国平均产量高出百分之四十二多，水稻高出百分之二十七多。许多农业生产合作社、互助组和个体农民，在国营农场的影响和帮助下，也改进了技术，提高了生产。
    【新华社哈尔滨十九日电】黑龙江省正在筹建一处占土地一万公顷以上的机械农场。现在这个农场的土地的总体规划设计计划书即将完成。整个农场将在一九五八年全部建成。这个农场建成后，将拥有一个总场部、三个分场部及十一个生产队和一个畜牧场，土地面积可达一万三千一百三十九公顷，畜牧场面积七百公顷，造林五千四百二十五公顷。每年将为国家生产数以万吨计的粮食。
    这个机械农场场地在克山机械农场附近的大片荒原上。这块荒地东西长有三十公里，南北长九公里多，总面积两万六千八百公顷；其中除极少数撂荒地外，其余都是从来没有开垦过的原始荒地；地势平坦，适于机耕作业；土质很好，每年无霜期有一百一十五天，年降雨量有六百公厘左右，很适于农作物的生育，特别是适于栽培小麦和大豆。
