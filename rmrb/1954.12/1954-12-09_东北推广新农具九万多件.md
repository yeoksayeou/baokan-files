    In the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, over 45,000 new-style animal-powered farm tools were promoted this year. Including the new-style animal-powered farm tools promoted in the previous four years, a total of over 90,000 pieces have been promoted. The majority of these are double-wheeled double-share plows, double-wheeled single-share plows, wheel-less single-share plows, and walking plows. The promotion and use of new-style animal-powered farm tools plays a significant role in deep plowing, close planting, and improving other agricultural production techniques. The increased production efficiency is generally very significant. Liaoning Province conducted focused inspections this year. In Yixian, Gaiping, Xinjin, Liaoyang and other counties, the sorghum, soybeans, millet, corn and other crops cultivated with new-style animal-powered farm tools increased production by 20 to 30 percent compared to those cultivated with old farm tools, while wheat increased production by 50 to 100 percent. In Jianchang Village, Chifeng County, Rehe Province, the per-mu yield of sorghum cultivated with new-style animal-powered farm tools increased by 50 percent this year. Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province, promoted the use of new-style animal-powered farm tools on the basis of mutual aid and cooperation. Crops cultivated with the new farm tools increased production by 30 percent. Nearly 900 agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms in the county have promoted a total of 398 sets of new-style animal-powered farm tools, including more than 900 plows. Currently, each cooperative can only average one piece. It is estimated that if each agricultural production cooperative in the county promotes one more plow, approximately 900 pieces can be promoted. If all the wheat in the agricultural production cooperatives and collective farms in the county is cultivated with new-style animal-powered farm tools, with a 30 percent increase in production, over 6 million jin of wheat can be produced in one year. With the development of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, various provinces are continuing to actively promote new-style animal-powered farm tools.

    东北推广新农具九万多件
    辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、热河四省，今年推广使用新式畜力农具达四万五千多件，连前四年推广使用的新式畜力农具计算在内，共已推广九万多件。其中大多数是双轮双铧犁、双轮一铧犁、无轮一铧犁和步犁。新式畜力农具的推广使用，对深耕、密植，及改进其他农业生产技术，都有很大作用，增产效率一般都很显著。辽宁省今年有重点地进行了检查，义县、盖平、新金、辽阳等县用新式畜力农具耕种的高粱、大豆、谷子、苞米等作物，较旧农具耕种的增产百分之二十到三十，小麦增产百分之五十到一倍。热河省赤峰县碱场村，今年用新式畜力农具耕种的土地，每亩高粱增产百分之五十。黑龙江省克山县在互助合作的基础上，推广使用新式畜力农具；用新农具耕种的作物增产百分之三十。全县近九百个农业生产合作社和集体农庄，推广使用的新式畜力农具共三百九十八套，其中犁有九百多件，现在每社只能平均到一件。据估计，全县农业生产合作社如每社再推广犁一件，即可推广九百件左右；如果全县农业生产合作社和集体农庄的小麦，都用新式畜力农具耕种，以增产百分之三十计算，一年即可增产小麦六百多万斤。随着农业互助合作的发展，现在各省正在继续积极推广新式畜力农具。
