Shandong Province purchased more than 626,000 dan of cotton in November, exceeding the monthly plan by 21.49 percent, and 55.25 percent more than the cotton purchased in the same period last year. By November 30, the province had purchased more than 1.26 million dan of cotton.

The Shandong Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued instructions in early November, requiring major cotton and peanut producing areas to focus on doing a good job in the unified purchase of cotton and peanuts, and to combine this with doing a good job in the unified purchase and sale of grain. This instruction reversed the thinking of some cadres in major cotton and peanut producing areas who "emphasized grain and neglected cotton." The Shandong Provincial Finance and Economics Committee also instructed local finance and economics departments to strengthen the business of unified cotton purchase. As a result, the amount of cotton purchased in the province in November increased significantly compared to October. At present, various localities are further strengthening the unified purchase of cotton by conducting in-depth ideological education for cotton farmers. (Our Shandong Reporter Station)

### 山东超额完成上月购棉计划

    山东超额完成上月购棉计划
    山东省十一月份收购棉花六十二万六千多担，超过月计划百分之二十一点四九，比去年同时期棉花收购量多百分之五十五点二五。到十一月三十日，全省已经收购棉花一百二十六万多担。
    中共中央山东分局在十一月上旬曾经发出指示，要求棉花、花生重要产区以做好棉花、花生统购工作为重点，结合做好粮食统购统销工作。这个指示扭转了棉花、花生重点产区部分干部“重粮轻棉”的思想。山东省财政经济委员会也指示各地财经部门加强了棉花统购的业务工作。结果全省十一月份的棉花收购数量比十月份显著增加。目前，各地正在用对棉农深入进行思想教育等办法，进一步加强棉花统购工作。       （本报山东记者站）
