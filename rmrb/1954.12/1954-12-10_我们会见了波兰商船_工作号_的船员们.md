    We Met the Crew of the Polish Merchant Ship "Praca"

    On the morning of October 17th, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe traveled from Gdańsk to the port of Gdynia to perform, where we met the crew of the Polish merchant ship "Praca," who had returned to their homeland after a difficult struggle. They had been hijacked to Taiwan by the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs last October.
    Our car sped along the tree-lined boulevard of the coastal street in what was once the world-famous "Danzig Corridor." Outside the car, the autumn wind swirled fallen leaves, and a drizzle fell. In the distance, the sea was covered in a gray fog, and countless seagulls flapped their wings, all of which made us strongly feel that it was already late autumn.
    After half an hour's drive, we arrived at the port of Gdynia and were settled in a brand-new building on the waterfront. This is the "Seafarer's Home." It is a large hotel built by the Polish government for seafarers after the war. All seafarers returning from ocean voyages can bring their wives and children here to live together for a period of time. The hotel has sickrooms, a library, and a well-equipped club. The seafarers here are just like at home. We met the returning "Praca" crew in the restaurant of this "Seafarer's Home."
    When we saw the crew members, our hearts immediately boiled over. We all rushed forward, not waiting for the host to introduce the crew members to us one by one, and shook hands and greeted them. We visited four crew members. Their names were Lai Adam, Si Edward, Wei Zbiegnev, and Cai Leopold. After a cordial conversation, everyone calmed down and took their seats. Lai Adam excitedly said that he felt extremely honored and happy to be able to meet with comrades from the Chinese People's Liberation Army from faraway Beijing; they had returned from Taiwan in July of this year. Because of their unyielding struggle and the support of the people of the world, they were able to return to their beloved homeland—the People's Republic of Poland. He especially emphasized: "During the more than nine months of detention, our friendship with you has not only not been interrupted, but has become more consolidated and developed. Because the facts more clearly prove that the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are not only the enemies of the Chinese people but also the common enemies of the Polish people and all peace-loving people. If Taiwan is not liberated for one day, all merchant ships sailing on the high seas will not have the guarantee of free navigation." As soon as Lai Adam's words were translated, the applause of the song and dance troupe comrades resounded throughout the restaurant. Then we surrounded several crew members and listened to them talk about the course of the hijacking and their heroic struggle.
    In 1953, after the merchant ship "Praca" was repaired in the port of Antwerp, Belgium, it set sail for Constanța, Romania, on June 13. There, it was loaded with supplies and passed through the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Suez Canal, the Indian Ocean, and the Gulf of Tonkin, entering the East China Sea. The whole way was calm and tranquil. However, on October 4, when the "Praca" was sailing on the high seas more than 100 miles east of Taiwan, two airplanes suddenly appeared and flew towards them, one an American plane and the other a Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang plane. After circling and scouting for a while, three Chiang bandit warships quickly sailed toward the "Praca." When the warships approached the "Praca," more than 80 Chiang bandit soldiers disembarked and forcibly boarded the "Praca," sealing off the ship's radio station. They forced the crew members with guns, ordering the "Praca" to sail along a designated route. The crew members angrily protested against this act of piracy, but the Chiang bandit soldiers had nothing to say in response, only saying that it was an "order" from above.
    After a night of sailing, the "Praca" arrived in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on October 5. The Chiang bandits sent troops to monitor the crew members on the ship, and at the same time forcibly unloaded the supplies on the ship.
    Initially, the Polish crew members were still imprisoned on the ship. Chiang bandit secret agents boarded the ship every day to threaten and lure the crew members, saying, "Whoever is a Communist will be shot! You can never dream of returning to your homeland!" However, the answer these shameless guys received every time was contempt and resistance.
    Five months later, all the Polish crew members were escorted to a school in the Kaohsiung urban area and imprisoned. Here, the Polish crew members waged a more tenacious and brave struggle to win the right to return to their homeland and to defend the right to free navigation on the high seas.
    Under the slogan of "Death rather than not return home," the Polish crew members had launched four hunger strikes, each lasting three days, and the last one lasting four days. They refused any food sent by the Chiang bandit secret agents. The crew members wrote on the walls of the cells where they were detained: "We resolutely oppose the unreasonable detention by the Chiang bandits!" Each time they went on a hunger strike, the Chiang bandit secret agents monitored them even more closely, hoping to discover who were the activists and who were the Communists from the struggle. However, the secret agents' expectations were in vain, because "striving for freedom and returning to the motherland" was the common desire of all the detained Polish crew members. When they were carrying out their third hunger strike, a Chiang bandit gang secret service chief came. The crew members cursed him as a robber and a swindler. The secret service chief became angry with shame and immediately pretended to make a phone call, ordering the bandit soldiers to arrest the Polish crew members who cursed him. However, all the Polish crew members shouted in unison, willing to be taken away together. Seeing the situation was not good, the secret agents did not dare to arrest anyone. On another occasion, secret agents prepared to take away a Polish crew member, and the remaining Polish crew members rushed forward and gave the secret agents who were arresting people two loud slaps.
    With the righteous support of peace-loving people all over the world, the heroic Polish crew members were victorious. On July 15th of this year, they returned to the land of their beloved Polish motherland—Gdańsk.
    Finally, Lai Adam said that in the most difficult days of the "Praca" crew members, they not only received the sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world but also the deep sympathy of the people of Taiwan. When the Polish crew members were on a hunger strike, the Taiwanese people secretly gave a thumbs-up, praising their bravery in the struggle. The masses in Kaohsiung Harbor secretly rowed small boats at night to quietly send them bananas and other food. The Taiwanese people deeply understood who their friends were and what they should do. They had already linked their destiny with the destiny of these Polish crew members who had come from thousands of miles away.
      "We are encouraged by this enthusiasm and bravery of the Taiwanese people." Lai Adam concluded: "The Taiwanese people are waiting for your liberation army. We wish you victory in liberating Taiwan! With such people, the struggle to liberate Taiwan will surely be victorious."
    We once again excitedly shook hands and embraced our Polish friends who had returned in victory and expressed our condolences and gratitude. We told them that we would convey to the Chinese people the high degree of patriotism and internationalism they demonstrated in the struggle against the hijacking of the Polish merchant ship by the Chiang bandit gang.
    Before leaving, Lai Adam also told us: "The liberation of Taiwan is not only the desire of the Chinese people and the Taiwanese people but also the desire of all peace-loving people and the crew members and their families who are still detained by the Chiang bandits! If Taiwan is not liberated for one day, all merchant ships of all countries sailing on the high seas in the Far East will not be guaranteed."

    我们会见了波兰商船“工作号”的船员们
    马楠
    十月十七日上午，我国人民解放军歌舞团由革但斯克前往革丹尼亚海港演出，在那里我们会见了历经艰苦斗争返回祖国的波兰商船“工作号”的船员。他们是去年十月被美国和蒋介石匪帮劫往台湾的。
    我们的汽车在曾经一度闻名世界的所谓“但泽走廊”上沿着海滨街的林荫道飞奔前进，车外秋风卷着落叶，细雨濛濛，远处海面上灰腾腾地笼罩着浓雾，无数海鸥在振翅飞翔，这些都使人强烈地感觉到现在已经是深秋了。
    车行半小时就到了革丹尼亚海港，我们被安置在海滨一所崭新的大楼中。这就是“海员之家”。它是战后波兰政府为海员们修建的一所规模宏大的旅馆，所有远洋航行回来的海员们，都可以把自己的妻子和孩子接到这里，共同生活一个时期。旅馆中有病室、图书馆和设备完善的俱乐部。海员们在这里就跟在自己的家一样。我们就是在这个“海员之家”的餐厅内和归来的“工作号”船员们见面的。
    当我们见到船员们的时候，我们的心马上沸腾起来了，我们都拥上前去，等不及主人把船员们一
  一介绍给我们，就和他们握手问好。我们访问了四位船员。他们的名字叫赖·阿达姆，斯·艾德瓦尔德，维·兹碧格诺夫，蔡·来波尔德。一阵亲切交谈之后，大家才静下来入座。赖·阿达姆首先兴奋、激动地说，他能够和从遥远的北京来的中国人民解放军的同志会见，感到极大的光荣和幸福；他们是今年七月间由台湾归国的。由于他们进行了不屈不挠的斗争，由于全世界人民对他们的声援，他们才能够回到自己亲爱的祖国——波兰人民共和国。他特别着重说：“在被扣押的九个多月当中，我们和你们的友谊不仅没有中断，相反地却更加巩固和发展了。因为事实更清楚地证明：美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮不仅是中国人民的敌人，也是波兰人民和一切爱好和平人民的共同敌人。台湾一天不解放，一切航行在公海上的商船便没有自由航行的保障。”赖·阿达姆的话刚一翻译完，歌舞团同志们的掌声就响遍了整个餐厅。接着我们就把几位船员同志包围起来，听他们谈被劫扣的经过和英勇斗争的情形。
    一九五三年，“工作号”商船在比利时的安特卫普港口修好之后，于六月十三日开往罗马尼亚的康斯坦萨，在那里装满了物资，通过黑海、地中海、苏彝士运河、印度洋、东京湾，而进入东海，这一路都是风平浪静的。但在十月四日当“工作号”航行在距台湾以东一百多英里的公海海面上的时候，突然发现两架飞机向他们飞来，一架是美国飞机，一架是蒋介石匪帮飞机，它们盘旋侦察了一阵之后不久，就有三只蒋匪的军舰快速向“工作号”驶来。当军舰靠近“工作号”时，便有八十多个蒋匪兵下舰，强行登上“工作号”，封闭了船上的无线电台。他们拿枪逼着船上人员，勒令“工作号”向指定的航线开驶。船员们愤怒地抗议他们这种海盗行为，蒋匪兵无话可答，只说这是上面的“命令”。
    经过一夜的航行，十月五日“工作号”到了台湾高雄。蒋匪一面派兵监视船上的船员，一面强将船上的物资卸下。
    起初，波兰船员仍然被囚禁在船上，蒋匪特务分子每天上船来向船员们进行威胁和利诱，他们说：“谁是共产党员就枪毙谁！你们永远休想回你们的祖国！”然而这些无耻的家伙，每一次所得到的回答都是轻蔑和反抗。
    五个月之后，波兰船员全部被押解到高雄市区的一个学校里禁闭起来。在这里，波兰船员们为争取返回自己的祖国，为维护公海自由航行的权利进行了更顽强勇敢的斗争。
    波兰船员们在“不回家就死亡”的口号下，曾先后进行过四次绝食斗争，每次绝食的时间都长达三天，最后一次坚持了四天，他们拒绝了蒋匪特务送来的任何食品。船员们在拘禁他们的牢房墙壁上写着：“我们坚决反对蒋匪的无理扣押！”每一次绝食时，蒋匪特务分子便监视得更严，匪徒们期望从斗争中发现谁是积极分子，谁是共产党员，然而特务们的期望落空了，因为“争取自由，重返祖国”是被扣押的全体波兰船员的共同愿望。当他们进行第三次绝食斗争的时候，蒋匪帮一个特务头子来了，船员们就骂他是强盗、骗子手，这个特务老羞成怒，立刻装腔作势打电话，命令匪兵逮捕骂他的波兰船员。可是，全体波兰船员都齐声吼着愿
  一起被带走。特务们见势不佳，就不敢抓人。又有一次特务准备带走一个波兰船员，其余的波兰船员就一拥而上，给了抓人的特务两个响亮的耳光。
    在全世界爱好和平人民的正义声援下，英勇的波兰船员们胜利了，今年七月十五日，他们回到了亲爱的波兰祖国的土地上——革但斯克。
    最后，赖·阿达姆说，在“工作号”船员们最艰难的日子里，他们不仅得到了全世界爱好和平人民的同情，也得到台湾人民的深切同情。在波兰船员们进行绝食斗争的时候，台湾的老百姓便暗暗竖起大拇指，称赞他们斗争的勇敢。高雄港湾的群众，夜间曾划着小船悄悄地把香蕉及其他食物送给他们。台湾人民深深懂得他们的朋友是谁，他们应该做什么。他们已经把自己的命运和这些来自迢迢万里之外的波兰船员们的命运连结在一起了。
      “我们为台湾人民的这种热情和勇敢而鼓舞了”。赖·阿达姆结论式的说道：“台湾人民在期待着你们的解放大军，我们预祝你们解放台湾的胜利！有这样的人民，解放台湾的斗争就一定会胜利。”
    我们再一次激动地同胜利归来的我们的波兰朋友握手拥抱并致慰问感谢之意。我们告诉他们：我们将把他们在反对蒋匪帮劫扣波兰商船的斗争中所表现的高度爱国主义、国际主义精神转达给中国人民。
    临行，赖·阿达姆还向我们表示：“台湾的解放不仅是中国人民和台湾人民的愿望，也是一切爱好和平人民和还在蒋匪扣留下的船员们及其家属们的愿望！台湾一天不解放，一切航行在远东公海上的各国商船就得不到保障。”
