(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 27th) The Second All-Union Writers' Congress concluded its meeting on the afternoon of December 26th in the Kremlin, Moscow. Pospelov and Suslov, Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, attended the meeting.

    The closing meeting was presided over by Fyodor Gladkov, one of the oldest Russian writers. Tychyna spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the delegates to the Congress, he paid tribute to the foreign guests and, through them, to all progressive writers in the world.

    Tychyna said that at this Congress, we summed up the achievements of our activities over the past twenty years. The past twenty years have been a period of growth and prosperity for Soviet literature, as well as for progressive literature in various countries around the world. The development of progressive literature in great China, the people's democracies, the capitalist countries of Europe and Asia, Latin American countries, the United States, and other countries around the world reflects the great process of unity among all peace-loving forces in the world in the struggle against the threat of a new war. Although the foreign writers participating in this conference have different beliefs, they are united under the great ideals of humanism, peace, and friendship among all peoples.

    The Congress passed a message of greetings to the Central Committee of the CPSU amidst rising enthusiasm. In the message, the Congress assured the Party Central Committee that the army of Soviet intellectuals—writers—united around the Communist Party, is determined to redouble its creative efforts to meet the needs of the people.

    Finally, Gladkov delivered the closing speech, saying: We have extensively discussed various issues in the field of creation. I can say on behalf of all the delegates present that the characteristics of our congress are: a fighting spirit, criticism and self-criticism, and the determination to concentrate all our strength to accomplish the major tasks facing us.

    Further report: The Second All-Union Writers' Congress continued its meetings on the 24th and 25th of December.

    At the meeting on the 24th, Shepilov, editor-in-chief of Pravda, said that it is quite natural that the entire Soviet people and progressive public opinion around the world are paying close attention to the Soviet Writers' Congress. This reflects the great international significance of the creative work carried out by Soviet cultural workers. Soviet literature has now become a powerful source of new strength, from which progressive people in various countries have drawn confidence in the victory of social progress. Shepilov then cited many obvious facts to prove the unprecedented upsurge of the Soviet economy and culture. He emphasized that it is the glorious cause of every writer to participate in the great construction work of the people of the motherland with their own creations.

    Foreign writers who congratulated the Congress on the 24th included: Lebanese writer Muruwi, Mongolian writer Damdinsuron, Iranian writer Nafisi, Yugoslav writer Ma Franičević, Polish writer Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, and Uruguayan writer A Gravina. The Congress also received congratulatory messages from Turkish writer Nâzım Hikmet, Spanish writer J. Rejano, and the editorial department of the Italian magazine "Contemporary".

    The meeting concluded with concluding remarks on the discussion of various reports and supplementary reports.

    On the 25th, the meeting adopted a resolution on Surkov's report "On the Status and Tasks of Soviet Literature" and seven other related supplementary reports, and the meeting also adopted a resolution on Tikhonov's report "On Modern World Progressive Literature". The meeting also passed a resolution on the revision of the Writers' Association's charter and the report of the Credentials Committee, and newly elected a Writers' Association Committee composed of 134 members and a Credentials Committee composed of 29 members.

    In the resolution on Surkov's report and seven supplementary reports, the Congress pointed out that since the First All-Union Writers' Congress, the development of multi-ethnic Soviet literature has been closely linked to the lives of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party, and it has made great creative achievements. By sacredly fulfilling the lofty mission of serving the people, following the method of socialist realism, being faithful to the reality of life, and permeating a high degree of ideological content, Soviet literature has produced many valuable works, making it more substantial. The resolution also pointed out that there are still significant shortcomings in the development of Soviet literature. The resolution stipulates some of the most important tasks currently facing Soviet literature. The resolution points out: The mission of Soviet writers is to fully reflect the heroic deeds and noble moral qualities of the Soviet people. It is the sacred responsibility of writers to raise the banner of struggle for the cause of peace even higher, to work harder to expose the imperialist warmongers, and to do everything possible to enhance the patriotic fighting spirit of the Soviet people and increase their preparedness to give any aggressor a devastating rebuff if necessary. The resolution pointed out that the Writers' Association has fully proven in the past twenty years that it is a creative organization that unites and unites all Soviet writers. The Writers' Association should conduct all its work in the future on the basis of strict adherence to broad democratic principles.

    The resolution on Tikhonov's report adopted by the Congress pointed out that progressive literature around the world has developed in the past twenty years. Many works cherished and close to all progressive humanity have been created. Soviet literature and foreign progressive literature are getting closer and closer. The interests of the future of human culture and the interests of world peace consolidate this friendship of humanist writers, despite their different nationalities, religions and philosophical beliefs, and aesthetic viewpoints. No obstacles can stop the increasing development and prosperity of literature that reflects the beautiful hopes of the people and their desire for peace and freedom. The resolution also pointed out the need for writers who safeguard the cause of peace to frequently exchange creative experiences.

    The resolution welcomes and supports the hope expressed by writers from various countries that a World Writers' Congress will be held in 1955, based on the broad participation of literary workers from various countries united under the slogans of peace and culture. The Congress firmly believes that the strength and prestige of progressive literature, which embodies the desire of people from all countries to stop a new world war, to have life and happiness, and to fully promote the great creativity of mankind, will grow year by year.

    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：第二次全苏作家代表大会二十六日下午在莫斯科克里姆林宫举行闭幕会议。苏联共产党中央委员会书记波斯伯洛夫和苏斯洛夫参加了会议。
    闭幕会议由最年长的俄罗斯作家之一费·格拉德科夫主持。蒂奇纳在会上发言。他以代表大会的代表们的名义向外国来宾并且通过他们向世界所有进步作家致敬。
    蒂奇纳说，在这次代表大会上，我们总结了我们过去二十年的活动的成绩。过去二十年是苏联文学，也是世界各国进步文学成长和繁荣的年代。伟大的中国、各人民民主国家、欧洲和亚洲的资本主义国家、拉丁美洲国家、美国和世界其他国家的进步文学的发展，反映了世界上一切爱好和平的力量团结起来同新战争威胁作斗争的伟大进程。尽管参加这次大会的外国作家们有着不同的信念，但是他们都在人道主义、和平和各国人民的友谊的伟大理想下团结在一起。
    大会在高涨的热情中通过向苏共中央致敬的电文。大会在电文中向党中央保证：团结在共产党周围的苏联知识分子——文学家——的大军，决心在创作方面加倍努力来满足人民的要求。
    最后，格拉德科夫致闭幕词，他说：我们广泛地讨论了创作方面的各种问题。我可以代表所有在场的代表说：我们大会的特点就是：战斗的精神，批评和自我批评以及集中我们的一切力量来完成我们面临的重大任务的决心。
    又讯：第二次全苏作家代表大会二十四日和二十五日继续举行会议。
    在二十四日会议上，真理报总编辑谢皮洛夫发言说，苏联全体人民和全世界进步舆论，都密切注意苏联作家代表大会，这是十分自然的。这反映出了苏联文化工作者所进行的创造性的工作的巨大的国际意义。苏联文学现在已成为强大的新生力量的泉源，各国进步人们从这里汲取了对社会进步的胜利的信心。谢皮洛夫接着引述了许多明显的事实，证明苏联经济和文化空前未有的高涨的情况。他强调指出，用自己的创作参加祖国人民伟大的建设工作是每一个作家的光荣事业。
    二十四日向代表大会祝贺的外国作家有：黎巴嫩作家穆鲁维、蒙古人民共和国作家达木丁苏隆、伊朗作家纳菲西、南斯拉夫作家马·弗朗尼契维奇、波兰作家雅·伊瓦希凯维奇和乌拉圭作家艾·格拉维纳等人。代表大会还接到了土耳其作家纳·希克梅特、西班牙作家胡·雷哈诺和意大利的“当代”杂志的编辑部的贺电。
    会议最后听取了关于各项报告和副报告的讨论的总结发言。
    二十五日，会议就苏尔科夫的“关于苏联文学的现状和任务”的报告和其他七个有关的补充报告通过了一项决议，会议并就吉洪诺夫的“关于现代世界进步文学”的报告通过了一项决议。会议还通过了关于修改作家协会会章和资格审查委员会的报告，并且新选出了由一百三十四人组成的作家协会委员会和由二十九人组成的资格审查委员会。
    大会在关于苏尔科夫的报告和七个补充报告的决议中指出：自从第一次全苏作家代表大会举行以来，多民族的苏维埃文学的发展是和在共产党领导下的苏联人民的生活紧密地联系着的，它已经在创作上取得了巨大成绩。由于神圣地执行着为人民服务的崇高使命，遵循着社会主义现实主义的方法，由于忠实于生活的实际，渗透着高度的思想性，苏维埃文学产生了许多宝贵的作品，使它更加充实了。决议同时指出，在苏联文学的发展中还存在有重大的缺点。决议规定了苏维埃文学当前的一些最重大的任务。决议指出：苏联作家的使命是充分反映苏联人民的英雄事迹和崇高的道德品质。作家的神圣责任就是更高地举起为和平事业而奋斗的旗帜，更加努力地去揭露帝国主义战争贩子，用一切办法来提高苏联人民的爱国主义的战斗精神，提高他们在一旦必要时给任何侵略者以毁灭性的反击的准备。决议指出，作家协会在过去二十年中完全证明了它是一个联合和团结所有苏联作家的创作组织。作家协会今后应该在严格遵守广泛民主原则的基础上进行一切工作。
    大会通过的关于吉洪诺夫的报告的决议指出，在过去二十年中，全世界的进步文学有了发展。许多为全体进步人类所珍视和亲近的作品已经创造出来。苏联文学和外国的进步文学日益接近。人类文化前途的利益和世界和平的利益巩固着人道主义作家的这种友谊，尽管他们的国籍、宗教和哲学信仰以及审美观点不同。任何障碍都拦阻不了反映人民的美好希望和他们要和平和要自由的愿望的文学日益发展和繁荣。决议还指出了维护和平事业的作家之间经常交流创作经验的必要性。
    决议欢迎并支持各国作家提出的这样的希望：在团结在和平和文化口号下的各国文学工作者广泛参加的基础上，在一九五五年举行世界作家代表大会。代表大会坚决相信，体现着各国人民要求制止新的世界大战、要求生活和幸福、要求充分发扬人类的伟大创造性的愿望的进步文学的力量和威望将一年年地增长。
