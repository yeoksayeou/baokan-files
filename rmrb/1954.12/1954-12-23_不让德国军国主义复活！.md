Don't Let German Militarism Revive!
Soviet Cultural Figures' Appeal to the French People

    The "Literary Gazette" of the 21st published the opinions of famous Soviet cultural figures on the upcoming vote in the French National Assembly on the Paris Agreements under the title "Don't Let German Militarism Revive!"

    The poet Konstantin Simonov asked: Will France become a country of the Petain era, a country ruled by those who sold their swords, their people, their history, their past, present and future, or will it remain a country capable of independence, capable of inheriting the great ideals of the Resistance, and daring to say "no" to the plan to establish a new Wehrmacht? Simonov pointed out: This is the choice facing those who will vote for or against the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

    The famous film director Sergei Gerasimov said: At this moment, it is necessary to once again remind millions of French people of the dangers to them of the policy of reviving German militarism. We believe that the French people will speak out: advocating peace and friendship, and safeguarding the bright prospects of the peaceful alliance between our two peoples.

    The famous children's literature writer Samuil Marshak said: The Soviet state and all the Soviet people are peace-loving. Now, when some people are trying to drag France into an aggressive military bloc that is clearly against us and against its allies by means of intimidation and deception, we say to the French: You still have time to understand where they are leading you.

    Professor Ivan Anisimov, a famous literary researcher, emphasized: The Franco-Soviet Treaty of 1944 was forged with the blood of the people of France and the Soviet Union. We must cherish the Franco-Soviet Treaty – a guarantee of peace and life.

    Sergei Yutkevich, the film director who played in the film "Liberated France," also mentioned the great historical significance of the Franco-Soviet Treaty, and pointed out: Consolidating Franco-Soviet friendship will be a guarantee that the disasters of war will not be repeated. But ratifying the Paris Agreements would erase the Franco-Soviet Treaty.

    The poet Vladimir Lugovskoy enthusiastically called on French friends to oppose the Paris Agreements. He emphasized: German militarism always begins by shouting "Eastward," but suddenly it hits France.

The Polish Parliament Calls on the French Parliament to Reject the Paris Agreements

    Jan Dąbrowski, Speaker of the Parliament of the Polish People's Republic, sent a telegram to André Le Troquer, Speaker of the French National Assembly, calling on the French National Assembly to reject the Paris Agreements.

    The telegram pointed out: It was not too long ago that the Hitlerite aggressors ravaged Poland and France. Countless Poles and Frenchmen were buried in the furnaces of concentration camps. The youth, soldiers, and guerrillas of Poland and France fought side by side in the Second World War, fighting a common enemy. They were deeply convinced at the time that only by eradicating German militarism could the people of the two countries be guaranteed a lasting peace.

    The telegram said: Ratification of the Paris Agreements would preclude the possibility of a unified Germany, worsen the situation in Europe, intensify the expansion of armaments, bring the threat of a new war ever closer, and, moreover, armed German militarism would threaten not only Poland but also the independence of France.

    The telegram concluded: It is hoped that the French National Assembly will take into account the future of Europe when making its decision, because the fate of France itself is closely related to the fate of Europe.

French People Hold Demonstrations and Strikes Against the Paris Agreements

    On December 20, the first day of the debate on the London and Paris Agreements in the French National Assembly, hundreds of delegations of French working people from all over France visited the National Assembly one after another. They represented the French people in resolutely demanding that the deputies reject the new plan to re-militarize West Germany and vote against the ratification of the London and Paris Agreements.

    Many policemen wearing gas masks surrounded the National Assembly to block the demonstrations of the French people. As a result, many people who came to meet with deputies were blocked from entering. After insisting for three hours, the masses were still shouting: "Let us in, let us in!"

    "l'Humanité" reported that some factories in the Paris area held short strikes on the 20th to protest the plan to arm the Bonn revanchists. Similar strikes were held in Lyon, Nice and other cities.

    The French National Peace Council issued a statement saying that in the past two months, in sixty-seven provinces in France, approximately 3.5 million people had signed protest letters against the militarization of West Germany.

Mass Rallies Held in Major Italian Cities

    The people of Italy with progressive ideas are strengthening the struggle against the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

    An editorial in "l'Unità" pointed out: Parliament has never encountered such a complex and difficult problem. The independence and existence of our motherland are in danger. People are saying the most important "agree" or "disagree" of their lives.

    Former Prime Minister Ferruccio Parri published an article in "People's Unity" (organ of the People's Unity Movement), denouncing the Western European Union and supporting the proposal to hold negotiations with the Soviet Union. Parri emphasized that ratification of the Paris Agreements would worsen the international situation. He demanded that negotiations be held immediately to resolve outstanding issues.

    The Italian National Peace Council organized large and small mass rallies in major towns and cities across the country on the 19th to protest the ratification of the Paris Agreements. Leaders of the peace movement and democratic parties participated in these rallies.

The Plan to Arm West Germany Causes Unease Among the Swiss People

    Swiss progressive newspapers report that the plan to arm West Germany has caused great unease among all strata of the Swiss people.

    Famous Swiss scientists Bonner and Barth have issued statements against the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

    The magazine "Contact," which began publication in Lausanne in October - a mouthpiece for people of different political and religious beliefs - opposes the ratification of the Paris Agreements and advocates arms reduction. One article is entitled "A Serious Threat to Switzerland." This article says: "We share a 500-kilometer border with Germany. If the London and Paris Agreements take effect, then 500,000 German troops with aircraft, tanks and a General Staff composed of former Hitlerite generals will be permanently stationed near our border. Arming West Germany endangers our lives, sovereignty and even the existence of Switzerland. Only the establishment of a collective security system in Europe can truly guarantee the independence and prosperity of Switzerland."

### 不让德国军国主义复活！

    不让德国军国主义复活！
    苏联文化界人士向法国人民发出的号召
    二十一日的“文学报”在“不让德国军国主义复活！”这个标题下刊载了苏联文化界著名人士关于法国国民议会即将表决巴黎协定一事的意见。
    诗人康·西蒙诺夫问道：法国要成为一个贝当时代的国家，成为一个为那些出卖自己的宝剑、自己的人民、自己的历史、自己的过去、现在和将来的人所统治的国家呢，还是仍然作一个能够独立，能够继承抵抗运动者的伟大理想，敢于对建立新国防军的计划说个“不”字的国家呢？西蒙诺夫指出：这就是那些将投票赞成或者反对批准巴黎协定的人所面临的抉择。
    著名的电影导演谢·格拉西莫夫说：在这个时刻，必须再一次提醒千百万法国人，复活德国军国主义的政策对他们有怎么样的危险。我们相信，法国人民会说出自己的话来：主张和平和友谊，维护我们两国人民和平同盟的光辉前景。
    著名的儿童文学作家萨·马尔夏克说：苏维埃国家和全体苏联人民是爱好和平的。现在，正当有人想用恫吓和欺骗的方法把法国拖入显然是反对我们，反对它的同盟者的侵略性军事集团的时候，我们对法国人说：你们还来得及明白：他们在把你们引向什么地方。
    著名的文学研究者伊凡·阿尼西莫夫教授着重指出：一九四四年的法苏条约是法、苏两国人民的鲜血凝结成的。必须珍重法苏条约——和平和生活的保证。
    影片“解放了的法兰西”的演出者、电影导演谢尔盖·尤特凯维奇也提到法苏条约的伟大的历史意义，并且指出：巩固法苏友谊将是使战争的灾祸不再重演的保证。但是批准巴黎协定就会勾销法苏条约。
    诗人弗拉吉米尔·鲁戈夫斯科伊热烈地号召法国朋友反对巴黎协定。他着重指出：德国军国主义总是以大叫“东进”开始，而一下子却打到法国。
    波兰议会呼吁法国议会拒绝批准巴黎协定
    波兰人民共和国议会议长扬·邓博夫斯基致电法国国民议会议长勒特罗盖，呼吁法国国民议会拒绝巴黎协定。
    电文指出：希特勒侵略者蹂躏波兰和法国，还不是太久以前的事。无数波兰人和法国人葬身在火葬场的炉子里。波兰和法国的青年、士兵以及游击队员在第二次世界大战中曾经并肩作战，打击过共同的敌人。他们当时深深相信，只有根绝德国军国主义，才能保证两国人民获得巩固的和平。
    电文说：批准巴黎协定就会排除统一德国的可能性，使欧洲局势恶化，加紧军备的扩张，使新战争威胁日益迫近，而且，武装起来的德国军国主义不仅将威胁波兰、而且也将威胁法国的独立。
    电文最后表示：希望法国国民议会在作出决议时，考虑到欧洲的前途，因为法国本身的命运和欧洲的命运是息息相关的。
    法国人民举行示威和罢工反对巴黎协定
    十二月二十日，法国国民议会举行关于伦敦和巴黎协定的辩论的第一天，从法国各地来到巴黎的好几百个法国劳动人民代表团络绎不绝地访问国民议会。他们代表法国人民坚决要求议员们拒绝使西德重新军国主义化的新计划，投票反对批准伦敦和巴黎协定。
    许多警察带着防毒面具把国民议会包围了起来，以阻挡法国人民的示威。因此，很多来会见议员的人都被拦在门外不得进去。坚持三个小时后，群众还在高喊：“让我们进去，让我们进去！”
    “人道报”报道，巴黎地区的一些工厂二十日举行了短时间的罢工，抗议武装波恩复仇主义者的计划。里昂、尼斯和其他城市也举行了类似的罢工。
    法国全国和平理事会发表声明说，在过去两个月中，在法国的六十七个省中，约有三百五十万人在反对西德军国主义化的抗议书上签了名。
    意大利各主要城市举行群众集会
    意大利的具有进步思想的人民正在加强反对批准巴黎协定的斗争。
      “团结报”社论指出：议会从来没有遇到过这样复杂而又困难的问题。我们祖国的独立和存在都处在危险中。人们正在说出他们一生中最具重要意义的“同意”或“不同意”这几个字。
    前总理费鲁乔·帕里在“人民统一报”（人民统一运动机关报）上发表一篇文章，斥责西欧联盟，并拥护同苏联举行谈判的主张。帕里着重说明批准巴黎协定将使国际局势趋于恶化。他要求立刻举行谈判来解决悬而未决的问题。
    意大利全国和平理事会十九日在全国各主要城镇组织了抗议批准巴黎协定的大、小群众集会。和平运动和民主党派的领袖们参加了这些集会。
    武装西德的计划引起瑞士人民的不安
    瑞士进步报纸报道，武装西德的计划在瑞士各阶层人民中间引起很大的不安。
    瑞士著名科学家邦纳和巴特发表了反对批准巴黎协定的声明。
    十月间在洛桑开始发行的刊物“联系”——这是具有不同政治和宗教信仰的人们的喉舌——反对批准巴黎协定，主张裁减军备。其中一篇文章的标题是“对瑞士的严重威胁”。这篇文章说：“我们和德国共有长达五百公里的疆界。如果伦敦和巴黎协定生效，那么拥有飞机、坦克和一个由前希特勒将军们所组成的参谋总部的五十万德国军队将经常驻扎在我们的国界附近。武装西德危及我们的生命、主权以至瑞士的存在。只有在欧洲建立一个集体安全体系，才能使瑞士的独立和繁荣得到真正保证。”
