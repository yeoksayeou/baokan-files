    The issue of the technical innovation movement has been discussed repeatedly in this newspaper. In order to correctly continue this movement, we would like to discuss it again.
    First, let us raise a question: In China's socialist industrial construction and industrial production, what is the main problem or main link at present?
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, there was a period when the feudal, reactionary remnant systems and remnant elements hindered the development of our industrial production. Under such circumstances, we carried out a large-scale democratic reform movement, relying on the masses to eliminate these feudal, reactionary remnant systems and remnant elements. In the democratic reform movement, the level of awareness of the workers greatly improved, and the working class's sense of responsibility as masters of the production cause was basically established, thus promoting the widespread development of labor emulation. On the basis of democratic reform and mass labor emulation, various industries and enterprises gradually established a number of management systems in line with socialist enterprises, especially the beginning of the implementation of planned management. That is to say, a socialist production order has been established in factories and mines, and the main obstacle to our progress is no longer this aspect, although many problems still exist in this regard.
    The main problem hindering our progress today is technical backwardness. Of course, this problem cannot be solved in a few years; solving it is a task for a historical period.
    In terms of production equipment, the equipment of our original factories and mines is backward. These factories and mines still have great potential production capacity. Within the first five-year plan, the completion of industrial production tasks mainly relies on these enterprises. So how should we improve these backward equipment, give full play to its potential, and use these old equipment to produce new products and products of higher quality? This is mainly a technical issue, namely the issue of technical innovation.
    In terms of the production technology of workers and technicians, the level is also very low. We have not yet mastered many modern production technologies. We have not yet learned to use and maintain many new equipment supplied by the Soviet Union. Some new equipment has even been damaged because we do not know how to use and maintain it. We are not able to use many technical materials and drawings provided by the Soviet Union. This state of backward production technology is becoming increasingly acute due to the increase in the speed of industrial development, the establishment of new industries (which we have not had in the past), and the continuous increase in new workers. Generally speaking, in the democratic reforms and labor emulations of the past few years, the labor attitude and labor discipline of the working class have undergone fundamental changes. The ranks of the Chinese working class are politically strong. Technical backwardness is currently the most important weakness of the Chinese working class. Without overcoming this weakness, the working class cannot smoothly undertake the great historical task of socialist construction. We must overcome this weakness, and we will certainly be able to overcome it. The way to overcome this weakness is to carry out a mass movement of learning technology, improving technology, and raising technology, to carry out a mass technical innovation movement, and to guide labor emulation in a direction with technical innovation as the main content or main method.
    In terms of technical management, we are also backward, even chaotic. Our technical and economic indicators are generally backward, and the relevant technical regulations and systems are quite chaotic. Improving technical management will be more effective on the basis of improving technical equipment and improving the technical level of the workers, that is, on the basis of technical innovation. At the same time, improving technical management itself is also a technical innovation.
    In summary, we can say that technical innovation is a general requirement and general direction of China's industrial production in the current period.
    Then how can we achieve technical innovation?
    Technical innovation is the improvement and upgrading of production equipment, production tools, technical processes, technical standards, operating methods, and working conditions. It can also be said to be the improvement and upgrading of production equipment, operating technology, and technical management. To achieve the above-mentioned improvements and upgrades, we must: first, learn advanced Soviet technology, which is the most important and most basic way for us to innovate technology; second, promote our country's existing advanced experience; third, solicit rationalization proposals for key issues in production. And these methods must be seriously developed on the basis of strengthening mass technical education and improving the technical level of the masses.
    Since the technical innovation movement has been carried out in various places, although many deviations have occurred, these deviations did not occur because technical innovation itself is wrong, but because of shortcomings in leadership. The editorial of this newspaper on September 18 made a more detailed discussion on the issue of deviations in the technical innovation movement, which will not be repeated here. Here, we will focus on how to correctly continue the technical innovation movement.
    Since the technical innovation movement has been carried out in various places, many factories and mines have achieved remarkable results. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel Company is the enterprise that started the technical innovation movement earliest. In the first half of this year, it promoted 256 kinds of advanced experience with decisive significance, including 65 kinds of learning from the Soviet Union, 32 kinds of learning from other regions, and adopted 159 kinds of rationalization proposals put forward by the enterprise. For example, a factory in Chongqing decided to scrap 136 belt lathes that were scrapped in the process of product finalization. After reconstruction, they were put into production again, saving the country 15 billion yuan. For example, Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, Yumen Oil Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine, Heilongjiang Thermal Power Third Engineering Company, Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill, Shandong Pharmaceutical Factory, Shenyang Rubber Seven Factory... and many other factories and mines have achieved remarkable results in technical innovation. Some of them have improved production equipment and production tools, some have improved technical processes, some have improved operating methods, and some have solved long-standing labor protection problems. According to the experience of these factories and mines, the following issues must be paid attention to in the technical innovation movement.
    First, the administrative departments and trade union organizations of various enterprises should, under the unified leadership of the Party, combine with the production tasks and specific conditions of their enterprises to study the methods of further carrying out the technical innovation movement, strengthen the leadership of the technical innovation movement, and must earnestly solve the various difficulties in the technical innovation movement, and must earnestly summarize the existing experiences and lessons.
    Second, the technical innovation movement must have a clear purpose. The purpose of the technical innovation movement is to further promote the mass labor emulation, strengthen the technical management of enterprises, effectively improve labor productivity, and comprehensively complete and overfulfill the various indicators of the national plan. All practices that blindly advocate innovation away from the needs of actual production should be corrected. Various industries and enterprises must, according to their specific circumstances, around the requirements of the production plan, promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union or our country, and put forward topics to mobilize the masses and concentrate the wisdom of the masses to answer these topics. In newly built factories and mines, we should attach great importance to learning and mastering new technologies, and give full play to and utilize the capabilities of new technical equipment.
    Third, the technical innovation movement must have a broad mass character. "Technical Innovation Movement" is a general slogan for improving technology, raising technology, learning and mastering new technology. Therefore, the development of the technical innovation movement should not only attach importance to the initiatives of innovators, organize mass rationalization proposals, but more importantly, organize the masses to learn advanced Soviet experience and promote our country's existing advanced experience, so that advanced experience can be mastered by the broad masses. At the same time, we must also attach importance to the technical education of new workers and generally improve the technical level of the workers. In this way, the technical innovation movement can truly have a broad mass character.
    Fourth, we must strengthen the organizational leadership of the technical innovation movement. The purpose of technical innovation is to improve labor productivity, to constantly eliminate weak links and backward phenomena in production, so as to comprehensively complete the national plan. Weak links and backward phenomena in production exist relatively no matter how high the production level is. This determines that the technical innovation movement cannot be a blitz movement but a regular movement. Therefore, the administrative departments of enterprises should establish and improve technical leadership institutions, improve technical management work, improve institutions responsible for rationalization proposals - compiling topics, reviewing and approving, organizing experiments, conducting rewards, etc., and implement the "Provisional Regulations on Rewards for Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production" promulgated by the Government Administration Council. Trade union organizations must vigorously organize the masses to learn technology, learn advanced Soviet experience, establish and improve mass rationalization proposal committees, strengthen the leadership of production meetings, organize the masses to discuss and study around the topics proposed by the enterprise administration, solicit rationalization proposals, and assist the administration to earnestly promote various advanced experiences.
    Labor emulation is a basic method for building socialism, and the development and improvement of labor emulation has a significant impact on the progress of China's socialist industrialization. The development and improvement of labor emulation is not only determined by the working class's labor attitude, labor discipline, and labor intensity, but also determined by the working class's learning and progress in technology. Therefore, technical innovation must continue to develop, and must become a regular, lasting, and mass movement.

### 必须把技术革新运动继续开展下去

    必须把技术革新运动继续开展下去
    关于技术革新运动的问题，本报已屡次有所论述。为了把这一运动正确地继续开展下去，我们愿意再一次加以论述。
    首先，让我们提出一个问题，即：在我国社会主义的工业建设和工业生产中，当前的主要问题或主要环节是什么？
    在中华人民共和国成立之后，曾经有过一个时期，封建的、反动的残余制度和残余分子，阻碍着我们工业生产的发展。在这样的情况下，我们曾经进行了大规模的民主改革运动，依靠群众，扫除了这些封建的、反动的残余制度和残余分子。在民主改革运动中，职工群众的觉悟程度有了极大的提高，职工群众对于生产事业的主人翁的负责态度基本上树立起来了，从而劳动竞赛有了广泛的发展。在民主改革和群众性的劳动竞赛的基础上，各产业和各企业都逐步建立了一些符合于社会主义企业的管理制度，特别是开始实行了计划管理。这就是说在厂矿企业中，社会主义的生产秩序已经建立起来了，妨碍我们前进的主要的已经不是这一方面的问题了，虽然在这一方面依然存在着许多问题。
    今天妨碍我们前进的主要问题，是技术上的落后。当然，这一问题决不是几年之内可以解决的，解决这一问题是一个历史时期的任务。
    从生产设备方面来说，我们原有厂矿的设备是落后的。这一部分厂矿，还存在着很大的潜在的生产力量。在第一个五年计划之内，工业生产任务的完成，还主要是依靠这些企业。那么该如何改进这些落后的设备，充分发挥它的潜在力量，并利用这些旧设备来生产新产品，生产质量更高的产品呢？这主要是一个技术问题，即技术革新的问题。
    从工人和技术人员的生产技术来说，水平也是很低的。许多现代生产技术我们还没有掌握，苏联已经供应我们的许多新设备，我们还没有学会使用和维修，甚至有些新设备由于我们不会使用和维修而遭受到损坏；苏联供给我们的许多技术资料和图纸，我们还不会运用。这种生产技术落后的状况，由于工业发展速度的增长、由于新的（我们过去没有过的）工业的建立、由于新工人的不断增多而表现得日益尖锐。一般地说，在过去几年的民主改革和劳动竞赛中，职工群众的劳动态度和劳动纪律已经有了根本的变化。我国工人阶级的队伍在政治上是坚强的。生产技术上的落后，是我国工人阶级目前最主要的弱点。不克服这个弱点，工人阶级就不能够顺利地担负起社会主义建设这个伟大的历史任务。我们必须克服这个弱点，我们也一定能够克服这个弱点。克服这个弱点的办法就是开展一个学习技术、改进技术、提高技术的群众性的运动，就是开展一个群众性的技术革新运动，就是把劳动竞赛引导到以技术革新为主要内容或主要方法的方向上来。
    从技术管理方面来说，我们也是落后的，甚至是混乱的。我们的技术经济指标一般是落后的，有关技术的规程、制度是相当混乱的。改进技术管理工作，要在改进技术设备、提高职工群众技术水平的基础上即在技术革新的基础上才更加有效，同时，改进技术管理本身，也是技术上的革新。
    综上所述，我们可以说：技术革新是目前时期我国工业生产中的一个总要求和总方向。
    那么怎样才能达到技术上的革新呢？
    技术革新，就是在生产设备、生产工具、技术过程、技术标准、操作方法和劳动条件等方面的改进和提高，也可以说是生产设备、操作技术和技术管理等方面的改进和提高。要达到上述这些方面的改进和提高，就必须：第一，学习苏联的先进技术，这是我们革新技术的最主要最基本的道路；第二，推广我国已有的先进经验；第三，针对生产中的关键问题，征集合理化建议。而这些办法，又都必须在加强群众的技术教育、提高群众技术水平的基础上才能认真发展起来。
    技术革新运动在各地开展以来，虽然发生了很多偏向，可是这些偏向的发生并不是因为技术革新本身是错误的，而是由于领导上的缺点而产生的。关于技术革新运动中的偏向问题，本报九月十八日的社论中曾做过比较详细的论述，这里不再重复了。这里着重谈一下如何正确地继续开展技术革新运动的问题。
    技术革新运动在各地开展以来，有许多厂、矿企业取得了显著的成绩。如鞍山钢铁公司是技术革新运动开展最早的企业，它在今年上半年推广了有决定意义的先进经验二百五十六种，其中包括学习苏联的六十五种，学习别的地区的三十二种，采纳了本企业提出的合理化建议一百五十九种。又如重庆某厂在产品定型过程中决定报废的皮带车床一百三十六台，经过改造又投入生产，为国家节约了资金一百五十亿元。再如上海机床厂、玉门油矿、萍乡煤矿、黑龙江火电第三工程公司、北京清河制呢厂、山东药厂、沈阳橡胶七厂……等很多厂矿企业，技术革新的成绩都是很显著的。它们有的是改进了生产设备和生产工具，有的是改进了技术过程，有的是改进了操作方法，有的是解决了长期没有解决的劳动保护问题。根据上述这些厂矿企业的经验，在技术革新运动中必须注意以下几个问题。
    第一，各企业行政方面和工会组织，应在党的统一领导下，结合本企业的生产任务和具体情况，研究进一步开展技术革新运动的办法，加强对于技术革新运动的领导，对技术革新运动中的各种困难必须认真地加以解决，对于已有的经验教训必须认真地加以总结。
    第二，必须使技术革新运动具有明确的目的性。技术革新运动的目的在于把群众性的劳动竞赛向前推进一步，加强企业的技术管理，有效地提高劳动生产率，全面地完成和超额完成国家计划的各项指标。一切离开实际生产需要的目标而盲目提倡革新的做法都是应该加以纠正的。各个产业和企业，必须根据自己的具体情况，围绕生产计划的要求，推广苏联的或我国已有的先进经验，并提出课题，发动群众，集中群众的智慧来解答这些课题。在新建的厂矿中，应十分重视学习和掌握新的技术，充分发挥和利用新的技术设备能力。
    第三，必须使技术革新运动具有广泛的群众性。“技术革新运动”是一个改进技术、提高技术、学习和掌握新技术的概括性的口号。所以技术革新运动的开展，不仅应该重视革新者的创举，组织群众性的合理化建议，更重要的是组织群众学习苏联先进经验、推广我国已有的先进经验，使先进经验为广大群众所掌握。同时，还必须重视新工人的技术教育，普遍地提高职工群众的技术水平。这样，技术革新运动才能真正具有广泛的群众性。
    第四，必须加强技术革新运动的组织领导。技术革新的目的是为了提高劳动生产率，为了不断地消灭生产中的薄弱环节和落后现象，以全面地完成国家计划。生产中的薄弱环节和落后现象无论生产水平怎样提高，都是相对地存在的。这就决定了技术革新运动不能是一个突击运动而是经常的运动。因此，企业行政方面应当建立和健全技术领导的机构，改进技术管理工作，健全负责合理化建议工作的机构——编制课题、审查批准、组织试验、进行奖励等工作，贯彻政务院颁布的“有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例”。工会组织必须大力组织群众学习技术、学习苏联先进经验，建立和健全群众合理化建议委员会，加强对生产会议的领导，围绕企业行政提出的课题，组织群众讨论、研究，征集合理化建议，协助行政认真推广各种先进经验。
    劳动竞赛是建设社会主义的基本方法，劳动竞赛的发展和提高，对于我国社会主义工业化的进度有着重大的影响。而劳动竞赛的发展和提高，不仅仅决定于工人阶级的劳动态度、劳动纪律、劳动强度，而且决定于工人阶级在技术上的学习和进步。所以技术革新必须继续发展下去，必须成为一个经常的、持久的、群众性的运动。
