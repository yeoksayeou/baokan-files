    Oppose the Hooligan Behavior of Teasing Female Shop Assistants
    To the Editor:
    I am a staff member of a state-owned commercial department. In my daily work, I often find some customers with hooligan tendencies intentionally engaging in hooligan behavior toward the female shop assistants in state-owned stores. In a retail department of the Haicheng County Department Store in Liaoning Province, the following exasperating things have happened: Some male customers treat female shop assistants with a very unserious attitude. Sometimes, when they want to buy soap, they deliberately ask the female shop assistants, "How much does the 'wife's elder sister' cost, and how much does the 'wife's younger sister' cost?" They don't intend to buy sanitary napkins, but they insist on asking, "What is this thing?" The female shop assistant says, "This is a sanitary napkin." Then they ask, "What is it used for?" The female shop assistant has no choice but to answer, "This is for women, men don't need it." But then they ask, "Why are women allowed to use it, but men are not?" In this case, the female shop assistant has to answer that it is because of the physiological characteristics of women. They further ask what exactly the characteristics are, leaving the female shop assistant speechless. The shop assistants who treat customers in this way are all comrades with good service attitudes. If they encounter comrades with poor attitudes, they will argue with the customers, and then they will raise opinions saying that the shop assistants do not have the idea of serving the people! When we encounter this kind of situation, our leaders have no choice but to educate the shop assistants to overcome difficulties and not to bow to difficulties.
    Some comrades can correctly recognize that this is the bad behavior of a few people insulting national staff. Although they are very angry, they can still work actively. Some comrades cannot correctly criticize this phenomenon and feel that their work is "hopeless" and that "standing at the counter is demeaning," so they are not at ease in their work. This is a problem that deserves attention. We should fight against this hooligan behavior that insults commercial staff.

    反对戏弄女营业员的流氓行为编辑同志：
    我是国营商业部门的一个工作人员。在日常工作中，经常发现有些流氓作风的顾客有意和国营商店的女营业员耍弄流氓行为。在辽宁省海城县百货公司的一个门市部里发生过这样一些令人气愤的事情：有的少数男顾客对待女营业员态度很不严肃，有时他们要买香皂，就故意问女营业员：“大姨子卖多少钱，小姨子怎么卖？”他们本来不买月经带，偏要问：“这是什么东西？”女营业员同志说：“这是月经带。”他又问：“是做什么用的？”女营业员只好回答：“这是妇女用的，你们男同志用不着”；可是他们又问：“为什么许女的用不许男的用？”这样，女营业员只好答复他们说这是因为妇女生理上的特点。他们又进一步问究竟特点在那里，弄的女营业员无言可答。像这样对待顾客的营业员都是服务态度很好的同志。如果遇见态度不好的同志，就要和顾客吵起来，那时他们就要提出意见说营业员没有为人民服务的思想了！遇见这种情况我们领导上就只好教育营业员要克服困难，不要向困难低头。
    有的同志能够正确地认识这是少数人侮辱国家工作人员的坏作风，她们虽然很气愤，但仍能积极工作。有的同志不能正确批判这种现象，就觉得自己的工作“没有出息”，“站柜台，小三辈”，于是就不安心工作。这是一个值得注意的问题，我们应该向这种侮辱商业工作人员的流氓作风作斗争。
