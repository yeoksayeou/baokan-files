Sichuan Province is Manufacturing Large Quantities of New-Style Farm Tools

Under the principle of "manufacturing locally and supplying locally," eight factories in Sichuan Province, distributed in western Sichuan, southern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, and northern Sichuan, including Chengdu Machinery Factory, Southwest Farm Tool Factory, Nanchong Iron Factory, Luzhou Iron Factory, and Chongqing Iron Factory, began manufacturing large quantities of new-style farm tools in October. It is estimated that 3,835 new-style farm tools of various types, such as double-wheeled double-share plows, double-wheeled single-share plows, new-style walking plows, and rollers, will be manufactured within the year. Farmers in Jiangbei, Pixian, Wenjiang, Nanchong, and other places have written letters to the factory workers, expressing their determination to respond to the worker brothers with actions to increase grain production and support industrial construction.
