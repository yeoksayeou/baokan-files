Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 25th: TASS reports that "Pravda" published an article by "Observer" on the 24th, titled "Adventurers' Plan."

    The article states that the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Group Council in Paris has attracted the attention of world public opinion. The decision made at the meeting to formulate a plan for atomic warfare has naturally caused shock to the people of various countries, especially those in Western European countries with smaller territories, denser populations, and concentrated industries.

    The communiqué issued after the meeting exhausted all means to prevent this decision from attracting the attention of readers unfamiliar with cunning diplomatic language. The article points out that, as the saying goes, nothing is secret that will not be known. Even before the communiqué was published, bourgeois newspapers in the United States, Britain, France, and other countries had reported to the world that the North Atlantic Group Council was busy formulating plans to prepare for atomic warfare. These news reports were quickly confirmed by representatives attending the Council meeting. Spaak, Dulles, and Eden said after the meeting that the North Atlantic aggressive group council had indeed passed a resolution to accelerate preparations for war in Europe based on the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons. In order to justify this sinful decision in the eyes of the public, observers and commentators, certainly instructed by representatives attending the meeting, attempted to prove that the use of these weapons at the beginning of the war was appropriate, and even necessary.

    The article says that the North Atlantic Group Council has authorized the United States to decide whether or not atomic or hydrogen weapons should be used.

    The article concludes by stating that the facts show that the aggressive groups of the United States, Britain, and France are embarking on the road to atomic war. The Soviet people cannot ignore these facts. They are closely watching all the conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors in order to take all necessary steps to defeat these plans in a timely manner.

    There is no doubt that the broad masses of people in various countries, especially the broad masses of people in Western Europe who are destined to suffer once an atomic war breaks out, will stand up and strongly protest against these sinful plans to prepare for atomic war.

    冒险主义者的计划
    ——“真理报”刊载的观察家的文章的摘要
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”二十四日刊载了“观察家”写的一篇文章，题目是“冒险主义者的计划”。
    文章说，最近在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议引起了世界公众的注意。会上作出的拟订原子战争计划的决定，很自然地引起了各国极其广泛的人民的震惊，特别是那些领土较小，人口稠密和工业集中的西欧各国的人民。
    会议后发表的公报用尽一切办法想使这个决定不致引起不熟悉狡猾的外交辞令的读者的注意。文章指出，俗语说得好，若要人不知，除非己莫为。甚至在公报发表以前，美国、英国、法国和其他国家的资产阶级报纸就已经纷纷向全世界报道，北大西洋集团理事会正在忙于拟订准备原子战争的计划。这些报纸的消息很快地得到了出席理事会会议的代表的证实。斯巴克、杜勒斯和艾登在会后说，北大西洋侵略集团理事会的确通过了一项决定，要在使用原子武器和氢武器的基础上加速进行在欧洲的备战活动。为了要在公众面前辩解这个罪恶决定，肯定是受到出席会议的代表授意的观察家和评论员们企图证明在战争一开始时就使用这些武器是适宜的，甚至是必要的。
    文章说，北大西洋集团理事会已经授权美国来决定是否应当使用原子武器或者氢武器。
    文章最后说，事实表明，美国、英国、法国的侵略集团正在踏上原子战争的道路，苏联人民对这些事实不能置之不顾。他们正密切注视着帝国主义侵略者的一切阴谋诡计，以便采取一切必要的步骤来及时击败这些计划。
    毫无疑问，各国广大的人民，首先是那些一旦原子战争爆发注定会遭殃的西欧广大人民，一定会挺身出来强烈抗议这些准备原子战争的罪恶计划。
