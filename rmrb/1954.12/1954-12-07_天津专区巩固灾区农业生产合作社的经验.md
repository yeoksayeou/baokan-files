    Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, has a total of 2,001 old cooperatives. This year, 1,843 cooperatives suffered from rain and flood disasters, with 80% of the cooperative's land being flooded, resulting in severe production reductions. The disaster caused many new problems within the cooperatives: some middle peasant members with sideline production tools and skills felt that they were at a disadvantage in the cooperative and advocated going their separate ways; members with more high-lying land demanded changes to the cooperative's charter or wanted to withdraw; some members who had accumulated past investments felt they were losing out, were not actively investing or seeking production opportunities, and wavered between "dissolving" and "continuing"; members who contributed more labor felt that a year of hard work was not as good as selling short-term labor; poor members feared that the cooperative would collapse and they would be unable to overcome the famine and were restless... etc. The idea of relying on the government, and a lack of confidence in overcoming the famine, was widespread. In Fugezhuang Village, Wen'an County, some cooperative members said: "For big matters, we look to the Communist Party; for small matters, we look to the cooperative chairman; the members eat their fill and lie down." At that time, about one-third of the cooperatives were in danger of collapse, and twelve cooperatives that were originally not consolidated had already collapsed. Under these circumstances, the Party committees and general cadres in many areas also became hesitant about running the disaster-stricken cooperatives well.

    In response to the above situation, the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has continuously instructed the county and district committees to adopt the method of assigning areas of responsibility, focusing on cooperatives with more problems, strengthening specific leadership over disaster-stricken cooperatives, and rapidly carrying out production for self-relief, and not allowing cooperatives to collapse due to the disaster. In launching production, education work was first carried out targeting the members' mentality of dependence. The prefectural committee directly wrote a letter of condolence to the disaster-stricken cooperatives, encouraging members to overcome the disaster and pointing out the favorable conditions and ways to overcome difficulties. Party committees at all levels organized a large number of cadres to go deep into the disaster areas and disaster-stricken cooperatives, comforting, propagandizing, and organizing production at the same time. Many cadres and members were encouraged to study ways to overcome the famine, launch production competitions, and carry out "three searches" and "three calculations" – searching for production opportunities, searching for famine-relief experience, and searching for production increase tips; calculating income, calculating expenses, and calculating family savings and funds. The disaster victims in Xitanli Township, Wen'an County, originally requested a loan of 212 million yuan from the government. Under the influence of the agricultural production cooperative led by Liu Bingzhu, which tapped potential and turned dead money into active money, the whole township mobilized investment of 240 million yuan, buying and building 176 boats, solving the problem of fish-farming tools without loans. Renqiu, Ninghe, and Wuqing counties originally requested loans totaling 1.3 billion yuan for 358 cooperatives. After tapping potential, the loan amount was reduced to 490 million yuan. In terms of production technology, cooperatives taught and learned from each other, inviting "masters" and taking on "apprentices." Supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned companies solved the production and marketing problems of disaster victims through contracts, and promptly organized disaster victims to shift to fish farming, mat weaving, and other production, and the morale of the disaster victims initially stabilized. The Wuqing Sanqi Agricultural Cooperative had twelve households, and after the disaster, four households wanted to go out to make a living, and two households wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. After strengthening leadership and economic support, nineteen male members engaged in fish farming, fourteen female members, six in embroidery, and eight in gold foil production, earning 13 million yuan in one month. After repaying 5 million yuan in loans, they also bought 1,000 catties of bean cake in bulk to fertilize the wheat as a base fertilizer. After the dividend, member Wang Yucai saved 100,000 yuan in addition to family consumption and no longer wanted to withdraw from the cooperative. Various localities also used small representative meetings, symposiums, and other methods to exchange experiences and solve problems in a timely manner. While launching sideline and handicraft production, under the slogan of "striving to increase production and reduce the disaster situation," an agricultural production increase competition was also launched. Many cooperatives applied one additional topdressing of fertilizer to unflooded crops. In Renqiu alone, 171 cooperatives' more than 11,000 mu of unflooded farmland increased production by more than 119,000 catties compared to the original plan. In addition, the cooperatives also launched a movement to collect wild grass, wild vegetables, and collect non-staple foods.

    The chaotic thoughts of the cooperative members after the disaster mainly reflected the conflict of interests between the middle and poor peasants. Therefore, implementing the Party's class line in rural work and correctly implementing the mutually beneficial policy is the basic key to consolidating the cooperative. Various localities first started with summarizing the advantages of the cooperative, specifically pointing out the favorable conditions such as the large number of people in the cooperative, the great strength, mutual assistance and solidarity in overcoming the famine, so that the members realized that in the disaster year, everyone uniting and helping each other to overcome the difficulties and overcome the disaster was good for themselves and for the collective. Various localities also used the method of recollection to carry out in-depth class education to the members, explaining that in the past they were exploited by the landlords, and the land reform turned them all over, and now that there are difficulties, they must also unite and help each other to overcome the difficulties and overcome the disaster. On the basis of raising the awareness of the members, the mutually beneficial policy was specifically implemented. For example, in the income distribution of disaster-stricken cooperatives, the principle of first taking care of labor income and appropriately taking care of land was adopted. In order to adapt to the post-disaster situation, the investment, work-point recording, and dividend distribution methods for sideline production have also been changed accordingly in various places. The use of tools adopted methods such as private ownership and joint use with certain remuneration, or leasing. Cooperative investment generally adopts methods such as voluntary investment, interest payment, regular repayment of principal, or voluntary investment without interest. The work-point recording method also varies according to the specific situation. Those with skills, such as mat weaving, are generally recorded according to the number of pieces; for production such as fishing and goose hunting, where income fluctuates, some cooperatives adopt the method of averaging the labor days every ten or five days. In short, the content of production in disaster-stricken cooperatives is complex, requiring more reasonable work-point recording, and because members have many living difficulties, dividends are also required to be timely.

      At present, the production self-relief work of the disaster-stricken cooperatives in Tianjin Prefecture has been launched. Among the 1,843 disaster-stricken cooperatives, 1,351 cooperatives are confident of overcoming the famine. Consolidated and basically consolidated first- and second-class cooperatives account for 92.3% of the total number of old cooperatives. Because agricultural cooperatives have shown greater advantages in production and disaster relief, many farmers are actively requesting to join the cooperatives. By the end of October, 1,192 old cooperatives had absorbed more than 19,200 new members.

    天津专区巩固灾区农业生产合作社的经验
    张文奇
    河北省天津专区共有老社两千零一个，今年有一千八百四十三个社遭受了雨、水灾害，淹地占社有土地百分之八十，减产很严重。各社内因灾引起了很多新问题：有副业生产工具和技术的中农社员，认为在社内吃亏，主张各奔前程；高地多的社员，要求改变社章或要退社；有积蓄过去投资多的社员觉得吃了亏，不积极投资和想生产门路，动摇在“散”和“办”之间；出工多的社员认为白干一年不如卖短工；贫苦的社员怕社垮了自己无力渡荒而动荡不安……等。缺乏渡荒信心，依赖政府的思想普遍严重。文安县富各庄村有的社员说：“大事找共产党，小事找社长，社员吃饱了一躺。”当时有垮台危险的社约达三分之一，有十二个原来就不巩固的社已经垮台。在这种情况下，不少地区的党委和
  一般干部，对办好受灾的社也发生了动摇。
    根据上述情况，中共天津地委曾连续指示各县、区委，采取分片包干的办法，以问题较多的社为重点，加强对受灾社的具体领导，迅速开展生产自救，不允许因灾垮社。在发动生产中首先针对社员的依赖思想进行了教育工作。地委直接给各受灾社写了一封慰问信，鼓励社员战胜灾害并指出了有利条件和克服困难的办法。各级党委都组织了大批干部深入灾区灾社，边慰问、边宣传、边组织生产。很多干部和社员都振奋起来研究渡荒办法，发动生产竞赛，开展“三找”、“三算”——找生产门路、找渡荒经验、找增产窍门；算收入、算开支、算家底和资金。文安西滩里乡灾民原来向政府要求贷款两亿一千二百万元。在刘丙珠领导的农业生产合作社挖潜力变死财为活财的影响下，全乡发动投资二亿四千万元，买船和造船一百七十六只，不贷款也解决了治鱼工具问题。任邱、宁河、武清三县三百五十八个社原要求贷款达十三亿元。经过挖潜力，贷款数减少到四亿九千万元。在生产技术上，社和社之间互相请“师傅”、带“徒弟”，互教互学。供销合作社和国营公司通过合同形式解决灾民生产供销问题，及时组织灾民转入了治鱼、织席等生产，灾民情绪初步稳定。武清三齐农业社十二户，灾后有四户要外出谋生，两户要退社。经过加强领导和经济支持，十九个男社员治鱼，十四个女社员，六人绣花，八人打箔，一个月获利一千三百万元，除还贷款五百万元外，还伙买一千斤豆饼种麦施底肥。社员王玉才分红后，除全家吃用外，还积蓄十万元，不再闹退社。各地并运用小型代表会、座谈会等方法，及时交流经验解决问题。在发动副业、手工业生产的同时，在“力争增产，缩小灾情”的口号下，又开展了农业增产竞赛运动。很多社对未涝庄稼加施一次追肥，仅任邱一百七十一个社一万一千多亩未涝大田，就较原计划增产十一万九千多斤。此外，各社还开展了打野草、野菜，采集副食品运动。
    灾后社员的混乱思想，主要反映了中、贫农之间的利害矛盾。因此，贯彻党在农村工作中的阶级路线，正确执行互利政策，是巩固社的基本关键。各地首先从总结社的优越性入手，具体指出合作社人多力量大，互助互济团结渡荒等有利条件，使社员认识到，在灾荒年，大家团结互助，克服困难渡过灾荒对自己对集体的好处。各地还用回忆的办法，向社员深入进行了阶级教育说明过去受地主剥削，土地改革一同翻了身，现在有困难也要团结互助，一同克服困难渡灾荒。在提高社员觉悟的基础上，具体贯彻了互利政策。如对受灾社的收益分配采取先照顾劳力收入，适当照顾土地的原则。为了适应灾后情况，副业生产投资、记工、分红办法，各地也作了相应的改变。工具使用采取了私有伙用给一定报酬、或租用等办法。社内投资，一般采取自愿投资、行利息、定期还本或自愿投资不行息等办法。记工办法也根据具体情况有所不同。有技术的如织席等一般是按件记工；收入时多时少的治鱼、打雁等生产，有些社采取每十天或五天平均计算一次劳动日的办法。总之，灾区社的生产内容复杂，更要求记工合理，因社员生活困难多，分红也要求及时。
      目前，天津专区受灾社的生产自救工作已经开展起来了，在一千八百四十三个灾社中，已有一千三百五十一个社有把握渡过灾荒。巩固和基本巩固的一、二类社占老社总数百分之九十二点三。由于农业社在生产救灾中显示了更大的优越性，许多农民都积极要求入社，到十月底，已有一千一百九十二个老社，吸收新社员一万九千二百多户。
