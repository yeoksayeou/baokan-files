By the morning of the first day, rainfall in the middle reaches of the Huai River had reached 20 to 40 millimeters, and rainfall in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River had also reached more than 10 millimeters. The drought in areas along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers where autumn planting was lacking rain has been relieved.

    长江下游和淮河中游降雨
    对冬季作物很有好处
    长江下游、淮河中游一带正断续的下着细雨。到一日早晨，淮河中游两岸降雨量达二十公厘到四十公厘，长江下游雨量也达十公厘以上。原来江淮两岸秋种缺雨的地区旱象已解除。安徽省已播种的五千多万亩小麦、油菜、豌豆等作物生长良好。
