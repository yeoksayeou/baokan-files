    Farm Tools Should Be Properly Stored
    Hao Zhenjiang of the Qiqihar Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry in Heilongjiang writes: Last month, we focused on inspecting the storage of farm tools in the Gonghe Village of the Dahuodian District, and found that some mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives were doing a very poor job of storing farm tools. For example, the Qianjin Cooperative had been leaving the farm tools in the yard after use, some of which had already fallen apart, and parts were missing. Although the farm tools of the Jilin Cooperative had been put away in the house, the bearings of the disc harrows had not been cleaned, some of the farm tools that should have been oiled had not been oiled, and some of the things that should have been padded were not padded. It is understood that this situation also exists in other districts and villages. Some put farm tools in pig, sheep, and livestock pens, burying half of them in manure, and the farm tools are covered with old red rust; some use seeder seed boxes as horse troughs or chicken nests; some use spike-tooth harrows to block pig pen doors or use other farm tools as posts for tying livestock. If this problem does not attract attention, the phenomenon of "sharpening guns before the battle" and "being caught unprepared" will occur during next year's spring plowing. Therefore, I hope that relevant departments of local governments will conduct an inspection of the storage of farm tools, and promptly educate all agricultural cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farmers to pay attention to improving the storage of farm tools.

### 农具应该保管好

专栏：来信摘要

    农具应该保管好
    黑龙江齐齐哈尔市农林局郝振江来信：上个月我们重点检查了达胡店区共和村的农具保管情况，发现有些互助组和农业生产合作社农具保管工作做得很差。比如前进社在用完农具以后一直放在外面院子里，有的农具已经散开了，零件也丢失了。纪林社的农具虽然已经收拾在屋里，但圆盘耙的轴承没有洗，有的农具该抹油的地方也没有抹油，该垫一些东西的没有垫。这种情况，据了解在别的区、村也有。有的把农具放在猪、羊、牲口圈里，埋了半截粪尿，农具上都生了老红锈；有的把播种机种籽箱做马槽子或母鸡下蛋的窝；有的用钉齿耙挡猪圈门或用其他农具做拴牲口的桩子。这个问题如不引起注意，明年春耕时就会发生“临阵磨枪”
  “措手不及”的现象。因此，我希望各地政府有关部门对农具保管情况作一次检查，并及时教育各农业社、互助组以及个体农民，注意改进农具保管工作。
