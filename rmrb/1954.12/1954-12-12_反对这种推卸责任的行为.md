To the Editor:

The Ministry of Supervision received a case related to railway transportation. In order to handle this case, the consignor had contacted the railway department directly for a year. Subsequently, the case was investigated by the former Government Administration Council's Commission of People's Supervision, but even after four months, the problem remained unresolved.

Is it because the situation is complicated and difficult to handle? No! The event itself was originally very simple:

On July 10th of last year, the former Wuhan Department Store Purchasing and Supplying Station shipped a wagonload of white granulated sugar (30 tons) from Hankou Station to Meihekou in Northeast China. The next morning, they requested to change the destination to Dalian. After Hankou Station agreed, they completed the procedures according to regulations and paid the handling fee. When processing this request, the staff at Hankou Station failed to determine which station was the freight car marshalling station. A telegram was sent to Shenyang Station. After receiving the telegram, Shenyang Station simply put it aside, neither notifying the freight car marshalling station nor responding to Hankou Station. As a result, the 30 tons of granulated sugar arrived in Meihekou and were then shipped back to Dalian, resulting in a gratuitous round trip of over 400 kilometers and an extra 6.4 million yuan in freight charges for the consignor. Therefore, the consignor requested the railway department to refund this overcharged freight.

Why did such an apparently easy-to-resolve event remain unresolved for so long?

Initially, the problem lay with the leading organs of the aforementioned two stations—the Zhengzhou and Harbin Railway Administrations. After the consignor raised their concerns, the staff of these two administrations busied themselves with writing official documents. The content of these exchanges could be summarized in a simple dialogue:

	“Shenyang Station is being irresponsible by simply ignoring the telegram. Your bureau should refund the freight.”
	“That’s not right! It’s Hankou Station’s fault for sending the wrong telegram. Your bureau should refund the freight.”

Judging from the tone of the official documents, the two administrations believed that the overcharged freight should be refunded. However, due to mutual evasion, mutual recrimination, and mutual rebuttal, the consignor had not received the refund after five months and eleven official documents.

In January of this year, the consignor appealed to the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. In March, they received a reply stating, in essence, that the roundabout transportation seemed to be the responsibility of the consignor, and the overcharged freight could not be refunded at all.

Such a response was naturally unsatisfactory to the consignor. Therefore, the China Department Store Company contacted the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. They wrote official documents, made phone calls, and even spoke in person; the reply remained the same—the overcharged freight could not be refunded.

In July, the Supervision Office of the China Department Store Company requested the assistance of the former Government Administration Council’s Commission of People’s Supervision in handling the case. After numerous investigations and symposiums, the Business Bureau’s response remained unchanged, and even the Supervisory Bureau of the Ministry of Railways agreed with the Business Bureau’s opinion.

The Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways repeatedly claimed to have railway regulations as a basis for refusing to refund the overcharged freight. However, the Business Bureau did not and could not deny the fact that the consignor had completed the "change of destination" procedures according to regulations and that the railway department had accepted this request. The crux of the dispute lay in how to handle this "change of destination" request. The Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways stated in its reply:

	“The car was already en route when the change was accepted. Although the originating station telegraphed Shenyang Station, Shenyang Station was unable to intercept it… According to current railway regulations… there is no provision for the shipper to designate a location for handling the change. Therefore, changing the destination of the sugar car at Meihekou Station is not inconsistent with the spirit of the regulations.”

Let us examine the relevant railway regulations! Article 64, "Supplementary Rule Two" of the "Rules for the Transportation of Goods and Supplementary Rules," regarding "Changes," stipulates that if one wants to "change the destination" after the goods have been dispatched but have not arrived, the handling station should be "the station where the goods are located or a suitable station ahead of the station where the goods are located." In this case, would it not have been more appropriate to have the sugar car reorganized at the freight car marshalling station near Shenyang than to change the destination at Meihekou Station and transport it roundabout for over 400 kilometers? Therefore, is the fact that the car could not be "intercepted" at the appropriate station not due to errors in the work of the railway department? Can such roundabout transportation and waste of transportation capacity be permitted in the railway department?

Why can't the overcharged freight be refunded? The Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways said that this is because "when the sugar was delivered to Dalian, the shipper's purpose of changing the destination had been achieved, and the railway had actually carried out this transportation." In other words, "I have already made a mistake, so you have to pay." Precisely because they insisted on this erroneous attitude, the Ministry of Supervision had to submit the issue to the Minister of Railways for handling in early November.

The time has come. The Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways should seriously address the errors in its work and promptly examine and correct this bad attitude of shifting responsibility.

Editor's Note: Based on the situation reflected by readers, we contacted the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Railways. The Business Bureau admitted that the past handling was inappropriate and agreed to refund the overcharged freight; however, they did not conduct a self-criticism of this behavior of shifting responsibility. In order to improve work and prevent similar incidents from occurring, it is hoped that the Business Bureau will conduct a further review of this event.

### 反对这种推卸责任的行为

    反对这种推卸责任的行为编辑同志：
    监察部受理了一个有关铁路运输工作的事件。为了处理这个事件，托运单位曾直接和铁路部门联系了一年，接着经原政务院人民监察委员会查处，虽又经过了四个月，但是问题始终不能解决。
    是不是因为情节复杂、很难处理呢？不！这个事件本身原来是很简单的：
    去年七月十日，原武汉百货采购供应站在汉口车站把一车皮白砂糖（三十吨）运往东北梅河口。第二天上午，他们要求把白砂糖改运大连，经汉口车站同意后，按章办理了手续，缴纳了手续费。汉口车站的工作人员处理这项工作时没有查明那一个车站是货车编组站，一封电报发到了沈阳车站。沈阳车站接到电报后就随手一搁，既不转告货车编组站，也不答复汉口车站。于是，三十吨白砂糖到了梅河口，又转回大连，白白往返四百多公里，使托运单位多付了六百四十多万元运费。因此，托运单位要求铁路部门退还这笔多收的运费。
    像这样一个显然不难处理的事件为什么会长期得不到结果呢？
    开始，问题发生在上述两个车站的领导机关——郑州和哈尔滨两个铁路管理局。当托运单位提出意见以后，这两个机关的办事人员就为写公文而忙碌起来。这些来往公文的内容可以用很简单的对话来表达：
      “沈阳车站为什么把电报一压了事，太不负责任了。运费应该由你们局退。”
      “不对！这要怪汉口站发错了电报。运费应该由你局退才行。”
    从来往公文的口气看来，上述两个管理局认为这笔多收的运费是应该退出的，由于互相推诿，互相责难，互相批驳，来往公文十一件，五个月后托运单位还没有拿到应退的运费。
    今年一月，托运单位向铁道部商务局提出申诉。等到三月份收到了一封复信，大意是：迂回运输似乎应该由托运单位负责，多收的运费根本不能退还。
    这样的答复当然不能使托运单位满意。于是，又由中国百货公司和铁道部商务局联系。写了公文，打了电话，还当面谈了话；答复还是——多收的运费不能退还。
    中国百货公司监察室在七月份要求原政务院人民监察委员会协助处理这个事件。经过多次的调查和座谈，而商务局的答复还是照旧不变，甚至铁道部监察局也同意商务局的意见。
    铁道部商务局口口声声说是有铁路规章作根据，坚持不肯退出多收的运费。但是，对于托运单位已经按章办妥“变更到站”的手续，铁路部门也已经受理了这个请求的事实，商务局则没有否认，也不能否认。争执的关键在于应该怎样处理这个
  “变更到站”的要求。铁道部商务局在复信中说：
  “受理变更时车已在途中，虽经发站电知沈阳站，但沈阳站无法截留……根据铁路现行规章……没有发货人指定处理变更地点的规定，因此该车砂糖由梅河口站变更，与规定精神并无不合”。
    让我们来查一下有关的铁路规章吧！“货物运送规则及补则”“变更”一节第六十四条“补则二”规定：如果要“变更到站”，在货物已发送而未到达前，处理站应为“货物所在站或货物所在站前方的适当站”。这个事件中，让装砂糖的车皮在沈阳附近的货车编组站改编难道不比在梅河口站变更而迂回运输四百多公里更为适当吗？所以在适当站“无法截留”，难道不是由于铁路部门工作中的差错吗？难道这种迂回运输，浪费运输力的现象在铁路部门是可以允许的吗？
    为什么多收的运费不能退呢？铁道部商务局说，这是因为“砂糖运抵大连，则在货主已达变更之目的，在铁路已实际发生此项运送行为”。换句话说，“我已经错了，你就得给钱”。正由于他们一再坚持这种错误态度，监察部在十一月初不得不把问题提请铁道部长处理。
    是时候了，铁道部商务局应该严肃地对待自己工作中的差错，迅速检查和纠正这种推卸责任的恶劣态度。　　陆　远
    编者按：根据读者反映的情况，我们和铁道部商务局进行了联系。商务局承认过去的处理是不妥当的，同意退回多收的运费；但是他们对这种推卸责任的行为并没有进行检讨。为了改进工作，防止类似事件发生，希望商务局对这个事件作进一步的检查。
