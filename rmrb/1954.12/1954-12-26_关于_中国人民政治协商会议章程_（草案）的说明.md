Explanation of the "Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" (Draft)
    Zhang Bojun, Member of the Standing Committee of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

    The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has been established for more than five years now. Under the correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the CPPCC has carried out many significant tasks for the cause of the country and the people, which is a well-known fact. Due to the tremendous development and changes in our country and society in all aspects during these five years, especially the realization of the People's Congress system, the convocation of the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the original "Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" is no longer entirely suitable for the current situation. The Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the CPPCC resolved that the "Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" should be re-examined and revised based on the new situation and past experience, and entrusted this important task to the Standing Committee of the First National Committee. According to this resolution, the Standing Committee of the First National Committee organized a drafting group to draft the "Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference." After repeated research, the drafting group formulated the "Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" (Draft). This draft has been revised and approved by the Sixty-Fourth Session of the Standing Committee of the First National Committee and is now submitted to the congress for review and decision.

    First, it is necessary to explain the issue of the name. We believe that the "Organic Law of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" should be changed to the "Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" because the CPPCC is an organization of the people's democratic united front composed of various democratic parties and people's organizations. It is more appropriate to name its regulations as "Constitution," which can be distinguished from the organic laws and regulations of state organs and avoid confusion with the "laws" and "regulations" passed by state power organs that have mandatory legal effect. Just like the organizational rules of parties and people's organizations, it basically includes a general program and organizational articles, and its name is called "Party Constitution" or "Association Constitution" or "Constitution," as the Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party is a prominent example.

    The following is a brief explanation of some key points in the "Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" (Draft):

    I. About the General Program

    Since the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China has been convened, the CPPCC no longer exercises the functions and powers of the National People's Congress. However, as an organization of the people's democratic united front, it will still play a significant role in our country's political life. Therefore, the General Program clearly stipulates that the nature of the CPPCC in the future is "an organization of the people's democratic united front that unites all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic individuals in the country." Its nature is different from that of state organs on the one hand, and also different from that of general people's organizations on the other. It is the partisan people's democratic united front organization. In the future, its basic task is to continue to unite all ethnic groups in the country more broadly under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through the unity of various democratic parties and people's organizations, and work together to overcome difficulties, implement the Constitution, and strive to build a great socialist country.

    Since the Constitution of the People's Republic of China has been promulgated, the basic content of the "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" has been included in the Constitution, and this Common Program has been replaced by the Constitution. Therefore, the CPPCC no longer needs to formulate a common program like the one in the past. However, in order to accomplish the glorious historical mission of the CPPCC in the future, it is absolutely necessary to formulate the General Program of the Constitution as the common goal and code of conduct for all units and individuals participating in the CPPCC, based on the spirit of the Constitution.

    The General Program clearly stipulates that the fundamental requirement of the CPPCC is to victoriously build a socialist society in our country. In order to realize this fundamental requirement, the General Program stipulates the guidelines to be jointly observed by the units and individuals participating in the CPPCC, namely: (1) must support the Constitution of the People's Republic of China and actively strive to implement the Constitution; (2) must consolidate the people's democratic system led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and strengthen the leading position of socialist economic forces in the national economy; (3) must assist state organs, promote social forces, and realize the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation; (4) must strengthen contact with the masses, reflect their opinions, and make suggestions to relevant state organs; (5) must continuously consolidate and expand the revolutionary unity of the people of the whole country, and persist in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad; (6) must continue to consolidate and develop friendship with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, enhance friendship with all peace-loving countries, strengthen friendship with peace-loving people all over the world, and strive to oppose wars of aggression, defend world peace, and develop the cause of human progress; (7) must promote the study of Marxist-Leninist theory and state policies among all members of the people's democratic united front, improve their political level, and strive to carry out ideological transformation. Of course, the study of Marxist-Leninist theory is based on the principle of voluntariness and is not compulsory. According to the above seven guidelines and the opinions suggested by Chairman Mao, the CPPCC has major tasks such as conducting international activities, negotiating the list of candidates for the National People's Congress, making suggestions to relevant state organs, coordinating internal relations among the people, and studying.

    Comrades, in general, this part of the General Program is not only necessary but also important. The nature and tasks of the CPPCC as an organization of the people's democratic united front, as well as the code of conduct and goals to be jointly observed by all units and individuals participating in the CPPCC, are stipulated in principle in this General Program. Compared with adopting a list-based approach and formulating specific and detailed provisions, it is more generalized, which is appropriate.

    II. About the General Principles of Organization

    Chapter One of the Constitution stipulates the basic organizational principles of the National Committee and local committees of the CPPCC.

    Regarding the organizational issue of the CPPCC, since the People's Congress system has been realized, the CPPCC no longer needs to include regional and military units. The basis for the composition of the CPPCC is various democratic parties and people's organizations, but individuals can be absorbed when necessary, and there should be appropriate quotas for representatives of ethnic minorities and overseas Chinese.

    Regarding the organizational form of the CPPCC, according to the current actual situation and actual needs, the original three levels of the Plenary Session, the National Committee, and the Standing Committee will be changed to two levels: the Plenary Session of the National Committee and the Standing Committee. The local committees are also two levels, namely, the Plenary Session of the Local Committee and the Standing Committee. This can reduce unnecessary levels, facilitate work, and appropriately expand the number of members of the National Committee and local committees, still maintaining broad representation and facilitating the strengthening of unity.

    Regarding the internal relations of the CPPCC, Articles 3 and 4 stipulate that the units and individuals participating in the CPPCC have the obligation to abide by the Constitution and resolutions of the CPPCC, and also have the freedom to withdraw from the CPPCC; they should execute resolutions according to the principle of the minority obeying the majority, and they can also reserve dissenting opinions to be submitted for discussion at the next meeting. Article 5 stipulates that those who seriously violate the Constitution and resolutions of the CPPCC should be disciplined, and those who disagree with the discipline are allowed to request reconsideration or file a complaint. At the same time, Article 4 stipulates that resolutions should be passed by more than half of all members, rather than more than half of the members attending the meeting. We believe that the above provisions are completely suitable for our united front organization, which aims to unite all ethnic groups, democratic classes, democratic parties, people's organizations, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic democratic individuals in the country, and suitable for such a political consultative organization. These provisions demonstrate the political unity and full democratic spirit of the CPPCC, that is, the spirit of democratic centralism.

    Regarding the relationship between the upper and lower levels of the CPPCC's various organizations, Articles 3 and 6 stipulate that local committees at all levels must abide by and implement the Constitution of the CPPCC and the national resolutions and calls of the National Committee; Article 7 stipulates that higher-level organizations have a guiding relationship with lower-level organizations. This not only demonstrates the political unity of the CPPCC's various organizations, but also facilitates local committees at all levels to adapt to local conditions and fully develop local initiative and creativity.

    III. About the National Committee

    Article 9 provides a more general provision on the tasks and functions of the National Committee, namely: "In accordance with the General Program of the Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, conduct consultations and work on important matters related to the country's political life and the people's democratic united front." Except for the several functions and powers that must be exercised by the Plenary Session of the National Committee as stipulated in Article 14, the rest are not listed. This is because: the National Committee's execution of its tasks and functions is based on the seven guidelines in the General Program, etc. If the tasks and functions of the National Committee are listed again, it will inevitably repeat the seven guidelines in the General Program, etc. The tasks and functions of the National Committee, except for the functions and powers stipulated in Article 14, can be executed by the Standing Committee during the adjournment of the Plenary Session of the National Committee.

    Regarding the session period of the Plenary Session of the National Committee, according to the results of discussions in various groups, it is stipulated that the Plenary Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC shall be held once a year, and the Standing Committee may convene it earlier or postpone it when it deems necessary; at the same time, it is also stipulated that the Plenary Session of the Local Committee of the CPPCC shall be held at least once a year. We believe that this provision is appropriate.

    IV. About Local Committees

    The scope of establishment of local committees should be determined based on the actual situation and actual needs of social relations and ethnic relations in various places. Therefore, Article 17 stipulates that local committees shall be established in provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and cities. As for other places, including autonomous prefectures, counties, autonomous counties, and urban districts, local committees shall be established only when necessary. Regarding the issue of establishing local committees in counties, we believe that: counties are mainly agricultural areas with relatively simple social relations. Therefore, except for a few counties where it is necessary to establish local committees, most counties do not need to establish local committees. At the same time, some cities, such as those with small populations and relatively simple social relations, can also consider not establishing local committees.

    Comrades, this draft Constitution has been discussed by all the members present at the preparatory meeting. During the discussion process, many members, in the spirit of doing a good job and holding a good meeting, have repeatedly and seriously studied the entire draft and put forward many valuable opinions. The reasonable suggestions that should be accepted have been adopted by the Standing Committee, such as the revisions of Articles 5, 13, and 23, which are prominent examples. At the same time, there are some good opinions that we feel do not necessarily need to be written into the Constitution, and therefore have not been adopted in the draft Constitution.

    Comrades, formulating the Constitution of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is an important task of our conference. I have only made some explanations on some key points in the draft Constitution. Whether they are appropriate or not, please review them.

    关于“中国人民政治协商会议章程”（草案）的说明
    中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会常务委员会委员 章伯钧
    中国人民政治协商会议自成立到现在已经五年多了。在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席正确的领导下，中国人民政治协商会议对于国家和人民事业，进行了许多重大的工作，这是大家所知道的事实。由于在这五年中间，我们的国家和社会在各方面都有了巨大的发展和变化，特别是人民代表大会制度的实现，召开了中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，颁布了中华人民共和国宪法，因而原有的“中国人民政治协商会议组织法”，已经不完全适合于当前的情况。中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议决议：对于“中国人民政治协商会议组织法”应当依据新的情况和以往的经验，重新加以研究和修改，并且把这项重要的工作委托第一届全国委员会常务委员会来做。根据这个决议，第一届全国委员会常务委员会组织了起草小组，进行草拟“中国人民政治协商会议章程”的工作。起草小组经过多次的反复研究，拟定了“中国人民政治协商会议章程”（草案）。这个草案已经由第一届全国委员会常务委员会第六十四次会议修正通过，现在将这个草案提请大会审查和决定。
    首先需要说明的是名称问题。我们认为“中国人民政治协商会议组织法”应当改为“中国人民政治协商会议章程”，因为中国人民政治协商会议是以各民主党派、各人民团体为基础所组成的人民民主统一战线的组织，它的规章定名为“章程”是比较适当的，这可以同国家机关的组织法和条例有所区别，可以避免同国家权力机关所通过的具有强制性的法律效力的“法”和“条例”相混淆；也正如党派和人民团体的组织规章一样，其中基本包括总纲和组织条文两部分，而它的名称则称为“党章”或“会章”或“章程”，如同中国共产党的党章就是一个显著的例子。
    以下对“中国人民政治协商会议章程”（草案）中的若干要点作些简要说明：
    一、关于总纲
    由于中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议已经召开，中国人民政治协商会议已不再代行全国人民代表大会的职权，但是它作为人民民主统一战线的组织在我国政治生活中仍将发挥重大的作用。因此，总纲明确地规定了：今后中国人民政治协商会议的性质是“团结全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和其他爱国民主人士的人民民主统一战线的组织”。它的性质一方面不同于国家机关，另一方面也不同于一般的人民团体。它是党派性的人民民主统一战线的组织。今后它的基本任务是在中国共产党领导下，继续通过各民主党派、各人民团体的团结，更广泛地团结全国各族人民，共同努力，克服困难，为贯彻宪法的实施，建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。
    由于中华人民共和国宪法已经颁布，“中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领”的基本内容已经列入宪法，这个共同纲领已经为宪法所代替，因而中国人民政治协商会议不需要再制定一个像过去那样的共同纲领。但是为了完成中国人民政治协商会议今后的光荣的历史任务，根据宪法的精神，制定了章程的总纲，作为参加中国人民政治协商会议的各单位和个人共同的奋斗目标和行动准则，这是完全必要的。
    总纲中明确规定：中国人民政治协商会议的根本要求是在我国胜利地建成社会主义社会。为着实现这个根本要求，总纲中规定了参加中国人民政治协商会议的单位和个人共同遵守的准则，即：（1）必须拥护中华人民共和国宪法并为贯彻宪法的实施而积极努力；（2）必须巩固工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主制度和加强社会主义经济力量在国民经济中的领导地位；（3）必须协助国家机关，推动社会力量，实现国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造；（4）必须加强联系群众工作，反映群众意见，向有关的国家机关提出建议；（5）必须不断地巩固和扩大全国人民的革命大团结，坚持对国内外敌人的斗争；（6）必须继续巩固和发展同苏联和各人民民主国家的友谊，增进同一切爱好和平的国家的友谊，加强同全世界爱好和平的人民的友谊，为反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平和发展人类的进步事业而奋斗；（7）必须推动人民民主统一战线的全体成员学习马克思列宁主义的理论，学习国家的政策，提高政治水平，努力进行思想改造，对于马列主义理论的学习，当然是根据自愿原则，不是强迫。根据上述七项准则和毛主席提示的意见，中国人民政治协商会议有进行国际活动、协商人民代表大会代表的候选人名单、向有关的国家机关提出建议、协调人民内部关系和学习等主要任务。
      各位委员，总起来说，总纲这一部分不仅是必要的，而且是重要的。关于作为中国人民民主统一战线的组织——中国人民政治协商会议的性质和任务，以及参加中国人民政治协商会议的各单位和个人共同遵守的行动准则和奋斗目标，在这个总纲中都作了原则性的规定，较之采用列举的方式，制定具体的详尽的条文，更具有概括性，这是适当的。
    二、关于组织总则
    章程的第一章规定了中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会和地方委员会的基本的组织原则。
    关于中国人民政治协商会议的组织问题，由于人民代表大会制度已经实现，中国人民政治协商会议不再需要包含区域和军队的单位。中国人民政治协商会议组成的基础是各民主党派、各人民团体，但在有必要的时候可以吸收个人参加，并应当有适当名额的少数民族和国外华侨的代表。
    关于中国人民政治协商会议的组织形式问题，根据当前的实际情况和实际需要，将原来的全体会议、全国委员会、常务委员会三层，改为全国委员会全体会议和常务委员会两层；地方委员会也是两层，即地方委员会全体会议和常务委员会。这样既可以减少不必要的层次，便于进行工作，又可以适当扩大全国委员会和地方委员会的名额，仍然保持广泛的代表性和有利于加强团结。
    关于中国人民政治协商会议内部关系问题，第三条、第四条规定参加中国人民政治协商会议的单位和个人，既有遵守中国人民政治协商会议的章程和决议的义务，也有退出中国人民政治协商会议的自由；既应根据少数服从多数的原则执行决议，也可以保留不同意见到下次会议提出讨论。第五条规定既要对严重违反中国人民政治协商会议的章程和决议者给以处分，又允许对处分不服者请求覆议或提出申诉。同时，第四条规定了以全体委员的过半数通过决议，而不以出席会议的委员的过半数通过决议。我们认为以上规定是完全适合于我们这样一个旨在团结全国各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派、各人民团体、国外华侨和其他爱国民主人士的统一战线组织的，适合于这样一个政治协商组织的。这些规定，表明了中国人民政治协商会议的政治上的统一性和充分的民主精神，即民主集中制的精神。
    关于中国人民政治协商会议各级组织的上下关系问题，第三条、第六条规定各级地方委员会都要遵守和实行中国人民政治协商会议的章程和全国委员会的全国性的决议和号召；第七条规定上级组织对下级组织是指导关系。这既表明了中国人民政治协商会议各级组织的政治上的统一性，又利于各级地方委员会因地制宜，充分发挥地方的积极性和创造性。
    三、关于全国委员会
    关于全国委员会的任务和职权，第九条作了比较概括的规定，即：“根据中国人民政治协商会议章程的总纲，就有关国家政治生活和人民民主统一战线的重要事项，进行协商和工作。”除第十四条规定了必须由全国委员会全体会议行使的几项职权外，其余都没有列举。这是因为：全国委员会执行自己的任务和职权的依据，就是总纲中的七项准则等项，如果再列举全国委员会的任务和职权，势必同总纲中的七项准则等项相重复。全国委员会的任务和职权，在全国委员会全体会议闭会期间除第十四条规定的职权外，都可由常务委员会负责执行。
    关于全国委员会全体会议的会期，根据各组讨论的结果，规定为中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会全体会议每年举行一次，常务委员会认为有必要的时候，可以提前或延期召集；同时，中国人民政治协商会议地方委员会的全体会议也规定为每年至少举行一次。我们认为这样规定是适宜的。
    四、关于地方委员会
    关于地方委员会的设立范围，应当依据各地社会关系和民族关系的实际情况和实际需要而定。因此，第十七条规定省、自治区、直辖市和市设地方委员会。至于其他地方，包括自治州、县、自治县和市辖区等，在有必要的时候，才设地方委员会。其中关于县设地方委员会的问题，我们认为：县主要是农业区，社会关系比较简单，因此，除少数的县在有必要的时候可以设地方委员会外，大部分的县不需要设地方委员会。同时，有些市，如因人口少，社会关系比较简单，也可以考虑不设地方委员会。
    各位委员，这个章程草案是曾经全体到会委员在预备会中讨论过的。在讨论过程中，许多委员都本着作好工作、开好会议的精神，对于全部草案进行了反复的认真的研究，提出了不少宝贵的意见。其中应当接受的合理的建议，都已由常务委员会采用，如第五条、第十三条、第二十三条等条的修正就是显著的例子。同时也有些好的意见，我们觉得不一定要写在章程内，因而没有在章程草案中采纳进去。
    各位委员，制定中国人民政治协商会议章程是我们这次会议的一项重要任务。我只是对章程草案中的若干要点作了一些说明，是否有当，请加审议。
