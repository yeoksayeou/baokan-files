    Joint Statement of China National Import and Export Corporation and the Netherlands Business Delegation
    The Netherlands trade delegation, organized by the Netherlands Committee for Trade with China, arrived in Beijing on December 11 and held discussions with the China National Import and Export Corporation, various Chinese export corporations, and the China Overseas Transportation Corporation. Negotiations concluded on December 28, and the delegation members will return to the Netherlands after visiting Shanghai. The negotiations took place in a friendly and sincere atmosphere.
    The main purpose of the Netherlands business delegation's visit to China was to explore the possibilities of developing trade between China and the Netherlands and to discuss specific transactions. During their stay in Beijing, the various members of the delegation held extensive discussions with the China National Import and Export Corporation and various Chinese export corporations, and signed specific transaction contracts, enabling both parties to better understand each other's needs and supply possibilities. China is carrying out its Five-Year Plan for economic construction and has considerable needs for Dutch ships, fertilizers, power generation equipment, chemicals, Western medicines, hardware, etc.; the Netherlands also has considerable needs for Chinese oilseeds, animal products, native products, food, tea, etc. Both parties believe that the existing obstacles to trade have prevented trade between China and the Netherlands from developing to the extent it should. Both sides are deeply convinced that once these obstacles are removed and trade returns to normal, the volume of trade between them will undoubtedly increase greatly.
    In addition, Mr. Szapski, head of the delegation, and Mr. Cao Zhongshu, acting manager of the China National Import and Export Corporation, exchanged views on general issues related to the development of Sino-Dutch trade. Both sides agreed that increasing mutual exchanges is beneficial to the development of trade between the two countries. Both sides also believe that if direct business relations could be established between the banks of China and the Netherlands, it would facilitate the development of trade between the two countries. The two sides also held negotiations on the terms of the transaction contracts and achieved satisfactory results.
    Both sides believe that the visit of the Netherlands business delegation was fruitful, and that through this visit, the original trade relations between China and the Netherlands have been consolidated, and mutual understanding has been enhanced, laying a good foundation for the further development of trade between China and the Netherlands in the future.

    中国进出口公司、荷兰工商界访问团联合声明
    荷兰对中国贸易委员会所组织的荷兰工商界访问团于十二月十一日抵达北京，同中国进出口公司和中国各出口公司和中国海外运输公司进行了商谈。谈判于十二月二十八日结束，访问团各团员将于访问上海后回荷兰。谈判是在友好诚恳的空气中进行的。
    荷兰工商界访问团此次来中国的主要目的是探讨发展中荷两国间贸易的可能性，并商谈具体交易。在北京期间，访问团的各个团员分别同中国进出口公司和中国各出口公司进行了广泛的商谈，并签订了具体交易合同，使双方更好地了解了彼此的需要和供应的可能。中国正在进行着五年计划经济建设，对荷兰的船只、肥田粉、发电设备、化工、西药、五金等都有相当大的需要；荷兰对中国所产的油籽油料、畜产、土产、食品、茶叶等也有相当大的需要。双方认为，由于目前贸易中还存在着障碍，使中荷两国贸易还没有得到应有程度的发展。双方深信，只要这种障碍消除，贸易恢复正常，彼此之间的贸易量无疑地将会大大地增加。
    此外，访问团团长沙普先生和中国进出口公司代经理曹中枢先生就发展中荷贸易的一般性问题交换了意见，双方一致认为增加相互之间的往来是对发展两国间的贸易有利的。双方也认为如果中荷两国之间的银行能够建立直接的业务往来是会便利于两国贸易的开展的。在交易合同的条款上双方也进行了洽谈，并获得了满意的结果。
    此次荷兰工商界访问团的访问，双方认为是有收获的，认为通过这次访问，巩固了中荷两国的原有贸易关系，并增进了相互间的谅解，为今后中荷两国贸易的进一步发展打下了良好的基础。
