Xinhua News Agency, December 1st:

    Prime Minister U Nu of the Union of Burma, invited by our government to visit, issued the following written statement at the airport upon arriving in Beijing:

    Of course, I don't need to tell you how delighted I am to be in Beijing. In fact, this is my second visit to your great country of China. My first visit to China was in December 1939, when the Chinese people were heroically resisting Japanese aggression. At that time, as a member of a Burmese goodwill delegation, I went to Chongqing to give moral support to the Chinese people's struggle against Japanese fascism.

    I am very happy to be visiting this country at a time when your great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and other leaders of the People's Republic of China are building a socialist country. I eagerly look forward to seeing firsthand the great strides being made by the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people towards this goal.

    In fact, there are three goals that prompted me to visit this country:

    (1) To personally witness the various efforts of your leaders and the Chinese people in building a new society;

    (2) To renew my acquaintance with my respected friend Premier Zhou Enlai, and to take this opportunity to get to know other leaders of the People's Republic of China;

    (3) To lay a solid foundation for the establishment of friendly relations between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma.

    I am fully confident that, with the cooperation of our Chinese friends, these goals will certainly be achieved.

    吴努总理在机场发表书面谈话
    【新华社一日讯】应我国政府邀请前来访问的缅甸联邦总理吴努到达北京后，在机场上发表书面谈话如下：
    当然，我用不着告诉你们我是多么高兴到北京来。事实上，这是我对中国这个伟大的国家的第二次访问。我第一次访问中国是在一九三九年十二月中国人民正在英勇地抵抗日本侵略的时候。那时，我以一个缅甸亲善代表团员的身份到重庆去给中国人民反对日本法西斯主义者的斗争以道义上的支持。
    我十分高兴，正当你们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席和中华人民共和国的其他领袖正在建设一个社会主义国家的时候来到了这个国家，我热切地盼望着亲自看到中国领袖和中国人民向着这个目标大踏步前进。
    事实上，促使我来访问这个国家的有三个目标：
    （一）亲自看看你们的领袖和中国人民建设一个新社会的各种努力；
    （二）同我尊敬的朋友周恩来总理叙旧，并趁这个机会结识中华人民共和国其他领袖；
    （三）为中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦之间建立友好关系奠定牢固的基础。
    我完全相信，在我们中国朋友的合作下，这些目标一定能达到。
