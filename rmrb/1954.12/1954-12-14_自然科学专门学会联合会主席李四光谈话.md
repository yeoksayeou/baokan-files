    Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement regarding the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" clearly points out that this treaty is an attempt by the U.S. government to legitimize its barbaric act of armed occupation of Taiwan and to make prior arrangements for expanding its war of aggression against mainland China. At the same time, the statement also sternly refutes all the hypocritical and deceptive propaganda issued by the U.S. government and its echoers to whitewash this treaty.
    Since the victorious conclusion of the Geneva Conference, peace-loving governments and people around the world have been rejoicing in the gradual easing of international tensions, and the Soviet Union's consistently advocated policy of peace has received wider support. Some countries are even expecting to establish friendly relations with each other based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. At such a turning point for peace, the first since World War II, U.S. imperialism has blatantly and arrogantly carried out a series of shameless acts of aggression, creating new tensions: arming West Germany, intensifying control over South Vietnam, strengthening military assistance to Syngman Rhee, piecing together the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Group, and recently concluding this aggressive U.S.-Chiang treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which is spurned by the Chinese people, bringing the shadow of war back from across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to the periphery of the Eurasian continent. This series of concrete facts of U.S. imperialism opposing the people, creating divisions, and preparing for a new war cannot be concealed from the people of the world. The Chinese people believe that the U.S.-Chiang treaty is invalid, and it is impossible for U.S. imperialism to use it to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating their own territory, Taiwan.
    When all good people around the world, especially those who are loyal to the noble purpose of scientific endeavors, are striving to use atomic energy entirely for the development of peaceful construction and to play a huge constructive role in our new era, spokesmen of the U.S. government, and especially some generals who have personally witnessed the disasters of war suffered by the people of Western Europe, are clamoring behind this series of arrogant acts, saying that they will use atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. As Zhang Wentian, the Chinese government representative, quoted at the Moscow European Conference, a Chinese proverb says well, beware of “lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet.” Now we can also use a common Western metaphor to remind the warmongering generals: if you really want to "play with fire," you had better seriously consider under what conditions the destructive power of fire is most terrible.
    We Chinese scientific workers, like the broad masses of the Chinese people, have always adhered to the belief of loving peace, which is forged by our country's long cultural tradition. Because of this, our efforts to apply modern scientific achievements to the benefit of mankind, like the epoch-making initiative of the Soviet Union to use atomic energy for power plants, are no less than our love and promotion of the rich scientific and cultural heritage handed down from ancient China. We love peace. We are willing to unite with all peace-loving people and righteous scientists from all countries for the common welfare of mankind to fight for the cause of defending peace. No trickery of the aggressors can shake our determination to liberate Taiwan and stop aggression in the slightest. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement representing the unanimous will of the people of the whole country. Every one of our scientific workers must take action to help complete this sacred mission.

### 自然科学专门学会联合会主席李四光谈话

    自然科学专门学会联合会主席李四光谈话
    周恩来外交部长关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的声明清楚地指出：这个条约是美国政府企图使它武装侵占台湾的横暴行为合法化，并为对中国大陆扩大侵略战争作了预先的安排。同时，声明也严正地驳斥了美国政府及其应声虫们为了粉饰这个条约所发出的一切虚伪和欺骗的宣传。
    自日内瓦会议胜利闭幕后，全世界爱好和平的政府和人民都在庆幸国际紧张局势已日见和缓，苏联一贯倡导的和平政策得到更广泛的支持。有些国家还正在期望根据和平共处的五项原则建立相互间的友好关系。就在这样一个自第二次世界大战后第一次出现的和平转机的时候，美帝国主义公然又狂妄地作出了一系列无耻的侵略勾当，制造新的紧张局势：武装西德，加紧对南越的控制，加强对李承晚的军事援助，拼凑所谓东南亚防御集团，最近又和中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石卖国集团缔结这个侵略性的美蒋条约，重新把战争的阴影从大西洋和太平洋彼岸带到了欧亚大陆的周围。美帝国主义这一系列反对人民、制造分裂、准备新战争的具体事实，在全世界人民面前是无法掩饰的。中国人民认为美蒋条约是无效的，美帝国主义想借此来阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾也是不可能的。
    当全世界善良的人们，尤其是忠于科学事业的崇高目的的人们，正在争取将原子能完全用来发展和平建设、为我们新时代发挥巨大建设性作用的时候，美国政府的发言人，尤其可怪的是还有某些曾亲自目睹西欧人民所遭受的大战灾难的将军们，却在这一系列狂妄行为的后面大肆叫嚣，说什么要使用原子武器、氢武器。中国政府代表张闻天在莫斯科欧洲会议上引用了一句中国古话说得好，要当心
  “搬起石头打自己的脚”。现在我们还可以用西方常用的比喻来提醒好战的将军们：如果你们真要
  “玩火”，最好是认真地考虑考虑，火的破坏力在什么条件之下发挥得最可怕。
    我们中国科学工作者，和广大的中国人民一样，一向坚持由我国悠久文化传统所铸成的酷爱和平的信念。正因为如此，我们对于把近代科学成果用到人类造福方面的努力，像苏联把原子能用到发电站那样划时代的创举一样，是远不减于我们对我国古代流传下来的丰富科学文化遗产的爱护和发扬的。我们热爱和平。我们愿意为人类共同福利与各国一切爱好和平的人民和正义的科学家们联合起来为保卫和平事业而奋斗。侵略者的任何鬼蜮伎俩都不能丝毫动摇我们解放台湾、制止侵略的决心。我们坚决拥护周外长代表全国人民一致意志的声明。我们每一个科学工作者一定要以自己的行动来协力完成这个神圣任务。　（新华社）
