Channel Navigation Reform Completed on the Sichuan River; Sectional Night Navigation Begins

The reform of channel navigation markers on the Sichuan River (the upper reaches of the Yangtze River from Yichang to Chongqing) has been successfully completed, and sectional night navigation on the Sichuan River officially opened on the morning of the 18th. There are now 1,316 navigation markers set up on the Sichuan River, where the water is rapid, there are many dangerous shoals, and the channel is narrow. Among these, 928 markers are equipped with nighttime lighting. As a result, 43.7 percent of the 666-kilometer Sichuan River is now navigable at night. After several trial voyages, it has been proven that the turnover rate of ships can be increased by 20 percent. This not only protects passenger and cargo ships traveling upstream from the effects of short daylight hours and foggy seasons in winter, but the navigation markers also reduce and prevent maritime accidents, ensuring the safe navigation of ships.

Although simple navigation signals were installed on the Sichuan River as early as 1915, these signals only facilitated the plunder of resources by imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary ships. The technology and management methods were extremely backward and chaotic, often causing maritime accidents. This navigation marker reform was conducted by learning from the advanced experience of Soviet inland river navigation markers and with the specific assistance of Soviet channel expert Comrade Klemikov. The reformed navigation markers are like a chain, one closely following the other. In dangerous sections, navigation markers are arranged on both sides to form channels, ensuring safe navigation for ships traveling within these channels.

The Sichuan River navigation marker reform project underwent thorough preparation from January to September this year. With the hard work of the channel engineering personnel, overcoming many difficulties, the task was finally completed ten days ahead of schedule, from October 20 to November 11.

The installation of scientific navigation markers on such a complex channel as the Sichuan River has not only further realized the transport potential of the Sichuan River and further strengthened the exchange of goods between the southwest and the interior of the motherland, promoting the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production in the southwest, but it is also a technological innovation in China's inland river channel engineering, which has great significance for the reform of inland river navigation markers nationwide. Therefore, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration solemnly held a "Celebration Conference for the Completion of the Sichuan River Navigation Marker Reform and the Opening of Sectional Night Navigation" in Yichang on the afternoon of the 17th of this month. More than 800 representatives from the Ministry of Communications, Yichang City, inland river shipping administrations of Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, and the joint state-private Min Sheng and Chuan Jiang steamship companies attended the conference.

New Ward Building at Tongren Hospital Begins Admitting Patients

The new ward building at Beijing Tongren Hospital, with a capacity of 500 beds, opened on the 18th and began admitting patients on the 20th. The new ward building has a floor area of more than 20,000 square meters. The new building is fully equipped, including internal medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, and pediatrics wards. Each ward is equipped with a patient lounge, a doctor's duty room, and a nurse's locker room. Some wards also have balconies and bathrooms. In terms of treatment, each ward is equipped with a supply room, a disinfection room, a waste disposal room, a treatment room, a food preparation room, and a laboratory. There are thirteen operating rooms in all the wards, and the operating rooms are equipped with universal operating tables, ultra-shortwave electrotherapy equipment, X-ray machines, and heating equipment.

    川江航标改革完成并开始分段夜航
    长江上游从宜昌到重庆的川江航标改革工作已胜利完成，川江夜航已在十八日清晨正式分段开放。现在在水急、滩险多、河道狭窄的川江上，已设置了一千三百十六座导航标志。其中有九百二十八座标志夜间都设有灯光导航。这样，就使全长六百六十六公里的川江，有百分之四十三点七的地区可以夜航。经过多次试航，证明船舶周转率可以提高百分之二十。不但使上水行驶的客货轮不受冬季昼短夜长及雾季的影响，而且有了导航标志就可减少和避免海损事故，保障船舶的安全航行。
    川江虽然在一九一五年起就设有简单的航行信号，但这些信号仅仅便利于帝国主义和国民党反动派的船只掠夺资源；在技术上、管理方法上十分落后和紊乱，常引起海损事故的发生。这次的航标改革，是学习了苏联内河航标的先进经验，并在苏联航道专家克勒米克夫同志具体帮助下进行的。改革后的航标，像锁链一样，一个紧接一个。在险要地段，航标在两旁排成巷道，船只在巷道中航行，就可保证安全。
    川江航标改革工程从今年一月份到九月份进行了充分的准备工作，在航道工程人员的艰苦努力下，克服许多困难，终于在十月二十日到十一月十一日提前十天完成任务。
    由于在川江这样复杂的航道上，设置了科学的航标，不仅进一步发挥了川江的运输潜力，进一步加强了祖国的西南和内地的物资交流，促进西南工农业生产的迅速发展，而且在我国内河航道工程上也是一个技术革新，对全国内河航标改革有重大意义。因此，长江航运管理局特于本月十七日下午在宜昌隆重举行“庆祝川江航标改革暨分段开放夜航典礼”大会，到会的有交通部、宜昌市，以及江苏、江西、福建等省内河航运管理局，公私合营民生、川江两轮船公司等单位的代表共八百多人。同仁医院新建病房大楼开始接收病人
    北京市同仁医院能容五百张病床的新建病房大楼已在十八日开幕，并在二十日开始接收病人。新建病房大楼建筑面积为两万多平方公尺。新楼设备十分完善，里面包括内科、外科、眼科、小儿科等病房，各科病房都设有病人休息室、大夫值班室、护士更衣室；有的病房并设有阳台、洗澡间等。在治疗方面，各科病房都设有供应室、消毒室、污物处理室、治疗室、配膳室、化验室等。各科病房共有十三个手术室，手术室内设有万能手术台、超短波电疗器、爱克斯光机及烤电设备。　（万桂荃）
