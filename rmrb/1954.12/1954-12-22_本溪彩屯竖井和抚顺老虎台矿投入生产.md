The Benxi Caitun Vertical Shaft, one of China's modern large-scale mines, was officially put into production on December 15th. On the morning of that day, a handover ceremony was held. At the meeting, 197 model workers and 34 advanced groups who emerged during the mine construction process were awarded.

The scale of the Caitun Vertical Shaft is vast. In the coalfield of 19 square kilometers around the shaft bottom, more than 50 kilometers of crisscrossing tunnels have been excavated, and 32 kilometers of transportation railway have been laid. These well-connected tunnels and railways are equipped with street lights, illuminating this "underground factory" brightly. More than 30 kilometers of cables have been erected above and below ground, driving the operation of more than 400 electric motors. The entire production process of the Caitun Vertical Shaft, from coal mining to transportation and finally loading the coal onto trains for external transportation, except for the two processes of loading coal onto scraper conveyors and picking stones in the coal preparation plant, is entirely replaced by mechanized and automated operations, eliminating heavy manual labor.

The coal from the Caitun Vertical Shaft has three major characteristics: low phosphorus, low sulfur, and strong caking properties, making it a primary coking coal. It can be used to produce high-quality steel. After the mine is put into production, its coal output will more than double the existing output of Benxi's inclined shafts.

Xinhua News Agency: On December 20th, the expansion project of the Fushun Laohutai Mine, one of China's key coal mine construction projects, was officially handed over for production. On the afternoon of the same day, after the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the brand-new bottom-of-shaft yard in the expanded area, formal production began.

In this ancient coal capital, the coal in the shallow coalfields of various large mines is gradually approaching the end of its mining life. In the next few years, various mines will extend downwards in order to massively exploit richer deep coalfields. The expansion project of the Laohutai Mine is the first extension project for the coal capital to exploit deep coalfields. The people building the mine in Fushun call it the "vanguard project" for large-scale mine construction. After only two years of construction, the expanded area can produce more than one million tons of coal annually. Because this expansion project utilizes the existing shafts, equipment for transporting coal to the surface, and coal preparation plant, it not only reduces investment by one-third compared with large vertical shafts but also enables production three or four years earlier, supplying the rapidly growing industrial coal needs of the country.

### 本溪彩屯竖井和抚顺老虎台矿投入生产

    本溪彩屯竖井和抚顺老虎台矿投入生产
    我国现代化大型矿井之一的本溪彩屯竖井，在十二月十五日正式投入生产了。当日午前，举行了移交生产大会。会上并奖励了在建井过程中涌现出的一百九十七名劳动模范和三十四个先进小组。
    彩屯竖井的规模是浩大的。在井下方圆十九平方公里的大块煤田里，开凿了五十多公里纵横交错的巷道，铺设了三十二公里长的运输铁道。在这些四通八达的巷道和铁道旁都安设着路灯，照耀着这座“地下工厂”明亮辉煌。在井上井下架设了三十余公里长的电缆，带动着四百多台电动机的运转。彩屯竖井从采煤到运输和最后把煤装上火车外运的整个生产过程，除把煤装上刮板运输机和选煤场挑石头这两项工序之外，全部以机械化自动化代替了笨重的体力劳动。
    彩屯竖井的煤具有低磷、低硫、粘结性强三大特点，是炼焦的主煤。用它可以炼出优质的钢铁。矿井投入生产后，将比本溪现有斜井产煤量增加一倍以上。（本报辽宁记者站）
    十二月二十日，我国煤矿建设重点工程之一——抚顺老虎台矿扩建工程正式移交生产了。当天下午，在井下扩建区域崭新的井底车场剪彩以后，开始正式生产。
    古老的煤都，目前各大型矿井浅部煤田的煤正逐渐接近开采年限。今后若干年内，各矿井将向下延深，以便大规模地开采更丰富的深部煤田。老虎台矿扩建工程，是煤都开采深部煤田的第一个延深，扩建工程。抚顺建井的人们称它为大规模矿井建设的“前哨工程”。它只经过两年的建设，扩建区域每年就可生产一百多万吨煤。此项扩建工程因为利用了现有的井筒、向地面上运煤的设备和选煤场，所以它和大竖井比较，不但投资能减少三分之一，并能提早三、四年生产，供给国家急剧增长的工业用煤需要。　（据新华社讯）
