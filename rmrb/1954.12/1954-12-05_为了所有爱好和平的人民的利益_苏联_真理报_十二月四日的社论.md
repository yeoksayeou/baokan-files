For the Benefit of All Peace-Loving People
-- Soviet "Pravda" Editorial of December 4th

The meeting of representatives from eight countries – the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic , the Romanian People's Republic, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, and the People's of Albania, with an observer from the People's Republic of China participating, concluded on December 2nd. The historical significance of this meeting lies in its extremely clear illustration of the tasks facing all peace-loving people today. The declaration adopted by the meeting, which elucidates the fundamental issues in the current European situation, will be recorded in the history of modern international relations as an extremely important document.

More than thirty years ago, Lenin pointed out that old-style diplomacy "cannot believe that it is possible to speak frankly and openly." Even today, some Western politicians pretend not to understand the meaning of the clear and unambiguous statements made by the Soviet Union and the governments of the people's democracies. The initial comments in the reactionary foreign press regarding the meeting demonstrate that those advocating the revival of West German militarism are concentrating all their efforts on finding ways to diminish the importance of the meeting and distort the speeches of the participating representatives. However, the general public around the world now knows the worth of these tricks by Western politicians, and they clearly understand the great significance and weight of the diplomatic statements of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies.

The enthusiastic support of the general public and the newspapers of the people's democracies for the political line outlined in the meeting documents, as well as the deeply sympathetic comments made by democratic newspapers in capitalist countries, prove this point.

Today, the characteristic of the European situation is, first and foremost, that the ratification of the Paris Agreements, as pointed out in the declaration, will deepen the danger of war and threaten the national security of peace-loving European countries. At a time when the situation for resolving pressing international issues has improved, and at a time when opportunities have arisen for further easing world tensions, the ruling groups of some countries participating in the London and Paris Agreements have embarked on the dangerous path of reviving German militarism, disregarding the consequences of such steps.

Once the Paris Agreements are ratified, the armed forces of German revanchists, who can freely use atomic weapons, will dominate Western Europe. Everyone understands that the "guarantees" on paper, which aim to deceive public opinion, will not prevent the growth of German militarism, the establishment of a military dictatorship in West Germany, the suppression of democratic forces there, and the transformation of that part of Germany into a breeding ground for war.

The ratification of the Paris Agreements would be an action aimed at opposing the maintenance of peace, and it would mean preparing for war in Europe – this is the indisputable conclusion reached by the representatives participating in the European security conference, which must be supported by all peace-loving people.

It is precisely the arms dealers, the large monopoly capitalists of West Germany, and the major monopolies in the United States, Britain, and France that have close ties with them who need the Paris Agreements. The influence of capitalist monopoly groups, which in the past helped prepare and launch the Second World War, is growing within the U.S. government institutions. The Paris Agreements serve their interests precisely. As for the peace-loving peoples of all countries, they are concerned with strengthening peace and universal security. This is the policy pursued by the Soviet Union and the people's democracies.

The countries participating in the European conference to discuss guaranteeing European peace and security have a strong determination to continue to adhere to the establishment of a European collective security system. It is very clear that only the joint efforts of all European countries can lay the foundation for a lasting and consolidated peace in Europe. The representatives attending this meeting have announced that they are prepared to continue to cooperate with other European countries that are willing to follow this path. The struggle to establish a European collective security system will continue, and undoubtedly, the proposition of guaranteeing European peace through the joint efforts of all countries – regardless of their social systems – will gain more and more supporters throughout Europe.

Organizing European collective security and unifying Germany along peaceful and democratic lines is the way to guarantee Germany's development as a great power. Unlike the militarist path that Germany has taken in the past, which, as everyone knows, has led the German people to extremely painful consequences, the restoration of Germany's unity under the conditions of establishing European collective security will open up broad prospects for developing its peaceful economy and promoting large-scale economic relations with other countries, especially with the populous and resource-rich countries of Eastern Europe and Asia.

Regardless of how those who support the revival of German militarism try to use the differences in social systems as an excuse to justify the establishment of military blocs with West German militarists participating, increasingly broader public opinion in European countries has begun to realize that these words are just as hypocritical as those of the drafters of the "Anti-Comintern Pact," which included Hitler's Germany, fascist Italy, and militarist Japan. Everyone knows that the aggressive forces, which disguised themselves with the slogan of "defending against communism," used this pact as a tool to prepare for and launch the Second World War.

Only by establishing an all-European collective security system, rather than establishing narrow military blocs, can the true security of Europe be guaranteed. Either ratify the Paris Agreements, thereby causing the division of Europe and an arms race; or guarantee all-European security, thereby leading to peaceful cooperation between all European countries and the easing of world tensions.

There is no third solution. Everyone recognizes this today, and because of this, the attempts by the initiators of the European military alliance to escape this dilemma and deceive millions of people so that they do not know that the problem today is this and not that seem particularly crude and clumsy. The Soviet newspaper published the French government's reply to the Soviet government's notes of October 23rd and November 13th, which can be seen as an example of the ruling groups of Western European countries playing tricks, trying to make it seem as if the ratification of the Paris Agreements would not only not block the path to resolving outstanding European issues through negotiation, but would instead promote such a solution. However, evil deeds are always exposed. The establishment of a new military bloc in Europe is bound to have the negative consequence of further intensifying the tension in international relations, and it is impossible to hide this clear fact. It is also impossible to hide the fact that this action runs counter to the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 1944 and the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942, is incompatible with the international obligations undertaken under the Potsdam Agreement. There is also one more fact that cannot be hidden: this action will inevitably undermine trust in international relations and is irreconcilably contradictory to the security interests of the people of all European countries.

The advocates of a new military alliance between certain Western countries and the Bonn revanchists insist that after the Paris Agreements are ratified, nothing will change in Europe, and that it will even create favorable conditions for negotiations and the resolution of outstanding international issues. This sophistry has been thoroughly exposed by the European Conference Declaration.

This declaration points out that "the ratification of the Paris Agreements will greatly complicate the European situation and undermine the possibility of resolving outstanding European issues, especially the German question." The declaration further states, "The people of our countries know that the Paris Agreements greatly increase the threat of a new war. However, they will not allow themselves to be caught off guard by the development of events."

One cannot but agree with the conclusion made by Zhang Wentian, the representative of the People's Republic of China, in his speech, who said: We must pay close attention to the future development of the European situation and be fully prepared to deal with any possible sudden incidents.

Peace-loving countries have to take urgent measures to counter the aggressive forces of the Western countries' military bloc with the united strength of peace-loving countries to protect their own security.

The countries participating in this meeting have agreed that if the Paris Agreements are ratified, they will study the situation again in order to take all necessary measures to safeguard their security and maintain peace in Europe.

The countries participating in the meeting declared that they are determined to take joint measures in the organization of armed forces and command posts in the event that the Paris Agreements are ratified, and also to take other measures necessary to strengthen their national defense forces, to ensure the peaceful labor of their people, to ensure the inviolability of their borders, and to guarantee the repelling of possible aggression.

The entire Soviet people read with deep satisfaction the last few paragraphs of the declaration, which reflect their emotions, their thoughts, and their understanding of the essence of the current international situation:

"The people of our countries believe in their own strength - the source of their strength is inexhaustible. The forces of peace and socialism are now stronger than ever before, and more united than ever before. Any attempt to attack the people of the peaceful and socialist countries, any attempt to launch a war and disrupt their peaceful lives, will be met with a devastating counterattack. At that time, with the sympathy and support of the people of other countries, the people of our countries will do everything possible to eliminate the forces of aggression and strive for the victory of our just cause."

"The people of our countries are willing to live in peace and maintain friendly relations with the people of other countries. Precisely for this reason, they will continue to make unremitting efforts to defend the interests of peace and universal security, and will take all necessary measures to ensure the future peaceful development of their countries and the security they deserve."

Today's "Pravda" carries news of gatherings from all over the country, indicating the nation's genuine support for the declaration adopted by the meeting.

Workers in Moscow, Leningrad, and the Urals, construction workers of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Project, agricultural workers, collective farm members, scientists, engineers, office workers, and working people in Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and all other socialist republics that make up our powerful Soviet Union unanimously pointed out that the declaration is in line with the fundamental and vital interests of the Soviet people, and the Soviet people know how to defend these interests. The declaration is also in line with the interests of all peace-loving people. (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th, via TASS)

    为了所有爱好和平的人民的利益
    ——苏联“真理报”十二月四日的社论
    苏联、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国八国代表在中华人民共和国观察员参加下举行的会议，已经在十二月二日结束了。这个会议的历史意义在于它极其清楚地说明了今天所有爱好和平的人民面前的任务。会议通过的、阐明了目前欧洲局势中的根本问题的宣言将作为一个极其重要的文件载入现代国际关系史中。
    三十多年前，列宁曾经指出，旧式外交“不能相信坦白公开地说话是可能的”，甚至在今天，还有一些西方政客假装不懂苏联和人民民主国家政府的清楚的不含糊的声明的意义。反动的外国报纸对于会议的初步评论说明，复活西德军国主义的主张者正在集中全力想各种办法缩小会议的重要性，歪曲与会代表们的发言。但是全世界的一般公众现在知道西方政客们的这种把戏值多少钱，他们都清楚了解苏联和人民民主国家外交方面的声明的重大意义和分量。
    一般公众和人民民主国家报纸对会议文件中所列举的政治路线的热烈支持以及资本主义国家的民主报纸表示深切同情的评论证明了这一点。
    今天，欧洲局势的特点首先是：如宣言指出的，巴黎协定的批准将加深战争的危险，并且将威胁欧洲爱好和平国家的国家安全。正当解决迫切的国际问题的局势有了改善的时候，正当出现了进一步缓和世界紧张局势的机会的时候，一些参加伦敦和巴黎协定的国家的统治集团走上了复活德国军国主义的危险道路，而无视这种步骤的后果。
    一旦巴黎协定被批准了，可以随意使用原子武器的德国复仇主义者的武装部队就会统治西欧。每个人都明白：目的在于欺骗舆论的纸上“保证”将不会阻止德国军国主义的成长，不会阻止军事独裁在西德的建立，不会阻止对那里民主力量的镇压，而且也不会阻止把德国的那一部分变成战争的温床。
    批准巴黎协定将是一个目的在于反对维护和平的行动，它意味着要在欧洲准备战争——这是参加欧洲安全会议的代表们得出的、而且一定得到一切爱好和平的人民的支持的不可置辩的结论。
    正是军火商们、西德的大垄断资本以及和它们有着密切关系的美国、英国和法国的主要垄断资本才需要巴黎协定。在过去曾经帮助准备并且发动第二次世界大战的资本主义垄断集团在美国政府机构内的影响越来越大了。巴黎协定正是为它们的利益服务的。至于爱好和平的各国人民，他们所关心的是加强和平和普遍的安全。这是苏联和各人民民主国家所奉行的政策。
    参加讨论保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家会议的各国有坚强的决心要继续坚持建立一个欧洲集体安全体系。非常明显，只有一切欧洲国家的共同努力才能为欧洲的持久和巩固的和平奠定基础。出席这次会议的代表们已经宣布，他们准备继续和其他愿意走这条道路的欧洲国家合作。争取建立一个欧洲集体安全体系的斗争将继续下去，无疑的，通过一切国家——不管它们的社会制度如何——的共同努力来保障欧洲和平的主张将在欧洲各地取得越来越多的支持者。
    组织欧洲集体安全和按照和平和民主方针统一德国，是保证德国作为一个大国而发展的道路。同过去德国所走的、大家都知道已经把德国人民导向极其惨痛的后果的军国主义道路不同，在建立了欧洲集体安全的条件下恢复德国的统一，将为发展它的和平经济和促进它同其他国家间、尤其是同人口众多和资源丰富的东欧和亚洲的国家间的大规模经济关系展开宽阔的前景。
    不管复活德国军国主义的支持者们怎样竭力利用各国社会制度的不同作借口来为建立有西德军国主义分子参加的军事集团辩解，欧洲各国内越来越广泛的舆论已经开始认识到，这些话和包括希特勒德国、法西斯的意大利以及军国主义的日本在内的“反共产国际协定”的草拟人的话是一样地虚伪的。大家知道，用“防御共产主义”的说法来为自己掩饰的侵略势力曾利用这个协定作为准备和发动第二次世界大战的一个工具。
    只有建立了全欧集体安全体系而不是建立狭隘的军事集团，欧洲的真正安全才能得到保证。要么批准巴黎协定，从而引起欧洲的分裂和军备竞赛；要么保障全欧的安全，从而导致一切欧洲国家间的和平合作和世界紧张局势的缓和。
    没有第三个解决办法。今天人人都认识到这一点，而因为这样，欧洲军事联盟的发起人企图逃脱这个进退维谷的局面，想欺骗千百万人民，不让他们知道今天的问题是这样而不是那样的企图就显得特别粗暴和笨拙。苏联报纸刊载了法国政府对苏联政府十月二十三日和十一月十三日照会的覆照，这个照会可以被看作是一个实例，说明西欧国家统治集团在玩弄花样，想使事情看起来好像批准巴黎协定非但不会堵塞通过协商解决悬而未决的欧洲问题的道路，反而会促进这种解决似的。但是，恶事总是要败露的。在欧洲建立一个新的军事集团必然要产生使国际关系的紧张状态更形紧张的恶果，要隐瞒这个明白的事实是不可能的。这一行动同一九四四年的法苏同盟互助条约和一九四二年的英苏条约背道而驰，同在波茨坦协定下承担的国际义务不能相容，要隐瞒这一事实也是不可能的。还有一个事实也是隐瞒不了的：这一行动势将破坏国际关系上的信任，并且，同欧洲各国人民的安全利益存在着不可调和的矛盾。
    某些西方国家和波恩复仇主义者的新军事同盟的鼓吹者们硬说，在巴黎协定批准后，欧洲不会发生任何变化，甚至还将为谈判和解决悬而未决的国际问题创造有利的条件，这种强词夺理的说法已为欧洲会议宣言揭发无遗。
    这个宣言指出，“巴黎协定的批准将使欧洲局势大大复杂化，并且破坏解决悬而未决的欧洲问题、首先是解决德国问题的可能性。”宣言进一步说，“我们各国的人民知道：巴黎协定大大地增加了新战争的威胁。但是，他们不会让自己在事态的发展面前处于措手不及的境地。”
    人们也不能不同意中华人民共和国代表张闻天在他的发言中所作出的结论，他说：必须密切注意欧洲局势今后的发展，并充分准备着应付一切可能发生的突然事变。
    爱好和平的国家不得不采取迫切的措施，用爱好和平的国家联合起来的力量来对抗西方国家军事集团的侵略势力以保障自身的安全。
    参加这个会议的国家已经议定：如果巴黎协定被批准，它们将再度研究局势，以便采取一切必要的措施，来保障它们的安全和维持欧洲的和平。
  参加会议的国家宣布：它们有决心在巴黎协定竟然批准时在组织武装力量和司令部方面采取共同措施，并且还要采取加强它们国防力量所必需的其他措施，以保障它们人民的和平劳动，保证它们国境的不可侵犯性，保证击退可能发生的侵略。
    全体苏联人民以深为满意的心情阅读到宣言中最后这几段话，这些话反映着他们的情绪、他们的思想和他们对目前国际形势的实质的了解：
    “我们各国人民相信自己的力量——他们的力量无穷无尽的源泉。和平和社会主义的力量现在已经空前地强大，空前地团结一致。想进攻各和平和社会主义国家的人民，想发动战争和破坏他们的和平生活的任何企图都将遭到毁灭性的反击。那时，我们各国人民将在其他各国人民的同情和支持之下，竭尽所能去消灭侵略势力，争取我们的正义事业的胜利。”
      “我们各国人民愿意和其他各国人民和平相处并保持友好关系。正因为这样，他们将继续不断尽力捍卫和平和普遍安全的利益，并将采取一切必要的措施，以保证他们的国家今后的和平发展和他们本国应有的安全。”
    今天的“真理报”登载着全国各地集会的消息，这些集会表明全国真正拥护会议所通过的宣言。
    莫斯科、列宁格勒和乌拉尔的工人、古比雪夫水电工程的建筑工人、农业工人、集体农庄庄员、科学家、工程师、机关工作者和乌克兰、白俄罗斯、立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚以及其他组成我们强大的苏维埃联盟的一切社会主义共和国的劳动人民一致指出，这个宣言是符合苏联人民的根本的切身利益的，而苏联人民是懂得如何保卫这些利益的。这个宣言也是符合一切爱好和平的人民的利益的。　（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯）
