The tracks of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty Railway within Chinese territory were laid to Wuwei Station, 303 kilometers from Lanzhou, at 6:00 PM on December 1st. In recent days, three to four thousand people have visited the construction site daily, and the jubilant people of all ethnic groups in Wuwei are actively preparing for celebrations. In the future, crude oil and refined petroleum products produced by the Yumen Oil Mine will be loaded onto trains here and transported east, shortening the automobile transport distance by 114 kilometers compared to transshipment at Dachaigou. In addition, the abundant salt from the Yabulai Salt Lake in Alxa League, as well as grain, white hemp, and medicinal materials from Wuwei Prefecture, can also be loaded onto trains here and transported to various places.

The workers of the track-laying team who laid this section of track launched a production increase and economy campaign in October, increasing daily track-laying efficiency from 2.5 kilometers to 3 kilometers, with a maximum of 3.5 kilometers. Bridge-building workers also created a method of using small handcarts to move jacks, increasing the number of beam spans erected daily from 1.5 to 3.5. The workers now say that they will lay the tracks to Jiuba by the end of the year according to plan.

    兰新铁路已铺轨到武威
    兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路在中国境内的路轨，十二月一日下午六时已铺到距兰州三百零三公里的武威车站。这几天来，每天都有三、四千群众到工地参观访问，欢欣鼓舞的武威各族人民正在积极筹备庆祝。将来火车通到武威后，玉门油矿生产的原油和石油成品就要从这里装上火车东运，这比在打柴沟转运时又缩短了一百一十四公里的汽车运输路程。此外，阿拉善旗雅布赖盐池丰富的食盐和武威专区的粮食、白麻、药材等，也都可由这里装上火车运往各地。
    铺设这段路轨的钉道队的职工们，在十月份就展开了增产节约竞赛，每天铺轨效率由二公里半提高到三公里，最高达到三公里半。架桥工人也创造出利用小手车移动千斤顶的办法，由每天架一孔半梁提高到三孔半。职工们现在表示到年底一定要按计划把路轨铺到九坝。
