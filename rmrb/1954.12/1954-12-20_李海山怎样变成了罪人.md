Consolidating Labor Discipline, Safeguarding National Construction

Editor's Note: The following two reports about Li Haishan and Yu Baofa, who violated labor discipline and caused serious production accidents and were sentenced to imprisonment, reflect the serious situation of lax labor discipline in some enterprises, proving that failure to comply with labor discipline brings huge losses to the country. It is hoped that workers in various regions can learn from these two accidents, criticize Li Haishan and Yu Baofa's thoughts and behaviors, consolidate labor discipline in enterprises, and further promote China's socialist construction.

How Li Haishan Became a Sinner
By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming

The Wuhan People's Court recently tried the case of Li Haishan's serious violation of labor discipline and damage to machinery, and sentenced him to two years in prison.

Li Haishan is a 33-year-old operator of the scutcher in the Wuhan Joint State-Private Yuhua Cotton Mill. At the age of eight, he herded cattle for landlords. At the age of fourteen, he learned weaving for more than two years at the Wuchang Minsheng Cotton Mill. Later, he was laid off because the capitalists switched to female workers. He then pulled rickshaws, led horses, and drove horse carts until the People's Government organized horse cart workers to change careers after liberation. In January 1952, he entered the Yuhua Cotton Mill to work, ending his more than ten years of unstable cart-driving life. He himself felt that the "workers had truly turned over."

However, Li Haishan was contaminated with serious individualistic thoughts and hooligan habits in the old society. After entering the factory, he still did not abandon these dirty things. When he first entered the factory, he was assigned as a cotton mixer (ordinary worker) because he was not skilled, and he was dissatisfied, thinking that the old workers "looked down on him." Later, when he became more skilled and was promoted to a scutcher operator (technical worker), he thought he had "good skills," "strong abilities," "knew everything," and was "no worse than anyone else." When workers participated in political studies, he refused to participate. Sometimes, when he was forced to participate, he made trouble at group meetings. When the factory conducted safety technology education, he also refused to participate. Sometimes, when he was forced to participate, he muttered below, "What's the point of listening to this!" Whenever things didn't go his way, he complained, even cursed.

In order to help him overcome his individualistic ideological problems, the party, administrative, and trade union leaders in the workshop tried many ways to educate him individually. But he didn't listen at all. Instead, he mistakenly regarded the leadership's patient education as "helplessness" towards him, and became even more presumptuous, often acting like a hooligan and violating labor discipline. During working hours, he deliberately tied his hair up in a small braid, took off one sleeve of his clothes, and dragged his shoes, dressing himself as a "clown." Whoever tried to interfere with him, he would act even crazier.

His error eventually developed to the point where, relying on his "good skills" and "strong abilities," he deliberately failed to work according to operating procedures. As a result, he caused three accidents successively this year.

The first time was in April this year, when he was operating the new No. 1 scutcher. There was cotton hanging on the cotton roller, and according to regulations, he had to stop the machine to deal with it. However, he believed that stopping the machine would make it difficult for his machine utilization rate to reach 98%, affecting his bonus. He also wanted to show off his "skills" in front of others, so he deliberately reached into the running machine to grab the cotton. Carelessly, the sleeve of his cotton-padded jacket got caught, pulling his arm into the machine as well. He used force to tear off the entire sleeve, saving his arm. He was afraid that this matter would "be known and he would lose face," so he secretly hid the torn cotton-padded jacket in the cabinet, pretending nothing had happened. This sleeve that was rolled into the machine went all the way from the scutcher to the lap former. Later, the lap former workers discovered many rags and old cotton in the cotton lap and immediately reported it to the administrator for investigation. His torn cotton-padded jacket was found in the cabinet, and he confessed his mistake reluctantly. After this accident, the group meeting severely criticized him, and the administration recorded a demerit in his "Safety Production Record Handbook." He himself also made a self-criticism.

However, after a few days, he forgot the lesson of this accident. On the afternoon of July 26, he failed to implement the shift handover system and took over the shift carelessly. At the same time, he did not do a good job of cleaning during the shift, causing a place on the No. 2 scutcher to be blocked by cotton, causing friction and fire. Fortunately, the workers discovered it in time and quickly extinguished it.

Immediately afterwards, on the afternoon of August 15 – these were the most tense days of flood prevention for the people of Wuhan – he found cotton hanging on the dust bar of the No. 2 scutcher. He did not use a brush to remove it as required, but casually used a bamboo hook to hook it. As a result, he stuck the bamboo hook between the dust bar and the cotton feeding roller. It was immediately broken by the "beater," and an explosion sounded. The machine was severely damaged. At that time, he still refused to frankly admit his mistake and tried to shirk responsibility in a stuttering manner. Later, the workers found the broken bamboo hook from the machine, and he was forced to admit it. This accident damaged more than 40 parts of a scutcher. The 15,000 spindles supplied by this scutcher stopped production for 35.8 hours, reducing cotton yarn production by 82.395 pieces, causing a loss of more than 290 million yuan to the country.

Regarding Li Haishan's accident, the Wuhan People's Procuratorate filed a public prosecution, and the Wuhan People's Court conducted a public trial at the Yuhua Cotton Mill on September 26. The presiding judge announced that Li Haishan was guilty of dereliction of duty and caused significant losses to the country, and sentenced him to two years in prison in accordance with the law.

Li Haishan's case educated the cadres and workers of the factory. The factory leadership reviewed that although they had done a lot of work in labor discipline and safety production in the past, they had not done it meticulously and deeply enough. At the same time, they often thought that those who repeatedly refused to be educated had "good components" and took a laissez-faire and accommodating attitude, failing to strictly enforce discipline. The factory immediately rectified the four management systems related to safety production and determined methods for deepening work in the future. The workers also expressed that they must strictly abide by operating procedures and work systems in the future. Li Youshan and Yuan Gusheng, who originally did not work according to operating procedures, corrected their shortcomings. The grassroots workshop cadres also earnestly took responsibility for technical management. Accidents in the scutching workshop decreased from eleven in August to four in September.

The correct handling of this case also educated Li Haishan himself. He began to calm down and consider his problems: "I was originally a worker. But now others are doing their jobs as usual, but I have become a criminal. Why is that..." He initially felt that it was individualism and pride that harmed him. He had failed to study for a long time, so he forgot who he was working for. He also felt that the losses he had caused to the country were too great, and the People's Government's sentence of two years in prison was still lenient towards him. He was determined to temper himself in labor reform and become a new person.

    李海山怎样变成了罪人
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    武汉市人民法院不久前审理了李海山严重破坏劳动纪律损坏机器的案件，判处他两年徒刑。
    李海山是武汉市公私合营裕华纱厂清花机的值车工，今年三十三岁。他八岁给地主放牛，十四岁进武昌民生纱厂学了两年多织布工，后来因为资本家改用女工被解雇，便拉人力车、牵马、赶马车，直到解放后人民政府组织马车工人转业，在一九五二年一月进裕华纱厂做工，才结束了十多年来不安定的赶车生涯。他自己也感到真是“工人翻了身”。
    但是，李海山在旧社会里沾染了严重的个人主义思想和流氓习气，进入工厂后，他仍然没有抛弃这些肮脏东西。他刚进厂时，因为技术不熟练，被分配为和花工（普通工），他就不满，认为是老工人“看不起他”。后来技术比较熟练了，升为清花机值车工（技术工人），他又认为自己“技术好”、“能力强”、“什么事都懂”，“比谁都不差”。工人进行政治学习，他不肯参加，有时勉强参加了，便在小组会上捣乱。工厂进行安全技术教育，他也不肯参加，有时勉强参加了，就在下面叽咕：“这有什么听头！”凡事一不顺他的意，他就发牢骚，甚至谩骂。
    为了帮助他克服个人主义的思想毛病，车间党、行政、工会负责人都想了许多办法，对他进行个别教育。但是他根本不听。反把领导上的耐心教育错误地看成是对他“没办法”，因而越发放肆起来，经常耍流氓态度，破坏劳动纪律。在工作时间里，他故意将头发往上束成一个小辫，将衣服脱掉一只袖子，倒拖着鞋，把自己打扮成“三花脸”。谁要去干涉他，他就越装疯。
    他这种错误最后竟发展到自持“技术好”、“能力强”，故意不按操作规程工作。结果在今年先后造成三次事故。
    第一次是今年四月，他在新一号清花机值车，出棉罗拉上挂有棉花，按规定必须停车处理，但他认为一停车处理就使自己的机器运转率很难达到百分之九十八，影响自己的奖金；并想在人面前显示显示自己的“技术”，就故意伸手到运转着的机器上去抓棉花。一不小心，棉袄袖子却被卷住了，把他的手臂也往机器里拉。他用劲将整个袖子撕掉，才保全了手臂。他怕这事“被人知道了，面子上过不去”，便偷偷的将撕破了的棉袄藏到柜子里，装个没事人儿。这只被卷进机器的袖子，由清花机一直转到成卷机上去了。成卷工人后来发现棉卷上有许多破布和旧棉花，立即报告管理员清查，从柜子里找出他的破棉袄来，他才吞吞吐吐地承认了自己的错误。在这次事故后，小组会对他进行了严厉的批评，行政上在他的“安全生产纪事手册”上记了一过，他自己也作了检讨。
    但是，过些日子，他又忘掉了这次事故的教训。七月二十六日下午，他不执行交接班制度，马马虎虎将班接了，同时在班上不认真作清洁工作，使二号清花机的一个地方被棉花塞死，磨擦起火，幸经工人们及时发觉，才迅速扑灭。
    紧接着在八月十五日下午，——这是武汉人民防汛最紧张的日子，他发现二号清花机尘棒上挂有棉花，也不按规定用毛刷去清除，却顺手用竹钩去钩。结果将竹钩塞进了尘棒与给棉罗拉之间，立即被“打手”击断，响起了爆炸声，机器被严重损坏了。他当时仍不肯坦白承认错误，支支吾吾的企图推脱责任，后来工人们从机器里找出断了的竹钩来，他才被迫承认。这次事故使一部清花机被损坏了四十多处，由这部清花机供应的一万五千纱锭停止了三十五点八小时生产，减产棉纱八十二点三九五件，给国家造成两亿九千多万元的损失。
    对李海山这次事故，武汉市人民检察署提起了公诉，武汉市人民法院九月二十六日在裕华纱厂进行公判，由审判长宣布李海山玩忽职守，给国家造成重大损失，依法判处他两年徒刑。
    李海山的案件教育了该厂的干部与工人。该厂领导上检查了过去虽然在劳动纪律与安全生产等方面作了不少工作，但作得不够细致和深入，同时对屡教不改的分子常以为“成份好”，而采取姑息迁就的态度，没有严格执行纪律。该厂立即整顿了有关安全生产的四项管理制度，同时确定了今后深入工作的办法。工人们也都表示今后一定要严格遵守操作规程和工作制度。原来不大按操作规程工作的工人李幼山、袁谷生，都改正了自己的毛病。车间基层干部在技术管理上也认真负起责来。清花车间的事故，就由八月十一次降到九月份四次。
    这个案件的正确处理，也教育了李海山本人。他开始冷静下来考虑自己的毛病：“我原本是一个工人。但现在别人照常做工，我却成了罪犯，这是为什么呢……”他初步感到就是个人主义、骄傲自满害了自己，长期不学习，以致忘掉了自己工作是为了谁。他也觉得自己给国家造成的损失太大了，人民政府判处他两年徒刑也还是对他宽大处理，他决心要在劳动改造中锻炼自己，重新做人。
