Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 10th: The Chinese Cultural Delegation, invited by the Indian government to visit India, held its first performance at the "Joy Theatre" in Delhi at 7 pm on the 9th. The Chinese and Indian national flags were hung on the front of the theater. Many enthusiastic Indian people stood in the square in front of the theater to welcome the Chinese artists.

Those present at the performance included: Indian President Prasad, Prime Minister Nehru, senior Indian government officials, members of parliament, prominent public figures, well-known literary and art workers, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to India.

Shen Jian, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in India, also attended the performance.

Mrs. Indira Gandhi, Chairman of the Indian Central Reception Committee for the Chinese Cultural Delegation, delivered a welcoming speech before the performance. She said: Not only the people of Delhi are eagerly looking forward to this visit, but also the people of other Indian cities that the delegation will visit. However, due to the urgency of time, it is impossible to include these cities in the itinerary. She said that we are very pleased to see the re-establishment of the old ties between our two great countries. The leaders of our two countries have met and pointed out the path for us. Even more significant is that the people of our two countries have begun to have closer contact and mutual understanding. We hope that this situation will continue and strengthen the long-standing friendship between our two countries and peoples.

Zheng Zhenduo, head of the Chinese Cultural Delegation, delivered a reply. He said that China and India have been conducting cultural exchanges in an atmosphere of peace and friendship for more than two thousand years. In modern times, the people of our two countries have forged even closer ties in the struggle against foreign aggression and for freedom and independence.

Zheng Zhenduo pointed out that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong's principle of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, weed through the old to bring forth the new," the arts of all ethnic groups in China have begun to flourish, mutually enriching and developing.

Zheng Zhenduo expressed that the Chinese Cultural Delegation hopes to exchange experiences with the Indian art community and sincerely learn from Indian art.

Zheng Zhenduo concluded: Under the light of friendship, culture, and peace, the increasingly frequent cultural exchanges between China and India will play a huge and positive role in the further development of Eastern culture.

The Chinese Cultural Delegation performed a total of fourteen programs: in chorus and solo singing, there were "China-India Friendship Song," "India-China Friendship Song" (Hindi song), and the folk song "Driving the Horse Cart"; in instrumental music, there was a Guqin and Xiao ensemble; in dance, there were "Grandfather Carrying Grandson," "Lotus Dance," and "Picking Tea and Chasing Butterflies"; in classical opera, there were "Havoc in Heaven," "Eliminating Three Evils," and "Stealing the Immortal Herb." These programs were universally appreciated and welcomed by the Indian audience, who applauded enthusiastically again and again.

During the intermission, President Prasad presented a flower basket to Head Zheng Zhenduo to congratulate him. At the end of the performance, when all the actors took a bow, Prime Minister Nehru and Mrs. Indira Gandhi distributed flower baskets and piles of bouquets to the actors.

After the performance, R.K. Nehru, Secretary of External Affairs of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, hosted a banquet to entertain the members of the Chinese Cultural Delegation. About one hundred people attended, including Mrs. Indira Gandhi, senior Indian government officials, and literary and art workers.

    郑振铎表示，中国文化代表团希望和印度艺术界交流经验，并诚恳地向印度的艺术学习。
    郑振铎最后说：在友谊、文化和和平之光的照耀下，中印两国之间日益频繁的文化交流将会对东方文化的进一步发展起巨大的和积极的作用。
