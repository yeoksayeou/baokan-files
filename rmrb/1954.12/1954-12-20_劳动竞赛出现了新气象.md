Title: New Developments in the Labor Emulation Drive

As the Vice-Chairman of the Anshan Iron and Steel Works Medium Plate Factory Trade Union, I believe that mobilizing all employees to carry out labor emulation drives to ensure the comprehensive fulfillment and over-fulfillment of national plans is the primary responsibility of the trade union. However, in the past, our factory's labor emulation drives never went well. It was not until the implementation of the "team-based cost accounting" system in April of this year (see "From Deficit to Surplus" in this issue—Editor) that new developments emerged in the labor emulation drive.

For example, in the past, our competition conditions only had one concrete target – the monthly output of steel plates. Other conditions, such as ensuring quality and abiding by labor discipline, were just empty slogans. Only after calculating the total account at the end of the month did we know which aspects of quality, cost, etc., were completed and which were not. If some workshops failed to meet certain targets, it was too late to salvage the situation.

Because we didn't know the specific daily targets, we couldn't check each worker's competition performance. Whenever it came to the monthly evaluation, we could only use a layer-by-layer "picking the tallest" method. Individuals were evaluated based solely on group support or a show of hands. Groups were selected by workshop Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres, and then reported to the factory trade union. At this point, the factory trade union faced even greater difficulties. They ran around all day trying to find materials, but they couldn't. They simply chose whoever had the highest output, regardless of other conditions. This evaluation process took one month and twenty days, and the results were not entirely reasonable.

Now, things are different. Competition bulletin boards have been set up at each worksite, and the first thing workers do every day is check the bulletin board to see how they did yesterday. The three shifts compete for the red banner every day, and each shift strives to fully complete the plan. The competition is becoming increasingly heated, and almost all workers are participating. Unlike in the past, when those who didn't work hard were not noticeable, and only a few people took the lead, now it is different. Evaluating the competition results is also easier. Because the bulletin board publishes daily how each shift is performing, everyone knows which shift is the winner without evaluation at the end of the month. The trade union can announce the competition results in less than five days each month, and everyone agrees.

In the past, we also implemented a production meeting system, but it was never effective. Because the meetings covered everything, all issues were discussed, but none were discussed in detail. Criticism and self-criticism were not carried out effectively, and the resolutions made could not solve the key problems in production. Now, in addition to the monthly workshop production meetings and weekly group production meetings that discuss larger issues, each shift holds short meetings of ten to fifteen minutes before and after each shift to discuss and check the day's production, criticize the bad, praise the good, and study improvement methods. The meeting content is specific, and it addresses the key issues in each shift's production. These daily meetings, held by every shift, lead to continuous improvement, advanced experiences, and important rationalization proposals. Shortcomings in the leadership methods of team leaders and workshop directors, problems with some workers' work attitudes, violations of operating procedures, and localism committed by the current shift or other shifts can all be corrected at any time.

The work of promoting advanced experiences is also different from the past. In the past, we often couldn't find advanced experiences. Even when we did, it was not easy to summarize and promote them, and they lacked strong persuasive power. Now, by looking at the records, we can identify the advanced experiences of those who had the best quality during a given period and trace the reasons for ensuring quality. By seeing who had the fewest accidents, we can find the advanced experiences of ensuring safe production. And when we summarize and promote these experiences, everyone is convinced because there are concrete figures to prove it. Using this method, in the past six months or so, we have summarized and promoted the experience of Team B in improving the recovery rate, Zhang Haiyou's fast and safe standard steel rolling method, and Jin Lianxing's consistent adherence to operating procedures, which have greatly contributed to production. At the same time, the records also show which teams have the worst performance, and the trade union can go to those teams to help them find the reasons and solve the problems.

Through team-based accounting, the connection between workers and staff has also been strengthened. In the past, the trade union always called on staff to face the workshops and serve the workshops, but even the trade union didn't know how to serve them. Now, staff regularly go to the workshops during and after work to explain the significance of accounting to the workers and analyze the performance of each shift in terms of each indicator. If they are too busy to go sometimes, or if the numbers are filled in incorrectly, the workers will come to the office to find them and study improvements together.

The implementation of team-based accounting has also established a normal order in the relationship between the trade union and the administration. In the past, the administration announced the planned tasks, and the trade union mobilized employees to carry out labor emulation drives. But the competitions ended after only a few days and could not effectively guarantee the completion of the tasks. Now, the administrative plan targets are the same targets that the trade union uses to lead the masses in competition. When the administration decides to strengthen technical management to ensure the completion of the plan, the trade union organizes workers to implement operating procedures to ensure the completion of the plan. In this way, the cooperation between the trade union and the administration has naturally become closer.

Of course, there are still many shortcomings in our work. For example, due to our lack of a strong overall national perspective, the competition at one time neglected product variety targets, which affected the timely completion of orders from some fraternal factories. The competition is not comprehensive enough, and many technicians and staff have not participated. We are working hard to improve these shortcomings.

    劳动竞赛出现了新气象
    鞍钢中板厂工会副主席　唐德元
    发动全体职工开展劳动竞赛，保证全面完成和超额完成国家计划，是工会的主要责任。但是过去我们厂的劳动竞赛总搞不好，一直到今年四月工厂里实行“班组节约核算”制后（见本版“从亏累变成有盈余”—编者），劳动竞赛才出现了新的情况。
    比如说吧，过去我们竞赛条件中只有一个产量——一个月出多少钢板，是具体的，其他条件像保证质量啦，遵守劳动纪律啦，光是些空洞的口号，只有到月底算出总账来以后，才知道质量、成本……等等哪样完成了，哪样没完成。如果有的车间有的指标没完成，这时候想挽救也来不及了。
    因为不知道每天的具体指标，所以也没法检查每个工人的竞赛成绩。每逢到月末评比时，只好用一层一层“拔大个”的办法，评个人时只凭小组口喊拥护或举手表决，评小组时只凭车间党政工团干部选拔，然后统一报到厂工会。这时厂工会更困难了，整天东跑西跑找材料也找不来，只好谁产量多就谁好，其他条件不管了。这样评一回就得耗费一个月二十天。评的也不完全合理。
    现在就不同了。各个现场都设立了竞赛图板，工人们每天上班头一件事就是到图板前边看看昨天干得怎么样。三个班天天夺红旗，班班都要全面完成计划，竞赛越来越热烈，几乎全体工人都参加了竞赛，不像过去谁不使劲也显不出来，竞赛光有少数人带头。评比竞赛结果也省了事。因为图板上每天都公布哪一班完成得怎样，到月末不用评大伙就知道哪个班优胜了。每月不到五号，工会就能公布竞赛结果，大伙也没有意见。
    过去我们也推行了生产会议的制度，但是老开不好。因为会议包罗万象，什么问题也讨论，可是什么问题也讨论不具体，批评和自我批评也展不开，做出决议也不能解决生产上的关键问题。现在除了每月的车间生产会议和每星期的小组生产会议研究一些比较大的问题之外，每个班每天接班前交班后都开十几分钟的小会，讨论检查当天的生产，批评坏的，表扬好的，研究改进办法。会议内容具体，解决的都是各班生产中的关键问题。这样天天开，班班开，开完了就改进，日积月累，就出来了先进经验，也出来了重要的合理化建议。班组长和车间主任的领导方法有缺点，有些工人的劳动态度有毛病，不遵守操作规程，本班或别班犯了本位主义，也都能随时得到纠正。
    推广先进经验的工作也和过去不一样了。过去我们老找不到先进经验，有时候找到了，总结出来也不易推广，没有很大的说服力量。现在一看记录，这个时期谁的质量最好，就能顺着这条线找出保证质量的先进经验。看谁的事故最少，就能找出保证安全生产的先进经验。而且总结出来推广，大伙都信服，因为有具体的数字在那摆着。用这种办法，在这半年多中间，我们总结和推广了乙班提高收得率的经验，张海有的快速安全标准轧钢法，和金连兴一贯遵守操作规程等经验，对生产起了很大的作用。同时，从记录上也可以看出来哪个班成绩最差，工会就可以深入到哪个班去帮助他们找原因、解决问题。
    通过班组核算，也把工人和职员联系起来了。过去工会老是号召职员要面向车间，为车间服务，可是究竟怎样服务法，连工会也不了解。现在职员经常到车间去利用上下班时间给工人讲核算的意义，分析各班各个指标完成得好坏；假如有时忙了没去，或数字填错了，工人就到办公室来找，一起研究改进。
    实行班组核算，在工会和行政的关系上也建立了正常的秩序。过去行政上宣布计划任务，工会就发动职工开展劳动竞赛。可是赛不几天就完了，不能有力地保证任务的完成。现在，行政的计划指标就是工会领导群众竞赛的指标；行政上决定加强技术管理来保证完成计划，工会就组织工人贯彻操作规程来保证完成计划。这样，工会和行政的配合就自然密切了。
    当然，我们的工作中也还有不少缺点。例如由于我们缺乏强烈的国家整体观念，有一个时期的竞赛忽视了品种指标，影响了某些兄弟工厂的订货没有按时完成；竞赛开展得不全面，还有不少技术人员和职员没有参加进来。这些缺点我们都正在努力设法改进。
