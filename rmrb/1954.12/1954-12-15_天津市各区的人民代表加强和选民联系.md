People's representatives from various districts in Tianjin Municipality have strengthened their ties with voters after studying the "Organic Law of the People's Republic of China on Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels." People's representatives from Shenyang Road, Jinzhou Road, Henan Road, and other streets in the First District have recently held voter symposiums and established a system of regular contact with voters. Forty-three representatives of the Fourth District People's Congress, based on the different circumstances of the voters, adopted methods such as report meetings, symposiums, key visits, setting up reception stations and mailboxes to maintain close contact with the general public. Through these contacts, the representatives were able to understand the people's opinions and demands in a timely manner. In more than a month, the forty-three people's representatives in the Fourth District received a total of one hundred and fifty-nine opinions from the people, including fifty-nine critical suggestions on improving production and saving resources. People's representatives from the Xushui Pool Street in the Seventh District recently received six suggestions related to the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises and the safe production of private factories.

In their contact with voters, people's representatives pay attention to publicizing the state's policies. After the people's representatives of the state-owned Tianjin First Cotton Textile Factory publicized the significance of saving raw cotton to the workers, the workers in the cleaning workshop strengthened the work of picking cotton seeds and improved the quality of cotton yarn. Liu Pinfang, a people's representative of the Fourth District, carried out propaganda on the general task in light of the ideological situation of the residents of Jin-Tang Highway Street, reversing the thinking of more than a dozen households who simply relied on the government, and they automatically found ways to repair the dangerous houses.

    天津市各区的人民代表加强和选民联系
    天津市内各区人民代表大会代表学习“中华人民共和国地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法”以后，加强了和选民的联系。一区沈阳道、锦州道、河南路等街道上的人民代表，都在最近分别召开了选民座谈会，订立了定期联系选民的制度。四区的四十三名区人民代表大会代表根据选民不同的情况，采用了报告会、座谈会、重点访问、设接待站和信箱等方法，和广大人民保持了密切联系。通过这些联系，代表们及时了解了人民的意见和要求。四区四十三名人民代表在一个多月中共收到人民提出的意见一百五十九件，其中有五十九件是关于改进生产和节约的批评建议。七区蓄水池街的人民代表最近收到六件有关私营工商业的社会主义改造和私营工厂安全生产的建议。
    人民代表在和选民联系中，注意宣传国家的政策。国营天津第一棉纺织厂的人民代表向工人宣传节约原棉的意义后，清花车间工人加强了拣棉籽的工作，提高了棉纱质量。四区人民代表刘品芳针对津塘公路街居民的思想情况进行总任务的宣传，扭转了十多户居民单纯依赖政府的思想，自动设法整修了危险的房屋。　（新华社）
