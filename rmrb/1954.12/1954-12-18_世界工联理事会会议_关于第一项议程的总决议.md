    The World Federation of Trade Unions Council, after studying the current international situation, notes that war forces have recently been intensifying their efforts to completely undo the victories achieved by peace-loving people in their struggle to ease international tensions and eliminate hotbeds of war.
    In Europe, the governments of the United States, Great Britain, France, West Germany, and other countries have signed the Paris Agreements, which aim to transform West Germany into a military state and incorporate it into aggressive military blocs. The Paris Agreements threaten peace and security in Europe. They divide Europe into hostile blocs, thereby increasing the threat of a devastating atomic war.
    In Asia, the American warmongering clique is attempting to instigate another war, pitting the peoples of various countries on the continent against each other and suppressing national liberation movements. To achieve this goal, the American warmongering clique has established aggressive military blocs, concluded the Manila Treaty (Southeast Asia Treaty), continues to occupy Taiwan, and has also signed a military alliance treaty with the heinous Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang (whose piratical activities are supported by the American warmongering clique). This policy is also being extended to colonial and semi-colonial countries. At a time when disarmament and the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction have become practically possible (as evidenced by the United Nations' discussions on this issue), this policy is stimulating the arms race.
    This aggressive policy, with its increase in armed forces and military spending, is a heavy burden on the people, and constantly threatens the living standards of the working people. This policy relies on increasingly brutal repression. The implementation of this policy brings all kinds of infringements on the democratic rights of the working people and their trade union organizations. In colonial and semi-colonial countries, imperialists are doing everything possible to suppress the struggle of the peoples of all countries for freedom and national independence.
    The Council particularly emphasizes that there is another path, diametrically opposed to this policy, as the recent Moscow European Conference of European countries on safeguarding peace and security in Europe has once again demonstrated. This is a path of resolving international disputes through consultation, first and foremost the German question, a path of organizing collective security, thereby leading to universal, supervised disarmament, broad satisfaction of the demands of the working people, and welfare and social progress.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions Council believes that, in the current international situation, the struggle for peace in Europe, Asia, and the whole world is the main and urgent task of the working people of all countries.
    From this point of view, the World Federation of Trade Unions Council recommends that trade union organizations:
    Organize workers to take broad, united offensive action to oppose the Paris Agreements, oppose the revival of German militarism, and strive for consultation, collective security, disarmament, and peace;
    Call on workers and their trade union organizations to more actively support the measures and movements of the world peace movement, and to become the most enthusiastic supporters of these measures and movements;
    Call on workers and their trade union organizations to fully support the World Peace Congress to be held in 1955, and to guarantee the success of the congress.
    The Council emphasizes that the struggle for peace and collective security, against the establishment of military blocs, against the arms race and economic militarization, is inextricably linked to the struggle for national independence and for the improvement of the living conditions of the broad masses of working people. The working people are increasingly aware of this.
    Monopoly capitalists, in order to prepare for war, are intensifying the exploitation of the working people. In capitalist and colonial countries, real wages are constantly declining, and therefore cannot guarantee workers and their families a decent standard of living. In order to obstruct and divert the workers' struggle to raise wages, monopoly capitalists are trying to rigidly link wage increases with increased productivity. In reality, the "increased productivity" movement is a facade to disguise a series of methods of intensifying labor intensity that damage workers' energy and physical strength. The methods of the monopoly capitalists increase the number of work accidents and cause an increase in layoffs and unemployment. The main purpose of these methods is to maximize the profits of large enterprises in capitalist and colonial countries.
    On the issue of wages, the World Federation of Trade Unions Council firmly opposes all measures by capitalist countries that attempt to rigidly link wage increases with increased productivity. The Council believes that if workers use their struggle to force the monopoly capitalists to take money from their huge profits to increase wages and force the government to cut military spending, it is possible to increase wages without causing price increases. It emphasizes that the working people need to increase wages also because this will promote the expansion of the domestic market, because this is necessary for the welfare of the broad masses.
    In studying the economic and social situation in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries, the World Federation of Trade Unions Council noted the continuous development of peaceful production. On this basis, the material and cultural living standards of the people are constantly improving.
    The countries of the socialist camp have implemented a policy of systematically reducing consumer prices and are carrying out large-scale construction of housing, schools, hospitals, theaters, sports fields, and other public welfare facilities.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions Council affirms that the working people of capitalist and colonial countries have responded to the attacks of the reactionaries with a new upsurge in the struggle for peace, for higher living standards, and for the expansion of democratic rights and social welfare. Large-scale mass strikes have taken place in Great Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, India, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Honduras, and other countries.
    These strikes prove that workers are unwilling to allow their living conditions to deteriorate, and are unwilling to allow their trade union rights and democratic rights to be infringed.
    The heroic struggle of the working people under the slogan of unity and the international solidarity of the workers have made it impossible for the governments and monopoly capital of some countries to implement their anti-labor measures, and have made it possible for many leaders of the workers' movement to be released from prison.
    From this point of view, the Council requests all trade union organizations to tirelessly expose the hidden purposes of the plans to increase productivity and industrial concentration, and to expand the united action of the working people on a broader scale:
    Striving to universally increase the purchasing power of their wages, with due consideration for the special circumstances of each country, each industry, each trade, and each factory and mining enterprise;
    Striving to establish guaranteed minimum wages through agreements or legislation, and ensuring the achievement of satisfactory living conditions in each country;
    Striving to increase the wages of female workers; the Council believes that it is necessary to convene an international female workers' conference to study the methods that should be adopted by the mass movement in various countries to achieve the principle of "equal pay for equal work"; the preparatory work for this conference should be carried out with the broad support of national trade unions in various countries;
    Striving to increase the wages of child labor by implementing the principle of "equal pay for equal work";
    Opposing the strengthening of labor intensity, the speed-up system, and other methods of excessive exploitation; in order to promote this movement, the World Federation of Trade Unions plans to conduct a broad international investigation into the excessive exploitation in capitalist and colonial countries in 1955;
    Striving to shorten the work week without reducing wages;
    Striving to adjust the limits of the working day for agricultural workers, especially agricultural workers in colonial and semi-colonial countries;
    Striving to implement and improve the social insurance system;
    Striving to implement and improve the paid leave system.
    The Council emphasizes that the key to victory for the laboring masses in the struggle for peace and to safeguard their social and economic demands lies in strengthening united action among trade union organizations of various tendencies and united action among workers holding different political views and belonging to different trade unions, especially strengthening solidarity from below in factories.
    Since the end of the Third World Trade Union Congress, the efforts of the working masses to strive for unity have further increased. For example, the trade unions in West Germany almost unanimously passed a resolution opposing the establishment of a new Bundeswehr, opposing the incorporation of West Germany into military alliances, opposing any action to re-militarize West Germany, and demanding a solution to the German question through consultation.
    In Great Britain, the voting of trade union organizations at the Trades Union Congress showed that the vast majority of British workers are opposed to the revival of German militarism.
    On the other hand, the workers of the trade unions belonging to the World Federation of Trade Unions and the members of the trade unions belonging to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions have taken many joint actions to defend their demands.
    These examples vividly prove that it is possible for the working people to achieve united action, whether in the struggle for peace or in the struggle to realize their demands.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions Council calls on all trade union organizations to make greater efforts to realize the international trade union unity. The resolution of the Third World Trade Union Congress emphasized that rebuilding this unity will have great significance for the workers. The World Federation of Trade Unions Council declares that international trade union unity can only be expanded if everyone gives play to practical initiative aimed at strengthening international worker solidarity.
    In 1955, the World Federation of Trade Unions will be ten years old. In order to commemorate this year, workers from various countries should send delegations to each other on a larger scale, and direct contact should be established between trade union organizations and workers in various factories and mining enterprises, which will effectively strengthen international worker solidarity.
    Therefore, the World Federation of Trade Unions Council calls on all trade union organizations (regardless of whether they belong to the World Federation of Trade Unions) to give play to all aspects of their initiative to strengthen and expand the unity of the working class at home and abroad. Only in this way can the workers achieve decisive victory in the struggle for peaceful coexistence among all countries, for international economic and cultural cooperation, for improving the living standards of the laboring masses, and for happiness, freedom, and peace.

### 世界工联理事会会议  关于第一项议程的总决议

    世界工联理事会会议
    关于第一项议程的总决议
    世界工会联合会理事会研究了目前的国际形势以后注意到：战争势力最近已经在加紧努力来使爱好和平的人民在争取缓和国际紧张局势和消除战争温床的斗争中所取得的胜利完全消失。
    在欧洲，美国、英国、法国、西德和其他一些国家的政府已经签订了目的在于把西德变成一个军事国家和使它参加侵略性的军事集团的巴黎协定。巴黎协定威胁着欧洲的和平和安全。它把欧洲分裂成为一些敌对的集团，从而增加了毁灭性的原子战争的威胁。
    在亚洲，美国好战集团正在企图煽动另一次战争，使这个大陆上的各国人民互相敌对，并且镇压民族解放运动。为了达到这个目的，美国好战集团建立了一些侵略性的军事集团，缔结了马尼拉条约
  （东南亚条约），继续占领着台湾，并且还和万恶的蒋介石匪帮（这个匪帮的海盗行为得到美国好战集团的支持）签订了一个军事同盟条约。这个政策也扩大到殖民地和半殖民地的国家中去。正当裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器有了实际可能的时候
  （正如联合国关于这个问题的讨论所证明的），这个政策刺激了军备竞赛。
    这个侵略政策使武装部队和军事开支增加，这对人民是一个沉重的负担，使劳动人民的生活水平经常受到威胁。这个政策是以越来越残酷的镇压为依靠的。这个政策的实行带来了对劳动人民和他们的工会组织的民主权利的各种侵犯。在殖民地和半殖民地国家，帝国主义者千方百计地企图镇压各国人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争。
    理事会特别着重指出，另外有一条和这个政策截然相反的道路，正如最近讨论保障欧洲和平和安全的莫斯科欧洲国家会议再度表明的，这是一条通过协商解决国际分歧、首先是解决德国问题的道路，是一条组织集体安全，从而导向普遍的、有监督的裁减军备、广泛满足劳动人民的要求和导向福利和社会进步的道路。
    世界工会联合会理事会认为，在目前的国际形势下，为争取欧洲、亚洲和全世界的和平而斗争是各国劳动人民的主要的和迫切的任务。
    从这一点出发，世界工会联合会理事会建议各工会组织：
    组织工人采取广泛的、一致的攻势行动，来反对巴黎协定，反对复活德国军国主义，争取协商、集体安全、裁减军备和和平；
    号召工人和他们的工会组织更加积极地支持世界和平运动的措施和运动，并且成为这些措施和运动的最热心的支持者；
    号召工人和他们的工会组织充分支持在一九五五年召开的世界和平大会，并且保证大会的胜利。
    理事会强调指出，争取和平和集体安全、反对建立军事集团、反对军备竞赛和经济军事化的斗争，是同争取民族独立、争取广大劳动群众生活条件的改善的斗争不可分割地联系着的。劳动人民越来越认清这一点了。
    垄断资本家为了准备战争，就加紧剥削劳动人民。在资本主义国家和殖民地国家中，实际工资正在不断下降，因而不能保证工人和他们的家庭保持适当的生活水平。为了阻挠和转移工人争取提高工资的斗争，垄断资本家们企图把提高工资和提高生产率硬连在一起。实际上，“提高生产率”运动是掩饰一系列损害工人精力和体力的加强劳动强度的方法的幌子。垄断资本家的方法使得工作事故增加，造成解雇和失业的增加。这些方法的主要目的就是要使资本主义国家和殖民地国家大企业的利润增加到最大限度。
    在工资方面，世界工会联合会理事会坚决反对资本主义国家的企图把增加工资和提高生产率硬连在一起的一切措施。理事会认为，如果工人用他们的斗争迫使垄断资本从他们的巨额利润中拿出钱来增加工资并且迫使政府削减军事开支的话，增加工资而不引起物价上涨是可能的。它强调指出，劳动人民需要增加工资也是因为这样会促进国内市场的扩大，因为这对广大群众的福利是必要的。
    在研究苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的经济和社会情况的时候，世界工会联合会理事会注意到了和平生产的不断发展。在这基础上，人民的物质和文化生活水平不断地在提高。
    社会主义阵营各国实行了有系统地减低消费品价格的政策，并且正在大规模地进行住宅、学校、医院、剧院、运动场和其他公共福利设施的建设。
    世界工会联合会理事会确认，资本主义国家和殖民地国家的劳动人民用争取和平、争取提高生活水平、争取扩大民主权利和社会福利的斗争的新的高涨，回答了反动派的进攻。英国、法国、西德、意大利、日本、印度、巴西、智利、阿根廷、洪都拉斯和其他国家都发生了大规模的群众性的罢工。
    这些罢工证明，工人不愿听任他们的生活条件恶化，不愿听任他们的工会权利和民主权利受到侵犯。
    劳动人民在团结一致的口号下进行的英勇斗争和工人的国际性的团结，已经使得某些国家的政府和垄断资本不能执行它们的反劳工措施，并且使得许多工人运动领袖有可能从监狱中获得释放。
    从这一点出发，理事会要求各工会组织不倦地揭露提高生产率和工业集中的计划所隐藏着的目的，并且在更广泛的规模上扩大劳动人民的统一行动：
    在适当照顾每个国家，每一种产业、每一种行业和每一个厂矿企业的特殊情况下，争取普遍增加他们工资的购买力；
    争取通过协议或者立法来确立有保证的最低工资，保证在每个国家中实现尚能令人满意的生活条件；
    争取增加女工的工资；理事会认为有必要召集一次国际女工会议来研究在各国争取实现“同工同酬”原则的群众运动所应采取的方式；准备这次会议的筹备工作应该在各国全国性工会的广泛支持下进行；
    争取通过实现“同工同酬”的原则来增加童工的工资；
    反对加强劳动强度、赶快制度和其他超额剥削方法；为了促进这个运动，世界工会联合会计划在一九五五年对资本主义国家和殖民地国家的超额剥削进行一次广泛的国际调查；
    争取缩短工作周而不减少工资；
    争取调整农业工人，特别是殖民地和半殖民地的农业工人的工作日的限度；
    争取实行和改进社会保险制度；
    争取实行和改进工资照付的假期制度。
    理事会着重指出，劳动群众争取和平和维护他们的社会和经济的要求的斗争中取得胜利的关键，在于加强各种倾向的工会组织之间的统一行动和抱着不同政治见解和属于不同工会的工人之间的统一行动，特别是加强工厂中的来自下层的团结。
    自从世界工会第三次代表大会结束以来，工人群众争取团结的努力进一步增加了。例如西德的工会差不多一致地通过了一个决议，反对建立新国防军，反对把西德并入军事联盟，反对任何使西德重新军国主义化的行动，要求通过协商解决德国问题。
    在英国，各工会组织在职工大会上的投票表示出，极大部分的英国工人是反对复活德国军国主义的。
    另一方面，属于世界工会联合会的各工会的工人们同属于国际自由工会联合会的工会的会员们，已经采取了许多联合行动来维护他们的要求。
    这些例子生动地证明：劳动人民无论在争取和平的斗争中或者是在为实现他们的要求而进行的斗争中都是可能实现统一行动的。
    世界工会联合会理事会号召各工会组织作更大的努力来实现国际工会的团结一致。世界工会第三次代表大会的决议中强调说，重建这种团结一致将对工人有着重大的意义。世界工会联合会理事会宣布：只有大家都发挥了目的在于加强国际工人团结的实际的积极性，国际工会的团结一致才能够扩大。
    到一九五五年，世界工会联合会就要满十周年了。为了纪念这一年，各国工人应该更大规模地互派代表团，各工会组织间和各厂矿企业的工人间应该建立直接的接触，这样将会有效地加强国际工人的团结一致。
    因此，世界工会联合会理事会号召一切工会组织（不管它是否属于世界工会联合会）发挥出各方面的积极性，来加强和扩大国内和国际的工人阶级的团结一致。只有这样作，工人在争取一切国家和平共处、争取国际间的经济和文化合作、争取提高劳动群众的生活水平和争取幸福、自由及和平的斗争中，才能取得决定性的胜利。
