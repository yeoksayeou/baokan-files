    雅加达几十万人集会要求收回西伊里安
    【新华社雅加达六日电】据印度尼西亚新闻社报道：雅加达五日举行有数十万人参加的群众大会，要求收回西伊里安。大会通过决议，谴责荷兰对西伊里安的统治为侵略，并要求废除同荷兰订的一切经济和财政协定。这次群众大会是在解放西伊里安委员会和印度尼西亚妇女联合会中央委员会的创议下举行的。
    大会决议还要求对那些为荷兰在西伊里安的殖民政策作辩护的分子采取措施。决议并呼吁世界各国政府和人民支持印度尼西亚提出的把西伊里安从荷兰殖民主义者手中解放出来的要求。
    群众大会结束后，以解放西伊里安委员会主席哈迪克苏莫夫人为首的代表团把这个提交印度尼西亚政府的决议送给外交部长苏纳约。决议副本并分送印度尼西亚总统、总理，荷兰驻印度尼西亚高级专员，以及联合国会员国和各个国际组织。
