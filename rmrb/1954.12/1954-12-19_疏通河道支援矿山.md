Dredging of the Gong River and Tao River in Jiangxi Province (both tributaries of the Gan River) is underway on a relatively large scale. In the near future, they will become important transportation lines supporting mine construction and developing the local economy and culture.

The Gong River is 440 li long, and the areas along the river are famous grain-producing areas in Jiangxi, with abundant local specialties. The Tao River is 460 li long and serves as a transportation channel for basic construction materials, ore, and grain for mines in southern Jiangxi. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the banks of these two rivers collapsed, and the riverbeds were silted up with sand and mud, allowing only civilian boats of about 6 tons to navigate. In the dry season, only bamboo rafts could travel.

In mid-September this year, the Southern Jiangxi Administrative Office and the Southern Jiangxi Shipping Administration selected outstanding technical cadres to investigate and survey the waterways, river beaches, and water levels of the Gong River and Tao River. Currently, workers dredging the Gong River are braving the cold to blast reefs and dangerous shoals. According to the plan, the project of blasting reefs and repairing towpaths will be completed by the end of this year. In January next year, the 340-li waterway from Ganzhou to Huichang will be open to steamers. The survey work on the Tao River has been completed, and the dredging and opening to navigation are planned for completion next year.

    疏通河道支援矿山
    江西省贡河和桃江（都是赣江支流）正进行规模较大的疏浚工程。不久的将来，它们将成为支援矿山建设、发展当地经济文化的重要运输线。
    贡河全长四百四十里，沿岸地区是江西著名的粮食产地，土特产十分丰富。桃江全长四百六十里，是赣南矿山基本建设器材、矿砂和粮食的运输航道。在国民党反动统治期间，这两条河的河边崖岸塌陷，河床沙泥淤塞，只可航行六吨左右的民船，枯水季节仅可行驶竹筏。
    今年九月中旬，赣南行署和赣南航运管理处，选择了优秀的技术干部，对贡河和桃江的航道、河滩、水位等情况进行了调查勘测。现在，疏浚贡河
  河道的职工们，正冒着寒冷爆炸礁石、滩险。按照
  计划，爆炸礁石、整理纤道的工程在今年年底将全部完工。明年一月份，由赣州到会昌的三百四十里航道就可通行汽轮。桃江的勘测工作已结束，计划明年完成疏浚通航任务。
