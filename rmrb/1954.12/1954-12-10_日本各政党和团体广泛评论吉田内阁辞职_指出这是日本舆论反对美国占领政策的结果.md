Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: Tokyo Dispatch: Following the collapse of the Yoshida Cabinet, Japanese political parties and labor union organizations have widely issued comments.

    A spokesman for the Japanese Communist Party pointed out: The resignation of the Yoshida Cabinet is the result of public opinion feeling angry about Japan's subordinate status to the United States.

    Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the left-wing Socialist Party, said: The Yoshida Cabinet fell due to being defeated by public opinion.

    Kawakami Jotaro, Chairman of the right-wing Socialist Party, said: "The Yoshida Cabinet monopolized power for six years, using reactionary and retrogressive methods and a pro-American foreign policy to hinder Japan's independence and peace, and to damage the people's livelihood. Its downfall is truly gratifying."

    Kishi Nobusuke, Secretary-General of the Japan Democratic Party, said: The Yoshida Cabinet resigned because it could not resist national public opinion.

    Takano Minoru, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), Japan's largest trade union federation, condemned the Yoshida Cabinet's "pro-American" policy. He said: The movement of workers, farmers, and intellectuals to "overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet" has finally yielded results. The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan and the Japan Council of Government and Public Workers' Unions immediately issued statements after the resignation of the Yoshida Cabinet, firmly demanding the dissolution of the Diet and the holding of general elections as soon as possible.

    Japan's three major newspapers, "Asahi Shimbun," "Yomiuri Shimbun," and "Mainichi Shimbun," published editorials, unanimously demanding that the next cabinet dissolve the Diet and hold new general elections to obtain a new mandate from the voters.

Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: Jakarta Dispatch: "Indonesia News" commented on the collapse of the Japanese Yoshida Cabinet on the 8th, believing that the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida is a manifestation of the failure of the United States' Asian policy.

    The newspaper said: "Yoshida has done everything in his power to maintain his pro-American policy." It also pointed out: "The United States invests millions of dollars in Japan every year. The United States hopes to make Japan its last fortress in the Pacific. Yoshida's downfall is also a failure of the United States' policy in this part of the world."

    左派社会党主席铃木茂三郎说：吉田内阁是败于舆论而倒台的。
    右派社会党主席河上丈太郎说：“吉田内阁垄断政权六年，用反动的倒行逆施的办法和向美国一边倒的外交政策阻碍了日本的独立与和平，破坏了国民生活，它的倒台实在令人高兴。”
    日本民主党干事长岸信介说：吉田内阁是由于不能抗拒国民的舆论而辞职的。
    日本最大的工会联合会日本工会总评议会事务局长高野实谴责吉田内阁“向美国一边倒”的政策。他说：工人、农民和知识分子“打倒吉田内阁”的运动终于得到了结果。日本工会总评议会和日本官公厅工会协议会在吉田内阁辞职后立即发表声明，坚决要求及早解散国会举行大选。
    日本三大报纸“朝日新闻”、“读卖新闻”和 “每日新闻”发表社论，一致要求下届内阁解散国会，重新举行大选，以取得选民的新的委任。
      【新华社九日讯】雅加达消息：“印度尼西亚新闻”在八日评论日本吉田内阁的垮台时认为：日本首相吉田的辞职是美国的亚洲政策失败的表现。
