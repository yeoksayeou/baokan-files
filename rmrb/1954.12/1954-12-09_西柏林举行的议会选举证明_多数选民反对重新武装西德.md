Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 7th. TASS, Berlin, December 6th: Berlin newspapers reported on December 6th the preliminary results of the West Berlin city council elections held on December 5th.

According to the German News Agency, 91.6 percent of West Berlin voters participated in the election. Nine parties competed. Among them, the German Social Democratic Party received 44 percent of the vote, Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union received 30 percent, the Free Democratic Party received 12 percent, the German Socialist Unity Party received 2.7 percent, and the German Independent Social Democratic Party received 0.1 percent.

The election results prove that the vast majority of working people in West Berlin oppose the Adenauer government's policy of arming West Germany within the Western military bloc. The vast majority of West Berlin voters clearly realize that this policy will make the reunification of Germany and Berlin on a peaceful and democratic basis impossible.

The West Berlin election on December 5th was conducted under conditions of police terror. According to Berlin democratic newspapers, on the day of the election, West Berlin police arrested 1,900 supporters of the German Socialist Unity Party. This police terror prevented all of those West Berlin voters who supported the German Socialist Unity Party from voting for the party's candidates. In addition, due to the implementation of anti-democratic election laws, the German Socialist Unity Party was unable to obtain seats in the West Berlin city council.

    西柏林举行的议会选举证明
    多数选民反对重新武装西德
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林六日讯：十二月六日柏林各报报道了西柏林十二月五日举行的西柏林市议会选举的初步结果。
    据德意志通讯社报道，西柏林选民有百分之九十一点六参加了选举。参加竞选的有九个政党。其中德国社会民主党得票占总数的百分之四十四，阿登纳的基督教民主联盟得票占百分之三十，自由民主党得票占百分之十二，德国统一社会党得票占百分之二点七，德国独立社会民主党得票占百分之零点一。
    选举结果证明，西柏林的绝大多数劳动人民都反对阿登纳政府所执行的在西方国家军事集团内武装西德的政策。绝大多数西柏林选民清楚地意识到，这种政策将使在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国和柏林的统一成为不可能。
    十二月五日的西柏林选举是在警察恐怖的条件下进行的。据柏林民主报纸报道，在选举那一天，西柏林的警察逮捕了一千九百名拥护德国统一社会党的人。这种警察恐怖使西柏林拥护德国统一社会党的那些选民不能全体投票选举这个党的候选人。此外，由于实施反民主的选举法，使得德国统一社会党没能在西柏林市议会中得到席位。
