Beijing's Various Circles Support the Resolution of the World Peace Council's Stockholm Meeting

The conference of various circles in Beijing listened to the report by the Chinese delegation on the situation and achievements of the Stockholm meeting of the World Peace Council with great satisfaction. All participants unanimously expressed warm support for the resolutions adopted by the Stockholm meeting of the World Peace Council.

The "Appeal to the People of All Countries" of the Stockholm meeting of the World Peace Council pointed out that the ratification of the London and Paris agreements would revive West German militarism and incorporate West Germany into an aggressive military bloc, creating a new crisis for peace in Europe and the world. Therefore, it called on the people of all countries to resolutely oppose the ratification of the London and Paris agreements and demand an immediate Four-Power conference to resolve the German issue and ensure European security. The European countries meeting held in Moscow recently unanimously adopted a joint declaration of great historical significance, pointing out the correct path for resolving the German issue and establishing a European collective security system. We firmly support the "Appeal to the People of All Countries" of the Stockholm meeting of the World Peace Council and the joint declaration of the European countries meeting, and we are willing to work with the people of Europe and other countries in the world to safeguard European security, European peace, and world peace through joint actions.

We unanimously support the World Peace Council's Stockholm meeting's "Resolution on the Situation in Various Parts of Asia Caused by Foreign Pressure and by Group and Military Alliance Systems." The American aggressive bloc and its followers not only signed the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" in September this year, which aims to divide Asia and make Asians fight Asians, creating a new threat to peace in Southeast Asia and Asia; but also recently the U.S. government illegally signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to permanently occupy our territory Taiwan and prepare to launch a new war of aggression, making the Asian situation serious. Regarding the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, representing our government and the people of the whole country, issued a solemn statement on December 8th. All participants firmly support this solemn statement by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai: We, the Chinese people, must liberate Taiwan, and the American aggressors must withdraw all armed forces from our territory Taiwan, Penghu, and the Taiwan Strait, and end the occupation of Taiwan. We will further strengthen the struggle to liberate Taiwan in all aspects, and at the same time, we are willing to work with the people of Asian countries to defeat the new conspiracy of aggression by the American warmongers, consolidate and expand the Asian peace zone based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence solemnly announced to the world in the recent meeting between the Prime Ministers of China, India, and Burma, and continue to strive for the establishment of collective peace and security in Asia.

We firmly support the resolutions of the World Peace Council's Stockholm meeting on demanding universal disarmament and banning weapons of mass destruction, demanding an end to foreign interference in the internal affairs of various countries, and warmly welcome the call of the World Peace Council's Stockholm meeting to convene a World Peace Forces Congress in May 1955.

We are willing to work with the people of all countries in the world to promote the thorough implementation of the resolutions of the World Peace Council's Stockholm meeting, to consolidate and ensure lasting world peace, and to achieve peaceful coexistence among all countries. We firmly believe that victory belongs to peace and peace-loving people.

    北京各界拥护世界和平理事会
    斯德哥尔摩会议决议的决议
    北京各界拥护世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议大会以极满意的心情听取了中国代表团关于会议情况及其成就的传达报告，全体与会人员对世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议所通过的各项决议，一致表示热烈的拥护。
    世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议“告各国人民书”指出伦敦和巴黎协定的批准，将复活西德的军国主义并使西德加入侵略性军事集团，造成对欧洲和全世界和平的新危机，因此号召各国人民必须坚决反对批准伦敦和巴黎协定，要求立即举行四大国会议来解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全问题。最近在莫斯科召开的欧洲国家会议，更一致通过了具有重大历史意义的联合宣言，指出了解决德国问题和建立欧洲集体安全体系的正确道路。我们坚决拥护世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议“告各国人民书”的号召和欧洲国家会议的联合宣言，并愿与欧洲及世界各国人民以共同行动来为保障欧洲安全，为保障欧洲和平和保障世界和平而努力。
    我们一致支持世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议
  “关于由于外国压力和由于集团和军事联盟体系而在亚洲各地造成的局势的决议”。美国侵略集团及其追随者不仅于今年九月签订了旨在分裂亚洲，使亚洲人打亚洲人的所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”，造成了对东南亚及亚洲和平的新威胁；并且最近美国政府更与蒋介石卖国集团非法签订了所谓“共同防御条约”，企图永远侵占我国领土台湾，准备发动新的侵略战争，使亚洲局势严重起来。关于美蒋
  “共同防御条约”，我国外交部长周恩来代表我国政府和全国人民于十二月八日已发表了严正声明，我们全体与会人员坚决拥护我国外交部长周恩来这一严正声明：我们中国人民一定要解放台湾，美国侵略者必须把一切武装力量从我国领土台湾、澎湖和台湾海峡撤走，结束对于台湾的侵占。我们将从各方面进一步加强解放台湾的斗争，同时我们愿与亚洲各国人民一道，为挫败美国好战分子侵略的新阴谋，根据最近中印、中缅总理会谈中向全世界庄严宣告的和平共处的五项原则努力巩固和扩大亚洲的和平地区，为建立亚洲的集体和平和安全而继续奋斗。
    我们坚决支持世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议对于要求普遍裁减军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器，要求结束外国干涉各国内政等各项决议，并热烈欢迎世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议决定在一九五五年五月召开世界和平力量大会的号召。
    我们愿与世界各国人民一道，共同为促使世界和平理事会斯德哥尔摩会议各项决议的彻底实现，为巩固和确保世界持久和平，实现各国和平共处而努力。我们深信，胜利是属于和平和爱好和平的人民的。    一九五四年十二月十七日
