    Concealing Production is Wrong
    Gao Xingen, Township Head of Wu Ba Township, Sixth District, Shouzhang County, Shandong Province
    This year, Wu Ba Township had a bumper harvest. However, when the district convened a meeting of township cadres to convey the policy of grain unified purchase and distribution and to arrange the work of production assessment, I remembered that last autumn, in the work of production assessment, because I reported the actual output, I was "opposed" by some people. So I planned to assess this year's output lower, so as not to cause the masses to "oppose" me again, and it would be easier to complete the task.
    Back from the district, when discussing the division of areas and setting production targets with several main cadres of the township, I said to them: "This year, the crops we harvested look really good, but the actual grain yield is much lower! We must not set the output too high." At the beginning of the area division and production assessment, I said again: "This time, when setting the production targets, set the outer circle of land a little higher. First, let the other townships see that we are reporting the actual output, and second, the superiors will say that we are serious and active. Then, we will make up for it by setting lower yields in the inner areas." As a result, the average yield per mu for the whole township was estimated at only 128 jin. However, the Wu Jiuxiang agricultural producers' cooperative in this township harvested an average of more than 190 jin per mu, and Li Chunzhen, a individual farmer, harvested more than 180 jin of soybeans per mu.
    The district did not approve our false figure. We then fabricated a false output of 133 jin and reported it to the district for the second time, but the district still did not approve it.
    On the way back from the district, I thought: Could it be that the superiors already know? But if I report the actual output, wouldn't the masses blame me? I thought, does it mean that if my township doesn't report the actual output, the country cannot be built and cannot support the liberation of Taiwan? I also thought that when unified purchase and distribution was implemented last winter, I actively sold grain at first, but then it was difficult to buy a little! Besides, the old face of the neighbors in my township and village is still important, and I can't let the masses "oppose" me. When I got home, I fabricated another false figure of "138 jin per mu" and went to the district for the third time, asking the district head to approve it. The district head looked at me and said: "Comrade Xingen, production assessment should be based on facts. You are a Communist Party member. The country is carrying out socialist construction. You also understand this. Do I need to say more!" It seemed that he was a little dissatisfied, but I ignored him and went back to the township, where I made a register according to the false output.
    Recently, I attended the Party Representative Congress in the county and listened to the mobilization reports of some leading comrades calling for doing a good job in unified purchase and distribution. I felt that some of the words really touched my heart. Lying in bed at night, I repeatedly thought to myself: I used to be a poor child, but now? I am a Communist Party member, a township cadre, my family life is better, and both of my sons have graduated from junior high school. How could I have reached this point? I also thought of the benefits of implementing unified purchase and distribution last year, as pointed out by the leading comrades at the meeting, which are right in front of my eyes. No one went to borrow high-interest loans from rich peasants this spring; last winter and this spring, the government distributed 16,000 jin of relief grain and more than 20 million yuan in various relief funds to the whole township, supplying more than 80,000 jin of grain to households with grain shortages... Furthermore, if all townships concealed their output like me, the liberation of Taiwan would be difficult, and socialist construction would have to be delayed. I began to realize that it was wrong to falsely report output. I asked myself again: Why did I do that? Is that what a Party member should do? Fearing that reporting the actual output would be "opposed" by the masses is actually a manifestation of irresponsibility in work, as well as underestimating the consciousness of the masses and being irresponsible to the masses. This is because my selfish individualism is at play.
    Now I have completely figured it out. I feel sorry for the Party and the country. I should resolutely correct my mistakes. I will definitely guarantee to act in accordance with the Party's policies and the government's regulations, report the actual output in a realistic manner, mobilize all the farmers in the township to sell all the surplus grain to the state, and support national construction, support the liberation of Taiwan, and support the disaster areas.

    隐瞒产量是错误的
    山东省寿张县六区吴坝乡乡长　高新更
    今年吴坝乡的庄稼丰收。可是区里召开乡干部会议传达粮食统购政策并布置评产工作时，我想起去年秋天在评产工作中，因为报实了产量，曾遭到一部分人的“反对”，就打算把今年产量评得低些，不再叫群众“反对”，任务也好完成。
    由区里回来，在和同乡的几个主要干部研究划片定产时，我就对他们说：“今年咱们收的庄稼看着长得真好，要看打的粮食那可差远啦！咱们可不能把产量定得太高了。”在开始划片评产时，我又说：“这次定产，外圈地定高一点，一来叫外乡看咱们报实了产量，二来上级也会说咱们认真积极。然后，再从内地定低产量来补齐。”结果，全乡每亩平均产量仅估了一百二十八斤。而本乡吴九祥农业生产合作社每亩平均收了一百九十多斤，单干农民李春祯的豆子每亩也打了一百八十多斤。
    区里没批准我们这个假数字。我们又造了个一百三十三斤的假产量，二次报区，区里仍没批准。
    我从区里回来，在路上想：莫非是上级都知道了吗？但是，如果我报实了产量，群众岂不是会怪我？我想难道说我这个乡不报实，国家就不能建设，就无法支援解放台湾吗？又想到去冬统购统销时，我先是积极卖了粮食，后来要买一点可就难啦！再说，还是当着本乡本村，街坊邻舍的老面子要紧，可不能让群众“反对”。回到家我又造了个“每亩产量一百三十八斤”的假数字，第三次到了区里，请区长批准。区长看了看我，便对我说：“新更同志，评产要做到实事求是，你是个共产党员，国家正在进行社会主义建设，你也懂得，还用多说些话吗！”看样子，他是有点不大满意，我也没管他，回到乡里，就按照假产量造了册子。
    最近，我到县里参加了党员代表大会，听了一些领导同志号召做好统购工作的动员报告。我觉得有些话，真说到自己心里来了。晚上睡在床上，自己就反复地想：我过去是个穷孩子，现在呢？是个共产党员，是个乡干部，家庭生活好了，两个儿子都已高小毕业了，是怎样才能到这个地步的呢？我又想到领导同志在会上指明的去年实行统购统销的好处，不正摆在眼前吗？今春没有人再去借富农的高利贷粮食；去冬今春，政府发给了全乡救济粮一万六千斤，各项救济款两千多万元，供应了全乡缺粮户八万多斤粮食……。再说，如果各乡都像我这样隐瞒产量，解放台湾就会有困难，社会主义建设也得往后拖啦。我开始醒悟，假报产量的做法是错了。我又反问自己：为什么要那样做呢？那是党员应该做的事吗？怕评实产量会遭到群众“反对”，其实是对工作不负责任的表现，也是低估了群众的觉悟、对群众不负责的表现。这是因为我自私自利的个人主义思想在作怪。
    现在我完全想开了，我觉得对不住党，对不住国家，我应当坚决改正自己的错误。我一定保证按照党的政策，按照政府的规定办事，实事求是地报实产量，动员全乡农民，把余粮全部卖给国家，支援国家建设、支援解放台湾、支援灾区。
