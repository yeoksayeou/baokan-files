    Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 5th: Soviet representative Malik spoke on December 1st at the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee regarding the Korean question.

    Malik pointed out that the Political Committee's refusal to invite representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion on the Korean question deprives the General Assembly of the possibility of objectively discussing the Korean issue and making legally valid and practically valuable decisions.

    Malik then listed the efforts made by the governments of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Geneva Conference to achieve a successful resolution of the Korean question.

    He pointed out that the proposal to seek the unification of Korea on the basis of free elections throughout Korea was opposed by certain delegations, primarily the United States delegation. The United States and the countries following it rejected all the proposals made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union to strive for the unification of Korea and to continue consultations. They (especially the United States) must bear full responsibility for obstructing a peaceful resolution of the Korean question at the Geneva Conference.

    Malik continued: Since the end of the Geneva Conference, the policy of opposing a resolution of the Korean question has continued to be implemented. The provocative actions and attempts of the South Korean authorities have been encouraged. The South Korean authorities have openly declared that they will continue to resolutely oppose any negotiations on resolving the Korean question; they want to launch another war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in order to unify Korea by war.

    Malik pointed out that the countries participating in the intervention in Korea are attempting to avoid reaching an agreement and are also particularly trying to exacerbate the differences between the representatives participating in the meeting.

    The report currently received by the General Assembly shows that the drafters are eager to declare at any cost that the hope for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question is "empty," insisting that such a resolution is impossible, and that Korea should remain divided and occupied by foreign troops until the demands of the report's drafters are accepted.

    Malik said that the main points and substance of these demands are: first, that only the United Nations should handle the resolution of the Korean question; second, that the Korean people should give up their legitimate right to prepare and hold national elections without external interference.

    However, it should be clear that elections throughout Korea must be held by the Koreans themselves and must be controlled by the Korean people. The only way to guarantee this is to establish an all-Korean body to carry out the election work.

    As for the United Nations' participation, it is not difficult to see that this issue is artificially attached in order to get any excuse to refuse to hold any further negotiations on the Korean question in Geneva.

    The Soviet delegation believes that the United Nations should be concerned with the early peaceful resolution of the Korean question, guaranteeing the legitimate rights of the Korean people, and strengthening peace in the Far East. If this goal can be achieved through direct negotiations between the countries concerned, the United Nations should welcome and encourage the resumption of such negotiations, rather than preventing their resumption.

    Malik pointed out that the biased report of the countries participating in the intervention in Korea, with ulterior motives, will not achieve the goal of a peaceful resolution of the Korean question.

    Malik continued, the existence of the so-called United Nations Commission for Korea does not promote the resolution of the above issues, but rather hinders the peaceful resolution of the Korean question and is used to cover up foreign interference in Korea. The Soviet delegation believes that in order to resolve the Korean question at an early date, the aforementioned United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea should be abolished.

    Malik pointed out that the General Assembly's resolution of May 18, 1951, on imposing a trade embargo on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, seriously hinders the strengthening of world peace and obstructs the development of normal trade and economic relations. In order to ease international tensions and promote economic relations between countries, it is necessary for the General Assembly to take steps to abolish the above resolution.

    Malik concluded by saying that the resolution of the Korean question cannot be delayed any longer. The task of all the countries concerned is to work together to find a way to resolve the Korean question. To achieve this goal, efforts must be made to reconcile views, rather than emphasizing differences in advance. It is possible and necessary to find realistic ways for the countries concerned to reach agreement and comprehensive understanding in assisting the Korean people to unify and revive their country. He then submitted a proposal to the committee stipulating that a meeting of the countries concerned to discuss the Korean question be held in the near future in order to reach an agreement on a peaceful resolution of the Korean question on the basis of establishing a unified, independent, and democratic Korea.

    十二月一日在联大政委会会议上
    苏联代表马立克关于朝鲜问题的发言（摘要）
   【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社纽约四日讯：苏联代表马立克十二月一日在联合国大会政治委员会就朝鲜问题发言。
    马立克指出，政治委员会拒绝邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的代表参加关于朝鲜问题的讨论，这就剥夺了大会客观地讨论朝鲜问题并作出具有法律效力和实际价值的决定的可能性。
    马立克接着列举苏联和中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的政府在日内瓦会议上为使朝鲜问题获得顺利解决而作的努力。
    他指出，在全朝鲜自由选举的基础上求得朝鲜统一的主张，遭到了某些代表团、首先是美国代表团的反对。美国以及追随它的国家拒绝了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国和苏联提出的一切争取统一朝鲜和争取继续协商的建议，它们（特别是美国）对于在日内瓦会议上阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题要担负全部责任。
    马立克接着说：自从日内瓦会议结束以来，反对朝鲜问题获得解决的政策一直继续在执行着。南朝鲜当局的挑衅行动和企图得到了鼓励。南朝鲜当局曾公开宣布：他们将继续坚决反对举行任何关于解决朝鲜问题的谈判；他们要对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国再度发动战争，以便用战争手段来统一朝鲜。
    马立克指出，参加干涉朝鲜的国家企图避免达成协议，而且还特别设法使参加会议的代表之间的分歧加甚。
    大会目前收到的报告表明，起草报告的人急于要不惜任何代价声明，朝鲜问题和平解决的希望是“空的”，硬说这样一个解决是不可能的，朝鲜应该保持分裂，被外国军队占领，直到报告起草人的要求被接受为止。
    马立克说，这些要求的要领和实质是：第一，只有让联合国来处理朝鲜问题的解决；第二，朝鲜人民应该放弃他们在不受外来干涉的情况下准备和举行全国选举的合法权利。
    但是，应该很清楚，全朝鲜选举必须由朝鲜人自己举行，必须由朝鲜人民控制。保证这一点的唯一办法，是成立一个全朝鲜机构来进行选举的工作。
    至于联合国方面参与，不难看出这个问题是人为地附加上去的，以便得到任何借口来拒绝在日内瓦就朝鲜问题再举行任何谈判。
    苏联代表团认为，联合国关心的应该是早日和平解决朝鲜问题，保证朝鲜人民的合法权利，加强远东的和平。如果能够通过有关国家的直接谈判达到这个目的，联合国应该欢迎和鼓励恢复这种谈判，而不是阻止这种谈判的恢复。
    马立克指出，参加干涉朝鲜的国家的别有用心的和片面的报告，并不能达到和平解决朝鲜问题的目的。
    马立克接着说，所谓联合国朝鲜委员会的存在并不能促进上述问题的解决，反而妨碍了朝鲜问题的和平解决，并且被利用来掩饰外国对朝鲜的干涉。苏联代表团认为，为了早日解决朝鲜问题起见，上述联合国朝鲜统一复兴委员会应该撤销。
    马立克指出，大会在一九五一年五月十八日关于对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国实施贸易禁运的决议，严重妨碍世界和平的加强，阻挠了正常贸易和经济关系的发展。为了缓和国际紧张局势和促进各国间的经济关系，大会有必要采取步骤取消上述的决议。
    马立克最后说：朝鲜问题的解决是不能再拖延了。一切有关国家的任务就是共同努力寻找解决朝鲜问题的办法。为了达到这个目的，必须努力调和观点，而不是预先就强调分歧。有可能而且有必要寻找现实的办法，使有关国家在协助朝鲜人民统一和复兴他们的国家方面，达成协议和全面的谅解。他接着向委员会提出了一个提案，规定在最近的将来举行有关国家讨论朝鲜问题的会议以便达成协议在建立一个统一、独立和民主的朝鲜的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题。
