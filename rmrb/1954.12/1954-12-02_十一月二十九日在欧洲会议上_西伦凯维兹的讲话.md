Comrades,

    The delegation of the Polish People's Republic is attending the European Conference to discuss measures to guarantee peace and security in Europe together with other countries that have a vital stake in the new situation. This new situation has been caused by the Western governments' attempt to rebuild the aggressive new Hitlerian "Defense Force" by all means possible.

    The revival of the new Hitlerian "Defense Force" and the remilitarization of West Germany on the basis of the approval of the Paris Agreements threatens Poland's security, the Polish people, and the cause of peace.

    The Polish people and the Polish government cannot ignore such a danger; on the contrary, they must take all measures and concentrate all their forces to avoid this danger.

    The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a conference to discuss this issue was, from the very beginning, in line with the Polish government's desire to discuss the issue of European security with other countries.

    The Polish government attaches great importance to this conference and is prepared to do its part in implementing the agreed-upon principles, so as to combine our strengths to safeguard the common security of peace-loving countries in the new situation, and thus also to safeguard the security of Poland and its borders, and the security of the Polish people.

    The firm stance of the Polish people has received the full support of other countries, which, based on their historical experience and a realistic common assessment of the aggressive plans of the American imperialists who are reviving the new Hitlerian army of Germany – which undoubtedly threatens Poland and other European countries, and not only the people of other European countries – are expressing their unwavering will to prevent this danger together with us.

    The Polish people fully understand the danger of remilitarizing an aggressive Germany, and they have stated their attitude on this issue very firmly in thousands of gatherings large and small. The will of the Polish people is reflected in the actions of the Polish government delegation participating in this conference, and in the full support of the Soviet stance expressed in the speech of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov by this delegation.

    German militarism is not the first time it has threatened the peoples of Europe with incalculable disasters. Since militarism and militarists finally prevailed in Germany, Europe has in fact been in a constant state of unrest. The German aggression against France in 1870-1871 was only the prelude to the various activities that German militarists later engaged in in Europe – political pressure, aggressive measures, and armed attacks. Three large-scale wars of aggression in three-quarters of a century – two of which turned into world wars that caused tens of millions of lives and incalculable destruction – are enough to prove the danger of German militarism to Europe, to the world, to civilization, and to world culture.

    However, German militarism has never concealed its aims, and it has always been blatant and shameless in expressing its wishes. One can cite many brazen statements challenging the world made by responsible German politicians or soldiers. For example, Moltke, one of the leaders of German militarism and one of the organizers of the German imperialist army, once made such remarks: "Lasting peace is a dream, and not even a beautiful dream. War is part of the sacred mission on earth."

    This is not just intimidation, but an attempt to philosophically justify heinous crimes against humanity such as wars of aggression. This is an attempt to elevate this crime to the status of a sacred mission. From Moltke's time to the present, this philosophy has been the motto of German militarists.

    The ordinary people of all of Europe understood this truth about German militarism long ago. They didn't need to study the works of Moltke or Hitler for this. Those who advocated Moltke's views had attempted to provide practical instruction to the people of Europe three times in seventy years.

    The ordinary people of the countries bordering Germany have not forgotten this, and cannot possibly forget this. The memory of the terrible years of World War II still sends chills down the spine of every honest person (French, Russian, Czech, Slovak, Yugoslav and British – everyone who has experienced the horror of war). Auschwitz, Lidice and Oradour, the razed Jewish ghettos and destroyed Warsaw, Stalingrad, Coventry and dozens of other cities are evidence of this horror, and no amount of cunning sophistry by Western diplomats can diminish the scale of this horror. These Western diplomats are currently trying to formulate plans to arm Moltke's worshipers, who have been enriched by Hitler's experience.

    For the Polish people, whose homeland became the first battlefield of World War II, no argument can convince us that rearming German militarists will not cause the danger of plunging our country and all other countries in Europe into another disaster. On the eve of the attack on our country, Adolf Hitler issued an order, which had never been seen before in human history:

  "The destruction of Poland is the current goal...I will give you a propaganda pretext for starting the war. Don't care whether this pretext sounds reasonable. Be cruel and ruthless. Might is right. Act extremely cruelly. The complete destruction of Poland is our war aim."

    While the "guarantees" of Western countries remained on paper, Hitler's war criminals carried out Hitler's orders and caused the Polish people to bleed.

    This order was carried out thoroughly.

    In six years, it cost us six million lives, and the country, cities, and villages suffered terrible destruction. Who can tolerate the possibility of this situation happening again? As for the Polish people, they are against such a possibility.

    It is also worth mentioning the example of Czechoslovakia, the result of the conclusion of the shameless Munich Agreement made Czechoslovakia fall into the hands of Hitler's beasts before the war even officially began, Czechoslovakia experienced all the horrors of being gradually torn into pieces alive, until finally, Hitler broke the most solemn guarantees he had made to Western politicians in Munich and seized the remaining parts.

    Even the British Prime Minister who signed this agreement had to say after March 15, 1939, that he had been deceived in order to defend himself in front of public opinion. Can we forget this historical lesson, which explains the value of the guarantees made by German militarism so clearly?

    Is it incomprehensible that the word remilitarization will arouse immense anger and cause people to clench their fists in the Soviet Union, which bore the brunt of the war against the Nazi aggressors? Because it was they – the Soviet soldiers – who had to trek across Europe, from the Caucasus to Berlin, to give German militarism a decisive blow.

    Or let us look at the history of France. France has been invaded three times in seventy years. Paris has twice been trampled by the iron hooves of victors and trampled by the jackboots of the German "Defense Force." Each invasion cost France a large number of lives, and the entire young generation of France paid with their blood. During the period between the two world wars, French political leaders took a step that brought great disasters to the French people; the people immediately felt the consequences of this step – bloody and cruel consequences: during the years of occupation and the Vichy regime, the national self-esteem of the French people suffered immense humiliation.

    Despite this, there are now some political leaders in France who are prepared to support the revival of the evil German militarist army.

    Belgium has also experienced similar tests, it has twice fallen victim to German militarists, just before this German militarists had guaranteed to respect its neutrality. Italy, from its own experience also experienced the value of "alliance" with German militarism, the result of it participating in this "alliance" was bloodshed and being trampled by its own "allies."

    The experience of the European countries that have suffered greatly from German militarism is tragic. The Polish people and the people of other peace-loving countries have been able to draw the correct conclusion from this experience: the world is too small to accommodate both the free people of all countries and the existence of German militarism at the same time.

    These conclusions, which are understandable to the people of all countries, do not suit the tastes of some Western politicians who want to bring German militarism back onto the stage of history. This is the essence of the London and Paris agreements, and nothing can conceal this essence.

    Those forces that decided German militarist policy from the time of Moltke to the time of Hitler are now raising their heads again in West Germany. These forces are what Churchill had attempted to rely on not only during the two world wars, and, as he himself now admits, also what he considered in his perfidious plans to plot against his ally, the Soviet Union, when the anti-Hitler war was still at its height.

    Every thoughtful politician who is familiar with the history of the past hundred years must recognize – whether he admits it or not – that once German militarist forces are allowed to act freely, no one can control them, not even those who are responsible for this situation.

    Everyone knows that shortly after the outbreak of World War II, German militarism, which had been preparing to advance eastward for twenty years between the two wars with the support of the British, American, and French imperialist blocs, immediately spread the flames of war to the territories of Western countries. German militarists were willing to decide for themselves the direction of their attacks, as their protectors had the opportunity to see for themselves.

    Indeed, the words "guarantee" and "supervision" that have been repeatedly repeated at the London and Paris conferences are the best evidence that the consciences of Western European politicians are uneasy.

    If the partners of German militarism have to seek various preventive measures and "guarantees" to guard against him, then he is a terrible ally.

    Obviously, the main purpose of all the clamoring about "supervision" and "guarantees" is to ease, or rather, to deceive public opinion, which is very uneasy about the dangers brought about by the revival of German militarism. The mainstay of Western European militarists is the American imperialist aggressor group, and they have no control or restrictions over the plans of West German militarists. For the American aggressor group, which is bent on finding excuses to launch new international adventures, the new "Defense Force" is an invaluable ally, because this ally has absolutely no "scruples" and is willing to do anything. The American aggressor group needs to arm West Germany in order to carry out their military plans through the hands of German militarists. No matter how the leaders of American policy try to appear as the protectors of Western European countries (which they claim are in danger), they cannot conceal the above fact, and the fact that Western European countries are in danger is of course indisputable, but the only source of this danger is the American war plan, according to which the whole of Europe is to be turned into a new battlefield.

    For the American imperialist group, the new "Defense Force" is not only a tool to carry out their aggressive plans, but also the gendarme of Europe. This is precisely the force they are willing to entrust with the heavy responsibility of maintaining "order" in Western European countries, in which the people have already issued loud voices against aggression and war, against atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, against German militarism and demanding peaceful coexistence, demanding relaxation of international tensions, demanding the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, demanding disarmament and peace.

    When French public opinion struck at the European Army and won the armistice in Indochina, the imperialist group suffered a heavy defeat. Now the imperialist group is trying to undermine the sovereignty of European countries that hinder the implementation of their plans. The retention of the West German occupation system, the special clauses stipulated in the Paris Agreements that allow interference in the internal affairs of various countries, and the control of the economic lifeline of West Germany – all of this is aimed at making West Germany completely subordinate to the United States and using it as a tool to promote American imperialist policy. All of this is to strengthen American pressure on France and other Western European countries, thereby ensuring American's unique control over the entire Western Europe.

    American aggressor groups believe that the Bonn "Defense Force" will act in their interests and will be able to suppress the dissatisfaction of the people of Western European countries, which poses a great threat to the aggressors, so American politicians are doing everything to shield their Bonn partners. They do not even provide any guarantees for supervision or protection measures to put on a show. If they do not object to taking supervision or protection measures, it is only because they feel it is necessary to discuss these protection measures in order to confuse public opinion, because they are convinced that these measures cannot be implemented. As the head of the Western bloc, American politicians know that together with West German militarism, they can abandon any supervision measures at any time and any place.

    Incidentally, what is the value of these protection measures? They are actually just a promise from the British government to the French government: to station four divisions of British troops on the European continent.

    Just as Comrade Molotov reminded us here, we Polish people had some experience with British guarantees before the war. When we had to repel German militarism, these guarantees proved to be worthless. The people and the Polish soldiers fought completely isolated. Incidentally, more far-sighted British political leaders, such as former Prime Minister Lloyd George, had no illusions about the fact that this guarantee was just empty talk at that time.

    And what are the lessons of France's experience in 1939-1940? At that time, there were exactly four divisions of British troops stationed in France. It should be pointed out that four divisions of British troops did not save France from disaster, they barely saved themselves.

    But why talk about the value of these guarantees and supervision today, when the whole situation has become more dangerous because the German militarists are going to get atomic weapons, guarantees and supervision that have proven completely unsatisfactory in the past?

    British Foreign Secretary Eden insists today that the British guarantee and supervision system will enable the Paris Agreements to protect Western European countries from the threat of unlimited German armament.

    It should be pointed out that twenty-one years ago, when Hitler first came to power, the then British Foreign Secretary Simon also tried to appease public opinion, which was uneasy because of Germany's armament, with empty words published on paper stipulating special clauses to supervise Germany's armament – which was later confirmed.

    The remilitarization of West Germany is a fatal threat to the German people themselves.

    Today, the German nation is experiencing the tragedy of division. Militaristic and aggressive forces are erecting a new wall on the border between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic: a wall of remilitarization. In the German Democratic Republic, part of the German people have experienced a peaceful life for the first time, they cannot hear the sound of the boots of the German army, and they no longer need to bow whenever they meet a sergeant. However, Chancellor Adenauer, in his speech on the so-called "Day of Mourning," put forward a completely different prospect for the German people. This prospect is: "On this day, the German people mourn the seven million people who died during World War II and the two million people who died during World War I...Many of these victims are buried in foreign lands. German graves are scattered in fifty-three countries."

    Everyone knows that twice and a half as many Germans died in World War II as in World War I.

    If the American and German militarists were able to launch a third world war, how many German lives would be sacrificed? And what would that be for? Is it just so that German graves can once again be scattered in more than fifty countries? How can these graves be scattered in so many countries? What prompted German soldiers to run to the territories of fifty-three countries? This is the insatiable ambition of German militarists – German robbers who are obsessed with seizing power and dominating other countries' land, wealth, lives, and labor.

    Must the tragedy of the German people be replayed, one hundred and fifty years after the sons of the German people were sold to British colonialists at a price of three thalers per person to help them defeat the armies of Washington, Lafayette, and Kościuszko? Today, American rulers, who have disgraced the name of Washington, want to buy German mercenaries again. The remilitarization of Germany means that West German politicians and generals, together with their American masters, are preparing for the German people a "Day of Mourning" that is even more terrible than the recently commemorated "Day of Mourning." It also means that they hope to keep Germany divided forever.

    Today, in West Germany, people who until recently did not pay attention to the warnings issued by the German Democratic Republic or other countries of the peace camp are beginning to realize this. In recent talks, the leaders of the German Social Democratic Party have talked about the growing pressure and resistance from the masses to West Germany's remilitarization, which will destroy the prospects for German reunification. The talks of bourgeois political leaders such as former Prime Ministers Wirth, Brüning, and Luther are also very typical. Finally, the growing contradictions within the Bonn coalition government itself are very telling.

    However, there is still a great possibility of implementing a policy that is in the interests of the German people, not in the interests of the American government and a small group of German militarists and revanchists. Implementing this policy can enable the occupying forces to withdraw and can establish a unified and autonomous Germany. Implementing this policy will relieve the German people of the heavy burden of occupation costs and enable them not to use huge resources to build a new "Defense Force" and to maintain and arm this army.

    Despite the great pain that World War II brought us, despite the great disasters that Hitlerism and German militarism inflicted on us, the Polish people have never intended to retaliate and take revenge, and do not intend to do so now. They have already established relations with the German Democratic Republic on the basis of mutual recognition and respect for sovereignty, borders, and mutual recognition and respect for each other's and national rights and interests. There has been a history of peace and friendly coexistence between Poland and the German Democratic Republic for many years. What unites us and the German Democratic Republic is the common desire to strive for peace and the desire to cooperate politically, economically, and culturally. The just and peaceful border along the Oder-Neisse line has linked us together with bonds of friendship. Poland has repeatedly stated that it hopes to maintain good-neighborly relations with the whole of Germany. We have already expressed this attitude in the first statement on the settlement of the German question issued at the Foreign Ministers' Assistants Conference held in London in 1947. We hoped in the past, and we hope now, to maintain peace and friendship as well as economic and cultural relations with a whole, peace-loving Germany that is free from militarism.

    The question now is how to achieve this goal for the common interests of the German people and all their direct neighbors as well as other European countries. I think that the Soviet Union has pointed out the way to achieve this goal in the Berlin Conference and in some diplomatic notes to Western countries in recent months – including the note of October 23 this year.

    There is no need to repeat here to everyone things that everyone already knows. There is now a very clearly explained path to restoring German unity.

    But there is also a path in the opposite direction: the path of ratifying the Paris Agreements. This path will have unprecedented dangerous consequences. First of all, it means maintaining the division of Germany. Maintaining the division of Germany will worsen the international situation in Europe, thereby increasing the danger of war. Secondly, ratifying the Paris Agreements means that some countries are establishing new military blocs to oppose other European countries, including Poland. This will lead to the division of Europe. Allowing an armed West Germany to join the Western European Union and allowing it to join the North Atlantic Treaty, thereby incorporating it into the military bloc of Western countries, will greatly increase the aggressive nature of these agreements. This is the political significance and consequences of the second path – remilitarizing West Germany.

    This must be explained most firmly to the whole of Europe in order to prevent any doubts or illusions from arising. This is what we are doing today at our conference, and we clearly declare: as long as the agreement on remilitarizing West Germany has not been ratified, all paths for countries to consult and peacefully resolve the German question with the participation of Germany are open, and can enable Germany to achieve unification on a democratic and peaceful basis. Ratifying the agreement to rearm West Germany will block these paths. Who will be responsible for the situation that arises as a result, is something that everyone knows.

    This must be explained more firmly and more clearly, because there is an opinion circulating among Western political leaders, or at least someone is trying to create this opinion, saying that ratifying the Paris Agreements is suitable for starting negotiations not only on the German question but also on other issues. This opinion is completely wrong. Those who spread this opinion are afraid of the public's reaction. They know that the public is increasingly firmly demanding that negotiations be held to resolve the German question and other international issues. Therefore, they want to deceive public opinion.

    This is the position taken by the decision-makers of the United States, Britain, and France, not to mention Adenauer. Recently, President Eisenhower, at a press conference in Washington, reiterated this position when answering Prime Minister Mendes-France's suggestion to convene a four-nation conference next year. Eisenhower said at the beginning of his statement that one of the necessary conditions for holding such a conference is that the Paris Agreements must be ratified before such a conference is held. The Prime Ministers and Premiers of France and Britain have also said similar things. These words are based on a well-known theory: negotiations must be conducted on the basis of so-called strength.

    Let's briefly talk about who benefits from this policy of strength. In the current situation, arming West Germany means greatly changing the balance of power in Western countries, damaging France and Britain, because an armed partner will suddenly appear next to them that is constantly reorganizing its armaments at an increasingly rapid pace. And because this partner has close ties with Washington, its position among other Western countries will become increasingly strong. In that case, the Washington-Bonn tandem will really be able to act on the basis of strength to a greater extent than hitherto, but the other party will be their allies in Paris and London, not to mention Brussels, Rome, and The Hague.

      However, those political leaders who believe that they can negotiate with the Soviet Union and the countries of the peace camp from a position of strength are probably incurable dreamers, and history has not taught them any lessons. The powerful camp of peace countries now has nine hundred million people, spans two continents, has the determination to strive for peace, constantly expresses its willingness to negotiate with all countries to strengthen peace, and advocates and implements the principle of peaceful coexistence with all countries regardless of their systems. However, the aggressors of Western countries should clearly understand that those who pursue a policy of strength will definitely run into a wall in front of the peace camp and its people. The people of all countries in the peace camp have unanimously decided to seek new forms of coordination in organizing armed forces and other measures to protect their borders, security, and independence.

      Incidentally, it is not difficult to prove that those who advocate negotiating from a position of strength are engaging in sophistry that everyone can see through. They say that they are striving to negotiate in order to ensure peace and security for the people of all countries, so they intend to revive the German "Defense Force," which endangers peace and undermines security. They say that they hope to solve the German question; therefore, they intend to rebuild the German "Defense Force," which makes it impossible to peacefully resolve the German question.

    In order to further conceal their political conspiracy, the politicians of the North Atlantic Group once again spread the nonsense about the so-called aggressive threat from the countries of the peace camp. This is one of the most absurd and ridiculous nonsense of imperialist propaganda.

    It is surprising that those who have been specializing in war propaganda for many years actually describe the peace camp as aggressive.

    This is not only a disgusting propaganda that undermines the international atmosphere and deceives the people. Wars are made by those who have a definite interest in war. So who is interested in armaments and war? Who brings huge profits to war and conquering foreign lands? The answer is obvious: first of all, the companies that manufacture armaments and the enterprises associated with them – war brings them billions of dollars in profits. They are the main beneficiaries of this bloody business. During the two world wars, they were given the appropriate title of merchants of death, and this was not without reason.

    The pioneers who advocate West Germany's remilitarization shamelessly admit that British industrialists also hope to arm West Germany, because in this way the industry of West Germany can be partially diverted to military production, thereby reducing the danger of competition from West German exports in the world market. Let the Germans manufacture munitions, weapons, and destructive tools, even though these things may cause the deaths of the inhabitants of the British Isles, British men and women, as in 1914-1918 and 1939-1945.

    But for these people, what is important is that more profits will continue to flow into the pockets of British exporters, because German competition may be reduced! Germany will engage in manufacturing guns, bombs, V-1 and V-2 guided missiles, and even atomic bombs.

    Among the illusory arguments used by Western politicians to deceive public opinion, there is also, for example, the fatalistic saying that is popular in France, which presupposes that things are unchangeable and declares that arming West Germany is inevitable.

    The French Premier even tried to use this saying to prove that Franco-German friendship is necessary. This is a strange friendship, the foundation of which is to arm the troops who are the deadly enemy of France, rather than developing international cooperation in a way that would promote genuine international reconciliation.

    This inevitability theory of arming Germany is the Sedang fatalism, the so-called fatalism that France's defeat is inevitable. Up to now, French history does not know what other result there is for the growth of German militarism; and it will never know. Therefore, when the French Premier puts forward the argument that there is a need to rebuild the German "Defense Force," he is taking on the responsibility of reviving the mortal enemy of his people. In doing so, the French Premier has become very polite, and taking into account his role in accelerating the rebuilding of the German "Defense Force," he generously "promised" to establish the so-called "Eastern Group," thus showing in fact who wants two hostile groups to exist in Europe.

    However, this seemingly fatalistic theory of defending the revival of German militarism is based on a wicked deception. After World War II, conditions emerged that made it possible to eradicate German militarism and eliminate its dangers forever. Currently, Atlantic aggressors are deliberately fostering this militarism in West Germany. Militarism is being cultivated and carefully nurtured so that it can take root, develop, and flourish. There has probably never been any other example in history of such a conscious attempt to revive evil forces. These evil forces were defeated not long ago in a long and disastrous war. We must say with absolute firmness: there is no doubt who is preparing another disaster for the world: it is those who deliberately revive the enemy of mankind – Hitler's militarism.

    Poland's contribution to European security is the treaty of alliance and mutual assistance it has concluded with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. Its contribution to European security is its friendly cooperation with the German Democratic Republic. Our border, demarcated on the Oder-Neisse line, has deprived the German aggressive forces of a bridgehead for "advancing eastward." Our inviolable Oder-Neisse border is now an element of peace and security in Europe, and a major factor in peaceful cooperation with the German people.

    Poland has also proposed to France to conclude a treaty of alliance and mutual assistance, which would strengthen the security of both countries, thereby strengthening the security of Europe.

    Poland's peaceful policy is expressed in our notes to Germany's neighbors and the major powers. In its notes, Poland has called for a peaceful resolution of the German question. For the sake of European security, Poland has expressed its support for the Soviet proposal to establish a European collective security system in its notes of March 9, August 8, and November 16 this year.

    Poland also actively participates in many international organizations, and also promotes the cause of strengthening peace.

    The people of Europe, still feeling the serious consequences of World War II ten years later, and feeling the heavy burden of international tensions caused by the "Cold War" policy launched and carried out by Western countries, warmly hope that there will be lasting peace and security on our continent.

    The only correct way to achieve this goal is to establish a universal collective security system. Collective security will bring the people of all countries closer together, will eliminate tensions in international relations, and will lead to disarmament. This is the program put forward by the Soviet Union and other countries in the peace camp.

    However, some people are wrong to regard our countries' outstretched hands to them with peaceful wishes as a sign of our weakness or willingness to abandon our sovereignty. There is nothing more absurd than such a conclusion. Of course, coexistence does not mean that one party can give orders to the other. It is completely wrong for anyone to expect to be able to speak to our countries from a position of strength or to succeed in this regard.

    The governments and parliaments of Western European countries must be told clearly and unequivocally what dangers will be caused by ratifying the agreements on arming West Germany.

    We should also point out the illusions of some governments, which believe that their countries will not be affected by German remilitarization if they avoid participating in guaranteeing security. The fate of countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway in the last war is a vivid example of what happens to this kind of illusion. German militarism is the enemy of all countries.

    If Western politicians were to disregard all the historical experience of the people of all countries, and if they were to ratify the Paris Agreements against the public opinion of European countries, then a new situation would arise, requiring peace-loving countries to take new paths and means to guarantee their security.

    This new situation undoubtedly requires increasing the defense capabilities of our countries.

    The position of the government of the Polish People's Republic on this issue is very clear.

    The new measures must be effective, must fully meet the requirements of protecting our people from the threat posed by the rearmed West Germany.

    When all countries that implement a policy of peace and international security unite their forces to prevent new dangers, when the coordination of these forces is guaranteed, when the organizational form that unites our defense measures is determined, then, the effectiveness of the measures we take will be greater.

    On behalf of the delegation of the government of the Polish People's Republic, I express my belief that our conference will definitely be able to determine the direction of our common efforts, which we all agree on in this regard, in order to protect our people from aggression.

    Faced with the threat of armed new Hitlerite revanchists, in the face of new German aggression, the Polish people are united and fully determined to take all actions that the current situation requires them to take in order to prevent this threat, prevent aggression, protect their peaceful labor, the further development of their country, and the improvement of their living standards and welfare, and to make their contribution to the cause of defending peace.

    The Polish people's unity on this issue is based on historical experience, is the unity with all people who are equally prepared to defend peace and security, and is the unity that expresses full solidarity with the entire peace camp, with the Soviet Union, and with the countries that are fighting for peace.

### 十一月二十九日在欧洲会议上  西伦凯维兹的讲话

1954-12-02

专栏：

    十一月二十九日在欧洲会议上
    西伦凯维兹的讲话敬爱的同志们：
    波兰人民共和国政府代表团出席欧洲国家会议，来跟其他同新的形势有切身利害关系的国家共同讨论保障欧洲和平和安全的措施，这种新形势是由于西方国家的政府企图用一切办法重建侵略性的新希特勒“国防军”这一阴谋所造成的。
    在批准巴黎协定的基础上复活新希特勒“国防军”和使西德重新军国主义化威胁着波兰的安全，威胁着波兰人民，威胁着和平事业。
    对于这样一种危险，波兰人民和波兰政府都不能置之不理；相反地，他们必须采取一切措施，集中一切力量避免这种危险。
    苏联所提出的召开讨论这个问题的会议的建议，从一开始起，就是符合于波兰政府希望同其他国家一起讨论有关欧洲安全的问题的愿望的。
    波兰政府十分重视这次会议，并且准备尽自己的一份力量，实施大家同意的原则，以便配合我们的力量，来在新的形势下保障爱好和平的国家的共同安全，从而也就是保障波兰和波兰边境的安全，保障波兰人民的安全。
    波兰人民的坚决立场得到了其他国家的全力支持，这些国家根据它们的历史经验和对正在复活德国的新希特勒军队的美帝国主义者的侵略计划——这无疑地威胁着波兰和欧洲其他各国，而且不仅是欧洲其他各国的人民——的合乎实际的共同估计，正和我们一起，表示它们要阻止发生这种危险的不屈不挠的意志。
    波兰人民充分了解使一个侵略性的德国重新军国主义化的危险，他们在数以千计的大小集会上十分坚决地表明了他们对这个问题的态度。波兰人民的意志表现在波兰政府代表团参加这个会议的行动上，并且表现在这个代表团对苏联外交部长莫洛托夫的演说中所表明的苏联立场的充分支持中。
    德国军国主义并不是第一次以无法估计的灾难威胁欧洲各国人民。自从军国主义和军国主义分子最后在德国得逞以来，欧洲实际上一直处在经常的不安状态中。德国在一八七○—一八七一年对法国的侵略只是德国军国主义者以后在欧洲所从事的种种活动——政治压力、侵略措施和武装进攻——的序幕。在四分之三个世纪中的三次大规模的侵略战争——两次变成了引起数千万生命损失和不可估计的破坏的世界战争——已经足够证明德国军国主义对欧洲、对世界、对文明和对世界文化的危险性了。
    但是，德国军国主义从来没有掩饰过它的目的，它一直是露骨而无耻地在表达着它的愿望的。人们能够举出负责的德国政客或军人所发表的许多厚颜无耻地向世界挑战的谈话。例如：德国军国主义的一个魁首、德国帝国主义军队的组织者之一、陆军元帅莫尔基曾发表过这样的言论：“持久和平是一种梦想，而且甚至不是一种美丽的梦想。战争是地球上的神圣使命的一部分。”
    这不仅仅是一种恫吓，这是一种在哲学上为像侵略战争这样的危害人类的滔天罪行辩解的企图。这是一种打算把这种罪行捧到神圣使命的地位的企图。从莫尔基时代直到今天，这种哲学一直就是德国军国主义者的座右铭。
    全欧洲的普通人民老早就懂得了关于德国军国主义的这种真理了。为了这一点，他们用不着去研究莫尔基或希特勒的著作。鼓吹莫尔基这种看法的人在七十年中曾三度企图对欧洲各国人民进行实例教学。
    和德国毗邻的国家的普通人民都没有忘记这一点，而且也不可能忘记这一点。第二次世界大战的恐怖年代的记忆仍然使每一个正直的人（法国人、俄国人、捷克人、斯洛伐克人、南斯拉夫人和英国人——每一个体验过战争恐怖的人）不寒而栗。奥斯威辛、利台斯和奥拉多尔、夷为平地的犹太人街和被摧毁的华沙、斯大林格勒、考文垂以及其他几十个城市是这种恐怖的证据，西方外交家的任何数量的狡猾的诡辩也缩小不了这种恐怖的规模。这些西方外交家们目前正在设法制订武装被希特勒的经验所丰富了的莫尔基的崇拜者们的计划。
    对于祖国曾变成第二次世界大战的第一个战场的波兰人来说，什么论据也一点不能使我们相信：重新武装德国军国主义者不致引起把我们的国家和欧洲所有其他的国家投入另一次灾难的危险。就在进攻我们国家的前夕，阿道夫·希特勒颁布了一项命令，这种命令是人类史上所从来没有见过的：
  “毁灭波兰是当前的目的……我将给你们一个发动战争的宣传借口。不要管这个借口听来有没有道理。要残酷无情。强权就是公理。要极端残酷地行动。完全毁灭波兰是我们的战争目标”。
    当西方国家的“保证”还停留在纸上的时候，希特勒战争罪犯执行了希特勒的命令，使波兰人民流了血。
    这个命令执行得很彻底。
    在六年当中，它使我们牺牲了六百万人，国家、城市和乡村遭到了可怕的毁灭。有谁能容忍使这种情况可能重演呢？至于波兰人民，他们是反对这样一种可能性的。
    同时也值得提一下捷克斯洛伐克的例子，缔结无耻的慕尼黑协定的结果使得捷克斯洛伐克还在战争正式开始以前就落入了希特勒禽兽的掌握中，捷克斯洛伐克经历了活生生地被逐渐撕裂成碎片的所有的恐怖遭遇，一直到最后，希特勒破坏了他在慕尼黑向西方政治家们所提出的最庄严的保证，攫取了其余的部分。
    甚至签订这个协定的英国首相在一九三九年三月十五日以后也不得不说他被骗了，以便在舆论面前为他自己辩解。难道我们能够忘记这个再清楚不过地说明了德国军国主义提出的保证的价值的历史教训吗？
    在反纳粹侵略者的战争中首当其冲的苏联，重新军国主义化这个字眼会引起无比的愤怒和使人民握紧了拳头，这难道是不可理解的吗？因为正是他们——苏联战士们——曾不得不跋涉欧洲，从高加索走到柏林给德国军国主义以决定性的打击。
    或者让我们看看法国的历史吧。法国在七十年间遭到过三次侵略。巴黎两次受到胜利者铁蹄的蹂躏，遭到德国“国防军”长靴的践踏。每一次侵略都使法国牺牲了大量的生命，使法国整个青年一代付出了他们的鲜血。在两次世界大战之间的期间，法国政治领袖们采取了一个带给了法国人民以巨大灾难的步骤；人民立刻就感觉到了这种步骤的后果——血腥而残酷的后果：在被占领和维奇政权的年代，法国人民的民族自尊心蒙受了无比的屈辱。
    尽管这样，但是法国国内现在又有一些准备拥护复活罪恶的德国军国主义军队的政治领袖们了。
    比利时也经历过类似的考验，它曾两度沦为德国军国主义分子的牺牲品，就在这以前德国军国主义分子曾经保证要尊重它的中立。意大利从它自己的经验中同样也领教了和德国军国主义“同盟”的价值，它参加这种“同盟”的结果是流血和被它自己的“盟国”所蹂躏。
    饱受德国军国主义之害的欧洲各国人民的经验是惨痛的。波兰人民和爱好和平的其他国家的人民已经能够从这种经验中得出正确的结论：对于同时容纳各国自由人民和德国军国主义存在来说，世界是太小了。
    这些为各国人民都能理解的结论是不合乎某些想再度把德国军国主义引上历史舞台的西方政客们的胃口的。这就是伦敦和巴黎协定的本质，任何东西都掩盖不了这种本质。
    那些从莫尔基到希特勒时代决定德国军国主义政策的势力现在又在西德抬头了。这些势力就是邱吉尔不仅在两次世界大战期间曾经企图依靠的，并且，正如他自己现在所承认的，也是当反希特勒主义的战争还在高潮的时候，他在暗算他的盟国苏联的背信弃义的计划中所考虑到的。
    每一个熟悉过去一百年的历史的有思想的政治家都必须认识到——不论承认不承认——一旦让德国军国主义势力自由行动，那就没有任何人能够控制他们了，就是那些应对这种形势负责的人也控制不了他们。
    大家都知道，第二次世界大战爆发以后不久，在两次大战期间的二十年中一直在英、美、法帝国主义集团的支持下准备东进的德国军国主义立刻就把战火蔓延到西方国家的领土上了。德国军国主义分子愿意由他们自己来决定他们进攻的方向，正如他们的保护人有机会所亲自看到的那样。
    真的，在伦敦和巴黎会议上所一再重复的“保证”和“监督”这种字眼就是最好的证据，证明：西欧政客们的良心是不安宁的。
    如果德国军国主义的伙伴们不得不谋求用各种预防措施和“保证”办法来防备他，那他真是一个可怕的同盟者。
    显然，所有关于“监督”和“保证”的叫嚷的主要目的是要缓和，或者说得更确切些，是要欺骗对复活德国军国主义所带来的危险感到非常不安的舆论。西欧军国主义分子的靠山是美帝国主义侵略集团，对于西德军国主义分子的计划，他们是没有任何控制或限制措施的。对一心要寻找借口来发动新的国际冒险的美国侵略集团来说，新“国防军”是一个无可估价的同盟者，因为这个同盟者是完全没有任何“顾虑”的，是愿意做任何事情的。美国侵略集团需要武装西德，以便假德国军国主义分子之手来执行他们的军事计划。不管美国政策的领袖们怎样企图以西欧国家（这些国家他们硬说是处在危险中）的保护者的姿态出现，他们是掩饰不了上面这个事实的，西欧国家处在危险中的事实当然是无庸置辩的，但是，这个危险的唯一无二的来源是美国的战争计划，依照这个计划，整个欧洲都要变成一个新的战场。
    对美国帝国主义集团来说，新“国防军”不只是执行他们的侵略计划的工具，它也是欧洲的宪兵。这正是他们愿意托以维持西欧国家的“秩序”的重任的力量，而在这些国家中，人民已经发出了反对侵略和战争、反对原子弹和氢弹、反对德国军国主义和要求和平共处、要求缓和国际紧张局势、要求禁止大规模毁灭性武器、要求裁军和和平的响亮的呼声。
    当法国舆论打击了欧洲军，并且获得了印度支那停战的时候，帝国主义集团遭到了惨重的失败。现在帝国主义集团正在设法破坏妨碍他们计划的实行的欧洲各国人民的主权。西德占领制度的保留，巴黎协定中规定的可以干涉各国内政的特别条款，对西德经济命脉的控制——这一切的目的就是要使德国西部完全附属于美国，并且利用它作为推行美国帝国主义政策的工具。这一切就是为了加强美国对法国和其他西欧国家的压力，从而确保美国对整个西欧的独一无二的控制。
    美国侵略集团认为，波恩“国防军”将会为他们的利益行动，并且能够压制对侵略者构成极大威胁的西欧各国人民的不满情绪，所以，美国政客们就万事都袒护他们的波恩伙伴。他们甚至不为任何监督或者保障办法提供保证来装装样子。如果说他们并不反对采取监督或保障办法的话，那也只是因为他们认为有必要讨论讨论这些保障办法以便迷惑舆论，因为他们深信这些办法是实行不了的。作为西方集团的头子的美国政客们知道，同西德军国主义在一起，他们随时随地都可以抛弃任何监督办法。
    附带说一说，这些保障办法又有什么价值呢？它们实际上只是英国政府给法国政府的一个诺言：在欧洲大陆上驻扎四师英国军队。
    就像莫洛托夫同志在这里提醒我们的一样，我们波兰人在战前就对英国的保证有过一些经验了。当我们必须击退德国军国主义的时候，这些保证就证明是毫无价值的。人民和波兰士兵们完全孤立地作战。附带说一说，比较有远见的英国政治领袖如前首相劳埃德·乔治早在那个时候对这种保证只是空谈这一事实就没有任何错觉了。
    而法国在一九三九—一九四○年的经验教训又是怎样的呢？在那个时候，恰恰有四师英国军队驻扎在法国境内。应该指出，四师英国军队并没有把法国从灾难中救出来，只是勉强救了他们自己。
    但是为什么要在整个形势因为德国军国主义者将要得到原子武器而变得更危险了的今天来谈在过去已经证明完全不能令人满意的这些保证和监督的价值呢？
    英国外交大臣艾登今天硬说，英国的保证和监督制度将使得巴黎协定能够保护西欧国家，使它们不受到德国无限制武装的威胁。
    应该指出，在二十一年以前希特勒开始执政的时候，那时的英国外交大臣西蒙也同样企图用发表在纸上规定对德国的武装加以监督的特殊条款的空洞言论——这是后来证实的——来宽慰因德国的武装而不安的舆论。
    西德的重新军国主义化对德国人民自己是一个致命的威胁。
    今天，德意志民族正在经历着分裂的悲剧。军国主义和侵略势力正在德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的边界上竖起一道新墙：重新军国主义化的墙。在德意志民主共和国内，德国人民的一部分已经第一次体验到了和平生活，他们听不见德国军队皮靴的响声，他们不再需要一遇到军士就鞠躬了。但是，阿登纳总理在所谓“哀悼日”发表的演说中却为德国人民提出了一种完全不同的前景。这种前景就是：“在这一天，德国人民悼念在第二次世界大战期间死亡的七百万人和在第一次世界大战中死亡的二百万人。……这些牺牲者中有许多人都埋葬在外国的土地上。德国人的坟墓散布在五十三个国家中。”
    大家知道：在第二次世界大战中死亡的德国人比第一次世界大战中死亡的德国人要多两倍半。
    如果美国和德国军国主义分子们得以发动第三次世界大战的话，那将要牺牲多少德国人的生命呢？而且那又是为了什么呢？难道就是为了使德国人的坟墓再度遍布在五十多个国家中吗？这些坟墓怎么会遍布在这样多国家中呢？是什么促使德国士兵跑到五十三个国家的领土上去的呢？这是德国军国主义分子——妄想夺取其他国家的土地、财富、生命和劳动的德国强盗们——的夺取权力和统治的贪得无厌的野心。
    在一百五十年以前，德国人民的儿子以三塔勒一个人的价钱被卖给英国殖民主义者去帮助他们击败华盛顿、拉斐特和科邱希科的军队，难道德国人民的这种悲剧还必须重演吗？今天，辱没了华盛顿的名字的美国统治者又想收买德国雇佣军了。德国的重新军国主义化意味着西德的政客和将军们正在和他们的美国主子一起，为德国人民准备一个比最近纪念的这个“哀悼日”更加可怕的“哀悼日”。这还意味着，他们希望使德国永远分裂下去。
    今天，在西德，直到最近以前还不注意德意志民主共和国或和平阵营其他国家发出的警告的人们正在开始认识到这一点。德国社会民主党的领袖们在最近的谈话中都谈到了群众对于将使德国统一的前途被毁灭掉的西德重新军国主义化的日益增长的压力和反抗。像前总理维尔特、布吕宁和路得这些资产阶级政治领袖们的谈话也都是非常典型的。最后，波恩联合政府内部的日益增长的矛盾本身就是很足以说明问题的。
    然而，仍然存在着巨大的可能性实行一种符合于德国人民的利益而不是符合于美国政府和一小撮德国军国主义者和复仇主义者的利益的政策。实行这种政策能够使占领军撤退，能够建立起一个统一的和自主的德国来。实行这种政策将解除德国人民所背负着的占领费的重担，使他们不需要把巨大的资源用于建立一支新的“国防军”，以及用于维持和武装这支军队。
    尽管第二次世界大战给我们带来这样大的痛苦，尽管希特勒主义和德国军国主义使我们遭受了巨大的灾难，但是，波兰人民过去从来没有，而且现在也不打算报复和复仇。他们已经在互相承认和尊重主权、边界，互相承认和尊重彼此的和民族的权力和利益的基础上同德意志民主共和国建立了关系。波兰和德意志民主共和国之间已经有了多年的和平和友好共处的历史。把我们和德意志民主共和国团结在一起的就是争取和平的共同愿望和要求在政治、经济和文化方面进行合作的愿望。沿着奥得—尼斯分界线的公正的和平边界已经用友谊的纽带把我们联结在一起。波兰一再表示，它希望同全德国保持睦邻关系。我们已经在一九四七年在伦敦举行的外长助理会议上发表的关于解决德国问题的第一个声明中表明了这种态度。我们过去希望，现在也希望同一个整个的、爱好和平的和摆脱了军国主义的德国保持和平和友谊以及经济和文化的关系。
    现在的问题在于如何为了德国人民和他们的一切直接邻国以及其他欧洲国家的共同利益来达到这个目标。我认为，苏联在柏林会议上以及在最近几个月中致西方国家的一些外交照会——包括今年十月二十三日的照会——中已指出了达到这个目标的道路。
    现在没有必要在这里向各位来重复大家都已知道的事情。现在已经有一条解释得非常清楚的恢复德国统一的道路。
    但是也有一条通往相反方向的道路：批准巴黎协定的道路。这条道路会产生空前的危险后果。首先，它意味着保持德国的分裂。保持德国的分裂将使欧洲的国际局势恶化，因而增加战争的危险。其次，批准巴黎协定就意味着由一些国家建立起新的军事集团来反对另外一些欧洲国家，包括波兰在内。这便会导致欧洲的分裂。让一个武装的西德参加西欧联盟和让它参加北大西洋公约，从而把它并入西方国家的军事集团的做法，将大大增加这些协定的侵略性质。这就是第二条道路——重新使西德军国主义化——的政治意义和后果。
    必须最坚决地向整个欧洲说明这一点，以防止产生任何怀疑或幻想。这就是我们今天正在我们的会议上做的事，我们清楚地宣布：只要关于使西德重新军国主义化的协定没有被批准，在有德国参加的情况下由各国协商和平解决德国问题的一切道路都是开放着的，并且能够使德国在民主和和平的基础上实现统一。批准重新武装西德的协定，就将堵塞这些道路。因此而产生的局势将由谁负责，是大家知道的。
    必须更加坚决、更加明确地说明这一点，因为西方政治领袖中间流行着一种意见，至少有人企图制造这种意见，说什么批准巴黎协定对于开始不仅讨论德国问题而且讨论其他问题的谈判，都是适合的。这种意见是根本错误的。散播这种意见的人害怕公众的反应。他们知道，公众越来越坚决地要求举行谈判，来解决德国问题和其他国际问题。因此，他们就想欺骗舆论。
    美、英、法三国的决策者所采取的立场就是这样，阿登纳是更不要说了。最近，艾森豪威尔总统在华盛顿的记者招待会上在回答孟戴斯—弗朗斯总理关于明年召开四国会议的建议时，再度说明了这种立场。艾森豪威尔在声明的一开头就说，举行这种会议的必要条件之一就是，在举行这种会议之前，先要使巴黎协定获得批准。法、英两国的总理和首相也讲过这样的话。这些话的根据就是一种大家都知道的理论：必须凭借所谓实力地位进行谈判。
    我们先来简单谈谈从这种实力地位政策中得到好处的是谁吧。在目前的情况下，武装西德就意味着大大改变西方国家的力量对比，损害法国和英国，因为在它们身旁会突然出现一个以越来越大的速度不断地整顿军备的武装伙伴。而由于这个伙伴同华盛顿有密切关系，它在其他西方国家中间的地位将越来越强大。那样一来，华盛顿—波恩搭挡就真的能够在比迄今为止更大的程度上凭借实力地位行动了，不过对方却是它们在巴黎和伦敦的盟友，布鲁塞尔、罗马和海牙就更不要说了。
      但是，认为能够从实力地位出发同苏联和和平阵营国家进行谈判的那些政治领袖大概是不可救药的空想家，历史没有给他们任何教训。强大的和平国家阵营现在拥有九亿人民，横跨两个大陆，有着争取和平的决心，不断地表示它愿意同所有的国家谈判以加强和平，主张并且实现不问各国的制度为何而同各国共处的原则。但是，西方国家的侵略分子应当清楚地了解，奉行实力地位政策的人一定会在和平阵营和它的各国人民面前碰壁的。和平阵营各国人民已一致下定决心要寻求他们在组织武装部队方面进行配合的新形式和保护他们的国境、安全和独立的其他措施。
      附带说一句，不难证明，主张从实力地位出发来进行谈判的人是在进行人人都能看穿的诡辩。他们说，他们努力要进行谈判以求保障各国人民的和平和安全，因此，他们打算复活危害和平和破坏安全的德国“国防军”。他们说，他们希望解决德国问题；因此，他们打算重建使德国问题不可能和平解决的德国“国防军”。
    北大西洋集团的政客们为了进一步掩饰他们的政治阴谋，又一次传播关于和平阵营国家的所谓侵略威胁的鬼话。这是帝国主义宣传最荒唐可笑的鬼话之一。
    令人惊奇的是那些许多年来一直专门以进行战争宣传为职业的人竟然把和平阵营说成是侵略的。
    这不仅仅是一种破坏国际气氛和欺骗人民的令人作呕的宣传而已。战争是由那些在战争中有肯定利益的人制造的。那么谁对军备和战争有兴趣呢？战争和征服外国的土地为谁带来巨额利润呢？答案是明显的：首先是制造军备的公司和与它们有联系的企业——战争使它们得到亿万元的利润。它们是这种血腥的生意中的主要得益者。在两次大战期间，他们得到死亡商人这样的恰当的称号，这并不是无因的。
    主张西德重新军国主义化的先锋们无耻地承认，英国的工业家也希望武装西德，因为这样一来便可以把西德的工业部分地转入军事生产的轨道，从而减少西德出口货在世界市场上竞争的危险。让他们德国人制造军火、武器和毁灭性的工具吧，虽然这些东西可能造成英伦三岛居民，英国的男女的死亡，像在一九一四—一九一八年和一九三九—一九四五年那样。
    但是对这些人说来，重要的是更多的利润将源源不绝地滚进英国出口货制造商的腰包，因为德国方面的竞争也许会减少了！德国将从事制造枪炮、炸弹、V一和V二式的定向飞弹，甚至原子弹。
    在西方政客用来欺骗舆论的虚妄的论点中，还有例如在法国流行的宿命论的说法，这种宿命论的说法预先假定事情是无可改变的，宣称武装西德是不可避免的。
    法国总理甚至企图利用这种说法来证明法德亲善是必要的。这是一种奇怪的亲善，它的基础是武装作为法国的死敌的部队，而不是发展会促进国际真正修好的那种方式的国际合作。
    这种武装德国不可避免论是塞当（第一次欧战德军大败法军处——译注）宿命论，是所谓法国失败不可避免的宿命论。到现在为止，法国历史还不知道德国军国主义的成长有什么其他结果；而且也将永远不会知道。因此，法国总理提出需要重建德国“国防军”的论点时，他就承担了复活他的人民的死敌的责任。在这样做的时候，法国总理变得非常客气，由于考虑到他在加速重建德国“国防军”方面的作用，他慷慨“答应”建立所谓“东方集团”，因此表明了事实上是谁希望在欧洲存在两个敌对的集团。
    但是，这种替德国军国主义复活的所谓不可避免性辩护的表面上是宿命论性质的理论，是以一个罪恶的骗局为基础的。在第二次世界大战后，出现了有可能铲除德国军国主义和永远消除它的危害性的条件。目前，大西洋侵略分子正在西德处心积虑地扶植这种军国主义。军国主义正在受到培植和细心的滋养，以便能够生根、发展和茂盛。历史上也许从来没有过比这更有意识地企图使邪恶势力复活的任何其他的例子了。这种邪恶势力不久以前才在一场长期的和灾难性的战争中被击败。我们必须绝对坚决地说：谁在替世界准备另一场灾难是毫无疑问的：这就是那些蓄意使人类的敌人——希特勒军国主义——复活的人。
    波兰对欧洲安全的贡献是它同苏联和人民民主国家缔结的同盟互助条约。它对欧洲安全的贡献是它同德意志民主共和国的友好合作。我们的边界划定在奥得-尼斯边界线，剥夺了德国侵略势力“东进”的桥头堡。我们的不可侵犯的奥得-尼斯边界线现在是欧洲和平和安全的一个要素，是同德国人民和平合作的主要因素。
    波兰也已向法国建议缔结一个同盟互助条约，这会加强两国的安全，从而加强欧洲的安全。
    波兰的和平政策表现在我们致德国的邻国和各大国的照会中。波兰在它的照会中都要求和平解决德国问题。为了欧洲安全，波兰在今年三月九日、八月八日和十一月十六日的照会中表示支持苏联提出的建立欧洲集体安全体系的倡议。
    波兰积极参加许多国际组织，也促进了加强和平的事业。
    欧洲人民在十年后的今天仍然感到第二次世界大战的严重后果，感到西方国家发动和进行的“冷战”政策所引起的国际紧张局势的沉重负担，他们热烈希望我们大陆上有稳固的和平和安全。
    要达到这一目标的唯一正确的道路是建立一个普遍的集体安全体系。集体安全会使各国人民更加靠拢，会消除国际关系中的紧张局势，会导致裁减军备。这就是苏联和和平阵营其他国家所提出的纲领。
    可是，有些人把我们几国怀着和平愿望向他们伸出的手看作是我们软弱或愿意放弃我们主权的表示，他们是错了。再没有比这样一个结论更荒谬了。当然，共处并没有一方可以向另一方发号施令的意思。有人指望可能从实力地位上来对我们几国说话或在这点上获得成功，这种打算是完全错误的。
    必须清楚而明确地告诉西欧国家政府和议会，批准关于武装西德的协定会造成什么样的危险。
    我们还应当着重指明一些政府的幻想，它们以为，它们的国家避免参加保障安全就不会受到德国重新军国主义化的影响。像比利时、荷兰、丹麦和挪威这些国家在上次大战中的命运，就是这种幻想的遭遇的生动例子。德国军国主义是所有的国家的敌人。
    如果西方的政客们竟然无视各国人民的全部历史经验，如果他们竟然违背欧洲各国的舆论而批准巴黎协定，那么就将产生一种新的局势，要求爱好和平的国家采取新的途径和手段来保障它们的安全。
    这种新的局势毫无疑问地要求增加我们各国的防御力量。
    波兰人民共和国政府在这个问题上立场很明确。
    新的措施必须是有效的、必须充分符合于保卫我们的人民免受重新武装西德所产生的威胁的要求。
    当执行和平和国际安全的政策的一切国家，把自己的力量联合起来以防止新的危险的时候，当这些力量的配合有了保证的时候，当联合我们的防御措施的组织形式确定了的时候，那么，我们所采取的措施的效力就会更大。
    我代表波兰人民共和国政府代表团表示相信，我们的会议一定可以在这方面确定我们大家一致同意的共同努力的方针，以保卫我们的人民不受侵略。
    在武装新希特勒复仇主义分子的威胁面前，在新的德国侵略的面前，波兰人民团结一致，有充分的决心来采取目前形势要求他们采取的一切行动，以防止这种威胁，防止侵略、保卫他们的和平劳动、他们国家的进一步发展和他们的生活水平和福利的增进并且对保卫和平的事业作出他们的贡献。
    波兰人民在这个问题上的团结是以历史经验为基础的，是同所有同样准备保卫和平和安全的人民的团结，是表示同整个和平阵营、同苏联、同为和平而斗争的国家充分一致的团结。
