Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respected Mr. Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen:

We are greatly honored that His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu, at the invitation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, has come to visit our country on behalf of the Government of the Union of Burma. On behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China, I extend a warm welcome to our distinguished guest, His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu, and through His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu, I express my sincere respect to the Government and people of the Union of Burma.

Burma and China have a long history of relations. Our two countries are not only close neighbors, but our two peoples also have kinship. Since ancient times, the people of our two countries have begun friendly cultural and economic exchanges. In modern times, the anti-colonialist struggles waged by the people of our two countries to win their own independence and freedom have further strengthened the mutual sympathy and concern between the two peoples, and thus deepened the traditional friendship between the two countries. After the Chinese people overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism and established their own country, Burma was one of the first Asian countries to recognize the People's Republic of China. Burma has also consistently upheld justice and advocated the restoration of China's legitimate status and rights in the United Nations. The Chinese people will not forget Burma's just stand and friendly expressions towards New China. China has also always adopted a friendly and understanding attitude towards Burma in its relations. Respected Mr. Prime Minister, during your visit to our country, you will personally experience the friendship of the Chinese people towards the Burmese people.

Burma and China have not only experienced foreign colonial aggression and oppression, but also, as a result of this aggression and oppression, both of our countries are in a state of economic backwardness. Therefore, in order to build our own countries and get rid of backwardness and poverty, the people of our two countries are continuing to strive for an international environment of peace and against foreign interference. This provides a basis for the friendly cooperation between the people of our two countries. From the day of its founding, the unwavering policy of the People's Republic of China in international affairs has been to strive for the noble goals of world peace and human progress. China's efforts at the Geneva Conference to restore peace in Indochina were supported by Burma, and Burma's role in promoting the Indochina armistice at the Colombo Conference has also deeply impressed the Chinese people. In June of this year, the Prime Ministers of China and Burma issued a joint statement confirming that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are the basic principles guiding relations between China and Burma. Our two countries are implementing these principles in our mutual relations, as exemplified by the Sino-Burmese trade agreement and barter protocol signed by government representatives of our two countries in Rangoon in April and Beijing in November this year. The equal and mutually beneficial relationship between our two countries, rather than an unequal and mutually harmful one, powerfully demonstrates to the world that countries with different social systems and different ideologies not only should but also can coexist peacefully, without exception for any country.

However, some countries are unwilling to see the solidarity and cooperation between Asian countries and are constantly trying to create division and hostility between Asian countries. Everyone knows who is instigating the Chiang Kai-shek clique to threaten the security of our two countries and undermine peace in Asia. Everyone also knows who does not welcome the restoration of peace in Indochina and does not welcome the efforts of China, Burma, and India to establish and expand peace zones based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We have all seen that the methods used in Europe of organizing hostile military blocs, creating division, and interfering in internal affairs are similarly applied to Asia. One example that directly harms the interests of the people of Asian countries is the formation of the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Group." In his speech at the Meimiao Military Officers' Annual Meeting on September 13 this year, Prime Minister U Nu said that the formation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization "increases the chance of a Third World War." This statement is entirely correct. The Chinese people are firmly opposed to war, but will never be intimidated by the threats of war blocs. The Chinese people fervently desire peace, but will never beg for peace from war blocs at the expense of their sovereignty and interests. We believe that only by strengthening the unity of peace-loving countries and people in the world and thwarting all war threats and conspiracies can we ensure world peace and security and create conditions for the prosperity and happiness of all countries. We firmly believe that this is not only the wish of the Chinese people, but also the common wish of Burma and other peace-loving countries and people.

Respected Mr. Prime Minister, your visit to China will undoubtedly enhance mutual understanding and friendly cooperation between our two countries, and will therefore be conducive to peace in Asia and the world. We are willing to work together with the Burmese government and Prime Minister U Nu to implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to establish and expand peace zones, and to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

Let us raise a glass to Sino-Burmese friendship, to peace in Asia and the world, and to the health of the President of the Union of Burma, Dr. Ba U!

### 周恩来总理的讲话

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的总理先生各位女士、各位先生：
    吴努总理阁下应中华人民共和国政府的邀请，代表缅甸联邦政府前来我国访问，我们感到十分荣幸。我谨代表中华人民共和国政府和人民向我们的贵宾、吴努总理阁下表示热忱的欢迎，并通过吴努总理阁下向缅甸联邦政府和人民表示衷心的敬意。
    缅甸和中国有悠久的历史关系。我们两国不仅是紧密的邻邦，我们两国人民还有亲戚的关系。从古代起，我们两国人民就开始了文化上和经济上的友好往来。近代以来，我们两国人民为了争取自己的独立和自由而进行的反殖民主义的斗争，更加使两国人民互相同情和关怀，因而也加深了两国人民的传统友谊。中国人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，建立了自己的国家以后，缅甸是最早承认中华人民共和国的亚洲国家之一。缅甸又一贯主张正义，赞成恢复中国在联合国中的合法地位和权利。缅甸的这种公正立场和对新中国的友好表示，是中国人民所不能忘记的。中国在对缅甸的关系上也一向采取友好和谅解的态度。尊敬的总理先生，您在访问我国的期间，还会亲自体会到中国人民对缅甸人民的友情。
    缅甸和中国不仅同样经历过外来殖民主义的侵略和压迫，并且由于这种侵略和压迫，我们两国还同样处于经济落后的情况。因此，为了建设自己的国家，摆脱落后和贫困，我们两国人民都同样地在继续为反对外来干涉、争取和平的国际环境而奋斗。这就使我们两国人民的友好合作具备了基础。中华人民共和国从成立的一天起，在国际事务中的坚定不移的方针，就是为世界和平和人类进步的崇高目的而努力。中国在日内瓦会议上为争取恢复印度支那和平的努力，得到了缅甸的支持，缅甸在科伦坡会议上为促进印度支那停战而起的推动作用，也使中国人民得到很深的印象。今年六月，中缅两国总理更发表了联合声明，确认和平共处的五项原则是指导中缅两国关系的基本原则。我们两国在相互关系中正在贯彻这些原则，中缅两国政府代表今年四月在仰光和十一月在北京先后签订的中缅贸易协定和换货议定书就是一个例证。我们两国之间的平等互利的而不是不平等和互相损害的关系强有力地向全世界证明：不同社会制度和不同思想体系的国家，不仅应该而且完全可以和平共处，任何国家都不例外。
    但是有些国家不愿意看到亚洲国家之间的团结和合作，而不断地企图在亚洲国家之间制造分裂和敌视。大家都知道，是谁在唆使蒋介石集团威胁我们两国的安全，破坏亚洲的和平。大家也知道，是谁不欢迎印度支那和平的恢复，不欢迎中国、缅甸和印度以和平共处的五项原则来建立和扩大和平地区的努力。我们都看到，在欧洲使用的组织敌对军事集团、制造分裂、干涉内政的手法同样地应用到亚洲来。最直接危害亚洲各国人民利益的一个例子，就是所谓“东南亚防务集团”的组成。今年九月十三日吴努总理在眉谬军官年会上发表的演说中说，东南亚公约组织的形成“增加了第三次大战的机会”。这句话是完全正确的。中国人民坚决地反对战争，但是决不会被战争集团的威胁吓倒。中国人民热烈地要求和平，但是决不会拿自己的主权和利益作为代价来向战争集团乞求和平。我们认为，世界上爱好和平的国家和人民只有加强团结，击破一切战争威胁和阴谋，才能确保世界的和平和安全，才能使各国人民有获得繁荣和幸福的条件。我们深信，这不仅是中国人民的愿望，也是缅甸和其他爱好和平的国家和人民的共同愿望。
    尊敬的总理先生，您到中国的访问毫无疑义地会增进我们两国之间的互相了解和友好合作，因此也会有利于亚洲和世界的和平。我们愿意同缅甸政府和吴努总理一起，为贯彻和平共处的五项原则，为建立和扩大和平地区，为维护亚洲和世界的和平而共同努力。
    让我们为中缅友好，为亚洲和世界的和平，为缅甸联邦总统巴宇博士的健康干杯！
