Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    Hebei Province Has Purchased Scattered Oil-Bearing Crops
    A letter from the Commercial Department of Hebei Provincial People's Government: The criticism made by Comrade Zhang Bingqian in the "Current Issues" column of the People's Daily on November 21 regarding the phenomenon of no one purchasing scattered oil-bearing crops in our province is completely correct. This year, the output of sunflower seeds in our province has increased unprecedentedly, but we did not promptly notify the commercial departments in various regions to pay attention to doing a good job in purchasing scattered oil-bearing crops. Even when sunflower seeds were already on the market and the masses were urgently requesting the government to purchase them, we still did not pay attention. Therefore, the phenomenon of wasting oil-bearing crops occurred in some areas. The reason for this error is: we mistakenly believed that oil-bearing crops in various regions had already been subject to unified purchase or had signed unified purchase contracts with cooperatives, thus neglecting to stipulate methods for purchasing scattered oil-bearing crops. In order to correct this phenomenon, we have already notified the oil companies in various regions on November 24 to vigorously carry out purchases or entrust cooperatives to purchase all scattered oil-bearing crops planted by farmers, as well as institutions, organizations, troops, schools, etc., in accordance with the principle of "collecting as much as possible, collecting a little if that's all there is, collecting both good and inferior, and pricing according to quality," except for retaining a certain amount of seeds, to ensure the completion of the state plan.
    
    Self-Criticism from Tangshan Rolling Stock Repair Plant
    A letter from Tangshan Rolling Stock Repair Plant: We sincerely accept the People's Daily's criticism on November 14 that our plant delayed the rationalization proposal of young worker Tang Guohua for two years, and we have conducted a self-examination ideologically. The reason for this situation is mainly that we have conservative and complacent ideas, our view of relying on the collective wisdom of the workers to improve production is not clear, and our understanding of the great significance of rationalization proposals is insufficient. Therefore, we have adopted a cold and bureaucratic attitude towards workers' suggestions. In the future, we are determined to strengthen the leadership of rationalization proposal work. We must attach importance to all suggestions from workers, whether large or small, as long as they are beneficial to production; improve various systems for handling rationalization proposals, organize workshop leaders to strengthen learning, and improve their political ideology and professional level; the plant's administrative leaders must overcome procrastination and actively take the initiative to go deep into the workshops to help solve problems, and promote the early realization of all effective rationalization proposals. At the same time, in order to more widely absorb mass opinions, we have established suggestion boxes to collect mass feedback and improve our work in response to existing shortcomings.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    河北省已收购零星油料
    河北省人民政府商业厅来信：十一月二十一日人民日报“当前问题”栏中张秉谦同志对我省零星油料无人收购现象提出的批评，是完全正确的。今年，我省葵花籽产量空前提高，但是我们却没有及时通知各地商业部门注意做好零星油料作物的收购工作。甚至在葵花籽已经上市，群众迫切要求政府收购时，我们仍没有引起重视。因此，在部分地区造成浪费油料作物的现象。产生这个错误的原因是：我们错误地认为各地油料作物已被统购或已同合作社签订统购合同，因而忽视了规定零星油料作物的收购办法。为了纠正这种现象，我们已在十一月二十四日通知各地油脂公司对农民以及机关、团体、部队、学校等单位种植的零星油料作物除留一定数量的种籽外，一律按照“有多收多，有少收少，好次兼收，以质论价”的原则，大力开展收购或委托合作社收购，保证完成国家计划。
    唐山机车车辆修理厂的检讨
    唐山机车车辆修理厂来信：人民日报十一月十四日批评我厂把青年工人汤国华的一件合理化建议拖延了两年，我们除了诚恳接受外，并从思想上进行了检讨。产生这种情况的原因，主要是我们存在着保守自满思想，对依靠工人群众的集体智慧来搞好生产的观点不明确，对合理化建议的重大意义认识不足，因而对工人的建议采取了冷漠的官僚主义的态度。今后决心加强对合理化建议工作的领导，对工人所提的大小建议只要于生产有益的都要从思想上重视起来；健全处理合理化建议的各种制度，组织车间领导加强学习，提高政治思想和业务水平；厂的行政领导上要克服拖拉作风，积极主动深入车间帮助解决问题，促使所有有效的合理化建议早日实现。同时，为了更广泛地吸收群众意见，特建立意见箱收集群众反映，针对存在的缺点改进工作。
