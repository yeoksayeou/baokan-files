A Two-Thousand Kilometer Supply Line
Yang Peng, Deputy Chief of the Supply Section, Second Construction Bureau, Southwest Highway Engineering Bureau
Gao Chunxing, Deputy Chief of Supply Main Station

All the materials needed for the Kangzang Highway are supplied from the interior. On the supply line stretching over two thousand kilometers from Chengdu, winter snows block the mountains, making it impossible to travel by vehicle; summer floods inundate the area, and highways and bridge crossings are often destroyed by floods, making travel difficult; supplies for construction sites must also be transported by yak or human labor. However, these natural obstacles cannot hinder our construction supply work. The various supply and transfer stations set up along this long supply line adopt the methods of segmented transportation, station-by-station transfer, and key reserves to ensure the supply of construction materials.

Before each phase of the project begins, a certain amount of materials, tools, and grain must be transported to the construction site, which requires overcoming difficulties such as high mountains and rapid rivers, sparse population, and insufficient transportation capacity on the Kangzang Plateau. To overcome these difficulties, we organized transportation and transfer stations and receiving stations that move with the construction site. These stations are located in places suitable for the needs of the construction site. Sometimes they are located at the top of mountains at an altitude of four to five thousand meters and minus twenty degrees Celsius; sometimes they are located on riverbanks or cliffs where there is no place to set up tents, using stones and wooden sticks to build foundations and tarpaulins to build temporary warehouses and dwellings. The supply main station at the end of the automobile route and the transfer stations along the way, in order not to delay transportation time, always unload, load, and transport materials as soon as they arrive, regardless of day or night, snow or rain, maintaining the smooth flow of the two-thousand-kilometer supply line.

When newly designed routes have not yet been opened, we must find any barely passable paths to transport construction materials. These paths are often so dangerous that even pedestrians dare not pass. When encountering rivers without bridges and where it is impossible to build bridges, we must set up zip lines or set up rafts and yak-skin boats to slide large quantities of materials across, or build steel cable bridges that only pedestrians can use, and carry the materials across piece by piece. Before the Nujiang Bridge was built in 1953, although the highway reached the riverbank, the materials still had to be transported from Bangda over the mountains, transported to the upper reaches of the Nujiang River, and then transported to the construction site on the west bank of the Nujiang River using zip lines and cable bridges across the two-hundred-meter-wide river.

The main tool for transporting materials to the construction site is the yak; in areas without yak transportation, human labor is organized to carry the materials. The second phase of the project this year is located in the Bomi area on the plateau, where there is the most rainfall and frequent earthquakes, landslides, and quicksand. The construction detachment has more than a dozen teams, who carry grain back and forth every day in the rain on roads destroyed by glaciers and swampy mud. They put the materials in the tents where people live at night, and people sleep under the tarpaulins. In this way, work efficiency is increased by 50% to 70%, ensuring the progress of the front-line construction.

In the first phase of the project in 1954, we also used water transportation, which had never been used on the plateau before. Navigators and PLA soldiers from the interior overcame the difficulties of rapid currents and dangerous shoals, gained experience from countless failed boat trials in a month, modified folding boats and rubber boats, transformed natural river channels, and conquered the Palong Tsangpo (River), ensuring the supply of materials.

In May of this year, the Central Meteorological Observatory continuously reported flood warnings. At this time, the Kangzang Plateau was experiencing continuous rain, indicating that floods were approaching. In early June, there were occasional small landslides on the highway, hindering automobile transportation.

At that time, the road construction troops were working on the Suowaka line. The highway was rapidly extending forward. However, the grain stored west of Zhamu could only last until early August (the plan was to store enough grain for October before the flood season), and most of the grain was still stored in Gangtuo and Qamdo. The road from Qamdo to Zhamu was completed last year and this spring and had never been tested by floods. The arrival of floods would bring us more difficulties.

Sure enough, in mid-June, the floods surged, and the water was fierce. According to local Tibetan compatriots, this was unprecedented in decades. On the route from Qamdo to Zhamu, several sections of the roadbed and bridges were washed away by the floods. At this time, the motorcade full of materials still insisted on transporting westward from Gangtuo and Qamdo section by section. Supply personnel set up three temporary stations on the short and dense route from Wada to Mi. In the situation of many vehicles and few people and urgent tasks, many trade union cadres and surveyors joined this tense battle. On July 13, the key project destroyed by the water was opened. The entire line from Qamdo to Zhamu was open to traffic, and hundreds of cars loaded with materials rushed to Zhamu. At night, the lights of the cars were like fire dragons, illuminating the highway in a string. Looking from afar, the gasoline lamps hanging on the warehouses of each supply transfer station along the way were like lighthouses on the coast. In seven days and seven nights, we completed the various materials necessary for the front-line supply, reaching more than 500 vehicles. Everyone's face was full of pleasant smiles.

Just as the first phase of the third section of the 1954 project was about to be completed, a glacier suddenly burst, and turbid floodwater rolled down from the top of the mountain with boulders as big as tents, submerging three or four kilometers of roadbed, cutting off traffic, and preventing the grain, materials, and tools prepared for the first and second phases of the project from being transported westward, seriously threatening the construction.

However, the glacier did not scare us. We used the characteristics of the glacier's flood peaks and valleys, first repaired a zip line horizontally attached to the glacier, and transported materials day and night. Since the zip line was still far from meeting the needs ahead, we built a cable bridge more than 100 meters long and carried things across the swaying cable bridge.

On the night of June 21, the water was a little lower. The comrades had not slept for two nights and were about to lie down and rest for a while so that they could get up early and rush to transport more than a thousand items that had not been carried ashore. Suddenly, gunshots and gongs sounded, which was a danger signal from the mountain. After a while, the mountain torrents rushed in with boulders and ancient trees, and the water submerged the middle of the bridge surface. The rolling stones hit the steel cable and sparks flew out. It looked like the materials on the shore were about to be washed away. At this time, all the comrades in the station had only one belief: the materials must not be lost. Carrying one more piece would guarantee one more point ahead. So the leaders took the lead, and the accountants, warehouse keepers, and workers all started working together. Even the comrades who dared not cross the bridge during the day helped deliver packages. From one package at a time to two packages and three packages; from one trip in eight minutes to one trip in six minutes and five minutes. In less than three hours, all the materials on the shore were transported.

Soon, the steel cable bridge was finally washed away, and the flood flooded the newly built access road. We built a new cable bridge at the mouth of its canyon, opened a new access road on the mountain, and seized the law of the glacier to build a temporary bridge and continue to rush to transport. The time when the glacier was most harmful lasted for two months. During these two months, we persisted unremittingly and finally rushed all the required materials over. The glacier was tamed in front of us.

The supply personnel knew how difficult it was to transport every nail and every grain of rice to the Kangzang Plateau. In the cold weather, they sewed and sorted the broken and underweight packages one by one. Without a sewing needle, they used bamboo and iron wire instead. Without hemp rope to sew, they used ropes made of yak hair and thread from discarded burlap bags instead. When unloading the car, the workers swept up the rice and soybeans that were scattered on the car and on the ground little by little. They ate bad rice and wore clothes that were worn out by the car, and transported good rice and good clothes to the workers in front. When the rainy season of 1954 came, there were not enough green tarpaulins to cover the materials, so the comrades took out the oilcloths and raincoats they used to lay on and covered them, and also used nails to grind into needles to sew up the old tarpaulins so that the materials were not damaged during the rainy season.

Under the correct leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country and fraternal nationalities, we completed the supply work for the Kangzang Highway. The Kangzang Highway is open to traffic. We and all the road builders and the people of the whole country congratulate the birth of this highway with the same happy mood.

    两千公里的补给线
    西南公路工程局第二施工局供应科副科长　杨朋
    供应总站副站长　高春兴
    康藏公路所需要的一切物资全部是由内地供应的。从成都起长达两千多公里的补给线上，冬季积雪封山，不能行车；夏季洪水泛滥，公路和桥梁渡口常被洪水冲毁，通车困难；施工地段的补给还要用牦牛或人力背运。但这些自然条件的障碍并不能阻挡我们的施工补给工作。分设在这漫长的补给线上的各个供应转运站采用分段运输、逐站转运、重点储备的方法，保证了施工物资的供应。
    每期工程开工前，必须把一定数量的料、具和粮食运达工地，这就要战胜康藏高原上山高水急、人烟稀少、运力不足等困难。为了克服这些困难，我们组织了随工地转移的运输转运站和接收站。这些站址选择在适合工地需要的地方。有时设在海拔四、五千公尺、零下二十度的山顶；有时设在连帐篷都没地方搭的河畔或绝崖上，用石块和木棍垫起地基、用盖布搭起临时库房和住屋。设在汽车终点的供应总站和沿途转运站，为不耽误运输时间，每当汽车运到物资时，总是不分白天黑夜，下雪下雨，随到、随卸、随装，保持着二千多公里补给线的畅通无阻。
    当新设计的路线尚未开辟时，就必须寻找一切勉强可以通行的小路把施工物资运上去，这些小路常常是行人都不敢通过的。遇到没有桥而又不可能架桥的河流，就要架设溜索或设置木筏、牛皮船，将大批物资溜渡过去，或者是架起只能行人的钢丝索桥，把物资一件件的扛过去。一九五三年怒江桥还没有架起以前，公路虽通到江边，但物资仍须由邦达翻越大山，运到怒江上游，用溜索和索桥，渡过二百公尺宽的江面，再翻几个大山，补给到怒江西岸的工地去。
    将物资运到工地的主要工具是牦牛；在没有牦牛运输的地区，就组织人力背运。今年的二期工程，正处于高原上雨量最大，不断发生地震、坍方和流沙最多的波密地区，施工支队有十几个中队，每天冒雨在被冰川冲毁和草泽泥泞的道路上，往返背运粮食。他们晚上把物资放在住人的帐篷里，人睡在盖布底下，就这样还提高工效百分之五十至七十，保证了前方施工。
    在一九五四年的第一期工程里，我们还利用了高原上从来没有的水运。来自内地的水手和解放军指战员们克服了水湍滩险的困难，从一个月的无数次试船失败中取得了经验，改装了折叠舟和橡皮船，改造了自然的河道，战胜了泊龙藏布（江）、保证了物资供应。
    今年五月，中央气象台不断报来洪水的预告，这时的康藏高原阴雨连绵，征象着洪水将至。六月初，公路上已偶有小的坍方，阻碍着汽车运输。
    当时筑路部队正在索瓦卡一线施工。公路迅速向前伸展着。可是扎木以西存粮仅能维持到八月初
  （计划应当在洪水期前储备到十月份的粮食），大部分粮食还存在岗托和昌都。从昌都到扎木，都是去年和今春完成，从未经过洪水考验的新路，洪水一到将带给我们更多的困难。
    果然，六月中旬，洪水暴涨，水势凶猛。据当地藏胞说是数十年所没有。昌都到扎木的路线上，有好几处路基和桥梁被洪水冲毁了。这时满载物资的汽车部队依然坚持着从岗托和昌都向西一段一段的运转。供应人员在瓦达到密密短短的路线上，设上三个临时站。在车多人少、任务紧急的情况下，许多工会干部、测量人员都投入了这个紧张的战斗。七月十三日，被水冲毁的重点工程打通了。昌都到扎木全线通了车，数百辆汽车满载着物资奔向扎木。夜里，汽车的电光像火龙一样，一串一串照在公路上。远看沿途各个供应转运站仓库上所挂的汽油灯，就像海岸上的灯塔。七天七夜，我们完成了前方必需补给的各种物资达五百余车。每一个人的脸上都流露着愉快的笑容。
    正当一九五四年第一期第三段工程即将完工时，突然冰川暴发，浑浊的洪水卷着像帐篷大的巨石从山顶顷泄下来，淹没了三、四公里的路基，断绝了交通，把第一期和为第二期工程所准备的粮食料具全阻止在冰川以东，不能西运，严重的威胁着施工。
    但是，冰川并没有把我们吓倒，我们利用冰川山洪时高时低的特点，首先抢修了一条横系在冰川上的溜索，夜以继日地溜渡物资。由于溜渡还远赶不上前面的需要，又架起一道一百多公尺长的索桥，扛着东西从摇摆的索桥上运过去。
    六月二十一日夜里，水小了一些。同志们已经两夜没有睡觉了，刚想躺下休息一会，好一早起来抢运岸上没有扛完的一千多件东西。突然，响起了枪声和鸣锣声，这是山上发出的危险信号。只一会儿，山洪带着巨石古树奔腾袭来，水头淹没了中间的桥面，翻滚的石头碰在钢丝索上冒出点点火花，眼看岸上的物资就要被冲走。这时，全站同志只有
  一个信念，物资不能受损失，多扛过一件，前面就多一分保证。于是领导带头，会计员、保管员、工人一齐动手，就连白天都不敢过桥的同志也帮助递包。由一次一包、到两包、三包；由八分钟一趟，到六分钟、五分钟一趟。不到三小时，岸上物资全部运过去了。
    不久，钢索桥终于被冲坏了，大水淹没了新修的便道。我们又在它的峡谷口上架起了新的索桥，在山上开辟了新的便道，并抓住冰川的规律，修起临时便桥，继续抢运。冰川危害最大的时间，持续达两月之久。在这两个月里，我们始终不懈，终于把所需物资全部抢运过去。冰川，在我们的面前驯服了。
    供应人员深知每一颗钉子每一粒大米，运到康藏高原来是多么不容易，他们在寒冷的天气里把破了的和不够分量的包件一件件的进行缝补和整理。没有包针，就用竹子和铁丝代替，没有麻绳缝补就用牛毛撵成的绳子，用废麻包拆下的麻线来代替。工人们在卸车时把撒在车上和地下的米，黄豆都一点点的扫起来。他们自己吃坏米，穿被车子磨坏的衣服，把好的米、好的衣服运给前面施工的工人。一九五四年雨季到来时，盖物资的绿棚布不够用，同志们就把自己铺的油布穿的雨衣拿出来搭盖，还用钉子磨成针，缝补那些破旧的棚布，使物资在雨季也没有受到损失。
    在党的正确领导下，在全国人民和兄弟民族的支援下，我们完成了康藏公路的供应工作。康藏公路通车了，我们和全体筑路人员和全国人民以同样愉快的心情，祝贺这条公路的诞生。
