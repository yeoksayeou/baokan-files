To Comrade Denisov, Chairman of the Council of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries,

Since its establishment, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has consistently received the kind concern and sincere assistance of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Soviet people. On the occasion of our Second National Congress, we are again honored by your dispatch of a delegation headed by Vice Chairman Vizhilin to attend and congratulate the success of the Congress. All of our delegates express our heartfelt and profound gratitude to you, and through you to our most reliable and dearest friends – the great Soviet people – with the utmost enthusiasm, and extend our highest respects.

Now, not only all progressive humanity, but even our enemies, clearly understand that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is the strongest bulwark of peace in the Far East and the world. This great friendship is based on the fundamental interests of the two peoples, and is therefore eternal and unbreakable. For the past five years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have consistently striven to strengthen and consolidate this great friendship. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has done its utmost in this struggle. At a time when the American aggressor bloc is stepping up its preparations for new wars in every corner of the world, and has brazenly signed a "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to occupy our sacred territory of Taiwan for a long time, and thereby expand its aggressive war, it is of even greater significance to further consolidate and develop Sino-Soviet friendship and strengthen the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The convening of the Second National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association at this time is of great significance. The Congress calls on all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association to make a hundredfold effort to continue to develop and consolidate the friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, to strengthen the study of the Soviet Union, to promote the socialist construction of the motherland, and to defend peace in Asia and the world.

Long live the eternal and great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!

The Second National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
December 29, 1954, in Beijing

    中苏友协代表会致苏联对外文化协会电苏联对外文化协会理事会主席亲爱的杰尼索夫同志：
    中苏友好协会从成立以来，经常地得到苏联对外文化协会和苏联人民亲切的关怀和真诚的帮助。这次我们举行第二次全国代表会，又蒙你们派遣以维兹日林副主席为首的代表团光临参加并祝贺大会的成功。我们全体代表谨以万分的热忱向您、并通过您向我们最可靠最亲爱的朋友——伟大的苏联人民表示衷心的深切的感谢，并致以崇高的敬礼。
    现在不仅全世界进步人类，即使我们的敌人，也已经清楚地知道，中苏两国人民的友谊是远东和世界和平的最坚强的堡垒。这个伟大友谊是以两国人民的根本利益为基础的，因而是永恒的、牢不可破的。五年来，中国人民在中国共产党领导下，一贯地为着加强和巩固这个伟大的友谊而奋斗。中苏友好协会在这个奋斗中尽了它应尽的力量。目前正当美国侵略集团在全世界各个角落加紧准备新的战争，并悍然和蒋介石卖国集团签订“共同防御条约”，企图长期侵占我国的神圣领土台湾，借此扩大侵略战争的时候，进一步巩固和发展中苏友谊，加强以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营的力量，是有更重大的意义了。中苏友好协会第二次全国代表会在这个时候召开，是有它重大的意义的。大会号召中苏友好协会全体会员百倍地努力，为继续发展和巩固中苏两国人民的友好合作，加强学习苏联，以推进祖国的社会主义建设，保卫亚洲和世界的和平而奋斗。
    中苏两国人民永恒的伟大的友谊万岁！
    中苏友好协会第二次全国代表会
    一九五四年十二月二十九日于北京
