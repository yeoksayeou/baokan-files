    West German Government Military Intelligence Chiefs Heinz and Cobb Defect to Democratic Germany
    Cobb Issues Statement Exposing West German Conspiracy to Revive Militarism
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 24th] According to a broadcast on December 22nd by the German Democratic Republic Ministry of Internal Affairs reported by the German News Agency, the former chief of the Intelligence Division of the West German Bonn government military department "Blank Department," Friedrich Heinz, and the former chief of the West Berlin Intelligence Office of the "Blank Department," Jakob Cobb, defected to the Democratic sector of Berlin on December 16th. They requested asylum from the state organs of the German Democratic Republic and handed over some documents concerning the activities of the "Blank Department" spy organization and the Gehlen spy organization. They explained that they were seeking asylum because they no longer agreed with Adenauer's policies and were therefore being persecuted.
    [Xinhua News Agency, December 25th] According to a TASS report from Berlin on December 23rd: The German News Agency reported that Jakob Cobb, the former head of the West Berlin Intelligence Office of the West German "Blank Department" (War Department) who recently defected from West Berlin to the German Democratic Republic seeking asylum, issued a statement exposing various conspiratorial activities of West German militarism in the process of revival.
    Cobb served as the head of the West Berlin Intelligence Office of the "Blank Department" from 1950. The task of this office was to establish a spy network within the German Democratic Republic and collect military and economic intelligence.
    In his statement, Cobb said: Due to his work, he had particularly clear knowledge of the West German government's plans for re-militarization and the practical measures to implement these plans. He therefore understood that the Adenauer government's war preparations were a deadly danger to the German people and would make German reunification impossible.
    Cobb pointed out that the Adenauer government carried out various deceptive conspiracies to convince the public of the need for re-militarization. The "Blank Department" deliberately exaggerated the number of Soviet troops obtained by the West Berlin Intelligence Office. Cobb himself was criticized more than once for reporting the reduction of Soviet troops stationed in Germany based on facts. The Gehlen spy organization and the intelligence agencies of the "Blank Department" deliberately submitted false intelligence about the Soviet armed forces to Western countries, and this false intelligence has been used by Western spokespersons and newspapers to intimidate Western European society.
    Cobb pointed out that it can be concluded from the conversations of the leading personnel of the "Blank Department's" intelligence work that the establishment of twelve divisions is only the basis for further increasing future armed forces in the "Blank Department's" work and plans. The "Blank Department" has already registered the quota of soldiers from the age of sixteen to thirty, and a total of more than three million people can serve in the military.
    Cobb pointed out that West German militarist groups have resumed intelligence work in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Austria, and Yugoslavia. In order to cooperate with the establishment of the West German armed forces, the West German government is preparing to greatly strengthen its intelligence agencies. The West German government will set up large-scale departments to handle intelligence from various countries, one of the largest of which will be responsible for operations in France and North Africa. After the Paris Agreement is approved, preparations will be made to appoint Colonel Wessel as the leader of intelligence activities against France, who will ostensibly be under the command of the North Atlantic Group's General Staff in Paris in order to disguise himself.
    Cobb also pointed out that West German spy organizations also monitor members of the Bonn Bundestag, senior West German officials, and other political activists. Spy organizations have their own agents in all government agencies, government parties, and trade unions.

    西德政府军部情报机构首脑海恩茨和科布投奔民主德国
    科布发表声明揭露西德复活军国主义阴谋
    【新华社二十四日讯】据德意志通讯社二十二日广播的德意志民主共和国内务部的公告，西德波恩政府军部“布兰克部”的情报司前首脑弗里德里克·海恩茨和“布兰克部”西柏林情报处前首脑雅各布·科布在十二月十六日投向柏林民主区。他们要求德意志民主共和国国家机构给予庇护，并交出了一些关于“布兰克部”特务组织和盖伦间谍组织活动情况的文件。他们解释说他们要求给予庇护是因为他们不再赞同阿登纳的政策，并且因此受到了迫害。
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十三日讯：德意志通讯社报道，最近从西柏林投向德意志民主共和国请求给予避难权的前西德“布兰克部”（战争部）西柏林情报处处长雅各布·科布发表了一项声明，揭露正在复活中的西德军国主义的各种阴谋活动。
    科布从一九五○年起就担任“布兰克部”西柏林情报处处长，这个处的任务是在德意志民主共和国境内建立特务网，搜集军事的和经济的谍报。
    科布在声明中说：由于他的工作关系，他对于西德政府重新军国主义化的计划和实现这些计划的实际措施，知道得特别清楚。他因而懂得：阿登纳政府的战争准备对于德国人民说来是一种致命的危险，并且使德国永远不能统一。
    科布指出：阿登纳政府为了使公众相信必须重新军国主义化，进行了种种欺骗阴谋。“布兰克部”故意夸大由西柏林情报处取得的关于苏联部队的人数，科布本人就曾经为了根据事实报告苏联驻德军队减少的情况而不只一次地受到指责。盖伦间谍组织和“布兰克部”的情报机构故意向西方国家提出关于苏联武装部队的假情报，而这些假情报就一直被西方国家的发言人和报纸利用来恐吓西欧社会人士。
    科布指出：从“布兰克部”情报工作领导人员的谈话中可以得出这样的结论：在“布兰克部”的工作和计划中，建立十二个师仅仅是作为进一步增加未来武装力量的基础。“布兰克部”已经登记了从十六岁到三十岁的兵员名额，服兵役的一共可以有三百多万人。
    科布指出，西德军国主义集团在法国、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡、意大利、奥地利和南斯拉夫等国都恢复了情报工作。为了配合西德武装力量的建立，西德政府正在准备大大加强自己的情报机关。西德政府将设立处理各国情报的规模庞大的部门，其中最大的部门之一将是对法国和北非进行工作的。在巴黎协定批准以后，就准备指派威塞尔上校担任对法国进行情报活动的领导人，他在表面上将归在巴黎的北大西洋集团参谋部指挥，以便伪装自己。
    科布还指出，西德的特务组织也对波恩联邦议院的议员、西德的高级官员和其他政治活动家进行监视。特务组织在所有的政府机构、政府党派和工会中都有自己的代理人。
