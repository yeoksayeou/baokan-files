To the Editor:

    We are quarry workers from Zhangzhu area, Yixing County, Jiangsu Province. The limestone we quarry is an indispensable material in construction projects and an important chemical raw material.

    Our operating techniques are very backward, and accidents causing injuries often occur during drilling and blasting. In Zhuling village alone, ten people have died in four years; and twenty-nine others have been seriously injured. Many workers in neighboring villages have also been injured. The trade union and the government of Yixing County and Zhangzhu District have not sent anyone to help resolve these serious casualties. We are willing to increase production, but because safety is not guaranteed, everyone's enthusiasm for production has been greatly affected.

    Fifty-one quarry workers in Zhuling Village, Zhangzhu District, Yixing County, Jiangsu Province

### 重视采石工人的伤亡事故

    重视采石工人的伤亡事故编辑同志：
    我们是江苏宜兴县张渚地区的采石工人。我们开采的石灰石，是建筑工程中必不可少的材料，也是一种重要的化工原料。
    我们的操作技术很落后，在钻孔放炮时经常发生伤人事故。仅仅祝陵一个村子，在四年中间已经死了十个人；还有二十九人负了重伤。邻近村子中负伤的工人也不少。对于这样严重的伤亡事故，宜兴县和张渚区的工会和政府，至今还没有派一个人来帮助解决。我们是愿意提高生产的，但由于安全问题没有保障，大家的生产积极性已受到了很大的影响。
