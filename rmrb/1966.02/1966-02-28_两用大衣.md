　　A Dual-Purpose Overcoat
　　In 1959, Comrade Jiao Yulu was transferred from a metalworking workshop to the production scheduling department as the head of the section. The comrades in the section noticed that Comrade Jiao Yulu always wore a worn-out old black overcoat to work. One day, a comrade jokingly said to him, "Comrade Jiao Yulu, how can you be so frugal? Now that you are the head of the section, how can you still wear this old overcoat? Shouldn't it be sent to a museum?!"
　　Jiao Yulu smiled at the time and replied, "Get a new one? I haven't thought about it yet! This overcoat can still be worn, so let it serve the people for a few more years. Besides, wearing an old overcoat has its advantages. It's more convenient to go down to the workshop and contact the workers. If I wore a new overcoat, the workers would be afraid of getting oil on it and wouldn't dare to approach me!"
　　Although his words were casual, they deeply moved that comrade.
　　Speaking of Comrade Jiao Yulu's black overcoat, it has a bit of history. In 1953, when he was demobilized from the local army, everyone saw him wearing it. He worked at the Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory for nine years. From the workshop to the production department, people saw him wearing it when it was cold. Until he returned to the forefront of agriculture from the factory, people still saw him carrying that black overcoat when they said goodbye to him.
　　People remember very clearly that he wore this black overcoat as clothing when it was cold, and when he was busy with work and slept in the workshop, he would spread half of it and cover himself with the other half as a blanket, so later, everyone called this overcoat a "dual-purpose overcoat."

　　两用大衣
    一九五九年，焦裕禄同志从一金工车间调到生产调度科当科长。科里的同志见焦裕禄同志上班时，老穿着一件又破又旧的黑大衣。一天，有位同志和他半开玩笑地说：“焦裕禄同志，你怎么这么俭省，现在都当了科长啦，怎么还穿着这件旧大衣，该把它送到博物馆了吧？！”
    焦裕禄当时笑了笑，回答说：“换新的？我还没想过哩！这件大衣还能穿，就让它多为人民服几年务吧。再说，穿旧大衣还有个好处，下车间和工人接触多方便，要是穿件新大衣，工人还怕给咱身上蹭上油，不敢接近呢！”
    他的话虽然只是随口说说，但却使那位同志感受很深。
    要说焦裕禄同志这件黑大衣，还是有点来历的。一九五三年从地方转业时，大家都见他穿着它，在洛阳矿山机器厂工作了九年，他从车间到生产科，天冷时，人们见他穿着它。直到他从工厂又重返农业第一线，送别他的时候，人们仍见他带着那件黑大衣。
    人们记得很清楚，这件黑大衣，天冷时他当衣服穿，遇到工作忙，在车间睡觉时，他就铺一半盖一半当被子用，所以后来，大家都称这件大衣是“两用大衣”。
