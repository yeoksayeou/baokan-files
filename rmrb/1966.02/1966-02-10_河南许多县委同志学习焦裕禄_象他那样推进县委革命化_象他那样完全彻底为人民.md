    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, February 9th. Many county committee leaders from Henan Province, who were in Zhengzhou attending a meeting, shed tears as they read the lengthy article "The Example of a County Party Secretary - Jiao Yulu" and the *People's Daily* editorial "Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, a Good Student of Comrade Mao Zedong," and then held a discussion. They unanimously stated that they were determined to learn Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of completely and thoroughly serving the people, and to promote ideological revolutionization and leadership revolutionization.

    They believe that to make revolution, one must have the revolutionary heroic spirit of Jiao Yulu, fearing neither heaven nor earth. Comrade Meng Zhaoying, Deputy Secretary of the Qixian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said: "Our Qixian County and Lankao County are brother counties with 'houses sharing shoulders' and lands connected, both being old disaster areas. Precisely because we had a fear of difficulty in the face of difficulties, we relied on state-supplied grain for a long time. In the struggle to eliminate the 'three pests', Comrade Jiao Yulu promoted the fearless revolutionary spirit and pioneered a path of self-reliance, greatly encouraging the people of Qixian to actively fight against natural disasters. Comrade Zhang Guoliang, another Deputy Secretary of the County Committee and County Head, and I recently expressed our determination at a county-wide cadre meeting: we will not rest in peace until we change the face of Qixian."

    Comrade Zhao Weixi, Deputy Secretary of the Yanjin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said in connection with his own thinking: "Like Jiao Yulu, I also transferred from the industrial front to agriculture. Arriving in Yanjin, an old disaster county, I felt there were many difficulties and was afraid of them in my mind. I have been working in Yanjin for more than a year, but I have not yet fully understood the ins and outs of the natural disasters in Yanjin County. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I am far behind."

    Li Zhixian, a member of the Fengqiu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, continued: "I am from Fengqiu County. I used to feel that there was no hope in Fengqiu, this disaster area, and I asked the organization to transfer me to work in other areas. This is fundamentally incomparable to Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit. I have made such a determination: I will not leave until the face of Fengqiu is changed; even if the organization transfers me away, I will ask the leadership to let me stay."

    Xu Baizhi, Deputy Secretary of the Luoshan County Committee from southern Henan, said: "The poor must have great revolutionary aspirations, and the rich must also have the spirit of continuous revolution. Luoshan is a land of fish and rice, with very good natural conditions, and production has developed relatively quickly. As a result, the county committee leadership and grassroots cadres developed a sense of pride and complacency. When compared with neighboring counties, they did not look south to the advanced areas of other provinces, but looked north to some old disaster counties in our province. And when they looked, they only saw that they ate more state-supplied grain, while they themselves handed over commodity grain every year and made great contributions to the country. They just didn't see their revolutionary spirit. We must learn Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, make full use of Luoshan County's favorable conditions, consolidate our position, and advance victoriously."

    Wu Wang, Deputy Secretary of the Anyang County Committee in northern Henan, said: "Anyang County is an old cotton area, but why is the average yield of ginned cotton per mu always stuck at fifty or sixty jin? The main reason is that the leadership level of the county committee is not high. Comrade Jiao Yulu is our model in this regard. We must muster our revolutionary enthusiasm, conduct serious, arduous, and meticulous investigations and research, summarize the experience of the masses, plant red flags, and establish pacesetters, and strive to bring the county's grain and cotton production to a new level."

    Wang Fuwang, Deputy Secretary of the Yuxian County Committee in the mountainous area of western Henan, said: "To make revolution, the leadership team must first be revolutionized. We must, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works with a revolutionary spirit, connect with our thinking, examine our work, and further promote the revolutionization of the county committee."

### 河南许多县委同志学习焦裕禄  象他那样推进县委革命化  象他那样完全彻底为人民

    河南许多县委同志学习焦裕禄
    象他那样推进县委革命化
    象他那样完全彻底为人民
    新华社郑州九日电　在郑州参加会议的河南省许多县委负责人，含着眼泪读完了长篇通讯《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》和《人民日报》社论《向毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志学习》以后，进行了座谈。他们一致表示，要决心把焦裕禄同志完全地彻底地为人民服务的精神学到手，促进思想革命化和领导革命化。
    他们认为，要革命，就要有焦裕禄同志的那种天不怕、地不怕的革命英雄气概。中共杞县县委副书记孟昭英同志说：“我们杞县和兰考县是‘房子搭肩’、土地连边的兄弟县，都是老灾区。正因为在困难面前有畏难情绪，长期靠吃国家统销粮过日子。焦裕禄同志在除‘三害’斗争中，发扬了大无畏的革命精神，闯出了自力更生的道路，给杞县人民很大的鼓舞，积极起来同自然灾害作斗争。我和另一位县委副书记兼县长张国梁同志，最近在全县干部会议上都表示了决心：改变不了杞县的面貌，死不瞑目。”
    中共延津县委副书记赵尉喜联系自己的思想说：“我是和焦裕禄一样，也是从工业战线上转到农业方面来的。到了延津这个老灾县，感到困难多，思想上有畏难情绪。到延津工作一年多的时间，我还没有把延津县的自然灾害的来龙去脉摸透。这和焦裕禄同志比起来，差得很远。”
    中共封丘县委委员李治显接着说：“我是封丘县人，以前觉得在封丘这个灾区无出头之日，曾经要求组织上调到其它地区工作，这和焦裕禄同志的革命精神根本不能比。我下了这样的决心：封丘面貌不改变，决不离开；就是组织上调我走，也向领导上要求留下来。”
    来自豫南的罗山县委副书记徐柏之说：“穷要有革命的大志，富也要有不断革命的精神。罗山是个鱼米之乡，自然条件很好，生产发展得比较快。于是，县委领导和基层干部便产生了骄傲自满情绪。与邻县相比时，不是向南看外省的先进地区，而是向北看本省的一些老灾县，而且在看的时候，光看到它们吃国家的统销粮多，而自己却年年交商品粮，对国家的贡献大，就是没有看它们的革命精神。我们一定要把焦裕禄同志全心全意为人民服务的革命精神学到手，充分利用罗山县的有利条件，巩固阵地，乘胜前进。”
    豫北安阳县委副书记武旺说：“安阳县是个老棉区，但是，平均每亩皮棉产量为什么老是五六十斤上不去？主要原因是县委的领导水平不高。焦裕禄同志在这方面是我们的典范。我们一定要鼓起革命干劲，认真进行艰苦细致的调查研究，总结群众的经验，插红旗，树标兵，力争全县粮、棉产量更上一层楼。”
    豫西山区禹县县委副书记王富旺说：“闹革命，首先要领导班子革命化。我们要象焦裕禄同志那样，用革命的精神活学活用毛主席著作，联系思想，检查工作，进一步促进县委革命化。”
