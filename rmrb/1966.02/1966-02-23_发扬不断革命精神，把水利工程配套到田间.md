　　Promote the Spirit of Continuous Revolution and Coordinate Water Conservancy Projects to the Fields
    The main purpose of farmland water conservancy construction is to realize the continuous increase in agricultural production. From the perspective of a single locality, it is important to construct key water conservancy projects. However, the benefits cannot be fully realized with only key projects and without supporting facilities. If water conservancy is to truly serve the purpose of stable and high agricultural yields, it must be fully coordinated, especially the coordination of field projects.
    Agricultural production is constantly developing, and therefore the requirements for water conservancy will not remain at a single level. When drought is the primary contradiction affecting agricultural production, the prominent task is to solve the problem of "water shortage." With the development of agricultural production, new issues will arise, requiring water conservancy facilities and irrigation and drainage technologies to adapt to the developed agricultural production conditions and technical levels. Furthermore, the further improvement of water conservancy facilities and irrigation and drainage technologies will promote even greater increases in agricultural production.
    The Lantian Brigade in the Baitaqu Irrigation Area of Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, a national model of the Dazhai type, used to be very short of water. People said: "The rice on Lantian Slope, a mu of paddy barely fills a basket." In 1952, when the water from the Baitaqu Canal flowed here, the yield of rice per mu jumped to more than 430 jin. However, until 1963, the yield still had not "met the target," meaning it was stable but not high. The main reason was that, although self-flowing irrigation had been achieved long ago, the field projects were not coordinated, and the problem of sequential irrigation and flooding had not been solved. This prevented timely irrigation and drainage, resulting in year-round water accumulation in the fields, deteriorating soil quality, poor growth of red clover (green manure), and increasingly barren field bottoms, with fertilizer being washed away from the hills. They summarized these experiences and lessons and systematically leveled the land and improved the canal system year by year, eliminating "over-watered hills" and implementing rational water use. At the same time, they combined this with agricultural measures to improve farming systems and enhance the quality of agricultural work. In 1963, the grain yield per mu reached 810 jin, and in 1964, it further increased to more than 1,000 jin per mu.
    The situation is similar in the dry-farming irrigated areas of the north. The Xiangyang Brigade of the Xiangyang Commune in the Fenhe No. 1 Dam Irrigation Area in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, could only use flood irrigation due to uneven land and unsound field projects. As a result, agricultural yields remained at a level of 200 to 300 jin per mu for a long time. Since 1964, they have vigorously leveled land and built field projects, initially realizing garden-style farming. In 1965, the grain yield per mu reached 600 jin, an increase of 56 percent compared to 1964, reaching the production target set by the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.
    These examples clearly illustrate that water conservancy work must be continuously revolutionized and constantly advance. Water conservancy facilities, whether in the south or the north, whether in newly built irrigation areas or old irrigation areas, must be continuously improved and upgraded, especially the field projects must be fully coordinated and the land leveled in order to meet the needs of building stable and high-yield farmland. Otherwise, if one is merely satisfied with solving the water source problem, satisfied with having key projects, satisfied with being able to ensure harvests, it will be impossible to achieve high yields on the basis of stable yields.
    Many of the existing water conservancy facilities in our country have not yet fully realized their benefits, mainly because the project coordination work has not kept up, especially the lack of sound field projects. The phenomena of land not being level, sequential irrigation and drainage, and flood irrigation are quite common. Therefore, some water conservancy projects have been completed for many years but have not yet achieved their designed benefits. Some places have achieved water conservancy for several years, but yields have not greatly increased. This shows that without solving the problem of project coordination and without carrying out water conservancy work to the fields, it is just empty talk to fully realize the benefits of water conservancy facilities and tap into the potential for increased production. Moreover, the result of flood irrigation and long-term sequential irrigation and drainage will lead to soil deterioration and cause adverse consequences for agricultural production. The "full coordination" of water conservancy projects has two meanings. On the one hand, it means that all water conservancy facilities must be fully coordinated to give full effect. On the other hand, according to the requirements of building stable and high-yield farmland, from the water source to the field, from irrigation to drainage, from main and branch canals to agricultural and capillary canals, irrigation ditches, from channels to buildings, from point and line projects to land leveling, from water conservancy projects to planting trees and afforestation along canals, all water conservancy facilities must be fully coordinated to better serve agricultural production.
    People generally agree on the coordination of key projects. There are different views on the need to coordinate work to the fields. Some people believe that water conservancy is only responsible for "ensuring production," and that increasing production is the responsibility of other agricultural measures. Water conservancy is about engineering, the backbone is already there, and the masses will coordinate the field projects themselves. Flood irrigation and sequential irrigation and drainage have been going on for many years, and production continues without change. Project coordination and land leveling are good, but they are too labor-intensive, and so on. All these views reflect a common problem: that the idea of water conservancy serving agricultural production is not clear or strong enough; that people are satisfied with what they have achieved, following old ways and lacking the spirit of continuous revolution; that they regard fields with existing water conservancy facilities as "worry-free and guaranteed," without considering the requirements for further increases in production; that their thinking is still confined to the framework of small-scale production, failing to see that the establishment of the socialist system and the people's communes has opened up broad prospects for maximizing the development of agricultural production; that they are insensitive to the new developments and new creations of the masses in production, and have not promptly summarized, improved, and promoted them. These ideas hinder the continuous progress of water conservancy and must be thoroughly overcome.
    Our country's agricultural production has entered a new period of development, and the new situation requires us to build more and faster drought and flood-resistant, stable and high-yield farmland. The task of water conservancy construction, in addition to building new projects according to the principle of need and possibility, the most important thing at present is to vigorously grasp the coordination of existing projects, especially the coordination of field projects, so that these projects can give full effect. At the same time, we must actively improve and upgrade the old water conservancy facilities, tap their potential, and make them better serve the purpose of increasing agricultural production and income. For new construction projects, we must also organize and help the masses to make plans to coordinate the field projects. In this way, we can give full effect in a timely manner. No matter whether they are newly built or existing water conservancy projects, we must fully coordinate them and make them give full effect. This is one of the effective measures to build drought and flood-resistant, stable and high-yield farmland in a way that is more, faster, better and more economical. Engaging in coordination and giving full play to the benefits of water conservancy is the urgent requirement of the peasant masses. As long as we give prominence to politics, deepen and thoroughly carry out ideological work, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and consciousness of the masses to farm for the revolution and run water conservancy for the revolution, and conscientiously implement the Party and the state's various policies on water conservancy, ensuring reasonable burdens, this work can be developed extensively and deeply.
    The coordination of water conservancy projects is both a mass work and a technical work. The key to doing this work well lies in strengthening leadership, unifying planning, carefully arranging, and effectively grasping. Thinking that these are all small projects and therefore relaxing leadership will result in either not being able to do it, or causing waste and losses, which will dampen the production enthusiasm of the masses. As long as we grasp it tightly and do it well, it will not take much effort, but the effect will be very significant, which is very conducive to us striving for a greater and better agricultural harvest this year.

### 发扬不断革命精神，把水利工程配套到田间

　　发扬不断革命精神，把水利工程配套到田间
    兴修农田水利的主要目的，是为了实现农业的不断增产。从一个地方来说，把骨干水利工程修好是重要的，但是，仅有骨干工程，而无配套工程，还是不能充分发挥它的效益。水利要真正为农业的稳产高产服务，就一定要配套齐全，特别是把田间工程配套齐全。
    农业生产是不断发展的，因而对水利的要求，也不会停留在一个水平上。当着干旱是影响农业生产的主要矛盾的时候，突出的任务是解决“缺水”的问题。随着农业生产的发展，又会提出新的课题，要求水利设施、排灌技术与发展了的农业生产条件和技术水平相适应；而水利设施和排灌技术的进一步提高，又会促进农业的更大增产。
    全国大寨式典型江西省余江县白塔灌区有一个兰田大队，原来非常缺水，人们说：“兰田坂的禾，亩田割谷不满箩”。一九五二年，白塔渠的水流到这里，每亩稻谷产量跃增到四百三十多斤；但是直到一九六三年以前，产量还是没有“上纲”，也就是稳而不高。主要原因是，虽然早已实现了灌溉自流化，但田间工程不配套，没有解决串灌漫灌的问题，不能及时排灌，田里长年积水，土质变坏，红花草（绿肥）长不好，田底子越冲越瘦，肥料逐丘流失。他们总结了这方面的经验教训，逐年有计划地平整土地，整治渠系，消灭“过水丘”，实行合理用水，同时结合农业措施，改进耕作制度，提高农活质量。一九六三年，亩产粮食达到了八百一十斤，一九六四年更增加到亩产千斤以上。
    北方旱作灌区也是同样情况。山西省太原市汾河一坝灌区的向阳公社向阳大队，由于土地不平整，田间工程不健全，只能大水漫灌，农业产量长期停留在亩产二、三百斤的水平。一九六四年以来，大搞平整土地，修建田间工程，初步实现了园田化，一九六五年亩产粮食达到六百斤，比一九六四年增产百分之五十六，提前达到了全国农业发展纲要规定的产量指标。
    这些例子清楚说明，水利工作必须不断革命，不断前进。水利设施，不论是南方的或北方的，不论是新建灌区或老灌区，都必须不断进行改善、提高，特别是田间工程要配套齐全，土地要平整，才能适应建设稳产高产农田的需要。否则，如果仅仅满足于解决了水源问题，满足于有了骨干工程，满足于已经能够保收，要在稳产的基础上达到高产是不可能的。
    我国现有水利设施，很多还没有充分发挥效益，主要是工程配套工作没有跟上，尤其是缺乏健全的田间工程，土地不平整，串灌串排、大水漫灌等现象相当普遍。因此，有些水利工程已经建成好多年了，还没有达到设计效益。有些地方已经实现水利化好几年了，而产量还是没有大提高。这就说明，不解决工程配套问题，不把水利工作做到田间，要想充分发挥水利设施的效益，挖出增产潜力，就是一句空话。而且大水漫灌、长期串灌串排的结果，还会引起土壤恶化，给农业生产造成不良的后果。水利工程的“全面配套”，有两方面的含义。一方面是说，所有的水利设施，都要做到配套齐全，充分发挥实效。另一方面是说，根据建设稳产高产农田的要求，从水源到田间，从灌到排，从干支渠到农毛渠、灌水沟，从渠道到建筑物，从点、线工程到平整土地，从水利工程到渠道植树造林，所有水利设施，都要配套齐全，更好地为农业增产服务。
    对于骨干工程的配套，人们的认识是一致的。对于配套工作要做到田间，就有不同的看法。有人认为修水利只是管“保产”，增产是其它农业措施的事；搞水利就是搞工程，骨干已经有了，田间工程群众自己会配套；大水漫灌，串灌串排已经多少年了，不改也照样生产；工程配套、土地平整好是好，就是太费工，等等。所有这些看法，集中反映了一个问题，就是对水利为农业增产服务的思想不明确、不强烈；就是满足于已得成就，因循守旧，缺乏不断革命精神；就是把已有水利设施的田地，看成“放心田，保险地”，没有考虑进一步增产的要求；就是思想还局限在小生产的框框内，看不到社会主义制度和人民公社的建立，为最大限度地发展农业生产开辟了广阔前途；就是对群众在生产中的新发展、新创造，感觉迟钝，也没有及时加以总结、提高和推广。这些思想阻碍着水利事业的不断前进，必须彻底加以克服。
    我国农业生产已经进入新的发展时期，新形势要求我们更快更多地建设旱涝保收稳产高产农田。水利建设的任务，除了要根据需要与可能的原则，修建新的工程以外，目前最重要的，就是大抓现有工程的配套，特别是田间工程的配套，使这些工程充分发挥效益。同时对旧有的水利设施积极进行改善、提高，挖掘潜力，使之更好地为农业的增产增收服务。对于新建工程，也要组织并帮助群众进行规划，把田间工程配套齐全。这样，才能及时发挥实效。不论是新建的或原有的水利工程，都把它们配套齐全，使之充分发挥效益，这是多快好省地建设旱涝保收稳产高产农田的有效措施之一。搞配套，多发挥水利效益，是农民群众的迫切要求，我们只要突出政治，把思想工作作深作透，充分调动群众为革命种田、为革命办水利的积极性和自觉性，认真地执行党和国家有关水利的各项政策，作到负担合理，这项工作就能够广泛深入地发展起来。
    水利工程的配套，既是群众性的工作，也是技术性的工作。要把这项工作做好，关键在于加强领导，统一规划，认真安排，切实抓紧。以为这都是些小工程，因而放松领导，其结果或者是搞不起来，或者是搞起来了，却造成浪费损失，都会挫伤群众的生产积极性。而只要抓紧了，抓好了，费力不多，效果却很显著，十分有利于我们争取今年农业更大更好的收成。
