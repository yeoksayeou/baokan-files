    Heroes Fight on Isolated Island
    On a sea island with no soil, no fresh water, no residents, and nothing but rocks, our People's Liberation Army soldiers have stood proudly for a full ten years. To meet the enemy's attacks and cope with arduous battles, see what earth-shattering heroic deeds these soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have created.
    In the vast Yellow Sea, there is a small island rising from the deep sea. The island has neither soil, nor fresh water, and has never had residents!
    On such a desolate island, the comrades of the Navy's 208th Observation and Communication Station and the Air Force comrades of the "Red Sentinel Radar Station" have guarded it day after day for ten years, making it a pair of sharp eyes for the people of the motherland to monitor the enemy.
    Cannot be blown down by strong winds, cannot be washed away by large waves
    Strong winds and big waves are uninvited guests to this small island. When the wind and waves come, it is simply impossible to tell where the sea is and where the sky is. Dangerous winds and waves bring serious difficulties to the observation and communication station. All their daily necessities have to be transported from the mainland. However, once strong winds arise, ships often cannot come for many days. Sometimes, even if transport ships brave the wind and waves to come, they cannot berth no matter how they turn, and have to return with the materials intact. Once, the island ran out of water, and the higher authorities sent warships to deliver water, braving Force 7 winds. The warships pumped out thirty tons of water from the water tanks, but the island only received one ton of water, the rest being swallowed by the strong winds and waves. If ships cannot come for a long time, everyone goes without fresh water, washing their faces, or eating vegetables for ten days or half a month. If there are no vegetables to eat, they have a plate of soybeans and a handful of salt; when they are extremely thirsty, they scoop up a cup of seawater to rinse their mouths. If there is no fresh water to cook rice, they use seawater, and the cooked rice is bitter, astringent, and difficult to swallow, so cadres and party members take the lead in eating it. They say: "Bitter in the mouth, sweet in the heart." Sometimes, the leadership takes out some of the only remaining fresh water and divides it into half a bowl for each person, and they all yield to each other, cadres yield to soldiers, party members yield to the masses, veterans yield to new recruits, and new recruits yield to the sick, yielding back and forth, no one even wets their lips, and they all hold it and pour it into the oil engine water tank. Although people's throats are often dry as fire and their lips are cracked, the machines have not stopped running for a minute.
    Cannot be blown down by strong winds, cannot be washed away by large waves, cannot be made thirsty without water to drink, cannot be starved without food to eat, cannot be trapped by ships not coming for a long time. For ten years, the comrades of the observation and communication station have stood firm on the small island in this way. Before the Spring Festival of 1963, the ship delivering New Year's goods could not come because the wind and waves were too big. On New Year's Eve, the soldiers gathered around the radio to listen to the news of the people of the whole country celebrating the Spring Festival. After listening, the instructor organized everyone to hold a meeting to compare the memories of the old and new Spring Festivals. The soldiers talked about the past when celebrating the New Year was like passing a difficult test, and talked about the happy scenes of celebrating the New Year after liberation. Through this meeting, the soldiers understood even more that their endurance of hardship here was precisely for the happiness of the people of the whole country.
    Rocks are not harder than determination
    The small island is usually like this, but in wartime, if supply ships cannot come for a long time, can it be defended for a long time? This is a question that the Party branch of the observation and communication station and all the soldiers on the island often consider. Can it be defended in wartime? The answer is affirmative, yes! Therefore, the appearance of this small island must be completely changed. The Party branch led the soldiers to study Chairman Mao's expositions on self-reliance in depth, and thus a battle to change the face of the small island began.
    Fresh water is the biggest problem to be solved on the small island, but water cannot be drawn on this island, so the soldiers and the Air Force comrades carved mountain caves and built reservoirs with hammers and pickaxes. When the first reservoir was built, the higher authorities gave a lot of manpower and material support; but when the second reservoir was built, they only asked the higher authorities for a technician and a blacksmith. The rock quality of this reservoir is very hard, and a hammer strikes only a white spot. The soldiers said: "Rocks are hard, but not harder than our determination. No matter how great the difficulties, they cannot stop us from moving forward." Instructor Tao Lin personally lit the fire for the blacksmith and pulled the bellows, wielding the sledgehammer. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members were the leaders in building the reservoir. Communist Party member Liu Zhengui kept smashing with the sledgehammer. One hammer, one white spot, ten hammers, one small hole. His hand's web between the thumb and forefinger was cracked, and his right hand was swollen like a purple eggplant. The leaders and comrades asked him to go down, but he shook his head and said: "No! If I can't swing the hammer, I can hold the drill." They worked like this day after day, year after year. Old comrades left, and new comrades came up to continue the work. After more than four years, two large reservoirs were built. From then on, there was no need to cook rice with seawater anymore. The soldiers also built a seaside bathhouse themselves, so they could often take a hot bath.
    Transporting soil from the mainland to cultivate fields on the island
    The problem of drinking water has been solved, and the life of "a plate of soybeans and a handful of salt" must also be completely changed. The soldiers could not eat fresh vegetables on the island, so they grew their own. Growing vegetables on rocks is easier said than done! But now it has become an ironclad fact that thousands of kilograms of vegetables can be harvested every year. How are these vegetables grown? It has to be told from the beginning.
    In the spring of 1957, the old station chief Zuo Enliu brought some flower seeds from the mainland and gave them to signal soldier Li Shuwen, asking him to complete it as a political task—to let these flower seeds germinate, grow, and bloom here. Li Shuwen dug up some dust and rotten grass from the rock crevices, found a sunny and sheltered place to plant them, and after some time, the seedlings actually emerged. At that time, fresh water was more precious than oil, so it could not be used to water them, so he mobilized some comrades not to use soap when washing their faces and use the wash water to water the flowers. In the summer, the flowers grew up. Suddenly, a gust of wind, carrying seawater, rushed onto the small island, and the flowers were drowned by the seawater. Li Shuwen re-arranged the piece of land that had been washed away by the seawater, planted half of it with flowers, and the other half with three Chinese cabbages. In the autumn, the three Chinese cabbages grew lush and green. All the station personnel came to visit them again and again as if they were treasures.
    The growth of the three Chinese cabbages gave the Party branch great inspiration: since these three cabbages can grow, more vegetables can also grow. The Party branch called on everyone to split mountains and chisel rocks to open up land for growing vegetables. Without soil, everyone scraped dust from the rock crevices and ground weathered rocks into powder to use as soil. The amount collected in this way was limited after all, so the Party branch put forward the slogan of "a handful of soil" and "a vegetable"; all personnel who went to the mainland brought back a handful of soil when they returned to the island, and soldiers who returned home from visiting relatives also brought back a handful of soil, and leaders and staff who came to the island also brought back a handful of soil. Some soldiers even wrote letters home, specifically asking their parents to send a package of soil from their hometown. From then on, the soil of the motherland crossed the Yellow River, crossed the Yangtze River, crossed the ocean, and was transported to this small island from all directions, handful by handful, package by package. With soil, the soldiers used all their time to open mountains and chisel rocks, piling them into small terraces. The largest of these small terraces was the size of two or three tables, and the smallest was the size of a tea tray, which could only grow one vegetable. Building such a small piece of land often required moving dozens or hundreds of rocks, and a larger piece of land required moving thousands of rocks. The soldiers filled the land handful by handful and piled the rocks piece by piece. Sometimes, just after they had piled it up, it would be washed away by a gust of wind and waves. If it was washed away, they would pile it up again. They piled it up as many times as it was washed away. The small terraces became more and more year by year. By 1965, the comrades of the 208th Observation and Communication Station had built 153 small terraces. Although each piece of land was very small, each piece of small land condensed the soldiers' iron will to overcome difficulties.
    The small island is undergoing a new look
    There was more and more land, but dangerous winds and waves seemed to be deliberately making things difficult for the soldiers. Sometimes, just as the seedlings emerged from the soil, a gust of wind would roll up seawater and kill them all. When there was little land at the beginning, everyone could still use broken mats and straw bags to cover them before the wind came. Later, when there was more land, they could not cover it all. If it was killed once, they would plant it a second time. Often, they had to plant it five or six times a year before they could harvest. When the vegetables grew a little bigger, the soldiers would tie the leaves with ropes to protect the heart of the vegetable. If the wind and waves damaged the leaves, the heart of the vegetable would continue to grow. In this way, they used their wisdom and perseverance to protect each vegetable. When there was a drought, they were reluctant to use the water sent to water the vegetables, and relying solely on wash water was not enough, so every time it rained, from cadres to soldiers, they all held basins and buckets, receiving the water basin by basin and bucket by bucket, and saving the rainwater they collected for watering the vegetables during droughts. In this way, vegetable production increased year by year. Sometimes, transport ships could not come for ten days or half a month in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, but they still had a constant supply of vegetables, and there were Shandong scallions, Hunan peppers, pumpkins, string beans, tomatoes, chives, celery, etc., everything was available.
    With the problem of water and vegetables basically solved, the soldiers further focused on fresh fish and fresh meat. Several years ago, they got two piglets and raised them; but one of them accidentally fell off a cliff and died. The remaining one was raised by the soldiers in a discarded small cement shelter. After more than a year, it grew to more than 200 kilograms. Everyone was extremely happy to eat the pig they had raised with their own hands, so they all worked together to build walls and pigsties on the hillside, and bought five or six more piglets from the mainland. Just as the piglets were growing vigorously, the big waves caused by the Force 11 typhoon collapsed the pigsty walls, and the piglets were about to be swallowed by the seawater. Cook Yang Zuoli risked danger to rescue the piglets. After the wind stopped, he went to rebuild the pigsty. When the piglets got sick, he took them back to his dormitory, put the sick piglets in a broken wooden box with straw, and fed them food bit by bit, so that the sick piglets turned from danger to safety one by one. From then on, they could eat fresh pork almost every month.
    Revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought have exchanged their hard work for fruitful results. Now this small island is full of green vegetables and pigs. They also often use holidays to organize fishing, catch sea ducks, and dig bird eggs.
    The appearance of the small island is changing day by day. All around the island, there are stone ladder roads built by themselves, and there is also a basketball court built over five years. If the dangerous winds and waves did not conquer these tenacious soldiers when they first came to the small island, now neither natural enemies nor class enemies can do anything to them. The soldiers' roots on the small island are getting deeper and deeper!
    Building the island to defend the island, defending the island for battle
    The soldiers understand that they are not simply building the island for the sake of building the island, but building the island to defend the island, to prepare to cope with even more arduous battles. The Party branch often organizes everyone to study Chairman Mao's expositions on the reactionary nature of imperialism. They have all made such ideological preparations: the enemy may attack right here on my shift.
    The soldiers have been on this small island for ten years, day after day, unmoving in the wind, unshaken by the waves, undefeated by hardship, and tireless. What they feel is not bitterness, but sweetness, joy, and glory. This is the power of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is like a blazing fire, turning this small island into a revolutionary furnace that burns more and more vigorously, and refining the soldiers into "true gold" and "pure steel."
    Although the island where the 208th Observation and Communication Station is stationed is very small, the soldiers' hearts are wider than the sea. What they think about is not themselves, but the great motherland and the two-thirds of the people in the world who have not been liberated.

    英雄战孤岛
    在一个没有泥土、没有淡水、没有居民、除了石头还是石头的海岛上，我们解放军的战士们，傲然屹立了整整十年。为了迎击敌人的进攻，为了应付艰苦的战斗，请看这些用毛泽东思想武装的战士创造出多么惊心动魄的英雄事迹。
    在辽阔的黄海面上，有一个从深海中耸起的小岛。岛上既无泥土，又无淡水，更从来没有居民！
    就在这样一个荒凉的小岛上，海军二○八观通站的同志们和“红色前哨雷达站”的空军战友们一道，十年如一日地坚守着它，使它成了祖国人民监视敌人的一双锐敏的眼睛。
    风大刮不倒　浪大冲不倒
    大风大浪，是这个小岛的不速之客。风浪来时，简直分不清那里是海，那里是天。险风恶浪，给观通站带来严重的困难。他们的一切生活用品都要从大陆运去。但是大风一起，经常很多天来不了船。有时即使运输船冒着风浪赶来了，转来转去也无法靠岸，只得原封不动地载着物资返回。有一次，岛上断水了，上级派军舰冒着七级大风，强来送水。军舰水舱打出了三十吨水，岛上却只接到一吨水，其余的全被大风浪吞掉了。日子久了来不了船，大家就十天半月喝不上淡水，洗不上脸，吃不上蔬菜。没有蔬菜吃，就来一盘黄豆一把盐；实在渴极了，就舀杯海水嗽嗽口。没有淡水煮饭，就用海水煮，煮出的饭又苦又涩难以下咽，干部和党员们就带头吃饭。他们说：“苦在嘴里甜在心里。”有时候，领导上把仅存的一点淡水拿出一些来，每人分半碗，又都是你让我，我让你，干部让战士，党员让群众，老兵让新兵，新兵让病号，让来让去谁也不往嘴皮上沾，一个个端着又倒进了油机水箱。尽管人的嗓子经常干得冒火，嘴唇焦裂，但是机器却一分钟也没停止过运转。
    风大刮不倒，浪大冲不倒，没有水喝渴不倒，没有粮吃饿不倒，长期来不了船困不倒。十年来，观通站的同志就是这样坚强地挺立在小岛上。一九六三年的春节前，因为风浪太大，送年货的船来不了。除夕，战士们就围着收音机收听全国人民欢庆春节的消息。听完之后，指导员又组织大家举行了一次新旧春节回忆对比会。战士们谈到过去过年如过关的情景，谈到解放后过年的幸福情景。通过这次会议，使战士们更加懂得：自己在这里忍受艰苦，正是为了全国人民的幸福。
    石头硬不过决心
    小岛上平时都是这样，到了战时补给船只长期来不了，能不能长期守得住？这是观通站党支部也是全岛战士经常考虑的问题。战时到底能不能守得住，回答是肯定的，能！因此，必须彻底改变这个小岛的面貌。党支部领导着战士深入学习了毛主席有关自力更生的论述，于是一场改变小岛面貌的战斗开始了。
    淡水是小岛上首先要解决的大问题，但这岛上打不出水，战士们便和空军同志们一道，一锤锤一镐镐地掏山洞打水库。在修第一座水库的时候，上级还给了不少人力物力的支援；但修第二座水库的时候，他们却只向上级要了一个技术员和一个铁匠师傅。这座水库的石质很坚硬，一锤打下去，只是一个白点。战士们说：“石头硬，硬不过我们的决心。困难再大，挡不住我们前进。”指导员陶林亲自给铁匠师傅生火，拉风匣，抡大锤。共产党员和共青团员们，是修水库的带头人。共产党员刘振贵，抡起大锤就砸个不停。一锤一个白点，十锤一个小洞。他的手虎口被震裂了，右手肿得象个紫茄子，领导上和同志们让他下去，他把头一晃说：“不！抡锤不行我能掌钎。”他们就这样一天又一天，一年又一年，老同志走了，新同志又上来接着干，前后经过了四年多的时间，两座较大的水库修成了。从此，再也不用海水煮饭了。战士们还自己动手，修建了海岛浴池，可以经常洗上个热水澡。
    从大陆运土　在岛上造田
    吃水问题解决了，那种一盘黄豆一把盐的生活也要来个彻底改观。岛上吃不到新鲜蔬菜，战士们就自己种。在石头上种菜，谈何容易！但是现在每年都能收获数千斤蔬菜，却成了铁的事实。这些菜是怎么种出来的呢？还得从头说起。
    一九五七年春，老站长左恩流，从陆地上带来了一些花种，交给了信号兵李树文，要他当成一项政治任务来完成——让这些花种在这里发芽、成长、开花。李树文到石缝挖了一些尘土和烂草末，找了一块向阳避风的地方种上，过了一些时候，花苗果然出土了。当时淡水比油还宝贵，不能用淡水去浇，他便动员一些同志，洗脸时不用肥皂，把洗脸水用来浇花。到了夏天，花儿长大了。突然一阵大风，卷着海水扑上小岛，花儿被海水淹死了。李树文又把被海水冲垮的那块小地重新整理了一下，用一半种了花，另一半种了三棵白菜。到了秋后，三棵大白菜，都长得绿油油的。全站人员都象看宝贝一样，三番五次地来参观。
    三棵白菜的成长，给了党支部很大启示：既然这三棵菜能长大，更多的菜也可以长起来。党支部便号召大家劈山凿石，开地种菜。没有土，大家便到石缝里刮尘土，把风化石研成碎末当土用。这样收集来的毕竟有限，党支部又提出了“一把土”“一棵菜”的号召；凡是到陆上去的人员回岛，都要带上一把土，探家回来的战士也带上一把土，首长和机关人员上岛也带上一把土。还有的战士写信回家，专门让父母寄来一包家乡土。从此，祖国大陆的泥土就越过黄河，跨过长江，渡过海洋，从四面八方，一把把一包包地运上了这个小岛。有了泥土，战士们利用一切时间，开山凿石，垒成了一块块小梯田。这些小梯田，最大的有两三张桌子大，小的有茶盘那么大，只能种上一棵菜。就垒这样一块小地，往往也要搬动几十块或上百块的石头，大一点的地，就更需要搬动上千块的石头。战士们就这样一把一把地往上填土，一块一块地垒石头。有时刚垒好了，就被一阵风浪冲垮了。冲了，他们就再垒。冲几次就垒几次。小小梯田，一年多似一年。到一九六五年为止，二○八观通站的同志已经垒成了小梯田一百五十三块。尽管每块地都很小，但每块小地，都凝聚着战士们战胜困难的钢铁意志。
    小岛改换新装
    地是越来越多了，但是险风恶浪却仿佛专门和战士们为难。有时菜苗刚出土，一阵大风卷上海水来，全给打死了。开始地少的时候，在风来之前，大家还可以用破席子、草袋去遮盖一下。以后地多了，就盖不过来了。一次给打死了，再种第二次。经常每年要种上五次六次，才能收获。当菜刚长大一些的时候，战士们便用绳子捆住菜叶，包住菜心。风浪打坏了菜叶，菜心还继续长。他们就这样，用智慧和毅力，保卫着一棵棵蔬菜。天旱了，舍不得用送来的水浇，光靠洗脸水也不够用，于是，每到下雨天，从干部到战士都端着脸盆，提着水桶，一盆盆地接，一桶桶地收，把接下来的雨水，留着旱天浇菜用。就这样，使得蔬菜年年增产。春夏秋三季有时运输船十天半月来不了，他们照样蔬菜不断，而且山东大葱、湖南辣椒，南瓜、豆角、西红柿、韭菜、芹菜等等，应有尽有。
    水和蔬菜的问题基本解决了，战士们又进一步在鲜鱼鲜肉上打主意了。几年以前，他们搞来两头小猪，养起来；但有一头不小心掉下悬崖摔死了。剩下的另一头，战士们就把它放进了一个作废的小水泥掩体里养，一年多便长了二百多斤肉。大家吃到了自己亲手喂出的猪，高兴极了，便一齐动手在半山腰垒围墙修猪圈，又到陆地上买了五六头小猪。小猪正长得带劲的时候，十一级台风掀起的大浪把猪圈围墙给冲垮了，小猪眼看就要被海水吞没。炊事员杨佐礼冒着危险，救出小猪。风停之后，他再去重修猪圈。小猪生了病，他就抱回自己的宿舍，把病猪放在垫草的破木箱里，一口一口地喂它吃食，使小病猪一个个转危为安。从此，他们每月几乎都能吃到新鲜的猪肉。
    毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，用自己劳动的双手，换来了丰硕的果实。现在这个小岛已经是青菜满山猪满圈。他们还经常利用假日组织钓鱼、抓海鸭子、挖鸟蛋。
    小岛的面貌正在日新月异地改观。岛的四面八方都有了他们自己造的石梯大路，也有了用五年多的时间修成的篮球场。如果说，在开始上小岛的时候，险风恶浪，没有征服这些顽强的战士，现在无论是自然敌人，还是阶级敌人，更把他们奈何不得。战士们在小岛上的根子越扎越深了！
    建岛为守岛　守岛为战斗
    战士们懂得，他们并不是单纯的为建岛而建岛，而是为守岛而建岛，为了准备应付比这更艰苦的战斗。党支部经常组织大家学习毛主席有关对帝国主义反动本性的论述。他们都作了这样的思想准备：就在我这班岗上，敌人可能就会打来。
    战士们在这座小岛上，十年如一日，风吹不动，浪打不摇，困不垮，累不倒。他们感到的不是苦，而是甜，而是愉快和光荣。这是毛泽东思想的力量。毛泽东思想象熊熊的大火，把这座小岛变成了一座越烧越旺的革命大熔炉，把战士们都炼成了“真金”“纯钢”。
    二○八观通站驻守的岛虽然很小，但战士们的心胸比大海还宽广，他们想到的不是自己，而是伟大的祖国和世界上三分之二没有解放的人民。
