    Questioning "Commentary on the Newly Compiled Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'"
    Fang Shi
    After reading Comrade Yao Wenyuan's "Commentary on the Newly Compiled Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'," I feel that some of Comrade Yao Wenyuan's criticisms are correct, such as the script portraying Hai Rui as extremely lofty, even becoming a "savior" for the people to live a good life, and depicting the people as weak and helpless, only able to beg for mercy from "upright officials," and so on. However, I still have some questions about certain arguments and expressions of Comrade Yao Wenyuan.
        How to View "Upright Officials" in History?
    Comrade Yao Wenyuan believes: "Fundamentally speaking, no matter how 'upright' or how 'good' 'upright officials' and 'good officials' are, they are, after all, only the 'upright officials' and 'good officials' of the landlord class exercising dictatorship over the peasants, and it is impossible to be the opposite." Doesn't this mean that as long as they are historical figures of the feudal landlord class, whether they are "upright officials" or "corrupt officials," they are all the same?!
    If we follow Comrade Yao Wenyuan's logic, then what is the point of studying history and "giving history a certain scientific status"? Because Comrade Yao Wenyuan has already determined the status of the ancients, they are all the same, no different.
    Moreover, Comrade Yao Wenyuan also believes that "upright officials" are a tool used by the landlord class to "paralyze the awareness of the peasants," "cover up the essence of the ruling class," "weaken peasant resistance," and are "an important means of class struggle against the peasants, along with armed suppression." According to this view, "upright officials" are even worse than corrupt officials. Because the cruel oppression of corrupt officials and bureaucrats will more quickly arouse peasant resistance and ignite the flames of peasant uprisings, while the reform measures of "upright officials" alleviate class contradictions, weaken peasant resistance, and prolong the life of the ruling class. But what conclusion will this lead to? Since corrupt officials and bureaucrats are better than "upright officials," then let history be full of greedy and tyrannical corrupt officials and bureaucrats, and the peasants will have to continuously launch uprisings. However, in feudal society, peasant uprisings and struggles cannot overthrow the rule of the feudal landlord class and achieve complete victory, and cannot change the old relations of production. May I ask: If this is the case, how can the production of feudal society develop? How can this period of history of feudal society move forward?
    To erase the class essence of "upright officials," and even to say that "upright officials" are "saviors" representing the interests of the people, is obviously a serious error of principle. However, Comrade Yao Wenyuan's generalization of "upright officials" and "corrupt officials," complete negation, and even saying that upright officials are worse than corrupt officials, is probably also incorrect. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Coalition Government": "The good or bad, big or small, of the effect of the policy and the practice of any Chinese political party upon the Chinese people depends ultimately on whether, and how much, it helps to develop their productive forces and on whether it fetters or liberates these forces." Similarly, shouldn't we also view the "upright officials" in feudal society in this way? At that time, Hai Rui suppressed annexation, cracked down on local tyrants, returned land (let's just follow Comrade Yao Wenyuan's "research" that the land was returned to middle and small landlords and rich peasants), redressed unjust verdicts, and repaired the Wusong River. Did this not benefit the people and production in the Jiangnan area at that time at all? Lenin said in "The Economic Content of Narodism": "Not being satisfied with the 'small efforts' of bourgeois progress does not at all mean completely negating partial reforms. Marxists never deny some (though insignificant) benefits of these measures, that they can make some (though insignificant) improvements in the lives of workers." Why does Comrade Yao Wenyuan "completely negate" these partial reforms of Hai Rui, and the "some (though insignificant) benefits" of some of the measures he implemented, attacking one point and ignoring the rest?
    Should We Learn and Inherit Certain Spirits of the Ancients?
    Comrade Yao Wenyuan criticizes Comrade Wu Han for "confusing" Hai Rui's spirit of "uprightness and integrity" and "fearlessness of the powerful" "with the revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit of the proletariat." In my opinion, this criticism is not factual. Comrade Wu Han did not say this in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." On the contrary, in his article "On Hai Rui," he clearly wrote that Hai Rui's unyielding spirit, consistency in word and deed, uprightness and integrity... and other qualities "are what we need to learn and advocate today, and only in the socialist era can these qualities be fully developed, although the Hai Rui we need today and the Hai Rui of the feudal era have fundamental differences in social content." Why does Comrade Yao Wenyuan turn a blind eye to this point?
    Moreover, Comrade Yao Wenyuan also believes that some excellent qualities of the ancients, such as "uprightness and integrity," "fearlessness of the powerful," "consistency in word and deed," and "courage to admit mistakes," all have "their specific class content" and cannot be "abstracted." The specific meaning is that these "uprightness and integrity, consistency in word and deed..." etc., all belong to the evil feudal landlord class and should all be discarded, and should never be learned (even if it is necessary to first criticize them and give them new meanings). Are the ancients really so useless, with nothing worth learning and inheriting? Chairman Mao said: "Our nation has a history of thousands of years, with its characteristics and many treasures. We are still elementary school students regarding these. Today's China is a development of historical China; we are Marxist historicists, and we should not sever history. From Confucius to Sun Yat-sen, we should summarize and inherit this precious legacy." ("The Status of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War") Moreover, Chairman Mao also asked us to "learn Confucius's 'ask about everything'" in his article "Oppose Book Worship." How should Comrade Yao Wenyuan explain these?
    Was Hai Rui Loved by the People at the Time?
    When Comrade Yao Wenyuan's arguments are insufficient, he resorts to far-fetched interpretations, splitting hairs, and reasoning based on subjective imagination to arrive at the conclusions he needs in order to refute the other party. Here is an example to illustrate. Historical records state that after Hai Rui's death, "the common people closed the market, and when the funeral procession went out on the river, people in white mourning clothes lined the banks to see him off, and those who poured libations and wept were not interrupted for a hundred miles." Comrade Wu Han believes that the broad masses of the people at that time respected and loved Hai Rui based on this. In order to refute this point and prove that Hai Rui did not receive the respect and love of the "truly broad masses of the people," Comrade Yao Wenyuan made the following deduction: "As long as we think about it, before liberation, the broad poor peasants were so poor under the cruel exploitation of the landlord class that they could not even afford clothes, many peasants wore a torn piece of clothing for generations, and they did not even have mourning clothes to wear when their relatives died at home, we know that those who could wear decent 'white mourning clothes' to pay their respects must not have been poor peasants, must not have been the 'broad masses of the people' mentioned by Comrade Wu Han, but could only have been some of the landlords, rich peasants, and merchants." What a "think about it... and we know..."! Qu Yuan is deeply respected and loved by the people of our country. After he committed suicide by throwing himself into the Miluo River, the broad masses of the people commemorate him every year on the fifth day of the fifth month by rowing dragon boats (dragon boat races) and wrapping zongzi. If we follow Comrade Yao Wenyuan's "think about it": before liberation (more specifically, in ancient times), the broad masses of the people had problems even feeding themselves, so where would they have the leisure and interest to row dragon boats, where would they get the rice, and even the best glutinous rice, to throw into the river to feed the fish? Then wouldn't it be "we know" that "those who miss and love Qu Yuan at that time" "are definitely not" "the broad masses of the people" "but can only be some of the landlords, rich peasants, and merchants"? Wouldn't it be possible to conclude from this that Qu Yuan is not loved by the true "broad masses of the people" of our country?!
    Obviously, as long as we "think about it," "we know" that Comrade Yao Wenyuan's argument is unreasonable and untenable!
    How to View the Realistic Significance of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"?
    In the last paragraph of his article, Comrade Yao Wenyuan said that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" asks people to learn "returning land" and "redressing unjust verdicts," and so on. This kind of understanding cannot help but be surprising. Comrade Yao Wenyuan is not a naive and ignorant child who would pick up a stick and fight after watching "The Three Musketeers." Would he really grab the commune leader's collar and demand "returning land" and hug the president of the court and demand "redressing unjust verdicts" after watching "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"?!
    Comrade Yao Wenyuan believes that to analyze a work, it should be linked to the current real life. I completely agree with this point. However, Comrade Yao Wenyuan forcibly links "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to the "single-handed wind" and the "reversal of verdicts wind," and concludes that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is "a reflection of a form of class struggle" in which "the bourgeoisie opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist revolution." This is probably somewhat unreasonable.
    As long as we carefully read "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and think about it, we know that "returning land" and "redressing unjust verdicts" are not the main content that the play wants to express, but are only part of the plot used to highlight Hai Rui. Obviously, it cannot be considered that the playwright wants people to learn "returning land" and "redressing unjust verdicts" to engage in "single-handedness" and make trouble about "reversing verdicts." To take a step back, "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" also contains plots such as Hai Rui organizing the people to repair the Wusong River. Why doesn't Comrade Yao Wenyuan think that this is to encourage people to build water conservancy projects, prevent natural disasters, and overcome difficulties in difficult times?
    I think that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" mainly highlights Hai Rui's spirit of uprightness, integrity, fearlessness of the powerful, and daring to struggle. (The author has made a principled mistake in this regard - elevating Hai Rui, blurring his class essence, and belittling the people's struggle, etc.) Therefore, in difficult times when domestic and foreign class enemies are taking the opportunity to launch frenzied attacks on socialism, why can't this play be understood as aiming to enlighten and educate people to dare to uphold the truth, overcome difficulties, and dare to fight against bad people and bad things, and to fight against class enemies?
    Regarding this point, Comrade Yao Wenyuan is grasping at shadows and making far-fetched interpretations, forcibly turning his subjective assumptions into the playwright's subjective intention, which is probably not the "serious, combative, and scientific attitude" that the proletariat should have.

### 对《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》一文质疑

专栏：

    对《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》一文质疑
    方史
    读了姚文元同志的《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》一文，觉得姚文元同志有些批评是正确的，譬如剧本把海瑞描写得非常高大，甚至成了人民过好日子的“救星”，以及把人民描写得软弱无力，只会乞怜于“清官”等等。但是，对于姚文元同志的某些论点和提法，我还有一些疑问。
        怎样看历史上的“清官”？
    姚文元同志认为：“从根本上说，不论‘清官’、‘好官’多么‘清’，多么‘好’，他们毕竟只能是地主阶级对农民实行专政的‘清官’、‘好官’，而不可能相反。”这岂不是说，只要是历史上封建地主阶级的人物，不论他们是“清官”还是“贪官”，统统都是一号货色吗！？
    如果按照姚文元同志的这种逻辑，那么我们还有什么必要研究历史，“给历史以一定的科学的地位”呢？因为古人的地位，姚文元同志早给确定好了，都是半斤八两，一模一样。
    而且，姚文元同志还认为：“清官”是地主阶级用来“麻痹农民的觉悟”，“掩盖统治阶级本质的工具”，“是削弱农民的反抗”，“当作武装镇压，对农民进行阶级斗争的重要手段”。照此看来，“清官”比起贪官来要更坏了。因为贪官污吏的残酷压迫会更快地引起农民的反抗，燃起农民起义的烈火，而“清官”的改良措施，缓和了阶级矛盾，削弱了农民的反抗，延长了统治阶级的寿命。可是，这会得出什么结论来呢？既然贪官污吏要比“清官”好，那么，且让历史上尽是贪婪暴虐的贪官污吏，而农民只好不停息地举行起义好了。但是在封建社会，农民的起义和斗争又不可能推翻封建地主阶级的统治而取得彻底胜利，不能改变旧的生产关系。请问：照此办理，封建社会的生产如何发展？封建社会的这一段历史又如何向前推进？
    抹杀“清官”的阶级本质，甚至把“清官”说成是代表人民利益的“救星”，显然是严重的原则的错误。但是，姚文元同志对“清官”、“贪官”一概而论，全盘否定，甚至把清官说得比贪官更坏，恐怕也是不正确的吧。毛主席在《论联合政府》一文中指出：“中国一切政党的政策及其实践在中国人民中所表现的作用的好坏、大小，归根到底，看它对于中国人民的生产力的发展是否有帮助及其帮助之大小，看它是束缚生产力的，还是解放生产力的。”同样的，对于封建社会里的“清官”，不也应该这样看吗？海瑞在当时抑制兼并，打击豪强，退田（姑且就按姚文元同志的“考证”，田是退给了中小地主和富农），平冤狱，修治吴淞江，难道对当时江南地区的人民和生产毫无好处吗？列宁在《民粹主义的经济内容》一文中说：“不能满足于资产阶级进步的‘微小的努力’，决不等于完全否定局部的改良。马克思主义者决不否定这些措施的某些（虽然是微不足道的）好处，这就是它们能使劳动者的生活得到某些（虽然是微不足道的）改善”。姚文元同志对于海瑞的这些局部的改良，对于他所实行的一些“措施的某些（虽然是微不足道的）好处”，为什么要攻其一点，不及其余地“完全否定”呢？
    古人某些精神要不要学习和继承？
    姚文元同志批评吴晗同志把海瑞的“刚直不阿”“不畏强暴”的精神“同无产阶级的革命性，战斗性混为一谈”。我看，这个批评不符事实。吴晗同志在《海瑞罢官》中没有这样讲过。相反，他在《论海瑞》一文中却清清楚楚地写道：海瑞的不屈不挠，言行一致，刚直不阿……等品质“都是我们今天所需要学习和提倡的，而且只有社会主义时代，这些品质才能得到充分的发扬，虽然我们今天需要的海瑞和封建时代的海瑞在社会内容上有原则的不同”。这一点，姚文元同志为什么视而不见呢？
    而且，姚文元同志还认为，古人的一些优秀品质，譬如“刚直不阿”，“不畏强暴”，“言行一致”，“敢于承认错误”等等，都有“它们具体的阶级内容”而不能“抽象化”。其具体意思也就是说，这些“刚直不阿，言行一致……”等等，都是隶属于万恶的封建地主阶级的，统统应该摒弃，万万学不得（那怕是首先要进行批判，赋予它们新的含义）。难道古人就这么一无是处，没有一点值得学习和继承的东西吗？毛主席说过：“我们这个民族有数千年的历史，有它的特点，有它的许多珍贵品。对于这些，我们还是小学生。今天的中国是历史的中国的一个发展；我们是马克思主义的历史主义者，我们不应当割断历史。从孔夫子到孙中山，我们应当给以总结，承继这一份珍贵的遗产。”（《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》）而且，毛主席在《反对本本主义》一文中，还要求我们“学个孔夫子的‘每事问’”。对于这些，姚文元同志又该作何解释呢？
    海瑞当时是不是受到人民热爱？
    姚文元同志在自己论据不足时，就穿凿附会，钻牛角尖，凭主观想象进行推理，得出自己需要的结论，以达到驳倒对方的目的。现举一例说明。史书上记载，海瑞死后，“小民罢市，丧出江上，白衣冠送者夹岸，酹而哭者，百里不绝”。吴晗同志据此认为当时广大人民是尊敬和热爱海瑞的。姚文元同志为了驳倒这一点，证明海瑞并没有得到“真正广大人民”的尊敬和热爱，竟然作出如下的推理：“只要我们想一想，在解放前，广大贫苦农民在地主阶级残酷剥削下，穷得连衣服都穿不上，许多农民几代人穿一件破衣裳，自己家里死了亲人都没有丧服穿，就知道那时候能穿体体面面的‘白衣冠’来路祭的人，决不是贫农，决不是吴晗同志说的‘广大人民’，而只能是地主、富农和商人中的某些人。”好一个“想一想……就知道……”！屈原是深受我国人民尊敬和爱戴的。他投汨罗江自杀后，广大人民在每年五月五日划龙船（竞渡）、缚粽子来表示悼念。如果按照姚文元同志的这个“想一想”：在解放前（具体一点，古代）广大人民自己吃饭都成问题，那里还有闲情逸致去划龙船，那会有赢粮，而且还是上好的糯米扔到江里喂鱼呢？那么，岂不是“就知道”“那时候怀念、热爱屈原的人”，“决不是”“广大人民”，“而只能是地主、富农和商人中的某些人”么？岂不是可以由此得出结论：屈原并不受我国真正的“广大人民”的热爱吗！？
    显然，只要我们“想一想”，“就知道”姚文元同志这种立论是没有道理，站不住脚的！
    怎样看《海瑞罢官》的现实意义？
    姚文元同志在他的文章的最后一段里，说什么《海瑞罢官》要人们去学习“退田”“平冤狱”等等。这种理解，不禁使人大吃一惊。姚文元同志并不是天真无知的小朋友，看了《三剑客》就拿起棒去格斗，难道看了《海瑞罢官》就要去扯着公社社长的衣襟闹“退田”，抱住法院院长的大腿要“平冤狱”？！
    姚文元同志认为分析一个作品，应该把它同当时的现实生活联系起来。这一点，我完全同意。可是，姚文元同志据此硬把《海瑞罢官》和“单干风”“翻案风”扯在一起，断定《海瑞罢官》是当时“资产阶级反对无产阶级专政和社会主义革命”的“阶级斗争的一种形式的反映”，这恐怕有些不合情理。
    只要认真地把《海瑞罢官》读一读，想一想，就知道“退田”、“平冤狱”并不是该剧要表现的主要内容，而不过是借以渲染海瑞的部分情节而已。显然不能认为剧作者是要人们去学习“退田”“平冤狱”而去搞“单干”，闹“翻案”。退一步而论，《海瑞罢官》中尚有海瑞组织人民修吴淞江等情节，姚文元同志为什么不认为这是要人们在困难时期去兴修水利、防治天灾、克服困难呢？
    我觉得，《海瑞罢官》主要是渲染海瑞刚直不阿，不畏强暴，敢于斗争的精神。（作者在这方面，是犯有原则性的错误的，——拔高了海瑞，模糊了他的阶级本质，贬低了人民的斗争性等。）因此在困难时期正当国内外阶级敌人乘机向社会主义猖狂进攻的时候，为什么不能把此剧理解为旨在启发、教育人们敢于坚持真理，克服困难，敢于同坏人坏事斗争，同阶级敌人斗争呢？
    对于这一点，姚文元同志捕风捉影，牵强附会，把自己的主观臆断硬说成剧作者写剧的主观意旨，恐怕不是无产阶级应有的“严肃的战斗的科学态度”吧。
