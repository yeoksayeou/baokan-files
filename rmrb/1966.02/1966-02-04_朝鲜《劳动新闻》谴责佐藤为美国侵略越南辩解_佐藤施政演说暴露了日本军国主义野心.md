    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 2nd—The North Korean newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary on February 2nd, pointing out that Japanese Prime Minister Sato's "policy speech" on January 28th once again exposed his true colors as a loyal executor of the US imperialist aggression policy and even more clearly illustrated the Japanese militarists' attempt to use US imperialism to invade Asian countries.
    The commentary strongly condemned the Sato government's ugly behavior in defending the US imperialists' so-called "seeking peace" in the Vietnam issue. The commentary stated that the Sato government's approach is aimed at covering up the aggressive policy of its American masters, concealing their sinful nature of colluding with US imperialism to participate in the war of aggression against Vietnam, and attempting to deceive the Japanese people and the people of the world. This is an extremely clumsy trick.
    The commentary pointed out that after US imperialism resumed bombing the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 31st, the Sato clique hurriedly came forward to defend the US imperialists' aggressive behavior, and he was more active than anyone else, which was by no means accidental.
    The commentary stated that Sato's clamoring in his "policy speech" to "develop friendly relations with the United States" and faithfully fulfill the obligations of the US-Japan "Security Treaty" is an extremely blatant violation of the Japanese people's desire for national independence, democracy, and peace. It is a faithful response to the new demands of US imperialism to actively involve Japan in its policy of aggression against Asia, which once again exposes the Sato clique's sinister intentions.
    The commentary said that Sato also clamored for economic "assistance" and "cooperation" to Asian countries, which shows that the Japanese militarists are attempting to dress themselves up as "friends" of the Asian people, attempting to carry out large-scale capital exports, commodity exports, and technology exports in order to further strengthen the plunder and exploitation of these countries. The commentary concluded by saying that the Sato government's policy of following US imperialism will inevitably suffer tragic consequences.

    朝鲜《劳动新闻》谴责佐藤为美国侵略越南辩解
    佐藤施政演说暴露了日本军国主义野心
    新华社平壤二日电　朝鲜《劳动新闻》二日发表评论指出，日本首相佐藤一月二十八日发表的“施政演说”，再次暴露出他作为美帝国主义的侵略政策的忠实执行者的真面目，更加清楚地说明了日本军国主义想借助美帝国主义来侵略亚洲国家的企图。
    评论强烈谴责佐藤政府为美帝国主义在越南问题上，所谓“寻求和平”进行辩护的丑恶行径。评论说，佐藤政府的这种作法是为了掩盖它的美国主子的侵略政策，掩盖它们伙同美帝国主义参与侵略越南战争的罪恶本质，企图欺骗日本人民和世界人民。这是一种极其拙劣的手法。
    评论指出，在美帝国主义一月三十一日恢复对越南民主共和国领土的轰炸以后，佐藤集团急忙出面为美帝国主义的侵略行为辩解，他比任何人都积极，这绝非出于偶然。
    评论说，佐藤在“施政演说”中叫嚷要“发展同美国的友好关系”和忠实地承担日美“安全条约”上的义务，这是极其粗暴地违反了日本人民争取民族独立、民主与和平的愿望的，是对美帝国主义积极纠集日本参与它的侵略亚洲政策的新要求的忠实响应，这再次暴露出佐藤集团的险恶用心。
    评论说，佐藤还叫嚷对亚洲国家进行经济“援助”和“合作”，这说明日本军国主义者企图把自己打扮成亚洲人民的“朋友”，企图大规模地进行资本输出、商品输出和技术输出，以便进一步加强对这些国家的掠夺和剥削。评论最后说，佐藤政府追随美帝国主义的政策必将遭到悲惨的结果。
