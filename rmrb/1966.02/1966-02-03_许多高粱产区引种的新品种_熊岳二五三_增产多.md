    The New Sorghum Variety "Xiong Yue No. 253" Introduced in Many Sorghum Producing Areas Increases Production Significantly
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 2nd) The new sorghum variety "Xiong Yue No. 253," which is characterized by its preference for fertilizer, high yield, and wide adaptability, has been gradually推广 (tuī guǎng - popularized/promoted) from its place of origin, Liaoning Province, to major sorghum-producing areas such as the Shandong Peninsula, the North China Plain, and the Northwest Plateau. According to statistics from seven provinces and cities including Shandong, Hebei, Gansu, and Liaoning, the planting area of "Xiong Yue No. 253" reached more than 4.6 million mu in 1965, making it the most widely planted new sorghum variety in China.
    This variety has shown great yield-increasing performance in many places, generally increasing production by 40% to 50% compared to local varieties, and in some cases, increasing production by two to three times. The weaknesses of the "Xiong Yue No. 253" variety are that it has a longer growing period, is not resistant to waterlogging, and is not tolerant to saline-alkali soil.
    This new sorghum variety was selected and cultivated by the Xiong Yue Agricultural Science Research Institute of Liaoning Province from the local "Xiao Huang?" variety in 1951. In the selection and breeding process, much arduous and meticulous work was carried out, and it took six years of effort to successfully select and cultivate it.

    许多高粱产区引种的新品种
    “熊岳二五三”增产多
    据新华社沈阳二日电　具有喜肥、高产、适应性广等特点的高粱新品种——“熊岳二五三”，已由原产区辽宁省逐渐推广到山东半岛、华北平原和西北高原等高粱主要产区。据山东、河北、甘肃和辽宁等七个省市统计，一九六五年“熊岳二五三”的种植面积达四百六十多万亩，成为目前我国种植面积最广的一个高粱新品种。
    这个品种在许多地方表现出很大的增产性能，一般都比当地品种增产百分之四五十，多的增产两三倍。“熊岳二五三”品种的弱点是，生育期较长，不抗涝，不耐盐碱。
    这个高粱新品种，是辽宁省熊岳农业科学研究所在一九五一年从当地“小黄?”品种中选择培育出来的。在选育过程中，进行了许多艰苦细致的工作，经过六年的努力才选育成功。
