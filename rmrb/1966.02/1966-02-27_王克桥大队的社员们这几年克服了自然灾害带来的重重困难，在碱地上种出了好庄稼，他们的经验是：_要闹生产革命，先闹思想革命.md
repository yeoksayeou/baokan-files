    The Wangkeqiao Brigade's commune members have overcome the numerous difficulties brought about by natural disasters in recent years, growing good crops on alkali land. Their experience is:
　　To carry out a production revolution, first carry out a thought revolution
　　Yang Fengming, Secretary of the Party Branch of Wangkeqiao Brigade, Zhugezhuang Commune, Xiong County, Hebei Province
    We Wangkeqiao people are far behind Dazhai people. However, neighboring brother teams also know that the members of our Wangkeqiao team are willing to put in effort in production. Now, some tough guys and iron girls who are not afraid of hardship or difficulty have indeed emerged in our brigade. However, this is the spirit of today, and it was not like this before 1960. At that time, the big mountain of alkali land overwhelmed us, and we ate the country's grain every year. People were worried, complained, and did not work hard. In 1959, we studied Chairman Mao's "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and began to establish the confidence and courage to overcome difficulties. We worked hard for three winter and spring seasons, deeply plowing more than 500 mu of severely alkaline land to a depth of two and a half chi. This matter, the material gain is a small matter, the spiritual gain is a major matter. That deep plowing to improve alkali land gave the Wangkeqiao people a vivid lesson, strengthened their ambition, and dared to despise difficulties. Deep plowing to improve alkali land has become our spiritual wealth. When there are difficulties in our work, the revolutionary spirit of the people comes up when we mention deep plowing to improve alkali land.
    From this deep plowing to improve alkali land, we also understood a truth: Overcoming difficulties is a difficult task. If you do not overcome difficulties, it is even more uncomfortable to be overwhelmed by difficulties. The alkali land that had tormented us for many years has been transformed by us, no longer suffering from it, no longer its slaves. So when we encounter difficulties again, people put "action" first, do not endure, do not bow their heads, and resolutely revolt against it. In 1965, we encountered a drought that had not occurred in decades. In May and June, the small seedlings were twisted like ropes due to the drought. What to do? I thought, if the people of Wangkeqiao were to move like they did during the deep plowing to improve alkali land, not to mention using tools, even carrying water by hand, they could irrigate ten or twenty mu a day. We did it according to this idea, mobilizing more than 200 laborers and organizing more than 80 pairs of buckets to carry water to irrigate the land. As a result, in eight days, we generally irrigated the more than 500 mu of corn, achieving a good harvest of 509 jin per mu in 1965. People's revolutionary spirit of not fearing difficulties, being tenacious, and daring to fight is acquired in the struggle against difficulties. Without the deep plowing to improve alkali land in the past, there would be no victory in irrigating the land this time, there would be no good harvest, people would overcome nature, and difficulties would temper people's revolutionary spirit.
    Fighting with nature is a head-on collision. We are tough, and our toughness is our spiritual toughness, our ideological toughness. Difficulties are objectively existent; they cannot be thrown away or avoided. We have learned that the more you avoid difficulties and fear difficulties, the greater the difficulties become, and the more helpless you are. If you face difficulties head-on, look for difficulties to fight, you will find a way to solve the difficulties. In the spring of 1965, we were determined to greatly increase production. But what was the new way to increase production? We felt that to increase production, we had to change the old farming habits, changing the habit of planting only one season of sorghum to planting one season of corn and then one season of wheat. As soon as we talked about changing to planting corn, some people were frightened. They said, "This is not comparable to deep plowing; our land is not land for growing corn!" It seems that to make alkali land grow corn, we must first solve the problem of whether alkali land can grow corn. To carry out a production revolution, we must first carry out a thought revolution. To overthrow the difficulties in production, we must first overthrow the difficulties in thought. We first asked the agricultural technology department to help us find out why alkali land does not grow corn: Our alkali land is soda-saline alkali land, and the alkali returns heavily in spring and is severely compacted. And corn is the crop with the lowest alkali resistance. Agricultural technicians affirmed that as long as the seedlings can be preserved, corn can be harvested abundantly. In this way, we first solved the problem of whether alkali land can grow corn in our minds. Then, we adopted the method of digging high-yield pits in Dazhai and carried out bold trial planting. At the autumn harvest, one mu yielded more than 600 jin, and good land yielded more than 700 jin per mu. The successful trial planting of corn further encouraged our courage to overcome nature. After autumn, we planted wheat in the land where corn had been planted, using the method of ditch fertilization. Now, the wheat in these fields is growing even better than the wheat in the Hetao area. The old saying that soda-saline alkali land cannot grow wheat has been broken by us again. This time, it is not only a material harvest, but more importantly, it has increased our revolutionary spirit of despising difficulties. We have learned methods from difficulties and gained experience. Difficulties are schools, producing spirit, methods, and experience. Great difficulties are universities, and small difficulties are primary schools. Without overcoming the difficulty of changing alkali land to growing corn, there would be no substantial increase in production in 1965.
    In recent years, I have also had this experience when I went to backward teams several times: Backward teams have many problems, great difficulties, and deep knowledge. The experience gained in backward teams is more valuable and more convenient for guiding the work of the entire brigade. At the same time, when the work of backward teams catches up, the shock is great and the persuasiveness is strong. Take my going to the Fifth Team in 1965 as an example. As soon as I went to the Fifth Team, commune member Xu Genli said: "Fengming, if you can lead the Fifth Team well, I don't want my grain rations this year." Because of this kind of thinking, when mobilizing the masses to catch up with the advanced and seize red flags, the commune members said: "It is okay to seize red flags, but we must first change the land." It turned out that there were 32 mu of land in the Fifth Team with fire sand, and the yield was not high. It seems that the fire sand land scared the commune members. According to Chairman Mao's instructions in "On Practice," I first went to practice myself and found that only ten or so mu of the 32 mu of land had fire sand. It was about two cun thick under the soil layer about one chi deep. As long as it could be turned up and broken up, its harm would be completely eliminated. When the masses saw that it could be treated, they acted together. In a few days, the land with fire sand was turned over. The greater the difficulty, the greater the impact on production, and the more urgent the masses' hope to overcome it. The seedlings that grew out of the turned land were particularly strong. Matter turned into spirit, and people's enthusiasm for winning red flags also came. As a result, the Fifth Team's autumn output entered the ranks of the advanced and won the red flag. The backward team overcame difficulties and won the red flag, which further encouraged the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win of the commune members of the entire brigade.
    The result of fighting against nature and against difficulties tells us that difficulties are bad for the timid, but for revolutionaries, they will turn into good things. Difficulties are a crucible. Solving a difficulty means undergoing an exercise. The more difficulties you experience, the stronger you become.

    王克桥大队的社员们这几年克服了自然灾害带来的重重困难，在碱地上种出了好庄稼，他们的经验是：
　　要闹生产革命，先闹思想革命
　　河北省雄县朱各庄公社王克桥大队党支部书记　杨凤鸣
    我们王克桥人，比起大寨人来，差得很多。可是，邻近的兄弟队，也知道我们王克桥队的社员，在生产上是舍得出力气的。现在，我们大队也确实出现了一些不怕苦、不怕难的硬汉子和铁姑娘。不过，这是今天的精神面貌，在一九六○年以前并不是这样。那时，碱地这座大山，压得我们喘不过气来，年年吃国家的粮食。人们发愁、叫难，干活也不起劲。在一九五九年，我们学习了毛主席的《愚公移山》，开始树立了克服困难的信心和勇气，硬是大干三个冬春，把五百多亩重碱地深翻二尺半。这件事，物质收获是小事，精神收获是大事。那次深翻改碱，给王克桥人上了生动的一课，长了志气，敢于藐视困难了；深翻改碱变成了我们的精神财富，工作中有了困难，一提起深翻改碱来，人们的革命精神就上来了。
    从这一次深翻改碱中，我们也懂得了一条道理：克服困难是个难事，有困难不去克服，被困难压住就更难受。多年来的碱地被我们改造了，不受它的折磨了，不做它的奴隶了。所以再遇到困难，人们就“干”字当头，不忍受，不低头，坚决革它的命。一九六五年，遇上了几十年来没有过的大旱，五、六月的时候，小苗子旱的拧了绳。怎么办呢？我想，王克桥的人要是象深翻改碱的时候，都动起来，别说使工具，就是手捧，一天也浇它个十亩二十亩的。我们就按照这个想法去做了，出动了二百多名劳动力，组织起了八十多副水桶挑水浇地。结果用了八天就把五百来亩大棒子普遍浇了一遍，获得了一九六五年亩产五百零九斤的好收成。人们不怕难，顽强敢斗的革命精神和丰富的斗争经验，都是在向困难作斗争中取得的。没有过去的深翻改碱，就不会有这一次浇地的胜利，就不会有好的收成，人胜了天，困难也锻炼了人的革命精神。
    和自然斗，就是硬碰硬，我们硬，是我们的精神硬，思想硬。困难是客观存在的，扔不掉，躲不过。我们体会到，越是躲着困难，害怕困难，困难也就越大，越没有办法。要是迎着困难上，找困难打，解决困难的办法也就来了。一九六五年春天，我们下决心把产量大大提高一步。但是，新的增产路子是什么？我们觉得要增产，就得改变老的耕作习惯，把光种一季高粱的习惯，改成种一季大棒子，再种一季麦子。一说改种大棒子，有的人发了怵。他们说：“这可比不得深翻地，咱这地不是长棒子的地呀！”看来，要让碱地长出大棒子来，首先得解决碱地能不能长出大棒子的认识问题。要闹生产革命，得先闹思想革命，要想斗倒生产上的难，得先斗倒思想上的难。我们先请农业技术部门，帮助我们找出了碱地为什么不长棒子的原因：我们的碱地，是苏打性碱地，春天返碱重，板结厉害。而棒子又是抗碱能力最低的一种庄稼。农业技术干部肯定地说，只要能保住苗子，棒子就能丰收。这样，首先在思想上解决了碱地能不能长棒子的认识。接着，我们采用了大寨挖丰产坑的办法，进行了大胆的试种。秋收时，一亩地打了六百多斤，好的地一亩打了七百多斤。试种棒子成功，又进一步鼓舞了我们战胜自然的勇气，秋后，又在种过棒子的地里用沟施肥的方法种上了小麦。如今，这些地的小麦比河套地的小麦长的还好。苏打性碱地不能种麦的旧说法，又被我们打破了。这一回不光是物质上的收获，更重要的还是使我们增长了藐视困难的革命精神，从困难中学到了办法，取得了经验。困难是学校，出精神、出办法、出经验，大困难是大学校，小困难是小学校。克服不了碱地改种棒子的困难，就没有一九六五年大幅度的增产。
    这些年，我几次下后进队也有这个体会：后进队问题多，困难大，学问深，在后进队得出的经验，才是更有价值的经验，才更便于指导全大队的工作。同时，后进队的工作赶上来后，震动大，说服力强。就拿一九六五年我下第五队来说吧，我一到五队去，社员许根立就说：“凤鸣，你要把五队领导好了，我今年的口粮都不要了。”正因为有这种思想，在发动群众赶先进夺红旗时，社员们就说：“夺红旗行，得先换换地。”原来五队有三十二亩地里有火沙，产量不高。看来是火沙地把社员吓住了。我根据毛主席《实践论》的指示，首先去亲自实践，发现这三十二亩地里只有十来亩有火沙，它在一尺深左右的地层下，只有二寸来厚，只要能把它翻上来，打散它，就会完全消灭它的危害。群众一看能治，就一齐行动起来。不几天的时间就把有火沙的地翻了一遍。困难越大，对生产的影响越大，群众对战胜它的希望也越迫切。翻后的土地，长出来的苗子分外强，物质变成了精神，人们争红旗的劲头也来了。结果五队的秋季产量步入了先进行列，夺得了红旗。后进队战胜了困难，夺得了红旗，更鼓舞了全大队社员敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命干劲。
    向自然、向困难斗的结果告诉我们，困难，对怯懦的人说来是坏事，但对革命者来说，它会变成好事。困难是熔炉，解决一个困难，就受一次锻炼，经的困难越多，就锻炼得越坚强。
