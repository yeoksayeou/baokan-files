    Since the U.S. imperialists instigated a reactionary military coup in Brazil in April of the year before last, the military clique headed by Branco seized power and placed Brazil under fascist military dictatorship. For more than a year, U.S. imperialism has unscrupulously pursued neo-colonialism in Brazil, engaging in frantic plunder and oppression; its agents, the Brazilian reactionaries, have wholeheartedly served U.S. imperialism, pursuing a policy of selling out national interests, leaving Brazil completely devoid of independence. Eighty million Brazilians are in dire straits. This countercurrent appearing in Brazil is extremely rampant.
    However, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out many years ago, "Reactionary currents try to overwhelm the mainstream of national independence and people's democracy, but reactionary currents will ultimately not become the mainstream." The counter-revolutionary policies of U.S. imperialism and the Brazilian reactionaries have made the national contradictions between the Brazilian people and U.S. imperialism, as well as the class contradictions within Brazil, develop to an unprecedentedly acute degree. Because U.S. imperialism has shown the Brazilian people, through its extremely ferocious acts of aggression, that it is the most vicious enemy of the Brazilian nation, it has thus prompted the broad masses of the Brazilian people to become increasingly aware and to fight against the enslavement of U.S. imperialism, against the pro-American dictatorial regime, and to save their motherland. In the past year, the anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle of the Brazilian people has risen one after another, wave upon wave. The rule of the United States and its lackeys has aroused increasingly strong resistance from people of all strata in Brazil. In today's Brazil, there is a broader basis than ever before for establishing a united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.
    The people of all strata in Brazil will surely unite more closely under the banner of striving for national independence and will usher in a storm of anti-American revolutionary struggle. The document passed by the Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party last November put it well, "The days of dark clouds and impending storms experienced by Brazil will not continue indefinitely." Dark clouds are only a temporary phenomenon, even in the darkest hour, the cock crows unceasingly, the darkness must pass, and the dawn is ahead.

    黎明前的黑暗
    自从前年四月美帝国主义在巴西策动反动军事政变后，以布朗库为首的军人集团攫取了政权，就把巴西置于法西斯军事独裁统治之下。一年多以来，美帝国主义在巴西肆无忌惮推行新殖民主义，进行疯狂的掠夺和压迫；它的代理人，巴西反动派死心塌地为美帝国主义效劳，奉行出卖民族利益的政策，使巴西完全丧失了独立。八千万巴西人民处于水深火热之中。在巴西出现的这一股逆流，是十分猖獗的。
    但是，正如毛泽东同志在许多年前曾经指出的“反动的逆流企图压倒民族独立和人民民主的主流，但反动的逆流终究不会变为主流”。美帝国主义和巴西反动派的反革命政策，已使巴西人民同美帝国主义之间的民族矛盾以及巴西国内的阶级矛盾发展到了空前未有的尖锐程度。由于美帝国主义以自己穷凶极恶的侵略行动向巴西人民表明，它是巴西民族最凶恶的敌人，这样，它就促使广大的巴西人民日益觉醒，为反对美帝国主义的奴役、反对亲美独裁政权、拯救祖国而斗争。近一年来，巴西人民反美反独裁的斗争浪潮此伏彼起，一浪接一浪。美国及其走狗的统治激起了巴西各阶层人士越来越强烈的反抗。在今天的巴西，建立一条反对美帝国主义及其走狗的统一战线，存在着比过去任何时候都更广泛的基础。
    巴西各阶层人民必将在争取民族独立的旗帜下日益团结起来，兴起反美革命斗争的风暴。巴西共产党中央去年十一月通过的文件说得好，巴西“所经历的满天乌云、风雨欲来的日子，不会无限期的延续下去”。满天乌云不过是暂时的现象，风雨如晦，鸡鸣不已，黑暗一定要过去，曙光就在前头。
