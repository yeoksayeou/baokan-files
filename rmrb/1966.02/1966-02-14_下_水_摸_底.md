　　下“水”摸“底”
　　Liaoyuan Power Plant planner Zhang Weiqin once went to the factory's workers' bathhouse, stripped off his clothes and got into the pool. After getting into the water, he didn't take a bath, but instead began feeling the tiles in the pool, saying as he felt them, "Hmm, this one's broken, and another one..."
　　What was Zhang Weiqin doing? It turned out that he had encountered a difficulty when approving the bathhouse repair plan in the office. He didn't have a clear idea of how many tiles should be bought. If he approved too few, it wouldn't be enough, and if he approved too many, it would be a waste. Later, he thought, "Wouldn't I know if I checked the bathhouse?" As a result, he reduced the number of new tiles to be bought, both repairing the bathhouse and avoiding waste.
　　Do many of our comrades who sit in offices to make plans and draft proposals encounter difficulties like Zhang Weiqin, where they don't get to the bottom of things? If so, they should learn from Zhang Weiqin's method, get out of the office, and personally go "into the water" to get to the "bottom" of things.

    下“水”摸“底”
    辽源发电厂计划员张维勤，有一次来到本厂工人浴池，脱光衣服下到水池里。他下水以后并不洗澡，却摸起池里的磁砖来，边摸边说：“唔，这块坏了，又一块……”。
    张维勤这是干啥呢？原来，他在办公室里审批维修澡堂计划的时候，发生了一个困难，心中没有底，不知道应买多少磁砖。如果批少了不够用，批多了又浪费。后来，他想：“到澡堂检查一下子不就知道了吗？”结果，减少了买新磁砖的数量，既维修了澡堂，又避免了浪费。
    我们不少坐在办公室里订计划、拟方案的同志，有没有碰到像张维勤那样不摸底的困难呢？如果也有的话，他们应该学学张维勤的办法，走出办公室，亲自下“水”去摸一摸“底”。
