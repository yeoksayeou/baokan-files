　　Editor's Note: The Shanghai Dexin Smelting Factory was originally a so-called "garbage factory" ruled by capitalists. Our Party transformed it into a revolutionary socialist enterprise. This small factory with only seventy-odd people has produced some cutting-edge products needed by the country in recent years.
　　If the country needs zinc sulfate, they extract zinc sulfate from waste materials. If users need aluminum powder, they overcome all difficulties to produce aluminum powder. If users need high-quality aluminum powder, they do everything possible to produce high-quality aluminum powder. They truly respond to every user's request.
　　What does this small factory rely on to achieve such great results? Foreign equipment? They don't have it. Foreign technology? They don't have it either. They rely on politics, they rely on people. All equipment and technology are created by people. With highly conscious people, equipment and technology suitable for their own needs can be created. And such equipment and technology, under their own conditions, are often irreplaceable by foreign equipment and foreign technology.
　　Daqing people say: "We don't rely on heaven, we don't rely on earth, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought, we rely on the proletarian spirit." The situation of the Dexin Smelting Factory is the same.
　　Daqing got rid of the backward label of China's petroleum industry by relying on this. The Dexin Smelting Factory also got rid of the backward enterprise label by relying on this. The Chinese people must also rely on this to get rid of the "poor and blank" label.
　　As long as we emphasize politics and use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, we will have everything and be able to do everything. This is true for large enterprises like Daqing, and it is also true for small enterprises like Dexin.
　　Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: Comrade Chen Xinyu, a representative of advanced individuals on the national industrial and transportation front, an excellent Party branch secretary, and Party branch secretary and factory director of the Shanghai Dexin Smelting Factory, delivered a report entitled "Emphasize Politics, Small Factory Achieves Great Things" at the expanded meeting of the National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference on the 18th, which was warmly welcomed and greatly valued by all representatives.
　　The Shanghai Dexin Smelting Factory is a small factory with only seventy-odd people, but because the Party organization of this factory held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly defended the proletarian position, mobilized and united all factory workers, and launched a life-and-death struggle against capitalist forces in urban and rural areas, it repelled the attacks of capitalist forces and achieved one victory after another. It transformed a "garbage factory" originally ruled by capitalists into a revolutionary and modern socialist enterprise. In 1965, the profits turned over to the state were equivalent to six times the factory's total fixed assets, and it also produced new products.
　　Vice Premier Bo Yibo spoke after Comrade Chen Xinyu's report. He said: "A small factory, under the leadership of young workers with limited education, has developed so many new products and created the highest labor productivity in the country (120,000 yuan per person per year). It raises a directional question for us: What path should China's industrial development take? Should China's industrial construction implement a combination of large, medium, and small-sized industries? Large industries can and have already made a name for themselves, but what about medium and small industries, especially small factories? They are not backward, and they are constantly challenging large enterprises and large factories. The Dexin Smelting Factory is a representative of this. Whether in terms of innovation and invention or in terms of improving labor productivity, it has done things that large factories in the same industry have not done.
　　Since ancient times, many miracles in the world have often been created by so-called 'lower-class little people,' so-called 'stupid' people with limited knowledge. Living in this great era, we have Mao Zedong Thought, we have the incomparably superior socialist system, and our inventions and creations will undoubtedly be more numerous than in any past era.
　　Small cities and small factories can liberate their minds and achieve more not only because they are small, but also because they are 'poor.' Small factories like the Shanghai Dexin Factory are everywhere in our country. As long as we arm them with Mao Zedong Thought, take class struggle as the key link, closely rely on the masses, and believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, we can create miracles and make greater contributions to socialist construction."
　　The summary of Comrade Chen Xinyu's report is as follows:
　　Capitalists tried every means to win me over, but I refused. The Party organization pointed out to me: I must be vigilant and not be fooled.
　　I was originally a worker. In 1957, the Party sent me to the Shanghai Dexin Smelting Factory as a public representative, and later I became the Party Branch Secretary.
　　The Dexin Smelting Factory was formed in 1957 by merging eighteen handicraft workshops. At that time, there were more than 140 employees, including more than 20 capitalists and small business owners. There was not a single Party member in the entire factory. It mainly used the waste materials from steel mills and machine factories to produce non-ferrous metals. The entire factory did not have a single machine, only hearth furnaces, blow furnaces, and bellows; operations were done using stone mortars, wooden buckets, and other tools. The surrounding residents called this factory a "garbage factory." The vast majority of workers were illiterate. Due to the oppression, deception, and instigation by capitalists, there were factional struggles and superstitious activities within the workers. For example, when smelting copper, they would burn paper to pray to gods, and it was stipulated that women could not go to the stove, saying that if women went to the stove, they would not be able to smelt copper.
　　Although this factory was very small, the class struggle was very acute. Among the capitalists, a small number of people engaged in very serious illegal activities. The previous public representative was dragged down by these few illegal capitalists. When I first came to this factory, the workers were very indifferent to me; while several capitalists were very kind to me and tried every means to win me over. One capitalist said, "Representative Chen is the first Party member representative to come to our factory, we are very honored, we are a family from now on. I am very eager to have friends, you can tell me about any problems." He also asked me what my hobbies were, what kind of operas I liked to watch, and promoted that when watching opera, one must see famous performers, and what famous dishes to eat at what restaurants. As soon as he heard that I liked to watch movies, they immediately bought a movie ticket and sent it to me, which I refused.
　　At that time, the conditions in the factory were very poor, there was no canteen, and the workers ate in the workshop with lunch boxes. The capitalist told me that eating in the workshop was unsanitary, and pulled me to his room to eat, and prepared exquisite bowls for me. I didn't go. I said I was a worker and still ate with the workers in the workshop. Once, the superior company held a meeting, and I went with the private sector to participate. At noon, when eating at the restaurant, the capitalist ordered a table of wine and dishes and insisted on inviting me to eat, which I resolutely refused. A few days later, the capitalist's concubine came to win me over several times, but I sternly refused. I reported this situation to the higher Party organization in a timely manner. The Party organization pointed out that I should be vigilant and not be fooled.
　　During the day, I participated in labor, and at night, I slept in the factory with the workers. I got close to the workers during labor.
　　At that time, the workers ignored me and the work could not be carried out. I was very anxious. I thought that the workers in this factory were too backward. Later I thought it was wrong. How could I say that the workers in other factories were good, but the workers in our factory were all backward? After thinking carefully, I still found the problems in my own way of thinking and working style: The Party promoted me to be a cadre, but I did not first learn the hard work style from the old cadres, but first bought a new suit and a pair of new leather shoes, and often talked to the workers with my hands in my pockets, which created a distance from the workers. The next day, I took off my new clothes and leather shoes, put on my work clothes, participated in labor during the day, and slept in the factory with the workers at night. I got close to the workers during labor.
　　One day, I helped the old worker Hu Xingyou pan for copper, and talked about family matters while working. I said, "Master Hu, you must have suffered a lot in the old society at such an old age. Although I am younger than you, I have also suffered a lot. I have been begging for food since I was a child. I worked as a hired hand in the landlord's house at the age of thirteen. In order to escape being drafted into the army, I fled to Shanghai, where I worked as a porter and pulled a cart. Later, I entered the Zhongyuan Smelting Factory as an electrolytic worker. In 1952, I participated in the 'Five Antis' movement, democratic reform, and my awareness gradually improved, and I joined the Party. Last year, I was still a worker. The Party and the government sent me here to be a public representative." The old worker looked at me and said, "So you also came from a poor background. I have suffered too much, it's hard to say everything." He also said, "Although Shanghai has been liberated, our factory has not been liberated yet. We are still oppressed by capitalists. Not long ago, the boss's wife slapped the table and scolded me; every time a prize is awarded, the workers can't get it, it's always the capitalists; what's even more annoying is that when the capitalists celebrate their birthdays, they want us workers to give gifts and kowtow." I was very angry when I heard this, but the workers were telling me their heartfelt words, and I was very happy. Later, other workers also came up to chat with me in twos and threes, which made me further understand the inside story of the factory and the capitalists.
　　To improve production, we must first raise the workers' class consciousness and draw a clear line between bourgeois ideology and proletarian ideology.
　　At that time, I thought that this factory had not undergone democratic reform in the past. To improve production, we must first make up for this lesson of democratic reform, raise the workers' class consciousness, and draw a clear line between bourgeois and proletarian ideologies. For example, workers were influenced by the old society and asked to invite "Taijun" and burn paper money when smelting copper. If this superstitious activity is not eliminated and the masses' awareness is not raised, how can production be improved? How can we make the workers not believe in "Taijun"? At this time, I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings, and we cannot use simple orders to solve this problem. Chairman Mao said that the peasants should throw away the Bodhisattvas themselves, and the memorial temples to chaste women and filial sons should be destroyed by the peasants themselves. It is not right for others to do it for them. Therefore, I repeatedly carried out propaganda to the masses. The old worker Hu Xingyou said, "In the old society, I spent money to burn incense and pray to the gods at the beginning of the year, hoping to have a better life, but I prayed every year, and life became worse every year. After liberation, I stopped burning incense, and my life has been getting better day by day." After repeated education, the workers' awareness gradually improved. Everyone realized that to turn over and be liberated, we must follow the Communist Party, and believing in "Taijun" is useless.
　　On this basis, I also transferred the female workers in the factory to the furnace room to help the workers load materials and extract copper. After a month or so, the task was completed very well. Through this incident, the workers also realized that the so-called women cannot go to the stove is the influence of the old society, and they no longer believe in it.
　　In order to develop their own forces, several capitalists in the factory divided the workers into Henan gangs, Hubei gangs, and Shaoxing gangs, dividing the workers' unity. At that time, the capitalist who held real power was from Henan, and the welfare benefits of the Henan workers in the aluminum smelting workshop were particularly high. Other capitalists incited the workers from the Shaoxing gang and the Hubei gang to seize the small faults of the Henan workers. There was no cooperation in production, and the workers fought at every turn. I wanted to solve this problem, and first of all, I had to fundamentally raise the workers' awareness. On the one hand, I promoted the principle that the working class of the world is one family to the masses, and on the other hand, I did the work of individual people, especially the work of key figures, to inspire them to recall and compare, and expose the capitalists' conspiracy methods. When the awareness of these comrades was raised, they held unity meetings and told their own experiences. The workers from the Shaoxing gang said: In the past, we recognized the wrong people, regarded our own class brothers as enemies, and regarded the capitalists as relatives. We were fooled by the capitalists. Now Lao Chen has helped us improve our understanding. In the future, we must strengthen unity and do a good job in production. The workers from the Henan gang also said that the unreasonable welfare benefits should be abolished. Later, the workers gradually unified the welfare benefits. Then, I organized everyone to learn technology from each other and launched a production competition, so that the unity among the workers was gradually strengthened.
　　He is our class brother. His thinking is backward, we can't blame him, mainly because my work has not been done well.
　　I patiently helped some workers with relatively backward thinking to improve their awareness. Comrade Cao Guangju was a well-known big gun in the factory, the most capable of arguing. When I was giving a report, he was scolding me below, saying that I was selling dog skin plaster, telling the workers not to listen to me, and even saying that if I continued to speak, he would beat me up. I thought that this person was making such a fuss, and it would be enough to send him to labor education. Later, I learned that he also came from a poor background. He lost his father at a young age. When there was a famine in Henan, he wandered to Shanghai and suffered all kinds of hardships in the old society. He didn't even have a quilt in winter. Because he was helpless and could not get warmth in the old society, he developed a bad temper and scolded and fought at every turn. I thought, he is our class brother. His thinking is backward, we can't blame him, mainly because my work has not been done well. Later, I took the initiative to care about his thoughts and life. Once, he was sick and recuperating at home. I visited him. He was very nervous, worried that the factory would fire him. I comforted him and asked him to recuperate quietly. I also hired a doctor to treat him and sent his salary to his home. I often talked to him about revolutionary principles and compared the differences between the new and old societies. Once, during a conversation, his thoughts were touched, and he cried excitedly. He said, "In the old society, I was fired from the factory by the capitalist when I got sick. Now that I am sick, the cadres care about me so much. I must not let the Party down." Before his illness was completely cured, he came to the factory to work. We took care of him to do light work, but he chose to do heavy work. I also constantly educated him, telling him not only to actively engage in production, but also to establish the idea of serving the people. He actively participated in learning culture, read many revolutionary books, and made up his mind to change his bad temper, keep up with the new situation, and strive to be a Communist Party member. From then on, he had a great transformation. Not only did he not argue with others, but he also worked hard and did good deeds for everyone. Every morning, he arrived at the factory early to do the production preparation work for each workshop, picked up old wood to make washstands for everyone, and sewed windproof curtains for each workshop with old sacks. He also did ideological work for others. The masses said that he had completely changed. Later, the workers elected him as the propaganda committee member of the trade union. He joined the Party in 1959 and is now the deputy secretary of the Party branch.
　　Now the workers are no longer doing the work of the capitalists, the workers turn over to be masters, and the back must be straightened.
　　There was also an "old good guy" named Wang Xinjing who was so oppressed by the capitalists that he did not dare to say a word. He was an "old good guy" who did not offend anyone. Once, I took the initiative to talk to him about family matters, and he was very nervous, saying, "I did not tell the capitalists about the situation of your meeting." I saw that he was very nervous, so I didn't say anything more. Later, I kept getting closer to him and learned that he was so poor before liberation that he couldn't even afford to support his wife, and his life only slowly turned over after liberation. I said to him: "Now the workers are no longer doing the work of the capitalists, the workers turn over to be masters, and the back must be straightened." Later, I asked him to attend any meetings. Originally, because the capitalists used petty favors to win him over, he felt that the capitalists were not bad, but after education, he gradually understood that this was a means of exploitation by the capitalists. His awareness improved, his courage increased, and he dared to stand up and expose the various criminal activities of the capitalists. He was also very active in production and loved the factory like his home everywhere. In 1960, he was elected as a representative of the people of Shanghai, and has been a five-good worker for several years.
　　There was also an old worker named Cheng Ashuang, who used to be a servant in the capitalist's house. After the public-private partnership, she worked as a cook in the factory. This comrade worked very actively, but her awareness was not high. She would flatter me like she flattered the capitalists. Later, I often told her revolutionary stories, organized her to participate in the newspaper reading group, invited her to participate in various meetings in the factory, and focused on solving her sense of inferiority and inspiring her to establish a sense of ownership. She was very moved to see that we treated her so equally. She said: "Thanks to the Party's education, I understood that after turning over, I must raise my head and be the master." She also said that she must run the cafeteria well. From then on, she tried various ways to understand the workers' tastes and improve the food. She also actively studied politics and culture and quickly improved her awareness. In 1959, Cheng Ashuang joined the Party.
　　The workers' awareness improved, their eyes were sharpened, the capitalists' criminal activities were exposed, and the masses fought against them. At the same time, the Party's strength also expanded. Fourteen party members were developed one after another, and in 1958 we established a Party branch.

　　After the workers' awareness is improved, they will make a production revolution.

　　After the workers' awareness is improved, they will make a production revolution. Our "garbage factory" used to be heavy manual labor with very high labor intensity. After operating in the hearth furnace room with a high temperature of more than 1,000 degrees for half an hour, the smelters would feel dizzy, breathless, and have heart palpitations, and they had to lie on the mud to rest. In winter, the copper panning workers soaked their hands in cold water to pan for copper sand, which was bone-chilling, and they really felt cold in their hands and pain in their hearts. The old worker Hu Xingyou, whose ancestors for three generations were copper panning workers, said, "We have suffered for generations, and we can no longer let the next generation suffer this suffering." He firmly stated that the backward operation must be changed to mechanization. He and the workers got a scrapped stone mill from a brother factory, designed and modified it by themselves, and turned crushing and panning for copper into mechanization, which increased efficiency by more than ten times and saved twenty-seven workers.
　　After the copper panning work was changed to mechanization, the smelting process was still heavy manual labor, which could not keep up with production needs. We also organized the workers to visit the Shanghai Smelting Factory. When the workers arrived at the factory, they saw that the machines were all big guys. Everyone said: We have seen foreign things, but we must make indigenous things and make stoves that we can use. They couldn't design and draw drawings, so they used mud to make models. Dozens of people worked together and made a total of more than thirty. Everyone discussed and improved them, and made a clay open-hearth furnace model that everyone was satisfied with, and arranged them in a dragon according to the different temperatures of metal smelting. The place with low firepower smelts aluminum, the place with strong firepower smelts copper scraps, and the place with the strongest firepower smelts copper sand. The comrades who boiled water saw that they wanted to combine the stove for boiling water; the cook comrades also said that you are all "cooperating," and I cannot work alone, and asked to make a stove next to it to use the residual heat of the furnace to boil water and cook rice. In this way, one stove can be used for five purposes. After the model came out, some people said that this kind of stove was not good, and some people said it was good. What should we do? We held a branch committee meeting to discuss it, affirmed it, and decided to build a clay open-hearth furnace by ourselves. At that time, there were no refractory bricks, so we went to some large factories to pick up scrapped refractory bricks, and worked for three days and three nights, and finally built the clay open-hearth furnace. The output of the smelting process increased from the original one ton per day to ten tons; it used to take thirty people, but now only eleven people are needed; coal consumption was also greatly reduced, from more than 1,000 kilograms per ton of copper in the past to only 200 kilograms now; it used to take 1,700 kilograms to melt one ton of aluminum, but now it only takes 80 kilograms.
　　Once again, we needed a coal powder injection machine for technical innovation. After discussing with the workers, they said: Let's find a way to make the coal powder injection machine ourselves. Therefore, according to the production characteristics of our factory, everyone worked separately. Some worked on the coal feeding part, and some worked on the coal injection part. After working hard for several days and nights, we made a clay coal powder injection machine, which was small, flexible, and very efficient.
　　If the road is right, we must continue to walk it.
　　We not only relied on our own efforts and carried out technical innovation in a big way to improve labor conditions, but also took the initiative to find tasks, expand varieties, and meet the needs of national construction. The workers said: In the past, we panned for copper in garbage, but there are other treasures in the garbage. We must find out all the treasures. Later, everyone discovered that there was also ammonium sulfate in the waste materials entering the factory. If these ammonium sulfate could be extracted, it would be an important material to support agriculture. But at that time, we didn't have the trial production fee. What should we do? Everyone went to brother factories to find some waste materials and cobbled together a set of indigenous equipment. Finally, we were short of a pressure gauge, so the workers thought of using a foreign bubble (balloon) instead. When the pressure was high, the foreign bubble swelled; when the pressure was low, the foreign bubble also shrank, which was very effective. Everyone said: The foreign bubble is better than the pressure gauge. Later, when it was officially put into production, we used a bladder instead of the pressure gauge. In this way, relying on the indigenous equipment we made ourselves, we extracted ammonium sulfate.
　　After one treasure was found, everyone's enthusiasm was even higher, and they found zinc in the garbage. Zinc sulfate is an urgently needed material for the development of man-made fibers, and our country's production cannot meet the needs. How good it would be if we could extract it! At the beginning, we always used the fire smelting method in the experiment, but it failed several times. In the face of difficulties, we asked the old cadres who participated in the 25,000-mile Long March to talk about the story of overcoming difficulties when climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands. After listening to everyone, their confidence was very strong, and they said: The predecessors shed blood and sacrificed for the revolution, that is the real difficulty; what does it matter if we use our brains and sweat more now! When they were on the Long March, if a road in the mountains was blocked, they would take a road in the water; now we are recycling zinc, if we can't go in the fire, we will go in the water. Therefore, we went to chemical factories to visit and study, and experimented with chemical methods to take out the zinc. Without trial production funds, we used small coal ball stoves, basins, etc. for experiments, and finally smelted zinc sulfate. However, the cost of this zinc sulfate was relatively high, at more than 1,000 yuan per ton, while the national purchase price was only 700 yuan. Some people doubted and said: "Should we not do it?" We mobilized the masses to discuss whether our road was right or not. Finally, everyone unanimously agreed that if the road is right, we must continue to walk it. If the cost is high, we can find ways to reduce it. After the workers carried out technical innovation in a big way, the cost of zinc sulfate per ton in our factory has been greatly reduced.
　　There are only ten workers in our factory extracting zinc sulfate, and they are all using indigenous equipment. Last year, we produced more than 500 tons, and this year we will expand to 800 tons without increasing the number of people. The equipment for producing zinc sulfate is not enough, so the workers go to the large factories' waste equipment and materials to find it. Recently, we found a kind of waste equipment in a dye factory that is very suitable for our use, so we asked them to give it to us. We pieced it together and installed it, and we can improve the production of zinc sulfate.
　　We didn't eat the guts of a tiger, but we learned Mao Zedong Thought.
　　Aluminum powder from steel mills is an important material to improve the yield of cast steel, and Shanghai does not produce aluminum powder. The aluminum powder used by steel mills has to be transported from other places. And our factory has a lot of waste aluminum. Since the country needs it for construction, we must produce it. The technology of producing aluminum powder is difficult to master and is prone to combustion and explosion. When some people found out about this, they said: These people really ate the guts of a tiger. The workers said: We didn't eat the guts of a tiger, but we learned Mao Zedong Thought. Everyone despised difficulties strategically and paid attention to difficulties tactically, and carried out repeated experiments seriously. Our small factory did not have a laboratory, so we borrowed the laboratory of a large factory for experiments. After the experiment was successful, the leaders asked us to carry out small-scale production for the steel mill to try out. We didn't have the equipment. The workers said: Let's move the equipment in the laboratory of the large factory to the factory to carry out small-scale production. After consulting with the other party, they strongly supported us, so we moved their equipment to the factory. We started production without even installing the motor feet. As soon as the sample came out, there were many units that wanted the goods. The superiors allocated us 120,000 yuan and asked us to build a new aluminum powder workshop. Our small factory had never received so much money, and some people got hot-headed and wanted to build a south-facing workshop and an east-facing warehouse. We let the masses discuss how to use the funds. Many workers said: What the country urgently needs is aluminum powder, not beautiful factory buildings. We must live a rich life like a poor life, and use one yuan of the country's money as two yuan. According to this spirit, we did not build new factory buildings, and we made all the equipment that we could make ourselves. As a result, we only spent more than 20,000 yuan to build it. All the remaining money was turned over to the state. Some people said we were fools for doing this, but the workers in the factory criticized us: If we calculated more carefully, we wouldn't even need more than 20,000 yuan, only a few thousand yuan would be enough. For example, the equipment needed an air compressor. Because the time was urgent, we spent more than 10,000 yuan to buy a new one. If we bought an old one, we wouldn't have to spend so much money. I accepted the criticism of the workers and made a sincere self-criticism to the workers.
　　Later, a scientific research unit needed a high-quality aluminum powder and also ran to our small factory to ask for assistance. At that time, the aluminum powder we produced was relatively coarse and far from their requirements. However, when we heard the comrades of this unit say that this kind of aluminum powder was very useful and the country urgently needed it, we all said that we must produce it. We said to the comrades of this scientific research unit: You wait in the hotel, we will start immediately. He asked us how much money we wanted, and we said: No money. Everyone put a lot of thought into it, made some improvements to the existing equipment, and produced this high-quality aluminum powder without spending any money. The other party was very happy to get this kind of aluminum powder and said that they would suggest that the superiors invest in us. We said to him: We don't want national investment, you can come again if you need it in the future.
　　In recent years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Municipal Party Committee, we have taken class struggle as the key link, adhered to the four firsts, emphasized politics, and armed the minds of the workers and masses with Mao Zedong Thought. The mental outlook of the people has undergone great changes, and the production outlook of the factory has also undergone great changes. In 1957, the labor productivity was more than 14,000 yuan per person per year, and in 1965 it reached 120,000 yuan; the profit turned over to the state in 1965 reached 1.21 million yuan, equivalent to six times the fixed assets of our factory.

　　突出政治　小厂办大事
　　上海德新冶炼厂党支部书记兼厂长陈鑫煜同志的报告（摘要）
    编者按：上海德新冶炼厂原来是一个被资本家统治的所谓“垃圾工厂”，我们党把它改造成为革命化的社会主义企业。这个只有七十多人的小工厂，几年来生产了一些国家需要的尖端产品。
    国家需要硫酸锌，他们就从废料中提炼出硫酸锌。用户需要铝粉，他们就排除万难炼出了铝粉。用户需要高质量的铝粉，他们就千方百计制出了高质量的铝粉。真正是用户有求，他们必应。
    这个小工厂靠什么取得这样大的成绩呢？靠洋设备吗？他们没有。靠洋技术吗？他们也没有。他们靠的是政治，靠的是人。任何设备和技术都是人创造的。有了高度觉悟的人，就会创造出适合自己需要的设备和技术。而这样的设备和技术，在自己的条件下，常常是洋设备、洋技术所无法代替的。
    大庆人说：“不靠天，不靠地，靠的是毛泽东思想，靠的是无产阶级志气。”德新冶炼厂的情况也是这样。
    大庆甩掉了我国石油工业落后的帽子，靠这个。德新冶炼厂甩掉了落后企业的帽子，也靠这个。中国人民要甩掉“一穷二白”的帽子，也一定要靠这个。
    只要突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，我们就会无所不有，无所不能。象大庆这样的大企业是这样，象德新这样的小企业也是这样。
    新华社二十二日讯　全国工业交通战线先进人物代表、优秀的党支部书记、上海德新冶炼厂党支部书记兼厂长陈鑫煜同志十八日在全国工业交通工作会议、全国工业交通政治工作会议扩大会议上作的“突出政治、小厂办大事”的报告，受到了全体代表的热烈欢迎和极大重视。
    上海德新冶炼厂是个只有七十多人的小厂，但由于这个厂的党组织高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚守无产阶级阵地，发动和团结全厂职工，与城乡资本主义势力展开了你死我活的斗争，击退了资本主义势力的进攻，取得了一个又一个胜利。把一个原来被资本家统治的“垃圾工厂”，改造成为革命化、现代化的社会主义企业。一九六五年上交给国家的利润相当于全厂固定资产的六倍，还生产了新产品。
    薄一波副总理在陈鑫煜同志报告后讲了话，他说：“一个小工厂在文化程度不高的青年工人同志领导下，搞出了这么多新产品，又创造了全国最高的劳动生产率（每人每年十二万元）。它为我们提出了一个带方向性的问题：我国工业发展应该走什么道路？我国工业建设是实行大中小并举，大工业可以而且有些已经搞出大名堂，而中小工业特别是小厂情况怎样呢？它们并不落后，而且不断向大企业大工厂提出挑战。德新冶炼厂就是一个代表。它不论在创造发明方面或者在提高劳动生产率方面，都做出了它同行业的大厂所没有做到的事情。
    自古以来，世界上很多奇迹，往往是人们所谓的‘下层阶级的小人物’，知识不高的所谓‘愚蠢’的人所创造出来的。处在我们这个伟大的时代，我们有毛泽东思想，有无比优越的社会主义制度，我们的创造发明无论如何会比过去任何时代都多。
    小城市小工厂不但因为它小，而且因为它‘穷’，就更可以解放思想，更有所作为。象上海德新这样小厂，我国到处都有，只要用毛泽东思想把它武装起来，以阶级斗争为纲，紧紧依靠群众，相信群众的智慧和力量，就可以创造奇迹，就可以为社会主义建设作出更大的贡献。”
    陈鑫煜同志的报告摘要如下：
    资本家千方百计想拉拢我，被我拒绝了。党组织向我指出：要提高警惕，不要上当。
    我原是一个工人，一九五七年党派我到上海德新冶炼厂当公方代表，后来担任党支部书记。
    德新冶炼厂，是一九五七年由十八个手工业作坊合并起来的。当时有职工一百四十多人，其中资本家、小业主就有二十多人。全厂没有一个党员。主要是利用炼钢厂、机械厂的边脚废料生产有色金属。全厂没有一台机器，只有墩炉、鼓风炉、手风箱；操作用的是石臼、木斗等工具。周围居民称这个厂是“垃圾厂”。工人绝大部分是文盲，由于受资本家的压榨、欺骗、挑拨，在工人内部有派别斗争和迷信活动。如在炼铜时要烧纸求神，规定妇女不能上炉灶，说妇女上了炉灶就炼不出铜。
    这个厂虽然很小，但是阶级斗争很尖锐。资本家当中有少数人违法活动非常严重，前任公方代表就是被这少数不法资本家拉下水的。我初到这个工厂时，工人看到我很冷淡；而几个资本家对我倒很亲热，千方百计想拉拢我。有个资本家说：“陈代表是第一个党员代表到我们厂里来，我们很荣幸，以后是一家人了。我是很要朋友的，有什么问题可以对我讲。”又问我有什么爱好？喜欢看什么戏？向我宣传看戏要看那些名角，上那些饭馆吃什么名菜。一听到我欢喜看电影，他们马上就去买了一张电影票送给我，被我拒绝了。
    当时，厂里条件很差，没有食堂，工人都端着饭盒在车间里吃饭。资本家对我说，车间里吃饭不卫生，拉我到他房里吃，并且为我备了精致的饭碗。我没有去，我讲我是工人，仍和工人一起在车间里吃饭。有一次，上级公司召开会议，我和私方一起去参加，中午在饭店吃饭时，资本家叫来了一桌酒席，一定要请我吃饭，我坚决不吃。过了几天，资本家的小老婆又几次来拉拢我，都被我严加拒绝。我把这情况及时向上级党组织汇报。党组织指出，要我提高警惕，不要上当。
    白天参加劳动，晚上同工人睡在厂里，在劳动中我和工人接近了。
    当时，工人不理我，工作开展不起来，我心里很焦急。我想，这个厂的工人实在太落后了，后来想想不对，怎么能说别厂工人好，我们这个厂工人都落后呢？我仔细想了又想，还是找到了自己思想方法、工作作风上的毛病：党提拔我当干部，我没有首先向老干部学习艰苦朴素的作风，而是先买了一套新衣服，一双新皮鞋，经常两只手插在口袋里同工人讲话，这样和工人有了距离。第二天，我就脱下了新衣服和皮鞋，换上了工作服，白天参加劳动，晚上同工人睡在厂里。在劳动中我和工人接近了。
    有一天，我帮助老工人胡兴友淘铜，边劳动边和他谈家常。我说：“胡师傅，你这样大的年纪在旧社会受苦一定很深，我虽然年纪比你小，我也吃过不少苦。从小就讨饭，十三岁在地主家当长工，为了逃避抽壮丁，又逃到上海，当过搬运工，拉大车，后来进了中原冶炼厂当电解工。一九五二年，我参加了‘五反’运动，民主改革，觉悟慢慢提高了，入了党。去年我还是工人，是党和政府派我到这里来当公方代表的。”这个老工人看着我说：“原来你也是苦出身。我受苦太多了，一言难尽”。他又说：“上海虽然解放了，可是我们这个厂还没有解放，现在还受资本家压迫。不久前，老板娘还拍桌子骂我；每次评奖，工人评不上，都评资本家；更气人的是资本家做寿，还要我们工人送礼、叩头。”我听了很气，但是，工人和我讲知心话了，我感到很高兴。以后其他工人也三三两两的凑上来同我谈心了，使我进一步了解厂里和资本家的底细。
    要把生产搞上去，首先要提高工人的阶级觉悟，划清资产阶级思想和无产阶级思想的界限。
    当时我想，这个厂过去没有经过民主改革，要把生产搞上去，首先要补好民主改革这一课，提高工人的阶级觉悟，划清资产阶级和无产阶级思想的界限。比如工人受了旧社会的影响，炼铜要请“太君”，烧纸钱。这个迷信活动不破除，群众的觉悟不提高，生产怎么能搞好？怎样才能使工人不信“太君”呢？这时，我想到毛主席的教导，不能用简单的命令去解决这个问题。毛主席说，菩萨要农民自己去丢，烈女祠、节孝坊要农民自己去摧毁，别人代庖是不对的。因此，我反复向群众进行宣传。老工人胡兴友说：“我在旧社会，到了年初一，就花钱烧香求老爷，想生活好些，但是年年求，生活反而一年不如一年。解放后，我不烧香，生活一天一天好了。”经过反复教育，工人的觉悟慢慢提高了。大家认识到翻身解放要跟共产党走，信“太君”没有用。
    在这个基础上，我又把厂里的女工调到炉子间去帮助工人装料、出铜，这样过了个把月，任务完成得很好。通过这件事，工人也认识到所谓妇女不能上炉灶，是旧社会的影响，不信这一套了。
    厂里几个资本家为了发展自己的势力，把工人分成河南帮、湖北帮、绍兴帮，分化工人的团结。当时，掌握实权的资本家是河南人，熔铝车间河南工人的福利待遇就特别高。别的资本家就煽动绍兴帮、湖北帮的工人抓河南工人的小辫子，生产上互不协作，工人动不动就打架。我想要解决这个问题，首先要从根本上提高工人的觉悟，我一方面向群众宣传天下工人阶级是一家的道理，另一方面，做个别人的工作，特别是做重点人物的工作，启发他们回忆对比，揭露资本家的阴谋手段。这些同志的觉悟提高了，就开团结会，由他们现身说法。绍兴帮的工人说：过去我们认错了人，把自己的阶级兄弟当仇人，把资本家当亲人，上了资本家的当，现在老陈帮助我们提高认识，今后要加强团结，搞好生产。河南帮的工人也表示，要把不合理的福利待遇取消。后来工人们就把福利待遇逐步统一起来。接着，我又组织大家互相学习技术，开展生产竞赛，使工人之间的团结逐步加强。
    他是我们的阶级弟兄，他的思想落后，不能怪他，主要是我的工作没有做好。
    对一些思想比较落后的工人，我就耐心帮助他们提高觉悟。曹光聚同志是全厂闻名的大炮，最会吵架，我做报告时，他就在下面骂我，说我是卖狗皮膏药，叫工人不要听我的，还说再讲下去，要揍我一顿。我想这个人这样胡闹，送去劳动教育也够条件。后来我了解到他也是苦出身，从小失去父亲，河南闹灾荒时，流浪到上海，在旧社会吃尽了苦，冬天连棉被都没有。由于在旧社会无依无靠，得不到温暖，长成了坏脾气，动不动就骂人打架。我想，他是我们的阶级弟兄，他的思想落后，不能怪他，主要是我的工作没有做好。以后我就主动关心他的思想和生活。有一次，他生病在家休养，我访问他，他很紧张，担心厂里会把他开除。我安慰他，要他静心休养，还请了医生给他治病，又把工资送到他家里。经常和他谈谈革命的道理，对比新旧社会的不同。有一次，在谈话中触动了他的思想，他激动得哭了起来。说：“我在旧社会生了病就被资本家开除出厂，现在我生了病，干部这样关心我，我决不能对不起党。”他的病还未痊愈，就到厂里来上班。我们照顾他做轻便工作，他却拣重活做。我又不断向他进行教育，告诉他不光是要积极搞生产，而且还要树立为人民服务的思想。他就积极参加学习文化，看了许多革命书，下了决心要改掉坏脾气，跟上新形势，争取做个共产党员。从此以后，他有很大转变。不仅不同别人吵架，而且埋头苦干为大家做好事，每天早晨提前到厂里来把各车间的生产准备工作都做好，拣旧木料为大家做洗脸架子，用旧麻袋为各车间缝了挡风的门帘。还对别人做思想工作。群众说他前后完全变了两个人。后来，工人就选他当工会宣传委员。一九五九年入了党，现在已经是党支部副书记了。
    现在工人不再是做资本家的牛马了，工人翻身当主人，腰杆子要硬起来。
    还有一个被资本家压得不敢吭一声气的“老好人”，叫王新敬，他是个对什么人都不得罪的“老好人”。有一次，我主动同他谈谈家常，他很紧张，说：“你们开会的情况，我没有告诉资本家”。我看他很紧张，就没有再说下去。后来，我又不断接近他，才知道他在解放前穷得连老婆都养不起，解放后生活才慢慢翻了身。我对他说：“现在工人不再是做资本家的牛马了，工人翻身当主人，腰杆子要硬起来。”以后有什么会议就请他参加。本来，由于资本家用小恩小惠拉拢他，使他觉得资本家还不错，经过教育才逐步懂得了这是资本家的一种剥削手段，觉悟提高了，胆子也大了，敢于站起来揭发资本家的种种罪恶活动。他在生产上也表现很积极，处处爱厂如家。一九六○年他当选为上海市人民代表，几年来一直是五好工人。
    还有一个老工人叫程阿双，原来是在资本家家里当佣人，公私合营后，在厂里当炊事员。这个同志工作很积极，但觉悟不高，会象奉承资本家一样奉承我。后来，我经常向她讲革命故事，组织她参加读报组，请她参加厂里的各种会议，着重解决她低人一等的思想，启发她树立主人翁思想。她看到我们这样平等对待她，非常感动，她说：“多亏党教育了我，使我懂得了翻了身，要抬起头来做主人。”她并表示一定要把食堂办好。从此，她想各种办法了解工人的口味，改进伙食。她又积极学习政治和文化，很快提高了觉悟。一九五九年程阿双入了党。
    工人的觉悟提高了，眼睛擦亮了，资本家的罪恶活动就被揭露出来了，群众与他们进行了斗争。同时，党的力量也扩大了，先后发展了十四个党员，一九五八年我们成立了党支部。
    工人觉悟提高了，就要闹生产革命。
    工人觉悟提高后就要闹生产革命。我们这个“垃圾厂”，原来都是笨重的体力劳动，劳动强度很高。熔炼工人在一千多度高温的墩炉房里操作了半小时，就头昏脑胀，气喘心跳，非得躺在泥地上休息一下不可。淘铜工人在冬天双手泡在冷水里淘铜砂，寒彻骨髓，真是冷在手上，痛在心里。老工人胡兴友，祖辈三代是淘铜工。他说，“我们吃了几辈子的苦，再不能让下一代再吃这个苦了”。他坚决表示，一定要把落后的操作改成机械化。他和工人从兄弟厂搞来了一台报废的石磨，自己动手设计、改装，把碾碎淘铜搞成了机械化，效率提高了十几倍，节约了二十七个工人。
    淘铜工作改成机械化后，熔炼工序还是笨重的体力劳动，跟不上生产需要。我们又组织工人到上海冶炼厂参观，工人到厂里一看，机器都是大家伙。大家说：我们看了洋的，但是自己要搞土的，搞出自己用得上的炉灶。他们不会设计绘图，就用烂泥来捏模型。几十个人一起动手，一共捏了三十几只，大家一边讨论，一边改进，搞成了大家满意的土平炉模型，根据金属熔炼的温度不同，排成一条龙。火力低的地方炼铝，火力强的地方炼铜屑，最强的地方炼铜砂。烧开水的同志一看，要把烧开水炉灶也合在一起；炊事员同志也说，你们都“合作化”，我也不能单干，要求也捏一只炉灶加在旁边，利用炉火余热烧开水、烧饭。这样，一只炉子就可五用。模型出来后，有人说这种炉灶不行，有人说行。怎么办呢？我们开支委会讨论，把它肯定下来，决定自己动手砌土平炉。当时没有耐火砖，我们就到一些大厂去拣报废的耐火砖，干了三天三夜，终于把土平炉砌起来了。熔炼工序的产量从原来每天炼一吨提高到了十吨；过去要三十个人，现在只要十一个人就够了；煤耗也大大减少，过去熔一吨铜要一千多公斤，现在只要二百公斤；过去熔一吨铝要一千七百公斤，现在只要八十公斤。
    又有一次，我们搞技术革新需要一台喷煤粉机。同工人商量后，他们说：我们自己想办法把喷煤粉机搞出来。于是，根据本厂生产特点大家动手分开搞。有的搞进煤的部分，有的搞喷煤的部分。苦干了几天几夜我们搞好了一台土喷煤粉机，小巧灵活，效率很高。
    路走得对，一定要坚持走下去。
    我们不仅自力更生，大搞技术革新，改善了劳动条件，还主动找任务，扩大品种，满足国家建设需要。工人们说：过去我们在垃圾里淘出铜，但垃圾中还有其他宝，我们一定要把所有的宝都找出来。后来大家发现进厂的边脚废材料中还有硫酸铵，如果能够把这些硫酸铵提炼出来，就是支援农业的重要物资。但当时我们又没有这笔试制费，怎么办？大家就到兄弟厂去找来一些废旧材料，七拼八凑地搞起了一套土设备。最后还缺一只压力表，工人又想办法用一只洋泡泡（气球）来代替。压力大了，洋泡泡胀大了；压力小了，洋泡泡也缩小了，很灵光。大家说：洋泡泡比压力表还好。后来正式投入生产时，改用球胆代替压力表。这样，我们靠自己搞起来的土设备，提炼出了硫酸铵。
    一个宝找到了，大家的劲头更足了，又在垃圾里找到了锌。硫酸锌是发展人造纤维急需的物资，我们国家生产不能满足需要，如果能把它提炼出来，多好！开始，我们在试验提炼时，总是用火炼的办法，几次都不成功。在困难面前，我们就请参加过二万五千里长征的老干部来讲当时爬雪山、过草地克服困难的故事。大家听了，信心很足，说：前辈们为了革命流血牺牲，这才是真正的困难；我们现在要多动点脑筋，多流点汗，算得了什么！他们在长征时山里一条路走不通，就走水里一条路；我们现在回收锌，火里走不通，就走水里。于是，我们就到化工厂去参观、学习，试验用化学的方法把锌拿出来。没有试制费用，就用小煤球炉、面盆等进行试验，终于炼出了硫酸锌。但是这种硫酸锌的成本比较高，要一千多元一吨，而国家收购价格只有七百元。有的人怀疑说：“还是不要搞了吧！”我们就发动群众讨论，我们的路走得对不对？最后大家一致认为，路走得对，一定要坚持走下去。成本高，可以想办法降低。经过工人们大搞技术革新，现在我们厂每吨硫酸锌的成本已大大降低。
    我们厂提炼硫酸锌只有十个工人，用的都是土设备，去年就生产出了五百多吨，今年要在不增加人的条件下扩大到八百吨。生产硫酸锌的设备不够，工人们就到大厂的废旧设备、材料中去找。最近，我们在一个染料厂里找到一种废旧设备很合我们用，就请求他们给了我们。我们把它拼拼凑凑安装起来，就可以把硫酸锌的生产搞上去了。
    我们不是吃了老虎胆，而是学了毛泽东思想。
    钢铁厂的铝粉，是提高铸钢成材率的重要材料，上海不生产铝粉。炼钢厂用的铝粉都要从外地运来。而我们厂里有的是废铝。既然国家建设上需要，我们就要生产。生产铝粉的技术难掌握，容易发生燃烧、爆炸。有的人知道了这件事，就说：这些人真是吃了老虎胆。工人说：我们不是吃了老虎胆，而是学习了毛泽东思想。大家在战略上藐视困难，在战术上重视困难，认真地进行反复试验。我们小厂没有试验室，就借大厂的试验室试验。试验成功后，领导上要我们进行小批生产，给钢铁厂试用，我们又没有设备。工人说：把大厂试验室里的设备搬到厂里来搞小批生产。与对方一商量，他们大力支持，我们就把他们的设备搬到厂里，马达底脚都没有安装，就开始生产了。样品一出来，要货的单位非常多。上级就拨给我们十二万元，要我们新建一个铝粉车间。我们小厂从来没有拿到过这么多钱，有些人的头脑就热起来了，要造一个朝南的车间，朝东的仓库。我们让群众讨论如何使用这笔资金的问题。许多工人都说：国家急需的是铝粉，又不是漂亮的厂房。我们要把富日子当穷日子过，国家的钱一元要当二元用。按照这个精神，我们不搞新的厂房，凡是自己能够搞的设备都自己搞，结果只花了二万多元，就建成了。多下来的钱全部上交给国家。这样做，有的人说我们是傻瓜，但厂里的工人却批评我们：再精打细算一下，二万多元也用不了，只要几千元就行了。譬如，设备上要一台空气压缩机，因为时间急，就花了一万多元买了一台新的，如果买旧的就不用花这么多钱。我接受了工人的批评，老老实实地向工人作了检讨。
    后来，有一个科学研究单位需要一种质量很高的铝粉，也跑到我们这个小厂来要求协助。当时，我们搞出来的铝粉比较粗，离他们的要求很远。但是，当我们听了这个单位同志说这种铝粉的用途很大，国家正迫切需要时，都表示一定要把它生产出来。我们对这个科学研究单位的同志说：你们在旅馆里等着，我们立刻动手。他问我们要多少钱，我们说：不要钱。大家动了很多脑筋，在原有设备上作了一些改进，没有花什么钱，就把这种高质量的铝粉试制出来了。对方拿到这种铝粉很高兴，说要建议上级给我们投资。我们对他说：我们不要国家投资，你们以后有需要，尽管再来好了。
    几年来，我们在党中央和市委领导下，以阶级斗争为纲、坚持四个第一，突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装职工群众的头脑，人的精神面貌起了很大变化，工厂的生产面貌也发生了很大变化。一九五七年，劳动生产率每人每年是一万四千多元，一九六五年达到十二万元；上缴利润一九六五年达到了一百二十一万元，相当于我厂固定资产的六倍。（文中插题是本报编者加的）
