　　Four Months in Xiezhai Village
　　Du Xuming, Party Committee Cadre of Yanggu Commune, Qixian County, Henan

　　After reading the article "Jiao Yulu – A Model for County Party Secretaries," I was reminded of that stormy and turbulent 1952. In August of that year, Comrade Jiao Yulu came to Qixian County with the land reform review work team organized by the CPC Kaifeng Prefectural Committee. I also participated in the work team and lived and worked with Comrade Jiao Yulu in Xiezhai Village for more than four months.

　　Before the land reform review work team went to the countryside, it had several days of intensive study in the county. After the meeting, it was getting dark. Some of the other comrades and I thought: We must have a good rest tonight, we are going to the countryside tomorrow! Comrade Jiao Yulu said to everyone in a gentle voice: "Let's go now! Eighteen miles is not far, arriving early means we can start working early!" When he said this, our energy also came up, so we went to the township with Comrade Jiao Yulu, carrying our luggage in the dark. As soon as we arrived at the township, a few of us opened our quilts and went to sleep; however, Comrade Jiao Yulu immediately went to the township head and the township finance and grain personnel to discuss work together. When I woke up in the middle of the night, the three of them were still discussing! I felt very bad about it, but Comrade Jiao Yulu comforted me and said: "Young people are sleepy. Go to sleep quickly, get up early tomorrow to work." At dawn, when I got up, he had already walked around the village, filled a bucket with water for washing his face, and cleaned the floor of the house spotlessly.

　　In the four months or so in Xiezhai Village, I saw that he often carried the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" single-volume edition in his pocket. He studied during the day, studied at night, and studied whenever he had some free time. He would also study for a while after returning from meetings every night before going to sleep. That winter came particularly early that year, and the cold was even heavier at night. I was afraid that he would get cold, so I secretly took a few sorghum stalks from the home of an old poor peasant. Before I could light the fire, I was stopped by Lao Jiao, and he told me to apologize to the person the next day. In this bitterly cold winter, he never burned a single piece of firewood belonging to the masses.

　　At that time, Comrade Jiao Yulu was the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Prefectural Committee of the Youth League, and his food, clothing, and housing were very frugal. The cotton-padded clothes he wore were still a set of faded gray coarse cloth broken military uniform that had been issued years ago. The socks he wore on his feet were patched upon patched. The rough cloth broken quilt he used to cover himself was also very thin. At that time, the masses had just been allocated land and their lives were not yet prosperous, and they lacked firewood in the winter, so he rarely asked the masses to cook at night, mostly eating some cold steamed buns. As time went on, I saw that Comrade Jiao Yulu's body was becoming thinner, so I and several other comrades persuaded him to join the school's mess hall. He refused, always saying: "We are here to serve the people, not to eat and drink. The masses can live the life, and we can live it even better. The work team cannot be special, we must pay attention to the impact on the masses."

　　Comrade Jiao Yulu also paid great attention to cultivating successors for rural grassroots cadres. In the short four months of land reform review work, he cultivated and developed more than twenty Youth League members and cultivated several Party member candidates. He always patiently persuaded and educated comrades who had made mistakes, so that they could correct their mistakes and start anew. At that time, there was a Party member in the village who, due to his low awareness and unstable class position, had made a mistake, and had been given an administrative punishment of dismissal; however, some comrades still demanded that he be expelled from the Party. Comrade Jiao Yulu said: "Although this comrade has made a mistake, he has already been given an administrative punishment. Besides, he is also our class brother. The heavier the punishment, the more it is to educate him and save him. Now is a critical moment in the class struggle. Why not give him a chance to correct his mistakes and test him in the land reform review movement? Wouldn't that be better?" Under the persuasion of Comrade Jiao Yulu, his Party membership was retained. Later, this comrade corrected his mistakes, actively carried out the struggle against the enemy, and performed very well.

　　After the land reform review work was over, we separated. For ten years, I often missed this good comrade. In 1963, I went to Lankao on a business trip. One day, I suddenly heard someone shouting from behind: "Xiao Du, Xiao Du!" I turned around and looked, ah! It was Comrade Jiao Yulu! I rushed forward, grasped his hand tightly with both hands, and just shouted "Lao Jiao!" when he asked me: "Xiao Du, have you joined the Party yet?" I said: "I have not failed the expectations of the Party and you, I joined the Party in 1956." He was very happy to hear this, and then he said to me kindly: "You are already a Party member, you must work even better for the Party in the future, wholeheartedly for the people." Although we have not met since then, his words and deeds and what he said to me, I will always remember them in my heart!

　　在谢寨村的四个月
　　河南杞县阳堌公社党委干事　杜绪明
    读完了《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》这篇文章后，使我想起那暴风骤雨的一九五二年。那年八月，焦裕禄同志同中共开封地委组织的土改复查工作队来到杞县。我也参加了工作队，和焦裕禄同志一起住在谢寨村，工作了四个多月。
    土改复查工作队下乡以前，在县里紧张地学习了好几天。会议结束后，天快黑了。我和其它几个同志都想：今晚可得好好休息休息，明天要下乡了！焦裕禄同志却温和地对大家说：“咱们还是现在走吧！十八里路不算远，早到可以早做工作哩！”他这么一说，我们的劲头也来了，就和焦裕禄同志一起背着行李摸黑到了乡里。一到乡，我们几个打开被子就睡了；可是，焦裕禄同志却立刻去找乡长和乡财粮来一起研究工作。半夜我醒来时，他们三人还在商谈呢！我心里觉得很不是味儿，焦裕禄同志却安慰我说：“小伙子就好瞌睡。快点睡吧，明天早些起来工作。”天明了，当我起身时，他已绕村转了一圈，打好一桶洗脸水，还把屋内的地打扫得干干净净的。
    在谢寨村的四个多月中，我见他衣兜里经常装着毛主席著作单行本，白天学，晚上学，有点空就学，每天夜里开会回来，也要学一会才睡觉。那年冬天冷得特别早，夜里寒气更重。我怕冻坏了他，就偷偷到一位贫农老大爷家里拿了几棵秫秸回来。还没有点着火，就被老焦制止了，并叫我第二天向人家道了歉。在这严寒的数九腊月天，他没有烤过群众一根柴禾。
    当时焦裕禄同志是青年团地委宣传部部长，他的衣食住都很俭朴。他穿的一身棉衣，还是早年发的一套褪了色的灰粗布破军装。脚上穿的一双袜子，补钉连补钉。盖的一条粗布破被子，也薄得很。当时，群众才分到土地，生活还不太富裕，冬天又缺烧柴，因此晚上他很少叫群众做饭，多是吃点凉馍。天长日久，我看到焦裕禄同志的身体消瘦下来，就和别的几个同志劝他搭学校的伙。他不肯，总是说：“我们是来为人民服务的，不是为了吃喝来的。群众能过的日子，我们更能过。工作队不能特殊，要注意群众影响。”
    焦裕禄同志还很注意培养农村基层干部的接班人。在短短四个月的土改复查工作中，培养发展了二十多名团员，培养了好几个党员对象。他对犯了错误的同志总是耐心说服教育，使他们能改正错误，重新做人。当时，村里有个党员因觉悟不高，阶级立场不稳，犯了错误，行政上已给了他撤职处分；可是有些同志还要求开除他的党籍。焦裕禄同志却说：“这位同志虽然犯了错误，行政上已给他处分了。再说，他也是咱们的阶级弟兄，处分再重也是为了教育他挽救他。现在正是阶级斗争的紧要关头，不如给他一个改正错误的机会，在土改复查运动中考验他。不更好吗？”在焦裕禄同志的说服下，保留了他的党籍。后来，这位同志改正了错误，积极开展对敌斗争，表现很好。
    土改复查工作结束后，我们分开了。十年来，我时常思念这位好同志。一九六三年，我出差到兰考。有一天，忽然听到背后有人喊：“小杜，小杜！”我转身一看，啊！是焦裕禄同志！我赶上前去，双手紧紧握住他的手，刚喊了声“老焦！”他就问我：“小杜，入党了吗？”我说：“没辜负党和你的期望，一九五六年就入了党。”他听了很高兴，随后，又亲切地对我说：“你已经是个党员啦，今后要更好地为党工作，一心一意为人民。”虽然从那以后，我们就没有再见面了，但是他的言行和他对我说的话，我却永远记在心头！
