    The Xinxiang County Committee convened a county committee meeting on the afternoon of the 7th to discuss the study of Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, and at the same time instructed county-level organs to stop working in the afternoon to study articles and the *People's Daily* editorial. The county committee members who participated in the discussion were very excited. Everyone believed that Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit for the people and for the revolution, and his leadership style and methods, set a brilliant example for the county's leading cadres, especially the county party secretaries. The following are excerpts from the speeches of the county party secretary and the county head:
    County Party Secretary Wang Xingyun said:
    After reading Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds and the *People's Daily* editorial, there are many things I want to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu. But I keep thinking about this question: Why, under relatively superior natural conditions, do we become complacent and stop moving forward after achieving some results and making minor reforms? In the final analysis, we lack Comrade Jiao Yulu's thorough revolutionary spirit.
    We also conduct investigations and stay at selected points, but not in the same way as Comrade Jiao Yulu, who conducted arduous and meticulous investigations and research to understand natural laws, recognize nature, and transform nature. We have many "probably" and "almost" things in our minds that are causing trouble. We issue instructions and make plans after seeing a little, hearing a little, and having a little feeling. We know something about the situation in the county, but not specifically. We know some of the masses' demands and calls, but not specifically. As a result, when we lead the production struggle, we are like a yangko dance, swaying and uncertain. Although production is improving step by step, the leadership is relatively passive, the price paid is high, and the time spent is long. We cannot learn and apply Mao Zedong's thought in a lively way like Comrade Jiao Yulu and consciously throw ourselves into battle.
    County Head Yuan Xiutian said:
    The key to learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu lies in ideological revolutionization. Because investigation and research, and understanding and grasping objective laws, involve fighting against our own subjectivism, desire for comfort and enjoyment, and other thoughts. This is also a revolution. After Comrade Jiao Yulu arrived in Lankao, he did not issue orders first, but immediately went down to investigate and research. He braved the wind and rain to investigate wind gaps and explore water currents. Without the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, this would not be possible.

    条件比兰考好，为什么工作比兰考差？
    新乡县委七日下午召开县委会议，座谈讨论学习焦裕禄同志事迹，并同时指示县级机关下午停止办公，学习文章和《人民日报》社论。参加座谈会的县委委员都很激动，大家认为焦裕禄同志为人民、为革命的精神，和他的领导作风和方法为县的领导干部、特别是县委书记树立了光辉的榜样。现将县委书记和县长的发言摘要发表如下：
    县委书记王兴云同志说：
    读了焦裕禄同志的事迹和《人民日报》社论，我要向焦裕禄同志学习的东西很多。但我总在想这个问题，为什么我们在比较优越的自然条件下，有了一点成绩，有了微小的改革，就沾沾自喜，裹足不前？归根到底，是我们缺乏焦裕禄同志的那种彻底革命精神。
    我们也调查，也蹲点，但不是象焦裕禄同志那样进行艰苦细致的调查研究，摸清自然规律，认识自然，改造自然。我们脑子里有很多“大概”和“差不多”的东西在作怪。看到一点，听到一点，有一点感觉，就发指示，订规划。对全县的情况也了解也不大了解，对群众的要求和呼声也知道一些，但不具体，结果，我们领导生产斗争时，象扭秧歌，摇摆不定。生产虽然也步步提高，但领导比较被动，付出的代价高，用的时间长，不能象焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席的思想，自觉地投入战斗。
    县长袁秀田同志说：
    学习焦裕禄同志，关键在于思想革命化。因为调查研究，认识掌握客观规律，是要同自己的主观主义，贪图安逸、享乐等思想进行斗争，这也是一场革命。焦裕禄同志到兰考后没有先发号施令，而是立即下去调查研究，他在风里雨里，查风口，探水流，没有全心全意为人民服务的精神，这是做不到的。
