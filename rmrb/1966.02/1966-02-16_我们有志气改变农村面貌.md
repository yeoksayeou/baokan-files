    We Aspire to Change the Face of the Countryside
    I have settled down as a commune member in the Sixth Production Team of the Shizi Brigade of the Mimu Commune in the Qingbaijiang District of Chengdu City for more than two years. Under the leadership of the Party, and together with all the members of the team, through arduous struggle, we have transformed our original backward production team into an advanced production team; and I have also been tempered and grown in this process. Five days before the Spring Festival, I became a glorious probationary member of the Communist Party of China.
    Two years of revolutionary practice have made me deeply realize that educated youth going to the countryside must carry forward the fearless spirit of the proletariat, and in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, put "dare" first, transform themselves, transform the world, in order to contribute their strength to the socialist new countryside.
    In the winter of 1963, the situation of the Sixth Production Team at that time was that the leadership was weak, the production system was unsound, the financial accounts were relatively chaotic, and the production was relatively backward. Under such circumstances, whether I dared to face the difficulties and fight was a serious test for me. After repeated ideological struggles, I studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and determined to overcome all difficulties. In particular, hearing the poor and lower-middle peasants say that with the leadership of the Party, we have the ambition to change the face of the production team, further increased my confidence.
    In May 1964, I was elected as the accountant of the production team, but I was afraid to take on the responsibility. But thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, I felt that I should take over the burden. The poor and lower-middle peasants encouraged me and said: "We trust you, be bold and do it, and come to us if you have any difficulties." I felt that with Chairman Mao's guidance and the trust of the poor and lower-middle peasants, my thinking became firm, and I had more ideas. I worked during the day and kept accounts at night; I didn't know how to use an abacus, so I learned as I went. In this way, while familiarizing myself with accounting business, I cleared up the accounts, improved the financial system, and ensured that cash, work points, and investments were cleared daily and monthly, and announced to the poor and lower-middle peasants in a timely manner. After a period of effort, the poor and lower-middle peasants were very satisfied, and they said: "With you in charge of the accounts, the stone in our hearts has been lifted."
    In order to further seize increased production, I and several young people, old peasants, and cadres formed a scientific experiment group, and promoted new farming techniques and improved varieties, so that the yield of rice, wheat and total output in the past two years have more than doubled, and the income of the members has increased more than doubled. In June 1965, it was rated as an advanced production team in the district, and I was also rated as an advanced producer in the district in the autumn of this year.

    我们有志气改变农村面貌
    我到成都市清白江区弥牟公社狮子大队第六生产队落户当社员，已经两年多了。在党的领导下，我和全队社员一道，经过艰苦奋斗，把我们原来的一个后进生产队改变成了一个先进生产队；而我也在这个过程中得到锻炼和成长。春节前五天，我成为一个光荣的中国共产党预备党员。
    两年来的革命实践，使我深深地体会到，下乡知识青年必须发扬无产阶级的大无畏精神，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，“敢”字当头，改造自己，改造世界，才能为社会主义新农村贡献出自己的力量。
    一九六三年冬，第六生产队当时的状况是，领导力量较弱，生产制度不健全，财经账目比较混乱，生产较为落后。在这种情况下，我敢不敢迎着困难去斗争，这对我是个严重考验。经过反复的思想斗争，学习了《愚公移山》，决心排除万难。特别是听到贫下中农社员说，有党的领导，我们有志气改变生产队的面貌，就更使我增加了信心。
    一九六四年五月，我被选为生产队会计，当时不敢承担。但想起毛主席的教导，感到应该把担子接过来。贫下中农鼓励我说：“我们信得过你，大胆干，有困难找我们。”我感到有毛主席的指导，有贫下中农的信任，思想坚定了，办法也多了。我白天劳动，晚上记账；不会打算盘，我就边做边学。就这样，一边熟悉会计业务，一边清理账目，健全了财经制度，作到现金、工分、投资日清月结，及时向贫下中农公布。经过一段努力之后，贫下中农很满意，他们说：“有你管账，我们心头的石头就落地了。”
    为了进一步夺取增产，我和几个青年、老农和干部组成了科学试验小组，推行了新的耕作技术和良种，使两年来的水稻、小麦和总产量都增加了一倍以上，社员收入增加了两倍以上。一九六五年六月被评为区先进生产队，我也在这一年秋被评为区先进生产者。
