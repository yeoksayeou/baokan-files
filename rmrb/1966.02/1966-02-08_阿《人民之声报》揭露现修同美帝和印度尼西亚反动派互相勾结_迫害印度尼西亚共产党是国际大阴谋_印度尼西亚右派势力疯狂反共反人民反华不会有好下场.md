    Tirana, February 7th (Xinhua) – The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published a commentary on the 5th, condemning the Indonesian right-wing forces for engaging in rampant anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-China terror activities.

    The commentary stated, "The development of the grave tragic events in Indonesia over the past four months, Nasution's arrogant statements, and the Special Military Tribunal's preparation to try Indonesian communists and other patriots further clearly expose the sinister conspiracy meticulously planned by Indonesian reactionaries with the encouragement and instigation of U.S. imperialism. The purpose of this conspiracy is clear: to lead Indonesia away from the path of safeguarding and consolidating national independence, away from the policy of opposing imperialism and colonialism, to establish a fascist reign of terror, to open the door for foreign monopoly capital, and to place the colonialist yoke around the necks of the Indonesian people."

    The commentary pointed out, "To achieve these sinister goals, the Indonesian reactionaries and imperialists have directed their main attack at the long-tested vanguard and staunch defender of the Indonesian people's interests, the Indonesian Communist Party. To the reactionaries, to the imperialists and their friends, the Indonesian Communist Party has become a powerful obstacle hindering the realization of anti-people and anti-national plans.

      "Therefore, the Indonesian right-wing forces clamor frantically against Indonesian communists and other progressive democratic organizations. They have launched and continue to wage savage terror activities in order to thoroughly embark on the path of betrayal and undermine the country's national independence. Their evil actions have crossed all boundaries. Thousands of communists and progressives have been brutally murdered, and tens of thousands of communists and progressives have been thrown into prisons and concentration camps. They have trampled on the most basic human rights. Indonesian reactionaries continue bloody atrocities against overseas Chinese in Indonesia."

    The commentary stated, "Millions of progressive and freedom-loving people with consciences around the world are outraged by the Indonesian reactionaries' crimes against the outstanding sons and daughters of the Indonesian people. The Albanian people, staunch fighters against imperialism and reactionaries of all countries, express profound anger and strong protest against the savage terror wave that continues to spread madly in Indonesia against communists and other democratic forces. The Albanian working class, youth, and women, in various rallies, have voiced their support for the Indonesian people and opposition to the vile crimes, mass arrests, and fascist actions orchestrated by the Indonesian reactionaries."

    The commentary stated, "Only the enemies of people's freedom and independence, progress and peace in all countries, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, are happy and dancing with joy. They are happy because they are the instigators who directed the tragedy of betraying the Indonesian people. They are happy because it will be easy to realize their plans and conspiracies to turn Indonesia into a U.S. base of aggression against the liberation movements of the Asian peoples and to expand the Pentagon's 'circle of fire' in this region of the world."

    The commentary pointed out, "While the Indonesian democratic forces, especially the Indonesian Communist Party, are under the mad persecution of the reactionaries and are in a critical moment, the traitorous Khrushchev revisionists continue to pursue a hypocritical stance. Although they also said a word or two against the fascist terror activities of the reactionaries, they are actually involved in the conspiracy against the Indonesian Communist Party. The Khrushchev revisionists attack the Indonesian Communist Party together with the reactionaries, encouraging and supporting this attack together with U.S. imperialism, and making wild accusations against the Indonesian Communist Party, accusing it of being 'sectarian', 'dogmatic', etc. On the other hand, the traitorous Tito clique, U.S. imperialism's long-tested agent, also called on the Indonesian reactionaries to continue their unbridled attacks on the Communist Party and progressive democratic forces. Khrushchev and Tito revisionists have long united to fight to undermine and eliminate the Indonesian Communist Party because the Indonesian Communist Party has always stood on a healthy position against imperialism and revisionism. The parallel and unswerving hostile actions of reactionaries, imperialists, and revisionists are part of the international imperialist-revisionist conspiracy against the freedom of peoples of all countries."

    The commentary concluded, "The Indonesian reactionaries, supported by U.S. imperialism, can go further on their path of betrayal, continue to arrest, interrogate, and slaughter, but they can never stifle the national feelings and the desire for independence and social progress that are deeply rooted in the hearts of millions of Indonesian workers and peasants. No matter how serious the situation may be, the Indonesian people will decide their own destiny. Life itself has shown that no matter how reactionaries and fascists struggle, the same fate that befell their predecessors awaits them."

    阿《人民之声报》揭露现修同美帝和印度尼西亚反动派互相勾结
    迫害印度尼西亚共产党是国际大阴谋
    印度尼西亚右派势力疯狂反共反人民反华不会有好下场
    新华社地拉那七日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》五日发表评论，谴责印度尼西亚右派势力大搞反共、反人民和反华的恐怖活动。
    评论说，“四个月来印度尼西亚沉重悲剧事件的发展，纳苏蒂安狂妄的声明，特别军事法庭准备审判印度尼西亚共产党人和其他爱国者，进一步清楚地暴露了印度尼西亚反动派在美帝国主义鼓励、怂恿下精心策划的罪恶阴谋。这个阴谋的目的是清楚的，这就是使印度尼西亚离开维护和巩固民族独立的道路，离开反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义政策，建立法西斯恐怖制度，为外国垄断资本打开方便之门，以便把殖民主义的枷锁套到印度尼西亚人民的脖子上”。
    评论指出，“为了实现这些罪恶目的，印度尼西亚反动派和帝国主义者把主要打击的矛头指向久经考验的先锋队和保卫印度尼西亚人民利益的坚定战士印度尼西亚共产党。对反动派、对帝国主义及其朋友来说，印度尼西亚共产党已经成为阻碍实现反人民和反民族计划的强大障碍。
      “因此，印度尼西亚右派势力疯狂地叫嚣反对印度尼西亚共产党人和其他进步的民主组织。他们掀起了野蛮的恐怖活动并正在继续下去，以便彻底走向背叛的道路，破坏本国的民族独立。他们的罪恶行动已超越了界限。成千名共产党员和进步人士被野蛮杀害，数万名共产党人和进步人士被投入监狱和集中营。他们蹂躏了人类最起码的权利。印度尼西亚反动派还对在印度尼西亚的华侨继续进行血腥的兽行。”
    评论说，“世界上千百万有良心的进步的和爱好自由的人民对印度尼西亚反动派反对印度尼西亚人民优秀儿女的罪行感到愤怒。反对帝国主义和反对各国反动派的坚定战士的阿尔巴尼亚人民，对继续在印度尼西亚疯狂蔓延的反对共产党人和其他民主力量的野蛮恐怖浪潮表示深刻的愤怒和强烈的抗议。阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级、青年、妇女在各种集会上，发出了支持印度尼西亚人民、反对印度尼西亚反动派策划的卑鄙罪行、大规模逮捕和法西斯行动的呼声”。
    评论说，“只有各国人民自由和独立、进步与和平的敌人美帝国主义及其走狗感到高兴和手舞足蹈。他们高兴，因为他们是导演出卖印度尼西亚人民的悲剧的唆使者。他们高兴，因为这样就会轻而易举地实现他们为使印度尼西亚变为美国反对亚洲各国人民解放运动的侵略基地、扩大五角大楼在世界这一地区的‘火力圈’的计划和阴谋”。
    评论指出，“当印度尼西亚民主力量、首先是印度尼西亚共产党人处于反动派的疯狂迫害并正处在严重时刻的时候，叛徒赫鲁晓夫修正主义者却继续奉行伪君子的立场，尽管他们也说了一句半句反对反动派法西斯恐怖活动的话，但实际上是参与了反对印度尼西亚共产党的阴谋。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者与反动派一起攻击印度尼西亚共产党，与美帝国主义一起怂恿和支持这一攻击，对印度尼西亚共产党大放厥词，指责印度尼西亚共产党是‘宗派主义’、‘教条主义’等。另一方面，美帝国主义考验已久的代理人叛徒铁托集团也呼吁印度尼西亚反动派继续肆无忌惮的攻击共产党和进步的民主力量。赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义者早就联合起来为破坏和消灭印度尼西亚共产党而斗争，因为印度尼西亚共产党一直站在反对帝国主义和修正主义的健康立场上。反动派、帝国主义者和修正主义者并行不悖的敌对行动是帝国主义—修正主义在国际范围内反对各国人民自由的阴谋的组成部分”。
    评论最后说，“得到美帝国主义支持的印度尼西亚反动派可以在其背叛道路上进一步走下去，可以继续逮捕、审讯和屠杀，但是他们永远也不能够扼杀深深植根于千百万印度尼西亚工人和农民心中的民族感情、争取独立和社会进步的愿望。不管出现的形势多么严重，印度尼西亚人民将会自己决定自己的命运。生活本身已经表明，无论反动派和法西斯主义者如何挣扎，等待着他们的是他们前人遭到的同样命运”。
