    The people of Honolulu used anti-war demonstrations to "welcome" Johnson's arrival. The signs they held read: "Stop Johnson's War!" "Murderer, Go Home!"
    According to American news agencies, one of the reasons Johnson wanted to go to Honolulu himself was to escape the increasingly strong accusations in Congress against his policy of aggression in Vietnam. However, Honolulu is not a "utopia" for people like Johnson. What awaits them there are even stronger accusations and angry protests from the people.
    Johnson and his ilk have repeatedly boasted that the U.S. policy of aggression in Vietnam is "widely supported" at home and abroad. But the facts have proven just how isolated the American aggressors are! Not only are demonstrations and protests against the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam surging around the world, but the people's anti-war struggle is also surging at home in the United States. Whether Johnson and his ilk stay in the capital Washington or run to the overseas territory of Honolulu, they cannot escape the protests and condemnations of the people. They are truly like rats running across the street, with everyone shouting to beat them.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "If the American monopoly capitalist groups persist in pursuing its policies of aggression and war, it is bound to be one day be sentenced to death by hanging by the people of the world." Now, American imperialism has put the noose around its own neck, and handed the other end of the noose to the people of all countries, and also to the American people. The surging tide of the American people's struggle against their own imperialism and the torrent of the world's anti-American struggle are converging, which presages that the day when American imperialism will be sentenced to death by hanging by the American people and the people of the world is not far off!

### 绞刑日近

    绞刑日近
    檀香山人民用反战示威来“欢迎”约翰逊的到来。他们举的标语牌上写道：“停止约翰逊战争！”“杀人犯滚回去！”
    据美国通讯社报道，约翰逊之所以要亲自去檀香山，原因之一是要想逃避议会中对他的侵越政策的日益强烈的指责。可是，檀香山对于约翰逊之流说来也并非“世外桃源”，在那里等待着他们的却是来自人民的更加强烈的指责和愤怒的抗议。
    约翰逊之流曾经一再吹嘘，美国的侵越政策在美国国内外是“受到广泛支持的”。而事实却证明了，美国侵略者的处境是何等孤立！不仅在世界各地反对美国侵越战争的示威抗议风起云涌，而且在美国国内人民反战斗争也是怒潮澎湃。约翰逊之流不论是呆在首都华盛顿还是跑到海外领土檀香山，在哪里也躲不过人民的抗议和谴责。真是老鼠过街，人人喊打。
    毛泽东同志曾经指出：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。”现在，美帝国主义已把绞索套在自己的脖子上，而把绞索的另一端交给了各国人民，也交给了美国人民。美国人民反对本国帝国主义的斗争怒潮和世界人民反美斗争的洪流正在汇合起来，这预示着，美帝国主义被美国人民和全世界人民处以绞刑的日子已为期不远了！
