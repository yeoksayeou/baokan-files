    My surname is Cai, and my given name is Xiaohu. I joined the army in 1963 and was transferred to the company headquarters as a communication员 two years ago. The company commander often says that I have many advantages, but my shortcomings are also prominent. The main shortcoming is that my mouth lacks a sentry post, especially when encountering reporters or members of the cultural troupe, I always want to contribute some material. I am always a little uncomfortable with the company commander's criticism. What's wrong with contributing some material to reporters? Of course, contributing material must be based on facts. If it's nonsense or distorts the facts, the seriousness is significant. But the material I contribute is 100% true and reliable; it's all based on my observations and experiences, and I speak because I am moved. So why does the company commander still criticize me? There's a little background here: the main character of the material I contribute is almost always the company commander. Our company commander is a modest man who hates me telling others about his characteristics. However, his actions genuinely move me, and if I don't tell others about them, my heart feels swollen and uncomfortable. For example, something recently happened again, and I want to tell everyone to listen and judge whether it should be told or not.
    One afternoon, a staff officer from the regiment headquarters came to inquire about the throwing scores of the entire company. This staff officer had visited other companies before coming to our company, so he told our company commander the scores of the other companies. The company commander compared those scores with ours and suddenly frowned, not speaking for a long time. Was our company's score worse than the other companies? No, our company's score had reached a maximum of 51.6 meters and a minimum of 50.3 meters, which could be said to be a leading first compared to other companies. So why did he frown? This is precisely where our company commander's nobility lies. He was thinking that whether it was 51.6 meters or 50.3 meters, those were the scores from before the field training. Although we insisted on daily practice during the field training of more than a month, due to the limitations of the environment and the field, we practiced shooting more and throwing less. After returning from the field training, we went to support the fraternal companies in construction, and we only just returned yesterday. We haven't practiced throwing enough either. In this case, it is very likely that the throwing score will decrease. If he still reported the original score, he would feel dishonest. Therefore, he obtained the staff officer's consent and discussed with the political instructor, using the afternoon's drill time to universally re-measure one班 after another. Whatever the score was this time, that is what would be reported.
    Whenever there is a throwing test, my task as a communication员 is to register the scores together with the clerk. The artillery platoon threw first, and the scores were amazing. As I registered, I was happy. If they continued to throw like this, the average score of the entire company might even exceed 51.6 meters! After the artillery platoon finished throwing, the company headquarters and kitchen staff threw, and then the tests were conducted in the order of 班 and platoon. Since the scores of the company headquarters and kitchen staff were slightly worse, and the second platoon had two throws that landed outside the line, by the time the eighth班 had finished throwing, the average score of the entire company was 49.7 meters! At this moment, my heart was pounding! Oh my god, with only the ninth班 left, if the ninth班 could throw at the level of the artillery platoon, there was still hope for raising the average score of the entire company. If the ninth班 was not up to the task, then, the average score of the entire company would fall below the 50-meter record.
    The ninth班长 came with the ninth班.
    I thought that at this crucial moment, the company commander would definitely do some motivational work for the ninth班, so that they could give full play to their soaring enthusiasm, create miracles, and ensure that our company's throwing score would never fall below the 50-meter record. However, after the ninth班长 reported to him, he said only one word impassively: "Throw!" I muttered to myself: This company commander, he always emphasizes political prominence in peacetime. No matter what he does, he always strives for meticulousness and never takes anything lightly. He often says: "Cultivating a meticulous style allows for correct and decisive judgment of the situation in battle!" Because of this, I have even praised him to others, saying that no matter what he does, he always has the two words "combat readiness" in his mind. But why is he reversing his usual behavior at this crucial moment? Just as I was thinking this, I heard the voice of the grenade thrower: "55——" Ho! This "55" lifted my spirits. If they throw like this, there's a chance! At this moment, every jump and every posture of the thrower was connected to my flesh and blood; every number from the reporter's mouth struck my heart. My mood was like listening to the live broadcast of an international table tennis match, as nervous as it could be. "53" "49" "58.8"... Ah! With effort, two more throws above 60 meters and we'll pass! No, no need to be nervous, Zhou Zhifu, the famous throwing expert of the whole regiment, hasn't thrown yet! As long as he exerts a little effort, he'll throw at least 70 meters. Then the problem will be completely and thoroughly solved! However, after Zhang Jinquan threw a 49.5-meter, the ninth班长 gave the command to line up and reported to the company commander: "Throwing is complete!" Only then did I look carefully and realized that Zhou Zhifu was not there! I whispered to the clerk: "Where is Zhou Zhifu?" Who knew that the clerk's mood was more anxious than mine, and he was already calculating the average. He said, not answering my question: "Oh no! The average score is now 49.93, just 0.07 short, not above the 50 mark!" 0.07! 0.07 per person, then the entire company needs 18.4 meters! Sigh! If Zhou Zhifu was present, he only needed to throw 68.4 meters to solve the problem! But why didn't he come? I couldn't help but ask the ninth班长. The ninth班长 said: "He asked for leave to go to the market to buy a copy of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Second Edition!" I said: "Doesn't he already have one? Why is he buying another one?" The ninth班长 said: "He wants to buy another copy to send to his younger brother." I sighed with great regret and said: "If he were here, the average score wouldn't be 49.93!" The ninth班长 immediately asked me: "What, is the average score of the entire company not enough 50?" I said: "That's right, it's just 0.07 short!" The ninth班长 also stamped his foot and said: "Oh dear, if he could come back now!" I said: "Yes! We have to rely on him to raise the score!" At this time, someone suddenly said: "When the battle starts, are you just going to rely on one Zhou Zhifu!" I looked up and saw: Ah! It was the company commander. He had heard everything we said. I said: "Knowing it would be 49.93, we might as well have reported the original score!" The company commander said seriously: "We can't throw above 50 meters now. Wouldn't it be deceiving the superiors to report like that!" Then he said: "Didn't Chairman Mao say that everyone should reflect the situation truthfully? Since Chairman Mao said that, we have to do it that way." I said: "A month ago, we threw 51.6, and that was the actual situation!" The company commander said: "A month ago was a month ago, and now is now. Suppose when the battle starts, can the leaders use us based on our previous situation? Xiaohu! Don't just see this as a number! This number represents our combat power. When the battle starts, the leaders will use the troops based on the actual combat capability!"
    At this moment, someone waved in the distance, shouting "Zhou Zhifu, Zhou Zhifu——" I followed the direction of his waving and saw someone running towards us. Getting closer, hey! It was really Zhou Zhifu! He came to attention, panting heavily, saluting the company commander and reporting: "Ninth班 soldier Zhou Zhifu, returning from outside!" I was about to say: "You've come back just in time. Only you, the throwing expert, haven't thrown in this throwing test..." Before I could speak, the ninth班长 said loudly. However, the company commander unhurriedly took out his half-length towel, handed it to Zhou Zhifu, and said: "Look at you, your clothes are soaked with sweat! Wipe off the sweat first." Zhou Zhifu took the towel, wiped his sweat, and asked: "Is there a throwing test today?" The ninth班长 immediately said: "Of course. The score of our company depends on you to raise it!" Zhou Zhifu handed the towel back to the company commander, and said with a simple smile: "I'll do my best to throw!" As he spoke, he picked up the practice grenade on the ground. The company commander stopped him, saying: "Wait, if you're tired, you don't have to throw!" My heart thumped, oh my god, whether he throws or not is related to the entire company's "50 mark"! Although we oppose the idea of "one shot, one grenade determines everything," at this crucial moment, I can't control my emotions! I was about to make a suggestion to the company commander, but Zhou Zhifu slowly opened his mouth, "Heh heh. Don't you often say that when the real battle starts, rushing up the mountain, without even breathing and without the sweat drying, you have to fight the enemy to the death?" The company commander then said: "Okay! Then you throw!"
    Ha! With this, our entire company's average of 50 meters is guaranteed!
    Zhou Zhifu unhurriedly raised his heels, jumped a few times, and then swung his arms, back and forth, a few circles. Then, he retreated to about five meters behind the throwing line, bent down and gently wiped his right hand on the sandy soil, and then grasped the wooden handle of the grenade. From these few actions, you could tell that he was an experienced grenade thrower. Look: He bent his left leg, pushed his right leg back, leaned his chest slightly forward, swayed his arm, and then ran quickly. When he was about to reach the throwing line, he took a small step, stretched his right arm back, leaned his body slightly back, "Swish"! The grenade was thrown! The grenade, like a rocket, made a "whoosh" sound, overcoming the obstruction of the air, and flew forward fiercely, flew... until it "thumped" on the ground, raising a cloud of yellow smoke, I nervously waited for the melodious and high-pitched voice of the reporter.
      "71.3——"
    "Good!" I was so happy that I almost jumped up. With this, all the problems were solved!
    In the blink of an eye, he threw the second grenade out. I thought that he might create a higher record this time. But the reporter reported weakly: "62.4".
    What's going on? Just as I was wondering, the third grenade also landed. Who knew that this third one was even worse, only throwing 58 meters. Sigh! It was lucky that the first one was so good. Because according to the regulations, each person throws three times during the test, and the farthest one is used as the official score. In this way, 71.3 still raised the score of the entire company to above 50 meters!
    The reporter announced: "Farthest throw, 71.3."
    Before he announced it, the clerk and I had already registered it.
    However, at this crucial moment, Zhou Zhifu said: "No, my farthest throw was 62.4." Although his words were not loud, they were like a thunderbolt, making my ears buzz. Obviously, the farthest throw was 71.3, so why did he insist on saying it was 62.4? You know, this 71.3 and 62.4 are related to whether the score of our entire company can average above 50 meters! It seemed that the ninth班长's mood was similar to mine. He hurriedly said: "Obviously it's 71.3!" Zhou Zhifu still unhurriedly said: "When I threw the first grenade, I stepped on the line!" The ninth班长 said in surprise: "Stepped on the line? I didn't see you step on the line!" Zhou Zhifu said firmly: "I did step on the line." The ninth班长 turned red and said to the company commander: "Company commander! Look at this..." The company commander squatted down as if he wasn't worried and carefully checked inside and outside the line. After a while, he suddenly stood up, firmly grasped Zhou Zhifu's hand, and said loudly: "Good comrade, you did the right thing!" The ninth班长 stuttered in astonishment, saying: "But..." The company commander said: "But what? Comrade Zhou Zhifu's spirit is much better than 71.3!" Then he turned to me and said: "Tell the duty platoon leader to assemble the whole company!"
    To be honest, I was holding back a bellyful of opinions about the company commander's approach. Alas, to make the problem clear, I'll simply ramble a bit and talk about his experiences and performance since joining the army. His surname is Shi, his given name is Shi Renlong, and he just turned twenty-five this year. He joined the army in 1959 and became the company commander at the end of last year. He is of medium height, neither fat nor thin, and with a pair of big, dark, and bright eyes, he looks even more energetic. Also during marching in formation, when he shouts the command, the steps are especially neat, and the spirit is particularly vigorous! Everyone says that he is a daring general. In his first year in the army, he became a special marksman. During the thousand-mile field training, he had eighteen blisters on his feet, but he insisted on not falling behind. When he became a squad leader, he created a "Four Goods" squad with the entire squad. Whether it was ideology, training, style, or life, everything was outstanding and everything was excellent. The military leaders praised him repeatedly at the conference. Look, the row of casuarina trees on the left side of the barracks was planted by him, one by one, to block the wind and sand; the wooden horse on the drill ground, patched and patched, was stitched up by him, stitch by stitch. Especially the stone steps leading to the toilet were built by him the day after he was promoted to platoon leader, leading everyone with his shirt off. At that time, some people joked to him: "Hey! Still taking off your shirt and working after becoming a cadre?" He immediately said: "What about being a cadre? We become cadres to take over, not to take over an official position! The more we become cadres, the more we must carry forward the old traditions." He is always like this, silently burying himself in work. He attributes all the achievements to the Party branch and all the comrades; when there are shortcomings, he takes the lead in making self-criticism. Anyway, he carries two words in his heart: "Revolution"! When these two words "Revolution" are implemented in his work, it is "Combat Readiness". To do a good job in combat readiness, the breakthrough he chose was to do a good job in people's ideological work. Even though he is a military cadre, he does ideological work like a girl embroidering flowers, patiently and meticulously. He explains everything reasonably and convincingly, making people convinced. In August, he led the ninth班 to participate in the shooting competition in the regiment and got a third place in the overall score. On the way back, Zhou Zhifu whispered to the ninth班长: "Today, if we hadn't been shooting at the fifth target platform, we would have been guaranteed to get first place." The ninth班长 said: "Yes! The target of the fifth target is too unclear, set tightly next to a small pine tree, plus the sun is reflecting, it's simply unclear." Zhou Zhifu said: "Anyway, we are a little disadvantaged!" Our company commander heard Zhou Zhifu's words and kept them in his heart. After unloading the equipment and washing his face, he immediately found him for an individual talk. He didn't mention today's shooting, but first gave a topic: "What is the shooting competition for?" Zhou Zhifu replied fluently: "To test our training results!" The company commander asked again: "What is training for?" Zhou Zhifu said: "To eliminate the enemy!" The company commander asked again: "If the enemy is hiding next to a small pine tree on the battlefield, do you want to eliminate him?" Zhou Zhifu said: "Needless to say, even if he is hiding in a rabbit hole, we will catch him." The company commander said: "Then why did you say that we were at a disadvantage shooting on the fifth target platform today?" Zhou Zhifu's face turned red, and he couldn't answer for a long time. The company commander said sincerely: "Didn't Chairman Mao say that work should pick the heavy burden to shoulder? On the battlefield, some enemy targets are obvious, and some enemies are more hidden. If we can eliminate the more hidden enemies, wouldn't we be more excellent? In my opinion, today's competition shows that our usual training has not proceeded from actual combat in all aspects, and we haven't practiced shooting exercises in various complex situations. This is our weak link!" These words opened Zhou Zhifu's mind, and since then he has been focusing on practicing difficult points. Look, this is our company commander, full of class feelings, using the revolutionary principles of Chairman Mao's works to improve everyone's class consciousness. Everything he does starts from this point, so the training is very active, and the results are very outstanding. Of course, he is also starting from difficulty, strictness, and actual combat in today's event, but starting from actual combat also requires attention to performance! We won't engage in deception, but Zhou Zhifu threw 71.3, which is a solid fact! Zhou Zhifu said that he stepped on the line, but even the staff officer from the regimental headquarters didn't notice it... No matter what, this approach is a bit too much. In fact, this view is not just me alone. After the whole company gathered, I found that many people's moods were somewhat similar to mine.
      "Comrades"! The company commander's bronze bell-like voice sounded, and the whole company came to attention with a "Ka". Along with this attention, the serious and tense spirit of us was immediately displayed. The company commander said "at ease," then continued: "Today's throwing test yielded a lot. Although the average score this time is a bit lower than a month ago, this is the score thrown after the field training and construction in the last few days. This shows that everyone's skills are still relatively solid. In particular, Comrade Zhou Zhifu can demand himself rigorously, not seeking vanity, and actively say that his farthest throw stepped on the line. This is a very good style, and this spirit is worth learning from every comrade. In summary, through this test, first, it shows that all the comrades in our company are working hard; second, it also made me personally discover the shortcomings of leading the training. The reason why today's average score has declined is mainly my responsibility. Because I didn't pay comprehensive attention to training. During the field training and construction period, I only emphasized shooting and paid little attention to throwing. I will definitely learn from this, improve my work, and work with everyone to do a better job and make our combat readiness work more implemented."
    Everyone was deeply moved by the company commander's speech, and even my little dissatisfaction just now seemed to disappear with his words! However, after the team dispersed, everyone couldn't help but discuss it. The focus of the discussion was Zhou Zhifu. Don't get me wrong, everyone wasn't blaming Zhou Zhifu, but was puzzled by his throwing today. His score of 71.3, if he stepped on the line, doesn't count, but why did the second and third grenades get closer and closer? It's understandable to be one meter or half a meter closer, but the last one only threw 58 meters... Even the staff comrade from the regimental headquarters felt sorry for him. When the company commander handed him the test score sheet today, he frowned and said, "It's a pity!" The company commander said, "Being realistic, what's a pity?" The staff member firmly grasped the company commander's hand and said, "Old Shi, today I not only got this score sheet here, but also learned an excellent style from you! But..." He choked up and said, "I've carefully inspected it again, and Zhou Zhifu's first grenade can barely be counted!" When I heard this, I was happy and interjected, "Can it?" The staff member said, "Only the toe touched the line, didn't cross it." I jumped up and said, "Then of course it doesn't count as stepping on the line!" The company commander glanced at me with dissatisfaction and said, "What are you shouting for? Go find the medic." I said, "The medic went to the battalion headquarters to listen to the medical assistant's lecture!" The company commander said, "Quick! Go call him back." I was stunned and asked, "Is something wrong?" The company commander said, "To treat Zhou Zhifu!" "To treat Zhou Zhifu?" I couldn't help but be startled again in my heart: How did the company commander know he was sick? The company commander said, "Didn't you see his eyes are a little red, and the grenades get closer and closer as he throws?" As soon as the company commander said this, the blood in my body was surging like a mountain torrent. Look at our company commander, how meticulously he observes problems! In the blink of an eye, his words "cultivating a meticulous style allows for correct and decisive judgment of the situation in battle" came alive again in my mind. Regarding Zhou Zhifu, didn't he judge that he was sick from the redness of his eyes and the fact that his grenades were getting closer and closer? Of course, this is not just a matter of meticulous observation, but more importantly, he is full of class feelings for every soldier! Thinking of this, a hope suddenly flashed in my mind. Since Zhou Zhifu is sick and the first grenade still threw 71.3 meters, to encourage him, and for the 50-meter record of the entire company, the company commander may agree with the staff's opinion! Unfortunately, because I had to go to the battalion headquarters to find the medic, I didn't hear the result of their conversation. When I was just leaving, I faintly heard the company commander say something about "Is it about politics or about achievements?" I didn't understand the details.
    I called the medic from the battalion headquarters, and the two of us ran back like we were in a 100-meter race. On the way, we met an old lady who stopped us and insisted on asking about an "A'hu". So the medic went first, leaving me to help the old lady figure out the situation.
    I asked the old lady: "What's the matter with looking for A'hu?" The old lady said: "Benefactor! He is our great benefactor." After careful questioning, I learned that the old lady's little grandson was fetching water at the well and accidentally fell in. Just as a PLA soldier was passing by, he heard the child's cry, jumped in and rescued the child. By the time the old lady arrived at the well, the PLA soldier had already left! Only a piece of letter paper starting with "Brother A'hu" was lost on the ground.
      "A'hu", where can you find this A'hu? There are three dragons and two tigers in our company. Starting from the company commander, a dragon, surnamed Shi, named Shi Renlong; in the second platoon, a dragon surnamed Chang, named Chang Xinglong; in the third platoon, a dragon surnamed Tian, named Tian Dalong. Speaking of two tigers, there are only Jiang Guihu and me, Cai Xiaohu. I've never heard of anyone named A'hu! So, I persuaded the old lady: "Old lady, go home and rest! There is no troop number, not to mention, there isn't even a surname. Where can you find this person?" The old lady said: "If I don't find this great benefactor and say thank you to his face, I will feel uneasy!" I said: "This is what he should do! Nowadays, everyone is learning from Lei Feng, doing such a small thing, it is so ordinary. If you want to thank, thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!" The old lady thought for a while and said: "That's right, these are all good soldiers taught by Chairman Mao! However, I beg you to keep an eye out for this comrade and put in some effort. Once you find out who this person is, please give me a message!" I fully agreed, in order to send the old lady home, but in fact, I had no idea at all!
    Regardless of whether I have any idea or not, the action of this A'hu moved me very much. I think if this comrade is found out, he will definitely be given a meritorious service. Right, go back and report this to the company commander. Even if we can't find out who it is, we can use him as a living teaching material and have all the comrades in the company learn from him! Anxious heart and fast feet, in a short while, I returned to the company headquarters. Of course, there is another reason for my anxiety, that is, I want to understand how Zhou Zhifu's throwing score was finally calculated. I was still outside the door when I shouted loudly: "Company commander! Company commander!" But when I got into the room, there was no one. I went next door to ask the clerk: "Where is the company commander?" The clerk said: "In the kitchen." I asked: "Is he helping the cook again?" The clerk said: "He is making sick food for Zhou Zhifu!" I asked again: "Hey, how was Zhou Zhifu's throwing score finally calculated?" The clerk swayed his head, blinked his eyes, and said: "This, hey," I immediately said: "71.3?" The clerk waved his hand and said: "Just go to the kitchen and ask the company commander." Okay! Ask the company commander. I turned around and hurried to the kitchen.
    When I got into the kitchen, I was stunned again!
    Why was I stunned? There's another reason here. Because the clerk told me that the company commander was making sick food for Zhou Zhifu in the kitchen. When I think of sick food, I naturally associate it with noodles. Some old comrades say that making noodles for sick people is an old tradition passed down from the Eighth Route Army. Plus our company commander is from Henan, and he can do anything with pasta, whether it's steaming buns or making dumplings, and making noodles is his specialty. Whenever there is a sick person in the company, as long as he knows about it, he always personally makes a bowl of noodles and brings it to them. Therefore, some old soldiers jokingly say: "Hey! Why are you drooping your head? Do you want to eat the noodles made by the company commander again!" However, the company commander is sitting on a small stool in this kitchen, concentrating on grinding rice flour!
    What's going on?
    I squatted down beside the company commander and asked: "What are you doing?" When the company commander saw me, he didn't answer my question, but instead asked: "Why did you come back so late?" So I told him about what happened on the road, in detail from beginning to end. Then I asked: "Company commander, where can we find this A'hu?" The company commander said to himself: "Oh! No wonder he has a high fever!" I hurriedly asked: "Who?" The company commander said: "Zhou Zhifu!" I said: "The old lady is looking for A'hu!" The company commander said: "A'hu is Zhou Zhifu's nickname." My heart jumped and said: "How do you know it's his nickname?" The company commander was sorting out the rice flour he had ground, and said: "I not only know that his nickname is A'hu, but also know that your nickname is A'chun!" "Ah!?" I almost shouted in shock. Our company commander, he, he knows every soldier better than he knows his own fingerprints! No wonder someone praised our company commander and said: "Shi Renlong has figured out the 'people's element first!' He knows the background, experiences, thoughts, and temperaments of every soldier so well, so he can work easily and the training results improve solidly!"
    The company commander sorted out the rice flour and asked: "Is the water boiled?" The squad leader of the cooking class replied: "It's boiled!" So, the company commander took the rice flour over and said: "Here, the rice flour is ground, quickly make it!" I asked inexplicably: "Is this making sick food for Zhou Zhifu?" The company commander said "Hmm." I asked again: "Why not make noodles?" The squad leader of the cooking class immediately tugged at me and whispered: "Don't mention noodles again! The company commander is sad about this!" I was even more confused! I asked: "Why?" Before the squad leader of the cooking class could speak, the company commander replied: "Because my work is average!" As he spoke, he picked up the made rice paste and went to the third platoon's dormitory!
    Today, I just keep encountering strange things. How did making sick food become average? After careful inquiry, I suddenly understood. It turned out that after the company commander persuaded the staff member of the regimental headquarters with the serious attitude of "This is not a question of a number, but whether we insist on emphasizing politics in handling all problems," he went to the kitchen to make a bowl of noodles. However, when the noodles were brought to Zhou Zhifu, Zhou Zhifu didn't eat them at all. The company commander persuaded him, but he just shook his head and said, "I'm not hungry." The company commander said: "If you're sick and don't eat, how can you get better? Come on, eat a little." Zhou Zhifu said: "Company commander, when I smell this noodle smell, I feel..." The company commander asked him: "Feel what?" However, he didn't say anything else. The company commander was very puzzled and walked out of the room to ask the squad leader of the ninth班. The squad leader of the ninth班 said: "Company commander, Zhou Zhifu is from Guangdong. He doesn't usually like to eat pasta. If he is sick, he likes to eat even less." When the company commander heard this, he felt a rush of heat on his face: "That's right, people from Guangdong, where do they like to eat such noodles? Sigh! I always say that the drum must be beaten on the point, the flute must be blown on the eye, and ideological work must be done to the heart. But this bowl of sick food has become irrelevant, average..." Because he has always regarded making sick food as ideological work; he always wants to associate what happens in peacetime with wartime thinking. So, he made a very serious self-criticism and immediately found several comrades from Guangdong and asked them what their mothers would make for them when they were sick at home. The rice paste that he just ground himself was the result of his investigation and research!
    Look! This is our company commander.
    My story ends here. You may ask me, "Why is your company commander so good?" This, I can tell you, is because he earnestly studies Chairman Mao's works. He often says to us: "For the revolution, we gather together from all directions; for the revolution, we are all tempered in the big furnace of the PLA; for the revolution, we must seriously read Chairman Mao's books, as Vice Chairman Lin Biao said, regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions for all work, and work hard on the word 'use' so that our thoughts, training, and style will be even better!"

    测验
    萧玉
    我姓蔡，名叫小虎，一九六三年入伍，前年调到连部当通信员。连长常说我，优点很多，缺点也很突出。主要的缺点是，嘴巴上少个岗哨，特别是遇到记者呀，文工团员呀，我总愿贡献点材料。对于连长这个批评，我心里总不太舒服，给记者贡献点材料嘛，那算什么缺点？当然了，贡献材料得实事求是，如果胡说八道，歪曲事实，那严重性可就大了。可我所贡献的材料，百分之百的真实可靠，那都是通过我的观察、体会，心里受了感动，嘴巴才讲的。那连长为啥还批评我呀？这里面有点内情，就是我贡献的材料，主角差不多都是连长。俺连长是个谦虚的人，最讨厌我对别人说他的特点儿。不过，他的所作所为，我硬是受感动，不当别人讲一讲，心里鼓鼓囊囊的，总觉着不舒服。譬如，最近又发生了一件事，我说出来大家听一听，评评该讲不该讲。
    一天下午，团司令部来了个参谋，向连长询问全连投弹的成绩。这位参谋，是跑完了其他连之后，才来到我们连，因此他把其他连的成绩，都告诉了我们连长。连长把那些成绩和我们连的一比，突然皱起眉头，半天没说话。是我们连的成绩不如别的连吗？不，我们连的成绩，最高达到过51．6米，最低也是50．3米，比起别的连来，可以说是遥遥领先的第一。那他为什么还皱眉头呢？这正是俺连长高贵的地方。他是想，不管是51．6米，还是50．3米，那都是野营以前测验的成绩。野营一个多月，虽然坚持了天天练，可由于环境和场地的限制，练射击多，练投弹少。野营回来以后，又去支援兄弟连队搞营建，昨天才刚刚回来，对于投弹，练的也不够。在这样的情况下，投弹成绩下降，是很可能的，如果还照原来的成绩上报，他觉得不实诚。因此，他征得了参谋的同意，又和指导员作了研究，利用下午的操课时间，一个班一个班，普遍重测一次，这次投出啥成绩，就报啥成绩。
    每逢投弹测验，我这个通信员的任务，就是和文书俩一起，负责登记成绩。炮排先投，成绩惊人。我一面登记，一面乐，若按这样投下去，全连的平均成绩，说不定还要超过51．6米呢！炮排投完之后，连部和伙房的人员投，尔后才按班排顺序，进行测验。由于连部和伙房人员投的成绩稍差了一点，再加二排又出了两个线外弹，所以到八班投完的时候，全连的平均成绩，闹了个49．7米！这时，我的心乒乒跳得厉害！我的天哪，就剩下九班没投了，九班若投出炮排的水平，全连的平均数还有希望提上去；九班若再不争气，那，全连的平均数，可就要掉下50米的纪录了。
    九班长带着九班来了。
    我想，在这个节骨眼上，连长一定向九班作作鼓动工作，让他们发挥冲天干劲，创造出奇迹，保证我们连的投弹成绩，绝不掉下50米的纪录。可是，当九班长向他作了报告之后，他却不动声色地只说了一个字：“投！”我暗自叨咕：这个连长啊，平时间最讲突出政治，不论干啥，都是要怎么细致就怎么细致，从来不带半点马虎。他常说：“养成周密细致的作风，打起仗来才能正确果断的判断情况！”为这，我还曾专门向别人夸奖过，说他不论干啥，脑子里总有“战备”两个字儿。可是在今天这关键的时刻，他为什么一反平常了呢？我正自想着，耳边已响起投弹员的声音：“55——”嗬！这一声55，提起了我的精神，若按这个投法，有门儿。这时刻，投弹者的每一步跳跃，每一个姿势，都和我的血肉相连；报弹员嘴里的每一个数字，都撞击着我的心。我的心情啊，就跟听国际乒乓球比赛的实况广播一样，说它怎么紧张，它就怎么紧张。“53”“49”“58．8”……啊！努努力，再来上两个60米以上的，就过关了！不，不用紧张了，全团出名的投弹能手周志福还没投呢！只要他略一使劲，少说也甩上70米以上。那，问题就完全彻底地解决了！可是，在张金泉投了个49．5米以后，九班长就下口令列队，向连长报告：“投弹完毕！”这时我才定睛看了看，原来周志福不在呀！我小声问文书：“周志福呢？”谁知，文书的心情比我还急，他已经在计算平均数了。他所问非所答的说：“糟！现在平均成绩是49．93，就差0．07，没上50大关啊！”0．07！一个人0．07，那么全连人需要18．4米啊！咳！周志福若在场，他只要投上个68．4，什么问题就都解决了！可是他到底为啥没来？我忍不住去问九班长，九班长说：“他请假到墟场去买毛选乙种本去了！”我说：“他不是有了吗？为啥又买。”九班长说：“他要再买一本，寄给他弟弟。”我十分惋惜地叹了口气说：“他若在，平均成绩就不会是49．93了！”九班长马上问我：“怎么，全连的平均成绩不够50？”我说：“可不，就差0．07呀！”九班长也把脚一跺：“哎呀，他现在回来就好了！”我说：“是啊！就得靠他把成绩攻上去了！”这时，突然有人说道：“打起仗来，你也光靠一个周志福！”我抬头一看，呀！是连长。我们说的话，全叫他给听去了。我说：“早知就投个49．93，还不如照原先的成绩上报了！”连长严肃地说：“咱现在投不到50米以上，那样报上去，岂不是欺骗上级！”接着又说：“毛主席不是说吗？大家都要如实反映情况。毛主席这么说的，咱就得这么做。”我说：“一个月以前，咱们投到51．6，也是实际情况啊！”连长说：“一个月以前是一个月以前，现在是现在。假定打起仗来，首长能根据咱以前的情况来使用咱们吗？小虎啊！你不要把这光看成是一个数字！这个数字，表示着咱们的战斗力量。打仗的时候，首长就是要根据实际的战斗力，使用兵力呀！”
    就在这个时候，有人向远处招着手，喊着“周志福，周志福——”我顺着他招手的方向一看，果然有个人，跑步而来。近前一看，嗬！真是周志福！他满头大汗，气喘吁吁地来了个立正，向连长敬个礼，报告道：“九班战士周志福，外出归队！”我正想说：“你回来得正好啊，这投弹测验，只差你这投弹能手没投了……”还没等我开口，九班长已经响当当地说了出来。可是，连长却不慌不忙，掏出他那半截毛巾，递给周志福，说道：“看你，汗把衣裳都溻湿了！先把汗擦一擦。”周志福接过毛巾，一边擦着汗，一边问：“今天进行投弹测验吗？”九班长马上说：“可不。咱们连的成绩，全靠你来提高了！”周志福把毛巾交还给连长，憨笑着说：“我尽力投就是了！”说着，就在地上，拣练习用的手榴弹。连长却上前制止说：“慢，你如果累的话，就不用投了！”我心里嘎郎一下，我的妈呀，他投不投，可关系着全连的“50大关”啊！虽然说，反对“一枪一弹定乾坤”的思想，可在这个节骨眼上，我的感情可真控制不住！我正想给连长提个意见，周志福不紧不慢地开了腔，“嘿嘿。你不常说，真打起仗来，冲上山头，气不匀，汗不消，就得和敌人死打硬拼吗？”连长这才说了一声：“好！那你就投吧！”
    哈！这一下，我们全连平均50米，可是戴上保险儿了！
    周志福不慌不忙，提起脚跟，跳了几跳，接着又车起胳膀，前前后后，晃了几圈儿。然后退到投弹线后面五米左右的地方，弯腰把右手向沙土地上轻轻一擦，才把手榴弹的木柄握了起来。就凭他这几个动作，就看得出是个老练的投弹能手。看：他左腿一屈，右腿往后一蹬，胸脯略微向前一匍，膀子一晃，便蹭蹭地跑了起来。当快到投弹线的时候，他来个小垫步，右胳膀向后一伸，身子略略一仰，“嗖”！手榴弹出手了！那手榴弹象火箭似的，发出“呜——”的响声，战胜空气的阻挠，猛向前飞去，飞去……一直到它“呯”地落到地上，把土砸起一股黄烟儿，我才又紧张地等待着报弹员那优美高亢的声音。
      “71．3——”
    “好！”我乐得差点儿蹦了起来。这一下，一切问题都解决了！
    眨眼的工夫，他把第二个弹又投了出去。我想，这一下他可能创造更高的纪录。可是报弹员却有声无力的报道：“62．4”。
    这是怎么搞的呀？我正在纳闷儿，第三个弹也落了地。谁知，这第三个更糟糕，仅仅投了58米。咳！这还幸亏头一下呢。因为按照教令的规定，测验时每人投三次，以最远的一次作为正式成绩。这样，71．3，还是把全连的成绩，给提到50米以上了！
    报弹员报道：“最远弹，71．3。”
    不等他报，我和文书已经登记好了。
    可是，就在这个节骨眼儿，周志福却说：“不，我的最远弹，是62．4。”他这话，声音虽然不高，却象劈雷一样，震得我的耳朵嗡嗡响。明明最远弹是71．3嘛，为啥偏说是62．4呢？要知道，这个71．3和62．4，关系着我们全连的成绩能不能平均上50米啊！看起来，九班长的心情和我差不多。他急忙说道：“明明是71．3嘛！”周志福却仍不紧不慢地说：“投头一个弹的时候，我踩了线！”九班长惊讶地说：“踩了线？我没见你踩线呀！”周志福肯定地说：“是踩了线。”九班长红着脸对连长说：“连长！你看这……”连长却象不着急似的，蹲了下来，仔细在粉线内外检查。半晌，突然站了起来，紧紧握住了周志福的手，声音响亮地说：“好同志，你作得对！”九班长愣睁睁地嗫嚅着说：“可是……”连长说：“可是什么？周志福同志这种精神，比71．3还要过硬得多！”然后转身对我说：“告诉值星排长，全连集合！”
    说句老实话，我对连长这种作法，可憋着一肚子意见。哎，为了把问题说明白，我爽性就罗索两句，把他入伍以来的经历和表现说一说。他姓史，名叫史仁龙，今年才刚满二十五岁。他是一九五九年入伍，去年年底就当连长。中等个头，不胖不瘦，再加长了一对又黑又亮的大眼，显得越发有朝气。同样是队列行进，他一喊口令，步伐就格外整齐，精神就特别充沛！大家都说，他是一员闯将。他入伍的头一年，就成了特等射手，千里野营的时候，脚上打了十八个血泡，还坚持没掉队。他当了班长，又和全班一起，创造了四好班，不论思想、训练、作风、生活，样样冒尖，处处过硬。军首长在大会上，口口声声的表扬他。你看，营房左边那排木麻黄，是他为了挡风沙，一棵一棵栽起来的；操场上那补钉加补钉的木马，是他一针一线补起来的。特别是通厕所的石阶，是他刚被提升排长的第二天，脱光了膀子，领着大家修起来的。当时，有的人还开着玩笑对他说：“喂！当了干部还脱光膀子干哪？”他马上说：“当干部怎么样？咱当干部是接班，可不是接官啊！越是当了干部，越要发扬老传统。”他总是这样，不声不响地闷头工作。有了成绩，他统统归到党支部和全体同志的账上；有了缺点，就带头作自我检讨。反正在他心里就揣着两个字：“革命”！“革命”这两个字再落实到他的工作中，就是“战备”。要把战备搞好，他选择的突破口，是作好人的思想工作。别看是他个军事干部，作起思想工作来，象姑娘绣花似的，又耐心，又细致。不论什么事儿，他都说得入情入理，叫人听了心服口服。八月间，他带领九班到团里参加射击比赛，总评成绩搞了个第三。回来的路上，周志福小声向九班长叨咕：“今个呀，咱们若不是在第五号靶台上射击，保险拿第一。”九班长说：“是啊！这第五号靶子目标太不清楚，紧紧设在一棵小松树旁边，再加太阳一反光，简直看不清楚。”周志福说：“反正，咱是有点吃亏呀！”周志福的话，俺连长听在耳里，记在心里。回家卸下装备，洗了脸，马上就找他个别谈话。他不提今天射击的事儿，倒先出了个题目：“射击比赛是为了什么？”周志福流利的回答：“为了检验我们的训练成绩呀！”连长又问：“训练是为了什么呢？”周志福说：“为了消灭敌人！”连长又问：“到了战场上，敌人若是躲在小松树旁边，你要不要消灭他？”周志福说：“那还用说，他就是躲在兔子窟窿里，咱也要把他抓出来。”连长说：“那你为什么说咱今天在第五号靶台上射击，是吃了亏呢？”周志福脸一红，半天没答上话，连长又诚恳地说：“毛主席不是说，工作要拣重担子挑吗？到了战场上，有的敌人目标明显，有的敌人比较隐蔽。我们若能把比较隐蔽的敌人都消灭了，岂不是更过硬？依我看，今天的比赛，正说明了咱们平时训练，没能处处从实战出发，练好各种复杂情况下的射击练习。这是咱们的薄弱环节啊！”一席话，开了周志福的心窍，此后训练，他就专找难点练习。看看，俺连长就是这样，充满着阶级感情，用毛主席著作的革命道理，提高大家的阶级觉悟。他一切的一切，都从这出发，所以训练搞得非常活跃，成绩非常突出。当然了，今天这件事，他也是从难从严，从实战出发，可是从实战出发，也得讲究点成绩呀！弄虚作假咱不干，可是周志福投了71．3，那是铁板凳钉钢钉，响当当的事实啊！周志福说他踩了线，可是在场的团部参谋也没发现啊……不管怎么说，这种作法是有点儿过分。其实，这种看法，不光是我一个人，全连集合起来以后，我发现不少人的心情，都有点和我类似。
      “同志们”！连长铜钟似的嗓门一响，全连“咔”的一个立正。随着这个立正，马上就表现了我们那种严肃紧张的精神。连长说了声稍息，就接着讲道：“今天的投弹测验，收获很大。虽然这次平均成绩，比一个多月以前有些下降，但这是在野营和近几天营建以后投出的成绩，这说明大家的技术还是比较巩固的。特别是周志福同志，能够从难从严地要求自己，不图虚荣，主动说出自己的最远弹是踩了线，这是非常好的作风，这种精神值得我们每一个同志学习。总起来一句话，通过这次测验，第一，说明了我们全连同志都很努力；第二，也使我个人发现了领导训练的缺点。今天的平均成绩所以有所下降，主要是我的责任。因为我抓训练还抓得不全面，在野营和营建期间，光重视了射击，对投弹就抓得很少。我一定从这当中吸取教训，改进工作，和大家一起，把工作做得更好，使我们的备战工作，更加落实。”
    连长的讲话，大家很受感动，就连我刚才那一点不满情绪，好象也随着他的话，不翼而飞了！可是队伍解散之后，大家仍不免议论纷纷。议论的焦点，是周志福。千万别误会，大家不是埋怨周志福，而是对他今天的投弹有些纳闷儿。他71．3的成绩，踩了线不算数，可第二第三个弹，为什么越投越近呢？近个一米半米也有情可原，可是最后一个，才投了58米呀……就是团部的参谋同志，也为他惋惜。当连长把今天的测验成绩登记表交给他的时候，他眉头皱得老高说：“太遗憾了！”连长却说：“实事求是嘛，有什么遗憾的？”参谋紧紧握着连长的手说：“老史，我今天在这里，不仅拿到了这份成绩登记表，而且从你身上，学到了优良作风！不过……”他打了个哽儿，说：“我又仔细地作了检查，周志福第一个弹，也可以勉强计算成绩！”我一听，乐了，插嘴问：“可以吗？”参谋说：“仅仅是脚尖碰了粉线一下，没越过。”我跳了起来说：“那当然不算踩线了！”连长却不满的瞅了我一眼，说：“你吵什么？快找卫生员去。”我说：“卫生员到营部听医助讲课去了！”连长说：“快！去把他叫回来。”我一愣，问：“有事吗？”连长说：“给周志福看病！”“给周志福看病？”我心里禁不住又吃了一惊：连长怎么知道他有病呢？连长说：“你没见他眼睛有点发红，投弹越投越近吗！”连长这么一说，我浑身的血，象山洪暴发一样的奔腾。瞧我们这连长，观察问题多么细致呀！眨眼之间，他说的那“养成周密细致的作风，打起仗来才能正确果断的判断情况”这句话，又在我脑子里活了起来。对于周志福，他不就是从眼睛发红和投弹越投越近，判断出他有病了吗！当然，这不光是个细致观察的问题，更重要的是他对每个战士都充满着阶级感情！想到这里，我脑子里突然又闪出了一个希望，既然周志福有了病，头一个弹还投了71．3米，为了鼓励他，也为了全连的50米纪录，连长也许会同意参谋的意见呢！可惜，我因为要到营部去找卫生员，没听到他们谈话的结果，在我刚离开的时候，隐隐约约的听到连长说了句“是要政治还是要成绩”的话，详情细节，没闹清楚。
    我从营部叫上卫生员，两个人象赛百米似的往回跑。半路上遇到一个阿婆，拦住我们，非要打听一个“阿虎”不可。于是卫生员先走，留下我，帮阿婆把情况闹清楚。
    我问阿婆：“找阿虎有什么事？”阿婆说：“恩人！他是我们的大恩人。”经我仔细询问，才知道是阿婆的小孙孙到井上打水，没留神，掉了下去。正好有个解放军战士路过，听到小孩的喊声，跳下去把小孩救了上来。等阿婆赶到井上，这个解放军战士已经走了！只有一张开头写着“阿虎哥”的信纸失落在地上。
      “阿虎”，这可到哪去找这个阿虎呢？我们连倒有三龙二虎。打从连长那一龙，姓史，叫史仁龙；二排那一龙姓常，叫常兴龙；三排那一龙姓田，叫田大龙。说到二虎，那就只有蒋桂虎和我这蔡小虎了，从来还没听说有谁叫阿虎呢！于是，我劝阿婆说：“阿婆，你快回家去休息吧！这没有部队番号不说，连个姓儿都没有的人，你到哪去找呢？”阿婆说：“这大恩人，我不找到他，当面说声谢谢，心里不安生啊！”我说：“这是他应该做的嘛！如今大家都学雷锋，做这么点事，那还不平平常常。你要谢，就谢谢共产党和毛主席吧！”阿婆想了想说：“可也是，这都是毛主席他老人家教导出来的好战士啊！不过，我求你这位同志留留神，费费心，一旦打听出这个人，可千万给我个信儿啊！”我满口答应，为的是打发阿婆回家，其实，心里可没有一点底呀！
    不管我心里有底没有底，这个阿虎的行动，使我很受感动。我想，这个同志若被查出来，非给他立个功不可。对，回去把这件事向连长汇报汇报，就是查不出是谁，也可以把他当成活教材，要全连同志学习嘛！心急脚步快，不大一会儿的功夫，我就回到了连部。当然了，我这心急，还有另外一层原因，那就是想了解了解周志福的投弹成绩，最后到底是怎么算的。我还在门外，就大声喊：“连长！连长！”可是进到屋里一看，一个人没有。我到隔壁去问文书：“连长呢？”文书说：“在厨房。”我问：“他又帮厨去了？”文书说：“在给周志福做病号饭！”我又问：“哎，周志福的投弹成绩到底怎么算的？”文书把脑袋一晃，眨了眨眼，说道：“这呀，嘿，”我马上说：“71．3？”文书把手一摆说：“干脆，你到厨房里去问连长吧。”成！问连长就问连长。我一转身，就急忙跑到了厨房。
    进到厨房一看，我又愣睁睁地呆住了！
    为啥发愣呢？这里面又有一层原因。因为文书告诉我，连长是在厨房里给周志福做病号饭。一提病号饭，我很自然的就和面条联系在一起。有些老同志说，给病号做面条吃，这是从八路军的时候就传下来的老传统。再加我们连长又是河南人，对于做面食，不论蒸馍还是包饺子，样样都行，至于做面条，那更是他的拿手好戏，连里有了病号，只要他知道了，总是亲自做上一碗面条，给端到跟前去。因此，有些老兵开玩笑的时候，还这样说：“喂！干嘛耷拉着脑袋呀？是不是又想吃连长亲手做的面条了！”可是，眼下连长在这厨房里，却是坐在个小板凳上，聚精会神地磨大米粉！
    这是怎么回事呢？
    我蹲到连长身旁问道：“你这是干啥呀？”连长一见是我，没回答我的问题，反而问道：“你怎么才回来？”于是，我就把路上遇到的事，从头至尾、详详细细地对他说了一遍。尔后我问道：“连长，你看这个阿虎，可到哪去找啊！”连长却自言自语地说：“哦！无怪乎他发了高烧了！”我急忙问：“谁？”连长说：“周志福！”我说：“人家阿婆找的是阿虎啊！”连长说：“阿虎，是周志福的小名儿。”我的心猛然一跳说：“你怎么知道是他的小名呢？”连长一面收拾着他磨好的米粉，一面说：“我不光知道他的小名叫阿虎，还知道你的小名叫阿春呢！”“啊！？”我吃惊得几乎喊出来。我们的连长啊，他，他了解每一个战士，比了解他自己的指纹都清楚啊！无怪乎有人夸奖我们连长说：“史仁龙算是把人的因素第一咂透了！他把每一个战士的出身经历，思想和脾气都摸得一清二楚，所以作起工作来就得心应手，训练成绩就扎扎实实的提高！”
    连长收拾好米粉，问道：“水烧开了没有？”炊事班长应声说：“开了！”于是，连长端着米粉走了过去，说：“来，米粉也磨好了，快给做上吧！”我莫名其妙地问道：“这是给周志福做病号饭吗？”连长“嗯”了一声。我又问：“为什么不做面条呢？”炊事班长马上扯了我一下，悄声说：“再别提面条了！连长正为这事，心里难过呢！”我越发糊涂了！问道：“为什么？”炊事班长还没开口，连长却应了声：“因为我的工作一般化啊！”说着，他就端起做好的米粉糊糊，向三排宿舍去了！
    今天这一天哪，我可净碰见些怪事儿。这做病号饭，怎么也出来了一般化呢？经我仔细打听，才恍然大悟。原来，当连长用“这不是一个数目字问题，而是我们在处理一切问题是不是坚持突出政治”的严肃态度，说服了团部参谋拿走了投弹测验成绩表以后，自己就到厨房做了一碗面条。但是，面条端到周志福面前，周志福却一点没吃。连长劝他，他只摇摇头说：“我不饿。”连长说：“有病，再不吃东西，那怎么行？来，多少吃一点。”周志福说：“连长，我闻到这面条味，心里就……”连长问他：“就怎么样？”可是，他再什么也不说了。连长心里非常纳闷儿，走出屋来问九班长。九班长说：“连长，周志福是广东人，他平时都不爱吃面食，有了病，就更不爱吃了。”连长一听，心里刷地一下，脸上直觉发烧：“可不，广东人，哪里爱吃这样的面条呢？咳！天天说鼓要打到点上，笛要吹到眼上，思想工作要做到心坎上。可这一碗病号饭，竟弄了个文不对题，一般化啊……”因为他从来都把做病号饭，看成是思想工作；他总愿把平时所发生的事情，联系到战时去着想。于是，他非常严肃地作了自我批评，并马上找了几个广东籍的同志，询问他们在家有了病的时候，妈妈都给做什么吃的。他刚才亲自磨米粉，做的米粉糊糊，正是他调查研究的结果啊！
    瞧！这就是我们的连长。
    我这个故事，说到这里就算完了。大家也许问我，“你们连长为啥这样好呢？”这，我可以告诉大家，因为他认真地学习毛主席著作，他经常对我们说：“为了革命，咱们从四面八方凑在一起；为了革命，咱们都在解放军这座大熔炉里锻炼；为了革命，咱们要认真地读毛主席的书，象林彪副主席说的那样，把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示，在‘用’字上狠下功夫，使咱们的思想、训练和作风，更上一层楼！”
