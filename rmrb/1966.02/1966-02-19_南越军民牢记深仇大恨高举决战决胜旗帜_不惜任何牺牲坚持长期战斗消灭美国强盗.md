    South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency Issues Statement Condemning US Imperialism for Strengthening and Expanding the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
    South Vietnamese Armymen and Civilians Remember Deep Hatred and Hold High the Banner of Decisive Victory
    Willing to Make Any Sacrifice to Persist in Long-Term Struggle to Eliminate American Bandits
    Editor's Note: Recently, US imperialism has been increasingly strengthening and expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, attempting to force the South Vietnamese people to submit through cruel "sweeps" and inhumane "scorched earth" policies. Such ferocious actions by the American aggressors will certainly not intimidate the heroic South Vietnamese people; on the contrary, they will only arouse their hundredfold hatred and further strengthen their will to fight decisively and win. In the past twenty-odd days, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces have thwarted the US military's multi-pronged, frenzied offensives with heroic counterattacks, inflicting heavy blows on the American aggressors.
    The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency issued a statement on the 12th, reiterating the South Vietnamese people's determination to drive out the American aggressor bandits at any cost; and calling on all South Vietnamese people to deepen their hatred for the enemy, persist in fierce and long-term battles, eliminate the American aggressors and their lackeys, defend their homeland, and liberate their territory. Millions of heroic sons and daughters of South Vietnam will, with deep hatred for the aggressors, launch more courageous battles and push their victorious people's war to a new stage.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th: The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency issued a statement on the 12th, strongly condemning the US imperialism and its running dogs for strengthening and expanding their war of aggression and the barbarous crimes they committed in South Vietnam.
    The statement emphasized that no barbaric act of US imperialism can subdue the Vietnamese people, and the Vietnamese people are determined to overcome all difficulties, make any sacrifice, and drive out the American aggressors. The statement said that the South Vietnam National Liberation Front calls on the South Vietnamese armymen and civilians to hold high the banner of decisive victory against the American bandits, bravely rush towards the enemy, and eliminate them.
    The statement pointed out that the higher the American aggressors and their running dogs sing their "peace" tunes, the more frequently they launch one cruel "sweep" after another. While they send high-ranking politicians around the world peddling fake peace goods, they are also brazenly implementing the "scorched earth" policy of burn all, destroy all, and kill all in South Vietnam. They plot to turn South Vietnam into an uninhabited "dead zone."
    The statement pointed out that, clearly, the American aggressors and their running dogs want to wage a destructive war in South Vietnam. It is worth noting that recently, at the Honolulu Conference, the American aggressors and their running dogs also planned to further expand their criminal acts, plotting to intensify the massacre of our people.
    The statement emphasized that the inhumane acts of the American aggressors and their running dogs powerfully shattered all the empty talks of the Johnson group about "seeking peace."
    The statement pointed out that the US imperialism and its running dogs' use of such crazy burning and killing methods does not indicate their strength. It only proves that the imperialists are very stubborn and also proves that they are terrified. They have suffered repeated defeats and are now panicking as they see themselves being pushed deeper and deeper into the abyss of complete defeat.
    The statement said that today, facing the destructive war of the American aggressors and their running dogs, our South Vietnamese people are facing a critical moment of life and death. The US imperialism and its running dogs' attempt to force our people to submit through massacres is merely a wild fantasy. Even when they established thousands of prisons and dragged guillotine to threaten village after village, our people, even unarmed, also stood up resolutely to resist them. Moreover, today our people's spiritual and material strength has increased hundreds of times, and has pushed the enemy into a passive and difficult situation. In this situation, no force, no conspiracy, no barbaric act of persecution can subdue our people who are winning.
    The statement said, "Therefore, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front calls on all South Vietnamese people to deepen their hatred for the enemy, unite as one, closely unite, promote the completion of all revolutionary tasks, use political violence and armed violence, persist in fierce and long-term battles, eliminate the American aggressors and their running dogs, defend their lives and property, defend their homeland, and liberate the territory. The South Vietnam National Liberation Front calls on the Liberation Armed Forces to remember the deep hatred for the American aggressors and their running dogs for generations to come. We must bravely rush forward to avenge those compatriots who have been massacred by them, liberate our compatriots, and eliminate the American aggressor bandits and traitorous running dogs. We must hold high the banner of decisive victory against the American bandits, keep rushing towards the enemy, eliminate them, avenge our family and country, move forward, liberate the South, defend the North, and unify the motherland.
      "The South Vietnam National Liberation Front calls on the American people who love peace and uphold justice to cooperate with the Vietnamese people in conducting a resolute struggle to stop the murderous hands of the US imperialist aggressors, defeat the US authorities' war of aggression, to safeguard the reputation of the United States, and protect the lives of American youth.
      "The South Vietnam National Liberation Front calls on the peace-loving countries, international organizations, all people who love justice, and fair-minded public opinion on the five continents to raise their voices against the barbaric killing acts of the American aggressors and their running dogs, demanding that they must stop the war of aggression, withdraw the United States and its puppet troops, and let the Vietnamese people solve their own internal affairs."
    The statement concluded, "Our people's hatred for the American aggressors and their running dogs is growing deeper and deeper. No matter whether we have to fight for five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, our people are determined to fight to the end until final victory. Our people are determined to overcome all difficulties, make any sacrifice, and are determined to drive out the American aggressors and their running dogs, to realize the sacred task of liberating the South, defending the North, and then unifying the motherland."

    南越解放通讯社发表声明谴责美帝加强和扩大侵越战争
    南越军民牢记深仇大恨高举决战决胜旗帜
    不惜任何牺牲坚持长期战斗消灭美国强盗
    编者按　最近以来，美帝国主义正在日益加强和扩大侵略越南的战争，企图以残酷的“扫荡”和灭绝人性的“焦土”政策来迫使南越人民屈服。美国侵略者这种穷凶极恶的行动，当然是吓不倒英雄的南越人民的，相反的，只能激起他们百倍的仇恨，更加增强他们决战决胜的意志。近二十多天来，南越人民武装力量就以英勇的反击，挫败了美军的多路疯狂攻势，给予了美国侵略者以沉重的打击。
    越南南方解放通讯社十二日发表声明，重申南越人民不惜任何牺牲，一定要把美国侵略强盗赶出去的决心；并且号召全体越南南方人民，加深对敌人的仇恨，坚持激烈和长期的战斗，消灭美国侵略者及其走狗，保卫家乡，解放国土。南越千千万万的英雄儿女，必将怀着对侵略者的深仇大恨，展开更勇猛的战斗，把他们正在胜利地进行的人民战争推向新的阶段。
    新华社河内十八日电　越南南方解放通讯社十二日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗加强和扩大侵略战争、在越南南方犯下的野蛮罪行。
    声明强调指出，美帝国主义任何野蛮的行为，都不能使越南人民屈服，越南人民决心克服一切困难，不惜任何牺牲，一定要把美国侵略者赶出去。声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线号召越南南方军民高高地举起决战决胜美国强盗的旗帜，英勇地冲向敌人，把敌人消灭掉。
    声明指出，美国侵略者及其走狗的“和平”调子唱得越高，就越频繁地展开一次又一次残酷的“扫荡”。当它们派遣高级政客走遍世界兜售假和平货色的时候，也正是它们在越南南方悍然执行烧光、毁光、杀光的“焦土”政策的时候。它们阴谋把越南南方造成毫无人烟的“死亡地区”。
    声明指出，显然，美国侵略者及其走狗想在越南南方进行一场毁灭性的战争。值得注意的是，最近，美国侵略者及其走狗在檀香山会议上还策划进一步扩大它们的罪恶行动，阴谋加紧屠杀我们人民。
    声明强调说，美国侵略者及其走狗惨无人道的行为有力地粉碎了约翰逊集团的所谓“谋求和平”等所有的空谈。
    声明指出，美帝国主义及其走狗使用这种疯狂的烧、杀手段，绝不是表明它们强大。这只能证明帝国主义者非常顽固，同时也证明它们是胆战心惊。它们已接连遭到了失败，并且正在惊慌地看到它们正日益被推向彻底失败的深渊。
    声明说，今天，面对着美国侵略者及其走狗的毁灭性战争，我们越南南方人民正面临着生死存亡关头。美帝国主义及其走狗妄图用屠杀手段来强迫我国人民屈服，这只是一种猖狂的幻想。就在它们建立起数以千计的监狱，拖着砍头机去威胁一村又一村的时候，我国人民还只是赤手空拳，但也曾经顽强地站起来抗击了它们。何况今天我国人民的精神力量和物质力量已经增加数百倍，已经把敌人推向被动和窘迫的境地。在这种情况下，任何力量、任何阴谋诡计、任何野蛮的迫害行为，也都不能使正在战胜的我国人民屈服。
    声明说，“因此，越南南方民族解放阵线号召全体越南南方人民加深对敌人的仇恨，万众一心，紧密团结，促进完成一切革命任务，使用政治暴力和武装暴力，坚持激烈和长期的战斗，消灭美国侵略者及其走狗，保卫自己的生命和财产，保卫家乡，解放国土。越南南方民族解放阵线号召解放武装力量要世世代代铭记对美国侵略者及其走狗的深仇大恨。要英勇地冲上前去，替那些已经被它们屠杀的同胞报仇，解放我们的同胞，消灭美国侵略强盗和卖国走狗。要高高地举起决战决胜美国强盗的旗帜，一直冲向敌人，把它们消灭掉，报家仇、雪国恨，向前迈进，解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国。
      “越南南方民族解放阵线呼吁爱好和平和维护正义的美国人民配合越南人民进行坚决的斗争，以制止美帝国主义侵略者的杀人魔手，击败美国当局的侵略战争，以维护美国的名誉，保卫美国青年的生命。
      “越南南方民族解放阵线呼吁世界上爱好和平的国家、国际组织、所有爱好正义的人士和五大洲的正直舆论发出自己的声音，反对美国侵略者及其走狗野蛮的杀人行为，要求它们必须停止侵略战争，撤回美国和它的仆从军队，让越南人民自己解决自己的内部事情。”
    声明最后说，“我们人民对美国侵略者及其走狗的仇恨越来越深。不管要打五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间，我们人民也决心打到底，直至最后胜利。我们人民决心克服一切困难，不惜任何牺牲，决心要把美国侵略者及其走狗赶出去，实现解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国的神圣任务。”
