    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 15th. The Albanian newspaper "Voice of the People" published an editorial on the 15th, condemning the Indonesian reactionaries for illegally interrogating and persecuting leaders of the Indonesian Communist Party and other progressive figures.
    The article stated that anti-communist secret trials have begun in Jakarta, attempting to accuse the Communist Party of committing "crimes." The Indonesian reactionaries are trying to use this hypocritical trial to exonerate themselves from the serious crimes they have committed against communists and to legalize the eventual banning of the Communist Party.
    The article said, "Millions of freedom-loving democrats around the world cannot but be angered by the Indonesian reactionaries' malicious conspiracy to attack and eliminate the outstanding sons and daughters of Indonesia. This trial organized by the reactionary ringleaders of Indonesia shows that they have completely abandoned any respect for the law." The article said, "However, no matter how hard the Indonesian reactionaries try, they will never be able to tarnish the lofty reputation of the Indonesian Communist Party. Since its establishment, the Indonesian Communist Party has stood at the forefront of the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and feudalism and in defense of national independence. It enjoys a high prestige not only among the Indonesian people but also among the people of the world. The Indonesian right-wing forces' expansion of the attack on the Communist Party and mass organizations connected with it, and the strengthening of anti-communist and anti-people measures, undermine the foundation of Indonesia's freedom and independence, and create conditions for Indonesia to fall into the enslavement of the imperialists. The Indonesian Communist Party is the mainstay of the Indonesian anti-American united front. Precisely for this reason, American imperialism, through its servants, is attacking the main force of the Indonesian revolution, the long-tested vanguard of the Indonesian people and all democratic and patriotic forces—the Indonesian Communist Party."
    The article pointed out, "There is a close connection between American imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries. The United States is involved in a grand conspiracy to split the anti-imperialist front in Asia. It is not difficult to understand that the Indonesian reactionaries' efforts to attack the Communist Party are fully in line with American imperialism's aggressive plans in Asia. The Indonesian reactionaries and American imperialism are sparing no effort to turn Indonesia into a new base against the people of Asian countries."
    The article also pointed out that "While launching a frenzied anti-communist and anti-democratic movement at home, the Indonesian reactionaries are also increasingly engaged in activities that undermine the good relations between Indonesia and China. It is no accident that China was chosen as the main target of their anti-communist movement. For American imperialists, modern revisionists, and all other reactionaries, China is the main obstacle to their dream of dominating the world. However, the Indonesian reactionaries' anti-China demonstrations and their shameless provocations against the People's Republic of China are extremely clumsy farces. It is impossible for the Indonesian people not to love the Chinese people, because the Indonesian people and the Chinese people are linked together in the long struggle against the common enemies, the colonialists and imperialists."
    The article concluded, "At this time when the Indonesian communists and the Indonesian people are undergoing severe tests, the Albanian people, like progressive humanity throughout the world, resolutely condemn the new crimes of the reactionaries in persecuting Indonesian patriots. Slander, defamation, trials, and any other conspiracy will never shake our complete support and solidarity with the struggle and just cause of the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people."

    阿《人民之声报》谴责印度尼西亚反动派为美帝效劳
    坚决声援印度尼西亚共产党的正义斗争
    印度尼西亚反动派疯狂反华是极拙劣的丑剧
    新华社地拉那十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十五日发表一篇编辑部文章，谴责印度尼西亚反动派对印度尼西亚共产党领导人和其他进步人士的非法审讯和迫害。
    文章说，雅加达开始进行反共的秘密审讯。企图指控共产党犯下了“罪行”。印度尼西亚反动派企图通过这种虚伪的审讯来开脱他们对共产党人犯下的严重罪行，使最终禁止共产党合法化。
    文章说，“世界上千百万爱好自由的民主人士不能不对印度尼西亚反动派企图打击和消灭印度尼西亚优秀儿女的恶毒阴谋感到愤怒。印度尼西亚反动头子组织的这次审讯表明，他们已经彻底放弃了对任何法律的尊重。”文章说，“但是，不管印度尼西亚反动派如何枉费心机，他们永远也不能够玷污印度尼西亚共产党的崇高声誉。自从印度尼西亚共产党成立以来，它就一直站在印度尼西亚人民反帝、反封建、保卫民族独立的斗争的前线。它不仅在印度尼西亚人民中、而且在全世界人民中享有崇高的威信。印度尼西亚右派势力扩大对共产党和同它有联系的群众组织的进攻，加强反共反人民的措施，这样就破坏了印度尼西亚自由和独立的基础，并且为使印度尼西亚陷入帝国主义者的奴役创造了条件。印度尼西亚共产党是印度尼西亚反美统一战线的中流砥柱。正因为如此，美帝国主义通过它的仆从打击印度尼西亚革命的主要力量、印度尼西亚人民和所有民主爱国力量的久经考验的先锋队——印度尼西亚共产党。”
    文章指出，“在美帝国主义和印度尼西亚反动派之间存在着紧密的联系。美国参与了分裂亚洲反帝战线的大阴谋。不难理解，印度尼西亚反动派打击共产党的努力完全符合美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略计划。印度尼西亚反动派和美帝国主义正在不择手段地使印度尼西亚变为反对亚洲各国人民的新的基地。”
    文章还指出，“印度尼西亚反动派在国内掀起疯狂反共、反民主运动的同时，还越来越起劲地从事破坏印度尼西亚和中国之间的良好关系的活动。选择中国作为他们反共运动的主要目标，这不是偶然的。对于美帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和所有其他反动派来说，中国是他们实现主宰世界的梦想的主要障碍。但是，印度尼西亚反动派的反华示威、他们对中华人民共和国的无耻挑衅是十分拙劣的丑剧。印度尼西亚人民不可能不爱中国人民，因为在反对共同敌人殖民主义者和帝国主义者的长期斗争中，印度尼西亚人民和中国人民联结在一起。”
    文章最后说，“在印度尼西亚共产党人和印度尼西亚人民经受严重考验的这个时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界进步的人类一样，坚决谴责反动派迫害印度尼西亚爱国者的新的罪恶。诬蔑、诽谤、审讯和任何其它阴谋都永远动摇不了我们对印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民的斗争和正义事业的完全支持和声援。”
