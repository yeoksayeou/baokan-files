　　A chapter from the memoirs of former US commander in Korea and later US Army Chief of Staff, Ridgway, was published in the January 3rd issue of "U.S. News & World Report". We now excerpt and annotate it as follows:

　　In the spring of 1954, as the Department of Defense concentrated its greatest efforts on developing our capacity for large-scale atomic strikes, we were very close to being drawn into a jungle bloodbath where our nuclear capability would have been almost useless.

　　At that time, a heroic French garrison—composed mainly of mercenaries from the Foreign Legion because France did not want to conscript its own young men to fight in Indochina—was putting up a brave but futile resistance at Dien Bien Phu.

　　To military personnel familiar with the geography of Indochina, the outcome of that siege was a foregone conclusion. The battle could only end in one way—the defenders dead or captured. The decision to fight at Dien Bien Phu was not based on military considerations. It was essentially politically motivated—the purpose being to prop up the tottering Laos before the Chinese advance. (The French colonialists were waging war in Indochina to maintain their colonial rule in the region, while Ridgway absurdly claimed that China was "advancing" into Laos.)

　　Regardless of how futile the resistance and fighting were in that place, the heroic spirit of the French garrison in hard fighting still shocked the world. (On the contrary, it was the victory of the Indochinese people that shocked the world.) Soon, I was very uneasily hearing voices from influential figures inside and outside the government raising the call: the time has come to "test the New Look policy," and Indochina is precisely the place where we should send troops to aid France in trying it out.

　　At the same time, the old, vain claim was put forward again that we could easily do it cheaply by just sending the Air Force and Navy to Indochina.

　　To me, this was an ominous sign. Because I was sure that if we sent the Air Force and Navy to that region, we would have to immediately send ground troops to support them.

　　I also knew that those who advocated taking this step had no idea how much blood and money such action would cost us and how much effort the nation would have to make. Therefore, I felt that everyone who could influence the decision on this serious issue must fully understand all the relevant factors.

　　To provide these facts, I sent an Army team of experts from all fields to Indochina, including engineers, signal and communications personnel, medical personnel, and experienced combat commanders who knew how to assess terrain from a tactical combat perspective. They set off with many questions that those who grandiosely suggested we go there to fight had not even considered.

　　How deep is the water in the canals outside Saigon? What are the port and dock facilities like? Where can we store the massive amount of supplies we would need there? What is the road network like—how will supplies be transported as combat troops advance inland? How much can be transported? What is the climate like? How much rainfall? What tropical diseases in that jungle area will attack the soldiers? Their report was comprehensive. They found that the region had almost none of the conveniences that modern forces like ours consider necessary to wage war. Its telecommunications, roads, railways—everything that makes it possible for a modern combat force to operate on the ground—almost didn't exist.

　　Its port facilities and airports were all unsuitable, and to provide the facilities we needed would require enormous engineering and logistical efforts.

　　The place was full of rice paddies and jungles—especially suitable for guerrilla warfare, which the Chinese soldiers are good at. This means that every small unit, every person who wants to operate in that country, must have riflemen for protection. Every telephone lineman, road repair crew, every ambulance, and every first aid station behind the front lines must have armed guards, otherwise they will be shot at every moment. If we really go to Indochina, we must win.

　　We must send an army capable in all respects, which means a very strong ground force—able to withstand the normal attrition of combat, as well as the enormous casualties caused by the jungle heat and the miasma and various tropical diseases that plague white people in the tropics. We dare not agree to anything that cannot achieve a decisive military victory.

　　We could have fought in Indochina. We could have won if we were willing to pay the huge price in personnel and money needed for such intervention. In my opinion, the cost would ultimately be as great as, or even greater than, what we paid in Korea.

　　The lesson we learned in Korea is that the Air Force and Navy alone cannot win a war, nor can it be won without sufficient ground troops.

　　What I find hard to believe is that we so quickly forgot that painful lesson—we were on the verge of making the same tragic mistake again.

　　Thank God, that mistake was not repeated.

　　After receiving the full report, I immediately circulated it through the chain of command. The report reached President Eisenhower. For someone with his military experience, the implications of the report were obvious. The idea of sending troops was abandoned, and I believe that the analysis made and submitted by the Army played a considerable, perhaps decisive, role in persuading our government not to undertake that tragic adventure. (The United States did not participate in that war at that time not because of Eisenhower's wisdom, but because the great victory of the Indochinese people made American imperialism afraid to act rashly.)

　　It is easy for people to imagine some moving tactical plans out of thin air. This is a game that any high school ROTC cadet can play, because it requires only a little military knowledge, and even career soldiers who have served for a long time and often participate in the same game can do it.

　　What causes you to fail in battle is rarely because your tactical plan is wrong—of course, although history is full of examples of wrong tactical plans—but because you have not thoroughly considered the logistical difficulties and harsh realities. You haven't asked yourself: "How do I move Army A from location X to location Y—and how do I supply and sustain it once it arrives there?"

　　People often can't help but think only about the goals to be achieved, neglecting the basic plan and hoping that God will take care of everything.

　　That wishful thinking dominated the early discussions about Indochina—in fact, it dominated until the Army went to the trouble of spending a lot of time and energy conducting field investigations, and then sat down to painstakingly write a written analysis revealing the full cost and implications of the matter. As I pointed out earlier in this memoir, the only thing I can be proud of when I one day report my actions to God is that I vehemently opposed, and perhaps even helped prevent, the implementation of certain reckless tactical plans that would have cost the lives of tens of thousands of people. On the list of those fortunate and unhappened tragic events, I will add the matter of sending troops to Indochina.

### 李奇微的一段回忆录

　　李奇微的一段回忆录
    一月三日一期的《美国新闻与世界报道》上登载了前侵朝美军司令、后来担任美国陆军参谋长的李奇微所写的回忆录中的一章，现把它摘译，并加批注发表如下：
    一九五四年春，当国防部集中最大的努力发展我们进行大规模原子打击的能力时，我们正处在非常接近于要卷入一场丛林血战的处境中，在这场战争里，我们的核能力几乎会一无用处。
    那时正有一支英勇的、主要由外籍军团的雇佣军组成的法国驻军——因为法国不想征募自己的年轻人去印度支那作战——在奠边府进行勇敢但又徒劳的抵抗。
    对熟悉印度支那地理的军事人员来说，那场攻城战的结果是一个预定的结局。战斗只能以一个方式结束——守卫者战死或被俘。作出要在奠边府打的决定并不是基于军事上的考虑。这基本上是由于政治上的动机——其目的是要支撑边界暴露于中国人挺进之前的摇摇欲坠的老挝。（法国殖民者当时在印度支那进行战争，是为了要维持它在这个地区的殖民统治，而李奇微却胡说什么中国要向老挝“挺进”。）
    不管在那个地方的抵抗和作战是多么徒劳无益，但是法国驻军艰苦作战的英勇精神还是震撼了全世界。（恰恰相反，是印度支那人民的胜利震撼了全世界。）不久我就十分不安地听到政府内外一些很有影响的人物掀起了这样的呼声：“试验新面貌政策”的时候现在已经来到，印度支那正是我们出兵来援助法国进行一试的地方。
    与此同时，又有人提出了过去那种虚妄的旧主张，说我们只要派空军和海军到印度支那就可以以低廉的代价而轻易地做到。
    对我来说，这是一个不祥之兆。因为我肯定地认为，如果我们派空军和海军到那个地区去，我们必须随即派出地面部队去支持。
    我还知道，那些主张采取这一步骤的人，对这样的行动要我们流出多少血、付出多少钱以及要全国作出多大的努力，心里一点底也没有。因此我感到，所有那些在对这一严重问题作出决定时能产生影响的人，都必须充分了解一切有关的因素。
    为了提供这些事实，我派出了一个由各方面专家组成的陆军小组到印度支那去，这个小组包括有工兵、信号和通讯兵、军医以及知道怎样根据作战战术的角度估计地势的有经验的战斗指挥员。他们是带着许许多多问题出发的，这些问题都是那些夸夸其谈地建议我们到那里去作战的人想也没有想到的。
    西贡外面河道里的水有多深？港口和码头的设备怎样？什么地方可以贮藏我们在那里所必需的大量军需品？公路网如何——在战斗部队开进内陆时军需品如何运输？能运多少？气候怎样？雨量多少？在那个丛林地带有些什么热带疾病会袭击战士们？他们的报告是全面的。他们发现，这个地区几乎不存在那些象我们这样的现代化部队认为发动战争所必需的便利条件。它的电讯，公路，铁路——一切使一支现代化战斗部队在地面上作战成为可能的东西——几乎都不存在。
    它的港口设施和机场全都不适用，而要提供我们所需要的设施就必须作出巨大的工程和后勤方面的努力。
    这块地方到处都是水稻田和丛林——特别适合于游击战，而打这种仗，中国兵是拿手。这就是说，每一支小部队、每一个人想要在那个国家行动的话，都必须有步枪射手的保护。每一个电话架线兵、修路队，每一辆救护车和每一个战线后方的急救站都必须有武装保卫，否则他们每时每刻都会受到射击。如果我们真的要去印度支那，我们就必须打赢。
    我们必须派一支各方面都能胜任的军队去，这就是说要有一支非常强大的地面部队——既能经受得住战斗的正常消耗，又能经受得住丛林的酷热以及在热带折磨白种人的瘴气和各种热病所造成的巨大伤亡。我们再也不敢同意任何不能取得决定性军事胜利的事情。
    我们本来是可以在印度支那作战的。如果我们愿意付出进行这种干涉所需要的人员和金钱方面的巨大代价，我们本来也是可以打赢的。在我看来，这个代价最终将会象我们在朝鲜所付出的那样大，甚至还会超过。
    我们在朝鲜得到的教训是，单靠空军和海军不能赢得一场战争，没有足够的地面部队也不能打赢。
    使我难以相信的是，我们这么快就忘记了那个惨痛教训——我们又处在犯同样悲剧性错误的边缘。
    感谢上帝，那个错误没有重犯。
    我收到了报告全文后就立即把它交给指挥部系统传阅。报告到了艾森豪威尔总统手里。对于一个有他这样的军事经验的人来说，报告的含意是一目了然的。出兵的想法放弃了，我相信，陆军所作出并提交上级的分析，在说服我们政府不要进行那种悲剧性的冒险方面起了一个相当大的、或许是决定性的作用。（美国当时没有参与那场战争，并不是因为艾森豪威尔的明智，而是因为印度支那人民的伟大胜利，使得美帝国主义不敢轻举妄动）。
    要人们凭空想象一些动人的战术计划是容易的。这是任何中学的后备军官训练队学员所能玩的一种游戏，因为这只要求一点点军事知识，甚至长期服役经常参加同样游戏的职业军人也能做到。
    在战斗中使你失败的很少是因为你的战术计划错了——当然，尽管历史不乏战术计划错误的例子——而是因为你没有周密地考虑到后勤方面的艰难冷酷的实际情况。你没有问问你自己：“我怎样把A军从X地调到Y地——在它一旦到达那里后我又怎样供给和维持它？”
    人们往往会情不自禁地只想到要取得的目标，忽视基本计划而抱着上帝总会安排的希望。
    那种主观愿望在关于印度支那问题讨论的初期一直占着上风——事实上，直到陆军不辞劳苦花了很多时间和精力去作了实地调查，然后坐下来吃力不讨好地写成书面分析揭示出这件事的全部代价和含意以前，这种主观愿望始终占着上风。正如我早先在这本回忆录中所指出的，当我有一天去向上帝报告我的行动时，我唯一能引以为自豪的事情是，我竭力反对了，也许还出了一份力来阻止某些会使成千上万人牺牲生命的轻率战术计划的实施。在那侥幸而没有发生的悲剧性事件的名单上，我将添上关于出兵印度支那这件事。
