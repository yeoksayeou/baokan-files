    This newspaper reports that on February 12th, the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened over 80 people, including secretaries of the Northwest Bureau Secretariat who were attending meetings in Xi'an, secretaries of the provincial and autonomous regional Party committees of the Northwest, secretaries of prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and county Party committees, and other responsible cadres, to study and discuss Comrade Jiao Yulu’s exemplary deeds.
    The meeting was presided over by Comrade Liu Lantao, First Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. Comrade Liu Lantao said that Comrade Jiao Yulu was a good student of Chairman Mao, an outstanding son of the Chinese people, a great communist fighter, and a good example for us to learn from. He called on all Party members, cadres, and revolutionaries, especially leading cadres at the county level and above, in the Northwest region to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example to transform their own thinking and better complete the tasks assigned by the Party.
    Comrade Liu Lantao requested all comrades working in the Northwest to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of thorough revolution and strong revolutionary will. He said that at present, the economy and culture of the Northwest region are still relatively backward compared to advanced regions in the country. However, the Party organizations in the Northwest region have a long and glorious history of revolutionary struggle, and the people of all ethnic groups in the Northwest are diligent and brave. We have deep revolutionary feelings for every mountain, river, grass, and tree in the Northwest. The path that Comrade Jiao Yulu and the people of Lankao County opened up in overcoming various difficulties is precisely the path we must take. To build the Northwest well, the most fundamental thing is to give prominence to politics, creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and place the study of Chairman Mao's works in the primary position of all work. If cadres and the masses are revolutionized, the socialist revolution in the Northwest region can be carried out even better, and the socialist construction in the Northwest region can develop by leaps and bounds.
    Comrade Liu Lantao proposed: (1) Party committees at all levels and all cadres should learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, and in connection with reality, conduct discussions, and study repeatedly and regularly. The deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu should be regarded as teaching materials for creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and for the cultivation of Communist Party members. (2) Through newspapers, periodicals, radio broadcasts, and various art forms, we must vigorously publicize the exemplary deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu to raise the class consciousness of the masses and inspire the revolutionary fighting spirit of the masses. (3) In the course of learning, we must take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example to examine our work, carry forward our strengths, overcome our shortcomings, and correct our mistakes. The important thing is to absorb revolutionary strength from it and transform it into everyone's practical actions.
    The comrades who attended the meeting used Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to examine their own thinking and work in their speeches. They believed that there was still a big gap between their various aspects and Comrade Jiao Yulu; they must conscientiously learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, and first of all, learn from his revolutionary spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly to transform their own world outlook. Zhang Ze, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, said that in learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we must first learn from his thorough revolutionary spirit of not seeking fame, not seeking profit, not fearing hardship, not fearing death, and serving the people wholeheartedly, and only by first learning his revolutionary spirit can we possibly learn other aspects. Hu Jizong, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, said that when Comrade Jiao Yulu first arrived in Lankao County, Lankao County faced many difficulties. However, Comrade Jiao Yulu believed that "Lankao is a place with great potential, the problem is to work and make revolution." Now, some people are afraid of "suffering," not only afraid of "suffering" in life, but also afraid of "suffering" in thought and spirit, afraid of making mistakes in work, "suffering losses," afraid of this and that, and have many worries. With this kind of "selfishness," one cannot have the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. This is a question of world outlook. Lü Jianren, Secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee Secretariat, said that Comrade Jiao Yulu is an example for county Party secretaries and an example for all revolutionary cadres. Comrades holding higher leadership positions should learn from him even more. We must honestly connect with reality, transform our thinking, improve our work style, and learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu with practical actions to do a good job. Ji Chunguang, Deputy Secretary of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, said: Through this study, we must re-recognize ourselves, educate ourselves, and, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, be good students of Chairman Mao.
    The comrades who spoke all said that in learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, it is also necessary to conscientiously learn from his deep class feelings of sharing weal and woe with the masses; learn from his work style of going deep among the masses, going deep into reality, conducting in-depth investigations and research, and grasping first-hand materials; learn from his work methods of coming from the masses and going to the masses; and learn from his leadership methods of vigorously grasping the revolutionization of people, grasping typical examples, and promoting work. Su Keqin, Secretary of the Xiahe County Party Committee in Gansu Province, said that Xiahe County is a region where Tibetan people live in concentrated communities, and the natural conditions are very good, with lush water and grass, and the people are diligent and brave. However, there has not yet appeared a scene of changing the world like that in Lankao County. This is mainly because myself and the county Party committee have not been as revolutionized as Comrade Jiao Yulu and the Lankao County Party Committee. We must, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, first grasp the ideological revolutionization of the leading core and cultivate a large number of communistized cadres of ethnic minorities for the Party.
    Everyone also said in unison in their speeches that to revolutionize their own thinking, they must creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works like Comrade Jiao Yulu. Zhuojia (Tibetan), Governor of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, said that in examining myself, I have not creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works like Comrade Jiao Yulu. I am an ethnic minority cadre, and the Party teaches us that ethnic minority cadres must be communistized, but I have not done enough myself. Comrade Jiao Yulu is a true communistized fighter, and I must learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu well.

    我们对西北的山水草木有深厚感情
    我们要学焦裕禄榜样把西北建设好
    中共中央西北局召集在西安的西北地区负责干部举行会议
    刘澜涛同志号召全区党员干部和一切革命者向焦裕禄学习
    本报讯　中共中央西北局二月十二日召集正在西安参加会议的西北局书记处书记，西北各省委、自治区党委，地、州委，县委书记和其他负责干部八十多人，学习和讨论焦裕禄同志的模范事迹。
    会议由中共中央西北局第一书记刘澜涛同志主持。刘澜涛同志说，焦裕禄同志是毛主席的好学生、是中国人民的优秀儿子，是共产主义的伟大战士，是我们学习的好榜样。他号召西北地区全体党员干部和一切革命者，特别是县以上领导干部，向焦裕禄同志学习，以焦裕禄同志为榜样，来改造自己的思想，更好地完成党交给的任务。
    刘澜涛同志要求在西北工作的全体同志，学习焦裕禄同志的彻底革命的精神和坚强的革命意志。他说，目前西北地区同全国先进地区比，经济和文化还比较落后。但是，西北地区的党组织有着长期的、光荣的革命斗争历史，西北的各族人民是勤劳而勇敢的。我们对于西北的一山一水、一草一木，都有着深厚的革命感情。焦裕禄同志和兰考县人民在克服各种困难中所开辟的道路，也正是我们要走的道路。要把西北建设好，最根本的是突出政治，活学活用毛泽东思想，把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首要地位。干部和群众革命化了，就可以使西北地区的社会主义革命搞得更好，使西北地区的社会主义建设飞跃地发展。
    刘澜涛同志提出：（一）各级党委和所有干部都要向焦裕禄同志学习，并且联系实际，进行讨论，而且要反复学、经常学。要把焦裕禄同志的事迹，当作活学活用毛泽东思想和共产党员修养的教材。（二）要通过报刊、广播和各种文艺形式，大力宣传焦裕禄同志的模范事迹，以提高群众的阶级觉悟，鼓舞群众的革命斗志。（三）在学习中，要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，来检查工作，发扬优点，克服缺点，改正错误。重要的是从中吸取革命力量，变为大家的实际行动。
    到会同志在发言中，都以焦裕禄同志为镜子，检查了自己的思想和工作。他们认为自己的各方面，与焦裕禄同志相比，还有很大差距；必须认真地向焦裕禄同志学习，首先要学习他完全地彻底地为人民服务的革命精神，来改造自己的世界观。中共陕西省委书记处书记章泽说，我们学习焦裕禄同志，首先要学习他那种不为名、不为利、不怕苦、不怕死、全心全意为人民服务的彻底革命精神，也只有首先学习他的革命精神，其他的方面才有可能学到手。中共甘肃省委书记处书记胡继宗说，焦裕禄同志初到兰考县的时候，兰考县有着重重困难。但是焦裕禄同志认为“兰考是个大有作为的地方，问题是要干，要革命。”现在，有些人就是怕“苦”，不仅怕生活上的“苦”，还怕思想上、精神上的“苦”，怕在工作中犯错误，“吃苦头”，怕这怕那，顾虑重重。有了这种“私”心，就不能有无产阶级大无畏的革命精神，这是个世界观的问题。新疆维吾尔自治区党委书记处书记吕剑人说，焦裕禄同志是县委书记的榜样，是一切革命干部的榜样，担负更高领导职务的同志更要向他学习。我们必须老老实实的联系实际，改造思想，改进作风，以做好工作的实际行动向焦裕禄同志学习。中共青海省委副书记冀春光说：我们通过这次学习，要重新认识自己、教育自己，象焦裕禄同志一样，做毛主席的好学生。
    发言的同志都说，向焦裕禄同志学习，还要认真学习他与群众同甘共苦的深厚阶级感情；学习他深入群众，深入实际，认真调查研究，掌握第一手材料的工作作风；学习他从群众中来，到群众中去的工作方法；学习他狠抓人的革命化，抓典型树样板推动工作的领导方法。中共甘肃省夏河县委书记苏克勤说，夏河县是藏族人民聚居的地区，自然条件很好，水草丰茂，人民勤劳勇敢。但现在还没有出现象兰考县那样改天换地的景象，这主要是自己和县委还没有焦裕禄同志和兰考县委那样革命化。我们一定要象焦裕禄同志那样首先抓领导核心的思想革命化，为党造就大量的少数民族共产主义化的干部。
    大家在发言中还异口同声地说，要使自己思想革命化，就必须向焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席著作。青海省海南藏族自治州州长卓加（藏族）说，检查自己，没有象焦裕禄同志那样活学活用毛主席著作。我是个少数民族干部，党教导我们少数民族干部要共产主义化，可是我自己做得不够，焦裕禄同志是真正的共产主义化的战士，我一定要好好向焦裕禄同志学习。
