Title: Bring into Play the Power of the Strategic and Tactical Thinking of People's War; Make the Enemy Dash Around, Either Missing Its Target or Taking a Beating.

    Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Saigon: News from Saigon: The U.S. invading forces launched a five-pronged offensive in the central coastal region of South Vietnam and near Saigon. In the past ten days or so, they have repeatedly come up empty. The heroic and resourceful South Vietnamese Liberation Army, employing the strategic and tactical thinking of people's war, has caused the enemy to dash around without finding a trace of the Liberation Army, while they themselves constantly seek favorable opportunities to strike the enemy.
    According to Western news agencies, the so-called "Masher offensive" launched by the U.S. First Cavalry Division in Binh Dinh province was met with a head-on blow by the Liberation Army from the start. From February 3rd, this offensive was renamed "White Wing offensive," and the combat force was increased to the size of a division. This batch of U.S. invading forces joined forces with more than 5,000 U.S. Marines who had moved south after their "Double Eagle offensive" in Quang Ngai province to the north had come up empty, attempting to concentrate their forces to "encircle and annihilate" the main force of the Liberation Army. However, since these two U.S. forces "joined forces" in the An Lao Valley in the liberated area of Binh Dinh province on the 6th, they have continued to come up empty.
    The Associated Press said that the U.S. "ground forces have not yet achieved anything in discovering the Viet Cong." United Press International, quoting a brigadier general named Moore from the U.S. First Cavalry Division, said that he was "disappointed" with the results of this large-scale military operation.
    According to U.S. news agencies on the 10th, the U.S. invading forces who were "disappointed" in An Lao Valley because they had come up empty, were in fact attacked by the Liberation Army. According to reports, shortly after these two U.S. invading forces "joined forces" in An Lao Valley, three U.S. special forces groups were wiped out by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army. These three special forces groups, touted by the U.S. military as "selected troops" and "the most resilient backbone," were left with only "two survivors." One of the survivors—the commander of these groups, Major Beckwith—is now lying in a hospital in the Philippines, "in serious condition, with sixteen bullet and shrapnel wounds."
    The U.S. 101st Airborne Division, which launched the "Van Buren offensive" in Phu Yen province, not only failed to hit the Liberation Army, but was instead constantly beaten. On the 7th, the Liberation Army attacked this U.S. invading force that was operating in the Tuy Hoa area of Phu Yen province.
    According to reports, the Liberation Army opened fire fiercely with light weapons when the enemy was less than fifty yards from their position, and then engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. United Press International said that in this battle, the U.S. military "suffered moderate casualties." On the 9th, the Liberation Army launched three more attacks on the U.S. 101st Airborne Division's troops, again causing casualties to the enemy.
    The U.S. First Infantry Division's "Pile Driver offensive" and "Attleboro offensive," after being thwarted, recently launched a so-called "Quick Kick IV offensive" 45 kilometers northwest of Saigon. Another batch of U.S. paratroopers, together with Australian puppet troops, launched a so-called "Operation Rolling Stone" in the vicinity of this area. However, because the Liberation Army employed intelligent and flexible tactics, the enemy repeatedly came up empty. "Operation Rolling Stone" has had to be declared stopped, while "Quick Kick IV offensive" has been declared a failure because it has "not killed or captured a single guerrilla" to this day.

    发挥人民战争战略战术的威力　使敌到处乱撞不是扑空就是挨打
    南越解放军再挫美军多路疯狂攻势
    美国第一步兵师在西贡附近发动两个新攻势也告失败
    新华社十一日讯　西贡消息：美国侵略军在南越中部沿海地区和西贡附近发动五路攻势，最近十多天来接连扑空，英勇机智的越南南方解放军运用人民战争的战略战术，使敌人到处乱撞却找不到解放军的踪影，而自己却不时寻找有利战机打击敌人。
    据西方通讯社报道，由美国第一骑兵师在平定省发动的所谓“捣碎机攻势”，由于一开始就受到解放军的迎头痛击，从二月三日起把这个攻势改名为
  “白翼攻势”，并且把作战力量增加到师的规模。这批美国侵略军同在北面广义省进行“双鹰攻势”扑空后向南移动的五千多名美国海军陆战队会师，妄图集中力量“围歼”解放军的主力。但是这两路美军从六日开始在平定省解放区的安老谷“会师”以来，继续扑空。
    美联社说，美国“地面部队在发现越共方面仍然没有什么成就”。合众国际社援引美国第一骑兵师的一个名叫穆尔的旅长的话说，他对于这次大规模军事行动的结果感到“失望”。
    据美国通讯社十日透露，正在安老谷因扑空而“失望”的美国侵略军，却受到了解放军的打击。据报道，这两路美国侵略军在安老谷“会师”后不久，就有三个美国特种部队小组被南越解放军一举歼灭。这三个被美军吹嘘为“精选的部队”、“最顽强的中坚力量”的特种部队小组只剩下“两个幸存者”。幸存者之一——这些小组的指挥官贝克威思少校现在躺在菲律宾的医院里，“情况严重，身上受子弹炮弹破片打伤有十六处之多”。
    在富安省发动“范布伦攻势”的美国第一○一空降师，不但打不着解放军，却反而不断挨打。解放军七日袭击了正在富安省绥和地区活动的这支美国侵略军。
    据报道，解放军在敌人离阵地不到五十码的时候，用轻武器进行猛烈射击，然后同敌人进行肉搏战。合众国际社说，在这次战斗中，美军“遭到中等程度的伤亡”。九日，解放军又对美国第一○一空降师的部队进行三次袭击，再次使敌人遭到伤亡。
    美国第一步兵师在西贡附近发动的“木槌攻势”和“鹿皮攻势”，在遭到挫败之后，最近又在西贡西北四十五公里发动了一个所谓“快踢四号攻势”，另外一批美国伞兵部队伙同澳大利亚仆从军在这个地区附近发动了一个所谓“圆屋攻势”。但是，由于解放军运用了机智灵活的战术，使敌人接连扑空，“圆屋攻势”已不得不宣布停止，而“快踢四号攻势”因至今“没有毙俘一名游击队”而宣告失败。
