    Belgian Communist Party Protests Belgian Authorities' Fascist Atrocities
    Calls on Workers to Inflict More Powerful Blows on Class Enemies
    Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, February 15th (Telegram) The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party issued a communique on the 11th, strongly protesting the Belgian authorities' unwarranted confiscation of the weekly "The Voice of the People" and the search of the Belgian Communist Party headquarters.
    The communique stated that a recent issue of the Belgian Communist Party's weekly "The Voice of the People" was confiscated on the 11th, and the Party Central Committee headquarters at 65, Palace Street, Third District, Brussels, as well as the offices of "The Voice of the People" weekly, were searched.
    The communique pointed out that the anti-people and nation-betraying government is afraid of the truth. The leadership of the Party and the leadership of "The Voice of the People" weekly lodge the strongest protest against these police measures, which prominently demonstrate the fascization of a regime in distress. The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party called on Belgian workers to inflict even more powerful blows on the enemies of the working class.

    新华社布鲁塞尔十五日电　比利时共产党中央委员会书记处十一日发表公报，强烈抗议比利时当局无理没收《人民之声》周刊和搜查比共中央所在地。
    公报说，最近出版的一期比利时共产党《人民之声》周刊十一日被没收，布鲁塞尔第三区宫廷街六十五号党中央所在地以及《人民之声》周刊的办公室被搜查。
    公报指出，反人民的和背叛民族的政府是害怕真理的。党的领导和《人民之声》周刊的领导对这种警察措施提出最强烈的抗议，这种措施突出地表明了一个陷入困境的政权的法西斯化。比共中央书记处号召比利时工人给予工人阶级的敌人以更加强有力的打击。
