Communist Youth League cadres shoulder the important task of leading the broad masses of young people to play a role in the three great revolutionary movements and realize revolutionization.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, February 11) The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued a notice on the 10th, requesting the vast number of cadres in the Northwest region to earnestly learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu. The notice said that now on all fronts across the country, the glorious heroic deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, former secretary of the Lankao County Committee of the CPC, are being praised.
