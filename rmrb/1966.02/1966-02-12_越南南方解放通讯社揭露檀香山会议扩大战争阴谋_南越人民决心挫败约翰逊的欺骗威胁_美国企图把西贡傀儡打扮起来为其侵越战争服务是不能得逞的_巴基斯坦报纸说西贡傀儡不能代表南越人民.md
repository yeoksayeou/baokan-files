    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 10th -- The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency issued a commentary on the 10th, severely criticizing the Honolulu Conference recently held by the head of U.S. imperialism and his Saigon running dogs, and the so-called "Honolulu Declaration" issued at the conference. The commentary pointed out that no deception or blackmail by the Johnson clique can stop the South Vietnamese people's determination to thwart all actions by U.S. imperialism to escalate the war.

    The commentary said that the head of the U.S. aggressors summoned their Saigon running dogs to Hawaii to receive instructions and then issued the so-called "Honolulu Declaration." Despite some lengthy and roundabout sophistry in this "Declaration," one point is very clear: that is, U.S. imperialism still intends to continue to intensify and expand the war of aggression in South Vietnam. Westmoreland requested the U.S. government to send 200,000 more U.S. troops to South Vietnam, and at the same time proposed a five-point plan to intensify "mopping up" and "pacification" in South Vietnam and continue bombing the North. U.S. imperialism has thus exposed itself as the aggressor in South Vietnam.

    The commentary said that Washington's conspiracy to dress up the Saigon puppet clique to serve its war of aggression in Vietnam will not succeed. The prestige and position of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front are growing day by day in the international arena. The broad masses of people all over the world have recognized it as the only true representative of the 14 million people of South Vietnam, and recognize that it has a decisive say in resolving the Vietnam issue. The traitorous faces of the U.S. running dogs Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky have been completely exposed.

    The commentary pointed out that through the "Honolulu Declaration," people can also clearly see that the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to "pacify" South Vietnam is aimed at attacking the South Vietnamese people's liberation movement, driving residents into concentration camps, plundering the people's property, and establishing and expanding military bases, thereby preparing for the arrival of more and more U.S. expeditionary forces.

    The commentary concluded that all the deceptive conspiracies and threatening tactics adopted by Johnson and his clique have been exposed by the South Vietnamese people and the people of the world. The South Vietnamese people will never shrink back and are determined to defeat any action by U.S. imperialism to intensify the war, liberate the South, defend the North, and then reunify the motherland.

    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, February 10th -- The Karachi *Star* wrote in an editorial on the 9th condemning the Honolulu Conference: The United States is talking lavishly about "peace" on the one hand, while waging a cruel and barbarous war in Vietnam; it is talking lavishly about "freedom" on the one hand, while supporting a tyrannical puppet regime in South Vietnam.

    The editorial condemned Johnson's decision to step up the bombing of North Vietnam and further escalate U.S. military operations in South Vietnam.

    The editorial asked: "Why does the United States insist on waging this evil war on a remote land?"

    The editorial refuted Johnson's claim that the United States is fighting for the "freedom" and "independence" of South Vietnam, pointing out that the South Vietnamese puppet regime under U.S. control is carrying out a brutal and corrupt police rule. The United States has violated the 1954 Geneva Accords. It obstructs the peaceful reunification of Vietnam.

    The *Unity* newspaper of East Pakistan said in an editorial on the 8th: "Unless the United States decides to withdraw its troops from Vietnam, no threats, persuasion or negotiations will help to achieve peace there."

    The editorial said that those "so-called South Vietnamese leaders - actually U.S. running dogs - summoned to Honolulu to attend the meeting cannot represent the South Vietnamese people." (Attached picture)

    越南南方解放通讯社揭露檀香山会议扩大战争阴谋
    南越人民决心挫败约翰逊的欺骗威胁
    美国企图把西贡傀儡打扮起来为其侵越战争服务是不能得逞的
    巴基斯坦报纸说西贡傀儡不能代表南越人民
    新华社河内十日电　越南南方解放通讯社十日发表评论，严厉抨击美帝国主义头子及其西贡走狗最近举行的檀香山会议和发表的所谓“檀香山宣言”。评论指出，约翰逊集团的任何欺骗和讹诈都阻挡不了越南南方人民挫败美帝国主义一切加剧战争行动的决心。
    评论说，美国侵略者的头子把他们的西贡走狗召到夏威夷去面授指示以后发表了所谓“檀香山宣言”。尽管这个“宣言”作了一些冗长的、转弯抹角的诡辩，但有一点是很明显的：那就是美帝国主义仍然是要在越南南方继续加强和扩大侵略战争。威斯特摩兰要求美国政府再增派二十万美军到南越，他同时提出了一个要在南越加紧“扫荡”和“绥靖”以及继续对北方进行轰炸的五点计划。美帝国主义就这样暴露了自己是越南南方的侵略者。
    评论说，华盛顿妄图把西贡傀儡集团打扮起来为其侵越战争服务的阴谋是不能得逞的。越南南方民族解放阵线在国际上的威信和地位正在与日俱增。全世界广大的人民群众已经承认它是越南南方一千四百万人民的唯一真正代表，并且承认它在解决越南问题方面有着决定性的发言权。而美国的走狗阮文绍—阮高其的卖国面目已经暴露无遗。
    评论指出，通过“檀香山宣言”，人们还清楚地看到，美帝国主义玩弄“绥靖”越南南方的阴谋，目的是为了打击越南南方人民的解放运动，把居民赶入集中营，掠夺人民的财产，建立和扩大军事基地，从而为越来越多的美国远征军的到来作好准备。
    评论最后说，约翰逊及其集团采取的一切欺骗阴谋和威胁手段已经被越南南方人民和世界人民所揭穿。越南南方人民决不畏缩，决心打败美帝国主义强化战争的任何行动，解放南方，保卫北方，进而重新统一祖国。
    新华社拉瓦尔品第十日电卡拉奇《明星晚报》九日在一篇谴责檀香山会议的社论中写道：美国一面侈谈“和平”，一面在越南进行残酷野蛮的战争；一面侈谈“自由”，一面在南越支持一个暴虐的傀儡政权。
    社论谴责约翰逊加紧对越南北方进行轰炸，并且把美国在越南南方的军事行动进一步升级的决定。
    社论问道：“美国为什么坚持要在一个遥远的国土上进行这场罪恶的战争？”
    社论在驳斥约翰逊所谓美国是在为南越的“自由”和“独立”而战的说法时指出，在美国控制下的南越伪政权是进行残暴和腐败的警察统治。美国破坏了一九五四年日内瓦协议。它阻挠越南的和平统一。
    东巴基斯坦《团结报》八日的社论说：“除非美国决定从越南撤军，任何威胁、劝说和谈判都无助于在那里实现和平。”
    社论说，那些奉召到檀香山开会的“所谓南越领导人——实际上是美国的走狗——不能代表南越人民。”（附图片）
