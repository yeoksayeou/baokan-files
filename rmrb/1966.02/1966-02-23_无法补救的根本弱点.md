　　The Irredeemable Fundamental Weakness
　　He Zhuo
    The U.S. military and political heads have recently been clamoring for expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, with a fierce and menacing air. U.S. President Johnson declared that the U.S. "will provide manpower to the extent and requirements used by General Westmoreland." U.S. Defense Secretary McNamara even shouted loudly that in South Vietnam, "(the U.S.) will provide as many troops as needed." In short, they openly stated that the U.S. is determined to continue the war of aggression against Vietnam at any cost.
    There is no doubt that the Johnson administration is determined to continue "gradual escalation" in the war of aggression against Vietnam. However, how much capital does U.S. imperialism actually have for aggression? Can it really, as Johnson and McNamara say, fight as long as it wants in South Vietnam and provide as many troops as it needs? Many American bourgeois newspapers have expressed doubt about this. The article published by the famous American military commentator Baldwin in the *New York Times* discussing the inadequacy of the U.S. armed forces is very telling.
    U.S. imperialism mainly relies on airplanes, artillery, tanks, and atomic bombs as tools for aggression. This is its so-called "deterrence policy." When the people being invaded are not intimidated by these tricks and dare to rise up and use people's war to deal with it, the fundamental weakness of U.S. imperialism's lack of troops will immediately be exposed. In such a small battlefield as South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism already finds it difficult to cope.
    U.S. imperialism is a behemoth, how can it be short of troops?
    Indeed, the United States has nearly three million armed forces, which seems quite impressive. However, U.S. imperialism has a very large appetite for aggression, so its forces have to be dispersed around the world. It wants to control Western Europe; it wants to occupy South Korea; it wants to intervene in the Dominican Republic; it has to guard military bases all over the world; it wants to maintain suppression forces within the United States. In a word, it wants to play the role of "world policeman," and it wants to suppress any national liberation movement and people's revolutionary struggle. U.S. imperialism has stretched its line of aggression so long that it has to divide its forces, how can it not be stretched thin? Therefore, it is not surprising that the United States is already struggling to increase its troops in Vietnam to 200,000 today.
    In order to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. imperialism can of course draw some troops from other places to the South Vietnam battlefield. However, this method of robbing Peter to pay Paul cannot but disrupt the U.S.'s counter-revolutionary global strategic deployment, and its room for maneuver is also limited. Some American bourgeois newspapers have long raised this question: What will the United States do if another South Vietnam emerges?
    The Johnson administration is expanding conscription at home and stepping up the search for cannon fodder. However, it has encountered extreme difficulties in exhausting its manpower. More and more American youths are unwilling to go to Vietnam to die. Johnson can only lower his standards. The combat effectiveness of the army cobbled together under such circumstances of simply filling numbers can be imagined.
    U.S. imperialism is already in a state of extreme embarrassment on the South Vietnam battlefield, and the Johnson administration still intends to expand the war to the entire Indochina and even to China. Isn't it a bit too presumptuous? South Vietnam has only 14 million people, and the United States cannot handle it with 200,000 troops. China has nearly fifty times more people than South Vietnam. If U.S. imperialism insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, it would need at least fifty times the number of troops. To be honest, our vast ocean of people's war can completely accommodate a few million invading troops.

　　无法补救的根本弱点
　　何卓
    美国的军政头目最近纷纷发出扩大侵越战争的叫嚣，气势汹汹，凶恶得很。美国总统约翰逊声言，美国“将按照威斯特摩兰将军使用的限度和要求提供兵员”。美国国防部长麦克纳马拉更是大叫大嚷，在南越“需要多少部队（美国）就拿出多少部队”。总之，他们是公开表示，美国决心不惜工本地把侵越战争打下去。
    约翰逊政府决意在侵越战争中继续“逐步升级”，这是没有问题的。但是，美帝国主义究竟有多少侵略的本钱呢？它是否真的可以象约翰逊、麦克纳马拉之流所说的那样，在南越要打多久就打多久，要多少部队就拿出多少部队呢？这连美国的许多资产阶级报刊也表示怀疑。美国著名的军事评论员鲍德温在《纽约时报》上发表的论述美国武装部队不足的文章，就是很能说明问题的。
    美帝国主义主要是靠飞机、大炮、坦克、原子弹作为进行侵略的工具。这就是它所谓的“威慑政策”。当被侵略的人民不为它的这些名堂所吓倒，敢于起来用人民战争对付它的时候，美帝国主义兵力不足的根本弱点就马上要暴露出来。南越这样一个小小的战场，美帝国主义已经感到难以应付了。
    美帝国主义是一个庞然大物，怎么会兵力不足呢？
    不错，美国拥有近三百万的武装部队，看来是蛮象样的。但是，美帝国主义的侵略胃口大得很，因此它的兵力就不能不分散在世界各地。西欧，它要控制；南朝鲜，它要占领；多米尼加，它要干涉；遍布全球的军事基地，它要把守；美国国内，它要保持镇压的力量。一句话，它要扮演“世界宪兵”的角色，哪里有民族解放运动和人民革命斗争，它都要镇压。美帝国主义把侵略战线拉得那末长，不得不分兵把口，怎能不捉襟见肘呢？因此，美国今天把侵越军队增加到二十万已经大为吃力，这是毫不奇怪的。
    美帝国主义为了进一步扩大侵越战争，当然还可以从其他地方抽调一些军队到南越战场上去。但是，这种挖西墙补东墙的办法，不能不使美国的反革命全球战略部署乱了套，而且回旋余地也是有一定限度的。美国的一些资产阶级报刊早就提出这样一个问题：再出一个南越，美国怎么办？
    约翰逊政府正在国内扩大征兵，加紧搜罗炮灰。但是，它已经碰到兵源枯竭的极大困难。越来越多的美国青年不愿去越南送命。约翰逊只能降格以求。在这种滥竽充数的情况下拼凑起来的军队，其战斗力如何是可以想见的。
    美帝国主义在南越战场上已经弄得焦头烂额了，约翰逊政府还打算把战争扩大到整个印度支那、甚至扩大到中国来，不是有点太不自量力了吗？越南南方只有一千四百万人，美国用了二十万军队还招架不了；中国比南越人口多将近五十倍，如果美帝国主义硬要把战争强加到中国人民头上，那就至少非有五十倍的兵力不行。老实说，我们人民战争的汪洋大海，来个一千几百万侵略军，是完全容纳得下的。
