　　Japanese Militarism Is Stirring
　　By Our Staff Commentator
    Japanese militarism is stirring. While the Sato government intensifies its arms expansion and war preparations domestically, it is also making every effort to prepare for sending troops abroad to invade Asia. Not long ago, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Navy, Tomoharu Nishimura, blatantly clamored: "The Asian situation is extremely turbulent. In the event of something happening, the 'Self-Defense Forces' should rush to the battlefield immediately upon command." Recently, Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina openly declared in the House of Representatives that Japan has reached the point where it "should specifically discuss and study" sending troops abroad.
    The fact that Japanese militarists are currently stepping up their planning to send troops abroad is clearly a concrete step to cooperate with U.S. imperialism in intensifying its aggressive policies and war policies in Asia, and it is also a vain attempt to realize its sinister ambitions for foreign expansion.
    For a long time, the reactionary Japanese government has followed U.S. imperialism, tightly tying Japan to the U.S. aggressive chariot. The Sato government has consistently supported the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam and has, in effect, gradually involved Japan in this dirty war waged by U.S. imperialism in Asia. Under the direction of the United States, the Sato government signed the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," plotted the "Northeast Asia Military Group," and even drafted the "Three Arrows Plan" and the "Flying Dragon Plan" for attacking the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China. Especially now, as U.S. imperialism is shifting the focus of its counter-revolutionary global strategy from Europe to the Far East and directing its main aggressive spearhead at China, it further regards Japan as an important tool for its aggression in Asia. U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara recently openly stated that Japanese militarism is "indispensable" to the United States in pursuing its counter-revolutionary global strategy in Asia. At the same time, in order to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is eagerly demanding that its vassal states provide cannon fodder. At this time, Japanese militarism is eagerly clamoring to send troops abroad, obviously to serve the U.S. aggressive policies and war policies.
    The Japanese militarists' arrogant demand to send troops abroad, openly violating the Japanese Constitution's provisions on renouncing war, is also another blatant trampling on the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration. In order to deceive public opinion, the Sato government is fabricating a "Cooperation with the United Nations Bill," according to which Japan can "provide troops, labor, military supplies, airports, ports and other bases, and undertake the transportation of military supplies" when the "United Nations" decides to use "coercive military measures." The Japanese militarists are trying to use the banner of the United Nations as a legal basis for sending troops abroad. However, this method is completely futile. Everyone knows that the United Nations has long become an instrument of aggression for U.S. imperialism. Participating in the "United Nations Forces" is actually participating in the U.S. imperialist aggression army. The Japanese reactionaries' attempt to use the United Nations as a cover for sending troops abroad cannot conceal the heinous nature of Japanese militarism's expansion and aggression through sending troops abroad.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "Slaves who wholeheartedly allow U.S. imperialism to lead them by the nose will ultimately be buried with U.S. imperialism." U.S. imperialism has suffered repeated disastrous defeats in its aggressive activities in Asia and has fallen into a desperate and overwhelmed situation. The Japanese reactionaries still want to act as pawns of U.S. imperialism's aggression and attempt to gain some advantage from it. The reactionary actions of the Japanese reactionaries will never have a good outcome, and in the end, they will only end up with the shameful fate of being buried with U.S. imperialism!

### 日本军国主义蠢蠢欲动

　　日本军国主义蠢蠢欲动
　　本报评论员
    日本军国主义正在蠢蠢欲动。佐藤政府在国内加紧扩军备战的同时，还竭力为派兵出国侵略亚洲进行准备。不久前，日本海军参谋长西村友晴露骨地叫嚷：“亚洲形势极为动荡，万一发生事情，‘自卫队’就应该一声令下立即奔赴战场。”最近，日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎在众议院又公然宣称，日本已经到了“应当具体地讨论、研究”向国外派遣军队的时候。
    日本军国主义者在目前加紧策划派兵出国，显然是为了配合美帝国主义在亚洲加紧推行侵略政策和战争政策的一个具体步骤，并妄图实现它对外扩张的罪恶野心。
    长期以来，日本反动政府追随美帝国主义，把日本紧紧地拴在美国的侵略战车上。佐藤政府一贯支持美国侵略越南的战争，而且在实际上已经使日本逐步卷入了美帝国主义在亚洲进行的这场肮脏战争。佐藤政府在美国的指使下，签订了
  “日韩条约”，策划“东北亚军事集团”，甚至还拟定了进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中国的“三矢计划”和“飞龙计划”。特别在目前，美帝国主义正在把它的反革命全球战略的重心从欧洲移到远东，把它的主要侵略矛头指向中国，因而进一步把日本看作它侵略亚洲的重要工具。美国国防部长麦克纳马拉最近就公开声称，日本军国主义对美国在亚洲推行它的反革命全球战略是“必不可缺的”。同时美帝国主义为了进一步扩大侵越战争，迫不及待地要求仆从国家提供炮灰。在这个时候，日本军国主义跃跃欲试地叫嚷要派兵出国，显然是为了要给美国侵略政策和战争政策效劳。
    日本军国主义者狂妄地要向国外派兵，公然破坏了日本宪法关于放弃战争的规定，也是再一次对波茨坦公告的精神的粗暴践踏。为了欺骗舆论，佐藤政府正在制造一个“与联合国合作法案”，据此，日本可以在“联合国”决定使用“强制的军事措施”时，“提供兵员、劳动力、军事物资、飞机场、港湾和其他基地，以及担负军事物资的运输。”日本军国主义者企图打出联合国的招牌，作为派兵出国的法律根据。但是，这种手法完全是徒劳的。谁都知道，联合国早已成为美帝国主义的一个侵略工具。参加“联合国军”，实际上就是参加美帝国主义的侵略军。日本反动派想抬出联合国为它派兵出国打掩护，绝不能掩盖日本军国主义向外派兵进行扩张和侵略的罪恶本质。
    毛泽东同志指出，“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”美帝国主义在亚洲进行侵略活动已经连遭惨败，陷入焦头烂额、走投无路的困境。日本反动派还想充当美帝国主义的侵略走卒，并企图从中捞取什么便宜。日本反动派的倒行逆施，是决不会有好结果的，最后只会落个为美帝国主义殉葬的可耻下场！
