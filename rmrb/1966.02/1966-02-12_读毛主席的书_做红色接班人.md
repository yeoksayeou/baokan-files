    Reading Chairman Mao's Books, Becoming a Red Successor
    Xiao Ping, Platoon Leader of a Unit of the Beijing Military Region

    Comrade Xiao Ping is the descendant of revolutionary cadres, growing up under the red flag. However, having had little contact with the worker-peasant masses from a young age, lacking the tempering of labor and arduous life, he still possessed the weaknesses of a typical intellectual. After graduating from senior high school, he joined the army. In the army, he creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, resolved ideological problems, and grew into a red revolutionary fighter. Comrade Xiao Ping's growth process demonstrates that even children of revolutionary cadres, with good backgrounds, still need to constantly transform their thinking with Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon in the three great revolutionary movements, firmly establish a proletarian worldview, and only then can they become red successors.

    Personal Ideals and the Needs of the Motherland

    Before joining the army, I was a student at Beijing No. 47 Middle School, graduating in June 1962. While in school, I received the Beijing Middle School Student Excellence Medal and was named a "Three-Good" student, earning straight As in all subjects. Teachers and classmates suggested that I continue my studies; I had also aspired to pursue cutting-edge science since childhood. Just then, news came that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was plotting to invade the mainland. Going to university was a long-held ideal, but going to the front lines was the motherland's urgent need. What should I do? Later, I realized that I was a Red Army descendant, born in the flames of war and raised under the red flag. I should stand up when the country's security was threatened. Otherwise, how could I talk about personal ideals if the country wasn't at peace? So, I joined the army with the aspiration of killing enemies and earning merit.

    Unexpectedly, the leadership did not send me to the front lines but asked me to engage in agricultural and sideline production. My enthusiasm instantly cooled down. I couldn't go to the front lines, and I missed out on university. How wonderful it would be if I could work on cutting-edge science! I always felt that it was a bit of a "waste of talent" for an excellent student to be a "production soldier." So, I used my spare time to review math, science, and foreign languages to lay a foundation for future exams. The political instructor saw through my thoughts and told me to read Chairman Mao's books more to improve my ideological consciousness. After rereading articles like "Serve the People" and "On Coalition Government," my thinking was shaken. I thought, Chairman Mao said that everything should be subordinate to the needs of the people's interests. If the people need me to fight, I will pick up a gun and go to the front lines; if the people need me to produce, I will pick up a hoe and go to produce. Serving the people wholeheartedly is my greatest ideal. But why didn't I think this way before? After some reflection, I realized that I hadn't let go of the burden of being "from a good background and highly educated." My body had joined the army, but my mind hadn't. At this time, my father also wrote to me, advising me: "A revolutionary fighter, in any situation, must put the interests of the Party and the people first, consciously obey the needs of the revolution, remember Chairman Mao's teaching of serving the people wholeheartedly, and be prepared to sacrifice everything for the interests of the people at any time." This letter reminded me of a story my parents told me: In the spring of 1943, when I was only forty days old, we were surrounded by the enemy on our way to Yan'an. The situation was extremely critical, and it was very inconvenient to carry me. My mother worried that I would delay the revolutionary cause and wanted to leave me with the villagers. When the uncles found out, they all anxiously said, "You can't abandon him! This is a descendant of the revolution!" They took turns carrying me through the encirclement, and some uncles sacrificed their lives so that we could escape danger. Thinking of this, I felt sad. Was I the kind of selfish descendant the uncles expected? Was there any personal interest that could not be sacrificed when the revolution needed it? Personal ideals can only be the needs of the Party, the interests of the people, and the expectations of revolutionary elders. After understanding this, I immediately reported to the secretary of the Youth League branch and the deputy political instructor, determined to study Chairman Mao's works diligently and be a good ordinary soldier. Soon, I was praised by the company as a model soldier with a correct attitude toward service. This made me deeply feel that ideals must blossom towards the sunlight of communism and grow in the soil of the motherland's needs. Only in this way can they bear abundant fruit.

    False Integration and True Integration

    I had learned Chairman Mao's teachings about intellectuals integrating with the worker-peasant masses in school, but truly implementing them into my actions involved an ideological struggle from the superficial to the deep, from the false to the true. When I first arrived in the army, I thought that living, working, and training with worker-peasant comrades was integration. But the problem arose here: I always felt that I couldn't truly connect with worker-peasant comrades in my heart. One day, during a tactical exercise, it was very cold, but squad leader Feng Heidan insisted that I take off my yarn gloves. I thought he didn't care about people at all! After the exercise, he gave me his new cotton gloves. I thought: "Since you're not afraid of the cold, I'll wear them!" Later, I discovered that Feng Heidan's hands were so frozen that he couldn't even hold his rice bowl. This scene touched my heart, making me realize that when he asked me to take off my gloves, it was out of practical considerations, urging me to practice hard the skills to kill the enemy. Wasn't this true love for me? After the exercise, he would rather freeze himself but gave me the cotton gloves. Wasn't this true class feeling? The facts educated me that truly integrating with the worker-peasant comrades in thought and feeling involves a question of standpoint. If the bourgeois worldview in one's mind is not removed and replaced with a proletarian worldview, one will never have the same standpoint and feelings as worker-peasant soldiers, and even the strengths of worker-peasant comrades will be seen as shortcomings. I carefully analyzed myself and realized that I was still carrying the burden of superiority and hadn't shed my pretentious airs. I only saw the positive aspects of being raised under the Party's nurturing, constantly influenced by revolutionary thought, and actively participating in the revolution. I didn't see that I had little contact with workers and peasants from a young age, lacked the tempering of labor and arduous life, and was easily influenced by bourgeois ideology. From Chairman Mao's teaching that "the final demarcation between revolutionary, non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing and actually integrate with the worker and peasant masses," I realized that how well I integrated with worker-peasant comrades was an important indicator of how well I transformed my thinking. So, I secretly resolved to make myself revolutionary and must honestly workerize and peasantize myself.

    Although I had the desire to learn from workers and peasants, truly integrating still required a difficult journey, even painful training. True integration cannot be achieved without sweating profusely and enduring hardship. One day, we were transporting sorghum spikes, each bundle weighing twenty or thirty pounds, including mud and water, and the journey was two or three *li*. I gritted my teeth and carried three bundles. The road was muddy, each step sinking, and I couldn't hold on after walking far. My shoulders ached, my back was sore, and it seemed like I couldn't even breathe. I really wanted to drop a bundle; anyway, carrying two bundles would meet the requirements. But I didn't dare drop the state's grain. The ideological struggle became more and more intense. Then I looked up and saw the squad leader carrying four bundles and walking strongly. The squad leader's image reminded me of Chairman Mao's teaching: "No difficulty can hinder the progress of man, as long as one struggles and persists, the difficulties will be driven away." Yes, isn't every victory achieved by overcoming difficulties? The more critical the moment, the more one must learn from workers and peasants and overcome "student habits." I gritted my teeth and persevered. Later, I sometimes carried four bundles, and finally caught up with the veteran comrades. Although the labor was hard, I tasted the joy of labor and the happiness of struggle for the first time.

    Winter training began, and the temperature dropped to minus twenty degrees Celsius. This was a good opportunity to practice killing skills. On the day of the tactical exercise, the weather was even colder. Facing the cold wind, we jumped over low walls, passed through barbed wire fences, blew up bunkers one by one, and after repeated battles over the position, we were exhausted when we rushed to the bottom of the cliff. Grabbing the climbing rope, I hesitated a bit, wanting to go around. But thinking that this was "war," I started to climb. My hands were numb with cold. I lost my grip and slipped down. Looking back at the deep ditch, the ideological struggle became more intense. Should I go up or down? Looking up, I saw the slogan "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory" and saw that Wang Genshan, who came from a peasant family, had already reached the top. I want to learn from him! So I climbed again and finally climbed the six-*zhang*-high cliff, completing the exercise mission and receiving praise from the leaders and comrades. Although the skin of all ten fingers peeled off afterward, it enhanced a layer of class feeling. From this, I got a revelation: Integrating with worker-peasant comrades and transforming non-proletarian ideology is like climbing a cliff. Although the road is difficult, as long as you have sincerity and dare to strain your muscles and bones and temper your thoughts, you will always reach the top.

    Endpoint and Starting Point

    At the beginning of last year, I was rated as an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works by my unit, awarded a second-class merit, and went to Beijing four times to meet Chairman Liu, Premier Zhou, and other central leaders. The Party and the people have given me great honor and encouragement, which is a good thing; but it also presented me with a new question: Should I regard honor as a starting point and continue to move forward? Or should I regard honor as an end point and stop moving forward?

    Every time I reported my learning experience to my comrades, I heard enthusiastic applause. At first, I thought that the comrades were applauding my progress, and I felt a little sweet. Later, I studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "modesty helps one to progress, while conceit makes one lag behind" and felt that I was a little complacent in the face of honor. At this time, my father also promptly wrote to remind me. He said, "To study Chairman Mao's works well, one must have a humble and honest attitude and constantly guard against satisfaction and pride." His words aroused my vigilance: I must not be arrogant. Every progress I make is the result of Mao Zedong Thought's nurturing. The comrades applauded because they saw the great power of Mao Zedong Thought through my growth. That was applause for the great Mao Zedong Thought. From thinking that the applause was for "me" to thinking that it was for Mao Zedong Thought was a process of ideological struggle and the result of clarifying the source of the achievements.

    Praise and criticism are two touchstones for testing whether a person regards honor as a starting point or as an end point. In the face of praise and criticism, one must take conforming to the people's interests as the standard, master the weapon of one dividing into two, be good at discovering one's shortcomings from praise, and examine the reasons for the shortcomings from criticism. Once, I went to a fraternal unit to introduce my learning experience. After the meeting, a leader patted me on the shoulder and said, "You can be a very good revolutionary successor!" I felt that this placed a very high demand on me. After returning to the company, I studied the five conditions for revolutionary successors proposed by Chairman Mao and checked myself against them, finding that I was still far from meeting them. From then on, I paid attention to using these five conditions to strictly demand myself and treat them as the direction for transforming myself. Another time, during the initial evaluation of "Four Good," all the comrades in the company unanimously rated me as a "Five Good" soldier. Zhang He, a soldier from the rocket launcher squad, gave me a suggestion at the soldiers' meeting. He said, "I agree with rating Xiao Ping as 'Five Good,' but he is usually a little aloof and doesn't like to talk to people. I hope he can correct this." I was very happy to hear this suggestion, which shows that the masses have high demands on me and hope that I can unite more broadly with comrades and integrate with the masses. I really haven't done this and should strive to improve. These two things made me deeply realize that one must adopt an analytical attitude towards praise, be good at discovering one's less obvious and less prominent problems from it, and seriously solve them, preventing praise from becoming the beginning of regression. One must adopt a welcoming attitude towards criticism, humbly listen to all kinds of criticism, learn to draw inferences from one instance, and turn criticism into the beginning of progress. Only in this way can one often see one's own shortcomings, and one will neither be knocked down by praise nor overwhelmed by criticism.

    When a person is in an advanced position, should he learn from ordinary comrades? Our answer is affirmative. Every comrade in our class has his own advantages. When Qin Dengtian's child died, his work was not affected at all, and he could treat it correctly. I learned from his quality of valuing revolutionary interests. Zhao Chengyong was not rated as a "Five Good" soldier, but he was not discouraged and was determined to form a red pair with me. I learned from his revolutionary spirit towards honor. No matter which comrade's advantages, I wrote them in my notebook and kept them in my heart. In our team, there is no one who is unworthy of learning, only those who are not humble. There is no one without shortcomings, and there is no one without strengths. When you are arrogant, you will see even greatness as ordinary; when you are humble, you can see greatness even from the ordinary. As a revolutionary, one must be attentive, good at learning the extraordinary truth from the daily words and deeds of ordinary comrades. No matter who it is, as long as you have the truth, I will learn from you. Two things educated me the most. One was that a comrade in the class broke a rake, so I made a self-criticism to the tool keeper, Comrade Xi Buting, for not being strong enough in my sense of responsibility. Comrade Xi Buting said, "Breaking things is not enough to just come to criticize yourself!" I saw that he was very unhappy and felt helpless, so I said, "Otherwise, I'll pay you for one!" Who knew that this made him even angrier. He said, "You just say pay, pay, haven't you thought about who you're paying?" I felt very uncomfortable at the time. But after thinking about it: Why was he so unbearable to hear the word "pay"? Why did I say it so easily? Thinking about it, I found that the word "pay" was like a mirror, reflecting the ideological gap between me and Xi Buting. Damaging a rake may be a small matter, and a word "pay" is not difficult to say, but it exposed that I was not completely dissolving "me" into the collective, treating the collective cause and public property with the attitude of a master. Later, I organized the whole class to study Chairman Mao's teachings on building the country with diligence and thrift and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, improved our understanding, and everyone cherished and maintained tools, eliminating the phenomenon of damaging tools.

    Another thing was that when building a wall, a mud brick protruded slightly. I thought that as long as the top brick was aligned, it wouldn't matter. However, Squad Leader Li Cunxi of the Seventh Squad insisted on tearing it down and rebuilding it. He paid great attention to quality. But thinking deeper, this is more than just a matter of quality! "It doesn't matter" and "tear down and rebuild" are reflections of two different work attitudes. "It doesn't matter" means being careless about work; "tear down and rebuild" means being extremely responsible for work. Chairman Mao said: "Our responsibility is to be responsible to the people. Every word, every action, every policy must conform to the interests of the people. If there are mistakes, we must correct them. This is called being responsible to the people." The thought of "it doesn't matter" is incompatible with Chairman Mao's teaching. Like Squad Leader Li, all words and deeds that do not conform to the interests of the people must be "torn down and rebuilt."

    Repeated study and practice have given me a new understanding of the issue of the end point and the starting point. Serving the people has no end point. A revolutionary fighter who has won honor is only a starting point for continued progress. One must advance step by step in the revolutionary direction guided by Chairman Mao, never being satisfied and never stopping.

    Over the past few years, I have deeply realized that the process of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the process of repeatedly transforming one's thinking by using a standard (serving the people wholeheartedly) and a weapon (one dividing into two). No destruction, no construction. Only by destroying the bourgeois worldview can we establish the proletarian worldview; only by destroying metaphysics can we establish revolutionary dialectics. Learning has no end, and transformation has no end.

    读毛主席的书　做红色接班人
    北京部队某部排长　肖平
    肖平同志是革命干部的后代，是在红旗下长大的。但是，他从小较少接触工农群众，缺乏劳动和艰苦生活的锻炼，仍然具有一般知识分子的弱点。高中毕业以后，他参加了部队。他在部队中活学活用毛主席著作，解决了思想上存在的问题，成长为一个红色的革命战士。肖平同志的成长过程说明：即使是革命干部的子弟，出身好，仍然需要在三大革命运动中，以毛泽东思想为武器，不断地改造思想，牢固地树立起无产阶级的世界观，才能成为红色的接班人。
    个人理想和祖国需要
    入伍前，我是北京市第四十七中学的学生，一九六二年六月高中毕业。在校时，曾获得北京市中学生优良奖章，被评为三好学生，毕业成绩门门五分。老师和同学都建议我继续升学；我从小也有搞尖端科学的理想。正在这时，传来了蒋匪帮企图窜犯大陆的消息。升大学是多年的理想，上前线是祖国的急需，该怎么办呢？后来，我想到自己是战火中生，红旗下长大的红军后代，在祖国安全受到威胁时应当挺身而出。不然，国家不安宁，还谈得上什么个人理想呢？于是，我便怀着杀敌立功的心愿入伍了。
    谁知事与愿违，领导上不是让我上前线，而是叫我搞农副业生产。满腔热情一下子凉了半截。前线去不成，连大学也搭进去了。我要能搞尖端科学该多好啊！总觉得一个优秀生当“生产兵”是有些“屈才”。于是，有空就复习数、理、化和外语，好为将来考学打点基础。指导员看透了我的心思，他叫我多读读毛主席的书，以提高思想觉悟为主。当我重读了《为人民服务》、《论联合政府》等文章后，思想就震动了一下。我想，毛主席是说一切都要服从人民利益的需要。人民需要我去打仗，我就拿起枪杆上前线，人民需要我去生产，我就扛起锄头去生产。全心全意为人民服务，就是自己最大的理想。可是，以前我为啥不这样想呢？一想一比，我才发现自己没放下“出身好、文化高”的包袱。人入伍了，思想还没入伍。这时，父亲也来信嘱咐我：“一个革命战士在任何情况下，都要把党和人民的利益放在第一位，自觉地服从革命的需要，牢记毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导，随时准备为人民的利益牺牲一切。”这封信，使我想起了爸爸妈妈告诉我的一段往事：那是一九四三年春，我刚生下四十天，在去延安的途中，被敌人包围了，情况万分危急，带我很不方便。妈妈担心为我误了革命大事，想把我甩给老乡。叔叔们知道了都着急地说：“不能扔掉，这是革命的后代呀！”他们轮流背我突围，有的叔叔牺牲了生命，才使我们脱了险。想起这件事，我心里就难过。难道叔叔们期望的是我这样一个有私心的后代吗？难道当革命需要的时候还有什么个人利益不能牺牲吗？个人的理想只能是党的需要、人民利益和革命长辈的期望。想通后，我马上向团支部书记、副指导员作了汇报，决心努力学习毛主席著作，当好普通一兵。不久，连里评我为服役态度端正的标兵。这使我深深地感到：理想必须向着共产主义的阳光开花，在祖国需要的土壤上生长，只有这样，才能结出丰硕的果实。
    假结合和真结合
    毛主席关于知识分子一定要和工农群众结合的教导，我早在学校时就学过，但真正落实到自己的行动上，却经过了一个由表及里、从假到真的思想斗争过程。刚到部队，自己认为和工农同志一起生活、一起劳动、一起训练，这不就是结合了吗？可问题就出在这里，自己总感到思想深处和工农同志合不来。一天，战术小组演习，天冷得很，可小组长冯黑蛋非让我把线手套摘掉不可。我认为他真不关心人！等演习完后，他把自己那副新棉手套让给我戴，我心想：反正你不怕冷，让我戴就戴呗！事后我却发现冯黑蛋的双手冻得连饭碗都端不住了。这情景打动了我的心，使我明白了：他叫我摘手套，是从实战出发，叫我苦练杀敌本领，这不正是对我真正的爱吗？演习后，他宁愿自己挨冻，却把棉手套让给我，这不正是真正的阶级感情吗？事实教育了我，要和工农同志思想感情上真正打成一片，这中间有一个立场问题。如果不把头脑里的资产阶级世界观去掉，换一个无产阶级的世界观，永远不会同工农战士有相同的立场和感情，甚至把工农同志的长处也看成短处。我认真地分析了一下自己，发觉自己仍然背着优越感的包袱，没有放下臭架子。只看到从小在党的哺育下，经常受到革命思想熏陶，积极革命的一面，看不到从小较少接触工农，缺乏劳动和艰苦生活的锻炼，容易受资产阶级思想影响的一面。从毛主席关于“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合”的教导中，使我认识到：同工农同志结合得怎样是衡量自己思想改造得好坏的一个重要标志。于是我就暗下决心：要使自己革命化，必须老老实实工农化。
    虽然有了向工农学习的愿望，但要真正结合，还要经过一段艰苦的路程，甚至是痛苦的磨练，不流大汗、耐大劳是达不到真正结合的。一天，运高粱穗，每捆连泥带水二、三十斤，路程有二、三里地。我狠了狠心扛了三捆。道路泥泞，一步一陷，没走多远就吃不住劲了。肩又痛，腰又酸，好象连气也喘不过来。真想扔掉一捆，反正扛两捆也合乎要求。但又不敢扔掉国家的粮食。思想斗争越来越激烈。这时我一抬头看见了班长扛着四捆走得挺带劲。班长的形象使我想起了毛主席的教导：“没有什么困难可以阻碍人的前进的，只要奋斗，加以坚持，困难就赶跑了。”对呀，任何胜利不都是斗倒困难才能取得吗？越是在节骨眼上，越要向工农学习，克服“学生气”。我咬咬牙，坚持下来了。以后有时还扛四捆，终于赶上了老同志。虽然劳动艰苦，却第一次尝到了劳动的快乐和斗争的幸福。
    冬训开始了，气温降到零下二十多度，这正是锻炼杀敌本领的好机会。战术演习那天，天气更冷，我们迎着寒风，跃过矮墙，通过铁丝网，炸毁一个个碉堡，又经过阵地上的反复争夺，冲到悬崖底下已经精疲力尽。抓住攀登绳索，有点犹豫，想绕过去算了。但想到这是“打仗”，便往上攀。手冻麻木了，一没抓住，便滑了下来，回头看看深沟，思想斗争更激烈了。是上去呢，还是下来？一抬头看见了“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的标语，又看到农民出身的王根山已经到达顶峰，我要向他学习！就重新攀登，终于登上了六丈多高的悬崖，完成了演习任务，受到首长和同志们的好评。虽然后来十个手指头冻脱了皮，却增强了一层阶级感情。从这里我得到了一个启示：实行和工农同志结合，改造非无产阶级思想，也象攀登悬崖一样，尽管路途艰险，但只要有真心，敢于劳筋骨、炼思想，总会攀上顶峰的。
    终点和起点
    去年初，我被所在部队评为学习毛主席著作的积极分子，立了二等功，先后四次进京，见到刘主席、周总理和其他中央首长。党和人民给了自己很大的荣誉和鼓励，这是好事；但也使我遇到一个新的问题：是把荣誉当作起点，继续前进呢？还是把荣誉当作终点，停止不前。
    每次向同志们汇报自己的学习体会时，都听到热烈的掌声。开始认为是同志们为我的进步而鼓掌，心里有些甜滋滋的。后来，我学习了毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，感到自己在荣誉面前有些沾沾自喜了。这时，爸爸也及时来信提醒我。他说：“学好毛主席著作，必须有谦逊和老实的态度，时刻力戒满足和骄傲。”他的话引起了我的警惕：千万不能骄傲，自己的每一个进步都是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。同志们鼓掌是因为通过我的成长，看到了毛泽东思想的巨大威力，那是为伟大的毛泽东思想鼓掌。从认为为“我”鼓掌，到认为为毛泽东思想鼓掌，是一个思想斗争的过程，是弄清了成绩来源的结果。
    表扬和批评是检验一个人把荣誉当作起点还是当作终点的两块试金石。在表扬和批评面前，要以符合人民利益为标准，掌握一分为二的武器，善于从表扬中发现自己的不足，从批评中检查产生缺点的原因。有一次，我去兄弟部队介绍学习体会。会后，一位首长拍着我的肩膀说：“你可以作一个很好的革命接班人哪！”我觉得：这是对我提出了一个很高的要求。回连后，我就学习了毛主席提出的革命接班人的五个条件，并对照检查了自己，发现自己还差得很远。从这以后，我就注意用这五个条件来严格要求自己，把它当作改造自己的方向。另一次，四好初评时，全连同志一致评我为五好战士。火箭筒班的战士张河在军人大会上给我提了条意见，他说：“评肖平五好我同意，但他平时有点不爱理人，希望改正。”听到这个意见我很高兴，说明群众对我的要求是很高的，他们希望我能更广泛地团结同志，与群众打成一片。我的确没有做到这一点，应当努力改进。这两件事，使我深刻地体会到：对表扬要采取分析的态度，善于从中发现自己不很明显不很突出的问题，并认真加以解决，防止把表扬变作退步的开始。对批评要采取欢迎的态度，虚心地听取各种批评，学会举一反三，把批评变作进步的开始。只有这样，才能经常看到自己的缺点，既不会被表扬所夸倒，也不会被批评所压倒。
      一个人处于先进地位时，要不要向一般同志学习呢？我们的回答是肯定的。我们班里每个同志都有自己的优点。秦登田的小孩死了，工作丝毫没有受影响，能正确对待，我就学习他以革命利益为重的品德；赵成勇虽然没评上五好战士，并不气馁，还决心和我结成一对红，我就学习他对待荣誉的革命精神。不管那个同志的优点，我都把它写在本上，记在心里。在我们的队伍里，没有不可学的人，只有不虚心的人。没有短处的人是没有的，没有长处的人也是没有的。你骄傲了，把伟大也会看作平凡，你虚心了，从平凡中也能看到伟大。作为一个革命者，要当个有心人，善于从一般同志的日常言行中，学习不平凡的真理。不管是谁，只要你有真理我就向你学习。有两件事对我教育最深。一件是，班内一个同志弄坏了一个耙子，我便向工具保管员郗步停同志检讨了自己责任心不强。郗步停同志却说：“弄坏了东西光知道来检讨可不行呵！”我看他很不高兴，觉得没办法，就说：“要不我赔你一把好了！”谁知这一说，更惹得他生起气来，他说：“你就会说赔，赔，你没想想你是赔谁的？”当时我心里很不好受。但事后一想：为什么他听到这个“赔”字竟这样难以忍受？为什么我却轻易地说出了口？想来想去，我发现这个“赔”字象一面镜子，它照出了我同郗步停之间思想上的差距。损坏一个耙子也许是件小事，一个“赔”字也并不难说，但这中间却暴露了自己不是把“我”完全溶化于集体之中，用主人翁的态度对待集体事业和公共财产。以后我便组织全班学习了毛主席关于勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的教导，提高了认识，人人爱护维修工具，杜绝了损坏工具的现象。
    另一件事是：在砌墙时，一块土坯稍微突出了点。我心想，只要上面一块能标齐也不碍事。可是，七班长李存秀非叫拆掉重砌不可，他很注意质量。但是，往深处一想：这何止是质量问题呢！“不碍事”和“拆掉重砌”不正是两种工作态度的反映吗？“不碍事”就是对工作马马虎虎；“拆掉重砌”就是对工作极端地负责。毛主席说过：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。”“不碍事”的思想是和毛主席的这一教导格格不入的。要象七班长那样，凡是不适合人民利益的言行，都要“拆掉重砌”。
    反复的学习和实践，使我对终点和起点的问题有了新的理解。为人民服务是没有终点的，一个革命战士获得了荣誉，只是继续进步的起点，必须朝着毛主席指引的革命化方向，一步一个脚印地前进，永不满足，永不停止。
    几年来，我深深地体会到，活学活用毛主席著作的过程，就是运用一个标准（全心全意为人民服务）和一个武器（一分为二）反复改造自己思想的过程。不破不立，只有破资产阶级世界观，才能立无产阶级世界观；只有破了形而上学，才能立革命辩证法。学习无止境，改造无止境。
