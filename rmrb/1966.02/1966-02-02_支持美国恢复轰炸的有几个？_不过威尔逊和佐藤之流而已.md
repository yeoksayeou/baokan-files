    How Many Support the US Resumption of Bombing?
    Only the likes of Wilson and Sato!
    (Report from this newspaper) The accomplices of US imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam have always been just a small handful of people. In the past, they were enthusiastic brokers peddling Johnson's peace talk swindle, and now they are supporters and apologists for Johnson's resumption of bombing.
    The likes of Britain's Wilson and Japan's Sato are examples. After Johnson announced the resumption of bombing, the British government immediately issued a statement saying, "The British government understands and supports the US government's decision to resume bombing." The Japanese government's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hashimoto, in his published remarks, sang the same tune as Johnson, saying that the US resumption of bombing was "unavoidable."
    Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, in his reply at the Diet on January 31, blatantly stated that the Japanese government supports the US aggression against Vietnam and, reversing black and white, insisted that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was "invading" South Vietnam. He expressed "regret" over the bankruptcy of the US government's "peace talks" conspiracy.

    支持美国恢复轰炸的有几个？
    不过威尔逊和佐藤之流而已
    本报讯　美帝国主义侵越战争的帮凶，一直就只有一小撮人。他们过去是兜售约翰逊和谈骗局的热心掮客，现在是约翰逊恢复轰炸的支持者和辩护士。
    英国的威尔逊和日本的佐藤之流，就是例子。在约翰逊宣布恢复轰炸后，英国政府立即发表声明说：“英国政府了解并支持美国政府恢复轰炸的决定”。日本政府官房长官桥本在发表的谈话中，也同约翰逊唱一个调子，说什么美国恢复轰炸是出于“不得已”。
    日本首相佐藤荣作一月三十一日在国会答辩时，露骨地表示日本政府支持美国侵略越南，并颠倒黑白地硬说越南民主共和国“侵略”越南南方，他对美国政府“和谈”阴谋的破产表示“很遗憾”。
