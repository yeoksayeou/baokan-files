    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd. Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, in response to inquiries from Communist and Socialist Party members in the plenary sessions of the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives on the 2nd, vigorously defended the United States' resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the expansion of its war of aggression, and once again viciously attacked the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China.
    Sato shamelessly repeated the imperialist United States' cliché of North Vietnam's "aggression" against South Vietnam to absolve the United States of its guilt in resuming the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. He nonsensically claimed that it should not only condemn the United States for resuming the bombing of North Vietnam, "If the United States is to stop bombing, the aggression from the North must stop."
    He also explained that he was not expressing regret over the United States' resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but rather "regret over this situation caused by the continued infiltration of North Vietnam."
    Sato also expressed support for the United States using its tool, the United Nations, to interfere in the Vietnam issue. He touted the United Nations, which serves the United States' aggressive policies, as the "only international peace organization," insisting that intervention by the United Nations, which has nothing to do with it, in the Vietnam issue is "a matter of course."
    Sato stubbornly adhered to his reactionary stance of following the United States and being hostile to China. In his reply, he openly expressed support for the United States' policy of "containing" China, and slandered China's policy of resolutely opposing American imperialism and supporting national liberation movements as a "policy of military expansion," nonsensically claiming that "the United States' policy of containing China is a means of countering the CCP's policy of military expansion."

    佐藤公然恶毒攻击中越
    重复美国谰言为美国恢复轰炸帮腔
    新华社东京三日电　日本首相佐藤荣作二日在参议院和众议院全体会议上回答共产党、社会党议员的质询时，极力为美国恢复轰炸越南民主共和国、扩大侵略战争辩解，并且再次恶毒地攻击越南民主共和国和中华人民共和国。
    佐藤无耻地重复了美帝国主义的越南北方“侵略”越南南方的滥调，来为美国开脱恢复轰炸越南民主共和国、扩大侵越战争的罪责。他胡说什么不应当只谴责美国恢复轰炸越南北方，“如果要美国停止轰炸，必须停止来自北方的侵略”。
    他还解释他不是对美国恢复轰炸越南民主共和国表示遗憾，而是对“由于北越的继续渗透而造成这种事态表示遗憾”。
    佐藤还表示支持美国利用它的工具联合国干涉越南问题。他吹捧为美国侵略政策服务的联合国是“唯一的国际和平机构”，硬说由联合国干涉同它毫不相干的越南问题是“理所当然”的。
    佐藤顽固地坚持追随美国、敌视中国的反动立场，在答辩中公然表示支持美国“遏制”中国的政策，诬蔑中国坚决反对美帝国主义、支持民族解放运动的政策是“军事扩张的政策”，胡说“美国遏制中国政策是对抗中共军事扩张政策的手段”。
