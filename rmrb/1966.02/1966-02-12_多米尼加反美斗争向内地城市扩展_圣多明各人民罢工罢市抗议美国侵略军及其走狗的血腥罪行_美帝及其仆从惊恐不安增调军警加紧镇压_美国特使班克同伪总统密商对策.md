    Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: Santo Domingo news: The heroic and unyielding people of the Dominican capital once again held demonstrations on the 10th, angrily denouncing the bloody suppression atrocities committed by the American aggressor troops and puppet military police against patriotic students on the 9th.
    The American-controlled "Pan-American Forces" and Dominican reactionary military police opened fire on the demonstrating masses, killing one youth. The angry demonstrators, regardless of the brutal suppression, bravely fought back with sticks and stones, killing one policeman.
    It is reported that the anti-American struggle in the Dominican capital on the 10th has spread to inland cities - San Juan de la Maguana, La Romana and San Pedro de Macoris. Residents of these three cities held anti-American demonstrations on the 10th, expressing support for the heroic struggle of patriotic students in Santo Domingo and strongly condemning the American aggression against the Dominican Republic. The nationwide strike initiated by Dominican trade unions began on the evening of the 9th, protesting the barbaric crimes of the American aggressors and their running dogs. On the 10th, shops in Santo Domingo were closed, municipal offices stopped working, and transportation in the city was paralyzed. Students of the National University of Santo Domingo announced on the 10th that they would mourn the heroic martyrs for three days. Faced with the powerful anti-American demonstrations of the Dominican people, the "Pan-American Forces" and the puppet military police were extremely panicked. They are reinforcing troops in Santo Domingo in an attempt to further strengthen the bloody suppression. The US 82nd Airborne Division occupied the central area of ​​the city. On the 10th, gunshots and explosions were heard throughout the day in Santo Domingo.
    It is reported that in order to deal with the powerful demonstration struggle of the Dominican people, American Ambassador to the Organization of American States, Banks, held three meetings with the President of the Dominican "Provisional Government," Godoy, on the 10th. Banks also summoned Camineiro, the head of the right-wing army and "Minister of the Armed Forces" of the "Provisional Government," to his office for "talks."
