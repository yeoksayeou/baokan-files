    Helping Instead of Hindering
    To assist the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" deception, the Japanese Sato government recently appointed a "peace talks" special envoy and clamored about "preparing to spend two or three months visiting" Europe and Asia, "striving to promote a surge in the atmosphere of peace."
    Johnson's "peace talks" deception has long been bankrupt, yet the Sato government is so eagerly running errands for it, which can only be described as utterly loyal. However, Johnson sent six special envoys to visit thirty-four countries and made contact with one hundred and fifteen governments, but still could not prevent the bankruptcy of his "peace talks" deception. What special skills does Sato's "special envoy" have that can "promote a surge in the atmosphere of peace"? The Japanese reactionaries, who are eagerly hoping to get rich by the U.S. expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, are zealously working for Johnson's "peace offensive," which can only make the essence of this deception even more obvious. Isn't Sato's "efforts" actually helping Johnson by hindering him?

    帮倒忙
    日本佐藤政府为了替美帝国主义“和谈”骗局效劳，最近任命了一名“和谈”特使，并叫嚷“准备用两三个月的时间遍访”欧亚两洲，“努力促进和平的气氛高涨起来。”
    约翰逊的“和谈”骗局早已破产，佐藤政府还这样热切为之奔走，不能不说是忠心耿耿。可是，约翰逊派了六名特使去访问三十四个国家，同一百十五个政府进行了接触，也无法避免其“和谈”骗局的破产，佐藤的“特使”又有什么特殊的本领，可以“促进和平的气氛高涨起来”呢？一心盼着靠美国扩大侵越战争发横财的日本反动派热心为约翰逊的“和平攻势”卖力，只能使人更加看出这种骗局的底细。佐藤的“努力”，不是给约翰逊帮倒忙吗？
