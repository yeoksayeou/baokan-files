    The process of integrating theory with practice is also a process of ideological remolding. When one is not consciously remolding one's ideology, the understanding of practice is one way; when one is consciously remolding one's ideology, the understanding of practice is another way. To establish the work style of integrating theory with practice, one must wage unremitting struggle against the petty personal world in one's mind.

    Through participating in two years of production practice, I have gradually freed myself from the dead end of scientific research and begun to realize what the proletarian worldview is, and what the "practice" in integrating theory with practice actually refers to. In the early days after the founding of the People's Republic, the Party called on us to integrate theory with practice. Many scientific departments, according to the requirements of their own theoretical research, conducted a large number of investigations and studies, hoping to find practical and material evidence for the theories they required. This is probably what everyone considered to be integrating theory with practice. Soil workers, in order to explore the theory of the staged changes in soil fertility, also conducted field investigations and studied the history of soil genesis and evolution and the relationship between soil fertility characteristics. This is also the integration of soil science theory with practice. Based on such work, we drew a large number of charts, wrote a large number of reports, and even formulated land use plans. However, the results of soil research were rarely directly used in production, and were often treated as information for reference only. What is the reason for this? The reason still lies in being detached from reality.

    Two years of production practice have brought me closer to the peasant masses, and I have seen some specific situations of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments in rural areas. I have become more clearly aware that in the past, there were only objects but no practice in scientific research. The practice that soil science researchers should understand mainly lies in the needs of the masses in their lives and production struggles. To know what is practical, one must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, oppose book worship, go deep among the masses, especially deep among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, conduct investigations and visits, share weal and woe with them, and understand their needs. If we really do this, we will no longer regard the research of a few plants, a few insects, and a few soil profiles as the most important thing in the world. People will appear in our minds, and there will be both people and things, instead of seeing things but not people.

    When soil science or any discipline serves production, theory is needed. Many disciplines also need to strengthen theoretical research to make it a strong arrow to shoot at the target of production practice. Such arrows can only be sharpened on the whetstone of production struggle, and pure textbook teaching cannot create such arrows. The reason is very simple: one cannot learn to swim in a washbasin.

    To get rid of the petty personal world in one's mind and establish the proletarian worldview is by no means just a matter of general social interactions, but it is necessary to earnestly and correctly implement the Party's policies and Chairman Mao's teachings in specific work to achieve something. When we first gave way to following the team to labor in the production practice instead of soil modification charts, although I knew that it was the right thing to do, I still had concerns in secret, worrying about not grasping theory and not improving the quality of teaching. But when we discovered that high yields were dug out from under the hoe, and also production theories of soil science, and when the hoe closely linked us with the working people, we realized the greatness of the Party's policies, and we also saw that the hoe is a more valuable scientific instrument than the soil drill.

    This gain has raised our political consciousness, made us feel that we stand higher and see farther, our ideological field has been broadened, and the boundaries of love and hatred are relatively clear. Therefore, we are also willing to abandon the tedious philosophy in teaching and scientific research, and are determined to serve the peasants wholeheartedly. Last year, in the Southeast Gully Brigade of Huairou County in the suburbs of Beijing, we dared to work with the masses to carry out the "Three Fields Movement" on a large scale, and achieved better results in ideology and production. This is a victory for further breaking the old framework and changing the working methods.

    我开始懂得了什么是实际
    北京农业大学教授　李连捷
    理论联系实际的过程，同时是思想改造的过程。当对思想改造不自觉的时候，对实际的理解是一种样子；当对思想改造处于自觉的时候，对实际的理解则又是另一种样子。要树立理论联系实际的作风，就要同头脑里的个人小天地进行不懈的斗争。
    通过参加两年的生产实习，逐步使我摆脱科学研究的死胡同，开始认识到什么是无产阶级的世界观，理论联系实际中的“实际”，究系何物。建国之初，就听到党号召我们要理论联系实际。许多科学部门，根据自己研究理论的要求，进行着大量的调查研究，以期使所要求的理论，得到实际实物的佐证。这恐怕就是大家认为的理论联系实际。土壤工作者为了探求土壤肥力阶段性变化的理论，也进行了实地调查，研究了土壤发生演变的历史和土壤肥力性状关系。这也就是土壤学的理论联系实际。我们在这样的工作基础上，绘制了大量的图表，编写了大量的报告，甚至制定了土地利用规划。但是，土壤研究成果却很少直接利用在生产上，经常的是被当作仅供参考的资料。这是什么原因呢？原因还在于脱离实际。
    两年的生产实习，使我接近了农民群众，看到了农村中阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的一些具体情况，我就更清楚地认识到，过去科学研究中，只有实物，而无实际。土壤科学研究工作者所应该了解的实际，主要是群众在生活和生产斗争中的需要。要知道什么是实际，就得遵循毛主席的教导，反对本本主义，深入到群众中去，特别是深入到广大的贫下中农中去，进行调查访问，和他们同甘共苦，了解他们的需要。真的这样做了，我们就不会再把几棵草木、几条虫子和几个土壤剖面的研究，当做天下大事。在我们的思想里，就会出现了人，就会有人有物，而不是见物不见人了。
    土壤学或任何学科为生产服务时，都需要理论。许多学科还要加强理论的研究，使它成为过硬之矢，以射生产实际之的。这样的矢也只能是在生产斗争的磨刀石上磨出来的，单纯的书本教学创造不了这样的矢。道理很简单：脸盆里学不会游泳。
    摆脱脑子里的个人小天地，树立无产阶级的世界观，绝不是一般的送往迎来，而是要在具体的工作中，认真而正确地执行党的政策和毛主席的教导，才能有所收获。当我们第一次在生产实习中，把土壤调制图等让位给跟班劳动这一课的时候，尽管我确实知道做得对头，但暗中仍有顾虑，担心抓不到理论，提高不了教学质量。可是当我们发现锄头底下刨出了高产，也刨出了土壤学的生产理论，锄头把我们与劳动人民紧密地联在一起的时候，我们就认识到党的政策的伟大，也看到了锄头比土钻是更有价值的科学仪器了。
    这一收获提高了我们的政治觉悟，使我们感到站得高了，也看得远了，思想领域有所开阔，爱憎的界限也比较分明。因之，也就甘心情愿地舍弃教学与科学研究中的烦琐哲学，立志要全心全意为农民服务。我们去年在北京郊区怀柔县东南沟大队，敢于同群众一起大搞三田运动，并在思想和生产上取得较好的收获，就是进一步打破旧框框，变革工作方法的胜利。
