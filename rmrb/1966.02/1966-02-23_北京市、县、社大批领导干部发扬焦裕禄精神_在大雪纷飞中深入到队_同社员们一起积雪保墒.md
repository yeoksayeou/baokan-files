　　A Large Number of Leading Cadres in Beijing Municipality, Counties, and Communes Promote the Spirit of Jiao Yulu
　　Go Deep into the Teams Amidst Heavy Snowfall
    Accumulate Snow and Preserve Moisture Together with Commune Members
    Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd -- A large number of leading cadres from relevant departments in Beijing Municipality and from counties and communes, taking Comrade Jiao Yulu as their model, went deep into production teams amidst heavy snowfall and freezing cold. They swept snow, transported snow, and carried out activities to accumulate snow and preserve moisture together with the broad masses of commune members, further preparing for spring plowing.
    In the past two days, the Beijing area has experienced heavy snowfall. After studying the brilliant revolutionary deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, the county and commune leading cadres of Fangshan County, before the snow had even stopped, County Party Secretary Huo Liang, Deputy Secretary Zhang Lingde, and many other leading cadres went to the production teams to sweep and transport snow to dry land with the broad masses of commune members. Huo Liang went to the more difficult mountain commune teams, helping to sweep and transport snow, while also understanding the problems faced by the production teams and poor and lower-middle peasants after the heavy snowfall. In the plains area of this county, more than forty thousand commune members and more than one thousand large carts and five thousand handcarts were mobilized in the past two days to transport snow from the sides of roads, ditches, courtyards, and other places to thousands of mu of cultivated land. Gao Huaxing, Deputy Secretary of the Miyun County Party Committee, rushed to Kanggezhuang Brigade of Xiejia Mountain Commune amidst the heavy snow and accumulated snow with the commune members, which greatly encouraged the commune members. On that day, more than three hundred commune members braved the snow to sweep and transport snow.
    In many places such as Shunyi, Fangshan, and Daxing, county and commune cadres went down to the production teams. In addition to helping the production teams to accumulate and transport snow, they also organized forces to continue to dig wells and repair canals, combining the current work of accumulating snow and preserving moisture with long-term water conservancy construction.
    In the midst of the intense activities of accumulating snow and preserving moisture, many leading cadres from Beijing Municipality and counties went deep into the front line to conduct serious investigations and research, and promptly summarized many effective experiences of the masses in accumulating snow and preserving moisture. For example, compressing snow to preserve moisture, transporting snow to dry land and pit fields, harrowing the white land after the snow melts, and loosening wheat fields, and so on. At present, the broad masses of commune members and many leading cadres believe that this heavy snow is beneficial for the greening of wheat and the sowing of early-maturing crops. However, the spring wind is strong, and the land is prone to losing moisture, so we must not become complacent because of this snowfall. We should continue to seize the opportunity to build water conservancy projects that should and can be built with our greatest efforts; wheat fields and early spring crop land that were not winter-irrigated last year should also pay attention to timely spring irrigation.

　　北京市、县、社大批领导干部发扬焦裕禄精神
　　在大雪纷飞中深入到队
    同社员们一起积雪保墒
    新华社二十二日讯　北京市有关部门和县、社的大批领导干部以焦裕禄同志为榜样，在大雪纷飞中，踏雪冒寒深入生产队，和广大社员一起扫雪、运雪，开展积雪保墒活动，进一步为春耕做好准备。
    最近两天，北京地区下了大雪。房山县的县、社领导干部学习了焦裕禄同志的光辉革命事迹后，在大雪还未停止时，县委书记霍梁、副书记张令德以及很多领导干部，就分头到生产队，和广大社员一起扫雪，往旱地里运雪。霍梁到困难较多的山区社队，一边帮助扫雪、运雪，一边了解生产队和贫农下中农在大雪后存在的问题。这个县的平原地区的十几个公社，两天来出动四万多个社员和一千多辆大车、五千多辆手推车，把道旁、沟里、院里等处的积雪，运到了上千亩耕地里去。密云县委副书记高华兴，在大雪中赶到卸甲山公社康各庄大队，和社员一道积雪，对社员鼓舞很大，当天就有三百多社员冒雪扫雪，积雪运雪。
    顺义、房山、大兴等许多地方的县、社干部下到生产队，除帮助生产队做好积雪、运雪外，还组织力量继续打井、修渠，把当前的积雪保墒工作和长远的水利建设结合起来。
    在紧张的积雪保墒活动中，北京的市、县许多领导干部深入第一线认真进行调查研究，及时总结了许多群众行之有效的积雪保墒经验。如，压雪保墒，给旱地、坑田运雪，雪化以后耙白地，搂麦田，等等。现在，广大社员和不少领导干部认为，这场大雪，对小麦返青和播种早熟作物有好处，但是，春风大，地容易跑墒，决不能因为下了这场雪就麻痹大意起来，应该修、也可以修的水利工程，还要尽最大努力继续抓紧兴修；去年没有冬灌的麦田和早春作物地，还要注意适时春灌。
