    The Sichuan, Liaoning, Yunnan Provincial Party Committees, and Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committees Call on Cadres at the County Level and Above to Study Chairman Mao's Writings with a High Sense of Revolutionary Responsibility, and More Consciously Use Mao Zedong Thought to Transform Their World Outlook and Guide the Three Great Revolutionary Movements

    Sichuan

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 8th, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee recently issued a notice requiring Party committees at all levels above the county level to earnestly grasp the study of Chairman Mao's writings by responsible cadres above the county level, discover and cultivate more and better advanced units and activists in studying Chairman Mao's writings, and launch a new upsurge in the study of Chairman Mao's writings.

    The notice requires Party committees at all levels above the county level to regard the living study and application of Chairman Mao's writings as the most fundamental task and put it in the first place of all work.

    The notice points out: Cadres above the county level must focus on solving prominent political issues, closely integrate with the work of their own region and unit, and earnestly study Chairman Mao's relevant works.  While arranging work, inspecting work, and summarizing work, it is necessary to arrange study, inspect study, and summarize study.

    The notice emphasizes that leading cadres should transform their thinking and improve their understanding through study, more consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the three great revolutionary movements, and better guide cadres and the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a living way.  Make Mao Zedong Thought take command in all work, promote the revolutionization of people, do a good job, promote production, create more advanced units like Dazhai and Daqing, and successfully complete the tasks of the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan.

    Liaoning

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 5th, in an instruction issued to Party organizations at all levels throughout the province on February 2nd on deepening the movement to study Chairman Mao's writings, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee emphasized that Party committees at all levels, especially the first secretaries, should personally grasp the study of Chairman Mao's writings and solve the problem of understanding the relationship between politics and work, and the command of politics over work by leading cadres at all levels.

    The Liaoning Provincial Party Committee pointed out: Whether leading cadres study Chairman Mao's writings or not, and whether they grasp the study or not, is a matter of Party spirit. Leading cadres at all levels, especially cadres above the county level, must take the lead in studying well, strive to gradually master Mao Zedong Thought, and use it to solve the various problems encountered in the three great revolutionary movements.

    The instruction also requires Party committees and leading organs at all levels above the commune level to go deep into the grassroots, help grassroots branches study and apply Chairman Mao's writings in a living way, and lead the workers and peasants to study Chairman Mao's writings, as their most fundamental task.

    The instruction points out that in areas or units carrying out the socialist education movement, it is necessary to grasp the guidance of the movement with Mao Zedong Thought, so that the socialist education movement becomes a movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, and to establish a regular ideological and political work system through the study of Chairman Mao's writings.

    The instruction emphasizes that study must work hard on the word "use", to transform the objective world, especially to transform the subjective world.

    Yunnan

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, February 6th, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee requires cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres above the county level, to strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's writings, further highlight politics in all work, and adhere to using Mao Zedong Thought to take command.

    The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee emphasized that it is necessary to firmly grasp the study of leading cadres at all levels, especially leading cadres above the county level and the Party committee team.  This is the key to further highlighting politics and using Mao Zedong Thought to command all work.  It is necessary to ensure that everyone grasps it, grasp the leaders, grasp it firmly, and grasp it to the end.  If leading cadres and the Party committee team cannot truly master Mao Zedong Thought, they will not be able to adapt to the requirements of the current new situation, nor will they be able to cultivate and train a revolutionary contingent armed with Mao Zedong Thought who are both red and expert.  Leading cadres taking the lead in studying and using well is not only essential for their own transformation of thinking and improvement of work, but also a most practical and effective leadership and supervision for the study of general cadres and the masses.

    The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee emphasized that it is necessary to further clarify the purpose of study, implement the principle of linking theory with practice and studying and applying in a living way, especially to work hard on the word "use" and firmly grasp ideological revolutionization. To this end, it is necessary to adhere to the past experience of learning, and implement "three for" and "three with", that is, to study for the revolution, to study for the transformation of world outlook, and to study for the improvement of work; to study with problems that determine the state of mind, to study with the main problems in the work, and to study with major problems of the situation and policy. Among them, it is particularly necessary to study for the transformation of thinking, with problems that determine the state of mind.

    Xinjiang

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, February 9th, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China recently instructed Party organizations at all levels to place the organization of cadres to study Mao Zedong Thought on the agenda of the Party committee as a top priority, earnestly strengthen the leadership of cadres, especially Party member cadres above the county level, in studying, and work hard on the word "use".

    The instruction emphasized that organizing cadres of all nationalities to earnestly study Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for improving the Marxist-Leninist level of cadres of all nationalities and doing a good job in various tasks in the autonomous region. Party member cadres above the county level, especially senior leading cadres, bear a heavy responsibility to the Party and the people. How their thinking is transformed and whether their work is done well is of great importance to the cause of the Party and the people. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's writings well with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility and consciousness, and earnestly master Mao Zedong Thought.

    The instruction emphasized: The only criterion for testing whether a leading cadre has studied well is to see whether he uses it well, and whether he uses it to transform and improve his thinking, and to improve and do his work well. This requires leading cadres at all levels to closely link with the problems existing in their own thinking and work, and to carry out study with a purpose and focus.

    The Autonomous Region Party Committee pointed out that leading cadres should adhere to self-study at ordinary times. The idea of not studying hard at ordinary times and just waiting for opportunities to study specifically often leads to repeated mistakes, causing one's learning to remain in a backward state for a long time.

    Tibet

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, February 9th, the Tibet Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed leading cadres above the county level to earnestly put the study of Chairman Mao's writings in the first place of all work, and to form a good atmosphere.

    The instruction requires Party committees at all levels to discover units and individuals who study Chairman Mao's writings well, and to pay special attention to discovering good examples of Tibetan cadres and other minority cadres above the county level in studying Chairman Mao's writings, and organize them to exchange learning experiences, so as to further promote the development of the movement to study Chairman Mao's writings. The instruction also requires Party committees at all levels to combine grasping the study of Chairman Mao's writings by leading cadres above the county level with grasping the study of Chairman Mao's writings by the vast number of cadres and activists, so as to form a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's writings and promote the development of Tibet's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    The Autonomous Region Party Committee and the Party Committee of the Tibet Military Region also jointly issued instructions, calling on cadres, workers, PLA commanders and fighters, and farmers and herdsmen throughout the autonomous region to learn from the Plateau Red Border Defense Team – the Tibet Chaguo La Border Defense Team, which has consistently studied and applied Chairman Mao's writings in a living way and highlighted politics.

    四川
    据新华社成都八日电　中共四川省委最近在一项通知中要求县以上各级党委认真抓好县以上负责干部对毛主席著作的学习，发现和培养更多更好学习毛主席著作的先进单位和积极分子，掀起学习毛主席著作的新高潮。
    通知要求县以上各级党委把活学活用毛主席著作作为最根本的任务，放在一切工作的首位。
    通知指出：县以上干部必须以解决突出政治问题为中心，紧密结合本地区、本单位的工作，认真学习毛主席有关著作。要在布置工作、检查工作、总结工作的同时，布置学习、检查学习、总结学习。
    通知强调，领导干部要通过学习，改造思想，提高认识，更自觉地用毛泽东思想来指导三大革命运动，更好地指导干部和群众活学活用毛主席著作。使毛泽东思想在一切工作中挂帅，促进人的革命化，搞好工作，推动生产，创造更多大寨、大庆式的先进单位，胜利完成第三个五年计划第一年的任务。
    辽宁                
    据新华社沈阳五日电　中共辽宁省委二日在发给全省各级党组织关于深入开展学习毛主席著作运动的指示中，强调各级党委首先是第一书记要亲自抓好对毛主席著作的学习，并且解决各级领导干部对政治和业务的关系、政治统帅业务的认识问题。
    辽宁省委指出：领导干部学不学毛主席著作，抓不抓学习，是一个党性问题。各级领导干部，特别是县以上干部必须带头学好，求得逐步掌握毛泽东思想，用以解决三大革命运动中遇到的各种问题。
    指示还要求公社以上的各级党委和领导机关，把深入基层，帮助基层支部活学活用毛主席著作并带动工农群众学习毛主席著作，作为自己一项最根本的任务。
    指示指出，开展社会主义教育运动的地区或单位，必须抓以毛主席思想指导运动的开展，使社会主义教育运动成为活学活用毛泽东思想的运动。并通过学习毛主席著作，建立起经常的思想政治工作制度。
    指示强调指出，学习必须在“用”字上狠下功夫，用来改造客观世界，特别是用来改造主观世界。
    云南
    据新华社昆明六日电　中共云南省委要求各级干部特别是县以上的领导干部加强学习毛主席著作，在一切工作中进一步突出政治，坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅。
    云南省委强调要狠抓各级领导干部，特别是县以上的领导干部和党委班子的学习。这是进一步突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切工作的关键。一定要做到头头抓，抓头头，抓住不放，一抓到底。如果领导干部和党委班子不能真正把毛泽东思想学到手，就无法适应当前新的形势的要求，也就不能培养锻炼出一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的、又红又专的革命队伍。领导干部带头学好、用好，不仅是自己改造思想、改进工作所必不可少的，对一般干部和群众的学习也是一种最实际最有效的领导和督促。
    云南省委着重指出，一定要进一步明确学习的目的性，贯彻理论联系实际、活学活用的原则，特别是在“用”字上下功夫，狠抓思想革命化。为此，必须坚持过去取得的学习经验，实行“三为”、“三带”，即为革命而学，为改造世界观而学，为改进工作而学；带着决定精神状态的问题学，带着工作中的主要问题学，带着重大形势问题和政策问题学。其中，特别是要带着决定精神状态的问题，为改造思想而学。
    新疆
    据新华社乌鲁木齐九日电　中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会最近指示各级党组织，把组织干部学习毛泽东思想放在党委议事日程的首位，切实加强对干部特别是县级以上党员干部学习的领导，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    指示中强调，组织各民族干部认真学习毛泽东思想，是提高各民族干部的马克思列宁主义水平，做好自治区各项工作的根本保证。县以上党员干部，特别是高级领导干部，对党、对人民负有重大的责任，他们的思想改造得如何，工作做得好坏，对党和人民的事业关系极大。因此，各级领导干部必须以高度的革命责任心和自觉精神，带头学好毛主席著作，切实把毛泽东思想学到手。
    指示着重指出：检验一个领导干部学得好不好，唯一的标准是看他用得好不好，看他是不是用来改造和提高了思想，改进和做好了工作。这就要求各级领导干部密切联系自己的思想和工作中存在的问题，有目的有重点地进行学习。
    自治区党委指出，领导干部要坚持平时的自学。那种平时不努力学习，只是等待机会来专门学习的想法，往往是一误再误，使自己的学习长期处于落后状态。
    西藏
    据新华社拉萨九日电　中共西藏自治区委员会指示县以上领导干部切实把学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，并且形成风气。
    指示中要求各级党委发现对毛主席著作学得好的单位和个人，特别要注意发现县以上藏族干部和其他少数民族干部学习毛主席著作的好典型，并组织他们交流学习经验，进一步推动学习毛主席著作运动的开展。指示还要求各级党委把抓县以上领导干部对毛主席著作的学习，同抓广大干部与积极分子对毛主席著作的学习结合起来，以形成一个群众性的学习毛主席著作的运动，促进西藏社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的发展。
    自治区党委和西藏军区党委还联合发出指示，号召全自治区的干部、职工、解放军指战员和农牧民，向一贯活学活用毛主席著作、突出政治的高原红色边防队——西藏查果拉边防队学习。
