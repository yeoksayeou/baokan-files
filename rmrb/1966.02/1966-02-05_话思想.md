    Talking about Ideology
    Regarding emphasizing politics, many comrades have written to us based on their experiences in practical work, expressing their views and raising questions. We will publish excerpts here for everyone to discuss and consider.

    Soft Tasks vs. Hard Tasks
    Some county and commune cadres believe that as long as production is increased, politics will naturally be emphasized. They say: Production is real, it’s a "hard task," and you will be criticized if you don't complete it well; political work is intangible, it’s a "soft task," and leaders rarely inquire about whether it is completed or not. Is this statement correct? If it is incorrect, where is the mistake?

    Grasping Grain vs. Grasping Politics
    When I took office as the Deputy Party Secretary of Renhe Commune, the county party committee instructed: "The most important thing is to grasp ideological and political work." But the county party committee does not routinely check this work. I consulted experienced comrades who had served as Commune Party Secretaries. They kindly said: "Our task in rural work is to engage in agricultural production! No matter how good other things are, it's no good if you can't produce grain." So, I put all my efforts into agricultural production. Is this the right thing to do?

    Grasping Measures vs. Grasping Ideology
    Liu Jinjie, Deputy Secretary of the Gu’an County Party Committee, was stationed in the Liuquan Brigade. He observed that many cadres in this brigade were talking about boosting morale. However, where should the morale be boosted? What measures should be taken to achieve a bumper harvest? None of these had been implemented. He did not criticize these cadres, nor did he replace them in giving commands. Instead, he convened a forum of cadres and representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants. From current major domestic and international events, he discussed the developing drought situation, analyzing the unfavorable and favorable factors for increasing production. Among the favorable factors, he particularly emphasized the greatest favorable condition: the increased awareness of cadres and the masses after the Socialist Education Movement. Then he asked everyone: "What do you say we rely on to increase production?" The Sixth Team Leader, Gao Wanfeng, said: "What do we rely on? Of course, we rely on people, not on heaven." Then, measures to increase production were proposed one by one. The next day, some teams collected human urine to fertilize the wheat.
    Using human urine to fertilize wheat had been advocated for many years, but it had never been realized. Now, they came up with the idea themselves and proposed it themselves, and it immediately turned into action. Comrade Liu Jinjie said when talking about this small matter that, farmers are focusing on production, and we are also focusing on production. Farmers are focusing on the solar terms, but if we do not focus on politics and ideology, and simply follow the solar terms, how can we play a leading role?

    The Factor of Heaven vs. The Factor of People
    Recently, the Political Work Conference convened by the Leping County Party Committee in Jiangxi raised a question: Increasing production is the factor of people first, and decreasing production is also the factor of people first.
    At first, some comrades in the areas with decreased production could not understand this statement and felt a bit "wronged." They said: "It's not that we don't want to increase production, but the conditions are not good." In short, decreased production is the factor of heaven first. The county party committee guided everyone to start by summarizing the production in 1965 and launch a discussion on "Does production rely on heaven? Or does it rely on people and ideology?" The areas with decreased production found the root causes of decreased production and the direction for production efforts this year, and no longer felt "wronged."

    话思想
    对于突出政治，许多同志根据实际工作中的体会，来信提出了自己的看法和疑问，我们将陆续摘要发表在这里，供大家讨论参考。
                                          　编者
    软任务与硬任务
    有的县、社干部认为，只要把生产抓上去，政治也就突出了。他们说：生产是实的，是“硬任务”，完成不好要吃批评；政治工作是无形的，是“软任务”，完成与否领导都很少过问。这种说法到底对不对呢？如果不对又错在那里呢？　　黑龙江密山　唐万生
    抓粮食与抓政治
    我到人和公社担任党委副书记时，县委交代：“重要的是抓住思想政治工作”。但是县委日常并不检查这项工作。我向担任过公社党委书记的老同志取经，他们好心地讲：“我们做农村工作的，任务就是搞农业生产嘛！这好那好，打不出粮食就是不好。”于是，我就把一身劲使到农业生产上去了。到底这样做对不对呢？
                          　　黑龙江巴彦县　　丛殿英
    抓措施与抓思想
    河北固安县委副书记刘金杰同志在柳泉大队蹲点，他看到这个大队有不少干部在谈论鼓干劲的问题。但是，劲往哪里鼓？夺取丰收的措施是什么？都没有落实下来。他没有批评这些干部，也没有代替他们去指挥，而是召集干部和贫下中农代表开座谈会。从当前国内外大事谈到大旱的发展形势，分析了增产的不利因素和有利因素，在有利因素中，特别提出社会主义教育运动后干部和群众觉悟提高的这个最大有利条件。然后问大家：“你们说增产靠什么？”六队长高万峰说：“靠什么，当然是靠人，不能靠天”。接着，增产措施一项一项地提出来了。第二天有些队就收集人尿浇了麦子。
    用人尿浇麦，这里号召了好多年，始终没有实现，现在他们自己想办法，自己提出来了，就马上变成了行动。刘金杰同志谈到这件小事时说，农民抓生产，我们也抓生产，农民抓生产是抓节气，我们要不抓政治，不抓思想，也是单纯跟上节气转，那怎能发挥领导作用呢？

    天的因素与人的因素
    最近，江西乐平县委召开的政治工作会议上提出了一个问题：增产是人的因素第一，减产也是人的因素第一。
    开始，减产地区有的同志对这种提法想不通，感到有点“委屈”。他们说：“不是我们不想增产，主要是条件不好。”一句话，减产是天的因素第一。县委引导大家从总结一九六五年的生产入手，开展“生产是靠天？还是靠人靠思想？”的讨论，减产地区从中找到了减产的根源，又找到了今年生产努力的方向，不再感到“委屈”了。
