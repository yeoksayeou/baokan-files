    From Demanding Convenience to Providing Convenience
    In the past, we believed that the bank was the state's general cashier, and all departments should act according to the bank's requirements. In our work, we emphasized that enterprises should provide convenience to the bank, such as tidying up banknotes and depositing and withdrawing them on time, etc. Whenever enterprises submitted messy payments, we would deal with them by "first criticizing, then delaying, then satirizing, and finally refusing to accept." Enterprises criticized us for keeping the convenience for ourselves and giving the difficulties to others.
    After studying Chairman Mao's works, I went to the sugar, tobacco, and liquor store to work alongside the staff. Seeing that the enterprises were busy and the salespeople were not skilled in counting money, I felt that we should not just complain about the enterprises but should help them solve practical problems. Later, I also sent two comrades from my section to work alongside them. When they returned, they also said, "We are busy, but they are even busier than us. The bank serves the enterprises, and we should think more for the enterprises."
    Through discussions, everyone put forward the slogan "Welcome difficulties, provide convenience, and serve the enterprises." The tellers used their less busy mornings to send people to enterprises to collect payments and teach techniques. The relationship between the two sides became closer. Since 1965, we have received letters of commendation from more than twenty units. With our help, enterprises have improved their techniques for counting banknotes. Now, payments are neat, accurate, and timely, which greatly facilitates the work of the bank. It's really true: demanding convenience yields nothing; providing convenience yields good results.

    从要方便到送方便
    以前，我们认为银行是国家的总出纳，各个部门都应该按照银行的要求办事。工作中，强调企业要为银行送方便，如票子要整理齐，要按时存取，等等。一遇到企业交款不整齐，就采取“一顶、二拖、三讽刺、四不收”的办法对待他们。企业批评我们是把方便留给自己，把困难送给别人。
    学习毛主席著作以后，我到糖烟酒门市部跟班劳动，看到企业里工作忙，营业员整点款子的技术不熟练，我觉得不能光埋怨企业，应该帮助他们解决实际问题。后来，我又让股里两位同志去跟班劳动。他们回来也说：“我们忙，人家比我们还忙。银行是为企业服务的，应该多为企业想想。”
    大家通过座谈讨论，提出“迎困难，送方便，为企业服务”的口号。出纳人员利用上午不太忙的时间，抽人到企业去登门收款，传授技术。双方的关系密切了。一九六五年以来，我们收到了二十多个单位的表扬信。企业在我们帮助下，提高了整点票子的技术，现在交款又齐、又准、又及时，大大方便了银行的工作。这真是：要方便得不到；送方便，效果好。
