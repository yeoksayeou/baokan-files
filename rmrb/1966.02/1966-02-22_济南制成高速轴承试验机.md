　　Jinan Produces High-Speed Bearing Testing Machine
    An instrument for testing the performance of high-speed bearings, designed for scientific research departments and precision bearing factories, has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Jinan Materials Testing Machine Factory.
    High-speed bearings are mainly used in dental medical equipment, high-speed printing presses, high-speed cameras, high-speed grinding machine spindles, high-speed gyroscopes, and jet engine spindles. The newly manufactured instrument can test the structure and material properties of bearings running at 120,000 revolutions per minute, verify the limit speed of the bearings, and measure the temperature of the outer circular surface friction heat generated by the bearings due to high-speed operation at any time.
    This high-speed bearing testing machine itself is equipped with a special cooling device, which can operate normally under high temperature and high-speed conditions.

　　济南制成高速轴承试验机
    供科学研究部门和精密轴承厂用来试验高速轴承性能的仪器，最近在济南材料机厂试制成功。
    高速轴承主要应用在牙科医疗器械、高速印刷机、高速摄影机、磨床高速主轴、高速陀螺仪和喷气发动机的主轴上。新制成的仪器可以试验每分钟十二万转的轴承的结构、材料性能，校验轴承的极限转数，并且能够随时测量轴承由于高速运转而产生的外圆表面磨擦热的温度。
    这种高速轴承试验机本身设有特殊冷却装置，可以在高温、高速的情况下正常运转。
