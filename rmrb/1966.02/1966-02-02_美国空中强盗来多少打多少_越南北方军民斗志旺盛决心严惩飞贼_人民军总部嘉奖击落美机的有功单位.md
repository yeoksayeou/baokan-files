    American Air Bandits Will Be Struck Down No Matter How Many Come
    North Vietnamese Military and Civilians Are Highly Motivated and Determined to Severely Punish the Flying Thieves
    People's Army Headquarters Commends Meritorious Units for Shooting Down American Aircraft
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 1st - Our correspondent reports: On January 31st, the military and civilians of North Vietnam bravely met the "resumed bombing" of American air bandits, shooting down five American aircraft in one fell swoop. This shows that they had long seen through the "peace talks" swindle of American imperialism, and possessed an iron will to stand ready and to fight to the end.
    The air defense forces of the Vietnamese People's Army have launched a fervent competition to shoot down enemy aircraft, determined to bring down enemy aircraft on the spot with the first volley. The commanders and fighters of a certain air defense unit, which shot down seven enemy aircraft in the battle to defend the Wang Bi industrial area near Haiphong, have now made a heroic vow: "We are determined to fight to defend the motherland, even if it means shedding our last drop of blood!" The air defense forces vigilantly guarding the capital Hanoi have also issued a powerful vow: "If the American bandits dare to sneak in, we will never let them fly back!" The broad masses of militiamen in North Vietnam, with high morale, are closely cooperating with the People's Army in victorious operations. Their battle slogan is: "Rifles are our anti-aircraft guns, and American planes are living targets!" Last year, the heroic militiamen demonstrated a spirit of bravery and tenacity, using rifles and machine guns to shoot down more than fifty modern American aircraft, working with the air defense forces to destroy America's "air superiority," creating amazing miracles, and demonstrating the great power of people's war and the participation of all people in shooting down aircraft.
    Now, the number of aircraft hunting teams all over North Vietnam has increased several times over last year, and the broad masses of militiamen have become experts in shooting down aircraft. They are full of confidence, becoming more and more experienced, and more and more energetic as they fight. Many militia self-defense teams guarding Route 5 from Hanoi to Haiphong are people's armed forces with a glorious fighting tradition. Many militia heroes from the anti-French war period have now become excellent commanders of the militia self-defense teams. They lead militia teams that are active in combat positions, vowing to "turn this highway into a graveyard for the invading American bandits!"
    Militia self-defense teams in various parts of North Vietnam have also organized thousands of communication groups, stretcher teams, first aid teams, service teams, and transportation groups to serve the battle at any time and any place.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 1st - The General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a communique on the 1st, warmly praising the meritorious units of the military and civilians of North Vietnam for shooting down invading American air bandits on January 31st. The communique said that after playing fake peace tricks for a period of time, the American bandits blatantly sent planes to bomb North Vietnam again on January 31st. In this way, the American bandits once again exposed their ferocious faces.
    The communique said that the military and civilians of North Vietnam, with extreme hatred for the invading American bandits, immediately gave the enemy a fierce counterattack, shooting down five American aircraft and damaging many others in one fell swoop. This feat of arms is a brilliant manifestation of the revolutionary vigilance and firm will of all the military and civilians of North Vietnam to defeat the invading American bandits, and fills all Vietnamese compatriots with incomparable joy and encouragement. This feat of arms and the glorious victories achieved by the heroic Southern military and civilians in the New Year are the deserved punishment for the invading American bandits.
    The communique called on the military and civilians of North Vietnam to deepen their hatred for the American bandits under the just and glorious banner of President Ho Chi Minh's determination to defeat the American invaders, resolutely smash the enemy's offensive, and strive to create more and greater new feats of arms!
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 1st - The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Daily* published a commentary on the 1st, warmly hailing the brilliant feat of arms of the military and civilians of North Vietnam in shooting down five invading American aircraft on January 31st.
    The commentary pointed out that the great early spring victory achieved by the military and civilians of North Vietnam on January 31st shattered the veil of "peace talks" and "suspension of bombing" of American imperialism. Now, the American aggressors' farcical "peace offensive" has been miserably bankrupt. The people of the world have seen their barbaric and bellicose nature more clearly. The commentary concluded by saying, "The American imperialists are frantically advancing their war of aggression. Our armed forces and people must always be vigilant and ready to fight."
   "We must strike the enemy more fiercely and accurately, and shoot down more American aircraft!"

    美国空中强盗来多少打多少
    越南北方军民斗志旺盛决心严惩飞贼
    人民军总部嘉奖击落美机的有功单位
    新华社河内一日电　本社记者报道：越南北方军民一月三十一日奋勇迎击“恢复轰炸”的美国空中强盗，一举击落美国飞机五架。这显示了他们早就看穿了美帝国主义“和谈”骗局，严阵以待和决战决胜的钢铁意志。
    越南人民军防空部队已经展开了热火朝天的打飞机竞赛，决心用第一排炮火就当场击落敌机。曾经在保卫海防市附近的汪秘工业区的战斗中打落敌机七架的防空部队某部的全体指战员，现在又发出英雄的誓言：“不惜流尽最后一滴血，决心为保卫祖国而战！”警惕地守卫着首都河内的防空部队也发出了铿锵的誓言：“美国强盗胆敢钻进来，就决不让它飞回去！”斗志昂扬的越南北方广大民兵，正紧密地配合人民军胜利作战。他们的战斗口号是：“步枪就是我们的高射炮，美国飞机就是活靶子！”英雄的民兵们在去年发扬英勇顽强的战斗精神，曾经用步枪和机枪击落五十多架现代化美国飞机，同防空部队一起打掉美国的“空中优势”，创造了惊人的奇迹，显示了人民战争、全民打飞机的巨大威力。
    现在，遍布越南北方各地的猎机组比去年增加了好几倍，广大民兵已经成了打飞机的能手，他们信心百倍，越打越有经验，越打越有劲。守卫在从河内到海防的第五号公路上的许多民兵自卫队，都是具有光荣战斗传统的人民武装。抗法战争时期的许多民兵英雄，如今已成了民兵自卫队的优秀指挥员。他们率领着一支支民兵队活跃在战斗的岗位上，誓言“要把这条公路变成埋葬美国侵略强盗的坟场！”
    越南北方各地民兵自卫队还组织了成千上万的通讯组、担架组、救护组、服务组和运输组，随时随地为战斗服务。
    新华社河内一日电　越南人民军总司令部一日发表公报，热烈表扬越南北方军民在一月三十一日击落入侵美国强盗飞机的有功单位。公报说，美国强盗经过一段时间玩弄假和平把戏后，于一月三十一日又明目张胆地派遣飞机轰炸越南北方。这样，美国强盗就又一次自我揭穿了他们的狰狞面目。
    公报说，越南北方军民怀着对美国侵略强盗的极度仇恨，立即给敌人以猛烈还击，一举击落美国飞机五架，击伤多架。这一战功，是越南北方全体军民革命警惕性和决心战胜美国侵略强盗的坚强意志的光辉表现，使全越南同胞感到无比的欢欣鼓舞。这一战功和英雄的南方军民在新春取得的辉煌胜利，是对美国侵略强盗的应有惩罚。
    公报号召越南北方军民在胡志明主席的决心战胜美国侵略强盗的正义光辉的旗帜下，加深对美国强盗的仇恨，坚决粉碎敌人的进攻，为创造出更多更巨大的新战功而奋勇前进！
    据新华社河内一日电　越南《人民报》一日发表评论，热烈欢呼越南北方军民一月三十一日击落五架入侵的美国飞机的辉煌战功。
    评论指出，越南北方军民一月三十一日取得的早春大捷，把美帝国主义的“和谈”和“暂停轰炸”的幕布扯得粉碎。现在，美国侵略者的“和平攻势”丑剧已经可悲地破产了。全世界人民更加看清了他们野蛮的好战本性。评论最后说，“美帝国主义者正在疯狂地推进侵略战争。我国的武装部队和人民要始终保持警惕和随时准备战斗。”
   “我们要更狠、更准地打击敌人，打落更多的美国飞机！”
