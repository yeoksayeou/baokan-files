    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 11th: The spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 11th, strongly protesting the British government's provision of Hong Kong to the United States as a base for aggression against Vietnam. The statement also expressed that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports the position clarified in the Chinese government's note of February 1st, protesting the British government's provision of Hong Kong to the United States as a base for expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam and carrying out war threats and nuclear blackmail against China.
    The statement said that on January 26, 1966, the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and the cruiser "Bainbridge," participating in the war of aggression against Vietnam, successively arrived in Hong Kong. On February 1st, these two nuclear-powered warships and three other U.S. military vessels left Hong Kong one after another and sailed to Vietnamese waters to continue their criminal activities against the Vietnamese people.
    The statement pointed out that in 1965, the number of U.S. warships entering Hong Kong reached more than 300 ship-visits. U.S. military aircraft have also increasingly used Hong Kong airport, from where they fly to Nha Trang, Da Nang, and other U.S. air bases in South Vietnam and abroad.
    The statement said, "The above-mentioned events show that the British government has provided Hong Kong to the United States as a military base for carrying out the war of aggression against Vietnam."
    The statement said that as one of the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, the British government has not only failed to fulfill its responsibilities but has also colluded with the United States, blatantly violating this agreement. This extremely serious action by Britain infringes upon the independence and sovereignty of the Vietnamese people, goes against the interests of the British people and Hong Kong residents, and threatens the peace and security of the nations of Indochina and Asia.
    The statement said, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly protests the above-mentioned actions of the British government. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly demands that the British government must fulfill its responsibility as one of the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference, respect the Geneva Accords, and stop turning Hong Kong into a military base for U.S. aggression against Vietnam."
    The statement said, "If the British government continues to blindly follow the imperialist policy of aggression of U.S. imperialism, then it must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising therefrom."

    越南外交部发言人发表声明
    抗议英国提供香港给美国作侵越基地
    新华社河内十一日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人十一日发表声明，强烈抗议英国政府提供香港给美国作为侵略越南的基地。声明并且表示，越南民主共和国政府完全支持中国政府二月一日抗议英国政府提供香港给美国作为扩大侵略越南战争和对中国进行战争威胁和核讹诈的活动基地的照会中所阐明的立场。
    声明说，一九六六年一月二十六日，参加侵略越南战争的美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”和巡洋舰“班布里奇号”相继开抵香港。二月一日，这两艘核动力军舰和其它三艘美国军用船只先后离开香港开到越南海域，继续对越南人民进行罪恶活动。
    声明指出，在一九六五年，进入香港的美国军舰数目达到三百多艘次。美国军用飞机还越来越多地利用香港机场，从那里飞往芽庄、岘港和美国在南越和国外的其它空军基地。
    声明说，“上述事件表明，英国政府已经提供香港给美国作为进行侵略越南战争的军事基地。”
    声明说，作为一九五四年日内瓦会议两主席之一的英国政府，不仅没有履行自己的职责，而且还同美国合伙，明目张胆地违反这一协议。英国的这一极其严重的行动，侵犯了越南人民的独立和主权，违背了英国人民和香港居民的利益，威胁着印度支那和亚洲各民族的和平与安全。
    声明说，“越南民主共和国政府强烈抗议英国政府的上述行动。越南民主共和国政府坚决要求英国政府必须履行作为一九五四年日内瓦会议两主席之一的职责，尊重日内瓦协议，停止把香港变为美国侵略越南的军事基地的行动。”
    声明说，“如果英国政府继续一味追随美帝国主义的侵略政策，那么，它必须对由此而产生的一切严重后果承担全部责任。”
