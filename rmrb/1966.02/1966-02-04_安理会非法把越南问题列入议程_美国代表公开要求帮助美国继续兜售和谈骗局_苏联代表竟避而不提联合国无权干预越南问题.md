    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from New York: Under U.S. manipulation, the United Nations Security Council, at a meeting on the 2nd, passed a U.S. proposal, illegally including the Vietnam question, which the United Nations has absolutely no right to intervene in, on the Security Council's agenda.

    The emergency meeting of the Security Council, which began on the 1st, was convened at the request of the United States. The U.S.'s insistence on the United Nations' intervention in the Vietnam question aroused opposition from some countries at the meeting. Mali's representative, Sory Coulibaly, said in his speech on the 1st that the U.S. resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam "is an extremely conspicuous display of force." He opposed discussing the Vietnam question in the United Nations, pointing out that the Vietnam question can only be resolved based on the Geneva Accords.

    French representative Seydoux also opposed Security Council interference in the Vietnam question. He said that the French government believes that the United Nations is not the appropriate body to discuss the Vietnam question. He pointed out that, with the exception of the United States, other major parties related to the Vietnam question are not represented in the United Nations. He also emphasized that United Nations intervention could only increase confusion. The Vietnam question should be resolved based on the Geneva Accords.

    Ugandan representative Kirande also stated that Uganda could not support submitting the Vietnam question to the Security Council.

    U.S. representative Goldberg delivered a lengthy speech at the beginning of the meeting, repeating the platitudes from his letter of January 31, requesting the Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to discuss the Vietnam question. His speech showed that the U.S.'s presentation of the Vietnam question to the Security Council was an attempt to use the United Nations to continue pushing the U.S.'s bankrupt "peace talk" conspiracy and to cover up the fact that the U.S. is further expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam. He said that the U.S.'s request for the Security Council to consider the Vietnam question does not mark "the end of the peace offensive that the United States 'has been conducting, and that we are determined to continue,' but rather a new aspect of the peace offensive."

    In his speech, Goldberg also once again trotted out the U.S.'s worthless so-called fourteen-point proposal to peddle to the Security Council, and also asked the "United Nations to provide assistance to the United States collectively or individually, through any of its agencies, including the United Nations Secretary-General, in promoting unconditional discussions and negotiations."

    Soviet representative Fedorin hypocritically expressed opposition to the U.S.'s proposal in his speech, but, as the representative of the Soviet Union, one of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, he avoided mentioning that the United Nations has absolutely no right to intervene in the Vietnam question.

    The U.S. proposal to include the Vietnam question on the agenda was passed on the 2nd with nine votes in favor, four abstentions, and two against. The vote in favor included the vote of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. According to Security Council rules, at least nine votes are required to include a question on the agenda, which means that the U.S. obtained only the minimum number of votes required to pass its proposal.

    After the vote, the President of the Security Council, Japanese representative Akira Matsui, suggested that "informal" talks be held among the member states to decide how to conduct the debate. Goldberg said that in order to promote the U.S. conspiracy, the U.S. representative would adopt the "quiet diplomacy" tactics used by the Security Council when it intervened in the India-Pakistan conflict last fall. Obviously considering that the Security Council's discussion would not produce any results, Goldberg played another new trick, saying that "we (the United States) are asking the Security Council to help bring this matter (the Vietnam question) to a Geneva Conference."

    On the same day, spokesmen for the White House and the State Department both advocated reconvening the Geneva Conference.

    安理会非法把越南问题列入议程
    美国代表公开要求帮助美国继续兜售和谈骗局
    苏联代表竟避而不提联合国无权干预越南问题
    新华社三日讯　纽约消息：在美国的操纵下，联合国安全理事会二日在会议上，通过了美国的提案，非法把联合国根本无权干预的越南问题，列入安理会的议程。
    一日开始举行的安理会紧急会议，是根据美国的要求召开的。美国硬要联合国干预越南问题的立场，在会上引起一些国家的反对。马里代表索里·库利巴利一日在发言中说，美国恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸一事，“是极其引人注目的炫耀武力”。他反对在联合国讨论越南问题，指出越南问题只能根据日内瓦协议来解决。
    法国代表赛杜也反对安理会干涉越南问题。他说，法国政府认为联合国不是讨论越南问题的适当机构。他指出，除美国以外，同越南问题有关的其他主要各方面在联合国都没有代表。他还强调，联合国的干涉只能增加混乱。越南问题应当根据日内瓦协议来解决。
    乌干达代表基朗德也表示乌干达不能支持把越南问题提交安理会。
    美国代表戈德堡在会议开始时作了长篇发言，重复他在一月三十一日要求安理会召开紧急会议讨论越南问题的信中的滥调。他的发言表明，美国向安理会提出越南问题是妄图利用联合国来继续推行美国破了产的“和谈”阴谋，并掩盖美国进一步扩大侵越战争的事实。他说，美国要求安理会考虑越南问题，并不标志着美国“一直在进行、而且我们决心要继续进行的和平攻势的告终，而是和平攻势的一个新的方面”。
    戈德堡在发言里还再次搬出美国一钱不值的所谓十四点主张向安理会兜售，并且要“联合国在促成无条件讨论和谈判”方面集体地或个别地、通过它的任何机构，包括联合国秘书长，对美国提供帮助。
    苏联代表费德林在发言中假惺惺地表示反对美国的建议，但是，作为日内瓦会议两主席之一苏联的代表，他避而不提联合国根本无权干预越南问题。
    美国要求把越南问题列入议程的提案在二日表决时以九票赞成、四票弃权、两票反对通过。投赞成票中包括蒋介石集团的一票。根据安理会规定，把问题列入议程起码需要九票，这就是说，美国只取得通过它的提案所需要的最少的票数。
    在表决后，安理会主席、日本代表松井明建议在理事国之间进行“非正式”会谈来决定怎样进行辩论。戈德堡表示，为了推行美国的阴谋，美国代表将采用安理会去年秋季干预印巴冲突问题时采用过的“静悄悄的外交”战术。显然考虑到安理会的讨论将不会产生什么结果，戈德堡又玩弄新花招，说什么“我们（美国）要求安理会帮助使这件事情（越南问题）提到一次日内瓦会议上去。”
    同一天，白宫和国务院发言人都鼓吹重新召开日内瓦会议。
