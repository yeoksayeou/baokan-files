    New Shanghai Textile Products
    Knitted Outerwear - "Qiao Sai"
    When mentioning knitted goods, people always think of socks, cotton undershirts, woolen sweaters, sanitary shirts, and undershirts; but now, Shanghai has successfully trial-produced a variety of knitted outerwear, called "Qiao Sai."
    The "Qiao Sai" already made include men's and women's tops, suit trousers, skirts, jackets, fashion coats, and various children's clothing, all made of cotton yarn, wool, elastic nylon, acrylic and other raw materials blended and interwoven or single-knitted. Their surfaces have embossed patterns, as well as various novel and generous jacquard and woven patterns. This kind of knitted outerwear is thicker, stronger, and more crisp than general knitted underwear, and is elastic; compared with ordinary outerwear, it is lighter, more comfortable, and more beautiful.
    Acrylic Bulky Yarn Fabric
    An acrylic bulky yarn fabric that can rival wool fabrics has been produced in Shanghai. This new product is made by spinning domestic polyacrylonitrile fiber (i.e., artificial wool) after special bulky processing. The yarn and knitted goods such as clothes and hats made of this bulky yarn have a fluffy, soft appearance, are elastic, and have good fastness.
     Foam Plastic Bonded Fabric
    A foam plastic bonded fabric has recently appeared on the Shanghai market. It is made by bonding foam plastic and cloth, and can replace lined silk wadding and cotton to make light, soft, warm, and crisp winter clothing.
    Cold storage workers at the Shanghai Jiangpu Refrigeration Plant wear "cotton-padded jackets" and "cotton-padded trousers" made of this foam plastic bonded fabric in cold storage rooms with temperatures ranging from minus 18 degrees Celsius to minus 20 degrees Celsius, and the cold protection effect is very good, and it is also convenient to wash.
     Fancy Cloth Woven from Slub Yarn
    Shanghai has recently produced a novel and unique fabric called "Fancy Cloth." The surface of the fabric has embossed weaves, giving it a three-dimensional effect. It is woven from a specially made slub yarn.
      General cotton yarn is required to be spun as smooth as possible; slub yarn, however, requires the cotton yarn to be covered with thick, bamboo-like nodes. It is not easy to spin slub yarn. Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 21 modified the spinning frame and created a mechanical device for spinning slub yarn, which enabled this new product to be put into production.
    "Kang Qia" Printed Cloth
    The Jing'an Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory has successfully printed a "Kang Qia" printed cloth.
    "Kang Qia" printed cloth is a fabric loved by the African people. It is the size of a single bed sheet, and the pattern is like a design: large rectangular frames enclosing small rectangular frames, small rectangular frames enclosing circular flowers. The flower shape requires the four corners to be square, the center to be round, the four sides to be symmetrical, and the two sides to be even. Another special requirement of this printed cloth is that the colors must be bright and vivid, and the printing must be done in such a way that the color completely penetrates to the back of the cloth, making it difficult to distinguish between the front and back of the cloth. This very special printed cloth was produced by the staff of Jing'an Factory after dozens of tests with large and small samples.

    上海纺织新产品
    针织外衣——乔赛
    提起针织品，人们想到的总是袜子、棉毛衫、线衫、卫生衫、汗衫等内衣；而现在，上海已试制成功多种针织外衣，名叫“乔赛”。
    已制成的乔赛有男女上装，西装裤，裙子，茄克衫，时装大衣和各式童装等，都是用棉纱、羊毛、弹力锦纶、腈纶等原料混纺交织或单织成的。它们的表面有凹凸花，以及各种新颖大方的提花、织花。这类针织外衣比一般针织内衣厚实、坚牢、挺括，富有弹性；跟通常的外衣比较，更加轻便、舒适、美观。
    腈纶膨体纱织物
    一种可以同羊毛织物嫓美的腈纶膨体纱织物，已在上海生产出来。这种新产品，是利用国产聚丙烯腈纤维（即人造羊毛），进行特殊膨体加工之后纺制成的。用这种膨体纱做成的绒线和织制的衣服、帽子等针织品，外观蓬松、柔软，富有弹性，牢度也好。
     泡沫塑料粘合织物
    上海市场上新出现了一种泡沫塑料粘合织物。它是用泡沫塑料和布粘合而成的，可以代替衬绒丝棉和棉花，做成轻软保暖而挺括的冬季服装。
    上海江浦冷冻厂冷藏工人在摄氏零下十八度至零下二十度的冷藏库里，穿着这种泡沫塑料粘合织物制成的“棉袄”、“棉裤”，御寒效果很好，而且洗涤方便。
     竹节纱织成的花色布
    上海最近做出了一种花式新颖别致的织物，名叫“花色布”。织物表面具有凹凸织纹，富有立体感。它是用一种特制的竹节纱织造成功的。
      一般棉纱要求纺得越光滑越好；竹节纱却要求棉纱上满布竹节似的粗节。要纺出竹节纱很不容易。上海国棉二十
  一厂改装细纱机，创造出一种纺制竹节纱的机械装置，才使这种新产品投入了生产。
    “康茄”花布
    静安棉纺织印染厂印制成功一种“康茄”花布。
    “康茄”花布是非洲人民喜爱的衣料。它的大小象独幅被面，花样象图案：大长方框里套小长方框，小长方框里套圆圈花，花型要求四角方方，中心圆圆，四面对称，两边均匀。这种花布的另一特殊要求是：花色鲜艳明亮，而且印花时要使颜色完全透到布的反面，使布的正反两面看去难以分辨。这种要求很特别的花布，是静安厂职工经过几十次大样小样试验之后制成的。
