    My Green Backpack
    Tang Chaoding, Sorter at Taiyuan Post Office

    My green backpack follows me everywhere every day. Whether the sun is scorching hot or the winter snow is fluttering, crossing great rivers and walking through mountain valleys, I use it to deliver letters and I use it to transmit Party newspapers. A letter connects class friendships; a newspaper is filled with triumphant reports of struggle. My green backpack is truly meritorious. I took it over from my master, and I will use it to serve the people until I am old!

    我的绿背包
    太原邮局分拣员　唐超定我这个绿背包，天天跟着我四处奔跑。不论是骄阳如火，不管是严冬雪飘，跨过大河，走过山坳，我用它去投递信件，我用它去传送党报。一封信，串连阶级情谊，一张报，满载斗争的捷报。我的绿背包，真是有功劳，我从师傅手里接过来，要用它为人民服务到老！
