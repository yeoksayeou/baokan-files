    Under the guidance of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's instructions, leading cadres, scientific and technical personnel, and the vast number of commune members in cotton-growing areas across the country have implemented the "three-way combination," constantly creating and summarizing cotton production experiences, forming a complete set of scientific and technological methods for achieving high cotton yields. At the recent Fifth National Cotton Production Conference convened by the State Council, Comrade Zhu Zemin, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, presented a report summarizing the scientific and technological experiences for achieving high national cotton yields, which was well-received by the delegates. Everyone believed that the various technical measures and suggestions put forward in this report are of great significance for continuing to increase cotton production in our country. The following is a summary of the report.
    Correctly Understanding the Characteristics and Growth Patterns of Cotton
    Although scientists have conducted considerable research on the characteristics and growth patterns of cotton, compared to production practice, the history is short, and the understanding is limited. In the long-term practice of cotton production in our country, especially since liberation, the broad masses and cadres, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have accumulated a wealth of data in more deeply and extensively revealing the characteristics and growth patterns of cotton. The broad masses of cadres and people at the forefront of the cotton production struggle, every time they achieve a bumper harvest and higher and higher yields of cotton, provide a scientific basis for more deeply revealing the objective laws of cotton production.
    Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Contradiction": "According to the viewpoint of dialectical materialism, changes in nature are mainly due to the development of internal contradictions in nature." "This dialectical conception of the universe primarily teaches people to be good at observing and analyzing the contradictory movements of various things and, based on this analysis, to point out methods for resolving contradictions." From Chairman Mao's instructions, it can be understood that cotton itself contains a series of contradictions, of course, including principal contradictions and the principal aspects of contradictions. Analyzing and understanding the principal contradictions and principal aspects of contradictions within cotton itself, and promoting the transformation of contradictions in a direction conducive to increased cotton production, is of great significance for seizing high yields. The summaries of typical experiences for achieving high cotton yields provided by various localities have all profoundly grasped the main contradictions in cotton growth and development, and have proposed many good methods for promoting the transformation of contradictions in a direction that increases production.
    Cotton's main characteristics are three:
    1.  Cotton was originally a perennial plant, but through long-term cultivation and selection by humans, it has developed into an annual crop, but still retains perennial habits. For example, it has deep roots and lush foliage, and a strong ability to regenerate. As long as conditions are met, vegetative growth can continue. In our country, whether in the south or the north, as long as cultivation techniques are correctly applied, it can achieve early growth, stable growth, and prevent premature aging, with great potential for increased production. If it is not properly adjusted, it can easily lead to late development, excessive growth, premature aging, or late maturity.
    2.  In addition to the upward growth of the main stem, cotton branches extend horizontally, and the leaves are large and distributed in layers. The individual growth space and productivity are highly flexible, and growth can be controlled and the contradiction between individual plants and density can be adjusted through measures such as planting density, planting methods, fertilizer and water management, and pruning. If management is untimely or unreasonable, the branches and leaves will grow excessively and luxuriantly, rows will close too early, the cotton field will be shaded, and the contradiction between individuals and the group will increase. (The situation is different for varieties with compact plant shapes.)
    3.  In the growth process of cotton, the time when vegetative growth and reproductive growth overlap and run in parallel is relatively long (up to fifty or sixty days). This is very different from gramineous plants. It can continuously grow roots and leaves, and continuously produce buds and flowers. If mastered well, they can complement each other, which is conducive to striving for more bolls and preventing premature aging. However, there are contradictions in the allocation of nutrients between the two. If not mastered well, it may result in excessive vegetative growth and severe boll shedding, or insufficient vegetative growth and premature aging, both of which make it difficult to achieve high yields.
    The characteristics of cotton are objectively existing. After we understand and grasp them, we can control its development in a favorable direction through management measures. This year, cotton has achieved a bumper harvest, with counties and prefectures achieving average yields of over 100 jin per mu, and high-yield plots exceeding 280 jin. This shows that agricultural scientists and cotton farmers have mastered the characteristics of cotton and have mastered and utilized the laws of cotton growth to achieve high yields.
    The relationship between the different growth stages of cotton and external environmental conditions also differs.
    1.  Sowing Stage (from sowing to emergence): In the northern and southern cotton areas of our country, sowing mostly occurs in mid-to-late April. In normal years, the north is often dry, and the south is often cloudy and rainy. However, in some years, the opposite is true. Due to excessive dryness or wetness, or low temperatures, soil compaction, and the fact that cotton cotyledons are large and difficult to emerge, sowing and emergence are affected. The main contradiction in this stage is: whether it is possible to sow in a timely manner, and whether early, full, and uniform emergence can be achieved.
    The main focus of management in this stage is: to ensure full emergence. By preserving soil moisture, raising temperature, draining waterlogging, and ventilating, the moisture, temperature, and air required for cotton seed germination are met, while preventing soil compaction or seed and bud rot due to low temperatures or excessive moisture, and also preventing phenomena such as dry buds due to lack of moisture and drought.
    In this stage, mature technical measures in various regions include: selecting seeds by grain size and seed treatment, preparing the land to preserve soil moisture, applying sufficient base fertilizer, increasing seed fertilizer according to local conditions, improving sowing quality, sowing in a timely manner, preventing underground pests, and loosening the soil after sowing in case of rain. In areas where cotton and grain are double-cropped, strengthen the management of cotton's preceding crops, support wheat and soybeans, and "tie bundles" in a timely manner before the preceding crop is harvested to increase sunshine and temperature and promote cotton seedling emergence. The overall goal is to ensure full emergence with a single sowing.
    2.  Seedling Stage (from emergence to budding): This stage mostly occurs from May to early and mid-June. The south is in the rainy season of "welcoming the plum," and interplanted cotton seedlings receive little shade and light; the north is dry or the temperature fluctuates unstably. But at this time, vegetative growth must be promoted to prepare conditions for reproductive growth. Therefore, the main contradiction is: solving the problems of diseased seedlings, weak seedlings, or excessively growing and late-developing seedlings, and achieving full, uniform, strong, and early-developing seedlings.
    The main focus of management in this stage is: protecting seedlings and cultivating seedlings, striving for strong seedlings to develop early, and ensuring sufficient, uniform, and even seedlings. Mature technical measures in various regions in this stage include: timely disease prevention and seedling protection; checking seedlings for transplanting and replanting; timely thinning and fixing seedlings; deep cultivation and frequent cultivation to increase soil temperature; topdressing, pest control, and weeding; in cotton fields with a lot of rain and wet ground, and high groundwater levels, ditching, airing the soil, draining waterlogging, lowering the groundwater level, and improving ventilation conditions to promote root development. In wheat and cotton intercropping areas, cotton seedlings are prone to weak and late development. Hubei has the experience of "five earlies" (early loosening of soil, thinning, transplanting, pest control, and topdressing) with early management as the center for wheat and forests, and "four fasts" (fast harvesting of wheat, fast weeding, fast raising of seedlings, and fast pest control) for wheat harvesting. In the northern arid and thin land, seedlings are weak, and seedling fertilizer should be appropriately topdressed to promote early development in the seedling stage.
    3.  Budding and Flowering Stage (from budding to full bloom): This stage has plum rains in the early stage and drought in the later stage in the south, and drought in the early stage and rainy season in the later stage in the north. This is the main period when vegetative growth and reproductive growth proceed simultaneously, especially during the critical period of contradiction transformation from full budding to initial flowering. Excessive fertilizer and water will lead to excessive vegetative growth, which will cause a large amount of boll shedding later; insufficient fertilizer and water will accelerate reproductive growth, which will cause premature aging later. Therefore, the main contradiction is: solving the problem of the unbalanced distribution of nutrients when long branches, long leaves, and budding, flowering, and boll formation proceed simultaneously.
    The main focus of management in this stage is: to achieve stable growth and increased budding. It is necessary to build a good high-yield frame and have enough branches and leaves; and to control row closure around the Great Heat (大暑), to ensure good ventilation and light transmission in the middle and lower parts, and to promote cotton plants to accumulate more nutrients to achieve increased budding and bolling. Mature technical measures in various regions in this stage include: stable application of bud fertilizer in the south, and heavy application of flower and boll fertilizer after one or two bolls are formed; less or no fertilizer and water control during the budding period when there is a lot of rain, and water-regulating fertilizer during the flowering period when there is drought in the dog days. In the northern high-yield cotton fields, we must also pay attention to topdressing during the budding and flowering periods, and heavily apply bud fertilizer in arid and thin land; deep cultivation in the case of heavy rains, and shallow cultivation in the case of drought to resist drought and preserve soil moisture. In northern irrigated areas and southern cotton areas, cultivation combined with soil cultivation after the budding period, consolidating roots and preventing wind, draining water and preventing waterlogging, pruning, and preventing pests during the budding and bolling period. This stage is long and can also be divided into two stages: from budding to initial flowering, and from initial flowering to full bloom. From a management perspective: the budding period should be stable, and the flowering period should be promoted, and management should never be relaxed.
    4.  Bolling Stage (after full bloom): This stage has entered a period of large-scale boll formation, and reproductive growth occupies an absolute advantage. Under normal circumstances, there will be no more excessive growth, and premature aging is likely to occur. If fertilizer and water management is strengthened, the rate of vegetative growth decline can be slowed down, which is conducive to protecting summer bolls, striving for autumn bolls, and forming large bolls. However, when management is improper, cotton fields with good water and fertilizer conditions are prone to excessive vegetative growth and late maturity; cotton fields with poor water and fertilizer conditions, especially arid and thin land in the north, are prone to fertilizer deficiency and premature aging. The main contradiction is: solving the problem of premature aging and late maturity.
    The main focus of management in this stage is: focusing on early maturity and preventing premature aging. Mature technical measures in various regions in this stage include: strengthening late-stage management. In the southern cotton area, topdressing fertilizer should be applied in conjunction with topping; in the northern boll period, appropriate topdressing and irrigation should be combined with shallow cultivation to consolidate summer bolls, increase effective autumn bolls, and increase boll weight.
    To summarize the above points, the growth and appearance of high-yielding cotton is strong seedlings developing early, growing steadily without premature aging. In order to achieve this goal, in cotton fields with good water and fertilizer conditions, we must look at the weather, look at the land, and look at the cotton, and take field management measures centered on promoting - controlling - promoting; in arid and thin hilly cotton fields, we must highlight field management measures that promote the crop from beginning to end. This issue differs somewhat between the north and the south, and even within the same region.
    In recent years, with the development of mass scientific experiment activities centered on demonstration plots, cotton scientific research has achieved many results. In terms of cultivation: summarized comprehensive cultivation techniques for yields of 150 to 200 jin per mu in different regions; planting techniques that grasp the "three bolls" and achieve early development, stable growth, and no premature aging through promotion and control measures; cultivation management techniques that combine soil, fertilizer, and water with dense planting as the center; cultivation management techniques for the early development of strong seedlings in intercropped cotton; and comprehensive technologies for seedling preservation and planting in various types of cotton fields. Wu Jichang, a planting expert and farmer scientist, created techniques for germination promoting and replanting, bud grafting and replanting, seedling transplanting, and soil-covered transplanting, as well as four lines of defense to ensure full seedlings; Yangtan Brigade created tillage techniques for preserving soil moisture and resisting drought; Qidong County's technology of combining land use with land conservation and achieving double harvests of grain and cotton, etc. These achievements were achieved under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and by adopting a three-way combination approach, which is of great significance for continuously achieving high cotton yields and seizing double harvests of grain and cotton in the future.
    Several Key Technical Issues for Achieving High Cotton Yields
    1. The Relationship between Individuals and Groups
    The issue of dense planting occupies a certain position in the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture." However, different crops and different regions also differ in the application of dense planting. The general trend is to develop from sparse to dense. Of course, the so-called sparse and dense are also relative. Ultimately, it is determined by the level of output. As far as the level of cotton yield is concerned, it largely depends on the total number of bolls per unit area. To increase yield per unit area, we must find ways to enable cotton plants to maximize the use of land, nutrients, water, light energy, and growing season. By implementing dense planting, the number of plants per unit area increases, and the total root mass, branches, trunks, and leaves of cotton plants also increase accordingly. More roots mean more nutrients and water are absorbed, and the number of fruit nodes closer to the main stem also increases; more leaves can fully absorb and utilize light energy, thereby increasing the amount of organic nutrients produced. All of these are conducive to increasing the number of bolls and increasing production per unit area.
    Rational dense planting is a factor in increasing production, but it is difficult to mechanically prescribe the upper and lower limits of dense planting. The determination of density should vary depending on region, climate, topography, soil fertility, variety, and cultivation conditions. But the common principle is: on fertile and watered land, resolve the contradiction between the shade created by the increase in the number of plants and the cotton's physiological preference for light. If this is not resolved, it often causes cotton plants to compete for light and bolt upwards, close rows early, shade the cotton field, cause more boll rot in the lower part, more boll shedding in the middle and lower parts, and fewer summer bolls. On arid and thin land, due to low soil fertility and small plants, and fewer bolls per plant, it is necessary to increase the number of plants to strive for an increase in the total number of bolls per unit area; but if it is too dense, the nutrients cannot meet the needs of cotton plants, which will also cause empty plants. To solve these contradictions, it is necessary to determine the corresponding number of plants according to local conditions, and also to ensure that management measures such as fertilizer, water, and pest control keep up after dense planting. Only in this way can the yield-increasing effect of dense planting be brought into play.
    2. The Issue of Increasing Budding and Boll Protection and Preventing Boll Shedding
    According to surveys, the general shedding rate in the northern cotton area reached 50% to 60% last year due to drought (normally more than 60%); in the southern cotton area, it was 60% to 70%. There are many reasons for boll shedding, such as insect pests, diseases, mechanical damage, poor fertilization conditions, and unbalanced distribution of nutrients. In the case of timely pest control, the unbalanced distribution of nutrients is the main reason. The lack of or unbalanced distribution of nutrients in cotton plants is related to the fact that flowering and boll formation consume a lot of fertilizer, but more importantly, it is related to the long period of time that vegetative growth and reproductive growth of cotton proceed in parallel, and there are two nutrient consumption centers. Proper cultivation techniques can gradually weaken the consumption center of vegetative growth, while the consumption center of reproductive growth gradually strengthens, which can increase the boll formation rate; conversely, if the consumption center of vegetative growth remains strong, or declines rapidly, it will cause a large amount of boll shedding due to the lack of sufficient nutrients. Only when the total number of fruit nodes per unit area is greater, and the shedding rate is lower, will the effect of increasing production be greater. The condition for this transformation is that people use comprehensive technical measures to adjust the contradictory relationship between vegetative growth and reproductive growth, and start with increasing budding and reducing shedding to achieve the goal of boll protection and increased production.
    In the past, many experts believed that boll shedding was a physiological reason and an irresistible natural law. This hindered people from fighting against boll shedding. In fact, the shedding rate in some places is only 40% to 50%, while in other places it reaches more than 70%. Reducing it from 70% to 40% has great potential. Currently, there are disputes over the view of boll shedding, which can be further resolved by production practice and scientific research. But it is certain that using cultivation measures to regulate and minimize the shedding rate has great potential for increasing production.
    3. The Relationship between the Three Bolls (Pre-Summer Bolls, Summer Bolls, and Autumn Bolls)
    The relationship between the "three bolls" is an issue that everyone has paid great attention to in recent years. Some say summer bolls are important, some say autumn bolls are important, and some say pre-summer bolls are important. It seems that the proportion of the "three bolls" also varies in different regions. From the experience of various regions, there is a consensus that summer bolls should be the main focus, with attention to both ends. The foundation for stable and high yields lies in summer bolls; to strive for higher yields, we must pay attention to both ends.
    The key to high cotton yields lies in forming more "three bolls." Farmers' estimates of the role of these "three bolls" are: pre-summer bolls are a sign of early development and stable growth, summer bolls ensure a bumper harvest, and autumn bolls strive for higher yields. If pre-summer bolls are formed, the cotton plant will generally not grow excessively, and we will dare to use fertilizer and water to promote growth, which is also conducive to striving for early maturity. Although the number of pre-summer bolls is small, forming one more boll per plant can increase production by 15 jin of lint cotton per mu, calculated at 5,000 plants per mu, which is also an indispensable component of increasing production. Regardless of the south or the north, summer bolls account for a large proportion and are the main body of yield. Autumn bolls account for a significant proportion, which is a link in striving for higher yields. However, the proportion of autumn bolls is closely related to the local frost period. Generally, in the north, due to the short frost-free period, if autumn bolls account for a large proportion, it is easy to increase post-frost flowers, which is not conducive to improving quality. At the same time, in areas where cotton and wheat are double-cropped in rotation, a large proportion of autumn bolls will also affect the normal sowing of the next crop. Therefore, from the perspective of the relationship between the "three bolls" and yield composition, summer bolls should be the main focus, with attention to both ends.
    The cotton plant itself also has a certain ability to regulate the distribution of boll formation. Under certain cultivation conditions, if more bolls are formed in the early stage or at the base, the number of bolls formed in the later stage will be relatively reduced; conversely, if there is severe shedding in the early stage or at the base, and not many bolls are formed, the boll formation rate in the later stage or at the top will be very high. Therefore, as long as we understand the law of boll formation in cotton, whether in the south or the north, whether in dry years or flood years, whether the early stage is favorable and the later stage is unfavorable, or the early stage is unfavorable and the later stage is favorable, we can ensure a certain number of bolls formed and achieve high yields. There is a lot of room for people to exert their initiative in this regard. Of course, from the overall situation, in order to take the initiative, we must strive to form bolls early and form more and larger bolls before and during the summer period, so as to avoid being passive in the later stage, which is of greater significance for extra-early maturing cotton areas with a short frost-free period.
    4. Struggle against Diseases, Insect Pests, and Other Natural Disasters
    There are many types and large numbers of cotton diseases and insect pests, and the damage period is long. In recent years, new changes have emerged. For example, in the southern cotton area, due to changes in cropping systems such as intercropping and replanting, there are crops in the fields all year round, and snails have abundant feed, resulting in unprecedented rampant snails; in the northern cotton area, the overwintering base of cotton aphids is large, the early spring proliferation rate is high, and the area of cotton seedlings destroyed by spring floods has increased, thus promoting increasingly severe damage; resistant cotton aphids in the north and resistant spider mites in the south have also brought new difficulties to prevention and control work. This shows the arduousness and complexity of the struggle against diseases and insect pests. However, the national cotton area has strengthened organizational leadership, combined forecasting work with mass surveys of diseases and insect pests, emphasized comprehensive prevention and control and the quality of prevention and control, which has played a guarantee role in the high yield of cotton. Through several years of practice in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, not only has there been new progress in prevention and control technology, but also the understanding of fighting against diseases and insect pests has been improved. In the practice of constantly fighting against diseases and insect pests, a series of methods for preventing and controlling resistant pests has been summarized, and it has been clarified that the application of internal absorption agents to treat seeds in large areas of cotton fields, the rotation of several kinds of pesticides, and the emphasis on spraying the pesticide solution on the back of cotton leaves to contact the insect body can play a certain control effect on the growth of drug resistance. For cotton yellow and verticillium wilt, the method of "knowing, checking, and handling at the same time" has been adopted, which has attracted the attention of the broad masses and created many feasible prevention and control measures. Through the practice of preventing and controlling cotton diseases and insect pests, it has also been recognized that with the changes in cotton production conditions, the occurrence patterns of diseases and insect pests will also change accordingly, and new problems will arise. Therefore, our prevention and control strategies must develop with the changes in the objective enemy situation in order to grasp the initiative in the struggle and remain invincible.
    Arid and thin land, saline-alkali low-lying land, and hilly land account for a considerable area of cotton-growing areas in our country. Carrying out farmland capital construction in the spirit of Dazhai and transforming these low-yield cotton fields is an important measure to achieve a balanced increase in cotton production, and it is also a long-term plan to achieve stable and high yields. Local experience proves that only if farmland capital construction is solid, and farmland with deep and fertile soil layers, flat ground, and the ability to irrigate and drain is built, can the threat of drought and flood be lifted.
    Scientific and Technical Issues of Achieving Double Harvests of Grain and Cotton
    Growing cotton cannot rely on the state to supply grain. It is necessary to achieve double harvests of grain and cotton, which is of far-reaching strategic significance. There are many examples of double harvests of grain and cotton in various regions. From the actual situation in various regions, there are basically four ways to achieve double harvests of grain and cotton:
    The first is to implement cotton and wheat intercropping on a unit area, two crops a year.
    The second is to implement grain and cotton rotation on a unit area, four crops in two years.
    The third is to implement strip intercropping of grain and cotton on a unit area, "half wheat, half cotton."
    The fourth is to implement single cropping of grain and cotton to achieve double harvests in a production unit (commune or production brigade, production team). The important issue is that we must first emphasize having a surplus of grain for self-sufficiency, and promote cotton with grain, in order to ensure stable and high cotton yields. In the north, implement grain to protect cotton, and cotton to promote grain, to promote double harvests of grain and cotton.
    Many typical experiences of double harvests of grain and cotton prove that to continuously achieve double harvests of grain and cotton, it is necessary to combine land use with land conservation, take measures such as planting green manure crops, increasing the application of organic fertilizer, and implementing rotation with leguminous crops to cultivate the soil, in order to ensure continuous double harvests of grain and cotton year after year. To achieve double harvests of grain and cotton, actively developing green manure is an important measure, and it is still necessary to further strengthen the research and promotion of green manure development in the future.
    In order to further seize high and higher yields of grain and cotton, scientific and technical workers on the cotton science front must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, highlight politics, realize the ideological revolutionization and the revolutionization of research methods, continue to go deep into production practice, contact the masses, carry out mass cotton science experiment activities centered on demonstration plots, implement the three-way combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and the masses, vigorously promote demonstration plots, comprehensively apply the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture," and reform cotton planting technology. This is an important content of my country's cotton science service production, and it is also a powerful way to promote the further popularization and improvement of cotton planting technology in my country. In the future, cotton scientific research work must, on the one hand, continue to adhere to the center of demonstration plots, more widely and solidly carry out mass scientific experiment activities, seriously and systematically summarize mass experience, and promote it in a timely manner; on the other hand, it must also strengthen systematic scientific research to better serve cotton production and make new contributions to the development of cotton science in our country.

    全国棉花丰产科学技术经验总结
    中国农业科学院副院长朱则民在第五次全国棉花生产会议上的报告
    我国各地领导干部、科学技术人员和广大棉区社员，遵照党中央和毛主席的指示，实行三结合，不断创造和总结棉花生产经验，形成了一整套棉花丰产的科学技术。在最近国务院召开的第五次全国棉花生产会议上，中国农业科学院副院长朱则民同志作了全国棉花丰产经验科学技术总结报告，受到代表们的好评。大家认为，这个报告中提出的各项技术措施和意见，对我国棉花继续增产具有重大意义。下面是这个报告的摘要。
    正确认识棉花的特性和生育特点
    关于棉花的特性和生育特点，科学家虽然作过不少研究，但比起生产实践来说，历史短，认识是有限的。我国在棉花生产的长期实践中，特别是解放以来，广大群众和干部在毛泽东思想的指引下，在更深入、更广泛地揭示棉花的特性和生育特点方面，积累了大量资料。处于棉花生产斗争第一线的广大干部和群众，每一次取得棉花丰收和高产更高产，都是为更深入地揭示棉花生产的客观规律，提供了科学根据。
    毛主席在《矛盾论》中指出：“按照唯物辩证法的观点，自然界的变化，主要地是由于自然界内部矛盾的发展。”“这个辩证法的宇宙观，主要地就是教导人们要善于去观察和分析各种事物的矛盾的运动，并根据这种分析，指出解决矛盾的方法。”从毛主席的指示，可以理解棉花自身也包含着一系列的矛盾，当然也有主要矛盾和主要的矛盾方面。分析认识棉花自身的主要矛盾和主要的矛盾方面，推动矛盾向有利于棉花增产的方面转化，这对夺取高产有着重要意义。各地所提供的棉花丰产典型经验总结，都很深刻地抓住了棉花生长发育的主要矛盾，并提出了很多推动矛盾向增产方面转化的好办法。
    棉花的主要特性有三：
    1、棉花原来是多年生的植物，经过人类长期培育选择，发展成为一年生的作物，但是仍有多年生的习性。例如：根深叶茂，再生能力强，只要条件具备，营养生长可以延续进行。在我国不论南方或北方，只要正确运用栽培技术，可以早发，稳长，不早衰，增产潜力很大；如果调节得不好，很容易形成迟发，徒长，早衰或晚熟。
    2、棉花除主茎向上长外，枝条横向伸长，叶片大、层列分布，个体生长空间和生产力的伸缩性很大，可以通过种植密度、种植方式、肥水管理和整枝打杈等措施，控制长势，调节单株和密度之间的矛盾；如果管理不适时或不合理，就会枝叶徒长繁茂，过早封行，棉田荫蔽，个体和群体之间的矛盾就会加大。（株形紧凑的品种，情况又有所不同。）
    3、棉花在生长过程中，营养生长和生殖生长重叠并行的时间较长（达五六十天），这一点和禾本科有很大不同。它能够不断生根生叶，不断现蕾开花。掌握得好，可以相辅相成，有利于争取多结桃，不早衰；但是，两者的营养分配有矛盾，如掌握得不好，可能形成营养生长过旺，蕾铃脱落严重，或者营养生长不足而早衰，都难以高产。
    棉花的特性是客观存在，我们认识掌握之后，就能够通过管理措施，控制它向有利方面发展。今年棉花获得大丰收，出现了平均亩产百斤以上的县、专区，以及二百八十斤以上的高产田块。这说明农业科学工作者和棉农是掌握了棉花的特性，掌握和利用了棉花的生育规律而获得高产的。
    棉花的不同生育阶段与外界环境条件的矛盾关系也有所不同。
    1、播种阶段（播种到出苗）：我国南北棉区，多在四月中、下旬播种，常年北方多旱，南方多阴雨。但也有的年份相反，由于过干过湿或低温、土壤板结，加以棉花子叶较大，顶土费劲的特点，而影响播种出苗，这一阶段的主要矛盾是：能否适期播种，以及获得早苗、全苗、齐苗的问题。
    这个阶段在管理上的主攻方向是：抓全苗。通过保墒、提温、排渍、通气，满足棉种发芽所需的水分、温度和空气，同时防止土壤板结或因低温、过湿而烂籽、烂芽，也要防止缺墒受旱干芽等现象。
    各地在这个阶段，成熟的技术措施有：粒选种子和种子处理，整地保墒，施足底肥，因地制宜地增施种肥，提高播种质量，适期播种，防治地下害虫，播后遇雨松土等。棉粮两熟地区，加强棉花前作的管理，扶理麦豆，在前作收获前，适时“扎把”，增加日照、温度，促进棉苗出土。总的目标是达到一次播种保证全苗。
    2、苗期阶段（出苗到现蕾）：这一阶段多在五月到六月上、中旬，南方处于“迎黄梅”的多雨时期，套种棉苗，受荫蔽少光；北方干旱或温度变化不稳。但这时必须促进营养生长，为生殖生长准备条件，因此主要矛盾是：解决病苗、弱苗或旺苗晚发的问题，达到苗全、苗匀、苗壮、早发。
    这个阶段在管理上的主攻方向是：保苗培苗，力争壮苗早发，并且苗足、苗匀、苗齐。各地在这个阶段成熟的技术措施有：及时防病保苗；查苗补种、移栽；及时间苗、定苗；深中耕勤中耕，提高地温；追肥、治虫、除草；雨多地湿和地下水位高的棉田，开沟晾墒、排渍、降低地下水位，改善通气条件，促进根系发育。棉麦套种地区，棉苗容易形成苗弱迟发，湖北有以早管为中心的麦林“五早”（早松土、间苗、移苗、治虫、追肥）和麦收“四快”（快割麦、快锄草、快提苗、快治虫）的经验；北方旱薄地苗弱，要适当追施苗肥，促进苗期早发。
    3、蕾花期阶段（现蕾到盛花）：这一阶段南方前期梅雨、后期伏旱，北方前期干旱、后期进入雨季，此时是营养生长和生殖生长并进的主要时期，特别是在盛蕾到初花的矛盾转化的关键时期，肥水过多则营养生长过旺，就会造成以后的蕾铃大量脱落；肥水不足则生殖生长加速，就会造成以后的早衰。因此，主要矛盾是：解决长枝、长叶和现蕾、开花、结铃并进时营养物质分配不平衡的问题。
    这个阶段在管理上的主攻方向是：实现稳长增蕾。既要搭好丰产架子，有足够的枝叶；又要控制封行在大暑前后，保证中、下部通风透光良好，促进棉株多积累营养物质，达到增蕾增铃。各地在这个阶段成熟的技术措施有：南方稳施蕾肥，结住一两个成铃后，重施花铃肥，蕾期多雨以少施或不施肥控水，花期伏旱以水调肥。北方丰产棉田也要重视蕾期、花期追肥，旱薄地重施蕾肥；多雨深中耕、天旱浅中耕，抗旱保墒。北方水浇地和南方棉区，蕾期以后中耕结合培土，固根防风、排水防渍、整枝，防治蕾铃期害虫。这个阶段时间长，也可以划分为现蕾到初花和初花到盛花两个阶段，从管理来说：蕾期要稳，花期要促，始终不能放松管理。
    4、铃期阶段（盛花以后）：这一阶段已进入大量结铃时期，生殖生长占绝对优势，在一般情况下，已不会再出现旺长，而容易出现早衰。如果加强肥水管理，可以缓和营养生长衰退的速度，有利于保伏桃，争秋桃，结大桃。但管理不当时，水肥条件好的棉田容易出现贪青晚熟；水肥条件差的棉田，尤其是北方旱薄地，容易出现脱肥、早衰。主要矛盾是：解决早衰与迟熟的问题。
    这个阶段在管理上的主攻方向是：着重抓早熟，不早衰。各地在这个阶段成熟的技术措施有：加强后期管理。南方棉区结合打顶补施盖顶肥；北方铃期适当追肥和灌水，并结合浅中耕，巩固伏桃，增加有效秋桃和提高铃重。
    概括上面所说各点，丰产棉花的长势长相是壮苗早发、稳长不早衰。为了达到这个目的，在水肥条件好的棉田，要看天、看地、看棉花，采取促——控——促为中心的田间管理措施；在旱薄丘陵的棉田，要突出一促到底的田间管理措施。这个问题南北方有所不同，就是在同一地区也有不同。
    近几年来，随着以样板田为中心的群众性科学实验活动的开展，棉花科学研究方面取得不少成果。在栽培方面：总结出不同地区亩产一百五十斤到二百斤以上的综合栽培技术；抓“三桃”和通过促控措施达到早发稳长、不早衰的植棉技术；以密植为中心的土、肥、水相结合的栽培管理技术；套种棉花壮苗早发的栽培管理技术；各类棉田播种保苗的综合技术。植棉能手、农民科学家吴吉昌创造的催芽补种、贴芽补种、芽苗移栽和带土移栽以及四道防线保全苗的技术；杨谈大队创造的耕作保墒抗旱技术；启东县的用地养地结合，粮棉双丰收的技术等。这些成果，都是在毛主席思想指导下，采取三结合的方式取得的，对今后棉花不断高产和夺取粮棉双丰收，有着重要意义。
    夺取棉花高产的几个关键技术问题
    一、个体与群体的关系
    密植问题在“农业八字宪法”中占有一定位置。但不同作物、不同地区在运用密植上也有所不同，总的趋势是由稀向密发展的。当然所谓稀、密也是相对而言的，归根到底最后决定于产量高低。就棉花产量高低来说，在很大程度上决定于单位面积总桃数的多少。提高单产，就要设法促使棉株能够最大限度地利用地力、养分、水分、光能和生长季节。实行密植，单位面积上株数增加，棉株总根量、枝干和叶片也随着增多。根量多，吸收的养分和水分就多，靠近主干的果节数也多；叶片多，能充分吸收利用光能，从而制造的有机养料增多。所有这些，都有利于单位面积增桃、增产。
    合理密植是增产的一个因素，但是密植的上限和下限很难机械规定。密度的确定，应因地区、气候、地势、地力、品种和栽培条件而有所不同。但共同的原则是：在肥水地上，解决由于株数增加造成群体遮荫和棉花生理上喜光之间的矛盾。如果解决不好，往往造成棉株争光上窜，早封垄，棉田荫蔽，下部烂铃多，中、下部脱落多，伏桃少。在旱薄地上，由于土壤肥力低，植株小，单株结铃少，就要通过增加株数，争取单位面积的总铃数增多；但过密时，营养不能满足棉株需要，也会造成空棵。解决上述这些矛盾，既要因地制宜确定相应的株数，又要在密植后，使肥、水、治虫等管理措施跟上。只有这样，才能发挥密植的增产作用。
    二、增蕾保铃与防止蕾铃脱落问题
    据调查，一般脱落率，北方棉区在去年天旱情况下，达百分之五十到百分之六十（常年为百分之六十以上）；南方棉区百分之六十到百分之七十。蕾铃脱落的原因很多，如虫害、病害、机械损伤、受精条件不良、营养物质分配不平衡等等。在治虫及时的情况下，营养物质分配不平衡的原因是主要的。引起棉株体内营养物质不足或分配不平衡，这一方面与开花结铃耗肥较多有关，但更重要的是与棉花本身营养生长和生殖生长并进时间长，存在两个营养物质消耗中心有关。栽培技术处理得当，营养生长的消耗中心由强逐渐转弱，而生殖生长的消耗中心由弱逐渐转强，可以增加成铃率；反之，出现营养生长的消耗中心一直很强，或者迅速下降，都会造成蕾铃因得不到足够的营养物质而造成大量脱落。只有在单位面积上总果节数越多，脱落率越低，则增产的效果就会越大。这个转化的条件是人通过综合的技术措施，调整好营养生长和生殖生长并进的矛盾关系，从增蕾与减少脱落入手，达到保铃增产的目的。
    过去有不少专家认为蕾铃脱落是生理原因，是不可抗拒的自然法则。这就阻碍了人们与蕾铃脱落作斗争。事实上，有的地方脱落率仅有百分之四五十，有的地方达百分之七十以上。从百分之七十压低到百分之四十就有很大潜力。目前对脱落的观点有争论，这可以有待生产实践和科学研究去进一步解决。但可以肯定，利用栽培措施调节，把脱落率降低到最小限度，这对生产来说，增产潜力是很大的。
    三、三桃（伏前桃、伏桃、秋桃）的关系问题
      “三桃”的关系，是近年大家都十分重视的一个问题。有的说伏桃重要，有的说秋桃重要，有的说伏前桃重要。看来，不同地区“三桃”的比重也有所不同。对于“三桃”的关系，从各地经验来看，一致认为应以伏桃为主，抓两头。稳产高产的基础放在伏桃上；争取更高的产量，要抓两头。
    棉花丰产关键在于多结“三桃”。农民对这“三桃”作用的估价是：伏前桃是早发、稳长的标志，伏桃保丰产，秋桃争取更高产。座住了伏前桃，一般情况下棉株就不会再旺长，就敢于用肥、水促进生长，同时也有利于争取早熟。伏前桃尽管数量少，每株多座一个桃，以每亩五千株计算，即可增产十五斤皮棉，也是增产不可忽视的构成部分。不论南方、北方，伏桃所占比重都大，是构成产量的主体。秋桃所占比重不小，这是争取更高产的一环。但秋桃比重大小与当地霜期早晚关系重大，一般北方因无霜期短，如秋桃比重大，容易增加霜后花，对提高品质是不利的。同时，在棉麦两熟连作地区，秋桃比重过大，也会影响下茬的正常播种。所以从“三桃”对产量构成的关系来看，应该是以伏桃为主，抓两头。
    棉株本身对结铃的分布也有一定的调节能力，在一定栽培条件下，如果前期或基部结铃多，后期成铃数就相对减少；反之，前期或基部脱落严重，没有座住很多桃，则后期或顶部成铃率就很高。因此，只要认识了棉花的成铃规律，不论南方、北方，不论旱年、涝年，前期有利、后期不利，或前期不利、后期有利等等情况下，都能够保证一定的成铃数而高产。这方面发挥人的能动性的余地很大。当然，从总的情况来说，为了争取主动，要力争在伏前和伏期早成桃、多成桃、成大桃，以免后期被动，这点对无霜期短的特早熟棉区有着更重要的意义。
    四、同病虫和其他自然灾害作斗争
    棉花病虫种类多，数量大，为害期长，近几年又出现了新的变化。例如南方棉区由于套作复种等耕作制度的改变，终年田间都有作物，蜗牛的饲料充沛，造成空前猖獗；北方棉区棉蚜越冬基数大，早春增殖率高，加以春涝毁种面积增多，因此大面积棉苗的生育阶段参差不齐，促成为害日益加重；北方的抗性棉蚜和南方的抗性红蜘蛛，也给防治工作带来了新的困难。这说明与病虫作斗争的艰巨性和复杂性。但是，全国棉区由于加强了组织领导，测报工作和群众性的病虫普查相结合，强调了综合防治和防治质量，对棉花的丰产起到了保证作用。通过几年来防治病虫的实践，不仅在防治技术上有了新的进展，并且也提高了和病虫作斗争的认识。在不断同病虫害作斗争的实践中，已总结出一系列防治抗性害虫的办法，并且明确了大面积棉田应用内吸剂处理种子，若干种农药轮换使用，强调把药液喷到棉叶背面、接触虫体，对抗药性的增长能起到一定的控制效果。对棉花黄、枯萎病，采取了“边认识、边检查、边处理”的办法，引起广大群众的重视，创造出不少可行的防治措施。通过防治棉花病虫害的实践，也认识到随着棉花生产条件的改变，病虫的发生规律也会相应地有所变化，而出现新的问题。因此，我们的防治策略，必须随着客观敌情的变化而发展，才能掌握斗争的主动权，立于不败之地。
    我国棉区旱薄地、盐碱洼涝地、丘陵岗地占有相当大的面积，以大寨精神搞好农田基本建设，改造这些低产棉田，这是实现棉花平衡增产的一个重要措施，也是实现稳产高产的长远之计。各地经验证明，只有农田基本建设关过得硬，建设起土层深厚肥沃，地面平整，能灌能排的农田，才能解除旱涝威胁。
    粮棉双丰收的科学技术问题
    种棉花，不能靠国家供应粮食，一定要实现粮棉双丰收，这是具有深远战略意义的。各地有很多粮棉双丰收的事例。从各地的实际情况来看，达到粮棉双丰收的途径，基本上有四种：
    第一种是在单位面积上实行棉麦套作，一年两熟。
    第二种是在单位面积上实行粮棉轮作，两年四熟。
    第三种是在单位面积上实行粮棉带状间作，“半麦、半棉”。
    第四种是在一个生产单位（公社或生产大队、生产队）内实行粮棉单作双丰收。重要的问题是首先要强调粮食自给有余，以粮促棉，才能保证棉花稳产高产。在北方实行以粮保棉，以棉促粮，推动粮棉双丰收。
    很多粮棉双丰收的典型经验证明，要持续不断地取得粮棉双丰产，必须用地结合养地，采取种植绿肥作物，增施有机肥，以及实行与豆科作物轮作等培肥土壤，以保证连年取得粮棉双丰收。要实现粮棉双丰收，积极发展绿肥是一项重要措施，今后还需要进一步加强发展绿肥的研究和推广工作。
    为了进一步夺取粮棉高产更高产，棉花科学战线的科学技术工作者，必须更好地活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，实现思想革命化，研究方法革命化，继续深入生产实际，联系群众，开展以样板田为中心的群众性棉花科学实验活动，实行领导干部、技术人员和群众三结合，大搞样板田，综合运用“农业八字宪法”，改革植棉技术。这是我国棉花科学服务生产的重要内容，也是有力地推动我国植棉技术进一步普及与提高的主要途径。今后的棉花科学研究工作，一方面仍要坚持以样板田为中心，更加广泛而扎实地开展群众性的科学实验活动，认真地系统总结群众经验，及时加以推广；另方面也要加强系统性的科学研究，更好地为棉花生产服务，为我国棉花科学的发展做出新贡献。　（新华社）
