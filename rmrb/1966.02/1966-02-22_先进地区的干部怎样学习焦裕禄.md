　　The Response of Cadres in Cangxi County: We must learn with humility, and like Jiao Yulu, use the principle of "one divides into two" as taught by Chairman Mao to examine our own thoughts and work, prevent arrogance and complacency, and wholeheartedly serve the people to the very end.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, February 21st, how should cadres in advanced regions, where significant achievements have been made in production and construction and people's lives have improved remarkably, learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu? The leading cadres of Cangxi County, an advanced county in the northern mountainous area of Sichuan Province, replied: We must learn with humility, and like Comrade Jiao Yulu, use the principle of "one divides into two" as taught by Chairman Mao to examine our own thoughts and work, prevent arrogance and complacency, and resolve to "be a lifelong hired hand for the people of the mountainous area."
    In 1965, the total grain output of Cangxi County exceeded the highest level in history, and a new situation of comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry emerged. Therefore, the county has been praised as a "good example of taking grain as the key link, combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, engaging in diversified operations, developing comprehensively, and conscientiously implementing the general line." People from all over Southwest China have come here to visit and learn from its experience.
    Just as the Cangxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China was considering and studying the current production and work of the county, newspapers carrying the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu arrived. Chen Liang, the Secretary of the County Committee, studied the article "The Model of a County Party Secretary - Jiao Yulu" until after 3 a.m., and wrote down his心得 (xinde, insights): "Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, serve the people thoroughly." Under his leadership, the leading cadres of the County Committee earnestly studied the article and, in light of their own practical situations, held discussions to find shortcomings by using Jiao Yulu as a mirror.
    In the course of study and discussion, they realized that when Jiao Yulu was in Lankao, he used Chairman Mao's thought of "one divides into two" to see the light and the future in the face of difficulties. Today, they must also follow Chairman Mao's teaching and view the situation in Cangxi from the perspective of "one divides into two." Chen Liang, the Secretary of the County Committee, said that Mao Zedong Thought tells us that things always divide into two and develop in contradictions; without contradictions, there can be no progress. The County Committee leadership should have this awareness, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and discover new contradictions when achievements are made so that they can proactively lead the masses to advance in a timely manner. He said that in the face of achievements, dividing one into two and continuing to advance means using one's own words and actions to explain to cadres and the masses that serving the people is not a matter of one day or two, but a lifelong task. The achievements we made in the past by engaging in revolutionary struggle with the masses have now become history. How things will be in the future requires us to start anew and accept the test from the beginning.
    The comrades of the County Committee improved their understanding through study and discussion, and then, in light of their own practical situations, examined their work. They realized that some leading cadres had been busy with office work for some time and had not gone deep into the grassroots level, which could lead to the danger of being divorced from reality and the masses. Some communes and teams, seeing that the seedlings of the spring crops were in good condition, had become complacent, and the preparatory work for spring plowing in some communes and teams was not being grasped tightly enough. These all showed that in a favorable situation, ideological tendencies of not caring about the interests of the masses had emerged.
    In response to this situation, the County Committee particularly emphasized that leaders at all levels should go deep into the grassroots level, strengthen investigation and research, highlight politics, establish the idea of "being a lifelong hired hand for the people of the mountainous area," and serve the people wholeheartedly to the very end, like Comrade Jiao Yulu. At the same time, it arranged for the current work. First, all cadres in the county should combine the study of Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds with finding shortcomings and further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, focusing on putting it into "use." Second, from the bottom up, sum up the experiences and lessons of 1965, and while affirming achievements, find shortcomings and gaps. First of all, leading cadres at all levels should find gaps in ideology, work methods, and work style, and earnestly improve them. Third, strengthen leadership over current production. Leading cadres of the county, districts, communes, and brigades should "dig in," like Comrade Jiao Yulu, not eat food that others have chewed, pay attention to grasping first-hand information, grasping living ideas, and personally engage in the work of mobilizing the masses to do a good job in production. Fourth, promptly check the difficulties of the commune members in the current production, care about the lives of the masses, pay attention to promoting democracy and combining work with rest when the enthusiasm of the masses is high, and cherish the enthusiasm of the masses.

　　先进地区的干部怎样学习焦裕禄
　　苍溪县干部回答是：一定要虚心学，象焦裕禄那样，按照毛主席的教导，用一分为二的观点，检查自己的思想和工作，防止骄傲自满，全心全意为人民服务到底
    据新华社成都二十一日电  在生产建设取得重大成就、群众生活获得显著改善的先进地区的干部，应该以怎样的态度学习焦裕禄同志？四川北部山区一个先进县——苍溪县的领导干部回答是：一定要虚心学，学习焦裕禄同志那样，按照毛主席的教导，用一分为二的观点，检查自己的思想和工作，防止骄傲自满，决心“为山区人民当一辈子长工”。
    苍溪县一九六五年的粮食总产量超过了历史最高水平，出现了农林牧全面发展的新局面。因此，这个县已被人们赞扬为“以粮为纲，农林牧结合，多种经营，全面发展，认真贯彻执行总路线的好样板”。西南各地纷纷派人到这里参观取经。
    当中共苍溪县委正在考虑、研究当前全县的生产、工作时，载有焦裕禄同志光辉事迹的报纸来到了这里。县委书记陈亮学《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》这篇文章直到深夜三点多钟，写下了“向焦裕禄同志学习，彻底为人民服务”的心得。在他的带动下，县委领导干部都认真学习，并且联系实际，进行座谈讨论，以焦裕禄为镜子，找了差距。
    在学习讨论中，他们认识到，焦裕禄同志在兰考时，用毛主席一分为二的思想，在困难当中，看到了光明，看到了前途；今天，他们也一定要按照毛主席的教导，一分为二地看待苍溪的形势。县委书记陈亮说，毛泽东思想告诉我们，事物总是一分为二的，在矛盾中发展的，没有矛盾就不能前进。县委领导应该象焦裕禄同志那样，有这样的自觉，要在取得胜利的时候去发现新的矛盾，这样才能主动地带领群众及时前进。他说，在成绩面前，一分为二，继续前进，那就是用自己的言行向干部和群众说明：我们为人民，不是一朝一夕的事，而是终身的任务。过去跟群众一道进行革命斗争获得些成绩，现在已经变成历史，今后怎样，还要重新做起，从头接受考验。
    县委的同志们从学习讨论中提高了认识，又联系实际，检查了工作。他们认识到：前段时间，有些领导干部忙于机关工作，没有很好深入基层，这样下去，有脱离实际、脱离群众的危险；部分社队看到小春作物苗状不错，有麻痹思想，还有些社、队的备耕工作抓得不紧。这些都说明在顺利的形势下，出现了不关心群众利益的思想苗头。
    根据这一情况，县委特别强调各级领导要深入下去，加强调查研究，突出政治，树立“为山区人民当一辈子长工”的思想，象焦裕禄同志那样，全心全意为人民服务到底。同时，安排了当前的工作。第一，全县干部结合学习焦裕禄同志的事迹，找出差距，进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，在“用”字上狠下功夫。第二，自下而上总结一九六五年的经验教训，在肯定成绩时，找出缺点和差距。首先是各级领导干部要在思想上、工作方法和工作作风上找出差距，切实改进。第三，对当前生产加强领导。县、区、公社、大队的领导干部要“扎”下去，象焦裕禄同志那样不吃别人嚼过的馍，注意抓第一手资料，抓活思想，亲手去做发动群众搞好生产的工作。第四，及时检查社员在当前生产中的困难，关心群众生活，在群众情绪高涨的时候注意发扬民主，劳逸结合，爱护群众的积极性。
