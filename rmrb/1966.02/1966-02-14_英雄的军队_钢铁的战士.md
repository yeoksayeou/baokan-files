    Heroic Army, Steel Warriors
    Who is the Master of the Dry Season?
    The incessant torrential rains in the forests are gone, and the wind has become soft and warm; the vast accumulation of water in the Plain of Reeds is receding day by day, revealing newly green broadleaf grasses; the Mekong Delta, under a boundless blue sky, hangs a fiery sun from morning till night.
    The rainy season has passed. After frequent offensives and successive great victories, the South Vietnam Liberation Army soldiers are taking advantage of the lull in battle to wash their damp clothes, sun their hammocks, and prepare for new battles.
    The rainy season has passed, and the enemy is stirring. The American aggressors and their Saigon puppets are screaming themselves hoarse every day, "The Viet Cong's rainy season is over," "Our dry season has arrived," "Utilize our land and air superiority to change the battlefield situation in the dry season." This foreshadows severe battles to come.
    Last year, amidst the U.S.-puppet clique's cries of a "dry season offensive," we crossed the wide Saigon River and went to the Saigon front. In broad daylight, we walked on the highway connecting the suburbs of Saigon. Large-wheeled ox carts transporting grain replaced the usual streamlined cars. Children dressed in colorful clothes waved and welcomed the Liberation Army at the village entrance, their faces full of smiles. The red, blue, and gold-starred flag of the National Liberation Front fluttered in the wind. We marched from the dense forest to the plain, advancing towards the enemy's heart. "It's less than thirty kilometers to Saigon from here," a Southern comrade said, pointing in the direction ahead. Hearing this, a feeling of indescribable joy and comfort surged within us.
    Sometimes, along the road, we marched alongside Liberation Army soldiers in the same direction, carrying the big items captured during the rainy season victories—heavy recoilless rifles and mortars. The spoils of war captured in the southern Eastern Region battlefield those few times could truly be said to be piled up like mountains. In the Dong Xoai battle, even trucks were used to transport the spoils of war. "We have cars too!" How many people did I hear praising this at that time? For soldiers who rely on their shoulders and feet year after year, how deep is the feeling contained in this sentence! Interspersed in the marching队伍 were also civilian laborers supporting the front. It was simply an endless stream of people, men, women, old people… There was an old man with a small child on his back—later I learned that the old man insisted on participating in the support transport and brought his little grandson to carry grain for him, so he could carry more things himself; those young girls all had their trouser legs rolled up, wearing Liberation Army soft caps, with a strand of long black hair fluttering under the brim of the cap.
    The vigorous flow of people flowed in one direction: the front near Saigon. As I advanced with the队伍, I thought: Isn't this the most vivid picture of a great situation of troops besieging the city?
    Before we had time to listen to the introduction to the moving situation of the struggle in the suburbs of Saigon, at dawn on November 11th, urgent gunfire came from the south. "We started first, this battle is the best answer to the questions you raised," said the Southern comrade cheerfully.
    The battle on the 11th was fought on Highway 1, thirty-six kilometers from Saigon. The battle began at dawn. The Liberation Army first knocked out a forward哨 in Cu Chi District and then tightly surrounded the enemy's convoy on the highway. The enemy was anxious. American F-105 aircraft and the American-puppet military's 105mm artillery continuously bombed and shelled wildly in an attempt to break the siege. The terrain on both sides of this section of the highway is flat, without trees, and the concealment conditions are poor. American aircraft bombed in shifts, and the artillery bombarded intensively for thirty minutes, leaving the battlefield within a two-kilometer radius riddled with bomb craters, like a honeycomb. However, the Liberation Army's positions stood firm, and the soldiers' common determination was: "Not to retreat an inch!" After the American-puppet military's wild bombing, they thought that the "Viet Cong" would be finished this time. So, more than ten American amphibious armored vehicles and three连 of puppet troops, divided into two routes, crept in sneakily. However, the enemy's actions were already within the Liberation Army's expectations. Before the first M-113 armored vehicle approached, the Liberation Army soldiers suddenly appeared like divine soldiers. The first shell from a squad of artillerymen hit an armored vehicle. Soldier Chen Wenyong took off his shirt, which had been scorched by napalm bombs, picked up his gun, and followed the commander, chasing the enemy's tanks on the highway. Seeing that the situation was not good, the armored vehicles emitted a puff of white smoke from their rear and quickly fled.
    At this time, on the battlefield, the wreckage of American armored vehicles and trucks lay on the ground, and puppet soldiers were killed and wounded everywhere.
    Later, the enemy's cries were heard on the Liberation Army's walkie-talkie. The puppet infantry said to the American M-113: "You are wearing iron clothes, you go first, and we will follow you." "You go first, and we will protect you," the M-113 replied. "No way." "You go first."... The battle continued until 4:30 in the afternoon. Four armored vehicles, many trucks, and the corpses of nearly two hundred enemies lay in the rice paddies by the road. The fleeing and reinforcing enemies dared not enter the war zone again.
    I met Comrade Li Mingri, the commander who directed this battle. He hadn't slept well for seven days and seven nights. Excessive thinking and lack of sleep made his cheeks thin, but his eyes were bright and piercing. "Today, we are launching the first battle of the dry season at the gate of Saigon," Comrade Li Mingri said in a firm tone. "It has never happened before that we fought so hard in broad daylight on the highway. Isn't it very clear who is the master of the dry season? When our soldiers received the order to transfer, they wrote letters of determination, unwilling to leave their positions, saying, 'Let's take advantage of the good weather and fight another beautiful battle!'"
    On November 11th, the great victory in the battle on Highway 1 at the gate of Saigon gave the enemy a resounding slap in the face. At this time, a lament came out of Saigon: "The South Vietnam battlefield will always be the rainy season."
    Annihilating the American Aggressors
    On November 12th, there were an unusually large number of American planes flying over the village where we lived. The "old woman"-style reconnaissance planes that usually circled overhead all day were gone. In the early morning, bursts of bombing and shelling came from not far away. We looked at the map and found the direction, knowing that a big fight had broken out to our northwest.
    Sure enough, the good news came at noon that day: the Liberation Army had achieved brilliant results in encircling and annihilating the American army in the Bau Bang area. The Southern comrades and I clapped and cheered for this good news. People discussed one after another: "The American army has also tasted bitterness." "Now everyone can see that we can defeat the American aggressors."
    Last year, large batches of American troops climbed into the South Vietnam battlefield. They wore extremely light automatic weapons on their chests and were full of momentum. From the head of American imperialism to Western reporters, they all cheered them on, as if the American army's predicament on the South Vietnam battlefield could be immediately resolved as soon as the American army climbed up.
    In this way, a question was raised before the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces: Can they fight the American army? Can they win against the American army?
    Now, I will give a brief account of the introduction of a commander who commanded the Bau Bang battle about this battle.
    After the American aggressors landed on the coast of South Vietnam and temporarily stabilized, they poked their pig snouts into the interior, attempting to attack the liberated areas and encircle the main force of the Liberation Army. They transferred the "ace troops"—the American 1st Infantry Division, Airborne Division, Cavalry Division, etc.—into the mountainous and forest areas. In the battle in the Bau Bang area, the American army used two infantry battalions, two armored regiments, and a reinforced artillery company of the 1st Infantry Division, attempting to launch an attack on the D liberated area.
    At dawn on November 12th, when the American army was not yet awake, the powerful Liberation Army suddenly surrounded the American army and then divided into several routes to insert into the American army camp, immediately splitting the enemy's camp into several pieces. The encirclement and annihilation troops interspersed, divided, compressed at close range, and various artillery fires, grenades, explosive packages, and automatic weapons pressed towards the American army's positions together. Just a few minutes after the fighting started, the American army's communication lines were cut off by the Liberation Army. The Liberation Army soldiers shouted the slogan "Resolutely wipe out the American aggressors" and charged bravely, each like a little tiger. They didn't even look at the American planes flying close to the treetops. Some soldiers rushed to within ten meters of the American army and opened fire. Despite the smoke, the Liberation Army soldiers still fired very accurately. The Liberation Army artillery carried recoilless guns and interspersed in. Because the gun position was low-lying and there were rubber trees blocking the view, it was difficult to aim. "Come on!" Gunner Wu Shi jumped to a high ground and fired with the gun body supported on his shoulder.
    The offensive launched by the Liberation Army was so fierce that the American aggressors were completely frightened, crawling and rolling under the armored vehicles, firing their guns randomly. The American cannons drooped their heads and did not fire a single shot. Those tanks, armored vehicles, and trucks were paralyzed on the ground one by one.
    It was precisely such Liberation Army warriors who wiped out more than 2,000 troops of the American army's "Big Red One" division, which had been touted to the sky, in a three-hour battle. The American army leader in Saigon was so angry that he stomped his feet. Although the battlefield was very close to Saigon, they had no way to do anything, and finally sent more than 200 aircraft sorties to bomb the battlefield upside down in an attempt to destroy the evidence.
    The Bau Bang battle was the first heavy blow to the American aggressors on the southern battlefield. The valiant and skillful, agile Liberation Army proved with their actions that they can not only completely crush the evil "special warfare" launched by American imperialism, but also defeat the American aggressors who personally came out. The Bau Bang battle wrote the most glorious chapter of large-scale annihilation of American aggressors.
    Later, when we were interviewing in Di An-Xin An Province, we often heard the Liberation Army say such words: "We can't fall behind in fighting the American army, we must catch up head-on." "Put hatred on the muzzle of the gun and severely annihilate the American aggressors!" These words have become the common will and resolute action of the South Vietnam Liberation Army.
          Huge Spiritual Power
    I also remember the scene when I went to interview the front-line troops in the central Trung Khu area. The commander of a certain unit of the Liberation Army led me to climb a small hill. Before us was the vast and fertile coastal plain of Quang Nam Province. Thick black smoke rose above a village not far away. American F-100 fighter-bombers bombed and strafed the Liberation Army positions in shifts. The Liberation Army soldiers rushed towards the enemy's positions in the rain of bullets, chasing and beating the enemy hard.
    After the battle was won, the commander said to me, "Our troops were born in the flames of war and grew up in the flames of war. I can't help but brag about my troops to you. ... The enemy is always conceited and stupid. They don't understand our soldiers. Our soldiers are truly revolutionary hard bones."
    I completely understood and completely agreed with the commander's words.
    American imperialism always thinks that it can scare the South Vietnamese people by relying on its "sea and air superiority." The American aggressors have never seen that the South Vietnamese people have an absolute advantage in politics and ideology.
    Indeed, the Southern People's Armed Forces today do not yet have airplanes, cannons, or tanks; but it is also true that, regardless of the rainy season or the dry season, they defeated the American imperialists armed to the teeth with rice and light weapons.
    Let's start with a story about a Liberation Army soldier!
    Twenty-one-year-old Lai Wenning—called the Steel Warrior by the people—is a new soldier in a certain unit of the Liberation Army in the southern region. He is from Ping Xin County, Jia Dinh Province. He was a cowherd when he was young. After his hometown was liberated, he voluntarily joined the army in 1964. He was seriously injured after the Dong Xoai battle last July and was sent to the hospital, where he is still lying in bed. This is the third time he has been injured and admitted to the hospital. This time the injury was more serious, but like the previous two times, as soon as he was carried into the hospital, he thought about being discharged and participating in another battle.
      "Getting a little injury doesn't mean anything," he said cheerfully, pointing to the wounds on his head, hands, and feet to the reporter. "Look, this is from the Ping Ye battle, this is left over from attacking the Han Xin stronghold, this is a souvenir from the Dong Xoai battle." His body is simply a battle map.
    At the beginning of last year, Lai Wenning participated in the Ping Ye battle, which was the first major battle he had participated in since joining the army. American air bandits dropped bombs by the ton, and the puppet troops fired artillery and guns randomly. Lai Wenning was not afraid in the hail of bullets, rushed to the front, and beat the enemy fiercely. In the battle, although he was wounded in five places on his head, hands, feet, and chest, he insisted on not leaving the front line until the entire enemy was wiped out and the battle was over.
    Later, he was sent to the hospital for treatment.
    Lai Wenning was hospitalized for three weeks, and three wounds were healed. One day, a Liberation Army unit came to help the hospital dig air-raid shelters, which was the company Lai Wenning was in. Lai Wenning was unspeakably happy to see his comrades, asking about this and that. While the troops were digging fortifications, Lai Wenning secretly packed his backpack. After the troops finished digging the fortifications and returned to the team, Lai Wenning avoided the doctor, left the hospital, and followed his comrades from afar. Halfway, the comrades discovered him.
    "Did the doctor allow you to be discharged? Do you have a certificate?" the comrades asked in unison.
    Lai Wenning replied, "No."
    "How can that be?" the comrades shouted.
    "Why can't it be?" Lai Wenning became anxious: "I wanted to, but the doctor didn't give it to me. I've been in the hospital for so long, you guys are winning battles, I..."
    The comrades all understood him and did not continue to say anything. Everyone walked together. After walking for another two hours, Lai Wenning felt a little dizzy. He avoided his comrades and leaned lightly on the trunk of a tree for a while. He thought, I can't let my comrades know, otherwise the opportunity to wipe out the enemy that I have been thinking about day and night during my hospitalization will be gone. He straightened his chest and strode into the comrades' team again. This time he was discharged, he still had a piece of the enemy's shrapnel in his chest!
    Not long after being discharged from the hospital, he participated in the battle to attack the enemy's Han Xin stronghold. In this battle, all the defending enemies were wiped out. Lai Wenning was wounded again and sent to the hospital for the second time, where he was hospitalized for another two weeks. At this time, the troops were preparing to fight the Dong Xoai battle. Lai Wenning lay in bed thinking, how can I not participate in a big battle? But it's not okay to leave the hospital secretly again! So he thought of another way. He pestered the doctor every day: "I'm better, I can be discharged from the hospital." "The front is winning battles, I can't lie down all the time!" "Let me be discharged!"
    The doctor was finally moved by him: "Okay, let you go out, but you can't participate in strenuous activities."
    Lai Wenning happily stepped out of the hospital gate, putting the doctor's instructions behind him.
    After Lai Wenning returned to the team, he immediately threw himself into battle preparation. When the first battle was fought, the American planes bombed and shelled wildly, and the shock wave knocked him down several times. He touched his head, touched his legs, no injuries, so he rushed into the enemy's阵地. After the first battle was won, Lai Wenning participated in the battle to annihilate the enemy's 7th Parachute Battalion. The puppet military's 7th Parachute Battalion was considered an elite troop of the American puppet military, well-equipped, and personally commanded by the Americans. This battle was very fierce. For Lai Wenning, this battle was a severe test of his revolutionary spirit.
    The battle was launched during the day. As soon as they made contact, the Liberation Army immediately surrounded the 7th Parachute Battalion tightly. The American army dispatched F-100 fighter-bombers to assist, and twelve American planes bombed and strafed the positions in shifts like headless flies. The screeching howls of the jets diving, the explosions of the bombs, shook the trees around the positions. However, the Liberation Army's positions stood firm and gradually compressed the encirclement.
    Lai Wenning rushed into the enemy's stubbornly resisting fortifications with the班. The enemy was immediately in chaos, firing cannons randomly. The shells exploded one after another on both sides of Lai Wenning, the shrapnel cut off Lai Wenning's hair and injured his face and chest. The shock wave knocked him far away and fainted on the spot. When the comrades saw Lai Wenning fall, they shouted angrily: "Avenge Lai Wenning, comrades, charge!" Lai Wenning did not die. In his coma, he felt someone lift him up and take the automatic weapon from his chest. He wanted to reach out and stop it, but he didn't have the strength to move a finger. A few minutes passed, and the sound of bombs exploding nearby woke him up. He first reached out to touch the weapon in front of him, but it was gone, and his fingers were only stained with blood. He didn't care about his wounds, supported himself with both hands, lifted his body, a burst of piercing pain forced him to let go of his hands, and his body fell back down. Lai Wenning thought: Am I really not going to make it? The enemy's machine guns rang non-stop like popping beans. Lai Wenning immediately felt that the front line was tight and needed people! He once again supported himself with both hands, once, again, he finally got up, lifted his lead-heavy legs, and rushed forward bravely.
    "Squad leader, give me a gun," he said loudly, running to the squad leader.
    "Give you a gun? I'm going to send you back!" The squad leader stared painfully at Lai Wenning's wounds and blood.
    "No, didn't you say that minor injuries shouldn't leave the front line?" Lai Wenning retorted righteously.
    "You have minor injuries?!"
    "Annihilating the enemy is important, regardless of it."
    Lai Wenning stepped over the squad leader and rushed forward in one step. He took an American冲锋枪 from the dead enemy and picked up many bullets. He jumped into the enemy's fortifications, stepped on the corpses of the "ace troops," and swept a burst of bullets at the stubbornly resisting enemy. When the enemy retreated, Lai Wenning charged. The Liberation Army's encirclement was shrinking. At this time, the American flying thieves were even more crazy, throwing bombs directly at the places where the enemy and we were very close, trying to炸 out a bloody path so that the "ace troops" could escape. The soil lifted by the bombs covered the Liberation Army soldiers. Lai Wenning only felt a darkness in front of him in the shock wave, and fell to the ground again, fainting. At this time, the trapped enemy was making a desperate struggle. Guns and shells flew around Lai Wenning like raindrops. Lai Wenning opened his eyes slightly in a semi-conscious state, climbed up, and seeing the enemy in chaos, he didn't even raise his head, didn't look at the American planes spinning wildly, picked up his gun, and pulled the trigger with all his might, and five enemies fell in front of him. Lai Wenning kept firing the bullets until they were all gone. The shock wave of the bomb knocked him unconscious again and fell on the position. At this time, he was still holding the gun tightly in his hand. When Lai Wenning woke up, he had been transferred to the rear. As soon as he opened his eyes, he asked: "Has the 7th Battalion been eaten?" The satisfactory answer made him smile.
    Lai Wenning said lying in bed: "For the motherland, for the nation, we are never afraid of sacrifice. A little injury, it's nothing, as long as I have a breath, even if I hobble, I will drag and beat the American bandits. I just don't want my eyes to be injured, because I want to see with my own eyes the unification of the motherland, and see our beloved Uncle Ho."
    Lai Wenning is one of the thousands of South Vietnam Liberation Army soldiers. His spirit of decisive battle, heroic and tenacious spirit is also shared by all Liberation Army soldiers. From Lai Wenning, from thousands of Liberation Army soldiers, we have seen the South Vietnamese people's heroic and tenacious fighting will, and we have seen the great spirit of revolutionary heroism of the Southern people. They have given full play to the human factor, the power of the spirit, overcame all difficulties, and overwhelmed all enemies.

### 英雄的军队  钢铁的战士

    英雄的军队  钢铁的战士
    谁是旱季的主人
    森林里终日不停的暴雨不见了，风变得柔软暖和了；同塔梅的汪洋积水，一天天低下去，露出了新绿的阔叶草；湄公河三角洲，万里碧空，从早到晚，挂着个火热火热的太阳。
    雨季过去了，越南南方解放军战士在雨季频频出击，连连大捷之后，乘着战斗的间隙拆洗受潮的衣服，晒晒吊床，准备新的战斗。
    雨季过去了，敌人蠢蠢欲动，美国侵略者和它的西贡走狗每天张破喉咙哇哇乱叫：“越共的雨季过去了”，“我们的旱季到来了”，“发挥陆空优势，旱季改观战局”。这预示着严峻的战斗即将来临。
    去年，我们就在美伪集团一片“旱季攻势”的叫嚣声中，跨过了宽阔的西贡河，到西贡前线去。大白天，我们走在连结西贡的市郊公路上。运粮的大轱辘牛车代替了往常流线型小汽车。穿得花花绿绿的儿童，在村头满脸笑容挥手迎接解放军。民族解放阵线的红蓝金星旗迎风飘扬。我们从密林走向平原，向着敌人的心脏前进。“这里离西贡不到三十公里了。”南方同志指着前面方向说。我们听着，心里涌出一股说不出的愉快和舒坦。
    有时，顺着大路，我们同解放军战士并肩朝着一个方向前进。雨季大捷中缴获过来的大家伙——重型无后座力炮、迫击炮，也扛着前进。那几次在南部东区战场上缴获的战利品真可说是堆积如山。东帅战斗中还用了大卡车运输战利品。“我们也有汽车了！”那时我听到多少人这么赞扬。对于长年靠双肩背，靠双脚走的战士来说，这句话包含着多深的感情啊！夹在行进的队伍中前进的，也有支前民工，那简直是一条没有尽头的人流，男的、女的、老的……有个老人的背后还跟个小的——后来我才知道，那个老人坚决要来参加支前运输，把小孙子带来给他背粮食，自己好多背东西；那些年青的姑娘都挽着裤腿，头戴解放军软帽，帽沿下飘着一绺黑长发。
    朝气勃勃的人流，流向一个方向：西贡附近的前线。我随着队伍前进，心里想：这不是一幅最生动的兵临城下的大好形势图吗？
    我们还没有来得及听完动人心弦的西贡市郊斗争形势的介绍，十一月十一日凌晨，南面就传来了急迫的枪炮声。“我们先开始了，这场战斗正是你们提出的问题的最好回答。”南方同志乐呵呵地说。
    十一日的战斗是在离西贡三十六公里的一号公路上打的。战斗在清晨打响，解放军先敲掉了古芝县的一个前沿岗哨，又在公路上紧紧包围了敌人的车队。敌人急了，美军F—105型飞机和美伪军一○五口径大炮持续地狂炸和轰击，企图解围。这一带公路两侧，地势平，没有树，隐蔽条件差。美国飞机轮番地炸，大炮密集轰击三十分钟，弄得两公里范围的战区内，弹坑遍地，象蜂窝一样。然而，解放军阵地巍然屹立，战士的共同决心是：“寸步不退！”美伪军在狂轰滥炸之后，以为这下子“越共”可完蛋了。于是，十多辆美国两栖装甲车，三连伪军，分两路，贼头贼脑地摸进来。然而，敌人的行动早在解放军的预料之中。没等第一辆M—113型装甲车接近，解放军战士就如同一支神兵突然出现。一班炮手第一发炮弹就击中一辆装甲车。战士陈文勇脱去凝固汽油弹烧焦了的上衣，端起枪，跟着指挥员，在公路上追击敌人的战车。装甲车见势不妙，屁股冒了一股白烟，就飞快逃跑了。
    这时的战场上，美国的装甲车、卡车残骸瘫在地上，伪军死伤遍地。
    后来，在解放军的步谈机里传出了敌人的叫唤声。伪军步兵对美国M—113说：“你们是穿铁衣的，你们先上，我们跟着你们。”“你们先上，我们保卫你们。”M—113回答。“不行。”“你们先上。”……战斗一直打到下午四点半，四辆装甲车、许多卡车和近二百名敌人的尸体躺在路边稻田里。逃跑的、增援的敌人都不敢再进入战区。
    我见到指挥这次战斗的指挥员黎明日同志，他已经七天七夜没有睡好了。多思，缺睡，使他两颊削瘦，但目光炯炯有神。“今天我们在西贡大门口打响旱季第一仗。”黎明日同志用坚定的语调说：“这样大白天在公路上大打，过去是没有过的。谁是旱季的主人，不很清楚吗？我们的战士接到转移的命令时，写决心书，都不愿离开阵地，说‘趁好天，再打个漂亮仗吧！’”
    十一月十一日，西贡大门口一号公路上的战斗大捷，给了敌人一记响亮的耳光。这时西贡传出来哀叹：“南越战场将永远是雨季。”痛歼美国侵略军
    十一月十二日，我们住的村子上空飞过的美国飞机特别多。往常终日在头上转的“老太婆”式侦察机却不见了。清晨，不远处传来阵阵的炸弹声和炮击声。我们看地图，找方向，知道在我们的西北边大打起来了。
    果然，当天中午传来了捷报：解放军在保邦地区围歼美军战果辉煌。我和南方同志一起为这个喜讯拍手叫好。人们纷纷议论：“美军也尝到苦头了。”“现在谁都可以看到，我们能打败美国侵略军。”
    去年一年，美军大批大批爬进南越战场。他们胸前挂着极轻的自动武器，气势汹汹。从美帝国主义头子直到西方记者，一齐给他们鼓气，真好象美军一爬上来，美国侵略者在南越战场上的困境就能立刻解除似的。
    这样，在南越人民武装面前提出了一个问题：能不能打美军，能不能打赢美军呢？
    现在，我把指挥保邦战斗的一位指挥员关于这次战斗的介绍，作个简叙。
    美国侵略军在南越沿海登陆暂时稳定之后，他们就把猪嘴伸进内地，企图进攻解放区，围攻解放军主力。他们把“王牌军”——美军第一步兵师、空降师、骑兵师等等调进山区林区。在保邦地区战斗中，美军启用了第一步兵师的两个步兵营、两个装甲支团、一个加强炮兵连，企图对D解放区发动进攻。
    十一月十二日拂晓，当美军还未睡醒时，强大的解放军突然对美军进行包围，然后分几路向美军营地猛插，立刻把敌人的营地劈成几块。围歼部队穿插，分割，近战压缩，各种炮火、手榴弹、炸药包和自动武器，一齐向美军阵地上压去。刚打响几分钟，美军的联络线就被解放军切断了。解放军战士高呼着“坚决把美国侵略者消灭干净”的口号，勇猛冲杀，个个象小老虎。他们对贴着树梢飞的美国飞机连看都不看一眼。有的战士猛冲到距离美军不到十米处开枪射击。尽管硝烟弥漫，解放军战士照样射击得十分准确。解放军炮兵扛起无后座力炮穿插进来了。由于炮位地势低洼，眼前又有橡胶树挡住视线，不好瞄准。“来！”炮手武世跃到高地，把炮身架到自己肩膀上射击。
    解放军发动的攻势如此之猛，美国侵略军完全吓昏了，连爬带滚地躲进了装甲车底下，胡乱放枪。美军的大炮耷拉着脑袋，一炮未发。那些坦克、装甲车、卡车，一个个瘫痪在地上。　
    正是这样的解放军勇士，在三小时战斗中，把吹得天花乱坠的美军“大红一”师的两千多人马报销了。西贡的美军头目气得直跺脚。虽然战场距离西贡极近，但他们也毫无办法，最后竟派出两百多架次飞机，把战场炸翻了个个儿，图谋灭迹。
    保邦战斗是南部战场上对美国侵略军的第一次沉重打击。英勇善战、行动自如的解放军，用自己的行动证明：他们不仅能彻底粉碎美帝国主义发动的罪恶的“特种战争”，而且能够打败亲自出马的美国侵略军。保邦战斗写下了大规模痛歼美国侵略军的最光辉的篇章。
    后来，我们在堤岸—新安省采访时，经常听到解放军说这样的话：“打美军我们也不能落后，要迎头赶上。”“把仇恨放在枪口上，痛歼美国侵略者！”这些话已经成了越南南方解放军的共同意志和坚决行动了。
          巨大的精神力量
    我还记得在中部中区有一次到前线部队去采访的情景。解放军某部指挥员领我登上一座小山岗。眼前是广阔肥沃的广南省沿海平原。不远的村落上空升起浓黑的烟柱。美军F—100型战斗轰炸机，轮番在解放军阵地上轰炸扫射。解放军战士在弹雨中向敌人阵地扑去，追着敌人猛揍。
    战斗胜利结束后，指挥员对我说：“我们的部队是在战火中诞生，在战火中成长的，对你，我也禁不住要夸夸自己的部队。……敌人总是自负的，愚蠢的，他们不了解我们的战士，我们的战士真正是革命的硬骨头。”
    我完全理解，而且完全赞同指挥员的话。
    美帝国主义总以为靠着自己的“海空优势”，就能吓倒越南南方人民。美国侵略者从来也看不到越南南方人民在政治上和思想上是居绝对优势的。
    的确，今天的南方人民武装手里还没有飞机、大炮、坦克；但也的的确确，他们不论雨季，也不论旱季，用大米加轻武器打败了武装到牙齿的美帝国主义。
    让我们先讲个解放军战士的故事吧！
    二十一岁的赖文宁——人们称他为钢铁战士，是南部地区解放军某部的一个新战士。他是嘉定省平新县人，从小当放牛娃，家乡解放后，一九六四年自愿参军入伍。去年七月东帅战役之后，他负了重伤被送进医院，现在还躺在病床上。这是他第三次负伤进院了。这次伤势较重，可是象前两次一样，他刚被抬进医院，就想着出院，想着参加另一次战斗。
      “受点伤，算不了什么，”他乐呵呵地指着头上、手上、脚上的伤口对记者说：“你看，这是平也战斗的，这是攻打寒信据点留下的，这是东帅战斗的纪念。”他身上简直是一幅战斗地图。
    去年年初，赖文宁参加了平也战斗，这是他入伍以来参加第一次大战斗。美国空中强盗成吨成吨地扔炸弹，伪军胡乱打炮开枪。赖文宁在枪林弹雨中毫不畏惧，冲在头里，猛打敌人。战斗中，他的头上、手上、脚上、胸前虽然受伤五处，但是坚持不下火线，直到全歼敌人，战斗结束。
    后来，他被送进医院治疗。
    赖文宁住院三星期，三处伤口治愈了。一天，一支解放军部队开来帮医院挖防空工事，这正是赖文宁所在的连队。赖文宁见到自己的同志，问长问短，说不出的高兴。部队在挖工事，赖文宁却偷偷地收拾自己的背包，部队挖完工事返队，赖文宁避过医生，离开医院，远远尾随着自己的同志走了。半路上，同志们发现了他。
    “医生准你出院了？有证书吗？”同志们同声问他。
    赖文宁回答说：“没有。”
    “哪行？”同志们嚷开了。
    “那怎么不行，”赖文宁急了：“我要，医生不给，我住院这么久，你们打胜仗，我……”
    同志们都了解他，没有继续往下说，大家一起走了。又走了两小时，赖文宁觉得有点头晕，他躲开了同志们，轻轻在树干上靠了一会儿。他想，不能被同志们知道，要不自己在住院期间日思夜盼的歼敌机会也就完了。他又挺起胸大步奔进同志们的队伍。这次出院，他的胸部还有一块敌人的弹片呢！
    出院不久，他又参加了攻打敌人寒信据点的战斗。这次战斗，全歼了守敌。赖文宁又受了伤，第二次被送进医院，又住院两星期。这时部队正在准备打东帅战斗。赖文宁躺在病床上想，打大仗，自己不参加哪行？可是再次偷着离院也不行啊！于是他另想法儿。他天天找医生磨蹭：“我好了啊，可以出院了。”“前方打胜仗，我不能老躺着啊！”“让我出院吧！”
    医生终于被他说动了：“好，让你出去，可不能参加激烈活动。”
    赖文宁高兴地跨出院门，把医生的嘱咐搁到脑后去了。
    赖文宁归队之后立刻投入了战斗准备。打第一仗时，美国飞机狂轰滥炸，气浪把他摔了好几个跟斗。他摸摸脑袋，摸摸腿，没伤，就冲进敌阵去了。第一仗胜利结束，接着赖文宁又参加歼敌伞兵第七营的战斗。伪军伞兵第七营算是美伪的精锐部队，装备好，又有美国佬亲自指挥。这一仗打得很激烈，对赖文宁来说这场战斗是对他的革命精神的一场严峻考验。
    战斗是在白天打响的，一接触，解放军立刻把伞兵七营紧紧围困住了。美军出动了F—100型战斗轰炸机助战，十二架美国飞机象摘了头的苍蝇一样，在阵地上空轮番轰炸扫射，喷气机俯冲时发出尖啸怪叫声，炸弹的爆炸声，把阵地四周的树木震得颤抖。可是，解放军阵地巍然屹立，并且步步压缩包围圈。
    赖文宁随班冲进了敌人顽抗的工事里，敌人顿时慌作一团，胡乱打炮。炮弹在赖文宁两侧接连爆炸，弹片削掉了赖文宁的头发，打伤了他的脸部、胸部，气浪把他摔得老远，当场昏过去了。同志们见赖文宁倒下，愤怒地高喊：“为赖文宁报仇，同志们冲啊！”赖文宁没有死，在昏迷中，他觉得有人扶起他，又从他胸前取下了自动武器。他想伸手拦住，可是他没有力气动弹一个指头。几分钟过去了，附近炸弹的爆炸声把他震醒过来。他先伸手摸身前的武器没有了，手指上只是斑斑血迹。他没有管自己的伤口，用两手支撑，抬了抬身子，一阵钻心的伤痛，强使他松开手，身子又躺了下来。赖文宁想：自己真的不行了吗？敌人的机枪象爆豆一般嗒嗒嗒连响不停。赖文宁立刻觉得前沿吃紧，正需要人啊！他又一次双手撑起身子，一次，再次，他终于爬了起来，抬起铅一般重的双腿，勇猛地冲上前去。
    “班长，给我枪。”他奔到班长面前大声说。
    “给你枪？要把你送回去！”班长沉痛地注视着赖文宁满身伤口血迹。
    “不，你不是说过轻伤不下火线吗？”赖文宁理直气壮地反驳。
    “你伤轻？！”
    “歼敌要紧，不管它。”
    赖文宁越过班长，一个箭步冲向前去。他从倒毙的敌人身上取了一支美式冲锋枪，又拣了许多子弹，跳进敌人的工事，踩着“王牌军”的尸体，向负隅顽抗的敌人横扫了一梭子子弹。敌人退，赖文宁就冲。解放军的包围圈在缩小。这时美国飞贼更疯狂，直往敌我相距极近的地方扔炸弹，企图炸出一条血路，好让“王牌军”逃命。炸弹掀起的土把解放军战士盖住了，赖文宁在气浪中只觉得眼前一片昏黑，又应声倒地，昏了过去。这时，被困的敌人正在作垂死挣扎，枪弹炮弹象雨点一般嗖嗖地向赖文宁四周飞来。赖文宁在半醒半昏中微微睁开眼，爬起身，眼见敌人乱作一团，他连头也不抬，根本不看疯狂打转的美国飞机，拿起枪，使尽全力扣动扳机，五个敌人在他面前倒下了。赖文宁一直把子弹打光，炸弹气浪再次把他打昏过去，倒在阵地上，这时，他依然紧握着手中枪。待赖文宁醒来，他已被转送到后方了，他一睁眼就问：“七营吃掉了没有？”满意的回答使他微笑了。
    赖文宁躺在病床上说：“为祖国，为民族，我们从不怕牺牲。伤点儿，没啥，我只要有口气，就是拐着腿，也要揪打美国强盗。我只不想让两眼受伤，因为我要亲眼看到祖国统一，看到我们敬爱的胡伯伯。”
    赖文宁是成千上万越南南方解放军战士中的一个，他的决战决胜、英勇顽强的精神，也是全体解放军战士共有的。从赖文宁身上，从千万解放军战士身上，我们看到了越南南方人民英勇顽强的战斗意志，看到了南方人民革命英雄主义的伟大精神。他们充分发挥了人的因素，精神的力量，战胜了一切困难，压倒了一切敌人。
