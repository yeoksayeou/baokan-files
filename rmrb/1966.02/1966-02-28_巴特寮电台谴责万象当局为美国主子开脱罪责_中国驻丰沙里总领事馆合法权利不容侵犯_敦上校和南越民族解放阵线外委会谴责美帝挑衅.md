　　Pathet Lao Radio Condemns Vientiane Authorities for Exonerating American Masters
　　Legitimate Rights of Chinese Consulate General in Phongsaly Inviolable
　　Colonel Done and NFLSV Foreign Affairs Committee Condemn US Imperialist Provocations
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, February 26th: Pathet Lao Radio published a commentary on the 25th, pointing out that the purpose of the Lao Vientiane regime's denial on the 21st of the existence of the Chinese Consulate General in Phongsaly is to cover up the crime of its American masters deliberately attacking the Chinese Consulate General in Phongsaly.
    The commentary said that, as everyone knows, the Chinese Consulate General in Phongsaly is a legitimate institution that has been recognized by the Lao tripartite national unity government and is still recognized now, and it possesses rights that no one can violate.
    The commentary pointed out that no matter how the US imperialists and the Vientiane authorities try to justify and cover up, they cannot escape their responsibility for using American aircraft to bomb and strafe Phongsaly city and the Chinese Consulate General stationed there. The Lao people express great anger at this crime of US imperialism and its lackeys.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, February 26th: According to the "Voice of Laos" radio broadcast on the 25th: Colonel Done, Commander of the Lao Patriotic Neutralist Forces, issued a statement on the 23rd, strongly condemning the provocative action of US imperialism in sending aircraft to attack the Chinese Consulate General in Phongsaly. The statement pointed out that this barbaric action by US imperialism and the Lao reactionaries is an attempt to undermine the long-standing relationship between the Lao people and the Chinese people, and extremely rudely tramples on international law; it is a new step in the blatant provocation against the 650 million Chinese people; and it is part of the US imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war of aggression.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Front for Liberation sent a telegram to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd, expressing great indignation at the incident of American aircraft attacking the Chinese Consulate General in Phongsaly, Laos. The telegram strongly condemned the provocative actions of US imperialism and expressed full support for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement on February 19th.

　　中国驻丰沙里总领事馆合法权利不容侵犯
　　敦上校和南越民族解放阵线外委会谴责美帝挑衅
    据新华社康开二十六日电　巴特寮电台二十五日发表评论指出，老挝万象政权二十一日否认中国驻丰沙里总领事馆的存在的目的，是为了掩盖它的美国主子蓄意袭击中国驻丰沙里总领事馆的罪行。
    评论说，众所周知，中国驻丰沙里总领事馆是老挝三方面民族团结政府历来承认并且现在也仍然承认的合法机构，它拥有任何人不可侵犯的权利。
    评论指出，任凭美帝国主义和万象当局如何辩解和包庇，也逃避不了它们使用美国飞机轰炸、扫射丰沙里市和驻在该市的中国总领事馆的责任。老挝人民对美帝国主义及其走狗的这一罪行表示极大的愤怒。
    据新华社康开二十六日电　据“老挝之声”电台二十五日广播：老挝爱国中立力量总指挥敦上校二十三日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义派遣飞机袭击中国驻丰沙里总领事馆的挑衅行动。声明指出，美帝国主义同老挝反动派的这一野蛮行动，是企图破坏老挝人民同中国人民之间的悠久关系，极端粗暴地践踏了国际法；是明目张胆地对六亿五千万中国人民进行挑衅的一个新步骤；是美帝国主义妄图扩大侵略战争的阴谋的一部分。
    新华社二十四日讯　越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会二十二日打电报给中国外交部，对美国飞机袭击中国驻老挝丰沙里总领事馆的事件表示极大愤慨。电报强烈谴责美帝国主义的挑衅行动，并且表示完全支持中国外交部二月十九日的声明。
