    Revolutionary Spirit Passed Down Through Generations
    Li Liucheng
    My home is in the Chengguan Commune of Lankao County. In the past, it suffered from years of natural disasters, and the people's lives could not be improved for many years. When I visited home last year, the situation had changed drastically. There were rows of trees everywhere; sandy and alkaline land had been transformed into fertile fields; rivers and canals crisscrossed, and agricultural and sideline production increased. The entire team sold tens of thousands of catties of surplus grain for the first time. The commune members were overjoyed and said: This is all thanks to Comrade Jiao Yulu. If he hadn't been fearless of heaven and earth and led us on the path of self-reliance and hard work, how could we have today!
    Comrade Jiao Yulu has passed away, but his spirit has taken root and sprouted in the hearts of the people of Lankao. When I returned home for the New Year last year, the district party secretary came. He asked if my family had white flour to eat and if there were any difficulties in life. He encouraged me to do a good job in the revolution in the army, to practice hard to kill the enemy, and to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao. My family all said: Although Old Jiao is gone, his work style has been left behind.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu truly "dedicated himself to the people until his last breath" in order to change the face of our Lankao County. As a soldier from Lankao, I will always cherish his memory and always learn from him. Now the whole country is learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, and I must study even harder. I must be like Comrade Jiao Yulu, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and always be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

    革命精神代代传
    李留成
    我家在兰考县城关公社，那里过去连年灾荒，人民生活多年翻不了身。去年我探家时，情形可大变了，到处是一行行树木；沙地、碱地变成了良田；沟河纵横，农副业增产，全队破天荒地卖了几万斤余粮。社员欢天喜地，他们说：这全是焦裕禄同志给咱带来的，要不是他不怕天不怕地，带领咱走奋发图强大道，咋会有今天！
    焦裕禄同志去世了，但是他的精神却已在兰考人民心中生根发芽。去年过年时我回到家里，区委书记来了。他问我们家有没有白面吃，生活有没有困难。勉励我在部队好好干革命，苦练杀敌本领，作毛主席的好战士。家里的人都说：老焦书记虽然不在了，他的作风可留下来啦。
    焦裕禄同志为了改变我们兰考县的面貌，真是“鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”。作为从兰考来的战士，我永远怀念他，要永远学习他。现在全国都在学焦裕禄同志，我更要好好学习，一定要象焦裕禄同志那样，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，永作毛主席的好战士。
