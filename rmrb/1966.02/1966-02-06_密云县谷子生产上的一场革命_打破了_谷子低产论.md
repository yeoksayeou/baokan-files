    A Revolution in Millet Production in Miyun County
    Breaking the "Low Millet Yield" Theory
    (Xinhua News Agency, 4th) The Miyun County Party Committee led the masses in a revolution in millet production, breaking the "low millet yield" theory and creating a new record of high millet yields over large areas. In 1965, the county planted more than 70,000 mu of millet, with an average yield of 451 jin per mu, doubling the yield of 1961. Many brigades achieved average millet yields of 600 jin, 800 jin, or even more than 900 jin per mu.
    Miyun is mostly mountainous, with about two-thirds of the county's cultivated land consisting of terraced fields on slopes, with thin and barren soil and spring droughts. The masses have always been accustomed to planting millet on these lands. In 1958, due to the construction of the Miyun Reservoir, the county's cultivated land in the plains areas was reduced, turning it from a surplus grain county into a grain-deficient county. The Miyun County Party Committee set an ambitious goal: to strive for high yields of grain crops with a large population and limited land, so that Miyun could transform from a grain-deficient county back into a surplus grain county. Thus, how to treat millet production became a prominent issue.
    At that time, the millet planting area in Miyun accounted for nearly one-third of the county's grain crop planting area, but the millet yield was very low. How to solve the problem of high yield in this nearly one-third of the cultivated land? Some leading cadres in the county adopted simple methods. They did not study the reasons for the backwardness of millet production, neglected the planting habits and living needs of the masses, and believed that since millet was a low-yield crop, its planting area should be reduced and replaced with corn, sweet potatoes, and other high-yield crops. By 1961, the millet planting area had decreased from more than 80,000 mu to more than 30,000 mu. Unexpectedly, things did not go as planned. After changing to corn and sweet potatoes on many barren slopes, the yield was lower than that of millet. Because less millet was planted, there was less millet bran, which affected pig farming; there was less millet straw, and the fodder for large livestock was insufficient; there was less millet, and it became difficult to adjust the variety of food grains. The masses were very unhappy about not being able to eat millet for a long time and criticized the reduction of the millet planting area.
    The criticism from the masses prompted the Miyun County Party Committee to seriously address the issue of millet production. Some leading cadres of the county studied Chairman Mao's "Serve the People," "On Contradiction," and "On Practice" with this issue in mind. They realized that millet production was a major issue related to the vital interests of the masses; the attitude towards it was a measure of whether the County Party Committee was thoroughly serving the people. In the past, the low yield of millet was caused under certain conditions; and the conditions could be changed by people's subjective initiative. Once the conditions changed, low yield could become high yield. Because millet was in a state of low yield, its potential for increased production was great. The key to high millet yield lay in the leadership of the County Party Committee. If the County Party Committee attached importance to millet production, put in hard work to lead the masses to create conditions for high millet yield, the production outlook of millet would greatly improve. After raising their ideological understanding, the County Party Committee made up its mind to launch a revolution in millet production. The goal of this revolution was to remove the "low-yield crop" label from millet, and at the same time improve the County Party Committee's methods and style of leadership in agricultural production.
    Accepting the lessons of past blind compression of the millet planting area, the Miyun County leading organs did not use administrative orders to restore the millet planting area within a limited time, nor did they put forward a set of opinions on increasing millet production. Leading cadres of the County Party Committee took the lead in going to production teams to stay and learn from the masses to find solutions to problems. After investigation and research, they learned that the low yield of millet in the past had many reasons. In addition to the barren millet land, the planting technology was also very backward. Most of the communes and teams used the old methods passed down for thousands of years to plant millet: large ridges with sparse seedlings, little or no fertilizer, no selection of improved varieties, and no prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. More importantly, people's thinking was conservative, and they were bound by the old framework of "millet is a low-yield crop," and did not believe that millet could achieve high yields. Therefore, they were unwilling to put effort into basic construction of millet land, unwilling to break with conventions, reform cultivation techniques, and carefully cultivate millet. This "low millet yield" theory, which was formed under the backward production conditions of the old society, was the main obstacle to the development of millet production.
    After finding the crux of millet production, the leading cadres of the Miyun County Party Committee, together with commune and team cadres and technicians, summarized the local masses' experience in planting high-yield millet, and together with the commune members planted high-yield millet experimental fields, and finally summarized a set of methods for increasing millet production. These methods are: (1) Rationally arrange the millet sowing period according to rainfall patterns and land conditions. (2) Implement rational close planting. (3) Increase the application of base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer in a timely manner. (4) Select improved varieties. (5) Improve the soil.
    How to break the "low millet yield" theory? The Miyun County Party Committee realized that in promoting measures to increase millet production, the first thing to do was to do a good job in ideological work, use demonstration methods to educate and guide the masses, and change some people's old ideas and habitual forces. In the past few years, the county has established 18 millet planting demonstration bases. Last year, seven communes planted high-yield millet fields, covering a total area of 30,000 mu. When the Dongtiangezhuang Grape Garden Brigade promoted new methods of planting millet, many people expressed doubts. Some said: Millet has always yielded 200 or 300 jin, which is not considered low, can it be increased further? Some people were even more resistant to rational close planting of millet. The Party branch discovered these problems and patiently persuaded them, and at the same time conducted experiments with triangular seedling retention and single-line seedling retention. After the autumn harvest, the triangular seedling retention millet yielded an average of 627 jin per mu, while the single-line seedling retention millet yielded only 450 jin per mu. Seeing this fact, the thinking of many people was cleared.
    The Miyun County Party Committee believes that although Miyun County has broken the "low millet yield" theory, the millet yield in some areas is still relatively low. The millet production revolution in Miyun County must continue. This year, the county plans to start from eliminating low-yield millet fields and increasing the multiple cropping index, and strive for millet production to reach a new level.

### 密云县谷子生产上的一场革命  打破了“谷子低产论”

    密云县谷子生产上的一场革命
    打破了“谷子低产论”
    据新华社四日讯　中共密云县委领导群众在谷子生产上进行了一场革命，打破“谷子低产论”，创造了谷子大面积高产的新纪录。一九六五年，这个县种植七万多亩谷子，平均亩产四百五十一斤，比一九六一年翻了一番；许多大队的谷子平均亩产六百斤、八百斤甚至九百多斤。
    密云多山，全县耕地约有三分之二是梯田坡地，土质瘠薄，春季干旱。群众向来就习惯在这些地上种谷子。一九五八年，由于修建密云水库，这个县平原地区的耕地减少了一些，由余粮县变成了缺粮县。中共密云县委立下雄心壮志：在人多地少情况下，争取粮食作物高产，使密云由缺粮县再变成余粮县。这样，如何对待谷子生产，就成了一个突出的问题。
    当时，密云的谷子播种面积占全县粮食作物种植面积近三分之一，但是谷子产量很低。如何解决这近三分之一耕地的高产问题呢？县里有些领导干部采取了简单的作法。他们没有研究谷子生产落后的原因，忽视了群众的种植习惯和生活需要，认为谷子既然是低产作物，那就缩小它的种植面积，改种玉米、甘薯及其它高产作物。到一九六一年，谷子种植面积便由原来的八万多亩减少到三万多亩。不想，事与愿违，许多瘠薄的坡地改种玉米、甘薯后，产量反而比谷子低。因为少种了谷子，谷糠少了，影响喂猪；谷草少了，大牲畜饲料不足；小米少了，食粮品种调剂也发生了困难，群众长期吃不上小米很有意见，对压缩谷子种植面积纷纷提出批评。
    群众的批评，促使中共密云县委认真对待谷子生产问题。县委的一些领导干部带着这个问题学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》、《矛盾论》和《实践论》。他们认识到，谷子生产是一个关系群众切身利益的大问题；以什么样的态度对待它，是衡量县委为人民服务彻底不彻底的一个标准。过去谷子低产，是在一定的条件下造成的；而条件是可以凭人的主观能动作用去改变的，条件变了，低产就可能变成高产。正因为谷子处在低产状态，它的增产潜力就很大。要谷子高产，关键在于县委领导。如果县委重视谷子生产，下苦功夫领导群众为谷子高产创造条件，谷子的生产面貌就会大为改观。县委在提高了思想认识以后，便下定决心，要发动群众在谷子生产上进行一场革命。这场革命的目标是给谷子摘掉“低产作物”帽子，同时改进县委领导农业生产的方法和作风。
    接受过去盲目压缩谷子种植面积的经验教训，密云县领导机关没有用行政命令的办法，限期恢复谷子种植面积，对谷子增产也没有提出一套意见。县委领导干部带头到生产队去蹲点，向群众请教解决问题的办法。经过调查研究，他们才了解到，过去谷子低产，原因很多，除了谷子地瘠薄以外，种植技术也很落后，大多数社队种谷子沿用千百年前传下来的老方法：大垄稀苗，少施肥或不施肥，不选用优良品种，不防治病虫害。而更为重要的是人们思想保守，被“谷子是低产作物”的老框框束缚住了，不相信谷子能够高产。因此，不肯在谷子地基本建设上下功夫，不愿破除陈规，改革耕作技术，精心伺弄谷子。这种在旧社会落后的生产条件下形成的“谷子低产论”，是发展谷子生产的主要障碍。
    找到了谷子生产的症结以后，密云县委领导干部又和社队干部、技术人员一起，总结当地群众种谷高产经验，和社员一起种谷子高产试验田，最后总结出一套谷子增产的办法。这套办法是：（一）根据降雨规律和土地条件，合理安排谷子播种期。（二）实行合理密植。（三）增施底肥，适时追肥。（四）选用优良品种。（五）改良土壤。
    怎样打破“谷子低产论”？中共密云县委认识到，在推广谷子增产措施中，首先要做好人的思想工作，运用示范的办法教育和引导群众，来改变一些人的旧思想和习惯势力。几年来，这个县先后建立了十八个谷子种植示范基点。去年，有七个公社种了谷子丰产田，面积共有三万亩。东田各庄葡萄园大队推行种谷新作法时，许多人表示怀疑。有的说：历来谷子打二三百斤就不算少，还能再多吗？有些人对谷子合理密植抵触更大。党支部发现这些问题，耐心地说服他们，同时进行了三角留苗和单线留苗的试验。秋后，三角留苗的谷子，平均亩产六百二十七斤，单线留苗的亩产量只有四百五十斤。看到了这个事实，不少人的思想才通了。
    中共密云县委认为，密云县虽然打破了“谷子低产论”，但是有些地方谷子的产量还比较低。密云县的谷子生产革命还要继续进行下去。今年这个县准备从消灭谷子低产田和提高复种指数等方面着手，力争谷子生产更上一层楼。
