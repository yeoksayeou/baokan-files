“Genuine Knowledge Comes from Those Who Practice in the World”
——Some Understandings and Experiences in Flower Alkaline Soil Improvement Work
Zhao Shouren, Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

The First Lesson the Masses Taught Us
In the Huaibei Plain area of Jiangsu Province, there is a type of low-yielding soil with saline-alkali properties. Historically affected by the Yellow River floods, this soil developed on these alluvial deposits, interspersed with good land, containing salt and alkali components, with complex salinization types. Based on its properties, the masses call it "tile alkali," "surface alkali," "halogen alkali," etc. Because its distribution is patchy and its salinization properties are complex, capable of sweeping salt and extracting nitrate, as well as boiling salt to obtain brine, the masses collectively call it "flower alkali soil." Initially, I mechanically applied so-called "genetic soil classification," considering it neither saline soil nor alkali soil, categorizing it as meadow soil and giving it a foreign name: "Salinized light-colored alluvial meadow soil developed on calcareous Yellow River alluvium." It was cumbersome to say and awkward to hear. In particular, crops planted in this soil suffered from severe seedling deficiencies due to salt return and alkali emergence, and even those that sprouted did not grow well. Clearly, it was a problem of salt and alkali, but we insisted on calling it meadow soil, which was also not practical. In 1958, during an investigation of cotton seedling deficiencies, we surveyed seventy-seven typical fields and found that many fields with no seedlings or dead seedlings did not have high salt content, but were mainly highly alkaline. Although this soil did not possess the typical characteristics of alkali soil as described in textbooks, we did not recognize it as alkali soil at that time. However, the masses, through years of production practice, deeply understood the harmfulness of "alkali" and clearly called it "alkali soil." The masses were completely justified in calling it that. We felt that the name "flower alkali soil" more vividly reflected the productive performance and characteristics of this type of salinized soil than meadow soil. Therefore, despite criticism from some comrades, we resolutely adopted the very scientific term "flower alkali soil." This was the first lesson the masses taught us in the process of contacting and understanding flower alkali soil. We deeply felt that, indeed, as Chairman Mao taught us: "Genuine knowledge comes from those who practice in the world." This fact also illustrates the depth of the influence of foreign frameworks and old concepts on us.

The Masses' Production Practice Experience is a Rich Treasure of Scientific Research
To transform flower alkali soil, we must first correctly understand it, know ourselves and know our enemy, and then we can win every battle. But how flower alkali soil was formed, why it is distributed patchily, what the future trend of salinization is, and a series of other questions, initially, we could say we understood nothing at all. To solve this problem, should we rely on the masses or rely on books, should we go deep into reality and start with investigation and research, or should we delve into old papers and check data, starting with closed-door experiments? This is a question of work method, and also a question of ideological method. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: "The viewpoint of practice is the first and fundamental viewpoint of dialectical-materialist epistemology." In previous years, we violated Chairman Mao's teaching and, instead of putting down the airs of intellectuals and asking the masses who had been dealing with flower alkali soil for generations for advice, we still flipped through books and looked for "foreign crutches." At that time, we tried every means to find a so-called authoritative foreign work on the genesis and evolution of salinized soil, treating it as a treasure, studying it day and night. As a result, apart from obtaining some ambiguous concepts that confused our minds even more, we did not gain any inspiration or enlightenment. It was not until 1959, during our stay in Suining County, that we happened to hear a few old farmers talking about "thin cows grow scabs, thin land becomes alkaline," "more manure can suppress alkali," which inspired us to think about whether the salt-alkali dynamics of the soil are closely related to fertility changes. This was the first time we introduced the concept of "fertility" in the study of the factors affecting the formation of flower alkali soil. Based on this clue, we also found that the groundwater under the salt-alkali patches in the field often had higher salt content than the surrounding good land. Combining this with the study of "On Contradiction," we realized: "The fundamental cause of the development of a thing is not external but internal; it lies in the contradictoriness within the thing." We further thought that soil fertility and the moisture balance of the cultivated layer might be closely related to salinization. In the moisture balance of the cultivated layer, evaporation and infiltration play a decisive role; and these two actions themselves are a unity of opposites. Evaporation greater than infiltration will lead to salinization of the soil; conversely, evaporation less than infiltration will lead to desalinization of the soil. Analyzing the various factors affecting the moisture balance of the cultivated layer, the properties of the cultivated layer itself, especially fertility, is the internal cause, and others are external causes. External causes play a role through internal causes, that is, through changes in fertility, affecting the moisture balance of the cultivated layer, causing the soil to desalinize or salinize. These ideas were further verified in the special investigation of the expanded problem of flower alkali soil conducted in 1962, and in the summary of the masses' experience in improving black soil. Based on these concepts, we made some inferences about the occurrence of flower alkali soil, such as "soil fertility is the main factor affecting the water balance of the cultivated layer," and "the formation of flower alkali soil is the result of salt-alkali accumulation, redistribution, and transformation caused by different infiltration and evaporation conditions in the cultivated layer," highlighting the role and position of fertilization in the improvement of flower alkali soil. It embodies the subjective dynamic role of people in the process of transforming the objective world, and supplements and develops the existing arguments for improving saline-alkali soil, providing a certain theoretical basis for better formulating flower alkali soil improvement measures in the future. At the same time, it also made us begin to realize that the experience of the broad masses is a rich treasure of science and wisdom. The role of scientists, to a large extent, is only to concentrate the experience of the masses, and elevate it to theory through processing; without believing in the masses, without relying on the masses, nothing can be accomplished.

Scientific Research Should be Combined with Current Production Practice
Researching flower alkali soil is for the purpose of improving flower alkali soil, but what path should be taken in researching flower alkali soil, should we first study the laws and then study the measures, or should we study the laws in combination with the measures? The essence of the question is "discipline with task" or "task with discipline." This issue was resolved very late in our ideological understanding. We once wanted to shut ourselves in and engage in so-called theoretical topics such as soil "salt balance," "water-salt dynamics," and "alkaline conversion mechanisms." We had great interest in things that happened hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of years ago, believing that if we did not trace back to ancient times and talk about ancient geography, ancient landforms, water chemistry, and salt chemistry, it would not be enough to demonstrate a high level of science when discussing the occurrence and improvement of saline-alkali soil. Conversely, we had little interest in the problems existing in current production. At that time, we mistakenly believed that only by understanding these things clearly could we prescribe the right medicine and propose measures. As a result, we spent a lot of time and energy without achieving anything significant, especially failing to align with the needs of local production, making the work difficult, hitting walls everywhere, and causing ourselves great distress. On the other hand, in some small topics that were more relevant to production needs, we opened up the situation in flower alkali soil improvement research, such as studying the problem of cotton seedling protection and recognizing the characteristic of flower alkali soil that salt content is high below and light above. Researching the cultivation measures of flower alkali soil, we recognized the salt dynamics law of flower alkali soil that "the land is like a sieve in July and August, and climbs up again in September and October." Promoting sesbania, from dozens of acres to millions of acres, we initially summarized the experience of large-scale sesbania cultivation and utilization and seedling protection. From the large-scale application of the "phosphorus to increase nitrogen" method, we initially recognized the role of phosphorus in increasing the yield of green manure such as sesbania and hairy vetch on flower alkali soil, and the effective application conditions, and so on. These have greatly enriched the content of flower alkali soil improvement research, aligned with local production, and were welcomed by farmers. This vivid fact has given us a deeper understanding of what Chairman Mao taught us: "If you want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality." "Knowledge apart from practice is impossible." Only by combining measures with the study of laws, combining the practice of saline-alkali soil improvement with the study of saline-alkali soil improvement, can we truly understand saline-alkali soil and make the saline-alkali soil improvement discipline vigorous and continuously develop forward. The practice of simply doing science for the sake of science will only turn the discipline into "water without a source, wood without roots," turning it into dry dogma.

Testing and Developing Theory Through Practice
Regarding the improvement of flower alkali soil, in the process of constantly hitting snags, we have finally gained some preliminary understanding, and have also put forward some preliminary views on how to improve it. These views are: drainage is an important way to improve, fertilization is the fundamental measure to improve, emphasizing integrated management of water and fertilizer, advocating shallow drainage, combined with rainwater drainage, flood control and waterlogging prevention, and salt drainage, and strengthening cultivation to control salt return, and so on. We have verified these arguments in the large-scale production practice of the Flower Alkali Soil Improvement Experimental Station in Tongshan County. Through the integrated management of agriculture and water, such as ditching, planting green manure, deep plowing, and loosening the soil, most of the land that could not grow crops before has begun to grow crops, and the soil quality has significantly improved. In 1964 and 1965, the summer-harvested three wheat and other crops all yielded multiples more than the neighboring production teams. This achievement strengthened our confidence in our work, and also made us realize the one-sidedness in our ideological methods. In the past, we believed that the formation of saline-alkali soil was related to certain hydrogeological conditions, and that saline-alkali soil could not be completely improved without completely changing the water-salt conditions of the soil. We only saw one aspect of "salt comes with water, and salt goes with water," and did not see the subjective dynamic role of people in regulating the water-salt dynamics, regarding saline-alkali soil improvement as an increase or decrease in the amount of salt and alkali, and not seeing the qualitative changes that cultivation and fertilization bring to soil improvement. When it came to improvement, it was always drainage, and when it came to drainage, it was always "critical depth," engaging in sophistry, mystifying things, issuing wild opinions, saying that this measure was a palliative and that measure was a radical cure, without realizing that "palliative" and "radical" are also relative. Some measures are palliative from the current point of view, but radical from the point of view of development, palliative measures create conditions for radical cures, and radical cures are inherent in palliative measures. Under certain conditions, "radical" and "palliative" can also transform into each other.

Scientific Research Must Be Guided by Mao Zedong Thought
Chairman Mao instructed us: "Without a correct political viewpoint, it is like having no soul." In the past, I always thought that politics and the business of saline-alkali soil improvement were not directly related, but that is not the case. As early as before studying flower alkali soil improvement, we had also engaged in several years of research on the improvement of coastal saline soil. Although at that time we had also proposed some preliminary inferences based on the investigation and summary of mass experience, such as the coastal saline soil being in a natural desalinization process, and proposed some ways and measures for improvement; our work, however, stopped there, without returning these preliminary understandings to the practice of coastal saline soil improvement to continue to verify and develop them, to further complete "a leap from rational knowledge to revolutionary practice." Furthermore, we had also stayed in villages before, but always "only saw the point move, but did not see the point blossom." We could not make up our minds to stay at a point. Upon careful inspection, the main problems were also issues of standpoints and viewpoints, lacking a wholehearted service to the people, and not standing firmly on the proletariat's position. In fact, without highlighting politics, specific business work cannot be done well. Taking agricultural regionalization and planning work as an example, the old approach was a large pile of charts and data, which took a long time and was wasteful, seeing things but not people, seeing people but not class, and the regionalization produced was basically armchair theorizing, with little effect. Not long ago, I participated in a planning survey on changing the low-yield appearance of a saline-alkali soil area. The working method was mainly to start by grasping production, grasping class struggle, and grasping typical investigations, taking root among the poor and lower-middle peasants, following the mass line, adhering to the combination of leaders, technical cadres, and the masses, making historical investigations, and investigating from production practice. Therefore, in a very short time, we found that the main root causes of agricultural production in this area were: "land is thin, waterlogging is heavy, alkali land is much, cultivation is rough, seeds are mixed, and layout is chaotic," and proposed corresponding governance policies and measures. The planning made in this way has a broad mass production practice base and is relatively practical and feasible. This was a great inspiration and education for me: work of the same nature, one is guided by politics, and the other is not guided by politics; one is to follow the mass line, and the other is to break away from the masses. Two positions, viewpoints, and methods, two results, one is more, faster, better, and more economical, and the other is less, slower, worse, and more expensive. I began to realize that there are indeed struggles between two lines in scientific and technological work. As Chairman Mao taught us: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are branded with a class." In our ideological field, if it is not guided by Mao Zedong Thought, bourgeois ideology will raise its head. Therefore, it is necessary to break the bourgeois world outlook and establish the proletarian world outlook, and to transform one's own subjective world while transforming the objective world. I must strive to study Chairman Mao's works, listen to Chairman Mao's words, use Chairman Mao's thoughts to arm my mind, serve the people wholeheartedly, contribute all my strength to quickly changing the low-yield appearance of the flower alkali soil area, and to building socialism.

    “真正亲知的是天下实践着的人”
    ——花碱土改良工作的几点认识和体会
    中国农业科学院江苏分院　赵守仁
    群众给我们上的第一堂课
    江苏省的淮北平原地区，有一种盐碱质的低产土壤。这里在历史上受过黄河泛滥的影响，这种土壤就发育在这些黄泛沉积物上，同好地插花分布，含有盐碱分，盐渍类型复杂。根据性态，群众分别称之为瓦碱、面碱、卤碱等等。由于在分布上是花花搭搭的，盐渍性态又比较复杂，能扫盐提硝，又能熬盐取卤，所以群众统称之为“花碱土”。这种土壤，最初我生搬硬套所谓“发生学土壤分类”，认为它既非盐土，又非碱土，把它归之于草甸土类，并给它取了个洋名叫：“发育于石灰性黄河冲积物上的盐渍化浅色冲积草甸土”。说起来颇费劲，听起来也别扭。特别是，种植在这种土壤上的庄稼，由于返盐冒碱，缺苗严重，出了苗也长不好。明明是盐碱的问题，硬要叫它草甸土，也不切合实际。一九五八年，我们在一次棉花缺苗问题的考察中，调查了七十七块典型田，发现很多不出苗或者是死苗的田，往往含盐量并不高，而主要是碱性重。虽然这种土壤不具备书本上所说的那一些碱土的典型特征，那时我们也没有承认它是碱土，但群众通过多年的生产实践，对“碱”的危害性，体会得特别深刻，明确称它“碱土”。群众这样叫是完全有道理的。我们觉得“花碱土”这个名称，比草甸土更能形象地反映这类盐渍土壤的生产性能和性态特点。所以尽管受到一些同志的责难，我们还是毅然采用了“花碱土”这个很科学的名词。这是在接触和认识花碱土过程中，群众给我们上的第一堂课。我们深深感到，事实的确如毛主席所教导的：“真正亲知的是天下实践着的人”。这一事实也说明洋框框、老概念对我们影响之深。
    群众的生产实践经验是科学研究的丰富宝藏
    改造花碱土，首先就得正确地认识花碱土，知己知彼，才能百战百胜。但对花碱土是怎样形成的，为什么会花花搭搭分布，今后盐渍动向怎样等等一系列的问题，初上来，我们可以说一点也不了解。解决这个问题，是依靠群众还是依靠书本，是深入实际从调查研究入手，还是钻故纸堆查资料，从关门作试验入手，这是工作方法问题，也是思想方法问题。毛主席早就指出：“实践的观点是辩证唯物论的认识论之第一的和基本的观点。”前几年，我们违背了毛主席这一教导，不是放下知识分子的臭架子，向祖祖辈辈和花碱土打交道的群众请教，而依然是翻书本，找“洋拐棍”。当时我们千方百计找到一本外国的所谓盐渍土权威的关于盐渍土发生与演变的巨著，如获至宝，朝夕死啃，结果除了得到一些似是而非的概念，把我们的脑筋弄得更糊涂外，并没有得到什么灵感和启示。直到一九五九年，在雎宁县蹲点期间，偶尔听到几个老农谈“牛瘦生癞，地薄起碱”，“粪多能压碱”等，才启发我们，联想到是不是土壤的盐碱动态同肥力变化息息相关。这是我们在花碱土发生因素的研究中，初次引入了“肥力”的概念。根据这个线索，我们又发现大田盐碱斑下的地下水含盐量常较其四周的好地高的现象。结合学习《矛盾论》，我们认识到：“事物发展的根本原因，不是在事物的外部而是在事物的内部，在于事物内部的矛盾性。”我们进一步联想到，土壤的肥力、耕层的水分平衡同盐碱化可能有密切关系。在耕层土壤水分平衡中，蒸发和渗漏起着决定性的作用；而这两个作用本身又是对立的统一，蒸发大于渗漏，会导致土壤的盐碱化；相反，蒸发小于渗漏，会导致土壤的脱盐。就影响耕层土壤水分平衡的各种因素分析，耕层土壤本身的属性，特别是肥力，是内因，其它是外因，外因通过内因起作用，即通过肥力的变化，影响耕层土壤水分平衡，使土壤脱盐或盐碱化。这些想法在一九六二年所进行的花碱土扩大问题的专题考察中，在总结群众翻黑土改良的经验中，都得到了进一步的验证。在这些概念的基础上，我们作出了“土壤肥力是影响耕层土壤水量平衡的主要因素”，“花碱土的形成是在耕层土壤不同的渗漏蒸发条件下，所引起的盐碱积累、再分配和转化的结果”等有关花碱土发生的若干推论，突出了培肥在花碱土改良中的作用和地位。它体现了人在改造客观世界过程中的主观能动作用，补充和发展了已有的改良盐碱土的论点，为今后较好地制定花碱土改良措施，提供了一定的理论依据。同时也使我们开始体会到广大群众的经验是科学和智慧的丰富宝藏。科学家的作用，在很大程度上不过是把群众的经验集中起来，经过加工上升到理论而已；不相信群众，不依靠群众，便什么也搞不成。
    科学研究要结合当前的生产实践
    研究花碱土是为了改良花碱土，但研究花碱土应该走什么路，是先研究规律再研究措施呢，还是结合措施研究规律？问题的实质是“学科带任务”，还是“任务带学科”。这个问题在我们的思想认识上解决得很晚。我们曾经一度想关起门来搞土壤的“盐分平衡”、“水—盐动态”、“碱性转化机制”等所谓理论性的课题。对几百年、几千年、几万年前的事，兴趣很大，认为一谈盐碱土的发生和改良，不追溯远古，不谈古地理、古地貌、水化学、盐化学一套，便不足以表现科学上的高水平。相反地，对当前生产上存在的问题，却兴趣不大。当时我们错误地认为，只有把这些摸清楚了，才能对症下药提出措施来。结果花了不少时间和精力，没有搞出什么名堂，特别是和地方生产上的需要对不上口径，工作费劲，到处碰壁，自己也很苦恼。另一方面，在一些比较切合生产需要的小课题上，却打开了花碱土改良研究的局面，如研究棉花的保苗问题，认识了花碱土土层盐分分布上重下轻的特点。研究花碱土的耕作措施，认识了花碱土“七八月地如筛，九十月爬上来”的盐分动态规律。推广田菁，从几十亩到上百万亩，初步总结出大面积的田菁栽培利用和保苗经验。从大面积推广应用“以磷增氮”的方法，初步认识了花碱土上田菁、苕子等绿肥施磷增产的作用和有效施用条件等等。这些都大大地丰富了花碱土改良研究的内容，同地方生产对上了口径，也为农民所欢迎。这一活生生的事实，使我们对毛主席所教导我们的话：“你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。”“离开实践的认识是不可能的”，有了更深刻的体会。只有结合措施研究规律，结合盐碱土改良的生产实践研究盐碱土的改良，才能真正认识盐碱土，使盐碱土改良学科生气蓬勃，不断向前发展。单纯为学科而学科的作法，只会使学科变成“无源之水、无本之木”，变成干巴巴的教条。
    通过实践检验和发展理论
    对于花碱土改良，在不断碰钉子的过程中，终于也取得了一些初步的认识，对如何改良，也提出了一些初步的看法。这些看法就是：排水是改良的重要途径，培肥是改良的根本措施，强调水肥结合综合治理，提倡浅排，结合雨季排水，除涝防渍排盐，加强耕作控制返盐等。我们把这些论点放在铜山县花碱土改良试验站的大面积生产实践中进行了验证。通过开沟、种绿肥、深耕、松土等农—水结合综合治理的办法，原来不能长庄稼的地，绝大部分开始能长庄稼了，土质显著变好。一九六四年和一九六五年夏熟三麦等作物，都比邻近生产队成倍增产。这一成绩，加强了我们工作的信心，也使我们认识到自己在思想方法上的片面性。过去我们认为盐碱土的形成与一定的水文地质条件有关，不彻底改变土壤的水—盐状况，就不能彻底地改良盐碱土。只看到“盐随水来，盐随水去”的一方面，看不到人在调节水—盐动态中的主观能动作用，把盐碱土改良看成是盐碱的数量上的增减，看不到耕作培肥对土壤改良所起的质的变化。一谈起改良，就是排水，一谈排水，就是“临界深度”，搞烦琐哲学，故弄玄虚，乱发议论，说这个措施是治标的，那个措施是治本的，而没有体会到“标”和“本”也是相对的。有的措施从当前来说是治标的，从发展来看又是治本的，治标为治本创造条件，治本即寓于治标之中。在一定条件下，“本”和“标”也可相互转化。
    科学研究工作必须以毛泽东思想挂帅
    毛主席指示我们：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”以前我总认为政治和盐碱土改良业务的本身没有直接的联系，事实不然。早在研究花碱土改良以前，我们还曾搞过好几年的滨海盐土的改良研究工作，虽然当时我们也曾在调查总结群众经验的基础上，提出过滨海盐土处于自然脱盐过程等一些初步的推论，提出过一些改良的途径和措施；但我们的工作却是到此为止，没有把这些初步的认识再回到滨海盐土的改良实践中去继续验证和发展，去进一步完成“从理性的认识到革命的实践这一个飞跃”。再如以前我们在农村中也蹲过点，但老是“只见点搬家，不见点开花”。对蹲点下不了决心。仔细检查起来，主要的毛病也都是立场和观点问题，缺乏全心全意为人民服务的观点，没有站稳无产阶级立场。事实上，不突出政治，具体业务工作也搞不好。以农业区划、规划工作为例，老一套的搞法是图表数据一大堆，旷日费时，见物不见人，见人不见阶级，搞出来的区划，基本上是纸上谈兵，作用不大。不久前我参加了一次盐碱土地区改变低产面貌的规划调查，工作方法主要是从抓生产、抓阶级斗争、抓典型调查入手，扎根在贫下中农中间，走群众路线，坚持领导、技术干部、群众三结合，作历史的调查，从生产实践中调查，所以在很短的时间内，就找出了这个地区在农业生产上主要的病根子是：“土地瘦，涝渍重，碱地多，耕作粗，种子杂，布局乱”，提出了相应的治理方针和措施。这样作出的规划，有广泛的群众生产实践基础，比较切实可行。这对我的启发和教育很大：同样性质的工作，一种是政治挂帅，一种是政治不挂帅；一种是走群众路线，一种是脱离群众。两种立场、观点、方法，两种结果，一是多快好省，一是少慢差费。我开始体会到在科学技术工作中，的确也存在两条道路斗争问题。正如毛主席教导我们的：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”在我们的思想领域中，如果不是毛泽东思想挂帅，资产阶级思想就会抬头。所以必须破资产阶级世界观，立无产阶级世界观，在改造客观世界的同时，也改造自己的主观世界。我一定要努力学习毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，用毛主席的思想来武装自己的头脑，全心全意为人民服务，为迅速改变花碱土地区的低产面貌，为建设社会主义贡献自己的一切力量。
