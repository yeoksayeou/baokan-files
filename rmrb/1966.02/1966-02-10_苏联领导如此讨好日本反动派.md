    Newspaper lists numerous facts about Soviet leaders' desperate efforts in diplomacy, economy, and culture to court and appease Japanese reactionaries, proving that Soviet-Japanese relations have entered a "new stage" of mutual collusion to "contain China."
    The Japanese newspaper *Asahi Shimbun* published a report on January 31 entitled "The Soviet Union Leaning Towards Japan," an excerpt of which follows:
    From last year to this year, the Soviet Union's active stance of leaning towards Japan is very noteworthy. In the last half-year alone, the Soviet Union has taken many significant measures one after another.
    During Foreign Minister Shiina's visit to the Soviet Union, he discussed with Soviet leaders a wide range of international political issues beyond the scope of a simple Japan-Soviet "bilateral relationship," such as the Vietnam War, disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation, and strengthening the United Nations.
    The Soviet Union's leaning towards Japan began in the spring of 1963. The fishery negotiations, which had always been called the "Hundred Day Negotiations," were settled in just forty days in April of that year. In June, the Soviet Union agreed to conclude the long-pending agreement on safe seaweed harvesting around Kaigarajima. In August, it issued a note releasing all detained crew members. This is how "Soviet smile diplomacy" began.
    In 1963, the Soviet Union intensified its efforts to cultivate a peaceful atmosphere for diplomacy with the West, (therefore) it naturally sought to strengthen good neighborly relations, and launching "smile diplomacy" towards Japan was part of this.
    During Foreign Minister Shiina's visit to the Soviet Union this time, although the Soviet Union did not make new concessions on the territorial issue, it expressed a moderate attitude of "both sides are prepared to conclude a peace treaty on the basis of recognizing the status quo" and agreed to properly handle the issue of safe fishing around Habomai and Shikotan. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Gromyko stated his willingness to visit Japan and hoped that Prime Minister Sato would visit the Soviet Union. Overall, as Premier Kosygin pointed out, "Japanese-Soviet relations have entered a new stage."
    The economic relationship, which is intertwined with this political approach between Japan and the Soviet Union, has also steadily developed.
    Post-war Japanese-Soviet trade expanded rapidly after Japan and the Soviet Union signed a joint declaration in October 1956. In 1956, the total trade volume (imports and exports) was only 3.63 million US dollars, while in 1965 (statistics up to the end of November), the total trade volume (imports and exports) was 371.77 million US dollars, which is more than one hundred times the actual trade volume of ten years ago, in 1956.
    If economic cooperation in developing Soviet Siberia can be realized in the future, it is expected that (trade) will expand further. At the upcoming 23rd Congress of the CPSU, a new five-year plan will be decided. In this plan, if positive and concrete measures are stipulated for the development of Siberia and Japan is asked to cooperate, then Japanese-Soviet economic relations may enter a newer stage.
    In terms of cultural relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, although no government-to-government agreement has been signed, cultural exchanges between the two countries have recently been very frequent and multifaceted. This year, Daiei and Gorky Film Studio are jointly producing the first Japanese-Soviet co-produced film, *Friendship* (tentative title). According to the agreement between the Ministry of Education and the Soviet State Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, two Soviet university professors have already visited Japan as the first batch of scholars to exchange visits. From these aspects, even before the conclusion of a comprehensive government-to-government agreement, Japanese-Soviet cultural exchanges are steadily and smoothly making constant progress.
    A clear sign showing the close relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union in politics, economy, and culture is that the transportation lines connecting Japan and the Soviet Union have been shortened and the roads have been widened.
    Currently, among the transportation lines between Japan and the Soviet Union, the Nakhodka sea route connecting Japanese ports and Nakhodka and the Black Sea route connecting Odessa and Novorossiysk were opened in June 1958 as sea routes for the transshipment of regular cargo.
    In May 1961, the Soviet Far Eastern Shipping Company (headquartered in Vladivostok) opened a sea route from Nakhodka to Yokohama. Utilizing this passenger sea route to connect with the Siberian Railway, and then connecting with the air route from Khabarovsk to Moscow, has the characteristic of being the most economical route from Japan to the Soviet Union and then to Eastern and Western Europe.
    In the past, air routes mainly consisted of the northern route from Tokyo via Anchorage and Copenhagen and the southern route via New Delhi and Tashkent. However, if the direct air route from Tokyo to Moscow over Siberia opens in June, it can greatly shorten the time and reduce freight costs.
    At the same time, Japanese-Soviet cooperation is also expanding to taking joint actions on the international stage. The Soviet Union had already jointly proposed a ban on nuclear testing with Japan in May 1957. During Shiina's visit to the Soviet Union this time, extensive international political issues beyond the scope of "Japan and the Soviet Union" such as the Vietnam conflict, comprehensive disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation, and strengthening the United Nations were discussed, and even the results of the talks were included in a joint communiqué, which is an epoch-making event.
    Even the term "Moscow-Tokyo Axis" has been used (according to the London *Times*), but it is said that the US State Department believes that this is mainly due to the Soviet Union taking the initiative. *Le Monde*, the most influential newspaper in France, commented that the Soviet Union's approach to Japan is out of a political aim to make Japan break away from the United States and (by doing so) overwhelm China.
    In any case, the Soviet Union will certainly approach Japan more actively in the future.

### 苏联领导如此讨好日本反动派

专栏：外论摘要

    苏联领导如此讨好日本反动派
    日报列举苏联领导在外交、经济和文化等方面拼命拉拢和讨好日本反动派的种种事实，证明苏日关系已进入了相互勾结以“遏制中国”的“新阶段”
    日本《朝日新闻》一月三十一日刊载一篇报道，标题是《靠拢日本的苏联》，摘要如下：
    从去年到今年，苏联积极靠拢日本的姿态是很值得注意的。在最近不到半年的时间里，苏联一个接着一个地采取了许多重大措施。
    椎名外务大臣在这次访问苏联时，同苏联领导人讨论了超过单纯是日苏“两国间”的范围的越南战争、裁军、防止核扩散、加强联合国等广泛的国际政治问题。
    苏联靠拢日本是自一九六三年春天开始的。历年都叫作是“百日谈判”的渔业谈判，在这一年只用了四十天便在四月份谈妥。六月份，苏联答应缔结过去悬而未决的在贝壳岛周围安全采摘海带的协定，八月份发出释放全体被扣留的船员的照会，“苏联的微笑外交”就是这样开始的。
    一九六三年苏联加紧培植对西方外交的和平气氛，（因此）当然争取加强睦邻关系，对日展开“微笑外交”也是其中的一环。
    在这次椎名外务大臣访苏时，苏联虽然没有在领土问题上作出新的让步，但却表示了“双方准备在承认现状的基础上缔结和平条约”的温和态度，并且答应妥善处理齿舞、色丹周围安全捕鱼的问题。进而葛罗米柯外长表明愿意访日，并希望佐藤首相访苏。从总的来看，正象柯西金总理指出的那样，“日苏关系已经进入一个新阶段”。
    同这种日苏在政治上的接近互为表里的经济关系，也有了稳步的发展。
    战后日苏贸易从一九五六年十月日苏签署联合宣言以后迅速地扩大了。一九五六年的贸易额进出口合计只不过是三百六十三万美元，而一九六五年（到十一月末的统计）进出口合计为三亿七千一百七十七万美元，是十年前即一九五六年的实际贸易额的一百倍以上。
    今后如果能够实现开发苏联西伯利亚的经济合作，预料（贸易）还会进一步扩大。在即将举行的苏共第二十三次大会上将决定新的五年计划，在这个计划中，如果对开发西伯利亚规定积极而具体的做法，并要求日本给予合作，那么，日苏经济关系就可能进入一个更新阶段。
    日苏两国在文化关系方面，虽然还没有签订政府之间的协定，但是最近以来两国间的文化交流却是非常频繁而多方面的。今年还特别由大映和高尔基两影片公司联合拍摄第一部日苏合制的影片《友情》（暂定片名）。根据文部省和苏联对外文委缔结的协定，作为第一批学者互访，苏联两名大学教授已经访日。从这些方面来看，在尚未缔结政府间的全面协定以前，日苏文化交流正在稳步而顺利地不断取得成绩。
    表明日苏间在政治、经济、文化上有紧密关系的明显标志是，连结日苏两国的交通线缩短了，道路加宽了。
    现在日苏间的交通线中，连结日本各港口和纳霍德卡的纳霍德卡海上航线和连结敖得萨、诺伏罗西斯克的黑海海上航线，都是在一九五八年六月作为转运定期货物的海上航线而通航的。
    一九六一年五月苏联远东船舶公司（总部在海参崴）开辟了从纳霍德卡到横滨之间的海上航线。利用这条客运海上航线同西伯利亚铁路连接，再同从哈巴罗夫斯克到莫斯科的空中航路连接，具有从日本到苏联进而到东欧、西欧去的最经济的航线的特点。
    空中航线，过去是以从东京经恩科拉琪、哥本哈根的北线和经过新德里、塔什干的南线为主的，可是，从六月份要是经过西伯利亚上空的东京到莫斯科的直通空中航线开航的话，可以大大地缩短时间、降低运费。
    同时，日苏合作也正在扩大到在国际舞台上采取联合行动。苏联已经在一九五七年五月联合日本提出禁止核试验的联合提案。在这次椎名访苏时讨论了越南纠纷、全面裁军、防止核扩散、加强联合国等超出“日苏”两国间范围的广泛的国际政治问题，甚至把会谈的结果载入联合公报，这是划时代的事情。
    甚至已经使用“莫斯科—东京轴心”（据伦敦《泰晤士报》）的措词，不过，据说美国国务院认为这主要是由于苏联采取了主动。法国最有影响的报纸《世界报》评论说，苏联接近日本是出于想使日本摆脱美国并（通过这样做）压倒中国的政治目的。
    无论怎么说，苏联今后肯定将更加积极地接近日本。
