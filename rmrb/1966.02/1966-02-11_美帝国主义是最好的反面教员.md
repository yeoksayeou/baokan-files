    U.S. Imperialism is the Best Teacher by Negative Example
    By Our Correspondent
    Another large-scale anti-American storm has erupted in the Dominican Republic.
    Last September, U.S. imperialism imposed the so-called "Reconciliation Act" on the Dominican people. It adopted methods such as confiscating the weapons of patriotic soldiers and civilians and ousting officers of the rebel army, thinking that it could be peaceful from then on. However, the Dominican people did not "reconcile" with U.S. imperialism. The continuous anti-American struggles in the past few months show that the Dominican people and U.S. imperialism are irreconcilable, and the Dominican national independence movement cannot be suppressed.
    The revolutionary movement in the Dominican Republic is developing in depth. The awareness of the Dominican people is constantly improving. Last April, the spearhead of the Dominican people's struggle was directed at the traitorous dictatorial regime of Cabral, a running dog of U.S. imperialism; then, the Johnson government carried out armed intervention, and the streets of Santo Domingo echoed with shouts of "Yankees, go home!"; now, the Dominican people have taken to the streets again, not only opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression against the Dominican Republic, but also opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam.
    U.S. imperialism's armed intervention, in its subjective wishes, is to try to stifle the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, but in its objective effect, it precisely promotes revolutionary struggles. This is the case in the Dominican Republic, in South Vietnam, and in the Congo (Léopoldville). U.S. imperialism is playing the role of a teacher by negative example.
    To make the revolution victorious, a teacher by negative example is indispensable. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: The revolutionary people always have to repeatedly undergo education from both positive and negative aspects before they can mature and have the guarantee of winning victory. If there are only positive teachers and no negative teachers, the revolution will not be victorious.
    U.S. imperialism is the most reactionary force of our time, and it is also the number one teacher by negative example in our time. It carries out armed aggression everywhere; wherever the people of a country rise up in revolution, it sends troops to suppress them. It carries out subversion and intervention everywhere, arbitrarily interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, creates coups, and imposes the running dogs it has raised on the people of various countries. It establishes military bases everywhere, infringes upon the sovereignty of various countries, and threatens the security of various countries. In this way, it has most widely mobilized the people of the world and promoted the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. Wherever it acts most ferociously, the contradictions between the people there and U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are particularly acute, creating a revolutionary situation. Just as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Imperialism drives the great masses of the people throughout the world into the historical epoch of struggle to eliminate imperialism."
    U.S. imperialism's role as a teacher by negative example is determined by its imperialist nature. Although it sometimes uses various political deception methods in an attempt to disintegrate the fighting will of the people of various countries and stop the struggles of the people of various countries. However, the contradictions between U.S. imperialism and the people of various countries are irreconcilable. Therefore, its deception methods cannot succeed. This forces it to resort to naked violent means again. For the revolutionary people, whether U.S. imperialism's soft or hard tactics are the most meaningful and vivid teaching materials by negative example.
    Since last April, U.S. imperialism, this teacher by negative example, has given the Dominican people several lessons. Tens of thousands of troops occupying Santo Domingo is one lesson. The concoction of the "Reconciliation Act" and the establishment of a "provisional government" is another lesson. Now, the U.S. aggressor troops are suppressing demonstrators and killing patriotic people in the capital of the Dominican Republic, which is another lesson. U.S. imperialism will continue to give lessons, and the revolutionary struggle of the Dominican people will continue to develop in depth until final victory is achieved.

    美帝国主义是最好的反面教员
    本报评论员
    多米尼加又一次爆发了声势浩大的反美风暴。
    去年九月，美帝国主义把所谓“和解法”强加在多米尼加人民头上。它采取了收缴爱国军民武器、排挤起义军官等手法，以为从此可以太平了。但是，多米尼加人民并没有同美帝国主义“和解”。几个月来接连不断的反美斗争，表明多米尼加人民同美帝国主义是势不两立的，多米尼加的民族独立运动是无法抑止的。
    多米尼加的革命运动正在深入发展。多米尼加人民的觉悟正在不断提高。去年四月，多米尼加人民的斗争矛头指向美帝国主义的走狗卡夫拉尔卖国独裁政权；接着，约翰逊政府进行了武装干涉，圣多明各的街头响起了“美国佬，滚回去”的吼声；现在，多米尼加人民又走上街头，不仅反对美帝国主义对多米尼加的侵略，并且也反对美帝国主义对越南的侵略。
    美帝国主义的武装干涉，在主观愿望上，是想扼杀各国人民的革命斗争，而在客观效果上，恰恰是促进了革命斗争。在多米尼加是如此，在南越是如此，在刚果（利）也是如此。美帝国主义就是起着反面教员的作用。
    要使革命取得胜利，反面教员是不可缺少的。毛泽东同志曾经指出：革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。如果只有正面教员而没有反面教员，革命是不会取得胜利的。
    美帝国主义是当代最反动的势力，也是当代天字第一号的反面教员。它到处进行武装侵略，那一个国家的人民起来革命，它就要派兵镇压。它到处进行颠覆和干涉，恣意干涉别国内政，制造政变，把它所豢养的走狗强加在各国人民头上。它到处建立军事基地，侵犯各国的主权，威胁各国的安全。这样，它就最广泛地动员起了全世界的人民，推动了各国人民的革命斗争。凡是它搞得穷凶极恶的地方，那里的人民同美帝国主义及其走狗的矛盾就特别尖锐，造成了革命的形势。正象毛泽东同志所说的：“帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代”。
    美帝国主义充当反面教员，是它的帝国主义的本性所决定了的。尽管有时它也采用各种政治欺骗手法，企图瓦解各国人民的斗志，制止各国人民的斗争。但是，美帝国主义同各国人民的矛盾是不可调和的。因此，它的欺骗手法是不能得逞的。这就使它又不得不乞灵于赤裸裸的暴力手段。对革命人民来说，不管美帝国主义的软的一手也好，硬的一手也好，都是最有意义和活生生的反面教材。
    从去年四月以来，美帝国主义这个反面教员已经给多米尼加人民上了好几课了。数万大军侵占圣多明各，这是一课。炮制“和解法”，成立“临时政府”，这是一课。现在，美国侵略军在多米尼加首都镇压示威群众，枪杀爱国人民，这又是一课。美帝国主义还是会继续上课的，多米尼加人民的革命斗争也将随之而不断深入发展，直到取得最后的胜利。
