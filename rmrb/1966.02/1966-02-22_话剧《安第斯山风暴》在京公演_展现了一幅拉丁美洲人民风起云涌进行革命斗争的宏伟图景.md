　　The Drama "Storm over the Andes" Premieres in Beijing
　　Displaying a Grand Panorama of Latin American People Rising Up in Revolutionary Struggle
　　Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: The eight-act drama "Storm over the Andes," reflecting the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Latin American people, officially premiered in the capital today. This is the first large-scale drama created and performed by Chinese artists with the revolutionary struggle of the Latin American people as its subject.
    Friends from many Latin American countries, after watching the performance during the previews before the official premiere, praised the drama for realistically reflecting the reality of the Latin American people's anti-American revolutionary struggle. A Latin American foreign guest from the foothills of the Andes Mountains said that "Storm over the Andes" presents people with a grand panorama of the Latin American people rising up in revolutionary struggle, and is an epitome of the storm of the Latin American people's anti-American struggle.
    Through the emergence of a peasant armed guerrilla force, and under the correct leadership of Marxists-Leninists, their ascent to the Andes Mountains, the establishment of rural revolutionary base areas, the extensive mobilization of peasants and Indians, and the continuous development and strengthening of themselves, finally achieving victory in a surprise attack on an American military base, the drama focuses on revealing that the broad masses of people in Latin America, known as the backyard of the United States, have awakened and ignited the revolutionary flames against American imperialist aggression and for national independence. The drama also mercilessly exposes the crimes of American imperialism, which, under the pretext of opposing the "communist threat," intensifies its aggression against Latin America and cruelly massacres and suppresses the revolutionary people of Latin America.
    "Storm over the Andes" was created and performed by the Drama Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The artists of this drama troupe regard the creation and performance of "Storm over the Andes" and support for the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Latin American people as the glorious task of revolutionary artists. They began the creation of the script in March last year. In the creative process, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's statements on supporting the anti-American patriotic struggles of the people of all countries and on internationalism, people's war, and other issues, and collected a large amount of information on the anti-American patriotic struggles of the Latin American people. They also received many instructions from relevant leading comrades on the theme, character shaping, and artistic treatment of the script, which continuously improved the quality of the creation.
    During the rehearsal of the drama, they also received enthusiastic help from some Latin American friends who came to China for visits. They told the actors stories of the Latin American people's anti-American revolutionary struggle, helped the actors become familiar with the customs and habits of the Latin American people, and some even enthusiastically taught the actors Latin American folk dances.
    Before the official premiere of the drama, more than sixty previews had been held, widely soliciting opinions from all parties, and repeated revisions were made.

　　话剧《安第斯山风暴》在京公演
　　展现了一幅拉丁美洲人民风起云涌进行革命斗争的宏伟图景
    新华社二十一日讯　反映拉丁美洲人民反美爱国斗争的八场话剧《安第斯山风暴》，今天在首都正式公演。这是中国文艺工作者创作并演出的第一个以拉丁美洲人民革命斗争为题材的大型话剧。
    来自拉丁美洲许多国家的朋友，在公演前的预演期间看了演出以后，称赞话剧真实地反映了拉丁美洲人民反美革命斗争的现实。一位来自安第斯山山麓的拉丁美洲外宾说，《安第斯山风暴》，给人们展现了一幅拉丁美洲人民风起云涌进行革命斗争的宏伟图景，是拉丁美洲人民反美斗争风暴的缩影。
    话剧通过一支农民武装游击队的产生，和他们在马克思列宁主义者的正确领导下，登上安第斯山，建立农村革命根据地，广泛发动农民和印第安人，不断发展壮大自己，最后取得奇袭美国军事基地的胜利，集中地揭示了被称为美国后院的拉丁美洲，广大人民群众已经觉醒，燃烧起了反对美帝国主义侵略，争取民族独立的革命烽火。话剧还无情地揭露了美帝国主义借口反对“共产主义威胁”，加紧扩大对拉丁美洲的侵略，残酷屠杀和镇压拉丁美洲革命人民的罪行。
    《安第斯山风暴》是中国人民解放军总政治部文工团话剧团创作并演出的。这个话剧团的文艺工作者，把创作和演出《安第斯山风暴》，支持拉丁美洲人民反美爱国斗争，看作是革命文艺工作者的光荣任务，从去年三月就开始了剧本的创作。在创作过程中，他们反复学习了毛主席关于支持世界各国人民反美爱国斗争的声明和关于国际主义、人民战争等问题的论述，收集了大量拉丁美洲人民反美爱国斗争的资料。他们还从有关领导同志那里，得到了对剧本的主题思想、人物塑造和艺术处理等方面的许多指示，使创作质量不断提高。
    话剧排练期间，还得到来中国访问的一些拉丁美洲朋友的热情帮助。他们给演员们讲拉丁美洲人民反美革命斗争的故事，帮助演员熟悉拉丁美洲人民的风俗习惯，有的还热情地教演员跳拉丁美洲民间舞蹈。
    话剧正式公演以前，已经预演了六十多场，广泛征求各方面的意见，并进行了反复修改。
