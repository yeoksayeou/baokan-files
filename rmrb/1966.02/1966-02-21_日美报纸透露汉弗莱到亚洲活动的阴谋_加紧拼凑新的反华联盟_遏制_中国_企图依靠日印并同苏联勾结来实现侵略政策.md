　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: The Japanese newspaper *Asahi Shimbun* recently published a report from its Saigon correspondent stating that after the Honolulu conference, U.S. Vice President Humphrey immediately conducted activities in various countries and regions around China, indicating that the U.S. is adapting to the current situation of the Vietnam War and launching a diplomatic offensive aimed at a strategy of containing China. The purpose of this new U.S. diplomatic offensive is to "unite the countries around China into an anti-China front."

　　The report further stated: The new U.S. diplomatic offensive, militarily, aims to take the unity of South Korea, the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, and South Vietnam as its core, "establishing several stable areas around it (China) in order to maintain a balance of power between the U.S. and China in Asia." The report said, "Japan and India are becoming the center of the stable Asian forces expected by the United States." The U.S. also "relies on strengthening the friendly relations between Japan, India, and the Soviet Union to realize the above-mentioned intentions of the United States."

　　The newspaper also stated that the visit to Japan next month by the South Vietnamese puppet Nguyen Cao Ky, and the current visit to South Vietnam and other places by the South Korean puppet Park Chung-hee, "are closely related to the U.S. diplomatic offensive."

　　A dispatch from Honolulu on the 14th by a *Washington Post* reporter also revealed that the purpose of Humphrey's current activities in some Asian countries and regions is to piece together a new anti-China "alliance" in Asia. The report said that the main purpose of Humphrey's current visit to Asia is "to do in the Pacific what the United States has done in the Atlantic in the past. That is to form a new alliance." "First, to get America's Asian 'allies' to send another 20,000 to 25,000 troops to participate in the Vietnam War. But in the long run, it is to lay the foundation for an alliance with a broader scale and stricter purpose than the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

　　日美报纸透露汉弗莱到亚洲活动的阴谋
　　加紧拼凑新的反华联盟“遏制”中国
　　企图依靠日印并同苏联勾结来实现侵略政策
    据新华社十七日讯　东京消息：日本《朝日新闻》最近刊登了它驻西贡记者的报道说，美国副总统汉弗莱在檀香山会议以后，立即到中国周围各国和一些地区进行活动，表明美国正在适应着越南战争的现状，展开以遏制中国的策略为目标的外交攻势。美国这一新的外交攻势的目的，是“把中国周围的各国，团结在反中国的阵线里”。
    报道进一步说：美国的新的外交攻势，在军事上是想以南朝鲜、台湾蒋介石集团和南越的团结为中心，“在其（中国）周围建立几个稳定地区，以图在亚洲维持美中两种力量的均衡”。报道说，“日本和印度正在成为美国所期待的稳定亚洲势力的中心”。美国还“依靠加强日本、印度这两个国家同苏联的亲善关系，来实现美国的上述打算”。
    这家报纸还说，南越傀儡阮高其下月的访问日本，南朝鲜傀儡朴正熙目前的访问南越等地，“都同美国的外交攻势有着密切的联系”。
    美国《华盛顿邮报》记者十四日从檀香山发出的一条消息，也透露汉弗莱目前在亚洲一些国家和地区活动的目的是为了在亚洲拼凑新的反华“联盟”。报道说，汉弗莱目前访问亚洲的主要目的，“是在太平洋做美国过去在大西洋所做的事。这就是结成一个新的联盟。”“首先要使美国的亚洲‘盟国’再出二万到二万五千名军队参加越南战争。但是从长期看，它是要为一个比东南亚条约组织具有更广泛规模和具有更严格目的的联盟奠定基础。”
