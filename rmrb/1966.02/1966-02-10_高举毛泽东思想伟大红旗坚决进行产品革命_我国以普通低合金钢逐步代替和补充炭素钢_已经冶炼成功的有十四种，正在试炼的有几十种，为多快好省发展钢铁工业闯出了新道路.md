    Xinhua News Agency, February 9th - Iron and steel industry workers in our country, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have smashed "foreign conventions" and blazed a new path for our country's own development of the iron and steel industry. This is to gradually replace and supplement traditional carbon steel with ordinary low-alloy high-strength steel.

    Carbon steel is known as the "overlord" in the modern world's steel industry, and it has dominated the steel industry for over a hundred years. At present, except for a few high-grade, precision, and specially required products using alloy steel, the vast majority of steel materials for mechanical products, transportation tools, and buildings are made of carbon steel. Carbon steel production accounts for about 90 percent of steel production in various countries around the world. In the past, our development of the steel industry was basically focused on carbon steel, following the old path of others, and not daring to cross the line. However, products made of carbon steel, from the perspective of practical use, are bulky, prone to fracture, not corrosion-resistant, and have a short service life, failing to meet the requirements of our country's economic development.

    Dare to break "foreign conventions" and take our own path? Dare to create new steel types to replace ancient carbon steel? Dare to have a great revolution in the development of our country's steel industry? This has become a major issue facing our country's steel industry workers during the period of rapid national economic development. At the time, there were two different views on this issue. Some people with "slave mentality" [referring to those who blindly follow foreigners], although they also saw that carbon steel had many shortcomings, were worried and did not dare to touch its position, let alone imagine revolutionizing carbon steel. However, many people with revolutionary spirit said: We can no longer wallow in old foreign steel types, cannot follow in the footsteps of others, and should innovate and develop. They said that the Daqing people used Mao Zedong Thought to remove the label of backwardness from our country's petroleum industry; why can't we steel workers hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and blaze a trail for developing our country's steel industry? They were determined to challenge carbon steel, the "overlord" of the steel industry.

    Once Mao Zedong Thought takes command in the field of metallurgical science and technology, it will generate a powerful spiritual force and bear abundant fruit. Today, a brand-new path for developing the steel industry has been pioneered by our country's metallurgical workers. This is to develop ordinary low-alloy steel, using our country's rich and diverse alloy elements, to replace carbon steel while developing high-alloy steel. Fourteen types of ordinary low-alloy steel have already been successfully smelted, and dozens more are being trial smelted. They smelt this ordinary low-alloy steel using ordinary smelting equipment and ordinary smelting methods, but these ordinary low-alloy steels have great advantages. Products made from them have high strength, good performance, are corrosion-resistant, wear-resistant, and have a service life extended by 30 percent to 100 percent. In some applications, ordinary low-alloy steel can also replace some nickel-chromium alloy steel.

    Ordinary low-alloy steel is a new steel type created by our country's steel industry departments in their technical work, following Chairman Mao's teachings, vigorously carrying out technical revolution, and taking the mass line. In the process of creation, they implemented the three-in-one combination of workers, technicians, and leading cadres, and also implemented the three-in-one combination of scientific research departments, production departments, and user departments.

    The manufactured ordinary low-alloy steel has been widely used in our country's transportation, machinery, chemical, petroleum, and construction sectors. Steel rails, locomotives and vehicles, ocean-going vessels, automobiles, tractors, pressure vessels, power station equipment, bridges and large buildings made of ordinary low-alloy steel all have very good quality. The manufactured equipment has improved accuracy and efficiency, reduced volume, reduced weight, and extended service life. The railway department's lines laid with low-alloy steel rails have already passed more than 100 million tons of freight, with less rail wear and a service life one to two times longer than that of carbon steel rails. The Jiefang brand automobiles made of ordinary low-alloy steel have reduced their weight, correspondingly increased their load capacity, and accelerated their running speed.

    There is great potential for our country to develop ordinary low-alloy steel. At present, our country has discovered and developed a large number of polymetallic symbiotic ores and various alloy resources, which provides extremely rich material conditions for the large-scale development of ordinary low-alloy steel in the future. In the past, some foreign metallurgical experts believed that our country's polymetallic symbiotic ores were impossible to process and smelt, and they labeled these ores with the accusation of "complex ores are difficult to smelt." Our country's steel workers studied Chairman Mao's works and realized that unfavorable factors can be transformed into favorable factors. They repeatedly explored and experimented in production practice, and finally broke through the smelting difficulties of symbiotic iron ore, overturning the conclusions made by those foreign "experts," and making the rich symbiotic iron ore make important contributions to our country's steel industry development and socialist construction.

    Fully utilizing our country's mineral resources and developing ordinary low-alloy steel is a path for developing our country's steel industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This will enable us to establish our own steel product system and help our country's steel product varieties and quality catch up with and surpass the world's advanced levels as soon as possible.

    Relevant departments believe that this product revolution that is taking place in our country's steel industry will drive the revolution of the entire metallurgical industry. At the same time, this revolution also poses new challenges to processing and user departments. The structure of many building and mechanical products, many processing techniques, and welding techniques must be reformed accordingly. Some experience has been initially accumulated in these areas.

    In order to better produce and widely promote the use of ordinary low-alloy steel, the State Economic Commission and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently jointly convened a special meeting in Beijing with representatives from twenty-five departments, including metallurgy, machinery, railways, transportation, and construction, to summarize and exchange experience in these areas.

    The Third Five-Year Plan has begun. All departments of the national economy are working hard to climb technical peaks, and need a large number of technically new and highly efficient equipment, which requires the steel industry to provide more varieties and better quality steel. To this end, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has decided that this year it will substantially increase the production of ordinary low-alloy steel to meet the needs of all parties.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗坚决进行产品革命
    我国以普通低合金钢逐步代替和补充炭素钢
    已经冶炼成功的有十四种，正在试炼的有几十种，为多快好省发展钢铁工业闯出了新道路
    新华社九日讯　我国钢铁工业职工高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，大破“洋框框”，闯出了一条我国自己发展钢铁工业的新道路。这就是以普通低合金高强度钢来逐步代替和补充传统的炭素钢。
    炭素钢被称为现代世界钢铁工业中的“霸王”，它统治钢铁工业已经有一百多年。目前世界上除少数高级、精密和有特殊要求的产品用合金钢以外，绝大多数的机械产品、交通运输工具和建筑物的钢铁材料都是用炭素钢。炭素钢产量占世界各国钢产量的百分之九十左右。我们过去发展钢铁工业，基本上也是在炭素钢上作文章，沿着别人的老路走，不敢越雷池一步。然而，用炭素钢做的产品，从使用的实践看来，粗大笨重，容易断裂，不耐腐蚀，使用寿命不长，不能满足我国国民经济发展的要求。
    敢不敢打破“洋框框”走自己的路子？敢不敢创造新的钢种来代替古老的炭素钢？敢不敢在我国钢铁工业的发展上来个大革命？这就成了我国国民经济大发展时期，摆在我国钢铁工业职工面前的一个大问题。当时，对于这个问题有两种不同的看法。有些有“贾桂”思想的人，虽然也看到炭素钢有许多缺点，但是他们忧心忡忡，不敢去触动它的地位，更不敢去设想革炭素钢的命。而许多具有革命精神的人却说：我们不能再在外国老钢种上打滚，不能踩着别人的脚印走，应当有所创新，有所发展。他们说，大庆人运用毛泽东思想，为我国摘掉了石油工业落后的帽子；我们钢铁工人为什么不能高举毛泽东思想红旗，闯出一条发展我国钢铁工业的道路来？他们决心向炭素钢这个钢铁工业的“霸王”挑战。
    毛泽东思想一旦在冶金科学技术领域里挂了帅，就会产生强大的精神力量，结出丰硕的果实。如今，一条崭新的发展钢铁工业的道路被我国冶金职工闯出来了。这就是在发展高合金钢的同时，利用我国丰富多样的合金元素发展普通低合金钢，来代替炭素钢。现在已经冶炼成功的有十四种普通低合金钢，正在试炼的还有几十种。他们炼这种普通低合金钢，仍然是用普通的冶炼设备，普通的冶炼方法，但是炼出的这些普通低合金钢却具有很大优越性。用它们做的产品，强度高，性能好，耐腐蚀，耐磨损，使用寿命延长百分之三十到一倍。在某些用途方面，普通低合金钢还可以代替一部分镍铬合金钢。
    普通低合金钢是我国钢铁工业部门在技术工作中，遵循毛主席的教导，大搞技术革命，走群众路线创造出来的新钢种。他们在创制过程中，实行了工人、技术人员和领导干部的三结合，又实行了科学研究部门、生产部门和使用部门的三结合。
    已经制成的普通低合金钢，已经大量地应用到我国交通、机械、化学、石油和建筑等部门。用普通低合金钢材做成钢轨，机车车辆，远洋轮船，汽车，拖拉机，压力容器，电站设备，修建桥梁与大型建筑物等等，质量都很好。制成的设备，精度和效率提高了，体积缩小了，重量减轻了，使用寿命延长了。铁路部门用低合金钢轨铺设的线路，已经通过一亿吨以上的货运量，钢轨磨损少，寿命比炭素钢轨延长一到二倍。采用普通低合金钢制作的解放牌汽车，自重减轻了，装载量相应地提高了，而运行速度却加快了。
    我国发展普通低合金钢是大有可为的。目前我国已经发现和开发了大量多种金属共生矿和多种合金资源，这就为今后大规模地发展普通低合金钢提供了极为丰富的物质条件。过去有些外国冶金专家认为，我国多种金属共生的矿石是无法处理和冶炼的，他们给这些矿石安上了“复杂矿石难冶炼”的罪名。我国钢铁工人学习了毛主席著作，认识到不利因素可以转化为有利因素，他们在生产实践中反复探讨与试验，终于突破了共生铁矿石的冶炼难关，推翻了那些外国“专家”所下的结论，使丰富的共生铁矿为我国钢铁工业发展和社会主义建设作出了重要的贡献。
    充分利用我国的矿物资源，发展普通低合金钢，这是一条多快好省发展我国钢铁工业的道路，这样就能够建立起我国自己的钢铁产品系统，而且有利于促使我国钢铁产品的品种和质量尽快地赶上和超过世界先进水平。
    有关部门认为，我国钢铁工业正在进行的这场产品革命，将会带动整个冶金工业的革命。同时，这场革命，也给加工使用部门提出了新课题。许多建筑与机械产品的结构，许多加工工艺和焊接工艺，都必须作相应的改革。目前在这些方面已初步积累了一些经验。
    为了更好地生产和广泛推广使用普通低合金钢，最近国家经委和冶金工业部共同在北京召开了有冶金、机械、铁路、交通和建筑等二十五个部门代表参加的专门会议，总结和交流了这些方面的经验。
    第三个五年计划已经开始了。国民经济各部门都在努力攀登技术高峰，需要大量技术新、效率高的设备，这就要求钢铁工业提供品种更多、质量更好的钢材。为此，冶金工业部已经作出决定，今年要大幅度地增产普通低合金钢，满足各方面的需要。
