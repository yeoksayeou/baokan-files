    On the eve of the fifth anniversary (February 4th) of the Angolan people's armed uprising, a reporter interviewed several young guerrilla fighters from the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola who had recently come from the Cabinda region in northern Angola. They were all in high spirits, ready to hold their guns tightly and carry the struggle against Portuguese colonial rule for independence and freedom through to the end.

    Arming Ourselves with the Enemy's Weapons

    Nineteen-year-old Swobomo is a fighter in a guerrilla squad in the Cabinda region. Initially, the squad had sixteen people, but only six guns and some grenades. One day, a hunter reported to them that fourteen Portuguese soldiers were patrolling in a nearby forest. Upon receiving this information, they immediately ambushed the road in the jungle. After waiting for two hours, the enemy swaggered down the road. As soon as the enemy approached the ambush circle, they rushed out like lions, killing thirteen enemies and seizing all their weapons. This guerrilla squad gradually grew stronger in such flexible and mobile battles.

    Ambush in the Forest

    Gendenggo was a railway signal worker before joining the guerrilla force. He said that his squad encountered an enemy three or four times their number one day. They cleverly lured the enemy into an ambush circle near a bridge, quickly wiped them out, and blew up the bridge. He said that in this ambush, they only had grenades, machetes, and locally made rifles called "Kang Han Gu Luo." He said: "In forest ambushes, we can see the enemy, but the enemy cannot see us. We fight for our liberation without fear, but the enemy is very afraid of death. That is why these enemies equipped with modern weapons often suffer defeats and flee."

    First Time in Battle

    Benba, who is about twenty years old, was originally a student, but he had to drop out of school due to extreme poverty under Portuguese colonial rule. He said that in one fierce battle, a group in his detachment destroyed an enemy jeep and a truckload of enemies with landmines. Then, his group rushed out, attacking with dense firepower and annihilating the enemy. Benba recalled how he felt when he participated in his first battle: "When I held a gun in my hand and fought alongside my comrades for the motherland, I gained tremendous courage."

    These guerrilla fighters said that in the Cabinda region, the vast majority of residents send them information, as well as water, bananas, and cassava. When the enemy comes to search, the residents do everything possible to help them and shelter them. With the help and support of the people, the guerrilla force has gradually grown stronger.

    Never Lay Down Our Guns

    Guerrilla fighter Benba told reporters that in the Angolan guerrilla force, many soldiers enjoy reading Chairman Mao Zedong's works very much, and they even put small booklets of Chairman Mao's military works in their pockets when fighting. He said: "We study Chairman Mao's works and apply them in battle, thereby gaining our experience." Referring to Chairman Mao's famous assertion that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," he said: "When we fight the enemy with guns, we think that this is to seize power, and we must never lay down our weapons."

    These guerrilla fighters are filled with infinite confidence in the victory of the Angolan people's armed struggle. They stated that they will further improve their political awareness and tactical skills in the struggle, and give the Portuguese colonial army a greater blow. (Xinhua News Agency, Brazzaville)

    安哥拉游击战士紧握枪杆子
    他们喜读毛主席著作，懂得了枪杆子里面出政权
    在安哥拉人民武装起义五周年（二月四日）的前夕，记者访问了最近来自安哥拉北部喀奔达地区的几位安哥拉人民解放运动的青年游击队员。他们个个斗志昂扬，准备紧握手中枪，把反对葡萄牙殖民统治、争取独立自由的斗争进行到底。
    用敌人武器武装自己
    十九岁的斯沃波莫是喀奔达地区一个游击小队的战士。起初，这个小队有十六个人，但是，只有六支枪和一些手榴弹。有一天，一个猎人向他们报告：十四名葡萄牙士兵在附近树林中巡逻。他们得到这个消息后，立刻在路旁的丛林中埋伏下来。一直等了两个小时，敌人才大摇大摆地从路上走过来。他们等敌人刚一走近伏击圈，就象狮子般地冲出去，杀死了十三名敌人，夺取了他们的全部武器。这支游击小队就在这样机动灵活的战斗中逐渐发展壮大起来。
    在森林里伏击
    根登戈在加入游击队之前是铁路信号工人。他说，他的小队有一天遇到了人数比他们多三四倍的敌人。他们机智地把敌人诱到一座桥附近的伏击圈内，迅速消灭了敌人，并且炸毁了那座桥。他说，在这次伏击战中，他们只有手榴弹、砍刀和当地人民叫作“康汉古洛”的土制步枪。他说：“在森林里进行伏击战，我们看得见敌人，敌人却看不见我们。我们毫无畏惧地为自己的解放而战斗，敌人却非常怕死。正因为如此，这些配备现代化武器的敌人往往吃败仗和逃跑。”
    第一次参加战斗
    大约二十岁的奔巴本来是个学生，但是在葡萄牙殖民统治下，他由于非常贫困而不得不停学。他说，在一次激战中，他的一个小分队里的一个小组用地雷炸毁了敌人的一辆吉普车和一卡车的敌人。接着，他的小组冲了出去，用密集的火力进行攻击并且歼灭了敌人。奔巴回忆他参加第一次战斗时的感觉时说：“当我手里握着枪，同战友们一道为祖国而战的时候，我就有了巨大的勇气。”
    这些游击队员说，在喀奔达地区，广大的居民给他们送情报，还给他们送水、送香蕉、木薯。当敌人前来搜查的时候，居民们千方百计帮助他们和掩护他们。游击队在人民的帮助和支持下逐渐发展壮大起来。
    决不放下枪杆子
    游击队员奔巴对记者说，在安哥拉游击队里，许多战士非常喜欢阅读毛泽东主席的著作，他们甚至在战斗时也把毛主席的军事著作的小册子放在口袋里。他说：“我们学习毛主席的著作，在战斗中运用，从而取得了我们的经验。”他谈到毛主席的著名论断“枪杆子里面出政权”时说：“当我们拿着枪同敌人作战时，我们想到，这是为了夺取政权，我们决不能放下武器。”
    这些游击战士们对安哥拉人民武装斗争的胜利充满着无限的信心。他们表示，今后将在斗争中进一步提高政治觉悟和战术技术，给予葡萄牙殖民军更大的打击。　　（新华社布拉柴维尔通讯）
