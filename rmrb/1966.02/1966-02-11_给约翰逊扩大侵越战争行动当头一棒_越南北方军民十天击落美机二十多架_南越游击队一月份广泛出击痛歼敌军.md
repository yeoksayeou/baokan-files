    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th - According to a report from our correspondent: Since January 31st, when American imperialism resumed bombing of North Vietnam, up to the 7th, the heroic North Vietnamese military and civilians have shot down 22 American bandit planes and damaged many others in just eight days, capturing many American pilots alive. This is a powerful response from the North Vietnamese military and civilians to Johnson's escalation of the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The heroic North Vietnamese military and civilians, like their heroic Southern counterparts, are growing stronger and more victorious in the war. On January 31st – the first day that American imperialism arrogantly resumed bombing of North Vietnam – the American air bandits suffered a head-on blow: nine jet fighters were shot down, and a number of pilots were either killed or captured. That day, the skies over North Vietnam were overcast, and there was drizzle in many areas. The American thieves attempted to take advantage of this weather to carry out surprise attacks and sabotage, but they were met with a head-on blow from the highly vigilant Vietnamese military and civilians. In Vinh City, Nghe An Province, an American F-105 "Thunderchief" jet fighter had just intruded into the airspace over the city when it was shot down by the first volley of fire from local military and civilians, and the American pilot on board was also shattered to pieces. In Quang Binh Province, after the first American plane was shot down, another American seaplane rushed to rescue the American pilot who had fallen into the sea, but it was also hit on the spot and buried at the bottom of the sea.
    The best battle was fought on February 3rd. On this day, the military and civilians of Nghe An Province wiped out a group of three American planes in one fell swoop and captured American pilots alive. At more than ten o'clock that morning, three American jet fighters came from the sea to bomb and strafe some residential areas and economic facilities in Quynh Luu County. The local military and civilians were filled with indignation and opened fire with all kinds of weapons, forming a dense network of fire that wiped out all three enemy planes. Some surviving American pilots parachuted into the sea, trying to escape. Militiamen armed with guns from the coastal area of Quynh Luu County immediately rowed small boats and pursued them swiftly. At this time, twelve enemy planes flew in, frantically bombing and strafing the militiamen's boats, attempting to cover and rescue the American pilots who had fallen into the water. At the same time, warships of the American Seventh Fleet also sailed in and fired wildly at the militiamen's boats and the coast. However, the heroic Vietnamese militiamen never retreated. They bravely advanced in the face of fierce fire from enemy planes and warships, fighting the enemy planes and the enemy warships at the same time. Each fishing boat was a fighting unit, and a sea net was cast instantly, surrounding the American thieves and capturing them one by one.
    The enemy planes and warships that attempted to rescue these American pilots were also driven away in disgrace by the fire of the Vietnamese military and civilians guarding the coastline.
    On the same day in the afternoon, the young "eagles" of the Vietnamese People's Air Force also spread their wings and fought the enemy planes again. In a situation where the enemy planes outnumbered them many times, they defeated the many with the few, shooting down two enemy planes in one fell swoop, demonstrating extraordinary courage and superb skills.
    On February 7th, the military and civilians of Hanoi also shot down an American high-altitude unmanned reconnaissance plane. This shows that no matter what kind of plane the American bandits send, they cannot escape the fire net covering the skies of North Vietnam.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th - According to an announcement made here on the evening of the 10th: The military and civilians of Thanh Hoa Province in North Vietnam shot down two American jet fighters on the 9th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th - According to a report from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the South Vietnamese guerrillas launched widespread attacks in January, cooperating with the Liberation Army to fight the enemy in a way that made them tremble with fear and suffer heavy casualties.
    In the battles against "sweeps," the guerrillas of Thanh Phuoc and other three communes in Binh Dai District, Ben Tre Province, bravely and intelligently defeated the attack of more than 400 enemies on January 11, killing and wounding more than 50 enemies. According to statistics, the guerrillas of Ben Tre Province annihilated more than 290 enemies in the first half of January alone.
    In Binh Thuan Province, from January 6th to 14th, the enemy mobilized four battalions of troops, under the cover of a large number of aircraft and M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, to carry out "sweeps" in some communes of Hoai Duc District. The local people and guerrillas fought bravely with deep hatred for the enemy, killing 38 American and puppet troops, wounding 15, and destroying and damaging two enemy helicopters.
    From January 4th to 9th, the guerrillas of Tan Uyen District, Bien Hoa Province, fiercely blocked and completely frustrated the "sweep" of more than 2,000 enemy troops near Phuoc Thanh City, killing and wounding more than 50 American aggressor troops and shooting down two American planes.
    In the first ten days of January, the guerrillas of Ba Ria Province continued to besiege and attack the enemy stronghold of Long Thanh. In many attacks, they annihilated 45 enemies (including two American aggressor troops) and shot down two enemy planes.
    From January 14th to 20th, the guerrillas of Go Quao and U Minh Thuong districts in Rach Gia Province successively destroyed the enemy strongholds located in Di Di, Long Thanh, Dinh An, and Dinh Hoa communes, annihilating many enemies and liberating 20,000 residents.
    On the night of January 7th, the guerrillas of Chau Thanh District, My Tho Province, wiped out the enemy's Long Huu stronghold, annihilating more than 30 enemies, capturing 15, and seizing many weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies. Long Huu commune was liberated.
    In January, the guerrillas of Binh Thuan Province killed and wounded more than 140 enemies, destroyed one helicopter, and destroyed three military vehicles in the battles against "sweeps" and attacking the enemy.
    Following the attack on the American military dormitory in Can Tho City on December 19th of last year, which killed and wounded nearly 30 enemies, the guerrillas of Can Tho Province infiltrated Can Tho City again on January 18th and used landmines to blow up the American military dormitory, killing 17 American engineering and technical personnel.
    On the night of January 13th, the guerrillas of Ba Tri District, Ben Tre Province, intelligently and bravely rushed into the enemy's wharf in Tan Thuy commune, wiped out two enemy platoons, and sank and damaged one enemy warship each.
    In mid-January, the guerrillas of Cai Be District and Chau Thanh District, My Tho Province, skillfully infiltrated the An Binh and An Tay "strategic hamlets" and carried out surprise attacks on the enemy, annihilating more than 40 enemies.
    In Tra Vinh Province, on January 15th, the guerrillas of Trung Nghia commune, Vinh Liem District, used landmines to blow up an enemy convoy on the highway, destroying one military vehicle and killing more than 20 enemies. (Attached picture)

### 给约翰逊扩大侵越战争行动当头一棒  越南北方军民十天击落美机二十多架  南越游击队一月份广泛出击痛歼敌军

    给约翰逊扩大侵越战争行动当头一棒
    越南北方军民十天击落美机二十多架
    南越游击队一月份广泛出击痛歼敌军
    新华社河内九日电　本社记者报道：自从一月三十一日美帝国主义对越南北方恢复轰炸以来，到七日为止，英雄的越南北方军民在短短八天中，已经打落美国强盗飞机二十二架，打伤多架，并且活捉了许多美国飞行员。这是越南北方军民对约翰逊扩大侵越战争行动的一个有力回答。
    英雄的越南北方军民同英雄的南方军民一样，正在越战越强，越打越胜。一月三十一日——美帝国主义气势汹汹地对越南北方恢复轰炸的第一天，美国空中强盗就挨了当头一棒：九架喷气式战斗机被击落，一批飞行员不是被打死就是被俘虏。这天，越南北方的空中乌云密布，许多地区细雨蒙蒙。美国飞贼妄图利用这种气候进行偷袭和破坏，但是却遭到了高度警惕的越南军民的迎头痛击。在义安省的荣市，一架美国F—105型“雷公式”喷气式战斗机刚刚窜入市区上空，就被当地军民的第一排火力所击落，机上的美国飞行员也粉身碎骨。在广平省，当第一架美国飞机被击落以后，另一架美国水上飞机赶来抢救落到海面上的美国飞行员，但这时它也被当场击中，葬身海底。
    打得最漂亮的一仗是二月三日。这一天，义安省军民一举全歼一批三架美国飞机，并且活捉了美国飞行员。这天上午十点多钟，三架美国喷气式战斗机从海上窜来，轰炸扫射琼琉县的一些居民区和经济设施。当地军民怒不可遏，使用各种武器一齐开火，组成了密集的火网，把三架敌机一网打尽。幸存的一些美国飞行员跳伞落到海上，企图逃跑。琼琉县沿海的民兵荷枪实弹，立刻划着小船，飞舟追击。这时，有十二架敌机飞来，疯狂地轰炸和扫射民兵的船只，妄图掩护和抢救落水的美国飞行员。同时，美国第七舰队的军舰也驶来向民兵船只和海岸疯狂炮击。但是，英雄的越南民兵决不后退，他们冒着敌机敌舰的凶猛炮火奋勇前进，一面打敌机，一面打敌舰。一只渔船就是一个战斗单位，顿时撒下了海上罗网，团团围住了美国飞贼，并且把他们一一俘获。
    企图营救这批美国飞行员的敌机和敌舰，也被守卫在海防线上的越南军民的炮火打得狼狈逃窜。
    在同一天下午，年青的越南人民空军的“雄鹰”也展翅飞腾，再次迎战敌机。他们在敌机成倍地多于自己的情况下，以少胜多，一举击落敌机两架，表现了非凡的勇敢和高超的技术。
    二月七日，河内市军民把一架美国高空无人驾驶侦察机也揍了下来。这说明，美国强盗不管是派什么飞机来，也无法逃脱越南北方军民的满天火网。
    新华社河内十日电　据这里十日晚上公布：越南北方清化省军民，九日击落美国喷气式飞机两架。
    据新华社河内十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方游击队一月份广泛出击，配合解放军打得敌人心惊胆战，伤亡枕藉。
    在反“扫荡”的战斗中，槟椥省平大县青福等三个乡的游击队，一月十一日英勇机智地击溃了四百多名敌人的进攻，打死、打伤敌人五十多名。据统计，槟枷省游击队单在一月上半月就歼敌二百九十多名。
    在平顺省，从一月六日到十四日，敌人出动了四个营的兵力，在大批飞机和M—113型两栖装甲车的掩护下，向怀德县的一些乡进行“扫荡”。当地人民和游击队怀着对敌人的深仇大恨，英勇战斗，共打死美军和伪军三十八名，打伤十五名，击毁和击伤敌人的直升飞机两架。
    边和省新渊县游击队从一月四日到九日，在福成市附近猛烈阻击和彻底挫败了二千多名敌军的“扫荡”，打死、打伤美国侵略军五十多名，击落美国飞机两架。
    一月上旬巴地省游击队继续包围并袭击龙盛敌军据点。在多次袭击中，共歼敌人四十五名（其中有两名美国侵略军），打落敌机两架。
    迪石省鹅高、榕莲等县的游击队从一月十四日到二十日七天中，接连摧毁了位于迪地、龙盛、定安、定和等乡的敌军据点，歼灭了许多敌人，使两万居民获得解放。
    堤岸省芹德县游击队在一月七日夜间拔除了敌人的隆友据点，歼敌三十多名，俘虏十五名，缴获许多武器弹药和其他军用物资。解放了隆友乡。
    平顺省游击队在一月份反“扫荡”和出击敌人的战斗中，共打死、打伤敌人一百四十多名，击毁直升飞机一架，击毁军车三辆。
    芹苴省游击队继去年十二月十九日袭击芹苴市美军宿舍，打死、打伤近三十名敌人之后，又于一月十八日潜入芹苴市区，用地雷爆炸美军宿舍，炸死美军中的工程技术人员十七名。
    一月十三日夜间，槟椥省巴知县游击队机智英勇地冲进新水乡敌人的码头，全歼敌人两个排，击沉和击伤敌军战船各一艘。
    堤岸省芹若县和周城县游击队在一月中旬巧妙地潜入安平和安西“战略村”，对敌人进行奇袭，歼灭敌人四十多名。
    在茶荣省，一月十五日，泳濂县中义乡游击队用地雷爆炸公路上的敌军一个车队，炸毁军车一辆，炸死敌人二十多名。（附图片）
