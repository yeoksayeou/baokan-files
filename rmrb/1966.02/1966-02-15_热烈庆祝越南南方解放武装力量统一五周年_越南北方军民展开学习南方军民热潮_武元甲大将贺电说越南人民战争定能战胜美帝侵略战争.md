    According to a dispatch from Hanoi by Xinhua News Agency on the 13th: The people and armed forces of North Vietnam have warmly launched a movement to learn from the heroic people and armed forces of South Vietnam, determined to take the heroes of the South as their role models, fight bravely, defend the North, and wholeheartedly support the people and armed forces of the South to thoroughly defeat the American aggressor bandits.
      Currently, this learning movement has penetrated into the various services and arms of the People's Army and the local armed forces, as well as the broad masses of militia and self-defense forces, forming a high tide of killing the enemy and practicing military skills.
    The People's Army air defense units fighting in the Vinh Linh area north of the 17th parallel and in the provinces of Quang Binh, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, and Thanh Hoa have all launched a competition of "Learning from the Southern Heroes and Shooting Down More Enemy Planes" in their battles. Commanders and fighters enthusiastically studied the deeds and combat experience of the southern combat heroes, determined to use outstanding achievements to congratulate the fifth anniversary of the unification of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces.
    A certain infantry regiment launched a competition to learn from the heroes in the South Vietnamese Van Tuong and Bau Bang victories in fighting tanks and close combat. A certain infantry regiment conducted a long-distance mountain road march with heavy loads, and all the soldiers reached their destination on time.
    The soldiers of a certain signal corps unit put forward slogans such as "Sitting at the telegraph machine is like sitting in a fighting position, and guaranteeing communication means annihilating American bandits" in combat. They often braved enemy bombing and strafing to protect communication equipment and successfully complete communication tasks.
    On the transportation front, the drivers of the 32nd detachment, inspired by slogans such as "For the sake of the South, which is flesh and blood, cherish the vehicle like a child, and transport it to the front line," launched a safe transportation competition, overcame all difficulties and dangers, and successfully completed arduous transportation tasks.
    The militia and self-defense forces in various parts of North Vietnam are actively learning and applying the experience of the South Vietnamese people in establishing "combat villages" and "combat townships," preparing to eliminate the American bandits and their lackeys who dare to invade.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 14th: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, on behalf of the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army, sent a telegram to the Command of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces on the 14th, warmly congratulating the fifth anniversary of the unification of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces.
    The telegram pointed out that the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, born and grown in the revolutionary struggle of the South Vietnamese people and under the correct leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, have rapidly grown into a steel-like army that is invincible in all battles and infinitely loyal to the cause of the people's liberation struggle.
    The telegram said that the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces eliminated thousands of hardships and difficulties with earth-shattering spirit, resolutely fought against the American aggressor bandits and their lackeys; developed the people's war to an unprecedented height in the history of our nation's liberation struggle, and achieved brilliant victories in the sacred patriotic war.
    The telegram said that since the US imperialism dispatched a large expeditionary force to directly invade South Vietnam, the glorious battles to annihilate the American aggressors and puppet troops that have been carried out successively on the South Vietnam battlefield have shown that the heroic South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians are fully capable of eliminating the most elite units of the American expeditionary force, attacking their most fortified bases, and annihilating and disintegrating the main forces of the puppet army in increasing numbers. In the new situation, the South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians continue to move forward, give play to their initiative, attack the enemy on all battlefields, and strive for ever greater victories.
    The telegram expressed the firm belief that no matter how brutal, stubborn, and cunning US imperialism is, the Vietnamese people will surely be able to defeat the American aggressor bandits under any circumstances, and the people's war of the heroic Vietnamese nation will surely defeat US imperialism's neo-colonialist war of aggression.
    The telegram concluded by saying that the Vietnamese People's Army is determined to further hold high President Ho Chi Minh's banner of "determination to defeat the American aggressor bandits," resolutely defend the North—the revolutionary fortress of the whole country, and wholeheartedly support the South's liberation revolution, so as to unify our beloved motherland.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 13th, the General Political Department of the Vietnamese People's Army issued instructions on the 12th regarding the fifth anniversary of the unification of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces (February 15th), calling on the entire army to strive to learn from the heroic South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians, wholeheartedly support the South's liberation revolution, launch a competition to complete all combat, training, and work tasks, and celebrate this festival with new achievements.
    The instructions require all officers and soldiers of the army to strive to learn the bravery, resourcefulness, and creativity of the heroic South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians and their extremely valuable combat experience; arouse hatred for the enemy, enhance combat will and combat skills, strengthen the determination to defeat the American aggressor bandits, strengthen the absolute victory confidence in the invincible people's war line and the sacred national anti-American and national salvation cause, and resolutely defeat US imperialism.
    The Vietnamese *People's Army Daily* also published a commentary on the 13th, calling on all officers and soldiers of the Vietnamese People's Army to learn from the heroic South Vietnamese soldiers and civilians and push the cause of resisting America and saving the nation to complete victory.
