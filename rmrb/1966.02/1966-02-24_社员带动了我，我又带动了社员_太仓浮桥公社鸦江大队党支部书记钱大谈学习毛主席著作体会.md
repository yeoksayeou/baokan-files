　　Editor's Note: This article introduces the situation of a production brigade studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works. Everyone studies, everyone applies, learning is lively, and application is solid, creating a thriving and vigorous scene throughout the entire brigade.

　　The worker-peasant masses study Comrade Mao Zedong's works not to write empty articles, but to solve practical problems. They learn a little, apply a little, learn what they urgently need, and apply what they learn, which is indeed immediately effective. The wife of production team leader Wen Baochang heard someone talk about "Serving the People" the previous evening and used it the next day to help her husband overcome his reluctance to be the team leader. Many young people, after studying "Combat Liberalism," immediately bravely fought against unhealthy phenomena. The situation here once again illustrates that the study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works must focus on application: learning for the sake of application is the only way to truly learn well; being able to apply what you learn is the only way to prove that you have truly mastered it.

　　Can people with low levels of literacy, or even illiteracy, study Comrade Mao Zedong's works? A poor peasant female commune member said, yes. Because "we have ears to listen, mouths to ask, and brains to think." Comrade Mao Zedong's books are written for the people, to guide the people in carrying out revolution and construction. Those who want revolution, even if they "don't know a peck of characters," can understand, accept, and apply them. Now, people with little literacy are walking ahead of some people with a lot of literacy, and the reason lies here.

    In the past, I always had this old frame of mind, believing that as long as I did my best, I could do a good job, and that studying or not studying was not important; besides, I only went to school for three years as a child, and my education was very low, so I couldn't learn anything. Last March, when I went to the Tenth Production Team, I found that they had written the experiences of Wang Zuxing and Wang Zuyu in studying Chairman Mao's works on a blackboard. These two people, one was the production team accountant, and the other was a commune member. I thought, they are both studying Chairman Mao's works, but I am the party branch secretary of the brigade and I haven't studied, how can that be? I became anxious. The team leader of this team also said to me: They have already formed a study group here, and they have studied several articles with very good results. I thought, this team was originally a backward team, but now that they have studied Chairman Mao's works, they have changed so quickly, it seems that studying Chairman Mao's books is very effective. I also thought, the commune members have studied Chairman Mao's works, and their ideological awareness has been further improved, if I don't study and still use the old methods of leadership, it won't work. In early April of last year, I began to study Chairman Mao's works.

    After studying, my revolutionary zeal became even greater, and no matter what difficulties I encountered, I had to do it. Once, the second team leader, Lu Zhendong, quarreled with his sister and was unhappy about being the team leader. I planned to go talk to him that night. Who knew, it started raining at night, my overshoes were broken, and I didn't have an umbrella, what to do? Go or not go? At this time, I thought of "Serving the People," Chairman Mao wanted us to be "absolutely selfless and devoted to others," why am I now considering personal problems? This is not right. Thinking of this, I put on a raincoat, went barefoot, and went to Lu's house with the chairman of the Poor Peasants Association, to talk to Lu Zhendong and his sister separately; the next day I went again, and the problem was solved. Another time, I mobilized the teams to cut green grass and make grass-mud ponds. When I told the commune members and cadres, the commune members said, we are not used to this here, and the land is sandy, so opening a pit will leak water, let's not do it! I thought, this is difficult! So I went to review "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" to see how Chairman Mao talked about it. Chairman Mao said, "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory." I thought about it and decided to resolutely engage in grass-mud ponds. In order to make the masses believe, I and a team leader personally opened a pit, and carried a few loads of mud and a few loads of water, and it did not leak. People from other teams who came to see it also felt it was feasible, and everyone did it.

    After tasting the sweetness, I thought: Doesn't "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" say that to do things, you only need to move "God"? Our "God" is the commune members and cadres, we must let them also study Chairman Mao's works well, improve their thinking, and then we can accomplish great things. Through studying "Methods of Work of Party Committees," I understood that to grasp everyone's study, we must first have a leader, so I convened a meeting of the party branch committee, and absorbed the chairman of the Poor Peasants Association, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, the militia battalion commander, and the women's director to participate. At the meeting, I talked about my learning experiences and introduced the changes that had taken place in the tenth team after studying. I said: "We want to mobilize the whole brigade to study Chairman Mao's works, you study first, apply first, is it okay?" In this way, the leaders of all fronts went back and studied first, and the members of the party branch committee also studied. Women's Director Zhou Jiafang had a great effect after studying. She used to be not very bold and did not dare to work boldly; now she knows her shortcomings, so she actively leads the women of her production team to study. Team leader Wen Baochang, had some ideological problems and was unhappy about being the team leader. His wife said to him after studying Chairman Mao's works: "It is wrong for you to be unhappy about being the team leader, you don't want to serve the people. Last night, I heard Zhou Jiafang talk about "Serving the People," Chairman Mao talked about a lot of reasons." As a result, Wen Baochang figured it out. Seeing that her own team was studying, Zhou Jiafang went to mobilize all the women's committee members of the brigade to study, and later, she mobilized the women of each small team to study. In this way, a climax of women studying Chairman Mao's works was set off throughout the brigade, and five learning pacesetters were also established.

　　After studying, Communist Youth League branch secretary Pu Chengming helped the young people in each team to study everywhere, and also organized educated youth to be instructors, going to the teams that did not have instructors to lecture. Poor Peasants Association Chairman Fei Lizhang, also mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's works. These leaders are all actively studying, actively working, everyone is more united, and the promoting role in the work is very large.

    After the leaders learn, they have to mobilize the production team cadres and commune members to study together. However, some commune members said, we are illiterate, how can we study Chairman Mao's works! Some said, we can only do a good job in production, studying is not feasible. Zhou Jiafang and I discussed it, and everyone felt that all the eleven points in "Combat Liberalism" were present in the commune members, so we should study this article first to ensure that it would clear their thinking. When each team studied "Combat Liberalism," it was indeed effective as soon as they studied it, and everyone linked it to their own thinking. The young people of the fifteenth team had long said: "Cadres are cadres, commune members are commune members, if we raise an opinion, in the future, when assigning work, it will be emphasized, and the work points will be less, and we can't stand it." Through studying "Combat Liberalism," their thinking was improved. Team leader Yang Zhigao expanded his house site to the collective field. The young people thought of Chairman Mao's criticism of "Don't concern yourself and keep away from trouble; know it is wrong but keep silent," and bravely raised their opinions to him. Yang Zhigao thought, occupying the collective field is wrong, and immediately withdrew. The masses' study thus opened a head. Not long after, we held a study experience exchange meeting, with the participation of brigade cadres, production team political captains, study activists, and educated youth. Six or seven people spoke at the meeting, talking about their learning experiences, and after they finished speaking, they discussed in groups. This exchange meeting pushed the masses' study even more vigorously.

    After the commune members studied Chairman Mao's works, their spiritual outlook changed, and there were more good people and good deeds. Fei Axiao of the fourth team was weeding in the cotton field and picked up two yuan and three cents. In the past, he often said: "Picking up a copper coin brings three cents of good fortune," but this time he asked everywhere and handed it over to the commune member who lost the money. Wen Mengchu of the eleventh team went to Fuqiao to watch a play, and when he heard that a fire had broken out in the Xinqiao brigade, he hurried to the fire scene. Seeing that a water hose was leaking, he took off his new silk-cotton jacket that he was going to wear for his wedding and wrapped it around the water pipe. He said: "Putting out the fire is a big matter, and my cotton jacket is a small matter." Some young people in the fifteenth team, in the past, "did not work properly, and were unwilling to give in when evaluating work points," but now, they are all scrambling to do good deeds. During the drought resistance, there were eight mu of fields that the machine could not water, and Zhu Yuanren brought the door panel of his house, took a long bench, and eight young people did not sleep all night, and watered the eight mu of fields that needed water.

    Everyone is increasingly demanding progress, and more than thirty people in the entire brigade have written reports requesting to join the Party and the League. I deeply realize that Mao Zedong Thought armed us, and there is a spiritual atomic bomb in the minds of our cadres and commune members, and no one can stop this force.

    I feel that although our brigade has made some achievements in studying Chairman Mao's works, there are still many problems. The best learners are women, Communist Youth League members, youth, militiamen, and Poor Peasants Association members. Some production team leaders have not yet studied well. In terms of commune members, the study is not universal enough. However, I am determined to continue to highlight politics, vigorously grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, and down-to-earthly work hard on "application," to further promote production.

### 社员带动了我，我又带动了社员　太仓浮桥公社鸦江大队党支部书记钱大谈学习毛主席著作体会

专栏：

　　社员带动了我，我又带动了社员
　　太仓浮桥公社鸦江大队党支部书记钱大谈学习毛主席著作体会
　　编者按：这篇文章，介绍了一个生产大队学习毛泽东同志著作的情况。大家学，大家用，学得生动，用得扎实，全大队一片朝气勃勃的兴旺景象。
　　工农群众学习毛泽东同志的著作，不是为了写空洞无物的文章，而是为了解决实实在在的问题。他们学一点，用一点，急用先学，学了就用，确是立竿见影。生产队长闻保埸的妻子，前一个晚上听人讲了《为人民服务》，第二天用来帮助丈夫打通了不想当队长的思想。许多青年人学了《反对自由主义》，立即勇敢地对不良现象作斗争。这里的情况再一次说明，学习毛泽东同志著作必须在用字上狠下功夫：为用而学，才能真正学好；会用了，才能证明真正学到手了。
　　文化水平不高，甚至不识字的人，能不能学习毛泽东同志的著作呢？一位贫农女社员说，能。因为“有耳朵可以听，有嘴可以问，有脑子可以想”。毛泽东同志的书是为人民写的，是引导人民干革命搞建设的道理。要求革命的人，即使“斗大字不识一升”，也能听懂，能接受，能运用。现在，识字不多的人走到了某些识字很多的人的前面，原因就在这里。
    以前，我脑子里总有这样一个老框框，认为只要自己尽一切力量，就可以做好工作，学习不学习，没啥要紧；再说我从小只读过三年书，文化很低，也学不来。去年三月里，我到第十生产队去，发现他们一块黑墙头上写着王祖兴、王祖玉学习毛主席著作的心得。这两个人，一个是生产队会计，一个是社员。我想，他们都在学毛主席著作，我是大队党支部书记，倒没有学，怎么行？心里着急起来。这个队的队长又对我说：他们这里已经成立了学习小组，学习了好几篇文章，效果很好。我想，这个队本来是一个后进队，现在学了毛主席著作，变得这样快，看来，学毛主席的书的作用大得很。我又想，社员都学了毛主席著作，思想觉悟越加提高，我不学，还用老一套领导方法，就不行了。去年四月初，我开始学毛主席著作。
    学习以后，自己的革命干劲更大了，不管碰到啥困难，都要干。有一次，二队队长陆振东跟他姐姐相骂，不高兴做队长了。我打算当天夜里去找他谈谈。谁晓得，夜里落起雨来，我的套鞋坏了，没有伞，怎么办？去还是不去？这时候，我想起《为人民服务》，毛主席要我们“毫不利己专门利人”，为什么现在又考虑个人问题？这不对。想到这里，我就顶着蓑衣，赤着脚，同贫协主席一道，冒雨到陆家，分头找陆振东和他姐姐谈话；第二天又去了一趟，就把问题解决了。又一次，我发动各队割青草搞草塘泥。我跟社员、干部一讲，社员说，我们这里没习惯，地又是砂土，开坑要漏掉水的，快点不要干！我想，这个事倒是难啊！就去翻看了一遍《愚公移山》，看毛主席是怎么讲的。毛主席讲，要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我想了想，就下定决心，坚决搞草塘泥。为了使群众相信，我和一位队长亲自开只坑，挑了几担泥、几担水，倒是不漏水。别的队来人看了也觉得行，大家都干了。
    我尝到甜头以后，就想：《愚公移山》上不是讲么，做事情，只要感动了“上帝”就行。我们的“上帝”是社员、干部，一定要让他们也学好毛主席著作，提高思想，才办得成大事。通过学习《党委会的工作方法》，我懂得了要抓大家的学习，首先要有一个头，就召集了一次党的支委会议，吸收了贫协主席、共青团支部书记、民兵营长、妇女主任参加。我在会上讲了自己的学习心得，还介绍了十队学习以后起的变化。我说：“我们要发动全大队学习毛主席著作，你们先学起来，用起来，行不行？”这样，各条战线的头头回去，先学了，党支部委员也学了。妇女主任周家芳学习之后，效果很大。她以前不大泼辣，不敢大胆工作；现在晓得了自己的缺点，便积极领导自己生产队的妇女们学习。队长闻保埸，有些思想问题，不高兴当队长。他老婆学习了毛主席著作以后就对他说：“你不高兴当队长是错的，是不想为人民服务。我昨天晚上，听周家芳讲了一篇《为人民服务》，毛主席讲了好多道理。”结果，闻保埸想通了。周家芳见自己队里学开了，又去发动全大队妇女委员学，后来，又发动各小队的妇女学。这样，全大队掀起了妇女学习毛主席著作的高潮，还树立了五个学习标兵。
　　共青团支部书记浦承明学习之后，到处帮助各队青年人学习，还组织知识青年当辅导员，到没有辅导员的队里去讲。贫协主席费礼章，也发动了贫农下中农学毛主席著作。这些头头都积极学习，积极搞工作，大家越加团结，对工作的推动作用很大。
    头头学起来了，就要去发动生产队干部、社员一道学。但是，有的社员说，我们不识字，那能学毛主席著作！有的说，我们只能搞好生产，学习是不行的。我和周家芳等一商量，大家觉得《反对自由主义》里的十一条，社员身上都有的，拿这篇文章先学，保证打得通思想。各队一学《反对自由主义》，果然一学就灵，大家都跟自己思想挂起钩来了。十五队的青年人老早就说过：“干部是干部，社员是社员，我们提了意见，将来派起活来重点，工分少点，吃不消。”通过学习《反对自由主义》，他们的思想提高了。队长杨志高把宅基地扩大到集体田上。青年们想起了毛主席批评的“事不关己，高高挂起；明知不对，少说为佳”，就勇敢地向他提了意见。杨志高一想，占集体田不对，马上退了出来。群众学习从此开了个头。不久，我们又开了一个学习心得交流会，有大队干部、生产队政治队长、学习积极分子、知识青年参加。六七个人在会上讲话，讲自己学习的心得，讲好后，又分组讨论。这次交流会一推动，群众学习就更有劲了。
    社员群众学习毛主席著作之后，精神面貌变了，好人好事多了。四队的费阿小在棉田里锄草，拾着二元三角钱。以前他常讲：“拾着铜钱三分福”，这次却到处问，交给了丢钱的社员。十一队的闻孟初到浮桥看戏，听到新桥大队失火，就赶忙跑到火场上。他见一条水龙管子漏了，就脱下结婚要穿的新的丝棉袄，裹在水管上。他讲：“救火是大事体，我一件棉袄是小事体。”十五队有些小青年，过去“做活不象样，评起工分不肯让”，现在，都抢着做好事。在抗旱的时候，有八亩田，机器打不上水，朱元仁到家里扛来了大门的门板，拿了长凳，八个青年人一夜未睡，车好了八亩田需要的水。
    大家越学越要求进步，全大队有三十多个人写了要求入党和入团的报告。我深深体会到：毛泽东思想把我们武装起来，我们干部、社员的头脑里就有个精神原子弹，这个力量，啥人也挡不了。
    我觉着，我们大队学习毛主席著作虽然有了一些成绩，但存在的问题也不少。学习得最好的是妇女、共青团员、青年、民兵、贫协。一些生产队长还没学好。在社员方面，学习还不够普遍。但是，我决心继续突出政治，大抓学习毛主席著作，踏踏实实地在“用”字上狠下功夫，进一步推动生产。
