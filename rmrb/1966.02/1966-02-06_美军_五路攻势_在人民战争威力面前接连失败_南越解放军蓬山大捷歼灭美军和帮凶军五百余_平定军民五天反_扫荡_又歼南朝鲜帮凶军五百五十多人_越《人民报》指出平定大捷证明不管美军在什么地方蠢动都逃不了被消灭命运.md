    Hanoi, February 5 (Xinhua) – According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province in South Vietnam achieved a great victory in the counter-"sweep" battle at Bong Son on January 28. Preliminary reports indicate that over 500 US troops from the US First Cavalry Division and South Korean accomplice troops were killed or wounded, eight US aircraft were shot down, and sixteen were damaged.
    On January 28, the US First Cavalry Division, South Korean accomplice troops, and South Vietnamese puppet troops launched the so-called "Masher Offensive" in Binh Dinh Province, conducting a large-scale "sweep" of the Bong Son area of Binh Dinh Province in an attempt to clear Highway 1, which had been cut off by the South Vietnamese military and civilians for a year. On the morning of the 28th, the enemy's vanguard was airlifted by a large number of helicopters to Zuo Ji, about four kilometers southwest of San Guan City, attempting to coordinate with enemy troops moving out of Bong Son to encircle the liberation armed forces in the area. However, as soon as this group of enemy troops stepped off the planes, they were immediately met with a fierce resistance from the liberation armed forces and were almost completely annihilated. Another three battalions of US and puppet troops, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, attempted three times to break into Zuo Ji to rescue the besieged enemy troops, but each attack was repelled by the liberation armed forces, leaving the corpses of American aggressors and puppet troops strewn across the field. On this day alone, the liberation armed forces almost completely annihilated one battalion of the US First Cavalry Division, shot down eight US aircraft, and damaged sixteen. Among the downed enemy aircraft was a heavy helicopter known as a "flying crane."
    On the 31st, two battalions of the US First Cavalry Division continued their "sweep" into the northern Bong Son area and were again met with fierce resistance from the liberation armed forces, causing heavy casualties to two US companies.
    Encouraged by this great victory, the military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province are currently continuing their heroic struggle to annihilate more American bandits and their running dogs, and resolutely and thoroughly smash the enemy's conspiracy to attack the liberated areas.
    Hanoi, February 5 (Xinhua) – According to supplementary reports from the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency, the military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province in South Vietnam annihilated a total of over 550 South Korean accomplice troops and shot down four enemy aircraft in the counter-"sweep" battles from January 9 to 13.
    From January 9 to 13, the American aggressors dispatched two regiments of South Korean accomplice troops and some security teams and civil defense forces of the South Vietnamese puppet troops to conduct a large-scale "sweep" of nine townships in the Sui Fu, An Ren, and Fu Ji counties of Binh Dinh Province.
    Before the "sweep," the enemy first used aircraft and artillery to bombard these townships, then rushed into the villages to massacre the people and burn down houses. In Jin Cai Village, Ren Lai Township, An Ren County, South Korean accomplice troops pushed forty women, elderly people, and children into a cave, then threw toxic gas bombs inside, killing everyone in the cave.
    The people and guerrillas of Jin Cai Village, filled with immense hatred for the enemy, dealt the enemy a fierce blow, annihilating 261 enemy soldiers in one fell swoop. On Height 66, the guerrillas also launched three consecutive attacks on the enemy in five days, annihilating nearly 100 enemy soldiers. In other villages, the enemy troops were constantly attacked, suffering heavy casualties.
    The guerrillas of Shi Chang Village, Ren Mei Township, An Ren County, also annihilated over 30 South Korean accomplice troops in a battle on January 13.
    Hanoi, February 5 (Xinhua) – The Vietnamese *People's Daily* published a commentary on the 5th, hailing the significant victories recently achieved by the military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province in South Vietnam in two counter-"sweep" battles, and pointing out that the American aggressors' conspiracy to attack and nibble at the liberated areas is bound to fail.
    The commentary said that just as the new year began, the military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province fought two beautiful victories: in the counter-"sweep" battles from January 9 to 13, they annihilated over 550 South Korean accomplice troops and shot down four American aircraft; in the counter-"sweep" battles that began on January 28, they annihilated over 500 aggressor troops of the US First Cavalry Division and South Korean accomplice troops, shot down eight American aircraft, and damaged sixteen.
    The commentary said that the military and civilians of Binh Dinh Province gave the American bandits and South Korean accomplice troops, who had committed countless barbaric crimes, a severe punishment. These new victories have powerfully struck at the conspiracy of the American bandits and their running dogs to attack, nibble at the liberated areas, and "pacify" the countryside.
    The commentary said that recently, in order to realize this conspiracy, US imperialism has successively launched large-scale "sweeps" in many areas of South Vietnam, with some "sweeps" even concentrating more than 10,000 troops. However, these enemy "sweeps" have all been defeated. From December 31 of last year to January 7 of this year, the military and civilians of the Xin An-Di An area defeated a large-scale "sweep" by the US puppet troops and their lackey troops, including two battle groups, and annihilated more than 800 enemy soldiers in one fell swoop. In January this year, the military and civilians of Jia Dinh Province also successively crushed two large-scale "sweeps" conducted by the US military and its lackey troops north and south of Gu Zhi County, annihilating more than 1,000 enemy soldiers; the military and civilians of Fu An Province annihilated three companies of South Korean accomplice troops. Currently, the military and civilians of Guang Yi Province are also heavily attacking the US Marine Corps conducting a large-scale "sweep" in the area near Guang Yi City. The commentary said that it is clear that no matter where the American bandits and their running dogs stir up trouble, they cannot escape the fate of being eliminated. The American bandits' conspiracy to attack, nibble at the South Vietnamese liberated areas, and "pacify" the countryside is bound to fail.
    Saigon, February 5 (Xinhua) – The American First Cavalry Division aggressor troops, which have suffered repeated setbacks near Bong Son in Binh Dinh Province, central coastal South Vietnam, brazenly used poison gas on an unprecedented scale on the 4th.
    According to the United Press International, these American aggressor troops launched the "largest-scale" "tear gas bomb" attack "since the Vietnam War" on the 4th against what were said to be the "trenches" and "bunkers" of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army about ten kilometers southwest of Bong Son. American helicopters equipped with special equipment for releasing poison gas dropped more than 600 "tear gas bombs" in a foothill area of only one square mile. At the same time, American aircraft also dropped poison gas bombs on areas that were confirmed to be "hiding" hospitals, including those of the Liberation Army.
    The news said that the US military "found nothing" in the poisoned area. "But after dropping gas bombs today (the 4th), some (American) helicopters again reported being attacked by (Liberation Army) ground fire from the same area."
    A week ago, the US First Cavalry Division launched a so-called "Masher Offensive" near Bong Son and used poison gas. Under the head-on blows of the heroic and resourceful South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces, the US military offensive was frustrated. The American aggressor troops changed the "Masher Offensive" to the "White Wing Offensive" from the 3rd, and strengthened the combat force to "division scale". According to Agence France-Presse, however, "Compared with the huge deployed army, the results so far have been limited."

    美军“五路攻势”在人民战争威力面前接连失败
    南越解放军蓬山大捷歼灭美军和帮凶军五百余
    平定军民五天反“扫荡”又歼南朝鲜帮凶军五百五十多人
    越《人民报》指出平定大捷证明不管美军在什么地方蠢动都逃不了被消灭命运
    新华社河内五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方平定省军民一月二十八日在蓬山反“扫荡”的战斗中取得大捷，据初步消息，已打死打伤美国第一骑兵师的美军和南朝鲜帮凶军五百多名，击落美机八架，击伤十六架。
    美国第一骑兵师、南朝鲜帮凶军和南越伪军一月二十八日在平定省发动了所谓“捣碎机攻势”，向平定省的蓬山地区进行了大规模的“扫荡”，企图打通已被越南南方军民切断了一年的第一号公路。二十八日早晨，敌人的先头部队由大批直升飞机空运到离三关市西南约四公里的左吉降落，企图同从蓬山出动的敌军配合包围这个地区的解放武装力量。但是这批敌军刚走下飞机，就立即遭到解放武装力量的猛烈阻击，几乎被全部歼灭。另外三个营美军和伪军在飞机和大炮的掩护下，三次企图冲入左吉去救援被围困的敌军，但是每一次进攻都被解放武装力量打退，美国侵略军和伪军横尸遍野。仅在这一天中，解放武装力量就几乎全歼美国第一骑兵师所属的一营美军，击落美机八架、击伤十六架，被击落的敌机中有一架是被称为“飞行起重机”的重型直升飞机。
    三十一日，美国第一骑兵师的两个营继续向蓬山北面地区展开“扫荡”，又遭到解放武装力量的猛烈阻击，使两连美军伤亡惨重。
    平定省军民在这次巨大胜利的鼓舞下，目前正在继续英勇战斗，以歼灭更多的美国强盗和他们的走狗军队，坚决彻底粉碎敌人进攻解放区的阴谋。
    新华社河内五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社补充报道：越南南方平定省军民在一月九日到十三日的反“扫荡”战斗中，共歼灭南朝鲜帮凶军五百五十多名，击落敌机四架。
    从一月九日到十三日，美国侵略者出动南朝鲜帮凶军两个团和南越伪军一些保安队、民卫队向平定省绥福、安仁、符吉等县九个乡进行大规模“扫荡”。
    敌人在“扫荡”前，先用飞机、大炮向这些乡进行狂轰滥炸，然后，冲进村庄大肆屠杀人民和烧毁房屋。在安仁县仁来乡金才村南朝鲜帮凶军把四十名妇女、老人和儿童推入地洞，接着向里面投掷毒气弹，使在地洞里的人全被毒死。
    金才村人民和游击队怀着对敌人无比巨大的仇恨，给敌军以猛烈的打击，一举歼灭敌军二百六十一名。在六十六号高地上，游击队在五天中也连续向敌人发动了三次进攻，歼敌近一百名。在其他各村，敌军也不断地遭到袭击，伤亡惨重。
    安仁县仁美乡释长村游击队在一月十三日的一次战斗中也歼灭南朝鲜帮凶军三十多名。
    新华社河内五日电　越南《人民报》五日发表评论，欢呼越南南方平定省军民最近在两次反“扫荡”战斗中取得的重大胜利，并且指出美国侵略者进攻和蚕食解放区的阴谋必定失败。
    评论说，刚刚进入新的一年，平定省军民就打了两场漂亮的胜仗：在从一月九日到十三日的反“扫荡”战斗中，歼灭南朝鲜帮凶军五百五十多名，击落美国飞机四架；在从一月二十八日开始的反“扫荡”战斗中，歼灭美国第一骑兵师的侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军五百多名，击落美国飞机八架，击伤十六架。
    评论说，平定省军民给予了犯下无数野蛮罪行的美国强盗和南朝鲜帮凶军以严厉的惩罚。这些新胜利有力地打击了美国强盗及其走狗进攻、蚕食解放区和“绥靖”农村的阴谋。
    评论说，最近，美帝国主义为了实现这个阴谋，接连在越南南方许多地区展开了大规模的“扫荡”，有些“扫荡”甚至集中了一万多兵力。但是，敌人的这些“扫荡”都遭到了失败。从去年十二月三十一日到今年一月七日，新安—堤岸地区军民就曾经击败了包括两个战团的美伪军以及仆从军的大规模“扫荡”，一举歼灭敌人八百多名。今年一月份，嘉定省军民也接连粉碎了美军及其仆从军在古芝县北面和南面进行的两次大规模“扫荡”，歼灭敌人一千多名；富安省军民歼灭了南朝鲜帮凶军三个连。目前，广义省军民也正在沉重打击在广义市附近地区进行大规模“扫荡”的美国海军陆战队。评论说，显然，不管美国强盗及其走狗在什么地方进行蠢动，都逃不了被消灭的命运。美国强盗的进攻、蚕食南越解放区和“绥靖”农村的阴谋必定失败。
    据新华社五日讯　西贡消息：在南越中部沿海平定省蓬山附近连遭挫败的美国第一骑兵师侵略军，四日悍然规模空前地使用毒气。
    据美国合众国际社报道，这批美国侵略军四日对蓬山西南约十公里地方被说成是越南南方解放军的“战壕”和“掩体”，发动了“越南战争以来规模最大”的“催泪性瓦斯弹”袭击。设有专门施放毒气的特殊装备的美国直升飞机，在面积只有一平方英里的山麓地区，就投掷了六百多枚“催泪瓦斯弹”。美国飞机同时还在被肯定为“隐藏着”包括解放军的医院的地区，投掷毒气弹。
    消息说，美军在放毒地区“什么也没有发现”。“但是在今天（四日）投掷了瓦斯弹之后，一些（美国）直升飞机再次报告受到同一个地区的（解放军）地面炮火的袭击”。
    在一个星期以前，美国第一骑兵师曾经在蓬山附近发动了一个所谓“捣碎机攻势”，并且施放过毒气。在英勇机智的越南南方解放武装力量的迎头痛击下，美军攻势受到挫败。美国侵略军从三日起把“捣碎机攻势”改名为“白翼攻势”，并且把作战力量加强到“师的规模”。据法新社报道，但是，“同部署的庞大的军队相比，迄今为止，结果是有限的。”
