    Spring Festival Train

    Wheels rumble, whistles sound, a Spring Festival train is speeding across the vast fields. This is a quick, scattered-freight train supporting agriculture, departing from Lianyungang and heading to Xuzhou. The crew consists of comrades from the advanced collective, the 705/6 quick, scattered-freight team of the Xuzhou Train Section. In a boxcar, the young freight handler Comrade Fan Decheng, covered in sweat, is stepping on thick cow dung and working diligently to clean it up.
    Originally, when the train was being assembled at Lianyungang Station, this boxcar, which had just unloaded cattle, was temporarily attached due to a shortage of vehicles. The station wanted to send someone to clean it, but there wasn't enough time. Not attaching it would mean one less car, reducing the amount of agricultural support materials that could be loaded along the way; attaching it would violate regulations that prohibit its use without cleaning and disinfection. At this moment, Fan Decheng recalled that their team had studied the New Year's Day editorial in the *People's Daily* before setting out. Everyone was determined to adopt a new combat posture to create a good start for the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan. He proactively suggested to the team leader: clean it on the train, and then load some materials that are resistant to dirt. Without waiting for others to speak, he took the lead and boarded the car. The unpleasant smell, the manure splattering all over his body, the sweat soaking his clothes... Fan Decheng ignored all of this. All he thought about was: cleaning up the manure as soon as possible, striving to load goods at an earlier station, and contributing to the effort to win a bumper harvest in agriculture.
    Before the train departed from Xinyi Station, it was already fully loaded. However, according to forecasts, there were still wooden plows and plowshares urgently needing to be loaded at the stations ahead, especially with Xinyi Station needing to temporarily load four head of cattle.... What to do? The team leader, Communist Party member Zhang Shaoqing, immediately convened a meeting of all team members to discuss solutions. He said: "We must do everything possible to transport agricultural support materials in a timely manner." Everyone said in unison: "Yes! We will do it no matter how difficult it is." As they spoke, everyone began to work together, temporarily transforming the car used for office work and rest, overturning the berths, moving the desks, and freeing up a large area. They also moved goods from other cars into this car. The cattle were loaded onto the train, and the wooden plows and plowshares were also loaded. They transported twelve tons more agricultural support materials than originally planned.
    Everyone brilliantly completed the first run of the Third Five-Year Plan, and they felt indescribably happy. At this moment, although the weather was cold, their red heart, burning like a raging fire to drive the train for the revolution, had long since filled the train with the atmosphere of spring.

    迎春列车
    济南铁路局  韦伟
    车轮滚滚，汽笛声声，一列迎春列车，在辽阔的原野上驰行。它是从连云港出发，开往徐州的支农快零列车。担任乘务的是先进集体，徐州列车段705／6次快零货运小组的同志们。在一辆棚车里，青年货运员范德成同志，正汗流浃背，脚下踏着厚厚的牛粪，紧张地打扫着。
    原来，列车在连云港站编组出发时，因车辆不够，就临时把这辆刚卸过牛的棚车挂上了。站上想派人清扫，已来不及了。不挂吧，少一辆车，沿途要少装多少支农物资啊；挂上吧，按照规定没清扫消毒，是不准使用的。这时，范德成想起了，他们小组出乘前，学习了《人民日报》元旦社论。大家决心要以新的战斗姿态，为实现第三个五年计划，创造良好的开端。他就主动向组长提出建议：上车清扫，然后再装运一些耐脏的物资。没等别人说话，就抢先上了车。难闻的气味，飞溅满身的粪便，汗水湿透了衣衫……这一些，范德成全不顾。他一心想的只是：尽早地把粪便清扫干净，争取早一站就装上货物，为支援农业夺得丰收贡献一份力量。
    列车在新沂站开车前，已经满载了。可是根据预报，前面几站还有木犁，犁铧面急待装运，特别是新沂站临时要装四头牛……。怎么办？组长、共产党员张绍清，马上召集全组人员商讨解决的办法。他说：“我们要千方百计地把支农物资及时运走。”大家异口同声说：“对！再难咱也要干。”说着，大家便一齐动手，把办公和休息的一辆车，临时改造起来，把床位掀了，把办公桌挪了，腾出了一大片地方来，又把别的车厢的货物，移到这个车厢来。牛装上了车，木犁和犁铧面也装上了。比原计划多运了十二吨支农物资。
    大家出色地完成了第三个五年计划的第一趟乘务，心里有说不出来的高兴。此刻，虽然天寒地冷，但他们那颗为革命跑车的烈火般的红心，却早已使列车春色洋溢了。
