    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 13th – The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on February 13th, severely condemning and strongly denouncing the bloody crime of American aircraft bombing the Huong Phuc School in Huong Khe District, Ha Tinh Province, on February 9th, killing and injuring fifty-seven students under the age of fifteen and eight peaceful residents.

    The statement pointed out that the crime of American aircraft bombing Huong Phuc School was not an isolated action. For more than a year, U.S. imperialism has used aircraft to attack many densely populated areas in North Vietnam, even bombing hospitals, schools, marketplaces, and sluice gates. American robber pilots have destroyed more than one hundred and twenty schools at all levels, killing many students and teachers.

    The statement said that this mad bombing of Huong Phuc School by American aircraft proves that the desperate American aggressor bandits do not hesitate to adopt all barbaric means, including using bombs to massacre young children. This barbaric act of war by the United States once again exposes its extremely brutal and aggressive nature. It also shows that U.S. President Johnson's recent clamoring for "peace" and "humanity" at the Honolulu Conference was merely a means to cover up the U.S. plot to strengthen and expand its war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The statement said that the Vietnamese people are determined to make American war criminals pay their blood debt. No matter how mad and brutal U.S. imperialism is, it cannot escape its shameful defeat in South Vietnam.

    The statement said that the entire Vietnamese people, with the sympathy and strong support of the people of the world, including the American people, are determined to defeat the American aggressors in order to defend their children, defend the sacred independence and sovereignty of their motherland, and contribute to defending peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 13th – Educators, students, and medical workers in various parts of North Vietnam have held rallies in recent days to angrily denounce the monstrous crime of American bandit aircraft barbarously bombing Huong Phuc School in Ha Tinh Province on February 9th, killing and injuring fifty-seven students.

    On February 11th and 12th, many schools in Hanoi held accusation meetings. More than two hundred educators and medical workers in Tu Liem District, a suburb of Hanoi, also held a rally to denounce this bloody crime of U.S. imperialism.

    At the same time, many students and educators in Haiphong, Nam Dinh, and Ha Duong, Hung Yen, Ninh Binh, Quang Ninh provinces also held denunciation rallies. The teachers and students of various schools, filled with deep hatred for U.S. imperialism, unanimously expressed that they would resolutely fight to the end for the cause of resisting America and saving the nation, and demand payment of the blood debt from the American aggressor bandits!

    越外交部发表声明抗议美机轰炸北方学校炸死炸伤六十五人
    越南人民一定要美国战争罪犯偿还血债
    新华社河内十三日电　越南民主共和国外交部十三日发表声明，严厉谴责和强烈控诉美国飞机九日轰炸河静省香溪县香福学校，炸死、炸伤五十七名十五岁以下的学生和八名和平居民的血腥罪行。
    声明指出，美国飞机轰炸香福学校的罪行，并不是一件孤立的行动。一年多以来，美帝国主义用飞机袭击了越南北方许多居民集中区，连医院、学校、市集和水闸都遭到了轰炸。美国强盗飞行员炸毁了一百二十多所各级学校，炸死了许多学生和教师。
    声明说，美国飞机这次疯狂轰炸香福学校的事件证明：穷途末路的美国侵略强盗，不惜采取一切野蛮手段，包括用炸弹来残杀年幼的孩子。美国这一野蛮的战争行动再一次暴露了它的极其残暴的侵略本性。这也表明美国总统约翰逊最近在檀香山会议上叫嚷“和平”和“人道”，只不过是为了掩盖美国加强和扩大侵略越南战争的阴谋而采取的手段而已。
    声明说，越南人民坚决要美国战争罪犯偿还血债。美帝国主义不论多么疯狂和残暴，也逃脱不了它在越南南方的可耻失败。
    声明说，全体越南人民，在包括美国人民在内的世界人民的同情和大力支持下，决心打败美国侵略者，以保卫自己的子弟，保卫祖国神圣的独立和主权，为保卫印度支那和东南亚的和平作出贡献。
    新华社河内十三日电　越南北方各地的教育工作者、学生和医务工作者，连日来纷纷举行集会，愤怒声讨美国强盗飞机九日野蛮轰炸河静省香福学校，炸死、炸伤五十七名学生的滔天罪行。
    十一日和十二日，河内市许多学校都举行了控诉大会。河内市郊慈廉县的教育工作者和医务工作者二百多人，也举行了集会，声讨美帝国主义的这一血腥罪行。
    同时，海防市、南定市和海阳、兴安、宁平、广宁等省的许多学生和教育工作者也都举行了声讨集会。各个学校的师生怀着对美帝国主义的深仇大恨一致表示：要坚决为抗美救国而战斗到底，向美国侵略强盗讨还血债！
