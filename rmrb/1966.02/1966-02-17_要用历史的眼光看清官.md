    To Understand Honest Officials with a Historical Perspective
    Xu Zhaoqing
    Summary: “Honest officials” were supported by the people at the time and did things for the common people. They heavily struck the ruling factions of the feudal dynasties. Saying that "honest officials" could only benefit the rule of the landlord class equates political theory with unchanging mathematical formulas. Blindly applying things leads to dogmatic errors.
    Since the debate on the issue of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" began, people seem to have reached a conclusion that in feudal times, both "honest officials" and "good officials" could only be loyal to the supreme ruler. "Honest officials" and corrupt officials are essentially birds of a feather.
    This statement is, of course, absolutely true from a purely theoretical perspective. So, why are there still many people arguing endlessly? The reason is simple: political theory is different from mathematical formulas, and it is not absolutely unchangeable in certain situations. When applying the principles of Marxism-Leninism, one should consider the specific circumstances and not apply them blindly, otherwise one will commit the error of dogmatism. This is the fundamental difference between mechanical materialism and dialectical materialism. After understanding this crucial issue, let's talk about the concept of "honest officials" and "good officials."
    The terms "good" and "bad," like "fast" and "slow," are relative concepts. What was fast in the past may be slow now. Similarly, what was good in the past may be bad now. In the feudal dynasties, the people were better off not interacting with officials at all. If they had to interact, there were only two types of people: one was the corrupt officials who committed all kinds of evil, and the other was the so-called "honest officials" who "abided by the law." Needless to say, the vast majority of people liked the latter. Therefore, it is completely scientific and in line with the actual situation at the time to say that "honest officials" and "good officials" were supported by the people in the past.
    Of course, these "honest officials" and "good officials" are also problematic from today's perspective, because they are, after all, tools of the landlord class dictatorship and cannot serve the people. However, this does not equate to the people's thoughts at the time! If the vast majority of people did not love and support "honest officials," would they prefer the tyrannical and overbearing corrupt officials? Therefore, the issue of "good" and "bad" should primarily be determined based on the people's selection criteria at the time, and not solely based on our current political perspective.
    Some may say, since "honest officials" serve the landlord class, how can they stand on the side of the people? I think this statement is too arbitrary. We only need to think that China is a vast country with a large population and a long history, so what's so strange about producing a few fools like Bao Gong and Hai Rui who specialize in contradicting their superiors and doing things for the common people? Let's talk about the current situation: some officials working in reactionary regimes, because they cannot stand the reckless behavior of their superiors, are motivated by righteous indignation and do some things that are beneficial to the people. This is not impossible.
    Some may say that kneeling down to "honest officials" to file complaints is not the solution. Only by participating in armed struggle, launching peasant revolution, and smashing the feudal system can there be a real way out. These words sound very beautiful at first, but they are worth studying. First, the issue of the peasant's way out is completely different from the concept of "good" and "bad" officials. Second, Comrade Lu Yu said it very well, "Without asking about the various complex conditions at the time, telling all the peasants to participate in armed struggle is probably not in line with the actual situation" ("Is there no positive significance in 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'?", "People's Daily," January 19 this year). Moreover, peasants did not usually go to the yamen [government office]. If they wanted to see an official, it must be because there was an important matter that urgently needed to be resolved. Now, to lightly tell them to launch a peasant revolution, regardless of whether it succeeds or not, is like trying to quench a raging fire with a distant water source. Moreover, the peasant armies at that time could not have received any Marxist-Leninist education and lacked correct ideological leadership. Even if the revolution was successful, the old dynasty was overthrown, the new regime would still be a feudal dynasty, and the landlord class would still rule over the vast majority of people. Would the new regime be better? Absolutely not. The tiger on the east mountain eats people, and the tiger on the west mountain also eats people. What I mean is not that the peasants in the past should not have struggled, but the fact is that throughout the history from the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors to the end of the reign of Emperor Xuantong, although there were hundreds or even thousands of uprisings of various sizes, in the end, one dynasty replaced another. This is an ironclad fact that cannot be overthrown no matter how you argue.
    Some may also say that "honest officials" and "good officials" can confuse the masses, weaken the people's fighting spirit, reconcile class contradictions, and play a role in consolidating the ruling position of the feudal dynasty. Therefore, they should be severely criticized. I think this statement is worth discussing. I completely agree with Comrade Lu Yu's statement: "If Hai Rui should be blamed for such a crime, then the corrupt officials, powerful families, and magnates should be praised instead. They will not 'redress grievances' for the people, nor will they engage in 'returning land.' They will not do a single good thing for the people, but only do bad things. Then they will awaken the people's fighting spirit and play a role in weakening the Ming Dynasty regime. In this way, wouldn't they become great heroes in history?" Isn't this the biggest joke in the world? Moreover, in the long history of China, it would not be appropriate if all parts of the country were full of corrupt officials, powerful families, and magnates. For the vast majority of people, is this more beneficial or more harmful? Even if the people struggle every day, have uprisings every month, and change dynasties every year, it will not be much better. We only need to look at the so-called chaotic Five Dynasties period, when people wandered everywhere, families were separated, and there was no talk of living and working in peace. The situation of the vast majority of people was not better, but worse. Let me emphasize again that I am not saying that the peasants in the past should not have revolted. The fact is that the vast majority of China's historical periods occurred before the birth of Marx and Lenin. At that time, there could not have been Marxist-Leninist theories, and most of the peasants were illiterate. Due to the lack of correct guiding ideology, they could not escape the circle of feudal dynasties throughout the long historical period. As a result, the landlord class still benefited, and the peasants still suffered. Now, to tell the vast majority of people not to file complaints with "honest officials" but to have a thorough revolution to fight for freedom is just talk. Could it have been done thousands of years ago?
    As for saying that "honest officials" and "good officials" played a role in reconciling class contradictions, thereby consolidating the ruling position of the feudal dynasty, this is also dubious. Everyone knows that the targets of "honest officials" and "good officials" are precisely the large landlords such as powerful families and magnates. They are really the ruling faction of the feudal dynasty. Since they have been severely hit, how can it be said that the position of the feudal dynasty is instead more consolidated? Although Hai Rui returned the land of the large landlords to the small and medium landlords, after the powerful landlords of the ruling faction were severely hit, was the position of the entire landlord class instead more consolidated? Moreover, "honest officials" and "good officials" may sometimes do some beneficial things for the vast majority of people. Are the victims in unjust cases all small and medium landlords and small businessmen? Does building bridges, paving roads, and dredging rivers not have any benefits for the vast majority of people? Therefore, saying that the actions of "honest officials" and "good officials" can only benefit the landlord class and can only consolidate the ruling position of the landlord class is theoretically sound, but it does not hold up after checking with the actual situation.
    Based on the above analysis, I believe that "honest officials" and "good officials" existed objectively in history. We must not close our eyes and talk about theory! We should know that the basic spirit of Marxism-Leninism is to respect objective facts, otherwise it is subjective idealism!

    要用历史的眼光看清官
    徐肇庆
    提要　“清官”是当时人民拥护的，替老百姓办事的。他们沉重地打击了封建王朝的当权派。说“清官”只能有利于地主阶级的统治，这是把政治理论与不变的数学公式等同起来。生搬硬套会犯教条主义错误。
    自从《海瑞罢官》问题展开争辩以后，人们好象得出一个结论，就是在封建时代，“清官”、“好官”都只能效忠于最高统治者。“清官”也好，贪官也好，本质上是一丘之貉。
    这一番话从纯理论的角度来看，当然是千真万确的。那末，为什么还有很多人争论不休呢？理由很简单，政治上的理论跟数学上的公式不同，在某些场合不是绝对不变的。运用马克思列宁主义的原则时，应该斟酌具体情况，不能生搬硬套，否则就会犯教条主义的错误。机械唯物论和唯物辩证法的根本不同点就在这里。明了这一个关键性的问题以后，再来谈谈“清官”“好官”的概念吧。
    所谓“好坏”跟“快慢”一样，都是相对的概念。过去是快的，现在可能是慢的。同样，过去是好的，现在也可能是坏的。在封建王朝时代，人民不接触官员也罢了，假使非接触不可时，那末只有两类人物：一种是无恶不作的贪官污吏，还有一种是“奉公守法”的所谓“清官”。广大人民喜欢的，不用说是后一种。因此说“清官”、“好官”受到过去人民的拥护，这完全是科学的、符合当时实际情况的。
    当然，这种“清官”、“好官”在目前看来，也成问题了，因为他们毕竟是地主阶级专政的工具，不可能为人民服务。不过，这并不等于当时人民的想法呀！假使广大人民不爱戴“清官”的话，那末他们倒会喜欢强凶霸道的贪官污吏吗？因此“好坏”问题，主要应该拿当时人民的选择标准来作决定，不能单凭我们目前的政治眼光来作判断。
    有人会说，“清官”既然为地主阶级服务，怎么会站在人民那一边呢？我认为这种说法未免太武断了。我们只要想一想，中国地大人多，历史又很悠久，出个把象包公、海瑞之类的傻瓜，专门跟上司顶撞，替老百姓办事，那有什么稀奇呢？就拿现在的情况来谈谈罢，有些在反动政权里工作的官员，因为看不惯上司的胡作非为，激于义愤，做了一些有利于人民的事情，也并不是不可能的。
    有人会说，向“清官”跪下来告状不是办法，只有参加武装斗争，发动农民革命，粉碎封建制度，才有真正的出路。这几句话，初听起来倒很漂亮，却是值得研究的。首先，农民的出路问题，跟官员的“好坏”概念，根本是两回事。其次，陆雨同志说得很对，“不问当时种种复杂的条件，叫所有的农民都参加武装斗争，这恐怕不合实际情况的吧”（《〈海瑞罢官〉没有积极意义吗？》，《人民日报》今年一月十九日）。何况农民平时是不上衙门的，要见官员，一定是有重要事情急于要解决，现在轻描淡写地叫他们发动农民革命，不论是否成功，毕竟是远水救不了近火的。况且那时候的农民军队，根本不可能接受过什么马克思列宁主义的教育，缺乏正确的思想领导，最后即使革命成功，旧的王朝推翻，结果新的政权仍旧是一个封建王朝，地主阶级依然统治着广大人民。新的政权是否好一些呢？绝对不会。东山老虎吃人，西山老虎也是吃人的。我这一番话并不是说，过去的农民不应该去斗争，只不过一部历史从三皇五帝一直到宣统末年，尽管大小起义事件有数百起，甚至数千起，但是搞来搞去，不过是这个王朝替代另一个王朝罢了。这是铁一般的事实，任你怎样争辩，也是无法推翻的。
    有人又说，“清官”、“好官”能够迷惑群众，削弱人民斗志，调和阶级矛盾，起了巩固封建王朝统治地位的作用，因此，应该严厉批判。我认为这种说法是值得商榷的。我完全同意陆雨同志的说法：“假使海瑞该受到这样的罪名的话，那末，那班贪官污吏豪门权贵之流反而值得表扬了。他们不会替百姓‘平冤狱’，也不会搞‘退田’，不会替老百姓做一件好事，只能做坏事，那他们倒唤醒了农民的斗志，起着削弱明朝政权的作用，这样，他们岂不是成了历史上的大功臣吗？”这岂不是天大的笑话吗？何况在漫长的中国历史上，假使全国各地都是一批贪官污吏、豪门权贵之类，那也不成体统了。对于广大人民来说，这竟是利多害少呢，还是害多利少呢？即使人民天天斗争，月月起义，年年换朝代，也是好不了多少的。我们只要看一看历史上的所谓乱五代，那时候人民流浪各处，妻离子散，谈不上什么安居乐业。广大人民的情况不是好一些，反而是坏一些了。让我再来强调一下，我这一番话并不是叫过去的农民不要去革命，事实是我国极大部分的历史时期是发生在马克思列宁诞生以前的。那时候根本不可能有马克思列宁主义的学说，农民群众又大多数是不识字的，由于缺乏正确的指导思想，所以他们在漫长的历史时期里，搞来搞去，始终跳不出封建王朝这个圈子。结果占便宜的还是地主阶级，吃亏的还是农民群众。现在叫广大人民不去向“清官”告状，却要来一个彻底革命，去争取自由，这不过是说说罢了，在千百年以前，难道做得到吗？
    至于说“清官”、“好官”起了调和阶级矛盾的作用，从而巩固了封建王朝的统治地位，这也是似是而非的。谁都知道“清官”、“好官”打击的对象，正是豪门权贵之类的大地主。他们实在是封建王朝的当权派。他们既然受到了沉重的打击，怎么可以说封建王朝的地位，反而来得巩固些呢？海瑞虽然把大地主的田地退还给中小地主，但是当权派的大地主受到沉重打击以后，整个地主阶级的地位，难道反而来得巩固吗？还有“清官”、“好官”对于广大人民，有时候也可能做出一些有利的事情来。冤狱案件中的受害人，难道都是一些中小地主和小商人吗？修桥铺路开河，难道对于广大人民一点好处也没有吗？因此，说“清官”、“好官”的所作所为，只能有利于地主阶级，只能巩固地主阶级的统治地位，在理论上是讲得通的，但跟实际情况核对以后，就站不住脚了。
    根据以上种种分析，我认为“清官”、“好官”在历史上，是客观存在的。我们千万不能闭着眼睛，空谈理论呀！应该知道，马克思列宁主义的基本精神，就是尊重客观事实，否则就是主观唯心论呀！
