Edition: 6

    From the South Vietnam, Central South Region Liberation Performing Arts Troupe:
    From the anti-American, nation-saving frontlines, from the trenches filled with the smoke of battle, all of us in the troupe extend our warmest greetings to our comrades in Beijing who are engaged in artistic work, and we eagerly await your letters. Dear comrades of Beijing Radio:
    Please convey our warmest and most sincere greetings to comrades in all Chinese performing arts troupes, theaters, art academies, and especially to the relevant units involved in creating and performing artistic programs supporting Vietnam in resisting America!
    Comrades, my name is Ruan Chunshan, and I am a dancer in the performing arts troupe of the People's Armed Forces in the Central South Region of South Vietnam. I have listened many times to the Beijing artistic circles' programs broadcast by your station, which support Vietnam in resisting America. Comrades, every word, every piece of music broadcast from Beijing is so moving, so blood-stirring. It urges me to pick up my pen and write this letter to you, to my Chinese comrades-in-arms fighting on the artistic front.
    Comrades, we just returned from the frontlines last night and are temporarily staying in a forest. The actor comrades, after several days of intense performances at the front, are now all deep in sweet dreams. Only one female comrade is still listening to the radio. She suddenly shouted, "Comrades, get up and listen! Beijing Radio is broadcasting a special artistic program supporting us!" So, all twenty-some of us got up and gathered around a small radio. At this time, gunfire and artillery sounds constantly came from the distant positions, sometimes even drowning out the sound of the radio, but your songs still flew across borders from thousands of miles away to reach us, encouraging our determination to resist American imperialism. At this moment, we were both excited and moved, and everyone's eyes were red, and some couldn't help but shed tears of emotion.
    Comrades, after listening to the broadcast, I lay down and thought a lot. The music and songs of the large-scale song and dance 《椰林怒火》("Coconut Grove of Anger") are indeed very good, but there is no way to see the dance part on the radio. How wonderful it would be to see it with my own eyes! There are also 《英雄姐妹》("Heroic Sisters"), the radio play 《仇恨的火焰》("Flames of Hatred"), 《南方来信》("Letter from the South"), Ping opera 《南方烈火》("Southern烈火 Fierce Fire"), and so on. How I wish I could sprout wings and fly to your side to see your performances! But, I know that this wish cannot be realized all at once. The most practical thing is that we must work harder, eliminate more American devils, drive them out of our country, and achieve the unification of our motherland. When that time comes, we will invite you to visit and perform in the cities of the Central South Region of South Vietnam, to fulfill our hopes!
    Dear comrades, now let me tell you about some of our activities. Once, we received an order from the People's Armed Forces Command to draw us from the frontlines, from the guerrillas in the "strategic hamlets," from the production front, and from the artistic ranks to form a performing arts troupe of the military region. We, who were used to handling guns, now have to play musical instruments, which is really difficult! After ideological struggle and mutual help among comrades, we clarified:
      "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind on it;
    To move mountains and reclaim the seas, perseverance achieves everything."
    This is what Uncle Ho taught our people. Listening to Uncle Ho's words, we put all our revolutionary enthusiasm into our work. We eat rice mixed with wild vegetables, use salt to eat with rice, and drink water from small rivers. But, we are all very happy and optimistic because we fully recognize that our revolutionary ranks are still very poor, and we must work hard to achieve victory. In nearly a month, we rehearsed twice as many artistic programs as originally planned. As soon as we performed a few times, the news spread throughout the battlefield, and various fronts sent letters and telegrams, asking us to perform for them. The troops and villagers in the newly liberated areas are looking forward to us day and night. Later, we formed groups of three or four people and went to the battlefield to perform while rehearsing programs. We often performed for the soldiers before they set off to attack the enemy. As soon as the performance was over, we set off with them to occupy the positions. Sometimes, while waiting for orders, we continued to perform artistic programs for the troops in the trenches. When the signal flare went up, we became members of the battle, picking up guns and charging towards the enemy's bunkers. After the battle, we began to publicize the National Liberation Front's line and policies to the local villagers. At night, the troops were on guard all around, and our performing arts troupe performed in the newly liberated areas. In our South Vietnam, children are the most fond of the little audience of art and literature, wherever we go, they follow us, and always pester us to teach them to sing.
    Later, we heard the villagers say something that made us laugh. After the enemy arrived in this village, they forced the children and the elderly to gather around several American advisors, with the aim of preventing these Americans from being shot by guerrillas. The puppet provincial governor, seeing that everyone was unwilling, said to the children, "Cheer for the American gentlemen, and I will give you candy." But the children shouted, "Down with American imperialism!" The stupid Americans were still very proud and distributed candy to the children. The old people quietly signaled the children not to take the American candy. Then, these children sang "American imperialism get out!" The puppet provincial governor looked at this scene but could do nothing, and could only pretend to be foolish to please his American masters. Soon, when we re-liberated this place, we saw a "team" coming from afar. The children in front were blowing trumpets of victory, and the children behind were disguised as American prisoners. They used black smoke from the bottom of the pot to blacken the area around their mouths, pasted white paper on the bridge of their noses, wore a few corn silks on their heads, their hands were tied, and behind them was a child holding a carbine. This gun was stolen from the enemy by these brave and resourceful children. The last group of children were arranged in three columns, and they sang "Liberate the South" as they walked. This group of children stopped in front of us, a most active rascal, with a wooden pistol hanging on his body, stood at attention and reported to us: "Our battalion has captured three enemy strongholds, liberated one hundred 'strategic hamlets,' caught three American devils and puppet military officers, and seized a cannon, all of which we handed over to the Liberation Army uncles." A cadre standing next to me said, "Welcome, welcome, the children are young, but they know how to do great things, cooperating with the uncles to fight American devils, they are really capable." After he finished speaking, he pointed to the carbine brought by the children and said, "Is it to be handed over to the uncles?" The children answered in unison: "Give it to the uncles!" A child added: "It's deposited, not given." "You don't know, I'm going to be a soldier in the Liberation Army! It should be issued to me then!"
    Dear comrades, the stories of the masses killing the enemy cannot be finished. I will continue to write in the next letter, and I hope to receive your reply. Your letters are an encouragement to me and the companions around me. Writing here, I read the letter to my companions, some said: "Please convey our greetings!" Some said: "Please extend our greetings to the sisters!" Some suggested that the radio comrades give a detailed introduction to the recent performances of some literary and artistic programs, and some asked to introduce the situation of dance schools, music academies, and performing arts troupes. There are many, many more opinions, and I really cannot satisfy all their requests, so I have to combine all the requests into the following paragraph: "All members of the South Vietnam Central South Region Liberation Performing Arts Troupe extend our warmest greetings to the comrades in Beijing who are engaged in literary and artistic work from the anti-American and national salvation front and the trenches filled with gunpowder, and we eagerly look forward to receiving your letters."
              With victorious greetings,
            Ruan Chunshan

### 从越南南方寄来的信

专栏：革命书信

    从越南南方寄来的信
    我们越南南方中部南区解放文工团全体团员从抗美救国最前线，从硝烟弥漫的战壕中，向北京从事文艺工作的同志们表示最亲切的敬意，并且殷切地盼望你们的来信。亲爱的北京电台的同志们：
    请你们代我向中国各个文工团、剧院、艺术学院的同志们，特别是参加创作、演出援越抗美文艺节目的有关单位致以最热烈、最诚挚的问候！
    同志们，我叫阮春山，是越南南方中部南区人民武装力量文工团里的一个舞蹈演员。我曾经好多次收听你们广播的北京文艺界创作和演出的援越抗美节目。同志们，从北京传出的每一句话、每一首乐曲，都是那么令人感动，令人浑身热血沸腾。它催促着我拿起笔来给你们，给在文艺战线上战斗着的中国战友们写这封信。
    同志们，昨天晚上我们刚刚从前线回来，暂时住在一片丛林里。演员同志们经过几天来在前线的紧张演出之后，现在都进入甜蜜的梦乡。只有一个女演员同志还在收听广播，她突然叫起来：“同志们，快起来听啊！北京电台正在播送支持我们的特别文艺节目哪！”于是，我们二十几个人全起来了，围着一个小小的收音机。这时候，从远处的阵地上不断传来枪炮声，有时候甚至淹没了收音机的声音，但是你们的歌声还是从万里之外，飞越国界传到了我们身边，它鼓舞着我们抗击美帝国主义的决心。这时候，我们的心情是又兴奋又激动，每个人的眼圈都红了，有的禁不住流出了感动的眼泪。
    同志们，我听完了广播，躺下来想了很多很多。大型歌舞《椰林怒火》的音乐歌曲，的确很好，但是在收音机里没有办法看到舞蹈部分，如果能够亲眼看到该多好啊！还有《英雄姐妹》、广播剧《仇恨的火焰》、《南方来信》、评剧《南方烈火》等等。我多么希望能够插上翅膀飞到你们身边，看看你们的演出！但是，我知道这个希望一下子还不能实现。最实际的还是，我们要加倍地工作，消灭更多的美国鬼子，把他们赶出我们的国土，实现祖国的统一。到那时候啊，我们将请你们到我们越南南方中部南区的城市来参观和演出，满足我们的希望！
    亲爱的同志们，现在让我向你们谈谈我们的一些活动情况。有一次，我们得到人民武装力量指挥部的命令，把我们这些人分别从前线、从“战略村”里的游击队、从生产战线上、从文艺队伍里抽调出来，组成军区的一个文工团。我们这些拿惯枪的手，现在要来弹乐器，真是困难啊！经过思想斗争和同志间的相互帮助之后，我们明确了：
      “世上无难事，只怕心不坚，
    移山与填海，有志事竟成。”
    这就是胡伯伯对我们人民的教导。听胡伯伯的话，我们拿出全部的革命热情去工作。我们吃的是米饭掺野菜，用盐巴下饭，喝的是小河里的流水。但是，我们都很愉快，很乐观，因为我们充分认识到我们的革命队伍还很穷，我们还要艰苦奋斗才能取得胜利。在将近一个月的时间里，我们排练了比原订计划多一倍的文艺节目。刚刚演出几次，消息就在整个战场上传开了，各个战线纷纷来信和来电报，要求我们到他们那里去演出，部队和新解放区的乡亲们正在日夜盼望我们。后来，我们三、四个人编成一组，分头到战场上去一边演出，一边排练节目。我们经常是在部队出发打击敌人以前给战士们演出的，演出一完，我们又和他们一道出发去占领阵地。有时候，我们一面等待命令，一面继续在战壕里给部队表演文艺节目。当信号弹一升起，我们就成为战斗的一员，拿起枪冲向敌人碉堡。战斗结束以后，我们又开始向当地乡亲宣传民族解放阵线的路线和政策，晚上，部队在四周警戒，我们文工团就在新解放的地区进行演出。在我们越南南方，孩子们是最喜爱文艺的小观众，我们到哪儿，他们就跟到哪儿，而且老是缠着我们教唱歌。
    后来，我们听乡亲们说了一件事，真叫人乐坏了。敌人到了这个村子以后，强迫小孩和老人集中起来，坐在几个美国顾问的周围，目的是为了让这些美国佬不挨游击队的枪弹。伪省长见大家不乐意，他就对孩子们说：“你们向美国先生欢呼吧，我给你们糖果吃”，孩子们却高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”愚蠢的美国佬还很得意，拿糖果分给孩子们。老人们悄悄地向孩子们示意，要他们不拿美国佬的糖。接着，这些孩子又高唱“美帝国主义滚出去！”伪省长看着这个场面却毫无办法，只好装傻讨好他的美国主子。不久，当我们重新解放这个地方的时候，看到从远处走来一支“队伍”，走在前头的几个孩子吹着凯旋归来的号角，跟在后面的几个大孩子化装成美国俘虏，他们用锅底的黑烟把嘴巴四周涂黑，用白纸贴在鼻梁上，头上戴着几把玉米须，双手被捆住，跟在后面的是一个手拿卡宾枪的孩子。这支枪是这些勇敢机智的孩子从敌人那里偷来的。走在最后面的一群大孩子排成三路纵队，他们边走边唱“解放南方”。这群孩子走到我们面前就停了下来，一个最活跃的小鬼，身上挂着一支木头手枪，向我们立正报告说：“我们这个营已经攻下了敌人三个据点，解放一百个
  ‘战略村’，逮住了三个美国鬼子和伪军军官，缴获一门大炮，我们都交给解放军叔叔。”站在我身边的一位干部说：“欢迎，欢迎，小朋友们年纪小，但是懂得干大事，配合叔叔们打美国鬼子，真能干。”说完他指着这群小孩带来的那支卡宾枪说：“是交给叔叔的吧？”小朋友们异口同声回答：“送给叔叔的！”一个小朋友补充了一句说：“是寄存，不是送。”“你不知道，我就要当上解放军了！那时候就该发给我啦！”
    亲爱的同志们，群众杀敌的故事是写不完的，下一封信我将继续写，希望能收到你们的回信。你们的来信对我和周围的同伴都是一种鼓舞。写到这儿，我把信读给同伴们听，他们有的说：“请代转达我们的问候！”有的说：“请代向姐姐们致意！”有的建议电台同志详细介绍最近公演的一些文艺节目的情况，还有的要求介绍舞蹈学校、音乐学院的情况和文工团的情况。还有许多许多意见，我真无法一一满足他们的请求，只好把所有的要求综合成以下的一段话：“我们越南南方中部南区解放文工团全体团员从抗美救国最前线，从硝烟弥漫的战壕中，向北京从事文艺工作的同志们表示最亲切的敬意，并且殷切地盼望你们的来信。”
              此　致必胜的敬礼
            阮春山
  一九六五年五月九号
