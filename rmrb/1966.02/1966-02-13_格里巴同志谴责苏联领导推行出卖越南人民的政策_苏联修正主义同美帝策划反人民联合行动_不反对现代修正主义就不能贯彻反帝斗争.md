    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th Dispatch from Brussels: The Belgian Communist Party's organ, the weekly *The Voice of the People,* published on December 31, 1965, a speech by the Secretary of the Belgian Communist Party, Comrade Griba, delivered at the Free University of Brussels, entitled "U.S. Imperialism Inherits Hitler's Mantle: The United and Fighting Peoples of the World Are Defeating It More and More." In his speech, Comrade Griba pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the main force of aggression and war in the world today and the number one enemy of the people of all countries. Soviet revisionism is conspiring with U.S. imperialism in anti-people joint actions. However, the vigorously rising anti-American struggle of the people around the world is increasingly exposing the paper tiger nature of U.S. imperialism.

    He said: "U.S. imperialism attempts to dominate the world: this was the aim of Hitler's German imperialism.

    "U.S. imperialism, emulating past Hitlerism, now pursues the most vicious anti-communism and attempts to destroy the socialist countries.

    "Its present actual and concrete aim is to enslave the people and countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for its own benefit, subjecting them to the rule of neo-colonialism and old colonialism.

    "U.S. imperialism, like Hitler's Germany, wants to maintain its control, hegemony, and domination over other capitalist countries, including its 'allies'.

    "U.S. imperialists, like Hitlerites, practice the most savage racism.

    "Today's U.S. imperialism, like past Hitlerism, is the main force of aggression and war in the world.

    "U.S. imperialism has indeed inherited Hitler's mantle and, in terms of the number of crimes it has committed and the degree of its cruelty, has surpassed its predecessor."

    Griba pointed out: "U.S. imperialism mainly implements its plan to dominate the world through its set of militarism and military aggression policies." He then enumerated the various crimes of the United States in establishing military bases around the world, plotting criminal activities, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, supporting traitorous regimes, and even openly launching aggression.

    He said, "U.S. imperialism attempts to dominate the world. Therefore, what it does internationally is not only to intensify the neo-colonialist and old colonialist exploitation and oppression of the people and countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and wage criminal wars against the people of these countries, ... but also all industrialized capitalist countries are targets it has set its sights on."

    He said: "Imperialism, headed by U.S. imperialism, regards Asia, Africa, and Latin America as its backyard of interests, carrying out super-exploitation of the people of these countries."

    "At the same time, U.S. imperialism believes that other imperialist countries, including its allies, should also become its second backyard."

    He said: "Due to the impact of the victory of national liberation revolutionary movements and the victory of socialist revolutions, and also due to the aggression, control, interference, and bullying of U.S. imperialism, the contradictions between imperialism and between capitalism have sharpened and will inevitably become even sharper."

    Griba then emphatically pointed out the reactionary and counter-revolutionary role played by Khrushchev revisionism, which cooperates with U.S. imperialism, throughout the world. He said: "Revisionism is the product of the erosion of capitalist ideology and surrender to imperialism." "Khrushchevism, as the political representative of the new privileged class in the Soviet Union, cooperates with U.S. imperialism on an international scale. The systematization of Khrushchev revisionism produced the 'two alls, three peacefuls' 'theory'."

    "The Moscow Three-Nation Treaty on nuclear armaments by U.S. imperialism and its collaborator, the Khrushchev group, shamelessly showed that they vainly attempted to 'legalize' their monopoly of nuclear weapons and nuclear blackmail." But, "China's explosion of the atomic bomb broke the nuclear monopoly of the United States and revisionism."

    "'The hotline' is not only a symbol of the joint anti-people actions of the United States and the revisionists, but also a tool for Soviet revisionism and U.S. imperialism to conspire in anti-people joint actions.

    "The Khrushchev revisionist group has used the most despicable means to split and weaken the socialist camp by all means.

    "They coordinated with imperialism to blockade the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Albania; they unilaterally and rudely tore up all trade contracts and various agreements in order to create enormous difficulties for these two socialist countries, vainly hoping that these countries would submit to them."

    "The Khrushchev revisionist group practices great-power chauvinism and adopts neo-colonialist means of exploiting people and countries in its relations with socialist countries and other countries, which is particularly manifested in unequal trade relations.

    "The Khrushchev revisionist group supports the United Nations, a tool of U.S. imperialism, and its interference in the affairs of various countries. This situation is particularly evident in the Congo, where this group frequently betrayed the armed resistance struggle of the Congolese people.

    "The Khrushchev revisionist group also joined hands with U.S. imperialism to provide the Indian reactionary bourgeoisie with large quantities of modern weapons and aid, supporting its aggression against the People's Republic of China, Pakistan, and Kashmir.

    "They even, in agreement with the United States, proposed the establishment of an international gendarmerie, which they called 'peacekeeping forces,' to suppress the people of all countries."

    Griba especially condemned the Khrushchev revisionists for serving U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue, betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people. He said: "They have adopted a policy towards the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people that is completely in line with Washington's wishes. Khrushchev used to openly oppose the struggle of the Vietnamese people, while his former colleagues and current successors today say they want to help the Vietnamese people. However, this 'aid' is far from sufficient and far less than the aid that the Soviet Union gives to the Indian reactionary bourgeoisie. This aid is often outdated and unusable materials. The purpose of this new method of the Khrushchev revisionist group is to intervene more insidiously in the affairs of the Vietnamese people in order to further betray them. The Khrushchev revisionists are also attempting to create an excuse to directly or through their followers launch propaganda activities that are in fact against the Vietnamese people, advocating the 'negotiations' desired by Johnson, in order to allow U.S. imperialism, which has already fallen into a desperate situation, to impose its rule on Southeast Asia."

    Griba also condemned the Khrushchev revisionists for attempting to split the international communist movement. He said: "The Khrushchev revisionist group is constantly exacerbating the split in the international communist movement; they attack and slander Marxist-Leninist parties, especially the Communist Party of China and the Albanian Party of Labour. They attack and carry out factional activities to strike at the Communist Party of Indonesia, the Communist Party of Japan, the Communist Party of New Zealand, and the Communist Party of Australia. The Soviet Khrushchev revisionist group fully supports revisionist splittist factions in the communist parties and workers' parties of various countries, and has played a fundamental role in the degeneration of some communist parties."

    He said that after Khrushchev's downfall, "Khrushchev's successors are implementing Khrushchevism one hundred percent without Khrushchev. The only difference between them and Khrushchev is that they are more insidious and cunning. Therefore, they are even more dangerous. Their hypocritical and loudly shouted 'unity' is a unity of betrayal based on their position, a unity with U.S. imperialism."

    Griba thus concluded: "Khrushchev revisionism is thoroughly counter-revolutionary and reactionary. Khrushchev revisionism is cooperation with U.S. imperialism. Khrushchev revisionism is the political pillar of imperialism. We want to reiterate once again: Without a fierce struggle to expose, isolate, and eliminate ... neo-reformism, namely Khrushchev revisionism, the anti-imperialist struggle cannot be carried out consistently."

    Griba finally pointed out that despite having Khrushchev revisionism serving it, "U.S. imperialism is a colossus with feet of clay, and the people will eventually bury it." He said: "The strength of U.S. imperialism is actually unstable and fragile because it is built on the exploitation and oppression of the vast majority of the world's people. ... U.S. imperialism, which is hostile to ninety percent of the world's people and only represents a small number of financial oligarchs and maintains their interests, is destined to ultimately fail completely."

    格里巴同志谴责苏联领导推行出卖越南人民的政策
    苏联修正主义同美帝策划反人民联合行动
    不反对现代修正主义就不能贯彻反帝斗争
    新华社十二日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：比利时共产党机关报《人民之声》周刊一九六五年十二月三十一日发表了比利时共产党书记格里巴在布鲁塞尔私立大学所发表的讲话，题为《美帝国主义继承了希特勒的衣钵　团结战斗的世界各国人民使它遭到越来越大的失败》。格里巴在讲话中指出，美帝国主义是今天世界上侵略和战争的主要力量，是世界各国人民的头号敌人。苏联修正主义正在同美帝国主义一道，策划反人民的联合行动。但是，全世界人民蓬勃高涨的反美斗争，正使美帝国主义的纸老虎本质日益暴露。
    他说：“美帝国主义企图统治世界：这曾经是希特勒德国帝国主义的目的。
    “美帝国主义效法过去的希特勒主义，现在奉行最凶恶的反共主义，并且企图摧毁各社会主义国家。
    “它现在实际的和具体的企图，是为了自己的利益奴役亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的各国人民和国家，使他们处于新老殖民主义的统治之下。
    “美帝国主义同希特勒德国一样，想保持它对其他资本主义国家，包括它的‘盟国’的控制、霸权和统治。
    “美帝国主义者象希特勒分子一样，实行最野蛮的种族主义。
    “今天的美帝国主义同过去的希特勒主义一样，是世界上侵略和战争的主要力量。
    “美帝国主义确实是继承了希特勒的衣钵，而且就其所犯罪行之多及其残酷程度来说，超过了它的前辈。”
    格里巴指出：“美帝国主义主要通过它的一套军国主义和军事侵略政策，继续执行它的统治世界的计划。”他接着历数了美国在全世界建立军事基地，策划罪恶活动，干涉别国内政，扶植卖国政权，直至公开发动侵略的种种罪行。
    他说，“美帝国主义企图统治世界。因此，它在国际上所干的，不仅是加强对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民和国家的新老殖民主义的剥削和压迫，对这些国家的人民进行罪恶战争，……而且，所有工业化的资本主义国家也是它看中的目标。”
    他说：“以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲看作它的利益的后院，对这些国家的人民进行超剥削。”
    “同时，美帝国主义认为包括它的盟国在内的其它的帝国主义国家，也应该成为它的第二后院。”
    他说：“由于民族解放革命运动的胜利和社会主义革命的胜利的冲击，也由于美帝国主义的侵略、控制、干涉和欺压，帝国主义之间以及资本主义之间的矛盾已经尖锐化并且必将更加尖锐化。”
    格里巴接着强调指出了同美帝国主义合作的赫鲁晓夫修正主义在全世界所起的反动作用和反革命作用。他说：“修正主义是资本主义意识形态侵蚀和对帝国主义投降的产物。”“作为苏联新特权阶级政治代表的赫鲁晓夫主义，在国际范围内同美帝国主义实行合作。赫鲁晓夫修正主义的系统化产生了‘两全、三和’的‘理论’。”
    “美帝国主义及其合作者赫鲁晓夫集团的关于核军备的莫斯科三国条约无耻地表明，他们妄想把自己垄断核武器和进行核讹诈‘合法化’。”但是，“中国爆炸原子弹打破了美国和修正主义的核垄断”。
    “‘热线’不仅是美国和修正主义者联合反人民的象征，而且是苏联修正主义和美帝国主义策划反人民的联合行动的工具。
    “赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团不择手段，使用了最卑鄙的手段来分裂和削弱社会主义阵营。
    “他们配合帝国主义，一起对中华人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国进行封锁；他们单方面地和粗暴地撕毁了全部贸易合同和各种协定，以便给这两个社会主义国家制造巨大困难，徒劳无益地指望这些国家向他们屈服。”
    “赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团实行大国沙文主义，在同社会主义各国以及其它国家的关系中，采用新殖民主义的、剥削人民和国家的手段，这特别表现在贸易的不平等关系中。
    “赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团支持美帝国主义的工具联合国及其对各国人民的干涉。这种情况在刚果表现得特别明显，这一集团经常叛卖刚果人民的武装反抗斗争。
    “赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团还联合美帝国主义给印度反动资产阶级以大量的现代化武器和援助，支持它侵略中华人民共和国、巴基斯坦和克什米尔。
    “他们甚至在同美国取得一致的情况下，建议建立一支他们称之为‘和平部队’的、镇压各国人民的国际宪兵队。”
    格里巴特别谴责赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在越南问题上为美帝国主义效劳，出卖越南人民的利益。他说：“他们对越南人民的英勇斗争采取一种完全符合华盛顿意愿的政策。赫鲁晓夫过去公开表示反对越南人民的斗争，而他过去的同事、现在的继承者今天则表示要援助越南人民。但是，这种‘援助’是非常不够的，远远少于苏联给印度反动资产阶级的援助。这种援助往往是陈旧不堪和不适用的物资。赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团这种新手法的目的，是更加阴险地插手越南人民的事务，以便进一步出卖他们。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者也还企图制造一种借口，来直接地或者通过他们的追随者掀起实际上是反对越南人民的宣传活动，鼓吹约翰逊所希望的‘谈判’，以便让已经陷入绝境的美帝国主义把它的统治强加于东南亚。”
    格里巴还谴责赫鲁晓夫修正主义企图分裂国际共产主义运动。他说：“赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团不断加剧国际共产主义运动的分裂；他们攻击和诽谤马克思列宁主义政党、特别是中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党。他们攻击并且进行分裂派别活动来打击印度尼西亚共产党，日本共产党，新西兰共产党和澳大利亚共产党。苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团全力支持各国共产党和工人党中的修正主义分裂派，在一些共产党的蜕变中起了根本性的作用。”
    他说，在赫鲁晓夫下台后，“赫鲁晓夫的继承者在没有赫鲁晓夫的情况下，百分之百地推行赫鲁晓夫主义。他们与赫鲁晓夫不同的只是更加阴险狡猾罢了。因此他们也更加危险。他们虚伪地大肆叫嚷的‘联合’，就是建立在他们的立场之上的背叛的联合，就是同美帝国主义的联合。”
    格里巴由此得出结论说：“赫鲁晓夫修正主义是彻底反革命和反动的。赫鲁晓夫修正主义就是同美帝国主义合作。赫鲁晓夫修正主义是帝国主义的政治支柱。我们要再一次重申：不进行揭露、孤立和清除……新改良主义即赫鲁晓夫修正主义的激烈斗争，就不能始终不渝地进行反帝斗争。”
    格里巴最后指出，尽管有赫鲁晓夫修正主义为它效劳，但是“美帝国主义是泥足巨人，人民终将埋葬它”。他说：“美帝国主义的力量实际上是不稳定和脆弱的，因为它建筑在对世界绝大多数人民的剥削和压迫之上。……敌视世界上百分之九十的人民、只是代表一小撮金融寡头和维护其利益的美帝国主义，注定最后要彻底失败。”
