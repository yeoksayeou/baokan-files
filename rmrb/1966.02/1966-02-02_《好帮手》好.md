    "Good Helper" is Good
    廖菁 (Liao Jing)
    After watching the excellent programs of the Southwest District Drama and Local Opera Performance: the one-act dialect drama "Good Helper," I was greatly educated. The play is well-written and well-performed. It is another gratifying achievement in the creation of one-act dramas.
    The script, through a small "broad bean leaf" incident and a ideological conflict between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law against the special privileges of cadres' families, reveals a very meaningful social problem. It powerfully criticizes the selfish mentality and the old consciousness of envying special treatment that exists in some cadres' families; exposes the ugly acts of capitalist habits and forces that take advantage of every opportunity to infiltrate and corrupt cadres; and praises the noble qualities of grassroots cadres and advanced cadres' families who resolutely safeguard the collective interests and maintain the true qualities of ordinary laborers. Although the play is small, it contains great significance, expressing a profound and highly generalized theme in a short space, elevating what seems to be an ordinary matter to the ideological height of preventing the erosion of capitalist ideas on the cadre ranks and ensuring that the ranks of poor and lower-middle peasants never change color.
    The mother of Zhang Guide, the deputy captain of the production team, has long believed that her son, as a cadre, goes to work ahead of everyone else, returns last, and his family has to take the lead in doing difficult work. He works hard for everyone, enduring hardship and taking risks, and delaying the family's work. Under the drive of this "suffering loss" mentality, the privileged thinking of the bourgeoisie and feudal classes takes advantage of the situation and gradually grows in her mind, thinking that cadres are entitled to some special "care" as a matter of course. In addition, Zhang Fugui, a wealthy peasant, seizes the opportunity to provoke and encourage her, so she privately picks some broad bean leaves from the collective for feed. Zhang Fugui then takes the opportunity to use "the cadre's family can pick them, so I can pick them too!" as a shield, and steals the team's broad beans. When her daughter-in-law, Li Qunfang, discovers that this "cadre's family" is her own mother-in-law, she immediately sees the serious consequences from a few broad bean leaves: cadres are servants of the people, and if cadres and their families seek special privileges, they will become detached from the masses and open the floodgates for capitalism. She unhesitatingly, with full enthusiasm and the class feeling of defending the poor and lower-middle peasants from ever changing color, patiently persuades and educates her mother-in-law, and firmly struggles against this ideological behavior that damages collective interests and corrupts the class consciousness of the poor and lower-middle peasants.
    Li Qunfang, an ordinary rural woman who, when she thinks of electrification in the mountains, wishes she could grow ten hands to do the work, is shaped very touchingly by the author's class-filled pen. She believes that "the day I pick up Chairman Mao's book, I will be able to recognize it from beginning to end," and that she is "the happiest person!" Her spirit of farming for the revolution, wholeheartedly towards the collective and the communist future, is very lofty and moving. She is a good example for people to emulate!
    Although the whole play has only four characters and the plot is relatively simple, the whole play is rich and colorful, novel and vivid, and the contradictions are revealed solidly, credibly, and appropriately. The demeanor of the new people in the countryside is vividly portrayed, full of flesh and blood, with strong characteristics of northern Sichuan. In its simplicity and plainness, it contains a serious theme that is worthy of careful consideration and thought-provoking.
    Why can the ideological depth and artistic appeal of this small play reach a higher level, and come from the hands of young amateur authors of a prefectural-level troupe? This cannot but arouse our deep thought. The comrades of the Rural Cultural Work Troupe of the Dazhou Prefecture in Sichuan Province, under the leadership of the CPC Dazhou Prefectural Committee, have consistently adhered to Chairman Mao's literary and art policy, serving socialist politics and serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, year after year, facing the vast rural areas of northern Sichuan, and enjoying a very high reputation among the peasant masses. The authors and actors are closely connected with the fiery struggle life and have close ties with the basic masses in the deep mountains. They are a comprehensive literary and artistic group that can perform music, dance, and drama, and have cultivated a large number of revolutionary new soldiers who can create, act, sing, and dance; can also work and do grassroots mass work in the mountains and rains of northern Sichuan. The writer of "Good Helper" is Chen Xiucheng, the young actress who plays Li Qunfang. Without a relatively solid foundation of life, without close ties with the masses, and without unremitting ideological transformation, such a "Good Helper" could not be written.
    The Rural Cultural Work Troupe of Dazhou Prefecture is constantly creating excellent programs. Their experience of adhering to political leadership, connecting with the masses, and connecting with life is worth our serious study.

### 《好帮手》好

    《好帮手》好
    廖菁
    看了西南区话剧、地方戏会演优秀剧目：独幕方言话剧《好帮手》，受到很大的教育。戏写得好，也演得好。是独幕话剧创作上又一个可喜的成就。
    剧本通过一个小小“胡豆叶”事件，婆媳间一场反对干部家属特殊化的思想冲突，揭示了一个很有意义的社会问题。有力地批判了有的干部家属存在的自私心理和羡慕特殊的旧意识；揭露了资本主义习惯势力见缝插针、腐蚀干部的丑恶行径；歌颂了坚决维护集体利益、永葆普通劳动者阶级本色的基层干部及先进干部家属的高贵品质。戏虽小，小中寓大，短短篇幅表现了一个深刻的、具有高度概括性的主题，把看来是一件普通的事，提到杜绝资本主义思想对干部队伍的侵蚀，保证贫下中农阶级队伍永不变色的思想高度。
    生产队副队长张贵德的母亲，长期认为儿子当干部，出工走前头，收工走后头，不好做的活还要家属带头；辛辛苦苦为大家办事，又受劳累、又担风险，还耽搁家里的活路，……在这种“吃亏”心理的驱使下，资产阶级和封建阶级的特权思想便乘虚而入，逐渐在头脑中滋长，自以为：干部嘛，多得点把子特殊“照顾”也在“情理”。加上富裕农民张富贵窥伺其隙，有意挑唆、怂恿，便私将集体的胡豆叶捋了点做饲料。张富贵呢，则乘机以“干部屋里头的人捋得，我也捋得！”作为护身符，竟偷窃队上的胡豆。当儿媳李群芳发现这个“干部屋里头的人”就是自己的婆婆时，立即从几片胡豆叶子上洞察到它的严重后果：干部是人民的勤务员，当干部的、当家属的闹特殊就会脱离群众，就会为资本主义打开泛滥的决口。她便毫不犹豫地、怀着满腔热情和捍卫贫下中农永不变色的阶级感情，对婆婆进行耐心的说服教育，对这种既损害集体利益又败坏贫下中农阶级意识的思想行为作了坚决斗争。
    李群芳，这个一想到山区电气化就恨不得自己能长出十双手来做活路的普通农村妇女，在作者饱含阶级感情的笔下，塑造得十分感人。这个自认为：“哪一天拿起毛主席他老人家的书，就能从头到尾认得完”，自己才是“最幸福的人！”一心向着集体，向着共产主义的未来，她那为革命而种田的精神境界是很高大而动人的。她是人们仿效的好榜样！
    全剧虽只四个人物，情节也较单纯，但整个戏却显得丰富多采，新颖生动，矛盾揭露得坚实可信、分寸适度。农村新人风貌刻划得栩栩如生、血肉丰满，带有浓郁的川北风土特色。在质朴平易中蕴蓄着耐人细品、发人深思的严肃主题。
    为什么这个小戏的思想深度及艺术感染力能达到较高的水平，而且出于专区一级剧团青年业余作者之手？这不能不引起我们的深思。四川省达县专区农村文工团的同志们，在中共达县地委的领导下，一贯坚持毛主席的文艺方针，为社会主义政治服务，为工农兵服务，上山下乡，十年如一日，面向川北广大农村，在农民群众中享有很高的声誉。作者和演员与炽热的斗争生活息息相通，与深山老峪的基本群众有着密切联系。他们是一个可以演出音乐、舞蹈、话剧的综合性文艺团体，而且在川北的山水风雨中，培养出大批既会创作、演戏、能歌善舞；又会劳动，又会做基层群众工作的革命化的文艺新军。《好帮手》的执笔者就是扮演李群芳的青年演员陈秀澄同志。如果没有比较雄厚的生活基础，没有跟群众的密切联系，没有坚持不懈的思想改造，是写不出这样的《好帮手》的。
    达县专区农村文工团不断地创作出一些优秀剧目，他们坚持政治挂帅，联系群众，联系生活的经验，值得我们认真学习。
