    According to a Yunnan Daily report, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee held an enlarged work conference in mid-January at the model site of the Baoshan Prefectural Party Committee. The conference called on all cadres throughout the province working in rural areas to emphasize politics, bring a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and a hoe to the forefront of production, fully mobilize the masses, boost agricultural production, and strive for a relatively large increase in production this year.

    The comrades attending the meeting viewed the model fields in the Baoshan area and listened to introductions about the experience of running model fields. They unanimously agreed that to run model plots well, it is necessary to combine the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, like Baoshan Prefecture, with class struggle as the key link, production as the center, and everything achieved through scientific experimentation. Production struggle and scientific experimentation are themselves revolutionary movements, and these two revolutionary movements are carried out in an environment of sharp class struggle. In the process of running model plots, it is necessary to firmly grasp class struggle at every step and emphasize politics in everything. Everyone drew a conclusion from Baoshan's experience: the most fundamental thing to run model plots well and improve production is to take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, emphasizing politics every step of the way and emphasizing politics in everything.

    After summarizing and exchanging experiences in running model fields, the conference planned agricultural production for 1966, demanding efforts to strive for a relatively large increase in production.

    The conference believed that there are many favorable conditions for striving for a relatively large increase in production this year, the most important of which is the human factor. After the socialist education movement, the broad masses of rural cadres and the masses have greatly improved their socialist consciousness, are full of political enthusiasm, and are highly motivated. As long as we strengthen political and ideological work, their enthusiasm and creativity will be further developed. At present, there is a strong contingent of cadres in the countryside. If we arm this contingent with Mao Zedong Thought, and each cadre brings a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and a hoe to the forefront of production to study and apply Chairman Mao's works together with the masses, it will generate infinite power. The conference also pointed out that achieving increased agricultural production is composed of many factors, and it is not easy to generally increase yields over a large area. We must carry out arduous struggles, and we must carry out a large amount of political and ideological work and organizational work.

    The conference emphasized: Bringing a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and a hoe to the forefront of agricultural production, to the masses, is the working policy and working method of the whole province. This requires the broad masses of cadres to bring Mao Zedong Thought down, bring socialist thought down, bring science down, bring culture down, and launch a mass movement of all farmers studying Chairman Mao's works. At the same time, it is also necessary to gain production experience and the ability to lead production by participating in labor. In this way, the ideological awareness of cadres and the masses will be greatly improved, and the work style of cadres will undergo fundamental changes. The conference pointed out: If all the hundreds of thousands of cadres in the province who work in rural areas persist in doing this, it will not only have a great impact on current production, but also have a profound impact on future work.

    In order to achieve a large increase in production this year, the conference emphasized that it is necessary to continue to encourage enthusiasm, to combine revolutionary enthusiasm with a scientific attitude, to have great enthusiasm, to take steady steps, and to work both vigorously and in an orderly manner. The conference pointed out: To have great enthusiasm is to have a revolutionary spirit. Without a revolutionary spirit, it is impossible to overcome difficulties and impossible to move forward. Taking steady steps is to have a scientific spirit and a scientific attitude. The conference also pointed out that if we want to make revolution, we must work vigorously. Without working vigorously, we cannot achieve a revolution in production. But we must work in an orderly manner, with meticulous organizational work, with plans, steps, and arrangements, and correctly implement the Party's various policies.

    The conference emphasized that cadres at all levels should promote the working style of the mass line, consult with the masses in everything, and be good at turning the Party's policies into the conscious actions of the masses. Cadres at all levels should constantly do political and ideological work among the masses, do it every day.

    The conference pointed out that in the high tide of production, leading cadres at all levels must have a warm and calm mood, be calm promoters, and never engage in anything divorced from reality, or do anything that cannot be done. We must pay attention to quality in our work and not engage in formalism.

    云南省委扩大工作会议号召全省到农村工作的干部
    带上一部“毛选”一把锄头到第一线去
    学习保山地区办样板的经验，坚持以毛泽东思想挂帅，步步突出政治，事事突出政治
    据云南日报报道　中共云南省委扩大工作会议一月中旬在保山地委样板现场召开。会议号召全省所有到农村工作的干部，突出政治，带上一部“毛选”和一把锄头，到生产第一线去，充分发动群众，把农业生产搞上去，力争今年有一个较大幅度的增产。
    到会同志看了保山地区的样板田，听了关于办样板田的经验介绍，一致认为，要搞好样板，必须象保山地区那样，把阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动结合起来，以阶级斗争为纲，以生产为中心，一切通过科学实验。生产斗争和科学实验本身，都是革命运动，这两项革命运动，又都是在尖锐的阶级斗争环境中进行的。在办样板的过程中，每一步都要狠抓阶级斗争，都要突出政治。大家从保山的经验中得出一个结论：办好样板，搞好生产，最根本的一条，是毛泽东思想挂帅，是步步突出政治，事事突出政治。
    会议在总结和交流了办样板田的经验以后，规划了一九六六年的农业生产，要求力争较大幅度增产。
    会议认为，争取今年较大幅度增产，具备了许多有利的条件，其中最重要的是人的因素。广大农村干部和群众，经过社会主义教育运动，社会主义觉悟大大提高，政治热情饱满，干劲大。只要加强政治思想工作，他们的积极性和创造性，还会进一步发扬。目前农村中有一支强大的干部队伍，把这支队伍用毛泽东思想武装起来，每个干部带上一部“毛选”和一把锄头，到生产第一线去，同群众一道活学活用毛主席著作，就将产生无穷的力量。会议同时指出，实现农业增产是许许多多因素构成的，在大面积上普遍提高产量并不是一件容易的事，必须进行艰苦的奋斗，必须进行大量的政治思想工作和组织工作。
    会议强调指出：带上一部“毛选”、一把锄头，到农业生产第一线去，到群众中去，是全省的工作方针和工作方法。这就是要求广大干部把毛泽东思想带下去，把社会主义思想带下去，把科学带下去，把文化带下去，掀起一个全体农民大学毛主席著作的群众运动。同时，还要通过参加劳动，取得生产经验和领导生产的本领。这样，干部和群众的思想觉悟将会大大提高，干部的作风将会有根本的改变。会议指出：全省所有到农村工作的十几万干部，如果都坚持这样做下去，不仅对当前生产要发生巨大作用，而且对今后的工作将发生深远的影响。
    为了实现今年大幅度的增产，会议强调要继续鼓干劲，要把革命干劲和科学态度结合起来，干劲要大，步子要稳，既要紧张地工作，又要有秩序地工作。会议指出：干劲要大，就是要有革命精神。没有革命精神，就不能克服困难，就不能前进。步子要稳，就是要有科学精神、科学态度。会议还指出，我们要革命，就要紧张地工作。不紧张地工作，就不能实现生产上的革命。但是必须要有秩序地工作，要有周密细致的组织工作，有计划、有步骤、有安排，正确地贯彻党的各项政策。
    会议强调各级干部要发扬群众路线的工作作风，遇事要同群众商量，要善于把党的政策化为群众的自觉行动。各级干部要在群众中经常做政治思想工作，天天做，日日做。
    会议指出，在生产高潮中，各级领导干部一定要有热烈而镇定的情绪，要做冷静的促进派，千万不要搞脱离实际的东西，不要搞办不到的事情，办事要讲质量，不要搞形式主义。
