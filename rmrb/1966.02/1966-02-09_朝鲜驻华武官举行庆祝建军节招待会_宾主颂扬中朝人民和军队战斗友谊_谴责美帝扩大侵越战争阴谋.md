    Xinhua News Agency, February 8th -- Colonel Choi Jae-ryong, Military Attaché of the Embassy of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in China, held a reception tonight to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army.

    Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian and Bo Yibo were invited to attend the reception.

    Colonel Choi Jae-ryong and Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Li Tianyou spoke at the reception successively. In their speeches, they warmly praised the unbreakable militant friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Korea, and strongly condemned the U.S. imperialist "gradual escalation" in the war of aggression against Vietnam and its sinister plot to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina.

    Colonel Choi Jae-ryong condemned U.S. imperialism for turning South Korea into a base for atomic weapons and rockets, and for instigating Japanese militarists and the South Korean puppet clique to collude and create the "Japan-South Korea Treaty." He said that the U.S. imperialist aggressors are the culprits who have inflicted all disasters and sufferings on the Korean people, the obstacle that desperately hinders the three thousand million Korean people's long-awaited reunification of their motherland, and the root of all evil that threatens peace in the Far East and the world.

    He emphasized that the Korean people must smash the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," drive U.S. imperialism out of our territory, and realize the independent and peaceful reunification of our motherland.

    Colonel Choi Jae-ryong pointed out that U.S. imperialism is carrying out a war of aggression in South Vietnam, and recently, hiding behind the smokescreen of "peace talks," is attempting to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina. He said that the Korean people will do everything in their power to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Korean people express their firm support and sympathy for the anti-U.S. struggles of the Cambodian and Laotian peoples. As always, we will continue to advance shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people in opposing U.S. imperialism.

    Li Tianyou pointed out in his speech that, in order to save its defeat in South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam and Indochina along the ladder of "gradual escalation." Its so-called "peace offensive" is a smokescreen for further expanding the war of aggression.

    Currently, after completing its arrangements for expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Johnson administration has resumed the bombing of North Vietnam, thoroughly exposing its painstakingly managed "peace talks" fraud.

    He said that U.S. imperialism is shifting its strategic focus from Europe to Asia, preparing to wage a full-scale war of aggression in Asia. The world's people cannot but be highly vigilant against U.S. imperialism's ambition to expand the war. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are fully prepared.

    Li Tianyou said that we resolutely support the Korean people's struggle for the reunification of their motherland and against the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

    He emphasized that no matter how U.S. imperialism threatens us, no matter to what extent U.S. imperialism expands the war, we will steadfastly join the Korean people, the Vietnamese people, and the people of the world to make our own contribution to completely defeating U.S. imperialism and burying this instigator of war.

    Wang Xinting, Yang Yong, Liang Biye, Song Shilun, Zhang Lingbin, Wu Faxian, Chen Shi’qu, Zhao Qimin, Liu Shaowen, Kuang Yumin, Zhang Wenzhou, Zha Guozhen and other responsible persons of the General Headquarters, various military branches and services, and the Beijing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were invited to attend the reception.

    Han Nianlong, Ding Xilin, Li Qiang, Wan Li, Lao She and other responsible persons from relevant departments were also invited to attend.

    Korean Ambassador to China, Park Se-chang, foreign envoys and military attachés to China, also attended the reception.

    朝鲜驻华武官举行庆祝建军节招待会
    宾主颂扬中朝人民和军队战斗友谊　谴责美帝扩大侵越战争阴谋
    新华社八日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使馆武官崔济荣上校今晚举行招待会，庆祝朝鲜人民军建军十八周年。
    国务院副总理李先念、薄一波应邀出席了招待会。
    崔济荣上校和中国人民解放军副总参谋长李天佑在会上先后讲了话。他们在讲话中热烈颂扬中朝两国人民及其军队之间牢不可破的战斗友谊，并且强烈谴责美帝国主义在侵略越南战争中“逐步升级”和准备把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那的罪恶阴谋。
    崔济荣上校谴责美帝国主义把南朝鲜变成了原子武器和火箭基地，并且策动日本军国主义者和南朝鲜傀儡集团勾结制造“韩日条约”。他说，美帝国主义侵略者是把一切灾难和痛苦强加于朝鲜人民的罪魁祸首，是拼命阻挠三千万朝鲜人民日夜盼望祖国统一的障碍，是威胁远东和世界和平的祸根。
    他强调说，朝鲜人民一定要粉碎“韩日条约”，一定要把美帝国主义赶出我们的疆土，实现祖国的自主统一。
    崔济荣上校指出，美帝国主义在越南南方进行着侵略战争，最近又躲在“和平谈判”的烟幕后面，企图把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那。他说，朝鲜人民将尽一切力量坚决支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争。朝鲜人民对柬埔寨和老挝人民的抗美斗争，表示坚定的支持和同情。我们一如既往，今后仍将同反对美帝国主义的中国人民一道并肩前进。
    李天佑在讲话中指出，美帝国主义为了挽救它在南越的败局，正在沿着“逐步升级”的阶梯，扩大侵略越南和印度支那的战争。它的所谓“和平攻势”，是进一步扩大侵略战争的烟幕。
    目前，约翰逊政府在完成了扩大侵略越南战争部署之后，恢复了对越南北方的轰炸，彻底地揭穿了它苦心经营的“和谈”骗局。
    他说，美帝国主义正在把它的战略重点从欧洲转移到亚洲，准备在亚洲进行一场全面的侵略战争。对美帝国主义这种扩大战争的野心，不能不引起世界人民的高度警惕。中国人民和中国人民解放军是有充分准备的。
    李天佑说，我们坚决支持朝鲜人民统一祖国、反对“韩日条约”的斗争，坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的斗争，坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争。
    他强调说，不管美帝国主义怎样威胁我们，不管美帝国主义把战争扩大到什么地步，我们将坚定不移地和朝鲜人民、越南人民、全世界人民一道，为彻底打败美帝国主义，埋葬这个战争的罪魁祸首，作出自己的贡献。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有中国人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种、北京部队的负责人王新亭、杨勇、梁必业、宋时轮、张令彬、吴法宪、陈士榘、赵启民、刘少文、匡裕民、张文舟、查国桢等。
    有关方面负责人韩念龙、丁西林、李强、万里、老舍等也应邀出席。
    朝鲜驻中国大使朴世昌，各国驻华使节和武官，也出席了招待会。
