	After completing its deployment to expand the war, the Johnson administration resumed its barbaric bombing of North Vietnam.
	This move by U.S. imperialism was to be expected. Clear-sighted people saw long ago that the Johnson administration's so-called "peace offensive" was nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up its further expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam. The moment of truth was only a matter of time. Now, the Johnson administration has completely exposed its painstakingly constructed "peace talks" hoax with its actions.
	Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out long ago: "When we say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' it means that its nature cannot be changed. Imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, nor can they become Buddhas until their demise." The current developments in Vietnam once again prove this truth.
	While resuming the bombing of North Vietnam, the Johnson administration launched the so-called "Five Great Offensives" in South Vietnam, further expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. The ferocious features of the aggressors are once again fully exposed. U.S. imperialism is the greatest swindler and executioner of our time.
	The heroic Vietnamese people have been tempered in the long struggle against imperialist aggression. They are neither intimidated by the behemoth of U.S. imperialism nor deceived by the honeyed words of the Johnson administration. As soon as Washington's "peace talks" hoax was released, the Vietnamese people sternly exposed it and stood ready to resolutely fight back against the invaders. On the first day the Johnson administration resumed bombing, the people of North Vietnam shot down five enemy planes. This new victory of the Vietnamese people is a powerful punishment for the U.S. aggressors.
	The Johnson administration's resumption of bombing shows that U.S. imperialism has reached a dead end in Vietnam and is trying to get out of its predicament by expanding the war. However, this will only bring greater defeat to the U.S. aggressors. No matter how the Johnson administration struggles, the situation of the Vietnamese people's inevitable victory and U.S. imperialism's inevitable defeat cannot be changed.
	The U.S. imperialists are determined to fight a major war in Vietnam. What should the people of all countries do about this? They can only have one answer: resolutely support the Vietnamese people and completely defeat the U.S. aggressors! The Chinese people have always stood with the Vietnamese people. No matter to what extent U.S. imperialism expands the war, no matter how great a price we pay, we will resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying the anti-U.S. and national salvation struggle through to the end until this struggle achieves final victory!

    当代最大的骗子手和刽子手
    约翰逊政府在它完成了扩大战争的部署以后，恢复了对越南北方的野蛮轰炸。
    美帝国主义的这一手，是在人们意料之中的。明眼人早就看穿，约翰逊政府的所谓“和平攻势”，只不过是掩盖它进一步扩大侵越战争的烟幕。图穷匕见只是个时间问题。现在，约翰逊政府已经用行动彻底揭穿了它苦心经营的“和谈”大骗局。
    毛泽东同志早已指出：“我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”当前越南局势的发展，又一次证明了这个真理。
    约翰逊政府在对越南北方恢复轰炸的同时，在越南南方发动了所谓“五大攻势”，进一步扩大侵越战争。侵略者的狰狞面目又一次大暴露。美帝国主义是当代最大的骗子手和刽子手。
    英勇的越南人民，在长期反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中百炼成钢。他们既不为美帝国主义这个庞然大物所吓倒，也不为约翰逊政府的花言巧语所迷惑。华盛顿的“和谈”骗局一出笼，越南人民就严正地加以揭露，并且严阵以待，准备给侵略者以坚决的回击。越南北方人民在约翰逊政府恢复轰炸的第一天，就打下五架敌机。越南人民的这一新胜利，是对美国侵略者的有力惩罚。
    约翰逊政府的恢复轰炸，表明美帝国主义在越南问题上已走投无路，妄图以扩大战争来摆脱困境。但是，这只能给美国侵略者带来更大的失败。不管约翰逊政府怎样挣扎，越南人民必胜、美帝国主义必败的局势是改变不了的。
    美帝国主义决心在越南大打。对此，各国人民应该怎么办呢？他们只能有一个回答：坚决支持越南人民，彻底打败美国侵略者！中国人民是始终同越南人民站在一起的。不管美帝国主义把战争扩大到什么地步，不管我们将付出多大的代价，我们坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国斗争进行到底，直到这一斗争取得最后胜利！
