　　Xinhua News Agency, Honolulu, February 7th: US President Johnson, who rushed from Washington to Honolulu to convene a military conference to discuss expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, was met with protests by local residents as soon as he got off the plane in Honolulu on the 5th. Protesters shouted, "Murderer, go home!" and "Stop Johnson's war!"
　　Johnson arrived in Honolulu accompanied by a large group of military and government officials, including Secretary of State Rusk, Secretary of Defense McNamara, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Wheeler.
　　As soon as Johnson got off the plane, he was surrounded by a group of protesters who shouted slogans against the war of aggression against Vietnam and angrily waved signs that read: "Hey, hey, Johnson, how many people have you killed today?" "Murderer, go home!" "Stop the slaughter immediately!" "Genocide must be stopped!" "Yankee, go home!"
　　Fights broke out at the airport. Authorities dispatched large numbers of police to block the protesters, and some protesters were arrested.
　　Johnson was obviously deeply disturbed by the anti-war movement launched by the American people. In his speech in Honolulu, he clamored that "stopping the communists in South Vietnam is extremely important to every American family."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 7th: Vietnam's "People's Army Newspaper" published a commentary on the 7th saying that Johnson and his partners gathered in Honolulu to plot to strengthen the war of aggression. The Vietnamese people are ready at any time to crush all new aggressive plots of US imperialism.
　　The commentary said that Johnson's personal trip to Honolulu to preside over a meeting to expand the war of aggression exposes the serious failures and embarrassing situation faced by US imperialism.
　　The commentary said that the Vietnamese people have experience: whenever the US aggressors suffer failures and are in an embarrassing situation, they convene a meeting in Honolulu; and after each such war conference, they strengthen and expand their military adventures in Vietnam by one step.
　　The commentary said that this time, after the US "peace" hoax was exposed and after the US carried out a series of large-scale "mopping-up operations" in South Vietnam, Johnson and his partners gathered in Honolulu again.
　　The commentary said that the Vietnamese people are watching the US conspiracies and actions very vigilantly, and are ready at any time to crush all its new aggressive plots.

    高呼“杀人犯滚回去！”“停止约翰逊战争！”
    檀香山群众奋起示威怒逐约翰逊
    越南《人民军队报》谴责约翰逊召开战争会议
    新华社七日讯　檀香山消息：匆匆忙忙由华盛顿赶到檀香山召集军事会议讨论扩大侵越战争的美国总统约翰逊，五日在檀香山一下飞机，就遇到当地居民的抗议示威。示威者高呼：“杀人犯滚回去！”、“停止约翰逊战争！”
    约翰逊是在国务卿腊斯克、国防部长麦克纳马拉、参谋长联席会议主席惠勒等一大批军政要员的陪同下到达檀香山的。
    约翰逊刚一下飞机，就被一群示威者包围起来，他们高呼反对侵越战争的口号，愤怒地挥舞着手上的标语牌，上面写着：“嘿，嘿，约翰逊，今天你已经杀死了多少人？”、“凶手滚回去！”、“立刻停止屠杀！”、“必须停止种族灭绝行为！”、“美国佬滚回去！”
    机场上发生了殴斗。当局出动大批警察阻拦示威者，一些示威者遭到逮捕。
    约翰逊显然对美国人民展开的反战运动深感不安，他在檀香山的讲话中叫嚷说，“在南越制止共产党人对美国每个家庭都是极为重要的”。
    新华社河内七日电　越南《人民军队报》七日发表评论说，约翰逊及其伙伴聚集在檀香山是为了策划加强侵略战争。越南人民随时准备粉碎美帝国主义的一切新的侵略阴谋。
    评论说，约翰逊要亲自去檀香山主持扩大侵略战争的会议，暴露了美帝国主义所面临的严重失败和狼狈处境。
    评论说，越南人民已有经验，这就是：每当美国侵略者遭到失败和处境狼狈的时候，它就在檀香山召开一次会议；而每当召开这样的一次战争会议之后，它就把在越南的军事冒险加强和扩大一步。
    评论说，这一次，当美国的“和平”骗局被揭穿以后，以及美国在南越进行一系列大规模“扫荡”失败之后，约翰逊及其伙伴又聚集在檀香山。
    评论说，越南人民非常警惕地注视着美国的阴谋和行动，随时准备粉碎它的一切新的侵略阴谋。
