    Xinhua News Agency, London, February 6th. The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party recently issued a statement on the situation in Indonesia, saying: US imperialism, Indonesian reactionaries, and modern revisionists have once again formed an unholy alliance to crush the Indonesian Communist Party and other democratic forces.

    This statement was published in the January issue of the monthly magazine "Malayan Monitor," published in London.

    The statement said: "Since its establishment, the Indonesian Communist Party has steadfastly stood at the forefront of the Indonesian people in their struggle against imperialism and feudalism, and in defense of national independence. Therefore, the Indonesian Communist Party is one of the largest communist parties in the world, and its prestige among the Indonesian people and internationally is very high."

    The statement pointed out that the right-wing forces in Indonesia, taking advantage of the September 30th Movement, are intensifying their anti-communist and anti-people measures by attacking the Indonesian Communist Party and its affiliated mass organizations. The statement said that US imperialists, in order to carry out their policy of aggression and war, are attacking the Indonesian Communist Party—the main pillar of the anti-US united front of the Indonesian people—through their running dogs, thereby undermining the militant anti-US united front. At the same time, the US imperialists dream of crushing once and for all the Indonesian Communist Party, the vanguard of the Indonesian people, and other democratic and patriotic forces in Indonesia.

    "The Khrushchev revisionists are shamelessly supporting this despicable action by the US imperialists."

    The statement pointed out that the Indonesian experience once again proves: "Communist parties and other democratic forces must be prepared for all eventualities at all times."

    The statement said: "At the same time, in order to guarantee the final victory of the people, it is absolutely necessary to carry the struggle against the common enemy of the people of the world, US imperialists, domestic reactionaries, and modern revisionists, through to the end."

    "At this moment of trial, the Burmese people and the Communist Party, together with all other Marxist-Leninist parties and democratic forces, stand in solidarity to fully support and resolutely support the just struggle of the Indonesian Communist Party.

    "The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party is deeply convinced that the Indonesian Communist Party, led by Comrade Aidit, this experienced Marxist-Leninist party, will surely crush all reactionaries and enemies in the end and carry the Indonesian revolution through to the end." The statement expressed its belief that "the final victory must and will belong to the Indonesian people and the Indonesian Communist Party."

    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 5th. According to reports in local newspapers, working people in various parts of Albania held rallies on the 3rd to protest the terror and barbaric actions of the Indonesian reactionaries in persecuting progressive forces.

    Workers and staff in Tirana, the capital of Albania, and other cities such as Korçë, Vlorë, and Shkodër held protest rallies on the 3rd. Representatives of workers and staff in various cities, in their speeches, severely condemned the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary forces in persecuting the Indonesian Communist Party and other progressive groups, demanded the restoration of democratic freedoms and trade union rights, and demanded the immediate release of arrested progressives.

    Workers and staff in various places also expressed their full support for the struggle of the Indonesian working people to win their rights.

    The participants also condemned the support and encouragement of the Indonesian reactionary forces by imperialists and modern revisionists.

    新华社伦敦六日电　缅甸共产党中央委员会政治局最近就印度尼西亚局势发表声明说：美帝国主义、印度尼西亚反动派和现代修正主义者再次结成不神圣的联盟，要粉碎印度尼西亚共产党和其它民主力量。
    这项声明刊载在伦敦出版的《马来亚箴言》月刊一月号上。
    声明说：“印度尼西亚共产党自从建立以来，一直坚定地站在印度尼西亚人民的前列，进行反对帝国主义和封建主义的斗争，保卫民族独立。因此，印度尼西亚共产党是世界上最大的共产党之一，它在印度尼西亚人民当中以及在国际上的威信是很高的。”
    声明指出，印度尼西亚的右派势力利用九月三十日运动，通过攻击印度尼西亚共产党及其所属的群众组织，加紧推行他们的反共反人民的措施。声明说，美帝国主义者为了使自己能够执行侵略政策和战争政策，通过他们的走狗来攻击印度尼西亚共产党——印度尼西亚人民反美统一战线的主要支柱，从而破坏战斗的反美统一战线。同时，美帝国主义者梦想一劳永逸地粉碎作为印度尼西亚人民的先锋队的印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚国内的其它民主爱国力量。
      “赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在无耻地支持美帝国主义者的这个可鄙的行动。”
    声明指出，印度尼西亚的经验再一次证明：“共产党和其它民主力量必须在任何时候都为一切不测事件作好准备。”
    声明说：“同时，为了保证人民的最后胜利，绝对有必要把反对全世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义者、国内反动派和现代修正主义者的斗争进行到底。
      “在这个考验的时刻，缅甸人民和共产党同所有其它马克思列宁主义的党和民主力量在一起，团结一致地充分支援和坚决支持印度尼西亚共产党的正义斗争。
    “缅甸共产党中央委员会政治局深信，以艾地同志为首的印度尼西亚共产党这个富有经验的马克思列宁主义的党，肯定会最后粉碎一切反动派和敌人，把印度尼西亚的革命进行到底。”声明表示相信，“最后的胜利必定属于而且将会属于印度尼西亚人民和印度尼西亚共产党。”
    新华社地拉那五日电　据此间报纸报道：阿尔巴尼亚各地劳动人民三日分别集会，抗议印度尼西亚反动派迫害进步势力的恐怖和野蛮行动。
    阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那和科尔察、发罗拉、斯库台等城市的职工在三日分别举行抗议集会。各城市的职工代表在他们的发言中，严厉谴责印度尼西亚反动势力迫害印度尼西亚共产党和其他进步团体的法西斯暴行，要求恢复民主自由和工会的权利，并立即释放被捕的进步人士。
