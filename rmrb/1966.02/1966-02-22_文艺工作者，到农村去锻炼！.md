　　At present, about 160,000 literary and art workers across the country are going down to the countryside, factories and mines, and military companies. This vast army of literary and art workers eats, lives, and labors alongside workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving them and tempering and transforming themselves in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation. This is the largest and most influential socialist cultural march since liberation. We congratulate this vast army of literary and art workers for making new contributions to the socialist cultural revolution.

　　Literature and art serving proletarian politics, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving the socialist economic base is the most correct and thorough proletarian cultural revolution line put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong. This cultural revolution line requires the revolutionization and laborization of literary and art workers, and at the same time requires the intellectualization of the working people, so that culture gradually becomes the culture of all working people themselves. The fundamental path for the revolutionization and laborization of literary and art workers is to go deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers and integrate with them; in particular, to face the countryside, serve the 500 million peasants, and go to the countryside to temper and transform themselves.

　　Now, the vast majority of these 160,000 literary and art workers are tempering themselves in the countryside, some participating in the rural socialist education movement, some participating in cultural work teams, professional performance teams, creative writing groups, etc. This is a major event of historical significance. Peasants account for the vast majority of our country's population. The peasant issue is of extreme importance in socialist revolution and construction. Today, in our country's countryside, the socialist education movement is proceeding in depth, and a new upsurge in agricultural production is flourishing. The 500 million peasants, especially the vast numbers of poor and lower-middle peasants, in the rural class struggle, the struggle between the two roads, and in the production struggle to transform heaven and earth and conquer nature, have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, demonstrated the noble qualities of putting the public first and being selfless, and a large number of new people and new deeds worthy of praise have emerged. Today's countryside is also an important front for carrying out the socialist cultural revolution. Literary and art workers, going deep into the fiery struggles of the countryside, sharing the breath and destiny of the vast numbers of poor and lower-middle peasants, truly becoming one with them, serving them wholeheartedly, and earnestly tempering themselves in labor and struggle, will certainly be able to gradually transform their world outlook and realize the revolutionization and laborization of intellectuals, and will certainly be able to make their own contributions to the popularization of socialist culture in the countryside.

　　Literary and art workers in the countryside, living and laboring side by side with the vast numbers of peasants, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, deeply feel the revolutionary stand of the poor and lower-middle peasants in firmly taking the socialist road, and see the tenacious fighting spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants in building a new socialist countryside through self-reliance. They are deeply educated and gradually strengthened their determination to transform themselves, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve the 500 million peasants. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "China's vast revolutionary intellectuals should realize the necessity of uniting themselves with the peasants." The vast numbers of literary and art workers have gradually raised their awareness of this integration with the peasants in the practice of rural struggle and life, which is a good start.

　　Literary and art workers are right to say: "To perform revolutionary dramas well, one must first be a revolutionary person." Only by truly throwing oneself into the fiery struggles of the worker-peasant-soldier masses, studying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, familiarizing oneself with the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the struggle, learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, integrating one's own thoughts and feelings with the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and carrying out artistic practice on the basis of life practice, can one write and perform well the heroic images of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and can one truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers with revolutionary literary and artistic weapons. As Comrade Mao Zedong taught: "If you want the masses to understand you, if you want to become one with the masses, you must make up your mind and undergo long-term, even painful, tempering." Only by taking the road of first being a student and then being a teacher, of transforming oneself first in order to serve, and firmly grasping the central link of transforming oneself, can one gain something by going to the countryside, and can one serve well.

　　In the past, some literary and art workers also went to the countryside. However, they often only went to "experience" life, to collect materials, and put themselves outside of the real struggle; some were very enthusiastic about performing, but did not consider whether the content of the play was beneficial or harmful; some were very enthusiastic about popularizing culture, but did not base it on the needs and possibilities of the masses, forgetting that culture cannot develop in isolation from the economic base, and becoming culture for the sake of culture. These lessons must be remembered. Today's revolutionary literary and art workers who go to the countryside should put going deep into life, studying hard, participating in the struggle, and transforming themselves first, and should not put their own professional work first, let alone superficially "experience" life or simply collect materials. The author of the excellent full-length novel "The Song of Ouyang Hai" was originally an actor and only started writing in 1958. In recent years, he has often gone down to the troops, spending almost half of the year in the troops; at first, he went down mainly for creative work, but for a long time, he couldn't write anything good. Why? He initially thought it was a matter of expression ability, but later realized that it was still a matter of thought and life, and that his understanding of soldiers was not as deep as the soldiers' understanding of themselves. From then on, he resolved to be a good soldier, participate in field camping, and work with the soldiers. His body went down, and his heart went down, and his thoughts and feelings gradually became one with the soldiers, and the situation became very different. "The Song of Ouyang Hai," a work reflecting and praising the spirit of the socialist era, which was warmly welcomed by the vast number of readers, was finally created. This shows that as long as you earnestly transform yourself and study hard, you will definitely have good results, you will definitely improve your own professional work, and you will make greater contributions.

　　Literary and art comrades who have thrown themselves into the vast furnace of rural revolutionary struggle: Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, firmly grasp the central link of tempering ourselves and transforming ourselves, become one with the poor and lower-middle peasants, share their joys and sorrows, gradually understand their hearts, gradually understand their love and hate, and understand what they need or do not need. As long as we truly follow the proletarian cultural revolution line put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong, persevere unremittingly, and accumulate over time, we will certainly be able to realize our wish to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and will not only contribute to the cause of socialist cultural revolution in the countryside, but will also have a huge impact on the prosperity and flourishing of the entire socialist culture.

### 文艺工作者，到农村去锻炼！

　　文艺工作者，到农村去锻炼！
    目前，全国大约有十六万文艺工作者下农村、下厂矿、下连队。这支文艺大军，跟工农兵同吃、同住、同劳动，为工农兵服务，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中锻炼自己，改造自己。这是解放以来规模最大、影响最深的一次社会主义文化大进军。我们祝贺这支文艺大军为社会主义文化革命作出新的贡献。
    文艺为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务，为社会主义经济基础服务，这是毛泽东同志提出的最正确、最彻底的无产阶级文化革命的路线。这条文化革命的路线，要求文艺工作者革命化、劳动化，同时要求劳动人民知识化，使文化逐渐成为全体劳动人民自己的文化。文艺工作者革命化、劳动化的根本道路，就是深入工农兵，与工农兵相结合；特别是要面向农村，为五亿农民服务，到农村去锻炼自己，改造自己。
    现在，这十六万文艺工作者中的绝大多数，正在农村锻炼，有的参加农村社会主义教育运动，有的参加文化工作队、专业演出队、创作小组等等，这是一件具有历史意义的大事。农民占我国人口的绝大多数。农民问题在社会主义革命和建设中，具有极大重要性。今天，在我国农村中，社会主义教育运动正在深入进行，农业生产的新高潮正在蓬勃发展。五亿农民，特别是广大贫农下中农，在农村阶级斗争、两条道路的斗争中，在改天换地、征服自然的生产斗争中，发扬了艰苦奋斗的革命精神，表现出先公后私、公而忘私的崇高品质，涌现了大量的可歌可颂的新人新事。今天的农村，也是开展社会主义文化革命的重要阵地。文艺工作者深入农村的火热斗争中，同广大贫农下中农同呼吸，共命运，真正打成一片，全心全意为他们服务，在劳动和斗争中认真锻炼自己，就一定能逐步改造自己的世界观，实现知识分子的革命化、劳动化，就一定能为农村的社会主义文化普及工作，作出自己的贡献。
    文艺工作者在农村，跟广大农民，特别是贫农下中农共同生活，并肩劳动，深切体会到贫农下中农坚定地走社会主义道路的革命立场，看到贫农下中农自力更生建设社会主义新农村的顽强斗争精神。他们受到深刻的教育，逐步坚定了改造自己、为工农兵服务、为五亿农民服务的决心。毛泽东同志说：“中国广大的革命知识分子应该觉悟到将自己和农民结合起来的必要。”广大文艺工作者在农村斗争、生活的实践中，逐步提高了这种同农民结合的自觉性，是个良好的开端。
    文艺工作者说得对：“要演好革命戏，先做革命人。”只有真正投身到工农兵群众的火热斗争中去，在斗争中学习毛主席著作，在斗争中熟悉工农兵，学习工农兵，把自己的思想感情同工农兵的思想感情打成一片，在生活实践的基础上进行艺术实践，才能写好、演好工农兵的英雄形象，才能真正以革命的文艺武器为工农兵服务。正如毛泽东同志教导的：“你要群众了解你，你要和群众打成一片，就得下决心，经过长期的甚至是痛苦的磨练。”只有走先做学生后做先生、为了服务先要改造这一条道路，紧紧地抓住改造自己这个中心环节，到农村去才能有收获，才能服务得好。
    过去，有些文艺工作者也下过乡，也到过农村。可是，他们往往只是为了“体验”生活，为了收集素材，而把自己置身于现实斗争之外；有的主观上也很热心去演戏，但不考虑戏的内容是有益还是有害；有的也很热心去普及文化，却不根据群众的需要与可能，忘记了文化不能脱离经济基础孤立地发展，变成为文化而文化。这些教训是必须记取的。今天到农村去的革命文艺工作者，应该把深入生活、努力学习、参加斗争、改造自己放在第一位，不能把本身的业务放在第一位，更不能浮光掠影地去“体验”生活，或者单纯收集素材。优秀的长篇小说《欧阳海之歌》的作者，原来是演员，一九五八年起才搞创作。这些年来，他经常下部队，一年几乎有一半的时间在部队；起初下去主要是为了创作，但在很长一段时间里，总写不出好东西来。为什么？他开始认为是表达能力的问题，后来才认识到还是思想、生活不过硬，自己对兵的理解，不象兵对兵的理解那样深。从此，他下决心好好当兵，参加野营，跟战士一起干，身子下去了，心也下去了，思想感情逐渐和战士打成一片，情况就大不相同了。《欧阳海之歌》这一部反映和歌颂社会主义时代精神，受到广大读者热烈欢迎的作品，终于创作出来了。由此可见，只要认真改造自己，努力学习，一定会有很好的结果，一定会提高本身的业务，作出更大的贡献。
    投身到广阔的农村革命斗争洪炉中的文艺工作同志们：让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，紧紧地抓住锻炼自己、改造自己这个中心环节，同贫农下中农打成一片，同他们同甘共苦，逐步懂得他们的心，逐步懂得他们的爱和憎，懂得他们需要什么或不需要什么。只要真正遵循毛泽东同志提出的无产阶级文化革命的路线，坚持不懈，积以时日，就一定能够实现自己为工农兵服务的愿望，不仅对农村的社会主义文化革命事业作出贡献，对整个社会主义文化的繁荣和昌盛，也将起巨大的影响。
