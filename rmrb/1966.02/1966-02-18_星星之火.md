　　A Single Spark
　　On the African continent, another area has ignited the flames of armed struggle. The people of Equatorial Guinea have begun to take up arms to resist Spanish colonial rule.
　　Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Oppressed nations and oppressed people will always rise up to fight for independence and freedom. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the wheel of history from advancing, revolution will sooner or later occur and will inevitably achieve victory." Although imperialists and modern revisionists are doing everything possible to reverse the great historical trend of the national liberation movement, oppressed nations are increasingly aware that their contradiction with imperialism must be resolved through national revolutionary war; they realize that freedom cannot be bestowed as a gift, but must be won with armed force; they realize that independence and political power come from the barrel of a gun.
　　The sound of guns fighting for independence and freedom has sounded in Guadarripe. Of course, for the people of Equatorial Guinea, this is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles. They still have to go through a difficult and tortuous combat process. The revolutionary forces of the people of Equatorial Guinea, like all new forces, are not strong from the beginning. However, as long as they embark on the road of armed struggle and persevere unyieldingly, their strength will surely develop and grow rapidly until they completely defeat the enemy and achieve independence and liberation. "A single spark can start a prairie fire," this universally applicable truth will be verified once again in Equatorial Guinea.

    星星之火
    在非洲大陆上，又一个地区燃起了武装斗争的烽火。赤道几内亚人民开始拿起武器反抗西班牙的殖民统治。
    有压迫，就有反抗。被压迫民族和被压迫人民，总是要起来争取独立和自由的。毛泽东同志说过：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”尽管帝国主义和现代修正主义者千方百计想要扭转民族解放运动这一伟大的历史潮流，被压迫民族越来越清楚地认识到，他们同帝国主义之间的矛盾必须用民族革命战争的方法去解决，认识到了自由是不能恩赐的，要用武装力量去争取；认识到了枪杆子里面出独立、出政权。
    争取独立和自由的枪声在瓜达利佩镇打响了。当然，这对于赤道几内亚人民来说，这不过是万里长征的第一步，他们还要经历一段艰苦、曲折的战斗的历程。赤道几内亚人民的革命力量，和一切新生的力量一样并不是一开始就是强大的。但是，只要他们走上了武装斗争的道路，不折不挠地坚持下去，他们的力量就一定会很快地发展和壮大起来，直到彻底打败敌人，取得独立和解放。“星星之火，可以燎原”，这一放诸四海皆准的真理，必将在赤道几内亚得到再一次验证。
