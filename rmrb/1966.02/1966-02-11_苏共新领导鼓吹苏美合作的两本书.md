Title: Two Books Trumpeting Soviet-U.S. Cooperation by the New Soviet Leadership
Author:
Date: 1966-02-11
Edition: 5

    Since the new Soviet leadership came to power, in a short period of over a year, it has published a large number of books promoting Soviet-U.S. cooperation. *The Dynamics of American Foreign Policy* and *The Soviet Union and the United States—Their Political and Economic Relations* are two representative examples.
    These books, under the guise of discussing American foreign policy and the history of Soviet-U.S. relations, try their best to conceal the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, portraying the history of relations between socialist Soviet Union and imperialist United States as a history of "comprehensive cooperation," and advocating that the Soviet-U.S. alliance should dominate the world. These books willfully distort reality, tamper with history, betray Marxism-Leninism, and defend the line of Soviet-U.S. "comprehensive cooperation."
    Although these books use a lot of space to talk about the aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism and express condemnation of U.S. imperialism, the conclusion is always: the ruling faction of the U.S. ruling group is the "wise faction," the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism can be changed, and the line of Soviet-U.S. "comprehensive cooperation" is unchangeable. This exposes the hypocritical anti-American stance put on by the new Soviet leadership, which is nothing more than a smokescreen to deceive the people of the world.
    The books published by the new Soviet leadership, in spreading the fallacies of worshiping, fawning on, fearing, and allying with the United States, not only inherit but are even more blatant, more thorough, and more sickening than similar books published during the Khrushchev era. Running through these books is the black line of Khrushchev's revisionist general line of so-called "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful competition," and "peaceful transition."
    *The Dynamics of American Foreign Policy* and *The Soviet Union and the United States—Their Political and Economic Relations* have already been translated and published by World Knowledge Press and distributed throughout the country. Now, the main arguments of these two books are introduced as follows:

    *The Dynamics of American Foreign Policy*
    Compiled by the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
    Edited by H. Lemin
    Published by Soviet "Science" Press in 1965

    Promoting the Idea that the Aggressive Nature of U.S. Imperialism Has Changed
    This book says, "Recognizing the reality of the 'nuclear age'—this is a constantly functioning factor that is conducive to maintaining peace and improving Soviet-U.S. relations." The "absolute weapons" possessed by the Soviet Union "force American leaders to greatly change their way of thinking." The United States recognizes that "a rocket-nuclear war is suicide for the United States, so it must seek some way out other than war." The book says, "Only madmen, only those who commit suicide, can use war as a tool of their policy. The policy of peaceful coexistence has become an objective necessity, a historical inevitability." "The U.S. government has shown a willingness to compromise in many cases."
    The book says that "the main driving force of American international policy," "the main factor determining the current course of action of the United States," is "the struggle and competition between the two systems." "The American ruling class has more or less begun to understand that the decisive arena of the current world class struggle is peaceful economic competition. It is here that the fate of capitalism is being decided."

    Dividing the U.S. Ruling Group into "Wise" and "Belligerent" Factions
    This book emphasizes that "the nature of imperialism cannot be viewed abstractly," and believes that "a unique situation has formed in the American monopoly group." The book divides the American monopoly bourgeoisie into "calm, wise" and "belligerent, aggressive" factions, saying "we cannot regard the entire American society as a monolithic entity, we cannot fail to see the struggle within American society, that is, the struggle between the two trends in the ruling camp—the belligerent, aggressive trend and the moderate, sober trend." The book says, "There is a struggle between the steady faction and the aggressive faction in the American ruling group, big businessmen, Congress, and national institutions."
    This book believes that "the struggle between adventurous and aggressive trends and calm and wise trends in foreign and military policies is increasingly sweeping through the ranks of the real rulers of the United States—the largest domestic monopoly organizations." "Two foreign policy trends in American social life, that is, the struggle between two groups—the extremely reactionary, crazy aggressors and the moderate and calm who tend to wisely estimate the existing balance of power and tend to peaceful coexistence, has reached its peak."
    The book says, "The struggle between the two tendencies in American foreign policy, namely, the belligerent, aggressive, anti-Soviet and the moderate, sober, and willing to peacefully coexist with the Soviet Union, will continue and will intensify," "Soviet-U.S. relations will largely depend on the process and outcome of the struggle between the two opposing tendencies, the two factions, in American socio-political life."

    Extensively Praising the American Democratic Party
    The book says that in the United States, "in recent years, there has been a trend of clarifying certain boundaries between the two parties," "The Democratic Party has begun to rely more on trade unions, working people, and intellectuals as its mass base. In domestic and foreign policies, the Democratic Party has become the embodiment of more flexible, more cautious, and liberal state management methods," "The Democratic Party is widely supported by workers, staff, intellectuals, and blacks in elections, and more moderate and calm bourgeois groups are moving closer to the Democratic Party." The book also says that the Democratic Party "expressed its willingness to 'welcome' any signs that would indicate that the government of the People's Republic of China hopes to ease relations with the United States." The book even quotes the lie that Kennedy said at a press conference a week before his death, "We have not sworn to adopt a hostile policy towards Red China," to cover up the anti-China policy of the American ruling group.

    Extremely Praising Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson
    Regarding Eisenhower, the book says that Eisenhower "the President himself at the time represented the more moderate people who did not intend to implement their adventurous propositions and risk a major war," "It seems that he cannot be classified as an extreme militarist." The book says that during Eisenhower's administration, "through the dense fog of the 'Cold War', the sun shone for the first time, and the first signs of easing international tensions appeared." The book believes that "Eisenhower is essentially a representative of the non-public bipartisan anti-isolationist group."
    Regarding Kennedy, the entire book spares no effort to praise him from beginning to end. The book says that Kennedy was a "popular" president, "an outstanding politician who understood the reality of the nuclear age, and understood the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence. In his speeches and letters, he has always opened the door to negotiations on controversial international issues. Kennedy promised to guarantee lasting peace in the 1960 election, and he showed that he was better at dealing with the Soviet Union than his predecessors." "It would be wrong to regard the peace-loving remarks and peace-loving actions of the Kennedy administration as merely campaign motives."
    The book boasts that after Kennedy came to power, he tried his best to cooperate with the Soviet Union, saying that "before he was tragically murdered, the line aimed at seriously improving U.S.-Soviet relations and eliminating the 'Cold War' was becoming increasingly clear." The book says that Kennedy "called for an end to the Cold War and sought ways for disarmament. Kennedy tried hard to persuade people that the United States' attitude towards the Soviet Union must be re-examined." "Kennedy believed that existing differences can and must be eliminated by peaceful means, that is, to ensure peaceful coexistence."
    The book quotes the opinions of so-called "moderate, clear-headed people in the United States," saying that Kennedy "stopped in time during the Caribbean crisis because he understood that an invasion of Cuba would cause a thermonuclear disaster." The book praises "the role played by Kennedy in the final stage of the Caribbean crisis," "which raised his reputation to an unprecedented height." "There is good reason to say that 1963 was a turning point in American foreign policy." The book also praises "President Kennedy's broad vision, calm attitude towards the urgent issues of international life, and willingness to seek some kind of 'temporary agreement' with the socialist world." The book also quoted Khrushchev's telegram to Johnson after Kennedy was assassinated: "Kennedy's death is a blow to all those who cherish peace and the cause of Soviet-U.S. cooperation."
    Regarding the current U.S. President Johnson, who is frantically expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, the book says that he "is an activist who can adapt to various political factions without leaning towards political adventures," and that he "pays great attention to fulfilling his campaign promises." "During the campaign, Johnson firmly advocated peaceful coexistence, preventing thermonuclear disasters, stopping the 'Cold War', and thoroughly improving Soviet-U.S. relations." The book says that the U.S. "The 1964 election became a national referendum on the issue of war and peace, and in this referendum, Johnson received the absolute mandate of the people to implement a policy aimed at consolidating peace, eliminating the 'Cold War', and seeking Soviet-U.S. rapprochement." The book also says that "fairness should be given to Johnson, an experienced and very cautious and moderate politician: in the 1964 election campaign, he at least accepted Goldwater's challenge on foreign policy, and confronted political adventurism and a belligerent aggressive program with slogans that were somewhat wiser, more realistic international cooperation and easing tensions."
    The book places great hope on Johnson, saying that "Johnson and the Democratic Party will win the 1968 election. In other words, it should be considered that in the most recent eight years (1964 to 1972), the leadership of American foreign policy will be in the hands of Johnson and the Democratic Party. Johnson's victory in the election was mainly due to his foreign policy program. He promised to follow the foreign policy direction of the late President Kennedy."
    In addition, the book also praises the current U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara as "powerful," and even embellishes the notorious war-monger MacArthur as a "supporter of moderate, calm, and realistic policies." The book also embellishes the current U.S. Vice President Humphrey, Senate Democratic Leader Mansfield, and Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright as "the 'left-wing' liberals in Congress," saying that they often "criticize the diplomatic activities of the Democratic government from the left," and "often put forward suggestions for easing international tensions in the spirit of peaceful coexistence and oppose the aggressive and provocative behavior of the United States."

    Distorting the Marxist-Leninist Theory of the State
    In order to create a theoretical basis for the so-called "independent role" of "moderate" and "clear-headed" American presidents in formulating and implementing foreign policy, the book emphasizes the "independence" of the American government, and actually regards the state as being above classes. The book says, "The role of foreign policy in social life has increased, and the struggle surrounding international issues in the ruling camp has intensified. These situations have further strengthened the relatively independent role of the state (such as the president, government agencies, especially diplomatic and military agencies) in formulating and implementing foreign policy guidelines."
    The book slanders Stalin's Marxist-Leninist principle that the modern bourgeois state is subordinate to monopoly organizations, and babbles that Stalin's theory "belittles the role of the state, degrades the significance of the state, denies that the state has a certain independence and initiative, and degrades the state as a servant of a certain private bank or trust."

    Promoting the "Common Interests" and "Tradition of Friendly Cooperation" between the Soviet Union and the United States
    When describing the "historical nature and historical tradition" of Soviet-U.S. relations, the book writes: "The United States and Russia have been linked by traditional friendly and cooperative ties," "Apart from the stain of the United States' participation in the military intervention against Soviet Russia from 1918 to 1920, Russian-American and Soviet-American relations have not been overshadowed by any military conflicts and wars. On the contrary, during World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union were allies, which can prove the commonality of the national interests of the two countries."
    The book believes that "a very important feature of Soviet-U.S. relations" is: "Even now, there are no territorial or economic disputes and conflicts between the two countries. Their national interests do not conflict with each other, either on a global scale or in any local area."

    Advocating Soviet-U.S. "Peaceful Coexistence" and "Peaceful Competition"
    The book says, "No matter how great the confrontation between the two systems is, there is also a reliable key to solving it, that is, Lenin's brilliant discovery—the principle of peaceful coexistence." The book says, "If we recognize the destructiveness of thermonuclear war and do not allow it to happen, and recognize that peaceful coexistence is a inviolable criterion of international life, then the competition between the two socio-economic systems and the ideological struggle between the two main opponents on the international stage will be limited to a wide range of economic, diplomatic, scientific, and cultural competition and cooperation without bloody conflict and war."
    The book urgently asks to expand Soviet-U.S. trade and realize Soviet-U.S. cooperation, saying that "The decision of the U.S. Congress at the end of 1963 to agree to sell grain to the Soviet Union and allow the president to grant corresponding loans can be said to be a promising start"; and that "In November 1964, ninety-two prominent activists from American banking and industrial groups visited Moscow," and "American industrialists promised to use their influence to normalize and expand Soviet-U.S. economic ties."

    Boasting that Soviet-U.S. Relations are the "Axis of World Politics"
    This book says, "Soviet-U.S. relations, the relations between the world's two strongest countries, are the axis of world politics and the main foundation of international peace." The book quotes U.S. Secretary of State Rusk, emphasizing "the special responsibility of the two great powers—the Soviet Union and the United States—for the fate of the world and the fate of mankind." The book says, "In his words, the leaders of the two countries 'understand that any head of the Soviet government and any president of the United States bear a special responsibility for maintaining universal peace out of necessity: it is no exaggeration to say that in the current nuclear age, they bear the responsibility of maintaining the survival of the Northern Hemisphere'. Well said."
    The book says that the Soviet Union "is committed to peace and cooperation with the United States, believing that Soviet-U.S. relations are the primary issue in contemporary world politics and the key to the issue of war and peace."
    The book repeatedly praises the Khrushchev revisionist group's shameful act of implementing Soviet-U.S. cooperation to dominate the world. The book says that the signing of the Soviet-U.S.-British partial nuclear test ban treaty "is a sign of some changes in U.S. policy," "is an important step on the road to easing international tensions, and it demonstrates the vitality of the policy of peaceful coexistence." The signing of this treaty is "a great victory for good people all over the world."

    Approved for publication by the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
    Written by B.A. Varikov
    Published by Soviet "Science" Press in 1965

    Declaring that the Policy of Comprehensive Cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States is Unchanged
    This book says, "The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have consistently believed in the past and present that the normalization of Soviet-U.S. relations is of paramount importance." The book quoted this argument from the resolution of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on Khrushchev's report: "Improving relations between the Soviet Union and the United States will play a decisive role in promoting the healthy development of the international situation, because the Soviet Union and the United States are two countries that bear special responsibility for the fate of universal peace."
    The book emphasizes that "the Soviet Union's policy aimed at establishing comprehensive cooperation with the United States is unchanged."
    The book says, "The Soviet state has consistently pursued a policy of comprehensive cooperation with the United States from the very beginning of its establishment." "From the very beginning of its existence, the Soviet state has sought and continues to seek to establish business cooperation and friendly relations with the United States. The Soviet state has repeatedly put forward suggestions for establishing normal political, economic, and cultural relations and developing comprehensive cooperation."
    The book says, "The history of Soviet-U.S. relations from 1917 to 1941 convincingly shows that peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States is in the interests of the people of the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as the people of other countries."

    Promoting the Idea that the U.S. Ruling Group is Willing to Coexist and Cooperate with the Soviet Union
    This book repeatedly promotes "two trends that have played a role in the United States in the past and continue to play a role now": one is the trend of "implementing an open anti-Soviet policy," and the other is the trend of "establishing cooperation with the Soviet Union and developing political, economic, and cultural ties with the Soviet Union."
    This book says, "Many American statesmen admit that powerful countries like the United States and the Soviet Union can coexist and cooperate, whether in war years or in the post-war period." The book says, "The Soviet-U.S. cooperation during World War II created favorable conditions for permanently ending the unrealistic and short-sighted anti-Soviet policy of the U.S. ruling group before the war and for developing effective Soviet-U.S. relations in the post-war period."
    This book praises that "the more far-sighted and clear-headed representatives of the U.S. ruling group advocate implementing a more realistic foreign policy, that is, a policy of peaceful coexistence with countries with different socio-economic systems, and advocate seeking ways to conduct effective negotiations with the Soviet Union. They clearly understand that in the current international situation, the only acceptable basis for cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union is peaceful coexistence and competition in the economic, scientific, technological, cultural, and other fields."

     Boasting about the Facts of Soviet-U.S. Collusion and Joint Actions
    The book promotes a series of proposals made by the Khrushchev revisionist group directly to the U.S. government to improve the political and economic relations between the two countries, and lists the joint actions of the Soviet Union and the United States in the United Nations since 1959, as well as a series of examples of mutual collusion, to prove that Soviet-U.S. cooperation must be realized.
    The book says, "The joint draft of the resolution on comprehensive and thorough disarmament formulated for the United Nations (November 1959), the joint resolution of the United Nations on the use of outer space for peaceful purposes (December 1959), the joint proposal on disarmament principles submitted by the Soviet Union and the United States to the 16th United Nations General Assembly, and the agreement on the use of Antarctica solely for peaceful purposes, The agreement on the universe concluded between the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration on June 8, 1963, are signs of possible business cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States."
    The book vigorously boasts about the notorious partial nuclear test ban treaty, saying that "The treaty on prohibiting nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, outer space, and underwater, signed in Moscow on August 5, 1963, in accordance with the agreement of the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and the resolution unanimously adopted at the 18th United Nations General Assembly in October 1963 on not placing objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other type of weapons of mass destruction into orbit around the earth, in accordance with the mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States, received a major response around the world. These resolutions are in the interests of all mankind, help ease international tensions and improve mutual relations between countries, including Soviet-U.S. relations, and create the premise for consolidating mutual trust between countries with different socio-economic systems, that is, for taking new steps to improve the international atmosphere."
    The book finally boasts that the development of Soviet-U.S. cooperative relations "is vitally necessary not only for the people of the Soviet Union and the United States, but also for the fate of all mankind."

### 苏共新领导鼓吹苏美合作的两本书

    苏共新领导鼓吹苏美合作的两本书
    苏共新领导上台以后，短短一年多的时间里，出版了一大批宣扬苏美合作的书籍。《美国对外政策的动力》和《苏联和美国——它们的政治关系和经济关系》，是其中具有代表性的两本。
    这些书，以论述美国对外政策和苏美关系史为名，极力掩盖美帝国主义的侵略实质，把社会主义的苏联和帝国主义的美国的关系史说成是一部“全面合作”的历史，鼓吹苏美联盟主宰世界。这些书肆意歪曲现实，篡改历史，背叛马克思列宁主义，为苏美“全面合作”的路线辩护。
    这些书，虽然也用了不少篇幅，谈到美帝国主义的侵略活动，表示谴责美帝国主义，但是说来说去，结论总是：美国统治集团的当权派是“明智派”，美帝国主义的侵略本性是可以改变的，苏美“全面合作”的路线是不可改变的。这就揭穿了苏共新领导装出的一副反美姿态，不过是欺骗世界人民的障眼手法而已。
    苏共新领导出版的这些书籍，在散布崇美、媚美、恐美、联美的谬论方面，比起赫鲁晓夫时期出版的同类主题的书籍来，不仅一脉相承，而且更加露骨，更加彻底，更加肉麻。贯穿着这些书的一条黑线，就是所谓“和平共处”、“和平竞赛”、“和平过渡”的赫鲁晓夫修正主义总路线。
    《美国对外政策的动力》和《苏联和美国——它们的政治关系和经济关系》这两本书，已经由世界知识出版社翻译出版，在全国发行。现在，把这两本书的主要论点介绍如下：
    《美国对外政策的动力》
    苏联科学院世界经济和国际关系研究所编
    H·列明主编
    苏联《科学》出版社一九六五年出版
    宣扬美帝国主义的侵略本性已经改变
    这本书说，“认识‘核世纪’的现实性——这是有利于维护和平和改善苏美关系的经常起作用的因素”。苏联拥有的“绝对武器”，“迫使美国领导人大大改变自己的思想方式”，美国认识到，“火箭—核战争对美国来说是自杀，因此必须寻求战争以外的某种出路”。书中说，“只有疯人，只有自杀者，才能把战争作为自己政策的工具。和平共处政策成了客观的必要性，历史的必然性”。“美国政府在许多情况下都表示出了妥协的意愿”。
    书中说，“美国国际政策的主要动力”、“决定着美国当前行动方针的主要因素”，是“两种制度的斗争和竞赛”。“美国统治阶级或多或少地开始理解到，当前世界阶级力量的具有决定性的斗争场所是和平经济竞赛。资本主义的命运正是在这里来决定”。
    把美国统治集团分为“明智的”和“好战的”两派
    这本书强调“不能抽象地看待帝国主义本性”，认为“在美国垄断集团中，形成了一种独特的情况”。书中把美国垄断资产阶级分为“冷静的、明智的”和“好战的、侵略的”两派，说“我们不能把整个美国社会都说成是一丘之貉，不能不看到美国社会内部的斗争，即统治阵营中两种趋势——好战的、侵略性的趋势同温和的、清醒的趋势之间的斗争”。书中说，“在美国统治集团、大生意人、国会和国家机构里都存在着稳健派和侵略派的斗争”。
    这本书认为，“对外政策和军事政策中冒险主义的和侵略的趋势同冷静的和明智的趋势这两者之间的斗争，正日益强烈地席卷着美国的真正统治者队伍——国内最大垄断组织”。“美国社会生活中两种对外政策趋向，即两个集团——极端反动的疯狂侵略派和倾向于明智地估计现有力量对比、倾向于和平共处的温和冷静派之间的斗争已达极点。”
    书中说，“美国对外政策上的好战、侵略、反苏以及温和、清醒、愿同苏联和平共处这两种倾向之间的斗争将继续下去，并将尖锐化”，“苏美关系在很大程度上将取决于美国社会政治生活中两个对立倾向、两个派别之间斗争的过程和结局”。
    对美国民主党大肆吹捧
    书中说，美国“近几年来，出现了两党之间划清某种界限的趋向”，“民主党开始更多地指靠工会、劳动人民、知识分子，把他们当作自己的群众基础，在对内对外政策上，民主党成了比较灵活，比较慎重和自由主义的国家管理方法的体现者”，“民主党在选举中则受到工人、职员、知识界、黑人的广泛支持，比较温和而冷静的资产阶级集团都向民主党靠拢”。这本书还说，民主党“表示准备‘欢迎’任何足以说明中华人民共和国政府希望缓和同美国的关系的迹象”。书中甚至引用肯尼迪临死前一个星期在记者招待会上说的“我们并没有发誓要对红色中国采取敌对政策”的谎言，来掩盖美国统治集团的反华政策。
    极力颂扬艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪和约翰逊
    对于艾森豪威尔，书中说，艾森豪威尔“总统本人在当时代表比较温和的、无意实行自己的冒险主张和冒大战危险的人士”，“似乎不能把他归入极端军国主义分子一类”。书中说，在艾森豪威尔执政时期，“透过‘冷战’的浓雾，第一次露出了阳光，出现了某种缓和国际紧张局势的最初征兆”。书中认为，“艾森豪威尔实质上是不公开的两党反孤立主义集团的代表人物”。
    对于肯尼迪，全书从头到尾不遗余力地加以吹捧。书中说，肯尼迪是“受人民欢迎的”总统，“是一位杰出的政治家，他了解核时代的现实性，了解和平共处的可能性和必要性。他在自己的讲话和信件中一向为举行关于有争论的国际问题的谈判敞开着大门。肯尼迪在一九六○年选举中曾答应保证持久和平，他表现出他是一个比他的前任更善于同苏联打交道的人。”“如果把肯尼迪政府发表爱好和平的言论和采取爱好和平的行动仅仅看成是竞选动机，那是错误的”。
    书中吹嘘肯尼迪上台后，极力要同苏联进行合作，说什么“在他惨遭毒手之前，旨在认真改善美苏关系、消除‘冷战’的路线是日益明显而清楚的”。书中说，肯尼迪“呼吁停止冷战，寻求裁军的途径。肯尼迪极力说服人们必须重新审查美国对苏联的态度”。“肯尼迪认为可以而且必须用和平方法消除现有分歧，也就是保障和平共处”。
    书中引用所谓“美国温和的、头脑清醒的人士”的意见，说肯尼迪在加勒比海危机中“及时止步，因为他了解入侵古巴会引起热核灾难”。书中吹捧“肯尼迪在加勒比海危机最后阶段所起的作用”，“使他的声望升到了空前的高度”。“有一定的理由可以说，一九六三年是美国对外政策的转折点”。书中还吹捧“肯尼迪总统眼界宽阔，冷静地对待国际生活的迫切问题，愿意谋求某种同社会主义世界的‘临时协定’”。书中还引述了赫鲁晓夫在肯尼迪被刺丧命后打给约翰逊的电报中的话：“肯尼迪的逝世是对所有珍视和平与美苏合作事业的人的打击。”
    对于疯狂扩大侵越战争的美国现任总统约翰逊，书中说，他“是一个能在各种不同的政治派别中随机应变而不倾向于政治冒险的活动家”，他“很注意于履行自己的竞选诺言”。“在竞选运动期间，约翰逊非常坚决地主张和平共处，主张防止热核灾难，主张停止‘冷战’，主张彻底改善苏美关系”。书中说，美国“一九六四年的大选，成了对战争与和平问题的全民投票，而在这次全民投票中，约翰逊得到人民的绝对委任，去实现旨在巩固和平、消除‘冷战’、谋求苏美接近的政策”。书中还说什么“应该为约翰逊这位富有经验而且非常慎重而温和的政治家说句公道话：在一九六四年的竞选运动中，他至少是在对外政策方面接受了戈德华特的挑战，并且以多少明智一些的、现实主义的国际合作及缓和紧张局势的口号来对抗了政治冒险主义和好战的侵略性纲领”。
    书中对约翰逊寄予很大的希望，说“约翰逊和民主党将在一九六八年的大选中获得胜利。换言之，应该认为，在最近八年中（一九六四到一九七二年）美国对外政策的领导权将操在约翰逊和民主党手里。约翰逊在大选中获胜主要是由于他的对外政策纲领，他应许遵循已故肯尼迪总统的对外政策的方针”。
    此外，书中还吹捧美国现任国防部长麦克纳马拉“富有魄力”，甚至把臭名昭著的战争贩子麦克阿瑟美化为什么“温和、冷静、现实政策的拥护者”。书中还把美国现任副总统汉弗莱、参议院民主党领袖曼斯菲尔德和参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特等人美化为什么“国会中的‘左翼’自由派”，说他们常常“从左的方面对民主党政府外交活动进行批评”，“往往本着和平共处的精神提出缓和国际紧张局势的建议，并反对美国的侵略性挑衅行为”。
    歪曲马克思列宁主义的国家学说
    书中为了替所谓“温和的”、“头脑清醒的”美国总统在制定和执行对外政策上的“独立作用”制造理论根据，强调美国政府的“独立性”，实际上把国家说成是超阶级的。书中说，“对外政策在社会生活中所起的作用增长了，统治阵营中围绕着国际问题而进行的斗争尖锐化了，这些情况都进一步加强国家（例如总统，政府机构，特别是外交机构和军事机构）在制定和实行对外政策方针中的相对独立的作用”。
    书中诬蔑斯大林关于现代资产阶级国家服从垄断组织的马克思列宁主义原理，胡说斯大林的这种理论“轻视国家的作用，贬低国家的意义，否认国家具有一定的独立性和积极性，把国家贬低为某一个私人银行或托拉斯的奴仆”。
    宣扬苏美的“共同利益”和“友好合作传统”
    书中在描述苏美关系的“历史性质和历史传统”时写道：“美国和俄国曾经是由传统的友好和合作联系着的”，“除开一九一八年到一九二○年美国参加对苏俄的军事干涉这个污点之外，俄美和苏美关系没有为任何军事冲突和战争的乌云所笼罩。相反的，在第二次世界大战中，美国和苏联曾经是战友，这可以证明两国民族利益的共同性”。
    书中认为“苏美关系非常重要的特点”是：“就是在现在，两国之间并不存在任何领土的、经济的争执和冲突，它们的民族利益，无论是在全世界范围内，或者在任何局部地区的范围内，都没有互相冲突。”
    鼓吹苏美“和平共处”、“和平竞赛”
    书中说，“无论两个体系的对抗有多大，也有解决它的一把可靠的钥匙，就是列宁的天才的发现——和平共处原则”。书中说，“如果认识到热核战争的毁灭性而不容许热核战争发生，认识到和平共处作为国际生活的不可违反的准则是必需的，那么国际舞台上两种社会经济体系的竞赛和两个主要敌手的意识形态斗争，就将限定在没有流血冲突与战争的、广泛的经济、外交、科学和文化的竞赛与合作的范围之内”。
    书中迫切祈求扩大苏美贸易，实现苏美合作，说“一九六三年底，美国国会同意向苏联出售粮食并允许总统给予相应的贷款的决定，可以说是一个大有希望的开端”；又说，“一九六四年十一月，有九十二名美国银行及工业团体的著名活动家访问了莫斯科”后，“美国实业家们答应利用自己的影响使苏美经济联系正常化并扩大这种联系”。
    吹嘘苏美关系是“世界政治的轴心”
    这本书说，“苏美关系，世界两大最强国家的关系，是世界政治的轴心，是国际和平的主要基础”。书中引用美国国务卿腊斯克的话，强调“两大国——苏联和美国——对世界命运，对人类命运的特殊责任”。书中说，“用他的话说，两国领导人‘了解到苏联政府的任何一个首脑和美国的任何一个总统，由于必要而承担着保持普遍和平的特殊责任：可以毫不夸张地说，在当前的核世纪承担着维护北半球生存的责任’。说得很好。”
    书中说，苏联“致力于同美国的和平与合作，认为苏美关系是当代世界政治中的首要问题，是战争与和平问题的关键”。
    书中一再吹捧赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团实行苏美合作主宰世界的可耻行径。书中说，苏美英三国部分停止核试验条约的签订，“是美国政策上出现某种变化的标志”，“是在缓和国际紧张局势道路上的一个重要步骤，它表现出和平共处政策的生命力”，这个条约的签订是“全世界善良人们的巨大胜利”。

    B·A·瓦里科夫著
    苏联《科学》出版社一九六五年出版
    宣称苏联同美国全面合作的政策是不变的
    这本书说，“苏联共产党和苏联政府过去和现在一贯认为苏美关系的正常化具有头等重要的意义”。书中引用了苏共第二十一次代表大会对赫鲁晓夫报告的决议中的这一论点：“改善苏联和美国的关系，对于促进国际局势的健康发展，会起决定性的作用，因为苏联和美国是两个对普遍和平的命运负有特殊责任的国家。”
    书中强调说，“苏联旨在同美国建立全面合作的政策是不变的”。
    书中说，“苏维埃国家从其成立最初之日起就始终一贯地奉行同美国全面合作的方针”。“苏维埃国家从自己存在的最初之日起，就曾力求并且现在继续力求同美国建立事务合作和友好关系。苏维埃国家曾经一再提出关于建立正常的政治、经济、文化关系和发展全面合作的建议”。
    书中说，“一九一七至一九四一年苏美关系的历史令人信服地表明，苏联和美国之间的和平共处、友好合作，既符合苏联和美国人民的利益，也符合其他各国人民的利益”。
    宣扬美国统治集团愿意同苏联共处和合作
    这本书反复宣传“在美国过去发生作用和现在继续发生作用的有两种趋势”：一种是“实行公开反苏政策”的趋势，一种是“同苏联建立合作和发展同苏联的政治、经济、文化联系的趋势”。
    这本书说，“美国的许多国务活动家承认，象美国和苏联这样强大的国家，无论在战争年代，或者在战后时期，都能够共处和合作”。书中说，“第二次世界大战年代的苏美合作，为永远结束美国统治集团战前的不现实的和缺乏远见的对苏政策、为发展战后时期卓有成效的苏美关系，创造了有利的条件”。
    这本书赞扬美国统治集团中“比较有远见和头脑清醒的代表人物，都主张实行比较现实的对外政策，即不同社会经济制度国家和平共处的政策，主张寻求同苏联进行有效谈判的途径的政策。他们清楚地理解到，在现时的国际局势中，美国和苏联之间唯一可以接受的合作基础是和平共处及在经济、科学技术、文化和其他方面进行竞赛”。
     吹嘘苏美勾结联合行动的事实
    书中宣扬赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团直接向美国政府提出改善两国政治关系和经济关系的一系列建议，并且列举一九五九年以来苏美两国在联合国的联合行动，以及一系列相互勾结的事例，来证明必须实现苏美合作。
    书中说，“为联合国制定的关于全面彻底裁军决议的共同草案（一九五九年十一月），联合国关于为和平目的利用宇宙空间的共同决议（一九五九年十二月），苏美向第十六届联合国大会提出的关于裁军原则的共同提案，以及专为和平目的利用南极洲的协定，苏联科学院和美国国家航空与宇宙空间研究局之间于一九六三年六月八日缔结的关于宇宙的协定，都是苏美两国间可能进行事务合作的标志”。
    书中大肆吹嘘臭名远扬的部分停止核试验条约，说“一九六三年八月五日根据苏、美、英三国政府的协议在莫斯科签订的关于禁止在大气层、宇宙空间和水下试验核武器的条约，以及根据苏联和美国的相互谅解并在一九六三年十月第十八届联合国大会上一致通过的关于不把带有核武器或其他任何种类的大规模毁灭性武器的物体投入环绕地球的宇宙轨道的决议，在全世界得到重大的反应。这些决议符合全人类的利益，有助于缓和国际紧张局势和改善各国间，其中也包括苏美间的相互关系，为巩固不同社会经济制度国家间的相互信任，也就是说为采取新步骤来使国际空气健康化，创造了前提”。
    书中最后吹嘘说，苏美合作关系的发展，“不仅对苏美两国人民，而且对全人类的命运，都是生命攸关地必要的”。
