Title: The British Labour Government Besieged Internally and Externally

    The political climate in London has been very uneasy recently. People are looking back with frustration, anger, and bewilderment at the Labour government's record of failures over the past year and looking forward to the greater crises it faces in the new year.

    One issue that people are talking about is: What bad consequences has the Labour government's pursuit of the United States in international affairs brought to Britain in the past year? Many newspapers complain that Wilson's policies have increasingly reduced Britain to an "appendage of the United States," thereby lowering Britain's international status to "the lowest point to date."

    Serving the US Reputation in Disrepute

    The Labour government's pursuit of the United States is mainly manifested in its willingness to serve the US's aggressive policy on the Vietnam issue. It blatantly cheered for the United States to expand the war to North Vietnam, supported the United States' continuous increase of troops in South Vietnam to expand the war of aggression, and opposed the withdrawal of American troops. When the United States' policy of war blackmail was repeatedly frustrated and it was wantonly playing the trick of "unconditional discussions," the Labour government echoed and created various "peace" plans to run errands for the United States.

    The Wilson government works so hard for the United States mainly because it wants to rely on the economic and military support of the United States to maintain its declining status as a major power, and rely on collusion with the United States to maintain its crumbling colonial positions in the "East of Suez" region. However, contrary to expectations, the Labour government's support for the United States' aggression has been strongly condemned by the broad public at home and abroad, and its activities to peddle the US "peace talk" scams have been repeatedly frustrated, making it notorious. British newspapers pointed out that because the Labour government "has become increasingly subordinate to Washington and Wall Street," "Britain's opinion now does not count for much abroad."

    Failing to Please and Instead Being Squeezed

    However, what is particularly tragic is that although the Labour government serves the United States, the United States not only does not treat Britain differently, but takes advantage of Britain's decline to intensify its squeeze in all aspects. For example, during US Secretary of Defense McNamara's visit to London last November, he asked Britain to abandon its "independent nuclear force" to ease the sharp contradictions within the North Atlantic Group on the issue of nuclear armament. While the United States wants Britain to cooperate with the United States in shifting its strategic focus from Europe to Asia, it is cold to Britain's request for the United States to fund its military expenses in the "East of Suez" region. The United States is also intensifying its commodity exports and capital penetration to Britain and the Commonwealth countries. American newspapers even openly want Britain to abandon the Commonwealth and want the members of the Commonwealth to accept American hegemony. The Yorkshire Post complained in commenting on the current relationship between the United States and Britain: "In the past year, the Anglo-American relationship has been 'strengthened,' but...at the expense of British independence." The Scotsman also lamented that the special relationship that once existed between the United States and Britain has now "been put in the refrigerator."

    Colonial Policy Suffering a Miserable Defeat

    In the past year, the colonialist policies pursued by the Labour government to safeguard the interests of the British monopoly bourgeoisie, especially the policy of supporting the white colonial regime in Southern Rhodesia, have suffered a miserable defeat. Because the Wilson government condoned the Smith regime's unilateral "independence," more than 30 African countries unanimously passed a resolution condemning Britain's support for the Smith regime, and nine African countries severed diplomatic relations with Britain. The collapsing Commonwealth system has therefore suffered a great shock. In addition to severing diplomatic relations with Britain, some Commonwealth African member states have also announced that they are considering withdrawing from the Commonwealth. American journalist Gaver wrote in a dispatch from London sarcastically: "Today, it seems that the ties of the Commonwealth are more memories, ideals, principles, and words than material things."

    In addition, the South Yemeni people's anti-British patriotic struggle and the Asian people's struggle against the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia" have severely hit Britain's colonial positions in the "East of Suez" region. In this regard, The Economist magazine could not help but exclaim: "It is hard to imagine that British troops will still be stationed in Malaysia in ten or fifteen years, and Britain's days in Aden and the Persian Gulf may be even shorter."

    Economic Deterioration and Internal Strife

    Another problem that is giving the Labour government a headache is the deterioration of Britain's financial and economic situation. The pound crisis that broke out in November 1964 continues unabated. The measures taken by the government to tighten money supply in order to alleviate the pound crisis have brought about stagnation and decline in industrial production; and the government's practice of shifting financial and economic difficulties to the people has made inflation even more serious and further deepened the contradictions between the broad masses of working people and the ruling group. According to statistics, in the first ten months of last year, workers in various industries in Britain held 2,244 strikes to oppose rising prices and demand wage increases. At the beginning of the new year, workers' strikes followed one after another. The major strike of bakers has just ended, and railway workers will hold a nationwide strike in mid-February.

    The failure of the Labour government's internal and external policies and financial and economic difficulties have also deepened the contradictions within the British ruling group. The Conservative Party took the opportunity to launch a large-scale attack on the Labour Party, and disputes between various factions within the Labour Party have also repeatedly erupted. The Labour Party's already very fragile ruling position has become even more precarious. A few days ago, Wilson convened the cabinet and Labour Party leaders to study domestic and foreign policies and intra-party differences. In commenting on this meeting, British newspapers widely reported that the Labour government, which has only been in power for more than a year, may have to hold general elections this year before the political and economic situation further deteriorates, because if it drags on, the fate of the Labour government will be even less secure.

### 英国工党政府内外交困

    英国工党政府内外交困
    最近以来，伦敦的政治气候很不平静，人们以沮丧、恼怒和迷惘的情绪来回顾工党政府执政一年多的失败纪录和展望它在新的一年中面临的更大的危机。
    人们议论纷纷的一个问题是：工党政府一年多来在国际事务中追随美国给英国带来了什么恶果。许多报纸都抱怨威尔逊的政策使英国越来越沦为“美国的附庸”，从而使英国的国际地位下降到了“迄今为止的最低点”。为美效劳声名狼藉
    工党政府追随美国，集中表现为它在越南问题上甘愿为美国的侵略政策效劳。它明目张胆地为美国把战火扩大到越南北方摇旗呐喊，支持美国不断增兵南越扩大侵略战争，反对要美国军队撤出。当美国的战争讹诈政策连遭挫败，大肆玩弄“无条件讨论”的骗局的时候，工党政府应声而出，制造出各种各样的“和平”方案，为美国奔跑效劳。
    威尔逊政府这样为美国卖力，主要是想借助美国的经济和军事支持来保住它江河日下的大国地位，并且依靠同美国的勾结来维护它在“苏伊士以东”地区摇摇欲坠的殖民阵地。但是，事与愿违，工党政府支持美国侵略的作法，既遭到国内外广大公众的强烈谴责，它兜售美国“和谈”骗局的活动又到处碰壁，弄得自己声名狼藉。英国报纸指出，由于工党政府“变得越来越从属于华盛顿和华尔街”，“英国的意见现在在国外算不上一回事”。讨好不成反受挤压
    然而，尤其悲惨的是，尽管工党政府为美国效劳，美国却不但不对英国另眼看待，反而利用英国的衰落，从各个方面对它加紧挤压。例如，去年十一月间，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉访问伦敦时，就要英国放弃“独立核力量”，以缓和北大西洋集团在核武装问题上的尖锐矛盾。美国一面要英国配合美国把战略重点从欧洲转向亚洲，一面又对英国要美国资助它在“苏伊士以东”地区的军事费用表示冷淡。美国还向英国和英联邦国家加紧进行商品输出和资本渗透，美国报纸甚至公开要英国放弃英联邦，要英联邦的成员国接受美国霸权。《约克郡邮报》在评论美英目前的关系时抱怨说：“在过去的一年中，英美关系‘加强了’，但是……牺牲了英国的独立。”《苏格兰人报》也感叹说，美英之间曾经存在的特殊关系现在“已经被装入冰箱”。殖民政策遭到惨败
    在过去一年中，工党政府为了维护英国垄断资产阶级的利益而推行的殖民主义政策，特别是支持南罗得西亚白人殖民政权的政策，遭到了惨败。由于威尔逊政府纵容史密斯政权片面“独立”，三十多个非洲国家一致通过了谴责英国支持史密斯政权的决议，还有九个非洲国家断绝了同英国的外交关系。濒于瓦解的英联邦体系已经因此遭到很大震荡。有的英联邦非洲成员国除了同英国断交外，还宣布正在考虑退出英联邦。美国记者加弗向从伦敦发出的一篇专稿讽刺说：“今天看来，英联邦的纽带更多是回忆、理想、准则和言词，而不是物质上的东西。”
    此外，南也门人民的反英爱国斗争和亚洲人民反对新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”的斗争，沉重地打击了英国在“苏伊士以东”地区的殖民阵地。对此，《经济学家》杂志不禁惊呼：“很难想象，在十年或十五年以后还会有英国军队留在马来西亚，英国在亚丁和波斯湾的日子可能还会更短一些。”经济恶化内部纷争
    使工党政府焦头烂额的另一个问题，是英国财政经济状况的恶化。一九六四年十一月爆发的英镑危机延续不已。政府为缓和英镑危机而采取的抽紧银根的措施，又带来工业生产的停滞和下降；而政府向人民转嫁财政经济困难的作法，又使通货膨胀更加严重，并且进一步加深了广大劳动人民和统治集团之间的矛盾。据统计，在去年的头十个月中，英国各行各业的工人举行了二千二百四十四次罢工，反对物价上涨，要求增加工资。新年一开始，工人的罢工接踵而来，面包工人的大罢工刚刚结束，铁路工人又将在二月中旬举行全国性的大罢工。
    工党政府内外政策的失败和财政经济困难，也加深了英国统治集团内部的矛盾。保守党乘机大肆攻击工党，工党内部各派系之间也一再爆发争吵。工党本来就十分脆弱的统治地位已经更加岌岌可危。前些天，威尔逊召集内阁和工党头目，研究对内对外政策和党内分歧。英国报纸在评论这次会议时盛传，执政才一年多的工党政府，可能不得不抢在政治经济情况进一步恶化之前，在今年内举行大选，因为拖延下去，工党政府的命运就更不保险了。本报记者　王昌运（附图片）
