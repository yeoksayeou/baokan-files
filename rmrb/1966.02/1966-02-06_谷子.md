    Millet, also known as xiaomi, su, or huangsu, originated in China. It is one of the main grain crops planted in northern and northeastern China. The protein and fat content in millet are higher than that of rice and white flour. It also contains abundant vitamins A, B, and E, carbohydrates, and more calcium, phosphorus, iron and other minerals; besides being for human consumption, it can also be used for brewing. Millet stalks are a nutritious fodder, and millet bran is good feed for pigs and chickens.

    Millet likes warmth, is drought-resistant and barren-resistant, and has strong adaptability. It can be sown in spring and summer. The kernels are not easily moldy or infested with insects due to their hard outer shells, and can be stored for many years without spoiling. China's millet is mainly distributed in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces. As long as it is planted properly, millet can have a high yield. In recent years, many high-yield millet models have appeared in various places, proving that millet is not a low-yield crop. Preparing for war and famine for the people, we must develop millet production. In those days, the Chinese people relied on millet and rifles to defeat the enemy.

    谷子
    谷子又名小米、粟、黄粟。原产我国。是我国北方和东北地区种植的主要粮食作物之一。小米中的蛋白质和脂肪含量都高于大米和白面。它还含有丰富的甲、乙、戊种维生素、碳水化合物和较多的钙、磷、铁等矿物质；除供食用外，还可以酿酒。谷子的秸秆是一种营养丰富的饲草，谷糠是猪、鸡的良好饲料。
    谷子喜温暖，耐旱耐瘠，适应性强，可以春播和夏播。子粒因外壳坚硬，不容易发霉生虫，能贮藏多年不坏。我国的谷子主要分布在河北、山东、河南、山西、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、内蒙古、甘肃和陕西等地。只要种植得法，谷子能够有很高的产量。近年来，各地出现了许多个谷子高产典型，证明谷子并非低产作物。备战备荒为人民，要发展谷子生产，当年我国人民就是依靠小米加步枪战胜敌人的。
