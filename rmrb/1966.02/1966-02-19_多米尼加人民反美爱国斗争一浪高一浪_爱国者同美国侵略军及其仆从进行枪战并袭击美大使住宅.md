    Xinhua News Agency, Santo Domingo, 18th -- News: In Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, patriots repeatedly fired on the residence of the U.S. ambassador on the 17th and exchanged fire with the U.S. aggressors.
    Patriotic residents of Santo Domingo again engaged in gun battles on the 17th with U.S.-controlled "Pan-American Forces" and Dominican reactionary military police. Reports say that gunfire and bomb explosions could still be heard constantly throughout the night of the 16th and the day of the 17th.
    In the downtown area of Santo Domingo, patriotic residents also held demonstrations on the 17th to protest the bloody suppression by U.S. troops and Dominican reactionary military police and demanded the immediate expulsion of pro-U.S. right-wing military leaders from the Dominican Republic.
    According to reports, under strong pressure from the people, the Dominican puppet authorities were forced to decide on the evening of the 16th that pro-U.S. right-wing military leaders, former Army Chief of Staff Martinez Arana and former Air Force Commander Santos Cespedes, would leave the Dominican Republic. However, these two right-wing military leaders threatened that they would stay in the Dominican Republic. Reports say that the "Interim Government's" former Minister of Armed Forces, Caminero, who is stained with blood debts, had already slipped out of Santo Domingo to the United States on the night of the 11th.
    At the same time, the United States is plotting to further interfere in the Dominican Republic through its instrument of aggression—the Organization of American States. According to reports, an "emergency meeting" of the foreign ministers of the Organization of American States will be held in Washington on the 18th to discuss the "extremely serious situation in the Dominican Republic."
    Xinhua News Agency, 16th -- Santo Domingo News: Dominican patriots who have persisted in their struggle for a week again engaged in gun battles with U.S. aggressor troops in Santo Domingo, the capital, on the evening of the 15th.
    According to reports, on the Conde Avenue in downtown Santo Domingo that day, patriots exchanged fire with U.S. aggressors. They wounded two U.S. paratroopers with grenades. A few minutes before this battle occurred, patriotic snipers also attacked two jeeps patrolling by U.S. aggressors with fierce gunfire. The U.S. paratrooper units in the city hurriedly dispatched a large number of troops to "rescue" these attacked aggressors.
    Patriots also distributed anti-American and anti-tyranny leaflets on Conde Avenue, calling on people from all walks of life to continue to persist in the anti-American general strike. At present, almost all of Santo Domingo's industry and commerce are paralyzed, and public transportation in the city has come to a standstill.
    The general strike, which began on the evening of the 9th, has now expanded to ten cities. In Barahona, angry workers burned more than a thousand acres of sugarcane fields to protest the aggression of U.S. imperialism.
    According to reports, the continued development of the Dominican people's anti-American struggle has made the U.S. aggressors very alarmed. According to reports, the number of U.S. paratroopers in downtown Santo Domingo has doubled. In recent days, U.S. paratroopers and Dominican police have been searching for weapons among the people everywhere. The trembling U.S. aggressor troops have put on "bulletproof vests" and are also equipped with what are called "infrared" anti-sniper equipment, vainly attempting to prevent attacks by patriotic snipers.

    多米尼加人民反美爱国斗争一浪高一浪
    爱国者同美国侵略军及其仆从进行枪战并袭击美大使住宅
    新华社十八日讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加首都圣多明各爱国者十七日多次枪击美国大使的住宅，并且和美国侵略者交了火。
    圣多明各爱国居民十七日再次同美国控制的“泛美部队”和多米尼加反动军警进行了枪战。报道说，十六日整个晚上和十七日白天，仍然能够不断听到枪声和炸弹爆炸声。
    在圣多明各闹市区，爱国居民十七日还举行示威游行，抗议美军和多米尼加反动军警的血腥镇压，并且要求立即把亲美右派军事头目赶出多米尼加。
    据报道，在人民强大的压力下，多米尼加傀儡当局十六日晚上被迫决定：亲美右翼军事头目、前陆军参谋长马丁内斯·阿拉纳和前空军司令桑托斯·塞斯佩德斯将离开多米尼加。但是，这两个右派军事头目扬言，他们将赖在多米尼加不走。报道说，血债累累的“临时政府”前武装部部长卡米内罗已经在十一日夜间溜出圣多明各前往美国。
    与此同时，美国正在策划通过它的侵略工具——美洲国家组织来进一步干涉多米尼加。据报道，十八日将在华盛顿召开美洲国家组织外长“紧急会议”，来讨论“极其严重的多米尼加局势”。
    新华社十六日讯　圣多明各消息：已坚持了一个星期斗争的多米尼加爱国者十五日晚上在首都圣多明各再次同美国侵略军进行了枪战。
    据报道，当天，在圣多明各市区的孔德大街上，爱国者同美国侵略者交了火。他们用手榴弹炸伤了两名美国伞兵。在这次战斗发生前几分钟，爱国狙击手还用猛烈的枪火袭击了两辆美国侵略者巡逻的吉普车。市区里的美国伞兵部队急忙派出大批部队去“营救”这些被袭击的侵略者。
    爱国者还在孔德大街上散发反美抗暴的传单，号召各阶层人民继续坚持反美总罢工。目前，圣多明各的工商业几乎全部处于瘫痪状态，市区里的公共交通运输已经停顿。
    从九日晚上开始的总罢工现在已经扩展到十个城市。在巴拉奥纳市，愤怒的工人烧毁了一千多英亩的甘蔗田，抗议美帝国主义的侵略。
    据报道，多米尼加人民反美斗争的继续发展已经使得美国侵略者非常惊慌。据报道，在圣多明各市区，美国伞兵已经增加了一倍。连日来，美国伞兵和多米尼加警察到处搜查民间的武器。胆战心惊的美国侵略军都穿上了“防弹背心”，还配备了什么“红外线”反狙击装备，妄图防止爱国狙击手的袭击。
