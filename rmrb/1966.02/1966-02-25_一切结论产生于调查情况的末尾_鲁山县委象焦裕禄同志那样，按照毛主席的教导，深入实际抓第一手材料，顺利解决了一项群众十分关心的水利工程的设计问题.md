　　“All Conclusions Arise at the End of an Investigation”
    Lushan County Party Committee, Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, Following Chairman Mao's Teachings, Delved Deep into Reality to Grasp First-Hand Materials and Smoothly Solved a Design Problem for a Water Conservancy Project of Great Concern to the Masses
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st – Leading cadres of the CCP Lushan County Party Committee, connecting current realities with the study of Jiao Yulu, delved deep into the masses for investigation and research, and smoothly solved a water conservancy project problem of great concern to the masses.  When the main leading cadres of the County Party Committee were studying Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds, they were moved by his work style of delving deep into the masses to grasp first-hand materials. Recently, they led technicians, crossing mountains and ridges, walking more than eighty li, and visiting twelve production brigades in the Xinji District to listen to the opinions of the masses, changing the original plan to build a reservoir on the Dalang River to building a dam. After the construction of this dam, the irrigated area will be expanded by more than half, and a large amount of investment and man-hours can be saved.
    Xinji District is located in the hilly area of northeastern Lushan, with the Dalang River running through it.  The project of building the Dalang River Reservoir to irrigate the mountain fields here was surveyed and determined last winter.  However, due to the inconsistent opinions of the local masses on the original project plan, work could not begin.  The County Party Committee was also aware of these situations.  However, due to the lack of investigation, although there had been several discussions, a final decision on whether or not to build the reservoir could not be made.
    After the newspaper publishing Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds arrived in Lushan on February 7, the County Party Committee immediately carried out study and discussion. Everyone was not only inspired by Jiao Yulu's thorough revolutionary spirit, but Jiao Yulu's work style of delving deep into reality, delving deep into the masses for investigation and research, and grasping first-hand materials also gave everyone a very profound education.  Comparing themselves to Jiao Yulu, they conducted self-criticism, saying that because they did not deeply understand the actual situation like Jiao Yulu, they often lacked first-hand materials and could not make decisions on some major events related to changing the face of Lushan.  Like the major event of diverting water from the Dalang River up the mountain, the leading cadres of the County Party Committee did not personally weigh its importance like Jiao Yulu, so that construction could not begin for a long time.
    The more they studied Jiao Yulu's deeds, the more they realized that Chairman Mao's instructions on delving deep into reality for investigation and research were very correct.  Chairman Mao said: "If you cannot solve that problem, then you should investigate the current state of that problem and its history!  If you fully understand the investigation, you will have a solution to that problem.  All conclusions arise at the end of an investigation, not at its beginning."  After studying Jiao Yulu, comparing themselves and finding shortcomings, they were determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, immediately change their leadership style, personally investigate the disputed Dalang River Reservoir project, and then make arrangements.
    Early the next morning, the two secretaries of the County Party Committee, Yang Guodian and Wu Daozhen, led technicians, braving the snow, setting off, crossing more than twenty mountain peaks, and successively listening to the different opinions of many grassroots cadres and commune members on diverting water up the mountain.  Some said: The originally designed canal position is low, irrigates little land, and occupies a lot of land. Some said: The amount of water diverted is small, it is recommended to build some reservoirs and ponds along the canal for storage during normal times and for major use during droughts. Commune members near the reservoir were afraid that the reservoir would flood villages.  With these opinions, they came to the mountain top of Shuangtouwan Village, the originally designated reservoir site, spread out topographic maps on the spot, and carefully observed and analyzed, finding that the original reservoir project design did have many shortcomings: The reservoir position was too low, the construction investment was too high, several hundred mu of land would be occupied, and two villages would have to be relocated. Therefore, they proposed: change the plan to build a reservoir to building a dam; according to the need to divert water up the mountain, move the dam position three li away to Beidiantou Village. In this way, the natural elevation can be used, high dams do not need to be built, and the irrigated area can be expanded.
    That evening, Yang Guodian and other leading cadres came to Xinji, and convened a symposium overnight with the district party committee and the party secretaries of two nearby communes, handing over the investigated materials and the preliminary plan to change the design for them to discuss, and suggested that they compare it with the original reservoir design plan. After everyone compared it, they believed that building a dam was indeed better than building a reservoir. Building a dam, the terrain of the water diversion port is high, the main canal can be built on the mountainside, which not only occupies less arable land, but also realizes gravity irrigation, irrigating more than 20,000 mu; the original plan to build a nine-meter-high dam for the reservoir is no longer needed, only a two-meter-high dam needs to be built. The earth and stone works can be done by the masses themselves, which can save a lot of investment. After investigation and research, and repeated discussions with the masses and grassroots cadres, Yang Guodian and other leading cadres decided not to build a reservoir, but to build a dam. The masses expressed great satisfaction with this arrangement.
    In order to start construction of this project in a timely manner, the County Party Committee immediately sent Xinji District Party Committee Secretary Wang Tingdong and technicians to carry dry food up the mountain, survey the route of the water diversion canal section by section.
    Currently, the benefiting communes and teams in this area have organized labor to quarry stones and prepare materials, build kilns and burn lime, and are actively preparing for the construction of the dam. Several benefiting teams in Liangwa Commune have automatically undertaken the task of building the dam. (Attached picture)
    After studying the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, cadres above the regimental level of the Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army held discussions, expressing that they must fight for the revolution for a lifetime like Comrade Jiao Yulu.

### “一切结论产生于调查情况的末尾”  鲁山县委象焦裕禄同志那样，按照毛主席的教导，深入实际抓第一手材料，顺利解决了一项群众十分关心的水利工程的设计问题

　　“一切结论产生于调查情况的末尾”
    鲁山县委象焦裕禄同志那样，按照毛主席的教导，深入实际抓第一手材料，顺利解决了一项群众十分关心的水利工程的设计问题
    新华社郑州二十一日电  中共河南鲁山县委的领导干部，联系当前实际学习焦裕禄，深入群众调查研究，顺利地解决了群众十分关心的一项水利工程问题。县委的主要领导干部在学焦裕禄的光辉事迹时，被他那深入群众抓第一手材料的工作作风所感动，最近带领技术人员，翻山越岭，步行八十多里，走访辛集区十二个生产大队，听取群众意见，把原来在大狼河上修建水库的计划改为修建拦河坝。这个拦河坝修成后，将使灌溉面积扩大一半多，并可以节省大量的投资和工时。
    辛集区位于鲁山东北部的丘陵地带，大狼河穿境而过。在这里修建大狼河水库浇灌山田的工程，在去年冬天就已勘测确定下来。但是由于当地群众对原定的工程计划意见不一致，未能动工。这些情况，县委也有所了解，只因缺乏调查，虽然讨论过几次，对修不修这座水库都未能作出最后决定。
    二月七日刊登焦裕禄光辉事迹的报纸到达鲁山后，县委立即进行了学习讨论。大家不光为焦裕禄的彻底革命精神所激励，焦裕禄深入实际深入群众调查研究、掌握第一手资料的作风，也给大家以很深刻的教育。他们对照焦裕禄自我检查说，由于对实际情况未能象焦裕禄那样深知深解，对一些关系到改变鲁山面貌的大事，常因缺少第一手资料，下不了决心。象引大狼河水上山这件大事，县委领导干部就没有象焦裕禄那样，亲自去掂一掂它的分量，以致迟迟不能动工兴修。
    他们越是学习焦裕禄的事迹，越体会到毛主席关于深入实际调查研究的指示非常正确。毛主席说：“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！你完完全全调查明白了，你对那个问题就有解决的办法了。一切结论产生于调查情况的末尾，而不是在它的先头。”经过学习焦裕禄，对照找差距，他们决心按照毛主席的指示去做，立即改变领导作风，对争论中的大狼河水库工程问题，亲自去调查，而后做出安排。
    第二天一早，县委两个书记杨国殿、吴道真便带领技术人员冒雪出发，翻越二十多座山头，先后听取了许多基层干部和社员对引水上山的不同意见。有的说：原设计渠位低，浇地少，占地多。有的说：引水量小，建议沿渠修些库塘，平时存蓄，旱天大用。临近水库的社员则怕修水库淹了村庄。带着这些意见，他们又来到原定库址的双头湾村山头上，就地展开地形图，进行仔细观察分析，发现原水库工程设计确有许多不足之处：水库位置太低，修建投工多，还要占用几百亩地，要迁移两个村庄。因此，他们便提出：把修水库的计划改成修拦河坝；按引水上山的需要，把建坝位置上移到三里之外的北店头村。这样，就可以利用自然地势的拔海高程，不需要修高坝，又能扩大灌溉面积。
    当天晚上，杨国殿等领导干部来到辛集，连夜召集区委和附近两个公社的党委书记开座谈会，把调查得来的资料和改变设计的初步方案交给他们讨论，建议他们和原水库设计方案作比较。大家比较以后，认为拦河修坝确实比修水库好。修拦河坝，引水口地形高，干渠可以修在山腰坡顶，既少占耕地，又能实行自流灌溉，多浇两万多亩；原计划修水库需要九米高的大坝也不用修了，只要修两米高的拦水坝就行。土石方工程，群众可以自办，能够节省大量投资。杨国殿等领导干部经过调查研究，反复和群众、基层干部商量以后，确定不再修建水库，而修建拦河坝。群众对这样安排，表示非常满意。
    为了使这项工程及时开工兴建，县委紧接着派辛集区委书记王庭栋和技术员一起，背上干粮上山，逐段勘察，测定引水渠线。
    目前，这个地区的各受益社队已经组织劳动力开石备料，建窑烧石灰，为修建拦河坝积极做准备。梁洼公社的几个受益队自动承担了修建拦河坝的任务。（附图片）
