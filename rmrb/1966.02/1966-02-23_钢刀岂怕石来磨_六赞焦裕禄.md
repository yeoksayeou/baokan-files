　　A Steel Knife Fears No Stone Grinding
　　Six Praises for Jiao Yulu
　　Lu Xianrong
    A steel knife, why fear being ground by stone? Not only is it not afraid, but it also welcomes and loves being ground. Grinding removes rust and prevents dullness; grinding makes it bright and sharp.
    If you are as firm as a steel knife, then difficulties in your eyes are merely whetstones; the greater the difficulty, the higher the quality of the whetstone. You would not only be unafraid of difficulties, but you would also develop a special love for them, seek them out specifically, and grind with them constantly. If you are as soft as a piece of tofu, then difficulties become the stubborn rocks you fear most; at the sight of them, you would retreat three times and flee far away.
    Difficulties are such a fair test of everyone: whether one is hard or soft; whether one is a steel knife or tofu; whether one is a true revolutionary or a fake revolutionary.
    Our beloved Comrade Jiao Yulu, in the face of immense difficulties, proved to be a shining revolutionary steel knife. Waterlogging, wind, sand, and alkali, in his eyes, were nothing more than whetstones. When the wind and sand were at their worst, he insisted on investigating the wind gaps and exploring the quicksand; when the rain was at its heaviest, he insisted on observing the floods and examining the currents; when heavy snow blocked the doors, he insisted, despite severe liver pain, on visiting the most impoverished masses to express his concern, without even warming himself by their fire or drinking a drop of their water... He was so tough: specifically seeking out difficulties to grind himself.
    However, even a steel knife, when grinding against the whetstone of difficulties, must not grind blindly or haphazardly if it wishes to become bright and sharp; it must also pay attention to the art of grinding. Comrade Jiao Yulu not only knew how to use whetstones, but he was also proficient in the art of sharpening knives. Look, this is how he ground: resolutely grasping the revolutionization of the county committee leadership, personally conducting in-depth investigations, actively establishing model examples, conscientiously acting as the "squad leader" – it was precisely because he ground so skillfully and so artistically that his steel knife was ground so brightly and so quickly.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's proletarian revolutionary steel knife was forged from a heart of utter devotion to the revolution and the people, tempered in the crucible of Mao Zedong Thought, and forged in the fires of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation. The more such a revolutionary steel knife is ground, the brighter its revolutionary thought; the more it is ground, the stronger its revolutionary will; the more it is ground, the sharper its revolutionary spirit; the more it is ground, the more abundant its revolutionary wisdom. It has become a formidable steel knife in the hands of the proletariat, opening mountains and paving roads, seizing passes and capturing strongholds: wherever it cuts, it splits in two; wherever it chops, it turns to mud. Our revolutionary cause needs thousands upon thousands of such revolutionary steel knives that never lose their edge.

　　钢刀岂怕石来磨
　　六赞焦裕禄
　　陆先荣
    钢刀，岂怕石来磨？不仅不怕，还愿意磨，喜爱磨。磨，才能去锈、防钝；磨，才能明亮，锋利。
    你，如若坚如一把钢刀，那么，困难在你眼中，只能是一块磨刀石；困难愈大，只不过说明此磨刀石的质量愈高而已。你，就不仅不怕困难，而且还会对它产生一种特殊的爱，专门找它，常和它磨。你，如若软似一块豆腐，那么，困难就成了你最害怕碰上的顽石；一见到它，就会退避三舍，逃之夭夭。
    困难，就是这么公正地检验着每一个人：是硬，是软；是钢刀，是豆腐；是真革命，还是假革命。
    我们敬爱的焦裕禄同志，在重重困难面前，被证明是一把亮闪闪的革命的钢刀。内涝、风沙、盐碱，在他眼里，只不过是一块块磨刀石。风沙最大的时候，他偏偏在此时去查风口，探流沙；雨最大的时候，他偏偏在此时去观洪水，察流势；逢大雪封门的时候，他偏偏在此时，忍受肝部剧痛，到最困难的群众家里去问寒问暖，而且还不烤群众一把火，不喝群众一口水……。他，就是这么硬：专找困难磨。
    但，即使是一把钢刀，在和困难——磨刀石相磨时，要想磨得明亮，锋利，也不可瞎磨乱磨，还必须讲究点磨的艺术。焦裕禄同志，不仅会利用磨刀石，而且也精通磨刀术。看，他是这么磨的：狠抓县委领导革命化，亲自深入调查，积极树立样板，认真当好“班长”——正因为他磨得如此高明，磨得如此艺术，所以他这把钢刀才磨得那么亮，那么快。
    焦裕禄同志这把无产阶级的革命钢刀，是由一心为革命、一心为人民的赤胆忠心所铸，在毛泽东思想熔炉里冶炼，在阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的烈火中锻成。这样的革命钢刀，越磨，革命思想越亮；越磨，革命意志越坚；越磨，革命精神越锐；越磨，革命智谋越多。成了无产阶级手中一把劈山开路、夺关斩将的铮铮钢刀：砍到那里，那里两半；剁到那里，那里成泥。我们的革命事业，需要千千万万把这样革命的、永不卷刃的钢刀。
