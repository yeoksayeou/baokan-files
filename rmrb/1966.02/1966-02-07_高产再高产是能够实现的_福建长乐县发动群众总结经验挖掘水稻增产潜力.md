    Higher Yields and Still Higher Yields Are Achievable
    —Changle County, Fujian Province, Mobilizes the Masses to Summarize Experiences and Tap the Potential for Increasing Rice Production
    The Changle County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Fujian Province, combining the spirit of continuous revolution with a scientific attitude, relies on the masses and mobilizes the masses to farm for the revolution and farm scientifically, enabling the county to achieve bumper harvests of grain crops for three consecutive seasons in 1965, with the total annual grain output increasing by more than 20% compared to the previous year. The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently called on all parts of the province to learn from Changle and strive for an even greater harvest this year.
    Changle County is located on the south bank of the Min River estuary, backing mountains and facing the sea, belonging to a semi-plain and semi-hilly area. The county mainly cultivates rice and is one of the main grain-producing counties in Fujian Province.
    The county has a total of more than 270,000 mu of cultivated land, of which more than 190,000 mu are paddy fields, and the rest are dry land. Since liberation, especially since the people's communes, the people of the county have engaged in large-scale farmland capital construction, with the main contents being water conservancy construction and the transformation of low-yielding fields, making 200,000 mu of cultivated land basically drought-resistant and flood-resistant, stable and high-yielding. In 1964, the average yield per mu of grain in the county greatly exceeded the targets set by the "National Agricultural Development Program."
    Grain production was already quite high. Was it necessary to further develop grain production, and was it possible to achieve higher yields and still higher yields? After the autumn of 1964, the Changle County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party raised this question when discussing the production plan for 1965. At that time, one view held that the state still had a great need for grain and it was necessary to further increase production, advocating raising the multiple cropping index, expanding the wheat planting area, and changing from two crops a year to three crops a year. Another view held that the yield per mu was already very high, almost at its limit, and there was no need to plant too much winter wheat. In addition, some rice fields did not have the habit of planting wheat, and "planting wheat harms rice" was not cost-effective; "three times three equals nine is not as good as two times five equals ten." Originally, in Changle County, only sweet potatoes were planted on dry land, while winter wheat and barley were planted in paddy fields. After harvesting the wheat, two crops of early and late rice were planted. In 1964, the county had already developed more than 50,000 mu of spring-harvested wheat crops. Should the winter planting area in 1964 be increased? Could it be increased? Opinions differed during the discussion. Therefore, the county committee, taking this question, went deep down to consult with grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants. Most of the grassroots cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants, seeing that many production teams had increased production by increasing wheat planting, advocated planting more wheat, expressing that as long as they could increase one season of grain, they would definitely do it, even if it was a little harder and more tiring.
    The winter planting area was to be expanded. How could it be ensured that planting wheat would not harm rice? The county committee further investigated and studied, mobilized the masses, and summarized the experiences of some places in achieving double harvests of rice and wheat. The Panye Brigade of the Chengguan Commune had an average yield of 280 jin per mu of spring wheat last year and an average yield of 847 jin per mu of early rice. The key to achieving bumper harvests in both seasons was to seize the season, apply sufficient fertilizer, and manage it well. As long as this was done, planting wheat would not harm rice. However, this was only the experience of one brigade. To achieve triple harvests of rice and wheat throughout the county, were there no problems or difficulties? Therefore, the county committee convened a meeting and invited poor and lower-middle peasant commune members to offer suggestions. These commune members put forward many good methods, such as expanding the planting of green manure, increasing fertilizer accumulation, and how to accumulate and apply fertilizer, solving many difficulties that the county committee had previously thought were unsolvable. Many poor and lower-middle peasants not only made many suggestions at the meeting, but also took the lead in going to work, taking the lead in handing in fertilizer, taking the lead in promoting new technologies, and taking the lead in fighting hard battles. By relying on the masses, the county not only completed the winter planting plan of more than 87,000 mu of wheat and barley with quality and quantity, but also expanded the sowing area of green manure crops by 80% compared to the previous year. At the same time, they also dug river mud, accumulated sea fertilizer, and collected wild green manure, significantly increasing the fertilizer prepared for rice compared to the previous year.
    With fertilizer, would the yield of early rice increase? Some cadres and commune members lacked confidence, saying that it was easy to increase by 100 jin, but difficult to add another 10 jin. The yield of early rice had already been very high in the past, and it would be difficult to increase it further! At this time, the county committee organized cadres, party members, and poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's articles such as "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," enhancing everyone's understanding and overcoming the fear of difficulties. At the same time, more than 20 county committee members went to production teams to investigate and study, summarizing the experiences of several teams that had achieved particularly significant increases in early rice production in 1964, using vivid facts to educate cadres and the masses. Relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, extensively mobilizing the masses, vigorously promoting the significance of "farming for the revolution"; organizing a total of more than 200 cadres at the county, commune, and team levels to study at advanced units such as the Yinxi Brigade of the Yinxi Commune in Fuqing County, a national model of Dazhai-style agriculture; and carrying out mass summary and learning activities throughout the county to promote the experience of planting good short-stalk varieties and continuous cropping rice. The revolutionary spirit of the broad masses was greatly promoted, and they found methods in summarizing and learning, immediately setting off a production upsurge.
    In the process of early rice production, the county committee adopted the method of combining leading cadres, technicians, and peasant masses, setting up points by area and creating models at all levels. During each key period of production, the model fields at all levels took the lead, setting an example and driving the overall effort. During the growth period of early rice, the county committee successively convened six "three-way combination" on-site meetings to exchange relevant technical measures, promoting communes and production teams to use advanced methods to plant and manage early rice. As a result, the average yield per mu of 170,000 mu of early rice in the county increased by more than 100 jin compared to the previous year.
    When the spring-harvested wheat and barley and other crops achieved increased production, and a bumper harvest of early rice was already a foregone conclusion, some cadres and masses became complacent. In addition, because rice production had always been "high early and low late" in recent years, some people believed that late rice was a "predestined" low-yielding crop, so the enthusiasm for striving for increased late rice production declined. Grasping this idea, the county committee emphasized that production should continue to increase, and the human factor was the first; the revolution should be thorough, not half-hearted; they should be masters of nature, not slaves of nature; they should create socialist undertakings, not maintain the status quo; they should advance in the face of difficulties, not retreat in the face of difficulties. It also widely mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of increasing late rice production in recent years from the bottom up. In this activity, the county committee found that some communes and production teams used short-stalk early rice varieties as late rice varieties, implementing "reverse planting of spring," and late rice had achieved high yields for several consecutive years. Therefore, the county committee decided to promote "reverse planting of spring." Subsequently, the county committee, through extensive investigation and consultation with the masses, determined to use Pearl Dwarf as the main variety for "reverse planting of spring." On this basis, the county committee again boldly mobilized the masses, allowing the masses to decide for themselves the area to be planted with "Pearl Dwarf" using "reverse planting of spring." The principle was to plant more where thoughts were clear and people were willing to plant; those who still had concerns should plant a little less for experimentation. In this way, the area of late rice with "reverse planting of spring" in the county reached more than 63,000 mu. Because the "Pearl Dwarf" with "reverse planting of spring" had a high yield, it increased the average yield per mu of late rice in the county, increasing the total output of late rice in the county by more than 10% compared to the previous year.
    Currently, the Changle County Committee is summarizing the experiences of 1965 and further mobilizing the masses to strive for an even greater harvest this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    高产再高产是能够实现的
    ——福建长乐县发动群众总结经验挖掘水稻增产潜力
    中共福建省长乐县委把不断革命精神和科学态度结合起来，依靠群众、发动群众，为革命种田，用科学种田，使全县一九六五年的粮食作物连续三季获得丰收，全年粮食总产量比上年增加两成多。中共福建省委最近号召全省各地向长乐学习，为争取今年更大丰收而斗争。
    长乐县在闽江口南岸，背山面海，属于半平原半丘陵地带。全县以种植水稻为主，是福建省的主要产粮县之一。
    这个县共有耕地二十七万多亩，其中有十九万多亩是水田，其余的是旱地。解放后，特别是人民公社化以来，全县人民以兴修水利和改造低产田为主要内容，大搞农田基本建设，使二十万亩耕地基本上实现了旱涝保收，稳产高产。一九六四年全县粮食平均亩产量大大超过了“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标。
    粮食产量相当高了，要不要再发展粮食生产，能不能实现高产再高产？一九六四年秋后，中共长乐县委讨论一九六五年的生产时，提出了这个问题。当时，一种意见认为，国家对粮食还非常需要，必须进一步增加生产，主张提高复种指数，扩大种麦面积，变两熟为三熟，一种意见却认为，亩产量很高，已经差不多了，冬种何必太多，加之部分稻田没有种麦习惯，“种麦损稻”不上算，“三三见九，不如二五得十”。原来，长乐县的旱地只种甘薯，冬小麦和大麦都种在水田里，收了麦子，再种早、晚两季稻。一九六四年全县春收麦类作物已经发展到五万多亩。三熟田面积的扩大，是这个县一九六四年单产上升的重要因素之一。一九六四年的冬种面积要不要增加？能不能增加？讨论时意见不一。因此，县委便带着这个问题，分头深入下去，同基层干部和贫下中农商量。绝大部分基层干部和贫下中农因为看到许多生产队由于增种小麦获得了增产，都主张要多种小麦，表示只要能增产一季粮食，就是苦一点、累一点，也一定要干。
    冬种面积要扩大，如何能做到种麦不损稻呢？县委又进一步调查研究，发动群众，总结了一些地方稻麦双丰收的经验。城关公社泮野大队，去年春小麦平均亩产二百八十斤，早稻平均亩产八百四十七斤。两季都丰收，关键在于抓紧季节，上足肥料，管得好。只要这样做，种麦并不会损稻。但是这只是一个大队的经验，要做到全县稻麦三丰收，是不是没有问题、没有困难呢？因此，县委又召开会议，请贫农下中农社员出主意。这些社员提出了扩种绿肥、增积肥料和如何积肥、施肥等许多好办法，解决了县委许多原先觉得无法解决的困难。许多贫下中农不仅在会上提出了许多建议，而且回去后还带头出工，带头交肥，带头推广新技术，带头打硬仗。由于依靠了群众，全县不仅按质按量完成了八万七千多亩大小麦的冬种计划，绿肥作物播种面积也比上年扩大了百分之八十。同时，又大挖河泥、大积海肥、多采野生绿肥，为水稻准备的肥料，比上年显著增加。
    肥料有了，早稻产量是不是就能上去？一部分干部、社员却没有信心，他们说，增百容易添十难。过去早稻产量已经很高，再上去就难啦！这时，县委就组织干部、党员、贫下中农学习毛主席的《将革命进行到底》《愚公移山》等几篇文章，提高了大家的认识，克服了畏难情绪。同时，二十多个县委委员分头到生产队去调查研究，总结一九六四年早稻增产特别显著的几个队的经验，用活的事实来教育干部、群众。依靠贫下中农，广泛发动群众，大力宣传“种田为革命”的意义；组织县、社、队三级干部共二百多人，到全国大寨式农业典型福清县音西公社音西大队等先进单位去学习；并在全县范围内开展群众性的总结、学习活动，推广种好矮秆良种和连作稻的经验。广大群众革命精神大为发扬，又在总结、学习中找到了办法，立即掀起了生产高潮。
    在早稻生产过程中，县委采取了领导干部、技术员和农民群众三结合的办法，按片设点，层层搞样板，在各个生产的关键时期，各级的样板田都先走一步，做出样子，带动全面。在早稻生长期间，县委先后召开了六次“三结合”现场会，交流有关技术措施，推动各公社生产队用先进的办法种、管早稻，结果全县十七万亩早稻，平均亩产量比上年增长了一百多斤。
    当春收的大、小麦等获得增产，早稻丰收已成定局的时候，有些干部和群众又产生了自满情绪，再加上这几年水稻产量一直是“早高晚低”，一些人认为晚稻是“命中注定”的低产作物，因此，争取晚稻增产的干劲下降了。县委抓住这种思想，强调生产要继续上去，人的因素第一；要彻底革命，不要革一半；要做大自然的主人，不要做大自然的奴隶；要创社会主义之业，不能守业；要知难而进，不能知难而退。并且广泛发动群众，自下而上地总结这几年的晚稻增产经验。在这项活动中，县委发现有些公社生产队把矮秆良种早稻当晚稻种，实行“倒种春”，晚稻连续几年获得高产。于是县委决定推广“倒种春”。接着，县委又通过多方调查，广泛同群众商量，确定以珍珠矮作为“倒种春”的主要良种。在这个基础上，县委又放手发动群众，由群众自己决定采用“珍珠矮”实行“倒种春”的面积，原则是思想通的愿种的多种；还有顾虑的，就少种一点，进行试验。这样，全县“倒种春”的晚稻面积共达六万三千多亩。由于“倒种春”的“珍珠矮”产量高，就提高了全县晚稻平均单产水平，使全县晚稻总产量比上年增长一成多。
    目前，长乐县委正在总结一九六五年的经验，进一步发动群众，为争取今年获得更大丰收而努力。　（据新华社讯）
