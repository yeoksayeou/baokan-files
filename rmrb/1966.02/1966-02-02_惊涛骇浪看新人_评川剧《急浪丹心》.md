    New Talents Seen in the Midst of Turbulent Waves
    —A Review of the Sichuan Opera "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents"
    Liu Housheng
    The Sichuan Opera "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" is a good play with original achievements in stage art. In terms of dramatic literature, "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" has some shortcomings, but it is basically good. It has made some experiments in dramatic style and acquired some experience, which is also worth exploring.
    In "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents," people use pseudonyms, but the events are real. It actually depicts real people and real events. In the past, there was a debate about whether real people and real events could be written into plays. Generally speaking, writing plays using real people and real events has greater limitations, making it difficult to generalize and typify, which is more troublesome. However, judging from the practice of dramatic creation in recent years, it would also become a kind of restriction if this statement is absolutized.
    "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" tells the story of He Zhongmin, an old boatman on the Sichuan River, who abandoned his son to save the boat when his boat encountered danger in a dangerous shoal, in order to ensure the safety of all the boatmen, national materials, and the following fleet. It seems to be a very difficult struggle between man and nature to stage. But "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" handles it very well. The author writes about the struggle between man and nature, but more importantly, uses the struggle between man and nature as a background, and writes about the contradictions of different thoughts of people. The characters in the play are all positive characters, but they have different opinions on how to deal with the threats of floods and dangerous shoals. In the final analysis, it is still a contradiction between correct and incorrect, advanced and backward. This constitutes the conflict of the whole play, and constitutes a play that has educational significance and can move people.
    Due to the limitations of real people and real events, the whole play seems to lack a consistent conflict. The first half's several conflicts (mainly the conflict of whether to save Hongsheng) are resolved immediately after they occur; the second half turns to the conflict of whether Hongsheng can be found. Therefore, the entire play lacks repeated entanglements and step-by-step development in the structure of conflict. This is a weakness. Nevertheless, these seemingly unconnected conflicts still have their internal connections: He Zhongmin has the idea of ​​withdrawing the boat to give way to the canal and helping brother boats, and at a critical moment, he will also have the idea of ​​abandoning his son to save the boat. The coherence of the plot is not strong, but the coherence of thought is very clear; the organic development of dramatic action is not enough, but the character's personality is revealed in these individual conflicts. At the end of the "Fighting the Shoal" scene, when Hongsheng fell into the water and the boatmen wanted to save him, He Zhongmin suppressed his pain and roared in white: "Don't move! Saving the boat is important, don't care about the child. Use the stern as the rudder (at this time the rudder is broken), be calm. Push the oars!" These decisive words show his heroic socialist spirit and generous proletarian spirit! We feel the solemnity of a warrior's character standing like a high mountain in the turbulent waves, and reveal He Zhongmin's highest ideological realm. In this way, although "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" has a relatively simple plot, several conflicts seem relatively isolated, and the second half lacks development, however, through these specific actions, He Zhongmin's loyal, enthusiastic, selfless, and wholehearted revolutionary, strong and firm heroic image is portrayed quite prominently. And his character obviously typically embodies the common thoughts and feelings of the dozen or so people on the same boat and the vast number of Sichuan River boatmen.
    The achievement of "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" in stage art is even more prominent. With the director as the main focus, whether it is performance, stage art, or music, it is very creative. This creativity is prominently manifested in the fact that directors and actors, etc., on the basis of life, make flexible use of tradition, while absorbing new artistic elements, and deliberately pursue a formal beauty with national style. Formal beauty is by no means formalistic "beauty." Formalistic "beauty" must be opposed, but formal beauty that serves ideological content and serves to shape heroic images is the more beautiful the better. The more beautiful the form, the more it can express the beauty of the content, and only then can it be more attractive and infectious, guiding the audience to understand the ideological content more deeply.
    The stage background is beautiful. The designer is very ingenious. On a monochrome sky curtain, either bright red or sky blue, he uses the simplest white lines to draw the outlines of clouds, sun, pine trees, distant mountains, nearby water, huge waves, and other scenery. The color is bright and the momentum is bold. Although the environment of cliffs and dangerous shoals is not highlighted enough, the vastness of the Jialing River during the flood season is expressed very artistically, dotting the beautiful mountains and rivers of our motherland. Such a scene has both decorative meaning and can echo the emotions of the characters in the play; it both indicates the location and has room for maneuver; it has both the brushstrokes of national painting and the practical feeling of life. It is very harmonious with the singing and dancing style of the whole play and can serve the theme and performance very well.
    The costumes are beautiful. The young boatmen's uniform blue short-sleeved jackets, tightly tied with yellow belts, and open chests revealing a large "Award" character in the red vest, are very ideological, indicating that this is an advanced collective. Dark straw shoes are also embellished with a pompom. When pulling the towline on the shore, they also wear a light yellow straw hat. These all come from life and have been refined and beautified. It gives people a sense of neatness, strength, harmony, and beauty. But it is not monotonous, because suddenly a white-shirted Young Pioneer with a red scarf appears after the boatmen, making the whole color more lively; the last He Zhongmin comes out with a larger short jacket added to the boatman's costume, showing the composure of the helmsman. This is a very successful costume design.
    The singing tunes and the actors' voices are also beautiful. Xie Zhengxin, who plays He Zhongmin, Wang Qijiu, who plays Du Tanshi, Ren Tingfang, who plays Zhou Dagang, and Wang Daiquan, the female lead singer of the accompaniment team, all have good voices, with wide ranges and thick voices, coupled with the majestic male chorus, which can well show the spirit of the Sichuan River boatmen. A large number of Sichuan River boatmen's chants are absorbed and combined well with the Sichuan Opera singing. In the first three scenes, all the singing is done by men, but the accompaniment is sung by women with a rich tone; in several places, such as the duet between He Zhongmin and Du Tanshi in the second scene, string music is added to the high-pitched percussion music, which makes the play add some gentle colors to the roughness, which is very beautiful.
    The most beautiful is the dance. "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" greatly improves the role of dance elements in the tradition of combining song, dance, and drama in our national opera. It greatly develops the song and dance drama style in opera and creates a very good experience for expressing the theme of the struggle between man and nature on the stage.
    The theme of the struggle between man and nature can be said to be a difficult problem on the drama stage. In "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents," He Zhongmin and the boatmen pulling the towline, steering, paddling, and punting in the wind and waves are full of large-scale action changes in life, which can completely become the material for dance creation. Without drastic changes in dance movements, such a play would be difficult to establish. Taking the struggle between man and nature as the subject of opera, the ideological conflict between characters must be grasped in the structural development of the conflict, while the role of dance needs to be fully utilized in artistic expression methods. This is not only for the beautification of dramatic action, but more importantly, only in this way can the complexity and difficulty of the struggle between man and nature be more forcefully and meticulously reflected, so that the seemingly simple conflict can show its serious and profound significance, and the character of the hero (individual or collective) can be more brilliantly portrayed. This experience may not be applicable to all themes of the struggle between man and nature, nor to general dramas, but at least it is very important for operas like "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents."
    The dance elements in our traditional opera are manifested on the one hand in the moderate beautification of certain actions in daily life such as going upstairs and downstairs, opening and closing doors, threading needles, etc.; on the other hand, they are manifested in the expression of certain strong emotions, such as shaking hair, stroking beard, kneeling, etc., and more abundantly in battle dances. There are very few dances that express labor, and even fewer dances that praise labor. In the first scene of "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents," a group of boatmen enter the stage pulling the towline, which naturally reminds us of the boatmen of old China. They pull the towline in the same way, but they pull the exploitation towline and walk the road to death. "The water in the Jialing River is the blood and tears of the boatmen." But now, what we see is also pulling the towline, but it shows the strength of the proletariat and the strength of socialist youth. The boatmen are also crawling forward, even lying on the ground with their whole bodies, but their faces are full of joy for transporting wealth for socialism, and they are radiant with the brilliance of socialist masters. Their dance movements are not complicated, but they have distinct edges and corners, a strong sense of rhythm, and show the joy of labor everywhere, the infinite power of man in the struggle against nature, and the high-spirited spirit of the times.
    As a dramatic dance, "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" not only praises labor, but also shapes characters and expresses ideas through characters. This is a group of ordinary boatmen, but also a group of heroic boatmen, so the dance must show their heroic spirit. The third scene, "Fighting the Shoal," does this most heartily. When He Zhongmin shouted "Comrades, prepare to enter the shoal!" Immediately, the paddling action became faster and faster, and all the boatmen entered a tense atmosphere. However, just when the entire stage seemed to need to rely on more people to create a more tense atmosphere, the stage moved forward like a push shot in a movie, and two rows of paddling boatmen gradually disappeared outside the stage, leaving only He Zhongmin standing out at the stage entrance. The helmsman is the soul of the entire boat. Although there is only one person on the stage, his actions and thoughts concentrate on showing the common demands of all the boatmen. Therefore, we feel that the stage is very full, and his strength alone weighs more than a thousand pounds. The image of the hero is established due to the hero's actions, and the hero's thoughts are embodied due to the hero's image.
    As a song and dance drama in local opera, "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" exudes a fresh and vigorous atmosphere. Its success is the victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought and the result of acting in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. First of all, we can clearly see that although this play uses many traditional gestures and techniques, its fresh atmosphere mainly comes from new ideas and new life. The comrades of the troupe studied Chairman Mao's works, went deep into the shipping life of the Sichuan River, and combined with the boatmen, laying a solid foundation for life. After they rehearsed the play, they first asked the boatmen for their opinions and tried to correct the shortcomings. Therefore, despite the use of an exaggerated song and dance drama form, it still gives the audience profound ideological education and a lively sense of life. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, on the basis of life, they carried out the correct process of discarding the old and bringing forth the new, destroying and establishing, while learning from new dance art and absorbing new artistic elements. Such efforts give us an inspiration: that is, when we create revolutionary modern dramas, we must correctly treat the relationship between thought, life, tradition, and new artistic elements.
    Secondly, it can also be clearly seen that although "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" has a relatively solid life basis, the comrades of the troupe are not satisfied with simply moving the natural form of life onto the stage, and they have carried out arduous labor in art. This is very valuable. It is higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal than ordinary actual life. The effort put into the stage art of "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" is not only reflected in the design and scheduling of many dance movements, nor is it only reflected in the rhythm control of the entire play, but the main key lies in the use of the artistic method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. In particular, the spirit of revolutionary romanticism is well embodied in this play. The director played a major role in this regard. The idealization of heroic images, the magnificence of singing and dancing, the high-spirited spirit of the times, and the embodiment of proletarian ideology have all reached a certain height in the entire performance. This is not easy. Such efforts give us another inspiration: to truly reflect life, we should, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, use the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, especially the spirit of revolutionary romanticism, to discover and express the heroic figures and heroic achievements full of revolutionary romanticism in life.
      "Daring Heart in Rapid Currents" still has some difficulties in literature to be solved, and can be further processed and improved in stage art. We hope that the comrades of the troupe will listen more widely to the opinions of the workers, peasants, soldiers and all parties, and continue to process and revise. We believe that the play will definitely be revised to be more complete and more exciting.

    惊涛骇浪看新人
    ——评川剧《急浪丹心》
    刘厚生
    川剧《急浪丹心》在舞台艺术上是有独创性成就的好戏；在戏剧文学上，《急浪丹心》有些缺点，但基本上也是好的，它在戏剧样式风格上做了若干试验，取得了一些经验，也很值得探讨。
    《急浪丹心》剧中，人用假名，事是真事。实际上写的真人真事。过去曾争论过真人真事能否写戏的问题。一般说来，用真人真事写戏局限性较大，不便于进行概括、典型化，比较麻烦。然而，从近年来戏剧创作实践看来，如果把这种说法绝对化，也是会成为一种框框的。
    《急浪丹心》写的是川江老船工驾长何忠民在船行险滩遇险时，为了全船船工、国家物资以及后面船队的安全，舍子救船的事。看来这是一场在舞台上十分难办的人同自然的斗争。但《急浪丹心》处理得很好。作者写了人同自然的搏斗，但更主要的是把人同自然的斗争作为背景，而在写人的不同思想的矛盾。戏中的人物都是正面人物，但在对待洪水、险滩的威胁上意见却不相同，归根到底还是正确与不正确，先进与落后的矛盾。这就构成了整个戏的矛盾冲突，构成了具有教育意义和能够感动人的戏。
    由于真人真事的局限，整个戏似乎缺少一贯到底的矛盾冲突。前半部的几个矛盾（以救不救红生的矛盾为主），都是发生了随即解决了；后半部则转为找不找得到红生的矛盾。因而整个戏在矛盾冲突的结构上，缺少反复纠葛、一步深一步的发展。这是一个弱点。尽管如此，这些似乎不相串连的矛盾冲突还是有其内在联系的：何忠民有退船让漕，帮助兄弟船只的思想，到了紧要关头，也就会有舍子救船的思想。情节的贯串性不强，但思想的贯串性很清楚；戏剧行动的有机发展不够，但人物性格却在这一个个矛盾冲突中显示出来了。在“战滩”一场的结尾，何忠民在红生落水后，众船工要救他时，压住自己的痛苦，高声滚白：“不许乱动！保船要紧，莫管娃娃。以艄代舵（这时舵已打坏），沉着冷静。架桨！”这些断金切玉般的语言，表现出他那豪迈的社会主义精神、慷慨的无产阶级襟怀！让我们感受到一个在惊涛骇浪中象高山似地屹立不动的战士性格的庄严，揭示了何忠民的最高的思想境界。这样，《急浪丹心》尽管情节比较简单，几个矛盾冲突相对地显得孤立，后半部缺少发展，然而通过这些具体行动，何忠民忠心耿耿、满怀热情、大公无私、一心为革命的刚强坚定的英雄形象，却刻划得相当突出。而他的性格，显然又典型地体现出那同船十几个人和广大的川江船工的共同的思想感情。
    《急浪丹心》的成就在舞台艺术方面是更为突出的。以导演为主，无论是表演、舞台美术和音乐，都很富于创造性。这种创造性又突出地表现为导演和演员等在生活的基础上，活用传统，同时吸收新的艺术因素，刻意追求具有民族风格的形式美。形式美决不是形式主义的“美”。形式主义的“美”是必须反对的，但为思想内容服务、为塑造英雄形象服务的形式美，则是越美越好。形式越美越能表现出内容的美，也才能更有吸引力和感染力，引导观众更深地理解思想内容。
    舞台背景是美的。设计者很有匠心，他在或殷红或天蓝的一色天幕上，用最简明的白线条画出云彩，太阳，松树，远山，近水，巨浪等等景物的轮廓。色调明朗，气势豪放。虽然悬崖陡壁、急水险滩的环境烘托得不够些，但嘉陵江大水时的辽阔浩淼表现得很有意境，点染出我们祖国的好看的关山胜景。这样的景，既有装饰意味又能同剧中人物感情相呼应；既指明地点又有回旋余地；既有民族画法的笔意又有生活实感。同整个戏的歌舞风格很谐和，很能为主题思想和表演服务。
    服装是美的。青年船工们一色的蓝色短袖小衣，黄腰带束得紧紧，敞胸露出红背心当中的一个大“奖”字，很有思想性，说明这是个先进集体。暗色草鞋上还点缀一个绒球。在岸上背纤时还戴上一顶淡黄大草帽。这都是生活中来，又都是提炼美化了的。给人以整齐、有力、谐和的美感。但是又不单调，因为在船工之后忽然出来一个穿白衬衣的红领巾，整个色彩更加活泼起来；最后出来的何忠民则在船工服装外加上一件较大短外衣，显出驾长的稳重。这是很成功的服装设计。
    唱腔曲调和演员音色也是美的。演何忠民的谢正新、演杜滩师的王起久、演周大刚的任庭芳，还有那伴唱队女声领唱王代全，都有一条好嗓子，音域宽，嗓音厚，配上雄壮的男声齐唱，很能显示川江船工的气魄。川江号子大量吸收进来，同川剧唱腔结合得很好。前三场中，全部是男声唱诵，但偏偏用上音色浑厚的女声伴唱；好几处地方，如第二场何忠民同杜滩师的对唱，在高腔打击音乐中加进了弦乐，这都使得戏在粗犷中抹上一些柔和的色彩，十分动听。
    最美的是舞蹈。《急浪丹心》把我国民族戏曲歌、舞、剧三者结合的传统中的舞蹈因素的作用大大提高了。它大大发展了戏曲中歌舞剧这种样式，并且为在舞台上表现人同自然斗争的题材创造了很好的经验。
    人同自然斗争的题材，在戏剧舞台上可以说是个困难问题。《急浪丹心》中何忠民和船工们在狂风巨浪中拉纤、掌舵、划桨、撑篙，在生活中就充满着大幅度的动作变化，完全可以成为舞蹈创作的素材。如果没有变化激烈的舞蹈动作，这样的戏是很难成立的。以人同自然的斗争作为戏曲题材，在矛盾冲突的结构发展上必须把握住人物之间的思想冲突，而在艺术表现手段方法上则需要充分发挥舞蹈的作用。这不仅是为了戏剧动作的美化，更重要的，是只有这样才能更有力、更细致地体现出人同自然斗争的复杂性、艰巨性，从而才能使看来比较单纯的矛盾冲突显示出其严重的深刻的意义，才能使英雄人物（个人或集体）的性格得到更绚烂的描绘。这个经验也许还不能适用于所有的人同自然斗争的题材，不能适用于一般的话剧，但最少对于象《急浪丹心》这类的戏曲是很重要的。
    我国传统戏曲中的舞蹈因素，一方面表现为日常生活中某些如上楼下楼、开门关门、穿针引线等动作的适度美化；一方面表现为某些强烈感情的抒发，如甩发、捋须、跪步等，而更大量的则表现为战斗舞。表现劳动的舞是极少的，歌颂劳动的舞更是没有的。《急浪丹心》第一场，一群船工背纤上场，使我们很自然地联想起旧中国的船工。他们一样背纤，但背的是剥削纤，走的是死亡路，“嘉陵江中水，船工血和泪”。但是现在，我们看到的，同样是背纤，却显示着无产阶级的力量，社会主义青年的力量。船工们同样是匍匐前进，甚至全身都伏到地上，而他们脸上都洋溢着为社会主义运输财富的喜悦，焕发着社会主义主人翁的光彩。他们的舞蹈动作，并不复杂，但棱角鲜明，节奏感很强，处处显示着劳动的欢快，显示着人在同自然斗争中发挥出来的无穷威力，显示着昂扬的时代精神。
    作为戏剧舞蹈，《急浪丹心》不仅歌颂了劳动，而且塑造了人物，并通过人物表达了思想。这是一群普通船工，但又是一群英雄船工，因此舞蹈必须表现出他们的英雄气概。第三场《战滩》最是酣畅地做到了这一点。当何忠民一声“同志们，准备进滩罗！”立刻，划桨动作越来越急，全体船工进入了紧张的气氛之中。然而，正当整个舞台上似乎需要依靠更多的人来造成更紧张的气氛时，舞台上却象电影中的推镜头似地向前推进，两行划桨船工逐渐隐没到舞台以外，只剩下何忠民一个人突出在台口。掌舵的驾长是全船的灵魂，尽管台上只有他一个人，但他的行动和思想，却集中显示了全体船工的共同要求。因此，我们觉得台上非常充实，他一人的力量重逾千钧。英雄的形象由于英雄的行动而得到树立，英雄的思想由于英雄的形象而得以体现。
    《急浪丹心》作为地方戏中的歌舞剧，散发着清新刚健的新鲜气息。它的成就，是毛泽东文艺思想的胜利，是按照毛主席的指示办事的结果。首先，我们很清楚地看到，尽管这个戏运用了不少传统的身段、手法，但它的新鲜气息主要是来自新的思想、新的生活。剧团同志们学习毛主席著作，深入川江航运生活，同船工们相结合，打下了坚实的生活基础。他们排出戏来，先请船工们提意见，把着手改正缺点。因此，尽管是运用了动作夸张的歌舞剧形式，但仍然给观众以深刻的思想教育和活泼的生活实感。在毛泽东思想指引下，在生活的基础上，他们对传统进行了正确的推陈出新，有破有立，同时向新舞蹈艺术借鉴，吸取新的艺术因素。这样的努力给我们一个启发：即我们在创造革命现代戏时，必须正确对待思想、生活同传统和新的艺术因素的关系。
    其次，还可以清楚地看到，《急浪丹心》尽管有着较坚实的生活基础，但剧团的同志们不满足于把生活的自然形态搬上舞台，他们在艺术上进行了艰巨的劳动。这是十分可贵的。它比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想。《急浪丹心》在舞台艺术上所下的功夫，不仅表现在许多舞蹈动作的设计和调度上，也不仅表现在整个戏的节奏掌握上，更主要的关键在于革命的现实主义同革命的浪漫主义相结合的艺术方法的运用。特别是革命浪漫主义精神，在这个戏中是有着很好的体现的。导演在这方面起了重大的作用。英雄形象的理想化，唱腔歌诵和舞蹈动作的壮美化，时代精神的昂扬，以及无产阶级思想气魄的体现，在整个演出中都达到了一定的高度。这是很不容易的。这样的努力给了我们又一个启发：要真正反映生活，就应当根据毛主席的指示，运用革命的现实主义同革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，特别是革命浪漫主义精神，去发掘、表现生活中的充满革命浪漫主义精神的英雄人物和英雄业绩。
      《急浪丹心》在文学上还有些困难尚待解决，在舞台艺术上也还可以进一步加工提高。我们希望，剧团的同志们更广泛地听取工农兵群众和各方面的意见，继续加工修改。我们相信，戏一定会改得更完整、更精彩。
