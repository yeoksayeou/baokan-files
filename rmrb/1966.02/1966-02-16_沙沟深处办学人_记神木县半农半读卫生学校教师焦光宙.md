    School Founder in the Depths of Shagou
    ——A Record of Jiao Guangzhou, Teacher at the Shenmu County Part-Work Part-Study Hygiene School
    Many people call Jiao Guangzhou of the Shenmu County Hygiene School in northern Shaanxi “Teacher Jiao,” and many others call him “Doctor Jiao.”
    At the school, he is responsible for specific administrative work, teaches, and even cooks his own meals.
    During the day, he teaches classes, treats villagers, participates in agricultural production labor, busy with this, busy with that. At night, when the students are fast asleep, his cave dwelling is still lit. He is preparing lessons, considering how to better cultivate health personnel for the people’s communes and production teams.
    For the Sake of the Peasants, For the Sake of the Revolution
    Jiao Guangzhou himself applied to come to this people-run hygiene school that combines labor and study.
    That was in July 1962, precisely when the school, after being suspended twice, was being re-established due to the decision of the county party committee and county people's committee, who accepted the opinions of the peasant masses. Jiao Guangzhou graduated from the Shaanxi Provincial Hygiene Cadre Refresher College on July 14th and returned to Shenmu County. The next day, he applied to the county culture, education, and health bureau to teach at this school.
    Why did he have such an aspiration?
    Jiao Guangzhou is the son of a peasant from the eight hundred li Qin River plains of Shaanxi Province. Before liberation, in 1945, when he was only fourteen years old, he was forced by life to wander to Xi'an City, where he worked as an apprentice in pharmacies and clinics for four consecutive years. At that time, he emptied bedpans, held children, cooked meals, and brewed tea, enduring curses and beatings. The boss never taught him any techniques, not even letting him learn how to give injections.
    After liberation, he quickly entered the Shaanxi Provincial Hygiene School, and his childhood dream of studying medicine was finally realized. He graduated in 1952. According to his wishes, he was assigned to the northernmost part of Shaanxi Province. He first worked at the Fugou County Hygiene Hospital, and later came to Shenmu County Hospital. The party and government leaders of the hospital attached great importance to going to the countryside to treat peasants, often sending doctors on long-distance consultations. Time and again, Jiao Guangzhou would bring simple medical equipment and medicine, traveling dozens or even hundreds of li to rescue various patients. Frequent trips to the countryside to treat peasants made Jiao Guangzhou deeply feel how much the countryside needed more doctors! Therefore, when he went to the countryside, he always took the time to train local health workers and midwives. He regarded training new health personnel as an important part of his work.
    November 10, 1956, was the most unforgettable day in Jiao Guangzhou's life. On this day, he gloriously joined the great Chinese Communist Party. From then on, he felt that his burden was even heavier, and he felt that his aspirations, his work, even treating a patient or training a health worker, were more closely linked to the revolution and the cause of communism.
    This time, when he asked to come to the hygiene school, he didn't think about anything else, only that he could contribute to the work of training medical and health personnel for this region. When the party approved his application, he moved into the school the same day. Someone worried about Jiao Guangzhou: "This school is a mess, it's not easy to run!" Jiao Guangzhou said: "I am doing it for the peasants, for the revolution."
    Let Students' Thoughts Enter the School
    With the support of the Party, the hygiene school reopened. There was only one teacher: Jiao Guangzhou. More than thirty students were formed into one class.
    After about twenty days of classes, he found that there was restlessness among the students. Some students didn't listen to the lectures in class and started doing other things. Some took "sick leave" and went home. Soon, two students left the school without saying goodbye. Once, in a physiology class, Liu Wanyi, who usually performed well in his studies, was suddenly intently writing large characters.
    After investigation, Jiao Guangzhou discovered that the students had an unclear understanding of the meaning of labor and doubted whether they could become doctors by both working and studying. He immediately reported to the county. He Shengxiao, the deputy director of the county culture, education, and health bureau, told him: "We must continue to run it! We must do our best to resolutely run it! We must conduct political and ideological education for the students."
    Liang Shitang, the then secretary of the Shenmu County Party Committee of the CPC, encouraged him and emphasized: "We must train rural medical personnel well."
    Jiao Guangzhou's confidence was boosted. He knew that he was not running this school alone, but that the party and the broad masses were running it. Therefore, it must be run well. Some students' erroneous views reflected that they did not have a correct understanding of what kind of doctors should be trained. Therefore, if ideology is not grasped first, it will be difficult to run the school well.
    He organized the students to study Chairman Mao's works such as "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" over and over again, and to study the party's educational policies.
    He and the students talked about the lack of doctors and medicine in the vast rural areas of Shenmu County left over from the old society. He also recalled to the students the sad and bitter days he had lived in the old society, saying: "At that time, I wanted to study medicine but couldn't. Today, you have such a good opportunity to study, can you still waste your youth?"
    The southern mountainous area of this county is an old revolutionary base. With the help of the county party committee and the county people's committee, the hygiene school invited veteran revolutionaries who had persisted in the revolutionary struggle to tell the students revolutionary stories.
    Jiao Guangzhou also used his spare time to have individual heart-to-heart talks with students, exchange views, and help them improve.
    The students discussed enthusiastically. Everyone talked about what kind of learning goals should be established and what kind of learning attitudes should be adopted. Student Liu Shengfu, after studying the two works "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," was greatly educated. He believed that in order to become a good doctor in the countryside, one must first have their thoughts enter the school, and have a heart that loves the countryside and cares for the peasants.
    From then on, most of the students settled down to study, and they were determined to complete their studies even better. Students such as Liu Shengfu and Liu Wanyi soon became study models.
    From then on, Jiao Guangzhou made grasping the students' active thoughts his regular work.
    Take the Masses as Teachers, Teach for the Masses
    After the hygiene school reopened, peasants came to the school to seek treatment one after another, and some people even asked the school to send doctors. During treatment, Jiao Guangzhou and the students discovered that many peasants liked to use acupuncture therapy. In order to meet the needs of the masses more quickly, Jiao Guangzhou, with the consent of the relevant leaders in the county, taught the principles and techniques of acupuncture treatment in advance. In a short period of time, the students mastered the acupuncture techniques. The patients praised in unison: "These students, who have only been in school for so long, can already give acupuncture." Jiao Guangzhou said: "This is what everyone taught, the masses are our teachers."
    Once, Jiao Guangzhou took his students to a clinic and discovered that Liu Enxiang, a poor peasant from Hejiapan Village, had suffered from chronic dysentery for twenty years and had been unable to participate in agricultural production labor for more than ten years. He thought: This is a very important case related to the digestive system, and students should have the opportunity to see it in order to learn the knowledge of treatment in this area well. However, at that time, they were teaching diseases of the circulatory system, which was not relevant to dysentery, so it was decided to teach the digestive system course in advance.
    A very interesting teaching session began. Jiao Guangzhou did not announce to the students what disease Liu Enxiang had, but only introduced that there was such a patient. After several classes on digestive system diseases, he proposed to bring Liu Enxiang to the school to "stay for treatment." The students warmly welcomed this. Some students immediately brought Liu Enxiang over. When Jiao Guangzhou saw Liu Enxiang, he asked in detail about the changes in his condition, and the students listened and took notes below. Then, everyone didn't look at Jiao Guangzhou's prescription, but each person judged according to their own understanding. More than thirty students put forward twelve different opinions. Jiao Guangzhou let everyone discuss and express their opinions, and continued to teach special courses such as chronic dysentery and chronic gastroenteritis. On this basis, he especially emphasized the characteristics of various common diseases of the digestive system, so that the students realized why Liu Enxiang's disease was chronic dysentery and not another disease.
    Under the care and treatment of the teachers and students of the school, Liu Enxiang gradually improved after more than twenty days. He thanked the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for running such a good school, and thanked "Old Jiao" and the students at the school. The students also felt that this method of learning was good, efficient, and memorable.
    In order to make the teaching content better adapt to the needs of the masses and further implement the instructions of the county party committee leaders on training rural medical personnel, Jiao Guangzhou, with the support of the relevant leadership departments in the county, took two students, braving the severe cold of about minus 20 degrees Celsius, to a remote place 70 li away from the county seat, located between the three communes of Yongxing, Shiyaodian, and Santang, to conduct a survey of common and frequently-occurring diseases. This place was surrounded by large and small gullies, with wind and snow, and the weather was freezing. They walked in this place for six days and visited more than twenty villages. Every time they arrived at a village, men, women, old and young people would enthusiastically surround them, some seeking medical treatment, some making requests, and some reporting situations. In six days, they learned about dozens of common diseases and treated more than seventy patients.
    In 1963, the school organized another larger survey and research activity. Sixteen students formed eight groups and went to various representative areas in the county, including desert areas, hilly areas, river areas, and mountainous areas, to treat some treatable diseases for patients while further understanding the situation of common and frequently-occurring diseases. This time, they traveled to more than 200 villages in ten communes.
    Seeing the hygiene school conducting surveys of common and frequently-occurring diseases, the county hospital and the county patriotic health movement committee provided Jiao Guangzhou and the students with a lot of relevant information. The materials they had mastered became even richer. They analyzed these materials and put forward the opinion that there were 130 major and common diseases in the county. With the consent of the relevant leaders in the county, these 130 diseases were listed as the focus of the course that must be explained in detail; among them, 60 diseases were particularly common and were listed as the focus of the focus.
    A Good Example of Serving the Peasants
    Many students who come out of the hygiene school always like to say: "We want to learn Teacher Jiao's medical skills, and we want to learn his medical attitude even more." "Whenever I encounter difficulties, I think of the teacher."
    Among them, many stories of Jiao Guangzhou's treatment of diseases are circulating.
    One spring morning, Jiao Guangzhou finished two classes and was preparing to rest. Suddenly, the door curtain rang and someone came in. He came from Yangcheng, more than 30 li away from here, named Yang Junxiu, and was a production team leader of the Santang People's Commune. In their team, a female commune member had a transverse dystocia and asked the hygiene school to send a doctor for emergency treatment.
    Outside, the wind rolled up sand and made a heavy whistling sound, and the sky was gray, and it was about to snow. Jiao Guangzhou glanced through the window, picked up his medical equipment, and said to Yang Junxiu, "Let's go!" A female student from Yangcheng was moved by the fact that the teacher was traveling such a long distance in such a big sandstorm, and followed behind.
    Five hours to walk more than 30 li of difficult mountain road. Still halfway, Jiao Guangzhou's old illness relapsed, but as soon as he arrived at the mother's home, he didn't have time to rest, so he looked at the patient first. At this time, another one of his students came in covered in sand. Jiao Guangzhou asked him: "What are you doing here in this weather?"
    The student smiled shyly and said: "You can come, so, I, came."
    By the evening, the parturient had passed the danger period. Jiao Guangzhou left one student to continue to take care of the patient, and he took another student and rushed back to school overnight in the wind and snow, and taught as usual the next day.
    Jiao Guangzhou never fails to arrive whenever he is called for treatment, whether it is day or night, wind, frost, rain, or snow, as long as he is invited, he leaves immediately. The school has established family sickbeds in the homes of some people with chronic diseases, and Jiao Guangzhou always brings students to see the patients on time, never delaying for no reason. The masses say that he is as accurate as a clock. Jiao Guangzhou, regardless of what disease the patient has, or how dangerous it is, will come to see it and be responsible to the end. If he can't cure it, he will try to recommend other doctors or suggest sending it to a certain place or hospital. He often said to his students: "Being able to relieve a patient's pain for one minute and prolong their life for one minute is the duty of a doctor."
    In the school, he took the lead in observing various rules and regulations; he led the students to repair houses and toilets; he and the students planted, managed, and harvested crops together at the agricultural production base.
    Jiao Guangzhou left an extremely deep impression on the students. Many students who returned to the countryside to engage in treatment, health care, and other work are also excellent. Some students put a health kit next to their pillows, and no matter if it is a dark night or a cold snowy day, as long as a commune member knocks on the door and asks for medical treatment, they turn over and get up, carry the health kit and leave. Some students, when participating in labor every day, also carry various "weapons" for seeing patients like Jiao Guangzhou. Some students, in order to take care of a critically ill patient, stay by the patient's side for several days without leaving. Some female students climb up steep mountains alone at night to treat patients and rush back overnight. The next day, looking at the towering mountains, they don't even know how they climbed over them.

    沙沟深处办学人
    ——记神木县半农半读卫生学校教师焦光宙
    陕北神木县卫生学校的焦光宙，许多人叫他焦老师，又有许多人叫他焦医生。
    在学校里，他负责具体的行政工作，又教书，又自己煮饭。
    白天，他上课，替社员治病，参加农业生产劳动，忙这，忙那。晚上，学生们睡熟了，他的窑洞却仍然亮着灯光。他在备课，在考虑着怎样更好地为人民公社、生产队培养卫生人材。
    为着农民　为着革命
    焦光宙是自己申请到这所一边劳动、一边读书的民办卫生学校来的。
    那是一九六二年七月，正是学校经过两次停办、县委和县人委接受农民群众意见决定复校的时候。焦光宙七月十四日从陕西省卫生干部进修学院毕业回到了神木县，第二天，他就向县文教卫生局申请到这个学校来教书。
    他为什么能有这样的志愿呢？
    焦光宙是陕西省八百里秦川上一个农民的儿子。解放前的一九四五年，他才十四岁，就为生活所逼流浪到西安市，在药房、诊疗所里连续作了四年学徒。那时，他倒尿盆，抱孩子，煮饭烧茶，受咒挨骂。老板从不教他技术，连打针也不让他学。
    解放后，他很快就进了陕西省卫生学校，小时的学医心愿终于实现了。一九五二年毕业。根据他的志愿，他被分配到陕西省的最北边。他先到府谷县卫生院工作，其后又来到神木县医院。院里党政领导对下乡为农民治病非常重视，常常派医生远道出诊。焦光宙一次又一次地带上简单的医疗器械和药品，走上几十里，一百多里，去抢救各种病人。经常下乡为农民治病，使焦光宙深深地感到农村里多么需要更多的医生啊！因此，他下农村，总是抽出时间来为当地培养卫生员和接生员。他把培养新的卫生人员作为自己的一项重要工作。
    一九五六年十一月十日，是焦光宙一生中最难忘的日子。这一天，他光荣地参加了伟大的中国共产党。从此，他感到自己的担子更重了，他觉得自己的志愿、工作，即使是治一个病人，培养一个卫生工作者，都和革命，和共产主义事业联系得更紧密了。
    这次他要求到卫生学校来，他没有想别的，只想能为这个地区培养医疗卫生人员的工作出自己一分力。当党批准他的申请后，他当天就搬进了学校。有人为焦光宙担心：“这个学校，烂摊子，不好办哩！”焦光宙说：“我是为着农民，为着革命。”
    让学生思想入校
    在党的支持下，卫生学校又开学了。老师就是一个：焦光宙。三十多个学生，编成一个班。
    已经上了二十来天的课。他发现在学生中出现了不安心学习的情况，有些学生在上课的时候不听讲解，做起旁的事情来了。有的“请病假”回家了。不久，有两个学生又不告而自动离了校。有一次上生理课，平时表现学习认真的刘万一，也忽然聚精会神地在写大字。
    焦光宙经过调查，原来是学生对劳动的意义认识不清，怀疑边劳动边读书能否学成医生。他马上向县里汇报。县文教卫生局副局长贺升效对他说：“要办下去！要尽自己的力量坚决办下去！要向学生进行政治思想教育。”
    当时的中共神木县委书记梁士堂鼓励他，并着重指出：“我们一定要好好培养农村医务人员。”
    焦光宙的信心足了。他知道不是一个人在办这所学校，是党在办，是广大群众在办，因此，一定能够办好。一些学生的错误看法，反映了他们对于应该培养什么样的医生的问题，没有正确的认识。因此，如果不首先抓好思想，就难于办好学校。
    他组织学生们一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等著作，学习党的教育方针。
    他和学生们一起，谈到旧社会遗留下来的神木县广大农村缺医少药的情况。他还向学生们回忆自己在旧社会过的那些悲苦的日子，他说：“那时，我想学医也学不成。今天，你们有这样好的学习机会，难道还能浪费自己的青春吗？”
    这个县的南部山区是革命老根据地。卫生学校在县委、县人委帮助下，邀请了当年坚持革命斗争的老前辈来向学生们讲革命故事。
    焦光宙还利用空闲时间，找学生个别谈心，交换看法，帮助提高。
    学生们热烈地讨论着。大家谈到应该树立什么样的学习目的，采取什么样的学习态度。学生刘生福，学习了《纪念白求恩》和《为人民服务》两篇著作后，受到了很大的教育。他认为要使自己成为一个农村的好医生，首先要思想入校，要有一颗热爱农村、关心农民的心。
    从此，学生们大都安下心来学习了，他们决心要把学习任务完成得更好。象刘生福、刘万一等同学，不久便当了学习模范。
    从此，焦光宙把抓学生的活思想作为自己经常性的工作。
    以群众为师　为群众而教
    卫生学校复课以后，农民纷纷到学校来治病，还有一些人要求学校派医生。焦光宙和学生在治疗当中，发现好些农民喜爱使用针灸疗法。焦光宙为了要更快地满足群众的要求，征得县里有关领导部门的同意，把针灸治疗的原理和技术提前讲授，学生在短短的时间内就掌握了针灸的技术。病人异口同声地称赞起来了：“这些学生，进校门才那么些日子，就会扎针了。”焦光宙说：“这是大家教的呀，群众就是我们的老师。”
    有一次，焦光宙带着学生出诊，发现贺家畔村的贫农刘恩祥，患慢性痢疾二十年了，不能参加农业生产劳动也有十多年。他想：这是有关消化系统一个很重要的病例，应该让学生有机会看看，以便学好这方面的治疗知识。可是，当时正在讲授循环系统的疾病课，和痢疾对不起头，就决定把消化系统的课提前来上。
    一次很有意思的教学开始了。焦光宙没有向学生宣布刘恩祥生的什么病，只介绍有这样一位病人。在上过几次消化系统疾病课之后，他提出要把刘恩祥接到学校来“住校治疗”。学生们热情欢迎这样做。有些学生就马上把刘恩祥接来了。焦光宙给刘恩祥看病时，详细地问了病情变化情况，学生们都在下面旁听，作记录。然后，大家都不看焦光宙的处方笺，各人根据自己的理解来判断。三十多个学生，提出了十二种不同的看法。焦光宙让大家讨论，各抒己见，并继续上了慢性痢疾、慢性肠胃炎等专题课，在这一基础上，特别着重说明消化系统各种常见病的特点，使学生们认识到刘恩祥的病，为什么是慢性痢疾，而不是别的病。
    刘恩祥在学校师生的照顾和治疗下，经过二十多天，渐渐好起来了。他感谢共产党、毛主席办起了这样好的学校，感谢学校里的“老焦”和学生。学生们也感到这种学习办法好，效率高，记得牢。
    为了使教学内容更好地适应群众的要求，进一步贯彻县委负责同志提出的培养农村医务人员的指示，焦光宙在县有关领导部门支持下，带着两个学生，冒着摄氏零下二十度左右的严寒，到了离县城七十来里的介于永兴、石窑店、三堂等三个公社之间的一块偏僻地方，作了一次常见病、多发病的调查。这个地方四周都是大大小小的山沟，风雪交加，天寒地冻。他们就在这块地方走了六天，访问了二十多个村子。每到一个村子，男女老少都热情地围上来，有求医的，有提要求的，有反映情况的。六天，他们了解了几十种常见病，并为七十多个病人进行了治疗。
    一九六三年，这个学校又组织了一次较大的调查研究活动。十六个学生组成八个小组，分赴县内各种有代表性的地区，包括沙漠地区、丘陵地区、河川地区和山区，一边为病人治疗一些能治的病，一边进一步了解常见病、多发病的情况。这次，他们走了十个公社的二百多个村子。
    看到卫生学校作常见病、多发病的调查，县医院、县爱国卫生运动委员会向焦光宙和学生们提供了许多有关的资料。他们掌握的材料就更丰富了。他们把这些材料作了分析，提出了全县有一百三十种主要的、常见的疾病的意见。经县有关领导部门的同意，这一百三十种病，就被列为课程中必须精讲和细讲的重点；其中有六十种病是特别常见的，就被列为重点中的重点。
    为农民服务的好榜样
    许多由卫生学校出来的学生总喜欢这样说：“我们要学习焦老师的治病技术，更要学习他的治病态度。”“一碰到困难，就想起老师。”
    在他们之中，流传着许多焦光宙治病的故事。
    一个春天的早上，焦光宙上完两节课，准备休息。忽然，门帘响了，进来了一个人。他来自离这里三十多里的杨城，叫杨俊秀，是三堂人民公社的一个生产队长。在他们队里，有个女社员发生横位难产，要求卫生学校派医生去急救。
    外面，大风卷起沙子发出沉重的呼啸声，天灰蒙蒙的，马上要下雪了。焦光宙透过窗户看了一眼，就拿起医疗器械，对杨俊秀说：“走！”一个家住杨城的女学生为老师冒着这样大的风沙长途出诊的事所感动，也跟在后面出发了。
    五个小时走完了三十多里难走的山路。还在半路，焦光宙的旧病就复发了，但一到产妇家，他顾不得休息，就先看病人。这时候，他的又一个学生披着满身沙土进来了。焦光宙问他：“这种天气，你来做啥？”
    学生憨笑着说：“你能来，我，就来了。”
    到傍晚，产妇已度过了危险期。焦光宙留下一个学生继续看护病人，自己带着另一个学生，连夜冒着风雪赶回学校，第二天照常上课。
    焦光宙治病从来是随叫随到，不管是白天黑夜，风霜雨雪，只要有请，他拔腿就走。学校在一些患慢性病的人的家里建立了家庭病床，焦光宙总是按时带着学生来看病，从不无故延迟，群众说他准确得象时钟一样。焦光宙治病，不论病人生的什么病，危险到什么程度，他都要来看看，负责到底。他治不了的，就想方设法推荐其他医生，或建议送到什么地方什么医院去。他经常对学生说：“能为病人解除一分痛苦，延长一分钟生命，都是一个医生应有的职责。”
    在学校里，他带头遵守各项制度；他率领着学生修房子，修厕所；他和同学们一起在农业生产基地上播种，田间管理，收割。
    焦光宙给学生留下了极其深刻的印象。许多学生回到农村，担任治病、保健等工作，也是好样的。有些学生枕头旁边放着保健箱，不论在伸手不见五指的黑夜，或者在风雪的寒天，只要有社员叫门请医，他们便翻身爬起来，背起保健箱就走。有些学生每天参加劳动的时候，也跟焦光宙一样带着看病的各种“武器”。有些学生，为了看护一个危重病人，一连几天守在病人旁边，不肯离开。有的女学生，晚上一个人爬上陡峭的高山，去为病人治病，并连夜赶回。第二天，望望那耸峙的山岭，自己也不知道是怎样爬过去的。
