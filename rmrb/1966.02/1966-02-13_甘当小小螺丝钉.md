    In 1963, when I visited home, the villagers were engaged in dredging rivers and controlling floods with great enthusiasm. At the construction site, I saw a thin, simple cadre whom people affectionately called Old Jiao. I didn't recognize him and asked others, "Is Old Jiao a newly arrived commune cadre?" Everyone shook their heads and smiled. Later, I learned that he was our county Party secretary, Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    Today, as I read the reports of Comrade Jiao Yulu's heroic deeds and recall his voice and appearance, I feel an indescribable emotion. It was he, our good secretary of Lankao, who led us to take the road of self-reliance, overthrow the "three scourges," achieve a bumper harvest, and change the backwardness of our hometown!
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was so unafraid of hardship, fatigue, and difficulty, wholeheartedly serving the people; but I, on the other hand, have quite a few selfish and impure thoughts. I am a cook. In the past, I looked down on this job, thinking it was unpromising and not loving my work, let alone delving into it. After studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, I received a great education. In the future, I must take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and put great effort into the word "application," using Mao Zedong Thought to guide my actions in every moment and in every matter, being utterly devoted to others without any thought of self, loving whatever line of work I am in, actively studying technology, doing a good job in cooking, and truly playing the role of a revolutionary screw.

    甘当小小螺丝钉
    黄华科
    一九六三年我探家时，乡亲们正在热火朝天地挖河治涝。在工地上，我见到一个瘦瘦的、朴朴素素的干部，人们都亲切地叫他老焦。我不认识他，就问别人：“老焦是新来的社干部么？”别人都笑着摇摇头。过后我才知道他就是我们的县委书记焦裕禄同志。
    今天当我读着关于焦裕禄同志的英雄事迹的报道，回想到他的音容笑貌，心里说不出的感动。就是他，我们兰考人民的好书记，带领着我们走自力更生的道路，斗倒了“三害”，夺得了丰收，改变了家乡的落后面貌啊！
    焦裕禄同志是那样不怕苦，不怕累，不怕困难，一心一意为人民服务；可是我呢，却有不少私心杂念。我是一个炊事员。过去，我是看不起这个工作的，认为干这没出息，不热爱本职工作，当然更谈不上钻研了。学习了焦裕禄同志的事迹后，我受到了很大的教育。今后，我一定要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，时时、事事用毛泽东思想指导行动，毫不利己、专门利人，干一行，爱一行，积极钻研技术，做好炊事工作，真正起到一颗革命螺丝钉的作用。
