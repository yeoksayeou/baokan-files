    Indestructible Copper Walls and Iron Bastions
    ——A Record of the Anti-"Sweep" Struggle by the Military and Civilians of Cu Chi District, Gia Dinh Province
    An Unyielding People
    A large liberated area in Cu Chi District, Gia Dinh Province, extends directly to the vicinity of Saigon, closely linked with Saigon. It is like a sharp knife thrust into the heart of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.
    The enemy regards the liberated area of Cu Chi District as a thorn in their side, a dagger in their heart, and they must remove it. In recent years, they have continuously launched offensives, attempting to reoccupy this area in order to establish a line of defense to protect their most important nest—Saigon. Last year, the enemy used unprecedentedly cruel means to carry out "sweeps," shelling, bombing, and spreading chemical poisons in this area. The sky over Cu Chi District resounded day and night with the piercing wails of enemy aircraft. In the northern part of Cu Chi District, from Phu My Hung commune to An Phu, Dong An Nhan, Tay An Nhan, Nhuan Duc, and Duc Hiep communes, there is no land, no tree, and no blade of grass that does not bear the scars of enemy shells, bombs, or chemical poisons.
    However, the heroic people of Cu Chi are invincible. They are not afraid of powerful enemies, they persist in fighting, and they become stronger as they fight. Whenever the enemy bombs or shells, the elderly and children quickly hide in the sturdy bunkers in their houses, outside their gardens, in the fields, or by the roadside. The male and female members of the guerrillas and self-defense forces immediately enter the fortifications, closely monitor the activities of enemy aircraft, and severely punish these "iron crows" whenever they have the opportunity. When the enemy spreads chemical poisons, people put on the gas masks they carry with them. When the enemy attacks from the ground, the guerrillas and self-defense forces enter the fortifications, stand in strict formation, and prepare to strike hard at the enemy; the elderly stay at home and engage in face-to-face struggle with the enemy; and others move to safe places. In Cu Chi, every commune and every village has a crisscrossing network of communication trenches and combat fortifications, as well as traps, minefields, and hand grenades everywhere. Relying on these, the military and civilians of Cu Chi District have smashed enemy "sweeps" time and again, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. In May last year, the military and civilians of Cu Chi District completely annihilated two enemy main-force battalions in Nhuan Duc commune; in December, they completely annihilated an enemy battalion in Cai Chong, and shot down many enemy planes.
    Glorious Victory
    From January 8 to 19 this year, eight thousand U.S. aggressor troops and puppet troops launched a large-scale "sweep" against the northern liberated area of Cu Chi District. They also deployed two armored vehicle regiments, six hundred military vehicles, and more than two hundred aircraft of various types in coordination with the operation. With the iron will to resolutely defend the liberated area, the heroic military and civilians of Cu Chi District made full preparations in advance and gave the enemy a heavy head-on blow.
    When the enemy's infantry began to attack, the military and civilians of Cu Chi District coordinated closely in combat. The guerrillas tracked the enemy every step of the way, launching continuous attacks, while the Liberation Army fiercely attacked the enemy's marching camps, throwing them into confusion. At the same time, thousands of people also engaged in face-to-face struggles with the U.S. aggressors, reclaiming arrested people and looted property, and restricting the enemy's destruction.
    The guerrillas fought particularly well in this large-scale anti-"sweep" battle. They used rudimentary weapons to eliminate a large number of the enemy's effectives. Many units and individuals annihilated ten to twenty-five U.S. aggressor troops, winning the glorious titles of "Heroic Annihilators of Americans" and "American-Annihilating Warriors." One guerrilla member in An Phu commune fought alone, and after killing an American soldier, he hid in a nearby fortification. When the enemy's companions came to collect the body, he killed two more. On January 8, the day the battle began, the Miao Zhuang guerrillas achieved outstanding results: annihilating fifty-seven enemy troops. From morning to afternoon on this day, the Gu Zhuang guerrillas fought five battles, annihilating more than forty enemy troops. At the landing site of American helicopters in An Phu commune, the guerrillas on both sides of the road and in nearby villages opened fire fiercely, shooting down seven American planes. On the same day, the enemy troops "sweeping" towards E Nei also suffered a fierce barrage from the guerrillas and a large number of them were annihilated. That night, many guerrilla groups sneaked into the enemy's Zhong He stronghold and other enemy camps, launching surprise attacks and sending the enemy scurrying for their lives in a panic. In the chaos, hundreds of enemy troops lost their lives.
    Having suffered, the U.S. aggressor troops no longer dared to be as arrogant as they were when they first arrived. They became "cautious," but still could not escape the guerrillas' punishment.
    On the afternoon of January 10, a guerrilla squad in Zhong Li village, Phu My Hung commune, with an incomparably courageous fighting spirit, disregarding the enemy's bombs and artillery fire, used landmines to damage three M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, completely annihilated the American troops on board, and repelled the enemy's attack.
    According to statistics, in the twelve consecutive days of anti-"sweep" battles from January 8 to 19, the military and civilians of Cu Chi District fought more than two hundred large and small battles, annihilating one thousand three hundred and eighteen U.S. aggressor troops and puppet troops, of which one thousand and seventy-six American bandits were killed, destroying forty-eight enemy military vehicles of various types, two 105 mm artillery pieces, and eight 81 mm mortars, shooting down twenty-nine enemy planes (mostly helicopters), and damaging fifty. In addition, the guerrillas captured many American bandits alive and seized large quantities of weapons and military supplies.
    Heroic Example
    This new glorious victory of the heroic military and civilians of Cu Chi not only shattered the enemy's plot to break the increasingly tightening iron encirclement of the Saigon area by the military and civilians of South Vietnam, but also annihilated an important part of the U.S. aggressor troops' effectives. The great victory in Cu Chi District shows that no matter where (even if it is close to the enemy's nest), no matter how many troops the enemy has, what kind of troops they deploy, or how many modern weapons they possess, and no matter how ferocious and barbaric they are, the heroic military and civilians of South Vietnam will surely be able to defeat them.

### 坚不可摧的铜墙铁壁——嘉定省古芝县军民反“扫荡”纪实

    坚不可摧的铜墙铁壁
    ——嘉定省古芝县军民反“扫荡”纪实
    不屈的人民
    嘉定省古芝县的一大片解放区直伸到西贡附近，同西贡紧紧相连，它象一把尖刀，直插进美帝国主义及其走狗的心脏。
    敌人把古芝县解放区看作眼中钉，肉中刺，非拔掉不可。近几年来，他们不断发动进攻，妄图重新占领这个地区，以便建立一道防线，保卫他们最重要的巢穴——西贡。去年，敌人更是用前所未有的残酷手段，向这个地区进行“扫荡”、炮击、轰炸和撒放化学毒药。古芝县的上空日夜震响着敌机发出的刺耳的啸音。在古芝县北部，从富美兴乡到安富、东安仁、西安仁、润德和德协等乡，没有一块土地、一棵树木和一根草，不带有敌人的炮弹、炸弹或化学毒药造成的伤痕。
    但是，英雄的古芝人民是不可战胜的，他们不怕强敌，坚持战斗，越战越强。每当敌人轰炸或炮击的时候，老人和小孩迅速躲到屋里、园外、田间或路边的坚固的地洞里，游击队和自卫队的男女队员马上进入工事，严密监视敌机的活动，一有机会，就严厉惩罚这些“铁乌鸦”。敌人撒放化学毒药的时候，人们就戴上随身带着的防毒器具。敌人从地面上进攻的时候，游击队和自卫队进入工事，严阵以待，准备痛击敌人；老年人留在家里跟敌人进行面对面的斗争；其他的人就转移到安全的地方去。在古芝，每个乡、每个村都有纵横交错的交通壕和战斗工事，都有遍布各处的陷阱、地雷阵和手榴弹。古芝县军民依靠这些东西，粉碎了敌人一次又一次的“扫荡”，给敌人以严重的打击。去年五月间，古芝县军民在润德乡全歼了敌人两个主力营；十二月，又在盖宗全歼敌军一个营，并且打落敌人许多架飞机。
    光辉的胜利
    今年一月八日到十九日，美国侵略军和仆从军八千人向古芝县北部解放区发动了一次大规模“扫荡”，他们还出动了两个装甲车团、六百辆军用车和二百多架各种类型的飞机配合作战。英雄的古芝县军民怀着坚决保卫解放区的钢铁意志，事前作好了充分准备，给敌人以沉重的迎头痛击。
    在敌人的步兵开始进攻的时候，古芝县军民就非常紧密地配合战斗。游击队寸步不离地追踪敌军，连续进行袭击，解放军则猛捣敌人的行军营地，把他们打得晕头转向。与此同时，数以千计的群众也同美国侵略者展开了面对面的斗争，夺回被逮捕的人和被抢走的财产，限制敌人的破坏。
    游击队在这次大规模的反“扫荡”战斗中，打得特别出色。他们用简陋的武器消灭了敌人大量的有生力量。许多单位和个人都歼灭美国侵略军十到二十五名，获得了“英勇歼美”和“歼美勇士”的光荣称号。安富乡一位游击队员孤胆作战，在打死了一个美国兵之后，又隐蔽在附近的工事里，等敌人的同伙来收尸时，又打死了两个。庙庄游击队在一月八日战斗开始那一天，就获得了卓越的战绩：歼灭敌人五十七名。谷庄游击队从这天早晨到下午，进行了五次战斗，歼敌四十多名。在安富乡美国直升飞机着陆的地方，公路两旁和附近各个村庄的游击队都一齐猛烈开火，打落美国飞机七架。在同一天中，向鹅内“扫荡”的敌军也遭到游击队的猛烈阻击，被歼灭了一大批。当天夜晚，许多游击小组又神出鬼没地潜入敌人的中和据点和其它敌军营地，进行奇袭，打得敌人屁滚尿流，鼠窜逃命。在一片混乱中，数以百计的敌人丧命。
    美国侵略军吃了苦头，再也不敢象初来时那么嚣张了。他们变得“谨慎”了，但仍然逃不脱游击队的惩罚。
    一月十日下午，富美兴乡中利村一个游击小组以无比英勇的战斗精神，不顾敌人的炸弹和炮火，用地雷炸坏三辆Ｍ—113型两栖装甲车，全歼车上的美军，击退了敌人的进攻。
    据统计，在一月八日到十九日为止的连续十二天的反“扫荡”战斗中，古芝县军民共进行了二百多场大小战斗，歼灭一千三百十八名美国侵略军和仆从军，其中有一千零七十六名美国强盗被打死，摧毁敌人各种军用车四十八辆、一零五毫米大炮两门、八十一毫米迫击炮八门，打落敌机二十九架（大部分是直升飞机），打伤五十架。此外，游击队还活捉了许多美国强盗，缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    英雄的榜样
    英雄的古芝军民这一新的辉煌胜利，不但粉碎了敌人妄图打破越南南方军民对西贡地区的日益紧缩的钢铁包围圈的阴谋，而且歼灭了美国侵略军一部分重要的有生力量。古芝县的这次大捷表明：无论是在哪一个地方（即使是紧靠着敌人的巢穴），不管敌人有多少兵力，出动什么样的军队，拥有多少现代化武器，也不管他们凶恶、野蛮到什么程度，英勇的越南南方军民一定能够打败他们。　（据越南南方解放电台）
