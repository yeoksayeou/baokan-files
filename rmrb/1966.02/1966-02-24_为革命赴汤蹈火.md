　　To Go Through Fire and Water for the Revolution
　　Li Wenrui, Political Commissar of the Unit Where Ouyang Hai Served

　　The novel "Ouyang Hai's Song," with its intense revolutionary passion, extols the short but glorious life of Ouyang Hai; with profound strokes, it portrays the spiritual face of a new generation of communists. From Ouyang Hai's growth, we see the strides our army is taking towards extreme proletarianization and extreme combat readiness, and we also see the height to which a revolutionary fighter's spiritual power will reach once armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

    Ouyang Hai, in his short combat life, created many admirable heroic deeds, but what we remember most is his great spirit of dedicating his red heart to the people and placing the people's interests above all else. The reason he was able to disregard his own safety at a critical moment, bravely pulling away the warhorse and using his own life to save the people's lives and property, is the inevitable manifestation of this spirit of devoting himself to the people.

    Comrade Ouyang Hai once rushed into a fire to save an old woman, and disregarded the cold to jump into the water three times to save a drowning child. He never hesitated when doing these things, regardless of his personal safety; moreover, he regarded all this as what a People's Liberation Army soldier should do, as insignificant. He was not only able to step forward in these critical moments of life and death, but also in ordinary matters, as long as it related to the interests of the people, he always did his best to do it meticulously. I remember once when the troops held a field exercise, two new soldiers inserted "camouflage circles" with tea tree branches. After he discovered this, he specifically convened a class meeting to educate everyone to not commit the slightest offense against the masses and to care for the interests of the masses everywhere. Another time, the troops went to help the masses with labor, and a hoe was missing when it was time to stop work. Comrade Ouyang Hai discovered this, but he didn't have any money with him, so he took off his PLA shoes and gave them to the owner, as compensation. He walked more than twenty miles barefoot back to the barracks.

    Ouyang Hai's spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly is also manifested in his noble style of loving the people and helping others. Once, when the troops were carrying out a mission, they stayed in the home of a poor peasant. The landlord couple went out early and returned late every day, leaving four unattended children at home, the younger ones crying and the older ones making noise. Comrade Ouyang Hai automatically took on the household chores of this family. He not only washed the children's faces, washed their clothes, made toys, and told them stories, but also cleaned the inside and outside of the house and filled the water tank and cooked dinner. He was patient, thoughtful, and organized, which moved the landlord couple very much. Another time, the troops were stationed near a primary school. Ouyang Hai saw that the teachers were too busy, so he automatically helped the teachers grade homework. With Ouyang Hai's limited education, it was difficult for him to do this. But he saw this as a politically significant task and devoted himself wholeheartedly to it. He leaned over a dim kerosene lamp, meticulously correcting the children's mistakes stroke by stroke, and wrote a sentence on each homework book: "Be a good child of Chairman Mao, and make progress every day!" How deep was Comrade Ouyang Hai's respect for Chairman Mao, and how sincere was his love for the children! Another time, the troops were carrying out a mission in a certain place. An old man who collected firewood had to pass by the troops' residence every evening carrying a load of firewood. After Ouyang Hai found out, he waited at the intersection every day at the appointed time to take the old man's firewood load and help him send it home. He never stopped unless the old man didn't come. Once, because the troops went out and missed the time, Ouyang Hai didn't have time to eat dinner and delivered firewood to the old man on an empty stomach. The old man was so moved that he told everyone he met. To this day, the story of "the army delivering firewood" is still circulating in that area.

    Ouyang Hai's deep and unparalleled love for the people, for his comrades, and for the motherland stemmed, on the one hand, from the class consciousness of this bitter child who had begged for food; on the other hand, and more importantly, from the ideological nourishment he drew from studying Chairman Mao's works. He studied Chairman Mao's works with eagerness, almost to the point of forgetting sleep and food, reading with a book in his hand whenever he had time. Sometimes he hid under the street lights at night to read, forgetting the lights-out signal, and studied until late at night; if he didn't understand a problem, he would toss and turn in bed, and if he couldn't figure it out, he would read with a flashlight until he understood. His comrades called him a "learning fanatic." This is also truthfully described in the novel. Before joining the army, Comrade Ouyang Hai had only intermittently attended night school for a year and a half. He didn't recognize many words in Chairman Mao's books; some he recognized but didn't understand the meaning. However, this did not stump Ouyang Hai. He bought a dictionary, looked up new words when he encountered them, learned culture and read articles at the same time, reading word by word and thinking sentence by sentence, and finally read through Volumes One to Four of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." What a great perseverance! It was Mao Zedong Thought that nurtured him, raised his class consciousness, and "brightened his eyes"; and it was from Chairman Mao's works and from Chairman Mao himself that he learned and inherited the great spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, everything for the people, and completely and thoroughly for the people.

    Ouyang Hai's heroic act of rescuing the train was by no means an accidental or momentary impulse. It was precisely because in his daily life he could always, in everything, and everywhere think of the people, enthusiastically, consciously, and wholeheartedly serve the people, showing the most tenacious and lasting revolutionary heroism, that at a critical juncture, when the people needed him to step forward, he could unhesitatingly dedicate his life. People who are always thinking about personal interests and haggling over personal gains in daily life can only dream of making great heroic deeds at a critical moment!

    Reading "Ouyang Hai's Song," let us advance along the road Comrade Ouyang Hai has traveled, learn from Comrade Ouyang Hai, go through fire and water for the people and for the revolution, never hesitate to die, and carry the revolution through to the end!

### 为革命赴汤蹈火

　　为革命赴汤蹈火
　　欧阳海生前所在部队政委　李文瑞
    小说《欧阳海之歌》以强烈的革命激情，歌颂了欧阳海短暂而光辉的一生；以深刻的笔触，刻划了共产主义一代新人的精神面貌。从欧阳海的成长过程里，我们看到了我军向着非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化前进的步伐，也看到了一个革命战士一旦为毛泽东思想所武装，他的精神力量将会发挥到怎样的高度！
    欧阳海在他生前短暂的战斗生活里，创造了许多可歌可泣的英雄业绩，而最使我们难忘的是他掏尽红心为人民，把人民利益置于一切之上的伟大精神。他所以能在千钧一发的关头，奋不顾身地拉开战马，用自己的生命抢救人民的生命财产，正是他这种为人民鞠躬尽瘁的精神的必然表现。
    欧阳海同志生前曾经冲进烈火救过一个老大娘，不顾寒冷三次跳进水里救过溺水的小孩。他做这些事情的时候，从来都是毫不犹豫，不顾个人安危的；而且他把这一切都看成是一个解放军战士应该做的，是微不足道的。他不仅能在这些生死攸关的严重时刻挺身而出，就是在平常的事情上，只要关系到人民的利益，他总是竭尽全力去做，一丝不苟。记得有一次部队举行野外演习，两个新战士用茶树枝插“伪装圈”。他发现后，专门召开了一次班务会，教育大家对群众的东西要秋毫无犯，处处关心群众利益。还有一次部队去帮助群众劳动，临收工时少了一把锄头。欧阳海同志发现了，但是他身上没带钱，于是他就从自己脚上脱下那双解放鞋，给了失主，作为赔偿，他赤着两只脚走了二十多里路，回到营房。
    欧阳海全心全意为人民服务的精神，还表现在他热爱人民、助人为乐的高尚风格上。有一次部队执行任务，他们住在一个贫农家里。房东夫妇每天早出晚归，家里留下四个无人照顾的孩子，小的哭，大的闹。欧阳海同志自动抽空担起这个家庭的家务。他不仅给孩子们洗脸、洗衣、做玩具、讲故事，而且还把里里外外打扫得干干净净，把水缸装满，把晚饭做好。他耐心周到，井井有条，把房东夫妇感动得不得了。还有一次，部队住在一个小学校附近。欧阳海看到教师忙不过来，自动帮助老师批改作业。凭欧阳海的那点文化，他是很难胜任的。但是他把这看成是一项有政治意义的工作，专心致志地干这件事。他伏在一盏昏暗的小油灯底下，一笔一划、工工整整地给孩子们批改错误，而且在每个作业本子上写上一句话：“做毛主席的好孩子，天天向上！”欧阳海同志对毛主席的敬爱，多么深厚，对孩子的爱，多么至诚！还有一次，部队在某地执行任务。有一个打柴的老大爷每天傍晚都要挑一担柴从部队住地经过。欧阳海发现后，每天一到时间就到路口等着接老人的柴担，帮他送回家。除非老人不来，从无间断。有一回因为部队外出误了时间，欧阳海来不及吃晚饭，空着肚子给老人送柴。老人家被感动得逢人便讲。至今，在那一带还流传着“大军送柴”的故事。
    欧阳海同志对人民，对同志，对祖国这种深厚无比的热爱，一方面是出于他这个讨过饭的苦孩子的阶级自觉；另方面，更重要的是他从学习毛主席著作中汲取了思想滋养。他学习毛主席著作如饥似渴，简直到了忘寝废食的地步，一有空就手不释卷地读。有时夜间他躲到路灯下读书，竟忘记了熄灯号，一直学到深夜；一个问题没弄通，躺在床上还翻来复去地想，想不通又打着手电读，直到弄懂为止。同志们都叫他“学习迷”。这一点，在小说里也作了如实的描写。欧阳海同志入伍前，只断断续续地进过一年半夜校，毛主席的书上有好多字他不认得；有的认得又不明白意思。但是，这并没有难倒欧阳海。他买了一本字典，碰上生字就查，边学文化边读文章，就这样一个字一个字地读，一句一句地想，终于通读了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷。多大的毅力啊！正是毛泽东思想哺育了他，提高了他的阶级觉悟，“拨亮了他的眼睛”；也正是从毛主席的著作里，从毛主席的身上，他学习了、继承了一心为人民，一切为人民，完全地、彻底地为人民服务的伟大精神。
    欧阳海抢救列车的英雄行为，决不是偶然的、一时的冲动。正因为在日常生活里，他能时时、事事、处处为人民着想，热忱地、自觉地、全心全意地为人民服务，表现了最顽强、最持久的革命英雄主义，因而在严峻的关头，当人民需要他挺身而出的时候，他能毫不犹豫地献出自己的生命。在日常生活中念念不忘个人利益、斤斤计较个人得失的人，要想在严重的关头做出轰轰烈烈的英雄行为，那只能是妄想！
    读《欧阳海之歌》，让我们踏着欧阳海同志所走过的道路前进，向欧阳海同志学习，为人民、为革命赴汤蹈火，万死不辞，将革命进行到底！
