    (Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch) The comprehensive rural reader 《Dongfang Hong》 1966 edition has recently been published by the Rural Reading Material Publishing House.
    This edition of 《Dongfang Hong》 includes images of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, and selections of his poems; typical deeds of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; introductions to Dazhai-style communes and teams across the country; political common sense such as class struggle and ideological education, and militia knowledge; as well as the 1966 People's Almanac and practical knowledge of agriculture, science, hygiene, and culture; and guidance materials for various activities of rural clubs, revolutionary songs, etc. The book contains more than two hundred articles and nearly six hundred pictures, including various forms such as prose, rhyme, stories, and comic strips. The content is rich, easy to understand, and suitable for rural educated youth, commune and team cadres, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.
    The comprehensive reader 《Dongfang Hong》, specially edited for rural readers, is published annually. Two previous issues have been published, and this issue has been significantly improved in terms of content and arrangement.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 2nd dispatch) The Shanghai Science and Technology Publishing House recently published the popular science reading material for rural areas in the form of comic strips - "Rural Science and Technology Comic Strips". Currently, three types have been published, including 《Plastic Film Rice Seedling Cultivation》, 《Eliminating Schistosomiasis》, and 《Eliminating Oncomelania》.
    The characteristics of 《Rural Science and Technology Comic Strips》 are: many pictures and few words, easy to understand, the specific methods introduced are easy for rural readers to comprehend, and can be used as a reference. In addition to introducing some scientific and technological issues, the comic strips also pay attention to solving some ideological problems. For example, in 《Plastic Film Rice Seedling Cultivation》, in addition to introducing the experiences of land preparation, tool preparation, sowing, shed construction, seedling management, and storage and preservation of plastic film, it also makes specific calculations of the cost of the film to resolve the "uneconomical" ideological concerns of the peasants. In addition to introducing protective knowledge such as treating patients, eliminating Oncomelania, and managing feces, 《Eliminating Schistosomiasis》 and 《Eliminating Oncomelania》 also introduce the process of improving people's ideological understanding of schistosomiasis.
    Not long after the National Science and Education Film Work Conference last year, the Shanghai Science and Technology Publishing House began to conceive and organize the editing and publication of 《Rural Science and Technology Comic Strips》, which is mainly aimed at the vast rural readers. They adopted a method that combines leaders, editors, painters, and authors, emphasizing highlighting politics and quality first. The authors of the comic strips are all grassroots scientific and technological personnel working in rural areas. These 《Rural Science and Technology Comic Strips》 publications have repeatedly solicited the opinions of relevant departments and rural cadres and masses, and have been revised many times before being finalized.

    综合性农村读物
   《东方红》一九六六年本出版
    上海出版《农村科技连环画》
    新华社一日讯　综合性农村读物《东方红》一九六六年本，最近已由农村读物出版社出版。
    这一期的《东方红》中有毛主席象、毛主席语录和诗词选刊，活学活用毛主席著作的典型事迹；全国各地大寨式的社、队介绍，阶级斗争、思想教育等政治常识和民兵知识；还有一九六六年人民历和农业、科学、卫生、文化等实用知识，以及农村俱乐部各项活动的辅导材料、革命歌曲等。全书共二百多篇文章，近六百幅图片，包括散文、韵文、故事、连环画等各种体裁，内容丰富，通俗易懂，适合农村知识青年、社队干部和广大贫农下中农社员阅读。
    专为农村读者编辑的综合读物《东方红》每年出一期，过去已经出过两期，这一期在内容和编排上作了较大的改进。
    新华社二日讯　上海科学技术出版社最近出版了连环画形式的农村科技通俗读物——《农村科技连环画》。目前已出版的有《塑料薄膜育稻秧》、《消灭血吸虫病》、《消灭钉螺》等三种。
    《农村科技连环画》的特点是：图多字少，通俗易懂，介绍的具体方法农村读者容易领会，并可参考应用。连环画除了介绍一些科学技术问题以外，也注意解决一些思想问题。例如《塑料薄膜育稻秧》中，除介绍整地、工具准备、播种、搭棚、苗期管理及塑料薄膜的贮藏保管等经验外，还对薄膜的成本作了具体的计算，以解决农民中“不合算”的思想顾虑。《消灭血吸虫病》和《消灭钉螺》等除介绍治疗病人、消灭钉螺、管理粪便等防护知识外，还介绍了人们对血吸虫病的思想认识的提高过程。
    去年全国科教电影工作会议之后不久，上海科学技术出版社就开始酝酿并组织编辑出版以广大农村读者为基本对象的《农村科技连环画》。他们采取领导、编绘人员和作者相结合的方法，强调突出政治，质量第一。连环画的作者都是在农村工作的基层科技人员。这些《农村科技连环画》读物都是反复征求有关部门和农村干部群众的意见，作了许多次修改才定稿的。
