　　Filling an Important Gap in China's Chemical Fiber Machinery Manufacturing Industry
　　Seventeen Shanghai Young Women Produce 12,000-Hole Spinnerets
    The key component for spinning rayon—a 12,000-hole spinneret with holes finer than a strand of hair—has officially gone into production in Shanghai.

    The spinneret used for spinning rayon is like the head of a silkworm; it is necessary for producing the fiber. Previously, the spinnerets produced in Shanghai had larger holes, which could only spin viscose into rayon staple and rayon filament, but not finer rayon cotton. With this small-hole, 12,000-hole spinneret, this situation can be changed.

    As the number of holes in the spinneret increases, as long as the process parameters of the previous processes are changed accordingly, the amount of viscose fiber ejected can also be increased accordingly. Therefore, the production of multi-hole spinnerets is also of great importance to the development of chemical fiber production and the improvement of labor productivity.

    The multi-hole spinneret was trial-produced by seventeen young women from the Shanghai Chemical Fiber Machinery Parts Factory, with an average age of less than twenty-two. With the cooperation of relevant research units, factories, and other workers in the factory in Shanghai, they filled this important gap in China's chemical fiber machinery manufacturing industry after more than a year of effort.

    The technical requirements for this spinneret are very high. 12,000 holes must be evenly drilled on a gold-platinum blank the size of an ordinary teacup opening; each small hole is so small that even a strand of hair cannot pass through it. The bottom blank and the inner walls of the 12,000 holes are also required to be sparkling and bright, reflecting a person's image.

    The reporter saw this spinneret continuously spraying silk upwards in the acid bath of a spinning machine at the Shanghai No. 3 Rayon Factory. The snow-white viscose silk is smooth and lustrous after being drawn and formed. The factory director told the reporter that the continuous high-pressure impact resistance, hole diameter perpendicularity, and smoothness of this batch of spinnerets are all relatively good.

    The spinneret team of the Shanghai Chemical Fiber Machinery Parts Factory, composed of seventeen young women, has only been established for two years. There are no engineers or technicians in the group. A lathe operator, and two other workers who have worked in spinneret inspection for about a year in other factories, are considered the experts among them. Many people believe that there are no conditions here for trial production and production of 12,000-hole spinnerets.

    After studying Chairman Mao's works, the young women in this group gained courage and learned boldness. They discussed: Chairman Mao taught us that the world is only afraid of the word "conscientious." As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, work conscientiously, we can discover and create something. With tenacious perseverance, they actively explored processes and diligently studied technology, and finally achieved success.

    In order to commend their spirit of bravely shouldering heavy responsibilities, at the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League named this group the Shanghai Red Flag Youth Shock Team.

### 填补了我国化学纤维机械制造工业的一个重要空白　上海十七个女青年制成一万二千孔喷丝头

　　填补了我国化学纤维机械制造工业的一个重要空白
　　上海十七个女青年制成一万二千孔喷丝头
    纺制人造棉的关键部件——一万二千孔的、孔径比头发丝还细的喷丝头，已在上海正式投入生产。
    用于纺制人造棉的喷丝头，好比蚕儿的头，有了它才能吐出丝来。在此以前，上海生产的喷丝头，孔较大，只能把粘胶纺成人造毛和人造丝，不能纺成更细的人造棉。有了这种小孔径的一万二千孔喷丝头，就能够改变这种状况。
    喷丝头上的孔数增加后，只要前道工序的工艺参数作相应改变，粘胶纤维喷出量也可以相应地增加。因此，生产多孔喷丝头，对发展化学纤维生产、提高劳动生产率，也有重要作用。
    多孔喷丝头，是上海化学纤维机械配件厂的十七个平均年龄不到二十二岁的女青年试制出来的。她们在上海有关研究单位、工厂和本厂其他工人的协作下，经过了一年多时间的努力，填补了我国化学纤维机械制造工业的这个重要空白。
    这种喷丝头的技术要求很高。在一只象普通茶杯口大小的金铂坯上，要均匀地钻出一万二千个孔；每一个小孔，连一根头发丝也穿不过。底坯和一万二千个孔的内壁，还要求精光雪亮，照得出人影。
    记者在上海第三人造纤维厂，看到了这种喷丝头在纺丝机的酸浴池里连续不断向上喷丝的情景。雪白的粘胶丝经过抽伸成型，滑润而光洁。这家工厂的厂长告诉记者，这批喷丝头的连续受高压冲击能力、孔径垂直度和光洁圆正度，都比较好。
    由十七个女青年组成的上海化学纤维机械配件厂喷丝头小组，成立不过两年。组里没有一个工程师、技术员。一个车工师傅，另外两位在其他厂做过一年左右喷丝头检验工作的工人，就算是她们中的行家了。不少人认为，这里没有试制和生产一万二千孔喷丝头的条件。
    这个小组的女青年学习毛主席著作后，有了勇气，学出了胆量。她们议论说：毛主席教导我们，世界上就怕“认真”二字。只要按照毛主席的教导去干，认真下功夫，就可以有所发现，有所创造。她们以顽强的毅力，积极摸索工艺，刻苦钻研技术，终于获得了成功。
    为了表彰她们那种勇挑重担的精神，今年年初，共青团上海市委员会命名这个小组为上海市红旗青年突击队。
