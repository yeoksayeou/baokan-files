　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 20th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an article on February 20th, expressing fraternal support and firm backing for the struggle of Indonesian communists and other patriotic and progressive people against the U.S. imperialists and the Indonesian reactionaries, and for the defense of the fruits of the Indonesian revolution.

　　The article emphasized, "In the past, Dutch colonialists and Indonesian reactionaries failed to eliminate the Indonesian Communist Party. Now, the U.S. running dogs, the Indonesian reactionaries' attempts to oppose the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people will not succeed either."

　　The article severely condemned the U.S. lackeys in Indonesia for launching a large-scale and frenzied campaign of terror against Indonesian communists and other patriotic and progressive people since October of last year, and for conducting so-called "trials" of a group of communists starting from February 14th.

　　The article pointed out, "The Indonesian reactionaries and the U.S. imperialists are trying to eliminate the Indonesian Communist Party through large-scale massacres and are doing their utmost to maliciously slander it. However, their conspiracy will surely fail. They cannot erase the fact that is clearly seen by the Indonesian people and the working people of the world: The Indonesian Communist Party is a patriotic and progressive party. It has always been at the forefront of the Indonesian people's struggle for Indonesian national interests and against imperialism, colonialism, and neocolonialism."

　　The article pointed out that the Indonesian reactionaries' frenzied campaign of terror against the Indonesian Communist Party aims to eliminate the party and Indonesia's main patriotic and progressive forces, and to lead Indonesia down the path of dependence on U.S. imperialists. They spare no effort to slander the Indonesian Communist Party, but in the eyes of public opinion, they are precisely the traitors of their own country and the running dogs of U.S. imperialism. Concrete facts have confirmed their ugly faces and the bloody hands of U.S. imperialist interventionists.

　　The article concluded, "The Vietnamese people are deeply indignant at the U.S. lackeys, the Indonesian reactionaries' current frenzied campaign of terror against Indonesian communists and the people, and express severe condemnation. At a time when Indonesia is facing a severe test, all Vietnamese communists and all Vietnamese people express fraternal support and firm backing for the struggle of Indonesian communists and other patriotic and progressive people against U.S. imperialists and Indonesian reactionaries, and for the defense of the fruits of the Indonesian revolution."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 20th: The Albanian "Zëri i Popullit" published an editorial on February 19th, condemning the Indonesian reactionary forces' frantic persecution of the Indonesian Communist Party.

　　The article said that in order to cover up their crimes of massacring Indonesian progressive forces, especially Indonesian communists, and to defend their crimes, the Indonesian reactionary forces are organizing trials in Jakarta. The Indonesian reactionaries, supported and instigated by U.S. imperialism and its servants, are attempting to taint and nullify the Indonesian Communist Party, which resolutely opposes imperialism and colonialism and struggles for the true independence of Indonesia, through this premeditated and untenable trial. They want to eliminate the Indonesian Communist Party because they see that the Indonesian Communist Party is the main obstacle to realizing their despicable goals. They believe that this will hinder the struggle of the people of other Asian countries against imperialism and for freedom and national independence.

　　The article said that at the same time, the Indonesian reactionary forces are also trying to sever the friendly relations that exist between China and Indonesia. They organized Indonesian thugs to continuously attack the diplomatic representatives of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia, massacre and imprison overseas Chinese, and carry out countless other provocations. They are doing this in accordance with the interests of imperialism, modern revisionism, and their followers.

　　The article pointed out that the Indonesian Communist Party plays a huge role in the struggle for national independence and progress, in the international communist movement, and in defending the great ideals of Marxism-Leninism from the frantic attacks of the Khrushchev revisionists, and is deeply loved and trusted by the Indonesian people. No matter how hard the reactionary fascist forces of Indonesia, U.S. imperialism and its collaborators—the modern revisionists—try to eliminate the great influence of the Indonesian Communist Party, their despicable goals and conspiracies will never succeed.

　　The article concluded that the heroic and freedom-loving Indonesian people are undergoing a serious struggle, but they will know how to overcome the dark forces of Indonesia and their supporter, U.S. imperialism. The Albanian people, educated by the Albanian Party of Labor, together with all the righteous people in the world, strongly condemn the new barbaric crimes of the international reactionaries against the true patriots of Indonesia. The Albanian people will always support and support the just struggle and great cause of the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people, and believe that they will finally achieve victory.

　　越《人民报》坚决声援印度尼西亚共产党
　　印度尼西亚反动派的阴谋必将失败
　　阿《团结报》谴责印度尼西亚反动派反共暴行
    新华社河内二十日电　越南《人民报》二十日发表文章，对印度尼西亚共产党人和其他爱国进步人民反对美帝国主义者和印度尼西亚反动派，保卫印度尼西亚革命果实的斗争表示兄弟般的声援和坚决的支持。
    文章强调指出，“过去荷兰殖民主义者和印度尼西亚的反动派未能消灭印度尼西亚共产党。现在美国走狗印度尼西亚反动派反对印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民的企图也不会得逞。”
    文章严厉谴责美国在印度尼西亚的走狗从去年十月以来对印度尼西亚共产党人以及其他爱国进步人民展开的大规模疯狂的恐怖运动，并且从二月十四日起对一批共产党人进行所谓“审讯”。
    文章指出，“印度尼西亚反动派和美帝国主义者竭力想通过大规模屠杀的办法来消灭印度尼西亚共产党，并竭力对它进行恶毒的污蔑。但是，他们的阴谋必将遭到失败。他们抹煞不了印度尼西亚人民和全世界劳动人民看得清清楚楚的事实：印度尼西亚共产党是一个爱国的和进步的政党。它一直走在印度尼西亚人民争取印度尼西亚民族利益，反对帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义的斗争的最前列。”
    文章指出，印度尼西亚反动派对印度尼西亚共产党展开的疯狂的恐怖运动，目的是为了消灭这个党和印度尼西亚主要的爱国进步力量，使印度尼西亚走上依赖美帝国主义者的道路。他们不惜诽谤印度尼西亚共产党，但在公众舆论看来，他们恰恰就是自己祖国的卖国贼和美帝国主义的走狗。具体事实已证实了他们的丑恶面目和美帝国主义干涉者的血手。
    文章最后强调说，“越南人民对美国的奴仆印度尼西亚反动派目前向印度尼西亚共产党人和人民发动疯狂的恐怖运动感到非常愤慨，并提出严厉的谴责。目前正当印度尼西亚面临严峻的考验的时候，全体越南共产党人和全体越南人民对印度尼西亚共产党人和其他爱国进步人民反对美帝国主义者和印度尼西亚反动派、保卫印度尼西亚革命果实的斗争表示兄弟般的声援和坚决的支持。
    新华社地拉那二十日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十九日发表编辑部文章，谴责印度尼西亚反动势力疯狂迫害印度尼西亚共产党。
    文章说，印度尼西亚反动势力为了掩盖自己屠杀印度尼西亚进步力量，特别是印度尼西亚共产党人的罪恶，为了替自己的罪行辩护，正在雅加达组织审讯。得到美帝国主义及其仆从支持和唆使的印度尼西亚反动派企图通过这种预谋的、站不住脚的审讯来沾污和取消坚决反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义，为争取印度尼西亚真正独立而斗争的印度尼西亚共产党。他们想取消印度尼西亚共产党，因为他们看到，印度尼西亚共产党是实现他们的卑鄙目的的主要障碍。他们以为这样就可以阻碍亚洲其它各国人民反对帝国主义、争取自由和民族独立的斗争。
    文章说，与此同时，印度尼西亚反动势力还企图断绝中国和印度尼西亚之间存在的友好关系。他们组织印度尼西亚暴徒对中华人民共和国在印度尼西亚的外交代表机构进行不断攻击，屠杀和监禁华侨，并进行其他无数挑衅活动。他们这样做符合帝国主义、现代修正主义及其追随者的利益。
    文章指出，印度尼西亚共产党在争取民族独立和进步，在国际共产主义运动中，在保卫马克思列宁主义的伟大理想，免受赫鲁晓夫修正主义者疯狂攻击的斗争中，起着巨大的作用，得到印度尼西亚人民的深深爱戴和信任。不管印度尼西亚反动的法西斯势力，美帝国主义及其合作者——现代修正主义者如何枉费心机地企图取消印度尼西亚共产党的伟大影响，他们的卑鄙目的和阴谋永远也不会得逞。
    文章最后说，英勇和爱好自由的印度尼西亚人民正经历着严重的斗争，但是他们将知道如何战胜印度尼西亚的黑暗势力及其支持者美帝国主义。在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党教育下的阿尔巴尼亚人民，同世界上所有正义的人民一起，严厉谴责国际反动派反对印度尼西亚真正爱国者的新的野蛮罪行。阿尔巴尼亚人民永远支持和声援印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民的正义斗争和伟大事业，相信他们必将最后取得胜利。
