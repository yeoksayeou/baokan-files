    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd -- Tokyo Dispatch: The *Mainichi Shimbun* published an article on January 27 by its reporter, Watanabe Jo, entitled "Accompanying Foreign Minister Shiina on His Visit to the Soviet Union," revealing how Soviet leaders are taking advantage of Shiina's visit to the Soviet Union to intensify their collusion with Japanese reactionaries.
    The article said: "Soviet leaders are enthusiastic and serious about approaching Japan." "In the past, the Soviet Union, together with Communist China, had been resisting the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty system. However, it can be considered that the Soviet Union has now joined hands with Japan to adopt a strategy of containing Communist China."
    In discussing Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's statement that "actions that damage Japan's relations with Western powers (implying the United States) are not the way to promote Soviet-Japanese friendship," the article pointed out: "It can be considered that this is the Soviet Union's tacit approval of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, which it used to regard as a thorn in its side, and also a huge change in the Soviet Union's policy toward Japan."
    The article mentioned the warm welcome Shiina received in the Soviet Union, saying that in Moscow in January, the weather was cold, with temperatures around minus twenty degrees Celsius, but the welcome Soviet leaders gave Foreign Minister Shiina was very warm. During Shiina's stay in Moscow, "Foreign Minister Gromyko and his wife accompanied Foreign Minister Shiina in all activities, from welcoming him at the airport to attending ballet performances on the 23rd when Foreign Minister Shiina left Moscow, giving him a warm reception that surprised people." The article went on to say, "It is said that Premier Kosygin, disregarding his doctor's advice, held talks with Foreign Minister Shiina... Premier Kosygin emphasized at the beginning of the talks that 'because of Foreign Minister Shiina's visit to the Soviet Union, Soviet-Japanese relations have entered a new era of friendship and amity.'"
    The newspaper also said with great fanfare that "Soviet-Japanese relations, which had been blocked by an atmosphere of mutual distrust after the war, have been opened up to a genuine era of thaw due to Foreign Minister Shiina's visit to the Soviet Union." "The fact that there is now a channel for discussions between the leaders of the two countries may enable Japan to play a greater role in international politics."

    日本报纸说苏联领导人同佐藤政府打得火热
    苏日亲善是为了“遏制”中国
    新华社三日讯　东京消息：《每日新闻》在一月二十七日刊载了它的记者渡边襄写的一篇《随椎名外务大臣访苏》的文章，透露了苏联领导人利用椎名访苏加紧同日本反动派勾结的情况。
    文章说：“苏联领导人对于接近日本，是热情而且认真的。”“过去，苏联同共产党中国一起，一直对抗日美安全条约体制。但是，可以认为，现在苏联已经同日本携起手来，采取遏制共产党中国的策略。”
    在谈到苏联外交部长葛罗米柯所说的“损害日本同西方大国（暗示美国）的关系的作法，不是增进日苏友好所应采取的作法”这两句时，文章指出：“可以认为，这是苏联对于过去看成是眼中钉的日美安全条约表示默认，也是苏联对日政策的巨大变化。”
    文章谈到椎名在苏联受到热烈欢迎的情况时说，一月间的莫斯科，天气寒冷，气温在零下二十度左右，但是，苏联领导人欢迎椎名外务大臣的情况，却是非常热烈的。在椎名在莫斯科期间，“葛罗米柯外交部长和夫人在这期间，从到飞机场欢迎的时候起到二十三日椎名外务大臣离开莫斯科的时候止，甚至在夜晚观看芭蕾舞等一切活动中，一直陪伴椎名外务大臣，热情接待，以致使人们感到吃惊”。文章接着说，“据说，柯西金总理不顾医师的劝告，同椎名外务大臣举行了会谈，……柯西金总理在开始会谈时强调说，‘由于椎名外务大臣访问苏联，日苏关系已经进入友好亲善的新时代。’”
    这家报纸还兴高采烈地说，“战后被互不信任的情绪所阻隔的日苏关系，已经由于椎名外务大臣访苏而打开了真正的解冻时代的大门。”“日苏两国领导人之间有了商谈的通路这件事情，可能会使日本在国际政治上发挥更大的作用。”
