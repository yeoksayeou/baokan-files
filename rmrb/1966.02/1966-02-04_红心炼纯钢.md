    Hearts of Red Tempering Pure Steel
    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company, Sun Jipeng
    Whenever the clear and resonant sound of the tapping bell rings, the steelworkers watch the steel flowers dancing across the sky and the cascading streams of red-hot steel, their hearts filled with joy and delight! But sometimes, this thick smoke and fiery heat can also bring trouble to people. Right now, the workers of No. 2 open-hearth furnace in the First Steelmaking Plant of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company have something troubling them, tormenting everyone's heart!
    The tapping bell rang, and the workers, while observing the rolling and surging molten steel through the safety glasses attached to their caps, constantly glanced back at the electric clock hanging on the wall.
    "Alas! Slower again, slower again..."
      "How long will this old ox-cart keep dragging on?"
    It turned out that the repair date for No. 2 open-hearth furnace was approaching, and the smelting time for each batch of steel was extended by one to two hours compared to usual. In these days of welcoming the Third Five-Year Plan, learning from Daqing, and catching up with Daqing, how could they not feel anxious seeing their furnace dragging behind like an old ox-cart!
    Cao Xinzhi, the Communist Party member serving as the substitute furnace foreman, felt a mix of emotions in his heart. Alas! Repairing the furnace? That would take at least six or seven days. This veteran worker, who had been circling around the furnace for more than ten years, couldn't bear to be without the sight of molten steel flowing from the open-hearth furnace for six or seven days, or even a minute or second without "smelling" the smoke and "feeling" the heat. At this moment, he really wanted to know how his comrades felt, and nudged his assistant, Lao Jin, beside him with his elbow, "Hey, buddy, it's getting slower and slower!"
      "Yes, the furnace is old, it needs repairing!" Lao Jin said with difficulty.
      "What if we could work even harder in the operation?" Cao asked tentatively.
      "That would certainly be better. But, we'd have to sweat a lot!"
    Lao Jin's words immediately reminded Lao Cao. He recalled that recently, as the furnace aged, everyone's work had become somewhat relaxed, not as tense as before. That evening, he revisited Chairman Mao's teachings on the relationship between people and weapons, and suddenly understood: he secretly blamed himself, sigh! Usually, we always talk about highlighting politics and implementing the "four firsts," how could I forget it at such a crucial moment?
    At this time, the Party branch of the work section also discovered this ideological trend. At the employee meeting the next day, after analyzing the production situation, they raised a question: "Is the furnace slow, or is the thinking slow?" and asked everyone to discuss it.
    At the group meeting, Cao Xinzhi examined his performance of relaxing the operation. Some said: "I thought I might as well let it fall apart, what's the point of dragging it with this old ox-cart?" Some said: "I'm holding the attitude of making do for one more day." Through this discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that the aging of the furnace and the extension of the smelting time were objective laws of things, but as long as the slack mood was overcome, the furnace could be sped up. So they put forward several concrete measures, determined to have a "slow furnace, fast thinking!"
    That day, as soon as the first ray of dawn appeared, Lao Cao rushed to the factory. As soon as he stepped onto the furnace platform, he was immediately attracted by the furnace. "Hey, blink your eyes, and the old hen turns into a duck." The furnace, which was full of holes yesterday, was decorated like a new bride today: the phenomenon of smoke everywhere and air leaks from all sides disappeared; the gaping brick seams were filled with oily and smooth, flat and tidy material... Lao Cao was staring at the furnace, puzzled, when he felt a "slap" on his shoulder. He turned his head and saw it was the foreman of the bricklayers.
      "Hey, how did you become a mud monkey?"
      "Isn't it all for the open-hearth furnace to make steel quickly!" The bricklayer foreman wiped the mud and sweat off his face.
    It turned out that in order to enable the furnace workers to make steel quickly on this "old master furnace," they carried out technical innovation overnight, made a spraying machine with local methods, and put on this well-fitting coat for the furnace.
    The steelworkers were also full of energy. The heat-resistant suits were scorched and yellowed by the flames, but they didn't care; beads of sweat as big as soybeans dripped down in strings, but they didn't bother to wipe them off. Contrary to their usual practice of reducing the furnace pressure by blowing the furnace roof and blocking the furnace door, they braved the scorching high temperature to repair the furnace, charge materials, and take samples. The open-hearth furnace opened its red-hot "mouth", and it was time to "eat" some slag-making materials. Cao Xinzhi, holding a shovel, took the lead and rushed to the furnace door, "swish" he threw a shovel into the furnace, and everyone followed suit, only to see shadows flickering and shovels whizzing... In this way, the workers of Cao Xinzhi's team, with the close cooperation of several brotherly types of work such as bricklayers, gas workers, and furnace guards, finally shortened the time by more than an hour and produced a batch of high-quality steel.
    The new record created by Cao Xinzhi's steelmaking team, like a spark, ignited the fierce fire of competition to catch up with and surpass each other. New records appeared one after another. No. 2 open-hearth furnace, like a winged steed, galloped on the road of socialist construction!

    红心炼纯钢
    马鞍山钢铁公司　孙继鹏
    每当一阵清脆而又嘹亮的出钢钟声敲过，炼钢工人看着漫天飘舞的钢花和瀑布般的赤红钢流，心里是多么的欢快和喜悦啊！但有时，这浓烟和炉火也给人们带来烦恼。眼下马钢第一炼钢厂二号平炉的工人，就有件令人焦愁的事儿，折磨着每个人的心！
    出钢钟敲响了，工人们一面透过吊在鸭舌帽上的探火镜，观察着滚滚翻腾的钢水，一面不时地回头望望挂在墙上的那座电钟。
    “唉！又慢了，又慢了……”
      “老牛破车拖到何时？”
    原来二号平炉的修炉日期快到了，每炉钢的冶炼时间，比平时延长了一小时到两小时。在这迎接第三个五年计划，学大庆、赶大庆的日子里，眼睁睁地看着自己的炉子老牛破车地拖在后边，怎能不揪心的难受哟！
    担任替班炉长的共产党员曹新志，心里更是倒了五味瓶，好不是滋味。唉！修炉吧？起码也得六、七天时间。这个围着炉子转了十几年的老工人，别说六、七天看不见平炉流钢水，就是一分一秒“熏”不到烟，“烤”不到火，心里都象丢了点什么似的。这时，他很想知道一下伙伴们的心情，用胳膊肘捣捣他身旁的一助手老金，“喂，伙计，越来越慢了！”
      “是呀，炉子老了，该修啦！”老金为难地说。
      “如果操作上更抓紧一些呢？”老曹试探地问。
      “那当然要好一些。不过，得淌几身大汗才行！”
    老金这一句话，把老曹一下提醒了。他回想起最近随着炉子老了，大家干活也随着有些放松，不如以前那么紧张了。当晚，他回到家重温了毛主席有关人和武器的关系的教导，恍然大悟：心里暗暗责备自己，咳！平时老讲要突出政治，要落实四个第一，怎么到节骨眼上就忘了呢？
    这时，工段党支部也发现了这一思想苗头，在第二天的职工大会上，分析了生产情况后，出了个题目：“炉子慢了，还是思想慢了？”要大伙展开讨论。
    曹新志在小组会上，检查了自己操作放松的表现后，有的说：“我想破罐子破摔算了，老牛破车再拖它干啥？”有的说：“我抱着能凑合一天就凑合一天的态度。”通过这一讨论，大家一致认为：炉子老了，冶炼时间延长，这是事物的客观规律，但是只要克服松劲情绪，炉子是可以快起来的。于是他们提出了好几条具体措施，决心来个“炉慢思想快！”
    这天，东方刚露出第一线曙光，老曹就赶到厂里来了，他刚踏上炉台，立即被炉子吸引住了。“嘿，眼睛一眨，老母鸡变鸭。”昨天还是千疮百孔的炉子，今天象个新嫁娘似的，被打扮得清清爽爽：四处冒烟、八方漏气的现象不见了；张牙裂嘴的砖缝，被填补得油光水滑，平平整整……老曹正盯着炉子纳闷，肩膀上“啪”地声被打了一掌，他扭头一看是瓦工组长。
      “嘿，你这家伙怎么变成了个泥猴？”
      “还不都是为了平炉快炼钢！”瓦工组长揩揩满脸的泥浆和汗水。
    原来为了让炉前工人在这座“老爷炉”上快炼钢，他们连夜进行技术革新，用土办法做了个喷浆器，才给炉子穿上了这件合身的外套。
    炼钢工人，也一个个干劲十足，防热服被火焰烤得发焦变黄了，顾不上管它；豆粒大的汗珠一串串滴落下来，顾不上揩一把。他们一反往常吹炉顶、堵炉门就降低炉膛压力的习惯，冒着炽热的高温补炉、装料、取样。平炉张开红通通的“嘴巴”，该“吃”点造渣材料了，曹新志手持铁锹，一马当先奔至炉门口，“嗖”地向炉里投了一锹，众人相继跟上，只见人影晃动，锹声嗖嗖……就这样，曹新志小组的工人们，在瓦工、煤气、护炉等几个兄弟工种的紧密配合下，终于缩短了一个多小时炼出了一炉优质钢。
    曹新志炼钢班创造的新纪录，象一个火种，点燃起了你追我赶的竞赛烈火。新纪录相继出现了。二号平炉象匹长了翅膀的骏马，在社会主义建设的大道上扬蹄奔驰！
