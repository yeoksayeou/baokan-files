　　People's Guerrilla Warfare: A Heroic Ode

　　From January 8th to 19th this year, the people and guerrillas of the northern part of Cu Chi District, Gia Dinh Province, South Vietnam, created a glorious victory by annihilating more than 1,600 American aggressors and their accomplices. During those thrilling days and nights of fierce fighting, in this heroic land, every village was a strong fighting fortress, and every person was a warrior who annihilated the American aggressors. What is recorded here is a heroic ode of a small village—Phu Trung village’s first battle against the American aggressors!

　　On January 8th, more than 8,000 American aggressors and their accomplice troops, covered by a large number of aircraft, artillery, and tanks, launched a large-scale "sweep" towards the northern part of Cu Chi District.

　　As soon as the enemy set foot on the land of Cu Chi, they immediately fell into the vast ocean of people's guerrilla warfare, and were beaten everywhere.

　　When the news of the guerrillas in neighboring villages severely damaging the American bandits reached Phu Trung village, the guerrilla fighters in the village were all eager to try, wishing they could immediately join the battle and beat the American devils to a pulp. Although none of them had seen the appearance of the American devils, as long as they thought of the towering crimes of the American aggressors, everyone's heart was filled with the flames of hatred.

　　The guerrillas and the entire village prepared for battle, waiting for the enemy to arrive.

　　That night, several American planes flew over Phu Trung village to drop flares for reconnaissance. The enemies stationed in Binh Duong, Lai Khe, and Trung Hoa and other places also kept firing artillery at the Phu Trung village area. Obviously, a fierce battle was about to come. Sure enough, the next morning, after the American bandits dispatched a batch of F-105 jet fighters to bombard the villages in this area, a battalion of approximately 900 American aggressors, covered by thirty amphibious tanks, advanced towards Phu Trung village. The guerrillas ambushing on the enemy's advancing road kept a close eye on the enemy. Seeing the enemy getting closer and closer, guerrilla captain Wu Chun lowered his voice and said to the team members: "The enemy is coming to our door! Prepare! We must fight beautifully!" Although the number of guerrilla groups was small, each person had to deal with five or six tanks and hundreds of American soldiers, but the team members were full of confidence. Some said: "No matter how many come, we will fight them"; some said, "The more enemies come, the better, and the more will be annihilated!" They aimed the muzzles of their rifles and carbines at the enemy, waiting for the captain to order to fire.

　　The guerrilla fighters let the first few tanks pass, letting them go towards Phu My Hung Township. They said: "Let's leave these few 'dung beetles' to our brother units to fight, we'll hit the ones in the back, to give them a dilemma!"

　　Then two more tanks rumbled over. The fighter A Xu gritted his teeth, turned on the current, and there was a loud bang, thick smoke billowing, and two American tanks were destroyed on the spot, turning into two piles of red-hot scrap iron. Soon, the enemy sent another tank crawling in the direction of the guerrilla ambush, trying to test the guerrilla's firepower.

　　"Ready... pull!" Another mine exploded, the enemy's tank was shattered to pieces, and the fragments flew straight into the air. The enemies following the tank were all stunned, standing there and daring not move forward anymore.

　　At this time, Wu Chun immediately issued an order: "Fire!"

　　"Bang! Bang!" Two American devils fell to the ground in response.

　　"Bang! Bang!" With two gunshots, two more American devils lost their lives.

　　The guerrillas were hidden very cleverly, and the enemy could not find the guerrilla's ambush position no matter how hard they searched, and only blindly fired randomly around, covering two American soldiers to collect the corpses. A Fu and A Ye were quick-witted and quick-handed, and fired at the same time, and destroyed two more enemies.

　　After suffering new casualties, the enemy discovered the guerrilla group's position, and immediately organized troops to launch a frantic attack, and a fierce battle unfolded. Although the enemy's bullets fell like raindrops, the fighters A Fu, A Ye, and Wu Chun still calmly returned fire shot by shot. Every bullet knocked down an enemy. The enemy's first charge was repelled, and they organized a second charge, but could not advance a few steps. Those who died died, those who were injured were injured, and an injured American devil howled and cried because his comrades "did not help him."

　　Wu Chun, seeing the embarrassed appearance of the American soldiers, laughed loudly and shouted: "Look! The American is crying! The American is crying!" Bursts of laughter spread from the guerrilla's position. The enemy's charge was ineffective, and they dispatched tanks to clear the way, covering the infantry to attack. The guerrilla fighter Qi Tong saw the enemy crowded together, immediately went around behind the enemy, and threw out five hand grenades in one breath, blasting the American devils into flesh and blood, and corpses lying scattered on the front line of the position.

　　The enemy launched seven charges, and were repelled again and again. An American devil, taking advantage of A Ye's reloading, suddenly rushed up with a submachine gun. Before he had time to pull the trigger, he was pushed aside by A Ye, and then, Xiang Fu aimed at his chest and fired a burst of bullets. A Ye also took the American devil's submachine gun. Cheers rang out again on the guerrilla position. Then, the guerrillas eliminated several more American devils who rushed up. When the enemy's other two tanks crawled to the front of the guerrilla's tunnel entrance, the guerrillas had long disappeared.

　　In this way, this combat group composed of several guerrillas, relying on their own wit and bravery, killed more than thirty American invading robbers and destroyed three amphibious armored vehicles of the enemy.

　　This was the first contest between the guerrillas of Phu Trung village and the American aggressors. This "successful start" greatly encouraged the guerrilla fighters and people of Phu Trung village. Guerrilla captain Wu Chun said in summarizing the experience of this battle: "As long as we dare to fight, we will definitely be able to defeat the American robbers. Courage is victory!"

### 人民游击战的英雄赞歌

　　人民游击战的英雄赞歌
    今年一月八日至十九日，越南南方嘉定省古芝县北部的人民和游击队创立了一举歼灭美国侵略者及其帮凶军一千六百多名的辉煌战绩。在那些惊心动魄的激战的日日夜夜，这块英雄的土地上，每一个村庄都是一个坚强的战斗堡垒，每一个人都是歼灭美国侵略者的勇士。这里记述的是一个小小的村庄——富中村的游击队首战美国侵略军的一首英雄的赞歌！
    一月八日，美国侵略军和它的帮凶军八千多名，由大量飞机、大炮和战车掩护，开始向古芝县北部发动大规模“扫荡”。
    敌人一踏上古芝的土地，就立即陷入人民游击战的汪洋大海中，到处挨打。
    当邻村游击队痛歼美国强盗的捷报传到富中村的时候，村里的游击队战士们个个摩拳擦掌，恨不得自己马上也投入战斗，把美国鬼子打得落花流水。虽然他们谁也还没有见过美国鬼子的模样，但只要一想起美国侵略军的滔天罪行，每个人的心里就都充满了仇恨的怒火。
    游击队和整个村子作好了战斗准备，等待敌人来到。
    当天夜里，几架美国飞机飞到富中村上空投掷照明弹进行侦察。驻在平阳、来溪和中和等地的敌人也不停地向富中村地区开炮。显然，激烈的战斗就要到来了。果然，第二天早晨，美国强盗又出动了一批F—105型喷气式飞机对这一带的村庄进行狂轰滥炸之后，大约九百人的一营美国侵略军，在三十辆两栖战车的掩护下向富中村进犯。埋伏在敌人进军路上的游击队员们紧紧盯住敌人。眼看敌人越走越近，游击队长五纯压低嗓子向队员们说：“敌人送上门来啦！准备！要打得漂亮些！”游击小组人数虽少，每个人要对付五、六辆战车和成百名美军，但是队员们个个信心百倍，有的说：“来多少，打多少”；有的说，“敌人来得越多越好打，被歼灭的也就越多！”他们把步枪和卡宾枪的枪口对准敌人，等着队长下令射击。
    游击队战士们把走在前头的几辆战车放过，让它们朝富美兴乡开去。他们说：“把这几只‘牛屎虫’让给兄弟单位打吧，我们打后边的，给它来个进退两难！”
    接着又有两辆战车隆隆地开来。战士阿序咬紧牙关，接通电流，只听见轰隆一声，浓烟四起，两辆美国战车当场报销了，变成两堆红通通的废铁。不久，敌人又派出一辆战车向游击队伏击的方向爬来，企图试探游击队的火力。
    “准备……拉！”又一枚地雷爆炸了，敌人的战车被炸得粉碎，破片直飞到半空中。跟在战车后面的敌人个个吓得呆若木鸡，站在那里不敢再前进了。
    这时，五纯马上发出命令：“打！”
    “砰！砰！”两个美国鬼子应声倒地。
    “砰！砰！”随着两声枪响，又有两个美国鬼子送了命。
    游击队隐蔽得十分巧妙，敌人找来找去也找不到游击队的伏击阵地，只是盲目地朝四周胡乱开枪，掩护两名美军上前收尸。阿富和阿也眼明手快，同时开枪，又报销了两个敌人。
    敌人付出了新的伤亡后，才发现了游击小组的阵地，随即组织兵力疯狂进攻，于是一场激烈的战斗展开了。尽管敌人的子弹象雨点般地落下，战士阿富、阿也和五纯仍然沉着地一枪一枪地还击。每一发子弹都打倒一个敌人。敌人的第一次冲锋被击退了，又组织第二次冲锋，但是却前进不了几步，他们死的死、伤的伤，一个被打伤的美国鬼子因为同伙“见死不救”而嚎嚎大哭起来。
    五纯一看美军这种狼狈相，一边放声大笑，一边喊道：“看！美国佬哭了！美国佬哭了！”一阵阵的笑声从游击队的阵地上传播开来。敌人冲锋无效，又出动战车开路，掩护步兵进攻。游击战士七通见敌人挤在一起，立即绕到敌人背后，一口气扔出五颗手榴弹，炸得美国鬼子们血肉横飞，一具具死尸横七竖八地躺在阵地前沿。
    敌人进行了七次冲锋，一次又一次地被打退了。一个美国鬼子趁阿也装子弹的时候，突然端着冲锋枪冲了上来。他还没来得及扣动扳机，就被阿也推倒在一边，紧接着，向富瞄准他的胸部射出了一梭子弹，阿也又顺手把美国鬼子的冲锋枪夺了过来。游击队的阵地上又响起了欢呼声。接着，游击队员们又消灭了几名冲上来的美国鬼子，等敌人的另外两辆战车爬到游击队的地道口前面的时候，游击队早就消声匿迹了。
    就这样，这个由几个游击队员组成的战斗小组，凭着自己的机智勇敢，打死三十多名美国侵略强盗，炸毁敌人三辆两栖装甲车。
    这是富中村游击队同美国侵略军的第一次较量。这次“旗开得胜”的战斗，大大鼓舞了富中村的游击战士和人民。游击队长五纯在总结这次战斗经验时说：“只要我们敢打，就一定能够打败美国强盗。勇敢就是胜利！”
