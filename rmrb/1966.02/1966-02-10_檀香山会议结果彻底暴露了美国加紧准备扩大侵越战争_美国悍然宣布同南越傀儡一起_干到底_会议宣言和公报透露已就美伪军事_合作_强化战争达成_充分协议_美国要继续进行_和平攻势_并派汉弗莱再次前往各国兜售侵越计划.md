    Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch from Honolulu: The two-day talks in Honolulu between US President Johnson and other military and political heads with the heads of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, plotting to strengthen the war of aggression against Vietnam, concluded on the 8th. Following the talks, a so-called "Honolulu Declaration" and a joint communiqué were issued, clamoring that they were "determined to prevent aggression" and "must defeat the Viet Cong."
    This meeting between the US government and the South Vietnamese traitorous clique took place after the peace offensive launched by the United States had failed, the five-pronged offensive launched on the South Vietnamese battlefield had been repeatedly frustrated, and unprecedentedly fierce disputes had erupted within the US ruling clique regarding the policy of aggression against Vietnam. The results of the talks show that under the severe predicament of the war of aggression against Vietnam, the Johnson administration still wants to continue to play the dual tactics of strengthening the war and engaging in peace deceptions, attempting to achieve its goal of aggression and enslavement of the South Vietnamese people.
    At the beginning of the talks on the 7th, Johnson assured his South Vietnamese lackeys that the United States "will see this (the war of aggression against Vietnam) through to the end." He said, "We will never tire. We will never lose heart... We will fight alongside you against the communist aggressors." Johnson proposed that the United States currently has "two prominent goals" in South Vietnam, namely, "to persevere in relentless forward progress on the military front," "to defeat the communists and punish the aggressors," and to implement some deceptive measures in social and political fields.
    The declaration and the communiqué revealed that the two sides "discussed the military situation as well as military plans and programs," and they "reached full agreement on a policy of increasing military efficiency and closer cooperation between South Vietnamese and US military forces." In their respective statements of purpose in the so-called "Honolulu Declaration," the South Vietnamese traitorous clique declared, "The Viet Cong and those who are illegally fighting alongside them in our territory must be defeated." The US government stated that they would "prevent aggression" together with the puppet clique and "firmly guarantee loyalty to this purpose."
    Nguyen Cao Ky said at a press conference jointly held with Nguyen Van Thieu on the 8th that the two sides discussed the issue of the United States sending more troops to South Vietnam during the talks, but no figures were decided. According to Agence France-Presse Honolulu news citing "highly authoritative sources," US Commander in Vietnam Westmoreland requested that 200,000 more American troops be sent to South Vietnam during the talks.
    According to Western news agencies, the specific US military plans "were mainly discussed in secret meetings between Johnson and his own advisors." At the same time, at his three-hour meeting with the South Vietnamese lackeys on the evening of the 7th, attended by Westmoreland, "strategy and tactics" were discussed. According to White House Press Secretary Moyers, at the meeting on the evening of the 8th, "the basic strategic assumptions and tactics were re-examined" in order to "link military plans with social politics to form some kind of unified form."
    According to American newspapers, the issue of expanding the bombing of North Vietnam has always occupied an important position in the talks. Nguyen Van Thieu clamored at a press conference on the 8th that it was necessary to destroy North Vietnam's military and industrial targets. However, the declaration and the communiqué avoided mentioning this issue.
    The declaration and the communiqué show that in order to strengthen their military efforts in South Vietnam, stabilize the puppet regime, and give it a "democratic" veneer, the Johnson government decided to have its puppets implement a set of deceptive "psychological warfare" tricks, namely: formulating a "democratic constitution," "establishing an elected government"; strengthening the "rural construction plan" and "health and education plan"; "combating inflation" and stabilizing the economy; "pursuing a frugal policy" and "properly utilizing foreign aid," and so on. The communiqué said that these plans are "as important as the military combat itself" and that efforts should be concentrated on "selective priority areas appropriately related to the military plans."
    The point in the declaration about "proper utilization" of US aid is obviously a subtle rebuke from the American master to his slaves for rampant corruption. The Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee clearly pointed out on the 4th that US aid to the puppet regime "was widely embezzled by Saigon government officials."
    The declaration and the communiqué show that while expanding the war, the Johnson government will continue to play the "peace talks" trick. The declaration and the communiqué said that the two sides "reviewed" the "intense efforts for peace" made by the United States from Christmas last year to the end of January this year, and "regretted to note that the North Vietnamese government now has no interest in peace at all." "They agreed to continue to seek peaceful diplomatic efforts." With the "understanding and support" of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, "the peace offensive of the US government and the South Vietnamese government will continue until peace is achieved."
    However, on this point, Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky emphasized at a press conference held before the final meeting that the puppet regime will never sit at the conference table with the National Liberation Front.
    Johnson has returned to Washington after the talks. Before returning to the country, he announced that he would send Vice President Humphrey to Saigon to continue the talks with Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky. Humphrey will then go to six other capitals in the Asian region for "visits" to peddle the US plan of aggression against Vietnam.

    檀香山会议结果彻底暴露了美国加紧准备扩大侵越战争
    美国悍然宣布同南越傀儡一起“干到底”
    会议宣言和公报透露已就美伪军事“合作”强化战争达成“充分协议”
    美国要继续进行“和平攻势”并派汉弗莱再次前往各国兜售侵越计划
    新华社九日讯　檀香山消息：美国总统约翰逊和其他军政头目同南越傀儡政权头目策划加强侵越战争的两天会谈，已经在八日结束。会后发表了一项所谓“檀香山宣言”和一项联合公报，叫嚷它们“决心防止侵略”，“必须击败越共”。
    美国政府同南越卖国集团的这次会谈，是在美国发动的和平攻势破产，在南越战场上发动的五路攻势接连挫败，美国统治集团内部对于侵越政策爆发了空前剧烈的争吵的情况下举行的。会谈结果表明，约翰逊政府在侵越战争陷于严重困境的情况下，它仍要继续玩弄强化战争与和平欺骗的两手策略，妄图实现它侵略和奴役南越人民的目的。
    约翰逊在七日会谈开始时，向他的南越走狗保证美国
  “要把（侵越战争）这件事干到底。”他说，“我们决不会厌倦。我们决不会泄气……我们要同你们一起同共产党侵略者作战”。约翰逊提出美国目前在南越的“两个突出目标”，即在“军事方面坚持不懈地向前推进”，“击败共产党人和惩罚侵略者”以及在社会、政治等方面推行一些欺骗性措施。
    宣言和公报透露，双方“讨论了军事局势以及军事计划和纲领”，他们“对一项增加军事效率和南越与美国军事部队之间更紧密合作的政策达成充分协议”。在它们各自申述自己的目的的所谓“檀香山宣言”里，南越卖国集团宣布，“必须击败越共和那些在我们领土上同他们一起进行非法战斗的人们”。而美国政府则表示，它们要同傀儡集团“一起防止侵略”，并且“坚决保证忠于这个目的”。
    阮高其在八日同阮文绍联合举行的记者招待会上说，双方在会谈中讨论了美国向南越增派军队的问题，但是没有决定数字。据法新社檀香山消息引“非常权威的人士”的话指出，侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰在会谈中要求再向南越增派美国军队二十万人。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国的具体的军事计划“主要是在约翰逊和他自己的顾问之间的秘密会议上讨论的”。同时，在他七日晚间同南越走狗举行的、有威斯特摩兰参加的三个多小时的会议上，讨论了“战略和战术”问题。据白宫新闻秘书莫耶斯透露，在八日晚间的会议上，“再次研究了基本战略的假定和战术”，以便把“军事计划同社会政治联系起来，以结成某种统一的形式”。
    据美国报刊报道，扩大轰炸越南北方的问题在会谈中始终占有重要地位。阮文绍在八日的记者招待会上叫嚷，摧毁北越的军事和工业目标是必要的。但是，宣言和公报避而不谈这个问题。
    宣言和公报表明，约翰逊政府为了加强它们在南越的军事努力、稳定伪政权并给它披上“民主”的外衣，决定叫它的傀儡推行一套欺骗性的“心理战”花招，即：制订一个“民主宪法”、“建立一个选举产生的政府”；加强“乡村建设计划”和“卫生、教育计划”；“打击通货膨胀”、稳定经济；“奉行节约政策”、“妥善利用外援”，等等。公报说什么这些计划“同军事战斗本身一样重要”，并且要集中力量用于“同军事计划适当有关的有选择的优先地区”。
    宣言中关于“妥善利用”美援一点，显然是美国主子对他的奴才肆行贪污的一种含蓄的申斥。美国参院外委会主席四日曾明白地指出，美国给伪政权的援助，“被西贡政府人士广泛地贪污了”。
    宣言和公报表明，在扩大战争的同时，约翰逊政府将继续玩弄“和谈”骗局。宣言和公报说，双方“回顾了”美国从去年圣诞节到今年一月底“为和平进行的紧张努力”，“遗憾地注意到北越政府现在对和平完全没有兴趣”。“他们同意继续谋求和平的外交努力”。在南越伪政权的“谅解和支持下，美国政府和南越政府的和平攻势将要继续到取得和平为止”。
    但是，对于这一点，阮文绍和阮高其在最后一次会谈前举行的记者招待会上强调，伪政权决不会同民族解放阵线一起坐在会议桌旁。
    约翰逊在会谈结束后已返回华盛顿，他在回国前宣布将派副总统汉弗莱随同阮文绍和阮高其前往西贡继续会谈。汉弗莱然后将前往亚洲地区其他六个首都“访问”，兜售美国的侵越计划。
