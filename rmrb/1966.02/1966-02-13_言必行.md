    Saying Must Be Followed by Action
    After reading the county Party secretary's article, many comrades said: Whether the county Party committee's leadership can be revolutionized mainly depends on whether the ideological style of the county Party committee's leadership members is revolutionary. Very true! Most comrades understand this principle. The problem now is whether we can achieve "saying must be followed by action, and action must produce results."

    Knowing without acting is not true knowing. Recognizing the great significance of revolutionizing the county Party committee's leadership, if action does not closely follow, it is the same as only praising "Good arrow, good arrow," but not using the "arrow" to shoot the "target" of the problem, and revolutionization cannot be achieved.
    To act, to practice, one must also "think thrice before acting," or even think several times more. Because the unification of people's understanding inevitably involves a process, and moreover, the work is very complex. Therefore, we advocate, on the basis of fully exposing and analyzing contradictions, grasping the essential issues, earnestly changing, ensuring that saying is followed by action, and continuously transforming the subjective world and the objective world in practice.

    言必行
    看县委书记的文章，许多同志都说：能不能实现县委领导革命化，主要是县委领导成员的思想作风是否革命化。说得很对！多数同志也是懂得这个道理的。现在的问题是能不能做到“言必行，行必果”。

    知而不行，未必是真知。认识了县委领导革命化的重大意义，如果行动不紧紧跟上，等于光赞“好箭，好箭”，却不用“箭”去射问题之“的”，就不能实现革命化。
    要行，要实践，还得“三思而后行”，甚至多思几次。因为人的认识的统一，必然有一个过程，何况工作也很复杂。因此，我们提倡在充分揭露和分析矛盾的基础上，抓住本质问题，切实地改，有言必有行，在不断实践中，改造主观世界和客观世界。
