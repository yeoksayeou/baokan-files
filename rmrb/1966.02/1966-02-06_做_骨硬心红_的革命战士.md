    《The Song of Ouyang Hai》 is a revolutionary biography of Ouyang Hai's short life, a heroic epic of a proletarian revolutionary fighter. From this book, I have received a profound education and gained the strength to move forward.
    Under the cultivation of the Party and the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought, Ouyang Hai was tempered into a staunch communist fighter in the crucible of the revolutionary army. He generously dedicated his precious life to rescuing the lives and property of the people. His life was for the people and for the revolution; his death was also for the people and for the revolution. He truly did what he thought: "Live, fight with all your strength for the cause of socialism; die, without changing your expression or losing heart."
    I am the son of a poor peasant, and the nephew of the martyr Ouyang Hai. I want to be a revolutionary successor of the proletariat, follow Ouyang Hai's will, follow his direction, take up his burden, and complete the cause he did not finish. Last year, I also signed up for the army, but because I was too young, it was not approved. However, I was not discouraged by this. After reading 《The Song of Ouyang Hai》, I understood even more that revolution has different divisions of labor, just like a game of chess, the "rook" has the role of the "rook," and the "horse" has the use of the "horse," and all work is for the revolution. Carrying a gun is for the revolution, and holding a hoe is also for the revolution; carrying a gun is a soldier, and not carrying a gun should also be a soldier. I must be like Ouyang Hai, resolutely listen to the Party, and go wherever the Party wants me to go. No matter what position I am in, I must fight with all my strength for the cause of socialism; no matter where I am, I must take root, sprout, and blossom.
    After reading 《The Song of Ouyang Hai》, I also understood that young people must temper themselves into true revolutionary successors, and must go to the most arduous and difficult environments to temper themselves. When repairing the canal, we encountered many difficulties. Sometimes thick fog covered the sky, blinding our eyes, and sometimes it rained, soaking us to the bone. In this harsh environment, I did not complain, did not retreat, and insisted on fighting. I thought, times of difficulty are precisely times to train people, as Ouyang Hai thought: "It's raining, great! This is really a test of whether our Four Firsts are being implemented and whether our thinking can be tough." Sometimes we conduct militia exercises at night, and I get up in the middle of the night and call the militia for an emergency assembly in the dark. The next day, we still went to work, picking heavy work, striking with a sledgehammer, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of fatigue. As soon as we thought of Ouyang Hai's words and deeds in the face of difficulties, we felt a great strength in our whole bodies. We thought: as long as we are tested in great storms, and strictly demand ourselves in daily life, we will definitely be able to train ourselves into "bone-hard, heart-red" revolutionary fighters like Ouyang Hai.

    做“骨硬心红”的革命战士
    欧阳玉祝
    《欧阳海之歌》是欧阳海短短一生的革命传记，是一个无产阶级革命战士的英雄谱。从这本书里，我受到了深刻的教育，获得了前进的力量。
    欧阳海在党的培养和毛泽东思想的哺育下，在革命部队的熔炉里，锻炼成了一个坚强的共产主义战士。他为抢救人民的生命财产，慷慨地献出了自己宝贵的生命。他的生是为人民，为革命而生；他的死也是为人民，为革命而死。他真正做到了他所想的那样：“活着，拼尽全力为社会主义事业战斗，死，脸不变色心不跳。”
    我是贫农的儿子，欧阳海烈士的侄儿。我要做无产阶级的革命接班人，遵照欧阳海的遗志，沿着他的方向，挑起他的担子，完成他所没有完成的事业。去年，我也报名参军，因为年龄还小，没有批准，但是我并没有因此而灰心。读了《欧阳海之歌》，我更懂得了革命有分工的不同，就象一盘棋一样，“车”有“车”的作用，“马”有“马”的用场，一切工作都是为了革命。扛枪是为革命，拿锄头也是为革命；扛枪是战士，不扛枪也应当是战士。我一定要象欧阳海那样，坚决听党的话，党要我到那里就到那里。不管在什么岗位，都要拼尽全力为社会主义事业战斗；不管在什么地方，都要生根、发芽、开花。
    读了《欧阳海之歌》，我也懂得了年轻人要把自己锻炼成真正的革命接班人，必须到最艰苦、最困难的环境中去锻炼。在修渠道的时候，碰到了不少困难。有时浓雾蔽天，眼睛都蒙住了，有时下雨，浑身湿淋淋的。在这种恶劣的情况下，我没有叫苦，没有退缩，坚持战斗。我想，困难的时候，正是锻炼人的时候，如欧阳海所想的那样：“下雨了，好啊！这倒真是考验我们四个第一落不落实，思想能不能过硬的时候了。”有时候晚上搞民兵演习，我深更半夜爬起来，摸黑叫民兵紧急集合。第二天我们照样上工，拣重活，打大锤，不怕苦，不怕累。我们一想到欧阳海在困难面前的一言一行，便感到浑身有了很大的力量。我们想：只要到大风大浪中去经受考验，在日常生活里严格要求自己，一定能锻炼成象欧阳海那样的“骨硬心红”的革命战士。
