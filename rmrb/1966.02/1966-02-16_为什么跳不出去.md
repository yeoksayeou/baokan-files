	Why Can't We Break Free?
	Last September-end, it was the season for the masses to buy winter clothes. The Chunxi Road Department Store in Chengdu purchased a batch of wool yarn. Yang Daoyuan, the business team leader of the knitted goods sales group, instructed after receiving the goods: "Don't put it on the shelves for supply for now, sell it at the beginning of next month."
	"Why are you holding it back?" asked Mu Lianfeng, the administrative team leader.
	"The sales target for our group in September has already been completed ahead of schedule. Wool yarn is a fast-selling product, so keeping it for next month will conveniently contribute to the sales target, right?" Yang Daoyuan replied.
	Hearing this idea, Mu Lianfeng said: "Old Yang, do you know that the entire store's task has not yet been completed? We cannot not sell goods and only take care of our own group!" Realizing he was in the wrong, Yang Daoyuan immediately took the wool yarn to be sold.
	Mu Lianfeng thought she had handled the matter well and happily went to report to the Party Branch Secretary. After she explained the situation in detail, she asked in a tentative tone: "Do you think this matter was handled correctly?"
	The Branch Secretary thought for a moment and said seriously: "Lianfeng, it's good that you can think of the entire store, and it's also right to decide to supply the wool yarn to the masses immediately. However, from the starting point of handling the problem, you still haven't broken out of the circle of purely business viewpoints. Why didn't you think of the needs of the masses first?"
	At this time, Mu Lianfeng suddenly realized: "Oh! Why didn't I think more broadly!"
	Comrade Mu Lianfeng was indeed not thinking broadly at the time. Because she was only considering the sales target and not the needs of the people, nor the Party's political influence. In this situation, whether considering the sales target of the group or the sales target of the entire store, she had not broken out of the small circle of purely business viewpoints.
	Because Comrade Mu Lianfeng raised her opinion, this batch of wool yarn was not held back and was supplied to the masses in a timely manner. The objective effect is good. However, considering problems from a purely business viewpoint like this will inevitably lead to a fall sooner or later. For example, if the entire store's sales task had already been completed at that time, would Comrade Mu Lianfeng have agreed with Comrade Yang Daoyuan's proposal to keep the wool yarn for sale next month in order to contribute to the sales target for the entire store? To truly do a good job in commercial work and serve the people well, one must thoroughly break out of the purely business circle.
	Why can't we break free? We really need to find the reason from the starting point.
	Comrades Yang Daoyuan and Mu Lianfeng, at that time, one was thinking for the group, and the other was thinking for the entire store. In short, neither of them was thinking for the masses. The store and the group, although one is big and one is small, are both small collectives compared to the country and the people. When considering problems, only starting from the interests of the big and small collectives, without the Party in their hearts, without class, without the country, without the people, that is, without politics, naturally they cannot break out of the purely business circle.
	Comrade Mao Zedong requires us to "proceed in all cases from the interests of the people, and not from one's self-interest or that of a small group." Only by setting the starting point correctly can the purely business viewpoint be overcome.

### 为什么跳不出去

    为什么跳不出去
    去年九月底，正是群众添置冬衣的季节。成都市春熙路百货商店购进一批毛线。针织品营业小组业务组长杨道源收货以后，关照说：“暂不上柜供应，下月初再卖。”
    “为啥压下不卖？”行政组长牟连凤追问道。
    “小组九月份的销售任务已经提前完成。毛线是畅销货，留到下月卖，不正好顶一部分销售任务吗？”杨道源回答。
    牟连凤一听是这么个主意，就说：“老杨，你知不知道，全商店的任务还没有完成哩。我们可不能有货不卖，光顾自己小组呵！”杨道源自知理亏，立即把毛线拿去销售了。
    牟连凤自认为这件事处理得好，高高兴兴地去找党支部书记汇报。当她把情况一五一十说完以后，用试探的口吻问道：“你看这件事处理得对吗？”
    支部书记想了想，严肃地说：“连凤，你能想到整个商店是好的，决定把毛线马上供应给群众也是对的。但是，从处理问题的出发点来看，你还是没有跳出单纯业务观点的圈子。为什么就没有首先想到群众的需要呢？”
    这时候，牟连凤才恍然大悟：“唉呀！我为啥就想不宽呢！”
    牟连凤同志当时确是想的不宽。因为她考虑的只是销售任务，而没有考虑人民群众的需要，没有考虑党的政治影响。在这种情况下，不管是考虑小组的销售任务也好，是考虑全店的销售任务也好，都是没有跳出单纯业务观点的小圈子。
    由于牟连凤同志提出意见，这批毛线没有压下来，及时供应到群众手里。客观效果是好的。可是，象这样从单纯业务观点出发来考虑问题，迟早是要跌跤子的。比如说，如果当时全商店的销售任务已经完成，牟连凤同志是否也会同意杨道源同志的主张，把毛线留到下月再卖，以便为全商店顶一部分销售任务呢？要真正做好商业工作，为人民服务得好，就得彻底跳出单纯业务圈子。
    为什么跳不出去？确实要从出发点上找原因。
    杨道源和牟连凤同志，当时一个是为小组着想，一个是为全商店着想。总之，都没有为群众着想。商店和小组，尽管一大一小，但是同国家、同人民群众比较起来，都是小集体。考虑问题的时候，只从大大小小的小集体的利益出发，心里没有党，没有阶级，没有国家，没有人民，也就是没有政治，自然就跳不出单纯业务圈子。
    毛泽东同志要求我们，“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。只有把出发点摆对了，单纯业务观点才能克服掉。
