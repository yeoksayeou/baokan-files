    Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from Melbourne: The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) newspaper *Vanguard* published an article on January 27, stating that the new Soviet leadership's revisionist line of Soviet-American cooperation "to impose on the international communist movement is fundamentally impossible. It is already doomed to fail."

    The article pointed out: The Soviet revisionists "can play new tricks, deceive people here and there, but they cannot stop the revolutionary struggle. The struggle will continue to develop.
    All those who sincerely want revolution have a responsibility to do their utmost to tear off the masks of these people and expose their true face as a fifth column."

    The article said that the Soviet leaders "are collaborators with US imperialism," and "they are inextricably linked to the thorough revisionism of the 20th and 22nd Congresses of the CPSU."

    The article pointed out: "The role played by the Soviet revisionists has proven to be that of a fifth column serving the interests of US imperialism. To effectively serve the interests of US imperialism, they must obtain the support of the international communist movement. They are much more cunning than Khrushchev. They used words much cleverer than Khrushchev. They have managed to deceive some people with their words, and they may still be able to deceive some more. But, in the end, their deception will never achieve its purpose. Those who are now deceived will learn from bitter experience the complete betrayal of Soviet revisionism."

    The article revealed that in order to promote their line of continuing to split the international communist movement and serving US imperialism, the new Soviet leadership, unwilling to accept the failure of the March 1965 Moscow split meeting, is recently preparing to convene the 23rd Congress of the CPSU and preparing to convene a so-called International Communist Conference. The article said: "The real purpose of these actions is to impose the Soviet revisionist line, which is acting as a fifth column of US imperialism, on the international communist movement."

    The article emphasized: "This is fundamentally impossible, and it is already doomed to failure." It said, "There must be no international conference with traitors. Participating in such a conference is supporting the traitors."

    澳共《先锋报》揭露苏共领导继续推行投降分裂路线
    苏联修正主义者是为美帝效劳的第五纵队
    最近他们准备召开苏共二十三大和所谓共产党国际会议，企图把苏联修正主义路线强加于国际共运，这是注定要失败的
    新华社六日讯　墨尔本消息：澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》一月二十七日发表文章说，苏共新领导要把他们的苏美合作的修正主义路线“强加于国际共产主义运动，这是根本办不到的。它已经注定要失败”。
    文章指出：苏联修正主义者“可以玩新的花招，欺骗这里那里的人民，但是他们制止不住革命斗争。斗争将继续发展。
    凡是真心要革命的人有责任尽自己最大的力量撕掉这些人的假面具，暴露出他们的第五纵队真面目。”
    文章说，苏共领导人“是美帝国主义的合作者”，“他们同苏共第二十次和第二十二次代表大会的彻头彻尾的修正主义是难解难分的”。
    文章指出：“苏联修正主义者起的作用已经证明是为美帝国主义的利益效劳的第五纵队的作用。要有效地为美帝国主义的利益效劳，他们就必须得到国际共产主义运动的支持。他们比赫鲁晓夫狡猾得多。他们用了比赫鲁晓夫聪明得多的言词。他们设法用他们的言词骗住了一些人，他们也许还能够再骗住一些人。但是，到最后，他们的欺骗是决达不到目的的。那些现在受了骗的人将会从惨痛的经验中，认识到苏联修正主义的彻底背叛。”
    文章揭露，苏共新领导为推行他们继续分裂国际共产主义运动，为美帝国主义效劳的路线，不甘心于一九六五年三月莫斯科分裂小会议的失败，最近又在准备召开苏共第二十三次代表大会和准备召开所谓共产党国际会议。文章说：“这些行动的真正目的是要把充当美帝国主义的第五纵队的苏联修正主义路线强加于国际共产主义运动。”
    文章强调指出：“这是根本办不到的，它已经注定要失败。”它说，“决不能同叛徒举行国际会议。参加这种会议就是给叛徒捧场。”
