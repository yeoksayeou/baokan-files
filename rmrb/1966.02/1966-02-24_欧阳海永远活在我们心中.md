　　Ouyang Hai Will Always Live in Our Hearts
　　Former Comrade-in-Arms of Ouyang Hai　Zeng Jiefeng
    The novel "The Song of Ouyang Hai" is written with realism and is very touching. As I read it, many past events flooded my mind:
    I was transferred from the artillery regiment to the Third Company on January 15, 1963. Ouyang Hai was also transferred back to the Third Company from the battalion headquarters' communications squad on the same day. Ouyang Hai treated me like an old friend at first sight and was exceptionally warm. He asked me where I was from, when I enlisted, whether I had joined the Youth League, and what my education level was. When I told him I had completed a year and a half of junior high school, he happily shook my hand and said, "Little Zeng, you have such a high level of education, you have more favorable conditions for studying Chairman Mao's works! I think you must be studying well. In the future, you must help me!"
    Ouyang Hai's words warmed my heart. I truly felt both respect and embarrassment. I respected his love for Chairman Mao's works and his concern for his comrades; I was embarrassed because my study of Chairman Mao's works was still far from adequate, and I had not been able to combine it well with reality to transform my thinking. At the time, I thought, how wonderful it would be to live with such a comrade!
    As luck would have it, the company leaders assigned both Ouyang Hai and me to the Seventh Squad. He was the squad leader, and I was the deputy squad leader. I heard that the Seventh Squad was a backward squad, and I was assigned as the deputy squad leader, so my mood was not high. Ouyang Hai was just the opposite. When he heard he was assigned to the Seventh Squad, he jumped up with joy, helping me pack my things while saying to me, "The Seventh Squad is a backward squad, with many problems, and we are going there to solve those problems! The leadership is assigning us to the Seventh Squad because they trust us." I said grumpily, "Do you know that the Seventh Squad is a nail!" He laughed and said, "It's good to bump into a nail a few times! Didn't Chairman Mao say, what is work? Work is struggle. The more difficult the place, the more you have to go, that's what a good comrade does."
    At the time, I was convinced in my heart but not in my words, and I emphasized the objective situation: "Squad leader, you know, I'm an artilleryman, and I don't know anything about infantry work! How can I be a deputy squad leader? If I were just a soldier in the Seventh Squad, I guarantee I could do a good job."
    Ouyang Hai said, "If you have the determination to be a good soldier, you can be a good deputy squad leader. What do you think I know? In the old society, I was a beggar child. If the Party and Chairman Mao hadn't rescued me from the bitter waters, where would I be today! As long as we listen to the Party and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the work will definitely be done well."
    In his work, he was always at the forefront, going wherever it was arduous. In military training, he was meticulous and rigorous, always in the lead and charging ahead; during construction, he always chose the heavy work, and people called him a little tiger, always rushing into difficult places; when comrades had problems they couldn't understand, he would patiently help and enlighten them. The novel gives detailed and moving descriptions of this aspect.
    Ouyang Hai's help to me was even more meticulous. Whenever he studied Chairman Mao's works, he always remembered to call me to study together, saying that my education level was high and that I could help him. In fact, every time it was he who helped me combine the study of Chairman Mao's works with my own ideological reality. Soon after I arrived in the squad, we practiced bayonet drills. I thought to myself, I don't even know how to do it myself, how can I correct the comrades' movements? How can I be a deputy squad leader! Ouyang Hai seemed to see through my thoughts. One evening, he asked me to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" with him. Chairman Mao's words pointed me in the right direction. Ouyang Hai's enthusiasm in helping comrades also encouraged me, gradually clearing my thinking, putting my heart into my work, and becoming more active. Under the old squad leader's warm care and help, my ideological awareness improved step by step.
    On November 18, 1963, when Ouyang Hai jumped onto the tracks to push the horse and save the train, I was at the rear of the whole squad. When I rushed up with the greatest speed, he had already fallen. The train was saved, and the passengers were safely evacuated, but my close comrade-in-arms, my good squad leader, had heroically sacrificed himself. No! His great spirit will always live in our hearts, just as the author wrote in the novel: That straight pine tree stands tall in the sunlight… It appears even greener and more upright…

　　欧阳海永远活在我们心中
　　欧阳海生前战友　曾阶锋
    《欧阳海之歌》这部长篇小说写得真实感人。看着看着，许许多多的往事涌现在我的脑际：
    我是一九六三年一月十五日从炮团调到三连来的，欧阳海也是这天从营部通信班调回三连的。欧阳海对我一见如故，异常亲切。问我是哪里人，什么时候入伍的，入了团没有？多高的文化程度？当我告诉他，我读了一年半初中时，他高兴地握着我的手说：“小曾，你有这样高的文化，学习毛主席著作多有条件呀！我想你一定学习得不错。以后，你可得帮助我啊！”
    欧阳海的几句话，说得我心里热呼呼的。我真又敬佩又难为情。敬佩的是他对毛主席著作那样热爱，对同志那样关心；难为情的是我对毛主席著作的学习还差得很远，没有能很好地结合实际，改造思想。当时我想，能和这样的同志生活在一起该是多么好啊！
    事情真巧，连首长把我和欧阳海都分配到七班。他当班长，我当副班长。听说七班是个后进班，又分配我当副班长，所以，我的情绪不高。欧阳海同志恰恰相反，听说分配到七班时，高兴得一蹦多高，一边帮我整理东西，一边对我说：“七班是个后进班，问题不少，我们就是为着解决问题去工作的啊！领导上把我们分配到七班，这是党对我们的信任。”我没好气地说：“你可知道七班是一个钉子！”他笑着说：“多碰几下钉子也好啊！毛主席不是说过吗，什么叫工作？工作就是斗争。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”
    当时我是心服口不服，又强调客观：“班长，你知道，我是个炮兵，步兵这一套我是擀面杖吹火——一窍不通哇！当副班长怎么成呢？到七班当个兵，我倒保证能当好。”
    欧阳海说：“有决心当好一个兵，就能当好副班长。你以为我会么子？在旧社会我是个讨饭的孩子，不是党和毛主席把我从苦水里救出来，我哪有今天！只要我们听党的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，工作一定能搞好。”
    在工作中，他总是处处走在前头，哪里艰苦他就到哪里。军事训练，一丝不苟，走在前面，冲在前面；施工时专拣重活干，人称他是只小老虎，专往困难地方猛冲猛打；同志们有什么问题弄不通，他就耐心地帮助、开导。在这方面，小说里作了细致动人的描写。
    欧阳海对我的帮助更是无微不至。他一学习毛主席著作，总是忘不了叫我一块学，说我的文化高，帮助帮助他。其实，每次都是他帮助我结合我的思想实际学习毛主席著作。我刚到班里不久，班里练刺杀，我想自己都不会，怎么纠正同志们的动作？我这个副班长咋当啊！欧阳海好象看透了我的心思一样，晚上，他叫我和他一块学习《愚公移山》。毛主席的话，给我指明了方向。欧阳海热情地帮助同志的精神也鼓舞了我，使我的思想逐渐通了，工作安心了，积极了。在老班长亲切的关怀和帮助下，思想觉悟一步步提高。
    一九六三年十一月十八日，欧阳海跃上铁轨推马救车的时候，我正在全班的后尾，当我用最快的速度冲上去时，他已经倒下了，火车得救了，旅客安全脱险，但是我的亲密战友，我的好班长却英勇牺牲了。不！他伟大的精神，永远活在我们心中，正如作者在小说中所写的那样：那棵笔直的松树，在阳光下挺立着。……它显得更为翠绿、挺拔……。
