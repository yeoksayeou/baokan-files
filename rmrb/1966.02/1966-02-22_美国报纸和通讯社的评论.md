　　Comments from American Newspapers and News Agencies
    Saying Castro's anti-China stance is a "milestone in Cuban policy"; saying he used "harshly scolding the Chinese" to "repay" the Soviet Union; saying this approach may also be "preparing for the open split of the communist world into two independent and hostile camps"; believing it is necessary to wait for Castro's "next act in this thrilling drama"; promoting the idea that Castro's slander against China "is not necessarily a lie."
    An Associated Press report from Havana on February 6 stated that Castro accused Communist China of using blackmail in its trade with Cuba, bringing Cuban-Chinese relations to the brink of collapse.
    A United Press International dispatch from Havana on February 6 reported that Fidel Castro today used the same angry language he usually employs against the United States to accuse China of "betraying" Cuba in a controversial sugar-for-rice deal and aiding the American blockade of the island. This was Castro's strongest attack on the Chinese to date.
    The *Washington Star* published an editorial on February 9, with the following summary:
    Fidel Castro's sweeping attacks on the Mao Zedong government leave no doubt that he is aligned with Moscow in the fierce ideological struggle between Moscow and Beijing. Of course, it is difficult for him not to do so. His survival depends on continued assistance from the Soviet Union, which amounts to about one million dollars a day. What would he do if this assistance were cut off?
    Obviously, the Chinese Communists and their backward economy cannot provide Castro with the generous assistance he receives from the Soviet Union. Beijing's decision to halt the sugar-for-rice barter agreement with Havana clearly demonstrates this. Fidel erupted in anger over this, saying that the Mao regime participated in "the economic blockade of U.S. imperialism."
    In any case, Fidel has accused the Chinese Communists of being extortionists, blackmailers, subversive aggressors, hypocrites, cynics, liars, and traitors to the cause of the global victory of Marxism-Leninism. This criticism makes one feel that Castro may soon sever diplomatic relations with Beijing. If he does so, it may foreshadow a split between Mao and Moscow, as Moscow can command Castro's every action.
    *The New York Times* published an article by Richard Eder on February 10, titled "Cuba: In Widening Rift," with the following summary:
    Following Fidel Castro's condemnation of Beijing on Sunday, Cuba is intensifying its fierce dispute with Communist China.
    It is widely believed that Prime Minister Castro's speech was a milestone in Cuban policy, second only in importance to its break with the United States and its alliance with the Soviet Union.
    What is astonishing is the vehemence and gravity of Cuba's accusations – one of Castro's accusations against China was that they attempted to recruit Cuban officers as spies. More importantly, these accusations are being widely publicized domestically.
    Until now, Cuba's official position was that it did not take sides in the internal disputes of communism and, in any case, would not allow these disputes to be publicized. Castro occasionally had disagreements with Russia and China, but never revealed them to the Cuban public, only making occasional hints.
    In his Sunday speech, Castro abandoned all these precedents. He spoke frankly about domestic shortages and had no intention of downplaying the damage that China's decision to sell less rice and buy less sugar might cause to Cuba.
    He condemned the Chinese for distributing propaganda among Cuban officers, saying that this behavior was "exactly the same as what the U.S. Embassy did in our country." He said the question is whether "the most vile methods of pirates, oppressors, and troublemakers currently used by imperialist countries should continue to exist in tomorrow's revolutionary world."
    Beijing recently implied that the Soviet Union and the United States were cut from the same cloth, but now Castro argues that China is a country like the United States.
    Analysts have put forward preliminary hypotheses about why Castro did this. The simplest hypothesis is that he was enraged by China's reduction in rice supplies and by the Chinese side accusing him of lying when he announced a trade volume decrease last month, and he felt there was no point in continuing to conceal the rift.
    Another hypothesis is that, after the Soviet Union tacitly approved his plans to intensify revolutionary agitation in Latin America, perhaps after obtaining further economic assistance from the Soviet Union, he agreed to harshly scold the Chinese as a reward.
    A third hypothesis is that Castro may be planning to purge the government and the army of elements he considers disloyal, perhaps associates of Guevara who disappeared from Cuba last year after a series of disagreements with the Prime Minister.
    *The New York Herald Tribune* published an editorial on February 12-13, titled "A Thrilling Drama Entirely Performed by Communists," with the following summary:
    Fidel Castro has now confirmed what many people suspected. The reason he first lost his temper with Beijing last month was far more than just a disagreement over the sugar-for-rice trade agreement. In the midst of this recent round of verbal battles between Havana and Beijing, he tells us that what is truly heartbreaking is that the Chinese Communists have been trying to subvert the Cuban armed forces.
    Castro may be a liar, as Beijing accuses him; but when he accuses his former Chinese friends of "extortion, blackmail, pressure, aggression, and strangulation" – language previously only used to scold the United States – he is not necessarily lying. His accusations against Beijing suggest that Communist Cuba may be preparing to sever diplomatic relations with Communist China.
    If this is the case, there may be much more behind this extraordinary drama of a red David fighting a red Goliath. Recent rumors from Moscow say that the Kremlin has finally decided to make a final formal break with Beijing. The reasons given by Castro against Mao Zedong may be in preparation for the open split of the communist world into two independent and hostile camps.
    When the time comes to conduct a roll-call vote to judge the issue between Moscow and Beijing, Cuba, as a small country bullied and invaded by a great power, is expected to win the sympathy of other small communist countries. If Castro is asked to further produce evidence of China's betrayal, he may be able to do so.
    We must wait for Castro's next act in this thrilling drama entirely performed by communists.

### 美国报纸和通讯社的评论

　　美国报纸和通讯社的评论
    说卡斯特罗反华是“古巴政策的一个里程碑”；说他用“大骂中国人”来“酬谢”苏联；说这种做法也可能是“为使共产党世界公开分裂成两个独立的敌对阵营作准备”；认为必须等待卡斯特罗的“好戏中的下一场”；宣传卡斯特罗对中国的诬蔑“不一定是在说谎”
    美联社二月六日从哈瓦那发出的报道说，卡斯特罗指责共产党中国在同古巴的贸易方面使用勒索办法，从而使得古巴同中国的关系几乎濒于破裂。
    合众国际社二月六日从哈瓦那发出的消息说，菲德尔·卡斯特罗今天以他通常对美国使用的那种愤怒的字眼指责中国在一笔引起争议的糖换大米的交易中“背叛了”古巴，为美国对这个岛屿的封锁出力。这是卡斯特罗对中国人进行的最为强烈的抨击。
    《华盛顿明星晚报》二月九日发表了一篇社论，摘要如下：
    菲德尔·卡斯特罗对毛泽东政府的大肆攻击使人毫不怀疑，他在莫斯科同北京的激烈的意识形态斗争中已经同莫斯科共命运。当然，他很难不这样做。他的生存要靠苏联继续提供援助，这种援助每天为一百万美元左右。如果这种援助切断了，他怎么办呢？
    显然，中国共产党人及其落后的经济不可能使卡斯特罗获得他从苏联得到的那些慷慨帮助。北京决定停止同哈瓦那的大米交换食糖换货协定十分清楚地表明了这一点。菲德尔对此大发雷霆，说这使毛政权参与了“美帝国主义的经济封锁”。
    无论如何，菲德尔已经指责中国共产党人为讹诈者、勒索者、进行颠覆活动的侵略者、伪君子、犬儒主义者、说谎者和争取马克思列宁主义在全球胜利的事业的背叛者。这种批评使人觉得，卡斯特罗可能很快断绝同北京的外交关系。如果他这样做，这可能预示着毛和莫斯科也将分道扬镳，因为莫斯科能够指挥菲德尔的一切行动。
    《纽约时报》二月十日刊登了理查德·埃德尔的一篇文章，题为《古巴：在扩大裂痕》，摘要如下：
    继菲德尔·卡斯特罗星期日谴责北京以后，古巴在加剧它同共产党中国的激烈争论。
    人们普遍认为，卡斯特罗总理这次演说是古巴政策的一个里程碑，其重要性仅次于它同美国决裂以及同苏联结成联盟的行动。
    令人诧异的是，古巴的指责的激烈和严重——卡斯特罗对中国的指责之一是说他们企图拉古巴军官当间谍。更值得重视的是，正在国内大事宣扬这种指责。
    到目前为止，古巴的官方立场是它在共产主义的内部争论中不偏袒任何一方，而且无论如何不让这些争吵张扬出去。卡斯特罗不时同俄国和中国闹别扭，但从来不曾对古巴公众透露过，只不过偶尔有些暗示。
    在他的星期日的讲话中，卡斯特罗抛开了这一切先例。他对国内的供应不足直言不讳，而且丝毫不打算缩小中国少卖米、少买糖的决定可能对古巴造成的损害。
    他谴责中国人在古巴军官中散发宣传品，说这种行径“同美国大使馆在我国的所作所为一色一样”。他说，问题是，在明天的革命的世界中，帝国主义国家目前所使用的“海盗、压迫和捣乱等最恶劣的手法是否还要继续存在”。
    北京最近暗示苏联和美国是一路货色，但现在卡斯特罗争辩说，中国才是象美国的国家。
    分析家们对卡斯特罗为什么这样做，提出了初步的假设。最简单的一个假设是，中国减少大米供应以及当他上月宣布贸易量降低时中国方面指责他说谎的做法，令他暴跳如雷，他认为继续掩盖裂痕已没有任何意义。
    另一种假设是，在苏联默许他关于加紧在拉丁美洲进行革命鼓动的计划后，也许是在取得了苏联进一步的经济援助后，他同意大骂中国人来作为酬谢。
    第三种假设是，卡斯特罗可能计划清洗政府和军队里面他认为忠诚有问题的分子，也许是去年在同总理发生一系列分歧后从古巴消失的格瓦拉的伙伴。
    《纽约先驱论坛报》二月十二日至十三日发表了一篇题为《一场全是共产党人演出的惊心动魄的好戏》的社论，摘要如下：
    菲德尔·卡斯特罗现在已经证实了许多人怀疑的东西。上个月他第一次对北京大发脾气的原因远不止光是在食糖交换大米的贸易协定上有分歧。在哈瓦那和北京最近这个回合的唇枪舌战中间，他告诉我们，真正令人心痛的是，中国共产党人一直在试图颠覆古巴的武装部队。
    卡斯特罗可能象北京指责的那样是一个说谎者；但是当他指责他的前中国朋友“讹诈、勒索、施加压力、侵略和扼杀”——以前这种语言只用来骂美国——时，他不一定是在说谎。他对北京进行这种指责使人认为，共产党古巴可能正准备同共产党中国断绝外交关系。
    如果情况是这样的话，在这一场红色大卫同红色歌利亚打架的非凡好戏后面，可能还有多得多的东西。最近来自莫斯科的谣言说，克里姆林宫终于已经决定同北京作最后的正式破裂。卡斯特罗提出的反对毛泽东的理由可能是为使共产党世界公开分裂成两个独立的敌对阵营作准备的。
    当到了进行唱名表决来判决莫斯科和北京之间的问题时，古巴作为一个受大国欺侮和侵犯的小国，预计可能会博得其他共产党小国的同情。如果要求卡斯特罗进一步拿出中国背叛的证据，他可能是能够做到的。
    我们必须等待卡斯特罗在这场全是共产党人演出的惊心动魄的好戏中的下一场。
