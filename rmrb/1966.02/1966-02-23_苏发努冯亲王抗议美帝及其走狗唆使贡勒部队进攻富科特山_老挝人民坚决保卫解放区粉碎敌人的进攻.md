　　New China News Agency, Khang Khay, February 22nd—According to a Pathet Lao Radio broadcast on the 21st, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front and Deputy Prime Minister of the Lao Tripartite National Union Government, recently sent a telegram to Prince Souvanna Phouma, strongly protesting the instigation by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys of Kong Le's troops to attack the Phou Kout Mountain area in Xieng Khouang Province.
　　Thao Souk Vongsak, representative of the Lao Patriotic Front in Vientiane, delivered this telegram to Phouma on the 12th.
　　Prince Souphanouvong's telegram pointed out, "This is a conspiracy by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys aimed at nibbling away at the liberated areas and creating a tense situation, in order to create conditions for the direct dispatch of U.S. troops to attack central and lower Laos."
　　The telegram said, "The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys launched the offensive against the Phou Kout Mountain area precisely when there were indications that peaceful negotiations between the three princes were possible due to the sincere proposals of the Lao Patriotic Front. This specifically proves that U.S. imperialism has consistently obstructed the Lao people from negotiating peacefully to resolve national affairs on the basis of equality, sincerity, and mutual respect."
　　The telegram warned that "Prince Phouma and Kong Le must bear full responsibility for all serious consequences arising from this dangerous situation." The telegram stated that the Lao Patriotic Front, the Patriotic Neutralist Forces, and the entire Lao people are determined to defend the Phou Kout Mountain area and other liberated areas. At the same time, it expressed the hope that the three princes would meet and negotiate to realize the principle that the affairs of Laos must be resolved by the Lao people themselves.
　　New China News Agency, Khang Khay, February 20th—Pathet Lao Radio published a commentary exposing the recent large-scale military offensives launched by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against some areas of Xieng Khouang Province and the Saravane and Attopeu provinces in central and lower Laos, and calling on the Lao people to smash the enemy's offensives.
　　The commentary revealed that U.S. imperialism and the Kouprasith-Sananikone clique, colluding with Kong Le, dispatched nearly ten battalions of troops to launch frenzied offensives against the Phou Kout Mountain and Phou Song areas, and concentrated forces to attack some places in Saravane and Attopeu provinces. At the same time, they are building bunkers and strongholds in many places in lower Laos to prepare for the direct entry of the U.S. Army into lower Laos.
　　The commentary pointed out that the Vientiane authorities' "Ministry of Defense" claimed on the 11th that many Lao People's Liberation Army soldiers and North Vietnamese troops were operating on the Bolovens Plateau, and even falsely claimed that there was a convoy in central Laos. The commentary pointed out that whenever U.S. imperialism directs the Lao right-wing group to launch offensives, they incessantly issue slanders against the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to cover up their own war actions, attempting to deceive world opinion.

　　苏发努冯亲王抗议美帝及其走狗唆使贡勒部队进攻富科特山
　　老挝人民坚决保卫解放区粉碎敌人的进攻
    新华社康开二十二日电  据巴特寮电台二十一日广播：老挝爱国战线党主席、老挝三方民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王最近打电报给富马亲王，强烈抗议美帝国主义和它的走狗唆使贡勒部队进攻川圹省富科特山地区。
    老挝爱国战线党驻万象代表陶苏·培拉西十二日已把这份电报交给了富马。
    苏发努冯亲王的电报指出，“这是美帝国主义和它的走狗目的在于蚕食解放区和制造紧张局势的一个阴谋，以便为派遣美军直接进攻中寮和下寮地区创造条件。”
    电报说，“美帝国主义及其走狗发动对富科特山地区的进攻正是在有迹象表明由于老挝爱国战线党的诚挚建议，三位亲王有可能举行和平谈判的时候进行的。这就具体地证明美帝国主义是一贯阻挠老挝人民在平等、真诚和互相尊重的基础上进行谈判来和平解决国家事务。”
    电报警告说，“富马亲王和贡勒必须对由这一危险局势而引起的一切严重后果承担全部责任。”电报表示，老挝爱国战线党、爱国中立力量和全体老挝人民坚决保卫富科特山地区和其他解放区。同时，希望三位亲王进行会晤和谈判，实现老挝的事务必须由老挝人民自己来解决的原则。
    新华社康开二十日电　巴特寮电台发表评论，揭露美帝国主义和它的走狗最近向川圹省和中下寮的沙拉湾省、阿速坡省的一些地区发动大规模的军事进攻，并且号召老挝人民粉碎敌人的进攻。
    评论揭露美帝国主义和库帕拉西—萨纳尼空集团同贡勒相勾结，出动了近十个营的兵力，疯狂地向富科特山和富松地区发动进攻，并且集中兵力进攻沙拉湾省和阿速坡省的一些地方。同时正在下寮许多地方建筑碉堡和据点，为美国陆军直接进入下寮作准备。
    评论指出，万象当局的“国防部”十一日硬说有许多老挝人民解放军和越南北方军队正在波罗芬高原活动，还胡说什么有一个车队在中寮地区。评论指出，每当美帝国主义指使老挝右派集团发动进攻时，它们为了掩盖自己的战争行动，就会这样喋喋不休地发出对老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国的诬蔑，妄图欺骗世界舆论。（附图片）
