    Hold Oneself to High Standards
    1965 was the year of the biggest transformation in my life. It was in this year that I joined the great Communist Party of China and became a proletarian revolutionary fighter. In the past year, under the education and nurturing of the Party and with the help of comrades, I have made some progress in terms of political thought and labor practice, and have also achieved some success in production. The cotton we managed achieved a large-scale bumper harvest. In this year, each person in our bumper harvest group handed over more than 2,000 yuan to the state. The cotton planted in our platoon achieved an average yield of 103 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
    Through more than a year of labor practice, the girls have all become dark, plump, and strong, with calloused hands and bodies full of energy, and their thinking has also become redder. Among the Shanghai youth participating in the cotton bumper harvest group, the number of "Five-Good Workers" has increased significantly, and the number of Communist Youth League members has increased from nineteen to twenty-seven. In this battle, I not only mastered basic agricultural production knowledge and labor skills, but also further established the idea of farming for the revolution. However, measured against a true proletarian revolutionary fighter, I am still far behind. Our thinking is not strong enough, and our yields are still too low. Especially after studying Daqing and Dazhai, the gap is really too wide when compared to ourselves.
    This year is the first year of our country's Third Five-Year Plan. Our platoon, based on a comprehensive summary, has decided to plant 500 mu of cotton this year, with a planned average yield of over 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu. To complete this glorious task, we must first earnestly study Chairman Mao's works, and especially work hard on the word "use". We must use Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for all our actions, and take the heroic images of Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and others as our learning models, so that our thinking can be further improved. Only with strong thinking can we have soaring revolutionary enthusiasm and produce more cotton and grain for the country.
    Currently, we are actively leveling the land and accumulating fertilizer, determined to apply more than 3,000 kilograms of manure per mu to our cotton fields this year, to prepare for a bumper cotton harvest this year. I am determined to hold myself to high standards, consciously strengthen ideological transformation, and arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought to be a communist party member worthy of the name.

    用高标准要求自己
    一九六五年是我一生中转变最大的一年。就在这一年，我参加了伟大的中国共产党，成为一个无产阶级的革命战士。一年来在党的教育与抚育下，在同志们的帮助下，使自己在政治思想与劳动锻炼方面取得了一些进步，在生产上也取得了一些成绩。我们管理的棉花大面积获得了丰产，这一年，我们丰产组每人上交国家二千多元。我们排里种的棉花平均单产达一百零三斤。
    通过一年多的劳动锻炼，姑娘们个个变得黑胖黑胖，满手老茧，浑身是劲，思想也变红了。参加棉花丰产组的上海青年中五好工人大量增加，共青团员由十九人增加到二十七人。我自己在这场战斗中，不仅掌握了农业生产基本知识和劳动技能，而且进一步树立了为革命种田的思想。但以一个真正的无产阶级革命战士来衡量自己，还相差得很远。我们的思想还不过硬，产量还很低。特别是通过学习大庆、大寨以后，对照自己，差距实在太远。
    今年是我国第三个五年计划的第一年，我们排在全面总结基础上，决定今年种植棉花五百亩，计划平均单产皮棉一百五十斤以上。要完成这项光荣任务，首先要认真学习毛主席著作，特别要在用字上狠下功夫。我们要以毛泽东思想作为自己一切行动的指南，以雷锋、王杰等英雄形象作为自己学习榜样，使自己的思想得到进一步提高。只有思想过得硬，才有冲天的革命干劲，为国家生产出更多的棉花和粮食。
    目前我们正在积极平地积肥，决心在我们棉花田里每亩施上厩肥三千公斤以上，为今年棉花丰产作好准备。我决心用高标准要求自己，自觉地加强思想改造，用毛泽东思想来武装自己，做一个名副其实的共产党员。
