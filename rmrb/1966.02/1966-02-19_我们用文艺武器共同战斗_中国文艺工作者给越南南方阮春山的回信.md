        We Use Literary and Artistic Weapons to Fight Together
        -- A Reply from Chinese Literary and Art Workers to Nguyen Xuan Son of South Vietnam

    In the letter from Comrade Nguyen Xuan Son, a dancer of the Art Troupe of the People's Armed Forces in the Central and Southern Regions of South Vietnam, to Chinese literary and art workers (published on page 6 of this newspaper on the 15th), he earnestly hoped to see a reply from Chinese literary and art workers. Comrades Chen Kezheng and Xue Tian of the Song and Dance Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Comrade Li Yilan of the China Pingju Opera Theatre quickly wrote replies to Comrade Nguyen Xuan Son. These two replies are now published here. - Editor

Dear Comrade Nguyen Xuan Son:

    Upon reading your letter, we could not contain our inner excitement. We seemed to see: the letter from the heroic land still bearing dust and gunpowder, still stained with sweat and smoke.

    Reading your letter, filled with revolutionary spirit, we seemed to hear the sounds of your battles. Reading your letter, overflowing with revolutionary optimism, we seemed to see the smiles of your victory. Your letter, filled with sincere friendship, once again deeply moved and educated us.

    Dear Comrade Xuan Son, our two countries, China and Vietnam, are connected by mountains and rivers. We are as close as lips and teeth, as inseparable as flesh and blood. We drink from the same river and burn the same firewood. We are neighbors, brothers, and comrades-in-arms. We share a common history of suffering, and we have a common, ferocious enemy.

    Every time the bombs of the American bandits fall on Vietnamese soil, we feel as if they are falling on our own hearts. Every time the American bandits massacre the people of South Vietnam, we feel as if they are massacring our own parents, brothers, and sisters. Every time the American bandits inhumanely release poisonous agents in South Vietnam, we feel as if the Japanese invaders of the past are destroying our fields and villages. Old and new hatreds rise in our hearts together. And every time the heroic Vietnamese soldiers and civilians launch a victorious attack, defeating the American bandits and sending them fleeing in disarray, we sing aloud, cheer and shout, cheering that the Vietnamese brothers are fighting well!

    When the news of the heroic son of the Vietnamese people, Nguyen Van Troi, being murdered reached our ears, we could not help but shed tears of sorrow. However, we saw the dignity of a nation in Nguyen Van Troi, and with unparalleled pride, we made a steel-like oath: to live like him.

    Dear Comrade Xuan Son! The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people constantly inspires and educates us. Inspired by the great revolutionary spirit of the Vietnamese people, we have taken up literary and artistic weapons and plunged into the vigorous movement to aid Vietnam and resist America. The feeling of each of our comrades is like that of a soldier, truly "with anger-filled bullets loaded in the rifle, and hatred for the enemy congealed on the bayonet." We participated intensely in the creation and rehearsal of programs such as *Coconut Grove Fire*. Some comrades stayed up all night, and some comrades persevered in their work despite illness. The rehearsal room was full of pictures of the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist America, and the walls were covered with fighting slogans: "Support the Vietnamese people's struggle to resist America and save the country with practical actions." During creation and rehearsal, when tired, thinking of the suffering relatives in Vietnam, we were immediately filled with strength; when sleepy, thinking of the comrades fighting in the jungle, we were instantly revitalized. This is how we conducted creation, rehearsal, and performance.

    Dear Comrade Xuan Son: We know that the programs we have created and performed are far from able to express the great revolutionary spirit, the heroic spirit, and the indomitable fighting will of the Vietnamese people. In the future, we must learn even more deeply from the heroic Vietnamese people, learn from the literary and art workers fighting in South Vietnam, and use our literary and artistic weapons to fight shoulder to shoulder with our dear Vietnamese comrades-in-arms. We firmly believe that no matter how many planes and cannons the enemy has, no matter how many plots and schemes the enemy has, they will be completely defeated in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people.

    Salute to the heroic Vietnamese people, salute to the fighting literary and artistic soldiers of South Vietnam.

Dear Comrade Nguyen Xuan Son:

    First, please allow me to extend my warmest greetings to the comrades and comrades-in-arms fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle.

    I have seen your enthusiastic and inspiring letter, filled with emotion, sent from the fighting jungles of South Vietnam, from the smoke-filled front lines of the anti-American battle. The comrades in our theater are all eagerly passing it around, and everyone says in unison that this is not an ordinary letter. It is a report of victory from the great Vietnamese people's heroic struggle against America, it is a great and profound exchange of friendship between the people of China and Vietnam, and it is a moving new chapter in the fighting life of Vietnamese literary and art soldiers.

    I am an actor in the China Pingju Opera Theatre, and I am also the actor who played Feng Da Niang in the Pingju opera *Southern烈火 (Southern Fire)* that you mentioned in your letter. It is my greatest happiness that our songs can reach your ears, and this is why I want to write this reply as soon as possible.

    Although I am in Beijing, my heart has long since flown to your side. Every day, I am listening to the news of Vietnamese battle victories, reading in newspapers and magazines how many American planes you shot down today, what places you raided, and how many American devils you killed... Recently, the blackboard newspaper in our theater has been publishing your every victory with huge headlines almost every day. Your every victory is inspiring us.

    The comrades in our theater are all revolutionary literary and art workers, and we have all taken up literary and artistic weapons and plunged into battle. We have successively rehearsed and performed *Southern烈火 (Southern Fire)*, *阮文追 (Nguyen Van Troi)*, and the short drama *战士在槟榔树下 (Soldiers Under the Betel Nut Tree)*. After these programs were staged, the audience was very enthusiastic, not because we performed well, but because the people of Beijing are very concerned about the struggle of the Vietnamese brothers, so they also like to watch programs that reflect your struggle. In the past year, whenever our theater publicly performs these dramas, it is always a full house. This can only illustrate one point, that the great and fighting friendship between the people of China and Vietnam is closely related and everlasting. In the rehearsal process, the theater leaders proposed that the rehearsal hall is the battlefield. Rehearsing a drama to aid Vietnam and resist America one day earlier is like eliminating one more enemy force and shooting down one more enemy plane... We are all rehearsing with deep-seated hatred for American imperialism, especially as your victorious reports fly in like snowflakes, which is a huge driving force in our rehearsal. Even so, we still feel that we have many shortcomings and need to work harder to better reflect and express the glorious deeds of the heroic Vietnamese people.

    Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day." This famous saying has been proven in Vietnam, in China, and in the great revolutionary torrent of the world. American imperialism is retreating step by step in the face of the thirty million heroic Vietnamese people, trembling with fear. Their doomsday is here, and the dawn of victory is just around the corner.

    Recently, the head of American imperialism and the South Vietnamese puppets conducted conspiratorial activities in Honolulu to expand the war. All the Chinese people are on standby. If American imperialism dares to invade, we will annihilate them one by one, fight them pair by pair, and eliminate as many as come, and we will never stop until we win a complete victory. The people of Vietnam and China and the people of the world can completely defeat our common enemy – the world gendarme, American imperialism.

    Tonight, I and the comrades in the theater will perform *阮文追 (Nguyen Van Troi)* for all the representatives of the poor and lower-middle peasants in Beijing. Tomorrow, we will perform to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the unification of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces, and the day after tomorrow, we will perform for the people of the capital. These performances are an unparalleled honor for me and the actors in the theater.

    The performance time is approaching, so I hurriedly wrote this letter to send you my most sincere greetings.

    Sincerely,
Your Comrade-in-Arms, Actor of the China Pingju Opera Theatre Li Yilan
    February 14, 1966, Beijing

### 我们用文艺武器共同战斗——中国文艺工作者给越南南方阮春山的回信

专栏：革命书信

    我们用文艺武器共同战斗
    ——中国文艺工作者给越南南方阮春山的回信
    越南南方中部南区人民武装力量文工团舞蹈演员阮春山同志给中国文艺工作者的来信里，（刊本报十五日六版）殷切希望看到中国文艺工作者的回信。中国人民解放军总政治部文工团歌舞团陈克正、薛天等同志，中国评剧院李忆兰同志很快给阮春山同志写了回信。现将这两封回信发表在这里。编者亲爱的阮春山同志：
    看到了你的来信，我们抑制不住内心的激动。我们仿佛看到：这封来自英雄国土的信上，还沾着尘土和火药，还染着汗迹和烟痕。
    我们读着你那充满革命精神的信，好象听到了你们战斗的声音。我们读着你那洋溢着革命乐观主义的信，好象看到了你们胜利的笑容。你那饱含着真挚友情的信啊，又一次深深地感动和教育了我们。
    亲爱的春山同志，我们中越两国，山连着山，水连着水。唇齿相依，骨肉难分，我们同饮一江水，同烧一山柴。我们是邻邦，是兄弟，是战友。我们有共同的苦难的遭遇，我们有共同的凶恶的敌人。
    每当美国强盗的炸弹落在越南的国土，我们就感到，好象落在自己的心头。每当美国强盗屠杀越南南方人民，我们就感到，好象在屠杀我们的父母兄妹一样。每当美国强盗在越南南方，惨无人道地施放毒剂的时候，我们就感到，好象当年的日本侵略者，正在毁灭我们的田园和村庄。新仇旧恨，一齐从心头升起。而每当英雄的越南军民，胜利出击，打得美国强盗丢盔卸甲，一败涂地的时候，我们就放声高唱，振臂欢呼，欢呼越南兄弟打得好！
    当越南人民的英雄儿子——阮文追被杀害的消息传到我们的耳边，我们忍不住流下了悲痛的眼泪。但是，我们从阮文追身上看到了一个民族的尊严，我们以无比自豪的心情，立下了钢铁般的誓言：要象他那样生活。
    亲爱的春山同志！越南人民的英勇斗争，时刻在鼓舞着我们，教育着我们。我们在越南人民伟大的革命精神感召下，拿起了文艺武器，投入轰轰烈烈的援越抗美运动。我们每个同志的心情象战士一样，真是“枪膛里压满了愤怒的子弹，刺刀上凝结着对敌的仇恨。”我们紧张地参加了《椰林怒火》等节目的创作和排练。有的同志彻夜不眠，有的同志带病坚持工作。排练室里挂满了越南人民抗美斗争的图片，墙壁上贴满了战斗的标语口号：“以实际行动，支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争”。创作、排练中，累了，想到越南受难的亲人，立刻浑身是劲；困了，想想丛林中战斗的战友，顿时精神倍增。我们就是这样进行着创作、排练和演出的。
    亲爱的春山同志：我们知道，我们所创作和演出的节目，还远远不能把越南人民伟大的革命精神，豪迈的英雄气概，不屈的战斗意志表现出来。今后我们一定要更加深入地向英雄的越南人民学习。向越南南方战斗的文艺工作者学习，用我们的文艺武器，同亲爱的越南战友一起并肩战斗。我们深信，不管敌人有多少飞机大炮，不管敌人有多少阴谋诡计，在英雄的越南人民面前，它们都将彻底失败。
    向英勇的越南人民致敬，向战斗的越南南方文艺战士致敬。
              此致
    战斗的敬礼
    中国人民解放军总政治部文工团歌舞团
      陈克正　薛天　高春生　陆祖龙
      刘有傪　刘英　寇家伦亲爱的阮春山同志：
    首先请允许我向战斗在抗美斗争的最前线的战友们，同志们，致以最亲切的问候。
    我看到了您从战斗的越南南方丛林，从硝烟弥漫的抗美战斗最前哨寄来的热情洋溢、激动人心的来信。我们剧院的同志们都互相争先恐后地传阅着，大家异口同声地说，这不是一封普普通通的信件，它是伟大的越南人民英勇抗美斗争的捷报，它是中越两国人民伟大的和深厚的情谊大交流，它是越南文艺战士战斗生活中动人的新乐章。
    我是中国评剧院的演员，也正是您在信中提到的评剧《南方烈火》中扮演凤大娘的演员，我们的歌声能传到你们的耳边，这是我最大的幸福，这也是我所以要尽快地写这封回信的原因。
    我虽然身在北京，可是我的心，早已飞到你们的身边。我每天都在倾听着越南战斗胜利的消息，从报刊上看看你们今天又揍下了多少架美国飞机，又奇袭了什么地方！又打死了多少美国鬼子，……我们剧院的黑板报最近一个时期，几乎每天都用斗大的标题，刊载着你们每一个胜利捷报。你们的每一个胜利，都在鼓舞着我们。
    我们剧院的同志们都是革命的文艺工作者，我们都拿起文艺的武器投入了战斗。我们先后排演了《南方烈火》、《阮文追》和小型剧目《槟榔树下的战士》。这些节目上演后观众非常踊跃，并不是我们演得好，而是北京的人民非常关切越南兄弟的斗争，所以也喜欢看反映你们斗争的节目。近一年来，只要我们剧场公演这些剧目，总是场场满座。这只能说明一个问题，就是中越两国人民伟大的、战斗的友谊是息息相关、万古长青的。我们在排演过程中，剧院领导提出排演场就是战场，早一天排好一出援越抗美斗争的剧目，就好似多消灭一股敌人，多揍下一架敌机……我们都是带着对美帝刻骨仇恨进行排演的，尤其是你们胜利的捷报象雪片般地飞来，更是我们排演中巨大的推动力量。虽然如此，我们仍然感到我们还有许多不足之处，需要进一步地努力，来更好地反映和表现英雄的越南人民光辉事迹。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说过：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”，在越南，在中国，在世界革命的大洪流里都证实了这句名言。美帝国主义在三千万英勇的越南人民面前，节节败退，心惊胆战，他们的末日到了，胜利的曙光就在眼前。
    最近美帝国主义头子和南越傀儡在檀香山进行扩大战争的阴谋活动，我们全中国人民，正在严阵以待，如果美帝国主义胆敢来犯，我们将和你们一样，来一个歼一个，来一对打一双，来多少就消灭多少，不获全胜，决不收兵。越中两国人民和世界人民，是完全可以打败我们共同的敌人——世界宪兵美帝国主义的。
    今天晚上我和剧院的同志们演出《阮文追》，是为北京市贫下中农代表大会全体代表们演出的，明天将要为庆祝越南南方解放武装力量统一五周年纪念日而演出，后天为首都人民公演，这些演出对我和剧院的演员们来说，都是无尚的光荣。
    演出的时间快到了，我匆忙地写了这封信，向你们致以最真挚的问候。
    此致敬礼你们的战友、中国评剧院演员　李忆兰
    一九六六年二月十四日北京
