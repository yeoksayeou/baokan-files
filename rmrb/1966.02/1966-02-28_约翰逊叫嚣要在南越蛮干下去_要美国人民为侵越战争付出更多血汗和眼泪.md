　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 27th -- U.S. President Johnson stated at a press conference held at the White House on the 26th that he would continue to increase troops in South Vietnam and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. He said, "We are determined to do everything we think we should do there."
    At the same time, he had to admit that the United States faced "a long and arduous road" in Vietnam, and he demanded that the American people pay more "blood, sweat, and tears."
    Johnson said that during the Honolulu conference, Westmoreland had already requested him to increase troops in South Vietnam. He said that he had already acted on Westmoreland's request and that he anticipated further requests in the summer.
    Despite repeated disastrous defeats in the war of aggression against Vietnam and increasingly fierce disputes within the U.S. ruling clique over methods of aggression against Vietnam, Johnson still expressed the U.S.'s determination to continue, and he demanded that members of Congress who opposed his approach adopt a "sensible" attitude. Democratic Senator Morse had proposed revoking the resolution passed by the U.S. Congress in August 1964 authorizing the U.S. President to take any action in Vietnam. When asked about this resolution at the press conference, Johnson replied arrogantly that he did not necessarily need the resolution to take actions to expand the war in South Vietnam. He also emphasized that even if Congress rescinded this resolution, he "would still have the right to fulfill our obligations there."
    While clamoring to continue expanding the aggression, Johnson himself also expressed a lack of confidence in the future of the war of aggression. He repeatedly emphasized, "There will continue to be a long and arduous road ahead. ... This will not be easy, this will not be short-term. This will be arduous and require sacrifice."
    At the same time, Johnson continued to play the trick of peace deception, saying that the United States' goals in Vietnam were "limited" and that the United States sought a "just and decent peace."
    Johnson stated that in order to cope with the needs of the war of aggression against Vietnam, he would have to cancel the U.S. government's promised tax cuts and declared that he did not rule out the possibility of using tax increases to increase government revenue.

### 约翰逊叫嚣要在南越蛮干下去  要美国人民为侵越战争付出更多血汗和眼泪

　　约翰逊叫嚣要在南越蛮干下去
    要美国人民为侵越战争付出更多血汗和眼泪
    新华社二十七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊二十六日在白宫举行的记者招待会上表示要继续增兵南越，扩大侵越战争，他说，“我们决心去干我们认为在那里应该干的一切。”
    同时，他不得不承认，美国在越南面临“一条长期而艰苦的道路”，他要求美国人民付出更多的“血、汗和眼泪”。
    约翰逊说，在檀香山会议期间，威斯特摩兰已经向他提出增兵南越的要求。他说，他已经就威斯特摩兰的要求采取了行动，他预料夏天还会提出进一步的要求。
    尽管侵越战争不断遭到惨败，美国统治集团内部围绕侵略越南的方法问题发生了日益激烈的争吵，约翰逊仍然表示美国决心要干下去，并且要求那些反对他的做法的国会议员采取“明智”的态度。民主党参议员莫尔斯曾经提出要求撤销美国国会在一九六四年八月通过的授权美国总统可以在越南采取任何行动的决议。在记者招待会上有人问到这个决议时，约翰逊横蛮地回答说，他不一定需要这个决议才能在南越采取扩大战争的行动。他还强调说，即使国会取消这一决议，他“仍然有权履行我们在那里的义务。”
    在叫嚣要继续扩大侵略的同时，约翰逊自己对于侵略战争的前途也表示没有信心。他反复强调说，“前面将继续有一段漫长而艰巨的道路。……这将不是轻而易举的，这将不是短期的。这将是艰巨的，需要作出牺牲”。
    同时，约翰逊还继续玩弄和平欺骗的一手，说什么美国在越南的目标是“有限的”，美国谋求的是“公正的体面的和平”。
    约翰逊表示，为了应付侵越战争的需要，他将不得不取消美国政府许下的减税诺言，并且声明不排除用增税的办法来增加政府收入的可能。
