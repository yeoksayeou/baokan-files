    Editor's Note
    Since the publication of the novel "Ouyang Hai's Song," it has been widely welcomed by readers. The towering image of the communist fighter Ouyang Hai, as well as his revolutionary ideals embracing the world and his noble qualities of wholeheartedly serving the revolution, have deeply moved readers. "Ouyang Hai's Song" is a high-level generalization of the spiritual outlook of thousands of revolutionary fighters who have studied Chairman Mao's works and highlighted politics; it is a typical reflection of Lei Feng-style, Wang Jie-style, and Ouyang Hai-style heroes in real life. It is generating a tremendous influence among the masses, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking.
    Today, this newspaper publishes the minutes of a symposium of young people from the Baicheng, Dongshan, and Lianhe brigades in Ouyang Hai's hometown of Guiyang County, Hunan Province, and an article by Ouyang Hu, the fourth younger brother of martyr Ouyang Hai, who is currently serving in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Both unanimously believe that this is a good work that shines with a strong spirit of the times and has profound practical educational significance. They expressed their determination to learn from Ouyang Hai's noble qualities of being neither afraid of hardship nor death. Like Ouyang Hai, they will creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and consciously transform their thinking; like Ouyang Hai, they will demand themselves and treat comrades with a revolutionary spirit, and face difficulties and create the future with revolutionary ambition; like Ouyang Hai, they will have the motherland in their hearts, the world in their sights, and serve the people wholeheartedly. It can be seen from this that Ouyang Hai's heroic example will educate more readers and generate tremendous material strength among them.

    编者的话
    长篇小说《欧阳海之歌》出版以后，受到读者的普遍欢迎。共产主义战士欧阳海的高大形象，以及他那胸怀世界的革命理想和一心为革命的崇高品质，强烈地感染了读者。《欧阳海之歌》是千百万革命战士大学毛主席著作、突出政治以来的精神面貌的高度概括，是现实生活中雷锋式、王杰式、欧阳海式的英雄人物的典型化的反映；它正在群众中产生巨大的影响，促进人的思想革命化。
    今天本报发表的欧阳海的家乡湖南省桂阳县白城、东山、联合等大队的青年们的座谈会纪要，和现在中国人民解放军服役的欧阳海烈士的四弟欧阳湖的文章，都一致认为这是一部闪烁着强烈的时代精神，有着深刻的现实教育意义的好作品。他们表示：一定要学习欧阳海一不怕苦、二不怕死的崇高品质。象欧阳海那样活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地改造思想；象欧阳海那样，以革命的精神要求自己，对待同志，以革命的志气对待困难，创造未来；象欧阳海那样，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，全心全意地为人民服务。从这里可以看出：欧阳海的英雄榜样，将会教育更多的读者，并在他们中间产生巨大的物质力量。
