    Hanoi, February 9th (Xinhua) – According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the "People's Liberation Armed Forces Newspaper," the organ of the South Vietnam People's Liberation Armed Forces, recently published a commentary pointing out that the American aggressors have sent a large number of troops to South Vietnam, but over the past year, they have not only failed to save their passive and embarrassing situation but have suffered even more severe defeats. 1966 will be a year in which the American aggressors' situation becomes even more miserable.
    The commentary pointed out that after a year of competition, the American invading army has nakedly exposed its insurmountable weaknesses. American steel is absolutely no match for the heroic nation and the army's strong and unyielding fighting spirit.
    The commentary said that last year, the United States sent its Marine Corps, airborne paratroopers, infantry, and so-called "air cavalry" and other "elite" troops to South Vietnam to fight. However, these invading troops, whether stationed in that solid stronghold, hidden deep in that city, or operating in armored vehicles under the cover of aircraft and artillery, could not escape the fate of being annihilated. They were annihilated from entire squads and platoons to entire companies, battalions, and even entire combat teams.
    The commentary said that last year, as soon as the U.S. Marine Corps set foot on the land of South Vietnam, before they could even get their feet firmly planted, the military and civilians of Quang Nam Province gave them a head-on blow in the Thanh Son battle. In the Van Tuong battle, they were again severely wounded and suffered heavy casualties, with corpses scattered everywhere. The U.S. 101st Airborne Division and 173rd Airborne Brigade in Thuan Ninh, Ben Cat, and the D Zone, and the 1st Infantry Division in Bao Bang and Dau Tieng, were beaten black and blue by the Liberation Army and were in a very sorry state. The 1st Cavalry Division, which was heavily touted by the United States as an "ace force," also suffered heavy blows from the Liberation Army in the Plei Me area.
    The commentary said that the facts have shown that no matter what kind of arm or service the United States has, and no matter how "elite," "mobile," or "good at fighting" it is, it cannot escape the severe punishment of the South Vietnamese people and army. The more American invading troops are sent into South Vietnam, the more will be annihilated.
    The commentary said that the American aggressors also pinned their hopes on the dry season. In the early stages of the dry season, the United States concentrated the 1st Cavalry Division and the 1st Infantry Division in the two "key" areas of Plei Me and D Zone-Ben Cat, vainly attempting to carry out a "counter-offensive." However, it was in these two areas that the American invading army suffered the most serious defeats. In Plei Me, from November 1st to 18th last year alone, the South Vietnam Liberation Army annihilated an entire battalion, two companies, and seven platoons of the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division, totaling more than 1,700 people. In the D Zone-Ben Cat, Dau Tieng and other places, more than 7,000 American and puppet troops were annihilated from the beginning of November to the beginning of December last year alone.
    The commentary said that after the great victories in the rainy season, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces gave the American invading army a heavy blow at the beginning of the dry season. They fought fiercely, accurately, and ruthlessly, attacking here and attacking there, one after another. The failure of the American invading army in the early stages of the dry season is a sign that its "dry season counter-offensive" plan will inevitably be completely bankrupt.
    The commentary concluded by saying that U.S. imperialism is planning to continue sending troops to South Vietnam, but no matter whether it sends 200,000 or 300,000 more, U.S. imperialism will never escape its already doomed fate of failure.

### 南越《解放军报》评侵越美军一年来的惨重败绩  美国的钢铁敌不过南越军民的战斗精神  侵略者不论增兵多少也逃不了失败命运

    南越《解放军报》评侵越美军一年来的惨重败绩
    美国的钢铁敌不过南越军民的战斗精神
    侵略者不论增兵多少也逃不了失败命运
    新华社河内九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量机关报《解放军报》最近发表评论指出，美国侵略者把大批军队派到越南南方，一年来，不仅不能挽救他们所处的被动窘境，反而遭到更加惨重的失败。一九六六年将是美国侵略者的处境陷于更加悲惨的一年。
    评论指出，经过一年来的较量，美国侵略军已经赤裸裸地暴露出它的无法克服的弱点。美国的钢铁是绝对对付不了英雄的民族和军队的坚强不屈的战斗精神的。
    评论说，去年，美国把它的海军陆战队、空运伞兵、步兵以及所谓的“空中骑兵”等各种“精锐”部队派到越南南方作战。但是，这些侵略军，不论是驻扎在那个坚固的据点里，深藏在那个城市中，或者在飞机、大炮的掩护下躲在装甲车里进行活动，都逃脱不了被消灭的命运。他们从整班、整排地被歼灭，到整连、整营甚至整个战团地被歼灭掉。
    评论说，去年，美国海军陆战队刚刚踏上越南南方的土地，脚根还没有站稳，广南省军民在青山战斗中就给了他们当头一棒。在文相战斗中，他们又被打得伤亡惨重，遗尸遍野。美国第一○一空降师和第一七三空降旅在顺宁、边葛、D战区等地，第一步兵师在保邦、甘车等地被解放军打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。曾经被美国大肆吹嘘为“王牌军”的第一骑兵师，在波来梅地区也遭到了解放军的沉重打击。
    评论说，事实已经表明，不论是美国的那一种兵种、军种，也不论它怎样“精锐”、“机动”、“善战”，也都逃脱不了越南南方军民的严厉惩罚。派进越南南方的美国侵略军越多，被歼灭的也就越多。
    评论说，美国侵略者还曾经把希望寄托在旱季。在旱季到来的初期，美国曾把第一骑兵师和第一步兵师集中在波来梅和D战区—边葛两个“重点”地区，妄图进行“反攻”。然而，正是在这两个地区，美国侵略军又遭到了最沉重的失败。在波来梅，仅从去年十一月一日到十八日期间，越南南方解放军就一举歼灭了第一骑兵师第三旅的一个营、两个连和七个排共一千七百多人。在D战区—边葛、油汀等地，仅去年十一月初到十二月初，被歼的美伪军也达七千多名。
    评论说，继雨季的各次大捷以后，越南南方各解放武装力量在旱季一开始就给美国侵略军以沉重的打击，他们打得猛，打得准，打得狠，这里打，那里也打，接连不断地打。美国侵略军在旱季初期的失败，是它的“旱季反攻”计划必将完全破产的征兆。
    评论最后说，美帝国主义正在打算继续增派军队到越南南方，但是，不论增派二十万还是三十万，美帝国主义也决逃脱不了它已经注定的失败命运。
