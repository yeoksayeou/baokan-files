    Hanoi, February 10 (Xinhua) The Vietnamese "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" published editorials and commentaries respectively on February 10, emphasizing that the U.S. imperialists' new conspiracy, hatched at the Honolulu Conference, to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam cannot reverse their defeat in South Vietnam.
      The "People's Daily" editorial said that Johnson and his gang of demons and monsters were staging a "meeting" farce with the Vietnamese traitors and running dogs Nguyễn Văn Thiệu and Nguyễn Cao Kỳ on a small island in the Pacific. Johnson and his running dogs signed the so-called "Honolulu Declaration" and "Communique," which are filled with the stench of colonialism and national betrayal.
    It said that at the several so-called "National Security Council" meetings held continuously by the Johnson clique in Washington at the end of January this year, decisions had already been made on all matters pertaining to strengthening and expanding the war of aggression. In Honolulu, only the relevant specific military plans to implement the above-mentioned decisions were discussed separately at a military conference between Johnson, McNamara, and U.S. generals such as Wheeler and Westmoreland. The Vietnamese traitor clique was never allowed by its American master to participate in the discussion, nor did it know what they were discussing. The talks between Johnson and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu—Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, as well as the so-called "Honolulu Declaration" and "Joint Communique," are merely a political trick by the United States to put makeup on its Saigon running dogs, to stabilize the Saigon running dog clique, which is fiercely vying for power and fearing being kicked away by its master halfway, and also to cope with the contradictions within the U.S. ruling clique.
    The editorial pointed out that although the Honolulu Conference was a kind of trick, it still exposed the ambition of U.S. imperialism. The Johnson clique is playing a "two-faced tactic," that is, on the one hand, frantically strengthening various military activities; on the other hand, stepping up the implementation of their deceptive so-called "Rural Pacification Program," "Social Reform," and so on.
    The editorial pointed out that the essence of the "Rural Pacification Program" discussed by the Johnson gang is still a plan to attempt to conquer the Vietnamese people by force, and the main means adopted are frantic "sweeps." The American aggressors and their running dogs vainly attempt to eliminate the revolutionary forces of the Vietnamese people through this method, re-establish the already and about to disintegrate rural reactionary regime, drive the people into concentration camps, invade the liberated areas of South Vietnam, and expand their control areas. Their so-called establishment of an elected "government" and "health, education programs," "opposition to poverty, backwardness, and disease," are merely tricks played by the American aggressors to deceive the people. This is a new plan for them to rebuild the "strategic hamlets" that have been destroyed. The editorial said that the plans discussed and announced by the Johnson clique in Honolulu more specifically exposed the sinister conspiracy of their so-called "peace seeking" offensive. Obviously, they have no sincerity whatsoever in seeking a peaceful solution to the Vietnam issue.
    The editorial said that for independence and freedom, and for their basic national rights, the Vietnamese people are determined to concentrate all their efforts to defeat the American aggressors. The army and people of South Vietnam must continue to fight, eliminate more and more American troops and puppet troops, and smash their military operations and "sweeps," while smashing their so-called "Rural Pacification Program" and all other deceptive means. The army and people of North Vietnam are determined to defeat the U.S. imperialists' destructive war and wholeheartedly support the revolution in South Vietnam. Our national people must promote the anti-American resistance to save the nation until complete victory.
    The commentary published by the "People's Army Daily" said that although the Johnson clique used cunning and black-and-white reversed words at the Honolulu Conference, it still exposed the U.S. position of aggression and expanding the war. Although the United States is doing its best to conceal it, the Honolulu Conference is essentially still a war conference. The commentary pointed out that Westmoreland's so-called "five-point strategy" is actually just an old strategy full of contradictions and repeated failures. The more the United States implements this strategy, the more it disperses its forces, the more it introduces the American army into a dead end, and the more it is submerged by the people's war in Vietnam. In short, the U.S. strategy cannot escape its predicament, but the more it struggles, the worse it gets, and the more it struggles, the closer it gets to death.
    The commentary said that in the past eleven years, the Vietnamese people have successively defeated a series of U.S. strategies and frustrated all its conspiracies in the military, political, and economic fields. Relying on these rich experiences, the Vietnamese people are determined to fight to the end and will surely completely crush all the unspeakable conspiracies of the United States and frustrate its aggressive ambitions.

### 越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》发表评论  檀香山会议是个战争会议  美帝策划扩大侵越战争新阴谋扭转不了它在南越的败局

    越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》发表评论
    檀香山会议是个战争会议
    美帝策划扩大侵越战争新阴谋扭转不了它在南越的败局
    新华社河内十日电　越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》十日分别发表社论和评论强调指出，美帝国主义在檀香山会议上策划的加强和扩大侵越战争的新阴谋，扭转不了它在南越的败局。
      《人民报》的社论说，约翰逊及其一伙牛鬼蛇神同阮文绍—阮高其越奸走狗在太平洋的一个小岛上玩弄“会谈”把戏。约翰逊及其走狗签订了充满殖民主义和卖国臭气的所谓“檀香山宣言”和“公报”。
    它说，约翰逊集团于今年一月底在华盛顿连续召开的几次所谓“国家安全会议”上，已经对所有属于加强和扩大侵略战争的问题作出了决定。在檀香山，也只是在约翰逊、麦克纳马拉以及惠勒、威斯特摩兰等美国将领之间的一次军事会议上单独讨论为实现上述决定的有关军事具体计划，而越奸集团从没有得到美国主子允许参与讨论，同时也不知道它们讨论些什么。约翰逊和阮文绍—阮高其之间的会谈，以及所谓“檀香山宣言”、“联合公报”等，只不过是美国为它的西贡走狗涂脂抹粉的一种政治手段，是为了安定正在激烈地争权夺利并害怕中途被主子一脚踢开的西贡走狗集团，同时也是为了应付美国统治集团内部发生的矛盾。
    社论指出，檀香山会议虽然是一种把戏，但是仍然暴露了美帝国主义的野心。约翰逊集团正在玩弄着“两面手法”，这就是一方面疯狂地加强各种军事活动；另一方面，加紧实现它们诡诈的所谓“绥靖农村计划”，“社会改革”等等。
    社论指出，约翰逊之流讨论的“绥靖农村计划”的实质仍然是企图以武力征服越南人民的计划，而采取的主要手段是疯狂“扫荡”。美国侵略者及其走狗妄图通过这种办法消灭越南人民的革命力量，把已经和正在瓦解的农村反动政权重新扶植起来，把人民赶到集中营里，侵占越南南方的解放区，扩大它们的控制地区。它们所谓的建立一个选举产生的“政府”、和“卫生、教育计划”、“反对贫困、落后和疾病”等，只不过是美国侵略者为了欺骗人民而玩弄的手段而已。这是它们为重建已经被捣毁了的“战略村”的一种新计划。社论说，约翰逊集团在檀香山所谓讨论和公布的计划更具体地暴露了它们所谓“谋求和平”攻势的毒辣阴谋。显然，它们是丝毫也没有要求和平解决越南问题的诚意的。
    社论说，越南全国人民为了独立和自由，为了自己的基本民族权利，决心集中全力击败美国侵略者。越南南方军民一定继续战斗，消灭越来越多的美军和伪军，粉碎它们的军事行动和“扫荡”，同时粉碎它们的所谓“绥靖农村计划”以及其他一切骗人的手段。越南北方军民坚决击败美帝国主义的破坏性战争，全心全力支援越南南方的革命。我国全国人民一定要促进抗美救国的抗战事业，直到完全胜利。
    《人民军队报》发表的评论说，约翰逊集团在檀香山会议上尽管使用了奸猾、颠倒黑白的词句，但是仍然暴露了美国的侵略和扩大战争的立场。虽然美国竭力进行掩饰，但是，檀香山会议实质上仍然是一个战争会议。评论指出，威斯特摩兰的所谓“五点战略”，实际上只不过是一个充满矛盾和接连失败的旧战略而已。美国越是实现这一战略，就越分散力量，就越把美军引进死胡同，越来越被越南的人民战争所淹没。总之，美国的战略无法逃脱困境，而是越挣扎越糟、越挣扎越临近死亡。
    评论说，过去十一年，越南人民已经接连击败了美国的一系列战略，挫败了它在军事、政治和经济方面的一切阴谋。越南人民依靠这些丰富的经验，坚决战斗到底，一定能够完全粉碎美国的一切见不了人的阴谋，挫败它的侵略野心。
