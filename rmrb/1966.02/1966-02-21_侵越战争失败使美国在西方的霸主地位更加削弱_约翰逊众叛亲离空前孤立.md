　　The failure of the Vietnam War further weakens the US hegemonic position in the West.
　　Johnson is Isolated and Increasingly Alone.
    The US government, which is being consumed by its own fire in Vietnam, finds itself increasingly isolated and abandoned by its allies.
    In order to gain some support from its allies, the Johnson administration frequently dispatches key officials to travel and lobby; US President Johnson and Secretary of State Rusk also personally make efforts to coerce and entice allies. However, so far, most of the US allies hold indifferent and resistant attitudes. Only a few support the United States. Even among the latter, each has its own plans, fearing being dragged down and becoming America's "scapegoat."
    US resumption of bombing and expansion of the Vietnam War causes unease and dissatisfaction among some Western allies
    Recently, after the failure of the highly publicized "peace offensive," the United States resumed bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The French government, whose global strategy is in opposition to that of the United States, quickly issued a statement bluntly warning the United States: "The French government can only regret and express its disagreement with the resumption of bombing." It also opposed the US using the United Nations to promote the "peace talks" fraud, emphasizing that the United Nations is "not qualified to interfere" in the Vietnam issue. The French governing party, the Union for the New Republic's newspaper *La Nation* saw through Johnson's confusion during the Honolulu conference, where the strengthening of the Vietnam War was planned. It mocked Washington for being caught in a "veritable maze" in Vietnam and having "lost the roadmap that would allow them to find the exit of this maze."
    Other Western allies of the United States, such as some Nordic countries and Canada, also expressed "unease" or "disappointment" with the US resumption of bombing and expansion of the war. According to Western newspapers, other allied governments have adopted a "polite reservation" regarding the US actions. Western journalists pointed out that this situation reflects "a crisis of confidence in Washington within the Western bloc," and that "even America's most 'unconditionally loyal' allies are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with it in the alternating use of force and advocacy of peace."
    Two major aggressive blocs are unwilling to serve the US, fearing being dragged into the South Vietnamese quagmire with the United States
    The Johnson administration is very eager to obtain the active support of its main allies in the Western world—the members of the North Atlantic Group—and especially wants them to accept the US policy of shifting its strategic focus from Europe to Asia. The US plan is: on the one hand, to hope that these allies will help rescue it from its isolated and helpless situation in Vietnam, asking them to contribute to supporting the US in expanding the war, and even antagonizing China. If this is not possible, then at least to have these allies be understanding of the United States, asking them to exert more effort in the "defense" of Western Europe; on the other hand, at a time when the US and the Soviet Union are tacitly engaged in "détente" in Europe, to "inject new vitality" into this aggressive military bloc, which has lost its basis for existence and is on the verge of disintegration.
    US Secretary of State Rusk recently coerced Western European allies to support the US in a televised speech broadcast to Europe. He wanted Western European allies "not to underestimate" the problem faced by the US "in fighting in the Pacific while maintaining all its obligations in Western Europe." He emphasized: "We hope to get as much help as possible on these issues, and we hope that every member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization…will shoulder as much of the burden of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as possible."
    The US intentions were already very blatant at the meeting of the Ministerial Council of the North Atlantic Group held earlier in the year. Contrary to usual practice, it turned the spearhead towards China at the meeting discussing the group's "defense" issues, attempting to raise the banner of "containing China" to drive the US's Western European allies to Asia, and primarily to Vietnam, to serve the US. However, the response of other members of the North Atlantic Group was very lukewarm. US representative to the North Atlantic Group Cleveland uneasily said: "The United States feels a bit lonely in those regions (Southeast Asia). The United States is increasingly puzzled as to why a Europe that is now very strong and prosperous is not participating in an important, fiercely fought front in our global confrontation with the communists."
    The allies are also not enthusiastic about the US demand that other members of the North Atlantic Group make greater contributions to "European defense." Some are shouting that the current "defense" burden is already too heavy, and some are even taking the opportunity to demand that the US give it a status and rights "commensurate with its contribution to Western defense."
    As for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which the US put together specifically to suppress national liberation movements and revolutionary struggles in the Southeast Asian region, it is also completely paralyzed and does not listen to US commands. At the military advisory meeting and the meeting of the Ministerial Council of this group held successively in April and May of last year, the US tried its best to promote "joint action" to invade Vietnam, and asked its allies to provide "military assistance" to South Vietnam. However, both of these meetings were a mess. France refused to attend the meeting of the Ministerial Council, Pakistan clearly stated its opposition to "large-scale support for US actions in Vietnam in the name of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization," and some other Asian member states were unwilling to undertake specific obligations. Apart from the South Korean puppet regime, which provides cannon fodder for the US war of aggression, only Australia and New Zealand, which have sent "symbolic troops," remain to this day.
    Why are these aggressive military blocs, painstakingly pieced together by the US after the war, unwilling to help when the US is getting battered and bruised in Vietnam? There are common reasons, as well as the individual considerations of these allies. The common reason is that the dirty war being waged by the US has aroused strong opposition from people of all countries, and an unprecedented aid-Vietnam and resist-America movement is booming around the world. The US allies are all worried that running with the US in the face of this situation will burn them. These allies are also increasingly seeing that the US defeat in Vietnam is irreversible. If they rashly get involved, they will eventually perish along with the US.
    France plays a counter-role, West Germany is also unreliable, and although Britain is willing to serve, it also has reservations.
    Among the US allies, France's performance is the most prominent, as it resolutely opposes the US policy in Vietnam. This is because there are sharp conflicts of interest between France and the US in the Southeast Asian region. Eleven years ago, French troops were forced to withdraw from Indochina, and the US immediately moved in, trying its best to squeeze out the influence left by France, causing great dissatisfaction in France. At present, France's opposition to the US policy in Southeast Asia has become one of the main contents of the comprehensive confrontation between the US and France on a series of global issues. It is in this context that French President de Gaulle has repeatedly expressed his "extreme disapproval" of the US expanding the Vietnam War, demanding the withdrawal of US troops, advocating the "neutralization of Southeast Asia," and taking a series of actions to paralyze the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
    West Germany, the main ally that the US relies on in Western Europe, is not so reliable. In order to have the US support its militaristic and imperialist ambitions, it has repeatedly publicly declared its support for the US aggression against Vietnam as an exchange, and has provided economic and medical "aid" to the Saigon puppet regime. However, West Germany is mainly concerned not with the Vietnam issue, but with some issues directly related to its ambitions, such as dabbling in nuclear weapons, acquiring "great power status," annexing East Germany, and vying for hegemony in Western Europe. West Germany is deeply suspicious of the US shifting its strategic focus eastward, engaging in "peaceful coexistence" with the Soviet Union on the Western Front, and withdrawing troops from Western Europe to Vietnam. It is precisely for this reason that the Bonn government has publicly announced that West Germany is uneasy about the expansion of the Vietnam War. West Germany is also unwilling to provide military aid for the US aggression against Vietnam, because this means getting burned without getting the mutton, which is not conducive to its expansion of influence to Asian, African, and Latin American countries. West German government spokesman von Hase stated West Germany's position on February 14, saying that Bonn gives Washington political support, but "any military aid is out of the question."
    Britain is willing to serve the US on the Vietnam issue, supporting every aggressive step taken by the US, and running around for the US "peace talks" fraud, hoping to exchange this for economic, military, and political help from the US to maintain its shaky "great power status." However, British Prime Minister Wilson stated that the Labor government also has "some reservations" about the US policy in Vietnam. According to multiple disclosures by Wilson and Foreign Secretary Stewart, this is mainly due to concerns that Britain's remaining colonial positions in Southeast Asia would be swept away after the war expands. Therefore, it emphasizes financial difficulties and insufficient troops, stating that Britain cannot make military "contributions" in Vietnam. Wilson revealed at the Labor Party's annual conference last year that the US had pressured Britain to send troops to South Vietnam as a condition for helping to save the pound crisis, but the British government "refused and made no attempt to link this issue to economic cooperation."
    The US hegemonic position has plummeted. Despite its best efforts, it is difficult to drag others into the water.
    The Johnson government's isolated situation shows that the US hegemonic position has plummeted. Fifteen years ago, when the US launched the Korean War, it was still able to piece together a "United Nations force" with troops from fifteen countries to work for the US. But today, despite its best efforts, it is unable to "internationalize" the Vietnam War. It is no wonder that US Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Russell sighed blankly that the US today is in an "even more unfavorable position in Vietnam than we were during the Korean War."
    An article published in *U.S. News & World Report* magazine not long ago reflected the US ruling group's distress and helplessness over this situation. It said with a mournful tone: "The United States has defense treaty ties with forty-two countries, but it finds that these partners provide very little help in today's world… Now, the illusions that the United States has about its alliances and many allies are gradually disappearing."　　(Xinhua News Agency) (Attached picture)

### 侵越战争失败使美国在西方的霸主地位更加削弱　约翰逊众叛亲离空前孤立

　　侵越战争失败使美国在西方的霸主地位更加削弱
　　约翰逊众叛亲离空前孤立
    在越南玩火自焚的美国政府，在它的盟国中也落得众叛亲离，空前孤立。
    约翰逊政府为了从盟国那里得到一些支持，经常派出一些要员四出奔走，进行游说；美国总统约翰逊和国务卿腊斯克也亲自出马，对盟国威逼利诱。但是，直到目前，在美国的盟国中大多数持冷淡和抗拒的态度。支持美国的寥寥无几。即使在后一类国家中，也是各有打算，害怕被拖下水，害怕当美国的“殉葬品”。
    美国恢复轰炸扩大侵越战争使一些西方盟国不安和不满
    最近，美国在大吹大擂的“和平攻势”失败后恢复轰炸越南民主共和国，这时以自己的全球战略同美国的全球战略相对峙的法国政府很快就发表声明，直率地警告美国：“法国政府对于恢复轰炸的做法只能感到遗憾和表示不同意。”它还反对美国利用联合国去推行“和谈”骗局，强调指出联合国“没有资格干涉”越南问题。美国召开檀香山会议策划强化越南战争，法国执政党新共和联盟的机关报《民族报》在这里看穿了约翰逊乱了章法。它嘲笑华盛顿在越南陷入“名副其实的迷魂阵”之中，并且已经“失掉了使他们能够找到这个迷魂阵出口的那张路线图”。
    美国的其他西方盟国，例如一些北欧国家和加拿大，也对美国恢复轰炸和扩大战争表示“不安”或“失望”。据西方报刊报道，另外还有一些盟国的政府不满美国的做法而采取“有礼貌的保留态度”。西方报界人士指出，这种状况反映了“西方集团对华盛顿的信任危机”，“连美国最‘不讲价钱的’盟友，在（美国）使用武力和主张和平两手交替进行的情况下，也越来越难于跟着它跑了”。
    两大侵略集团不愿为美效劳怕同美国一起掉进南越泥沼
    约翰逊政府十分希望得到它在西方世界中的主要盟国——北大西洋集团成员国的积极支持，特别想使它们接受美国把战略重点从欧洲转向亚洲的方针。美国的打算是：一方面希望这些盟国帮忙解救它在越南孤立无助的处境，要它们出力支援美国扩大战争，甚至同中国为敌，如果作不到这点，则退而求其次，要这些盟国体谅美国，要它们对西欧“防务”出更多的力量；另一方面，在美苏默契在欧洲搞“缓和”的时刻，给失去存在根据而濒于解体的这个侵略性军事集团“注入新的生命力”。
    美国国务卿腊斯克最近在向欧洲转播的一篇电视谈话中胁迫西欧盟国支持美国。他要西欧盟国“不要低估”美国“在太平洋那边打仗而同时要维持在西欧的全部义务所面临的问题”。他强调：“我们希望在这些问题上得到尽可能多的帮助，我们也希望北大西洋公约组织中每个成员……尽可能多地挑起北大西洋公约组织的担子。”
    美国的意图，早在年前举行的北大西洋集团部长理事会会议上已经表现得十分露骨。它一反惯例，在讨论这个集团“防务”问题的会议上把矛头转向中国，妄图打起“遏制中国”的旗号来驱使美国的西欧盟国到亚洲，首先是到越南，为美国效劳。但是北大西洋集团其他成员国的反映十分冷淡。美国驻北大西洋集团的代表克利夫兰不安地说：“美国在那些地区（东南亚）感到有点孤单。美国感到越来越不解的是，如今很强大和繁荣的欧洲怎么没有参加我们同共产党人在全球大对峙中的一条重要的、斗争激烈的战线。”
    对于美国要北大西洋集团其他成员国为“欧洲防务”作出更大贡献，盟国也不热心。它们有的大喊目前的“防务”负担已经过重，有的甚至反而乘机要美国给它以“同它对西方防务的贡献相称”的地位和权利。
    至于美国专门为了在东南亚地区镇压民族解放运动和革命斗争而拼凑起来的东南亚条约集团，也完全瘫痪，不听从美国的使唤。在去年四、五月间相继举行的这个集团的军事顾问会议和部长理事会会议上，美国竭力鼓吹侵略越南的“联合行动”，要盟国对南越提供“军事援助”。但是，这两次会议都开得七零八落。法国拒绝出席部长理事会会议，巴基斯坦明确表示反对“以东南亚条约组织名义大规模支持美国在越南的行动”，其他一些亚洲成员国也不肯承担具体义务。为美国侵略战争提供炮灰的，除南朝鲜傀儡政权外，到现在仍然只有派出“象征性部队”的澳大利亚和新西兰。
    美国在战后苦心拼凑的这些侵略性军事集团，当美国在越南碰得头破血流的时候，为什么不肯出来帮忙呢？这里有共同的原因，也有这些盟国各自的考虑。共同的原因是：美国进行的这场肮脏战争，已经激起各国人民的强烈反对，一个空前规模的援越抗美运动正在世界各地蓬勃发展，美国的盟国都担心，在这种形势面前跟着美国跑，必将引火烧身。这些盟国还越来越看到，美国在越南的败局已经无法挽回，如果贸然卷进去，最后就要同美国一起灭顶。
    法国唱对台戏西德也靠不住英国虽甘心效劳但也有保留
    在美国的盟国中，法国的表现最突出，它断然反对美国在越南的政策。这是因为法美两国在东南亚地区有尖锐的利害冲突。十一年前，法国军队被迫退出印度支那，美国就立即钻进去，竭力排挤法国留下的影响，引起法国的极大不满。目前，法国反对美国在东南亚的政策已经成为美法在一系列世界性问题上全面对抗的主要内容之一。正是在这种情况下，法国总统戴高乐不止一次地表示“极不赞成”美国扩大越南战争，要求美国军队撤退，鼓吹“东南亚中立化”，并且采取一系列行动来瘫痪东南亚条约集团。
    美国在西欧所依靠的主要盟国西德不是那么十分可靠，由于要美国支持它的军国主义和帝国主义野心，作为交换，曾经一再公开宣布支持美国侵略越南，并且给西贡傀儡政权提供经济和医疗“援助”。但是，西德主要关心的并不是越南问题，而是同它的野心直接相关的一些问题，如染指核武器、取得“大国地位”、吞并民主德国、争霸西欧等等。对于美国战略重点东移，同苏联在西线搞“和平共处”而从西欧抽调驻军去越南，西德疑惧很深。正是由于这种缘故，波恩政府曾经公开宣布，西德对越南战争的扩大感到不安。西德也不愿意为美国侵略越南提供军事援助，因为这意味着吃不着羊肉反惹一身膻，不利于它向亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家扩张势力。西德政府发言人冯·哈塞二月十四日这样申明西德的立场，他说，波恩给华盛顿以政治上的支持，但是“一切军事援助是谈不上的”。
    英国在越南问题上甘愿为美国效劳，支持美国采取的每一个侵略步骤，为美国的“和谈”骗局到处奔跑，指望以此换取美国在经济、军事和政治上的帮助，来维持摇摇欲坠的“大国地位”。然而，英国首相威尔逊表示，工党政府对美国在越南的政策也“有一些保留”。据威尔逊和外交大臣斯图尔特多次透露，这主要是由于担心战争扩大后英国在东南亚地区残存的殖民阵地会被冲垮。因此，它强调财政困难和兵力不足，表示英国不能在越南作出军事上的“贡献”。威尔逊去年在工党年会上透露，美国曾经以帮助挽救英镑危机为条件压迫英国出兵南越，但是英国政府“拒绝了，而且没有任何企图要把这个问题同经济合作联系起来”。
    美国的霸主地位已一落千丈尽管费尽心机也难拖人下水
    约翰逊政府这种孤立处境表明，美国的霸主地位已经一落千丈。十五年前美国发动侵朝战争时，毕竟还能够拼凑一支有十五个国家的军队参加的“联合国部队”，来为美国卖命。而今天，尽管费尽了心机，却无法使侵越战争“国际化”。难怪美国参议院军事委员会主席拉塞尔茫然若失地叹道，美国今天在越南“甚至处于比我们在朝鲜战争时更为不利的地位”。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》周刊不久前发表的一篇文章反映了美国统治集团对这种局面苦恼不堪，但又束手无策。它满怀凄凉的情调说：“美国同四十二个国家有防务条约的联系，但它发现，这些伙伴们在今天的世界里所提供的帮助却少得可怜……现在，美国对它的这些联盟和很多盟国所抱的幻想，正日趋消失。”　　（新华社）（附图片）
