    Testimony Revealing Wild Ambitions
    A commentary by a Xinhua News Agency reporter
    U.S. Secretary of State Rusk’s testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 18th once again demonstrated to the world that U.S. imperialism is determined to forcibly occupy South Vietnam and will never lay down its butcher knife.
    The so-called "five core points" of the U.S. policy toward South Vietnam, put forward by Rusk in his testimony, are completely a set of bandit logic. The core of these "five core points" is that U.S. imperialism must maintain its rule over South Vietnam. In order to achieve this, Rusk stated that the degree of U.S. "military involvement in Vietnam" should not be restricted, and he advocated that "toughness" is "absolutely necessary." Rusk said, "We are only asking them to give up taking over South Vietnam by force." Rusk also shamelessly stated: Everything is negotiable except for the U.S. giving up South Vietnam. Rusk said it so simply and clearly: The U.S. wants nothing but for the South Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and surrender to the U.S. aggressors. The U.S. wants nothing but for the Vietnamese people to gladly agree that the U.S. masters have the right to rule South Vietnam. Look, the U.S. bandits have stated so simply and clearly what they want and what they don't want! Is there any need for people to doubt it any further?
    Rusk also played the "brinkmanship" policy, using "outbreak of a major war" to blackmail the Vietnamese and Chinese people. However, the facts have proven, and will continue to prove in the future, that Rusk's "brinkmanship" cannot scare the Vietnamese people or the Chinese people, but will only scare some people in the U.S. ruling clique. The old ancestor of "brinkmanship," Cold War expert Dulles, is already in his grave, and his advocacy of this method has long been shamefully bankrupt. Now, in a situation where the Asian people and the people of the world are more awake and their strength is greater, Rusk's attempt to re-invoke this blackmailing tactic only demonstrates the decline and desperation of U.S. imperialism.
    The U.S. has experienced the firm stance of the Vietnamese people. Neither the U.S.'s two-pronged approach of war and "peace" can conquer the heroic and unyielding Vietnamese people. The U.S.'s "ground war" has already been met with bloody noses, the U.S.'s sea and air "superiority" has been met with head-on blows, and the U.S.'s "escalation of the war" can only be "escalation of failure," which is already doomed. As for the Chinese people, we have repeatedly declared that no matter how much it costs, we will fully support the Vietnamese people's struggle until the U.S. aggressors are completely defeated and final victory is achieved. The Chinese people have long been prepared, and if U.S. imperialism insists on expanding the war to China, the Chinese people will only resolutely fight back and accompany them to the end. What Rusk needs to worry about is that while he is intimidating China, the U.S. ruling clique has already erupted in unprecedented quarrels, and many of them are revealing fearful and uneasy emotions. They believe that U.S. "provocation of China is dangerous," and that U.S. fighting China would be "a major disaster" for the U.S.
    Rusk lacked confidence in his intimidation and blackmailing tactics, so he pinned his hopes on: Under the pressure of the U.S., China might "turn to peaceful competition" like the Soviet revisionists and give up supporting the anti-U.S. revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries. However, fantasies are ultimately fantasies, and they only expose the helpless and embarrassing appearance of U.S. policymakers in the face of the Chinese giant who is holding high the banner of revolution. Rusk also spoke with a "self-comforting" mood about the treacherous position of the Khrushchev revisionists in uniting with the U.S. against China, saying, "It is not only the West that is uneasy about Red China's expansionism." "A very famous representative of the communist world" once told him that the number one problem today is to make Beijing turn to peaceful coexistence with the West. Unfortunately, Rusk's vision is too short-sighted. Although the Khrushchev revisionists are conspiring with the U.S., India, and Japan to build a "wall to contain China" around China, the Asian people and the people of the world want revolution, and China's great influence cannot be "contained" by any force. The treacherous acts of the Khrushchev revisionists, apart from isolating themselves from the people of all countries, will not end well and will absolutely not help U.S. imperialism.
    Rusk's testimony once again best exposed what kind of stuff the U.S.'s "peace talks" fraud really is. Although Rusk shamelessly talked about "peace," saying that the U.S. would "not ignore any possibility of seeking peace," and although the U.S. is still continuing to plot "peace" frauds through various channels, Rusk's repeated emphasis throughout his speech on the U.S.'s "determination" to stay in South Vietnam more powerfully demonstrates than any "peace" words or "peace" actions that whether it is peddling "peace" or advocating war, the U.S.'s only purpose is to insist on occupying South Vietnam.
    An article by a soldier published in the Vietnamese People's Daily on the 18th clearly pointed out that there is only one way to restore peace in Vietnam: The U.S. devils get out of South Vietnam. The article also emphasized that the issue of war and peace in Vietnam is as clear as day: The U.S. bandits are the aggressors, Vietnam is the victim of aggression, and they must fight to the end for self-defense. It is strange that some "well-intentioned people" do not distinguish between right and wrong between the aggressor and the victim, saying that both sides should "compromise" and "negotiate." Rusk's speech on the 18th forcefully proved from the opposite side that the U.S.'s "peace" nonsense is not worth a penny. All those who express sympathy and support for the Vietnamese people's liberation struggle should not be fooled by the Americans.

    野心毕露的证词
    新华社记者述评
    美国国务卿腊斯克十八日在美国参议院外交委员会的作证，再一次向全世界表明，美帝国主义决心要以武力霸占越南南方，决不会放下它的屠刀。
    腊斯克在证词里提出的所谓美国对南越政策的“五点核心”，完全是一套强盗逻辑。这“五点核心”中的核心是，美帝国主义一定要保持它对南越的统治。为了实现这一点，腊斯克表示，美国“在军事上卷入越南的程度”不应受什么限制，他鼓吹“强硬”是“绝对必要的”。腊斯克说，“我们只是要求他们放弃以武力接管南越”，腊斯克还恬不知耻地表示：除了要美国放弃南越以外，其他一切都好说。腊斯克说得多么简单明白：美国什么都不要，就只要南越人民放下武器，向美国侵略者屈膝投降。美国什么都不要，就只要越南人民欣然同意美国老爷有统治越南南方的权利。请看，美国强盗要什么，不要什么，真是说得如此简单明白！难道还用得着人们再怀疑么？
    腊斯克还玩弄“边缘”政策，以“爆发大战”来对越南人民和中国人民进行讹诈。但是，事实已经证明，今后还要继续证明，腊斯克的“边缘”手法吓不倒越南人民、中国人民，却只会吓倒美国统治集团一些人。“边缘政策”的老祖师、冷战专家杜勒斯已经进了坟墓，他鼓吹这种手法也早已可耻地破了产。现在，在亚洲人民和全世界人民更加觉醒、力量更加壮大的形势下，腊斯克企图重新乞灵于这种讹诈的手法，只是表明了美帝国主义的日暮途穷而已。
    越南人民的坚定立场，美国是领教过了的，美国的战与“和”的两手都征服不了英勇不屈的越南人民。美国的“地面战争”已经碰得头破血流，美国的海空“优势”已经遭到迎头痛击，美国的“战争升级”只能是
  “失败升级”，这是早已注定了的。至于中国人民，我们已经一再宣告，不管要付出多大代价，都将全力支持越南人民的斗争直到彻底打败美国侵略者、取得最后胜利。中国人民早已做好准备，如果美帝国主义一定要把战争扩大到中国，中国人民只有坚决应战，奉陪到底。腊斯克需要关心的倒是：当他向中国进行恫吓的时候，美国统治集团已经爆发空前的争吵，其中许多人流露出恐惧不安的情绪。他们认为，美国“向中国挑衅是危险的”，美国同中国作战对美国将是“一场大灾难”。
    腊斯克对他的恫吓讹诈手法是信心不足的，因而他又把希望寄托在：中国在美国的压力下也许会象苏联修正主义者一样“转向和平竞赛”而放弃支持各国人民的反美革命斗争。但是，幻想终究是幻想，它徒然暴露了美国决策者们在高举革命大旗的中国巨人面前无可奈何的狼狈相。腊斯克还怀着“聊以自慰”的心情谈到赫鲁晓夫修正主义者联美反华的背叛立场，他说，“对赤色中国的扩张主义感到不安的不仅仅是西方”，“共产党世界的一个非常著名的代表”曾经对他说过，今天的头号问题是使北京转而同西方和平共处。可惜，腊斯克目光过于短浅了，尽管赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在同美国、印度、日本一起合谋在中国周围砌起一道“遏制中国的墙”，但是亚洲人民、全世界人民是要革命的，中国的伟大影响是任何力量也“遏制”不了的。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的叛卖勾当除了使他们自绝于各国人民以外，决不会有什么好下场，也绝对帮不了美帝国主义的忙。
    腊斯克的证词，又一次最好地戳穿了美国的“和谈”骗局究竟是什么样的货色。尽管腊斯克厚着脸皮谈论“和平”，说什么美国将“不忽略任何一个谋求和平的可能性”，尽管美国目前还在通过各种途径继续策划“和平”骗局，但是，腊斯克在通篇演说中反复强调的美国要赖在南越不走的“决心”，却比任何“和平”言词、“和平”行动都更有力地表明，无论是叫卖“和平”，还是鼓吹战争，美国的目的只有一个，那就是坚持霸占南越。
    越南《人民报》十八日发表的一篇战士的文章明确指出，恢复越南和平的办法只有一个，那就是：美国佬滚出越南南方。这篇文章还强调指出：越南的战争与和平问题，是和白昼一样清楚的事：美国强盗是侵略者，越南是被侵略者，必须为了自卫而战斗到底。世界上有些“好心人”对侵略者和被侵略者不分是非，说是双方都应该“让步”和“谈判”，这是奇怪的。腊斯克十八日的谈话恰好从反面有力地证明了：美国的“和平”鬼话不值一文钱。一切表示同情和支持越南人民解放斗争的人们，都不应当上美国人的当。
