    Cadre and Workers, Hearts Linked
    Driller Zhao Wenliang

    In the past and now, every cadre in our team has made it a habit and formed a style of checking blankets and bedding at night.

    One night, except for Captain Wang Tianqi, who had a high fever, all the other cadres were away from home. Should the blanket-checking work be temporarily suspended tonight? No! Captain Wang, disregarding his illness, dragged his heavy, dizzy body to each shift to check the stoves, test the room temperature, and see if everyone had their blankets tucked in properly. After he had checked the blankets of all forty-odd people in the team, he dragged his tired body back to sleep.

    Not long after Captain Wang fell asleep, he saw driller Lu Xingshan walk up to his bed, holding a paper package in his hand. Lu Xingshan said excitedly: "Captain, I saw everything tonight. I saw your face covered in sweat, and when you tucked my blanket in, I could feel your hand burning. If I hadn't been afraid of disturbing everyone, I would have carried you back to the dormitory. I have nothing else to express my feelings with. This half-jin of sugar is the health sugar I saved, please accept it!" Lu Xingshan's words also moved Captain Wang. He said: "Xiao Lu, tucking in blankets is my duty. I usually check twice every night, and only checking once today is not enough."

    The next day, Lu Xingshan told everyone about this, and the comrades were deeply moved. From then on, everyone's enthusiasm became even greater.

    干部工人心连心
    司钻　赵文良
    过去和现在，我们队上每个干部已把晚上查铺盖被的工作养成了习惯，形成了作风。
    有一天晚上，除有病发高烧的队长王天其在家之外，其他干部都不在家。是不是今晚的查铺工作暂时停止一下呢？不！王队长不顾自己正病着，拖着头重脚轻的身子，到各班看看炉子，试试室内的温度，看看每个人是否把被子盖好。当他把全队四十多个人的被子全都检查完了以后，才拖着疲乏的身子回去睡觉。
    王队长睡下不久，只见床前走来钻工卢兴山，手里端着一个纸包。卢兴山激动地说：“队长，今晚的事我全看到了。我看到你满脸汗珠，当你给我盖被的时候，只觉得你的手发烫。当时如果不是怕惊动大家，我非把你背回宿舍不可。我没有别的东西表达我的心意，这半斤糖，是我节约下来的保健糖，你收下吧！”卢兴山的话，也感动了王队长。他说：“小卢，盖被子这是我的义务，平时每晚检查两次，今天只检查一次，已经做得很不够了。”
    第二天，卢兴山把这事告诉了大家，同志们深受感动。从此，大伙的干劲更大了。
