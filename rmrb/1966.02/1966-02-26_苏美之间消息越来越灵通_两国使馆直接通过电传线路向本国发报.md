　　Communication Between the Soviet Union and the United States Becomes Increasingly Efficient
    Embassies of Both Countries Directly Send Telegrams to Their Home Countries via Telex Lines
    Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd dispatch from Washington: The U.S. State Department announced on the 21st that, since February 1st of this year, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and the Soviet Embassy in Washington have been able to directly send diplomatic coded telegrams to their respective governments via telex lines. Previously, this communication was conducted through commercial circuits.
    According to State Department Press Officer McCloskey, this has resulted in the communication link between the State Department and its embassy in Moscow being shortened by three and a half to four hours compared to before. The Associated Press pointed out in its report that "this is the result of the State Department's ten-year effort to improve communication with its embassy in Moscow."

　　苏美之间消息越来越灵通
    两国使馆直接通过电传线路向本国发报
    新华社二十三日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院二十一日宣布，美国驻莫斯科大使馆和苏联驻华盛顿大使馆从今年二月一日起已经可以直接通过电传线路，向本国政府拍发外交密码电报。在这以前，这种联络是通过商用电路进行的。
    据国务院新闻发布官麦克洛斯基说，这样做的结果，国务院同它驻莫斯科大使馆之间的通讯联络可比以前节省时间达三个半到四个小时。美联社在报道中指出，“这是国务院十年来为改进同驻莫斯科大使馆的联系而进行努力的结果。”
