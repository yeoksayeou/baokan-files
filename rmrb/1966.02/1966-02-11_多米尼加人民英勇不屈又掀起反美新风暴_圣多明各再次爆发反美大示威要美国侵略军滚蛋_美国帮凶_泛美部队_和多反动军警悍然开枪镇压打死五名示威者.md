    Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch from Santo Domingo: The Dominican people, resolutely opposing American aggression and interference, defying the bayonets of the American aggressor troops, once again held fierce and massive anti-American demonstrations in the capital, Santo Domingo, on the 9th. This demonstration fully demonstrated the Dominican people's heroic spirit of fearlessness in the face of violence and their unwavering courage.
    Nearly one thousand students in Santo Domingo demonstrated in front of the National Palace, the seat of the American-backed reactionary government, on the 9th, demanding that the American aggressor troops withdraw from the Dominican Republic and protesting against American aggression in Vietnam. The angry demonstrators held aloft huge banners reading "Yankees, Go Home!" They constantly shouted anti-American slogans, including "Quisqueya (Dominican Republic) and Vietnam unite and will surely win!" The masses held a rally in front of the National Palace and observed a moment of silence for the South Vietnamese liberation fighters who sacrificed their lives in the war against American aggression before the rally began. As a student leader mounted a stone platform to speak, soldiers of the American-controlled "Pan-American Forces" and Dominican reactionary military police brazenly opened fire and threw tear gas at the assembled masses, killing five demonstrators on the spot and injuring at least forty others. The students bravely used stones and sticks to fight back stubbornly against the military police who came to suppress them, injuring one policeman.
    The atrocities of the American aggressors aroused great anger among the Dominican people. The students who participated in the demonstration regrouped and, together with citizens of the capital, held an anti-American parade in the downtown area of the city center. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Kill the Americans" and "Strike! Strike!" Soldiers of the "Pan-American Forces" opened fire on the masses again. The angry demonstrators fought back again. They severely beat an American news agency reporter who had consistently distorted the patriotic struggle of the Dominican people and killed a reactionary police officer.
    The demonstrators also overturned trash cans, lit garbage fires, and set up barricades. They burned a car belonging to the American Embassy and attacked a vehicle of a United Nations representative who was helping the United States interfere in the Dominican Republic. The fierce demonstrations continued from morning until night. Fearing the powerful anti-American demonstrations by the Dominican people, the American aggressor troops quietly evacuated the staff of the United States Information Service from downtown Santo Domingo on the evening of the 9th.
    Since the United States imposed the so-called "Reconciliation Act" on the Dominican people last September, the anti-American demonstrations by the Dominican people have never stopped. These demonstrations show the Dominican people's boundless hatred for the American aggressors and their unwavering determination to oppose American aggression and defend national sovereignty.

    多米尼加人民英勇不屈又掀起反美新风暴
    圣多明各再次爆发反美大示威要美国侵略军滚蛋
    美国帮凶“泛美部队”和多反动军警悍然开枪镇压打死五名示威者
    新华社十日讯　圣多明各消息：坚决反对美国侵略、干涉的多米尼加人民，不顾美国侵略军的刺刀威胁，九日在首都圣多明各再次举行了激烈的和声势浩大的反美示威。这次示威斗争充分显示了多米尼加人民不畏强暴、坚强不屈的英勇气概。
    圣多明各近一千名学生九日在美国扶植的反动政府所在地国民宫前面举行示威，要求美国侵略军撤出多米尼加，抗议美国侵略越南。愤怒的示威群众高举“美国佬，滚回去！”的巨型标语牌，他们不断高呼反美口号，其中包括“基斯克亚（多米尼加）和越南联合起来必将战胜！”群众在国民宫前举行了大会，并且在集会开始前为在反对美国侵略的战争中牺牲的南越解放战士默哀。当一名学生领袖登上石台准备讲话时，美国控制的“泛美部队”的士兵和多米尼加反动军警悍然向参加集会的群众开枪和投掷催泪弹，当场杀死了五名示威者，至少有四十多人受伤。学生们英勇地用石块和棍棒同前来镇压的军警展开顽强的搏斗，打伤了一名警察。
    美国侵略者的暴行激起多米尼加人民的极大愤怒。参加示威的学生重新集合起来，他们和首都市民一起，在市中心的闹市区举行反美游行。示威者高呼“杀死美国佬”和“罢工！罢工！”等口号。“泛美部队”的士兵再次开枪镇压群众。愤怒的示威者再次进行回击。他们狠狠地揍了一名一贯歪曲报道多米尼加人民爱国斗争的美国通讯社记者，并且打死了一名反动警官。
    示威者还推倒垃圾箱，点燃垃圾，设置路障。他们烧毁了美国大使馆的一辆汽车，并且袭击了帮助美国干涉多米尼加的一名联合国代表的车辆。激烈的示威从早上一直继续到晚上。由于惧怕多米尼加人民强大的反美示威游行，美国侵略军九日晚间把美国新闻处的工作人员从圣多明各闹市区悄悄地撤走。
    从去年九月美国把所谓“和解法”强加在多米尼加人民头上之后，多米尼加人民的反美示威斗争一直没有停止过，这些示威显示了多米尼加人民对美国侵略者的无比仇恨和他们誓死反对美国侵略、保卫国家主权的不可动摇的决心。（附图片）
