    According to a New China News Agency report from New York on the 1st: After brazenly resuming the bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Johnson administration is attempting to use the United Nations Security Council, which has no right to intervene in the Vietnam issue, to promote the US policy of war blackmail and cover up the US crime of expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    The US representative to the United Nations, Goldberg, wrote to the Security Council on January 31, requesting an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in Vietnam. In the letter, Goldberg admitted that the US attempt to use the so-called "bombing pause" to force the Vietnamese people to stop their struggle had failed and that the US's unprecedented "peace offensive" had shamefully gone bankrupt.

    In his letter, Goldberg asked the Security Council to intervene in the Vietnam issue. He said: The US government has come to the conclusion that "the Security Council should proceed urgently and actively to deal with this situation and to make the strongest efforts and to use its unlimited prestige to find a timely solution." He also said that the United States requests "any assistance that may be given" by members of the Security Council or any other body of the United Nations. The United States also submitted a draft resolution to the Security Council, which called on the Security Council to "appeal for immediate unconditional discussions between the appropriate governments in (a certain) month (a certain) day in (a certain) place to arrange a meeting to seek the implementation of the 1954 and 1962 Geneva Agreements and the establishment of lasting peace in Southeast Asia." The draft resolution also stated that "the first matter to be dealt with at such a meeting is the arrangement of a cessation of hostilities under effective supervision."

    The draft also requested "that all appropriate means, including the provision of arbitrators and mediators, be used to help achieve the purposes of this resolution." Western news agencies pointed out that this echoed the Pope's proposal on January 29 that certain countries in the United Nations "arbitrate" the Vietnam issue.

    According to a New China News Agency report from Washington on the 1st: An hour after US President Johnson brazenly announced the resumption of the illegal bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the morning of January 31, Secretary of State Rusk held a press conference to try to defend this naked act of aggression by US imperialism.

    However, Rusk had to admit that the elaborate peace talk fraud planned by the US government had suffered a shameful failure. He said, "I must report with genuine regret that the answer is negative, tough, and unyielding. The successive channels we opened have not achieved any action toward peace. Throughout the period since Christmas, Hanoi and Beijing have used a barrage of adjectives such as 'false,' 'trick,' 'deception,' 'ruse,' 'hoax,' and 'farce' to condemn our efforts toward peace. The negative attitude of Hanoi and the Liberation Front has been clarified in an unequivocal manner in the past few days. Ho Chi Minh, in a letter to some heads of state, said: 'If the United States truly wants peace, it must recognize the South Vietnam National Liberation Front as the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people and negotiate with it.' The Front itself just issued a statement yesterday, saying: 'If US imperialism still refuses to withdraw their troops and various military materials from South Vietnam, any negotiations with US imperialism at present will be completely useless.'"

    Rusk expressed great annoyance that the people of North and South Vietnam did not fall for the US "peace talk" scheme and continued to resolutely strike at the US aggressors. But he indicated that the United States was not prepared to change its counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy on the Vietnam issue. He advocated that the United Nations, an aggressive tool under US control, should interfere in the Vietnam issue and revealed that the initial plan of the United States was to try to use the Security Council to bring the Vietnam issue "toward negotiations or toward the conference table and toward peace." Then, once the time is ripe, the United Nations will "play an extremely beneficial role in observing, guaranteeing, monitoring, patrolling, and ensuring that the agreement is truly implemented."

### 美国侵越政策走到了穷途末路  约翰逊政府要安理会出来帮忙  腊斯克承认“和平攻势”失败　鼓吹联合国插手干涉越南问题

    美国侵越政策走到了穷途末路
    约翰逊政府要安理会出来帮忙腊
    斯克承认“和平攻势”失败　鼓吹联合国插手干涉越南问题
    据新华社一日讯　纽约消息：约翰逊政府在悍然恢复对越南民主共和国的轰炸之后，又企图通过根本无权过问越南问题的联合国安全理事会来推行美国的战争讹诈政策，掩盖美国扩大侵越战争的罪行。
    美国驻联合国代表戈德堡一月三十一日写信给安理会，要求召开紧急会议讨论越南局势。戈德堡在信里承认，美国企图以所谓“暂停轰炸”要越南人民停止斗争的诡计未能得逞，美国空前规模的“和平攻势”可耻地破产了。
    戈德堡在信里要求安理会插手干涉越南问题。他说：美国政府已经得出结论，“安理会应当着手紧急地和积极地处理这个局势，并作出最有力的努力和利用它的无限的威望来找出一个及时的解决办法。”他还说，美国要求得到安理会成员或者联合国其他任何机构“可能给予的任何帮助”。美国还向安理会提出了一项决议草案，这项草案鼓吹安理会“吁请在（某）月（某）日在（某）地在适当的有关政府之间立即无条件地进行讨论，来安排一次会议，以期使得一九五四年和一九六二年的日内瓦协议得到实施并在东南亚建立持久和平”。决议草案还说，“这样一次会议第一件要处理的事务是安排在有效的监督下停止敌对行动”。
    草案还要求“以一切适当的办法，其中包括提供仲裁者和调解者在内来帮助实现本决议的目的”。西方通讯社指出，这一点是同罗马教皇在一月二十九日提出的由联合国中的某些国家来“仲裁”越南问题的主张相呼应的。
    据新华社一日讯　华盛顿消息：在美国总统约翰逊一月三十一日上午悍然宣布恢复对越南民主共和国的非法轰炸的一小时之后，国务卿腊斯克接着举行了记者招待会，竭力为美帝国主义这一赤裸裸的侵略罪行辩解。
    但是，腊斯克不得不承认美国政府所精心策划的这次和谈大骗局遭到了可耻的失败。他说，“我必须抱着真正遗憾的心情报告，答复是否定的，强硬的，毫不让步的。我们打开的接二连三的渠道没有取得走向和平的行动。在圣诞节以来的整个时期，河内和北平谴责我们走向和平的努力时使用了连珠炮似的象‘虚假’、‘诡计’、‘欺骗’、‘诡诈’、‘骗局’‘滑稽剧’等形容词。河内和解放阵线的否定态度在过去几天以明确无误的方式得到了澄清。胡志明在致一些国家首脑的信中说：‘如果美国真正希望和平，它必须承认越南南方民族解放阵线是南越人民唯一真正的代表，并同它进行商谈。’阵线自己在昨天刚发表的一个声明中说：‘如果美帝国主义仍拒绝从南越撤出他们的军队和各种军事物资，目前同美帝国主义的一切谈判就是完全无益的。’”
    腊斯克对越南北方和南方人民不上美国“和谈”骗局的当并且继续坚决打击美国侵略者，表示十分恼怒。但他表示，美国并不准备改变它迄今在越南问题上采取的反革命两手策略。他鼓吹由美国把持下的侵略工具——联合国插手越南问题，并透露，美国的初步打算是企图通过安理会使越南问题“走向谈判或是走向会议桌并走向和平”。然后，在一旦时机成熟时，由联合国在“观察、保障、注视、巡逻、确保协议真正得到执行等方面发挥一种极其有益的作用”。
