    Improving Through Practice
    Li Jiafu, Technician, Shanghai Alcohol Factory

    In the past few years, our factory, in order to better conserve materials such as coal and electricity, has made some improvements in production technology, and explored a path for old enterprises like ours to carry out technological transformation. In the process of innovating technology, I deeply feel that to follow our own path of technological development, we can only improve and progress continuously by listening to Chairman Mao's words and engaging in practice.

    The most typical example is the adoption of the continuous cooking process. In the past, China produced alcohol by using cooking pots, one pot at a time, which was very labor-intensive and particularly wasteful of coal. Later, we wanted to connect the entire cooking process to save manpower and coal. Without data, I and many comrades, with the support of the leadership, did it ourselves. At this time, some people said: "How can Li Jiafu do such a thing!" Hearing this, I thought to myself, things are always done by people, what's there to be afraid of if you don't understand, just practice! Didn't Chairman Mao say that to know the taste of a pear, you have to taste it yourself? Take myself as an example, I used to be a shop assistant, and I learned how to produce alcohol later through practice. Now, to engage in continuous cooking, what is it, if you don't practice it yourself, of course it won't work.

    Researching new technology is certainly not as simple as eating pears. As soon as we started, we encountered many obstacles. First, the entire process was connected, but coal and manpower could not be saved at all. Then, some people said, "It won't work!" The factory leaders didn't see it that way. They said, "Being able to connect it is a big step forward. Roads must be walked step by step, and food must be eaten bite by bite. Having the first step allows you to take the second step. Compared with the original position, the first step is progress. Compared with the next step, it's a new starting point." Later, we gradually overcame a series of problems such as transportation, pressure, flow, and quality, and finally succeeded after a total of forty-three trials. We turned the original twenty-seven operating actions into one action, greatly reducing labor intensity, and also saving a lot of coal.

    We believe that failures in the process of technological revolution should also be viewed from two perspectives. Every failure has its own gains. It can only be said that it is distant from the ultimate goal we want to achieve, and cannot be considered a success. But compared with the previous experiment, although the experiment failed, it is actually progressing and undergoing quantitative change through practice, rather than simply repeating. For example, although the thirtieth experiment failed, it was very different from the tenth and twentieth experiments. Our understanding of things is more comprehensive and deeper. With these many quantitative changes, can we achieve the qualitative change of the forty-third final success. If you are afraid to continue practicing after failing a few times, you will never be able to create or advance.

    在实践中提高
    上海酒精厂技师　李嘉福
    这几年，我们厂里为了更好地节约煤炭、电力等物资，曾经在生产技术上作了一些改进，摸索出了一条象我们这样的老企业如何进行技术改造的道路。在这个革新技术的过程中，我深切地感到：要走我们自己发展技术的道路，只有听毛主席的话，在实践中，才能不断提高，不断前进。
    最典型的事例，便是连续蒸煮这项新工艺的采用。我国过去生产酒精，都是利用一些蒸煮锅，一锅一锅地进行生产的，劳动强度很大，而且特别费煤。后来，我们想把整个蒸煮过程连起来，节约人力和煤炭。没有资料，我和许多同志，在领导的支持下，自己动手搞。这时候，有些人说：“李嘉福怎么干得了这样的事！”我听了，心想，事情总是人做的，不懂，怕啥，实践嘛！毛主席不是说过，要想知道梨子的滋味，就得亲口吃一吃。拿我自己来说，过去是个店员，怎样生产酒精，也是后来在实践中学会的。现在要搞连续蒸煮，它是个啥东西，不亲自实践一下，当然也不行。
    研究新技术，当然不象吃梨子那么简单。一上手，就接连碰到许多钉子。第一步，整个流程连是连起来了，可是煤炭和人力还是一点不能省。于是，有人说：“不行！”厂里的领导干部却不这样看。他们说：“能够连起来，就跨出了一大步。路要一步步走，饭要一口口吃，有了第一步才能走第二步。第一步和原来的位置比，是个进步，和下一步比，是个新起点。”后来，我们就一步一步地克服了输送、压力、流量、质量等一系列的难题，一共试验了四十三次，终于获得了成功。把原来的二十七个操作动作变成了一个动作，劳动强度大大减轻，煤炭也节约很多。
    我们认为，对技术革命过程中的失败，也要一分为二的看。每一次失败，都有每一次的收获，只能说它同我们所要达到的最终目标比，是有距离的，不能算成功。但每一次试验同上一次试验相比，虽然失败，但因为通过实践，实质上是在进步，是在发生量变，而不是简单的重复。如在做第三十多次试验时，虽然失败了，但同第十几次、第二十几次的试验比，就已大不相同。我们对事物的认识更全面、更深化了。有了这许许多多的量变，才能得到第四十三次最后成功的这个质变。如果失败了几次，就不敢继续实践了，那永远是不能有所创造、有所前进的。
