    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 15th: Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said: "The Vietnamese people will surely win. What determines the outcome of the war is not weapons, but people. An unjust war of aggression is bound to fail."

    Nosaka delivered a speech entitled "The Turbulent World and Japan's New Path" to 3,500 listeners in Kumamoto City on the evening of the 14th, powerfully exposing the "peace talks" fraud of U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue. He said: We, the Japanese people, cannot tolerate the Japanese government colluding with this fraud.

    Referring to the rising struggle of the American people against the war of aggression, Nosaka said: "Even some soldiers in the United States are leaving the army to engage in the peace movement. How can the United States even talk about winning?"

    When talking about the domestic situation, Nosaka clarified the path of liberation for the Japanese people as pointed out in the program of the Japanese Communist Party, saying, "Dawn is already breaking in the East."

    Nosaka emphasized the revolutionary tradition of the Japanese Communist Party and the significance of building a strong Communist Party at present. He said that only the Japanese Communist Party can truly fight face-to-face with the U.S.-Japan reactionaries.

    Nosaka's speech was repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, February 15th: According to a broadcast by Pathet Lao Radio: Khamtay Siphandone, representative of the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army, sent a telegram to the Command of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces on the 14th, warmly congratulating the fifth anniversary of "South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces Unification Day."

    The telegram praised the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces for carrying forward the heroic spirit of the heroic Vietnamese nation, annihilating more and more of the invading U.S. troops and their puppet troops, and for their contributions to the great victory in the cause of liberation of South Vietnam.

    The telegram said that the Lao People's Liberation Army has always regarded the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces' battles to annihilate the U.S. bandits and their running dogs as a great contribution to the cause of liberation of the Lao people, and at the same time as a contribution to the liberation struggle of people of all countries against U.S. imperialism and for the defense of world peace.

    The telegram said that at present, in order to save its defeat, U.S. imperialism is strengthening its war of aggression against South Vietnam; in Laos, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are launching large-scale ground and air offensives against the liberated areas. It is also preparing to send troops directly to invade Laos and occupy central and lower Laos as a bridgehead connecting the South Vietnam battlefield and its military bases in Thailand. Therefore, the Lao People's Liberation Army must strengthen its solidarity with the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces in order to eliminate the common enemy—U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

    野坂主席说越南人民必定会胜利
    西番顿电贺越南南方解放武装力量统一日
    据新华社十五日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三说：“越南人民必定会胜利。决定战争的结局的不是武器，而是人。不正义的侵略战争是一定要失败的。”
    野坂主席十四日晚在熊本市向三千五百个听众发表了题为《动荡的世界和日本的新道路》的演说，有力地揭露了美帝国主义在越南问题上的“和谈”骗局。他说：我们日本人民不能容忍日本政府同这种骗局串通一气。
    野坂主席在谈到高涨的美国人民反对侵略战争的斗争时说：“甚至在美国的士兵中也有人脱离军队从事和平运动。美国怎样谈得上取胜呢。”
    野坂主席在谈到国内形势时，阐明了日本共产党纲领所指出的日本人民解放的道路，他说：“现在东方已经在破晓。”
    野坂主席强调了日本共产党的革命传统和目前建立一个强大的共产党的意义，他说，能够真正同美日反动派面对面作斗争的只有日本共产党。
    野坂主席的演说一再被暴风雨般的掌声所打断。
    新华社康开十五日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝人民解放军最高指挥部代表坎代·西番顿十四日打电报给越南南方解放武装力量指挥部，热烈祝贺“越南南方解放武装力量统一日”五周年。
    贺电赞扬越南南方解放武装力量发扬英雄越南民族的英勇精神，歼灭越来越多的美国侵略军及其走狗的军队，为越南南方解放事业取得巨大胜利所作出的贡献。
    贺电说，老挝人民解放军一贯把越南南方解放武装力量歼灭美国强盗及其走狗的战斗，看作是对老挝人民的解放事业作出的巨大贡献，同时也是对世界各国人民反对美帝国主义、保卫世界和平的解放斗争所作出的贡献。
    贺电说，目前，美帝国主义为了挽救它的失败，正在强化对越南南方的侵略战争；在老挝，美帝国主义及其走狗正在对解放区展开地面和空中的大规模进攻。它还准备直接出兵侵略老挝，占领中寮和下寮地区，以作为连接越南南方战场和它在泰国的军事基地的桥头堡。因此，老挝人民解放军必须加紧同越南南方解放武装力量的团结，以便消灭共同敌人——美帝国主义及其走狗。
