    (Xinhua News Agency, Quito, 4th) Quito News: On the 3rd, university students in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, once again held an anti-American demonstration in front of the American Embassy.

    This demonstration erupted as a new wave of anti-American and anti-dictatorial sentiment among Quito residents entered its seventh day. Despite the authorities declaring martial law as early as January 27 and subsequently carrying out widespread arrests, workers, students, and people from other strata have been continuously taking to the streets since the 28th to protest the brutal rule of American imperialism and its Ecuadorian dictatorial government over the people.

    On the evening of January 31, people still gathered in groups to hold similar demonstrations.

    On the 1st, students once again took to the streets to demonstrate, protesting the dictatorial government's barbaric suppression on January 28 and demanding the release of those arrested. According to reports, the dictatorial authorities once again dispatched military police to suppress the students, using tear gas and vomiting gas. The students fought back bravely with stones. The students also attacked the American-Ecuadorian Cultural Center with stones and homemade bombs. This institution, funded by the United States for the purpose of cultural aggression, immediately caught fire. It is reported that police arrested another six youths during the suppression.

    On the 3rd, while a group of students held a demonstration in front of the American Embassy, many other university students held marches in the streets, shouting anti-dictatorial slogans such as "We want a constitution! We want a constitution!" marching directly towards Independence Square where the National Palace is located. The police waved batons and threw tear gas at the crowd, carrying out brutal suppression once again. The demonstrating masses retaliated against the police with stones and attacked police cars, and there were many clashes between the two sides. In the early morning, the residence of the Dean of the Military Academy was also damaged by a bomb attack.

    At the same time, the Quito branch of the Ecuadorian University Students Federation issued an announcement strongly condemning the crimes of the dictatorial government and the brutal act of sending military police into schools on the 2nd. The announcement pointed out that the Ecuadorian people are determined to "overthrow the enemies of the people" and that they "will not stop in front of cavalry and bayonets."

    The right-wing newspaper *El Tiempo* ("The Times") also had to admit in an editorial on the 3rd that "a turbulent situation has formed (in Ecuador) and is becoming increasingly alarming, reflecting a widespread national disagreement with the current government continuing to hold power."

    决心打倒人民公敌  绝不在刺刀下屈服
    厄瓜多尔人民坚持反美反独裁斗争
    连日示威群众反击军警镇压并爆炸美国文化侵略机构
    据新华社四日讯　基多消息：厄瓜多尔首都基多的大学生三日再次在美国大使馆前面举行反美示威。
    这次示威是在基多居民的反美、反独裁的新的浪潮进入第七天的时候爆发的。尽管当局早在一月二十七日就宣布实行戒严令并且接着大肆捕人，但是，从二十八日起，工人、学生和其他阶层的人民不断上街游行，抗议美帝国主义及其厄瓜多尔独裁政府对人民的残暴统治。
    一月三十一日晚上，人们仍成群结队地上街举行同样的示威。
    一日，学生再次上街举行示威游行，抗议独裁政府在一月二十八日的野蛮镇压，要求当局释放被捕的人。据报道，独裁当局再次出动军警镇压学生，使用了催泪和作呕瓦斯。学生们用石块还击，进行英勇抵抗。学生们还用石头和土制炸弹袭击了美国—厄瓜多尔文化中心。这个由美国资助的用来进行文化侵略的机构立刻烧了起来。据报道，警察在镇压行动中又逮捕了六名青年。
    三日，当一群学生在美国大使馆前面举行示威的同时，另外许多大学生在街上举行了游行，高呼“要宪法！要宪法！”等反独裁口号，直奔国民宫所在的独立广场。警察挥舞棍子，对人群扔催泪弹，再次进行残暴镇压。示威群众用石块向警察还击，并且攻击了警车，双方发生了许多次冲突。在清晨的时候，军事学院院长的住宅还挨了一枚炸弹，遭到了破坏。
    同时，厄瓜多尔大学生联合会基多分会发表了一项公告，强烈谴责独裁政府的罪行以及在二日派军警进驻学校的残暴行为。公告指出，厄瓜多尔人民决心“打倒人民的敌人”，他们“不会在马队和刺刀前面止步”。
    右派报纸《时代报》三日在社论中也不得不承认，“（在厄瓜多尔）动荡的局面已经形成，而且越来越具有惊人的规模，这反映了全国普遍不同意目前政府继续执政的情绪”。
