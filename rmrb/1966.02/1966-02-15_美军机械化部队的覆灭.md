    The Annihilation of the US Military's Mechanized Forces

    On a clear day after a rain in late 1965, we arrived at a forest in Thu Dau Mot Province, South Vietnam, to visit a People's Liberation Army unit that was celebrating its victory and summarizing its combat experience. A few days earlier, this unit, filled with deep hatred for US imperialism and with an invincible heroic spirit, completely annihilated forty amphibious armored vehicles and armored personnel carriers of the US military's mechanized forces, as well as five hundred American "ace" soldiers, in just fifty minutes.

    In mid-November, the South Vietnam Liberation Army swiftly annihilated a main battalion of the puppet army in the Dau Tieng area. The US military, unwilling to accept defeat, decided to act themselves, thinking their running dogs were useless. A battalion from the US 1st Infantry Division marched in to reinforce, but found nothing, as the Liberation Army soldiers had already moved after their victorious battle. On the 20th, as a US tank convoy was returning with this battalion, a unit of the Thu Dau Mot Province Liberation Army was waiting for them near the village of Gan Ga, where the US tank convoy had to pass.

    As the US tank convoy, moving along a red dirt road, appeared, it was met with repeated obstruction and harassment from a platoon of the Liberation Army and local people's guerrillas. For more than five hours, from 12:00 to 17:00, this mechanized "fast" unit of the US military crawled along for only nine kilometers. After much effort, just as they had crossed a wooden bridge that had been destroyed by the guerrillas, they fell into a trap set by the Liberation Army. The Liberation Army soldiers, hidden in the area of Gan Ga village, waited for the US tanks to enter the ambush zone. Their heavy machine guns and light machine guns swept fiercely at the enemy, and shells and grenades rained down on them. With the sound of gunfire, the soldiers charged towards the enemy like tigers descending from the mountains. One unit blocked the enemy's advance, preventing their escape; another unit cut the US tank convoy in half, holding off the tanks behind and preventing them from providing support. Two other units launched increasingly fierce charges at the enemies caught in the middle, disrupting the American invaders' formation. Then, the heroic soldiers, ignoring the bombing and strafing by enemy aircraft, quickly divided the enemy into many small pieces and eliminated them one by one.

    Before the battle, these heroic Liberation Army soldiers had denounced the heinous crimes committed by the American invaders against their motherland and their loved ones at a denunciation meeting. The deputy platoon leader, Nguyen Nam, had his sister crushed to death by a US military M-113 amphibious armored vehicle, and his younger brother was killed by American artillery shells. Now the invaders were right in front of them, and hatred was heightened when enemies met. When the battle first started, he and his comrades were hiding in the tall grass along the road. The American devils on the road, upon being attacked, screamed. He and his comrades immediately threw a row of grenades at the source of the screams. With the explosion of the grenades, they leaped out of the grass and charged at the enemy. He saw an American soldier still yelling into a radio on a tank, so he immediately ordered rocket launcher shooter Nguyen Anh to fire a shot. The American soldier and his radio were blown away together. The American soldiers on another tank fired wildly at them. Nguyen Anh fired another shot at them, and the invading tank burst into flames. Seeing the situation was bad, the American soldiers on the tanks behind jumped off and hid behind and under the vehicles, firing their guns randomly. Nguyen Nam threw a grenade behind the vehicles and took the opportunity to charge forward, causing the enemy to scream incessantly.

    The soldiers who blocked the enemy's advance displayed a spirit of bravery, tenacity, and a willingness to fight at close quarters, beating the American invaders bloody. Yang Wenlang, the political instructor of the first company, encouraged the soldiers to fight bravely and led the charge against the enemy. They eliminated four M-113 amphibious armored vehicles in one go. When a squad of enemies charged towards the soldiers of the first squad of the first company of the Liberation Army, squad leader Cha Wannang said to everyone, "Stay calm and wait for the enemy to get close before firing!" When the enemy was only five meters away, their machine guns, submachine guns, and rocket launchers opened fire all at once, instantly "writing off" the entire squad of enemies. Then, fifteen American soldiers charged up. When they were very close, the soldiers' grenades accurately landed among the American invaders, causing these American "ace" soldiers to roll, crawl, wail like ghosts, and expose their ugliness.

    Under the fierce attack of the Liberation Army, some of the American tanks overturned; some burst into flames and smoke; some only cared about fleeing for their lives, rushing over the bodies of fallen American wounded soldiers, breaking their legs and crushing their heads. In addition, the US aircraft that came to rescue bombed and strafed wildly, causing many American wounded soldiers to suffer greatly and scream loudly. The Liberation Army soldiers hiding in the forest, who were responsible for anti-aircraft fire, joked about the liveliness of the US's joint land-air operation, and calmly aimed at the enemy aircraft and fired, causing the enemy aircraft to forget about rescuing the American soldiers on the ground and flee with their tails between their legs.

    The Liberation Army soldiers who cut off the enemy's reinforcements stood like Mount Tai, and no matter how the enemy attacked, they never allowed the American tanks to advance a single step. M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, one after another, and groups of American soldiers, repeatedly attacked the soldiers of the fourth squad of the second company stationed there. However, under the leadership of Company Commander Xie Guangbi, the soldiers calmly resisted and beat the US military back time after time. Their recoilless rifle shells and grenades destroyed twelve tanks and killed or wounded the American soldiers charging with the tanks in the four attacks of the US military. When the enemy launched their fifth attack, Squad Leader Nguyen Van Gai of the fourth squad said to all the soldiers: "The brother units are concentrating their forces behind us to eliminate the enemy. We must hold off the invaders in front of us. In order to ensure the victory of the entire battle, we must defend our position even if only one person is left!" They and the soldiers of the brother squads and platoons engaged in fierce battles with the large US tank units until the US military was completely wiped out and the entire unit was safely transferred. Only then did they withdraw from the battle.

    As the reporter finished the interview and said goodbye, a commander who participated in this battle said to the reporter: "Originally, our unit did not know much about the US military's mechanized forces. The commanders and fighters only relied on hatred to fight. After the Bao Bang and this battle, we personally fought them. To be honest, the American soldiers are no match for us. Just like our soldiers said: 'If I am not afraid of it, it will be afraid of me. The closer we fight, the more afraid it becomes.' No matter how many more soldiers the United States sends, we will definitely be able to defeat them."

### 美军机械化部队的覆灭

    美军机械化部队的覆灭
    一九六五年年底的一个雨后晴朗日子里，我们来到越南南方土龙木省的一片遮天蔽日的树林里，访问了一支正在那里欢庆胜利和总结作战经验的解放军部队。几天前，这支部队怀着对美帝国主义的深仇大恨，以有我无敌的英雄气概，在短短的五十分钟里，就把美军机械化部队的四十辆两栖装甲车和装甲运兵车以及五百名美国“王牌”军，干净彻底地歼灭了。
    十一月中旬，越南南方解放军在油汀地区以迅雷不及掩耳之势，一举歼灭了伪军一个主力营。美军不甘心失败，认为走狗不行，于是亲自出马。美国第一步兵师的一个营浩浩荡荡前去增援，但是扑了个空，解放军战士在胜利结束战斗后早已转移了。二十日，美军一支战车队载着这个营往回走时，土龙木省解放军某部，却在美军战车队必须经过的甘车村一带等候着。
    沿着一条红土公路往回走的美军战车队，一露头，就遭到解放军一个排和当地人民游击队的节节阻击和袭扰，从十二时到十七时许的五个多钟头里，美军这支机械化“快速”部队，才爬行了九公里。当他们费了九牛二虎之力，刚刚通过一座遭到游击队破坏的木桥后，便陷入了解放军布下的天罗地网中。隐蔽在甘车村一带的解放军战士，等美军的战车进入伏击区，他们的重机枪、轻机枪向敌人猛扫，炮弹和手榴弹一齐飞到了敌人头上。随着枪炮的响声，战士们象下山的猛虎一样扑向敌人。一支部队拦在敌人的前头猛打，不让它逃走；一支部队把美军战车队拦腰斩断，并且顶住后面的战车，使它们不得上前支援。另两支部队向被夹在中间的敌人发起一阵比一阵猛烈的冲锋，把美国强盗的阵容，打得乱七八糟。然后，英雄的战士们不顾前来援救的敌机的轰炸扫射，迅速把敌人分割成很多小块，逐一加以消灭。
    战斗前，这些英雄的解放军战士，都在控诉大会上声讨了美国侵略者对他们的祖国和亲人所犯下的滔天罪行。副排长阮南的妹妹被美军M—113两栖装甲车碾死了，弟弟也被美国炮弹炸死了。现在强盗们就在眼前，仇人相见分外眼红。战斗刚刚打响的时候，他和战友们埋伏在路边的茅草丛里，公路上的美国鬼子遭到袭击后，吓得哇哇直叫。他和战友们立即向发出叫声的地方扔去一排手榴弹。随着手榴弹的爆炸，他们跃出草丛，向敌人杀去。只见一个美国兵还在一辆战车上用报话机乱叫，他立即命令火箭筒射手阮英打过去一炮，那个美国兵和他的报话机，一起被打飞了。另一辆战车上的美军，向他们疯狂扫射，阮英对准他们又是一炮，这辆强盗战车随即燃起了熊熊烈火。后面战车上的美军见势不妙，纷纷从战车上跳了下来，躲在车后面和车底下乱放枪。阮南朝车后扔去手榴弹，并乘机冲了上去，打得敌人惨叫不迭。
    迎头堵住敌人去路的战士们，发扬了英勇顽强和勇于近战的精神，将美国侵略军揍得头破血流。一连政治指导员杨文朗，一面鼓励战士们奋勇杀敌，一面带头冲向敌人，他们一股作气消灭了四辆M—113两栖装甲车。当一个班的敌人向解放军一连一班的战士冲来时，班长茶文囊对大家说：“沉住气，等敌人靠近再打！”敌人只有五米远时，他们的机枪、冲锋枪、火箭筒一齐开火了，一下子便把这个班的敌人全部“报销”了。接着，又冲上来十五个美国兵，等到距离很近时，战士们的手榴弹又准确地在美国强盗群里开了花，打得这些美国
  “王牌”军滚的滚，爬的爬，鬼哭狼嚎，丑态百出。
    在解放军的猛烈打击下，美军战车有的东倒西歪；有的燃起浓烟烈火；有的只顾自己夺路逃窜，急得从倒在地上的美军伤兵身上开过去，使有的伤兵被压断了腿，有的被压扁了头。再加上前来救援的美国飞机狂轰乱炸，使得好多美国伤兵大吃苦头，哇啦哇啦地乱叫。隐蔽在树林里担任对空射击的解放军战士，一面笑谈着美国这场陆空联合作战的热闹，一面沉着地瞄准敌机射击，打得敌机顾不得救援地面的美国兵，夹着尾巴逃命了。
    拦腰斩断后面救援的敌军的解放军战士，象泰山一样屹立着，任凭敌人怎样攻击，始终没有让美军战车前进一步。一辆接一辆的M—113两栖装甲车，一群一群的美国兵，向坚守在那里的二连四班战士连续攻击。但是，战士们在连长谢光比的带领下，沉着迎击，把美军一次次地打下去。他们的无后座力炮弹和手榴弹，在美军四次进攻中，就击毁了十二辆战车和杀伤了跟随战车冲锋的美国兵。当敌人进行第五次进攻时，四班班长阮文盖向全班战士说：“兄弟连队正在我们背后集中力量消灭敌人，我们一定要顶住面前的强盗。为了保证整个战斗的胜利，就是剩下最后一个人也要坚守阵地！”他们和兄弟班排的战士，同美军大队战车展开激战，直到把美军全部消灭，整个部队安全转移后，他们才撤出战斗。
    当记者结束访问告别时，一位参加这次战斗的指挥员向记者说：“原先我们这支部队对美军机械化部队还不大摸底，指战员只凭着仇恨去作战，经过保邦和这次战斗，我们亲自同它们较量过了，老实说，美国兵不是我们的对手。正象我们的战士说的：‘我不怕它，它就怕我，越靠近打，它就越怕’。不管美国增派多少兵来，我们都一定能打败它。”
