　　Modern Peking Opera First Performed Abroad
　　——A Record of the China Youth Peking Opera Troupe's Visit to Burma
    The China Youth Peking Opera Troupe visited Burma from January 5th to February 2nd. In less than a month, the Peking Opera troupe performed eighteen shows in Rangoon, Bassein, and Mandalay, with nearly 70,000 viewers. Their performances of modern Peking Opera and traditional excerpts were warmly welcomed by the audience.

　　Come from Afar to See It First
    Chinese Peking Opera art is not unfamiliar to Burmese audiences. Before this, Chinese Peking Opera troupes had visited Burma twice. However, modern Peking Opera was like "the first thunder of spring" for Burmese audiences. At the same time, this was the first time that Chinese modern Peking Opera met audiences abroad.
    During the Peking Opera troupe's performances in Burma, not only was every show fully packed, but many people stood to watch each show. When there was no more room inside, people gathered outside the venue and listened to the music and singing through loudspeakers. Whether in Rangoon, Bassein, or Mandalay, most of the tickets were sold out several days in advance. At the ticket offices, people lined up day and night, and many people came from all directions specifically to buy tickets. According to a Burmese friend, when the Peking Opera troupe performed in Mandalay, people from fifty or sixty surrounding areas traveled long distances to see the show. No matter how far, how tiring the journey, or how expensive the travel, they were satisfied as long as they could enjoy a performance of Chinese modern Peking Opera. This shows that the Burmese audience holds deep feelings for the Chinese people who are building a new life, and they have a strong interest in Chinese modern Peking Opera.

　　Collective Spirit is Deeply Moving
　 《Fighting the Flood》, the only large-scale modern Peking Opera brought by the Peking Opera troupe, was one of the most well-received modern dramas in Burma. It was performed for four or five consecutive shows in Rangoon, each time with a full house. This is a drama that uses traditional art forms to express a broad modern struggle. It depicts the moving story of the critical moment when a massive flood threatened the industrial town of Tianjin and the vital transportation arteries of the Jinghan and Jinpu Railways. The members of the People's Commune, recognizing the overall situation, would rather breach the dikes and let the flood wash away their homes in order to save Tianjin and the vital transportation arteries. When the People's Liberation Army soldiers and People's Commune members jumped into the raging torrent to plug the breach, when people grabbed Zheng Hongshu's hand one by one, passionately and righteously demanding: "Let me go to breach the dike!" "Let me go to breach the dike!" thousands of viewers almost held their breath, and the entire audience was silent, watching this tense scene. The Chinese people's spirit of sacrificing their lives to protect the collective infected the audience. When the people in the play overcame the flood, thunderous applause erupted from the audience. One audience member gave a thumbs up and said: "Fighting the Flood is great, its theme is vast, its content is novel, and it uses traditional art to express the spirit of the new era... Through this play, we see how the Chinese people solve the contradiction between local interests and overall interests."
    The three small modern dramas brought by the Peking Opera troupe to the Burmese audience were also well received. 《Delivering Fertilizer》is a civil drama without martial arts, but the struggle between individual and collective interests that unfolded around a bucket of manure by the three characters in the play, and the strong comedic conflict filled with this struggle, continuously aroused hearty laughter from the audience. The audience praised 《Little Sisters of the Grassland》, saying: "It doesn't just describe how a pair of grassland little sisters overcame a snowstorm to protect the commune's flock of sheep, it is an epitome of the Chinese people overcoming difficulties to build a new life!" 《Letting the Horse》 was hailed by Burmese audiences as a drama that "embodies the new spirit of the Chinese people." A famous Burmese cultural figure said: "Although there is no horse on the stage, the two male and female actors waving two horse whips, through beautiful dance movements, made us see the horses galloping, neighing, climbing mountains, and crossing rivers. Everything is so realistic, so vivid, so great!"

　　Modern Drama is Inspiring
    Audiences generally reflected that they loved modern Peking Opera. They believed that modern dramas are "inspiring," "educationally significant," and "reflect contemporary life, making them easier to understand than traditional dramas." A person in the press said, "Modern Peking Opera is not only new in content, it is socialist drama, socialist content, and the new content has also created new artistic forms. Therefore, modern Peking Opera is a successful creation of Chinese people's artists."
    The visit of the China Youth Peking Opera Troupe enabled the audience to see not only the development achievements of Chinese Peking Opera art, but also the growth of young Chinese art workers. Once, some citizens wanted to see the actress who played the "jack-of-all-trades" old woman in 《Delivering Fertilizer》. When they saw that the white-haired old woman on the stage was actually an eighteen-year-old girl, they were all amazed. And when they learned that the youngest actor in the troupe was only sixteen years old, and the oldest was only twenty-seven years old, they were even more surprised.
    During the days when the Youth Peking Opera Troupe visited Burma, they were warmly welcomed wherever they went. In Rangoon, whenever the Peking Opera troupe took a car from the hotel to the theater, people waved to them when they saw them. When visiting Bassein, many people ran out of their homes to meet the Peking Opera troupe actors. They said almost in unison: "Your performances are really wonderful, we want to see every show!"

### 现代京剧第一次到国外演出——记中国青年京剧团访问缅甸

　　现代京剧第一次到国外演出
　　——记中国青年京剧团访问缅甸
    中国青年京剧团从一月五日到二月二日访问了缅甸。在不到一个月的时间里，京剧团先后在仰光、勃生和曼德勒演出了十八场，观众近七万人。他们演出的现代京剧和传统的折子戏，都受到了观众的热烈欢迎。
　　远道而来　一睹为快
    中国的京剧艺术对缅甸观众来说并不陌生。在这以前，中国的京剧团曾两度访问过缅甸。但是，现代京剧对于缅甸观众来说却是“春雷第一声”。同时，这也是中国现代京剧第一次在国外同观众会见。
    京剧团在缅甸演出期间，不仅场场座无虚席，而且每一场都有许多人站着看戏。场内站不下，人们就聚集在场外，通过扩音器听音乐和唱腔。不论是在仰光、勃生或是曼德勒，绝大部分入场票都在几天以前销售一空。在售票处，人们日夜排着长长的队伍，还有许多人从四面八方专程赶来买票。据一位缅甸朋友说，京剧团在曼德勒演出时，周围有五六十个地区的人们远道赶来看戏，不管路途多遥远，多劳累，也不管旅费多昂贵，只要能欣赏一次中国现代京剧，他们就如愿以偿。这表明，缅甸观众对正在建设新生活的中国人民怀抱着深厚的感情，他们对中国的现代京剧具有强烈的兴趣。
　　集体精神　感人至深
　 《战洪图》，是京剧团带来的唯一大型现代京剧，是在缅甸最获好评的现代剧目之一。它在仰光连演四、五场，场场满座。这是一出利用传统艺术形式表现一个广阔的现代斗争的戏剧。它描绘特大洪水威胁工业重镇天津和交通大动脉京汉和津浦铁路的紧急关头，人民公社的社员认清大局，宁愿扒开堤防，让洪水冲走自己的家园，从而保住天津和交通大动脉的动人故事。当剧中解放军战士和人民公社社员跳进滚滚的激流里抢堵决口，当人们一个个拉着郑洪叔的手，激昂慷慨地要求：“让我去扒决口！”“让我去扒决口！”的时候，几千名观众几乎屏住了呼吸，全场鸦雀无声，注视着这紧张的场面。中国人民这种舍死忘生、保卫集体的精神，感染着观众。当剧中人们战胜洪水的时候，观众席也随着爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。有一位观众伸出大拇指说：“战洪图就是好，它的主题浩瀚，内容新颖，用传统的艺术表现出了新时代的风貌，……通过这出戏，我们看到了中国人民如何解决局部利益和整体利益的矛盾问题。”
    京剧团带给缅甸观众的三个小型现代戏也同样受到了人们的喜爱。《送肥记》是一出没有武打的文戏，但是，三个剧中人围绕一桶粪而展开的个人利益和集体利益的斗争，以及这场斗争中充满的强烈的喜剧性冲突，不断引起全场观众朗朗的笑声。观众赞扬《草原小姐妹》说：“那不只是描写一对草原小姐妹如何战胜暴风雪保住公社羊群，那是中国人民克服困难建设新生活的缩影！”《让马》被缅甸观众誉为一出“体现中国人民新风尚”的戏剧。一位著名的缅甸文化界人士说：“舞台上虽然没有马，但是两个男女演员挥舞着两支马鞭，通过优美的舞蹈动作，却使我们看到了骏马在飞驰，在嘶叫，在爬山，在过河，一切都是那样逼真，那样形象，好极了！”
　　现代剧目　鼓舞人心
    观众普遍反映，他们喜爱京剧现代戏。他们认为，现代剧目“鼓舞人心”、“教育意义大”，“反映了当代的生活，比传统剧目更易于理解”。一位报界人士说，“现代京剧不仅内容是新的，是社会主义的剧情，是社会主义的内容，而且新的内容也创造了艺术的新形式。因此，现代京剧是中国人民艺术家的成功创造”。
    中国青年京剧团的访问使观众不仅看到了中国京剧艺术的发展成果，同时也看到了中国青年艺术工作者的成长。有一次，一些市民想看看在《送肥记》里扮演“样样管”老大娘的演员。当他们看到舞台上这位白发苍苍的老大娘竟是一个十八岁的姑娘时，他们都惊讶不已。而当他们得知全团的演员最小的只有十六岁，最大的也不过二十七岁时，他们就更惊奇了。
    青年京剧团在缅甸访问的日子里，所到之处都受到了热情的欢迎。在仰光，每当京剧团从旅馆乘车去剧场时，人们见了就向他们招手致意。在游览勃生市容的时候，许多人从家里跑出来，同京剧团演员会见，他们几乎异口同声地说：“你们的演出真精采，我们每场都想看！”
