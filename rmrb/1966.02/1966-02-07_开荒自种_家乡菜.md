    Doing it Ourselves, Frugality Becomes the Style
    Our older generation of revolutionaries, along the banks of the Yan River, used to weave cloth and cultivate land themselves, living in cave dwellings they dug themselves, and eating millet they grew themselves. The people of Daqing inherited the revolutionary traditions of Yan'an, living in "dry-packed earth" houses they built themselves, and eating grain and vegetables they grew themselves. The people of Daqing say: In the war years, we had to work hard and practice thrift and economy, and in the construction years, we should pay even more attention to hard work and thrift and economy. The Daqing Spirit is the inheritance and development of the Yan'an Spirit, and it is the Yan'an Spirit of the construction period.
    Opening Up Wasteland to Grow "Hometown Vegetables"
    Driller Zhao Defu
    We decided to open up wasteland to grow vegetables ourselves, but we couldn't get many vegetable seeds, so we just stared blankly. More than ten days later, the instructor received a small package from Gansu, but the sender didn't write their name or address. He opened it and found it was a small box full of cabbage seeds, with a note in the middle. It said: "We heard that your team doesn't have vegetable seeds to plant, so we are sending you one jin and two liang of cabbage seeds grown in our field. This kind of cabbage has large leaves and is suitable for eating fresh or pickling. Please don't dislike them, accept them. May the Gansu cabbage spread its seeds and descendants in Daqing."
    Now the instructor understood: it must have been one of our comrades who asked their family to send them. But who asked them to send them? He asked all the Gansu people in the team one by one. It turned out that it was the driver, Elder Liu, who asked his family to send them to the team. The instructor praised this spirit of loving the team as if it were his own home in front of all the workers.
    After that, every time in late spring and early summer, the team headquarters would receive vegetable seeds sent from many provinces. Whenever the comrades ate the fresh vegetables grown from these vegetable seeds, they would call them "hometown vegetables."

### 开荒自种“家乡菜”

    自己动手　勤俭成风
    我们老一代的革命者，曾经在延河岸边，自己动手，织布种田，住的是自己打的窑洞，吃的是自己种的小米；大庆人继承了延安的革命传统，住的是自己造的“干打垒”，吃的是自己种的粮食、青菜。大庆人说：战争年代要艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约，建设年代更要注意艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约。大庆精神是延安精神的继承和发扬，是建设时期的延安精神。
    开荒自种“家乡菜”
    司钻　赵德福
    我们决定自己开荒种菜，可菜种弄不到很多，只好干瞪眼。十多天之后，指导员接到了从甘肃寄来的一个小包，寄件人没写姓名、地址。他打开一看，原来是满满的一小匣白菜籽，中间还放着一张纸条。上面写着：“听说你队没菜籽种地，我们把自己田里种的一斤二两白菜籽给你们寄去。这种白菜棵大叶茂，适合鲜吃或腌着吃。请不要嫌弃，收下吧。愿甘肃的白菜在大庆传种接子。”
    这下指导员才明白：一定是咱们的同志叫家里寄来的。可是谁叫寄来的呢？他把全队几个甘肃人找来挨个问。原来是司机长老刘叫家给队上寄来的。指导员把这种爱队如家的精神，在全队职工面前提出来表扬。
    以后，每当春末夏初的时候，队部总能收到一些从很多省寄来的菜种。每当同志们吃到用这些菜种种出来的鲜菜时，都管它叫“家乡菜”。
