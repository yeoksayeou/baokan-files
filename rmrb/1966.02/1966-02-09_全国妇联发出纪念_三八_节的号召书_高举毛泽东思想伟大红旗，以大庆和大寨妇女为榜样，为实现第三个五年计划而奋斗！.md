    The festival for working women worldwide to fight for liberation, "March 8th" International Working Women's Day, is approaching. Women across the country are welcoming this glorious festival with confidence and strides of progress.
    This year is the first year of our country's Third Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy, marking a new stage of development for our national economy. Currently, the socialist education movement in urban and rural areas is developing in depth, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of people has greatly increased, industrial and agricultural production has risen comprehensively, and the movement to learn from, catch up with, help, and surpass each other in increasing production and practicing economy is flourishing. The whole country has seen an unprecedentedly excellent situation. As we commemorate this year's "March 8th" International Working Women's Day under this excellent situation, we must hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take the women of Daqing and Dazhai as examples, and put the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at the top of all our work, using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism and the guide for our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Now, a mass movement of consciously studying Chairman Mao's works has taken shape on an unprecedentedly broad scale in our country. The broad masses of working women and other revolutionary women, with deep class feelings, study Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and actively engage in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment. On all fronts, many advanced women who creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works have emerged. Mao Zedong Thought has become a powerful driving force for promoting the conscious revolution and thorough revolution of women throughout the country.
    The women of Daqing and the women of Dazhai are two distinct banners in the country's women who creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. Under the leadership of the Party, they take Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, and class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link, adhere to the socialist direction, promote proletarian ideology, eliminate bourgeois ideology, stand firm, love and hate distinctly, and continuously and thoroughly carry out the revolution. They hold high the red banner of the general line of socialist construction, adhere to the policy of self-reliance, striving for prosperity, hard work, and building the country with diligence and thrift, strive to learn cultural and scientific knowledge, improve labor skills, and with the revolutionary spirit of working hard, working diligently, working skillfully, and working practically, rely on their own hands, start businesses arduously, dare to climb the peaks of science, and give full play to the role of women as "half the sky" in production and labor. They closely link diligence and thrift in managing the household with diligence and thrift in building the country, adhere to the fine tradition of hard work and plain living, and promote the spirit of saving every grain of rice, every inch of cloth, and every cent of money. In the practice of the three great revolutions, they have tempered their thinking and acquired solid skills, have the motherland in their hearts, have the world in their sights, and have made great contributions to building a new socialist countryside and a new socialist enterprise, opening up a broad path for the thorough liberation of women, and setting a brilliant example for the revolutionization of women throughout the country.
    We women throughout the country must strive to learn from the glorious example of the revolutionization of the women of Daqing and Dazhai, and learn from the spirit of Comrade Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande, who are wholeheartedly devoted to the revolution. The most fundamental thing is to learn from their emphasis on politics, adherence to Mao Zedong Thought in command, taking Chairman Mao's instructions as the highest criterion for their thoughts and actions, and implementing them in the three great revolutionary struggles. More consciously and actively participate in the socialist education movement in urban and rural areas, actively devote themselves to the new upsurge of industrial and agricultural production, and always pay attention to the development of the class struggle situation on the international scene. It is particularly worthy of our high vigilance that, as we continue to achieve great victories on all fronts of socialist revolution and socialist construction, US imperialism is stepping up its expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam and is plotting to impose the war on the Chinese people. Modern revisionists are even more baselessly and shamelessly serving US imperialism, thereby exacerbating the danger of US imperialism expanding its aggression and war. We must strengthen the unity with the women of socialist countries, strengthen the unity with the working women of all countries in the world, resolutely oppose US imperialism, the most ferocious enemy of the people of the world; we must resolutely support the Vietnamese people standing at the forefront of the anti-US struggle; we must strengthen the concept of war preparedness and be ready at any time to meet and crush the US aggressors who dare to attack our country. While opposing the policy of aggression and the policy of war of US imperialism, we must carry the struggle against modern revisionism through to the end.
    Women throughout the country! Let us hold even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of the Party, at our respective posts, redouble our efforts, and make new and greater contributions to the realization of the Third Five-Year Plan, to aid Vietnam in resisting the United States, and to support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.
                                       All-China Women's Federation

    全国妇联发出纪念“三八”节的号召书
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以大庆和大寨妇女为榜样，为实现第三个五年计划而奋斗！
    全世界劳动妇女争取解放的节日，“三八”国际劳动妇女节即将到来。全国妇女正满怀信心，迈开跃进的步伐来迎接这个光辉的节日。
    今年，是我国发展国民经济第三个五年计划的第一年，这标志着我国国民经济进入了一个新的发展时期。目前，全国城乡社会主义教育运动正在深入发展，广大人民的社会主义觉悟大大提高，工农业生产全面高涨，比学赶帮超的增产节约运动正在蓬勃开展。全国出现了一个空前未有的大好局面。在这大好形势下，我们来纪念今年的“三八”国际劳动妇女节，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以大庆、大寨妇女为榜样，把活学活用毛泽东思想放在一切工作的首位，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的指针。现在，在我国已经形成了一个空前广泛的自觉的学习毛主席著作的群众运动。广大的工农妇女和其他革命的妇女群众，她们怀着深厚的阶级感情，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，积极投入阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的三大革命运动。在各条战线上，已经出现了很多活学活用毛主席著作的先进妇女。毛泽东思想已经成为推动全国妇女自觉革命、彻底革命的强大动力。
    大庆妇女和大寨妇女就是全国妇女中活学活用毛泽东思想的两面鲜明旗帜。她们在党的领导下，以毛泽东思想为武器，以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，坚持社会主义方向，兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想，立场坚定，爱憎分明，不断革命，彻底革命。她们高举社会主义建设总路线的红旗，坚持自力更生，奋发图强，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国的方针，努力学习文化科学知识，提高劳动技能，以穷干、苦干、巧干、实干的革命精神，凭自己的双手，艰苦创业，敢于攀登科学高峰，在生产劳动中充分发挥了妇女“半边天”的作用。她们把勤俭持家和勤俭建国密切联系起来，坚持艰苦朴素的优良传统，发扬了一粒米、一寸布、一厘钱的节约精神。她们在三大革命的实践中，练红了思想，练出了一身过硬本领，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，为建设社会主义的新农村、社会主义的新企业贡献了巨大力量，为妇女的彻底解放开辟了宽广的道路，为全国妇女的革命化树立了光辉的榜样。
    我们全国妇女，都要努力学习大庆、大寨妇女革命化的光辉榜样，学习雷锋、王杰、麦贤得同志一心为革命的精神。最根本的是要学习他们突出政治，坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，把毛主席的指示作为自己思想行动的最高准则，落实到三大革命斗争中去。更加自觉地积极参加城乡社会主义教育运动，积极投入工农业生产的新高潮，并且要时刻关心国际范围内阶级斗争形势的发展。特别值得我们高度警惕的是，当我们在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各条战线上，不断取得伟大胜利的时候，美帝国主义正在加紧扩大侵略越南的战争，而且策划把战争强加在中国人民头上。现代修正主义者更加卑鄙无耻地为美帝国主义效劳，从而加剧了美帝国主义扩大侵略和战争的危险。我们必须加强和社会主义各国妇女群众的团结，加强和世界各国劳动妇女的团结，坚决反对全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义；必须坚决支援站在反美斗争最前线的越南人民；必须加强战备观念，随时准备迎击和粉碎胆敢向我国进攻的美国侵略者。我们在反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的同时，必须把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    全国妇女们！让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在党的领导下，在各自的岗位上，加倍努力，为实现第三个五年计划、为援越抗美、为支援世界人民的革命斗争，作出新的更大的贡献。　　　中华人民共和国全国妇女联合会
