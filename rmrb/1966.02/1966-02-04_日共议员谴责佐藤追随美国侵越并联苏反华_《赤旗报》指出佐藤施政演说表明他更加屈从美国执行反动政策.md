    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 3rd: Japanese Communist Party Diet member Hyakuro Hayashi criticized the Sato Cabinet in a plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 2nd for intensifying its service to the US aggression against Vietnam.

    Hayashi pointed out that the US resumption of bombing North Vietnam, the addition of military spending for Vietnam, and the establishment of permanent military bases in South Vietnam and Thailand "clearly prove that the US is attempting to expand the war. These facts also confirm the deceptive nature of the 'peace proposals' played by the US."

    Hayashi then questioned Sato, saying, "With all these facts before you, does the Prime Minister still insist that the US is sincerely seeking peace?"

    Hayashi strongly protested Sato's order for the Japanese ambassador to the United Nations to support the US use of the UN to justify its aggression against Vietnam.

    Hayashi pointed out that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the Vietnam issue.

    Hayashi listed facts to show that Japan is strengthening its military facilities as a forward base for the US war of aggression against Vietnam. Japan is manufacturing and transporting large quantities of military supplies for the US military, moving US field hospitals to Japan, repairing US fighter jets and bombers, and even providing the US aggressors with the blood of the Japanese people.

    Hayashi pointed out, "Sato has no right to talk about peace while touting the 'US-Japan Security Treaty,' such an aggressive military alliance."

    Hayashi emphasized that Sato's boasting of "Japan-Soviet rapprochement" is nothing more than part of the "US-Soviet cooperation" policy aimed at strengthening the US "containment of China" conspiracy, and it has nothing to do with genuine peaceful coexistence.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 31st: The Japanese Communist Party's *Akahata* published an editorial on the 30th, pointing out that the policy address delivered by Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato in the Diet shows that the Sato government will be even more subservient to US imperialism and implement anti-national and anti-people policies.

    The editorial mentioned the Sato government's support for the US aggression against Vietnam. It pointed out: Sato shamelessly defended the US, saying that the US is seeking "peace" and that the responsibility for hindering the resolution of the Vietnam issue lies with the "Vietnamese people," serving the two-faced policy pursued by the Johnson administration. The editorial condemned Sato's fallacy that the "US-Japan Security Treaty system" is the "fundamental policy for maintaining Japan's peace and security."

    The editorial pointed out that the Sato government's recent approach to the Soviet Union aims to participate in US-Soviet collusion and use the disunity of the socialist camp to strengthen the US imperialist aggressive system of "containing" China.

    日共议员谴责佐藤追随美国侵越并联苏反华
    《赤旗报》指出佐藤施政演说表明他更加屈从美国执行反动政策
    新华社三日讯　东京消息：日本共产党国会议员林百郎二日在众议院全体会议上指责佐藤内阁加紧为美国侵略越南效劳。
    林百郎指出，美国恢复轰炸越南北方、追加用于越南的军费以及在南越和泰国建立永久性军事基地，“这些事实清楚地证明，美国企图扩大战争。这些事实还证实了美国所玩弄的‘和平建议’的欺骗性。”
    林百郎接着质问佐藤说：“这一切事实摆在你们面前，难道首相仍然坚持认为，美国在真心谋求和平吗？”
    林百郎强烈抗议佐藤命令日本驻联合国使节支持美国利用联合国来为美国侵略越南的行动辩解。
    林百郎指出，联合国没有任何权利干涉越南问题。
    林百郎列举事实，说明日本正在加强军事设施，作为美国侵略越南战争的前沿基地，日本为美军大量制造和运输军用物资，把美国的野战医院搬到日本来，为美军修理战斗机和轰炸机，甚至向美国侵略者提供日本人民的鲜血。
    林百郎指出，“佐藤在吹捧‘日美安全条约’这样一个侵略性军事联盟的时候，无权谈论和平问题。”
    林百郎强调指出，佐藤吹嘘“日苏接近”，这不过是目的在于加强美国“遏制中国”阴谋的“美苏合作”政策的一部分，它与真正的和平共处毫不相干。
    新华社三十一日讯　东京消息：日共《赤旗报》三十日发表社论指出，日本首相佐藤荣作在国会上发表的施政演说表明，佐藤政府将更加屈从美帝国主义，执行反民族和反人民的政策。
    社论谈到佐藤政府支持美国侵略越南。它指出：佐藤无耻地替美国辩解，说什么美国在寻求“和平”，阻挠解决越南问题的责任在于“越南人民”，为约翰逊政府推行的两面政策效劳。社论谴责了佐藤所说的“日美安全条约体系”是“维护日本和平和安全的根本政策”的谬论。
    社论指出，佐藤政府最近接近苏联的目的是妄图参与美苏勾结和利用社会主义阵营的不团结，来加强美帝国主义“遏制”中国的侵略体系。
