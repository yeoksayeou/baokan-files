    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued a notice calling on all Party members and cadres in the province to learn from Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit of wholeheartedly serving the revolution and the people. The full text of the notice is as follows:
    Comrade Jiao Yulu, the former Secretary of the Lankao County Party Committee, in leading the people of Lankao in the great struggle against the three major natural disasters of waterlogging, wind, and sand, and salinity, fought tenaciously with a high degree of revolutionary spirit, enduring the torment of serious illness, fearing neither hardship nor death, wholeheartedly serving the revolution and the people, and finally dedicating his life. Comrade Jiao Yulu is worthy of being a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong, a good cadre of the Party, a good son of the people, and a good example of a county Party committee secretary.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was a revolutionary fighter nurtured and armed with Mao Zedong Thought. He often studied and applied Chairman Mao's works creatively with deep class feelings, treating Chairman Mao's books as the supreme instructions for all work. His every word and deed were based on Mao Zedong Thought as the criterion for transforming his thinking and guiding his work.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu established a firm proletarian world view of wholeheartedly serving the people, filled with the spirit of thorough revolution. In revolutionary struggles, he showed everywhere the noble qualities of being loyal to the revolution and diligently serving the people. In his mind, there were only the two words "the people." For the sake of the people, he could endure great hardship and heavy labor, could "climb mountains of knives and plunge into seas of fire," and would not hesitate to sacrifice his life.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was a brave and wise revolutionary vanguard, good at combining soaring revolutionary vigor with a pragmatic and realistic scientific attitude. In the struggle to transform heaven and earth, he carried forward the revolutionary spirit of hard bones and the Party's glorious tradition of investigation and research, going deep among the masses, deep into reality, daring to struggle, daring to win, and in the most difficult times, leading the people of the whole county to blaze a trail of self-reliance, striving for progress, and changing the face of the disaster area.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was an excellent leading cadre, a good "squad leader." He maintained the true qualities of the working people, was simple and unpretentious, set an example, and maintained close ties with the masses. He was good at listening to different opinions from all sides, uniting comrades to work together, and giving play to the initiative of each leading member, so that the county Party committee formed a strong leading core with unified thinking and unified action. He adhered to the working style of the mass line, treating the creations and experiences of the masses with wholehearted enthusiasm, grasping typical examples, setting up banners, inspiring the masses, and advancing victoriously.
    The Provincial Committee calls on all Party members and cadres in the province to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, to learn from his spirit of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to learn from his world view of wholeheartedly serving the people, to learn from his noble qualities of serving the revolution and the people, to learn from his fearless revolutionary spirit and pragmatic and realistic scientific attitude, and to learn from his working style of the mass line and revolutionary working methods. Party committees at all levels, especially county Party committees, in the movement to study Chairman Mao's works extensively, should take Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror, closely combine with the current situation and tasks, examine their own thinking, examine their work, find out the gaps, establish lofty ambitions, and make great aspirations to achieve ideological revolutionization and leadership revolutionization, and strive to completely change the face of Henan.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th. The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued on the 8th to all municipal, prefectural, and county Party committees in the province and to the Party committees and Party groups of the directly subordinate organs of the province, a "Notice on Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu."
    The notice said that learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong, is a major event in further deepening the creative study and application of Mao Zedong Thought at present. The Provincial Committee hopes that Party committees at all levels above the commune level in the province will immediately organize Party committee members and leading cadres in all walks of life to conscientiously study the articles about Comrade Jiao Yulu, especially requiring comrades of county Party committees to be sure to squeeze out time to concentrate and seriously discuss it once. Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu's spirit of conscientiously studying Mao Zedong Thought, serving the people completely and thoroughly, and carrying out the proletarian revolution thoroughly, as well as his fine style of hard work and simplicity, close ties with the masses, and in-depth investigation and research. Use Comrade Jiao Yulu's immortal deeds and revolutionary spirit to compare and examine our thinking, style, and work, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and combine with the current tasks to uncover problems, find out the gaps, and propose improvement measures.

    新华社郑州八日电　中共河南省委发出通知，号召全省党员和干部学习焦裕禄一心为革命、一心为人民的革命精神。通知全文如下：
    兰考县前任县委书记焦裕禄同志，在领导兰考人民向水涝、风沙、盐碱三大自然灾害的伟大斗争中，以高度的革命精神，忍受着严重疾病的折磨，顽强奋战，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民，最后献出了自己的生命。焦裕禄同志不愧为毛泽东同志的好学生，党的好干部，人民的好儿子，县委书记的好榜样。
    焦裕禄同志是用毛泽东思想抚育和武装起来的革命战士。他经常带着深厚的阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的书当作一切工作的最高指示。他的一言一行，都以毛泽东思想为准则，改造思想，指导工作。
    焦裕禄同志树立了坚定的全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级世界观，充满着彻底革命的精神。他在革命斗争中，处处表现了忠心耿耿为革命、勤勤恳恳为人民的高贵品质。在他的心目中只有“人民”二字，为了人民，可以吃大苦、耐大劳，可以“上刀山，下火海”，即使牺牲生命也在所不惜。
    焦裕禄同志是一个有勇有智的革命闯将，善于把冲天的革命干劲和实事求是的科学态度结合起来。他在改天换地的斗争中，发扬了革命的硬骨头精神，发扬了党的调查研究的光荣传统，深入群众，深入实际，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，在最困难的时期，领导全县人民闯出了一条自力更生，奋发图强，改变灾区面貌的道路。
    焦裕禄同志是一个优秀的领导干部，是一个好“班长”。他保持了劳动人民的本色，艰苦朴素，以身作则，密切联系群众。善于听取各方面不同意见，团结同志一道工作，发挥各个领导成员的积极性，使县委形成一个思想齐、动作齐的坚强的领导核心。他坚持群众路线的工作作风，满腔热情地对待群众的创造和经验，抓典型，树旗帜，鼓舞群众，胜利前进。
    省委号召全省党员和干部，都要以焦裕禄同志为榜样，学习他活学活用毛主席著作的精神，学习他全心全意为人民服务的世界观，学习他为革命为人民的高贵品质，学习他大无畏的革命气概和实事求是的科学态度，学习他群众路线的作风和革命的工作方法。各级党委，特别是县委，在大学毛主席著作的运动中，要以焦裕禄同志作为一面镜子，紧密结合当前形势和任务，检查自己思想，检查工作，找出差距，树雄心，立壮志，实现思想革命化和领导革命化，为彻底改变河南的面貌而奋斗。
    新华社沈阳八日电　中共辽宁省委八日向全省各市、地、县委和省直属机关各党委、党组发出“关于向焦裕禄同志学习的通知”。
    通知中说，向毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志学习，是当前进一步深入开展活学活用毛泽东思想的一件大事。省委希望全省公社以上的各级党委，立即组织党委成员和各行各业的领导干部，认真学习有关焦裕禄同志的文章，尤其要求各县县委同志，务必挤时间集中起来，认真讨论一次。学习焦裕禄同志那种认真学习毛泽东思想，完全地彻底地为人民服务和无产阶级的彻底革命的精神，以及他艰苦朴素、密切联系群众、深入调查研究的优良作风。用焦裕禄同志的不朽事迹和革命精神，对照检查我们的思想、作风和工作，开展批评和自我批评，并结合当前各项工作，揭盖子、找差距，提出改进办法。
