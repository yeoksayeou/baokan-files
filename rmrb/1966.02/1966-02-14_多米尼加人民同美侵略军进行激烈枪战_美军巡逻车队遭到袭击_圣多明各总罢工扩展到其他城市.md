    (Xinhua News Agency, Santo Domingo, February 13th) Dauntless patriots in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, once again engaged in multiple gunfights with U.S. aggressor troops on the evening of February 12th, resisting the bloody suppression of the people by the U.S. aggressor troops and the Dominican reactionary military police. According to reports, a paratrooper from the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division was shot in the stomach and seriously wounded during the exchange of fire.

    This battle occurred on the fourth night of a new wave of anti-U.S. resistance launched by the Dominican people. It is reported that patriotic snipers, in the darkness of the night, not only fired on the outposts of the U.S. military and reactionary military police, but also attacked a U.S. military jeep patrol.

    Reports indicate that intense gun battles also took place in Santo Domingo on the evening of February 11th and the daytime of February 12th.

    While patriotic residents continue to wage tit-for-tat struggles against the U.S. aggressor troops and reactionary military police, the general strike that began on the evening of February 9th is expanding to more cities.

    Workers in Puerto Plata and Santiago have also decided to go on strike. In Santo Domingo, the strike has brought at least 80 percent of businesses to a standstill, and the city center is almost deserted. An Associated Press report on February 12th also admitted that the strike appears to be developing into the "most serious threat" to the U.S.-backed "provisional government."

    多米尼加人民同美侵略军进行激烈枪战
    美军巡逻车队遭到袭击　圣多明各总罢工扩展到其他城市
    据新华社十三日讯　圣多明各消息：不畏强暴的多米尼加首都圣多明各爱国者十二日晚上再次同美国侵略军发生多起枪战，反抗美国侵略军和多米尼加反动军警对人民的血腥镇压。据报道，在交火中，美国第八十二空降师的一名伞兵被打穿肚子受了重伤。
    这是多米尼加人民掀起的反美的新浪潮进入第四个晚上的时候发生的战斗。据报道，爱国狙击手们在黑夜中除了对美军和反动军警的岗哨开火以外，还袭击了美军的一个吉普车巡逻队。
    报道说，十一日晚上和十二日白天在圣多明各市内也发生了激烈的枪战。
    在爱国居民对美国侵略军和反动军警继续进行以牙还牙的斗争的同时，九日晚上开始的总罢工正在扩展到更多的城市。
    普拉塔港和圣地亚哥两地的工人也已经决定举行罢工。在圣多明各，罢工至少已经使各行各业百分之八十的业务陷于停顿，市中心区几乎空无一人。美联社十二日一则消息也承认，这次罢工看来正在发展成为对美国扶植的“临时政府”的“最严重的威胁”。
