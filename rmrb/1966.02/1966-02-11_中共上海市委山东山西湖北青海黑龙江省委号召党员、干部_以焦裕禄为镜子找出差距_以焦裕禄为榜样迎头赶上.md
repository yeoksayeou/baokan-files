    Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC and the Provincial Committees of Shandong, Shanxi, Hubei, Qinghai, and Heilongjiang have issued notices calling on Party members and cadres to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    The notices stated that Comrade Jiao Yulu, the former Secretary of the Lankao County Party Committee in Henan Province, was a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong, a good example for county Party secretaries and the vast number of cadres, a model of serving the people wholeheartedly and completely, and a model of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Party members and cadres, especially leading cadres, should conscientiously study Comrade Jiao Yulu's thorough revolutionary spirit and noble communist qualities, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works like Comrade Jiao Yulu, be forever loyal to the people and the Party, and be good students of Chairman Mao.
    The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC said in its notice on the 9th that all Party members and cadres in the city, especially leading cadres, should conscientiously study Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds and the People's Daily editorial, take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely link with the current situation and tasks, compare with their own thinking and work, conscientiously find shortcomings, and strive to realize ideological revolutionization and work revolutionization, so as to better unite and lead the masses of people in the city to strive for the in-depth development of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and for further winning new victories in China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    The Shandong Provincial Committee of the CPC's notice requires all departments directly under the province, all local (city) committees, county committees, and commune Party committees, all factories and mining enterprises, and all units that are holding cadre meetings to spend some time organizing cadres to conscientiously study the communications on Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds and the People's Daily editorial, as well as other relevant materials. Other units should be led by the leaders themselves to preside over the study, seriously discuss, and all should link with the situation of their own region and unit, take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example, check themselves against it, find out the gaps, and formulate measures to further study Chairman Mao's works, promote the ideological revolutionization of people and the revolutionization of leading organs, and struggle to completely change the natural appearance of Shandong Province and better complete the Party's various tasks.
    The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC's notice pointed out that learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu and carrying forward Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit not only has important practical significance for the current anti-drought struggle, but also has far-reaching significance for fundamentally changing the natural appearance of Shanxi Province. Party organizations at all levels should quickly organize all Party members and cadres, especially county Party secretaries and responsible Party cadres above the county level, to study conscientiously; and closely combine this study with highlighting politics, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the anti-drought struggle.
    The Hubei Provincial Committee of the CPC's notice said that learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu should be combined with the current activities of studying Chairman Mao's works and implementing the "Provincial Party Committee's instructions on 'politics commanding the economy, business, and technology'," and should quickly set off a new upsurge in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. To realize the revolutionization of work and ideological revolutionization, closely combine with the current situation and tasks, compare with their own thinking and work, find out the gaps, straighten out the relationship between politics and business, further highlight politics, establish lofty ambitions, and promote the in-depth development of the three great revolutionary movements, to further change the face of Hubei and strive to realize the Third Five-Year Plan.
    The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the CPC's notice said that when we learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, we must link with reality and use Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to check ourselves, to see if we are creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought like Comrade Jiao Yulu, and if we are serving the people wholeheartedly like Comrade Jiao Yulu. The Provincial Committee hopes that all cadres of all ethnic groups in the province, especially county Party secretaries and leading cadres in all walks of life, will, through learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu, improve their thinking and work, accelerate the realization of ideological revolutionization, and produce a group of Jiao Yulu-style leading cadres.
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the CPC's notice requires leading cadres at all levels above the county level to link their own thinking and work in their study, conduct self-examination, further promote the revolutionization of their thinking and work, and greatly promote the movement of leading cadres above the county level to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works.
