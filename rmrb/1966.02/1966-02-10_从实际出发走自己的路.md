    The steel industry workers of our country, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, breaking down superstitions, emancipating their minds, refusing to be "Jia Gui-style" characters, resolutely thinking independently, resolutely breaking down the thought of mechanically copying foreign "templates," have forged a new path for developing the steel industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This is to proceed from the actual conditions of our country, make full use of our country's resources, use ordinary steelmaking equipment and steelmaking methods, and develop ordinary low-alloy steel to gradually replace and supplement those carbon steels that are of poor quality, short service life, and unsuitable for modern requirements.

    Proceeding from actual conditions is the most basic working method that Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly asked us to firmly remember. In the struggle for production and scientific experiments, proceeding from actual conditions means determining our guidelines and tasks based on the actual needs of our country, the actual human resources, the actual technical conditions, and the actual resources.

    In developing industry, whether to proceed from the actual resource situation of our country or from the actual resource situation of other countries is a fundamental question. We are a socialist country, and we cannot, like imperialist countries, rely on plundering the resources of other countries to develop industry, nor can we, like some colonial and semi-colonial countries, rely on imported raw materials to develop industry. In order to realize the modernization of our country's agriculture, industry, science and technology, and national defense, and in order to better support the revolution of the world's people, we need to establish an independent and complete industrial system. This independent and complete industrial system not only requires the ability to manufacture the various products we need, but also requires raw materials to be based domestically, proceeding from the actual resource situation of our country. The reason why developing ordinary low-alloy steel has become a path to develop China's steel industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is because it is based on China's resource base, and at the same time, the production method is relatively simple. Taking this path, our prospects will be very broad. If raw materials depend on others, you will have as much as they give, and if they don't give, you will have nothing. In this situation, even if you have very sophisticated equipment and technology, it is like water without a source, or a tree without roots. You can't increase production as much as you want, and you can't speed it up as much as you want. What independent and complete industrial system is that? Where can you achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results?

    When it comes to using our country's unique resources to develop our own products, some comrades always feel that there is insufficient basis and are afraid of this and that. The so-called "insufficient basis" refers to the fact that no basis can be found in books, especially foreign books. In fact, all scientific theories come from practice. Since foreigners have no practice in utilizing China's unique resources, of course they have no scientific theory in this regard. Why can't we enrich and develop the scientific theories of our predecessors through our own practice?

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Discover truth through practice, and then confirm and develop truth through practice." We must study the scientific and technological theories of our predecessors, whether Chinese or foreign, but we must combine them with the actual resource situation of our country and learn those things that are suitable for our country's situation. If it is not suitable, we must proceed from reality and create our own scientific and technological theories.

    Our country is vast and rich in resources, and there are still many resources that have not been fully utilized. In industrial production, there are many areas where we need to exert our strength and advance. As long as we grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought, proceed from reality, combine revolutionary spirit with scientific spirit, and, under the leadership of the Party, closely rely on the masses, we will surely be able to forge our own path in more areas.

    从实际出发走自己的路
    我国钢铁工业职工，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，破除迷信，解放思想，不做“贾桂式”的人物，坚决独立思考，坚决破除照抄外国“洋框框”的思想，闯出了一条多快好省地发展钢铁工业的新道路。这就是从我国的实际情况出发，充分利用我国资源，利用普通的炼钢设备和炼钢方法，发展普通低合金钢，以逐步代替和补充那些质量差、使用寿命短、不适合现代化要求的炭素钢。
    从实际情况出发，这是毛泽东同志一再要求我们必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法。在生产斗争和科学实验中，从实际情况出发，就是根据我国需要的实际、人力的实际、技术条件的实际，以及资源的实际，来确定我们的方针和任务。
    在发展工业的时候，是从我国资源的实际情况出发，还是从别国资源的实际情况出发，这是一个带有根本性的问题。我们是社会主义国家，既不能象帝国主义国家那样，靠掠夺别国的资源来发展工业，也不能象一些殖民地半殖民地国家那样，依赖进口的原材料来发展工业。为了实现我国农业、工业、科学技术和国防的现代化，为了更好地支援世界人民的革命，我们需要建立一个独立的、完整的工业体系。这个独立的、完整的工业体系，不但要求能够制造我们所需要的各种产品，而且要求原料、材料也立足于国内，从我国资源的实际情况出发。发展普通低合金钢之所以成为一条多快好省地发展我国钢铁工业的道路，就是因为它是立足于我国资源基础上的，同时生产方法比较简便。走这一条道路，我们的天地就非常广阔。如果原材料仰给于人，人家给多少，你就有多少，人家不给，你就什么也没有。在这种情况下，即使有很高明的设备和技术，也是无源之水，无本之木，要多不能多，要快不能快。那还有什么独立的完整的工业体系呢？还有什么多快好省呢？
    一提到利用我国特有的资源来发展我们自己的产品，有的同志总觉得根据不足，怕这怕那。所谓“根据不足”，指的是书本上，特别是外国书本上找不到根据。其实一切科学的理论都来自实践。外国人既然没有利用我国特有资源的实践，当然就没有这方面的科学理论。我们为什么不可以通过自己的实践来充实和发展前人的科学理论呢？
    毛泽东同志说：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理。”前人的科学技术理论，不管是中国的还是外国的，我们都要学习，但一定要同我国资源的实际情况结合起来，学那些和我国情况相适合的东西。如果不适合，我们就要从实际出发，创造自己的科学技术理论。
    我国地大物博，还有很多资源没有被充分利用。在工业生产上，需要我们发挥力量和进军的地方多得很。我们只要掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，从实际出发，把革命精神和科学精神结合起来，在党的领导下，紧紧依靠群众，就一定能够在更多的方面闯出自己的道路来。
