    The era of workers, peasants and soldiers mastering theory has begun
    *Hongqi* Magazine Commentator

    An unprecedented mass movement of studying theory is unfolding widely and deeply across the country. This is the movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers consciously studying Comrade Mao Zedong’s works. The effects of this study prove that the workers, peasants, and soldiers can not only understand Marxism-Leninism theory but also learn it very well and are very good at applying it.

    We see that the fundamental question of the proletarian world outlook—devotion to revolution, everything for revolution, and wholehearted service to the people—has been grasped by more and more people and has become the guiding principle for their actions.

    We see that the fundamental viewpoint of dialectical materialism epistemology—that correct ideas come from social practice, that matter can transform into spirit, and that spirit can transform into matter—has become increasingly familiar to workers, peasants, and soldiers, and they are creating infinite material wealth under the guidance of this viewpoint.

    We see that “one divides into two,” that is, the law of the unity of opposites, the core issue of materialist dialectics, is no longer a strange concept to workers, peasants, and soldiers, and everyone is widely applying it in practical life.

    Marx said: “Theory becomes a material force as soon as it has gripped the masses.”① He also said: “Philosophy is the material weapon of the proletariat, and the proletariat is the spiritual weapon of philosophy.”② In today’s China, theory has gripped the masses, and the masses have mastered theory, transforming into a tremendous material force. Mao Zedong Thought has become the most powerful spiritual weapon in the hands of the masses.

    Workers, peasants, and soldiers, having grasped Mao Zedong Thought and raised their consciousness, understand that they work for the revolution, farm for the revolution, and train and fight for the revolution. They consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to find the laws in their work, and they become even better at working, farming, and training and fighting. People in all walks of life who have grasped Mao Zedong Thought understand that they work for the revolution, and they become even better at working. The workers, peasants, and soldiers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are constantly making inventions and creations in the great struggle to transform nature and society.

    Throughout the long history of mankind, the broad masses of working people have been locked out of the gate of theoretical knowledge. Whenever theory was mentioned, people would think it was only the business of intellectuals. Although the proletariat has long had its own intellectuals, they are still a minority after all. In today’s China, the situation has undergone earth-shaking changes. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have broken open the door of theoretical knowledge and begun to master the theories of philosophy, social sciences, and also natural sciences. From then on, theory began to be liberated from classrooms and research rooms, the situation where a few intellectuals monopolized theory was broken, and a new historical era of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering theory began.

    The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering theory has immeasurable significance. As time goes by, this great significance will inevitably become increasingly apparent.

    However, just as the emergence of all new things will encounter resistance from old forces and must go through struggle, not everyone agrees with workers, peasants, and soldiers learning theory, and there is also struggle. Some people stubbornly adhere to their bourgeois viewpoints, and in all aspects, they do not believe in the masses, look down on the masses, and do not believe that workers, peasants, and soldiers can learn theory. A few years ago, when the high tide of the masses learning theory had already risen, some people attacked this new thing, saying that the masses learning theory was “instant emotion and discussing things as they are,” “learning in a fragmentary way,” “unsystematic,” destroying the “complete system” of theory, and even slandering it as an “evil wind,” a “strange thing,” providing “rich negative teaching material” for theoretical work. Because workers, peasants, and soldiers began to learn and apply philosophy, these bourgeois “philosophers” who attempted to monopolize philosophical theory said that doing theoretical work themselves was a “unlucky” profession and felt “most humiliated.” Over the past few years, workers, peasants, and soldiers have learned theory, adopting methods of learning and applying it flexibly, combining learning with application, and learning what is urgently needed first, achieving immediate and significant achievements, and most powerfully answering those groundless fallacies.

    The people are the masters of history. Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is right and normal for them to master the theory of understanding and transforming the world; it is the inevitable trend of historical development and is independent of human will. Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, scientifically reflects the interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of the people, and it is what the masses should understand and can understand. A poor peasant woman in Jiangsu Province, studying Chairman Mao’s works with everyone, said when some people were afraid she would not understand: “Chairman Mao’s words are addressed to us poor and lower-middle peasants, not to landlords and rich peasants. Why wouldn’t I understand?” This kind of self-evident thing was impossible to realize among the broad masses in the old era; it can only be realized under our socialist system, in the Mao Zedong era.

    In 1895, Lenin once said that the Czarist ministers were very afraid of the theories of Marx and Engels. The ministers saw the workers as gunpowder and knowledge and education as sparks; the ministers were convinced that once the spark fell on the gunpowder, the first to be blown up would be the Czarist government. Lenin said: “Workers! See how afraid our ministers are of the combination of knowledge and workers! You should show everyone that no force can stop the awakening of the workers! Without knowledge, workers cannot defend themselves; with knowledge, they have power!”③

    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: Despotism benefits from the ignorance of the people, while we benefit from the intelligence of the people. We want to enable all people to gradually leave the state of ignorance.

    Those who are afraid of the combination of knowledge and workers, afraid of the awakening of the workers, afraid of the workers having power, those who oppose the people breaking away from ignorance, and oppose the people being the masters of history, will of course think that the masses learning theory is a “strange thing.” When workers, peasants, and soldiers master theory, they can more consciously control their own destiny and the destiny of the country, making it difficult for those who want to use book knowledge as capital to peddle their bourgeois world outlook and attempt to transform the world with the bourgeois world outlook to achieve their goals. They will of course feel the most “unlucky” and “most humiliated.”

    For the masses to learn theory and master theory, we think it is normal, it is a positive wind, it is positive teaching material, while bourgeois theorists think it is “strange,” it is an “evil wind,” it is “negative teaching material.” This is the struggle between the proletarian world outlook and the bourgeois world outlook, the struggle between socialist thought and anti-socialist thought, the class struggle on the theoretical front. We must see the nature of this issue and its importance, consciously carry out this struggle, in order to do a better job of this major event of the masses learning theory, to better combine the theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, so that the masses are more intelligent and more powerful.

    Workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering the theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and mastering Mao Zedong Thought will generate infinite power. This is the most important guarantee for achieving victory in revolution and construction, and it is also the most important guarantee for preventing the emergence of revisionism and preventing the restoration of capitalism. In the face of the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the class enemies at home and abroad, all kinds of monsters and demons, will be smashed to pieces. Workers, peasants, and soldiers flexibly learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the most important basic construction in the political and ideological aspect of our country, a major matter related to the destiny of our country, a major matter related to the proletarian revolutionary cause, a long-term plan for thousands of years, a plan for ten thousand years.

    The high tide of workers, peasants, and soldiers flexibly learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought will have a great promoting effect on the learning of the broad masses of cadres. Cadres, especially leading cadres, must walk in front of the masses in all mass movements, and must first walk in front of the masses in learning Mao Zedong Thought. Learning Mao Zedong Thought is the most important content of cadre education, and it is also the most important content of Party building. Only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought can we powerfully carry out the struggle against modern revisionism and all bourgeois trends of thought, can we powerfully carry out class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation, can we guarantee the correct implementation of the Party's guidelines and policies, and can we educate the masses and guide the masses to continuously improve and continuously advance in the correct direction. Not seriously studying Comrade Mao Zedong’s works will cause us to fall behind ideologically and fall behind in our work. Not mastering Mao Zedong Thought means losing the most basic conditions for leading the masses forward. It is very dangerous not to be aware of this point. If there are situations where cadres do not learn as well as the masses, and leading cadres do not learn as well as general cadres, then this should be quickly changed.

    Workers, peasants, and soldiers learn theory so well is inseparable from their adopting the method of learning and applying it flexibly. We must learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and learn their method of learning and applying it flexibly.

    The method of learning and applying it flexibly is what Comrade Mao Zedong has always advocated, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers use it very well. They learn with questions in mind, learn and then use, learn while using. They use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze practical problems and solve practical problems, not only doing their work well and achieving the effectiveness of transforming the objective world, but also improving their thinking and achieving the effectiveness of transforming the subjective world. Many good articles by workers, peasants, and soldiers are written on this basis. These articles are lively and rich in content, using the language of the masses to clearly explain philosophical principles through concrete struggle life. Such articles are enjoyable to read, and reading them is very useful. Some people may not admit that these articles are philosophical articles or theoretical articles. We say, no. Such articles are very good philosophical articles and theoretical articles. Because it comes from social practice, from the three social practices of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation, and is used to guide social practice.

    There is also another method, which is to learn by rote without using. Those who learn by rote without using, lock themselves in a room and mechanically cram books, mechanically delve into concepts, do not contact the masses, do not contact reality, do not analyze practical problems, and do not solve practical problems. The result of this kind of learning is still only from book to book, from concept to concept, able to speak and write, but unable to use, speaking seems to be coherent, but is at a loss when encountering actual struggles, unable to distinguish right from wrong. This kind of learning is of no use. The articles written by such people are full of intellectual tones and have no practical content. Such articles, few people can understand them; even if they understand them, they are of no use, because it cannot help people understand the world and transform the world.

    Those who specialize in theoretical work such as philosophy and economics need to have a revolution, come out of their studies, go to factories, go to the countryside, go to the companies, go to the shops, contact the masses, go deep into reality, and transform their thinking. Only by going deep into reality, studying the philosophy and economics in practical life, summing up practical experience and raising it to theory, and being able to answer new problems that arise in the real struggle, is such theoretical work useful. In this way, we can write good articles on flexibly learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

    Mao Zedong Thought is our supreme instruction for carrying out revolution and construction. As long as we adopt the method of learning and applying it flexibly, work hard on the word "use," and use Mao Zedong Thought to take command in all our work, we will be invincible.

    工农兵群众掌握理论的时代开始了
    《红旗》杂志评论员
    一个前所未有的群众学习理论的运动，正在全国广泛深入地开展着，这就是工农兵群众自觉地大学毛泽东同志著作的运动。学习的效果证明，马克思列宁主义理论，工农兵群众不但能够学懂，而且学得很好，很会运用。
    我们看到，一心为革命，一切为革命，全心全意为人民服务，这个无产阶级世界观的根本问题，已经为越来越多的人所掌握，并且成为他们行动的指针。
    我们看到，正确思想是从社会实践中来的，物质可以变精神，精神又可以变物质，这个辩证唯物主义认识论的根本观点，工农兵群众已经越来越熟悉，并且在这个观点的指导下创造着无穷的物质财富。
    我们看到，“一分为二”，即对立统一规律，这个唯物辩证法的核心问题，在工农兵群众中，已经不是什么陌生的道理，大家正在实际生活中广泛地运用着。
    马克思说：“理论一经掌握群众，就会变成物质力量。”①又说：“哲学把无产阶级当做自己的物质武器，同样地，无产阶级也把哲学当做自己的精神武器”②。在今天的中国，理论掌握了群众，群众掌握了理论，变成了巨大的物质力量。毛泽东思想已经成为群众手中最强有力的精神武器。
    工农兵群众掌握了毛泽东思想，提高了觉悟，就懂得了为革命而做工，为革命而种田，为革命而练兵打仗。他们自觉地运用毛泽东思想，寻找工作中的规律，就更会做工，更会种田，更会练兵打仗了。各行各业的人掌握了毛泽东思想，就懂得了为革命而工作，也就更会工作了。用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众，在改造自然、改造社会的伟大斗争中，不断地有所发明，有所创造。
    在漫长的人类历史上，广大劳动人民一直被关在理论知识的大门之外。一提起理论，人们就会想到这只是知识分子的事情。无产阶级虽然早有了自己的知识分子，但毕竟还是少数。在今天的中国，情况发生了翻天覆地的变化。在党的领导下，广大的工农兵群众，闯开了理论知识的大门，开始掌握哲学、社会科学的理论，也开始掌握自然科学的理论。从此，理论开始从课堂、研究室解放出来了，少数知识分子垄断理论的局面被打破了，工农兵群众掌握理论的新的历史时代开始了。
    广大的工农兵群众掌握理论，具有不可估量的伟大意义。随着时间的推移，这种伟大意义必将越来越明显地表现出来。
    然而，正象一切新事物的出现都会遇到旧势力的阻碍、都要经过斗争一样，工农兵学理论，也并不是每一个人都赞成的，也是有斗争的。有的人，顽固地坚持自己的资产阶级观点，在一切方面都不相信群众，瞧不起群众，也不相信工农兵群众能够学理论。几年以前，当群众学理论的高潮已经兴起的时候，就有人对这一新事物大肆攻击，说群众学理论是什么“即景生情，就事论事”，是“枝枝节节地学”，“不系统”，破坏了理论的“完整的体系”，甚至诬蔑这是“一股邪风”，是“稀奇古怪的事”，给理论工作“提供了丰富的反面教材”。由于工农兵群众开始学哲学、用哲学，这种企图垄断哲学理论的资产阶级“哲学家”就说什么自己做理论工作是“倒霉”的职业，感到“最灰溜溜的”。几年来，工农兵学理论，采取活学活用、学用结合、急用先学的方法，取得了立竿见影的巨大成就，最有力地回答了那些毫无根据的谬论。
    人民群众是历史的主人，在无产阶级专政的条件下，他们掌握认识世界、改造世界的理论，这本来是应当的、正常的，是历史发展的必然趋势，是不以人的意志为转移的。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，科学地反映了无产阶级和广大人民群众的利益，是群众应当懂、也能够懂的。江苏省一位贫农妇女，同大家一起学习毛主席著作，有人怕她听不懂，她说：“毛主席的话是对我们贫下中农说的，又不是对地主富农说的，为什么听不懂？”这种理所当然的事情，在旧时代不可能在广大群众中实现，只有在我们的社会主义制度下，在毛泽东时代，才能实现。
    一八九五年，列宁曾经说过，沙皇大臣先生非常害怕马克思和恩格斯的理论。大臣把工人看成火药，把知识和教育看成火星；大臣确信，火星一旦落到火药上，首先被炸的就是沙皇政府。列宁说：“工人们！你们看，我们的大臣们多么害怕知识和工人的结合！你们应当向所有的人表明：任何力量都不能阻止工人的觉醒！没有知识，工人就无法自卫；有了知识，他们就有了力量！”③
    毛泽东同志曾经指出：专制主义者利于人民愚昧，我们则利于人民聪明，我们要使一切人民都能逐渐地离开愚昧状态。
    那种害怕知识和工人的结合，害怕工人的觉醒，害怕工人有了力量的人，那种反对人民脱离愚昧状态，反对人民作历史的主人的人，当然会认为群众学理论是“稀奇古怪的事”。工农兵群众掌握了理论，就能更加自觉地掌握自己的命运，掌握国家的命运，使那些想用书本知识作本钱，贩卖自己的资产阶级世界观，企图用资产阶级世界观改造世界的人，难以达到自己的目的了，他们当然会感到最“倒霉”，最“灰溜溜的”。
    对于群众学习理论，掌握理论，我们认为是正常的，是正风，是正面教材，资产阶级理论家却认为是“奇怪”的，是“邪风”，是“反面教材”。这是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的斗争，是社会主义思想同反社会主义思想的斗争，是理论战线上的阶级斗争。我们必须看到这个问题的性质和它的重要意义，自觉地进行这种斗争，才能把群众学理论这一件大事做得更好，使马克思列宁主义的理论知识和工农兵群众更好地结合起来，使群众更加聪明，更加有力量。
    工农兵群众掌握了马克思列宁主义的理论知识，掌握了毛泽东思想，就会产生无穷的力量，这是革命和建设取得胜利的最重要保证，也是防止产生修正主义、防止资本主义复辟的最重要保证。在用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众面前，国内国外的阶级敌人，各种各样的牛鬼蛇神，都会碰得粉身碎骨。工农兵群众活学活用毛泽东思想，是我们国家在政治思想方面头等重要的基本建设，是关系到我们国家命运的大事，是关系到无产阶级革命事业的大事，是千年大计，万年大计。
    工农兵群众活学活用毛泽东思想的高潮，对于广大干部的学习，会产生很大的促进作用。干部，特别是领导干部，要在一切群众运动中走在前面，就必须首先在学习毛泽东思想方面走在群众的前面。学习毛泽东思想，是干部教育的最重要内容，也是党的建设的最重要内容。只有掌握了毛泽东思想，才能有力地进行反对现代修正主义和一切资产阶级思潮的斗争，才能有力地进行阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，才能保证党的方针政策的正确贯彻执行，才能教育群众、引导群众朝着正确的方向不断提高、不断前进。不认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，思想上就会掉队，工作上就会掉队。不掌握毛泽东思想，就失掉了领导群众前进的最基本的条件。在这一点上不觉悟，那是很危险的。如果有的地方存在着干部不如群众学得好，领导干部不如一般干部学得好的情况，那就应当迅速改变。
    工农兵学理论所以学得好，同他们采取活学活用的方法是分不开的。我们要向工农兵群众学习，学习他们活学活用的方法。
    活学活用的方法，是毛泽东同志所一贯提倡的，广大工农兵群众运用得很好。他们带着问题学，学了就用，边学边用。他们运用毛泽东思想来分析实际问题、解决实际问题，既做好了工作，收到了改造客观世界的成效，又提高了思想，收到了改造主观世界的成效。工农兵的很多好文章，就是在这个基础上写出来的。这些文章，生动活泼，内容丰富，通过具体的斗争生活，用群众的语言，把哲学道理讲得清清楚楚。这样的文章，使人爱看，看了很有用处。有人可能不承认这些文章是哲学文章、理论文章。我们说，不对。这样的文章是很好的哲学文章、理论文章。因为它是从社会实践中，从阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三项社会实践中产生，又是用来指导社会实践的。
    另外还有一种方法，就是死学不用。死学不用的人，关在房子里死啃书本，死抠概念，不接触群众，不接触实际，不分析实际问题，不解决实际问题。这样学习的结果，还是只会从书本到书本，从概念到概念，会讲、会写，就是不会用，讲起来似乎头头是道，一接触实际斗争就束手无策，分不清是非。这样的学习，是没有什么用处的。这样的人写出来的文章，尽是知识分子腔调，毫无实际内容。这样的文章，很少有人能够看懂；看懂了，也没有什么用处，因为它不能帮助人们认识世界、改造世界。
    专门从事哲学、经济学等等理论工作的人，有必要来一个革命，从书斋里走出来，到工厂去，到农村去，到连队去，到商店去，联系群众，深入实际，改造思想。只有深入实际，研究实际生活中的哲学、经济学，把实践经验加以总结，上升为理论，能够回答现实斗争中出现的新问题，这样的理论工作才是有用处的。这样，也就能够写出活学活用毛泽东思想的好文章了。
    毛泽东思想是我们进行革命和建设的最高指示。只要我们采取活学活用的方法，在“用”字上狠下功夫，在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅，我们就会无往而不胜。
