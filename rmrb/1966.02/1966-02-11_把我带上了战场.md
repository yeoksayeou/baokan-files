    Brought Me to the Battlefield
    Combat Hero Shu Jicheng
    It is indeed not easy for the comrades of the Naval Political Department Drama Troupe to put the heroic deeds of the "August 6th" and "Chongwu" naval battles on the stage in such a short period of time. Although I did not participate in these two naval battles, the scenes on the stage brought me to the battlefield. I was very excited and greatly educated after watching the play. The whole play is permeated with Mao Zedong Thought, reflecting that people, not weapons, determine the outcome of war, and embodying what Vice Chairman Lin said: the greatest combat power is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The sailors on the stage are all like little tigers, full of energy. Everywhere, on the docks, on the gun positions, in the pilot house, you can see quotations from Chairman Mao. Comrades seize the time to study Chairman Mao's works and use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions. The comrades of the 878艇 (878 Boat) actively requested to set sail, and their high morale for combat truly reflected the reality of our troops, especially the scene where the enemy invaded the fishing grounds and the soldiers requested to attack and annihilate the enemy. Although I am not in the naval vessel unit, I have similar experiences to the comrades of the 878 Boat. I remember once I was on combat duty and was temporarily assigned to work in the control tower, and I also had some feelings about it. Of course, the situation of the 878 Boat was not exactly the same as my experience that time, but I received another education after watching the play.
    The play also realistically reflects the soldiers' high degree of vigilance. We were like this when we were on duty in the front. Sometimes, after we fell asleep, we would sit up with a start when we heard the telephone ring, thinking it was the alarm bell.
    In battle, sometimes the enemy's weapons are superior to ours. For example, in the play, the 878 Boat fought a large warship seven or eight times its size. We also had similar situations in air combat. Sometimes, as soon as we approached the enemy aircraft, they panicked and even shot down their own aircraft. This is incomprehensible to those who believe in the "theory that weapons decide everything," but soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, "using one's strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses," are invincible. The victory of the 878 Boat embodies Chairman Mao's great military thinking. Through the activities of the old grandpa, militiamen, and Young Pioneers, the script also highlights the idea of people's war and that everyone is a soldier, realistically reflecting the revolutionary vigilance of the coastal militia. Most of the prisoners in the "August 6th Naval Battle" and on the "Zhangjiang" were captured by the militia. Our air force shot down aircraft, and the prisoners were also captured by the militia. When an American devil parachuted, the militia rushed up with bamboo poles. The prisoners in the last scene of the play are few, but they write about the embarrassing side of the enemy and also their cunning side. In this way, it can educate everyone to be highly vigilant against the enemy.
    Now American imperialism has resumed the bombing of North Vietnam. After watching this play, it has further encouraged my fighting spirit. I want to better arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought, be highly vigilant, and be ready to annihilate all invading enemies at any time.

    把我带上了战场
    战斗英雄　舒积成
    海政文工团话剧团的同志在很短的时间里，把“八·六”、“崇武”海战的英雄事迹搬上了舞台，确实是一件很不容易的事。我没有参加这两次海战，舞台上出现的情景却把我带到了战场。看完戏很激动，受了很大的教育。全剧贯穿了毛主席思想，体现了决定战争胜负的是人不是武器，体现了林副主席所说的最大的战斗力是用毛主席思想武装起来的人。舞台上的水兵们，一个个都象小老虎一样，人人干劲十足，码头上，炮位上，驾驶台，到处都可以看到毛主席语录，同志们抓紧时间学习毛主席著作，以毛主席的思想指导自己的行动。878艇的同志们积极要求出航，高昂的求战情绪等等，都真实地反映了我们部队的现实情况，特别是敌人侵犯渔场，战士们请求出击歼灭敌人那一场。我虽然不是舰艇部队的，但也有类似878艇同志们的体会。记得有一次我战斗值班，临时把我留在塔台工作了，我也有些情绪。当然，878艇的情况和我那次还不完全一样，但我看戏后又受了一次教育。
    剧中反映战士的高度警惕性也真实可信，在前方我们值班时就是这样，有时睡下了，听到电话铃响，呼地一下就坐起来了，以为是电铃响了。
    在战斗中，有时敌人的武器是超过我们的，象剧中878艇就打了比他大七倍八倍的大军舰。我们空战中也有这样的情况，有时我们一靠近敌机，他们就慌了，甚至把他们自己的飞机都打下来了。这在“唯武器论”者来看是不能理解的，但以毛主席思想武装起来的战士，“以己之长攻敌之短”，是战无不胜的。878艇的胜利，体现了毛主席的伟大军事思想。剧本通过老阿公，民兵，少先队员的活动，也突出人民战争，全民皆兵的思想，真实地反映了沿海民兵的革命警惕性。“八·六海战”，“章江”的俘虏大都是民兵抓的；我们空军打了飞机，俘虏也是民兵抓的，有个美国鬼子跳伞时，民兵只拿了竹竿就冲上去了。剧中最后一场的俘虏，戏不多，但写出了敌人狼狈的一面，也写了他们狡猾的一面。这样，能教育大家，对敌人要高度的警惕。
    现在美帝国主义又恢复了对越南北方的轰炸，看了这个戏，更加鼓舞了我的斗志，我要更好的以毛主席思想来武装自己，高度警惕，随时准备歼灭一切来犯的敌人。
