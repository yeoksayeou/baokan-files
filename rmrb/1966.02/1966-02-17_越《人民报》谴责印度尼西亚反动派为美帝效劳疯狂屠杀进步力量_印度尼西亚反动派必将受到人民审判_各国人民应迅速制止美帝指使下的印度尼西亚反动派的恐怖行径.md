    Hanoi, February 15th (Xinhua) – The Vietnamese *People's Daily* published an editorial on February 15th, strongly condemning the Indonesian reactionaries, allies and lackeys of U.S. imperialism, for carrying out frantic terror and massacres against the Indonesian people and patriotic and progressive forces, including the Communist Party.

    The editorial stated that in Indonesia, the Indonesian reactionaries, lackeys of U.S. imperialism, have recently intensified their frantic large-scale terror and massacres against the Indonesian people. Arson, looting, arrests, imprisonment, torture, and killings are being carried out throughout the country, with a level of barbarity surpassing even that of the Middle Ages. Suffering from this frenzied terror are the Indonesian people, including Indonesian communists and other patriotic and progressive elements who have bravely struggled against imperialism and old and new colonialism to defend Indonesia's independence and sovereignty and to strive for democracy and social progress.

    The editorial said that the Indonesian reactionaries claim their actions are aimed at the "September 30th Movement" and that the Indonesian Communist Party is responsible for this "coup." This is nothing more than a despicable excuse to justify their crimes of murdering patriots and other Indonesian people, and to cover up their treacherous conspiracy with U.S. imperialism to undermine the revolutionary cause of the Indonesian people in order to establish a military dictatorship in Indonesia that serves U.S. imperialism.

    The editorial said that the Indonesian reactionaries recently staged another farce of "interrogating" participants in the "September 30th Movement" and members of the Indonesian Communist Party. In fact, it is they who should be on trial, and they will certainly be judged by the Indonesian people. It was the Indonesian reactionaries, acting on the orders of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, who sent troops into Jakarta, formed a "Council of Generals," and plotted a military coup to overthrow President Sukarno's government in order to abolish Indonesia's anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist line and turn Indonesia into a new type of American colony. The September 30th Movement opposed this military coup plot.

    The editorial pointed out that since Indonesia gained independence, the Indonesian reactionaries, lackeys of the United States, have conspired more than once to launch military coups to overthrow President Sukarno. But these conspiracies have been smashed one after another. In the Indonesian reactionaries' successive conspiracies, the role of U.S. imperialist intervention and direction has been fully exposed. This time, in the Indonesian reactionaries' movement against the Indonesian people and Indonesia's patriotic and progressive forces, the United States has once again revealed its true face as the director. Some American newspapers have revealed that the United States provided a large amount of dollars to the Indonesian reactionaries to carry out this terrorist activity. U.S. imperialists and their lackeys have expressed joy and satisfaction with the Indonesian reactionaries' frenzied actions in launching an attack on Indonesia's patriotic and progressive forces.

    The editorial emphasized that it is clear that U.S. imperialism is the culprit in the current serious situation in Indonesia. The United States has played an extremely despicable and dangerous role in the Indonesian events, exposing the international nature of this event. The purpose of these actions by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is not only to oppose the Indonesian people and undermine Indonesia's independence and sovereignty, but also to oppose the people of other countries and undermine the independence of all countries and peace in Asia and the world.

    The editorial concluded by saying that the Vietnamese people call on all people in the world who love independence, democracy, peace, and justice to take swift, effective, and decisive action to support the Indonesian people and oppose the barbaric acts of the Indonesian reactionaries under the direction of the United States, force the Indonesian reactionaries to stop their brutal acts of terror in Indonesia, immediately release all those they have arrested, compensate the victims for their losses, and respect the democratic freedoms of the Indonesian people.

    越《人民报》谴责印度尼西亚反动派为美帝效劳疯狂屠杀进步力量
    印度尼西亚反动派必将受到人民审判
    各国人民应迅速制止美帝指使下的印度尼西亚反动派的恐怖行径
    新华社河内十五日电　越南《人民报》十五日发表社论，强烈谴责美帝国主义的同盟和仆从印度尼西亚反动派对印度尼西亚人民和包括共产党在内的爱国进步力量进行疯狂的恐怖镇压和屠杀。
    社论说，在印度尼西亚，美帝国主义的仆从印度尼西亚反动派最近继续对印度尼西亚人民加紧进行疯狂的大恐怖和大屠杀。全国各地都在进行烧掠、逮捕、监禁、酷刑和屠杀，其野蛮程度甚至超过了中世纪。受这种疯狂的恐怖迫害的是印度尼西亚人民，其中包括为保卫印度尼西亚独立和主权、争取民主和社会进步而对帝国主义和新老殖民主义作英勇斗争的印度尼西亚共产党人和其他爱国进步分子。
    社论说，印度尼西亚反动派说什么他们的行动是针对着“九月三十日运动”的，说什么印度尼西亚共产党要对这次“政变”负责。这只不过是一个卑鄙的借口，用来为他们杀害爱国者和其他印度尼西亚人民的罪行辩护，并用来掩盖他们伙同美帝国主义破坏印度尼西亚人民革命事业的奸险的阴谋，以便在印度尼西亚建立一个为美帝国主义效劳的军阀独裁政权。
    社论说，印度尼西亚反动派最近又导演了“审讯”“九月三十日运动”的参加者和印度尼西亚共产党员的丑剧。事实上，应当受到审判的却正是他们自己，并且他们肯定会受到印度尼西亚人民的审判。正是印度尼西亚反动派根据美国中央情报局的命令，把军队开进雅加达，成立“将领委员会”，策划推翻苏加诺总统的政府的军事政变，以便取消印度尼西亚反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的路线，把印度尼西亚变成美国的新型殖民地。九月三十日运动反对的正是这一军事政变阴谋。
    社论指出，自从印度尼西亚获得独立以来，美国的走狗印度尼西亚反动派，曾不止一次地阴谋发动军事政变推翻苏加诺总统。但是这些阴谋都一个接着一个地被粉碎了。在印度尼西亚反动派的历次阴谋中，美帝国主义者的干涉和指挥的作用都充分暴露无遗。这一次，在印度尼西亚反动派反对印度尼西亚人民以及印度尼西亚的爱国和进步力量的运动中，美国又暴露了它作为指挥者的真面目。一些美国报纸透露，美国曾向印度尼西亚反动派提供大量美元来进行这一恐怖活动。美帝国主义者及其走狗对印度尼西亚反动派向印度尼西亚爱国进步力量发动进攻的疯狂行动表示高兴和满意。
    社论强调指出，很明显，美帝国主义是印度尼西亚目前严重局势的罪犯。美国在印度尼西亚事件中扮演了极端卑鄙和危险的角色，暴露了这一事件的国际性质。美帝国主义及其走狗的这些行动，目的不仅在于反对印度尼西亚人民和破坏印度尼西亚的独立和主权，而且还在于反对其它国家的人民，破坏各国的独立和亚洲以及世界的和平。
    社论最后说，越南人民要求全世界热爱独立、民主、和平和正义的人民迅速采取有效的和果断的行动，支持印度尼西亚人民和反对在美国指挥下的印度尼西亚反动派的野蛮行径，迫使印度尼西亚反动派停止他们在印度尼西亚的残酷的恐怖行动，立即释放所有被他们逮捕的人，赔偿受难者的损失和尊重印度尼西亚人民的民主自由。
