　　Xinhua News Agency, February 18th, New Delhi Dispatch: During his Far East tour to promote the US aggression plan in Vietnam, US Vice President Humphrey arrived in India on the 16th for a two-day visit and left New Delhi on the evening of the 17th for Canberra, Australia.

　　According to a United States Information Service report on the 18th, Humphrey said at a press conference held before leaving New Delhi that the Johnson administration expressed "satisfaction" and "support" for the Indian government's faithful "implementation" of the "Tashkent Declaration," a product of US-Soviet collusion, and announced that it would provide the Indian government with a $100 million "loan," urging the Indian reactionaries to continue to strengthen anti-China activities. Humphrey stated that the US government was resuming "aid" to India and Pakistan based on the "Tashkent spirit" of India and Pakistan having already "reconciled," and that the "US government does not want these aids to be used for the struggle between two friendly countries."

　　Reports from the United States Information Service and Indian newspapers also indicated that the main purpose of Humphrey's activities in India was to conspire with India to strengthen anti-China activities. According to a report in the *Times of India* on the 18th, Humphrey stated during meetings with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Foreign Minister Singh that "India and the United States can consult together on ensuring the security of Southeast Asia and containing China."

　　Humphrey and Indian Defense Minister Chavan also echoed each other in New Delhi, wantonly slandering China. At a press conference on the 17th, Humphrey slandered China as "the most aggressive country in the world today, threatening the peace of many countries, including India." Prior to this, Indian Defense Minister Chavan delivered a speech in the "People's Chamber" on the 16th, fabricating that China "continues to maintain a tense situation on the northern border," and he clamored that India "is taking appropriate defense measures to deal with the threat."

　　During his talks with Indian leaders, Humphrey also praised India's efforts to serve the United States on the Vietnam issue. According to a report in the *Hindustan Times* on the 18th: "Humphrey also praised India's 'very, very positive' efforts to achieve peace in Vietnam." "Regarding the question of what role India can play, he pointed out that his main purpose was to inform the government leaders here of the significance of the recent Honolulu meeting between President Johnson and South Vietnamese leaders. But he did not make specific requests" because "this is a matter for India to decide."

    汉弗莱在新德里同印度反动派进行新勾结
    策动印度加紧反华并为美侵越计划效劳
    对印政府忠实执行美苏合谋的产物“塔什干宣言”表示“满意”
    新华社十八日讯　新德里消息：美国副总统汉弗莱在他推销美国侵略越南计划的远东之行中，在十六日到达印度进行了两天的活动，十七日晚离开新德里前往澳大利亚的堪培拉。
    据美国新闻处十八日报道，汉弗莱在离开新德里前举行的记者招待会上说，约翰逊政府对印度政府忠实“执行”美苏合谋的产物“塔什干宣言”表示“满意”和“支持”，并且宣布将给印度政府一亿美元的“贷款”，要印度反动派继续加强反华活动。汉弗莱表示，美国政府是基于印度和巴基斯坦已经“和好”的“塔什干精神”才恢复给印度和巴基斯坦的“援助”的，“美国政府不想把这些援助用于两个友好国家的斗争上。”
    美国新闻处和印度报纸的报道也表明，汉弗莱在印度活动的主要目的是美印共谋加强反华活动。据《印度时报》十八日报道，汉弗莱在同印度总理甘地夫人和外交部长辛格举行会谈时都表示，“印度和美国可以在确保东南亚安全和遏制中国的问题上共同磋商”。
    汉弗莱和印度国防部长恰范在新德里还一唱一和地大肆诬蔑中国。汉弗莱在十七日的记者招待会上诬蔑中国是“今天世界上最富有侵略性的国家，威胁着包括印度在内的许多国家的和平”。在这之前，印度国防部长恰范十六日在“人民院”发表讲话，捏造中国“继续在北部边界保持紧张状态”，他叫嚷印度“正在采取适当的防御措施来对付威胁”。
    汉弗莱在同印度领导人会谈中还赞扬了印度在越南问题上努力为美国效劳。据《印度斯坦时报》十八日报道：“汉弗莱还称赞了印度为实现越南和平而作的‘非常、非常积极的’努力”。“对于印度能够起什么作用的问题，他指出，他的主要目的是把约翰逊总统和南越领袖最近的檀香山会议的意义告诉这里的政府领袖。但是他没有提出具体的要求。”因为“这是要由印度来决定的事情”。
