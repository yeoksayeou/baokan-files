    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi – Masud, Director of the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development, said at a public gathering in Rawalpindi recently that the Chinese people truly represent a vigorous nation. One of China's greatest achievements since liberation is that, through the organization of the People's Communes, people are now able to overcome natural disasters.

    Speaking about his impressions of visiting China last summer, he said that Chinese farmers, through collective labor, have built dams, reclaimed wasteland, and controlled soil erosion. He said that they have done so much that one gets the impression that they are striving to conquer nature.

    Masud said that the role of the People's Communes in industrial development can also be seen from the fact that many villages have established factories, grain processing plants, foundries, and even power plants.

    He pointed out that the People's Communes he visited have improved the material lives of the farmers. Speaking of the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people, he said that the Chinese truly represent a vigorous nation. They fully understand the meaning of the word "liberation." They know that their freedom was bought with blood. The Chinese fully believe that people are the masters of their own destiny.

    巴基斯坦农学家马苏德赞扬中国成就
    中国人民是朝气勃勃的民族
    新华社拉瓦尔品第电  巴基斯坦农村发展学院院长马苏德最近在拉瓦尔品第举行的一次公众集会上发表谈话说，中国人民真正代表了一个朝气勃勃的民族。中国在解放以后取得的最大成就之一是，通过人民公社组织，人现在已经能够战胜自然灾害。
    他在谈到去年夏季访问中国的观感时说，中国农民进行集体劳动修建了水坝、开垦了荒地、控制了水土流失。他说，他们做了那么多事情，给人的印象是他们正在努力征服大自然。
    马苏德说，从许多村庄建立了工厂、谷物加工厂、翻砂厂，甚至发电厂这些事实也可以看出人民公社对工业发展所起的作用。
    他指出，他参观过的人民公社改善了农民的物质生活。他在谈到中国人民的精神面貌时说，中国人真正代表了一个朝气勃勃的民族。他们充分了解解放这个词的含义。他们知道他们的自由是用鲜血换来的。中国人充分相信，人是自己命运的决定者。
