    Putting the Remolding of People First
    Zhao Changhai, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Liaoyuan Power Plant
    A socialist enterprise has three tasks: producing products, producing experience, and producing talent. Only by cultivating a revolutionary and highly conscious industrial army can we produce good products and create advanced experiences in work and production.
    We did not clearly understand this point in the past. We thought that the only task of an enterprise was to produce material products. Our power plant was to produce a continuous supply of electricity. Therefore, we placed political and ideological work, the work of educating and remolding people, in a secondary position. We emphasized technology and downplayed politics, emphasized production and downplayed ideology, and did not give prominence to politics in all our work.
    In the practice of recent years, we have realized that the human factor is indeed the most important. The production of a power plant is continuous, and power outages cannot be stopped even for a second. Operators monitor the changes of each instrument pointer twenty-four hours a day. People tend to doze off at night. In the old society, although the capitalists were very strict with the workers, the workers still tried to doze off and sleep, and accidents often happened as a result. Our workers today, also working the night shift, also monitoring each instrument, do not doze off. They stare wide-eyed like guarding against the enemy, monitoring every instrument's action, adjusting and operating diligently to ensure the safety of production.
    What is the reason for this? The most important reason is that we have a contingent of workers educated and remolded by Mao Zedong Thought. They dare to think, dare to act, dare to break foreign frameworks, and dare to transform old equipment. They do whatever the Party tells them to do, are not afraid of hardship, are not afraid of fatigue, go wherever they are told, can go up or down [in position]. They love the factory as their home and are diligent and frugal. In their work, they are never satisfied with the achievements they have made; in their lives, they are simple and unadorned, and look to lower standards. With such a contingent of workers, we have no heights we cannot climb and no fortresses we cannot conquer.

    把改造人的工作放在首位
    辽源发电厂党委副书记　赵长海
    社会主义企业有三个任务：出产品，出经验，出人材。只有培养出一支有高度觉悟的革命化的产业军，才有可能生产出好的产品，也才有可能创造工作和生产方面的先进经验。
    对于这一点，过去我们是认识得不清楚的。我们以为，企业唯一的任务是生产物质产品，我们发电厂就是生产源源不断的电力，因此把政治思想工作，教育人改造人的工作，放到了次要地位，重技术，轻政治，重生产，轻思想，没有在一切工作中突出政治。
    在近几年来的实践中，我们体会到，人的因素第一，确实是千真万确的。发电厂的生产是连续的，一秒钟也不能停电，运行人员是二十四小时不停的监视着每块仪表指针的变化。夜间人们总是容易打盹。在旧社会，资本家对工人虽然管得很严，工人仍然设法偷着打盹、睡觉，往往就这样发生了事故。我们今天的工人，同样值夜班，同样监视每块仪表，他们却不打盹，瞪大两只眼睛象监视敌人那样的监视着每一块仪表的动作，尽心的调正和操作，保证了生产的安全。
    这是什么原因呢？最重要的一条，就是因为我们有了一支用毛泽东思想教育和改造了的职工队伍。他们敢想、敢干、敢于打破洋框框，敢于改造旧设备。他们是党叫干啥就干啥，不怕苦、不怕累，指那打那，能上能下。他们爱厂如家，勤俭节约。他们在工作上，永不满足已取得的成绩；在生活上艰苦朴素，向低标准看齐。有了一支这样的职工队伍，我们就无高不可攀，无坚不可摧。
