    He Will Always Live in My Heart
    Xu Junya
    (Comrade Xu Junya is the wife of Comrade Jiao Yulu and currently works in the Statistics Section of the Lankao County People's Committee. The following is Comrade Xu Junya's recollection of Comrade Jiao Yulu.)
    I have lived with Comrade Jiao Yulu for over ten years, and he never seemed to know what "difficulty" meant. I remember when we first transferred from local work to industrial work, the difficulties were immense! He had little education and had never seen a machine before. When others explained things to him, he couldn't understand anything. Blueprints were placed in front of him, and he couldn't make sense of them even if his eyes were strained. At the time, some people said, "Look, someone who used to pull an ox's tail is now learning about industry!" But he didn't listen to them and faced the difficulties head-on. When he interned at the Dalian Crane Factory, he served as the workshop director. He gradually learned to read blueprints and could do some of the work himself. The worker comrades all liked him, saying, "Old Jiao is really something, he has a great drive, he is our good director!"
    After arriving in Lankao, he often went to the countryside, sometimes for more than ten days at a time. We saw each other less often than before. Sometimes we would meet on the road, and he would always smile at me and then hurriedly ride away on his bicycle.
    I remember it was the summer of 1963, and it rained heavily for several days in a row. He braved the heavy rain and went to the countryside. He didn't return until several days later. He said to me, "This rain is really good." I blamed him, saying, "Almost all of Lankao County is flooded, and you say it's good!" He said, "Junya, if it didn't rain so much, how would we know the extent of the flooding? You can't stop the heavens from raining, so this year we're flooded; but when you find out the water situation, and know the height of the terrain, you can control the heavens, and next year we won't let it flood." After a year of hard work, in 1964 it rained just as much, but the flooded land was greatly reduced.
    In his bedroom, by the rattan chair, on the bed, were all sorts of small things, long-handled brushes, teapot lids. Whenever his liver pain was severe, he would use these hard things to press against the painful area. But I saw that no matter how much his liver hurt, no matter how late he returned from meetings, he never forgot to study for a moment. Sometimes he would lie on his stomach with the corner of the desk pressing against his liver, still reading newspapers, documents, and studying Chairman Mao's works. I would persuade him to rest, and he would often say to me, "If you don't read the newspaper, you don't know what's happening in the world; if you don't read the documents, you can't understand the Party's policies; if you don't read Chairman Mao's works, you'll lose your way. I feel that my liver doesn't hurt when I read Chairman Mao's books."
    He often said to me that as a leader, one must always lead by example, not be special, and completely abide by the Party's policies. After arriving in Lankao, our whole family moved into the county Party committee compound. There were many children in the courtyard, and they often ran around the yard, shouting and making noise, sometimes rushing into the office and affecting work. The county Party committee then made a decision to have all family members move out of the compound. At the time, I didn't want to move; it was convenient to live in the compound, close to work, and it was convenient to use the furniture and get hot water. I wanted to wait and see, and move after others moved. After Old Jiao knew what I was thinking, he said to me seriously, "You only care about your own convenience, and forget about the inconvenience to work. If everyone waits for others, no one will move. We should be the first to move." After we moved, other comrades also moved out of the compound one by one.
    In the winter of 1962, the leadership knew that my family had many children and that there was a problem with winter cotton clothes, so they decided to give us three jin of cotton as consideration. He never let me buy it. No matter how many times I talked to him, he firmly replied, "A leader must never be special."
    Not far from our house, there was a large pit pond, which originally had some wild fish in it. Old Jiao discovered that this pond could be used for raising fish, so he had people put in tens of thousands of fish fry. He loved the fish very much. Sometimes when he saw the fishing team going to fish, he would join them. Sometimes he would scoop up the fish to see how big they had grown, and then put them back in the water. One day, the comrades from the fish farm brought more than a dozen live fish to my house in a bucket, saying, "Secretary Jiao has put so much effort into this fish pond, let him have a taste of these fish." The children were very happy when they saw the fish. The second son, Yuejin, lay on the edge of the bucket to catch the fish, shouting, "I want to eat fish, I want to eat fish." After Old Jiao found out, he said to the children, "These fish were raised by the uncles' labor, we can't take them." After saying that, he put the fish in a basin and had the eldest son, Guoqing, return them to the fish farm.
    After we came to Lankao, my older brother and sister-in-law kept saying to me, "Why don't you let your nephew Xintai be Old Jiao's messenger? Isn't it better than using someone else? That child writes well and can do calculations quickly; if he is a messenger for a few years, he can be promoted to a cadre!" I knew Old Jiao's temper and didn't dare to mention it. But I couldn't stop them from constantly nagging me, so once I mentioned it to him. Before I could finish speaking, he interrupted me and said, "No! Now agriculture needs educated youth, the countryside is vast and there is much to be done, let him work hard there. I am a county Party secretary, I can't just use anyone and lead the way in violating state policy."
    In life, he never felt what "bitterness" meant. I knew he was sick, and sometimes I would buy him some fish or meat, but he wouldn't eat it, always saying, "Our life is already much better than the poor and lower-middle peasants. I used to come from a poor background, don't waste life!" He had a thin quilt that he had used for many years, and it would tear with the slightest pull. His socks were patched with patches on the soles and tops, but he still refused to buy new ones. Once, I was so angry that I didn't patch them for him, so he picked up a piece of cloth and patched them himself.
    Old Jiao loved children very much, and the children also loved him. As soon as they saw him come home, they would rush over and climb all over him. He would carry one on his back, hold one in his arms, and hang one on his arm, happily entering the house. He would sing revolutionary songs to them and tell them revolutionary stories.
    But he was also very strict with the children. Once, Guoqing wanted to buy a notebook, and he first had to see if the old notebook was finished. If there was even one cent left over from buying something, he would ask the child to return it. He said, "We should educate children to develop a habit of thrift from an early age." During the wheat harvest, he would take the children to the countryside to participate in labor, so that they would know how hard it is for farmers to grow grain.
    In the Spring Festival of 1964, it snowed heavily. Old Jiao told me that the organization had approved his trip back to Zibo, Shandong to visit relatives. I thought it would be inconvenient to bring so many children on the road, and suggested bringing fewer children. But he insisted on bringing all six children back to his hometown. Shandong was an old liberated area, and there were many martyrs' monuments along the way. Along the way, he pointed to the martyrs' monuments and told the children stories of the revolutionary martyrs' heroic struggles against the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang bandits.
    Early in the morning on the second day after arriving in Beigu Village, Old Jiao led the whole family to the wilderness. I asked him what he was going to do, and he said he was going to visit the graves. I asked strangely, "You are not superstitious and don't burn incense, what are you doing visiting the graves?" He smiled and said, "I haven't been back to my hometown for many years, I'm going to take a look." After walking for a while, he pointed to a mountain in front of us and told us that when he was a militiaman, he had fought there and driven the Kuomintang bandits into a rout.
    When we arrived at the graveyard, he pointed to a grave and said to the children, "Do you know how your grandfather died? He was forced to hang himself by the landlord because of debt. At that time, our whole family ate vegetables boiled in clear water. Your eldest brother also died of cold and starvation on the road of fleeing famine. When I was a child, I went up the mountain to chop firewood and cut grass every day, and helped to twist straw ropes at night. When I grew up, I carried work for the landlord and dug coal mines for the Japanese. You see, how much oppression the poor suffered before liberation, how bitter life was. Compared to now, how happy our life is. If you don't study hard, how can you be worthy of the Communist Party that liberated us poor people!" At this time, I understood why he insisted on bringing all the children back to his hometown.
    When he knew that his illness was serious, he told me, "Junya, you must be strong, you must hold on, and never fall down. You must always listen to the Party, creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, work hard, and educate the children to become red revolutionary successors. Be more frugal in life, and don't casually ask the organization for money or things."
    Although Old Jiao has been gone for more than a year, his words are still echoing in my ears. He will always live in my heart. I must learn from his revolutionary spirit, inherit his legacy, and dedicate everything I have to completely changing the face of Lankao. (Attached picture)

    他永远活在我的心里
    徐俊雅
    （徐俊雅同志是焦裕禄同志的爱人，现在兰考县人民委员会统计科工作。下面是徐俊雅同志对焦裕禄同志的回忆。）
    我同焦裕禄同志生活在一起已有十多年，他好象永远不知道啥叫“难”。记得我们才从地方转到工业上那会儿，那困难才大呢！他文化不高，从来没有见过机器，别人给他介绍情况，他啥也听不懂。图纸摆在面前，看花了眼也不明白。当时有人就说：“看，拉牛尾巴的人也来学工业！”可他不听这些，还是迎着困难干。在大连起重机厂实习的时候，他担任车间主任。他慢慢学会了看图纸，什么活也能干一些了。工人同志都喜欢他，说：“老焦真行，钻劲儿大，是咱们的好主任！”
    到兰考以后，他经常下乡，时常一去就是十多天。我们见面的机会比过去少了。有时我们在路上遇见，他总是朝我笑一笑，就匆匆忙忙骑车走了。
    记得那是一九六三年的夏天，一连几天下大雨。他冒着猛雨下乡去了。好几天以后才回来。他对我说：“这雨下得真好。”我责怪他说：“一个兰考县都快淹完了，还好呢！”他说：“俊雅，不下这么大的雨，怎能知道它淹到啥程度？你挡不住老天下雨，今年受淹了；可当你查明了水情，知道了地势高低，就能制住老天，明年咱们就不叫它淹。”经过一年的苦干，一九六四年同样下了很多雨，受淹的地就大大减少了。
    在他的卧室里，藤椅边，床上，放着各种各样的小东西，有长把刷、茶壶盖，每当肝痛得厉害的时候，他就拿这些硬东西顶着疼的地方。可是我见他不管肝多么疼，开会回来多么晚，一刻也不忘记学习，有时趴着用台角顶着肝部，还在读报纸、文件、学习毛主席著作。我劝他休息，他常对我说：“不读报纸不知道天下大事，不看文件不能领会党的政策，不读毛主席著作就要迷失方向。我觉得读毛主席的书肝就不疼了。”
    他时常对我说，作一个领导人，要处处以身作则，不要特殊化，要完完全全遵照党的政策办事。到兰考后，我们全家搬到县委机关住。院子里孩子很多，他们常常叫着闹着满院奔跑，有时就闯到办公室里，影响工作。县委就作出决定，让家属全部搬出机关。当时我不想搬，住在机关里上班近，用家具、打热水都方便。我想看一看，等别人搬了我再搬。老焦知道我的心思以后，就严肃地对我说：“你光图自己生活方便，就忘了对工作不方便。要是谁都看着别人，就一个也搬不走。我们应该第一个搬。”我们搬家以后，别的同志也一个个搬出了机关。
    一九六二年冬天，领导上知道我家孩子多，过冬棉衣有问题，决定照顾我们三斤棉花。他一直不让我去买。我一再向他说，他都坚决地回答：“一个领导人，绝不能特殊。”
    离我们家不远，有一个大坑塘，原来塘里有一些野鱼。老焦发现这个塘可以养鱼，就让人给放了几万尾鱼苗。他非常爱鱼，有时看到捕鱼队去打鱼，就跟同他们一起打鱼。有时他把鱼捞上来看看长多大了，再放回水里。有一天，渔场的同志用桶装了十多条活鱼到我家，说：“焦书记为这鱼塘没少操了心，这几条鱼让他尝尝鲜吧。”孩子们看到鱼喜欢得什么似的，二儿子跃进趴在桶边上捞鱼，直嚷：“俺要吃鱼，俺要吃鱼。”老焦知道后，对孩子们说：“这鱼是叔叔们劳动养大的，咱们不能要。”说罢，把鱼放在盆里，让大儿子国庆送还了渔场。
    我们来兰考后，我哥哥嫂子不断对我说：“让你侄新太给老焦当个通讯员，不比用别人强吗？那孩子字写得好，算盘打得哗啦啦，当几年通讯员不就提升成干部啦！”我知道老焦的脾气，没敢提。可挡不住他们老是絮叨，有一次就向他提起这事。话还没说完，他就打断我说：“不中！现在农业上需要知识青年，那里的天地很广阔，让他在那里好好干。我是一个县委书记，我不能随便用人，带头违反国家的政策。”
    在生活上，他从来不感到啥叫“苦”。我知道他有病，有时给他买点鱼肉，他不肯吃，总是说：“咱们的生活比起贫下中农已经好得多了。我过去也是受苦人出身，生活可不要浪费啊！”他的一条薄被子不知盖了多少年，轻轻一扯就是个窟窿。那双袜子，袜底袜筒补钉压补钉，还不肯买新的。有一次，我气得不给他补，他就拿起一块布自己补了起来。
    老焦非常爱孩子，孩子们也爱他，一见他回家，总是扑过去，一个个往他身上爬。他就背上驮一个，怀里抱一个，胳膊上挎一个，高高兴兴进屋来，他给他们唱革命歌曲，讲革命故事。
    可是他对孩子们的要求也很严格。有一次国庆要买本子，他先要看看旧本写完没有。买了东西剩一分钱也要向孩子要回来。他说：“应该教育孩子从小养成节约的习惯。”割麦的时候，他就带着孩子们下乡，参加劳动，让他们知道农民种粮食是多么辛苦。
    一九六四年春节，雪下得很大。老焦告诉我，组织上批准他回山东淄博探亲。我嫌拉大带小路上不方便，主张少带些孩子。可他坚持要把六个孩子全部带回老家。山东是老解放区，沿途立着不少烈士纪念碑。一路上，他指着一块块烈士碑，对孩子们讲革命烈士同日本鬼子国民党匪帮英勇搏斗的故事。
    到北古村的第二天清早，老焦领着全家来到野地里，我问他干什么去，他说上坟去。我奇怪地问：“你不迷信，不烧香，上坟干啥？”他笑笑说：“多年不回老家，看看去。”走了一会儿，他指着前面一个山头，告诉我们，他当民兵时，就在那里打过仗，把国民党匪帮打得狼狈溃逃。
    到了坟地，他指着一座坟，对孩子们说：“你们知道你们的爷爷是怎么死的吗？他是被地主逼债上吊死的。那时咱们全家吃的是清水煮野菜。你们的大哥哥也是逃荒路上冻饿病死的。我小时候，天天上山砍柴、割草，晚上帮着搓草绳，长大后给地主扛活，给日本人挖煤窑。你们看，解放前穷人受多大压迫，生活多么苦，比比现在，咱们的生活多么幸福。你们要是不好好学习，怎能对得起解放咱们穷人的共产党啊！”这时，我才明白他为什么坚持要把孩子们全部带回老家。
    当他知道自己病情严重的时候，他嘱咐我说：“俊雅，你一定要坚强起来，你要顶得住，决不能倒下去。你要永远听党的话，活学活用毛主席著作，好好工作，把孩子们教育成为红色的革命接班人。生活上要艰苦一些，不要随便伸手向组织上要钱要东西。”
    老焦虽然离开我们一年多了，但是他说的话一直在我的耳边回响，他永远活在我的心里。我一定要学习他的革命精神，继承他的遗志，为彻底改变兰考的面貌，献出我的一切。（附图片）
