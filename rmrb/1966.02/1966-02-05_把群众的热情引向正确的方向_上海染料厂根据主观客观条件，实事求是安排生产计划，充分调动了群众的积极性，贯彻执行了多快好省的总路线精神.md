    Guiding the Enthusiasm of the Masses in the Right Direction
    Shanghai Dyestuff Factory, Based on Subjective and Objective Conditions, Truthfully Arranges Production Plans, Fully Mobilizing the Enthusiasm of the Masses, Implementing the General Line of Going All Out, Aiming High, and Achieving Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results

    (Our Report) The leading cadres of Shanghai Dyestuff Factory, in the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, resolutely implement Comrade Mao Zedong’s teaching of “becoming sober promoters,” comprehensively consider subjective and objective conditions, and truthfully arrange and implement this year’s production plan. As a result of their actions, they have not only fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the workers and masses but also correctly guided the enthusiasm of the masses, comprehensively implementing the spirit of the General Line of going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results.
    The Tobias acid produced by this factory is an important raw material for the production of dyes and pharmaceuticals. At the end of last year, the factory's leading cadres, according to the arrangements of higher authorities, mobilized the masses to discuss this year's production plan. At the cadre meetings, they communicated the situation, tasks, and policies, enabling everyone to understand the relationship between their production and national construction. Then they announced to the Tobias acid workshop cadres that, according to the requirements of higher authorities and the factory's situation, the output of Tobias acid should be increased from 150 tons last year to 200 tons this year.
    The workshop leader of the Tobias acid workshop felt uneasy upon hearing the factory director's words. He spread his hands and said, "Director, if you give me such a small task, how can I explain it to the workers when I go back?" It turned out that the workshop's production capacity had already been greatly improved. Moreover, the experiment they were conducting on innovating the technological process was on the verge of success. The success of this innovation would further increase the production capacity to a level of 300 tons per year. Therefore, the workshop cadres felt that the output target set by the factory could not only be completed but also exceeded, and they suspected that this might dampen the innovative enthusiasm of the masses.
    The factory leaders told him, "Two hundred tons is not a small amount. We should not only focus on output but also consider ensuring quality, increasing the yield rate, reducing costs, and improving labor productivity, so as to achieve an all-round leap forward."
    The workshop leader returned to the workshop, conveyed to the workers the spirit of the leadership's proposal to comprehensively implement the General Line of going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results in production, and proposed: We must do a good job in innovation as soon as possible, so that the production process of Tobias acid will be as short as possible, the number of personnel as small as possible, and the technical level as high as possible. The workers listened, and their production enthusiasm and innovative zeal were even more elevated, and they intensified their experiments.
    The factory's leading cadres had already comprehensively considered the task of producing Tobias acid this year: the supply of raw materials for Tobias acid is limited, and the new technological process has not yet become a reality. Under such circumstances, as the factory's leading cadres, when considering the production plan, they should not only tap potential and increase the production of products needed by the country as much as possible; at the same time, they should also be realistic and base their plans on the real possibilities of objective material conditions, so that the plan is not only active but also prudent, reliable, and allows for leeway.
    They also believed that it is necessary to guide the masses to correctly treat the state's plans with a positive attitude, and also to cherish the production enthusiasm of the masses and not dampen their innovative enthusiasm. They thought that they should vigorously support the workers in the Tobias acid workshop in creating a new production technology process; and after the production task of Tobias acid is completed far ahead of schedule, they should let them produce high-grade plastic pigments that the country urgently needs. This new product, which is up to the level of the 1960s, was successfully trial-produced by the factory's laboratory last year, and the workers in the Tobias acid workshop are fully capable of mastering it, and there is no need to add any equipment.
    With the support of the factory leaders, the innovation in the Tobias acid workshop was carried out more effectively. The biggest difficulty in the innovation was that a certain material in the production process might explode. After several small experiments, no problems occurred, and the workshop cadres and workers were eager to put the new technological process into production, and suggested conducting large-scale experiments in the production equipment. The technical department approved this request. Just as the raw materials were put into the equipment and the experiment was about to begin, the factory leaders, based on the different opinions put forward by the quality inspection department, required the workshop to stop the experiment and conduct a special explosion test in small equipment, thereby finding a more reliable safety factor. Before the second experiment, in order to ensure the safety of the experiment, the factory leaders asked the workshop and relevant personnel to re-check and calibrate the instruments on the equipment. For the third time, the factory leaders discovered that the workshop had not fully prepared for safety protection. Based on Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings: we must consider the worst possible situation and strive for the best possible results, they had the workshop make all safety preparations. After these efforts, the workers not only mastered the objective laws but also had a reliable safety guarantee, and finally made the large-scale experiment a success in one fell swoop. On New Year's Day this year, the new technological process was officially put into production. Now, on the basis of ensuring stable quality, the yield rate of Tobias acid has been improved, costs have been reduced, equipment and personnel have been reduced, and the annual output of 300 tons has been achieved.
    Based on this situation, the factory leaders formally told the workshop cadres to prepare to accept new tasks and produce high-grade plastic pigments that the country urgently needs after completing the annual production plan of Tobias acid ahead of schedule.
    The enthusiasm of the workshop cadres and workers has been even higher after the success of this innovation. Not satisfied with the existing achievements, they have started new experiments in order to create a more advanced technological process. They heard the hopes put forward by the factory leaders and carried out innovation with even greater enthusiasm, striving to make greater contributions to the country.

    把群众的热情引向正确的方向
    上海染料厂根据主观客观条件，实事求是安排生产计划，充分调动了群众的积极性，贯彻执行了多快好省的总路线精神
    本报讯　上海染料厂领导干部在增产节约运动中坚决贯彻执行毛泽东同志的“做冷静促进派”的教导，全面考虑了主观和客观条件，实事求是地安排落实了今年的生产计划。他们这样做的结果，既充分调动了职工群众的积极性，又正确地引导了群众的积极性。全面贯彻执行了多快好省的总路线的精神。
    这家工厂生产的吐氏酸是生产染料和药品的重要原料。去年年底，工厂领导干部根据上级布置，发动群众讨论了今年的生产计划。他们在干部会上交形势、交任务、交政策，使大家了解了自己的生产同国家建设的关系之后，向吐氏酸工段干部宣布，根据上级要求和工厂情况，吐氏酸的产量要从去年的一百五十吨提高到今年的二百吨。
    吐氏酸工段长听了厂长的话，感到为难，把手一摊说：“厂长，你给我这么一点任务，叫我回去怎样向工人交代？”原来，这个工段的生产能力已经有很大提高。而且，他们正在进行的革新工艺路线的试验，已经成功在望。这项革新成功，又将把生产能力提高到年产三百吨的水平。因此，这个工段干部感到厂里订的产量指标，不仅可以完成，而且可以超过，怀疑这样是否会挫伤群众的革新积极性。
    工厂领导对他说：“二百吨不少了。我们不应该光看到产量，还要考虑到确保质量，提高收得率、降低成本、提高劳动生产率，来一个全面跃进。”
    工段长回到工段，向工人传达了领导上提出的在生产中全面贯彻多快好省的总路线精神，并且提出：我们要尽快地搞好革新，使吐氏酸的生产流程越短越好，人员越省越好，技术水平越高越好。工人们听了，生产积极性和革新热情更加高涨，加紧进行试验。
    工厂领导干部对今年生产吐氏酸的任务早就有过全面的考虑：吐氏酸的原料供应有限，新的工艺路线还没有变成现实。在这样的情况下，作为工厂的领导干部，在考虑生产计划的时候，不但要挖掘潜力，尽可能增产国家需要的产品；同时，还要实事求是地根据客观物质条件的现实可能性，使计划既是积极的，又是稳妥、可靠、留有余地的。
    他们还认为，既要引导群众用积极的态度正确对待国家的计划，又要爱惜群众的生产热情，不要挫伤群众的革新热情。他们想，应该大力支持吐氏酸工段的工人，创造一条新的生产工艺路线；而在吐氏酸生产任务大大提早完成以后，就让他们生产国家急需的高级塑料颜料。这种具有六十年代水平的新品种，工厂试验室在去年就试制成功，吐氏酸工段的工人完全能够掌握，而且不需要增添任何设备。
    在工厂领导支持下，吐氏酸工段的革新更有成效地进行。革新中的最大困难是，生产过程中一种物料可能发生爆炸。经过几次小试验，没有发生问题，工段的干部和工人就急于把新的工艺路线投入生产，建议在生产设备里进行大试验。技术部门批准了这个要求。正当原料投入设备，即将开始试验时，工厂领导根据质量检验部门提出的不同意见，要求工段把试验停止下来，在小设备里专门进行爆炸试验，从而找到了更加可靠的安全系数。第二次试验之前，工厂领导为了确保试验安全，要工段和有关人员重新检查和校正了设备上的仪表。第三次，工厂领导发觉工段里没有充分做好安全防护准备。他们根据毛泽东同志教导：要从最坏处着想，向最好处努力，让工段里作好一切防护准备。经过这些努力之后，工人们既掌握了客观规律，又有了可靠的安全保证，终于使大试验一次成功。今年元旦，新的工艺路线正式用到了生产上。现在，吐氏酸在确保质量稳定的基础上，收得率提高，成本下降，设备、人员减少，达到了年产三百吨的水平。
    根据这个情况，工厂领导正式告诉工段干部，要他们准备在提前完成吐氏酸年产计划以后，接受新的任务，生产国家急需的高级塑料颜料。
    工段干部和工人在这次革新成功后，积极性更加高涨。他们不满足于已有的成绩，又着手进行新的试验，以便创造一条更加先进的工艺路线。他们听到工厂领导提出的希望，更加干劲十足地进行革新，争取为国家作出更大的贡献。
