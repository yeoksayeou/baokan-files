    Chairman Mao showed concern and sent greetings to Mai Xiande
    He sent Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying to visit him in the hospital, and they also conveyed Vice Chairman Lin Biao's message to Mai Xiande, telling him to concentrate on recovering from his injuries. Mai Xiande expressed his determination to listen to Chairman Mao and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th - Vice Premier of the State Council He Long and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying visited the steel warrior Mai Xiande at the General Hospital of the Guangzhou Military Region this morning, conveying Chairman Mao's and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's concern and greetings to him.
    When Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying arrived at the hospital, Mai Xiande excitedly walked out of the ward to greet them. Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying presented him with two bouquets of flowers. Mai Xiande tightly grasped the hands of Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying and repeatedly said, "Hello, Chiefs! Hello, Chiefs!"
    Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying took Mai Xiande's hand and walked into the ward together, sitting down by his bedside. Comrade He Long said to Mai Xiande, "Chairman Mao is very concerned about you and sent us to see you." Mai Xiande said excitedly, "Thank you, Chairman Mao!" Comrade Ye Jianying continued, "Vice Chairman Lin is very concerned about you and called to send you his regards, asking you to concentrate on recovering from your injuries." Mai Xiande said, "Thank you, Vice Chairman Lin!" Then, Comrade He Long said to Mai Xiande, "You have performed meritorious service for the Party and the people. You are a hero." Comrade Ye Jianying said, "The entire army is learning from you now." Mai Xiande modestly waved his hands repeatedly and said, "Not enough! Not enough!"
    Comrade He Long stood up, gently removed Mai Xiande's military cap, and carefully examined his wound. Comrade Ye Jianying also took Mai Xiande's right hand, examined it carefully, and then said, "Chairman Mao wants us to tell you to focus on recovering from your injuries. You must listen to Chairman Mao and recover well." Mai Xiande said, "I will definitely read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao!" Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying nodded happily and said, "Good! Good!"
    Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying asked the doctors and nurses present about Mai Xiande's treatment. When they heard that Mai Xiande's health was improving day by day, Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying were very happy and instructed the doctors and nurses, "Take good care of him, pay attention to nutrition, and pay attention to rest."
    Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying repeatedly instructed Mai Xiande to recover from his injuries. Mai Xiande couldn't help but sing "I Am a Soldier." Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying listened and nodded and applauded continuously. Comrade He Long said, "You sing very well. You still remember it so clearly after being injured. Your injury can slowly recover." Comrade Ye Jianying said, "I hope you recover from your injuries and return to the battle post. If the enemy dares to come again, then fight again!" Mai Xiande clenched his fist and said, "Fight!" Comrade He Long said, "You have to recover from your injuries before you fight again." Mai Xiande repeatedly said, "Fight! Fight!"
    Before leaving, Mai Xiande repeatedly expressed his gratitude for Chairman Mao's concern. He once again excitedly sang the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." When Mai Xiande saw Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying to the door, he raised his hand and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"
    Accompanying Comrades He Long and Ye Jianying to the hospital to express their condolences to Mai Xiande were Su Zhenhua and Zhou Xihan, responsible persons of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, and Wen Niansheng, Tao Hanzhang, and Xiang Wei, responsible persons of the Guangzhou Military Region.

    毛主席关怀和问候麦贤得
    派贺龙、叶剑英同志前去医院看望，他们并转达了林彪副主席要麦贤得全心全意养好伤。麦贤得表示一定要听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好战士。
    新华社广州八日电　国务院副总理贺龙，国防委员会副主席叶剑英，今天上午前往广州部队总医院看望钢铁战士麦贤得，转达了毛主席、林彪副主席对他的关怀和问候。
    贺龙同志、叶剑英同志来到医院时，麦贤得兴奋地走出病房，迎上前去，贺龙同志、叶剑英同志把两束鲜花送给麦贤得。麦贤得紧紧地握着贺龙同志、叶剑英同志的手连声地说：“首长好！首长好！”
    贺龙同志、叶剑英同志携着麦贤得的手，一同走入病房，在病床前坐下来。贺龙同志对麦贤得说：“毛主席对你很关怀，派我们来看你”。麦贤得激动地说：“感谢毛主席！”叶剑英同志接着说：“林副主席对你很关心，打电话来向你问候，要你全心全意把伤养好。”麦贤得说：“谢谢林副主席！”接着，贺龙同志对麦贤得说：“你为党为人民立了功，你是英雄。”叶剑英同志说：“现在全军都向你学习。”麦贤得谦虚地连连摆手说：“不够！不够！”
    贺龙同志站起来，轻轻地脱下麦贤得的军帽，细致地观察了他的伤口。叶剑英同志也拉起麦贤得的右手，细致地看了又看，然后说：“毛主席要我们告诉你，要安心把伤养好。你要听毛主席的话，好好养伤。”麦贤得表示：“我一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士！”贺龙同志、叶剑英同志高兴地点头说：“好！好！”
    贺龙同志、叶剑英同志向在座的医生、护士询问了对麦贤得治疗的情况。当听到麦贤得的身体一天比一天好起来之后，贺龙同志、叶剑英同志很高兴，并且嘱咐医生、护士：“要好好地照护他，注意营养，注意休息。”
    贺龙同志、叶剑英同志一再地嘱咐麦贤得把伤养好。麦贤得情不自禁地唱起了《我是一个兵》。贺龙同志、叶剑英同志听了，不住地点头、鼓掌。贺龙同志说：“唱得很好，你负伤之后还记得这样清楚，你的伤是能够慢慢好起来的。”叶剑英同志说：“希望你养好伤，重回战斗岗位，如果敌人胆敢再来，就再打！”麦贤得握紧拳头说：“打！”贺龙同志说：“要把伤养好了再打。”麦贤得连连地说：“打！打！”
    临别前，麦贤得一再表示：感谢毛主席的关怀。他又一次兴奋地唱起了《大海航行靠舵手》这支歌。麦贤得送贺龙同志、叶剑英同志到门口时，举手高呼：“毛主席万岁！中国共产党万岁！”
    陪同贺龙同志、叶剑英同志前往医院慰问麦贤得的，还有中国人民解放军海军负责人苏振华、周希汉，广州部队负责人文年生、陶汉章、相炜等。
