　　To serve the people, one must trust the people. Believing in the past that disaster areas lacked advanced models was a manifestation of not trusting the people. In reality, the people of Binhai possess a spirit of creativity. Discovering, summarizing, and promoting the experiences of these advanced models can transform spirit into a tremendous material force.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was able to understand the objective laws of Lankao in a relatively short period and quickly change Lankao's face because, fundamentally, he possessed deep class feelings and was adept at creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. When I came to work in Binhai, I also harbored the ambition to change Binhai's face. However, in my work, I did not pay enough attention to the human factor, and the work with people was not done well. My understanding of the importance of the revolutionization of the organs, especially the revolutionization of the county committee leadership, was not profound enough, and I did not grasp it tightly. The facts have profoundly educated me that, in this way, being busy with day-to-day work, I dropped the key link of highlighting politics and creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The more I worked, the more difficult it became, and the production increase measures could not be promoted. In 1965, I failed to complete the production tasks, made no contribution to the country, and even dragged the country down.
    To transform nature, one must understand nature and grasp its laws. After arriving in Binhai, I still had not formulated a practical and feasible concrete plan to change Binhai's face after more than a year. In the past, I always thought that I was basically familiar with the situation in Binhai and had a general understanding of it. I was complacent and also had thoughts of fearing hardship and difficulty. Therefore, I did not go down to conduct investigations seriously and systematically. When I went to the countryside, I went to the communes more often and the brigades and production teams less often. I spent more time running around the surface and less time squatting down to investigate. I only contacted cadres to understand the situation and rarely discussed issues with poor and lower-middle peasants. Especially in grasping models and advanced examples, I did not, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, come from the masses and go to the masses, carefully summarize experiences with deep class feelings, and establish local benchmarks. I believed that Binhai had poor conditions, backward production, and no advanced experiences to summarize, and no good role models to learn from. In fact, this is wrong, and it is a lack of understanding of the fundamental idea that "the masses of the people have unlimited creativity." Even Lankao, with such severe disasters and such poor natural conditions, had good models and good examples; although Binhai is also an old disaster area, its natural conditions are much better compared to Lankao. The people of Binhai have a revolutionary spirit of creativity, and there are many advanced experiences to summarize and advanced models to learn from. The problem is that I did not go deep into the masses, deep into reality, to discover, cultivate, summarize, and promote them in a timely manner, and I was unable to give play to the promoting role of advanced experiences and advanced models in the county's production.
    Combining point-based promotion with general appeals and individual guidance is the leadership method that Chairman Mao taught us we must adopt. After arriving in Binhai, I did not insist on fighting on the front line of production like Comrade Jiao Yulu, but was satisfied with general appeals and lacked individual guidance. In my work, I did not insist on squatting down to create models, but looked at points and ran at points; I did not insist on laboring and working on the front line, but squatted in the organs more and went deep into reality less, lacking deep class feelings for the nearly one million people of Binhai. I came from a poor peasant family, but since joining the work, I have spent a relatively long time squatting in the organs, and my class feelings have gradually weakened. I lack a concrete understanding of the difficulties of the broad masses, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, and I lack a deep understanding of their urgent desire to change their production and living conditions.
    In the past few days, in the process of studying, some comrades have reflected: How good it would be if we had a county party secretary like Comrade Jiao Yulu in Binhai! Hearing these words, I deeply felt that this is the masses' demand of me and their spurring on of me.
    Now, the provincial party committee and the prefectural party committee are very concerned about changing Binhai's face and have strengthened their leadership over us; the path to change Binhai's face is also relatively clear. To realize this plan to change the face, we must also carry out arduous work and arduous labor.
    In this arduous struggle, we must conscientiously grasp the ideological revolutionization and leadership revolutionization of the county committee. First of all, I must revolutionize myself, aspire to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu and be a good "squad leader," highlight politics, creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, transform my thinking, improve my leadership, change my work style, and be wholeheartedly for the revolution and wholeheartedly for the people. For the people, we must trust the people, rely on the people, adhere to self-reliance, overcome the difficulties before us; go to the most difficult places, go to the front line of production, stand in front of the masses, and work hard together with the broad masses of cadres and the people. Binhai has the huge power of nearly one million people. As long as the county committee leadership is revolutionized, it will be able to change the face of Binhai as soon as possible.

### 后进地区更要看到群众无限力量

　　后进地区更要看到群众无限力量
    为人民，就要相信人民。过去认为灾区没有先进典型，就是不相信人民的表现。实际上滨海人民是有创造精神的，发现、总结、推广这些先进典型经验，就可以使精神变为巨大的物质力量
    焦裕禄同志能在较短时间认识了兰考的客观规律，较快改变了兰考的面貌，根本的原因是他有着深厚的阶级感情，善于活学活用毛主席著作。我到滨海工作的时候，也是怀着一定要改变滨海面貌的雄心的。但是，我在工作中对人的因素重视不够，人的工作没有做好。对机关革命化，特别是县委领导的革命化的重要性，认识不深刻，抓的不紧。事实深刻教育了我，这样，忙忙碌碌，日常工作做得不少，但把突出政治，活学活用毛泽东思想这个纲丢掉了，工作越做越吃力，增产措施推行不开。一九六五年没有完成生产任务，对国家没有什么贡献，还拖住国家的后腿。
    要改造自然，必须认识自然，掌握自然的规律。我到滨海之后，一年多还没有订出改变滨海面貌的切实可行的具体规划。过去自己总认为对滨海的情况基本上是熟悉的，大体上还是有数的，存在骄傲自满情绪，也存在怕苦畏难思想。因此，就没有认真地、系统地下去作调查。平时下乡，也是公社去的多，大队、生产队去的少。跑面时间多，蹲下去调查的少。只有和干部接触了解情况，很少和贫下中农商量问题。特别在抓样板、抓先进典型这个问题上，没有象焦裕禄同志那样，从群众中来，到群众中去，带着深厚的阶级感情，认真总结经验，树本县的标兵。我认为滨海条件差，生产落后，没有什么先进经验可以总结，没有什么好的标兵可以学习。其实，这是错误的，是对“人民群众有无限的创造力”这个根本思想缺乏认识。兰考那样重的灾，那样差的自然条件，还有好的典型、好的样板；滨海虽然也是老灾区，但自然条件与兰考比较起来，要好的多。滨海人民是有革命的创造精神，有许多先进经验可以总结、先进典型可以学习的，问题在于我没有深入群众，深入实际，及时地发现、培养、总结、推广，没有能够发挥先进经验、先进典型对全县生产上的推动作用。
    以点带面，一般号召和个别指导相结合，这是毛主席教导我们必须采取的领导方法。我到滨海后，不象焦裕禄同志那样坚持战斗在生产第一线，而是满足于一般号召，缺乏个别指导。在工作中没有坚持蹲点创样板，而是看点、跑点；没有坚持劳动、工作在第一线，而是蹲在机关多，深入实际少，对滨海近百万人民缺乏深厚的阶级感情。我出身于一个贫农家庭，但参加工作以来，蹲机关的时间比较长，阶级感情逐渐淡薄了，对广大群众，特别是贫下中农的困难，缺乏具体的了解，对他们迫切要求改变生产生活面貌的心情，缺乏深切的体会。
    最近几天，广大干部在学习当中，有同志反映：我们滨海要有象焦裕禄同志这样的县委书记多好啊！听了这些话，深深感到这是群众对我的要求，对我的鞭策。
    现在，省委、地委对改变滨海面貌非常关怀，加强了对我们的领导；改变滨海面貌的路子也比较清楚了。实现这个改变面貌的规划，还要进行艰苦的工作，艰苦的劳动。
    在这场艰巨的斗争中，必须认真地抓好县委思想革命化，领导革命化，首先是我要革命化，立志学习焦裕禄同志那样当好“班长”，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，改造思想，改进领导，改变作风，一心为革命，一心为人民。为人民，要相信人民，依靠人民，坚持自力更生，克服我们面前的困难；到最艰苦的地方去，到生产第一线去，站在群众的前面，和广大干部群众一起艰苦奋斗。滨海有近百万人民群众的巨大力量，只要县委领导革命化，是能够尽快地改变面貌的。
