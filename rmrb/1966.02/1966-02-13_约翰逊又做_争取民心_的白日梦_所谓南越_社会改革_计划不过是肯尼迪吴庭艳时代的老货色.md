    Johnson Daydreams Again About "Winning Hearts and Minds"
    The So-called South Vietnam "Social Reform" Plan is Just Old Stuff from the Kennedy-Ngo Dinh Diem Era
    (Xinhua News Agency, February 12th) A reporter from this agency reports: The Honolulu Conference was a meeting filled with the smell of gunpowder. While plotting to expand the war, U.S. President Johnson also trotted out a deceptive "social reform" plan, claiming that he would not only win the war militarily but also win a "hearts and minds" war politically. Johnson boasted about his "masterpiece" in an attempt to divert attention and salvage the inevitable defeat of U.S. imperialism in the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The content of this "social reform" plan promoted by Johnson is varied and includes: drafting a "democratic constitution," forming a "government" through "free elections"; strengthening the "rural construction program," carrying out "land reform," popularizing education, and eliminating hunger and disease; "combating inflation," "stabilizing the economy," and "increasing grain production," and so on. However, it is nothing new. This plan is the same as the "Staley Plan" formulated by Washington three and a half years ago during the Kennedy-Ngo Dinh Diem era, which aimed to establish "dense areas" and "strategic hamlets." At that time, the U.S. side boasted that this aggressive plan, including military, economic, and cultural aspects, would "restore order and tranquility [to South Vietnam] within eighteen months." However, under the iron fists of the South Vietnamese army and people, the "Staley Plan" was completely crushed.
    Like the dreams of the U.S. and its puppets three and a half years ago, the "social reform" plan that Johnson is preparing to implement in South Vietnam is a "political pacification" plan predicated on "military suppression." Without military victories, without a foothold for the invaders, there is no question of strengthening political control and deceptive measures to win people's hearts. This is something that the Americans and the South Vietnamese puppets themselves cannot deny. A Honolulu dispatch from United Press International on the 8th stated: "Both sides [referring to the U.S.-puppet group] agreed that without definite military progress, it would be difficult for the rural construction program to achieve widespread results."
    Reports from Western news agencies indicate that Johnson's plan has three steps: first, "U.S. and South Vietnamese forces clear the communists from an area"; second, the puppet "local forces" take over "security work"; and finally, U.S. and puppet "technicians enter the area" to implement the so-called "rural construction program." That is to say, the "rural construction program" that the U.S. is implementing in South Vietnam must first be paved by expanding military operations. However, the 200,000 U.S. invading troops are being beaten everywhere in South Vietnam today, and their territory is shrinking. Even if another 200,000 are added, it will only lead to heavier casualties and more miserable defeats. This dooms Johnson's pacification plan in South Vietnam, which is touted as "social reform," to be nothing more than a castle in the air, empty talk on paper. Nguyen Duc Thang, the puppet South Vietnamese "Minister of Rural Construction," said at a press conference in Honolulu that "it may take five or six years to completely pacify every province in South Vietnam." This is, of course, also wishful thinking. South Vietnam belongs to the South Vietnamese people. The "complete pacification" of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will ultimately lead to their own "complete annihilation."
    Johnson's trickery cannot deceive others, and it is difficult to deceive his own people. U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright recently questioned Bell, the head of the "Foreign Aid" program, who was testifying, expressing doubt about the effectiveness of the large amount of money the U.S. government has invested in South Vietnam. He even bluntly pointed out that the financial aid the U.S. gave to the Saigon puppets (which has exceeded $3 billion since 1954) "has been widely embezzled by Saigon government officials." He demanded that the government provide evidence to show that the Saigon puppet regime is "supported by the people" and prove that "the territory controlled by the Viet Cong is smaller than it was a year, two years, or three years ago." Under questioning, Bell had to admit that in rural areas, the U.S. "foreign aid program" "has not made sufficient progress in the past few years."
    The Johnson administration is sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of aggression against Vietnam. Such loudly touted "psychological warfare" and "political warfare" tricks are of no help to it. "Winning hearts and minds" is just a daydream, only exposing the death throes of the U.S. aggressors.

### 约翰逊又做“争取民心”的白日梦  所谓南越“社会改革”计划不过是肯尼迪吴庭艳时代的老货色

    约翰逊又做“争取民心”的白日梦
    所谓南越“社会改革”计划不过是肯尼迪吴庭艳时代的老货色
    据新华社十二日讯　本社记者报道：檀香山会议是一个充满火药味的会议。在策划扩大战争的同时，美国总统约翰逊又端出了一个骗人的“社会改革”计划，扬言不但要在军事上打赢这场战争，而且要在政治上打赢一场“争取民心”的战争。约翰逊大肆吹嘘他的“杰作”，妄图转移视线，挽救美帝国主义在侵越战争中必败的命运。
    约翰逊推销的这个“社会改革”计划的内容五花八门，计有：制订一个“民主宪法”、通过“自由选举”产生“政府”；加强“乡村建设计划”，进行“土地改革”、普及教育和消灭饥饿、疾病；“打击通货膨胀”、“稳定经济”、“提高粮食产量”等等。但是，它并不是什么新鲜玩艺。这个计划同三年半以前肯尼迪—吴庭艳时代华盛顿拟订的建立“稠密区”和“战略村”的“斯特利计划”是一类货色。在当时，美国方面吹牛说，这个包括军事、经济和文化各方面的侵略计划将“在十八个月内恢复（南越）秩序与安宁”。但是，在南越军民的铁拳打击之下，“斯特利计划”被彻底粉碎了。
    同三年半以前美伪的梦想一样，约翰逊准备在南越推行的“社会改革”计划，是以“军事清剿”为前提的“政治绥靖”计划。没有军事上的胜利，没有侵略者的立足点，就谈不到什么加强政治控制和收买人心的欺骗措施。这一点是美国人和南越傀儡自己也不能不承认的。合众国际社八日的一条檀香山消息说：“双方（指美伪集团）一致认为，没有肯定的军事进展，要使农村建设计划取得广泛效果是困难的。”
    西方通讯社的报道说明，约翰逊的这套计划有三步曲；第一步，由“美国和南越部队在一个地区内肃清共产党人”；第二步，由伪“地方部队”接管“安全工作”；最后，由美伪“技术人员进入该地区”，推行所谓“乡村建设计划”。这就是说，美国在南越推行的“乡村建设计划”首先必须以扩大军事行动来开道。但是，二十万美国侵略军今天在南越到处挨打，地盘越来越小。再增加二十万，也只能是伤亡更重、失败更惨。这就注定了约翰逊标榜“社会改革”的这套南越绥靖计划只能是空中楼阁，纸上谈兵。南越伪政权“农村建设部长”阮德胜在檀香山的记者招待会上说，“要彻底绥靖南越每个省可能需要五六年”。这当然也是痴心妄想。南越是南越人民的，美帝国主义及其走狗的“彻底绥靖”到头来只能是他们自己的“彻底消灭”。
    约翰逊这套玩艺儿骗别人骗不了，骗自己人也很困难。美国参议院外交委员会主席富布赖特最近在质问出席作证的“对外援助”计划负责人贝尔时，对美国政府在南越投入的大量金钱的实效表示怀疑。他甚至直截了当地指出，美国给西贡傀儡的财政援助（自一九五四年以来已经超过三十亿美元），“被西贡政府人士广泛地贪污了”。他要政府拿出证据来表明西贡伪政权是“得到人民支持”的，并且证明“越共控制的领土比一年、二年或三年前为少”。在追问之下，贝尔不得不承认，在农村里，美国的“援外计划”“在过去几年内并没有取得足够的进展”。
    约翰逊政府正在侵略越南的泥淖里越陷越深。如此大吹大擂的“心理战”、“政治战”的把戏，丝毫也帮不了它的忙。“争取民心”只不过是白日作梦，徒然暴露出美国侵略者的末路挣扎罢了。
