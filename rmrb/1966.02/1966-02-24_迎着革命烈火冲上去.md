　　　　Rushing Forward into the Revolutionary Fire
　　　　Beijing Jing Shan School Senior High Student Wang Xiaoling
    After reading "The Song of Ouyang Hai," I was deeply moved by the heroic image of Ouyang Hai. Ouyang Hai, through his twenty-three years of heroic life, tells us how a person should live and fight: "Live to fight for the cause of the Party; die to dedicate oneself to the cause of the Party." Ouyang Hai's life was a life of struggle; each of our lives should also be a revolutionary life like this. We must follow Ouyang Hai's path, like him, without any selfish desires, handing everything over to the Party; like him, with a high sense of class responsibility, shouldering heavy burdens for the revolution, giving our all.
      "Let's do it, for the people of the world who are still enslaved, for the victory of communism to come sooner, let's do it!" This is Ouyang Hai's resounding battle cry, this is Ouyang Hai's solemn revolutionary oath! Carrying the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people striving for progress, on the railway construction site, Ouyang Hai shouted, "Hold high the revolutionary red flag, let's do it!" fighting tenaciously for the suffering people of the world; with deep feelings for the oppressed class brothers of the world, on the reservoir construction site, he endured the pain of hand burns, working selflessly for the realization of communism.... On the road forward, he was always a charging warrior, wherever he went, he was a locomotive, a battle flag. The carrying team was the most tiring, he squeezed in; to rescue equipment, he was at the front; encountering a fire, he rushed into the flames... Honor pass, difficulty pass, criticism pass, so many passes, so many tests, relying on the armed power of Mao Zedong Thought, relying on his utter loyalty to the revolutionary cause, Ouyang Hai withstood them all, rushed through them all!
    In front of Ouyang Hai, I felt ashamed. How did I treat all this? Meeting with some difficulties, I frowned; being criticized, I was in low spirits. Like me, how can I be like Ouyang Hai, shouldering heavy burdens and being a pioneer for the revolution?
    Now our class is about to graduate. I increasingly feel that I am standing on an invisible battle line, and the closer it gets to graduation, the deeper this feeling becomes. At this moment, various factors are swarming towards me, and all kinds of "ghosts and monsters" will come out to make trouble. It is a time of testing, am I like Ouyang Hai, discarding all personal plans and rushing forward into the flames? Or am I worried about gains and losses, and defeated in front of the test? Ouyang Hai's image is educating and encouraging me to move forward. I must be like him, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and hand my life over to the Party to arrange, no matter where I go, I must be like Ouyang Hai, "Hold high the revolutionary red flag, let's do it!"

　　迎着革命烈火冲上去
　　北京景山学校高三学生　王小玲
    读了《欧阳海之歌》以后，深深为欧阳海的英雄形象所感染。欧阳海以他二十三年的英雄历程告诉我们，一个人的一生应当怎样活着，怎样战斗：“活着，为了党的事业战斗；死，为了党的事业而献身。”欧阳海的一生，就是这样战斗的一生，我们每个人的一生，也应当是这样革命的一生。我们要走欧阳海的路，象他那样毫无自私自利之心，把一切交给党；象他那样以高度的阶级责任感，为革命挑重担，豁出自己全部的精力。
      “干吧，为了全世界还被奴役着的人们，为着共产主义胜利早一天来到，干吧！”这是欧阳海嘹亮的战斗口号，这是欧阳海庄严的革命誓言！带着中国人民奋发图强的革命精神，在修建铁路工地上，欧阳海高喊着“高举革命红旗，干吧！”为天下受苦人而顽强地战斗；带着对全世界受压迫的阶级兄弟的深厚感情，在水库工地上，他忍受着手部烧伤的痛苦，为共产主义的实现而忘我地劳动……。在前进的道路上，他从来都是冲锋陷阵的战士，他走到哪里，就是哪里的一个火车头，哪里的一面战斗旗帜。搬运组最累，他挤了进去；抢救器材，他排在前头；路遇失火，他迎着烈火冲了进去……荣誉关，困难关，批评关，多少道关口，多少个考验，凭着毛泽东思想的武装，凭着对革命事业的赤胆忠心，欧阳海都经受住了，冲过去了！
    在欧阳海的面前，我直觉得脸红。我是怎样对待这一切的呢？遇到点困难，就愁眉不展；挨了点批评，就情绪不高。象我这样，怎么能象欧阳海那样为革命挑重担、打先锋呢？
    现在我们这一班快要毕业了。我越来越感到自己是站在一条无形的战线上，离毕业期近一天，这种感觉就深一层。在这种时刻，各种因素都向我拥来，各种“鬼怪”都会钻出来作祟。是考验的时候了，我是象欧阳海那样，丢掉一切个人打算，迎着烈火冲上去？还是患得患失，在考验面前败阵下来？欧阳海的形象正在教育和鼓舞我前进。我一定要象他那样，听毛主席的话，把我这一辈子交给党来安排，不管到哪里，都要象欧阳海那样，“高举革命红旗，干哪！”
