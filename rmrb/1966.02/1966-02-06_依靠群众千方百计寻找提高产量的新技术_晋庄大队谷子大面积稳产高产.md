    Rely on the Masses to Find New Technologies for Increasing Production by Every Possible Means
    Jinzhuang Brigade Achieves Stable and High Yields of Millet Over Large Areas
    (Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th) The Jinzhuang Brigade in Huguan County, located at the foot of the Taihang Mountains, achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of millet last year. This fact has broadened people's horizons and powerfully shattered the "low-yield millet theory."
    The natural conditions of the Jinzhuang Brigade in Jinzhuang Commune, Huguan County, Shanxi Province, are not considered very good. It is located at an altitude of about 1,200 meters, with a frost-free period of about 150 days. The entire brigade does not have a single mu of irrigated land, and all the millet fields are hilly dry land. However, in the past three years, the millet has had consecutive large-scale bumper harvests. In 1965, the entire brigade planted 503 mu of millet, with an average yield of over 643 jin per mu, an increase of 65.4 percent compared to 1962. There were 178.5 mu of land with yields of over 700 jin per mu, and one millet field (6.91 mu) averaged over 920 jin per mu.
    In the struggle to actively strive for high millet yields, the cadres and members of the Jinzhuang Brigade have carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution, trying every possible means to find new technologies for increasing millet yields, and combining local traditional cultivation techniques with advanced experiences from other places, creating a complete set of millet planting experiences. Last year, all brigades in the entire commune promoted the millet planting experience of the Jinzhuang Brigade and achieved significant yield increases.
      "Is millet a high-yield crop or a low-yield crop?" In the winter of 1962, the Jinzhuang Brigade launched a discussion on this issue. When formulating the 1963 production plan, the commune proposed expanding the area of millet fields. The cadres and members of the Jinzhuang Brigade agreed, but they were afraid that the low millet yield would affect the total grain output. How to increase millet yields? Brigade Leader Liu Baoze went to the masses to find solutions. He visited old poor peasant member Yan Zhagen, who told him that millet was not a low-yield crop. He had once planted three mu of millet, plus intercropped black beans, and harvested 750 jin per mu. His millet fields were "strong ridge land" (autumn plowing and fertilization), with 150 dan of sheep manure soil applied per mu, more seedlings were retained, hoeing was timely, and management was meticulous, so he achieved a high yield.
    Liu Baoze found this high-yield model and convened a meeting of production team leaders and old farmers, inviting Yan Zhagen to introduce his millet planting experience and organize everyone to discuss it. Through Yan Zhagen's high millet yield, they found the reasons for low millet yields and methods for high yields. Everyone's confidence in striving for high millet yields was enhanced, and it was decided that the millet field area in 1963 would be expanded from 450 mu in the previous year to 500 mu.
    In that year, 80 percent of the millet in the Jinzhuang Brigade was planted on strong ridge land, with an average of 97 dan of fertilizer applied per mu. The members changed the old habit of "not hoeing seedlings until the millet is a month old," thinned the seedlings early and shallowly hoed, appropriately retaining more seedlings, and preventing seedling shortages. After the autumn of 1963, the actual yield results showed that the total millet output increased by 43.4 percent compared to the previous year, with an average yield of 502.8 jin per mu. In the autumn of that year, Jinzhuang Brigade became one of the millet production pacesetters in southeastern Shanxi.
    In 1964, the Jinzhuang Brigade also learned a lot of advanced millet planting experiences from other places. The sowing area of the improved millet variety "Golden Mace" was expanded, and fertilization and other measures were strengthened. After autumn, the average yield was 591 jin of millet per mu. Fifty mu had an average yield of over 800 jin per mu. From this time on, the Jinzhuang Brigade completely solved the ideological problem of fearing that low millet yields would reduce total grain output.
    With the large-scale stable and high yields of millet, some members and cadres developed the idea of "reaching the peak of production." When discussing the 1965 millet yield increase plan, some said, "A millet yield of 590 jin per mu is already good enough. I have never heard of a millet yield of 600 jin per mu since ancient times." Some said, "The millet yield is already not low. Being able to maintain this number is not bad." The Party branch organized everyone to study advanced units with high millet yields, resolving the idea of reaching the peak of millet yield increases. Then, they tapped the potential for yield increase and continued to carry out technical revolutions. And they adopted some advanced technical measures to strengthen field management. Despite suffering from severe drought last year, the millet of the entire brigade still achieved a bumper harvest.

    依靠群众千方百计寻找提高产量的新技术
    晋庄大队谷子大面积稳产高产
    据新华社太原四日电　太行山下的壶关县晋庄大队去年种谷子，实现了大面积高额丰产。这个事实开拓了人们的眼界，有力地打破了“谷子低产论”。
    山西省壶关县晋庄公社晋庄大队的自然条件不算很好，拔海一千二百米左右，无霜期一百五十天左右，全大队没有一亩水浇地，所有谷田都是丘陵旱地。然而，最近三年，谷子连年大面积丰收。一九六五年，全大队种谷子五百零三亩，平均亩产六百四十三斤以上，比一九六二年增产百分之六十五点四；出现亩产七百斤以上的地块一百七十八亩半，有一块谷田（六亩九分一厘地）平均亩产九百二十斤以上。
    在积极争取谷子高产的斗争中，晋庄大队的干部和社员发扬了不断革命精神，千方百计寻找提高谷子产量的新技术，把当地传统栽培技术与外地先进经验相结合，创造了一整套种谷经验。去年，全公社各个大队推广了晋庄大队的种谷经验，都获得了显著的增产效果。
      “谷子是高产作物还是低产作物？”一九六二年冬季，晋庄大队对这个问题展开了一次讨论。在制定一九六三年生产计划时，公社提出扩大谷田的意见，晋庄大队的干部和社员都同意，只是怕谷子产量低，会影响粮食总产量。怎样把谷子产量提高呢？大队长刘保则到群众中去找办法。他访问老贫农社员阎扎根，阎扎根对他说，谷子不是低产作物，他曾经种三亩谷子，加上间作的黑豆，每亩收了七百五十斤。他的谷田是“壮垄地”（秋耕施肥），每亩上了一百五十担羊粪土，多留些苗，锄搂适时，精细管理，因此获得了高产量。
    刘保则找到了这个高产典型，就召开生产队长和老农会，请阎扎根介绍了他的种谷经验，又组织大家讨论。通过阎扎根谷子高产的事实，又找到了谷子低产的原因和高产的办法，大家对争取谷子高产增强了信心，决定一九六三年的谷田由上一年的四百五十亩扩大到五百亩。
    这一年，晋庄大队的谷子有百分之八十种在壮垄地上，平均每亩施肥九十七担。社员们改变了“谷不满月不锄苗”的旧习惯，早间苗早浅锄，适当多留苗，防止了荒苗。一九六三年秋后实打结果，谷子总产量比上一年增长百分之四十三点四，平均每亩收了五百零二斤八两。这年秋天，晋庄大队成了晋东南谷子生产标兵之一。
    一九六四年，晋庄大队又学到了不少外地种谷先进经验。扩大了良种谷子“金棒锤”的播种面积，加强了施肥等措施。秋后，平均每亩产谷子五百九十一斤。有五十亩平均每亩产量在八百斤以上。从这时候起，晋庄大队彻底解决了怕谷子低产会降低粮食总产量的思想问题。
    谷子大面积稳产高产了，一些社员和干部却产生了“增产到顶”思想。在讨论一九六五年谷子增产计划时，有的说：“谷子亩产量达到五百九十斤也可以了，从古以来没听说过谷子亩产六百斤的。”有的说：“谷子产量已经不低了，能保住这个数也算不坏了。”党支部就组织大家学习谷子高产的先进单位，解决了谷子增产到顶思想。接着，挖增产潜力，继续进行技术革命。并采取了一些先进的技术措施，加强田间管理。尽管去年遭受严重干旱，结果全大队的谷子还是获得了丰收。
