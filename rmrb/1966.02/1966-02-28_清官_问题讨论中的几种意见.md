　　Editor's Note: Currently, in the discussion of Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," many articles touch upon the issue of evaluating "upright officials." Two years ago, academic circles in our country also published several articles on this issue. However, there are still many different opinions. Fundamentally clarifying this issue will help us make appropriate evaluations of Hai Rui and other relevant historical figures. This requires continuing to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and further researching and discussing this issue. We now present a summary of the main opinions in the discussion for reference.

    What is an "upright official"? Have there been "upright officials" in Chinese history?

    What is an "upright official"? Some comrades believe that the "upright officials" of feudal society were those who were politically loyal to the feudal system, ideologically adhered to feudal ethical codes, and economically did not贪 or only slightly贪 take illicit wealth. Someone said that the "清" (qīng, meaning "upright" or "honest") in "upright official" refers to "清廉 (qīnglián, incorruptible), 清正 (qīngzhèng, upright), 清明 (qīngmíng, enlightened)."

    Some comrades understand "upright official" in a broad sense, referring to all officials in history who implemented certain policies considered "progressive" or "reformist," carried out reforms and adopted reform measures, built water conservancy projects to develop production, and even resisted aggression, as "upright officials" or "good officials."

    Have there been "upright officials" in Chinese history? Some people believe that there have never been "upright officials" in history. Their main reasons are: 1. In feudal society, all officials represented the interests of the exploiting class. Although their exploitation of the people varied in degree, no official was not greedy; they could not possibly be spotless. 2. "Upright officials" and "corrupt officials" are political and moral concepts of the feudal landlord class, standards used by the ruling class to divide its internal figures, and not the concepts of the proletariat. We cannot use them as a scale to evaluate historical figures. 3. The feudal ruling class was accustomed to using both deception and suppression to rule the people. In order to adapt to the actual needs of their class, they often consciously beautified and publicized certain officials who were good at using deceptive methods as so-called "benevolent officials," "good officials," and "upright officials" as political models. Therefore, "upright officials" are actually illusions created by the feudal ruling class.

    Others believe that the appearance of "upright officials" in Chinese feudal society is an objective historical fact. The repeated appearance of "upright officials" in our ancient class society and their being valued by various different classes is not purely derived from the ruler's deceptive fabrication, nor is it entirely a product of the masses' illusory ideals, but rather a somewhat beautified actual political phenomenon.

    What are the historical conditions for the emergence of "upright officials" and what is the class attribute of "upright officials"?

    What are the historical conditions for the emergence of "upright officials"? Someone said that "upright officials" are the advocates, supporters, and implementers of the "concession policy" of the feudal ruling class towards the peasants. They were produced because the feudal ruling class implemented the "concession policy."

    Some articles believe that on the one hand, because the feudal state had to deal with the sharp contradictions between the royal family and the powerful families while dealing with the basic class contradictions, it needed some "benevolent officials," harsh officials, and "upright officials" as supplementary forces to the feudal bureaucratic system; on the other hand, due to the influence of Confucianism, some people came out to promote ethical norms and advocate virtuous rule and benevolent governance in certain historical conditions in order to maintain the feudal system, which is what is called "upright officials."

    Some comrades believe that feudal exploitation rights are divided into legal rights and extra-legal rights (or customary rights). The former reflects the long-term and overall interests of the landlord class, while the latter reflects the special and immediate interests of the landlord class. Powerful families and nobles often break through the former for the latter, leading to the intensification of class contradictions. And when sharp class contradictions seriously threaten feudal rule, feudal rule must carry out self-regulation—maintaining legal rights and restricting customary rights in order to extend its life. "Upright officials" are the tools for feudal rule to carry out this self-regulation. Their actions are essentially to maintain legal rights and restrict customary rights.

    What is the class attribute of upright officials? Some people believe that "upright officials" represent the interests of the people. Their reasons are: 1. "Upright officials" stand on the position of the landlord class but also sympathize with the people. They consciously did some good things, reduced the burden on the people, and promoted the development of production. These measures are consistent with the long-term interests of the feudal ruling class, as well as with the current interests of the broad masses of the people, and even do not violate the long-term interests of the peasant class. 2. The struggle of "upright officials" against the powerful is a historically revolutionary matter, a struggle between the bright side and the dark side in history. "Upright officials" are a ray of light in the dark feudal rule, and "upright officials" embody the ideals of the people.

    Many comrades disagree with the above arguments. They believe that feudal officials, whether "upright," "corrupt," "good," or "bad," are, in terms of their class essence, tools of the dictatorship of the landlord class. They firmly stand on the position of the feudal ruling class and never represent the interests of the people. The so-called "love for the people" of "upright officials" is purely deception, and its intention is to exploit the people more and disintegrate the revolution. The interests of two opposing classes can never be consistent. One cannot replace class opposition with the opposition of "upright" and "corrupt," or obliterate the basic contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class in feudal society.

    Some comrades also pointed out that the "love for the people" of "upright officials" is often sincere in their subjectivity. This is because they may be completely unaware of the class interests hidden behind their own views and emotions. One cannot deny the ideological impulse that drives "upright officials" to act. The question is not to stop in front of this ideological impulse, but to further explore how this ideological impulse could have occurred, and what is hidden behind these impulsive forces. If the actions of "upright officials" stem from sympathy, pity, and care for the people, then this sympathy, pity, and care are nothing more than reflecting the landlord class's need for labor and the disguise of cruel exploitation.

    What is the historical role of "upright officials"?

    The discussion universally touched upon the historical role of "upright officials." Some people believe that although "upright officials" can only partially and temporarily promote production development, their practice of virtuous rule and benevolent governance does, to a certain extent, reduce the exploitation and oppression of peasants and is conducive to production. Although "upright officials" have a paralyzing effect on peasant struggles, their suppression of the powerful does strike at the most reactionary part of the landlord class and is conducive to peasant struggles. Therefore, on the whole, the positive role of "upright officials" outweighs the negative role.

    Different from the above view, some comrades believe that the actions of "upright officials" are all aimed at increasing the income of the feudal dynasty, preventing peasant uprisings, and consolidating the reactionary relations of production. They are only beneficial to the landlord class and cannot be said to be of any benefit to the peasants, nor can they be said to promote production development or advance history.

    Some people say that the historical role of "upright officials" is only to beautify the feudal regime, promote feudal morality, spread superstition about "the imperial court and the king's law," and induce the people to be stable slaves, so they will not pick up knives to make revolution. "Upright officials" are nothing more than useful tools of the dictatorship of the feudal landlord class, loyal maintainers of the feudal order, defenders of the four ropes of political power, clan power, religious power, and male power, and trump cards for deceiving the peasants.

    Another view is that there are several different types of "upright officials" under different historical conditions: In the rising period of the feudal dynasty, "upright officials" are the capable assistants of "wise rulers and virtuous ministers." When feudal rule has become corrupt but peasant wars have not yet broken out on a large scale, "upright officials" limit the illegal behavior of powerful families and nobles to a certain extent, and are tools for the self-regulation of the feudal system. The anti-powerful struggles of "upright officials" play a role in exposing the feudal system under certain conditions. However, "upright officials" always end in failure, and the failure of "upright officials" shatters the people's illusions about the rulers, which helps the occurrence of revolution. When the feudal ruling order collapses and peasant revolutions are like a violent storm, "upright officials" are swindlers and executioners who deal with peasant uprisings.

    Is there a difference between "upright officials" and corrupt officials?

    Some comrades raised the question of whether there is a difference between "upright officials" and corrupt officials. Some people believe that there are irreconcilable contradictions between "upright officials" and powerful tyrants and corrupt officials. Corrupt officials are the dregs of the feudal era, and "upright officials" are the essence of the feudal era. If "upright" and "corrupt" are not distinguished, then the ancients will be worthless and history will be a complete darkness.

    Some comrades said that there is no distinction between "upright," "corrupt," "good," and "bad" feudal officials. In essence, they are all tools of the feudal ruling class to implement dictatorship over the working people, and they are all executors of exploiting and oppressing peasants. "Upright officials" and corrupt officials are just two different manifestations of feudal politics. In the class struggle, they each have their own characteristics of action. Generally speaking, corrupt officials pursue the immediate interests of individuals and groups of the feudal landlord class, killing the chicken to get the eggs, while "upright officials" focus on the long-term interests of their class, raising chickens to lay eggs. Their differences are by no means class differences, but only differences in the degree of oppression and exploitation, whether heavier or more ruthless, and by no means differences between exploitation and non-exploitation, oppression and non-oppression. Only by first recognizing the same essence of "upright officials" and corrupt officials, and then looking at their differences, is it meaningful and will not replace the contradiction between "upright officials" and corrupt officials with the contradiction between the peasant class and the landlord class.

    Some other comrades believe that it is unscientific to propose the proposition of who is better or worse between "upright officials" and corrupt officials. From a fundamental standpoint, both "upright officials" and corrupt officials are opposed to the people. Everything that "upright officials" do cannot exceed the scope permitted by feudal rule. When exposing the reactionary essence and deceptive role of "upright officials," one must never draw the conclusion that corrupt officials are better than "upright officials" and that atrocities can promote the people's struggle based on the deduction of formal logic. Because this statement does not analyze the problem from a class perspective, and in essence, it regards all violence as a source of progress, attributes the driving force of social development to the ruling class, and regards the darkest forces in history as the internal driving force for the disintegration of feudal society itself.

    How should "upright officials" be evaluated?

    Some people believe that the evaluation of "upright officials" should be based on the opinions of the majority of people at the time and place. Under feudal rule, the broad masses of people yearned for a relatively clear, lenient, and honest government, and therefore supported "upright officials" who could reduce the burden on the people and redress the people's grievances. "Upright officials" embody the ideals of the people, and the people give identification, called "Qingtian" (青天, "blue sky," meaning a just and impartial official). "Upright officials" should be affirmed and commemorated in history, and in some respects, they are still figures worth learning from today. Praising "upright officials" is a tradition of the Chinese people, and denying "upright officials" will not pass among the people.

    Some people say that there were no "upright officials" "supported" by the people in feudal society. The people have never praised those so-called "upright officials." The title of "upright official" was not identified by the peasants, but was added by landlord class literati and historians pretending to be peasants. These titles do not represent the opinions of the peasants at the time, or even the general public opinion at the time. The people's identification of these so-called "upright officials" is "Three years of a Qing magistrate, one hundred thousand taels of silver." We should completely deny these so-called "upright officials" today.

    Some other comrades pointed out that only with a historical materialist point of view can a correct evaluation of "upright officials" be made. In feudal society, when the people were not yet awakened, had not yet realized their own strength, and had not yet taken action to resist feudal oppression, some of them may have had illusions about political phenomena such as "upright officials." This is a backward, weak, passive, and conservative illusion. If we today follow behind the "majority" of feudal bureaucrats and scholar-officials of that time and praise "upright officials," it will play the role of spiritual opium,麻醉 the revolutionary fighting spirit of the masses. Our task today should be to use the weapon of Marxist class analysis to expose the heavy fog that the feudal ruling class has decorated on "upright officials," eliminate those backward, weak, passive, and conservative illusions left over from the past, and restore them to their original appearance and give them a fair historical evaluation.

### “清官”问题讨论中的几种意见

　　“清官”问题讨论中的几种意见
    编者按：　目前在讨论吴晗同志的《海瑞罢官》中，许多文章涉及“清官”的评价问题。两年前，我国学术界也曾就这个问题发表过若干文章。但是，至今还有许多不同的意见。从根本上弄清这个问题，有助于我们对海瑞和其他有关历史人物作出恰当的评价。这就需要继续贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，对这个问题展开进一步的研究和讨论。现将讨论中的各种主要意见综述于后，以供参考。
    什么是“清官”？中国历史上有没有“清官”？
    什么是“清官”？有些同志认为：封建社会的“清官”，就是政治上忠于封建制度，思想上恪守封建纲常道德，经济上不贪或者少贪非分之财。有人说：“清官”的“清”，是指“清廉、清正、清明”。
    有的同志对“清官”作广义的理解，把历史上凡是执行某些被认为是“进步的”、“改良的”政策的，实行变法和采取改革措施的，兴修水利发展生产的，以至抗击侵略的官吏，都称做“清官”、“好官”。
    中国历史上有没有“清官”？一些人认为，历史上根本没有“清官”。他们的主要理由是：一、在封建社会里，所有官吏都是代表剥削阶级利益的。他们对人民的剥削虽有程度的不同，但无官不贪，他们不可能一尘不染。二、“清官”和“贪官”是封建地主阶级的政治观念和道德观念，是统治阶级用来划分其内部人物的标准，而不是无产阶级的观念。我们不能拿它作为评价历史人物的尺度。三、封建统治阶级惯于使用欺骗和镇压两手来统治人民。为了适应本阶级的实际需要，他们往往把某些善于使用欺骗手法的官吏，有意识地美化、宣扬成所谓“循吏”、“良吏”和“清官”，当作政治标本。因此，“清官”实际上是封建统治阶级制造出来的假象。
    另一些人认为：在中国封建社会中出现的“清官”，是一个客观历史事实。“清官”在我国古代阶级社会中一再出现，并被各个不同阶级所重视，这既不纯粹出自统治者欺骗性的虚构，也不完全是人民群众虚幻理想的产物，而是多少被美化了的实际政治现象。
    产生“清官”的历史条件和“清官”的阶级属性是什么？
    产生“清官”的历史条件是什么？有人说：“清官”是封建统治阶级对农民实行“让步政策”的倡导者、拥护者和执行者。他们是由于封建统治阶级实行“让步政策”而产生的。
    有的文章认为：一方面是由于封建国家在应付基本阶级矛盾的同时，还要应付王室同豪强之间的尖锐矛盾，需要一些“循吏”、酷吏、“清官”作为封建官僚制度的补充力量；另一方面是由于儒家思想的影响，有些人在一定的历史条件下，出而恢张伦常礼教，宣扬德化仁政，以维护封建制度，此即所谓“清官”。
    有些同志认为：封建剥削权利分裂为法定权利和法外权利（或习惯权利）。前者体现地主阶级长远的、整体的利益，后者体现地主阶级特殊的、眼前的利益。豪强权贵常为了后者而肆意突破前者，以致激起阶级矛盾的尖锐化。而当尖锐的阶级矛盾严重威胁封建统治时，封建统治必须进行自我调节——维护法定权利，限制习惯权利，以求延续自己的寿命。“清官”就是封建统治进行这种自我调节的工具。他们的所作所为，实质上都是为了维护法定权利，限制习惯权利。
    清官的阶级属性是什么？有些人认为，“清官”是代表人民利益的。他们的理由是：一、“清官”既站在地主阶级立场上，又同情人民。他们有意识地办了一些好事，减轻了人民的负担，促进了生产的发展。这些措施既同封建统治阶级的长远利益一致，又同广大人民的当前利益一致，甚至也不违背农民阶级的长远利益。二、“清官”的反权贵斗争是历史上具有革命意义的事情，是历史上光明面同黑暗面的斗争。“清官”是封建黑暗统治中的一线光明，“清官”体现了人民的理想。
    许多同志不同意上述论点。他们认为：封建官吏，无论“清”、“贪”、“好”、“坏”，就其阶级本质来看，都是地主阶级专政的工具，他们坚决站在封建统治阶级的立场上，绝不代表人民的利益。“清官”所谓的“爱民”纯粹是欺骗，其用意在于更多地剥削人民并瓦解革命。两个对立阶级的利益绝不可能一致。不能以清、贪的对立来代替阶级的对立，抹煞封建社会农民阶级与地主阶级的基本矛盾。
    也有的同志指出：“清官”的“爱民”，在主观上不乏真诚，这是由于他们对掩盖在自己的观点、情感后面的阶级利益可能毫无觉察的缘故。不能否认促使“清官”行动起来的这种观念冲动力，问题在于不应该停止在这种观念冲动力前面，而应该进一步探究这种观念冲动力怎么可能发生，隐藏在这些冲动力量后面的是什么。如果说“清官”的所作所为是出于对人民的同情、怜悯和爱护，那么这种同情、怜悯和爱护无非是反映了地主阶级对劳动人手的需要和对残酷剥削的伪装。
    “清官”的历史作用是什么？
    讨论中普遍论及“清官”的历史作用是什么。有人认为：虽然“清官”只能局部地、暂时地促进生产发展，但是他们实行德治、仁政，毕竟在一定程度上减轻了对农民的剥削和压迫，有利于生产。虽然“清官”对农民斗争起有麻痹作用，但是他们压抑豪强，毕竟打击了地主阶级最反动的部分，有利于农民斗争。因此总的说来，“清官”的积极作用大于消极作用。
    与上述意见不同，有些同志认为：“清官”的所作所为，都是为了增加封建王朝的收入，防止农民起义，巩固反动的生产关系，只是对地主阶级有利，根本谈不上对农民有什么好处，也谈不上促进生产发展，推动历史前进。
    有的人说，“清官”的历史作用只是：美化封建政权，宣扬封建道德，散布对于“朝廷王法”的迷信，诱使人民做稳奴隶，不致拿起刀来闹革命。“清官”不过是封建地主阶级专政的有利工具，封建秩序的忠实维护者，政权、族权、神权、夫权四大绳索的卫道人，欺骗农民的王牌。
    还有一种意见认为，在不同的历史条件下，有几种不同的“清官”类型：在封建王朝上升时期，“清官”是“圣君贤相”的得力助手。在封建统治已趋腐烂、而农民战争尚未大规模展开时，“清官”在一定程度上限制了豪强权贵的不法行为，是封建制度的自我调节工具。“清官”的反豪强斗争在一定条件下，起了揭露封建制度的作用。但是“清官”从来是以失败告终的，“清官”的失败使人民对统治者的幻想破灭，有助于革命的发生。当封建统治秩序土崩瓦解、农民革命已如疾风暴雨时，“清官”则是对付农民起义的骗子和屠夫。
    “清官”和贪官有没有区别？
    有些同志提出，“清官”和贪官有没有区别？有的人认为：“清官”同豪强恶霸、贪官污吏有着不可调和的矛盾。贪官是封建时代的糟粕，“清官”是封建时代的精华。如果清、贪不分，则古人将一无是处，历史将成为漆黑一团。
    有些同志说：封建官吏没有清、贪、好、坏之分，本质上都是封建统治阶级对劳动人民实行专政的工具，都是剥削、压迫农民的执行人。“清官”和贪官，只是封建政治的两种不同表象，在阶级斗争中，他们各有自己的行动特点罢了。一般说来，贪官追求封建地主阶级个人和集团的眼前利益，杀鸡取卵“清官”则着眼于本阶级的长远利益，养鸡生蛋。他们的区别绝非阶级的区别，只是压迫、剥削的重或更重、狠或更狠的区别，绝非剥削或不剥削、压迫或不压迫的区别。只有首先认识“清官”、贪官的相同本质，再看他们的区别，才有意义，才不致把“清官”同贪官的矛盾代替农民阶级同地主阶级的矛盾。
    另外一些同志认为提出“清官”与贪官谁好谁坏，这个命题就是不科学的。从根本立场上看，“清官”和贪官都是同人民对立的。“清官”的一切作为不可能超出封建统治所许可的范围。当揭露“清官”的反动本质和欺骗作用时，绝不能根据形式逻辑的推论，得出贪官污吏比“清官”好，暴行可以促进人民斗争的结论。因为这一说法不是从阶级观点分析问题，并且实质上把一切暴力都当作了进步的源泉，把社会发展的动力归之于统治阶级，把历史上最黑暗的势力看作封建社会自己瓦解的内在动力。
    应该怎样评价“清官”？
    有人认为：评价“清官”应该根据当时当地大多数人的意见。在封建统治下，广大人民向往比较清明、宽大、廉洁的政治，因而拥护能减轻人民负担、伸雪人民冤枉的“清官”。“清官”体现了人民的理想，人民给予鉴定，叫做“青天”。“清官”在历史上应该是被肯定的、值得纪念的，在某些方面，还是值得今天学习的人物。歌颂“清官”是中国人民的传统，否定“清官”在人民中是通不过的。
    有些人说：封建社会根本没有被人民“拥护”的“清官”。人民从来不赞扬那些所谓的“清官”。“清官”这一称号不是农民鉴定的，而是地主阶级文人史家冒充农民给加上的。这些称号不代表当时农民的意见，甚至不代表当时的一般舆论。人民对这些所谓“清官”的鉴定是“三年清知府，十万雪花银”。我们今天对于这些所谓“清官”，应该全盘否定。
    另外一些同志指出：只有以历史唯物主义的观点，才能对“清官”作出正确的评价。在封建社会，当人民还没有觉悟，还没有意识到自己的力量，还没有行动起来反抗封建压迫的时候，其中一部分人可能对“清官”之类的政治现象存在幻想。这是一种落后、软弱、消极、保守的幻想。如果我们今天跟在“当时当地大多数”封建官僚和士大夫后面对“清官”进行歌颂，那是起了麻醉人民群众革命斗志的精神鸦片烟的作用。我们今天的任务应该是用马克思主义阶级分析的武器，揭穿封建统治阶级装潢在“清官”身上的重重迷雾，消除那些过去历史上遗留下来的落后、软弱、消极和保守的幻想，还他们以本来面目，给予恰如其分的历史评价。
