　　“Grasping the truth, one is invincible.” This is a very deep understanding we have gained from our long-term revolutionary and construction practice.

　　The Red Thunder Youth Group of the Shanghai Synthetic Fiber Research Institute, in a short period of time, conquered a fortress of new synthetic fiber that some veteran experts didn't even dare to touch. What did they rely on to be so indestructible and all-conquering? Or, in other words, what did they rely on to be so invincible? It was on grasping the truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

　　“We have no data, no equipment, no experience, and no experts, but we have the most fundamental and most advantageous condition—Mao Zedong Thought. With this, other conditions will gradually arise.” The comrades of the Red Thunder Youth Group are right. Spirit transforms into matter. With the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought, the things they didn't have—data, equipment, experience, experts, etc.—truly gradually arose. This new type of synthetic fiber that our country didn't have also arose from their hands.

　　Mao Zedong Thought teaches people to be brave. These young people, in order to polymerize monomers into spinning materials, conducted more than 500 consecutive experiments. Not only were there no clues, but they became increasingly confused. Some people became anxious, and some wavered. What to do? Study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. Sure enough, studying was effective. “The older generation learned war from war. Our generation must learn science from scientific experiments.” Understanding the truth makes people brave. Not bowing before difficulties, not being discouraged by failures, in this way, they no longer doubted "when the river ends and the mountains are exhausted" entering a maze, but felt that "beyond the dark willows and bright flowers, there is another village."

　　Mao Zedong Thought teaches people to be smart. These young people, in order to make monomers from raw materials, although they took a series of preventive measures, still could not subdue the poisonous gas. What to do? Study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. Sure enough, studying was effective. The works of Comrade Mao Zedong made them understand that poisonous gas also has a dual nature. Poisonous gas is poisonous, and it harms people when it is emitted; poisonous gas is useful, and it can benefit people when it is recovered. Understanding the truth makes people smart. They finally found a way to recover the poisonous gas, and from not being afraid of poisonous gas, they subdued the poisonous gas.

　　Being both brave and smart, having both revolutionary spirit and a scientific attitude, this can generate the great power of invincibility that we are talking about.

　　At present, some scientific and technical personnel still do not quite understand the principle that Mao Zedong Thought can guide scientific experiments. They say: “Flipping through Chairman Mao's works, you can't find a process route or a calculation formula.” In Comrade Mao Zedong's works, you can't indeed find any process route or any calculation formula. However, in Comrade Mao Zedong's works, there is the "route" to find a process route and the "formula" to find a calculation formula, which is the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of guiding the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experiment. As long as we grasp the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought, and at the same time promote the spirit of hard work and diligent research, we will be able to be invincible in the field of science and technology, and we will be able to solve all the problems that need to be solved more quickly.

　　Mao Zedong Thought is our most fundamental weapon for conquering the fortresses of science and technology. As long as we grasp Mao Zedong Thought, not only can the Red Thunder Youth Group successfully trial-produce new synthetic fibers, but any group studying this issue can also successfully trial-produce new synthetic fibers. As long as we grasp Mao Zedong Thought, we can not only produce new synthetic fibers, but we can also produce any other cutting-edge products. This is the principle of Mao Zedong Thought commanding everything, and this is the principle of grasping the truth and being invincible.

　　The Red Thunder Youth Group has a fierce determination to explore the mysteries of science, primarily because they have a fierce determination to creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. They consciously study and consciously apply it. They study it flexibly and apply it flexibly. Studying is entirely for the sake of application, and the application is so solid, powerful, and problem-solving. Due to the creative study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, the anxious calmed down, the wavering became firm, the confused became smart, and the timid became brave. Difficulties turned into smoothness, and failures turned into successes, all of which demonstrate the unparalleled power of Mao Zedong Thought.

　　If these young people have any "secrets" in exploring the mysteries of science, then there is only one "secret": frequently, consciously, creatively studying and applying the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought.

### 抓住真理所向披靡

　　抓住真理所向披靡
    “抓住真理，所向披靡”，这是我们在长期的革命和建设实践中得到的非常深切的体会。
    上海合成纤维研究所红雷青年小组，在不很长的时间内，攻下了一座某些老专家碰都不敢碰的新型合成纤维的堡垒。他们凭着什么这样无坚不摧、无攻不克呢？或者说，凭着什么这样所向披靡呢？就是凭着他们抓住了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想这个真理。
    “我们一无资料，二无设备，三无经验，四无专家，但是，我们却有一个最根本最有利的条件——毛泽东思想。有了这一条，其他的条件都会逐步地有起来。”红雷青年小组的同志们说得很对。精神变物质。有了毛泽东思想这个伟大真理，他们没有的东西：资料、设备、经验、专家等等，真个逐步地有起来了。我国没有的这种新型合成纤维，也从他们手中有起来了。
    毛泽东思想教人勇敢。这些青年人，为了把单体聚合成纺丝材料，连续试验五百多次，不但毫无眉目，甚至越来越糊涂了。有人焦急了，有人动摇了。怎么办呢？学习毛泽东同志著作。果然一学就灵。“老一辈从战争中学会了战争。我们这一辈，要从科学实验中学会科学实验。”懂得了真理，人就变得勇敢起来。在困难前不低头，在失败时不气馁，这样，他们就不再怀疑“山穷水尽”走入迷宫，而是觉得“柳暗花明”别有天地了。
    毛泽东思想教人聪明。这些青年人，为了把原料制成单体，虽然采取了一系列预防措施，仍然无法制服毒气。怎么办呢？学习毛泽东同志著作。果然一学就灵。毛泽东同志著作使他们懂得了毒气也有两重性。毒气有毒，散发出来要害人；毒气有用，回收以后能利人。懂得了真理，人就变得聪明起来。他们终于找到了回收毒气的办法，由不怕毒气进而制服了毒气。
    又勇敢，又聪明，又有革命精神，又有科学态度，这就能产生我们所说的所向披靡的伟大力量。
    目前，有些科学技术人员，还不大懂得毛泽东思想可以指导科学实验这个道理。他们说：“翻遍毛主席著作，找不到一条工艺路线，一条计算公式。”在毛泽东同志著作中，确实找不到任何工艺路线和任何计算公式。但是，在毛泽东同志著作中，却有找工艺路线的“路线”，找计算公式的“公式”，这就是指导阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的立场、观点和方法。只要掌握了毛泽东思想这一伟大真理，同时发扬了刻苦钻研的精神，我们在科学技术领域中，就能够所向披靡，就能够更快地解决一切需要解决的问题。
    毛泽东思想是我们攻克科学技术堡垒最根本的武器。只要抓住了毛泽东思想，不光红雷青年小组可以试制成功新型合成纤维，任何研究这个问题的小组也可以试制成功新型合成纤维。只要抓住了毛泽东思想，我们不光可以生产出新型合成纤维，也可以生产出任何其他尖端产品。这就是毛泽东思想统帅一切的道理，这也就是抓住真理所向披靡的道理。
    红雷青年小组探索科学奥秘有一股狠劲，首先是因为他们活学活用毛泽东思想有一股狠劲。他们自觉地学、自觉地用。学得活，用得活。学完全为了用，而且用得如此扎实有力，如此解决问题。由于活学活用毛泽东思想，焦急的冷静了，动摇的坚定了，糊涂的聪明了，畏缩的勇敢了。困难转为顺利，失败化为成功，在在显示毛泽东思想的无比威力。
    如果说这些青年人在探索科学奥秘中有什么“奥秘”的话，那末，只有一个“奥秘”：经常地自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想这个伟大真理。
