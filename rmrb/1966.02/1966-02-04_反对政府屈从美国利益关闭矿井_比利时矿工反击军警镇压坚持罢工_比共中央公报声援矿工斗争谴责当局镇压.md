    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency in Brussels on February 2nd: Ignoring the bloody suppression by the military and police, striking miners in the Limburg coal region of northeastern Belgium continued their strikes and demonstrations on the 1st and 2nd, opposing the government's capitulation to US interests and the closure of mines. They demand that the government ban the import of coal from the United States and West Germany, and are determined to strike until they receive guarantees that the mines will not be closed.

    During the miners' demonstration on January 31st, the military and police dispatched by the Belgian government opened fire, killing two demonstrators and wounding many more.

    On the 1st, the government sent an additional three thousand troops, including a paratrooper assault team, to the strike area to intensify the suppression of miners holding rallies and demonstrations, as well as students supporting the miners.

    On the 1st, near the Winterslag coal mine, striking miners fought the military and police with bricks and stones. The army used tear gas and water cannons. In the evening, the army also opened fire on demonstrators, wounding a woman. On the evening of the 2nd, demonstrators overturned a car, disregarding the suppression by baton-wielding gendarmes.

    In Opglabbeek, demonstrators clashed with police several times. Demonstrators burned police barricades. Dozens of demonstrators were arrested in these clashes; the number of dead and wounded was not announced.

    The Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party issued a communiqué, fully supporting the just struggle of the Limburg miners, strongly condemning the government for sending military and police to brutally suppress the miners' strikes and demonstrations, and for the atrocities of opening fire, killing and wounding many people.

    The communiqué demands an end to the policy of suppression and super-exploitation, and opposes the government's policy of capitulation to US imperialism.

    The National Executive Bureau of the Belgian Women's Federation also issued a communiqué on January 31st, expressing great indignation at the inhuman suppression by the gendarmes of the struggle of the workers at the Zwartberg mine.

    The communiqué strongly protested the gendarmes' use of tear gas to suppress demonstrations.

    The communiqué fully supports the miners' struggle against the import of US coal and for the right to employment for miners. It calls on all women to join their husbands and brothers in a common struggle.

    据新华社布鲁塞尔二日电  比利时东北部林堡煤区的罢工矿工不顾军警的血腥镇压，在一日和二日继续举行罢工和示威游行，反对政府屈从美国利益，关闭矿井。他们要求政府禁止进口美国和西德的煤炭，决心罢工到获得不关闭矿井的保证为止。
    在一月三十一日的矿工示威中，比利时政府派出的军警开枪打死了两名示威者，打伤多人。
    一日，政府又往罢工矿区增派三千名军队，包括一支伞兵突击队，对举行集会和示威的矿工以及声援矿工的学生加紧镇压。
    一日，在温特斯拉格煤矿附近，罢工矿工用砖石同军警格斗。军队使用催泪瓦斯和水龙，晚上，军队还向示威群众开枪，打伤一名妇女。二日晚上，示威群众不顾挥舞棍棒的宪兵的镇压，弄翻了一辆汽车。
    在奥普格拉贝克，示威者和警察几次发生冲突。示威者烧掉了警察设立的路障。在这些冲突中，数十名示威者被捕，死伤人数没有宣布。
    比利时共产党中央委员会发表公报，全力支援林堡矿工的正义斗争，强烈谴责政府派军警残酷镇压矿工们的罢工和示威游行，开枪打死打伤多人的暴行。
    公报要求结束镇压政策和超级剥削，反对政府屈从美帝国主义的政策。
    比利时妇女联合会全国执行局一月三十一日也发表公报，对宪兵惨无人道地镇压茨瓦特贝格矿井工人们的斗争表示极大的愤慨。
    公报强烈抗议宪兵使用催泪瓦斯镇压示威游行。
    公报全力支援为了反对进口美国煤炭、争取矿工就业权利而斗争的矿工。号召所有妇女同自己的丈夫和兄弟一起进行共同的斗争。
