    Editor's Note: "Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and fighting for the proletarian revolutionary cause for a lifetime." Comrade Wang Jinxi's words fully demonstrate the spiritual outlook of the Daqing people and the high consciousness of the Chinese working class. Nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Wang Jinxi has a firm political direction, a thorough revolutionary spirit, a fearless fighting style, and a hardworking and simple work style. Comrade Wang Jinxi's growth from an ordinary worker into the "Iron Man" of the working class most powerfully illustrates how strong and powerful a person armed with Mao Zedong Thought is.
    The advanced elements of the working class are thorough revolutionaries. Wang Jinxi's history of working in Daqing is a history of thorough revolution under the leadership of the Party. In the process of building the Daqing Oilfield, Wang Jinxi, together with his many comrades-in-arms, fought against the heavens, fought against the earth, fought against class enemies, and fought against wrong ideas. He was not proud of victories and not discouraged by setbacks. He continued his efforts and marched forward, demonstrating the true nature of a thorough revolutionary.
    "It is not terrible for class struggle to be reflected strongly among the workers and staff, no arduous task is terrible, no harsh environment is terrible, but the most terrible thing is to neglect political leadership." The reason why Wang Jinxi was able to become a thorough revolutionary is that he deeply understood this point and never forgot class and class struggle in everything, and always gave prominence to politics in everything.
    Thorough revolutionaries always take the world as their responsibility, have the motherland in their hearts, have the world in their eyes, adhere to the revolution, and forge ahead courageously. Comrade Wang Jinxi is right in saying: "It is not difficult to fight a few beautiful battles, but to do arduous things for a lifetime, it is necessary to constantly study Chairman Mao's works and constantly transform oneself to be able to do it."
    Reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, in the practice of the three great revolutionary movements, our country has produced thousands upon thousands of heroic figures. Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Jiao Yulu are outstanding representatives of such heroic figures on the military front and the agricultural front; Wang Jinxi is an outstanding representative of such heroic figures on the industrial and transportation front. To learn from heroic figures, we must first learn from their spirit of creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and their spirit of thorough revolution.
    The National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference specially invited Comrade Wang Jinxi, the "Iron Man" of Daqing, to give a report.
    Xinhua News Agency, Sixteenth Dispatch: The National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference held an enlarged meeting in the Great Hall of the People today, and specially invited Comrade Wang Jinxi, a nationally renowned labor model, a representative of advanced figures in national industry and transportation, and the "Iron Man" of Daqing, to give a report entitled "Reading Chairman Mao's Books, Listening to Chairman Mao's Words, and Fighting for the Proletarian Revolutionary Cause for a Lifetime."
    The meeting was presided over by Comrade Tao Lujia.
    Those who listened to Comrade Wang Jinxi's report included all the comrades who participated in the National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference, the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference, and the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region trade union chairmen's conferences, the ministers and political department directors of the central industrial and transportation departments, as well as more than 13,000 workers and staff members from organs, organizations, and industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing.
    After Comrade Wang Jinxi's report, responsible comrades such as Bo Yibo, Yu Qiuli, and Tao Lujia received him and had a conversation with him.
    The victory of Daqing Oilfield is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the Party's General Line, the result of learning from the People's Liberation Army, and the result of the support of fraternal units across the country. I have done a little work for the Party in the battle, and this is entirely due to the Party's cultivation, Chairman Mao's teachings, and the help of the masses. Without the Party and without the masses, what am I as an individual?
    Before liberation, I had never even been out of Yumen. In the early days of liberation, my ideological awareness was very low, my vision was very shallow, "the frog at the bottom of the well only sees a bowl-sized piece of sky," I only knew that I had a bowl of rice to eat and that I should work hard for the Party. After the Party's cultivation and education, I joined the Communist Party of China. Under the education of the Party and Chairman Mao, my class consciousness gradually increased, and I did some work for the Party, but the Party gave me great honor. I have attended the Gansu Provincial Labor Model Conference and the National Conference of Heroes, and visited and studied all over the country. My horizons have broadened, and my mind has opened up a lot. I have learned about many major events at home and abroad.
    "We must rely on Mao Zedong Thought to quickly take down this new oilfield"
    I went to Daqing in March 1960 with a strong determination. When it was just liberated, I thought the Yumen Oil Mine was very big and produced a lot of oil. Later, I heard foreigners say that our country was a "poor oil country," and I was very angry. I didn't believe it. Is oil only buried under their land? Our country is so big, is there no oil? Foreigners also say we are "stupid." I don't believe it. Are only you foreigners smart in the world? The Chinese working class, who have stood up, are the smartest under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao taught us to strive for strength and rely on our own efforts. I thought that it was not enough to be angry, we had to work. We must find more big oilfields, drill more wells, drill wells quickly, drill good wells, and produce more oil to compete with imperialism.
    At the end of 1959, I went to Beijing to attend a meeting. I saw cars running on the street, some with a bag on their back. I asked someone, "What is that thing on top for?" People said that it was because there was no gasoline and they were burning gas. I felt really uncomfortable and anxious when I heard that! Such a big country of ours can't have gasoline for cars! I am an oil worker, and seeing that there is no oil and the country is in such great difficulty, how can I still have the face to ask! I didn't ask any more questions! When it was time to rest, I quietly hid to the side, feeling very awkward. I held my breath again. I am an oil worker, am I just going to watch the imperialists laugh at us? During this meeting, I heard that our country had discovered a large oilfield, and I was so happy that I jumped up. At that time, I went to the leaders of the ministry and applied to work in this new oilfield. At that time, I couldn't wait to fly to Daqing, take down the big oilfield, show it to the imperialists, and throw the hat of oil backwardness into the Pacific Ocean. Chairman Mao said: "A quarter of humanity, the Chinese people, have stood up." The Chinese people who have stood up are fearless of heaven, fearless of earth, fearless of ghosts, and ungodly heroes, and they must take down a big oilfield to win this breath for the Party and the Chinese people.
    After returning to Yumen from the meeting, I heard that revisionism and imperialism were colluding and wanted to strangle us with oil, wanting us to hand over the red flag. Could we do this? Absolutely not! We must rely on Mao Zedong Thought to quickly take down this new oilfield to win glory for the Party and win honor for the people.
    Our team of thirty-three people immediately took the train to Daqing. On the train, I studied "Serving the People" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" with everyone. After studying, we discussed why we participated in the battle. Some comrades said, "Go to drill wells and get oil!" I said, "That's right, but not entirely right." I said we are going to make revolution! Imperialism and revisionism are strangling us on oil. How difficult is it for the country without oil! We must take down this big oilfield, throw off the hat of oil backwardness, and win glory for the people of the whole country.
    "Responsible to the Party, responsible to the country, responsible to future generations, responsible to the working people of the world"
    I deeply realize that: I am a well driller, and there is no pressure in drilling wells, even tofu formations cannot be drilled into, there is no pressure in the mud pump, and underground cuttings cannot be brought up, there is no pressure in the well, and oil cannot be sprayed out, people have no pressure they drift lightly, they cannot do good work. With pressure, the work done is of a high level and high standard and can withstand the inspection of future generations.
    This pressure is not the pressure given by that leader, but the conscious and voluntary pressure of our Chinese working class. A revolutionary must have a sense of responsibility, be responsible to the Party, responsible to the country, responsible to future generations, and responsible to the working people of the world, so they should have pressure. If there is no oil, the country has pressure, and we must consciously share this pressure. General pressure is not enough, we must bear one hundred tons of pressure, one thousand tons of pressure.
    When I arrived in Daqing, that joy made me, who had never shed tears, shed tears of joy. I said excitedly: "This is the big oil sea, this is the big oilfield, open the battlefield, throw off the drilling rig and get to work! This time, the backward oil cap will be thrown into the Pacific Ocean!"
    "Whether you are afraid of hard struggle is a matter of revolution or not"
    We rushed to our destination that day. Without a house, we found a broken horse shed, three broken walls and drafts on all sides, full of horse manure inside. We cleaned it up and thirty-three people squeezed together back to back for the night. A few people who couldn't stand the squeeze hugged a handful of grass and groped in the dark in the middle of the night to find a alley to sleep in. When they woke up the next day, they found that they were still sleeping next to a water well, with ice on the ground. At this time, some comrades were out of energy, sighing and saying, "Can you drill wells in this place? It's freezing cold, there are no pots, pans, or spoons, and there's not even a place to live." I thought this worker was also a good worker. When he came, he raised his fists several times, indicating that he wanted to go to the most difficult place. Now he is wavering. On the other hand, I thought that this place was indeed difficult, not generally difficult. This young man who grew up in the new society never thought it would be so difficult. However, no matter how difficult it is, it is important to get oil. So I asked the instructor: How many years have you been in the People's Liberation Army? What do you do when you encounter so many difficulties in battle? Do you go up or retreat? "I haven't fought a war, but I don't think I can retreat." Instructor Sun Yongchen said: "Absolutely cannot retreat! Even if there is only one person left, we must go up! We must fight against it until we win." Good, our two thoughts are the same. So we studied Chairman Mao's works with this question. Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and it is more difficult." Getting oil is drilling wells in the field, and the derrick cannot be installed in a building or in a city. This was the case in the past, it is the case now, and it will be the case in the future. This is determined by the nature of the work. Now the suffering of a few of us can be exchanged for the happiness of the majority of people and the happiness of future generations. This is the greatest happiness of our oil workers.
    I believe that whether you are afraid of hard struggle is a matter of revolution or not. If you don't struggle hard, you will be greedy for pleasure and you will deteriorate. It is not difficult to fight a few beautiful battles, but to do arduous things for a lifetime, it is necessary to constantly study Chairman Mao's works and constantly transform oneself to be able to do it.
    The drilling rig had not arrived, and we sent people to the station to inquire when the drilling rig would arrive. Some people were leveling the well site and preparing. What I was concerned about was whether the formation in this place was easy to drill and whether the drilling speed was fast. Chairman Mao taught us that "there is no right to speak without investigation," so I went everywhere to understand the formation conditions and drilling speed, and organized the whole team to study "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." The more I studied, the clearer I became. Everyone said: To take down the big oilfield, we will definitely encounter many difficulties, and there will be such and such contradictions. However, the biggest contradiction is that oil cannot meet the needs of the country. If this contradiction is not resolved, imperialism and modern revisionism will use this gap to strangle us and blockade us. It is difficult to go up; it is even more difficult not to go up. There is only one way out, which is to resolutely overcome difficulties and take down the big oilfield at high speed and high standards. Everyone regarded the well site as a battlefield to compete with imperialism and revisionism. Everyone's position is a position to win glory for the Party, the country, and the people. In order to drill more wells and produce more oil, we will go up the mountain of knives and down the sea of fire. As long as it is for the cause of the Party, what is personal life?
    Before long, the drilling rig was transported to the station. At that time, so many drilling teams came "quickly and stubbornly," and there were not enough cranes and tractors. What to do? Wait or go up? I thought of Chairman Mao's teaching: "We are working and fighting to solve difficulties." Yes, revolution has difficulties, and where there are difficulties there is struggle. This is not watching a play, it is not going to a restaurant, drilling wells is revolution, the country is short of oil, so we must get oil, there are difficulties in getting oil, why do we communists not struggle? We immediately held a branch committee meeting, organized everyone to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and mobilized everyone to discuss what to do? Comrades said: We can't wait to make revolution. If there are conditions, we will go up. If there are no conditions, we will create conditions. We will pull the drilling rig to the well site with our shoulders and carry it. Everyone was like a little tiger, using ropes to pull, crowbars to pry, and wooden blocks to pad, inch by inch, foot by foot, to pull the sixty-ton drilling rig to the well site and install it.
    To start drilling, you need water. At that time, the water pipeline was not installed, and there was no water tank truck. What to do? Many people said: Without water, we have to start drilling even if we use basins to carry it. At this time, someone said: "Have you ever seen any country that drills wells by carrying water?" I said: "That's our country! We have to drill wells even if we pee!" In this way, we used buckets, small buckets, and basins to carry more than one hundred tons of water before we started drilling.
    "Difficulty is bullying the weak and fearing the strong. If your thinking is hard, it will become tofu. If you are soft, it will become hard."
    Not long after drilling started, we encountered a leaky layer. Everyone said: How much leaks, how much we carry. After the water in the village wells was carried dry, we ran to a water bubble more than a mile away to break the ice and get water. Finally, we overcame the leaky layer and completed the first well in more than six days. When we saw the oil spraying out, everyone jumped up with joy. Through practice, I deeply realized that: You can't be afraid of difficulties when fighting against nature. Difficulty is bullying the weak and fearing the strong. If your thinking is hard, it will become tofu. If you are soft, it will become hard.
    After drilling the first well, we had to move the derrick, but there were no tractors. All of our employees worked hard to find a way to pull the derrick. While directing the placement of the derrick, a drill pipe rolled down and broke my leg. I fainted. When I woke up, the workers were holding my leg and crying, and the derrick had not been placed yet. I was anxious and said, "If someone is injured in battle, you cry, and the enemy comes and captures you all alive, can you cry?" I sat up and continued to direct the placement, and the workers tore off their shirts to wrap me up. After the derrick was placed, everyone told me to go to the hospital, but I didn't go. This day was "May Day," and the war zone held a ten-thousand-person meeting. I said: "This is the first ten-thousand-person meeting. How can I understand the spirit of the meeting if I don't go, and how can I drill more wells, drill wells faster, and drill wells better. Is the leg important or is getting oil important?" I agreed with everyone that no one was allowed to tell the leader. Everyone found a horse-drawn carriage and sent me there.
    At the ten-thousand-person meeting, the leaders of the work committee praised us, gave me red flowers, let me ride a big horse, asked me to speak, and called on all the staff to learn from me. What are you learning from me? We only drilled one well, and the work committee leaders personally led all of our staff to do it. Without the leadership of the Party and without all the staff, what can I do? I felt uneasy in my heart. At the ten-thousand-person meeting, the work committee proposed to take down the Daqing Oilfield as soon as possible and transport the crude oil out by "June 1" to resolutely fight a great victory. After hearing this call, I forgot about the pain in my leg and rushed back to the team that night to discuss what to do? Everyone said: The next well is the first production well in the war zone. We must strive to transport the crude oil from the first well we drilled to support national construction. It is not enough to have a spirit of hard work and rush forward. Zhang Fei in the Three Kingdoms was also meticulous! We immediately summarized the experience of drilling the first well and made suggestions for drilling the second well.
    Later, the leaders found out about my broken leg and were very concerned about me. They insisted on sending me to the hospital. How can I lie in the hospital! The call of the work committee at the ten-thousand-person meeting, the people of the whole country are eagerly watching us, and I am still in the hospital. How can this be? I sneaked back to participate in the drilling of the second well. I directed the well on crutches. Soon, I finally completed the first production well in the war zone, ensuring the transportation of crude oil on "June 1" to support national construction.
    In February 1961, the brigade was established, and I became the captain of the brigade. Not long after, the leaders instructed us to transfer to the southern line to drill wells. At this time, contradictions arose. A cadre from a team came to me and said: "I have an opinion for you. You came and drilled wells on the southern line. You don't know that the pressure on the southern line is high, and it is easy to have blowouts. The unlucky wells are all on the southern line. We can't go!" I said: "You said that our country wants to drill wells that blow out, and the crude oil blows out with a whirring sound. How great! Why are you afraid of it blowing out?" After our investigation, this was not a problem of one person, but represented the thinking of a part of people. The Party branch held a meeting and, after discussion and analysis, believed that some teams did not know much about the formations in the southern line, had not drilled wells in the southern line, and were afraid of blowouts and inclined wells. It was not clear in their minds. We must first solve the problem of ideological understanding and decide to carry out a big discussion: What does the country drill wells for? What kind of wells do we want to drill? Do we want to drill pressurized wells? Who will drill them? Through the big discussion, the staff improved their understanding and boosted their confidence to dare to struggle and dare to win. The workers said: "What are we afraid of! Our Party and Chairman Mao led the Chinese revolution, using millet and rifles, to build a new China. What is so scary about the high-pressure layer on the southern line!" More than ninety wells were drilled that year.
    "Do it according to Chairman Mao's theory of practice" and "According to our conditions, take our own path"
    Before 1962, the deviation of the well could not exceed five degrees. In 1963, the work committee put forward a high standard of no more than three degrees. The leader of the work committee asked me: "Do you support it or not?" I said: "We resolutely support it. We rely on the Party, rely on all the staff, and do it according to Chairman Mao's theory of practice." When we came back, we organized all the staff to study "On Practice." A technician, when he heard that he wanted to drill straight wells, took out such a thick "foreign" book to read. I asked him strangely: "Why are you always carrying that thing?" He said: "There is an automatic anti-deviation tool on it." I said: "That's great. Can we make this thing now?" He shook his head and said: "Can't make it, can't make it!" I said angrily: "What you said is the same as not saying anything! We can't move foreign boxes. Chairman Mao said that we should rely on our own efforts! We take our own path based on our conditions. What's the use of you always carrying that thing?" According to Chairman Mao's teaching of practice and then practice, we resolutely take our own path. The leaders of the work committee personally organized all the drilling staff to discuss it. At the same time, they organized a combination of some technical cadres and old workers to work while exploring and summarizing experience. We found ways while practicing. In the end, we drilled straight wells with only two degrees of deviation, and later we drilled straight wells with only half a degree of deviation.
    This drilling of straight wells was very educational for me. This was under the direct leadership of the work committee, highlighting politics at all times, and emphasizing the human factor first in everything. All the staff knew the significance of drilling straight wells and mastered the laws of formations and equipment, so they drilled well and quickly. I have drilled a lot of wells in the past. Some wells were drilled well, and some inclined wells were drilled. Why? The main reason is that I didn't highlight politics and didn't grasp people's thoughts. First of all, my thinking was crooked, so I drilled inclined wells. To drill straight wells, first of all, we must have a straight well in our brains, and we must have a high sense of political responsibility; if there is no straight well in our brains, we will not be able to drill straight wells in our lifetime.
    In 1965, the work committee put forward a high standard to drill "three-one" high-quality wells (one day, one drill bit, drill one thousand meters). Some drilling teams wanted to drill but didn't dare to drill, and some people were afraid of losing the benchmark team. I said: I'll drill, I'm not afraid of touching the tiger's butt. You can't be afraid of taking risks when making revolution. If you are scared back before you start, then that's not good. When walking, you have to learn how a child walks. When a child's legs are weak, he falls when he runs, but he gets up and runs again. Today it is soft, but tomorrow it will not be soft; you can't learn how an eighty-year-old man walks. When an old man walks, he falls once, and falls again, and then it's all over. At this time, another team was also drilling "three-one" high-quality wells. The two teams drilled side by side. While I was drilling, I told them about the problems I found. As a result, that team succeeded in drilling, and I drilled the well at an angle of eight degrees. I made a self-criticism at the meeting, saying that the well was drilled at an angle and it was my responsibility, not everyone's responsibility. Your responsibility is to help find the cause. Finally, we summarized eight experiences and drilled six "three-one" high-quality wells in a row.
    Through several years of battle in Daqing, I deeply realized that as long as we do what Chairman Mao says, we can overcome any difficulties. To overcome difficulties, we must first have the confidence and determination to overcome difficulties. We can't just see the difficulties, we must also see the achievements and see the favorable conditions. To overcome difficulties, it is not enough to just talk about it, we must study the difficulties, think of ways to solve the difficulties, and do work. Overcoming a difficulty is a victory, is an improvement, and learns a way to overcome difficulties, and increases one point of revolutionary confidence.
    "To fight against the heavens, fight against the earth, fight against class enemies, and also fight against people's wrong ideas"
    Making revolution is not only about fighting against the heavens, fighting against the earth, fighting against class enemies, but also about fighting against people's wrong ideas. A person's thinking must also have a standard. Some things cannot be thought of, and some things can be thought of openly. If you want to think, you must think about how to take down the big oilfield, how to overcome so many difficulties, how much oil we give to everyone in the country, and think about socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    There was a young worker who was my favorite apprentice. For a while, he couldn't stand the test and was emotional and wanted to go back to Yumen. I found him and said to him sternly: "Do you still remember what you looked like when you first came to Yumen? You didn't have legs in your pants, you had your belly exposed in your clothes, and a pair of shoes was patched and patched and weighed several pounds. Have you forgotten that? I haven't forgotten, I have also worn shoes that weigh several pounds. Now you are wearing a sweater and have a satin quilt on your bed. Where did these come from? They were all given by the Party and by Chairman Mao." He cried straight away. He admitted his mistake and said: "I was wrong, what should I do!" I said: "Work hard. At most, we will sweat more and sleep less. Look at our revolutionary predecessors, who are so old and still run to the grassland to suffer. Why? We should think about it carefully and learn from the old predecessors."
    Loving the Party, loving Chairman Mao, and loving socialism cannot be loving while standing in a house, cannot be loving only by raising fists, and cannot be loving only in words, but must do things. We are well drillers. Getting the well out and getting the oil out is true love. Not doing it is the same as talking nonsense. Loving must be loved forever, so we must always work honestly.
    Once, after drilling footage was completed, the perforation position could not be determined for more than ten hours. If the hole cannot be shot, the family cannot be moved. At that time, there were many wells and few people, and it was difficult to determine the new formation for a while. But I ran anxiously to the geological command post and asked them what they were doing? A comrade said: "What do you do?" I said: "What do I do? I'm here to make trouble for you! If you can't determine it, you can't shoot a hole, you can't move your family, how much time is wasted!" Someone persuaded me and said: "Don't worry, it will take a while to drill a well at most." I felt that the taste was wrong when I heard this. How can you say such a thing! Drilling one less well means one less strength in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism. I jumped up and said: "Why let me delay drilling a well for a while, why not let me drill two more wells? What reason do you have?" The more I said, the more angry I became. I sat on the table and said: "I won't go back tonight. When will you determine it, I will get up and leave." You see, I am a rough old man. Now that I think about it, I feel very bad.
    "No arduous task is terrible, no harsh environment is terrible, but the most terrible thing is to neglect political leadership. Politics is the soul, and it must never be neglected."
    The 1205 team is the team I used to be in. From Yumen to Daqing, it has been a benchmark team for seven consecutive years. In 1963, the national economic situation improved, and the well team cadres mistakenly believed that the class struggle situation had also improved, and they should "seize the footage!" They said: "Benchmark, benchmark, we have to steam white steamed buns for people to see, and if the footage doesn't go up, it doesn't look like a benchmark." They were burdened with pride, relaxed politics, and neglected class struggle and ideological work. As a result, some workers heard that pork was valuable, and wanted to go home to raise pigs, saying that raising pigs was better than being a driller; some workers left their posts to go to the movies. The famous "little tiger" on the team became a "little mouse," and accidents happened one after another. A fire broke out and a well was abandoned, causing great losses, and the "benchmark" was lost in the first half of the year. At this time, the cadres woke up, sat down and conducted a month and a half of rectification training to summarize the lessons learned. The cadres checked and said: "At that time, the cadres only wanted to 'carry the red flag' and drill more wells. They only cared about carrying the small red flag and running forward, and they didn't know that so many problems had occurred, which was really dangerous!"
    The workers' problems are the cadres' problems, the problems below are the leaders' problems, and all problems are ideological problems. The problem of the 1205 team is the problem of my brigade leader. I neglected politics and relaxed leadership ideologically. I thought that advanced teams like the 1205 team were all teams that grabbed mountain tops in the difficult times of 1960, 1961, and 1962, and they could not be dragged down or broken down. Now that things have improved, what problems can there be! Therefore, I didn't grasp as tightly as before, and I went less often. With such neglect, I took a big detour. I went to the team to review for three days. Under the care of the work committee and under the leadership of the drilling Party committee, the well team staff further improved their understanding through this rectification training, firmly grasped prominence politics, firmly grasped political command, and further established a revolutionary outlook on life that was not for money, not for fame, not afraid of hardship, and not afraid of death. The "little mouse" became a "little tiger" again. They found lessons in the first half of the year, and in the second half of the year, politics took the lead. As a result, one well was drilled, one well was completed, and every well was qualified. The ground continued to come up. In 1964 and 1965, they were again rated as five-good benchmark teams. Through this lesson, I further realized that it is not terrible for class struggle to be reflected strongly among the workers and staff, no arduous task is terrible, no harsh environment is terrible, but the most terrible thing is to neglect political leadership. Politics is the soul, and it must never be neglected.
    "Class struggle cannot be let go at all. We must fight for a lifetime and fight to the end."
    Class struggle cannot be let go at all. We must fight for a lifetime, fight to the end, and fight until we stop breathing. Some people have also advised me and said: "Don't take care of things when you see them, and don't say things when you see them. If you are tough, there will be a lot of right and wrong! Just be sloppy, open one eye and close one eye!" I asked him: "Where did you learn this fallacy from? Why is there a lot of right and wrong if you are tough?" He said: "If you are tough, people will not like you everywhere. What will happen if you say things when you see them?" I said: "What did the Party call me here to do? Why don't I say it? According to the Party's instructions, I have to say everything that should be said, and I have to do everything that should be done! I will fight for a lifetime and fight to the end. For the sake of the Party and for the sake of the revolution, what am I afraid of."
    Chairman Mao taught us that work is struggle. We are working and fighting to solve difficulties. Through six years of battle in Daqing, I deeply realized that a revolutionary's life is a life of fighting, a life of overcoming difficulties. We must struggle hard for a lifetime and fight for a lifetime. Struggle is to fight against the heavens, fight against the earth, fight against class enemies, and fight against people's wrong ideas. We must fight forever. We can't finish fighting, so we call the next generation to fight again until we fight out communism.
    "It's all the Party's teachings and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought"
    The reason why I can do some work for the Party and the people is all due to the Party's teachings and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. In the old society, I pulled a stick and led my blind father to beg for food when I was six years old. In 1938, when the Yumen Oil Mine was established, I was dragged to be a coolie and worked for more than ten years, suffering and selling my life. I didn't get a set of bedding. I spread out a pile of wheat straw and covered it with a tattered sheepskin. I had never been on a drilling rig or touched a brake handle. After liberation, after democratic reform, anti-feudal head, I complained and improved my class awareness. It was the Party who saved me, turned me over, and made me the master of the country, and also trained me to be a deputy driller. At that time, I only wanted to learn technology well and work hard for the Party to repay the Party's kindness.
    Later, I joined the Party. Under the Party's continuous education, my class awareness has also been constantly improved. I learned that there are still many people in the world like my mother, who were beaten and beaten again by the Baojia chiefs in the old society; there are also many people like my father, who were beaten and scolded by landlords and sentenced to several years in prison; there are also many people like me who begged for food, were unemployed, exploited, and oppressed. Communists are internationalists. I am a communist. Now drilling wells is for the prosperity of the motherland, and also to support those who are seeking liberation and making revolution in the world. I realized that the previous simple idea of repaying kindness was low-level. I understood that drilling wells is revolution, drilling wells is fighting against the reactionaries, and drilling wells is for the liberation of the oppressed people all over the world.
    Under the cultivation of the Party, I have become a cadre from an ordinary worker, from a well captain, a brigade captain, to the current deputy commander. A communist cannot say that the level is low and do not do it! This is the Party's trust. I always think that I am a driller. Even if I become a cadre, I am still a driller, and I must always participate in labor. Chairman Mao taught us to be "willing oxen." I raised cattle when I was a child, and I know the temperament of cattle the most. Cattle eat grass, horses eat feed, cattle enjoy the least and contribute the most. Therefore, it is best to be a "old scalper." I am willing to work hard for the Party and the people on the oil front for a lifetime and be a "old scalper" for a

    读毛主席的书　听毛主席的话
    为无产阶级革命事业奋斗一辈子
    大庆“铁人”王进喜同志的报告（摘要）
    编者按：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，为无产阶级革命事业奋斗一辈子。”王进喜同志的这些话，充分显示了大庆人的精神面貌，显示了中国工人阶级的高度觉悟。在毛泽东思想哺育下，王进喜同志有坚定的政治方向，彻底的革命精神，大无畏的战斗风格，艰苦朴素的工作作风。王进喜同志从一个普通工人成长为工人阶级的“铁人”，最有力地说明了：毛泽东思想武装起来的人，多么坚强，多么有力量。
    工人阶级的先进分子是彻底的革命派。王进喜在大庆工作的历史，就是在党的领导下彻底革命的历史。在建设大庆油田的过程中，王进喜同广大战友一起，同天斗，同地斗，同阶级敌人斗，同错误思想斗，取得胜利不骄傲，遇到挫折不灰心，再接再厉，一往无前，表现了彻底革命者的本色。
    “阶级斗争在职工中反映再强烈不可怕，任何艰巨任务不可怕，任何艰苦环境也不可怕，忽视政治领导最可怕。”王进喜所以能成为一个彻底的革命者，就是因为他深切地体会到这一点，时时事事不忘阶级和阶级斗争，时时事事突出政治。
    彻底的革命者，总是以天下为己任，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，坚持革命，勇往直前。王进喜同志说的对：“打几个漂亮仗是不难的，要是做一辈子艰苦的事情，就要不断学习毛主席著作，不断改造自己才能办到。”
    读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，在三大革命运动的实践中，我们国家涌现了千千万万的英雄人物。雷锋、王杰、麦贤得、焦裕禄就是军事战线、农业战线这类英雄人物的出色代表；王进喜就是工业交通战线这类英雄人物的出色代表。我们向英雄人物学习，首先就要学习他们活学活用毛泽东思想，彻底革命的精神。
    全国工业交通工作会议和工业交通政治工作会议开扩大会议特请大庆“铁人”王进喜同志作报告
    新华社十六日讯　全国工业交通工作会议和全国工业交通政治工作会议今天在人民大会堂举行扩大会议，特请全国闻名的劳动模范、全国工业交通先进人物的代表、大庆“铁人”王进喜同志作了报告，报告题目是“读毛主席的书听毛主席的话为无产阶级革命事业奋斗一辈子”。
    会议由陶鲁笳同志主持。
    听王进喜同志报告的，有参加全国工业交通工作会议、全国工业交通政治工作会议和省市自治区工会主席会议的全体同志，中央工业交通各部的部长、政治部主任，还有北京市机关、团体、工矿企业的职工共计一万三千多人。
    王进喜同志报告以后，薄一波、余秋里、陶鲁笳等负责同志接见了他，并且进行了谈话。
    大庆油田的胜利，是毛主席思想的胜利，是党的总路线的胜利，是大学解放军的结果，是全国各兄弟单位支援的结果。我在会战中为党做了一点工作，这完全是党的培养，毛主席的教导，群众的帮助。要是没有党，没有群众，我个人算个啥。
    我在解放前，连玉门都没有出去过。解放初期，思想觉悟很低，眼光很浅，“井底的蛤蟆只看见碗大的一块天”，只知有碗饭吃，要为党好好工作。经过党的培养教育，我参加了中国共产党，在党和毛主席的教育下，阶级觉悟逐渐提高，为党做了一些工作，党却给了很大荣誉。我曾出席过甘肃省劳模会和全国群英会，并到全国各地参观学习，眼界扩大了，脑袋瓜也开阔了不少，知道了国内外许多大事情。
    “我们要靠毛主席思想赶快拿下这个新油田”
    一九六○年三月从玉门到大庆，我是带着一股子气去的。刚解放时，我觉得玉门油矿很大，出油很多，以后听说外国人说我们国家是“贫油国”，我很生气。我就不相信，石油光埋在他们的地底下，我们国家这么大的地方，就没有油？外国人还说我们“笨”，我就不相信，天底下只有你外国人聪明？站起来的中国工人阶级，在党和毛主席的领导下，是最聪明的。毛主席教导我们要发奋图强、自力更生。我想光生气不行，还得干，我们一定要找到更多的大油田，多打井，快打井，打好井，多出油，同帝国主义较量较量。
    一九五九年底，我到北京开会，看到大街上跑的汽车，有的背着个包，我就问别人：“这上边装那个家伙干什么？”人家说那是因为没有汽油，烧的煤气。我一听心里真难受，真急人呀！我们这么个大国，汽车没有汽油烧还得了！我是一个石油工人，眼看没有油，让国家作这么大的难，还有脸问！再没问！一到休息时候，我就悄悄地躲在一边，心里很别扭。又憋了一股气。我是个石油工人，难道就眼看着让帝国主义看我们的笑话？就在这个会议期间，听说我国发现个大油田，我高兴得都跳了起来，当时就找部里领导，申请到这个新油田工作。那时恨不得一下子飞到大庆，把大油田拿下来，给帝国主义看看，把石油落后帽子甩到太平洋里去。毛主席讲：“占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。”站起来的中国人民是天不怕、地不怕、不怕鬼、不信邪的硬汉子，非要拿下个大大的油田，为党、为中国人民争这口气不可。
    开完会回到玉门后又听说修正主义和帝国主义，勾勾搭搭，想用石油卡我们的脖子，想叫我们交出红旗，我们能够这么办吗？绝对不能！我们要靠毛主席思想赶快拿下这个新油田，给党争光，给人民争气。
    我们队三十三个人立即坐火车动身去大庆。在火车上我就和大家一起学《为人民服务》和《愚公移山》，学完就讨论为什么参加会战？有的同志说：“去打井搞油！”我说：“这话也对，也不完全对。”我说我们是去革命！帝国主义和修正主义在石油上卡我们，国家没有石油多困难啊！我们一定拿下这个大油田，甩掉石油落后帽子，为全国人民争口气。
    “对党负责，对国家负责，对子孙万代负责，对全世界劳动人民负责”
    我深深体会到：我是打井的人，打井没有压力，就是豆腐地层也钻不进去，泥浆泵没有压力，地下岩屑就带不上来，井没有压力，就喷不出油来，人要没有压力就轻飘飘地过去了，就干不出好工作来。有了压力，干出来的工作，就是高水平、高标准的，经得起子孙万代的检查。
    这压力，不是那个领导给的压力，是我们中国工人阶级自觉自愿的压力。一个革命者，要有责任心，对党负责，对国家负责，对子孙万代负责，对全世界劳动人民负责，就应该有压力。没有油，国家有压力，我们要自觉地分担这个压力。一般的压力还不够，要承担一百吨的压力，一千吨的压力。
    到了大庆，那股子高兴劲，使我这个从来没流过眼泪的人，都高兴得流了眼泪。我激动地说：“这儿就是大油海，这儿就是大油田，摆开战场、甩开钻机干吧！这一下子，可要把石油落后帽子，扔到太平洋里去了！”
    “怕不怕艰苦奋斗，是革命不革命的问题”
    我们当天就奔向目的地。没有房子，就找个破马棚，三堵破墙四面透风，里边满是马粪，我们打扫了一下，三十三个人挤在一起背靠背地过了一夜。有几个人挤的受不住，就抱了一抱草，半夜里摸黑，找了个夹道去睡。第二天醒来一看，还是睡在一口水井边上，地下铺的是冰。这时，有个别的同志就没精神，唉声叹气，说：“这个地方能打井吗？冰天雪地的，没个锅碗盆勺，连个住的地方都没有。”我想这个工人也是个好工人，来的时候，他几次举拳头，表示要到最艰苦的地方去，现在他动摇了。又一想，这里的确是艰苦，不是一般的艰苦，这个新社会长大的青年人，根本没想到有这么艰苦。但是，不管多艰苦，拿油要紧。于是我就问指导员：你当了几年解放军，打仗时遇到这么多困难怎么办？是上还是退？“我没有打过仗，我想怎么也不能退。”指导员孙永臣说：“绝对不能退！剩下一个人也要上！要顶着打，直到胜利为止。”好，我们两个人的想法一样。我们就带着这个问题学毛主席著作。毛主席说：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”搞油是在野外打井，不能把井架安在楼房里，安在城市里，过去是这样，现在是这样，今后还是这样，这是工作性质所确定的。现在我们少数人的吃苦，能换来多数人的幸福，换来子孙万代的幸福。这就是我们石油工人最大的幸福。
    我认为怕不怕艰苦奋斗，是革命不革命的问题，如果不艰苦奋斗，就要贪图享受，就要变质。打几个漂亮仗是不难的，要是做一辈子艰苦的事情，就要不断学习毛主席著作，不断改造自己才能办到。
    钻机没到，我们派人去车站打听钻机什么时候到，有的人平井场，作准备，我所关心的是这个地方地层好打不好打，钻井速度快不快。毛主席教导我们，“没有调查就没有发言权”，所以我就到处了解地层情况和钻井速度，并且组织全队学习《实践论》和《矛盾论》。越学心里越明亮，大家说：拿下大油田，一定会碰到许许多多的困难，还会有这样那样的矛盾。但是，石油满足不了国家的需要，才是最大的矛盾。这个矛盾不解决，帝国主义、现代修正主义，就会利用这个缺口，卡我们，封锁我们。上，有困难；不上，就更困难。出路只有一条，就是坚决战胜困难，高速度、高水平地拿下大油田。大家都把井场当成跟帝国主义、修正主义较量的战场。每个人的岗位，就是为党、为国家、为人民争光的岗位。为了多打井，多出油，刀山也要上，火海也要下，只要为了党的事业，个人的生命算什么？　
    没多久，钻机运到车站。那时，“快摆硬上”来了那么多井队，吊车、拖拉机不够用。怎么办？是等，还是上？我想起毛主席的教导：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”是的，革命，就有困难，有困难就有斗争，这不是看戏，不是下馆子，打井就是革命，国家缺油，就要拿出油来，搞油就有困难，你不去斗争，要我们共产党员干什么？我们马上开了支委会，组织大家学《愚公移山》，发动大家讨论怎么办？同志们说：干革命不能等，有条件上，没有条件创造条件也要上，人拉肩扛也要把钻机弄到井场。大家一个个象小老虎，硬是用绳子拉，橇杠撬，木块垫，一寸一寸，一尺一尺地把六十多吨的钻机拉到井场，安装好。
    开钻打井得有水，当时，水管线没安好，水罐车又没有，怎么办？好多人说：没有水，咱们就是用脸盆端也得开钻。这时候，有个人说：“你们见过哪个国家是端水打井的？”我说：“就是我们国家！我们就是尿尿也要打井！”就这样，用大桶、小桶、脸盆硬是端了一百多吨水，才开了钻。
    “困难是欺软怕硬，你的思想是硬的，它就要变成豆腐，你要软，他就硬”
    开钻不久，又遇到漏层。大伙说：漏多少，端多少。把村子里水井的水端干了，我们就跑到一里多地的水泡子，砸冰取水，终于战胜了漏层，用六天多的时间，打成了第一口井。当我们看到哗哗喷出的石油，大家都高兴得跳起来。通过实践，我深深体会到：和自然作斗争就不能怕困难，困难是欺软怕硬，你的思想是硬的，它就要变成豆腐，你要软，它就硬。
    打完第一口井要放井架搬家，没有拖拉机，我们全体职工硬是想办法，用人拉放井架。在指挥放井架时，一根钻杆滚下来把我的腿砸坏了，我昏过去了，醒来一看，工人抱着我的腿哭，井架还没放下来。我急了，就说：“打仗时伤了人，你哭，敌人来了把你们都活捉去，能哭吗？”我就坐起来继续指挥放，工人就把衬衣撕下来给我包住。井架放下来，大家叫我住院，我不去。这天是“五一”，战区召开万人大会，我说：“这是第一次万人大会，不去怎么了解大会精神，又怎么能多打井，快打井，打好井。是腿要紧，还是出油要紧？”并和大家说好，谁也不准给领导讲，大家给找了个马车，把我送去了。
    万人大会上，工委领导表扬了我们，给我披红戴花，让骑大马，叫我讲话，还号召全体职工向我学习。向我学啥啊，我们才打了一口井，还是工委领导亲自领着我们全体职工干的，没有党的领导，没有全体职工，我能干个啥，心里感到不安。万人大会上工委提出：尽快拿下大油田，“六一”把原油运出去，坚决要打个大胜仗。我听了这个号召后，忘了腿痛，当晚赶回队去，就和大家讨论怎么办？大伙说：下一口井是战区第一口生产井，要力争把我们打的第一口井的原油运出去，支援全国建设。干工作光有一股子干劲，猛冲猛打是不行的，三国有个张飞，他还粗中有细嘛！我们立即总结打第一口井的经验，给打第二口井提办法。
    坏腿的事，以后领导还是知道了，对我非常关怀，硬是把我送到医院。在医院里怎么能躺得住呀！万人大会上工委的号召，全国人民都在眼巴巴地看着我们，我还在住医院，这怎么行？我就偷着溜回来，参加打第二口井。我拄着棍，在井上指挥，不久终于打成了战区第一口生产井，保证了“六一”原油外运，支援全国建设。
    一九六一年二月成立大队，我当了大队长。不久，领导指示我们转移到南线去打井，这时矛盾出来了。有个队的干部找我说：“我给你提个意见，你一来就在南线打井，还不知道南线压力高，容易井喷，倒霉的井都在南线，我们可不能去啊！”我说：“你说的，我们国家就是要打喷的井，把原油喷的哗哗的，多好啊！为什么怕它喷呢？”经过我们调查，这不是一个人的问题，是代表一部分人的思想。党总支召开会议经过讨论分析认为，有的队对南线地层不太了解，没在南线打过井，怕井喷，怕井斜，是认识不清楚，一定要先解决思想认识问题，决定开展大讨论：国家打井干什么？要打什么样的井？要不要打有压力的井？谁去打？经过大讨论，使职工提高了认识，鼓起了敢于斗争、敢于胜利的信心。工人们说：“怕什么啊！我们党和毛主席领导中国革命，小米加步枪，打出了个新中国，南线高压层有什么可怕的呢！”这一年打成了九十多口井。
    “按毛主席的实践论去干”，“根据我们的条件，走我们自己的道路”
    一九六二年以前规定井斜不超过五度，一九六三年工委又提出高标准，不超过三度。工委领导同志问我：“拥护不拥护？”我说：“坚决拥护，依靠党、依靠全体职工，按毛主席的实践论去干。”回来我们就组织全体职工学《实践论》，有一个技术员一听说要打直井，就搬出那么厚的一本“洋”书看，我奇怪地问他：“你老搬那家伙干啥呢？”他说：“这上头有个自动防斜的工具。”我说：“那很好，这东西现在我们能不能做？”他摇头说：“做不成，做不成！”我生气地说：“你这话等于没说嘛！我们不能搬洋框框，毛主席说要我们自力更生嘛！我们根据我们的条件，走我们自己的道路。你老搬那家伙有啥用呢？”根据毛主席实践再实践的教导，我们坚决走自己的道路。工委领导亲自组织我们钻井的全体职工讨论。同时组织一部分技术干部和老工人三结合，一边摸索着干，一边总结经验。我们边实践边找办法。最后，打成了只有两度多的直井，以后又打出只有半度的直井。
    这次打直井对我教育很深。这是在工委的直接领导下，时时突出政治，事事讲人的因素第一，全体职工知道了打直井的意义，掌握了地层和设备的规律，所以打得又好又快。我过去打了不少的井，有的井打得好，也打过斜井，为什么？主要是没突出政治，没抓人的思想，首先是我的思想歪了，所以，才打出了斜井。要打直井，首先我们脑瓜子里要有个直井，要有高度的政治责任心；脑子里没有个直井，一辈子也打不出直井来。
    一九六五年，工委又提出高标准，要打“三一”优质井（一天、一个钻头、打一千米）。有的井队想打又不敢打，有些人怕丢掉标杆队。我说：我打，我就不怕摸老虎屁股。干革命就不能怕担风险，还没干就吓回来了，那还行。走路，要学小孩走路，小孩腿软，跑起来摔了一跤，爬起来又跑，今天软，明天就不软了；不能学八十岁老头走路，老头走路，摔一跤，再摔一跤，就呜乎哀哉了。这时，另外一个队也打“三一”优质井。两个队并排打，我一面打，一面把发现的问题告诉他们。结果，那个队打成功了，我把井打斜了八度。我在会上向大家检查说，井打斜了是我的责任，不算大家的事，你们的责任，就是帮助找原因。最后总结出八条经验，连续打出六口“三一”优质井。
    通过在大庆几年会战，我深深体会到，毛主席怎么讲，就怎么做，什么困难都能克服。克服困难，首先要有克服困难的信心和决心。不能光看到困难，也要看到成绩，看到有利条件。克服困难，光嘴上说不行，要研究困难，想办法解决困难，去做工作才行。克服一个困难，就是一个胜利，就是一次提高，就学会一个克服困难的办法，就增加一分革命信心。
     “要与天斗、与地斗、与阶级敌人斗，还要与人的错误思想斗”
    干革命不仅要与天斗、与地斗、与阶级敌人斗，还要与人的错误思想斗。一个人想什么，也得有个规格，有些事情是不能想的，有些事情是可以开阔地去想。要想，就要想怎样拿下大油田，想这么多困难怎么克服，想我们给全国每个人多少石油，想社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    有一个青年工人，是我喜爱的徒弟，有一段经不起考验，闹情绪要回玉门。我就把他找来严厉对他说：“你还记得你刚到玉门是个什么样子吗？穿条裤子没有腿，穿件衣服露着肚子，一双鞋补了又补有几斤重，你忘了吗？我可没忘，我也穿过几斤重的鞋。现在你身上穿着毛衣，床上铺着缎子被，这些都是怎么来的？都是党给的，毛主席给的。”说得他直哭，他承认错误说：“我错了，你说咋办哩！”我说：“好好干，我们苦，顶多是多出两身汗，少睡一点觉，你看我们的革命前辈，那么大年纪还跑到草原上来吃苦，为什么？我们应该好好想一想，向老前辈学习。”
    热爱党、热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义，不能站在房子里热爱，不能光举拳头热爱，不能在口头上热爱，要干事。我们是打井的，把井打出来，把油拿出来，才是真正的热爱，不干就等于瞎说。热爱要永远热爱下去，就必须永远老老实实干下去。
    有一次打完进尺，射孔层位老定不下来，耽误十几个小时。射不了孔，就搬不了家。那时井多人少，新地层，一时也难定下来。可是我着急的跑到地质指挥所，问他们是怎么搞的？有个同志说：“你干什么的？”我说：“我干什么的？我就是找你们麻烦的！你们确定不下来，射不了孔，搬不了家，耽误多大事呀！”有人劝我说：“不要着急，顶多耽误一会儿打井。”我一听就觉得不对味，怎么能说这样的话呢！少打一口井，和帝国主义、修正主义斗争就少一分力量。我就跳起来说：“为什么让我耽误一会儿打井，为什么不让我多打两口井？你有什么理由？”越说越生气，我往桌子上一坐说：“晚上我不回去，你们什么时候确定，我爬起来就走。”你看看，我这大老粗，现在想起来，感到多不好。
    “任何艰巨任务不可怕，任何艰苦环境也不可怕，忽视政治领导最可怕。政治是灵魂，绝对忽视不得”
    一二零五队是我原来所在的那个队，从玉门到大庆，是连续七年的标杆队。一九六三年全国经济形势好转，井队干部错误地认为阶级斗争形势也好转了，应该“抓抓进尺啦！”，说：“标杆，标杆，要蒸出白馒头给人看看，进尺上不去，不象个标杆样子。”背上骄傲包袱，就放松了政治，忽视了阶级斗争和思想工作。结果有的工人听说猪肉值钱，就想回家养猪，说养猪比干钻工强；有的工人离开岗位去看电影。队上有名的“小老虎”变成了“小老鼠”，事故接连发生，着了一把火，打废了一口井，造成很大损失，上半年就丢了“标杆”。这时干部才清醒过来，坐下来搞了一个半月的整训，总结教训。干部检查说：“那时，干部一心只想‘扛红旗’多打井，只管自己扛着小红旗朝前跑，出现了那么多问题还不知道，真危险啊！”
    工人的问题是干部的问题，下面的问题是领导的问题，一切问题是思想问题。一二零五队的问题，是我大队长的问题，是我忽视了政治，在思想上放松了领导，认为象一二零五队这些先进队，在六○年、六一年和六二年那么困难的时候，都是抢山头的队伍，拖不垮，打不烂，现在好转了，还会有什么问题！所以，抓得就没有以前那么紧，去的就少了一点。这样一忽视，走了个大弯路。我到队上去检讨了三天。在工委的关怀下，在钻井党委的领导下，井队职工通过这次整训，进一步提高认识，狠抓突出政治；狠抓政治挂帅，进一步树立不为钱、不为名、不怕苦、不怕死的革命人生观。“小老鼠”又变成“小老虎”。上半年找到教训，下半年政治挂了帅，结果是打一口井，成一口井，口口井合格，一直地上来了，一九六四年和一九六五年又评为五好标杆队。通过这次教训，我进一步地认识到，阶级斗争在职工中反映再强烈不可怕，任何艰巨任务不可怕，任何艰苦环境也不可怕，忽视政治领导最可怕。政治是灵魂，绝对忽视不得。
    “阶级斗争一点也不能放过，要斗争一辈子，斗到底”
    阶级斗争一点也不能放过，要斗争一辈子，斗到底，斗争到停止呼吸的时候算。也有的人劝过我说：“你不要见事就管，见事就说，刚强是非多呀！马马虎虎，睁一个眼闭一个眼算了！”我问他：“你从哪里学来的谬论啊？为什么刚强就是非多？”他说：“刚强到处惹人不爱。你见事就说，怎么了得？”我说：“党叫我到这里来干什么？我为什么不说？按党的指示，应该说的我都要说，应该干的我都要干！我要斗争一辈子，斗到底。为了党，为了革命，我有什么可怕的。”
    毛主席教导我们说：工作就是斗争。我们是为着解决困难去工作，去斗争的。在大庆通过六年会战我深深地体会到：一个革命者的一生，就是战斗的一生，就是克服困难的一生，要艰苦奋斗一辈子，要斗争一辈子。斗争就是与天斗，与地斗，与阶级敌人斗，与人的错误思想斗。要永远斗下去，我们斗不完，叫下一代再斗，直到斗出个共产主义来。
    “全是党的教导和毛主席思想的指引”
    我所以能为党、为人民做些工作，这全是党的教导和毛主席思想的指引。在旧社会我六岁拉着棍子领着双目失明的父亲讨饭。一九三八年玉门油矿一成立，我就被拉去当民夫，干了十来年，受苦卖命，没捞到一套铺盖，铺的是一摊麦草，盖的是一张烂羊皮，没上过钻台，没摸过刹把。解放后，经过民主改革，反封建把头，诉了苦，提高了阶级觉悟。是党救了我，翻了身，当了国家主人，还培养我当了副司钻。那时我只想要好好学技术，为党好好工作，报答党的恩情。
    以后，我入了党，在党的不断教育下，阶级觉悟又有不断提高。知道了世界上现在还有好多象我母亲那样，在旧社会被保甲长打了又打的人；还有好多象我父亲那样，受地主打骂反被判了几年徒刑的人；还有好多象我那样讨饭、失业、受剥削、受压迫的人。共产党员是国际主义者。我是一个共产党员，现在打井，是为了祖国富强，也是为了支援世界上那些求解放闹革命的人。认识到以前那种单纯报恩思想是低水平的。懂得打井就是革命，打井就是和反动派打仗，打井就是为了全世界被压迫的人民得解放。
    在党的培养下我由一个普通工人，当了干部，从井队长、大队长、到现在的副指挥。一个共产党员不能说水平低不干啊！这是党的信任。我总想我是个钻工，当了干部还是钻工，要永远参加劳动。毛主席教导我们要当“孺子牛”。我从小放过牛，最摸牛的脾气，牛吃草，马吃料，牛的享受最少，出力最大，所以，还是当一头“老黄牛”最好，我甘愿在石油战线上，为党、为人民艰苦奋斗一辈子，当一辈子“老黄牛”。
    怎么样才算艰苦奋斗？以前认为共产党员只要吃苦在前，享受在后，多干活，少睡觉，就是艰苦奋斗。在会战期间，一些老首长的艰苦奋斗精神，深深教育着我。我想，他们职位那么高，年龄那么大，为国家搞油，来大庆和大家一起吃苦，为什么？学了毛主席著作，我明白了“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”革命先辈艰苦奋斗，英勇牺牲夺取政权，万里长征才走完第一步。而现在在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，他们为了实现共产主义还在继续艰苦奋斗，我也是一个共产党员，不能只是多干活，少睡觉，这是低标准的艰苦奋斗。应当能为革命担更重的担子；能在最复杂的环境里做艰苦工作；能在最困难的时候顶上去；能在最危险的情况下不怕牺牲；能做别人不愿干、不敢干的革命工作。艰苦奋斗是党的性质确定了的。为了实现共产主义，就要艰苦奋斗一辈子。更主要的是教育青年要艰苦奋斗，把党的光荣传统世世代代传下去。
    “成绩要记在党的账上，记在毛主席的账上，记在全国人民的账上，我只能有个小本子记差距”
    一九六四年党中央表扬我们，我就和同志们大学两分法。毛主席教导我们“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”我就想，搞好工作是党指的路，叫我们走的；没走好，出了问题，领导把责任承担去，干出点成绩就大力表扬，这成绩要记在党的账上，记在毛主席的账上，记在全国人民的账上，我只能有个小本子记差距。所以，我就和同志们到三矿四队去学习严细作风，回来针对我们的井场大找差距，找出“脏”“松”“漏”，不安全和不整齐的大量差距，紧接着就找原因，主要是老毛病旧习惯造成的。我们就向老毛病斗争。
    有一次，我到井场检查工作，一眼看到一个工人擦机器用手抓油，然后将满手的油又擦在衣服上。我觉得这是个坏作风，应该反掉，就批评这个工人。这个工人说：“我第一天到井场，看见师傅就是这样做的。”我就把他师傅找来，批评他没有带好徒弟。这个师傅说：“当初我学徒的时候，看见你也是这样做的。”追来追去追到我的头上来了，我就向工人作了检查，我说：“我是十多年前的老毛病，现在已经改掉了，你们千万别跟我学这种坏作风。”以后，我就随时随地注意克服自己的老习惯、老毛病。这样事还多着呢！我只是举个小例子。要想有个好作风，首先是言教身带；先严格要求自己，再要求别人。
    表扬和批评都是推动我们前进的力量。不能受了表扬，把功劳记在自己账上，沾沾自喜，翘起尾巴；也不能受了批评就垂头丧气，甚至有意见。
    我以前工作不讲方法，批评人有些硬，有的同志对我有意见，我还想不通。学了毛主席著作思想提高了。毛主席说：“……脸是应该经常洗的，不洗也就会灰尘满面。”自己一个脑瓜子看不到缺点，大家那么多脑瓜子看得清楚，脸上有黑，别人给你擦掉有什么不好啊。领导和同志们批评得对也好，不对也好，我应该首先检查自己，严格要求自己。工作究竟干好了没有？干对了没有？干得不好，不对，就要接受意见，坚决改正。
    一九六一年我们把射孔射错了。领导在一次会上批评我们。我晚去了一会，刚到门口，有个工人就对我说：“赶紧趴下趴下！”我说：“趴下干什么？”他说：“领导正在批评我们呢！”我说：“你这个同志说的，披红戴花的时候，你让我抢着往头里走，批评了，就叫我悄悄地趴下当狗熊？我不能当这个狗熊！”我就是要到前面去，更好地听听领导的批评。
    “紧紧跟党走，跟着毛主席走，要跟紧、跟准、跟好”
    我深深体会到：毛主席思想是力量的源泉，是一切胜利的根本。毛主席的思想多一分，人的志气就增加一分，生产就前进一步。只要努力学习毛主席著作，按毛主席的指示办事，自己不骄不躁，艰苦奋斗，一切困难都可以克服，一切矛盾都可以解决，工作就可以搞好。
    我生平最难忘的，就是见过我们伟大的领袖毛主席。一九五九年我见过毛主席，一九六四年参加全国人民代表大会时，又看见了毛主席，兴奋得我直流热泪。我这个在旧社会放牛的穷汉，是党和毛主席使我站了起来，当了国家主人；是党和毛主席教育我成长壮大，给了我无穷的力量和智慧；是党和毛主席给我指引了大道，使我有了方向不断前进。我为党只是做了一点应做的事，党却给我很高很高的评价。这荣誉应归于党，归于毛主席。我做的还很不够，表扬是给我提出了最高的要求，今后要更好地为党工作。
    第三个五年计划开始了，党和全国人民向我们石油工人提出了更高的要求。我们要更加突出政治，更加加紧活学活用毛主席著作，加深队伍的革命化。要全面地贯彻总路线，继续艰苦奋斗，继续走自力更生的道路，把油田建设得更好。革命需要多少油，我们就拿出多少油。要紧紧跟党走，跟着毛主席走，要跟紧、跟准、跟好；党指到那里，就打到那里。
    “手扶刹把象刺刀，钻杆就象机枪和大炮，压力一加，钻头就向地球里头跑，钻完进尺，原油呼噜噜地就往地面冒。支援越南人民，淹死美国佬。”
