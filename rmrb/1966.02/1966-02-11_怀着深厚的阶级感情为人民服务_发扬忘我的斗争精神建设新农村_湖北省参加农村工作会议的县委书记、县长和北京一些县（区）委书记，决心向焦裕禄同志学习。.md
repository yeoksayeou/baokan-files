    Serving the People with Profound Class Feelings
    Developing a Spirit of Selfless Struggle to Build a New Socialist Countryside
    County Party Secretaries and County Heads from Hubei Province Attending the Rural Work Conference and Some County (District) Party Secretaries from Beijing Determined to Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    (Our Wuhan Dispatch, February 10) Learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu has become a central topic of the ongoing Hubei Provincial Rural Work Conference. During the meetings, in the dormitories, in the dining hall, and even before the movies started at night, people couldn't help but talk about Comrade Jiao Yulu. Many comrades were emotionally moved and deeply touched by the lofty image of this county party secretary. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee has decided that the more than 400 county party secretaries, county heads, and other comrades attending this conference will spend three days focusing on studying and discussing the exemplary deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    The purpose of this rural work conference held in Hubei Province is to solve the problem of how to give prominence to politics. In the past few days, many comrades have expressed many good opinions at the meeting. However, the key to giving prominence to politics lies first and foremost in the leading cadres themselves giving prominence to politics. This became clearer only after studying the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu. Many comrades feel that Comrade Jiao Yulu is a mirror, and looking at themselves, they feel very ashamed. Some blame themselves for doing too little work for the Party and the people, while others are moved to tears by Comrade Jiao Yulu's profound class feelings and his spirit of hard struggle.
    You Changyuan, Deputy Secretary of the Xianfeng County Party Committee, said: Comrade Jiao Yulu spent more than a year in Lankao County, braving the wind, rain, and snow, climbing over sand dunes, and finally mastered first-hand materials on how to control the three scourges of Lankao. And what about me? Born and raised in Xianfeng, working here for more than ten years, I have no idea where to plant trees or where to control water. How to transform tens of thousands of mu of rain-fed paddy fields into high-yield, stable-yield farmland is a mystery to me. Instead, I have been content with urging plowing and sowing for many years. What is the reason for this? It is that Comrade Jiao Yulu has abundant revolutionary drive and that he armed his mind with Mao Zedong Thought, which guided his thoughts and actions. And what I lack are precisely these things.
    Liu Xiangjiu, Deputy Secretary of the Baokang County Party Committee, said: The most worthwhile thing to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu is that his words and deeds are consistent. We also talk about serving the people and the poor and lower-middle peasants, but when the wind and rain come, he can stand up and appear in front of the poor and lower-middle peasants, asking them about their well-being. When it rains, we run indoors. He has the 360,000 people of Lankao in his heart and goes deep into the field to grasp first-hand materials despite his serious illness. We are much healthier than him, but our work is content with being general, and as a result, we cannot grasp the essentials, and we cannot formulate a plan to transform nature even after more than ten years in one place.
    Zhang Yuqun, Deputy Secretary of the Luotian County Party Committee, also comes from a poor peasant background. He believes that Comrade Jiao Yulu can maintain his class character because he creatively studies and applies Chairman Mao's works and acts according to Mao Zedong Thought in all his actions: he cares about the suffering of the masses, he is kind to others and strict with himself, he combines revolutionary spirit with a scientific attitude… In a word, he himself gives prominence to politics first.
    Yi Dazhen, Deputy Secretary of the Jianli County Party Committee, said it well: In the past, giving prominence to politics mainly meant giving prominence to it to grassroots cadres and the people, as if there were no problems with ourselves. In fact, there are big problems. Class struggle is an objective reality and must be reflected in everyone, including our county party secretaries. If it is not Comrade Jiao Yulu's ideology and work style, it will inevitably be an individualistic ideology and work style. Only by deeply recognizing this can we open up a battlefield in our own minds and promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology.
    Li Zicao, Deputy Secretary of the Anlu County Party Committee, said: I have worked in Anlu for eighteen years, and the county party committee has called for planting trees every year. But how to ensure planting and survival? Because of the lack of investigation and research, many barren mountains are still barren mountains.
    Shao Zixiu, County Head of Yangxin County, said: We built some electric pumping stations, but later we built reservoirs, and the pumping stations were abandoned. The reservoirs were not comprehensively planned. First, we built a small one, and later we found that we should build a big one. As a result, a small reservoir was placed inside a large reservoir, and manpower and material resources were wasted greatly. This is because the work lacks a strict scientific attitude, because we are afraid of hardship, and we cannot conduct in-depth investigation and research like Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    Qi Xiutao, Secretary of the Shishou County Party Committee, is newly appointed and has not been a secretary before. He said: Taking on a new job, I have some fear of difficulty, and I always want to find a role model to learn from. This time I found Comrade Jiao Yulu. I originally lacked confidence, but when I think of him, I have strength. I am afraid of not doing a good job and that my reputation will be tarnished. These are personal distracting thoughts, but when I think of him, personal distracting thoughts can be removed.
    Many county party committee comrades have expressed that they will bring Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, especially his revolutionary spirit, back to the vast number of cadres and masses, transforming it into strength and action.
    (Xinhua News Agency, February 10) The deeds of Chairman Mao's good student, Jiao Yulu, have greatly shaken the Party Secretaries of various counties (districts) in Beijing. They have expressed their determination to learn from Jiao Yulu and achieve the revolutionization of leadership.
    Shen Cheng, First Secretary of the Haidian District Party Committee, said: "I believe that the main reason why Comrade Jiao Yulu was able to have such abundant revolutionary fighting spirit, in-depth practical and mass-line working methods, and a hard-working style is that 'he has all the people in his heart and only himself absent.' This is the starting point for Comrade Jiao Yulu's work and the driving force for his wholehearted devotion to the revolution and the people. In the past, our district party committee also organized leading cadres to study Chairman Mao's works, but we didn't really master them. Our conditions are much better than those of Lankao County, which was led by Comrade Jiao Yulu, but we have not completed the Party's tasks as excellently as he did. The fundamental problem is that the leading cadres of our district party committee have not been revolutionized. Therefore, simply trying to find solutions from methods cannot solve the problem."
    Huo Liang, Secretary of the Fangshan County Party Committee, said: "There are too many things worth learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu. I feel that the most important thing is his single-minded and wholehearted service to the people. When he was critically ill, he was still considering the safety of the people of Lankao County. On the second day of Comrade Jiao Yulu's arrival at the county party committee, he went to the countryside to visit poor and lower-middle peasants, eating, living, and working together with them. When we go to the countryside, we often only talk to some cadres. Comrade Jiao Yulu only worked in Lankao County for a little over a year, and he visited 120 out of 149 production brigades in the county. I have worked in Fangshan County for three years, and there are still two communes that I have never visited, and some mountainous communes have been visited very little. In the past, I thought it was because I was too busy to go down there, but this is actually an excuse. The main reason is that I lack the thorough thought of serving the revolution and the people in my mind, and therefore, I also lack a strong desire to change the face of the mountainous areas."
    Xing Jun, First Secretary of the Chaoyang District Party Committee, said: "Comrade Jiao Yulu's mass viewpoint has enlightened me the most. Our ideological revolutionization is not enough, and our class feelings are also fading day by day. We often fail to feel the strongest resonance for the problems of the masses, especially the problems of concern to the poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, we cannot eliminate all difficulties to conduct in-depth practical investigation and research and rely on the masses to find solutions to problems. In the future, we must go to the masses like Comrade Jiao Yulu, rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants to solve problems, and do a good job in the work of the district party committee."

    怀着深厚的阶级感情为人民服务
    发扬忘我的斗争精神建设新农村
    湖北省参加农村工作会议的县委书记、县长和北京一些县（区）委书记，决心向焦裕禄同志学习。
    本报武汉十日电　向焦裕禄同志学习，已经成为正在召开的湖北省农村工作会议的一个中心议题。在开会时，在宿舍、饭厅里，甚至在晚上电影放映之前，人们都情不自禁地谈论着焦裕禄同志；许多同志内心激动，深深地被这位县委书记的高大形象所感动。中共湖北省委作出决定：参加这次会议的四百多名县委书记、县长和其他同志，集中三天时间学习和讨论焦裕禄同志的模范事迹。
    湖北省召开的这次农村工作会议，目的在于解决如何突出政治的问题。几天来，许多同志在会上发表了不少很好的意见。但是，突出政治的关键，首先在于领导干部自己突出政治这一点，还是在学习焦裕禄同志的事迹之后才更加明确的。许多同志认为，焦裕禄同志是一面镜子，对照自己，内心十分抱愧。有人责备自己为党为人民做的工作太少，有人为焦裕禄同志深厚的阶级感情、艰苦奋斗的思想作风感动得流出了热泪。
    咸丰县委副书记游长远说：焦裕禄同志到兰考县一年多的时间里，顶风向，冒雨雪，翻沙丘，终于掌握了制服兰考三害的第一手材料。而我呢？生在咸丰，长在咸丰，参加工作也十多年了，可是那里该造林，那里该治水，十几万亩望天收的水田怎样改造成高产稳产的农田，胸中无数，而是长年以来满足于催耕催种的现状。原因究竟在那里？在于焦裕禄同志有充沛的革命干劲，在于他用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑，指导了他的思想和行动，而我所缺乏的正是这些东西。
    保康县委副书记刘香久说：焦裕禄同志最值得学的一点是他言行一致。我们在口头上也讲为人民、为贫下中农服务，可是在风雨来临时，他能挺身而出，出现在贫下中农面前，问寒问暖；我们在下雨时，却是往屋子里跑。他胸怀兰考三十六万人民，带着重病深入现场抓第一手材料，而我们身体比他好得多，工作却满足于一般化，结果是抓不住要领，在一个地方十几年也订不出一个改造自然的规划来。
    罗田县委副书记张玉群也是贫农出身，他认为焦裕禄同志能保持阶级的本色，根本原因是他活学活用毛主席著作，一切行动按毛主席思想办事：他关心群众疾苦，他待人宽对己严，他把革命精神同科学态度结合起来……。一句话是他自己首先突出政治。
    监利县委副书记易大振说得好：过去，突出政治主要是向基层干部、人民群众去突出，而自己好象并不存在什么问题了。其实大有问题。阶级斗争是客观存在，必然要反映到每个人身上，也包括我们县委书记，不是焦裕禄同志的思想作风，就必然是个人主义的思想作风，只有深刻地认识这一点，才能在自己头脑里开辟一个战场，才能兴无灭资。
    安陆县委副书记李子漕说：我在安陆工作十八年，县委年年号召植树，但怎样做到保栽保活，因为没有调查研究，结果，许多荒山仍然是荒山。
    阳新县县长邵自修说：我们建了一些电力抽水机站，后来修了水库，抽水站就废了；水库没有全面规划，先修个小的，后来又发现应该修大的，结果大水库里装着个小水库，人力物力浪费很大。这就是因为工作缺乏严格的科学态度，因为怕苦，不能象焦裕禄同志那样深入调查研究。
    石首县委书记齐修韬，是新到任的，过去没有当过书记。他说：担任新的工作，很有些畏难情绪，总想找个学习的榜样。这次算是找到了焦裕禄同志。我原来缺乏信心，一想到他，就有了力量；我怕搞不好工作，自己名声不好听，这是个人杂念，一想到他，个人杂念就可以去掉了。
    许多县委同志表示，他们要把焦裕禄同志的事迹，特别是他的革命精神带回去，带到广大干部和群众中去，转为力量，化为行动。
    据新华社十日讯　毛主席的好学生——焦裕禄的事迹，给北京市各县（区）委书记极大的震动，他们纷纷表示，要决心学习焦裕禄，实现领导革命化。
    中共海淀区委第一书记沈澄说：“我认为焦裕禄同志所以能有那样充沛的革命斗志、深入实际深入群众的工作方法和艰苦奋斗的作风，最主要的是‘他心里装着全体人民，唯独没有自己’。这是焦裕禄同志进行一切工作的出发点，也是他一心为革命，一心为人民的动力。过去我们区委也组织领导干部学过毛主席著作，却没有真正学到手。我们的条件比焦裕禄同志所领导的兰考县好多了，但是没有象他那样出色完成党的任务。根本问题是我们区委领导干部没有革命化。因此，光从方法上想办法是解决不了问题的。”
    中共房山县委书记霍梁说：“焦裕禄同志值得我学的东西太多了，我感觉最重要的是他一心一意，全心全意为人民服务的思想，他病危的时候还在考虑兰考全县人民的安危。焦裕禄同志刚到县委的第二天，就下乡访问贫农下中农，和他们吃住在一起，打成一片。而我们下乡去，往往只找一些干部谈谈。焦裕禄同志在兰考县实际工作只有一年多，全县一百四十九个大队，他去过一百二十个。我在房山县工作三年了，至今还有两个公社没有去过，有些山区公社去得很少。过去还认为是自己工作忙，下不去，实际上这是借口，主要是自己脑子里缺乏彻底为革命为人民的思想，因此也缺乏改变山区面貌的强烈愿望。”
    中共朝阳区委第一书记邢军说：“焦裕禄同志的群众观点对我的启发最大了，我们的思想革命化不够，阶级感情也一天天的淡薄了，对群众中的问题，特别是贫农下中农所关心的问题往往引不起我们最强烈的共鸣。因此，也不能做到排除一切困难去深入实际调查研究，依靠群众找出解决问题的办法。今后，我们一定要象焦裕禄同志那样到群众中去，依靠贫农下中农解决问题，做好区委工作。”
