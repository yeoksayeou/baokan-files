    Xinhua News Agency, February 8th. Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of commune members and cadres in China's cotton-producing areas have continuously achieved substantial increases in cotton production. The State Council recently convened the Fifth National Cotton Production Conference, comprehensively summarizing the experiences of substantial increases in cotton production, and called on the vast numbers of cadres and commune members in cotton-growing areas to continue to exert revolutionary energy, further carry out the movement to learn from, compare with, catch up with, and help each other, and strive for a dual harvest of grain and cotton in 1966.
    Party and state leaders such as Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping received the representatives attending the conference. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Tan Zhenlin made important reports at the meeting. Premier Zhou Enlai also listened to reports from representatives of regions and units with remarkable cotton production achievements, including leading cadres from agriculture and supply and marketing departments, cotton-growing experts, and scientific and technical personnel, and held discussions with them on some major key issues in current cotton production. The representatives were greatly encouraged and unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely respond to the Party's call, make persistent efforts, and strive to comprehensively and overfulfill the cotton production tasks for the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan.

          New Situation in Cotton Production Development
    The representatives attending this conference came from 358 counties in 19 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, totaling more than 700 people, an increase of 91 counties' representatives compared to the previous conference. The broad participation of representatives in this conference demonstrates the new situation in the development of cotton production in our country.
    The large amount of materials provided at the meeting showed that last year, the national cotton production achieved the goals set by the Fourth National Cotton Production Conference, thereby bringing China's cotton production to a new level, with both total output and yield per unit area being the highest in history. Whether in the southern or northern cotton-growing areas, old or new cotton-growing areas, concentrated or dispersed cotton-growing areas, there were universal increases in production, and provinces, municipalities, and prefectures with an average yield of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu emerged, with the number of counties producing 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu doubling compared to the previous year. There also appeared some communes and production teams with an average yield of 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
    The meeting reflected some distinct characteristics of China's cotton production increase last year, the main one being that in the northern cotton-growing areas, which have a large area and previously had relatively low yields, the cotton yield per unit area began to increase significantly. Provinces, regions, and cities such as Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Xinjiang, and Beijing all achieved substantial or relatively large increases in production. Shanxi Province, despite suffering from severe drought, still increased the average yield of cotton fields by more than 10% throughout the province. Secondly, in the Yangtze River basin, where cotton yields were already relatively high, production continued to rise. Zhejiang Province and the suburbs of Shanghai, whose average yield broke the 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu mark in 1964, achieved new improvements in cotton yield last year. Hubei and Jiangsu provinces, which have the largest cotton-growing areas in the southern cotton-growing areas, also achieved significant achievements. Although Jiangsu Province suffered from relatively severe natural disasters such as typhoons and continuous rain during the critical period of cotton growth, most areas such as Nantong and Suzhou still increased production, with the exception of a few areas that experienced decreased production. Provinces such as Jiangxi, Anhui, and Sichuan also had significant increases in production. The third characteristic is that the red banner of dual grain and cotton harvests has been raised higher, and the number of counties with high yields of both grain and cotton has increased. These include southern counties such as Changshu, Qidong, Taicang, Shazhou, and Jingjiang in Jiangsu, Xinzhou, Huanggang, and Xishui in Hubei, Nanhui, Fengxian, Jiading, and Chongming in Shanghai, and Pinghu, Yuyao, Haiyan, Shangyu, and Zhenhai in Zhejiang, as well as northern counties such as Gaocheng, Leting, and Wuji in Hebei, Wugong in Shaanxi, and Pinggu and Tongxian in Beijing. The average yields of cotton and grain in these counties have reached or exceeded the targets set by the "National Agricultural Development Program." In addition, some concentrated cotton-producing counties that were originally unable to be self-sufficient in grain have changed the past situation of "the state supplying grain, and farmers growing cotton." While continuing to achieve high cotton yields, they have achieved grain self-sufficiency or self-sufficiency with a surplus. Among these counties, Tianmen in Hubei has achieved outstanding results. Last year, this county produced 920,000 dan of ginned cotton, while also handing over 15 million jin of grain and selling more than 110,000 dan of edible oil. The fourth characteristic is that the number of high-yield models is increasing. Last year, high-yield units with large areas and advanced production teams creating high-yield records appeared in all directions, east, west, south, and north, in the cotton-growing areas across the country. From Shanghai in the east to Xinjiang in the west, from Liaoning in the north to Yunnan in the south, there were high-yield units with yields of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. It is particularly gratifying that Chaoyang Prefecture in Liaoning Province, the northernmost cotton-growing area in China with a short frost-free period, has seen counties with an average yield of nearly 100 jin per mu and production teams with a yield exceeding 200 jin per mu. The Baitazi Brigade of Linglongta Commune in Jianchang County of this prefecture planted 375 mu of cotton last year, with an average yield of 190 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The fourth and sixth production teams of this brigade achieved a yield of over 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The fifth characteristic is that the cotton-growing area has seen new development. Provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian, which originally did not grow cotton or grew very little cotton, and some grain-producing areas in Hunan Province, have begun to expand the scope of trial planting and cotton-growing area in a planned way on the basis of successful trial planting in previous years, and some high-yield models have emerged. This shows that the area suitable for cotton planting in China is vast, and the cotton-growing area can continue to expand.
    The meeting pointed out that these characteristics of cotton production increase last year not only vividly reflect the current excellent situation of cotton production in our country, but also show that the potential for developing cotton production in our country is huge and there is much that can be done. The meeting commended a group of units with particularly outstanding cotton production achievements and called on all localities to conscientiously learn from and promote their advanced experiences, take them as examples, vigorously carry out the mass movement of learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and helping each other, and promote China's cotton production to a new level.

        What are the reasons for the substantial increase in cotton production?
    The meeting carefully analyzed the reasons for the substantial increase in cotton production last year and unanimously believed that the continuous and substantial increase in cotton production in our country is the result of the vast number of commune members and cadres in cotton-growing areas studying Chairman Mao's works diligently, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing politics, and deeply carrying out the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. Last year, the cadres and commune members in various cotton-growing areas, in studying Chairman Mao's works diligently, combined their own ideological realities and production realities, used the viewpoint of "one divides into two," conscientiously summarized the experience of cotton production increase in the previous years, and, in the spirit of finding shortcomings after winning victories, looked for gaps, checked for loopholes, tapped potential, and eliminated the complacency of some people who thought that "production increase has reached the top" due to continuous bumper harvests of cotton, and established lofty ambitions, and extensively carried out the mass movement of learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and helping each other with the revolutionary spirit of bearing in mind the motherland and having the world in view, and strived for higher and higher cotton yields, and turning low yields into high yields. The cotton-growing areas universally promoted the experience of leading cadres, scientific and technical personnel, and farmers combining to establish demonstration plots, using demonstration plots to drive general cotton fields, and promoting various advanced cotton planting experiences according to local conditions. Many cotton-growing areas in the south also used the method of "inviting in and sending out," hiring cotton-growing experts from high-yield cotton areas to serve as technicians to guide local farmers to grow cotton, or sending people to high-yield units to learn cotton-planting experience. In some areas, leading cadres also took cotton-growing experts as teachers, followed them to the fields, and took the lead in learning and promoting advanced experiences. In areas where this was done, cotton production increased significantly. Because leading cadres took the lead, deeply mobilized the masses, and adopted practical and feasible methods, the advanced experiences of high-yield cotton areas and high-yield units were popularized and improved, thereby promoting the formation of a mass movement of learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and helping each other in the vast cotton-growing areas. At the same time, all walks of life, especially commercial supply and marketing departments, industrial transportation, and scientific, cultural, educational, and health departments, faced the countryside and strongly supported cotton production. While summarizing the experience of ideological revolution driving substantial cotton production increase, the meeting also systematically summarized the complete set of technical experiences created by our country's scientific workers and farmers in cotton production.

      New tasks for cotton production this year
    On the basis of summarizing and exchanging last year's experience of substantial cotton production increase, the meeting put forward new tasks for national cotton production this year. The meeting demanded that commune members and cadres in all cotton-producing areas continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further emphasize politics, promote the Dazhai spirit, grow cotton for the revolution, grow cotton with revolutionary spirit, advance victoriously, strive for higher yields in high-yield areas, and strive for substantial increases in production in low-yield areas on the basis of last year's production increase. The meeting emphasized that it is necessary to correctly implement the Party and state's guiding principles and policies on developing cotton production, to have sufficient enthusiasm, to take steady steps, and especially to pay attention to correctly handling the relationship between grain and cotton. Cotton-producing areas should further implement the policy of "taking grain as the key link, combining grain and cotton," using grain to ensure cotton and using cotton to promote grain, and strive for a dual harvest of grain and cotton. All localities should also, while grasping cotton production in concentrated cotton-producing areas, develop cotton production in dispersed cotton areas and new cotton areas in a manner that is suitable to local conditions, planned, and step-by-step. In areas that did not produce cotton in the past, or produced very little cotton, it is advocated that production teams should try to plant a small amount of cotton in places where conditions permit. The meeting demanded that all localities must ensure the implementation of the cotton-planting area stipulated in the national plan, and mobilize commune members to discuss democratically and rationally arrange the grain and cotton planting area. How much cotton to plant and how much grain to plant in a production team; which plot of land to plant cotton and which plot of land to plant grain must be fully discussed by the commune members to truly achieve adaptation to local conditions and seek truth from facts, in order to facilitate the double increase of grain and cotton.
    The meeting demanded that all localities further strengthen the leadership over cotton production, continue to adopt the method of combining leading cadres, scientific and technical personnel, and farmers, plant large demonstration plots, lead cotton production, and grasp tightly, firmly, and realistically from beginning to end, from planting to harvesting, one link after another, and grasp to the end. On the basis of leading cadres leading the masses to study Chairman Mao's works diligently and emphasizing politics, fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members, and further carry out the movement of learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and helping each other. Areas and units with roughly the same conditions should determine the objects of learning from, comparing with, catching up with, and helping each other, adopt methods such as "inviting in and sending out," "one-on-one help, one pair of red," "sister competitions, opponent competitions," to learn from each other, help each other, and learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, in order to promote the balanced and substantial increase of cotton production. The meeting demanded that all localities continue to focus on farmland capital construction centered on soil, fertilizer, and water, better implement the "Eight-Character Constitution for Agriculture," vigorously promote advanced cotton-planting experience, improved cotton seeds, and new scientific and technological achievements, and strengthen field management and pest and disease prevention and control, in order to ensure the continued increase in cotton production this year.
    The meeting also emphasized that all localities should be fully prepared ideologically to fight against various possible natural disasters, especially in the northern cotton-growing areas, to prepare to grow cotton well in the event of continued drought. In the struggle against disasters, it is necessary to vigorously mobilize the masses, rely on the collective wisdom and strength of the masses, fully use the rich experience gained in previous disaster relief struggles, effectively use the support of all walks of life, and do everything possible to overcome disasters and strive for high cotton yields and dual grain and cotton harvests.

    国务院召开棉花生产会议总结大幅度增产经验
    号召棉区力争今年粮棉双丰收
    会议要求各地继续高举毛泽东思想红旗，进一步突出政治，发扬大寨精神，为革命种棉，用革命精神种棉，乘胜前进！
    新华社八日讯　我国棉花产区广大社员和干部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，连续夺得棉花大幅度增产。国务院最近召开全国第五次棉花生产会议，全面地总结了棉花大幅度增产的经验，并号召棉区广大干部和社员，继续鼓足革命干劲，进一步开展比学赶帮超运动，力争一九六六年粮棉双丰收。
    周恩来、朱德、邓小平等党和国家领导人接见了参加会议的代表，周恩来总理、李先念、谭震林副总理在会上做了重要报告。周恩来总理还听取了一部分棉花生产成绩显著的地区、单位的代表，包括农业和供销部门的领导干部、植棉能手和科学技术人员的汇报，并同他们就当前棉花生产中的一些重大关键问题进行了座谈。代表们受到巨大鼓舞，一致表示要坚决响应党的号召，再接再厉，力争全面超额完成第三个五年建设计划第一年的棉花生产任务。
          棉花生产发展的新形势
    出席这次会议的代表来自十九个省、市、自治区的三百五十八个县，共七百多人，比前次会议增加了九十一个县的代表。参加这次会议代表的广泛性，显示出我国棉花生产发展的新形势。
    会议上提供的大量材料表明，去年全国棉花生产实现了第四次全国棉花生产会议提出的奋斗目标，从而使我国棉花生产达到了一个新的水平，总产量和单位面积产量都是历史上最高的。全国不论南方棉区或北方棉区，老棉区或新棉区，集中产棉区或分散产棉区，普遍增产，并涌现了平均亩产皮棉百斤以上的省、市和专区，百斤皮棉县比前一年成倍增加，还出现了一些平均亩产皮棉二百斤的社队。
    会议反映了去年我国棉花增产的一些鲜明特点，其中主要是面积大、原来产量比较低的北方棉区，棉花单位产量开始大幅度增长。河北、山东、河南、陕西、辽宁、新疆、北京等省、区、市都大幅度或较大幅度增产。山西省在遭到严重干旱的情况下，全省棉田平均亩产量仍增加一成以上。其次是长江流域原来棉花产量比较高的地区产量持续上升。一九六四年平均亩产量就突破百斤皮棉大关的浙江省和上海市郊区，去年棉花单产又有新的提高。在南方棉区中植棉面积最大的湖北、江苏两省，也取得了重大成就。湖北省棉花总产量再次跃居全国首位。江苏省虽然在棉花生长的关键时期持续遭受台风阴雨等较严重的自然灾害，但除个别地区减产外，南通、苏州等大多数地区仍然增产。江西、安徽、四川等省也有较显著的增产。第三个特点是粮棉双丰收的红旗举得更高，粮棉双高产的县增加了。其中有南方的，也有北方的。突出的有江苏的常熟、启东、太仓、沙洲、靖江，湖北的新洲、黄冈、浠水，上海的南汇、奉贤、嘉定、崇明，浙江的平湖、余姚、海盐、上虞、镇海，河北的藁城、乐亭、无极，陕西的武功和北京的平谷、通县等。这些县的棉花和粮食平均亩产量都达到或超过“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标。另外，还有一些原来粮食不能自给的集中产棉县，改变了过去“国家供给粮食，农民种棉花”的状况，在棉花继续高产的情况下，做到粮食自给或自给有余。在这些县当中，成绩突出的是湖北天门。去年这个县生产皮棉九十二万担，同时上缴粮食一千五百万斤，出售食油十一万多担。第四个特点是高产典型越来越多。去年全国四面八方、东西南北的棉区，都出现了大面积的高产单位和创造高产纪录的尖子社队。东自上海，西到新疆，北自辽宁，南到云南，都有了亩产皮棉百斤以上的高产单位。特别可喜的是我国最北部棉区、无霜期短的辽宁省朝阳专区，出现了平均亩产近百斤的县和亩产超双百斤的生产队。这个专区的建昌县玲珑塔公社白塔子大队，去年种的三百七十五亩棉花，平均亩产皮棉一百九十斤。这个大队的第四、第六两个生产队亩产皮棉超过二百斤。第五个特点是植棉地区有新发展。原来不种棉或很少种棉的广东、福建等省和湖南省部分粮产区，都在前几年试种成功的基础上，开始有计划地扩大试种范围和植棉面积，并出现了一些高产典型。这表明我国适宜种棉的地区是广阔的，棉区可以继续扩展。
    会议指出，去年棉花增产的这些特点，不仅生动地反映出我国当前棉花生产的大好形势，而且也显示我国发展棉花生产的潜力巨大，大有可为。会议表扬了一批棉花生产成绩特别突出的单位，号召各地认真学习和推广它们的先进经验，以它们为榜样，大力开展比学赶帮超的群众运动，把我国棉花生产再推进到一个新的水平。
        棉花大幅度增产的原因是什么
    会议认真地分析了去年棉花大幅度增产的原因，一致认为我国棉花生产的连年大幅度增产，是广大棉区社员和干部，大学毛主席著作，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出政治，深入开展阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动的结果。去年，各棉区的干部和社员，在大学毛主席著作中，联系自己的思想实际和生产实际，用一分为二的观点，认真总结了前几年棉花的增产经验，本着打了胜仗找缺点的精神，找差距、查漏洞、挖潜力，破除了一部分人因为棉花连年丰收而产生的“增产到顶”等故步自封思想，树立雄心大志，以心怀祖国、放眼世界的革命精神广泛开展比学赶帮超的群众运动，力争棉花高产再高产，低产变高产。各棉区普遍推行了领导干部、科学技术人员和农民三结合建立样板田的经验，以样板田带动一般棉田，因地制宜地推广各项植棉先进经验。南方许多棉区还用“请进来，派出去”的办法，从棉花高产区聘请植棉能手担任技术员，指导本地农民种棉，或派人到高产单位学习植棉经验。有些地区的领导干部还拜植棉能手为师，跟班种田，带头学习和推广先进经验。凡是这样做的地区，棉花都大幅度增产。由于领导干部带头，深入发动群众，采用切实可行的办法，使棉花高产地区、高产单位的先进经验，得到普及和提高，从而推动广大棉区形成了一个你追我赶、一浪高一浪的比学赶帮超运动。同时，各行各业，特别是商业供销部门、工业交通和科学文教卫生部门，面向农村，有力地支援了棉花生产。会议在总结思想革命带动棉花大幅度增产经验的同时，也系统地总结了我国科学工作者和农民在棉花生产中所创造的一整套技术经验。
      今年棉花生产的新任务
    在总结和交流去年棉花大幅度增产经验的基础上，会议提出了今年全国棉花生产的新任务。会议要求各产棉区社员和干部继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步突出政治，发扬大寨精神，为革命种棉，用革命精神种棉，乘胜前进，高产地区争取更高产，低产地区要在去年增产的基础上争取大幅度的增产。会议强调指出，必须正确地贯彻执行党和国家有关发展棉花生产的方针政策，干劲要足，步子要稳，特别要注意正确处理粮棉关系，产棉地区要进一步贯彻以粮为纲，粮棉并举的方针，以粮保棉，以棉促粮，力争粮棉双丰收。各地还应当在抓好集中产棉区棉花生产的同时，因地制宜地、有计划地、有步骤地发展分散棉区和新棉区的棉花生产。过去不产棉的地区，要提倡在有条件的地方，由生产队试种少量棉花。会议要求各地必须保证落实国家计划规定的植棉面积，并且要发动社员民主讨论，合理安排粮棉种植面积。在一个生产队里种多少棉花，种多少粮食；那块地种棉，那块地种粮，一定要经过社员群众充分讨论，真正做到因地制宜，实事求是，以利于粮棉双增产。
    会议要求各地进一步加强对棉花生产的领导，继续采用领导干部、科学技术人员和农民三结合的办法，大种样板田，领导棉花生产，并且要从头到尾，从种到收，一环扣一环，抓紧、抓狠、抓实，一抓到底。在领导干部带动群众大学毛主席著作，突出政治的基础上，充分地调动广大社员的生产积极性，进一步开展比学赶帮超的运动。条件大体相同的地区、单位，都要确定比学赶帮超的对象，采用“请进来，派出去”、“一帮一，一对红”“姐妹赛，对手赛”等办法，互学互帮，取长补短，以促进棉花生产平衡而又大幅度的增产。会议要求各地继续狠抓以土、肥、水为中心的农田基本建设，更好地贯彻“农业八字宪法”，大力推广先进的植棉经验、优良棉种和新的科学技术成果，加强田间管理和病虫害的防治工作，以保证今年棉花生产的持续增产。
    会议还强调指出，各地应当有充分的思想准备，同可能发生的各种自然灾害作斗争，尤其是北方棉区，要准备在继续干旱的情况下种好棉花。在抗灾斗争中，要大力发动群众，依靠群众的集体智慧和力量，充分运用以往抗灾斗争取得的丰富经验，有效地利用各行各业的支援，千方百计地战胜灾害，争取棉花高产和粮棉双丰收。
