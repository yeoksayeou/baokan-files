    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 31st: The Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Federation and the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce issued statements on the 30th and 29th respectively, condemning the U.S. nuclear-powered warships for carrying out war intimidation and nuclear blackmail in Hong Kong.

    In its statement, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Federation firmly protested against U.S. warships coming to Hong Kong and demanded that U.S. warships immediately withdraw from Hong Kong. The statement said that U.S. warships are universally detested harbingers of misfortune. The "Enterprise" and "Bainbridge" are even more so, covered in the blood of the Vietnamese people. Now these harbingers of misfortune are openly carrying out war intimidation in Hong Kong, which cannot but arouse the anger of workers and compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

    In its statement, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Federation strongly condemned and protested against the frequent visits of U.S. warships, airplanes, and military personnel to Hong Kong, which have brought serious disasters to Hong Kong residents. The statement emphasized: "On September 1st last year, our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the British government, strongly protesting against Britain allowing the U.S. aggressor troops to use Hong Kong as a base for aggression, and resolutely demanding that effective measures be taken immediately to stop all activities of the U.S. aggressor troops in Hong Kong and stop turning Hong Kong into an activity base for the U.S. aggressor troops. This strong protest from our government has won the support of the broad masses of workers and compatriots in Hong Kong." The statement asked: "Now that the British authorities in Hong Kong are allowing U.S. aggressor troops and military aircraft and warships, stained with the blood of the Vietnamese people, to operate in Hong Kong, are the British authorities in Hong Kong providing Hong Kong to the United States for use as a base for aggression?"

    The statement from the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce condemned the British authorities in Hong Kong for allowing U.S. nuclear-powered warships to come to Hong Kong, turning Hong Kong into an activity base for the war of aggression against Vietnam. The statement pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong should seriously consider this incident.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, February 1st: The U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and the nuclear-powered cruiser "Bainbridge" left Hong Kong this morning amidst strong protests from people of all walks of life. The U.S. warships that left Hong Kong on the same day also included the destroyer "Hawkins," the "Robert H. McCard," and the oiler "Caliente." According to Hong Kong newspapers, these U.S. warships will sail to the waters near Vietnam to continue their sinful acts of slaughtering the Vietnamese people.

    Before the "Enterprise" and "Bainbridge" and other ships left Hong Kong, another U.S. frigate, the "Hissem," and an ammunition transport ship, the "Haleakala," sailed into Hong Kong. As of 5:00 p.m. on February 1st, there were still six U.S. warships lingering in Hong Kong.

    港九工会联合会和香港中华总商会发表声明
    谴责英国让美军利用香港作侵略基地
    美国两艘核动力军舰在各界人民强烈抗议声中离开香港
    据新华社香港三十一日电  港九工会联合会和香港中华总商会，分别在三十日和二十九日就美国核动力军舰在香港进行战争恫吓和核讹诈发表声明。
    港九工会联合会在声明中坚决抗议美国军舰来香港，并且要求美国军舰立即撤离香港。声明说，美国战舰是人见人憎的瘟神，“企业号”和“班布里奇号”更是满身沾满越南人民鲜血的瘟神，现在这些瘟神又在香港公然进行战争恫吓，这不能不引起港九工人同胞的愤怒。
    港九工会联合会在声明中强烈谴责和抗议美国军舰、飞机和军人频频来港，给香港居民带来了严重灾祸。声明强调说：“去年九月一日我国外交部曾照会英国政府，强烈抗议英国容许美国侵略军利用香港作为侵略基地，坚决要求立即采取有效措施，制止美国侵略军在香港的一切活动，停止把香港变成为美国侵略军的活动基地。我国政府的这一强烈抗议，获得了香港广大工人和同胞的拥护和支持。”声明问道：“现在香港英国当局竟容许满身沾染越南人民鲜血的美国侵略军和军机舰只来港活动，香港英国当局是不是把香港提供美国用作侵略基地？”
    香港中华总商会的声明中谴责香港英国当局允许美国核动力军舰开来香港，将香港作为侵越战争的活动基地。声明指出，香港英国当局应该严重考虑这一事件。
    据新华社香港一日电　美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”和核动力巡洋舰“班布里奇号”，在各界人民的强烈抗议声中于今天早晨离开了香港。同一天离开香港的美国军舰，还有驱逐舰“霍金斯号”、“罗伯特斯号”和运油舰“卡连特号”。据香港报纸透露，这些美国军舰将开往接近越南的海域，继续进行屠杀越南人民的罪恶勾当。
    在“企业号”和“班布里奇号”等舰离开香港前，又有一艘美国护卫舰“希杉号”和一艘军火运输舰“哈拉克拉号”开进香港。到二月一日下午五时，还有六艘美国军舰赖在香港。
