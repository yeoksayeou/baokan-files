    U.S. Imperialism Attempts to Permanently Occupy Our Country's Taiwan, Expanding the War of Aggression in Asia
    U.S.-Chiang Clique Illegally Sign "Status of Forces Agreement" for U.S. Troops Stationed in Taiwan
    Our government has long declared that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has no right to sign any treaty with any country. The so-called "Status of Forces Agreement" for U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan signed by the U.S. and Chiang is nothing more than a piece of waste paper.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 13th: The so-called "Status of Forces Agreement" for U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan, illegally signed by U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, has recently been "passed" by the Chiang gang's "Legislative Yuan" and is awaiting Chiang Kai-shek's "approval" and promulgation. This is a heinous measure by U.S. imperialism to permanently occupy China's territory of Taiwan and turn it into a base for the U.S. to expand its war of aggression in Asia. It is also another serious crime by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, following its illegal signing of the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the U.S. in 1954, to sell out national interests.
    This aggressive "agreement" stipulates that U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan (including U.S. military personnel, civilian unit personnel, and their families, hereinafter referred to as the same) have the right to use Taiwan's "land and existing facilities" for the needs of carrying out aggressive war. The U.S. military authorities stationed in Taiwan also have the right to "designate certain areas" where only "personnel authorized" by the U.S. military commander are allowed to enter. This legalizes the privileges of the U.S. military to station troops in Taiwan and delineate occupied areas. In the future, the U.S. aggressor troops can not only arbitrarily enter Taiwan, but also arbitrarily delineate occupied areas, turning Taiwan into a military base for the U.S. to expand its war of aggression in Asia.
    The "agreement" also stipulates that the U.S. troops stationed in the occupied areas have the right to "take all necessary measures" to "guard" the "order and security" within the occupied areas. This allows the U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan to arbitrarily massacre Taiwanese compatriots and commit atrocities at any time in the name of "guarding". The "agreement" stipulates that if U.S. military personnel stationed in Taiwan outside the occupied areas commit crimes while performing "official duties," the Chiang gang shall not interfere, and whether it is "official duties" or not "shall be determined in accordance with U.S. law." Although the "agreement" mentions that the Chiang gang can "try" if the offending U.S. military personnel are not performing so-called "official duties," the criminals must be handed over to the U.S. military authorities stationed in Taiwan for "custody." This is, in effect, recognizing that the U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan enjoy military jurisdiction in Taiwan, allowing U.S. military criminals to go unpunished under any circumstances.
    In order to further colonize Taiwan, the "agreement" stipulates that U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan also enjoy the privilege of being exempt from the Chiang gang's "passport visa law" and "foreigner registration law." This is equivalent to acknowledging that U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan are completely free to enter, leave, or permanently reside in Taiwan in the future, and the Chiang gang cannot interfere at all. The "agreement" also stipulates that U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan enjoy tax exemption, the right to set up post offices, and the right to demand so-called "damage" compensation, facilitating their arbitrary plunder of the Taiwanese people and large-scale smuggling.
    What is particularly noteworthy is that this "agreement" stipulates that the "agreement" "shall continue to be in effect during the effective period" of the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" illegally signed between the U.S. and Chiang, and that the "treaty" is valid indefinitely. This legalizes the U.S. imperialism's permanent occupation of Taiwan.
    At a time when U.S. imperialism is shifting the focus of its counter-revolutionary global strategy from Europe to Asia, signing such an aggressive agreement with the Chiang Kai-shek clique is clearly out of the need to expand its war of aggression in Vietnam and Indochina, and attempting to further turn Taiwan into its colony and base of aggression. The day after the Chiang gang's "Legislative Yuan" "passed" this "agreement" on January 11, an Associated Press dispatch from Taipei undisguisedly stated: "After the Legislative Yuan (of the Chiang gang) approved the agreement stipulating the status of U.S. troops, the last obstacle to the massive entry of U.S. troops into Formosa (referring to Taiwan) was cleared." It was also around this time that the United States began to expand military bases in Taiwan on a large scale and transferred large numbers of aggressor troops and aircraft to Taiwan.
    Our government solemnly declared as early as December 8, 1954: "The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has no right to sign any treaty with any country." The so-called "Status of Forces Agreement" for U.S. troops stationed in Taiwan signed by the U.S. and Chiang this time is nothing more than a piece of waste paper. The attempt by U.S. imperialism to use this "agreement" to turn Taiwan into a base for expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

### 美帝国主义妄图永久霸占我国台湾，在亚洲扩大侵略战争  美蒋非法签订侵台美军“地位协定”

    美帝国主义妄图永久霸占我国台湾，在亚洲扩大侵略战争
    美蒋非法签订侵台美军“地位协定”
    我国政府早经宣布，蒋匪帮无权同任何国家签订任何条约。美蒋签订的侵台美军所谓“地位协定”，只不过是一张废纸。
    新华社十三日讯　美帝国主义和蒋介石集团非法签订的侵台美军所谓“地位协定”，最近已被蒋帮“立法院”“通过”，正待蒋介石“批准”公布。这是美帝国主义妄图永久霸占中国领土台湾，把它变为美国在亚洲扩大侵略战争的基地的一个罪恶措施，也是蒋介石集团继一九五四年同美国非法签订所谓“共同防御条约”以来，又一个出卖民族利益的严重罪行。
    这个侵略“协定”规定，侵台美军（包括美军人员、文职单位人员及其家属，下同）为了进行侵略战争的需要，有权使用台湾的“地面及现存设备”；侵台美军当局还有权“指定若干地区”，只许美军司令官“授权之人员”进入。这就使美国在台湾驻军和划定占领区的特权合法化。今后美国侵略军不仅可以任意开进台湾，而且还可以任意划定占领区，把台湾变成美国在亚洲扩大侵略战争的军事基地。
    “协定”还规定，进驻占领区的侵台美军有权“采取一切必要措施”，“警卫”占领区内的“秩序及安全”。这就使侵台美军随时可以借“警卫”之名，任意屠杀台湾同胞和为非作歹。“协定”中规定，占领区以外的侵台美军人员执行“公务”时犯了罪，蒋帮不得过问，而是否为“公务”则“应依美国法律予以认定”。如犯罪的美军人员并不是在执行所谓“公务”，“协定”虽然提到蒋帮可以“审判”，但犯人必须交由侵台美军当局“看管”。这实际上是承认侵台美军在台湾享有军事裁判权，使侵台美军罪犯在任何情况下都可以逍遥法外。
    为了使台湾进一步殖民地化，“协定”规定，侵台美军还享有免受蒋帮“护照签证法”和“外人登记法”管理的特权。这等于承认侵台美军今后无论进入、离开或永久居住于台湾，都完全自由，蒋帮一概不能过问。“协定”还规定侵台美军享有免税权、设置邮局权以及要求所谓“损害”赔偿等特权，便于他们任意掠夺台湾人民和大量走私。
    尤其值得注意的是，这个“协定”竟规定，“协定”在美蒋非法签订的所谓“共同防御条约”的“有效期间继续生效”，而该“条约”是无限期有效的。从而使美帝国主义永久霸占台湾合法化。
    美帝国主义在把它的反革命全球战略重点从欧洲转向亚洲的时候，同蒋介石集团签订这样一个侵略协定，显然是出于扩大侵略越南和印度支那战争的需要，妄图把台湾进一步变为它的殖民地和侵略基地。就在蒋帮“立法院”一月十一日“通过”这个“协定”的第二天，美联社从台北发出的一则消息就毫不掩饰地说：“在（蒋帮）立法院批准了规定美军地位的协定之后，美国军队大量进驻福摩萨（指台湾）的最后一个障碍被清除了。”也正是在这前后，美国开始在台湾大规模地扩建军事基地，并把大批侵略军队和飞机陆续调进台湾。
    我国政府早在一九五四年十二月八日就严正宣布：“蒋介石卖国集团没有任何权利同任何国家签订任何条约。”美蒋这次签订的侵台美军所谓“地位协定”只不过是一张废纸。美帝国主义企图利用这个“协定”把台湾变为它扩大侵越战争的基地，这是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
