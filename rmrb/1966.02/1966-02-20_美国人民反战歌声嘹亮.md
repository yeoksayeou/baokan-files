    (Our dispatch) The tide of American people opposing the war of aggression against Vietnam is rising daily. Some anti-war songs that people sing during demonstrations and marches are very popular in the United States. Now these songs have spread abroad and are popular with the public in London and Tokyo. Excerpts from these lyrics are as follows:
    《Eve of Destruction》
  “Asia, is a land about to explode,
  There, violence is rampant, shells are roaring.
  Boy, even though you are old enough to vote,
  You are still too young to kill.
  Since you don't support this war,
  Then why pick up a gun and fight to the death?"
      《Where Have All the Flowers Gone》
  “Where have all the young men gone?
  They have all gone to soldiers.
  What is this for? Where have all the soldiers gone?
  They have all gone to the graves. What is the point?"
     《Johnson》
  "Johnson, is just like Hitler back then,
  His mouth always babbles about one thing,
  That is: Kill them! Also kill them!"

    美国人民反战歌声嘹亮
    本报讯　美国人民反对侵越战争的浪潮日益高涨，人们在示威游行时高唱的一些反战的歌曲在美国国内大为流行。现在这些歌曲已经流传国外，在伦敦、东京受到公众的欢迎。这些歌词的片段如下：
    《毁灭的前夜》
  “亚洲，是个即将爆炸的地方，
  那里，暴力横行，炮弹轰鸣。小伙子，虽然你已到了投票的年龄，
  要论杀人你还显得太年轻。既然你不拥护这场战争，
  那么，为什么要拿起枪去拼命？”
      《花儿消失在何方》
  “青年人，都到哪儿去了？
  他们都去当兵。
  这是为了什么呢？士兵们，都到哪儿去了？他们都进了坟墓。这又是何苦呢？”
     《约翰逊》
  “约翰逊，活象当年的希特勒，
  他的嘴巴总是唠叨一件事，
  那就是：杀死他们！还要杀死他们！”
