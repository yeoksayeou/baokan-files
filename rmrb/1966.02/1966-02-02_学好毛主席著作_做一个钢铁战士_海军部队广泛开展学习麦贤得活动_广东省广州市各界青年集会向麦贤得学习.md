    Study Chairman Mao's Writings, Be a Steel Warrior
    Naval Forces Widely Carry Out Activities to Learn from Mai Xiande
    Youths from All Walks of Life in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province Gather to Learn from Mai Xiande
    (Xinhua News Agency, February 1st) The naval forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are widely carrying out activities to learn from the steel warrior Mai Xiande. From offices to troops, from airfields to warships, commanders and fighters in every battle position are taking Mai Xiande's revolutionary heroic spirit of resolutely overcoming all enemies in battle as an example, determined to continue to highlight politics, strengthen combat readiness, and, like Mai Xiande, study and apply Chairman Mao's writings creatively, ready at any time to eliminate enemies who dare to invade.
    During the learning activities, the broad masses of commanders and fighters deeply realized from Mai Xiande's heroic battle deeds and his notes on studying Chairman Mao's writings that the main reason Mai Xiande was able to stand firm on the battlefield was that his revolutionary thought was strong, and the fundamental reason his thought was strong was that he persevered in studying and applying Chairman Mao's writings creatively, especially focusing on the "application" aspect, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm his mind.
    Mai Xiande's revolutionary fighting will to keep fighting in one breath and his proletarian hard-bone spirit have given great education and encouragement to the broad masses of commanders and fighters. Many people are determined to take Mai Xiande as an example, fearing neither heaven nor earth, daring to trample all difficulties and all enemies under their feet.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 31st) More than 5,000 youths from all walks of life in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held a meeting today to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the steel warrior Mai Xiande.
    During the meeting, a youth delegation from all walks of life dispatched by the meeting went to the hospital to meet with Mai Xiande. During the meeting, the delegation members asked Mai Xiande to write an inscription, and he wrote the five characters "Long Live Chairman Mao" neatly with his left hand, once again expressing his heartfelt love for the great leader of our people, Chairman Mao.
    After the meeting, the delegation rushed to the venue and reported the process of meeting Mai Xiande to the youths from all walks of life, and the whole audience cheered. When the "Long Live Chairman Mao" written by Mai Xiande on paper was raised, the applause continued for a long time. Some young people said at the meeting that they must, like Mai Xiande, study Chairman Mao's writings hard, focus on the "application" aspect, keep class hatred in their hearts at all times, and combine labor with military affairs. If American imperialism dares to impose war on us, we will, together with the people of the whole country, resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the enemy.

    学好毛主席著作　做一个钢铁战士
    海军部队广泛开展学习麦贤得活动广东省
    广州市各界青年集会向麦贤得学习
    据新华社一日讯　中国人民解放军海军各部队，广泛开展向钢铁战士麦贤得学习的活动。从机关到部队，从机场到舰艇，各个战斗岗位上的指战员，都以麦贤得在战斗中坚决压倒一切敌人的革命英雄气概为榜样，决心继续突出政治，加强战备，象麦贤得那样活学活用毛主席著作，时刻准备消灭敢于来犯的敌人。
    在学习活动中，广大指战员从麦贤得的英勇战斗事迹和他学习毛主席著作的笔记里，深刻认识到，麦贤得所以能在战场上过得硬，主要原因是他的革命思想过得硬，他的思想所以过得硬，根本原因又在于他坚持不懈地活学活用毛主席著作，特别在“用”字上狠下功夫，用毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑。
    麦贤得有一口气就要战斗下去的革命斗争意志和无产阶级硬骨头精神，给了广大指战员很大的教育和鼓舞。许多人决心以麦贤得为榜样，天不怕，地不怕，敢把一切困难、一切敌人踩在脚下。
    据新华社广州三十一日电广东省、广州市各界青年五千多人，今天举行集会，学习钢铁战士麦贤得的革命精神。
    大会进行中，由大会派出的各界青年代表团，前往医院会见麦贤得。会见时，代表团人员请麦贤得题词，他用左手端端正正地写了“毛主席万岁”五个大字，再一次表达了他无限热爱我国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的心愿。
    会见结束后，代表团赶到会场，向各界青年报告了会见麦贤得的经过，全场欢腾。当举起麦贤得写在纸上的“毛主席万岁”时，掌声经久不息。一些青年在会上表示，一定要象麦贤得那样，努力学习毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，做到心里时刻装着阶级仇，做到劳武结合。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，我们就和全国人民一道，坚决彻底把敌人消灭掉。
