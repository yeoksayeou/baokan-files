    Creating the Future with Revolutionary Ambition
    Ouyang Yi

    Martyr Ouyang Hai was my childhood playmate, we grew up together. Even as a child, he had great ambition, and after growing up, under the Party's education and cultivation, he became a staunch revolutionary fighter. After reading "Ouyang Hai's Song," I received a great education. This is a book that encourages young people to strive for progress.

    Ouyang Hai had a strong class feeling for the cause of revolution and construction, and a high sense of revolutionary responsibility. He deeply understood that today's socialist construction is to change the face of our country's poverty and backwardness, to fight against imperialism, to fight against revisionism, and to support the world people's revolution. It was precisely this realization that enabled him to overcome his physical limitations and display such tenacious revolutionary perseverance and such high revolutionary enthusiasm in the battle to build railways while ill. Ouyang Hai's revolutionary sense of responsibility has given us great encouragement. Currently, we are constructing a ten-li long canal. The young people of Ouyang Hai's hometown, reading "Ouyang Hai's Song" and discussing Ouyang Hai's heroic deeds, have expressed their determination: we must use the same spirit as Ouyang Hai, who laid railways for the national defense factory while ill, to build our canal. The canal project is extremely arduous, with cliffs, steep slopes, and thorny bushes everywhere. However, recalling the moving scene of Ouyang Hai working hard while ill on the railway construction site, carrying heavy burdens and shouting "Hold high the revolutionary red flag and work hard!", we feel that no difficulty is insurmountable. When there is no place to stand on the steep slopes, we use the method of suspending people in the air, tying one end of the rope to a tree and the other end to a person's waist, and chiseling axe blow by axe blow on the steep slope. After more than twenty days of hard work, the foundation of the canal has been initially completed. In order to complete the canal project ahead of schedule, the young people are vigorous, full of fighting spirit, take the lead in everything, do not stop work in the cold wind and drizzle, and do not miss work unless there are special circumstances, and still go to work during the Spring Festival. Everyone is thinking of building the canal as soon as possible, changing the drought-stricken face of their hometown for thousands of years, and increasing grain production substantially. In the past, our brigade had to ask the state for grain every year. After the canal is built, we will not only strive to be self-sufficient within three to five years, but also strive to have surplus grain to sell to the state. We understand that we cannot rely on anything else to control mountains and rivers, but only on Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary ambition like Ouyang Hai.

    以革命的志气创造未来
    欧阳义
    欧阳海烈士是我童年的伙伴，在一起玩大的。小时候他就很有志气，长大后，在党的教育培养下，成了一个坚强的革命战士。看了《欧阳海之歌》，受到了很大的教育，这是一部鼓舞青年上进的书。
    欧阳海对革命和建设事业有着强烈的阶级感情，有着高度的革命责任感。他深深懂得，今天的社会主义建设，是为了改变祖国一穷二白的面貌，是为了跟帝国主义斗争，跟修正主义斗争，是为了支援世界人民革命。正是意识到了这一点，使他突破了生理的限度，在带病修建铁路的战斗中，表现了那样顽强的革命毅力，显示了那样高度的战斗热忱。欧阳海这种革命责任感，给了我们极大的鼓舞。现在，我们正在施工修建一条十里长的渠道。欧阳海家乡的青年读着《欧阳海之歌》，谈论着欧阳海的英雄事迹，纷纷表示决心：一定要以欧阳海带病为国防工厂铺设铁路那样的精神，来修建我们的渠道。渠道的工程非常艰巨，到处悬崖陡壁，荆棘丛林。但是，想起欧阳海在铁路工地上带病苦干，挑着重担高喊“高举革命红旗，干哪！”的动人情景，我们觉得什么困难都不在话下了。在陡壁上施工没有站脚的地方，就用空中吊人的办法，用绳子一头绑在树上，一头系在人腰上，在陡壁上一斧一斧地凿。经过二十多天的奋战，渠道的基础已经初步修成。为了提前完成渠道工程，青年们龙腾虎跃，斗志昂扬，事事带头，寒风细雨不停工，没有特殊事情不误工，春节期间照样上工。大伙儿一心想的是早日把渠道修好，改变家乡千百年来的干旱面貌，大幅度地增产粮食。以往，我们大队年年要向国家要粮食，渠道修成后，在三、五年内，我们不仅要争取做到自给自足，而且要争取有余粮卖给国家。我们懂得，治山治水不能靠别的，只能靠毛泽东思想，靠欧阳海那样的革命志气。
