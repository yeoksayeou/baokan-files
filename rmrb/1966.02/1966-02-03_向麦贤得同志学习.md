    Learning from Comrade Mai Xiande
    Comrade Mai Xiande's heroic deeds have aroused great repercussions among the vast readership. They believe that Mai Xiande, like Lei Feng and Wang Jie, is a role model for everyone to learn from; the source of Mai Xiande's noble qualities and heroic behavior is Mao Zedong Thought. Below are excerpts from several letters from PLA soldiers: Editor
    
    Armed with Mao Zedong Thought
    After reading about Mai Xiande's heroic deeds, I thought about a question: Mai Xiande is a 21-year-old young man who has been in the army for less than two years. Why was he able to create such an amazing miracle? Is it based on a moment's impetuous courage? Absolutely not.
    Mai Xiande's revolutionary hard-bone spirit of overwhelming all enemies was tempered by Mao Zedong Thought in peacetime. Without the hard-bone Mai Xiande in ordinary work and life, there would be no hard-bone Mai Xiande who persisted in fighting for three hours with serious injuries on the battlefield.
                                Combat Hero Yang Daogen
    In the past, I had an idea: even if I'm usually careless, I'll be reliable in wartime. Mai Xiande's heroic behavior is the result of his flexible application of Chairman Mao's works with class feelings; it is also inseparable from strict demands on himself and strict training in peacetime. If you don't demand strictness and strenuous training in peacetime, you won't be reliable at the critical moment of war. If you are reluctant to shed a drop of sweat in peacetime production labor, how can you be willing to shed blood and sacrifice in wartime? Soldier Wang Rusong
    
    As Brave as "Old Generals"
    Our Steel Eighth Company of the "Tower Hill Hero Regiment" was full of good men during the war years. However, those "old generals" are no longer in the company. If there is a war in the future, can we "young generals" complete the task? After reading Mai Xiande's heroic deeds, my heart suddenly brightened: fighting a war is not only about experience, but more importantly, about people's courage. In the past, I had concerns because I lacked Mai Xiande's fearless proletarian hard-bone spirit and the ambition of the proletarian descendants. In the future, I will take Mai Xiande as an example, not be afraid in the face of strong enemies, and not bow my head in the face of difficulties, and make contributions to the motherland and the people of the world by killing the enemy. New Soldier Shen Zuwei
    This year, our class has been supplemented with some new soldiers. I am worried that they are young, not very tall, and their military skills are not strong enough. If there is a war, they will not be able to complete the task. Mai Xiande's heroic deeds tell me that fighting a war does not only depend on technology and physical strength, but more importantly on people's class consciousness and courage. In terms of technology and naval warfare experience, Mai Xiande is not strong; in terms of age, he is a young man. He was able to persist in fighting and create miracles entirely by relying on Mao Zedong Thought and his revolutionary red heart. A soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought, even if he is a new soldier, can still win battles.
                          Squad Leader Liu Biaolin
    I am a new soldier who joined the army this year. When I first arrived at the company, the instructor said: "We are revolutionary soldiers holding guns, and we must be ready for battle at any time." I couldn't understand it: I just learned how to fire a gun, and I don't know anything about the six major techniques of infantry. When I go to the battlefield, what can I rely on to eliminate the enemy?
    The class organized a study of Mai Xiande's deeds, and I was shocked: my previous idea was wrong. Military technology is an important factor in eliminating the enemy, but it is not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is the degree of people's awareness. Establishing the idea of fighting for all the Chinese and the people of the world is a huge and invincible force.
                          New Soldier Deng Danian
    In the past, I didn't deeply understand why my brother Luo Guangxie could sacrifice himself to continuously roll thunder [explosives]. After reading about Mai Xiande's deeds, I realized that the power of courage is unparalleled. To truly be able to hit accurately, attack successfully, and be invincible, we must arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, like Mai Xiande, and train ourselves into proletarian iron men and hard bones.
                            Soldier Luo Guangting
    
    Strengthen Training to Prepare for Large-Scale and Difficult Battles
    Mai Xiande was "invincible" in his studies and work, and he was "invincible" when he suffered serious head injuries. We learn from Mai Xiande, and we must be "invincible" in the face of all difficulties in our work and study, "invincible" in the face of all reactionaries, and "invincible" in the face of American imperialism.
                Soldier Zhang Moqian
    In the hospital, Mai Xiande was in a semi-comatose state. Someone wrote a note asking him: Are you a soldier? His written answer was: "Be ready to eliminate invading enemies at any time." This sentence shows that he has a high sense of combat readiness at all times and in all places; this sentence is the steel will forged by Mao Zedong Thought in the hearts of soldiers, and it is a huge spiritual atomic bomb.
    "Be ready to eliminate invading enemies at any time." This is the responsibility that our soldiers can never forget.
                  Soldier Zheng Xiaoping
    After reading about Mai Xiande's heroic deeds, another tall and heroic image accompanies me onto the training ground and accompanies me in charging. In the attack, I want to be the first to blow up barbed wire and destroy bunkers, thinking of opening a bloody path for the troops, exercising a brave and tenacious fighting will, and laying a solid foundation for fighting big battles, difficult battles, and leading battles in the future.
                  Soldier Jiang Longbang
    
    Working for the Revolution for a Lifetime
    Isn't Lu Xun's famous saying "willing to be an ox for the children" synonymous with "screw" and "volunteer soldier"? The older generation was willing to be revolutionary oxen, and we inherited their spirit and became revolutionary screws and volunteer soldiers. How glorious and heroic this is! Let us serve the people diligently like oxen, and be firmly screwed on the "machine" of the revolution like screws, loyal to ordinary posts, and work for the revolution for a lifetime. Zhang Zhilai
    Mai Xiande's touching deeds have made me further understand what a "volunteer soldier" is, who to fulfill the obligation for, and how to fulfill the obligation.
    Our revolutionary team's volunteer soldiers are volunteer soldiers who serve all the Chinese and the people of the world. Soldier Cai Zongzhou
    Mai Xiande links the three words "volunteer soldier" with the entire communist cause, and will always be a revolutionary volunteer soldier. I originally regarded volunteer soldiers as fulfilling their obligations to the country for a few years, and regarded them as temporary obligations. In the future, however long the motherland lets me do it, I will do it, striving to be a communist volunteer soldier.
                            Soldier Wu Chunming
    We cannot regard volunteer soldiers as having a time limit. Although my term of service has expired, serving the people has no time limit. I want to serve the people wholeheartedly and be a true volunteer soldier.
                                    Bai Junjie
    
    Constantly Advancing in "Not Enough"
    Mai Xiande was approved as a probationary member of the Chinese Communist Party during his hospitalization. When squad leader Huang Rusheng congratulated him, he wrote the two words "not enough."
    "Not enough." The simple two words express Comrade Mai Xiande's spirit of never being complacent and thoroughly carrying out the revolution.
    A revolutionary's service to the people is infinite; to achieve "infinite," one must always feel "not enough." Zhou Laida
    In Mai Xiande's writing, the two words "not enough" are not just ordinary words of modesty, but a prominent manifestation of strictly demanding himself to serve the people wholeheartedly.
    "Not enough," this spirit of continuous revolution promotes the formation of heroic and noble qualities. Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande, they were able to establish a revolutionary outlook on life in a short period of time because they felt "not enough" everywhere and constantly and consciously worked hard to transform their thinking.
                          Director Fan Zhiwei
    "Not enough," what does this thought-provoking word mean? It means the high standards of the revolution. This is the "mirror" of revolutionary soldiers' attitude towards honor. From Lei Feng, Wang Jie to Mai Xiande, they were able to become good soldiers of Chairman Mao because they always saw their own "not enough"; they always used their own "not enough" to flexibly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and constantly advance in "not enough."

### 向麦贤得同志学习

专栏：

    向麦贤得同志学习
    麦贤得同志的英雄事迹，在广大读者中引起了巨大的反响。他们认为：麦贤得和雷锋、王杰一样，是大家学习的榜样；麦贤得的崇高品质和英雄行为的源泉，是毛泽东思想。下面摘登几封来自解放军战士的来信：　　　编者
    用毛泽东思想武装起来
    读了麦贤得的英雄事迹，我考虑到一个问题：麦贤得是一个二十一岁的青年，入伍不到两年，为什么能创造出这样惊人的奇迹呢？是凭一时的血气之勇吗？绝对不是。
    麦贤得这种压倒一切敌人的革命硬骨头精神，是平时用毛泽东思想冶炼出来的。没有在平时工作、生活中的硬骨头麦贤得，也就没有在战场上负重伤坚持战斗三小时的硬骨头麦贤得。
                                战斗英雄　杨道根
    过去我有个想法：别看我平时吊儿郎当，到了战时保险过得硬。麦贤得能有这样的英雄行为，是他带着阶级感情活学活用毛主席著作的结果；也是同平时严格要求自己、严格锻炼自己分不开的。平时不严格要求，不顽强锻炼，到了打仗的节骨眼上是过不了硬的。平时生产劳动舍不得流一点汗，战时那能舍得流血牺牲呢？　战士　汪如松
    象“老将”一样勇敢
    我们“塔山英雄团”钢八连，在战争年代里，个个都是好样的。可是，那些“老将们”都不在连队了，将来打仗，我们这些“小将”能不能完成任务？看了麦贤得的英雄事迹，心里豁然亮堂了：打仗不光是靠经验，更重要的是靠人的勇敢，我过去有顾虑，就是缺少麦贤得那种不怕死的无产阶级硬骨头精神，缺少无产阶级后代的志气。今后我要以麦贤得为榜样，在强敌面前不畏惧，在困难面前不低头，为祖国和世界人民杀敌立功。　　新战士　沈祖慰
    今年我们班补充了一些新战士。我担心他们年纪轻，个头也不大，军事技术还不过硬，打起仗来完不成任务。麦贤得的英雄事迹告诉我，打仗不单是靠技术，靠体力，更主要的是靠人的阶级觉悟，靠人的勇敢精神。论技术，论海战经验，麦贤得并不强；论年纪，他是一个小伙子。他能坚持战斗，创造奇迹，完全是凭毛泽东思想，凭他那颗革命的红心。用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，那怕是一个新战士，照样也能打胜仗。
                          班　长刘　标林
    我是今年入伍的新战士，刚到连队，指导员便说：“我们是手拿枪杆的革命战士，要随时做好战斗准备。”我听了有些想不通：枪才学会放，步兵六大技术，还一窍不通，上了战场，凭什么消灭敌人？
    班里组织学习麦贤得的事迹，我听了不禁一惊：我以前的想法错了。军事技术是消灭敌人的重要因素，但不是决定因素，决定的因素是人的觉悟程度，树立为全中国和全世界人民而战的思想，就是战无不胜的巨大力量。
                          新战士　邓大年
    过去，我对哥哥罗光燮为什么能舍身连续滚雷的英雄行为理解不深。看了麦贤得的事迹，我认识到勇敢精神威力大无比。要真正打得准、攻得上，有我无敌，就要象麦贤得那样，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，把自己锻炼成无产阶级的铁汉子、硬骨头。
                            战士　罗光庭
    加强锻炼　准备打大仗打恶仗
    麦贤得在平时学习和工作中，他“有我无敌”，在头负重伤的时候，他“有我无敌”，我们学习麦贤得，对于我们工作和学习中的一切困难，要“有我无敌”，对一切反动派要“有我无敌”，对美帝国主义也要“有我无敌”。
                战士　张陌阡
    在医院里，麦贤得处于半昏迷状态。有人写纸条问他：你是个战士吗？他写的回答是：“随时准备消灭来犯的敌人。”这句话，表明了他时时处处具有高度的战备观念；这句话，是毛泽东思想在战士心灵上铸成的钢铁意志，是巨大的精神原子弹。
    “随时准备消灭来犯的敌人”，这是我们战士永远不能忘的职责。
                  战士　郑晓平
    看了麦贤得的英雄事迹，又一个高大的英雄形象，伴着我走上练兵场，伴着我打冲锋。进攻中，我要抢着第一名炸铁丝网，爆破地堡，心中想的是为部队杀开一条血路，锻炼勇猛顽强的战斗意志，为今后打大仗、打恶仗、打头仗打下牢固的基础。
                  战士　蒋隆邦
    为革命干一辈子
    鲁迅那句“俯首甘为孺子牛”的名言，不就是“螺丝钉”、“义务兵”的同义语吗？前一辈人甘当革命的孺子牛，我们继承了他们的精神，做革命的螺丝钉、义务兵，这是多么光荣豪迈啊！让我们象牛那样勤勤恳恳为人民服务，象螺丝钉那样牢固地拧在革命的“机器”上，忠于平凡的岗位，为革命干一辈子。　　　张治来
    麦贤得的动人事迹，使我进一步懂得了什么叫“义务兵”，为谁尽义务，怎样尽义务。
    我们革命队伍的义务兵，就是为全中国和全世界人民服务的义务兵。　战士　蔡宗周
    麦贤得把“义务兵”这三个字，同整个共产主义事业联系起来，永远做革命的义务兵。我原先把义务兵只看成是为国家尽几年义务，当做临时的义务。今后祖国让我干多久，就干多久，争当一个共产主义义务兵。
                            战士　吴春明
    不能把义务兵看成是有年限的，我虽然服役期满了，但为人民服务是无年限的，我要全心全意地为人民服务，当一个真正的义务兵。
                                    柏俊杰
    在“不够”中不断前进
    麦贤得在住院期间被批准为中国共产党预备党员。当班长黄汝省向他祝贺时他写下“不够”两个字。
    “不够”。简单的两个字，表达了麦贤得同志永不自满、彻底革命的精神。
    一个革命者为人民服务是无限的；做到“无限”，就得时刻感到“不够”。　　周来达
    在麦贤得的笔下，“不够”二字，不是一般的谦虚词，而是严格要求自己全心全意为人民服务的突出表现。
    “不够”，这种不断革命的精神，促进了英雄高尚品质的形成。雷锋、王杰和麦贤得，他们能在短时间内树立起革命人生观，就是由于他们处处感到“不够”，不断地、自觉地刻苦改造思想的结果。
                          干事　范志伟
    “不够”，这个发人深思的字眼意味着什么呢？它意味着革命的高标准，这是革命战士对待荣誉的“镜子”。从雷锋、王杰到麦贤得，他们能成为毛主席的好战士，就是因为他们总是看到自己的“不够”；总是带着自己的“不够”去活学活用毛主席著作，在“不够”中不断前进。　　　特务连　赵安保　马华亭
