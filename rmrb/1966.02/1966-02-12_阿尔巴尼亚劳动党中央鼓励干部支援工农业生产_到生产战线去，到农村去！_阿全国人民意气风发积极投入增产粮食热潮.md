    Albanian Labor Party Central Committee Encourages Cadres to Support Industrial and Agricultural Production
    Go to the Production Front, Go to the Countryside!
    Albanian People Enthusiastically Participate in the Surge to Increase Grain Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana – A surge to vigorously grasp grain production and send cadres to the countryside to support agriculture is gradually forming throughout Albania.
    After the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers issued a call to vigorously develop agricultural production during the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970) and strive for national self-sufficiency in grain, it was like a spring thunder, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people across the country, and the people of the whole country vigorously plunged into the movement to increase grain production. By the end of last year, 2,340 hectares of land had been reclaimed nationwide (35 percent of the plan). So far, more than 2 million tons of various fertilizers have been collected nationwide. Farmers in many areas are turning the slack winter season into a busy winter, participating intensively in winter field labor. In some mountainous areas, the broad masses of farmers are not afraid of hardship and are reclaiming wasteland and building terraces.
      The Albanian People's Army, with "a rifle in one hand and a pickaxe in the other," has reclaimed 1,150 hectares of land from last year to the present, many of which are located on high mountains at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
    At the same time, the vast number of cadres have expressed their firm response to the call of the Party and the government to go to the places where the Party needs them most, support agriculture, and settle down in production posts. At present, more than 1,000 people have voluntarily signed up to settle down at the grassroots level, including agricultural experts, doctors, political workers, technicians, and literary and art workers. Three hundred cadres in the Durrës district have already gone down to the grassroots level such as agricultural production cooperatives to settle down, working with the members while leading production. Personnel who have voluntarily signed up in other districts are also ready to go to the countryside and to the front line of production.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana – The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party issued a decision on the 1st, warmly supporting the initiative recently proposed by cadres of Party and state organs to step out of their offices, rush to the production front, and support industrial and agricultural production.
    The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party first expressed its gratitude and congratulations to the workers who participated in and enthusiastically supported this highly patriotic initiative. The resolution said that this initiative is a manifestation of the workers' high political consciousness and a manifestation of the healthy worldview of our new generation, who regard labor production as the main front of the country's socialist construction and as the foundation of the Albanian people's welfare and happiness.
    This initiative is a reflection of the revolutionary determination to further strengthen and develop the national economy, and a manifestation of socialist patriotism that defends the motherland and regards the interests of the motherland as higher than everything else.
    The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party instructed that the Party's grassroots organizations and all Communist Party members should always take the lead in publicizing the great significance of this initiative to the broad masses of working people.
    The resolution said that the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Albania has instructed all local state organs and district committees to pay special attention to the volunteers who go to the production front and solve their problems in all aspects such as labor, accommodation, and supply.
    The resolution said that the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party is deeply convinced that the initiative to go to the production front, especially to the countryside, will receive widespread support. (Attached photo)

    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央鼓励干部支援工农业生产
    到生产战线去，到农村去！
    阿全国人民意气风发积极投入增产粮食热潮
    新华社地拉那电　一个大抓粮食生产和干部下乡支援农业的热潮正在阿尔巴尼亚全国各地逐渐形成。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和部长会议关于在第四个五年计划（一九六六——一九七○年）中大力发展农业生产、争取全国粮食自给的号召发出后，象一声春雷，调动了全国广大人民积极性，全国人民意气风发地投入了粮食增产的运动。到去年年底止，全国已开垦出土地二千三百四十公顷（为计划的百分之三十五）。到目前为止，全国已搜集各种肥料二百多万吨。许多地区的农民变冬闲为冬忙，紧张地参加了冬季田间劳动。在一些山区，广大农民更是不畏艰苦，开垦荒地，修筑梯田。
      “一手拿枪，一手拿镐”的阿尔巴尼亚人民军从去年起到现在已经开垦出土地一千一百五十公顷，其中不少土地都位于海拔两千米的高山上。
    与此同时，广大干部纷纷表示坚决响应党和政府的号召，要到党最需要的地方去，支援农业，到生产岗位上安家落户。目前，自愿报名到基层落户的已达一千多人，其中有农业专家、医生、政治工作者、技术人员和文艺工作者。都拉斯区的三百名干部已经下到农业生产合作社等基层落户，一边同社员一起劳动，一边领导生产。其他各区自愿报名的人员也都整装待发，到农村去，到生产第一线上去。
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会一日发表一项决定，热情支持党和国家机关干部最近提出的走出办公室，奔向生产战线，支援工农业生产的倡议。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会首先对参加和热情地支持这一高度爱国主义倡议的劳动者表示感谢和祝贺。决议说，这个倡议是劳动者高度的政治觉悟的表现，是我们一代新人把劳动生产看作是国家社会主义建设的主要战线，是阿尔巴尼亚人民福利和幸福的基础的健康的世界观的表现。
    这一倡议是进一步加强和发展国民经济的革命决心的反映，是保卫祖国、把祖国利益看作高于一切的社会主义爱国主义的表现。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会指示，党的基层组织和所有共产党员永远起带头作用，向广大劳动人民群众宣传这一倡议的伟大意义。
    决议说，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国部长会议责成所有地方国家机关和区委会要特别关心奔赴生产战线的志愿人员，解决他们在劳动、住宿和供应等各方面的问题。
    决议说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央深信，掀起到生产战线，尤其到农村去的倡议将得到广泛的支持。（附图片）
