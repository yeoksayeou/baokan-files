    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th. After studying the articles introducing the deeds of Chairman Mao's good student, Jiao Yulu, and the *People's Daily* editorial, the leading cadres of the Zhongmou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province expressed with revolutionary passion that they must allow Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit to blossom and bear fruit in Zhongmou County. They must lead the people of the entire county like Comrade Jiao Yulu, dedicating everything to changing the face of Zhongmou.
    As soon as the newspapers carrying the newsletter "The Model of a County Party Secretary – Jiao Yulu" and the *People's Daily* editorial "Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, a Good Student of Comrade Mao Zedong" arrived at the County Party Committee, the County Party Committee immediately convened a meeting of the Standing Committee to study them. Everyone was moved by Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit. The Standing Committee members attending the meeting unanimously stated: Comrade Jiao Yulu is indeed our good example. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit, we are far behind. Zhongmou is also a county with a population of more than 300,000, and its natural conditions are similar to those of Lankao. Although the natural appearance has been constantly changing in recent years, it has not changed as quickly or as well as in Lankao. Now it seems that it is not a matter of objective conditions, but rather the lack of ideological revolutionization of our County Party Committee, especially the lack of ambitious aspirations to change the natural appearance. We often emphasize the many difficulties and do not dare to be revolutionary vanguards.
    The County Party Secretary said: "I have been working in Zhongmou for more than ten years, but I have not grasped the situation in this county deeply and thoroughly. Comrade Jiao Yulu, on the other hand, spent only a little over a year in Lankao County. He endured the torment of a serious illness, traveled all over the county, and went to the masses to summarize the experience of controlling the 'three harms,' and quickly promoted it throughout the county. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, I feel that my past work was not arduous or in-depth enough." One Standing Committee member said: "Comrade Jiao Yulu is a man of unyielding integrity. He never bowed his head in the face of difficulties. The more it blew a strong wind or rained heavily, the more he went to sandy areas and waterlogged areas to investigate and research. I also took charge of desert control work for a period of time in the past, but my determination was not great, and I was not as motivated as Comrade Jiao Yulu, who was more enthusiastic and revolutionary the greater the difficulties. By learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit, we must catch up and do a good job in desert control in Zhongmou County."
    How to use Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit to further change the face of Zhongmou County? The Standing Committee members believe that the first is to accelerate the ideological revolutionization of the County Party Committee. Zhongmou County is an old disaster area historically, constantly suffering from the harm of drought, floods, wind, sand, and saline-alkali land. However, as long as we have Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary ambition and the working style of the mass line, and always think of the people, we can change the face of the county faster and better.
    The Standing Committee meeting then discussed the improvement of the leadership of the County Party Committee. They are determined to overcome the past work style of casual observation and superficiality. They must, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, carry forward the spirit of not being afraid of hardship, not being afraid of death, wholeheartedly serving the revolution, and wholeheartedly serving the people. They must go to the masses, go to practice, and squat down at their own work base points to summarize and promote the experience of the masses, using points to lead the whole area, and push the work of changing the face of the entire county to a new stage.

    中牟县委常委同志表示决心
    把焦裕禄革命精神学到手
    把改天换地的斗争抓到底
  新华社郑州九日电　中共河南省中牟县委会的领导干部，怀着革命激情，学习了有关介绍毛主席的好学生焦裕禄事迹的文章和《人民日报》的社论以后，一致表示，一定要让焦裕禄同志的革命精神在中牟县开花结果，一定要象焦裕禄同志那样领导全县人民，为改变中牟面貌而献出自己的一切。
    登载通讯《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》和《人民日报》社论《向毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志学习》的报纸一到县委会，县委立即召开常委会议进行学习。大家都被焦裕禄同志的革命精神所感动。出席会议的常委一致表示：焦裕禄同志确实是我们的好榜样，我们和焦裕禄同志的革命精神相比，差得很远。中牟也是一个三十多万人口的县，自然条件和兰考差不多，近几年来自然面貌虽在不断改变，但不象兰考那样改变得快，改变得好。现在看来，不是客观条件问题，而是我们县委思想上的革命化不够，特别是缺乏改变自然面貌的雄心壮志，往往强调困难多，不敢当革命的闯将。
    县委书记说：“我在中牟已经工作了十几年，但对这个县的情况，还摸得不深不透，而焦裕禄同志到兰考县只有一年多的时间，他忍受着严重疾病的折磨，跑遍了全县，到群众中去总结治理‘三害’的经验，很快在全县推广。对照焦裕禄的事迹，就感到过去自己的工作不艰苦，不深入。”一位常委说：“焦裕禄同志是硬骨头，在困难面前从来不低头，越是刮大风、下大雨的时候，他越是到飞沙地区和积水地区去调查研究。我过去也抓过一段治沙工作，但决心不大，不象焦裕禄同志那样困难越大，革命的干劲越足。学习焦裕禄同志的革命精神，我们就要迎头赶上去，把中牟县的治沙工作搞好。”
    怎样运用焦裕禄同志的革命精神，进一步改变中牟县的面貌呢？县委常委认为，首先是加速县委思想上的革命化。中牟县是历史上遗留下来的老灾区，不断遭受旱、涝、风、沙和盐碱的危害，但是只要有焦裕禄同志那种革命雄心和群众路线的工作作风，时刻想到人民，就可以更快、更好地改变面貌。
    常委会议接着讨论了改进县委领导的问题，他们决心克服过去那种走马观花、飘飘浮浮的工作作风，一定要象焦裕禄同志那样，发扬不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民的精神，到群众中去，到实践中去，到自己的工作基点蹲下去，总结和推广群众的经验，以点带面，把改变全县面貌的工作推向一个新的阶段。
