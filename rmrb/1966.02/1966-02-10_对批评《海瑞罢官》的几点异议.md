   A Few Dissents on the Criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"
   Shi Hanren
   Abstract: The formation of the social effect of literary works is complex, related to the author's creative motives, but not the same thing. One cannot determine this or that motive based on the effect. Academic errors do not necessarily all boil down to reactionary political manifestations. Wu Han can distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and distinguish right from wrong in real political life, but unconsciously commits political errors on academic issues. The current criticism of Wu Han lacks concrete analysis, fails to provide sufficient evidence, and cannot convince people with reason.
    Comrade Wu Han’s article "Self-Criticism on <Hai Rui Dismissed from Office>" is long and contains many miscellaneous points. In summary, its basic spirit is self-defense, containing elements of counter-criticism, while also admitting some errors and making self-criticism. Although these do not occupy a major position in the article, nor are they deeply criticized, the admission of certain errors and the self-criticism are objective facts. To deny this is not a materialistic attitude.
    Comrade Wu Han's self-criticism does not completely agree with others' criticisms of him, which is natural. However, his article is titled "Self-Criticism," but in reality, it uses great effort to defend, exonerate, and clarify himself, making it inconsistent with the name, no wonder some comrades are very angry.
    Recently, many articles criticizing "Self-Criticism on <Hai Rui Dismissed from Office>" have been published in various newspapers. We agree with the well-reasoned parts of these articles; we also have objections to the inadequately reasoned parts. Here are a few opinions for discussion.
    The Issue of Motive and Effect Has Been Oversimplified
    What were the real, specific motives for Comrade Wu Han to study Hai Rui and write articles and plays praising Hai Rui? What was he thinking internally? Some comrades are eager to know this. Although Comrade Wu Han quoted Chairman Mao in his "Self-Criticism" and admitted that his position was problematic, this answer does not seem to satisfy some comrades. They accuse Comrade Wu Han of pretending to be confused, deceiving himself, and insist that he confess his "ulterior motives" and explain how he consciously cooperated with the class enemy's restoration activities at that time. What is the basis for this? Nothing other than first analyzing the ideological content of the work, linking it to the class struggle situation at the time, deriving the objective effect of the work, and then determining that the motive is this or that based on the effect, which is called the theory of the unity of motive and effect.
    Yes, we advocate the theory of the unity of motive and effect. Our view on the relationship between motive and effect is that we should neither emphasize motive and deny effect, nor emphasize effect and deny motive; we must both draw a clear line between ourselves and idealists, and draw a clear line between ourselves and mechanical materialists. We should use the social effect of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" at the time of its performance and publication to test whether Comrade Wu Han's subjective intention was correct, or in other words, whether his heart was good.
    Through analysis of the content of the play, we believe that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" promotes a supra-class view of the state, promotes class reconciliation, and expresses Comrade Wu Han's erroneous moral and historical views, etc. The descriptions of returning land, eliminating bullies, redressing unjust verdicts, and Hai Rui's "unyielding spirit" played a certain role in cooperating with the class enemy's offensive at the time. This allows us to determine that Comrade Wu Han's subjective motive was not good and that there was a problem with his position. In fact, Comrade Wu Han also admitted this point. However, to further pursue the specific content of his subjective intention, it is necessary to take out many facts from Comrade Wu Han's entire social practice and conduct a detailed, rigorous, and concrete examination. It cannot be said that whatever effect there is, the author has this or that motive. The objective effect of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was to cooperate with the class enemy's restoration activities, so Wu Han's motive must be to call on people to "return land" and "redress unjust verdicts" to engage in counter-revolutionary restoration activities. Saying this may seem neat and efficient, unifying motive and effect absolutely, but this kind of "unification" is a metaphysical unification, a reckless approach by mechanical materialists. What good does it do to simplify and absolutize the problem in this way?
    We know that in literature, there is the so-called problem of objective significance being greater than subjective thought. A writer makes a high degree of artistic generalization of the truth of life in his work, and the objective significance of the artistic image he creates is often greater than or exceeds his subjective intention. Marx said that English realist writers such as Dickens "revealed more political and social truths to the world in their excellent and vivid books than all the professional politicians, publicists, and moralists put together" ("The English Bourgeoisie," *Marx and Engels Collected Works*, Volume 10, page 686). This is not to say that Dickens and others were so many times more insightful than the bourgeois scholars of the time and had realized all those political and social truths, but rather that their works possessed a certain degree of authenticity in reproducing real life and achieved greater objective significance, which can be said to be beyond the writer's expectation. Similarly, Cao Xueqin had his own motives and purposes when writing *Dream of the Red Chamber*, but he certainly did not have the subjective intention of expressing the inevitable laws of historical development and revealing the inevitable demise of feudal society because he did not have Marxism as a guide and could not understand this at all. However, a reader today armed with Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought can conclude that one of the ideological significances of *Dream of the Red Chamber* is that it expresses the inevitability of the demise of feudal society. Obviously, we cannot say that because there is this effect, Cao Xueqin must have had this motive. The formation of the social effect of literary works is a result of the interaction of many complex factors, including the ideas that the writer attempts to express, the way in which the ideas are expressed, the historical background and social conditions in which the work is published, and the reader's own experience, etc. It is related to the writer's own creative motives, but it is not the same thing. One cannot determine this or that motive based on the effect, equating motive and effect completely.
    So, does this mean that the true creative motives of Comrade Wu Han are unknowable? No, on the one hand, it depends on Comrade Wu Han himself to examine, and on the other hand, we need to present concrete materials from Comrade Wu Han's entire social practice for analysis, and judge them with reference to the objective effect of his works. It is not possible to draw conclusions based solely on the objective effect of the work, as that would neither convince Comrade Wu Han nor satisfy the readers. In short, for such a major issue that requires special caution, critics should not be too dogmatic.
    Political Issues and Academic Issues Have Been Absolutized
    Is an academic issue a political issue? The answer is yes. Because academics belong to the realm of the superstructure, they reflect the economic base and serve the economic base, and politics is the concentrated reflection of the economy, the embodiment of the interests of a certain class. Academics must be subordinate to the politics of a certain class, and the struggle in the academic field must be a manifestation of class struggle. This is the theoretical basis for analyzing the class essence of academic issues. Comrade Wu Han understands this principle to some extent. He did not think that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was merely an academic issue, but admitted that its objective effect in politics was bad and that it was a political issue.
    The problem is, specifically to each individual, can errors in academic issues all be attributed to the reactionary manifestations of political positions? Comrade Wu Han said that "for more than twenty years, under the education, cultivation, and care of the Party, my political class position has been firmly established. But on the other hand, the class position of my academic thought is still basically the old, old, bourgeois one." The concept that a person can have two diametrically opposed class positions, one in politics and one in academic thought, is unscientific and incomprehensible to people. However, from the full text, the meaning expressed by Comrade Wu Han can be somewhat touched upon, that is, he can distinguish between the enemy and ourselves and distinguish right from wrong in real political life, and unconditionally obey the leadership of the Party, but because his worldview has not been well transformed, there are still many feudal and bourgeois things hidden in the depths of his thoughts, and thus he unconsciously commits political errors on academic issues under specific conditions. It should be said that this is plausible. Although any error in academic issues can ultimately be explained from the social class struggle, academic issues still have their own particularities. A person's serious errors on academic issues may be a manifestation of his reactionary political position, or it may be due to unfamiliarity with Marxism, or to doubts about Marxism, and it is also related to the ideological level of the academic community at the time, and to a certain trend of thought determined by the class struggle situation at the time that was rampant in the entire field of academic research.
    Chairman Mao said in his "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China": "The vast majority of intellectuals, more than 90 percent of the five million total, support the socialist system to varying degrees." He also said:
  "If we look at the five million or so intellectuals in terms of their attitude towards Marxism, it seems that we can say this: about a dozen percent of them, including Communist Party members and non-Party sympathizers, are relatively familiar with Marxism and have stood firm, standing on the proletarian position. ... The majority want to study Marxism, and have also learned a little, but are not yet familiar with it. Some of them still have doubts and have not yet stood firm. They will waver left and right at the slightest sign of trouble.” This means that there are people in real life who have a basic political position of supporting the socialist system and at the same time make mistakes on academic issues due to unfamiliarity with or doubts about Marxism. Some people say: "What class position a person stands on in politics, he will make expressions in academics that are consistent with his political position." This statement is generally correct. Denying this is denying that academic issues are ultimately political issues. However, the issue cannot be absolutized, thinking that a person's errors in academics must be a manifestation of his reactionary political position. If this logic is extrapolated, it will inevitably lead to some people who are not reactionary in their political positions being pushed to the enemy's side in real life, which is detrimental to our cause.
    Although some comrades also agree that the issue cannot be absolutized, agreeing that there are indeed some people in life who make this or that kind of academic error that is only an academic issue, they assert that Wu Han is an exception, saying that he is dissatisfied with the Party and socialism, and uses academics as a protective color to attack the Party and socialism. What real evidence is sufficient to make this statement stand? Are the statements and activities of Wu Han's academic issues in the past few years enough to make people fully believe this statement? Political struggle is a very serious matter. To judge whether a person's political position is reactionary, it is necessary to proceed from the specific materials of his entire social practice, especially to examine his basic attitude towards the Party's leadership, the Party's various policies, and specific revolutionary work, and not to rashly conclude based on one aspect of the situation. In fact, this simplistic approach has already created a certain stalemate, that is, on the one hand, some comrades firmly believe that Wu Han is very aware of the reactionary nature of what he has done in the past few years, and his political position is completely reactionary, and on the other hand, Wu Han cannot be persuaded and insists that he is unconscious and his political position is firm. Isn't this situation worth our serious consideration?
    On this issue, we agree with Yao Wenyuan's analysis: "Class struggle is an objective existence, and it must be reflected in the ideological field in this or that form, reflected in the pen of this or that writer, regardless of whether the writer is conscious or unconscious. This is an objective law that does not depend on people's will" ("Commentary on the Newly Compiled Historical Drama <Hai Rui Dismissed from Office>"). This conclusion is scientific because it does not rule out the possibility that a person whose worldview has not been well transformed may unconsciously become a conscript of the class enemy under certain social conditions, nor does it rule out the possibility that a class enemy standing on a reactionary position may take the opportunity to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration activities; it neither rules out the inevitability that class struggle is reflected in the ideological field in this or that form, nor does it rule out the contingency that it is reflected in the pen of this or that writer whose thoughts have not been transformed well. It emphasizes the objective law of class struggle that does not depend on people's will, which no one can deny. Through criticizing the erroneous academic ideas promoted by Comrade Wu Han in the past few years, we should be prompted to further analyze and study how class struggle is reflected in the ideological field, expose the class essence of various anti-Marxist trends of thought, and thus draw profound and rich historical experiences and lessons from them, enhance the viewpoint of class and class struggle, and resolutely defend the proletarian ideological front. We believe that this is our most important combat task. As for whether Comrade Wu Han is conscious or unconscious, whether he "really does not understand" or "pretends not to understand," it does not seem necessary to rush to draw a conclusion for him.
      Criticism of Wu Han Fails to Provide Sufficient Evidence
    We believe that we should welcome Comrade Wu Han's publication of articles, admitting certain errors, and putting forward opinions. If Comrade Wu Han continues to adhere to his past opinions, as long as he gives reasons, we should study them in depth. If he puts forward new opinions, we should also seriously consider them. It should be said that Comrade Wu Han's publication of articles is beneficial to the in-depth development of the discussion.
    Now some comrades often say that his "self-criticism" is a new attack and a new challenge to Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought, but they cannot provide sufficient evidence. This does not help the discussion. We believe that this discussion has only just begun, and it is too early to draw conclusions. Who is right and who is wrong has a general idea, but many specific issues, such as the issue of incorruptible officials, the issue of evaluating historical figures, and the issue of historical dramas, etc., have not yet been fully clarified, and there is no consensus in the academic community. Many of the views put forward by Comrade Wu Han in his "self-criticism" are worthy of our discussion. Some people say that he has also promoted the theory of the unity of interests of medium and small landlords and peasants, the theory of the unity of long-term interests of the ruling class and the current interests of the ruled class, and the theory that Hai Rui's "return of land" brought benefits to some peasants. In short, he promoted the theory of class reconciliation. Can the problem really be summarized in this way? No. In his book *Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy*, Engels criticized Feuerbach for "breaking Hegel's system and simply abandoning it," saying: "Declaring this philosophy to be wrong is not the same as conquering this philosophy." Here, we do not intend to make any comparisons, but we hope that our critics can attach importance to giving Marxist scientific explanations to many complex social and historical phenomena, and truly achieve convincing people with reason, not suppressing them.
    In addition, the criticism of Comrade Wu Han's article should also be based on facts. Wrong opinions should be criticized, and correct views should also be affirmed. The original text of Comrade Wu Han must be quoted accurately. Some comrades have not paid enough attention to this aspect, quoting out of context, forcing things to fit, and in order to illustrate their own point of view, disregarding the author's original intention, arbitrarily dismembering and piecing together, which at first glance seems plausible, but in reality cannot withstand verification and scrutiny. This cannot truly solve the problem. The citation of historical materials, in particular, must be done with a scientific attitude. It has already been pointed out that some comrades cite the part of the same material that fits their own point of view and obliterate the part that does not fit their own point of view. This technique is also disdained by Marxists.
    We believe that this great debate in the ideological field surrounding the issue of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a struggle between two worldviews, a reflection of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in the ideological field, a serious class struggle, and this struggle is mainly conducted in the form of academic debate, so it requires us to have both high revolutionary enthusiasm and a rigorous scientific attitude. In this regard, the founders of scientific communism, Marx and Engels, are our role models. Marx said in the preface to the first edition of his famous work *Capital*, Volume I: "Every judgment that is based on scientific criticism is welcome to me." He always carefully considered the opinions of his opponents and then gave a rebuttal with sufficient arguments, rigorous logic, and great fighting power. We should learn well this scientific spirit and scientific attitude. Only in this way can we not only counter the various anti-Marxist-Leninist trends of thought that were once rampant in this great debate, but also solve many problems that have not been correctly solved for many years through the clash of different opinions, thereby developing and enriching Marxism-Leninism, universally improving the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought level of academic research, and creating a new situation of academic and cultural great prosperity, great flourishing, and great improvement commensurate with the soaring situation of the national economy during my country's Third Five-Year Plan period. To this end, a certain tendency towards simplification in the current criticism of Comrade Wu Han must be overcome and prevented.

   对批评《海瑞罢官》的几点异议
   时汉人
   提要　文学作品的社会效果的形成是复杂的，同作者的创作动机有联系，但不是一回事，不能据效果而定这个或那个动机。学术上的错误不一定都归结为政治上的反动表现。吴晗在现实的政治生活中能够分清敌我，辩别是非，只是不自觉地在学术问题上犯了政治性的错误。现在对吴晗的批评缺乏具体分析，拿不出充足的证据，不能以理服人。
    吴晗同志《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》一文，文字很长，内容很杂，概括言之，它的基本精神是自我辩护，包含有反批评的成分，同时也承认了某些错误，作了自我批评，尽管这些在文章中不占主要地位，也没有作深入的批判，但承认了某些错误，作了自我批评，是客观事实。不承认这一点，就不是唯物主义的态度。
    吴晗同志的自我批评，不完全同意别人对他的批评，这本来是很自然的事。但他的文章题为“自我批评”，实则以很大的力量作自我辩解、洗白和澄清，名不副实，文不对题，无怪乎有些同志很气愤了。
    最近，各报发表了不少对《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》的批评文章。这些文章中理由充足的部分，我们是同意的；理由不足的地方，我也有异议。这里谈几点意见和大家讨论。
    动机和效果问题被弄得简单化了
    吴晗同志研究海瑞，写歌颂海瑞的文章、剧本，其真实的、具体的动机何在？他内心是如何想的？有些同志很急于要知道这一点。吴晗同志在“自我批评”里虽然引述毛主席的话承认自己立场是有问题的，看来这个回答不能满足有些同志的要求。他们指责吴晗同志假装糊涂，自欺欺人，一定要他招认出“不可告人的目的”，交代当时是如何自觉地配合阶级敌人复辟活动的。究竟根据什么呢？无它，先从作品思想内容分析，联系彼时阶级斗争形势，引出作品客观效果，然后据效果而定动机是这个或那个，是谓动机和效果统一论。
    是的，我们是主张动机和效果统一论的。我们对于动机和效果二者的关系的看法，既不要强调动机否认效果，也不要强调效果否认动机；既要同唯心论者划清界限，又要同机械唯物论者划清界限。我们应该用《海瑞罢官》在演出、发表的当时产生的社会效果，去检验吴晗同志的主观意图是否正确，或者说，他的心是否好。
    通过对剧本内容的分析，我们认为《海瑞罢官》宣扬了超阶级的国家观，宣扬了阶级调和论，表现了吴晗同志错误的道德观、历史观等等，对退田、除霸、平冤狱和海瑞的“傲骨”的描写，在当时起了某种程度的配合阶级敌人进攻的作用。这就可以断定吴晗同志的主观动机是不好的，是有立场问题的。事实上，吴晗同志也承认了这一点。但是，往下再追问他的主观意图的具体内容是什么？这就需要从吴晗同志的全部社会实践中拿出许多事实，进行周详的、严密的、具体的考察。不能说，有什么效果就是作者有这个或那个动机，《海瑞罢官》的客观效果是配合了阶级敌人的复辟活动，吴晗的动机就一定是号召人们“退田”、“平冤狱”，搞反革命复辟活动。这样说，看起来倒也干净利落，方便省事，动机和效果绝对地统一起来了，但这样搞“统一”是形而上学的统一，是机械唯物论者轻率的作法。把问题弄得如此简单化、绝对化，有什么好处呢？
    我们知道，在文学上有所谓客观意义大于主观思想的问题。一个作家在他的作品中对生活真实进行了高度的艺术概括，他创造的艺术形象的客观意义往往大于或超过他的主观意图。马克思说英国现实主义作家狄更斯等“在自己的卓越的描写生动的书籍中向世界揭示的政治和社会真理，比一切职业政客、政论家和道德家加在一起所揭示的还要多”（《英国资产阶级》，《马克思恩格斯全集》第十卷，第六八六页）。这不是说狄更斯等如何比当时的资产阶级学者高明多少倍，对那些政治和社会真理都认识到了，而是说他们的作品在再现现实生活时具有某种程度的真实性，获得了较大的客观意义，可以说是非作家意料之所及的。同样，曹雪芹写《红楼梦》时有他自己的动机和目的，但他决没有表现历史发展的必然规律和揭露封建社会必然灭亡的命运的主观意图，因为他没有马克思主义作指导，根本认识不到这一点。但是，一个今天的用马克思主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的读者能从中得出结论，认为《红楼梦》的思想意义里有一条是表现了封建社会灭亡的必然性的。很显然，我们不能说有这个效果，曹雪芹就一定有这个动机。文学作品的社会效果的形成是有很复杂的因素的，它是作家力图表达的思想、用以表达思想的方式、作品发表的时代背景、社会条件以及读者自己的体验等等多方面因素互相作用的结果，同作家本人的创作动机有联系，但不是一回事，不能据效果而定这个或那个动机，把动机和效果完全等同起来。
    那么这样说，对吴晗同志的真正创作动机是否就不可知了呢？不，一方面固然要有待于吴晗同志自己去检查，另一方面也需要我们摆出吴晗同志全部社会实践中的具体材料进行分析，参照其作品的客观效果加以判断。不能单凭作品的客观效果下结论，那是既说服不了吴晗同志，也无法使读者心悦诚服的。总之，对这样关系重大而特别需要慎重的问题，批评者是不宜太武断的。
    把政治问题和学术问题绝对化了
    学术问题是不是政治问题？回答是肯定的。因为学术属于上层建筑的范畴，它反映经济基础并为经济基础服务，而政治又是经济的集中反映，是一定阶级利益的体现，学术必然要从属于一定阶级的政治，学术领域内的斗争必然是阶级斗争的表现。这是分析学术问题的阶级实质的理论根据。这个道理吴晗同志是有些懂的，他没有认为《海瑞罢官》只是学术问题，而承认它在政治上客观效果是恶劣的，是一个政治性问题。
    问题在于，具体到每一个人，学术问题上错误是否都可以归结为政治立场的反动的表现？吴晗同志说他“二十多年来一直在党的教育、培养、关怀下，政治上的阶级立场是站稳了的。但在另一面，学术思想上的阶级立场，却还基本上是旧的、老的、资产阶级的”。一个人可以有截然对立的政治上的和学术思想的两种阶级立场，这种概念是不科学的，也是人们不能理解的。但从全文看，吴晗同志所表达的意思多少可以触及，即是他在现实政治生活中能够分清敌我，辨别是非，无条件地服从党的领导，但由于世界观没有得到很好改造，思想深处还蕴藏着不少的封建的、资产阶级的东西，因而在特定条件下不自觉地在学术问题上犯了政治性的错误。应该说，这是可以说得通的。虽然任何学术问题的错误最终都可以从社会的阶级斗争中找到解释，但学术问题还是有它的特殊性的。一个人学术问题上的严重错误，可能是其反动的政治立场的表现，也可能是对马克思主义不熟悉，或者对马克思主义还有怀疑所致，而且与当时学术界的思想水平，与由当时阶级斗争形势决定的泛滥于整个学术研究领域的某种思潮都有关系。
    毛主席在《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》里说：“绝大部分的知识分子，占五百万总数的百分之九十以上的人，都是在各种不同的程度上拥护社会主义制度的。”又说：
  “五百万左右的知识分子，如果拿他们对待马克思主义的态度来看，似乎可以这样说：大约有百分之十几的人，包括共产党员和党外同情分子，是比较熟悉马克思主义，并且站稳了脚跟，站稳了无产阶级立场的。……多数人想学习马克思主义，并且也学了一点，但是还不熟悉。其中有些人还有怀疑，还没有站稳脚跟，一遇风浪就会左右摇摆。”这就是说，现实生活中具有拥护社会主义制度的基本政治立场同时由于不熟悉或怀疑马克思主义而在学术问题上犯错误的人是存在的。有人说：“一个人在政治上站在什么阶级立场，在学术上便会作出与他的政治立场相适应的表现。”这个说法一般说是正确的，否认这一点，就是不承认学术问题归根到底是政治问题。但不能把问题绝对化，以为一个人的学术上的错误一定是其政治立场反动的表现。按这个逻辑推演下去，在现实生活中势必要把一些不是政治立场反动的人打到敌人那一边去，这对我们的事业是不利的。
    有的同志虽然也同意不能把问题绝对化，同意生活中确有一些人犯这样或那样的学术上的错误，只是学术问题，但是断言吴晗同志是一个例外，说他对党对社会主义心怀不满，以学术作为保护色，向党向社会主义进攻。足以使这种说法成立的真实凭据究竟有多少呢？光是吴晗同志前几年学术问题的一些言论和活动就能够使人完全相信这种说法吗？政治斗争是十分严肃的事，判断一个人的政治立场是否反动，需要从他的全部社会实践的具体材料出发，特别是要考察他对党的领导、党的各项方针政策、具体的革命工作的基本态度如何，不能轻率地根据某一方面情况下结论。实际上，这种简单化的作法已经造成某种僵持局面，即一方面某些同志一口咬定吴晗同志对自己过去几年中所作所为的反动性很自觉，其政治立场是完全反动的，另一方面吴晗同志也不能被说服，坚持认为自己是不自觉的，政治立场是站稳了的，这种情况难道还不值得我们认真考虑一下吗？
    对这个问题，我们同意姚文元同志的这一分析：“阶级斗争是客观存在，它必然要在意识形态领域内用这种或者那种形式反映出来，在这位或者那位作家的笔下反映出来，而不管这位作家是自觉的还是不自觉的，这是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。”（《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》）这个论断之所以是科学的，是因为它并不排除一个世界观没有很好改造的人在某种社会条件下不自觉地当了阶级敌人的义务兵的可能性，也不排除一个站在反动立场上的阶级敌人乘机进行反革命复辟活动的可能性；既不排除阶级斗争在意识形态领域内以这种或那种形式反映出来的必然性，也不排除在这个或那个思想没有改造好的作家笔下反映出来的偶然性。它强调的是阶级斗争的不以人们意志为转移的客观规律，这是任何人都不能否认的。通过对吴晗同志过去几年中宣传的错误的学术思想批判，应该促使我们进一步分析、研究阶级斗争在意识形态领域中是如何反映的，揭露各种反马克思主义思潮的阶级实质，因而从中汲取深刻的、丰富的历史经验和教训，增强阶级和阶级斗争的观点，坚决捍卫无产阶级思想阵地。我们认为，这才是我们头等重要的战斗任务，至于吴晗同志是自觉还是不自觉，是“真的不懂得”还是“假装不懂得”，似乎不必急于替他作结论。
      对吴晗的批评拿不出充足证据
    我们认为，对于吴晗同志发表文章，承认某些错误，提出看法，应该抱欢迎的态度。吴晗同志如果继续坚持他过去的意见，只要讲出理由，就应该深入研究，如果他提出了新的看法，也应该认真予以考虑。应该说，吴晗同志发表文章对讨论的深入开展是有好处的。
    现在有些同志动辄就说他的“自我批评”是对马克思主义、毛泽东思想的新进攻、新挑战，又拿不出很充足的证据来，这是无助于讨论的。我们认为，这个讨论还只是刚刚揭开序幕，离作结论还太早，谁是谁非大致上有个眉目了，但是涉及许多具体问题，如清官问题、历史人物评价问题、历史剧问题等等，还远没有完全弄清楚，也没有在学术界取得一致的看法。吴晗同志在他的“自我批评”里提出的不少看法是值得我们讨论的。有人说，他又宣扬了中、小地主和农民利益一致论，宣扬了统治阶级长远利益和被统治阶级当前利益一致论，宣扬了海瑞的“退田”给部分农民带来了好处，一言以蔽之曰：宣扬了阶级调和论。问题果真能作这样的概括吗？不能。恩格斯在《费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结》一书中批评费尔巴哈“打破了黑格尔的体系，干脆把它抛弃了”，他说：“宣布这个哲学是错误的，还不等于制服了这一哲学。”这里，我们无意于作什么比拟，只是希望我们的批评者能重视对许多复杂的社会历史现象予以马克思主义的科学的解释，真正作到以理服人，不能压服。
    另外，对吴晗同志的文章的批评也要实事求是，错误的意见应该批评，正确的看法也要肯定。引用吴晗同志的原文，必须力求准确。有的同志在这方面注意得还不是很够的，断章取义，削足适履，为了说明自己的观点，不顾作者的原意，随心所欲地加以肢解、硬凑，乍看起来，振振有词，实际上经不起对证和推敲，这样是不能真正解决问题的。引证史料，尤其要有科学态度。已经有人指出某些同志引证同一资料里合乎自己论点的部分，抹杀掉不合自己论点的部分，这种手法也是为马克思主义者所不齿的。
    我们认为，意识形态领域内围绕《海瑞罢官》问题展开的这一场大辩论，是两种世界观的斗争，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争在思想界的反映，是一场严重的阶级斗争，而这一场斗争主要是以学术辩论的形式进行的，因此它要求我们既有高度的革命热情，又有严谨的科学态度。在这方面，科学共产主义创始人马克思、恩格斯是我们的表率。马克思在他的名著《资本论》第一卷初版序中说：“每一种以科学批判为根据的判断，都是我欢迎的。”他对论敌的意见，总是认真考虑，然后以充足的论据、严密的逻辑和极大的战斗力给予回击。我们应该好好地学习这种科学精神、科学态度。只有这样，才能在这场大辩论中不仅反击喧嚣一时的各种反马克思列宁主义思潮，而且通过不同意见的交锋，解决多年来没有正确解决的许多问题，从而发展、丰富马克思列宁主义，普遍提高学术研究的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想水平，造成一个同我国第三个五年计划期间国民经济的高涨形势相称的学术文化大繁荣、大兴盛、大提高的新局面。为此，当前对于吴晗同志的批评中的某种简单化倾向，不能不加以克服和防止。
