    Our country's rural sideline resources are rich and diverse.
    Our country has a vast territory, spanning the frigid, temperate, and tropical zones, with exceptionally abundant products. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than two thousand kinds of edible plants, more than two hundred kinds of aromatic plants, more than five thousand kinds of trees, more than two thousand eight hundred kinds of medicinal plants and animals, more than one thousand kinds of birds, more than six hundred kinds of beasts, more than three hundred kinds of amphibians and reptiles, more than two thousand kinds of fish, and more than two hundred kinds of algae. All of these provide abundant resources for the development of rural sideline production.
    Among China's wild animals, many are rare or unique species not found in other countries in the world. They are: giant pandas, golden monkeys, red-crowned cranes, etc.
    Wild animals in China are widely distributed. Except for cities, wild animals are found in almost 80 percent of the country's area. In twenty counties in northern Heilongjiang, calculated by average density, there are ten to eleven muskrats per hectare of land. The furs of wild animals are all rural sideline products, valuable ones including: otter pelts, weasel pelts, "sweep-snow" pelts, mink pelts, fox pelts, and so on.
    China's wild plants also have huge potential for utilization. At present, the collection of acorns accounts for only five per thousand of the harvestable amount. If the country can purchase 100 million jin of acorns each year, it can brew 33 million jin of 65-proof liquor, saving 80 million jin of grain, and increasing the income of farmers in the producing areas by 10 million yuan.
    Silvergrass is a wild raw material for papermaking, and it is found everywhere in southern China. According to surveys in the four provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, the existing silvergrass resources are equivalent to three times the national output of reed for papermaking. Two and a half tons of silvergrass can produce one ton of cultural paper. If 50 percent of the existing silvergrass resources can be utilized, 400,000 tons of cultural paper can be produced, which can increase farmers' income by 27.5 million yuan.
    From 1955 to 1964, according to incomplete statistics, various regions purchased a total of 790,000 tons of rags, 560,000 tons of old shoes, 150,000 tons of waste hemp, and 2 million tons of waste paper as raw materials for papermaking. This can produce 1.5 million tons of paper, saving 9.51 million cubic meters of wood. It seems that the recycling of waste materials is also very promising.

    我国农村副业资源丰富多采
    我国幅员广大，地跨寒带、温带、热带，物产异常丰富。据不完全统计，全国各地可供食用的植物达两千多种；香料植物二百多种；树木五千多种；药用植物和动物两千八百多种；鸟类一千多种；兽类六百多种；两栖和爬行类三百多种；鱼类两千多种；海藻类二百多种。所有这些，都为发展农村副业生产提供了丰足的资源。
    我国的野生动物中，有许多是世界上别的国家所没有或稀有的珍品。它们是：大熊猫、金丝猴、丹顶鹤等。
    我国野生动物分布很广。除城市外，几乎占全国面积百分之八十的地区都有野生动物。黑龙江北部二十个县，按平均密度计算，每公顷土地就有麝鼠十到十一只。野生动物的皮毛都是农村副业产品，贵重的有：水獭皮、黄鼠狼皮、扫雪皮、貂皮、狐狸皮等等。
    我国的野生植物也有巨大的利用潜力。目前，橡子的采集量仅占可采量的千分之五。如果每年全国能收购一亿斤橡子，就可以酿六十五度酒三千三百万斤，节约粮食八千万斤，为产区农民增加收入一千万元。
    芒杆，是一种野生造纸原料，在我国南方到处都有。据浙江、广东、广西、福建四个省区的调查，现有芒杆资源相当于全国造纸苇草产量的三倍。两吨半芒杆，可以生产一吨文化纸。如果能利用现有芒杆资源的百分之五十，可产文化纸四十万吨，可为农民增加收入两千七百五十万元。
    一九五五年到一九六四年不完全统计，各地共收购作为造纸原料的破布七十九万吨，旧鞋五十六万吨，废麻十五万吨，废纸二百万吨。可造纸一百五十万吨，可节约木材九百五十一万立方米。看来，废旧物资的回收，也大有可为。
