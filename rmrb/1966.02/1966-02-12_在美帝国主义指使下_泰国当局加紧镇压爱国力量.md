    Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism,
    Thai Authorities Intensify Suppression of Patriotic Forces
    Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Bangkok: The Thanom Thanarakit traitorous clique of Thailand, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, has recently intensified its suppression of patriotic forces in Thailand.
    According to Thai newspapers, the Thanom group in Thailand has not only dispatched large numbers of military police and aircraft to conduct "encirclement and suppression" operations recently, but has also established a so-called "Special Command Headquarters for Communist Suppression" jointly composed of the military and police, responsible for directing the suppression of patriotic forces. It has also imitated the brutal methods of the United States in South Vietnam in establishing "strategic hamlets," establishing disguised concentration camps in so-called "dangerous areas," and detaining patriotic people on a large scale. It has decided to station a team of "Homeland Defense Volunteers" in each of the thirty-seven provinces on the border and to establish "intelligence teams" in twenty-four border areas to strengthen reactionary rule.
  The Thai authorities have already taken measures to strictly control radio stations. On January 31, a fascist-style exercise to suppress the patriotic activities of the Thai people was held in Bangkok. During the exercise, Thai police drove fire trucks into the crowd, then used water cannons filled with colored dye to spray "riotous" crowds, staining their bodies with color to facilitate police arrest.
    The Thanom group's crimes of selling Thailand to U.S. imperialism as a base for expanding the war of aggression in Indochina, and of intensifying bloody suppression of patriotic forces in Thailand, are being met with strong resistance from Thai patriotic forces.

    在美帝国主义指使下
    泰国当局加紧镇压爱国力量
    新华社十日讯　曼谷消息：泰国他侬卖国集团在美帝国主义的指使下，最近加紧镇压泰国爱国力量。
    据泰国报纸报道，最近泰国他侬集团除了出动大批军警并在飞机配合下进行“围剿”外，还建立了一个由军队和警察联合组成的所谓“剿共特别指挥部”，负责指挥镇压爱国力量。它还仿效美国在南越建立“战略村”的残暴办法，在所谓“危险地区”建立变相的集中营，大规模地拘禁爱国人民。它决定在边境三十七个府的每一个府驻扎一队“保卫国土志愿队”和在二十四个边区增设“情报队”来加强反动统治。
  泰国当局已经采取措施严密控制电台。一月三十一日在曼谷举行了一次法西斯式的镇压泰国人民爱国活动的演习。在演习中，泰国警察把消防车驶进人群，然后把灌有色料的水龙头向“暴动”群众扫射，使他们身上着色，便于警察逮捕。
    他侬集团把泰国出卖给美帝国主义作为扩大印度支那的战争侵略基地；以及对泰国爱国力量加紧进行血腥镇压的罪行，正在遭到泰国爱国力量的强烈反抗。
