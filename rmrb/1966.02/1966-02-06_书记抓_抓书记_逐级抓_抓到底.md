    The Shandong Provincial Party Committee believes that to study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, it is necessary to have a thorough spirit of self-revolution, first use Chairman Mao's teachings to transform one's own subjective world; it is necessary to combine study with work and struggle, and bring all work under the "key link" of Mao Zedong Thought.

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) In the past year or two, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee has preliminarily implemented the leadership method of secretaries grasping, grasping secretaries, level-by-level grasping, level-by-level leading, level-by-level helping, layer-by-layer grasping, step-by-step grasping, and grasping to the end, vigorously grasping the study of Chairman Mao's works by cadres above the county level, further promoting the ideological revolutionization of cadres and the development of various tasks.

    Leadership Grasps, Grasp Leadership

    In order to implement this learning method of leadership grasping, grasping leadership, and grasping to the end, central study groups for studying Chairman Mao's works have been established from the provincial party committee and directly subordinate departments to the local (municipal) party committees and county party committees. The First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee serves as the leader of the Provincial Party Committee's central study group, directly grasping the study of members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the main responsible persons of the various departments and commissions of the Provincial Party Committee. The secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, according to their division of labor, directly grasp the study of the party group secretaries of various departments and bureaus. In addition to adhering to self-study, the central study group of the Provincial Party Committee also puts forward some more important issues to guide the study of the vast number of cadres, based on the focus of work during a certain period and in combination with the actual thinking of the cadres.

    Grasp cadres, lead the masses; grasp the masses, promote cadres, is another method of Shandong Provincial Party Committee's leadership study. Last year, the Provincial Party Committee selected a group of advanced figures in studying Chairman Mao's works from the workers and peasants of the province and sent them to various places to make reports. The leading cadres of various departments and regions were greatly shaken after listening to the reports, and generally believed that this was a challenge to the leading cadres by the workers, peasants, and grassroots cadres, expressing their determination to catch up.

    Since the spring of last year, the leading organs at the provincial, municipal, and county levels in Shandong Province have also held short-term off-the-job self-study classes for cadres, organizing leaders at all levels to concentrate for a certain period of time to devote themselves to studying Chairman Mao's works.

    The provincial, municipal, and county party committees have established a learning system, insisting on studying for two and a half days every week.

    Learn in Use, Use in Learning

    In the process of studying Chairman Mao's works, cadres above the county level pay attention to making efforts in the word "use." When implementing the central government's guidelines, policies, and instructions, many comrades study them in light of Chairman Mao's relevant works to deepen their understanding of the essence of the central government's guidelines, policies, and instructions. When implementing the central government's guidelines, policies, and instructions to lower-level units, in addition to conducting investigation and research and clarifying the actual situation in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, they try to find the most fundamental basis from Chairman Mao's works. General meetings of cadres and professional work meetings convened by the party and government leading organs at the provincial, municipal, and county levels generally start with theoretical discussions to implement work tasks, that is, "first listen to Chairman Mao's instructions, and then do as Chairman Mao said." This approach works very well.

    The Shandong Provincial Party Committee also organizes cadres to visit advanced models and creatively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. The provincial, municipal, and county party committees have planned and organized some cadres to visit Dazhai-style agricultural models such as Linqi Prefecture, Xiadingjia Brigade, and Dongguo Brigade. After seeing these living examples of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, many comrades felt that every word of Chairman Mao was heavier than Mount Tai when they turned around and read "On Practice," "On Contradiction," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The comrades of some prefectural and county committees have particularly deep experiences. They said that in the past, when visiting, they looked at the good crops in the fields and asked how much seed and fertilizer was used, seeing things but not people, and failing to grasp the essence of the problem. Now, having mastered the weapon of observing and solving problems from Chairman Mao's works, they learned the Mao Zedong Thought of "poverty leads to change, we must work, we must make revolution" through good mountains and good water during the visit, and enhanced their confidence in transforming nature.

    Encouraging Results Achieved

    Cadres above the county level in Shandong Province have achieved encouraging results in studying Chairman Mao's works. First of all, the truth that class struggle is the key link for all work has begun to be recognized and grasped by some comrades. When reviewing their thoughts in their studies, some comrades said, "In the past, they admitted the existence of class struggle and the two-road struggle in words, but it was not implemented in their hearts," and "they were blindly engaged in production, which was not easy and did not have good results." Now, after listening to Chairman Mao's words and grasping the key link of class struggle and the two-road struggle, all tasks have been changed. The changes are particularly obvious in Qufu, Qihe, Haiyang and other counties that have undergone the socialist education movement, and many problems left over from history have been solved in just one year, and a good harvest was obtained in 1965.

    Secondly, many cadres have less metaphysical things in their thinking than in the past, and they pay attention to learning and applying the one-divides-into-two viewpoint to observe and deal with problems. For example, some comrades in Caoxian originally believed that the county had a large population, many alkaline depressions, serious disasters, and poor conditions, and they lacked confidence in transforming nature. However, after conducting a specific analysis using the one-divides-into-two viewpoint, they realized that the large population also meant there were more people to work, and the power to transform nature was greater; although the yield of alkaline depressions was low, the potential for increasing production was also greater. If the alkaline depressions are transformed well, production will develop significantly. After the efforts of last winter and spring, the county's production landscape has undergone great changes.

    Third, the atmosphere of going deep into reality, going deep among the masses, seeking truth from facts, and conducting investigation and research has begun to take shape. Many comrades follow Chairman Mao's instructions, go deep into the front lines of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation to conduct investigation and research and summarize experiences. In places where this has been done, new scenes of "five more and five less" have emerged. The five more are: more first-hand materials on understanding the situation below, more experience in grassroots work and mass work, more contact with cadres, activists, and the masses, more dialectical views of problems, and more personal actions and brains. The five less are: less unrealistic empty talk, less detachment from the masses, less metaphysics, less arrogance and complacency, and fewer minor physical problems.

    Fourth, Chairman Mao's teaching of "making long-term plans" and "every place must calculate many years into the future from the year it starts working" has become the practical action of many cadres. Many counties, proceeding from the actual situation in their localities, have formulated plans for socialist construction in their regions and are steadily implementing them.

    Fifth, pay attention to grasping the main contradictions and concentrating forces to fight annihilation battles. Many comrades realize that in order to make their work more effective, they must learn to grasp the main contradictions. Responsible comrades of some county party committees reviewed that the reason why agricultural production in their localities did not develop rapidly was mainly because they did not accurately grasp the main contradictions in developing agricultural production, and they fought drought when there was drought year after year, fought flood when there was flood, repaired and patched up, urged plowing and planting, and as a result, the natural conditions could not be fundamentally changed. Now, they are beginning to change this passive situation and are paying more attention to concentrating forces to solve key problems.

    Everything Must Go "Online" (be guided by Mao's Thought)

    Recently, the Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee held a special meeting to study this year's cadre study plan. The Provincial Party Committee believes that the study of Chairman Mao's works by cadres above the county level in Shandong Province is only the beginning, and many units and individuals have not studied well enough, and the efforts made in the word "use" are still poor.

    The meeting decided that this year, in addition to actively organizing cadres to study Chairman Mao's four philosophical works well, vigorously establishing materialist dialectics, and vigorously breaking metaphysics and sophistry, the focus should be on studying Chairman Mao's theory of classes and class struggle, so that the vast number of cadres can firmly establish the idea of ​​being prepared for war and firmly establish the class struggle viewpoint. In short, it is necessary to firmly grasp the key link of class struggle on the political, economic, and ideological fronts, and firmly grasp the key link of the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads.

    The Provincial Party Committee believes that in order to study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, it is necessary to study carefully; it is necessary to have a thorough spirit of self-revolution and first use Chairman Mao's teachings to transform one's own subjective world; it is necessary to combine study with work and struggle and truly take Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology for all work and bring all work under the "key link" of Mao Zedong Thought.

    书记抓  抓书记  逐级抓  抓到底
    山东省委认为，要学好用好毛主席著作，必须有彻底的自我革命的精神，首先把毛主席的教导用来改造自己的主观世界；必须结合工作和斗争去学习，把一切工作都归到毛泽东思想这个“纲”上来。
    本报讯　近一两年来，中共山东省委初步实行了书记抓，抓书记，一级抓一级，一级带一级，一级帮一级，层层抓，逐级抓，一抓到底的领导学习的方法，大抓县以上干部学习毛主席著作，进一步促进了干部思想革命化和各项工作的发展。
    领导抓，抓领导
    为了实行这种领导抓、抓领导、一抓到底的学习方法，从省委、省直属各厅局到各地（市）委、县委，都建立了学习毛主席著作的中心学习组。省委第一书记担任省委中心学习组组长，直接抓省委常委和省委各部委主要负责人的学习。省委书记处书记，按照分工，直接抓各厅局党组书记的学习。省委中心学习组除坚持自学外，还根据一定时期的工作重心，结合干部的思想实际，提出一些比较重要的问题，辅导广大干部的学习。
    抓干部，带群众；抓群众，促干部，是山东省委领导学习的另一个方法。去年省委从全省工农群众中挑选了一批学习毛主席著作的先进人物，巡回全省各地作报告。各部门和各地的领导干部听了报告，震动很大，普遍认为：这是工农群众和基层干部向领导干部挑战，表示决心要赶上去。
    去年春季以来，山东省、地（市）、县各级领导机关还举办了干部短期离职自修班，组织各级领导干部集中一定的时间专心学习毛主席著作。
    省委、地（市）委、县委三级都建立了学习制度，坚持每周学习两个半天。
    学中用，用中学
    县以上干部在学习毛主席著作的过程中，注意在“用”字上下功夫。许多同志在贯彻执行中央的方针政策和指示的时候，对照毛主席有关著作进行研究，加深了解中央的方针政策和指示的精神实质。在向下级单位贯彻中央的方针政策和指示的时候，除了按照毛主席的指示进行调查研究、弄清实际情况以外，尽量从毛主席著作中找到最根本的依据。省、地（市）、县三级党政领导机关召集的各级干部会议和专业性的工作会议，一般从务虚入手，落实工作任务，也就是“先听听毛主席的指示，再照着毛主席说的去办”。这样做，效果很好。
    山东省委还组织干部参观先进典型，活学活用毛泽东思想。省、地（市）、县委有计划地组织了部分干部，分别参观了临沂专区、下丁家大队和东郭大队等大寨式农业典型。许多同志看了这些活学活用毛主席著作的活样板，回过头来再读《实践论》、《矛盾论》和《愚公移山》等文章，更觉得毛主席的每句话比泰山还重。特别是一些地委和县委的同志体会更深。他们说，以前参观，眼看的是地上的好庄稼，嘴问的是用了多少种子、肥料，见物不见人，抓不住本质问题。现在，从毛主席的著作中掌握了观察问题、解决问题的武器，在参观中透过好山好水学到了“穷则思变，要干，要革命”的毛泽东思想，增强了改造自然的信心。
    有了可喜的成果
    山东省县以上干部学习毛主席著作已取得可喜的成果。首先，阶级斗争是一切工作的纲这一真理，开始被一些同志认识和掌握。一些同志在学习中检查思想的时候说，“过去口头上承认存在着阶级斗争、两条道路斗争，心里头没有落实”，“蒙着头抓生产，费劲不小，效果不好”。现在听了毛主席的话，抓住了阶级斗争、两条道路斗争的纲，各项工作就改观了。特别在经过社会主义教育运动的曲阜、齐河、海阳等县，变化更为明显，仅仅一年时间，就解决了历史上遗留下的许多难题，在一九六五年获得了好收成。
    其次，许多干部思想上形而上学的东西比过去少了，注意学习和运用一分为二的观点观察问题和处理问题。比如曹县有些同志原来认为，全县人口多，碱洼地多，灾情重，条件差，对改造自然信心不足。可是运用一分为二的观点进行具体分析以后，他们认识到：人口多，干活的人也多，改造自然的力量就大；碱洼地多，产量虽然低，但增产潜力也大。把碱洼地改造好了，生产就会有较大发展。经过去年冬春的努力，这个县的生产面貌已经起了很大的变化。
    第三，深入实际，深入群众，实事求是，调查研究的风气开始形成了。许多同志遵照毛主席的指示，深入阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的第一线，进行调查研究和总结经验。这样做了的地方，出现了“五多五少”的新气象。五多是：了解下面情况的第一手材料多了，基层工作和群众工作经验多了，跟干部、积极分子和群众的接触多了，看问题辩证法多了，自己动手动脑的事多了。五少是：不切实际空头议论少了，脱离群众少了，形而上学少了，骄娇二气少了，身体小毛病少了。
    第四，毛主席关于“一切作长期打算”，“任何地方必须从开始工作的那一年起，就计算到将来的很多年”的教导，已成为不少干部的实际行动。许多县从本地的实际情况出发，制订了本地区社会主义建设的规划，并且稳步地付诸实现。
    第五，重视抓主要矛盾，集中力量打歼灭战。不少同志认识到，要把工作做得更有成效，就必须学会抓主要矛盾。有的县委的负责同志检查说，他们那里的农业生产发展不快，主要是因为没有抓准发展农业生产中的主要矛盾，年复一年地旱来抗旱，涝来抗涝，修修补补，催耕催种，结果自然条件不能根本改变。现在，他们开始改变这种被动的状况，比较注意集中力量解决关键性的问题。
    一切要上“纲”
    最近，山东省委常委专门召开会议，研究了今年的干部学习计划。省委认为，山东省县以上干部学习毛主席著作仅仅是开始，还有不少单位和个人学得不够好，在“用”字上下的功夫还差。
    会议决定，今年除了积极组织干部学好毛主席的四篇哲学著作，大立唯物辩证法，大破形而上学和烦琐哲学以外，要以学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论为重点，使广大干部牢固地树立备战思想，牢固地树立阶级斗争观点。总之，要在政治、经济、思想各条战线上狠抓阶级斗争这条纲，狠抓社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争这条纲。
    省委认为：要学好、用好毛主席著作，必须认真读书；必须有彻底的自我革命精神，把毛主席的教导首先用于改造自己的主观世界；必须结合工作和斗争学，真正把毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指导思想，把一切工作都归到毛泽东思想这个“纲”上来。
