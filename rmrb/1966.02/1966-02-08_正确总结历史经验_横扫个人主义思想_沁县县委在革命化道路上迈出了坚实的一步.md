    Qinxian County was very active in various tasks in 1958. However, after 1960, the work in this county went downhill. In 1964, the total agricultural output was even less than in 1949.

    In 1965, Qinxian County experienced a rare severe drought year. In addition to this, it also suffered from a frost disaster and three hailstorms. However, no one expected that in this year of many disasters, Qinxian County would experience a comprehensive upswing in all sectors, surpassing the favorable weather years of 1963 and 1964. The total grain output increased by 17.2 percent compared to 1964 and by 1.4 percent compared to 1958. Animal husbandry, forestry, and sideline occupations all experienced significant growth. From then on, the work in Qinxian County took on a new pace.

    The Direction of the General Line Must Be Upheld
    Why did such a great turnaround occur in 1965, despite the drought and numerous disasters? This must be discussed starting with the summary of historical experience.

    In February 1965, at the prefectural committee secretary meeting of the Jin Southeast District, everyone, through comparisons among various counties, discovered that Qinxian County had fallen behind. Comparing it to the entire province, Qinxian was the sixth from the bottom; comparing it to the entire district, Qinxian was at the bottom. After this news spread, comrades from various counties discussed it extensively, and the overall conclusion was: Qinxian County's work is like rowing upstream; if you don't advance, you retreat. Comrades from Qinxian felt even greater pressure, some not speaking at meetings, others blushing when they spoke. After the prefectural committee and the special district leaders noticed this, they promptly convened a symposium of leading cadres from Qinxian County and communes, providing ideological encouragement and work instructions.

    Based on the instructions from the prefectural committee, the Qinxian County Party Committee seized the opportunity to carry out the ideological revolutionization of the county committee. The slogan was: To make revolution, first revolutionize yourself; to make revolution, first rely on consciousness.

    When the county committee's revolutionization began, the first question discussed was whether Qinxian County had fallen behind. When this question was first raised, some comrades did not dare to face it squarely. Some said: "Qinxian County's work is like riding a donkey to Taiyuan; it's slower than a car, but much better than walking." Although most comrades did not agree with this statement, they could not grasp the fundamental problem of falling behind. There were various explanations: two years of disasters caused the work to fall behind; emphasis on combining work and rest affected the work; the steps taken in the previous years were too big, and now we can't keep up, and so on. Seeing that everyone was not getting to the heart of the matter, the comrade presiding over the meeting introduced the situation of Taigu County: Taigu County's population, land, and output are not much different from Qinxian County, but in 1964, it had already become the first county in the province with a per-mu yield of 400 jin, and the surplus grain sold alone was equivalent to Qinxian County's total output. The facts of Taigu were presented, causing a great shock. Why could Taigu go up? Why did Qinxian fall behind? Some asked questions, some answered, and the fundamental problem of Qinxian's backwardness quickly became clear. In previous years, Qinxian and Taigu were classmates, but in summarizing the experience of the previous years, they took two different paths. Taigu learned from its mistakes, adhered to the general line, affirmed what was correct, and corrected what was wrong. The leadership direction of the county committee became clearer, and the enthusiasm of the commune members became greater. As a result, water conservancy developed, and the degree of mechanization increased. What about Qinxian? When summarizing historical experience, instead of first affirming achievements, it first picked on the faults in the work. This did not clearly define right and wrong, did not affirm what was correct, and did not recognize what was wrong. The direction of advancement became blurred. For example: engaging in water conservancy occupied too much labor, so the work of engaging in water conservancy affected agricultural production was outright denied; the popularization of close planting failed to achieve a reasonable reduction in output, so it was thought that close planting was not suitable for Qinxian; farmland construction ruined the soil layer because there was no technical guidance, and it was insisted that deep plowing could not increase production; it was clearly a problem of lack of work experience, but it was thought that there was a problem with the direction of development. At that time, the county committee leadership turned a bit, and did not support what was correct or criticize what was wrong. Thus, not only was historical experience not summarized well, but it also developed into abandoning leadership. For example: commune members planted small plots in the forest area, and the county committee did not care; reservoirs had water but did not irrigate the fields, and the county committee did not ask; collective sheep flocks were distributed to households, and the county committee ignored it...

    Through discussions of presenting facts and reasoning, the county committee members further raised their awareness and unified their understanding. Everyone unanimously recognized that the work of the previous years was not a problem of methods in the work, but a problem of not adhering to the direction of the general line.

    Why Didn't the County Committee Dare to Make Revolution?
    Why didn't they dare to hold high the red flag of the general line and carry out the revolution to the end? Some comrades examined themselves and said: Because the work we did in the previous years was not carefully summarized, the line between right and wrong was unclear, and it became a case of "once bitten by a snake, ten years afraid of well ropes." Therefore, the idea of "struggling to be upstream is tiring, being downstream is wrong, and being in the middle stream is safe" arose.

    Why was the revolutionary spirit not strong? After careful analysis, everyone focused on the word "dare": they dared not think about revolutionary cause, dared not do revolutionary work, and dared not break into revolutionary paths. In short, revolutionary thought was bound by the word "dare" from top to bottom, left and right. Then, why didn't a revolutionary dare to make revolution? After searching and searching, the word "fear" was found. For example: if you say too much, you are afraid people will say "bragging"; if you work too hard, you are afraid people will say "reckless"; if you manage too broadly, you are afraid people will say "showing off"; if you offend the leaders, you are afraid of affecting your promotion; if you criticize comrades, you are afraid of hurting feelings; if you don't follow everyone, you are afraid of getting a bad reputation. Afraid of this and afraid of that, but not afraid of not doing a good job of revolutionary work. What is the problem? After discussing it again and again, it all came down to the word "I." If the work is done well, it is "my" credit; if there is a problem, it is "not my" responsibility; if there is honor, "I" take the lead; if there are difficulties, "I" avoid them. For example: the work in Qinxian County has long been behind, but many committee members still feel at ease and say: the work in recent years has been "stable," "detailed," and "solid" compared to the past. Isn't this hurting yourself? Discussing this, everyone finally came to the conclusion based on the facts: it's not that Qinxian's work is "stable," but that they are afraid to make revolution for the sake of the word "I." Because they dared not make revolution ideologically and didn't work to make revolution, it brought about a chain reaction. As everyone examined themselves and said: If thoughts are not correct, the style of work is skewed; the good ones leave, and the bad ones come. For example, some don't go out when the weather is bad; some don't stay overnight when going to the countryside and don't go to small mountain villages... With such a low revolutionary spirit, can they still lead the work of a county well?

    After Having Revolutionary Spirit
    In March 1965, Comrade Yang Shupei, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, made a serious self-criticism on behalf of the County Party Committee at the county-level expanded cadre meeting. At the same time, he commended 73 county, commune, and team cadres who had consistently worked actively. Comrades attending the meeting said: This meeting is unusual. The secretary makes a self-criticism, the committee members make self-criticism, the revolutionary faction is commended, and new tasks are proposed. Everyone saw that the County Party Committee was seriously examining itself and determined to correct itself and determined to change the face of Qinxian. As a result, many commune and brigade cadres also spoke at the meeting. Some criticized the county committee leadership, some made self-examinations, and some expressed their determination, turning the production mobilization meeting into an ideological revolution meeting. In this way, the county committee examined itself, everyone helped, the county committee took responsibility, everyone unified their understanding, the county committee moved everyone, and everyone promoted the county committee. On the basis of correctly summarizing historical experience, various production tasks were successfully arranged.

    The Qinxian County Party Committee, after ideological revolutionization, transformed its work into combat readiness. The day after the county-level expanded cadre meeting, 14 members of the County Party Committee, leading 69 heads of departments and 319 county and commune cadres, took Mao Zedong's works and labor tools and went deep into the front line of production. They all took the initiative after gaining power through labor practice and then commanded production. In the spring, they sowed seeds and planted seedlings with the commune members; in the summer, they weeded and thinned seedlings with the commune members; especially in the fight against drought and protection of seedlings, many leading comrades carried water to irrigate the seedlings together with the commune members. During the busy season, they launched a major revolution in the government agencies and moved the County Party Committee meeting to the countryside, turning the county-level agencies into "empty cities." The change in the work style of the County Party Committee leadership greatly encouraged and promoted the change in the work style of cadres at the three levels of the county, commune, and team. It is true that the higher the enthusiasm of the leaders, the higher the enthusiasm of those below. The number of cadres staying at designated points increased from 150 in the past to more than 400, and they were able to put ideology in command and excel in labor. In 1965, the time they spent staying at designated points exceeded the total of the past two years. Under the leadership of the county and commune leaders, the team cadres took the lead in working and doing heavy work. The number of actual workdays in 1965 increased by more than 20% compared to 1964. Dong Erhui, a commune member of Dengjiao Brigade, reduced his work input and did not apply fertilizer in 1964. In 1965, he made a big change. In addition to regularly participating in collective labor, he also put all 140 loads of good fertilizer into the team. The team cadres persuaded him to keep a few loads for his private plot, but he repeatedly refused and said: "Secretary Miao helped us collect manure, and County Chief Li carried water to irrigate the seedlings. The leading cadres are still working for us, and we can no longer play petty tricks..." In order to ensure that all crops have full seedlings, the county committee led cadres and commune members to transplant 10 million seedlings in ten days. In order to turn dry land into paddy fields, all members of the county committee went out and led the masses to open main and branch canals totaling 1,000 li in length. In order to overcome the drought and seize a bumper harvest, the secretary and county chief carried yokes and led the commune members to carry 10 million loads of water... Can all these vivid deeds be said to be just a change in work style? No, this is a revolutionary fruit born of revolutionary spirit.

    正确总结历史经验　横扫个人主义思想
    ——沁县县委在革命化道路上迈出了坚实的一步
    沁县在一九五八年各项工作很活跃。但是，一九六○年以后，这个县的工作，走开了下坡路。一九六四年，农业总产量还比不上一九四九年。
    一九六五年，沁县是个罕见的大旱年。除此以外，还遭过一次冻灾、三次雹灾。然而，谁都没有料到，在这个多灾的年头里，沁县却比风调雨顺的一九六三年和一九六四年，来了个各业俱兴。粮食总产量比一九六四年增长了百分之十七点二，比一九五八年增长了百分之一点四；畜牧业、林业、副业都有很大程度的增长。从此，沁县的工作，迈开了新的步伐。
    必须坚持总路线的方向
    为什么一九六五年天旱灾多，却来了个大转弯呢？这得从总结历史经验谈起。
    一九六五年二月里，在晋东南地委召开的全区公社党委书记会议上，大家在各县对比之中，发现沁县落后了。在全省比，沁县是倒数第六，全区比，沁县垫了榜底。这一消息传开后，各县的同志议论纷纷，总的结论是：沁县的工作是逆水行舟，不进则退。沁县同志，压力更大，有的开会不发言，有的说话脸红。地委和专区领导察觉后，及时召开了沁县县、社领导干部座谈会，给予了思想上的鼓励和工作上的指示。
    沁县县委根据地委指示，趁热打铁地进行了县委的思想革命化。口号是：革命先革自己命，革命首先靠自觉。
    县委革命化开始，首先讨论沁县是不是落后了？这个问题刚提出，有的同志还不敢正视。有人说：“沁县的工作是骑上毛驴上太原，比上汽车咱就慢，比上步行强得多。”大部分同志，虽然不同意这种说法，但也抓不住落后的根本问题。有各种各样的说法：闹了二年灾荒，工作拉下空啦；这几年强调劳逸结合，工作受了影响；前几年步子迈的大，现在赶不上，等等。主持会议的同志，看到大家不上纲，把太谷的情况作了介绍：太谷县的人口、土地、产量，和沁县不差上下，可是人家在一九六四年，已成为全省第一个亩产四百斤县，仅出售的余粮，就相当于沁县的总产量。太谷的事实一摆，震动很大。太谷为啥能上去？沁县为啥落了后？有的发问，有的回答，沁县落后的根本问题，很快就明朗化了。前几年，沁县和太谷是一榜进士，可是在总结前几年的经验时，就走成两条路。太谷是吃一堑长一智，坚持了总路线，肯定了正确的，纠正了错误的，县委领导方向更明了，社员干劲更大了，所以，水利发展了，机械化程度提高了。沁县呢？在总结历史经验时，不是首先肯定成绩，而是先挑工作中的毛病，这样是非界限没划清，正确的没有肯定，错误的没有认识，前进的方向模糊了。比如：搞水利多占了点劳力，就一口否定搞水利影响农业生产；推广密植没有做到合理减了产，就认为密植在沁县不适用；农田建设因为没有技术指导搞乱了土层，硬说是深翻土地就不能增产；明明是工作没经验出了点毛病，却认为是发展方向有问题。在当时，县委领导，有点转向，正确的没有支持，错误的没有批判。这样，不仅没总结好历史经验，而且发展到放弃领导。比如：社员把林区种成小块地，县委不管；水库有水不浇田，县委不问；集体羊群下放到户，县委不理……。
    通过摆事实讲道理的讨论，县委们进一步提高了觉悟，统一了认识。大家一致认识到：前几年的工作，不是工作中的方法问题，而是没有坚持总路线的方向问题。
    县委为什么不敢革命
    为什么不敢高举总路线红旗革命到底呢？有的同志检查说：前几年咱干的工作，因为没有认真加以总结，是非界限不清，弄成“一朝被蛇咬，十年怕井绳”了。因此就产生了“争上游受累，居下游不对，当中游保险”的思想。
    革命精神不振，这是什么原因呢？大家认真分析以后，都集中在“不敢”二字上：革命的事业不敢想，革命的工作不敢做，革命的道路不敢闯。总之，上下左右被“不敢”二字束缚了革命思想。那么，一个革命者为啥又不敢革命了呢？找来找去，找出个“怕”字。比如：说得多了，怕人说“瞎吹”；干劲大了，怕人提“冒失”；管得宽了，怕人说“逞能”；得罪了领导，怕影响提拔；批评了同志，怕伤了感情；不随上大家，怕落下骂名。怕这怕那，就是不怕把革命工作搞不好。这又是什么问题呢？讨论来讨论去，都归到了“我”字上。工作好了，“我”的功劳；出了问题，“我”没责任；有了荣誉，“我”占前头；有了困难，“我”就躲走。比如：沁县的工作早就落后了，不少委员还心安理得说：这几年工作比上过去“稳”啦，“细”啦，“实”啦，这不是自己害自己吗？大家讨论到这里，最后根据事实得出结论说：不是沁县工作“稳”啦，而是为了“我”字不敢革命啦。由于思想上不敢革命，工作上不去革命，所以带来了连锁反应。正如大家检查说：思想不正作风歪，好的走了坏的来。比如，有的是气候不好不出门；有的是下乡不住夜，不去小山庄；……革命思想如此低落，还能领导好一个县的工作吗？
      有了革命精神之后
    一九六五年三月，县委副书记杨树培同志代表县委，在全县三级扩干会上认真作了检讨，同时，表扬了一贯积极工作的七十三名县社队干部。与会同志说：这次会议不寻常，书记作检讨，委员自我批评，表彰革命派，提出新任务。大家看到县委认真检讨，决心改正，为改变沁县面貌下了狠心。于是，有不少公社和大队干部也在大会上发了言。有的批评县委领导，有的作自我检查，有的是表示决心，把个动员生产会变成了个思想革命会。就这样，县委检查，大家帮助，县委承担责任，大家统一认识，县委感动大家，大家促进县委，在正确总结历史经验的基础上，顺利地布置了各项生产任务。
    沁县县委，经过思想革命化，工作上变成战斗化，县扩干会后的第二天，十四名县委委员，带领了六十九名科局长和三百一十九名县社干部，带着毛主席著作和劳动工具，深入生产第一线。他们都是通过劳动实践，取得主动权后，再来指挥生产。春季，他们和社员一块下籽点种；夏季，他们又和社员锄草、间苗；特别在抗旱保苗中，很多领导同志，跟社员一块担水浇苗。大忙时期，他们来了个机关大革命，把县委会议搬到乡下开，县级机关变成“空城计”。县委领导作风的转变，大大鼓舞和促进了县社队三级干部作风的改变，真是领导干劲高一尺，下边干劲高一丈。蹲点的干部，由过去的一百五十名增加到四百多名，并且做到了思想挂帅，劳动过硬。一九六五年，他们蹲点的时间超过过去二年的总和。在县社领导干部的带动下，队干部都是带头干，做重活，一九六五年的实做工数，比一九六四年提高了百分之二十多。灯角大队社员董二会，一九六四年少入工，不投肥，一九六五年，来了个大转变，除经常参加集体劳动外，还把一百四十担好肥料全部投到队里，队干部劝他留几担上自留地，他再三拒绝说：“苗书记帮助咱拾粪，李县长担水浇苗，领导干部还为咱出力，咱不能再打小算盘……。”为了保证庄稼全苗，县委带领干部社员，十天移苗一千万株；为了变旱地为水田，县委委员全部出动，带领群众开干支渠共长达一千华里；为了战胜干旱夺丰收，书记、县长肩挑扁担，带领社员担水一千万担……。这一切生动的事迹，能说只是工作作风的改变吗？不是，这是革命精神结出的革命硕果。
