　　Dialectics Teaches People to Be Clever
　　——Enlightenment from the Trial Production of Double Water-Cooled Turbogenerators
　　Ding Xiaorun
    Under the leadership of the Party, Chinese workers, scientific researchers, and technicians have successfully manufactured double water-cooled turbogenerators through socialist large-scale collaboration. This is a major innovation in China's electrical machinery industry and a significant achievement in China's science and technology. It is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a victory for materialist dialectics.
    The achievement of creating double water-cooled turbogenerators demonstrates that to win a battle in production and science, and to achieve significant accomplishments in science and technology, we must rely on Mao Zedong Thought and first win a battle in ideology and politics, using dialectics to overcome metaphysics. Some people have doubted whether we are inherently smarter than others. How can we achieve what others have not yet achieved with relatively poor material and technical conditions? Practice has proven that under the socialist system, as long as we apply Mao Zedong Thought and use dialectics as a sharp weapon, we can fully liberate the intelligence and talent of the broad masses of working people. They become increasingly intelligent in practice and are fully capable of doing things that others have not yet done.

　　Catching Up Is the Universal Law of Development
    China's manufacturing of generators has always followed in the footsteps of others. In 1958, when the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory was formulating its development plan, it faced a problem: Should it continue to follow behind others forever, or should it break free from conventions and forge its own path? Inspired and encouraged by Zhejiang University and other fraternal departments, the masses of workers resolutely chose the latter. Some Western capitalist countries, since they began manufacturing generators in the 1880s, have increasingly encountered the acute contradiction between power generation capacity and motor heating. On the one hand, production practice requires a motor to generate more electricity; on the other hand, when more electricity is generated, the powerful current passing through the coils inside the machine generates high heat, which can burn out the motor. Therefore, the key to having a generator generate more electricity is to find ways to take away the heat generated by the strong current more quickly and efficiently. For a long time, generators have mainly developed around improving cooling technology.
    In foreign countries, the initial method was air cooling, blowing air from the outside of the copper wires. This method is very simple. However, because each copper wire is wrapped in a thick layer of insulation, it's like a person wearing a fur coat and fanning themselves—not very effective. In 1938, hydrogen gas was used instead, which was like replacing a palm leaf fan with an electric fan, resulting in a greater cooling effect. However, the cooling effect was still limited due to that thick "fur coat." In 1951, "external cooling" was changed to "internal cooling," fundamentally changing the cooling method by allowing hydrogen gas to pass through hollow copper coils, greatly improving the cooling effect. As early as the 1930s, some people considered fundamentally changing the cooling medium, replacing gas with water. The cooling effect of water is about 50 times that of air and 12 to 15 times that of hydrogen. If water internal cooling is adopted, it's like letting the motor drink iced soda, which can greatly increase power generation capacity. This is of great significance for developing larger capacity generators. However, water internal cooling technology is very complex. It wasn't until 1956 that stator water internal cooling appeared (the stator part is stationary, making water passage relatively simple), while the high-speed rotating rotor part was still hydrogen internal cooled. This is the long road that foreign countries have taken.
    Following behind others, based on air-cooling technology, we could only first develop hydrogen cooling, and only after others developed rotor water internal cooling could we advance to "double water internal cooling" technology, where both the rotor and stator use water internal cooling.
    Some people believe that this is the inevitable path for the development of generators, an insurmountable "conventional" practice. Our development plan, no matter how fast, could not avoid first developing hydrogen cooling. Influenced by this thinking, the initial plan was to produce a hydrogen internal cooled motor in 1962, which was later revised to achieve rotor hydrogen internal cooling and stator water internal cooling by 1960. However, the broad masses of workers were not satisfied. They said, why is the old path that others have taken an unchangeable "conventional" practice? Why can't we catch up from behind and surpass them? Today, the demand for generator capacity is increasing, and hydrogen cooling will be limited to a certain extent. Water cooling has become a historical need. From the perspective of development, hydrogen cooling is, in a sense, a preparation for water cooling. It prepares the necessary conditions for water cooling in terms of motor structure and technology. By using dialectics as our ideological weapon, we can summarize the experience of others and grasp the entire history of generator development. We can seize the fundamental direction, stand on high ground, and advance like a hot knife through butter, directly moving towards the peak of development. Therefore, the masses of workers strongly demanded to skip hydrogen cooling and directly attack the cutting-edge technology of double water internal cooling.
    Others said that even if skipping is possible, we must not forget our own specific conditions. We used to imitate others. Now, we have just learned to walk and want to jump, which is "overestimating our capabilities." Speaking of material conditions, we are indeed relatively poor. However, we have the spirit of daring to make revolution and a strong desire for innovation. Our leap also meets the requirements of the development of productive forces. As long as we give full play to the role of existing material conditions and make full use of the equipment, experience, and technical strength accumulated over the years of manufacturing air-cooled generators, we can leap. In fact, weren't other fraternal units also successful in conducting experiments on small motors with equally simple conditions at that time? This greatly encouraged the workers of the electric machinery factory. Of course, certain material conditions are important. But more important is people, is people's thinking. Chairman Mao said: "Conditions can be prepared while doing." As long as we have the spirit of daring to make revolution, even if the conditions are not perfect for the time being, we can give full play to people's subjective initiative, understand and apply objective laws, transform spirit into material strength, and gradually improve the conditions.
    Some people worried, what if we fail? Wouldn't it be more certain and less loss if we did hydrogen cooling first? The masses also discussed this issue. Since it is innovation, it is revolution. There are always two possibilities: success and failure. We can't avoid taking some "risks." Even if we fail, as long as we summarize the experience and learn the lessons, we can prepare the necessary conditions for success and become a positive factor in promoting success. Some things are lost, and others can be gained. Even if we pay a little "tuition," it is insignificant compared to the achievements we will achieve in the future. After analyzing the problem thoroughly, the masses became even more determined. At the same time, the masses also pointed out that we should also be prepared for the possibility of failure and try to pay as little "tuition" as possible. Therefore, they decided to build a "one to two" generator first (a generator of the same size can increase power generation by one time), instead of building a "one to four" generator all at once (a generator of the same size can increase power generation by three times), as some people suggested. Starting with something simpler, the chances of success are greater. Moreover, if we use the rotor shaft of an air-cooled generator for trial production and fail, we can still convert it to air-cooled, avoiding significant losses.
    Catching up is the universal law of development. For latecomers to "catch up," the key lies in leaping, in surpassing certain stages that predecessors have gone through. In the development of human society, even some backward capitalist countries can leap and surpass some advanced capitalist countries. The socialist system releases social productive forces unprecedentedly, so of course it must leap even more. Revolutionaries must consciously apply this dialectical law and leap better and faster. The workers of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory wanted to leap, and they thought completely correctly. If they didn't want to leap, they would have to follow behind others forever, and naturally, they wouldn't catch up. Isn't that the biggest "abnormality"?
    This is a matter of daring to make revolution. Only by first solving this problem can we further solve the problems of how to carry out this revolution and how to be good at revolution in the process of experimentation, research, design, and trial production.

　　Close Combination of Experimentation, Research, Design, and Trial Production
    Now that the direction has been determined, how do we start? There are two different approaches here, reflecting two different viewpoints and methods.
    Some people believe that creating double water-cooled turbogenerators is a major project that must be carried out "step by step": first, scientific researchers conduct research in laboratories and research rooms to solve all the theoretical doubts; then, designers draw up a complete set of construction blueprints; and finally, trial production can be carried out in the workshop. The three stages do not allow any overlap, otherwise it will disrupt the normal order.
    The masses of workers opposed this approach. They believed that since it is innovation, there is no ready-made information to rely on, and research work and design work must be closely linked to trial production and production practice, so that experimentation, research, design, and trial production are combined. Researchers and designers must also be closely linked with the broad masses of workers under the unified leadership of the Party, and implement the "three combinations" of workers, technicians, and leading cadres, and the "three combinations" of factories, research units, and schools.
    Let's take experimental research as an example. Manufacturing water-cooled motors initially encountered a series of theoretical problems: Can water enter under the tremendous centrifugal force caused by the high-speed rotation of the rotor? Can it flow normally inside the rotor? Will vibrations occur and disrupt the dynamic balance of the rotor? Obviously, it is very important to obtain various necessary data through experimental research to clarify these issues. Otherwise, if the principle is not sound, reliable construction design drawings cannot be drawn, and it will be impossible to formally put it into production. Therefore, the question here is not whether or not to conduct experimental research, but how to conduct experimental research. If we only proceed from existing theories and conduct research in laboratories and research rooms, we can only repeat the old path taken by some foreigners. They began research in the 1930s and solved some problems, but they never completely solved the fundamental problems of water intake, water flow, and dynamic balance. Using their theories not only cannot help solve problems, but also becomes a constraint that hinders solving problems.
    The masses opposed such "research." They believed that laboratory experiments have their characteristics. Generally speaking, they often artificially create certain specific conditions to allow certain processes to proceed in a pure form, which allows one to put aside all irrelevant secondary factors. This is undoubtedly very important in scientific research. However, its limitations also lie here: it simplifies problems that are actually very complex and abstracts multi-factors into single factors. Every practical problem in innovation is comprehensive and contains many factors. Some problems simply cannot be solved in the laboratory and must be tested in the workshop with real guns and swords. Therefore, experimental research must be combined with design, especially with trial production, and researchers must leave the laboratory and research room, go deep into the workshop, and participate in trial production. Because of this, the comrades who participated in the trial production of double water-cooled turbogenerators were able to successfully solve some problems that foreign countries had long been unable to solve in a short period of time.
    At the same time, this approach allowed the masses of workers to directly participate in the research work, which greatly improved the quality of the research work. The masses of workers are direct producers. They can not only provide the rich practical experience that researchers lack, but also understand the specific requirements of experimental research, and can more consciously carry out trial production and use their personal experience to help solve some theoretical problems. With this combination, the theoretical knowledge of the researchers also becomes richer and more lively, becoming a sharper weapon for solving practical problems.
    The same is true for design work. It cannot be completely separated from experimental research and trial production. Some people, influenced by traditional design methods, always want the designers to produce a complete design first, so that the design work can be "accomplished in one battle," and then hand it over to the workers to manufacture according to the drawings. Unfortunately, this will not work in innovation. Design is also a plan and program for manufacturing. It is itself a summary of previous production practice experience. Just as Chairman Mao said, "The people of society throw themselves into the practice of transforming a certain objective process within a certain stage of development," thereby "creating thoughts, theories, plans, or programs that are generally corresponding to the laws of that objective process" ("On Practice"). Similarly, only by throwing oneself into the practice process of manufacturing double water-cooled generators can one form a complete design that reflects the laws of this practice process. Before the first double water-cooled generator has been manufactured, how can a complete design of this type of generator appear? In fact, neither the first steam engine nor the first generator had complete construction drawings. They were gradually explored through experimentation and production practice. If we must completely design it before trial production, we will repeat the old path of those foreigners, and it is very likely that we will design for many years without solving the key problem of rotor water passage like them. The masses of workers opposed taking this path. They started with a schematic sketch of rotor water passage, experimenting, designing, and trial-producing at the same time, starting from reality, from nothing to something, from small to large, from simple to complex, and finally gradually came up with a more complete design.
    Some people feel that doing so requires experimentation, research, design, and trial production at the same time, which will lead to more complexity and waste more time. In fact, on the contrary, it greatly saves time. By doing so, those who are capable can start first, without waiting for the entire set of drawings. More importantly, the experience of trial production can be summarized in a timely manner and reflected in the design. Each part of the design can be tested in trial production at any time, problems can be discovered and corrected in a timely manner, and errors can be revised. Designing in this way, modifying while doing, is flexible and mobile, and of course it is more efficient than building behind closed doors and having to tear down everything and start over if there is any discrepancy.
    The combination of design and trial production fundamentally promotes the combination of designers and the masses of workers. To carry out design in the trial production process, designers must go downstairs and out of the courtyard, go deep into the field, and listen to the opinions of the masses of workers. The masses of workers participate in the design, put forward programs, offer ideas, and provide the richest materials for the design work, greatly supplementing the shortcomings of the designers in practical experience. Of course, the practical experience provided by the masses of workers is often fragmented and simple, and it still needs to be refined and distilled. Here, the theoretical knowledge of the designers and the technology of calculation and drawing are needed. However, this is not what some people think. Designers can close their doors and "refine." In fact, the shift from perceptual knowledge to rational knowledge must go through repeated practice. Perceptual knowledge and rational knowledge can only be unified on the basis of the practice of the masses. On every technical key, they all go through mass "Zhuge Liang meetings," discussing and experimenting at the same time, comparing various programs, learning from each other's strengths, and finally refining a better design program. This is the most thorough mass line in design work.
    Through the combination of experimental research, design, and trial production, the first double water-cooled turbogenerator was manufactured. This is a great victory. However, the entire manufacturing project did not end there. The first unit was inherently experimental and could not be perfect. For this new thing, we must "warmly" and "strictly": affirm the achievements and support them with enthusiasm, and also face the shortcomings squarely and demand strict requirements. We must continue to conduct experimental research, revise the original design, make improvements, and trial-produce new water-cooled motors in the actual operation and use of this generator. This means that not only should we adopt this combined approach in the trial production process, but also continue to adopt this approach in the process of use.
    Why is this necessary? The workers said it well: people's understanding of power generation technology is endless, and people's struggle to extract power from nature is also endless. The practice of manufacturing the first double water-cooled generator provides people with the most basic understanding of this type of generator. However, this understanding is limited. In this practice, some contradictions inside the motor were exposed and resolved. Some contradictions were not exposed and were not resolved. These contradictions often have a process of development from hidden to obvious. Only in long-term use practice can we further expose the problems in the structure, process, and materials of the motor, further verify the principle, test the performance, and accumulate data, so as to obtain a more complete understanding. Only manufacturing, regardless of use, only trial production in the electric machinery factory, but not close cooperation with power plants, and continuing to improve in use, is metaphysics. They opposed this metaphysics and implemented not only the "three combinations" of workers, technicians, and leading cadres in the factory, but also the "three combinations" of manufacturing units, research units, and user units outside the factory, and implemented the mass line on a broader basis. The continuous improvement of the new thing of double water-cooled motors, like its birth, cannot be imagined without socialist large-scale collaboration and the strong support of various fraternal units, especially user units.
    Through practice, the workers deeply realized that whether or not to closely combine experimental research, design, and trial production is not a simple question of approach, but a question of whether or not to link with production practice and whether or not to implement the mass line in innovation. Practice produces wisdom, and the masses produce wisdom. To do things well and cleverly, we must be good at drawing strength from this inexhaustible source of wisdom, and we must act in accordance with the Marxist theory of knowledge and dialectics, and oppose metaphysics that isolates experimental research, design, and trial production from each other, isolates workers, technicians, and leading cadres from each other, and isolates manufacturing from use, and manufacturing units from user units.

Dialectically Viewing the Relationship Between Inheritance and Innovation, Learning and Creation
    In the design and trial production process of double water-cooled generators, we also encountered the problem of where to start and how to treat the original foundation of the generator. Should we completely discard the original structure of the air-cooled generator, start from scratch, and do everything from the beginning? Or should we innovate on the original basis? The correct approach should be to, in the process of creating double water-cooled generators, temporarily maintain and utilize everything in the original technology that can be used, concentrate efforts on solving the fundamental problems in innovation, and then gradually solve other relatively minor problems.
    Of course, in principle, everyone also admits that innovation must be carried out on the original basis, and the basic theory and basic structure of the generator cannot be changed all at once. However, when it comes to specific problems, some designers always want to take this opportunity to make a change. They always feel that to innovate, it is better to innovate thoroughly. Later, after everyone's analysis, they felt that this spirit was good. Strategically speaking, innovation is to discard the old and establish the new, and bring forth the new from the old. Without negating the old and overthrowing the old, new things will never appear. However, tactically speaking, we must pay attention to the difficulties in innovation, shorten the battle line as much as possible, eat one bite at a time, take one step at a time, and use limited forces on the edge of the knife. Therefore, they advocated innovating on the original basis and opposed the view of starting everything from scratch.
    Innovating on the original basis is to not sever the history of technological development and to correctly handle the relationship between inheritance and innovation. Any new technology is developed on the basis of existing technology. To demand that everything be new and to excessively negate the original structure of air-cooled generators will increase the difficulty of design and trial production, and the result will not only be prolonged and delayed, but even complicate the problem, so that it cannot be produced at all. We first inherited the reasonable factors in the structure of air-cooled generators. Some basic structures and basic processes in the two major components, the stator and the rotor, can be temporarily untouched and will be temporarily untouched. In this way, not only is the amount of design work greatly reduced, but also the difficulties in trial production are reduced; moreover, we can start immediately and do the parts that can be done first, greatly saving time. Therefore, innovation is negation, but not complete negation, but a one-dividing-into-two negation on the basis of affirming reasonable things. Severing history is not conducive to the birth of new things.
    Will innovating on the original basis lose the meaning of innovation? No. The difference between new things and old things often does not lie in the quantity, but in the key one or two points. The difference between double water-cooled generators and existing generators lies only in the passage of water in the stator and rotor. Here, the main thing is to solve the problem of the normal circulation of water in the stator and rotor. Innovation is to firmly grasp these fundamental problems and not to demand that everything be new all at once.
    The water passage problem, specifically speaking, includes the water passage problem of the stator and the water passage problem of the rotor. Some comrades are eager for success and want to do both at the same time and succeed in one fell swoop. Everyone made a further analysis of these two problems. Although both require innovation, they must also be prioritized. Here, the water passage problem of the rotor is the most complex. It is a great contradiction for water to circulate regularly in a rotor that is constantly rotating at a high speed of 3,000 revolutions per minute. As the workers said, "The advantage of manufacturing double water-cooled generators is brought by water, and the harm is also brought by water." The difficulty lies here. This is the main contradiction. The rotor turns so fast, can water enter? Can it flow normally inside? Will it disrupt the balance of the rotor? Can it leak out? How should the water system be arranged? These are all manifestations of this main contradiction. Once the main contradiction is solved, the problem of passing water into the stationary stator can be easily solved. If we treat them equally, "hitting people with two fists" will disperse our strength and lose sight of the other. Therefore, in the process of innovation, we must analyze the contradictions and grasp the main contradictions.
    Here, there is also the problem of learning from all walks of life and correctly handling the relationship between learning and creation. Some people believe that since it is a problem that occurs in the process of innovation, it is impossible to find anything similar or identical. Influenced by this thinking, when solving the water intake sealing problem, we initially just fiddled around in our own factory, and the problem was still not solved. Later, after the leaders' enlightenment, we went out to run around and learned from the experience of shipbuilding factories and other units, transplanted their sealing technology to the generator, and the problem was solved very smoothly. This made everyone realize that if we are confined to our narrow world, isolate ourselves, and do not understand the vast world outside, we will be conservative and stick to old ways, and fall into metaphysics. On the contrary, by learning earnestly from others, we can make up for our shortcomings with others' strengths.
    The structure of the air-cooled generator that was originally retained cannot be regarded absolutely. The parts that are inherited can be temporarily untouched. However, when the generator is further developed, the specific requirements for each part will also change, and the original structure cannot fully adapt to this requirement, so there must be corresponding changes. Some people look at problems with a fixed viewpoint, as if the reserved structure can remain unchanged forever and does not need to be further reformed. This is also metaphysics. In fact, after the double water-cooled generator basically solved the water passage problem, in order to adapt to the needs of water passage, the structure that was originally retained is also constantly being improved.
    The relationship between inheritance and innovation, learning and creation is dialectical. Only by using dialectics can we conform to the original appearance of things, correctly handle their relationship, correctly solve the problems of inheritance and innovation, learning and creation, and carry out innovation quickly, economically, and well.

　　A Scalpel—Specific Analysis of Specific Problems
    The process of manufacturing water-cooled motors is an arduous and complex struggle with nature. To win this struggle, we must use our brains and conduct specific analysis of specific contradictions.
    To analyze contradictions, we must first analyze the particularity of contradictions. Taking the problem of water circuit sealing as an example, on the one hand, it is required that water run according to the specified water circuit, and on the other hand, it is required that water not leak out of the specified water circuit. This is a contradiction that runs through all water circuits. On the other hand, the specific requirements for the sealing problem are different in different parts of the motor. In other words, the same problem has different characteristics under different conditions. For example, inside the rotor, the requirements are indeed very strict. It is necessary to achieve "seamlessness" and not allow a drop of water to seep out. In other parts of the rotor, the situation is different. Taking the water inlet as an example, although it is also required to be leak-proof, since it is located outside the rotor, the sealing requirement is not as strict as that inside the rotor. As long as the water supply can be satisfied, a slight leakage is acceptable. Taking the water outlet as an example, the sealing requirements are different from those of the water inlet. The water outlet, as the name suggests, is to allow water to flow out of the rotor. The sealing here is only required to prevent splashing everywhere and discharge it according to the specified channels. However, some people initially ignored this feature and only thought of blocking, and as a result, the less smooth the water flow, the bigger the sealing problem. Later, an old master came up with an idea, like "Yu the Great controlling the flood," using dredging instead of blocking, the sealing requirements were reduced, and the problem was solved more easily. Some people believe that this was originally a very simple problem, but it was only blocked for a while, and there is no need to talk about dialectics at all. In fact, it is not true. Many things seem very simple once they are pointed out. But in advance, people are always easy to think along one path, and the more they think, the narrower the path becomes, and they enter a dead end. With dialectics, it will help people think from all aspects, do more specific analysis, and take fewer detours.
    To analyze contradictions, we must also analyze the two sides of contradictions and conduct a comprehensive comparison. On some specific key issues, some people often only see one side and fall into one-sidedness. This is the case with the coil structure form. There can be two different forms of coil structure: coarse and fine. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Which structure is better? We cannot stay at the abstract discussion. We must compare these two structures in practice, comprehensively weigh the pros and cons, seek advantages and avoid disadvantages, or take the greater advantage and the smaller disadvantage. Some people at that time did not do this. They rigidly applied certain literature materials, grasped one structure form, and only saw its advantages and did not see its disadvantages. The masses opposed this way of looking at problems one-sidedly. They experimented with both structures and adopted them separately in practice. In this way, after specific analysis and comparison, they achieved a more complete understanding of both.
    Comparison is the unity of opposites. After trying these two structures, the two opposing sides, coarse and fine, are fully developed in practice, and they also fully demonstrate their respective positive and negative sides, strengths and weaknesses. If you don't compare everything, if you don't compare and establish opposing sides, you will know which is advantageous, which is disadvantageous, which is more advantageous and less disadvantageous, and which is less advantageous and more disadvantageous. If you do not conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis of the two coil structures, if you only see the part and not the whole, you will not be able to correctly solve the coil structure problem according to the specific requirements of each motor.
    To analyze contradictions, we must also analyze the mutual transformation of contradictions under different conditions. Things always go to their opposites under certain conditions. The pair of contradictions between favorable and unfavorable is also the same. Under certain conditions, the favorable can be transformed into the unfavorable, and the harmful can be transformed into the harmless. On the problem of the water outlet structure of the rotor, the masses used this analysis method and opposed looking at the favorable and unfavorable of a certain structure statically and unchanged.
    When the rotor exits water, the water outlet can be opened in the rear part of the motor or in the front part. Generally speaking, the water circuit layout is relatively simple for rear water outlet, and the processing is also relatively convenient. This is an advantage. But there are also unreasonable aspects in the use of materials. This is a disadvantage. The opposite is true for front water outlet. The material use is more reasonable, but the water circuit layout and processing technology are more complex. Which one is better? It depends on the specific conditions. When the conditions change, the more advantages and fewer disadvantages and the fewer advantages and more disadvantages can be transformed into each other. When manufacturing the first water-cooled motor, everything had just begun, and everything was waiting to be done. As long as the water outlet structure can be used, so as not to delay time. At this time, the rear water outlet structure has more advantages and fewer disadvantages. Later, after preliminary practice, the conditions changed: on the one hand, it is necessary to further improve the quality of the generator and improve the rationality of material use; on the other hand, certain experiences have also been accumulated in manufacturing, processing, and other aspects. At this time, the front water outlet became more advantageous and less disadvantageous. Some people do not understand this principle and always cling to one structure, as if once it is adopted, it will be used forever. They do not understand that the objective situation is constantly developing, and under certain conditions, things always go to their opposites. If thinking lags behind reality, and you do not specifically analyze specific conditions, you cannot consciously promote this transformation, and you cannot stand at the forefront of scientific and technological development to act as a guide.
    Does it still need to continue to transform? Yes. As water-cooled generators are made larger and larger, new problems have appeared in the water circuit layout and processing; and the use of materials has been continuously improved and is more reasonable than before. In this case, the main aspects of the contradiction have been transformed again. The rear water outlet structure has become more advantageous and less disadvantageous, and you can no longer cling to the original view. Some people say, isn't rear water outlet - front water outlet - rear water outlet a detour? In fact, the form is repeated, but the content is different. After this "zigzag" road, they became more conscious. Returning to the rear water outlet structure, you can combine the advantages of the two structures to achieve a higher synthesis. Without going through this process, it is impossible for understanding to reach this higher stage all at once.
    Specific analysis of specific things is the living soul of Marxism-Leninism and the scalpel for solving all problems. The reason why they were able to solve a series of specific key problems in the trial production process relatively smoothly is because they correctly used this scalpel to treat different problems differently and to look at problems comprehensively and in a developmental way.
    The trial production process of double water-cooled turbogenerators is a process of dialectics fighting against and overcoming all kinds of metaphysics.
    It is precisely because Mao Zedong Thought has taken command and there is more dialectics that the comrades of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory and Zhejiang University and other units can constantly break the shackles of various rules and regulations, jump out of the circle, dare to catch up from behind, and take their own path; that they can be liberated from various habitual forces and one-sidedness, be good at drawing wisdom from mass practice, and skillfully bypass all the reefs on the route. Their experience once again shows that to achieve major achievements in science and technology quickly, economically, and well, the broad masses of workers and technicians must not only realize political revolutionization and be politically and ideologically red, but also realize the revolutionization of thinking methods and be armed with materialist dialectics to achieve ideological and methodological redness.
    Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary dialectics are revolutionary theories. To carry out revolution, whether it is social revolution, cultural revolution, or technological revolution, you cannot be without the guidance of revolutionary theory. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, you can fully understand the laws of objective things and fully mobilize people's subjective initiative. Mao Zedong Thought can not only make people brave, dare to make revolution, and dare to win; it can also make people smart, good at using their brains, thinking of ways, and good at fighting.

　　辩证法教人聪明
　　——从双水内冷汽轮发电机试制工作中得到的启示
　　丁效润
    我国工人和科学研究人员、技术人员，在党的领导下，通过社会主义大协作，制造成功双水内冷汽轮发电机。这是我国电机工业发展中的重大创举，是我国科学技术的一项重大成就。这是毛泽东思想的胜利，是唯物辩证法的胜利。
    创制双水内冷汽轮发电机的成就说明，要打赢一场生产仗、科学仗，要在科学技术上取得重大成就，就得靠毛泽东思想，先打赢一场思想仗、政治仗，用辩证法战胜形而上学。有人曾经怀疑，我们并不天生比别人更聪明，怎么能够以比较差的物质技术条件，做到别人还没有做到的事情呢？实践证明，在社会主义制度下，只要运用毛泽东思想，运用辩证法这个锐利武器，就能够把广大劳动人民的聪明才智充分地解放出来，他们在实践中越来越聪明，完全能够做出别人还没有做到的事情。
　　后来居上是事物发展的普遍规律
    我国制造发电机，一直都是跟在别人后面学步。一九五八年，上海电机厂在制定发展规划的时候，迎面碰上一个问题：是跟在别人后面永远这样走下去呢，还是跳出窠臼，走自己的路？职工群众在浙江大学和其他兄弟部门的启发鼓舞下，坚决选择了后一条路。一些西方资本主义国家，从上一世纪八十年代开始制造发电机以来，越来越尖锐地碰到发电能力和电机发热之间的矛盾。一方面，生产实践要求一台电机发出更多的电；另一方面，电发多了，强大的电流通过机内的线圈产生高热，会把电机烧坏。因此，要发电机发电多，关键就是要想办法更多、更快地带走强电流产生的热量。长时期以来，发电机主要就是围绕着提高冷却技术而发展的。
    在国外，最初是用空气冷却，从铜线的外面吹风。这办法很简单。但是，因为每根铜线外面包着厚厚的绝缘层，象是人穿着皮袄搧扇子，作用不大。到一九三八年改用氢气，象是用电风扇代替了芭蕉扇，冷却效果大一些了。但是仍然要通过那件厚“皮袄”，冷却效果的提高还很有限。到一九五一年把“外冷”改为“内冷”，根本改变了冷却方式，使氢气通过空心的铜线圈里，大大提高了冷却效果。而早在三十年代，有人考虑到根本改变冷却介质，用水代替气体。水的冷却效果约为空气的五十倍，氢的十二到十五倍。如果采取水内冷，好比让电机喝冰镇汽水，可以大大提高发电能力。这对于发展更大容量的发电机，意义很大。只是水内冷技术很复杂，直到一九五六年，才出现定子水内冷（定子部分静止不动，通水问题比较简单），高速旋转的转子部分仍然是氢内冷。这就是外国所走过的漫长的道路。
    跟在别人后面走，在空冷技术基础上就只能先搞氢冷，等别人再搞出转子水内冷来，才能进到转子、定子都采用水内冷的“双水内冷”技术。
    有人认为，这是发电机发展的必由之路，是不可逾越的“常规”。我们的发展规划，即使速度上再快，也不能不先搞氢冷。在这种思想影响下，最初制定了一九六二年制成氢内冷电机的规划，后来又修改成为一九六○年达到转子氢内冷、定子水内冷。但是，广大职工群众并不满足。他们说，别人走的老路，为什么就是动不得的“常规”呢？为什么不能来一个迎头赶上、后来居上呢？今天对发电机的容量要求越来越大，搞氢冷会受到一定的限制，水冷已成为历史发展的需要。从发展的观点看，氢冷从一定意义上说，是水冷的准备，它从电机的结构、工艺等方面，为水冷准备了必要的条件。我们运用辩证法这个思想武器，就能够把别人的经验加以总结，掌握发电机发展的全部来龙去脉；就能够抓住根本方向，高屋建瓴，势如破竹，直接迈向发展的高峰。因此，职工群众强烈要求跳过氢冷，直攻双水内冷这个尖端。
    又有人说，就算跳是可能的，但是不能忘记我们自己的具体条件；我们过去模仿别人，现在刚刚学会走就想跳，是“不自量力”。讲到物质条件，我们的确比较差。然而，我们有敢于革命的精神，有创新的强烈愿望。我们的跳，也符合生产力发展的要求。只要充分发挥已有的物质条件的作用，充分利用几年来制造空冷发电机的设备、经验和技术力量，就能够跳。实际上，当时别的兄弟单位不是也以同样简陋的条件，在小电机上成功地做过试验吗？这更大大地鼓舞了电机厂的职工群众。当然，一定的物质条件是重要的。但是更重要的是人，是人的思想。毛主席说：“条件可以边做边准备。”只要有了敢于革命的精神，即使条件暂时不完备，也可以充分发挥人的主观能动作用，认识和运用客观规律，使精神转化为物质力量，使条件逐步完备起来。
    有人又担心，失败了怎么办呢？先搞氢冷，岂不是把握更大一些，更会少一些损失吗？群众对这个问题也进行了议论。既然是创新，是革命，总有成功和失败的两种可能性，不能不担一点“风险”。即使失败了，只要总结经验，接受教训，就可以为成功准备必要的条件，可以成为促进成功的积极因素。有所失，才能有所得。即使付一点“学费”，比起以后将要取得的成就，也是微不足道的。这样一分析，把问题说透了，群众的决心更大了。同时，群众也指出，对失败的可能，也要有所准备，尽可能少付一些“学费”。因此，他们确定先造一顶二的（同样大小的发电机，发电功率可以提高一倍），而不象有些人建议的那样，一下子就造一顶四的（同样大小的发电机，发电功率可以提高三倍）。先从比较简单一些的开始，成功的把握就大一些。而且利用空冷发电机的转轴试制，失败了仍然可以改制空冷的，避免重大的损失。
    后来居上是事物发展的普遍规律。后来者要“居上”，关键就在于跳，在于逾越前人经过的某些阶段。在人类社会的发展中，一些后进的资本主义国家尚且可以跳，可以超过一些先进资本主义国家，社会主义制度把社会生产力空前解放出来，当然更要跳了。革命者，就是要自觉运用这个辩证法规律，跳得更好，更快。上海电机厂的职工们想跳，想得完全正确。如果不想跳，就只好永远跟在别人屁股后面，自然也不会后来居上。这难道不是最大的“反常”吗？
    这是敢于革命的问题。只有首先解决了这个问题，才能在试验研究、设计和试制过程中，进一步解决怎样进行这个革命，怎样才能善于革命的问题。
　　试验研究、设计和试制三者密切结合
    方向确定了，怎样动手干呢？这里又存在着两种不同的作法，反映着两种不同的观点和方法。
    有人认为，创制双水内冷汽轮发电机是一件大工程，必须“按部就班”地进行：先由科学研究人员在实验室、研究室里进行研究，解决原理上的一切疑难问题；再由设计人员绘制出一套完整的施工蓝图；最后才能在车间中进行试制。三个阶段不容许任何交叉，否则就会破坏正常的秩序。
    职工群众反对这种作法。他们认为，既然是创新，没有现成资料可以依据，研究工作和设计工作就必须同试制、同生产实践密切联系起来，使试验研究、设计、试制结合起来进行；研究人员和设计人员也必须在党的统一领导下同广大工人群众密切结合起来，实行工人群众、技术人员和领导干部三结合，工厂、研究单位和学校的三结合。
    先拿试验研究来说。制造水内冷电机，一开始就碰上一系列的理论问题：在转子高速旋转所造成的巨大离心力下，水进得去吗？它能不能在转子里面正常地流通呢？会不会发生震动而破坏转子的动平衡？显然，通过试验研究取得各种必要的数据，弄清这些问题，是很重要的。否则，原理上站不住，绘制不出可靠的施工设计图来，就无法正式投入生产。因此，这里的问题，并不是要不要试验研究，而是怎样进行试验研究。如果只是从已有的理论出发，关在实验室、研究室里进行，那就只能重复某些外国人所走过的老路。他们从三十年代起就开始研究，也解决了一些问题，但是对于进水、通水、动平衡等根本问题，则一直没有彻底解决。用他们的理论不但不能帮助解决问题，反而成为阻碍解决问题的条条框框。
    群众反对这样的“研究”。他们认为，实验室的实验有它的特点。一般说来，它往往人为地创设某些特定条件，使某些过程以纯粹的形态进行，可以撇开一切无关的次要因素。在科学研究中，这无疑是很重要的。但是，它的局限性也在这里：把实际上很复杂的问题简单化了，把多因子抽象成为单因子。而创新中的每一个实际问题，都是综合性的，包含许多因素。有一些问题，光靠实验室根本解决不了，必须在车间中真刀真枪地进行试验。因此，试验研究就要同设计、特别是同试制结合进行，研究人员就要走出实验室、研究室，深入车间，参加试制。正因为这样做，参加试制双水内冷汽轮发电机的同志们，才能在很短时间内，把一些外国长期悬而未决的问题一一顺利地解决了。
    同时，这种做法使工人群众直接参加研究工作，也大大提高了研究工作的质量。工人群众是直接生产者，他们不但可以提供研究人员所缺少的丰富的实践经验，而且，他们了解了试验研究的具体要求，还可以更为自觉地进行试制，用他们的切身体验帮助解决一些原理上的问题。这样一结合，研究人员的理论知识也跟着丰满起来、活起来，成为更锐利的解决实际问题的武器。
    设计工作也是一样，也不能同试验研究、试制截然分开。有些人受到传统设计方法的影响，总想先由设计人员搞出一套完整的设计来，使设计工作“毕其功于一役”，然后交给工人按图纸制造。无奈在创新中，这是行不通的。设计，也就是进行制造的计划、方案。它本身就是以前的生产实践经验的某种总结。正象毛主席所说，“社会的人们投身于变革在某一发展阶段内的某一客观过程的实践中”，从而“造成了大体上相应于该客观过程的法则性的思想、理论、计划或方案”（《实践论》）。同样地，只有投身于制造双水内冷发电机的实践过程，才可能形成反映这个实践过程的规律性的完整设计。在第一台双水内冷发电机还没有制造出来以前，怎么可能出现这种发电机的完整设计呢？实际上，第一台蒸汽机、第一台发电机都没有完整的施工图，都是在试验和生产实践中逐步摸索出来的。如果一定要完全设计好了再试制，就要重复那些外国人的老路，就很可能象他们那样设计了许多年，还解决不了转子通水这个关键问题。职工群众反对走这条道路。他们从一张转子通水的示意草图开始，边试验，边设计，边试制，从实际出发，从无到有，从小到大，从简单到复杂，终于逐步搞出比较完整的设计来。
    有人觉得，这样又要试验研究，又要设计，又要试制，岂不头绪繁多，更费时间？其实恰好相反，大大地赢得了时间。这样做，能干的先干起来，不必等待全套图纸。而且更重要的是，试制的经验可以及时加以总结，反映到设计中去；而每一部分的设计又可以随时在试制中进行检验，及时发现问题，改正缺点，修正错误。这样进行设计，边做边改，灵活机动，比起闭门造车、出门稍有不合就得全部拆掉重来，当然更为多快好省。
    设计和试制的结合进行，从根本上促进了设计人员同工人群众的结合。要在试制过程中进行设计，设计人员就要下楼出院，深入现场，倾听工人群众的意见。工人群众参加设计，提方案，出主意，想办法，给设计工作提供了最丰富的材料，大大补充了设计人员在实际经验方面的不足。当然，工人群众所提供的实践经验往往是零碎的、朴素的，还要经过去粗取精、去伪存真的提炼过程。在这里，需要设计人员的理论知识和计算、制图等技术。但是，这也不象有些人所想的那样，设计人员就可以关门“提炼”了。实际上，从感性认识到理性认识的推移，必须经过反复不断的实践。感性认识和理性认识，只能在群众的实践基础上统一起来。在每一个技术关键上，他们都是经过群众性的“诸葛亮会”，边议论，边试验，对各种方案进行比较，取长补短，最后提炼出比较最好的设计方案来。这才是设计工作中最彻底的群众路线。
    通过试验研究、设计、试制的结合进行，制成了第一台双水内冷汽轮发电机。这是一个大胜利。但是，整个制造工程并没有就此结束。第一台，本来就带有试验性，不可能十全十美。对这个新生事物，要一“热”二“严”：既要肯定成绩，热情支持，又要正视缺点，严格要求，要在这一台发电机的实际运转中、在使用过程中继续试验研究，修正原来的设计，进行改进，并试制新的水内冷电机。这也就是说，不仅要在试制过程中采取这样的结合进行的办法，还要在使用过程中继续采取这样的办法。
    为什么要这样呢？职工们说得好，人对发电技术的认识是没有止境的，人向自然界索取电力的斗争也是没有止境的。制造第一台双水内冷发电机的实践，向人们提供了对于这种电机的最基本的认识。但是，这个认识是有局限性的。在这个实践中，电机内部有些矛盾暴露了，从而得到了解决；有些矛盾还没有暴露，也就没有得到解决。这些矛盾往往有一个由隐到显的发展过程。只有在长期的使用实践中，才能进一步暴露电机的结构、工艺、材料各方面的问题，进一步验证原理，考验性能，积累资料，从而取得更为完善的认识。只管制造，不管使用，只是关在电机厂中试制，而不肯同发电厂密切协作，在使用中继续改进，那是形而上学。他们反对了这种形而上学，不仅在厂内实行了工人群众、技术人员和领导干部的三结合，而且在厂外实行了制造单位同研究单位、使用单位的三结合，在更广泛的基础上贯彻了群众路线。双水内冷电机这个新生事物不断得到提高，也同它得以诞生一样，没有社会主义大协作，没有各个兄弟单位，特别是使用单位的大力支持，就是根本不能想象的。
    通过实践，职工群众深深体会到，试验研究、设计、试制要不要密切结合，不是一个简单的做法问题，而是要不要联系生产实践、要不要在创新中贯彻群众路线的问题。实践出智慧，群众出智慧。要把事情办得好，办得聪明，就要善于从这个取之不尽、用之不竭的智慧的源泉中汲取力量，就要按照马克思主义的认识论办事，按照辩证法办事，反对把试验研究、设计、试制各项工作互相孤立起来，把工人群众、技术人员和领导干部互相孤立起来，把制造同使用、制造单位同使用单位互相孤立起来的形而上学。辩证地看待继承和革新、学习和创造的关系
    在双水内冷发电机的设计和试制过程中，还碰到从何入手、怎样对待发电机的原有基础的问题。是把原来空冷发电机的结构完全丢开，另起炉灶，一切从头做起呢？还是在原来的基础上进行革新呢？正确的做法应当是，在创造双水内冷发电机的过程中，凡是原有技术中可以利用的东西，都暂时保持现状，加以利用，集中力量去解决创新中的根本问题，然后再来逐步解决其他比较次要的问题。
    当然，原则上大家也都承认，革新必须在原来的基础上进行，发电机的基本理论、基本结构不能一下子都变掉。但是，一到具体问题上，有些设计人员总是想趁这个机会来一番变革。他们总觉得，要创新，索性彻底地革新一下。后来，经过大家分析，觉得这种精神是好的。从战略上说，创新就是要破旧立新，推陈出新。不否定旧的，推翻旧的，新事物永远也不会出现。但是，从战术上说，又必须重视创新中的困难，尽可能缩短战线，饭一口一口地吃，路一步一步地走，把有限的力量用到刀口上。因此，他们主张在原来的基础上进行革新，反对一切从头做起的观点。
    在原来的基础上进行革新，就是不割断技术发展的历史，正确地处理继承和革新的相互关系的问题。任何新技术都是在已有的技术基础上发展起来的。要求一切皆新，过多地否定空冷发电机原有的结构，就会增加设计和试制的困难，结果不但会旷日持久，拖延时间，甚至把问题复杂化了，以致根本搞不出来。我们首先继承了空冷发电机结构中合理的因素，定子和转子两大部件中的某些基本结构、基本工艺过程，能够暂时不动的就暂时不动。这样，不仅大大减少了设计工作的工作量，减少了试制中的困难；而且可以立即动手，把能做的部件先做起来，大大地赢得了时间。所以，创新是否定，但不是全盘否定，而是一分为二的否定，是在肯定合理东西基础上的否定。割断历史，不利于新事物的诞生。
    会不会因在原来的基础上进行革新而失去创新的意义呢？不会。新东西和旧东西相区别的地方，往往并不在多，而在关键上的一两点。双水内冷发电机和原有各种发电机不同，不过在于定子和转子里通水而已。这里，主要就是解决水在定子和转子里面的正常流通问题。创新，就要狠狠抓住这些根本问题去攻，而不在于一下子就要求一切皆新。
    通水问题，具体说来，又有定子的通水问题和转子的通水问题。有的同志急于求成，想双管齐下，一举成功。大家对这两个问题作了进一步的分析。二者虽然都要革新，但也要分个主次。这里面，转子的通水问题最为复杂。水要在以每分钟三千转的高速度不停旋转着的转子中规规矩矩地流通，矛盾很大。正象工人们所说：“制造双水内冷发电机，好处是水带来的，害处也是水带来的。”难就难在这里。这就是主要矛盾。转子转得那么快，水进得去么？能在里面正常流转么？不会破坏转子的平衡么？漏得出来么？水路系统怎样安排？这些，都是这个主要矛盾的各种表现。主要矛盾解决了，通水到静止不动的定子里面去的问题，就可以迎刃而解。如果同等看待，“两个拳头打人”，就会分散力量，顾此失彼。所以，在革新过程中，要分析矛盾，抓主要矛盾。
    这里，还有一个向各行各业学习，正确处理学习和创造的相互关系的问题。有的人认为，既然是创新过程中发生的问题，就不可能找到什么相同或相似的东西。在这种思想影响下，在解决进水密封问题时，起初只是在自己厂里面搞来搞去，问题仍然得不到解决。后来，经过领导的启发，出去跑了跑，学了造船厂等单位的经验，把它们那里的密封技术移植到发电机上，问题解决得就很顺利。这就使大家意识到，囿于自己的狭隘世界，把自己孤立起来，不去了解外面的广大世界，就会抱残守缺，故步自封，陷入形而上学。相反，从别人那里认真学习，就能以人之长，补己之短。
    对于原来保留的空冷发电机的结构，也不能绝对地看待。继承下来的部分，可以暂时不动。但是，等发电机进一步发展了，对各个部分的具体要求也就有所变化，原有的结构不能完全适应于这种要求，因而也要有相适应的改变。有些人用凝固的观点看问题，似乎保留的结构可以永远原封不动，不需要进一步改革了。这也是形而上学。事实上，双水内冷发电机基本上解决了通水问题以后，为了适应通水的需要，原来保留下来的结构也在不断地改进。
    继承和革新、学习和创造的关系是辩证的。只有运用辩证法，才能符合事情本来的样子，正确处理它们的关系，正确解决继承和革新、学习和创造的问题，多快好省地进行创新。
　　一把解剖刀——具体问题具体分析
    制造水内冷电机的过程，是一场同自然界的艰巨的、复杂的斗争。要取得这场斗争的胜利，必须开动脑筋，对具体矛盾进行具体分析。
    分析矛盾，首先要分析矛盾的特殊性。拿水路密封的问题来说，一方面要求水按照规定的水路运行，一方面又不要从规定的水路中漏到外面来。这是一个矛盾，是贯串于一切水路中的矛盾。另一方面，密封问题在电机的不同部位，具体要求又有所不同。或者说，同一问题，在不同条件下有不同的特点。例如在转子内部，确是要求得很严格，硬是要做到“天衣无缝”，一滴水也不能渗出来。而在转子其他部位，情况就不一样。拿进水口来说，虽然也要求不漏水，但因为处在转子的外面，密封要求就没有转子里面那样严格。只要能满足水的供应量，可以稍微漏一点。再拿出水口来说，和进水密封要求又有不同。出水口，顾名思义，就是要水从转子里面流出去。这里的密封，不过是要求不四处飞溅，按照规定的渠道排出去就是了。但有些人起初又忽视了这个特点，只想到一个劲儿地堵，结果，水流得越是不畅，密封问题也越大。后来，经一个老师傅出点子，来个“大禹治水”，疏而不堵，密封的要求降低，问题也就比较容易地得到了解决。有人认为，这本来就是个很简单的问题，只是一时憋住了，根本谈不到什么辩证法问题。其实不然。很多事情，一经点破，就变得仿佛很简单。但是在事先，人们总是容易沿着一条路想，越想路越窄，就走进了死胡同。有了辩证法，就会帮助人们从各方面想想，多作些具体分析，少走一些弯路。
    分析矛盾，还要分析矛盾的两个侧面，进行全面的比较。在有些具体关键问题上，有些人往往只看到一面，陷入了片面性。在线圈结构形式问题上就是这样。线圈结构，可以有两种不同的形式：粗型的和细型的。它们各有其优点和缺点。哪一种结构更好？不能停留在抽象的议论上，必须在实践中对这两种结构进行比较，全面权衡利弊，趋利避害，或者利中取其大者，害中取其小者。当时也有人不是这样做，他们硬套某些文献资料，抓住一种结构形式，只见其所长，不见其所短。群众反对了这种片面地看问题的方法。他们对两种结构都进行了实验，在实践中分别采用。这样，进行了具体地分析比较，从而对二者都取得了比较完整的认识。
    比较，就是对立的统一。试用了这两种结构，粗型和细型这两个对立面，就在实践中全面展开了，并且也把它们各自的正面和反面、长处和短处，全面地展示出来。凡事不比不知道，一比，一树立对立面，谁个有利，谁个有弊，谁个利大弊小，谁个利小弊大，就一清二楚了。如果不对两种线圈结构进行全面的比较和分析，只见局部不见全体，就不能根据各台电机的具体要求，正确解决线圈的结构问题。
    分析矛盾，还要分析在不同条件下矛盾的相互转化。事物总是要在一定条件下走向自己的反面。有利和不利这一对矛盾也是这样。在一定条件下，有利的可以转化为不利；有害的可以转化为无害。在转子的出水结构问题上，群众就运用了这种分析方法，反对静止地、不变地看待某一种结构的有利和不利。
    转子出水，既可以把出水口开在电机的后半部，也可以开在前半部。一般说来，后出水，水路布局比较简单，加工也就比较方便。这是有利的一面。但是在材料的使用上，也有不合理的地方。这是不利的一面。前出水则相反，材料使用比较合理，而水路布局和加工工艺却比较复杂。哪一种更好一些？这要看具体条件。条件变了，利多害少和利少害多是可以互相转化的。在制造第一台水内冷发电机的时候，一切工作刚刚开始，百事待举，对出水结构，只要能够使用就行，免得拖延时间。这时，后出水结构利多害少。后来，经过初步实践，条件有了变化：一方面，需要进一步提高发电机的质量，提高材料使用的合理性；另一方面，在制造、加工等方面也积累了一定的经验。这时，前出水又成为利多害少了。有些人不明此理，总抱定一种结构不放，似乎一旦采用了，就要一直采用下去。他们不明白，客观情况是不断发展的，在一定条件下，事物总要走向自己的反面。思想落后于实际，不去具体分析具体的条件，就不能自觉地促进这个转化，不能站在科学技术发展的前头充当向导的工作。
    是不是还要继续转化呢？要的。水内冷发电机越造越大，水路的布局和加工又出现了新的问题；而材料的使用经过不断改进，较前更加合理了。在这种情况下，矛盾的主要方面又转化了。后出水结构又成为利多害少了，又不能死抱住原有看法不放了。有人说，后出水——前出水——后出水，岂不是走了弯路吗？其实，形式上是重复的，内容则是不同的。经过这段“之”字路，他们更加自觉了。再回到后出水结构，可以兼取两种结构之所长，达到更高的综合。不经过这个过程，认识就不可能一下子达到这个更高的阶段。
    对具体事物进行具体分析，是马克思列宁主义活的灵魂，是解决一切问题的解剖刀。他们能够比较顺利地解决试制过程中的一系列具体关键问题，就是因为正确地运用了这把解剖刀，对不同的问题加以区别对待，全面地、发展地看问题。
    双水内冷汽轮发电机的试制过程，是一个辩证法同形形色色的形而上学进行斗争并战胜它们的过程。
    正因为毛泽东思想挂了帅，辩证法比较多一些，上海电机厂和浙江大学等单位的同志们才能不断地打破各种条条、框框的束缚，跳出圈子，敢于后来居上，走自己的路；才能从各种习惯势力和片面性中解放出来，善于从群众实践中汲取智慧，巧妙地绕过航路上的一切暗礁。他们的经验再一次说明，要在科学技术上多快好省地取得重大成就，广大工人和技术人员不仅要实现政治上的革命化，要政治思想红，还要实现思想方法上的革命化，要用唯物辩证法武装起来，达到思想方法红。
    毛泽东思想，革命辩证法，是革命的理论。搞革命，不管是社会革命也好，文化革命也好，技术革命也好，都不能没有革命理论的指导。用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能够充分认识客观事物的规律，充分调动人的主观能动作用。毛泽东思想，不仅能够使人们勇敢起来，敢于革命，敢于胜利；也能够使人们聪明起来，善于动脑筋，想办法，善于斗争。
