　　You are truly my good neighbor
    In March 1958, Zhang Quansheng, a worker in the iron casting workshop, was transferred from Shanghai to the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant and lived next door to Jiao Yulu. At that time, the supply of rice in the Luoyang area was very limited. Zhang Quansheng was not used to the grain supplied there and was determined to transfer back to Shanghai. Jiao Yulu noticed that his neighbor's thinking was not right, and one day he had a heart-to-heart talk with Lao Zhang, "Lao Zhang, Luoyang is currently inferior to Shanghai in many ways. However, we should not compare it with high living standards, but rather look at the living conditions of the people across the country, that is, compare it with low standards, and then we will not have any complaints. When we engage in revolution and construction, we must not be afraid of hardship. If we are afraid of hardship, we will slowly make mistakes. We should work hard to build Luoyang into a city like Shanghai." Zhang Quansheng felt that Jiao Yulu was right, but he thought to himself: Anyway, coarse grains are never as tasty as rice. Unexpectedly, a few days later, Jiao Yulu personally brought more than twenty catties of snow-white rice from his own savings to Zhang Quansheng's room, insisting that he accept it. Zhang Quansheng was both grateful and ashamed. He tightly grasped Lao Jiao's hand and said excitedly: "Comrade Jiao Yulu, you are truly my good neighbor!"

　　你真是我的好邻居
    一九五八年三月间，铸铁车间工人张泉生由上海调到洛阳矿山机器厂，住在焦裕禄的紧隔壁。当时洛阳地区供给大米很少，张泉生吃不惯这里供应的粮食，一心想调回上海工作。焦裕禄发现邻居的思想不对头，有一天就找老张谈心，“老张啊，眼下洛阳在许多地方还不如上海。可是，我们不应该拿生活水平高的比，应该看一看全国人民的生活情况，也就是说拿低标准来比，就不会有意见了。我们干革命，搞建设，不能怕吃苦，怕吃苦，慢慢就会犯错误的。我们应该努力工作，把洛阳也建设成象上海一样的城市。”张泉生觉得焦裕禄说得对，但是心里却想：反正杂粮总没有大米好吃。没想到，事隔几天之后，焦裕禄竟把自家积存的二十多斤雪白的大米亲自送到张泉生的房间来，执意要他收下。张泉生又感激，又羞愧，他紧紧握住老焦的手，激动地说：“焦裕禄同志，你真是我的好邻居！”
