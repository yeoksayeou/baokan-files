    Hold the Helm, Don't Veer
    Last year, the Dahe'an District Supply and Marketing Cooperative launched three debates regarding the placement of political work, centering on questions such as "Is the poor completion of the plan due to too much emphasis on political work?" and "With the peak season approaching, should political work give way?" The political instructor and others did not waver, did not steer off course, and persisted in prioritizing politics, thus promoting the healthy development of business operations.
    In early May of last year, Ni Yingjie, the political instructor, and Shan Xianshu, the deputy director of the Dahe'an District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Luotian County, Hubei Province, participated in the county's financial and trade political work conference. They recognized that prioritizing politics was fundamental to doing a good job in financial and trade work. After returning, they organized employees to study Chairman Mao's writings, adhered to the "Three Main Viewpoints," and actively served agricultural production and the people's livelihood. At that time, the rural areas were in the midst of the "Double Rush" season (harvesting early rice and planting late rice), and also faced a severe drought. They actively engaged in the fight against the drought, doing everything possible to supply drought-resistant tools, and providing services at the drought-fighting sites. As a result, they were praised by the Party committee and the masses. People praised the Supply and Marketing Cooperative staff, saying, "They study Chairman Mao's works well, prioritize politics effectively, and contribute to supporting production."
              Was there too much emphasis on political work?
    However, by early July, they found that the business plan was not being completed well. When checking the reasons, some branch store directors actually said that too much emphasis had been placed on political work. Some said, "This year, we only focused on politics, and didn't grasp business." Others said, "If the business plan isn't completed, what kind of politics are we emphasizing?"
    Initially, Ni Yingjie and Shan Xianshu also thought, "Yes, even if political work is done well, it's hard to say anything if the business plan isn't completed." However, they immediately remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Political work is the lifeblood of all economic work." Prioritizing politics is a matter of principle, and cannot be wavered or steered away from. They took the Party branch as the core, organized employees to study Chairman Mao's quotations on political work, and mobilized the masses to conduct self-examinations from the bottom up, summarizing the political work of the past six months. Through study and summary, everyone realized that since strengthening political work, the ideological outlook of the employees had changed, the work was more solid than before, and the "Three Main Viewpoints" had been strengthened. At the same time, they also identified the subjective and objective reasons for the poor completion of the plan: the second quarter was the busy farming season in the rural areas, there were fewer people engaged in sideline occupations, and the output from the rural areas was also less, which naturally reflected a slow season in the commercial sector. Among the employees, some people still had fear of difficulties, the capitalist business style had not been thoroughly overcome, and the work was not proactive enough. Everyone believed that all these explained that the reason why the business plan was not completed was not because too much emphasis was placed on political work, but because prioritizing politics was not enough. In response to the above problems, they made new deployments for the work in the third quarter, further strengthening ideological and political work, and as a result, the turnover in July rose steadily. This debate subsided.
                Should political work give way?
      In August, Luotian County was expected to have a bumper harvest in agriculture, and the commercial peak season also followed. The Dahe'an Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a meeting to study the work of welcoming the peak season. At the meeting, someone proposed: "With the peak season coming, political work should give way a bit, otherwise the plan won't be completed." These comrades were using the pretext of busy business to try to squeeze out political work again.
    The Party branch committee studied Chairman Mao's article "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party." By comparing it with the reality of their own thoughts and work, everyone further realized that they must prioritize politics and cannot waver in the slightest.
    On the basis of unified understanding among the leading members of the branch, the masses were mobilized to review the achievements made since prioritizing politics, and discussions were held on the topic of "How to complete the various tasks of the peak season when there are few people, many things, and busy business." Through discussion, the employees unified their understanding. Wang Lizhong, the director of the Yejiahe branch store, said: "If business is busy and we don't focus on political work, don't study Chairman Mao's works, the more ideological problems the employees have, and the more chaotic the work becomes." The district cooperative then adopted measures based on the characteristics of the peak season work, persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works, and persisted in grasping ideological and political work.
    In the busy peak season, should we prioritize politics? This debate was also correctly resolved.
                  Was the work messed up?
    There was a director in this supply and marketing cooperative who had been away on business for a long time. After returning in September of last year, he started to complain when he saw that there was not much profit. He said: "This year's work has been messed up, the inventory has increased, the profit has decreased, what does it look like!" He also said: "It doesn't matter, let's start again now, and grasp business well."
    Faced with this situation, should they change course with the wind, or stick to principles? Comrades like Ni Yingjie stuck to principles. They reported to the district committee, and with the participation of comrades from the district committee, they held a branch committee meeting and exchanged opinions with each other. Ni Yingjie introduced the previous work situation, and also reviewed the weak links in business management. Everyone believed that although the profit was less than last year, the business direction was much clearer than in the past. The increase in inventory was because the local area was still in the drought-fighting period in September, and the inventory of drought-resistant materials accounted for half of the increase in the inventory of production materials; a batch of pesticides, green manure grass seeds, and agricultural cement urgently needed for agriculture had not yet been supplied at that time; in addition, the variety of business increased by 40% compared with the same period in 1964, all of which were urgently needed by farmers but had not been operated in the past; why did the profit decrease? Because some commodities were transferred to the grain system for operation; some unreasonable profits in 1964 were cancelled in 1965; at the same time, the price reduction of some industrial products also reduced the profit. Of course, enterprises should make profits as much as possible, but the quality of work should first be judged by whether it is beneficial to production and beneficial to the people. All this shows that it is definitely not because of prioritizing politics that the work has been messed up.
    Through this struggle, the position of political work has been further straightened. Because of adhering to placing political work at the forefront of all work, it has promoted the development of business work. By the end of the year, except for individual projects that had not completed the plan, most of them had overfulfilled it. Zhang Zhenfang, a purchasing agent at the Dahe'an store, said with personal experience: "In previous years, we emphasized targets every day, and the tasks were not completed well. This year, we did not simply emphasize grasping business targets, but grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works, improved ideological understanding, mobilized enthusiasm, and the tasks were completed very well."

    要掌舵  别转向
    大河岸区供销社去年围绕着“计划完成得不好，是不是因为政治工作抓多了？”和“旺季来了，政治工作要不要让路？”等问题，开展了三次有关政治工作摆什么位置的争论。政治指导员等没有动摇，没有转向，坚持了突出政治，促进了业务工作的健康发展。
    去年五月初，湖北省罗田县大河岸区供销社政治指导员倪英杰和副主任单显序，参加了县里召开的财贸政治工作会议，认识到突出政治是做好财贸工作的根本。回去以后，组织职工大学毛主席著作，坚持“三大观点”，积极为农业生产和人民生活服务。这时候，农村正是双抢季节，又遇大旱。他们积极投入了抗旱斗争，千方百计地供应抗旱工具，把服务工作做到抗旱工地，因而受到党委和群众的赞扬。大家称赞供销社职工“毛主席著作学得好，突出政治有成效，支援生产有功劳”。
              是不是政治工作抓多了？
    可是，到了七月初，他们发现业务计划完成得不算好。在检查原因的时候，有些分销店主任竟说是政治工作抓多了。有的说：“今年光抓了政治，业务就没有抓住。”有的说：“业务计划完不成，那算突出个啥政治？”
    开始，倪英杰和单显序也想到：“是呀，政治工作抓得再好，业务计划完不成，也是不大好说话。”可是，他们马上想起毛主席的教导：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”突出政治是个原则问题，不能动摇，不能转向。他们就以党支部为核心，组织职工学习毛主席关于政治工作的语录，发动群众自下而上地检查，总结半年来的政治工作。通过学习和总结，大家认识到，自从加强政治工作以后，职工的思想面貌变了，工作比以前扎实了，“三大观点”加强了。同时，他们也找出了计划完成不够好的主客观原因：第二季度是农村大忙季节，搞副业的人少，农村的出产也少，反映到商业部门自然是个淡季。在职工当中，有的人还有畏难情绪，资本主义经营作风没有彻底克服，工作不够主动。大家认为，所有这些说明了业务计划没有完成的原因不是政治工作抓多了，而是突出政治还不够。他们针对上述问题，对第三季度的工作做了新的部署，进一步加强了思想政治工作，结果七月份营业额节节上升。这一场争论，才平息下来。
                政治工作要不要让路？
      八月间，罗田县农业丰收在望，商业旺季也随之到来。大河岸供销社开会研究迎接旺季的工作，会上有人提出：“旺季来了，政治工作要让一下路，不然完不成计划。”这些同志是以业务繁忙为借口，又想挤掉政治工作。
    党支部委员会学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇文章，联系思想和工作的实际一对照，大家进一步认识到必须突出政治，不能有丝毫动摇。
    在支部领导成员认识统一的基础上，发动群众回顾突出政治以来所取得的成绩，并以“在人少事多，业务繁忙的情况下，如何完成旺季的各项任务”为题进行了讨论。通过讨论，职工们统一了认识。叶家河分销店主任王理中说：“如果业务忙，不抓政治工作，不学习毛主席著作，职工的思想问题就越多，工作就越乱。”区社于是根据旺季工作的特点，采取措施，坚持了毛主席著作的学习，坚持了抓思想政治工作。
    在业务繁忙的旺季里，要不要突出政治？这一场争论，又得到正确解决。
                  是不是工作搞糟了？
    这个供销社有个主任，长期因公外出，去年九月份回来以后，见赚钱不多，就议论开了。他说：“今年的工作搞得乱七八糟，库存增大了，利润减少了，象个啥样子！”还说：“不要紧，现在重新再来，好好地把业务抓一把。”
    面对这种情况，是随风转舵呢，还是坚持原则呢？倪英杰等同志坚持了原则。他们向区委作了汇报，在区委同志参加下，召开了支委会议，互相交换了意见。倪英杰介绍了前段工作情况，也检查了经营管理中的薄弱环节。大家认为，利润虽然比上年少一些，但经营方向比过去明确多了。库存增大，是因为九月间当地还处在抗旱时期，抗旱物资的库存，占生产资料库存增长额的一半；农业急需的一批农药、绿肥草籽、农用水泥，当时还没有供应下去；另外，经营品种比一九六四年同期扩大了百分之四十，都是农民迫切需要，而过去没有经营的；利润为什么降低？因为有一部分商品划归粮食系统经营；一九六四年有一部分不合理的利润，一九六五年取消了；同时，有些工业品降价等也使利润降低。企业当然要尽可能盈利，但是工作好坏，首先要看是不是对生产有利，对人民有利。这一切说明，绝不是因为突出政治，把工作搞糟了。
    通过这次斗争，政治工作的位置进一步摆正了。由于坚持把政治工作摆在一切工作的首位，促进了业务工作的开展，到年底除了个别项目没有完成计划外，大部分都超额完成了。大河岸门市部收购员张振芳以亲身体会说：“往年天天擂指标，任务还完成不好。今年没有单纯强调抓业务指标，就是抓住了学习毛主席著作，提高了思想认识，调动了积极性，任务完成得很好。”
