    100 Points is Not a Perfect Score [One-Act Play]
    Playwrights: Chen Ben, Guan Yue, Wang Gen
    Editor's Note: This is a good script. This script was recently performed by the China Children's Art Theater and was warmly welcomed by the audience.
    The education of children and young people is an extremely important issue. It is a component of the strategic issue of cultivating and creating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. On this issue, the only correct approach is to adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, adhere to the Party's educational policy, and act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on education. Whether it is solving the issue of direction or the issue of methods; whether it is solving the issue of school education or the issue of family education, there are no exceptions.
    This script timely reflects the living thoughts on this front, with vivid and lively artistic images, and has great practical educational significance.
    Time: Summer vacation.
    Location: Beijing, a miner's home.
    Characters:
    Da Zhi – Male, 15 years old, student in the second year of junior high school (Class A), member of the Communist Youth League.
    Xiao Yi – Female, 14 years old, student in the second year of junior high school (Class B). Da Zhi's younger sister, Young Pioneer.
    Xiao Mao – Male, 11 years old, student in the fifth grade, Da Zhi's younger brother, Young Pioneer.
    Father – In his fifties, section chief of a work section in the Mentougou Coal Mine, Communist Party member.
    Mother – In her forties, housewife.
    Classmate – Young Pioneer.

    (When the curtain rises, the mother is packing her things to leave for a long trip. Xiao Yi walks gracefully to the mirror, tidying her hair while humming a song. Xiao Mao sits on a small stool, fanning himself vigorously, his mouth pouting high. After a while...
    Xiao Mao: (Suddenly stands up, slams the fan on the table, shouting) Take me, take me to Grandma's house.
    Mother: Xiao Mao, you really know how to pester!
    Xiao Yi: Humph, acting like a spoiled brat. Mom said long ago, whoever gets the best grades gets to go. If you don't agree, bring out the report cards and compare!
    Xiao Mao: You just bully me. If you're so good, compare with your brother.
    Xiao Yi: Compare if you want! (Enters the inner room)
    Xiao Mao: Fine! You wait! (Angrily pulls open the drawer, moves books, rummaging everywhere)
    Mother: What are you messing around with again?
    Xiao Mao: Looking for my brother's report card! (Says as he walks into the inner room.)
    Xiao Yi: (Comes out from the inner room) You're just looking for nothing, wasting your effort! (Turns to her mother) Mom, is it okay if I wear this outfit?
    Mother: Xiao Yi, don't get too carried away. Are you sure your score is better than your brother's?
    Xiao Yi: Humph, let me tell you, my brother doesn't even dare to take out his report card this time.
    Mother: What? Really? ... What happened to this child this time?
    Xiao Yi: Yeah, he usually works so hard, but he did so badly on the final exam. I feel sorry for him.
    Mother: Xiao Yi, when your father comes back later, don't let him know about this. (Seeing Xiao Yi doesn't care) Your father's work is so heavy at the section, and today is a labor day to go down the mine to work, so don't let him get distracted. If he gets angry, you can forget about going to Grandma's house! Come on, give me your brother's report card!
    Xiao Yi: No, I'll just keep it here! When he criticizes me again for "not being able to study consciously and proactively," for "not being able to demand high standards of myself," I'll just take this out and see what he says!
    Mother: You little girl, last night we were studying together, didn't Chairman Mao say that revolutionary comrades...
    Xiao Yi: (Quickly continues) Should help each other, Mom, how could you forget? (Dong! - The clock strikes half past. The mother points to the inner room)
    Mother: Hurry up and tidy up! When your father comes back, let him take us to the train. (Xiao Yi enters the inner room. At the same time, Xiao Mao pouts and comes out of the inner room. He obviously didn't find his brother's report card.)
    Xiao Yi: Xiao Mao... (Xiao Mao ignores Xiao Yi and goes into the inner room)
    Mother: (Consolingly) Xiao Mao, listen to me, next year you work hard and get a hundred points, and Mom will take you there (Xiao Mao twists his shoulder forcefully and walks away. The mother glares at Xiao Mao and walks into the inner room.
    Xiao Mao: (Shouts to the inner room) If you don't let me go, I'll go find my brother. You can't leave until my brother comes back! (Xiao Mao walks sullenly towards the door, but just then the door is pushed open with a "whoosh" sound, and Da Zhi runs in quickly.)
    Da Zhi: (Waving the evening paper in his hand) Good news! Resolutely support the black people's struggle, oppose racial discrimination, Chairman Mao has issued a statement!
    Xiao Mao: I know that. Brother, hurry up and take out your report card!
    (Da Zhi instinctively covers his pocket, but Xiao Mao's hand is faster, taking the report card out of his brother's pocket, Da Zhi snatches it back.
    Da Zhi: This, this isn't my report card, I don't have such high grades!
    Xiao Mao: Then where's yours? Give it to me!
    Da Zhi: What do you want my report card for?
    (Seeing Xiao Mao about to open his mouth, he quickly stops him with his hand) Wait, let me analyze it. What do you want my report card for.
    Xiao Mao: (Impatiently) Still analyzing, by the time you're done analyzing, they'll be on the train. Brother, have you forgotten? (Seeing Da Zhi still doesn't understand) Didn't Mom say a long time ago, whoever gets the best grades gets to go to Grandma's house this time! Quickly take out your report card and compare it with sister's!
    Da Zhi: Oh, Xiao Yi is back?
    Xiao Mao: Uh-huh!
    Da Zhi: Really?
    Xiao Mao: (Pointing to the inner room) She's packing with Mom! The train tickets are already bought.
    Da Zhi: What?
    Xiao Mao: The train tickets are already bought, and Mom has written a letter to Uncle, asking him to pick us up at the station!
    Da Zhi: Ah, so she's going to Grandma's house... That's bad!
    Xiao Mao: What's wrong?
    Da Zhi: If she leaves, we can't do the living newspaper drama at tomorrow's parade!
    Xiao Mao: Parade? Isn't your school not having a parade?
    Da Zhi: Who said that? Today, the students were so excited after reading Chairman Mao's statement supporting the black people's struggle. Some are writing slogans, some are making flags, we're rehearsing the drama over here, practicing singing over there, the whole school is mobilized! Xiao Yi is playing the main role in the living newspaper drama!
    Xiao Mao: (Claps his hands, jumping up) Oh no! Brother, sister is telling Mom lies.
    Da Zhi: What did she say?
    Xiao Mao: As soon as she came in, Mom said, "If you're having a parade tomorrow, I'll return that train ticket and go alone." Sister said, "Ah? Parade... um, school's out for summer vacation, ... so, there won't be a parade."
    Da Zhi: Really?
    Xiao Mao: Uh-huh, I'll go tell her! (Xiao Mao runs angrily to the inner room, Da Zhi stops him)
    Da Zhi: Didn't you say that we should fight against bad phenomena?
    Da Zhi: But if you force her to stay, she won't realize the significance of this parade, it's useless.
    Xiao Mao: Right! Mom is biased, always doting on her, when Dad comes back, we'll tell Dad.
    Da Zhi: No, don't tell Dad either. We'll solve this ourselves.
    Xiao Mao: Ourselves?
    Da Zhi: Have you forgotten what I told you a few days ago?
    Xiao Mao: What?
    Da Zhi: What Chairman Mao said, think again....
    Xiao Mao: (Touching his neck) What Chairman Mao said,...
    Da Zhi: Didn't Chairman Mao ask us to strengthen our ability to analyze problems...
    Xiao Mao: And solve problems?
    Da Zhi: Isn't this a good opportunity for us to exercise ourselves?
    Xiao Mao: Hmm. But sister she...
    Da Zhi: Lost confidence again?
    Xiao Mao: Okay then!
    Da Zhi: Agreed!
    Xiao Mao: Agreed!... But what if she insists on leaving?... (Suddenly slaps his thigh) I have a good idea, guaranteed she won't be able to leave, isn't she going to compare scores!...
    (At this time, the mother and Xiao Yi come out from the inner room.
    Da Zhi: Mom!
    Mother: Da Zhi, your scores this time... (Seeing Xiao Mao and Xiao Yi beside her, she doesn't continue) Go, you two, go see if your father has come back!
    Xiao Yi: Mom, let's go to the train station, we can't wait for Dad.
    Xiao Mao: No, you can't leave!
    Mother: Xiao Mao, be good!
    (Mother and Xiao Yi are about to say something, Xiao Mao hurriedly stops them with gestures, rushes over to take the schoolbag off the wall, and stands in the middle of the room.
    Xiao Mao: (Solemnly to his mother) Whoever gets good scores gets to go back to Grandma's house, Mom, did you say that or not! (Turns to Xiao Yi) Hey, if your scores aren't as good as brother's, you have to stay automatically!
    Xiao Yi: Of course!
    ("Pa" sound, Xiao Mao pulls out a report card from his schoolbag and slams it on the table.
    Xiao Mao: I can't go, I admit it!
    (Another "pa" sound, Xiao Yi also slams a report card on the table.
    Xiao Mao: Brother, it's just your turn.
    Da Zhi: Xiao Mao, this isn't good.
    Mother: Xiao Yi, what did I say to you just now? Quickly put away the report card, your father will be back soon!
    Xiao Mao: What's there to be afraid of when Dad comes back? It's just right, let Dad see it!
    ("See what?" With the sound of the voice, the door opens, and the father appears at the door.
    Xiao Mao: (Running over) Dad! You came just in time, quickly be our judge!
    Mother: Xiao Mao, don't be silly! Your father just came back from the mine, let him rest for a while!
    (Mother says as she gestures to Xiao Yi to put away the report card, but at this time the father has already walked to the table and sat down.
    Father: Hey, have you heard, tomorrow there will be a parade to support the black people's struggle and oppose American imperialism! Our mine is also participating, will your school also participate?
    Mother: Isn't school on vacation from today? If they have a parade, I won't buy the train tickets. See, I'm taking Xiao Yi now.
    Xiao Mao: (Finally can't hold it in) Shouldn't have taken sister!
    Father: Ho, what's going on? The conflict is pretty sharp!
    Xiao Mao: Dad, this is a matter of principle! Sister she...
    (Da Zhi stops Xiao Mao, explaining to Xiao Mao in a low voice, and hinting "agreed."
    Xiao Yi: Mom, Dad isn't looking at our report cards?
    Mother: (Gives Xiao Yi a white look) What else is there to see! If I said I'd take you, I'll take you, okay?
    (To Father) I promised them earlier, whoever gets good grades, I'll take them to Grandma's house.
    Father: (Relaxed) I don't agree with your approach, (to the children) do you agree with your mom's opinion?
    Xiao Mao: Only my brother doesn't agree.
    Father: Oh? (Looks at Da Zhi with satisfaction and nods. To Xiao Mao) Why doesn't your brother agree? Is it because he doesn't study well?
    Xiao Mao: No! Dad, don't you know, brother is a hard-working king, this time he must have gotten a hundred in every subject again!
    Father: Hmm, yourself?
    Xiao Mao: (Lowers his head) I...I...
    Father: Da Zhi, have you seen their report cards?
    Da Zhi: Not yet.
    Father: Da Zhi, as an older brother, you should often care about their progress and learning. You are a member of the Communist Youth League, and they are all Young Pioneers. You have this right and this obligation. (Walks to the washbasin stand, washes his face) You look at their report cards first, combine them with their usual performance, and talk about your opinion. (Da Zhi walks to the table, about to pick up the report card...
    Xiao Yi: I don't agree. If you want to look, look at all three.
    Mother: Xiao Yi! I say Xiao Yi's father! It's not early, leaving on a trip, it's better to be early than late, don't miss the train!
    Father: (Washing his face and walking back) Isn't the train at six thirty? (Takes out his old pocket watch) There's still time.
    Da Zhi: Dad, you should look at them. (Mother finds a teapot, Xiao Yi pours tea for Father)
    Father: (Sitting in the chair, seeing the report cards on the table) Ho, the report cards are all set out. (Picks up one casually, but doesn't have his glasses) Xiao Mao, read yours first. (Xiao Mao reluctantly takes the report card.
    Xiao Mao: (Reads) "Chinese seventy...
    Father: No, first read your conduct comments.
    Xiao Mao: (Reads) "Loves labor, willing to do good deeds for the collective, enthusiastic in helping classmates..."
    (Da Zhi hands the glasses to Father from the side.
    Father: Not bad! Let me see. (Puts on his glasses) Hmm, there's improvement. Xiao Mao, to see if a person is good or bad, you must first look at this, (points to his head) this is the engine, you say right? (Turns a page) Eighty, eighty-three, ... eighty...
    Xiao Mao: Eighty-nine!
    Father: Eighty-nine! Eighty-nine! (Looks down) Sixty-one.
    Xiao Mao: I'm not interested in nature!
    Father: Not interested? Hmm, (to Da Zhi, Xiao Yi) You say, how can you be interested?
    Xiao Yi: Of course he's not interested if he always gets sixty or seventy points. You have to work hard and get over eighty, then you'll get more and more energetic!
    Father: Oh? (To Da Zhi) You say?
    Da Zhi: (Thinks) Xiao Mao, what is there in the ground?
    Xiao Mao: Coal.
    Da Zhi: Right, Dad often says that coal is black gold, is the grain of industry, our life can not be without it.
    Xiao Mao: Right, if there is no coal, we can't cook or boil water.
    Da Zhi: Right, then what else is there in the ground?
    Xiao Mao: (Confused) Soil, what else?
    Da Zhi: If you could turn soil into big steamed buns, turn soil into the clothes you wear, turn soil into the rubber shoes on your feet, would you be interested?
    Xiao Mao: Wouldn't that be like doing magic? I love watching that.
    Da Zhi: Then the wheat for making steamed buns, the cotton for making clothes, the rubber for making rubber shoes, aren't they all grown from the ground? Isn't learning nature learning these common sense things?
    Xiao Mao: Right! (Touches the back of his head, full of interest) Now that you mention it, it is interesting!
    Father: If you personally participate in the labor of turning soil into steamed buns, participate in the labor of digging coal, it will be even more interesting. Xiao Mao, judging from your grades, there is still progress, but basic knowledge is not yet solid, you must study hard!
    (Xiao Mao nods)
    Mother: Xiao Yi isn't weak this time, two subjects eighty, one subject ninety, two subjects one hundred!
    Father: (To Xiao Yi) Is that so, the grades aren't low! Bring it, I'll look at your conduct comments.
    (Takes the report card, turns it over, looks carefully, frowns, reads) Loves labor, obeys discipline, completes assignments well, excellent academic performance. Xiao Yi, didn't the teacher say you have any shortcomings?
    Xiao Yi: The teacher didn't say.
    Xiao Mao: Sister always likes to compare scores with classmates.
    Xiao Yi: What's wrong with that? Our Teacher Wang said we should get high scores, he also said: If you get over ninety in every subject, I guarantee you can get into school...
    Father: Didn't the teacher tell you to have a red heart and be prepared for anything? (Xiao Yi doesn't speak) (Slowly puts down the report card)
    Father: Xiao Yi, you want to go to Grandma's house?
    (Xiao Yi nods.
    Father: (Takes off his glasses, puts them in his upper pocket) Okay then, I agree to let you go. (To Da Zhi, Xiao Mao) What are your opinions?
    Xiao Mao: I don't agree! Dad.
    Da Zhi: Dad, I want to talk to Xiao Yi privately.
    Xiao Yi: No need!
    Father: (Explaining to Da Zhi, Xiao Mao) I let her go, not because she got high scores, but because... (Turns to Xiao Yi) You can go, but I have a request for you.
    Xiao Yi: Tell me, any request is fine!
    Father: Just one: when you get to the countryside, you must work in the fields every day, and you must think about what the vast members of the People's Commune are working hard for, and what you are going to school for, write a reflection, and come back and show it to me.
    Xiao Yi: Hmm.
    Mother: (A weight is lifted, to Xiao Yi) It's not early, hurry up and tidy up in the inner room! (Mother and Xiao Yi go into the inner room)
    Xiao Mao: (Anxiously) Brother, why don't you say anything?
    (A classmate shouts "Da Zhi!" "Da Zhi!" runs up.
    Classmate: Da Zhi, have you found Xiao Yi?
    Xiao Mao: She's going to Grandma's house with Mom.
    Classmate: What can we do? The parade is tomorrow morning, and it's too late to replace her now!
    Da Zhi: Tell the students, I will definitely mobilize her to stay.
    Classmate: Then we'll wait for her at school.
    (Leaves)
    Da Zhi: Okay.
    (Xiao Yi, Mother, Father carrying net bags and other items come out from the inner room.
    Da Zhi: Xiao Yi, your classmates came to find you again.
    Xiao Mao: They said... (Da Zhi stops him)
    (Xiao Yi's face turns red, wants to say something, but doesn't open her mouth.
    Da Zhi: I told him you'd be there in a while.
    Mother: What? It's time to go to the station!
    Father: Do you have something important?
    Mother: What is it? Can't you talk about it when you come back?
    Xiao Mao: It'll be too late to talk about it when we get back!
    Mother: Then let your brother do it for her first.
    (About to leave)
    Da Zhi: I, I'm not a girl! Xiao Yi, come here, let me talk to you...
    Xiao Yi: What is there to say? Are you looking for your report card? It's with me!
    Mother: (Stopping her) Xiao Yi! The train is about to leave!
    (Xiao Yi picks up the net bag.
    Xiao Mao: Oppose lying!
    Da Zhi: (Stopping him) Xiao Mao!
    Father: What exactly is going on with you?
    Xiao Mao: Shouldn't have taken her!
    Xiao Yi: Why?
    Xiao Mao: Because you... (Da Zhi makes a 'agreed' gesture stopping him) You don't even know yourself!
    Xiao Yi: Of course I know, whoever gets good grades gets to go!
    Father: Hmm? (This sentence obviously stimulated the father, but he patiently listened.)
    Xiao Mao: Just based on grades, it's not your turn! (To Xiao Yi) Your grades compared to brother's are still this! (Waving his little finger)
    Xiao Yi: (Pouts her lips)
    Xiao Mao: Don't pout! If you're so good, you compare with brother!
    Xiao Yi: Compare if you want! (Glares at Da Zhi, about to take out her report card)
    Mother: (Rebuking again, begging again) Xiao Yi! (Threateningly) The train is leaving soon!
    Father: (Carefully observing all of this) Not in a hurry, there's time.
    Xiao Mao: Don't you dare to compare, right?!
    Da Zhi: Xiao Mao! Sister, listen to me...
    Xiao Yi: No need to say, isn't it comparing grades? (Takes out the report card from her pocket) Mine, Dad has seen it, this is yours! (Throws the report card on the table)
    (Silence. Xiao Yi realizes that this is wrong, hurriedly covers the report card with her hand) This isn't...
    Xiao Mao: (Runs over, hurriedly picks up the report card, turns it over) Zhou Da Zhi of Class A, Second Year of Junior High School - Whose is this if not brother's! (Turns a page) You listen (His mouth opens, but the voice seems to be stuck; nothing comes out.)
    Father: What's going on? Bring it here, let me see.
    (Silence. Xiao Mao hands the report card to Father... Da Zhi lowers his head, Mother frowns, Xiao Mao stares... The grandfather clock "Dong, Dong,..." strikes five times.
    Father: Xiao Yi, Xiao Mao, you go to the inner room.
    (Xiao Yi doesn't move, Xiao Mao goes into the inner room, doesn't close the door, stands at the doorway looking out.)
    Father: (Gently) Da Zhi, why did you do badly on the exam, is there a reason?
    Da Zhi: No.
    Mother: Last month at the parent-teacher conference, the teacher told me that our Da Zhi is studying very well! Everyone praised him as a good student.
    Father: Is this your comment? (Da Zhi nods) "... Unable to actively fight against some incorrect ideas," also "unable to patiently help comrades," hmm? (Points to the report card again) Is this your grade?
    Da Zhi: Yes. Dad, I didn't study well.
    (Silence.
    Father: How many days have you been in the Youth League?
    Da Zhi: (Thinks) Six months and three days.
    Father: Then why are you worse than before after joining the Youth League?
    Da Zhi: ...
    Father: Do you remember what I said to you on the morning of your Youth League oath? That's not just a father's request to his son, it's more importantly a veteran's request to a new soldier, a Communist Party member's request to a member of the Communist Youth League, but you... (Xiao Mao suddenly runs out, standing in front of Father.
    Xiao Mao: Dad! Dad! I guarantee that after joining the Youth League, brother demands more of himself than before. You don't believe me... That's right! (Runs to the inner room, hugs over two piles of notebooks and a piece of ore) Look, these are the notes brother wrote after reading Chairman Mao's books; these are the extracurricular math problems brother did, and brother often participates in the mine's labor on Sundays, look, this is the ore he brought back for specimen use.
    (Father flips through these notebooks.
    Xiao Mao: Don't look at the fact that my brother's grades are lower than sister's, but I guarantee he is learning better than sister. (Suddenly slaps his thigh) Got it. Dad, can I give you an idea?
    Mother: All your ideas are bad ideas.
    Father: (To Mother) Let him speak.
    Xiao Mao: You just have an on-the-spot exam. Right, an on-the-spot martial arts contest! (Jumping and skipping to Father) Do you think that's good?
    Father: Good, good, right! (Walks over) Da Zhi, Xiao Yi, how about I test you again?
    Mother: Oh! What else is there to test? I see that you're going to invalidate those two train tickets!
    Xiao Yi: Mom, let Dad test us! (Muttering to herself, but also seemingly deliberately saying it for others to hear) Anyway, the scores on my report card aren't written by myself!
    Mother: What's wrong with you today...
    Father: Don't say anything, I'm determined to check this quality today!
    Xiao Mao: Mom, (Pushes Mom into the inner room)
    Mother: Ah! (Walking into the inner room, while muttering) I can't do anything with you. (Mother enters the room. Xiao Mao quietly arranges three stools.
    Xiao Mao: (Clapping his hands happily) Yay, exam time, exam time! Quickly enter the classroom (Puts down the small stools, raises his hand, making a ringing motion, walking and shouting) Ding-dong, ding-dong, Dad (Points to the middle chair indicating Dad to sit down), brother. (Pulls Da Zhi over to sit down) (Xiao Yi, Da Zhi sit on both sides of the father, Xiao Mao stands behind his brother.)
    Father: (Clears his throat, solemnly) First question, what conditions should a proletarian successor possess?
    Xiao Yi: Let me say (stands up). There are five conditions. (Strikes the pose of reciting a book, with the rhythm of a machine gun) First, they must be true Marxists-Leninists. Second, they must be revolutionaries who serve the vast majority of the Chinese and the world wholeheartedly. Third, they must be proletarian politicians who are able to unite the vast majority of people to work together. Not only must they unite with people who agree with them, but they must also be good at uniting those who disagree with them, and also...
    Father: Good, good, you recite very fluently!
    Xiao Yi: (Looking at Da Zhi triumphantly) I estimated that this question would definitely be on the exam, I even copied it twice myself! (Sits down)
    Father: Then tell me, which of these five is the most important?
    Xiao Yi: The teacher said the second one.
    Father: Then tell me about it.
    Xiao Yi: The teacher said the first one is the theory, the direction, the second one is the purpose, and the third, fourth, and fifth are the methods.
    Father: Right, then why is the second one the most important?
    Xiao Yi: The teacher didn't say, whatever Teacher Wang said, we just answer how he said it... If you ask like you, it will never end.
    Father: Da Zhi, you say.
    Da Zhi: After the teacher finished speaking, I thought, if there is no second one, then the first one becomes empty talk; the third, fourth, and fifth are impossible to do. So, I think serving the vast majority of the people of China and the world wholeheartedly is the most fundamental and most important.
    Xiao Yi: This is your own interpretation again!
    Da Zhi: No, think about it, the articles of Chairman Mao that we learn, whether they are learned in politics class, or learned in language class, or self-study, almost every one says that we should serve the broad masses of people. Right, (takes out a small notebook and opens it) You listen to this sentence of Chairman Mao: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people, and everything we do is to serve the people..." Today, we strive to learn knowledge, isn't it for the purpose of serving the people better tomorrow?
    Father: (Nodding constantly) Good, good! You understand it more deeply, you answered well.
    (Xiao Mao goes around from behind the father, about to make a face at Xiao Yi, sees Xiao Yi is sneering.
    Xiao Mao: Dad! Look, sister is pouting again! (To Xiao Yi) What an attitude!
    Xiao Yi: (To Father) Anyway, this question you asked, it's not in the textbook, or in the notes that the teacher copied. (Picks up the schoolbag and hands it to Father) If you don't believe me, check it.
    Father: You ah... (Casually picks up a book, flips through a few pages) Okay, I'll ask you from the book, "Why do we add a small amount of grit to poultry feed?"
    Xiao Yi: Yo! You're asking from the "Animals" textbook! (Smilingly says) Don't you know! "Animals," "History," and "Physics" are all subjects we learn but don't test on!
    Father: Not testing doesn't mean we can not know. Da Zhi, you say, how does the book explain this question?
    Da Zhi: ... The book says... (Xiao Mao's eyes are wide as he looks at his brother, subconsciously fanning his brother.
    Da Zhi: Right! (Runs to the desk, opens the drawer, takes out a small box) You look.
    Xiao Mao: Yo, isn't this chicken poop?
    Da Zhi: Yes, when the teacher explained this question, I didn't quite believe it, so I did an experiment... I locked up our family's hen, rooster, and small hen, not letting them eat any grit, and paid attention to observing their poop. In the beginning, it was nothing, but later, undigested grains were found in the chicken poop. This proves that what the textbook says is correct. Right, the book says that grit has the effect of grinding feed and helping digestion in poultry.
    (Father nods appreciatively.
    Xiao Yi: You only ask these questions that aren't recorded on the report card at all.
    Father: (Quite dissatisfied) Xiao Yi! (Pauses) Children, the Party and the state run schools to let you learn knowledge and skills, so that you can do revolution well in the future, and take over our old generation's class. Going to school is not to cope with exams, let alone let you go home to carry scores. You ah, there's still a lot of oil and grime in your head... After you come back from Grandma's house, after seeing your reflection, I will have a good talk with you. (To Da Zhi) Da Zhi, you like to use your brain, analyze problems, and learn knowledge lively, these are all very good. But Da Zhi, you must remember that learning knowledge must be done step by step, especially in the primary and secondary school stages, which is the time to lay the foundation, you have to build it brick by brick, without any sloppiness! Look, you only got seventy-five points in geometry, can you say that you have learned your basic knowledge well?
    Da Zhi: Right, Dad, I will definitely remember your words. My studies are not good.
    (Father nods. The mother, carrying a pot and holding a bowl, has been standing at the doorway listening for a long time, and at this time, she finally breathes a sigh of relief.
    Mother: That's right! All said and done, I'm still to blame. You work at the section, I didn't take on the responsibility of managing the children. But, then again, our children are all pretty good, Xiao Yi may be rigid-minded, but she remembers basic knowledge firmly; Da Zhi, although his score is a bit worse this time, all his previous courses were above ninety points. Okay, it's not early, you drink a bowl of cold boiled water to relieve the fire, and then take us to the station!
    (Saying, she pours a bowl of water and hands it to Father, and then picks up the net bag, etc. and hands it to Xiao Yi)
    (Father finishes drinking the water, Xiao Yi walks towards the door with Father, Mother follows behind.
    Da Zhi: (Sits down, then stands up again) Wait a minute!
    (Everyone is astonished.
    Mother: You, what are you doing again?
    Da Zhi: Mom... (Looks at Xiao Yi) Sister, you come here...
    Father: (Sternly) Da Zhi, what exactly is it?
    Da Zhi: Dad... Xiao Yi... she should stay.
    Xiao Yi: Okay, I'll stay, you go! (Throws things on the ground)
    Xiao Mao: (Anxious and angry, shouting at Xiao Yi) Shameless!
    (Shouting a slogan) Resolutely oppose lying!
    Xiao Yi: I lied? Humph! (Points to the table) Even this...
    Xiao Mao: Even what? Even what? Don't be a deadbeat!
    Xiao Yi: (Extremely angry) Even this report card with seventy-something points is fake.
    (Father walks step by step to the table, slowly picks up the report card, puts on his glasses.
    Xiao Yi: There's no school seal on it at all! There's no principal's stamp, no dean of teaching's stamp, not even the homeroom teacher's stamp! That handwriting, it's all written by himself!
    Father: Da Zhi... you... you... you did such a thing!
    Da Zhi: Dad, this is indeed my grade.
    Father: What?
    Da Zhi: This is my real grade.
    (Father suddenly walks to the table, raising his fist to strike, then puts it down.
    Mother: (To Da Zhi) You, you... look, you made your father angry! Hurry up and tell the truth!
    Da Zhi: Dad! (Rushes over) I'll tell you, I'll tell you everything.
    (Mother wrings a cold hand towel and hands it to Father.
    Da Zhi: (Not knowing where to start) Last semester, just three days after I joined the League...
    (Father drinks a sip of water, the clock ticks and tocks) Comrade Li Xian, the secretary of the League district committee, held a meeting with several newly admitted League members at our school. He asked us, "You often say that the burden we will shoulder is heavy, can you talk about how heavy this burden is?" Everyone looked at me, and I looked at you, no one could answer. Comrade Li Xian seemed very excited, and asked us again, "Can you hear the sound of shackles coming from Taiwan prisons? Can you hear the crying of children in South Vietnamese concentration camps? Can you hear the sound of whips being drawn on the people of the Congo? Can you hear the sound of machine guns from the

    100分不算满分〔独幕话剧〕
    编剧：陈奔　关越　王亘
    编者按：这是一个好剧本。这个剧本最近由中国儿童艺术剧院上演，受到了观众的热烈欢迎。
    少年儿童的教育问题，是个极端重要的问题，是培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人这个战略性问题中的一个组成部分。在这个问题上，唯一正确的做法是：坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，坚持党的教育方针，按照毛主席对教育工作的指示办事。不论是解决方向问题，或者解决方法问题；不论是解决学校教育问题，或者解决家庭教育问题，无一例外地都必须如此。
    这个剧本及时反映了当前在这条战线上的活思想，艺术形象鲜明生动，很有现实教育意义。
    时间：暑假。
    地点：北京，一个矿工的家里。人物：
    大志——男，十五岁，初二（甲班）学生，共青团员。
    小宜——女，十四岁，初二（乙班）学生。大志的妹妹，少先队员。
    小毛——男，十一岁，五年级学生，大志的弟弟，少先队员。
    父亲——五十来岁，门头沟煤矿，某工段段长，共产党员。
    母亲——四十多岁，家庭妇女。
    同学——少先队员。
    （幕启时，母亲正在收拾东西准备出远门。小宜轻盈地走到镜子前，一边整理着头发，一边哼起歌儿来。小毛坐在小板凳上使劲地扇着扇子，嘴噘得老高。过了一会儿……小毛：（猛地站起来，把扇子拍在桌上，喊着）带我去，带我上姥姥家去。
    母亲：小毛，你可真能磨人！小宜：哼，耍赖皮，妈早就说了，谁考的成绩好，就带谁去，不服气，就把记分册拿来比呀！小毛：你就会欺侮我，你有能耐跟哥哥比。
    小宜：比就比！（进里屋）
    小毛：好！你等着！（赌气地拉开抽屉，搬开书，到处翻着）
    母亲：你又瞎折腾什么？
    小毛：找我哥哥的记分册！（一边说着一边走进里屋。）
    小宜：（从里屋出来）你甭瞎翻了，白费劲！（转对母亲）妈，我就穿这身去好不好？
    母亲：小宜，可别乐过了劲，你考的分数就准保赶过你哥哥了？
    小宜：哼，跟您说吧，我哥哥这回连记分册也不敢往外拿了。
    母亲：怎么了？
    小宜：他考砸了！
    母亲：（万没想到）是吗？你怎么知道的？
    小宜：哼！（从书包中掏出一本记分册）您看，这就是他的记分册，就这上边的也不过是七十来分。
    母亲：怎么？真的？……这孩子，这回是怎么了？
    小宜：是呀，平时那么用功，期末考得这么糟，我也替他怪可惜的。
    母亲：小宜呀，待会你爸爸回来，这事可千万别让他知道。（见小宜不以为然）你爸爸在段上工作那么重，今天又是劳动日下井干活去了，你就别让他分心啦，他要是生了气，你也就甭打算上姥姥家了！来，把哥哥的记分册给我！
    小宜：甭，就放在我这儿吧！等他再批评我什么“不能自觉主动地学习啦”，什么“不能用高标准要求自己啦”，我就把这个拿出来，看他还说什么！
    母亲：你这个丫头，昨儿晚上咱一块儿学习，毛主席不是说革命同志……
    小宜：（紧接说）要互相帮助，妈妈你怎么忘了。（当！——时钟敲了半点。母亲指里屋）
    母亲：快去拾掇拾掇吧！你爸爸一回来，就让他送咱们上火车了。（小宜进里屋。与此同时小毛噘着嘴从里屋出来。他显然是没有找到哥哥的记分册。
    小宜：小毛……（小毛没理小宜进里屋去了）
    母亲：（安慰地）小毛，听我说，明年你使把劲考个一百分，妈妈就带你去（小毛使劲一扭膀子，走开。母亲瞪了小毛一眼，走进里屋。
    小毛：（冲里屋喊）不让我去，我找我哥哥去，我哥哥没回来以前，你们可不能走呀！（小毛悻悻地向门口走去，谁知就在这时门“呼”的一声被推开了，大志匆匆地跑了进来。
    大志：（晃着手中的晚报）好消息！坚决支持黑人斗争，反对种族歧视，毛主席发表声明了！
    小毛：我知道了。哥哥快把你的记分册拿出来！
    （大志下意识地一捂口袋，那知小毛的手更快，早从哥哥口袋中把记分册抽出来，大志夺回。
    大志：这，这不是我的记分册，我哪有这么高的成绩呀！
    小毛：那你的呢？快给我！
    大志：你要我的记分册干什么？
  （见小毛刚要张口，忙用手制止）别忙，让我分析分析。你要我的记分册干什么。
    小毛：（迫不及待的）还分析呢，再分析人家就上火车了。哥哥，你忘了？（见大志仍不解）妈不是早就说了嘛，这回谁考得好就带谁上姥姥家！快把你的记分册拿出来跟姐姐比比去！
    大志：噢，小宜回家来啦？
    小毛：唔！
    大志：真的呀？
    小毛：（指里屋）正跟妈整理东西呢！火车票都买好了。
    大志：什么？
    小毛：火车票都买好了，妈还给舅舅写了信，让舅舅到车站去接哪！
    大志：啊，原来她是要上姥姥家呀……坏了！
    小毛：怎么啦？
    大志：她一走，明天游行，活报剧就出不了啦！
    小毛：游行？你们学校不是不游行吗？
    大志：谁说的？今天同学们看了毛主席支持黑人斗争的声明可激动了，写标语的写标语，做旗子的做旗子，这边排剧，那边练唱歌，我们全校都动起来了！小宜还在活报剧里演主要角色哪！
    小毛：（两手一拍，猛的跳起来）哎呀！哥哥，姐姐跟妈说瞎话了。
    大志：她说什么？
    小毛：刚才她一进门妈就说：“你们明天要游行的话，我就把那张火车票退了，我一个人去。”姐姐她说：“啊？游行……嗯，学校放暑假了，……就，就不游行了。”
    大志：真的？小毛：唔，我给她告诉去！（小毛气冲冲地奔里屋，大志一把拦住）
    小毛：你不是说，要跟坏现象作斗争吗？
    大志：可你硬把她留下，她认识不到这次游行的意义，也是白搭。小毛：对！妈偏心眼，总宠着她，等爸爸回来，告诉爸爸。大志：不，也不告诉爸爸。这事我们自己解决。
    小毛：自己？
    大志：你忘了，前几天我跟你说什么来着？
    小毛：什么呀？大志：毛主席说的，你再想想……。
    小毛：（摸摸脖子）毛主席说的，……
    大志：毛主席不是要求咱们加强锻炼自己的分析问题……
    小毛：和解决问题的能力吗？
    大志：这不正是咱们锻炼自己的好机会吗？
    小毛：嗯。可是姐姐她……
    大志：又没信心了？
    小毛：那好吧！
    大志：一言为定！
    小毛：一言为定！……可是她偏要走呢？……（猛一拍大腿）我有个好主意，保险她走不了，她不是要比分数吗！……
  （这时母亲、小宜从里屋出来。
    大志：妈！
    母亲：大志，你这回考的……（见小毛、小宜在旁，不好说下去）去，你俩去看看你爸爸回来没有！小宜：妈，咱们上火车站吧，不能等爸爸了。小毛：不行，你不能走！母亲：小毛，听话！
  （母亲、小宜刚要说什么，小毛忙用手势制止，匆匆走过去从墙上摘下书包，站到屋子中央。
    小毛：（郑重地对母亲）谁考得好带谁回姥姥家，妈，这是不是您说的！（转对小宜）嘿，你的分数要是比不上哥哥，你可得自动留下！
    小宜：那当然了！
    （“啪”的一声，小毛从书包里掏出记分册拍在桌子上。
    小毛：我去不了，认了！
    （又是“啪”的一声，小宜也将记分册拍在桌子上。
    小毛：哥哥，就差你的了。
    大志：小毛，这样不好。
    母亲：小宜，刚才我怎么跟你说的？快把记分册收起来，一会你爸爸就回来了！小毛：爸爸回来怕什么，正好，就是让爸爸看嘛！
   （“给我看什么呀？”随着话音门开了，父亲出现在门口。
    小毛：（飞跑过去）爸爸！您来得正好，快给我们当裁判吧！
    母亲：小毛，别胡闹！你爸爸刚从矿上回来，快让他歇会儿！
  （母亲边说边用手势示意小宜将记分册收起，哪知这时父亲已走到桌旁坐下。
    父亲：哎，你们听说了吧，明天要举行支持黑人斗争、反对美帝国主义的游行！我们矿上也参加，你们学校也参加吧？
    母亲：学校不是从今天就放假了吗，要是他们游行，我就不买火车票了。看，我这就带小宜走了。
    小毛：（实在憋不住了）就不该带姐姐去！
    父亲：嗬，这是怎么了？矛盾还挺尖锐啊！
    小毛：爸爸，这是大是大非问题嘛！姐姐她……
    （大志拦住小毛，小声地向小毛解释，并暗示地“一言为定”。
    小宜：妈，爸爸不看我们的记分册啦？
    母亲：（白了小宜一眼）还看什么！说带你去，就带你去，还不行吗？
  （对父亲）我早先给他们许下愿了，谁要考得好，就带谁上姥姥家。
    父亲：（轻松地）我可不同意你这个做法，（对孩子）你们同意你妈的意见吗？
    小毛：就我哥哥不同意。
    父亲：噢？（满意地看着大志点了点头。对小毛）你哥哥为什么不同意呢？是不是他学习不好啊？
    小毛：不是！爸爸您还不知道，哥哥他是用功大王，这回准又是门门一百！
    父亲：嗯，你自己呢？
    小毛：（低下了头）我……我……
    父亲：大志，你看过他们的记分册了吗？
    大志：还没有。
    父亲：大志，你当哥哥的，应当经常关心他们的进步和学习，你是共青团员，他们都是队员，你有这个权利，也有这个义务。（走到脸盆架前，擦脸）你先看看他们记分册，结合他们平时的表现，谈谈你的意见。（大志走到桌前，刚要拿起记分册……
    小宜：我不同意。要看就三人的都看。
    母亲：小宜！我说小宜他爸爸！时间可不早了，出门这事，可是赶早不赶晚，可别误了火车呀！
    父亲：（擦完脸走回来）不是六点半的车吗？（摸出了老怀表）来得及。
    大志：爸爸，还是您看吧。（母亲找出茶壶，小宜给父亲倒茶）
    父亲：（坐在椅子上，看见了桌上的记分册）嗬，记分册都摆好了。（顺手拿起一本，但没摸着眼镜）小毛，先念念你的。（小毛不得已，慢腾腾地接过记分册。
    小毛：（念）“语文七十……
    父亲：不，先念念你的操行评语。
    小毛：（念）“热爱劳动，愿为集体做好事，热心帮助同学……”
  （大志从一旁将眼镜递给父亲。
    父亲：不错嘛！我看看。（带上眼镜）嗯，有进步。小毛，看一个人的好坏得先看这个，（指了指脑袋）这儿是发动机，你说对不对？（翻了一页）八十，八十三，……八十……
    小毛：八十九！
    父亲：八十九！八十九！（往下看）六十一。
    小毛：我对自然没兴趣！
    父亲：没兴趣？嗯，（对大志、小宜）你们说，怎么就有兴趣？
    小宜：老考六七十分当然没兴趣了，你要加把劲，考个八十以上，就越学越来劲啦！
    父亲：噢？（对大志）你说呢？
    大志：（想了想）小毛，你说这地里头都有什么？
    小毛：煤。大志：对，爸爸不是常说煤是黑色的金子，是工业上的粮食，我们生活中就离不开它。
    小毛：对了，要是没有煤就不能做饭不能烧水。
    大志：对，那你再说说这地里还有什么呢？
    小毛：（不摸头脑地）土呗，还有什么？
    大志：要是把土变成大馒头，把土变成你穿的衣服，把土变成你脚上的胶鞋，你有兴趣没有？
    小毛：那不成了变戏法了吗？我最爱看了。
    大志：那做馒头的麦子，做衣服的棉花，做胶鞋的橡胶，不就是从地里长出来的？学自然不就是学这些常识吗？
    小毛：对呀！（摸了摸后脑勺，兴趣盎然的）让你这么一说，到是有意思啦！
    父亲：你要是亲自参加参加土变馒头的劳动，参加参加挖煤的劳动，就会更有意思了。小毛，从你的成绩上看，还是有进步的，可是基础知识还不过硬，要刻苦学习啊！
  （小毛点点头）
    母亲：这次小宜可不软啊，两门八十，一门九十，两门一百！
    父亲：（对小宜）是吗，成绩不低呀！拿来，我看看你的操行评语。
    （接过记分册，翻开，仔细的看着，皱了皱眉头，念）热爱劳动，遵守纪律，作业完成得好，学习成绩优良。小宜，老师没说你有什么缺点吗？
    小宜：老师没说。
    小毛：姐姐老爱跟同学比分数。
    小宜：那有什么，我们王老师说分数应该考得高嘛，他还说：你们要是门门功课都考个九十分以上，保险你们能升学……。
    父亲：老师没跟你们说要一颗红心，多种准备吗？（小宜不语）（慢慢的放下记分册）
    父亲：小宜你要上姥姥家去？
    （小宜点了点头。
    父亲：（摘下眼镜，插入上衣口袋）那好吧，我同意你去。（对大志、小毛）你们的意见呢？
    小毛：我不同意！爸爸。
    大志：爸爸，我想和小宜个别谈话。
    小宜：甭！
    父亲：（向大志、小毛解释地）我让她去，倒不是因为她分数考得高，是为了……（转对小宜）你去是去，不过对你有个要求。
    小宜：您说吧，什么要求都成！
    父亲：就一条：到了乡下，每天都要下地干活，还要想一想，人民公社的广大社员辛勤劳动是为了什么，你自己上学又是为了什么，写篇心得，回来给我看看。
    小宜：嗯。
    母亲：（一块石头落了地，对小宜）时候不早了，快到里屋拾掇拾掇吧！（母亲和小宜进里屋）
    小毛：（着急地）哥哥，你怎么不说话呀？
    （一个同学喊着“大志！”“大志！”跑上。
    同学：大志，你找到小宜了吗？
    小毛：她要跟我妈上姥姥家。
    同学：那可怎么办哪，明天一早就游行，现在换人也来不及了！
    大志：告诉同学们，我一定动员她留下。
    同学：那我们就在学校等她了。
  （下）
    大志：好。
  （小宜、母亲、父亲提着网兜等物从里屋出。
    大志：小宜，刚才你们班的同学又来找你了。
    小毛：他们说……（大志制止）
  （小宜脸刷地红了，想说什么，没张开口。
    大志：我跟他说你一会儿就去。
    母亲：什么？这就该上车站了！
    父亲：你们是不是有要紧事？
    母亲：什么事，回来说不成？
    小毛：回来说就晚了！
    母亲：那就让你哥哥先替她办了。
  （要走）
    大志：我，我不是女的！小宜，你来，我跟你说……
    小宜：说什么呀？是不是找你的记分册呀？在我这儿哪！
    母亲：（制止地）小宜！火车都快开了！
  （小宜拿起网兜。
    小毛：反对撒谎！
    大志：（制止地）小毛！
    父亲：你们究竟是怎么回事？
    小毛：（指小宜）就不该带她去嘛！
    小宜：为什么？
    小毛：因为你……（大志做一言为定手势制止）你自己还不知道！
    小宜：我当然知道了，谁考得好就带谁去！
    父亲：唔？（这句话显然是刺激了父亲，但又耐着性子听下去。
    小毛：就凭分数也轮不上你！（对小宜）你的成绩跟哥哥的比起来，还是这个！（晃了晃小拇指）
    小宜：（撇了一下嘴）
    小毛：你甭撇嘴！有能耐你跟哥哥比！
    小宜：比就比！（瞪了大志一眼，要掏记分册）
    母亲：（又是申斥，又是哀求）小宜！（威胁地）火车快开了！
    父亲：（一直仔细地观察着这一切）不忙，有时间。
    小毛：不敢比了吧！
    大志：小毛！妹妹，你听我说……
    小宜：甭说了，不是比分数吗？（从兜里掏出记分册）我的，爸爸看过了，这是你的！（将记分册撂在桌子上）
  （静场。小宜发现这样做不对，忙用手捂住记分册）这不是……
    小毛：（奔过去，忙拿起记分册，翻开）初二甲班周大志——这不是哥哥的是谁的。（翻一页）你们听着（嘴张开了，但声音象卡住了似的；什么也没念出来。）
    父亲：怎么回事，拿来，我看看。
  （静场。小毛把记分册递给父亲……大志低着头，母亲皱着眉，小毛瞪着眼……座钟“当、当、……”打了五下。
    父亲：小宜，小毛，你们到里屋去。
  （小宜不动，小毛进到里屋，没关门，站在屋门口往外看。）
    父亲：（温和的）大志，你怎么考坏了，有什么原因吧！
    大志：没有。
    母亲：上个月开家长会，老师还跟我说，咱大志学习得很好啊！大家都夸他是个好学生。
    父亲：这就是你的评语？（大志点了点头）“……对一些不正确的思想，不能积极地展开斗争，”还“不能耐心地帮助同志”，嗯？（又指了指记分册）这就是你的成绩？大志：是。爸爸，我学习得不好。
    （静场。父亲：你入团多少日子了？
    大志：（想了想）六个月零三天了。
    父亲：那你入团以后为什么反而不如以前了？
    大志：……
    父亲：你还记得，在你入团宣誓的那天早晨我跟你说的话吗？那不只是父亲对儿子的要求，更主要的是一个老兵对一个新战士的要求，一个共产党员对一个共青团员的要求，可你……（小毛陡地跑出来，站在父亲面前。
    小毛：爸爸！爸爸！我敢保证，哥哥入团以后，比过去更严格要求自己。您不信……对了！（跑到里屋，抱过来两罗本子和一块矿石）您看，这是哥哥读了毛主席的书以后写的笔记；这是哥哥做的课外数学题，还有哥哥在星期天经常参加矿上的劳动，你看这是他带回来做标本用的矿石。
   （父亲翻阅着这些本子。小毛：您别看我哥哥的分数比姐姐低，可我敢保证，就是比姐姐学得好。（猛地一拍大腿）有了。爸爸，我给你出个主意好不好？
    母亲：你出的都是馊主意。父亲：（对母亲）你让他说。
    小毛：您就来个当场考试。对，当场比武打擂台！（连蹦带跳地跑到父亲跟前）您看好不好？
    父亲：好，好，对！（走过去）大志，小宜，我再考考你们怎么样？母亲：哎呀！还考什么，我看你是要让那两张火车票作废呀！
    小宜：妈您让爸爸考我们吧！（自言自语的，可又好象是故意说给别人听）哼，反正我记分册上的分数，也不是自己写上去的！
    母亲：你们今儿是怎么了……父亲：你别说了，这个质量今天我是检查定了！
    小毛：妈妈，（把妈妈推进里屋）
    母亲：唉！（向里屋走去，边走边叨念）我算是拿你们没法子。（母亲进屋。小毛轻轻地摆好三个凳子。
    小毛：（高兴地拍着手）?，考试了，考试了！快进教室了（放好小凳子，举起手，做着摇铃动作，走着喊）当啷，当啷，爸爸（指中间的椅子示意爸爸坐下），哥哥。（把大志拉过来坐下）（小宜、大志分坐在父亲两旁，小毛站到哥哥身后。）
    父亲：（嗽了一下嗓子，郑重地）第一个问题，做一个无产阶级接班人都应该具备什么条件？
    小宜：我说（站起来）。一共五条。（摆出背书的姿势，以机关枪的节奏）第一，他们必须是真正的马克思列宁主义者。第二，他们必须是全心全意为中国和世界的绝大多数人服务的革命者。第三，他们必须是能够团结绝大多数人一道工作的无产阶级政治家。不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要……
    父亲：好，好，你背得很熟呀！
    小宜：（得意地看了大志一眼）我估计考试时准有这个题，我自己还默写了两遍呢！（坐下）
    父亲：那你说，这五条当中哪一条最重要？小宜：老师说，第二条。
    父亲：那你给说说。
    小宜：老师说第一条是理论是方向，第二条是目的，第三四五条是方法。
    父亲：对，那为什么第二条是最重要的呢？
    小宜：老师没说，王老师说的他怎么讲我们就怎么答……要象您这样刨根问底就没完了。
    父亲：大志，你说说。大志：老师讲完了，我就想，要是没有第二条，那第一条就变成了一句空话；第三、四、五条就根本不可能做到。所以，我认为全心全意为中国和世界的绝大多数人服务是最根本最重要的。小宜：这又是你自己发挥的吧！大志：不，你想想，我们所学的毛主席的文章，不论是政治课上学的，还是语文课上学的，还是自学的，几乎是每一篇，都说要为广大人民服务。对了，（掏出一小本子打开）你听毛主席这句话：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务……”今天我们努力学习知识，不就是为了明天更好地去为人民服务吗。
    父亲：（不住地点头）好，好！你体会得比较深刻，回答得好。（小毛从父亲身后绕过去，正要向小宜做鬼脸，见小宜正在冷笑。
    小毛：爸爸！您看姐姐又在那撇嘴哪！（对小宜）什么态度！小宜：（对父亲）本来嘛，您问的这问题，课本上，老师给抄的笔记里，都没有。（提起书包交给父亲）不信您就查。
    父亲：你呀……（顺手拿出一本书，翻看了几眼）好，我就问你书上的，“在家禽的饲料里，为什么要加进少量的沙粒？”
    小宜：哟！您问的是“动物”课本上的！（笑着说）您还不知道呀！“动物”、“历史”、“物理”都是光学不考！
    父亲：不考不等于我们可以不会，不知道。大志，你说说这个问题书上是怎么解释的？大志：……书上说……（小毛两眼瞪得圆圆地望着哥哥，下意识地给哥哥扇着扇子。
    大志：对了！（跑到书桌前，拉开抽屉，取出一小盒）您看。
    小毛：哟，这不是鸡屎吗？大志：是呀，在老师讲这个问题时，
  我还不大相信，就做了个试验……把咱家老母鸡、大公鸡、小母鸡，都关了起来，不让它们吃到一点沙粒，并注意观察它们拉出的屎。开头几天还没什么，可后来，在鸡屎里就发现了没有消化的谷粒。这就证明了课本上说的是正确的。对了，书上说的是沙粒在家禽的消化中，有磨碎饲料、帮助消化的作用。（父亲赞赏地点点头。
    小宜：尽问这些记分册上根本就不记分的。
    父亲：（颇为不满地）小宜！（停了停）孩子，党和国家办学校，是让你们学知识，学本领，将来好干革命，好接我们老一代的班，上学不是为了应付考试，更不是让你去往家里背分数。你呀，脑袋的油泥还不少哪……等你从佬佬家回来，看看你的心得以后，我还要好好跟你谈一次。（对大志）大志，你喜欢动脑筋，分析问题，知识学得活，这都很好。可是大志，你可得记住，学知识得一步一个脚印，特别是中小学阶段，正是打基础的时候，得一砖一瓦地往上垒，半点马虎不得！你看你几何才考了个七十五分，这能说你的基础知识学得好吗？
    大志：对，爸爸，我一定记住您的话。我的学习是不好。
  （父亲点了点头。母亲提着壶，端着碗站在屋门口已经听了半天了，这时才算松了一口气。
    母亲：（走过来）这就对了！说了归其，还是怨我，你在段上工作，管教孩子的责任，我没负起来。不过，话又说回来，咱这孩子们也都不错了，小宜虽说脑瓜儿死，可基本知识记得牢；大志哪，虽说这回分数上差点儿，可以前门门功课都是九十分以上。得了，时候也不早了，你喝碗凉开水败败火，就送我们上车站吧！
  （说着斟了一碗水递给父亲，又提起网兜等递给小宜）
  （父亲喝完水，小宜随着父亲向门口走去，母亲跟在后面。
    大志：（坐下，又站起）等一等！
  （众皆惊愕。
    母亲：你，你又干什么？大志：妈……（看小宜）妹妹，你过来……
    父亲：（严肃地）大志，究竟是什么事？
    大志：爸爸……小宜……她应当留下。
    小宜：好吧，我留下，你去！（把东西丢在地上）
    小毛：（气急了，冲着小宜）没羞！
  （呼口号似的）坚决反对撒谎！
    小宜：我撒谎？哼！（指桌上）就连这个……小毛：连什么？连什么？你别赖皮！
    小宜：（实在气急了）就连这个七十多分的记分册都是假的。
  （父亲一步一步地走到桌前，缓缓地拿起记分册，戴上眼镜。
    小宜：上面根本没有校印！校长的戳子、教导主任的戳子、连班主任的戳子都没有！那字，也都是他自己写的！
    父亲：大志……你……你……你办这样的事！
    大志：爸爸，这的确是我的成绩。
    父亲：什么？大志：这是我真正的成绩。
  （父亲猛地走向桌子，举拳欲击，又放下。
    母亲：（对大志）你，你……看，把你爸爸气的！还不快说实话！
    大志：爸爸！（冲过去）我说，我全说。
  （母亲拧了一把凉手巾递给父亲。
    大志：（不知从哪儿说起）上学期，就在我入团后的第三天……
  （父亲喝了口水，钟的搭的搭的响着）团区委书记李先同志找我们学校几个刚入团的团员开了个会，他问我们：“你们常说我们将要肩负的担子是重的，你们能不能说一说，这个担子到底有多重？”大伙你看看我，我看看你，谁也答不出来。李先同志显得很激动，又问我们：“你们听得见台湾监狱里传来的脚镣声吗？你们听得见南越集中营里孩子们的啼哭声吗？你们听得见抽在刚果人民身上的鞭子声吗？你们听得见美国佬又在屠杀巴拿马人民的机枪声吗？听不到这些，就是得了一百分也没用，也不可能得到真正的一百分。一个真正的革命者，他的眼睛要看着全世界”！
    父亲：说得对。大志：出了团区委会门，我一边走，一边想起了天安门前的五星红旗，想起了大队辅导员在烈士纪念碑前给我们讲的故事，越想越觉得自己的担子重，越觉得象我以前那样学习、工作、生活，是不配做一个工人阶级的儿子的！
    小毛：哥哥，这跟记分册有什么关系呀？！大志：要想担起重担子，就必须好好学习，严格要求自己，象解放军叔叔那样，练出过硬本领。后来我就到文具店，买了这本记分册，每次老师提问、测验以后，我就根据当时自己掌握知识的真正情况，给自己记上一个分数。比如：这次期末考几何，一共出了五道题，让选做四道，我做对了四道，老师给判的是一百分，可我没做的那道，我就不会，您说，这不应当给自己记上七十五分吗！另外，我把自己的缺点，也写在上面。象——我对妹妹的帮助不够，我认为这就是自己不能积极地开展思想斗争。我觉得这样做会随时提醒自己不要满足，不要骄傲。
  （停了停）学校发的记分册在这儿。（从兜里掏出来）
    小毛：（一把抢过，大声念）“为革命而学的目的明确，关心国内外革命斗争形势，知识学的活，并能结合实际！”（又翻过一篇，念）“政治九十五，语文九十八，代数一百，几何一百，英语一百！”爸爸
  （将记分册给父亲）
    父亲：（站起来）（从小毛手中接过记分册看了看，又拿起桌上的记分册，对着看了看。不无感慨地点点头，走到大志面前，拍了拍大志的肩膀）好儿子！你是咱工人阶级的好儿子！母亲：（兴奋地）孩子，你真是好样的，你对自己要求可真高呀！
    大志：不，妈，不是我自己要求高，这是党，是毛主席对我们的要求，我们要把红旗举到底，要把祖国建设成共产主义。可帝国主义、修正主义要欺侮咱们！妈妈（说着走到里屋，拿出一个画着世界地图的木板，上面插着不少的红白小旗。地图顶上写着大字：“眼观全球，心怀世界”）妈妈，您看，世界上还有多少地方让帝国主义霸占着，在非洲，那里的小弟弟小妹妹们比小毛还小，天不亮就起来了，可他们不是去上学，而是象爸爸小时候一样到窑底下去背煤，他们趴在地上爬呀，爬呀，膝盖胳膊都磨出了血！在南朝鲜，美国鬼子抢走了许多孩子，运到美国，卖给大资本家当奴隶，都活活的给折磨死了。在越南南方，美国鬼子把小孩绑在树上当枪靶子，他们还把小孩的心肝挖出来吃了！……小毛：妈妈，看这张照片，一个黑人小妹妹手里拿着饭碗，眼巴巴地等着他妈带吃的回来，可是她再也见不到自己的妈妈了，她妈妈被白人资本家给打死了，……
    大志：妈妈，您说我们要是不好好学习，不严格要求自己或是取得了一点成绩就满足了，那……
    小宜：（激动得流下了眼泪）爸爸，哥哥，我错了！哥哥，我说你怎么学习劲头总是那么足，学得总是那么好哪，你不光在纸上画了张大地图，原来在你心里也有张大地图啊！哥哥，我一定参加明天的游行，我现在就去排活报剧！
    小毛：姐姐，好姐姐，以后我一定象哥哥那样严格要求自己，学习不再从兴趣出发了。
    母亲：这回我也明白了，看谁学得好不好，是要看他能不能为革命学习，不在分数多少。明天我也参加游行，现在我就去退火车票。等游行完了，我再带小宜去姥姥家。父亲：这才是呀，站得高，才能望得远；望得远，才不至于因为得了一百分就以为到头了。
    大志：（深思地点点头）爸爸，照您的意思能不能说一百分不算满分？小毛：一百分不算满分？小宜：一百分不算满分！？
    小毛：爸爸，那怎么样才能算是满分哪？
    父亲：大志，你说呢？大志：当我戴上矿工帽，拿起风镐，接上您的班，当上一名真正的矿工的时候，把我所学习的知识用在生产上，让黑色的金子去为社会主义建设、为世界革命服务，那时，人民给我打了一百分，才是真正的一百。父亲：说得很对，一个真正的无产阶级革命接班人，永远要向前看，在他的心里，永远也不能给自己打上一百分！
