    Taking a Risk in Desperation
    Thai Prime Minister Thanom said: "The risks Thailand is taking are already great. Even if we send troops to Vietnam, the risks will not be any greater."
    It seems that Thanom is aware of the risk that the Thai reactionaries are taking by acting as pawns of U.S. imperialism, the risk of being buried with them. Therefore, he plans to simply go all out. An ancient Chinese book says: "Taking a risk in desperation, how can one choose in a hurry?" The Thai reactionaries today hold just such a sentiment.

    铤而走险
    泰国总理他侬说：“泰国所担的风险已经很大，即使出兵越南，风险也不会再大一些。”
    看来，对于泰国反动派充当美帝国主义走卒是冒着殉葬的风险的这一点，他侬是心里有数的，因而他打算干脆豁出去了。中国古书说：“铤而走险，急何能择？”泰国反动派今天所抱的正是这样一种心情。
