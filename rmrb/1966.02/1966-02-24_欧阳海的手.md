　　Ouyang Hai's Hands
　　Worker of Beijing Automobile Branch Company　Wang Zhongjun
    The novel "Song of Ouyang Hai" successfully portrays the image of a communist revolutionary hero. At the same time, it enthusiastically praises Ouyang Hai's heroic hands.
    In the wind and snow of the old society, his hands had held the broken basket for begging for rice and the stick for beating dogs. In the sunshine of the new society, he angrily raised his fist and shouted the slogan "Down with the landlord class!" To protect the people's revolutionary fruits, he took up his gun and went to the front line of battle. When our country suffered from serious natural disasters, Comrade Ouyang Hai came to the construction site with those heroic hands. "When someone tried to force us to retreat, these hands did not clasp together in supplication, but were deeply thrust into the mud, laboring with handfuls of soil and water to hold high the proletariat's revolutionary red flag!" What noble heroism this is! These hands demonstrate the indomitable spirit of the Chinese people and the fighting will of the Chinese people to strive for progress!
    Ouyang Hai's hands beat and pulsate in rhythm with the people, every blood vessel flowing with the blood of a proletarian revolutionary fighter, every handprint filled with his deep affection for the revolution and the people. These hands rescued an old woman from a fire and lifted a drowning little girl from a well; these hands chopped firewood and boiled tea for old poor peasants with no children, and in the emergency when a train was about to derail, Ouyang Hai resolutely used his heroic hands to push away the warhorse blocking the way, saving the lives of thousands of people, sacrificing himself with a smile...
    Ouyang Hai's hands are the hands of an ordinary working person, why can his hands reach out to the people completely and thoroughly, for the revolution? Ouyang Hai himself answered this question. He said: "People should read Chairman Mao's books more to have the strength to move forward!" Because he had deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's writings and truly understood their great revolutionary significance, when his hands took over Chairman Mao's books, it was like holding a red sun. Regardless of frost and cold dew, regardless of the heat and wind, he was learning, thinking, and applying. Chairman Mao's books became this warrior's indispensable food, and the brilliance of Chairman Mao's thought illuminated his journey forward, making his hands capable of picking up grass and wood when small, and smoothing over the world when large. Isn't it? From "The red flag unfurls the serf's halberd, the black hand raises high the tyrant's whip" to "Only heroes dare to drive away tigers and leopards, and no heroes fear bears," under the armed forces of Mao Zedong Thought, how many ordinary hands have become heroic hands, fearless hands, hands capable of changing the world!
    Comrade Ouyang Hai's hands are the hands of our proletarian warriors that cannot be worn out. We must, like Ouyang Hai, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and create pairs of heroic hands. With these heroic hands, smash the old world and create a bright red new world!

　　欧阳海的手
　　北京汽车分公司工人　王中均
    长篇小说《欧阳海之歌》成功地塑造了一个共产主义革命英雄的形象。同时，它也热情地歌颂了欧阳海的一双英雄的手。
    在旧社会的风雪中，他的手曾经提过讨米的破篮，拿过打狗的棍子。在新社会的阳光中，他愤怒地举起了拳头，高喊过“打倒地主阶级！”的口号，为了保卫人民的革命果实，他又拿起了枪，走上了战斗的第一线。正当我国遭受到严重自然灾害的时候，欧阳海同志又带着那双英雄的手来到建设工地。“当有人妄想逼着我们退却时，这双手没有合十作揖，而是深深地插到泥里边来，为了高举无产阶级的革命红旗，它一把土、一捧水地劳动着！”这是何等崇高的英雄气概！这双手表现了中国人民永不屈服的硬骨头精神，表现了中国人民奋发图强的战斗意志！
    欧阳海这双手和人民同脉搏、共跳动，每一条血管里都流动着一个无产阶级革命战士的血液，每按一个手印都倾注了他对革命、对人民的满腔深情。这双手，曾经在烈火中抢救过一位老大娘，在水井中举过一个溺水的小女孩；这双手，曾经为无儿无女的老贫农砍过柴烧过茶，而在列车将要覆轨遭难的紧急时刻，欧阳海又用他那双英雄的手毅然推开拦路的战马，夺下了千百人的生命，自己却含笑牺牲……。
    欧阳海的手是一双普通的劳动人民的手，为什么他的手就能完全、彻底的伸向人民，用于革命？欧阳海自己回答了这个问题。他说：“人要多读毛主席的书才有前进的力量！”正因为他对毛主席著作怀有深厚的阶级感情，真正懂得它的伟大革命意义，因此当他这双手接过毛主席的书的时候，就象捧起了一颗红太阳。不管霜寒露冷，不管暑热风狂，他都在学，在想，在用。毛主席的书成为这位战士不可缺少的食粮，毛主席的思想光辉照亮了他前进的征途，使他这双手变得小能拈草木，大能抚五洲了。不是么？从“红旗卷起农奴戟，黑手高悬霸主鞭。”到“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴”，在毛泽东思想的武装下，有多少双普通的手变成了英雄的手，无畏的手，能够改天换地的手！
    欧阳海同志的手，是我们无产阶级战士磨不烂的手。我们要象欧阳海那样，用毛泽东思想武装自己，造就一双双英雄的手。用这双英雄的手，打碎旧世界，创造一个红通通的新世界！
