    Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulty,
    Conquering the difficult passes is a true hero;
    See whose work style is the toughest,
    Let's compete beside the steelmaking furnace.
    The lathe needs to be fast with good steel,
    Diligently study and practice to strengthen skills,
    Learn skills well for the revolution,
    Chairman's works are the direction.
    Red flowers in ten thousand clusters bloom in the spring,
    You chase me, and a heat wave turns;
    Strive for advancement in "Two Innovations" and "Five Goods",
    Not being in the upper reaches is not satisfactory.
    Mutual assistance and cooperation is a good custom,
    When encountering difficulties, everyone helps,
    Ten thousand red hearts for the collective,
    When there is honor, yield to each other.
    The younger generation should surpass the older generation,
    Tomorrow should be better than today,
    To climb the peak, establish great ambitions,
    We dare to surpass the world level.

    后浪要比前浪高
    马鞍山钢铁公司　山峰
    不怕艰苦不怕难，
    攻破重关是好汉；
    看谁作风过得硬，
    炼钢炉旁比比看。
    车刀要快凭好钢，
    勤学苦练技术强，
    学好本领为革命，
    主席著作是方向。
    红花万朵春烂漫，
    你追我赶热浪翻；
    “双革”“五好”争先进，
    不达上游心不甘。
    互助协作好风尚，
    遇到困难大家帮，
    万颗红心为集体，
    有了荣誉互相让。
    后浪要比前浪高，
    明天要比今天好，
    为登高峰树雄心，
    世界水平咱敢超。
