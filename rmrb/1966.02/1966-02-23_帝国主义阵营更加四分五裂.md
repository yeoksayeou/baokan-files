　　The imperialist bloc is in the midst of great turmoil, great division, and great reorganization. The contradictions between the United States and Western European countries have deepened and intensified significantly, and the contradictions between the Western European countries have further developed.

　　Due to further changes in the balance of capitalist world economic power that are unfavorable to the United States, the United States' hegemonic position in the imperialist camp has been further shaken, and its control over Western Europe has been greatly weakened. Coupled with the repeated setbacks and constraints on the United States' aggressive policies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially in Vietnam, it is in an even more passive and defensive position in Western Europe.

　　France Takes Offensive to Strike at U.S. Hegemony

　　The Franco-American contradiction is the most prominent contradiction within the current imperialist bloc. Last year, France repeatedly took offensive actions, launching challenges to the privileged position of the dollar in the economic field and openly demanding the reorganization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the political field. This marks a new stage in France's anti-American struggle, one that fundamentally strikes at U.S. hegemony.

　　The dollar is one of the main weapons used by the United States for economic expansion and political control abroad. In recent years, the dollar has been increasingly devalued, but the United States still uses its position as the main international reserve currency to invest heavily in Western European countries and occupy their markets. France, therefore, took advantage of its favorable conditions of having a surplus in international payments and increased gold and foreign exchange reserves in recent years to exchange dollars for gold. Under the leadership of France, other Western European countries followed suit. This has greatly increased the U.S. gold outflow. Of the $1.65 billion in gold lost by the United States last year, France accounted for half of the dollars exchanged for gold. Under these circumstances, the position of the dollar has been further shaken. In addition to this, France has stepped up its restrictions on U.S. investment in France and delayed the "Kennedy Round" negotiations to strike at the United States economically.

　　On the issue of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, France has also launched an offensive against the United States. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the main tool for the United States to control its Western allies under the name of "military integration" and dominate Western Europe. For several years, France has taken various measures of resistance and non-cooperation because its demands for reorganizing the alliance to improve France's position have not been met. The "Multilateral Nuclear Force" plan, which the United States implemented for nuclear control over Western Europe, has been resisted by France and coldly received by other Western European countries, and was forced to be temporarily shelved at the beginning of last year. McNamara's proposal in May last year to establish a "Nuclear Special Committee" in the group and give West Germany a voice in the use of nuclear forces has also failed. Not only that, but starting in the second half of last year, France took advantage of the United States' deep involvement in the quagmire of the Vietnam War to repeatedly propose the complete reorganization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. A French magazine, *Foreign Policy*, close to the government, revealed that France advocates changing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization into a dual alliance: Western European countries should form an internal alliance themselves, and then form an alliance with the United States on a completely equal basis. Western newspapers have also rumored that France advocates that Western European countries sign bilateral alliances with the United States separately to replace the North Atlantic Treaty. On February 21, French President Charles de Gaulle reiterated at a press conference the demand to amend the North Atlantic Treaty, reclaim French sovereignty from the American-controlled North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and emphasized that France should maintain its autonomy and not be dragged into war by the United States. France's repeated demands for a thorough reorganization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are aimed at ending the United States' control over Western Europe and having France take the lead in Western Europe. This will inevitably lead to further disintegration of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which was already on the verge of collapse. Although the United States is greatly annoyed by these actions of France, it is unable to take forceful retaliatory actions due to its predicament in South Vietnam.

　　West Germany's Relations with the United States are Not Rosy

　　In recent years, West Germany has been using the contradictions between the United States and France to improve its position by siding with the United States against France and with France against the United States, playing both sides. After Erhard came to power, relying on the United States became the dominant aspect of West Germany's foreign policy. However, since West Germany's economic strength has jumped to second place in the capitalist world in recent years, it is not willing to be in a position of being controlled politically and militarily. The West German *Bonn Review* complained in the middle of last year that West Germany's alliance with the United States "provides relative security," but "also shackles Bonn's policies."

　　Economically, West Germany has always been the United States' main competitor in the Western European market. The large-scale invasion of Western Europe by U.S. capital has always made West German monopoly capital uneasy. West German Minister of Economics Schmücker publicly criticized the Americans for "buying European companies at half the price at the current dollar exchange rate." Some West German companies have long used methods such as accelerating mergers and concentrations to deal with the U.S. invasion of the Western European market. On the issue of currency, West Germany has taken a consistent stand with France, exchanging large amounts of dollars for gold from the United States on the one hand, and demanding the reform of the current international monetary system based on the dollar on the other.

　　Politically, although West Germany pursues a pro-American foreign policy, advocating the establishment of an "Atlantic Europe" led by the United States and dominated by West Germany, its strategic goal is to restrain France, dominate Britain, and strive for equal footing with the United States. Currently, West Germany has begun to demand the status of an "equal partner" in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. West German Foreign Minister Schröder publicly stated in May last year that West Germany has provided a large number of troops and expenses to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but its "joint decision-making power in the group's leadership is extremely insufficient." Former Minister of Defense Strauss, who represents the pro-French faction within the West German ruling group, even shouted loudly that the reorganization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is urgent, otherwise West Germany may withdraw. He also put forward a blueprint for "European unification," advocating the establishment of a future "United States of Europe" based on Britain, France, and West Germany, in order to establish "the second pillar of the Western defense community" outside of the United States. Of course, since West Germany still needs to rely on the United States to improve its position at present, this contradiction will not cause it to change its foreign policy line, which is mainly pro-American, for a considerable period of time.

　　The issue of nuclear weapons is a more prominent issue in the relationship between the United States and West Germany. West Germany has always been worried that the United States has postponed the timetable for arming West Germany with nuclear weapons because it wants to reach a secret deal with the Soviet Union. Recently, it has taken advantage of the difficult situation in which the United States urgently needs West German support to demand more from the United States. Erhard and Schröder have repeatedly stated that "West Germany has the right to resolve the issue of nuclear weapons within the alliance." However, when Erhard visited the United States not long ago, the communiqué of the talks between the two countries only mentioned in general terms that West Germany would have the right to "appropriately participate" in nuclear defense, and the United States did not make any promises to West Germany. Nuclear weapons are a trump card for the United States to control West Germany. In addition, the United States is eager to make another nuclear deal with the Soviet Union, so the United States needs to determine the timing and manner of West Germany's involvement in nuclear weapons based on its own interests. For West Germany, breaking through nuclear control is an important key to striving for great power status and an urgent requirement at present. Therefore, the differences between the two countries on the issue of nuclear weapons will become increasingly apparent.

　　As for other Western European countries, such as Britain and Italy, due to economic difficulties and political dependence on the United States, they have to adopt the practice of following the United States and drawing closer to the United States in diplomacy. However, their contradictions with the United States have also developed in issues such as resisting the penetration of U.S. capital and opposing the hegemonic status of the dollar.

　　Contradictions Between Western European Countries are Complex

　　Within Western Europe, the contradictions between countries are even more complex. Among them, the relationship between France and West Germany has been particularly acute in the past year.

　　The so-called "Paris-Bonn Axis" established by France and West Germany through treaties in the past was an alliance of expediency: both countries wanted to use each other to seize Western European hegemony. Since Erhard came to power in October 1963, the relationship between West Germany and France has become increasingly cold. Last year, the two countries launched a fierce struggle over the issue of West Germany's involvement in nuclear weapons and the establishment of a Western European political alliance. West Germany, together with Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, insisted on gradually strengthening the "supranational" nature of the "Common Market" as an exchange condition for reaching an agreement with France on the "Agricultural Common Fund" (mainly used to subsidize French agriculture), thereby provoking the most serious crisis since the establishment of the "Common Market".

　　While the "Common Market" crisis continued to develop, De Gaulle put forward the initiative to "Europeanize" the German issue, advocating that the issue of "German reunification" and the German border issue should be resolved through consultation by neighboring European countries, without the intervention of the United States; and France's relationship with the Soviet Union has also become increasingly close. This has caused West Germany's serious unease. De Gaulle also firmly stated to the United States that he could not tolerate West Germany's involvement in nuclear weapons, and also opposed West Germany's participation in the "Nuclear Special Committee." Not long ago, De Gaulle also said meaningfully in his election speech: "Germany (West Germany) is evolving. We absolutely do not know in which direction its ambitions will develop. Naturally, we hope it will develop in the right direction." These few words revealed the depth of France's concerns about West Germany.

　　In order to put themselves in an advantageous position in the struggle, both France and West Germany have been trying to win over Britain. De Gaulle not only made a 180-degree turn, but also began to promise that Britain could join the "Common Market" one day, and France and Britain continued to cooperate closely in the manufacture of the "Concorde" jet transport. West German Foreign Minister Schröder also visited Britain, and it is rumored that the two countries also have a secret agreement to hold regular consultations. The United States took the opportunity to instigate Britain to try to squeeze into the "Common Market" and suppress France. This further widened the rift between France and West Germany.

　　However, although the contradictions between France and West Germany are very acute, the two countries still have a mutually dependent side in both economic and political terms. Economically, the two countries' dependence on the "Common Market" is increasing: 39 percent of French exports and 36 percent of West German exports are destined for the "Common Market." Politically, the "Common Market" is also a means for them to enhance their strength and status and to fight or bargain with the United States, Britain, or other opponents. Especially today, when the Franco-American contradiction is sharpening and the contradiction between West Germany and the United States is also developing, France and West Germany need to leave room for maneuver in their relations. After a long stalemate of seven months, at the end of January this year, West Germany agreed, and the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg made concessions to France, reaching a compromise. Then Erhard visited Paris in a "friendly" atmosphere. This shows that the two countries are still prepared to use each other, and the relationship will not break down for the time being.

　　Britain's economic strength is weakening, its diplomatic policies are running into snags everywhere, and its international status is further declining. It is already in a supporting role on the Western European political stage. At present, although it has taken advantage of the contradictions between France and West Germany to gain some practical benefits and attempt to re-intervene in Western European affairs, it is further attached to the United States and busy dealing with the "great turmoil" in Asia to maintain its overseas interests, so it is impossible to have much influence in Europe.

　　In the rivalry between imperialist powers, the small countries of Western Europe are in a difficult situation, and the centrifugal tendencies are further developing. According to Western newspapers, some Northern European countries are already brewing to stand on their own after the collapse of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and form regional groups.

　　The Imperialist Camp is Further Dividing

　　Although the contradictions within the imperialist camp are complex, on the one hand, they are further divided, and on the other hand, they are showing a "alliance" trend. However, the struggle between control and anti-control between the United States and Western European countries is always the main contradiction among them. Although some countries seem to be the United States' "loyal little partners" at present, the demand to get rid of U.S. control is still growing in these countries. Even in Britain, which is so deeply attached to the United States, the *Financial Times*, a mouthpiece for British monopoly capital, has proposed joint action based on "Franco-British cooperation" to deal with the collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union. Especially at present, U.S. imperialism is gradually shifting the focus of its "global strategy" from Europe to Asia. In addition to stepping up its collusion with Soviet leaders to "stabilize" the European situation, it is also trying to force Western European countries to increase their conventional forces stationed in Western Europe. This further exacerbates the contradictions between the United States and Western European countries. At present, the U.S. government is trying its best to seek the support of Western European allies for its policy of expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam and Indochina. However, France has its own set of ideas on the Vietnam issue, and other countries have also expressed indifference to the U.S. demands, and even West Germany and Britain are not enthusiastic about providing military support. In the future, the United States will inevitably weaken its control over Western Europe as it invests more power in Asia. As the United States suffers more setbacks in pursuing aggression in Asia, especially as it suffers greater and greater failures in the war of aggression against Vietnam, Western European countries will inevitably take advantage of the United States' predicament to strengthen their struggle against the United States. In the end, the internal imperialist camp will inevitably be in "great turmoil", with drastic divisions and reorganizations. For the United States, when its "alliance leader" status completely collapses, there will inevitably be a situation of "the tree falls and the monkeys scatter", and "everyone pushes the wall when it falls".

### 帝国主义阵营更加四分五裂

1966-02-23
第5版()
专栏：时事述评

　　帝国主义阵营更加四分五裂
    帝国主义集团正处在大动荡、大分化、大改组的过程中。美国同西欧国家之间的矛盾大大加深和激化了，西欧各国之间的矛盾也有了进一步的发展。
    由于资本主义世界经济实力的对比进一步发生了不利于美国的变化，美国在帝国主义阵营的霸主地位已经进一步动摇，对西欧的控制能力大大削弱。再加上美国在亚非拉地区、特别是在越南推行侵略政策连受挫败，力量受到牵制，因而在西欧更处于被动招架的境地。
    法国采取攻势打击美国霸权
    法美矛盾，是当前帝国主义集团内部最突出的矛盾。去年一年，法国多次采取攻势，在经济方面对美元的特权地位发动了挑战，在政治方面公开要求改组北大西洋集团。这标志着法国反美斗争进入了从根本上打击美国霸权的新阶段。
    美元是美国对外进行经济扩张和政治控制的主要武器之一。近几年来美元日益贬值，但是美国仍然利用它作为主要国际储备货币的地位，在西欧各国大量投资，占领那里的市场。于是法国就利用它近年来国际收支有顺差、黄金外汇储备增加的有利条件，用美元兑换黄金。在法国带动下，其它西欧国家也群起效尤。这就使美国黄金流失大为增加。在美国去年流失的十六亿五千万美元黄金中，法国用美元兑换的就占了一半。在这种情况下，美元的地位又进一步动摇了。除此而外，法国还加紧限制美国对法国的投资，拖延“肯尼迪回合”谈判，在经济上打击美国。
    在北大西洋公约组织的问题上，法国也对美国发动了攻势。北大西洋集团是美国在“军事一体化”名义下控制它的西方盟国、称霸西欧的主要工具。几年以来，法国由于它所提出的改组这个联盟以提高法国地位的要求未能实现，早就采取了各种抗拒和不合作的措施。美国对西欧实行核控制的“多边核力量”计划，一直受到法国的抵制和其它西欧国家的冷遇，已经在去年年初被迫暂时搁置起来。麦克纳马拉在去年五月份提出了在集团里设立“核特别委员会”、给西德以使用核力量的发言权的主张，也同样陷于失败。不仅如此，从去年下半年开始，法国乘美国深陷侵越战争泥潭之机，一再提出了要求彻底改组北大西洋集团的主张。一家接近官方的法国《外交政策》杂志透露，法国主张把北大西洋集团改变为双重联盟：由西欧国家自己成立内部联盟，然后才在完全平等基础上同美国结成联盟。西方报刊还传说，法国主张西欧各国分别同美国订立双边同盟来代替北大西洋公约。二月二十一日，法国总统戴高乐在记者招待会上重申要求修改北大西洋公约，从美国控制下的北大西洋集团收回法国主权，并且强调法国要保持自主，不被美国拖入战争。法国如此一再要求彻底改组北大西洋集团的目的，是要结束美国对西欧的控制，而由法国执西欧之牛耳。这就不可避免地使本来已濒于瓦解的北大西洋集团进一步分崩离析。尽管美国对法国的这些行动大为恼火，但由于陷身南越，处境狼狈，无法采取有力的反击行动。
    西德同美国的关系并不美满
    西德近年来一直利用美法矛盾，一面亲美抑法、一面联法抗美，左右逢源，提高自己的地位。艾哈德上台后，依靠美国的一面成为西德外交政策的主导面。但是，由于西德经济实力几年来已跃居资本主义世界第二位，因而它也并不甘心屈居于在政治上和军事上受人控制的地位。西德《波恩评论》去年年中就抱怨说：西德同美国的联盟“虽然提供了相对的安全”，但“也给波恩的政策缚上了锁链”。
    从经济上说，西德一向就是西欧市场上美国的主要竞争对手。美国资本的大举入侵西欧，一直使西德垄断资本感到不安。西德经济部长施穆克就曾公开抨击美国人“按目前的美元牌价，用一半的价钱购买欧洲企业”。西德的一些企业早已用加紧合并和集中等办法来对付美国对西欧市场的入侵。在货币问题上，西德采取了同法国一致的立场，一面用大量美元向美国兑换黄金，一面要求改革现行以美元为主的国际货币制度。
    在政治上，西德尽管奉行亲美的外交政策，主张建立一个由美国为领导而让西德占优势的“大西洋欧洲”；但是它的战略目标却是抑制法国、驾凌英国，争取同美国平起平坐。目前，西德已经开始在北大西洋集团中要求取得“平等伙伴”的地位。西德外交部长施罗德去年五月公开表示，西德已为北大西洋集团提供了大量军队和费用，但在集团的领导机构中的“共同决定权却极为不够”。在西德统治集团内部代表联法一派的前国防部长施特劳斯更是大声叫嚷：北大西洋公约组织的改组是迫不及待的，否则西德就有可能退出。他还提出了一个“欧洲统一”的蓝图，主张成立以英、法、西德为基础的未来“欧洲合众国”，以便在美国之外建立起“西方防务共同体的第二个支柱”。当然，由于西德目前还需要依靠美国来提高自己的地位，在相当的时期内，这种矛盾还不致于使它改变以亲美为主的外交路线。
    核武器问题，是美国和西德的关系中比较突出的一个问题。西德一直担心美国由于要同苏联达成秘密交易而推迟了以核武器武装西德的时间表，最近它利用美国急需西德支持的困难处境，向美国索讨更急。艾哈德、施罗德一再表示，“西德有权在联盟内解决核武器问题”。但是，不久前艾哈德访美时，两国的会谈公报只是笼统地提到让西德有权“适当地参加”核防务，美国并没有对西德许下什么诺言。核武器是美国控制西德的一张王牌，再加上美国急于同苏联再做成一笔核交易，因而美国对于让西德染指核武器的时间和方式，需要由本身的利益来决定。而对西德来说，突破核控制是争取大国地位的一个重要关键，也是当前迫不及待的一个要求。因此，两国在核武器问题上的分歧将日益表面化。
    至于西欧其它一些国家，如英国和意大利，由于经济困难以及在政治上有求于美国，因此在外交上不能不采取追随美国、靠拢美国的做法。但是，在抵制美国资本渗透和反对美元霸权地位等问题上，它们同美国之间的矛盾也有所发展。
    西欧国家之间矛盾错综复杂
    在西欧内部，各国之间的矛盾表现得更为错综复杂。其中法国和西德的关系，在过去一年来特别尖锐。
    法国和西德过去通过条约建立的所谓“巴黎—波恩轴心”，原是一种势交利合的联盟：两国都要利用对方，使自己夺取西欧霸权。一九六三年十月艾哈德执政以来，西德和法国的关系就日益冷淡。去年，两国围绕西德染指核武器问题和建立西欧政治联盟问题展开了激烈斗争。西德伙同意大利、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡四国，坚持以逐步加强“共同市场”的“超国家”性质，作为同法国就“农业共同基金”（主要用以补贴法国的农业）问题作出规定的交换条件，从而挑起了“共同市场”成立以来最严重的一次危机。
    在“共同市场”危机持续发展的同时，戴高乐提出了德国问题“欧洲化”的倡议，主张“德国统一”问题和德国边境问题都由邻近的欧洲国家协商解决，不要美国插手；而法国同苏联的关系也日益接近。这就更加引起了西德的严重不安。戴高乐还对美国坚决表示，不能容忍西德染指核武器，对于西德参加“核特别委员会”也表示反对。不久前，戴高乐在竞选演说中还意味深长地说：“德国（西德）在演变。我们绝对不知道它的野心将朝那个方向发展。自然，我们希望它朝着正确的方向”。这几句话透露了法国对西德的顾忌之深。
    西德和法国为了使自己在斗争中居于有利的地位，双方都对英国进行拉拢。戴高乐不仅作了一百八十度的大转弯，开始许诺英国有朝一日可以加入“共同市场”，而且法英在“协和”式喷气运输机制造方面，继续进行了密切合作。西德外长施罗德也访问了英国，据传两国还订有定期举行协商的密约。美国乘机策动英国设法挤进“共同市场”，压制法国。这就进一步扩大了法国和西德之间的裂痕。
    可是，法国和西德之间的矛盾尽管十分尖锐，两国无论在经济和政治上都还有互相依存的一面。经济上，两国对“共同市场”的依赖日益加深：法国出口的百分之三十九，西德出口的百分之三十六，都是输往“共同市场”。政治上，“共同市场”也是它们借以增强自己实力地位，向美、英或其他对手进行斗争或讨价还价的本钱。特别是在法美矛盾尖锐化、西德和美国的矛盾也在发展的今天，法国和西德在双方的关系中更需要留有余地。“共同市场”危机在经过了七个月的长期僵持后，今年一月底，西德同意、荷、比、卢四国又向法国让步，达成了妥协。接着艾哈德又在“友好”气氛中访问了巴黎。这表明两国还准备互相利用，关系一时也不会破裂。
    英国的经济实力日益削弱，外交政策到处碰壁，国际地位进一步下降，在西欧政治舞台上已经处于一个配角的地位。目前，虽然它利用法国和西德的矛盾，捞到了一些实惠，企图重新插手西欧事务。但是，由于它进一步依附美国，忙于应付亚洲的“大动乱”，以维护其海外利益，因而不可能在欧洲有多大的作为。
    在帝国主义大国的角逐中，西欧一些小国处境困难，离心倾向进一步发展。据西方报纸透露，一些北欧国家已在酝酿北大西洋集团垮台后自立门户，组织地区性的集团。
    帝国主义阵营正进一步分化
    帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾虽然错综复杂，一面进一步四分五裂，一面又呈现“合纵连横”的势态。但是，美国同西欧国家之间的控制和反控制的斗争始终是其中的主要矛盾。尽管目前有些国家看来还是美国的“忠实的小伙计”，但是摆脱美国控制的要求在这些国家还是在滋长着。甚至象英国，对美国虽然依附如此之深，英国垄断资本的代言人《金融时报》还提出过在“英法合作”基础上联合行动以对付美苏共谋的主张。特别是目前，美帝国主义正在把它的“全球战略”的重心逐步从欧洲转移到亚洲。它除了同苏联领导人加紧勾结在“稳定”欧洲局面以外，还力图迫使西欧国家增加常规兵力驻守西欧。这进一步加剧了美国同西欧国家的矛盾。目前，美国政府竭力寻求西欧盟国支持它在越南和印度支那扩大侵略战争的政策。但是，法国在越南问题上有它自己的一套主张，其他国家对美国的要求也都表示冷淡，甚至西德和英国也不热心在军事上提供支持。今后，美国把更多力量投入亚洲，必然要削弱它对西欧的控制。随着美国在亚洲推行侵略遭到更多的挫折，特别是在侵越战争中遭到越来越大的失败，西欧国家势必将利用美国的困境，加强它们反抗美国的斗争。最后，帝国主义阵营内部必然要“天下大乱”，出现剧烈的分化和重新组合。而对美国来说，当它的“盟主”地位彻底崩溃的时候，就必然会出现“树倒猢狲散”，“墙倒众人推”的局面。
