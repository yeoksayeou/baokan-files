　　Railway Vehicle Application of Modern Paint Spraying Technology
　　China Successfully Manufactures Large-Scale Electrostatic Painting Equipment
    After initial use, spraying efficiency is high, quality is good, paint is saved, and the working conditions of paint workers can be fundamentally improved.
    Recently, a large-scale electrostatic painting equipment for railway vehicle painting was successfully researched and manufactured at the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Factory of the Ministry of Railways.
    Electrostatic painting uses a high-speed rotating paint cup with a high-voltage electric field to throw out the paint. This causes the atomized paint molecules to become negatively charged and the surface of the workpiece to become positively charged. Using the principle of positive and negative electricity attracting each other, the paint is quickly and evenly sprayed onto the workpiece. Electrostatic painting is a new technology for modern paint spraying.
    The newly manufactured large-scale electrostatic painting equipment, after initial use, has higher efficiency, better quality, and saves more paint than using backward spray guns and brushes for vehicle painting. In particular, because the paint mist is charged and cannot stay in the air, the working conditions of paint workers can be fundamentally improved. Now, a painter can complete the painting of a freight car in less than an hour by pressing a button in the control room, whereas in the past it took twelve people two hours to complete by manual brushing.
    During the research and manufacturing of large-scale electrostatic painting equipment, the relevant technical personnel and workers of the Qiqihar Rolling Stock Factory studied Chairman Mao's work "Serve the People," overcoming the "large-area electrostatic spraying does not exist domestically, nor can it be found in foreign materials, we have no way to start" mentality of some people who felt nothing could be accomplished. The staff studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," establishing the revolutionary will of not being afraid of hardship or difficulty. Without materials, they repeatedly experimented in practice. Without equipment, they built it themselves; without materials, they found them themselves. In this way, in just three months, after hundreds of experiments, they finally successfully trial-produced this equipment. (Attached picture)

　　铁路车辆运用现代油漆喷涂新技术
　　我国制造成功大型静电喷漆设备
    经过初步使用，喷涂效率高、质量好、省油漆，可以从根本上改善油漆工人的劳动条件
    最近，一台用于铁路车辆油漆喷涂的大型静电喷漆设备，在铁道部齐齐哈尔车辆工厂研究制造成功。
    静电喷漆就是利用很高转速并带有高压电场的喷油杯，把油漆甩出去，使雾化的油漆分子带上负电，工作物表面带上正电，利用正负电互相吸引的作用，使油漆迅速而均匀地喷到工作物上。静电喷漆是现代油漆喷涂的新技术。
    新制成的这台大型静电喷漆设备，经过初步使用，比用落后的喷枪和刷子进行车辆油漆喷涂效率高、质量好、省油漆，特别是由于油雾带电，不能在空气中停留，可以从根本上改善油漆工人的劳动条件。现在，一个油漆工人在操纵室里一按电钮，不到一个小时就可以完成一辆货车的喷漆工作，而过去用人工涂刷得十二个人用两个小时才能完成。
    齐齐哈尔车辆工厂的有关技术人员和工人们，在研究、制造大型静电喷漆设备当中，七学毛主席著作《为人民服务》，克服了部分人存在的“大面积静电喷漆国内没有，在外国资料上也找不到，我们根本没有门”的无所作为的思想；职工们三学《愚公移山》，树立起不怕苦、不怕难的革命意志。没有资料，他们就到实践中反复试验。没有设备就自己造，没有材料自己找。就这样，仅仅花了三个月的时间，经过几百次试验，终于试制成功这台设备。（附图片）
