    US Military’s "Operation Masher" Gets Mashed

    The Most Frightening Moment
    The *New York Times* published a report on February 2nd from its war correspondent in An Thai village, Binh Dinh province, which stated:
    Today (January 31st), a small squad of Americans – soldiers from the First (Air Cavalry) Division – experienced the most frightening moment of their lives here.
    A company arrived at the edge of this sandy area. At first, there was just a "ping" sound – a sniper's shot (from the Viet Cong). Then, as if on signal, the sound of automatic weapons firing erupted from the woods on the other side of the sandy area.
    The 150 men of this company suddenly threw themselves to the ground. They then began to crawl towards the trees, firing their weapons, cursing, yelling, and reporting on their radios that men had been hit, requesting assistance.
    By the time they had crawled the 300 yards from where they were to the woods, the company had suffered significant losses. Several platoon leaders had fallen, as well as radio operators and riflemen. One platoon, which had forty men when it set out that day, had twenty-three killed or wounded by three o'clock that afternoon.
    The company commander, Captain Eugene Fox of Washington, set up his command post in a thatched hut and began to assess the damage. Suddenly, two 60mm mortar shells landed in the area. One hit the hut directly, and four more men were hit.

    The Trench Became a Cemetery
    The *New York Times* published another report on January 30th from its war correspondent, datelined January 29th from An Thai, South Vietnam, which stated:
    The bodies of American soldiers, some covered with ponchos, half-buried in the sand, lay in a long, winding trench, where they had been killed. Wounded soldiers lay on stretchers under the shade of nearby palm trees.
    An American unit, C Company of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, suffered heavy casualties under fire from (Liberation Army) snipers and machine gunners.
    Eight soldiers from A Company of the same battalion were wounded by shrapnel from rockets fired by American helicopters. And a ninth soldier had his left hand broken by a stray machine gun burst from another American helicopter.
    The soldier who was hit by the machine gun said: "I don't know what happened. They started shooting at me like a bunch of wild animals."
    Yesterday's battle began when C Company's strength was being gathered in a 1,000-yard-long banana-shaped landing zone, under heavy ground fire that was directed at the helicopters. Platoons and squads were mixed up, and the commander lost control of the situation.
    At 9:30 a.m., the mortar platoon leader was killed, his unit began to disintegrate, and more people were injured.

    The Brigade Commander Almost Lost His Life
    A United Press International dispatch from Phu Cat on February 2nd stated:
    A small squadron of rocket-equipped helicopters was prepared to fire in support of the First Cavalry Division, which was carrying out Operation Masher. Ground observers instructed the helicopters to fire 2.75-inch rockets at a plume of yellow smoke that would soon rise into the air, marking the enemy's position.
    At that moment, Colonel Harold Moore, commander of the 3rd Brigade of the First Cavalry Division, and his 1st Battalion were walking below. As Moore, his sergeant major, and a radio operator passed through the bushes, a smoke grenade fell off the radio operator's belt and exploded. As a plume of yellow smoke rose into the sky, the personnel in the area were stunned.
    Suddenly, they were surrounded by the rumble and explosions of rockets fired by the helicopters. The dust settled, and the smoke dissipated. Moore was not injured. But the rockets struck other American soldiers.

### 美军“捣碎机攻势”被捣碎

专栏：外论摘要

    美军“捣碎机攻势”被捣碎
    最怕人的时刻
    《纽约时报》二日刊登的它的战地记者从平定省安太村发出一篇报道说：
    今天（一月三十一日），一小队美国人——第一（空中机动）骑兵师的士兵——在这里度过了他们有生以来最怕人的时刻。
    一个（美军）连开到了这片沙地的边缘上。最初只是啪的一声响——（越共）狙击手的射击声。接着，好象是有信号指挥似的，从这片沙地的另一边的树林里响起了自动武器开火的哒哒声。
    这个连的一百五十人猛然卧倒在地上。他们然后开始往树边爬去，用他们的武器射击，咒骂，吼叫，在他们的无线电上说他们有人中弹，要求援助。
    等到他们爬过从他们那里到树林的三百码距离时，这个连已经遭受了重大损失。几个排长倒下了，无线电报务员、步枪手也倒下了。有一个排在这天出发的时候有四十个人，到这天下午三点钟已经有二十三人被打死或打伤。
    连长、华盛顿人尤金·福克斯上尉在一所茅屋子里设立了他的指挥部，开始清点一下损失。突然之间，两发六十毫米的迫击炮弹落在这个地方。有一发直接打中了这所茅屋，又有四个人给打着了。
    堑壕成了停尸场
    《纽约时报》一月三十日刊登的它的战地记者一月二十九日发自南越安太的另一篇报道说：
    美国兵的尸体，一部分掩覆着披肩，半埋在沙土里，躺在一条很长的弯弯曲曲的堑壕里，他们就是在那里被打死的。伤兵躺在附近棕榈树荫下的担架上。
    一支美国部队，第七骑兵团第二营C连在（解放军）狙击兵和机关枪手的火力下遭受严重伤亡。
    同一个营A连的八名士兵被美国直升飞机发射的火箭弹片打伤了。而第九个士兵被另一架美国直升飞机乱开的机关枪打断了左手。
    被机关枪打中的这位士兵说：“我不知道怎么回事。它们象一群狂野的动物一样开始向我射击。”
    昨天的战斗是在直升飞机受到密集的地面炮火的射击下，在一千码长的香蕉形降落地区，把C连的力量集合起来的时候开始的。各排和各班混杂在一起，指挥员就失去了对局势的控制。
    上午九时三十分，迫击炮排的排长被打死了，他的部队开始瓦解，又有一些人受伤。
    旅长几乎丧了命
    合众国际社二月二日自蓬山发出的一条消息说：
    一小队有火箭装备的直升飞机准备好进行射击以支援开展捣碎机攻势的第一骑兵师。地面观察员通知直升飞机向不久将升入空中的一缕黄烟发射二点七五英寸口径的火箭，这缕黄烟标明敌人的阵地。
    就在这个时刻，第一骑兵师第三旅旅长哈罗得·穆尔上校和他的第一营正在下面行走。当穆尔、他的军士长和无线电联络员穿过灌木丛时，一颗烟幕弹从无线电联络员的皮带上掉了下来，爆炸了。当一缕黄色浓烟升上天空时，这个地区的人员都吓呆了。
    突然，他们周围响起了隆隆声和直升飞机发射的火箭爆炸声。尘土落了下来，烟雾也消散了。穆尔没有受伤。可是火箭打击了其他一些美军。
