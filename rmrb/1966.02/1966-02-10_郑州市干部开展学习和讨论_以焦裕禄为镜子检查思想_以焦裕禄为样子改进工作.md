    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th. The day after the "People's Daily" published "The Example of a County Party Secretary – Jiao Yulu," the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China held a standing committee meeting to discuss the issue of learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu. At the meeting, the lengthy "People's Daily" article and editorial were read, and Jiao Yulu's deeds deeply moved all members of the Standing Committee, with many shedding tears. During the discussion, they expressed their determination to earnestly learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu. The Standing Committee also decided to call on all Party members and cadres in the city, especially leading cadres at all levels, to earnestly study Jiao Yulu's proletarian revolutionary spirit of not seeking fame or fortune, not fearing hardship or death, wholeheartedly serving the revolution, and completely and thoroughly serving the people.
    According to the decision of the Municipal Party Committee, all organs and schools in Zhengzhou launched study and discussions. During the discussions, many comrades used Jiao Yulu as a mirror to conduct preliminary self-examinations. Wang Mingwu, Secretary of the Party Committee of Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Mill No. 4, had already read the "The Example of a County Party Secretary – Jiao Yulu" article and the "People's Daily" editorial on the night of the 8th. During the discussion, he examined himself, saying: "Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, I feel a great gap. In order to change the impoverished face of Lankao, Comrade Jiao Yulu faced strong winds and torrential rain, waded through sand and water, went deep among the masses, and conducted investigations and research. He had only been in Lankao for a little over a year, but he had almost visited all one hundred and several dozen production brigades in the county. And I have been transferred to Mill No. 4 for more than half a year, and although I talk about staying at a fixed point, I haven't really done it yet. In fact, compared to a county, the factory area is so much smaller, but our leading cadres rarely go deep into the workshops; sometimes after finishing a meeting in the evening, they are unwilling to take a stroll through the workshop. When I think of Comrade Jiao Yulu often worrying about the people of the entire county late at night, I feel ashamed." Zhang Yuquan, Secretary of the Supervisory Committee of this factory, who fought guerrillas in Lankao County during the Anti-Japanese War, said: "Lankao County was a sandy wasteland back then. After Comrade Jiao Yulu was transferred to Lankao, he suffered from severe liver disease, but he endured the pain and led the people of Lankao in hard struggle, breaking through numerous difficulties and forging a path, initially changing the face of Lankao. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, what is a little illness of mine? In the past, I considered my own health too much and rarely went to the workshops, which was really wrong." After the discussion, Zhang Yuquan immediately went to the weaving preparation workshop to study the issue of increasing production and practicing economy with the veteran workers.
    A large number of cadres concentrated in the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee preparing to go down to support agriculture also studied Jiao Yulu's deeds. Many people expressed that this time when going to the countryside, they must learn Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, enduring great hardship and hard work, and be determined to dedicate everything to changing the face of the countryside.

    郑州市干部开展学习和讨论
    以焦裕禄为镜子检查思想
    以焦裕禄为样子改进工作
    新华社郑州九日电　《人民日报》发表《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》的第二天，中共郑州市委召开常委会讨论向焦裕禄同志学习的问题。会上宣读了《人民日报》发表的长篇通讯和社论，焦裕禄的事迹使全体常委深受感动，不少人为之流泪。讨论中，纷纷表示要认真地向焦裕禄同志学习。常委会还决定号召全市党员和干部，特别是各级领导干部，认真学习焦裕禄不图名、不图利、不怕苦、不怕死、一心一意为革命、完全彻底为人民的无产阶级革命精神。
    根据市委的决定，郑州市各机关、学校都展开了学习和讨论。讨论中，不少同志以焦裕禄作镜子初步检查了自己。郑州国棉四厂党委书记王鸣梧八日夜里就阅读过《县委书记的榜样——焦裕禄》这篇通讯和《人民日报》的社论。讨论中，他检查自己说：“与焦裕禄同志相比感到差距很大。焦裕禄同志为改变兰考的贫困面貌，迎着疾风暴雨，跋沙涉水，深入群众，调查研究。他到兰考才一年多时间，几乎跑遍了全县一百几十个生产大队。而我调到四厂半年多了，口说蹲点，到现在也没有蹲下去。其实，比起一个县来，工厂范围才多大，可是，我们领导干部深入车间很差，有时晚间开完会就不愿到车间去转一转。一想到焦裕禄同志常常在深夜还为全县人民操心，我就感到惭愧。”抗日战争时期在兰考县打过游击的这个厂的监委书记张玉全说：“当年的兰考县是一片沙荒。焦裕禄同志调到兰考后，身患严重肝病，却隐忍病痛，领导兰考人民艰苦奋斗，硬是冲破重重困难，闯出了一条道路，初步改变了兰考面貌。与焦裕禄同志对比，我有点小病又算得了什么。过去我多考虑自己身体，很少下车间，实在不应该。”讨论后，张玉全立即到织布准备车间，和老工人一起研究开展增产节约的问题。
    集中在郑州市委准备下去支援农业的大批干部，也学习了焦裕禄事迹，不少人表示，这次下乡一定要学焦裕禄全心全意为人民、吃大苦耐大劳的那种革命精神，决心为改变农村面貌献出自己的一切。
