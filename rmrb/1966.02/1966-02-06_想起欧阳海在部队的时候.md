    Having read "The Song of Ouyang Hai," and thinking about what he did in the army, I am truly moved.
    I joined the army with him, and we were in the same unit, often spending time together. I also attended the memorial service held in Hengshan after his sacrifice. He came from a poor peasant background, with deep-seated bitterness and hatred. Under the Party's education, he deeply understood the meaning of revolution, his revolutionary will was very firm, he worked actively and diligently, endured hardship and hard work, lived a simple and frugal life, and was particularly concerned about his comrades. When stationed in a certain place to participate in construction projects, his hands developed many blisters, but he never complained, and his enthusiasm grew even stronger. He worked during the day and also worked overtime at night. He would pick up discarded masks that others had broken and no longer wanted, and use them to mend his clothes. On holidays and Sundays, when the soldiers were resting or going out, he always stayed behind and washed all the clothes, shoes, and socks that the soldiers had taken off, neatly folded them, and stored them for his comrades. Some soldiers returned from outside and were surprised to find that their clothes, shoes, and socks were missing. It turned out that Ouyang Hai had washed them clean, folded them, and stored them for them, which moved the comrades deeply. After standing guard and handing over his shift at night, he would also help the soldiers wash their clothes. He cherished weapons more than his own life, and he always wiped the guns and cannons spotlessly clean. Sometimes, when he didn't have cloth to wipe the cannons, he would tear off pieces of his own clothes, and he wouldn't stop until he had wiped the guns and cannons clean. He could also proactively examine his mistakes in his work and correct them promptly. Because of his good thinking and active work, he was awarded merit three years in a row and was rated as a "Five-Good Soldier."
    Whenever I encounter difficulties in my work, when I think of Ouyang Hai's revolutionary spirit, my enthusiasm immediately increases, and it's as if the difficulties have disappeared.

    想起欧阳海在部队的时候
    欧阳增家
    看了《欧阳海之歌》，联想他在部队里所做的事，确实感到动人。
    我是和他一起参军的，在部队里又是同一个单位，经常相处在一起，他牺牲后部队在南岳开的追悼会我也参加了。他是贫农出身，苦大仇深，在党的教育下，深刻地懂得了革命的意义，革命意志非常坚决，工作积极肯干，吃得苦、耐得劳，生活艰苦朴素，对同志特别关心。在某地驻防参加修建工程的时候，手上打出了很多泡，他从来没叫苦，而且干劲越来越大，白天干了晚上还加班。别人用坏了丢掉不要的口罩，他就拣起来补衣服。假日、星期天，战士们都休息或上街，他总是留在家里，把战士们换下来的衣服鞋袜，通通洗得干干净净、折好后帮同志们收藏起来。有的战士出外回来，看到自己的衣服鞋袜不见了，感到很惊奇，原来是欧阳海帮他洗干净折好收藏了，同志们都很感动。晚上他站岗放哨交班以后，也帮战士们洗衣服。他爱护武器，胜于爱护自己的生命，枪炮时时刻刻擦得干干净净，有时擦炮没布，就把自己的衣服撕下来，不把枪炮擦好不放手。在工作上有错误，也能主动地检查，及时改正，由于他思想好、工作积极，连续三年立功评为五好战士。
    当我工作上有困难的时候，一想起欧阳海的革命精神，干劲马上就大起来，好象困难都不见了。
