　　According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Pyongyang on the 18th, South Korean puppet "President" Park Chung-hee, under the direction of his American masters, visited "Malaysia," Thailand, and Taiwan from February 7th to 18th, attempting to cobble together an aggressive military alliance for U.S. imperialism, serving the United States in further expanding its war of aggression in Southeast Asia. He returned to Seoul on the afternoon of the 18th.

　　According to South Korean radio broadcasts, Park Chung-hee, even before this trip, undisguisedly announced that his goal was to "regard Southeast Asia as the first line of security" and to "actively seek the security and peace of this region." He also said that "the Vietnam War is the common responsibility of the free camp in Southeast Asia," and indicated that he would "promote the holding of a Southeast Asian foreign ministers' conference and a summit conference," etc.

　　According to Western news agencies, Park Chung-hee plans to hold a conference of "free Asian leaders" in Seoul in the middle of this year. In addition to South Korea, he intends to invite South Vietnam, Thailand, "Malaysia," the Philippines, Japan, and the Chiang Kai-shek group to participate. In the joint communique issued by Park Chung-hee and Chiang Kai-shek on the 18th, both sides "agreed to hold high-level meetings and, when necessary, to hold high-level meetings with other free Asian countries." According to the South Korean Hapdong News Agency, Park Chung-hee and the Prime Minister of Thailand "agreed to promote the convening of the highest-level Asian conference" and believed that "convening such a conference is necessary." This news agency also said that in March, "a preparatory meeting for the proposed Southeast Asian foreign ministers' conference will be held in Bangkok."

　　Under the direction of his American masters, Park Chung-hee is attempting to drag more Asian puppets into the American war of aggression against Vietnam. In a joint communique issued at the end of his visit to Thailand, he said: "South Korea and Thailand agreed that the assistance provided by the free world to South Vietnam against communist aggression is not only very important for the peace and order of Vietnam, but also for ensuring the national security of other free Asian countries, including their own." His joint communique with Chiang Kai-shek said that assistance to the South Vietnamese puppet clique "is urgently needed." His joint communique with "Malaysian Prime Minister" Rahman also said: "They expressed their support for the efforts of the people of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) to maintain their freedom" and believed that "such support will help restore peace and order in Vietnam."

　　Park Chung-hee, this faithful dog of the United States, also clamored loudly for anti-China and anti-communism. On the 15th, he babbled nonsense in Taiwan, saying that "the tragedies happening in Asia today are all due to the scourge of the Chinese Communists." "To stabilize the situation in Asia," it is necessary to first "drive the communist bandits out of mainland China." He also clamored to "recover" the "lost northern territory" of Korea.

　　美国奴仆朴正熙要当反华急先锋
　　到台湾勾结蒋帮大肆叫嚷反华反共，策划召开亚洲反共会议，为美帝拼凑侵略集团效劳
    据新华社平壤十八日电  南朝鲜伪“总统”朴正熙在他的美国主子指使下，于二月七日到十八日访问了“马来西亚”、泰国和台湾，企图为美帝国主义拼凑一个侵略性的军事联盟，为美国进一步在东南亚扩大侵略战争效劳。他已经在十八日下午回到汉城。
    据南朝鲜电台广播，朴正熙在这次出访之前就毫不掩饰地宣布他的目的是“把东南亚作为第一条安全线”，“积极谋求这一地区的安全与和平”。他还说，“越南战争是东南亚自由阵营的共同责任”，并且表示他将要“促成东南亚外长会议和首脑会议的举行”等等。
    据西方通讯社报道，朴正熙策划在今年年中在汉城举行“自由亚洲领导人”会议，除南朝鲜外，他打算邀请南越、泰国、“马来西亚”、菲律宾、日本和蒋介石集团参加。在十八日发表的朴正熙和蒋介石的联合公报中，双方“同意举行高阶层会议，并于必要时，与其他亚洲自由国家举行高阶层会议。”据南朝鲜合同通讯社报道，朴正熙和泰国总理“一致同意促进亚洲最高级会议的召开”，并认为“召开这样的会议是必要的”。这家通讯社还说，三月间“将在曼谷举行拟议中的东南亚外长会议的筹备会”。
    朴正熙在他的美国主子的指使之下，企图把更多的亚洲傀儡拉进美国侵略越南的战争。他在访问泰国结束时发表的联合公报说：“南朝鲜和泰国一致认为，自由世界向南越提供的对付共产党侵略的援助不仅仅对越南的和平和秩序来说十分重要，而且对于确保他们自己的国家在内的自由亚洲的其他国家的民族安全来说也是十分重要的。”他和蒋介石的联合公报说，援助南越傀儡集团“实有迫切的需要”。他和“马来西亚总理”拉赫曼的联合公报也说：“他们表示支持越南共和国（南越）人民维护他们自由的努力”，并且认为“这样的支持将有助于恢复越南的和平和秩序。”
    朴正熙这个美国忠实的走狗还大肆叫嚷反华反共。十五日他在台湾胡说什么“今日亚洲所发生的悲剧，都是由于中共的祸根”。“要安定亚洲的局势”，得首先“从中国大陆把共匪赶走”。他还叫嚷要“收复”朝鲜的“北部失地”。
