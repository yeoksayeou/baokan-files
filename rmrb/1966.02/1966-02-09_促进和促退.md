    Promoting and Retarding

    In the first half of last year, the Food Company and the Pharmaceutical Company under the Qixian County Commercial Bureau in Henan Province both exceeded their purchase and sales plans. The Food Company exceeded its plan by more than 50%, while the Pharmaceutical Company exceeded its plan by 8%. When the county-wide state-owned commercial system was评比 (evaluate, assess, and select the best), there was great disagreement about which company should be rated as an advanced unit.

    Some people advocated rating the Food Company as an advanced unit because they had overfulfilled their purchase and sales plan by a large margin; fulfilling the plan well meant good politics. Others advocated rating the Pharmaceutical Company as an advanced unit. The reason was that although the Pharmaceutical Company's completion of the purchase and sales plan was not as much as the Food Company's, they had done an outstanding job in supporting agricultural production and serving the people's health. They also actively helped production teams develop medicinal material production in a planned way, grasping everything from planting to purchasing, which promoted the development of diversified operations in rural areas. And the Food Company? Although they overfulfilled their purchase and sales plan by a large margin, their political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints were not clear enough, and their support for production work was not well done; in the management of live pigs, they had the idea of emphasizing outward transfer and de-emphasizing local sales, making it very inconvenient for farmers to buy meat. This shows that their political work was not done well.

    The Party General Branch of the County Commercial Bureau held a special meeting to discuss this issue. Everyone believed that politics must be emphasized in the assessment, and if only the amount of plan completion was looked at without considering politics, the direction would be lost. It was unanimously agreed to rate the Pharmaceutical Company as an advanced unit. In this way, the Food Company accepted the lesson of emphasizing business and neglecting politics and earnestly improved its work. The Pharmaceutical Company was encouraged and further emphasized politics. Other departments were also greatly educated.

    Fifty compared to eight, what a disparity. However, the Qixian County Commercial Bureau did not judge heroes solely on the basis of numbers. In this way, they not only correctly placed the ranking in this assessment, but more importantly, they correctly placed the position of politics in the assessment. That is to say, they correctly resolved the issue of whether to emphasize politics or emphasize business in the assessment.

    Assessment is for promotion. Promote what? First of all, we must promote the revolutionization of the thinking of enterprises and workers, promote the implementation of the Party's guidelines and policies, and promote the strengthening of political work. Of course, we must also promote the completion of the purchase and sales plan. However, the completion of the purchase and sales plan must be based on the above points. If we forget the former and do not distinguish between right and wrong, only assess the numbers of plan completion, the result will be to encourage the purely business viewpoint of some cadres, and even encourage them to disregard policies and resort to any means in business management in order to overfulfill the plan. In short, it is to encourage capitalist ideas. How can this be promotion? It can only be said to be retarding!

    We are carrying out a socialist revolution, and we are promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology on all fronts. This is the key to all work. In doing any work, we must consider how to meet this requirement. If it meets the requirement, it is promotion; otherwise, it is retarding. If we do not ask about politics, and whoever sells the most money is advanced, wouldn't it become putting numbers in command, where is there any political command?

### 促进和促退

    促进和促退
    去年上半年，河南省淇县商业局所属食品公司和医药公司，都超额完成了购销计划。食品公司超额百分之五十多，医药公司超额百分之八。在全县国营商业系统评比的时候，把哪个公司评为先进单位，大家意见很不一致。
    有人主张把食品公司评为先进单位，因为他们购销计划超额完成得多；计划完成得好，就说明政治好。另外一些人主张把医药公司评为先进单位。理由是：医药公司完成购销计划虽然不象食品公司超额那么多，可是，他们在支援农业生产和为人民健康服务方面，工作做得出色。他们还积极帮助生产队有计划地发展药材生产，从种植到收购一抓到底，促进了农村多种经营的发展。而食品公司呢？他们完成购销计划虽然超额较多，但是政治观点、生产观点和群众观点不够明确，支持生产的工作做得不好；在生猪经营中，有重向外调、轻当地销的思想，农民买肉很不方便。这说明他们的政治工作没有做好。
    县商业局党总支专门开会讨论了这个问题。大家认为，评比中一定要突出政治，如果光看计划完成的多少，而不看政治，就会迷失方向。一致同意把医药公司评为先进单位。这样，食品公司接受了重业务、轻政治的教训，认真改进了工作。医药公司受到了鼓舞，进一步突出了政治。其他部门也受到很大教育。
    五十比八，相差何等悬殊。可是，淇县商业局没有以数字论英雄。这样，他们不仅摆对了这次评比中的名次，更重要的是摆对了政治在评比中的位置。就是说，他们正确地解决了评比中是突出政治还是突出业务的问题。
    评比是为了促进。促进什么？首先要促进企业和职工思想的革命化，促进党的方针政策的贯彻执行，促进政治工作的加强。当然，也要促进完成购销计划。但是，必须以上述几点为前提来完成购销计划。如果忘记了前者，不问青红皂白，只是评比计划完成数字，结果就会助长一部分干部的单纯业务观点，甚至助长在经营管理中为了超额完成计划，不讲政策，不择手段。总之，是助长资本主义思想。这哪儿是促进呢？只能说是促退！
    我们正在进行社会主义革命，正在各条战线上兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想。这是一切工作的纲。做任何工作，都要考虑如何才能符合这一要求。符合的，是促进；反之，则是促退。如果不问政治，谁卖的钱多，谁就先进，岂不成了数字挂帅，哪里还有政治挂帅呢？
