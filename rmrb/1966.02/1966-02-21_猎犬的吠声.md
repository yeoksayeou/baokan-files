Edition: 3

	The South Korean puppet leader Park Chung-hee is scurrying around, serving the United States in its further expansion of its war of aggression in Asia. This American lackey is shouting about how, in order "to stabilize the situation in Asia," it is necessary to "first drive out the commie bandits from mainland China"; he even clamors for "recovering" the "lost northern territories" of Korea.
	
	The hound always runs ahead of its master. People can often know the intentions of its master from the baying of a hound. Park Chung-hee's blatant clamoring shows that he is not a well-trained hound.

    猎犬的吠声
    南朝鲜傀儡头子朴正熙四出奔走，为美国进一步在亚洲扩大侵略战争效劳。这个美国奴仆大喊什么“要安定亚洲的局势”，得首先“从中国大陆把共匪赶走”；还叫嚷要“收复”朝鲜的“北部失地”。
    猎犬总是跑在主人的前面的。人们往往从猎犬的吠声，就可以知道它的主人的意向。朴正熙如此露骨的叫嚣，说明它并不是一条训练有素的猎犬。
