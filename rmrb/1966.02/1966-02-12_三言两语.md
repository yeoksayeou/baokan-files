    A Few Words

    A Way Out and a Dead End
    American diplomatic "authority" Kennan testified in the Senate, saying that the United States has "no pleasant way out" of the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    This "authority" has some insight. The United States today has only one way out: to get out of South Vietnam as soon as possible. This only way out is indeed "unpleasant" for the ruling group in Washington. However, if American imperialism has a way out but refuses to take it, and insists on drilling deeper into the quagmire, then its dead end will certainly be much more "unpleasant."

    Absurd and Ridiculous
    British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Walston said in a debate: "As long as the Chinese do not cross their own borders, Britain will do everything in its power to help their economic and cultural progress."
    This is simply nonsense.
    We have repeatedly said that the Chinese people will not commit aggression against others. At the same time, we have also said that if others impose war on us, we will take all means to defeat the enemy, and then there will be no boundaries to the war. Therefore, Walston's assumption is absurd in itself.
    As for his "promise," it is even more ridiculous. Walston need not worry about China's economic and cultural progress. If the British gentlemen are idle and flustered, they should take care of their own chaotic economy and increasingly declining culture.

    三言两语
    出路和末路
    美国外交界“权威人士”凯南在参议院作证时说：美国在侵越战争中“没有愉快的出路”。
    这位“权威人士”是颇有见地的。美国今天只有出路一条：趁早滚出南越。这条唯一的出路，对华盛顿的统治集团来说，的确是“不愉快”的。不过，如果美帝国主义有出路不走，硬要更深地往泥潭里钻，那末，它的末路肯定将是“不愉快”得多。
    荒唐和可笑
    英国外交部次官沃尔斯顿在一次辩论时说：“只要中国人不越出他们自己的国界，英国将尽其所能来帮助他们的经济和文化进步。”
    这简直是胡言乱语。
    我们一再说过，中国人民是不会向外侵略的。同时，我们又说过，如果别人把战争强加在我们头上，我们将采取一切手段来打败敌人，那时战争就没有界线了。因此，沃尔斯顿的假设本身就是荒唐的。
    至于他的“许诺”，那就更是可笑了。对于中国的经济和文化进步，沃尔斯顿大可不必操心。英国老爷们如果闲得发慌，最好还是多照顾一下自己家里一塌糊涂的经济和日益没落的文化吧。
