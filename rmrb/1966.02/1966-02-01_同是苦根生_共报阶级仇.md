    The waves, like hands holding each other, surge towards the beach one after another, bringing a rhythmic "whoosh" sound.

    Not long after arriving at the new recruit training regiment, Mai Xiande, watching the sea, felt his heart surge like the waves. He said to Ruan Bingjun, with whom he was taking a walk, "When assignments come, I must request to be transferred to a unit in my hometown of Shantou. I won't go anywhere else!"
      "Why?"
      "Sigh, think about it. Before Liberation, the Japanese devils burned our fishing boat, severely beat my father, and blockaded the port and boats, starving my grandfather to death. The Kuomintang was even more vicious than the Japanese devils. My family, for three generations, has suffered persecution from these robbers. I must avenge my relatives in the place where they were harmed!"
    Soon, the company held a meeting to recall bitterness and denounce the crimes of the US-Chiang clique. Soldiers, one after another, angrily denounced the Japanese devils, the US-Chiang bandits, and the landlord capitalists. How much blood debt do they owe us? Everywhere, from the north to the south, are the crimes they committed, everywhere the blood debts they owe. Listening, Mai Xiande could no longer sit still. He jumped up and said, "Our entire class has suffered. We all grew up from the same bitter roots. I want to avenge the class brothers! My family for three generations has had a blood feud with the enemy. This feud must be avenged, and the class feud even more so!"
    The Party branch organized the study of the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune." The more Mai Xiande read, the more excited he became. Ah, Comrade Bethune was a foreigner. He had absolutely no selfish motives. He regarded the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause and sacrificed his life for the Chinese revolution. What a great spirit of internationalism! But what about himself? In the past, he only thought about avenging his family's grievances, making revolution at his doorstep. Compared to Comrade Bethune, it was like heaven and earth. It seems that he must study Chairman Mao's works more conscientiously, take revolutionary predecessors as examples, earnestly transform himself, and strive to become a true proletarian revolutionary fighter. (Editor's note: Mai Xiande studies "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and connects it with his own thinking, which is good. If you only join the revolution to avenge your family, what if you have no family grievances? Did Bethune come to China to avenge any family grievances? Only wanting to avenge family grievances does not make you a thorough revolutionary. Once the family grievances are avenged and your own life improves, you will forget all about the class brothers around the world who have not yet been liberated. What proletarian internationalism will you have then! Mai Xiande's transformation from wanting to avenge family grievances to wanting to avenge class hatred is a leap forward.)
    The US imperialism expanded the war of aggression against Vietnam, and the so-called "Gulf of Tonkin Incident," which it instigated, occurred. Mai Xiande immediately wrote an application to the Party branch, asking the Party to consider transferring him to the place where the revolution needs him most, determined to contribute everything for the entire Chinese people and the people of the whole world!

    同是苦根生　共报阶级仇
    海浪象手拉着手一般，一排接着一排向沙滩涌来，传来哗哗的有节奏的响声。
    到新兵训练团不久的麦贤得，看着海，心里也象海浪一般起伏着。他对一块散步的阮炳钧说：“将来分配工作，我一定要求调到家乡汕头的部队去，别的地方我不去！”
      “那为什么？”
      “咳，你想想，解放前，日本鬼子烧了我家的渔船，把父亲毒打了一顿，又封港封船，饿死了我祖父。国民党比日本鬼子还狠毒。我一家三代，个个受这些强盗迫害。我一定要在亲人被害的地方为亲人报仇！”
    不久，中队举行了控诉美蒋罪行忆苦大会。战士们一个接一个愤怒地控诉着，日本鬼子，美蒋匪帮，地主老财欠下我们多少血债啊，天南地北，到处有他们犯下的罪行，到处有他们欠下的血债。麦贤得听着听着，再也坐不住了，他跳起来说：“我们整个阶级都有苦，我们都是一条苦根上长大的，我要为阶级兄弟报仇雪恨！我家三代与敌人结下了血海深仇，这个仇要报，阶级仇更要报！”
    党支部组织学习《纪念白求恩》这篇文章，麦贤得越读心里越激动，是啊，白求恩同志是一个外国人，他毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，为中国革命献出了生命，这是多么伟大的国际主义精神啊！可是自己呢，过去光想着报自己的家仇，在家门口革命，这比起白求恩同志来真是差个天上地下。看来，还要更加认真地学习毛主席著作，以革命先辈为榜样，认真改造自己，争取成为一个真正的无产阶级革命战士。（编者插话：麦贤得学习《纪念白求恩》联系自己的思想，联系得好。为报家仇才参加革命，那么没有家仇又怎办呢？白求恩到中国来，难道是为报什么家仇吗？光为报家仇，这不是彻底的革命派，家仇一报，自己光景一好，就会把世界上尚未解放的阶级兄弟通通忘掉，还会有什么无产阶级国际主义！麦贤得从要报家仇到要报阶级仇，是一个飞跃。）
    美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争、一手挑起的所谓“北部湾事件”发生了，麦贤得立即向党支部写了申请书，请党考虑把他调到革命最需要的地方去，决心为全中国人民、全世界人民贡献一切！
