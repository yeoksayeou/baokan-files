　　Serving Production, Serving the Grassroots
　　Liu Jiesheng, Accountant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company
    In the process of realizing the revolutionization of enterprises in our Haicheng Magnesium Mine of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, we vigorously promoted the service of departments to teams and groups and the participation of workers in management from October 1964, which greatly changed the appearance of the entire mine. In the process of revolutionization, the number of accountants in the entire mine was reduced by 63 percent, accounting subjects were reduced by half, and reports were reduced by more than two-thirds, freeing financial accounting personnel from tedious affairs and placing them in positions to serve the teams and groups. Six out of ten people in the entire department became on-site service personnel, going to the teams and groups in shifts every day. Now, the cost can be calculated on a ten-day basis for the group's accounting, which has mobilized the enthusiasm of workers to care about the enterprise's economy.
    From February 1965, I served as an on-site service worker in the mining workshop. In my work, I took some detours and encountered some setbacks, but more importantly, I received a great education and initially established the feelings of the working class, transforming my ideology and work style.

    Correcting the Mistaken Idea of Not Trusting the Masses
    The first obstacle I encountered after becoming an on-site service worker was the ideological distrust of the worker masses. At that time, I thought: It is okay to ask worker administrators to do some simple work, but asking them to do cost accounting is impossible.

    The leadership once asked me to go to the mining workshop to explain accounting methods to the worker accountants and told me, "You can only teach them well, you can't teach them to run away." I thought: Okay, let's try it. I carefully prepared for two nights and started lecturing the workers like a teacher, talking about "total cost," "unit cost," "cost factors," "materialized labor," etc., which took a lot of effort and more than half an hour. When asked how it was, the workers shook their heads. At this time, I thought that the workers were not capable.

    Later, I listened to the head of the accounting section giving a lesson to the workers, and the situation was different. He spoke very plainly, and the workers listened with great interest. I asked again how it was, and the workers all nodded. At that time, I thought that the workers probably saw that he was the head of the section and had to say it was good even if he didn't speak well. At this time, the section organized the study of Chairman Mao's works. From studying the article "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing," I realized that it was not that the workers' level was low, but that my set of "student tones" was incompatible with the workers. When I spoke again, I referred to unit cost as how much money a ton of ore cost, and unit consumption as how much dynamite and detonators were used per ton of ore. When I spoke like this, the workers understood. But at that time, I still lacked confidence in whether I could teach the workers to do accounting. Later, I studied articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" to increase my confidence. If I couldn't teach well in the form of lectures, I adopted the method of teaching one person at a time, teaching on-site during work hours and in the dormitory during leisure time.

    Now, most of the worker accountants have not only mastered the basic knowledge of accounting, but also do a great job in practice. It is much better than when only a few of us did accounting in the past. This profoundly educated me: it is a great mistake not to believe in the wisdom and strength of the worker masses. The worker masses not only have the enthusiasm to manage the enterprise well, but also have the ability to manage the enterprise well. I think that if we don't first correct the mistaken idea of not trusting the masses, we cannot be good on-site service personnel, we cannot talk about serving the masses, and we cannot do anything well.

    Appearing as an Ordinary Laborer
    On-site service personnel should go to the teams and groups to serve production and the workers. Our practice is to go to the teams and groups for work in the morning and return to the section to handle business in the afternoon. But how to go down, in what capacity and attitude, is indeed a big problem.

    In the beginning, although my body went down, the work did not go down. More than thirty groups, walking around in this group and chatting in that group, chatting with the worker accountants for a while, and saying a few words when I met the production team leader, it seemed very lively on the surface, but what was the actual situation? We always felt a wall between each other, and the workers didn't treat me as one of their own. What was the reason for this? After thinking about it, it was because I didn't act according to the teachings of the Party, and didn't appear as an ordinary laborer.

    Later, I often went to the 106 platform group to work. Lu Fengchao, the worker accountant of this group, pushed a cart with another worker. In the past, if I talked to him about accounting business, it would affect the pushing of the cart. This time, I helped them push the cart while talking about work, and sometimes I actively helped them do some odd jobs. In this way, the worker comrades' attitude towards me changed, and the work became easier to carry out. Later, no matter which group I went to, I first helped with work, and then studied accounting work with the worker accountants. In this way, my relationship with the workers became closer, the work also developed, and I also learned a lot of good things from the excellent qualities of the workers, which I used as a driving force for my progress. In July 1965, the worker Jiang Chenggui was sick and hospitalized, and no one claimed his salary. Should I send it to him? At that time, a struggle took place in my mind, and I finally decided to send him the salary. When I delivered the salary to him, he came down from the sickbed with crutches and said to me kindly: Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao will cadres send salaries to workers; in the old society, not only would clerks not send money to workers, but they would not even give money when they were sick. The patients in the same ward also said this. I was very touched at the time. The masses gave me such a high evaluation for doing this little work, and I felt very ashamed. At this time, I truly realized the meaning of serving the masses and strengthened my determination to serve the masses.

    Starting with Ideology in Grasping Business
    After the on-site service personnel go to the teams and groups, is it okay to only grasp business and not ask about ideology? Practice answered this question: no.

    In August 1965, the material costs of Xie Guojin's group exceeded the budget by 50 percent. According to regulations, they could not participate in the evaluation, and the workers were very concerned about this issue. After I learned about it, I ran to participate in their pre-shift meeting the next morning and asked them why they had exceeded the budget. The worker accountant said: Because we didn't do the accounting in time; the material clerk said: We took some materials that we didn't use. I also helped them analyze the reasons for the overrun. Everyone said that they must do the accounting carefully in the future, strictly control expenses, and immediately return the extra materials to the warehouse. In September, their material costs not only did not exceed the budget, but decreased by 50 percent, and in October they decreased even further. From this incident, I realized that if I did not seize the ideological work in early September, and still talked emptily about accounting methods, I would not have achieved such good results.

    To achieve prominence in politics and ideological leadership, we must make ourselves both service personnel and propagandists. Practice tells me that without doing propaganda work, the work cannot be done well. In addition to using the blackboard newspaper to promptly publicize the Party's policies and good people and good deeds, I also carried out oral propaganda. For example, some workers did not sufficiently understand the significance of participating in management, so I spoke a lot about the elimination of the difference between mental and physical labor and the great significance of workers participating in management, so as to increase the workers' enthusiasm for participating in accounting.

    Conscientiously Transforming the Subjective World
    For financial accounting personnel to do a good job as on-site service personnel, the fundamental problem lies in ideological revolution. This requires truly following Chairman Mao's instructions, putting down the airs of cadres, participating in labor, willingly being a primary school student, and conscientiously transforming the subjective world.

    I am forty-eight years old this year and have been an accountant for twenty-six years. When I was an accountant in the old society, I completely served the capitalists and acted according to the capitalists' faces. After liberation, I should be serving the people as an accountant in the new society, but because my old ideas have not been transformed well, I sit in the office all day compiling reports and shaking the computer, and I don't know how to serve the masses; as soon as I finish compiling the reports, I feel relaxed and happy, and I have completed the task. Therefore, in essence, I am serving the reports. Since our mine launched the enterprise revolutionization movement, I have served as an on-site service worker, often serving the teams and groups, working with the workers, and studying the work together, which has made me clearly see the infinite power of the masses in the struggle for production and their sense of responsibility to love the factory as their home. Comparing myself with the worker comrades, I found the gap, improved my understanding, initially overcame non-proletarian ideas, and strengthened my proletarian feelings. At this time, I truly felt that I was serving the masses, serving production, and serving the people.

### 面向生产，为基层服务

　　面向生产，为基层服务
　　鞍山钢铁公司会计　刘洁生
    我们鞍山钢铁公司海城镁矿，在实现企业革命化过程中，从一九六四年十月份起，大力推行了科室服务到班组，工人参加管理，全矿面貌为之大变。在革命化过程中，全矿会计员精简了百分之六十三，会计科目削减了一半，表报精简了三分之二以上，把财务会计人员从烦琐的事务圈子中解放出来，走上了为班组服务的岗位，全科十个人，有六个人当了现场服务员，分区域每天到班组去上岗。现在小组的核算，按旬可以算出成本，调动了工人关心企业经济的积极性。
    我从一九六五年二月起，到采矿车间担任现场服务员工作。在工作中，我走过一些弯路，遇到一些挫折，但更重要的是受到了很大教育，初步建立了工人阶级感情，改造了自己的思想作风。
    纠正不相信群众的错误观念
    我当现场服务员以后，遇到的第一个障碍，就是思想上不相信工人群众。当时我认为：叫工人管理员做些简单的工作还可以，叫他们搞成本核算，根本干不了。
    领导上曾经让我到采矿车间去给工人核算员讲核算方法，并且告诉我：“只能教好，不能教跑”。我想：好吧，试试看吧。我认真地准备了两个晚上，就象当老师一样地给工人讲起来了，什么“总成本”、“单位成本”、“成本要素”、“物化劳动”等等，费了不少劲，讲了半个多钟头。一问怎么样？工人直摇头。这时我想，工人是不行啊。
    后来，我听会计科长给工人讲课，那情形就不一样了。他讲得很通俗，工人听得很起劲。我又问怎么样？工人都点头。我当时认为，大概工人看他是科长，讲得不好也得说好。这时，科里组织学习毛主席著作。从学习《反对党八股》一文中，我认识到不是工人的水平低，而是自己的一套“学生腔”，同工人格格不入。再讲时，我把单位成本说成一吨矿石要多少钱，把单位消耗说成一吨矿石要用多少火药、多少雷管；……这么一讲，工人果然听懂了。但在当时，对能不能教会工人核算，我还是没有信心。以后，我又学习《愚公移山》等文章，增强了信心。用讲课形式教不好，我就采用一个人一个人教的办法，工作时间到现场去教，业余时间到宿舍去教。
    现在绝大部分工人核算员，不但掌握了核算基本知识，而且在实际工作中，也干得很出色，比过去仅仅由我们少数人搞核算好多了。这就深深地教育了我：不相信工人群众的智慧和力量是十分错误的。工人群众不但有着管好企业的积极性，而且完全有管好企业的本领。我想，如果不首先纠正不相信群众的错误观念，就不能当好现场服务员，就谈不到为群众服务，就办不好任何事情。
    以普通劳动者身分出现
    现场服务员要到班组去，为生产服务，为工人服务。我们的做法是上午到班组上岗，下午回科办业务。但是怎样下去，以什么身分和态度下去，确实是一个大问题。
    开始，我的身子虽然下去了，但是工作却没有下去。三十多个小组，这个组走走，那个组串串，见着工人核算员唠一会儿，碰见生产组长说几句，表面上好象也挺热火，可是实际情况又是怎样的呢？我们互相之间，总觉得隔着一堵墙，工人拿我不当自己人。这是什么原因呢？我想来想去，是自己没按党的教导办事，没以普通劳动者身分出现。
    后来，我就经常到一○六平台小组去劳动。这个组的工人核算员吕凤超，同另一位工人合推一辆车，过去，我和他谈核算业务，就要影响推车。这次，我就一边帮他们推车，一边谈工作，有时还主动帮他们干一些杂活。这样，工人同志对我的态度变了，工作也好进行了。以后，我不管到那个组，都首先帮助干活，然后再和工人核算员一道研究核算工作。这样一来，我同工人的感情密切了，工作也开展起来了，我还从工人的优秀品质中学了不少好东西，以此做为我进步的动力。一九六五年七月，工人姜成贵有病住医院，他的工资没人领。给不给他送去呢？当时在我的思想中进行了斗争，最后决定把工资给他送去。当我把工资送到他手里的时候，他从病床上扶着双拐下来，对我亲切地说：只有在共产党和毛主席领导下，干部才会把工资送到工人手里；旧社会不但职员不会给工人送钱，并且有病还不给钱。同病房的病人也这样说。当时使我很受感动。我做这一点工作，群众给我这样高的评价，感到很惭愧。这时，我才真正知道为群众服务的意义，增强了我为群众服务的决心。
    抓业务从抓思想入手
    现场服务员到班组以后，光抓业务，不问思想，行不行呢？实践回答了这个问题：不行。
    一九六五年八月份，谢国金小组的材料费超支了百分之五十，按规定不能参加评比，工人都很关心这个问题。我知道以后，第二天一早就跑去参加了他们的班前会，问他们为什么超支了？工人核算员说：因为我们没有及时核算；材料员说：我们领了一些材料没有用上。我也帮助他们分析了超支的原因。大家表示今后一定要认真核算，严格掌握开支，并且马上把多领的材料退回仓库。九月份，他们的材料费不但没超支，反而降低了百分之五十，十月份又有所降低。从这件事情中，使我认识到：如果九月初不抓紧进行思想工作，还是空空洞洞地讲核算方法，就不会取得这样好的效果。
    要做到突出政治，思想领先，就要使自己既是服务员，又是宣传员。实践告诉我，不做宣传工作，工作是做不好的。我除了利用黑板报，及时宣传党的方针政策和好人好事外，还进行了口头宣传。例如，有些工人对参加管理的意义认识不足，我就大讲消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动差别和工人参加管理的重大意义，这样来增加工人参加核算的劲头。
    认真改造主观世界
    财务会计人员要做好现场服务员的工作，根本的问题在于思想革命。这就要真正按照毛主席的指示，放下干部架子，参加劳动，甘当小学生，认真改造主观世界。
    我今年四十八岁，已经当了二十六年会计了。在旧社会当会计，完全是给资本家服务，看资本家的脸色行事。解放以后，我在新社会当会计，应当是为人民服务的，但是由于自己的旧思想没有改造好，整天坐在办公室编报表，摇计算机，不知道怎样为群众服务；报表一编完，我就感到轻松愉快，完成了任务，因此，实质上是在为报表服务。从我矿开展企业革命化运动以来，我担任现场服务员，经常服务到班组，和工人共同劳动，共同研究工作，使我清楚地看到群众在生产斗争中的无穷力量和爱厂如家的责任心。自己和工人同志对比，找到了差距，提高了认识，初步克服了非无产阶级思想，增强了无产阶级感情。这时，我才真正感到自己是在为群众服务，为生产服务，为人民服务。
