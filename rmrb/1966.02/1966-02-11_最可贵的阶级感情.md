    Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong, profoundly moved the broad masses of cadres and people with his deep class sentiment for the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many county committee comrades on the front lines of rural work felt this especially deeply and personally. The Agricultural and Forestry Political Department, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, the Central-South Bureau, the East China Bureau, and many provincial and municipal committees have issued notices calling for learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu's firm stand of sharing weal and woe with the masses.

    As a loyal servant of the people of Lankao County, Comrade Jiao Yulu took the suffering of the masses as his own and the joy of the masses as his own. The three scourges of waterlogging, sandstorms, and salinization that brought serious disasters to the people of Lankao County were regarded by him as the greatest enemies; the desire of the broad masses to get rid of natural disasters was the sacred cause to which he was determined to devote himself. He had the entire people of Lankao County in his heart, and only himself was missing.

    For a Communist Party member and a revolutionary cadre, establishing a communist worldview will result in deep revolutionary class sentiment, treating the broad masses as class brothers and sisters, and relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants in everything in rural work. Comrade Jiao Yulu found the direction for changing the face of Lankao in Comrade Mao Zedong's works, mobilized the leading comrades of the county committee to go deep among the poor and lower-middle peasants to seek advice and treasure; he himself took the lead in eating, living, and laboring with the poor peasants, learning and summarizing the experiences of the masses in fighting against natural disasters. Comrade Jiao Yulu strived to grasp both ends: seriously studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works and closely relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, finally leading the people of the entire county to create the great achievement of changing the face of Lankao.

    In a situation where natural disasters in Lankao County were so severe and the lives of the masses were so difficult, in order to revolutionize nature, it was necessary, as Comrade Mao Zedong taught, to be with the masses, to mobilize their enthusiasm, to care about their pain, and to sincerely seek their interests. This is exactly what Comrade Jiao Yulu did. He appeared before the masses when they were most in difficulty; he earnestly helped the masses when they most needed help. Braving the heavy snow, he visited two old, childless poor peasants, calling himself their son, deeply enabling the two old people to experience the fundamental difference between the old and new societies and to realize that our Party completely and thoroughly represents their interests, and to carry out a resolute struggle in accordance with the direction pointed out by our Party.

    It was precisely with such deep class sentiment that Comrade Jiao Yulu, with selfless spirit, led the people of the entire county of Lankao to throw themselves into the battle of transforming the world. He disregarded all hardships, difficulties, life, death, and pain. It was precisely with such deep class sentiment, standing among the broad masses, that he had the greatest courage, shouldered the heavy burden of work, and forged ahead bravely and pragmatically in the face of serious difficulties.

    With such deep class sentiment, Comrade Jiao Yulu studied Comrade Mao Zedong's works with insatiable desire. With boundless love for the people of Lankao and with a strong desire to quickly change the face of Lankao, he went to Comrade Mao Zedong's works to find direction, find strength, and find methods, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm himself and also to arm the broad masses of cadres and people in Lankao County. This was the most reliable guarantee for the people of Lankao to overcome natural disasters.

    Comrade Jiao Yulu is worthy of being a good student of Comrade Mao Zedong. He has set an example for us that

    最可贵的阶级感情
    毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄同志对贫下中农的深厚的阶级感情，强烈地感动了广大干部和群众。许多处在农村工作第一线的县委同志，感受特别深刻和亲切。农林政治部、解放军总政治部、中南局、华东局和许多省、市委，分别发出通知，号召学习焦裕禄同志这种和群众同呼吸共命运的坚定立场。
    作为兰考县人民群众忠实的勤务员，焦裕禄同志以群众的痛苦为自己的痛苦，以群众的欢乐为自己的欢乐。给兰考县人民带来严重灾难的水、沙、碱三害，被他看作最大的敌人；广大群众渴望摆脱自然灾害的要求，是他决心为之献身的神圣事业。他心里装着兰考县全体人民，唯独没有他自己。
    对于一个共产党员、革命干部来说，树立了共产主义世界观，就会有深厚的革命的阶级感情，就会把广大群众看作自己的阶级弟兄，就会在农村工作中时时事事依靠贫下中农。焦裕禄同志从毛泽东同志的著作中，找到了改变兰考面貌的方向，发动县委领导同志，深入贫下中农求经问宝；他自己带头和贫农同吃同住同劳动，学习和总结群众中对自然灾害作斗争的经验。焦裕禄同志努力抓两头：认真学习毛泽东同志的著作，紧紧依靠贫下中农，终于领导全县人民，创造了改变兰考面貌的伟大业绩。
    在兰考县自然灾害那样深重，群众生活那样困难的情况下，为了革自然的命，必须象毛泽东同志所教导的那样，就得和群众在一起，就得去发动群众的积极性，就得去关心群众的痛痒，就得真心实意地为群众谋利益。焦裕禄同志正是这样做的。他在群众最困难的时候，出现在群众的面前；在群众最需要帮助的时候，认真帮助群众。他冒着漫天大雪，看望两位无儿无女的老贫农，说是他们的儿子，使两位老人深切地体会到新旧社会的根本不同，认识到我们党完全彻底地代表他们的利益，按照我们党指出的方向，进行坚决的斗争。
    正是怀着这样深厚的阶级感情，焦裕禄同志以忘我的精神，领导兰考全县人民投入改天换地的战斗。什么艰难困苦、生死病痛，一概被他置之度外。正是怀着这样深厚的阶级感情，站在广大群众之中，他就有了最大的勇敢，挑起工作的重担，在严重的困难面前，脚踏实地奋勇前进。
    怀着这样深厚的阶级感情，焦裕禄同志如饥似渴地学习毛泽东同志的著作。他带着对兰考人民的无限热爱，带着迅速改变兰考面貌的强烈愿望，到毛泽东同志的著作里找方向、找力量、找办法，用毛泽东思想武装了自己，也武装了兰考县的广大干部和群众，这就是兰考人民战胜自然灾害的最可靠的保证。
    焦裕禄同志不愧为毛泽东同志的好学生。他给我们树立了一个值得全面学习的榜样。学习焦裕禄同志，首先就应当象他那样：带着深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛泽东同志的著作；带着深厚的阶级感情，领导阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动。
