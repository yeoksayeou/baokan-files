    Shanghai, February 11th (Xinhua News Agency) – In Shanghai, Party members, cadres, and the masses on all fronts have been holding discussions and debating the profound education that Comrade Jiao Yulu’s glorious deeds have given them. They all express their determination to emulate Comrade Jiao Yulu, cultivating deep class feelings, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, remaining forever loyal to the Party and the revolution, and playing their greatest role in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment.
    After Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious deeds were published in the newspapers, they received great attention from the people of the city. Everyone believes that Comrade Jiao Yulu's life as a great communist fighter is "a revolutionary living textbook that couldn't be better"; after reading the relevant reports and editorials, "it's like attending a very profound tutorial on the path taken by revolutionaries." Many Party members, cadres, workers, shop assistants, scientific and technical personnel, teachers, and students, with excited hearts, wrote letters to the editorial departments of Shanghai's newspapers, expressing their determination to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu’s spirit of utter devotion to the revolution and wholeheartedly serving the people has caused great shock in the minds of leading cadres at all levels in Shanghai. Xiao Shaohua, Acting Secretary of the CPC Shanghai County Committee, said: "Whether from the perspective of work or from the perspective of ideology and style, there is still a big gap between us and Comrade Jiao Yulu. I myself must make the greatest determination, and we must also lead the cadres of the entire county to learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu." Wang Xishang, Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, said: "In today's deeply developing socialist revolution and vigorously developing socialist construction, I often consider how to persist in continuous revolution and thorough revolution for the rest of my life. This time, in Comrade Jiao Yulu's immortal deeds, I found the key to unlocking this question and understood that only by taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, re-understanding myself, and further transforming my worldview, can I continuously and thoroughly revolutionize for the rest of my life." Wang Wenjing, Deputy Director of the Education and Health Department of the CPC Changning District Committee in Shanghai, said: "Our revolution and construction, and all the achievements we have made, rely on Chairman Mao's thought, and on Comrade Jiao Yulu's example of holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, possessing abundant revolutionary spirit. I am determined to take Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example and learn from Jiao Yulu." Du Jihua, a cadre of the Communist Youth League Committee of the Shanghai China Textile Machinery Factory, stated: "In the long-term ideological transformation in the future," Jiao Yulu is "my ideological 'inspector'." He excitedly said: Comrade Jiao Yulu "radiates the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought." He "is not only a model for county party secretaries, but also a brilliant model for us revolutionary successors." Hou Suosheng, a cadre of the Zhabei District People's Committee of Shanghai, said: The revolutionary predecessors' "thorough revolutionary spirit of 'not resting until the goal is achieved' is a valuable spiritual wealth for our younger generation. We must inherit it and carry it forward."
    What force enabled Comrade Jiao Yulu to create immortal heroic achievements? Many Party members, cadres, and the masses on all fronts in Shanghai believe that it is the great Mao Zedong Thought. Liu Peiyun, a cadre of the Political Department of the Shanghai Chemical Machinery Repair General Factory, said: "After studying Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds, I understand that to serve the people wholeheartedly and completely, and to truly achieve revolutionization, one can only earnestly read Chairman Mao's books, honestly listen to Chairman Mao's words, and conscientiously act according to Chairman Mao's instructions." "In the future, I must learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu, truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and contribute everything I have to the people, the Party, and the revolution."

    上海市广大党员、干部和群众纷纷表示决心
    象焦裕禄那样用毛泽东思想武装自己
    据新华社上海十一日电　上海市各条战线上的党员、干部和群众，这几天纷纷座谈和议论焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹给自己的深刻教育。他们都表示要象焦裕禄同志那样，带着深厚的阶级感情，活学活用毛主席著作，永远忠于党，忠于革命，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，发挥自己最大的作用。
    焦裕禄同志的光辉事迹在报上刊登以后，受到了全市人民的极大重视。大家认为：焦裕禄同志作为伟大的共产主义战士的一生，是“一本再好不过的革命的活的教科书”；读完了有关的报道和社论，“等于上了一堂非常深刻的革命者所走道路的辅导课”。许多党员、干部、工人、店员、科学技术人员和教师、学生，怀着激动的心情，给上海各报编辑部写信，表示自己向焦裕禄同志学习的决心。
    焦裕禄同志忠心耿耿为革命、一心一意为人民的精神，在上海各级领导干部的思想上引起了很大的震动。中共上海县委代理书记萧少华说：“不论从工作上讲，还是从思想上、作风上讲，我们和焦裕禄同志比起来，都还有很大差距。我自己一定要下最大决心，我们也一定要带动全县干部，向焦裕禄同志学习。”中共上海市委组织部副处长王希尚说：“在社会主义革命深入发展，社会主义建设蓬勃发展的今天，我常常考虑后半辈子怎样坚持不断革命、彻底革命这个问题。这次，在焦裕禄同志的不朽事迹中，我找到了开这把锁的钥匙，懂得了只有以毛泽东思想挂帅，活学活用毛主席著作，重新认识自己，进一步改造自己的世界观，才能在后半辈子不断革命、彻底革命。”中共上海市长宁区委教育卫生部副部长王文敬说：“我们搞革命搞建设，一切成绩的取得，都是靠毛主席的思想，靠象焦裕禄同志那样的高举毛泽东思想的红旗，有着充沛的革命精神。我决心以焦裕禄同志为榜样，学焦裕禄。”上海中国纺织机械厂团委干部杜继华表示：“在今后长期的思想改造中”，焦裕禄是“我思想上的‘检验员’”。他激动地说：焦裕禄同志“浑身闪发出毛泽东思想的光芒。”他“不仅是县委书记的榜样，而且是我们革命接班人的光辉榜样”。上海市闸北区人民委员会干部侯锁生说：革命前辈们“这种‘不达目的，死不瞑目’的彻底革命精神，是我们青年一代的宝贵的精神财富。我们一定要继承下来，发扬光大。”
    是什么力量使焦裕禄同志创造了不朽的英雄业绩？上海各条战线上的许多党员、干部和群众认为：是伟大的毛泽东思想。上海化工机修总厂政治部干部刘培云说：“学了焦裕禄同志的事迹，我懂得了要完全彻底地为人民服务，要真正实现革命化，就只有认认真真读毛主席的书，老老实实听毛主席的话，切切实实按照毛主席的指示办事。”“今后我一定要向焦裕禄同志学习，把毛泽东思想实实在在学到手，为人民、为党、为革命贡献出自己的一切。”
