    Guided by Mao Zedong Thought, with profound class hatred, a high degree of combat readiness, not fearing hardship or death, and daring to eliminate all invading enemies – these are the main spiritual qualities of our heroic sailors who participated in the "August 6th Sea Battle" and the "Battle East of Chongwu" last year. These are also the main spiritual qualities of all commanders and fighters of the People’s Liberation Army Navy. The new seven-act play "Song of the Night Sea Battle" by the Haizheng Cultural Troupe Drama Group uses these two sea battles as its backdrop, depicting this spiritual quality of our heroic sailors. A naval fleet, in order to annihilate the enemy's 34.7 flotilla and defend the motherland's coastal defenses, followed Chairman Mao's strategic thinking, chose an ambush waiting point. In this sea battle, they resolutely relied on the masses, displayed the fighting spirit of daring to fight at night and at close quarters, and daring to engage in hand-to-hand combat with bayonets, thus achieving a new victory in naval annihilation warfare. This play publicizes the power of people's war, publicizes the primacy of the human factor, and it inspires the morale of the revolutionary people, arming them spiritually. This play is timely, and this play is excellent!
    The play "Song of the Night Sea Battle" deliberately shapes a group portrait of our heroic sailors. The author places this group of young sailor heroes in relatively simple events such as "waiting for an opportunity," "returning to port," "seeking battle," "attacking," and "complete annihilation" to prominently demonstrate their spiritual world.
    Appearing in "Song of the Night Sea Battle" are the sailors of our era, the soldiers of Mao Zedong. Nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, they have broad minds, high political consciousness, and are united, tense, serious, and lively. The play puts them in the face of severe tests, further demonstrating their spirit of not fearing hardship or death, and praising their revolutionary sentiment of serving the people wholeheartedly and doing everything for the revolution. They went into battle with Chairman Mao's quotations in their pockets, and recited Chairman Mao's poems to heroically kill the enemy. This is the image of our heroic sailors. They are a true portrayal of thousands of Wang Jie-style and Mai Xiande-style heroes in life, and a true reflection of the actual face of our troops.
    Political Instructor Tie Zhenhai of the 878艇 (艇 is a type of smaller warship. I am leaving it as the number) is an image of a naval vessel's political worker. In the midst of stormy waves, when the soldiers' deep-seated hatred for the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang reached its ignition point, he restrained his inner excitement and adhered to Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thinking of people's war, not fighting until the time was right. He was good at using Chairman Mao's poems as political mobilization work. When inspiring people to step out of the perilous path of Wolf Tooth Reef and arranging an ambush site, he enthusiastically recited Chairman Mao's three Sixteen-Character Orders to review the heroic forefathers, express the determination and spirit of the red descendants to bravely take over the baton.
    In addition, Old Grandpa, the fisherman who victoriously fought against Japanese imperialism twenty years ago, is a representative of the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. His appearance is like an important note, making this ode to heroic sailors resound with the high-pitched tones of people's war.
    In depicting conflicts and portraying characters, the play vividly reveals this truth: "For our army, the best weapons are not airplanes, not artillery, not tanks, not atomic bombs, the best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest combat power is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and not afraid of death." Relying on the human factor, relying on politics, relying on people's war, in the past we defeated Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang; then, today, relying on it in the same way, we can beat all enemies who dare to invade to the ground, making them come and never return! The play's theme embodies Chairman Mao's military thinking. At a time when US imperialism is frantically expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam and aiming the spearhead of war at our country, the performance of "Song of the Night Sea Battle" has extremely realistic combat significance; this play is an ode to the greatest combat power, an ode to people's war, an ode to Mao Zedong Thought!
    The performance of "Song of the Night Sea Battle" by the Haizheng Cultural Troupe Drama Group has its own artistic characteristics. The author does not pursue bizarre and tortuous plots, but strives to shape a group portrait of heroic sailors. Although the play also writes about the conflicts caused by differences in ideological level and personality among the soldiers in the struggle to annihilate the enemy's 34.7 flotilla, its main contradiction is still the enemy-us contradiction. Writing about the enemy-us contradiction, while the main opponent is not on stage, is indeed a tricky problem. The author arranged three prisoners of war, like three gaps, from which the audience saw the flight, harassment, and destruction of the 34.7 flotilla. The authors attempted to portray every soldier as a hero, as was the true situation in the two sea battles, without creating any serious opposition among them. Therefore, internal contradictions arise to a measured degree on the premise and basis of a common enemy and a united opposition to the enemy, on the basis that all commanders and fighters have vigorous fighting spirit, high morale to fight, and a spirit of bravery and not fearing death. Because of the common premise and foundation, this kind of conflict will only expose the thoughts of our cadres and soldiers more deeply, more grandly, and more lovingly. In the face of these topics, "Song of the Night Sea Battle" has made very beneficial explorations.
    This is a naval play that writes about the Chinese People's Navy and has the spirit of the Chinese nation, it has a clear banner, a high tone, and a majestic momentum. The Haizheng Cultural Troupe Drama Group is gradually forming its own creative style: in their performances, there is a strong revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism, and a high sensitivity to the pulse of the times; the works are colorful, the strokes are bold, and there is a fiery combat lyricism.
    It is exciting that "Song of the Night Sea Battle" has achieved such outstanding results in such a short period of time. However, in terms of character shaping, some places are still not full enough. For example, the image of Instructor Tie is written very movingly in the first half, but it seems less powerful in the second half; the heroic image of sailor Ding Changbao can be portrayed more profoundly; some minor characters, such as Aunt Yu, have little effect; the language, especially the language of the old fisherman, needs to be further refined.

    The more urgent and heavier the task, the more important it is to highlight politics. The Party branch holds an emergency branch committee meeting on the march.
    The heroes of the 878艇 are full of fighting spirit and ready to jump on the enemy ship to completely eliminate the enemy.

    毛泽东思想胜利的凯歌
    ——评海政文工团话剧团演出的《夜海战歌》
    徐晓钟
    有毛泽东思想挂帅，有深刻的阶级仇恨，有高度的战备观念，不怕苦、不怕死，敢于消灭一切来犯的敌人，这是参加去年“八·六海战”、“崇武以东海战”的我英雄水兵的主要精神品质，这也就是我全体人民解放军海军指战员的主要精神品质。海政文工团话剧团新作七场话剧《夜海战歌》，就是以这两次海战为背景，描写了我英雄水兵的这种精神品质。一支舰艇部队，为了消灭敌舰34·7编队，保卫祖国海防，他们按毛主席的战略思想办事，选择待机点伏击。在这场海战中，他们坚决依靠人民群众，发挥敢于夜战近战，敢于刺刀见红的战斗作风，因而取得了海上歼灭战的新胜利。这个戏宣传了人民战争的威力，宣传了人的因素第一，它鼓舞了革命人民的士气，从精神上武装革命人民，这个戏演得是时候，这个戏的演出好得很！
    话剧《夜海战歌》着意塑造了我们英雄水兵的群象。作者把这群年青的水兵英雄放在“待机”，“返航”，“求战”，“出击”，“全歼”等比较单纯的事件中，来突出地表现他们的精神世界。
    在《夜海战歌》中出现的是我们时代的水兵，是毛泽东的战士。在毛泽东思想哺育下，他们胸怀宽广，政治觉悟高，他们团结、紧张、严肃、活泼。剧本把他们放在严重的考验面前，更表现了他们一不怕苦，二不怕死的精神，歌颂了他们一心为人民，一切为革命的革命情操。他们怀里揣着毛主席的语录本投入战斗，朗诵着毛主席的诗词去英勇杀敌，这就是我们的英雄的水兵形象。他们是生活中千万个王杰、麦贤得式的英雄人物的真实写照，是我们部队现实面貌的真实写照。
    878艇指导员铁振海，是一个海军舰艇政治工作人员的形象。在惊涛狂澜中，当战士们对美蒋匪帮的刻骨仇恨达到燃点时，他克制着内心的激动，坚持毛主席的人民战争的战略战术，不到时候不打。他善于用毛主席诗词作政治鼓动工作，在激励人们踏出狼牙礁险道、安排伏击地时，他激昂地朗诵了毛主席的三首十六字令，用来回顾英雄的父辈，表达红色后代勇于接班的决心和气概。
    另外，老阿公这位二十年前和日本帝国主义胜利地交过手的渔民，是毛泽东思想武装起来的人民的代表。他的出现，有如一个重要的音符，使这首歌颂英雄水兵的颂歌响彻着人民战争的高昂音调。
    在描写冲突和刻划人物中，剧本形象地揭示出了这个真理：“对我们军队来说，最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢、不怕死。”依靠人的因素，依靠政治，依靠人民战争，过去我们战胜过日本帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮；那么，今天同样地依靠它，就可以把一切敢于来犯的敌人打得落花流水，叫他们有来无回！剧本的主题思想体现了毛主席的军事思想。正当美帝国主义疯狂地扩大侵略越南的战争，并把战争矛头对准我国的时候，《夜海战歌》的演出有着极其现实的战斗意义；这个戏是最大战斗力的颂歌，人民战争的颂歌，是毛泽东思想的颂歌！
    海政文工团话剧团演出的《夜海战歌》，在艺术上有自己的特色。作者不追求离奇曲折的情节，努力塑造英雄水兵的群象。剧本虽然也写了在歼灭敌舰34·7编队的斗争中，战士之间由于思想水平和性格差异所造成的冲突，但它的主要矛盾还是敌我矛盾。写敌我矛盾，而主要的对手又不在台上，这确实是一个棘手的难题。作者安排了三个俘虏，有如三个豁口，观众从这里看到了34·7编队的逃窜、骚扰和覆灭。作者们企图按两次海战的真实情况那样，把每一个战士都写成英雄，而不在他们中间制造出什么严重的对立面来。因而，内部矛盾是在大敌当前、一致对敌的前提下，在全体指战员都有旺盛的斗志、高昂的求战情绪、勇敢不怕死的精神的基础上，有分寸地冲突起来的。因为有了共同的前提和基础，这种冲突只会把我们干部和战士的思想剖露得更深，更为高大，更为可爱。在这些课题面前，《夜海战歌》作了很有益的探索。
    这是一个写中国人民海军并有着中国民族气派的海军戏，它旗帜鲜明，调子高昂，气势磅礴。海政文工团话剧团正在逐渐形成自己的创作面貌的特色：在他们的演出中都有强烈的革命的英雄主义和革命的乐观主义精神，对时代脉搏的高度敏感；作品色彩绚丽，笔触粗犷，有着火辣辣的战斗抒情。
    《夜海战歌》在如此短的时间里取得这样突出的成绩，是令人兴奋的。但是，在人物塑造上，有的地方还嫌不够丰满，例如铁指导员的形象，在前半部写得很动人，在后半部却显得不够有力；水兵丁长宝的英雄形象还可以刻划得更加深刻些；有些次要人物如于母作用不大；语言，特别是老渔民的语言还有待进一步提炼。（附图片）
    任务越紧越重越要突出政治。党支部在征途中召开紧急支委会。
    878艇的英雄们，斗志昂扬，准备跳上敌舰彻底消灭敌人。
