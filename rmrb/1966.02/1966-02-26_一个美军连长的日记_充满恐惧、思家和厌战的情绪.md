　　A U.S. Army Company Commander's Diary
　　Filled with Fear, Homesickness, and War-Weariness
　　(Xinhua News Agency, New York, 24th) The American magazine *Life* published excerpts from the diary of Captain Ed Boit, a company commander of the U.S. Army's First Cavalry Division in Vietnam, in one of its issues at the end of last year. These diaries are filled with fear, homesickness, and war-weariness. If officers are like this, one can imagine how ordinary soldiers feel.
　　Below are excerpts from Boit's diary and conversations:
　　This morning, I sent three platoons to clear out the Viet Cong areas in our war zone. I'm uneasy and on pins and needles. I don't think any company commander can avoid being scared.
　　I wrote a letter home today. It's difficult to explain what's happening here to Lin (note: Boit's wife). At night, I feel terribly lonely. I hope Ticey and Andy (note: Boit's children) don't forget their dad completely.
　　It's Friday night now. What is Lin doing in Dexter (note: Boit's hometown in Missouri)?... My poor woman, she must be getting old. I really want to get drunk and sleep for twenty-four hours. If I wouldn't be punished, I'd sleep for thirty-six hours.
　　We're moving to a new area today, where the fighting is more intense and there are more opportunities to encounter the Viet Cong.
　　Last night was damp and dreary, and I must have broken the world record for the number of cigarettes I smoked... Slept in a hammock all night, but didn't close my eyes.
　　Went out on patrol this morning and had no encounters. We burned twelve thatched huts. Tomorrow we will search other huts.
　　I don't know if Lin and the children miss me as much. I really miss them painfully.
　　I am tired of all the killing, arson, and everything else related to the war here...
　　(The Viet Cong) opened fire on us today. The fighting was very intense all day. When the fighting started this morning, I wasn't particularly scared, too busy. But I have to admit, my knees were shaking a bit. How do I feel after this morning? I don't know. I feel a little scared, a little frustrated, and extremely tired.
　　We had five casualties this morning... What about tomorrow? How many of us will be gone from this world by this time tomorrow?... Why didn't I wise up earlier and become a civilian, only worrying about paying taxes and filling my stomach? I don't know. I have a feeling that my whole life ends here. May God give me strength to endure this tension!
　　I have developed a new life aspiration, which is to go home alive and reunite with my family... I am tired, everyone is tired. Now, I see the most terrible and horrific sights that humanity can see. It's terrible that death comes to such young people.
　　In the coming days, we will suffer even greater casualties, and I may be one of them... When you pick up a gun, every moment can be the last moment of your life... Now I know that my life is worthless.

　　一个美军连长的日记
    充满恐惧、思家和厌战的情绪
    据新华社二十四日讯　纽约消息：美国《生活》杂志在去年底的一期里发表了侵越美军第一骑兵师上尉连长埃德·博伊特的日记的片断。这些日记充满着恐惧、思家和厌战的情绪。军官尚且如此，一般士兵更可想而知。
    下面是博伊特的一部分日记和谈话片断：
    今天早晨派出三个排去清剿我们战区里的越共地区。我忐忑不安，如坐针毡。我想一个连长也没法不胆战心惊。
    今天我给家里写了一封信。要向琳（注：博伊特的妻子）解释这里发生的事情是困难的。夜里，我感到孤独得可怕。我希望蒂赛和安迪（注：博伊特的孩子）不要把他们的爸爸全忘了。
    现在是星期五晚上。琳正在德克斯特（注：博伊特的老家，在密苏里州）干什么呢？……我可怜的女人，她一定变老了。我真想喝个酩酊大醉，睡它个二十四小时。如果不受处分的话，睡它三十六小时。
    我们今天调到一个新的、斗争更尖锐的地区，和越共遭遇的机会更多了。
    昨夜又潮湿又凄凉，我抽烟的数量一定打破了世界纪录。……整夜睡在吊床上，但未合上一眼。
    今晨出去巡逻，没有遭遇。我们烧了十二所茅屋。明天将搜查其他茅屋。
    我不知道琳和孩子们是不是也那样想念我。我确实很痛苦地想念着她们。
    我对所有杀人、放火以及其他和这里的战争有关的一切都感到厌倦了。……
      （越共）今天向我们开火了。一整天周围（战斗）都十分激烈。早晨战斗开始时，我并不特别害怕，太忙了。但是也得承认，我的膝盖有点发抖。今天早晨以后，我有什么感觉？我不知道。我感到有点害怕、有点沮丧，并且疲劳极了。
    今天早晨我们伤亡了五人。……明天怎么办？明天这个时候我们会有多少人离开人世？……我为什么不早放聪明点，当个老百姓，只为交交税、填饱肚子而操心？我不知道。我有一种感觉，我的整个生命就到此为止了。愿上帝给我力量来承受这种紧张吧！
    我养成一个新的生活奢望，这就是活着回家，和家人团聚。……我厌倦了，每个人都厌倦了。现在，我看到了人类所能看到的最可怕、最恐怖的景象。死亡竟会降临到这样年轻人的身上，实在可怕。
    在未来几天中，我们将遭到更大的伤亡，我可能就是其中之一。……当你拿起枪时，每时每刻都可能是生命的最后时刻。……现在我才知道，我的生命一文不值。
