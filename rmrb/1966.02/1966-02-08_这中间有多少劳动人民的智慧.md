Title: How Much Wisdom of the Working People is in This

    Recently, attending the county's three-level cadre meeting was very enlightening. Especially after reading some articles about the revolutionization of the county party committee, I ideologically clarified an extremely important issue: a revolutionary, a Communist Party member, on the road forward, must be diligent in summing up experience, learning from summarizing experience, and improving from summarizing experience, to jump out of the circle of generalization and promote work to advance by leaps and bounds.
    Recalling past work, being "lazy" in summing up experience is precisely the "fatal wound" that has kept me stagnating for a long time.
    In recent years, under the leadership of the county party committee, our Meitan County has made considerable achievements in all aspects. Agricultural production has achieved bumper harvests for four consecutive years. If the total grain output in 1961 is taken as 100, then it was 127 in 1962, 137 in 1963, 165 in 1964, and 189 in 1965. This is an increase of 8.48 percent compared to the highest grain production level in history. Other cash crops have also seen significant growth. Water turbine pumps were a new thing in our county two years ago, but now we have over a hundred, ranking first in the province.
    These simple percentages include how much wisdom of the working people, how much experience of the leaders, and how much crystallization of the sweat and blood of cadres and the masses! In this, how many valuable experiences can be learned from, and how many detours can be avoided? However, we did not look at these, but simply summarized the figures and presented them to the county party committee as a whole. Why? Because we rarely went deep down, did not summarize living experience, and did not discover new problems. As a result, many advanced things could not emerge, and many model figures remained unknown. In this way, we lost many opportunities to promote the great advancement of work, making the entire work fall into generalization.
    Now, the Party calls on us to learn from Sichuan. Specifically, for our Meitan County, it means comparing ourselves with Wenjiang County. I believe that the Party's call for us to compete with this top county in the "Land of Abundance" is a great trust and encouragement to our Meitan County. It is understood that Wenjiang County, in about three years, leaped from a grain yield per mu of four or five hundred jin to nine hundred and thirty-nine jin; while our county, to this day, is less than four hundred jin, the gap is very large. However, the county party committee and all comrades, after carefully analyzing various conditions, are determined to exert their efforts, catch up quickly, and strive to catch up with and surpass this pioneer county in not too long a time.
    Ideals are translated into action. I personally believe that to achieve this glorious and arduous goal, there are many things that deserve our careful study, careful chewing, and careful digestion. But one extremely important point is to learn well from Wenjiang County's revolutionary spirit of constantly summing up the experiences of the masses, constantly establishing advanced models, constantly discovering problems, constantly finding gaps, and constantly moving forward. By summing up experience, establish "models" and bring out the "top talents." When one "top talent" emerges, another "top talent" surpasses, driving everyone to become "top talents." In this way, the spiritual outlook of the vast number of cadres and the masses will flourish, production and construction will advance by leaps and bounds, and distant ideals will become a true reality.
    In the future, we must foster revolutionary ambition and completely get rid of the circle of generalized affairs. Transform our thinking and improve our work style. Break the shackles of old habits, jump out of the five-foot square office, completely discard the word "lazy," and go to the masses. Stay at points to dissect sparrows, constantly sum up experience, so that work can have discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress. People's Committee of Meitan County, Guizhou

    这中间有多少劳动人民的智慧
    最近，参加县里的三级干部会，启发颇多，特别是读了县委革命化一些文章之后，使我从思想上明确了一个极端重要的问题：一个革命者，一个共产党员，在前进的道路上，要勤于总结经验，从总结经验中学习，从总结经验中提高，才能跳出一般化的圈子，促进工作大踏步前进。
    回忆过去一段工作，“懒”于总结经验，正好是自己长期踏步不前的“致命伤”。
    几年来，在县委领导下，我们湄潭县在各方面的成绩是不小的，农业生产连续四年丰收。如果以一九六一年的粮食总产为一百，则一九六二年为一二七；一九六三年为一三七；一九六四年为一六五；一九六五年为一八九，这比历史上产粮水平最高年份增长百分之八点四八。其它经济作物也有很大增长。水轮泵两年以前在我县还是个新东西，现在有百部以上，为全省之冠。
    以上这些简单的百分比，其中包括多少劳动人民的智慧，包括多少领导者的经验，又包括多少干部和群众的血汗结晶呢！这里面，有多少宝贵的经验可以借鉴，又有多少弯路可以免走呢？然而，我们没有去看这些，只是把数字汇总，全盘端给县委。为什么？因为很少深入下去，没有总结活的经验，发现新的问题。因而，使得许多先进的事物不能抬头，使许多模范人物默默无闻。就这样，丧失了许多促进工作大步前进的时机，使整个工作陷于一般化。
    现在，党号召我们向四川学习，具体到我们湄潭县，就是要同温江县比较。我认为，党号召我们和这个“天府之国”的头等县相竞雌雄，是对我们湄潭县莫大的信任和鼓舞。据了解，温江县在三年左右的时间内，将粮食亩产从四、五百斤一跃而为九百三十九斤；而我们县呢，至今不到四百斤，差距是很大的。但是县委和全体同志们，在周密地分析了各方面的条件之后，决心鼓足干劲，急起直追，争取在不太长的时间内，赶上和超过这个前驱之县。
    理想见诸行动。我个人认为，要达到这个光荣而艰巨的目标，有许许多多的东西值得我们认真学习，认真咀嚼，认真消化，但其中极为重要的一条，就是很好地学习温江县不断总结群众经验，不断树立先进，不断发现问题，不断找出差距，不断前进的革命精神。通过总结经验，把“样板”树立起来，把“尖子”拿出来。一个“尖子”出来了，另一个“尖子”超上去，带动大家都成为“尖子”。这样，广大干部群众的精神面貌就会蒸蒸日上，生产建设就会突飞猛进，远大的理想就会变成真正的现实。
    今后，我们一定要长革命的志气，彻底摆脱一般化的事务圈子。改造思想，改进工作作风。打破旧的习惯势力的束缚，跳出五尺见方的办公室，彻底丢掉“懒”字，到群众中去。蹲点解剖麻雀，不断总结经验，使工作有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。贵州湄潭县人民委员会
