    Investigate First, Then Decide
    A Meeting of the Neixiang County Party Committee on Studying Jiao Yulu in Connection with Reality
    On the morning of February 10th, the Neixiang County Party Committee of Henan Province held a meeting. At the meeting, a heated debate unfolded regarding the construction of the headworks project for the Xingfu (Happiness) Canal. The Xingfu Canal is a water conservancy project jointly constructed by the Chiwei and Zhaodian communes. The canal project headquarters proposed two plans for the headworks: one was to build a tunnel through the mountain to construct an underground canal; the other was to build an open canal, requiring 20,000 cubic meters of stone to pave the bottom and 800,000 bricks to encircle the top to ensure its durability. Some comrades on the county committee thought building an open canal was good, while others thought building an underground canal was good. The two opinions were deadlocked.
    In the afternoon, Liang Hongjiang, deputy secretary of the county party committee and county head, and the committee members came to the county committee meeting room again. However, he did not ask everyone to continue discussing the headworks project issue that was unresolved that morning. He said,
  “This afternoon, let’s study Jiao Yulu.” A comrade first read a communication introducing the glorious deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu. The county committee members used Comrade Jiao Yulu as a mirror to examine themselves. Then, Comrade Liang Hongjiang proposed: “The headworks project of the Xingfu Canal has been debated for so long without a resolution. I think we should, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, conduct an investigation and study at the construction site before making a decision.” Everyone agreed.
    At eight o'clock the next morning, Comrade Liang Hongjiang led several comrades from the investigation team to the Xingfu Canal headworks construction site, more than 50 li from the county seat, braving the rain and snow. After arriving at the construction site, the investigation team went deep into the field, conducted a thorough inspection, and grasped first-hand materials. They visited some farmers with experience in tunneling, solicited the opinions of water conservancy technicians, and listened to reports from some leaders at the water conservancy construction site. Commune members reflected that tunneling the canal headworks would be better. Tunneling is a long-term plan, solid and durable, and it doesn't require clearing sediment every year. Although it takes more effort now, it can be used for a long time and is safe. We are all willing to tunnel. Although the water conservancy technicians agreed with the masses' opinions, they believed that if the tunnel could not be dug through before the end of April, water could not be released for irrigation, and it would not benefit this year's drought resistance and flood prevention for a bumper harvest. The comrades of the investigation team felt that both opinions made sense. They conducted repeated research and finally proposed a win-win solution: in order to combat drought and seize this year's bumper harvest, first build a simple open canal, without a stone base or brick ring, saving labor and money, and release water for irrigation first. At the same time as building the simple open canal, tunnel through the mountain to build a permanent, solid, and durable underground canal. This plan was submitted to the county committee meeting for discussion, and everyone was very satisfied and unanimously approved it.
    Through this matter, the county party committee has gained a deeper understanding of Jiao Yulu’s famous saying, “Chewing someone else's chewed bun has no taste.” If the decision on the headworks project of the Xingfu Canal had been made sitting in the office, one of the two plans would inevitably have been chosen and the other discarded, committing a one-sided error. Because the construction plan was reasonably determined, it further mobilized the enthusiasm of the commune members for water conservancy. Their enthusiasm for repairing the canal was even greater, and the attendance rate was even higher.

### 先调查  后决定  内乡县委联系实际学习焦裕禄的一次会议

    先调查  后决定
    内乡县委联系实际学习焦裕禄的一次会议
    二月十日上午，中共河南内乡县委开了一次会。会上，为幸福渠渠首工程的兴建问题，展开了一场激烈的辩论。幸福渠是由赤眉、赵店两个公社联合兴建的水利工程。渠道工程指挥部对渠首工程提出了两个方案：一个是穿山开洞修暗渠；另一个是修明渠，为了保证明渠坚固耐用，需用二万方石头铺渠底，八十万块砖圈渠顶。县委有的同志认为修明渠好，有的同志认为修暗渠好。两种意见相持不下。
    下午，县委副书记、县长梁宏江，又和委员们一齐来到了县委会议室。不过，他并没有提请大家继续讨论上午悬而未决的渠首工程问题。他说，
  “今天下午咱们学习焦裕禄。”一位同志先读介绍焦裕禄同志光辉事迹的通讯。县委们用焦裕禄同志当镜子，对照检查了自己。接着，梁宏江同志提出： “幸福渠渠首工程争论了那么长时间也没解决，我看，应当象焦裕禄同志那样，到工地上来一番调查研究，再作决定才好。”大家表示同意。
    第二天早晨八点钟，梁宏江同志便带着调查组的几位同志，冒着雨雪到离县城五十多里的幸福渠渠首工地。调查组到工地以后，深入现场，作周密的考察，掌握第一手材料。他们访问一些凿山洞有经验的农民，还征求水利技术员的意见，又听了水利工地一些领导人的汇报。社员反映说：这渠首工程还是凿洞开渠好，凿洞是百年大计，坚固耐用，还不用每年清淤泥，尽管现在多出点力，可用的时间长，又保险，俺们都愿意凿洞。水利技术员们虽然同意群众的意见，但认为四月底以前挖不通山洞就不能放水浇地，不能当年受益，对今年抗旱防涝夺丰收不利。调查组的同志们感到这两种意见都有道理，他们进行了反复的研究，最后提出一个两全其美的方案：为了抗旱夺取今年的丰收，先修一条简易的明渠，不垒石渠底，不发砖圈，省工又省钱，先放水浇地。在修简易明渠的同时，穿山凿洞，修永久性的坚固耐用的暗渠。这个方案提请县委会议一讨论，大家都很满意，一致通过。
    通过这件事情，使县委对焦裕禄同志说的“吃别人嚼过的馍没味道”这句名言体会得更深了。幸福渠渠首工程，如果是坐在屋里作决定，两个方案必然是取一个舍一个，犯片面性的错误。由于施工方案定的合理，就进一步调动了社员办水利的积极性。他们修渠的干劲更大，出工率更高了。　《河南日报》记者　王光泰　武国华
