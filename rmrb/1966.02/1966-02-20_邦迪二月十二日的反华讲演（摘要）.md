    (Reported by this newspaper) According to USIS news: William Bundy, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, delivered a speech on February 12 entitled "The United States and Communist China." The abstract is as follows:

    There is no doubt that Communist China is the most serious and troublesome problem facing our foreign policy today. The foreign policy goals of Beijing and the means used to achieve them sharply raise for us the issue of war and peace in Asia, and the freedom and lives of millions of people not only in Asia but also around the world.

    The main questions we must first ask are: What are our goals in Asia and the world? What are the goals of Communist China? Based on this fundamental assessment, what is the best policy for the United States?

    From this perspective, the unfortunate fact is that the world we seek, and the world our Asian friends seek, are diametrically opposed to the Asia and the world that Communist China seeks. We seek a situation in which not only large countries but also small countries can develop into free and independent nations, free from foreign aggression or subversion. We hope they will achieve development and progress in economic, social, and political aspects.

    Today, the leaders of the Communist Chinese government are committed to promoting the development of communism through violent revolution.

    The current leaders in Beijing are also seeking to restore China to its former position of power. In the past, China exercised a certain degree of control over Asia, which varied with the strength of the ruling emperor. Under powerful emperors, this control was a kind of hegemony over the countries around its borders. Restoring this image and controlling power is certainly part of Communist China's foreign policy today.

    In addition to these historically rooted desires, the current leadership is motivated by a communist ideology that is still in a highly aggressive phase. Ideologically, this phase is similar to the Soviet Union in the 1920s and early 1930s, advocating change through revolutionary violence throughout the world, especially in neighboring regions.

    As you know, Lin Biao's article detailed a similar comparison based on the domestic experience of taking over China. The experience is to organize rural areas to oppose urban areas. The article expanded this comparison into the theory that the world's underdeveloped areas are all rural areas that should be mobilized to destroy the "cities." This means destroying all developed centers in the West – and of course, we are the first to bear the brunt.

    I mention this article because it clearly and comprehensively shows that this policy of violent revolution, which is central to our discussion of Communist China, has not eased but, at least at this stage, has intensified. Of course, we have repeatedly seen this policy in action.

    It is in Asia itself that the main force of Communist China's policy is felt, and it must be dealt with by its neighbors. We must take seriously the possibility that the expansion of Communist China's ambitions may not reach the point of eliminating local cultures as in Tibet, but at least to the point of exercising fairly comprehensive rule and control over the regions bordering it.

    I want to emphasize that, up to this point, I have been talking about the basic goals of Beijing's policy. To say that these goals are very expansionist is by no means to depict another Hitler. In supporting the image of an overwhelmingly powerful China whose will must be accepted, military power is important – they hope to believe that their nuclear capability may be beneficial at some point. But the doctrinal statements, or what Lin Biao and others talk about, is what they call "people's war."

    Our basic policy must include two interrelated efforts as important factors: one is to help the free countries in that region maintain security according to their wishes, and the other is to help them – also in accordance with their own wishes – improve their political, economic, and social conditions.

    These two fundamental elements of our policy have much in common with the policies that we and our NATO allies successfully implemented in those areas threatened by the Soviet Union after the war, and the situation we are still facing with Communist China is certainly similar to the situation we faced with the Soviet Union after the war to a large extent. We fundamentally dealt with the Soviet Union by helping Europe restore its strength and power, thereby successfully curbing Soviet ambitions. Since 1955, although the Soviet Union still harbors ambitions, we have seen a trend towards moderation.

    The foundation of our policy towards Communist China, like our policy towards the Soviet Union, must be a determination to deal with the external pressure of the Communists in China with a firm attitude. I would also like to quote Professor Fairbank:

    "We have no choice but to stand up against Beijing's insatiable demands."

    Our efforts and obligations for security must include significant military factors. The obvious fact is that without significant and direct military contributions from the United States, it would be impossible to have an effective military deterrent force around China's borders today, and therefore there could be no balance of power.

    This is the essence of what we are trying to do. Yes, it is containment, but containment that is implemented through comprehensive actions. And ultimately, containment depends on the actions of Asian countries themselves.

    We are Beijing's great enemy because our strength is a decisive factor in the overall balance of power and in the Asian countries' resistance to the Chinese Communist expansionist schemes in Asia. This is the truly dominant fact, not emotion, not the various mistakes that may have been made in the past, but this very simple fact, the fundamental contradiction between their aims and goals and ours, especially with our aim of supporting the Asian countries to maintain their freedom and independence and govern themselves according to their own will.

    We must, on the one hand, try to curb Beijing's ambitions and support the free countries in Asia and its neighboring regions; on the other hand, we can, while maintaining a firm resistance to their expansionist ambitions, open up the possibility of increased contact with Communist China over time, very cautiously weighing any steps we take in this region to prevent damage to the fundamental primary objectives in our policy, including our clear obligations.

    It is unlikely to expect the current unrealistic and dogmatic leaders to change, but at some point they will be replaced by a new generation of leaders. We hope that these people will see with brighter eyes and better insight that China's greatest interests lie in pursuing a peaceful path.

    邦迪二月十二日的反华讲演（摘要）
    本报讯　据美新处消息：美国远东事务助理国务卿威·邦迪在二月十二日发表了题为《美国和共产党中国》的讲演。摘要如下：
    毫无疑问，共产党中国是我国的外交政策今天所面临的最严重和最麻烦的问题。北平的外交政策目的及其为达到这种目的所使用的手段向我们尖锐地提出了亚洲的战争和和平问题以及不仅亚洲而且全世界的数以百万计的人民的自由和生命的问题。
    我们首先必须问的主要问题是：我们在亚洲及全世界的目的是什么？共产党中国的目的是什么？根据这种基本的估计，美国最好的政策是什么？
    从这个角度来看，不幸的事实是，我们所谋求的世界以及我们的亚洲朋友所谋求的世界同共产党中国所谋求的亚洲和世界是针锋相对的。我们所谋求的是这样一种局面：不仅大国而且小国也能发展成为自由和独立的国家，不受外国的侵略或颠覆。我们希望它们在经济、社会和政治方面取得发展和进步。
    今天共产党中国政府的领导致力于以暴力革命来推进共产主义的发展。
    目前北平的领导人也谋求使中国恢复过去那种声势赫赫的地位。以前的中国对亚洲实行了某种程度的控制，这种控制随着统治皇帝的力量的强弱而有所松紧。在强大的皇帝的统治下，这种控制就是对它边界周围的国家的一种霸权。恢复这种形象和进行控制的势力肯定是共产党中国今天的外交政策的一部分。
    除了这些有历史根源的愿望以外，目前的领导受到了一种仍然处于极为富于侵略性的阶段的共产主义意识形态的鼓舞。在意识形态上说，这种阶段同苏联二十年代和三十年代初的阶段相似，鼓吹在全世界，特别是在邻近地区通过革命的暴力实行变化。
    你们知道，林彪的文章根据接管中国的国内经验作了详情的说明情况相似的对比。经验就是组织农村地区来反对城市地区。文章把这种对比扩大成为这种理论：世界的不发达地区都是属于应将其动员起来摧毁“城市”的农村的。这就是说摧毁西方一切发达中心——当然我们是首当其冲的。
    我提到这篇文章是因为它清楚和全面地表明，作为我们讨论共产党中国问题的中心这种暴力革命政策并未缓和，而是至少在现阶段是加强了。当然，我们已一再地看到这种政策的行动。
    正是在亚洲本身，感觉到共产党中国政策的主要力量，而且必须由他们的邻国加以对付。我们必须重视这种可能性，就是共产党中国野心的扩大，未必达到象在西藏那样消灭当地文化的程度，但是至少达到对与它交邻的地区实行相当全面的统治和控制。
    我希望强调指出，谈到这里，我一直谈的是北京政策的基本目的。说这些目的是非常扩张主义的，决不是描绘另一个希特勒的形象。在支持人们必须接受其意志的一个压倒一切地强大的中国的形象方面，军事力量是重要的——他们希望认为他们的核能力在某个时候可能是有益的。但是教义声明或是林彪和其他的人谈的却是他们所谓的“人民战争”。
    我们的基本政策必须包括两种相互有关的努力作为重要的因素：一种是按照那个地区的自由国家的愿望去帮助它们维护安全，一种是帮助它们——也要符合它们自己的愿望——改善它们的政治、经济和社会条件。
    我们政策的这两个根本因素，同大战后我们和我们的北大西洋公约组织盟国在那些遭到苏联威胁的地区执行得很成功的政策有很多相同之处，而且，我们仍在面对的同共产党中国之间的局势同我们在战后面对的同苏联之间的局势在很大程度上肯定是相似的。我们曾经从根本上对付了苏联，办法是帮助欧洲恢复力量和实力，从而成功地制止了苏联的野心。一九五五年以来，虽然苏联仍旧抱有野心，但是我们看到了一种倾向温和的趋势。
    我们对共产党中国的政策的基础同我们对苏联的政策一样，必须是这样一种决心：以坚定的态度应付共产党中国人的外部压力。我还要引用费尔班克教授的一句话：
    “我们没有什么选择余地，只能挺身抵抗北平的贪得无厌的要求。”
    我们为安全而进行的努力和承担的义务必定包含重大的军事因素。显而易见的事实是，要是没有美国在军事上作出重大和直接的贡献，今天在中国国境的周围是不可能有一支有效的军事威慑力量的，因而也不可能有力量均势。
    这是我们正在努力做的事情的实质。是的，是遏制，但是是一种靠通盘的行动来贯彻的遏制。而且归根结蒂要取决于亚洲国家自己的行动的遏制。
    我们是北平的大敌，因为我们的力量是整个力量对比中以及亚洲国家抵御中国共产党在亚洲的扩张计谋中的一个决定性的因素。这就是真正起支配作用的事实，不是感情，不是过去可能做了的种种错事，而是这个非常简单的事实，是他们的目的与目标与我们的那种目的之间存在着十分根本性的矛盾，特别是同我们支持亚洲国家要保持自由与独立并按自己的意愿治理自己的权利的目的发生矛盾。
    我们必须一方面设法制止北平的野心，扶持亚洲及其毗邻地区的自由国家；另一方面，我们能够在对他们的扩张主义野心保持坚决的抵御的同时，随着时间的推移，开辟同共产党中国增加接触的可能性，非常谨慎地权衡我们在这一带地区采取的任何步骤，以防止损害我们政策中的根本性的首要目标，包括我们的明确的义务在内。
    指望现在的那些脱离实际和教条主义的领导人起变化，是不大可能的事，但是到一定时候他们总将为新的一代领导人所取代。我们希望，这些人会以较明亮的眼光和较好的洞察力看到，中国的最大利益在于奉行和平路线。
