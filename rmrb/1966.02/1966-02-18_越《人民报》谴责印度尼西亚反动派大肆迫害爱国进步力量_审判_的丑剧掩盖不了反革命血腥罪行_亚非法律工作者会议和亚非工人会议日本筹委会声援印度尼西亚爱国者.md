    Hanoi, February 17th, New China News Agency—The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published a commentary on February 17th, severely condemning the Indonesian reactionaries for "trying" Indonesian patriots.
    The commentary stated that after four and a half months of persecution and massacre against the Indonesian people and patriotic and progressive individuals, including members of the Indonesian Communist Party, this trial farce is a new trick played by the running dogs of US imperialism—the Indonesian reactionaries. Its purpose is to legitimize their extremely barbaric killing operations and to create excuses to continue them.
    The commentary said that although the Indonesian reactionaries, in coordination with the propaganda machine of US imperialism, have used extremely vicious rhetoric to distort the situation in Indonesia and slander Indonesian patriots, they cannot reverse right and wrong or conceal the facts.
    The commentary pointed out that it is clear that US imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries are the ones who plotted the coup and are implementing their coup objectives. The Indonesian reactionaries, who attempt to sell out their motherland to US imperialism at a low price, have been using and are using means more barbaric than those of the Middle Ages to persecute and massacre the Indonesian people, and are destroying the revolutionary achievements that the Indonesian people have fought for through many years of bloodshed and sacrifice.
    The commentary concluded by saying that the Indonesian reactionaries believe that "trying" those who acted to stop their coup plot can cover up their crimes. However, they are the ones who must be tried. They have been condemned by widespread public opinion. The Indonesian people will surely punish them!
    Conakry, February 16th, New China News Agency—The Permanent Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Asian-African Jurists Conference recently issued a statement in Conakry on the Indonesian situation, severely condemning the reactionary elements in the Indonesian military for their barbaric suppression of progressive forces and massacre of peaceful Indonesian people.
    The statement pointed out that the reactionary elements in the Indonesian military, with the support of imperialist reactionary forces, have carried out large-scale massacres and imposed death sentences on peaceful Indonesian people since September 30, 1965. The only crime of these people is having ideals of justice, freedom, dignity, genuine independence, and progress.
    The statement mentioned the fact that more than 87,000 innocent Indonesian people have been massacred, and a large number of patriots have been imprisoned.
    The statement pointed out that their families are destitute, facing hunger and poverty.
    The statement said that the Permanent Secretariat strongly condemns the reactionary elements in the Indonesian military for these barbaric crimes of undermining justice, law, and democracy committed against the progressive forces in Indonesia, and expresses its full support for the Indonesian people who are fighting against imperialism and for justice, progress, democracy, and national unity.
    The statement concluded by calling on all legal workers in Asia and Africa, as well as all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world, to demand an immediate end to the massacre and persecution of the Indonesian people, and to demand the release of all those who have been illegally arrested and imprisoned.
    Tokyo, February 17th, News—The Japanese Preparatory Committee of the Asian-African Workers Conference recently issued a statement saying, "We strongly protest the Indonesian reactionaries' cruel terrorist actions, suppression, and mass layoffs against workers, trade union leaders, and other patriotic democratic forces, and demand the immediate release of imprisoned workers and patriots."
    The statement pointed out, "The All-Indonesia Central Trade Union has not only been fighting to defend Indonesian workers and Indonesian national liberation, but has also been playing an important role in strengthening the unity and solidarity of Asian-African workers, opposing imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism, striving for independence and sovereignty, and promoting the unity of workers and trade unions in the world."
    The statement pointed out, "The current terrorist and persecution activities carried out by the reactionary forces are clearly instigated by US imperialism. These activities are a link in US imperialism's policy of expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Southeast Asian region, because this war of aggression has fallen into difficulties."
    The statement said that we Japanese workers firmly believe that the Indonesian working class and other patriotic democratic forces, under the leadership of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union, will surely overcome all difficulties, defeat the attacks of the reactionaries and imperialism, and achieve victory.

    越《人民报》谴责印度尼西亚反动派大肆迫害爱国进步力量
    “审判”的丑剧掩盖不了反革命血腥罪行
    亚非法律工作者会议和亚非工人会议日本筹委会声援印度尼西亚爱国者
    新华社河内十七日电　越南《人民报》十七日发表评论，严厉谴责印度尼西亚反动派对印度尼西亚爱国者进行“审判”。
    评论说，在经过四个半月对印度尼西亚人民和对包括印度尼西亚共产党人在内的爱国进步人士展开一场迫害、屠杀以后，这一审判丑剧是美帝国主义走狗——印度尼西亚反动派玩弄的一个新手段，其目的是使它们极其野蛮的杀人行动合法化，并使它们制造借口，以继续这一行动。
    评论说，尽管印度尼西亚反动派在美帝国主义的宣传机器的配合下，已经用了极其恶毒的论调来歪曲印度尼西亚的情况，污蔑印度尼西亚的爱国者，但是，它们也颠倒不了黑白，掩盖不了事实。
    评论指出，显然，美帝国主义和印度尼西亚反动派是策划政变和正在实现它们政变目标的人。妄图把自己的祖国贱价出卖给美帝国主义的印度尼西亚反动派，已经和正在使用比中世纪还要野蛮的手段来迫害、屠杀印度尼西亚人民，正在破坏印度尼西亚人民经过多少年代的流血牺牲才争取得来的革命成果。
    评论最后说，印度尼西亚反动派以为对曾经为了制止它们的政变阴谋而行动的人进行“审判”就能够掩盖它们的罪行，然而，它们才真正是必须被审判的人。它们已经受到广泛舆论的谴责。印度尼西亚人民必将惩办它们！
    新华社科纳克里十六日电　亚非法律工作者会议执行委员会常设书记处最近在科纳克里就印度尼西亚事件发表一项声明，严厉谴责印度尼西亚军队中的反动分子野蛮镇压进步力量和屠杀印度尼西亚和平人民。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚军队中的反动分子在帝国主义反动势力支持下，从一九六五年九月三十日以来，对印度尼西亚和平人民进行了大规模的屠杀和判处死刑，这些人民的唯一罪名是具有正义、自由、尊严、真正独立和进步的理想。
    声明谈到了印度尼西亚无辜人民已经有八万七千余人被屠杀，还有大批爱国者被关进监狱的事实。
    声明指出，他们的家属流落街头，面临着饥饿和贫困。
    声明说，常设书记处强烈谴责印度尼西亚军队中的反动分子对印度尼西亚进步力量犯下的这些破坏正义、法律和民主的野蛮罪行，并且表示全力支援正在为反对帝国主义，争取正义、进步、民主和国家统一而进行斗争的印度尼西亚人民。
    声明最后号召亚洲和非洲的全体法律工作者以及全世界所有爱好和平与主持正义的人民要求立即停止屠杀和迫害印度尼西亚人民，并要求释放所有被非法逮捕和监禁的人。
    新华社十七日讯　东京消息：亚非工人会议日本筹备委员会最近发表声明说，“我们强烈抗议印度尼西亚反动派对工人、工会领袖和其他爱国民主力量进行的残酷的恐怖行动、镇压和大规模的解雇，要求立即释放被监禁的工人和爱国者。”
    声明指出，“全印度尼西亚中央职工会不仅一直在为保卫印度尼西亚工人和印度尼西亚的民族解放而斗争，而且在加强亚非工人的统一和团结、反对帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义、争取独立和主权以及在推进世界工人和工会的团结方面一直起着重要的作用。”
    声明指出，“反动势力目前正在进行的恐怖和迫害活动显然是受到美帝国主义唆使的，这些活动是美帝国主义把它的侵越战争扩大到整个东南亚地区的侵略政策的一个环节，因为这一侵略战争已经陷入困境。”
    声明说，我们日本工人深信，在全印度尼西亚中央职工会领导下的印度尼西亚工人阶级和其他爱国民主力量，一定能够克服一切困难，打败反动派和帝国主义的进攻，取得胜利。
