　　Xinhua News Agency, Bamako – Malian President Modibo Keita, at the military parade celebrating the third anniversary of the Malian army on the morning of the 20th, called on the Malian army to remain vigilant against the subversive plots of imperialism and neo-colonialism.

　　President Keita, in addressing some recent events in Africa, said: “It is very clear that there are those who oppose the freedom of our countries to choose a path of development that conforms to the interests of our people. Not only that, but imperialists even oppose the right of the governments of our countries to cooperate with whomever they wish, and force certain countries to implement policies that violate the wishes of their people."

　　He said that imperialism does not allow African countries to pursue policies that safeguard national dignity and genuine independence, creates instability and chaos everywhere, and is determined to prop up their puppets to power, in order to maintain their exploitation forever. We are convinced that the people of Africa and the cadres of Africa will recognize this danger more and more each day.

　　President Keita said that the Malian soldiers should be prepared at all times to defend the motherland and the fruits of the people.

　　凯塔总统指责帝国主义在非洲制造混乱
　　号召马里军队警惕帝国主义颠覆阴谋
    新华社巴马科电　马里总统莫迪博·凯塔二十日上午在庆祝马里建军节三周年的阅兵式上，号召马里军队对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的颠覆阴谋保持警惕。
    凯塔总统在谈到最近在非洲发生的一些事件时说：“很清楚，有人反对我们这些国家有选择符合我们各国人民利益的发展道路的自由。不仅如此，帝国主义者甚至反对我们这些国家的政府有同自己所愿意的人合作的权利，并且迫使某些国家执行违反它们人民的愿望的政策。”
    他说，帝国主义不让非洲国家奉行维护国家尊严和真正独立的政策，到处制造不稳定和混乱，一意扶植他们的傀儡上台，以永远保持他们的剥削。我们确信，非洲的人民和非洲的干部会一天比一天认识到这种危险。
    凯塔总统说，马里的战士们应该时刻准备保卫祖国和人民的果实。
