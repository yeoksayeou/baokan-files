    When we read the articles by these county committee comrades on learning from Comrade Jiao Yulu and edited this column, our feelings were as excited as everyone else's.
    Many comrades are consciously comparing themselves and examining themselves in the face of the towering image of Jiao Yulu. We should do this. On the road of revolutionization, the life of Comrade Jiao Yulu has established a glorious goal for us. He is a good example of the revolutionization of our county committee leadership.
    In the process of discussing the revolutionization of the county committee, many county committee comrades analyzed their own mental and ideological states, and explored the answers to how to transform their subjective world and objective world. What is "selflessness"? How can we serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly"? How should we treat the masses, treat our class brothers, and treat the harsh natural conditions? All of these can be found in the fighting experience of Comrade Jiao Yulu, in this strong Communist Party member, with vivid and complete answers.
    Some comrades have reviewed and said that they still cannot completely get rid of personal distractions; some comrades said that they were somewhat frightened by the difficulties in front of them; some comrades' revolutionary will has declined a bit; some comrades have stagnated in the face of victory; ... Compared with the glorious image of Comrade Jiao Yulu, all this individualism and unrevolutionary things seem so low-level and insignificant!
    Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds have such a powerful force that it shakes people's class feelings and stirs up people's revolutionary feelings—"If the face of Lankao is not changed, we will not rest in peace"; "If I cannot cure the sand dunes while alive, I will watch you cure the sand dunes after I die." Who, upon hearing these exciting words, can fail to associate them with the situation in the area they lead and the work they are responsible for?
    In our study of Comrade Mao Zedong's works, in the process of realizing the revolutionization of leadership, learning from Comrade Mao Zedong's good student, Jiao Yulu, will lead our thoughts, understanding, and revolutionary consciousness to a new realm!

    引向新的境界
    我们阅读这几位县委同志学习焦裕禄同志的文章，编辑这个专栏的时候，我们的心情同大家一样的激动。
    许多同志都在焦裕禄这个高大的形象面前，自觉地对照自己，检查自己。我们应该这样作。在革命化的道路上，焦裕禄同志的一生，为我们树立了一个光辉的目标，他是我们县委领导革命化的好榜样。
    在县委革命化讨论过程中，许多县委同志分析自己的精神状态和思想状态，探讨如何改造自己的主观世界和客观世界的答案。什么叫做“忘我”？怎样才能“完全”“彻底”为人民服务？如何对待群众，对待阶级弟兄，对待严酷的自然条件？所有这些，在焦裕禄同志的战斗经历里，在这个坚强的共产党员身上，都能找到生动、完整的解答。
    有些同志曾经检讨说，自己还不能完全摆脱个人的杂念；有些同志说，自己有些为面前的困难吓住了；有些同志的革命意志有点衰退；有些同志在胜利面前停滞了；……跟焦裕禄同志的光辉形象比一比，所有这一切个人主义、不革命的东西，显得多么低级和渺小！
    焦裕禄同志的事迹有着这样一种强大的力量，它震动着人的阶级感情，鼓起人的革命感情——“兰考面貌不改变，我们死不瞑目”；“我活着不能治好沙丘，死后也要看着你们把沙丘治好”。谁听到这些激动人心的语言，能不联想起自己领导的地区和自己担负的工作的状况呢？
    在我们大学毛泽东同志著作的时候，在我们实现领导革命化的过程中，学习毛泽东同志的好学生——焦裕禄，将会把我们的思想、认识和革命化的自觉，引向一个新的境界！
