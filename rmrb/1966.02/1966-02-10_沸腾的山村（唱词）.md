	Boiling Mountain Village (Lyrics)
	Lan Jiantang, Commune Member of Xindian Commune, Nanyang, Henan

  Huangnigang at the foot of Funiu Mountain,
  A small village of a dozen households.
  For some reason,
  The mountain village is boiling and noisy,
  The old custodian runs to the center of the village,
  Carrying a seed drill on his shoulder,
  Walking forward triumphantly,
  Passing by the door of a house,
  Sticking his head in to take a look,
  And shouting at the top of his voice, Aunt Zhu:
  “Hey! Sister-in-law Lin, come out,
  Don’t you feel stuffy staying indoors?
  I have good news to report to you.”
  (Aside) "What good news?"
  Aunt Lin came out of the house and answered.
  The custodian said, “Your legs aren't so good,
  But you still want to go to the city for a stroll.
  Today is a lucky day,
  Comrades from the supply and marketing cooperative have come to the countryside.”
  Auntie said, “I knew about this earlier than you,
  Why are you making such a fuss?
  I was sitting in the house just now,
  When comrades from the supply and marketing cooperative delivered goods to my room.
  Selling things isn't all,
  Hey, they even bought my woven large baskets before leaving.”
  The custodian said, “You say this is nothing special,
  I mean the iron factory has moved to our village.
  It's so convenient to repair hoes and plows,
  So you don’t miss the good time for spring plowing.
  Hey, old sister-in-law, not only can the legs of the seed drill be repaired,
  Maybe they can even prescribe a prescription for your leg.”
  Aunt Lin curled her lips when she heard this,
  “Get out of here,
  You're forcing a conversation when you have nothing to say.”
  The custodian said, “I'm telling the truth,
  I don't mean to deceive you today.
  They say that a medical team has come from the province,
  And the best doctors have come to the countryside.”
  Auntie said, "This comes to the countryside, that comes to the countryside,
  How can there be so many good things coming to our village?"
  The custodian said, “If you don’t believe me, take a look,
  A city troupe has also come to the countryside,
  Called the Cultural Work Team,
  I heard that the lead actress Zhang Shufang has also come.”
  Auntie said, “Forget it, forget it,
  The more you say, the more unbelievable it becomes.
  Zhang Shufang is a famous star,
  How could she come to our small village?”
  The word "village" had just landed,
  When gongs and drums rang everywhere.
  A group of children ran ahead,
  Followed by a large group of actors.
  The commune members swarmed up with a shout,
  Instantly forming a wall.
  Some were busy grabbing luggage,
  Others were shaking hands and asking about their well-being.
  They were warmly invited home,
  And Aunt Lin was very busy when she saw them.
  Without saying a word,
  She reached out and grabbed a young woman:
  “Girl, come on, stay at my house,
  My room is spacious.”
  The girl hurriedly said, "Okay, okay,"
  The two walked into the house hand in hand.
  Aunt Lin reached out and picked up the new tea bottle,
  And picked up a new tea mug.
  “Come on, girl, have a drink first,
  I'll put some sugar in the bowl."
  The girl repeatedly said, "Don't be so polite,
  We’re family, no need to be so busy.”
  As she spoke, she picked up a broom and swept the floor,
  Auntie hurriedly pulled at her clothes: "You're already tired from running all the way,
  (Aside) Girl, take a break!"
   The girl said, "I'm not tired at all."
   After speaking, she went out to fetch water,
   Filling the water tank to the brim.
   Auntie didn't know what to say,
   With a smile on her face, she praised:
   “You climbed mountains and ridges to perform,
   And you still help me with my work at home.
   You are truly a good child of Chairman Mao,
   A good girl cultivated by the Party.
   Say hello to everyone for me,
   Especially that lead actress Zhang Shufang.”
   The girl smiled when she heard this:
   “Auntie, don’t praise me so much,
   I don't know about others,
   Zhang Shufang's acting isn't that good.
   If you have any opinions, please tell me,
   I guarantee she won't get angry.
   I'll go to the stage to take a look now,
   I'll come and support you when the show starts.”
   Auntie said, “Take care of your business,
   Don’t be busy for me alone anymore.
   We don't usually see operas in our mountain gully,
   Rest assured,
   I will never miss this good time.”
   The girl smiled without saying a word,
   And walked out of the room.
   She came to the large open space on the back slope,
   And saw everyone was hanging the awning.
   There were a lot of people watching the show,
   The girl hurried to put on makeup.
   It was almost noon,
   And the sound of gongs and drums filled the village.
   With the time for the play not far off,
   The girl hurriedly went offstage to greet Auntie.
   Not far ahead,
   She saw a group of people gathered in a hubbub.
   This one said: “Aunt Lin developed a cold leg disease in the old society,
   I didn't expect to be able to discard her crutches today."
   That one said: “Chairman Mao sent good doctors to the mountain gully,
   Their acupuncture skills are really strong.”
   The girl's heart blossomed when she heard this,
   She squeezed in and reached out to pull Aunt Lin,
  “Auntie, you——?”
  "I, my leg is already much better,
   Look how far I can stride in one step.
   From now on, I don’t need crutches to walk,
   And I can race with the young men and women.”
   The crowd laughed,
   The old woman told the girl the story:
  "Not long after you left,
   A doctor came to the door.
   The doctor knew about the disease on my leg,
   And I felt refreshed after an acupuncture needle in the room.”
   Auntie wanted to say more,
   But the sound of gongs and drums urged her to hurry.
   The girl said, “Auntie, wait and watch the play,
   I'm going to appear on stage soon,
   See if my acting is good,
   And you must help me backstage.”
   After speaking, she ran to the backstage,
   Aunt Lin sent the girl away.
   Looking up, all she saw were new scenes:
   Leaning against the mountain slope, a stage was set up,
   With green mountains as a backdrop and trees as walls.
   On this side, the charcoal stove was roaring,
   And the hammer was hitting with a clang.
   The master was sweating profusely,
   And stripped off his shirt.
   On that side, the commune members were buying goods,
   With all kinds of goods displayed for a long time.
   The salesperson was taking goods and calculating accounts,
   Doing business to the hearts of the people.
   The more Aunt Lin looked, the happier she became,
   And suddenly she heard the sound of strings in her ears.
   She hurriedly turned her head and looked at the stage,
   An old woman came out on stage.
   The old woman looked closely,
   Ah! The one playing the old woman was the girl just now.
   The more she watched, the more lively it became,
   And the play ended well.
   Thunderous applause rang under the stage,
   And the crowd cheered, shaking the mountains.
   This one said: “This play is called "Selling Baskets",
   Zhang Shufang plays the old woman.”
   That one said: "Her singing is really good,
   Listen to how bright her voice is."
   Aunt Lin was stunned when she heard this,
   Ah! This girl is Zhang Shufang.
   Look at her walking quickly to the stage,
   She's going to meet that good girl!

    沸腾的山村（唱词）
    河南南阳新店公社社员　蓝建堂
  伏牛山下黄泥岗，
  十几户一个小村庄。
  这一天不知为了什么事，
  山村沸腾闹嚷嚷，
  村中间跑来了老保管，
  肩上扛着耧一张，
  得意洋洋往前走，
  路过一家大门旁，
  伸头往里望一望，
  扯嗓子喊声柱他娘：
  “喂！林大嫂出来吧，
  呆屋里不嫌闷得慌。
  我给你报告个好消息。”
  （夹白）“啥好消息？”
  林大娘走出房门搭了腔。
  保管说：“你那两腿不利爽，
  还老想进城去逛逛。
  今天遇的真凑巧，
  供销社的同志下了乡。”
  大娘说：“这事我比你知道的早，
  你干啥大惊小怪瞎嚷嚷。
  刚才我在屋里坐，
  供销社同志把货送进房。
  卖了东西还不算，
  嘿，临走又买去我编的大箩筐。”
  保管说：“你说这事不稀奇，
  我是说铁工厂挪到咱们庄。
  修锄修犁多便当，
  不误春耕好时光。
  嗨，老嫂子，不光耧腿能修好，
  说不定你这腿也能给你开个方。”
  林大娘一听撇撇嘴，
  “去你的吧，
  没有话说你强开腔。”
  保管说：“我说的都是实在话，
  今儿可无意把你诓。
  人家说省里来了医疗队，
  最好的医生下了乡。”
  大娘说：“这下乡，那下乡，
  哪有这多好事到咱村庄。”
  保管说：“不信你就瞧瞧看，
  城里剧团也下了乡，
  叫什么文化工作队，
  听说还来了主演张淑芳。”
  大娘说：“算啦，算啦，
  越说越是不象样。
  张淑芳是闻名的大角儿，
  咋能到咱这小村庄。”
  一个庄字刚落地，
  锣鼓喧天响四方。
  一群小孩头里跑，
  后跟演员一大帮。
  众社员哄的一声围上去，
  顿时围成一堵墙。
  有的忙着抢行李，
  有的握手问短长。
  亲亲热热往家让，
  林大娘一见着了忙。
  不说短，不道长，
  伸手拉着个大姑娘：
  “姑娘，走，你就住到我家里，
  俺那屋里可宽敞。”
  姑娘忙说好好好，
  两人拉手进了房。
  林大娘伸手掂起新茶瓶，
  又端起一个新茶缸。
  “来，姑娘，你先喝一杯，
  我再给碗里放点糖。”
  姑娘连说：“别客气，
  自己人无须这样忙。”
  说着话掂起笤帚就扫地，
  大娘急忙拉衣裳： “跑一路累的就够呛，
  （夹白）姑娘你歇歇吧！”
   姑娘说：“我一点也不累的慌。”
   说罢又出门去担水，
   把水缸打的满荡荡。
   大娘不知说啥好，
   满脸带笑直夸奖：
   “您爬山越岭来演戏，
   到家还帮俺的忙。
   你真是毛主席的好孩子，
   党培养出来的好姑娘。
   见大家你代我问个好，
   特别是那个主演张淑芳。”
   姑娘一听抿嘴笑：
   “大娘不要多夸奖，
   你提别人我不知道，
   张淑芳演戏可不怎么强。
   有啥意见请你对我讲，
   我保证她不会气的慌。
   这会儿，我到台上去望望，
   等开戏我来把你搀上。”
   大娘说：“有事尽着你的办，
   不要再为我一人忙。
   俺山沟里常年不看戏，
   你放心吧，
   我决不会放过这好时光。”
   这姑娘笑笑没吭声，
   迈开两腿出了房。
   来到后坡大空场，
   见大伙正在挂遮堂。
   看戏的人儿真不少，
   姑娘赶忙去化妆。
   眼看到了大半晌，
   声声锣鼓响满庄。
   离开戏的时间没多远，
   姑娘急忙下台去接大娘。
   往前没有走多远，
   见一群人围着闹嚷嚷。
   这个说：“林大娘旧社会落下了寒腿病，
   想不到今天能丢下拐杖。”
   那个说：“毛主席给山沟里派来好医生，
   人家的针法真是强。”
   姑娘一听心花放，
   挤进去伸手拉着林大娘，
  “大娘，你——？”
  “我，我这腿已经好了一大半，
   你看我一步就能跨多长。
   从今后走路再不用拐杖，
   能和姑娘小伙赛一场。”
   说的众人哄堂笑，
   老人家把来由告诉这姑娘：
  “你走后没有多一会儿，
   有一个大夫到门旁。
   我腿上的病人家早知道，
   到屋里一针下去就清爽。”
   大娘还要往下说，
   锣鼓声催的人发慌。
   姑娘说：“大娘等着看戏吧，
   我这马上要出场，
   你看我演的象不象，
   下台可要多帮忙。”
   说罢就往后台跑，
   林大娘送走了这姑娘。
   抬头看，满眼尽是新景象：
   靠山坡，搭个戏台子，
   青山衬景树作墙。
   这边厢炭火炉子呼呼响，
   铁锤打的叮叮当。
   老师傅累了一头汗，
   唰啦扒个光脊梁。
   那边厢社员正把货物买，
   各样的商品摆多长。
   营业员又拿货来又算账，
   把生意做到人心上。
   林大娘越看越高兴，
   忽听弦声响耳旁。
   急忙扭头台上望，
   台上出来了个老大娘。
   老人家近前仔细望，
   呀！演老婆的就是刚才那姑娘。
   越往下看越热闹，
   戏到好处收了场。
   台下如雷掌声响，
   人群欢呼震山岗。
   这个说：“这一出就叫《卖箩筐》，
   张淑芳演的是老大娘。”
   那个说：“人家唱的就是好，
   你听嗓子多亮堂。”
   林大娘闻听猛一愣，
   啊！这姑娘就是张淑芳。
   你瞧她快步走到台子上，
   要去会那个好姑娘！
