    This newspaper's comprehensive report: According to Xinhua News Agency, after Johnson held a meeting with the South Vietnamese puppets in Honolulu to plot the expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, Vice President Humphrey, under Johnson's orders, went to Saigon, Bangkok, Vientiane, Karachi, and New Delhi in succession from the 10th onwards to carry out activities. He will also "visit" the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries to promote the US plan for aggression against Vietnam.
    From the 10th to the 13th, Humphrey held multiple talks in Saigon with the heads of the South Vietnamese puppet regime and inspected the US invading forces, the Australian and South Korean mercenary troops, and the South Vietnamese puppet troops. After this "intensive visit," he issued a statement upon leaving Saigon, demanding that "more countries join the United States in helping South Vietnam resist Communist aggression." He clamored that the United States must win this war in Vietnam.
    After arriving in Bangkok from South Vietnam on the 13th, Humphrey held talks with Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn on the same day. According to UPI, Humphrey "assured Thai leaders that the recent Honolulu meeting to discuss the Vietnam issue had no behind-the-scenes activities that could weaken the US position." "The United States will not retreat from its position on the Vietnam issue." Thanom said at a press conference on the 14th that Humphrey had handed him a letter from Johnson, stating that "the United States will not abandon South Vietnam, Thailand, and Southeast Asia to the Communists." Reuters stated more clearly that Humphrey's trip to Bangkok was to "demand a greater contribution from the Thai government to the Vietnam War."
    Humphrey and Thanom issued a joint communique in Bangkok on the 15th, emphasizing the "urgent need" to further strengthen Thailand's military forces and modernize them. Both sides also believed that there was an "urgent need" to strengthen Thailand's security forces to suppress Thailand's patriotic forces.
    On the 14th, Humphrey also flew to Vientiane, Laos, for a brief "visit," where he held talks with Souvanna Phouma. According to reports, Humphrey also reiterated to Souvanna Phouma the US's so-called "determination to oppose Communist aggression" and expressed "interest" in so-called "improvements" in Laos' agriculture, education, etc. On the way to Vientiane and back to Bangkok, Humphrey also inspected US air bases in Thailand and Thailand's strategic highways.
    On the 15th, Humphrey arrived in Karachi, Pakistan, from Bangkok for a one-day activity, holding talks with Pakistani President Ayub Khan.
    Humphrey announced at a press conference on the evening of the 15th that the United States had decided to grant Pakistan a $50 million loan, and the two governments had agreed to negotiate and sign an interim agreement for the United States to provide wheat to Pakistan as soon as possible. He also said that according to agreements previously signed by the two governments, about 100,000 tons of grain would now be shipped to Pakistan.
    Humphrey also said that he had discussed the Vietnam issue in his talks with President Ayub Khan.
    Humphrey left Karachi for India on the 16th.

    汉弗莱到处奔走推销侵越计划
    同西贡傀儡会谈叫嚷一定要“打赢”侵越战争
    又跑到曼谷万象策划扩大印度支那战争阴谋
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯，美国副总统汉弗莱在约翰逊同南越傀儡在檀香山举行会议、策划扩大侵越战争以后，奉约翰逊的命令，于十日起先后到西贡、曼谷、万象、卡拉奇和新德里进行活动。他还将到菲律宾、澳大利亚、新西兰等国家“访问”，推销美国的侵越计划。
    汉弗莱从十日到十三日在西贡同南越伪政权的头目进行了多次会谈，并视察了美国侵略军、澳大利亚和南朝鲜帮凶军以及南越伪军。他在这次“紧张的访问”后离开西贡时发表谈话，要求“更多的国家同美国一道，帮助南越抗击共产党侵略”。他叫嚷美国一定要在越南打赢这场战争。
    汉弗莱在十三日从南越到达曼谷后，当天同泰国国王普密蓬和总理他侬举行了会谈。据合众国际社透露，汉弗莱“向泰国领袖保证，最近召开的讨论越南问题的檀香山会议，没有任何可能削弱美国立场的幕后活动”。“美国不会从它在越南问题上的立场退却”。他侬十四日在记者招待会上说，汉弗莱转交了约翰逊给他的一封信，信中表明，“美国不会放弃南越、泰国和东南亚给共产党”。路透社更明白地说，汉弗莱的曼谷之行是为了“要求泰国政府对越南战争作出较大的贡献”。
    汉弗莱和他侬十五日在曼谷发表了一项联合公报，强调“迫切需要”进一步加强泰国的军事力量，并且使它现代化。双方还认为“有迫切需要”加强泰国的保安部队，来镇压泰国的爱国力量。
    汉弗莱在十四日还曾经乘飞机到老挝的万象作一次简短的“访问”，在那里同富马进行了会谈。据报道，汉弗莱也向富马重申了美国的所谓“反对共产党侵略的决心”，并且表示对所谓“改善”老挝的农业、教育等感“兴趣”。在飞往万象和返回曼谷的途中，汉弗莱还视察了美国在泰国的空军基地和泰国的战略公路。
    十五日，汉弗莱从曼谷到达巴基斯坦卡拉奇进行了一天的活动，同巴基斯坦总统阿尤布·汗举行了会谈。
    汉弗莱在十五日晚的记者招待会上宣布，美国已决定给予巴基斯坦五千万美元的贷款，两国政府并且同意早日谈判签订一项由美国向巴基斯坦提供小麦的临时协定。他还说，根据两国政府过去签订的协定，现在大约有十万吨粮食将运到巴基斯坦。
    汉弗莱还说，他在同阿尤布·汗总统的会谈中讨论了越南问题。
    汉弗莱已在十六日离开卡拉奇去印度。
