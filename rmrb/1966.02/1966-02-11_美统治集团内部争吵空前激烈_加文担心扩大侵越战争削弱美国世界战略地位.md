    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 9th dispatch: The American ruling clique further unfolded its infighting over the American war of aggression against Vietnam at an open hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 8th. Those who attended the hearing and some senators expressed strong unease about the Johnson administration's approach of expanding the war, and worried that "gradual escalation" would bring irreparable consequences to the United States.
    Retired US General James Gavin, who attended the hearing, advocated that the United States should not withdraw from Vietnam, but he also expressed dissatisfaction with the Johnson administration's continuous increase of troops to South Vietnam and expansion of the war. He said, "I think we should stay in Vietnam, because our nation's 'security' requires us to stay there, 'but I feel that we have reached a dangerous point, and we should strive to use what we already have there to do what we must do.'"
    Gavin accused the government of saying, "Let ourselves undertake too many obligations in various places—South Vietnam or Thailand," which would be "a mistake." He said he was worried that the Vietnam War would escalate to the point where the United States might not be able to undertake "obligations" in other parts of the world. Gavin believed that a large-scale increase of troops in South Vietnam would cause a weakening of the United States' "overall strategic position," which would be "very serious." He "felt increasingly uneasy" about the Johnson administration's current approach and requested the government to "re-estimate" the situation in Vietnam.
    After Gavin's speech, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Fulbright told reporters that the committee had not been so uneasy on any issue in the past two decades. He said that people were worried about whether the United States was making the right response in Vietnam.
    Fulbright also admitted at the Foreign Relations Committee on the 7th that the infighting that has erupted within the US ruling clique over the Vietnam issue is unprecedentedly fierce. He said: "I have never seen such a dispute, so many people holding reservations, such a lack of understanding or unease. I do not know what the purpose of this great undertaking that we have gradually taken on is."
    He accused Johnson of suppressing senators' criticisms "a bit too rudely." He said that when so much is involved, no government should expect senators to "silently agree," and some of the government officials' views on the Vietnam War are "something that any rational person might doubt."
    At the same time, many members of Congress attacked Johnson for acting arbitrarily and not informing Congress of the decisions made on the war of aggression against Vietnam. Republican House Leader Ford complained that Johnson's "secrecy is too much, and we should understand the situation in order to know whether it is reasonable to send more troops to Vietnam."

    美统治集团内部争吵空前激烈
    加文担心扩大侵越战争削弱美国世界战略地位
    据新华社九日讯　华盛顿消息：美国统治集团在八日举行的参议院外交委员会公开作证会上围绕美国侵越战争问题进一步展开争吵。出席作证的人和一些参议员都对约翰逊政府扩大战争的作法表示强烈的不安，并且担心“逐步升级”将给美国带来不可收拾的后果。
    出席作证的美国退休将军詹姆斯·加文在会上主张美国不应该从越南撤走，但是他又表示不满意约翰逊政府不断向南越增兵和扩大战争。他说，我认为，我们应该留在越南，因为我们国家的“安全”要求我们留在那里，“但是我觉得我们已经走到了危险点，我们应该努力来用我们已经在那里的东西做我们必须做的事。”
    加文指责政府说，“让我们自己在各地——南越或者泰国承担过多的义务”，这将是“一次错误”。他说，他担心越南战争会升级到美国可能无法在世界其他地方承担“义务”的地步。加文认为，如果大规模地增兵南越，就会引起美国“总战略地位”的削弱，而这将是“非常严重的”。他对约翰逊政府目前的做法“感到越来越不安”，要求政府对越南局势“进行重新估计”。
    在加文发言后，外交委员会主席富布赖特对新闻记者说，这个委员会在过去二十年内在任何一个问题上都没有这样不安过。他说，人们对美国在越南是否作出正确的反应表示担心。
    富布赖特七日在外交委员会上也承认，美国统治集团目前在越南问题上爆发的争吵是空前激烈的。他说：“我从来没有看到过这样的争执，那么多人持保留意见，那样的不了解情况或不安。我不知道我们一点点地担当起来的这一很大的工作的目的是什么。”
    他指责约翰逊压制参议员的批评“有点太不客气”。他说，当牵连到这么多的东西的时候，任何一个政府都不应期望参议员们“默默地同意”，政府官员对越南战争的一些看法是“有理智的人都可能要怀疑的”。
    同时，许多议员攻击约翰逊独断独行，不把侵越方面作出的决定告诉国会。共和党众议院领袖福特抱怨说，约翰逊的“保密太多了，我们应当了解情况才能知道派更多的部队去越南是否有理”。
