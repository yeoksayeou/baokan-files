    Superfluous Confession
    Japanese Prime Minister Sato has been working hard to defend the United States' resumption of bombing of North Vietnam, shouting that the United States should not be condemned. He also explained that he did not express regret over the resumption of bombing.
    Sato's American accent is not at all surprising. He has long shown that he is a running dog of American aggression against Vietnam. Therefore, his explanation is completely superfluous. The Japanese reactionaries, who are eager to profit from the US's expansion of the war of aggression against Vietnam, will only be happy about the Johnson administration's expanded war actions, and of course will not feel regret.

    多余的表白
    日本首相佐藤竭力为美国恢复轰炸越南北方辩解，叫喊不应当谴责美国。他还解释说，他不对恢复轰炸表示遗憾。
    佐藤的一副美国腔调是毫不足怪的，他早已表明是美国侵略越南的一名走卒。因此，他的解释完全是多余的，一心想从美国扩大侵越战争中捞一把的日本反动派，对于约翰逊政府的扩大战争行动，只会感到高兴，当然不会感到遗憾的。
