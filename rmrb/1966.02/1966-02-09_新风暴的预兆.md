    Recently, in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, American cultural aggression agencies were attacked by angry masses; in Porto Alegre, Brazil, the American consulate was bombed three times. These events show how strong the Latin American people's hatred for US imperialism is.
    Brazil and Ecuador are two countries under the strict control of US imperialism. The American ruling clique instigated reactionary military coups in Ecuador and Brazil respectively, installed its agents, established pro-American military dictatorships, and greatly strengthened American colonial rule. However, the more cruel the oppression of US imperialism and its running dogs, the more intense the resistance of the people.
    As Comrade Mao Zedong said, the various persecutions carried out by the reactionaries in various countries against the revolutionary people "can only promote more extensive and more violent revolutions of the people in the final analysis." The anti-American revolutionary struggles of the Brazilian and Ecuadorian people are developing day by day. The events in Porto Alegre and Quito are just some of the rising and falling waves of the anti-American tide of the people of these two countries.
    After the bankruptcy of Kennedy's "Alliance for Progress," the Johnson administration wanted to use the so-called "Johnson Doctrine" to contain the national democratic revolutionary movement in Latin America. However, the facts are completely contrary to its wishes, and the anti-American revolutionary struggles in Latin American countries are advancing wave after wave. The recent situation in many countries shows that the rule of US imperialism in Latin America has undergone an increasingly deepening crisis, foreshadowing that a new anti-American revolutionary storm is about to arrive on this continent.

    新风暴的预兆
    最近，在厄瓜多尔首都基多，美国的文化侵略机构受到群众愤怒的袭击；在巴西的阿雷格里港，美国的领事馆三次挨了炸弹。这些事情表明了拉丁美洲人民对美帝国主义的憎恨情绪是何等的强烈。
    巴西和厄瓜多尔，是在美帝国主义严密控制下的两个国家。美国统治集团分别在厄瓜多尔和巴西策动了反动军事政变，把它的代理人扶植上台，建立了亲美军事独裁政权，大大加强了美国的殖民统治。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗的压迫越残酷，人民的反抗就越猛烈。
    正如毛泽东同志所说的，各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命”。巴西和厄瓜多尔人民的反美革命斗争正在日益发展。阿雷格里和基多发生的事件，不过是这两国人民的反美浪潮的一些此伏彼起的浪头罢了。
    在肯尼迪的“争取进步联盟”破产以后，约翰逊政府想用所谓“约翰逊主义”的强硬政策来遏止拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动。可是，事实完全同它的愿望相反，拉丁美洲各国的反美革命斗争是一浪接一浪地向前推进。最近许多国家的情况都表明了，美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的统治已发生日益加深的危机，预示着在这个大陆上，一个新的反美革命风暴即将要到来。
