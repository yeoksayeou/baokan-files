    We don't compare to the factory buildings in height,
    We don't compare to the equipment in newness or age;
    We want to compare who has aspirations,
    We want to compare whose style is good.
    Difficulties are teachers,
    Difficulties are schools,
    Without paying a single cent of tuition,
    Revolutionary skills must be learned.
    We will not be lazy people,
    An old ox slowly pulling a broken cart;
    We want to be new trailblazers,
    Breaking through the confines and moving forward.
    One tree does not make a forest,
    One flower cannot make a spring;
    One factory being red is not enough,
    All factories being red is glorious.
    "Advance step by step, don't be impatient,"
    We listen to it and give a smile.
    Bring out the heroic spirit,
    We dare to surpass the world level.

    我们要做新闯将
    上海卫海铁工厂　唐文秀
  我们不比厂房高，
  我们不比设备新和老；
  要比哪个有志气，
  要比谁的风格好。
  困难是教师，
  困难是学校，
  不出学费一分钱，
  革命本领要学到。
  我们不做懒散人，
  老牛破车慢慢行；
  我们要做新闯将，
  冲破框框向前进。
  一棵树木不成林，
  一朵鲜花难成春；
  一厂红来不算红，
  厂厂红来才光荣。
  “循序前进莫急躁”，
  咱们听了付一笑。
  拿出英雄气概来，
  世界水平也敢超。
