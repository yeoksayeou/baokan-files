Title: Emphasize Politics, No Worrying About Plans; Business First, Always Worrying About Plans

    The great enemy of emphasizing politics is a purely business viewpoint. In the past, some leading cadres in our store always believed that it didn't matter much whether political work was done well or poorly, as long as the business plan was completed, everything would be fine. This influenced the staff, forming a view that: of all good things, completing the plan is the best. Therefore, in business operations, they often did things with high profits, did things with small profits, and didn't do things without profit. Their minds were filled with worries about not completing the plan, not being rated for awards, and not receiving bonuses, constantly circling around departmentalism and personal gains.
    After the Wuhan Municipal Finance and Trade Political Work Conference last April, our minds became clearer. We analyzed the situation in the store and believed that to emphasize politics in business work, we must first solve the question of serving whom: serving sales figures, or serving the people? We organized the staff to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's "Serve the People," focusing on understanding what Chairman Mao said: "This army of ours is wholly dedicated to the liberation of the people, and works entirely in the interests of the people." Then, we used "wholly" and "entirely" as yardsticks to examine and measure our work. Everyone realized that there is politics in every transaction, and we cannot act recklessly because of high profits, nor can we not act because of low profits.
    With politics in mind, we can more correctly handle various contradictions in daily work, and business becomes more and more lively. For example, in the past, some staff looked down on small transactions. Now, realizing that even a penny's worth of business is serving the people, they have come up with many ways to facilitate customers. Commodities that can be sold in small quantities are sold in small quantities as much as possible, changing jin into liang, changing liang into qian, and changing boxes into packages. These three- or two-cent transactions, although small business, add up to a significant increase in total sales when the cash register is cleared at night, becoming big business. Once, a customer wanted to take bananas to another place and asked if they could be stored for a week. The salesperson truthfully told him that they could only be stored for two or three days, so the customer didn't buy them. However, because the salesperson gained the customer's trust, the customer actively asked him to be a consultant and bought sweets to take back. In this way, the customer bought suitable goods, and we also did our business. Since emphasizing politics, there has been a situation of exceeding the plan every month. Last year, the annual plan was exceeded by 2.2 percent, an increase of 9.03 percent over the previous year. We have learned that making business lively depends on having the correct service ideology. Whether the plan can be completed well depends on whether politics is in command. Just as the staff of our store said: "Emphasize politics, no worrying about plans; business first, always worrying about plans."

    突出政治　不愁计划
    业务第一　老愁计划
    突出政治的大敌，是单纯业务观点。我们商店里的部分领导干部，过去头脑里一直认为政治工作做得好点差点没有关系，只要完成了业务计划，一切都好交代。影响到职工当中，便形成这样一种看法：千好万好，完成计划第一好。因此，在业务经营中常常是利大大干，利小小干，无利不干。脑子里整天担心完不成计划，评不上奖，得不到奖金，老在本位主义和个人得失上打圈子。
    去年四月份，武汉市财贸政治工作会议以后，我们的头脑才清醒起来。我们分析了店里的情况，认为要在业务工作中突出政治，首先必须解决为谁服务的问题：是为卖钱额服务，还是为人民服务？我们组织职工反复地学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》一文，着重领会毛主席讲的：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”然后以“完全”“彻底”为标尺，检查衡量我们的工作。大家认识到，每一笔生意里面都有政治，不能因为利大而乱为，不能因为利小而不为。
    脑子里有了政治，就能够比较正确地处理日常工作中的各种矛盾，生意也越做越活了。例如，过去有的职工对小生意看不上眼，现在，认识到一分钱的生意也是为人民服务，就想出来许多方便顾客的办法。能够拆零出售的商品，尽量拆零卖，变斤成两，变两成钱，变盒成包。这三分二分钱的买卖，虽然是小生意，可是到了晚上一清钱柜，销货总额大有增加，又成了大生意。有一次，一位顾客要往外地带香蕉，问能不能存放一个星期。营业员如实地告诉他只能放两三天，顾客就没有买。可是，由于这个营业员取得了顾客的信任，顾客主动请他当参谋，买了糖果带回去。这样，顾客既买到了合适的商品，我们的买卖也做成了。自从突出政治以后，出现了月月超额完成计划的局面。去年年度计划超额百分之二点二完成，比前年增长了百分之九点零三。我们体会到：生意做活，要靠有正确的服务思想。计划能不能很好地完成，要看是不是政治挂帅。正象我们商店职工们所说的：“突出政治，不愁计划；计划第一，老愁计划。”
