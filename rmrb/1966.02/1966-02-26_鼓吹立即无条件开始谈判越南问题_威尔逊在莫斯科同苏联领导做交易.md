　　Advocating for Immediate and Unconditional Negotiations on the Vietnam Issue
    Wilson Makes Deals with Soviet Leaders in Moscow
    Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. British Prime Minister Wilson, at the invitation of the Soviet government, visited Moscow from February 22nd to 24th and held talks with Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Kosygin and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU Brezhnev.
    The Soviet-British joint communiqué issued by TASS on the 24th stated that the talks held in Moscow between the two sides were "beneficial and constructive."
    Regarding the main issue of the talks between the two sides—the Vietnam issue—the communiqué simply stated that the two sides "frankly expounded their respective views on the situation in Vietnam." However, according to Western news agencies, Wilson, in a series of talks with Kosygin, repeatedly advocated that "the Vietnam conflict must be resolved on a political, not a military, basis," and that talks on the Vietnam issue "must begin immediately and unconditionally." An Associated Press report stated that "Wilson asked Kosygin and his colleagues to assist in holding a peace conference," and that "British officials found certain indications in Kosygin's words that Russia would be willing to assist in ending the crisis." A Reuters report stated that Wilson said at a luncheon hosted by Kosygin on the 22nd that he and Kosygin "agreed that military means cannot resolve the Vietnam issue."
    For the sake of the nuclear deal being conducted between the United States and the Soviet Union in Geneva, the communiqué stated that the two governments recognized "the urgency of taking measures to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons" and to "reach an agreement on this issue as soon as possible." The communiqué revealed that the two sides also discussed measures to "promote complete and thorough disarmament."
    The communiqué stated that the two sides also discussed "the issue of European security and the peaceful resolution of the German issue." The communiqué advocated that the two sides would work to "create an atmosphere of trust and relaxation of tensions, and encourage efforts to seek comprehensive cooperation between Eastern and Western European countries."
    It was reported that Wilson, during the talks, also requested Soviet support for the British government's "east of Suez" plan. In a televised speech delivered in Moscow on the 24th, Wilson clamored that "the center of danger is shifting from Europe to the vast region of Asia and Africa," and that the Soviet Union and Britain "must be allies in the pursuit of peace."
    Wilson, upon leaving Moscow on the 24th, issued a statement at the airport stating that the talks held with Soviet leaders were "satisfactory and beneficial." He believed that his trip to Moscow was "the beginning of a series of meetings between the Soviet Union and Britain." Wilson, upon returning to London on the same day, said at a press conference held at the airport that "our meeting was extremely beneficial." He said that in the future, when encountering troublesome matters, he and Kosygin could easily pick up the phone and talk to each other.
    When a reporter asked him whether he would convey the content of his talks with Soviet leaders to Washington, Wilson said, "We have always maintained contact."

　　鼓吹立即无条件开始谈判越南问题
    威尔逊在莫斯科同苏联领导做交易
    新华社二十五日讯　英国首相威尔逊应苏联政府的邀请，从二十二日到二十四日访问了莫斯科，同苏联部长会议主席柯西金和苏共中央第一书记勃列日涅夫进行了会谈。
    塔斯社二十四日发表的苏英联合公报说，双方在莫斯科举行的会谈“是有益的和建设性的”。
    对于双方这次会谈的主要问题——越南问题，公报只是简单地说，双方“坦率地阐述自己对越南局势的有关观点”。但据西方通讯社报道，威尔逊在同柯西金进行的一系列会谈中一再鼓吹“越南冲突必须在政治的、而不是在军事的基础上解决”，关于越南问题的会谈“必须立即无条件地开始”。美联社的消息说，“威尔逊要求柯西金及其同事协助举行一次和平会议”，“英国官员们发现柯西金的话里字里行间有某些迹象表明，俄国将愿意协助结束这场危机”。路透社的消息说，威尔逊二十二日在柯西金为他举行的午宴上说，他和柯西金“一致认为，军事手段不能解决越南问题”。
    为了美苏之间正在日内瓦进行的核交易，公报说，两国政府承认“采取措施来防止扩散核武器的迫切性”，并且“尽速就这一问题达成协议”。公报透露，双方还讨论了所谓“促进全面彻底裁军”的措施。
    公报说，双方还讨论了“欧洲安全问题和德国问题和平解决的问题。”公报鼓吹双方将努力“创造信任和缓和紧张局势的气氛，鼓励谋求建立欧洲东西方各国之间的全面合作的努力”。
    据报道，威尔逊在会谈中，还要求苏联支持英国政府的“苏伊士以东”计划。威尔逊二十四日在莫斯科发表的电视讲话中大肆叫嚷，“危险的重心正在从欧洲移向广阔的亚非地区”，苏英两国“必须是争取和平的盟友”。
    威尔逊二十四日在离开莫斯科时在机场上发表声明说，同苏联领导人举行的会谈是“令人满意的和有益的”。他认为，他这次莫斯科之行是“苏英两国间一系列会晤的开端”。威尔逊在当天回到伦敦后在机场上举行的记者招待会上又说，“我们的会晤是极其有益的”。他说，在今后遇到伤脑筋的事情的时候，他和柯西金可以随便拿起电话同对方通话。
    当记者问他是否要把他同苏联领导人会谈的情况转告华盛顿时，威尔逊说，“我们一向是保持接触的”。
