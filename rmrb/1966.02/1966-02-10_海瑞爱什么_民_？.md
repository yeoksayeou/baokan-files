    What Kind of "People" Did Hai Rui Love?
    Liu Mingrui, Wang Feng'an
    The landlord class throughout history has continuously praised Hai Rui for "loving the people like his own children." Comrade Wu Han in the socialist era even more praised him for "daring to stand up for the common people and speak for them," and "being the savior of the oppressed, humiliated, and wronged people of that time." In Comrade Wu Han's newly adapted historical drama "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Hai Rui is portrayed as firmly standing on the side of the impoverished peasants. What kind of "people" did Hai Rui actually love?
    Hai Rui said: "The boundary between officials and the people must be strictly observed and never crossed." (Proclamation on the Baojia System) This shows that "people" is only a concept that is contrasted with "officials." In his "Proclamation on Encouraging Disaster Relief Loans," he even more clearly stated: "Poor people and rich people are all people born under the same heaven and earth." Therefore, "people" includes people from two opposing classes. Some landlords and rich peasants become officials, while others cannot climb up the ladder. These landlords and rich peasants without official hats are also called "people" by Hai Rui. In fact, of these two types of "people," Hai Rui mainly loved the rich people, i.e., the landlords and rich peasants, and not the poor people.
    Hai Rui loved the rich people. For the fundamental interests of the rich people, and for the fundamental interests of the feudal dynasty that guaranteed the exploitative position of the rich people, Hai Rui saw that "exhausting the pond to catch fish means that even if you can catch fish now, there will be no fish next year" (Regulations on Reforms). Therefore, he advocated adopting the method of "long-term investment for great profit," giving the poor people the conditions to maintain a minimum standard of living so that they would not rebel and cause chaos. His lifelong efforts in returning land, measuring land, recruiting fugitive peasants, and providing disaster relief to the poor were nothing more than bait. Moreover, even he himself admitted that these baits were "the flesh of the common people." Hai Rui's "wisdom" lay in the fact that in order to save the collapsing Ming Dynasty, he implemented certain reform measures. The premise was to still maintain the feudal regime, not to overthrow it; the purpose was to prevent, weaken, or extinguish the revolutionary flames of the peasants; and the limit was what the landlord class allowed, not the satisfaction of the poor people's demands.
    Lenin once incisively revealed the essence of reform measures as "a measure to oppose the revolutionary class but also somewhat improve the condition of this class and thereby prevent the collapse of the ruling class" (Complete Works of Lenin, Volume 6, page 323). Take the land measurement and the Single Whip Law implemented by Hai Rui as examples. Comrade Wu Han believed that: "Returning land is, after all, one of the measures to 'protect the poor people'; the fundamental method is land measurement...and implementing the Single Whip Law." But we believe that whether it is returning land, measuring land, or implementing the Single Whip Law, not even a single hair of the feudal land ownership system is touched. What kind of "fundamental method" is this?
    How did Hai Rui treat the poor people, especially the revolutionary peasants? The answer can be found in his "Policy for Governing the Li" written when he passed the imperial examination, which was his first proclamation to suppress the Li people's uprising. After passing the examination, he successively wrote "Memorial on Suppressing the Li" and "Illustrated Explanation to the Ministry of War," further elaborating his counter-revolutionary strategic thinking. He opposed negotiating with the Li uprising army, who were skilled in dealing with feudal armies, saying that "it was one word 'peace' that ruined the Song," and advocated taking advantage of the strength of the large army to pacify the "chief culprits." After that, he would immediately open up crossroads in Qiongzhou to facilitate mutual support and suppress the "Li bandits." When he was the magistrate of Chun'an County, he threatened the revolutionary miners, "If you continue to do what you did before, you will only bring disaster upon yourselves" (Proclamation to the Miners). In order to strengthen military power and protect his official seal, on the one hand, he was very good at governing the army. There were two methods: one was to "house soldiers among the farmers," strengthen the "Baojia Law," and "detect the movements of each household," i.e., establish a special agent system; the other was to train soldiers among officials, i.e., focus on army training, including military training and instilling counter-revolutionary ideas. On the other hand, he was also very good at conducting counter-revolutionary propaganda among the peasants, educating them to "not fight, not become strong thieves, not commit murder, and not follow the White Lotus Sect and betray their lives" (Exhortation to Farmers). During his period of idle residence in Qiongshan after being dismissed from office, he still tirelessly preached: "As common people, you must not be cunning and disobedient to the law." In short, the revolutionary peasants were the Ming Dynasty's, and also Hai Rui's, "disease of the heart and abdomen." For them, Hai Rui would gladly cut them with his own hands and still not be satisfied with his hatred.
    Needless to say, in feudal society, those who were "oppressed, humiliated, and wronged" were none other than these revolutionary peasants. They were forced to take to the mountains, while the Ming law clearly stipulated that "rebellion" was one of the "ten evils" and could not be forgiven. Hai Rui, who meticulously enforced the "three-foot king's law," of course, showed them no mercy. Hai Rui was by no means their "savior," but their "public enemy." Comrade Wu Han beautified the "public enemy" of the poor peasants into a "savior." Isn't this clearly combining the peasants and their enemies "into one" and opposing the peasants' class struggle?

    海瑞爱什么“民”？
    柳明瑞　王凤安
    历代的地主阶级不断地赞扬海瑞“爱民如子”，社会主义时代的吴晗同志更赞扬他“敢替老百姓撑腰说话”，“是当时被压抑、被侮辱、被冤屈的人们的救星”。吴晗同志在新编历史剧《海瑞罢官》中，把海瑞装扮成坚定地站在贫苦农民的一边。到底海瑞爱的是什么“民”呢？
    海瑞说：“官民界限凛不可越。”（《保甲告示》）可知“民”只是与“官”相对称的一个概念。他在《劝赈贷告示》中更明确地说：“贫民富民，均一天地所生之民也。”因此，“民”包括两个相敌对的阶级中的人。地主富农有的做官，有的也爬不上去，这些没有乌纱帽的地主富农，海瑞也称之为“民”。其实对这两种“民”，海瑞爱的主要是富民、即地主富农，而不是穷民。
    海瑞爱富民。为了富民的根本利益，为了保证富民的剥削地位的封建王朝的根本利益，海瑞看出“竭泽而渔，非不得鱼，明年无鱼”（《兴革条例》），所以就主张采取“放长线钓大鱼”的办法，给穷民们以维持最低生活水准的条件，使他们不谋反作乱。他一生的退田、丈田、召募逃民、赈济穷民等等，无非是些钓饵。而且这些钓饵，连他自己也承认是“小民之肉”。海瑞的“明智”之处，就在于他为了挽救朱明王朝于既倒，实施了某些改良措施。其前提是依旧保持封建政权，而不是推翻它；其目的是为了防止、削弱或扑灭农民的革命烈火；其限度是地主阶级所允许的，而不是穷民要求的满足。
    列宁曾经透辟地揭露过改良措施的实质，是“当做一种反对革命阶级但也多少改善这个阶级处境并以此防止统治阶级垮台的措施”（《列宁全集》第六卷第三二三页）。就以海瑞进行的丈田、一条鞭法来说，吴晗同志认为：“退田毕竟是‘卵翼穷民’的措施之一，根本的办法是清丈……贯彻一条鞭法。”但是我们认为，退田也罢，清丈也罢，贯彻一条鞭法也罢，对封建土地所有制连一根毫毛也没有触动，这是一种什么样的“根本的办法”呀？
    海瑞对穷民，特别是对革命农民的态度怎样，可以从他中举时作的那篇《治黎策》中去找解答，这是他讨伐黎族人民起义的第一篇檄文。他中举之后又接连写了《平黎疏》、《上兵部图说》，进一步发挥了他的反革命的策略思想。他反对跟善于与封建军队周旋斗争的黎族起义军讲和，说什么“误宋者在一和字”，主张乘大军之势，平定“首恶”之后，马上在琼州开通十字路，以便互相呼应，进剿“黎寇”。在任淳安知县时，他威胁革命的矿工们，“若仍前所为，是终日取祸之也”（《谕矿徒告示》）。为了加强军事力量，保住印把子，他一方面很善于治兵，办法有二，一是“寓兵于农”，强化“保甲法”，“觉察各户动静”，即建立特务系统，一是练兵于官，即抓军队的训练，包括军事训练和灌输反革命思想；另一方面又很会向农民进行反革命宣传，教育农民“毋斗争，毋作强贼，毋殴杀人，毋从白莲教自事负其生”（《劝农文》）。在罢官后琼山闲居时期，他还喋喋不休地进行说教：“做百姓不可做刁顽不听法度的百姓。”总之，革命的农民是明王朝、也是海瑞的“心腹之疾”。对于他们，海瑞是亲手刃之而不解其恨的。
    不消说，在封建社会里“被压抑、被侮辱、被冤屈的人们”，莫过于这些革命农民了。他们被逼上了梁山，而明律明文规定：“谋反”是“十恶”之一，不可饶恕。一丝不苟地执行“三尺王法”的海瑞，当然对他们是毫不宽恕的。海瑞根本不是他们的“救星”，而是他们的“公敌”。吴晗同志把穷苦农民的“公敌”美化成“救星”，这不明明是在将农民和他们的敌人“合二而一”，反对农民的阶级斗争吗？
