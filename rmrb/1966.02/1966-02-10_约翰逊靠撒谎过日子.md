    Johnson Lives by Lying
    The American newspaper *The Washington Post* published an article on January 30, complaining that the Johnson administration was engaging in deception and lies to cover up its failures in the Vietnam War. Of course, the Johnson administration doesn't just lie about the things mentioned in the article. Imperialists and reactionaries have always lived by deceiving people. However, even the American bourgeois press thinks these lies told by Johnson are too clumsy. The following is an excerpt of the article, with annotations and comments:
    People have repeatedly discovered that the United States tells half-truths and clumsy lies. Their trust in our government has been greatly shaken. For example, Secretary of Defense McNamara's optimistic reports on the Vietnam War often contradict what is happening on the battlefield. (This is called lying through one's teeth.)
    It seems that the official policy on the Vietnam issue is to cover up. (Due to its shameful nature.) A telegram issued by the State Department in 1962 remains classified. This telegram instructs American commanders in Vietnam not to take reporters on missions that might cause adverse publicity. (American reporters have indeed exposed many embarrassing things about the American aggressors. It's better not to bring them along.) The telegram also ordered that the fact that Americans were directing combat against the Viet Cong should not be publicized.
    This telegram was later replaced by other telegrams, which piously stated that the public had the right to know information that did not involve security issues. Nevertheless, the original guidelines were still followed.
    Not long ago, official news officer Lieutenant Colonel George Brown imaginatively described an ambush northwest of Saigon. He said that guerrillas attacked the rear of a First Infantry Division truck convoy. He vividly described how the troops got out of the vehicles and repelled the attack. Survivors later complained that the newspaper “messed things up.” They said that the trucks had been sent to transport infantry, who were attacked while crowding onto the vehicles. An officer said: "This message completely gives the wrong impression, although it does seem to make our situation look better than it should." (Covering up defeats naturally leads to contradictions.)
    According to another news officer, helicopters were damaged near Da Nang by mortar shells fired from outside the base. After the news was reported in the newspapers with large headlines, reporters discovered that the helicopters were destroyed by explosive charges buried in front of the Marine Corps guards. (After all, they admitted they were "written off." Compared to some other "war reports," this lie isn't too big.)
    There is also obfuscation in reporting casualty figures to make American losses appear smaller than they actually are. It is possible that everyone in a company was killed, while other units were not involved, yet the casualties are still described as "minor," the rationale being that a company is only a small part of the total personnel in a theater of war. (According to this logic, even if all 200,000 American troops in Vietnam were killed, it could still be said to be "minor" casualties, because this is only a small part of the entire American armed forces.)
    Previous presidents have tried to present the situation to the public as favorably as possible, but no president has suppressed the dissemination of information like President Johnson. (American imperialism's situation is declining rapidly. News is becoming more and more unfavorable to them. How can Johnson not suppress its dissemination?) His anger at unauthorized disclosure of information has frightened the few who have always been casual in their speech. Under President Johnson's leadership, many government departments have issued announcements portraying the situation as the government would like it to be.
    Most people seem to think that the government should not lie or deceive. (How can con men survive without lying and deceiving?)

### 约翰逊靠撒谎过日子

    约翰逊靠撒谎过日子
    美国《华盛顿邮报》一月三十日发表文章，怨责约翰逊政府在掩饰侵越败绩方面弄虚作假、撒谎骗人。当然，约翰逊政府并不仅在文中所提到的这些事情上撒谎。帝国主义和反动派从来就是靠骗人过日子的。不过，约翰逊所撒的这些谎言，连美国资产阶级报刊也认为是太笨拙了。现将该文摘译，并加批注发表如下：
    人们一再发现美国说一些半真半假的话，扯一些笨拙的谎话。他们对我国政府的信任已经大大动摇。例如，国防部长麦克纳马拉关于越南战争的乐观报道，经常同战场上发生的情况发生抵触。（这叫瞪着眼睛撒谎。）
    看来，官方对越南问题的政策就是要遮遮掩掩。（见不得人之故也。）国务院在一九六二年发出的一个电报现在仍然保密，这个电报指示美国在越南的指挥官在执行可能引起不良宣传后果的任务时不要带记者。（美国记者的确出了美国侵略者不少洋相，以不带为妙。）电报还命令不要发表美国人在指挥对越共的战斗。
    这个电报后来被其他一些电报代替了，这些电报冠冕堂皇地说什么公众有权知道不涉及安全问题的消息。虽然如此，原来的指导方针还是遵守着。
    不久以前，官方的新闻官乔治·布朗中校凭想象介绍西贡西北的一次伏击战。他说，游击队袭击了第一步兵师卡车队的后半。他有声有色地谈到军队如何下车击退这次袭击。幸存者后来抱怨报纸“把情况搞得乱七八糟”。他们说，派出卡车是去运载步兵的，他们在挤着上车的时候遭到了袭击。一个军官说：“这个消息完全使人得到错误印象，虽然它看起来确实使我们的情况比应有的要好一些。”（掩盖败绩自然要矛盾百出。）
    据另一个新闻官说，直升飞机是在岘港附近被来自基地外面的迫击炮弹打坏的。在各报以大字标题报道这个消息后，记者们发现，这些直升飞机是被埋在海军陆战队卫兵眼前的爆破炸药炸毁的。（毕竟承认是“报销”了，比起其它一些“战报”来这个谎撒得还不算太大。）
    在报道伤亡数字时故弄玄虚，使美国的损失看起来比实际情况少一些。可能有一个连的所有的人都被打死了，而别的部队没有牵扯在内，死伤却仍然被说成是“轻微的”，其理论根据是：一个连只不过是一个战区的全部人员的一小部分。（按此逻辑，侵越美军二十万通通死光，也可以说是“轻微的”伤亡。因为这不过是美国全部武装部队的一小部分。）
    历届总统都力图向公众把情况说得尽可能好，但是还没有一个总统象约翰逊总统那样压制消息的传播。（美帝国主义处境江河日下，消息对他们越来越不利，约翰逊不压制其传播怎么行呢？）他对未经许可就透露消息表示愤怒，这就吓坏了向来随便讲话的少数人。在约翰逊总统的领导下，许多政府部门发表公告，把情况说得象政府所希望的那样。
    大多数人看来都认为，政府不应当撒谎或骗人。（骗子手不靠撒谎和骗人怎么能活得下去呢？）
