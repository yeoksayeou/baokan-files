The notice requires Party committees at various localities and counties to specifically organize this study, mobilize leading cadres at all levels to conduct several discussions, use Comrade Jiao Yulu's glorious example as a mirror to compare themselves, identify their shortcomings in ideological revolutionization, and, in light of their existing problems, formulate plans for creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to strengthen ideological transformation.
    The Standing Committee of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee collectively studied Comrade Jiao Yulu's deeds on the 9th, and discussed and approved the "Notice on Organizing All Party Members and Cadres to Earnestly Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu," calling on all Party members and cadres in the province, especially leading comrades at all levels, to earnestly learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu in the upsurge of studying Chairman Mao's works, and, through this study, to create a strong atmosphere of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to raise political consciousness to a high level, and, in the spirit of having great drive and steady steps, to do a better job in all aspects of work.
