　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 18th. The Albanian newspaper *People's Voice* published a commentary on the 18th, pointing out that the Geneva Disarmament Conference has become a new exchange for US imperialism and Soviet revisionism to plot conspiracies. At the conference, they vigorously promoted the "significance" of concluding a non-proliferation nuclear weapons agreement. The commentary stated that agreeing to such an agreement would be tantamount to asking the people of all countries to lay down their arms before an enemy armed to the teeth with atomic weapons—US imperialism—and to submit to the US-Soviet collaboration's arrogant plan to dominate the world. The conspiracy to conclude such an agreement also lies in making unwarranted accusations against so-called "opponents of international cooperation," and using this agreement to attack all those who oppose US-Soviet collaboration to dominate the world, and to attack all those who are struggling for genuine disarmament and to defend freedom and national sovereignty.

　　The commentary also condemned the anti-China clamor of the Indian reactionaries at the Disarmament Conference. The commentary said that the Indian representatives, in coordination with Soviet revisionism and US imperialism, carried out provocative slanders against China at the Disarmament Conference, turning the Disarmament Conference into an anti-China forum. The Indian representatives reversed black and white and shamelessly said that China is an obstacle to solving the disarmament problem, and that China does not consider the interests of international security, etc. The commentary said that this malicious slander against China is an inseparable part of the joint anti-China action of US imperialism and Soviet revisionists. They jointly oppose China because China resolutely opposes US-Soviet collaboration to dominate the world, and because China has become an indestructible obstacle to the US and the Soviet Union realizing their plans to antagonize the freedom, socialism, and genuine international security of the people of all countries.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, February 19th. The Albanian newspaper *People's Voice* published an article on the 19th, exposing the collusion between Soviet revisionists and Japanese reactionaries.

　　The article stated that for a long time, Japan has played an active role in US imperialism's global strategy against Asian socialist countries and the liberation movements of the people of Asian countries. With the consistent support of US imperialism, Japan is rapidly embarking on the path of militarism.

　　The article pointed out that just as the role of Japanese militarism in US imperialism's Asia-focused global strategy is becoming increasingly obvious, the rapprochement and cooperation between the Japanese Sato government and the Soviet revisionist leadership are strengthening. Japanese Foreign Minister Shiina's visit to the Soviet Union in January illustrated this. The purpose of the "sincere and beneficial" talks between the Soviet Union and Japan in Moscow was to concretize cooperation between the two countries and plot secret conspiracies against the freedom and independence of the people of Asian countries.

　　The article pointed out that the rapprochement between Japanese militarists and the Soviet revisionist leadership has been supported and encouraged by US imperialism. Khrushchev revisionists and US imperialism regard Japanese militarism as a tool for their joint opposition to China and the liberation movements of the people of Asian countries.

　　The article said that in order to cover up the despicable purpose of their rapprochement with Japanese militarists, Soviet leaders have greatly praised the Sato government, saying that this government has made "constructive efforts" for peace and international security, etc. Therefore, Radio Moscow is now talking about the "joint action" between the Soviet Union and Japan to maintain the interests of peace. The Soviet magazine *New Times* advocates that the improvement of Soviet-Japanese relations is in line with the interests of "consolidating peace in the Far East and the world." However, no amount of deceptive propaganda by Khrushchev revisionists can conceal the reactionary nature of the Japanese government. The Sato government, which is reviving Japanese militarism, is pursuing a policy of relying on US imperialism and serving Japanese monopoly capital.

　　阿报谴责美苏合作主宰世界的狂妄计划
　　裁军会议成了美苏勾结的交易所
　　苏联领导勾结日本军国主义者反华得到美帝支持
    新华社地拉那十八日电  阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十八日发表评论指出，日内瓦裁军会议已经成为美帝国主义和苏联修正主义之间策划阴谋的新交易所。他们在会议上大肆宣扬缔结不扩散核武器协议的“意义”。评论说，赞同这样一个协议，就等于要各国人民在一个用原子武器武装到牙齿的敌人——美帝国主义面前放下武器，并屈从于美苏合作主宰世界的狂妄计划。缔结这样一个协议的阴谋还在于对所谓“国际合作的反对者”进行莫须有的指责，并且利用这个协议来打击所有反对美苏合作主宰世界的人们、打击一切为争取真正的裁军、保卫自由和国家主权而进行斗争的人们。
    评论还谴责印度反动派在裁军会议上的反华叫嚣。评论说，印度代表在裁军会议上配合苏联修正主义和美帝国主义，对中国进行挑衅性的诬蔑，把裁军会议变成了反华讲坛。印度代表颠倒黑白，无耻地说中国是解决裁军问题的障碍，中国不考虑国际安全利益等等。评论说，这种对中国的恶意诽谤是美帝国主义和苏联修正主义者联合反华行动中不可分割的一部分。他们联合反华是因为中国坚决反对美苏合作主宰世界，是因为中国成了苏美实现敌视各国人民的自由、社会主义和国际真正安全的计划的不可摧毁的障碍。
    新华社地拉那十九日电阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十九日发表文章，揭露苏联修正主义者同日本反动派的勾结。
    文章说，长期以来，日本在美帝国主义反对亚洲社会主义国家和亚洲各国人民解放运动的全球战略中扮演着积极的角色。在美帝国主义的一贯支持下，日本正迅速地走上军国主义的道路。
    文章指出，正当日本军国主义在美帝国主义以亚洲为重点的全球战略中的作用日益明显时，日本佐藤政府和苏联修正主义领导的接近和合作正在加强。日本外务大臣椎名一月份对苏联的访问说明了这一点。苏日在莫斯科举行的“诚挚和有益”的会谈的目的就在于使两国的合作具体化和策划反对亚洲各国人民自由和独立的秘密阴谋。
    文章指出，日本军国主义者同苏联修正主义领导的靠拢得到美帝国主义的支持和怂恿。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和美帝国主义把日本军国主义当作他们联合反对中国和亚洲各国人民解放运动的工具。
    文章说，苏联领导人为了掩盖他们同日本军国主义者靠拢的卑鄙目的，大事吹捧佐藤政府，说什么这个政府对和平和国际安全作出了“富有建设性的努力”等等。因此，莫斯科电台现在正在谈论什么苏日之间维护和平利益的“联合行动”。苏联《新时代》杂志则鼓吹苏日关系的改善符合“巩固远东和世界和平”的利益。但是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的任何蛊惑性宣传都掩盖不了日本政府的反动性。正在复活日本军国主义的佐藤政府是奉行着投靠美帝国主义和为日本垄断资本效劳的政策。
