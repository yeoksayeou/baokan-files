　　“Our Good County Party Secretary!”
　　Old poor peasant of Xugongzhuang Production Team, Chengguan Commune, Sun Yutang
　　Our Xugongzhuang is an old disaster area, plagued by sand, alkali, and waterlogging. In 1962, we had several heavy rains in a row, flooding everything. The fields were full of nothing but knee-high cogongrass. That year, the lives of the commune members were very difficult! Luckily, our country distributed relief grain, and we got through the famine. Since the production team started a brick kiln sideline business in 1962, the lives of the commune members have gradually improved. Everyone thought: in the past, we relied on the state to transfer grain from all directions; if all disaster-stricken production teams relied on state relief, where would our country get so much grain? From 1963 onwards, we resolutely relied on our own hands, practiced self-reliance, and didn't want a single grain of relief from the state.
　　In the spring of 1963, one morning, Secretary Jiao came to our village. He asked the production team leader, Song Baozhong, "Old Song, what do you think of the lives of the commune members?" Song Baozhong said, "I think they can eat their fill, no problem." As they spoke, they arrived at the home of poor peasant Wang Tingbi. As soon as he saw Wang Tingbi, he asked, "Old Wang, are there any difficulties in life? What are you eating?" Wang Tingbi replied, "We have sorghum and sweet potato slices, it's okay!" After visiting a few homes, Secretary Jiao returned to the county.
　　It was just noon, and we adults and children were holding our bowls and eating when, to our surprise, Secretary Jiao came to Wang Tingbi's house again! Only when he saw with his own eyes that Wang Tingbi's family was eating sorghum steamed buns was he relieved.
　　On the road, he met eighty-year-old poor peasant Song Dehe, and he stopped to ask him how his life was, and told him, "Old man, with our Communist Party, we must take good care of the lives of the poor and lower-middle peasants and not let you go hungry or freeze."
　　Then, he came to the home of military dependent Jia Fushen. As soon as he entered the door, Secretary Jiao said with a smile, "I'm here to inspect the hygiene!" With that, he lifted the lid of the pot and saw more than a dozen sorghum vegetable buns and corn cakes in the pot. He laughed heartily and said repeatedly, "Good! Good!" That noon, he went all over the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the entire village.
　　Secretary Jiao often said to everyone, our commune members cannot rely solely on sideline occupations; we must cure the "three pests" and improve agriculture. Whenever he had time, he would walk back and forth on the dam in our village. After looking, he would discuss with everyone how to dig drainage ditches, and personally teach us how to dig terraced fields to control saline-alkali land, and also said, "The terrain of this village is too low-lying, and the houses of the commune members must be moved to the side of the dam." What a good County Party Secretary he is!
　　The winter ground was frozen half a foot deep. We bought hard picks and went to dig the river in the face of the cold wind. After digging for several days in a row, my hands cracked with five cuts. I don't think it's anything. Thinking of Secretary Jiao, in order to completely change the face of our Lankao County, even if I cracked more cuts, I would do it to the end.

　　“咱们的好县委书记！”
　　城关公社许贡庄生产队老贫农　孙玉堂
    俺许贡庄是个老灾区，沙、碱、涝样样都有。一九六二年连着下了几场大雨，淹得什么都没有了，地里长的尽是没膝高的茅草。那一年，社员的生活可难啦！幸亏咱国家发了救济粮才度过了荒。自打一九六二年生产队办了烧窑副业，社员们的生活就慢慢好转了。大伙儿就合计：过去咱们尽指着国家从四面八方给调粮食，要是全国受灾的生产队全指着国家救济，咱国家哪来这么多粮食？从一九六三年起，咱们就坚决靠自己的双手，搞自力更生，不要国家救济一粒粮。
    一九六三年春，一天上午，焦书记来到俺村，他问生产队长宋保忠：“老宋，你看社员的生活咋样？”宋保忠说：“我看能吃饱，没啥问题。”他们说着，到了贫农王廷碧家。一见王廷碧，他就问：“老王，生活有困难吗？吃啥呢？”王廷碧答道：“有高粱、红薯片，能行啊！”看了几家，焦书记就回县里去了。
    刚到中午，俺们大人小孩正端着碗吃饭呢，谁知焦书记又到王廷碧家来啦！当他亲眼看到王廷碧一家在吃高粱馍馍，才算放了心。
    在路上，他遇到八十岁的贫农宋德和老汉，就站下问他生活怎样，还对他说：“老人家，有咱共产党，一定要把贫下中农的生活照顾好，不让你们饿着冻着。”
    接着，又来到军属贾富申家。一进门，焦书记就笑着说：“我来检查卫生啦！”说罢，他掀开锅一看，锅里放着十好几个高粱菜馍和窝窝头，他才哈哈笑着，连声说：“好啊！好啊！”这天中午，他转遍了全村的贫下中农户。
    焦书记常常对大伙说，咱社员不能尽指着副业过，一定要治好“三害”，搞好农业。一有空，他就在俺村的大堤上转来转去。看罢，就同大伙儿一起研究怎样挖排水沟，又亲自教咱们挖台田治盐碱，还说：“这村地势太洼，得把社员们的房屋挪到大堤边。”这是个多么好的县委书记啊！
    冬天的地冻得半尺深，俺们买了硬镐，冒着寒风去挖河。连着挖了几天，俺的手上裂了五道口子，俺觉得不算啥。想起焦书记，为了彻底改变咱兰考县的面貌，就是裂更多道口子，俺也要干到底。
