    Be the People's Ox, Pull the Cart for the People for a Lifetime
    Zhou Mingshan, Secretary of the Jiang County Party Committee, Resolves to Learn from Comrade Jiao Yulu
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, February 11th – Zhou Mingshan, recently promoted from the position of Party Branch Secretary of a brigade to Secretary of the Jiang County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said that he must take Jiao Yulu as an example, be the people's ox, and pull the cart for the people for a lifetime.
    Zhou Mingshan read the lengthy article introducing Jiao Yulu's deeds four times in a row. He said, "I was educated and nurtured by the Party. Just as I became the County Party Secretary, Comrade Jiao Yulu set a brilliant example for me on how to be a good County Party Secretary. His spirit is the spirit of a proletarian revolutionary fighter armed with Mao Zedong Thought. If we learn from his spirit, there will be no difficulties we cannot overcome and no tasks we cannot complete." He said, "From 1957 to 1965, I served as the Party Branch Secretary of Nanliu Brigade in Nanfan Commune, Jiang County for nine years, but I did not learn more revolutionary spirit from the working people. Compared with Comrade Jiao Yulu, he is great, and I am insignificant."
    Zhou Mingshan said, "Learning from the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, I found three gaps: First, I haven't put enough effort into the 'application' aspect of studying Chairman Mao's works, using it more to transform the objective world and less to transform the subjective world; second, compared to Comrade Jiao Yulu, I am a 'caretaker,' and although I have been working hard in the past few years, I have not tapped the water source of Nanliu Brigade; third, I have not properly taken over the revolutionary spirit and revolutionary experience of the revolutionary predecessors, and I have not shown enough determination in the face of major revolutionary tasks. In the future, I must take Jiao Yulu as an example, study Chairman Mao's works well, conscientiously transform my thinking, completely become the people's ox, pull the cart for the people for a lifetime, fight alongside the people, change the sky of Jiang County, transform the land of Jiang County, and contribute everything I have to the revolution." Zhou Mingshan made these remarks at a symposium held by the Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the 10th to study Comrade Jiao Yulu.

    当人民的牛  给人民拉一辈子车
    绛县县委书记周明山决心向焦裕禄同志学习
    新华社太原十一日电　新近由大队党支部书记被提拔为中共绛县县委书记的周明山说，他一定要以焦裕禄为榜样，当人民的牛，给人民拉一辈子车。
    周明山把介绍焦裕禄事迹的长篇通讯一连读了四遍。他说：“我是党一手教养出来的，刚当县委书记，焦裕禄同志给我当好县委书记树立了一个光辉的榜样。他的精神，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命战士的精神。我们学习他的精神，就没有克服不了的困难，没有完不成的任务。”他说：“从一九五七年到一九六五年，我在绛县南樊公社南柳大队当了九年党支部书记，却没有从劳动人民那里学到更多的革命精神。和焦裕禄同志比，他伟大，我渺小。”
    周明山说：“学习焦裕禄同志的事迹，我找到了三个差距：第一是我学习毛主席著作在‘用’字上下功夫不够，用在改造客观世界上的多，用在改造主观世界上的少；第二是和焦裕禄同志比起来，我是个‘守业派’，几年来，虽然也在努力工作，但没有把南柳大队的水挖出来；第三是我没有把革命前辈的革命精神和革命经验好好地接过来，在重大的革命任务面前表现的决心不大。今后，我一定要以焦裕禄为榜样，好好学习毛主席著作，认真改造思想，彻底当人民的牛，给人民拉一辈子车，和人民一起战斗，改绛县天，换绛县地，为革命贡献我的一切。”周明山是十日在中共晋南地委举行的学习焦裕禄同志座谈会上说这番话的。
