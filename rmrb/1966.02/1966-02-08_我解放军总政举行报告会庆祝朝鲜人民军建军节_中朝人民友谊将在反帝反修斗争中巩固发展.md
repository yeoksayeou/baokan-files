    Xinhua News Agency, February 7th—To celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a report meeting this afternoon.
    Colonel Choi Jae-ryong, Military Attaché of the Korean Embassy in China, was invited to give a report at the meeting. Kim Soo-jong, Second Secretary of the Embassy, and others were also invited to attend.
    The report meeting was presided over by Liang Biye, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In his speech, he praised the Korean People's Army as a heroic army with revolutionary traditions, stating that this heroic people's army has made great contributions to safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world in the struggle against the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war. He said that there is a profound friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea. This friendship is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, has been tested by storms, and is unbreakable. We firmly believe that in the future struggle against U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism, this fraternal fighting friendship will be further consolidated and developed.
    In his report, Colonel Choi Jae-ryong first described the glorious fighting course of the Korean People's Army and the new achievements and experiences it has made in revolutionary and modernization construction. He strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for flagrantly trampling on the Korean Armistice Agreement, turning South Korea into a base for atomic weapons and rockets, intensifying provocative activities against the Korean people, and frantically preparing to provoke a new war of aggression. He said that U.S. imperialists manufactured the criminal "South Korea-Japan Treaty," and under its protection, the Japanese militarists and the South Korean puppet clique colluded with each other. Colonel Choi Jae-ryong emphasized that we must drive U.S. imperialism out of our territory and realize the independent reunification of the motherland.
    Colonel Choi Jae-ryong condemned U.S. imperialism for occupying China's territory of Taiwan and constantly carrying out provocative activities against the Chinese people. He also condemned U.S. imperialism for frantically expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam.
    In talking about the friendship between the people and armies of China and Korea, he said that as always, in the future struggle against U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism, the Korean people and the Korean People's Army will closely join hands and advance shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    Participating in the report meeting were responsible cadres from the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, various services and arms, the Beijing Military Region leadership organs, as well as representatives of officers and soldiers from the army, navy, and air force, totaling more than 800 people.

    中朝人民友谊将在反帝反修斗争中巩固发展
    据新华社七日讯　为庆祝朝鲜人民军建军十八周年，中国人民解放军总政治部今天下午举行报告会。
    朝鲜驻中国大使馆武官崔济荣上校应邀在会上作了报告。大使馆二等秘书金寿钟等，也应邀出席。
    报告会由中国人民解放军总政治部副主任梁必业主持。他在讲话中，赞扬朝鲜人民军是有革命传统的英雄军队，这支英雄的人民军队在反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的斗争中，对捍卫远东和世界和平做出了巨大的贡献。他说，中朝两国人民和军队之间有着深厚的友谊。这种友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的，是经过惊涛骇浪考验过的，是牢不可破的。我们坚信，在今后反对美帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争中，这种兄弟般的战斗友谊，必将得到进一步的巩固和发展。
    崔济荣上校在报告中首先叙述了朝鲜人民军的光荣斗争历程和在革命化、现代化建设上所取得的新的成就和经验。他强烈谴责美帝国主义悍然蹂躏朝鲜停战协定，把南朝鲜变成了原子武器和火箭基地，加紧进行反对朝鲜人民的挑衅活动，疯狂地准备挑起新的侵略战争。他说，美帝国主义者制造罪恶的“韩日条约”，在它的庇护下，使日本军国主义和南朝鲜傀儡集团勾结起来。崔济荣上校强调说，我们一定要把美帝国主义赶出我们的疆土，实现祖国的自主统一。
    崔济荣上校谴责美帝国主义霸占中国的领土台湾，不断地对中国人民进行挑衅活动。他还谴责美帝国主义疯狂扩大侵略越南战争。
    他在谈到中朝两国人民和军队的友谊时说，我们一如既往，今后在反对美帝国主义，反对现代修正主义的斗争中，朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军同中国人民和中国人民解放军紧密携手并肩前进。
