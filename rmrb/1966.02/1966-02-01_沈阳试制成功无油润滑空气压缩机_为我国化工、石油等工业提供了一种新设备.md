    Shenyang Successfully Trials Oil-Free Lubricated Air Compressor
    Providing New Equipment for China's Chemical, Petroleum, and Other Industries
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang – China's first oil-free lubricated air compressor has recently been successfully trialed by the Shenyang Gas Compressor Factory and has already begun production.
    In the past, gas compressors produced in China used lubricating oil to lubricate the piston rings and seals, resulting in the compressed gas containing lubricating oil. In order to obtain pure gas, improve product quality and yield, and extend the service life of the air compressor's operating instruments, users had to add a complex and expensive purification device. The newly manufactured oil-free lubricated air compressor uses a special material for the piston rings and seals that is wear-resistant, high-temperature resistant, and self-lubricating. Its advantage is that it can directly provide pure compressed air without the need for an additional purification device. This provides a relatively ideal gas compression equipment for China's chemical, petroleum, textile, food, pharmaceutical, and other industries.
    The use of oil-free lubrication in air compressors is a new technology that has only emerged internationally in recent years. With the strong assistance of relevant scientific research departments, the workers of the Shenyang Gas Compressor Factory, displaying the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and daring to act, designed and manufactured it successfully in a relatively short period.

    沈阳试制成功无油润滑空气压缩机
    为我国化工、石油等工业提供了一种新设备
    新华社沈阳电　我国第一台无油润滑空气压缩机，最近由沈阳气体压缩机厂试制成功，并且已开始投入生产。
    我国过去生产的气体压缩机，都是用润滑油来润滑活塞环和密封圈的，压缩出来的气体里含有润滑油的成份。用户为了取得纯净的气体，以提高产品的质量和收率，延长空气压缩机操纵仪表的使用寿命，不得不增设一套复杂而昂贵的净化装置。新制成的无油润滑空气压缩机，活塞环和密封圈是选用一种耐磨、耐高温、并能自行润滑的特殊材料做成的。它的优点是不需要另外增设一套净化装置，就可以直接提供纯净的压缩空气。这样就为我国化工、石油、纺织、食品、医药等工业，提供了比较理想的气体压缩设备。
    空气压缩机采用无油润滑，是最近几年才在国际上出现的一项新技术。沈阳气体压缩机厂职工在有关科学研究部门的大力协助下，发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，只用比较短的时间就设计和制造成功。
