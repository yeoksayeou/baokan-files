　　Office in a Reed Mat Shed
　　At the end of 1956, Jiao Yulu returned from his internship at the Dalian Crane Factory and became the director of a metalworking workshop. At that time, because the workshop had not yet been completed, some comrades in the workshop were working in the dormitory area more than a mile away from the factory. Jiao Yulu felt that this was very inconvenient for work, so he found an old reed mat shed left over from construction in the factory and asked everyone to move the office to the reed mat shed. Some comrades said: "It's so cold, the reed mat shed is drafty everywhere, how can we work?"
　　Jiao Yulu replied: "Although the reed mat shed is a bit cold, it is much more convenient to work in. As long as it is beneficial to the work, what does it matter if it is a bit cold? We cannot be afraid of hardship when we do revolution. Besides, we can still make a fire when it's cold!"
　　Hearing him say this, everyone's thinking became clear, and they happily moved the office into the reed mat shed.
　　After moving to the reed mat shed to work, Jiao Yulu was even more considerate of everyone. No matter if it was windy or snowy, he always arrived early every morning to start the fire first. When the comrades came to work, they would see the red stove fire burning brightly, but Comrade Jiao Yulu was not warming himself by the stove, but was wholeheartedly reading Chairman Mao's works at his own desk.

　　席棚办公
    一九五六年年底，焦裕禄从大连起重机厂实习回来，就在一金工车间当主任。当时，由于车间还没有建成，车间的一些同志便在离厂一里多路的宿舍区办公。焦裕禄感到这样工作起来很不方便，就在厂子里找了一个施工时留下的旧席棚，要求大家把办公地点搬到席棚去。有个别同志说：“天这么冷，席棚四处透风，怎么能工作呢？”
    焦裕禄回答说：“席棚虽然冷一点，但工作起来却方便得多，只要对工作有利，冷一点又算得什么。我们干革命就不能怕吃苦。再说，天冷还可以生火么！”
    听他这么一说，大家思想通了，就愉快地把办公室搬进了席棚子里。
    搬到席棚办公后，焦裕禄更是处处为大家着想，无论刮风下雪，每天清晨，他总是来的早早的，先把火给生着，同志们一来上班，便看到火红的炉火熊熊正旺，但焦裕禄同志却不在炉旁烤火，而是在他自己的办公桌前专心致志地阅读毛主席著作呢。
