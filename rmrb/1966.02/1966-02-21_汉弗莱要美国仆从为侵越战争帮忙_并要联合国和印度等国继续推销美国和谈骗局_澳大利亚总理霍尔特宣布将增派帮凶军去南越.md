　　Humphrey Wants U.S. Lackeys to Help with the War of Aggression Against Vietnam
　　And Wants the United Nations and Countries Like India to Continue Peddling the U.S. Peace Talk Deception
　　Australian Prime Minister Holt Announces That More Accomplice Troops Will Be Sent to South Vietnam
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Canberra, February 20th: U.S. Vice President Humphrey concluded his two-day visit to Australia on the 20th. He arrived in Canberra on the 19th, after activities in South Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Pakistan, and India, to continue peddling the U.S. plan for aggression against Vietnam, particularly to get Australia to provide more cannon fodder for the U.S.

    As reported, during Humphrey's talks with Australian Prime Minister Holt, the main issue discussed was Australia sending more troops to participate in the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. At a joint press conference held after the talks, Humphrey clamored that the U.S. must fight the war of aggression against Vietnam to the end, and emphasized that the U.S. believes that "free countries must participate" in the so-called "resistance to communist aggression in Vietnam," that is, other countries must help save the U.S. from defeat in South Vietnam.

    At this press conference, Holt announced that Australia would send more lackey troops to South Vietnam. He said, "For some time, we have been considering what more Australia can do in Vietnam," "We hope to announce soon what actions Australia can take to supplement our current forces in South Vietnam." Humphrey greatly praised Holt's statement that the Australian government would further act as an accomplice in the war of aggression against Vietnam. He said, "The Australian government will take the actions it believes it can take. We in the United States trust its judgment."

    Humphrey also indicated that while the U.S. is trying to drag some countries into the water in order to further expand the war, it will continue to push the "peace talk" deception. He said that the U.S. will continue to make every effort through the United Nations, bilateral talks, and the mediation of countries such as India to promote "honorable negotiations." He said that in New Delhi, Indian government leaders told him that India would strengthen its efforts as a "mediator" to promote "negotiations for a peaceful resolution of the Vietnam War." Humphrey said that he had asked the Indian government to continue its "mediation" and, as a member of the International Supervisory Committee, to try to reconvene a "Geneva-style conference."

　　汉弗莱要美国仆从为侵越战争帮忙
　　并要联合国和印度等国继续推销美国和谈骗局
　　澳大利亚总理霍尔特宣布将增派帮凶军去南越
    据新华社二十日讯　堪培拉消息：美国副总统汉弗莱二十日结束了在澳大利亚的两天访问。他是在南越、泰国、老挝、巴基斯坦和印度活动后十九日来到堪培拉继续兜售美国的侵越计划，特别是要澳大利亚为美国提供更多的侵越炮灰的。
    据报道，在汉弗莱同澳大利亚总理霍尔特会谈时，关于澳大利亚更多地派兵参加美国侵越战争，是他们讨论的主要问题。在会谈结束后举行的联合记者招待会上，汉弗莱竭力叫嚷美国要把侵越战争打到底，并强调美国认为“自由国家必须参加”所谓“抵抗共产党在越南的侵略”，也就是要其他国家帮助挽救美国在南越的败局。
    霍尔特在这个记者招待会上宣布，澳大利亚将要增派仆从军到南越。他说，“若干时期以来我们一直在考虑澳大利亚在越南还能作些什么”，“我们希望不久就能宣布澳大利亚所能采取的行动来补充我们目前在南越的部队。”对于霍尔特表示澳大利亚政府要进一步充当侵越战争的帮凶的话，汉弗莱大加赞扬。他说，“澳大利亚政府将采取它认为它能采取的行动。我们美国信任它的判断。”
    汉弗莱还表明，美国在设法拉一些国家下水以便进一步扩大战争的时候，还将继续推行“和谈”骗局。他说，美国将继续通过联合国、双边会谈和印度等国的斡旋作出一切努力来促成“体面的谈判”。他说，在新德里，印度政府领导人对他说，印度将加强作为“调解人”的努力以促成“和平解决越南战争的谈判”。汉弗莱说，他已要求印度政府继续进行“斡旋”，并且作为国际监督委员会委员设法重新召开“日内瓦式的会议”。
