　　“Playing the Movie Back”
　　Seven Praises of Jiao Yulu
  　Ai Bai
    Comrade Jiao Yulu is a good student of Chairman Mao. How did he study Chairman Mao's works? He said, "During the day, I go to the masses to investigate and visit. When I come back, I read Chairman Mao's works. At night, I 'play the movie back', and in the morning, I take notes."
    What does "playing the movie back" mean? It refers to thinking about problems in connection with reality. So he said, "Whether in study or work, it is impossible to do without 'playing the movie back'."
    If we want to study Chairman Mao's works, and learn and apply them creatively, we must connect them with reality. Comrade Jiao Yulu learned and applied Chairman Mao's works creatively because he was able to connect them with reality, able to "play the movie back." Reality, like a movie, unfolds scene after scene, act after act before his eyes. He uses the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the "target" of reality, and can achieve unfailing accuracy.
    However, being able to "play the movie back" is not an easy task. First of all, if you want to "play the movie back," your mind must be imprinted with scene after scene of the "movie," that is to say, you must first understand reality, and go to reality to investigate and study. Only in this way will there be a "movie" in your mind, instead of a blank screen, empty and devoid of anything. Otherwise, if you want to play the "movie," you won't be able to "play" it. Why was Comrade Jiao Yulu able to "play the movie back"? Look, he traveled to more than 120 of the 149 large teams in Lankao County within a year and a half. Aren't these large teams like scene after scene of the "movie," "playing" before his eyes? If he hadn't run to these large teams, it would not have been possible to better connect with reality.
    What kind of "movie" to "play back"? There are also differences. There are new and old movie films, and reality is also new and old. The reality of ten years ago is different from that of ten years later; the reality of last year is also different from that of this year; the reality of yesterday is not exactly the same as that of today. "Playing the movie back" cannot "play back" old films, but must "play back" new films. Some comrades did indeed understand reality very well in the past, and often ran among the masses. The reality in their minds is just some old films. If they want to "play back" new films, they cannot "play" them. If they want to "play back" new films, they must understand the current reality, and must often go to reality. Comrade Jiao Yulu "went to the masses during the day" and "played the movie back at night." This film can be said to be the newest film, and connecting with this kind of reality can be said to be the closest.
    Going to reality will indeed imprint scene after scene of the "movie" in your mind. However, the film must be edited to highlight the theme. Reality must also be analyzed to find the main contradictions. In this way, we can study Chairman Mao's works with questions, instead of "playing the movie back" aimlessly. Comrade Jiao Yulu brought back a series of questions from reality and went to Chairman Mao's works to find the answers.
    "Playing the movie back" is different from watching a movie after all. People watch movies without regarding it as a kind of labor. However, Comrade Jiao Yulu's "playing the movie back" is arduous thinking, arduous theory connecting with reality, and arduous ideological labor. Therefore, to seriously "play the movie back," one must have the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, and must have the qualities of a proletarian revolutionary fighter. Otherwise, one will either not "play the movie back," or one will not "play the movie back" well.

### “过电影”  七赞焦裕禄

　　“过电影”
　　七赞焦裕禄
  　艾白
    焦裕禄同志是毛主席的好学生。他是怎样学习毛主席著作的呢？他说：“白天到群众中调查访问，回来读毛主席著作，晚上‘过电影’，早上记笔记。”
    “过电影”，是什么意思呢？就是指联系实际来思考问题。所以他说，“无论学习和工作，不会‘过电影’是不行的。”
    我们要学习毛主席著作，要活学活用，就必须联系实际。焦裕禄同志把毛主席的著作学活了，也用活了，就是因为他能够联系实际，能够“过电影”。实际，正如电影似的，一幕又一幕，一场又一场在他的眼前展开。他用毛泽东思想之“矢”，来射实际之“的”，就能做到矢无虚发。
    然而，要能“过电影”，也并不是容易的事。首先，你要“过电影”，头脑里必须印上了一幕一幕的“电影”，也就是说，先要了解实际，要到实际中去调查研究。这样一来，头脑里才有了“电影”，而不是一幅白白的银幕，空无所有。不然，你要过“电影”，也“过”不起来。焦裕禄同志为什么能“过电影”呢？你看，兰考全县一百四十九个大队，他在一年多时间内，跑遍了一百二十多个。这些大队不正如一幕一幕的“电影”，在他的眼前“过”吗？要是不跑这些大队，就不可能去更好地联系实际。
    “过”什么“电影”？也有区别。电影片子有新有旧，实际也有新有旧。十年前的实际，同十年后不同；去年的实际，同今年也不同；昨天的实际，同今天也不尽相同。“过电影”，不能“过”旧片子，要“过”新片子才行。有的同志，过去的确也很了解实际，经常在群众中跑。他头脑中的实际，只是一些旧片子。要“过”新片子，就“过”不起来。要“过”新片子，就必须了解当前的实际，必须经常到实际中去。焦裕禄同志“白天到群众中去”，“晚上过电影”，这片子可以说是最新的片子了，联系这样的实际，可以说是最紧密的了。
    到了实际中去，的确会使头脑中印下了一幕幕“电影”。然而，影片要经过剪辑，才能突出主题。对实际也要分析，找出主要矛盾。这样，才能带着问题去学毛主席著作，而不是漫无边际地去“过电影”。焦裕禄同志正是从实际中带回一连串的问题，到毛主席的著作中去找答案的。
    “过电影”毕竟同看电影不同。人们去看电影，不把它当作是一种劳动。然而，焦裕禄同志的“过电影”，却是艰苦的思索，艰苦的理论联系实际，艰苦的思想劳动。所以，要认真去“过电影”，必须有全心全意为人民服务的精神，必须有无产阶级革命战士的品质。不然的话，不是不去“过电影”，就是“过电影”也过不好。
