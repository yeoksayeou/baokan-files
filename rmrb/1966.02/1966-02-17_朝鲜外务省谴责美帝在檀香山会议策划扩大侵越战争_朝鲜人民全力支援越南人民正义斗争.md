    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 16th (电) -- According to reports in the newspapers here on the 16th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 15th, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to further expand its war of aggression against Vietnam at the Honolulu Conference.

    The statement said that the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to expand its war of aggression against Vietnam at the Honolulu Conference is a new act of aggression against the Vietnamese people and a grave challenge to the people of socialist countries and peace-loving people all over the world.

    The statement said that the so-called "military plans" discussed by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys at the Honolulu Conference, as well as Johnson's open declaration after the meeting that he would increase troops to South Vietnam according to the demands of the U.S. military commander in South Vietnam, and Vice President Humphrey's activities in Saigon and other parts of Asia, all show that U.S. imperialism is attempting to more comprehensively expand its war of aggression against Vietnam. The statement said that U.S. imperialists' vigorous promotion at the Honolulu Conference of "economic stabilization plans," "rural construction plans," and "health and education plans" in South Vietnam are nothing more than deceptive tactics, the purpose of which is to conceal from world opinion the U.S. attempt to permanently occupy South Vietnam and impose the fate of colonial slaves on the people of South Vietnam.

    The statement said that Johnson is attempting to use the Honolulu Conference to support the traitorous clique rejected by the Vietnamese people in order to "legalize" the American war of aggression against Vietnam. However, this is a foolish attempt. The South Vietnamese puppet clique represents no one. As the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has pointed out, all "promises" made by the United States to the South Vietnamese puppets are invalid.

    The statement said that the Korean government and the entire Korean people fully support the statements issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on the Honolulu Conference and strongly condemn U.S. imperialism's policy of expanding the war.

    The statement said that if U.S. imperialism, disregarding the demands of the Vietnamese people and the unanimous wishes of peace-loving people around the world, stubbornly insists on expanding its war of aggression, it will only accelerate its own demise. The heroic Vietnamese people, fighting to defend national independence and sovereignty, will surely drive the U.S. imperialist aggressors from the land of Vietnam and achieve final victory.

    The statement concluded by saying that the Korean government and the entire Korean people will continue to do everything in their power to more actively support the Vietnamese people's just struggle in the future and fight to the end alongside the Vietnamese people against the common enemy, the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

    朝鲜外务省谴责美帝在檀香山会议策划扩大侵越战争
    朝鲜人民全力支援越南人民正义斗争
    新华社平壤十六日电　据这里报纸十六日报道，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省十五日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义在檀香山会议上策划进一步扩大侵略越南战争的阴谋。
    声明说，美帝国主义在檀香山会议上策划的扩大侵略越南战争的阴谋，是对越南人民的新的侵略行为，是对社会主义各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的严重挑战。
    声明说，美帝国主义及其走狗在檀香山会议上讨论的所谓“军事计划”，以及会后约翰逊公然声称将根据驻越南南方美军司令的要求向越南南方增兵，美国副总统汉弗莱到西贡和亚洲其他地区活动等等事实，都说明了美帝国主义企图更加全面地扩大侵略越南的战争。声明说，美帝国主义者在檀香山会议上大肆宣扬将在越南南方执行“稳定经济计划”、“乡村建设计划”和“关于保健、教育计划”等，都只不过是一种欺骗手段，其目的是为了在世界舆论面前掩盖美国企图永远霸占越南南方和把殖民地奴隶的命运强加给越南南方人民的阴谋。
    声明说，约翰逊企图通过檀香山会议扶植遭到越南人民唾弃的卖国集团，以便使美国侵略越南的战争“合法化”。但是，这是愚蠢的企图。南越傀儡集团代表不了任何人。正如越南民主共和国政府所指出的，美国对南越傀儡许下的一切“诺言”都是无效的。
    声明说，朝鲜政府和全体朝鲜人民完全支持越南民主共和国外交部和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会就檀香山会议发表的声明，并且强烈谴责美帝国主义扩大战争的政策。
    声明说，如果美帝国主义悍然不顾越南人民的要求和世界爱好和平人民的一致愿望，硬要扩大侵略战争，那么，只能加速它自己的灭亡。为捍卫国家独立和主权而斗争的英雄的越南人民，一定将把美帝国主义侵略者从越南的土地上赶出去，取得最后胜利。
    声明最后说，朝鲜政府和全体朝鲜人民，今后仍将继续尽一切力量更加积极地支援越南人民的正义斗争，为反对共同敌人美帝国主义侵略者，同越南人民并肩战斗到底。
