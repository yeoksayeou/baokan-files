    Soviet-U.S. cooperation dominating the world is the soul of Khrushchev's revisionist line. After the new Soviet leadership came to power, they tried hard to show that they were different from Khrushchev, putting on an anti-American appearance in an attempt to conceal the essence of their continued pursuit of this line. However, more and more facts show that they are doing more thoroughly and going further than Khrushchev in Soviet-U.S. cooperation.
    The new Soviet leadership is very annoyed by the exposure of their true colors by Marxists-Leninists. They hurled abuse, saying that our articles exposing them are full of "baseless defamatory and provocative fabrications." ①
    Curses and sophistry cannot change the facts. The new Soviet leadership's numerous statements and actual actions, their newspaper articles, reveal themselves every day. The batch of books published by the new Soviet leadership in 1965 that promote Soviet-U.S. cooperation is also a clear example. Among this batch of books, "The Dynamics of American Foreign Policy" and "The Soviet Union and the United States - Their Political and Economic Relations" are two representative ones.
    What are the main arguments of these two books?
    "The Dynamics of American Foreign Policy" was edited and published by the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1965. Although this book cannot but mention certain facts about American foreign aggression and say some words accusing American aggression, it tries to prove that these bad things were done by the reactionary faction of the American monopoly bourgeoisie, while the leaders of U.S. imperialism, who also represent the monopoly bourgeoisie, do not belong to the reactionary faction. That is to say, the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism can be changed. Condemning U.S. imperialism is just a superficial trick, and concealing the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism is the essence of the whole book.
    This book divides the American ruling group into two factions: "calm and sensible" and "belligerent and aggressive." The book says, "The struggle between adventurous and aggressive trends and calm and sensible trends in foreign policy and military policy is increasingly sweeping through the ranks of the real rulers of the United States - the largest domestic monopoly organizations." The book also says, "Two foreign policy trends in American social life, namely the struggle between two groups - the extremely reactionary and wildly aggressive faction and the moderate and calm faction that tends to assess the existing balance of power wisely and tends to peaceful coexistence - has reached its climax."
    Who are these "moderate and calm factions that tend to peaceful coexistence"? According to this book, they are the heads of U.S. imperialism, the successive U.S. presidents after the war. The book says that Eisenhower "represents the more moderate people who have no intention of implementing their adventurous propositions and risking a major war"; Kennedy was a "popular" president who "had a broad vision and calmly dealt with the urgent problems of international life" and "understood the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence"; Johnson is a "very prudent and moderate politician" who "does not tend to political adventures" and "received an absolute mandate from the people to implement a policy aimed at consolidating peace, eliminating the 'Cold War,' and seeking Soviet-U.S. rapprochement."
    How could these war criminals suddenly become peace-loving people? How could these enemies of the people suddenly become popular presidents? The book's whitewashing of the heads of U.S. imperialism is nothing more than promoting the merchandise of Soviet-U.S. "peaceful coexistence" and "peaceful competition." The book says, "The American ruling class has more or less begun to understand that the decisive arena of struggle in the current world class forces is peaceful economic competition." In the "nuclear century," "only lunatics, only suicides, can use war as an instrument of their policy," and "the U.S. government has shown a willingness to compromise in many cases." The book says that as long as the Soviet Union and the United States "peacefully coexist," "then the competition between the two socio-economic systems and the ideological struggle between the two major rivals on the international stage will be limited to a broad range of economic, diplomatic, scientific, and cultural competition and cooperation without bloodshed and war."
    This book declares that "Soviet-U.S. relations, the relations between the two strongest countries in the world, are the axis of world politics and the main basis of international peace." The book quotes U.S. Secretary of State Rusk, advocating the "special responsibility of the two major countries - the Soviet Union and the United States - for the fate of the world and the fate of mankind." The book says that the Soviet Union "is committed to peace and cooperation with the United States and believes that Soviet-U.S. relations are the primary issue in contemporary world politics and the key to the issue of war and peace."
    So, will U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, bombing of the socialist Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and massacre of the Vietnamese people hinder Soviet-U.S. relations? According to this book, it will not. Even in this case, there is no conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. This book emphasizes the "very important characteristic of Soviet-U.S. relations," which is the so-called "commonality of national interests between the two countries." The book says, "Apart from the stain of American participation in the military intervention against Soviet Russia from 1918 to 1920, Russian-American and Soviet-American relations have not been overshadowed by any military conflicts and the clouds of war." "Even now, there are no territorial or economic disputes and conflicts between the two countries, and their national interests do not conflict with each other, either worldwide or in any local area."
    "The Soviet Union and the United States - Their Political and Economic Relations" was published in 1965 with the approval of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. This book discusses the history of Soviet-U.S. relations from the October Revolution to World War II. It cannot but mention the historical facts of American aggression and hostility towards the Soviet Union, but its focus is still on Soviet-U.S. cooperation. It emphasizes that "the Soviet Union's policy aimed at establishing comprehensive cooperation with the United States is unchanged."
    In order to defend the new Soviet leadership's policy of Soviet-U.S. "comprehensive cooperation," this book does not hesitate to distort history, insisting that "the Soviet state has consistently pursued a policy of comprehensive cooperation with the United States since its inception," and that "the history of Soviet-U.S. relations from 1917 to 1941 convincingly shows that peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States is in the interests of the Soviet and American people, as well as the people of other countries." The book also says that "Soviet-U.S. cooperation during World War II created favorable conditions for ending the unrealistic and short-sighted anti-Soviet policy of the American ruling group before the war and for developing effective Soviet-U.S. relations in the post-war period."
    In order to create a basis for the policy of Soviet-U.S. cooperation, this book vigorously trumpets that the current American ruling group is peace-loving. The book says that now "the more far-sighted and clear-headed representatives of the influential groups in the United States advocate a more realistic foreign policy," and that "they clearly understand that in the current international situation, the only acceptable basis for cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union is peaceful coexistence and competition in economic, scientific, technological, cultural, and other fields."
    This book emphasizes that "the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have consistently believed that the normalization of Soviet-U.S. relations is of paramount importance." The book cites this point from the resolution of the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on Khrushchev's report: "Improving Soviet-U.S. relations will play a decisive role in promoting the healthy development of the international situation, because the Soviet Union and the United States are two countries that bear special responsibility for the fate of universal peace."
    People can clearly see that the tone of these two books is exactly the same as Khrushchev's remarks. Khrushchev said that "the entire international situation largely depends on what kind of relationship is established between the United States and the Soviet Union," ② that "history has placed a huge responsibility for the fate of the world on the people of our two countries," ③ and that the "interests" of the Soviet Union and the United States "do not directly conflict anywhere, whether on territorial issues or in economic terms," and that "we can coexist completely." ④ Khrushchev's disciples are just copying what their master said.
    Obviously, these books are entirely written in accordance with the revisionist line of the 20th, 21st, and 22nd Congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the program of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The words in the books are what the new Soviet leadership wants to say. The publication of these books once again proves that the new Soviet leadership is pursuing Khrushchevism without Khrushchev, proves that their idea of Soviet-U.S. cooperation is not accidental but consistent, and their pursuit of Soviet-U.S. cooperation is not an individual act but a fundamental line. These books are the confession of the new Soviet leadership in pursuing the Soviet-U.S. cooperation line.
    At first glance, these two books spend a lot of space narrating the aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism and scolding the reactionaries in the United States. However, as long as you look closely, it is not difficult to find that the books only generally condemn U.S. imperialism, while they do their utmost to praise the people in power in the American ruling group. Although the books express the Soviet Union's opposition to American aggression, in the end, they always beg for Soviet-U.S. cooperation. This kind of small scolding and big help is nothing more than to deceive the Soviet people and the people of the world and to better serve U.S. imperialism.
    These two books have attracted people's attention. They are good negative examples. They expose the various deceptive tricks now played by the new Soviet leadership.
    The new Soviet leadership says that they are opposed to U.S. imperialism. What is the truth? It was precisely in 1965, when U.S. imperialism was frantically expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, that they published such a batch of books promoting Soviet-U.S. cooperation, declaring that "the Soviet Union's policy aimed at establishing comprehensive cooperation with the United States is unchanged." The Soviet leaders themselves also came forward many times and personally stated this point. Brezhnev, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said in May 1965 that "we advocate developing and improving relations with the United States." ⑤ Kosygin, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, said in an interview with Reston of "The New York Times" in December 1965 that the main thing for the Soviet Union and the United States "from a long-term perspective should be to organize all forces to resist war," and that the Soviet Union and the United States should mobilize their forces "to use these forces to develop cooperation and seek solutions to various disputes." ⑥ Where is this opposition to U.S. imperialism? Aren't these all confessions of the new Soviet leadership adhering to Soviet-U.S. cooperation?
    The new Soviet leadership pretends to say that "the aggressive nature of imperialism has not changed." People can see what they are trying to prove in the books they publish. Like Khrushchev, they describe the people in power in the American ruling group as "wise" people, saying that these people are "willing to peacefully coexist," "recognize the reality of the 'nuclear century,'" and understand that "only suicides can use war as an instrument of their policy." Isn't this equivalent to saying that the representatives of U.S. imperialism do not pursue a policy of aggression and war, and that U.S. imperialism is no longer the main force of aggression and war? Aren't these arguments blatantly promoting that the nature of imperialism has changed?
    Although there are different interest groups within the American monopoly bourgeoisie, and although there are fierce conflicts of interest between these groups, they are completely consistent in their fundamental interests of enslaving the people at home and abroad, and they are all reactionaries. Although the American ruling group has different opinions on counter-revolutionary methods and often quarrels, with one saying that this counter-revolutionary method is good and the other saying that that counter-revolutionary method is good, they are completely consistent in their fundamental policy of maintaining reactionary rule at home and aggression against all countries in the world. There is absolutely no such thing as "wisdom" that transcends class. If the representatives of the American monopoly bourgeoisie have any "wisdom," it is only the "wisdom" to maintain the fundamental interests of the American monopoly bourgeoisie, the "wisdom" to oppress the people of their own country internally and plunder the people of the world externally, and the "wisdom" to pursue a policy of aggression and war. The new Soviet leadership is keen to divide the "wise faction" and the "reactionary faction" in the American ruling group. What other explanation can there be for their actual intention other than to cover up for U.S. imperialism and help the U.S. imperialists paralyze the people of the world?
    The new Soviet leadership sometimes also scolds Johnson a few times. This is just a smokescreen. These books show that, like Khrushchev, they regard the American president as an angel of peace and the absolute representative of the American people. The reason why they do this is also very simple. This is because Khrushchev's revisionists always place their bets on the heads of U.S. imperialism. No matter who becomes the American president, they will do their best to beautify them.
    Facts have slapped Khrushchev's revisionists in the face again and again. Which of the contemporary American presidents is not a tool of the American monopoly bourgeoisie? Johnson himself does not hide this. He said to the American monopolists at the 1964 annual meeting of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, "You are all shareholders of this government," and "I am doing the work you hired me to do." From Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy to Johnson, their aggressive policy and war policy of dominating the world are inherited in one continuous line, and they are becoming more and more developed and more and more crazy. "Johnsonism" is contemporary fascism. It nakedly declares that it will use force to interfere in everything in the world and overthrow all governments in the world that the United States does not like. The Johnson government is gradually escalating on the road of war adventure. "Johnsonism" is a more militant and adventurous manifestation of U.S. imperialism. The new Soviet leadership's reckless whitewashing of the heads of U.S. imperialism can only make themselves look ugly.
    The new Soviet leadership says that they are "恪守列宁遗训" (Ke Shou Liening Yihun, faithfully abiding by Lenin's instructions). How do they treat Lenin? In these books, they even describe Lenin as the founder of the Soviet-U.S. "comprehensive cooperation" policy and portray the history of Soviet-U.S. relations as a history of implementing "comprehensive cooperation." What is this if not betrayal of Lenin and distortion of history?
    After the victory of the October Revolution, U.S. imperialism actively participated in the imperialist crusade of armed intervention against the newborn Soviet state. After the failure of the armed intervention, U.S. imperialism continued to use the "rope of hunger" in an attempt to obstruct the development of the Soviet Union. During the period of Lenin and Stalin's leadership, Soviet-U.S. relations were full of sharp and complex struggles, which was a manifestation of the fierce struggle between the international proletariat and the international bourgeoisie on a global scale. The new Soviet leadership wants to erase the content of class struggle in the history of Soviet-U.S. relations. This is tampering with history, this is insulting the Soviet people.
    Lenin pointed out during his lifetime that U.S. imperialism was the "executioner and gendarme who eradicated Russian freedom," ⑦ playing the "role of strangler and executioner of the world revolution." ⑧ Lenin called on people to "uncompromisingly oppose U.S. imperialism, the newest and strongest imperialism that has finally joined the capitalist world massacre for the division of profits." ⑨ These words of Lenin still sound so fresh to us today! Khrushchev's revisionists hold up Lenin's banner to cover themselves, but Lenin's words most powerfully expose their faces.
    The new Soviet leadership says that they are loyal to the 1957 Declaration and the 1960 Statement. But these books show that they are lying. The Declaration and Statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people all over the world, but these books talk a lot about their Soviet-U.S. friendship. The Declaration and Statement pointed out that the people all over the world must form the broadest united front against the aggressive policy and war policy of U.S. imperialism, but these books vigorously advocate Soviet-U.S. cooperation. What they are loyal to is still the Khrushchev revisionist general line of so-called "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful competition," and "peaceful transition." Their lifting up the 1957 Declaration and the 1960 Statement is nothing more than adopting the old trick of the Second International revisionists, nominally acknowledging it, but actually castrating its revolutionary principles and using beautiful words to cover up their counter-revolutionary essence.
    The new Soviet leadership says that they recognize the role of the people of all countries in the anti-imperialist struggle. But in these books, they unreservedly promote power politics, vividly showing the arrogance of great-power chauvinism. In their eyes, the fate of the world is to be decided by the rulers of the Soviet Union and the United States, more than one hundred countries around the world should revolve around the Soviet-U.S. axis, and the survival of the people all over the world can only rely on the grace of the ruling groups of the Soviet Union and the United States. Doesn't this prove that what Khrushchev's revisionists dream of is Soviet-U.S. cooperation dominating the world?
    The new Soviet leadership hypocritically says that socialist countries and the revolutionary people of all countries have "common goals" and "common interests," and repeatedly professes that they are loyal to proletarian internationalism and support the revolutions of the people of all countries. However, what they are vigorously promoting in these books is the "common interests" of the Soviet Union and the United States. These two kinds of "common interests" are diametrically opposed and incompatible. How can they be brought together? U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of socialist countries and the people of all countries. The fact that Khrushchev's revisionists are bent on talking about "common interests" with U.S. imperialists can only show that they have put their buttocks on the side of U.S. imperialism and that they have placed themselves in a position opposed to socialist countries and the people of all countries who oppose U.S. imperialism.
    Logically speaking, there are irreconcilable contradictions between the socialist Soviet Union and the imperialist United States. As a socialist country, the Soviet Union must support the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, and it is bound to engage in sharp struggles with U.S. imperialism on a global scale and in any local area. Now, the new Soviet leadership emphasizes that there are "no mutual conflicts, whether on a global scale or in any local area" between them and U.S. imperialism. This can only show that in their minds, the contradiction between revolution and counter-revolution on a global scale no longer exists, and the obligation to support the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and oppressed nations no longer exists. They have degenerated into the quagmire of bourgeois national egoism and no longer have a trace of the smell of proletarian internationalism.
    The new Soviet leadership's emphasis on the "common interests" of the Soviet Union and the United States is entirely adapted to the needs of U.S. imperialism. Kennedy had long wanted the Soviet leadership to "only take care of its own national interests" and reach an agreement with the United States "that can guarantee the interests of our two major countries." ⑩ From Khrushchev to the new Soviet leadership, they have actively responded to the call of U.S. imperialism. They do have common interests with U.S. imperialists. This is the common interest of the Soviet bourgeois privileged stratum they represent and the American monopoly capital group, and this is the common interest of the Soviet Union and the United States joining hands to oppose the world revolution.
    The policy ideas of Soviet-U.S. cooperation expounded by the new Soviet leadership in these books have long been put into action. Recently, in order to pursue "common interests" with the United States, they have greatly intensified their collusion with U.S. imperialism.
    The Soviet Union, the United States, and India met in New Delhi, openly strengthening the anti-China united front. U.S. Vice President Humphrey did not conceal his satisfaction after holding a long talk with Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Kosygin. In a television speech, Humphrey said that the talks were "frank and outspoken," that he explained the position of the U.S. government in the talks, and that he "also received a response from Mr. Kosygin." Humphrey said that "the Soviet Union is trying to build a wall of containment around Communist China," and that "the Soviet government today is more concerned about its relationship with Communist China around the world than about anything the United States might do anywhere in the world." Humphrey believes that "looking ahead to the next few years," the United States' "contact will expand, and relations can and should improve" with the Soviet Union.
    Humphrey's remarks show how close the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States has reached. Humphrey is so confident in the policies of the new Soviet leadership and dares to speak so openly because they have exchanged their bottom lines with each other. The policy of the new Soviet leadership is to unite with U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries to establish a counter-revolutionary encirclement against China. This policy of the new Soviet leadership completely conforms to the wishes of U.S. imperialism. The U.S. imperialists will naturally clap their hands and welcome it, support it, and encourage it. This is the essence of the Soviet-U.S. New Delhi meeting. This is the most prominent act of betrayal by the new Soviet leadership. If things were not like this, why didn't the new Soviet leadership refute Humphrey's remarks?
    On the Vietnam issue, Soviet-U.S. collusion has also made further progress. Just as the United States "stopped bombing" and set off a wave of "peace talks," Shelepin hurriedly visited Hanoi, closely coordinating with the American "peace talks" conspiracy. The new Soviet leadership also reached a tacit understanding with the United States on the issue of the European situation, enabling the United States to transfer more and more troops from Europe to Vietnam to expand the war. The new Soviet leadership's current talk of supporting Vietnam and giving Vietnam some assistance is nothing more than an attempt to increase its say on the Vietnam issue, to provoke China-Vietnam relations, and to help the United States realize its "peace talks" conspiracy. In the final analysis, they want to find a way out for U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue, let U.S. imperialism permanently occupy South Vietnam, and make a political deal with U.S. imperialism.
    The U.S. imperialists are very clear about this position of the new Soviet leadership. U.S. Presidential Special Assistant McGeorge Bundy said, "For a long time, we have been very clear: the Soviet government hopes to achieve a peaceful solution." ? An American newspaper said, "There are increasing signs that the Soviet Union and the United States are in fact moving on parallel tracks towards some goal they hold in common." ? An American newspaper also said that if the Soviet Union "ultimately helps to achieve a Vietnam solution that can be accepted by people," the United States will be able to "extricate itself from a critical situation." "In this complex situation, the fundamental point of current Soviet-U.S. relations is that this relationship must be a tacit relationship," "The contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union must continue to be open, while the agreement between them must continue to be unstated," "They are both open enemies and secret allies at the same time." ?
    The new Soviet leadership's Soviet-U.S. cooperation line has, for a period of time, also expanded to Soviet-Japanese cooperation. U.S. imperialism is stepping up its support for Japanese militarism as its main war accomplice in Asia, instructing the Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppet group to sign the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," actually piecing together a Northeast Asian military alliance. For such a serious war deployment by U.S. imperialism targeting China, Korea, and other Asian countries, the new Soviet leadership not only does not condemn it, but also pays great attention to the Japanese reactionaries and intensifies its efforts to win them over. High-level Soviet and Japanese officials frequently make mutual visits. The Japanese Foreign Minister was recently invited to visit the Soviet Union. The new Soviet leadership actually recognizes the U.S.-Japan military alliance and wants to get a share of it to create a Soviet-U.S.-Japan alliance to oppose the revolutions of China, Korea, and the people of Asian countries.
    After all these things have happened, the new Soviet leadership still says that communist parties and socialist countries of all countries should put aside their differences and carry out "joint actions" in the anti-imperialist struggle. How can this convince people? Who are they uniting with and who are they opposing? Isn't it clear?
    The new Soviet leadership is taking joint action with U.S. imperialists, joint action with Japanese reactionaries, joint action with Indian reactionaries, and joint action with all the lackeys of U.S. imperialism. Since they are so keen on counter-revolutionary joint actions, how can Marxists-Leninists and revolutionary people take joint action with them? In today's world, the biggest and most fundamental difference between Marxists-Leninists and Khrushchev's revisionists, between true revolutionaries and fake revolutionaries, is the difference between opposing or uniting with U.S. imperialism. How can such a major difference be put aside?
    As long as the new Soviet leadership does not abandon Khrushchev's revisionist line, does not change the Soviet-U.S. cooperation line, and does not cancel the Soviet-U.S.-India-Japan alliance, we will never engage in any joint action with them.
    Khrushchev's revisionists have tied their fate to U.S. imperialism. Marxists-Leninists and revolutionary people must oppose Khrushchev's revisionism in order to oppose U.S. imperialism. Only by resolutely drawing a clear line between ourselves and Khrushchev's revisionists, only by carrying the struggle against Khrushchev's revisionism to the end, can we smoothly carry out the struggle against U.S. imperialism.
    Khrushchev's revisionists spread pro-American ideas, and we must establish the idea of ​​despising U.S. imperialism and recognizing the decadent essence of U.S. imperialism. Khrushchev's revisionists spread flattering-American ideas, and we must establish the idea of ​​hating U.S. imperialism and recognizing that it is the number one enemy of the people all over the world. Khrushchev's revisionists spread fear-American ideas, and we must establish the idea of ​​despising U.S. imperialism and treating it as a paper tiger in truth. Khrushchev's revisionists spread the idea of ​​uniting with the United States, and we must establish the idea of ​​overthrowing U.S. imperialism and consolidate and expand the broadest united front against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.
    On the issue of how to understand and treat U.S. imperialism, a series of viewpoints put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong have creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and have become a powerful weapon for the people of the world to carry out the anti-American revolutionary struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong called on us to rely on the workers and peasants, unite the masses of people who account for more than 90% of the world's population, and all the forces that have been subjected to American aggression, control, interference, and bullying, to form the broadest united front to isolate and strike at the most important enemy at present, U.S. imperialism. All forces that can be united must be united, all contradictions that can be used must be used, and all positive factors that are conducive to the anti-American struggle must be mobilized. This great strategic thought of Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the correct path to defeat U.S. imperialism. Its correctness has been proven by the entire process of international class struggle in the post-war period. This strategic thought not only armed the Chinese people, but also has a far-reaching influence in the world. It is what U.S. imperialism fears the most, what Khrushchev's revisionists are most troubled by, and what the people all over the world welcome the most.
    Soviet-U.S. cooperation dominating the world is just a presumptuous dream. The real masters of the world are the people of all countries. The ruling groups of any country, whether they are imperialists or revisionists, will never be able to ride on the heads of the people of all countries and rule the world.
    On a global scale, a new and great anti-American revolutionary storm will soon come. The anti-people policy of Khrushchev's revisionists can only start with the purpose of harming others and end with the result of harming themselves. Those who oppose the people will inevitably be overthrown by the people, and those who violate the historical trend will inevitably be buried by the historical trend. No matter what kind of struggles and twists and turns we have to go through, the world has only one future, that is, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices will surely perish, and the revolutionary cause of the people all over the world will surely win.

    苏共新领导奉行苏美合作路线的供状
    《红旗》杂志评论员
    苏美合作主宰世界，是赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线的灵魂。苏共新领导上台以后，极力显示他们与赫鲁晓夫有所不同，装起一副反美的样子，企图掩盖他们继续推行这条路线的实质。然而，越来越多的事实表明，他们在苏美合作方面，比赫鲁晓夫做得更加彻底，走得更远了。
    苏共新领导对于马克思列宁主义者揭露他们的真面目，感到很恼火。他们破口大骂，说我们揭露他们的文章充满着“毫无根据的诽谤性和挑衅性的捏造”①。
    咒骂和诡辩是改变不了事实的。苏共新领导的大量言论和实际行动，他们的报刊文章，每天都在揭露他们自己。苏共新领导在一九六五年出版的一批宣扬苏美合作的书籍，也是一个明显的例证。在这一批书中，《美国对外政策的动力》和《苏联和美国——它们的政治关系和经济关系》，是具有代表性的两本。
    这两本书的主要论点是些什么呢？
    《美国对外政策的动力》一书，是一九六五年由苏联科学院世界经济和国际关系研究所编辑出版的。这本书虽然不能不谈到美国对外侵略的某些事实，说了一些指责美国侵略活动的话，但是它力图证明，这些坏事都是美国垄断资产阶级的反动派干的，而同样代表垄断资产阶级的美帝国主义头子却不属于反动派之列，这就是说，美帝国主义的侵略本性是可以改变的。谴责美帝国主义，不过是表面文章，掩盖美帝国主义的侵略本性，才是全书的实质。
    这本书把美国统治集团分为“冷静的、明智的”和“好战的、侵略的”两个派别。书中说，“对外政策和军事政策中冒险主义的和侵略的趋势同冷静的和明智的趋势这两者之间的斗争，正日益强烈地席卷着美国的真正统治者队伍——国内最大垄断组织”。书中还说，“美国社会生活中两种对外政策趋向，即两个集团——极端反动的疯狂侵略派和倾向于明智地估计现有力量对比、倾向于和平共处的温和冷静派之间的斗争已达极点。”
    谁是这种“倾向于和平共处的温和冷静派”呢？照这本书的说法，就是美帝国主义的头子，战后历届美国总统。书中说，艾森豪威尔“代表比较温和的、无意实行自己的冒险主张和冒大战危险的人士”；肯尼迪是“受人民欢迎的”总统，“眼界宽阔，冷静地对待国际生活的迫切问题”，“了解和平共处的可能性和必要性”；约翰逊是个“非常慎重而温和的政治家”，“不倾向于政治冒险”，他“得到人民的绝对委任，去实现旨在巩固和平、消除‘冷战’、谋求苏美接近的政策”。
    这些战争罪魁怎么会忽然变成了和平人士呢？这些人民公敌怎么会忽然变成了受人民欢迎的总统呢？书中这样为美帝国主义的头子涂脂抹粉，无非是为了推销苏美“和平共处”、“和平竞赛”的货色。书中说，“美国统治阶级或多或少地开始理解到，当前世界阶级力量的具有决定性的斗争场所是和平经济竞赛”。在“核世纪”，“只有疯人，只有自杀者，才能把战争作为自己政策的工具”，“美国政府在许多情况下都表示出了妥协的意愿”。书中说，只要苏美“和平共处”，“那么国际舞台上两种社会经济体系的竞赛和两个主要敌手的意识形态斗争，就将限定在没有流血冲突与战争的、广泛的经济、外交、科学和文化的竞赛与合作的范围之内”。
    这本书宣称，“苏美关系，世界两大最强国家的关系，是世界政治的轴心，是国际和平的主要基础”。书中引用美国国务卿腊斯克的话，鼓吹“两大国——苏联和美国——对世界命运，对人类命运的特殊责任”。书中说，苏联“致力于同美国的和平与合作，认为苏美关系是当代世界政治中的首要问题，是战争与和平问题的关键”。
    那么，美帝国主义侵略越南，轰炸社会主义的越南民主共和国，屠杀越南人民，会不会妨碍苏美关系呢？照这本书的说法，是不会的，即使在这种情况下，苏美之间也没有任何冲突。这本书强调“苏美关系非常重要的特点”，是所谓“两国民族利益的共同性”。书中说，“除开一九一八年到一九二○年美国参加对苏俄的军事干涉这个污点之外，俄美和苏美关系没有为任何军事冲突和战争的乌云所笼罩。”“就是在现在，两国之间并不存在任何领土的、经济的争执和冲突，它们的民族利益，无论是在全世界范围内，或者在任何局部地区的范围内，都没有互相冲突”。
    《苏联和美国——它们的政治关系和经济关系》一书，是一九六五年由苏联科学院世界经济和国际关系研究所批准出版的。这本书论述了从十月革命到第二次世界大战期间的苏美关系史。它不能不提到美国侵略和敌视苏联的历史事实，但是，它的落脚点仍然是苏美合作，它强调“苏联旨在同美国建立全面合作的政策是不变的”。
    为了替苏共新领导的苏美“全面合作”政策辩护，这本书不惜歪曲历史，硬说“苏维埃国家从其成立最初之日起就始终一贯地奉行同美国全面合作的方针”，“一九一七至一九四一年苏美关系的历史令人信服地表明，苏联和美国之间的和平共处、友好合作，既符合苏联和美国人民的利益，也符合其他各国人民的利益”。书中还说，“第二次世界大战年代的苏美合作，为永远结束美国统治集团战前的不现实的和缺乏远见的对苏政策，为发展战后时期卓有成效的苏美关系，创造了有利的条件”。
    为了给苏美合作的政策制造根据，这本书极力渲染当今的美国统治集团是爱好和平的。书中说，现在“美国有势力集团中比较有远见和头脑清醒的代表人物，都主张实行比较现实的对外政策”，“他们清楚地理解到，在现时的国际局势中，美国和苏联之间唯一可以接受的合作基础是和平共处及在经济、科学技术、文化和其他方面进行竞赛”。
    这本书强调，“苏联共产党和苏联政府过去和现在一贯认为苏美关系的正常化具有头等重要的意义”。书中搬出了苏共第二十一次代表大会对赫鲁晓夫报告的决议中的这一论点：“改善苏联和美国的关系，对于促进国际局势的健康发展，会起决定性的作用，因为苏联和美国是两个对普遍和平的命运负有特殊责任的国家。”
    人们可以清楚地看到，这两本书的腔调，同赫鲁晓夫的言论是一模一样的。赫鲁晓夫说过，“整个国际局势在很大程度上都取决于美国和苏联之间建立什么样的关系”②，“历史把对世界命运的巨大责任加于我们两国人民身上”③，苏美两国的“利益在任何地方都不发生直接冲突，无论在领土问题上还是在经济方面”，“我们完全可以共处”④。赫鲁晓夫的徒子徒孙，不过是照着葫芦画瓢而已。
    很显然，这些书，完全是根据苏共第二十次、第二十一次、第二十二次代表大会和苏共纲领的修正主义路线写成的。书中的话，就是苏共新领导所要说的话。这些书的出版，又一次证明了苏共新领导奉行着没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫主义，证明了他们的苏美合作的思想，不是偶然的，而是一贯的，他们追求苏美合作，不是个别的言行，而是根本的路线。这些书，就是苏共新领导奉行苏美合作路线的供状。
    乍看起来，这两本书用了不少篇幅叙述美帝国主义的侵略活动，骂了美国的反动派。但是，只要仔细看一看，就不难发现，书中只是泛泛地谴责美帝国主义，而对美国统治集团的当权派，却极尽其吹捧之能事。尽管书中表示苏联反对美国的侵略活动，然而说来说去，总是乞求苏美合作。这种小骂大帮忙的手法，无非是为了欺骗苏联人民和世界人民，为美帝国主义更好地效劳而已。
    这两本书引起了人们的注意。它们是很好的反面教材。它们揭穿了苏共新领导现在玩弄的种种欺骗手腕。
    苏共新领导说，他们是反对美帝国主义的。事实怎么样呢？正是在美帝国主义疯狂扩大侵略越南战争的一九六五年，他们出版了这样一批宣扬苏美合作的书，宣称“苏联旨在同美国建立全面合作的政策是不变的”。苏共领导人自己也多次出马，亲口说明了这一点。苏共中央第一书记勃列日涅夫在一九六五年五月说，“我们主张发展和改善同美国的关系”⑤。苏联部长会议主席柯西金一九六五年十二月在同《纽约时报》记者赖斯顿的谈话中说，苏美两国“从长远前景的观点来看，主要的应该是，组织一切力量来抵制战争”，苏美两国应该动员自己的力量，“把这些力量用于发展合作和寻求各种争端的解决办法”。⑥这那里是什么反对美帝国主义呢？这些话难道不都是苏共新领导坚持苏美合作的自供吗？
    苏共新领导装模作样地说，“帝国主义的侵略本性没有改变”。人们可以看看，他们在自己出版的书中究竟是想证明什么。他们同赫鲁晓夫一样，把美国统治集团的当权派说成是“明智派”，说这些人“愿意和平共处”，“认识‘核世纪’的现实性”，懂得“只有自杀者，才能把战争作为自己政策的工具”。这岂不是等于说，美帝国主义的代表人物并不是奉行侵略政策和战争政策的，美帝国主义不再是侵略和战争的主要力量了吗？这些论点不是明目张胆地宣传帝国主义的本性已经改变了吗？
    美国垄断资产阶级内部尽管有不同的利益集团，这些集团之间尽管有剧烈的利害冲突，他们在奴役国内外人民的根本利益上是完全一致的，他们统统都是反动派。美国统治集团在反革命的方法上虽然有不同的主张，经常吵吵嚷嚷，这个说这种反革命方法好，那个说那种反革命方法好，但是，他们在维护国内反动统治和侵略世界各国的根本政策上，是完全一致的。世界上绝没有什么超阶级的“明智”。如果说美国垄断资产阶级代表人物有什么“明智”的话，那不过是维护美国垄断资产阶级根本利益的“明智”，对内压迫本国人民、对外掠夺世界人民的“明智”，推行侵略政策和战争政策的“明智”罢了。苏共新领导热中于在美国统治集团中划分什么“明智派”和“反动派”，他们的实际用意，除了替美帝国主义打掩护，帮助美帝国主义者麻痹世界人民，又能有什么别的解释呢？
    苏共新领导有时也骂几句约翰逊。这不过是一种烟幕。这些书表明，他们同赫鲁晓夫一样，把美国总统说成是和平的天使，美国人民的绝对代表。他们这样做，道理也很简单。这是因为，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者总是把他们的赌注压在美帝国主义头子的身上，不论谁当了美国总统，他们都要极力地加以美化。
    事实一次又一次地打了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的耳光。当代美国的总统，那一个不是美国垄断资产阶级的工具呢？约翰逊自己并不掩饰这一点。他在美国商会一九六四年年会上对美国垄断资本家说，“你们都是本政府的股东”，“我在进行你们雇用我来做的工作”。从杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪到约翰逊，他们独霸世界的侵略政策和战争政策是一脉相承的，而且越来越发展，越来越疯狂。“约翰逊主义”就是当代的法西斯主义。它赤裸裸地宣布，要使用武力来干涉世界上一切地方的事情，推翻世界上一切美国所不喜欢的政府。约翰逊政府正在战争冒险的道路上逐步升级。“约翰逊主义”是美帝国主义更加好战、更加冒险的表现。苏共新领导不顾一切地给美帝国主义头子脸上贴金，只能给他们自己出丑。
    苏共新领导说，他们是“恪守列宁遗训”的。他们究竟是怎样对待列宁的呢？他们在这些书中，竟然把列宁说成是苏美“全面合作”政策的创始人，把苏美关系的历史描绘成一部实行“全面合作”的历史。这不是对列宁的背叛，对历史的歪曲，又是什么呢？
    十月革命胜利以后，美帝国主义积极参加了武装干涉新生苏维埃国家的帝国主义十字军。在武装干涉失败以后，美帝国主义继续用“饥饿的绳索”，企图阻挡苏联的发展。在列宁和斯大林领导的时期，苏美关系充满着尖锐的复杂的斗争，这是国际无产阶级同国际资产阶级在世界范围内剧烈斗争的表现。苏共新领导要在苏美关系的历史中抹去阶级斗争的内容，这是篡改历史，这是污辱苏联人民。
    列宁在世的时候就指出，美帝国主义是“消灭俄国自由的刽子手和宪兵”⑦，扮演了“世界革命的绞杀者和刽子手的角色”⑧。列宁号召，“要毫不调和地反对美帝国主义，反对这个最后参加资本家为瓜分利润而进行的世界大屠杀的最新最强的帝国主义”⑨。列宁的这些话，今天我们读起来，还是那么清新！赫鲁晓夫修正主义者打出列宁的旗帜来掩护自己，但是，列宁的话恰恰最有力地揭穿了他们的面目。
    苏共新领导说，他们是忠实于一九五七年宣言和一九六○年声明的。但是这些书表明，他们是在说谎。宣言和声明指出，美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人，而这些书却大谈其苏美友谊。宣言和声明指出，全世界人民必须结成最广泛的统一战线，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，而这些书却极力鼓吹苏美合作。他们所忠实的，还是所谓“和平共处”、“和平竞赛”、“和平过渡”的赫鲁晓夫修正主义总路线。他们抬出一九五七年宣言和一九六○年声明来，不过是采取了第二国际修正主义者的老手法，表面上承认它，实际上阉割它的革命原则，用漂亮的词句来掩盖他们反对革命的本质。
    苏共新领导说，他们是承认各国人民在反帝斗争中的作用的。但是在这些书里，他们毫不掩饰地宣扬强权政治，活现出一副大国沙文主义的神气。在他们眼里，世界的命运是要由苏美两国的统治者来决定的，全世界一百多个国家都应当围绕着苏美轴心打转，全世界人民的生存都只能仰赖于苏美两国统治集团的恩赐。这难道不是证明，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者梦寐以求的，就是苏美合作主宰世界吗？
    苏共新领导假惺惺地说，社会主义国家和各国革命人民有着“共同的目标”、“共同的利益”，并且一再表白他们是忠实于无产阶级国际主义，支持各国人民革命的。但是，他们在这些书中大事宣传的，却是苏美两国的“共同利益”。这样两种“共同利益”，是截然相反的，是水火不相容的，怎么能够扯到一块呢？美帝国主义是社会主义国家和各国人民的公敌。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者一心要跟美帝国主义者讲什么“共同利益”，这只能说明他们把屁股坐到美帝国主义那一边去了，他们把自己置于同反对美帝国主义的社会主义国家和各国人民相对立的地位。
    按道理说，社会主义的苏联同帝国主义的美国之间，存在着不可调和的矛盾。苏联作为一个社会主义国家，要支持被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争，就必然在全世界范围内，在任何局部地区的范围内，同美帝国主义发生尖锐的斗争。现在，苏共新领导却强调，他们同美帝国主义之间，“无论是在全世界范围内，或者在任何局部地区的范围内，都没有互相冲突”。这只能表明，在他们的心目中，世界范围内革命与反革命的矛盾早就不存在了，支持被压迫人民和被压迫民族革命斗争的义务早就不存在了。他们已经堕落到资产阶级民族利己主义的泥坑里，再没有一丝一毫的无产阶级国际主义气味了。
    苏共新领导强调苏美两国的“共同利益”，这完全是适应美帝国主义的需要。肯尼迪早就要苏共领导“只照管它的本国利益”，同美国“达成能保障我们两大国的利益”的协议⑩。从赫鲁晓夫到苏共新领导，都积极地响应美帝国主义的号召。他们的确同美帝国主义者有着共同利益，这就是他们所代表的苏联资产阶级特权阶层和美国垄断资本集团的共同利益，这就是苏美合伙反对世界革命的共同利益。
    苏共新领导在这些书里所阐述的苏美合作的政策思想，早已付诸行动。最近一个时期，他们为了追求同美国的“共同利益”，大大加紧了同美帝国主义的勾结。
    苏美印三家在新德里会见，公开加强反华联合阵线。美国副总统汉弗莱在同苏联部长会议主席柯西金进行了长时间的会谈以后，毫不掩饰他的满意心情。汉弗莱在电视讲话中说，这次会谈是“坦率的、直言不讳的”，他在会谈中说明了美国政府的立场，并且“也从柯西金先生那里得到了响应”。汉弗莱说，“苏联正试图在共产党中国周围建立一道遏制的墙”，“苏联政府今天对于自己在全世界各地与共产党中国之间的关系的关切，比对于美国在世界上任何地方可能做的任何事情更关切得多”。汉弗莱认为，“展望今后几年”，美国同苏联的“接触将会扩大，关系能够改善而且应该改善”。?
    汉弗莱的谈话表明，苏美之间的合作达到了何等亲密的程度。汉弗莱对于苏共新领导的政策这样有把握，敢于公开这样讲，是因为他们互相交了底。苏共新领导的政策，就是要联合美帝国主义和各国反动派，建立一个反对中国的反革命包围圈。苏共新领导的这种政策，完全符合美帝国主义的心意。美帝国主义者很自然地要拍手欢迎，加以支持和鼓励。这就是苏美新德里会谈的实质。这是苏共新领导最突出的叛变行动。如果事情不是这样，苏共新领导为什么没有对汉弗莱的讲话辟谣呢？
    在越南问题上，苏美勾结也有了进一步的发展。正当美国“停止轰炸”，掀起一阵“和谈”喧嚣的时候，谢列平仆仆风尘访问河内，紧密配合美国的“和谈”阴谋。苏共新领导还同美国在欧洲局势问题上达成了默契，使美国能够从欧洲抽调越来越多的兵力到越南来扩大战争。苏共新领导现在讲一些支持越南的话，给越南一些援助，无非是企图在越南问题上增加自己的发言权，企图挑拨中越关系，企图帮助美国实现“和谈”阴谋。归根到底，他们是要在越南问题上为美帝国主义找出路，让美帝国主义永远霸占越南南方，同美帝国主义做成一笔政治交易。
    苏共新领导这种立场，美帝国主义者很清楚。美国总统特别助理麦·邦迪说，“长期以来，我们一直很清楚：苏联政府希望能够取得和平解决”?。美国报纸说，“有越来越多的迹象表明，苏联和美国事实上是在并行的轨道上向着它们共同持有的某种目标前进”?。美国报纸还说，如果苏联“最终将帮助取得一种可以为人们所接受的越南解决办法的话”，美国将可以“从一种危急的局面中脱出身来”。“在这种复杂的局面下，目前苏美关系的根本之点在于，这种关系必须是一种默契的关系”，“美苏之间的矛盾必须继续是公开的，它们之间的一致却必须继续是不讲明的”，“它们既是公开的敌人而同时又是暗中的盟友”。?
    苏共新领导的苏美合作路线，一个时期以来又扩展到了苏日合作方面。美帝国主义加紧扶植日本军国主义，作为自己在亚洲的主要战争帮凶，指使日本反动派和南朝鲜傀儡集团签订了“日韩条约”，实际上拼凑了东北亚军事同盟。对于美帝国主义这样一种针对中国、朝鲜和其他亚洲国家的严重战争部署，苏共新领导不但不予谴责，反而向日本反动派大献殷勤，加紧拉拢。苏日高级官员频繁地进行相互访问。日本外务相最近应邀访问了苏联。苏共新领导实际上承认了日美军事联盟，并且要搭上自己的一股，搞一个苏美日联盟，来反对中国、朝鲜和亚洲各国人民的革命斗争。
    在发生了所有这样一些事情以后，苏共新领导还说，各国共产党和社会主义国家要把它们之间的分歧放在一边，在反帝斗争中实行“联合行动”，这怎么能够取信于人呢？他们究竟是联合谁，反对谁，难道还不清楚吗？
    苏共新领导是同美帝国主义者联合行动，是同日本反动派联合行动，是同印度反动派联合行动，是同美帝国主义的一切走狗联合行动。既然他们这样热中于反革命的联合行动，马克思列宁主义者和革命人民怎么能够同他们联合行动呢？在当今世界上，马克思列宁主义者同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者之间，真革命派同假革命派之间，最大的根本分歧，就是反对还是联合美帝国主义的分歧。这样重大的分歧怎么能够放在一边呢？
    只要苏共新领导不放弃赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线，不改变苏美合作路线，不取消苏美印日联盟，我们就决不能同他们搞什么联合行动。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者已经把自己的命运同美帝国主义拴在一起。马克思列宁主义者和革命人民要反对美帝国主义，就势必要反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义。只有坚决同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者划清界限，只有把反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的斗争进行到底，才能顺利地进行反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者散布崇美思想，我们就必须树立蔑视美帝国主义的思想，认清美帝国主义的腐朽本质。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者散布媚美思想，我们就必须树立仇视美帝国主义的思想，认清它是全世界人民的头号敌人。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者散布恐美思想，我们就必须树立藐视美帝国主义的思想，如实地把它当做一只纸老虎。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者散布联美思想，我们就必须树立打倒美帝国主义的思想，巩固和扩大反对美帝国主义及其走狗的最广泛的统一战线。
    在怎样认识和对待美帝国主义的问题上，毛泽东同志提出的一系列观点，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，成为世界人民进行反美革命斗争的强大武器。毛泽东同志号召，依靠工人、农民，团结占世界人口百分之九十以上的人民群众，以及所有受到美国侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的力量，结成最广泛的统一战线，最大限度地孤立和打击当前最主要的敌人美帝国主义。一切可以团结的力量都要团结，一切可以利用的矛盾都要利用，一切有利于反美斗争的积极因素都要调动起来。毛泽东同志这个伟大的战略思想，指出了打败美帝国主义的正确道路。它的正确性已经为战后时期国际阶级斗争的整个进程所证明。这个战略思想，不但武装了中国人民，而且在世界范围内越来越发挥着深远的影响。它是美帝国主义最害怕的，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者最头痛的，全世界人民最欢迎的。
    苏美合作主宰世界，只是一种狂妄的梦想。世界的真正主人是各国人民。任何国家的统治集团，无论是帝国主义者，还是修正主义者，要想骑在各国人民的头上，统治全世界，那是绝对办不到的。
    在世界范围内，一个新的、伟大的反美革命风暴不久就将来临。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的反人民的政策，只能是以损人的目的开始，以害己的结果告终。反对人民的人必定被人民所打倒，违背历史潮流的人必定被历史潮流所埋葬。无论要经历什么样的斗争和曲折，世界只有一个前途，那就是美帝国主义及其帮凶一定要灭亡，全世界人民的革命事业一定会胜利。
