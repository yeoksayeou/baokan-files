　　Protesting American Aggressors' Recruitment of Cannon Fodder in the Philippines for Aggression Against Vietnam
    Filipino People Rise Up in Demonstration
    Xinhua News Agency, Manila, 20th—According to a report by the *Manila Chronicle* on the 20th, thousands of workers and citizens in Angeles City, Philippines, held a four-hour anti-American demonstration on the morning of the 19th, protesting the United States' recruitment of Filipinos to serve as cannon fodder for the American war of aggression against Vietnam, and protesting the United States' use of Clark Air Base to carry out its war of aggression.
    The demonstrating masses, holding up placards, set out from the city center to hold a denunciation rally in front of the gate of the U.S. Clark Air Base. Former Congressman Emilio Cortes said at the meeting, "The Vietnam War was started by the United States, not the Philippines." He pointed out that the United States cannot win this war, and it is of no benefit for the Philippines to send its people to sell their lives for the Americans. He warned that the Philippines sending troops to Vietnam is tantamount to declaring war on Vietnam.
    The demonstrating masses handed over a nine-point declaration to the U.S. base authorities. This declaration detailed the Filipinos' hatred of the Americans.
    According to Manila newspapers, anti-American rallies and demonstrations are now springing up everywhere in the Philippines. In the past nine days, workers, students, youth, and people from all walks of life, including some mayors and local officials, have taken to the streets of Manila and Angeles City three times to hold demonstrations, protesting the United States' demand that the Philippines send troops to South Vietnam, and protesting the Philippine authorities' surrender to U.S. pressure.

　　抗议美国侵略者在菲搜罗侵越炮灰
    菲律宾人民奋起举行示威
    新华社二十日讯　马尼拉消息：据《马尼拉纪事报》二十日报道，菲律宾洪裔礼示市数千名工人和市民，十九日上午举行了长达四小时的反美示威，抗议美国搜罗菲律宾人去为美国侵略越南的战争充当炮灰，抗议美国使用克拉克机场来进行侵略战争。
    示威群众高举着标语牌从市区出发，到美国克拉克空军基地大门前举行声讨大会。前国会议员埃米略·科尔特斯在会上说：“越南战争是美国搞的，不是菲律宾的”。他指出，美国打赢不了这场战争，菲律宾把自己的人派去替美国人卖命是没有好处的。他警告说，菲律宾出兵越南就等于向越南宣战。
    示威群众把一份九点宣言交给了美国基地当局。这份宣言详细地陈述了菲律宾人对美国人的仇恨。
    据马尼拉的报纸报道，现在，菲律宾的反美大会和示威游行正在风起云涌。在最近九天，工人、学生、青年和各阶层人民，包括一些市长和地方官员，已三次走上马尼拉和洪裔礼示的街头举行示威游行，抗议美国要菲律宾派军队去南越，抗议菲律宾当局屈服于美国的压力。（附图片）
