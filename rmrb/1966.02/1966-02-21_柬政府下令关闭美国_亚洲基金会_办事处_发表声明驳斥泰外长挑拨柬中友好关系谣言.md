　　New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 19th -- According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 19th, the Royal Cambodian Government has notified the Phnom Penh office of the American "Asia Foundation" to cease operations from March 1, 1966.
　　Prince Norodom Kantol, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Royal Cambodian Government, recently notified Mr. Harris, acting representative of the "Asia Foundation" in Phnom Penh, of the Royal Cambodian Government's decision on January 25 to close the organization in a letter to him.
　　The "Asia Foundation" office in Phnom Penh is a special agency established by the United States in Cambodia to carry out intelligence and subversive activities. In a telegram to the chairman of this organization on February 5, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk pointed out that "in a serious moment of defending our independence and neutrality, granting spies from American intelligence and subversive agencies complete freedom of action is something we cannot risk."
　　New China News Agency, Phnom Penh, February 19th -- According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 19th, the Royal Cambodian Government issued a statement refuting rumors spread by Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman regarding Cambodia's desire to restore diplomatic relations with Thailand.
　　The statement said that, according to the *Bangkok Post*, Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman "allegedly disclosed that Cambodia had made secret contact with Thailand in order to normalize relations between the two countries." Thai newspapers also "quoted senior Thai officials" as saying that Prince Sihanouk did so because he "realized that leaning his country entirely to the People's China was detrimental to him."
　　The statement said: "The Royal Cambodian Government resolutely refutes this extremely bizarre claim by Thanat Khoman. Since the severance of diplomatic relations between the two countries, Cambodia has not conducted any probing or attempted secret contact with the Bangkok government whatsoever."
　　The statement said: "If Cambodia, together with China, opposes American neo-colonialism, it is because this stance is in line with the aspirations of the peoples of Asian countries for independence; of course, this is not to attach ourselves to China, and China has never had such a demand or hope."
　　The statement reiterated Cambodia's conditions for restoring Cambodian-Thai relations: the Thai government should issue a statement guaranteeing full respect for the borders of the two countries; and the Thai army and its "Free Khmer" mercenaries must immediately cease attacks and aggression against Cambodia.

　　柬政府下令关闭美国“亚洲基金会”办事处
　　发表声明驳斥泰外长挑拨柬中友好关系谣言
    新华社金边十九日电　据柬埔寨新闻社十九日报道，柬埔寨王国政府已经通知美国“亚洲基金会”驻金边的办事处，从一九六六年三月一日起停止活动。
    柬埔寨内阁首相兼外交大臣诺罗敦·康托尔亲王最近在写给“亚洲基金会”驻金边办事处代理代表哈里斯的一封信中，把柬埔寨王国政府一月二十五日作出的关于关闭这个机构的决定，通知了他。
      “亚洲基金会”驻金边办事处是美国设在柬埔寨进行情报和颠覆活动的特务机构。柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二月五日在给这个机构的主席的一份电报中指出，“在捍卫我们的独立和中立的严重时刻，给美国情报和颠覆机构的特务以一切行动自由，这对我们来说，是不能不担风险的。”
  据新华社金边十九日电　据柬埔寨新闻社十九日报道，柬埔寨王国政府发表了一项声明，驳斥泰国外交部长科曼散布的所谓柬埔寨要同泰国恢复外交关系的谣言。
    声明说，据《曼谷邮报》报道，泰国外交部长他纳·科曼“曾经透露，柬埔寨同泰国进行了秘密接触，以便使两国之间的关系正常化”。泰国报纸还“引用泰国高级官员的话”说，西哈努克亲王这样做，是因为他“体会到把自己的国家完全倒向人民中国一边，对他不利”。
    声明说：“柬埔寨王国政府断然驳斥他纳·科曼的这种极其离奇的说法。自从两国断绝外交关系以来，柬埔寨丝毫没有进行过试探或者企图同曼谷政府进行秘密接触。”
    声明说：“如果柬埔寨同中国一起反对美国新殖民主义，这是因为这种立场是符合亚洲各国人民要求独立的愿望的，当然，这不是为了把自己依附于中国，而中国从来没有这样的要求或希望。”
    声明重申柬埔寨关于恢复柬泰关系的条件是：泰国政府应该发表声明，保证完全尊重两国的边界；泰国军队及其“自由高棉”雇佣军必须立即停止对柬埔寨的袭击和侵略。
