    Remembering Ouyang Hai, Learning from Ouyang Hai
   “Ouyang Hai Class” Soldier Ouyang Hu
    I received the novel *The Song of Ouyang Hai*, and I couldn’t wait to finish it in one go. This is not only because the protagonist, Ouyang Hai, is my third elder brother, but more importantly: he is a great communist fighter, my old squad leader, and the path he took is exactly the path our young people need to take.
    In the old society, Ouyang Hai and I were tied to the same bitter vine, suffering the exploitation and oppression of the landlords. Seeing the section where Ouyang Hai led his younger brother to beg for food, although the author did not use many words, every word and sentence felt like a thousand pounds hitting my heart, and I couldn’t suppress my feelings. Tears flowed out, my eyes blurred, and the hardships of my childhood life were immediately revealed.
    Just as the book describes, before liberation, my third brother and I were wrapped in a few hard, tattered rags, begging for food everywhere in the heavy snow. The landlord's vicious dog bit both of us, drawing blood. At that time, I was so scared that I cried loudly, and my third brother hugged me tightly and said, "Don't cry, little brother, don't cry!" I looked up at my third brother, and he really wasn't crying, not a single tear, just staring angrily at the landlord's gate.
    In 1949, liberation came, and the Communist Party and Chairman Mao brought happiness to us poor people. My third brother carried a red-tasseled spear and even became the leader of the children's corps! He stood guard and patrolled in the village, monitoring bad people. At the struggle meetings against landlords, he and the masses shouted slogans together, overthrowing the landlords.
    As the novel's author wrote, he had a clear class stand and a deep-seated hatred for the landlords and class enemies. He treated the poor and lower-middle peasants and the "Five Guarantees" households who lacked labor with utmost care, carrying water for them when they lacked water and delivering firewood when they lacked firewood. One year, because of his good labor, the commune awarded him more than a hundred catties of grain, and he took out eighty catties to distribute to the "Five Guarantees" households. The commune had five mu of sunflower seed fields that needed weeding, and it was set at eighty work points. Some commune members still felt it was a bit low. Ouyang Hai stood up and said, "Eighty work points are not low, I'll take it on." He worked day and night and finished weeding in two days. He only recorded twenty work points in his own work point book. Some well-off middle peasants said he was stupid, but Ouyang Hai replied to them righteously, "For the collective, I am willing to be this 'fool'."
    Ouyang Hai had established the great ambition of becoming a People's Liberation Army soldier since he was a child. He said to his father and mother, "I want to join the People's Liberation Army and be a good person like a soldier." Because he was young and had ruined his health in the past, his physique was very weak, and he failed several physicals. But he was not discouraged.
    In 1959, he finally realized his wish. I remember clearly that on the day he left, there were no clouds in the sky, and the warm sun shone into Phoenix Village and into our home. He was about to leave, everything was ready, when he suddenly remembered something and ran into the house, busily rummaging through boxes and cabinets. He found a tattered wool coat from the bottom of the box and stuffed it into his luggage. I was very puzzled and asked, "Third brother, why are you taking such a tattered wool coat to the army?" He said seriously, "This was divided from the landlord during the land reform. Wearing it will keep me from forgetting the past suffering, from forgetting the hatred for the landlord, and from forgetting the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao."
    I held his hand and saw him out of the village. He repeatedly told me, "Fourth brother! Now I am leaving. I am joining the army to protect the land that we poor people have divided and to protect our happy days. You must work hard at home, listen to your father and mother, and be a good commune member."
    In 1960, the Military Commission and Vice Chairman Lin called on the troops to study Chairman Mao's works, pointing out a direction for Ouyang Hai to become a good soldier of Chairman Mao. He studied Chairman Mao's books diligently. He had only studied for two years at home, and a large part of these two years was spent working with his father. He read little and had a low level of education, so he had difficulty reading Chairman Mao's works at first. This did not stump him. If his cultural level was low, he asked others for advice. If he didn't know a word, he looked it up in the dictionary and wrote the pronunciation next to the new word. I opened the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* that he had studied, and it was covered with circles, lines, and symbols that only he recognized. Festivals and holidays were the best opportunities for him to study Chairman Mao's works. Even a few minutes before going to bed at night or a short break on a business trip, he would open Chairman Mao's works and study a few lines. Chairman Mao's works infinitely enriched Ouyang Hai's spiritual world. He understood: "The proletariat must liberate all mankind in order to liberate itself." He also understood: "The victory of the people's revolution is won by the sacrifice of millions of people. To undertake this sacrifice for victory is the greatest pride and pleasure of our communists."
    What force made Ouyang Hai go from only seeing Phoenix Village to seeing all of China and the world? It is Chairman Mao's works!
    What force turned Ouyang Hai from a beggar into a great communist fighter? It is Chairman Mao's works!
    After reading *The Song of Ouyang Hai*, I further understood that if our younger generation wants to shoulder the heavy responsibility of world revolution, we must truly master Mao Zedong Thought like Ouyang Hai.
    I will always remember the words left by my third brother, my old squad leader, in his diary: "Even if I am no longer in this world one day, I still sincerely believe that the truth of communism will surely triumph, and there will be more and more awakened people fighting for it!" I will never fail his hope, strive to study Chairman Mao's works well, firmly establish the proletarian world outlook, and fight to the end for the cause of communism.

    回忆欧阳海  学习欧阳海
   “欧阳海班”战士  欧阳湖
    我接到《欧阳海之歌》这本小说，恨不得一口气把它读完。这不仅是小说的主人公欧阳海是我的三哥，更重要的是：他是一个伟大的共产主义战士、我的老班长，他所走过的道路，正是我们青年人需要走的道路。
    在旧社会，我和欧阳海结在一根苦藤上，饱受着地主的压榨和欺凌。看到欧阳海领着弟弟讨饭这一节，作者虽然着墨不多，可是字字句句都象有千斤沉打在我心上，怎么也抑制不住自己的思想感情，泪水直往外涌，眼睛模糊了，那童年苦难的生活遭遇，顿时展现了出来。
    就象书中所描写的，解放前我和三哥身上缠着几块硬帮帮的烂布条子，在大风雪里到处讨饭。地主家的恶狗把我们哥俩咬得鲜血直流。当时我吓得哇哇叫，三哥紧紧地抱住我说：“弟弟不要哭，不要哭！”我抬头看看三哥，他真的没哭，没有一滴眼泪，只是愤怒地望着地主家的大门。
    一九四九年解放了，共产党和毛主席给我们穷人带来了幸福。我三哥背着红缨枪，他还当上了儿童团长哩！在村里站岗放哨，监视坏人。在斗争地主的大会上，他和群众一起，振臂高呼，打倒地主。
    正如小说作者所写的那样，他阶级立场鲜明，对地主、对阶级敌人，有着刻骨的仇恨。他对待贫下中农，对待缺少劳力的五保户，关怀备至，缺水挑水，缺柴送柴。有一年，因为他劳动好，社里奖给他一百多斤谷子，他拿出八十斤分给五保户。社里有五亩葵瓜子地要锄草，定为八十个工分，有的社员还觉得少了点。欧阳海站了出来说：“八十个工分不少了，我包下。”他没白没夜的干，两天就锄完了。他在自己工分簿上只记了二十个工分，有的富裕中农说他傻，欧阳海理直气壮地回答他们：“为了集体，我愿意做这个‘傻子’”。
    欧阳海从小就立下了当一名解放军战士的宏愿大志。他就对父亲、母亲说：“我要当解放军去，做个解放军那样的好人。”因为年岁小，又加上过去熬坏了身子，体质很单薄，几次都没有验得上。但他没有灰心。
    一九五九年，终于实现了他的愿望。我记得清清楚楚，他走的那天，万里无云，和暖的太阳射进凤凰村，射进我们家。他要走了，一切都准备停当了，他突然想起一桩事，跑进房子忙手忙脚地翻箱倒柜。他从箱子底下翻出一件烂得不象样子的绒衣往行李包里塞。我很纳闷，便问：“三哥，你带这样烂的绒衣到部队去干什么？”他严肃地说：“这是土改时斗地主分的，穿上它，就不会忘记过去的苦，也不会忘记对地主的仇恨，更不会忘记共产党和毛主席的恩情。”
    我握住他的手送他出村，他一次一次地嘱咐我：“四弟！现在我要走了，我是为了保卫我们穷人分得的田地，保卫我们幸福日子去参军的，你一定要在家好好劳动，听父亲母亲的话，做个好社员。”
    一九六○年军委和林副主席号召部队大学毛主席著作，给欧阳海指出了一条做一个毛主席的好战士的前进方向。他刻苦地读着毛主席的书。他在家里仅仅才读了两年书，而且这两年很大一部分时间跟着父亲劳动。书读得少，文化程度低，开始读起主席著作来有困难。这并没有难倒他，文化低就请教别人，不认识的字就查字典，又在生字旁边注上音。我翻开他学过的那部《毛泽东选集》，到处划满了圈圈杠杠和只有他自己才认识的符号。节日假日是他学习毛主席著作的最好时机，就是晚上睡觉前的几分钟或出差途中休息片刻也要翻开主席著作学上几行。毛主席的著作，无限地丰富了欧阳海的精神世界。他懂得了：“无产阶级要解放自己，就必须解放全人类”。他也懂得了：“人民革命的胜利是要千百万人的牺牲去换取的，为了胜利去承担这种牺牲，是我们共产党人最大的骄傲和愉快”。
    是什么力量使欧阳海从只看到凤凰村，到看到全中国，全世界？是毛主席的著作！
    是什么力量使欧阳海从一个要饭的乞丐成为一个伟大的共产主义战士？是毛主席的著作！
    我读完了《欧阳海之歌》，使我更进一步的懂得，我们年青一代要担负起世界革命的重任，就要象欧阳海那样真正把毛主席的思想学到手。
    我永远会记得我的三哥、我的老班长在日记中留下的话：“即使有一天这个世界上没有了我，我也仍然衷心地相信，共产主义的真理必然胜利，一定会有更多更多觉醒了的人，为它战斗！”我决不会辜负他的希望，努力把毛主席的著作学好，牢固地树立无产阶级世界观，为共产主义事业奋斗到底。
