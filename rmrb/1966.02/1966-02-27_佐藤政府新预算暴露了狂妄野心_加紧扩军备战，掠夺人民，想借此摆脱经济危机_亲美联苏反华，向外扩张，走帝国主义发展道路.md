　　The Sato government's new budget exposes arrogant ambitions
  　Stepping up military expansion, plundering the people, trying to escape the economic crisis
    Pro-American, allied with the Soviet Union, anti-China, expanding outward, taking the path of imperialist development
    The Japanese Sato government is facing an increasingly serious economic crisis. In order to alleviate economic difficulties, it has formulated a new national budget, strengthened the plunder of the Japanese people, accelerated the militarization of the Japanese economy, and at the same time stepped up the implementation of pro-American, allied with the Soviet Union, anti-China policies, actively carrying out economic and political expansion abroad, and further embarking on the path of imperialist development.
    Since the end of 1964, Japan has seen a situation of overproduction and financial instability. The market supply exceeded demand, and surplus products were seriously backlogged. Nine of the thirteen sectors of the national manufacturing industry experienced declines in production. At the same time, the number of bankruptcies and the scale of debts broke post-war records. Several large enterprises also declared bankruptcy, severely damaging the credit system. Under these circumstances, the Sato government successively lowered bank interest rates three times, issued more currency, and at the same time spared no effort to expand the fiscal deficit to provide emergency loans to monopoly capital, trying to solve economic difficulties through inflation. As these measures have had little effect, after entering 1966, the Sato government decided to further implement military expansion, intensify domestic plunder and foreign expansion, to seek a way out through a new national budget.
    According to publicly available materials from the Japanese government, the Sato government's proposed national budget for the 1966 fiscal year, which runs from April 1st to the end of next March, totals 4,314,277 million yen, an increase of approximately 18 percent over the previous year. The Sato government has also proposed a massive plan for fiscal investment in monopoly capital in the manner of state capital, with an investment figure as high as 2,027.2 billion yen. Combined, the Japanese government's new fiscal year spending will increase by approximately 1 trillion yen compared to last year.
    The oligarchs of the Japanese financial world are of course cheered by the Sato government’s budget to "overcome the economic recession." They hope that this huge budget and fiscal investment loan plan will enable them to tide over the difficulties, especially the so-called “public works” investment of 2,070 billion yen, which is used for the construction of roads, harbors, bridges, and high-end housing, etc., which is conducive to finding sales for severely overproduced commodities such as steel and cement.
    The Sato government's accelerating trend towards economic militarization is clearly reflected in the new budget. For several years, in order to seek a way out for its "high-speed growth" industrial production, the Japanese ruling group has implemented the Third Military Expansion Plan ahead of schedule, and is fully implementing the so-called "domestic production of weapons." In addition, with the recent intensification of collusion between Japan and the United States to create a so-called Northeast Asian military bloc, the direct and indirect military expenditures in Japan's new budget have further increased. Japan's direct military spending this year will reach 340.6 billion yen, an increase of 40 billion yen over last year. Expenditures in the name of "pensions" and "compensation" for former soldiers reached 153.7 billion yen, an increase of 23 billion yen over the previous year. There are various indirect military expenditures, such as the budgetary expenditure for the development of atomic energy, which accounts for 12.6 billion yen of the so-called “development of science and technology expenses” as high as 53.2 billion yen. In addition, there are rocket research expenses, military engineering expenses, and so on. It is said that orders for the Japanese arms production sector will also increase substantially.
    Externally, the Sato government is strengthening its political expansion in Asia and Africa, especially Southeast Asia, to promote further economic expansion. The main targets are South Korea, the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group, and Indonesia. In its new budget, the Sato government has added a so-called "special debt expense" of 8.88 billion yen to South Korea to strengthen Japan's economic penetration and control over South Korea. At the same time, under the name of so-called “developing foreign trade expenses,” Japan’s spending on commercial expansion in Southeast Asia this year will be 20 percent more than last year, of which the so-called “economic cooperation expenses” will be doubled compared to last year; another so-called “Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund” will even increase six-fold compared to last year. The Japanese government's ambition to rebuild its colonial sphere of influence is fully exposed.
    The Sato government regards China as the biggest obstacle to its expansion in Asia, so it is stepping up its collusion with the United States and uniting with the Soviet Union to form an anti-China alliance. It attempts to gain political and economic advantages through this alliance as capital for foreign expansion. The Sato government's active support for U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression against Vietnam, the conclusion of the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," and the adoption of "friendly diplomacy" towards the Soviet Union have exposed this point. However, for the Sato government, this is a dangerous path that can only result in lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet.
    The extreme expansion of budget expenditures will inevitably lead to intensified plunder of the Japanese people. Seventy-three percent of the more than 4.3 trillion yen in the new budget is actually obtained by increasing taxes; the remaining 17 percent, or more than 700 billion yen, is raised by the state issuing deficit bonds. In addition, the more than 2 trillion yen stipulated in the financial investment loan plan also aims at extracting money from the insurance premiums, "national pensions" of the broad masses of the people, as well as increasing various public utility fees and raising prices.
    The Japanese government's large-scale issuance of public bonds will inevitably further trigger inflation and cause prices to rise. Therefore, the vast strata of the Japanese people are worried that their lives will be further hit mercilessly.
    In order to conceal the reactionary nature of its new budget, the Sato government is currently clamoring loudly about a "300 billion yen tax cut." However, this is nothing more than a deceptive trick. Because in the so-called "300 billion yen tax cut," large enterprises receive as much as 180 billion yen in benefits, while for the vast working people, the annual increase of 400 billion yen in public utility expenses alone is enough to increase their burden greatly, not to mention obtaining any "tax cut" benefits.
    The Sato government's reactionary policy of intensifying the plunder of its own people and expanding outward will inevitably lead to greater opposition at home and abroad. The implementation of the new budget will further sharpen class contradictions in Japan and accelerate the vigorous development of the Japanese people's revolutionary movement.

　　佐藤政府新预算暴露了狂妄野心
  　加紧扩军备战，掠夺人民，想借此摆脱经济危机
    亲美联苏反华，向外扩张，走帝国主义发展道路
    日本佐藤政府面临着日益严重的经济危机。为了缓和经济困难，它制定新的国家预算，加强对日本人民的掠夺，加速日本经济的军事化，同时加紧推行亲美联苏反华政策，积极向外进行经济和政治扩张，进一步走上帝国主义发展道路。
    从一九六四年底开始，日本就出现了生产过剩和金融不稳局面。市场供过于求，过剩产品严重积压，全国制造工业的十三个部门就有九个部门生产下降。同时，企业倒闭数目和负债规模打破战后纪录。若干大企业也宣告破产，使信贷体系遭到严重破坏。在这种情况下，佐藤政府连续三次降低银行利率，增发货币，同时不惜以扩大财政赤字的办法来为垄断资本提供紧急贷款，力图用通货膨胀来解决经济困难。由于这些措施收效不大，在进入一九六六年以后，佐藤政府决定通过新的国家预算，进一步实行扩军备战，加紧对内掠夺和对外扩张，来谋求出路。
    据日本官方公开发表的材料，佐藤政府这次提出的从四月一日开始到明年三月底止的一九六六财政年度国家预算，总开支达四万三千一百四十二亿七千万日元，比上年度增加了约百分之十八。佐藤政府还提出了以国家资本方式向垄断资本进行财政投资的庞大计划，其投资数字高达二万零二百七十二亿日元。两项合计，日本政府新财政年度的开支比去年增加约一万亿日元之多。
    日本财政界的寡头们，对于佐藤政府的这个
  “克服经济萧条”的预算，当然感到欢欣鼓舞。他们指望这个庞大的预算和财政投资贷款计划，能使他们度过难关，特别是其中有二万零七百亿日元的所谓“公共事业”投资，都用于修建道路、港湾、桥梁和高级住宅等等，有利于使严重生产过剩的钢铁、水泥等商品找到了销路。
    佐藤政府加紧经济军事化的动向，很明显地在新预算中反映出来。几年以来，日本统治集团为了给它的“高速度增长”的工业生产谋求出路，提前实行了第三次扩军计划，全力实行所谓“武器国产化”。加以最近日美加紧勾结，大搞所谓东北亚军事集团，日本新预算中直接、间接用于军事开支的费用，有了进一步的上升。日本的直接军费今年将达三千四百零六亿日元，比去年增加了四百亿日元。以给旧军人“养老金”、“抚恤金”为名义的开支，达到一千五百三十七亿日元，比去年度增加二百三十亿日元。各种间接军费名目繁多，如在高达五百三十二亿日元的所谓“发展科学技术费”中，发展原子能的预算开支就占了一百二十六亿日元。此外，还有火箭研究费、军事工程费等等。对日本军火生产部门的订货，据说也将有大幅度增加。
    在对外方面，佐藤政府加强对亚非地区特别是东南亚进行政治扩张，借以促进经济扩张的进一步扩大。主要对象是南朝鲜、台湾蒋介石集团和印度尼西亚等地区。佐藤政府在新预算中增设了所谓给南朝鲜“特别债务费”八十八亿八千万日元，作为加强日本对南朝鲜的经济渗透和控制。同时，在所谓“发展对外贸易费”名义下，日本今年向东南亚地区进行商业扩张的费用，将比去年多百分之二十，其中的所谓“经济合作费”则将比去年多一倍；另一项所谓“海外经济合作基金”，甚至将比去年增加六倍。日本政府重建殖民势力范围的野心，暴露无遗。
    佐藤政府把中国看成是它向亚洲扩张的最大障碍，于是便同美国加紧勾结，并联合苏联，组成反华联盟。它企图通过这种联盟，在政治上和经济上捞一把，作为向外扩张的资本。最近以来佐藤政府积极支持美帝国主义侵越政策，缔结“日韩条约”和对苏联采取“亲善外交”，就暴露了这一点。但是，对佐藤政府来说，这是一条危险的道路，结果只能搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    预算开支的极度膨胀，必然要加紧向日本人民大肆进行搜刮。新预算四万三千多亿日元开支的百分之七十三，实际上就是靠加重税收来取得的；其余百分之十七，即七千多亿日元，则是靠国家发行赤字公债来筹集。此外，财政投资的贷款计划所规定的二万多亿日元，也是从广大人民的保险费、“国民养老金”以及提高各种公用事业费用和抬高物价等上面打主意。
    日本政府大量发行公债，必将进一步引起通货膨胀，造成物价上涨。因此，日本广大阶层人民都在担心他们的生活将进一步遭到无情打击。
    为了掩饰自己新预算的反动本质，佐藤政府目前正在大肆喧嚷什么将进行“三千亿日元大减税”。但是，这不过是蒙骗手法。因为在所谓三千亿日元的“大减税”中，大企业所受到的实惠高达一千八百亿日元之多，而广大劳动人民，则仅仅公共事业费用一年上涨四千亿日元，就足以使他们增加很大的负担，更谈不到获得什么“减税”的好处了。
    佐藤政府加紧掠夺本国人民和向外扩张的反动政策，必将使它在国内外遭到更大的反对。新预算的实施就会使日本国内阶级矛盾进一步尖锐化，加速日本人民革命运动的蓬勃发展。
