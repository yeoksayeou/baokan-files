    What are you coming to Daqing for?
    Driller Bian Mengkun
    Some comrades say: Daqing is a place where the work is hard and the living environment is poor. I think this kind of statement forgets the fundamentals. The reason our country has been able to become strong, the reason the label of backwardness in oil can be thrown into the ninth heaven, isn't it because of the hard struggle of our predecessors? Today's Daqing is many times better than it was at the beginning of the campaign. Today's Daqing didn't fall from the sky, it is the result of Daqing people holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and struggling arduously. Difficulties cannot scare real revolutionaries, they are only effective against cowards. If you want revolution, you must have the spirit of enduring hardship and not fearing any difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more serious the test for a revolutionary. We must never forget hard work. How to take over the older generation's wrench - gun, and continue fighting, how to learn hard skills, and work for the oil field for a lifetime, are things we should often consider.

    来大庆，为了什么？
    钻工　边梦坤
    有些同志说：大庆这地方，工作艰苦，生活环境差。我认为，这种说法就是忘了本。我们国家之所以能强大起来，石油落后帽子之所以能抛到九霄云外，不就是靠前辈们艰苦奋斗得来的吗？大庆的今天，比会战开始时，条件不知好上多少倍了。大庆的今天，不是天上掉下来的，是大庆人高举毛泽东思想红旗，艰苦奋斗的结果。困难这东西，吓不倒真正的革命者，只能对胆小鬼有效。要革命，就得有吃苦、不怕任何困难的精神。越是艰苦地方，越是对一个革命者的严重考验。艰苦奋斗，我们决不能忘记。如何接过老前辈的扳手——枪杆子，战斗下去，如何学习过硬本领，为油田干一辈子，是我们应该经常考虑的。
