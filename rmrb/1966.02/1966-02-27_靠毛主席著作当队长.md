    Comrade Qin Xiuying is twenty-nine years old, illiterate, and was elected as the captain of the production team. The burden is heavy enough, and the difficulties are great enough. What force made her dare to take on heavy burdens, overcome all difficulties, and lead the masses to change the world? It is because she read Chairman Mao's books. She is:
　　Relying on Chairman Mao's Works to Be a Team Leader
　　Qin Xiuying, Captain of Huyu Production Brigade, Sitou Commune, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province
    Our brigade used to be famous for two things: one for being poor, and the other for being backward. In the past, the mountains in our area were bare; the gullies were barren; the rivers were dry; and the land was thin. Seven hundred and ten people cultivated seven hundred and sixty-six mu of "dry bone" land where picking up stones was like picking up sand, with very low yields and little income. Because the Party's policies were not earnestly implemented, our work had been lagging behind for many years. Some people said, "Pingshun produces the southern countryside, and Huyu is the most backward."
    In 1965, the poor and backward face of our area began to change. Five hundred mu of forest were created on the mountains, and 28,100 trees were planted, creating tree-covered hills; more than 1,000 mu of grass were also cultivated.
    Among the 766 mu of cultivated land, 300 mu have been built into Dazhai-style farmland. In the face of a drought unseen for over a hundred years, the broad masses of commune members displayed the spirit of "the Foolish Old Man" and stubbornly resisted the drought, increasing the yield per mu by 44 jin compared to 1964.
    Thousands of years of poverty and many years of backwardness have begun to change. While everyone enthusiastically encouraged our brigade, they also encouraged me. Every time I was encouraged by everyone, I thought about the road I had traveled in 1965. What abilities do I have? Isn't it all because Chairman Mao's works gave me revolutionary strength?
    Vow to Have the Foolish Old Man's Ambition, Study Without Fear of Difficulty
    I am twenty-nine years old this year. In the spring of 1965, I had just taken office as the brigade leader, and difficulties came one after another, overwhelming me. Some people said, "A young girl holding the big seal, Huyu will become even more backward." What gave me the biggest headache was that the cadres were not of one mind. Six of the twelve branch committee members and management committee members were original veteran cadres, and six were young people newly elected in 1965. The Party branch secretary was also a newly appointed young person. Just after taking office, the work command was ineffective. I was worried by the work, and I cried from being angered by unpleasant things. Crying and worrying were still no help. Later, I hardened my heart, made up my mind, and went to the commune Party committee to "hand over the seal."
    In the office of the commune Party committee, I reported the difficulties in my work and my own situation. Finally, risking criticism and punishment, I hardened my head and proposed to "hand over the seal." At that time, the commune Party committee secretary neither criticized me nor said whether the "seal" was allowed to be handed over or not. He asked me to study Chairman Mao's works well. I was a beggar when I was a child, and later the daughter of a poor tenant farmer. I never went to school since I was a child, and now I am still illiterate. I said to the Party committee secretary, "I can't read, so it's difficult to study Chairman Mao's books." The Party committee secretary still did not answer my question directly, saying, "Then you should study 'The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains' first." He also told me, "Chairman Mao said: 'Nothing is hard in this world if you put your heart into it.'"
    The words of the commune Party committee carried great weight. When I returned home, I asked Wu Lanzhe, the director of the commune women's federation who was stationed in Huyu, to read "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." After reading it again and again, I understood it more and more deeply. In particular, the instruction to "make up your mind, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" touched my heart even more. I thought that if the Foolish Old Man had the ambition to dig up the Taihang and Wangwu Mountains, and the people of the whole country had the ambition to dig up the three mountains of imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism, could I not overcome the difficulty of being illiterate and unable to read? I was determined to be a "thoughtful" and ambitious person like the "Foolish Old Man," and with the determination to "fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," break through the difficulty of being illiterate and unable to read, and learn Mao Zedong Thought.
    With the determination to study, what to do if I am illiterate? If I can't read it myself, I will ask others to read it. I asked the comrades stationed in Huyu to read it, the county and commune cadres temporarily sent to our brigade to read it, and the educated youth in the township to read it, extensively seeking teachers. My husband, Hou Linze, works at the post and telecommunications office and does not come home for many days at a time, but every time he comes back, I always make him read until late at night.
    Asking others to read specifically is limited. In order to learn more, I would actively go up to listen when I saw others studying. I never missed peasant lecture halls and political classes in people's schools lecturing on Chairman Mao's works. I never missed listening to commune members studying Chairman Mao's works in the fields, and I often went to commune members' homes to listen at night.
    In this way, in 1965, I successively studied thirty-one articles by Chairman Mao, some of which I studied more than a dozen or twenty times. The more I learned, the more I thought, the more I compared, the deeper my understanding became.
    Eyes Brighten and Mind Opens, Lofty Ambition Moves Mountains and Rivers
    A dim lamp is only afraid of being turned off. After studying Chairman Mao's works, I stood taller, saw further, my revolutionary determination became greater, and my methods for doing work also increased.
    After studying Chairman Mao's works, I solved three problems ideologically.
    1.  Established the determination to carry the revolution through to the end.
    Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry the revolution through to the end" deeply educated me. From the fable of the farmer and the snake, I thought of my plan to hand over the "seal" of the brigade leader. I thought, now that our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction have achieved great victories, are the landlords, rich peasants, and capitalist forces not like that frozen snake? My unwillingness to be the brigade leader is because I am unwilling to lead the masses to continue the revolution. If I don't be the brigade leader, and he doesn't be the brigade leader, and no one continues the revolution, isn't this creating conditions for the snake to wake up? What will be the consequences of this in the future? Thinking of this, I also thought of my family history. My ancestral home was originally in Lin County, Henan Province. Because of the pressure of life, my parents fled to Pingshun, Shanxi, and suffered all kinds of torture and bullying in the man-eating old society. It was not easy to wait for the Communist Party to come, and they turned over politically and economically. I must never go back to the old road, and I must never let thousands upon thousands of class brothers go back to the old road again. Since everyone trusts me, I must lead everyone to do it. From then on, I dispelled the idea of "handing over the seal."
    2.  Eliminated the fear of difficulty.
    To be honest, after a period of ideological struggle in the spring, I did not "hand over the seal," but my heavy mood did not lighten. Huyu was backward, and the foundation of work in all aspects was poor. My mind was full of difficulties, and I could not lift my head. When I encountered this situation, I would ask Comrade Wu Lanzhe to select some of Chairman Mao's words about how to overcome difficulties and read them to me. In response to my thinking, she repeatedly read to me several passages from "On the Chongqing Negotiations" and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" about acknowledging difficulties, analyzing difficulties, and fighting against difficulties. I repeatedly recited and repeatedly thought about Chairman Mao's instructions, and I understood two problems ideologically: one is that doing revolution must have difficulties. What kind of revolution would it be without difficulties? The work in Huyu has difficulties, so it is right for me, a Communist Party member, to take on this burden. If there were no difficulties, what would I, the brigade leader, do? The second is that we must resolutely fight difficulties. As long as we do as Chairman Mao said, "make up our minds, fear no sacrifice," we can overcome all difficulties and achieve victory. After understanding these principles, I became bolder and could withstand nails hitting me. Later, I successively studied "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Attention to Working Methods," "Methods of Work of Party Committees," and Chairman Mao's instructions on democratic style and mass line, and I had more methods, and I was even less afraid of difficulties in my work.
    3.  Established a great ambition to change the world.
    As soon as I took over the "seal" of the brigade leader, the commune Party committee gave me a task - to change the face of Huyu. It was required to change every year and change greatly in five years. Whether it could be changed or not, I had no confidence in my heart in the past, but after reading Chairman Mao's works, I had confidence in my heart. Chairman Mao said in "Introducing a Cooperative": "In addition to other characteristics, the salient feature of China's 600 million people is that they are poor and blank. These seem like bad things, but they are actually good things. Poverty gives rise to the desire for change, to work, to revolution. A blank sheet of paper, without burden, is good for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures." I repeatedly pondered the meaning of this passage. Chairman Mao's profound teachings reminded me. Yes! The natural conditions in Huyu are not good, which seems like a bad thing, but there are many mountains, which can be used to plant trees and develop forestry and animal husbandry, and grow medicinal materials; there are many gullies, which can be used to build dams and repair land; the land is not good, but it can be processed and repaired, and the potential for increased production is great; commune members live scattered and can build forests, build dams and repair land, and cultivate crops nearby, isn't this also a good thing? Huyu is poor, isn't it precisely that poverty gives rise to the desire for change? Chairman Mao's words pointed out the direction for me, encouraged my courage, and established the great ambition to lead the masses, change the world, and build a new Huyu, determined to make a big change in 1965.
    Chairman Mao's Words, Flexibly Applied Everywhere
    To lead the masses to change the world, we must first have a strong leadership core and a fighting fortress as united as iron. But the twenty-two Party members of our branch were not of one mind, and the twelve Party branch committee members and management committee members were "four teams of horses." The masses said we were "potatoes poured out of a bag - each rolling around randomly." Why is this so? The branch secretary and I consulted Chairman Mao's works with this question. First, according to "On Contradiction," we analyzed the nature of the contradiction. From various manifestations, we found that the main contradiction was the contradiction between new and old cadres. Some of the original veteran cadres were not convinced by our "young lads" and "young girls." They did not attend meetings when we convened them; sometimes they attended meetings, but they did not say anything when discussing issues. And the newly appointed cadres did not respect the veteran cadres enough. After the contradictions were found, we studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "new and old cadres should respect each other, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, in order to unite and carry out common cause..." and further clarified the importance of unity between new and old cadres; studying Chairman Mao's "Methods of Work of Party Committees", "We must not only be good at uniting with comrades who agree with us, but also be good at uniting with comrades who disagree with us to work together", made our eyes clearer and our minds brighter. From the beginning of February to the end of February, for twenty consecutive nights, we held more than twenty branch committee meetings, studied ten articles by Chairman Mao such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "Combat Liberalism," and carried out criticism and self-criticism. Later, in specific work, we took the initiative to start with ourselves. If they did not attend the meeting, Comrade Guo Wuze and I personally ran several miles to the mountain village where they lived to invite them; we took the initiative to discuss with them and ask them for advice before making major decisions.
    It was in this way that we turned the cadres and Party members into a single force according to Chairman Mao's instructions. The commune members said that we, a group of randomly rolling potatoes, were put into a cloth bag.
    After the ideology of the cadres and Party members was unified, another prominent issue was how to unify the ideology of the masses and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses to change the world.
    At the mention of changing the world and fundamentally changing the face of Huyu, some commune members were pessimistic and discouraged, lacking confidence, saying, "If Huyu could be changed, our ancestors would have changed it long ago, and we wouldn't have waited until now," "You young people can change it, change it, we don't have the heart to eat stars, and we can't enjoy that kind of blessing."
    Is it that the commune members are unwilling to change the face of Huyu? No. It is that the poverty of this mountain for many years has hurt the commune members. Faced with this situation, what to do? Chairman Mao's teaching that "The serious problem is educating the peasants" reminded me. Chairman Mao's book educated us, so we used Chairman Mao's book to educate the masses. We organized the masses to earnestly study articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." While studying, we organized a group of cadres and commune members to visit the Xigou Brigade led by Li Shunda. At the same time, we also formulated a five-year construction plan, talking about the prospects of Huyu, and in addition to speaking at various meetings and writing on blackboards, branch committee members and cadres also went to various mountain villages to visit households for propaganda. The masses listened to Chairman Mao's words and saw the future, and the fire of changing the world was ignited.
    The enthusiasm of the masses has risen. To lead this struggle to change the world well, we must use the enthusiasm of the masses on the cutting edge. We young people have no experience in organizing large-scale mass movements to fight against heaven and earth, especially I, a woman, lack production knowledge. We still use the old method, consulting Chairman Mao's works with questions. Chairman Mao said, "We can learn things we didn't understand before," "We must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are)." We were educated by these instructions. I thought, what are we afraid of if we have no experience? Turning over a ridge is an expert teacher - Xigou. If we don't understand, we learn from Xigou. This resulted in the event of studying Xigou three times a year. Studying Xigou three times learned the experience of building mountainous areas and avoided detours in our mountainous construction. The achievements we made in construction last year should be attributed to Chairman Mao's teachings, and we should also thank the teacher - the selfless help of the people of Xigou.

### 靠毛主席著作当队长
秦秀英
1966-02-27
第3版()
专栏：

    秦秀英同志现年二十九岁，大字不识，被选举为生产大队的队长，担子是够重的，困难是够大的。是什么力量使她敢于挑重担子，排除一切困难，带领群众改天换地，是由于她读了毛主席的书。她是：
　　靠毛主席著作当队长
　　山西省平顺县寺头公社虎窑大队队长　秦秀英
    我们大队过去有两出名：一出名穷，二出名落后。过去我们那里的山，是光的；沟，是荒的；河，是干的；地，是薄的。七百一十口人，耕种着七百六十六亩拣了石头是沙子的“干骨头”地，产量很低，收入很少。因为对党的政策贯彻执行不认真，多年来工作老是拉在后边。有人说：“平顺出南乡，落后数虎窑”。
    一九六五年，我们那里穷和落后的面貌开始在变了。山上造了五百亩林，栽了两万八千一百棵树，有了长树的山头；还育了一千多亩草。
    七百六十六亩耕地中，已经有三百亩建成大寨式的农田。在百来年没有过的大旱情况下，广大社员发扬了“愚公”精神，顽强抗击旱灾，每亩地的产量比一九六四年还增产四十四斤。
    千百年的穷，多年的老落后，开始有了变化。大家在热情地鼓励俺们大队的同时，也鼓励我。我每次受到大家的鼓励，就想到一九六五年走过的路。我有什么能耐？还不是全凭毛主席著作给了我革命的力量。
    立下愚公志　学习不怕难
    我今年二十九岁。一九六五年春天，我刚担任大队长，困难就一个接一个劈头盖脑地压来。有人说：“黄毛丫头掌大印，虎窑后进再后进。”使我最头痛的是干部们不一心。十二个支委、管委委员，六个是原来的老干部，六个是一九六五年新选的年轻人。党支部书记也是新上任的年轻人。刚上台，工作指挥不灵，我被工作压得愁一阵，又被不顺心的事气得哭一顿。哭了，愁了，还是没办法。后来，心一横，拿定主意，到公社党委“交印”。
    在公社党委的办公室里，我汇报了工作中的困难和我自己的处境。最后拼着挨批评，受处分，硬着头皮提出了“交印”。当时公社党委书记一没有批评我，二没说这“印”是允许交还是不允许交。他要我回去好好学习毛主席著作。我小时是个叫化子，后来是穷佃户的女儿，从小没有念过书，现在还是个睁眼瞎子。我给党委书记说：“我不识字，学毛主席的书有困难。”党委书记还是没有正面回答我的问题，说：“那你就先学《愚公移山》吧。”并告诉我说：“毛主席说过：世上无难事，只怕有心人。”
    公社党委的话分量很重。我回到家里，就请在虎窑蹲点的公社妇联主任吴兰则同志念《愚公移山》。念了一遍又一遍，我越听理解越深刻。特别是“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的指示，更打动了我的心。心想愚公有志挖太行、王屋两座大山，全国人民有志，挖掉了帝国主义、官僚资本主义和封建主义三座大山，难道自己就不能攻下学习这道难关。我下定决心要象“愚公”那样做一个“有心”、有志气的人，以“不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的决心，冲破不识字读不了书的困难，把毛泽东思想学到手。
    有了学习的决心，不识字怎么办？自己读不下来，就请别人念。请在虎窑蹲点的同志念，请临时下乡到俺大队的县、社干部念，请在乡的知识青年念，广拜老师。我男人侯林则在邮电所工作，多日不回一次家，但他回来一次，我总是让他念到后半夜才罢手。
    专门请别人念是有限的，为了多学些东西，我看到别人学习，就主动凑上去听。农民讲习所、民校政治课讲毛主席著作，我总不缺席，社员们在地里学毛主席著作，我总不误了听，晚上还常常找到社员家里去听。
    就这样，一九六五年我先后学习了三十一篇毛主席的文章，其中有的学了十几遍，二十遍。学的多了，想得多了，比的多了，领会就深刻了。
    眼亮心开窍　壮志移山河
    灯不明只怕一拨，学习了毛主席著作我站得高了，看得远了，革命的决心大了，做工作的办法也就多了。
    学了毛主席著作，我在思想上解决了三个问题。
    一、树立了将革命进行到底的决心。
    毛主席“将革命进行到底”的指示，使我受到深刻的教育。我从农夫和毒蛇的寓言中，想到了我准备交大队长“印”的事。我想，现在我们国家社会主义革命和社会主义建设取得了巨大胜利，地主、富农和资本主义势力，不正象那条冻僵的毒蛇吗？我不愿当队长，就是不愿意领导群众继续进行革命。我不当大队长，他也不当大队长，都不当大队长，都不继续革命，这不是给毒蛇的苏醒创造了条件吗？这将来会有个什么后果？想到这里，我又想起了我的家史。我老家原籍河南林县，因为生活所逼，爹妈才逃难来到山西平顺，在吃人的旧社会受尽了折磨和欺负，好容易才盼来了共产党，政治上、经济上翻了身。我决不能回到老路上去，也决不能让千千万万的阶级兄弟再回到老路上去，既然大家信得过我，我就要领着大家干。从此，我打消了“交印”的念头。
    二、消除了畏难情绪。
    说实在话，在春天经过一番思想斗争，“印”是不交了，但是沉重的心情可没轻松了。虎窑落后，各方面的工作基础都差，脑子里左也是困难，右也是困难，难得抬不起头来。遇到这时，我就向吴兰则同志请求，她把毛主席说的怎样克服困难的话，挑选一些给我念念。她针对我的思想，给我反复念了《关于重庆谈判》、《愚公移山》中有关要承认困难，分析困难，向困难斗争的几段话。对毛主席的这些指示，我反复地背，反复地想，在思想上想通了两个问题：一个是干革命就要有困难，没有困难还算什么革命，虎窑工作有困难，才让我这个共产党员挑这付担子，如果没有困难，还要我这个大队长干甚？二是有困难要坚决斗争，只要照毛主席说的“下定决心，不怕牺牲”，就能排除万难，取得胜利。明白了这些道理以后，胆子壮了，也就经得起钉子碰了。以后又相继学习了《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》、《党委会的工作方法》以及毛主席有关民主作风、群众路线的指示，办法也多了，对工作中的困难就更不怕了。
    三、立了一个改天换地的大志。
    我刚接上大队长的“印”，公社党委就给我一项任务——改变虎窑面貌。要求一年变个样，五年大变样。到底能不能变，过去心里没底，后来读了毛主席著作，心里有了底了。毛主席在《介绍一个合作社》中说过：“除了别的特点之外，中国六亿人口的显著特点是一穷二白。这些看起来是坏事，其实是好事。穷则思变，要干，要革命。一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”我反复琢磨这段话的意思，毛主席深刻的教导提醒了我。是啊！虎窑的自然条件不好，看起来是坏事，但是山多，可以大量植树造林，发展畜牧业，种药材；沟多可以大量闸沟修地；土地不好，加工整修，增产潜力大，社员居住分散可以就近营造林木，闸沟修地，作务庄稼，这不也是好事吗？虎窑穷，不正是穷则思变？毛主席的话，给我指明了方向，鼓舞了我的勇气，树立了领导群众，改天换地，建设新虎窑的大志，决心在一九六五年就来个大变样。
    毛主席的话　活用处处灵
    领导群众改天换地，首先得有个坚强的领导核心和团结得象铁一样的战斗堡垒。可是我们支部的二十二个党员不一心，十二个党支部委员和管委会委员，是“四套马车”。群众说我们是“口袋里倒出来的山药蛋——个是个的乱滚。”为什么这样呢？我和支部书记带着这个问题向毛主席著作请教。首先根据《矛盾论》，分析了矛盾的性质。从各种表现中，找到主要矛盾是新老干部的矛盾。原来的老干部有的不服我们这“年轻小伙子”和“黄毛丫头”的劲。召集开会，他们不参加；有时参加会议，讨论问题时，他们不吭气。而新上任的干部，对老干部尊重不够。矛盾找出来了，我们又学习了毛主席“新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业……”的教导，进一步明确了新老干部团结的重要性；学习了毛主席《党委会的工作方法》中的“我们不仅要善于团结和自己意见相同的同志，而且要善于团结和自己意见不同的同志一道工作”，更心清眼亮了。从二月初到二月底的一个月中，连续二十个晚上，我们开了二十多次支委会会议，学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《反对自由主义》等十篇毛主席著作，开展批评和自我批评。以后在具体工作中，我们主动从自己做起，开会他们不参加，我和郭五则同志亲自跑几里路，到他们住的山庄上去请；决定重大事情之前主动同他们商量，向他们请教。
    我们就是这样根据毛主席的指示，把党员干部扭成了一股劲。社员们说我们这伙乱滚的山药蛋，用一条布袋装起来了。
    干部党员思想统一了，另一个突出的问题，就是怎样把群众的思想统一起来，充分调动群众改天换地的积极性。
    一提改天换地，从根本上改变虎窑的面貌，有些社员悲观泄气，信心不足，说什么“虎窑如果能变，老祖先早就让它变了，等不到现在”，“你们年轻人能变，变吧，咱没吃星星的心，也享受不了那样的福”。
    是社员不愿改变虎窑的面貌吗？不是。是多少年来穷这座大山，把社员压伤了。面对这样的情况，怎么办？毛主席的“严重的问题是教育农民”的教导提醒了我。毛主席的书教育了我们，我们就用毛主席的书去教育群众。我们组织群众认真学习了《愚公移山》等文章。一边学习一边组织一部分干部和社员到李顺达领导的西沟大队去参观。同时，还制订了一个五年建设规划，大讲虎窑的前景，除了各种会议上讲，黑板报上写以外，支委、干部还分别到各个山庄登门上户作宣传。群众听了毛主席的话，看到了前途，改天换地的大火就点起来了。
    群众的干劲起来了，领导好这场改天换地的斗争，就把群众的积极性用在刀刃上。我们这伙年轻人，组织大规模的战天斗地的群众运动没经验，特别我这个妇女更缺乏生产知识。我们还是老办法，带着问题向毛主席著作请教。毛主席说：“我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西”，“我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作”。我们从这些指示中受到了教育。我想，没经验怕什么，翻一道岭就是内行老师——西沟。不懂就向西沟学。这样就出了一年三学西沟的事。三学西沟，学到了建设山区的经验，避免了我们在山区建设上的弯路。去年我们建设上取得成绩，应该归功于毛主席的教导，还应该感谢老师——西沟人无私的帮助。
