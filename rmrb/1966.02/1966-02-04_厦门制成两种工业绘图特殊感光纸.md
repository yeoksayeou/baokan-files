    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 2nd -- Two kinds of special blueprint paper for reproducing industrial drawings—drawing enlargement paper and positive image reproduction paper—have recently been successfully trial-produced at the Xiamen Sensitized Chemical Factory and have been officially put into production.
    Industrial design drawings generally require three processes, which are very time-consuming. The newly produced "Drawing Enlargement Paper" is a thin photographic paper coated with a silver halide sensitizer. When using it, place the pencil drawing under eight 40-watt fluorescent lights, photograph it with movie film, and then print it on this sensitized paper to make a blueprint. This method is twenty times more efficient than manual tracing, and the resulting drawings have clear lines and characters and can be stored for a long time without fading. The newly produced positive image reproduction paper allows pencil-drawn sketches or documents to be exposed for a few seconds under fluorescent lights using a contact printing method. After developing, fixing, and rinsing, a replica identical to the original can be obtained.

    厦门制成两种工业绘图特殊感光纸
    新华社福州二日电　两种供复制工业绘图用的特殊感光纸——图文放大纸和正象复印纸，最近在厦门市感光化学厂试制成功，并已正式投入生产。
    工业设计绘图，一般都要经过三道工序，很费工时。新制成的“图文放大纸”是一种采用卤化银感光剂涂布的薄照相纸。使用时把铅笔图放在八支四十瓦日光灯下，用电影胶卷照下来，然后再印在这种感光纸上，就制成了蓝图。这一方法比手工描图提高效率二十倍，而且制成的图纸线条、字迹都很清楚，可以长期保存不褪色。新制成的正象复印纸，可以把铅笔绘制的草图或文献资料，通过接触印相方法，用日光灯曝光几秒钟，经过显影、定影和漂洗后，就可以得到一张与原稿一模一样的复制品。
