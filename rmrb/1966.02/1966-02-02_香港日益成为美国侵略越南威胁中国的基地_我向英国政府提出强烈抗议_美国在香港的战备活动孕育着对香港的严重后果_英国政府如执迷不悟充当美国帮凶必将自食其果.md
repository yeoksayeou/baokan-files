    Xinhua News Agency, 1st – Vice Foreign Minister Wang Bingnan summoned British Chargé d'Affaires to China, Mr. Hopson, this afternoon and delivered to the British Chargé d'Affaires Office in China a note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, lodging another strong protest with the British government regarding its provision of Hong Kong to the United States as a base of operations for expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam and for war threats and nuclear blackmail against China.
    The note first pointed out that the Chinese government has noted that on January 26, the U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and the nuclear-powered warship "Bainbridge," participating in the war of aggression against Vietnam, successively arrived in Hong Kong. As of January 31, the number of U.S. warships participating in the war of aggression against Vietnam gathered in Hong Kong had reached as many as nine, and these ships will continue to sail to the waters of Vietnam to participate in combat.
    The note pointed out that precisely when the United States is continuously expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, openly announced on January 31 the resumption of bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and brazenly clamored to attack China, U.S. nuclear-powered and other warships frequently entered and concentrated in Hong Kong. Commander Miller of the U.S. Third Carrier Division on the "Enterprise" even openly hosted reporters in Hong Kong, flaunting aggressive force, clamoring for war, and carrying out nuclear threats. This cannot but be a serious provocation against the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the people of Southeast Asian countries. All the facts show that the United States is increasingly unscrupulously using Hong Kong as a base of operations for its war of aggression against Vietnam and is even attempting to use Hong Kong as a springboard for its future attack on the Chinese mainland.
    The note then pointed out that in its note of September 1, 1965, the Chinese government had lodged a serious protest with the British government regarding the British government's permission for the United States to use Hong Kong as a base of aggression. In its reply note of October 11, 1965, the British government attempted to deny this, insisting that "Hong Kong is not being used by the United States armed forces as a base for military activities directed against China or other areas." In fact, since that time, the British government has not only failed to take effective measures to stop the U.S. war preparations in Hong Kong, but has instead intensified its actions, allowing the United States to increasingly rampantly use Hong Kong as a base to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam and threaten China's security. According to reports, in 1965, more than 300 visits by U.S. aggressor warships were made to Hong Kong, and from November 1965 to January 1966 alone, more than 100 U.S. warships sailed to Hong Kong.
    The note emphasized that the concentration of U.S. nuclear-powered warships "Enterprise" and "Bainbridge" in Hong Kong this time further exposed the British government's willingness to intensify its collusion with the U.S. government, providing Hong Kong to the United States as a base of operations for expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam and for war threats and nuclear blackmail against the People's Republic of China.
    The note concluded by emphasizing that U.S. war preparations in Hong Kong breed grave consequences for Hong Kong. With China's security increasingly threatened, the Chinese government wishes to once again remind the British government to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages. The British government must immediately take effective measures to stop all U.S. war preparations in Hong Kong, so that Hong Kong will no longer become a base for U.S. aggression. If the British government persists in its errors, willingly acting as an accomplice of the U.S. aggressors, and insists on being an enemy of the Vietnamese people, the Chinese people, and the people of Southeast Asian countries, it will inevitably suffer the consequences.

    香港日益成为美国侵略越南威胁中国的基地
    我向英国政府提出强烈抗议
    美国在香港的战备活动孕育着对香港的严重后果
    英国政府如执迷不悟充当美国帮凶必将自食其果
    新华社一日讯　我国外交部副部长王炳南今天下午召见英国驻华代办霍普森，递交我国外交部给英国驻华代办处的一项照会，就英国政府提供香港给美国作为扩大侵略越南战争和对我国进行战争威胁和核讹诈的活动基地，再一次向英国政府提出强烈的抗议。
    照会首先指出，中国政府注意到，一月二十六日，参加侵略越南战争的美国核动力航空母舰“企业号”、核动力军舰“班布里奇号”相继开抵香港。至一月三十一日为止，聚集在香港的参加侵略越南战争的美国军舰达到九艘之多，这些舰只还将继续开往越南海面参加作战。
    照会指出，正当美国不断扩大侵略越南的战争，一月三十一日公然宣布恢复对越南民主共和国轰炸，并且狂妄地叫嚣要进攻中国的时候，美国的核动力及其他军舰频繁进出并集中在香港，“企业号”上的美国第三航空母舰分舰队司令米勒还公然在香港招待记者，炫耀侵略武力，叫嚣战争，进行核威胁，这不能不是对越南人民、中国人民和东南亚各国人民的严重挑衅。种种事实说明，美国正在更加肆无忌惮地利用香港作为它进行侵略越南战争的活动基地，并进而企图把香港用作它将来进攻中国大陆的跳板。
    照会接着指出，中国政府在一九六五年九月一日的照会中，曾就英国政府容许美国利用香港作为侵略基地问题，向英国政府提出严正抗议。英国政府在一九六五年十月十一日的复照中妄图抵赖，硬说什么“香港并不是被美国军队用来作为进行针对中国或其他地区的军事活动基地”。事实上，从那个时候以来，英国政府不仅没有采取有效措施，制止美国在香港的各项战备活动，反而变本加厉，容许美国日益猖狂地利用香港作为基地，扩大侵略越南的战争，威胁中国的安全。据报道，一九六五年进入香港的美国侵略军军舰达到三百多艘次，而从一九六五年十一月到一九六六年一月，开到香港的美国军舰就有一百多艘次。
    照会着重指出，这次美国“企业号”和“班布里奇号”核动力军舰集中到香港活动，更进一步暴露了英国政府不惜同美国政府加紧勾结，提供香港给美国作为扩大侵略越南的战争和对中华人民共和国进行战争威胁和核讹诈的活动基地。
    照会最后强调，美国在香港的战备活动，孕育着对香港的严重后果。在中国安全日益遭到威胁的情况下，中国政府愿再一次提醒英国政府慎重权衡利害得失。英国政府必须立即采取有效措施，制止美国在香港的一切战备活动，使香港不再成为美国进行侵略活动的基地。如果英国政府执迷不悟，甘心充当美国侵略者的帮凶，执意要与越南人民、中国人民和东南亚各国人民为敌，那就必将自食其果。
