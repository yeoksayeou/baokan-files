　　Comrade Jiao Yulu Lives in Our Hearts
　　Yang Qingshan, Head of the Poor Peasants Association Group, Hancun Production Team, Chengguan Commune, Lankao County
    All the members of our team, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, say that although Comrade Jiao Yulu is dead, his spirit is still alive, living in our hearts, encouraging us to live and fight.
    Our team is located on both sides of the Longhai Railway, not far north of the village is the Yellow River levee, with all of waterlogging, wind and sand, and saline-alkali land. In the autumn of 1962, our team suffered a devastating flood, and each person only received twelve taels of sorghum ears. Faced with this severe disaster, some people were helpless, pessimistic, and passive. It was at this critical moment that Comrade Jiao Yulu came to our team. He held discussions with us poor and lower-middle peasants, promoting the Party's policy of self-reliance in production, teaching us to listen to Chairman Mao's words, and to rely on our own efforts. He said: "With the leadership of the Party, the people's communes, and the poor and lower-middle peasants who are experienced in fighting disasters, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome with solutions." He also inspired us, saying that even a chick has two claws to scratch for food, and people have two hands, so as long as they work, they won't have nothing to eat. After listening to Comrade Jiao Yulu's words, we felt warm in our hearts and saw hope and light in the difficulties. Once the ideological problem was solved, solutions were quickly discussed. Our team has a large area of sandy-alkali wasteland, growing a lot of cogongrass, and we are determined to cut and sell the grass to support ourselves and not ask the state for relief grain and relief funds. We haven't provided much support to the country, and we feel bad enough, so how can we drag the country down? When this matter was discussed by all the members, the vast majority supported it, but a few people were not very confident, saying that a catty of grass only sells for three or two cents, which is not a big deal. At that time, we poor and lower-middle peasants took the lead in cutting and selling grass, and in just five or six days, we earned more than 1,400 yuan. Those who were not very confident before also had confidence and actively participated in cutting and selling grass. After a winter and spring of hard work, we sold a total of 270,000 catties of grass, supporting ourselves, feeding our livestock, and also purchasing seven carts and adding more than ten pieces of farm equipment. Everyone said: "Money trees, everyone has one, all depends on one's own two hands."
    When our team had difficulties, Comrade Jiao Yulu encouraged us to find solutions; as soon as we made a little progress, Comrade Jiao Yulu publicized the revolutionary spirit of the people of Hancun in self-reliance and unity to overcome disasters, and promoted the "spirit of Hancun" everywhere, and invited me to speak at the Lankao County Agricultural Labor Model Conference. I recalled the painful scenes of fleeing famine and begging in the old society, and loved the Party and Chairman Mao even more. To say that the production self-rescue at that time was a bit successful, it should be attributed to Comrade Jiao Yulu, who was taught by the Party and Chairman Mao; to say that the revolutionary spirit of Hancun, it is better to say that Comrade Jiao Yulu's revolutionary spirit blossomed and bore fruit in our team.
    Since then, Comrade Jiao Yulu often came to our team, and there were three times that we will never forget. In the spring of 1963, Comrade Jiao Yulu came to our team again, helped us summarize the achievements of the previous stage of disaster resistance, and repeatedly explained the principle of relying on ourselves to completely liberate ourselves. He told us that production self-reliance is only a temporary measure, and that our revolution is not only to save ourselves, but also to save everyone, to save the Chinese people and the people of the world, and to realize communism. To realize this great ideal, we must eradicate the three scourges of waterlogging, wind and sand, and saline-alkali land with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, and completely change the poor and backward face of this place. He also launched a discussion among everyone to formulate a preliminary plan for eliminating the "three scourges" based on the actual situation here. At that time, he found that some people had ideas of fearing hardship, fearing fatigue, and fearing difficulties in realizing the plan, so he gave lectures on articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" at the members' meeting and the youth meeting respectively. He said: "Bethune is a foreigner, and he sacrificed his life for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. Don't we even want to sweat and exert ourselves to change the face of our hometown!" He also said: "The Foolish Old Man can move two mountains, so can't we eliminate the three scourges!" He asked us, especially the young people, to study Chairman Mao's works frequently, transform our thinking, and transform nature. After listening to his words, everyone was deeply moved and expressed their determination to overcome all difficulties and defeat the "three scourges" with the lofty aspirations of revolutionary martyrs and the spirit of the Foolish Old Man. In the spring of this year, we hauled silt from half a mile away and put a "plaster" on a three-mu sand dune; we also hauled sand and covered the fifteen-mu silt-alkali land south of the village with two or three inches, turning the silt-alkali soil into loam; we also dug nine drainage ditches on the 140-mu low-lying alkali land, and also dug a drainage canal that was one and a half miles long; in the sandy wasteland, we planted fifty mu of windbreak and sand-fixation forest.
    In the autumn of this year, our team suffered another major flood. Comrade Jiao Yulu came to our team with a cane, wading through the water, after hearing about it. We rushed to greet him and report the flooding situation to him. We said that although we are now suffering from flooding again, we have difficulties, but with the leadership of the Party and the experience of the previous struggle, we are not afraid of any difficulties. He smiled and said: "Your spirit is very good, don't be afraid if you fail, failure is the beginning of success." He also said: "It is not enough to just not be afraid, we must find out the cause of the flooding and the solution." We took him to the field to inspect it. He was very happy to see that the beans in the low-lying flat land were flooded and destroyed, but only the beans on the high ridges along the nine drainage ditches were not flooded. Before leaving, he repeatedly instructed us poor and lower-middle peasants to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and overcome the famine. According to Comrade Jiao Yulu's instructions, we carried out a variety of sideline production activities, with an income of more than 5,000 yuan. We did not ask the state for grain or money, we solved the difficulties in life ourselves, and we returned more than 1,000 yuan of loans to the state and purchased four head of livestock. Our team was encouraged by Comrade Jiao Yulu once again.
    One morning in the winter of 1963, Comrade Jiao Yulu came to our team again. The purpose of this visit was to lead six of us poor peasants to create a sample of two mu of terraced fields in the low-lying alkali land in the southwest of the village. He personally planned and personally carried a shovel to dig the soil with us. We knew he was sick and afraid of exhausting his body, and we repeatedly persuaded him to rest. He said: "It doesn't matter, we are suffering and tired now, we will break the root of poverty, and our descendants will have a good life for generations to come!" After digging for a morning, when it was time to eat lunch, he said that he had something important to go back to the county for, and he left. We felt very bad about it. After eating, as soon as we went to the field, we did not expect him to rush back to dig the terraced fields until it was dark before he left after digging the terraced fields. We wanted to keep him for dinner, and he said: "I will come to eat when the terraced fields are harvested!" Who knew that after he went back this time, his condition became more and more serious, and we could never see him again.
    Comrade Jiao Yulu was exhausted to death in order to eradicate the "three scourges" for us poor and lower-middle peasants. In the year or so after his death, we insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works, digging terraced fields, repairing rivers and digging ditches, and planting trees and making forests. Last year, we achieved a better harvest, and from a historical shortage of food, we became self-sufficient. The production team also stored more than 2,300 catties of grain.
    Recently, the revolutionary deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu have been published in the newspaper. All our members have read it several times, and we have used Comrade Jiao Yulu as an example to compare and examine the previous stage of production. Everyone unanimously expressed that we must hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and use greater revolutionary vigor to realize Secretary Jiao's hopes for Hancun during his lifetime and completely eradicate the "three scourges". Now, a new upsurge of production has been set off in our Hancun.

　　焦裕禄同志活在俺心底
　　兰考县城关公社韩村生产队贫协组长　杨青山
    俺队里的全体社员，特别是贫农下中农社员，都说焦裕禄同志虽然死了，但他的精神还活着，活在俺们心底，鼓励着俺们生活、战斗。
    俺队在陇海铁路两侧，村北边不多远就是黄河大堤，内涝、风沙、盐碱俱全。一九六二年秋季，俺队遭受了毁灭性的涝灾，每人只分了十二两红高粱穗。在这严重灾害面前，有些人束手无策，消极悲观。就在这节骨眼上，焦裕禄同志来到了俺队。他找俺们贫农下中农座谈，宣传党的生产自救方针，教导俺们要听毛主席的话，自力更生。他说：“有党的领导，有人民公社，有抗灾经验丰富的贫农下中农，再大的困难也能想出办法克服。”他还启发我们，小鸡还有两只爪可以挠食吃，人有两只手，只要劳动，就不会没啥吃。听了焦裕禄同志的话，俺们心里暖烘烘的，从困难中看到了希望，看到了光明。思想问题一解决，办法也很快讨论出来了。俺队有大片沙碱荒地，长着很多茅草，俺们决心割草卖草，养活自己，不向国家要救济粮救济款。俺们对国家没啥支援，心里就过意不去了，咋能再去拉国家后腿哩！这件事经全体社员讨论时，绝大多数人拥护，只有少数人信心不高，说是一斤草只卖三二分钱，不顶大事。当时，俺们贫农下中农就带头去割草卖草，仅五六天时间，就挣了一千四百多元，原来信心不高的人也有信心了，积极参加割草卖草。经过一个冬、春的艰苦奋斗，共卖草二十七万斤，养活了自己，养活了牲畜，还购买了七辆架子车，添置了十多件农具。大家纷纷说：“摇钱树，人人有，全靠自己一双手。”
    俺队有困难，焦裕禄同志鼓励俺们想办法；俺们刚作出一点成绩，焦裕禄同志又到处宣扬俺韩村人自力更生、团结救灾的革命精神，到处提倡“韩村的精神”，并请俺到兰考县农业劳动模范大会上讲话。俺想起在旧社会遭灾后逃荒要饭的惨痛情景，更加热爱党和毛主席。要说当时生产自救有点成绩，应该归功于党和毛主席教导出来的焦裕禄同志；要说韩村的革命精神，不如说是焦裕禄同志的革命精神在俺队开了花，结了果。
    自这以后，焦裕禄同志经常不断来俺队，其中有三次俺们永远不会忘记。一九六三年春天，焦裕禄同志又来到俺队，帮助俺们总结了前段抗灾的成绩，反复说明依靠自己完全可以解放自己的道理。他告诉俺们，生产自救只是临时性的措施，咱们干革命不仅要救自己，还要救大家，救中国人民和世界人民，实现共产主义。要实现这一伟大理想，咱们必须以自力更生的革命精神，根除这里的内涝、风沙、盐碱三害，彻底改变这里贫穷落后的面貌。他还根据这里的实际情况，发动大家讨论制订了除“三害”的初步规划。当时，他发现有些人对实现规划存在着怕苦、怕累、怕困难的思想，就分别在社员会和青年会上，讲《纪念白求恩》《为人民服务》《愚公移山》等文章。他说：“白求恩是外国人，他为中国人民的革命事业牺牲了性命，咱们为改变家乡面貌，难道还不肯流汗出力！”还说：“愚公能移掉两座大山，咱们就不能除掉三害！”他要求俺们尤其是青年人要经常学习毛主席著作，改造思想，改造自然。听了他的话，大家深受感动，表示决心要以革命先烈的壮志，以愚公的精神，排除万难，战胜“三害”。就在这年春天，俺们从半里路远拉来淤土，给三亩大的一个沙堆贴上了“膏药”；又拉沙土，把村南十五亩淤土碱地盖上二三寸，把淤碱土改变为两和土；又在一百四十亩洼碱地上，挖了九条排水沟，还挖了一条一里半长的排水渠道；在沙荒地里，栽植了五十亩防风固沙林。
    这年秋季，俺队又遭到了一次大的涝灾。焦裕禄同志听说了，拄着棍，趟着水，来到了俺队。俺们纷纷迎上去向他汇报受淹情况。俺们说虽然眼下又遭涝灾，有困难，但是有党的领导，有前一段斗争的经验，再大的困难也不害怕了。他笑了笑说：“你们这种精神很好，失败了，不要怕，失败是成功的开始。”他还说：“光是不怕还不够，必须找出被淹原因和解决办法。”俺们带他去地里察看了一番。他看到低洼平地的豆子淹毁，唯有那九条排水沟地边高顶上的豆子没有淹毁，很是高兴。临走时，他一再指示俺们贫农下中农，要发扬自力更生的革命精神，战胜灾荒。俺们按照焦裕禄同志的指示，开展了多种副业生产活动，收入达五千多元。没有向国家要粮要钱，自己解决了生活上的困难，并归还国家一千多元贷款，购买了四头牲畜。俺队又一次得到焦裕禄同志的鼓励。
    一九六三年冬季一天上午，焦裕禄同志再次到俺队来了。这次来的目的，是带领俺们六个贫农在村西南洼碱地搞一块二亩台田的样板。他亲自规划，亲自扛起铁锨和俺们一起挖土。俺们知道他有病，怕累坏他的身子，几次劝他休息。他说：“不要紧，咱们眼下吃苦受累，挖断穷根，子孙万代才有好日子过！”挖了一晌，到吃中午饭时，他说是有要紧事回县，拔腿就走了。俺们心里很是过意不去。吃罢饭，刚下地，料想不到他又赶来挖台田，直到天黑把这块台田挖好才走。俺们想留他吃顿晚饭，他说：“台田丰收了，我再来吃吧！”谁知道他这次回去后，病情一天天重了起来，再也不能见到他了。
    焦裕禄同志是为俺们贫农下中农根除“三害”劳累死的。在他病故后一年多里，俺们坚持学习毛主席著作，开挖台田，修河挖沟，植树造林，去年获得了较好收成，由历史上缺粮变成自给有余，生产队还储备了二千三百多斤粮食。
    最近报纸上发表了焦裕禄同志的革命事迹，俺全体社员在一起读了好几遍，并且以焦裕禄同志为榜样，来对照检查了前一段生产。大家一致表示，要高举毛泽东思想红旗，以更大的革命干劲，来实现焦书记生前对韩村的希望，彻底根除“三害”。现在，俺韩村已经掀起了一个新的生产高潮。
