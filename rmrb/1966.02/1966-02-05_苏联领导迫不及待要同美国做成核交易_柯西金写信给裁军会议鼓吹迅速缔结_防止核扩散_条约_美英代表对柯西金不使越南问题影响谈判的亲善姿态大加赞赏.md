    Xinhua News Agency, February 4th. Following their line of US-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world, the Soviet leaders are wholeheartedly seeking to reach a so-called "non-proliferation" agreement with the United States to maintain their nuclear hegemonic status.

    According to a TASS report on February 2nd, Soviet Premier Kosygin, in a letter to participants of the United Nations Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee in Geneva, stated that "The Soviet government insists that a treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons must be concluded without delay."

    In his letter, Kosygin hypocritically touted that "In order to facilitate agreement on the conclusion of the treaty, the Soviet government declares its willingness to include in the draft treaty a provision prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states participating in the treaty that do not have nuclear weapons on their territory."

    The letter emphasized that "The task of implementing the entire set of measures for the reduction of nuclear armaments now occupies a primary position in the work of the Eighteen-Nation Committee," that the Soviet Union wants to "actively participate in the work of the Disarmament Committee," and is "willing to study and consider, without prejudice, the proposals of any other delegation."

    In his letter, Kosygin once again peddled the "concrete program for complete and thorough disarmament, the abolition of armed forces and the destruction of armaments" and the "economic program of disarmament" that the Khrushchev revisionists had already bankrupted. The letter proclaimed that the economic program of disarmament "enables all countries of the world to improve the welfare of the people in a short historical period, and enables those countries and peoples lagging behind due to the sins of colonialism to eliminate their own economic backwardness and step onto the level of modern civilization."

    When mentioning the Vietnam War in his letter, Kosygin did not dare to explicitly condemn the aggressive crimes of US imperialism, but only glossed over it, saying, "The flames of war have been raging in Vietnam for a long time, and the freedom-loving Vietnamese people have become victims of imperialist armed intervention."

    Kosygin's letter was immediately praised by representatives from the US, Britain, and other countries. According to a Reuters report, US chief negotiator Foster expressed "praise" for the letter and said, "This letter indicates Kosygin's hope to advance the work of the meeting, and the United States will study it carefully." British Disarmament Minister Chalfont said, "This suggestion is encouraging and constructive. Britain will study it sympathetically."

    According to an AP report, Western officials believe that "this is a positive step on the road to nuclear disarmament," and "this letter is part of the continued effort by the Soviet Union not to let the Vietnam War break up the meeting." Western officials also believe that "Kosygin's tone is encouraging because it seems to confirm that the Soviets are truly determined to completely separate disarmament negotiations and the Vietnam issue."

    AFP reported that "Westerners pointed out that this letter confirms that Moscow is as interested in the current meeting as the Western countries." "Westerners said that, given the Sino-Soviet dispute, the Security Council's debate on the Vietnam issue, and the resumption of US air strikes against North Vietnam, this letter seems like a friendly gesture that could be conducive to effective disarmament negotiations."

    苏联领导迫不及待要同美国做成核交易
    柯西金写信给裁军会议鼓吹迅速缔结“防止核扩散”条约
    美英代表对柯西金不使越南问题影响谈判的亲善姿态大加赞赏
    新华社四日讯　苏联领导人从他们奉行的美苏合作主宰世界的路线出发，一心一意地想和美国达成维持它们核霸王地位的所谓“防止核扩散”协议。
    据塔斯社二日报道，苏联部长会议主席柯西金在给日内瓦举行的联合国十八国裁军委员会参加者的一封信中说，“苏联政府坚持主张必须毫不拖延地缔结不扩散核武器条约。”
    柯西金在信中别有用心地鼓吹，“为了便于就缔结条约达成协议，苏联政府声明愿意在条约草案中列入这样一条，禁止使用核武器来反对在自己的领土上没有核武器的参加条约的非核国家。”
    信中强调说，“实现有关裁减核军备的整套措施的任务，现在居于十八国委员会工作的首要地位”，苏联要“积极参与裁军委员会的工作”，并且“愿意没有偏见地研究和考虑任何其他代表团的建议”。
    柯西金在信中又一次地兜售赫鲁晓夫修正主义者早已破产了的“完全废除武装部队和销毁军备的具体的全面彻底裁军的纲领”和关于“裁军的经济纲领”。信中宣扬说，关于裁军的经济纲领“使世界各国有可能在短短的历史时期内提高人民的福利，而且使那些由于殖民主义的罪过而落后的国家和人民有可能消除本国经济落后状态，跨上现代文明的水平。”
    柯西金在信中提到越南战争时，不敢指名谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行，只是轻描淡写地说，“战争的火焰在越南熊熊燃烧已有很长时期，热爱自由的越南人民成了帝国主义武装干涉的受害者”。
    柯西金的信立即受到美、英等国代表们的赞赏。据路透社报道，美国首席谈判代表福斯特对这封信表示“赞扬”，并说，“这封信表示了柯西金希望推进会议的工作，美国将予以仔细研究。”英国裁军大臣查尔方特说，“这个建议是令人鼓舞的和建设性的。英国将予以同情地研究。”
    据美联社报道，西方官员们认为“这是核裁军道路上积极的一步”，“这封信是苏联不让越南战争使会议破裂而作出的持续努力的一部分。”西方官员还认为，“柯西金的语气是令人鼓舞的，因为它似乎证实苏联人真正决心要使裁军谈判和越南问题完全分开。”
    法新社报道说，“西方人士指出，这封信证实了，莫斯科对目前的会议象西方国家一样感兴趣。”“西方人士说，鉴于中苏争吵，安理会辩论越南问题，美国恢复对北越的空中攻势，这封信看来象是可以有利于有效的裁军谈判的一个亲善姿态。”
